language
an
introduction
to
the
study
of
speech
by
edward
sapir
preface
this
little
book
aims
to
give
a
certain
perspective
on
the
subject
of
language
rather
than
to
assemble
facts
about
it
it
has
little
to
say
of
the
ultimate
psychological
basis
of
speech
and
gives
only
enough
of
the
actual
descriptive
or
historical
facts
of
particular
languages
to
illustrate
principles
its
main
purpose
is
to
show
what
i
conceive
language
to
be
what
is
its
variability
in
place
and
time
and
what
are
its
relations
to
other
fundamental
human
interests
the
problem
of
thought
the
nature
of
the
historical
process
race
culture
art
the
perspective
thus
gained
will
be
useful
i
hope
both
to
linguistic
students
and
to
the
outside
public
that
is
half
inclined
to
dismiss
linguistic
notions
as
the
private
pedantries
of
essentially
idle
minds
knowledge
of
the
wider
relations
of
their
science
is
essential
to
professional
students
of
language
if
they
are
to
be
saved
from
a
sterile
and
purely
technical
attitude
among
contemporary
writers
of
influence
on
liberal
thought
croce
is
one
of
the
very
few
who
have
gained
an
understanding
of
the
fundamental
significance
of
language
he
has
pointed
out
its
close
relation
to
the
problem
of
art
i
am
deeply
indebted
to
him
for
this
insight
quite
aside
from
their
intrinsic
interest
linguistic
forms
and
historical
processes
have
the
greatest
possible
diagnostic
value
for
the
understanding
of
some
of
the
more
difficult
and
elusive
problems
in
the
psychology
of
thought
and
in
the
strange
cumulative
drift
in
the
life
of
the
human
spirit
that
we
call
history
or
progress
or
evolution
this
value
depends
chiefly
on
the
unconscious
and
unrationalized
nature
of
linguistic
structure
i
have
avoided
most
of
the
technical
terms
and
all
of
the
technical
symbols
of
the
linguistic
academy
there
is
not
a
single
diacritical
mark
in
the
book
where
possible
the
discussion
is
based
on
english
material
it
was
necessary
however
for
the
scheme
of
the
book
which
includes
a
consideration
of
the
protean
forms
in
which
human
thought
has
found
expression
to
quote
some
exotic
instances
for
these
no
apology
seems
necessary
owing
to
limitations
of
space
i
have
had
to
leave
out
many
ideas
or
principles
that
i
should
have
liked
to
touch
upon
other
points
have
had
to
be
barely
hinted
at
in
a
sentence
or
flying
phrase
nevertheless
i
trust
that
enough
has
here
been
brought
together
to
serve
as
a
stimulus
for
the
more
fundamental
study
of
a
neglected
field
i
desire
to
express
my
cordial
appreciation
of
the
friendly
advice
and
helpful
suggestions
of
a
number
of
friends
who
have
read
the
work
in

kroeber

of

index
i
introductory
language
defined
speech
is
so
familiar
a
feature
of
daily
life
that
we
rarely
pause
to
define
it
it
seems
as
natural
to
man
as
walking
and
only
less
so
than
breathing
yet
it
needs
but
a
moment
reflection
to
convince
us
that
this
naturalness
of
speech
is
but
an
illusory
feeling
the
process
of
acquiring
speech
is
in
sober
fact
an
utterly
different
sort
of
thing
from
the
process
of
learning
to
walk
in
the
case
of
the
latter
function
culture
in
other
words
the
traditional
body
of
social
usage
is
not
seriously
brought
into
play
the
child
is
individually
equipped
by
the
complex
set
of
factors
that
we
term
biological
heredity
to
make
all
the
needed
muscular
and
nervous
adjustments
that
result
in
walking
indeed
the
very
conformation
of
these
muscles
and
of
the
appropriate
parts
of
the
nervous
system
may
be
said
to
be
primarily
adapted
to
the
movements
made
in
walking
and
in
similar
activities
in
a
very
real
sense
the
normal
human
being
is
predestined
to
walk
not
because
his
elders
will
assist
him
to
learn
the
art
but
because
his
organism
is
prepared
from
birth
or
even
from
the
moment
of
conception
to
take
on
all
those
expenditures
of
nervous
energy
and
all
those
muscular
adaptations
that
result
in
walking
to
put
it
concisely
walking
is
an
inherent
biological
function
of
man
not
so
language
it
is
of
course
true
that
in
a
certain
sense
the
individual
is
predestined
to
talk
but
that
is
due
entirely
to
the
circumstance
that
he
is
born
not
merely
in
nature
but
in
the
lap
of
a
society
that
is
certain
reasonably
certain
to
lead
him
to
its
traditions
eliminate
society
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
will
learn
to
walk
if
indeed
he
survives
at
all
but
it
is
just
as
certain
that
he
will
never
learn
to
talk
that
is
to
communicate
ideas
according
to
the
traditional
system
of
a
particular
society
or
again
remove
the
individual
from
the
social
environment
into
which
he
has
come
and
transplant
him
to
an
utterly
alien
one
he
will
develop
the
art
of
walking
in
his
new
environment
very
much
as
he
would
have
developed
it
in
the
old
but
his
speech
will
be
completely
at
variance
with
the
speech
of
his
native
environment
walking
then
is
a
general
human
activity
that
varies
only
within
circumscribed
limits
as
we
pass
from
individual
to
individual
its
variability
is
involuntary
and
purposeless
speech
is
a
human
activity
that
varies
without
assignable
limit
as
we
pass
from
social
group
to
social
group
because
it
is
a
purely
historical
heritage
of
the
group
the
product
of
social
usage
it
varies
as
all
creative
effort
varies
not
as
consciously
perhaps
but
none
the
less
as
truly
as
do
the
religions
the
beliefs
the
customs
and
the
arts
of
different
peoples
walking
is
an
organic
an
instinctive
function
not
of
course
itself
an
instinct
speech
is
a
acquired
cultural
function
there
is
one
fact
that
has
frequently
tended
to
prevent
the
recognition
of
language
as
a
merely
conventional
system
of
sound
symbols
that
has
seduced
the
popular
mind
into
attributing
to
it
an
instinctive
basis
that
it
does
not
really
possess
this
is
the
observation
that
under
the
stress
of
emotion
say
of
a
sudden
twinge
of
pain
or
of
unbridled
joy
we
do
involuntarily
give
utterance
to
sounds
that
the
hearer
interprets
as
indicative
of
the
emotion
itself
but
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
such
involuntary
expression
of
feeling
and
the
normal
type
of
communication
of
ideas
that
is
speech
the
former
kind
of
utterance
is
indeed
instinctive
but
it
is
in
other
words
the
sound
of
pain
or
the
sound
of
joy
does
not
as
such
indicate
the
emotion
it
does
not
stand
aloof
as
it
were
and
announce
that
such
and
such
an
emotion
is
being
felt
what
it
does
is
to
serve
as
a
more
or
less
automatic
overflow
of
the
emotional
energy
in
a
sense
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
emotion
itself
moreover
such
instinctive
cries
hardly
constitute
communication
in
any
strict
sense
they
are
not
addressed
to
any
one
they
are
merely
overheard
if
heard
at
all
as
the
bark
of
a
dog
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
or
the
rustling
of
the
wind
is
heard
if
they
convey
certain
ideas
to
the
hearer
it
is
only
in
the
very
general
sense
in
which
any
and
every
sound
or
even
any
phenomenon
in
our
environment
may
be
said
to
convey
an
idea
to
the
perceiving
mind
if
the
involuntary
cry
of
pain
which
is
conventionally
represented
by
oh
be
looked
upon
as
a
true
speech
symbol
equivalent
to
some
such
idea
as
i
am
in
great
pain
it
is
just
as
allowable
to
interpret
the
appearance
of
clouds
as
an
equivalent
symbol
that
carries
the
definite
message
it
is
likely
to
rain
a
definition
of
language
however
that
is
so
extended
as
to
cover
every
type
of
inference
becomes
utterly
meaningless
the
mistake
must
not
be
made
of
identifying
our
conventional
interjections
our
oh
and
ah
and
sh
with
the
instinctive
cries
themselves
these
interjections
are
merely
conventional
fixations
of
the
natural
sounds
they
therefore
differ
widely
in
various
languages
in
accordance
with
the
specific
phonetic
genius
of
each
of
these
as
such
they
may
be
considered
an
integral
portion
of
speech
in
the
properly
cultural
sense
of
the
term
being
no
more
identical
with
the
instinctive
cries
themselves
than
such
words
as
cuckoo
and
are
identical
with
the
cries
of
the
birds
they
denote
or
than
treatment
of
a
storm
in
the
overture
to
william
tell
is
in
fact
a
storm
in
other
words
the
interjections
and
words
of
normal
speech
are
related
to
their
natural
prototypes
as
is
art
a
purely
social
or
cultural
thing
to
nature
it
may
be
objected
that
though
the
interjections
differ
somewhat
as
we
pass
from
language
to
language
they
do
nevertheless
offer
striking
family
resemblances
and
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
having
grown
up
out
of
a
common
instinctive
base
but
their
case
is
nowise
different
from
that
say
of
the
varying
national
modes
of
pictorial
representation
a
japanese
picture
of
a
hill
both
differs
from
and
resembles
a
typical
modern
european
painting
of
the
same
kind
of
hill
both
are
suggested
by
and
both
imitate
the
same
natural
feature
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
the
same
thing
as
or
in
any
intelligible
sense
a
direct
outgrowth
of
this
natural
feature
the
two
modes
of
representation
are
not
identical
because
they
proceed
from
differing
historical
traditions
are
executed
with
differing
pictorial
techniques
the
interjections
of
japanese
and
english
are
just
so
suggested
by
a
common
natural
prototype
the
instinctive
cries
and
are
thus
unavoidably
suggestive
of
each
other
they
differ
now
greatly
now
but
little
because
they
are
builded
out
of
historically
diverse
materials
or
techniques
the
respective
linguistic
traditions
phonetic
systems
speech
habits
of
the
two
peoples
yet
the
instinctive
cries
as
such
are
practically
identical
for
all
humanity
just
as
the
human
skeleton
or
nervous
system
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
fixed
that
is
an
only
slightly
and
accidentally
variable
feature
of
man
organism
interjections
are
among
the
least
important
of
speech
elements
their
discussion
is
valuable
mainly
because
it
can
be
shown
that
even
they
avowedly
the
nearest
of
all
language
sounds
to
instinctive
utterance
are
only
superficially
of
an
instinctive
nature
were
it
therefore
possible
to
demonstrate
that
the
whole
of
language
is
traceable
in
its
ultimate
historical
and
psychological
foundations
to
the
interjections
it
would
still
not
follow
that
language
is
an
instinctive
activity
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
attempts
so
to
explain
the
origin
of
speech
have
been
fruitless
there
is
no
tangible
evidence
historical
or
otherwise
tending
to
show
that
the
mass
of
speech
elements
and
speech
processes
has
evolved
out
of
the
interjections
these
are
a
very
small
and
functionally
insignificant
proportion
of
the
vocabulary
of
language
at
no
time
and
in
no
linguistic
province
that
we
have
record
of
do
we
see
a
noticeable
tendency
towards
their
elaboration
into
the
primary
warp
and
woof
of
language
they
are
never
more
at
best
than
a
decorative
edging
to
the
ample
complex
fabric
what
applies
to
the
interjections
applies
with
even
greater
force
to
the
words
such
words
as
whippoorwill
to
mew
to
caw
are
in
no
sense
natural
sounds
that
man
has
instinctively
or
automatically
reproduced
they
are
just
as
truly
creations
of
the
human
mind
flights
of
the
human
fancy
as
anything
else
in
language
they
do
not
directly
grow
out
of
nature
they
are
suggested
by
it
and
play
with
it
hence
the
onomatopoetic
theory
of
the
origin
of
speech
the
theory
that
would
explain
all
speech
as
a
gradual
evolution
from
sounds
of
an
imitative
character
really
brings
us
no
nearer
to
the
instinctive
level
than
is
language
as
we
know
it
as
to
the
theory
itself
it
is
scarcely
more
credible
than
its
interjectional
counterpart
it
is
true
that
a
number
of
words
which
we
do
not
now
feel
to
have
a
value
can
be
shown
to
have
once
had
a
phonetic
form
that
strongly
suggests
their
origin
as
imitations
of
natural
sounds
such
is
the
english
word
to
laugh
for
all
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
show
nor
does
it
seem
intrinsically
reasonable
to
suppose
that
more
than
a
negligible
proportion
of
the
elements
of
speech
or
anything
at
all
of
its
formal
apparatus
is
derivable
from
an
onomatopoetic
source
however
much
we
may
be
disposed
on
general
principles
to
assign
a
fundamental
importance
in
the
languages
of
primitive
peoples
to
the
imitation
of
natural
sounds
the
actual
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
languages
show
no
particular
preference
for
imitative
words
among
the
most
primitive
peoples
of
aboriginal
america
the
athabaskan
tribes
of
the
mackenzie
river
speak
languages
in
which
such
words
seem
to
be
nearly
or
entirely
absent
while
they
are
used
freely
enough
in
languages
as
sophisticated
as
english
and
german
such
an
instance
shows
how
little
the
essential
nature
of
speech
is
concerned
with
the
mere
imitation
of
things
the
way
is
now
cleared
for
a
serviceable
definition
of
language
language
is
a
purely
human
and
method
of
communicating
ideas
emotions
and
desires
by
means
of
a
system
of
voluntarily
produced
symbols
these
symbols
are
in
the
first
instance
auditory
and
they
are
produced
by
the
organs
of
speech
there
is
no
discernible
instinctive
basis
in
human
speech
as
such
however
much
instinctive
expressions
and
the
natural
environment
may
serve
as
a
stimulus
for
the
development
of
certain
elements
of
speech
however
much
instinctive
tendencies
motor
and
other
may
give
a
predetermined
range
or
mold
to
linguistic
expression
such
human
or
animal
communication
if
communication
it
may
be
called
as
is
brought
about
by
involuntary
instinctive
cries
is
not
in
our
sense
language
at
all
i
have
just
referred
to
the
organs
of
speech
and
it
would
seem
at
first
blush
that
this
is
tantamount
to
an
admission
that
speech
itself
is
an
instinctive
biologically
predetermined
activity
we
must
not
be
misled
by
the
mere
term
there
are
properly
speaking
no
organs
of
speech
there
are
only
organs
that
are
incidentally
useful
in
the
production
of
speech
sounds
the
lungs
the
larynx
the
palate
the
nose
the
tongue
the
teeth
and
the
lips
are
all
so
utilized
but
they
are
no
more
to
be
thought
of
as
primary
organs
of
speech
than
are
the
fingers
to
be
considered
as
essentially
organs
of
or
the
knees
as
organs
of
prayer
speech
is
not
a
simple
activity
that
is
carried
on
by
one
or
more
organs
biologically
adapted
to
the
purpose
it
is
an
extremely
complex
and
network
of
adjustments
in
the
brain
in
the
nervous
system
and
in
the
articulating
and
auditory
organs
tending
towards
the
desired
end
of
communication
the
lungs
developed
roughly
speaking
in
connection
with
the
necessary
biological
function
known
as
breathing
the
nose
as
an
organ
of
smell
the
teeth
as
organs
useful
in
breaking
up
food
before
it
was
ready
for
digestion
if
then
these
and
other
organs
are
being
constantly
utilized
in
speech
it
is
only
because
any
organ
once
existent
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
subject
to
voluntary
control
can
be
utilized
by
man
for
secondary
purposes
physiologically
speech
is
an
overlaid
function
or
to
be
more
precise
a
group
of
overlaid
functions
it
gets
what
service
it
can
out
of
organs
and
functions
nervous
and
muscular
that
have
come
into
being
and
are
maintained
for
very
different
ends
than
its
own
it
is
true
that
physiological
psychologists
speak
of
the
localization
of
speech
in
the
brain
this
can
only
mean
that
the
sounds
of
speech
are
localized
in
the
auditory
tract
of
the
brain
or
in
some
circumscribed
portion
of
it
precisely
as
other
classes
of
sounds
are
localized
and
that
the
motor
processes
involved
in
speech
such
as
the
movements
of
the
glottal
cords
in
the
larynx
the
movements
of
the
tongue
required
to
pronounce
the
vowels
lip
movements
required
to
articulate
certain
consonants
and
numerous
others
are
localized
in
the
motor
tract
precisely
as
are
all
other
impulses
to
special
motor
activities
in
the
same
way
control
is
lodged
in
the
visual
tract
of
the
brain
over
all
those
processes
of
visual
recognition
involved
in
reading
naturally
the
particular
points
or
clusters
of
points
of
localization
in
the
several
tracts
that
refer
to
any
element
of
language
are
connected
in
the
brain
by
paths
of
association
so
that
the
outward
or
aspect
of
language
is
of
a
vast
network
of
associated
localizations
in
the
brain
and
lower
nervous
tracts
the
auditory
localizations
being
without
doubt
the
most
fundamental
of
all
for
speech
however
a
speechsound
localized
in
the
brain
even
when
associated
with
the
particular
movements
of
the
speech
organs
that
are
required
to
produce
it
is
very
far
from
being
an
element
of
language
it
must
be
further
associated
with
some
element
or
group
of
elements
of
experience
say
a
visual
image
or
a
class
of
visual
images
or
a
feeling
of
relation
before
it
has
even
rudimentary
linguistic
significance
this
element
of
experience
is
the
content
or
meaning
of
the
linguistic
unit
the
associated
auditory
motor
and
other
cerebral
processes
that
lie
immediately
back
of
the
act
of
speaking
and
the
act
of
hearing
speech
are
merely
a
complicated
symbol
of
or
signal
for
these
meanings
of
which
more
anon
we
see
therefore
at
once
that
language
as
such
is
not
and
can
not
be
definitely
localized
for
it
consists
of
a
peculiar
symbolic
relation
physiologically
an
arbitrary
one
between
all
possible
elements
of
consciousness
on
the
one
hand
and
certain
selected
elements
localized
in
the
auditory
motor
and
other
cerebral
and
nervous
tracts
on
the
other
if
language
can
be
said
to
be
definitely
localized
in
the
brain
it
is
only
in
that
general
and
rather
useless
sense
in
which
all
aspects
of
consciousness
all
human
interest
and
activity
may
be
said
to
be
in
the
brain
hence
we
have
no
recourse
but
to
accept
language
as
a
fully
formed
functional
system
within
psychic
or
spiritual
constitution
we
can
not
define
it
as
an
entity
in
terms
alone
however
much
the
basis
is
essential
to
its
functioning
in
the
individual
from
the
physiologist
or
psychologist
point
of
view
we
may
seem
to
be
making
an
unwarrantable
abstraction
in
desiring
to
handle
the
subject
of
speech
without
constant
and
explicit
reference
to
that
basis
however
such
an
abstraction
is
justifiable
we
can
profitably
discuss
the
intention
the
form
and
the
history
of
speech
precisely
as
we
discuss
the
nature
of
any
other
phase
of
human
culture
say
art
or
religion
as
an
institutional
or
cultural
entity
leaving
the
organic
and
psychological
mechanisms
back
of
it
as
something
to
be
taken
for
granted
accordingly
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
this
introduction
to
the
study
of
speech
is
not
concerned
with
those
aspects
of
physiology
and
of
physiological
psychology
that
underlie
speech
our
study
of
language
is
not
to
be
one
of
the
genesis
and
operation
of
a
concrete
mechanism
it
is
rather
to
be
an
inquiry
into
the
function
and
form
of
the
arbitrary
systems
of
symbolism
that
we
term
languages
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
the
essence
of
language
consists
in
the
assigning
of
conventional
voluntarily
articulated
sounds
or
of
their
equivalents
to
the
diverse
elements
of
experience
the
word
house
is
not
a
linguistic
fact
if
by
it
is
meant
merely
the
acoustic
effect
produced
on
the
ear
by
its
constituent
consonants
and
vowels
pronounced
in
a
certain
order
nor
the
motor
processes
and
tactile
feelings
which
make
up
the
articulation
of
the
word
nor
the
visual
perception
on
the
part
of
the
hearer
of
this
articulation
nor
the
visual
perception
of
the
word
house
on
the
written
or
printed
page
nor
the
motor
processes
and
tactile
feelings
which
enter
into
the
writing
of
the
word
nor
the
memory
of
any
or
all
of
these
experiences
it
is
only
when
these
and
possibly
still
other
associated
experiences
are
automatically
associated
with
the
image
of
a
house
that
they
begin
to
take
on
the
nature
of
a
symbol
a
word
an
element
of
language
but
the
mere
fact
of
such
an
association
is
not
enough
one
might
have
heard
a
particular
word
spoken
in
an
individual
house
under
such
impressive
circumstances
that
neither
the
word
nor
the
image
of
the
house
ever
recur
in
consciousness
without
the
other
becoming
present
at
the
same
time
this
type
of
association
does
not
constitute
speech
the
association
must
be
a
purely
symbolic
one
in
other
words
the
word
must
denote
tag
off
the
image
must
have
no
other
significance
than
to
serve
as
a
counter
to
refer
to
it
whenever
it
is
necessary
or
convenient
to
do
so
such
an
association
voluntary
and
in
a
sense
arbitrary
as
it
is
demands
a
considerable
exercise
of
attention
at
least
to
begin
with
for
habit
soon
makes
the
association
nearly
as
automatic
as
any
and
more
rapid
than
most
but
we
have
traveled
a
little
too
fast
were
the
symbol
house
whether
an
auditory
motor
or
visual
experience
or
image
attached
but
to
the
single
image
of
a
particular
house
once
seen
it
might
perhaps
by
an
indulgent
criticism
be
termed
an
element
of
speech
yet
it
is
obvious
at
the
outset
that
speech
so
constituted
would
have
little
or
no
value
for
purposes
of
communication
the
world
of
our
experiences
must
be
enormously
simplified
and
generalized
before
it
is
possible
to
make
a
symbolic
inventory
of
all
our
experiences
of
things
and
relations
and
this
inventory
is
imperative
before
we
can
convey
ideas
the
elements
of
language
the
symbols
that
ticket
off
experience
must
therefore
be
associated
with
whole
groups
delimited
classes
of
experience
rather
than
with
the
single
experiences
themselves
only
so
is
communication
possible
for
the
single
experience
lodges
in
an
individual
consciousness
and
is
strictly
speaking
incommunicable
to
be
communicated
it
needs
to
be
referred
to
a
class
which
is
tacitly
accepted
by
the
community
as
an
identity
thus
the
single
impression
which
i
have
had
of
a
particular
house
must
be
identified
with
all
my
other
impressions
of
it
further
my
generalized
memory
or
my
notion
of
this
house
must
be
merged
with
the
notions
that
all
other
individuals
who
have
seen
the
house
have
formed
of
it
the
particular
experience
that
we
started
with
has
now
been
widened
so
as
to
embrace
all
possible
impressions
or
images
that
sentient
beings
have
formed
or
may
form
of
the
house
in
question
this
first
simplification
of
experience
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
large
number
of
elements
of
speech
the
proper
nouns
or
names
of
single
individuals
or
objects
it
is
essentially
the
type
of
simplification
which
underlies
or
forms
the
crude
subject
of
history
and
art
but
we
can
not
be
content
with
this
measure
of
reduction
of
the
infinity
of
experience
we
must
cut
to
the
bone
of
things
we
must
more
or
less
arbitrarily
throw
whole
masses
of
experience
together
as
similar
enough
to
warrant
their
being
looked
upon
mistakenly
but
conveniently
as
identical
this
house
and
that
house
and
thousands
of
other
phenomena
of
like
character
are
thought
of
as
having
enough
in
common
in
spite
of
great
and
obvious
differences
of
detail
to
be
classed
under
the
same
heading
in
other
words
the
speech
element
house
is
the
symbol
first
and
foremost
not
of
a
single
perception
nor
even
of
the
notion
of
a
particular
object
but
of
a
concept
in
other
words
of
a
convenient
capsule
of
thought
that
embraces
thousands
of
distinct
experiences
and
that
is
ready
to
take
in
thousands
more
if
the
single
significant
elements
of
speech
are
the
symbols
of
concepts
the
actual
flow
of
speech
may
be
interpreted
as
a
record
of
the
setting
of
these
concepts
into
mutual
relations
the
question
has
often
been
raised
whether
thought
is
possible
without
speech
further
if
speech
and
thought
be
not
but
two
facets
of
the
same
psychic
process
the
question
is
all
the
more
difficult
because
it
has
been
hedged
about
by
misunderstandings
in
the
first
place
it
is
well
to
observe
that
whether
or
not
thought
necessitates
symbolism
that
is
speech
the
flow
of
language
itself
is
not
always
indicative
of
thought
we
have
seen
that
the
typical
linguistic
element
labels
a
concept
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
the
use
to
which
language
is
put
is
always
or
even
mainly
conceptual
we
are
not
in
ordinary
life
so
much
concerned
with
concepts
as
such
as
with
concrete
particularities
and
specific
relations
when
i
say
for
instance
i
had
a
good
breakfast
this
morning
it
is
clear
that
i
am
not
in
the
throes
of
laborious
thought
that
what
i
have
to
transmit
is
hardly
more
than
a
pleasurable
memory
symbolically
rendered
in
the
grooves
of
habitual
expression
each
element
in
the
sentence
defines
a
separate
concept
or
conceptual
relation
or
both
combined
but
the
sentence
as
a
whole
has
no
conceptual
significance
whatever
it
is
somewhat
as
though
a
dynamo
capable
of
generating
enough
power
to
run
an
elevator
were
operated
almost
exclusively
to
feed
an
electric
the
parallel
is
more
suggestive
than
at
first
sight
appears
language
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
instrument
capable
of
running
a
gamut
of
psychic
uses
its
flow
not
only
parallels
that
of
the
inner
content
of
consciousness
but
parallels
it
on
different
levels
ranging
from
the
state
of
mind
that
is
dominated
by
particular
images
to
that
in
which
abstract
concepts
and
their
relations
are
alone
at
the
focus
of
attention
and
which
is
ordinarily
termed
reasoning
thus
the
outward
form
only
of
language
is
constant
its
inner
meaning
its
psychic
value
or
intensity
varies
freely
with
attention
or
the
selective
interest
of
the
mind
also
needless
to
say
with
the
mind
general
development
from
the
point
of
view
of
language
thought
may
be
defined
as
the
highest
latent
or
potential
content
of
speech
the
content
that
is
obtained
by
interpreting
each
of
the
elements
in
the
flow
of
language
as
possessed
of
its
very
fullest
conceptual
value
from
this
it
follows
at
once
that
language
and
thought
are
not
strictly
coterminous
at
best
language
can
but
be
the
outward
facet
of
thought
on
the
highest
most
generalized
level
of
symbolic
expression
to
put
our
viewpoint
somewhat
differently
language
is
primarily
a
function
it
humbly
works
up
to
the
thought
that
is
latent
in
that
may
eventually
be
read
into
its
classifications
and
its
forms
it
is
not
as
is
generally
but
naïvely
assumed
the
final
label
put
upon
the
finished
thought
most
people
asked
if
they
can
think
without
speech
would
probably
answer
yes
but
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
do
so
still
i
know
it
can
be
done
language
is
but
a
garment
but
what
if
language
is
not
so
much
a
garment
as
a
prepared
road
or
groove
it
is
indeed
in
the
highest
degree
likely
that
language
is
an
instrument
originally
put
to
uses
lower
than
the
conceptual
plane
and
that
thought
arises
as
a
refined
interpretation
of
its
content
the
product
grows
in
other
words
with
the
instrument
and
thought
may
be
no
more
conceivable
in
its
genesis
and
daily
practice
without
speech
than
is
mathematical
reasoning
practicable
without
the
lever
of
an
appropriate
mathematical
symbolism
no
one
believes
that
even
the
most
difficult
mathematical
proposition
is
inherently
dependent
on
an
arbitrary
set
of
symbols
but
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
the
human
mind
is
capable
of
arriving
at
or
holding
such
a
proposition
without
the
symbolism
the
writer
for
one
is
strongly
of
the
opinion
that
the
feeling
entertained
by
so
many
that
they
can
think
or
even
reason
without
language
is
an
illusion
the
illusion
seems
to
be
due
to
a
number
of
factors
the
simplest
of
these
is
the
failure
to
distinguish
between
imagery
and
thought
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
sooner
do
we
try
to
put
an
image
into
conscious
relation
with
another
than
we
find
ourselves
slipping
into
a
silent
flow
of
words
thought
may
be
a
natural
domain
apart
from
the
artificial
one
of
speech
but
speech
would
seem
to
be
the
only
road
we
know
of
that
leads
to
it
a
still
more
fruitful
source
of
the
illusive
feeling
that
language
may
be
dispensed
with
in
thought
is
the
common
failure
to
realize
that
language
is
not
identical
with
its
auditory
symbolism
the
auditory
symbolism
may
be
replaced
point
for
point
by
a
motor
or
by
a
visual
symbolism
many
people
can
read
for
instance
in
a
purely
visual
sense
that
is
without
the
intermediating
link
of
an
inner
flow
of
the
auditory
images
that
correspond
to
the
printed
or
written
words
or
by
still
other
more
subtle
and
elusive
types
of
transfer
that
are
not
so
easy
to
define
hence
the
contention
that
one
thinks
without
language
merely
because
he
is
not
aware
of
a
coexisting
auditory
imagery
is
very
far
indeed
from
being
a
valid
one
one
may
go
so
far
as
to
suspect
that
the
symbolic
expression
of
thought
may
in
some
cases
run
along
outside
the
fringe
of
the
conscious
mind
so
that
the
feeling
of
a
free
nonlinguistic
stream
of
thought
is
for
minds
of
a
certain
type
a
relatively
but
only
a
relatively
justified
one
this
would
mean
that
the
auditory
or
equivalent
visual
or
motor
centers
in
the
brain
together
with
the
appropriate
paths
of
association
that
are
the
cerebral
equivalent
of
speech
are
touched
off
so
lightly
during
the
process
of
thought
as
not
to
rise
into
consciousness
at
all
this
would
be
a
limiting
case
thought
riding
lightly
on
the
submerged
crests
of
speech
instead
of
jogging
along
with
it
hand
in
hand
the
modern
psychology
has
shown
us
how
powerfully
symbolism
is
at
work
in
the
unconscious
mind
it
is
therefore
easier
to
understand
at
the
present
time
than
it
would
have
been
twenty
years
ago
that
the
most
rarefied
thought
may
be
but
the
conscious
counterpart
of
an
unconscious
linguistic
symbolism
one
word
more
as
to
the
relation
between
language
and
thought
the
point
of
view
that
we
have
developed
does
not
by
any
means
preclude
the
possibility
of
the
growth
of
speech
being
in
a
high
degree
dependent
on
the
development
of
thought
we
may
assume
that
language
arose
just
how
and
on
what
precise
level
of
mental
activity
we
do
not
know
but
we
must
not
imagine
that
a
highly
developed
system
of
speech
symbols
worked
itself
out
before
the
genesis
of
distinct
concepts
and
of
thinking
the
handling
of
concepts
we
must
rather
imagine
that
thought
processes
set
in
as
a
kind
of
psychic
overflow
almost
at
the
beginning
of
linguistic
expression
further
that
the
concept
once
defined
necessarily
reacted
on
the
life
of
its
linguistic
symbol
encouraging
further
linguistic
growth
we
see
this
complex
process
of
the
interaction
of
language
and
thought
actually
taking
place
under
our
eyes
the
instrument
makes
possible
the
product
the
product
refines
the
instrument
the
birth
of
a
new
concept
is
invariably
foreshadowed
by
a
more
or
less
strained
or
extended
use
of
old
linguistic
material
the
concept
does
not
attain
to
individual
and
independent
life
until
it
has
found
a
distinctive
linguistic
embodiment
in
most
cases
the
new
symbol
is
but
a
thing
wrought
from
linguistic
material
already
in
existence
in
ways
mapped
out
by
crushingly
despotic
precedents
as
soon
as
the
word
is
at
hand
we
instinctively
feel
with
something
of
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
concept
is
ours
for
the
handling
not
until
we
own
the
symbol
do
we
feel
that
we
hold
a
key
to
the
immediate
knowledge
or
understanding
of
the
concept
would
we
be
so
ready
to
die
for
liberty
to
struggle
for
ideals
if
the
words
themselves
were
not
ringing
within
us
and
the
word
as
we
know
is
not
only
a
key
it
may
also
be
a
fetter
language
is
primarily
an
auditory
system
of
symbols
in
so
far
as
it
is
articulated
it
is
also
a
motor
system
but
the
motor
aspect
of
speech
is
clearly
secondary
to
the
auditory
in
normal
individuals
the
impulse
to
speech
first
takes
effect
in
the
sphere
of
auditory
imagery
and
is
then
transmitted
to
the
motor
nerves
that
control
the
organs
of
speech
the
motor
processes
and
the
accompanying
motor
feelings
are
not
however
the
end
the
final
resting
point
they
are
merely
a
means
and
a
control
leading
to
auditory
perception
in
both
speaker
and
hearer
communication
which
is
the
very
object
of
speech
is
successfully
effected
only
when
the
hearer
auditory
perceptions
are
translated
into
the
appropriate
and
intended
flow
of
imagery
or
thought
or
both
combined
hence
the
cycle
of
speech
in
so
far
as
we
may
look
upon
it
as
a
purely
external
instrument
begins
and
ends
in
the
realm
of
sounds
the
concordance
between
the
initial
auditory
imagery
and
the
final
auditory
perceptions
is
the
social
seal
or
warrant
of
the
successful
issue
of
the
process
as
we
have
already
seen
the
typical
course
of
this
process
may
undergo
endless
modifications
or
transfers
into
equivalent
systems
without
thereby
losing
its
essential
formal
characteristics
the
most
important
of
these
modifications
is
the
abbreviation
of
the
speech
process
involved
in
thinking
this
has
doubtless
many
forms
according
to
the
structural
or
functional
peculiarities
of
the
individual
mind
the
least
modified
form
is
that
known
as
talking
to
one
self
or
thinking
aloud
here
the
speaker
and
the
hearer
are
identified
in
a
single
person
who
may
be
said
to
communicate
with
himself
more
significant
is
the
still
further
abbreviated
form
in
which
the
sounds
of
speech
are
not
articulated
at
all
to
this
belong
all
the
varieties
of
silent
speech
and
of
normal
thinking
the
auditory
centers
alone
may
be
excited
or
the
impulse
to
linguistic
expression
may
be
communicated
as
well
to
the
motor
nerves
that
communicate
with
the
organs
of
speech
but
be
inhibited
either
in
the
muscles
of
these
organs
or
at
some
point
in
the
motor
nerves
themselves
or
possibly
the
auditory
centers
may
be
only
slightly
if
at
all
affected
the
speech
process
manifesting
itself
directly
in
the
motor
sphere
there
must
be
still
other
types
of
abbreviation
how
common
is
the
excitation
of
the
motor
nerves
in
silent
speech
in
which
no
audible
or
visible
articulations
result
is
shown
by
the
frequent
experience
of
fatigue
in
the
speech
organs
particularly
in
the
larynx
after
unusually
stimulating
reading
or
intensive
thinking
all
the
modifications
so
far
considered
are
directly
patterned
on
the
typical
process
of
normal
speech
of
very
great
interest
and
importance
is
the
possibility
of
transferring
the
whole
system
of
speech
symbolism
into
other
terms
than
those
that
are
involved
in
the
typical
process
this
process
as
we
have
seen
is
a
matter
of
sounds
and
of
movements
intended
to
produce
these
sounds
the
sense
of
vision
is
not
brought
into
play
but
let
us
suppose
that
one
not
only
hears
the
articulated
sounds
but
sees
the
articulations
themselves
as
they
are
being
executed
by
the
speaker
clearly
if
one
can
only
gain
a
sufficiently
high
degree
of
adroitness
in
perceiving
these
movements
of
the
speech
organs
the
way
is
opened
for
a
new
type
of
speech
symbolism
that
in
which
the
sound
is
replaced
by
the
visual
image
of
the
articulations
that
correspond
to
the
sound
this
sort
of
system
has
no
great
value
for
most
of
us
because
we
are
already
possessed
of
the
system
of
which
it
is
at
best
but
an
imperfect
translation
not
all
the
articulations
being
visible
to
the
eye
however
it
is
well
known
what
excellent
use
can
make
of
reading
from
the
lips
as
a
subsidiary
method
of
apprehending
speech
the
most
important
of
all
visual
speech
symbolisms
is
of
course
that
of
the
written
or
printed
word
to
which
on
the
motor
side
corresponds
the
system
of
delicately
adjusted
movements
which
result
in
the
writing
or
typewriting
or
other
graphic
method
of
recording
speech
the
significant
feature
for
our
recognition
in
these
new
types
of
symbolism
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
are
no
longer
a
of
normal
speech
itself
is
that
each
element
letter
or
written
word
in
the
system
corresponds
to
a
specific
element
sound
or
or
spoken
word
in
the
primary
system
written
language
is
thus
a
equivalence
to
borrow
a
mathematical
phrase
to
its
spoken
counterpart
the
written
forms
are
secondary
symbols
of
the
spoken
ones
symbols
of
symbols
yet
so
close
is
the
correspondence
that
they
may
not
only
in
theory
but
in
the
actual
practice
of
certain
and
possibly
in
certain
types
of
thinking
be
entirely
substituted
for
the
spoken
ones
yet
the
associations
are
probably
always
latent
at
the
least
that
is
they
are
unconsciously
brought
into
play
even
those
who
read
and
think
without
the
slightest
use
of
sound
imagery
are
at
last
analysis
dependent
on
it
they
are
merely
handling
the
circulating
medium
the
money
of
visual
symbols
as
a
convenient
substitute
for
the
economic
goods
and
services
of
the
fundamental
auditory
symbols
the
possibilities
of
linguistic
transfer
are
practically
unlimited
a
familiar
example
is
the
morse
telegraph
code
in
which
the
letters
of
written
speech
are
represented
by
a
conventionally
fixed
sequence
of
longer
or
shorter
ticks
here
the
transfer
takes
place
from
the
written
word
rather
than
directly
from
the
sounds
of
spoken
speech
the
letter
of
the
telegraph
code
is
thus
a
symbol
of
a
symbol
of
a
symbol
it
does
not
of
course
in
the
least
follow
that
the
skilled
operator
in
order
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
a
telegraphic
message
needs
to
transpose
the
individual
sequence
of
ticks
into
a
visual
image
of
the
word
before
he
experiences
its
normal
auditory
image
the
precise
method
of
reading
off
speech
from
the
telegraphic
communication
undoubtedly
varies
widely
with
the
individual
it
is
even
conceivable
if
not
exactly
likely
that
certain
operators
may
have
learned
to
think
directly
so
far
as
the
purely
conscious
part
of
the
process
of
thought
is
concerned
in
terms
of
the
symbolism
or
if
they
happen
to
have
a
strong
natural
bent
toward
motor
symbolism
in
terms
of
the
correlated
symbolism
developed
in
the
sending
of
telegraphic
messages
still
another
interesting
group
of
transfers
are
the
different
gesture
languages
developed
for
the
use
of
of
trappist
monks
vowed
to
perpetual
silence
or
of
communicating
parties
that
are
within
seeing
distance
of
each
other
but
are
out
of
earshot
some
of
these
systems
are
equivalences
of
the
normal
system
of
speech
others
like
military
or
the
gesture
language
of
the
plains
indians
of
north
america
understood
by
tribes
of
mutually
unintelligible
forms
of
speech
are
imperfect
transfers
limiting
themselves
to
the
rendering
of
such
grosser
speech
elements
as
are
an
imperative
minimum
under
difficult
circumstances
in
these
latter
systems
as
in
such
still
more
imperfect
symbolisms
as
those
used
at
sea
or
in
the
woods
it
may
be
contended
that
language
no
longer
properly
plays
a
part
but
that
the
ideas
are
directly
conveyed
by
an
utterly
unrelated
symbolic
process
or
by
a
imitativeness
such
an
interpretation
would
be
erroneous
the
intelligibility
of
these
vaguer
symbolisms
can
hardly
be
due
to
anything
but
their
automatic
and
silent
translation
into
the
terms
of
a
fuller
flow
of
speech
we
shall
no
doubt
conclude
that
all
voluntary
communication
of
ideas
aside
from
normal
speech
is
either
a
transfer
direct
or
indirect
from
the
typical
symbolism
of
language
as
spoken
and
heard
or
at
the
least
involves
the
intermediary
of
truly
linguistic
symbolism
this
is
a
fact
of
the
highest
importance
auditory
imagery
and
the
correlated
motor
imagery
leading
to
articulation
are
by
whatever
devious
ways
we
follow
the
process
the
historic
of
all
speech
and
of
all
thinking
one
other
point
is
of
still
greater
importance
the
ease
with
which
speech
symbolism
can
be
transferred
from
one
sense
to
another
from
technique
to
technique
itself
indicates
that
the
mere
sounds
of
speech
are
not
the
essential
fact
of
language
which
lies
rather
in
the
classification
in
the
formal
patterning
and
in
the
relating
of
concepts
once
more
language
as
a
structure
is
on
its
inner
face
the
mold
of
thought
it
is
this
abstracted
language
rather
more
than
the
physical
facts
of
speech
that
is
to
concern
us
in
our
inquiry
there
is
no
more
striking
general
fact
about
language
than
its
universality
one
may
argue
as
to
whether
a
particular
tribe
engages
in
activities
that
are
worthy
of
the
name
of
religion
or
of
art
but
we
know
of
no
people
that
is
not
possessed
of
a
fully
developed
language
the
lowliest
south
african
bushman
speaks
in
the
forms
of
a
rich
symbolic
system
that
is
in
essence
perfectly
comparable
to
the
speech
of
the
cultivated
frenchman
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
more
abstract
concepts
are
not
nearly
so
plentifully
represented
in
the
language
of
the
savage
nor
is
there
the
rich
terminology
and
the
finer
definition
of
nuances
that
reflect
the
higher
culture
yet
the
sort
of
linguistic
development
that
parallels
the
historic
growth
of
culture
and
which
in
its
later
stages
we
associate
with
literature
is
at
best
but
a
superficial
thing
the
fundamental
groundwork
of
language
the
development
of
a
phonetic
system
the
specific
association
of
speech
elements
with
concepts
and
the
delicate
provision
for
the
formal
expression
of
all
manner
of
relations
all
this
meets
us
rigidly
perfected
and
systematized
in
every
language
known
to
us
many
primitive
languages
have
a
formal
richness
a
latent
luxuriance
of
expression
that
eclipses
anything
known
to
the
languages
of
modern
civilization
even
in
the
mere
matter
of
the
inventory
of
speech
the
layman
must
be
prepared
for
strange
surprises
popular
statements
as
to
the
extreme
poverty
of
expression
to
which
primitive
languages
are
doomed
are
simply
myths
scarcely
less
impressive
than
the
universality
of
speech
is
its
almost
incredible
diversity
those
of
us
that
have
studied
french
or
german
or
better
yet
latin
or
greek
know
in
what
varied
forms
a
thought
may
run
the
formal
divergences
between
the
english
plan
and
the
latin
plan
however
are
comparatively
slight
in
the
perspective
of
what
we
know
of
more
exotic
linguistic
patterns
the
universality
and
the
diversity
of
speech
lead
to
a
significant
inference
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
language
is
an
immensely
ancient
heritage
of
the
human
race
whether
or
not
all
forms
of
speech
are
the
historical
outgrowth
of
a
single
pristine
form
it
is
doubtful
if
any
other
cultural
asset
of
man
be
it
the
art
of
drilling
for
fire
or
of
chipping
stone
may
lay
claim
to
a
greater
age
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
antedated
even
the
lowliest
developments
of
material
culture
that
these
developments
in
fact
were
not
strictly
possible
until
language
the
tool
of
significant
expression
had
itself
taken
shape
ii
the
elements
of
speech
we
have
more
than
once
referred
to
the
elements
of
speech
by
which
we
understood
roughly
speaking
what
are
ordinarily
called
words
we
must
now
look
more
closely
at
these
elements
and
acquaint
ourselves
with
the
stuff
of
language
the
very
simplest
element
of
speech
and
by
speech
we
shall
mean
the
auditory
system
of
speech
symbolism
the
flow
of
spoken
words
is
the
individual
sound
though
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
sound
is
not
itself
a
simple
structure
but
the
resultant
of
a
series
of
independent
yet
closely
correlated
adjustments
in
the
organs
of
speech
and
yet
the
individual
sound
is
not
properly
considered
an
element
of
speech
at
all
for
speech
is
a
significant
function
and
the
sound
as
such
has
no
significance
it
happens
occasionally
that
the
single
sound
is
an
independently
significant
element
such
as
french
has
and
to
or
latin
go
but
such
cases
are
fortuitous
coincidences
between
individual
sound
and
significant
word
the
coincidence
is
apt
to
be
fortuitous
not
only
in
theory
but
in
point
of
actual
historic
fact
thus
the
instances
cited
are
merely
reduced
forms
of
originally
fuller
phonetic
groups
latin
and
and
respectively
if
language
is
a
structure
and
if
the
significant
elements
of
language
are
the
bricks
of
the
structure
then
the
sounds
of
speech
can
only
be
compared
to
the
unformed
and
unburnt
clay
of
which
the
bricks
are
fashioned
in
this
chapter
we
shall
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
sounds
as
sounds
the
true
significant
elements
of
language
are
generally
sequences
of
sounds
that
are
either
words
significant
parts
of
words
or
word
groupings
what
distinguishes
each
of
these
elements
is
that
it
is
the
outward
sign
of
a
specific
idea
whether
of
a
single
concept
or
image
or
of
a
number
of
such
concepts
or
images
definitely
connected
into
a
whole
the
single
word
may
or
may
not
be
the
simplest
significant
element
we
have
to
deal
with
the
english
words
each
conveys
a
perfectly
definite
and
intelligible
idea
though
the
idea
is
disconnected
and
is
therefore
functionally
of
no
practical
value
we
recognize
immediately
that
these
words
are
of
two
sorts
the
first
word
is
an
indivisible
phonetic
entity
conveying
the
notion
of
a
certain
specific
activity
the
other
words
all
involve
the
same
fundamental
notion
but
owing
to
the
addition
of
other
phonetic
elements
this
notion
is
given
a
particular
twist
that
modifies
or
more
closely
defines
it
they
represent
in
a
sense
compounded
concepts
that
have
flowered
from
the
fundamental
one
we
may
therefore
analyze
the
words
and
as
binary
expressions
involving
a
fundamental
concept
a
concept
of
subject
matter
and
a
further
concept
of
more
abstract
order
one
of
person
number
time
condition
function
or
of
several
of
these
combined
if
we
symbolize
such
a
term
as
by
the
algebraic
formula
a
we
shall
have
to
symbolize
such
terms
as
and
by
the
formula
a
b
the
element
a
may
be
either
a
complete
and
independent
word
or
the
fundamental
substance
the
root
or
stem
or
radical
element
of
a
word
the
element
b
is
the
indicator
of
a
subsidiary
and
as
a
rule
a
more
abstract
concept
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
form
it
puts
upon
the
fundamental
concept
a
formal
limitation
we
may
term
it
a
grammatical
element
or
affix
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
grammatical
element
or
the
grammatical
increment
as
we
had
better
put
it
need
not
be
suffixed
to
the
radical
element
it
may
be
a
prefixed
element
like
the
of
it
may
be
inserted
into
the
very
body
of
the
stem
like
the
of
the
latin
i
conquer
as
contrasted
with
its
absence
in
i
have
conquered
it
may
be
the
complete
or
partial
repetition
of
the
stem
or
it
may
consist
of
some
modification
of
the
inner
form
of
the
stem
change
of
vowel
as
in
and
change
of
consonant
as
in
and
change
of
accent
actual
abbreviation
each
and
every
one
of
these
types
of
grammatical
element
or
modification
has
this
peculiarity
that
it
may
not
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
be
used
independently
but
needs
to
be
somehow
attached
to
or
welded
with
a
radical
element
in
order
to
convey
an
intelligible
notion
we
had
better
therefore
modify
our
formula
a
b
to
a
b
the
round
brackets
symbolizing
the
incapacity
of
an
element
to
stand
alone
the
grammatical
element
moreover
is
not
only
except
as
associated
with
a
radical
one
it
does
not
even
as
a
rule
obtain
its
measure
of
significance
unless
it
is
associated
with
a
particular
class
of
radical
elements
thus
the
of
english
symbolizes
an
utterly
different
notion
from
the
of
merely
because
and
are
differently
classified
as
to
function
we
must
hasten
to
observe
however
that
while
the
radical
element
may
on
occasion
be
identical
with
the
word
it
does
not
follow
that
it
may
always
or
even
customarily
be
used
as
a
word
thus
the
garden
of
such
latin
forms
as
and
is
as
much
of
an
abstraction
though
one
yielding
a
more
easily
apprehended
significance
than
the
of
neither
exists
as
an
independently
intelligible
and
satisfying
element
of
speech
both
the
radical
element
as
such
and
the
grammatical
element
therefore
are
reached
only
by
a
process
of
abstraction
it
seemed
proper
to
symbolize
as
a
b
must
be
symbolized
as
a

footnote
we
shall
reserve

footnote
these
words
are
not
here
used
in
a
narrowly
technical
sense
so
far
the
first
speech
element
that
we
have
found
which
we
can
say
actually
exists
is
the
word
before
defining
the
word
however
we
must
look
a
little
more
closely
at
the
type
of
word
that
is
illustrated
by
are
we
after
all
justified
in
identifying
it
with
a
radical
element
does
it
represent
a
simple
correspondence
between
concept
and
linguistic
expression
is
the
element
that
we
have
abstracted
from
and
and
to
which
we
may
justly
ascribe
a
general
unmodified
conceptual
value
actually
the
same
linguistic
fact
as
the
word
it
would
almost
seem
absurd
to
doubt
it
yet
a
little
reflection
only
is
needed
to
convince
us
that
the
doubt
is
entirely
legitimate
the
word
can
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
freely
used
to
refer
to
its
own
conceptual
content
the
existence
of
such
evidently
related
forms
as
and
at
once
shows
that
it
can
not
refer
to
past
time
but
that
for
at
least
an
important
part
of
its
range
of
usage
it
is
limited
to
the
present
on
the
other
hand
the
use
of
as
an
infinitive
in
such
locutions
as
and
will
does
indicate
that
there
is
a
fairly
strong
tendency
for
the
word
to
represent
the
full
untrammeled
amplitude
of
a
specific
concept
yet
if
were
in
any
adequate
sense
the
fixed
expression
of
the
unmodified
concept
there
should
be
no
room
for
such
vocalic
aberrations
as
we
find
in
and
and
nor
should
we
find
specifically
used
to
indicate
present
time
for
all
persons
but
one
third
person
singular
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
is
a
kind
of
twilight
word
trembling
between
the
status
of
a
true
radical
element
and
that
of
a
modified
word
of
the
type
of
though
it
has
no
outward
sign
to
indicate
that
it
conveys
more
than
a
generalized
idea
we
do
feel
that
there
hangs
about
it
a
variable
mist
of
added
value
the
formula
a
does
not
seem
to
represent
it
so
well
as
a
we
might
suspect
of
belonging
to
the
a
b
type
with
the
reservation
that
the
b
had
vanished
this
report
of
the
feel
of
the
word
is
far
from
fanciful
for
historical
evidence
does
in
all
earnest
show
that
is
in
origin
a
number
of
quite
distinct
words
of
type
a
b
that
have
pooled
their
separate
values
the
b
of
each
of
these
has
gone
as
a
tangible
phonetic
element
its
force
however
lingers
on
in
weakened
measure
the
of
is
the
correspondent
of
the
the
infinitive
of
the
imperative
of
ever
since
the
breakdown
of
english
forms
that
set
in
about
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
our
language
has
been
straining
towards
the
creation
of
simple
unalloyed
by
formal
connotations
but
it
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
this
apart
possibly
from
isolated
adverbs
and
other
elements
of
that
sort
were
the
typical
unanalyzable
word
of
the
language
truly
a
pure
type

instead
of
being
of
a
strangely
transitional
type
type
a
our
and
and
and
thousands
of
others
would
compare
with
the
genuine
of
numerous
other
languages
such
a
to
take
a
random
example
is
the
nootka
word
bone
our
english
correspondent
is
only
superficially
comparable
means
bone
in
a
quite
indefinite
sense
to
our
english
word
clings
the
notion
of
singularity
the
nootka

convey
the
idea
of
plurality

one
of
several
ways
if
he
so
desires
but
he
does
not
need
to
may
do
for
either
singular
or
plural
should
no
interest
happen
to
attach
to
the
distinction
as
soon
as
we
say
bone
aside
from
its
secondary
usage
to
indicate
material
we
not
merely
specify
the
nature
of
the
object
but
we
imply
whether
we
will
or
no
that
there
is
but
one
of
these
objects
to
be
considered
and
this
increment
of
value
makes
all
the
difference

spoken
by

now
know
of
four
distinct
formal
types

there
is
but
one
other
type
that
is
fundamentally
possible
a
b
the
union
of
two
or
more
independently
occurring
radical
elements
into
a
single
term
such
a
word
is
the
compound

a
sioux
form
equivalent
to

while
standing
it
frequently
happens
however
that
one
of
the
radical
elements
becomes
functionally
so
subordinated
to
the
other
that
it
takes
on
the
character
of
a
grammatical
element
we
may
symbolize
this
by
a
b
a
type
that
may
gradually
by
loss
of
external
connection
between
the
subordinated

independent

is
clearly
of
the
type
a

no
one

a
linguistic
student
is
aware
of
the
connection
between
the
and
the
independent

actual
use

course
these
five
or
six
fundamental
types
may
be
indefinitely
complicated
in
a
number
of
ways
the
may
have
a
multiple
value
in
other
words
the
inherent
formal
modification
of
the
basic
notion
of
the
word
may
affect
more
than
one
category
in
such
a
latin
word
as
heart
for
instance
not
only
is
a
concrete
concept
conveyed
but
there
cling
to
the
form
which
is
actually
shorter
than
its
own
radical

three
distinct

intertwined
formal
concepts

the
merely
external

abstracted

the
minus
sign
a
loss

the
significant
thing
about
such
a
word
as
is
that
the
three
conceptual
limitations
are
not
merely
expressed
by
implication
as
the
word
sinks
into
place
in
a
sentence
they
are
tied
up
for
good
and
all
within
the
very
vitals
of
the
word
and
can
not
be
eliminated
by
any
possibility
of
usage
other
complications
result
from
a
manifolding
of
parts
in
a
given
word
there
may
be
several
elements
of
the
order

we
have
already
symbolized
this
by
the
type
a

of
the
order
a
of
the
order
b
and

finally
the
various
types
may
be
combined
among
themselves
in
endless
ways
a
comparatively
simple
language

english
or
even
latin
illustrates
but
a
modest
proportion
of
these
theoretical
possibilities

if
we

our
examples
freely
from
the
vast
storehouse
of
language
from
languages
exotic
as
well
as
from
those
that
we
are
more
familiar
with
we
shall
find
that
there
is
hardly
a
possibility
that
is
not
realized

of
unusual
length

its
own

it

no
psychological
monster

all

grammatical
elements

convey
nothing
when
detached
the

to
imply
that
the
finished
word
conveys
in
addition
to
what
is
definitely
expressed
a
further
relational
idea
that
of
subjectivity
in
other
words
the
form
can
only
be
used
as
the
subject
of
a
sentence
not
in
an
objective
or
other
syntactic
relation
the
radical
element
a
to
cut
up
before
entering
into
combination
with
the
coördinate
element
b
to
sit
is
itself
compounded
with
two
nominal
elements

an
instrumentally
used
stem

may
be
freely
used
as
the
radical
element
of

absolute
noun
in
its
given
form

an
objectively
used
group
e

black
cow

this
group
in
turn
consists
of
an
adjectival
radical
element
e
black
which
can
not
be
independently
employed
the
absolute
notion
of
black
can
be
rendered
only
as
the
participle
of
a
verb

the
compound
noun
c

the
radical
element

properly
means
buffalo
but
the
element
d
properly
an
independently
occurring
noun
meaning
horse
originally
dog

domesticated
animal

general
is
regularly
used
as
a
element
indicating
that
the
animal
denoted
by
the
stem
to

affixed
is
owned
by
a
human
being
it
will
be
observed
that
the

functionally
no
more
than
a
verbal
base

the
of

verbal

the
addition

temporal
element

the
way

not
be
understood

to
the
whole
basic
complex

a
unit

transform

verbal
expression

a
formally
noun
footnote
in
this
and
other
examples
taken
from
exotic
languages
i
am
forced
by
practical
considerations
to
simplify
the
actual
phonetic
forms
this
should
not
matter
perceptibly
as
we
are
concerned
with
form
as
such
not
with
phonetic
content
it
is
high
time
that
we
decided
just
what
is
meant
by
a
word
our
first
impulse
no
doubt
would
have
been
to
define
the
word
as
the
symbolic
linguistic
counterpart
of
a
single
concept
we
now
know
that
such
a
definition
is
impossible
in
truth
it
is
impossible
to
define
the
word
from
a
functional
standpoint
at
all
for
the
word
may
be
anything
from
the
expression
of
a
single
concept
concrete
or
abstract
or
purely
relational
as
in
or
or
to
the
expression
of
a
complete
thought
as
in
latin
i
say
or
with
greater
elaborateness
of
form
in
a
nootka
verb
form
denoting
i
have
been
accustomed
to
eat
twenty
round
objects
apples
while
engaged
in
doing
so
and
so
in
the
latter
case
the
word
becomes
identical
with
the
sentence
the
word
is
merely
a
form
a
definitely
molded
entity
that
takes
in
as
much
or
as
little
of
the
conceptual
material
of
the
whole
thought
as
the
genius
of
the
language
cares
to
allow
thus
it
is
that
while
the
single
radical
elements
and
grammatical
elements
the
carriers
of
isolated
concepts
are
comparable
as
we
pass
from
language
to
language
the
finished
words
are
not
radical
or
grammatical
element
and
sentence
these
are
the
primary
units
of
speech
the
former
as
an
abstracted
minimum
the
latter
as
the
esthetically
satisfying
embodiment
of
a
unified
thought
the
actual
units
of
speech
the
words
may
on
occasion
identify
themselves
with
either
of
the
two
functional
units
more
often
they
mediate
between
the
two
extremes
embodying
one
or
more
radical
notions
and
also
one
or
more
subsidiary
ones
we
may
put
the
whole
matter
in
a
nutshell
by
saying
that
the
radical
and
grammatical
elements
of
language
abstracted
as
they
are
from
the
realities
of
speech
respond
to
the
conceptual
world
of
science
abstracted
as
it
is
from
the
realities
of
experience
and
that
the
word
the
existent
unit
of
living
speech
responds
to
the
unit
of
actually
apprehended
experience
of
history
of
art
the
sentence
is
the
logical
counterpart
of
the
complete
thought
only
if
it
be
felt
as
made
up
of
the
radical
and
grammatical
elements
that
lurk
in
the
recesses
of
its
words
it
is
the
psychological
counterpart
of
experience
of
art
when
it
is
felt
as
indeed
it
normally
is
as
the
finished
play
of
word
with
word
as
the
necessity
of
defining
thought
solely
and
exclusively
for
its
own
sake
becomes
more
urgent
the
word
becomes
increasingly
irrelevant
as
a
means
we
can
therefore
easily
understand
why
the
mathematician
and
the
symbolic
logician
are
driven
to
discard
the
word
and
to
build
up
their
thought
with
the
help
of
symbols
which
have
each
of
them
a
rigidly
unitary
value
but
is
not
the
word
one
may
object
as
much
of
an
abstraction
as
the
radical
element
is
it
not
as
arbitrarily
lifted
out
of
the
living
sentence
as
is
the
minimum
conceptual
element
out
of
the
word
some
students
of
language
have
indeed
looked
upon
the
word
as
such
an
abstraction
though
with
very
doubtful
warrant
it
seems
to
me
it
is
true
that
in
particular
cases
especially
in
some
of
the
highly
synthetic
languages
of
aboriginal
america
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
whether
a
particular
element
of
language
is
to
be
interpreted
as
an
independent
word
or
as
part
of
a
larger
word
these
transitional
cases
puzzling
as
they
may
be
on
occasion
do
not
however
materially
weaken
the
case
for
the
psychological
validity
of
the
word
linguistic
experience
both
as
expressed
in
standardized
written
form
and
as
tested
in
daily
usage
indicates
overwhelmingly
that
there
is
not
as
a
rule
the
slightest
difficulty
in
bringing
the
word
to
consciousness
as
a
psychological
reality
no
more
convincing
test
could
be
desired
than
this
that
the
naive
indian
quite
unaccustomed
to
the
concept
of
the
written
word
has
nevertheless
no
serious
difficulty
in
dictating
a
text
to
a
linguistic
student
word
by
word
he
tends
of
course
to
run
his
words
together
as
in
actual
speech
but
if
he
is
called
to
a
halt
and
is
made
to
understand
what
is
desired
he
can
readily
isolate
the
words
as
such
repeating
them
as
units
he
regularly
refuses
on
the
other
hand
to
isolate
the
radical
or
grammatical
element
on
the
ground
that
it
makes
no
sense
what
then
is
the
objective
criterion
of
the
word
the
speaker
and
hearer
feel
the
word
let
us
grant
but
how
shall
we
justify
their
feeling
if
function
is
not
the
ultimate
criterion
of
the
word
what
is
footnote
these
oral
experiences
which
i
have
had
time
and
again
as
a
field
student
of
american
indian
languages
are
very
neatly
confirmed
by
personal
experiences
of
another
sort
twice
i
have
taught
intelligent
young
indians
to
write
their
own
languages
according
to
the
phonetic
system
which
i
employ
they
were
taught
merely
how
to
render
accurately
the
sounds
as
such
both
had
some
difficulty
in
learning
to
break
up
a
word
into
its
constituent
sounds
but
none
whatever
in
determining
the
words
this
they
both
did
with
spontaneous
and
complete
accuracy
in
the
hundreds
of
pages
of
manuscript
nootka
text
that
i
have
obtained
from
one
of
these
young
indians
the
words
whether
abstract
relational
entities
like
english
and
or
complex
like
the
nootka
example
quoted
above
are
practically
without
exception
isolated
precisely
as
i
or
any
other
student
would
have
isolated
them
such
experiences
with
naïve
speakers
and
recorders
do
more
to
convince
one
of
the
definitely
plastic
unity
of
the
word
than
any
amount
of
purely
theoretical
argument
it
is
easier
to
ask
the
question
than
to
answer
it
the
best
that
we
can
do
is
to
say
that
the
word
is
one
of
the
smallest
completely
satisfying
bits
of
isolated
meaning
into
which
the
sentence
resolves
itself
it
can
not
be
cut
into
without
a
disturbance
of
meaning
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
the
severed
parts
remaining
as
a
helpless
waif
on
our
hands
in
practice
this
unpretentious
criterion
does
better
service
than
might
be
supposed
in
such
a
sentence
as
is
it
is
simply
impossible
to
group
the
elements
into
any
other
and
smaller
words
than
the
three
indicated
or
might
be
isolated
but
as
neither
nor
nor
yields
a
measurable
satisfaction
we
are
compelled
to
leave
as
an
integral
whole
a
miniature
bit
of
art
added
to
the
feel
of
the
word
are
frequently
but
by
no
means
invariably
certain
external
phonetic
characteristics
chief
of
these
is
accent
in
many
perhaps
in
most
languages
the
single
word
is
marked
by
a
unifying
accent
an
emphasis
on
one
of
the
syllables
to
which
the
rest
are
subordinated
the
particular
syllable
that
is
to
be
so
distinguished
is
dependent
needless
to
say
on
the
special
genius
of
the
language
the
importance
of
accent
as
a
unifying
feature
of
the
word
is
obvious
in
such
english
examples
as
the
long
paiute
word
that
we
have
analyzed
is
marked
as
a
rigid
phonetic
unit
by
several
features
chief
of
which
are
the
accent
on
its
second
syllable
knife
and
the
slurring
unvoicing
to
use
the
technical
phonetic
term
of
its
final
vowel
animate
plural
such
features
as
accent
cadence
and
the
treatment
of
consonants
and
vowels
within
the
body
of
a
word
are
often
useful
as
aids
in
the
external
demarcation
of
the
word
but
they
must
by
no
means
be
interpreted
as
is
sometimes
done
as
themselves
responsible
for
its
psychological
existence
they
at
best
but
strengthen
a
feeling
of
unity
that
is
already
present
on
other
grounds
we
have
already
seen
that
the
major
functional
unit
of
speech
the
sentence
has
like
the
word
a
psychological
as
well
as
a
merely
logical
or
abstracted
existence
its
definition
is
not
difficult
it
is
the
linguistic
expression
of
a
proposition
it
combines
a
subject
of
discourse
with
a
statement
in
regard
to
this
subject
subject
and
predicate
may
be
combined
in
a
single
word
as
in
latin
each
may
be
expressed
independently
as
in
the
english
equivalent
each
or
either
may
be
so
qualified
as
to
lead
to
complex
propositions
of
many
sorts
no
matter
how
many
of
these
qualifying
elements
words
or
functional
parts
of
words
are
introduced
the
sentence
does
not
lose
its
feeling
of
unity
so
long
as
each
and
every
one
of
them
falls
in
place
as
contributory
to
the
definition
of
either
the
subject
of
discourse
or
the
core
of
the
predicate
such
a
sentence
as
mayor
of
new
york
is
going
to
deliver
a
speech
of
welcome
in
is
readily
felt
as
a
unified
statement
incapable
of
reduction
by
the
transfer
of
certain
of
its
elements
in
their
given
form
to
the
preceding
or
following
sentences
the
contributory
ideas
of
new
and
may
be
eliminated
without
hurting
the
idiomatic
flow
of
the
sentence
mayor
is
going
to
deliver
a
is
a
perfectly
intelligible
proposition
but
further
than
this
we
can
not
go
in
the
process
of
reduction
we
can
not
say
for
instance
is
going
to
the
reduced
sentence
resolves
itself
into
the
subject
of
discourse
and
the
predicate
going
to
deliver
a
it
is
customary
to
say
that
the
true
subject
of
such
a
sentence
is
the
true
predicate
or
even
the
other
elements
being
strictly
subordinate
such
an
analysis
however
is
purely
schematic
and
is
without
psychological
value
it
is
much
better
frankly
to
recognize
the
fact
that
either
or
both
of
the
two
terms
of
the
may
be
incapable
of
expression
in
the
form
of
single
words
there
are
languages
that
can
convey
all
that
is
conveyed
by
in
two
words
a
subject
word
and
a
predicate
word
but
english
is
not
so
highly
synthetic
the
point
that
we
are
really
making
here
is
that
underlying
the
finished
sentence
is
a
living
sentence
type
of
fixed
formal
characteristics
these
fixed
types
or
actual
may
be
freely
overlaid
by
such
additional
matter
as
the
speaker
or
writer
cares
to
put
on
but
they
are
themselves
as
rigidly
given
by
tradition
as
are
the
radical
and
grammatical
elements
abstracted
from
the
finished
word
new
words
may
be
consciously
created
from
these
fundamental
elements
on
the
analogy
of
old
ones
but
hardly
new
types
of
words
in
the
same
way
new
sentences
are
being
constantly
created
but
always
on
strictly
traditional
lines
the
enlarged
sentence
however
allows
as
a
rule
of
considerable
freedom
in
the
handling
of
what
may
be
called
unessential
parts
it
is
this
margin
of
freedom
which
gives
us
the
opportunity
of
individual
style
footnote
coordinate
sentences
like
shall
remain
but
you
may
may
only
doubtfully
be
considered
as
truly
unified
predications
as
true
sentences
they
are
sentences
in
a
stylistic
sense
rather
than
from
the
strictly
formal
linguistic
standpoint
the
orthography
shall
remain
but
you
may
is
as
intrinsically
justified
as
shall
remain
now
you
may
the
closer
connection
in
sentiment
between
the
first
two
propositions
has
led
to
a
conventional
visual
representation
that
must
not
deceive
the
analytic
spirit
footnote
except
possibly
in
a
newspaper
headline
such
headlines
however
are
language
only
in
a
derived
sense
the
habitual
association
of
radical
elements
grammatical
elements
words
and
sentences
with
concepts
or
groups
of
concepts
related
into
wholes
is
the
fact
itself
of
language
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
is
in
all
languages
a
certain
randomness
of
association
thus
the
idea
of
hide
may
be
also
expressed
by
the
word
conceal
the
notion
of
three
times
also
by
thrice
the
multiple
expression
of
a
single
concept
is
universally
felt
as
a
source
of
linguistic
strength
and
variety
not
as
a
needless
extravagance
more
irksome
is
a
random
correspondence
between
idea
and
linguistic
expression
in
the
field
of
abstract
and
relational
concepts
particularly
when
the
concept
is
embodied
in
a
grammatical
element
thus
the
randomness
of
the
expression
of
plurality
in
such
words
as
and
is
felt
to
be
rather
more
i
fancy
an
unavoidable
and
traditional
predicament
than
a
welcome
luxuriance
it
is
obvious
that
a
language
can
not
go
beyond
a
certain
point
in
this
randomness
many
languages
go
incredibly
far
in
this
respect
it
is
true
but
linguistic
history
shows
conclusively
that
sooner
or
later
the
less
frequently
occurring
associations
are
ironed
out
at
the
expense
of
the
more
vital
ones
in
other
words
all
languages
have
an
inherent
tendency
to
economy
of
expression
were
this
tendency
entirely
inoperative
there
would
be
no
grammar
the
fact
of
grammar
a
universal
trait
of
language
is
simply
a
generalized
expression
of
the
feeling
that
analogous
concepts
and
relations
are
most
conveniently
symbolized
in
analogous
forms
were
a
language
ever
completely
grammatical
it
would
be
a
perfect
engine
of
conceptual
expression
unfortunately
or
luckily
no
language
is
tyrannically
consistent
all
grammars
leak
up
to
the
present
we
have
been
assuming
that
the
material
of
language
reflects
merely
the
world
of
concepts
and
on
what
i
have
ventured
to
call
the
plane
of
images
which
are
the
raw
material
of
concepts
we
have
in
other
words
been
assuming
that
language
moves
entirely
in
the
ideational
or
cognitive
sphere
it
is
time
that
we
amplified
the
picture
the
volitional
aspect
of
consciousness
also
is
to
some
extent
explicitly
provided
for
in
language
nearly
all
languages
have
special
means
for
the
expression
of
commands
in
the
imperative
forms
of
the
verb
for
example
and
of
desires
unattained
or
unattainable
he
might
come
or
he
were
here
the
emotions
on
the
whole
seem
to
be
given
a
less
adequate
outlet
emotion
indeed
is
proverbially
inclined
to
speechlessness
most
if
not
all
the
interjections
are
to
be
put
to
the
credit
of
emotional
expression
also
it
may
be
a
number
of
linguistic
elements
expressing
certain
modalities
such
as
dubitative
or
potential
forms
which
may
be
interpreted
as
reflecting
the
emotional
states
of
hesitation
or
doubt
attenuated
fear
on
the
whole
it
must
be
admitted
that
ideation
reigns
supreme
in
language
that
volition
and
emotion
come
in
as
distinctly
secondary
factors
this
after
all
is
perfectly
intelligible
the
world
of
image
and
concept
the
endless
and
picture
of
objective
reality
is
the
unavoidable
of
human
communication
for
it
is
only
or
mainly
in
terms
of
this
world
that
effective
action
is
possible
desire
purpose
emotion
are
the
personal
color
of
the
objective
world
they
are
applied
privately
by
the
individual
soul
and
are
of
relatively
little
importance
to
the
neighboring
one
all
this
does
not
mean
that
volition
and
emotion
are
not
expressed
they
are
strictly
speaking
never
absent
from
normal
speech
but
their
expression
is
not
of
a
truly
linguistic
nature
the
nuances
of
emphasis
tone
and
phrasing
the
varying
speed
and
continuity
of
utterance
the
accompanying
bodily
movements
all
these
express
something
of
the
inner
life
of
impulse
and
feeling
but
as
these
means
of
expression
are
at
last
analysis
but
modified
forms
of
the
instinctive
utterance
that
man
shares
with
the
lower
animals
they
can
not
be
considered
as
forming
part
of
the
essential
cultural
conception
of
language
however
much
they
may
be
inseparable
from
its
actual
life
and
this
instinctive
expression
of
volition
and
emotion
is
for
the
most
part
sufficient
often
more
than
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
communication
there
are
it
is
true
certain
writers
on
the
psychology
of
language
who
deny
its
prevailingly
cognitive
character
but
attempt
on
the
contrary
to
demonstrate
the
origin
of
most
linguistic
elements
within
the
domain
of
feeling
i
confess
that
i
am
utterly
unable
to
follow
them
what
there
is
of
truth
in
their
contentions
may
be
summed
up
it
seems
to
me
by
saying
that
most
words
like
practically
all
elements
of
consciousness
have
an
associated
a
mild
yet
none
the
less
real
and
at
times
insidiously
powerful
derivative
of
pleasure
or
pain
this
however
is
not
as
a
rule
an
inherent
value
in
the
word
itself
it
is
rather
a
sentimental
growth
on
the
word
true
body
on
its
conceptual
kernel
not
only
may
the
change
from
one
age
to
another
this
of
course
is
true
of
the
conceptual
content
as
well
but
it
varies
remarkably
from
individual
to
individual
according
to
the
personal
associations
of
each
varies
indeed
from
time
to
time
in
a
single
individual
consciousness
as
his
experiences
mold
him
and
his
moods
change

be
sure

many

and
above
the

they
are
exceedingly
variable

at
best
they
rarely

the
rigidity

the
sounds
of
language
we
have
seen
that
the
mere
phonetic
framework
of
speech
does
not
constitute
the
inner
fact
of
language
and
that
the
single
sound
of
articulated
speech
is
not
as
such
a
linguistic
element
at
all
for
all
that
speech
is
so
inevitably
bound
up
with
sounds
and
their
articulation
that
we
can
hardly
avoid
giving
the
subject
of
phonetics
some
general
consideration
experience
has
shown
that
neither

purely
formal
aspects
of
a
language
nor
the
course
of
its
history
can
be
fully
understood
without
reference
to
the
sounds
in
which
this
form
and
this
history
are
embodied
a
detailed
survey
of
phonetics
would
be
both
too
technical
for
the
general
reader
and
too
loosely
related
to
our
main
theme
to
warrant
the
needed
space
but
we
can
well
afford
to
consider
a
few
outstanding
facts
and
ideas
connected
with
the
sounds
of
language
the
feeling
that
the
average
speaker
has
of
his
language
is
that
it
is
built
up
acoustically
speaking
of
a
comparatively
small
number
of
distinct
sounds
each
of
which
is
rather
accurately
provided
for
in
the
current
alphabet
by
one
letter
or
in
a
few
cases
by
two
or
more
alternative
letters
as
for
the
languages
of
foreigners
he
generally
feels
that
aside
from
a
few
striking
differences
that
can
not
escape
even
the
uncritical
ear
the
sounds
they
use
are
the
same
as
those
he
is
familiar
with
but
that
there
is
a
mysterious
accent
to
these
foreign
languages
a
certain
unanalyzed
phonetic
character
apart
from
the
sounds
as
such
that
gives
them
their
air
of
strangeness
this
naïve
feeling
is
largely
illusory
on
both
scores
phonetic
analysis
convinces
one
that
the
number
of
clearly
distinguishable
sounds
and
nuances
of
sounds
that
are
habitually
employed
by
the
speakers
of
a
language
is
far
greater
than
they
themselves
recognize
probably
not
one
english
speaker
out
of
a
hundred
has
the
remotest
idea
that
the
of
a
word
like
is
not
at
all
the
same
sound
as
the
of
the
latter
having
a
fullness
of
breath
release
that
is
inhibited
in
the
former
case
by
the
preceding
that
the
of
is
of
perceptibly
shorter
duration
than
the
of
or
that
the
final
of
a
word
like
is
not
the
full
buzzing
sound
of
the
in
such
a
word
as
it
is
the
frequent
failure
of
foreigners
who
have
acquired
a
practical
mastery
of
english
and
who
have
eliminated
all
the
cruder
phonetic
shortcomings
of
their
less
careful
brethren
to
observe
such
minor
distinctions
that
helps
to
give
their
english
pronunciation
the
curiously
elusive
accent
that
we
all
vaguely
feel
we
do
not
diagnose
the
accent
as
the
total
acoustic
effect
produced
by
a
series
of
slight
but
specific
phonetic
errors
for
the
very
good
reason
that
we
have
never
made
clear
to
ourselves
our
own
phonetic
stock
in
trade
if
two
languages
taken
at
random
say
english
and
russian
are
compared
as
to
their
phonetic
systems
we
are
more
apt
than
not
to
find
that
very
few
of
the
phonetic
elements
of
the
one
find
an
exact
analogue
in
the
other
thus
the
of
a
russian
word
like
there
is
neither
the
english
of
nor
the
english
of
it
differs
from
both
in
its
dental
articulation
in
other
words
in
being
produced
by
contact
of
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
the
upper
teeth
not
as
in
english
by
contact
of
the
tongue
back
of
the
tip
with
the
gum
ridge
above
the
teeth
moreover
it
differs
from
the
of
also
in
the
absence
of
a
marked
breath
release
before
the
following
vowel
is
attached
so
that
its
acoustic
effect
is
of
a
more
precise
metallic
nature
than
in
english
again
the
english
is
unknown
in
russian
which
possesses
on
the
other
hand
two
distinct
that
the
normal
english
speaker
would
find
it
difficult
exactly
to
reproduce
a
hollow
and
a
soft
palatalized
that
is
only
very
approximately
rendered
in
english
terms
as
even
so
simple
and
one
would
imagine
so
invariable
a
sound
as
differs
in
the
two
languages
in
a
russian
word
like
bridge
the
is
not
the
same
as
the
of
the
english
word
the
lips
are
more
fully
rounded
during
its
articulation
so
that
it
makes
a
heavier
more
resonant
impression
on
the
ear
the
vowels
needless
to
say
differ
completely
in
english
and
russian
hardly
any
two
of
them
being
quite
the
same
i
have
gone
into
these
illustrative
details
which
are
of
little
or
no
specific
interest
for
us
merely
in
order
to
provide
something
of
an
experimental
basis
to
convince
ourselves
of
the
tremendous
variability
of
speech
sounds
yet
a
complete
inventory
of
the
acoustic
resources
of
all
the
european
languages
the
languages
nearer
home
while
unexpectedly
large
would
still
fall
far
short
of
conveying
a
just
idea
of
the
true
range
of
human
articulation
in
many
of
the
languages
of
asia
africa
and
aboriginal
america
there
are
whole
classes
of
sounds
that
most
of
us
have
no
knowledge
of
they
are
not
necessarily
more
difficult
of
enunciation
than
sounds
more
familiar
to
our
ears
they
merely
involve
such
muscular
adjustments
of
the
organs
of
speech
as
we
have
never
habituated
ourselves
to
it
may
be
safely
said
that
the
total
number
of
possible
sounds
is
greatly
in
excess
of
those
actually
in
use
indeed
an
experienced
phonetician
should
have
no
difficulty
in
inventing
sounds
that
are
unknown
to
objective
investigation
one
reason
why
we
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
range
of
possible
speech
sounds
is
indefinitely
large
is
our
habit
of
conceiving
the
sound
as
a
simple
unanalyzable
impression
instead
of
as
the
resultant
of
a
number
of
distinct
muscular
adjustments
that
take
place
simultaneously
a
slight
change
in
any
one
of
these
adjustments
gives
us
a
new
sound
which
is
akin
to
the
old
one
because
of
the
continuance
of
the
other
adjustments
but
which
is
acoustically
distinct
from
it
so
sensitive
has
the
human
ear
become
to
the
nuanced
play
of
the
vocal
mechanism
another
reason
for
our
lack
of
phonetic
imagination
is
the
fact
that
while
our
ear
is
delicately
responsive
to
the
sounds
of
speech
the
muscles
of
our
speech
organs
have
early
in
life
become
exclusively
accustomed
to
the
particular
adjustments
and
systems
of
adjustment
that
are
required
to
produce
the
traditional
sounds
of
the
language
all
or
nearly
all
other
adjustments
have
become
permanently
inhibited
whether
through
inexperience
or
through
gradual
elimination
of
course
the
power
to
produce
these
inhibited
adjustments
is
not
entirely
lost
but
the
extreme
difficulty
we
experience
in
learning
the
new
sounds
of
foreign
languages
is
sufficient
evidence
of
the
strange
rigidity
that
has
set
in
for
most
people
in
the
voluntary
control
of
the
speech
organs
the
point
may
be
brought
home
by
contrasting
the
comparative
lack
of
freedom
of
voluntary
speech
movements
with
the
all
but
perfect
freedom
of
voluntary
gesture
our
rigidity
in
articulation
is
the
price
we
have
had
to
pay
for
easy
mastery
of
a
highly
necessary
symbolism
one
can
not
be
both
splendidly
free
in
the
random
choice
of
movements
and
selective
with
deadly
certainty
footnote
observe
the
voluntary
when
we
shout
or
grunt
or
otherwise
allow
our
voices
to
take
care
of
themselves
as
we
are
likely
to
do
when
alone
in
the
country
on
a
fine
spring
day
we
are
no
longer
fixing
vocal
adjustments
by
voluntary
control
under
these
circumstances
we
are
almost
certain
to
hit
on
speech
sounds
that
we
could
never
learn
to
control
in
actual
speech
footnote
if
speech
in
its
acoustic
and
articulatory
aspect
is
indeed
a
rigid
system
how
comes
it
one
may
plausibly
object
that
no
two
people
speak
alike
the
answer
is
simple
all
that
part
of
speech
which
falls
out
of
the
rigid
articulatory
framework
is
not
speech
in
idea
but
is
merely
a
superadded
more
or
less
instinctively
determined
vocal
complication
inseparable
from
speech
in
practice
all
the
individual
color
of
speech
personal
emphasis
speed
personal
cadence
personal
pitch
is
a
fact
just
as
the
incidental
expression
of
desire
and
emotion
are
for
the
most
part
alien
to
linguistic
expression
speech
like
all
elements
of
culture
demands
conceptual
selection
inhibition
of
the
randomness
of
instinctive
behavior
that
its
idea
is
never
realized
as
such
in
practice
its
carriers
being
instinctively
animated
organisms
is
of
course
true
of
each
and
every
aspect
of
culture
there
are
then
an
indefinitely
large
number
of
articulated
sounds
available
for
the
mechanics
of
speech
any
given
language
makes
use
of
an
explicit
rigidly
economical
selection
of
these
rich
resources
and
each
of
the
many
possible
sounds
of
speech
is
conditioned
by
a
number
of
independent
muscular
adjustments
that
work
together
simultaneously
towards
its
production
a
full
account
of
the
activity
of
each
of
the
organs
of
speech
in
so
far
as
its
activity
has
a
bearing
on
language
is
impossible
here
nor
can
we
concern
ourselves
in
a
systematic
way
with
the
classification
of
sounds
on
the
basis
of
their
mechanics
a
few
bold
outlines
are
all
that
we
can
attempt
the
organs
of
speech
are
the
lungs
and
bronchial
tubes
the
throat
particularly
that
part
of
it
which
is
known
as
the
larynx
or
in
popular
parlance
the
adam
apple
the
nose
the
uvula
which
is
the
soft
pointed
and
easily
movable
organ
that
depends
from
the
rear
of
the
palate
the
palate
which
is
divided
into
a
posterior
movable
soft
palate
or
velum
and
a
hard
palate
the
tongue
the
teeth
and
the
lips
the
palate
lower
palate
tongue
teeth
and
lips
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
combined
resonance
chamber
whose
constantly
varying
shape
chiefly
due
to
the
extreme
mobility
of
the
tongue
is
the
main
factor
in
giving
the
outgoing
breath
its
precise
quality
of
sound
footnote
purely
acoustic
classifications
such
as
more
easily
suggest
themselves
to
a
first
attempt
at
analysis
are
now
in
less
favor
among
students
of
phonetics
than
organic
classifications
the
latter
have
the
advantage
of
being
more
objective
moreover
the
acoustic
quality
of
a
sound
is
dependent
on
the
articulation
even
though
in
linguistic
consciousness
this
quality
is
the
primary
not
the
secondary
fact
footnote
by
quality
is
here
meant
the
inherent
nature
and
resonance
of
the
sound
as
such
the
general
quality
of
the
individual
voice
is
another
matter
altogether
this
is
chiefly
determined
by
the
individual
anatomical
characteristics
of
the
larynx
and
is
of
no
linguistic
interest
whatever
the
lungs
and
bronchial
tubes
are
organs
of
speech
only
in
so
far
as
they
supply
and
conduct
the
current
of
outgoing
air
without
which
audible
articulation
is
impossible
they
are
not
responsible
for
any
specific
sound
or
acoustic
feature
of
sounds
except
possibly
accent
or
stress
it
may
be
that
differences
of
stress
are
due
to
slight
differences
in
the
contracting
force
of
the
lung
muscles
but
even
this
influence
of
the
lungs
is
denied
by
some
students
who
explain
the
fluctuations
of
stress
that
do
so
much
to
color
speech
by
reference
to
the
more
delicate
activity
of
the
glottal
cords
these
glottal
cords
are
two
small
nearly
horizontal
and
highly
sensitive
membranes
within
the
larynx
which
consists
for
the
most
part
of
two
large
and
several
smaller
cartilages
and
of
a
number
of
small
muscles
that
control
the
action
of
the
cords
the
cords
which
are
attached
to
the
cartilages
are
to
the
human
speech
organs
what
the
two
vibrating
reeds
are
to
a
clarinet
or
the
strings
to
a
violin
they
are
capable
of
at
least
three
distinct
types
of
movement
each
of
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
speech
they
may
be
drawn
towards
or
away
from
each
other
they
may
vibrate
like
reeds
or
strings
and
they
may
become
lax
or
tense
in
the
direction
of
their
length
the
last
class
of
these
movements
allows
the
cords
to
vibrate
at
different
lengths
or
degrees
of
tenseness
and
is
responsible
for
the
variations
in
pitch
which
are
present
not
only
in
song
but
in
the
more
elusive
modulations
of
ordinary
speech
the
two
other
types
of
glottal
action
determine
the
nature
of
the
voice
voice
being
a
convenient
term
for
breath
as
utilized
in
speech
if
the
cords
are
well
apart
allowing
the
breath
to
escape
in
unmodified
form
we
have
the
condition
technically
known
as
voicelessness
all
sounds
produced
under
these
circumstances
are
voiceless
sounds
such
are
the
simple
unmodified
breath
as
it
passes
into
the
mouth
which
is
at
least
approximately
the
same
as
the
sound
that
we
write
also
a
large
number
of
special
articulations
in
the
mouth
chamber
like
and
on
the
other
hand
the
glottal
cords
may
be
brought
tight
together
without
vibrating
when
this
happens
the
current
of
breath
is
checked
for
the
time

the
slight
choke
or
arrested
cough
that
is
thus
made
audible
is
not
recognized
in
english
as
a
definite
sound
but
occurs
nevertheless
not
infrequently
this
momentary
check
technically
known
as
a
glottal
stop
is
an
integral
element
of
speech
in
many
languages
as
danish
lettish
certain
chinese
dialects
and
nearly
all
american
indian
languages
between
the
two
extremes
of
voicelessness
that
of
completely
open
breath
and
that
of
checked
breath
lies
the
position
of
true
voice

a
musical
tone

tone

an
indefinite

the
breath
voiced
or
unvoiced
nasalized
or
unnasalized
may
be
allowed
to
pass
through
the
mouth
without
being
checked
or
impeded
at
any
point
or
it
may
be
either
momentarily
checked
or
allowed
to
stream
through
a
greatly
narrowed
passage
with
resulting
air
friction
there
are
also
transitions
between
the
two
latter
types
of
articulation
the
unimpeded
breath
takes
on
a
particular
color
or
quality
in
accordance
with
the
varying
shape
of
the
oral
resonance
chamber
this
shape
is
chiefly
determined
by
the
position
of
the
movable
parts
the
tongue
and
the
lips
as
the
tongue
is
raised
or
lowered
retracted
or
brought
forward
held
tense
or
lax
and
as
the
lips
are
pursed
rounded
in
varying
degree
or
allowed
to
keep
their
position
of
rest
a
large
number
of
distinct
qualities
result
these
oral
qualities
are
the
vowels
in
theory
their
number
is
infinite
in
practice
the
ear
can
differentiate
only
a
limited
yet
a
surprisingly
large
number
of
resonance
positions
vowels
whether
nasalized
or
not
are
normally
voiced
sounds
in
not
a
few
languages
however
voiceless
vowels
also
occur

these
may
be
also
defined
as
free
unvoiced

varying

timbres

the
remaining
oral
sounds
are
generally
grouped
together
as
consonants
in
them
the
stream
of
breath
is
interfered
with
in
some
way
so
that
a
lesser
resonance
results
and
a
sharper
more
incisive
quality
of
tone
there
are
four
main
types
of
articulation
generally
recognized
within
the
consonantal
group
of
sounds
the
breath
may
be
completely
stopped
for
a
moment
at
some
definite
point
in
the
oral
cavity
sounds
so
produced
like
or
or
are
known
as
stops
or
explosives
or
the
breath
may
be
continuously
obstructed
through
a
narrow
passage
not
entirely
checked
examples
of
such
spirants
or
fricatives
as
they
are
called

and
and
the
third
class
of
consonants
the
laterals
are
there
is
a
true
stoppage
at
the
central
point
of
articulation
but
the
breath
is
allowed
to
escape
through
the
two
side
passages
or
through
one
of
them
our
english
for
instance
may
be
readily
transformed
into
which
has
the
voicing
and
the
position
of
merely
by
depressing
the
sides
of
the
tongue
on
either
side
of
the
point
of
contact
sufficiently
to
allow
the
breath
to
come
through
laterals
are
possible
in
many
distinct
positions
they
may
be
unvoiced
the
welsh
is
an
example
as
well
as
voiced
finally
the
stoppage
of
the
breath
may
be
rapidly
intermittent
in
other
words
the
active
organ
of
contact
generally
the
point
of
the
tongue
less
often
the
uvula
may
be
made
to
vibrate
against
or
near
the
point
of
contact
these
sounds
are
the
trills
or
rolled
consonants
of
which
the
normal
english
is
a
none
too
typical
example
they
are
well
developed
in
many
languages
however
generally
in
voiced
form
sometimes
as
in
welsh
and
paiute
in
unvoiced
form
as
well
footnote
nasalized
stops
say
or
can
naturally
not
be
truly
stopped
as
there
is
no
way
of
checking
the
stream
of
breath
in
the
nose
by
a
definite
articulation
footnote
the
lips
also
may
theoretically
so
articulate
labial
trills
however
are
certainly
rare
in
natural
speech
the
oral
manner
of
articulation
is
naturally
not
sufficient
to
define
a
consonant
the
place
of
articulation
must
also
be
considered
contacts
may
be
formed
at
a
large
number
of
points
from
the
root
of
the
tongue
to
the
lips
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
go
at
length
into
this
somewhat
complicated
matter
the
contact
is
either
between
the
root
of
the
tongue
and
the
throat
some
part
of
the
tongue
and
a
point
on
the
palate
as
in
or
or
some
part
of
the
tongue
and
the
teeth
as
in
the
english
of
and
the
teeth
and
one
of
the
lips
practically
always
the
upper
teeth
and
lower
lip
as
in
or
the
two
lips
as
in
or
english
the
tongue
articulations
are
the
most
complicated
of
all
as
the
mobility
of
the
tongue
allows
various
points
on
its
surface
say
the
tip
to
articulate
against
a
number
of
opposed
points
of
contact
hence
arise
many
positions
of
articulation
that
we
are
not
familiar
with
such
as
the
typical
dental
position
of
russian
or
italian
and
or
the
cerebral
position
of
sanskrit
and
other
languages
of
india
in
which
the
tip
of
the
tongue
articulates
against
the
hard
palate
as
there
is
no
break
at
any
point
between
the
rims
of
the
teeth
back
to
the
uvula
nor
from
the
tip
of
the
tongue
back
to
its
root
it
is
evident
that
all
the
articulations
that
involve
the
tongue
form
a
continuous
organic
and
acoustic
series
the
positions
grade
into
each
other
but
each
language
selects
a
limited
number
of
clearly
defined
positions
as
characteristic
of
its
consonantal
system
ignoring
transitional
or
extreme
positions
frequently
a
language
allows
a
certain
latitude
in
the
fixing
of
the
required
position
this
is
true
for
instance
of
the
english
sound
which
is
articulated
much
further
to
the
front
in
a
word
like
than
in
we
ignore
this
difference
psychologically
as
a
mechanical
one
another
language
might
well
recognize
the
difference
or
only
a
slightly
greater
one
as
significant
as
paralleling
the
distinction
in
position
between
the
of
and
the
of
footnote
this
position
known
as
faucal
is
not
common
the
organic
classification
of
speech
sounds
is
a
simple
matter
after
what
we
have
learned
of
their
production
any
such
sound
may
be
put
into
its
proper
place
by
the
appropriate
answer
to
four
main
questions
what
is
the
position
of
the
glottal
cords
during
its
articulation
does
the
breath
pass
into
the
mouth
alone
or
is
it
also
allowed
to
stream
into
the
nose
does
the
breath
pass
freely
through
the
mouth
or
is
it
impeded
at
some
point
and
if
so
in
what
manner
what
are
the
precise
points
of
articulation
in
the
mouth
this
fourfold
classification
of
sounds
worked
out
in
all
its
detailed
ramifications
is
sufficient
to
account
for
all
or
practically
all
the
sounds
of
language
footnote
points
of
articulation
must
be
understood
to
include
tongue
and
lip
positions
of
the
vowels
footnote
including
under
the
fourth
category
a
number
of
special
resonance
adjustments
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
take
up
specifically
footnote
in
so
far
it
should
be
added
as
these
sounds
are
expiratory
pronounced
with
the
outgoing
breath
certain
languages
like
the
south
african
hottentot
and
bushman
have
also
a
number
of
inspiratory
sounds
pronounced
by
sucking
in
the
breath
at
various
points
of
oral
contact
these
are
the
clicks
the
phonetic
habits
of
a
given
language
are
not
exhaustively
defined
by
stating
that
it
makes
use
of
such
and
such
particular
sounds
out
of
the
all
but
endless
gamut
that
we
have
briefly
surveyed
there
remains
the
important
question
of
the
dynamics
of
these
phonetic
elements
two
languages
may
theoretically
be
built
up
of
precisely
the
same
series
of
consonants
and
vowels
and
yet
produce
utterly
different
acoustic
effects
one
of
them
may
not
recognize
striking
variations
in
the
lengths
or
quantities
of
the
phonetic
elements
the
other
may
note
such
variations
most
punctiliously
in
probably
the
majority
of
languages
long
and
short
vowels
are
distinguished
in
many
as
in
italian
or
swedish
or
ojibwa
long
consonants
are
recognized
as
distinct
from
short
ones
or
the
one
say
english
may
be
very
sensitive
to
relative
stresses
while
in
the
other
say
french
stress
is
a
very
minor
consideration
or
again
the
pitch
differences
which
are
inseparable
from
the
actual
practice
of
language
may
not
affect
the
word
as
such
but
as
in
english
may
be
a
more
or
less
random
or
at
best
but
a
rhetorical
phenomenon
while
in
other
languages
as
in
swedish
lithuanian
chinese
siamese
and
the
majority
of
african
languages
they
may
be
more
finely
graduated
and
felt
as
integral
characteristics
of
the
words
themselves
varying
methods
of
syllabifying
are
also
responsible
for
noteworthy
acoustic
differences
most
important
of
all
perhaps
are
the
very
different
possibilities
of
combining
the
phonetic
elements
each
language
has
its
peculiarities
the
combination
for
instance
is
found
in
both
english
and
german
but
in
english
it
can
only
occur
at
the
end
of
a
word
as
in
while
it
occurs
freely
in
german
as
the
psychological
equivalent
of
a
single
sound
as
in
some
languages
allow
of
great
heapings
of
consonants
or
of
vocalic
groups
diphthongs
in
others
no
two
consonants
or
no
two
vowels
may
ever
come
together
frequently
a
sound
occurs
only
in
a
special
position
or
under
special
phonetic
circumstances
in
english
for
instance
the
of
can
not
occur
initially
while
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
of
is
dependent
on
its
being
preceded
by
the
these
dynamic
factors
in
their
totality
are
as
important
for
the
proper
understanding
of
the
phonetic
genius
of
a
language
as
the
sound
system
itself
often
far
more
so
we
have
already
seen
in
an
incidental
way
that
phonetic
elements
or
such
dynamic
features
as
quantity
and
stress
have
varying
psychological
values
the
english
of
is
merely
a
followed
by
a
functionally
independent
the
of
the
german
word
has
an
integral
value
equivalent
say
to
the
of
the
english
word
again
the
of
is
indeed
noticeably
distinct
from
that
of
but
the
difference
to
the
consciousness
of
an
person
is
quite
irrelevant
it
has
no
value
if
we
compare
the
of
haida
the
indian
language
spoken
in
the
queen
charlotte
islands
we
find
that
precisely
the
same
difference
of
articulation
has
a
real
value
in
such
a
word
as
two
the
is
pronounced
precisely
as
in
english
but
in
from
the
is
clearly
aspirated
like
that
of
in
other
words
an
objective
difference
that
is
irrelevant
in
english
is
of
functional
value
in
haida
from
its
own
psychological
standpoint
the
of
is
as
different
from
that
of
as
from
our
standpoint
is
the
of
from
the
of
further
investigation
would
yield
the
interesting
result
that
the
haida
ear
finds
the
difference
between
the
english
of
and
the
of
as
irrelevant
as
the
naïve
english
ear
finds
that
of
the
of
and
the
objective
comparison
of
sounds
in
two
or
more
languages
is
then
of
no
psychological
or
historical
significance
unless
these
sounds
are
first
weighted
unless
their
phonetic
values
are
determined
these
values
in
turn
flow
from
the
general
behavior
and
functioning
of
the
sounds
in
actual
speech
these
considerations
as
to
phonetic
value
lead
to
an
important
conception
back
of
the
purely
objective
system
of
sounds
that
is
peculiar
to
a
language
and
which
can
be
arrived
at
only
by
a
painstaking
phonetic
analysis
there
is
a
more
restricted
inner
or
ideal
system
which
while
perhaps
equally
unconscious
as
a
system
to
the
naïve
speaker
can
far
more
readily
than
the
other
be
brought
to
his
consciousness
as
a
finished
pattern
a
psychological
mechanism
the
inner
overlaid
though
it
may
be
by
the
mechanical
or
the
irrelevant
is
a
real
and
an
immensely
important
principle
in
the
life
of
a
language
it
may
persist
as
a
pattern
involving
number
relation
and
functioning
of
phonetic
elements
long
after
its
phonetic
content
is
changed
two
historically
related
languages
or
dialects
may
not
have
a
sound
in
common
but
their
ideal
may
be
identical
patterns
i
would
not
for
a
moment
wish
to
imply
that
this
pattern
may
not
change
it
may
shrink
or
expand
or
change
its
functional
complexion
but
its
rate
of
change
is
infinitely
less
rapid
than
that
of
the
sounds
as
such
every
language
then
is
characterized
as
much
by
its
ideal
system
of
sounds
and
by
the
underlying
phonetic
pattern
system
one
might
term
it
of
symbolic
atoms
as
by
a
definite
grammatical
structure
both
the
phonetic
and
conceptual
structures
show
the
instinctive
feeling
of
language
for
form
footnote
the
conception
of
the
ideal
phonetic
system
the
phonetic
pattern
of
a
language
is
not
as
well
understood
by
linguistic
students
as
it
should
be
in
this
respect
the
unschooled
recorder
of
language
provided
he
has
a
good
ear
and
a
genuine
instinct
for
language
is
often
at
a
great
advantage
as
compared
with
the
minute
phonetician
who
is
apt
to
be
swamped
by
his
mass
of
observations
i
have
already
employed
my
experience
in
teaching
indians
to
write
their
own
language
for
its
testing
value
in
another
connection
it
yields
equally
valuable
evidence
here
i
found
that
it
was
difficult
or
impossible
to
teach
an
indian
to
make
phonetic
distinctions
that
did
not
correspond
to
points
in
the
pattern
of
his
language
however
these
differences
might
strike
our
objective
ear
but
that
subtle
barely
audible
phonetic
differences
if
only
they
hit
the
points
in
the
pattern
were
easily
and
voluntarily
expressed
in
writing
in
watching
my
nootka
interpreter
write
his
language
i
often
had
the
curious
feeling
that
he
was
transcribing
an
ideal
flow
of
phonetic
elements
which
he
heard
inadequately
from
a
purely
objective
standpoint
as
the
intention
of
the
actual
rumble
of
speech
iv
form
in
language
grammatical
processes
the
question
of
form
in
language
presents
itself
under
two
aspects
we
may
either
consider
the
formal
methods
employed
by
a
language
its
grammatical
processes
or
we
may
ascertain
the
distribution
of
concepts
with
reference
to
formal
expression
what
are
the
formal
patterns
of
the
language
and
what
types
of
concepts
make
up
the
content
of
these
formal
patterns
the
two
points
of
view
are
quite
distinct
the
english
word
is
broadly
speaking
formally
parallel
to
the
word
each
being
built
up
on
a
radical
element
which
may
occur
as
an
independent
verb
this
radical
element
being
preceded
by
an
element
that
conveys
a
definite
and
fairly
concrete
significance
but
that
can
not
be
used
independently
and
followed
by
two
elements
that
limit
the
application
of
the
radical
concept
in
a
relational
sense
this
formal
pattern
b
a
c
d
is
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
language
a
countless
number
of
functions
may
be
expressed
by
it
in
other
words
all
the
possible
ideas
conveyed
by
such
prefixed
and
suffixed
elements
while
tending
to
fall
into
minor
groups
do
not
necessarily
form
natural
functional
systems
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
instance
why
the
numeral
function
of
should
be
formally
expressed
in
a
manner
that
is
analogous
to
the
expression
of
the
idea
conveyed
by
it
is
perfectly
conceivable
that
in
another
language
the
concept
of
manner
may
be
treated
according
to
an
entirely
different
pattern
from
that
of
plurality
the
former
might
have
to
be
expressed
by
an
independent
word
say
the
latter
by
a
prefixed
element
say
there
are
of
course
an
unlimited
number
of
other
possibilities
even
within
the
confines
of
english
alone
the
relative
independence
of
form
and
function
can
be
made
obvious
thus
the
negative
idea
conveyed
by
can
be
just
as
adequately
expressed
by
a
suffixed
element
in
such
a
word
as
such
a
twofold
formal
expression
of
the
negative
function
would
be
inconceivable
in
certain
languages
say
eskimo
where
a
suffixed
element
would
alone
be
possible
again
the
plural
notion
conveyed
by
the
of
is
just
as
definitely
expressed
in
the
word
where
an
utterly
distinct
method
is
employed
furthermore
the
principle
of
vocalic
change
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
expression
of
the
idea
of
plurality
it
may
also
function
as
an
indicator
of
difference
of
time
but
the
expression
in
english
of
past
time
is
not
by
any
means
always
bound
up
with
a
change
of
vowel
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
same
idea
is
expressed
by
means
of
a
distinct
suffix
functionally
and
are
analogous
so
are
and
formally
we
must
arrange
these
words
quite
otherwise
both
and
employ
the
method
of
suffixing
grammatical
elements
both
and
have
grammatical
form
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
their
vowels
differ
from
the
vowels
of
other
words
with
which
they
are
closely
related
in
form
and
meaning

symbolism

main
concept
of
the
radical
element
some
of
these
grammatical
processes
like
suffixing
are
exceedingly
others
like
vocalic
change
are
less
common
but
far
from
rare
still
others
like
accent
and
consonantal
change
are
somewhat
exceptional
as
functional
processes
not
all
languages
are
as
irregular
as
english
in
the
assignment
of
functions
to
its
stock
of
grammatical
processes
as
a
rule
such
basic
concepts
as
those
of
plurality
and
time
are
rendered
by
means
of
one
or
other
method
alone
but
the
rule
has
so
many
exceptions
that
we
can
not
safely
lay
it
down
as
a
principle
wherever
we
go
we
are
impressed
by
the
fact
that
pattern
is
one
thing
the
utilization
of
pattern
quite
another
a
few
further
examples
of
the
multiple
expression
of
identical
functions
in
other
languages
than
english
may
help
to
make
still
more
vivid
this
idea
of
the
relative
independence
of
form
and
function
in
hebrew
as
in
other
semitic
languages
the
verbal
idea
as
such
is
expressed
by
three
less
often
by
two
or
four
characteristic
consonants
thus
the
group
expresses
the
idea
of
guarding
the
group
that
of
stealing
that
of
giving
naturally
these
consonantal
sequences
are
merely
abstracted
from
the
actual
forms
the
consonants
are
held
together
in
different
forms
by
characteristic
vowels
that
vary
according
to
the
idea
that
it
is
desired
to
express
prefixed
and
suffixed
elements
are
also
frequently
used
the
method
of
internal
vocalic
change
is
exemplified
in
he
has
guarded
guarding
being
guarded
to
guard
analogously
he
has
stolen
stealing
being
stolen
to
steal
but
not
all
infinitives
are
formed
according
to
the
type
of
and
or
of
other
types
of
internal
vowel
change
certain
verbs

the

the
pronominal

may
be
expressed
by

words

plurals
are
formed
by
four
distinct
methods
most
nouns
and
verbs
are
reduplicated
in
the
plural
that
is
part
of
the
radical
element
is
repeated

a
second
method
is
the
use
of
certain
characteristic
prefixes
hand

are
formed
by

a

class
of

constituted
by
such
nouns
as
suffix
a
grammatical
element
brother
brothers
from
such
groups
of
examples
as
these
and
they
might
be
multiplied
we
can
not
but
conclude
that
linguistic
form
may
and
should
be
studied
as
types
of
patterning
apart
from
the
associated
functions
we
are
the
more
justified
in
this
procedure
as
all
languages
evince
a
curious
instinct
for
the
development
of
one
or
more
particular
grammatical
processes
at
the
expense
of
others
tending
always
to
lose
sight
of
any
explicit
functional
value
that
the
process
may
have
had
in
the
first
instance
delighting
it
would
seem
in
the
sheer
play
of
its
means
of
expression
it
does
not
matter
that
in
such
a
case
as
the
english
we
can
prove
that
we
are
dealing
with
historically
distinct
processes
that
the
vocalic
alternation
of
and
for
instance
is
centuries
older
as
a
specific
type
of
grammatical
process
than
the
outwardly
parallel
one
of
and
it
remains
true
that
there
is
or
was
an
inherent
tendency
in
english
at
the
time
such
forms
as
came
into
being
for
the
utilization
of
vocalic
change
as
a
significant
linguistic
method
failing
the
precedent
set
by
such
already
existing
types
of
vocalic
alternation
as
it
is
highly
doubtful
if
the
detailed
conditions
that
brought
about
the
evolution
of
forms
like
and
from
and
would
have
been
potent
enough
to
allow
the
native
linguistic
feeling
to
win
through
to
an
acceptance
of
these
new
types
of
plural
formation
as
psychologically
possible
this
feeling
for
form
as
such
freely
expanding
along
predetermined
lines
and
greatly
inhibited
in
certain
directions
by
the
lack
of
controlling
types
of
patterning
should
be
more
clearly
understood
than
it
seems
to
be
a
general
survey
of
many
diverse
types
of
languages
is
needed
to
give
us
the
proper
perspective
on
this
point
we
saw
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
every
language
has
an
inner
phonetic
system
of
definite
pattern
we
now
learn
that
it
has
also
a
definite
feeling
for
patterning
on
the
level
of
grammatical
formation
both
of
these
submerged
and
powerfully
controlling
impulses
to
definite
form
operate
as
such
regardless
of
the
need
for
expressing
particular
concepts
or
of
giving
consistent
external
shape
to
particular
groups
of
concepts
it
goes
without
saying
that
these
impulses
can
find
realization
only
in
concrete
functional
expression
we
must
say
something
to
be
able
to
say
it
in
a
certain
manner
let
us
now
take
up
a
little
more
systematically
however
briefly
the
various
grammatical
processes
that
linguistic
research
has
established
they
may
be
grouped
into
six
main
types
word
order
composition
affixation
including
the
use
of
prefixes
suffixes
and
infixes
internal
modification
of
the
radical
or
grammatical
element
whether
this
affects
a
vowel
or
a
consonant
reduplication
and
accentual
differences
whether
dynamic
stress
or
tonal
pitch
there
are
also
special
quantitative
processes
like
vocalic
lengthening
or
shortening
and
consonantal
doubling
but
these
may
be
looked
upon
as
particular
of
the
process
of
internal
modification
possibly
still
other
formal
types
exist
but
they
are
not
likely
to
be
of
importance
in
a
general
survey
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
a
linguistic
phenomenon
can
not
be
looked
upon
as
illustrating
a
definite
process
unless
it
has
an
inherent
functional
value
the
consonantal
change
in
english
for
instance
of
and
in
the
former
in
the
latter
is
of
no
functional
significance
it
is
a
purely
external
mechanical
change
induced
by
the
presence
of
a
preceding
voiceless
consonant
in
the
former
case
of
a
voiced
consonant
in
the
latter
this
mechanical
alternation
is
objectively
the
same
as
that
between
the
noun
and
the
verb
in
the
latter
case
however
it
has
an
important
grammatical
function
that
of
transforming
a
noun
into
a
verb
the
two
alternations
belong
then
to
entirely
different
psychological
categories
only
the
latter
is
a
true
illustration
of
consonantal
modification
as
a
grammatical
process
the
simplest
at
least
the
most
economical
method
of
conveying
some
sort
of
grammatical
notion
is
to
juxtapose
two
or
more
words
in
a
definite
sequence
without
making
any
attempt
by
inherent
modification
of
these
words
to
establish
a
connection
between
them
let
us
put
down
two
simple
english
words
at
random
say
this
conveys
no
finished
thought
in
english
nor
does
it
clearly
establish
a
relation
between
the
idea
of
singing
and
that
of
praising
nevertheless
it
is
psychologically
impossible
to
hear
or
see
the
two
words
juxtaposed
without
straining
to
give
them
some
measure
of
coherent
significance
the
attempt
is
not
likely
to
yield
an
entirely
satisfactory
result
but
what
is
significant
is
that
as
soon
as
two
or
more
radical
concepts
are
put
before
the
human
mind
in
immediate
sequence
it
strives
to
bind
them
together
with
connecting
values
of
some
sort
in
the
case
of
different
individuals
are
likely
to
arrive
at
different
provisional
results
some
of
the
latent
possibilities
of
the
juxtaposition
expressed
in
currently
satisfying
form
are
praise
to
him
or
praise
praise
expressed
in
a
or
sing
and
or
who
sings
a
song
of
compare
such
english
compounds
as
who
kills
or
sings
a
song
of
praise
to
him
the
theoretical
possibilities
in
the
way
of
rounding
out
these
two
concepts
into
a
significant
group
of
concepts
or
even
into
a
finished
thought
are
indefinitely
numerous
none
of
them
will
quite
work
in
english
but
there
are
numerous
languages
where
one
or
other
of
these
amplifying
processes
is
habitual
it
depends
entirely
on
the
genius
of
the
particular
language
what
function
is
inherently
involved
in
a
given
sequence
of
words
some
languages
like
latin
express
practically
all
relations
by
means
of
modifications
within
the
body
of
the
word
itself
in
these
sequence
is
apt
to
be
a
rhetorical
rather
than
a
strictly
grammatical
principle
whether
i
say
in
latin
femina
or
hominem
or
videt
or
femina
makes
little
or
no
difference
beyond
possibly
a
rhetorical
or
stylistic
one
woman
sees
the
is
the
identical
significance
of
each
of
these
sentences
in
chinook
an
indian
language
of
the
columbia
river
one
can
be
equally
free
for
the
relation
between
the
verb
and
the
two
nouns
is
as
inherently
fixed
as
in
latin
the
difference
between
the
two
languages
is
that
while
latin
allows
the
nouns
to
establish
their
relation
to
each
other
and
to
the
verb
chinook
lays
the
formal
burden
entirely
on
the
verb
the
full
content
of
which
is
more
or
less
adequately
rendered
by
eliminate
the
latin
case
suffixes
and
and
the
chinook
pronominal
prefixes
and
we
can
not
afford
to
be
so
indifferent
to
our
word
order
we
need
to
husband
our
resources
in
other
words
word
order
takes
on
a
real
functional
value
latin
and
chinook
are
at
one
extreme
such
languages
as
chinese
siamese
and
annamite
in
which
each
and
every
word
if
it
is
to
function
properly
falls
into
its
assigned
place
are
at
the
other
extreme
but
the
majority
of
languages
fall
between
these
two
extremes
in
english
for
instance
it
may
make
little
grammatical
difference
whether
i
say
the
man
saw
the
or
man
saw
the
dog
but
it
is
not
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
i
say
the
man
saw
the
or
the
dog
saw
the
or
whether
i
say
is
or
he
here
in
the
one
case
of
the
latter
group
of
examples
the
vital
distinction
of
subject
and
object
depends
entirely
on
the
placing
of
certain
words
of
the
sentence
in
the
latter
a
slight
difference
of
sequence
makes
all
the
difference
between
statement
and
question
it
goes
without
saying
that
in
these
cases
the
english
principle
of
word
order
is
as
potent
a
means
of
expression
as
is
the
latin
use
of
case
suffixes
or
of
an
interrogative
particle
there
is
here
no
question
of
functional
poverty
but
of
formal
economy
we
have
already
seen
something
of
the
process
of
composition
the
uniting
into
a
single
word
of
two
or
more
radical
elements
psychologically
this
process
is
closely
allied
to
that
of
word
order
in
so
far
as
the
relation
between
the
elements
is
implied
not
explicitly
stated
it
differs
from
the
mere
juxtaposition
of
words
in
the
sentence
in
that
the
compounded
elements
are
felt
as
constituting
but
parts
of
a
single
such
languages
as
chinese
and
english
in
which
the
principle
of
rigid
sequence
is
well
developed
tend
not
infrequently
also
to
the
development
of
compound
words
it
is
but
a
step
from
such
a
chinese
word
sequence
as
man
virtue
the
virtue
of
men
to
such
more
conventionalized
and
psychologically
unified
juxtapositions
as
heaven
son
emperor
or
water
man
water
carrier
in
the
latter
case
we
may
as
well
frankly
write
as
a
single
word
the
meaning
of
the
compound
as
a
whole
being
as
divergent
from
the
precise
etymological
values
of
its
component
elements
as
is
that
of
our
english
word
from
the
merely
combined
values
of
and
in
english
the
unity
of
the
word
is
further
safeguarded
by
a
predominant
accent
on
the
first
syllable
and
by
the
possibility
of
adding
such
a
suffixed
element
as
the
plural
to
the
whole
word
chinese
also
unifies
its
compounds
by
means
of
stress
however
then
in
its
ultimate
origins
the
process
of
composition
may
go
back
to
typical
sequences
of
words
in
the
sentence
it
is
now
for
the
most
part
a
specialized
method
of
expressing
relations
french
has
as
rigid
a
word
order
as
english
but
does
not
possess
anything
like
its
power
of
compounding
words
into
more
complex
units
on
the
other
hand
classical
greek
in
spite
of
its
relative
freedom
in
the
placing
of
words
has
a
very
considerable
bent
for
the
formation
of
compound
terms
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
greatly
languages
differ
in
their
ability
to
make
use
of
the
process
of
composition
one
would
have
thought
on
general
principles
that
so
simple
a
device
as
gives
us
our
and
and
hosts
of
other
words
would
be
an
all
but
universal
grammatical
process
such
is
not
the
case
there
are
a
great
many
languages
like
eskimo
and
nootka
and
aside
from
paltry
exceptions
the
semitic
languages
that
can
not
compound
radical
elements
what
is
even
stranger
is
the
fact
that
many
of
these
languages
are
not
in
the
least
averse
to
complex
but
may
on
the
contrary
effect
a
synthesis
that
far
surpasses
the
utmost
that
greek
and
sanskrit
are
capable
of
such
a
nootka
word
for
instance
as
when
as
they
say
he
had
been
absent
for
four
days
might
be
expected
to
embody
at
least
three
radical
elements
corresponding
to
the
concepts
of
absent
four
and
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
nootka
word
is
utterly
incapable
of
composition
in
our
sense
it
is
invariably
built
up
out
of
a
single
radical
element
and
a
greater
or
less
number
of
suffixed
elements
some
of
which
may
have
as
concrete
a
significance
as
the
radical
element
itself
in
the
particular
case
we
have
cited
the
radical
element
conveys
the
idea
of
four
the
notions
of
day
and
absent
being
expressed
by
suffixes
that
are
as
inseparable
from
the
radical
nucleus
of
the
word
as
is
an
english
element
like
from
the
or
of
such
words
as
and
the
tendency
to
word
synthesis
is
then
by
no
means
the
same
thing
as
the
tendency
to
compounding
radical
elements
though
the
latter
is
not
infrequently
a
ready
means
for
the
synthetic
tendency
to
work
with
there
is
a
bewildering
variety
of
types
of
composition
these
types
vary
according
to
function
the
nature
of
the
compounded
elements
and
order
in
a
great
many
languages
composition
is
confined
to
what
we
may
call
the
delimiting
function
that
is
of
the
two
or
more
compounded
elements
one
is
given
a
more
precisely
qualified
significance
by
the
others
which
contribute
nothing
to
the
formal
build
of
the
sentence
in
english
for
instance
such
compounded
elements
as
in
or
in
merely
modify
the
significance
of
the
dominant
or
without
in
any
way
sharing
as
such
in
the
predication
that
is
expressed
by
the
sentence
some
languages
however
such
as
iroquois
and
nahuatl
employ
the
method
of
composition
for
much
heavier
work
than
this
in
iroquois
for
instance
the
composition
of
a
noun
in
its
radical
form
with
a
following
verb
is
a
typical
method
of
expressing
case
relations
particularly
of
the
subject
or
object
for
instance
is
the
regular
iroquois
method
of
expressing
the
sentence
am
eating
in
other
languages
similar
forms
may
express
local
or
instrumental
or
still
other
relations
such
english
forms
as
and
also
illustrate
the
compounding
of
a
verb
and
a
noun
but
the
resulting
word
has
a
strictly
nominal
not
a
verbal
function
we
can
not
say
some
languages
allow
the
composition
of
all
or
nearly
all
types
of
elements
paiute
for
instance
may
compound
noun
with
noun
adjective
with
noun
verb
with
noun
to
make
a
noun
noun
with
verb
to
make
a
verb
adverb
with

verb
with

yana
an
indian
language
of
california
can
freely
compound
noun
with
noun
and
verb
with
noun
but
not
verb
with
verb
on
the
other
hand
iroquois
can
compound
only
noun
with
verb
never
noun
and
noun
as
in
english
or
verb
and
verb
as
in
so
many
other
languages
finally
each
language
has
its
characteristic
types
of
order
of
composition
in
english
the
qualifying
element
regularly
precedes
in
certain
other
languages
it
follows
sometimes
both
types
are
used
in
the
same
language
as
in
yana
where
beef
is
but
is
expressed
by
the
compounded

chinese
and
siamese
that
make
no
grammatical
use
of
elements
that
do
not
at
the
same
time
possess
an
independent
value
as
radical
elements
but
such
languages
are
uncommon
of
the
three
types
of
affixing
the
use
of
prefixes
suffixes
and
infixes
suffixing
is
much
the
commonest
indeed
it
is
a
fair
guess
that
suffixes
do
more
of
the
formative
work
of
language
than
all
other
methods
combined
it
is
worth
noting
that
there
are
not
a
few
affixing
languages
that
make
absolutely
no
use
of
prefixed
elements
but
possess
a
complex
apparatus
of
suffixes
such
are
turkish
hottentot
eskimo
nootka
and
yana
some
of
these
like
the
three
last
mentioned
have
hundreds
of
suffixed
elements
many
of
them
of
a
concreteness
of
significance
that
would
demand
expression
in
the
vast
majority
of
languages
by
means
of
radical
elements
the
reverse
case
the
use
of
prefixed
elements
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
suffixes
is
far
less
common
a
good
example
is
khmer
or
cambodgian
spoken
in
french
though
even
here
there
are
obscure
traces
of
old
suffixes
that
have
ceased
to
function
as
such
and
are
now
felt
to
form
part
of
the
radical
element
a
considerable
majority
of
known
languages
are
prefixing
and
suffixing
at
one
and
the
same
time
but
the
relative
importance
of
the
two
groups
of
affixed
elements
naturally
varies
enormously
in
some
languages
such
as
latin
and
russian
the
suffixes
alone
relate
the
word
to
the
rest
of
the
sentence
the
prefixes
being
confined
to
the
expression
of
such
ideas
as
delimit
the
concrete
significance
of
the
radical
element
without
influencing
its
bearing
in
the
proposition
a
latin
form
like
they
were
being
sent
back
may
serve
as
an
illustration
of
this
type
of
distribution
of
elements
the
prefixed
element
back
merely
qualifies
to
a
certain
extent
the
inherent
significance
of
the
radical
element
send
while
the
suffixes
and
convey
the
less
concrete
more
strictly
formal
notions
of
time
person
plurality
and
passivity
on
the
other
hand
there
are
languages
like
the
bantu
group
of
africa
or
the
athabaskan
languages
of
north
america
in
which
the
grammatically
significant
elements
precede
those
that
follow
the
radical
element
forming
a
relatively
dispensable
class
the
hupa
word
i
will
go
for
example
consists
of
a
radical
element
to
go
three
essential
prefixes
and
a
formally
subsidiary
suffix
the
element
indicates
that
the
act
takes
place
here
and
there
in
space
or
continuously
over
space
practically
it
has
no
significance
apart
from
such
verb
stems
as
it
is
customary
to
connect
it
with
the
second
prefixed
element
is
even
less
easy
to
define
all
we
can
say
is
that
it
is
used
in
verb
forms
of
definite
time
and
that
it
marks
action
as
in
progress
rather
than
as
beginning
or
coming
to
an
end
the
third
prefix
is
a
pronominal
element
i
which
can
be
used
only
in
definite
tenses
it
is
highly
important
to
understand
that
the
use
of
is
conditional
on
that
of
or
of
certain
alternative
prefixes
and
that
also
is
in
practice
linked
with
the
group
is
a
firmly
knit
grammatical
unit
the
suffix
which
indicates
the
future
is
no
more
necessary
to
its
formal
balance
than
is
the
prefixed
of
the
latin
word
it
is
not
an
element
that
is
capable
of
standing
alone
but
its
function
is
materially
delimiting
rather
than
strictly
formal
footnote
including
such
languages
as
navaho
apache
hupa
carrier
chipewyan

footnote
this
may
seem
surprising
to
an
english
reader
we
generally
think
of
time
as
a
function
that
is
appropriately
expressed
in
a
purely
formal
manner
this
notion
is
due
to
the
bias
that
latin
grammar
has
given
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
english
future
shall
is
not
expressed
by
affixing
at
all
moreover
it
may
be
expressed
by
the
present
as
in
i
leave
this
where
the
temporal
function
is
inherent
in
the
independent
adverb
though
in
lesser
degree
the
hupa
is
as
irrelevant
to
the
vital
word
as
is
to
the
grammatical
feel
of
it
is
not
always
however
that
we
can
clearly
set
off
the
suffixes
of
a
language
as
a
group
against
its
prefixes
in
probably
the
majority
of
languages
that
use
both
types
of
affixes
each
group
has
both
delimiting
and
formal
or
relational
functions
the
most
that
we
can
say
is
that
a
language
tends
to
express
similar
functions
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
manner
if
a
certain
verb
expresses
a
certain
tense
by
suffixing
the
probability
is
strong
that
it
expresses
its
other
tenses
in
an
analogous
fashion
and
that
indeed
all
verbs
have
suffixed
tense
elements
similarly
we
normally
expect
to
find
the
pronominal
elements
so
far
as
they
are
included
in
the
verb
at
all
either
consistently
prefixed
or
suffixed
but
these
rules
are
far
from
absolute
we
have
already
seen
that
hebrew
prefixes
its
pronominal
elements
in
certain
cases
suffixes
them
in
others
in
chimariko
an
indian
language
of
california
the
position
of
the
pronominal
affixes
depends
on
the
verb
they
are
prefixed
for
certain
verbs
suffixed
for
others
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
give
many
further
examples
of
prefixing
and
suffixing
one
of
each
category
will
suffice
to
illustrate
their
formative
possibilities

and
have
become
accepted
as
part
of
our
normal
vocabulary
but
the
method
of
duplication
may
on
occasion
be
used
more
freely
than
is
indicated
by
such
stereotyped
examples
such
locutions
as
big
big

cool

our

would
lead
one
to
suppose
in
a
class
by
themselves
are
the
really
enormous
number
of
words
many
of
them
or
contemptuous
in
psychological
tone
that
consist
of
duplications
with
either
change
of
the
vowel
or
change
of
the
initial
consonant
words
of
the

words
of
this
type
are
all

universal
such
examples
as
the
russian
a
dragon
the
chinese
rattling
of
rain
on
the
roof
the
tibetan
lazy
and
the
manchu
are
curiously
reminiscent
both
in
form
and
in
psychology
of
words
nearer
home
but
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
duplicative
process
is
of
a
distinctively
grammatical
significance
in
english
we
must
turn
to
other
languages
for
illustration
such
cases

we
come
now
to
the
subtlest
of
all
grammatical
processes
variations
in
accent
whether
of
stress
or
pitch
the
chief
difficulty
in
isolating
accent
as
a
functional
process
is
that
it
is
so
often
combined
with
alternations
in
vocalic
quantity
or
quality
or
complicated
by
the
presence
of
affixed
elements
that
its
grammatical
value
appears
as
a
secondary
rather
than
as
a
primary
feature
in
greek
for
instance
it
is
characteristic
of
true
verbal
forms
that
they
throw
the
accent
back
as
far
as
the
general
accentual
rules
will
permit
while
nouns
may
be
more
freely
accented
there
is
thus
a
striking
accentual
difference
between
a
verbal
form
like
we
were
released
accented
on
the
second
syllable
of
the
word
and
its
participial
derivative
released
accented
on
the
last
the
presence
of
the
characteristic
verbal
elements
and
in
the
first
case
and
of
the
nominal
in
the
second
tends
to
obscure
the
inherent
value
of
the
accentual
alternation
this
value
comes
out
very
neatly
in
such
english
doublets
as
and
and
extract
to
come
and
come
lack
and
in
which
the
difference
between
the
verb
and
the
noun
is
entirely
a
matter
of
changing
stress
in
the
athabaskan
languages
there
are
not
infrequently
significant
alternations
of
accent
as
in
navaho
you
wash
yourself
accented
on
the
second
syllable
he
washes
himself
accented
on
the
first
footnote
it
is
not
unlikely
however
that
these
athabaskan
alternations
are
primarily
tonal
in
character
pitch
accent
may
be
as
functional
as
stress
and
is
perhaps
more
often
so
the
mere
fact
however
that
pitch
variations
are
phonetically
essential
to
the
language
as
in
chinese
wind
with
a
level
tone
to
serve
with
a
falling
tone
or
as
in
classical
greek
having
taken
with
a
simple
or
high
tone
on
the
suffixed
participial
of
women
with
a
compound
or
falling
tone
on
the
case
suffix
does
not
necessarily
constitute
a
functional
or
perhaps
we
had
better
say
grammatical
use
of
pitch
in
such
cases
the
pitch
is
merely
inherent
in
the
radical
element
or
affix
as
any
vowel
or
consonant
might
be
it
is
different
with
such
chinese
alternations
as
level
middle
and
falling
to
hit
the
middle
rising
to
buy
and
falling
to
sell
falling
back
and
level
to
carry
on
the
back
examples
of
this
type
are
not
exactly
common
in
chinese
and
the
language
can
not
be
said
to
possess
at
present
a
definite
feeling
for
tonal
differences
as
symbolic
of
the
distinction
between
noun
and
verb
there
are
languages
however
in
which
such
differences
are
of
the
most
fundamental
grammatical
importance
they
are
particularly
common
in
the
soudan
in
ewe
for
instance
there
are
formed
from
to
serve
two
reduplicated
forms
an
infinitive
to
serve
with
a
low
tone
on
the
first
two
syllables
and
a
high
one
on
the
last
two
and
an
adjectival
serving
in
which
all
the
syllables
have
a
high
tone
even
more
striking
are
cases
furnished
by
shilluk
one
of
the
languages
of
the
headwaters
of
the
nile
the
plural
of
the
noun
often
differs
in
tone
from
the
singular
high
ear
but
low
ears
in
the
pronoun
three
forms
may
be
distinguished
by
tone
alone
he
has
a
high
tone
and
is
subjective
him
he
called
him
has
a
low
tone
and
is
objective
his

a
middle
tone
and
is
possessive

the
verbal
element

formed
he

a
low
tone
the
passive
it
was
written
with
a

the
imperative

a
rising
tone
and
the
verbal
noun

a
middle
tone
in
aboriginal
america
also
pitch
accent
is
known
to
occur
as
a
grammatical
process
a
good
example
of
such
a
pitch
language
is
tlingit
spoken
by
the
indians
of
the
southern
coast
of
alaska
in
this
language
many
verbs
vary
the
tone
of
the
radical
element
according
to
tense
to
sell
to
hide
to
see
and
numerous
other
radical
elements
if
refer
to
past
time
if
to
the
future
another
type
of
function
is
illustrated
by
the
takelma
forms

with
a
rising
inflection
parallel
to
these
forms
are
falling
black

paint
it
all
in
all
it
is
clear
that
pitch
accent
like
stress
and
vocalic
or
consonantal
modifications
is
far
less
infrequently
employed
as
a
grammatical
process
than
our
own
habits
of
speech
would
prepare
us
to
believe
probable
v
form
in
language
grammatical
concepts
we
have
seen
that
the
single
word
expresses
either
a
simple
concept
or
a
combination
of
concepts
so
interrelated
as
to
form
a
psychological
unity
we
have
furthermore
briefly
reviewed
from
a
strictly
formal
standpoint
the
main
processes
that
are
used
by
all
known
languages
to
affect
the
fundamental
concepts
those
embodied
in
unanalyzable
words
or
in
the
radical
elements
of
words
by
the
modifying
or
formative
influence
of
subsidiary
concepts
in
this
chapter
we
shall
look
a
little
more
closely
into
the
nature
of
the
world
of
concepts
in
so
far
as
that
world
is
reflected
and
systematized
in
linguistic
structure
let
us
begin
with
a
simple
sentence
that
involves
various
kinds
of
concepts
farmer
kills
the
a
rough
and
ready
analysis
discloses
here
the
presence
of
three
distinct
and
fundamental
concepts
that
are
brought
into
connection
with
each
other
in
a
number
of
ways
these
three
concepts
are
farmer
the
subject
of
discourse
kill
defining
the
nature
of
the
activity
which
the
sentence
informs
us
about
and
duckling
another
subject
of
discourse
that
takes
an
important
though
somewhat
passive
part
in
this
activity
we
can
visualize
the
farmer
and
the
duckling
and
we
have
also
no
difficulty
in
constructing
an
image
of
the
killing
in
other
words
the
elements
and
define
concepts
of
a
concrete
order
footnote
not
in
its
technical
sense
but
a
more
careful
linguistic
analysis
soon
brings
us
to
see
that
the
two
subjects
of
discourse
however
simply
we
may
visualize
them
are
not
expressed
quite
as
directly
as
immediately
as
we
feel
them
a
farmer
is
in
one
sense
a
perfectly
unified
concept
in
another
he
is
one
who
farms
the
concept
conveyed
by
the
radical
element
is
not
one
of
personality
at
all
but
of
an
industrial
activity
itself
based
on
the
concept
of
a
particular
type
of
object
similarly
the
concept
of
is
at
one
remove
from
that
which
is
expressed
by
the
radical
element
of
the
word
this
element
which
may
occur
as
an
independent
word
refers
to
a
whole
class
of
animals
big
and
little
while
is
limited
in
its
application
to
the
young
of
that
class
the
word
has
an
agentive
suffix
that
performs
the
function
of
indicating
the
one
that
carries
out
a
given
activity
in
this
case
that
of
farming
it
transforms
the
verb
into
an
agentive
noun
precisely
as
it
transforms
the
verbs
into
the
corresponding
agentive
nouns
the
element
is
not
so
freely
used
but
its
significance
is
obvious
it
adds
to
the
basic
concept
the
notion
of
smallness
as
also
in
or
the
somewhat
related
notion
of
contemptible
as
in
the
agentive
and
the
diminutive
both
convey
fairly
concrete
ideas
roughly
those
of
doer
and
little
but
the
concreteness
is
not
stressed
they
do
not
so
much
define
distinct
concepts
as
mediate
between
concepts
the
of
does
not
quite
say
one
who
farms
it
merely
indicates
that
the
sort
of
person
we
call
a
farmer
is
closely
enough
associated
with
activity
on
a
farm
to
be
conventionally
thought
of
as
always
so
occupied
he
may
as
a
matter
of
fact
go
to
town
and
engage
in
any
pursuit
but
farming
yet
his
linguistic
label
remains
farmer
language
here
betrays
a
certain
helplessness
or
if
one
prefers
a
stubborn
tendency
to
look
away
from
the
immediately
suggested
function
trusting
to
the
imagination
and
to
usage
to
fill
in
the
transitions
of
thought
and
the
details
of
application
that
distinguish
one
concrete
concept
from
another
derived
one
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
language
to
express
every
concrete
idea
by
an
independent
word
or
radical
element
the
concreteness
of
experience
is
infinite
the
resources
of
the
richest
language
are
strictly
limited
it
must
perforce
throw
countless
concepts
under
the
rubric
of
certain
basic
ones
using
other
concrete
or
ideas
as
functional
mediators
the
ideas
expressed
by
these
mediating
elements
they
may
be
independent
words
affixes
or
modifications
of
the
radical
element
may
be
called
derivational
or
qualifying
some
concrete
concepts
such
as
are
expressed
radically
others
such
as
and
are
expressed
derivatively
corresponding
to
these
two
modes
of
expression
we
have
two
types
of
concepts
and
of
linguistic
elements
radical
and
derivational
when
a
word
or
unified
group
of
words
contains
a
derivational
element
or
word
the
concrete
significance
of
the
radical
element
tends
to
fade
from
consciousness
and
to
yield
to
a
new
concreteness
that
is
synthetic
in
expression
rather
than
in
thought
in
our
sentence
the
concepts
of
and
are
not
really
involved
at
all
they
are
merely
latent
for
formal
reasons
in
the
linguistic
expression
returning
to
this
sentence
we
feel
that
the
analysis
of
and
are
practically
irrelevant
to
an
understanding
of
its
content
and
entirely
irrelevant
to
a
feeling
for
the
structure
of
the
sentence
as
a
whole
from
the
standpoint
of
the
sentence
the
derivational
elements
and
are
merely
details
in
the
local
economy
of
two
of
its
terms
that
it
accepts
as
units
of
expression
this
indifference
of
the
sentence
as
such
to
some
part
of
the
analysis
of
its
words
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
if
we
substitute
such
radical
words
as
and
for
and
we
obtain
a
new
material
content
it
is
true
but
not
in
the
least
a
new
structural
mold
we
can
go
further
and
substitute
another
activity
for
that
of
killing
say
taking
the
new
sentence
man
takes
the
is
totally
different
from
the
first
sentence
in
what
it
conveys
not
in
how
it
conveys
it
we
feel
instinctively
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
conscious
analysis
that
the
two
sentences
fit
precisely
the
same
pattern
that
they
are
really
the
same
fundamental
sentence
differing
only
in
their
material
trappings
in
other
words
they
express
identical
relational
concepts
in
an
identical
manner
the
manner
is
here
threefold
the
use
of
an
inherently
relational
word
in
analogous
positions
the
analogous
sequence
subject
predicate
consisting
of
verb
and
object
of
the
concrete
terms
of
the
sentence
and
the
use
of
the
suffixed
element
in
the
verb
change
any
of
these
features
of
the
sentence
and
it
becomes
modified
slightly
or
seriously
in
some
purely
relational
regard
if
is
omitted
kills
takes
the
sentence
becomes
impossible
it
falls
into
no
recognized
formal
pattern
and
the
two
subjects
of
discourse
seem
to
hang
incompletely
in
the
void
we
feel
that
there
is
no
relation
established
between
either
of
them
and
what
is
already
in
the
minds
of
the
speaker
and
his
auditor
as
soon
as
a
is
put
before
the
two
nouns
we
feel
relieved
we
know
that
the
farmer
and
duckling
which
the
sentence
tells
us
about
are
the
same
farmer
and
duckling
that
we
had
been
talking
about
or
hearing
about
or
thinking
about
some
time
before
if
i
meet
a
man
who
is
not
looking
at
and
knows
nothing
about
the
farmer
in
question
i
am
likely
to
be
stared
at
for
my
pains
if
i
announce
to
him
that
the
farmer
what
farmer
kills
the
duckling
did
know
he
had
any
whoever
he
is
if
the
fact
nevertheless
seems
interesting
enough
to
communicate
i
should
be
compelled
to
speak
of
up
my
way
and
of
of
his
these
little
words
and
have
the
important
function
of
establishing
a
definite
or
an
indefinite
reference
if
i
omit
the
first
and
also
leave
out
the
suffixed
i
obtain
an
entirely
new
set
of
relations

the
implies
that
i
am
now
speaking
to
the
farmer
not
merely
about
him
further
that
he
is
not
actually
killing
the
bird
but
is
being
ordered
by
me
to
do
so
the
subjective
relation
of
the
first
sentence
has
become
a
vocative
one
one
of
address
and
the
activity
is
conceived
in
terms
of
command
not
of
statement
we
conclude
therefore
that
if
the
farmer
is
to
be
merely
talked
about
the
little
must
go
back
into
its
place
and
the
must
not
be
removed
the
latter
element
clearly
defines
or
rather
helps
to
define
statement
as
contrasted
with
command
i
find
moreover
that
if
i
wish
to
speak
of
several
farmers
i
can
not
say
farmers
kills
the
but
must
say
farmers
kill
the
evidently
involves
the
notion
of
singularity
in
the
subject
if
the
noun
is
singular
the
verb
must
have
a
form
to
correspond
if
the
noun
is
plural
the
verb
has
another
corresponding
form
comparison
with
such
forms
as
and
shows
moreover
that
the
has
exclusive
reference
to
a
person
other
than
the
speaker
or
the
one
spoken
to
we
conclude
therefore
that
it
connotes
a
personal
relation
as
well
as
the
notion
of
singularity
and
comparison
with
a
sentence
like
farmer
killed
the
indicates
that
there
is
implied
in
this
overburdened
a
distinct
reference
to
present
time
statement
as
such
and
personal
reference
may
well
be
looked
upon
as
inherently
relational
concepts
number
is
evidently
felt
by
those
who
speak
english
as
involving
a
necessary
relation
otherwise
there
would
be
no
reason
to
express
the
concept
twice
in
the
noun
and
in
the
verb
time
also
is
clearly
felt
as
a
relational
concept
if
it
were
not
we
should
be
allowed
to
say
farmer
to
correspond
to
farmer
of
the
four
concepts
inextricably
interwoven
in
the
suffix
all
are
felt
as
relational
two
necessarily
so
the
distinction
between
a
truly
relational
concept
and
one
that
is
so
felt
and
treated
though
it
need
not
be
in
the
nature
of
things
will
receive
further
attention
in
a
moment
footnote
it
is
of
course
an
accident
that
denotes
plurality
in
the
noun
singularity
in
the
verb
finally
i
can
radically
disturb
the
relational
cut
of
the
sentence
by
changing
the
order
of
its
elements
if
the
positions
of
and
are
interchanged
the
sentence
reads
the
farmer
the
which
is
most
naturally
interpreted
as
an
unusual
but
not
unintelligible
mode
of
asking
the
question
the
farmer
kill
the
duckling
in
this
new
sentence
the
act
is
not
conceived
as
necessarily
taking
place
at
all
it
may
or
it
may
not
be
happening
the
implication
being
that
the
speaker
wishes
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
that
the
person
spoken
to
is
expected
to
give
him
the
information
the
interrogative
sentence
possesses
an
entirely
different
modality
from
the
declarative
one
and
implies
a
markedly
different
attitude
of
the
speaker
towards
his
companion
an
even
more
striking
change
in
personal
relations
is
effected
if
we
interchange
and
duckling
kills
the
involves
precisely
the
same
subjects
of
discourse
and
the
same
type
of
activity
as
our
first
sentence
but
the
roles
of
these
subjects
of
discourse
are
now
reversed
the
duckling
has
turned
like
the
proverbial
worm
or
to
put
it
in
grammatical
terminology
what
was
subject
is
now
object
what
was
object
is
now
subject
the
following
tabular
statement
analyzes
the
sentence
from
the

of
view
of
the
concepts
expressed
in
it
and
of
the

their
expression

in

and
by
suffixed
in
this
short
sentence
of
five
words
there
are
expressed
therefore
thirteen
distinct
concepts
of
which
three
are
radical
and
concrete
two
derivational
and
eight
relational
perhaps
the
most
striking
result
of
the
analysis
is
a
renewed
realization
of
the
curious
lack
of
accord
in
our
language
between
function
and
form
the
method
of
suffixing
is
used
both
for
derivational
and
for
relational
elements
independent
words
or
radical
elements
express
both
concrete
ideas
objects
activities
qualities
and
relational
ideas
articles
like
and
words
defining
case
relations
like
words
defining
local
relations
like
the
same
relational
concept
may
be
expressed
more
than
once
thus
the
singularity
of
is
both
negatively
expressed
in
the
noun
and
positively
in
the
verb
and
one
element
may
convey
a
group
of
interwoven
concepts
rather
than
one
definite
concept
alone
thus
the
of
embodies
no
less
than
four
logically
independent
relations
our
analysis
may
seem
a
bit
labored
but
only
because
we
are
so
accustomed
to
our
own
grooves
of
expression
that
they
have
come
to
be
felt
as
inevitable
yet
destructive
analysis
of
the
familiar
is
the
only
method
of
approach
to
an
understanding
of
fundamentally
different
modes
of
expression
when
one
has
learned
to
feel
what
is
fortuitous
or
illogical
or
unbalanced
in
the
structure
of
his
own
language
he
is
already
well
on
the
way
towards
a
sympathetic
grasp
of
the
expression
of
the
various
classes
of
concepts
in
alien
types
of
speech
not
everything
that
is
outlandish
is
intrinsically
illogical
or
it
is
often
precisely
the
familiar
that
a
wider
perspective
reveals
as
the
curiously
exceptional
from
a
purely
logical
standpoint
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
no
inherent
reason
why
the
concepts
expressed
in
our
sentence
should
have
been
singled
out
treated
and
grouped
as
they
have
been
and
not
otherwise
the
sentence
is
the
outgrowth
of
historical
and
of
unreasoning
psychological
forces
rather
than
of
a
logical
synthesis
of
elements
that
have
been
clearly
grasped
in
their
individuality
this
is
the
case
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
in
all
languages
though
in
the
forms
of
many
we
find
a
more
coherent
a
more
consistent
reflection
than
in
our
english
forms
of
that
unconscious
analysis
into
individual
concepts
which
is
never
entirely
absent
from
speech
however
it
may
be
complicated
with
or
overlaid
by
the
more
irrational
factors
a
cursory
examination
of
other
languages
near
and
far
would
soon
show
that
some
or
all
of
the
thirteen
concepts
that
our
sentence
happens
to
embody
may
not
only
be
expressed
in
different
form
but
that
they
may
be
differently
grouped
among
themselves
that
some
among
them
may
be
dispensed
with
and
that
other
concepts
not
considered
worth
expressing
in
english
idiom
may
be
treated
as
absolutely
indispensable
to
the
intelligible
rendering
of
the
proposition
first
as
to
a
different
method
of
handling
such
concepts
as
we
have
found
expressed
in
the
english
sentence
if
we
turn
to
german
we
find
that
in
the
equivalent
sentence
bauer
tötet
das
the
definiteness
of
reference
expressed
by
the
english
is
unavoidably
coupled
with
three
other
concepts
number
both
and
are
explicitly
singular
case
is
subjective
is
subjective
or
objective
by
elimination
therefore
objective
and
gender
a
new
concept
of
the
relational
order
that
is
not
in
this
case
explicitly
involved
in
english
is
masculine
is
neuter
indeed
the
chief
burden
of
the
expression
of
case
gender
and
number
is
in
the
german
sentence
borne
by
the
particles
of
reference
rather
than
by
the
words
that
express
the
concrete
concepts
to
which
these
relational
concepts
ought
logically
to
attach
themselves
in
the
sphere
of
concrete
concepts
too
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
german
splits
up
the
idea
of
killing
into
the
basic
concept
of
dead
and
the
derivational
one
of
causing
to
do
or
be
so
and
so
by
the
method
of
vocalic
change
the
german
analytically
causes
to
be
dead
is
approximately
the
formal
equivalent
of
our
though
the
idiomatic
application
of
this
latter
word
is
different
footnote
to
cause
to
be
dead
or
to
cause
to
die
in
the
sense
of
to
kill
is
an
exceedingly
usage
it
is
found
for
instance
also
in
nootka
and
sioux
wandering
still
further
afield
we
may
glance
at
the
yana
method
of
expression
literally
translated
the
equivalent
yana
sentence
would
read
something
like
he
farmer
he
to
in
which
he
and
to
are
rather
awkward
english
renderings
of
a
general
third
personal
pronoun
or
and
an
objective
particle
which
indicates
that
the
following
noun
is
connected
with
the
verb
otherwise
than
as
subject
the
suffixed
element
in
corresponds
to
the
english
suffix
with
the
important
exceptions
that
it
makes
no
reference
to
the
number
of
the
subject
and
that
the
statement
is
known
to
be
true
that
it
is
vouched
for
by
the
speaker
number
is
only
indirectly
expressed
in
the
sentence
in
so
far
as
there
is
no
specific
verb
suffix
indicating
plurality
of
the
subject
nor
specific
plural
elements
in
the
two
nouns
had
the
statement
been
made
on
another
authority
a
totally
different
suffix
would
have
had
to
be
used
the
pronouns
of
reference
he
imply
nothing
by
themselves
as
to
number
gender
or
case
gender
indeed
is
completely
absent
in
yana
as
a
relational
category
footnote
agriculture
was
not
practised
by
the
yana
the
verbal
idea
of
to
farm
would
probably
be
expressed
in
some
such
synthetic
manner
as
to
or
to
there
are
suffixed
elements
corresponding
to
and
the
yana
sentence
has
already
illustrated
the
point
that
certain
of
our
supposedly
essential
concepts
may
be
ignored
both
the
yana
and
the
german
sentence
illustrate
the
further
point
that
certain
concepts
may
need
expression
for
which
an
person
or
rather
the
habit
finds
no
need
whatever
one
could
go
on
and
give
endless
examples
of
such
deviations
from
english
form
but
we
shall
have
to
content
ourselves
with
a
few
more
indications
in
the
chinese
sentence
man
kill
duck
which
may
be
looked
upon
as
the
practical
equivalent
of
the
man
kills
the
duck
there
is
by
no
means
present
for
the
chinese
consciousness
that
childish
halting
empty
feeling
which
we
experience
in
the
literal
english
translation
the
three
concrete
concepts
two
objects
and
an
action
are
each
directly
expressed
by
a
monosyllabic
word
which
is
at
the
same
time
a
radical
element
the
two
relational
concepts
subject
and
object
are
expressed
solely
by
the
position
of
the
concrete
words
before
and
after
the
word
of
action
and
that
is
all
definiteness
or
indefiniteness
of
reference
number
personality
as
an
inherent
aspect
of
the
verb
tense
not
to
speak
of
gender
all
these
are
given
no
expression
in
the
chinese
sentence
which
for
all
that
is
a
perfectly
adequate
communication
provided
of
course
there
is
that
context
that
background
of
mutual
understanding
that
is
essential
to
the
complete
intelligibility
of
all
speech
nor
does
this
qualification
impair
our
argument
for
in
the
english
sentence
too
we
leave
unexpressed
a
large
number
of
ideas
which
are
either
taken
for
granted
or
which
have
been
developed
or
are
about
to
be
developed
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
nothing
has
been
said
for
example
in
the
english
german
yana
or
chinese
sentence
as
to
the
place
relations
of
the
farmer
the
duck
the
speaker
and
the

are
the
farmer
and
the
duck
both
visible
or
is
one
or
the
other
invisible
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
speaker
and
are
both
placed
within
the
horizon
of
the
speaker
the
listener
or
of
some
indefinite
point
of
reference
off
yonder
in
other
words
to
paraphrase
awkwardly
certain
latent
demonstrative
ideas
does
this
farmer
invisible
to
us
but
standing
behind
a
door
not
far
away
from
me
you
being
seated
yonder
well
out
of
reach
kill
that
duckling
which
belongs
to
you
or
does
that
farmer
who
lives
in
your
neighborhood
and
whom
we
see
over
there
kill
that
duckling
that
belongs
to
him
this
type
of
demonstrative
elaboration
is
foreign
to
our
way
of
thinking
but
it
would
seem
very
natural
indeed
unavoidable
to
a
kwakiutl
indian
what
then
are
the
absolutely
essential
concepts
in
speech
the
concepts
that
must
be
expressed
if
language
is
to
be
a
satisfactory
means
of
communication
clearly
we
must
have
first
of
all
a
large
stock
of
basic
or
radical
concepts
the
concrete
wherewithal
of
speech
we
must
have
objects
actions
qualities
to
talk
about
and
these
must
have
their
corresponding
symbols
in
independent
words
or
in
radical
elements
no
proposition
however
abstract
its
intent
is
humanly
possible
without
a
tying
on
at
one
or
more
points
to
the
concrete
world
of
sense
in
every
intelligible
proposition
at
least
two
of
these
radical
ideas
must
be
expressed
though
in
exceptional
cases
one
or
even
both
may
be
understood
from
the
context
and
secondly
such
relational
concepts
must
be
expressed
as
moor
the
concrete
concepts
to
each
other
and
construct
a
definite
fundamental
form
of
proposition
in
this
fundamental
form
there
must
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relations
that
obtain
between
the
concrete
concepts
we
must
know
what
concrete
concept
is
directly
or
indirectly
related
to
what
other
and
how
if
we
wish
to
talk
of
a
thing
and
an
action
we
must
know
if
they
are
coördinately
related
to
each
other
he
is
fond
of
and
or
if
the
thing
is
conceived
of
as
the
starting
point
the
doer
of
the
action
or
as
it
is
customary
to
say
the
subject
of
which
the
action
is
predicated
or
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
end
point
the
object
of
the
action
if
i
wish
to
communicate
an
intelligible
idea
about
a
farmer
a
duckling
and
the
act
of
killing
it
is
not
enough
to
state
the
linguistic
symbols
for
these
concrete
ideas
in
any
order
trusting
that
the
hearer
may
construct
some
kind
of
a
relational
pattern
out
of
the
general
probabilities
of
the
case
the
fundamental
syntactic
relations
must
be
unambiguously
expressed
i
can
afford
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
of
time
and
place
and
number
and
of
a
host
of
other
possible
types
of
concepts
but
i
can
find
no
way
of
dodging
the
issue
as
to
who
is
doing
the
killing
there
is
no
known
language
that
can
or
does
dodge
it
any
more
than
it
succeeds
in
saying
something
without
the
use
of
symbols
for
the
concrete
concepts
we
are
thus
once
more
reminded
of
the
distinction
between
essential
or
unavoidable
relational
concepts
and
the
dispensable
type
the
former
are
universally
expressed
the
latter
are
but
sparsely
developed
in
some
languages
elaborated
with
a
bewildering
exuberance
in
others
but
what
prevents
us
from
throwing
in
these
dispensable
or
secondary
relational
concepts
with
the
large
floating
group
of
derivational
qualifying
concepts
that
we
have
already
discussed
is
there
after
all
is
said
and
done
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
qualifying
concept
like
the
negative
in
and
a
relational
one
like
the
number
concept
in
if
may
be
roughly
paraphrased
as
may
not
be
just
as
legitimately
paraphrased
barring
the
violence
to
english
idiom
as
book
there
are
indeed
languages
in
which
the
plural
if
expressed
at
all
is
conceived
of
in
the
same
sober
restricted
one
might
almost
say
casual
spirit
in
which
we
feel
the
negative
in
for
such
languages
the
number
concept
has
no
syntactic
significance
whatever
is
not
essentially
conceived
of
as
defining
a
relation
but
falls
into
the
group
of
derivational
or
even
of
basic
concepts
in
english
however
as
in
french
german
latin
greek
indeed
in
all
the
languages
that
we
have
most
familiarity
with
the
idea
of
number
is
not
merely
appended
to
a
given
concept
of
a
thing
it
may
have
something
of
this
merely
qualifying
value
but
its
force
extends
far
beyond
it
infects
much
else
in
the
sentence
molding
other
concepts
even
such
as
have
no
intelligible
relation
to
number
into
forms
that

it

not

because
the

in

nature

relate

also
to
the

we

in

what
most
languages
in
greater

degree
and
in
a
hundred
varying
ways
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
throwing
a
bold
bridge
between
the
two
basically
distinct
types
of
concept
the
concrete
and
the
abstractly
relational

the
latter

it
were
with
the
color

grossness
of
the
former

a
certain
violence

forced

do
duty
for

intertwine
itself
with
the
strictly
relational
the
case
is
even
more
obvious
if
we
take
gender
as
our
text
in
the
two
english
phrases
the
white
woman
that
comes
and
the
white
men
that
come
we
are
not
reminded
that
gender
as
well
as
number
may
be
elevated
into
a
secondary
relational
concept
it
would
seem
a
little
to
make
of
masculinity
and
femininity
crassly
material
philosophically
accidental
concepts
that
they
are
a
means
of
relating
quality
and
person
person
and
action
nor
would
it
easily
occur
to
us
if
we
had
not
studied
the
classics
that
it
was
anything
but
absurd
to
inject
into
two
such
highly
attenuated
relational
concepts
as
are
expressed
by
the

that
the
combined

no
less
than

a
radical

concrete

demonstrative

three
relational

from
the
categories

either
merely
parasitic

well
say
of

how
pedantically
imaginative

must
be
difficult
for
him
when
first
confronted
by
the
illogical
complexities
of
our
european
languages
to
feel
at
home
in
an
attitude
that
so
largely
confounds
the
of
speech
with
its
formal
pattern
or
to
be
more
accurate
that
turns
certain
fundamentally
concrete
concepts
to
such
attenuated
relational
uses

in

far

this

a
rather
awkward
roundabout
method
of
establishing
the
attribution

the

to
the
particular

one
can
not
in

directly
say
that

that

i
have
exaggerated
somewhat
the
concreteness
of
our
subsidiary
or
rather
relational
concepts
in
order
that
the
essential
facts
might
come
out
in
bold
relief
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
frenchman
has
no
clear
sex
notion
in
his
mind
when
he
speaks
of
tree
or
of
apple
nor
have
we
despite
the
grammarians
a
very
vivid
sense
of
the
present
as
contrasted
with
all
past
and
all
future
time
when
we
say
this
is
evident
from
our
use
of
the
present
to
indicate
both
future
time
he
comes
and
general
activity
unspecified
as
to
time
whenever
he
comes
i
am
glad
to
see
him
where
comes
refers
to
past
occurrences
and
possible
future
ones
rather
than
to
present
activity
in
both
the
french
and
english
instances
the
primary
ideas
of
sex
and
time
have
become
diluted
by
and
by
extensions
into
the
relational
sphere
the
concepts
ostensibly
indicated
being
now
so
vaguely
delimited
that
it
is
rather
the
tyranny
of
usage
than
the
need
of
their
concrete
expression
that
sways
us
in
the
selection
of
this
or
that
form
if
the
process
continues
long
enough
we
may
eventually
be
left
with
a
system
of
forms
on
our
hands
from
which
all
the
color
of
life
has
vanished
and
which
merely
persist
by
inertia
duplicating
each
other
secondary
syntactic
functions
with
endless
prodigality
hence
in
part
the
complex
conjugational
systems
of
so
many
languages
in
which
differences
of
form
are
attended
by
no
assignable
differences
of
function
there
must
have
been
a
time
for
instance
though
it
antedates
our
earliest
documentary
evidence
when
the
type
of
tense
formation
represented
by
or
differed
in
meaning
in
however
slightly
nuanced
a
degree
from
the
type
which
has
now
become
established
in
english
as
the
prevailing
preterit
formation
very
much
as
we
recognize
a
valuable
distinction
at
present
between
both
these
types
and
the
perfect
driven
has
but
may
have
ceased
to
do
so
at
some
point
in
the
future
now
form
lives
longer
than
its
own
conceptual
content
both
are
ceaselessly
changing
but
on
the
whole
the
form
tends
to
linger
on
when
the
spirit
has
flown
or
changed
its
being
irrational
form
form
for
form
sake
however
we
term
this
tendency
to
hold
on
to
formal
distinctions
once
they
have
come
to
be
is
as
natural
to
the
life
of
language
as
is
the
retention
of
modes
of
conduct
that
have
long
outlived
the
meaning
they
once
had
footnote
aside
naturally
from
the
life
and
imminence
that
may
be
created
for
such
a
sentence
by
a
particular
context
footnote
this
has
largely
happened
in
popular
french
and
german
where
the
difference
is
stylistic
rather
than
functional
the
preterits
are
more
literary
or
formal
in
tone
than
the
perfects
there
is
another
powerful
tendency
which
makes
for
a
formal
elaboration
that
does
not
strictly
correspond
to
conceptual
differences
this
is
the
tendency
to
construct
schemes
of
classification
into
which
all
the
concepts
of
language
must
be
fitted
once
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
all
things
are
either
definitely
good
or
bad
or
definitely
black
or
white
it
is
difficult
to
get
into
the
frame
of
mind
that
recognizes
that
any
particular
thing
may
be
both
good
and
bad
in
other
words
indifferent
or
both
black
and
white
in
other
words
gray
still
more
difficult
to
realize
that
the
or
categories
may
not
apply
at
all
language
is
in
many
respects
as
unreasonable
and
stubborn
about
its
classifications
as
is
such
a
mind
it
must
have
its
perfectly
exclusive
and
will
tolerate
no
flying
vagrants
any
concept
that
asks
for
expression
must
submit
to
the
classificatory
rules
of
the
game
just
as
there
are
statistical
surveys
in
which
even
the
most
convinced
atheist
must
perforce
be
labeled
catholic
protestant
or
jew
or
get
no
hearing
in
english
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
all
action
must
be
conceived
of
in
reference
to
three
standard
times
if
therefore
we
desire
to
state
a
proposition
that
is
as
true
as
it
was
yesterday
we
have
to
pretend
that
the
present
moment
may
be
elongated
fore
and
aft
so
as
to
take
in
all
eternity
in
french
we
know
once
for
all
that
an
object
is
masculine
or
feminine
whether
it
be
living
or
not
just
as
in
many
american
and
east
asiatic
languages
it
must
be
understood
to
belong
to
a
certain
say
long
and
slender
cylindrical
in
mass
like
sugar
before
it
can
be
enumerated
two
potatoes
three
carpets
or
even
said
to
be
or
be
handled
in
a
definite
way
thus
in
the
athabaskan
languages
and
in
yana
to
carry
or
throw
a
pebble
is
quite
another
thing
than
to
carry
or
throw
a
log
linguistically
no
less
than
in
terms
of
muscular
experience
such
instances
might
be
multiplied
at
will
it
is
almost
as
though
at
some
period
in
the
past
the
unconscious
mind
of
the
race
had
made
a
hasty
inventory
of
experience
committed
itself
to
a
premature
classification
that
allowed
of
no
revision
and
saddled
the
inheritors
of
its
language
with
a
science
that
they
no
longer
quite
believed
in
nor
had
the
strength
to
overthrow
dogma
rigidly
prescribed
by
tradition
stiffens
into
formalism
linguistic
categories
make
up
a
system
of
surviving
dogma
dogma
of
the
unconscious
they
are
often
but
half
real
as
concepts
their
life
tends
ever
to
languish
away
into
form
for
form
sake
footnote
hence
the
square
root
of
precisely
as
my
uncle
here
now
there
are
many
primitive
languages
that
are
more
philosophical
and
distinguish
between
a
true
present
and
a
customary
or
general
tense
there
is
still
a
third
cause
for
the
rise
of
this
form
or
rather
of
differences
of
form
this
is
the
mechanical
operation
of
phonetic
processes
which
may
bring
about
formal
distinctions
that
have
not
and
never
had
a
corresponding
functional
distinction
much
of
the
irregularity
and
general
formal
complexity
of
our
declensional
and
conjugational
systems
is
due
to
this
process
the
plural
of
is
the
plural
of
is
in
the
former
case
we
have
a
true
symbolizing
plurality
in
the
latter
a
coupled
with
a
change
in
the
radical
element
of
the
word
of
to
here
we
have
not
a
falling
together
of
forms
that
originally
stood
for
fairly
distinct
concepts
as
we
saw
was
presumably
the
case
with
such
parallel
forms
as
and
but
a
merely
mechanical
manifolding
of
the
same
formal
element
without
a
corresponding
growth
of
a
new
concept
this
type
of
form
development
therefore
while
of
the
greatest
interest
for
the
general
history
of
language
does
not
directly
concern
us
now
in
our
effort
to
understand
the
nature
of
grammatical
concepts
and
their
tendency
to
degenerate
into
purely
formal
counters
we
may
now
conveniently
revise
our
first
classification
of
concepts
as
expressed
in
language
and
suggest
the
following
scheme

such
as
objects
actions
qualities
normally
expressed
by
independent
words

radical
elements

no

by
affixing

by
inner
modification
of
these
differ
from
type
i
in
defining
ideas
that
are
irrelevant
to
the
proposition
as
a
whole
but
that
give
a
radical
element
a
particular
increment
of
significance
and
that
are
thus
inherently
related
in
a
specific
way
to
concepts
of
type
i

relational
still
more
abstract
yet
not
entirely
devoid
of
a
measure

concreteness

expressed

affixing

generally
at
a
greater
remove
from
these
than
is
the
case
with
elements
of
type
ii
or
by
inner
modification
of
radical
elements
differ
fundamentally
from
type
ii
in
indicating

implying
relations

transcend
the
particular

they
are
immediately
attached

leading
over
to
iv

by
their
inner
modification

independent
words

by

to
relate
the
concrete

in

particularly
apt
to
be
the
case
in

may
be
quite
sure
of
the
analysis
of
the

not
succeed
in
acquiring

the

wilfully

up

losing

happens
for

stage

ends
up

i
to
group
iv
there
is
also
a
constant
fading
away
of
the
feeling
of
sensible
reality
within
the
main
groups
of
linguistic
concepts
themselves
in
many
languages
it
becomes
almost
imperative
therefore
to
make
various
to
segregate
for
instance
the
more
concrete
from
the
more
abstract
concepts
of
group
ii
yet
we
must
always
beware
of
reading
into
such
abstracter
groups
that
purely
formal
relational
feeling
that
we
can
hardly
help
associating
with
certain
of
the
abstracter
concepts
which
with
us
fall
in
group
iii
unless
indeed
there
is
clear
evidence
to
warrant
such
a
reading
in
an
example
or
two
should
make
clear
these
distinctions
in
nootka
we
have
an
unusually
large
number
of
derivational
affixes
expressing
concepts
of
group
ii
some
of
these
are
quite
material
in
content
in
the
house
to
dream
of
others
like
an
element
denoting
plurality
and
a
diminutive
affix
are
far
more
abstract
in
content
the
former
type
are
more
closely
welded
with
the
radical
element
than
the
latter
which
can
only
be
suffixed
to
formations
that
have
the
value
of
complete
words
if
therefore
i
wish
to
say
the
small
fires
in
the
house
and
i
can
do
this
in
one
word
i
must
form
the
word
to
which
elements
corresponding
to
small
our
plural
and
the
are
appended
the
element
indicating
the
definiteness
of
reference
that
is
implied
in
our
the
comes
at
the
very
end
of
the
word
so
far
so
good
is
an
intelligible
correlate
of
our
the
but
is
the
nootka
correlate
of
the
small
fires
in
the
house
the
true
equivalent
of
an
english
by
no
means
first
of
all
the
plural
element
precedes
the
diminutive
in
nootka
in
other
words
the
which
at
once
reveals
the
important
fact
that
the
plural
concept
is
not
as
abstractly
as
relationally
felt
as
in
english
a
more
adequate
rendering
would
be
the
in
which
however
several
is
too
gross
a
word
too
choice
an
element
small
again
is
too
gross
in
truth
we
can
not
carry
over
into
english
the
inherent
feeling
of
the
nootka
word
which
seems
to
hover
somewhere
between
the
and
the
but
what
more
than
anything
else
cuts
off
all
possibility
of
comparison
between
the
english
of
and
the
of
the
nootka
word
is
this
that
in
nootka
neither
the
plural
nor
the
diminutive
affix
corresponds
or
refers
to
anything
else
in
the
sentence
in
english
the
burn
not
burns
in
nootka
neither
verb
nor
adjective
nor
anything
else
in
the
proposition
is
in
the
least
concerned
with
the
plurality
or
the
diminutiveness
of
the
fire
hence
while
nootka
recognizes
a
cleavage
between
concrete
and
less
concrete
concepts
within
group
ii
the
less
concrete
do
not
transcend
the
group
and
lead
us
into
that
abstracter
air
into
which
our
plural
carries
us
but
at
any
rate
the
reader
may
object
it
is
something
that
the
nootka
plural
affix
is
set
apart
from
the
concreter
group
of
affixes
and
may
not
the
nootka
diminutive
have
a
slenderer
a
more
elusive
content
than
our
or
or
the
german
or
footnote
it
is
precisely
the
failure
to
feel
the
value
or
tone
as
distinct
from
the
outer
significance
of
the
concept
expressed
by
a
given
grammatical
element
that
has
so
often
led
students
to
misunderstand
the
nature
of
languages
profoundly
alien
to
their
own
not
everything
that
calls
itself
tense
or
mode
or
number
or
gender
or
person
is
genuinely
comparable
to
what
we
mean
by
these
terms
in
latin
or
french
footnote
suffixed
articles
occur
also
in
danish
and
swedish
and
in
numerous
other
languages
the
nootka
element
for
in
the
house
differs
from
our
in
that
it
is
suffixed
and
can
not
occur
as
an
independent
word
nor
is
it
related
to
the
nootka
word
for
house
footnote
assuming
the
existence
of
a

firelet
footnote
the
nootka
diminutive
is
doubtless
more
of
a
an
element
of
nuance
than
our
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
it
may
be
used
with
verbs
as
well
as
with
nouns
in
speaking
to
a
child
one
is
likely
to
add
the
diminutive
to
any
word
in
the
sentence
regardless
of
whether
there
is
an
inherent
diminutive
meaning
in
the
word
or
not
can
such
a
concept
as
that
of
plurality
ever
be
classified
with
the
more
material
concepts
of
group
ii
indeed
it
can
be
in
yana
the
third
person
of
the
verb
makes
no
formal
distinction
between
singular
and
plural
nevertheless
the
plural
concept
can
be
and
nearly
always
is
expressed
by
the
suffixing
of
an
element
to
the
radical
element
of
the
verb
it
burns
in
the
east
is
rendered
by
the
verb
they
burn
in
the
east
is
note
that
the
plural
affix
immediately
follows
the
radical
element
disconnecting
it
from
the
local
element
it
needs
no
labored
argument
to
prove
that
the
concept
of
plurality
is
here
hardly
less
concrete
than
that
of
location
in
the
east
and
that
the
yana
form
corresponds
in
feeling
not
so
much
to
our
they
burn
in

as
to
a
it
plurally
burns
in
the

an
expression
which
we
can
not
adequately
assimilate
for
lack
of
the
necessary
into
which
to
run
it
footnote
is
the
third
person
of
the
present
tense
east
is
an
affix
not
a
compounded
radical
element
but
can
we
go
a
step
farther
and
dispose
of
the
category
of
plurality
as
an
utterly
material
idea
one
that
would
make
of
books
a
plural
book
in
which
the
plural
like
the
white

falls
contentedly

our
many

are
obviously

we
could
say
many

several

we
can
say

the
plural

would
still
not
emerge
as
clearly
as
it
should
for
our
argument
many

several

contaminated
by
certain
notions
of
quantity
or
scale
that
are
not
essential
to
the
idea
of
plurality

we
must
turn
to
central

us

we
can
not

in

where
to
put
a

must

had
to
anticipate
much
that

the

a
whole

language
has
its
special
method
or
methods
of
binding
words
into
a
larger
unity
the
importance
of
these
methods
is
apt
to
vary
with
the
complexity

more
synthetic
the

more
clearly
the

is
there
for
looking
beyond

no
outside
help

the

as

practically
the

it
can
only
be

conceived
as

out

other

it
is
not
so

a
syntactic
waif

its

abominably

another
in
that

the
latin

with
the
assurance
of
its
individual
members
the
english
word
needs
the
prompting
of
its
fellows
roughly
speaking
to
be
sure
and
yet
to
say
that
a
sufficiently
elaborate
compensates
for
external
syntactic
methods

perilously
close
to
begging
the
question
the

of
the

related
to
each

in
a
specific
way
and
follow
each
other
in
a
rigorously
determined
sequence
this
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
a
word
which
consists
of
more
than
a
radical
element
is
a
crystallization
of
a
sentence
or
of
some
portion
of
a
sentence

roughly
the
psychological
equivalent
of
a
form

breaking
down
then
the
wall

may
ask
what
at
last
analysis
are
the
fundamental
methods
of
relating
word
to
word
and
element
to
element
in
short
of
passing
from
the
isolated
notions
symbolized
by
each
word
and
by
each
element
to
the
unified
proposition
that
corresponds
to
a
thought
footnote
ultimately
also
historical
say
act
that
one
the
answer
is
simple
and
is
implied
in
the
preceding
remarks
the
most
fundamental
and
the
most
powerful
of
all
relating
methods
is
the
method
of
order
let
us
think
of
some
more
or
less
concrete
idea
say
a
color
and
set
down
its
symbol
of
another
concrete
idea
say
a
person

object
setting
down
its
symbol
finally
of
a
third
concrete
idea
say
an
action
setting
down
its
symbol
it
is
hardly
possible
to
set
down
these
three
symbols

without
relating
them
in
some
way
for
example
the
red
dog
run
s
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
state
that
the
proposition
has
always
grown
up
in
this
analytic
manner
merely
that
the
very
process
of
juxtaposing
concept
to
concept
symbol
to

forces
some
kind
of
relational
feeling

nothing

to
the
attributive
relation
of

some
kind
of

among
themselves

are
attracted
to
each

greater
or
in

it
is
presumably
this

ultimately

solidified

that
we
have
studied
as
complex
words
they
are
in
all
likelihood
nothing
but
sequences
that
have
shrunk
together
and
away
from
other
sequences
or
isolated
elements
in
the
flow
of
speech
while
they
are
fully
alive
in
other
words
while
they
are
functional
at
every
point
they
can
keep
themselves
at
a
psychological
distance
from
their
neighbors
as
they
gradually
lose
much
of
their
life
they
fall
back
into
the
embrace
of
the
sentence
as
a
whole
and
the
sequence
of
independent
words
regains
the
importance
it
had
in
part
transferred
to
the
crystallized
groups
of
elements
speech
is
thus
constantly
tightening
and
loosening
its
sequences
in
its
highly
integrated
forms
latin

the
energy
of
sequence
is
largely
locked
up
in
complex
word
formations
it
becomes
transformed
into
a
kind
of
potential
energy
that
may
not
be
released
for
millennia
in
its
more
analytic
forms
chinese
english
this
energy
is
mobile
ready
to
hand
for
such
service
as
we
demand
of
it
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
stress
has
frequently
played
a
controlling
influence
in
the
formation
of
or
complex
words
out
of
certain
sequences
in
the
sentence
such
an
english
word
as
is
merely
an
old
sequence
against
stand
in
which
the
unstressed
adverb
was
permanently
drawn
to
the
following
verb
and
lost
its
independence
as
a
significant
element
in
the
same
way
french
futures
of
the
type
i
shall
go
are
but
the
resultants
of
a
coalescence
of
originally
independent
words
under
the
influence
of
a
unifying
accent
but
stress
has
done
more
than
articulate
or
unify
sequences
that
in
their
own
right
imply
a
syntactic
relation
stress
is
the
most
natural
means
at
our
disposal
to
emphasize
a
linguistic
contrast
to
indicate
the
major
element
in
a
sequence
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
accent
too
no
less
than
sequence
may
serve
as
the
unaided
symbol
of
certain
relations
such
a
contrast
as
that
of
one
who
goes
between
and
go
may
be
of
quite
secondary
origin
in
english
but
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
analogous
distinctions
have
prevailed
at
all
times
in
linguistic
history
a
sequence
like
might
imply
some
type
of
relation
in
which
qualifies
the
following
word
hence
a
seeing
man
or
a
seen
or
visible
man
or
is
its
predication
hence
the
man
sees
or
the
man
is
seen
while
a
sequence
like
might
indicate
that
the
accented
word
in
some
way
limits
the
application
of
the
first
say
as
direct
object
hence
to
see
a
man
or
he
sees
the
man
such
alternations
of
relation
as
symbolized
by
varying
stresses
are
important
and
frequent
in
a
number
of
languages

footnote
in

no
less
than
in
english
it
is
a
somewhat
venturesome
and
yet
not
an
altogether
unreasonable
speculation
that
sees
in
word
order
and
stress
the
primary
methods
for
the
expression
of
all
syntactic
relations
and
looks
upon
the
present
relational
value
of
specific
words
and
elements
as
but
a
secondary
condition
due
to
a
transfer
of
values
thus
we
may
surmise
that
the
latin
of
words
like
and
did
not
originally
denote
that
woman
master
and
citizen
were
objectively
related
to
the
verb
of
the
proposition
but
indicated
something
far
more
concrete
that
the
objective
relation
was
merely
implied
by
the
position
or
accent
of
the
word
radical
element
immediately
preceding
the
and
that
gradually
as
its
more
concrete
significance
faded
away
it
took
over
a
syntactic
function
that
did
not
originally
belong
to
it
this
sort
of
evolution
by
transfer
is
traceable
in
many
instances
thus
the
in
an
english
phrase
like
the
law
of
the
land
is
now
as
colorless
in
content
as
purely
a
relational
indicator
as
the
genitive
suffix
in
the
latin
the
law
of
the
city
we
know
however
that
it
was
originally
an
adverb
of
considerable
concreteness
of
meaning
away
moving
from
and
that
the
syntactic
relation
was
originally
expressed
by
the
case
form
of
the
second
noun
as
the
case
form
lost
its
vitality
the
adverb
took
over
its
function
if
we
are
actually
justified
in
assuming
that
the
expression
of
all
syntactic
relations
is
ultimately
traceable
to
these
two
unavoidable
dynamic
features
of
speech

very
likely
pitch
should
be
understood
along
with

there
is
a
special
method
for
the
expression
of
relations
that
has
been
so
often
evolved
in
the
history
of
language
that
we
must
glance
at
it
for
a
moment
this
is
the
method
of
concord
or
of
like
signaling
it
is
based
on
the
same
principle
as
the
password
or
label
all
persons
or
objects
that
answer
to
the
same
or
that
bear
the
same
imprint
are
thereby
stamped
as
somehow
related
it
makes
little
difference
once
they
are
so
stamped
where
they
are
to
be
found
or
how
they
behave
themselves
they
are
known
to
belong
together
we
are
familiar
with
the
principle
of
concord
in
latin
and
greek
many
of
us
have
been
struck
by
such
relentless
rhymes
as
ilium
bonum
i
saw
that
good
master
or
dearum
of
which
stern
goddesses
not
that
whether
in
the
form
of
rhyme
or
of
alliteration
is
necessary
to
concord
though
in
its
most
typical
and
original
forms
concord
is
nearly
always
accompanied
by
sound
repetition
the
essence
of
the
principle
is
simply
this
that
words
elements
that
belong
together
particularly
if
they
are
syntactic
equivalents
or
are
related
in
like
fashion
to
another
word
or
element
are
outwardly
marked
by
the
same
or
functionally
equivalent
affixes
the
application
of
the
principle
varies
considerably
according
to
the
genius
of
the
particular
language
in
latin
and
greek
for
instance
there
is
concord
between
noun
and
qualifying
word
adjective
or
demonstrative
as
regards
gender
number
and
case
between
verb
and
subject
only
as
regards
number
and
no
concord
between
verb
and
object
footnote
as
in
bantu
or
chinook
in
chinook
there
is
a
more
concord
between
noun
whether
subject
or
object
and
verb
every
noun
is
classified
according
to
five
categories
masculine
feminine
neuter
dual
and
plural
woman
is
feminine
sand
is
neuter
table
is
masculine
if
therefore
i
wish
to
say
the
woman
put
the
sand
on
the
table
i
must
place
in
the
verb
certain
class
or
gender
prefixes
that
accord
with
corresponding
noun
prefixes
the
sentence
reads
then
the
fem
she
fem
neut
masc
the
neut
the
if
sand
is
qualified
as
much
and
table
as
large
these
new
ideas
are
expressed
as
abstract
nouns
each
with
its
inherent
much
is
neuter
or
feminine
large
is
masculine
and
with
a
possessive
prefix
referring
to
the
qualified
noun
adjective
thus
calls
to
noun
noun
to
verb
the
woman
put
much
sand
on
the
large
table
therefore
takes
the
form
the
fem
she
fem
neut
masc
the
fem
neut
the
neut
the
masc
masc
the
the
classification
of
table
as
masculine
is
thus
three
times
insisted
on
in
the
noun
in
the
adjective
and
in
the
verb
in
the
bantu
languages
the
principle
of
concord
works
very
much
as
in
chinook
in
them
also
nouns
are
classified
into
a
number
of
categories
and
are
brought
into
relation
with
adjectives
demonstratives
relative
pronouns
and
verbs
by
means
of
prefixed
elements
that
call
off
the
class
and
make
up
a
complex
system
of
concordances
in
such
a
sentence
as
that
fierce
lion
who
came
here
is
dead
the
class
of
lion
which
we
may
call
the
animal
class
would
be
referred
to
by
concording
prefixes
no
less
than
six
times
with
the
demonstrative
that
the
qualifying
adjective
the
noun
itself
the
relative
pronoun
the
subjective
prefix
to
the
verb
of
the
relative
clause
and
the
subjective
prefix
to
the
verb
of
the
main
clause
is
dead
we
recognize
in
this
insistence
on
external
clarity
of
reference
the
same
spirit
as
moves
in
the
more
familiar
bonum
footnote
perhaps
better
general
the
chinook
neuter
may
refer
to
persons
as
well
as
things
and
may
also
be
used
as
a
plural

in

a
great
number
of
inanimate

impressive
to
observe
how
the
human
mind
has
arrived
at
the
same
form
of
expression
in
two
such
historically
unconnected
regions
psychologically
the
methods
of
sequence
and
accent
lie
at
the
opposite
pole
to
that
of
concord
where
they
are
all
for
implication
for
subtlety
of
feeling
concord
is
impatient
of
the
least
ambiguity
but
must
have
its
tags
at
every
turn
concord
tends
to
dispense
with
order
in
latin
and
chinook
the
independent
words
are
free
in
position
less
so
in
bantu
in
both
chinook
and
bantu
however
the
methods
of
concord
and
order
are
equally
important
for
the
differentiation
of
subject
and
object
as
the
classifying
verb
prefixes
refer
to
subject
object
or
indirect
object
according
to
the
relative
position
they
occupy
these
examples
again
bring
home
to
us
the
significant
fact
that
at
some
point
or
other
order
asserts
itself
in
every
language
as
the
most
fundamental
of
relating
principles
the
observant
reader
has
probably
been
surprised
that
all
this
time
we
have
had
so
little
to
say
of
the
parts
of
speech
the
reason
for
this
is
not
far
to
seek
our
conventional
classification
of
words
into
parts
of
speech
is
only
a
vague
wavering
approximation
to
a
consistently
worked
out
inventory
of
experience
we
imagine
to
begin
with
that
all
verbs
are
inherently
concerned
with
action
as
such
that
a
noun
is
the
name
of
some
definite
object
or
personality
that
can
be
pictured
by
the
mind
that
all
qualities
are
necessarily
expressed
by
a
definite
group
of
words
to
which
we
may
appropriately
apply
the
term
adjective
as
soon
as
we
test
our
vocabulary
we
discover
that
the
parts
of
speech
are
far
from
corresponding
to
so
simple
an
analysis
of
reality
we
say
it
is
red
and
define
red
as
a
or
adjective
we
should
consider
it
strange
to
think
of
an
equivalent
of
is
red
in
which
the
whole
predication
adjective
and
verb
of
being
is
conceived
of
as
a
verb
in
precisely
the
same
way
in
which
we
think
of
extends
or
lies
or
sleeps
as
a
verb
yet
as
soon
as
we
give
the
durative
notion
of
being
red
an
inceptive
or
transitional
turn
we
can
avoid
the
parallel
form
it
becomes
red
it
turns
red
and
say
it
reddens
no
one
denies
that
reddens
is
as
good
a
verb
as
sleeps
or
even
walks
yet
it
is
red
is
related
to
it
reddens
very
much
as
is
he
stands
to
he
stands
up
or
he
rises
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
english
or
of
general
idiom
that
we
can
not
say
it
reds
in
the
sense
of
it
is
red
there
are
hundreds
of
languages
that
can
indeed
there
are
many
that
can
express
what
we
should
call
an
adjective
only
by
making
a
participle
out
of
a
verb
red
in
such
languages
is
merely
a
derivative
being
red
as
our
sleeping
or
walking
are
derivatives
of
primary
verbs
just
as
we
can
verbify
the
idea
of
a
quality
in
such
cases
as
reddens
so
we
can
represent
a
quality
or
an
action
to
ourselves
as
a
thing
we
speak
of
the
height
of
a
building
or
the
fall
of
an
apple
quite
as
though
these
ideas
were
parallel
to
the
roof
of
a
building
or
the
skin
of
an
apple
forgetting
that
the
nouns
have
not
ceased
to
indicate
a
quality
and
an
act
when
we
have
made
them
speak
with
the
accent
of
mere
objects
and
just
as
there
are
languages
that
make
verbs
of
the
great
mass
of
adjectives
so
there
are
others
that
make
nouns
of
them
in
chinook
as
we
have
seen
the
big
table
is
in
tibetan
the
same
idea
may
be
expressed
by
the
table
of
bigness
very
much
as
we
may
say
a
man
of
wealth
instead
of
a
rich
man
but
are
there
not
certain
ideas
that
it
is
impossible
to
render
except
by
way
of
such
and
such
parts
of
speech
what
can
be
done
with
the
to
of
he
came
to
the
house
well
we
can
say
he
reached
the
house
and
dodge
the
preposition
altogether
giving
the
verb
a
nuance
that
absorbs
the
idea
of
local
relation
carried
by
the
to
but
let
us
insist
on
giving
independence
to
this
idea
of
local
relation
must
we
not
then
hold
to
the
preposition
no
we
can
make
a
noun
of
it
we
can
say
something
like
he
reached
the
proximity
of
the
house
or
he
reached
the
instead
of
saying
he
looked
into
the
glass
we
may
say
he
scrutinized
the
such
expressions
are
stilted
in
english
because
they
do
not
easily
fit
into
our
formal
grooves
but
in
language
after
language
we
find
that
local
relations
are
expressed
in
just
this
way
the
local
relation
is
nominalized
and
so
we
might
go
on
examining
the
various
parts
of
speech
and
showing
how
they
not
merely
grade
into
each
other
but
are
to
an
astonishing
degree
actually
convertible
into
each
other
the
upshot
of
such
an
examination
would
be
to
feel
convinced
that
the
part
of
speech
reflects
not
so
much
our
intuitive
analysis
of
reality
as
our
ability
to
compose
that
reality
into
a
variety
of
formal
patterns
a
part
of
speech
outside
of
the
limitations
of
syntactic
form
is
but
a
will
o
the
wisp
for
this
reason
no
logical
scheme
of
the
parts
of
speech
their
number
nature
and
necessary
confines
is
of
the
slightest
interest
to
the
linguist
each
language
has
its
own
scheme
everything
depends
on
the
formal
demarcations
which
it
recognizes
yet
we
must
not
be
too
destructive
it
is
well
to
remember
that
speech
consists
of
a
series
of
propositions
there
must
be
something
to
talk
about
and
something
must
be
said
about
this
subject
of
discourse
once
it
is
selected
this
distinction
is
of
such
fundamental
importance
that
the
vast
majority
of
languages
have
emphasized
it
by
creating
some
sort
of
formal
barrier
between
the
two
terms
of
the
proposition
the
subject
of
discourse
is
a
noun
as
the
most
common
subject
of
discourse
is
either
a
person
or
a
thing
the
noun
clusters
about
concrete
concepts
of
that
order
as
the
thing
predicated
of
a
subject
is
generally
an
activity
in
the
widest
sense
of
the
word
a
passage
from
one
moment
of
existence
to
another
the
form
which
has
been
set
aside
for
the
business
of
predicating
in
other
words
the
verb
clusters
about
concepts
of
activity
no

the

are

that
they

we
feel
to

possible

there
are
strictly

types
of
linguistic
structure
so
far
in
dealing
with
linguistic
form
we
have
been
concerned
only
with
single
words
and
with
the
relations
of
words
in
sentences
we
have
not
envisaged
whole
languages
as
conforming
to
this
or
that
general
type
incidentally
we
have
observed
that
one
language
runs
to
synthesis
where
another
contents
itself
with
a
more
analytic
handling
of
its
elements
or
that
in
one
language
syntactic
relations
appear
pure
which
in
another
are
combined
with
certain
other
notions
that
have
something
concrete
about
them
however
abstract
they
may
be
felt
to
be
in
practice
in
this
way
we
may
have
obtained
some
inkling
of
what
is
meant
when
we
speak
of
the
general
form
of
a
language
for
it
must
be
obvious
to
any
one
who
has
thought
about
the
question
at
all
or
who
has
felt
something
of
the
spirit
of
a
foreign
language
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
basic
plan
a
certain
cut
to
each
language
this
type
or
plan
or
structural
genius
of
the
language
is
something
much
more
fundamental
much
more
pervasive
than
any
single
feature
of
it
that
we
can
mention
nor
can
we
gain
an
adequate
idea
of
its
nature
by
a
mere
recital
of
the
sundry
facts
that
make
up
the
grammar
of
the
language
when
we
pass
from
latin
to
russian
we
feel
that
it
is
approximately
the
same
horizon
that
bounds
our
view
even
though
the
near
familiar
landmarks
have
changed
when
we
come
to
english
we
seem
to
notice
that
the
hills
have
dipped
down
a
little
yet
we
recognize
the
general
lay
of
the
land
and
when
we
have
arrived
at
chinese
it
is
an
utterly
different
sky
that
is
looking
down
upon
us
we
can
translate
these
metaphors
and
say
that
all
languages
differ
from
one
another
but
that
certain
ones
differ
far
more
than
others
this
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
it
is
possible
to
group
them
into
morphological
types
strictly
speaking
we
know
in
advance
that
it
is
impossible
to
set
up
a
limited
number
of
types
that
would
do
full
justice
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
thousands
of
languages
and
dialects
spoken
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
like
all
human
institutions
speech
is
too
variable
and
too
elusive
to
be
quite
safely
ticketed
even
if
we
operate
with
a
minutely
subdivided
scale
of
types
we
may
be
quite
certain
that
many
of
our
languages
will
need
trimming
before
they
fit
to
get
them
into
the
scheme
at
all
it
will
be
necessary
to
overestimate
the
significance
of
this
or
that
feature
or
to
ignore
for
the
time
being
certain
contradictions
in
their
mechanism
does
the
difficulty
of
classification
prove
the
uselessness
of
the
task
i
do
not
think
so
it
would
be
too
easy
to
relieve
ourselves
of
the
burden
of
constructive
thinking
and
to
take
the
standpoint
that
each
language
has
its
unique
history
therefore
its
unique
structure
such
a
standpoint
expresses
only
a
half
truth
just
as
similar
social
economic
and
religious
institutions
have
grown
up
in
different
parts
of
the
world
from
distinct
historical
antecedents
so
also
languages
traveling
along
different
roads
have
tended
to
converge
toward
similar
forms
moreover
the
historical
study
of
language
has
proven
to
us
beyond
all
doubt
that
a
language
changes
not
only
gradually
but
consistently
that
it
moves
unconsciously
from
one
type
towards
another
and
that
analogous
trends
are
observable
in
remote
quarters
of
the
globe
from
this
it
follows
that
broadly
similar
morphologies
must
have
been
reached
by
unrelated
languages
independently
and
frequently
in
assuming
the
existence
of
comparable
types
therefore
we
are
not
gainsaying
the
individuality
of
all
historical
processes
we
are
merely
affirming
that
back
of
the
face
of
history
are
powerful
drifts
that
move
language
like
other
social
products
to
balanced
patterns
in
other
words
to
types
as
linguists
we
shall
be
content
to
realize
that
there
are
these
types
and
that
certain
processes
in
the
life
of
language
tend
to
modify
them
why
similar
types
should
be
formed
just
what
is
the
nature
of
the
forces
that
make
them
and
dissolve
them
these
questions
are
more
easily
asked
than
answered
perhaps
the
psychologists
of
the
future
will
be
able
to
give
us
the
ultimate
reasons
for
the
formation
of
linguistic
types
when
it
comes
to
the
actual
task
of
classification
we
find
that
we
have
no
easy
road
to
travel
various
classifications
have
been
suggested
and
they
all
contain
elements
of
value
yet
none
proves
satisfactory
they
do
not
so
much
enfold
the
known
languages
in
their
embrace
as
force
them
down
into
narrow
seats
the
difficulties
have
been
of
various
kinds
first
and
foremost
it
has
been
difficult
to
choose
a
point
of
view
on
what
basis
shall
we
classify
a
language
shows
us
so
many
facets
that
we
may
well
be
puzzled
and
is
one
point
of
view
sufficient
secondly
it
is
dangerous
to
generalize
from
a
small
number
of
selected
languages
to
take
as
the
sum
total
of
our
material
latin
arabic
turkish
chinese
and
perhaps
eskimo
or
sioux
as
an
afterthought
is
to
court
disaster
we
have
no
right
to
assume
that
a
sprinkling
of
exotic
types
will
do
to
supplement
the
few
languages
nearer
home
that
we
are
more
immediately
interested
in
thirdly
the
strong
craving
for
a
simple
formula
has
been
the
undoing
of
linguists
there
is
something
irresistible
about
a
method
of
classification
that
starts
with
two
poles
exemplified
say
by
chinese
and
latin
clusters
what
it
conveniently
can
about
these
poles
and
throws
everything
else
into
a
transitional
type
hence
has
arisen
the
still
popular
classification
of
languages
into
an
isolating
group
an
agglutinative
group
and
an
inflective
group
sometimes
the
languages
of
the
american
indians
are
made
to
straggle
along
as
an
uncomfortable
polysynthetic
to
the
agglutinative
languages
there
is
justification
for
the
use
of
all
of
these
terms
though
not
perhaps
in
quite
the
spirit
in
which
they
are
commonly
employed
in
any
case
it
is
very
difficult
to
assign
all
known
languages
to
one
or
other
of
these
groups
the
more
so
as
they
are
not
mutually
exclusive
a
language
may
be
both
agglutinative
and
inflective
or
inflective
and
polysynthetic
or
even
polysynthetic
and
isolating
as
we
shall
see
a
little
later
on
footnote
if
possible
a
triune
formula
there
is
a
fourth
reason
why
the
classification
of
languages
has
generally
proved
a
fruitless
undertaking
it
is
probably
the
most
powerful
deterrent
of
all
to
clear
thinking
this
is
the
evolutionary
prejudice
which
instilled
itself
into
the
social
sciences
towards
the
middle
of
the
last
century
and
which
is
only
now
beginning
to
abate
its
tyrannical
hold
on
our
mind
intermingled
with
this
scientific
prejudice
and
largely
anticipating
it
was
another
a
more
human
one
the
vast
majority
of
linguistic
theorists
themselves
spoke
languages
of
a
certain
type
of
which
the
most
fully
developed
varieties
were
the
latin
and
greek
that
they
had
learned
in
their
childhood
it
was
not
difficult
for
them
to
be
persuaded
that
these
familiar
languages
represented
the
highest
development
that
speech
had
yet
attained
and
that
all
other
types
were
but
steps
on
the
way
to
this
beloved
inflective
type
whatever
conformed
to
the
pattern
of
sanskrit
and
greek
and
latin
and
german
was
accepted
as
expressive
of
the
highest
whatever
departed
from
it
was
frowned
upon
as
a
shortcoming
or
was
at
best
an
interesting
aberration
now
any
classification
that
starts
with
preconceived
values
or
that
works
up
to
sentimental
satisfactions
is
as
unscientific
a
linguist
that
insists
on
talking
about
the
latin
type
of
morphology
as
though
it
were
necessarily
the
mark
of
linguistic
development
is
like
the
zoölogist
that
sees
in
the
organic
world
a
huge
conspiracy
to
evolve
the
or
the
jersey
cow
language
in
its
fundamental
forms
is
the
symbolic
expression
of
human
intuitions
these
may
shape
themselves
in
a
hundred
ways
regardless
of
the
material
advancement
or
backwardness
of
the
people
that
handle
the
forms
of
which
it
need
hardly
be
said
they
are
in
the
main
unconscious
if
therefore
we
wish
to
understand
language
in
its
true
inwardness
we
must
disabuse
our
minds
of
preferred
values
and
accustom
ourselves
to
look
upon
english
and
hottentot
with
the
same
cool
yet
interested
detachment
footnote
one
celebrated
american
writer
on
culture
and
language
delivered
himself
of
the
dictum
that
estimable
as
the
speakers
of
agglutinative
languages
might
be
it
was
nevertheless
a
crime
for
an
inflecting
woman
to
marry
an
agglutinating
man
tremendous
spiritual
values
were
evidently
at
stake
champions
of
the
inflective

are
wont
to
glory
in
the
very
irrationalities
of
latin
and
greek
except
when
it
suits
them
to
emphasize
their
profoundly
logical
character
yet
the
sober
logic
of
turkish
or
chinese
leaves
them
cold
the
glorious
irrationalities
and
formal
complexities
of
many
savage

have
no

footnote
i
have
in
mind
valuations
of
form
as
such
whether
or
not
a
language
has
a
large
and
useful
vocabulary
is
another
matter
the
actual
size
of
a
vocabulary
at
a
given
time
is
not
a
thing
of
real
interest
to
the
linguist
as
all
languages
have
the
resources
at
their
disposal
for
the
creation
of
new
words
should
need
for
them
arise
furthermore
we
are
not
in
the
least
concerned
with
whether
or
not
a
language
is
of
great
practical
value
or
is
the
medium
of
a
great
culture
all
these
considerations
important
from
other
standpoints
have
nothing
to
do
with
form
value
we
come
back
to
our
first
difficulty
what
point
of
view
shall
we
adopt
for
our
classification
after
all
that
we
have
said
about
grammatical
form
in
the
preceding
chapter
it
is
clear
that
we
can
not
now
make
the
distinction
between
form
languages
and
formless
languages
that
used
to
appeal
to
some
of
the
older
writers
every
language
can
and
must
express
the
fundamental
syntactic
relations
even
though
there
is
not
a
single
affix
to
be
found
in
its
vocabulary
we
conclude
that
every
language
is
a
form
language
aside
from
the
expression
of
pure
relation
a
language
may
of
course
be
formless
formless
that
is
in
the
mechanical
and
rather
superficial
sense
that
it
is
not
encumbered
by
the
use
of
elements
the
attempt
has
sometimes
been
made
to
formulate
a
distinction
on
the
basis
of
inner
form
chinese
for
instance
has
no
formal
elements
pure
and
simple
no
outer
form
but
it
evidences
a
keen
sense
of
relations
of
the
difference
between
subject
and
object
attribute
and
predicate
and
so
on
in
other
words
it
has
an
inner
form
in
the
same
sense
in
which
latin
possesses
it
though
it
is
outwardly
formless
where
latin
is
outwardly
formal
on
the
other
hand
there
are
supposed
to
be
languages
which
have
no
true
grasp
of
the
fundamental
relations
but
content
themselves
with
the
more
or
less
minute
expression
of
material
ideas
sometimes
with
an
exuberant
display
of
outer
form
leaving
the
pure
relations
to
be
merely
inferred
from
the
context
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
this
supposed
inner
formlessness
of
certain
languages
is
an
illusion
it
may
well
be
that
in
these
languages
the
relations
are
not
expressed
in
as
immaterial
a
way
as
in
chinese
or
even
as
in
latin
or
that
the
principle
of
order
is
subject
to
greater
fluctuations
than
in
chinese
or
that
a
tendency
to
complex
derivations
relieves
the
language
of
the
necessity
of
expressing
certain
relations
as
explicitly
as
a
more
analytic
language
would
have
them
expressed
all
this
does
not
mean
that
the
languages
in
question
have
not
a
true
feeling
for
the
fundamental
relations
we
shall
therefore
not
be
able
to
use
the
notion
of
inner
formlessness
except
in
the
greatly
modified
sense
that
syntactic
relations
may
be
fused
with
notions
of
another
order
to
this
criterion
of
classification
we
shall
have
to
return

little
later

as
we
have

the
syntactic

by

free
from
an
alloy

very
much
as

french

more
justifiable
would
be
a
classification
according
to
the
formal
processes
most
typically
developed
in
the
language
those
languages
that
always
identify
the
word
with
the
radical
element
would
be
set
off
as
an
isolating
group
against
such
as
either
affix

affixing
languages
or
possess
the
power
to
change
the
significance
of
the
radical
element
by
internal
changes
reduplication
vocalic
and
consonantal
change
changes
in
quantity
stress
and
pitch
the
latter
type
might
be
not
inaptly
termed
symbolic
languages
the
affixing
languages
would
naturally
subdivide
themselves
into
such
as
are
prevailingly
prefixing
like
bantu
or
tlingit
and
such
as
are
mainly
or
entirely
suffixing
like
eskimo
or
algonkin
or
latin
there
are
two
serious
difficulties
with
this
fourfold
classification
isolating
prefixing
suffixing
symbolic
in
the
first
place
most
languages
fall
into
more
than
one
of
these
groups
the
semitic
languages
for
instance
are
prefixing
suffixing
and
symbolic
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
the
second
place
the
classification
in
its
bare
form
is
superficial
it
would
throw
together
languages
that
differ
utterly
in
spirit
merely
because
of
a
certain
external
formal
resemblance
there
is
clearly
a
world
of
difference
between
a
prefixing
language
like
cambodgian
which
limits
itself
so
far
as
its
prefixes
and
infixes
are
concerned
to
the
expression
of
derivational
concepts
and
the
bantu
languages
in
which
the
prefixed
elements
have
a
significance
as
symbols
of
syntactic
relations
the
classification
has
much
greater
value
if
it
is
taken
to
refer
to
the
expression
of
relational
concepts
alone
in
this
modified
form
we
shall
return
to
it
as
a
subsidiary
criterion
we
shall
find
that
the
terms
isolating
affixing
and
symbolic
have
a
real
value
but
instead
of
distinguishing
between
prefixing
and
suffixing
languages
we
shall
find
that
it
is
of
superior
interest
to
make
another
distinction
one
that
is
based
on
the
relative
firmness
with
which
the
affixed
elements
are
united
with
the
core
of
the

is

a

connection
between

in
spite
of
my
reluctance
to
emphasize
the
difference
between
a
prefixing
and
a
suffixing
language
i
feel
that
there
is
more
involved
in
this
difference
than
linguists
have
generally
recognized
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
rather
important
psychological
distinction
between
a
language
that
settles
the
formal
status
of
a
radical
element
before
announcing
it
and
this
in
effect
is
what
such
languages
as
tlingit
and
chinook
and
bantu
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
and
one
that
begins
with
the
concrete
nucleus
of
a

something
diagrammatic

about

the

a
method
of

afterthoughts
in
the
more
highly
wrought
prefixing
languages
the
word
is
apt
to
affect
us
as
a
crystallization
of
floating
elements
the
words
of
the
typical
suffixing
languages
turkish
eskimo
nootka
are
determinative
formations
each
added
element
determining
the
form
of
the
whole
anew
it
is
so
difficult
in
practice
to
apply
these
elusive
yet
important
distinctions
that
an
elementary
study
has
no
recourse
but
to
ignore
them
there
is
another
very
useful
set
of
distinctions
that
can
be
made
but
these
too
must
not
be
applied
exclusively
or
our
classification
will
again
be
superficial
i
refer
to
the
notions
of
analytic
synthetic
and
polysynthetic
the
terms
explain
themselves
an
analytic
language
is
one
that
either
does
not
combine
concepts
into
single
words
at
all
chinese
or
does
so
economically
english
french
in
an
analytic
language
the
sentence
is
always
of
prime
importance
the
word
is
of
minor
interest
in
a
synthetic
language
latin
arabic
finnish
the
concepts
cluster
more
thickly
the
words
are
more
richly
chambered
but
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
whole
to
keep
the
range
of
concrete
significance
in
the
single
word
down
to
a
moderate
compass
a
polysynthetic
language
as
its
name
implies
is
more
than
ordinarily
synthetic
the
elaboration
of
the
word
is
extreme
concepts
which
we
should
never
dream
of
treating
in
a
subordinate
fashion
are
symbolized
by
derivational
affixes
or
symbolic
changes
in
the
radical
element
while
the
more
abstract
notions
including
the
syntactic
relations
may
also
be
conveyed
by
the
word
a
polysynthetic
language
illustrates
no
principles
that
are
not
already
exemplified
in
the
more
familiar
synthetic
languages
it
is
related
to
them
very
much
as
a
synthetic
language
is
related
to
our
own
analytic
english
the
three
terms
are
purely
quantitative
and
relative
that
is
a
language
may
be
analytic
from
one
standpoint
synthetic
from
another
i
believe
the
terms
are
more
useful
in
defining
certain
drifts
than
as
absolute
counters
it
is
often
illuminating
to
point
out
that
a
language
has
been
becoming
more
and
more
analytic
in
the
course
of
its
history
or
that
it
shows
signs
of
having
crystallized
from
a
simple
analytic
base
into
a
highly
synthetic
form
footnote
english
however
is
only
analytic
in
tendency
relatively
to
french
it
is
still
fairly
synthetic
at
least
in
certain
aspects
footnote
the
former
process
is
demonstrable
for
english
french
danish
tibetan
chinese
and
a
host
of
other
languages
the
latter
tendency
may
be
proven
i
believe
for
a
number
of
american
indian
languages
chinook
navaho
underneath
their
present
moderately
polysynthetic
form
is
discernible
an
analytic
base
that
in
the
one
case
may
be
roughly
described
as
in
the
other
we
now
come
to
the
difference
between
an
inflective
and
an
agglutinative
language
as
i
have
already
remarked
the
distinction
is
a
useful
even
a
necessary
one
but
it
has
been
generally
obscured
by
a
number
of
irrelevancies
and
by
the
unavailing
effort
to
make
the
terms
cover
all
languages
that
are
not
like
chinese
of
a
definitely
isolating
cast
the
meaning
that
we
had
best
assign
to
the
term
inflective
can
be
gained
by
considering
very
briefly
what
are
some
of
the
basic
features
of
latin
and
greek
that
have
been
looked
upon
as
peculiar
to
the
inflective
languages
first
of
all
they
are
synthetic
rather
than
analytic
this
does
not
help
us
much
relatively
to
many
another
language
that
resembles
them
in
broad
structural
respects
latin
and
greek
are
not
notably
synthetic
on
the
other
hand
their
modern
descendants
italian
and
modern
greek
while
far
more
analytic
than
they
have
not
departed
so
widely
in
structural
outlines
as
to
warrant
their
being
put
in
a
distinct
major
group
an
inflective
language
we
must
insist
may
be
analytic
synthetic
or
polysynthetic
footnote
this
applies
more
particularly
to
the
romance
group
italian
spanish
portuguese
french
roumanian
modern
greek
is
not
so
clearly
analytic
latin
and
greek
are
mainly
affixing
in
their
method
with
the
emphasis
heavily
on
suffixing
the
agglutinative
languages
are
just
as
typically
affixing
as
they
some
among
them
favoring
prefixes
others
running
to
the
use
of
suffixes
affixing
alone
does
not
define
inflection
possibly
everything
depends
on
just
what
kind
of
affixing
we
have
to
deal
with
if
we
compare
our
english
words
and
with
such
words
as
and
we
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
by
a
notable
difference
in
the
affixing
technique
of
the
two
sets
the
and
are
affixed
quite
mechanically
to
radical
elements
which
are
at
the
same
time
independent
words
they
are
in
no
sense
independently
significant
elements
but
they
convey
their
meaning
agentive
abstract
quality
with
unfailing
directness
their
use
is
simple
and
regular
and
we
should
have
no
difficulty
in
appending
them
to
any
verb
or
to
any
adjective
however
recent
in
origin
from
a
verb
we
may
form
the
noun
one
who
camouflages
from
an
adjective
proceeds
with
perfect
ease
the
noun
it
is
different
with
and
functionally
they
are
related
to
and
precisely
as
is
to
but
the
degree
of
coalescence
between
radical
element
and
affix
is
greater
radical
element
and
affix
while
measurably
distinct
can
not
be
torn
apart
quite
so
readily
as
could
the
and
of
the

not
the
typical
form
of
the
affix
compare
while
is
not
identical
with
we
may
designate
the
two
types
of
affixing
as
fusing
and
juxtaposing
the
juxtaposing
technique
we
may
call
an
agglutinative
one
if
we
like
is
the
fusing
technique
thereby
set
off
as
the
essence
of
inflection
i
am
afraid
that
we
have
not
yet
reached
our
goal
if
our
language
were
crammed
full
of
coalescences
of
the
type
of
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
used
the
plural
independently
of
verb
concord
books
like
book
or
book
like
books
the
personal
endings
independently
of
tense
book
like
book
or
book
like
book
and
the
pronouns
independently
of
case
see
like
sees
or
see
the
like
man
sees
we
should
hesitate
to
describe
it
as
inflective
the
mere
fact
of
fusion
does
not
seem
to
satisfy
us
as
a
clear
indication
of
the
inflective
process
there
are
indeed
a
large
number
of
languages
that
fuse
radical
element
and
affix
in
as
complete
and
intricate
a
fashion
as
one
could
hope
to
find
anywhere
without
thereby
giving
signs
of
that
particular
kind
of
formalism
that
marks
off
such
languages
as
latin
and
greek
as
inflective
what
is
true
of
fusion
is
equally
true
of
the
symbolic
processes
there
are
linguists
that
speak
of
alternations
like
and
as
though
they
represented
the
mark
of
inflection
a
kind
of
spiritualized
essence
of
pure
inflective
form
in
such
greek
forms
nevertheless
as
i
have
sent
as
contrasted
with
i
send
with
its
trebly
symbolic
change
of
the
radical
element
reduplicating
change
of
to
change
of
to
it
is
rather
the
peculiar
alternation
of
the
first
person
singular
of
the
perfect
with
the
of
the
present
that
gives
them
their
inflective
cast
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
than
to
imagine
that
symbolic
changes
of
the
radical
element
even
for
the
expression
of
such
abstract
concepts
as
those
of
number
and
tense
is
always
associated
with
the
syntactic
peculiarities
of
an
inflective
language
if
by
an
agglutinative
language
we
mean
one
that
affixes
according
to
the
juxtaposing
technique
then
we
can
only
say
that
there
are
hundreds
of
fusing
and
symbolic
languages
by
definition
that
are
for
all
that
quite
alien
in
spirit
to
the
inflective
type
of
latin
and
greek
we
can
call
such
languages
inflective
if
we
like
but
we
must
then
be
prepared
to
revise
radically
our
notion
of
inflective

to
the
paragraph
beginning
on

it
is
necessary
to
understand
that
fusion
of
the
radical
element
and
the
affix
may
be
taken
in
a
broader
psychological
sense
than
i
have

indicated

is
little
doubt
that
the

of
the

into
the
unified

would
be
felt
as
a
little
less
complete
than
it

feels
unconsciously
about
the

as

is
concerned
with
that
of

can
not
have
quite
so
definite
quite
so
autonomous
a
value
as
we
might
at
first
be
inclined
to
suppose
they
are
plural
elements
only
in
so
far
as
plurality
is
predicated
of
certain
selected
concepts
the
words
and
are
therefore
a
little
other
than
mechanical
combinations
of
the
symbol
of
a
thing
and
a
clear
symbol
of
plurality

psychological
uncertainty

haze
about

by

appropriated
by

about

rightly
claim

the

abstractive

the

the
state
of

away

should
have
moved
appreciably
nearer

agglutinative
pole

language
that
runs
to
synthesis

sort
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
example
of
the
ideal
agglutinative
type
particularly
if
the
concepts
expressed

how
weak
must
be
the
degree
of
fusion
between

the
nominalizing

verbalizing

is
apparent
from
the
fact
that
the

gained
by
analysis

a
word
ready
for
use

their
content

aside
further
from
the
degree
of
their
outer
phonetic
cohesion

a
psychological
independence

the

be
used
as

the

to
take

by

or
article
being
merely
lengthened
there
is
probably
also
a
change
in

this
of
course
is
of
the
very
essence
of
inflection
it
is
an
amusing
commentary
on
the
insufficiency
of
our
current
linguistic
classification
which
considers
inflective
and
isolating
as
worlds
asunder
that
modern
tibetan
may
be
not
inaptly
described
as
an
isolating
language
aside
from
such
examples
of
fusion
and
symbolism
as
the
foregoing
but
to
have
thus
defined
inflection
is
to
doubt
the
value
of
the
term
as
descriptive
of
a
major
class
why
emphasize
both
a
technique
and
a
particular
content
at
one
and
the
same
time
surely
we
should
be
clear
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
we
set
more
store
by
one
or
the
other
fusional
and
symbolic
contrast
with
agglutinative
which
is
not
on
a
par
with
inflective
at
all
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
fusional
and
symbolic
languages
that
do
not
express
relational
concepts
in
the
word
but
leave
them
to
the
sentence
and
are
we
not
to
distinguish
between
agglutinative
languages
that
express
these
same
concepts
in
the
word
in
so
far
and
those
that
do
not
we
dismissed
the
scale
analytic
synthetic
polysynthetic
as
too
merely
quantitative
for
our
purpose
isolating
affixing
symbolic
this
also
seemed
insufficient
for
the
reason
that
it
laid
too
much
stress
on
technical
externals
isolating
agglutinative
fusional
and
symbolic
is
a
preferable
scheme
but
still
skirts
the
external
we
shall
do
best
it
seems
to
me
to
hold
to
inflective
as
a
valuable
suggestion
for
a
broader
and
more
consistently
developed
scheme
as
a
hint
for
a
classification
based
on
the
nature
of
the
concepts
expressed
by
the
language
the
other
two
classifications
the
first
based
on
degree
of
synthesis
the
second
on
degree
of
fusion
may
be
retained
as
intercrossing
schemes
that
give
us
the
opportunity
to
subdivide
our
main
conceptual
types
it
is
well
to
recall
that
all
languages
must
needs
express
radical
concepts
group
i
and
relational
ideas
group
iv
of
the
two
other
large
groups
of
concepts
derivational
group
ii
and
mixed
relational
group
iii
both
may
be
absent
both
present
or
only
one
present
this
gives
us
at
once
a
simple
incisive
and
absolutely
inclusive
method
of
classifying
all
known
languages
they
are
a
such
as
express
only
concepts
of
groups
i
and
iv
in
other
words
languages
that
keep
the
syntactic
relations
pure
and
that
do
not
possess
the
power
to
modify
the
significance
of
their
radical
elements
by
means
of
affixes
or
internal
changes
we
may
call
these
or
more
tersely
these
are
the
languages
that
cut
most
to
the
bone
of
linguistic
expression

are

that
do
not
apart

such
mixture

we
may

in
these

in
those
of

all
or
most
of
the
relational
concepts
are
expressed
in
mixed
form

such
a
concept
as
that
of

for

can
not
be
expressed
without
simultaneously
involving
number

that
an
active

must
be
possessed
of
a

understood

absorb

theoretically
of

certain
relational

may
be
expressed
pure

mixed
but
in
practice
it
will
not
be
found
easy
to
make
the
distinction

the
line
between
types
c
and
d
can
not
be
very
sharply
drawn
it
is
a
matter
largely
of
degree
a
language
of
markedly
type
but
of
little
power
of
derivation
pure
and
simple
such
as
bantu
or
french
may
be
conveniently
put
into
type
c
even
though
it
is
not
devoid
of
a
number
of
derivational
affixes
roughly
speaking
languages
of
type
c
may
be
considered
as
highly
analytic
purified
forms
of
type
this
conceptual
classification
of
languages
i
must
repeat
does
not
attempt
to
take
account
of
the
technical
externals
of
language
it
answers
in
effect
two
fundamental
questions
concerning
the
translation
of
concepts
into
linguistic
symbols
does
the
language
in
the
first
place
keep
its
radical
concepts
pure
or
does
it
build
up
its
concrete
ideas
by
an
aggregation
of
inseparable
elements
types
a
and
c
types
b
and
d
and
in
the
second
place
does
it
keep
the
basic
relational
concepts
such
as
are
absolutely
unavoidable
in
the
ordering
of
a
proposition
free
of
an
admixture
of
the
concrete
or
not
types
a
and
b
types
c
and
d
the
second
question
it
seems
to
me
is
the
more
fundamental
of
the
two
we
can
therefore
simplify
our
classification
and
present
it
in
the
following
form
a
simple
languages
b
complex
ii
simple
languages
complex
the
classification
is
too
sweeping
and
too
broad
for
an
easy
descriptive
survey
of
the
many
varieties
of
human
speech
it
needs
to
be
amplified
each
of
the
types
a
b
c
d
may
be
subdivided
into
an
agglutinative
a
fusional
and
a
symbolic
according
to
the
prevailing
method
of
modification
of
the
radical
element
in
type
a
we
distinguish
in
addition
an
isolating
characterized
by
the
absence
of
all
affixes
and
modifications
of
the
radical
element
in
the
isolating
languages
the
syntactic
relations
are
expressed
by
the
position
of
the
words
in
the
sentence
this
is
also
true
of
many
languages
of
type
b
the
terms
agglutinative
fusional
and
symbolic
applying
in
their
case
merely
to
the
treatment
of
the
derivational
not
the
relational
concepts
such
languages
could
be
termed
and
this
brings
up
the
important
general
consideration
that
the
method
of
handling
one
group
of
concepts
need
not
in
the
least
be
identical
with
that
used
for
another
compound
terms
could
be
used
to
indicate
this
difference
if
desired
the
first
element
of
the
compound
referring
to
the
treatment
of
the
concepts
of
group
ii
the
second
to
that
of
the
concepts
of
groups
iii
and
iv
an
agglutinative
language
would
normally
be
taken
to
mean
one
that
agglutinates
all
of
its
affixed
elements
or
that
does
so
to
a
preponderating
extent
in
an
language
the
derivational
elements
are
agglutinated
perhaps
in
the
form
of
prefixes
while
the
relational
elements
pure
or
mixed
are
fused
with
the
radical
element
possibly
as
another
set
of
prefixes
following
the
first
set
or
in
the
form
of
suffixes
or
as
part
prefixes
and
part
suffixes
by
a
language
we
would
understand
one
that
fuses
its
derivational
elements
but
allows
a
greater
independence
to
those
that
indicate
relations
all
these
and
similar
distinctions
are
not
merely
theoretical
possibilities
they
can
be
abundantly
illustrated
from
the
descriptive
facts
of
linguistic
morphology
further
should
it
prove
desirable
to
insist
on
the
degree
of
elaboration
of
the
word
the
terms
analytic
synthetic
and
polysynthetic
can
be
added
as
descriptive
terms
it
goes
without
saying
that
languages
of
type
a
are
necessarily
analytic
and
that
languages
of
type
c
also
are
prevailingly
analytic
and
are
not
likely
to
develop
beyond
the
synthetic
stage
but
we
must
not
make
too
much
of
terminology
much
depends
on
the
relative
emphasis
laid
on
this
or
that
feature
or
point
of
view
the
method
of
classifying
languages
here
developed
has
this
great
advantage
that
it
can
be
refined
or
simplified
according
to
the
needs
of
a
particular
discussion
the
degree
of
synthesis
may
be
entirely
ignored
fusion
and
symbolism
may
often
be
combined
with
advantage
under
the
head
of
fusion
even
the
difference
between
agglutination
and
fusion
may
if
desired
be
set
aside
as
either
too
difficult
to
draw
or
as
irrelevant
to
the
issue
languages
after
all
are
exceedingly
complex
historical
structures
it
is
of
less
importance
to
put
each
language
in
a
neat
than
to
have
evolved
a
flexible
method
which
enables
us
to
place
it
from
two
or
three
independent
standpoints
relatively
to
another
language
all
this
is
not
to
deny
that
certain
linguistic
types
are
more
stable
and
frequently
represented
than
others
that
are
just
as
possible
from
a
theoretical
standpoint
but
we
are
too
as
yet
of
the
structural
spirit
of
great
numbers
of
languages
to
have
the
right
to
frame
a
classification
that
is
other
than
flexible
and
experimental
the
reader
will
gain
a
somewhat
livelier
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
linguistic
morphology

footnote
in
defining
the
type
to
which
a
language
belongs
one
must
be
careful
not
to
be
misled
by
structural
features
which
are
mere
survivals
of
an
older
stage
which
have
no
productive
life
and
do
not
enter
into
the
unconscious
patterning
of
the
language
all
languages
are
littered
with
such
petrified
bodies
the
english
of
and
is
an
old
agentive
suffix
but
as
far
as
the
feeling
of
the
present
generation
is
concerned
it
can
not
be
said
to
really
exist
at
all
and
have
been
completely
disconnected
from
the
etymological
group
of
and
of
web
similarly
there
are
hosts
of
related
words
in
chinese
which
differ
in
the
initial
consonant
the
vowel
the
tone
or
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
final
consonant
even
where
the
chinaman
feels
the
etymological
relationship
as
in
certain
cases
he
can
hardly
help
doing
he
can
assign
no
particular
function
to
the
phonetic
variation
as
such
hence
it
forms
no
live
feature
of
the
and
must
be
ignored
in
defining
the
general
form
of
the
language
the
caution
is
all
the
more
necessary
as
it
is
precisely
the
foreigner
who
approaches
a
new
language
with
a
certain
prying
inquisitiveness
that
is
most
apt
to
see
life
in
vestigial
features

the

is

very
nearly
complex
i
need
hardly
point
out
that
these
examples
are
far
from
exhausting
the
possibilities
of
linguistic
structure
nor
that
the
fact
that
two
languages
are
similarly
classified
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
present
a
great
similarity
on
the
surface
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
most
fundamental
and
generalized
features
of
the
spirit
the
technique
and
the
degree
of
elaboration
of
a
given
language
nevertheless
in
numerous
instances
we
may
observe
this
highly
suggestive
and
remarkable
fact
that
languages
that
fall
into
the
same
class
have
a
way
of
paralleling
each
other
in
many
details
or
in
structural
features
not
envisaged
by
the
scheme
of
classification
thus
a
most
interesting
parallel
could
be
drawn
on
structural
lines
between
takelma
and
greek
languages
that
are
as
geographically
remote
from
each
other
and
as
unconnected
in
a
historical
sense
as
two
languages
selected
at
random
can
well
be
their
similarity
goes
beyond
the
generalized
facts
registered
in
the
table
it
would
almost
seem
that
linguistic
features
that
are
easily
thinkable
apart
from
each
other
that
seem
to
have
no
necessary
connection
in
theory
have
nevertheless
a
tendency
to
cluster
or
to
follow
together
in
the
wake
of
some
deep
controlling
impulse
to
form
that
dominates
their
drift
if
therefore
we
can
only
be
sure
of
the
intuitive
similarity
of
two
given
languages
of
their
possession
of
the
same
submerged
we
need
not
be
too
much
surprised
to
find
that
they
seek
and
avoid
certain
linguistic
developments
in
common
we
are
at
present
very
far
from
able
to
define
just
what
these
fundamental
form
intuitions
are
we
can
only
feel
them
rather
vaguely
at
best
and
must
content
ourselves
for
the
most
part
with
noting
their
symptoms
these
symptoms
are
being
garnered
in
our
descriptive
and
historical
grammars
of
diverse
languages
some
day
it
may
be
we
shall
be
able
to
read
from
them
the
great
underlying
footnote
not
greek
specifically
of
course
but
as
a
typical
representative
of
such
a
purely
technical
classification
of
languages
as
the
current
one
into
isolating
agglutinative
and
inflective
read
fusional
can
not
claim
to
have
great
value
as
an
entering
wedge
into
the
discovery
of
the
intuitional
forms
of
language
i
do
not
know
whether
the
suggested
classification
into
four
conceptual
groups
is
likely
to
drive
deeper
or
not
my
own
feeling
is
that
it
does
but
classifications
neat
constructions
of
the
speculative
mind
are
slippery
things
they
have
to
be
tested
at
every
possible
opportunity
before
they
have
the
right
to
cry
for
acceptance
meanwhile
we
may
take
some
encouragement
from
the
application
of
a
rather
curious
yet
simple
historical
test
languages
are
in
constant
process
of
change
but
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
tend
to
preserve
longest
what
is
most
fundamental
in
their
structure
now
if
we
take
great
groups
of
genetically
related
languages
we
find
that
as
we
pass
from
one
to
another
or
trace
the
course
of
their
development
we
frequently
encounter
a
gradual
change
of
morphological
type
this
is
not
surprising
for
there
is
no
reason
why
a
language
should
remain
permanently
true
to
its
original
form
it
is
interesting
however
to
note
that
of
the
three
intercrossing
classifications
represented
in
our
table
conceptual
type
technique
and
degree
of
synthesis
it
is
the
degree
of
synthesis
that
seems
to
change
most
readily
that
the
technique
is
modifiable
but
far
less
readily

the

both

either

agglutinative

are

a

out

vii
language
as
a
historical
product
drift
every
one
knows
that
language
is
variable
two
individuals
of
the
same
generation
and
locality
speaking
precisely
the
same
dialect
and
moving
in
the
same
social
circles
are
never
absolutely
at
one
in
their
speech
habits
a
minute
investigation
of
the
speech
of
each
individual
would
reveal
countless
differences
of
detail
in
choice
of
words
in
sentence
structure
in
the
relative
frequency
with
which
particular
forms
or
combinations
of
words
are
used
in
the
pronunciation
of
particular
vowels
and
consonants
and
of
combinations
of
vowels
and
consonants
in
all
those
features
such
as
speed
stress
and
tone
that
give
life
to
spoken
language
in
a
sense
they
speak
slightly
divergent
dialects
of
the
same
language
rather
than
identically
the
same
language
there
is
an
important
difference
however
between
individual
and
dialectic
variations
if
we
take
two
closely
related
dialects
say
english
as
spoken
by
the
middle
classes
of
london
and
english
as
spoken
by
the
average
new
yorker
we
observe
that
however
much
the
individual
speakers
in
each
city
differ
from
each
other
the
body
of
londoners
forms
a
compact
relatively
unified
group
in
contrast
to
the
body
of
new
yorkers
the
individual
variations
are
swamped
in
or
absorbed
by
certain
major
agreements
say
of
pronunciation
and
vocabulary
which
stand
out
very
strongly
when
the
language
of
the
group
as
a
whole
is
contrasted
with
that
of
the
other
group
this
means
that
there
is
something
like
an
ideal
linguistic
entity
dominating
the
speech
habits
of
the
members
of
each
group
that
the
sense
of
almost
unlimited
freedom
which
each
individual
feels
in
the
use
of
his
language
is
held
in
leash
by
a
tacitly
directing
norm
one
individual
plays
on
the
norm
in
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
the
next
individual
is
nearer
the
dead
average
in
that
particular
respect
in
which
the
first
speaker
most
characteristically
departs
from
it
but
in
turn
diverges
from
the
average
in
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
and
so
on
what
keeps
the
variations
from
rising
to
dialectic
importance
is
not
merely
the
fact
that
they
are
in
any
event
of
small
moment
there
are
dialectic
variations
that
are
of
no
greater
magnitude
than
individual
variations
within
a
dialect
it
is
chiefly
that
they
are
silently
corrected
or
canceled
by
the
consensus
of
usage
if
all
the
speakers
of
a
given
dialect
were
arranged
in
order
in
accordance
with
the
degree
of
their
conformity
to
average
usage
there
is
little
doubt
that
they
would
constitute
a
very
finely
intergrading
series
clustered
about
a
center
or
norm
the
differences
between
any
two
neighboring
speakers
of
the
series
would
be
negligible
for
any
but
the
most
microscopic
linguistic
research
the
differences
between
the
members
of
the
series
are
sure
to
be
considerable
in
all
likelihood
considerable
enough
to
measure
up
to
a
true
dialectic
variation
what
prevents
us
from
saying
that
these
untypical
individuals
speak
distinct
dialects
is
that
their
peculiarities
as
a
unified
whole
are
not
referable
to
another
norm
than
the
norm
of
their
own
series
footnote
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
fall
out
of
the
normal
speech
group
by
reason
of
a
marked
speech
defect
or
because
they
are
isolated
foreigners
that
have
acquired
the
language
late
in
life
if
the
speech
of
any
member
of
the
series
could
actually
be
made
to
fit
into
another
dialect
series
we
should
have
no
true
barriers
between
dialects
and
languages
at
all
we
should
merely
have
a
continuous
series
of
individual
variations
extending
over
the
whole
range
of
a
historically
unified
linguistic
area
and
the
cutting
up
of
this
large
area
in
some
cases
embracing
parts
of
several
continents
into
distinct
dialects
and
languages
would
be
an
essentially
arbitrary
proceeding
with
no
warrant
save
that
of
practical
convenience
but
such
a
conception
of
the
nature
of
dialectic
variation
does
not
correspond
to
the
facts
as
we
know
them
isolated
individuals
may
be
found
who
speak
a
compromise
between
two
dialects
of
a
language
and
if
their
number
and
importance
increases
they
may
even
end
by
creating
a
new
dialectic
norm
of
their
own
a
dialect
in
which
the
extreme
peculiarities
of
the
parent
dialects
are
ironed
out
in
course
of
time
the
compromise
dialect
may
absorb
the
parents
though
more
frequently
these
will
tend
to
linger
indefinitely
as
marginal
forms
of
the
enlarged
dialect
area
but
such
phenomena
and
they
are
common
enough
in
the
history
of
language
are
evidently
quite
secondary
they
are
closely
linked
with
such
social
developments
as
the
rise
of
nationality
the
formation
of
literatures
that
aim
to
have
more
than
a
local
appeal
the
movement
of
rural
populations
into
the
cities
and
all
those
other
tendencies
that
break
up
the
intense
localism
that
unsophisticated
man
has
always
found
natural
footnote
observe
that
we
are
speaking
of
an
individual
speech
as
a
whole
it
is
not
a
question
of
isolating
some
particular
peculiarity
of
pronunciation
or
usage
and
noting
its
resemblance
to
or
identity
with
a
feature
in
another
dialect
the
explanation
of
primary
dialectic
differences
is
still
to
seek
it
is
evidently
not
enough
to
say
that
if
a
dialect
or
language
is
spoken
in
two
distinct
localities
or
by
two
distinct
social
strata
it
naturally
takes
on
distinctive
forms
which
in
time
come
to
be
divergent
enough
to
deserve
the
name
of
dialects
this
is
certainly
true
as
far
as
it
goes
dialects
do
belong
in
the
first
instance
to
very
definitely
circumscribed
social
groups
homogeneous
enough
to
secure
the
common
feeling
and
purpose
needed
to
create
a
norm
but
the
embarrassing
question
immediately
arises
if
all
the
individual
variations
within
a
dialect
are
being
constantly
leveled
out
to
the
dialectic
norm
if
there
is
no
appreciable
tendency
for
the
individual
peculiarities
to
initiate
a
dialectic
schism
why
should
we
have
dialectic
variations
at
all
ought
not
the
norm
wherever
and
whenever
threatened
automatically
to
reassert
itself
ought
not
the
individual
variations
of
each
locality
even
in
the
absence
of
intercourse
between
them
to
cancel
out
to
the
same
accepted
speech
average
if
individual
variations
on
a
flat
were
the
only
kind
of
variability
in
language
i
believe
we
should
be
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
and
how
dialects
arise
why
it
is
that
a
linguistic
prototype
gradually
breaks
up
into
a
number
of
mutually
unintelligible
languages
but
language
is
not
merely
something
that
is
spread
out
in
space
as
it
were
a
series
of
reflections
in
individual
minds
of
one
and
the
same
timeless
picture
language
moves
down
time
in
a
current
of
its
own
making
it
has
a
drift
if
there
were
no
breaking
up
of
a
language
into
dialects
if
each
language
continued
as
a
firm
unity
it
would
still
be
constantly
moving
away
from
any
assignable
norm
developing
new
features
unceasingly
and
gradually
transforming
itself
into
a
language
so
different
from
its
starting
point
as
to
be
in
effect
a
new
language
now
dialects
arise
not
because
of
the
mere
fact
of
individual
variation
but
because
two
or
more
groups
of
individuals
have
become
sufficiently
disconnected
to
drift
apart
or
independently
instead
of
together
so
long
as
they
keep
strictly
together
no
amount
of
individual
variation
would
lead
to
the
formation
of
dialects
in
practice
of
course
no
language
can
be
spread
over
a
vast
territory
or
even
over
a
considerable
area
without
showing
dialectic
variations
for
it
is
impossible
to
keep
a
large
population
from
segregating
itself
into
local
groups
the
language
of
each
of
which
tends
to
drift
independently
under
cultural
conditions
such
as
apparently
prevail
conditions
that
fight
localism
at
every
turn
the
tendency
to
dialectic
cleavage
is
being
constantly
counteracted
and
in
part
corrected
by
the
uniformizing
factors
already
referred
to
yet
even
in
so
young
a
country
as
america
the
dialectic
differences
are
not
inconsiderable
under
primitive
conditions
the
political
groups
are
small
the
tendency
to
localism
exceedingly
strong
it
is
natural
therefore
that
the
languages
of
primitive
folk
or
of
populations
in
general
are
differentiated
into
a
great
number
of
dialects
there
are
parts
of
the
globe
where
almost
every
village
has
its
own
dialect
the
life
of
the
geographically
limited
community
is
narrow
and
intense
its
speech
is
correspondingly
peculiar
to
itself
it
is
exceedingly
doubtful
if
a
language
will
ever
be
spoken
over
a
wide
area
without
multiplying
itself
dialectically
no
sooner
are
the
old
dialects
ironed
out
by
compromises
or
ousted
by
the
spread
and
influence
of
the
one
dialect
which
is
culturally
predominant
when
a
new
crop
of
dialects
arises
to
undo
the
leveling
work
of
the
past
this
is
precisely
what
happened
in
greece
for
instance
in
classical
antiquity
there
were
spoken
a
large
number
of
local
dialects
several
of
which
are
represented
in
the
literature
as
the
cultural
supremacy
of
athens
grew
its
dialect
the
attic
spread
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
until
in
the
hellenistic
period
following
the
macedonian
conquest
the
attic
dialect
in
the
vulgarized
form
known
as
the
koine
became
the
standard
speech
of
all
greece
but
this
linguistic
uniformity
did
not
long
continue
during
the
two
millennia
that
separate
the
greek
of
from
its
classical
prototype
the
koine
gradually
split
up
into
a
number
of
dialects
now
greece
is
as
richly
diversified
in
speech
as
in
the
time
of
homer
though
the
present
local
dialects
aside
from
those
of
attica
itself
are
not
the
lineal
descendants
of
the
old
dialects
of
days
the
experience
of
greece
is
not
exceptional
old
dialects
are
being
continually
wiped
out
only
to
make
room
for
new
ones
languages
can
change
at
so
many
points
of
phonetics
morphology
and
vocabulary
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
once
the
linguistic
community
is
broken
it
should
slip
off
in
different
directions
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect
a
locally
diversified
language
to
develop
along
strictly
parallel
lines
if
once
the
speech
of
a
locality
has
begun
to
drift
on
its
own
account
it
is
practically
certain
to
move
further
and
further
away
from
its
linguistic
fellows
failing
the
retarding
effect
of
dialectic
interinfluences
which
i
have
already
touched
upon
a
group
of
dialects
is
bound
to
diverge
on
the
whole
each
from
all
of
the
others
footnote
it
is
doubtful
if
we
have
the
right
to
speak
of
linguistic
uniformity
even
during
the
predominance
of
the
koine
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
when
the
various
groups
of
greeks
took
on
the
koine
they
did
not
at
once
tinge
it
with
dialectic
peculiarities
induced
by
their
previous
speech
habits
footnote
the
zaconic
dialect
of
lacedaemon
is
the
sole
exception
it
is
not
derived
from
the
koine
but
stems
directly
from
the
doric
dialect
of
sparta
in
course
of
time
each
dialect
itself
splits
up
into
which
gradually
take
on
the
dignity
of
dialects
proper
while
the
primary
dialects
develop
into
mutually
unintelligible
languages
and
so
the
budding
process
continues
until
the
divergences
become
so
great
that
none
but
a
linguistic
student
armed
with
his
documentary
evidence
and
with
his
comparative
or
reconstructive
method
would
infer
that
the
languages
in
question
were
genealogically
related
represented
independent
lines
of
development
in
other
words
from
a
remote
and
common
starting
point
yet
it
is
as
certain
as
any
historical
fact
can
be
that
languages
so
little
resembling
each
other
as
modern
irish
english
italian
greek
russian
armenian
persian
and
bengali
are
but
in
the
present
of
drifts
that
converge
to
a
in
the
dim
past
there
is
naturally
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
earliest
or
aryan
prototype
which
we
can
in
part
reconstruct
in
part
but
dimly
guess
at
is
itself
other
than
a
single
dialect
of
a
group
that
has
either
become
largely
extinct
or
is
now
further
represented
by
languages
too
divergent
for
us
with
our
limited
means
to
recognize
as
clear
kin
footnote
though
indications
are
not
lacking
of
what
these
remoter
kin
of
the
languages
may
be
this
is
disputed
ground
however
and
hardly
fit
subject
for
a
purely
general
study
of
speech
all
languages
that
are
known
to
be
genetically
related
to
be
divergent
forms
of
a
single
prototype
may
be
considered
as
constituting
a
linguistic
stock
there
is
nothing
final
about
a
linguistic
stock
when
we
set
it
up
we
merely
say
in

far
we
can
go

no
farther
at
any
point
in
the
progress

must
return
to
the
conception

drift
in

the

changes
that
take

if
the
vast
accumulation
of
minute
modifications
which
in

results
in
the
complete
remodeling
of
the

are
not
in
essence
identical
with
the
individual
variations
that
we
note
on
every
hand
about
us
if
these
variations
are
born
only
to
die
without
a
trace
while
the
equally
minute

even

changes
that
make
up

are
forever
imprinted
on
the

not

mystical

are
we
not
giving

a
power
to
change
of
its

over
and
above
the
involuntary
tendency
of
individuals
to
vary

if
this

of

is

individual

in

what
significant

in

must

to
begin
with
as
individual

this
is
perfectly
true
and
yet
it
by
no
means
follows
that
the
general
drift
of
language
can
be
understood
from
an
exhaustive
descriptive
study
of
these
variations
alone
they
themselves
are
random
phenomena
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
moving
backward
and
forward
in
purposeless

the
linguistic
drift
has
direction
in
other

only
those
individual

embody
it
or
carry
it
which
move
in
a
certain
direction
just
as
only
certain

in

the

the
drift
of

is
constituted
by
the
unconscious
selection
on
the
part
of
its
speakers
of
those
individual
variations
that
are
cumulative
in
some
special
direction
this
direction
may
be
inferred
in
the
main
from
the
past
history
of
the
language
in
the
long
run
any
new
feature
of
the
drift
becomes
part
and
parcel
of
the
common
accepted
speech
but
for
a
long
time
it
may
exist
as
a
mere
tendency
in
the
speech
of
a
few
perhaps
of
a
despised
few
as
we
look
about
us
and
observe
current
usage
it
is
not
likely
to
occur
to
us
that
our
language
has
a
slope
that
the
changes
of
the
next
few
centuries
are
in
a
sense
prefigured
in
certain
obscure
tendencies
of
the
present
and
that
these
changes
when
consummated
will
be
seen
to
be
but
continuations
of
changes
that
have
been
already
effected
we
feel
rather
that
our
language
is
practically
a
fixed
system
and
that
what
slight
changes
are
destined
to
take
place
in
it
are
as
likely
to
move
in
one
direction
as
another
the
feeling
is
fallacious
our
very
uncertainty
as
to
the
impending
details
of
change
makes
the
eventual
consistency
of
their
direction
all
the
more
impressive
footnote
or
rather
apprehended
for
we
do
not
in
sober
fact
entirely
understand
it
as
yet
footnote
not
ultimately
random
of
course
only
relatively
so
sometimes
we
can
feel
where
the
drift
is
taking
us
even
while
we
struggle
against
it
probably
the
majority
of
those
who
read
these
words
feel
that
it
is
quite
incorrect
to
say
who
did
you
see
we
readers
of
many
books
are
still
very
careful
to
say

we
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
uncomfortably
proud
it
may
be
in
the
process
we
are
likely
to
avoid
the
locution
altogether
and
to
say
who

the
natural

uncontrolled
speech
of
the
folk
to
which
we
must
look
for
advance
information
as
to
the
general
linguistic
movement
it
is
safe
to
prophesy
that
within
a
couple
of
hundred
years
from
not
even
the
most
learned
jurist
will
be
saying
whom
did
you
see
by
that
time
the
whom
will
be
as
delightfully
archaic

logical

avail
to

this
hapless

unheeded

in
relative
clauses

we
tend
to
avoid
the
objective
form
of
who
instead

itself

the

being
slowly

powerfully
supplemented
by
a
new

to
sanction
a
grammatical
blunder
even
now

may
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the

secretly
wishing

weight
off
their
unconscious
minds

some
divine
authority

pedagogue
gave
them

we
can
not
too
frankly
anticipate
the
drift

maintain

twilight
cases
in
which
we
can
cover
up
our

by
a

of
unconscious
special

that
some
one
drops
the
remark
when
you

is

to
be
a
little
hesitation
in
the
choice
of
the
form

the

usages

probably
not

induce

grammarian
may
remark
for

not
strictly
analogous
to

it

rather
an
abbreviated

the

the

point
is
that
there

psychoanalysts

fundamental
instincts
it
is
worth
looking
into
the
reason
for
our
curious
reluctance
to
use
locutions
involving
the
word
whom
particularly
in
its
interrogative
sense
the
only
distinctively
objective
forms
which
we
still
possess
in
english
are
a
little
blurred
because
of
its
identity
with
the
possessive
and
in
all
other
cases
the
objective
has
come
to
be
identical
with
the
subjective
that
is
in
outer
form
for
we
are
not
now
taking
account
of
position
in
the
sentence
we
observe
immediately
in
looking
through
the
list
of
objective
forms
that
is
psychologically
isolated
and
form
a
solid
group
of
objective
personal
pronouns
parallel
to
the
subjective
series
the
forms
and
are
technically
pronouns
but
they
are
not
felt
to
be
in
the
same
box
as
the
personal
pronouns
has
clearly
a
weak
position
an
exposed
flank
for
words
of
a
feather
tend
to
flock
together
and
if
one
strays
behind
it
is
likely
to
incur
danger
of
life
now
the
other
interrogative
and
relative
pronouns
with
which
should
properly
flock
do
not
distinguish
the
subjective
and
objective
forms
it
is
psychologically
unsound
to
draw
the
line
of
form
cleavage
between
and
the
personal
pronouns
on
the
one
side
the
remaining
interrogative
and
relative
pronouns
on
the
other
the
form
groups
should
be
symmetrically
related
to
if
not
identical
with
the
function
groups
had
and
objective
forms
parallel
to
the
position
of
this
last
would
be
more
secure
as
it
is
there
is
something
unesthetic
about
the
word
it
suggests
a
form
pattern
which
is
not
filled
out
by
its
fellows
the
only
way
to
remedy
the
irregularity
of
form
distribution
is
to
abandon
the
altogether
for
we
have
lost
the
power
to
create
new
objective
forms
and
can
not
remodel
our
group
so
as
to
make
it
parallel
with
the
smaller
group
once
this
is
done
joins
its
flock
and
our
unconscious
desire
for
form
symmetry
is
satisfied
we
do
not
secretly
chafe
at
whom
did
you
see
without
reason
footnote
note
that
it
is
different
with
this
has
not
the
support
of
analogous
possessive
forms
in
its
own
functional
group
but
the
analogical
power
of
the
great
body
of
possessives
of
nouns
as
well
as
of
certain
personal
pronouns
as
predicated
possessive
also
is
sufficient
to
give
it
vitality
but
the
drift
away
from
has
still
other
determinants
the
words
and
in
their
interrogative
sense
are
psychologically
related
not
merely
to
the
pronouns
and
but
to
a
group
of
interrogative
adverbs
all
of
which
are
invariable
and
generally
emphatic
i
believe
it
is
safe
to
infer
that
there
is
a
rather
strong
feeling
in
english
that
the
interrogative
pronoun
or
adverb
typically
an
emphatic
element
in
the
sentence
should
be
invariable
the
inflective
of
is
felt
as
a
drag
upon
the
rhetorical
effectiveness
of
the
word
it
needs
to
be
eliminated
if
the
interrogative
pronoun
is
to
receive
all
its
latent
power
there
is
still
a
third
and
a
very
powerful
reason
for
the
avoidance
of
the
contrast
between
the
subjective
and
objective
series
of
personal
pronouns
is
in
english
associated
with
a
difference
of
position
we
say
see
the
but
man
sees
told
never
he
or
told
such
usages
as
the
last
two
are
distinctly
poetic
and
archaic
they
are
opposed
to
the
present
drift
of
the
language
even
in
the
interrogative
one
does
not
say
did
you
see
it
is
only
in
sentences
of
the
type
did
you
see
that
an
inflected
objective
before
the
verb
is
now
used
at
all
on
the
other
hand
the
order
in
did
you
see
is
imperative
because
of
its
interrogative
form
the
interrogative
pronoun
or
adverb
normally
comes
first
in
the
sentence
are
you
doing
did
he
go
are
you
from
in
the
whom
of
did
you
see
there
is
concealed
therefore
a
conflict
between
the
order
proper
to
a
sentence
containing
an
inflected
objective
and
the
order
natural
to
a
sentence
with
an
interrogative
pronoun
or
adverb
the
solution
you
see
whom
or
saw
whom
is
too
contrary
to
the
idiomatic
drift
of
our
language
to
receive
acceptance
the
more
radical
solution
did
you
see
is
the
one
the
language
is
gradually
making
for
footnote
aside
from
certain
idiomatic
usages
as
when
saw
whom
is
equivalent
to
saw
so
and
so
and
that
so
and
so
is
who
in
such
sentences
is
pronounced
high
and
lingeringly
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
person
just
referred
to
by
the
listener
is
not
known
or
recognized
these
three
conflicts
on
the
score
of
form
grouping
of
rhetorical
emphasis
and
of
order
are
supplemented
by
a
fourth
difficulty
the
emphatic
with
its
heavy
build
vowel
followed
by
labial
consonant
should
contrast
with
a
lightly
tripping
syllable
immediately
following
in
however
we
have
an
involuntary
retardation
that
makes
the
locution
sound
clumsy
this
clumsiness
is
a
phonetic
verdict
quite
apart
from
the
dissatisfaction
due
to
the
grammatical
factors
which
we
have
analyzed
the
same
prosodic
objection
does
not
apply
to
such
parallel
locutions
as
and
the
vowels
of
and
are
shorter
and
their
final
consonants
melt
easily
into
the
following
which
is
pronounced
in
the
same
tongue
position
as
and
our
instinct
for
appropriate
rhythms
makes
it
as
difficult
for
us
to
feel
content
with
as
for
a
poet
to
use
words
like
and
in
a
rapid
line
neither
common
feeling
nor
the
poet
choice
need
be
at
all
conscious
it
may
be
that
not
all
are
equally
sensitive
to
the
rhythmic
flow
of
speech
but
it
is
probable
that
rhythm
is
an
unconscious
linguistic
determinant
even
with
those
who
set
little
store
by
its
artistic
use
in
any
event
the
poet
rhythms
can
only
be
a
more
sensitive
and
stylicized
application
of
rhythmic
tendencies
that
are
characteristic
of
the
daily
speech
of
his
people
we
have
discovered
no
less
than
four
factors
which
enter
into
our
subtle
disinclination
to
say
whom
did
you
see
the
uneducated
folk
that
says
who
did
you
see
with
no
twinge
of
conscience
has
a
more
acute
flair
for
the
genuine
drift
of
the
language
than
its
students
naturally
the
four
restraining
factors
do
not
operate
independently
their
separate
energies
if
we
may
make
bold
to
use
a
mechanical
concept
are
canalized
into
a
single
force
this
force
or
minute
embodiment
of
the
general
drift
of
the
language
is
psychologically
registered
as
a
slight
hesitation
in
using
the
word
the
hesitation
is
likely
to
be
quite
unconscious
though
it
may
be
readily
acknowledged
when
attention
is
called
to
it
the
analysis
is
certain
to
be
unconscious
or
rather
unknown
to
the
normal
speaker
how
then
can
we
be
certain
in
such
an
analysis
as
we
have
undertaken
that
all
of
the
assigned
determinants
are
really
operative
and
not
merely
some
one
of
them
certainly

that
they

sometimes
be
tested
by
the
method
of
elimination

missing

we
observe
a
slight
diminution
in
the
corresponding

reaction

may
conclude
that
the

positive

only
to
the
interrogative

of
the
fourth
factor
applies
with
more
force
to
the
interrogative
than
to
the
relative

can
therefore
understand
why

sentence

he
the
man

you
referred
to

not
as
idiomatic
as
he
the
man
that
you
referred

it

against

three
is
still
not
as
difficult
to
reconcile
with
our
innate
feeling
for
english
expression
as
did
you
see
if
we
eliminate
the
fourth
factor
from
the
interrogative
usage

in
are
you
looking
at
where
the
vowel
following
relieves
this

we
can
observe
if
i
am
not
mistaken
a
lesser
reluctance

for
we
can
never

we
have
isolated
all
the
determinants
of
a
drift
in
our
particular
case
we
have
ignored
what
may
well
prove
to
be
a
controlling
factor
in
the
history
of
and
in
the
relative
sense
this
is
the
unconscious
desire
to
leave
these
words
to
their
interrogative
function
and
to
concentrate
on
or
mere
word
order
as
expressions
of
the
relative
man
that
i
referred

referred
this
drift

does
not
directly
concern
the

of
as
a
form
of
may
have
made
the
relative
obsolete
before
the
other
factors
affecting
relative
have
run
their
course
a
consideration
like
this
is
instructive
because
it
indicates
that
knowledge
of
the
general
drift
of
a
language
is
insufficient
to
enable
us
to
see
clearly
what
the
drift
is
heading
for
we
need
to
know
something
of
the
relative
potencies
and
speeds
of
the
components
of
the
drift
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
particular
drifts
involved
in
the
use
of
are
of
interest
to
us
not
for
their
own
sake
but
as
symptoms
of
larger
tendencies
at
work
in
the
language
at
least
three
drifts
of
major
importance
are
discernible
each
of
these
has
operated
for
centuries
each
is
at
work
in
other
parts
of
our
linguistic
mechanism
each
is
almost
certain
to
continue
for
centuries
possibly
millennia
the
first
is
the
familiar
tendency
to
level
the
distinction
between
the
subjective
and
the
objective
itself
but
a
late
chapter
in
the
steady
reduction
of
the
old
system
of
syntactic
cases
this
system
which
is
at
present
best
preserved
in
lithuanian
was
already
considerably
reduced
in
the
old
germanic
language
of
which
english
dutch
german
danish
and
swedish
are
modern
dialectic
forms
the
seven
cases
nominative
genitive
dative
accusative
ablative
locative
instrumental
had
been
already
reduced
to
four
nominative
genitive
dative
accusative
we
know
this
from
a
careful
comparison
of
and
reconstruction
based
on
the
oldest
germanic
dialects
of
which
we
still
have
records
gothic
old
icelandic
old
high
german
in
the
group
of
west
germanic
dialects
for
the
study
of
which
old
high
german
old
frisian
and
old
saxon
are
our
oldest
and
most
valuable
sources
we
still
have
these
four
cases
but
the
phonetic
form
of
the
case
syllables
is
already
greatly
reduced
and
in
certain
paradigms
particular
cases
have
coalesced
the
case
system
is
practically
intact
but
it
is
evidently
moving
towards
further
disintegration
within
the
and
early
middle
english
period
there
took
place
further
changes
in
the
same
direction
the
phonetic
form
of
the
case
syllables
became
still
further
reduced
and
the
distinction
between
the
accusative
and
the
dative
finally
disappeared
the
new
objective
is
really
an
amalgam
of
old
accusative
and
dative
forms
thus
the
old
dative
we
still
say
give
him
the
not
abbreviated
from
give
to
compare
gothic
modern
german
took
over
the
functions
of
the
old
accusative
compare
gothic
modern
german
and
dative
the
distinction
between
the
nominative
and
accusative
was
nibbled
away
by
phonetic
processes
and
morphological
levelings
until
only
certain
pronouns
retained
distinctive
subjective
and
objective
forms

been

ourselves
pretty
much
to
analytic
locutions

toward
the
limitation
of

not
follow
that
the

such
is
still

one
of
the
most
insidious
peculiarities
of
a
linguistic
drift
is
that
where
it
can
not
destroy

way
it
renders
it
innocuous
by
washing
the

out

turns
its
very
enemies
to
its
own
uses
this
brings
us
to
the
second
of
the
major
drifts
the
tendency
to
fixed

go
into
the
history
of
this
drift
it
is
enough
to
know
that
as
the
inflected

were
more
and

inadequately

aside

there
is
a
strong
tendency

the

bear
a
stronger
stress
than
the

this
is
why
the
stress
in
locutions

thrown

we
have
a
curious
bit
of
further
evidence
to
prove
that
the

personal

have
lost
some
share
of
their
original
syntactic
force

subjective

to
speak

become

any
other

we
should
not
have
been
able
to
coin
such
compounds

are
psychologically
analogous

a

as

the
equivalents

all

may
conclude
that
our
english
case
system
is
weaker
than
it
looks
and
that
in
one
way
or
another
it
is
destined
to
get
itself
reduced
to
an
absolutive
caseless
form
for
all
nouns
and
pronouns
but
those
that
are
animate
animate
nouns
and
pronouns
are
sure
to
have
distinctive
possessive
forms
for
an
indefinitely
long
period
meanwhile
observe
that
the
old
alignment
of
case
forms
is
being
invaded
by
two
new
categories
a
positional
category
and
a
classificatory
category

the
facts

in
the
possessive
animate
nouns

are
destined
to
be
more
and
more
sharply
distinguished
from
inanimate
nouns
and
pronouns
but
the
but
and
that
on
the
whole
it
is
only
animate
pronouns
that
distinguish
and
forms
are
of
the
greatest
theoretical
interest
they
show
that
however
the
language
strive
for
a
more
and
more
analytic
form
it
is
by
no
means
manifesting
a
drift
toward
the
expression
of
pure
relational
concepts
in
the
manner
the
insistence
on
the
concreteness
of
the
relational
concepts
is
clearly
stronger
than
the
destructive
power
of
the
most
sweeping
and
persistent
drifts
that
we
know
of

the
history

the
drift
toward
the
abolition
of

distinctions

the
correlative
drift
toward
position
as
an
grammatical
method
are
accompanied
in
a
sense
dominated
by
the
last
of
the
three
major
drifts
that
i
have
referred
to
this
is
the
drift
toward
the
invariable
word
in
analyzing
the
whom
sentence
i
pointed
out
that
the
rhetorical
emphasis
natural
to
an
interrogative
pronoun
lost
something
by
its
form
variability
this
striving
for
a
simple
unnuanced
correspondence
between
idea
and
word
as
invariable
as
may
be
is
very
strong
in
english
it
accounts
for
a
number
of
tendencies
which
at
first
sight
seem
unconnected
certain
forms
like
the
present
third
person
singular
of
or
the
plural
of
have
resisted
the
drift
to
invariable
words
possibly
because
they
symbolize
certain
stronger
form
cravings
that
we
do
not
yet
fully
understand
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
derivations
that
get
away
sufficiently
from
the
concrete
notion
of
the
radical
word
to
exist
as
independent
conceptual
centers
are
not
affected
by
this
elusive
drift
as
soon
as
the
derivation
runs
danger
of
being
felt
as
a
mere
nuancing
of
a
finicky
play
on
the
primary
concept
it
tends
to
be
absorbed
by
the
radical
word
to
disappear
as
such
english
words
crave
spaces
between
them
they
do
not
like
to
huddle
in
clusters
of
slightly
divergent
centers
of
meaning
each
edging
a
little
away
from
the
rest
a
noun
of
quality
almost
a
noun
of
relation
that
takes
its
cue
from
the
concrete
idea
of
good
without
necessarily
predicating
that
quality
do
not
think
much
of
his
is
sufficiently
spaced
from
itself
not
to
need
fear
absorption
similarly
can
hold
its
own
against
because
it
destroys
the
latter
sphere
of
influence
is
psychologically
as
distinct
from
as
is
or
it
is
different
with
adverbs
in
these
lean
too
heavily
on
their
adjectives
to
have
the
kind
of
vitality
that
english
demands
of
its
words
it
quickly
drags
psychologically
the
nuance
expressed
by
is
too
close
to
that
of
their
circles
of
concreteness
are
too
nearly
the
same
for
the
two
words
to
feel
comfortable
together
the
adverbs
in
are
likely
to
go
to
the
wall
in
the
not
too
distant
future
for
this
very
reason
and
in
face
of
their
obvious
usefulness
another
instance
of
the
sacrifice
of
highly
useful
forms
to
this
impatience
of
nuancing
is
the
group
they
could
not
persist
in
live
usage
because
they
impinged
too
solidly
upon
the
circles
of
meaning
represented
by
the
words
and
in
saying
we
feel
too
keenly
that
we
repeat
all
of
that
we
add
to
an
important
nuance
of
direction
irritates
rather

prefer
to
merge
the
static
and
the
directive

you

you
going

if
need
be
to
overdo
a
little
the
concept
of

to
now
it
is
highly
symptomatic
of
the
nature
of
the
drift
away
from
word
clusters
that
we
do
not
object
to
nuances
as
such
we
object
to
having
the
nuances
formally
earmarked
for
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
vocabulary
is
rich
in
and
in
groups
of
words
that
are
psychologically
near
relatives
but
these
and
these
groups
do
not
hang
together
by
reason
of
etymology
we
are
satisfied
with
and
just
because
they
keep
aloof
from
each
other
and
go
better
together
than
and
the
english
vocabulary
is
a
rich
medley
because
each
english
word
wants
its
own
castle
has
english
long
been
peculiarly
receptive
to
foreign
words
because
it
craves
the
staking
out
of
as
many
word
areas
as
possible
or
conversely
has
the
mechanical
imposition
of
a
flood
of
french
and
latin
unrooted
in
our
earlier
tradition
so
dulled
our
feeling
for
the
possibilities
of
our
native
resources
that
we
are
allowing
these
to
shrink
by
default
i
suspect
that
both
propositions
are
true
each
feeds
on
the
other
i
do
not
think
it
likely
however
that
the
borrowings
in
english
have
been
as
mechanical
and
external
a
process
as
they
are
generally
represented
to
have
been
there
was
something
about
the
english
drift
as
early
as
the
period
following
the
norman
conquest
that
welcomed
the
new
words
they
were
a
compensation
for
something
that
was
weakening
within
viii
language
as
a
historical
product
phonetic
law
i
have
preferred
to
take
up
in
some
detail
the
analysis
of
our
hesitation
in
using
a
locution
like
whom
did
you
see
and
to
point
to
some
of
the
english
drifts
particular
and
general
that
are
implied
by
this
hesitation
than
to
discuss
linguistic
change
in
the
abstract
what
is
true
of
the
particular
idiom
that
we
started
with
is
true
of
everything
else
in
language
nothing
is
perfectly
static
every
word
every
grammatical
element
every
locution
every
sound
and
accent
is
a
slowly
changing
configuration
molded
by
the
invisible
and
impersonal
drift
that
is
the
life
of
language
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
this
drift
has
a
certain
consistent
direction
its
speed
varies
enormously
according
to
circumstances
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
define
we
have
already
seen
that
lithuanian
is
nearer
its
prototype
than
was
the
hypothetical
germanic
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
before
christ
german
has
moved
more
slowly
than
english
in
some
respects
it
stands
roughly
midway
between
english
and
in
others
it
has
of
course
diverged
from
the
line
when
i
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
dialects
formed
because
a
language
broken
up
into
local
segments
could
not
move
along
the
same
drift
in
all
of
these
segments
i
meant
of
course
that
it
could
not
move
along
identically
the
same
drift
the
general
drift
of
a
language
has
its
depths
at
the
surface
the
current
is
relatively
fast
in
certain
features
dialects
drift
apart
rapidly
by
that
very
fact
these
features
betray
themselves
as
less
fundamental
to
the
genius
of
the
language
than
the
more
slowly
modifiable
features
in
which
the
dialects
keep
together
long
after
they
have
grown
to
be
mutually
alien
forms
of
speech
but
this
is
not
all
the
momentum
of
the
more
fundamental
the
drift
is
often
such
that
languages
long
disconnected
will
pass
through
the
same
or
strikingly
similar
phases
in
many
such
cases
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
could
have
been
no
dialectic
interinfluencing
these
parallelisms
in
drift
may
operate
in
the
phonetic
as
well
as
in
the
morphological
sphere
or
they
may
affect
both
at
the
same
time
here
is
an
interesting
example
the
english
type
of
plural
represented
by
is
strictly
parallel
to
the
german
one
would
be
inclined
to
surmise
that
these
dialectic
forms
go
back
to
old
germanic
or
alternations
of
the
same
type
but
the
documentary
evidence
shows
conclusively
that
there
could
have
been
no
plurals
of
this
type
in
primitive
germanic
there
is
no
trace
of
such
vocalic
mutation
umlaut
in
gothic
our
most
archaic
germanic
language
more
significant
still
is
the
fact
that
it
does
not
appear
in
our
oldest
old
high
german
texts
and
begins
to
develop
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
old
high
german
period
circa
in
the
middle
high
german
period
the
mutation
was
carried
through
in
all
dialects
the
typical
old
high
german
forms
are
singular
plural

the
corresponding
middle

the
regular

of
these

that
our
modern
english

correspond
to
these

already
in
use
in
the
earliest
english
monuments
that
we
possess
dating
from
the
eighth
century
and
thus
antedate
the
middle
high
german
forms
by
three
hundred
years
or
more
in
other
words
on
this
particular
point
it
took
german
at
least
three
hundred
years
to
catch
up
with
a
drift
that
had
long
been
under
way
in
english
the
mere
fact
that
the
affected
vowels
of
related
words
old
high
german
are
not
always
the
same
shows
that
the
affection
took
place
at
different
periods
in
german
and
english
there
was
evidently
some
general
tendency
or
group
of
tendencies
at
work
in
early
germanic
long
before
english
and
german
had
developed
as
such
that
eventually
drove
both
of
these
dialects
along
closely
parallel
paths

changed

probably
the
most
central

gradual

up
a

fundamental
share

the
of

their
influence
reaches
far
beyond
the
proper
sphere
of
phonetics

invades
that
of
morphology
as
we
shall
see
a
drift
that
begins
as
a
slight
phonetic
readjustment
or
unsettlement
may
in
the
course
of
millennia
bring
about
the
most
profound
structural
changes
the
mere
fact
for
instance
that
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
throw
the
stress
automatically
on
the
first
syllable
of
a
word
may
eventually
change
the
fundamental
type
of
the
language
reducing
its
final
syllables
to
zero
and
driving
it
to
the
use
of
more
and
more
analytical
or
symbolic
methods
the
english
phonetic
laws
involved
in
the
rise
of
the
words
and
from
their
early
prototypes

be
briefly
summarized

phonetic

regulated

change

older

the
present

know
that
there
is
a
strong
drift
towards
the
short
open
vowel
of

whether
or
not
all
the
old
long
words
will
eventually
be
affected
we
can
not
presume
to
say
if
they
all
or
practically
all
are
taken
by
the
drift
phonetic
law
will
be
as
regular
as
sweeping
as
most
of
the
twelve
that
have
preceded
it
if
not
it
may
eventually
be
possible
if
past
experience
is
a
safe
guide
to
show
that
the
modified
words
form
a
natural
phonetic
group
that
is
that
the
law
will
have
operated
under
certain
definable
limiting
conditions
that
all
words
ending
in
a
voiceless
consonant
such
as
were
affected

that
all
words
ending
in
the
or
in
a
voiced
consonant
remained
unaffected
whatever
the
upshot
we
may
be
reasonably
certain
that
when
the
phonetic
law
has
run
its
course
the
distribution
of
long
and
short
vowels
in
the
old
will
not
seem
quite
as
erratic
as
at
the
present
transitional
moment
we
learn
incidentally
the
fundamental
fact
that
phonetic
laws
do
not
work
with
spontaneous
automatism
that
they
are
simply
a
formula
for
a
consummated
drift

exposed
point

gradually
worms
its

a
sibilant
intermediate
between
our
and
in
modern

german
it
has
become
voiced
to
it
is
important
not
to
confound
this
with
the
voiceless
intervocalic
that
soon
arose
from
the
older
lisped
in
modern
german
aside
from
certain
dialects
old

are
not

have

can
still
be
distinguished
as

voiceless
between

and
we
can
not
even
begin
to
ferret
out
and
discuss
all
the
psychological
problems
that
are
concealed
behind
these
bland
tables
their
general
parallelism
is
obvious
indeed
we
might
say
that
the
english
and
german
forms
resemble
each
other
more
than
does
either
set
the
west
germanic
prototypes
from
which
each
is
independently
derived
each
table
illustrates
the
tendency
to
reduction
of
unaccented
syllables
the
vocalic
modification
of
the
radical
element
under
the
influence
of
the
following
vowel
the
rise
in

position
of
the

middle

to

to
to
to
the
diphthongizing
of
the
old
high
vowels
english
to
to
english
and
german
to
to
german
to
to
these
dialectic
parallels
can
not
be
accidental
they
are
rooted
in
a
common
drift
phonetic
changes
are
regular
all
but
one
english
table
x
and
that
as
yet
uncompleted
of
the
particular
phonetic
laws
represented
in
our
tables
affect
all
examples
of
the
sound
in
question
or
if
the
phonetic
change
is
conditional
all
examples
of
the
same
sound
that
are
analogously
circumstanced
an
example
of
the
first
type
of
change
is
the
passage
in
english
of
all
old
long
to
diphthongal
via
the
passage
could
hardly
have
been
sudden
or
automatic
but
it
was
rapid
enough
to
prevent
an
irregularity
of
development
due
to
cross
drifts
the
second
type
of
change
is
illustrated
in
the
development
of
long
to
long
via
under
the
influence
of
a
following
in
the
first
case
we
may
say
that
mechanically
replaced
long
in
the
second
that
the
old
long
split
into
two
sounds
long
eventually
and
long
eventually
the
former
type
of
change
did
no
violence
to
the
old
phonetic
pattern
the
formal
distribution
of
sounds
into
groups
the
latter
type
rearranged
the
pattern
somewhat
if
neither
of
the
two
sounds
into
which
an
old
one
splits
is
a
new
sound
it
means
that
there
has
been
a
phonetic
leveling
that
two
groups
of
words
each
with
a
distinct
sound
or
sound
combination
have
fallen
together
into
one
group
this
kind
of
leveling
is
quite
frequent
in
the
history
of
language
in
english
for
instance
we
have
seen
that
all
the
old
long
after
they
had
become
unrounded
were
indistinguishable
from
the
mass
of
long
this
meant
that
the
long
became
a
more
heavily
weighted
point
of
the
phonetic
pattern
than
before
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
often
languages
have
striven
to
drive
originally
distinct
sounds
into
certain
favorite
positions
regardless
of
resulting
confusions
in
modern
greek
for
instance
the
vowel
is
the
historical
resultant
of
no
less
than
ten
etymologically
distinct
vowels
long
and
short
and
diphthongs
of
the
classical
speech
of
athens
there
is
then
good
evidence
to
show
that
there
are
general
phonetic
drifts
toward
particular
sounds
footnote
in
practice
phonetic
laws
have
their
exceptions
but
more
intensive
study
almost
invariably
shows
that
these
exceptions
are
more
apparent
than
real
they
are
generally
due
to
the
disturbing
influence
of
morphological
groupings
or
to
special
psychological
reasons
which
inhibit
the
normal
progress
of
the
phonetic
drift
it
is
remarkable
with
how
few
exceptions
one
need
operate
in
linguistic
history
aside
from
analogical
leveling
morphological
replacement
footnote
these
confusions
are
more
theoretical
than
real
however
a
language
has
countless
methods
of
avoiding
practical
ambiguities
more
often
the
phonetic
drift
is
of
a
more
general
character
it
is
not
so
much
a
movement
toward
a
particular
set
of
sounds
as
toward
particular
types
of
articulation
the
vowels
tend
to
become
higher
or
lower
the
diphthongs
tend
to
coalesce
into
monophthongs
the
voiceless
consonants
tend
to
become
voiced
stops
tend
to
become
spirants
as
a
matter
of
fact
practically
all
the
phonetic
laws
enumerated
in
the
two
tables
are
but
specific
instances
of
such
phonetic
drifts
the
raising
of
english
long
to
and
of
long
to
for
instance
was
part
of
a
general
tendency
to
raise
the
position
of
the
long
vowels
just
as
the
change
of
to
in
old
high
german
was
part
of
a
general
tendency
to
make
voiceless
spirants
of
the
old
voiceless
stopped
consonants
a
single
sound
change
even
if
there
is
no
phonetic
leveling
generally
threatens
to
upset
the
old
phonetic
pattern
because
it
brings
about
a
disharmony
in
the
grouping
of
sounds
to
reëstablish
the
old
pattern
without
going
back
on
the
drift
the
only
possible
method
is
to
have
the
other
sounds
of
the
series
shift
in
analogous
fashion
if
for
some
reason
or
other
becomes
shifted
to
its
voiced
correspondent
the
old
series
appears
in
the
unsymmetrical
form
such
a
series
is
in
phonetic
effect
not
the
equivalent
of
the
old
series
however
it
may
answer
to
it
in
etymology
the
general
phonetic
pattern
is
impaired
to
that
extent
but
if
and
are
also
shifted
to
their
voiced
correspondents
and
the
old
series
is
reëstablished
in
a
new
form
the
pattern
as
such
is
preserved
or
restored
the
new
series
does
not
become
confused
with
an
old
series
of
distinct
historical
antecedents
if
there
is
no
such
older
series
the
creation
of
a
series
causes
no
difficulties
if
there
is
the
old
patterning
of
sounds
can
be
kept
intact
only
by
shifting
the
old
sounds
in
some
way
they
may
become
aspirated
to
or
spirantized
or
nasalized
or
they
may
develop
any
other
peculiarity
that
keeps
them
intact
as
a
series
and
serves
to
differentiate
them
from
other
series
and
this
sort
of
shifting
about
without
loss
of
pattern
or
with
a
minimum
loss
of
it
is
probably
the
most
important
tendency
in
the
history
of
speech
sounds
phonetic
leveling
and
splitting
counteract
it
to
some
extent
but
on
the
whole
it
remains
the
central
unconscious
regulator
of
the
course
and
speed
of
sound
changes
the
desire
to
hold
on
to
a
pattern
the
tendency
to
correct
a
disturbance
by
an
elaborate
chain
of
supplementary
changes
often
spread
over
centuries
or
even
millennia
these
psychic
undercurrents
of
language
are
exceedingly
difficult
to
understand
in
terms
of
individual
psychology
though
there
can
be
no
denial
of
their
historical
reality
what
is
the
primary
cause
of
the
unsettling
of
a
phonetic
pattern
and
what
is
the
cumulative
force
that
selects
these
or
those
particular
variations
of
the
individual
on
which
to
float
the
pattern
readjustments
we
hardly
know
many
linguistic
students
have
made
the
fatal
error
of
thinking
of
sound
change
as
a
instead
of
as
a
strictly
psychological
phenomenon
or
they
have
tried
to
dispose
of
the
problem
by
bandying
such
catchwords
as
the
tendency
to
increased
ease
of
articulation
or
the
cumulative
result
of
faulty
perception
on
the
part
of
children
say
in
learning
to
speak
these
easy
explanations
will
not
do
ease
of
articulation
may
enter
in
as
a
factor
but
it
is
a
rather
subjective
concept
at
best
indians
find
hopelessly
difficult
sounds
and
sound
combinations
that
are
simple
to
us
one
language
encourages
a
phonetic
drift
that
another
does
everything
to
fight
faulty
perception
does
not
explain
that
impressive
drift
in
speech
sounds
which
i
have
insisted
upon
it
is
much
better
to
admit
that
we
do
not
yet
understand
the
primary
cause
or
causes
of
the
slow
drift
in
phonetics
though
we
can
frequently
point
to
contributing
factors
it
is
likely
that
we
shall
not
advance
seriously
until
we
study
the
intuitional
bases
of
speech
how
can
we
understand
the
nature
of
the
drift
that
frays
and
reforms
phonetic
patterns
when
we
have
never
thought
of
studying
sound
patterning
as
such
and
the
weights
and
psychic
relations
of
the
single
elements
the
individual
sounds
in
these
patterns
every
linguist
knows
that
phonetic
change
is
frequently
followed
by
morphological
rearrangements
but
he
is
apt
to
assume
that
morphology
exercises
little
or
no
influence
on
the
course
of
phonetic
history
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
our
present
tendency
to
isolate
phonetics
and
grammar
as
mutually
irrelevant
linguistic
provinces
is
unfortunate
there
are
likely
to
be
fundamental
relations
between
them
and
their
respective
histories
that
we
do
not
yet
fully
grasp
after
all
if
speech
sounds
exist
merely
because
they
are
the
symbolic
carriers
of
significant
concepts
and
groupings
of
concepts
why
may
not
a
strong
drift
or
a
permanent
feature
in
the
conceptual
sphere
exercise
a
furthering
or
retarding
influence
on
the
phonetic
drift
i
believe
that
such
influences
may
be
demonstrated
and
that
they
deserve
far
more
careful
study
than
they
have
received
this
brings
us
back
to
our
unanswered
question
how
is
it
that
both
english
and
german
developed
the
curious
alternation
of
unmodified
vowel
in
the
singular
and
modified
vowel
in
the
plural
was
the
alternation
of
and
an
absolutely
mechanical
matter
without
other
than
incidental
morphological
interest
it
is
always
so
represented
and
indeed
all
the
external
facts
support
such
a
view
the
change
from
to
later
is
by
no
means
peculiar
to
the
plural
it
is
found
also
in
the
dative
singular
for
it
too
goes
back
to
an
older
moreover
of
the
plural
applies
only
to
the
nominative
and
accusative
the
genitive
has
the
dative
only
centuries
later
was
the
alternation
of
and
reinterpreted
as
a
means
of
distinguishing
number
was
generalized
for
the
singular
for
the
plural
only
when
this
reassortment
of
forms
took
place
was
the
modern
symbolic
value
of
the
alternation
clearly
established
again
we
must
not
forget
that
was
modified
to
e
in
all
manner
of
other
grammatical
and
derivative
formations
thus
a
later
to
hang
corresponded
to
a
later
hangs
to
doom
blood
and
food
corresponded
the
verbal
derivatives
later
to
deem
later
to
bleed
and
later
to
feed
all
this
seems
to
point
to
the
purely
mechanical
nature
of
the
modification
of
to
to
so
many
unrelated
functions
were
ultimately
served
by
the
vocalic
change
that
we
can
not
believe
that
it
was
motivated
by
any
one
of
them
footnote
a
type
of
adjustment
generally
referred
to
as
analogical
leveling
the
german
facts
are
entirely
analogous
only
later
in
the
history
of
the
language
was
the
vocalic
alternation
made
significant
for
number
and
yet
consider
the
following
facts
the
change
of
to
antedated
that
of
to
this
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
lucky
accident
for
if
had
become
before
the
had
had
the
chance
to
exert
a
retroactive
influence
on
the
there
would
have
been
no
difference
between
the
singular
and
the
plural
this
would
have
been
anomalous
in
for
a
masculine
noun
but
was
the
sequence
of
phonetic
changes
an
accident
consider
two
further
facts
all
the
germanic
languages
were
familiar
with
vocalic
change
as
possessed
of
functional
significance
alternations
like
were
ingrained
in
the
linguistic
consciousness
further
the
tendency
toward
the
weakening
of
final
syllables
was
very
strong
even
then
and
had
been
manifesting
itself
in
one
way
and
another
for
centuries
i
believe
that
these
further
facts
help
us
to
understand
the
actual
sequence
of
phonetic
changes
we
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
and
could
afford
to
stay
the
change
to
and
until
the
destructive
drift
had
advanced
to
the
point
where
failure
to
modify
the
vowel
would
soon
result
in
morphological
embarrassment
at
a
certain
moment
the
ending
of
the
plural
and
analogous
endings
with
in
other
formations
was
felt
to
be
too
weak
to
quite
bear
its
functional
burden
the
unconscious
mind
if
i
may
be
allowed
a
somewhat
summary
way
of
putting
the
complex
facts
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
certain
individual
variations
until
then
automatically
canceled
out
to
have
some
share
of
the
burden
thrown
on
them
these
particular
variations
won
through
because
they
so
beautifully
allowed
the
general
phonetic
drift
to
take
its
course
without
unsettling
the
morphological
contours
of
the
language
and
the
presence
of
symbolic
variation
acted
as
an
attracting
force
on
the
rise
of
a
new
variation
of
similar
character
all
these
factors
were
equally
true
of
the
german
vocalic
shift
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
destructive
phonetic
drift
was
proceeding
at
a
slower
rate
in
german
than
in
english
the
preservative
change
of
to
to
did
not
need
to
set
in
until
years
or
more
after
the
analogous
english
change
nor
did
it
and
this
is
to
my
mind
a
highly
significant
fact
phonetic
changes
may
sometimes
be
unconsciously
encouraged
in
order
to
keep
intact
the
psychological
spaces
between
words
and
word
forms
the
general
drift
seizes
upon
those
individual
sound
variations
that
help
to
preserve
the
morphological
balance
or
to
lead
to
the
new
balance
that
the
language
is
striving
for
i
would
suggest
then
that
phonetic
change
is
compacted
of
at
least
three
basic
strands
a
general
drift
in
one
direction
concerning
the
nature
of
which
we
know
almost
nothing
but
which
may
be
suspected
to
be
of
prevailingly
dynamic
character
tendencies
to
greater
or
less
stress
greater
or
less
voicing
of
elements
a
readjusting
tendency
which
aims
to
preserve
or
restore
the
fundamental
phonetic
pattern
of
the
language
a
preservative
tendency
which
sets
in
when
a
too
serious
morphological
unsettlement
is
threatened
by
the
main
drift
i
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
it
is
always
possible
to
separate
these
strands
or
that
this
purely
schematic
statement
does
justice
to
the
complex
forces
that
guide
the
phonetic
drift
the
phonetic
pattern
of
a
language
is
not
invariable
but
it
changes
far
less
readily
than
the
sounds
that
compose
it
every
phonetic
element
that
it
possesses
may
change
radically
and
yet
the
pattern
remain
unaffected
it
would
be
absurd
to
claim
that
our
present
english
pattern
is
identical
with
the
old
one
yet
it
is
impressive
to
note
that
even
at
this
late
day
the
english
series
of
initial
consonants
corresponds
point
for
point
to
the
sanskrit
series
the
relation
between
phonetic
pattern
and
individual
sound
is
roughly
parallel
to
that
which
obtains
between
the
morphologic
type
of
a
language
and
one
of
its
specific
morphological
features
both
phonetic
pattern
and
fundamental
type
are
exceedingly
conservative
all
superficial
appearances
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
which
is
more
so
we
can
not
say
i
suspect
that
they
hang
together
in
a
way
that
we
can
not
at
present
quite
understand
if
all
the
phonetic
changes
brought
about
by
the
phonetic
drift
were
allowed
to
stand
it
is
probable
that
most
languages
would
present
such
irregularities
of
morphological
contour
as
to
lose
touch
with
their
formal
sound
changes
work
mechanically
hence
they
are
likely
to
affect
a
whole
morphological
group
here
this
does
not
matter
only
part
of
a
morphological
group
there
and
this
may
be
disturbing
thus
the
old
paradigm
sing
plur
ac
older
older
could
not
long
stand
unmodified
the
alternation
was
welcome
in
so
far
as
it
roughly
distinguished
the
singular
from
the
plural
the
dative
singular
however
though
justified
historically
was
soon
felt
to
be
an
intrusive
feature
the
analogy
of
simpler
and
more
numerously
represented
paradigms
created
the
form
compare
fish
dative
singular
as
a
dative
becomes
obsolete
the
singular
now
had
throughout
but
this
very
fact
made
the
genitive
and
dative
of
the
plural
seem
out
of
place
the
nominative
and
accusative
was
naturally
far
more
frequently
in
use
than
were
the
corresponding
forms
of
the
genitive
and
dative
these
in
the
end
could
not
but
follow
the
analogy
of
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
middle
english
period
therefore
we
find
that
the
old
paradigm
has
yielded
to
a
more
regular
one
sing
plur
ac
the
starred
forms
are
the
old
nucleus
around
which
the
new
paradigm
is
built
the
unstarred
forms
are
not
genealogical
kin
of
their
formal
prototypes
they
are
analogical
replacements
the
history
of
the
english
language
teems
with
such
levelings
or
extensions
and
were
at
one
time
the
only
possible
comparative
and
superlative
forms
of
compare

the
general
analogy

has
caused
the
replacement
of

by
the
forms
with
unmodified
vowel

and
survive
only
as
somewhat
archaic
terms
for
the

this
illustrates
the
tendency
for
words
that
are
psychologically
disconnected
from

to
preserve

that

otherwise

to

of

of

or
atrophied
forms
is
not
without
value

of
the

of

for
suggestive
hints

to
its
remoter
affiliations
analogy
may
not
only
refashion
forms
within
the
confines
of
a

cluster
of
forms
a
paradigm
but
may
extend
its
influence
far
beyond
of
a
number
of
functionally
equivalent
elements
for
instance
only
one
may
survive
the
rest
yielding
to
its
constantly
widening
influence
this
is
what
happened
with
the
english
plural
originally
confined
to
a
particular
class
of
masculines
though
an
important
class
the
plural
was
gradually
generalized
for
all
nouns
but
a
mere
handful
that
still
illustrate
plural
types
now
all

thus
analogy
not
only
regularizes
irregularities
that
have
come
in
the
wake
of
phonetic
processes
but
introduces
disturbances
generally
in
favor
of
greater
simplicity
or
regularity
in
a
long
established
system
of
forms
these
analogical
adjustments
are
practically
always
symptoms
of
the
general
morphological
drift
of
the
language
a
morphological
feature
that
appears
as
the
incidental
consequence
of
a
phonetic
process
like
the
english
plural
with
modified
vowel
may
spread
by
analogy
no
less
readily
than
old
features
that
owe
their
origin
to
other
than
phonetic
causes
once
the
of
middle
english
had
become
confined
to
the
plural
there
was
no
theoretical
reason
why
alternations
of
the
type
and
might
not
have
become
established
as
a
productive
type
of

in
the
noun
as
a
matter

fact
it
did
not
so
become
established
the
type
of
plural
secured
but
a
momentary
foothold
it
was
swept
into
being
by
one
of
the
surface
drifts
of
the
language
to
be
swept
aside
in
the
middle
english
period
by
the
more
powerful
drift
toward
the
use
of
simple
distinctive
forms
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
for
our
language
to
be
seriously
interested
in
such
pretty
symbolisms
as
what
examples
of
the

arose
legitimately
in

purely
phonetic
processes
were
tolerated
for
a
time
but
the
type
as
such
never
had
a
serious
future
it
was
different
in
german
the
whole
series
of
phonetic
changes
comprised
under
the
term
umlaut
of
which
and
written
are
but
specific
examples
struck
the
german
language
at
a
time
when
the
general
drift
to
morphological
simplification
was
not
so
strong
but
that
the
resulting
formal
types
to
fall

of
horns

house
could
keep
themselves
intact
and
even
extend
to

did
not
legitimately

within
their
sphere

umlaut
is
still
a
very
live
symbolic
process

german

more
alive

in
medieval

is

the

that

may
be

learned

can
almost
estimate
the

spread
of

by
taking
note
of
the
extent
to
which
their
vocabularies
have
filtered
into
those
of
other

we
realize
that
an
educated
japanese
can
hardly
frame
a

literary
sentence
without
the
use
of
chinese
resources
that
to
this

siamese

cambodgian
bear
the
unmistakable
imprint
of
the
sanskrit
and

that
came
in
with
hindu
buddhism
centuries
ago
or
that
whether
we
argue
for
or
against
the
teaching
of
latin
and
greek
our
argument
is
sure
to
be
studded
with
words
that
have
come
to
us
from
rome
and
athens
we
get
some
inkling
of
what
early
chinese
culture
and
buddhism
and
classical
mediterranean
civilization
have
meant
in
the
world
history
there
are
just
five
languages
that
have
had
an
overwhelming
significance
as
carriers
of
culture
they
are
classical
chinese
sanskrit
arabic
greek
and
latin
in
comparison
with
these
even
such
culturally
important
languages
as
hebrew
and
french
sink
into
a
secondary
position
it
is
a
little
disappointing
to
learn
that
the
general
cultural
influence
of
english
has
so
far
been
all
but
negligible
the
english
language
itself
is
spreading
because
the
english
have
colonized
immense
territories
but
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
it
is
anywhere
entering
into
the
lexical
heart
of
other
languages
as
french
has
colored
the
english
complexion
or
as
arabic
has
permeated
persian
and
turkish
this
fact
alone
is
significant
of
the
power
of
nationalism
cultural
as
well
as
political
during
the
last
century
there
are
now
psychological
resistances
to
borrowing
or
rather
to
new
sources
of
borrowing
that
were
not
greatly
alive
in
the
middle
ages
or
during
the
renaissance
footnote
for
we
still
name
our
new
scientific
instruments
and
patent
medicines
from
greek
and
latin
are
there
resistances
of
a
more
intimate
nature
to
the
borrowing
of
words
it
is
generally
assumed
that
the
nature
and
extent
of
borrowing
depend
entirely
on
the
historical
facts
of
culture
relation
that
if
german
for
instance
has
borrowed
less
copiously
than
english
from
latin
and
french
it
is
only
because
germany
has
had
less
intimate
relations
than
england
with
the
culture
spheres
of
classical
rome
and
france
this
is
true
to
a
considerable
extent
but
it
is
not
the
whole
truth
we
must
not
exaggerate
the
physical
importance
of
the
norman
invasion
nor
underrate
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
central
geographical
position
made
it
peculiarly
sensitive
to
french
influences
all
through
the
middle
ages
to
humanistic
influences
in
the
latter
fifteenth
and
early
sixteenth
centuries
and
again
to
the
powerful
french
influences
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
it
seems
very
probable
that
the
psychological
attitude
of
the
borrowing
language
itself
towards
linguistic
material
has
much
to
do
with
its
receptivity
to
foreign
words
english
has
long
been
striving
for
the
completely
unified
unanalyzed
word
regardless
of
whether
it
is
monosyllabic
or
polysyllabic
such
words
as
are
entirely
welcome
in
english
because
each
represents
a
unitary
idea
and
because
their
formal
analysis
is
not
a
necessary
act
of
the
unconscious
mind
and
have
no
real
existence
in
english
comparable
to
that
of
in
a
word
like
once
it
is
acclimated
is
nearly
as
simple
a
psychological
entity
as
any
radical
monosyllable
say
in
german
however
polysyllabic
words
strive
to
analyze
themselves
into
significant
elements
hence
vast
numbers
of
french
and
latin
words
borrowed
at
the
height
of
certain
cultural
influences
could
not
maintain
themselves
in
the
language
words
like
credible
and
words
like
to
succeed
offered
nothing
that
the
unconscious
mind
could
assimilate
to
its
customary
method
of
feeling
and
handling
words
it
is
as
though
this
unconscious
mind
said
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
accept
if
you
will
just
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
hence
german
has
generally
found
it
easier
to
create
new
words
out
of
its
own
resources
as
the
necessity
for
them
arose
the
psychological
contrast
between
english
and
german
as
regards
the
treatment
of
foreign
material
is
a
contrast
that
may
be
studied
in
all
parts
of
the
world
the
athabaskan
languages
of
america
are
spoken
by
peoples
that
have
had
astonishingly
varied
cultural
contacts
yet
nowhere
do
we
find
that
an
athabaskan
dialect
has
borrowed
at
all
freely
from
a
neighboring
language
these
languages
have
always
found
it
easier
to
create
new
words
by
compounding
afresh
elements
ready
to
hand
they
have
for
this
reason
been
highly
resistant
to
receiving
the
linguistic
impress
of
the
external
cultural
experiences
of
their
speakers
cambodgian
and
tibetan
offer
a
highly
instructive
contrast
in
their
reaction
to
sanskrit
influence
both
are
analytic
languages
each
totally
different
from
the
inflective
language
of
india
cambodgian
is
isolating
but
unlike
chinese
it
contains
many
polysyllabic
words
whose
etymological
analysis
does
not
matter
like
english
therefore
in
its
relation
to
french
and
latin
it
welcomed
immense
numbers
of
sanskrit
many
of
which
are
in
common
use
there
was
no
psychological
resistance
to
them
classical
tibetan
literature
was
a
slavish
adaptation
of
hindu
buddhist
literature
and
nowhere
has
buddhism
implanted
itself
more
firmly
than
in
tibet
yet
it
is
strange
how
few
sanskrit
words
have
found
their
way
into
the
language
tibetan
was
highly
resistant
to
the
polysyllabic
words
of
sanskrit
because
they
could
not
automatically
fall
into
significant
syllables
as
they
should
have
in
order
to
satisfy
the
tibetan
feeling
for
form
tibetan
was
therefore
driven
to
translating
the
great
majority
of
these
sanskrit
words
into
native
equivalents
the
tibetan
craving
for
form
was
satisfied
though
the
literally
translated
foreign
terms
must
often
have
done
violence
to
genuine
tibetan
idiom
even
the
proper
names
of
the
sanskrit
originals
were
carefully
translated
element
for
element
into
tibetan
was
carefully
tibetanized
into
the
heart
or
essence
of
the
sun
the
study
of
how
a
language
reacts
to
the
presence
of
foreign
words
rejecting
them
translating
them
or
freely
accepting
them
may
throw
much
valuable
light
on
its
innate
formal
tendencies

all
the

all
the

do
influence
each

in
phonetic
respects
and
that
quite
aside
from
the
taking
over
of
foreign
sounds
with

one
of
the
most
curious
facts
that
linguistics
has
to
note
is
the
occurrence
of
striking
phonetic
parallels
in
totally

very
remotely

these
parallels
become
especially
impressive

they
are

contrastively
from
a
wide
phonetic
perspective
here
are
a

examples
the
germanic
languages
as
a
whole
have
not
developed
nasalized
vowels

only
accidental
that
these
dialects
are
spoken
in
proximity
to
french
which
makes
abundant
use
of
nasalized
vowels
again
there
are
certain
general
phonetic
features
that
mark
off
dutch
and
flemish
in
contrast
say
to
north
german
and
scandinavian
dialects
one
of
these
is
the
presence
of
unaspirated
voiceless
stops
which
have
a
precise
metallic
quality
reminiscent
of
the
corresponding
french
sounds
but
which
contrast
with
the
stronger
aspirated
stops
of
english
north
german
and
danish
even
if
we
assume
that
the
unaspirated
stops
are
more
archaic
that
they
are
the
unmodified
descendants
of
the
old
germanic
consonants
is
it
not
perhaps
a
significant
historical
fact
that
the
dutch
dialects
neighbors
of
french
were
inhibited
from
modifying
these
consonants
in
accordance
with
what
seems
to
have
been
a
general
germanic
phonetic
drift
even
more
striking
than
these
instances
is
the
peculiar
resemblance
in
certain
special
phonetic
respects
of
russian
and
other
slavic
languages
to
the
unrelated
languages
of
the
volga
region
the
peculiar
dull
vowel
for
instance
known
in
russian
as
yeri
has
analogues
but
is
entirely
wanting
in
germanic
greek
armenian
and
the
nearest
congeners
of
slavic
we
may
at
least
suspect
that
the
slavic
vowel
is
not
historically
unconnected
with
its
parallels
one
of
the
most
puzzling
cases
of
phonetic
parallelism
is
afforded
by
a
large
number
of
american
indian
languages
spoken
west
of
the
rockies
even
at
the
most
radical
estimate
there
are
at
least
four
totally
unrelated
linguistic
stocks
represented
in
the
region
from
southern
alaska
to
central
california
nevertheless
all
or
practically
all
the
languages
of
this
immense
area
have
some
important
phonetic
features
in
common
chief
of
these
is
the
presence
of
a
glottalized
series
of
stopped
consonants
of
very
distinctive
formation
and
of
quite
unusual
acoustic
effect
in
the
northern
part
of
the
area
all
the
languages
whether
related
or
not
also
possess
various
voiceless
and
a
series
of
velar
stopped
consonants
which
are
etymologically
distinct
from
the
ordinary
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
three
such
peculiar
phonetic
features
as
i
have
mentioned
could
have
evolved
independently
in
neighboring
groups
of
languages
footnote
and
turkish
tartar
footnote
probably
in
sweet
terminology
or
better
between
back
and
mixed
positions
it
generally
corresponds
to
an
long
footnote
there
seem
to
be
analogous
or
partly
analogous
sounds
in
certain
languages
of
the
caucasus
how
are
we
to
explain
these
and
hundreds
of
similar
phonetic
convergences
in
particular
cases
we
may
really
be
dealing
with
archaic
similarities
due
to
a
genetic
relationship
that
it
is
beyond
our
present
power
to
demonstrate
but
this
interpretation
will
not
get
us
far
it
must
be
ruled
entirely
out
of
court
for
instance
in
two
of
the
three
european
examples
i
have
instanced
both
nasalized
vowels
and
the
slavic
yeri
are
demonstrably
of
secondary
origin
in
however
we
envisage
the
process
in
detail
we
can
not
avoid
the
inference
that
there
is
a
tendency
for
speech
sounds
or
certain
distinctive
manners
of
articulation
to
spread
over
a
continuous
area
in
somewhat
the
same
way
that
elements
of
culture
ray
out
from
a
geographical
center
we
may
suppose
that
individual
variations
arising
at
linguistic
borderlands
whether
by
the
unconscious
suggestive
influence
of
foreign
speech
habits
or
by
the
actual
transfer
of
foreign
sounds
into
the
speech
of
bilingual
individuals
have
gradually
been
incorporated
into
the
phonetic
drift
of
a
language
so
long
as
its
main
phonetic
concern
is
the
preservation
of
its
sound
patterning
not
of
its
sounds
as
such
there
is
really
no
reason
why
a
language
may
not
unconsciously
assimilate
foreign
sounds
that
have
succeeded
in
worming
their
way
into
its
gamut
of
individual
variations
provided
always
that
these
new
variations
or
reinforced
old
variations
are
in
the
direction
of
the
native
drift
a
simple
illustration
will
throw
light
on
this
conception
let
us
suppose
that
two
neighboring
and
unrelated
languages
a
and
b
each
possess
voiceless
compare
welsh
we
surmise
that
this
is
not
an
accident
perhaps
comparative
study
reveals
the
fact
that
in
language
a
the
voiceless
correspond
to
a
sibilant
series
in
other
related
languages
that
an
old
alternation
has
been
shifted
to
the
new
alternation
voiceless
does
it
follow
that
the
voiceless
of
language
b
has
had
the
same
history
not
in
the
least
perhaps
b
has
a
strong
tendency
toward
audible
breath
release
at
the
end
of
a
word
so
that
the
final
like
a
final
vowel
was
originally
followed
by
a
marked
aspiration
individuals
perhaps
tended
to
anticipate
a
little
the
voiceless
release
and
to
unvoice
the
latter
part
of
the
final
very
much
as
the
of
english
words
like
tends
to
be
partly
voiceless
in
anticipation
of
the
voicelessness
of
the
yet
this
final
with
its
latent
tendency
to
unvoicing
might
never
have
actually
developed
into
a
fully
voiceless
had
not
the
presence
of
voiceless
in
a
acted
as
an
unconscious
stimulus
or
suggestive
push
toward
a
more
radical
change
in
the
line
of
b
own
drift
once
the
final
voiceless
emerged
its
alternation
in
related
words
with
medial
voiced
is
very
likely
to
have
led
to
its
analogical
spread
the
result
would
be
that
both
a
and
b
have
an
important
phonetic
trait
in
common
eventually
their
phonetic
systems
judged
as
mere
assemblages
of
sounds
might
even
become
completely
assimilated
to
each
other
though
this
is
an
extreme
case
hardly
ever
realized
in
practice
the
highly
significant
thing
about
such
phonetic
interinfluencings
is
the
strong
tendency
of
each
language
to
keep
its
phonetic
pattern
intact
so
long
as
the
respective
alignments
of
the
similar
sounds
is
different
so
long
as
they
have
differing
values
and
weights
in
the
unrelated
languages
these
languages
can
not
be
said
to
have
diverged
materially
from
the
line
of
their
inherent
drift
in
phonetics
as
in
vocabulary
we
must
be
careful
not
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
interlinguistic
influences
footnote
this
can
actually
be
demonstrated
for
one
of
the
athabaskan
dialects
of
the
yukon
i
have
already
pointed
out
in
passing
that
english
has
taken
over
a
certain
number
of
morphological
elements
from
french
english
also
uses
a
number
of
affixes
that
are
derived
from
latin
and
greek
some
of
these
foreign
elements
like
the
of
or
the
of
are
even
productive
such
examples
as
these
are
hardly
true
evidences
of
a
morphological
influence
exerted
by
one
language
on
another
setting
aside
the
fact
that
they
belong
to
the
sphere
of
derivational
concepts
and
do
not
touch
the
central
morphological
problem
of
the
expression
of
relational
ideas
they
have
added
nothing
to
the
structural
peculiarities
of
our
language
english
was
already
prepared
for
the
relation
of
to
by
such
a
native
pair
as
and
and
merely
swelled
the
ranks
of
a
form

familiar
from
such
instances
as
and
in
other
words
the
morphological
influence
exerted
by
foreign
languages
on
english
if
it
is
to
be
gauged
by
such
examples
as
i
have
cited
is
hardly
different
in
kind
from
the
mere
borrowing
of
words
the
introduction
of
the
suffix
made
hardly
more
difference
to
the
essential
build
of
the
language
than
did
the
mere
fact
that
it
incorporated
a
given
number
of
words
had
english
evolved
a
new
future
on
the
model
of
the
synthetic
future
in
french
or
had
it
borrowed
from
latin
and
greek
their
employment
of
reduplication
as
a
functional
device
latin
greek
we
should
have
the
right
to
speak
of
true
morphological
influence
but
such
influences
are
not
demonstrable
within
the
whole
course
of
the
history
of
the
english
language
we
can
hardly
point
to
one
important
morphological
change
that
was
not
determined
by
the
native
drift
though
here
and
there
we
may
surmise
that
this
drift
was
hastened
a
little
by
the
suggestive
influence
of
french
forms
footnote
in
the
sphere
of
syntax
one
may
point
to
certain
french
and
latin
influences
but
it
is
doubtful
if
they
ever
reached
deeper
than
the
written
language
much
of
this
type
of
influence
belongs
rather
to
literary
style
than
to
morphology
proper
it
is
important
to
realize
the
continuous
morphological
development
of
english
and
the
very
modest
extent
to
which
its
fundamental
build
has
been
affected
by
influences
from
without
the
history
of
the
english
language
has
sometimes
been
represented
as
though
it
relapsed
into
a
kind
of
chaos
on
the
arrival
of
the
normans
who
proceeded
to
play
with
the
tradition
students
are
more
conservative
today
that
a
analytic
development
may
take
place
without
such
external
foreign
influence
as
english
was
subjected
to
is
clear
from
the
history
of
danish
which
has
gone
even
further
than
english
in
certain
leveling
tendencies
english
may
be
conveniently
used
as
an
test
it
was
flooded
with
french
during
the
later
middle
ages
at
a
time
when
its
drift
toward
the
analytic
type
was
especially
strong
it
was
therefore
changing
rapidly
both
within
and
on
the
surface
the
wonder
then
is
not
that
it
took
on
a
number
of
external
morphological
features
mere
accretions
on
its
concrete
inventory
but
that
exposed
as
it
was
to
remolding
influences
it
remained
so
true
to
its
own
type
and
historic
drift
the
experience
gained
from
the
study
of
the
english
language
is
strengthened
by
all
that
we
know
of
documented
linguistic
history
nowhere
do
we
find
any
but
superficial
morphological
interinfluencings
we
may
infer
one
of
several
things
from
this
that
a
really
serious
morphological
influence
is
not
perhaps
impossible
but
that
its
operation
is
so
slow
that
it
has
hardly
ever
had
the
chance
to
incorporate
itself
in
the
relatively
small
portion
of
linguistic
history
that
lies
open
to
inspection
or
that
there
are
certain
favorable
conditions
that
make
for
profound
morphological
disturbances
from
without
say
a
peculiar
instability
of
linguistic
type
or
an
unusual
degree
of
cultural
contact
conditions
that
do
not
happen
to
be
realized
in
our
documentary
material
or
finally
that
we
have
not
the
right
to
assume
that
a
language
may
easily
exert
a
remolding
morphological
influence
on
another
meanwhile
we
are
confronted
by
the
baffling
fact
that
important
traits
of
morphology
are
frequently
found
distributed
among
widely
differing
languages
within
a
large
area
so
widely
differing
indeed
that
it
is
customary
to
consider
them
genetically
unrelated
sometimes
we
may
suspect
that
the
resemblance
is
due
to
a
mere
convergence
that
a
similar
morphological
feature
has
grown
up
independently
in
unrelated
languages
yet
certain
morphological
distributions
are
too
specific
in
character
to
be
so
lightly
dismissed
there
must
be
some
historical
factor
to
account
for
them
now
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
concept
of
a
linguistic
stock
is
never
definitive
in
an
exclusive
sense
we
can
only
say
with
reasonable
certainty
that
such
and
such
languages
are
descended
from
a
common
source
but
we
can
not
say
that
such
and
such
other
languages
are
not
genetically
related
all
we
can
do
is
to
say
that
the
evidence
for
relationship
is
not
cumulative
enough
to
make
the
inference
of
common
origin
absolutely
necessary
may
it
not
be
then
that
many
instances
of
morphological
similarity
between
divergent
languages
of
a
restricted
area
are
merely
the
last
vestiges
of
a
community
of
type
and
phonetic
substance
that
the
destructive
work
of
diverging
drifts
has
now
made
unrecognizable
there
is
probably
still
enough
lexical
and
morphological
resemblance
between
modern
english
and
irish
to
enable
us
to
make
out
a
fairly
conclusive
case
for
their
genetic
relationship
on
the
basis
of
the
descriptive
evidence
alone
it
is
true
that
the
case
would
seem
weak
in
comparison
to
the
case
that
we
can
actually
make
with
the
help
of
the
historical
and
the
comparative
data
that
we
possess
it
would
not
be
a
bad
case
nevertheless
in
another
two
or
three
millennia
however
the
points
of
resemblance
are
likely
to
have
become
so
obliterated
that
english
and
irish
in
the
absence
of
all
but
their
own
descriptive
evidence
will
have
to
be
set
down
as
unrelated
languages
they
will
still
have
in
common
certain
fundamental
morphological
features
but
it
will
be
difficult
to
know
how
to
evaluate
them
only
in
the
light
of
the
contrastive
perspective
afforded
by
still
more
divergent
languages
such
as
basque
and
finnish
will
these
vestigial
resemblances
receive
their
true
historic
value

the

feels
himself
to
be

of
which
race
has
fashioned
the
english

and
the

which

the
expression
science

it
inquires
if
these
three
types

racial
linguistic
and

congruent
if
their
association
is
an
inherently
necessary
one
or
is
merely
a
matter
of
external

the
answer
to
the
inquiry
is
not
encouraging
to
race
sentimentalists
historians
and
anthropologists
find
that
races
languages
and
cultures
are
not
distributed
in
parallel
fashion
that
their
areas
of
distribution
intercross
in
the
most
bewildering
fashion
and
that
the
history
of
each
is
apt
to
follow
a
distinctive
course
races
intermingle
in
a
way
that
languages
do
not
on
the
other
hand
languages
may
spread
far
beyond
their
original
home
invading
the
territory
of
new
races
and
of
new
culture
spheres
a
language
may
even
die
out
in
its
primary
area
and
live
on
among
peoples
violently
hostile
to
the
persons
of
its
original
speakers
further
the
accidents
of
history
are
constantly
rearranging
the
borders
of
culture
areas
without
necessarily
effacing
the
existing
linguistic
cleavages
if
we
can
once
thoroughly
convince
ourselves
that
race
in
its
only
intelligible
that
is
biological
sense
is
supremely
indifferent
to
the
history
of
languages
and
cultures
that
these
are
no
more
directly
explainable
on
the
score
of
race
than
on
that
of
the
laws
of
physics
and
chemistry
we
shall
have
gained
a
viewpoint
that
allows
a
certain
interest
to
such
mystic
slogans
as
slavophilism
teutonism
and
the
latin
genius
but
that
quite
refuses
to
be
taken
in
by
any
of
them
a
careful
study
of
linguistic
distributions
and
of
the
history
of
such
distributions
is
one
of
the
driest
of
commentaries
on
these
sentimental
creeds
that
a
group
of
languages
need
not
in
the
least
correspond
to
a
racial
group
or
a
culture
area
is
easily
demonstrated
we
may
even
show
how
a
single
language
intercrosses
with
race
and
culture
lines
the
english
language
is
not
spoken
by
a
unified
race
in
the
united

there
are
several
millions
of
negroes
who
know
no
other

it
is
their
the
formal
vesture
of
their
inmost
thoughts
and
sentiments
it
is
as
much
their
property
as
inalienably
theirs
as
the
king
of
england
nor
do
the
whites
of
america
constitute
a
definite
race
except
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
negroes
of
the
three
fundamental
white
races
in
europe
generally
recognized
by
physical
anthropologists
the
baltic

north
european
the
alpine

the
mediterranean

has
numerous
representatives
in

but
does
not
the
historical
core
of
peoples
those
relatively
unmixed
populations
that
still
reside
in
england
and
its
colonies
represent
a
race
pure
and
single
i
can
not
see
that
the
evidence
points
that
way

an
amalgam

celtic

if
by
english
we
mean
also
scotch
and
irish
then
the
term
celtic
is
loosely
used
for
at
least
two
quite
distinct
racial
elements
the
short
type
of
wales
and
the
taller

type
of
the

even
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
the
saxon
element
which
needless
to
say
nowhere
appears
pure
we
are
not
at
the
end

we
may
roughly
identify
this
strain
with
the
racial
type
now
predominant
in
southern
denmark
and
adjoining
parts
of
northern
germany
if
so
we
must
content
ourselves
with
the
reflection

the
english

most
closely
affiliated
with

was
largely
the

as

now

by
the

speak
a

the
celtic

of
what
is
now
england

wales
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the

wales

until
recently
cornwall
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the

tribes
angles

jutes
did
not
exterminate
the
brythonic

the
high
german
now
spoken
in
northern
germany
is
not
of
great
age
but
is
due
to
the
spread
of
standardized
german
based
on
upper
saxon
a
high
german
dialect
at
the
expense
of
plattdeutsch
but
what
if
we
ignore
these
finer
distinctions
and
simply
assume
that
the
teutonic
or
baltic
or
north
european
racial

coincided
in
its
distribution
with
that

the

of
france
the
french

many
of
the
western

the
distribution
of
these

corresponds
in

to
that
of
the

well
to
avoid
speaking

if
we
were

to
give
the

content
it
would
probably
be
more
appropriate
to
apply
it
to
roughly
the
western

of
the
alpine

to
the
two

that
i
referred

that
the

of

between

britain
and
the

is
far
from
arguing
a
like
community
of
culture
it
is
customary
to
say
that
they
possess
a
common
cultural
heritage
but
are
not
many
significant
differences
in
life
and
feeling
obscured
by
the
tendency
of
the
cultured
to
take
this
common
heritage
too
much
for
granted
in
so
far
as
america
is
still
specifically
english
it
is
only
colonially
or
vestigially
so
its
prevailing
cultural
drift
is
partly
towards
autonomous
and
distinctive
developments
partly
towards
immersion
in
the
larger
european
culture
of
which
that
of
england
is
only
a
particular
facet
we
can
not
deny
that
the
possession
of
a
common
language
is
still
and
will
long
continue
to
be
a
smoother
of
the
way
to
a
mutual
cultural
understanding
between
england
and
america
but
it
is
very
clear
that
other
factors
some
of
them
rapidly
cumulative
are
working
powerfully
to
counteract
this
leveling
influence
a
common
language
can
not
indefinitely
set
the
seal
on
a
common
culture
when
the
geographical
political
and
economic
determinants
of
the
culture
are
no
longer
the
same
throughout
its
area
language
race
and
culture
are
not
necessarily
correlated
this
does
not
mean
that
they
never
are
there
is
some
tendency
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
racial
and
cultural
lines
of
cleavage
to
correspond
to
linguistic
ones
though
in
any
given
case
the
latter
may
not
be
of
the
same
degree
of
importance
as
the
others
thus
there
is
a
fairly
definite
line
of
cleavage
between
the
polynesian
languages
race
and
culture
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
the
melanesians
on
the
other
in
spite
of
a
considerable
amount
of
overlapping
the
racial
and
cultural
division
however
particularly
the
former
are
of
major
importance
while
the
linguistic
division
is
of
quite
minor
significance
the
polynesian
languages
constituting
hardly
more
than
a
special
dialectic
subdivision
of
the
combined
group
still
coincidences
of
cleavage
may
be
found
the
language
race
and
culture
of
the
eskimo
are
markedly
distinct
from
those
of
their
neighbors
in
southern
africa
the
language
race
and
culture
of
the
bushmen
offer
an
even
stronger
contrast
to
those
of
their
bantu
neighbors
coincidences
of
this
sort
are
of
the
greatest
significance
of
course
but
this
significance
is
not
one
of
inherent
psychological
relation
between
the
three
factors
of
race
language
and
culture
the
coincidences
of
cleavage
point
merely
to
a
readily
intelligible
historical
association
if
the
bantu
and
bushmen
are
so
sharply
differentiated
in
all
respects
the
reason
is
simply
that
the
former
are
relatively
recent
arrivals
in
southern
africa
the
two
peoples
developed
in
complete
isolation
from
each
other
their
present
propinquity
is
too
recent
for
the
slow
process
of
cultural
and
racial
assimilation
to
have
set
in
very
powerfully
as
we
go
back
in
time
we
shall
have
to
assume
that
relatively
scanty
populations
occupied
large
territories
for
untold
generations
and
that
contact
with
other
masses
of
population
was
not
as
insistent
and
prolonged
as
it
later
became
the
geographical
and
historical
isolation
that
brought
about
race
differentiations
was
naturally
favorable
also
to
variations
in
language
and
culture
the
very
fact
that
races
and
cultures
which
are
brought
into
historical
contact
tend
to
assimilate
in
the
long
run
while
neighboring
languages
assimilate
each
other
only
casually
and
in
superficial
respects
indicates
that
there
is
no
profound
causal
relation
between
the
development
of
language
and
the
specific
development
of
race
and
of
culture

even
here
there
is
some
significant
overlapping
the

were
assimilated
in

footnote
the
supersession
of
one
language
by
another
is
of
course
not
truly
a
matter
of
linguistic
assimilation
but
surely
the
wary
reader
will
object
there
must
be
some
relation
between
language
and
culture
and
between
language
and
at
least
that
intangible
aspect
of
race
that
we
call
temperament
is
it
not
inconceivable
that
the
particular
collective
qualities
of
mind
that
have
fashioned
a
culture
are
not
precisely
the
same
as
were
responsible
for
the
growth
of
a
particular
linguistic
morphology
this
question
takes
us
into
the
heart
of
the
most
difficult
problems
of
social
psychology
it
is
doubtful
if
any
one
has
yet
attained
to
sufficient
clarity
on
the
nature
of
the
historical
process
and
on
the
ultimate
psychological
factors
involved
in
linguistic
and
cultural
drifts
to
answer
it
intelligently
i
can
only
very
briefly
set
forth
my
own
views
or
rather
my
general
attitude
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
that
temperament
the
general
emotional
disposition
of
a
people
is
basically
responsible
for
the
slant
and
drift
of
a
culture
however
much
it
may
manifest
itself
in
an
individual
handling
of
the
elements
of
that
culture
but
granted
that
temperament
has
a
certain
value
for
the
shaping
of
culture
difficult
though
it
be
to
say
just
how
it
does
not
follow
that
it
has
the
same
value
for
the
shaping
of
language
it
is
impossible
to
show
that
the
form
of
a
language
has
the
slightest
connection
with
national
temperament
its
line
of
variation
its
drift
runs
inexorably
in
the
channel
ordained
for
it
by
its
historic
antecedents
it
is
as
regardless
of
the
feelings
and
sentiments
of
its
speakers
as
is
the
course
of
a
river
of
the
atmospheric
humors
of
the
landscape
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
futile
to
look
in
linguistic
structure
for
differences
corresponding
to
the
temperamental
variations
which
are
supposed
to
be
correlated
with
race
in
this
connection
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
emotional
aspect
of
our
psychic
life
is
but
meagerly
expressed
in
the
build
of
language
footnote
temperament
is
a
difficult
term
to
work
with
a
great
deal
of
what
is
loosely
charged
to
national
temperament
is
really
nothing
but
customary
behavior
the
effect
of
traditional
ideals
of
conduct
in
a
culture
for
instance
that
does
not
look
kindly
upon
demonstrativeness
the
natural
tendency
to
the
display
of
emotion
becomes
more
than
normally
inhibited
it
would
be
quite
misleading
to
argue
from
the
customary
inhibition
a
cultural
fact
to
the
native
temperament
but
ordinarily
we
can
get
at
human
conduct
only
as
it
is
culturally
modified
temperament
in
the
raw
is
a
highly
elusive
thing

language
and
our
are
inextricably
interwoven
are
in
a
sense
one
and
the
same
as
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
are
significant
racial
differences
in
the
fundamental
conformation
of
thought
it
follows
that
the
infinite
variability
of
linguistic
form
another
name
for
the
infinite
variability
of
the
actual
process
of
thought
can
not
be
an
index
of
such
significant
racial
differences
this
is
only
apparently
a
paradox
the
latent
content
of
all
languages
is
the
same
the
intuitive
of
experience
it
is
the
manifest
form
that
is
never
twice
the
same
for
this
form
which
we
call
linguistic
morphology
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
collective
of
thought
an
art
denuded
of
the
irrelevancies
of
individual
sentiment
at
last
analysis
then
language
can
no
more
flow
from
race
as
such
than
can
the
sonnet
form
nor
can
i
believe
that
culture
and
language
are
in
any
true
sense
causally
related
culture
may
be
defined
as
a
society
does
and
thinks
language
is
a
particular
of
thought
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
particular
causal
relations
may
be
expected
to
subsist
between
a
selected
inventory
of
experience
culture
a
significant
selection
made
by
society
and
the
particular
manner
in
which
the
society
expresses
all
experience
the
drift
of
culture
another
way
of
saying
history
is
a
complex
series
of
changes
in
society
selected
inventory
additions
losses
changes
of
emphasis
and
relation
the
drift
of
language
is
not
properly
concerned
with
changes
of
content
at
all
merely
with
changes
in
formal
expression
it
is
possible
in
thought
to
change
every
sound
word
and
concrete
concept
of
a
language
without
changing
its
inner
actuality
in
the
least
just
as
one
can
pour
into
a
fixed
mold
water
or
plaster
or
molten
gold
if
it
can
be
shown
that
culture
has
an
innate
form
a
series
of
contours
quite
apart
from
of
any
description
whatsoever
we
have
a
something
in
culture
that
may
serve
as
a
term
of
comparison
with
and
possibly
a
means
of
relating
it
to
language
but
until
such
purely
formal
patterns
of
culture
are
discovered
and
laid
bare
we
shall
do
well
to
hold
the
drifts
of
language
and
of
culture
to
be
and
unrelated
processes
from
this
it
follows
that
all
attempts
to
connect
particular
types
of
linguistic
morphology
with
certain
correlated
stages
of
cultural
development
are
vain
rightly
understood
such
correlations
are
rubbish
the
merest
verifies
our
theoretical
argument
on
this
point
both
simple
and
complex
types
of
language
of
an
indefinite
number
of
varieties
may
be
found
spoken
at
any
desired
level
of
cultural
advance
when
it
comes
to
linguistic
form
plato
walks
with
the
macedonian
swineherd
confucius
with
the
savage
of
assam
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
mere
content
of
language
is
intimately
related
to
culture
a
society
that
has
no
knowledge
of
theosophy
need
have
no
name
for
it
aborigines
that
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
horse
were
compelled
to
invent
or
borrow
a
word
for
the
animal
when
they
made
his
acquaintance
in
the
sense
that
the
vocabulary
of
a
language
more
or
less
faithfully
reflects
the
culture
whose
purposes
it
serves
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
history
of
language
and
the
history
of
culture
move
along
parallel
lines
but
this
superficial
and
extraneous
kind
of
parallelism
is
of
no
real
interest
to
the
linguist
except
in
so
far
as
the
growth
or
borrowing
of
new
words
incidentally
throws
light
on
the
formal
trends
of
the
language
the
linguistic
student
should
never
make
the
mistake
of
identifying
a
language
with
its
dictionary
if
both
this
and
the
preceding
chapter
have
been
largely
negative
in
their
contentions
i
believe
that
they
have
been
healthily
so
there
is
perhaps
no
better
way
to
learn
the
essential
nature
of
speech
than
to
realize
what
it
is
not
and
what
it
does
not
do
its
superficial
connections
with
other
historic
processes
are
so
close
that
it
needs
to
be
shaken
free
of
them
if
we
are
to
see
it
in
its
own
right
everything
that
we
have
so
far
seen
to
be
true
of
language
points
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
most
significant
and
colossal
work
that
the
human
spirit
has
evolved
nothing
short
of
a
finished
form
of
expression
for
all
communicable
experience
this
form
may
be
endlessly
varied
by
the
individual
without
thereby
losing
its
distinctive
contours
and
it
is
constantly
reshaping
itself
as
is
all

language
is
the
most
massive
and
inclusive
art

know
a
mountainous
and
anonymous

generations
xi
language
and
literature
languages
are
more
to
us
than
systems
of
they
are
invisible
garments
that
drape
themselves
about
our
spirit
and
give
a
predetermined
form
to
all
its
symbolic
expression
when
the
expression
is
of
unusual
significance
we
call
it
literature
art
is
so
personal
an
expression
that
we
do
not
like
to
feel
that
it
is
bound
to
predetermined
form
of
any
sort
the
possibilities
of
individual
expression
are
infinite
language
in
particular
is
the
most
fluid
of
mediums
yet
some
limitation
there
must
be
to
this
freedom
some
resistance
of
the
medium
in
great
art
there
is
the
illusion
of
absolute
freedom
the
formal
restraints
imposed
by
the
material
paint
black
and
white
marble
piano
tones
or
whatever
it
may
be
are
not
perceived
it
is
as
though
there
were
a
limitless
margin
of
between
the
artist
fullest
utilization
of
form
and
the
most
that
the
material
is
innately
capable
of
the
artist
has
intuitively
surrendered
to
the
inescapable
tyranny
of
the
material
made
its
brute
nature
fuse
easily
with
his
conception
the
material
disappears
precisely
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
artist
conception
to
indicate
that
any
other
material
exists
for
the
time
being
he
and
we
with
him
move
in
the
artistic
medium
as
a
fish
moves
in
the
water
oblivious
of
the
existence
of
an
alien
atmosphere
no
sooner
however
does
the
artist
transgress
the
law
of
his
medium
than
we
realize
with
a
start
that
there
is
a
medium
to
obey
footnote
i
can
hardly
stop
to
define
just
what
kind
of
expression
is
significant
enough
to
be
called
art
or
literature

i
do
not
exactly
know
we
shall
have
to
take
literature
for
granted
footnote
this
intuitive
surrender
has
nothing
to
do
with
subservience
to
artistic
convention
more
than
one
revolt
in
modern
art
has
been
dominated
by
the
desire
to
get
out
of
the
material
just
what
it
is
really
capable
of
the
impressionist
wants
light
and
color
because
paint
can
give
him
just
these
literature
in
painting
the
sentimental
suggestion
of
a
story
is
offensive
to
him
because
he
does
not
want
the
virtue
of
his
particular
form
to
be
dimmed
by
shadows
from
another
medium
similarly
the
poet
as
never
before
insists
that
words
mean
just
what
they
really
mean
language
is
the
medium
of
literature
as
marble
or
bronze
or
clay
are
the
materials
of
the
sculptor
since
every
language
has
its
distinctive
peculiarities
the
innate
formal
limitations
and
possibilities
of
one
literature
are
never
quite
the
same
as
those
of
another
the
literature
fashioned
out
of
the
form
and
substance
of
a
language
has
the
color
and
the
texture
of
its
matrix
the
literary
artist
may
never
be
conscious
of
just
how
he
is
hindered
or
helped
or
otherwise
guided
by
the
matrix
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
translating
his
work
into
another
language
the
nature
of
the
original
matrix
manifests
itself
at
once
all
his
effects
have
been
calculated
or
intuitively
felt
with
reference
to
the
formal
genius
of
his
own
language
they
can
not
be
carried
over
without
loss
or
modification
croce
is
therefore
perfectly
right
in
saying
that
a
work
of
literary
art
can
never
be
translated
nevertheless
literature
does
get
itself
translated
sometimes
with
astonishing
adequacy
this
brings
up
the
question
whether
in
the
art
of
literature
there
are
not
intertwined
two
distinct
kinds
or
levels
of
art
a
generalized
art
which
can
be
transferred
without
loss
into
an
alien
linguistic
medium
and
a
specifically
linguistic
art
that
is
not
transferable
i
believe
the
distinction
is
entirely
valid
though
we
never
get
the
two
levels
pure
in
practice
literature
moves
in
language
as
a
medium
but
that
medium
comprises
two
layers
the
latent
content
of
language
our
intuitive
record
of
experience
and
the
particular
conformation
of
a
given
language
the
specific
how
of
our
record
of
experience
literature
that
draws
its
sustenance
mainly
never
entirely
from
the
lower
level
say
a
play
of
shakespeare
is
translatable
without
too
great
a
loss
of
character
if
it
moves
in
the
upper
rather
than
in
the
lower
level
a
fair
example
is
a
lyric
of
swinburne
it
is
as
good
as
untranslatable
both
types
of
literary
expression
may
be
great
or
mediocre

the
question
of
the
transferability
of
art
productions
seems
to
me
to
be
of
genuine
theoretic
interest
for
all
that
we
speak
of
the
sacrosanct
uniqueness
of
a
given
art
work
we
know
very
well
though
we
do
not
always
admit
it
that
not
all
productions
are
equally
intractable
to
transference
a

is
inviolate
it
moves
altogether

of

tone
a
bach
fugue
is
transferable
into
another
set
of
musical
timbres
without
serious
loss
of
esthetic
significance
chopin
plays
with
the
language
of
the
piano
as
though
no
other
language
existed
the
medium
disappears
bach
speaks
the
language
of
the
piano
as
a
handy
means
of
giving
outward
expression
to
a
conception
wrought
in
the
generalized
language
of
tone
there
is
really
no
mystery
in
the
distinction
it
can
be
clarified
a
little
by
comparing
literature
with
science
a
scientific
truth
is
impersonal
in
its
essence
it
is
untinctured
by
the
particular
linguistic
medium
in
which
it
finds
expression
it
can
as
readily
deliver
its
message
in
chinese
as
in
english
nevertheless
it
must
have
some
expression
and
that
expression
must
needs
be
a
linguistic
one
indeed
the
apprehension
of
the
scientific
truth
is
itself
a
linguistic
process
for
thought
is
nothing
but
language
denuded
of
its
outward
garb
the
proper
medium
of
scientific
expression
is
therefore
a
generalized
language
that
may
be
defined
as
a
symbolic
algebra
of
which
all
known
languages
are
translations
one
can
adequately
translate
scientific
literature
because
the
original
scientific
expression
is
itself
a
translation
literary
expression
is
personal
and
concrete
but
this
does
not
mean
that
its
significance
is
altogether
bound
up
with
the
accidental
qualities
of
the
medium
a
truly
deep
symbolism
for
instance
does
not
depend
on
the
verbal
associations
of
a
particular
language
but
rests
securely
on
an
intuitive
basis
that
underlies
all
linguistic
expression
the
artist
intuition
to
use
croce
term
is
immediately
fashioned
out
of
a
generalized
human
experience
thought
and
feeling
of
which
his
own
individual
experience
is
a
highly
personalized
selection
the
thought
relations
in
this
deeper
level
have
no
specific
linguistic
vesture
the
rhythms
are
free
not
bound
in
the
first
instance
to
the
traditional
rhythms
of
the
artist
language
certain
artists
whose
spirit
moves
largely
in
the
better
in
the
generalized
linguistic
layer
even
find
a
certain
difficulty
in
getting
themselves
expressed
in
the
rigidly
set
terms
of
their
accepted
idiom
one
feels
that
they
are
unconsciously
striving
for
a
generalized
art
language
a
literary
algebra
that
is
related
to
the
sum
of
all
known
languages
as
a
perfect
mathematical
symbolism

related
to
all
the
roundabout
reports
of
mathematical
relations

normal

is
capable
of
conveying
their

it
sounds
at
times

these

us

of
the
greatest
diagnostic
value

a

phonetic

it
does

these

may
either
merge
their

the

an

utilize

of
his

he
may
be
thankful
if
the
given
palette
of
colors
is
rich
if
the
springboard
is
light
but
he
deserves
no
special
credit
for
felicities
that
are
the
language
own
we
must
take
for
granted
this
language
with
all
its
qualities
of
flexibility
or
rigidity
and
see
the
artist
work
in
relation
to
it
a
cathedral
on
the
lowlands
is
higher
than
a
stick
on
mont
blanc
in
other
words
we
must
not
commit
the
folly
of
admiring
a
french
sonnet
because
the
vowels
are
more
sonorous
than
our
own
or
of
condemning
nietzsche
prose
because
it
harbors
in
its
texture
combinations
of
consonants
that
would
affright
on
english
soil
to
so
judge
literature
would
be
tantamount
to
loving
tristan
und
isolde
because
one
is
fond
of
the
timbre
of
horns
there
are
certain
things
that
one
language
can
do
supremely
well
which
it
would
be
almost
vain
for
another
to
attempt
generally
there
are
compensations
the
vocalism
of
english
is
an
inherently
drabber
thing
than
the
vowel
scale
of
french
yet
english
compensates
for
this
drawback
by
its
greater
rhythmical
alertness
it
is
even
doubtful
if
the
innate
sonority
of
a
phonetic
system
counts
for
as
much
as
esthetic
determinant
as
the
relations
between
the
sounds
the
total
gamut
of
their
similarities
and
contrasts
as
long
as
the
artist
has
the
wherewithal
to
lay
out
his
sequences
and
rhythms
it
matters
little
what
are
the
sensuous
qualities
of
the
elements
of
his
material
the
phonetic
groundwork
of
a
language
however
is
only
one
of
the
features
that
give
its
literature
a
certain
direction
far
more
important
are
its
morphological
peculiarities
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
for
the
development
of
style
if
the
language
can
or
can
not
create
compound
words
if
its
structure
is
synthetic
or
analytic
if
the
words
of
its
sentences
have
considerable
freedom
of
position
or
are
compelled
to
fall
into
a
rigidly
determined
sequence
the
major
characteristics
of
style
in
so
far
as
style
is
a
technical
matter
of
the
building
and
placing
of
words
are
given
by
the
language
itself
quite
as
inescapably
indeed
as
the
general
acoustic
effect
of
verse
is
given
by
the
sounds
and
natural
accents
of
the
language
these
necessary
fundamentals
of
style
are
hardly
felt
by
the
artist
to
constrain
his
individuality
of
expression
they
rather
point
the
way
to
those
stylistic
developments
that
most
suit
the
natural
bent
of
the
language
it
is
not
in
the
least
likely
that
a
truly
great
style
can
seriously
oppose
itself
to
the
basic
form
patterns
of
the
language
it
not
only
incorporates
them
it
builds
on
them
the
merit
of
such
a
style
as
hudson
or
george
moore
is
that
it
does
with
ease
and
economy
what
the
language
is
always
trying
to
do
carlylese
though
individual
and
vigorous
is
yet
not
style
it
is
a
teutonic
mannerism
nor
is
the
prose
of
milton
and
his
contemporaries
strictly
english
it
is
done
into
magnificent
english
words
footnote
aside
from
individual
peculiarities
of
diction
the
selection
and
evaluation
of
particular
words
as
such
it
is
strange
how
long
it
has
taken
the
european
literatures
to
learn
that
style
is
not
an
absolute
a
something
that
is
to
be
imposed
on
the
language
from
greek
or
latin
models
but
merely
the
language
itself
running
in
its
natural
grooves
and
with
enough
of
an
individual
accent
to
allow
the
artist
personality
to
be
felt
as
a
presence
not
as
an
acrobat
we
understand
more
clearly
now
that
what
is
effective
and
beautiful
in
one
language
is
a
vice
in
another
latin
and
eskimo
with
their
highly
inflected
forms
lend
themselves
to
an
elaborately
periodic
structure
that
would
be
boring
in
english
english
allows
even
demands
a
looseness
that
would
be
insipid
in
chinese
and
chinese
with
its
unmodified
words
and
rigid
sequences
has
a
compactness
of
phrase
a
terse
parallelism
and
a
silent
suggestiveness
that
would
be
too
tart
too
mathematical
for
the
english
genius
while
we
can
not
assimilate
the
luxurious
periods
of
latin
nor
the
pointilliste
style
of
the
chinese
classics
we
can
enter
sympathetically
into
the
spirit
of
these
alien
techniques
i
believe
that
any
english
poet
of
would
be
thankful
for
the
concision
that
a
chinese
poetaster
attains
without
effort

an
example

forces
an
assemblage

form
footnote
china
probably
nothing
better
illustrates
the
formal
dependence
of
literature
on
language
than
the
prosodic
aspect
of
poetry
quantitative
verse
was
entirely
natural
to
the
greeks
not
merely
because
poetry
grew
up
in
connection
with
the
chant
and
the
dance
but
because
alternations
of
long
and
short
syllables
were
keenly
live
facts
in
the
daily
economy
of
the
language
the
tonal
accents
which
were
only
secondarily
stress
phenomena
helped
to
give
the
syllable
its
quantitative
individuality
when
the
greek
meters
were
carried
over
into
latin
verse
there
was
comparatively
little
strain
for
latin
too
was
characterized
by
an
acute
awareness
of
quantitative
distinctions
however
the
latin
accent
was
more
markedly
stressed
than
that
of
greek
probably
therefore
the
purely
quantitative
meters
modeled
after
the
greek
were
felt
as
a
shade
more
artificial
than
in
the
language
of
their
origin
the
attempt
to
cast
english
verse
into
latin
and
greek
molds
has
never
been
successful
the
dynamic
basis
of
english
is
not
quantity
but
stress
the
alternation
of
accented
and
unaccented
syllables
this
fact
gives
english
verse
an
entirely
different
slant
and
has
determined
the
development
of
its
poetic
forms
is
still
responsible
for
the
evolution
of
new
forms
neither
stress
nor
syllabic
weight
is
a
very
keen
psychologic
factor
in
the
dynamics
of
french
the
syllable
has
great
inherent
sonority
and
does
not
fluctuate
significantly
as
to
quantity
and
stress
quantitative
or
accentual
metrics
would
be
as
artificial
in
french
as
stress
metrics
in
classical
greek
or
quantitative
or
purely
syllabic
metrics
in
english
french
prosody
was
compelled
to
develop
on
the
basis
of
unit
assonance
later
rhyme
could
not
but
prove
a
welcome
an
all
but
necessary
means
of
articulating
or
sectioning
the
somewhat
spineless
flow
of
sonorous
syllables
english
was
hospitable
to
the
french
suggestion
of
rhyme
but
did
not
seriously
need
it
in
its
rhythmic
economy
hence
rhyme
has
always
been
strictly
subordinated
to
stress
as
a
somewhat
decorative
feature
and
has
been
frequently
dispensed
with
it
is
no
psychologic
accident
that
rhyme
came
later
into
english
than
in
french
and
is
leaving
it
sooner
chinese
verse
has
developed
along
very
much
the
same
lines
as
french
verse
the
syllable
is
an
even
more
integral
and
sonorous
unit
than
in
french
while
quantity
and
stress
are
too
uncertain
to
form
the
basis
of
a
metric
system
so
and
so
many
syllables
per
rhythmic
unit
and
rhyme
are
therefore
two
of
the
controlling
factors
in
chinese
prosody
the
third
factor
the
alternation
of
syllables
with
level
tone
and
syllables
with
inflected
rising
or
falling
tone
is
peculiar
to
chinese
footnote
poetry
everywhere
is
inseparable
in
its
origins
from
the
singing
voice
and
the
measure
of
the
dance
yet
accentual
and
syllabic
types
of
verse
rather
than
quantitative
verse
seem
to
be
the
prevailing
norms
footnote
quantitative
distinctions
exist
as
an
objective
fact
they
have
not
the

inner
psychological
value
that
they
had
in

verhaeren
was
no

alexandrine
yet
he
remarked
to
symons
of
the
translation
of
that
while
he
approved
of
the
use
of
rhymeless
verse
in
the
english
version
he
found
it
meaningless
in
french
to
summarize
latin
and
greek
verse
depends
on
the
principle
of
contrasting
weights
english
verse
on
the
principle
of

french

number
and

chinese
verse
on
the
principles
of
number
echo
and
contrasting
pitches
each
of
these
rhythmic
systems
proceeds
from
the
unconscious
dynamic
habit
of
the
language
falling
from
the
lips
of
the
folk
study
carefully
the
phonetic
system
of
a
language
above
all
its
dynamic
features
and
you
can
tell
what
kind
of
a
verse
it
has
developed
or
if
history
has
played
pranks
with
its
phychology
what
kind
of
verse
it
should
have
developed

some
day
will
whatever
be
the

of
a

however
these
lay
hands
on
the
shape
of
its
literature
there
is
a
subtle
law
of
compensations
that
gives
the
artist
space
if
he
is
squeezed
a
bit
here
he
can
swing
a
free
arm
there

generally
he
has
rope
enough

hang
himself
with
if
he
must
it
is
not
strange
that
this
should
be
so
language
is
itself
the
collective
art
of
expression
a
summary
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
individual
intuitions
the
individual
goes
lost
in
the
collective
creation
but
his
personal

has
left
some

in
a
certain

and
flexibility
that
are
inherent

the

made

to
define

individuality
if
no
