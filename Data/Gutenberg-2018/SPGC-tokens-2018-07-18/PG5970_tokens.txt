puffed
her

at

took
on
mighty
few
airs
fer
a
person
in

she
sat
on

miserable

took
pictures
from

walls
and
chairs
from

lovey
mary
chapter
i
a
for
life
with
all
it
yields
of
joy
and
woe
and
hope
and
fear
is
just
our
chance
o
the
prize
of
learning
love
how
love
might
be
hath
been
indeed
and
is
browning
a
death
in
the
desert
everything
about
lovey
mary
was
a
contradiction
from
her
hands
and
feet
which
seemed
to
have
been
meant
for
a
big
girl
to
her
high
ideals
and
aspirations
that
ought
to
have
belonged
to
an
amiable
one
the
only
ingredient
which
might
have
reconciled
all
the
conflicting
elements
in
her
chaotic
little
bosom
was
one
which
no
one
had
ever
taken
the
trouble
to
supply
when
miss
bell
the
matron
of
the
home
came
to
receive
lovey
confession
of
repentance
she
found
her
at
an
window
making
hideous
faces
and
kicking
the
furniture
the
depth
of
her
repentance
could
always
be
gaged
by
the
violence
of
her
conduct
miss
bell
looked
at
her
as
she
would
have
looked
at
one
of
the
hieroglyphs
on
the
obelisk
she
had
been
trying
to
decipher
her
for
thirteen
years
miss
bell
was
stout
and
prim
a
combination
which
was
surely
never
intended
by
nature
her
gray
dress
and
tight
linen
collar
and
cuffs
gave
the
uncomfortable
impression
of
being
sewed
on
while
her
rigid
black
seemed
irrevocably
painted
upon
her
high
forehead
she
was
a
routinist
she
believed
in
system
she
believed
in
order
and
she
believed
that
godliness
was
akin
to
cleanliness
when
she
found
an
exception
to
a
rule
she
regarded
the
exception
in
the
light
of
an
error
as
she
stood
brush
in
hand
before
lovey
mary
she
thought
for
the
hundredth
time
that
the
child
was
an
exception
stand
up
she
said
firmly
but
not
unkindly
i
thought
you
had
too
much
sense
to
do
your
hair
that
way
come
back
to
the
and
i
will
arrange
it
properly
lovey
mary
gave
a
farewell
kick
at
the
wall
before
she
followed
miss
bell
one
side
of
her
head
was
covered
with
tight
black
ringlets
and
the
other
bristled
with
when
i
was
a
little
girl
said
miss
bell
running
the
wet
comb
ruthlessly
through
the
treasured
curls
the
smoother
my
hair
was
the
better
i
liked
it
i
used
to
brush
it
down
with
soap
and
water
to
make
it
stay
lovey
mary
looked
at
the
and
sighed
if
you
ugly
you
never
can
get
married
with
anybody
can
you
miss
bell
she
asked
in
a
spirit
of
earnest
inquiry
miss
bell
back
became
stiffer
if
possible
than
before
marriage
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
the
homelier
you
are
the
better
chance
you
have
of
being
good
now
the
lord
meant
you
to
be
plain
assisting
providence
by
drawing
the
braids
so
tight
that
the
girl
eyebrows
were
elevated
with
the
strain
if
he
had
meant
you
to
have
curls
he
would
have
given
them
to
you
illustration
the
lord
meant
you
to
be
plain
well
did
he
want
me
to
have
a
mother
and
father
burst
forth
lovey
mary
indignantly
or
clothes
or
money
or
nothing
ca
i
ever
get
nothing
at
all
i
was
started
out
with
nothing
miss
bell
was
too
shocked
to
reply
she
gave
a
final
brush
to
the
sleek
wet
head
and
turned
sorrowfully
away
lovey
mary
ran
after
her
and
caught
her
hand
i
sorry
she
cried
impulsively
i
want
to
be
good
please
please
miss
bell
drew
her
hand
away
coldly
you
need
go
to
this
morning
she
said
in
an
injured
tone
you
can
stay
here
and
think
over
what
you
have
said
i
am
not
angry
with
you
i
never
allow
myself
to
get
angry
i
do
understand
that
all
you
are
such
a
good
girl
about
some
things
and
so
unreasonable
about
others
with
a
good
home
good
clothes
and
kind
treatment
what
else
could
a
girl
want
receiving
no
answer
to
this
inquiry
miss
bell
adjusted
her
cuffs
and
departed
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
done
all
that
was
possible
to
throw
light
upon
a
dark
subject
lovey
mary
left
alone
shed
bitter
tears
on
her
clean
gingham
dress
thirteen
years
ought
to
reconcile
a
person
even
to
gingham
dresses
with
white
china
buttons
down
the
back
and
round
straw
hats
bought
at
wholesale
but
lovey
mary
rebellion
of
spirit
was
something
that
time
only
served
to
increase
it
had
started
with
kate
rider
who
used
to
pinch
her
and
laugh
at
her
and
tell
the
other
girls
to
get
on
to
her
curves
curves
had
signified
something
dreadful
to
lovey
mary
she
would
have
experienced
real
relief
could
she
have
known
that
she
did
not
possess
any
it
was
not
kate
rider
however
who
was
causing
the
present
tears
she
had
left
the
home
two
years
before
and
her
name
was
not
allowed
to
be
mentioned
even
in
whispers
neither
was
it
rebellion
against
the
work
that
had
cast
lovey
mary
into
such
depths
of
gloom
fourteen
beds
had
been
made
fourteen
heads
had
been
combed
and
fourteen
wriggling
little
bodies
had
been
cheerfully
buttoned
into
starchy
blue
ginghams
exactly
like
her
own
something
deeper
and
more
mysterious
was
fermenting
in
her
soul
something
that
made
her
long
passionately
for
the
beautiful
things
of
life
for
love
and
sympathy
and
happiness
something
that
made
her
want
to
be
good
yet
tempted
her
constantly
to
rebel
against
her
environs
it
was
just
the
spirit
that
makes
the
veriest
little
weed
struggle
through
a
chink
in
the
rock
and
reach
upward
toward
the
sun
what
the
matter
with
your
hair
lovey
mary
it
looks
so
funny
asked
a
small
girl
coming
up
the
steps
if
anybody
asts
you
tell
you
do
know
snapped
lovey
mary
well
miss
bell
says
for
you
to
come
down
to
the
office
said
the
other
unabashed
there
a
lady
down
there
a
lady
and
a
baby
me
and
susie
peeked
in
miss
bell
made
the
lady
cry
she
made
her
wipe
the
powders
off
her
compleshun
and
she
sent
for
me
asked
lovey
mary
incredulously
such
a
ripple
in
the
still
waters
of
the
home
was
sufficient
to
interest
the
most
disconsolate
yes
and
me
and
susie
going
to
peek
some
more
lovey
mary
dried
her
tears
and
hurried
down
to
the
office
as
she
stood
at
the
door
she
heard
a
girl
excited
voice
protesting
and
begging
and
miss
bell
placid
tones
attempting
to
calm
her
they
paused
as
she
entered
mary
said
miss
bell
you
remember
kate
rider
she
has
brought
her
child
for
us
to
take
care
of
for
a
while
have
you
room
for
him
in
your
division
as
lovey
mary
looked
at
the
gaily
dressed
girl
on
the
sofa
her
animosity
rekindled
it
was
not
kate
bold
black
eyes
that
stirred
her
wrath
nor
the
hard
red
lips
that
recalled
the
taunts
of
other
days
it
was
the
sight
of
the
auburn
curls
gathered
in
tantalizing
profusion
under
the
brim
of
the
showy
hat
mary
answer
my
question
said
miss
bell
sharply
with
an
involuntary
shudder
of
repugnance
lovey
mary
drew
her
gaze
from
kate
and
murmured
yes
then
you
can
take
the
baby
with
you
continued
miss
bell
motioning
to
the
sleeping
child
but
wait
a
moment
i
think
i
will
put
jennie
at
the
head
of
your
division
and
let
you
have
entire
charge
of
this
little
boy
he
is
only
a
year
old
kate
tells
me
so
will
need
constant
attention
lovey
mary
was
about
to
protest
when
kate
broke
in
oh
say
miss
bell
please
get
some
other
girl
tommy
never
would
like
lovey
he
just
like
me
if
people
ai
pretty
he
do
have
no
use
for
that
will
do
kate
said
miss
bell
coldly
it
is
only
pity
for
the
child
that
makes
me
take
him
at
all
you
have
forfeited
all
claim
upon
our
sympathy
or
patience
mary
take
the
baby
and
care
for
him
until
i
come
lovey
mary
hot
with
rebellion
picked
him
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
at
the
door
she
stumbled
against
two
little
girls
who
were
listening
at
the
keyhole
in
the
long
dormitory
it
was
very
quiet
the
children
had
been
marched
away
to
and
only
lovey
mary
and
the
sleeping
baby
were
on
the
second
floor
the
girl
sat
beside
the
little
white
bed
and
hated
the
world
as
far
as
she
knew
it
she
hated
kate
for
adding
this
last
insult
to
the
old
score
she
hated
miss
bell
for
putting
this
new
burden
on
her
unwilling
shoulders
she
hated
the
burden
itself
lying
there
before
her
so
serene
and
unconcerned
and
most
of
all
she
hated
herself
i
wisht
i
was
dead
she
cried
passionately
the
harder
i
try
to
be
good
the
meaner
i
get
blames
me
and
makes
fun
of
me
ugly
old
face
and
ugly
old
hands
and
straight
old
hair
it
ai
no
wonder
that
nobody
loves
me
i
just
wisht
i
was
dead
the
sunshine
came
through
the
window
and
made
a
big
white
patch
on
the
bare
floor
but
lovey
mary
sat
in
the
shadow
and
disturbed
the
sunday
quiet
by
her
heavy
sobbing
at
noon
when
the
children
returned
the
noise
of
their
arrival
woke
tommy
he
opened
his
round
eyes
on
a
strange
world
and
began
to
cry
lustily
one
child
after
another
tried
to
pacify
him
but
each
friendly
advance
increased
his
terror
leave
him
be
cried
lovey
mary
them
hats
is
enough
to
skeer
him
into
fits
she
picked
him
up
and
with
the
knack
born
of
experience
soothed
and
comforted
him
the
baby
hid
his
face
on
her
shoulder
and
held
her
tight
she
could
feel
the
sobs
that
still
shook
the
small
body
and
his
tears
were
on
her
cheek
never
mind
she
said
i
ai
to
let
hurt
you
going
to
take
care
of
you
do
cry
any
more
look
she
stretched
forth
her
long
unshapely
hand
and
made
grotesque
snatches
at
the
sunshine
that
poured
in
through
the
window
tommy
hesitated
and
was
lost
a
smile
struggled
to
the
surface
then
broke
through
the
tears
look
he
laughing
cried
lovey
mary
gleefully
he
laughing
i
ketched
a
sunbeam
for
him
then
she
bent
impulsively
and
kissed
the
little
red
lips
so
close
to
her
own
chapter
ii
a
runaway
couple
courage
mounteth
with
occasion
for
two
years
lovey
mary
cared
for
tommy
she
bathed
him
and
dressed
him
taught
him
to
walk
and
kissed
his
bumps
to
make
them
well
she
sewed
for
him
and
nursed
him
by
day
and
slept
with
him
in
her
tired
arms
at
night
and
tommy
with
the
inscrutable
philosophy
of
childhood
accepted
his
little
and
gave
her
his
all
one
bright
june
afternoon
the
two
were
romping
in
the
home
yard
under
the
lovey
mary
lay
in
the
grass
while
tommy
threw
handfuls
of
leaves
in
her
face
laughing
with
delight
at
her
grimaces
presently
the
gate
clicked
and
some
one
came
toward
them
good
land
is
that
my
kid
said
a
woman
voice
come
here
tom
and
kiss
your
mother
lovey
mary
sitting
up
found
kate
rider
in
frills
and
ribbons
looking
with
surprise
at
the
sturdy
child
before
her
tommy
objected
violently
to
this
sudden
overture
and
declined
positively
to
acknowledge
the
relationship
in
fact
when
kate
attempted
to
pull
him
to
her
he
fled
for
protection
to
lovey
mary
and
cast
belligerent
glances
at
the
intruder
kate
laughed
oh
you
need
be
so
scary
you
might
as
well
get
used
to
me
for
i
am
going
to
take
you
home
with
me
i
bet
he
a
corker
ai
he
lovey
he
used
to
bawl
all
night
sometimes
i
have
to
spank
him
two
or
three
times
lovey
mary
clasped
the
child
closer
and
looked
up
in
dumb
terror
was
tommy
to
be
taken
from
her
tommy
to
go
away
with
kate
great
scott
exclaimed
kate
exasperated
at
the
girl
manner
you
are
just
as
ugly
and
foolish
as
you
used
to
be
i
going
in
to
see
miss
bell
lovey
mary
waited
until
she
was
in
the
house
then
she
stole
noiselessly
around
to
the
office
window
the
curtain
blew
out
across
her
cheek
and
the
swaying
lilacs
seemed
to
be
trying
to
count
the
china
buttons
on
her
back
but
she
stood
there
with
staring
eyes
and
parted
lips
and
held
her
breath
to
listen
illustration
with
caption
here
tom
and
kiss
your
mother
of
course
miss
bell
was
saying
measuring
her
words
with
due
precision
if
you
feel
that
you
can
now
support
your
child
and
that
it
is
your
duty
to
take
him
we
can
not
object
there
are
many
other
children
waiting
to
come
into
the
home
and
yet
miss
bell
voice
sounded
human
and
unnatural
yet
i
wish
he
could
stay
have
you
thought
kate
of
your
responsibility
toward
him
of
oh
ough
shrieked
tommy
from
the
playground
in
tones
of
distress
lovey
mary
left
her
point
of
vantage
and
rushed
to
the
rescue
she
found
him
emitting
frenzied
yells
while
a
tiny
stream
of
blood
trickled
down
his
chin
it
was
my
little
duck
he
gasped
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
speak
i
was
tissin
him
an
he
bited
me
at
thought
of
the
base
ingratitude
on
the
part
of
the
duck
tommy
wailed
anew
lovey
mary
led
him
to
the
hydrant
and
bathed
the
injured
lip
while
she
soothed
his
feelings
suddenly
a
wave
of
tenderness
swept
over
her
she
held
his
chubby
face
up
to
hers
and
said
fervently
tommy
do
you
love
me
yes
said
tommy
with
a
reproachful
eye
on
the
duck
yes
i
yuv
to
yuv
i
do
yuv
to
tiss
though
but
me
tommy
me

he
answered
gravely
dollar
an
a
half
whose
little
boy
are
you
yuvey
boy
satisfied
with
this
catechism
she
put
tommy
in
care
of
another
girl
and
went
back
to
her
post
at
the
window
miss
bell
was
talking
again
i
will
have
him
ready
afternoon
when
you
come
his
clothes

all
in

condition
i
only
hope
kate
that
you

as
tenderly
as

i
am
afraid
he
will
miss
her
sadly
if
he

two
or
three
days
answered
the
other
voice
it
always
was
of
sight
out
of
with
me
miss
bell
answer
was
indistinct
and
in
a
few
minutes
lovey
mary
heard
the
hall
door
close
behind
them
she
shook
her
fists
until
the
lilacs
trembled
she
have
him
she
whispered
fiercely
she
let
him
grow
up
wicked
like
she
is
i
wo
let
him
go
hide
him
i
suddenly
she
grew
very
still
and
for
a
long
time
crouched
motionless
behind
the
bushes
the
problem
that
faced
her
had
but
one
solution
and
lovey
mary
had
found
it
the
next
morning
when
the
sun
climbed
over
the
and
peered
into
the
dormitory
windows
he
found
that
somebody
else
had
made
an
early
rise
lovey
mary
was
sitting
by
a
wardrobe
making
her
last
will
and
testament
from
the
neatly
folded
pile
of
linen
she
selected
a
few
garments
and
tied
them
into
a
bundle
then
she
took
out
a
and
gravely
contemplated
the
contents
there
were
two
narrow
ribbons
which
had
evidently
been
one
wide
ribbon
a
bit
of
rock
crystal
four
paper
dolls
a
soiled
with
some
other
little
girl
name
scratched
out
on
the
cover
and
two
shining
silver
dollars
these
composed
lovey
mary
worldly
possessions
she
tied
the
money
in
her
handkerchief
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
then
got
up
softly
and
slipped
about
among
the
little
white
beds
distributing
her
treasures
i
mad
at
susie
she
whispered
pausing
before
a
tousled
head
i
hate
to
give
her
the
nicest
thing
i
got
but
she
just
crazy
the
curious
sun
climbed
yet
a
little
higher
and
saw
lovey
mary
go
back
to
her
own
bed
and
rolling
tommy
clothes
around
her
own
bundle
gather
the
sleeping
child
in
her
arms
and
steal
quietly
out
of
the
room
then
the
sun
got
too
high
up
in
the
heavens
to
watch
little
runaway
orphan
girls
nobody
saw
her
steal
through
the
deserted
playroom
down
the
clean
bare
steps
which
she
had
helped
to
wear
away
and
out
through
the
yard
to
the
here
she
got
the
reluctant
tommy
into
his
clothes
and
tied
on
his
little
round
straw
hat
so
absurdly
like
her
own
is
we
playin
yuvey
asked
the
mystified
youngster
yes
tommy
she
whispered
and
we
are
going
a
long
way
to
hide
you
are
my
little
boy
now
and
you
must
love
me
better
than
anything
in
the
world
say
it
tommy
say
love
you
better
anybody
in
the
whole
world
will
i
det
on
de
rollin
honor
asked
tommy
thinking
he
was
learning
his
golden
text
but
lovey
mary
had
forgotten
her
question
she
was
taking
a
farewell
look
at
the
home
every
nook
and
corner
of
which
had
suddenly
grown
dear
already
she
seemed
a
thing
apart
one
having
no
right
to
its
shelter
and
protection
she
turned
to
where
tommy
was
playing
with
some
sticks
in
the
corner
and
bidding
him
not
to
stir
or
speak
until
her
return
she
slipped
back
up
the
walk
and
into
the
kitchen
swiftly
and
quietly
she
made
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
filled
the
kettle
with
water
then
she
looked
about
for
something
more
she
might
do
on
the
table
lay
the
grocery
book
with
a
pencil
attached
she
thought
a
moment
then
wrote
laboriously
under
the
last
order
miss
bell
i
will
take
kere
tommy
pleas
do
be
mad
then
she
softly
closed
the
door
behind
her
a
few
minutes
later
she
lifted
tommy
out
of
the
low
shed
window
and
hurried
him
down
the
alley
and
out
into
the
early
morning
streets
at
the
corner
they
took
a
car
and
tommy
knelt
by
the
window
and
absorbed
the
sights
with
rapt
attention
to
him
the
adventure
was
beginning
brilliantly
even
lovey
mary
experienced
a
sense
of
exhilaration
when
she
paid
their
fare
out
of
one
of
the
silver
dollars
she
knew
the
conductor
was
impressed
because
he
said
you
better
watch
hat
that
pleased
her
profoundly
it
caused
her
unconsciously
to
assume
miss
bell
tone
and
manner
as
she
conversed
with
the
back
of
tommy
head
we
go
out
on
the
avenue
she
said
we
go
from
house
to
house
till
i
get
work
anybody
would
be
glad
to
get
a
handy
girl
that
can
cook
and
wash
and
sew
only
i
ai
very
big
and
then
you
ai
that
a
big
house
shouted
tommy
half
way
out
of
the
window
yes
do
talk
so
loud
that
the
where
they
make
at
inquired
tommy
shrilly
lovey
mary
glanced
around
uneasily
she
hoped
the
old
man
in
the
corner
had
not
heard
this
benighted
remark
all
went
well
until
the
car
reached
the
terminal
station
here
tommy
refused
to
get
off
in
vain
lovey
mary
coaxed
and
threatened
it
take
us
right
back
to
the
home
she
pleaded
be
a
good
boy
and
come
with
lovey
i
buy
you
something
nice
tommy
remained
obdurate
he
believed
in
letting
well
enough
alone
the
joys
of
a
ride
were
present
and
tangible
something
nice
was
vague
unsatisfying
do
yer
little
brother
want
to
git
off
asked
the
conductor
sympathetically
no
sir
said
lovey
mary
trying
to
maintain
her
dignity
while
she
struggled
with
her
charge
if
you
please
sir
would
you
mind
holding
his
feet
while
i
loosen
his
hands
tommy
shrieking
indignant
protests
was
borne
from
the
car
and
deposited
on
the
sidewalk
do
you
dare
get
limber
threatened
lovey
mary
if
you
do
spank
you
right
here
on
the
street
stand
up
straighten
out
your
legs
tommy
do
you
hear
me
tommy
might
have
remained
limp
indefinitely
had
not
a
opportunely
arrived
on
the
scene
it
is
true
that
he
would
go
only
in
the
direction
of
the
music
but
lovey
mary
was
delighted
to
have
him
go
at
all
when
at
last
they
were
headed
for
the
avenue
tommy
caused
another
delay
i
want
my
ducky
he
announced
the
words
brought
consternation
to
lovey
mary
she
had
fearfully
anticipated
them
from
the
moment
of
leaving
the
home
i
buy
you
a
duck
she
said
no
i
want
a
ducky
i
want
mine
lovey
mary
was
exasperated
well
you
ca
have
yours
i
ca
get
it
for
you
and
you
might
as
well
hush
his
lips
trembled
and
two
large
tears
rolled
down
his
round
cheeks
when
he
was
injured
he
was
irresistible
lovey
mary
promptly
surrendered
do
cry
baby
boy
lovey
get
you
one
someway
for
some
time
the
quest
of
the
duck
was
fruitless
the
stores
they
entered
were
wholesale
houses
for
the
most
part
where
men
were
rolling
barrels
about
or
stacking
skins
and
hides
on
the
sidewalk
do
you
know
what
sort
of
a
store
they
sell
ducks
at
asked
lovey
mary
of
a
colored
man
who
was
sweeping
out
an
office
ducks
repeated
the
negro
grinning
at
the
queerly
dressed
children
in
their
round
straw
hats
name
o
de
lawd
what
do
you
all
want
wif
ducks
lovey
mary
explained
would
a
kitten
do
jes
as
well
he
asked
kindly
i
want
my
ducky
whined
tommy
showing
signs
of
returning
storm
i
don
see
no
way
gwine
to
de
mahket
efen
you
tek
de
cah
you
kin
ride
plumb
down
dere
recent
experience
had
taught
lovey
mary
to
be
wary
of
so
they
walked
at
the
market
they
found
some
ducks
the
desired
objects
were
hanging
in
a
bunch
with
their
limp
heads
tied
together
further
inquiry
however
discovered
some
live
ones
in
a
coop
they
all
mama
ducks
objected
tommy
i
want
a
baby
ducky
i
want
my
little
ducky
when
he
found
he
could
do
no
better
he
decided
to
take
one
of
the
large
ones
then
he
said
he
was
hungry
so
he
and
mary
took
turn
about
holding
it
while
the
other
ate
po
man
pickle
and
wienerwurst
it
was
two
by
the
time
they
reached
the
avenue
and
by
four
they
were
and
weary
but
they
trudged
bravely
along
from
house
to
house
asking
for
work
as
dusk
came
on
the
houses
which
a
few
squares
back
had
been
tall
and
imposing
seemed
to
be
getting
smaller
and
more
insignificant
lovey
mary
felt
secure
as
long
as
she
was
on
the
avenue
she
did
not
know
that
the
avenue
extended
for
many
miles
and
that
she
had
reached
the
frayed
and
ragged
end
of
it
she
and
tommy
passed
under
a
bridge
and
after
that
the
houses
all
seemed
to
behave
queerly
some
faced
one
way
some
another
and
crisscross
between
them
in
front
of
them
and
behind
them
ran
a
network
of
railroad
tracks
what
the
name
of
this
street
asked
lovey
mary
of
a
small
footed
girl
ai
no
street
answered
the
little
girl
gazing
with
undisguised
amazement
at
the
couple
this
here
is
the
cabbage
patch
illustration
ai
no
street
this

chapter
iii
the
hazy
household
here
sovereign
dirt
erects
her
sable
throne
the
house
the
host
the
hostess
all
her
own
miss
hazy
was
the
submerged
tenth
of
the
cabbage
patch
the
submersion
was
mainly
one
of
dirt
and
disorder
but
miss
hazy
was
such
a
meek
inefficient
little
body
that
the
cabbage
patch
withheld
its
blame
and
patiently
tried
to
furnish
a
prop
for
the
clinging
vine
miss
hazy
it
is
true
had
chris
but
chris
was
unstable
not
only
because
he
had
lost
one
leg
but
also
because
he
was
the
wildest
noisiest
most
thoughtless
youngster
that
ever
shied
a
rock
at
a
miss
hazy
had
raised
chris
and
the
neighbors
had
raised
miss
hazy
when
lovey
mary
stumbled
over
the
hazy
threshold
with
the
sleeping
tommy
and
the
duck
in
her
arms
miss
hazy
fluttered
about
in
dismay
she
pushed
the
farther
over
on
the
bed
and
made
a
place
for
tommy
then
she
got
a
chair
for
the
exhausted
girl
and
hovered
about
her
with
little
chirps
of
consternation

her
was
a
little
woman
whose
smile
seemed
to
thaw
out
the
frozen
places
in
lovey
mary
heart
and
make
her
burst
into
tears
on
the
motherly
bosom
there
now

the

off
a
broken
plate
then
climbed
over
behind
tommy
and
the
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
the
business
meeting
next
morning
to
think
things
out
resulted
satisfactorily
at
first
wiggs
was
inclined
to
ask
questions
and
find
out
where
the
children
came
from
but
when
she
saw
lovey
evident
distress
and
embarrassment
she
accepted
the
statement
that
they
were
orphans
and
that
the
girl
was
seeking
work
in
order
to
take
care
of
herself
and
the
boy
it
had
come
to
be
an
unwritten
law
in
the
cabbage
patch
that
as
few
questions
as
possible
should
be
asked
of
strangers
people
had
come
there
before
who
could
not
give
clear
accounts
of
themselves
now

you

along
right
peart
lovey
mary
stayed
in
the
house
most
of
the
day
she
was
almost
afraid
to
look
out
of
the
little
window
for
fear
she
should
see
miss
bell
or
kate
rider
coming
she
sat
in
the
only
chair
that
had
a
bottom
and
diligently
worked
buttonholes
for
miss
hazy
looks
like
there
ai
never
no
time
to
clean
up
said
miss
hazy
apologetically
as
she
shoved
chris
sunday
clothes
and
a
can
of
behind
the
door
lovey
mary
looked
about
her
and
sighed
deeply
the
room
was
brimful
and
spilling
over
trash
tin
cans
and
bottles
overflowed
the
sills
a
crippled
with
a
faded
quilt
over
it
stood
before
the
stove
in
the
open
oven
of
which
chris
shoe
was
drying
an
old
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
miss
hazy
sewing
on
one
end
of
it
and
the
uncleared
on
the
other
mary
could
not
see
under
the
bed
but
she
knew
from
the
experience
that
it
was
used
as
a
combination
and
wardrobe
she
thought
of
the
home
with
its
bare
clean
rooms
and
its
spotless
floors
she
rose
abruptly
and
went
out
to
the
rear
of
the
house
where
tommy
was
playing
with
europena
wiggs
they
were
absorbed
in
trying
to
hitch
the
duck
to
a
and
paid
little
attention
to
her
tommy
she
said
clutching
his
arm
do
you
want
to
go
back
but
tommy
had
tasted
freedom
he
had
had
one
blissful
day
unwashed
uncombed
and
uncorrected
no
he
declared
stoutly
i
doin
to
stay
to
this
house
and
play
wiv
then
said
mary
with
deep
resignation
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
try
to
clean
things
up
when
she
went
back
into
the
house
she
untied
her
bundle
and
took
out
the
remaining
dollar
i
be
back
soon
she
said
to
miss
hazy
as
she
stepped
over
a
basket
of
potatoes
i
just
going
over
to
wiggs
a
minute
she
found
her
neighbor
alone

her
subject

once

girls

disconsolately
i
so

wiggs
shook
her
by
the
shoulders
now
here

said

mary
laughed
and
wiggs
clapped
her
hands
that
what
yer
face
needs
smiles
i
never
see
anything
make
such
a
difference

with
the
intoxication
of

tried
on
the
dress

interested
that
she
forgot

said
miss
hazy
it
keeps
you
from
lookin
so
corpsey
i
wisht
you
do
somethin
with
yer
hair
though
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
snakes
in
them
long
black
plaits
all
lovey
mary
needed
was
encouragement
she
puffed
her
hair
at
the
top
and
sides
and
tucked
it
up
in
the
latest
fashion
tommy
coming
in
at
the
door
did
not
recognize
her
she
laughed
delightedly
do
i
look
so
different
i
should
say
you
do
said
miss
hazy
admiringly
as
she
spread
a
newspaper
for
a
i
never
seen
no
one
answer
to
like
you
do
illustration
she
puffed
her
hair
at
the
top
and
sides
when
it
was
quite
dark
lovey
mary
rolled
something
in
a
bundle
and
crept
out
of
the
house
after
glancing
cautiously
up
and
down
the
tracks
she
made
her
way
to
the
pond
on
the
commons
and
dropped
her
bundle
into
the
shallow
water
next
day
when
schultz
goat
died
of
convulsions
nobody
knew
it
was
due
to
the
china
buttons
on
lovey
mary
gingham
dress
chapter
iv
an
accident
and
an
incident
our
deeds
still
travel
with
us
from
afar
and
what
we
have
been
makes
us
what
we
are
through
the
assistance
of
asia
wiggs
lovey
mary
secured
pleasant
and
profitable
work
at
the
factory
but
her
mind
was
not
at
peace
of
course
it
was
a
joy
to
wear
the
red
dress
and
arrange
her
hair
a
different
way
each
morning
but
there
was
a
queer
restless
little
feeling
in
her
heart
that
spoiled
even
the
satisfaction
of
looking
like
other
girls
and
earning
three
dollars
a
week
the
very
fact
that
nobody
took
her
to
task
that
nobody
scolded
or
blamed
her
caused
her
to
ask
herself
disturbing
questions
secret
perplexity
had
the
same
effect
upon
her
that
it
has
upon
many
who
are
older
and
wiser
it
made
her
cross
two
days
after
she
started
to
work
asia
coming
down
from
the
for
lunch
found
her
in
fiery
dispute
with
a
haired
girl
there
had
been
an
accident
in
front
of
the
factory
and
the
details
were
under
discussion

looking
worried
and
preoccupied
how

duets
round

lovey
mary
smiled
faintly
for
a
month
past
she
had
been
unconsciously
striving
to
live
up
to
wiggs
opinion
of
her
and
the
constant
praise
and
commendation
of
that
courageous
captain
of
compliment
had
moved
her
to
herculean
effort
but
a
sudden
catastrophe
threatened
her
she
sat
on
the
white
and
miserable
held
tight
in
the
hand
that
was
thrust
in
her
pocket
was
a
letter
it
was
a
blue
letter
addressed
to
miss
hazy
in
large
dashing
characters
lovey
mary
had
got
it
from
the
postman
as
she
went
out
in
the
morning
for
five
hours
she
had
been
racked
with
doubt
concerning
it
she
felt
that
it
could
refer
but
to
one
subject
and
that
was
herself
perhaps
miss
bell
had
discovered
her
place
or
worse
still
perhaps
kate
rider
had
seen
her
at
the
factory
and
was
writing
for
tommy
lovey
mary
crushed
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
would
not
give
it
to
miss
hazy
she
would
outwit
kate
again
all
right

of
a

but

up
the
gaps

an
miss
hazy
jes
been
you
lovey
mary
glanced
up
furtively
could
they
have
suspected

she
sat
on
the
white
and
miserable
did
yer
years
sorter
burn
we
was
speakin
of
the
way
slicked
things
up
round
here
i
was
even
if
you

to

crumpled

she
said
despondently
oh

is
said
miss
hazy
with
unusual
animation
she
a
rale
good
girl
when
she
ai
sassy
this
unexpected
praise
was
too
much
for
lovey
mary
she
snatched
the
letter
from
her
pocket
and
threw
it
on
the
table
not
daring
to
trust
her
good
impulse
to
last
beyond
the
minute

teeth
and

lovey
mary
sat
before
her
untasted
food
she
could
hear
tommy
laughter
through
the
open
window
and
the
sound
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
but
voice
recalled
her
and
she
nerved
herself
for
the
worst
miss
dear

from
the
large
sheet
before

astrologer
as
the
reading
proceeded
lovey
mary
fears
gradually
diminished
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
applied
herself
to
her
lunch
but
if
the
letter
had
proved
of
no
consequence
to
her
such
was
not
the
case
with
the
two
women
standing
at
the
window
miss
hazy
was
the
letter
vainly
trying
to
master
the
contents
mary
she
said
git
up
an
see
if
you
can
find
my
other
pair
of
seems
like
i
ca
git
the
sense
of
it

meanwhile

excitedly
commenting
on
the
charms
of
the
spirit
picture
my
but
he
siylish
looks
fer
all
the
world
like
a
insurance
agent
looks
like
he
might
be
a
little
tall
to
his
size
but
i
like
statute
men
better
dumpy
ones
i
bet
he
got
a
lot
of
nice
manners
ai
his
smile
pleasant
miss
hazy
seized
the
small
picture
with
trembling
fingers
i
seem
to
git
on
to
what
it
all
about
mis
wiggs
ai
they
made
a
mistake
or
somethin
no
indeed
there
no
mistake
at
all
declared
wiggs
yer
name
on
the
back
an
it
meant
fer
you
someway
yer
name
got
out
as
bein
single
an
needin
takin
keer
of
an
i
reckon
this
here
or
conjurer
or
whatever
he
is
seen

good
fortune
in
the

an
jes
wanted
to
let
you

he
want
to
get

with

asked
lovey
mary
beginning
to
realize
the
grave
importance
of
the
subject
under
discussion
well
it
may
lead
to
that
answered
wiggs
hopefully
surely
only
a
beneficent
providence
could
have
offered
such
an
unexpected
solution
to
the
problem
of
miss
hazy
future
miss
hazy
herself
uttered
faint
protests
and
expostulations
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
becoming
influenced
by
enthusiasm
oh
shoo
she
repeated
again
and
again
i
ai
never
had
no
thought
of
marryin
course
you
ai
said
wiggs
good
enough
reason
you
had
a
show
before
seems
to
me
you
be
flyin
straight
in
the
face
of
providence
to
refuse
a
stylish
man
like
that
he
is
acknowledged
miss
hazy
trying
not
to
appear
too
pleased
only
i
wisht
his
years
did
stick
out
so
much
wiggs
was
exasperated
lawsee
miss
hazy
what
do
you
think
he
think
of

so
much
to
brag
on
that

dared
to
judge
wiggs
that
away
why
wiggs
nose
was
as
long
as
a
clothespin
but
i
would
no
more
thought
of

thought
of
him
without
the
nose
well
what
do

it
asked
miss
hazy
i
ai
quite
made
up
my

neighbors
but
i
if

up
a
quarter
that
you

the
mornin
mail
that
night
lovey
mary
sat
in
her
little
attic
room
and
held
tommy
close
to
her
hungry
heart
all
day
she
worked
with
the
thought
of
coming
back
to
him
at
night
but
with
night
came
the
dustman
and
in
spite
of
her
games
and
stories
tommy
blue
eyes
would
get
full
of
the
tonight
however
he
was
awake
and
talkative
ai
i
dot
no
muvver
he
asked
no
said
lovey
mary
after
a
pause
did
i
never
had
no
muvver
lovey
mary
sat
him
up
in
her
lap
and
looked
into
his
round
inquiring
eyes
her
very
love
for
him
hardened
her
heart
against
the
one
who
had
wronged
him
yes

had
a
mother
once
but
she
was
a
bad
mother
a
mean
bad
wicked
mother

broke
in
a
sob
ma

up
the
stairs
you

to
come
down
here
to

to

with
all
his
clothes
on
my
bed
an
i

under
the
cover
and
went
to
miss
assistance
one
night
i

all
night
he
would
git

complained
miss
hazy
in
hopelessly
injured
tones
lovey
mary
wasted
no
time
in
idle
coaxing
she
seized
a
broom
and
rapped
the
sleeper
sharply
on
the
legs
his
was
insensible
to
this
insult
but
one
leg
kicked
a
feeble
protest
in
vain
lovey
mary
tried
violent
measures
chris
simply
shifted
his
position
and
slumbered
on
finally
she
resorted
to
strategy
listen
miss
hazy
ai
that
the
in
a
moment
chris
was
hanging
half
out
of
the
window
demanding
where
at
you
great
big
lazy
boy
scolded
lovey
mary
as
she
put
miss
bed
in
order
i
get
you
to
behaving
mighty
different
if
i
stay
here
long
enough
what
this
she
added
pulling
something
from
under
miss
hazy
pillow
oh
it
ai
nothin
cried
miss
hazy
reaching
for
it
eagerly

lovey

in

believing

the
affair
proved
the

the
hour

husband
was
the
cynosure
of

for
one
brief
week
the
honeymoon
shed
its

on

then
it

and

eclipse
the
groom
got
drunk
mary
was
clearing
away
the
when
she
was
startled
by
a
cry
from
miss
hazy
my
sakes
lovey
mary
look
at
stubbins
up
the
street
do
you
he
had
a
stroke
lovey
mary
ran
to
the
window
and
beheld
the
prominent
citizen
of
bagdad
junction
in
a
state
of
unmistakable
intoxication
he
was
bareheaded
and
hilarious
and
used
the
fence
as
a
miss
hazy
wrung
her
hands
and
wept
oh
what
i
do
she
wailed
i
do
he
had
somethin
to
drink
i
ai
goin
to
stay
an
meet

my
room
and
lock
the
door
i
going
to
stay
here
and
keep
him
from
messing

kitchen
i

i
just
hate
that
man
i
believe

miss

miss

wept
afresh
well
he
ai
my

but
it
like
ever
woman
sorter
wants

try
gittin
married
oncet
anyways
i
never
would
done
it
though
if
wiggs
had
sicked
me
on
by
this
time
stubbins
had
reached
the
yard
and
miss
hazy
fled
lovey
mary
barricaded
tommy
in
a
corner
with
his
playthings
and
met
the
delinquent
at
the
door
her
eyes
blazed
and
her
cheeks
were
aflame
this
modern
david
had
no
stones
and
sling
to
slay
her
goliath
she
had
only
a
vocabulary
full
of
stinging
words
which
she
hurled
forth
with
indignation
and
scorn
stubbins
had
evidently
been
abused
before
for
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
girl
wrath
he
passed
jauntily
to
the
stove
and
tried
to
pour
a
cup
of
coffee
the
hot
liquid
missed
the
cup
and
streamed
over
his
wrist
and
hand
howling
with
pain
and
swearing
vociferously
he
flung
the
out
of
the
window
kicked
a
chair
across
the
room
then
turned
upon
tommy
who
was
adding
shrieks
of
terror
to
the
general
uproar
stop
that
infernal
yelling
he
cried
savagely
as
he
struck
the
child
full
in
the
face
with
his
heavy
hand
lovey
mary
sprang
forward
and
seized
the
poker
all
the
passion
of
her
wild
little
nature
was
roused
she
stole
up
behind
him
as
he
knelt
before
tommy
and
lifted
the
poker
to
strike
a
pair
of
terrified
blue
eyes
arrested
her
tommy
forgot
to
cry
in
sheer
amazement
at
what
she
was
about
to
do
ashamed
of
herself
she
threw
the
poker
aside
and
taking
advantage
of
stubbins
crouching
position
she
thrust
him
suddenly
backward
into
the
closet
the
manoeuver
was
a
brilliant
one
for
while
stubbins
was
unsteadily
separating
himself
from
the
debris
into
which
he
had
been
cast
lovey
mary
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
then
she
picked
up
tommy
and
fled
out
of
the
house
and
across
the
yard
wiggs
was
sitting
on
her
back
porch
pretending
to
knit
but
in
truth
absorbed
in
a
wild
game
of
tag
which
the
children
were
having
on
the
commons
that
right
she
was
calling
excitedly
that
right
chris
hazy
you

ketch
as
good
as
any
of
even

got

but
when
she
caught
sight
of
mary
white
distressed
face
and
tommy
streaming
eyes
she
dropped
her
work
and
held
out
her
arms
when
mary
had
finished

story

inspiration
i

out
to
the
railroad
wiggs
voice
had
sunk
to
a
hoarse
whisper
and
her
eyes
looked
fierce
in
the
twilight
lovey
mary
shuddered

empty

the

far
away
from

asked
mary
giggling
in
nervous
excitement
miss
hazy
ai
got
a
thing
to
do
with
it
replied
wiggs
conclusively
at
midnight
by
the
dark
of
the
moon
the
unconscious
groom
was
borne
out
of
the
hazy
cottage
wiggs
carried
his
head
while
billy
wiggs
and
mary
and
asia
and
chris
officiated
at
his
arms
and
legs
the
bride
surveyed
the
scene
from
the
chinks
of
the
upstairs
shutters
silently
the
little
group
waited
until
the
lumbering
freight
train
slowed
up
to
take
water
then
with
a
concerted
effort
they
lifted
the
heavy
burden
into
an
empty
car
as
they
shrank
back
into
the
shadow
billy
whispered
to
lovey
mary
say
what
was
that
you
put
of
him
mary
looked
shamefaced
it
was
just
a
little
she
said
apologetically
it
seemed
sorter
mean
to
send
him
off
without
anything
to
eat
gee
said
billy
you
a
girl
the
engine
whistled
and
the
train
moved
thunderously
away
bearing
an
unconscious
passenger
who
as
far
as
the
cabbage
patch
was
concerned
was
henceforth
submerged
in
the
darkness
of
oblivion
chapter
vii
neighborly
advice
it
a
poor
business
looking
at
the
sun
with
a
cloudy
face
the
long
hot
summer
days
that
followed
were
full
of
trials
for
lovey
mary
day
after
day
the
great
unwinking
sun
glared
savagely
down
upon
the
cabbage
patch
upon
the
stagnant
pond
upon
the
gleaming
rails
upon
the
puffing
trains
that
pounded
by
hour
after
hour
each
morning
found
lovey
mary
trudging
away
to
the
factory
where
she
stood
all
day
counting
and
sorting
and
packing
tiles
at
night
she
climbed
wearily
to
her
little
room
under
the
roof
and
tried
to
sleep
with
a
wet
cloth
over
her
face
to
keep
her
from
smelling
the
stifling
car
smoke
but
it
was
not
the
heat
and
discomfort
alone
that
made
her
cheeks
thin
and
her
eyes
sad
and
listless
it
was
the
burden
on
her
conscience
which
seemed
to
be
growing
heavier
all
the
time
one
morning
wiggs
took
her
to
task
for
her
gloomy
countenance
they
met
at
the
pump
and
while
the
former
bucket
was
being
filled
lovey
mary
leaned
against
a
and
waited
in
a
dejected
attitude
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
wiggs
what
you
lookin
so
wilted
about
lovey
mary
dug
her
shoe
into
the
ground
and
said
nothing
many
a
time
had
she
been
tempted
to
pour
forth
her
story
to
this
friendly
mentor
but
the
fear
of
discovery
and
her
hatred
of
kate
deterred
her
wiggs
eyed
her
keenly
pesterin
about
somethin
she
asked
yes
said
lovey
mary
in
a
low
tone
somethin
that
already
did
yes
still
lower
did
you
think
you
was
actin
fer
the
best
the
girl
lifted
a

wiggs
heartily
you

exactly
what

her
agreed
wiggs
it

miss
hazy
to
my
way
of
thinkin
nerves
is
worser
than

an
cancers
look
at
old
schultz
she
got
the
dropsy
so
bad
you

as
good
a
time
as

ca
let
lovey

go
on
with
these
here
nerves
no
tellin
where
they
land
her
at
if

jes
springtime

her
sulphur
an
molasses
an
jes
a
leetle
cream
of
tartar
that
used
along
with
tea

the
outbeatenest
tonic
i

but
i
never
would
run
the
seasons
seems
to
me
i
heared
yallerroot
spoke
of
fer
nerves
i
do
we
could
git
no
yallerroot
round

dog
back
let

lovey

out
there
to
git
some
an
we
jes
repeat
the
dose
on
her
till

takes
some
hold
i
ai
puttin
much
stock
in
miss
viny
demurred
miss
hazy
heared
she
was
a
novelist
reader
an
she
ai
even
a
an
do

set
up
to
jedge
her
asked
wiggs
in
fine
scorn
miss
viny
got
more
sense
in
her
little
finger
than
me
an
you
has
got
in
our
whole
heads
she
can
doctor
better
with
them
yarbs
of
hers
than
any
physicianner
i
know
as
to
her
not
bein
a
member
she
lives
right
an
helps
other
folks
an
that
more
than
lots
of
members
does
besides
she
added
conclusively
wiggs
himself
was
no
chapter
viii
a
denominational
gardbn
oh
mickle
is
the
powerful
grace
that
lies
in
herbs
plants
stones
and
their
true
qualities
for
naught
so
vile
that
on
the
earth
doth
live
but
to
the
earth
some
special
good
doth
give
the
following
sunday
being
decidedly
cooler
lovey
mary
was
started
off
to
miss
viny
in
quest
of
yellowroot
she
had
protested
that
she
was
not
sick
but
miss
hazy
backed
by
wiggs
had
insisted
if
you
git
down
sick
it
would
be
a
orful
drain
on
me
was
miss
hazy
final
argument
and
the
point
was
effective
as
lovey
mary
trudged
along
the
she
was
unconscious
of
the
pleasant
changes
of
scenery
the
cottages
became
less
frequent
and
the
bare
dusty
commons
gave
place
to
green
fields
here
and
there
a
tree
spread
its
branches
to
the
breezes
and
now
and
then
a
snatch
of
bird
song
broke
the
stillness
but
lovey
mary
kept
gloomily
on
her
way
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
the
thoughts
surging
through
her
brain
were
dark
enough
to
obscure
even
the
sunshine
for
three
nights
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
the
nervous
sensations
were
getting
worse
instead
of
better
just
two
months
since
kate
was
hurt
she
said
to
herself
soon
as
she
gets
out
the
hospital
she
be
trying
to
find
us
again
i
believe
she
was
coming
to
the
factory
looking
for
me
when
she
got
run
over
she
just
like
to
take
tommy
away
and
send
me
to
jail
oh
i
hate
her
worse
all
the
time
i
wish
she
was
the
wish
died
on
her
lips
for
she
suddenly
realized
that
it
might
already
have
been
fulfilled
some
one
coughed
near
by
and
she
started
guiltily
you
seem
to
be
in
a
right
deep
steddy
said
a
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
lovey
mary
glanced
up
and
saw
a
old
woman
smiling
at
her
quizzically
a
pair
of
keen
eyes
twinkled
under
bushy
brows
and
a
fierce
little
beard
bristled
from
her
chin
when
she
smiled
it
made
lovey
mary
think
of
a
pebble
dropped
in
a
pool
for
the
wrinkles
went
rippling
off
from
her
mouth
in
circles
until
they
were
lost
in
the
gray
hair
under
her
hat
are
you
miss
viny
asked
lovey
mary
glancing
at
the
beyond
well
i
been
that
fer
sixty
year
i
ai
heared
of
no
change
answered
the
old
lady
miss
hazy
sent
me
after
some
yellowroot
said
lovey
mary
listlessly
who
fer
me
miss
viny
took
a
pair
of
large
spectacles
from
her
pocket
put
them
on
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
looked
over
them
critically
at
lovey
mary
stick
out
yer
tongue
lovey
mary
obeyed
it
a
good
thing
i
looked
you
do
no
more
need
yallerroot
than
a
bumblebee
you
come
in
here
on
the
porch
an
tell
me
ailin
you
an
i
do
my
own
prescriptin
lovey
mary
followed
her
up
the
narrow
path
that
ran
between
a
mass
of
flowers
snowy
oleanders
yellow
asters
and
purple
phlox
crowded
together
in
a
space
no
larger
than
miss
hazy
front
yard
lovey
mary
forgot
her
troubles
in
sheer
delight
in
seeing
so
many
flowers
together
do
you
love
too
asked
miss
viny
jerking
her
thumb
over
her
shoulder
i
guess
i
would
if
i
had
a
chance
i
never
saw
them
growing
out
of
doors
like
this
i
always
had
to
look
at
them
through
the
store
windows
oh
law
do
talk
to
me
flowers
i
do
in
shuttin
a
flower
up
in
a
greenhouse
any
more
i
in
myself
up
in
one
church
lovey
mary
remembered
what
miss
hazy
had
told
her
of
miss
pernicious
religious
views
and
she
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
miss
viny
was
started
upon
a
favorite
theme
and
was
not
to
be
diverted
this
here
is
a
denominational
garden
an
i
got
every
congregation
i
ever
heared
of
planted
in
it
i
ai
got
no
faverite
bed
i
keer
fer
all
jes
alike
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
the
same
rule
holds
good
in
startin
a
garden
as
does
in
startin
a
church
you
first
got
to
steddy
what
sort
of
soil
you
goin
to
work
with
then
you
have
to
sum
up
all
the
things
you
have
to
fight
next
you
choose
what
flowers
are
goin
to
hold
the
best
places
that
a
mighty
important
question
in
churches
too
ai
it
then
you
go
to
plantin
the
thicker
the
better
fer
in
both
you
got
to
allow
fer
a
mighty
off
after
that
you
must
take
good
keer
of
what
you
got
an
be
sure
to
plant
something
new
each
year
once
in
a
while
some
of
the
old
growths
has
to
be
thinned
out
and
the
new
upstarts
an
suckers
has
to
be
pulled
up
now
if
you
come
out
here
i
show
you
round
she
started
down
the
path
and
lovey
mary
somewhat
overwhelmed
by
this
oration
followed
obediently
these
here
are
the
baptists
said
miss
viny
waving
her
hand
toward
a
bed
of
heliotrope
and
flags
they
want
lots
of
water
like
to
be
wet
clean
through
they
sorter
set
off
to
theyselves
an
tend
to
their
own
business
do
keer
much
minglin
with
the
other
flowers
lovey
mary
did
not
understand
very
clearly
what
miss
viny
was
talking
about
but
she
was
glad
to
follow
her
in
the
winding
paths
where
new
beauties
were
waiting
at
every
turn
these
is
geraniums
ai
they
one
of
the
girls
had
one
once
in
a
when
she
was
sick

said
miss
viny

to
be
revived
they
like
lots
of
encouragement

easy
to

every
few
years
now
ai
that
methodist
down
to
the
ground
are
there
any
presbyterians
asked
lovey
mary
beginning
to
grasp
miss
viny
meaning
yes
indeed
they
are
a
good
old
reliable
bed
look
at
all
these
roses
an
an
dahlias
they
all
knew
what
they
was
to
be
afore
they
started
to
grow
they
was
elected
to
it
an
keep
on
bein
what
they
started
out
to
be
clean
to
the
very
end
i
know
about
predestination
cried
lovey
mary
eagerly
miss
bell
used
to
tell
us
all
those
things
who
did
lovey
mary
flushed
crimson
a
lady
i
used
to
know
she
said
evasively
miss
viny
crossed
the
garden
and
stopped
before
a
bed
of
stately
lilies
and
azaleas
these
are
she
explained
ai
they
tony
jes
look
like
they
thought
their
bed
was
the
only
one
in
the
garden
somebody
said
that
a
lily
did
have
no
pore
kin
among
the
flowers
it
ai
no
wonder
they
die
of
dignity
they
like
the
in
more
ways
one
both
hates
to
be
disturbed
both
likes
some
shade
an
confidentially
both
air
pretty
pernickity
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
ai
nothin
kin
touch
when
it
comes
to
beauty
i
think
all
the
other
beds
is
proud
of
if
you
come
to
look
into
it
why
look
at
weddin
an
funerals
do
all
the
churches
call
in
the
an
the
lilies
on
both
them
occasions
lovey
mary
nodded
vaguely
an
here
continued
miss
viny
are
the
unitarians
you
may
be
at
me
fer
havin
in
here
with
the
orthodox
churches
but
if
the
sun
an
the
rain
do
make
no
distinction
i
do
see
what
right
i
got
to
put
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
these
first
is
as
rich
in
bloom
as

of
any

i
ai
never

worst
kind
of

or
presbyterians
but
if
left
to

they
run
back
to
this
here

one
of
these
here
christians
that
so
busy
thinkin
dyin
that

chuckled
as
she
crumbled
the
dry
flower
in
her
fingers
see
how
different
this
is
she
said
plucking
a
sprig
of
verbena
this
an
the
mint

the
sage

the
lavender

all
true
christians
jes
by
bein
touched
they
give
out
a
influence
that
makes
the
whole
world
a
sweeter
place
to
live
in
but
after
all
they
all
be
alike
there
all
sorts
of
christians
some
stands
fer
sunshine
some
fer
shade
some
fer
beauty
some
fer
use
some
up
high
some
down
low
there
jes
one
thing
all
the
flowers
has
to
unite
in
fightin
that
the
hate
if
it
once
gits
in
a
plant
no
matter
how
good
an
strong
that
plant
may
be
it
eats
right
down
to
its
heart
how
do

perseverance
if

i
tryin
to
be
to
these

what
god

to
his
churches
the
sun
which

the
sperrit

to
shine
on

now
i
goin
to
cut
you
a
nice
to
carry
back
to
the
cabbage
patch
so
engrossed
were
the
two
in
selecting
and
arranging
the
flowers
that
neither
thought
of
the
yellowroot
or
its
substitute
nevertheless
as
lovey
mary
tramped
briskly
back
over
the
with
her
burden
of
blossoms
she
bore
a
new
thought
in
her
heart
which
was
destined
to
bring
about
a
surer
cure
than
any
of
miss
viny
most
efficient
herbs
chapter
ix
labor
day
and
cloudy
the
day
or
stormy
the
night
the
sky
of
her
heart
was
always
bright
it
would
me
none
if
we
had
cyclones
an
tornadoes
by
evenin
it
looks
so
thundery
outdoors
it
was
inconsiderate
of
miss
hazy
to
make
the
above
observation
in
the
very
face
of
the
most
elaborate
preparations
for
a
picnic
but
miss
hazy
evil
predictions
were
too
frequent
to
be
effective
i
scurry
round
an
git
another
loaf
of
bread
said
wiggs
briskly
as
she
put
a
tin
pail
into
the
corner
of
the
basket
lovey
mary
you
put
in
the
eggs
an
git
them

promised
them
boys
a
picnic
on
labor
day
an
we
are
goin
if
it
snows
awful
dangerous
in
the
woods
when
it
storms
continued
miss
hazy
i
heared
of
a
man
oncet
that
would
go
to
a
picnic
in
the
rain
and
he
got
struck
so
bad
it
burned
his
shoes
plump
off
must
have
been
the
same
man
that
got
drownded
when
he
was
little
fer
goin
in
swimmin
on
sunday
answered
wiggs
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
mebbe
was
said
miss
hazy
lovey
mary
vibrated
between
the
door
and
the
window
alternating
between
hope
and
despair
she
had
set
her
heart
on
the
picnic
with
the
same
intensity
of
desire
that
had
characterized
her
yearning
for
goodness
and
affection
and
curly
hair
i
believe
there
is
a
tiny
speck
more
blue
she
said
scanning
the
heavens
for
the
hundredth
time

mind
whether

not
she
would
go

wiggs
an
there
ai
a
meeker
hoss
in

he
looks
like
he
might
belonged
to
a
preacher
of
bein

hoss
an
unforeseen
delay
was
occasioned
by
a
heated
controversy
between
lovey
mary
and
tommy
concerning
the
advisability
of
taking
cusmoodle
there
ai
more
than
room
enough
to
squeeze
you
in

that
discretion

the
better
part
of
valor
here
a
nice
little
place
up
here
by
me
jes
big
enough
fer
you
an
cusmoodle
you
kin
set
on
the
basket
it
wo
mash
nothin
if
we
packed
in
good
an
tight
ca
none
of
us
fall
out
when
the
last
basket
was
stored
away
the
party
started
off
in
glee
leaving
miss
hazy
still
irresolute
in
the
doorway
declaring
that
she
almost
wisht
she
had
went
the
destination
had
not
been
decided
upon
so
it
was
discussed
as
the
wagon
jolted
along
over
the
cobblestones
let
go
out
past
miss
viny
suggested
jake
there
a
bully
woods
out
there
aw
no
let
go
to
tick
creek
an
go
in
wadin
wiggs
seated
high
above
the
party
and
slapping
the
reins
on
cuba
back
allowed
the
lively
debate
to
continue
until
trouble
threatened
then
she
interfered
i
think
it
would
be
nice
to
go
over
to
the
cemetery
we
have
to
cross
the
city
but
when
you
git
out
there
there
plenty
of
grass
trees
an
it
runs
right
the
river
the
proximity
of
the
river
decided
the
matter
i
wo
hardly
take
a
swim
said
jake
going
through
the
motions
to
the
discomfort
of
the
two
little
girls
who
were
hanging
their
feet
from
the
back
of
the
wagon
i
afraid
it
going
to
rain
so
hard
that
you
can
take
your
swim
before
you
get
there
said
lovey
mary
as
the
big
drops
began
to
fall
the
picnic
party
huddled
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
in
a
state
of
great
merriment
while
wiggs
spread
an
old
quilt
over
as
many
of
them
as
it
would
cover
ai
nothin
but
a
summer
shower
she
said
holding
her
head
on
one
side
to
keep
the
rain
from
driving
in
her
face
i
the
sun
is
shinin
at
the
cemetery
right
now
as
the
rickety
wagon
with
its
drenched
and
shivering
load
rattled
across
main
street
an
ominous
sound
fell
upon
the
air
two
three
one
two
wiggs
wrapped
the
lines
about
her
wrists
and
braced
herself
for
the
struggle
but
cuba
had
heard
the
summons
his
heart
had
responded
to
the
old
call
and
with
one
joyous
bound
he
started
for
the
fire
hold
on
tight
yelled
wiggs
do
none
of
you
fall
out
whoa
cuby
whoa
i
stop
him
in
a
minute
hold
tight
cuba
kicked
the
stiffness
out
of
his
legs
and
laying
his
ears
back
raced
valiantly
for
five
squares
neck
and
neck
with
the
but
the
odds
were
against
him
wiggs
and
chris
sawing
on
one
line
and
billy
and
jake
pulling
on
the
other
proved
too
heavy
a
handicap
within
sight
of
the
fire
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
it
the
called
chris
climbing
over
the
wheels
looks
like
the
whole
town
on
fire
let
unhitch
cuby
an
tie
him
an
stand
in
the
wagon
an
watch
it
cried
wiggs
in
great
excitement
the
boys
were
not
content
to
be
stationary
so
they
rushed
away
leaving
wiggs
and
the
girls
with
tommy
and
the
duck
to
view
the
conflagration
at
a
safe
distance
for
two
hours
the
fire
raged
leaping
from
one
stack
of
lumber
to
another
and
threatening
the
adjacent
buildings
every
in
the
department
was
called
out
the
commons
were
black
with
people
and
the
excitement
was
intense
ai
you
glad
we
come
cried
lovey
mary
dancing
up
and
down
in
the
wagon
we
never
come
we
was
brought
said
asia
long
before
the
fire
was
under
control
the
sun
had
come
through
the
clouds
and
was
shining
brightly
picnics
however
were
not
to
be
considered
when
an
attraction
like
this
was
to
be
had
when
the
boys
finally
came
straggling
back
the
fire
was
nearly
out
the
crowd
had
dispersed
and
only
the
picnic
party
was
left
on
the
commons
it
too
late
to
start
to
the
cemetery
said
wiggs
thoughtfully
what
do
you
all
think
of
havin
the
picnic
right
here
an
now
the
suggestion
was
regarded
as
nothing
short
of
an
inspiration
the
only
trouble
continued
wiggs
is
the
water
where
we
goin
to
git
any
to
drink

know
one
of
the

billy
that

wiggs
meanwhile
chris
had
seized
the
hint
and
the
bucket
and
was
off
in
search
of
peter
jenkins
whose
name
would
prove
an
open
sesame
to
that
small
boy
paradise
the
engine
side
of
the
rope
the
old
quilt
still
damp
was
spread
on
the
ground
and
around
it
sat
the
picnic
party
partaking
ravenously
of
dry
sandwiches
and
cheese
and
cheer
such
laughing
and
crowding
and
romping
as
there
was
jake
gave
correct
imitations
of
everybody
in
the
cabbage
patch
chris
did
some
marvelous
stunts
with
his
wooden
leg
and
lovey
mary
sang
every
funny
song
that
she
knew
wiggs
stood
in
the
wagon
above
them
and
dispensed
hospitality
as
long
as
it
lasted
cuba
hitched
to
a
fence
near
by
needed
no
material
nourishment
he
was
contentedly
sniffing
the
air
and
living
over
again
the
days
of
his
youth
when
the
party
reached
home
tired
and
grimy
they
were
still
enthusiastic
over
the
fine
time
they
had
had
it
jes
the
way
i
said
proclaimed
wiggs
as
she
drove
up
with
a
flourish
you
never
kin
tell
which
way
pleasure
is
who
ever
would
thought
when
we
aimed
at
the
cemetery

confusion
the
telephone
was
ringing

responded
instantly
to
the
need
of
the

long
dainty
room
full
of
beautiful
things
she
only
saw

grasping
the

by
his
feet
held
him
at

the

was
rushing
in
with

milk
dropped
the
cup

a
tiny
piece
of
hard
candy
lay
on

floor

up

sobbing
himself
quiet
in

excitement
had
subsided
and

doctors
and
redding
had
arrived
breathless
upon
the

time
lavished
her
gratitude
upon

slipped
a
bill
into

had
actually
given

a
kiss

his
suggestions
with
burning
zeal
refitted
the
costumes
constructed
scenery
hammered
her
own
nails
as
well
as
the
iron
ones
and
finally
succeeded
in
putting
into
practice
his
rather
vague
theories
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
a
person
of
importance
besides
her
numerous
other
duties
she
prepared
an
elaborate
costume

dejectedly
in
the
corner
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
apron

she
suggested
as
a
forlorn
hope
when
wiggs
was
told
the
trouble
she
smiled
reassuringly
emergencies
were
to
her
the
spice
of
life
they
furnished
opportunities
for
the
expression
of
her
genius
hush

highly
satisfactory
that

to
everybody
but
tommy
he
complained
that
there
was
no
room
to
set
down
on
christmas
night
the
aristocracy
of
the
cabbage
patch
assembled
in
the
to
enjoy
the
double
attraction
of
a
christmas
tree
and
an
entertainment
rothchild
who
had
arranged
the
tree
for
the
last
ten
years
refused
to
have
it
moved
from
its
accustomed
place
which
was
almost
in
the
center
of
the
platform
he
had
been
earnestly
remonstrated
with
but
he
and
the
tree
remained
firm
rothchild
and
all
the
little
rothchildren
had
climbed
in
by
the
window
before
the
doors
were
open
in
order
to
secure
the
front
seats
immediately
behind
them
sat
the
hazys
and
the
wiggses
that
there
is
the
seminary
student
gittin
up
now
whispered
wiggs
he
goin
to
call

washed
out
looks
like

go
into
a
trance
fer
fifty
cents
hush
australia
do
you
see
he
is
goin
to
pray
after
the
opening
prayer
the
young
preacher
suggested
that
as
long
as
the
speakers
were
not
quite
ready
the
audience
should
raise
a
hymn
he
got
a
fine
voice
whispered
miss
hazy
i
heared
say
he
was
the
gentleman
soprano
at
a
church
when
the
religious
exercises
were
completed
the
audience
settled
into
a
state
of
pleasurable
anticipation
the
first
feature
of
the
entertainment
announced
the
preacher
will
be
a
song
by
miss
europena
wiggs
illustration
europena
stepped
forward
europena
stepped
forward
and
with
hands
close
to
her
sides
and
anguished
eyes
on
the
ceiling
gasped
forth
the
agonized
query
can
she
make
a
billy
boy
billy
boy
can
she
make
a
charming
billy
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
were
eight
verses
an
encore
was
demanded
wiggs
rose
in
her
seat
and
beckoned
vehemently
to
europena
come
on
back
she
motioned
violently
with
her
lips
they
want
you
to
come
back
europena
in
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
returned
to
the
stage
say
another
speech
whispered
wiggs
leaning
over
so
far
that
she
knocked
rothchild
bonnet
awry
still
europena
stood
there
an
evident
victim
of
lockjaw
have
a
little
finger
prompted
her
mother
frantically
from
the
second
row
front
a
single
ray
of
intelligence
flickered
for
a
moment
over
the
face
and
with
a
supreme
effort
she
said
i
have
a
little
finger
an
i
have
a
little
beau
when
i
get
a
little
bigger
i
have
a
little
toe
well
she
got
it
all
in
said
wiggs
in
a
relieved
tone
as
europena
was
lifted
down
after
this
other
little
girls
came
forward
and
made
some
unintelligible
remarks
concerning
santa
claus
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
they
went
through
their
parts
for
rothchild
kept
getting
in
the
way
as
he
calmly
and
uncompromisingly
continued
to
hang
cornucopias
on
the
tree
songs
and
recitations
followed
but
even
the
youngest
spectator
realized
that
these
were
only
preliminary
skirmishes
at
last
a
bell
rang
two
bedspreads
which
served
as
curtains
were
majestically
withdrawn
a
sigh
of
admiration
swept
the
room
ai
he
cute
whispered
a
girl
in
the
rear
as
billy
rose
resplendent
in
pink
tights
and
crimson
doublet
and
folding
his
arms
high
on
his
breast
recited
in
a
deep
voice
i
have
alas
philosophy
medicine
jurisprudence
too
and
to
my
cost
theology
with
ardent
labor
studied
through
i
do
see
no
sense
in
what
he
sayin
at
all
whispered
miss
hazy
it
jes
what
was
in
the
book
answered
wiggs
i
heared
him
repeat
it
off
before
supper
the
entrance
of
jake
awakened
the
flagging
interest
nobody
understood
what
he
said
either
but
he
made
horrible
faces
and
waved
his
red
arms
and
caused
a
pleasant
diversion
maw
what
john
bagby
round
in
that
little
saucer
asked
australia
fer
the
mercy
sake
i
do
know
answered
her
mother
craning
her
neck
to
see
john
with
creaking
footsteps
tiptoed
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
stooping
down
began
to
mix
a
concoction
in
a
plate
many
stood
up
to
see
what
he
was
doing
and
conjecture
was
rife
and
were
forgotten
until
jake
struck
a
heroic
pose
and
grasping
arm
said
hoarsely
gaze
faustis
gaze
into
pairdition
john
put
a
match
to
the
powder
a
bright
red
light
filled
the
room
and
the
audience
following
the
of
the
impassioned
gazed
into
the
placid
stupid
faces
of
four
meek
little
boys
on
the
mourners
bench
illustration
sang
in
a
high
sweet
voice
need
thee
every
hour
before
the
violent
coughing
caused
by
the
calcium
fumes
had
ceased
a
vision
in
white
squeezed
past
rothchild
and
came
slowly
down
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
it
was
lovey
mary
as
her
long
dress
swept
about
her
feet
her
heavy
hair
hung
in
thick
braids
over
both
shoulders
and
a
burning
red
spot
glowed
on
each
cheek
for
a
moment
she
stood
as
jake
had
directed
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
cast
heavenward
then
she
began
to
recite
the
words
poured
from
her
lips
with
a
volubility
that
would
have
shamed
an
auctioneer
it
was
a
long
part
full
of
hard
words
but
she
knew
it
perfectly
and
was
determined
to
show
how
fast
she
could
say
it
without
making
a
mistake
it
was
only
when
she
finished
that
she
paused
for
breath
then
she
turned
slowly
and
stretching
forth
appealing
arms
to
sang
in
a
high
sweet
voice
i
need
thee
every
hour
the
effect
was
electrical
at
last
the
cabbage
patch
understood
what
was
going
on
the
roof
rang
with
applause
even
rothchild
held
aside
his
strings
of
to
let
pass
out
s
more
s
more
was
the
cry
sing
it
jake
stepped
before
the
curtain
if
our
friends
is
willin
he
said
we
repeat
over
the
last
ak
again
lovey
mary
scored
a
triumph
john
bagby
burned
the
rest
of
the
calcium
powder
during
the
last
verse
and
the
entertainment
concluded
in
a
prolonged
cheer
chapter
xii
reaction
our
remedies
oft
in
ourselves
do
lie
when
the
paint
and
powder
had
been
washed
off
and
tommy
had
with
difficulty
been
extracted
from
his
new
trousers
and
put
to
bed
lovey
mary
sat
before
the
little
stove
and
thought
it
all
over
it
had
been
the
very
happiest
time
of
her
whole
life
how
nice
it
was
to
be
praised
and
made
much
of
wiggs
had
started
it
by
calling
everybody
attention
to
her
good
points
then
redding
had
sought
her
out
and
shown
her
continued
attention
was
the
great
climax
her
name
had
been
on
every
tongue
her
praises
sung
on
every
side
and
billy
wiggs
had
given
her
everything
he
got
off
the
christmas
tree
i
wisht
i
deserved
it
all
she
said
as
she
got
up
to
pull
the
blanket
closer
about
tommy
i
tried
to
be
good
i
guess
i
am
better
in
some
ways
but
not
in
all
not
in
all
she
knelt
by
the
bed
and
held
tommy
hand
to
her
cheek
sometimes
he
looks
like
kate
when
he
asleep
like
this
i
wonder
if
she
got
well
i
wonder
if
she
ever
misses
him
for
a
long
time
she
knelt
there
holding
the
warm
little
hand
in
hers
the
play
the
success
the
applause
were
all
forgotten
and
in
their
place
was
a
shame
a
humiliation
that
brought
the
hot
tears
to
her
eyes
i
ai
what
they
think
i
am
she
whispered
brokenly
i
a
mean
bad
girl
after
all
the
there
miss
viny
said
there
never
would
be
a
beautiful
flower
till
the
was
killed
but
i
want
to
be
good
i
want
to
be
what
they
think
i
am
again
and
again
the
old
thoughts
of
kate
rose
to
taunt
and
madden
her
but
a
new
power
was
at
work
it
brought
new
thoughts
of
kate
of
kate
sick
and
helpless
of
kate
without
friends
and
lonely
calling
for
her
baby
through
the
night
the
battle
raged
within
her
when
the
first
gray
streaks
showed
through
the
shutters
lovey
mary
cleaned
her
room
and
put
on
her
sunday
dress
i
be
a
little
late
to
the
factory
she
explained
to
miss
hazy
at
breakfast
for
i
got
to
go
on
errand
it
was
an
early
hour
for
visitors
at
the
city
hospital
but
when
lovey
mary
stated
her
business
she
was
shown
to
kate
ward
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
room
with
her
bandaged
head
turned
to
the
wall
lay
kate
when
the
nurse
spoke
to
her
she
turned
her
head
painfully
and
looked
at
them
listlessly
with
great
black
eyes
that
stared
forth
from
a
face
wasted
and
wan
from
suffering
kate
said
lovey
mary
leaning
across
the
bed
and
touching
her
hand
kate
do
you
know
me
the
pale
lips
tightened
over
the
prominent
white
teeth
well
i
swan
lovey
mary
where
you
come
from
not
waiting
for
an
answer
she
continued
querulously
say
ca
you
get
me
out
of
this
hole
someway
but
even
if
i
had
the
strength
to
crawl
i
would
have
no
place
to
go
ca
you
take
me
away
anywhere
would
do
lovey
mary
spirits
fell
she
had
nerved
herself
for
a
great
sacrifice
had
decided
to
do
her
duty
at
any
cost
but
thinking
of
it
beforehand
in
her
little
garret
room
with
tommy
hand
in
hers
and
kate
rider
a
mere
abstraction
was
very
different
from
facing
the
real
issue
with
the
old
selfish
heartless
kate
in
flesh
and
blood
before
her
she
let
go
of
kate
hand
do
you
want
to
know
about
tommy
she
asked
i
come
to
say
i
was
sorry

off
with
him
it
was
mighty
nervy
in
you
i
knew

good
care
of
him
though
but
say
you
can
get
me
away
from
this
ca

here
where

a
street
corner
and
run
a
where

the
cabbage

said
lovey
mary
with
the
old
repulsion
strong
upon
her
where

cabbage
patch

your
sort
of
a
place
kate
the
folks

good
and
honest
but
they
are
poor
and
plain

laugh
at
kate
turned
her
eyes
to
the
window
and
was
silent
a
moment
before
she
said
slowly

much
right
to
laugh
at

be
sorter
glad
to

thin
hand
across
to

in

and

trembled
there
was
a
queer
little
spasm
at

dead
when
a
carriage
drove
up
to
miss
hazy

was
easy
to

precedent
in

cabbage

when
a
certain
course
of
action
was
once
understood
to
be
the
proper
thing
every
resident
promptly
fell
in
line
the
victim
of
celebrated
concussion
was
overwhelmed
with
attention
she

pink
wrapper
in

and
received
the
homage
of
the
neighborhood

softly
down

into
the
low
room
and
climbed
on

put
his
plump
cheek
against
the
thin
one
and
whispered
words
of
love
kate
muscles
relaxed
as
her
arms
folded
about
him
gradually
her
sobs
ceased
and
her
pulse
grew
faint
and
fainter
outside
the
rain
and
sleet
beat
on
the
cracked
but
a
peace
had
entered
the
dingy
little
room
kate
received
the
great
summons
with
a
smile
for
in
one
fleeting
moment
she
had
felt
for
the
first
and
last
time
the
blessed
sanctity
of
motherhood
chapter

an
honorable
retreat
for
i
will
ease
my
heart
although
it
be
with
hazard
of
my
head
miss
bell
sat
in
her
neat
little
office
with
the
evening
paper
in
her
hand
the
hour
before
tea
was
the
one
time
of
the
day
she
reserved
for
herself
susie
smithers
declared
that
she
sat
before
the
fire
at
such
times
and
took
naps
but
susie
knowledge
was
not
always
trustworthy
it
depended
entirely
on
the
position
of
the
keyhole
at
any
rate
miss
bell
was
not
sleeping
she
moved
about
restlessly
brushing
imaginary
ashes
from
the
spotless
hearth
staring
absently
into
the
fire
then
recurring
again
and
again
to
an
item
in
the
paper
which
she
held
died
kate
rider
in
her
year
from
injuries
received
in
an
accident
miss
bell
seemed
to
cringe
before
the
words
her
face
looked
old
and
drawn
and
to
think
i
kept
her
from
having
her
child
she
said
to
herself
as
she
paced
up
and
down
the
narrow
room
no
matter
what
else
kate
was
she
was
his
mother
and
had
the
first
right
to
him
but
i
acted
for
the
best
i
could
see
no
other
way
if
i
had
only
known
illustration
susie
smithers
at
the
keyhole
there
were
steps
on
the
pavement
without
she
went
to
the
window
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
gazed
into
the
gathering
dusk
some
one
was
coming
up
the
walk
some
one
very
short
and
fat
no
it
was
a
girl
carrying
a
child
miss
bell
reached
the
door
just
in
time
to
catch
tommy
in
her
arms
as
lovey
mary
staggered
into
the
hall
they
were
covered
with
sleet
and
almost
numb
from
the
cold
kate
dead
cried
lovey
mary
as
miss
bell
hurried
them
into
the
office
i
did
know
she
was
going
to
die
oh
i
been
so
wicked
to
you
and
to
kate
and
to
god
i
want
to
be
arrested
i
do
care
what
they
do
to
me
she
threw
herself
on
the
floor
and
beat
her
fists
on
the
carpet
tommy
stood
near
and
wept
in
sympathy
he
wore
his
remnant
trousers
and
his
little
straw
hat
round
which
wiggs
had
sewn
a
broad
band
of
black
miss
bell
hovered
over
lovey
mary
and
patted
her
nervously
on
the
back
do
my
dear
do
cry
so
it
very
sad
dear
me
yes
very
sad
you
are
alone
to
blame
though
i
have
been
at
fault
too
i
i
feel
dreadfully
about
it
miss
bell
face
was
undergoing
such
painful
contortions
that
lovey
mary
stopped
crying
in
alarm
and
tommy
got
behind
a
chair
of
course
continued
miss
bell
gaining
control
of
herself
it
was
very
wrong
of
you
to
run
away
mary
when
i
discovered
that
you
had
gone
i
never
stopped
until
i
found
you
till
you
found
me
gasped
lovey
mary
yes
child
i
knew
where
you
were
all
the
time
again
miss
bell
features
were
convulsed
and
mary
and
tommy
looked
on
in
awed
silence
you
see
she
went
on
presently
i
am
just
as
much
at
fault
as
you
i
was
worried
and
distressed
over
having
to
let
tommy
go
with
kate
yet
there
seemed
no
way
out
of
it
when
i
found
you
had
hidden
him
away
in
a
safe
place
that
you
were
both
well
and
happy
i
determined
to
keep
your
secret
but
oh
mary
we
had
the
right
to
keep
him
from
her
perhaps
the
child
would
have
been
her
salvation
perhaps
she
would
have
died
a
good
girl
but
she
did
miss
bell
said
lovey
mary
earnestly
she
said
she
was
sorry
again
and
again
and
when
she
went
to
sleep
tommy
arms
was
round
her
neck
mary
cried
miss
bell
seizing
the
girl
hand
eagerly
did
you
find
her
and
take
him
to
her
no
i
brought
her
to
him
she
did
have
no
place
to
go
and
i
wanted
to
make
up
to
her
for
hating
her
so
i
did
i
could
to
make
her
well
we
all
did
i
never
thought
she
was
going
to
die
then
at
miss
bell
request
lovey
mary
told
her
story
with
many
sobs
and
tears
but
some
smiles
in
between
over
the
good
times
in
the
cabbage
patch
and
when
she
had
finished
miss
bell
led
her
over
to
the
sofa
and
put
her
arms
about
her
they
had
lived
under
the
same
roof
for
fifteen
years
and
she
had
never
before
given
her
a
caress
mary
she
said
you
did
for
kate
what
nobody
else
could
have
done
i
thank
god
that
it
all
happened
as
it
did
but
you
orter
scold
me
and
punish
me
said
lovey
mary
i
feel
better
if
you
did
tommy
realizing
in
some
vague
way
that
a
was
in
progress
and
always
ready
to
echo
lovey
mary
sentiments
laid
his
chubby
hand
on
miss
bell
knee
when
my
little
sled
drows
up
i
doin
to
take
you
ridin
he
said
confidingly
miss
bell
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
the
knotty
problem
which
had
caused
her
many
sleepless
nights
had
at
last
found
its
own
solution

it
was
june
again
and
once
more
lovey
mary
stood
at
an
window
at
the
home
on
the
ledge
grew
a
row
of
bright
flowers
brought
from
miss
viny
garden
but
they
were
no
brighter
than
the
face
that
smiled
across
them
at
the
small
boy
in
the
playground
below
lovey
mary
sleeves
were
rolled
above
her
elbows
and
a
was
tied
about
her
head
as
she
returned
to
her
sweeping

sang

miss
bell
says
for
you
to
come
down
to
the
office
announced
a
little
girl
coming
up
the
steps
there
a
lady
there
and
a
baby
lovey
mary
paused
in
her
work
and
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
just
three
years
ago
the
same
summons
had
come
and
with
it
such
heartaches
and
anxiety
she
pulled
down
her
sleeves
and
went
thoughtfully
down
the
steps
at
the
office
door
she
found
redding
talking
to
miss
bell
we
leave
saturday
afternoon
she
was
saying
it
rather
sooner
than
we
expected
but
we
want
to
get
the
baby
to
canada
before
the
hot
weather
overtakes
us
last
summer
i
asked
two
children
from
the
toronto
home
to
spend
two
weeks
with
me
at
our
summer
place
but
this
year
i
have
set
my
heart
on
taking
lovey
mary
and
tommy
they
will
see
niagara
falls
and
buffalo
where
we
stop
over
a
day
besides
the
little
outing
at
the
lake
will
you
come
mary
you
know
robert
might
get
choked
again
lovey
mary
leaned
against
the
door
for
support
a
visit
to
redding
was
excitement
for
a
week
and
only
to
think
of
going
away
with
her
and
riding
on
a
and
seeing
a
lake
and
taking
tommy
and
being
ever
so
small
a
part
of
that
gorgeous
redding
household
she
could
not
speak
she
just
looked
up
and
smiled
but
the
smile
seemed
to
mean
more
than
words
for
it
brought
the
sudden
tears
to
redding
eyes
she
gave
mary
hand
a
quick
understanding
little
squeeze
then
hurried
out
to
her
carriage
that
very
afternoon
lovey
mary
went
to
the
cabbage
patch
as
she
hurried
along
over
the
familiar
ground
she
felt
as
if
she
must
sing
aloud
the
happy
song
that
was
humming
in
her
heart
she
wanted
to
stop
at
each
cottage
and
tell
the
good
news
but
her
time
was
limited
so
she
kept
on
her
way
to
miss
hazy
merely
calling
out
a
greeting
as
she
passed
when
she
reached
the
door
she
heard
wiggs
voice
in
animated
conversation
well
i
wish
you
look
there
she
is
this
very
minute
i
never
was
so
glad

tongue
in
the
empty
place
after

tooth
done
pulled
out
i
awful
glad
to
be
back
said
lovey
mary

happy
to
be
cast
down
by
the
reversion
to
the
original
state
of
the
hazy
household
me
