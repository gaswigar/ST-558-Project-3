the
witch
of
atlas
by
percy
bysshe
shelley
to
mary
on
her
objecting
to
the
following
poem
upon
the
score
of
its
containing
no
human
interest
how
my
dear
mary
are
you
for
vipers
kill
though
dead
by
some
review
that
you
condemn
these
verses
i
have
written
because
they
tell
no
story
false
or
true
what
though
no
mice
are
caught
by
a
young
kitten
may
it
not
leap
and
play
as
grown
cats
do
till
its
claws
come
prithee
for
this
one
time
content
thee
with
a
visionary
rhyme
what
hand
would
crush
the
fly
the
youngest
of
inconstant
april
minions
because
it
can
not
climb
the
purest
sky
where
the
swan
sings
amid
the
sun
dominions
not
thine
thou
knowest
is
its
doom
to
die
when
day
shall
hide
within
her
twilight
pinions
the
lucent
eyes
and
the
eternal
smile
serene
as
thine
which
lent
it
life
awhile
to
thy
fair
feet
a
winged
vision
came
whose
date
should
have
been
longer
than
a
day
and
thy
head
did
beat
its
wings
for
fame
and
in
thy
sight
its
fading
plumes
display
the
watery
bow
burned
in
the
evening
flame
but
the
shower
fell
the
swift
sun
went
his
way
and
that
is
o
let
me
not
believe
that
anything
of
mine
is
fit
to
live
wordsworth
informs
us
he
was
nineteen
years
considering
and
retouching
peter
bell
watering
his
laurels
with
the
killing
tears
of
slow
dull
care
so
that
their
roots
to
hell
might
pierce
and
their
wide
branches
blot
the
spheres
of
heaven
with
dewy
leaves
and
flowers
this
well
may
be
for
heaven
and
earth
conspire
to
foil
the
gardener
blundering
toil
my
witch
indeed
is
not
so
sweet
a
creature
as
ruth
or
lucy
whom
his
graceful
praise
clothes
for
our
grandsons
but
she
matches
peter
though
he
took
nineteen
years
and
she
three
days
in
dressing
light
the
vest
of
flowing
metre
she
wears
he
proud
as
dandy
with
his
stays
has
hung
upon
his
wiry
limbs
a
dress
like
king
lear
and
windowed
raggedness
if
you
strip
peter
you
will
see
a
fellow
scorched
by
hell
hyperequatorial
climate
into
a
kind
of
a
sulphureous
yellow
a
lean
mark
hardly
fit
to
fling
a
rhyme
at
in
shape
a
scaramouch
in
hue
othello
if
you
unveil
my
witch
no
priest
nor
primate
can
shrive
you
of
that
sin
if
sin
there
be
in
love
when
it
becomes
idolatry
the
witch
of
atlas
before
those
cruel
twins
whom
at
one
birth
incestuous
change
bore
to
her
father
time
error
and
truth
had
hunted
from
the
earth
all
those
bright
natures
which
adorned
its
prime
and
left
us
nothing
to
believe
in
worth
the
pains
of
putting
into
learned
rhyme
a
there
lived
on
atlas
mountain
within
a
cavern
by
a
secret
fountain
her
mother
was
one
of
the
atlantides
the
sun
had
beholden
in
his
wide
voyage
continents
and
seas
so
fair
a
creature
as
she
lay
enfolden
in
the
warm
shadow
of
her
loveliness
he
kissed
her
with
his
beams
and
made
all
golden
the
chamber
of
gray
rock
in
which
she
lay
she
in
that
dream
of
joy
dissolved
away
is
said
she
first
was
changed
into
a
vapour
and
then
into
a
cloud
such
clouds
as
flit
like
moths
about
a
taper
round
the
red
west
when
the
sun
dies
in
it
and
then
into
a
meteor
such
as
caper
on
when
the
moon
is
in
a
fit
then
into
one
of
those
mysterious
stars
which
hide
themselves
between
the
earth
and
mars
ten
times
the
mother
of
the
months
had
bent
her
bow
beside
the
and
bidden
with
that
bright
sign
the
billows
to
indent
the
sand
like
children
chidden
at
her
command
they
ever
came
and
went
since
in
that
cave
a
dewy
splendour
hidden
took
shape
and
motion
with
the
living
form
of
this
embodied
power
the
cave
grew
warm
a
lovely
lady
garmented
in
light
from
her
own
beauty
deep
her
eyes
as
are
two
openings
of
unfathomable
night
seen
through
a
temple
cloven
roof
her
hair
dark
the
dim
brain
whirls
dizzy
with
delight
picturing
her
form
her
soft
smiles
shone
afar
and
her
low
voice
was
heard
like
love
and
drew
all
living
things
towards
this
wonder
new
and
first
the
spotted
cameleopard
came
and
then
the
wise
and
fearless
elephant
then
the
sly
serpent
in
the
golden
flame
of
his
own
volumes
intervolved
all
gaunt
and
sanguine
beasts
her
gentle
looks
made
tame
they
drank
before
her
at
her
sacred
fount
and
every
beast
of
beating
heart
grew
bold
such
gentleness
and
power
even
to
behold
the
brinded
lioness
led
forth
her
young
that
she
might
teach
them
how
they
should
forego
their
inborn
thirst
of
death
the
pard
unstrung
his
sinews
at
her
feet
and
sought
to
know
with
looks
whose
motions
spoke
without
a
tongue
how
he
might
be
as
gentle
as
the
doe
the
magic
circle
of
her
voice
and
eyes
all
savage
natures
did
imparadise
and
old
silenus
shaking
a
green
stick
of
lilies
and
the
in
a
crew
came
blithe
as
in
the
olive
copses
thick
cicadae
are
drunk
with
the
noonday
dew
and
dryope
and
faunus
followed
quick
teasing
the
god
to
sing
them
something
new
till
in
this
cave
they
found
the
lady
lone
sitting
upon
a
seat
of
emerald
stone
and
universal
pan
is
said
was
there
and
though
none
saw
him
through
the
adamant
of
the
deep
mountains
through
the
trackless
air
and
through
those
living
spirits
like
a
want
he
passed
out
of
his
everlasting
lair
where
the
quick
heart
of
the
great
world
doth
pant
and
felt
that
wondrous
lady
all
alone
and
she
felt
him
upon
her
emerald
throne
and
every
nymph
of
stream
and
spreading
tree
and
every
shepherdess
of
ocean
flocks
who
drives
her
white
waves
over
the
green
sea
and
ocean
with
the
brine
on
his
gray
locks
and
quaint
priapus
with
his
company
all
came
much
wondering
how
the
enwombed
rocks
could
have
brought
forth
so
beautiful
a
birth
her
love
subdued
their
wonder
and
their
mirth
the
herdsmen
and
the
mountain
maidens
came
and
the
rude
kings
of
pastoral
garamant
their
spirits
shook
within
them
as
a
flame
stirred
by
the
air
under
a
cavern
gaunt
pigmies
and
polyphemes
by
many
a
name
centaurs
and
satyrs
and
such
shapes
as
haunt
wet
clefts
and
lumps
neither
alive
nor
dead
and
for
she
was
beautiful
her
beauty
made
the
bright
world
dim
and
everything
beside
seemed
like
the
fleeting
image
of
a
shade
no
thought
of
living
spirit
could
abide
which
to
her
looks
had
ever
been
betrayed
on
any
object
in
the
world
so
wide
on
any
hope
within
the
circling
skies
but
on
her
form
and
in
her
inmost
eyes
which
when
the
lady
knew
she
took
her
spindle
and
twined
three
threads
of
fleecy
mist
and
three
long
lines
of
light
such
as
the
dawn
may
kindle
the
clouds
and
waves
and
mountains
with
and
she
as
many
ere
their
lamps
could
dwindle
in
the
belated
moon
wound
skilfully
and
with
these
threads
a
subtle
veil
she
wove
a
shadow
for
the
splendour
of
her
love
the
deep
recesses
of
her
odorous
dwelling
were
stored
with
magic
treasures
sounds
of
air
which
had
the
power
all
spirits
of
compelling
folded
in
cells
of
crystal
silence
there
such
as
we
hear
in
youth
and
think
the
feeling
will
never
die
yet
ere
we
are
aware
the
feeling
and
the
sound
are
fled
and
gone
and
the
regret
they
leave
remains
alone
and
there
lay
visions
swift
and
sweet
and
quaint
each
in
its
thin
sheath
like
a
chrysalis
some
eager
to
burst
forth
some
weak
and
faint
with
the
soft
burthen
of
intensest
bliss
it
was
its
work
to
bear
to
many
a
saint
whose
heart
adores
the
shrine
which
holiest
is
even
love
and
others
white
green
gray
and
black
and
of
all
shapes
and
each
was
at
her
beck
and
odours
in
a
kind
of
aviary
of
she
kept
clipped
in
a
floating
net
a
fairy
had
woven
from
while
the
moon
yet
slept
as
bats
at
the
wired
window
of
a
dairy
they
beat
their
vans
and
each
was
an
adept
when
loosed
and
missioned
making
wings
of
winds
to
stir
sweet
thoughts
or
sad
in
destined
minds
and
liquors
clear
and
sweet
whose
healthful
might
could
medicine
the
sick
soul
to
happy
sleep
and
change
eternal
death
into
a
night
of
glorious
dreams
or
if
eyes
needs
must
weep
could
make
their
tears
all
wonder
and
delight
she
in
her
crystal
vials
did
closely
keep
if
men
could
drink
of
those
clear
vials
is
said
the
living
were
not
envied
of
the
dead
her
cave
was
stored
with
scrolls
of
strange
device
the
works
of
some
saturnian
archimage
which
taught
the
expiations
at
whose
price
men
from
the
gods
might
win
that
happy
age
too
lightly
lost
redeeming
native
vice
and
which
might
quench
the
rage
of
gold
and
blood
till
men
should
live
and
move
harmonious
as
the
sacred
stars
above
and
how
all
things
that
seem
untameable
not
to
be
checked
and
not
to
be
confined
obey
the
spells
of
wisdom
wizard
skill
time
earth
and
fire
the
ocean
and
the
wind
and
all
their
shapes
and
man
imperial
will
and
other
scrolls
whose
writings
did
unbind
the
inmost
lore
of
love
let
the
profane
tremble
to
ask
what
secrets
they
contain
and
wondrous
works
of
substances
unknown
to
which
the
enchantment
of
her
father
power
had
changed
those
ragged
blocks
of
savage
stone
were
heaped
in
the
recesses
of
her
bower
carved
lamps
and
chalices
and
vials
which
shone
in
their
own
golden
beams
each
like
a
flower
out
of
whose
depth
a
shakes
his
light
under
a
cypress
in
a
starless
night
at
first
she
lived
alone
in
this
wild
home
and
her
own
thoughts
were
each
a
minister
clothing
themselves
or
with
the
ocean
foam
or
with
the
wind
or
with
the
speed
of
fire
to
work
whatever
purposes
might
come
into
her
mind
such
power
her
mighty
sire
had
girt
them
with
whether
to
fly
or
run
through
all
the
regions
which
he
shines
upon
the
and
hamadryades
oreads
and
naiads
with
long
weedy
locks
offered
to
do
her
bidding
through
the
seas
under
the
earth
and
in
the
hollow
rocks
and
far
beneath
the
matted
roots
of
trees
and
in
the
gnarled
heart
of
stubborn
oaks
so
they
might
live
for
ever
in
the
light
of
her
sweet
presence
each
a
satellite
may
not
be
the
wizard
maid
replied
fountains
where
the
naiades
bedew
their
shining
hair
at
length
are
drained
and
dried
the
solid
oaks
forget
their
strength
and
strew
their
latest
leaf
upon
the
mountains
wide
the
boundless
ocean
like
a
drop
of
dew
will
be
consumed
the
stubborn
centre
must
be
scattered
like
a
cloud
of
summer
dust
ye
with
them
will
perish
one
by
one
if
i
must
sigh
to
think
that
this
shall
be
if
i
must
weep
when
the
surviving
sun
shall
smile
on
your
decay
oh
ask
not
me
to
love
you
till
your
little
race
is
run
i
can
not
die
as
ye
must
over
me
your
leaves
shall
glance
the
streams
in
which
ye
dwell
shall
be
my
paths
henceforth
and
so
farewell
she
spoke
and
wept
the
dark
and
azure
well
sparkled
beneath
the
shower
of
her
bright
tears
and
every
little
circlet
where
they
fell
flung
to
the
inconstant
spheres
and
intertangled
lines
of
light
a
knell
of
sobbing
voices
came
upon
her
ears
from
those
departing
forms
the
serene
of
the
white
streams
and
of
the
forest
green
all
day
the
wizard
lady
sate
aloof
spelling
out
scrolls
of
dread
antiquity
under
the
cavern
roof
or
broidering
the
pictured
poesy
of
some
high
tale
upon
her
growing
woof
which
the
sweet
splendour
of
her
smiles
could
dye
in
hues
outshining
heaven
and
ever
she
added
some
grace
to
the
wrought
poesy
while
on
her
hearth
lay
blazing
many
a
piece
of
sandal
wood
rare
gums
and
cinnamon
men
scarcely
know
how
beautiful
fire
is
each
flame
of
it
is
as
a
precious
stone
dissolved
in
light
and
this
belongs
to
each
and
all
who
gaze
upon
the
witch
beheld
it
not
for
in
her
hand
she
held
a
woof
that
dimmed
the
burning
brand
this
lady
never
slept
but
lay
in
trance
all
night
within
the
fountain
as
in
sleep
its
emerald
crags
glowed
in
her
beauty
glance
through
the
green
splendour
of
the
water
deep
she
saw
the
constellations
reel
and
dance
like
and
withal
did
ever
keep
the
tenour
of
her
contemplations
calm
with
open
eyes
closed
feet
and
folded
palm
and
when
the
whirlwinds
and
the
clouds
descended
from
the
white
pinnacles
of
that
cold
hill
she
passed
at
dewfall
to
a
space
extended
where
in
a
lawn
of
flowering
asphodel
amid
a
wood
of
pines
and
cedars
blended
there
yawned
an
inextinguishable
well
of
crimson
fire
full
even
to
the
brim
and
overflowing
all
the
margin
trim
within
the
which
she
lay
when
the
fierce
war
of
wintry
winds
shook
that
innocuous
liquor
in
many
a
mimic
moon
and
bearded
star
woods
and
lawns
the
serpent
heard
it
flicker
in
sleep
and
dreaming
still
he
crept
afar
and
when
the
windless
snow
descended
thicker
than
autumn
leaves
she
watched
it
as
it
came
melt
on
the
surface
of
the
level
flame
she
had
a
boat
which
some
say
vulcan
wrought
for
venus
as
the
chariot
of
her
star
but
it
was
found
too
feeble
to
be
fraught
with
all
the
ardours
in
that
sphere
which
are
and
so
she
sold
it
and
apollo
bought
and
gave
it
to
this
daughter
from
a
car
changed
to
the
fairest
and
the
lightest
boat
which
ever
upon
mortal
stream
did
float
and
others
say
that
when
but
three
hours
old
the
love
out
of
his
cradle
lept
and
clove
dun
chaos
with
his
wings
of
gold
and
like
a
horticultural
adept
stole
a
strange
seed
and
wrapped
it
up
in
mould
and
sowed
it
in
his
mother
star
and
kept
watering
it
all
the
summer
with
sweet
dew
and
with
his
wings
fanning
it
as
it
grew
the
plant
grew
strong
and
green
the
snowy
flower
fell
and
the
long
and
fruit
began
to
turn
the
light
and
dew
by
inward
power
to
its
own
substance
woven
tracery
ran
of
light
firm
texture
ribbed
and
branching
the
solid
rind
like
a
leaf
veined
fan
of
which
love
scooped
this
boat
and
with
soft
motion
piloted
it
round
the
circumfluous
ocean
this
boat
she
moored
upon
her
fount
and
lit
a
living
spirit
within
all
its
frame
breathing
the
soul
of
swiftness
into
it
couched
on
the
fountain
like
a
panther
tame
one
of
the
twain
at
evan
feet
that
sit
or
as
on
vesta
sceptre
a
swift
flame
or
on
blind
homer
heart
a
winged
thought
in
joyous
expectation
lay
the
boat
then
by
strange
art
she
kneaded
fire
and
snow
together
tempering
the
repugnant
mass
with
liquid
love
all
things
together
grow
through
which
the
harmony
of
love
can
pass
and
a
fair
shape
out
of
her
hands
did
flow
a
living
image
which
did
far
surpass
in
beauty
that
bright
shape
of
vital
stone
which
drew
the
heart
out
of
pygmalion
a
sexless
thing
it
was
and
in
its
growth
it
seemed
to
have
developed
no
defect
of
either
sex
yet
all
the
grace
of
both
in
gentleness
and
strength
its
limbs
were
decked
the
bosom
swelled
lightly
with
its
full
youth
the
countenance
was
such
as
might
select
some
artist
that
his
skill
should
never
die
imaging
forth
such
perfect
purity
from
its
smooth
shoulders
hung
two
rapid
wings
fit
to
have
borne
it
to
the
seventh
sphere
tipped
with
the
speed
of
liquid
lightenings
dyed
in
the
ardours
of
the
atmosphere
she
led
her
creature
to
the
boiling
springs
where
the
light
boat
was
moored
and
said
here
and
pointed
to
the
prow
and
took
her
seat
beside
the
rudder
with
opposing
feet
and
down
the
streams
which
clove
those
mountains
vast
around
their
inland
islets
and
amid
the
forests
whose
shade
cast
darkness
and
odours
and
a
pleasure
hid
in
melancholy
gloom
the
pinnace
passed
by
many
a
pyramid
of
icy
crag
cleaving
the
purple
sky
and
caverns
yawning
round
unfathomably
the
silver
noon
into
that
winding
dell
with
slanted
gleam
athwart
the
forest
tops
tempered
like
golden
evening
feebly
fell
a
green
and
glowing
light
like
that
which
drops
from
folded
lilies
in
which
dwell
when
earth
over
her
face
night
mantle
wraps
between
the
severed
mountains
lay
on
high
over
the
stream
a
narrow
rift
of
sky
and
ever
as
she
went
the
image
lay
with
folded
wings
and
unawakened
eyes
and
its
gentle
countenance
did
play
the
busy
dreams
as
thick
as
summer
flies
chasing
the
rapid
smiles
that
would
not
stay
and
drinking
the
warm
tears
and
the
sweet
sighs
inhaling
which
with
busy
murmur
vain
they
had
aroused
from
that
full
heart
and
brain
and
ever
down
the
prone
vale
like
a
cloud
upon
a
stream
of
wind
the
pinnace
went
now
lingering
on
the
pools
in
which
abode
the
calm
and
darkness
of
the
deep
content
in
which
they
paused
now
the
shallow
road
of
white
and
dancing
waters
all
besprent
with
sand
and
polished
pebbles
mortal
boat
in
such
a
shallow
rapid
could
not
float
and
down
the
earthquaking
cataracts
which
shiver
their
waters
into
golden
air
or
under
chasms
unfathomable
ever
sepulchre
them
till
in
their
rage
they
tear
a
subterranean
portal
for
the
river
it
fled
the
circling
sunbows
did
upbear
its
fall
down
the
hoar
precipice
of
spray
lighting
it
far
upon
its
lampless
way
and
when
the
wizard
lady
would
ascend
the
labyrinths
of
some
vale
which
to
the
inmost
mountain
upward
tend
she
called
and
the
pale
and
heavy
hue
which
slumber
could
extend
over
its
lips
and
eyes
as
on
the
gale
a
rapid
shadow
from
a
slope
of
grass
into
the
darkness
of
the
stream
did
pass
and
it
unfurled
its
pinions
with
stars
of
fire
spotting
the
stream
below
and
from
above
into
the
sun
dominions
flinging
a
glory
like
the
golden
glow
in
which
spring
clothes
her
minions
all
interwoven
with
fine
feathery
snow
and
moonlight
splendour
of
intensest
rime
with
which
frost
paints
the
pines
in
winter
time
and
then
it
winnowed
the
elysian
air
which
ever
hung
about
that
lady
bright
with
its
aethereal
vans
and
speeding
there
like
a
star
up
the
torrent
of
the
night
or
a
swift
eagle
in
the
morning
glare
breasting
the
whirlwind
with
impetuous
flight
the
pinnace
oared
by
those
enchanted
wings
clove
the
fierce
streams
towards
their
upper
springs
the
water
flashed
like
sunlight
by
the
prow
of
a
meteor
flung
to
heaven
the
still
air
seemed
as
if
its
waves
did
flow
in
tempest
down
the
mountains
loosely
driven
the
lady
radiant
hair
streamed
to
and
fro
beneath
the
billows
having
vainly
striven
indignant
and
impetuous
roared
to
feel
the
swift
and
steady
motion
of
the
keel
or
when
the
weary
moon
was
in
the
wane
or
in
the
noon
of
interlunar
night
the
in
visions
could
not
chain
her
spirit
but
sailed
forth
under
the
light
of
shooting
stars
and
bade
extend
amain
its
wings
the
hermaphrodite
she
to
the
austral
waters
took
her
way
beyond
the
fabulous
thamondocana
where
like
a
meadow
which
no
scythe
has
shaven
which
rain
could
never
bend
or
shake
with
the
antarctic
constellations
paven
canopus
and
his
crew
lay
the
austral
lake
there
she
would
build
herself
a
windless
haven
out
of
the
clouds
whose
moving
turrets
make
the
bastions
of
the
storm
when
through
the
sky
the
spirits
of
the
tempest
thundered
by
a
haven
beneath
whose
translucent
floor
the
tremulous
stars
sparkled
unfathomably
and
around
which
the
solid
vapours
hoar
based
on
the
level
waters
to
the
sky
lifted
their
dreadful
crags
and
like
a
shore
of
wintry
mountains
inaccessibly
hemmed
in
with
rifts
and
precipices
gray
and
hanging
crags
many
a
cove
and
bay
and
whilst
the
outer
lake
beneath
the
lash
of
the
wind
scourge
foamed
like
a
wounded
thing
and
the
incessant
hail
with
stony
clash
ploughed
up
the
waters
and
the
flagging
wing
of
the
roused
cormorant
in
the
lightning
flash
looked
like
the
wreck
of
some
fragment
of
inky
this
haven
was
as
a
gem
to
copy
heaven
engraven
on
which
that
lady
played
her
many
pranks
circling
the
image
of
a
shooting
star
even
as
a
tiger
on
hydaspes
banks
outspeeds
the
antelopes
which
speediest
are
in
her
light
boat
and
many
quips
and
cranks
she
played
upon
the
water
till
the
car
of
the
late
moon
like
a
sick
matron
wan
to
journey
from
the
misty
east
began
and
then
she
called
out
of
the
hollow
turrets
of
those
high
clouds
white
golden
and
vermilion
the
armies
of
her
ministering
spirits
in
mighty
legions
million
after
million
they
came
each
troop
emblazoning
its
merits
on
meteor
flags
and
many
a
proud
pavilion
of
the
intertexture
of
the
atmosphere
they
pitched
upon
the
plain
of
the
calm
mere
they
framed
the
imperial
tent
of
their
great
queen
of
woven
exhalations
underlaid
with
lambent
as
may
be
seen
a
dome
of
thin
and
open
ivory
inlaid
with
crimson
silk
cressets
from
the
serene
hung
there
and
on
the
water
for
her
tread
a
tapestry
of
mist
was
strewn
dyed
in
the
beams
of
the
ascending
moon
and
on
a
throne
with
starlight
caught
upon
those
wandering
isles
of
aery
dew
which
highest
shoals
of
mountain
shipwreck
not
she
sate
and
heard
all
that
had
happened
new
between
the
earth
and
moon
since
they
had
brought
the
last
intelligence
and
now
she
grew
pale
as
that
moon
lost
in
the
watery
night
and
now
she
wept
and
now
she
laughed
outright
these
were
tame
pleasures
she
would
often
climb
the
steepest
ladder
of
the
crudded
rack
up
to
some
beaked
cape
of
cloud
sublime
and
like
arion
on
the
dolphin
back
ride
singing
through
the
shoreless
air
following
the
serpent
lightning
winding
track
she
ran
upon
the
platforms
of
the
wind
and
laughed
to
hear
the
roar
behind
and
sometimes
to
those
streams
of
upper
air
which
whirl
the
earth
in
its
diurnal
round
she
would
ascend
and
win
the
spirits
there
to
let
her
join
their
chorus
mortals
found
that
on
those
days
the
sky
was
calm
and
fair
and
mystic
snatches
of
harmonious
sound
wandered
upon
the
earth
she
passed
and
happy
thoughts
of
hope
too
sweet
to
last
but
her
choice
sport
was
in
the
hours
of
sleep
to
glide
adown
old
nilus
where
he
threads
egypt
and
aethiopia
from
the
steep
of
utmost
axume
until
he
spreads
like
a
calm
flock
of
sheep
his
waters
on
the
plain
and
crested
heads
of
cities
and
proud
temples
gleam
amid
and
many
a
pyramid
by
moeris
and
the
mareotid
lakes
strewn
with
faint
blooms
like
bridal
chamber
floors
where
naked
boys
bridling
tame
or
charioteering
ghastly
alligators
had
left
on
the
sweet
waters
mighty
wakes
of
those
huge
forms
within
the
brazen
doors
of
the
great
labyrinth
slept
both
boy
and
beast
tired
with
the
pomp
of
their
osirian
feast
and
where
within
the
surface
of
the
river
the
shadows
of
the
massy
temples
lie
and
never
are
erased
but
tremble
ever
like
things
which
every
cloud
can
doom
to
die
through
canals
and
wheresoever
the
works
of
man
pierced
that
serenest
sky
with
tombs
and
towers
and
fanes
was
her
delight
to
wander
in
the
shadow
of
the
night
with
motion
like
the
spirit
of
that
wind
whose
soft
step
deepens
slumber
her
light
feet
passed
through
the
peopled
haunts
of
humankind
scattering
sweet
visions
from
her
presence
sweet
through
fane
and
and
labyrinth
mined
with
many
a
dark
and
subterranean
street
under
the
nile
through
chambers
high
and
deep
she
passed
observing
mortals
in
their
sleep
a
pleasure
sweet
doubtless
it
was
to
see
mortals
subdued
in
all
the
shapes
of
sleep
here
lay
two
sister
twins
in
infancy
there
a
lone
youth
who
in
his
dreams
did
weep
within
two
lovers
linked
innocently
in
their
loose
locks
which
over
both
did
creep
like
ivy
from
one
stem
and
there
lay
calm
old
age
with
hair
and
folded
palm
but
other
troubled
forms
of
sleep
she
saw
not
to
be
mirrored
in
a
holy
song
distortions
foul
of
supernatural
awe
and
pale
imaginings
of
visioned
wrong
and
all
the
code
of
custom
lawless
law
written
upon
the
brows
of
old
and
young
said
the
wizard
maiden
the
strife
which
stirs
the
liquid
surface
of
man
life
and
little
did
the
sight
disturb
her
we
the
weak
mariners
of
that
wide
lake
its
shores
extend
or
billows
roll
our
course
unpiloted
and
starless
make
its
wild
surface
to
an
unknown
goal
but
she
in
the
calm
depths
her
way
could
take
where
in
bright
bowers
immortal
forms
abide
beneath
the
weltering
of
the
restless
tide
and
she
saw
princes
couched
under
the
glow
of
sunlike
gems
and
round
each
in
dormitories
ranged
row
after
row
she
saw
the
priests
asleep
all
of
one
sort
for
all
were
educated
to
be
the
peasants
in
their
huts
and
in
the
port
the
sailors
she
saw
cradled
on
the
waves
and
the
dead
lulled
within
their
dreamless
graves
and
all
the
forms
in
which
those
spirits
lay
were
to
her
sight
like
the
diaphanous
veils
in
which
those
sweet
ladies
oft
array
their
delicate
limbs
who
would
conceal
from
us
only
their
scorn
of
all
concealment
they
move
in
the
light
of
their
own
beauty
thus
but
these
and
all
now
lay
with
sleep
upon
them
and
little
thought
a
witch
was
looking
on
them
she
all
those
human
figures
breathing
there
beheld
as
living
spirits
to
her
eyes
the
naked
beauty
of
the
soul
lay
bare
and
often
through
a
rude
and
worn
disguise
she
saw
the
inner
form
most
bright
and
fair
and
then
she
had
a
charm
of
strange
device
which
murmured
on
mute
lips
with
tender
tone
could
make
that
spirit
mingle
with
her
own
alas
aurora
what
wouldst
thou
have
given
for
such
a
charm
when
tithon
became
gray
or
how
much
venus
of
thy
silver
heaven
wouldst
thou
have
yielded
ere
proserpina
had
half
oh
why
not
all
the
debt
forgiven
which
dear
adonis
had
been
doomed
to
pay
to
any
witch
who
would
have
taught
you
it
the
heliad
doth
not
know
its
value
yet
is
said
in
after
times
her
spirit
free
knew
what
love
was
and
felt
itself
alone
but
holy
dian
could
not
chaster
be
before
she
stooped
to
kiss
endymion
than
now
this
lady
like
a
sexless
bee
tasting
all
blossoms
and
confined
to
none
among
those
mortal
forms
the
passed
with
an
eye
serene
and
heart
unladen
to
those
she
saw
most
beautiful
she
gave
strange
panacea
in
a
crystal
bowl
they
drank
in
their
deep
sleep
of
that
sweet
wave
and
lived
thenceforward
as
if
some
control
mightier
than
life
were
in
them
and
the
grave
of
such
when
death
oppressed
the
weary
soul
was
as
a
green
and
overarching
bower
lit
by
the
gems
of
many
a
starry
flower
for
on
the
night
when
they
were
buried
she
restored
the
embalmers
ruining
and
shook
the
light
out
of
the
funeral
lamps
to
be
a
mimic
day
within
that
deathy
nook
and
she
unwound
the
woven
imagery
of
second
childhood
swaddling
bands
and
took
the
coffin
its
last
cradle
from
its
niche
and
threw
it
with
contempt
into
a
ditch
and
there
the
body
lay
age
after
age
mute
breathing
beating
warm
and
undecaying
like
one
asleep
in
a
green
hermitage
with
gentle
smiles
about
its
eyelids
playing
and
living
in
its
dreams
beyond
the
rage
of
death
or
life
while
they
were
still
arraying
in
liveries
ever
new
the
rapid
blind
and
fleeting
generations
of
mankind
and
she
would
write
strange
dreams
upon
the
brain
of
those
who
were
less
beautiful
and
make
all
harsh
and
crooked
purposes
more
vain
than
in
the
desert
is
the
serpent
wake
which
the
sand
covers
all
his
evil
gain
the
miser
in
such
dreams
would
rise
and
shake
into
a
beggar
lap
the
lying
scribe
would
his
own
lies
betray
without
a
bribe
the
priests
would
write
an
explanation
full
translating
hieroglyphics
into
greek
how
the
god
apis
really
was
a
bull
and
nothing
more
and
bid
the
herald
stick
the
same
against
the
temple
doors
and
pull
the
old
cant
down
they
licensed
all
to
speak
they
thought
of
hawks
and
cats
and
geese
by
pastoral
letters
to
each
diocese
the
king
would
dress
an
ape
up
in
his
crown
and
robes
and
seat
him
on
his
glorious
seat
and
on
the
right
hand
of
the
sunlike
throne
would
place
a
gaudy
to
repeat
the
chatterings
of
the
every
one
of
the
prone
courtiers
crawled
to
kiss
the
feet
of
their
great
emperor
when
the
morning
came
and
kissed
alas
how
many
kiss
the
same
the
soldiers
dreamed
that
they
were
blacksmiths
and
walked
out
of
quarters
in
somnambulism
round
the
red
anvils
you
might
see
them
stand
like
cyclopses
in
vulcan
sooty
abysm
beating
their
swords
to
ploughshares
in
a
band
the
gaolers
sent
those
of
the
liberal
schism
free
through
the
streets
of
memphis
much
i
wis
to
the
annoyance
of
king
amasis
and
timid
lovers
who
had
been
so
coy
they
hardly
knew
whether
they
loved
or
not
would
rise
out
of
their
rest
and
take
sweet
joy
to
the
fulfilment
of
their
inmost
thought
and
when
next
day
the
maiden
and
the
boy
met
one
another
both
like
sinners
caught
blushed
at
the
thing
which
each
believed
was
done
only
in
fancy
till
the
tenth
moon
shone
and
then
the
witch
would
let
them
take
no
ill
of
many
thousand
schemes
which
lovers
find
the
witch
found
one
and
so
they
took
their
fill
of
happiness
in
marriage
warm
and
kind
friends
who
by
practice
of
some
envious
skill
were
torn
apart
a
wide
wound
mind
from
mind
she
did
unite
again
with
visions
clear
of
deep
affection
and
of
truth
sincere
these
were
the
pranks
she
played
among
the
cities
of
mortal
men
and
what
she
did
to
sprites
and
gods
entangling
them
in
her
sweet
ditties
to
do
her
will
and
show
their
subtle
sleights
i
will
declare
another
time
for
it
is
a
tale
more
fit
for
the
weird
winter
nights
than
for
these
garish
summer
days
when
we
scarcely
believe
much
more
than
we
can
see
