notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors

what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

any

with
my

please
feel

is
a
iudgement
main
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confesse
perfection
so
could
erre
against
all
rules
of

and
must
be
driuen
to
find
out
practises
of
cunning
hell
why
this

therefore
vouch
againe
that

some
mixtures
powrefull

effect
he
wrought
vpon

this
is
no

more
wider

imminent
deadly
breach
of

taken
by

these
things
to

dispatch
come
againe

with
a
greedie
eare
deuoure
vp
my

which
i
obseruing
tooke
once
a
pliant
houre

found
good
meanes
to
draw
from

a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
instinctiuely
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
teares
when
i
did
speake
of
some
distressefull
stroke
that
my
youth
suffer
my
storie
being
done

borrow
these

why
thou
silly
gentleman
rod
it
is
sillynesse
to
liue
when
to
liue
is
torment
and
then
haue
we
a
prescription
to
dye
when
death
is
our
physition
iago
oh
villanous
i
haue
look
vpon
the
world
for
foure
times
seuen
yeares
and
since
i
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
iniurie
i
neuer
found
man
that
knew
how
to
loue
himselfe
ere
i
would
say
i
would
drowne
my
selfe
for
the
loue
of
a
gynney
hen
i
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboone
rod
what
should
i
do
i
confesse
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
vertue
to
amend
it
iago
vertue
a
figge
is
in
our
selues
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
our
bodies
are
our
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardiners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettels
or
sowe
lettice
set
hisope
and
weede
vp
time
supplie
it
with
one
gender
of
hearbes
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
haue
it
sterrill
with
idlenesse
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigeable
authoritie
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
if
the
braine
of
our
liues
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poize
another
of
sensualitie
the
blood
and
basenesse
of
our
natures
would
conduct
vs
to
most
prepostrous
conclusions
but
we
haue
reason
to
coole
our
raging
motions
our
carnall
stings
or
vnbitted
lusts
whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call
loue
to
be
a
sect
or
seyen
rod
it
can
not
be
iago
it
is
meerly
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
come
be
a
man
drowne
thy
selfe
drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
i
haue
profest
me
thy
friend
and
i
confesse
me
knit
to
thy
deseruing
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughnesse
i
could
neuer
better
steed
thee
then
now
put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
warres
defeate
thy
fauour
with
an
vsurp
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
can
not
be
long
that
desdemona
should
continue
her
loue
to
the
moore
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
in
her
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moores
are
changeable
in
their
wils
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
lushious
as
locusts
shalbe
to
him
shortly
as
bitter
as
coloquintida
she
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
errors
of
her
choice
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damne
thy
selfe
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
then
drowning
make

barbarian
and
venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the

therefore
make

a

of
drowning

to
manage
priuate
and
domesticke
quarrell
in

on

is
monstrous
iago
who
bega

thou

neere
i
had
rather
haue

cassio
yet
i
perswade
my

to
speake
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
this
it
is
generall
montano
and
my

being
in

there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for

and
cassio
following
him
with
determin
sword
to
execute
vpon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steppes
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
my
selfe
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
least
by
his
clamour
as
it
so
fell
out
the
towne
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foote
my
purpose
and
i
return
then
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clinke
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
to
night
i
nere
might
say
before
when
i
came
backe
for
this
was
briefe
i
found
them
close
together
at

and
thrust
euen
as
againe
they
were
when
you
your

did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
can
not
i
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
beleeue
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignitie
which
patience
could
not
passe
othe

is
cassio
in

then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my

then
kisse
me
hard
as
if
he
pluckt
vp

ring
nor
for

of

nor
for

nor

nor
any

for
all
the
whole

why
who
would
not
make
her
husband
a
cuckold
to
make
him
a
monarch
i
should
venture
purgatory
des
beshrew
me
if

for

aemil
why
the

a

hauing
the

is
a
wrong
in

you
might
quickly
make
it
right

there
is
any
such
woman
aemil
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
plaid

i
do
thinke
it
is
their

faults
if

that
they
slacke
their

and
powre
our

into

let

know
their

haue
sense
like
them
they
see
and

and
haue
their
palats
both
for
sweet
and
sowre
as
husbands
haue
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
vs
for

is
it
sport
i
thinke
it
is
and
doth

breed
it
i
thinke
it
doth
frailty
that
thus
erres
it
is
so
too
and
haue
not
we
