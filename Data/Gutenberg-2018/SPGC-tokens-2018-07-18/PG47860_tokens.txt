entitled
or
the
kick
in
the
days
of
who
was
among
the
wisest
and
most
glorious
of
the
commanders
of
the
faithful
there
resided
in
the
city
of
bagdad
an
elderly
merchant
of
such
enormous
wealth
that
his
lightest
expressions
of
opinion
caused
the
markets
of
the
euphrates
to
fluctuate
in
the
most
alarming
manner
this
merchant
whose
name
was
mahmoud
had
a
brother
in
the
middle
ranks
of
society
a
surgeon
by
profession
and
by
name
to
this
brother
he
had
frequently
expressed
a
fixed
determination
to
leave
him
no
wealth
of
any
kind
it
is
my
opinion
he
would
say
that
a
man
s
first
duty
is
to
his
own
children
and
though
i
have
no
children
myself
i
must
observe
the
general
he
was
fond
of
dilating
upon
this
subject
whenever
he
came
across
his
relative
and
would
discover
from
time
to
time
new
and
still
better
reasons
for
the
resolution
he
had
arrived
at
his
brother
received
with
great
courtesy
the
prospect
held
out
to
him
by
the
wealthy
merchant
but
one
day
finding
tedious
the
hundredth
repetition
of
that
person
s
pious
but
somewhat
wearisome
resolve
said
to
him
mahmoud
though
it
would
be
a
mean
and
even
an
impious
thing
to
expect
an
inheritance
from
you
to
any
of
my
seven
sons
yet
perhaps
you
will
allow
these
boys
to
receive
from
your
lips
some
hint
as
to
the
manner
in
which
you
have
accumulated
that
great
wealth
which
you
now
so
deservedly
by
all
means
said
mahmoud
who
was
ever
ready
to
describe
his
own
talents
and
success
send
the
little
fellows
round
to
me
about
the
hour
the
public
executions
take
place
before
the
palace
for
by
that
time
i
shall
have
breakfasted
and
shall
be
ready
to
receive
the
surgeon
with
profuse
thanks
left
his
brother
and
conveyed
the
good
news
to
the
seven
lads
who
stood
in
order
before
him
with
the
respect
for
parents
customary
in
the
orient
each
placed
according
to
his
size
and
running
in
gradation
from
eight
to
sixteen
years
of
age
upon
the
morrow
therefore
the
surgeon
s
seven
sons
seated
gravely
upon
crossed
legs
formed
a
at
the
feet
of
their
revered
relative
who
when
he
had
watched
them
humorously
and
in
silence
for
some
moments
puffing
at
his
great
pipe
opened
his
lips
and
spoke
as
follows
your
father
has
wondered
my
dear
nephews
in
what
way
the
fortune
i
enjoy
has
been
acquired
for
in
his
own
honourable
but
far
from
lucrative
walk
of
life
sums
which
are
to
me
but
daily
trifles
appear
like
the
ransoms
of
kings
to
you
his
numerous
family
it
seems
of
especial
advantage
that
the
road
to
riches
should
be
discovered
now
i
will
confess
to
you
my
dear
lads
that
i
am
quite
ignorant
of
any
rule
or
plan
whereby
the
perishable
goods
of
this
world
may
be
rapidly
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
faithful
nay
did
any
such
rule
exist
i
am
persuaded
that
by
this
time
the
knowledge
of
it
would
be
so
widely
diffused
as
to
embrace
the
whole
human
race
in
which
case
he
added
puffing
meditatively
at
his
pipe
all
would
cancel
out
and
no
result
would
be
achieved
since
a
great
fortune
as
i
need
not
inform
young
people
of
your
sagacity
is
hardly
to
be
acquired
save
at
the
expense
of
others
but
though
i
can
not
give
you
those
rules
for
which
your
father
was
seeking
when
he
sent
you
hither
i
can
detail
you
the
steps
by
which
my
present
affluence
was
achieved
and
each
of
you
according
to
his
intelligence
will
appreciate
what
sort
of
accidents
may
make
for
the
increase
of
fortune
when
you
are
possessed
of
this
knowledge
it
will
serve
you
through
life
for
recreation
and
amusement
though
i
very
much
doubt
its
making
you
any
richer
for
it
is
not
the
method
nor
even
the
opportunity
of
intelligent
acquisition
which
lead
to
great
riches
but
two
other
things
combined
one
the
unceasing
appetite
to
snatch
and
hold
from
all
and
at
every
season
the
other
that
profound
mystery
the
mercy
of
god
for
allah
in
his
inscrutable
choice
frowns
on
some
and
smiles
on
others
the
first
he
condemns
to
contempt
anxiety
duns
bills
courts
of
law
sudden
changes
of
residence
and
even
dungeons
the
second
he
gratifies
with
luxurious
vehicles
delicious
sherbet
and
enormous
houses
such
as
mine
his
will
be
done
a
dear
friend
of
mine
one
mashé
was
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
in
bosra
until
god
took
him
now
twenty
years
ago
he
left
two
sons
of
equal
intelligence
and
rapacity
the
one
after
numerous
degradations
died
of
starvation
in
armenia
the
other
of
no
greater
skill
is
governor
of
all
algeirah
and
rings
the
changes
at
will
upon
the
public
purse
for
a
moment
the
ancient
captain
of
industry
paused
with
bent
head
in
solemn
meditation
upon
the
designs
of
heaven
then
raising
his
features
protested
that
he
had
too
long
delayed
the
story
of
his
life
with
which
he
would
at
once
proceed
as
a
boy
my
dear
nephews
began
the
kindly
uncle
while
his
dutiful
nephews
regarded
him
with
round
eyes
i
was
shy
dirty
ignorant
lazy
and
wilful
my
parents
and
teachers
had
but
to
give
me
an
order
for
me
to
conceive
at
once
some
plan
of
disobeying
it
all
forms
of
activity
save
those
connected
with
dissipation
were
abhorrent
to
me
so
far
from
reciting
with
other
boys
of
my
age
in
chorus
and
without
fault
the
verses
of
the
koran
i
grew
up
completely
ignorant
of
that
work
the
most
solemn
name
in
which
i
to
this
day
pronounce
with
an
aspirate
from
an
unfamiliarity
with
its
aspect
upon
the
written
page
yet
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
never
neglected
my
religious
duties
that
i
prayed
with
fervour
and
regularity
and
that
i
had
a
singular
faith
in
the
loving
kindness
of
my
god
i
had
already
reached
my
seventeenth
year
when
my
father
who
had
carefully
watched
the
trend
of
my
nature
and
the
use
to
which
i
had
put
my
faculties
addressed
me
as
follows
mahmoud
i
wish
you
no
ill
i
have
so
far
fed
and
clothed
you
because
the
caliph
whom
allah
preserve
has
caused
those
who
neglect
their
younger
offspring
to
be
severely
beaten
upon
the
soles
of
their
feet
it
is
now
my
intention
to
send
you
about
your
business
i
propose
and
here
my
dear
father
pulled
out
a
small
purse
to
give
you
the
smallest
sum
compatible
with
my
own
interests
so
that
if
any
harm
befall
you
the
vigilant
officers
of
the
crown
can
not
ascribe
your
disaster
to
my
neglect
i
request
that
you
will
walk
in
any
direction
you
choose
so
only
that
it
be
in
a
straight
line
away
from
my
doors
if
when
this
your
patrimony
is
spent
you
make
away
with
yourself
i
shall
hold
you
to
blame
i
shall
be
better
pleased
to
hear
that
you
have
sold
yourself
into
slavery
or
in
some
other
way
provided
for
your
continued
sustenance
but
what
i
should
like
best
would
be
never
to
hear
of
you
with
those
words
my
father
your
grandfather
dear
boys
seizing
me
by
the
shoulders
turned
my
back
to
his
doors
and
thrust
me
forth
with
a
hearty
kick
the
better
to
emphasize
his
meaning
thus
was
i
launched
out
in
the
dawn
of
manhood
to
try
my
adventures
with
the
world
i
discovered
in
my
pouch
as
i
set
out
along
the
streets
of
the
city
the
sum
of
dinars
with
which
my
thoughtful
parent
had
provided
me
under
the
legal
compulsion
which
he
so
feelingly
described
with
so
large
a
capital
said
i
to
myself
i
can
exist
for
several
days
indulge
my
favourite
forms
of
dissipation
and
when
they
are
well
spent
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
some
experiment
whereby
to
replace
here
the
eldest
nephew
said
respectfully
and
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
pray
uncle
what
is
a
dinar
my
dear
lad
replied
the
merchant
with
a
merry
laugh
i
confess
that
to
a
man
of
my
position
a
reply
to
your
question
is
impossible
i
could
only
tell
you
that
it
is
a
coin
of
considerable
value
to
the
impoverished
but
to
men
like
myself
a
denomination
so
inferior
as
to
be
indistinguishable
from
all
other
having
so
expressed
himself
the
worthy
merchant
resumed
the
thread
of
his
tale
i
had
i
say
started
forward
in
high
spirits
to
the
sound
of
the
coins
jingling
in
my
pouch
when
my
steps
happened
to
take
to
the
where
i
found
a
ship
about
to
sail
for
the
persian
gulf
here
said
i
to
myself
is
an
excellent
opportunity
for
travelling
and
for
seeing
the
the
heat
of
the
day
was
rising
no
one
was
about
but
two
watermen
who
lay
dozing
upon
the
bank
i
nimbly
stepped
aboard
and
hid
myself
behind
one
of
the
bales
of
goods
with
which
the
deck
was
packed
when
the
sun
declined
and
work
was
resumed
the
sailors
tramped
aboard
the
sail
was
hoisted
and
we
started
upon
our
journey
befriended
by
the
darkness
of
night
i
crept
out
quietly
from
my
and
found
a
man
watching
over
the
prow
where
he
was
deputed
to
try
the
depth
of
the
water
from
time
to
time
with
a
long
pole
i
affected
an
air
of
authority
and
told
him
that
the
captain
had
sent
me
forward
to
deliver
his
commands
which
were
that
he
should
give
me
a
flask
of
wine
some
fruit
and
a
cake
for
i
guessed
that
like
all
sailors
he
had
in
his
possession
things
both
lawful
and
unlawful
these
i
told
him
i
would
take
to
my
relative
the
captain
he
left
me
with
the
pole
for
a
moment
and
soon
returned
with
the
provisions
with
which
i
crept
back
to
my
and
there
heartily
consumed
them
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
i
lay
sleeping
behind
the
bales
of
goods
with
the
fall
of
the
second
night
i
needed
a
second
meal
i
dared
not
repeat
my
first
experiment
and
lay
musing
till
hunger
having
sharpened
my
wits
i
hit
upon
a
plan
with
which
surely
providence
itself
must
have
inspired
a
poor
lonely
lad
thrown
in
his
unaided
weakness
upon
a
cruel
world
i
bethought
me
that
the
watchman
of
either
board
would
have
some
provision
for
the
night
i
remembered
a
sort
of
gangway
between
the
high
bales
upon
the
main
deck
which
corridor
led
back
far
under
the
poop
into
the
stern
sheets
it
has
been
so
designed
for
the
convenience
of
stowing
and
unloading
affording
a
passage
for
the
workmen
as
they
handled
the
cargo
i
put
these
two
things
together
in
my
mind
but
to
god
be
the
glory
and
formed
of
them
a
plan
for
immediate
execution
i
crept
from
my
and
sauntered
along
the
dark
deck
until
i
came
upon
the
watchman
squatting
by
the
rail
and
contemplating
the
stars
in
the
moonless
sky
he
had
as
i
had
suspected
a
platter
the
white
of
which
i
could
just
see
glimmering
against
the
deck
beside
him
i
thought
i
also
discerned
a
gourd
of
wine
i
approached
him
as
one
of
the
crew
for
they
were
chance
strangers
taken
on
at
the
wharf
we
talked
in
low
tones
of
the
girls
of
bagdad
of
the
police
of
opportunities
for
theft
and
of
such
other
topics
as
are
common
to
the
poor
till
naturally
we
came
to
wine
he
cursed
the
poor
quality
of
his
own
in
the
gourd
beside
him
i
after
some
mystery
confided
to
him
that
i
had
a
stock
of
excellent
wine
and
as
my
friendship
for
him
increased
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
told
him
it
was
in
the
stern
sheets
far
under
the
poop
deck
along
the
narrow
passage
between
the
high
bales
i
offered
to
go
with
him
and
fetch
it
allowing
him
in
his
eagerness
to
go
first
when
he
was
well
engaged
in
groping
aft
i
turned
crept
forward
again
silently
and
rapidly
picked
up
the
loaf
and
cheese
which
i
found
on
his
platter
as
also
the
gourd
and
vanished
into
my
i
ate
my
fill
though
somewhat
too
hurriedly
and
remarked
how
long
a
time
my
shipmate
was
spending
at
searching
that
empty
place
as
i
heard
him
creeping
back
at
last
cursing
violently
in
whispers
i
was
aware
of
faint
dawn
in
the
east
and
determined
that
my
cruise
must
end
we
were
already
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
as
i
discovered
by
tasting
the
water
over
the
side
in
the
darkness
and
discovering
it
to
be
brackish
i
bethought
me
that
my
poor
comrade
had
now
an
excellent
reason
for
ferretting
me
out
that
the
captain
also
would
soon
hear
of
me
and
that
with
daylight
i
should
certainly
be
visited
with
a
bastinado
or
put
into
chains
and
sold
i
therefore
slipped
over
the
side
for
i
was
an
excellent
swimmer
and
made
for
the
shore
there
i
lay
on
a
warm
beach
and
watched
through
the
reeds
the
great
sail
of
the
ship
as
it
slipped
further
and
further
away
in
the
growing
light
when
the
sun
rose
the
vessel
was
out
of
sight
and
looking
about
me
i
discovered
a
little
village
not
far
from
the
shore
inhabited
by
simple
fishermen
but
containing
several
houses
of
some
pretension
the
residences
of
wealthy
merchants
who
came
here
from
bosra
in
their
moments
of
leisure
to
relax
themselves
from
the
of
commerce
in
that
neighbouring
city
my
first
action
at
the
opening
of
the
new
day
was
to
fall
upon
my
knees
and
add
to
the
ritual
prayer
a
humble
outpouring
of
thanks
for
the
benefits
i
had
already
received
and
a
fervent
appeal
for
guidance
that
appeal
was
heard
i
rose
from
my
knees
full
of
a
plan
to
one
of
those
wealthier
houses
which
stood
near
the
village
i
at
once
proceeded
and
sent
in
a
message
by
a
slave
to
its
owner
saying
that
my
master
a
wealthy
dealer
in
carpets
solicited
the
custom
of
his
lordship
and
that
if
the
great
man
would
but
accompany
me
to
the
quay
i
would
there
show
him
wares
well
worthy
of
his
attention
it
so
happened
and
here
was
providence
again
at
work
that
this
merchant
had
a
passion
for
a
particular
sort
of
carpet
which
is
solely
made
by
the
inhabitants
of
el
kzar
for
they
alone
possess
the
secret
which
they
very
zealously
guard
the
slave
therefore
brought
me
back
the
message
that
his
master
would
not
be
at
the
pains
of
accompanying
me
unless
such
wares
were
present
for
his
inspection
if
my
carpets
were
those
of
el
kzar
he
would
willingly
inspect
them
but
if
they
were
of
any
other
brand
he
was
indifferent
and
let
this
teach
you
my
dear
nephews
how
simple
are
the
minds
of
the
rich
i
was
willing
enough
that
the
carpets
should
be
carpets
of
el
kzar
or
indeed
of
any
other
place
under
heaven
for
all
were
at
my
choice
i
hastened
therefore
to
send
back
a
further
message
that
by
a
curious
coincidence
we
had
upon
this
occasion
nothing
else
in
stock
but
kzaran
carpets
and
begged
the
slave
to
emphasize
this
important
point
to
his
master
his
reply
was
to
twist
his
right
hand
palm
upwards
with
a
strange
smile
i
pulled
out
my
purse
showed
him
the
shining
dinars
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
rather
have
now
for
his
fee
or
on
the
completion
of
the
transaction
with
glistening
eyes
and
even
as
i
thought
a
pathetic
gratitude
the
slave
leapt
at
the
latter
offer
and
let
this
teach
you
my
dear
nephews
how
simple
are
the
minds
of
the
poor
he
hastened
off
to
deliver
my
message
within
a
few
moments
the
master
of
the
house
appeared
in
great
haste
and
all
of
a
fever
bade
me
lead
him
to
the
appointed
at
this
moment
the
merchant
paused
and
with
reverie
and
reminiscence
in
his
eye
remained
silent
for
at
least
that
space
of
time
in
which
a
dexterous
may
gingerly
withdraw
a
purse
from
the
sleeve
of
a
holy
man
the
second
nephew
thought
the
opportunity
arrived
to
suggest
a
doubt
which
had
been
vexing
his
young
mind
he
said
with
an
obeisance
venerable
uncle
we
have
listened
to
the
beginnings
of
your
career
with
admiration
and
respect
but
we
are
more
perplexed
than
ever
to
discover
how
such
beginnings
could
have
led
to
such
an
end
for
you
appear
to
us
as
yet
only
to
have
followed
that
path
which
leads
to
the
torturers
and
the
such
replied
his
uncle
with
a
look
of
singular
affection
is
the
general
opinion
entertained
of
all
very
wealthy
men
in
the
first
steps
of
their
careers
but
i
hope
that
the
sequel
will
teach
you
and
your
clever
little
brothers
how
wrongly
informed
are
the
as
the
merchant
mahmoud
pronounced
these
words
the
call
to
prayer
was
heard
from
a
neighbouring
tower
and
he
hurriedly
concluded
my
dear
nephews
we
are
called
to
prayer
i
will
cease
here
to
speak
and
will
continue
the
story
of
myself
and
upon
hearing
these
words
his
seven
nephews
rose
together
and
crossed
their
arms
following
which
gesture
with
three
deep
bows
performed
as
they
walked
backwards
toward
the
curtains
of
the
magnificent
apartment
they
left
their
uncle
s
presence
you
will
remember
my
dear
nephews
said
the
merchant
mahmoud
when
the
lads
were
once
more
assembled
in
a
before
him
with
crossed
legs
and
attentive
countenances
that
you
left
me
hurrying
with
the
collector
of
kzaran
carpets
towards
the
quay
where
he
should
enjoy
the
sight
of
the
merchandise
this
merchant
was
reputed
among
the
people
of
the
place
to
be
of
a
singularly
cunning
and
secretive
temperament
a
character
which
you
may
think
it
strange
they
admired
as
though
it
were
the
summit
of
human
wisdom
i
confess
that
i
found
him
in
the
matter
of
kzaran
carpets
at
least
very
different
from
his
reputation
a
more
garrulous
old
gentleman
never
trod
this
earth
he
was
in
a
perpetual
stammer
of
excitement
and
though
i
was
careful
to
lead
him
by
the
most
roundabout
roads
that
he
might
have
time
to
cool
his
ardour
the
delay
did
but
seem
to
increase
it
i
implore
you
sir
he
said
at
last
as
one
who
could
no
longer
restrain
some
violent
passion
i
implore
you
pay
no
attention
to
others
in
this
place
who
may
have
attempted
to
forestall
me
in
the
matter
of
your
very
valuable
cargo
your
honour
is
i
know
sufficient
in
the
matter
i
am
confident
you
will
give
me
a
free
market
also
they
know
nothing
of
kzaran
carpets
in
these
parts
they
are
mere
buyers
and
sellers
and
on
what
a
margin
let
me
tell
you
in
your
ear
that
while
many
men
in
this
place
carry
on
the
appearance
of
riches
most
are
indebted
to
parsees
in
the
capital
i
alone
am
in
an
independent
position
and
here
he
whispered
i
can
well
reward
you
and
your
own
for
any
favour
you
may
show
seeing
him
so
eager
i
affected
a
certain
hesitation
and
embarrassment
and
at
last
confessed
that
i
had
been
approached
by
a
local
merchant
whose
name
i
was
forbidden
to
mention
and
who
had
very
kindly
sent
me
as
a
present
by
a
slave
the
sum
of
dinars
to
this
he
had
attached
no
conditions
but
he
had
also
quite
independently
sent
word
that
he
had
himself
orders
for
carpets
which
he
was
bound
to
fulfil
his
profit
he
had
said
if
i
would
give
him
a
first
choice
would
be
so
considerable
that
he
would
be
very
ready
to
offer
me
a
handsome
commission
on
the
completion
of
the
bargain
quite
apart
from
the
dinars
which
were
but
a
little
present
from
one
man
to
another
this
thousand
dinars
i
added
now
in
my
possession
i
have
accepted
a
present
is
a
graceful
act
and
can
be
taken
with
a
clean
conscience
but
the
is
another
matter
i
must
consider
beyond
everything
the
interests
of
my
master
i
shall
not
mention
the
offer
made
to
me
for
with
all
his
confidence
in
me
he
is
himself
a
business
man
and
might
misunderstand
my
position
but
i
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
give
him
no
advice
save
to
sell
to
the
highest
it
is
i
shouted
the
aged
connoisseur
eagerly
it
is
i
who
will
prove
the
highest
bidder
nay
my
dear
fellow
since
such
bargains
are
often
concluded
in
private
would
it
not
be
better
to
tell
your
master
forthwith
that
no
possible
competitor
can
stand
against
me
in
this
place
let
him
first
discover
the
sum
offered
by
my
rival
and
i
give
you
leave
to
suggest
a
sum
larger
by
which
shall
decide
his
judgment
meanwhile
he
added
two
thousand
dinars
are
but
a
small
present
for
one
in
your
position
and
i
shall
willingly
joyfully
propose
to
give
you
that
sum
not
for
a
moment
on
account
of
the
service
which
i
am
certain
you
design
to
do
me
but
purely
as
an
expression
of
my
his
excitement
had
now
so
risen
that
i
fear
his
judgment
was
lost
already
he
saw
before
him
in
his
mind
s
eye
a
pile
of
the
noblest
kzaran
carpets
all
ready
for
the
caravan
already
he
saw
a
rival
calmly
acquiring
them
on
the
distant
wharf
the
witnesses
placing
their
seals
the
words
of
completion
he
trembled
as
again
he
urged
on
me
the
little
gift
the
personal
gift
the
trifling
gift
of
dinars
sir
said
i
in
reply
a
little
stiffly
i
am
not
accustomed
to
take
secret
commissions
under
any
disguise
my
duty
is
clear
if
i
can
not
receive
a
firm
offer
superior
to
that
already
made
me
and
that
backed
with
proof
that
you
are
indeed
as
you
say
the
most
solid
man
in
the
place
then
i
must
close
with
my
first
client
if
indeed
i
were
certain
of
an
immediate
payment
in
a
larger
sum
i
would
accept
your
proposal
but
how
can
i
know
anything
of
this
place
the
thousand
dinars
of
which
i
spoke
are
coined
and
in
a
wallet
i
have
them
safe
with
all
the
respect
due
to
your
age
i
have
no
information
upon
your
credit
in
this
town
and
i
confess
i
added
in
another
tone
that
i
acquainted
with
your
rival
s
position
which
is
perhaps
more
solid
than
you
think
i
confess
i
think
it
would
be
simpler
and
to
the
better
interest
of
our
house
if
i
were
to
go
straight
to
him
now
and
have
done
with
as
i
spoke
thus
the
old
man
lost
all
reason
it
was
piteous
to
see
one
of
his
age
and
venerable
hairs
dancing
and
spluttering
with
excitement
he
shook
his
fists
in
the
air
he
called
to
heaven
in
shrill
tones
he
betrayed
all
the
frenzy
of
the
collector
he
contrasted
the
mercantile
motives
of
the
unknown
competitor
with
his
own
passion
for
pure
art
he
called
heaven
to
witness
to
the
reality
of
his
wealth
and
at
last
in
a
sort
of
fury
tore
from
his
garments
the
jewels
which
ornamented
them
thrust
into
my
hand
all
the
cash
upon
his
person
it
was
in
a
leather
bag
and
amounted
altogether
to
no
more
than
dinars
added
to
this
a
brooch
of
gold
which
he
dragged
from
his
scarf
and
said
that
if
this
instalment
were
not
a
sufficient
proof
of
his
good
faith
and
credit
he
knew
not
how
to
move
me
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
suggested
that
instead
of
making
so
violent
a
protestation
and
at
such
risk
to
his
fortune
he
should
go
back
soberly
to
his
house
and
return
with
an
instrument
of
credit
and
two
witnesses
as
the
law
demands
while
i
awaited
him
patiently
at
that
spot
i
at
least
was
in
no
haste
and
would
honourably
abide
his
return
he
was
off
at
a
speed
which
i
should
never
have
thought
possible
at
his
age
i
waited
until
he
had
turned
the
corner
of
a
distant
hedge
of
prickly
pears
and
not
until
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
did
i
gather
the
jewels
the
coins
and
the
precious
ornaments
which
in
his
haste
he
had
thrown
at
my
feet
and
very
rapidly
betake
myself
in
the
opposite
direction
never
was
the
mercy
of
allah
more
evidently
extended
the
plain
was
naked
outside
the
town
the
river
perhaps
a
mile
distant
my
plight
as
it
might
appear
desperate
i
pinned
the
gold
brooch
to
my
cloak
i
distributed
the
jewels
openly
upon
various
parts
of
my
person
and
i
proceeded
at
a
smart
pace
over
the
open
plain
towards
the
river
it
was
with
the
greatest
joy
that
i
found
upon
its
bank
two
fishermen
about
to
set
sail
and
proceed
to
sea
their
presence
inspired
me
with
a
plan
for
escape
i
chatted
negligently
with
them
still
keeping
one
eye
upon
the
distant
house
of
my
aged
but
excitable
friend
at
last
with
a
light
laugh
i
offered
one
of
them
a
piece
of
gold
saying
that
i
should
be
pleased
to
try
the
novel
experience
of
a
little
cruise
the
fisherman
who
was
quite
unacquainted
with
so
much
wealth
and
seemed
somewhat
awestruck
gave
me
some
grand
title
or
other
and
promised
me
very
good
sport
with
the
fish
and
a
novel
entertainment
but
even
as
he
and
his
companion
pushed
out
from
shore
i
turned
in
my
seat
on
the
deck
and
perceived
in
the
plain
a
rising
dust
which
betrayed
the
approach
of
the
merchant
with
his
witnesses
and
a
company
of
his
slaves
suddenly
changing
my
expression
from
one
of
pleased
though
wearied
expectancy
to
one
of
acute
alarm
i
shouted
to
my
new
companions
push
away
for
your
lives
and
stretch
your
sail
to
its
utmost
these
are
the
commissioners
sent
by
the
caliph
to
and
tax
all
upon
a
new
valuation
already
had
they
seized
three
upon
the
beach
when
i
left
and
found
you
here
at
these
words
the
worthy
fellows
were
inspired
by
a
fear
even
greater
than
my
own
they
manfully
pushed
into
the
swiftest
part
of
the
current
and
though
a
smart
breeze
was
blowing
hoisted
every
inch
of
the
sail
so
that
the
boat
ran
with
her
gunwale
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
water
and
was
indeed
dangerously
pressed
but
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
merchant
and
his
retinue
vainly
descending
the
at
perhaps
our
speed
calling
down
curses
upon
us
threatening
with
their
fists
shouting
their
public
titles
of
authority
their
menaces
of
the
law
and
in
every
way
confirming
my
excellent
pair
of
fishermen
in
the
story
i
had
told
them
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
loll
on
deck
under
the
heat
of
the
day
toying
with
the
valuable
ornaments
i
had
so
recently
acquired
and
lazily
watching
my
companions
as
they
sweated
at
the
halyards
or
alternatively
glancing
along
towards
the
shore
at
the
little
group
of
disappointed
people
which
fell
so
rapidly
behind
us
as
we
bowled
down
the
tide
soon
their
features
were
no
longer
plain
then
their
figures
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
the
last
impression
conveyed
to
me
was
of
some
little
very
distant
thing
stamping
with
impotent
rage
and
shaking
wild
arms
against
the
sky
i
could
not
but
deplore
so
grievous
a
lapse
in
dignity
in
one
so
venerable
when
we
were
well
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
i
asked
the
fishermen
whither
they
were
bound
to
which
they
answered
that
their
business
was
only
to
cruise
about
outside
and
fish
during
the
night
returning
at
dawn
with
their
catch
would
it
not
be
better
i
suggested
seeing
that
these
rapacious
fellows
will
hang
about
for
a
day
or
so
to
carry
me
to
some
town
of
your
acquaintance
along
the
coast
where
the
reigning
powers
do
not
suffer
from
the
tyranny
of
bagdad
for
my
part
i
am
free
to
travel
where
i
will
and
the
prospect
of
a
change
pleases
me
i
shall
be
happy
said
i
to
reward
the
sacrifice
of
your
catch
with
fifty
at
the
prospect
of
much
further
wealth
the
fishermen
were
at
once
convinced
they
sang
in
the
lightness
of
their
hearts
and
for
three
days
and
three
nights
we
sped
down
the
gulf
passing
bleak
mountains
and
deserted
rocky
promontories
until
upon
the
fourth
day
we
came
to
a
town
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
shall
we
land
here
said
i
no
said
the
fishermen
for
it
is
in
a
manner
within
the
caliph
s
dominions
and
perhaps
that
accursed
tax
of
which
you
spoke
will
be
levied
here
you
know
better
than
i
replied
i
thoughtfully
standing
for
a
moment
in
affected
perplexity
let
me
however
land
in
your
little
boat
i
have
a
passion
for
new
places
i
will
come
out
to
you
again
after
the
hour
of
the
prayers
while
you
stand
in
the
to
this
arrangement
they
readily
consented
i
rowed
to
the
land
and
when
i
had
reached
the
shore
i
was
pleased
to
see
my
fearful
hosts
quite
three
miles
out
upon
the
hot
and
shimmering
sea
gazing
at
them
i
hope
with
charity
and
certainly
with
interest
i
pushed
the
little
boat
adrift
for
i
had
no
reason
to
return
to
those
poor
people
and
made
my
way
inland
i
disposed
of
my
jewelery
at
prices
neither
low
nor
high
with
local
merchants
i
preserved
the
old
fellow
s
golden
brooch
which
i
imagined
for
i
am
a
trifle
weak
and
superstitious
might
bring
me
good
fortune
and
when
all
my
transactions
were
accomplished
i
counted
my
total
capital
and
found
myself
in
possession
of
no
less
than
dinars
the
cold
of
the
evening
had
come
by
the
time
my
accounts
were
settled
and
the
strings
of
my
pouch
were
drawn
i
set
myself
under
an
arbour
where
a
delicious
fountain
played
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
which
shone
over
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
drinking
some
local
beverage
the
name
of
which
i
knew
not
but
the
taste
and
effect
of
which
were
equally
pleasing
i
reflected
upon
my
increase
of
fortune
you
left
home
mahmoud
said
i
to
myself
with
one
hundred
dinars
of
which
your
excellent
and
careful
father
deprived
himself
rather
than
see
you
face
the
world
unarmed
or
himself
receive
the
bastinado
you
have
been
gone
from
home
a
week
you
are
perhaps
some
miles
from
your
native
city
your
capital
has
been
multiplied
and
so
far
you
may
look
with
an
eager
courage
towards
the
further
adventures
of
your
life
for
very
clearly
the
mercy
of
allah
is
upon
at
this
moment
a
nasal
hooting
from
the
neighbourhood
turret
warned
the
company
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
heaven
the
boys
who
had
sat
fascinated
by
their
uncle
s
recital
knew
that
the
end
of
their
entertainment
had
come
the
third
son
of
the
surgeon
was
therefore
impatient
to
exclaim
as
he
hurriedly
did
but
dear
uncle
though
we
see
that
a
certain
chance
favoured
you
and
not
only
your
native
talents
yet
we
do
not
perceive
how
all
this
led
to
any
main
road
to
my
boy
said
the
merchant
mahmoud
pensively
stroking
his
beard
and
gazing
vacuously
over
the
heads
of
the
youngsters
i
do
not
pretend
to
unfold
you
any
such
plan
have
i
not
told
you
that
did
such
a
plan
exist
all
would
be
in
possession
of
it
i
am
but
retailing
you
in
my
humble
fashion
the
steps
by
which
one
merchant
in
this
city
has
been
raised
by
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
merciful
his
named
be
adored
from
poverty
to
riches
but
the
call
for
prayer
has
already
been
heard
and
we
must
part
upon
this
same
day
of
next
week
shortly
after
the
last
of
the
public
executions
has
been
bungled
you
shall
again
come
and
hear
me
recite
the
next
chapter
of
my
varied
that
is
the
pearls
chapter
ii
entitled
or
the
pearls
a
week
later
at
the
hour
of
public
executions
and
beheadings
the
seven
boys
were
again
assembled
at
the
feet
of
their
revered
uncle
who
when
he
had
refreshed
them
with
cold
water
and
himself
with
a
curious
concoction
of
fermented
barley
addressed
them
as
follows
you
will
remember
my
lads
how
i
was
left
cut
off
from
my
dear
home
and
from
all
companions
in
a
strange
country
and
with
no
more
than
dinars
with
which
to
face
the
world
this
sum
may
seem
to
you
large
but
i
can
assure
you
that
to
the
operations
of
commerce
and
here
the
merchant
yawned
it
is
but
a
drop
in
the
ocean
and
i
had
already
so
far
advanced
during
one
brief
week
in
my
character
of
financier
that
i
gloomily
considered
how
small
a
sum
that
was
wherewith
to
meet
the
cunning
the
gluttony
and
the
avarice
of
this
great
world
but
a
brief
sleep
which
i
took
under
a
baobab
tree
to
save
the
cost
of
lodging
refreshed
at
once
my
body
and
my
intelligence
and
with
the
next
morning
i
was
ready
to
meet
the
here
the
merchant
coughed
slightly
and
addressing
his
nephews
said
you
have
doubtless
been
instructed
at
school
upon
the
nature
of
the
baobab
we
have
replied
his
nephews
and
they
recited
in
chorus
the
descriptions
which
they
had
been
taught
by
heart
from
the
of
their
academy
i
am
pleased
replied
their
uncle
smiling
to
discover
you
thus
informed
you
will
appreciate
how
ample
a
roof
this
singular
vegetable
affords
well
i
proceeded
under
the
morning
sun
through
a
pleasantly
wooded
and
rising
country
considering
by
what
contrivance
of
usury
or
deceit
i
might
next
increase
my
capital
when
i
saw
in
the
distance
the
groves
and
white
buildings
of
an
unwalled
town
to
which
since
large
places
especially
if
they
are
not
furnish
the
best
field
for
the
enterprise
of
a
captain
of
industry
i
proceeded
and
there
by
the
mercy
of
allah
there
befell
me
as
singular
an
adventure
as
perhaps
ever
has
fallen
to
the
lot
of
man
i
had
not
taken
up
my
place
in
the
local
caravanserai
for
more
than
an
hour
i
had
met
no
likely
fool
and
my
plans
for
the
future
were
still
vague
in
my
head
when
an
old
gentleman
of
great
dignity
followed
by
an
obsequious
officer
and
no
less
than
six
ethiopian
slaves
approached
me
with
deep
reverence
and
profferring
me
a
leathern
pouch
of
a
foreign
kind
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
before
asked
me
whether
i
were
not
the
young
man
who
had
inadvertently
left
it
upon
a
at
a
shrine
outside
the
city
i
seized
the
pouch
with
an
eager
air
held
it
up
in
transports
of
joy
and
kissing
it
again
and
again
said
oh
my
benefactor
how
can
i
sufficiently
thank
you
it
is
my
father
s
last
gift
to
me
and
is
all
my
viaticum
as
well
with
which
i
fell
to
kissing
and
fondling
it
again
pressing
it
to
my
heart
and
so
discovered
it
to
be
filled
with
coins
as
indeed
i
had
suspected
it
to
be
into
so
active
an
emotion
had
i
roused
myself
that
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
the
good
old
man
himself
was
greatly
affected
i
must
warn
you
young
stranger
he
said
paternally
against
this
thoughtlessness
so
common
in
youth
a
great
loss
indeed
had
it
been
for
you
if
we
had
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
recover
your
you
may
imagine
my
confusion
my
dear
nephews
at
finding
that
i
had
been
guilty
of
so
intolerable
a
fault
i
blushed
with
confusion
i
most
heartily
thanked
the
old
gentleman
not
for
his
integrity
which
it
would
have
been
insulting
to
mention
to
one
of
his
great
wealth
but
for
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
seek
out
a
careless
young
man
and
to
prevent
his
suffering
loss
nay
said
that
aged
gentleman
to
me
with
a
low
and
pleasant
laugh
you
must
not
thank
me
perhaps
had
i
myself
come
upon
the
treasure
i
might
have
thought
it
too
insignificant
to
restore
but
you
must
know
that
i
am
the
chief
magistrate
of
this
city
and
that
last
evening
my
officer
noticed
from
some
distance
a
young
man
apparently
a
stranger
to
this
city
whom
he
describes
as
of
your
height
and
features
rise
from
the
but
leave
behind
him
some
object
which
in
the
gathering
dusk
he
could
not
distinguish
on
his
approach
he
found
it
was
this
purse
of
yours
which
some
boys
had
already
found
and
were
quarrelling
over
when
he
took
it
from
them
he
brought
it
to
me
with
some
description
of
your
person
i
thought
you
might
well
be
at
this
caravanserai
and
brought
it
with
me
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
my
officer
who
now
accompanies
me
recognize
you
as
we
that
functionary
bowed
to
me
and
i
to
him
most
ceremoniously
and
as
i
did
so
i
was
rapidly
revolving
in
my
head
what
i
had
better
do
if
the
real
owner
should
appear
i
was
torn
between
two
plans
whether
to
denounce
him
as
a
thief
before
he
could
speak
or
to
run
off
at
top
speed
this
preoccupation
i
dismissed
lest
the
anxiety
of
it
should
appear
upon
my
face
i
again
thanked
this
good
old
man
most
warmly
and
we
entered
into
a
familiar
conversation
what
was
my
delight
at
the
close
of
it
when
he
bade
me
without
ceremony
accept
of
his
hospitality
and
come
home
to
take
a
meal
with
him
in
his
palace
i
was
eager
for
further
adventures
and
accompanied
him
with
the
greatest
joy
reclining
at
table
where
there
was
served
as
i
need
hardly
inform
my
dear
nephews
lamb
stuffed
with
pistachio
nuts
the
old
man
asked
me
whence
i
had
come
what
was
my
trade
and
whither
i
was
proceeding
i
answered
as
i
thought
prudently
that
i
had
come
from
aleppo
that
i
had
been
entrusted
by
my
father
with
the
sum
in
the
purse
he
had
so
kindly
restored
to
me
in
order
to
purchase
pearls
and
that
when
the
purchase
was
completed
i
had
instructions
to
sell
them
in
india
in
a
market
where
my
father
was
assured
that
pearls
were
rare
and
fetched
the
highest
prices
this
is
indeed
well
found
exclaimed
the
old
man
with
enthusiasm
i
am
myself
seeking
for
some
one
to
whom
i
may
sell
a
magnificent
collection
of
pearls
inherited
from
my
an
indian
begum
the
old
woman
he
added
nonchalantly
enough
was
a
miser
she
kept
the
drops
in
an
old
cedarwood
box
and
i
confess
myself
quite
ignorant
of
their
value
moreover
as
i
have
taken
a
liking
to
you
i
shall
let
you
fix
your
own
price
for
i
should
much
like
to
remember
when
my
time
comes
that
i
had
helped
a
friendless
man
in
his
first
step
to
fortune
only
i
am
a
little
ashamed
to
appear
to
be
making
money
out
of
an
heirloom
while
the
old
gentleman
so
spoke
i
was
rapidly
revolving
in
my
mind
what
motive
he
could
have
for
such
an
affection
of
indifference
to
wealth
when
i
recollected
that
he
was
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
and
immediately
concluded
that
these
pearls
being
the
property
of
local
people
and
obtained
by
him
for
nothing
by
way
of
bribes
and
other
legal
channels
he
would
both
desire
to
have
them
sold
at
a
distance
and
would
let
them
go
cheap
nay
continued
he
seeing
that
i
hesitated
as
these
thoughts
occurred
to
me
i
will
take
no
denial
for
me
it
is
but
a
mere
riddance
and
for
you
a
most
excellent
bargain
come
i
trust
your
honest
face
and
youthful
candour
you
shall
take
them
at
your
own
price
and
i
will
even
advise
you
of
the
city
of
india
where
you
will
find
your
best
put
thus
the
offer
i
will
confess
attracted
me
but
i
had
already
learned
the
wickedness
of
mankind
though
not
as
yet
i
am
glad
to
say
my
dear
nephews
at
my
own
expense
and
i
said
that
i
would
at
least
so
far
meet
him
as
to
take
the
jewels
to
a
local
merchant
invent
some
tale
as
though
they
were
my
own
and
see
what
sum
might
be
offered
for
them
only
when
i
thus
had
some
measure
of
their
value
could
i
honourably
make
an
offer
i
continued
at
some
length
in
this
strain
expressing
a
humble
inability
to
judge
and
the
fear
lest
my
capital
might
not
be
sufficient
which
he
i
stipulated
for
a
reason
you
will
soon
perceive
that
a
slave
of
his
should
accompany
me
if
only
as
a
matter
of
routine
for
said
i
i
was
very
jealous
of
my
honour
he
agreed
though
he
was
good
enough
to
call
it
a
pure
formality
i
left
the
aged
magistrate
with
many
thanks
and
accompanied
by
the
slave
proceeded
with
the
pearls
to
the
jewel
merchants
quarter
in
the
bazaar
i
stopped
before
one
of
the
richest
and
most
reputed
booths
and
spreading
the
pearls
before
the
merchant
told
him
that
i
was
compelled
to
sell
these
under
order
from
authority
as
the
end
of
a
family
dispute
to
pay
the
dowry
of
my
sister
that
i
therefore
was
in
haste
to
settle
and
would
take
the
least
price
he
might
choose
to
mention
within
reason
i
was
said
i
wholly
in
his
hands
it
was
urgent
for
me
that
the
bargain
should
be
quickly
completed
but
before
i
could
receive
his
cash
i
must
hear
the
lowest
figure
he
would
name
while
i
thus
spoke
the
slave
stood
respectfully
behind
me
and
listened
to
our
conversation
the
jewel
merchant
said
that
no
class
of
merchandise
was
more
distasteful
to
him
than
pearls
there
was
at
this
moment
no
market
for
them
it
was
impossible
to
purchase
them
save
properly
set
and
in
regular
sizes
and
finally
it
was
well
known
that
pearls
were
the
most
unlucky
of
gems
it
was
quite
impossible
for
him
to
offer
more
than
dinars
and
even
so
he
would
doubtless
be
the
loser
by
the
transaction
when
i
heard
this
i
rapidly
wrote
upon
a
slip
of
paper
the
following
words
my
lord
the
chief
merchant
in
this
city
estimates
your
jewels
at
dinars
i
can
not
alas
provide
that
sum
and
therefore
i
can
not
honestly
make
an
offer
myself
as
i
had
hoped
if
you
desire
to
have
them
sold
here
i
will
faithfully
execute
your
commission
but
if
you
prefer
that
i
should
return
them
to
you
send
me
word
meanwhile
i
will
still
bargain
here
awaiting
your
i
sent
this
note
by
the
slave
and
begged
him
to
give
it
to
his
master
and
to
bring
me
an
answer
the
slave
went
off
and
when
i
judged
him
to
be
well
out
of
hearing
i
turned
and
said
to
the
merchant
sighing
well
since
you
offer
no
more
i
must
take
what
you
offer
the
slave
whom
you
saw
me
despatch
carried
the
news
to
my
family
i
burn
when
i
think
of
how
their
scorn
will
mock
my
humiliation
i
therefore
said
nothing
true
of
the
price
indeed
i
have
set
it
down
in
that
note
as
something
much
higher
but
i
submit
for
as
i
told
you
i
am
pressed
come
count
me
the
money
and
i
will
the
merchant
after
i
had
handed
over
the
pearls
counted
me
the
money
into
yet
another
large
leathern
bag
which
i
shouldered
and
with
rapid
steps
bore
out
of
the
bazaar
and
soon
out
of
the
town
itself
by
a
gate
called
the
that
is
the
gate
of
innocence
beyond
the
town
walls
was
a
long
roll
of
dusty
sloping
land
set
here
and
there
with
dusty
stunted
bushes
and
having
beyond
it
a
high
range
of
desert
hills
a
track
led
roughly
rising
across
it
away
from
the
town
i
followed
this
track
for
one
hour
and
then
sat
down
for
my
new
fortune
was
heavy
and
rested
as
i
thought
it
probable
that
my
good
old
friend
himself
would
return
speedily
with
his
slave
to
the
bazaar
and
as
the
complication
of
the
affair
might
embroil
me
i
hid
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
squeezed
in
a
jackal
s
earth
beneath
a
bank
before
nightfall
i
ventured
out
and
gazed
about
me
leaving
my
original
pouch
my
windfall
and
my
big
leathern
bag
of
dinars
in
the
jackal
s
earth
while
i
surveyed
the
track
it
was
the
hour
i
love
above
all
others
the
sun
had
just
set
beyond
the
distant
ocean
towards
which
my
face
was
turned
and
between
me
and
which
upon
the
plain
below
for
i
had
come
to
the
rise
of
the
mountain
side
lay
the
beautiful
city
i
had
just
left
the
fragrant
smoke
of
cedarwood
rose
from
some
of
its
roofs
as
the
evening
fell
there
was
still
hanging
in
the
air
the
coloured
dust
of
evening
above
the
roads
of
entry
and
there
came
faintly
through
the
distance
the
cry
of
the
muezzin
i
was
not
so
entranced
by
the
natural
beauty
of
the
scene
as
to
neglect
the
duty
which
this
sound
recalled
i
fell
immediately
upon
my
knees
and
was
careful
to
add
to
the
accustomed
prayers
of
that
hour
my
thanks
for
the
guidance
and
the
grace
which
had
so
singularly
increased
my
fortunes
in
the
last
few
hours
as
i
rose
from
these
devotions
i
heard
upon
my
right
a
low
wailing
sound
and
was
astonished
to
discover
there
seated
hopelessly
beneath
a
small
shrub
and
waving
his
hands
in
grief
a
young
man
of
much
my
own
height
and
appearance
but
i
flatter
myself
that
not
even
in
my
most
careful
assumptions
of
innocence
have
i
ever
worn
such
a
booby
face
he
was
swaying
slowly
from
side
to
side
and
as
he
did
so
moaning
a
ceaseless
plaint
the
words
of
which
i
caught
and
which
touched
me
to
the
heart
over
and
over
again
he
recited
his
irreparable
loss
he
had
but
that
small
sum
it
was
his
patrimony
his
sole
security
how
should
he
answer
for
it
who
should
now
support
him
or
what
should
he
do
so
he
wailed
to
himself
in
miserable
monotone
till
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
for
i
saw
that
i
had
by
a
singular
coincidence
come
upon
that
poor
young
man
whose
pouch
i
had
been
given
in
error
by
the
magistrate
of
the
city
i
bowed
before
him
he
noticed
me
listlessly
enough
and
asked
me
what
i
would
i
told
him
i
thought
i
could
give
him
comfort
was
it
not
he
said
i
who
had
left
a
certain
pouch
i
carefully
described
it
containing
sundry
coins
upon
a
outside
the
city
at
this
very
same
sunset
hour
of
the
day
before
his
despair
was
succeeded
by
a
startling
eagerness
he
leapt
to
his
feet
seized
my
arm
rose
feverishly
and
implored
me
to
tell
him
further
alas
i
said
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
but
little
i
fear
to
raise
your
hopes
too
high
but
at
any
rate
i
can
put
you
upon
the
track
of
your
sir
said
he
resuming
his
hopeless
tone
for
a
moment
i
have
already
done
my
best
i
went
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
to
claim
it
and
was
met
by
an
officer
of
his
who
told
me
that
the
purse
had
already
been
delivered
to
its
owner
suspected
my
claim
and
bade
me
return
but
how
shall
i
prove
that
it
is
mine
or
how
indeed
receive
it
since
the
abominable
thief
who
took
possession
of
it
must
by
now
be
already
far
away
you
do
him
an
injustice
said
i
it
is
precisely
of
him
whom
you
uncharitably
call
a
thief
that
i
would
speak
to
you
you
think
that
he
is
far
away
whereas
he
is
really
at
your
hand
whenever
you
choose
to
act
for
this
is
the
message
that
i
bring
you
he
awaits
you
even
now
and
if
you
will
present
yourself
to
him
he
will
restore
your
how
can
you
know
this
said
the
young
man
gazing
at
me
doubtfully
by
what
coincidence
have
you
any
knowledge
of
the
affair
it
is
simple
enough
said
i
this
person
to
whom
your
purse
was
given
and
i
were
in
the
same
inn
we
fell
to
talking
of
our
adventures
along
the
road
for
he
also
was
a
stranger
and
he
told
me
the
singular
tale
how
he
had
recovered
from
the
authorities
a
purse
which
he
honestly
thought
his
own
for
it
was
very
like
one
which
he
himself
possessed
but
that
on
finding
his
own
purse
later
on
in
his
wallet
he
was
overwhelmed
with
regret
at
the
thought
of
the
loss
he
had
occasioned
at
the
same
time
he
made
me
his
confidant
telling
me
that
he
intended
to
restore
it
this
very
evening
at
sunset
to
the
authorities
and
that
any
one
claiming
it
after
that
hour
and
proving
it
was
his
could
recover
it
at
the
public
offices
but
he
warned
me
of
one
thing
the
officers
he
told
me
were
convinced
from
what
indication
i
know
not
perhaps
from
the
presence
of
something
in
the
purse
or
perhaps
from
something
they
had
heard
that
the
owner
dealt
in
here
the
young
man
interrupted
me
and
assured
me
he
had
never
bought
or
sold
pearls
in
his
life
nor
thought
of
doing
so
i
answered
that
no
doubt
this
was
so
but
that
when
the
authorities
had
a
whim
it
was
well
to
humour
them
he
would
therefore
do
well
to
approach
the
officer
who
guarded
the
gate
of
the
chief
magistrate
s
house
with
the
simple
words
i
am
the
seller
of
pearls
on
hearing
which
his
path
would
be
made
smooth
for
him
and
he
would
receive
his
belongings
the
young
man
thanked
me
heartily
he
even
warmly
embraced
me
for
the
good
news
i
had
given
him
and
felt
i
fear
that
his
purse
and
his
small
fortune
were
already
restored
to
him
it
was
a
gallant
sight
to
see
him
in
the
last
of
the
light
swinging
down
the
mountain
side
with
a
new
life
in
him
and
i
sincerely
regretted
from
my
heart
the
necessity
under
which
i
was
to
imperil
his
liberty
and
life
but
you
will
agree
with
me
my
dear
nephews
that
i
could
not
possibly
afford
to
have
him
at
large
when
he
had
gone
and
when
it
was
fully
night
there
being
no
moon
and
only
the
stars
in
the
warm
dark
sky
i
rapidly
took
my
burdens
from
their
and
proceeded
though
with
some
difficulty
up
the
mountain
side
staggering
under
such
a
weight
and
deviating
from
the
track
so
that
there
should
be
less
chance
of
finding
myself
interrupted
i
slept
for
a
few
hours
i
awoke
at
dawn
i
counted
my
total
fortune
and
found
that
it
was
just
about
dinars
the
most
of
it
in
silver
carefully
concealing
it
again
i
left
its
and
glided
round
the
mountain
until
i
came
to
a
place
where
a
new
track
began
to
appear
which
led
to
a
neighbouring
village
here
i
bought
an
ass
and
returning
with
it
to
my
and
setting
my
treasure
upon
it
i
went
off
at
random
to
spend
the
day
in
travelling
as
rapidly
as
i
might
away
from
the
neighbourhood
by
the
most
deserted
regions
i
came
a
little
before
sunset
upon
a
hermit
s
cave
where
i
was
hospitably
entertained
and
the
tenant
of
which
refused
all
reward
asking
me
only
to
pray
for
him
as
he
was
certain
that
the
prayers
of
youth
and
innocence
would
merit
him
a
high
place
in
heaven
with
this
holy
man
i
remained
for
some
four
or
five
days
passing
my
time
at
leisure
in
his
retreat
among
the
mountains
and
feeding
my
donkey
upon
the
dried
grasses
which
i
brought
in
by
armfuls
at
dusk
from
the
woodlands
upon
the
fifth
day
of
this
concealment
the
hermit
came
in
pensive
and
sad
and
said
to
me
my
son
with
every
day
the
wickedness
of
this
world
increases
and
the
judgment
of
god
will
surely
fall
upon
it
in
a
devastating
fire
i
have
but
just
heard
that
the
chief
magistrate
of
our
capital
city
using
as
a
dupe
an
innocent
stranger
sold
to
one
of
the
great
jewellers
of
the
place
for
no
less
than
dinars
a
quantity
of
pearls
every
one
of
which
now
turns
out
to
be
false
and
valueless
nay
i
am
told
that
the
largest
are
made
of
nothing
but
wax
and
what
is
worse
not
content
with
this
first
wickedness
the
magistrate
under
the
plea
that
the
young
stranger
had
disappeared
confiscated
the
gems
again
and
had
the
poor
merchant
most
severely
beaten
but
worse
and
worse
the
poor
youth
having
innocently
returned
that
very
night
to
the
city
was
seized
by
the
guard
and
beheaded
ya
ya
said
the
good
old
man
throwing
up
his
hands
the
days
increase
and
their
evil
increases
with
them
at
this
moment
the
hoarse
and
discordant
voice
of
the
public
crier
croaked
its
first
note
from
the
neighbouring
turret
and
the
nephews
who
had
sat
enraptured
at
their
uncle
s
tale
knew
that
it
was
time
to
disperse
the
eldest
brother
therefore
said
o
uncle
before
we
go
let
me
express
the
thanks
of
all
of
us
for
your
enrapturing
story
but
let
me
also
express
our
bewilderment
at
the
absence
of
all
plan
in
your
singular
adventures
for
though
we
have
listened
minutely
to
all
you
have
said
we
can
not
discover
what
art
you
showed
in
the
achievement
of
any
purpose
for
instance
how
could
you
know
that
the
pearls
were
false
i
did
not
know
it
my
dear
nephew
replied
the
great
merchant
with
beautiful
simplicity
and
the
whole
was
the
mercy
of
allah
but
come
the
hour
of
prayer
is
announced
and
we
must
following
the
invariable
custom
of
the
faithful
make
yet
another
joint
in
my
singular
tale
come
therefore
on
this
day
week
shortly
after
the
last
of
the
public
executions
of
the
vulgar
and
i
will
tell
you
of
my
further
fortunes
for
you
must
understand
that
the
dinars
of
which
my
story
now
leaves
me
possessed
are
and
here
the
honest
old
man
yawned
again
and
waved
his
hand
but
a
to
a
man
like
his
seven
little
nephews
bowed
repeatedly
and
walking
backwards
without
a
trip
disappeared
through
the
costly
tapestries
of
their
uncle
s
apartments
الطواجن
that
is
the
pipkins
chapter
iii
entitled
or
the
pipkins
on
the
appointed
day
of
the
next
week
when
with
the
hour
of
public
executions
the
amusements
of
the
city
come
to
an
end
and
the
citizens
betake
themselves
to
the
early
afternoon
s
repose
the
seven
boys
were
once
more
seated
in
the
presence
of
their
uncle
whom
they
discovered
in
a
radiant
humour
he
welcomed
them
so
warmly
that
they
imagined
for
a
moment
he
might
be
upon
the
point
of
offering
them
sherbet
sweetmeats
or
even
money
they
were
undeceived
however
when
the
excellent
but
extremely
wealthy
old
man
drawing
his
purse
lovingly
through
his
fingers
ordered
to
have
poured
out
for
each
of
them
by
a
slave
a
further
draught
of
delicious
cold
water
put
himself
at
his
ease
for
a
long
story
and
resumed
his
tale
you
will
remember
my
delightful
nephews
he
said
how
i
found
myself
in
the
hermit
s
hut
without
a
friend
in
the
world
and
with
a
capital
of
no
more
than
twelve
thousand
dinars
which
i
had
carried
thither
in
a
sack
upon
indeed
it
was
entirely
due
to
the
mercy
of
allah
that
my
small
capital
was
even
as
large
as
it
was
for
had
the
merchant
in
the
bazaar
discovered
the
pearls
to
be
false
he
would
not
only
have
offered
me
far
less
but
might
possibly
after
having
disposed
of
the
pearls
have
given
me
over
to
the
police
as
it
was
heaven
had
been
kind
to
me
though
not
bountiful
and
i
still
had
to
bethink
me
what
to
do
next
if
i
desired
to
increase
my
little
treasure
taking
leave
therefore
of
the
good
hermit
i
pressed
into
his
hand
a
small
brass
coin
the
superscription
of
which
was
unknown
to
me
and
which
i
therefore
feared
i
might
have
some
difficulty
in
passing
i
assured
my
kind
host
that
it
was
a
coin
of
the
second
caliph
omar
and
of
value
very
far
superior
to
any
modern
gold
piece
of
a
similar
size
as
the
hermit
like
many
other
saintly
men
was
ignorant
of
letters
his
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
he
dismissed
me
with
a
blessing
so
long
and
complicated
that
i
can
not
but
ascribe
to
it
some
part
of
the
good
fortune
which
next
befell
me
for
you
must
know
that
when
after
laying
in
stores
at
a
neighbouring
village
i
had
driven
my
donkey
forward
for
nearly
a
week
over
barren
and
uninhabited
mountains
and
when
i
had
nearly
exhausted
my
provision
of
dried
cakes
and
wine
a
beverage
which
our
religion
allows
us
to
consume
when
no
one
is
by
i
was
delighted
to
come
upon
a
fertile
valley
entirely
closed
in
by
high
precipitous
cliffs
save
at
one
issue
where
a
rough
track
led
from
this
enchanted
region
to
the
outer
world
in
this
valley
i
discovered
to
my
astonishment
manners
to
be
so
primitive
or
intelligence
so
low
that
the
whole
art
of
was
ignored
by
the
inhabitants
and
by
the
very
governors
themselves
the
king
who
i
am
glad
to
say
was
of
the
faithful
had
indeed
promulgated
laws
against
certain
forms
of
fraud
which
he
imagined
to
be
denounced
in
the
koran
but
these
were
of
so
infantile
a
character
that
a
man
of
judgment
could
very
easily
avoid
them
in
any
plans
he
might
frame
for
the
people
s
betterment
and
his
own
the
population
consisted
entirely
of
soldiers
and
rustics
among
all
of
whom
not
one
could
be
discovered
capable
of
calculating
with
justice
a
compound
interest
for
ten
years
under
these
circumstances
my
only
difficulty
lay
in
choosing
what
form
my
first
enterprise
should
take
after
a
little
thought
i
decided
that
what
we
call
in
bagdad
an
amalgamation
of
competing
interests
would
be
no
bad
beginning
i
began
with
due
caution
by
investing
a
couple
of
thousand
dinars
in
the
merchandise
of
a
potter
who
had
recently
died
and
whose
widow
needed
ready
cash
to
satisfy
the
sacred
demands
of
the
dead
she
spent
the
money
in
the
ornamentation
of
his
tomb
with
which
unproductive
expenditure
the
foolish
woman
was
in
no
small
degree
here
the
eldest
of
the
nephews
interrupted
mahmoud
to
ask
most
respectfully
why
with
a
capital
of
twelve
thousand
dinars
he
had
used
but
two
and
why
he
had
begun
his
experiment
upon
the
petty
business
of
a
poor
widow
my
son
said
his
uncle
affectionately
you
do
well
to
ask
these
questions
they
show
a
reasoned
interest
in
the
great
art
of
getting
well
then
as
to
the
smallness
of
my
beginning
it
was
i
hope
due
to
humility
for
ostentation
is
hateful
but
a
good
deed
is
never
thrown
away
and
how
useful
i
found
this
reserve
of
ten
thousand
dinars
which
i
had
in
my
meekness
kept
aside
you
shall
soon
learn
as
to
why
i
began
operations
in
the
kiln
of
this
poor
widow
it
was
because
i
have
ever
loved
the
little
ones
of
this
world
and
aided
them
to
my
best
endeavour
this
charitable
action
also
turned
out
to
be
wise
as
such
actions
often
do
for
i
could
thus
proceed
at
first
unnoticed
and
begin
my
new
adventures
without
exciting
any
embarrassing
attention
i
continued
to
live
in
the
same
small
hut
i
had
hired
on
my
arrival
under
the
floor
of
which
i
kept
my
modest
capital
and
i
put
it
about
as
modesty
demanded
that
i
was
almost
destitute
as
it
was
indifferent
to
me
for
the
moment
whether
i
obtained
a
return
upon
this
paltry
investment
or
no
i
was
able
to
sell
my
wares
at
very
much
the
same
sum
as
they
had
cost
me
and
as
i
had
bought
the
whole
stock
cheap
that
sum
was
less
than
the
cost
of
manufacture
there
was
a
considerable
store
of
pipkins
in
the
old
sheds
and
while
i
sold
them
off
at
charitable
rates
very
disconcerting
to
other
merchants
i
had
time
to
consider
my
next
step
upon
this
next
step
i
soon
determined
when
with
due
delay
my
original
stock
of
pipkins
had
been
sold
i
purchased
a
small
consignment
of
clay
i
relit
the
fires
in
the
kiln
i
hired
a
couple
of
starving
potters
and
i
began
to
manufacture
the
fame
of
my
very
cheap
pipkins
had
spread
as
was
but
natural
and
secured
me
an
increasing
number
of
customers
for
my
newly
made
wares
but
i
thought
it
wrong
to
debauch
the
peasants
by
selling
them
their
pots
under
cost
price
any
longer
i
was
constrained
by
the
plainest
rule
of
duty
to
raise
my
prices
to
the
cost
of
manufacture
though
no
more
keeping
justice
as
my
guiding
star
for
depend
upon
it
my
dear
nephews
in
business
as
in
every
other
walk
of
life
an
exact
rectitude
alone
can
lead
us
to
the
most
dazzling
rewards
this
price
of
mine
was
still
lower
than
that
of
all
the
other
who
had
been
accustomed
from
immemorial
time
to
the
base
idea
of
profit
and
were
in
a
perpetual
surmise
what
secret
powers
i
had
to
permit
me
such
quotations
but
i
made
no
mystery
of
the
affair
i
allowed
all
my
friends
to
visit
my
simple
factory
and
i
explained
to
their
satisfaction
how
organization
and
a
close
attention
to
costings
were
sufficient
to
account
for
my
prosperity
still
as
my
sales
continued
to
grow
new
doubts
arose
and
with
them
i
am
glad
to
say
new
respect
for
my
skill
in
affairs
the
simple
folk
wondered
by
what
art
i
had
contrived
so
difficult
a
financial
operation
but
as
it
was
traditional
among
them
that
one
who
sold
goods
cheap
was
a
benefactor
to
the
community
my
action
was
lauded
my
fame
spread
and
the
number
of
my
customers
continually
increased
you
will
not
be
slow
to
perceive
my
dear
boys
that
my
competitors
in
the
bazaar
being
compelled
to
compete
with
my
ruinous
prices
were
all
embarrassed
and
that
the
less
attentive
or
privileged
soon
began
to
fall
into
financial
difficulties
the
first
of
course
being
those
who
were
the
most
renowned
among
these
simpletons
for
their
cunning
their
silence
their
lying
and
their
commercial
skill
in
general
these
as
they
were
perpetually
trying
new
combinations
to
discover
or
to
defeat
my
supposed
schemes
were
an
easy
prey
even
the
straightforward
fellows
who
knew
of
no
art
more
subtle
than
the
charging
of
ten
per
cent
above
cost
price
and
who
did
not
play
into
my
hands
by
any
wearisome
financial
strategy
began
to
be
roped
into
my
net
as
the
area
of
my
operations
spread
for
when
i
had
acquired
at
a
calculated
loss
a
good
half
of
the
pottery
business
in
this
sequestered
paradise
i
could
by
what
is
known
as
the
fluctuation
of
the
market
but
i
will
not
confuse
you
with
technical
terms
put
my
remaining
competitors
into
alternate
fevers
of
panic
and
expectation
very
destructive
to
a
sound
business
judgment
upon
one
day
i
would
declare
that
a
large
consignment
of
pottery
being
about
to
reach
me
i
could
sell
pipkins
at
half
the
usual
price
pipkins
fell
heavily
and
i
bought
through
my
agent
every
pipkin
i
could
lay
hold
of
the
supposed
consignment
i
would
then
put
about
had
been
broken
to
atoms
by
an
avalanche
which
had
overwhelmed
the
caravan
at
the
very
boundaries
of
the
state
price
leapt
upward
and
as
i
was
the
author
of
the
rumour
i
was
also
the
first
to
take
advantage
of
the
rise
in
price
but
the
very
moment
my
dear
nephews
that
my
sluggish
competitors
attempted
to
follow
suit
the
market
would
oddly
enough
fluctuate
again
in
a
direction
upon
a
certain
morning
when
one
abdullah
who
was
my
boon
companion
and
the
next
merchant
in
importance
to
myself
decided
to
mark
his
best
pipkins
at
ten
dinars
the
dozen
i
happened
most
prudently
to
have
offered
my
own
at
eight
and
a
half
dinars
to
my
favourite
customers
and
all
this
while
i
lived
upon
my
hidden
hoard
poor
abdullah
came
to
me
in
a
sweat
very
early
the
next
morning
and
after
some
meaningless
compliments
and
many
pauses
asked
me
to
go
into
partnership
for
said
he
though
he
admitted
he
had
not
my
capacities
yet
he
had
a
long
experience
in
the
trade
a
large
connection
and
many
influential
friends
in
the
allied
lines
of
pipkin
brokerage
pipkin
insurance
pipkin
discount
pipkin
remainders
and
a
most
important
branch
the
buying
and
selling
of
imaginary
he
could
he
anxiously
assured
me
be
of
great
service
as
an
ally
but
he
was
free
to
confess
that
if
he
continued
as
he
was
he
would
be
ruined
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
already
come
to
the
end
of
his
resources
and
had
not
a
dinar
in
the
house
i
heard
him
out
with
a
grave
and
sympathetic
countenance
heaving
deep
sighs
when
he
touched
upon
his
fears
nodding
and
smiling
when
he
spoke
of
his
advantages
patting
him
affectionately
when
he
professed
his
devotion
to
myself
and
assuming
a
look
of
anguish
when
he
spoke
of
his
approaching
ruin
but
when
he
had
concluded
almost
in
tears
i
told
him
in
tones
somewhat
slower
and
graver
than
my
ordinary
that
i
had
one
fixed
principle
in
life
bequeathed
me
by
my
dear
father
now
in
paradise
to
enter
into
no
not
with
my
nearest
and
dearest
but
ever
to
remain
alone
in
my
transactions
i
frankly
admitted
that
this
made
me
a
poor
man
and
would
keep
me
poor
it
would
be
greatly
to
my
advantage
in
the
despicable
goods
of
this
world
to
have
at
my
disposal
abdullah
s
marvellous
experience
his
great
array
of
family
and
business
connections
to
which
my
wretched
birth
could
make
no
claim
and
above
all
his
genius
for
following
the
market
but
the
goods
of
this
world
were
perishable
especially
earthenware
and
the
sacred
pledge
given
to
my
sainted
parent
counted
more
with
me
than
all
the
baked
mud
in
the
world
as
i
thus
spoke
abdullah
s
breast
heaved
with
tempestuous
sobs
provoked
by
the
affecting
example
of
my
filial
piety
but
also
i
fear
by
the
black
prospect
of
his
own
future
i
could
not
bear
to
witness
his
distress
i
hastened
to
relieve
it
though
my
vow
i
said
forbade
me
solemnly
to
enter
into
partnership
yet
i
could
be
of
service
to
him
in
another
manner
i
would
lend
him
money
at
a
low
rate
of
interest
to
the
value
of
half
his
stock
upon
the
security
of
the
whole
times
would
change
the
present
ruinous
price
of
pipkins
by
which
i
myself
suffered
severely
could
not
long
endure
he
would
lift
his
head
again
and
could
repay
me
at
his
leisure
he
thanked
me
profusely
kissed
my
hand
again
and
again
and
gave
me
an
appointment
next
day
to
view
his
merchandise
and
draw
up
the
contract
i
visited
him
at
the
hour
agreed
the
public
notaries
drew
up
an
inventory
of
his
whole
stock
including
his
house
and
furniture
his
prayer
beads
which
i
was
interested
in
for
they
were
of
a
costly
persian
make
his
dead
wife
s
jewels
all
his
clothes
his
bed
and
his
pet
cat
an
animal
of
no
recorded
pedigree
but
reputed
to
be
of
the
pure
kashmir
breed
i
carefully
noted
all
flaws
however
slight
in
each
pipkin
of
his
warehouse
and
set
all
such
damaged
goods
aside
as
a
makeweight
the
sound
pipkins
i
made
no
bones
of
but
accepted
frankly
at
their
market
value
and
when
the
whole
was
added
up
the
valuation
came
to
no
less
than
dinars
yet
so
in
routine
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
that
abdullah
if
you
will
believe
me
had
actually
set
his
business
stock
down
in
his
old
books
at
that
amount
as
i
had
had
to
carry
on
i
had
not
now
left
by
me
my
full
hoard
of
dinars
i
had
but
left
yet
i
was
in
no
difficulty
half
is
but
there
would
be
deductions
the
costs
of
all
this
inventory
and
mortgage
were
of
course
set
down
against
my
valued
friend
abdullah
but
since
he
had
not
the
ready
cash
wherewith
to
pay
the
notaries
their
clerks
the
demurrage
fees
the
stamps
the
royal
licence
the
enregistration
the
triplicates
the
broker
s
commission
the
pray
uncle
cried
the
youngest
of
the
nephews
what
are
all
these
you
must
not
interrupt
me
my
boy
answered
the
great
merchant
a
little
testily
they
are
the
necessary
accompaniments
of
such
transactions
well
as
i
was
saying
the
broker
s
commission
the
porter
s
wages
the
gratuities
to
the
notaries
servants
the
cleaning
up
of
the
warehouse
after
all
was
over
and
a
hundred
other
petty
items
i
generously
allowed
them
to
be
deducted
from
the
loan
for
our
prophet
has
said
is
he
that
shall
grant
delay
to
his
that
very
evening
with
every
phrase
of
goodwill
and
expressed
hopes
for
his
speedy
recovery
of
fortune
i
counted
out
to
my
dear
friend
abdullah
the
full
balance
of
dinars
and
one
half
dinar
and
left
him
overjoyed
at
the
possession
of
so
much
immediate
wealth
but
alas
no
man
can
forecast
the
morrow
and
all
things
were
written
at
the
beginning
to
be
as
they
shall
be
so
far
from
pipkins
rising
the
price
fell
slowly
and
regularly
for
three
months
during
which
time
i
was
careful
to
restrict
my
own
production
somewhat
though
my
poor
dear
friend
in
his
necessity
produced
more
feverishly
than
ever
and
thereby
did
but
lower
still
further
the
now
really
infamous
price
of
pipkins
at
last
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
could
produce
no
more
i
gladly
allowed
the
first
the
second
and
even
the
third
arrears
of
interest
to
be
added
to
the
principal
at
a
most
moderate
compound
rate
but
there
was
some
fatality
upon
him
and
i
was
inexpressibly
shocked
to
hear
one
morning
that
abdullah
had
drowned
himself
over
night
in
a
beautiful
little
lake
which
his
long
dead
wife
had
designed
for
him
in
his
once
charming
pleasure
oh
poor
man
cried
all
the
nephews
in
chorus
poor
man
poor
man
indeed
echoed
their
benevolent
uncle
i
was
a
stranger
in
that
country
he
was
the
closest
tie
i
had
to
it
and
indeed
in
my
loneliness
the
nearest
companion
i
had
in
the
whole
and
here
the
good
old
man
paused
to
breathe
a
prayer
for
the
departed
companion
of
his
youth
he
then
sighed
deeply
and
continued
i
used
what
had
now
become
my
considerable
influence
with
the
government
to
provide
him
a
costly
funeral
at
the
public
expense
for
he
had
left
no
effects
nor
even
children
to
follow
him
i
walked
behind
the
coffin
as
chief
mourner
and
though
i
attempted
to
control
my
grief
all
the
vast
crowd
assembled
were
moved
by
my
manly
sorrow
and
several
spoke
to
me
upon
it
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sad
rites
i
allowed
the
decent
interval
of
three
days
to
elapse
and
then
did
what
i
had
no
choice
but
to
do
i
took
over
abdullah
s
factory
on
foreclosure
and
added
it
to
my
own
in
this
way
the
valuable
kilns
and
stores
of
clay
and
wheels
and
vehicles
all
became
my
property
i
had
them
valued
and
was
pleasurably
surprised
to
discover
that
they
were
worth
at
least
dinars
a
full
two
years
had
now
passed
since
my
first
coming
to
this
happy
and
secluded
valley
where
allah
had
poured
out
upon
me
his
blessings
in
so
marvellous
a
fashion
i
was
lonely
as
you
may
imagine
but
i
manfully
faced
my
duty
i
continued
to
supervise
and
extend
my
manufactory
of
pipkins
which
now
provided
these
articles
for
more
than
half
the
households
of
the
state
i
therefore
could
and
did
put
the
price
of
these
useful
articles
upon
a
basis
which
if
it
was
somewhat
higher
than
that
to
which
people
had
grown
accustomed
during
my
earlier
manipulations
had
the
priceless
advantage
of
security
so
that
the
housewife
could
always
know
exactly
what
she
had
to
disburse
and
i
what
i
should
receive
as
i
manufactured
upon
so
large
a
scale
my
overhead
charges
what
are
overhead
began
the
eldest
nephew
when
his
uncle
visibly
perturbed
shouted
silence
you
have
made
me
forget
what
i
was
going
to
say
there
was
an
awkward
pause
during
which
the
old
man
restored
his
ruffled
temper
and
proceeded
i
was
able
to
buy
clay
more
cheaply
and
better
than
the
private
for
so
they
were
now
called
with
well
merited
contempt
who
still
vainly
attempted
to
compete
with
me
and
my
business
automatically
grew
as
the
poor
remnant
of
theirs
declined
not
only
did
i
continually
increase
in
wealth
by
these
somewhat
obvious
methods
but
also
in
the
power
of
controlling
property
for
when
some
fresh
fool
among
my
fellow
found
himself
in
difficulties
it
was
my
practice
to
seek
him
secretly
to
condole
with
him
upon
what
i
had
heard
was
his
approaching
misfortune
and
to
save
him
from
ruin
by
taking
over
the
whole
of
his
stock
nay
i
would
do
more
i
would
rescue
him
from
the
sad
necessity
of
attempting
some
new
unknown
trade
by
taking
him
into
my
own
employment
at
a
generous
salary
but
upon
a
monthly
agreement
with
a
pretty
concession
to
sentiment
i
would
even
leave
him
to
manage
his
own
dear
old
booth
in
the
bazaar
to
which
so
many
years
had
now
accustomed
him
i
look
back
with
pleasure
upon
the
tears
of
gratitude
which
stood
in
the
eyes
of
those
to
whom
i
extended
such
favours
so
things
went
on
for
one
more
year
and
another
and
another
till
the
fifth
year
of
my
sojourn
among
these
simple
people
was
completed
i
was
in
complete
control
of
the
pipkin
trade
making
all
the
pipkins
that
the
nation
needed
and
free
from
any
rival
the
house
which
i
had
built
for
myself
was
the
finest
in
the
place
but
covered
i
humbly
add
with
many
a
sacred
text
above
its
vast
horseshoe
gate
ablaze
with
azure
tiles
was
inscribed
in
gold
the
sentence
wealth
is
of
god
i
was
popularly
known
as
or
the
pipkin
king
but
officially
decorated
with
the
local
title
of
warzan
dahur
which
was
the
highest
they
knew
and
signifies
leader
in
i
was
entitled
to
wear
a
sword
with
a
silver
hilt
in
a
jewelled
scabbard
an
ornament
of
which
i
was
justly
proud
but
the
blade
of
which
i
very
sensibly
kept
blunt
lest
my
servant
should
cut
himself
when
he
polished
it
or
even
i
should
inadvertently
do
myself
a
mischief
when
i
pulled
it
out
with
a
flourish
to
display
it
to
my
guests
or
saluted
with
it
on
parade
i
had
become
a
most
intimate
companion
of
the
court
and
was
the
most
trusted
counsellor
of
the
king
to
whose
wives
also
i
often
lent
small
sums
of
money
nor
did
i
ask
to
be
repaid
in
such
a
situation
i
mused
upon
my
condition
and
felt
within
me
strange
promptings
for
a
new
and
larger
life
i
was
now
well
advanced
in
manhood
i
was
filled
with
desires
for
action
and
device
which
the
narrow
field
of
that
happy
but
restricted
place
could
not
fulfil
i
longed
for
adventurous
action
in
a
larger
world
the
output
and
consumption
of
pipkins
was
at
an
exact
unchangeable
level
the
revenue
a
fixed
amount
the
profit
of
the
trade
i
held
came
to
some
dinars
in
the
year
the
full
purchase
of
which
should
be
say
dinars
i
prayed
earnestly
for
guidance
and
one
night
as
i
so
prayed
an
idea
was
revealed
to
me
by
the
most
high
i
approached
the
king
and
told
him
how
all
my
life
i
had
nourished
the
secret
belief
that
a
trade
necessary
to
the
whole
community
should
not
in
justice
be
controlled
by
a
private
individual
but
should
rather
be
the
full
property
of
the
state
of
which
his
majesty
was
the
sole
guardian
the
king
listened
to
me
with
rapt
attention
as
i
unfolded
with
an
inspired
eloquence
my
faith
that
no
one
man
should
intercept
profits
which
were
due
to
the
work
of
all
it
is
your
majesty
i
cried
who
alone
should
have
control
over
what
concerns
the
body
corporate
of
your
he
and
he
alone
should
superintend
the
purchase
of
pipkins
should
regulate
their
sales
should
receive
all
sums
paid
for
them
and
should
use
that
revenue
as
he
might
think
best
for
himself
and
the
commonwealth
while
i
was
struggling
in
the
dust
and
confusion
of
commercial
life
i
concluded
i
had
no
leisure
to
work
out
my
scheme
in
its
entirety
nor
even
to
appreciate
its
serene
equity
but
now
now
i
see
i
understand
i
know
carried
away
by
the
fire
of
my
conviction
my
royal
master
could
no
longer
brook
delay
he
bade
me
put
the
idea
in
its
main
lines
before
him
at
once
and
assured
me
it
should
at
once
be
put
into
execution
i
thereupon
pulled
out
a
paper
showing
that
since
i
was
fully
agreeable
to
take
no
more
than
the
cash
value
of
the
trade
goodwill
and
certain
probable
gains
which
i
might
reasonably
expect
in
the
future
i
would
be
amply
compensated
if
i
were
to
hand
all
over
to
the
commonwealth
for
the
merely
nominal
sum
of
half
a
million
dinars
a
sum
which
i
continued
is
of
little
moment
to
your
majesty
especially
as
it
will
be
met
by
the
taxation
of
your
willing
and
loyal
the
matter
was
at
once
concluded
my
great
act
of
renunciation
was
everywhere
acclaimed
with
transports
of
public
joy
every
honour
was
heaped
upon
me
the
king
himself
pronounced
my
panegyric
at
the
farewell
banquet
given
in
my
honour
and
an
inscription
was
ordered
to
be
encrusted
in
the
most
gorgeous
tiles
on
the
chief
gate
of
the
city
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
shaaban
in
the
three
hundred
and
third
year
from
the
flight
of
the
prophet
by
the
act
of
mahmoud
the
magnificent
all
citizens
became
in
the
matter
of
pipkins
his
common
the
merchant
had
been
so
moved
by
these
old
memories
that
he
had
difficulty
in
proceeding
he
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
ended
in
a
more
subdued
tone
the
sum
of
dinars
well
packed
will
load
without
discomfort
some
dozen
camels
these
and
their
drivers
were
provided
me
by
a
grateful
nation
i
passed
out
of
the
town
at
sunrise
attended
by
a
vast
concourse
of
the
populace
who
pressed
round
me
in
a
delirium
of
grateful
cries
and
so
took
my
way
eastward
across
the
mountains
and
left
this
happy
vale
at
that
moment
the
detestable
falsetto
of
the
muezzin
was
heard
from
the
neighbouring
minaret
and
the
boys
all
dazed
at
the
recital
of
such
triumphs
left
the
presence
of
their
uncle
as
though
it
had
been
that
of
a
god
القنطرة
that
is
the
bridge
chapter
iv
entitled
or
the
bridge
when
the
hour
of
public
executions
had
arrived
and
the
boys
were
assembled
once
more
at
their
uncle
s
feet
to
hear
the
story
of
his
fortunes
their
minds
full
of
his
last
success
the
old
man
still
occupied
with
that
pleasing
memory
began
at
once
the
continuation
of
his
life
i
left
the
valley
as
i
told
you
my
dear
nephews
nourished
by
the
memory
of
a
whole
people
s
gratitude
and
giving
thanks
to
god
who
had
made
me
the
humble
instrument
of
so
great
a
good
they
err
who
think
that
great
wealth
is
marked
with
oppression
or
that
the
rich
man
has
despoiled
the
populace
upon
the
contrary
the
fortunes
of
the
wealthy
are
but
an
index
of
what
excellent
work
they
have
done
for
all
and
i
for
my
part
equally
joined
in
my
heart
the
memory
of
all
the
benefits
i
had
conferred
upon
my
kind
in
the
matter
of
pipkins
and
my
overflowing
satisfaction
at
the
heavy
bags
of
coin
which
swayed
upon
the
backs
of
my
camels
day
after
day
we
proceeded
my
caravan
and
i
through
the
high
hills
pitching
our
camp
each
evening
by
some
wooded
torrent
side
and
nourishing
ourselves
with
the
provisions
with
which
i
had
amply
stored
my
company
at
my
departure
such
scenes
were
solemn
and
inclined
the
mind
to
reverence
never
had
my
prayers
been
more
sincere
and
deep
than
they
were
during
the
long
watches
i
passed
in
the
cloudless
nights
of
those
mountains
in
the
solemnity
of
their
vast
woods
and
the
holy
thoughts
of
grateful
affluence
harmonized
with
the
ceaseless
voices
of
the
forest
i
had
during
this
long
journey
through
the
barrier
range
but
little
opportunity
to
exercise
those
gifts
in
which
i
may
humbly
say
i
excel
for
these
villages
were
few
and
poor
and
the
opportunities
for
talent
were
rare
it
was
indeed
my
duty
to
keep
my
hand
in
as
the
saying
goes
and
not
to
let
my
wealth
diminish
as
i
passed
thus
i
would
for
mere
practice
strike
some
little
bargain
from
time
to
time
i
would
purchase
obsolete
arms
from
some
village
less
backward
than
the
rest
and
sell
them
at
some
further
stage
onward
to
rude
mountaineers
who
had
not
even
heard
of
such
ancient
weapons
i
was
not
above
offering
to
carry
as
my
caravan
passed
sundry
goods
from
one
farm
to
another
at
an
agreed
price
and
these
after
selecting
what
from
among
them
seemed
to
me
best
worth
keeping
i
would
punctually
deliver
to
their
consignees
i
amused
myself
at
my
leisure
also
when
i
was
in
no
haste
with
occasional
experiments
in
engineering
such
as
suit
the
more
educated
man
among
his
fellows
thus
i
would
let
the
water
out
from
a
dam
as
i
passed
it
and
then
at
a
considerable
price
repair
the
ravages
the
escaping
water
might
have
made
in
the
valley
below
and
i
was
even
agreeable
to
retrace
my
steps
and
repair
the
damage
which
the
flood
had
inevitably
occasioned
to
the
barrier
itself
charging
a
suitable
sum
for
both
operations
sometimes
when
the
occasion
offered
i
did
business
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
i
remember
purchasing
a
whole
train
of
wheat
which
was
on
its
way
to
one
of
the
larger
hamlets
and
when
i
arrived
there
keeping
the
people
in
some
suspense
but
not
to
the
point
of
actual
famine
until
their
necessity
very
naturally
produced
an
excellent
price
for
the
grain
i
also
negotiated
ransoms
from
time
to
time
upon
commission
when
i
found
myself
in
a
district
of
brigands
simple
folk
and
i
picked
up
some
very
curious
carvings
and
pieces
of
metal
work
at
a
price
satisfying
to
their
rude
owners
yet
promising
an
enormous
profit
when
i
should
reach
the
plains
but
all
these
were
mere
jests
and
pastimes
the
occupation
of
enforced
idleness
as
my
long
journey
through
the
hills
continued
at
last
i
came
to
a
place
which
had
been
described
to
me
by
a
trusty
servant
where
from
the
height
of
a
pass
i
saw
some
thousands
of
feet
below
me
the
foothills
descending
rapidly
on
to
an
even
plain
which
stretched
brown
and
to
the
horizon
not
far
from
the
base
of
the
mountains
at
the
edge
of
this
plain
a
noble
river
wandered
in
many
branches
separated
by
sandbanks
for
i
had
been
seven
weeks
in
the
hills
and
it
was
now
the
height
of
summer
the
snows
had
long
since
melted
away
on
the
heights
and
the
stream
was
low
i
pitched
my
last
camp
a
mile
or
two
from
the
hither
bank
of
this
great
river
and
sent
forward
certain
of
my
servants
to
discover
how
best
it
might
be
crossed
they
returned
the
next
morning
and
told
me
that
in
several
of
its
branches
it
was
too
deep
to
be
forded
but
at
the
place
where
the
shores
seemed
to
approach
each
other
where
there
was
no
interrupting
islands
but
one
continuous
sea
of
water
four
furlongs
wide
a
ferry
had
been
established
from
a
and
plied
regularly
for
the
passage
of
merchants
pilgrims
and
other
travellers
who
there
went
over
from
the
hills
to
the
kingdom
of
the
plain
upon
the
further
bank
i
sent
them
back
with
an
appointment
for
the
ferry
to
be
prepared
to
take
my
numerous
caravan
from
the
first
hour
after
sunrise
on
the
morrow
we
packed
all
our
gear
struck
camp
in
the
first
dusk
of
dawn
and
duly
reached
the
ferry
head
where
a
large
flat
boat
manned
with
a
dozen
rowers
captained
by
the
old
ferryman
of
the
place
waited
us
on
a
sort
of
wharf
the
passage
was
tedious
and
would
take
the
whole
day
for
the
stream
was
swift
and
no
more
than
one
camel
could
cross
at
a
time
i
was
in
some
little
hesitation
how
to
act
if
i
remained
upon
the
hither
bank
until
all
had
passed
over
i
could
not
be
certain
that
my
servants
who
had
gone
ahead
would
not
play
me
a
trick
if
i
crossed
first
i
could
not
overlook
the
doings
of
my
servants
who
had
yet
to
cross
and
though
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
their
perfect
honesty
neither
had
i
any
reason
to
doubt
their
vile
thievish
character
at
last
i
made
the
following
plan
i
discharged
all
the
camels
of
their
packs
putting
the
packs
on
board
in
one
heap
being
very
careful
to
put
on
board
all
the
food
as
well
as
the
coin
with
this
and
one
camel
which
i
attended
myself
and
hobbled
i
crossed
alone
i
then
went
back
again
with
the
ferryman
and
his
crew
still
keeping
my
provisions
and
my
coin
and
brought
over
another
camel
and
his
driver
and
so
on
until
the
whole
of
my
company
was
transferred
not
till
all
the
camels
and
their
drivers
were
assembled
clamouring
with
hunger
upon
the
further
bank
did
i
allow
the
coin
and
food
to
be
landed
under
my
very
eye
the
time
which
all
this
took
made
my
retinue
ravenously
hungry
as
i
have
said
and
as
the
day
wore
on
i
was
indeed
touched
by
the
earnest
prayers
they
made
for
a
little
food
but
i
was
too
wise
to
yield
and
it
was
not
until
the
whole
of
my
company
was
gathered
together
on
the
further
bank
and
i
with
it
that
i
permitted
the
cases
to
be
landed
and
gave
them
all
a
hearty
meal
it
was
by
that
time
near
sunset
we
pitched
our
camp
and
waited
till
the
morning
to
find
a
more
regular
habitation
for
i
had
noticed
a
very
little
way
off
from
the
further
bank
and
somewhat
upstream
not
a
few
scattered
houses
standing
in
gardens
and
shaded
in
a
grove
of
trees
i
had
as
yet
no
plan
how
i
might
use
the
sums
of
which
i
was
possessed
i
was
rather
waiting
for
a
venture
to
come
to
me
than
going
out
myself
to
seek
it
when
a
chance
word
from
the
old
ferryman
as
i
paid
him
the
fares
which
i
had
already
contracted
for
at
a
great
reduction
seeing
how
numerous
we
were
started
me
upon
a
train
of
thought
and
here
my
nephews
i
will
beg
you
to
observe
that
any
hint
of
opportunity
must
be
seized
at
once
it
is
thus
that
great
things
are
done
what
the
ferryman
said
was
a
curse
on
those
who
come
so
loaded
for
he
grumbled
and
contended
that
his
old
crazy
craft
might
have
sprung
a
leak
under
such
a
pressure
of
traffic
yet
said
i
in
reply
you
have
no
lack
of
custom
as
it
is
this
day
s
business
has
left
many
disappointed
and
i
see
upon
the
further
bank
the
fires
of
those
who
have
been
kept
waiting
the
whole
day
they
will
be
a
hundred
or
more
to
claim
your
services
by
that
is
true
he
answered
but
luckily
few
come
as
loaded
as
you
or
with
so
many
beasts
this
is
none
the
less
a
good
place
of
traffic
for
it
is
the
only
passage
across
the
water
for
many
miles
up
and
down
stream
and
serves
the
main
road
through
the
i
asked
him
why
had
he
not
thought
to
meet
the
pressure
by
purchasing
larger
boats
or
more
of
them
and
hiring
more
men
since
it
was
clear
there
was
profit
in
the
place
and
a
greater
demand
of
travellers
than
he
could
accommodate
he
answered
again
in
the
surly
tone
which
people
use
when
they
boast
of
changeless
custom
that
the
old
boat
had
been
good
enough
for
his
father
and
had
served
him
all
his
own
life
and
was
good
enough
for
him
by
this
reply
i
saw
that
he
was
without
the
funds
for
replacing
his
old
boat
by
more
and
better
craft
this
my
discovery
was
the
beginning
of
all
that
followed
before
striking
my
camp
the
next
day
i
first
put
the
old
ferryman
in
a
reasonable
humour
by
giving
him
good
food
and
drink
and
treating
him
honestly
in
my
conversation
when
i
saw
that
he
was
in
a
mood
to
be
approached
i
suggested
that
we
should
enter
a
kind
of
partnership
i
am
said
i
quite
at
my
leisure
i
am
under
no
need
to
go
forward
until
i
choose
i
have
thought
of
hiring
some
one
of
these
habitations
which
i
see
in
yonder
grove
and
of
making
a
long
sojourn
here
for
the
perpetual
spectacle
of
all
this
traffic
crossing
and
a
great
river
under
the
mountains
is
a
the
old
ferryman
answered
that
he
needed
no
partner
that
he
earned
all
that
he
needed
by
his
trade
and
that
he
preferred
to
be
alone
he
also
said
that
my
foreign
face
was
distasteful
to
him
and
that
grand
people
were
often
less
trustworthy
than
they
seemed
your
sentiments
i
answered
are
a
proof
of
your
wisdom
and
also
do
you
honour
but
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
that
if
in
the
place
of
this
one
old
craft
half
a
dozen
good
new
boats
much
larger
and
properly
manned
were
provided
more
comers
would
be
tempted
to
pass
here
there
would
be
less
delay
both
the
volume
of
traffic
and
the
pace
would
be
increased
i
can
not
but
think
it
an
excellent
i
have
found
my
dear
nephews
that
obstinate
old
men
are
easier
to
shepherd
into
financial
schemes
than
any
other
sort
nor
was
i
here
disappointed
the
old
mule
made
the
admission
which
all
such
men
make
after
the
first
conventional
delays
he
said
that
is
all
very
well
but
who
is
to
pay
for
them
i
replied
quietly
that
i
would
i
shall
be
delighted
said
i
to
furnish
half
a
dozen
new
boats
and
to
pay
for
the
men
to
row
them
until
the
new
turnover
begins
all
i
ask
is
that
you
shall
still
keep
your
present
earnings
but
share
with
me
in
equal
amounts
the
new
and
extra
earnings
which
my
plan
will
almost
certainly
it
took
me
some
time
to
rub
into
his
rusty
head
the
terms
of
my
very
favourable
proposal
he
kept
on
mixing
up
the
division
of
any
future
profits
and
the
division
of
his
present
income
never
did
i
appreciate
more
than
during
my
conversations
with
this
stupid
granfer
the
necessity
for
patience
in
spreading
a
commercial
snare
i
was
at
fearful
pains
to
get
the
thing
into
his
obtuse
brain
he
be
no
poorer
for
i
asked
nothing
of
his
present
earnings
he
be
much
richer
for
he
would
have
half
any
future
additions
i
would
guarantee
him
the
income
he
was
already
earning
on
condition
that
the
much
larger
income
to
be
earned
by
my
methods
should
over
and
above
that
guaranteed
revenue
of
his
be
equally
divided
between
us
he
still
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
some
flaw
or
catch
somewhere
he
wanted
the
thing
simple
as
it
was
explained
to
him
over
and
over
again
at
last
he
got
it
clear
he
got
by
heart
and
repeated
the
refrain
can
not
be
poorer
may
be
nor
did
it
occur
to
him
to
wonder
why
i
was
so
oddly
generous
i
had
our
contract
drawn
up
in
due
form
witnessed
and
sealed
i
then
caused
to
be
constructed
by
the
local
shipwrights
four
flat
boats
some
ten
long
by
five
wide
i
saw
to
it
that
they
should
be
painted
in
gay
colours
and
in
general
have
that
vulgar
violence
so
attractive
to
the
masses
on
their
completion
i
added
them
to
the
existing
capital
of
the
ferry
line
at
the
same
time
i
pointed
out
to
him
who
was
now
my
partner
something
which
that
same
stupidity
of
his
had
made
him
miss
to
wit
that
as
he
had
a
monopoly
his
charges
were
far
too
low
moreover
said
i
when
you
consider
what
fine
new
boats
i
have
put
into
service
and
how
as
a
consequence
the
stream
of
traffic
is
increasing
to
neglect
the
opportunity
of
profit
is
a
great
sin
for
which
you
will
be
answerable
on
the
day
of
resurrection
why
it
was
but
yesterday
that
you
passed
over
twice
as
many
people
you
assured
me
as
ever
you
did
in
any
other
one
day
in
your
life
so
wedded
to
custom
was
the
old
gentleman
that
he
still
hesitated
but
remembering
how
right
i
had
been
in
my
innovation
and
unable
to
contest
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
how
from
day
to
day
the
volume
of
traffic
increased
he
at
last
somewhat
reluctantly
consented
the
fares
were
doubled
yet
the
applications
of
people
desiring
to
cross
the
river
grew
no
less
there
arose
a
substantial
profit
over
and
above
the
old
ferryman
s
original
income
to
be
divided
between
us
and
judged
by
the
cost
of
the
new
boats
i
was
making
some
ten
per
cent
upon
my
money
a
very
reasonable
profit
under
the
circumstances
here
mahmoud
the
great
merchant
paused
shut
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
and
continued
in
a
murmur
a
very
reasonable
profit
ten
per
a
very
reasonable
then
suddenly
opening
his
eyes
fiercely
he
fixed
them
upon
his
alarmed
nephews
and
cried
was
it
not
strange
for
a
man
of
my
temperament
to
remain
thus
pottering
with
a
few
boats
and
leaving
sacks
full
of
coin
unused
you
have
only
heard
the
beginning
of
the
scheme
upon
which
i
was
engaged
i
had
already
purchased
a
very
nice
little
property
with
a
convenient
house
upon
it
standing
some
yards
back
from
the
bank
of
the
river
and
perhaps
one
hundred
yards
above
the
ferry
i
next
purchased
a
field
upon
the
further
bank
exactly
opposite
this
house
and
its
garden
i
amused
myself
sometimes
by
rowing
across
the
river
from
the
steps
at
the
foot
of
my
ground
to
the
field
which
i
had
purchased
upon
the
other
side
i
sowed
that
field
with
beans
of
a
particular
kind
with
which
so
i
assured
my
neighbours
i
was
experimenting
after
an
agricultural
fashion
they
were
much
interested
for
agriculture
is
highly
developed
in
that
part
with
the
result
that
the
highest
arts
especially
those
of
finance
are
shamefully
neglected
i
allowed
a
few
months
to
pass
during
which
the
use
of
the
ferry
under
my
improved
methods
had
more
than
trebled
it
attracted
to
itself
now
that
the
passage
was
so
much
easier
forms
of
traffic
which
it
had
hitherto
not
known
i
even
added
to
the
fleet
one
huge
pontoon
for
the
special
service
of
an
elephant
which
we
had
warning
was
to
pass
and
when
this
was
known
those
great
animals
which
had
previously
used
a
ford
several
days
upstream
were
attracted
to
the
shorter
mountain
road
by
the
ferry
when
all
this
was
so
prosperously
established
i
informed
a
few
of
the
friends
i
had
made
in
the
neighbourhood
that
i
must
indulge
in
the
fancy
of
a
rich
man
and
amuse
myself
by
throwing
a
bridge
between
my
house
and
the
field
i
had
bought
upon
the
other
shore
it
will
save
me
said
i
the
perpetual
trouble
of
rowing
across
in
my
little
skiff
and
also
occupy
my
leisure
for
i
am
something
of
an
in
truth
very
little
engineering
was
required
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
drive
strong
piles
at
intervals
into
the
stream
lay
trestles
upon
them
stay
them
with
large
baulks
upon
either
side
and
so
make
a
good
working
bridge
it
was
no
more
than
fit
for
foot
traffic
but
for
this
it
was
very
convenient
having
now
this
communication
i
bought
more
land
upon
the
further
bank
and
developed
there
a
very
nice
little
model
farm
i
will
not
deny
that
foot
passengers
would
occasionally
ask
my
leave
to
cross
by
the
bridge
in
order
to
save
them
the
tedious
passage
by
water
these
i
always
refused
lest
it
should
prejudice
the
interests
of
my
friend
the
ferryman
i
made
an
exception
only
for
one
or
two
neighbours
whom
i
desired
to
favour
and
occasionally
for
really
important
people
with
whom
the
ferryman
would
not
desire
to
quarrel
but
i
have
a
good
heart
and
at
last
i
began
to
wink
at
the
use
of
the
bridge
by
more
than
these
children
especially
for
i
am
very
fond
of
young
people
i
could
not
bear
to
condemn
to
the
troublesome
passage
by
ferry
and
i
gave
orders
to
my
people
to
allow
their
trespass
at
last
a
regular
path
got
established
through
my
farm
and
whether
from
slackness
or
generosity
i
know
not
but
i
allowed
the
crossing
of
the
river
by
my
bridge
to
increase
in
volume
and
to
become
a
daily
practice
when
it
had
reached
a
certain
volume
my
detestation
of
disorder
compelled
me
to
make
certain
regulations
i
put
up
a
gate
at
either
end
and
charged
a
purely
nominal
sum
which
went
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
upkeep
of
the
bridge
though
of
course
it
did
not
nearly
meet
that
expenditure
to
avoid
the
length
and
inconvenience
of
the
passage
by
water
this
toll
was
cheerfully
paid
and
as
the
season
advanced
my
bridge
was
more
and
more
used
my
partner
the
old
ferryman
saw
all
this
with
a
confused
eye
he
had
the
sense
to
see
that
i
would
not
hurt
my
own
investment
by
competition
yet
he
could
not
but
perceive
that
there
was
here
an
increasing
rivalry
to
his
own
route
at
last
he
approached
me
and
asked
me
if
we
could
not
come
to
some
pact
i
said
that
i
saw
no
occasion
for
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
both
i
was
a
wealthy
man
and
an
act
of
generosity
was
a
kind
of
luxury
for
me
i
could
hardly
ask
people
who
had
now
grown
used
to
so
easy
a
passage
to
go
back
to
the
monopoly
of
the
boats
with
their
primitive
slow
and
clumsy
business
of
embarking
and
disembarking
and
their
necessary
delays
and
crowding
i
pointed
out
to
my
revered
partner
that
the
boats
were
still
necessary
for
all
heavy
merchandise
and
for
animals
and
i
also
pointed
out
very
strongly
to
the
ferryman
what
he
could
not
deny
that
i
would
hardly
do
anything
to
prejudice
him
since
that
would
be
also
to
prejudice
myself
as
i
was
his
partner
i
even
ridiculed
him
for
not
perceiving
the
force
of
such
an
argument
before
coming
to
me
and
for
troubling
me
with
what
was
obviously
nonsense
he
still
grumbled
however
he
said
that
he
was
no
scholar
that
it
sounded
all
right
but
that
he
did
not
feel
comfortable
i
answered
that
i
could
not
help
his
feelings
but
it
was
a
plain
matter
of
common
sense
and
so
dismissed
him
i
then
announced
my
intention
of
strengthening
the
bridge
considerably
and
making
it
sufficient
to
support
any
kind
of
traffic
and
so
i
did
at
a
very
considerable
expense
when
i
had
completed
the
task
it
was
a
fine
structure
which
would
take
every
kind
of
beast
of
burden
and
vehicle
and
a
constant
stream
of
the
only
exception
i
made
was
for
elephants
which
animal
i
said
i
might
allow
later
but
not
until
i
had
had
the
whole
thing
thoroughly
tested
these
beasts
therefore
still
had
to
use
the
ferry
but
as
they
were
few
in
number
and
difficult
to
handle
they
only
increased
my
partner
s
troubles
meanwhile
the
fame
of
my
bridge
spread
throughout
all
the
neighbouring
countries
it
gathered
upon
itself
the
whole
volume
of
commerce
the
old
ferryman
came
to
me
in
a
mixed
mood
of
anger
panic
and
delirious
complaint
he
said
that
his
revenue
was
falling
with
alarming
rapidity
added
a
little
spitefully
i
thought
that
my
share
of
that
revenue
would
be
not
a
quarter
of
what
it
had
been
in
the
past
year
and
said
very
plainly
that
if
i
did
not
make
some
change
in
my
regulations
my
own
profit
would
disappear
altogether
that
nothing
would
be
left
but
his
original
revenue
and
that
even
this
was
now
in
doubt
as
i
answered
nothing
to
all
this
long
plea
but
let
him
talk
himself
out
he
ended
up
by
asking
with
some
irony
whether
i
was
one
of
those
rich
fools
who
liked
to
throw
away
their
money
then
it
was
that
i
answered
him
as
he
deserved
to
be
answered
for
i
do
not
easily
brook
insult
i
told
him
that
i
had
mortgaged
my
share
in
the
enterprise
of
the
boats
sometime
before
to
a
neighbour
at
a
very
good
price
before
ever
the
bridge
had
appeared
that
i
was
sufficiently
pestered
by
this
man
who
ascribed
to
me
the
continued
decline
in
the
revenue
which
i
received
and
handed
over
to
him
and
that
i
would
not
have
added
to
this
perpetual
annoyance
the
further
complaint
of
my
inept
partner
i
drove
him
from
my
presence
and
told
him
i
desired
never
to
see
him
again
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
i
had
been
approached
properly
i
would
have
made
some
sort
of
compensation
to
the
neighbour
to
whom
i
had
mortgaged
at
a
fine
figure
my
original
share
in
the
profits
of
the
ferry
i
had
enjoyed
a
large
sum
which
he
could
now
never
recover
and
i
might
have
let
him
have
a
fifth
or
a
quarter
of
it
back
merely
as
a
piece
of
generosity
but
when
i
discovered
that
he
had
himself
resold
his
interest
to
an
ignoramus
who
was
at
that
moment
trying
to
find
a
purchaser
for
his
rapidly
shrinking
property
i
lost
all
patience
with
the
combination
of
them
and
put
every
thought
of
the
ferry
out
of
my
mind
the
new
purchaser
foreclosed
on
his
mortgage
and
got
for
the
ferry
of
what
he
had
lent
on
it
it
was
shortly
after
this
transaction
that
the
old
ferryman
went
mad
it
began
by
his
coming
to
my
house
daily
and
making
scenes
outside
the
doors
then
he
took
to
breaking
the
windows
and
at
last
to
gathering
crowds
and
haranguing
them
on
his
imaginary
persecution
at
my
hands
i
was
compelled
to
have
him
locked
up
in
his
own
defence
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
a
merciful
fever
soon
relieved
him
of
what
had
become
incurable
delusions
he
did
not
recover
his
sanity
however
as
is
so
often
the
case
even
in
the
last
few
hours
before
death
he
continued
to
call
me
the
most
dreadful
names
and
to
rave
in
his
mania
of
persecution
shouting
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
ruined
it
was
a
pitiful
ending
to
what
had
long
been
a
useful
if
obscure
life
as
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
men
whom
he
had
employed
starve
i
took
them
into
my
own
employ
for
the
making
of
a
roadway
to
the
bridge
for
the
further
strengthening
of
it
the
painting
of
it
and
so
on
and
sent
all
the
down
the
river
where
they
would
be
of
more
use
than
at
this
part
where
by
my
enterprise
and
public
spirit
the
bridge
had
come
into
existence
i
purchased
them
as
old
timber
from
the
owners
and
made
an
insignificant
profit
of
some
few
thousand
dinars
it
is
a
pretty
example
of
the
way
in
which
names
cling
to
places
that
the
point
on
the
bank
where
the
ferry
used
to
ply
is
still
called
the
madman
s
for
indeed
the
old
fellow
was
buried
i
heard
by
his
own
request
close
to
where
his
boat
used
to
ply
it
was
now
high
time
to
consider
the
whole
question
of
the
bridge
and
its
finances
through
my
goodness
of
heart
and
generous
carelessness
defects
or
amiable
frailties
against
which
i
have
always
to
be
upon
my
guard
the
whole
thing
had
got
into
a
very
condition
the
tolls
were
not
more
than
customary
payments
though
i
had
raised
them
from
time
to
time
there
was
no
careful
distinction
between
the
different
kinds
of
traffic
there
were
no
regulations
for
the
hours
at
which
the
bridge
should
be
used
nor
ready
means
of
checking
the
accounts
the
new
bridge
had
caused
the
town
to
increase
largely
its
governors
and
those
of
the
adjoining
districts
were
rightly
concerned
in
its
proper
ordering
the
authorities
of
the
neighbourhood
fully
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
the
thing
upon
a
more
regular
footing
i
suggested
to
them
that
before
going
further
it
would
be
but
a
kindly
and
reasonable
act
to
consult
those
who
made
regular
use
of
the
bridge
upon
a
large
scale
and
especially
the
merchants
of
the
place
and
of
the
more
distant
towns
upon
the
farther
bank
who
crossed
and
recrossed
at
stated
intervals
and
with
considerable
trains
of
traffic
these
therefore
were
courteously
convened
they
were
regarded
as
representing
the
mass
of
humbler
footfolk
and
between
us
all
we
drew
up
an
excellent
arrangement
first
we
made
ourselves
into
a
council
next
we
voted
ourselves
full
powers
to
do
what
we
liked
in
managing
the
bridge
the
merchants
who
were
regular
users
of
the
bridge
and
who
passed
and
repassed
with
their
trains
upon
an
average
once
a
month
were
to
be
free
of
toll
on
condition
that
they
should
pay
an
annual
subscription
to
the
upkeep
of
the
structure
it
came
to
an
average
for
each
of
their
beasts
of
burden
to
about
of
the
public
toll
and
for
each
of
their
servants
to
less
than
the
common
folk
of
the
town
and
the
villages
the
herdsmen
and
all
the
humbler
multitude
which
used
the
bridge
in
less
lucrative
fashion
were
to
pay
a
toll
double
the
original
which
after
all
was
only
fair
when
one
considered
that
they
were
compelled
to
use
the
bridge
as
there
was
now
no
other
passage
across
the
stream
i
should
add
that
the
local
authorities
which
sat
with
us
upon
this
council
after
drawing
up
the
ordinances
passed
a
local
full
of
common
sense
and
the
spirit
of
order
in
this
they
forbade
the
use
of
any
boats
whatsoever
for
the
crossing
of
the
water
under
the
excellent
plea
that
men
had
in
the
past
occasionally
been
drowned
from
these
and
that
anyhow
there
was
now
a
good
bridge
and
no
necessity
for
this
and
backward
kind
of
travel
people
were
also
forbidden
to
swim
the
river
between
sunset
and
sunrise
upon
the
grounds
of
security
and
police
control
and
between
sunrise
and
sunset
upon
the
grounds
of
decency
after
the
new
regulations
had
been
passed
the
gates
were
strengthened
regular
officers
were
appointed
to
take
the
toll
and
i
was
enough
to
permit
my
own
servants
to
be
withdrawn
and
these
officials
to
be
named
and
paid
by
the
new
council
retaining
to
myself
no
more
than
the
right
of
receiving
the
tolls
and
taking
on
of
course
the
burden
of
upkeep
as
against
the
sums
which
i
received
from
the
regular
merchants
i
also
reserved
to
myself
the
right
whenever
the
council
or
the
local
authorities
thought
it
necessary
to
have
the
bridge
strengthened
or
repaired
or
painted
or
ornamented
or
decorated
upon
feast
days
or
covered
with
an
awning
during
the
great
heats
to
take
up
the
contract
for
all
these
services
at
a
price
to
be
agreed
upon
between
myself
and
the
council
and
the
local
authorities
at
the
head
of
whom
was
my
dear
old
friend
the
sheik
when
all
these
arrangements
had
been
made
the
thing
was
on
a
proper
basis
and
formed
i
am
glad
to
say
for
many
other
similar
arrangements
a
precedent
in
which
the
advantages
of
the
public
and
a
proper
return
on
capital
were
both
considered
my
bridge
council
as
it
was
called
was
copied
in
many
another
enterprise
in
those
parts
to
not
a
few
of
which
i
was
admitted
as
a
director
but
one
must
march
with
the
times
it
could
not
be
denied
that
this
conservative
and
established
way
of
recouping
expenses
and
interest
by
tolls
excellent
in
its
time
no
doubt
had
its
drawbacks
there
was
something
rather
absurd
in
these
progressive
days
such
was
the
phrase
used
to
me
by
my
friend
the
sheik
of
the
place
which
was
now
growing
under
the
influence
of
my
bridge
to
be
a
very
large
town
there
was
something
rather
absurd
in
the
spectacle
of
gates
put
up
to
block
that
very
passage
which
had
only
been
erected
for
the
convenience
of
the
community
what
would
not
posterity
think
of
us
if
they
heard
that
we
built
a
bridge
and
then
put
up
gates
to
interfere
with
its
constant
and
easy
use
it
was
a
burden
also
upon
the
community
that
officials
should
have
to
be
employed
at
either
end
checking
payments
keeping
books
and
all
the
rest
of
it
what
was
worse
there
seemed
to
be
some
leakage
officials
could
not
always
be
trusted
to
make
an
exact
return
for
they
were
of
the
baser
sort
at
a
small
salary
it
was
suspected
that
their
relatives
and
friends
had
been
allowed
to
cross
free
of
toll
for
we
could
not
keep
a
big
watch
at
night
and
there
was
i
fear
a
good
deal
of
illicit
use
of
the
bridge
all
of
this
quite
apart
from
the
bad
example
it
gave
and
the
feeling
of
disorder
it
created
was
also
a
source
of
anxiety
to
those
who
were
concerned
with
the
finance
of
the
enterprise
the
feeling
grew
rapidly
at
least
it
grew
very
strongly
in
me
and
i
made
every
effort
to
spread
it
in
others
that
progress
and
sundry
other
virtues
with
which
the
plain
prided
itself
as
against
the
people
of
the
mountains
demanded
that
all
these
anomalies
should
cease
and
that
the
simple
policy
of
the
free
bridge
should
as
the
aged
merchant
described
the
last
stage
of
his
adventure
his
face
took
on
an
animated
look
he
spoke
with
decision
there
was
a
freedom
in
his
gesture
which
recalled
his
old
oratorical
triumphs
when
he
had
occasion
as
a
younger
man
to
combine
the
practice
of
commerce
investment
and
finance
with
the
public
speeches
which
had
rendered
him
famous
he
seemed
for
the
moment
not
so
much
the
merchant
as
the
senator
the
free
bridgeite
of
the
great
old
days
and
his
nephews
could
not
but
admire
the
lofty
air
the
direct
glance
the
eloquent
vibration
of
voice
which
accompanied
this
mood
i
for
my
part
continued
the
old
gentleman
now
transformed
by
the
recollection
of
his
part
in
public
life
did
not
fear
to
speak
openly
in
the
council
and
such
was
my
love
for
my
even
in
the
i
was
untiring
in
explaining
the
simple
economic
principles
underlying
the
policy
of
the
free
bridge
i
was
delighted
to
observe
as
my
efforts
proceeded
two
parties
forming
the
free
bridgeites
who
had
the
tide
with
them
and
were
in
the
spirit
of
their
day
and
another
party
which
for
lack
of
a
better
name
i
will
call
the
recalcitrants
who
were
but
a
hotchpotch
of
malcontents
dolts
public
enemies
and
in
general
a
body
who
had
no
argument
save
that
things
were
very
well
as
they
were
and
it
was
a
pity
to
change
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
which
of
these
competing
interests
won
intelligence
business
enterprise
public
spirit
common
sense
justice
and
eighteen
or
nineteen
other
things
which
for
the
moment
escape
me
supported
the
glorious
triumph
of
the
free
bridge
at
last
when
the
moment
was
ripe
for
it
to
be
voted
upon
we
swept
our
opponents
out
of
existence
at
the
polls
securing
out
of
every
votes
no
less
than
for
our
project
the
sheik
who
in
the
growing
importance
of
the
community
was
now
confirmed
in
his
office
by
his
sovereign
under
the
title
of
excellent
delivered
an
unforgettable
harangue
saying
that
the
day
when
the
tolls
should
be
taken
off
the
bridge
and
the
gates
thrown
down
would
stand
in
the
annals
of
his
country
next
to
its
historic
charter
and
its
acceptance
of
the
truth
faith
amid
the
deafening
shouts
of
a
vast
concourse
composed
as
i
was
amused
to
discover
of
both
parties
indifferently
but
all
out
for
the
occasion
this
great
official
proceeded
in
state
to
the
entrance
of
the
bridge
cut
symbolically
the
silken
thread
with
which
the
gates
upon
either
end
had
been
tied
and
in
loud
tones
declared
the
bridge
open
in
the
name
of
allah
and
his
prophet
women
wept
profusely
and
even
strong
men
had
difficulty
in
hiding
their
emotion
only
the
younger
of
the
children
and
the
animals
accompanying
the
procession
appeared
indifferent
of
the
four
officials
deputed
for
the
watching
of
the
tolls
two
were
thrown
into
jail
on
the
charge
of
malversation
the
other
two
were
on
my
making
an
appeal
for
them
allowed
to
leave
the
country
the
head
of
the
opposing
party
who
had
done
his
best
to
defeat
this
great
and
necessary
reform
now
upon
payment
openly
admitted
that
he
was
converted
whatever
sentimental
attachment
he
might
still
cherish
for
his
old
views
he
now
clearly
saw
that
they
were
no
longer
practical
politics
the
gardens
of
the
city
were
illuminated
for
three
successive
nights
cannon
were
fired
and
in
view
of
the
quite
exceptional
character
of
the
occasion
many
criminals
were
pardoned
including
the
young
brother
of
the
head
of
the
opposition
who
under
an
assumed
name
had
languished
in
jail
for
several
months
in
all
this
enthusiasm
it
was
easier
to
get
through
the
practical
details
of
the
change
as
the
obstacle
of
petty
detailed
criticism
proceeding
from
an
ignorant
public
was
removed
a
new
constitution
was
happily
agreed
upon
in
place
of
the
old
revenue
from
tolls
this
old
revenue
had
fluctuated
between
the
annual
amounts
of
and
dinars
to
replace
it
and
to
allow
for
all
contingencies
a
fixed
sum
of
dinars
was
put
aside
as
an
annual
charge
upon
the
public
rates
to
be
allocated
to
the
service
of
the
bridge
this
sum
would
of
course
in
the
natural
course
of
things
have
been
paid
annually
to
myself
but
i
had
other
plans
after
this
decision
to
allocate
dinars
had
been
arrived
at
by
a
unanimous
vote
i
created
a
very
favourable
impression
when
i
rose
in
my
place
and
said
that
i
would
never
occupy
the
privileged
and
in
my
view
corrupt
position
of
a
citizen
drawing
a
regular
pension
from
my
fellows
however
great
my
services
had
been
in
the
past
i
was
glad
that
they
should
be
at
the
disposal
of
my
country
for
so
i
called
the
place
having
lived
in
it
now
two
years
and
more
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
i
was
as
it
were
sucking
the
very
of
the
community
and
drawing
into
my
private
coffers
pence
which
had
been
contributed
for
the
most
part
by
the
humblest
of
my
dear
countrymen
agreement
had
already
been
shown
with
this
announcement
which
came
from
the
depth
of
my
heart
when
the
council
was
overjoyed
to
hear
my
conclusion
it
was
if
anything
even
more
sincere
i
will
accept
said
i
you
really
insist
upon
a
sum
of
money
down
which
might
represent
the
capitalized
value
of
the
revenue
but
i
absolutely
refuse
upon
any
terms
whatsoever
to
remain
a
mere
drone
supported
by
this
active
commercial
community
skimming
the
cream
off
the
taxes
and
feeling
myself
a
burden
where
i
should
be
an
applause
was
almost
unknown
in
the
dignified
debates
of
our
assembly
but
upon
this
occasion
it
could
not
be
restrained
for
some
minutes
together
the
grave
but
voluminous
cheers
of
my
colleagues
assured
me
that
i
had
done
right
and
amply
compensated
me
for
any
loss
that
i
might
suffer
supposing
which
was
after
all
improbable
the
revenue
from
the
bridge
in
the
future
would
largely
rise
such
is
the
frailty
of
human
nature
that
perhaps
the
recognition
of
my
good
deed
would
have
been
less
frank
or
less
simple
had
the
council
themselves
been
compelled
to
find
the
money
out
of
their
own
pockets
but
there
was
no
question
of
this
the
burden
must
fall
as
was
only
just
upon
the
whole
body
of
citizens
since
all
used
the
bridge
my
proposal
met
therefore
with
enthusiastic
assent
from
every
side
and
one
speaker
in
the
ensuing
debate
a
friend
who
in
his
humble
way
was
associated
with
other
of
my
lesser
enterprises
pointed
out
what
i
could
not
in
decency
have
alluded
to
that
i
also
was
a
taxpayer
and
a
large
one
so
that
any
public
payment
was
borne
partly
by
myself
the
sheik
in
closing
the
discussion
after
a
few
compliments
which
my
natural
modesty
forbids
me
to
repeat
said
that
clearly
nothing
was
now
left
but
to
make
a
computation
a
mere
matter
of
and
that
this
detail
might
safely
be
left
to
a
small
committee
of
three
which
was
nominated
upon
the
spot
their
work
was
of
course
honorary
for
they
were
men
of
high
standing
but
i
saw
to
it
that
all
their
expenses
and
other
disbursements
should
be
met
and
i
gave
them
much
hospitality
the
committee
met
at
intervals
during
the
ensuing
three
weeks
i
appeared
frequently
before
this
committee
in
the
capacity
of
witness
i
produced
all
my
books
and
had
i
am
glad
to
say
the
restraint
and
good
feeling
to
let
things
take
their
course
and
not
to
haggle
as
though
this
great
public
settlement
had
been
a
private
commercial
deal
it
is
enough
to
say
that
at
the
end
of
this
proceeding
the
sum
of
dinars
was
awarded
to
me
by
the
arbitrators
and
that
i
after
protesting
against
what
i
called
the
excessive
generosity
of
the
state
then
added
to
my
popularity
by
erecting
at
my
own
charges
a
fine
gate
of
entry
at
the
city
end
of
the
bridge
which
absorbed
half
the
odd
the
other
half
i
gave
in
a
burst
of
generosity
to
the
members
of
the
committee
not
of
course
in
their
public
capacity
but
privately
as
being
my
personal
friends
and
in
reward
for
their
untiring
public
spirit
i
was
left
with
a
million
i
was
fully
content
i
desired
no
but
uncle
timidly
interrupted
the
eldest
of
the
nephews
i
am
puzzled
by
one
thing
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
question
upon
it
certainly
my
dear
lad
said
the
old
man
stroking
his
beard
and
awaiting
the
query
why
uncle
said
the
boy
still
hesitating
somewhat
it
is
this
i
do
not
quite
see
how
it
came
that
you
should
have
a
million
dinars
you
came
to
this
place
with
a
million
how
then
did
it
become
million
the
folly
of
the
question
raised
a
titter
from
his
brothers
who
had
always
regarded
their
senior
as
the
least
brilliant
of
their
clan
but
their
uncle
was
more
lenient
and
checked
their
mirth
which
was
especially
loud
in
the
youngest
and
said
my
dear
boy
do
you
see
anything
extraordinary
in
an
accretion
of
fortune
to
a
man
who
served
the
community
so
well
no
not
exactly
that
said
the
elder
nephew
still
hesitating
far
from
it
dear
uncle
but
what
i
do
not
quite
clearly
see
is
where
the
other
came
foolish
lad
answered
his
relative
now
touched
with
annoyance
it
came
from
my
untiring
devotion
to
the
public
service
from
my
foresight
in
providing
a
magnificent
bridge
which
for
all
those
years
no
one
had
attempted
from
the
freely
expressed
desire
of
my
through
their
honoured
representatives
it
was
indeed
but
a
small
recompense
for
all
the
good
i
had
done
and
all
the
immeasurable
advantage
to
this
town
which
my
energy
had
yes
dear
uncle
but
went
on
the
blushing
lad
oh
don
t
listen
to
him
cried
his
brothers
in
chorus
you
will
never
make
him
understand
our
father
has
always
said
that
he
could
not
even
do
his
arithmetic
and
the
shrill
laugh
of
the
youngest
was
heard
at
the
end
of
his
protest
well
well
said
mahmoud
we
will
not
quarrel
about
at
that
moment
the
intolerable
shriek
of
the
muezzin
calling
the
faithful
to
prayer
was
heard
from
the
neighbouring
minaret
and
the
somewhat
strained
situation
was
relieved
milh
that
is
salt
chapter
v
entitled
or
salt
when
his
nephews
next
filed
into
the
presence
of
mahmoud
at
the
hour
of
public
executions
their
first
act
was
to
stand
in
a
line
and
salaam
their
next
to
push
forward
the
eldest
who
with
much
catching
up
of
himself
and
in
the
humblest
tones
desired
to
apologize
to
his
uncle
for
the
interruption
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
during
their
last
audience
it
is
not
my
fault
revered
sir
said
he
that
i
was
born
a
little
in
the
matter
of
figures
the
whole
thing
has
been
explained
to
me
most
fully
by
my
father
my
mother
my
brothers
and
sundry
guests
that
came
in
last
night
after
the
evening
meal
to
which
alas
we
could
not
afford
to
invite
them
i
now
see
very
clearly
where
and
how
a
million
can
become
two
without
breeding
and
i
only
hope
that
in
the
further
story
of
your
adventures
we
shall
find
miraculously
increasing
with
every
year
the
fortune
which
the
almighty
bestowed
upon
you
in
reward
for
your
ceaseless
efforts
to
benefit
having
said
this
the
lad
bowed
once
more
in
deep
obeisance
while
at
a
signal
from
one
of
their
uncle
s
attendant
slaves
all
the
brothers
sank
to
the
floor
and
assumed
expressions
of
the
most
enraptured
attention
there
was
no
need
said
the
old
man
kindly
to
refer
again
to
this
unfortunate
little
affair
but
since
you
have
done
so
i
am
indeed
glad
to
learn
that
your
difficulties
have
been
explained
away
no
doubt
your
excellent
father
my
brother
and
his
guests
made
it
plain
to
you
that
if
anything
my
reward
had
been
far
below
that
to
which
i
was
morally
entitled
for
a
man
who
not
only
builds
for
a
city
a
fine
bridge
but
also
from
a
pure
public
spirit
leaves
it
open
and
free
to
all
is
worthy
of
very
high
reward
indeed
at
the
hands
of
the
commonwealth
but
to
tell
the
truth
though
i
am
not
indifferent
to
success
in
any
task
i
take
up
i
was
not
so
much
concerned
with
the
worldly
advantage
of
my
increased
fortune
as
with
the
good
i
had
done
and
with
the
knowledge
that
it
would
add
to
my
glory
in
paradise
for
it
is
written
works
are
remembered
on
high
the
building
of
a
bridge
the
digging
of
a
well
and
the
pulling
down
of
poor
men
s
in
the
last
part
of
what
you
said
my
dear
nephews
i
fear
you
will
be
disappointed
for
the
story
i
have
to
tell
and
here
his
voice
fell
to
a
graver
tone
is
one
of
strange
disaster
i
desire
you
to
bear
my
losses
even
more
closely
in
mind
than
the
previous
accounts
of
my
rising
fortunes
or
than
those
other
accounts
which
will
follow
and
will
show
how
i
recovered
my
standing
in
the
world
for
it
would
indeed
be
a
poor
service
i
should
do
you
young
people
if
i
were
to
leave
you
under
the
error
that
energy
and
adventure
alone
add
gold
to
gold
no
nor
even
cunning
for
there
is
also
the
will
of
the
supreme
what
is
the
sleight
of
hand
or
eye
without
him
asked
the
old
merchant
in
a
rapture
as
his
youngest
nephew
cleverly
swallowed
a
yawn
do
you
hope
for
gain
by
the
folly
of
your
dupe
or
even
by
your
own
stupidity
it
is
far
otherwise
our
sacred
books
present
us
with
many
an
example
of
good
men
whom
the
infinite
mercy
has
seen
fit
to
try
it
is
our
conduct
under
these
ordeals
which
are
the
true
test
of
character
and
the
only
foundations
of
our
future
and
eternal
reward
by
so
much
as
i
ascribe
to
the
mercy
of
allah
whatever
goods
have
befallen
me
by
so
much
do
i
ascribe
to
his
inscrutable
wisdom
and
kindness
even
the
sharp
reverses
of
this
life
for
by
these
we
learn
that
there
is
an
element
of
speculation
in
all
business
that
we
are
surrounded
by
the
competition
of
rivals
whom
we
should
never
despise
that
our
friends
ever
lie
in
wait
to
outwit
us
it
is
only
by
the
humble
acceptation
of
such
lessons
that
we
become
even
more
acute
in
dealing
with
our
than
we
were
before
we
had
suffered
loss
however
i
will
not
delay
but
proceed
at
once
to
the
harrowing
tale
for
you
must
now
follow
your
poor
uncle
through
dark
and
distressing
as
he
said
these
words
the
features
of
his
young
relatives
betrayed
the
utmost
concern
none
more
than
those
of
the
youngest
the
great
pathos
of
whose
expression
oddly
assorted
with
the
innocence
of
his
years
you
must
know
then
began
the
old
man
that
my
prime
error
at
this
moment
in
my
career
was
a
desire
for
ease
i
thought
i
say
it
to
my
shame
that
i
had
made
enough
to
use
the
familiar
language
of
the
market
i
regarded
my
present
fortune
of
a
million
dinars
as
my
to
use
another
phrase
which
you
will
come
across
very
frequently
in
your
maturer
years
i
was
ready
to
retire
oh
fatal
error
oh
profound
ingratitude
here
was
i
still
in
the
vigour
of
early
manhood
for
i
had
but
just
attained
my
thirtieth
year
on
the
full
tide
of
an
apparent
success
blessed
in
all
my
doings
and
yet
already
with
a
paltry
million
in
hand
so
ungrateful
to
god
as
to
entertain
a
shameful
temptation
to
leisure
the
result
shall
be
a
warning
to
you
i
hope
and
to
any
who
may
come
across
this
recital
the
insidious
poison
of
content
had
all
unknown
to
myself
wormed
its
way
into
my
heart
i
had
for
the
moment
at
least
wearied
of
getting
the
better
of
others
which
should
be
the
chief
activity
of
a
man
i
was
already
toying
with
such
fripperies
as
the
reading
of
books
the
contemplation
of
fine

the
designing
of
a
house
for
myself
the
planning
of
gardens
futile
conversation
with
the
learned
and
worst
of
all
the
taking
of
an
interest
in
the
past
beyond
this
foolish
bent
for
acquiring
knowledge
of
dead
things
i
descended
to
the
pen
i
actually
began
to
write
to
the
writing
of
verse
i
humbly
thank
god
i
never
fell
but
had
not
a
sharp
chastisement
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
might
have
come
to
it
you
know
perhaps
my
dear
nephews
that
there
are
some
men
so
lost
to
all
shame
that
on
finding
themselves
possessed
of
a
considerable
sum
they
will
not
embark
it
in
commerce
nor
even
lend
it
out
at
interest
to
the
widow
and
the
orphan
to
the
teachers
of
our
holy
religion
or
to
districts
struck
by
famine
indeed
they
make
no
lucrative
employment
of
it
but
yielding
to
a
base
appetite
for
repose
they
draw
upon
it
as
they
need
until
it
is
wholly
oh
how
shocking
piped
a
shrill
voice
interrupting
the
merchant
in
his
eloquence
the
cry
proceeded
from
the
youngest
you
feel
strongly
my
little
fellow
said
his
uncle
and
you
are
quite
right
i
am
delighted
to
find
that
one
so
young
has
already
so
sound
a
sense
of
our
duty
in
the
battle
of
life
there
are
i
repeat
men
so
despicable
that
they
will
put
their
substance
aside
taking
from
it
what
they
need
from
day
to
day
until
one
of
these
two
events
befalls
them
at
the
worst
they
live
too
long
and
spend
their
last
miserable
years
in
destitution
at
the
best
and
it
is
a
poor
best
they
live
too
short
and
have
the
infinite
mortification
in
the
agony
of
death
to
discover
that
they
might
have
had
some
slightly
larger
income
had
they
made
a
more
exact
calculation
i
am
speaking
frankly
to
you
my
nephews
in
spite
of
the
difference
in
our
ages
and
of
the
respect
you
owe
me
as
the
head
of
the
family
when
i
confess
so
great
a
depth
of
degradation
as
this
i
did
not
put
this
million
which
i
had
acquired
aside
i
used
it
fruitfully
but
my
mind
was
occupied
even
after
so
many
years
i
blush
to
recall
it
in
seeking
some
secure
and
permanent
form
of
revenue
so
that
i
should
be
free
henceforth
from
the
labour
and
risk
of
buying
cheap
and
selling
dear
and
from
the
duty
of
hunting
the
dupe
and
the
incompetent
while
i
was
revolving
in
my
mind
how
best
i
might
obtain
this
leisure
there
came
to
me
my
temptation
for
a
traveller
arriving
in
the
city
of
the
bridge
let
it
be
known
to
the
merchants
of
the
place
that
the
king
of
an
island
called
izmar
one
day
s
sail
from
the
coast
a
kingdom
renowned
throughout
asia
for
its
fidelity
to
the
prophet
the
antiquity
of
its
customs
the
solidity
of
its
institutions
required
a
loan
for
what
purpose
i
asked
him
i
know
not
he
answered
but
i
think
it
is
in
order
to
pay
back
another
loan
which
he
contracted
some
years
ago
in
the
effort
to
pay
another
loan
which
his
father
had
contracted
when
a
few
years
previously
he
had
been
compelled
to
repay
an
earlier
i
admired
the
scrupulous
anxiety
of
this
monarch
and
was
the
more
confirmed
in
the
project
that
was
forming
in
my
mind
that
very
night
i
bade
farewell
not
without
grief
to
the
city
of
the
bridge
i
sold
my
slaves
and
my
house
at
some
loss
such
was
my
infatuation
and
before
it
was
light
started
out
upon
a
good
horse
carrying
with
me
my
million
dinars
reduced
to
one
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
which
in
this
form
could
easily
be
carried
upon
a
few
pack
animals
that
followed
me
with
their
drivers
my
passage
of
the
sea
was
easy
i
saw
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
fine
mountains
against
the
south
and
very
soon
i
discerned
at
their
base
on
the
shore
the
walls
the
piers
the
minarets
of
a
great
city
its
flanks
upon
the
edges
of
the
sea
so
did
i
land
under
a
good
augury
everything
in
the
place
as
i
passed
through
it
smiled
at
my
project
the
wealth
of
the
great
houses
the
busy
commerce
of
the
streets
the
port
quite
filled
with
shipping
from
every
place
the
sounds
of
strange
tongues
men
not
only
from
all
islam
but
nazarenes
also
and
kafir
and
merchants
of
china
the
excellent
order
everywhere
about
all
these
promised
me
the
security
which
i
desired
i
put
on
my
best
raiment
finely
fringed
and
all
my
jewels
and
presented
myself
to
the
as
upon
a
matter
of
state
business
handing
him
at
the
same
time
in
a
lofty
manner
a
roll
which
i
begged
to
have
delivered
to
the
controllers
of
the
treasury
the
master
of
the
port
treated
me
with
the
reverence
my
wealth
deserved
i
reposed
for
an
hour
in
the
court
of
his
house
resting
to
the
pleasant
trickle
of
a
fountain
and
waiting
the
pleasure
of
the
authorities
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
dozen
horsemen
magnificently
mounted
and
bearing
the
insignia
of
the
king
formed
before
the
porch
of
my
host
their
commander
set
foot
to
the
ground
and
begged
me
with
a
very
low
salaam
to
mount
and
ride
it
would
be
his
privilege
he
said
to
hold
my
bridle
it
was
my
design
to
maintain
my
state
and
thus
in
great
pomp
was
i
led
through
the
busy
streets
till
i
came
to
a
vast
archway
all
emblazoned
with
holy
texts
passing
through
this
i
came
into
a
more
magnificent
court
than
i
had
thought
men
could
have
built
in
this
world
indeed
the
folk
had
made
stories
of
it
that
it
was
not
of
human
handicraft
but
that
its
delicate
piers
and
alabaster
columns
and
lovely
arches
lighter
and
lighter
as
they
rose
to
heaven
had
sprung
up
in
a
moment
at
the
command
of
spirits
in
the
days
of
soleiman
from
whom
the
monarchs
of
this
happy
island
claimed
descent
my
advent
was
greeted
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
as
though
i
were
some
sort
of
ambassador
such
an
effect
had
my
robes
and
jewels
and
letter
produced
and
without
delay
i
was
conducted
by
servants
of
the
palace
into
the
presence
of
the
council
the
morning
was
already
far
advanced
the
heat
increasing
but
the
apartment
in
which
i
found
myself
which
was
ablaze
with
the
most
costly
tiles
and
hangings
of
the
indies
was
very
cool
and
again
the
pleasant
sound
of
water
plashing
from
a
scented
fountain
refreshed
the
air
before
the
throne
stood
in
respectful
order
the
twelve
councillors
of
the
king
and
he
himself
upon
a
marble
throne
exquisite
in
workmanship
and
venerable
with
age
sat
a
young
man
of
a
dreamy
melancholy
but
pleasing
countenance
who
bowed
his
head
very
slightly
at
my
approach
smiled
gently
as
he
did
so
and
welcomed
me
such
was
the
king
i
in
my
turn
cast
myself
down
before
him
with
a
full
obeisance
until
he
bade
me
rise
our
business
was
not
long
in
concluding
the
grand
vizier
who
stepped
up
and
stood
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
put
me
certain
questions
whether
i
had
my
treasure
with
me
whether
i
could
produce
it
by
such
a
date
and
so
forth
i
satisfied
him
by
signalling
to
my
attendants
with
their
burdens
the
packages
were
opened
before
the
eyes
of
the
council
and
at
that
sitting
all
was
arranged
for
the
terms
which
i
proposed
were
discovered
suitable
enough
i
have
told
you
my
dear
nephews
and
i
do
confess
it
again
to
my
shame
that
desire
for
ease
had
now
taken
place
in
my
mind
whereas
further
gain
should
have
occupied
it
i
very
modestly
asked
for
no
more
than
five
dinars
yearly
on
the
hundred
i
told
the
council
and
his
majesty
that
for
the
million
dinars
which
could
here
be
counted
i
should
ask
annually
but
fifty
thousand
for
revenue
and
that
paid
on
such
dates
as
they
thought
fit
all
nodded
gravely
the
king
gently
complimented
me
upon
my
public
spirit
for
now
as
he
was
good
enough
to
say
he
regarded
me
as
a
subject
he
looked
round
among
his
councillors
as
though
seeking
a
suggestion
when
one
of
them
tarib
by
name
whom
i
distinguished
by
his
fine
intelligent
face
and
felt
drawn
towards
already
said
in
a
firm
voice
the
salt
tax
and
all
including
the
king
himself
murmured
approval
then
did
i
learn
that
for
many
generations
past
the
people
of
this
wealthy
and
fortunate
realm
had
paid
to
the
state
a
fixed
tax
upon
salt
which
amounted
yearly
upon
the
average
to
the
sum
i
had
demanded
it
was
regularly
received
for
all
the
salt
of
this
land
came
over
sea
and
the
toll
was
levied
at
the
ports
of
entry
a
charter
was
drawn
up
by
the
council
in
simple
terms
it
was
agreed
by
my
own
wish
that
my
name
should
not
be
published
to
the
people
lest
perhaps
the
odium
of
receiving
tribute
should
attach
to
one
so
recently
come
among
them
but
the
king
assured
me
as
he
signed
that
not
odium
but
gratitude
was
my
due
he
for
his
part
would
never
cease
to
believe
that
i
had
been
moved
to
make
so
generous
an
offer
by
some
particular
affection
for
himself
and
his
people
rooms
within
the
palace
were
set
at
my
disposal
until
i
should
have
time
to
choose
some
house
in
the
city
and
through
the
importance
of
my
connexion
with
the
state
i
was
sworn
of
the
council
with
the
rest
as
i
read
my
charter
through
all
alone
in
the
privacy
of
my
room
i
noted
with
pleasure
the
short
and
simple
phrasing
of
this
great
commercial
people
mahmoud
his
assignees
and
heirs
for
ever
and
ever
so
long
as
the
state
shall
last
and
the
salt
tax
be
ran
the
what
is
called
among
the
mighty
the
operative
clause
the
words
of
i
had
them
by
heart
in
a
moment
i
could
not
forbear
to
write
them
down
in
my
own
hand
more
than
once
for
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
here
then
was
my
every
wish
fulfilled
here
was
the
best
of
company
the
most
dignified
of
position
the
most
charming
of
climates
surroundings
of
wealth
luxury
and
ease
the
culture
of
a
thousand
years
all
that
our
religion
permits
in
art
and
entertainment
books
of
every
language
and
climate
stores
of
good
from
every
sky
under
heaven
from
every
people
and
of
every
age
here
indeed
might
i
live
my
life
without
further
adventure
or
negotiation
what
pleased
me
most
was
to
think
that
i
would
be
able
to
escape
some
little
strains
i
might
have
to
put
upon
my
honour
though
not
i
am
glad
to
say
upon
my
conscience
in
the
rude
struggle
of
the
outer
world
no
one
here
knew
my
humble
beginnings
or
in
too
much
detail
the
particular
abilities
whereby
i
had
so
rapidly
enriched
myself
i
was
now
one
of
the
great
lords
and
very
soon
the
foundation
of
my
fortune
would
be
lost
in
the
mists
of
time
men
would
easily
come
to
believe
that
my
fathers
had
acquired
it
sword
in
hand
when
first
the
banner
of
the
prophet
was
seen
upon
those
hills
three
hundred
years
before
i
will
not
detain
you
with
the
happy
disposition
of
my
time
nor
with
more
than
the
statement
of
my
supreme
enjoyment
scrolls
from
every
land
i
accumulated
in
my
library
i
had
about
me
the
most
costly
stuffs
and
upon
my
person
and
upon
those
of
my
attendants
the
rarest
gems
my
chief
delight
was
to
gather
at
my
table
a
small
but
various
band
of
intimates
chief
of
whom
was
that
earnest
intelligent
young
man
of
the
council
whom
i
noted
on
my
first
arrival
tarib
as
i
have
told
you
was
his
simple
name
and
i
learned
how
his
father
had
been
no
more
than
a
respected
merchant
in
offal
dying
he
had
left
his
son
a
sufficient
income
and
that
son
had
so
added
to
it
by
occasions
of
public
service
that
he
had
now
risen
to
one
of
the
highest
offices
of
state
it
was
his
special
function
in
the
council
to
represent
and
to
retail
to
the
king
whatever
popular
movement
was
abroad
for
he
was
known
to
every
class
in
the
city
he
was
the
intermediary
between
king
and
people
was
regarded
in
some
way
as
a
tribune
or
as
his
title
went
the
doubler
which
term
already
centuries
old
some
derived
from
his
double
function
others
from
the
attitude
which
etiquette
demanded
him
to
assume
to
monarch
and
subjects
alike
others
again
put
it
down
to
the
emoluments
of
his
post
through
him
i
learned
to
understand
this
kindly
industrious
and
most
loyal
people
in
my
walks
with
him
and
by
my
regular
attendance
at
his
public
addresses
i
grew
intimate
with
that
character
in
the
people
of
izmat
which
had
led
to
their
great
reputation
throughout
the
world
it
was
their
pride
that
they
never
shook
the
state
by
violent
change
but
with
gradual
and
reforms
adapted
themselves
generation
by
generation
to
the
movement
of
the
world
they
thought
disdainfully
of
nationalities
controlled
by
less
powerful
traditions
for
a
man
of
great
fortune
like
myself
it
was
therefore
an
thought
the
foundation
i
might
say
of
my
happiness
to
consider
the
peace
and
solidity
all
about
me
that
portion
of
the
populace
about
one
half
which
lay
upon
the
verge
of
starvation
were
manfully
content
with
their
lot
or
if
they
showed
some
beginning
of
complaint
were
at
once
appeased
when
they
had
pointed
out
to
them
their
superiority
over
the
miserable
foreigners
of
the
mainland
while
those
who
like
myself
were
possessed
of
vast
revenues
and
lived
in
great
palaces
were
far
too
devoted
to
the
commonwealth
to
dream
of
grumbling
at
their
lot
they
would
upon
the
contrary
frequently
express
their
devotion
to
state
and
king
and
prove
it
by
doing
for
the
common
weal
unpaid
as
much
as
three
hours
work
in
a
day
or
even
four
when
there
was
a
press
of
business
thus
one
would
maintain
the
magnificent
breed
of
horses
by
his
devotion
to
the
chase
another
would
support
the
industry
of
the
goldsmith
by
his
frequent
purchase
of
ornaments
another
would
as
a
local
magistrate
condemn
the
poorest
of
his
district
to
various
terms
of
imprisonment
another
though
in
no
way
bound
to
do
so
would
write
a
book
the
description
perhaps
of
his
tastes
in
food
or
a
recollection
of
those
men
and
women
of
the
wealthier
sort
whom
he
had
met
in
the
course
of
his
useful
life
yet
another
would
contribute
to
the
health
of
the
state
by
the
continual
practice
of
commerce
to
which
these
people
were
very
much
devoted
there
was
hardly
one
of
this
rich
class
in
which
i
now
mixed
but
had
his
chosen
work
thoroughly
accomplished
the
content
of
the
poor
the
public
spirit
of
the
rich
welded
the
whole
of
that
society
into
a
sort
of
paradise
but
most
noble
of
all
and
most
worthy
of
this
people
was
this
young
tribune
tarib
he
it
was
who
talked
most
incessantly
and
before
the
largest
gatherings
thus
creating
a
taste
for
public
discussion
he
it
was
who
discussed
practical
remedies
whenever
discontent
appeared
and
he
who
worked
out
every
detail
in
the
interesting
reports
upon
the
condition
of
the
starving
to
the
thousands
whom
he
addressed
his
manner
never
grew
stale
his
eloquence
was
sober
his
speeches
with
praise
of
izmat
and
quotations
from
the
sacred
books
as
also
with
known
jests
things
which
this
practical
people
infinitely
preferred
to
empty
theories
of
the
mainland
so
all
went
well
and
i
blind
to
the
future
alas
went
down
that
path
of
statesmanship
along
which
my
friend
led
me
little
knowing
whither
it
would
lead
me
i
did
not
often
speak
myself
at
the
public
meetings
so
frequently
held
they
were
indeed
the
noble
pastime
of
this
patriot
folk
lest
my
foreign
accent
should
hurt
my
dignity
for
i
had
not
yet
a
complete
command
of
the
language
though
it
was
now
two
years
since
i
had
become
a
citizen
and
subject
of
the
monarch
to
whom
we
were
all
so
devoted
but
i
would
sit
by
the
side
of
my
friend
tarib
and
others
as
they
harangued
the
populace
in
the
open
places
of
the
city
or
upon
occasions
in
the
mosques
on
such
occasions
i
would
show
by
my
smiles
and
applause
my
approval
of
all
that
was
said
for
the
betterment
of
the
poor
or
the
rich
as
the
case
might
be
and
i
always
laughed
at
the
ritual
jests
sometimes
even
before
they
were
delivered
in
this
way
i
grew
familiar
with
most
of
those
in
the
capital
and
with
many
of
the
provincial
towns
and
hoped
to
conquer
general
favour
i
was
present
when
ibn
rashn
delivered
his
great
harangue
to
a
vast
assembly
denouncing
the
foreign
practice
of
marrying
a
fifth
wife
which
abomination
there
was
some
danger
of
seeing
introduced
into
his
beloved
land
i
was
present
also
when
the
same
great
and
eloquent
man
gave
his
second
great
harangue
insisting
upon
the
necessity
of
fifth
wives
and
carrying
that
reform
by
acclamation
as
a
law
seated
with
others
on
the
raised
platform
which
surrounded
the
orator
i
applauded
the
grand
vizier
in
his
solemn
declaration
against
shaving
a
thing
said
he
abhorrent
to
every
true
believer
and
heard
the
sway
of
argument
for
and
against
the
custom
which
i
am
glad
to
say
was
afterwards
put
down
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
but
my
happiest
memories
are
still
of
those
numerous
days
when
my
intimate
the
tribune
tarib
who
could
never
be
accused
of
any
petty
thing
poured
forth
his
soul
upon
the
poverty
of
the
commons
and
extolled
to
them
the
national
pride
and
glory
of
doing
nothing
to
change
it
in
which
principles
he
was
applauded
with
frenzy
this
spirit
was
peculiar
to
this
happy
land
and
no
one
expressed
it
in
wiser
or
more
memorable
terms
than
he
who
was
now
my
bosom
friend
but
there
came
a
time
i
had
been
in
izmat
about
three
years
when
it
was
clearly
necessary
to
strike
a
new
note
there
was
at
the
moment
of
which
i
speak
some
little
commotion
in
the
city
on
account
of
a
dearth
of
rice
the
diet
of
the
poorer
classes
or
at
least
the
diet
of
the
poorer
classes
when
they
could
obtain
it
for
there
was
a
custom
deeply
rooted
in
this
conservative
people
that
when
the
poorer
classes
could
not
obtain
rice
they
should
do
without
it
at
this
juncture
the
difficulty
had
risen
to
the
middle
classes
and
these
joined
with
the
populace
ill
ease
grew
general
a
complaint
of
stringency
was
abroad
from
the
ranks
of
those
who
starved
to
death
up
to
the
merchants
and
the
lords
themselves
even
the
moderately
rich
could
no
longer
afford
the
services
of
more
than
a
dozen
dancing
girls
the
whole
island
was
in
a
ferment
and
the
capital
was
so
disturbed
that
one
might
have
thought
oneself
at
times
among
the
degraded
tribes
of
the
mainland
processions
had
appeared
in
the
streets
sometimes
actually
accompanied
by
musical
instruments
of
a
loud
and
distressing
order
banners
had
been
carried
and
upon
one
occasion
the
litter
of
no
less
a
person
than
the
lord
executioner
had
been
detained
for
half
an
hour
in
a
block
caused
by
the
multitudes
proceeding
to
hear
a
favourite
orator
the
council
had
taken
note
of
these
things
and
my
friend
the
tribune
tarib
the
lord
doubler
was
naturally
deputed
to
deal
with
them
in
his
own
inimitable
way
he
went
on
foot
to
the
vast
meeting
that
had
been
convened
in
the
mosque
of
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
we
also
went
with
him
thus
humbly
the
better
to
please
the
public
eye
with
some
dozen
others
of
my
rank
i
sat
upon
a
rug
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
orator
and
listened
entranced
to
his
impassioned
words
never
had
i
heard
him
more
inspired
it
was
a
great
volume
of
sound
the
words
in
which
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
often
meaningless
but
never
pedantic
and
throughout
the
speech
he
was
careful
to
interpolate
short
passages
which
the
meanest
intellect
could
clearly
follow
and
which
exactly
corresponded
to
the
desires
of
his
hearers
why
should
you
starve
cried
he
while
all
around
you
is
wealth
which
the
wealthy
will
be
the
first
to
murmurs
of
applause
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
treasurer
and
the
grand
vizier
while
i
myself
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
cried
aloud
in
my
enthusiasm
for
the
sentiment
why
said
he
do
you
lack
your
poor
pittance
of
rice
while
the
bloated
rich
and
he
looked
round
at
the
galleries
as
though
to
find
them
there
have
their
fill
of
the
tenderest
lamb
stuffed
with
pistachio
nuts
and
who
shall
blame
them
again
there
rose
a
wave
of
applause
in
which
i
joined
more
heartily
than
ever
for
the
words
reminded
me
of
that
delicious
viand
which
i
had
but
an
hour
before
very
plentifully
consumed
why
he
shouted
in
louder
tones
why
do
you
permit
yourselves
to
be
loaded
with
an
intolerable
burden
of
taxation
which
our
wealthier
classes
bear
also
in
an
immoderate
degree
at
this
phrase
the
exultation
of
the
lord
chief
treasurer
knew
no
bounds
and
he
led
the
stream
of
cheering
which
it
so
richly
deserved
how
long
are
we
to
wait
for
that
reform
which
our
fathers
especially
among
the
gentry
demanded
and
so
nearly
obtained
he
looked
round
upon
them
for
a
moment
in
a
dramatic
pause
and
then
said
in
solemn
tones
a
tax
upon
the
and
more
especially
yet
louder
upon
the
rich
and
more
especially
still
his
voice
now
booming
like
a
hammering
of
drums
upon
the
alien
rich
who
stand
fattening
upon
the
revenues
of
the
state
this
i
say
but
the
delirium
of
acquiescence
aroused
by
this
noble
sentiment
cut
off
the
rest
of
his
phrase
and
drowned
his
voice
for
the
space
in
which
a
man
might
recite
the
prayer
for
the
caliph
used
as
i
was
to
this
style
of
public
eloquence
and
the
expression
of
opinions
universal
to
this
happy
people
bound
up
as
i
thought
with
the
very
atmosphere
of
their
race
i
naturally
expected
that
when
the
dying
down
of
the
applause
should
have
allowed
him
to
be
heard
we
should
have
that
second
part
of
which
his
speeches
had
always
consisted
an
appeal
to
the
conservative
instincts
of
our
race
to
their
noble
patience
and
to
their
dogged
tenacity
in
doing
nothing
which
had
made
them
the
envy
of
their
neighbours
bitterly
was
i
undeceived
for
what
were
his
very
next
words
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
as
those
words
fell
upon
me
why
said
he
in
grave
and
tragic
tones
slowly
separating
them
syllable
by
syllable
why
do
you
thus
remain
ground
down
by
such
an
iniquity
as
the
tax
upon
salt
my
heart
stood
still
i
ventured
discreetly
to
touch
his
foot
with
that
one
of
my
own
which
was
nearest
he
replied
by
treading
heavily
upon
my
toe
which
i
interpreted
as
a
signal
of
secret
friendship
but
i
was
terribly
concerned
to
note
that
the
native
lords
around
squatted
upon
the
same
platform
as
myself
wagged
their
heads
in
unison
when
this
monstrous
suggestion
was
made
and
by
their
murmurs
of
agreement
interrupted
the
awful
silence
which
followed
that
silence
did
not
last
for
long
once
more
but
with
stronger
decision
with
larger
hope
there
arose
from
the
vast
assembly
the
same
tumult
of
applause
every
man
rose
to
his
feet
someone
began
to
sing
then
all
sang
in
unison
their
famous
hymn
which
asks
in
stirring
words
and
air
whether
one
hussein
shall
die
and
asserts
with
the
utmost
vehemence
that
if
this
most
unfortunate
event
should
come
to
pass
no
less
than
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
of
the
peninsula
province
of
would
demand
a
full
explanation
of
the
occurrence
the
words
might
not
seem
apposite
to
a
stranger
but
in
the
dignified
and
strongly
national
atmosphere
of
izmat
their
purport
is
well
understood
they
can
be
suited
to
almost
any
occasion
of
popular
passion
and
at
this
moment
most
undoubtedly
might
be
interpreted
to
mean
eblis
with
the
salt
i
was
by
this
time
frozen
to
my
marrow
i
was
bewildered
i
could
hardly
doubt
the
friendship
between
tarib
and
myself
i
had
shown
him
so
many
favours
even
now
as
i
looked
at
him
i
found
him
very
sympathetic
and
so
familiar
i
could
not
doubt
the
force
of
familiar
converse
i
could
not
doubt
my
hosts
and
colleagues
the
councillors
who
had
for
now
three
years
sat
with
me
round
his
majesty
in
divan
and
worked
with
me
as
one
of
the
chief
ministers
there
the
next
words
slightly
but
only
slightly
reassured
me
they
were
more
after
the
style
i
knew
so
well
when
in
the
past
the
national
glory
in
doing
nothing
had
been
expressed
with
peculiar
skill
the
lord
doubler
assumed
a
piteous
expression
and
his
mouth
the
shape
of
which
might
now
be
compared
to
that
of
a
horseshoe
opened
let
me
not
stir
you
up
my
friends
said
he
to
a
violent
anger
we
can
leave
froth
and
vindictive
folly
to
the
pitiful
peoples
of
the
mainland
we
in
izmat
thanks
be
to
allah
will
never
lose
our
dignity
in
mere
brawling
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
constitutional
means
the
only
ones
whereby
anything
practical
can
be
applause
also
met
these
sentiments
more
subdued
indeed
than
that
which
we
had
first
heard
but
sincere
my
friends
around
me
and
he
smiled
on
all
the
councillors
including
myself
will
deliberate
as
we
always
do
for
the
public
good
and
you
will
find
that
our
recommendations
thus
laid
before
his
majesty
with
the
ensuing
proclamation
will
be
the
beginning
of
better
things
we
can
not
say
that
all
this
evil
shall
be
redressed
at
once
we
are
a
practical
people
as
i
think
i
have
remarked
before
you
have
indeed
cried
to
me
for
redress
but
we
are
i
say
it
again
a
practical
people
we
do
not
attempt
the
impossible
or
tear
up
the
ancient
framework
of
our
state
step
by
step
is
our
motto
one
thing
at
a
time
the
advance
of
his
majesty
s
subjects
in
freedom
and
happiness
has
increased
in
breadth
by
imperceptible
degrees
from
one
decision
in
the
past
to
another
as
our
great
poet
has
so
admirably
put
it
and
again
not
once
or
twice
in
the
far
from
smooth
sequence
of
our
insular
activities
has
the
mere
fulfilment
of
our
daily
tasks
proved
an
approach
to
these
verses
which
in
the
original
form
noble
lines
of
poetry
made
a
fitting
conclusion
to
one
of
those
great
speeches
which
from
time
to
time
determined
the
fate
of
izmat
we
all
rose
the
audience
and
the
councillors
and
the
orator
himself
united
in
chanting
that
portion
of
the
koran
which
details
mahomet
s
visit
to
the
moon
a
religious
exercise
dear
to
this
folk
we
then
sang
an
invocation
to
allah
that
he
might
protect
his
majesty
the
king
and
throw
any
hypothetical
enemies
of
that
monarch
into
the
utmost
confusion
then
we
filed
out
of
the
mosque
in
our
thousands
to
the
coolness
of
the
declining
day
that
great
that
historic
that
fatal
meeting
had
occupied
four
hours
the
council
was
immediately
summoned
and
their
first
action
after
their
obeisance
to
the
king
upon
his
throne
was
to
assure
me
individual
by
individual
that
no
idea
of
any
attack
upon
me
had
been
for
one
moment
intended
it
is
my
dear
mahmoud
said
the
grand
vizier
placing
his
hand
familiarly
upon
mine
as
it
lay
listless
upon
my
knee
it
is
the
of
the
matter
which
we
must
consider
that
is
he
pressed
my
hand
on
the
other
side
for
yourself
mahmoud
as
you
know
we
have
a
respect
which
exceeds
all
bounds
but
we
must
move
with
the
times
things
are
not
what
they
were
evolution
is
better
than
revolution
if
we
do
not
reform
ourselves
things
will
reform
us
mend
it
or
end
it
what
did
the
sultan
omar
say
in
the
year
of
the
flight
of
the
prophet
these
commonplaces
fell
mournfully
upon
my
ears
i
made
no
attempt
to
reply
his
majesty
was
pleased
to
say
a
few
sympathetic
words
the
tribune
tarib
who
evidently
felt
embarrassed
by
my
position
and
by
his
memories
of
our
past
friendship
most
earnestly
protested
that
his
whole
object
had
been
to
stem
the
growing
dangerous
demand
nay
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
perilous
demand
nay
more
a
minatory
demand
yea
a
threatening
demand
had
he
not
stemmed
the
demand
as
he
had
it
would
have
had
tremendous
consequences
in
the
way
of
demand
the
great
lord
whose
special
function
on
the
council
was
solemnity
and
who
was
known
by
the
title
of
his
impressiveness
opened
his
mouth
in
the
midst
of
his
prodigious
beard
to
say
that
he
thoroughly
agreed
with
these
sentiments
for
my
part
i
said
nothing
but
sat
mournfully
seeing
no
issue
and
attending
the
pleasure
of
those
who
could
do
what
they
would
with
me
and
mine
i
heard
their
debate
i
was
asked
to
sign
their
conclusions
i
did
so
with
a
reluctant
unwilling
hand
and
as
i
signed
my
name
in
its
place
and
affixed
my
seal
i
glanced
at
the
wording
of
the
proclamation
and
felt
some
relief
to
discover
that
the
salt
tax
was
not
abolished
but
only
halved
while
the
loss
so
occasioned
was
to
be
made
good
by
a
tax
upon
revenue
of
one
dinar
in
each
hundred
a
very
moderate
amount
after
this
dreadful
session
the
date
will
remain
engraved
upon
my
soul
to
my
dying
day
it
was
the
anniversary
of
the
day
upon
which
my
grandfather
your
great
grandfather
dear
boys
had
been
hanged
i
paced
up
and
down
in
my
courtyard
alone
no
longer
soothed
by
the
ceaseless
whisper
of
my
beloved
fountains
in
no
mood
for
taking
down
any
one
of
my
famous
scrolls
nor
even
for
toying
with
the
numerous
circassians
whom
i
had
imported
at
vast
expense
during
the
preceding
months
my
bosom
and
my
brow
were
contracted
and
i
was
weary
of
life
but
after
some
hours
of
these
mournful
reflections
some
considerations
of
hope
occurred
to
me
after
all
said
i
to
myself
there
must
be
ups
and
downs
many
a
man
has
lost
a
fortune
and
recovered
it
my
income
is
halved
but
what
remains
is
still
i
could
yet
call
myself
an
extremely
wealthy
man
among
the
wealthiest
in
the
state
the
small
tax
put
upon
my
revenue
i
could
not
grudge
since
it
fell
also
upon
the
revenues
of
others
but
i
was
to
learn
what
bitter
truth
there
lay
behind
the
boast
of
these
people
that
they
proceeded
step
by
step
slowly
one
thing
at
a
time
etc
not
a
month
had
passed
but
a
modification
was
issued
to
the
first
regulation
and
it
was
ordained
in
view
of
certain
rumours
which
had
been
heard
in
the
that
the
tax
on
revenue
should
be
of
a
more
complicated
kind
it
was
to
indeed
at
one
dinar
in
the
hundred
but
since
it
was
harsh
to
apply
even
this
small
burden
to
the
poorer
citizens
only
those
receiving
at
least
one
thousand
dinars
should
pay
and
the
proportion
was
to
rise
rapidly
with
the
larger
fortunes
until
for
such
a
man
as
myself
the
proportion
reached
one
quarter
of
the
total
but
worse
was
to
come
yielding
to
the
vigorous
popular
clamour
the
tax
was
doubled
for
those
of
alien
birth
for
those
whose
income
was
derived
in
any
way
from
the
revenues
of
state
the
tax
was
doubled
again
exception
was
made
for
the
councillors
for
so
ran
the
proclamation
their
salaries
are
paid
by
his
majesty
and
a
diminution
of
them
would
but
take
money
with
one
hand
to
give
it
back
to
the
other
i
hoped
for
one
wild
moment
that
i
should
come
within
so
clear
a
category
but
no
in
a
further
clause
it
was
specially
indicated
that
this
should
apply
only
to
salaries
actually
paid
by
the
treasury
and
not
to
annuities
guaranteed
by
or
derived
from
the
public
revenue
directly
and
my
payment
alone
was
of
this
kind
in
all
the
council
still
more
was
to
follow
an
infamous
new
regulation
appeared
whereby
a
man
should
pay
not
upon
that
which
he
actually
received
but
upon
that
which
he
had
received
in
the
course
of
three
years
a
space
of
time
exactly
corresponding
to
my
presence
in
the
island
and
attaching
to
my
vast
income
of
the
past
it
was
clear
that
i
was
ruined
i
made
a
brief
calculation
on
the
night
after
the
last
of
these
official
acts
had
been
published
after
taking
this
survey
of
my
remaining
wealth
i
had
already
sold
the
most
part
of
my
movables
and
had
removed
from
my
great
palace
to
a
humble
lodging
i
discovered
that
i
had
left
in
my
hands
all
told
less
than
one
thousand
dinars
i
knew
not
how
to
look
upon
the
world
my
whole
being
seemed
to
have
departed
i
watched
the
day
fading
and
with
it
faded
my
spirit
i
returned
to
my
poor
room
and
very
late
lost
or
my
miseries
in
an
imperfect
the
old
man
concluded
and
bowed
his
head
in
a
solemn
silence
his
young
nephews
appreciating
how
sacred
a
thing
is
death
especially
the
death
of
money
glided
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
and
vanished
الوكلاء
that

the

chapter
vi
entitled
or
the
lawyers
when
the
nephews
next
entered
their
uncle
s
presence
at
the
hour
of
public
executions
it
was
in
a
subdued
manner
as
to
a
funeral
for
their
thoughts
were
full
of
that
great
loss
the
story
of
which
was
in
progress
they
sat
upon
the
floor
before
him
in
due
order
and
mahmoud
began
upon
the
dawn
that
followed
that
hopeless
night
my
hopes
were
again
raised
only
for
my
further
bitterness
and
disappointment
i
had
risen
before
day
and
gone
out
of
doors
a
chance
acquaintance
ran
across
me
as
i
paced
aimlessly
in
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
watching
the
shadows
shortening
under
the
rising
sun
listening
to
the
clear
voices
of
the
and
to
the
cries
of
the
mariners
at
their
calling
this
acquaintance
was
one
learned
in
the
law
not
that
he
was
himself
a
scrivener
or
pleader
still
less
a
judge
on
the
contrary
he
was
born
wealthy
and
those
so
circumstanced
are
in
izmat
very
much
averse
to
the
tedium
of
a
profession
but
in
youth
he
had
been
compelled
by
his
grandfather
to
read
whole
libraries
of
books
upon
the
legal
system
of
his
beloved
country
and
had
further
been
compelled
to
pay
considerable
sums
to
one
of
the
most
renowned
pleaders
of
the
day
in
whose
office
he
had
passed
three
miserable
years
seeing
he
was
so
educated
and
knowing
well
my
misfortunes
he
kindly
took
me
by
the
arm
i
could
not
help
suspecting
a
certain
patronage
and
said
alas
my
poor
mahmoud
how
we
do
all
feel
for
you
and
how
we
respect
the
way
in
which
you
have
borne
inevitable
misfortune
but
though
i
praise
you
as
much
as
any
other
for
your
conduct
and
resignation
do
you
not
push
it
a
little
too
far
we
the
free
inhabitants
of
this
our
beloved
izmat
have
a
most
glorious
privilege
which
is
that
not
the
king
himself
the
glory
of
allah
be
upon
him
has
any
privilege
as
against
the
humblest
of
his
subjects
when
it
comes
to
the
issue
of
law
our
judges
as
you
know
stand
above
all
mortal
frailty
and
are
as
we
devoutly
and
firmly
believe
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
himself
though
his
majesty
and
his
ministers
be
your
opponents
in
a
case
that
case
will
be
decided
with
serene
indifference
to
the
position
or
wealth
or
power
of
the
parties
you
believe
this
do
you
not
he
insisted
earnestly
for
doubts
upon
so
final
a
doctrine
of
religion
are
horrible
to
the
imperial
race
of
izmat
yes
i
believe
it
said
i
with
a
sigh
though
i
confess
that
my
short
acquaintance
with
misfortune
had
shaken
me
in
many
points
of
loyalty
to
my
new
country
why
then
said
he
do
you
not
come
into
court
with
your
plaint
our
lawyers
have
the
skill
to
discover
a
claim
in
anything
and
you
may
be
sure
that
all
that
can
be
said
in
your
favour
would
be
allowed
in
the
freest
manner
and
if
there
is
a
single
loophole
the
whole
or
part
of
your
former
fortunes
may
be
restored
at
whatever
cost
for
it
is
a
maxim
peculiar
to
our
island
law
that
if
a
case
is
decided
in
favour
of
the
plaintiff
then
the
plaintiff
has
the
decision
in
his
i
confess
that
my
acquaintance
with
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
foreign
people
among
whom
i
had
had
the
wretched
luck
to
be
born
had
made
me
think
it
futile
indeed
to
approach
the
august
judges
in
a
matter
where
a
king
was
concerned
or
to
ask
relief
from
state
officials
for
what
the
state
had
done
to
me
he
stoutly
denied
the
idea
i
had
that
the
judges
were
state
officials
said
he
have
you
never
read
the
famous
oath
which
every
judge
makes
on
taking
office
do
you
not
know
how
we
elect
him
yes
said
i
in
tones
which
betrayed
no
enthusiasm
i
know
indeed
how
the
judges
are
appointed
and
the
oath
they
take
they
are
appointed
how
often
have
i
not
seen
the
firman
signed
in
council
how
often
have
i
not
affixed
my
own
poor
name
to
it
they
are
appointed
as
the
rule
goes
his
sacred
majesty
that
is
by
the
familiars
the
wives
and
the
secretaries
of
the
richest
men
such
are
the
very
words
of
the
you
answer
rightly
said
my
friend
with
a
noble
carriage
of
his
head
surely
so
impartial
a
source
of
office
must
make
you
feel
secure
on
the
odious
mainland
the
king
appoints
his
own
judges
it
is
a
tyranny
to
which
we
in
izmat
have
long
refused
to
submit
monarch
is
the
ruler
of
free
men
he
would
disdain
to
influence
an
appointment
he
leaves
that
to
his
gentry
and
they
in
turn
leave
it
to
their
women
and
other
dependents
thus
we
alone
of
all
nations
secure
a
bench
of
judges
wholly
independent
but
there
is
more
have
you
forgotten
the
oath
they
take
my
friend
the
oath
they
take
on
appointment
no
said
i
still
wearily
i
remember
it
well
enough
indeed
i
have
it
all
by
heart
for
i
have
read
it
a
hundred
times
swear
by
the
almighty
god
and
by
the
contents
of
this
book
that
i
will
not
depart
from
justice
in
anything
either
for
orders
or
favours
or
personal
advantage
or
any
consideration
whatsoever
save
in
the
political
interests
of
my
class
or
family
of
the
lawyers
guild
to
which
i
belong
or
for
such
other
considerations
as
may
occur
to
that
is
right
said
my
friend
in
triumphant
tones
well
can
you
want
a
better
guarantee
no
said
i
i
suppose
well
then
he
cried
rising
let
me
take
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
among
the
most
able
scriveners
of
the
city
and
be
assured
that
whatever
can
be
done
for
you
will
be
i
have
no
great
part
of
my
fortune
left
said
i
timidly
rising
as
he
did
but
unwilling
to
follow
him
fear
nothing
he
returned
heartily
justice
in
izmat
is
not
bought
and
sold
there
are
of
course
certain
necessary
fees
but
the
law
compels
you
to
hire
no
pleader
you
can
appear
yourself
in
court
that
freedom
is
one
of
our
great
privileges
and
believe
me
you
will
be
heard
as
patiently
and
directed
as
honestly
as
though
you
were
one
of
the
greatest
pleaders
in
the
half
persuaded
by
such
insistence
i
followed
my
friend
to
a
house
where
seated
in
the
midst
of
commentaries
upon
the
law
of
metal
boxes
containing
the
shameful
secrets
of
great
families
and
the
record
of
their
indebtedness
sat
an
elderly
man
whose
face
reminded
me
i
know
not
why
of
a
vulture
i
have
brought
you
kazib
said
he
a
client
you
will
recognize
him
i
i
do
indeed
said
the
scrivener
rising
gravely
and
bowing
to
me
he
is
no
less
than
my
lord
the
councillor
the
title
is
superfluous
now
said
i
a
little
sadly
the
scrivener
however
continued
to
give
it
to
me
in
his
great
courtesy
and
when
my
friend
had
left
us
together
i
poured
out
my
story
as
the
more
important
details
fell
from
my
lips
my
host
jotted
them
down
upon
a
small
tablet
with
a
fine
quill
that
he
carried
when
i
had
concluded
he
spoke
as
follows
such
a
case
as
yours
would
appear
first
in
the
court
of
of
sweetmeats
said
i
it
is
an
old
term
said
he
we
love
these
historic
exactly
i
answered
humbly
well
it
would
appear
i
say
in
the
court
of
yes
said
i
after
it
had
gone
to
the
court
of
sweetmeats
it
would
almost
certainly
be
transferred
to
the
court
of
wrecks
lighthouses
and
divorce
or
to
the
department
of
indeed
said
i
it
is
so
said
the
scrivener
whichever
of
these
dealt
with
it
an
appeal
would
lie
of
course
to
a
superior
court
which
is
generally
known
as
the
court
of
why
is
i
began
oh
sir
interrupted
the
scrivener
with
some
impatience
these
things
are
immaterial
we
must
use
such
historic
names
from
this
court
again
the
appeal
would
lie
of
course
to
his
majesty
in
council
which
is
the
supreme
authority
of
the
what
said
i
to
his
majesty
in
council
the
very
authors
of
the
injustice
of
course
said
the
scrivener
but
said
i
if
the
verdict
is
in
my
favour
what
reason
should
i
have
for
appealing
none
said
he
simply
but
your
opponents
my
opponents
are
the
king
and
his
council
said
i
in
quite
another
aspect
said
the
scrivener
looking
on
the
ground
and
falling
silent
under
these
circumstances
said
he
after
a
pause
you
will
do
very
well
to
but
said
i
in
case
these
appeals
he
waved
his
hands
we
will
not
talk
of
appeals
yet
he
said
quickly
after
all
you
lose
nothing
by
first
instance
have
you
your
charter
with
you
i
said
i
had
and
brought
it
out
for
him
he
read
it
slowly
consulted
a
book
for
a
moment
and
then
said
an
excellent
case
you
may
judge
my
dear
nephews
how
my
heart
leapt
at
these
words
an
excellent
case
you
have
your
charter
and
its
terms
are
clear
by
it
there
is
bound
to
be
paid
to
you
and
your
heirs
for
ever
the
revenue
from
the
salt
tax
and
the
issue
will
lie
i
think
upon
whether
the
clause
implies
payment
undiminished
and
perpetual
or
whether
the
recent
proclamations
make
a
of
the
a
what
said
i
it
is
a
legal
term
said
he
a
little
wearily
and
signifies
a
or
general
contortation
but
let
us
not
at
this
stage
go
into
technicalities
of
that
sort
we
must
first
state
our
precisely
said
i
my
own
fee
said
he
is
fixed
by
statute
and
i
must
ask
you
for
ten
dinars
a
nominal
with
this
before
i
could
stop
him
he
seized
a
large
metal
disc
wet
a
corner
of
a
parchment
put
the
disc
upon
it
struck
it
with
a
hammer
and
then
held
out
his
hand
for
the
fee
luckily
i
had
my
pouch
with
me
and
so
very
reluctantly
paid
over
this
first
drop
of
my
disastrous
leakage
good
said
the
scrivener
we
must
next
ask
the
opinion
of
two
eminent
why
said
i
the
law
demands
it
said
the
scrivener
but
you
have
already
given
me
yours
and
told
me
it
is
worth
my
while
to
my
opinion
said
the
scrivener
shaking
his
head
vigorously
may
serve
to
guide
you
indeed
but
it
would
be
altogether
irregular
to
go
into
court
upon
that
alone
so
i
will
draw
up
a
statement
as
we
call
it
and
have
it
put
before
two
men
of
the
first
standing
it
is
always
better
in
these
cases
to
use
the
highest
talent
in
the
long
run
it
is
worth
i
asked
timidly
how
much
this
further
step
would
cost
and
was
somewhat
relieved
to
learn
that
fifty
dinars
to
each
of
these
eminent
men
would
be
sufficient
he
asked
me
to
return
on
the
third
day
when
he
would
give
me
the
responses
and
he
particularly
reminded
me
that
i
should
upon
that
occasion
not
forget
to
bring
with
me
at
least
dinars
but
why
the
other
fifty
said
i
stamps
and
fees
said
the
scrivener
shortly
and
then
with
infinite
courtesy
dismissed
me
from
his
presence
on
the
third
day
i
returned
bearing
with
me
the
dinars
from
my
little
hoard
which
i
put
upon
the
scrivener
s
table
to
save
all
further
difficulties
in
the
matter
he
poured
the
money
meditatively
into
a
little
metal
case
beautifully
engraved
and
dating
i
should
say
from
the
second
century
of
the
flight
of
the
prophet
it
was
probably
to
my
practised
eye
of
syrian
workmanship
here
said
he
are
the
have
you
them
written
said
i
no
said
he
we
must
wait
for
that
the
first
pleader
by
name
the
most
noble
ghadder
is
of
the
opinion
that
you
have
a
case
founded
upon
the
great
principle
of
our
common
law
of
which
you
perhaps
as
a
foreigner
have
not
heard
it
is
the
principle
that
the
subjects
of
the
king
can
suffer
no
but
he
warns
you
against
relying
upon
the
statute
passed
in
the
first
year
of
his
majesty
s
father
s
reign
called
a
statute
for
the
prevention
of
the
loss
of
money
by
the
for
this
has
been
the
subject
of
so
many
contradictory
decisions
that
it
is
a
very
poor
ground
he
says
further
that
there
are
certain
case
precedents
which
are
interesting
and
two
of
which
at
least
in
his
judgment
could
be
urged
upon
your
side
in
one
of
these
it
was
decided
that
if
a
man
had
more
than
a
certain
income
no
order
or
proclamation
should
be
regarded
as
capable
of
prejudicing
him
or
reducing
his
wealth
the
question
would
thus
lie
as
to
whether
or
no
at
the
time
when
the
first
change
took
place
you
fell
within
these
limits
the
second
pleader
is
of
an
exactly
opposite
opinion
he
says
it
is
enough
said
i
the
first
learned
pleader
shall
be
my
guide
i
am
content
to
hear
from
him
that
i
have
a
good
case
which
doubtless
he
will
continue
for
me
in
what
said
the
scrivener
in
astonishment
do
you
suppose
that
such
men
lend
their
valuable
services
in
court
for
fifty
dinars
evidently
said
i
as
they
have
been
so
kind
as
to
give
opinions
with
such
nicety
the
scrivener
laughed
as
heartily
as
such
men
can
and
begged
me
to
be
disabused
these
are
but
the
formal
stages
the
hiring
of
pleaders
is
quite
another
matter
let
me
proceed
to
the
second
response
the
second
pleader
the
most
noble
makhar
who
it
may
interest
you
to
know
is
a
negro
by
descent
we
have
many
such
at
our
bar
they
have
marvellous
abilities
that
strange
race
is
of
an
opinion
i
say
exactly
contrary
to
the
other
he
thinks
your
chance
under
the
common
law
very
doubtful
but
he
thinks
you
are
secure
under
the
statute
passed
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
the
important
that
is
its
general
title
dated
from
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
his
majesty
s
late
father
all
the
cases
he
says
are
against
you
but
the
general
principle
of
the
statute
when
i
had
heard
all
this
i
said
oh
the
old
scrivener
gazed
down
at
the
floor
between
his
feet
where
he
sat
upon
his
rug
and
i
gazed
down
at
mine
not
knowing
what
next
to
say
my
fee
for
this
second
interview
said
he
pleasantly
after
what
he
thought
was
a
sufficient
interval
is
the
same
as
for
the
first
ten
i
have
not
brought
them
with
me
i
said
having
only
brought
the
dinars
previously
asked
for
it
is
nothing
my
lord
he
answered
waving
his
hand
majestically
and
again
i
thought
as
in
the
case
of
my
friend
with
a
touch
of
patronage
we
all
know
and
respect
your
position
of
late
councillor
and
i
should
be
the
last
to
press
i
begged
him
to
wait
a
moment
until
i
should
return
i
hurried
to
my
wretched
lodgings
and
quickly
came
back
with
the
sum
which
he
required
he
put
it
into
the
little
metal
box
i
thought
he
was
ready
to
dismiss
me
and
i
was
about
to
ask
on
what
date
the
case
might
first
be
tried
when
he
said
to
my
surprise
but
we
must
first
have
pleader
s
but
great
heavens
said
i
have
we
not
got
it
why
no
said
he
we
have
not
yet
a
pleader
s
opinion
we
have
so
far
only
the
opinion
of
and
what
in
the
name
of
fatimeh
and
katisha
is
the
difference
surely
said
he
you
have
heard
of
the
distinction
the
opinion
of
pleaders
is
the
verbal
response
to
the
scrivener
but
the
law
requires
that
another
response
shall
be
added
in
writing
and
this
we
call
pleader
s
once
more
i
could
find
no
other
commentary
but
a
cry
and
at
what
cost
i
moaned
in
a
hollow
voice
he
turned
to
a
written
list
of
fees
then
to
a
special
memorandum
of
his
own
he
made
a
short
calculation
upon
an
abacus
and
answered
three
hundred
i
kept
my
mouth
from
blasphemy
and
asked
him
when
the
sum
would
be
required
it
is
a
mere
formality
said
he
this
written
opinion
but
we
must
have
a
yes
yes
said
i
and
i
will
said
he
take
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
the
same
before
you
come
once
more
i
returned
to
my
disgusting
rooms
took
money
from
my
secret
hoard
and
returning
put
into
the
scrivener
s
hands
a
little
parcel
of
dinars
he
dropped
them
thoughtfully
through
his
fingers
in
little
streams
till
they
nearly
filled
his
metal
box
it
is
a
pretty
box
is
it
not
he
said
i
took
it
for
a
bad
debt
from
one
of
my
clients
who
most
unfortunately
died
by
his
own
hand
in
a
fit
of
melancholy
after
the
most
distressing
disappointments
in
his
suits
at
and
as
to
the
date
i
said
the
date
once
more
he
consulted
another
document
then
clapped
his
hands
for
the
slave
who
sat
in
his
outer
apartment
and
having
asked
him
a
question
in
some
incomprehensible
jargon
received
an
answer
no
less
mysterious
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
it
will
come
on
at
some
date
after
the
next
new
moon
but
can
not
i
have
a
precise
date
said
i
for
i
was
thinking
anxiously
of
my
diminishing
capital
and
wondering
how
long
i
could
maintain
my
poor
life
before
my
cash
should
be
completely
exhausted
that
is
obviously
impossible
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
indignation
which
he
evidently
thought
merited
no
man
can
say
how
long
the
cases
before
yours
will
last
nor
in
what
order
it
may
please
his
holiness
the
judge
to
take
them
it
will
probably
come
by
the
way
said
he
peering
at
another
list
before
his
holiness
with
that
i
left
him
and
waited
my
call
to
the
court
the
time
dragged
wearily
enough
i
ate
most
sparingly
and
bought
no
raiment
nor
even
any
game
to
pass
my
time
but
my
little
stock
dwindled
day
by
day
my
hours
were
spent
gazing
upon
the
busy
life
of
the
port
or
sometimes
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
pier
and
staring
out
to
sea
as
though
i
could
read
in
the
distant
mainland
beyond
the
horizon
some
hopes
of
a
better
fortune
and
a
life
restored
daily
as
the
time
approached
for
my
case
to
be
heard
as
the
second
new
moon
grew
with
every
evening
brighter
in
the
last
of
its
crescent
i
consulted
officials
of
the
court
i
discovered
it
was
customary
to
give
each
some
small
sum
of
five
or
six
dinars
before
they
would
answer
a
question
it
was
upon
the
twelfth
day
the
moon
being
nearly
full
that
the
case
before
mine
which
turned
upon
whether
a
man
without
means
should
owe
for
a
debt
or
should
postpone
payment
and
had
lasted
five
exciting
days
was
concluded
i
heard
that
the
precedent
created
was
of
the
first
importance
but
would
be
subject
to
appeal
the
sun
sank
it
was
with
the
morrow
that
my
case
was
to
be
called
i
rose
on
that
eventful
day
long
before
dawn
i
put
on
my
raiment
with
the
utmost
care
after
having
cleansed
it
with
my
own
hands
to
make
it
as
presentable
as
possible
lest
the
poverty
of
my
appearance
should
in
some
way
prejudice
me
i
had
already
given
notice
that
i
would
appear
myself
for
the
fees
asked
by
the
pleaders
were
quite
beyond
the
poor
remnant
of
my
purse
i
must
confess
that
i
had
been
strongly
dissuaded
from
such
action
but
i
had
no
choice
i
found
a
great
crowd
assembled
for
my
name
was
familiar
to
all
through
the
position
i
had
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
it
is
ever
of
an
absorbing
interest
to
watch
the
miseries
of
another
i
took
my
seat
at
a
place
reserved
for
me
immediately
opposite
the
bench
i
noted
on
my
right
the
pleaders
chosen
by
the
council
and
beyond
among
the
spectators
not
a
few
of
my
former
colleagues
the
pleaders
were
arranged
in
the
vestments
proper
to
their
great
function
resembling
the
priests
of
a
religion
and
bearing
upon
their
heads
i
noticed
what
they
never
showed
outside
a
strange
headgear
of
mule
skin
with
twisted
hair
and
long
furry
ears
the
judge
i
saw
was
clothed
in
the
most
magnificent
cloth
of
gold
inscribed
with
the
sacred
texts
and
loaded
with
furs
of
such
rare
animals
as
the
sacred
rat
the
white
jackal
of
thibet
and
the
skunk
and
bore
upon
his
head
a
crown
which
he
lifted
three
times
as
a
salute
to
the
court
while
all
fell
prostrate
before
him
murmuring
in
a
buzz
of
low
prayerful
whispers
their
praise
and
incantation
to
him
as
the
representative
of
god
these
ceremonies
concluded
there
was
a
bustle
of
men
rising
and
taking
their
seats
upon
the
rugs
of
the
court
the
judge
himself
upon
a
sort
of
throne
overlooking
the
whole
and
the
proceedings
began
a
short
man
stood
in
front
of
the
judge
s
throne
who
rose
and
piped
in
a
shrill
voice
mahmoud
claims
against
the
he
then
sat
down
and
from
sundry
pushes
and
jerks
which
i
received
from
my
friends
including
the
scrivener
who
was
kind
enough
to
accompany
me
to
the
court
i
saw
that
i
was
expected
to
rise
from
my
carpet
and
put
my
case
i
said
your
holiness
and
voice
of
god
for
such
is
the
formula
required
as
a
kind
friend
had
warned
me
and
if
one
word
be
omitted
the
culprit
is
not
only
forbidden
to
plead
but
is
thrust
into
a
dungeon
of
the
most
noisome
kind
your
holiness
i
opened
and
voice
of
god
i
had
from
the
king
and
his
councillors
a
charter
it
was
given
me
as
against
one
million
dinars
paid
to
them
in
gold
by
me
on
such
and
such
a
date
i
shall
show
the
charter
to
you
and
you
will
see
there
the
promise
that
i
am
to
receive
as
against
the
payment
i
made
the
revenue
from
the
salt
tax
for
ever
and
ever
so
long
as
the
state
shall
endure
and
the
tax
be
levied
this
tax
has
been
in
great
part
remitted
and
by
special
imposts
the
remaining
part
has
been
wiped
out
i
claim
that
this
charter
gives
me
the
right
to
the
original
revenue
from
the
state
in
and
i
then
concluded
with
the
magic
formula
with
which
my
friends
had
very
kindly
provided
me
that
divine
one
is
my
this
formality
completed
i
sat
down
i
flattered
myself
i
had
done
well
for
all
had
been
told
with
perfect
ease
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
but
before
i
took
my
place
upon
my
carpet
i
handed
up
to
those
who
served
the
bench
my
original
of
the
charter
signed
and
sealed
the
which
i
had
consulted
the
judge
rose
from
the
throne
where
he
was
seated
put
the
charter
down
carefully
upon
his
throne
sat
upon
it
and
ordered
the
case
to
proceed
in
the
chief
of
the
pleaders
upon
the
other
side
i
was
pleased
to
see
an
old
guest
of
mine
he
nodded
to
me
familiarly
rose
and
opened
his
statement
beginning
as
i
did
with
the
ritual
phrase
your
holiness
and
voice
of
god
said
he
his
majesty
and
council
have
instructed
me
i
admit
that
this
is
a
case
of
peculiar
subtlety
and
difficulty
nor
do
i
doubt
that
it
will
employ
many
of
my
colleagues
not
only
in
this
court
but
in
superior
courts
for
many
months
to
come
indeed
to
my
certain
knowledge
one
of
them
has
recently
purchased
a
marvellous
vehicle
which
travels
rapidly
of
its
own
act
without
horses
a
foreign
invention
in
which
he
would
not
have
invested
had
he
not
foreseen
the
lengthy
and
lucrative
nature
of
the
case
but
that
is
by
the
way
i
only
mention
it
in
order
to
make
your
holiness
understand
that
we
have
here
to
settle
an
issue
which
indeed
could
hardly
have
been
brought
before
any
judge
less
divine
than
there
followed
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
fine
passage
upon
the
majesty
of
the
law
and
the
peculiar
gifts
and
virtues
of
the
judges
but
through
the
whole
of
it
he
insisted
in
every
second
sentence
upon
the
gravity
of
the
case
and
its
difficulty
i
was
flattered
and
surprised
i
had
not
thought
that
my
opponents
would
make
so
much
of
me
but
on
the
other
hand
i
remembered
that
their
payment
was
at
the
charge
of
the
public
and
that
every
day
added
to
the
sum
they
received
he
next
touched
upon
the
folly
of
the
salt
tax
its
iniquity
its
its
absurdity
and
after
an
hour
of
this
paused
a
moment
to
pull
down
and
smooth
the
long
furry
ears
of
his
headgear
in
the
second
hour
he
brought
in
the
very
words
of
the
charter
he
first
recited
them
ever
and
for
ever
so
long
as
the
state
shall
endure
and
the
salt
tax
be
he
insisted
with
repeated
emphasis
upon
the
word
in
the
third
and
fourth
hours
he
quoted
instances
of
cases
in
which
this
word
had
completely
changed
the
character
of
a
document
as
for
instance
in
the
famous
case
known
as
abraham
s
will
where
the
testator
left
all
his
property
to
his
beloved
wife
fatimah
the
remainder
to
her
mother
next
he
quoted
the
case
known
as
the
degree
of
dignity
when
it
was
ordered
that
all
those
apprehended
for
speaking
disrespectfully
of
the
grand
mufti
should
be
brought
into
his
presence
decapitated
again
what
interested
me
very
much
for
it
was
connected
with
money
the
terms
of
the
statute
now
over
one
hundred
years
old
by
which
the
councillors
of
the
king
receive
one
dinar
per
day
whatever
other
sum
they
see
fit
to
vote
themselves
out
of
the
taxes
it
was
the
word
said
he
that
made
the
difference
in
all
these
cases
he
might
call
witnesses
to
show
that
the
word
was
inserted
in
the
charter
to
render
the
phrase
abortive
absurd
nonsensical
and
altogether
of
no
effect
but
alternatively
supposing
that
the
word
but
confirmed
my
case
in
the
decision
of
his
holiness
then
he
pleaded
that
the
charter
having
been
obtained
by
a
stranger
not
a
subject
of
the
king
was
null
and
void
supposing
that
it
were
upheld
in
spite
of
this
then
alternatively
that
i
mahmoud
was
a
subject
of
the
king
a
native
born
and
therefore
subject
to
the
king
s
decisions
in
council
finally
he
concluded
that
in
any
case
i
must
not
win
because
if
i
did
it
would
make
his
majesty
s
council
and
members
thereof
look
like
a
fool
severally
and
collectively
than
which
no
more
deplorable
thing
could
happen
to
the
state
further
even
if
his
holiness
should
decide
that
it
mattered
not
a
rusty
nail
whether
the
council
were
made
to
look
fools
or
no
there
was
anyhow
no
money
to
pay
me
this
established
a
default
contumax
and
a
discharge
in
alias
of
the
second
degree
i
give
his
exact
words
for
i
noted
them
at
the
time
and
could
guess
vaguely
that
they
must
be
of
grave
import
when
he
got
so
far
i
noticed
a
great
commotion
among
his
colleagues
every
man
in
court
wore
an
expression
of
strained
attention
mixed
with
admiration
and
the
judge
himself
could
not
withhold
from
his
august
features
something
of
the
same
tribute
to
this
genius
of
debate
note
also
your
holiness
continued
the
pleader
wagging
his
arched
forefinger
which
was
long
and
pointed
very
significantly
in
the
air
the
contumax
in
advert
to
subvert
and
the
same
he
added
in
a
sort
of
sneering
tone
i
will
not
weary
the
court
with
that
i
could
see
that
the
judge
nodded
but
even
the
plaintiff
learned
as
he
is
in
the
law
will
admit
and
here
he
turned
and
addressed
me
with
a
very
contemptuous
expression
that
plevin
would
not
obtain
in
the
case
of
recognisance
or
at
any
rate
in
the
defection
thereof
would
be
docketed
as
an
endorsement
pursuant
an
endorsement
pursuant
would
stand
void
he
continued
with
a
renewed
interest
in
his
tone
he
now
excited
a
feverish
attention
in
his
audience
for
that
is
in
the
very
foundation
i
take
it
of
our
law
of
terce
and
perinomy
and
has
been
upheld
by
a
long
succession
of
your
holiness
s
predecessors
from
the
origins
of
our
sacred
lawyers
here
again
i
thought
i
noticed
the
trace
of
an
uncertain
nod
from
the
august
figure
upon
the
bench
it
comes
therefore
concluded
this
eloquent
man
in
plain
words
to
this
we
rely
on
the
terms
general
and
the
reference
particular
each
interconnected
and
certainly
maintain
that
guaranty
lies
here
he
stopped
dead
and
then
added
in
simple
and
lower
tones
that
is
my
then
he
sat
down
i
am
told
it
was
one
of
the
most
marvellous
efforts
in
all
the
history
of
the
lawyers
guild
applause
may
be
permitted
even
in
the
mosque
or
the
most
sacred
of
shrines
but
not
in
the
august
presence
of
the
law
yet
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
enraptured
pleaders
present
the
scriveners
and
their
attendants
could
forbear
from
open
praise
a
man
whom
i
did
not
know
and
who
sat
next
to
me
upon
his
mat
one
of
the
pleaders
i
think
for
he
also
wore
the
mule
skin
with
long
furry
ears
upon
his
head
muttered
to
me
that
it
was
the
finest
opening
he
had
heard
since
achmet
had
opened
for
the
in
the
oyster
case
and
that
was
saying
a
great
deal
when
this
great
pleader
had
sat
down
there
was
a
complete
silence
in
court
which
lasted
for
some
time
and
seemed
to
me
a
little
embarrassing
at
last
i
perceived
that
i
was
in
some
way
the
object
of
too
much
attention
and
my
friend
the
scrivener
leant
over
with
the
suggestion
that
i
should
call
my
witnesses
but
i
have
none
whispered
i
over
my
shoulder
in
great
trepidation
i
have
my
charter
that
is
enough
is
it
not
the
scrivener
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
in
despair
and
left
me
to
my
fate
then
was
it
that
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
great
judge
booming
into
my
ears
what
evidence
is
there
for
the
plaintiff
i
rose
trembling
i
have
given
you
all
i
have
your
you
have
given
me
none
thundered
that
tremendous
personage
all
you
have
done
is
to
make
an
opening
i
thought
stammered
i
that
i
had
stated
all
that
i
had
to
the
judge
glanced
round
at
his
fellow
lawyers
with
a
look
of
despair
then
leaning
forward
with
a
sort
of
tenderness
in
his
tone
he
said
be
good
enough
to
mount
the
sacred
stool
reserved
for
the
with
that
a
little
block
of
wood
was
brought
forward
and
upon
it
i
mounted
and
so
stood
conscious
and
foolish
before
the
court
his
holiness
the
judge
leaned
back
on
his
throne
and
surveyed
me
with
the
contempt
i
deserved
nor
did
he
repress
the
little
titter
that
ran
through
the
assembly
an
official
squatted
in
front
of
the
throne
put
a
scroll
into
my
hand
bade
me
put
it
to
my
forehead
and
repeat
after
him
certain
words
the
sense
of
which
i
lost
in
my
perturbation
but
i
did
as
i
was
bidden
after
that
i
remained
dumb
well
said
his
holiness
sharply
after
a
long
pause
how
much
longer
are
we
to
wait
pray
your
godship
what
would
you
have
said
i
i
would
have
your
evidence
said
the
judge
i
have
no
evidence
to
give
i
tremblingly
replied
save
what
you
have
already
i
have
heard
none
said
he
and
again
the
titter
went
round
the
court
moved
to
action
i
repeated
exactly
what
i
had
said
before
that
the
words
were
what
they
were
in
the
charter
the
clause
was
what
it
was
i
repeated
it
point
by
point
the
judge
turned
to
the
pleader
who
had
just
sat
down
and
said
now
brother
selim
whereupon
my
former
friend
and
guest
rose
looked
me
up
and
down
in
a
very
offensive
manner
from
head
to
foot
three
or
four
times
and
cried
you
drunken
scoundrel
do
you
still
maintain
the
abominable
falsehood
which
you
have
had
the
insolence
to
lay
before
the
court
i
said
there
was
no
falsehood
but
the
truth
the
truth
he
sneered
remember
pray
that
you
have
taken
an
oath
in
the
name
of
the
scroll
and
trivial
as
this
may
seem
to
a
man
of
your
depraved
character
others
take
the
matter
more
i
stood
silent
under
the
rebuke
and
waited
his
further
words
well
well
said
he
suddenly
where
were
you
half
an
hour
after
sunrise
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
fast
of
ramadan
in
the
three
hundred
and
seventh
year
from
the
flight
of
the
prophet
as
i
stood
aghast
at
the
question
he
touched
one
hand
significantly
with
the
finger
of
the
other
and
said
i
do
not
wish
to
press
i
have
not
the
least
idea
said
i
the
pleader
glanced
significantly
at
the
judge
and
then
continued
you
haven
t
the
least
idea
can
you
tell
me
approximately
where
you
were
no
i
can
not
said
i
it
is
very
long
ago
and
i
was
but
a
young
and
innocent
here
the
judge
interrupted
me
sharply
we
are
not
concerned
with
your
young
and
innocent
childhood
answer
the
question
if
you
please
and
make
no
the
pleader
consulted
his
notes
looked
up
to
me
again
and
said
you
have
told
us
the
charter
was
signed
in
your
presence
and
delivered
over
to
yes
said
i
don
t
answer
interrupted
his
holiness
sharply
until
you
are
asked
a
no
said
i
take
great
care
witness
said
his
holiness
in
a
menacing
voice
take
very
great
care
thank
you
your
holiness
said
the
pleader
and
now
sir
said
he
addressing
me
in
a
very
firm
tone
indeed
as
though
he
had
caught
some
thief
creeping
in
to
his
household
will
you
please
tell
us
where
is
that
charter
now
can
you
produce
it
his
holiness
is
sitting
on
it
said
i
simply
here
the
judge
almost
rose
from
his
throne
so
strongly
was
he
moved
were
you
not
a
layman
and
naturally
ignorant
of
the
forms
of
the
court
i
should
condemn
you
to
some
very
severe
penalty
said
he
i
make
allowance
for
your
lack
of
custom
but
i
warn
you
you
may
go
too
i
will
pass
over
the
last
remark
witness
continued
the
pleader
in
dignified
tones
i
think
you
were
not
quite
yourself
when
you
made
it
will
you
be
good
enough
to
answer
my
question
where
is
the
charter
now
well
said
i
all
bewildered
i
handed
it
up
for
his
holiness
to
see
what
my
case
was
and
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
silence
thundered
the
judge
brother
selim
i
am
afraid
we
shall
get
no
further
on
this
tack
the
witness
evidently
does
not
or
will
not
understand
your
drift
allow
me
to
ask
him
a
he
then
turned
with
a
sort
of
false
kindness
upon
his
face
and
said
to
me
in
measured
tones
what
we
want
to
know
is
where
is
the
charter
upon
which
you
claim
i
put
it
into
court
i
began
at
this
the
judge
gave
a
little
gesture
of
despair
and
sighed
then
he
spoke
it
is
a
principle
of
the
law
of
this
country
said
his
holiness
leaning
back
in
apparent
weariness
as
though
he
were
instructing
a
child
i
should
have
thought
a
principle
known
even
to
the
meanest
of
his
majesty
s
subjects
that
a
document
must
be
proved
have
you
proved
the
charter
of
which
you
speak
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
your
holiness
said
i
in
very
genuine
fear
the
judge
leaned
forward
towards
me
and
said
in
measured
tones
remember
that
i
am
treating
you
leniently
i
am
doing
what
i
can
for
you
i
understand
the
difficulty
of
your
position
take
care
take
very
great
care
brother
selim
have
you
any
other
questions
to
ask
i
have
one
or
two
of
some
consequence
if
i
may
be
allowed
your
holiness
certainly
brother
selim
pray
continue
we
are
all
the
pleader
cleared
his
throat
again
consulted
his
notes
looked
up
to
me
and
said
what
were
your
earnings
in
games
of
hazard
during
the
year
concluding
with
the
opening
of
the
last
feast
of
ramadan
i
answered
that
i
had
no
exact
calculation
but
that
i
had
small
stomach
for
such
pastimes
and
might
have
won
or
lost
anything
between
one
hundred
and
two
hundred
dinars
take
care
take
very
great
care
said
his
holiness
addressing
me
again
between
one
or
two
hundred
dinars
said
the
pleader
in
a
musing
sort
of
voice
and
i
noticed
that
the
judge
was
taking
a
note
of
my
reply
now
be
good
enough
you
base
fellow
to
answer
me
this
and
remember
you
are
upon
your
oath
have
you
been
in
the
habit
of
cheating
at
cards
loading
dice
stacking
packs
palming
coins
and
in
other
ways
overreaching
those
who
joined
you
in
what
they
thought
to
be
an
innocent
amusement
i
was
about
to
reply
when
he
again
thundered
at
me
remember
you
are
upon
your
oath
and
his
holiness
was
moved
to
add
take
care
witness
take
very
great
care
no
said
i
at
this
moment
i
was
astonished
to
see
everybody
including
the
pleader
sit
down
suddenly
upon
the
floor
while
i
stood
there
upon
my
little
block
of
wood
most
terribly
conspicuous
it
was
due
to
a
gesture
from
the
judge
so
far
said
he
in
a
solemn
and
majestic
manner
i
have
allowed
things
to
take
their
course
because
as
i
have
said
every
latitude
must
be
allowed
to
one
who
is
foolish
enough
to
plead
his
own
case
but
the
dignity
of
his
majesty
s
court
forbids
me
to
be
silent
upon
hearing
this
last
reply
to
a
question
of
the
most
profound
and
searching
kind
requiring
an
adequate
reply
the
witness
has
insolently
answered
no
he
then
turned
to
me
and
said
with
a
severity
that
thrilled
me
to
the
marrow
this
is
a
civil
court
but
remember
sir
and
here
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
very
terrible
manner
i
can
impound
documents
and
present
all
that
you
have
said
to
the
lord
yes
your
holiness
said
i
now
thoroughly
at
sea
proceed
said
the
judge
simply
to
the
pleader
i
have
only
one
more
question
to
ask
said
the
pleader
proceed
proceed
brother
selim
said
the
judge
with
geniality
do
you
or
do
you
not
suffer
from
the
itch
my
lord
said
i
am
i
really
to
reply
to
his
holiness
interrupted
me
with
a
violence
which
i
little
expected
from
one
in
so
exalted
a
position
answer
the
question
he
shouted
answer
the
question
at
once
well
said
i
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
some
little
affection
of
the
sole
of
my
left
foot
but
i
conceive
that
with
careful
attention
and
proper
medical
advice
that
will
do
said
the
pleader
putting
up
his
hand
we
have
heard
all
we
need
to
hear
and
he
sat
down
again
upon
his
mat
any
rebulgence
said
his
holiness
looking
round
with
a
pleasant
smile
upon
all
assembled
i
had
no
idea
what
was
meant
but
my
friend
the
scrivener
passed
me
up
a
little
note
saying
do
you
carefully
yourself
so
as
to
undo
the
effect
of
this
terrible
it
was
all
greek
to
me
but
grasping
at
a
straw
i
addressed
his
holiness
and
said
oh
voice
of
god
and
justice
upon
earth
i
would
like
to
ask
myself
certain
by
all
means
said
he
graciously
let
me
inform
you
what
is
the
custom
of
the
court
you
have
first
to
stand
and
ask
yourself
the
question
you
shall
then
stand
up
again
and
reply
to
kneeling
i
struck
the
pavement
of
the
court
three
times
with
my
forehead
as
is
the
custom
and
rising
again
turned
towards
the
empty
space
upon
the
little
block
of
wood
and
said
now
witness
remember
you
are
upon
your
oath
did
you
or
did
you
not
receive
the
charter
from
the
king
and
his
council
in
the
terms
you
have
mentioned
i
then
leapt
upon
the
little
block
of
wood
and
turning
to
the
place
i
had
just
occupied
i
said
i
i
then
jumped
down
again
luckily
i
was
still
a
young
man
and
the
exercise
did
not
affect
me
or
cause
me
loss
of
breath
and
i
asked
what
did
you
do
with
that
document
i
leapt
upon
the
little
block
of
wood
again
and
turned
to
the
place
i
had
just
occupied
and
answered
i
brought
it
into
once
more
did
i
take
up
my
place
on
the
floor
standing
beneath
the
little
block
of
wood
having
brought
it
into
court
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
returned
to
my
little
block
of
wood
faced
the
place
i
had
just
occupied
and
said
i
handed
it
up
to
his
the
judge
then
spoke
i
have
had
enough
of
this
and
i
refuse
to
waste
the
time
of
the
court
longer
it
is
in
my
power
to
condemn
you
to
the
king
s
dungeons
for
ever
and
i
may
say
that
never
in
my
long
experience
of
our
august
courts
have
i
come
across
anything
to
parallel
your
repeated
insolence
i
have
already
told
you
that
you
have
not
proved
your
document
and
therefore
for
the
purposes
of
this
court
it
does
not
exist
stand
the
words
stand
down
signify
in
the
technical
language
of
this
great
people
sit
down
and
can
only
be
disobeyed
under
the
most
fearful
penalties
i
at
once
obeyed
and
resumed
my
place
upon
the
mat
the
judge
was
now
free
to
give
his
decision
but
first
he
turned
to
the
pleader
who
had
opposed
me
and
said
in
the
most
genial
tones
brother
selim
you
have
i
take
it
proved
your
document
especially
the
word
and
oh
yes
my
lord
answered
he
in
a
satisfied
manner
i
have
further
interpleaded
for
secondary
and
excised
the
four
principal
terminants
all
of
which
are
duly
stamped
passed
filed
recorded
exuded
denoted
permuted
polluted
and
to
each
of
these
words
the
judge
nodded
with
greater
and
greater
content
and
then
asked
do
you
call
any
further
witnesses
brother
selim
i
call
none
replied
the
eminent
man
for
if
i
do
the
vile
plaintiff
would
have
an
opportunity
of
them
and
that
would
give
away
my
whole
i
think
you
have
done
wisely
said
his
holiness
by
way
of
an
obiter
dictum
things
shall
therefore
turn
upon
the
charter
with
these
words
i
perceived
by
the
rustle
all
about
me
that
the
last
phase
of
the
trial
had
come
and
that
my
fate
was
sealed
i
thought
i
had
observed
in
the
manner
of
its
conduct
i
will
not
say
a
bias
but
a
sort
of
atmosphere
unfavourable
to
my
claims
for
though
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
that
any
personal
or
other
feeling
could
affect
his
holiness
s
mind
yet
i
dreaded
his
decision
none
the
less
i
awaited
that
decision
with
some
interest
for
after
all
nothing
is
certain
until
it
is
concluded
the
judge
put
down
his
crown
assumed
a
headgear
which
resembled
that
of
the
special
pleaders
but
gilded
and
with
the
interior
of
the
long
furry
ears
carefully
painted
in
silver
by
way
of
contrast
for
such
the
custom
of
the
law
demands
when
a
decision
is
about
to
be
delivered
he
spoke
from
the
evidence
that
has
been
laid
before
me
it
is
clear
that
there
exists
or
has
existed
will
exist
or
may
exist
or
can
exist
or
at
some
other
time
existed
demurrer
notwithstanding
some
charter
wherein
the
word
and
is
the
point
at
issue
that
form
was
admitted
by
the
defence
i
think
all
the
pleaders
rose
and
bowed
and
then
again
were
seated
upon
their
carpets
but
i
gather
and
here
he
looked
sternly
at
me
that
there
was
no
acceptance
by
the
plaintiff
we
have
i
take
it
an
operative
clause
wherein
the
operative
word
is
and
and
so
long
as
the
salt
tax
many
points
brought
forward
in
defence
of
the
crown
i
am
compelled
to
overlook
it
is
the
glory
of
our
courts
of
justice
that
they
exercise
an
absolutely
dealing
between
man
and
man
and
that
his
majesty
himself
is
bound
by
their
here
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
which
was
instantly
suppressed
i
make
therefore
so
bold
as
to
say
that
the
counsel
engaged
by
his
majesty
on
this
occasion
have
said
many
things
with
which
i
do
not
agree
and
others
which
i
shall
not
take
into
account
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
case
presented
by
the
plaintiff
is
as
he
put
it
no
case
at
all
and
that
were
i
to
rely
as
i
shall
not
upon
the
strict
forms
of
law
he
is
already
out
of
at
this
all
looked
severely
on
me
and
i
felt
my
stature
singularly
diminished
and
crouched
lower
upon
my
mat
his
holiness
continued
i
shall
treat
this
matter
as
though
i
had
heard
no
pleadings
upon
either
side
for
this
i
take
to
be
the
true
attitude
of
a
judge
concerned
with
justice
alone
we
have
then
this
operative
and
this
decisive
word
here
his
holiness
leaned
back
on
his
throne
cast
his
eyes
upwards
towards
the
rich
arabesques
of
the
ceiling
sighed
and
continued
the
word
and
is
among
the
most
significant
of
our
ancient
glorious
language
it
has
been
used
upon
innumerable
occasions
our
industrial
classes
our
nobility
and
even
our
middle
classes
as
well
as
the
poor
in
their
humble
station
are
compelled
to
its
continual
expression
it
is
if
i
may
so
express
myself
part
of
the
heritage
of
our
race
he
would
indeed
be
poor
in
spirit
and
weak
in
his
allegiance
to
the
imperial
traditions
of
this
island
continued
his
holiness
warming
to
his
subject
did
he
not
appreciate
the
majesty
the
significance
the
grandeur
upon
occasions
the
full
effect
and
indeed
the
awful
weight
of
this
little
word
and
here
he
dropped
his
voice
and
and
so
long
as
the
salt
tax
etc
that
is
the
point
and
i
trust
i
have
made
myself
all
heads
nodded
in
unison
while
a
song
in
adoration
of
his
holiness
was
sung
by
an
acolyte
who
entered
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
as
is
customary
in
courts
of
law
and
a
hidden
chorus
distant
but
just
heard
added
a
short
canticle
of
praise
his
holiness
waited
for
the
conclusion
of
these
ceremonies
which
are
invariably
interpolated
during
any
important
judgment
and
then
continued
and
so
long
what
is
the
significance
of
that
word
and
i
take
it
that
it
is
affirmative
negative
copulative
and
restrictive
but
that
is
not
all
i
think
it
is
also
constructive
instructive
and
destructive
it
is
only
by
using
it
in
all
these
ways
that
we
can
fully
appreciate
its
preponderant
significance
in
the
issue
before
once
more
all
heads
nodded
and
even
i
was
constrained
to
follow
the
custom
although
in
my
ignorance
i
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
learned
argument
the
lawyers
present
bore
a
look
of
such
intense
absorption
that
one
would
have
thought
their
lives
depended
on
what
was
to
come
the
plaintiff
in
reciting
the
clause
said
his
holiness
quite
suddenly
emphasized
a
very
singular
phrase
for
ever
and
for
ever
and
also
those
other
words
so
long
as
the
state
endures
but
i
noticed
a
curious
hesitation
upon
his
part
when
he
came
to
this
word
here
some
one
in
the
back
of
the
court
yawned
in
so
audible
a
manner
that
there
was
a
sudden
interruption
signalling
an
ejection
and
i
learned
later
that
the
unfortunate
man
had
perished
as
he
deserved
i
appreciate
fully
continued
the
judge
that
my
decision
will
subject
to
appeal
determine
in
great
part
the
future
of
this
ancient
state
since
we
are
destined
soon
to
acquire
and
administer
the
whole
world
it
may
be
said
that
my
humble
remarks
upon
this
occasion
will
deflect
the
history
of
the
human
race
itself
no
one
can
be
insensitive
to
such
a
responsibility
my
duty
is
clear
the
word
and
standing
as
it
does
between
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
phrase
on
which
is
based
plaintiff
s
claim
under
the
charter
clearly
determines
that
claim
but
to
determine
is
to
terminate
the
plaintiff
has
therefore
no
rights
here
in
the
sense
of
the
word
rights
as
used
by
the
august
body
of
our
statute
and
common
law
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
crown
and
his
claim
is
disallowed
he
may
think
himself
lucky
that
i
have
not
taken
advantage
of
my
full
powers
and
had
him
whipped
at
the
cart
s
tail
or
thrown
down
a
well
let
record
be
made
and
all
adjudged
as
with
this
his
holiness
majestically
rose
granted
a
benediction
to
the
kneeling
multitude
and
was
about
to
leave
the
court
when
the
pleader
selim
interrupted
with
the
words
what
about
costs
your
godship
with
the
judgment
said
the
judge
wearily
over
his
shoulder
and
i
noticed
to
my
dismay
ten
pens
busily
scribbling
and
wondered
what
was
coming
next
indeed
i
was
weary
of
the
whole
affair
and
desired
nothing
better
than
to
hide
my
humble
head
in
my
poor
lodging
and
on
the
morrow
with
what
was
left
of
my
poor
little
hoard
at
the
most
dinars
to
leave
for
the
mainland
and
there
with
this
tiny
capital
attempt
to
reconstruct
my
fortunes
it
was
not
to
be
as
i
imagined
even
as
i
approached
the
door
of
the
court
i
was
approached
by
the
pleader
selim
who
repeated
that
phrase
hitherto
meaningless
what
about
costs
and
found
i
might
not
depart
from
the
building
till
i
had
provided
dinars
leaving
me
with
exactly
fifty
to
face
the
world
luckily
i
had
my
pouch
upon
me
i
hurriedly
counted
out
this
last
poor
remainder
of
my
wealth
then
fearing
to
return
to
my
lodging
the
rent
of
which
i
could
no
longer
discharge
i
paced
hopelessly
along
the
quays
through
the
evening
and
on
through
the
darkness
until
about
midnight
i
espied
a
master
mariner
about
to
board
his
vessel
for
what
sum
i
asked
him
will
you
take
me
on
deck
to
the
mainland
it
is
a
hundred
dinars
he
said
roughly
i
have
it
not
i
answered
my
stomach
was
already
clamouring
for
food
i
have
but
fifty
dinars
and
some
part
of
that
i
must
reserve
for
my
nourishment
lest
i
perish
before
reaching
well
said
he
a
little
less
roughly
but
with
no
humanity
in
his
tone
you
may
crawl
up
forward
among
the
cordage
if
you
like
and
give
me
of
your
coins
the
five
you
shall
keep
to
feed
yourself
with
when
you
i
thanked
him
humbly
for
his
unexpected
kindness
i
tried
to
find
some
warmth
in
the
chilly
night
huddled
amid
coils
of
rope
on
the
little
deck
forward
at
dawn
the
last
of
the
crew
came
aboard
two
great
sails
were
hoisted
and
we
passed
out
upon
the
sea
before
the
sun
was
high
we
had
dropped
over
the
horizon
and
left
behind
us
the
palaces
of
the
land
where
i
had
thought
to
find
security
and
repose
there
i
was
i
who
had
so
lately
had
the
world
at
my
disposal
a
beggar
hopeless
for
the
coming
days
and
wondering
where
on
my
landing
i
should
find
food
to
keep
me
living
for
a
week
as
mahmoud
was
concluding
there
rose
a
loud
wail
piercing
and
prolonged
which
startled
him
and
all
the
file
of
boys
aligned
before
him
upon
the
floor
it
proceeded
from
the
youngest
of
the
nephews
what
is
it
my
little
fellow
said
his
uncle
in
real
alarm
ah
ah
sobbed
out
the
poor
infant
lost
lost
all
lost
all
that
lovely
money
lost
i
can
not
bear
it
uncle
i
can
not
bear
it
and
he
burst
into
floods
of
tears
for
heaven
s
sake
said
the
old
man
rolling
upon
his
seat
in
his
concern
for
the
child
do
not
take
on
so
there
is
no
cause
for
such
a
bother
you
make
too
much
of
it
it
is
but
part
of
a
tale
do
you
not
see
how
i
have
been
restored
to
great
fortune
are
you
not
in
this
palace
of
mine
with
all
my
slaves
around
you
and
splendid
hangings
upon
the
wall
come
look
about
you
and
do
not
mix
up
these
words
of
the
past
with
real
things
that
you
can
touch
and
see
the
little
boy
tried
to
stifle
his
sobs
but
they
returned
with
increased
violence
oh
uncle
to
think
that
you
who
had
been
so
rich
should
become
so
poor
to
think
that
those
who
gain
great
wealth
can
not
keep
it
for
ever
consider
all
your
wealth
oh
it
is
terrible
the
death
and
destruction
of
it
throwing
himself
down
upon
the
marble
floor
he
buried
his
face
in
his
crossed
arms
and
kicked
either
foot
alternately
in
the
air
in
the
violent
paroxysm
of
his
grief
his
uncle
was
so
moved
that
he
knelt
beside
the
child
to
soothe
him
pray
pray
restrain
yourself
he
said
you
will
do
yourself
some
hurt
i
admire
you
my
dear
boy
i
perceive
your
singular
gifts
more
than
all
your
elder
brothers
do
you
seem
to
know
that
which
the
young
should
seek
in
life
you
understand
indeed
what
others
do
not
always
all
that
money
means
but
it
is
terrible
to
see
one
of
your
age
suffering
such
agonies
from
a
mere
recital
of
its
loss
indeed
i
am
moved
to
console
you
here
the
old
man
was
tempted
to
put
his
hand
into
his
pouch
and
offer
some
small
coin
in
consolation
to
the
child
but
he
recollected
himself
and
continued
to
console
you
with
a
pleasant
draft
of
cold
water
which
i
am
afraid
i
forgot
to
tender
to
you
and
your
brothers
when
i
last
had
the
pleasure
of
your
the
little
fellow
sat
up
still
sobbing
but
attempting
to
dry
his
eyes
and
moaning
from
time
to
time
all
that
money
all
that
lovely
money
pure
cold
crystal
water
was
brought
round
and
gratefully
sipped
by
the
boys
who
when
they
had
thus
refreshed
themselves
at
their
uncle
s
expense
thanked
him
warmly
and
disappeared
with
reverence
from
his
presence
just
at
the
moment
when
the
voice
of
the
muezzin
was
heard
from
a
neighbouring
minaret
boring
the
faithful
to
tears
with
its
repeated
call
to
prayer
الغنم
that
is
the
sheep
chapter
vii
entitled
or
the
sheep
as
mahmoud
s
nephews
filed
in
just
after
the
hour
of
public
executions
to
hear
the
continuation
of
their
uncle
s
absorbing
tale
they
wore
an
expression
different
from
that
which
he
had
observed
on
their
faces
during
so
many
days
the
thought
of
this
great
man
subjected
to
misfortune
like
any
other
and
passing
through
the
trials
of
actual
poverty
had
shocked
their
young
and
sensitive
souls
they
had
been
trained
indeed
even
in
their
short
experience
to
the
idea
that
they
and
their
poor
father
must
suffer
contempt
but
that
the
head
of
the
family
should
ever
have
passed
through
such
things
shook
their
faith
in
the
world
the
aged
merchant
a
little
concerned
with
their
appearance
warned
them
that
what
he
had
to
tell
them
not
only
upon
that
day
but
later
too
would
be
concerned
with
no
happy
relation
these
were
my
children
said
he
the
days
of
my
dereliction
they
served
to
humble
me
and
often
when
i
have
occasion
to
turn
a
poor
man
out
of
his
house
or
to
prosecute
some
starving
widow
for
debt
or
to
see
to
the
imprisonment
of
one
who
has
failed
to
keep
some
contract
i
may
have
imposed
upon
him
i
sigh
and
chasten
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
myself
might
but
for
the
infinite
goodness
of
my
god
have
been
in
his
or
her
position
though
frankly
i
can
not
say
considering
the
ineptitude
of
such
people
that
i
can
ever
imagine
them
in
having
so
prefaced
what
he
had
to
tell
the
merchant
proceeded
i
sat
down
then
in
the
bows
of
the
boat
on
that
miserable
night
watching
for
land
i
tried
to
make
some
plan
as
is
the
habit
of
men
of
my
temper
but
none
would
form
itself
in
my
fatigued
and
unhappy
brain
one
asset
i
had
and
one
only
over
and
above
the
few
coins
which
could
hardly
last
me
for
more
than
a
day
and
that
was
the
dress
i
wore
for
i
still
carried
the
fine
clothes
of
my
former
rank
i
had
worn
them
on
the
occasion
of
the
trial
indeed
i
now
had
no
others
this
accoutrement
and
a
certain
proud
manner
of
bearing
which
i
had
acquired
during
the
past
years
of
my
affluence
saved
me
from
insult
though
i
am
not
sure
that
if
i
had
been
asked
to
carry
some
package
for
the
wealthier
of
the
passengers
i
should
not
have
accepted
the
opportunity
of
reward
i
spent
about
half
my
poor
handful
of
cash
on
a
meal
with
the
remainder
i
purchased
provision
for
the
evening
the
town
in
which
i
found
myself
was
happily
too
busy
and
populous
a
mart
to
pay
attention
to
a
chance
wanderer
lacking
all
direction
trusting
as
i
had
trusted
long
ago
to
fortune
or
rather
to
providence
i
betook
myself
after
the
worst
heat
of
the
day
had
passed
to
a
chance
track
which
led
first
along
the
river
side
above
the
harbour
and
afterwards
climbed
through
the
gardens
of
the
city
to
the
hills
beyond
the
countryside
was
here
of
a
nature
more
fertile
than
the
countries
through
which
i
had
hitherto
passed
the
dense
trees
of
the
woods
made
a
grateful
shade
for
me
in
that
silent
afternoon
and
when
i
had
passed
beyond
these
on
my
upward
journey
i
came
to
a
great
rolling
land
of
sparse
grass
feed
for
cattle
it
was
hired
out
it
would
seem
to
graziers
for
i
saw
some
little
way
off
standing
in
the
attitude
of
a
shepherd
and
holding
his
bent
staff
beside
his
vigorous
old
frame
a
very
remarkable
figure
i
approached
him
without
any
set
idea
of
what
my
adventure
might
lead
to
i
only
knew
that
things
could
not
be
worse
perhaps
i
had
somewhere
in
my
mind
a
guess
that
i
could
be
of
some
service
at
some
small
wage
at
any
rate
i
accosted
him
i
have
seldom
seen
an
expression
more
haughty
and
vigorous
and
marvelled
that
it
should
be
that
of
a
hired
man
he
was
perhaps
sixty
years
of
age
with
a
strong
bearing
eyes
luminous
and
almost
fierce
and
a
face
in
outline
that
of
a
hawk
or
better
that
of
an
eagle
and
as
he
stood
there
he
watched
grazing
before
him
a
great
flock
of
sheep
well
fed
and
fat
of
a
high
breed
excellent
to
behold
there
were
at
least
a
thousand
of
these
and
it
would
seem
that
the
religion
of
this
part
for
they
also
were
true
believers
did
not
forbid
the
use
of
bells
for
i
heard
a
multitudinous
tinkling
come
up
from
the
flock
as
it
moved
very
far
away
the
plateau
made
an
edge
against
the
sky
and
between
that
horizon
and
the
summit
to
which
i
had
reached
folds
with
water
pools
concealed
in
them
diversified
the
great
sweep
but
there
were
no
trees
all
was
bare
and
majestic
under
the
sky
as
the
light
melted
towards
evening
the
shepherd
returned
my
salutation
accepted
my
offer
to
share
the
very
scanty
food
which
i
had
purchased
and
so
sat
down
before
me
on
the
ground
to
eat
as
we
ate
we
grew
acquainted
i
told
him
frankly
enough
of
my
misfortune
though
not
in
detail
i
was
said
i
only
the
day
before
yesterday
a
rich
man
i
am
what
you
see
and
my
last
piece
of
silver
is
he
looked
at
me
gravely
and
said
that
there
was
one
who
gave
and
who
took
away
his
name
be
exalted
these
sheep
for
instance
said
he
are
the
property
of
a
man
contemptible
in
every
way
foolish
irascible
a
bad
master
and
one
would
have
thought
an
unwise
merchant
yet
he
prospers
while
i
the
shepherd
remain
upon
a
hire
too
small
to
permit
me
to
save
and
so
it
has
been
for
years
i
have
not
added
he
a
little
bitterly
the
faculties
for
that
sort
of
life
which
my
master
pursues
at
any
rate
i
am
quite
certain
of
this
that
by
any
common
judgment
of
men
he
is
the
inferior
and
i
the
lord
yet
here
i
am
the
world
deals
harshly
by
poor
he
looked
at
me
to
see
if
the
words
sank
in
as
he
thus
spoke
his
sadness
seemed
to
relieve
my
own
with
a
sense
of
our
common
dependence
the
sun
now
near
the
horizon
warned
us
of
prayer
and
i
was
glad
indeed
to
see
that
this
new
chance
companion
was
as
much
alive
as
i
to
the
duties
we
owe
our
maker
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
bowed
to
the
evening
prayer
as
i
did
beside
him
and
for
some
moments
as
we
recited
the
sacred
formula
all
worldly
thoughts
passed
from
my
mind
and
i
think
from
his
also
we
rose
at
the
same
moment
from
this
exercise
each
filled
i
felt
with
brotherhood
i
was
the
first
to
break
the
consecrated
silence
i
did
so
by
asking
him
whether
he
had
never
thought
in
the
course
of
his
long
years
as
a
shepherd
how
money
might
be
made
by
the
stealing
of
his
master
s
sheep
or
by
some
trick
with
them
whether
he
had
never
had
the
opportunity
to
blackmail
his
master
or
in
some
other
way
to
increase
his
fortune
for
it
seemed
intolerable
to
me
that
a
man
such
as
he
described
his
employer
to
be
should
be
wealthy
while
he
were
poor
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
in
despair
and
answered
simply
in
the
distant
past
i
often
attempted
such
things
but
invariably
have
i
failed
indeed
the
master
graziers
of
this
part
know
me
well
for
one
who
has
attempted
at
their
expense
every
kind
of
bold
chance
and
i
would
never
have
employment
from
them
were
it
not
for
my
skill
in
lambing
and
in
every
other
part
of
the
trade
as
it
is
they
watch
me
rigorously
their
spies
are
everywhere
i
could
not
i
fear
make
one
dinar
by
any
one
of
the
methods
you
suggest
i
have
in
my
time
tried
them
all
i
have
forged
receipts
i
have
sold
sheep
which
afterwards
i
entered
as
dead
from
accident
i
have
falsified
the
returns
of
the
lambing
i
have
sometimes
raised
a
sum
of
money
upon
the
flock
under
pretence
that
it
was
my
own
my
only
reward
has
been
fine
and
imprisonment
and
cruel
torture
but
the
truth
is
that
i
have
not
the
faculties
of
the
merchant
they
are
i
take
it
granted
to
some
and
withheld
from
others
for
my
part
i
have
despaired
of
their
exercise
and
shall
never
turn
to
them
his
words
filled
me
at
once
with
pity
and
with
hope
and
since
ingenuity
is
never
long
absent
from
men
of
my
temper
a
scheme
suddenly
appeared
why
should
not
we
i
said
after
i
had
gathered
wood
and
lit
a
fire
to
meet
the
approaching
darkness
enter
into
partnership
i
think
i
may
say
without
boasting
that
i
possess
in
a
singular
degree
those
faculties
which
you
say
you
lack
god
made
me
in
every
part
for
a
merchant
i
can
conceal
distort
forestall
outdo
bully
terrify
and
even
boldly
snatch
far
better
than
any
other
man
i
have
come
across
only
once
in
my
life
have
i
fallen
into
the
weakness
of
trusting
others
and
as
you
see
i
have
paid
bitterly
for
that
so
i
spoke
not
noticing
that
i
was
yet
again
committing
the
same
error
in
suggesting
partnership
to
a
mere
stranger
but
in
truth
allah
had
blinded
me
purposing
to
make
me
taste
misfortune
to
the
full
that
i
might
the
better
adore
his
later
beneficence
all
these
talents
i
have
in
abundance
and
more
also
i
continued
for
god
has
been
very
good
to
me
you
on
the
other
hand
have
what
i
lack
that
is
a
knowledge
of
the
towns
round
about
and
of
their
markets
of
the
value
of
sheep
of
the
system
which
has
been
organized
for
the
catching
of
ingenious
men
and
of
how
that
system
may
be
avoided
between
us
then
we
have
all
the
things
needed
for
our
success
come
let
us
determine
with
the
very
next
breaking
of
the
light
to
try
our
fortunes
after
i
had
thus
spoken
the
shepherd
looked
at
me
long
and
anxiously
over
the
fire
the
reflection
of
which
shone
in
his
piercing
eyes
i
wondered
whether
he
were
wavering
and
to
what
conclusion
he
would
come
at
last
he
spoke
slowly
enough
i
am
not
willing
said
he
i
am
not
willing
but
i
will
take
the
risk
the
worst
that
can
come
to
me
i
have
already
suffered
at
the
best
and
he
pointed
towards
the
vast
flock
of
sheep
now
a
mass
of
glimmering
white
as
they
lay
in
the
darkness
at
the
best
we
should
each
acquire
provision
for
many
oh
fool
thought
i
provision
for
many
years
does
he
not
know
how
money
breeds
but
in
open
speech
i
said
yes
we
will
divide
the
spoil
and
go
our
ways
i
with
my
share
and
you
with
precisely
he
answered
with
a
curious
smile
which
for
the
moment
intrigued
me
you
with
your
share
and
i
with
as
the
night
passed
i
entertained
him
with
the
details
of
my
plan
since
it
was
i
who
had
to
do
the
work
while
he
would
have
to
command
from
his
knowledge
of
the
trade
i
proposed
that
he
should
be
the
master
and
i
the
man
to
all
this
he
nodded
assent
he
was
also
prepared
to
meet
me
in
my
suggestion
that
he
should
put
on
my
fine
clothes
and
i
his
rags
the
better
to
carry
out
our
parts
this
will
said
i
seem
strange
while
you
are
driving
the
sheep
but
as
we
approach
the
town
and
market
to
which
you
shall
direct
me
if
there
be
one
nearby
i
will
attempt
to
take
over
your
task
and
under
your
direction
i
may
at
least
complete
it
by
bringing
the
flock
to
the
place
of
sale
i
will
speak
of
you
as
the
owner
my
fine
dress
which
you
wear
will
carry
out
that
deception
and
deceive
all
into
thinking
that
it
is
an
honest
transaction
the
sum
upon
which
we
shall
agree
with
the
purchaser
shall
be
paid
to
and
not
until
the
whole
transaction
is
over
and
we
well
out
of
the
gate
shall
i
ask
for
the
division
which
i
take
it
should
be
in
equal
to
all
this
also
he
agreed
only
asking
whether
i
would
not
like
as
after
all
i
had
only
just
met
him
to
have
the
money
paid
to
both
i
urged
him
to
keep
to
my
plan
his
receiving
the
money
as
master
would
seem
natural
and
excite
no
surprise
we
could
divide
in
private
at
our
leisure
to
my
surprise
he
made
me
a
low
bow
at
this
but
i
put
it
down
to
custom
and
went
on
with
my
plan
for
the
sake
of
a
rough
calculation
i
asked
him
what
sheep
were
fetching
and
he
said
that
in
the
neighbouring
ksar
which
might
be
called
a
straggling
market
town
or
a
large
village
there
was
to
be
held
it
so
happened
the
very
next
day
a
sheep
market
where
we
must
find
ourselves
shortly
after
sunrise
it
was
distant
less
than
an
hour
across
the
uplands
the
purchasers
came
from
all
parts
and
as
the
bidding
was
likely
to
be
brisk
we
might
expect
for
the
flock
as
a
whole
not
less
than
or
even
pieces
of
gold
as
he
spoke
i
already
felt
that
capital
in
my
possession
or
at
least
half
of
it
and
i
thought
things
would
go
hard
with
me
if
after
our
first
successful
transaction
i
could
not
carry
on
my
partner
to
another
and
another
until
at
last
i
had
manipulated
him
out
of
his
share
also
we
discussed
all
further
details
through
the
night
rehearsed
our
parts
and
had
the
whole
perfect
when
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
showed
in
the
east
beyond
the
edges
of
the
hills
beneath
a
waning
moon
we
rose
the
flock
was
gathered
our
garments
exchanged
and
i
could
not
but
admire
my
companion
now
that
he
was
dressed
in
what
seemed
a
manner
so
much
more
suitable
to
his
carriage
and
features
he
looked
a
very
master
a
prosperous
lord
of
men
and
i
congratulated
him
upon
the
effect
which
i
assured
him
would
allay
all
suspicion
since
all
would
take
him
for
a
very
great
lord
indeed
again
he
smiled
that
intriguing
smile
and
bowed
too
low
but
i
was
a
little
nettled
at
his
affecting
to
play
the
part
thoroughly
by
addressing
me
in
sharp
tones
and
with
the
air
of
a
superior
i
for
my
part
shivered
in
the
dawn
in
the
miserable
rags
which
i
had
taken
from
him
and
holding
his
staff
awkwardly
enough
tramped
on
in
my
character
of
the
servant
soon
just
as
the
sun
rose
the
dusty
hedges
and
the
cracked
yellowish
walls
of
the
ksar
appeared
in
a
hollow
through
which
ran
a
muddy
stream
from
the
enclosures
within
rose
the
bleating
of
many
sheep
which
had
been
driven
to
the
same
market
and
we
observed
upon
the
folds
of
land
beyond
several
flocks
arriving
in
convergence
upon
the
same
place
my
companion
told
me
while
we
were
still
out
of
earshot
that
an
early
arrival
would
allow
us
to
watch
the
movement
of
prices
and
what
was
of
more
value
to
us
might
enable
us
to
get
away
before
opportunity
for
pursuit
should
arise
he
gave
me
my
last
instructions
recalling
all
that
we
had
arranged
in
the
night
i
for
my
part
said
he
as
the
first
sheep
of
our
great
flock
entered
the
narrow
streets
shall
fall
behind
you
and
take
my
way
to
the
pavement
outside
the
mosque
reserved
for
the
principal
merchants
and
there
with
all
due
dignity
and
honour
await
your
report
while
you
go
forward
to
the
market
place
beyond
the
mosque
when
you
have
got
a
purchaser
come
back
and
find
me
for
such
is
here
the
custom
it
is
the
servant
who
negotiates
the
master
who
confirms
the
servant
leads
the
purchaser
to
his
superior
and
that
superior
takes
the
purchase
money
do
you
for
your
part
cast
around
until
you
hear
the
conversation
of
the
bidders
and
see
that
you
sell
at
a
price
not
less
than
pieces
of
he
then
gave
the
number
of
our
flock
all
told
which
he
made
me
repeat
to
a
single
point
in
ewes
and
in
lambs
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
behind
me
and
went
up
a
street
which
led
to
the
mosque
while
i
in
some
doubt
of
my
capacity
but
putting
what
bold
face
i
could
upon
the
matter
went
straight
before
me
along
the
broad
way
toward
the
market
beyond
there
i
drove
all
the
flock
into
a
great
pen
of
which
certain
were
reserved
for
the
vendors
in
that
mart
the
market
soon
filled
with
buyers
they
came
in
little
groups
prodding
the
sheep
feeling
the
wool
and
sometimes
looking
into
their
mouths
and
the
flock
which
i
had
the
honour
of
commanding
was
the
most
admired
of
all
i
was
asked
by
several
if
i
would
not
sell
singly
but
estimating
the
eagerness
of
the
buyers
i
shook
my
head
and
said
i
could
not
sell
for
less
than
a
reserve
sum
of
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
nor
could
i
break
the
flock
i
added
that
it
was
a
pity
to
do
so
as
it
was
a
pedigree
flock
every
single
animal
being
descended
from
the
famous
ram
which
had
spoken
in
a
human
voice
to
the
holy
hassan
three
hundred
years
ago
by
order
of
the
most
high
i
admitted
that
this
origin
made
little
difference
to
the
mutton
but
i
pointed
out
its
extraordinary
effect
upon
the
wool
with
that
the
bidding
began
and
i
noticed
with
great
pleasure
one
tall
dark
very
thin
man
among
the
rest
slow
of
gesture
fixed
of
eye
who
never
took
his
looks
from
my
face
and
who
just
after
each
last
bid
would
raise
it
by
fifty
pieces
of
gold
he
was
not
to
be
beaten
one
competitor
after
another
dropped
out
at
last
when
the
magnificent
sum
of
pieces
of
gold
had
been
bid
by
the
mysterious
stranger
i
clapped
my
hands
together
as
the
signal
and
used
the
formula
heaven
has
the
stranger
approached
me
drawing
from
his
girdle
a
reed
and
a
small
horn
of
ink
i
thought
we
were
about
to
sign
the
transfer
it
seemed
to
me
an
odd
formality
seeing
that
he
had
but
to
drive
the
beasts
away
and
leave
me
the
bag
of
gold
i
was
undeceived
he
presented
me
no
charter
of
transfer
no
deed
but
a
strange
piece
of
writing
such
as
i
had
not
seen
before
and
asked
me
for
its
counterpart
i
was
startled
and
a
little
confused
what
counterpart
said
i
do
you
mean
said
he
in
clear
tones
so
that
the
curious
bystanders
should
overhear
that
you
have
no
permit
at
this
the
audience
tittered
and
others
scenting
amusement
crowded
round
to
gaze
and
follow
have
you
no
permit
he
repeated
severely
i
felt
myself
growing
hot
and
confused
under
the
laughter
which
followed
and
even
alarmed
when
i
heard
one
buyer
say
contemptuously
to
his
neighbour
they
ve
caught
another
of
em
i
confessed
that
i
had
never
even
heard
of
such
an
instrument
follow
me
said
the
stranger
grimly
and
whether
from
curiosity
or
from
a
conviction
growing
in
me
that
he
had
authority
i
followed
humbly
enough
leaving
my
large
flock
bleating
in
its
pen
the
stranger
for
he
now
showed
that
he
had
upon
him
the
keys
of
the
market
locked
the
gate
of
the
pen
appointed
another
proof
of
his
authority
a
slave
to
stand
by
and
see
that
no
one
interfered
with
the
property
i
had
transferred
to
him
and
motioned
to
others
to
fall
in
behind
us
he
then
led
me
away
and
i
was
more
concerned
than
ever
to
notice
the
strange
smiles
of
those
who
saw
the
little
procession
which
we
made
he
going
first
with
his
great
staff
i
treading
behind
he
led
me
to
where
the
sheiks
of
the
neighbourhood
the
principal
sheep
owners
and
magistrates
sat
in
solemnity
before
the
mosque
an
company
grand
and
splendid
among
them
in
their
very
centre
and
clearly
the
most
revered
of
them
all
i
perceived
my
late
companion
the
shepherd
all
dressed
up
in
my
own
fine
clothes
but
having
now
added
ornaments
reserved
for
him
and
looking
for
all
the
world
like
the
king
of
the
place
at
our
approach
he
turned
an
indignant
glance
upon
me
rose
to
his
feet
and
addressing
the
stranger
who
had
captured
me
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
officer
do
you
bring
me
yet
another
of
these
evildoers
whose
sheep
had
he
driven
off
and
is
it
a
case
of
a
forged
permit
or
what
i
already
saw
how
the
land
lay
and
i
quailed
to
think
what
was
before
me
the
owners
i
rightly
guessed
had
suffered
from
sheep
stealing
had
established
permits
signed
by
them
in
order
to
check
fraudulent
sales
had
plotted
to
catch
the
thief
culprits
and
this
perfidious
man
had
disguised
himself
as
a
servant
in
order
to
catch
such
and
had
caught
the
officer
who
had
arrested
me
spoke
my
lord
he
said
we
have
caught
this
ruffian
pointing
to
me
selling
sheep
without
any
permit
at
all
he
must
have
driven
them
through
the
night
by
the
law
which
your
council
proclaimed
last
year
just
after
the
fast
his
punishment
lies
in
your
hands
the
owner
has
the
determination
of
to
my
astonishment
and
horror
my
former
companion
looked
on
me
with
a
dreadful
face
of
scorn
and
said
tell
me
all
that
i
may
apportion
the
punishment
due
to
him
i
had
had
him
in
my
employ
for
but
a
short
time
i
mistrusted
him
from
the
first
tell
me
all
i
have
so
found
him
selling
your
lordship
s
sheep
they
fetched
nearly
pieces
of
gold
answered
the
officer
grimly
he
shall
make
an
excellent
example
for
my
lord
he
is
the
first
whom
we
have
caught
in
this
market
trying
to
sell
without
a
permit
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
have
witnesses
to
it
that
he
proposed
to
take
the
purchase
money
and
perhaps
with
some
accomplice
whom
i
have
not
traced
to
on
hearing
this
my
former
companion
clenching
his
hands
and
showing
as
intense
a
passion
as
his
dignity
would
allow
a
magnificent
figure
in
those
clothes
of
his
my
clothes
cried
what
is
it
possible
that
one
whom
i
have
nourished
tended
and
befriended
should
be
guilty
of
so
abominable
a
crime
how
wise
we
were
to
make
the
regulation
how
excellent
and
zealous
are
you
in
your
office
thus
to
have
found
the
first
culprit
who
attempted
theft
in
this
place
how
admirable
that
he
should
be
brought
to
justice
before
he
could
consummate
his
crime
how
marked
is
the
work
of
providence
here
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
which
has
given
him
up
to
us
for
an
example
come
let
us
cut
off
his
head
with
a
blunt
the
officer
who
had
thus
traitorously
caught
me
bowed
low
and
said
hearing
and
obedience
but
if
my
lord
will
take
council
i
would
what
is
it
you
would
say
said
my
companion
who
resumed
his
seat
but
slowly
and
seemed
displeased
at
the
interruption
my
lord
said
the
official
i
suggest
that
if
you
cut
off
his
miserable
head
with
a
blunt
saw
though
doubtless
it
would
have
a
good
effect
for
the
moment
and
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
those
here
who
see
it
so
that
never
more
shall
sheep
be
stolen
from
this
market
nor
ever
more
shall
we
suffer
as
we
have
suffered
in
the
past
yet
it
would
be
of
slighter
effect
than
what
i
shall
propose
for
to
hear
of
a
man
s
execution
is
one
thing
but
to
hear
his
own
relation
of
his
sufferings
is
another
i
propose
therefore
that
he
shall
be
beaten
at
great
length
but
not
to
the
point
of
death
on
the
approaching
of
that
consummation
let
him
be
released
to
crawl
away
and
tell
his
story
throughout
our
countries
to
whoever
will
listen
such
an
example
would
be
of
far
more
service
to
the
owners
my
lord
than
his
death
would
be
and
i
promise
that
he
shall
be
beaten
in
the
most
expert
manner
to
the
advantage
of
all
even
as
he
advised
so
was
it
done
i
was
given
the
bastinado
without
mercy
until
i
thought
i
should
have
expired
and
then
under
every
circumstance
of
ignominy
i
was
turned
loose
with
a
week
s
provision
of
coarse
meal
into
that
deserted
country
to
spread
terror
among
the
servants
of
the
wealthy
owners
and
by
my
example
to
deter
them
from
ever
attempting
to
play
tricks
with
their
masters
goods
i
who
from
my
youth
have
abhorred
the
ill
use
of
servants
i
who
had
founded
once
so
great
a
fortune
and
proved
so
kind
a
master
to
hosts
of
dependents
i
in
my
ingenuousness
and
simple
heart
could
not
have
believed
that
such
trickery
existed
in
the
world
i
had
been
wholly
duped
as
i
limped
from
village
to
village
begging
my
bread
i
heard
the
whole
story
and
it
exactly
confirmed
the
conclusion
i
had
reached
when
i
first
stood
trembling
before
the
sheiks
at
the
mosque
the
shepherd
in
his
poor
clothes
was
the
richest
sheep
owner
in
the
country
he
and
his
fellow
lords
had
for
some
years
past
suffered
from
surreptitious
sales
they
had
appointed
officers
to
watch
the
markets
and
even
so
had
not
always
been
able
to
recover
the
purchase
money
from
their
agents
they
had
therefore
as
i
guessed
instituted
a
system
of
permits
so
that
no
man
could
sell
in
the
market
without
their
signed
licences
and
so
that
each
man
so
selling
could
be
detected
as
a
thief
by
the
officers
of
the
markets
but
how
should
i
a
poor
stranger
from
know
anything
of
this
the
blackness
of
the
treason
wounded
me
even
more
than
the
sufferings
of
my
bastinado
i
almost
lost
my
faith
in
man
by
the
everlasting
mercy
i
did
not
lose
my
faith
in
heaven
nothing
my
boys
said
the
old
man
his
voice
trembling
as
he
remembered
this
terrible
passage
of
the
past
nothing
but
religion
supported
me
during
the
fearful
days
that
followed
i
think
i
can
say
with
humility
that
one
less
founded
in
a
firm
reliance
upon
his
maker
would
have
grown
embittered
i
might
have
turned
into
one
of
those
useless
people
who
as
the
result
of
misfortune
become
railers
nourishing
a
perpetual
quarrel
against
mankind
but
our
holy
religion
stood
me
in
good
stead
and
as
my
wounds
healed
and
as
my
wanderings
led
me
further
from
the
scene
of
my
torture
i
recovered
so
much
of
my
spirits
as
once
more
to
attempt
what
might
have
seemed
impossible
i
faced
the
world
again
it
would
seem
that
those
for
whom
heaven
has
high
designs
those
for
whom
like
myself
it
intends
the
highest
positions
among
men
must
in
the
divine
scheme
pass
first
through
the
fire
and
the
ordeal
happy
the
men
who
like
myself
profit
by
such
visitations
and
retain
unclouded
their
childlike
trust
in
amen
murmured
the
eldest
of
the
nephews
what
was
that
you
said
cried
mahmoud
sharply
i
said
amen
uncle
answered
the
lad
in
humble
tones
his
uncle
scanned
him
narrowly
well
he
muttered
i
suppose
you
are
too
much
of
a
fool
to
have
meant
it
ill
at
this
the
strident
nasals
of
the
muezzin
suddenly
shrieked
from
the
neighbouring
minaret
and
the
young
lads
with
unaccustomed
rapidity
vacated
the
great
merchant
s
apartment
that
is
the
orchard
chapter
viii
entitled
or
the
orchard
when
mahmoud
s
nephews
reappeared
before
him
at
the
hour
of
public
executions
it
was
in
a
certain
weariness
of
spirit
for
though
they
knew
that
the
fortunes
of
their
uncle
must
subsequently
be
recovered
in
the
narrative
since
there
he
was
before
them
rolling
or
as
the
phrase
went
in
bagdad
dripping
with
it
yet
the
blows
of
fate
had
fallen
upon
him
with
such
violence
in
the
recent
tale
that
something
of
his
then
despair
had
entered
their
own
souls
they
sat
down
therefore
with
hanging
heads
to
listen
as
they
feared
to
little
better
than
the
further
advance
of
intolerable
things
the
old
man
began
in
a
subdued
voice
of
lamentable
recollection
i
wandered
on
through
the
bare
uplands
miserable
weak
penniless
and
in
rags
so
far
had
my
soul
fallen
that
on
the
seventh
day
i
came
near
to
omitting
my
prayer
at
even
but
i
thank
heaven
that
this
temptation
was
conquered
i
knelt
down
painfully
upon
the
little
carpet
which
was
my
last
possession
and
submitted
myself
to
the
will
of
allah
as
though
in
answer
to
my
prayer
and
while
i
still
knelt
there
i
saw
afar
off
the
figure
of
one
who
moved
as
i
could
see
from
that
distance
with
a
carriage
of
leisure
and
i
hoped
i
dared
to
hope
that
in
answer
to
my
prayer
i
will
not
say
a
victim
but
at
any
rate
some
provender
was
to
be
afforded
me
i
hastened
my
steps
to
catch
up
the
stranger
and
as
i
approached
him
remarked
with
pleasure
his
fine
clothes
and
stately
manner
i
have
here
said
i
to
myself
some
important
man
some
one
doubtless
unused
to
the
base
necessities
of
commerce
simple
noble
in
mind
straightforward
generous
amply
provided
the
very
companion
whom
i
should
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
as
i
slackened
my
steps
for
a
moment
so
that
he
should
not
yet
observe
my
arrival
various
schemes
whereby
i
might
excuse
my
intrusion
upon
his
solitary
walk
at
last
i
hit
on
that
which
seemed
to
me
the
most
agreeable
to
his
supposed
circumstances
and
to
my
appearance
i
strode
up
to
him
and
bowing
low
asked
him
whether
his
greatness
could
direct
a
poor
wretch
to
a
certain
village
the
name
of
which
i
had
heard
and
which
lay
more
or
less
in
the
direction
i
had
taken
the
stranger
turned
to
salute
me
and
with
that
i
felt
an
added
delight
for
he
was
the
very
thing
i
had
prayed
young
simple
in
manner
courteous
probably
by
his
dress
independent
and
wealthy
probably
as
our
language
has
it
his
own
he
wore
rare
ornaments
his
cloak
was
of
the
finest
wool
and
the
cord
that
bound
his
headdress
was
interspersed
with
silver
by
way
of
reply
to
my
request
he
told
me
in
a
pleasant
deep
voice
speaking
after
the
fashion
of
the
rich
that
he
was
himself
strolling
towards
it
so
far
as
his
own
house
and
farm
which
lay
between
and
that
there
he
would
put
me
upon
my
way
i
expressed
my
gratitude
and
my
fear
lest
so
bedraggled
a
companion
might
be
distasteful
to
him
he
smiled
and
assured
me
that
he
loved
nothing
better
than
converse
he
had
visited
a
neighbour
that
morning
to
ask
advice
on
a
certain
set
of
pear
trees
of
his
which
had
not
been
doing
well
he
had
left
his
servant
to
follow
him
with
his
mount
preferring
this
hour
s
stroll
back
homewards
in
the
cool
of
the
sunset
hour
which
had
now
descended
as
we
went
we
talked
of
many
things
and
i
frankly
told
him
the
story
of
my
life
for
i
have
discovered
that
nothing
is
more
pleasing
to
men
of
his
station
than
the
account
of
how
another
has
been
reduced
from
wealth
to
poverty
i
was
not
always
said
i
as
i
strolled
by
his
side
the
deplorable
figure
you
now
see
me
indeed
but
a
very
few
months
ago
i
was
the
of
a
great
fruit
plantation
some
hundred
miles
to
the
north
of
this
place
i
had
come
with
good
recommendations
from
my
former
employers
planters
of
the
gulf
i
had
left
these
my
original
masters
with
the
best
of
characters
and
the
kindest
of
recommendations
and
only
because
the
eldest
son
of
one
of
the
partners
had
to
be
put
into
the
business
and
there
was
no
room
for
both
of
us
i
had
accumulated
in
some
years
of
useful
service
a
sufficient
little
capital
which
my
kind
masters
were
so
exceedingly
generous
as
to
double
and
i
was
able
to
put
the
total
sum
into
the
new
business
to
which
i
had
been
recommended
for
it
is
always
better
i
added
to
have
some
stake
in
the
you
are
right
said
my
new
friend
in
hearty
approval
there
is
no
greater
error
than
to
offer
a
firm
such
intangible
things
as
talent
honesty
and
the
rest
valuable
as
they
are
if
they
are
unaccompanied
by
metal
they
are
without
substance
and
with
an
expression
of
great
humility
i
applauded
his
reply
and
told
him
how
flattered
i
was
to
find
that
my
judgment
had
jumped
with
his
but
alas
sir
i
continued
deferentially
there
is
no
controlling
the
current
of
our
destinies
for
there
is
one
above
i
know
i
know
agreed
my
companion
hurriedly
in
the
tones
of
one
to
whom
the
sentiment
was
familiar
and
at
the
same
time
doubtful
and
i
continued
by
that
divine
will
i
went
on
was
i
visited
heaven
saw
fit
to
try
its
servant
in
the
course
of
my
management
i
was
sent
to
negotiate
the
purchase
of
a
cargo
of
at
the
nearest
port
for
use
upon
the
plantation
on
my
way
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
robbed
at
an
inn
of
the
pouch
of
gold
that
had
been
confided
to
me
i
ought
of
course
to
have
returned
at
once
and
told
my
partners
and
employers
what
had
happened
and
to
have
offered
perhaps
to
repair
out
of
my
own
property
what
might
look
like
the
result
of
my
own
negligence
but
i
was
afraid
lest
i
should
not
be
believed
and
again
lest
if
i
were
believed
the
loss
should
prejudice
me
in
their
eyes
as
an
incompetent
what
i
did
was
to
go
forward
to
the
port
that
very
day
penniless
and
trust
to
the
credit
of
my
firm
to
complete
the
transaction
i
had
in
hand
but
once
again
i
was
unfortunate
i
carried
through
the
negotiations
with
success
and
purchased
the
cargo
upon
very
reasonable
terms
i
delayed
to
the
last
moment
the
payment
of
earnest
money
and
then
when
delay
would
no
longer
serve
i
said
carelessly
that
full
payment
would
follow
by
messenger
within
two
days
the
merchant
s
face
darkened
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
led
on
by
false
pretences
roughly
bade
me
begone
and
would
hear
no
more
of
the
transaction
he
refused
to
sign
and
indeed
left
me
abruptly
saying
that
he
was
off
to
seek
another
purchaser
and
telling
me
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
seriously
considering
whether
or
no
to
summon
me
before
the
magistrate
for
having
thus
lost
him
a
whole
day
upon
a
false
pretence
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
i
received
a
summons
from
the
magistrate
that
very
evening
to
attend
his
court
the
next
day
it
was
unfortunate
that
during
the
night
another
theft
took
place
in
the
inn
where
i
lay
the
bundles
of
those
staying
at
the
place
were
searched
my
own
alone
contained
no
valuables
of
any
kind
one
would
have
thought
that
such
a
circumstance
would
have
spoken
in
my
favour
it
was
exactly
the
other
way
it
was
argued
that
a
man
who
will
stay
in
an
inn
without
the
means
of
paying
must
be
a
thief
of
some
sort
and
that
since
the
sum
stolen
was
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
it
was
probably
i
thus
manifestly
suspect
of
trickery
who
was
the
culprit
in
my
fright
i
attempted
to
escape
i
was
caught
and
roughly
handled
with
the
final
result
that
i
appeared
in
the
magistrate
s
court
covered
with
blood
my
garments
torn
and
in
such
a
posture
subjected
to
a
double
accusation
upon
the
part
of
the
innkeeper
and
also
upon
the
part
of
the
foreign
merchant
who
appeared
upon
the
original
charge
in
such
distress
i
had
no
avenue
of
escape
save
a
reference
to
my
honoured
firm
the
name
of
which
though
distant
was
familiar
to
the
court
the
magistrate
expressed
his
doubt
that
i
had
any
connection
with
such
important
people
and
asked
me
if
i
would
risk
the
sending
of
a
messenger
to
my
partners
i
said
i
would
do
so
gladly
but
during
the
two
days
interval
of
the
messenger
s
absence
i
was
closely
confined
in
the
public
prison
where
i
regret
to
say
the
foreign
merchant
had
the
heartlessness
to
come
and
make
faces
at
me
through
the
bars
and
where
having
no
money
to
give
my
gaolers
i
was
treated
with
the
utmost
harshness
my
misfortunes
were
not
at
an
end
as
luck
would
have
it
the
firm
to
which
i
belonged
and
of
whose
books
i
had
the
sole
management
undertook
a
surprise
audit
on
the
very
day
of
my
departure
and
discovered
a
most
serious
deficit
in
one
item
which
the
partners
in
their
ignorance
could
not
account
for
had
i
been
present
i
could
easily
have
explained
what
had
happened
it
was
but
an
advance
which
i
had
made
to
a
customer
whose
transactions
with
us
were
of
the
highest
value
as
much
in
my
own
interests
as
in
those
of
my
partners
i
was
well
justified
in
risking
the
money
i
had
acted
foolishly
perhaps
in
refusing
to
take
a
receipt
or
to
enter
the
matter
in
the
books
but
the
thing
was
only
for
a
week
and
after
so
many
years
of
prosperity
i
could
not
dream
of
so
small
a
thing
turning
out
untowardly
however
there
it
was
my
partners
hurriedly
sent
after
me
and
learned
to
their
dismay
that
i
had
left
the
first
inn
upon
the
road
without
payment
and
giving
no
account
of
my
future
movements
they
had
sent
a
man
on
a
swift
horse
he
had
covered
the
distance
to
the
port
in
twelve
hours
but
as
i
was
now
in
prison
could
discover
nothing
of
me
in
the
town
nor
find
any
cargo
i
had
bought
or
indeed
any
trace
of
me
he
returned
to
my
partners
as
they
had
instructed
him
upon
another
beast
as
swift
having
sold
his
spent
mount
and
it
was
just
as
they
received
this
grave
news
of
my
apparent
absconding
just
while
my
partners
grew
more
and
more
convinced
of
my
supposed
guilt
that
the
messenger
from
the
magistrate
arrived
and
completed
the
accusation
they
answered
not
by
coming
in
person
but
by
sending
a
letter
of
the
most
violent
kind
calling
me
a
notorious
thief
expressing
their
pleasure
that
i
had
been
laid
by
the
heels
and
begging
that
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
magistrate
would
not
spare
me
in
any
punishment
he
might
see
fit
to
inflict
for
my
other
escapades
meanwhile
they
said
they
would
not
trouble
him
to
enter
judgment
for
the
sum
i
had
taken
since
they
had
replaced
it
out
of
my
capital
in
the
firm
which
nearly
or
exactly
made
good
the
deficit
you
may
imagine
my
lord
the
result
of
all
this
the
magistrate
read
the
court
a
sermon
on
the
justice
of
the
law
which
spared
no
man
for
his
rank
or
commerce
and
concluded
you
have
before
you
the
sad
spectacle
of
a
man
of
substance
fallen
through
temptation
into
poverty
and
the
foreign
merchant
contemptuously
waived
his
action
the
innkeeper
with
equal
contempt
expressed
himself
satisfied
with
the
punishment
i
had
already
undergone
claiming
only
my
clothes
by
way
of
payment
giving
me
these
few
rags
in
exchange
with
yet
another
admonition
the
magistrate
dismissed
me
i
went
out
from
the
court
a
broken
man
wandered
aimlessly
southward
doing
a
little
work
here
and
there
upon
the
farms
and
i
am
now
seeking
the
next
village
with
the
object
of
offering
my
services
such
sir
i
concluded
is
my
tale
here
am
i
with
every
commercial
aptitude
and
full
training
in
the
various
transactions
of
business
but
especially
in
the
management
of
plantations
for
no
fault
of
my
own
unable
to
exercise
these
talents
rehabilitate
my
character
and
recover
my
position
in
the
rich
young
man
was
deeply
touched
by
my
story
every
word
of
which
i
am
glad
to
say
he
seemed
to
believe
for
i
was
not
deceived
in
my
reading
of
character
and
i
had
rightly
guessed
that
a
man
under
thirty
and
clearly
enjoying
leisure
and
wealth
would
be
singularly
open
to
the
reception
of
any
romantic
tale
that
might
be
offered
to
him
it
is
indeed
fortunate
he
answered
that
you
understand
plantations
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
am
for
the
moment
interested
i
have
an
orchard
which
is
not
doing
he
had
evidently
forgotten
his
first
sentence
on
our
meeting
which
had
given
me
my
clue
but
rich
and
generous
natures
are
like
that
in
early
youth
hence
also
are
they
bad
players
in
games
of
skill
come
with
me
he
continued
and
pass
the
night
in
my
house
yonder
it
already
lay
before
us
in
the
hollow
the
conversation
on
your
past
life
which
is
doubtless
full
of
adventures
will
entertain
me
at
my
meal
i
will
see
that
you
have
occupation
upon
my
farm
and
after
a
short
experiment
i
think
we
shall
get
along
very
well
indeed
together
particularly
as
i
have
recently
planted
by
way
of
experiment
a
number
of
pear
trees
which
as
i
think
i
just
told
you
are
not
doing
well
i
thought
myself
able
from
my
general
knowledge
to
conduct
this
orchard
but
i
regret
to
say
that
some
of
the
trees
have
died
and
that
the
rest
are
in
a
poor
way
i
evidently
lack
the
special
experience
required
since
plantations
are
your
special
line
you
may
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
me
in
this
little
here
my
dear
nephews
i
was
in
something
of
a
quandary
this
i
am
told
is
a
difficulty
we
men
of
affairs
come
across
often
enough
in
the
conduct
of
our
negotiations
it
is
our
duty
as
i
need
hardly
tell
you
to
add
details
of
a
corroborative
kind
to
the
statements
we
have
to
make
in
affairs
to
omit
any
detail
is
to
court
suspicion
on
the
other
hand
one
never
knows
where
the
most
necessary
fictions
may
lead
one
here
i
was
confronted
by
the
task
of
bringing
to
fruition
an
orchard
an
orchard
of
pears
and
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
orchards
and
of
pears
far
less
i
replied
therefore
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
that
the
opportunity
was
exactly
what
i
should
have
desired
orchards
were
the
kind
of
plantation
i
had
most
carefully
studied
and
of
all
fruits
were
those
upon
which
i
had
specialised
most
once
i
had
seen
the
kind
of
tree
my
kind
host
had
planted
i
should
certainly
be
able
to
tell
him
what
was
the
matter
it
was
almost
dark
when
we
came
to
his
enclosure
but
so
eager
was
he
on
his
new
idea
that
he
led
me
at
once
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
trees
were
planted
very
sickly
indeed
did
their
gaunt
twigs
look
in
the
gloaming
a
good
third
of
them
were
shrivelled
and
dead
the
rest
drooped
in
various
degrees
one
only
gave
a
promise
of
fruit
out
of
some
three
hundred
stems
the
rich
man
surveyed
the
ruin
and
gazed
at
me
anxiously
while
i
held
my
chin
in
my
hand
as
though
meditating
upon
the
best
course
for
him
to
pursue
but
in
reality
considering
my
own
then
it
was
my
dear
infants
that
i
received
from
on
high
one
of
those
illuminations
which
have
always
been
with
me
the
forerunners
of
great
things
i
deliberately
kept
the
rich
young
man
waiting
for
the
space
of
a
long
prayer
and
then
said
suddenly
and
with
determination
scrap
the
lot
excuse
me
i
added
i
have
used
a
phrase
current
in
the
barbaric
cities
of
the
north
which
is
somewhat
corrupt
in
speech
my
intention
was
to
express
to
your
highness
my
conviction
formed
upon
this
rapid
survey
in
gathering
darkness
that
the
orchard
can
no
longer
be
saved
for
i
am
sure
my
judgment
will
be
confirmed
when
i
make
a
more
thorough
examination
morning
in
broad
day
i
see
also
even
in
this
light
that
the
type
of
tree
you
have
planted
is
wholly
unsuited
to
the
climate
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
where
you
purchased
the
stock
i
was
assured
answered
my
new
friend
a
little
shamefacedly
that
it
was
stock
grown
within
this
very
region
and
peculiarly
adapted
for
our
dry
climate
for
the
drought
of
our
position
which
as
you
know
stands
too
high
for
i
shook
my
head
you
were
deceived
said
i
who
sold
you
this
unsuitable
stock
he
told
me
that
it
was
a
sound
friend
of
his
who
had
gone
off
for
a
while
upon
a
journey
that
he
was
quite
sure
he
had
not
intended
to
deceive
perhaps
there
was
some
error
in
the
consignment
shipped
to
you
i
answered
cheerfully
as
we
turned
towards
the
house
this
kind
does
admirably
in
the
river
lowlands
and
i
take
it
your
friend
s
servants
by
some
mistake
sent
your
consignment
to
some
lowland
client
and
to
in
these
uplands
anyhow
the
orchard
is
manifestly
doomed
as
you
can
see
and
for
my
part
i
make
no
doubt
that
the
trouble
has
come
from
the
use
of
a
wrong
species
now
what
you
want
here
i
continued
rapidly
turning
over
my
chances
well
in
my
mind
and
plumping
for
technical
terms
is
a
pear
neither
palinate
nor
sublongate
nor
for
that
matter
perforate
but
daxullic
or
as
we
sometimes
call
it
in
the
trade
retarded
at
any
rate
in
the
second
and
third
i
see
i
understand
i
apprehend
said
the
rich
young
man
for
thus
have
i
discovered
do
rich
young
men
carry
on
a
conversation
which
leaves
them
entirely
at
sea
i
do
not
i
hastened
to
add
insist
of
course
upon
the
persian
stock
though
that
is
the
best
it
might
be
difficult
to
procure
and
it
is
expensive
what
i
mean
is
something
of
the
same
family
i
should
advise
as
a
stock
more
easily
purchased
in
the
local
markets
the
pear
called
by
the
merchants
the
glory
of
it
was
introduced
some
few
years
ago
by
my
friend
nasredin
and
is
now
a
favourite
stock
on
the
plateau
of
reshed
where
the
climate
is
very
similar
to
yours
it
bears
a
large
luscious
fruit
highly
marketable
and
maturing
early
and
it
can
be
purchased
at
a
moderate
expense
i
will
if
you
like
go
for
you
to
the
nearest
provider
of
such
things
and
see
what
i
can
my
host
thanked
me
profusely
he
remarked
how
small
the
world
was
and
at
the
same
time
how
manifest
were
the
workings
of
providence
he
blessed
the
day
when
he
had
met
me
for
though
he
said
the
matter
of
expense
did
not
weigh
upon
him
he
had
made
a
particular
point
of
success
in
the
matter
of
pear
trees
and
but
for
my
advice
he
really
did
not
know
what
he
should
have
done
he
was
so
keen
upon
the
affair
that
he
pressed
me
to
start
for
the
nearest
nurseryman
the
very
next
morning
there
was
an
excellent
nursery
plantation
he
said
not
more
than
half
a
day
s
ride
away
to
the
west
it
stood
with
the
owner
s
house
in
the
midst
just
outside
the
gates
of
the
town
to
which
he
would
direct
me
either
going
himself
or
sending
his
bailiff
with
me
he
would
also
send
a
wagon
for
the
conveyance
of
the
young
shoots
indeed
as
the
meal
progressed
for
we
were
now
dining
he
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
on
the
matter
and
could
hardly
bear
the
delay
of
the
night
i
saw
which
way
the
land
lay
and
saw
fit
to
increase
his
keenness
i
therefore
told
him
it
was
quite
impossible
to
act
with
such
speed
the
young
shoots
said
i
must
not
be
left
to
lie
untended
and
unplanted
we
must
first
of
all
prepare
the
ground
the
old
trees
must
be
dug
up
the
pits
enlarged
it
is
the
narrowness
of
the
earthing
that
has
been
half
your
trouble
for
the
smaller
root
tendrils
which
we
call
trips
are
easily
estopped
in
hard
i
see
said
he
sapiently
the
ground
must
be
well
soaked
i
continued
and
manured
with
a
full
dressing
of
lime
and
only
when
all
this
has
been
completed
could
i
think
of
advising
you
to
i
paused
to
concoct
something
new
and
the
amiable
youth
filled
the
gap
for
me
by
murmuring
precisely
exactly
now
i
i
resumed
further
we
must
underpin
the
runners
and
work
up
the
earth
and
then
there
is
the
daubing
it
will
be
a
matter
of
full
three
days
work
on
the
fourth
day
i
can
set
out
before
sunrise
you
may
take
it
that
i
will
be
back
by
evening
and
we
will
if
you
please
plant
the
very
next
morning
that
is
on
the
fifth
day
lest
the
stock
should
suffer
for
i
have
always
found
it
i
added
profoundly
of
invariable
service
to
plant
immediately
i
have
indeed
lost
in
the
past
one
or
two
most
valuable
sets
of
trees
trees
by
delaying
at
this
season
of
the
year
so
much
as
hours
before
putting
them
in
the
as
i
thus
spoke
he
nodded
frequently
admiring
my
talent
and
knowledge
of
these
affairs
and
i
took
occasion
as
evening
wore
on
to
ground
him
yet
more
deeply
in
this
fascinating
subject
which
i
had
already
begun
to
feel
was
mine
the
next
day
with
the
first
of
the
light
we
both
of
us
set
out
to
the
orchard
he
summoned
his
workmen
and
our
labours
engrossed
us
for
many
hours
during
which
i
fed
his
enthusiasm
with
renewed
tales
of
marvels
in
the
way
of
and
especially
of
pear
trees
that
particular
pear
called
the
glory
of
heaven
increased
wonderfully
as
i
proceeded
until
at
last
it
had
grown
to
such
a
size
that
each
individual
fruit
was
as
large
as
a
child
s
head
and
half
a
dozen
of
them
would
fetch
a
piece
of
gold
if
i
was
careful
to
add
if
they
are
properly
packed
for
i
regret
to
say
that
simple
as
the
detail
is
the
neglect
of
good
packing
has
been
the
ruin
of
most
speculators
in
this
during
the
second
day
of
our
labours
i
dilated
upon
other
details
of
the
trade
which
occurred
to
me
as
i
went
along
i
especially
insisted
upon
what
i
called
the
and
for
this
he
was
all
ears
there
is
a
limit
i
said
to
your
plantation
after
which
the
expenses
of
management
begin
to
eat
into
the
profits
earned
a
first
small
speculation
of
trees
such
as
you
have
here
is
of
course
a
mere
bagatelle
it
would
provide
you
with
amusement
but
no
appreciable
income
the
most
profitable
size
of
orchard
is
far
larger
in
such
a
situation
as
yours
said
i
looking
round
with
an
air
of
a
connoisseur
and
with
such
soil
as
this
and
with
that
i
took
up
a
clod
and
carefully
crumbled
it
in
my
fingers
possessing
acidulated
properties
of
this
type
but
corrected
by
some
slow
exhaust
of
porphyritic
matter
it
would
need
but
a
top
dressing
of
bardulm
and
an
occasional
picketing
of
charcoal
to
make
some
trees
produce
a
regular
annual
profit
of
not
less
than
pieces
of
gold
and
that
upon
an
original
expenditure
less
than
double
the
amount
i
would
estimate
your
return
with
care
and
good
fortune
at
quite
fifty
per
but
at
any
rate
you
could
calculate
upon
thirty
per
cent
but
than
trees
said
i
musing
would
i
fear
be
an
error
the
earnings
after
that
get
eaten
into
by
he
interrupted
me
with
the
eager
words
i
should
be
happy
i
lifted
my
hand
to
check
him
and
said
no
i
assure
you
that
even
such
a
number
as
would
be
just
beyond
the
line
and
as
you
approach
you
would
find
the
expense
absorbing
nearly
all
your
profit
it
is
as
great
an
error
to
these
things
as
to
starve
them
let
us
fix
the
number
at
and
the
capital
expenditure
at
pieces
of
gold
then
i
think
you
will
not
be
the
third
day
i
spent
overlooking
the
levelling
of
the
ground
and
its
last
preparation
as
also
in
making
mysterious
marks
with
little
pegs
and
jotting
down
notes
in
a
book
all
of
which
excited
the
owner
to
the
last
degree
and
left
him
as
the
phrase
goes
with
his
tongue
hanging
out
for
the
new
trees
that
evening
my
kind
host
after
some
little
embarrassment
made
me
an
offer
would
i
he
asked
share
in
the
profits
of
the
enterprise
i
at
once
refused
my
decision
surprised
him
but
as
he
pressed
the
project
upon
me
i
told
him
that
gratitude
was
only
a
part
of
my
decision
i
owed
him
everything
he
had
found
me
it
seemed
a
month
ago
indeed
though
it
was
but
three
days
in
rags
he
had
clothed
me
fed
me
and
what
was
more
trusted
me
his
trust
i
assured
him
would
not
be
deceived
i
shall
be
content
i
concluded
with
the
salary
proper
to
my
position
he
at
once
mentioned
a
sum
which
i
halved
but
i
will
go
so
far
as
this
if
upon
the
opening
of
the
fourth
year
your
profits
shall
be
found
to
have
what
i
have
suggested
if
you
make
in
the
three
years
more
than
pieces
of
gold
at
pieces
a
year
which
i
suggest
as
the
probable
result
i
will
accept
though
reluctantly
one
half
of
the
excess
for
i
am
confident
and
here
i
put
an
especially
serious
tone
into
my
voice
that
we
shall
do
better
than
i
have
said
i
have
ever
held
it
my
duty
to
give
a
conservative
estimate
and
to
avoid
the
disappointment
of
those
who
employ
me
to
this
among
other
things
do
i
ascribe
the
great
success
which
attended
me
during
my
earlier
years
and
which
only
failed
me
through
the
deplorable
accidents
i
related
to
you
on
our
first
my
host
appeared
a
little
confused
at
my
probity
or
rather
at
my
scruples
but
he
told
me
that
he
had
always
found
such
errors
to
be
upon
the
right
side
and
assured
me
that
i
should
not
lose
by
the
austerity
of
my
temper
nor
did
i
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
looking
at
the
illuminations
in
his
fine
library
i
expressed
myself
enthralled
by
them
all
i
lingered
with
especial
care
over
every
representation
of
an
orchard
in
these
pictures
and
spoke
in
the
most
learned
manner
of
the
various
fruits
therein
displayed
as
luck
would
have
it
we
came
to
one
particularly
fine
painting
in
which
were
delineated
the
most
enormous
pears
of
a
brilliant
golden
hue
interspersed
with
soft
leaves
this
i
cried
delightedly
is
the
very
fruit
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
how
interesting
how
exciting
is
that
so
said
my
host
transported
at
the
coincidence
once
more
i
must
say
it
how
small
is
the
world
yes
said
i
it
is
that
pear
glory
of
heaven
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
and
which
you
may
see
by
comparison
with
the
insects
here
portrayed
and
of
the
trellis
work
to
be
most
enormous
fruit
of
its
succulence
i
must
leave
you
to
judge
when
you
shall
gather
your
first
harvest
of
its
highly
saleable
quality
in
the
markets
of
the
north
you
will
i
trust
soon
have
satisfactory
i
shall
indeed
said
my
host
now
quite
beside
himself
with
the
combined
emotions
of
the
collector
and
the
man
of
property
he
blessed
again
and
again
the
day
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
such
a
man
as
myself
summoning
his
bailiff
he
gave
orders
for
the
wagon
to
be
prepared
over
night
and
the
horses
to
be
ready
by
sunrise
no
no
said
i
an
hour
before
sunrise
if
you
please
i
am
determined
at
whatever
inconvenience
to
myself
to
have
the
plants
back
here
at
your
house
on
the
night
of
the
same
day
i
will
risk
no
failure
in
this
great
affair
again
he
blessed
and
thanked
me
and
when
his
dependents
were
dismissed
took
me
aside
and
prepared
to
count
out
the
money
which
would
be
required
for
my
expenditure
you
said
pieces
of
gold
said
he
as
he
disposed
the
coins
in
little
heaps
of
ten
upon
the
table
you
had
better
make
it
for
there
may
have
been
fluctuations
in
the
market
since
you
last
purchased
and
it
is
good
that
you
should
have
a
i
told
him
i
thought
the
provision
a
wise
one
but
that
i
would
account
for
every
penny
when
he
should
next
see
me
and
this
curiously
enough
was
my
true
intention
though
i
could
not
have
given
him
any
very
exact
date
for
our
next
meeting
i
wrote
him
out
a
formal
receipt
in
spite
of
his
protests
remarking
that
business
was
business
and
so
that
every
formality
should
be
accomplished
i
signed
the
document
in
the
name
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
one
i
said
i
would
further
have
affixed
my
seal
had
i
possessed
one
but
placed
as
i
was
no
such
instrument
was
available
the
ball
of
your
thumb
will
do
said
the
young
man
carelessly
his
words
brought
me
up
rather
sharp
and
it
was
not
without
trepidation
that
i
acceded
to
this
chance
request
but
once
more
the
inspiration
of
heaven
served
me
i
dexterously
substituted
my
middle
finger
for
my
thumb
as
i
pressed
the
wax
thereunder
this
arrangement
said
the
old
merchant
as
he
crossed
the
two
fingers
in
the
presence
of
his
nephews
by
way
of
illustration
i
recommend
you
upon
every
occasion
of
life
it
is
especially
useful
in
those
tyrannical
countries
where
the
police
take
the
of
innocent
wayfarers
i
have
used
it
a
dozen
times
but
to
return
to
my
tale
i
pattered
on
to
my
kind
host
as
i
pressed
my
finger
down
and
thus
distracted
his
attention
from
too
close
a
watch
on
my
hand
this
thumb
mark
said
i
releasing
my
middle
finger
from
the
wax
this
thumb
mark
is
as
good
as
any
signature
i
think
for
allah
has
made
it
the
sign
manual
of
all
honest
men
no
two
are
alike
remember
pray
i
added
laughingly
that
it
was
the
thumb
of
my
i
will
said
he
laughing
in
turn
as
you
say
these
are
mere
formalities
i
do
not
think
the
less
of
you
for
your
insistence
upon
their
with
these
words
we
parted
in
the
greatest
mutual
satisfaction
he
to
dream
of
this
fine
new
plantation
and
his
coming
wealth
but
i
to
pour
out
my
soul
in
prayer
to
my
maker
and
humbly
to
ask
for
further
guidance
next
morning
while
it
was
yet
dark
i
rose
and
mounted
the
bailiff
at
my
side
and
the
slaves
taking
the
wagons
behind
early
as
was
the
hour
my
kind
host
was
astir
he
gave
me
his
blessing
for
the
tenth
time
on
my
departure
and
poured
out
petitions
for
my
safe
return
i
hung
the
pouch
of
gold
to
my
saddle
bow
where
i
securely
fastened
it
i
took
the
weapon
with
which
he
had
kindly
provided
me
in
case
of
any
misadventure
by
the
road
and
left
him
under
the
benediction
of
god
i
thought
a
little
sadly
as
we
rode
out
in
silence
through
the
gate
and
out
on
to
the
bare
uplands
again
how
transitory
were
all
human
affections
how
short
had
been
this
episode
of
friendship
and
hospitality
how
brief
even
in
the
short
course
of
one
human
life
are
these
passages
of
complete
confidence
and
brotherly
kindness
when
should
we
meet
again
of
my
journey
there
is
little
to
be
related
we
plodded
on
our
pace
necessarily
determined
by
that
of
the
slow
wagon
following
us
and
my
mind
still
turned
upon
what
my
future
action
should
be
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
nephews
allah
had
vouchsafed
me
no
revelation
in
spite
of
my
earnest
prayers
during
the
night
and
i
was
still
considering
what
turn
i
should
give
to
the
affair
when
once
more
that
infinite
mercy
which
has
never
failed
me
or
at
any
rate
only
for
some
short
few
days
and
even
so
but
to
chastise
my
pride
came
to
my
rescue
there
are
in
this
country
deep
gullies
called
the
course
of
streams
which
run
but
rarely
on
these
heights
but
which
when
they
run
dig
their
channels
deeply
into
the
friable
soil
the
crossing
of
these
gullies
by
any
rolling
vehicle
is
something
of
a
business
as
we
reached
one
therefore
they
came
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
miles
the
bailiff
and
i
were
careful
to
dismount
and
help
the
slaves
with
the
wheels
it
was
while
thus
engaged
during
our
careful
drop
into
the
second
that
the
inspiration
from
on
high
flashed
into
my
brain
i
perceived
that
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
were
fastened
to
the
hub
with
wooden
pins
one
of
which
at
the
wheel
which
i
was
holding
back
looked
a
little
loose
the
slaves
had
their
backs
turned
to
me
holding
back
the
front
wheels
and
checking
the
horses
at
the
other
hind
wheel
with
the
body
of
the
front
wagon
between
us
and
concealing
his
view
from
mine
strained
and
heaved
the
bailiff
a
fat
elderly
rogue
unaccustomed
to
such
work
i
pulled
out
the
pin
threw
it
into
the
depths
of
the
neighbouring
scrub
and
as
i
did
so
continued
to
cry
steady
there
steady
so
hold
hard
that
s
better
stand
by
and
other
words
of
the
sort
which
showed
my
interest
in
the
operation
i
could
see
the
wheel
wobbling
as
we
crossed
the
flat
bed
of
the
at
the
foot
of
the
far
rise
it
was
nearly
off
the
time
had
come
now
i
cried
suddenly
whip
up
the
horses
and
shove
the
whips
cracked
the
slaves
hauled
at
the
traces
the
horses
strained
up
went
the
wagon
off
came
the
wheel
and
the
whole
collapsed
upon
one
side
with
a
great
din
and
with
a
sharp
cracking
as
though
something
had
given
way
and
so
it
proved
to
be
for
the
main
axle
though
not
snapped
had
split
so
there
we
were
with
the
wagon
out
of
service
for
the
moment
the
axle
unsure
a
hind
wheel
off
and
the
whole
contraption
on
its
side
the
bailiff
was
seriously
disturbed
it
seemed
that
my
kind
host
was
a
firm
master
that
he
had
his
moments
of
sharp
temper
and
the
bailiff
bewailed
his
fate
and
considered
what
awaited
him
on
his
return
i
laughed
and
reassured
him
come
come
said
i
it
is
no
great
matter
i
understand
these
things
do
you
ride
on
towards
the
town
i
will
help
the
slaves
put
back
the
wheel
we
will
make
some
sort
of
jury
pin
to
put
into
the
hub
we
will
tie
a
rope
round
the
cracked
axle
and
all
will
be
well
we
are
men
enough
between
us
to
repair
the
wagon
but
you
as
i
say
ride
forward
i
shall
soon
catch
you
the
bailiff
was
relieved
at
this
proof
of
my
efficiency
and
good
will
and
delighted
to
be
released
from
the
work
to
which
he
was
quite
unused
he
rode
on
at
a
moderate
pace
while
the
slaves
and
i
heaved
the
wagon
back
upright
i
fashioned
a
jury
pin
out
of
a
piece
of
the
scrub
and
i
was
careful
to
make
it
too
weak
for
its
work
we
bound
a
piece
of
rope
round
the
axle
and
when
all
this
was
done
i
bade
them
go
forward
carefully
lest
a
further
accident
should
befall
i
then
rode
on
smartly
to
catch
up
the
bailiff
who
had
by
this
time
got
about
a
mile
ahead
as
i
neared
him
i
looked
back
from
an
intervening
rise
of
land
it
was
as
i
had
anticipated
the
jury
pin
had
given
way
and
the
wagon
was
on
its
side
again
but
the
lift
of
land
soon
hid
it
from
me
and
down
on
the
further
slope
i
caught
up
the
bailiff
ambling
along
the
wagon
is
all
right
said
i
but
it
will
have
to
go
rather
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
content
thanks
be
said
he
truly
you
are
a
genius
not
at
all
said
i
modestly
it
is
quite
a
small
accident
and
of
a
sort
to
which
i
am
accustomed
but
do
you
ride
back
now
that
everything
is
well
for
the
slaves
are
uneducated
men
this
sort
of
flattery
is
honey
to
bailiffs
and
will
need
some
one
of
your
standing
to
moderate
their
pace
and
to
check
their
horses
and
to
see
that
the
wagon
comes
on
in
good
condition
go
very
carefully
for
the
axle
is
weak
when
you
shall
reach
the
town
we
will
get
a
proper
pin
and
have
everything
put
right
in
an
hour
or
two
meanwhile
i
will
go
forward
and
we
will
make
an
appointment
at
the
market
gardener
s
which
you
will
reach
i
think
some
of
an
hour
after
myself
for
we
are
now
i
take
it
some
couple
of
hours
from
the
you
are
right
said
the
bailiff
you
have
but
to
follow
the
track
and
we
will
come
after
with
that
he
turned
back
once
i
had
seen
him
disappear
behind
the
rise
of
the
hill
i
dug
my
spurs
sharply
into
my
poor
horse
and
went
at
top
speed
across
the
i
am
a
poor
rider
and
had
not
my
saddle
been
ample
and
my
stirrups
weighty
i
should
have
fallen
but
providence
was
with
me
once
again
i
came
through
a
gap
of
rocks
and
saw
immediately
before
and
below
me
the
white
domes
and
flat
roofs
of
a
large
city
and
just
outside
the
gate
a
fine
plantation
of
young
fruit
trees
which
i
recognized
as
the
nursery
gardener
s
i
had
ridden
past
his
house
and
grounds
and
admired
the
young
pear
trees
especially
a
fine
collection
when
a
useful
thought
occurred
to
me
and
i
acted
on
it
at
once
eager
though
i
was
to
save
time
i
turned
back
and
said
to
the
slave
at
the
gate
of
the
plantation
i
have
a
message
for
your
master
tell
him
that
if
any
one
asks
for
he
has
bidden
me
say
that
he
went
back
by
a
short
cut
to
help
his
companions
with
a
broken
i
then
turned
again
and
rode
off
towards
the
city
walls
i
approached
the
town
and
rode
through
the
gate
with
dignity
in
the
new
fine
clothes
the
young
lord
had
given
me
i
nodded
in
a
superior
manner
to
the
guard
and
made
straight
for
the
opposite
entrance
to
the
city
a
horse
fair
was
proceeding
i
put
up
mine
at
an
inn
took
off
the
bag
of
gold
which
was
heavy
but
not
too
heavy
to
be
carried
walked
towards
the
market
and
asked
where
i
could
best
purchase
a
horse
the
name
of
a
was
given
me
i
approached
him
failed
to
believe
all
that
he
told
me
with
regard
to
the
beast
he
offered
but
said
it
would
be
enough
for
my
purpose
i
had
not
an
idea
whither
to
fly
yet
fly
i
must
for
sooner
or
later
the
bailiff
or
my
late
master
himself
must
follow
i
knew
nothing
of
the
country
nor
the
names
of
its
towns
nor
of
the
roads
i
took
refuge
in
a
piece
of
diplomacy
as
i
paid
for
the
horse
i
said
to
the
seller
that
i
had
to
reach
my
mother
s
house
in
the
next
city
before
sundown
and
that
i
hoped
my
purchase
was
able
to
carry
me
that
far
in
the
remaining
half
a
day
s
riding
answered
the
merchant
in
astonishment
i
know
not
how
you
ride
if
you
mean
the
town
of
taftah
it
is
not
more
than
three
hours
going
for
any
reasonable
is
that
so
said
i
in
surprise
i
am
a
stranger
and
i
can
only
believe
what
i
was
told
but
you
know
how
vague
these
country
people
are
i
was
assured
that
this
was
the
road
to
taftah
and
here
i
pointed
through
the
eastern
gate
yes
that
is
the
road
he
said
you
can
easily
reach
your
mother
s
house
before
evening
upon
this
beast
he
said
clapping
its
crupper
without
doubt
you
will
be
there
long
before
the
prayer
and
god
be
with
you
hassan
for
incidentally
it
was
as
hassan
that
i
had
done
business
with
him
i
paid
him
ten
pieces
of
gold
for
the
beast
it
was
more
than
it
was
worth
i
humbly
repeated
his
prayer
which
i
felt
did
apply
with
peculiar
force
to
me
now
for
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
once
more
under
the
beneficent
guidance
of
heaven
who
could
not
be
with
that
heavy
pouch
now
hanging
again
on
his
saddle
i
rode
out
therefore
confidently
quite
careless
whether
i
killed
the
beast
or
no
in
my
rapid
progress
and
brought
it
into
taftah
well
within
three
hours
in
such
a
state
that
i
was
delighted
to
find
a
purchaser
to
whom
i
gave
my
name
as
abdurram
and
my
profession
as
that
of
a
leather
dresser
who
offered
but
five
pieces
of
gold
i
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
horse
and
him
at
that
time
still
pressed
i
might
be
traced
i
knew
not
what
accidents
had
occurred
upon
the
road
behind
me
whether
indeed
those
poor
fools
had
managed
to
mend
the
wagon
again
if
not
whether
the
bailiff
would
have
the
courage
to
tell
his
master
or
ride
on
to
find
me
in
the
first
town
if
he
had
so
ridden
on
he
might
find
evidences
of
my
departure
and
even
more
doubtfully
of
my
second
horse
and
its
purchase
but
though
time
pressed
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
show
any
too
great
speed
i
therefore
sauntered
very
gradually
in
my
fine
clothes
afoot
bearing
my
pouch
in
my
hand
concealed
under
the
fold
of
my
garment
until
i
reached
a
gathering
of
merchants
outside
a
sort
of
exchange
which
this
town
of
taftah
boasted
like
others
of
the
neighbourhood
in
the
vicinity
of
the
governor
s
palace
it
was
there
that
during
a
conversation
which
for
all
my
anxiety
i
took
care
to
make
slow
and
dignified
i
learned
how
were
in
great
demand
in
a
large
city
called
laknes
about
two
weeks
journey
beyond
the
hills
it
was
to
a
business
man
like
myself
a
most
fascinating
story
that
i
heard
the
people
of
that
far
country
were
passionately
fond
of
dates
and
gave
that
fruit
the
briskest
market
imaginable
their
appetite
had
grown
all
the
more
formidable
since
the
next
people
immediately
beyond
them
had
passed
a
law
prohibiting
the
culture
and
sale
of
all
dates
on
account
of
the
toothache
sometimes
arising
from
that
fruit
with
this
reduction
of
supply
laknes
became
more
of
a
bidder
for
dates
than
ever
great
rewards
were
offered
to
any
taking
the
fruit
to
such
a
market
the
last
advices
not
a
month
old
quoted
thirty
dinars
the
kantar
and
were
rising
the
merchants
designed
to
despatch
a
caravan
the
day
after
the
morrow
with
equal
leisure
and
dignity
i
left
them
after
this
little
talk
and
made
it
my
immediate
business
in
the
next
to
procure
with
the
capital
at
my
disposal
a
number
of
camels
and
a
couple
of
bales
of
dates
for
each
together
with
a
few
slaves
that
should
conduct
the
caravan
to
its
destination
i
also
hired
a
free
man
for
a
leader
as
he
was
acquainted
with
the
road
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
dark
i
had
given
orders
in
order
to
conceal
my
movements
that
i
should
not
start
till
late
in
the
week
but
i
had
also
given
a
child
a
small
coin
to
come
up
to
me
upon
a
signal
with
a
piece
of
paper
folded
upon
which
indeed
nothing
was
written
just
as
the
camels
were
being
driven
off
to
their
litter
i
signalled
to
the
child
who
ran
up
and
gave
me
the
note
i
opened
it
before
the
head
man
put
on
an
air
of
great
perturbation
and
said
this
message
changes
all
my
plans
i
fear
i
disturb
you
but
will
you
start
out
willingly
said
he
we
have
provisions
and
i
know
a
good
place
on
the
road
where
we
can
purchase
more
the
weather
is
warm
and
if
your
business
demands
haste
it
may
be
better
to
march
during
the
the
slaves
who
were
not
consulted
were
no
doubt
agreeable
enough
we
set
out
and
all
that
night
went
our
way
it
was
a
monotonous
journey
through
an
arid
land
with
few
towns
or
villages
sufficient
watering
but
no
more
though
i
pressed
the
pace
we
lost
no
beasts
and
on
the
twelfth
day
with
the
cool
of
the
evening
we
reached
laknes
my
camels
were
parked
i
took
my
place
in
the
chief
inn
of
the
city
under
the
name
of
merchant
and
my
first
act
before
ordering
a
meal
was
again
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
to
thank
allah
for
the
return
of
his
mercies
my
capital
was
indeed
nearly
exhausted
i
had
but
a
few
pieces
of
gold
left
in
my
garment
and
the
pouch
was
empty
but
there
was
my
solid
row
of
camels
and
my
fine
cargo
of
dates
i
made
no
doubt
i
should
sell
at
a
good
profit
next
day
and
that
my
career
was
once
more
launched
i
took
care
to
speak
to
all
openly
of
my
arrival
to
hint
at
my
wealth
to
make
all
familiar
with
the
name
of
a
merchant
in
dates
which
it
was
proposed
to
offer
next
day
in
the
market
for
there
are
occasions
my
dear
nephews
in
commerce
when
it
is
perfectly
advisable
to
tell
the
truth
and
even
to
spread
it
with
these
unexpected
words
the
merchant
mahmoud
suddenly
ceased
his
tale
for
the
shriek
of
the
muezzin
was
heard
rending
the
air
the
nephews
rose
and
bowed
we
trust
said
the
eldest
that
when
we
next
appear
we
shall
find
you
my
dear
uncle
climbing
from
greatness
to
greatness
in
the
story
you
still
have
to
alas
my
children
answered
the
venerable
sage
i
fear
you
must
hear
of
other
disappointments
before
the
goal
is
reached
at
this
the
youngest
boy
put
forth
his
lower
lip
which
trembled
and
began
screwing
up
his
eyes
stop
said
the
merchant
testily
stop
my
little
fellow
i
have
had
enough
of
this
oh
uncle
sobbed
the
boy
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
perhaps
all
that
new
wealth
will
be
stolen
from
stop
i
say
shouted
mahmoud
angrily
and
i
tell
you
i
have
had
enough
of
it
i
appreciate
your
motive
i
admire
your
judgment
it
is
marvellous
in
so
young
a
child
but
i
can
not
be
disturbed
with
useless
tears
at
things
so
long
past
you
show
too
great
a
sympathy
you
are
too
sensitive
my
the
child
saluted
assumed
a
more
equable
appearance
and
followed
his
brothers
out
of
the
room
while
mahmoud
his
equipoise
a
little
disturbed
by
the
incident
set
himself
right
by
the
simple
process
of
drawing
from
one
sleeve
a
handful
of
coins
and
counting
them
out
slowly
into
the
other
a
pastime
which
never
failed
to
restore
him
to
the
best
of
tempers

than

i
have
attained
to
the
possession
of
a
palace
and
of
innumerable
slaves
having
so
spoken
the
aged
merchant
bent
for
a
moment
in
silent
prayer
and
then
proceeded
you
will
remember
that
at
the
conclusion
of
my
last
adventure
i
had
reached
a
position
not
of
affluence
but
at
least
of
tolerable
fortune
i
was
possessed
of
a
train
of
camels
each
heavily
laden
with
two
large
panniers
of
dates
and
drivers
to
conduct
the
whole
you
will
further
remember
how
on
my
arrival
in
laknes
as
i
was
anxious
to
make
the
best
of
my
time
i
spoke
freely
to
all
of
my
merchandise
extolled
its
character
described
how
i
intended
to
put
it
up
for
sale
next
day
in
the
public
markets
and
spread
abroad
the
name
of
which
happened
for
the
moment
to
be
mine
the
rumour
spread
as
i
had
intended
it
should
i
strolled
through
the
narrow
streets
of
the
town
after
sunset
and
was
glad
to
hear
my
arrival
discussed
and
my
wares
i
had
promise
for
the
morrow
i
returned
to
my
men
i
had
already
spread
out
my
bed
upon
the
corner
of
the
yard
when
there
came
up
a
slave
magnificently
dressed
who
bowed
to
the
ground
and
approaching
my
presence
asked
whether
he
had
the
honour
and
felicity
to
address
the
renowned
merchant
ishmaïl
he
bore
an
invitation
from
the
greatest
merchant
in
the
city
whose
name
i
had
already
heard
half
a
dozen
times
in
taftah
and
whom
all
the
merchants
there
revered
from
afar
for
his
enormous
riches
a
certain
yusouff
ben
ahmed
also
called
or
the
triumphant
late
as
was
the
hour
i
purchased
finery
with
my
last
gold
i
hired
a
donkey
of
strange
magnificence
and
arrived
at
the
palace
of
yusouff
dressed
in
a
fashion
which
i
could
ill
afford
but
which
i
regarded
as
an
investment
i
had
expected
to
find
within
this
palace
that
admirable
simplicity
of
manner
which
is
inseparable
from
really
great
wealth
nor
was
i
disappointed
the
inner
room
to
which
i
was
led
encrusted
everywhere
with
black
marble
boasted
no
ornament
save
three
white
alabaster
jars
as
tall
as
a
man
and
of
immense
antiquity
they
had
formerly
been
the
property
of
a
young
noble
whom
yusouff
had
ruined
and
had
them
of
the
sultan
in
the
midst
shone
the
single
pure
flame
of
a
massive
silver
lamp
rifled
from
the
tomb
of
a
saint
it
now
hung
dependent
from
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
the
height
of
which
was
lost
in
the
gloom
of
the
lofty
cupola
a
fountain
of
scented
water
i
could
not
name
its
odour
precisely
but
i
guessed
it
to
be
fior
de
goyim
plashed
gently
into
a
basin
of
porphyry
at
the
end
of
the
apartment
yusouff
and
two
other
guests
who
alone
had
been
asked
to
meet
me
rose
from
the
exceedingly
costly
rugs
of
persia
whereon
they
had
reclined
and
gravely
saluted
me
the
master
of
the
house
after
the
first
salutations
and
an
invocation
upon
my
head
of
the
mercy
of
allah
told
me
that
the
feast
was
ready
prepared
but
that
before
summoning
it
he
would
ask
me
to
honour
the
house
and
survey
what
poor
ornaments
he
might
be
able
to
show
me
i
was
expressly
delighted
at
his
tone
it
was
that
which
i
had
already
heard
to
be
native
to
princes
of
commerce
he
had
already
acquired
in
the
few
years
that
had
elapsed
since
he
had
cleaned
the
streets
for
a
living
a
restraint
of
gesture
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
the
tone
of
one
who
thought
negligible
the
whole
world
including
his
guest
i
prayed
fervently
as
i
accompanied
the
leisurely
steps
of
my
great
entertainer
that
when
i
should
have
achieved
a
similar
fortune
i
should
myself
as
quickly
acquire
this
distinctive
manner
of
the
great
i
watched
him
narrowly
in
order
to
imitate
when
i
should
have
left
his
presence
those
peculiar
little
details
which
mark
affluence
and
are
of
such
service
in
negotiation
he
would
often
interpose
words
of
his
own
into
the
midst
of
another
s
sentence
it
pleased
him
not
to
answer
some
repeated
question
he
would
change
the
conversation
at
his
pleasure
without
too
much
regard
for
what
i
might
have
been
saying
immediately
before
he
also
turned
to
another
guest
while
i
was
addressing
him
and
in
every
way
showed
his
superiority
when
we
had
sat
down
to
meat
i
was
further
edified
by
the
varied
information
the
extensive
culture
of
my
host
he
would
lead
the
talk
on
to
some
subject
which
he
had
recently
acquired
from
his
numerous
secretaries
and
dally
upon
it
at
a
length
which
would
have
been
tedious
in
one
of
lesser
station
but
all
this
was
done
with
such
an
air
of
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
the
slightest
tedium
though
his
minute
description
of
things
which
we
all
knew
by
heart
extended
more
than
once
to
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
during
the
progress
of
this
divine
repast
i
noted
with
pleasure
that
the
distinguished
master
of
the
house
never
once
introduced
the
subject
of
my
affairs
i
would
have
you
remember
my
dear
nephews
said
mahmoud
at
this
point
that
nothing
is
less
pleasing
in
a
merchant
especially
in
one
of
approved
success
than
the
introduction
of
profit
and
loss
at
a
meal
for
profit
and
loss
are
of
such
profound
importance
that
their
mere
mention
must
distract
from
the
legitimate
pleasures
of
the
table
it
was
not
until
a
late
hour
when
the
two
other
guests
whose
insignificant
names
i
have
not
attempted
to
retain
had
arisen
to
depart
that
affairs
began
with
the
subtle
tact
of
commercial
genius
my
host
retained
me
gripping
my
arm
i
ventured
in
the
absence
of
any
witness
to
say
a
few
words
upon
what
was
nearest
my
heart
i
asked
him
were
dates
to
my
delight
he
proved
affable
he
unbent
in
a
degree
unworthy
of
so
small
an
occasion
and
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
to
my
simple
tale
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
had
with
me
at
the
moment
but
few
camels
i
was
under
no
necessity
to
confess
that
i
had
not
another
asset
in
the
world
i
suggested
by
my
negligent
tone
that
such
a
number
could
hardly
be
called
a
caravan
and
was
little
more
than
a
distraction
with
which
i
amused
myself
on
my
travels
i
then
dropped
the
fact
that
i
had
loaded
them
more
as
a
pastime
than
anything
else
with
a
few
at
this
second
mention
of
the
word
the
face
of
suddenly
changed
he
at
first
cast
his
eyes
down
in
an
expression
of
real
concern
then
looking
up
at
me
anxiously
and
steadily
he
said
this
is
no
affair
of
mine
you
may
resent
my
i
assured
him
that
i
desired
nothing
more
than
a
hint
from
one
so
favoured
of
heaven
how
i
had
better
dispose
of
my
trifling
merchandise
i
was
more
anxious
to
hear
his
reply
than
it
is
possible
to
say
he
sighed
heavily
shook
his
head
and
answered
with
a
certain
familiarity
that
i
could
not
resent
my
poor
friend
he
then
sighed
again
and
added
i
really
do
not
see
how
i
can
advise
you
the
truth
is
that
dates
will
from
henceforth
be
almost
unsaleable
here
there
has
lately
taken
place
indeed
it
was
but
last
week
an
extraordinary
thing
the
mother
of
our
emir
the
dowager
has
left
by
will
the
whole
of
her
immense
date
groves
in
trust
to
the
nation
with
orders
that
regular
weekly
distribution
shall
be
made
to
all
the
citizens
we
are
bidden
praise
her
generosity
and
the
masses
are
of
course
delighted
but
it
is
ruin
for
the
poor
merchants
whose
stock
of
dates
are
now
so
much
dross
they
can
not
sell
to
our
neighbours
in
the
country
over
the
border
for
these
hold
dates
to
be
evil
from
their
effect
in
giving
the
toothache
their
new
law
called
the
date
prohibition
act
is
of
the
most
rigorous
kind
i
have
myself
from
a
sense
of
public
duty
bought
up
the
greater
portion
at
a
ruinous
loss
to
prevent
the
failure
of
smaller
men
and
to
avoid
a
panic
i
have
sacrificed
myself
to
the
public
he
sighed
heavily
once
more
and
was
silent
you
may
imagine
my
dear
nephews
the
effect
of
this
news
upon
your
unfortunate
uncle
the
panniers
of
dates
two
for
each
camel
were
save
the
animals
themselves
all
that
i
had
in
the
world
i
had
traversed
the
waste
at
the
cost
of
much
labour
infinite
privation
and
mortal
perils
precisely
because
this
district
had
the
reputation
of
being
by
far
the
best
market
for
dates
and
here
was
i
with
an
enemy
left
behind
me
alone
in
the
world
and
my
sole
venture
ruined
i
remembered
my
dreadful
poverty
only
so
recently
past
and
i
shuddered
as
i
considered
those
unsaleable
dates
and
my
black
future
before
me
was
a
country
where
dates
were
rigorously
forbidden
by
law
behind
me
a
hue
and
cry
despair
was
in
my
heart
though
i
trust
i
have
a
sufficient
degree
of
the
arts
essential
to
our
profession
yusouff
must
have
guessed
my
thoughts
ignoring
my
former
statement
that
the
goods
i
had
with
me
were
but
a
toy
and
that
i
was
indifferent
to
their
fate
he
expressed
the
deepest
sympathy
with
my
plight
and
begged
me
to
bear
with
him
while
he
reflected
within
himself
how
he
might
be
of
service
having
said
this
he
covered
his
face
with
his
right
hand
bowed
his
head
leant
his
elbow
upon
his
knee
and
for
some
moments
was
plunged
in
what
merchants
use
as
thought
when
he
raised
his
face
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
haggard
it
had
become
and
i
marvelled
that
one
so
circumstanced
should
care
so
much
for
the
chance
misfortunes
of
a
stranger
but
i
had
read
that
these
princes
of
commerce
were
often
of
tenderest
heart
and
that
one
should
never
be
surprised
at
any
freak
of
generosity
on
their
part
judge
therefore
of
my
delight
on
hearing
yusouff
say
in
a
determined
voice
that
he
had
concluded
upon
the
only
issue
and
that
he
would
purchase
my
dates
himself
i
can
not
he
frankly
added
give
you
as
good
a
price
even
as
i
could
have
given
a
day
or
two
ago
the
old
queen
s
idea
of
free
dates
has
swamped
everything
but
i
will
pay
a
good
quarter
of
the
customary
price
which
is
far
more
than
you
now
could
obtain
elsewhere
i
am
very
wealthy
you
are
a
stranger
and
as
it
were
our
guest
in
this
town
a
good
deed
is
never
thrown
away
perhaps
some
day
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
aid
also
i
have
seen
you
a
few
hours
only
but
i
think
we
know
each
other
s
hearts
already
moreover
i
do
not
conceal
it
from
you
i
save
much
of
the
loss
i
have
special
correspondents
in
distant
towns
and
opportunities
of
sale
which
others
do
not
possess
come
i
ll
do
it
i
will
offer
you
this
price
of
it
is
but
a
poor
price
said
he
sighing
yet
again
most
heavily
but
it
is
far
far
better
than
no
price
at
my
relief
was
beyond
words
i
had
seen
myself
leaving
my
merchandise
unsold
or
sacrificing
it
at
a
ruinous
nothing
that
which
yusouff
offered
me
was
the
difference
between
despair
and
a
shred
of
hope
and
though
the
loss
was
severe
it
left
me
at
least
with
some
capital
for
a
further
venture
great
men
have
a
sort
of
simplicity
in
their
dealings
hardly
had
yusouff
discovered
my
gratitude
and
my
immediate
acceptance
of
his
gift
for
i
could
call
it
by
no
other
name
than
the
princely
fellow
clapped
his
hands
sent
for
his
treasurer
and
had
counted
to
me
upon
the
spot
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
i
gave
him
my
writing
of
delivery
which
he
handed
to
another
slave
with
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
then
he
continued
to
talk
to
me
for
he
was
determined
to
detain
me
far
into
the
night
indeed
it
was
near
dawn
before
he
whom
i
will
now
call
my
friend
and
to
whom
i
felt
bound
for
life
by
the
greatest
ties
of
grateful
affection
allowed
me
to
pass
his
gates
and
to
return
to
my
hostelry
there
i
found
that
my
panniers
had
already
been
removed
and
their
contents
conveyed
to
the
purchaser
s
warehouse
i
admired
the
promptitude
in
business
which
so
often
accompanies
a
generous
heart
with
the
early
hours
of
the
next
day
before
the
sun
had
yet
acquired
too
great
power
i
strolled
through
the
bazaar
not
so
much
cast
down
at
the
thought
of
my
loss
as
cheered
by
the
recollection
that
i
possessed
after
all
one
hundred
good
pieces
of
solid
gold
with
a
malicious
pleasure
i
approached
the
stall
of
a
putting
down
a
small
copper
coin
i
begged
him
for
a
handful
of
dates
i
need
not
full
measure
said
i
only
a
handful
to
munch
as
i
go
for
i
knew
that
in
the
state
of
the
market
my
penny
might
have
purchased
a
gallon
i
desired
to
show
a
neglect
for
small
sums
to
my
surprise
the
stared
at
me
and
said
dates
from
what
country
do
you
come
that
you
ask
for
in
our
town
why
said
i
is
there
not
a
glut
of
these
i
am
told
the
place
is
overflowing
with
there
is
said
the
resignedly
but
as
for
dates
you
will
not
find
one
in
the
whole
town
our
last
month
s
arrival
was
pillaged
by
robbers
in
the
hills
if
you
will
but
procure
me
a
single
gallon
i
will
readily
give
in
return
two
pieces
of
gold
so
great
is
the
demand
of
supply
there
is
none
whatever
nor
alas
any
prospect
of
i
was
so
bewildered
that
i
hardly
know
what
next
i
said
but
at
any
rate
in
reply
to
it
my
new
acquaintance
told
me
that
there
were
indeed
to
be
certain
dates
in
the
possession
of
who
he
remarked
aside
has
all
the
he
next
said
it
was
also
rumoured
that
yusouff
s
slaves
had
been
seen
in
the
last
hours
of
the
night
going
in
procession
with
a
great
number
of
panniers
laden
on
mules
towards
yusouff
s
warehouse
and
those
who
brought
the
news
swore
that
they
could
smell
the
smell
of
dates
but
beyond
that
smell
he
ended
we
have
had
nothing
of
dates
in
the
place
for
three
weeks
and
if
you
understood
our
habit
in
the
matter
of
food
you
would
feel
for
us
i
have
already
described
to
you
my
dear
nephews
my
admiration
for
long
before
i
had
seen
him
his
distant
reputation
had
inflamed
me
my
brief
acquaintance
with
him
had
exalted
that
feeling
to
what
i
had
thought
the
highest
pitch
but
now
it
passed
all
bounds
a
man
so
subtle
in
negotiations
so
ready
in
affairs
so
rapid
and
conclusive
in
a
bargain
with
so
marvellous
a
command
of
feature
and
of
tone
a
man
in
a
word
so
infinitely
my
superior
in
that
profession
of
commerce
to
which
allah
calls
all
great
souls
and
in
which
i
also
was
engaged
such
a
man
i
had
never
thought
to
meet
nay
i
had
never
thought
such
a
one
to
exist
upon
this
poor
earth
i
could
have
kissed
the
ground
upon
which
he
walked
or
have
borne
upon
me
for
ever
as
a
relic
some
thread
of
his
purse
here
i
exclaimed
is
the
true
merchant
here
is
the
model
of
all
that
a
man
of
affairs
should
be
oh
mahmoud
you
thought
yourself
something
in
your
trade
but
you
have
met
your
master
and
more
than
your
master
you
have
met
one
who
is
to
you
as
the
most
holy
of
saintly
men
is
to
the
basest
of
the
kafir
there
is
on
earth
like
him
allah
has
raised
him
beyond
all
others
but
it
is
not
enough
my
dear
nephews
continued
the
old
man
whose
eyes
were
now
filled
with
a
sort
of
sacred
light
it
is
not
enough
to
admire
those
who
set
us
great
examples
we
should
also
imitate
them
i
determined
after
so
rare
an
experience
to
follow
as
best
i
might
in
the
footsteps
of
one
who
had
shown
himself
raised
high
above
the
level
of
mortality
him
said
i
to
myself
him
will
i
copy
shall
be
my
guide
manner
and
his
tone
on
that
unforgettable
evening
shall
be
my
exact
model
then
perhaps
in
time
i
shall
do
as
he
has
done
and
accumulate
so
great
a
store
of
money
as
shall
put
me
among
the
greatest
of
i
hastened
to
summon
my
slaves
i
paid
my
score
for
the
stabling
and
as
i
looked
at
my
small
capital
and
surveyed
my
beasts
i
hesitated
what
i
should
do
had
by
god
s
special
grace
overshadowing
him
got
hold
of
my
substance
nothing
was
left
me
but
the
camels
in
such
a
strait
i
abandoned
the
thought
of
men
and
turned
at
once
to
heaven
i
lifted
up
my
heart
to
my
maker
and
prayed
for
guidance
he
that
has
never
for
very
long
abandoned
his
servant
answered
my
prayer
with
singular
alacrity
for
even
as
i
prayed
i
heard
two
men
who
passed
me
muttering
one
to
the
other
the
first
as
they
hurried
along
was
saying
in
fearful
undertones
they
have
not
yet
a
camel
among
them
yet
camels
they
must
have
or
the
terrible
sentence
will
be
pronounced
yes
returned
his
companion
in
a
horrified
whisper
i
fear
greatly
for
my
relatives
in
that
town
and
i
am
proceeding
there
to
make
certain
that
they
shall
have
at
least
camel
in
so
terrible
a
time
for
if
a
sufficiency
of
camels
is
not
there
by
noon
i
hear
they
are
all
to
be
impaled
so
speaking
in
subdued
accents
of
terror
little
knowing
they
were
overheard
they
walked
on
while
i
followed
and
noted
every
word
my
mind
was
immediately
made
up
i
continued
with
stealthy
feet
to
follow
these
two
anxious
beings
who
were
so
engrossed
in
the
coming
misfortunes
of
their
native
place
at
last
when
we
had
come
to
an
empty
space
where
three
streets
met
i
caught
them
up
and
faced
them
accosting
them
i
said
sirs
are
you
bound
for
such
and
such
a
place
naming
a
town
of
which
they
could
never
have
heard
for
indeed
it
did
not
exist
they
stopped
and
looked
at
me
in
surprise
no
sir
they
answered
me
together
we
are
bound
in
all
haste
for
our
native
place
which
is
threatened
with
a
great
calamity
its
name
is
mawur
but
alas
it
is
far
distant
from
us
a
matter
of
some
twenty
leagues
the
desert
lies
between
and
we
shall
hardly
reach
it
within
the
day
that
remains
for
we
are
poor
men
and
only
with
fast
at
this
word
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
shuddered
could
the
journey
be
accomplished
in
the
i
thanked
them
politely
regretted
that
i
had
disturbed
them
for
so
little
proceeded
with
the
utmost
haste
to
my
caravan
inquired
the
road
for
mawur
the
track
for
which
lay
plain
through
the
scrub
and
across
the
sand
and
hastened
with
the
utmost
dispatch
all
that
burning
day
and
all
the
succeeding
night
without
repose
until
at
dawn
i
passed
with
my
exhausted
train
through
the
gates
of
the
city
i
had
covered
in
twenty
hours
twice
as
many
leagues
five
of
my
beasts
i
left
upon
the
road
and
some
few
of
my
slaves
how
many
i
had
not
yet
counted
had
fallen
out
and
would
presumably
die
in
the
desert
but
there
was
a
good
remainder
unfortunately
i
was
not
alone
in
my
venture
for
i
discovered
that
early
as
was
the
hour
another
man
had
arrived
already
with
two
camels
and
was
standing
with
them
under
the
dawn
in
the
poor
beasts
they
were
and
bearing
every
mark
of
fatigue
but
i
was
determined
upon
a
monopoly
i
had
hoped
from
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
that
not
a
single
camel
would
be
present
in
the
place
i
would
secure
myself
against
even
the
slightest
competition
i
approached
the
leader
of
the
two
sorry
camels
and
asked
him
there
and
then
what
he
would
take
for
his
cattle
he
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
but
to
my
astonishment
when
i
offered
him
for
a
beginning
the
derisory
price
of
ten
pieces
of
gold
he
accepted
at
once
put
the
coins
into
his
pouch
smiled
evilly
and
moved
off
at
a
great
pace
to
my
chagrin
there
approached
within
a
very
few
moments
yet
another
peasant
leading
this
time
but
one
camel
a
rather
finer
beast
than
the
others
i
hoped
i
believed
he
would
be
the
last
i
made
haste
to
follow
the
same
tactics
with
him
as
with
the
first
like
the
first
he
took
the
five
gold
pieces
without
so
much
as
bargaining
but
he
looked
me
up
and
down
strangely
before
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
taking
himself
off
hastily
down
a
side
lane
and
then
the
people
beginning
to
drift
into
the
street
as
the
day
rose
appeared
a
man
leading
not
less
than
ten
camels
in
a
file
i
was
seriously
alarmed
but
i
bethought
me
of
my
reading
how
all
great
fortunes
had
been
acquired
by
speculation
how
caution
and
other
petty
virtues
were
the
bane
of
true
trade
i
boldly
approached
him
and
offered
him
my
remaining
gold
for
the
whole
bunch
instead
of
meeting
my
offer
with
a
higher
claim
he
asked
to
look
narrowly
at
the
pieces
and
then
looked
as
narrowly
into
my
face
he
took
one
of
the
gold
pieces
and
bit
it
he
stooped
and
rang
it
upon
the
he
determined
apparently
that
it
was
good
and
without
another
word
took
my
gold
appealed
to
those
around
us
as
witnesses
to
the
transaction
handed
me
the
leading
cord
and
with
a
burst
of
laughter
ran
off
at
top
speed
here
then
was
i
with
my
thirteen
new
camels
and
what
was
left
of
my
original
caravan
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
somewhat
disturbed
in
mind
but
i
could
only
trust
in
allah
i
did
so
with
the
utmost
fervour
and
implored
him
to
consider
his
servant
and
to
see
to
it
that
not
another
camel
should
reach
the
town
before
i
began
to
sell
but
what
is
man
what
is
he
that
he
should
order
the
movements
of
the
most
high
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
saw
approaching
down
the
narrowness
of
the
street
a
file
of
certainly
not
less
than
one
hundred
camels
led
by
a
great
company
of
ragged
men
and
walking
with
that
insolent
and
foolish
air
which
this
beast
affects
and
which
at
such
a
moment
provoked
me
to
rage
then
a
slave
trembling
lest
he
should
give
me
offence
bade
me
come
apart
with
him
where
steps
led
up
the
city
wall
these
i
climbed
and
from
the
summit
i
saw
a
sight
that
broke
my
heart
for
there
across
the
plain
that
surrounded
the
city
came
such
a
mass
of
camels
as
i
hardly
thought
the
universe
contained
they
came
in
batches
of
twenty
fifty
two
hundred
herds
and
flocks
of
camels
driven
led
ridden
conducted
in
every
shape
from
one
direction
and
another
through
the
desert
and
cultivated
land
from
track
and
path
a
very
foison
and
cataract
of
camels
it
was
as
though
all
the
camels
of
arabia
india
bactria
and
syria
had
been
summoned
to
this
one
place
and
alas
so
they
had
or
at
least
as
many
as
the
king
of
that
region
could
command
for
this
was
the
explanation
here
the
old
man
s
eyes
grew
dim
with
tears
his
voice
faltered
and
in
spite
of
his
present
riches
he
broke
down
at
the
recollection
of
his
past
oh
my
dear
nephews
he
said
in
broken
accents
hardly
will
you
believe
the
magnitude
of
my
misfortune
for
it
turned
out
as
i
eagerly
questioned
the
people
of
the
place
that
a
war
having
broken
out
against
their
king
on
account
of
the
date
prohibition
of
which
i
have
told
you
that
ruthless
monarch
had
ordered
them
to
collect
as
best
they
might
so
many
thousands
of
camels
to
be
present
within
the
walls
by
noon
of
that
day
or
suffer
massacre
if
the
full
tale
were
not
present
every
man
woman
and
child
would
be
killed
for
he
had
been
suddenly
alarmed
by
this
declaration
of
war
and
caught
with
an
insufficient
provision
of
sumpter
beasts
his
emirs
had
advised
him
that
his
salvation
lay
in
seizing
without
payment
every
beast
for
leagues
around
in
proportion
as
my
soul
sank
so
did
the
hearts
of
the
townsmen
rise
to
see
the
number
gradually
fulfilled
by
noon
all
was
well
for
them
but
very
ill
for
me
the
officers
of
the
king
arrived
the
beasts
were
counted
and
set
apart
with
not
an
ounce
of
copper
to
pay
for
any
one
of
them
all
seized
and
my
poor
herd
alone
and
in
that
vast
multitude
suffered
the
fate
of
all
the
rest
and
what
was
worse
every
one
of
my
slaves
all
were
taken
off
to
serve
as
drivers
there
in
a
far
land
alone
i
stood
with
not
a
gold
piece
left
in
my
pouch
and
not
a
head
of
cattle
to
my
name
once
more
quite
destitute
i
spent
the
remainder
of
that
day
debating
whether
to
hang
myself
on
a
beam
or
throw
myself
from
a
minaret
the
arguments
in
favour
of
either
course
were
so
evenly
balanced
that
the
sun
set
before
i
could
decide
between
them
and
even
at
sunset
there
appeared
through
the
mercy
of
allah
a
new
there
did
said
the
second
of
the
nephews
eagerly
but
before
his
uncle
could
reply
the
intolerable
noise
of
the
muezzin
was
heard
and
the
boys
rising
at
the
signal
bowed
low
to
their
uncle
and
were
gone
الحصان

x
entitled
or
the
horse
when
the
nephews
of
mahmoud
once
again
attended
their
uncle
at
the
hour
of
public
executions
he
gazed
at
them
in
his
benevolent
fashion
again
stroking
his
long
beard
the
better
to
expose
the
jewels
upon
his
fingers
and
continued
the
tale
of
his
fortunes
you
left
me
my
dear
children
at
the
end
of
my
last
recital
in
a
very
deplorable
condition
you
will
remember
that
through
the
superior
business
ability
of
a
merchant
renowned
for
his
organizing
power
grasp
of
detail
sense
of
affairs
i
had
been
reduced
in
property
to
a
few
camels
and
their
attendants
and
that
even
this
poor
remainder
of
my
fortune
i
had
lost
through
a
miscalculation
of
the
camel
market
on
the
eve
of
war
your
filial
affection
will
also
recall
the
bitter
mood
in
which
i
hesitated
whether
to
precipitate
myself
from
a
minaret
or
to
hang
myself
from
a
beam
advantages
and
disadvantages
appeared
equally
balanced
between
these
two
courses
and
though
my
long
training
in
commerce
had
led
me
to
make
rapid
decisions
as
being
the
most
certain
way
of
forestalling
competitors
yet
i
confess
that
in
this
debate
i
stood
uncertain
for
nearly
half
an
hour
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
in
that
was
manifested
in
a
triumphant
manner
the
mercy
of
allah
to
them
that
fear
him
as
i
stood
there
among
strangers
without
one
single
coin
left
in
the
world
and
utterly
devoid
of
credit
with
no
knowledge
even
of
how
i
should
get
food
upon
the
following
day
i
heard
cries
and
a
confusion
of
horses
hoofs
and
saw
galloping
down
the
street
towards
me
a
very
grey
horse
with
flowing
mane
and
a
loose
bridle
it
bore
a
noble
saddle
of
indian
workmanship
but
no
rider
while
some
hundreds
yards
behind
impotently
ran
and
gesticulated
a
corpulent
man
who
from
his
dress
seemed
of
some
wealth
and
consequence
my
first
instinct
was
to
catch
the
runaway
like
any
beggar
and
restore
him
to
his
master
in
hope
of
some
small
reward
a
few
pence
that
might
buy
me
food
that
evening
and
lodging
for
one
night
but
the
beneficent
creator
soon
put
other
thoughts
into
the
mind
of
his
servant
i
had
caught
the
horse
indeed
its
panting
owner
had
slackened
his
pace
and
was
coming
towards
me
in
a
more
dignified
manner
when
it
struck
me
that
the
animal
which
was
restive
could
be
better
controlled
were
i
in
the
saddle
i
am
my
dear
nephews
as
i
have
told
you
three
times
no
horseman
my
more
habitual
steed
is
the
donkey
and
though
i
have
since
my
attainment
to
high
rank
taken
part
in
ceremonial
processions
and
even
in
the
hunting
to
which
his
majesty
so
kindly
invites
me
yet
i
must
confess
to
you
that
whenever
i
have
to
ride
i
take
care
to
be
provided
with
an
animal
not
only
trained
in
the
most
exact
manner
but
also
previously
soothed
with
drugs
i
had
however
taken
to
the
saddle
when
necessity
drove
me
as
you
have
seen
and
on
this
occasion
although
the
beast
was
infinitely
more
mettlesome
than
any
i
had
yet
dared
to
face
i
took
the
risk
courage
was
granted
to
me
from
on
high
i
scrambled
into
the
saddle
but
found
that
my
control
of
the
creature
was
no
better
than
it
had
been
when
i
stood
at
his
head
i
can
not
swear
that
in
the
bewilderment
of
the
moment
i
kept
a
sufficiently
tight
rein
i
will
not
even
swear
that
the
value
of
the
opportunity
was
lost
on
me
i
certainly
remember
delivering
several
violent
kicks
with
either
heel
into
the
ribs
of
the
unquiet
brute
there
followed
a
few
minutes
in
which
under
my
direction
i
must
admit
he
seemed
to
be
galloping
farther
and
farther
away
from
his
original
master
and
at
full
speed
down
the
main
street
of
the
town
i
heard
cries
arising
behind
me
on
every
side
and
upon
attempting
to
look
round
a
difficult
feat
for
one
so
unused
to
the
saddle
i
was
aware
of
a
now
considerable
mob
in
the
midst
of
which
i
saw
the
distant
figure
of
the
horse
s
wealthy
owner
frantically
exclaiming
and
gesticulating
nothing
my
dear
nephews
is
more
foolish
than
to
treat
generously
or
even
rationally
an
excited
crowd
of
human
beings
all
historians
and
philosophers
will
tell
you
that
man
in
this
state
is
but
a
wild
beast
to
be
fled
or
mastered
according
to
our
abilities
as
i
had
not
ability
to
master
them
then
it
was
clearly
my
duty
to
flee
them
moreover
even
as
i
urged
the
horse
to
further
efforts
i
confusedly
appreciated
what
difficulty
i
should
have
in
explaining
my
position
were
i
to
attempt
to
return
we
thundered
through
the
open
gate
into
the
country
outside
and
by
that
time
i
had
no
course
but
frankly
to
take
the
track
across
the
plain
and
shake
off
my
pursuers
for
ever
admire
my
dear
nephews
the
steps
by
which
providence
when
it
desires
to
succour
one
of
its
favourites
will
lead
him
through
one
consequence
after
another
until
at
last
he
stands
secure
in
the
possession
of
some
considerable
sum
of
money
here
was
i
not
ten
minutes
before
contemplating
death
as
the
only
issue
from
my
poverty
and
now
mounted
on
a
fine
steed
seated
in
a
saddle
of
price
and
free
to
try
any
new
adventure
i
kept
my
handsome
mount
at
the
gallop
until
the
gates
were
far
behind
me
and
all
echo
of
the
confused
cries
of
my
pursuers
was
lost
i
checked
him
to
a
sharp
trot
until
we
had
passed
the
first
low
rise
of
rolling
land
which
hid
my
movements
from
the
city
i
then
judged
it
reasonable
to
proceed
at
a
pace
less
trying
to
the
poor
animal
who
had
so
befriended
me
i
noted
from
his
freshness
that
he
could
but
recently
have
left
the
stable
i
did
not
hesitate
though
with
intervals
of
repose
to
continue
all
day
long
to
put
a
greater
and
greater
distance
between
myself
and
that
unfortunate
misunderstanding
which
i
had
left
behind
me
by
evening
my
many
hours
acquaintanceship
with
my
horse
had
increased
my
pride
in
his
possession
and
i
turned
my
mind
away
from
all
morbid
considerations
of
his
former
owner
my
only
anxiety
was
for
the
night
judge
therefore
of
my
satisfaction
when
a
full
hour
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
i
found
myself
on
emerging
from
a
considerable
wood
facing
the
walls
of
a
new
city
the
gates
of
which
stood
about
a
league
away
from
the
spot
whence
i
had
first
caught
sight
of
it
i
lingered
in
this
pleasant
pasture
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
loosening
my
horse
s
girths
unbridling
his
bit
and
letting
him
graze
at
large
on
the
delicious
herbage
i
reclined
myself
for
repose
upon
that
same
grass
and
mused
upon
the
distant
prospect
of
domes
and
minarets
under
the
mellow
light
my
thoughts
naturally
turning
to
conjecture
what
sums
i
might
acquire
in
cash
from
the
citizens
within
those
walls
during
my
enjoyment
of
their
hospitality
the
sun
was
barely
set
when
i
rode
into
the
town
noting
on
the
walls
the
usual
proclamation
against
the
eating
of
dates
and
receiving
as
was
due
to
one
riding
so
and
so
fine
a
horse
the
respectful
looks
of
the
passersby
and
the
humble
but
prolonged
gaze
of
the
guard
at
the
gate
as
i
noted
their
attitude
i
could
not
but
thank
heaven
for
one
more
mercy
which
was
now
revealed
to
me
had
i
happened
to
find
this
horse
after
some
days
of
misfortune
my
own
outward
appearance
would
have
ill
consorted
with
his
how
manifest
was
the
dispensation
of
providence
whereby
i
came
upon
him
within
an
hour
after
losing
my
other
property
and
therefore
while
i
was
still
in
my
decent
merchant
s
dress
cleanly
and
groomed
there
was
in
the
central
square
of
this
town
a
runnel
specially
disposed
for
watering
beasts
of
burden
and
my
horse
we
had
forded
but
one
stream
in
all
that
day
s
journey
eagerly
approached
it
i
fondly
patted
his
neck
and
thought
with
pleasure
of
how
noble
a
friend
i
had
acquired
for
as
you
must
have
read
there
is
a
sort
of
affinity
between
man
and
the
horse
which
readily
makes
them
intimate
after
even
a
short
acquaintance
especially
if
the
man
be
of
a
business
turn
of
mind
and
the
horse
of
considerable
value
from
this
mood
into
which
i
had
fallen
while
my
handsome
mount
was
taking
his
simple
refreshment
you
may
guess
the
perturbation
caused
me
when
i
heard
at
my
side
an
eager
voice
deliberately
pitched
in
a
low
key
so
that
it
might
be
heard
by
none
but
myself
that
voice
was
full
of
passionate
necessity
and
was
asking
me
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
dispose
of
my
mount
to
a
man
whose
life
depended
on
it
i
turned
and
made
out
in
the
dusk
under
the
shadow
of
his
cowl
part
of
which
he
had
pulled
over
his
features
to
make
a
sort
of
veil
a
young
man
whose
agitation
made
me
yearn
instinctively
to
take
some
advantage
of
him
sir
he
whispered
hurriedly
my
request
is
not
only
impertinent
but
extraordinary
i
know
that
you
will
not
understand
it
i
can
only
implore
heaven
for
a
miracle
my
time
is
very
short
i
know
not
how
far
my
pursuers
may
be
my
life
is
dear
to
me
and
still
dearer
is
my
honour
the
night
is
falling
here
is
my
opportunity
which
if
i
do
not
take
all
is
over
with
he
thereupon
passed
up
to
me
a
leather
bag
upon
opening
which
i
could
see
in
the
fading
light
a
quantity
of
gold
pieces
and
he
accompanied
the
gesture
with
so
imploring
a
look
as
explained
the
vastness
of
his
offer
had
i
passed
through
any
series
of
adventures
less
astonishing
than
those
of
the
last
day
and
night
i
would
not
have
listened
for
a
moment
to
a
first
proposal
i
would
have
attempted
as
was
indeed
my
duty
to
raise
his
price
to
obtain
immediately
some
of
his
apparel
as
well
as
his
purse
and
if
possible
a
written
promise
of
further
payment
as
well
for
he
was
distraught
with
fear
and
men
in
that
condition
are
easily
squeezed
but
the
rate
at
which
i
had
been
living
the
perpetual
succession
first
of
unfortunate
and
then
of
fortunate
accidents
showed
the
manifest
finger
of
god
in
all
that
had
so
far
favoured
me
since
the
morning
and
strangely
convinced
me
without
another
word
i
took
the
bag
of
gold
and
dismounted
the
young
man
with
a
new
expression
such
as
i
had
never
yet
seen
upon
anyone
s
face
said
not
a
word
no
not
even
of
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
turned
the
horse
s
head
down
the
main
street
of
the
town
wisely
refraining
from
too
rapid
an
exit
lest
his
passage
should
be
remembered
and
went
at
no
more
than
a
sharp
trot
through
the
gate
into
the
falling
darkness
without
the
last
i
saw
of
him
he
appeared
a
dark
figure
rapidly
dwindling
against
the
darkening
sky
framed
in
the
tiled
horseshoe
of
the
but
even
as
i
gazed
a
troop
of
mounted
horsemen
thundered
past
me
and
passed
through
that
same
gate
into
the
night
for
my
part
i
thought
no
more
of
him
but
turned
back
to
the
centre
of
the
town
there
i
was
with
three
times
the
price
of
my
horse
in
my
pocket
and
thus
with
solid
ground
on
which
to
stand
for
the
future
my
first
care
was
to
make
an
excellent
meal
my
next
to
discover
a
good
lodging
for
the
night
in
both
i
was
fortunate
but
before
reciting
my
last
evening
prayers
i
took
the
precaution
of
informing
a
passing
patrol
that
i
had
had
a
horse
stolen
from
me
for
in
business
no
opportunity
should
be
neglected
i
then
recommended
myself
to
the
divine
protection
and
fell
into
a
sweet
repose
next
morning
after
i
had
humbly
and
devoutly
recited
my
early
prayers
i
thought
i
would
before
proceeding
to
any
lucrative
task
divert
myself
a
little
so
that
i
might
later
approach
serious
business
with
a
more
open
mind
it
is
my
custom
when
i
am
in
need
of
recreation
from
the
cares
of
commerce
to
frequent
the
criminal
courts
and
to
attend
the
sentences
passed
upon
those
brought
before
them
as
well
as
to
be
a
spectator
of
the
ensuing
executions
no
pastime
affords
greater
relief
from
the
dull
everyday
round
of
buying
and
selling
while
the
contrast
between
one
s
own
pleasant
position
and
that
of
the
pauper
who
is
to
be
beheaded
adds
a
zest
which
i
recommend
to
all
men
of
affairs
i
strolled
therefore
to
the
court
in
which
i
had
heard
that
certain
criminals
were
to
be
that
morning
briefly
examined
and
presumably
dispatched
great
was
my
surprise
upon
entering
to
find
that
i
had
come
just
in
time
to
hear
the
last
evidence
given
and
sentence
pronounced
upon
the
same
young
man
who
had
so
imprudently
bought
my
horse
the
night
before
did
i
say
imprudently
well
the
designs
of
providence
are
hidden
from
us
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
another
while
i
pitied
him
therefore
i
had
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
for
i
had
fulfilled
in
the
most
honourable
fashion
the
only
contract
with
which
i
was
concerned
in
the
matter
the
pursuers
had
arrested
him
before
he
had
left
the
city
more
than
a
mile
he
stood
accused
of
eating
dates
a
practice
you
will
remember
forbidden
throughout
all
those
dominions
he
had
been
seen
in
the
act
by
the
sultan
s
officers
a
week
before
and
his
name
and
description
had
been
sent
round
to
every
city
indeed
a
troop
was
hot
upon
his
trail
at
the
moment
he
had
come
up
the
night
before
imploring
for
my
mount
sentence
was
pronounced
and
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
led
out
to
execution
my
natural
love
of
such
sights
would
have
led
me
to
follow
him
when
one
more
act
of
heaven
i
dare
not
ascribe
the
inspiration
to
my
poor
unaided
soul
suddenly
put
an
exceedingly
valuable
thought
into
my
mind
i
addressed
the
judge
in
a
loud
voice
complaining
in
the
matter
of
my
horse
at
first
he
was
disturbed
and
inclined
to
silence
me
not
understanding
what
plea
i
could
have
in
this
particular
case
but
i
made
bold
to
arrest
his
attention
and
told
him
that
the
evidence
i
had
chanced
to
hear
proved
clearly
that
the
horse
on
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
tried
to
escape
was
one
stolen
from
me
but
a
few
hours
before
this
i
was
prepared
to
prove
the
officers
of
the
court
were
examined
and
admitted
my
description
to
be
exact
as
to
the
horse
and
what
was
a
clinching
piece
of
evidence
as
to
the
details
of
the
saddle
the
workmanship
of
which
they
had
noted
i
informed
the
judge
further
that
i
had
ridden
into
the
town
the
evening
before
i
was
prepared
to
bring
witnesses
from
the
guard
at
the
gate
who
had
seen
me
pass
and
when
these
were
summoned
they
agreed
that
i
had
entered
riding
a
horse
of
the
description
i
had
just
given
i
could
see
that
the
judge
inclined
to
the
justice
of
my
plea
the
officers
of
the
court
naturally
fell
in
with
his
mood
i
made
him
i
think
the
more
gracious
by
my
assurance
that
i
would
not
dream
of
making
too
exact
a
claim
if
the
animal
were
but
restored
to
me
i
should
be
satisfied
nor
would
i
ask
anything
for
dilapidation
or
loss
of
time
i
was
only
too
glad
i
said
to
have
been
of
the
most
insignificant
service
to
the
court
the
judge
now
smiled
upon
me
with
evident
approval
and
was
further
confirmed
in
his
decision
by
remembering
that
even
if
i
claimed
any
compensation
it
would
not
come
out
of
his
pocket
but
the
public
s
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
argument
though
not
explicitly
put
forward
was
present
in
the
minds
of
all
the
officers
of
the
court
as
well
the
judge
therefore
ordered
that
the
animal
should
be
restored
to
me
and
was
pleased
to
use
the
following
words
they
are
not
my
own
i
am
not
responsible
for
them
but
i
am
glad
that
he
used
them
this
honest
merchant
said
he
who
has
given
a
very
clear
account
of
his
movements
we
are
in
some
fashion
beholden
to
on
account
of
the
temporary
loss
which
he
has
suffered
in
the
filching
of
his
mount
by
the
criminal
with
whom
we
have
just
dealt
he
was
indirectly
the
cause
of
that
criminal
s
arrest
the
least
we
can
do
therefore
is
to
give
him
his
property
back
with
the
least
possible
delay
i
order
that
the
animal
with
all
his
accoutrements
having
first
been
properly
fed
and
groomed
shall
be
restored
to
i
very
humbly
bowed
and
thanked
the
court
for
its
just
decision
but
a
new
complication
arose
the
chief
officer
of
the
court
the
captain
of
those
who
had
arrested
the
young
man
he
had
by
this
time
lost
his
head
so
that
there
was
no
trouble
to
be
feared
from
side
conferred
with
his
colleagues
and
then
prostrated
himself
upon
the
earth
before
the
judge
begging
to
be
allowed
an
explanation
the
judge
assumed
a
disturbed
expression
and
bade
him
be
brief
he
arose
and
admitted
with
evident
grief
that
the
horse
in
the
excitement
of
the
arrest
and
in
the
darkness
of
the
moment
for
all
this
had
passed
in
the
night
had
got
loose
and
was
lost
seeing
the
rising
anger
of
the
judge
i
hastily
intervened
i
said
that
i
yielded
to
no
one
in
my
admiration
for
the
mounted
police
of
the
force
the
renown
of
whose
efficiency
had
reached
me
even
in
my
own
distant
land
i
said
that
i
would
be
the
last
to
cause
the
least
injustice
or
even
pain
i
begged
that
his
importance
for
such
was
the
simple
title
of
a
judge
in
that
country
would
overlook
the
unfortunate
accident
whereby
my
horse
had
been
lost
i
concluded
by
saying
that
i
would
be
perfectly
content
with
what
we
merchants
called
a
minimum
valuation
that
is
a
payment
of
the
price
the
horse
would
have
fetched
from
what
we
merchants
also
call
a
willing
in
a
phrase
of
which
i
confess
i
was
secretly
proud
i
hinted
that
the
doing
of
justice
in
this
matter
would
not
only
be
of
no
charge
to
the
court
but
even
of
some
profit
to
them
seeing
that
there
were
certain
to
be
fees
of
transfer
registration
and
what
not
as
a
layman
i
was
ignorant
of
their
amount
but
i
knew
them
to
be
attached
to
such
affairs
all
out
of
the
taxes
the
judge
the
officers
of
the
court
and
every
lawyer
present
the
very
sweepers
were
moved
to
action
sundry
papers
were
signed
to
which
i
put
the
name
of
ali
it
was
the
first
that
occurred
to
me
i
was
paid
the
sum
of
thirty
pieces
of
gold
and
after
profound
obeisances
to
all
present
and
especially
to
my
benefactor
the
judge
i
left
the
court
yet
richer
than
i
had
entered
it
my
children
what
next
it
is
a
universal
rule
in
commerce
to
follow
your
profits
and
cut
your
losses
and
men
of
my
profession
have
a
sort
of
instinct
which
tells
them
how
long
the
tide
will
be
flowing
with
them
and
when
it
will
turn
i
decided
that
there
was
yet
one
more
step
for
me
to
take
the
arrest
had
taken
place
not
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
whence
i
had
first
perceived
the
city
there
my
horse
the
evening
before
had
found
good
pasture
there
had
i
loosened
his
saddle
there
had
he
known
an
excellent
place
of
repose
thither
did
i
wisely
suppose
my
lost
friend
to
have
repaired
i
sauntered
therefore
out
of
the
city
as
though
engaged
upon
no
more
than
a
stroll
and
sure
enough
a
league
away
under
the
trees
which
afforded
a
grateful
shade
the
noble
beast
was
reclining
hampered
only
by
his
saddle
i
loosened
the
girths
he
was
grateful
and
our
friendship
was
renewed
but
though
my
affection
was
increased
by
such
a
recovery
i
steeled
my
heart
for
what
i
purposed
next
to
do
it
is
a
maxim
of
all
sound
business
that
a
thing
should
be
sold
as
often
as
possible
and
it
was
clear
that
i
now
had
an
opportunity
of
selling
this
charming
creature
for
the
third
time
it
was
equally
clear
that
if
i
delayed
the
opportunity
would
pass
for
the
story
of
my
appearance
in
court
would
spread
through
the
city
the
officers
would
talk
with
their
friends
about
the
saddle
and
the
description
of
the
animal
i
might
even
get
into
a
difficult
tangle
with
the
authorities
but
the
whole
of
this
propitious
day
was
in
the
hand
of
heaven
for
while
yet
the
sun
was
high
there
came
upon
me
through
the
pasture
a
shepherd
driving
his
sheep
and
to
him
i
told
a
tale
that
i
had
been
sent
by
my
master
to
sell
the
horse
i
was
leading
and
his
saddle
to
a
certain
dealer
who
had
already
seen
them
and
bargained
for
them
i
had
been
given
a
writing
with
the
name
of
the
dealer
in
the
neighbouring
city
but
i
had
lost
the
writing
and
could
not
remember
the
name
or
direction
the
shepherd
told
me
that
he
only
went
to
that
city
from
time
to
time
but
he
was
well
acquainted
with
it
the
purchaser
could
be
none
other
than
the
moment
he
pronounced
this
name
i
clapped
my
hands
together
and
said
that
was
the
name
i
thanked
the
shepherd
for
thus
refreshing
my
memory
and
i
carefully
walked
by
the
beast
s
side
as
should
a
mere
servant
by
his
master
s
precious
possession
i
avoided
the
main
gate
which
i
had
now
passed
twice
and
where
i
might
be
too
well
known
and
entered
the
city
by
a
little
postern
i
found
from
inquiry
of
a
blind
man
which
was
the
more
prudent
the
way
to
s
stables
i
made
no
plan
of
what
i
should
do
for
on
those
days
when
i
am
specially
favoured
by
the
most
high
i
leave
his
power
to
guide
me
and
to
guide
also
those
with
whom
i
do
business
i
went
no
farther
than
to
tell
the
groom
that
i
had
come
to
find
a
purchaser
for
the
horse
not
indeed
in
this
city
where
i
had
been
told
the
market
was
poor
but
in
a
place
two
days
journey
away
where
the
news
of
the
famous
beast
s
coming
had
already
been
spread
i
then
wandered
out
into
the
streets
to
take
the
cool
air
of
the
evening
it
was
as
i
had
expected
when
i
returned
to
see
that
my
horse
had
been
well
fed
was
present
in
the
stable
and
eager
to
deal
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
advantages
he
enjoyed
for
disposing
of
horses
the
dangers
of
the
distant
journey
of
which
i
had
spoken
to
the
groom
the
possibility
of
what
is
called
in
the
language
of
that
country
a
he
showed
me
what
in
my
innocence
i
might
have
forgotten
that
it
was
not
as
though
the
horse
was
my
own
that
could
only
be
a
gainer
that
my
master
would
be
none
the
wiser
that
i
might
pretend
any
accident
to
have
taken
place
for
indeed
such
an
accident
was
likely
if
i
went
on
farther
he
also
was
at
the
pains
of
repeating
what
i
might
have
forgotten
that
i
was
free
to
retain
for
myself
some
portion
of
the
price
assuring
me
that
he
would
keep
silent
upon
the
matter
in
the
end
i
promised
to
hand
him
over
the
horse
for
sixty
pieces
of
gold
there
are
some
men
my
dear
nephews
who
even
in
these
circumstances
would
have
begun
bargaining
for
a
higher
price
these
are
men
who
love
the
making
of
small
sums
and
who
do
not
understand
the
enormous
weight
of
caprice
and
chance
in
human
affairs
so
far
from
attempting
to
get
a
higher
price
i
expressed
my
gratitude
and
said
that
for
my
part
i
was
quite
willing
to
take
less
but
that
i
somewhat
feared
my
master
s
anger
and
could
not
return
to
him
without
at
least
fifty
pieces
of
gold
adding
that
i
considered
ten
pieces
a
sufficient
reward
for
myself
at
the
same
time
i
advised
abdul
not
to
sell
the
saddle
the
horse
nor
did
i
omit
to
remind
him
that
horses
of
a
light
colour
are
more
easily
dyed
than
those
of
a
darker
hue
at
these
suggestions
of
mine
he
looked
upon
me
mournfully
for
a
few
moments
and
then
slowly
counted
out
sixty
pieces
of
gold
i
took
a
long
farewell
of
the
kindly
patient
and
beautiful
animal
which
had
borne
me
to
this
fortune
in
the
short
space
of
one
day
and
then
walked
forth
through
the
city
into
the
evening
preferring
the
chance
of
a
lodging
in
the
forest
to
tempting
further
the
singular
fate
that
had
so
far
befriended
me
the
weather
was
warm
the
neighbouring
wood
as
i
knew
by
experience
hospitable
there
would
i
spend
the
few
hours
of
darkness
building
myself
a
small
fire
to
keep
off
the
beasts
and
to
cherish
me
thence
i
did
not
doubt
i
could
the
next
morning
with
now
so
satisfactory
a
capital
proceed
to
the
of
my
fortune
i
reached
the
wooded
hill
which
overlooked
the
city
i
recited
my
third
night
prayers
before
building
my
fire
and
disposing
myself
to
sleep
i
looked
at
the
outline
of
the
walls
and
domes
and
graceful
minarets
against
the
last
of
the
evening
and
i
revolved
in
my
mind
that
thought
which
shall
ever
be
mine
on
my
departure
from
any
town
let
it
also
be
yours
my
dear
children
in
all
your
travels
for
just
as
when
you
come
to
a
new
city
of
a
morning
before
you
enter
it
and
after
having
prayed
god
you
should
muse
within
yourself
what
sums
of
money
you
may
hope
to
lift
from
its
inhabitants
so
when
you
leave
any
city
at
evening
never
omit
after
due
thanks
to
your
creator
to
calculate
what
sums
you
have
indeed
subtracted
from
those
to
whom
you
bid
as
the
old
merchant
ceased
it
was
like
the
ending
of
a
strain
of
solemn
music
the
echoes
of
which
linger
and
continue
in
the
memory
the
strangely
moving
words
he
had
uttered
stirred
a
profound
in
the
depths
of
their
young
souls
and
they
sat
with
bowed
heads
until
the
horrid
outrage
of
the
muezzin
s
call
murdered
that
sacred
silence
at
the
signal
the
lads
rose
and
filed
out
on
tiptoe
leaving
their
uncle
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
lips
murmuring
in
prayer
that
is
the
holy
one
chapter
xi
entitled
or
the
holy
one
when
the
hour
of
public
executions
had
arrived
they
were
more
numerous
than
usual
his
young
nephews
respectfully
assembled
at
the
feet
of
the
aged
millionaire
and
received
the
further
account
of
his
fortunes
you
might
imagine
my
children
he
began
that
having
this
small
capital
so
happily
furnished
me
by
providence
in
the
short
space
of
a
single
day
i
would
again
venture
upon
a
commercial
undertaking
that
would
have
been
indeed
my
natural
course
but
you
must
remember
that
i
could
not
without
great
danger
enter
the
city
i
had
just
left
lest
my
able
transactions
should
lead
me
into
contact
with
those
at
whose
expense
they
had
been
conducted
further
i
was
in
a
strange
country
with
no
knowledge
of
my
way
and
with
nothing
to
guide
me
save
the
happy
circumstance
that
i
was
still
within
the
boundaries
of
our
holy
religion
most
of
those
i
should
meet
would
thus
be
true
believers
whose
frailties
i
could
better
understand
than
those
of
the
kafir
and
of
whom
therefore
i
could
under
the
guidance
of
heaven
more
easily
take
advantage
devoutly
remembering
the
signal
mercies
shown
to
me
by
allah
in
this
last
short
day
i
determined
to
follow
the
same
course
as
i
had
when
my
good
fortune
came
to
me
to
lie
passive
under
the
mighty
hand
directing
me
and
to
trust
to
luck
i
took
some
sleep
in
the
night
beside
my
fire
but
hardly
had
i
awakened
at
dawn
when
i
was
aware
of
a
group
approaching
me
through
the
forest
track
they
were
a
party
of
a
dozen
or
so
half
of
them
on
foot
half
of
them
mounted
of
no
great
consequence
if
one
might
judge
by
their
clothing
which
my
dear
nephews
is
in
most
occasions
in
life
the
signal
by
which
we
may
know
whether
to
revere
men
or
to
despise
them
both
beasts
and
humans
in
this
group
were
as
having
come
from
some
great
distance
as
i
saw
them
before
they
saw
me
i
naturally
took
the
precaution
of
creeping
up
behind
them
through
the
trees
in
order
to
overhear
the
object
of
their
journey
it
appeared
that
they
were
bound
on
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
a
most
holy
man
to
obtain
his
oracle
in
a
matter
which
concerned
their
miserable
village
my
mind
was
at
once
made
up
i
ran
back
by
a
circuitous
course
through
the
trees
came
to
a
place
ahead
of
their
progress
and
there
spreading
my
little
mat
upon
the
sward
i
prostrated
myself
in
prayer
indeed
i
was
thus
able
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
for
i
had
not
yet
said
those
morning
prayers
of
the
true
believer
which
i
had
never
omitted
in
all
my
life
save
when
i
happened
to
be
flying
from
justice
and
therefore
deprived
of
leisure
as
i
heard
them
coming
up
behind
me
i
raised
my
head
and
voice
at
once
and
fell
into
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
worship
which
did
not
fail
to
impress
the
simple
mountaineers
they
halted
respectfully
until
i
saw
fit
to
terminate
my
conversation
with
the
most
high
i
pretended
to
be
so
absorbed
in
my
contemplation
of
divine
things
as
not
to
notice
them
for
to
keep
them
waiting
secured
religious
as
well
as
worldly
respect
they
approached
me
with
deference
and
even
awe
i
told
them
i
was
bound
for
the
shrine
of
a
most
holy
man
whose
name
i
gave
them
they
were
overjoyed
to
discover
that
they
had
a
companion
filled
with
the
same
sentiments
as
themselves
we
also
said
their
leader
are
engaged
upon
the
same
sacred
mission
for
we
have
been
informed
by
a
messenger
whom
we
dispatched
a
month
ago
from
our
village
that
the
saint
will
graciously
receive
us
and
give
us
a
reply
upon
a
doubtful
matter
of
wild
which
has
greatly
excited
our
tribe
whether
they
be
pork
or
i
let
them
convey
by
chance
phrases
the
direction
we
had
to
travel
and
the
distance
of
our
goal
i
was
delighted
to
discover
that
our
way
did
not
lie
through
the
city
and
that
we
might
hope
to
reach
the
holy
one
before
night
the
journey
was
tedious
passing
over
burnt
land
with
but
a
few
wretched
villages
upon
the
track
but
by
the
late
afternoon
we
could
see
far
off
coloured
by
the
declining
rays
of
the
sun
a
small
building
the
tomb
of
a
great
saint
long
dead
by
the
side
of
which
a
large
group
of
tents
and
a
considerable
assembly
lying
out
in
the
open
round
them
cooking
their
evening
meal
beasts
of
burden
and
all
the
movement
of
a
camp
showed
us
that
we
were
reaching
the
term
of
our
day
s
journey
when
we
reached
the
camp
i
joined
the
thickest
part
of
the
throng
separating
from
the
group
with
which
i
had
been
marching
i
made
my
evening
prayers
in
as
conspicuous
a
place
as
possible
prolonged
them
prodigiously
the
better
to
impress
my
new
neighbours
and
then
lay
down
uncertain
what
the
course
of
the
next
day
should
be
it
was
revealed
to
me
in
a
dream
in
that
dream
there
appeared
a
bright
and
beneficent
being
who
with
one
hand
was
relieving
of
his
superfluous
wealth
an
unconscious
pilgrim
to
his
left
and
with
the
other
was
conferring
precisely
the
same
favour
on
another
to
his
right
each
of
the
two
pilgrims
had
his
face
turned
away
from
the
blessed
genius
thus
engaged
and
seemed
unconscious
of
the
process
to
which
he
was
subjected
the
glorious
visitant
without
interrupting
its
occupation
or
ceasing
with
mechanical
regularity
to
dip
its
hands
into
the
pouches
of
its
unwitting
neighbours
looked
upon
me
with
the
most
benign
expression
winked
and
disappeared
i
awoke
it
was
yet
dark
i
pondered
until
dawn
what
the
revelation
might
mean
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
inner
as
well
as
outer
light
was
bestowed
upon
me
i
interpreted
in
the
following
fashion
the
vision
that
had
thus
been
vouchsafed
to
me
and
the
event
proved
me
to
have
divined
the
right
reading
by
interpretation
in
every
place
largely
frequented
by
pilgrims
you
will
my
dear
nephews
if
your
commercial
pursuits
lead
you
to
such
spots
in
after
life
discover
two
kinds
of
men
there
are
those
who
have
already
spent
their
all
under
the
influence
of
the
spirit
and
are
about
to
depart
these
being
in
a
necessity
to
raise
a
viaticum
for
their
return
will
eagerly
convert
into
cash
at
a
vile
price
such
wretched
objects
as
remain
to
them
on
the
other
hand
those
arriving
are
flush
of
money
and
eager
to
acquire
holy
relics
and
memorials
of
the
blessed
days
before
them
with
two
such
markets
before
one
s
eyes
and
clamouring
for
exploitation
all
that
is
required
is
a
little
judgment
upon
which
is
which
who
is
who
and
what
is
what
such
a
judgment
is
essential
to
any
commercial
success
but
especially
to
success
with
people
in
a
state
of
religious
exaltation
for
whereas
this
mood
often
conduces
to
folly
it
sometimes
so
supernaturally
brightens
the
intellectual
faculties
of
devotees
as
to
procure
most
cruel
rebuffs
for
him
who
attempts
to
take
advantage
of
it
i
mixed
with
my
i
picked
out
those
whom
i
judged
from
their
anxious
expression
coupled
with
their
preparations
for
a
journey
to
be
eager
sellers
from
these
i
acquired
at
prices
quite
surprisingly
small
all
manner
of
objects
sticks
chaplets
sandals
rags
and
cords
while
i
dexterously
sheered
off
the
few
who
seemed
too
much
inclined
to
bargain
and
whom
not
even
a
prolonged
residence
at
the
shrine
had
wholly
purged
of
avarice
the
remainder
were
quite
sufficient
for
my
needs
with
a
stock
thus
acquired
at
the
expenditure
of
not
a
tenth
of
my
capital
i
next
proceeded
to
mix
with
the
more
prosperous
newcomers
pressing
on
them
now
one
object
and
now
another
sandals
lace
rags
bits
of
bone
and
leather
as
somethings
of
peculiar
sanctity
either
as
dedicated
to
the
shrine
of
the
dead
holy
man
or
as
having
touched
the
person
of
the
living
one
i
discovered
a
very
brisk
market
indeed
at
prices
varying
from
a
hundred
to
a
thousand
times
the
original
cost
of
the
rubbish
to
each
bit
of
rag
bone
or
what
not
i
was
careful
to
affix
a
pedigree
written
in
various
hands
and
proving
it
authentic
in
these
negotiations
i
was
careful
at
the
least
note
of
suspicion
to
pretend
a
complete
indifference
and
to
one
or
two
more
than
usually
guileful
i
even
made
the
sacrifice
of
giving
a
yard
of
used
cord
or
a
hopelessly
worn
sandal
remarking
as
i
did
so
that
sacred
things
should
not
be
made
a
matter
of
traffic
in
this
fashion
i
passed
four
days
so
absorbed
in
the
interest
of
the
occupation
that
i
quite
forgot
it
was
an
error
on
my
part
to
present
myself
within
the
clamouring
line
of
those
who
daily
demanded
the
opportunity
to
fall
down
before
the
object
of
our
pilgrimage
and
to
offer
him
obeisance
it
was
a
mistake
which
nearly
cost
me
dear
for
the
holy
man
had
his
hired
watchers
among
the
crowd
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
as
i
was
privately
counting
my
gains
under
a
secluded
bush
where
i
hoped
to
be
unobserved
i
was
disturbed
by
a
smart
tap
upon
the
shoulder
and
a
summons
from
an
aged
but
tall
and
still
strong
man
armed
with
a
formidable
bludgeon
this
person
bade
me
follow
him
without
comment
and
told
me
i
had
been
granted
the
singular
favour
of
personal
access
to
the
master
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
that
i
accompanied
my
guide
we
elbowed
our
way
through
the
foremost
ranks
of
worshippers
to
that
inmost
place
wherein
the
holy
one
communed
with
his
creator
they
envied
me
and
gazed
with
awe
upon
one
so
privileged
but
for
my
part
my
heart
sank
lower
and
lower
and
i
waited
in
something
approaching
panic
the
interview
that
had
been
so
graciously
afforded
i
was
introduced
through
a
curtain
into
a
low
hut
wholly
devoid
of
ornament
built
of
dried
mud
and
lit
only
by
two
small
smoky
lamps
that
stood
upon
the
floor
i
dimly
perceived
before
me
in
this
the
figure
of
a
very
aged
man
incredibly
emaciated
with
prolonged
fast
and
vigil
he
was
upon
his
knees
with
a
chaplet
in
his
hands
his
eyes
were
cast
upon
the
ground
which
his
long
but
sparse
white
beard
almost
touched
he
seemed
oblivious
to
all
the
external
world
and
was
plunged
in
profound
communion
with
his
maker
the
attendant
in
low
but
angry
whispers
bade
me
prostrate
myself
which
i
was
not
slow
in
doing
and
in
that
posture
i
waited
for
a
space
of
time
so
tedious
that
it
seemed
to
me
the
greater
part
of
one
hour
but
during
all
that
time
i
dared
not
move
for
though
i
had
never
visited
this
particular
shrine
i
had
heard
tales
of
what
had
happened
to
those
who
underrate
the
unseen
powers
i
was
relieved
at
last
by
a
distinct
and
hollow
voice
bidding
me
in
measured
tones
to
rise
i
arose
and
found
that
we
were
alone
the
attendants
had
been
dismissed
by
a
gesture
while
my
face
was
yet
buried
on
the
ground
and
though
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
were
within
earshot
i
suffered
the
added
awe
of
loneliness
the
holy
one
still
maintained
for
a
moment
his
impassive
attitude
of
prayer
then
slowly
pivoted
round
on
his
knees
turned
his
luminous
eyes
upon
me
and
sternly
asked
me
what
profit
i
had
made
by
my
infamous
trade
during
the
last
few
days
i
felt
that
all
was
known
to
him
i
did
not
i
thank
heaven
for
its
mercies
attempt
to
deceive
him
and
thus
jeopardize
my
life
and
reason
i
told
him
the
full
tale
and
awaited
his
sentence
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
what
little
was
left
of
my
courage
ebbed
away
i
felt
prepared
to
hear
some
short
sentence
of
doom
and
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
but
i
had
happily
miscalculated
the
serene
wisdom
which
accompanies
holiness
the
saint
spoke
next
in
a
more
benevolent
and
softer
voice
bade
me
be
seated
before
him
and
adopting
the
same
attitude
pronounced
the
following
remarkable
words
the
just
the
merciful
whose
name
be
exalted
has
given
to
different
men
different
aptitudes
the
fool
attempts
that
of
which
he
is
incapable
the
wise
man
recognizes
his
in
the
silence
that
followed
i
turned
these
weighty
phrases
over
in
my
mind
and
recognized
excerpts
from
the
proverbs
of
whose
wisdom
has
been
collected
by
the
persians
and
has
been
famous
since
the
times
of
the
second
omar
after
a
short
interval
the
voice
continued
in
mutual
appreciation
and
in
mutual
benefits
each
acquires
profit
the
forfeit
advantage
by
too
much
these
words
which
were
chanted
rather
than
said
i
recognized
to
be
from
a
totally
different
collection
of
popular
sayings
formerly
current
in
arabia
and
reduced
to
writing
in
the
first
century
of
hegira
by
the
learned
of
rasht
it
was
clear
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
man
unusually
and
my
conviction
was
confirmed
when
after
yet
another
solemn
pause
the
voice
continued
as
though
in
conclusion
in
acquiring
money
there
is
profit
but
in
letting
it
slip
there
is
none
at
this
last
jewel
of
wisdom
i
immediately
recalled
as
part
of
yet
another
collection
to
wit
the
sacred
books
of
the
jews
and
from
this
further
example
of
immense
erudition
my
estimation
of
the
being
possessed
of
it
arose
to
the
clouds
after
such
a
preface
i
might
have
expected
further
general
statements
of
a
moral
nature
from
my
host
when
suddenly
i
perceived
a
total
change
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
a
similar
change
in
his
attitude
he
put
off
the
preoccupation
of
religion
he
took
on
the
tone
of
familiar
intercourse
proper
to
temporal
affairs
he
smiled
genially
and
entered
upon
a
conversation
such
as
one
might
enjoy
in
the
bazaar
of
any
city
or
in
the
private
hospitality
of
any
merchant
there
are
some
he
said
who
would
have
blamed
your
conduct
and
in
a
sense
i
do
so
for
i
can
not
excuse
your
passage
of
four
whole
days
without
a
thought
of
heaven
but
then
we
are
all
agreed
that
the
driving
of
a
trade
especially
if
it
be
remarkably
rapid
and
lucrative
is
a
very
worthy
occupation
and
it
is
one
of
my
regrets
that
my
professional
devotion
to
the
other
world
has
curtailed
my
own
activities
in
the
same
line
i
am
visited
by
thousands
of
respectful
worshippers
the
small
amounts
of
alms
which
they
graciously
leave
with
my
treasurer
might
easily
be
increased
by
various
commercial
activities
indeed
i
have
from
time
to
time
attempted
to
establish
such
in
this
camp
but
i
regret
to
say
with
no
success
i
opened
a
canteen
here
but
two
years
ago
where
refreshments
were
sold
to
the
new
arrivals
at
from
three
to
five
times
their
value
but
the
evil
servant
to
whom
i
entrusted
the
management
of
this
concern
decamped
with
the
whole
of
the
profits
i
obtained
the
satisfaction
of
having
him
put
to
death
by
a
distant
friend
but
i
was
never
able
to
recover
his
gains
at
another
time
i
entered
into
a
contract
with
certain
brigands
who
hold
the
passes
of
the
mountains
it
was
clearly
understood
between
us
that
they
should
hold
up
the
worshippers
returning
from
my
shrine
and
that
of
the
ransoms
they
collected
should
be
paid
into
my
chests
but
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
not
received
a
penny
on
yet
another
occasion
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
fix
a
regular
tribute
to
replace
the
voluntary
alms
which
though
considerable
leave
room
for
improvement
but
the
alarming
falling
off
in
receipts
and
the
dwindling
of
my
income
made
me
withdraw
the
order
within
six
months
of
its
issue
all
these
experiences
combined
my
dear
mahmoud
said
he
familiarly
thus
showing
that
he
knew
my
true
name
and
disturbing
me
not
a
little
have
convinced
me
that
i
have
not
what
you
men
of
affairs
call
a
business
i
may
have
a
latent
talent
i
may
even
have
a
genius
for
religion
when
i
tell
you
that
i
sometimes
pass
three
days
without
changing
my
position
of
prayer
and
without
taking
food
or
drink
the
whole
performance
watched
by
a
great
crowd
of
astonished
faithful
you
will
agree
that
i
am
not
without
capabilities
of
my
own
but
i
am
reluctantly
convinced
that
what
the
giaours
call
a
good
nose
for
a
deal
is
not
one
of
here
i
began
to
interrupt
him
with
the
usual
compliments
and
would
have
assured
him
that
any
man
of
ability
had
but
to
train
himself
for
affairs
to
do
as
well
as
another
when
he
genially
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
and
said
no
my
dear
mahmoud
again
the
use
of
my
name
disturbed
me
whatever
else
we
are
let
us
not
be
hypocrites
let
us
frankly
acknowledge
our
limitations
you
as
i
am
now
convinced
know
how
to
sell
and
to
buy
and
have
all
the
qualities
for
discovering
the
dearest
and
the
cheapest
markets
much
as
i
have
desired
to
attain
to
the
same
faculties
i
have
failed
and
at
my
age
which
though
it
is
not
the
years
reported
is
at
any
rate
well
over
sixty
it
is
too
late
to
change
i
will
therefore
make
you
what
is
called
i
believe
in
your
world
an
with
what
relief
did
those
words
fall
on
my
ears
i
did
not
realize
for
the
moment
how
greatly
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
have
begun
by
frightening
your
unhappy
uncle
and
what
an
opportunity
this
had
given
him
for
negotiations
i
will
make
you
a
proposition
think
carefully
over
it
and
at
the
end
of
a
reasonable
time
give
me
your
decision
i
offer
you
two
alternatives
the
one
is
that
you
should
continue
your
trade
subject
to
the
supervision
of
my
agents
and
that
when
you
have
reached
a
total
of
pieces
of
gold
you
shall
be
impaled
and
the
money
confiscated
the
other
is
that
you
shall
continue
to
use
your
evident
talents
for
the
furtherance
of
this
trade
but
that
i
shall
be
regarded
as
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
same
with
half
the
takings
the
choice
lies
with
you
pray
pray
take
your
time
undue
haste
has
spoilt
many
an
excellent
business
contract
and
i
would
not
have
you
ruin
your
chances
do
not
he
continued
repressing
my
evident
anxiety
to
accept
his
terms
do
not
let
your
judgment
be
prejudiced
by
any
feeling
of
obligation
think
the
alternatives
over
carefully
and
then
let
me
know
your
conclusion
take
your
restraining
too
great
an
evidence
of
haste
i
told
him
that
my
mind
was
already
made
up
and
that
i
would
be
honoured
to
accept
his
second
offer
i
think
mahmoud
said
he
rising
that
you
have
acted
with
wisdom
though
perhaps
with
a
little
precipitation
let
us
then
regard
the
matter
as
settled
every
evening
my
servants
will
call
upon
you
for
of
your
takings
and
they
meanwhile
will
protect
you
in
every
i
prostrated
myself
once
more
kissed
the
ground
at
his
feet
and
left
the
hut
in
a
very
different
mood
from
that
in
which
i
had
entered
it
i
remained
in
the
camp
for
the
matter
of
about
a
month
i
extended
my
operations
and
every
evening
the
servants
of
the
holy
one
attended
me
and
i
handed
over
half
of
my
takings
during
the
whole
of
that
period
my
capital
continued
to
increase
prodigiously
but
no
good
endures
for
ever
the
time
came
when
this
even
tenor
was
threatened
in
a
very
unexpected
way
the
holy
one
was
visited
by
certain
ambassadors
from
the
grand
something
or
other
residing
in
the
court
of
the
caliph
who
informed
him
that
his
position
was
duly
recognized
by
the
authorities
and
that
they
bore
with
them
an
illuminated
charter
confirming
it
the
temporal
advantages
of
his
holiness
s
trade
however
were
no
less
clearly
evident
to
the
caliph
than
the
religious
ones
and
his
holiness
would
therefore
be
good
enough
in
future
to
hand
over
of
his
receipts
to
the
imperial
treasury
heaven
knows
with
what
bitterness
the
holy
man
agreed
which
having
done
he
sent
for
me
again
and
told
me
that
it
was
now
necessary
for
him
to
ask
me
for
of
my
receipts
in
vain
did
i
point
out
to
him
that
all
great
empires
had
fallen
by
the
increase
of
taxation
he
was
adamant
and
i
therefore
reluctantly
agreed
to
the
new
arrangement
taking
a
solemn
oath
to
observe
it
for
at
least
one
year
but
i
asked
him
whether
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
in
case
i
should
find
the
new
bargain
more
than
i
could
support
i
might
depart
out
of
the
city
to
this
he
agreed
and
confirmed
it
with
an
oath
equally
solemn
that
night
i
put
together
all
my
accumulated
wealth
which
now
filled
not
less
than
four
large
bags
with
gold
and
silver
and
charging
it
upon
the
mule
of
a
peculiarly
devout
and
therefore
unobservant
and
abstracted
pilgrim
and
drawing
the
innocent
beast
away
in
the
darkness
by
the
bridle
i
left
the
camp
as
slowly
and
cautiously
as
i
might
emissaries
were
sent
out
to
kill
me
within
half
an
hour
of
my
departure
as
i
heard
their
approach
i
turned
my
mule
round
towards
the
camp
as
though
i
were
arriving
and
as
they
passed
me
i
said
i
was
a
pilgrim
who
had
lost
his
way
in
the
night
and
asked
if
i
were
on
the
right
road
for
the
shrine
this
simple
ruse
deceived
them
they
went
their
way
and
i
was
alone
once
more
still
their
passage
sufficiently
alarmed
me
i
gave
up
the
road
for
a
less
frequented
path
and
wandered
all
that
night
through
an
unfamiliar
district
for
my
poor
beast
could
go
no
faster
than
a
walking
pace
so
heavy
were
the
bags
of
treasure
which
he
bore
by
dawn
i
felt
myself
secure
and
but
here
the
old
gentleman
heard
the
first
intolerable
note
of
the
muezzin
and
stopped
short
motioning
to
his
nephews
that
they
should
leave
him
which
they
did
with
their
customary
humility
each
wondering
in
his
heart
whether
he
might
not
later
feel
a
vocation
to
the
religious
life
الجديدة
that
is
the
new
quarter
of
the
city
chapter
xii
entitled
or
the
new
quarter
of
the
city
as
i
proceeded
the
next
morning
across
the
waste
continued
mahmoud
to
his
nephews
on
their
next
visit
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
how
best
to
employ
the
considerable
sum
which
my
honest
mule
bore
so
patiently
upon
his
back
here
was
a
year
s
sustenance
for
fifty
labourers
or
more
and
with
so
much
money
a
man
earns
more
for
as
it
is
written
in
the
holy
book
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
but
whatever
is
over
is
not
for
and
again
are
the
there
are
not
wanting
occasions
for
the
employment
of
poorer
men
and
the
gathering
of
the
fruits
of
their
labour
into
one
s
own
pouch
but
there
is
one
difficulty
in
all
such
matters
which
is
the
point
of
judgment
you
will
recollect
my
dear
nephews
how
often
in
the
past
a
most
careful
investment
of
mine
had
gone
wrong
and
how
often
a
mere
hazard
not
even
of
my
own
choosing
had
brought
me
sudden
fortune
how
in
the
matter
of
the
sheep
i
was
beaten
almost
to
death
by
the
while
in
the
matter
of
the
horse
i
had
sold
three
times
over
an
animal
that
had
cost
me
nothing
and
had
fallen
to
me
by
the
pure
goodness
of
god
how
in
the
matter
of
the
dates
i
had
been
left
penniless
by
a
man
of
greater
business
sense
foresight
organizing
ability
eye
for
the
market
knowledge
of
men
and
the
rest
of
the
virtues
while
in
the
matter
of
the
holy
man
i
had
as
my
weary
mule
proved
done
extremely
well
out
of
a
quite
unexpected
accident
even
as
this
last
example
passed
through
my
mind
i
remembered
for
the
first
time
that
the
mule
himself
was
a
new
accession
of
fortune
over
and
above
the
silver
he
carried
for
i
had
not
had
the
inconvenience
of
paying
for
him
he
was
a
fine
beast
and
in
spite
of
his
fatigue
still
looked
well
bred
i
estimated
him
at
quite
ten
pieces
of
gold
and
mentally
added
that
sum
on
my
tablets
to
the
total
value
of
my
possessions
it
was
so
musing
that
i
found
myself
approaching
a
high
tangle
of
reeds
through
which
a
narrow
path
wound
and
was
lost
to
view
on
this
path
i
engaged
the
reeds
on
either
side
were
so
tall
as
to
hide
the
farther
landscape
and
so
closely
set
that
one
could
see
but
a
few
yards
into
their
mass
after
perhaps
an
hour
of
such
journeying
my
mule
and
i
came
out
suddenly
upon
the
firm
bank
of
a
broad
and
shallow
river
whose
noise
and
coolness
swift
current
and
clear
stream
were
a
delight
after
so
many
hours
of
arid
travel
there
did
i
sit
me
down
there
did
i
unload
and
hobble
my
patient
companion
there
did
we
drink
of
the
good
water
and
there
did
the
mule
eat
plentifully
of
cool
grass
but
i
made
no
meal
for
the
and
cheese
which
i
had
taken
from
the
common
table
of
the
poor
in
the
pilgrims
camp
were
now
exhausted
it
was
this
circumstance
which
made
me
a
little
anxious
for
the
day
i
looked
about
me
stood
up
on
the
highest
part
of
the
bank
and
then
saw
that
the
shore
opposite
had
been
artificially
heightened
to
form
a
regular
levee
or
embankment
beyond
which
the
flat
country
was
hidden
i
determined
to
seek
this
point
of
advantage
for
a
view
i
reloaded
my
mule
carefully
forded
the
stream
in
its
various
branches
and
climbed
to
the
farther
shore
at
the
summit
of
the
embankment
which
was
evidently
of
recent
construction
my
effort
was
well
rewarded
for
i
saw
a
sight
that
set
at
rest
all
anxiety
for
food
and
shelter
the
embankment
on
which
i
stood
swept
round
in
a
horseshoe
shape
not
everywhere
finished
but
everywhere
traced
out
it
thus
enclosed
a
peninsula
bounded
by
the
river
a
space
of
marshy
ground
full
of
stagnant
pools
and
three
or
four
furlongs
away
cutting
across
the
whole
neck
of
the
horseshoe
of
swamp
and
stretching
from
the
river
to
the
river
again
ran
the
stone
wall
of
a
strong
town
the
flat
roofs
and
low
domes
of
which
it
had
no
tower
or
minaret
made
a
ridge
of
against
the
intense
blue
of
the
sky
far
away
beyond
were
distant
mountains
purple
in
the
heat
scattered
over
the
swamp
itself
and
on
the
unfinished
sections
of
the
embankment
were
groups
of
labourers
working
with
spades
and
barrows
and
overseeing
them
nearby
to
me
a
young
man
of
energetic
carriage
well
dressed
in
a
brown
garment
rich
but
suitable
to
his
work
and
girded
he
had
no
sandals
for
they
would
have
impeded
him
on
such
ground
he
bore
an
inlaid
ebon
staff
with
an
ivory
and
was
occupied
when
i
first
saw
him
in
shouting
a
new
order
to
a
distant
group
of
diggers
his
back
was
towards
me
he
had
not
seen
my
approach
as
he
turned
to
proceed
along
the
levee
towards
another
group
he
caught
sight
of
my
mule
and
myself
and
at
once
started
to
run
pouring
out
when
he
had
reached
us
a
mixed
flood
of
greetings
warnings
and
varied
exclamations
we
were
to
beware
of
the
embankment
it
was
but
just
raised
and
was
not
yet
stable
was
it
not
a
fine
work
as
we
saw
it
it
had
taken
but
three
months
did
i
notice
how
thoroughly
it
had
cut
off
the
river
had
i
not
found
it
firm
as
i
came
up
it
from
the
bank
would
i
be
pleased
to
go
carefully
lest
the
edge
should
be
injured
and
so
on
it
was
clear
from
such
a
salutation
with
what
sort
of
man
i
had
to
deal
here
was
an
enthusiast
it
is
a
character
of
the
utmost
service
to
the
man
of
affairs
he
was
of
that
sort
which
is
labelled
in
our
indexes
as
the
constructive
wild
man
and
happy
is
the
captain
of
industry
who
chances
upon
such
a
one
he
was
perhaps
thirty
years
of
age
strong
short
in
stature
very
dark
in
complexion
with
steady
but
eager
eyes
and
such
an
expression
of
grasp
resolution
and
immediate
decision
as
should
lead
to
a
fortune
not
perhaps
for
himself
but
at
least
for
anyone
who
knew
how
to
use
him
for
he
was
as
keen
as
a
boy
upon
the
matter
occupying
him
and
therefore
careless
for
the
moment
of
all
other
things
i
answered
him
with
a
mixture
of
sympathy
caution
and
gravity
which
i
was
glad
to
see
impressed
him
i
praised
his
work
vaguely
but
courteously
enough
i
asked
the
names
of
the
river
and
the
town
and
also
his
own
all
these
he
gave
me
and
then
asked
me
whether
i
would
not
share
the
meal
he
was
about
to
take
i
said
i
should
be
overjoyed
to
do
so
and
so
i
was
for
i
saw
the
prospect
of
refreshment
at
the
charges
of
another
an
opportunity
which
remember
my
dear
nephews
is
never
to
be
neglected
by
men
of
clear
commercial
judgment
he
led
me
followed
by
the
mule
to
a
shady
place
where
a
few
trees
stood
on
a
drier
part
of
the
enclosed
plain
there
we
found
excellent
meats
and
there
we
reclined
for
above
an
hour
during
the
whole
of
which
he
did
not
cease
to
overwhelm
me
with
description
praise
and
prospect
of
the
great
enterprise
in
which
he
was
wholly
absorbed
this
horseshoe
bend
he
told
me
outside
his
native
town
had
never
been
utilized
it
was
flooded
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
melted
on
the
distant
hills
the
rest
of
the
year
it
was
a
mixture
of
dry
cracked
mud
and
marsh
breeding
fever
full
of
insects
and
at
evening
he
had
been
left
an
orphan
and
was
apprenticed
to
a
maker
of
such
as
were
used
in
the
stream
above
the
city
one
day
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
that
such
instruments
could
be
used
not
only
for
the
grinding
of
corn
but
for
the
raising
of
water
from
ditches
and
therefore
for
draining
with
that
his
grand
project
had
rushed
into
his
mind
why
should
not
the
marsh
which
had
so
far
been
so
serious
a
trouble
be
turned
to
the
profit
of
the
city
an
embankment
would
keep
out
floods
drains
cut
through
the
enclosed
marsh
would
collect
the
water
and
dry
the
whole
these
drains
could
be
regularly
pumped
out
by
wheels
which
the
outer
stream
would
turn
and
a
large
area
of
good
land
would
be
added
to
the
crowded
town
on
this
new
buildings
could
be
raised
and
gardens
laid
out
to
the
great
profit
of
all
the
citizens
for
the
city
was
increasing
in
importance
people
were
flocking
in
there
was
crowding
and
difficulty
and
high
rents
yet
no
place
over
which
to
expand
between
the
marsh
and
the
hills
he
had
approached
the
council
and
headmen
with
this
project
they
had
hesitated
long
at
last
they
had
grudgingly
advanced
from
the
taxes
a
sum
which
he
warned
them
was
inadequate
nevertheless
he
had
set
to
work
and
the
results
were
now
before
me
the
swamp
was
still
swamp
the
embankment
not
completed
of
the
drains
not
more
than
a
sixth
were
dug
and
the
whole
was
a
confusion
of
apparent
ruin
and
chaos
very
unattractive
to
the
eye
and
very
unpromising
in
its
outward
aspect
at
least
of
any
result
it
had
all
the
character
of
waste
and
folly
yet
a
sum
of
money
small
in
comparison
with
many
private
resources
and
insignificant
in
the
budget
of
the
town
would
suffice
to
crown
the
whole
and
to
replace
the
wretched
prospect
of
unfinished
labour
by
a
noble
plain
of
rich
gardens
and
new
houses
but
the
headmen
of
the
city
were
now
disgusted
and
would
vote
no
more
rather
did
they
threaten
him
with
penalties
for
his
loss
of
public
pence
i
had
during
this
torrent
of
talk
interjected
here
and
there
a
question
and
no
more
i
had
spoken
guardedly
and
yet
with
no
disrespect
for
his
enthusiasm
i
had
as
we
say
among
the
merchants
sounded
i
asked
him
in
conclusion
what
sum
he
thought
necessary
for
the
completion
of
his
enterprise
he
named
gold
pieces
about
of
what
lay
concealed
in
my
sacks
upon
the
ground
which
sacks
i
had
casually
informed
him
were
filled
with
coarse
grain
from
the
hills
upon
hearing
this
sum
given
a
sum
so
well
within
my
means
an
interior
light
broke
upon
me
i
did
not
pray
for
guidance
as
is
my
custom
in
any
business
dealing
of
doubt
i
was
directly
and
immediately
inspired
to
this
i
owe
the
whole
of
my
present
position
for
it
was
the
foundation
of
all
that
followed
i
had
suffered
vicissitude
it
is
the
lot
of
man
but
henceforward
my
soul
was
to
be
filled
with
increasing
and
wealth
until
i
should
be
able
to
call
myself
as
i
do
now
by
far
the
richest
man
in
all
the
caliphate
and
perhaps
in
the
world
this
my
dear
nephews
was
the
the
old
man
s
eyes
were
full
of
tears
his
voice
trembled
never
had
the
awestruck
boys
imagined
that
their
uncle
in
his
greatness
and
serenity
could
be
so
moved
oh
my
children
he
continued
in
broken
accents
never
forget
in
your
own
lives
this
master
precept
that
of
all
those
whom
allah
presents
to
us
for
exploitation
none
none
is
so
lucrative
as
the
creative
enthusiast
the
man
who
can
make
and
produce
and
yet
be
managed
the
genius
devoid
of
guile
you
may
know
him
that
rare
jewel
by
his
the
old
man
recovered
himself
with
dignity
wiped
his
eyes
on
a
piece
of
priceless
embroidered
silk
from
samarcand
threw
it
out
of
the
window
and
in
his
more
usual
tone
pursued
the
recital
of
his
fortunes
the
young
man
never
dreamt
that
such
a
chance
and
dusty
traveller
as
i
with
my
one
mule
could
help
him
he
had
merely
burst
out
with
his
story
to
me
as
he
would
have
done
to
any
human
being
that
would
hear
him
i
had
the
more
advantage
of
him
from
his
ignorance
of
my
real
wealth
i
told
him
soberly
at
the
end
of
his
tale
that
it
interested
me
greatly
that
his
idea
was
evidently
sound
but
that
the
stupidity
ignorance
and
suspicion
of
town
councillors
were
common
not
only
to
his
city
but
to
all
others
a
thing
which
i
who
had
travelled
widely
could
judge
i
assured
him
out
of
a
vast
experience
which
he
accepted
with
the
utmost
simplicity
that
he
could
hope
for
no
more
from
such
a
source
i
then
fell
into
a
sort
of
bemused
condition
as
though
i
were
ruminating
what
could
next
be
done
the
young
man
his
hopes
now
turned
into
a
new
channel
and
after
so
brief
an
acquaintance
for
such
is
the
nature
of
these
enthusiasts
already
beginning
to
look
to
me
for
aid
watched
my
face
most
anxiously
i
continued
silent
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
asked
me
impetuously
what
i
should
advise
where
could
he
turn
what
could
be
done
it
would
be
a
tragedy
a
murder
for
his
great
scheme
to
fail
merely
because
its
obvious
advantage
could
not
be
put
before
anyone
who
had
the
provision
of
gold
pieces
necessary
for
paying
the
labourers
till
the
plan
was
achieved
he
sprang
to
his
feet
he
walked
feverishly
up
and
down
he
betrayed
all
the
symptoms
of
his
case
i
answered
him
with
great
deliberation
and
firmness
i
said
first
of
all
that
i
had
nothing
it
was
a
pity
for
i
thoroughly
understood
his
idea
i
admired
it
i
believed
in
it
indeed
it
was
obviously
sound
if
i
had
had
the
wherewithal
said
i
i
would
at
once
have
made
the
advance
if
i
had
had
even
a
portion
i
would
have
put
that
portion
at
his
disposal
if
only
to
show
my
sincere
appreciation
of
his
genius
for
it
was
the
neglect
of
men
like
himself
i
continued
that
hindered
the
progress
of
the
world
but
so
it
was
i
had
but
my
trade
as
an
itinerant
merchant
in
grain
to
support
myself
and
a
very
large
family
which
i
had
left
at
home
in
the
hills
i
had
nothing
laid
by
however
my
annual
tour
through
this
and
neighbouring
provinces
brought
me
into
contact
these
were
my
very
words
with
many
notables
possessed
of
ample
reserves
in
this
very
town
now
that
he
had
told
me
its
name
i
remembered
two
or
three
correspondents
with
whom
i
had
done
business
in
the
past
though
i
had
never
seen
them
these
i
would
approach
and
if
he
would
give
me
an
appointment
that
evening
after
sunset
i
would
tell
him
if
i
had
been
able
to
effect
anything
he
overwhelmed
me
with
thanks
led
me
to
an
excellent
house
of
call
in
the
town
and
leaving
me
there
with
an
appointed
hour
for
our
meeting
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
his
labours
with
a
lighter
heart
i
for
my
part
retired
to
an
inner
room
which
i
had
hired
there
disposed
of
my
baggage
having
seen
to
the
stabling
and
feeding
of
my
honest
mule
and
instantly
fell
upon
my
knees
to
thank
allah
with
all
the
fervour
i
could
muster
for
his
abounding
grace
indeed
my
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
when
i
considered
the
quite
exceptional
opportunity
i
felt
about
this
young
man
as
does
a
caravan
when
after
a
weary
march
through
the
desert
there
gleams
a
pure
lake
not
half
an
hour
away
how
short
a
space
of
time
now
lay
between
this
moment
and
the
beginnings
of
splendid
negotiations
having
so
prayed
with
the
deepest
sincerity
and
humility
i
first
took
out
exactly
hundred
pieces
of
gold
from
my
sacks
tied
them
into
a
kerchief
about
my
person
and
then
lay
down
upon
a
mat
to
sleep
first
warning
the
servants
of
the
place
to
wake
me
when
the
young
man
should
return
i
slept
soundly
for
many
hours
when
they
woke
me
it
was
already
dark
i
rose
at
once
lit
the
lamp
and
received
my
young
friend
into
the
room
all
was
silent
we
were
alone
under
the
one
light
of
that
subdued
flame
the
hour
was
propitious
for
what
i
had
undertaken
i
told
him
that
i
had
spent
the
interval
since
he
left
me
in
seeking
my
wealthy
correspondents
and
in
making
myself
acquainted
with
their
views
upon
the
town
s
circumstances
and
upon
the
opportunities
for
investment
i
said
that
i
had
briefly
and
very
cautiously
mentioned
the
works
i
saw
going
on
in
the
swamp
as
i
had
approached
their
city
and
that
i
had
discovered
at
once
by
their
pitying
contempt
for
his
enterprise
that
there
was
no
chance
at
all
of
interesting
them
in
its
progress
they
called
it
as
did
all
their
a
folly
they
bitterly
regretted
the
public
money
that
had
already
been
advanced
they
would
certainly
advance
no
more
they
talked
freely
of
bringing
him
to
trial
for
wasting
the
public
revenue
as
for
any
private
investment
of
their
own
fortunes
i
clearly
saw
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
here
i
paused
to
let
this
information
sink
in
and
was
pleased
to
observe
the
growing
dejection
of
his
features
but
before
he
could
voice
his
despair
though
he
had
expected
as
much
i
relieved
him
by
another
strain
i
told
him
i
had
raised
a
certain
sum
partly
upon
the
security
of
my
known
stores
of
grain
of
which
i
was
carrying
samples
pointing
to
the
bags
on
the
floor
that
contained
my
money
partly
on
my
own
personal
security
as
an
honest
merchant
poor
but
of
regular
and
punctual
habit
in
payment
i
had
secured
a
loan
which
i
had
told
them
was
for
the
general
purpose
of
increasing
my
business
but
which
in
point
of
fact
i
intended
to
put
at
his
disposal
such
confidence
had
i
in
his
scheme
i
feared
it
would
be
insufficient
but
it
would
be
a
beginning
later
we
might
find
further
means
his
honest
eager
face
changed
as
i
spoke
it
was
delightful
to
feel
that
i
could
give
so
much
joy
however
brief
to
so
candid
a
soul
he
had
however
a
certain
scruple
he
said
it
was
not
his
business
but
he
would
rather
there
had
been
no
ambiguity
and
the
money
advanced
for
a
purpose
known
to
the
lenders
i
praised
the
nobility
of
such
hesitation
but
i
pointed
out
that
the
risk
was
mine
that
i
had
only
spoken
of
a
general
purpose
of
increasing
my
business
no
false
phrase
that
i
was
so
certain
of
success
that
the
loan
was
at
any
rate
secure
in
any
case
business
of
which
he
had
little
acquaintance
was
always
conducted
on
such
lines
i
assured
him
and
my
backers
being
also
business
men
would
be
the
last
to
split
hairs
on
points
of
honour
when
i
paid
back
their
loan
this
soothed
him
and
he
was
now
quite
prepared
for
what
followed
i
asked
him
again
what
sum
he
required
he
told
me
he
employed
a
hundred
labourers
that
their
wages
came
to
twenty
gold
pieces
a
week
and
that
he
estimated
fifteen
weeks
as
the
very
least
period
in
which
the
whole
ground
could
be
cleared
and
dried
and
set
out
in
all
he
repeated
hundred
pieces
of
gold
would
be
required
as
he
had
said
i
noted
to
myself
privately
once
more
that
it
was
of
my
hoard
and
then
when
he
had
completed
his
calculation
i
thus
addressed
him
it
is
as
i
feared
the
sum
i
have
obtained
is
hardly
sufficient
i
have
raised
but
hundred
pieces
of
gold
his
face
fell
again
but
that
will
take
us
pretty
far
i
went
on
we
may
with
care
complete
our
work
and
the
rest
of
it
should
be
easy
to
it
has
always
surprised
me
how
exact
such
men
are
in
judgment
and
yet
how
little
they
use
their
talent
to
their
own
advantage
he
was
anxious
he
was
certain
that
beginning
on
too
small
a
sum
was
dangerous
but
i
persuaded
him
for
no
more
said
i
could
possibly
be
obtained
what
made
all
smooth
was
my
proposal
for
articles
between
us
these
generously
proposed
that
though
i
had
found
the
money
yet
of
the
resultant
profit
we
should
take
equal
shares
i
propose
that
your
own
salary
during
the
work
said
i
should
be
small
indeed
no
more
than
your
bare
maintenance
for
we
have
no
margin
nay
less
than
we
need
but
if
you
are
not
agreeable
pray
name
your
he
could
find
no
words
for
my
generosity
of
course
he
would
live
on
the
least
possible
sum
and
work
to
an
extreme
he
had
no
right
said
he
to
claim
a
half
it
was
achievement
not
fortune
that
he
desired
i
insisted
he
gratefully
yielded
we
drew
up
the
document
in
duplicate
he
was
especially
gratified
to
find
that
i
had
left
the
whole
direction
to
him
i
know
nothing
of
such
things
i
said
i
am
only
the
business
man
you
are
the
creator
the
artist
i
am
but
the
base
mercantile
instrument
and
i
shall
be
proud
to
share
in
your
as
i
said
this
i
put
into
my
eyes
the
expression
of
inspired
admiration
which
we
of
the
commercial
world
very
properly
assume
when
we
are
dealing
with
this
kind
of
fodder
the
next
morning
in
the
cool
before
the
sun
had
power
our
deeds
were
attested
i
warned
him
to
be
utterly
silent
upon
the
source
of
this
capital
i
said
i
would
be
responsible
for
a
rumour
that
a
small
saving
of
his
own
was
engaged
he
saw
my
point
and
though
still
scrupulous
consented
the
work
went
forward
my
next
step
i
had
already
planned
i
had
privately
set
aside
for
it
a
fixed
sum
the
equal
of
what
i
had
given
my
partner
i
hired
a
pleasant
little
house
and
garden
in
the
city
with
a
fountain
of
clear
water
in
its
shaded
court
i
purchased
a
stock
of
good
clothes
and
even
one
or
two
not
jewels
and
i
began
to
entertain
i
bought
at
a
price
which
gave
me
pause
a
really
wonderful
cook
i
learnt
the
games
of
hazard
to
which
the
wealthier
of
the
place
were
devoted
the
headmen
of
the
various
quarters
of
the
city
the
principal
councillors
and
magistrates
learned
one
from
another
of
the
excellence
of
my
table
and
the
interest
of
my
play
i
became
their
intimate
from
time
to
time
i
spoke
of
my
friendship
with
the
enthusiast
and
of
my
regret
at
his
wasting
his
poor
savings
upon
the
dreadful
mess
outside
the
walls
they
agreed
and
all
the
while
that
fervid
young
man
redoubled
his
ardour
himself
worked
side
by
side
with
his
men
planned
urged
them
on
and
effected
prodigies
of
labour
indeed
i
feared
for
his
health
a
natural
anxiety
for
one
in
my
situation
but
by
the
mercy
of
allah
it
remained
perfect
he
now
however
came
to
me
more
and
more
frequently
and
in
a
greater
and
greater
anxiety
there
were
but
fifty
gold
pieces
remaining
but
forty
but
twenty
it
was
a
matter
of
a
few
days
already
he
had
had
to
keep
back
wages
to
devise
even
to
discharge
men
could
i
not
oh
could
i
not
raise
some
further
sum
as
he
had
said
the
work
needed
another
month
at
least
and
its
present
state
was
appalling
no
visible
security
for
a
loan
all
mud
and
confusion
i
could
only
reply
that
i
would
do
my
best
but
that
i
was
not
sanguine
and
my
long
face
increased
his
fears
perturbed
as
he
was
he
had
the
generosity
to
regret
loss
in
the
unfortunate
enterprise
i
showed
a
strong
indifference
and
told
him
that
i
was
used
to
the
rubs
of
this
sad
world
and
that
my
trust
was
in
allah
at
last
as
the
day
when
his
funds
would
be
exhausted
was
at
hand
i
gave
a
feast
of
special
importance
to
the
treasurer
and
the
chief
magistrates
of
the
city
and
there
led
the
talk
on
to
the
works
still
continuing
i
heard
the
usual
grumble
that
the
sum
originally
advanced
out
of
the
taxes
was
sunk
in
a
morass
that
the
young
man
had
apparently
funds
of
his
own
for
continuing
the
nonsense
and
that
yet
the
city
could
recover
nothing
from
him
i
approved
a
threat
that
out
of
sheer
annoyance
they
might
stop
the
whole
thing
and
put
him
in
gaol
till
he
should
pay
or
at
any
rate
suffer
for
his
unsettled
debt
to
his
then
it
was
that
i
struck
for
the
hour
was
ripe
i
pleaded
for
him
as
a
friend
i
let
them
feel
my
influence
i
waited
for
the
suggestion
and
i
was
not
disappointed
the
treasurer
after
a
little
solemn
hesitation
said
to
me
sir
since
you
know
this
young
fellow
and
seem
to
be
in
his
councils
can
you
not
discover
what
remains
to
him
and
perhaps
make
him
reimburse
the
gold
pieces
he
owes
to
our
we
should
be
beholden
to
i
answered
that
my
intimacy
with
the
enthusiast
hardly
went
so
far
but
that
i
would
do
my
best
only
i
begged
them
for
the
interval
of
a
week
the
day
after
the
morrow
of
that
feast
the
young
man
came
to
me
in
an
excessive
perturbation
the
mud
of
his
travail
was
still
on
his
hands
and
i
was
concerned
to
see
him
limping
from
the
effect
as
he
told
me
of
a
heavy
barrow
which
had
overset
as
he
wheeled
it
and
crushed
his
big
toe
but
he
neglected
the
pain
in
his
extreme
mental
distress
and
told
me
that
having
paid
that
week
s
wages
his
gold
pieces
were
now
reduced
to
even
if
he
himself
ate
but
dry
bread
in
the
next
few
days
and
sold
his
poor
belongings
he
could
not
meet
the
next
account
which
was
but
seven
days
distant
i
cast
my
eyes
on
the
ground
and
delayed
a
while
the
more
to
impress
him
i
then
told
him
in
grave
and
subdued
tones
that
i
had
very
bad
news
i
glanced
up
a
moment
to
note
the
wildness
in
his
eyes
upon
this
blow
then
cast
them
down
at
the
ground
and
continued
i
have
private
advice
perhaps
i
should
not
have
divulged
it
to
you
for
it
was
given
in
confidence
but
my
concern
and
affection
for
you
have
proved
too
strong
i
have
private
advice
that
the
council
intend
this
very
week
to
demand
most
formally
the
repayment
of
pieces
of
gold
which
they
say
is
due
from
you
for
advances
long
ago
made
and
failing
payment
to
cast
you
into
their
the
young
man
leapt
suddenly
to
his
feet
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
made
to
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
held
his
hands
and
restrained
him
oh
curse
my
birth
he
cried
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
and
curse
my
generation
my
day
has
come
he
raved
he
incoherently
demanded
miracles
and
alternately
denied
the
justice
of
allah
grown
more
subdued
but
still
distraught
he
moaned
of
his
affections
he
told
me
what
i
had
hitherto
not
known
and
what
interested
me
very
little
that
he
had
a
little
sister
orphaned
as
he
was
who
if
he
were
put
away
would
starve
or
become
the
prey
of
strangers
what
could
be
done
what
refuge
discovered
curse
the
day
when
his
fatal
dream
had
struck
him
curse
his
works
curse
the
river
curse
the
marsh
curse
the
city
and
so
on
the
usual
reaction
of
enthusiasts
it
was
most
distressing
i
still
held
his
writhing
hands
firmly
till
he
was
calm
enough
to
hear
me
and
then
said
listen
to
me
i
have
considered
your
case
i
think
i
can
rescue
you
i
have
myself
saved
a
little
from
my
trading
operations
of
the
last
two
months
in
this
town
my
credit
also
is
somewhat
extended
will
find
what
you
need
for
i
respect
genius
and
i
do
not
judge
by
common
standards
i
was
proceeding
when
he
burst
out
into
extravagant
gratitude
called
me
his
benefactor
kissed
my
hand
again
and
again
and
irrelevantly
alluded
again
to
that
little
sister
of
his
who
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
i
checked
him
and
continued
i
will
do
more
you
do
not
know
your
own
value
i
mean
your
own
moral
and
intellectual
worth
nor
what
admiration
they
excite
in
men
who
judge
as
i
do
that
the
rest
is
dross
our
enterprise
is
clearly
lost
he
nodded
his
agreement
my
investment
you
may
say
is
gone
or
at
any
rate
i
must
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
as
a
thing
and
gravely
threatened
by
the
authorities
but
shall
not
go
under
high
talents
shall
not
be
wasted
so
long
as
i
have
credit
for
commerce
come
our
original
agreement
is
useless
now
it
is
waste
paper
well
we
ll
tear
it
oh
sir
said
he
and
what
of
all
this
trust
in
me
and
my
work
all
this
fund
of
money
laid
out
by
you
all
this
kindness
and
support
without
which
i
say
no
more
i
interrupted
my
mind
is
made
up
i
have
here
a
draft
of
my
intention
which
i
hope
will
jump
with
so
saying
i
pulled
out
duplicate
papers
on
which
were
written
very
simple
terms
the
original
and
now
worthless
agreement
for
an
imaginary
and
unobtainable
profit
was
cancelled
i
promised
in
the
new
draft
to
take
over
the
wretched
unfinished
works
they
were
worth
nothing
to
indemnify
the
poor
fellow
against
any
public
claims
and
to
guarantee
him
an
ample
salary
for
one
year
from
the
date
of
signing
i
now
added
more
i
bound
myself
in
the
event
of
his
death
or
prolonged
imprisonment
within
this
year
to
pay
to
his
heirs
the
sum
of
pieces
of
gold
this
i
pointed
out
to
him
would
provide
for
his
little
sister
of
whom
i
had
now
heard
enough
while
to
myself
i
excused
the
extravagance
by
considering
his
really
robust
health
and
the
power
of
my
protection
to
save
him
from
incarceration
i
would
not
have
believed
that
a
human
being
could
feel
so
strongly
he
fell
at
my
feet
calling
me
his
providence
his
all
his
bulwark
and
refuge
he
said
he
did
not
know
there
was
such
goodness
among
men
i
bade
him
not
exaggerate
i
reminded
him
how
noble
minds
had
in
all
ages
loved
to
support
the
arts
and
cited
muswuf
wawoo
mah
and
other
worthies
at
last
our
business
was
completed
the
new
deeds
signed
and
attested
by
my
servants
and
the
gallant
fellow
for
whose
ingenuous
character
i
still
retain
a
profound
respect
was
put
to
sleep
in
happy
exhaustion
upon
soft
carpets
in
my
i
there
left
him
to
dream
of
his
little
sister
and
his
while
i
betook
myself
to
a
short
of
accounts
followed
by
nightly
prayers
to
the
who
guides
his
servant
into
pleasant
places
next
morning
i
sent
the
enthusiast
back
to
his
labours
with
a
little
cash
to
carry
on
with
and
very
carefully
thought
out
my
plans
first
at
the
next
dinner
i
gave
i
told
my
guests
who
were
as
usual
among
the
chief
men
of
the
city
that
i
proposed
a
deal
in
corn
with
the
factors
of
tambulistan
the
place
did
not
as
a
fact
exist
but
the
name
was
well
chosen
and
attractive
they
were
distant
i
said
but
in
correspondence
with
me
and
as
they
had
a
glut
and
i
had
news
of
a
dearth
in
my
own
country
i
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
a
deal
through
third
parties
i
saw
a
profit
of
some
pieces
of
gold
not
more
said
i
i
was
a
modest
man
and
only
did
business
in
a
small
way
my
guests
gallantly
denied
this
and
smiled
in
polite
interest
but
no
more
till
a
little
later
in
the
meal
i
said
that
the
transaction
had
been
just
a
little
heavy
for
me
and
that
i
had
looked
round
for
some
one
who
would
help
in
settlement
and
would
share
the
profit
i
told
them
this
profit
was
fairly
certain
that
no
ready
cash
was
required
more
than
i
had
myself
provided
but
that
as
a
bill
or
two
would
do
no
harm
i
had
obtained
one
from
a
friend
at
home
all
this
in
the
way
of
general
talk
as
might
be
expected
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
town
my
most
honoured
guest
approached
me
after
dinner
and
told
me
privately
that
he
would
be
happy
to
oblige
i
told
him
there
was
no
sort
of
necessity
i
could
draw
what
i
would
on
my
letters
from
home
or
at
any
rate
enough
to
meet
the
case
that
if
he
cared
to
share
my
little
adventure
i
expected
about
ten
per
cent
profit
on
the
sum
engaged
but
indeed
it
was
too
small
for
me
to
trouble
him
with
it
i
accepted
his
pledge
of
pieces
of
gold
but
i
stoutly
refused
any
paper
your
name
is
enough
i
said
i
shall
gratefully
use
it
my
people
will
trust
my
i
gave
out
next
morning
that
i
was
going
into
the
hills
to
meet
a
messenger
i
did
indeed
pass
through
the
city
gate
and
proceeded
till
i
was
well
out
of
sight
but
as
there
was
no
sense
in
fatiguing
myself
i
slept
through
the
heat
in
a
wood
watched
through
the
warm
night
and
returned
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
i
met
the
chief
magistrate
in
the
bazaar
i
stopped
him
chatted
and
then
and
there
paid
him
eleven
pieces
of
gold
i
met
my
messenger
from
tambulistan
said
i
we
exchanged
parcels
and
i
find
i
have
netted
just
over
the
ten
per
cent
these
eleven
pieces
are
your
proportion
upon
your
kind
investment
of
he
protested
of
course
that
it
had
been
no
investment
merely
a
few
friendly
words
of
support
but
he
took
the
money
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
pleased
he
was
curiously
pleased
indeed
he
was
so
pleased
that
though
a
discreet
man
he
could
not
forbear
mentioning
the
matter
to
his
wife
rich
men
love
small
windfalls
in
a
few
hours
therefore
the
head
mufti
the
chief
of
the
guard
and
two
very
important
councillors
had
in
their
various
ways
touched
casually
upon
the
wheat
trade
during
short
conversations
in
which
each
had
separately
engaged
me
under
the
shades
of
the
bazaar
a
little
later
as
i
took
the
air
by
the
riverside
at
evening
the
principal
ascetic
of
the
district
who
had
come
in
to
buy
his
few
lentils
for
the
week
spoke
to
me
briefly
of
the
same
matter
i
gave
each
of
them
a
different
answer
alluding
to
various
cargoes
of
wheat
caravans
of
wheat
and
tumbrils
of
wheat
all
in
technical
terms
to
risks
to
covering
sums
to
transfers
from
one
district
to
another
in
each
case
i
refused
anything
but
a
pledge
to
stand
in
with
a
transaction
somewhat
beyond
my
unaided
powers
in
each
case
i
ridiculed
the
smallness
of
the
little
adventure
in
each
case
i
paid
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
to
one
a
single
piece
of
gold
as
his
profit
to
another
two
to
another
three
and
each
was
very
pleased
as
the
days
went
by
i
varied
the
procedure
sometimes
i
regretted
the
unexpectedly
small
profit
obtained
once
i
deliberately
announced
a
loss
and
sternly
gathered
reluctant
contributions
from
my
associates
but
immediately
afterwards
i
did
another
fine
stroke
in
imaginary
wheat
and
paid
a
fat
dividend
to
my
friends
indeed
that
particular
affair
cost
me
pieces
but
it
was
worth
it
i
got
rid
in
less
than
a
month
of
pieces
of
gold
in
this
fashion
it
was
a
cruel
trial
but
proved
in
the
event
most
fruitful
for
though
i
would
never
advise
in
large
investments
yet
by
this
simple
method
my
reputation
for
judgment
in
that
which
men
most
value
which
is
money
was
assured
i
had
set
pieces
aside
for
this
experiment
and
my
total
stock
was
running
low
when
i
steered
my
ship
to
port
first
out
of
my
remainder
i
brought
to
the
city
council
fifty
pieces
of
gold
saying
that
i
had
with
difficulty
screwed
them
from
my
young
friend
who
was
still
digging
away
in
the
outskirts
but
that
he
had
faithfully
promised
the
second
fifty
in
two
months
time
next
i
created
a
sort
of
stupor
in
the
now
large
circle
of
my
friends
by
saying
publicly
and
boldly
that
i
was
beginning
to
see
something
in
this
plan
of
draining
the
marsh
i
reminded
them
that
the
engineer
had
always
been
my
friend
that
i
had
always
seen
something
in
him
that
in
spite
of
his
obvious
lack
of
business
sense
i
could
not
help
admiring
his
talent
in
his
own
line
the
place
was
by
this
time
dried
and
levelled
the
embankment
was
all
fairly
sloped
and
paved
the
cuttings
heaps
and
rubbish
had
disappeared
then
it
was
that
i
took
a
party
of
these
my
important
friends
out
to
view
the
place
at
evening
from
the
city
walls
and
quietly
told
them
that
it
was
mine
there
it
lay
before
them
a
magnificent
plain
reclaimed
and
ordered
firm
land
pegged
out
in
rows
and
with
neat
placards
of
new
streets
all
named
you
know
my
dear
nephews
the
admiration
excited
in
all
men
of
affairs
for
one
who
has
forestalled
them
i
rose
in
the
estimation
of
my
neighbours
to
a
height
beyond
compare
they
already
had
a
most
deep
reverence
for
my
keen
perceptions
in
commerce
which
had
been
proved
in
so
many
little
tips
insignificant
in
quantity
but
oh
so
universally
accurate
now
indeed
upon
learning
this
great
stroke
or
as
they
called
it
in
the
local
language
koo
they
were
lost
in
surprise
and
respect
after
sunset
i
counted
my
money
i
had
left
precisely
fifty
pieces
of
gold
a
close
aim
a
narrow
edge
of
venture
but
as
the
proverb
says
the
bold
hunter
slays
the
lion
the
timid
is
slain
of
the
it
was
late
in
that
same
night
that
the
chief
magistrate
knocked
at
my
door
with
the
greatest
precaution
bearing
a
hooded
lantern
and
walking
on
tiptoe
he
begged
me
as
an
old
friend
but
in
a
whisper
to
sell
him
so
much
land
in
the
new
quarter
as
might
suffice
for
a
good
house
and
garden
suitable
for
his
son
or
even
for
himself
i
told
him
that
i
would
have
no
sordid
dealings
with
so
excellent
a
friend
i
could
not
do
less
than
him
such
a
site
i
brought
out
a
plan
on
which
the
engineer
had
already
drawn
out
streets
and
public
squares
and
marked
upon
the
main
thoroughfare
the
plot
i
would
assign
to
him
he
departed
with
praise
and
blessings
hardly
had
he
gone
when
a
yet
more
furtive
step
approached
my
door
it
was
the
mufti
he
offered
me
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
for
such
a
site
i
generously
gave
him
for
a
larger
one
than
he
had
ventured
to
beg
i
marked
it
somewhat
farther
down
the
same
main
thoroughfare
he
went
away
belauding
my
name
and
soul
it
was
near
midnight
when
another
footfall
halted
at
my
door
a
councillor
s
for
fifty
pieces
he
also
had
a
site
worth
double
and
in
the
same
street
he
had
not
gone
an
hour
it
was
the
darkest
of
the
night
when
a
much
fainter
shuffling
of
bare
feet
could
be
just
perceived
followed
by
a
light
trying
of
the
latch
the
door
was
opened
a
crack
and
the
strong
emaciated
face
of
the
ascetic
twisted
round
the
edge
and
peered
in
i
beckoned
him
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
cautiously
secured
the
fastening
of
the
lock
and
then
bending
forward
whispered
in
my
ear
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
magnitude
of
his
offer
but
of
course
i
accepted
it
at
once
such
men
have
great
influence
with
the
faithful
he
proposed
to
his
property
or
perhaps
to
hold
for
a
rise
he
would
continue
of
course
to
live
in
his
humble
cell
outside
the
city
in
the
wastes
he
departed
quickly
and
like
a
ghost
at
dawn
came
yet
another
councillor
more
bold
than
the
rest
who
made
a
plain
business
proposition
for
block
and
was
at
once
gratified
so
for
days
the
procession
continued
each
man
coming
singly
and
watching
whether
he
were
observed
half
the
council
had
sites
for
little
or
nothing
and
the
other
half
had
sites
at
rates
really
very
reasonable
and
all
the
while
to
the
mass
of
buyers
who
importuned
me
and
clamoured
about
me
i
said
that
only
very
limited
sales
could
be
made
and
those
of
leases
only
and
even
so
not
till
a
later
date
meanwhile
the
whole
town
council
was
converted
the
councillors
had
quite
lost
their
old
aversion
to
the
scheme
they
earmarked
enthusiastically
and
by
a
unanimous
vote
a
special
tax
for
the
laying
out
of
the
new
quarter
its
planting
with
trees
the
bringing
of
conduits
to
it
so
that
fountains
of
sweet
water
might
appear
in
private
houses
and
in
public
places
and
though
the
levy
was
no
light
one
it
was
paid
cheerfully
enough
by
all
the
councillors
who
were
now
curiously
proud
of
their
town
s
aggrandizement
even
among
the
mass
of
poor
ratepayers
there
were
no
executions
but
only
one
mild
case
of
torture
and
perhaps
a
dozen
bastinadoes
the
public
money
so
spent
was
very
well
worth
while
the
improvement
in
my
property
was
immense
and
when
a
fine
road
bordered
with
trees
was
laid
down
all
along
the
embankment
i
obtained
very
heavy
compensation
from
the
city
for
the
use
of
the
ground
and
the
cutting
off
of
my
approaches
to
the
river
i
on
my
side
was
not
niggardly
i
promised
gold
pieces
to
the
building
of
a
new
mosque
in
the
centre
of
the
place
on
condition
that
others
should
do
the
same
and
i
started
a
hall
of
public
recreation
the
price
of
admission
to
which
barely
repaid
the
expenses
of
upkeep
and
cleaning
taxes
heat
and
light
interest
on
debentures
which
i
had
myself
very
handsomely
subscribed
service
literature
and
secretarial
expenses
decoration
approaches
annual
depreciation
and
at
the
most
a
profit
of
six
to
eight
per
cent
i
also
provided
kitchens
where
the
poorer
citizens
could
purchase
food
at
very
little
more
than
its
value
these
were
of
great
service
to
the
police
who
had
here
a
central
place
whence
the
movements
of
my
less
fortunate
neighbours
could
be
traced
i
presented
also
public
fountains
with
solid
pewter
mugs
attached
to
the
stonework
by
strong
chains
lest
they
should
be
stolen
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
provide
free
of
all
cost
public
plans
of
the
new
quarter
showing
where
unleased
sites
still
remained
and
the
terms
on
which
they
might
be
acquired
i
made
it
a
rule
that
any
man
building
a
house
on
my
land
should
promise
to
give
it
up
to
me
for
nothing
after
twenty
years
but
as
many
people
were
too
poor
to
build
their
own
houses
i
established
a
fund
whence
they
could
borrow
the
money
at
the
ordinary
rates
of
interest
and
the
few
dues
fees
deductions
inevitable
to
such
transactions
in
every
way
did
i
develop
and
benefit
this
my
creation
of
a
new
town
i
had
my
reward
in
the
profound
respect
and
honour
paid
me
by
my
these
were
convened
by
the
council
at
an
appropriate
date
to
decide
what
recognition
should
be
made
of
my
services
they
finally
agreed
after
long
discussion
and
many
very
eloquent
discourses
upon
an
illuminated
parchment
which
was
presented
to
me
with
the
most
flattering
cheers
and
songs
upon
the
public
square
of
the
new
quarter
in
a
tent
of
purple
silk
specially
voted
for
the
occasion
and
later
claimed
as
a
perquisite
by
my
butler
i
replied
in
a
suitable
manner
to
the
acclamations
of
the
crowd
and
the
kindly
flattery
of
the
councillors
but
i
told
them
at
the
end
of
my
address
that
i
should
feel
ungrateful
indeed
if
upon
such
an
occasion
a
certain
humble
of
mine
were
overlooked
in
the
public
rejoicings
thereupon
i
extended
my
hand
to
the
enthusiast
that
young
engineer
of
parts
whom
i
had
so
fortunately
met
some
months
before
and
whom
i
had
arranged
should
be
near
the
steps
of
my
dais
at
the
required
moment
i
handed
him
up
i
smiled
benignantly
upon
him
as
he
blushed
with
happy
shame
and
pleasure
i
even
set
him
at
my
side
it
is
all
very
well
my
friends
said
i
as
i
concluded
my
little
speech
to
speak
as
you
do
of
the
foresight
and
business
acumen
organizing
power
and
the
rest
of
it
which
i
hope
justly
you
ascribe
to
me
when
you
tell
me
how
as
with
a
magic
wand
i
raised
all
this
new
city
from
the
marsh
which
preceded
it
but
what
would
such
gifts
be
had
they
not
been
aided
and
supplemented
by
talents
no
less
essential
such
as
those
which
we
all
admire
in
this
young
friend
at
my
right
he
it
is
who
has
performed
sometimes
in
a
very
literal
sense
the
his
has
been
the
hard
obscure
constant
labour
and
vigilance
without
which
my
own
more
conspicuous
efforts
would
have
been
in
vain
after
a
few
subdued
cheers
from
the
assembly
most
of
whom
had
never
heard
of
the
young
man
while
the
rest
had
forgotten
him
all
dispersed
and
i
was
free
to
seek
repose
in
my
own
new
and
sumptuous
house
i
am
glad
to
say
that
this
public
mention
of
my
worthy
young
colleague
was
not
all
i
did
for
him
as
the
agreed
salary
which
i
paid
him
by
our
contract
would
now
soon
expire
i
arranged
with
the
council
that
he
should
have
a
permanent
post
as
keeper
of
the
public
squares
at
a
wage
more
than
double
that
of
the
gardeners
and
be
granted
on
condition
of
good
behaviour
a
limited
pension
when
he
should
reach
his
seventieth
year
the
same
to
be
deducted
in
small
weekly
sums
from
his
pay
which
sums
as
he
was
not
yet
would
accumulate
to
much
more
than
was
necessary
and
leave
over
and
above
his
retiring
stipend
a
balance
for
anything
the
council
might
think
useful
he
was
also
lent
rent
free
a
small
house
with
a
nice
strip
of
front
garden
and
a
wooden
shed
at
the
side
his
duties
occupied
him
from
a
little
before
sunrise
to
the
pleasant
dusk
of
eve
with
an
hour
off
for
meals
and
a
fortnight
s
holiday
in
the
autumn
even
his
little
sister
was
not
forgotten
i
obtained
for
her
from
my
friends
among
the
religious
authorities
notably
the
mufti
who
was
most
strenuous
in
her
cause
the
post
of
head
cleaner
at
the
new
mosque
her
salary
there
was
necessarily
somewhat
smaller
than
her
brother
s
nor
had
she
any
holidays
while
her
hours
were
a
trifle
longer
but
on
the
other
hand
she
had
no
responsibilities
shortly
after
all
this
i
determined
to
sell
my
holding
in
this
new
property
and
to
betake
myself
to
other
mercantile
adventures
in
further
lands
i
had
been
in
this
place
more
than
a
year
i
had
made
very
good
friends
it
was
the
scene
of
a
success
greater
than
any
i
had
yet
experienced
nevertheless
i
felt
i
could
remain
there
no
longer
the
field
was
too
small
for
my
expanding
opportunities
there
was
nothing
left
to
take
i
announced
therefore
my
intentions
to
realize
and
allowed
a
certain
interval
for
a
public
decision
upon
the
purchase
of
my
land
and
leases
and
other
interests
a
curious
discussion
arose
one
party
composed
mainly
of
wealthy
but
intelligent
young
men
of
university
professors
and
of
were
insistent
that
the
town
council
should
buy
all
my
land
and
the
city
possess
it
for
the
future
for
it
was
obviously
wrong
they
agreed
that
improvements
in
land
and
houses
should
go
to
private
individuals
the
other
party
which
was
made
up
almost
entirely
of
builders
and
auctioneers
furiously
opposed
this
scheme
which
they
said
struck
at
the
roots
of
all
morals

life
stoutly
maintained
that
in
the
natural
scheme
of
providence
all
should
be
parcelled
out
among
the
highest
bidders
for
my
part
i
was
like
the
great
mass
of
the
taxpayers
indifferent
to
either
argument
all
that
interested
me
was
the
obvious
fact
that
in
the
competition
between
these
two
groups
on
the
council
the
value
of
my
property
necessarily
rose
at
last
the
first
party
prevailed
the
city
bought
me
out
really
a
most
interesting
social
experiment
and
i
received
the
sum
of
two
million
pieces
of
two
million
pieces
shouted
the
astonished
little
nephews
in
chorus
my
children
said
the
old
man
with
a
kindly
smile
to
you
coming
as
you
do
from
such
a
home
as
that
of
your
father
my
dear
brother
the
sum
must
seem
fabulous
though
to
me
it
sounds
moderate
enough
nevertheless
you
are
right
from
that
moment
i
count
the
great
change
in
my
life
and
the
confirmation
of
that
divine
mercy
which
had
always
watched
me
hitherto
as
i
now
know
but
which
henceforward
was
gloriously
present
in
every
act
of
my
life
before
the
day
when
i
first
saw
that
river
and
that
town
first
met
the
enthusiastic
young
engineer
first
formed
my
decisive
plan
i
had
been
a
man
subject
to
grave
anxieties
and
sufferings
now
precariously
affluent
now
starving
now
again
doubtfully
possessed
of
some
fleeting
money
then
came
the
marvellous
year
i
have
just
recited
since
then
i
have
enjoyed
the
results
of
so
much
persistence
and
skill
i
have
gathered
and
enjoyed
without
cease
the
fruits
of
great
and
increasing
oh
uncle
what
are
these
they
are
said
the
good
old
merchant
in
grave
and
reverent
tones
the
honour
of
neighbours
the
devotion
of
friends
the
admiration
of
all
mankind
a
permanent
and
what
is
more
important
than
them
all
the
strong
peace
of
the
the
intolerable
howl
of
the
muezzin
checked
his
nephews
reply
and
they
their
happy
eyes
shining
as
though
they
themselves
were
the
recipients
of
these
seven
figures
went
home
in
a
dream
of
gold

that
is

chapter
xiii
entitled
min
or
the
money
made
of
paper
on
the
appointed
day
of
the
next
week
the
little
boys
were
glad
to
observe
that
the
number
of
public
executions
had
fallen
so
far
below
the
average
that
their
uncle
s
entertainment
of
them
could
begin
quite
half
an
hour
before
the
usual
time
they
were
most
eager
to
discover
what
further
good
fortune
had
befallen
him
by
the
mercy
of
allah
the
amiable
old
man
opened
his
mouth
and
spoke
two
million
gold
pieces
is
a
respectable
sum
of
money
it
weighs
about
thirty
tons
yes
he
calculated
rapidly
on
his
bejewelled
fingers
about
thirty
tons
the
city
could
just
produce
it
after
scouring
the
country
for
miles
around
searching
all
the
more
modest
houses
and
melting
down
sundry
antique
lamps
wedding
rings
sacred
shrines
and
other
gewgaws
the
complete
withdrawal
of
so
much
metal
left
them
a
little
embarrassed
for
coin
in
everyday
affairs
but
really
that
was
not
my
business
i
packed
a
hundred
strong
iron
chests
with
the
bullion
reserving
a
few
thousands
in
a
leather
bag
set
them
in
carts
added
to
my
retinue
a
hundred
armed
men
marked
my
cases
plainly
in
large
white
letters
sand
consigned
to
the
sultan
and
had
all
made
ready
to
set
out
but
whither
until
a
man
s
wealth
has
grown
so
great
that
he
can
command
the
whole
state
he
is
always
in
some
peril
he
is
envied
and
a
target
for
vile
taxes
nay
for
confiscation
i
had
not
forgotten
the
dreadful
lesson
of
the
island
i
pondered
on
what
i
had
read
of
various
regions
and
had
rejected
each
in
turn
as
dangerous
when
i
heard
by
chance
a
man
saying
to
his
neighbour
with
whom
he
was
quarrelling
remember
this
is
not
the
country
of
dirak
where
there
is
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
as
you
may
well
believe
i
deeply
considered
these
random
words
and
within
an
hour
i
was
giving
an
excellent
meal
to
a
learned
man
who
taught
in
the
university
famous
for
his
knowledge
of
foreign
constitutions
i
spoke
of
the
franks
of
the
maghreb
of
rome
on
all
he
was
most
interesting
and
full
he
spoke
also
with
contempt
of
certain
wild
tribes
in
the
hills
who
have
a
strange
custom
of
choosing
a
retired
chief
annually
from
among
the
less
wealthy
members
under
the
barbarous
error
that
modest
means
conduce
to
honesty
and
sharpen
judgment
as
in
dirak
said
i
casually
in
dirak
he
exclaimed
astonished
why
who
can
have
told
you
such
tales
dirak
is
the
best
administered
the
most
flourishing
and
the
strongest
of
all
states
no
doubt
i
answered
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
why
said
he
in
sudden
anger
for
this
kind
of
learned
man
is
commonly
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
such
advantages
can
only
come
from
the
secure
rule
of
the
rich
a
fool
could
see
that
i
soothed
him
by
immediate
agreement
professed
my
admiration
at
his
vast
store
of
knowledge
and
pumped
him
all
that
afternoon
on
dirak
it
seemed
that
in
this
admirable
region
the
rich
rule
unquestioned
to
the
immense
profit
of
the
state
the
sultan
is
kept
on
a
strict
allowance
that
he
may
be
the
puppet
of
the
great
merchants
bankers
and
landholders
who
are
the
masters
of
the
commonwealth
and
him
the
middle
classes
are
allowed
a
livelihood
but
no
possessions
and
are
proud
of
their
small
incomes
which
usually
put
them
above
the
artizans
while
the
populace
are
content
to
swarm
in
hovels
underground
to
work
hard
all
day
and
all
the
year
round
for
a
little
food
and
to
revere
and
acclaim
the
rich
with
frenzied
cheers
upon
all
public
occasions
laws
and
proclamations
are
purchased
and
their
administration
is
in
the
hands
of
the
rich
of
whom
a
select
few
sit
upon
the
bench
and
condemn
a
fixed
number
of
the
populace
and
a
few
of
the
middle
classes
to
imprisonment
every
year
by
way
of
discipline
and
example
no
man
possessing
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
gold
pieces
worth
of
land
or
stock
can
be
punished
and
if
a
poor
man
tell
any
unpleasing
thing
of
such
a
one
he
is
beaten
till
he
admits
his
falsehood
or
if
he
prove
obstinate
slowly
starved
to
death
it
is
a
model
state
all
is
in
perfect
order
the
palaces
of
the
rulers
are
the
most
magnificent
in
the
world
all
public
office
is
faithfully
and
punctually
performed
it
is
the
envy
of
every
neighbour
the
pride
and
delight
of
every
citizen
however
mean
for
what
is
the
basis
of
the
whole
affair
every
man
in
dirak
is
esteemed
by
the
extent
of
his
possessions
alone
writing
and
music
and
work
in
metals
and
painted
tiles
are
esteemed
for
the
pretty
things
they
are
holiness
is
revered
indeed
but
confined
to
the
and
a
man
s
virtue
judgment
and
wit
are
rightly
gauged
by
his
property
my
many
adventures
had
somewhat
blunted
me
to
new
sensations
but
i
confess
my
dear
nephews
that
as
i
heard
this
tale
an
ecstasy
filled
my
soul
i
masked
my
emotions
and
simply
said
an
interesting
place
it
is
reached
by
a
plain
road
from
here
volunteered
the
learned
man
though
at
the
expense
of
a
long
journey
for
it
takes
a
caravan
quite
a
month
to
reach
the
capital
of
dirak
from
this
place
you
go
up
the
river
to
its
source
in
the
hills
a
week
s
travel
to
the
east
then
the
road
leads
you
over
a
pass
to
a
most
singular
cup
or
natural
cauldron
with
a
flat
highly
cultivated
floor
formerly
the
bed
of
a
lake
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
precipitous
limestone
cliffs
down
which
the
road
descends
by
artificial
cuttings
in
their
surface
this
strangely
isolated
spot
famous
for
its
gardens
and
simple
happiness
is
called
with
its
chief
village
skandir
and
strangers
are
there
most
hospitably
entertained
the
only
issue
thence
on
the
far
side
is
by
a
narrow
gorge
leading
through
the
mountains
beyond
which
again
are
vast
plains
of
grassy
lands
the
grazing
place
of
nomads
well
watered
and
provisioned
at
reasonable
distances
by
simple
but
well
furnished
villages
the
great
road
goes
through
all
these
still
eastward
these
prairies
get
drier
and
drier
as
they
rise
eastward
until
for
the
last
day
of
your
progress
at
the
wells
of
you
must
take
a
supply
of
water
for
the
next
hours
are
desert
you
reach
a
crest
of
the
slow
ascent
and
see
below
you
from
the
summit
of
the
road
some
half
a
day
s
going
across
the
plain
below
the
magnificent
capital
of
dirak
this
noble
city
whose
name
is
mawazan
was
founded
by
the
enormously
wealthy
yes
yes
i
interrupted
in
a
bored
tone
for
i
knew
all
i
wanted
to
know
some
day
i
must
go
there
a
very
amusing
journey
no
doubt
but
meanwhile
business
is
business
and
i
must
start
very
early
for
the
north
morning
to
look
after
some
purchases
i
have
made
in
grains
and
i
must
not
waste
any
more
of
your
the
learned
are
slow
to
take
a
hint
so
i
locked
my
arm
in
his
after
a
friendly
fashion
and
led
him
genially
to
the
door
where
he
tried
unsuccessfully
to
detain
me
for
further
remarks
on
yet
another
country
famous
for
its
enormous
bats
when
i
had
got
well
rid
of
him
it
was
already
dark
i
beat
up
my
quarters
without
delay
aligned
my
caravan
added
to
the
inscription
on
my
iron
treasure
chests
the
words
of
dirak
so
that
the
labels
now
ran
sand
for
the
sultan
of
dirak
marshalled
my
armed
troop
and
set
out
in
the
night
by
the
northern
road
but
long
before
daybreak
i
ordered
a
deflection
to
the
right
struck
the
great
road
along
the
river
and
so
proceeded
eastward
into
the
hills
it
was
as
the
learned
man
had
said
a
week
s
marching
to
the
sources
of
the
stream
led
to
a
pass
and
we
saw
below
us
at
evening
a
splendid
spectacle
that
small
oval
plain
of
skandir
all
girded
with
enormous
precipices
a
garden
of
fruit
trees
and
grain
with
great
prosperous
villages
in
its
midst
and
the
road
picking
its
way
by
cuttings
in
the
living
rock
down
to
the
valley
floor
and
thence
making
straight
for
the
main
town
we
reached
it
under
a
new
moon
in
the
second
hour
of
darkness
its
hospitality
had
not
been
exaggerated
the
good
peasants
received
us
with
every
kindness
and
i
was
lodged
in
a
most
comfortable
house
my
chests
and
grain
in
the
courtyard
and
my
numerous
retinue
under
lesser
roofs
around
next
day
as
luck
would
have
it
a
wretched
accident
befell
me
i
was
taking
the
air
at
the
door
of
my
house
preparatory
to
ordering
the
start
of
my
caravan
when
i
heard
the
ring
of
metal
on
the
flat
stones
of
the
street
a
child
running
past
had
dropped
a
small
silver
coin
i
marked
the
gleaming
spot
as
the
child
ran
on
unheeding
and
naturally
rushed
to
put
my
foot
on
it
before
it
should
be
noticed
by
any
other
intending
to
stoop
gracefully
at
my
leisure
and
pick
it
up
when
the
coast
was
clear
but
the
evil
one
who
is
ever
on
the
watch
to
undo
the
servants
of
the
most
high
caused
me
in
my
eagerness
to
slip
upon
a
greasy
piece
of
mud
and
i
fell
heavily
upon
the
stones
with
a
crash
my
leg
was
broken
in
the
agony
i
suffered
i
quite
forgot
the
silver
coin
the
void
still
aches
i
know
not
who
acquired
it
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
it
was
trampled
in
and
lost
to
the
world
at
any
rate
i
was
carried
to
my
couch
half
fainting
the
bone
was
set
with
excruciating
pain
and
i
lay
for
many
days
unable
to
rise
and
eating
my
heart
out
at
the
added
expense
of
my
large
company
which
was
dipping
deeply
into
my
store
of
loose
coin
my
main
treasure
stored
in
the
hundred
iron
boxes
i
dared
not
touch
for
the
chief
of
skandir
who
daily
visited
my
told
me
that
he
had
affixed
seals
to
the
sand
consigned
to
the
sultan
of
dirak
his
powerful
neighbour
and
taken
it
for
safe
keeping
into
his
castle
the
physician
assured
me
that
even
when
i
might
venture
out
on
crutches
it
would
be
fatal
in
view
of
certain
complications
which
had
arisen
if
i
were
to
think
of
travel
so
there
i
was
imprisoned
in
this
charming
valley
with
no
chance
of
commerce
my
spare
cash
dangerously
dwindling
and
a
most
expensive
three
weeks
journey
ahead
of
me
before
i
could
reach
my
beloved
dirak
what
was
i
to
do
my
dear
nephews
you
will
hear
many
harsh
things
said
of
those
who
prosper
as
i
have
done
they
are
vilified
through
a
base
envy
and
the
most
monstrous
tales
are
told
of
them
but
they
are
under
the
protection
of
heaven
and
that
guiding
power
supplements
their
humble
vows
none
can
deny
their
ready
response
to
inspiration
hear
what
i
did
first
i
purchased
out
of
my
remaining
free
gold
a
fine
house
that
happened
to
be
empty
next
i
had
painted
on
its
front
in
beautiful
and
varied
colours
mahmoud
s
next
i
told
the
chief
what
advantage
i
designed
for
him
and
his
during
my
enforced
stay
by
way
of
repaying
him
for
their
exceptional
kindness
next
i
sent
out
written
letters
to
all
the
wealthier
men
and
women
my
dear
nephews
saying
that
i
had
begun
operations
in
the
buying
and
selling
of
market
produce
and
that
any
capital
entrusted
to
me
would
earn
for
every
hundred
pieces
one
piece
a
week
payed
punctually
at
a
certain
hour
to
give
colour
to
my
scheme
i
sent
my
servant
amply
rewarded
to
watch
the
markets
in
the
valley
to
buy
up
fruit
and
grain
at
magnificent
prices
and
to
sell
elsewhere
as
best
he
could
never
mind
said
i
to
him
benevolently
at
what
loss
you
sell
i
desire
to
do
these
honest
people
a
the
volume
of
my
commerce
grew
at
a
heavy
charge
and
even
the
timid
thought
there
might
be
something
in
it
i
started
the
ball
rolling
by
getting
my
confidant
to
deposit
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
which
i
had
privily
furnished
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
duly
gave
him
back
one
hundred
and
one
in
the
presence
of
many
and
the
story
went
abroad
soon
the
chief
his
uncle
and
his
deposited
and
were
as
regularly
paid
one
per
cent
a
week
the
thing
began
to
buzz
but
i
watched
narrowly
my
dwindling
hoard
it
was
a
close
thing
when
i
had
progressed
in
this
fashion
for
what
i
considered
a
sufficient
time
i
judged
it
opportune
to
initiate
my
new
policy
of
an
expansion
of
exchange
through
instruments
of
dear
uncle
interrupted
the
eldest
nephew
yes
yes
said
the
merchant
impatiently
i
know
that
the
term
is
new
to
you
but
you
will
shortly
learn
its
meaning
when
i
had
occasion
to
buy
articles
for
my
private
consumption
or
to
make
an
exceptionally
heavy
purchase
of
my
wholesale
wares
i
would
frequently
affect
embarrassment
and
approaching
the
vendor
i
would
beg
him
to
accept
in
lieu
of
immediate
payment
in
cash
a
note
which
i
had
signed
promising
payment
in
gold
at
sight
for
said
i
to
him
in
the
rapid
turnover
of
my
business
it
is
but
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
for
me
to
be
again
in
possession
of
a
considerable
sum
of
ready
i
went
to
work
at
first
with
caution
i
never
by
any
chance
issued
a
single
note
for
more
than
ten
pieces
and
when
ever
any
one
of
these
notes
was
presented
for
payment
even
though
that
event
should
take
place
within
an
hour
of
my
issuing
it
i
promptly
honoured
it
from
the
reserve
of
metal
which
i
had
kept
back
for
the
furtherance
of
my
plan
i
was
careful
to
make
these
notes
identical
to
stamp
them
all
in
the
same
place
with
my
metal
seal
and
in
every
way
to
make
them
so
far
as
i
could
a
sort
of
currency
which
as
you
may
imagine
they
promptly
became
when
a
man
carrying
one
of
these
instruments
might
find
himself
called
upon
to
pay
at
some
distance
from
my
place
of
business
he
would
at
first
tentatively
offer
my
note
perhaps
at
a
small
discount
to
his
creditor
but
as
my
integrity
was
by
this
time
a
proverb
and
never
forget
dear
boys
that
integrity
is
the
soul
of
business
the
notes
were
more
and
more
readily
accepted
as
time
proceeded
the
convenience
of
carrying
such
paper
compared
with
the
heavy
weight
of
metal
they
might
represent
the
ease
of
negotiation
and
so
forth
rapidly
increased
their
circulation
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
able
to
calculate
with
assurance
what
the
experts
in
this
amiable
science
term
the
rate
of
circulation
which
my
notes
had
attained
i
found
that
roughly
speaking
for
every
five
pieces
to
which
i
had
thus
pledged
myself
upon
paper
two
were
sufficient
to
meet
the
claims
of
those
who
presented
them
at
any
one
moment
and
this
proportion
is
known
to
this
day
in
that
happy
valley
as
the
proportion
of
metallic
reserve
which
must
lie
behind
any
issue
of
notes
but
i
hear
that
since
my
departure
they
have
got
badly
muddled
oh
dear
dear
said
the
eldest
nephew
i
am
getting
muddled
myself
don
t
listen
to
him
said
his
brothers
in
chorus
yes
my
children
answered
the
old
man
vividly
it
is
indeed
a
difficult
subject
only
a
few
experts
really
understand
it
and
i
am
one
anyhow
you
all
see
that
i
could
now
make
new
money
as
i
chose
out
of
nothing
oh
yes
uncle
they
all
agreed
including
the
eldest
we
quite
see
that
well
said
their
revered
relative
in
a
subdued
tone
that
is
a
great
advantage
but
to
proceed
after
some
weeks
of
these
practices
i
found
myself
the
master
of
the
fruit
and
grain
markets
to
which
i
added
certain
adjuncts
naturally
suggested
by
it
such
as
catering
for
public
meals
the
erection
of
mosques
the
undertaking
of
marriages
funerals
and
divorces
the
display
of
fireworks
and
the
charging
of
fixed
fees
for
the
telling
of
fortunes
this
last
soon
became
a
very
flourishing
branch
of
my
business
i
employed
in
it
at
the
customary
wage
a
number
of
expert
soothsayers
and
these
with
the
rest
of
my
staff
amounted
to
perhaps
a
quarter
of
the
inhabitants
nor
were
they
the
least
contented
or
the
least
prosperous
of
the
population
in
a
word
my
dear
nephews
when
my
operations
were
concluded
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
pieces
of
gold
while
my
notes
which
were
everywhere
received
throughout
the
state
stood
for
more
a
simple
calculation
said
the
worthy
old
man
smiling
will
show
you
that
my
total
new
fortune
was
now
no
less
than
half
a
million
pieces
when
signs
of
economic
exhaustion
in
the
public
and
the
complete
healing
of
my
leg
reluctantly
decided
me
that
the
time
had
come
to
seek
fresh
fields
of
effort
and
other
undeveloped
as
the
merchant
now
puffed
at
his
pipe
in
silence
the
fifth
nephew
begged
leave
to
ask
him
two
questions
which
had
perplexed
his
youthful
mind
ask
away
my
little
fellow
said
his
uncle
kindly
and
i
will
attempt
to
explain
any
difficulty
you
have
in
simple
terms
suited
to
your
well
uncle
said
the
fifth
nephew
humbly
i
can
not
in
the
first
place
see
how
the
pieces
of
which
you
speak
and
which
as
you
say
were
represented
by
notes
alone
constituted
any
real
my
dear
little
chap
answered
his
uncle
leaning
forward
to
pat
him
upon
the
head
you
will
have
the
intelligence
to
perceive
that
wherever
such
a
note
existed
people
thought
of
it
as
ten
golden
pieces
did
they
not
answered
his
nephew
feeling
that
he
was
getting
cornered
very
well
continued
the
old
man
merrily
this
attitude
of
mind
being
common
to
the
whole
community
and
all
having
come
to
regard
these
pieces
of
paper
as
so
much
money
i
had
but
to
receive
them
in
payment
of
my
debts
and
then
to
buy
with
them
into
the
gold
of
others
thus
all
the
gold
entered
my
possession
eh
on
my
departure
the
outstanding
notes
were
presented
to
the
firm
i
hear
and
there
was
then
no
gold
to
meet
them
with
a
sad
state
of
affairs
many
clamoured
and
all
sorts
of
trouble
arose
but
by
that
time
i
was
far
the
little
chap
still
looked
puzzled
but
uncle
he
said
when
the
people
presented
the
notes
after
you
had
gone
they
may
have
thought
they
had
wealth
but
they
hadn
t
any
had
they
i
don
t
know
said
the
old
man
after
a
pause
it
is
a
most
difficult
point
in
the
discussion
of
currency
i
at
any
rate
had
been
bold
in
the
story
i
told
and
got
hold
of
their
but
the
wealth
wasn
t
uncle
persisted
the
little
boy
it
wasn
t
there
at
all
the
merchant
with
a
benign
air
replied
the
science
of
political
economy
is
abstruse
enough
for
the
most
aged
and
experienced
and
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
explain
to
you
at
length
so
intricate
a
point
let
it
suffice
for
you
that
so
far
as
was
concerned
the
wealth
there
it
was
there
in
fifty
large
leather
bags
you
had
i
think
he
added
in
a
severer
tone
a
second
question
to
propound
yes
said
his
nephew
with
a
slight
sigh
dear
uncle
it
was
this
why
under
such
favorable
circumstances
did
you
think
it
necessary
to
leave
so
early
seeing
that
your
new
trade
was
going
so
well
that
said
old
mahmoud
in
a
tone
of
relief
is
much
more
easy
to
answer
my
leg
was
healed
the
resources
of
skandir
were
limited
signs
were
apparent
that
the
worthy
populace
though
unable
to
unravel
the
precise
nature
of
their
entanglement
were
already
very
seriously
hampered
by
my
operations
though
i
was
able
to
prove
by
statistics
that
prosperity
had
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
though
the
chief
who
was
now
my
partner
kindly
printed
pamphlets
at
the
public
expense
to
prove
the
same
numbers
who
had
formerly
been
well
fed
were
now
reduced
to
a
few
handfuls
of
raw
grain
the
jails
were
crammed
much
of
the
land
was
going
out
of
cultivation
and
what
between
the
ignorant
passions
which
such
periods
of
transition
arouse
in
the
vulgar
and
the
inability
to
get
more
water
out
of
a
sponge
when
you
have
already
squeezed
it
thoroughly
dry
i
am
sure
that
i
was
right
in
the
determination
i
then
took
to
retire
from
this
field
of
operations
before
leaving
i
offered
my
business
for
sale
to
the
public
in
general
the
shares
i
am
glad
to
say
were
eagerly
taken
up
and
as
i
gave
a
preference
in
allotment
another
technical
term
to
those
who
paid
in
my
own
notes
i
recovered
all
of
these
save
an
insignificant
fraction
and
was
able
to
negotiate
them
again
for
gold
in
public
exchange
before
my
departure
meanwhile
the
unscrupulous
anxiety
of
the
chaotic
multitude
to
share
in
so
prosperous
a
commercial
undertaking
as
mine
had
been
permitted
me
to
ask
for
my
business
more
than
four
but
less
than
five
times
the
sum
which
i
would
myself
have
been
content
to
pay
for
it
i
loaded
more
camels
with
valuables
of
various
sorts
including
nearly
all
the
precious
metals
discoverable
in
the
state
i
purchased
a
whole
army
of
new
slaves
for
the
conduct
of
the
caravan
paying
for
them
in
new
notes
issued
upon
the
new
company
and
amid
the
plaudits
and
benedictions
of
a
vast
multitude
many
of
whom
i
regret
to
say
were
now
in
the
last
stages
of
destitution
i
regretfully
took
my
way
through
the
gorge
and
bade
farewell
to
the
simple
people
of
lovely
and
lonely
skandir
to
whom
i
owed
so
i
proceeded
from
the
people
of
the
valley
whom
i
had
introduced
to
banking
and
went
out
through
the
gorge
into
the
rising
prairies
beyond
the
mountains
for
at
least
four
days
march
beyond
the
valley
my
name
was
a
household
word
to
the
villages
through
which
i
passed
not
only
was
i
able
to
pay
for
all
goods
by
a
further
issue
of
notes
but
i
would
even
reward
any
special
considerations
shown
me
by
selling
to
the
grateful
inhabitants
for
cash
such
shares
in
my
old
firm
remaining
at
skandir
as
i
had
retained
to
amuse
me
in
my
travel
and
these
i
am
happy
to
say
went
rapidly
to
a
premium
these
shares
passed
at
gradually
lessening
prices
from
hand
to
hand
and
i
subsequently
learnt
that
in
a
few
months
they
had
become
unsaleable
those
who
suffered
in
the
last
purchases
had
only
themselves
to
blame
and
indeed
did
not
think
of
blaming
any
other
while
the
first
to
sell
at
a
high
price
still
hold
my
name
in
reverent
remembrance
when
i
had
proceeded
a
few
days
further
upon
my
travels
i
found
that
the
enlightenment
and
civilization
to
which
i
had
led
the
people
of
the
valley
was
gradually
dissipated
and
within
a
fortnight
i
discovered
myself
amid
the
very
brutish
nomad
population
who
absolutely
refused
to
take
paper
in
the
place
of
cash
even
when
this
form
of
payment
was
offered
by
my
own
body
servants
on
the
other
hand
the
precious
metals
were
so
scarce
amid
that
population
that
prices
were
extremely
low
and
i
was
able
at
a
very
small
outlay
in
gold
to
feed
the
whole
of
my
considerable
concourse
three
weeks
so
passed
in
these
monotonous
grass
lands
among
the
nomad
tribes
the
road
went
forward
to
the
east
rising
all
the
way
and
the
soil
grew
drier
and
drier
we
reached
the
wells
of
and
filled
our
skins
with
water
we
traversed
the
desert
belt
and
camped
near
the
summit
at
daybreak
we
came
to
the
escarpment
and
saw
the
wooded
slopes
falling
away
in
cascading
forests
at
our
feet
to
where
far
below
lay
the
splendid
plain
of
dirak
and
in
its
midst
far
off
and
dark
in
outline
against
the
burning
dawn
the
battlements
and
mosques
the
minarets
and
tapering
cypress
points
of
its
capital
misawan
what
joy
was
mine
to
fall
by
gentle
gradations
down
the
declivities
of
those
noble
woods
into
the
warm
fields
of
the
fortunate
state
at
every
hour
of
my
advance
new
delights
met
my
eye
great
country
houses
standing
in
magnificent
parks
with
carefully
tended
lawns
all
about
poor
men
who
saluted
low
as
i
passed
and
rich
men
here
and
there
who
glanced
a
moment
in
haughty
ease
fine
horses
passing
at
the
trot
mounted
by
subservient
grooms
and
continually
posts
bearing
such
notices
as
any
one
treading
on
this
lord
s
ground
will
be
no
one
insolent
word
and
to
jail
with
you
while
at
every
few
hundred
yards
an
armed
man
before
whom
the
poorer
people
cowered
would
frown
at
the
slaves
at
the
head
of
my
column
and
then
seeing
my
finely
mounted
guard
and
my
own
immutable
face
and
shining
garments
coming
up
behind
them
would
smile
and
bow
and
hint
at
a
few
small
coins
which
i
gave
in
truth
the
learned
man
had
not
deceived
me
this
land
of
dirak
was
a
paradise
i
rode
into
the
city
like
a
king
as
i
was
for
my
wealth
made
me
one
in
such
a
state
and
took
for
the
night
a
lodging
in
an
immense
building
which
called
itself
a
caravanserai
but
was
to
the
caravanserais
of
my
experience
as
the
sultan
s
palace
to
a
horse
there
in
an
apartment
of
alabaster
and
beaten
silver
i
eat
such
viands
as
i
had
not
thought
to
be
on
this
earth
while
slaves
trained
by
long
starvation
to
obedience
moved
noiselessly
in
and
out
or
played
soft
music
hidden
behind
a
carven
screen
oh
dirak
dirak
but
i
must
conclude
the
matter
was
not
long
with
my
gold
i
purchased
my
palace
in
the
midst
of
this
city
of
misawan
entertained
guests
who
asked
nothing
of
my
origin
bought
after
a
careful
survey
of
prices
the
excellent
post
of
chief
sweeper
to
his
majesty
which
carried
with
it
the
conduct
of
the
treasury
and
paid
for
a
few
laws
which
happened
to
suit
my
convenience
such
as
one
to
prevent
street
cries
and
another
for
the
strangling
of
the
poor
it
is
a
colour
of
hair
i
can
not
abide
from
time
to
time
i
paid
my
respects
to
that
puppet
called
the
sultan
and
bowed
low
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
court
i
had
no
occasion
to
hide
my
wealth
since
wealth
was
here
immune
and
the
criterion
of
honour
i
displayed
it
openly
i
boasted
of
its
amount
i
even
exaggerated
its
total
i
was
within
two
years
the
chief
man
in
the
state
yet
such
is
the
heart
of
man
i
was
not
wholly
satisfied
of
my
vast
fortune
not
a
hundredth
had
been
consumed
none
the
less
i
could
not
bear
to
let
it
lie
idle
i
was
determined
to
do
business
once
again
by
the
infinite
mercy
of
allah
the
opportunity
was
vouchsafed
there
lay
on
the
confines
of
dirak
another
state
called
har
very
different
in
this
the
sultan
was
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
community
and
a
tyrant
moreover
it
differed
from
dirak
in
this
important
particular
that
whereas
in
dirak
all
office
was
obtained
by
purchase
in
har
all
office
was
obtained
by
inheritance
so
that
between
the
two
lay
the
unending
and
violent
quarrel
between
trickery
and
pride
one
day
i
had
been
the
greatest
man
in
dirak
for
already
two
years
more
the
sultan
of
har
wickedly
insolently
and
not
having
the
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
demanded
satisfaction
of
the
sultan
of
dirak
for
a
loss
sustained
at
dice
by
his
grand
almoner
s
nephew
at
the
hands
of
that
noble
in
dirak
called
the
lord
persecutor
of
games
of
chance
which
are
in
dirak
strictly
forbidden
by
law
in
vain
did
the
sultan
of
dirak
implore
the
aid
of
his
nobles
they
assured
him
that
none
would
dare
attack
his
and
their
onmipotent
state
on
the
third
day
the
sultan
of
har
crossed
the
frontier
with
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
and
men
elephants
and
two
catapults
on
the
tenth
he
was
but
three
days
march
from
misawan
the
unfortunate
sultan
of
dirak
pressed
by
his
enemy
was
at
his
wits
end
for
the
ready
money
wherewith
to
conduct
the
war
he
had
already
so
severely
taxed
his
poor
that
they
were
upon
the
point
of
rebellion
while
the
rich
were
much
rather
prepared
to
make
terms
with
the
enemy
or
to
fly
than
to
support
his
whim
of
honour
patriotism
and
the
rest
musing
upon
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
and
recognizing
in
it
once
more
that
overshadowing
mercy
which
had
so
marvellously
aided
my
every
step
in
life
i
came
into
the
street
upon
a
horse
and
in
my
noblest
garments
i
was
careful
to
throw
largesse
to
the
crowd
at
an
expense
which
i
had
previously
noted
in
a
little
book
your
father
has
my
dear
nephews
trained
you
i
hope
to
keep
accounts
and
riding
up
to
the
palace
i
announced
to
the
guard
that
i
had
come
with
important
news
for
the
sultan
and
his
council
after
certain
formalities
which
cost
me
i
regret
to
say
no
less
than
fifteen
dinars
more
than
i
had
allowed
for
i
was
shown
into
the
presence
of
the
vizier
who
begged
me
to
despatch
my
business
hurriedly
as
the
sultan
was
expecting
at
any
moment
news
of
an
important
action
i
said
with
courtesy
and
firmness
that
my
time
was
my
own
that
perhaps
i
had
been
mistaken
in
the
news
conveyed
to
me
but
that
the
financial
operations
i
was
prepared
to
undertake
would
demand
a
certain
leisure
before
they
could
be
completed
at
the
words
financial
operations
the
vizier
s
manner
wholly
changed
he
was
profuse
in
apologies
admitting
a
little
shamefacedly
that
he
had
taken
me
for
a
soldier
a
priest
a
poet
or
something
of
that
sort
and
that
if
he
had
had
the
least
idea
of
my
intent
he
would
never
have
kept
me
waiting
as
he
had
unfortunately
done
he
proceeded
in
a
hurried
and
conventional
tone
to
discuss
the
weather
the
latest
scandal
and
other
matters
of
the
sort
until
at
my
own
time
i
proposed
to
introduce
the
important
subject
this
i
did
with
becoming
dignity
i
informed
him
with
the
utmost
reluctance
that
the
enemy
had
already
approached
me
for
financial
assistance
i
would
not
be
so
hypocritical
i
said
as
to
pretend
that
i
had
refused
them
or
indeed
that
i
had
any
sentimental
preference
for
one
side
or
the
other
as
i
thus
expressed
myself
the
vizier
constantly
and
gravely
nodded
as
who
should
say
that
he
esteemed
no
man
so
much
as
one
who
showed
himself
indifference
to
the
feelings
of
the
vulgar
i
next
asked
of
what
sum
the
government
was
in
immediate
need
and
on
hearing
that
it
amounted
to
about
a
quarter
of
my
total
capital
i
put
on
a
very
grave
look
and
said
that
i
feared
the
immediate
provision
of
so
large
an
amount
was
hardly
possible
in
view
of
the
poverty
and
embarrassment
of
his
unhappy
country
when
i
rose
as
though
to
leave
the
vizier
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
excitement
implored
me
to
reconsider
so
sudden
a
decision
he
was
prepared
he
swore
to
take
but
an
instalment
of
the
whole
ready
money
was
absolutely
necessary
and
if
with
my
profound
knowledge
of
finance
i
could
devise
some
way
of
escape
for
his
master
the
most
substantial
proofs
of
gratitude
would
be
afforded
me
upon
hearing
this
i
professed
to
be
plunged
into
profound
thought
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
ended
by
slowly
laying
before
him
as
an
original
and
masterly
plan
the
following
proposal
the
poor
he
had
admitted
were
taxed
beyond
the
limits
of
endurance
and
were
even
upon
the
point
of
revolt
the
rich
were
hiding
their
hoards
and
many
forms
of
portable
wealth
were
leaving
the
country
let
him
abandon
these
uncouth
and
rapacious
methods
of
obtaining
revenue
and
ask
the
wealthier
of
the
loving
subjects
of
the
sovereign
to
him
at
interest
what
they
would
certainly
refuse
to
pay
him
outright
in
this
way
a
smaller
annual
sum
by
far
than
was
now
raised
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
war
would
suffice
to
meet
the
obligations
of
the
government
the
capital
so
raised
would
be
spent
upon
the
campaign
the
charge
imposed
upon
the
people
would
it
is
true
be
perpetual
but
it
would
be
so
much
smaller
than
the
existing
taxation
as
to
be
everywhere
welcomed
the
vizier
sadly
responded
that
though
he
would
be
very
happy
to
undertake
such
a
course
he
feared
that
the
wealthy
inhabitants
would
never
lend
knowing
as
they
did
the
embarrassment
of
the
government
save
upon
ruinous
terms
i
had
been
waiting
for
this
confession
and
i
at
once
suggested
that
i
could
act
as
i
would
said
i
stand
guarantor
my
great
wealth
would
at
once
restore
opinion
the
loan
would
certainly
be
taken
up
and
i
should
only
make
the
nominal
charge
of
five
gold
pieces
every
year
for
each
hundred
i
had
thus
guaranteed
the
vizier
was
so
astounded
at
my
generosity
that
he
almost
fell
backward
but
recovering
himself
he
poured
forth
the
most
extravagant
thanks
which
were
hardly
marred
by
the
look
i
detected
in
his
eye
a
look
certainly
betraying
the
belief
that
such
an
offer
from
a
commercial
man
could
hardly
be
made
in
good
faith
to
reassure
him
i
adopted
what
is
known
in
the
financial
world
as
the
seventh
or
frankly
simple
tone
i
told
him
without
reserve
the
total
of
my
wealth
which
i
put
at
a
fifth
of
its
real
amount
and
promised
to
bring
it
in
cash
to
offices
which
he
should
permit
me
to
establish
in
the
city
entering
the
next
day
with
a
million
pieces
of
gold
charged
upon
a
train
of
very
heavily
laden
camels
i
set
up
my
bank
in
the
most
crowded
portion
of
the
bazaar
published
news
of
my
intention
to
support
the
government
inviting
the
public
inspection
of
the
metal
so
lent
and
at
the
same
time
proposing
that
any
who
desired
regular
interest
of
four
pieces
guaranteed
by
myself
annually
upon
every
hundred
should
come
forward
to
take
the
loan
off
my
hands
the
hoards
of
gold
still
remaining
in
the
country
reappeared
as
though
by
magic
so
much
more
delightful
is
it
to
lend
voluntarily
at
interest
than
to
pay
away
under
torture
for
ever
and
at
last
there
applied
at
my
office
for
the
favour
of
extending
a
loan
ten
times
as
many
citizens
as
the
situation
required
my
terms
with
the
government
were
simple
and
i
am
sure
moderate
all
that
i
asked
was
that
the
tax
collectors
should
in
future
pay
their
receipts
into
my
chest
from
which
i
pledged
myself
to
hand
over
to
the
government
whatever
surplus
there
might
be
after
i
had
paid
to
the
lenders
their
annual
interest
four
pieces
and
kept
for
myself
a
fifth
piece
which
formed
my
tiny
and
not
unearned
commission
in
this
way
i
rapidly
repaid
myself
and
also
took
one
piece
on
every
hundred
had
subscribed
the
learned
men
of
the
place
who
had
never
before
imagined
so
simple
and
practical
a
plan
treated
me
with
almost
supernatural
reverence
i
was
consulted
upon
every
operation
of
war
my
guarantee
was
eagerly
sought
for
in
other
financial
ventures
and
i
was
able
i
am
glad
to
say
to
secure
other
commissions
without
touching
a
penny
of
my
treasure
i
had
but
to
hold
it
forth
as
a
proof
of
good
faith
the
enemy
was
repelled
but
victory
was
not
won
the
war
dragged
on
for
a
year
and
there
was
no
decision
gold
grew
scarce
and
again
the
government
was
in
despair
i
easily
relieved
them
write
i
said
promises
on
paper
to
be
repaid
in
they
did
as
i
advised
paying
me
at
my
request
a
trifle
of
half
a
million
for
the
advice
i
handled
the
affair
on
a
merely
nominal
profit
i
punctually
met
for
another
year
every
note
that
was
paid
in
but
too
many
were
presented
for
the
war
seemed
unending
and
entered
a
third
year
then
did
i
conceive
yet
another
stupendous
thing
bid
them
said
i
to
the
sultan
take
the
notes
as
money
cease
to
repay
write
not
i
will
on
delivery
of
this
paper
pay
a
piece
of
gold
but
this
a
piece
of
he
did
as
i
told
him
the
next
day
the
vizier
came
to
me
with
the
story
of
an
insolent
fellow
to
whom
fifty
such
notes
had
been
offered
as
payment
for
a
camel
for
the
war
and
who
had
sent
back
not
a
camel
but
another
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
written
this
a
cut
off
his
head
said
i
it
was
done
and
the
warning
sufficed
the
paper
was
taken
and
the
war
proceeded
it
was
i
that
prepared
the
notes
and
on
each
batch
i
exacted
my
necessary
commission
my
little
commission
my
due
it
was
not
in
my
nature
dear
nephews
however
in
those
days
of
hard
and
honest
work
to
lie
idle
when
i
had
put
the
sultan
on
his
legs
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
s
was
also
very
probably
in
similar
straits
i
therefore
visited
the
enemy
s
capital
by
a
roundabout
route
and
concluded
with
the
vizier
of
that
opulent
but
agitated
state
a
similar
bargain
the
war
thus
replenished
at
its
sources
raged
with
redoubled
ardour
for
ten
more
years
and
but
uncle
said
the
fourth
nephew
who
was
an
athlete
and
somewhat
stupid
and
who
had
heard
of
this
double
negotiation
with
round
eyes
surely
they
must
have
both
been
very
angry
with
you
the
excellent
mahmoud
raised
his
left
hand
in
protest
dear
lad
cried
he
how
little
you
know
the
world
angry
why
each
regarded
me
in
the
first
place
as
a
genius
whose
ways
it
was
impossible
to
unravel
in
the
second
place
as
a
public
necessity
in
the
third
as
a
benefactor
arrived
at
a
miraculous
moment
and
as
for
the
fact
that
i
was
aiding
both
sides
i
have
only
to
tell
you
that
among
the
people
of
that
region
it
is
thought
the
proper
part
of
all
financiers
to
act
in
this
fashion
i
should
have
been
treated
with
deserved
contempt
had
i
betrayed
any
scruples
upon
so
simple
a
matter
nay
i
am
sure
that
either
party
reposed
the
greater
trust
in
me
from
the
fact
that
my
operations
were
thus
universal
but
to
proceed
the
mercy
of
allah
was
never
more
apparent
in
my
career
than
in
the
way
these
two
sultans
and
their
subjects
fought
like
raging
dogs
upon
the
proceeds
of
those
loans
which
the
wealthy
citizens
upon
either
side
had
provided
and
upon
the
mountains
of
paper
which
i
spent
half
the
day
in
signing
these
loans
increased
ten
twenty
it
was
always
i
that
guaranteed
them
i
had
not
to
risk
or
expend
one
miserable
dinar
of
my
horde
and
yet
yearly
my
commission
came
rolling
in
in
larger
and
larger
amounts
until
at
last
the
arduous
but
glorious
campaigns
were
terminated
in
the
total
exhaustion
of
one
of
the
two
combatants
at
this
distance
of
time
i
forget
which
and
his
territory
and
capital
were
laid
under
an
enormous
indemnity
which
i
again
financed
without
the
tedium
of
myself
producing
any
actual
metal
of
my
own
as
the
beaten
state
might
have
repudiated
its
obligations
i
was
careful
to
meet
the
patriotic
clamours
of
the
victorious
populace
and
to
see
that
the
territory
of
the
vanquished
should
be
annexed
you
appreciate
the
situation
my
dear
fellow
said
the
aged
mahmoud
conversationally
to
his
eldest
nephew
i
think
so
uncle
said
the
lad
doubtfully
screwing
up
his
face
it
is
quite
simple
said
the
wealthy
old
man
clearing
his
throat
the
peoples
of
both
states
now
happily
united
were
taxed
to
their
utmost
capacity
the
one
strong
and
united
government
guaranteed
a
regular
revenue
a
proportion
of
this
revenue
was
annually
distributed
as
a
income
to
the
wealthy
few
who
had
subscribed
my
loans
another
portion
amounting
by
this
time
annually
to
considerably
more
than
my
original
capital
was
retained
in
my
coffers
and
the
mechanism
of
this
was
the
more
simple
from
the
fact
that
all
the
public
revenues
passed
through
my
own
hands
as
state
banker
before
any
surplus
was
handed
over
to
the
the
old
man
ceased
his
benevolent
lips
were
murmuring
a
prayer
at
this
moment
the
hideous
call
for
prayer
from
the
minaret
would
no
longer
be
denied
and
the
seven
boys
plunged
in
profound
thought
retired
slowly
to
the
home
of
the
physician
their
father
they
found
him
tired
out
with
having
sat
up
all
night
at
the
of
a
howling
dervish
who
in
his
last
dying
whisper
and
that
a
hoarse
one
had
confessed
his
total
inability
to
pay
the
customary
fee

chapter

entitled

or
the
peace
of
the
soul
we
had
arrived
said
the
excellent
old
merchant
to
his
nephews
when
they
were
once
more
seated
round
him
for
the
last
of
these
entertaining
relations
we
had
arrived
my
dear
boys
in
the
story
of
my
life
at
my
considerable
increase
of
fortune
through
the
financial
aid
i
had
given
to
two
states
one
of
which
after
a
long
and
exhaustive
war
had
conquered
and
annexed
the
other
my
position
if
you
recollect
at
the
close
of
this
adventure
was
that
without
having
spent
any
money
of
my
own
i
was
now
receiving
permanently
and
for
ever
a
very
large
yearly
revenue
set
aside
from
the
taxes
of
both
states
not
a
man
reaped
or
dug
or
carried
heavy
water
jars
under
the
hot
sun
not
a
man
groomed
a
horse
or
bent
under
the
weight
of
a
pack
not
a
man
added
brick
to
brick
or
mixed
mortar
not
a
man
did
any
useful
act
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other
but
some
part
of
his
toil
was
done
for
me
and
this
state
of
affairs
was
as
i
have
said
as
fixed
and
permanent
as
human
things
can
be
i
was
therefore
what
even
financiers
call
one
way
with
another
i
was
now
worth
perhaps
twenty
million
pieces
of
gold
but
that
is
but
guess
work
it
may
have
been
you
might
imagine
that
i
would
have
been
content
from
that
day
onwards
to
repose
in
my
opulence
i
might
well
have
been
tempted
to
do
so
for
to
that
opulence
was
added
a
singular
and
fervid
popularity
i
was
alluded
to
in
public
and
private
as
the
man
who
had
saved
the
state
by
his
financial
genius
during
the
great
war
even
the
conquered
remembered
me
gratefully
for
the
aid
i
had
extended
to
them
in
their
need
while
since
i
could
not
satisfy
my
personal
desires
without
at
least
feeding
a
great
host
of
dancers
bearers
artists
my
kindness
in
affording
employment
was
universally
recognized
moreover
since
among
these
people
wealth
is
a
test
of
greatness
i
was
admitted
to
their
senate
without
the
usual
formality
of
a
cash
payment
the
world
was
now
indeed
at
my
feet
but
you
must
know
continued
mahmoud
with
something
of
sadness
in
his
voice
you
must
know
my
dear
innocent
lads
that
wealth
will
not
stop
still
the
mere
administration
of
a
great
fortune
tends
to
increase
it
and
when
one
has
for
years
found
one
s
occupation
in
the
accumulation
of
money
it
is
difficult
in
middle
age
to
abandon
the
rooted
habit
therefore
though
i
now
had
all
that
life
could
give
me
i
proceeded
henceforward
for
many
years
to
increase
that
substance
with
which
the
mercy
of
allah
had
provided
me
and
i
discovered
at
the
outset
of
this
new
career
that
to
be
the
financier
i
had
become
and
to
have
behind
me
the
resources
which
i
now
possessed
made
my
further
successes
a
matter
not
of
hazard
but
of
certitude
shall
i
briefly
tell
you
the
various
ways
in
which
my
efforts
proceeded
pray
pray
do
so
said
his
little
nephews
with
sparkling
eyes
each
imagining
himself
in
the
dazzling
position
of
his
wealthy
relative
very
well
sighed
mahmond
it
will
be
of
little
use
to
any
of
you
but
if
it
does
no
more
than
confirm
you
in
your
religion
what
i
have
to
tell
you
will
not
have
been
told
in
the
merchant
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
began
the
category
of
his
financial
proceedings
neighbouring
states
which
had
heard
of
the
powerful
new
methods
i
had
introduced
would
approach
me
from
time
to
time
for
financial
assistance
to
these
i
made
the
same
invariable
reply
that
upon
certain
terms
which
i
myself
would
fix
i
was
content
to
float
their
loans
that
is
the
rich
men
of
their
country
or
of
any
other
should
pay
into
my
office
the
sums
they
were
prepared
to
lend
to
such
a
state
and
i
would
pay
back
a
part
but
not
the
whole
of
the
amount
so
accumulated
to
the
state
in
question
the
enormous
service
i
rendered
by
allowing
my
office
to
be
used
for
this
transaction
was
everywhere
recognized
and
by
such
operations
my
fortunes
proceeded
to
grow
it
was
at
this
moment
in
my
career
that
i
married
my
wife
your
dear
aunt
who
generally
resides
as
you
know
in
that
one
of
my
country
palaces
called
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
some
four
days
journey
from
here
it
is
a
delightful
spot
which
i
remember
well
though
i
have
not
seen
it
for
years
some
day
perhaps
i
will
visit
it
again
but
not
to
sleep
your
dear
aunt
was
and
is
my
boys
a
most
remarkable
woman
fit
to
compete
with
the
master
spirits
of
our
time
yea
even
with
my
own
her
birth
i
need
not
conceal
it
was
humble
she
was
but
a
chance
hireling
in
my
offices
with
the
duty
of
sorting
my
papers
and
keeping
indices
of
the
same
such
was
her
interest
in
affairs
that
she
was
at
the
pains
to
take
copies
and
tracings
of
many
particularly
private
and
important
passages
with
her
own
hand
and
keep
these
by
her
in
a
private
place
i
was
struck
beyond
measure
at
such
industry
and
preoccupation
with
business
on
the
part
of
a
woman
and
one
so
poor
i
conceived
an
ardent
desire
to
possess
these
specimens
of
her
skill
but
to
my
astonishment
and
at
first
confusion
she
humbly
replied
that
a
profound
though
secret
affection
which
she
had
conceived
for
me
forbade
her
to
part
with
these
precious
souvenirs
of
myself
i
was
so
absorbed
in
their
pursuit
that
rather
than
lose
them
i
married
this
queen
of
finance
recognizing
in
her
an
equal
genius
with
my
own
our
wedding
was
of
the
simplest
i
took
comfort
from
the
consideration
that
it
proved
me
superior
to
all
the
nobles
of
the
court
and
indifferent
to
an
alliance
with
their
families
immediately
after
the
wedding
my
wife
your
dear
aunt
asked
me
for
money
wherewith
to
travel
a
request
i
readily
granted
she
traversed
for
her
pleasure
i
knew
not
what
foreign
lands
always
and
gladly
furnished
with
the
wherewithal
from
my
cash
box
but
on
my
returning
later
to
bagdad
my
native
place
she
unexpectedly
appeared
at
my
door
and
i
was
happy
to
build
for
her
that
country
palace
of
to
the
charm
of
which
i
have
alluded
unfortunately
its
air
suits
me
ill
while
she
your
dear
aunt
suffocates
in
the
atmosphere
of
bagdad
it
is
often
thus
in
old
age
mahmoud
mused
and
continued
but
let
us
return
to
my
further
activities
in
that
far
land
i
next
designed
a
scheme
whereby
every
form
of
human
misfortune
fire
disease
paralysis
madness
and
the
rest
might
be
alleviated
to
the
sufferer
by
the
payment
of
regular
sums
of
money
upon
the
advent
of
the
disaster
weekly
sums
for
his
support
if
he
were
rendered
infirm
or
ill
a
lump
sum
to
replace
whatever
he
might
have
totally
lost
and
so
forth
a
short
and
easy
survey
of
the
average
number
of
times
in
which
such
accidents
took
place
permitted
me
to
establish
my
system
i
charged
for
dinars
worth
of
such
insurance
dinars
and
my
benevolence
was
praised
even
more
highly
than
my
ingenuity
men
flocked
in
thousands
and
at
last
in
millions
to
secure
themselves
from
the
uncertainty
of
human
life
by
giving
me
of
their
free
will
more
money
in
regular
payments
than
i
could
by
any
accident
be
compelled
to
pay
out
to
any
one
of
them
upon
his
reaching
old
age
his
suffering
from
fire
or
his
contraction
of
an
illness
nay
death
itself
at
last
entered
into
this
design
and
having
found
that
young
men
just
of
age
live
upon
the
average
for
forty
years
i
asked
them
to
pay
for
their
heirs
annual
sums
calculated
as
though
that
period
were
thirty
and
thus
i
continued
to
accumulate
wealth
from
a
perennial
but
why
began
one
of
his
nephews
excitedly
why
asked
his
uncle
severely
why
said
the
poor
lad
a
little
abashed
by
his
uncle
s
tone
why
did
they
pay
you
more
for
a
thing
than
it
was
worth
mahmoud
stroked
his
long
white
beard
and
looked
up
sideways
towards
the
highly
decorated
vault
of
the
gorgeous
apartment
he
remained
thus
plunged
in
thought
for
perhaps
thirty
seconds
and
when
he
broke
the
silence
it
was
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
but
no
matter
he
added
hurriedly
i
paid
for
a
law
which
compelled
all
slaves
to
insure
and
so
was
certain
of
a
fixed
revenue
in
this
kind
and
i
had
many
other
resources
he
continued
cheerily
if
those
who
had
made
many
such
regular
payments
to
me
to
insure
against
death
old
age
disease
and
the
rest
happened
to
fall
into
an
embarrassed
condition
and
to
need
a
loan
i
was
always
ready
to
advance
them
their
own
money
again
at
interest
or
did
i
ever
find
them
unwilling
to
subscribe
the
bond
further
i
urged
and
tempted
many
to
fall
into
arrears
and
so
possessed
myself
of
all
they
had
paid
in
the
vast
sums
paid
to
me
in
these
various
fashions
were
sometimes
too
great
for
investment
within
the
state
and
i
had
to
look
further
afield
but
here
again
by
the
mercy
of
allah
suggestions
of
the
most
lucrative
sort
perpetually
occurred
to
my
religious
soul
not
infrequently
i
would
lay
out
a
million
or
two
in
the
purchase
of
a
great
estate
situated
at
some
distance
which
when
i
had
acquired
it
i
would
declare
to
be
packed
with
gold
silver
diamonds
copper
salt
and
china
clay
beneath
the
earth
and
on
its
surface
loaded
with
red
pepper
and
other
most
precious
fruits
i
have
no
doubt
these
estates
were
often
of
a
promising
nature
though
travellers
have
assured
me
that
some
were
mere
desert
in
one
case
to
my
certain
knowledge
the
estate
did
not
even
exist
but
it
really
mattered
little
whether
i
spoke
truly
or
falsely
with
regard
to
such
ventures
for
my
method
of
dealing
with
them
made
them
whether
they
were
of
trifling
value
or
of
more
invariably
profitable
to
many
besides
myself
and
a
blessing
to
the
whole
but
uncle
interjected
another
nephew
how
could
that
be
you
will
easily
see
said
mahmoud
with
a
pitying
smile
when
you
hear
the
sequel
i
was
not
so
selfish
as
to
retain
these
properties
in
my
own
hands
i
would
offer
them
to
the
public
for
sale
and
being
in
a
position
to
pay
many
poets
scribes
and
public
story
tellers
who
should
make
general
the
praises
of
the
estates
in
question
an
active
competition
among
many
thousands
would
arise
to
become
part
purchasers
in
the
presence
of
this
competition
the
price
of
a
share
or
part
property
would
rise
those
who
had
bought
early
would
sell
later
to
others
at
a
profit
and
these
to
others
again
at
a
further
profit
still
an
active
buying
and
selling
of
these
part
properties
in
my
ventures
thus
became
a
fixed
habit
in
the
intelligent
people
of
the
place
and
those
who
were
left
ultimately
the
possessors
of
the
actual
estates
in
question
whether
real
or
imaginary
were
only
the
more
foolish
and
ignorant
of
the
population
their
agonized
denouncement
of
my
judgment
as
they
wandered
from
one
to
another
attempting
to
dispose
of
their
bad
bargains
was
of
course
treated
with
contempt
by
the
run
of
able
men
who
remembered
the
profits
of
the
share
market
at
the
inception
of
the
business
on
this
account
it
was
possible
for
me
to
continue
indefinitely
to
present
for
sale
to
the
public
every
species
of
venture
which
i
might
feel
inclined
to
put
before
them
the
intelligent
and
successful
were
ever
my
applauders
the
unfortunate
and
despised
alone
decried
me
and
these
were
on
account
of
my
operations
so
poor
and
therefore
of
so
little
significance
in
the
state
that
i
rarely
thought
it
worth
while
to
pay
the
authorities
for
their
imprisonment
or
death
within
ten
years
there
were
no
bounds
to
my
possessions
it
was
currently
said
that
i
myself
had
no
conception
of
their
magnitude
and
i
admit
this
was
true
from
time
to
time
i
would
pay
enormous
sums
to
endow
a
place
of
learning
to
benefit
the
ministers
of
my
own
religion
and
its
antagonists
or
to
propagate
by
means
of
an
army
of
public
criers
some
insignificant
opinion
peculiar
to
myself
or
my
wife
your
dear
aunt
whose
strong
views
upon
the
wearing
of
green
turbans
by
hadjis
and
the
illumination
of
the
koran
in
red
ink
are
doubtless
familiar
to
you
i
would
also
put
up
vast
buildings
to
house
the
aged
indigent
whose
name
began
with
an
a
or
others
wherein
could
be
set
to
useful
labour
the
aged
indigent
who
were
blind
of
one
eye
i
erected
endowed
and
staffed
an
immense
establishment
standing
in
its
own
grounds
wherein
was
taught
and
proved
the
true
doctrine
that
gold
and
silver
are
but
dross
and
that
learning
is
the
sole
good
and
yet
others
in
which
it
was
proved
with
equal
certitude
that
learning
like
mundane
things
is
dust
and
only
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
sacred
text
worth
having
but
the
professors
of
this
last
science
demanded
double
pay
urging
with
sense
i
thought
that
any
fool
could
talk
at
large
but
that
it
took
hard
work
to
study
manuscripts
that
only
half
a
dozen
men
knew
the
documents
exhaustively
and
that
if
they
were
they
would
stand
aside
and
wreck
the
enterprise
with
their
savage
critiques
meanwhile
i
devised
in
my
leisure
time
an
amusing
instrument
of
gain
called
the
cream
i
paid
my
wretched
sultan
and
his
court
for
a
law
to
be
imposed
compelling
all
men
under
pain
of
torture
to
reveal
their
revenues
from
farming
or
any
other
reputable
trade
but
taking
no
account
of
gambling
and
juggling
as
being
unimportant
and
too
difficult
to
follow
i
next
paid
another
sum
to
the
writers
and
spouters
and
other
starvelings
to
denounce
all
who
objected
for
less
than
double
this
sum
i
brought
a
new
law
which
swept
away
all
the
surplus
of
the
better
farmers
and
other
reputable
men
into
a
general
fund
and
paid
out
their
cruel
loss
partly
in
little
doles
to
the
very
poor
but
partly
also
for
fair
play
s
a
jewel
in
added
stipends
to
the
very
rich
with
posts
at
court
the
lord
high
conjurer
i
especially
favoured
thus
did
i
establish
a
firm
friendship
with
the
masses
and
with
their
governors
and
i
am
glad
to
say
destroyed
the
middle
sort
who
are
a
very
dull
greasy
humdrum
lot
at
the
best
rightly
detested
by
their
betters
as
apes
and
by
their
inferiors
as
immediate
masters
and
on
all
this
i
took
my
little
commission
my
children
my
children
ended
the
old
man
his
eyes
now
full
of
frigid
tears
i
had
attained
the
summit
of
human
life
i
had
all
and
there
descended
upon
me
what
wealth
supreme
wealth
alone
can
give
the
strong
peace
of
the
his
tears
now
flowed
freely
and
his
nephews
were
touched
beyond
measure
to
see
such
emotion
in
one
so
great
it
is
he
continued
with
difficulty
from
his
rising
emotion
it
is
wealth
and
wealth
alone
wealth
superior
to
all
surrounding
wealth
that
can
procure
for
man
that
equal
vision
of
the
world
that
immense
tolerance
of
evil
that
unfailing
hope
for
the
morrow
and
that
profound
content
which
furnish
for
the
heart
of
man
its
resting
here
the
millionaire
frankly
broke
down
he
covered
his
face
in
his
hands
and
his
sobs
were
echoed
by
those
of
his
respectful
nephews
with
the
exception
of
the
third
with
whom
they
degenerated
into
hiccoughs
mahmoud
raised
his
strong
old
features
dried
his
eyes
and
asked
them
since
his
tale
was
now
done
whether
they
had
any
questions
to
ask
after
a
long
interval
the
eldest
spoke
oh
my
revered
uncle
said
he
in
an
awestruck
voice
if
i
may
make
so
bold
why
did
you
leave
this
place
of
your
power
and
return
to
bagdad
his
uncle
was
silent
for
a
space
and
then
replied
in
slow
and
measured
words
it
was
in
this
wise
a
sort
of
moral
distemper
a
mysterious
inward
plague
struck
the
people
among
whom
i
dwelt
the
poor
in
spite
of
their
increased
doles
seemed
to
grow
mysteriously
disinclined
for
work
the
rich
and
especially
those
in
power
fell
i
know
not
why
into
habits
of
the
middle
class
whom
i
had
so
justly
destroyed
were
filled
in
their
ruin
with
a
vile
spite
and
rancour
as
they
still
commanded
some
remaining
power
of
expression
by
pen
and
voice
they
added
to
the
great
ill
ease
one
evening
an
awful
thing
happened
a
large
pebble
one
may
almost
call
it
a
stone
was
flung
through
the
open
lattice
of
my
banqueting
room
and
narrowly
missed
the
deputy
head
controller
who
stood
behind
the
couch
where
i
reclined
at
the
head
of
my
guests
it
was
a
warning
from
heaven
next
day
i
began
with
infinite
precautions
to
realize
i
knew
that
for
some
hidden
reason
the
country
was
poisoned
parcel
by
parcel
lot
by
lot
i
disposed
of
my
lands
my
shares
in
enterprises
my
documents
of
mortgage
and
loan
by
messengers
i
transferred
this
wealth
to
purchases
in
the
plains
about
bagdad
my
native
place
on
the
tigris
bonds
upon
the
houses
of
mosul
and
mills
on
the
farm
colonies
of
the
persian
hills
in
promises
to
pay
signed
by
the
caliph
and
in
the
admitted
obligations
of
the
lords
of
bosra
and
the
euphrates
an
inner
voice
said
to
me
mahmoud
you
have
achieved
the
peace
of
the
soul
do
not
risk
it
longer
when
all
my
vast
fortune
was
so
transferred
to
mesopotamia
i
went
down
by
a
month
s
journey
to
the
took
ship
and
sailed
up
the
gulf
for
the
home
of
my
childhood
i
was
but
just
in
time
within
a
week
of
my
departure
an
insolent
message
was
received
by
the
sultan
of
my
former
habitation
from
the
robber
king
of
the
hills
demanding
tribute
in
vain
did
the
unfortunate
man
plead
his
progress
in
the
arts
his
magnificent
national
debt
the
high
wages
of
his
artisans
and
their
happy
leisure
the
refinement
and
luxury
of
his
nobles
not
even
their
hot
baths
and
their
change
of
clothes
three
times
a
day
could
save
them
the
cruel
barbarian
conqueror
the
whole
place
sacked
the
capital
confiscated
the
land
annulled
all
deeds
imposed
a
fearful
tribute
and
had
i
left
one
copper
coin
in
the
country
which
happily
i
had
not
it
would
have
been
lost
to
me
for
ever
but
by
the
time
these
dreadful
things
were
taking
place
i
was
safe
here
in
bagdad
it
was
about
the
time
the
eldest
of
you
was
born
i
purchased
this
site
built
the
palace
where
you
do
me
the
honour
of
attending
me
and
also
that
of
for
my
wife
your
dear
aunt
four
days
away
and
have
now
lived
serenely
into
old
age
praising
and
blessing
god
my
dear
nephews
i
have
no
more
to
tell
you
have
now
heard
how
industry
in
itself
is
nothing
if
it
is
not
guided
and
sustained
by
providence
but
you
have
doubtless
also
perceived
that
the
best
fortune
which
heaven
here
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
reverently
can
bestow
upon
a
mortal
is
useless
indeed
unless
he
supplement
its
grace
by
his
own
energy
and
i
must
warn
you
in
closing
that
any
efforts
of
your
own
to
tread
in
the
path
i
have
described
would
very
probably
end
in
your
suffering
upon
the
market
place
of
the
city
that
ignominious
death
which
furnishes
in
the
public
executions
such
entertainment
to
the
vulgar
if
indeed
you
can
pass
the
first
stages
of
your
career
without
suffering
anything
more
fatal
than
the
bastinado
you
might
reach
at
last
some
such
great
position
as
i
occupy
indeed
mused
the
kindly
old
man
hareb
my
junior
partner
and
muktahr
whom
you
have
heard
called
the
camel
king
have
each
been
bastinadoed
most
severely
in
the
past
when
their
operations
were
upon
a
smaller
scale
but
we
are
content
to
forget
such
things
i
have
no
more
to
tell
you
work
as
hard
as
you
possibly
can
live
soberly
and
most
minutely
by
rule
and
so
long
as
any
dregs
of
strength
remain
to
you
struggle
to
retain
some
small
part
of
the
product
of
your
labour
for
the
support
of
yourselves
and
your
families
the
rest
will
in
the
natural
course
of
things
find
its
way
into
the
hands
of
men
like
myself
and
now
depart
with
my
benediction
but
stay
he
said
as
though
a
thought
had
struck
him
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
a
little
present
for
so
saying
the
kindly
old
man
went
to
a
cupboard
of
beautiful
inlaid
work
and
drawing
from
it
seven
dried
figs
in
the
last
stages
of
aridity
and
emaciation
he
presented
one
to
each
of
his
nephews
who
received
the
gift
with
transports
of
gratitude
and
affection
just
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
leave
the
youngest
boy
a
child
it
will
be
remembered
of
but
tender
years
approached
his
uncle
with
a
beautiful
mixture
of
humility
and
love
and
bringing
out
a
paper
which
he
had
secreted
in
the
folds
of
his
tunic
begged
the
merchant
to
sign
his
name
in
it
and
date
it
too
as
a
souvenir
of
these
delightful
mornings
with
all
my
heart
my
little
fellow
said
mahmoud
patting
him
upon
the
head
and
reflecting
that
such
good
deeds
cost
nothing
and
are
their
own
regard
this
done
the
boys
departed
next
morning
on
mahmoud
sending
a
slave
to
his
cashier
for
the
sum
required
to
pay
a
band
of
kurdish
torturers
whom
he
desired
to
hire
for
his
debtors
prison
he
was
annoyed
to
receive
the
reply
that
there
was
no
cash
immediately
available
a
large
draft
signed
by
him
having
been
presented
that
very
morning
and
duly
honoured
as
the
sum
was
considerable
and
as
the
payment
had
been
made
but
a
few
moments
before
the
cashier
begged
his
master
to
wait
for
half
an
hour
or
so
until
more
metal
could
be
procured
from
a
neighbouring
deposit
it
was
in
vain
that
mahmoud
searched
his
memory
for
the
signature
of
any
such
instrument
he
was
puzzled
and
suspected
a
forgery
at
last
he
determined
that
the
paper
should
be
sent
for
and
put
before
him
there
sure
enough
was
his
signature
but
the
sum
of
dinars
therein
mentioned
was
in
another
and
most
childish
hand
then
did
it
suddenly
break
upon
the
great
captain
of
industry
that
the
tiny
child
his
youngest
nephew
who
had
asked
for
his
autograph
as
a
souvenir
was
not
wholly
unworthy
of
the
blood
which
he
had
collaterally
inherited
he
wrote
to
the
boy
s
father
and
secured
the
little
fellow
s
services
as
at
he
watched
his
developing
talent
and
was
not
disappointed
long
before
the
lad
was
full
grown
he
had
got
every
clerk
of
the
great
business
house
into
his
debt
and
had
successfully
transferred
to
his
own
secret
the
savings
of
the
porter
the
carrier
and
the
aged
widow
who
cleaned
the
place
of
a
morning
by
his
seventeenth
year
he
had
brought
off
a
deal
in
fugitive
slaves
taking
equal
amounts
from
the
culprits
for
hiding
and
from
the
masters
for
betraying
them
by
his
eighteenth
he
had
control
of
a
public
bath
where
clients
were
watched
by
spies
and
thus
furnished
a
source
of
ample
revenue
before
he
was
of
age
he
had
astonished
and
delighted
his
now
more
than
octogenarian
uncle
by
selling
him
under
a
false
name
and
through
a
man
of
straw
a
ship
due
to
arrive
at
bosra
but
as
a
fact
sunk
off
bushire
five
days
before
in
every
way
he
showed
himself
worthy
of
his
uncle
s
confirmed
reliance
on
his
commercial
prowess
when
the
lad
came
of
age
the
venerable
mahmoud
gave
a
feast
of
unexampled
splendour
which
foreshadowed
his
intentions
for
indeed
but
a
month
later
the
old
man
began
to
fail
and
in
a
few
weeks
more
was
warned
by
his
physicians
of
approaching
death
he
summoned
scribes
to
his
bed
dictated
in
a
firm
voice
his
will
wherein
after
reciting
provision
already
made
under
heavy
pressure
for
his
wife
he
left
to
the
youngest
nephew
the
whole
of
his
wealth
saying
with
his
last
breath
allah
creator
and
lord
lest
the
talent
should
fall
into
unworthy
hands
