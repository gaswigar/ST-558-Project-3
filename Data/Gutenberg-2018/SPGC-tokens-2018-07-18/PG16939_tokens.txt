introduction
the
exile
of
bahá
u
lláh
in
iráq
began
under
the
harshest
of
conditions
and
at
the
lowest
ebb
in
the
fortunes
of
the
bábí
faith
it
witnessed
however
the
gradual
crystallization
of
those
potent
spiritual
forces
which
were
to
culminate
in
the
declaration
of
his
mission
in
in
the
course
of
these
years
and
from
the
city
of
there
radiated
shoghi
effendi
writes
wave
after
wave
a
power
a
radiance
and
a
glory
which
insensibly
reanimated
a
languishing
faith
sinking
into
obscurity
threatened
with
oblivion
from
it
were
diffused
day
and
night
and
with
energy
the
first
emanations
of
a
revelation
which
in
its
scope
its
copiousness
its
driving
force
and
the
volume
and
variety
of
its
literature
was
destined
to
excel
that
of
the
báb
among
these
early
effusions
of
the
pen
of
glory
is
a
lengthy
arabic
epistle
known
as
the
javáhiru
meaning
literally
the
gems
or
essences
of
mysteries
a
number
of
themes
it
enunciates
are
also
elaborated
in
different
revelatory
the
seven
valleys
and
the
book
of
certitude
those
two
immortal
volumes
which
shoghi
effendi
has
characterized
respectively
as
bahá
u
lláh
s
greatest
mystical
composition
and
his
doctrinal
work
undoubtedly
the
gems
of
divine
mysteries
figures
among
those
tablets
revealed
in
the
arabic
tongue
which
were
referred
to
in
the
latter
volume
one
of
the
central
themes
of
the
book
bahá
u
lláh
indicates
is
that
of
transformation
meaning
here
the
return
of
the
promised
one
in
a
different
human
guise
indeed
in
a
prefatory
note
written
above
the
opening
lines
of
the
original
manuscript
bahá
u
lláh
states
this
treatise
was
written
in
reply
to
a
seeker
who
had
asked
how
the
promised
mihdí
could
have
become
transformed
into
the
báb
the
opportunity
provided
by
this
question
was
seized
to
elaborate
on
a
number
of
subjects
all
of
which
are
of
use
and
benefit
both
to
them
that
seek
and
to
those
who
have
attained
could
ye
perceive
with
the
eye
of
divine
virtue
the
seeker
alluded
to
in
the
above
passage
was
siyyid
iṣfáhání
who
at
the
time
was
residing
in
karbilá
his
questions
were
presented
to
bahá
u
lláh
through
an
intermediary
and
this
tablet
was
revealed
in
response
on
the
same
day
a
number
of
other
important
themes
are
addressed
in
this
work
as
well
the
cause
of
the
rejection
of
the
prophets
of
the
past
the
danger
of
a
literal
reading
of
scripture
the
meaning
of
the
signs
and
portents
of
the
bible
concerning
the
advent
of
the
new
manifestation
the
continuity
of
divine
revelation
intimations
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
own
approaching
declaration
the
significance
of
such
symbolic
terms
as
the
day
of
judgement
the
resurrection
attainment
to
the
divine
presence
and
life
and
death
and
the
stages
of
the
spiritual
quest
through
the
garden
of
search
the
city
of
love
and
rapture
the
city
of
divine
unity
the
garden
of
wonderment
the
city
of
absolute
nothingness
the
city
of
immortality
and
the
city
that
hath
no
name
or
description
the
publication
of
gems
of
divine
mysteries
is
one
of
the
projects
undertaken
in
fulfilment
of
the
five
year
plan
goal
announced
in
april
of
enriching
the
translations
into
english
from
the
holy
texts
the
volume
will
further
deepen
the
western
reader
s
appreciation
of
a
period
infused
with
potentiality
and
described
by
shoghi
effendi
as
the
vernal
years
of
bahá
u
lláh
s
ministry
and
assist
the
students
of
his
revelation
in
gaining
a
more
profound
insight
into
its
gradual
unfoldment
gems
of
divine
mystery
the
essence
of
the
divine
mysteries
in
the
journeys
of
ascent
set
forth
for
those
who
long
to
draw
nigh
unto
god
the
almighty
the
be
the
righteous
that
quaff
from
these
crystal
streams
he
is
the
exalted
the
most
high
o
thou
who
treadest
the
path
of
justice
and
beholdest
the
countenance
of
mercy
thine
epistle
was
received
thy
question
was
noted
and
the
sweet
accents
of
thy
soul
were
heard
from
the
inmost
chambers
of
thy
heart
whereupon
the
clouds
of
the
divine
will
were
raised
to
rain
upon
thee
the
outpourings
of
heavenly
wisdom
to
divest
thee
of
all
that
thou
hadst
acquired
aforetime
to
draw
thee
from
the
realms
of
contradiction
unto
the
retreats
of
oneness
and
to
lead
thee
to
the
sacred
streams
of
his
law
perchance
thou
mayest
quaff
therefrom
repose
therein
quench
thy
thirst
refresh
thy
soul
and
be
numbered
with
those
whom
the
light
of
god
hath
guided
aright
in
this
day
encompassed
as
i
am
at
this
time
by
the
dogs
of
the
earth
and
the
beasts
of
every
land
concealed
as
i
remain
in
the
hidden
habitation
of
mine
inner
being
forbidden
as
i
may
be
from
divulging
that
which
god
hath
bestowed
upon
me
of
the
wonders
of
his
knowledge
the
gems
of
his
wisdom
and
the
tokens
of
his
power
yet
am
i
loath
to
frustrate
the
hopes
of
one
who
hath
approached
the
sanctuary
of
grandeur
sought
to
enter
within
the
precincts
of
eternity
and
aspired
to
soar
in
the
immensity
of
this
creation
at
the
dawning
of
the
divine
decree
i
shall
therefore
relate
unto
thee
certain
truths
from
among
those
which
god
hath
vouchsafed
unto
me
this
only
to
the
extent
that
souls
can
bear
and
minds
endure
lest
the
malicious
raise
a
clamour
or
the
dissemblers
hoist
their
banners
i
implore
god
to
graciously
aid
me
in
this
for
unto
such
as
beseech
him
he
is
the
and
of
those
who
show
mercy
he
is
the
most
merciful
know
then
that
it
behoveth
thine
eminence
to
ponder
from
the
outset
these
questions
in
thy
heart
what
hath
prompted
the
divers
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
to
reject
the
apostles
whom
god
hath
sent
unto
them
in
his
might
and
power
whom
he
hath
raised
up
to
exalt
his
cause
and
ordained
to
be
the
lamps
of
eternity
within
the
niche
of
his
oneness
for
what
reason
have
the
people
turned
aside
from
them
disputed
about
them
risen
against
and
contended
with
them
on
what
grounds
have
they
refused
to
acknowledge
their
apostleship
and
authority
nay
denied
their
truth
and
reviled
their
persons
even
slaying
or
banishing
them
o
thou
who
hast
set
foot
in
the
wilderness
of
knowledge
and
taken
abode
within
the
ark
of
wisdom
not
until
thou
hast
grasped
the
mysteries
concealed
in
that
which
we
shall
relate
unto
thee
canst
thou
hope
to
attain
to
the
stations
of
faith
and
certitude
in
the
cause
of
god
and
in
those
who
are
the
manifestations
of
his
cause
the
daysprings
of
his
command
the
treasuries
of
his
revelation
and
the
repositories
of
his
knowledge
shouldst
thou
fail
in
this
thou
wouldst
be
numbered
with
them
that
have
not
striven
for
the
cause
of
god
nor
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
faith
from
the
raiment
of
certitude
nor
scaled
the
heights
of
the
divine
unity
nor
yet
recognized
the
stations
of
divine
singleness
within
the
embodiments
of
praise
and
the
essences
of
sanctity
strive
then
o
my
brother
to
apprehend
this
matter
that
the
veils
may
be
lifted
from
the
face
of
thy
heart
and
that
thou
mayest
be
reckoned
among
them
whom
god
hath
graced
with
such
penetrating
vision
as
to
behold
the
most
subtle
realities
of
his
dominion
to
fathom
the
mysteries
of
his
kingdom
to
perceive
the
signs
of
his
transcendent
essence
in
this
mortal
world
and
to
attain
a
station
wherein
one
seeth
no
distinction
amongst
his
creatures
and
findeth
no
flaw
in
the
creation
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
now
that
the
discourse
hath
reached
this
exalted
and
intractable
theme
and
touched
upon
this
sublime
and
impenetrable
mystery
know
that
the
christian
and
jewish
peoples
have
not
grasped
the
intent
of
the
words
of
god
and
the
promises
he
hath
made
to
them
in
his
book
and
have
therefore
denied
his
cause
turned
aside
from
his
prophets
and
rejected
his
proofs
had
they
but
fixed
their
gaze
upon
the
testimony
of
god
itself
had
they
refused
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
abject
and
foolish
among
their
leaders
and
divines
they
would
doubtless
have
attained
to
the
repository
of
guidance
and
the
treasury
of
virtue
and
quaffed
from
the
crystal
waters
of
life
eternal
in
the
city
of
the
in
the
garden
of
the
and
within
the
inner
reality
of
his
paradise
but
as
they
have
refused
to
see
with
the
eyes
wherewith
god
hath
endowed
them
and
desired
things
other
than
that
which
he
in
his
mercy
had
desired
for
them
they
have
strayed
far
from
the
retreats
of
nearness
have
been
deprived
of
the
living
waters
of
reunion
and
the
wellspring
of
his
grace
and
have
lain
as
dead
within
the
shrouds
of
their
own
selves
through
the
power
of
god
and
his
might
i
shall
now
relate
certain
passages
revealed
in
the
books
of
old
and
mention
some
of
the
signs
heralding
the
appearance
of
the
manifestations
of
god
in
the
sanctified
persons
of
his
chosen
ones
that
thou
mayest
recognize
the
dayspring
of
this
everlasting
morn
and
behold
this
fire
that
blazeth
in
the
tree
which
is
neither
of
the
east
nor
of
the
west
perchance
thine
eyes
may
be
opened
upon
attaining
the
presence
of
thy
lord
and
thy
heart
partake
of
the
blessings
concealed
within
these
hidden
treasuries
render
thanks
then
unto
god
who
hath
singled
thee
out
for
this
grace
and
who
hath
numbered
thee
with
them
that
are
assured
of
meeting
their
lord
this
is
the
text
of
that
which
was
revealed
aforetime
in
the
first
gospel
according
to
matthew
regarding
the
signs
that
must
needs
herald
the
advent
of
the
one
who
shall
come
after
him
he
saith
and
woe
unto
them
that
are
with
child
and
to
them
that
give
suck
in
those
days
until
the
mystic
dove
singing
in
the
midmost
heart
of
eternity
and
the
celestial
bird
warbling
upon
the
divine
saith
immediately
after
the
oppression
of
those
days
shall
the
sun
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
and
the
powers
of
the
heavens
shall
be
shaken
and
then
shall
appear
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
in
heaven
and
then
shall
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
mourn
and
they
shall
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
and
he
shall
send
his
angels
with
a
great
sound
of
a
in
the
second
gospel
according
to
mark
the
dove
of
holiness
speaketh
in
such
terms
for
in
those
days
shall
be
affliction
such
as
was
not
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
which
god
created
unto
this
time
neither
shall
and
it
singeth
later
with
the
same
melodies
as
before
without
change
or
alteration
god
verily
is
a
witness
unto
the
truth
of
my
words
and
in
the
third
gospel
according
to
luke
it
is
recorded
there
shall
be
signs
in
the
sun
and
in
the
moon
and
in
the
stars
and
upon
the
earth
distress
of
nations
with
perplexity
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring
and
the
powers
of
heaven
shall
be
shaken
and
then
shall
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
a
cloud
with
power
and
great
glory
and
when
these
things
begin
to
come
to
pass
know
that
the
kingdom
of
god
hath
drawn
and
in
the
fourth
gospel
according
to
john
it
is
recorded
but
when
the
comforter
is
come
whom
i
will
send
unto
you
from
the
father
even
the
spirit
of
truth
which
proceedeth
from
the
father
he
shall
testify
of
me
and
ye
also
shall
bear
and
elsewhere
he
saith
but
the
comforter
which
is
the
holy
ghost
whom
the
father
will
send
in
my
name
he
shall
teach
you
all
things
and
bring
all
things
to
your
remembrance
whatsoever
i
have
said
unto
and
but
now
i
go
my
way
to
him
that
sent
me
and
none
of
you
asketh
me
whither
goest
thou
but
because
i
have
said
these
things
unto
you
and
yet
again
nevertheless
i
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
away
for
if
i
go
not
away
the
comforter
will
not
come
unto
you
but
if
i
depart
i
will
send
him
unto
and
howbeit
when
he
the
spirit
of
truth
is
come
he
will
guide
you
into
all
truth
for
he
shall
not
speak
of
himself
but
whatsoever
he
shall
hear
that
shall
he
speak
and
he
will
show
you
things
to
such
is
the
text
of
the
verses
revealed
in
the
past
by
him
besides
whom
there
is
none
other
god
i
have
chosen
to
be
brief
for
were
i
to
recount
all
the
words
that
have
been
sent
down
unto
the
prophets
of
god
from
the
realm
of
his
supernal
glory
and
the
kingdom
of
his
sovereign
might
all
the
pages
and
tablets
of
the
world
would
not
suffice
to
exhaust
my
theme
references
similar
to
those
mentioned
nay
even
more
sublime
and
exalted
have
been
made
in
all
the
books
and
scriptures
of
old
should
it
be
my
wish
to
recount
all
that
hath
been
revealed
in
the
past
i
would
most
certainly
be
able
to
do
so
by
virtue
of
that
which
god
hath
bestowed
upon
me
of
the
wonders
of
his
knowledge
and
power
i
have
however
contented
myself
with
that
which
was
mentioned
lest
thou
become
wearied
in
thy
journey
or
feel
inclined
to
turn
back
or
lest
thou
be
overtaken
by
sadness
and
sorrow
and
overcome
with
despondency
trouble
and
fatigue
be
fair
in
thy
judgement
and
reflect
upon
these
exalted
utterances
inquire
then
of
those
who
lay
claim
to
knowledge
without
a
proof
or
testimony
from
god
and
who
remain
heedless
of
these
days
wherein
the
orb
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
hath
dawned
above
the
horizon
of
divinity
rendering
unto
each
his
due
and
assigning
unto
all
their
rank
and
measure
as
to
what
they
can
say
concerning
these
allusions
verily
their
meaning
hath
bewildered
the
minds
of
men
and
that
which
they
conceal
of
the
consummate
wisdom
and
latent
knowledge
of
god
even
the
most
sanctified
souls
have
been
powerless
to
uncover
should
they
say
these
words
are
indeed
from
god
and
have
no
interpretation
other
than
their
outward
meaning
then
what
objection
can
they
raise
against
the
unbelievers
among
the
people
of
the
book
for
when
the
latter
saw
the
aforementioned
passages
in
their
scriptures
and
heard
the
literal
interpretations
of
their
divines
they
refused
to
recognize
god
in
those
who
are
the
manifestations
of
his
unity
the
exponents
of
his
singleness
and
the
embodiments
of
his
sanctity
and
failed
to
believe
in
them
and
submit
to
their
authority
the
reason
was
that
they
did
not
see
the
sun
darken
or
the
stars
of
heaven
fall
to
the
ground
or
the
angels
visibly
descend
upon
the
earth
and
hence
they
contended
with
the
prophets
and
messengers
of
god
nay
inasmuch
as
they
found
them
at
variance
with
their
own
faith
and
creed
they
hurled
against
them
such
accusations
of
imposture
folly
waywardness
and
misbelief
as
i
am
ashamed
to
recount
refer
to
the
qur
án
that
thou
mayest
find
mention
of
all
this
and
be
of
them
that
understand
its
meaning
even
to
this
day
do
these
people
await
the
appearance
of
that
which
they
have
learned
from
their
doctors
and
imbibed
from
their
divines
thus
do
they
say
when
shall
these
signs
be
made
manifest
that
we
may
believe
but
if
this
be
the
case
how
could
ye
refute
their
arguments
invalidate
their
proofs
and
challenge
them
concerning
their
faith
and
their
understanding
of
their
books
and
the
sayings
of
their
leaders
and
should
they
reply
the
books
that
are
in
the
hands
of
this
people
which
they
call
the
gospel
and
attribute
to
jesus
the
son
of
mary
have
not
been
revealed
by
god
and
proceed
not
from
the
manifestations
of
his
self
then
this
would
imply
a
cessation
in
the
abounding
grace
of
him
who
is
the
source
of
all
grace
if
so
god
s
testimony
to
his
servants
would
have
remained
incomplete
and
his
favour
proven
imperfect
his
mercy
would
not
have
shone
resplendent
nor
would
his
grace
have
overshadowed
all
for
if
at
the
ascension
of
jesus
his
book
had
likewise
ascended
unto
heaven
then
how
could
god
reprove
and
chastise
the
people
on
the
day
of
resurrection
as
hath
been
written
by
the
imáms
of
the
faith
and
affirmed
by
its
illustrious
divines
ponder
then
in
thine
heart
matters
being
such
as
thou
dost
witness
and
as
we
also
witness
where
canst
thou
flee
and
with
whom
shalt
thou
take
refuge
unto
whom
wilt
thou
turn
thy
gaze
in
what
land
shalt
thou
dwell
and
upon
what
seat
shalt
thou
abide
in
what
path
shalt
thou
tread
and
at
what
hour
wilt
thou
find
repose
what
shall
become
of
thee
in
the
end
where
shalt
thou
secure
the
cord
of
thy
faith
and
fasten
the
tie
of
thine
obedience
by
him
who
revealeth
himself
in
his
oneness
and
whose
own
self
beareth
witness
to
his
unity
should
there
be
ignited
in
thy
heart
the
burning
brand
of
the
love
of
god
thou
wouldst
seek
neither
rest
nor
composure
neither
laughter
nor
repose
but
wouldst
hasten
to
scale
the
highest
summits
in
the
realms
of
divine
nearness
sanctity
and
beauty
thou
wouldst
lament
as
a
soul
bereaved
and
weep
as
a
heart
filled
with
longing
nor
wouldst
thou
repair
to
thy
home
and
abode
unless
god
would
lay
bare
before
thee
his
cause
o
thou
who
hast
soared
to
the
realm
of
guidance
and
ascended
to
the
kingdom
of
virtue
shouldst
thou
desire
to
apprehend
these
celestial
allusions
to
witness
the
mysteries
of
divine
knowledge
and
to
become
acquainted
with
his
word
then
it
behoveth
thine
eminence
to
inquire
into
these
and
other
questions
pertaining
to
thine
origin
and
ultimate
goal
from
those
whom
god
hath
made
to
be
the
wellspring
of
his
knowledge
the
heaven
of
his
wisdom
and
the
ark
of
his
mysteries
for
were
it
not
for
those
effulgent
lights
that
shine
above
the
horizon
of
his
essence
the
people
would
know
not
their
left
hand
from
their
right
how
much
less
could
they
scale
the
heights
of
the
inner
realities
or
probe
the
depths
of
their
subtleties
we
beseech
god
therefore
to
immerse
us
in
these
surging
seas
to
grace
us
with
the
presence
of
these
breezes
and
to
cause
us
to
abide
in
these
divine
and
lofty
precincts
perchance
we
may
divest
ourselves
of
all
that
we
have
taken
from
each
other
and
strip
ourselves
of
such
borrowed
garments
as
we
have
stolen
from
our
fellow
men
that
he
may
attire
us
instead
with
the
robe
of
his
mercy
and
the
raiment
of
his
guidance
and
admit
us
into
the
city
of
knowledge
whosoever
entereth
this
city
will
comprehend
every
science
before
probing
into
its
mysteries
and
will
acquire
from
the
leaves
of
its
trees
a
knowledge
and
wisdom
encompassing
such
mysteries
of
divine
lordship
as
are
enshrined
within
the
treasuries
of
creation
glorified
be
god
its
creator
and
fashioner
above
all
that
he
hath
brought
forth
and
ordained
therein
by
god
the
sovereign
protector
the
the
almighty
were
i
to
unveil
to
thine
eyes
the
gates
of
this
city
which
have
been
fashioned
by
the
right
hand
of
might
and
power
thou
wouldst
behold
that
which
none
before
thee
hath
ever
beheld
and
wouldst
witness
that
which
no
other
soul
hath
ever
witnessed
thou
wouldst
apprehend
the
most
obscure
signs
and
the
most
abstruse
allusions
and
wouldst
clearly
behold
the
mysteries
of
the
beginning
in
the
point
of
the
end
all
matters
would
be
made
easy
unto
thee
fire
would
be
turned
into
light
knowledge
and
blessings
and
thou
wouldst
abide
in
safety
within
the
court
of
holiness
bereft
however
of
the
essence
of
the
mysteries
of
his
wisdom
which
we
have
imparted
unto
thee
beneath
the
veils
of
these
blessed
and
words
thou
wouldst
fail
to
attain
unto
even
a
sprinkling
of
the
oceans
of
divine
knowledge
or
the
crystal
streams
of
divine
power
and
wouldst
be
recorded
in
the
mother
book
through
the
pen
of
oneness
and
by
the
finger
of
god
amongst
the
ignorant
nor
wouldst
thou
be
able
to
grasp
a
single
word
of
the
book
or
a
single
utterance
of
the
kindred
of
god
concerning
the
mysteries
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
o
thou
whom
we
have
outwardly
never
met
yet
whom
we
inwardly
cherish
in
our
heart
be
fair
in
thy
judgement
and
present
thyself
before
him
who
seeth
and
knoweth
thee
even
if
thou
seest
and
knowest
him
not
can
any
soul
be
found
to
elucidate
these
words
with
such
convincing
arguments
clear
testimonies
and
unmistakable
allusions
as
to
appease
the
heart
of
the
seeker
and
relieve
the
soul
of
the
listener
nay
by
the
one
in
whose
hand
is
my
soul
unto
none
is
given
to
quaff
even
a
dewdrop
thereof
unless
he
entereth
within
this
city
a
city
whose
foundations
rest
upon
mountains
of
ruby
whose
walls
are
hewn
of
the
chrysolite
of
divine
unity
whose
gates
are
made
of
the
diamonds
of
immortality
and
whose
earth
sheddeth
the
fragrance
of
divine
bounty
having
imparted
unto
thee
beneath
countless
veils
of
concealment
certain
hidden
mysteries
we
now
return
to
our
elucidation
of
the
books
of
old
that
perchance
thy
feet
may
not
slip
and
thou
mayest
receive
with
complete
certitude
the
portion
which
we
shall
bestow
upon
thee
of
the
billowing
oceans
of
life
in
the
realm
of
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
it
is
recorded
in
all
the
books
of
the
gospel
that
he
who
is
the
spirit
spoke
in
words
of
pure
light
unto
his
disciples
saying
know
that
heaven
and
earth
may
pass
away
but
my
words
shall
never
pass
as
is
clear
and
evident
to
thine
eminence
these
words
outwardly
mean
that
the
books
of
the
gospel
will
remain
in
the
hands
of
people
till
the
end
of
the
world
that
their
laws
shall
not
be
abrogated
that
their
testimony
shall
not
be
abolished
and
that
all
that
hath
been
enjoined
prescribed
or
ordained
therein
shall
endure
forever
o
my
brother
sanctify
thy
heart
illumine
thy
soul
and
sharpen
thy
sight
that
thou
mayest
perceive
the
sweet
accents
of
the
birds
of
heaven
and
the
melodies
of
the
doves
of
holiness
warbling
in
the
kingdom
of
eternity
and
perchance
apprehend
the
inner
meaning
of
these
utterances
and
their
hidden
mysteries
for
otherwise
wert
thou
to
interpret
these
words
according
to
their
outward
meaning
thou
couldst
never
prove
the
truth
of
the
cause
of
him
who
came
after
jesus
nor
silence
the
opponents
nor
prevail
over
the
contending
disbelievers
for
the
christian
divines
use
this
verse
to
prove
that
the
gospel
shall
never
be
abrogated
and
that
even
if
all
the
signs
recorded
in
their
books
were
fulfilled
and
the
promised
one
appeared
he
would
have
no
recourse
but
to
rule
the
people
according
to
the
ordinances
of
the
gospel
they
contend
that
if
he
were
to
manifest
all
the
signs
indicated
in
the
books
but
decree
aught
besides
that
which
jesus
had
decreed
they
would
neither
acknowledge
nor
follow
him
so
clear
and
is
this
matter
in
their
sight
thou
canst
indeed
hear
the
learned
and
the
foolish
amongst
the
people
voice
the
same
objections
in
this
day
saying
the
sun
hath
not
risen
from
the
west
nor
hath
the
crier
cried
out
betwixt
earth
and
heaven
water
hath
not
inundated
certain
lands
the
dajjál
hath
not
appeared
súfyání
hath
not
arisen
nor
hath
the
temple
been
witnessed
in
the
i
heard
with
mine
own
ears
one
of
their
divines
proclaim
should
all
these
signs
come
to
pass
and
the
qá
im
appear
and
should
he
ordain
with
respect
to
even
our
secondary
laws
aught
beyond
that
which
hath
been
revealed
in
the
qur
án
we
would
assuredly
charge
him
with
imposture
put
him
to
death
and
refuse
forever
to
acknowledge
him
and
other
statements
such
as
these
deniers
make
and
all
this
when
the
day
of
resurrection
hath
been
ushered
in
and
the
trumpet
hath
been
sounded
and
all
the
denizens
of
earth
and
heaven
have
been
gathered
together
and
the
balance
hath
been
appointed
and
the
bridge
hath
been
laid
and
the
verses
have
been
sent
down
and
the
sun
hath
shone
forth
and
the
stars
have
been
blotted
out
and
the
souls
have
been
raised
to
life
and
the
breath
of
the
spirit
hath
blown
and
the
angels
have
been
arrayed
in
ranks
and
paradise
hath
been
brought
nigh
and
hell
made
to
blaze
these
things
have
all
come
to
pass
and
yet
to
this
day
not
a
single
one
of
these
people
hath
recognized
them
they
all
lie
as
dead
within
their
own
shrouds
save
those
who
have
believed
and
repaired
unto
god
who
rejoice
in
this
day
in
his
celestial
paradise
and
who
tread
the
path
of
his
veiled
as
they
remain
within
their
own
selves
the
generality
of
the
people
have
failed
to
perceive
the
sweet
accents
of
holiness
inhale
the
fragrance
of
mercy
or
seek
guidance
as
bidden
by
god
from
those
who
are
the
custodians
of
the
scriptures
he
proclaimeth
and
his
word
verily
is
the
truth
ask
ye
therefore
of
them
that
have
the
custody
of
the
scriptures
if
ye
know
it
nay
rather
they
have
turned
aside
from
them
and
followed
instead
the
sámirí
of
their
own
idle
fancies
thus
have
they
strayed
far
from
the
mercy
of
their
lord
and
failed
to
attain
unto
his
beauty
in
the
day
of
his
presence
for
no
sooner
had
he
come
unto
them
with
a
sign
and
a
testimony
from
god
than
the
same
people
who
had
eagerly
awaited
the
day
of
his
revelation
who
had
called
upon
him
in
the
daytime
and
in
the
night
season
who
had
implored
him
to
gather
them
together
in
his
presence
and
to
grant
that
they
may
lay
down
their
lives
in
his
path
be
led
aright
by
his
guidance
and
illumined
by
his
very
people
condemned
and
reviled
him
and
inflicted
upon
him
such
cruelties
as
transcend
both
my
capacity
to
tell
and
thine
ability
to
hear
them
my
very
pen
crieth
out
at
this
moment
and
the
ink
weepeth
sore
and
groaneth
by
god
wert
thou
to
hearken
with
thine
inner
ear
thou
wouldst
in
truth
hear
the
lamentations
of
the
denizens
of
heaven
and
wert
thou
to
remove
the
veil
from
before
thine
eyes
thou
wouldst
behold
the
maids
of
heaven
overcome
and
the
holy
souls
overwhelmed
beating
upon
their
faces
and
fallen
upon
the
dust
alas
alas
for
that
which
befell
him
who
was
the
manifestation
of
the
self
of
god
and
for
that
which
he
and
his
loved
ones
were
made
to
suffer
the
people
inflicted
upon
them
what
no
soul
hath
ever
inflicted
upon
another
and
what
no
infidel
hath
wrought
against
a
believer
or
suffered
at
his
hand
alas
alas
that
immortal
being
sat
upon
the
darksome
dust
the
holy
spirit
lamented
in
the
retreats
of
glory
the
pillars
of
the
throne
crumbled
in
the
exalted
dominion
the
joy
of
the
world
was
changed
into
sorrow
in
the
crimson
land
and
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
was
silenced
in
the
golden
realm
woe
betide
them
for
what
their
hands
have
wrought
and
for
what
they
have
committed
hearken
then
unto
that
which
the
bird
of
heaven
uttered
in
the
sweetest
and
most
wondrous
accents
and
in
the
most
perfect
and
exalted
melodies
concerning
utterance
that
shall
fill
them
with
remorse
from
now
unto
the
day
when
mankind
shall
stand
before
the
lord
of
the
worlds
although
they
had
before
prayed
for
victory
over
those
who
believed
not
yet
when
there
came
unto
them
he
of
whom
they
had
knowledge
they
disbelieved
in
him
the
curse
of
god
on
the
infidels
such
indeed
are
their
condition
and
attainments
in
their
vain
and
empty
life
erelong
shall
they
be
cast
into
the
fire
of
affliction
and
find
none
to
help
or
succour
them
be
not
veiled
by
aught
that
hath
been
revealed
in
the
qur
án
or
by
what
thou
hast
learned
from
the
works
of
those
suns
of
immaculacy
and
moons
of
majesty
regarding
the
perversion
of
the
texts
by
the
fanatical
or
their
alteration
by
their
corruptors
by
these
statements
only
certain
specific
and
clearly
indicated
passages
are
intended
in
spite
of
my
weakness
and
poverty
i
would
assuredly
be
able
should
i
so
desire
to
expound
these
passages
unto
thine
eminence
but
this
would
divert
us
from
our
purpose
and
lead
us
astray
from
the
outstretched
path
it
would
immerse
us
in
limited
allusions
and
distract
us
from
that
which
is
beloved
in
the
court
of
the
o
thou
who
art
mentioned
in
this
outspread
roll
and
who
amidst
the
gloomy
darkness
that
now
prevaileth
hast
been
illumined
by
the
splendours
of
the
sacred
mount
in
the
sinai
of
divine
revelation
cleanse
thy
heart
from
every
blasphemous
whispering
and
evil
allusion
thou
hast
heard
in
the
past
that
thou
mayest
inhale
the
sweet
savours
of
eternity
from
the
joseph
of
faithfulness
gain
admittance
into
the
celestial
egypt
and
perceive
the
fragrances
of
enlightenment
from
this
resplendent
and
luminous
tablet
a
tablet
wherein
the
pen
hath
inscribed
the
ancient
mysteries
of
the
names
of
his
lord
the
exalted
the
most
high
perchance
thou
mayest
be
recorded
in
the
holy
tablets
among
them
that
are
well
assured
o
thou
who
art
standing
before
my
throne
and
yet
remain
unaware
thereof
know
thou
that
whoso
seeketh
to
scale
the
summits
of
the
divine
mysteries
must
needs
strive
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
and
capacity
for
his
faith
that
the
pathway
of
guidance
may
be
made
clear
unto
him
and
should
he
encounter
one
who
layeth
claim
to
a
cause
from
god
and
who
holdeth
from
his
lord
a
testimony
beyond
the
power
of
men
to
produce
he
must
needs
follow
him
in
all
that
he
pleaseth
to
proclaim
command
and
ordain
even
were
he
to
decree
the
sea
to
be
land
or
to
pronounce
earth
to
be
heaven
or
that
the
former
lieth
above
the
latter
or
below
it
or
to
ordain
any
change
or
transformation
for
he
verily
is
aware
of
the
celestial
mysteries
the
unseen
subtleties
and
the
ordinances
of
god
were
the
peoples
of
every
nation
to
observe
that
which
hath
been
mentioned
the
matter
would
be
made
simple
unto
them
and
such
words
and
allusions
would
not
withhold
them
from
the
ocean
of
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
and
had
the
people
known
this
truth
they
would
not
have
denied
god
s
favours
nor
would
they
have
risen
against
contended
with
and
rejected
his
prophets
similar
passages
are
also
to
be
found
in
the
qur
án
should
the
matter
be
carefully
examined
know
moreover
that
it
is
through
such
words
that
god
proveth
his
servants
and
sifteth
them
separating
the
believer
from
the
infidel
the
detached
from
the
worldly
the
pious
from
the
profligate
the
doer
of
good
from
the
worker
of
iniquity
and
so
forth
thus
hath
the
dove
of
holiness
proclaimed
do
men
think
when
they
say
we
believe
they
shall
be
let
alone
and
not
be
put
to
proof
it
behoveth
him
who
is
a
wayfarer
in
the
path
of
god
and
a
wanderer
in
his
way
to
detach
himself
from
all
who
are
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
he
must
renounce
all
save
god
that
perchance
the
portals
of
mercy
may
be
unlocked
before
his
face
and
the
breezes
of
providence
may
waft
over
him
and
when
he
hath
inscribed
upon
his
soul
that
which
we
have
vouchsafed
unto
him
of
the
quintessence
of
inner
meaning
and
explanation
he
will
fathom
all
the
secrets
of
these
allusions
and
god
shall
bestow
upon
his
heart
a
divine
tranquillity
and
cause
him
to
be
of
them
that
are
at
peace
with
themselves
in
like
manner
wilt
thou
comprehend
the
meaning
of
all
the
ambiguous
verses
that
have
been
sent
down
concerning
the
question
thou
didst
ask
of
this
servant
who
abideth
upon
the
seat
of
abasement
who
walketh
upon
the
earth
as
an
exile
with
none
to
befriend
comfort
aid
or
assist
him
who
hath
placed
his
whole
trust
in
god
and
who
proclaimeth
at
all
times
verily
we
are
god
s
and
to
him
shall
we
know
thou
that
the
passages
that
we
have
called
ambiguous
appear
as
such
only
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
have
failed
to
soar
above
the
horizon
of
guidance
and
to
reach
the
heights
of
knowledge
in
the
retreats
of
grace
for
otherwise
unto
them
that
have
recognized
the
repositories
of
divine
revelation
and
beheld
through
his
inspiration
the
mysteries
of
divine
authority
all
the
verses
of
god
are
perspicuous
and
all
his
allusions
are
clear
such
men
discern
the
inner
mysteries
that
have
been
clothed
in
the
garment
of
words
as
clearly
as
ye
perceive
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
the
wetness
of
water
nay
even
more
distinctly
immeasurably
exalted
is
god
above
our
praise
of
his
loved
ones
and
beyond
their
praise
of
him
now
that
we
have
reached
this
most
excellent
theme
and
attained
such
lofty
heights
by
virtue
of
that
which
hath
flowed
from
this
pen
through
the
incomparable
favours
of
god
the
exalted
the
most
high
it
is
our
wish
to
disclose
unto
thee
certain
stations
in
the
wayfarer
s
journey
towards
his
creator
perchance
all
that
thine
eminence
hath
desired
may
be
revealed
unto
thee
that
the
proof
may
be
made
complete
and
the
blessing
abundant
know
thou
of
a
truth
that
the
seeker
must
at
the
beginning
of
his
quest
for
god
enter
the
garden
of
search
in
this
journey
it
behoveth
the
wayfarer
to
detach
himself
from
all
save
god
and
to
close
his
eyes
to
all
that
is
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
there
must
not
linger
in
his
heart
either
the
hate
or
the
love
of
any
soul
to
the
extent
that
they
would
hinder
him
from
attaining
the
habitation
of
the
celestial
beauty
he
must
sanctify
his
soul
from
the
veils
of
glory
and
refrain
from
boasting
of
such
worldly
vanities
outward
knowledge
or
other
gifts
as
god
may
have
bestowed
upon
him
he
must
search
after
the
truth
to
the
utmost
of
his
ability
and
exertion
that
god
may
guide
him
in
the
paths
of
his
favour
and
the
ways
of
his
mercy
for
he
verily
is
the
best
of
helpers
unto
his
servants
he
saith
and
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
whoso
maketh
efforts
for
us
in
our
ways
shall
we
assuredly
guide
and
furthermore
fear
god
and
god
will
give
you
in
this
journey
the
seeker
becometh
witness
to
a
myriad
changes
and
transformations
confluences
and
divergences
he
beholdeth
the
wonders
of
divinity
in
the
mysteries
of
creation
and
discovereth
the
paths
of
guidance
and
the
ways
of
his
lord
such
is
the
station
reached
by
them
that
search
after
god
and
such
are
the
heights
attained
by
those
who
hasten
unto
him
when
once
the
seeker
hath
ascended
unto
this
station
he
will
enter
the
city
of
love
and
rapture
whereupon
the
winds
of
love
will
blow
and
the
breezes
of
the
spirit
will
waft
in
this
station
the
seeker
is
so
overcome
by
the
ecstasies
of
yearning
and
the
fragrances
of
longing
that
he
discerneth
not
his
left
from
his
right
nor
doth
he
distinguish
land
from
sea
or
desert
from
mountain
at
every
moment
he
burneth
with
the
fire
of
longing
and
is
consumed
by
the
onslaught
of
separation
in
this
world
he
speedeth
through
the
párán
of
love
and
traverseth
the
horeb
of
rapture
now
he
laugheth
now
he
weepeth
sore
now
he
reposeth
in
peace
now
he
trembleth
in
fear
nothing
can
alarm
him
naught
can
thwart
his
purpose
and
no
law
can
restrain
him
he
standeth
ready
to
obey
whatsoever
his
lord
should
please
to
decree
as
to
his
beginning
and
his
end
with
every
breath
he
layeth
down
his
life
and
offereth
up
his
soul
he
bareth
his
breast
to
meet
the
darts
of
the
enemy
and
raiseth
his
head
to
greet
the
sword
of
destiny
nay
rather
he
kisseth
the
hand
of
his
murderer
and
surrendereth
his
all
he
yieldeth
up
spirit
soul
and
body
in
the
path
of
his
lord
and
yet
he
doeth
so
by
the
leave
of
his
beloved
and
not
of
his
own
whim
and
desire
thou
findest
him
chill
in
the
fire
and
dry
in
the
sea
abiding
in
every
land
and
treading
every
path
whosoever
toucheth
him
in
this
state
will
perceive
the
heat
of
his
love
he
walketh
the
heights
of
detachment
and
traverseth
the
vale
of
renunciation
his
eyes
are
ever
expectant
to
witness
the
wonders
of
god
s
mercy
and
eager
to
behold
the
splendours
of
his
beauty
blessed
indeed
are
they
that
have
attained
unto
such
a
station
for
this
is
the
station
of
the
ardent
lovers
and
the
enraptured
souls
and
when
this
stage
of
the
journey
is
completed
and
the
wayfarer
hath
soared
beyond
this
lofty
station
he
entereth
the
city
of
divine
unity
and
the
garden
of
oneness
and
the
court
of
detachment
in
this
plane
the
seeker
casteth
away
all
signs
allusions
veils
and
words
and
beholdeth
all
things
with
an
eye
illumined
by
the
effulgent
lights
which
god
himself
hath
shed
upon
him
in
his
journey
he
seeth
all
differences
return
to
a
single
word
and
all
allusions
culminate
in
a
single
point
unto
this
beareth
witness
he
who
sailed
upon
the
ark
of
fire
and
followed
the
inmost
path
to
the
pinnacle
of
glory
in
the
realm
of
immortality
knowledge
is
one
point
which
the
foolish
have
this
is
the
station
that
hath
been
alluded
to
in
the
tradition
i
am
he
himself
and
he
is
i
myself
except
that
i
am
that
i
am
and
he
is
that
he
in
this
station
were
he
who
is
the
embodiment
of
the
end
to
say
verily
i
am
the
point
of
the
beginning
he
would
indeed
be
speaking
the
truth
and
were
he
to
say
i
am
other
than
him
this
would
be
equally
true
likewise
were
he
to
proclaim
verily
i
am
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
or
the
king
of
kings
or
the
lord
of
the
realm
above
or
muhammad
or
alí
or
their
descendants
or
aught
else
he
would
indeed
be
proclaiming
the
truth
of
god
he
verily
ruleth
over
all
created
things
and
standeth
supreme
above
all
besides
him
hast
thou
not
heard
what
hath
been
said
aforetime
muhammad
is
our
first
muhammad
our
last
muhammad
our
all
and
elsewhere
they
all
proceed
from
the
same
light
in
this
station
the
truth
of
the
unity
of
god
and
of
the
signs
of
his
sanctity
is
established
thou
shalt
indeed
see
them
all
rising
above
the
bosom
of
god
s
might
and
embraced
in
the
arms
of
his
mercy
nor
can
any
distinction
be
made
between
his
bosom
and
his
arms
to
speak
of
change
or
transformation
in
this
plane
would
be
sheer
blasphemy
and
utter
impiety
for
this
is
the
station
wherein
the
light
of
divine
unity
shineth
forth
and
the
truth
of
his
oneness
is
expressed
and
the
splendours
of
the
everlasting
morn
are
reflected
in
lofty
and
faithful
mirrors
by
god
were
i
to
reveal
the
full
measure
of
that
which
he
hath
ordained
for
this
station
the
souls
of
men
would
depart
from
their
bodies
the
inner
realities
of
all
things
would
be
shaken
in
their
foundations
they
that
dwell
within
the
realms
of
creation
would
be
dumbfounded
and
those
who
move
in
the
lands
of
allusion
would
fade
into
utter
nothingness
hast
thou
not
heard
no
change
is
there
in
god
s
creation
hast
thou
not
read
no
change
canst
thou
find
in
god
s
mode
of
dealing
hast
thou
not
borne
witness
to
the
truth
no
difference
wilt
thou
see
in
the
creation
of
the
god
of
mercy
yea
by
my
lord
they
that
dwell
within
this
ocean
they
that
ride
upon
this
ark
witness
no
change
in
the
creation
of
god
and
behold
no
differences
upon
his
earth
and
if
god
s
creation
be
not
prone
to
change
and
alteration
how
then
could
they
who
are
the
manifestations
of
his
own
being
be
subject
to
it
immeasurably
exalted
is
god
above
all
that
we
may
conceive
of
the
revealers
of
his
cause
and
immensely
glorified
is
he
beyond
all
that
they
may
mention
in
his
regard
great
god
this
sea
had
laid
up
lustrous
pearls
in
store
the
wind
hath
raised
a
wave
that
casteth
them
ashore
so
put
away
thy
robe
and
drown
thyself
therein
and
cease
to
boast
of
skill
it
serveth
thee
no
more
if
thou
be
of
the
inmates
of
this
city
within
the
ocean
of
divine
unity
thou
wilt
view
all
the
prophets
and
messengers
of
god
as
one
soul
and
one
body
as
one
light
and
one
spirit
in
such
wise
that
the
first
among
them
would
be
last
and
the
last
would
be
first
for
they
have
all
arisen
to
proclaim
his
cause
and
have
established
the
laws
of
divine
wisdom
they
are
one
and
all
the
manifestations
of
his
self
the
repositories
of
his
might
the
treasuries
of
his
revelation
the
of
his
splendour
and
the
daysprings
of
his
light
through
them
are
manifested
the
signs
of
sanctity
in
the
realities
of
all
things
and
the
tokens
of
oneness
in
the
essences
of
all
beings
through
them
are
revealed
the
elements
of
glorification
in
the
heavenly
realities
and
the
exponents
of
praise
in
the
eternal
essences
from
them
hath
all
creation
proceeded
and
unto
them
shall
return
all
that
hath
been
mentioned
and
since
in
their
inmost
beings
they
are
the
same
luminaries
and
the
mysteries
thou
shouldst
view
their
outward
conditions
in
the
same
light
that
thou
mayest
recognize
them
all
as
one
being
nay
find
them
united
in
their
words
speech
and
utterance
wert
thou
to
consider
in
this
station
the
last
of
them
to
be
the
first
or
conversely
thou
wouldst
indeed
be
speaking
the
truth
as
hath
been
ordained
by
him
who
is
the
wellspring
of
divinity
and
the
source
of
lordship
say
call
upon
god
or
call
upon
the
by
whichsoever
name
ye
will
invoke
him
for
he
hath
most
excellent
for
they
are
all
the
manifestations
of
the
name
of
god
the
of
his
attributes
the
repositories
of
his
might
and
the
focal
points
of
his
sovereignty
whilst
be
his
might
and
in
his
essence
sanctified
above
all
names
and
exalted
beyond
even
the
loftiest
attributes
consider
likewise
the
evidences
of
divine
omnipotence
both
in
their
souls
and
in
their
human
temples
that
thine
heart
may
be
assured
and
that
thou
mayest
be
of
them
that
speed
through
the
realms
of
his
nearness
i
shall
restate
here
my
theme
that
perchance
this
may
assist
thee
in
recognizing
thy
creator
know
thou
that
and
glorified
be
in
no
wise
manifest
his
inmost
essence
and
reality
from
time
immemorial
he
hath
been
veiled
in
the
eternity
of
his
essence
and
concealed
in
the
infinitude
of
his
own
being
and
when
he
purposed
to
manifest
his
beauty
in
the
kingdom
of
names
and
to
reveal
his
glory
in
the
realm
of
attributes
he
brought
forth
his
prophets
from
the
invisible
plane
to
the
visible
that
his
name
the
manifest
might
be
distinguished
from
the
hidden
and
his
name
the
last
might
be
discerned
from
the
first
and
that
there
may
be
fulfilled
the
words
he
is
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
the
hidden
and
he
knoweth
all
things
thus
hath
he
revealed
these
most
excellent
names
and
most
exalted
words
in
the
manifestations
of
his
self
and
the
mirrors
of
his
being
it
is
therefore
established
that
all
names
and
attributes
return
unto
these
sublime
and
sanctified
luminaries
indeed
all
names
are
to
be
found
in
their
names
and
all
attributes
can
be
seen
in
their
attributes
viewed
in
this
light
if
thou
wert
to
call
them
by
all
the
names
of
god
this
would
be
true
as
all
these
names
are
one
and
the
same
as
their
own
being
comprehend
then
the
intent
of
these
words
and
guard
it
within
the
tabernacle
of
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
recognize
the
implications
of
thine
inquiry
fulfil
them
according
to
that
which
god
hath
ordained
for
thee
and
thus
be
numbered
with
those
who
have
attained
unto
his
purpose
all
that
thou
hast
heard
regarding
muhammad
the
son
of
hasan
the
souls
of
all
that
are
immersed
in
the
oceans
of
the
spirit
be
offered
up
for
his
true
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
we
all
verily
bear
allegiance
unto
him
but
the
imáms
of
the
faith
have
fixed
his
abode
in
the
city
of
jábulqá
which
they
have
depicted
in
strange
and
marvellous
signs
to
interpret
this
city
according
to
the
literal
meaning
of
the
tradition
would
indeed
prove
impossible
nor
can
such
a
city
ever
be
found
wert
thou
to
search
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
earth
nay
probe
its
length
and
breadth
for
as
long
as
god
s
eternity
hath
lasted
and
his
sovereignty
will
endure
thou
wouldst
never
find
a
city
such
as
they
have
described
for
the
entirety
of
the
earth
could
neither
contain
nor
encompass
it
if
thou
wouldst
lead
me
unto
this
city
i
could
assuredly
lead
thee
unto
this
holy
being
whom
the
people
have
conceived
according
to
what
they
possess
and
not
to
that
which
pertaineth
unto
him
since
this
is
not
in
thy
power
thou
hast
no
recourse
but
to
interpret
symbolically
the
accounts
and
traditions
that
have
been
reported
from
these
luminous
souls
and
as
such
an
interpretation
is
needed
for
the
traditions
pertaining
to
the
aforementioned
city
so
too
is
it
required
for
this
holy
being
when
thou
hast
understood
this
interpretation
thou
shalt
no
longer
stand
in
need
of
transformation
or
aught
else
know
then
that
inasmuch
as
all
the
prophets
are
but
one
and
the
same
soul
spirit
name
and
attribute
thou
must
likewise
see
them
all
as
bearing
the
name
muhammad
and
as
being
the
son
of
hasan
as
having
appeared
from
the
jábulqá
of
god
s
power
and
from
the
jábulsá
of
his
mercy
for
by
jábulqá
is
meant
none
other
than
the
of
eternity
in
the
heaven
and
the
cities
of
the
unseen
in
the
supernal
realm
we
bear
witness
that
muhammad
the
son
of
hasan
was
indeed
in
jábulqá
and
appeared
therefrom
likewise
he
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
abideth
in
that
city
until
such
time
as
god
will
have
established
him
upon
the
seat
of
his
sovereignty
we
verily
acknowledge
this
truth
and
bear
allegiance
unto
each
and
every
one
of
them
we
have
chosen
here
to
be
brief
in
our
elucidation
of
the
meanings
of
jábulqá
but
if
thou
be
of
them
that
truly
believe
thou
shalt
indeed
comprehend
all
the
true
meanings
of
the
mysteries
enshrined
within
these
tablets
but
as
to
him
who
appeared
in
the
year
sixty
he
standeth
in
need
of
neither
transformation
nor
interpretation
for
his
name
was
muhammad
and
he
was
a
descendent
of
the
imáms
of
the
faith
thus
it
can
be
truly
said
of
him
that
he
was
the
son
of
hasan
as
is
undoubtedly
clear
and
evident
unto
thine
eminence
nay
he
it
is
who
fashioned
that
name
and
created
it
for
himself
were
ye
to
observe
with
the
eye
of
god
it
is
our
wish
at
this
juncture
to
digress
from
our
theme
to
recount
that
which
befell
the
point
of
the
qur
án
and
to
extol
his
remembrance
that
perchance
thou
mayest
gain
into
all
things
an
insight
born
of
him
who
is
the
almighty
the
incomparable
consider
and
reflect
upon
his
days
when
god
raised
him
up
to
promote
his
cause
and
to
stand
as
the
representative
of
his
own
self
witness
how
he
was
assailed
denied
and
denounced
by
all
how
when
he
set
foot
in
the
streets
and
marketplaces
the
people
derided
him
wagged
their
heads
at
him
and
laughed
him
to
scorn
how
at
every
moment
they
sought
to
slay
him
such
were
their
doings
that
the
earth
in
all
its
vastness
was
straitened
for
him
the
concourse
on
high
bewailed
his
plight
the
foundations
of
existence
were
reduced
to
nothingness
and
the
eyes
of
the
denizens
of
his
kingdom
wept
sore
over
him
indeed
so
grievous
were
the
afflictions
which
the
infidels
and
the
wicked
showered
upon
him
that
no
faithful
soul
can
bear
to
hear
them
if
these
wayward
souls
had
indeed
paused
to
reflect
upon
their
conduct
recognized
the
sweet
melodies
of
that
mystic
dove
singing
upon
the
twigs
of
this
tree
embraced
that
which
god
had
revealed
unto
and
bestowed
upon
them
and
discovered
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
god
upon
its
branches
wherefore
then
did
they
reject
and
denounce
him
had
they
not
lifted
their
heads
to
the
heavens
to
implore
his
appearance
had
they
not
besought
god
at
every
moment
to
honour
them
with
his
beauty
and
sustain
them
through
his
presence
but
as
they
failed
to
recognize
the
accents
of
god
and
the
divine
mysteries
and
holy
allusions
enshrined
in
that
which
flowed
from
the
tongue
of
muhammad
and
as
they
neglected
to
examine
the
matter
in
their
own
hearts
and
followed
instead
those
priests
of
error
who
have
hindered
the
progress
of
the
people
in
past
dispensations
and
who
will
continue
to
do
so
in
future
cycles
they
were
thus
veiled
from
the
divine
purpose
failed
to
quaff
from
the
celestial
streams
and
deprived
themselves
of
the
presence
of
god
the
manifestation
of
his
essence
and
the
dayspring
of
his
eternity
thus
did
they
wander
in
the
paths
of
delusion
and
the
ways
of
heedlessness
and
return
to
their
abode
in
that
fire
which
feedeth
on
their
own
souls
these
verily
are
numbered
with
the
infidels
whose
names
have
been
inscribed
by
the
pen
of
god
in
his
holy
book
nor
have
they
ever
found
or
will
ever
find
a
friend
or
helper
had
these
souls
but
clung
steadfastly
to
the
handle
of
god
manifested
in
the
person
of
muhammad
had
they
turned
wholly
unto
god
and
cast
aside
all
that
they
had
learned
from
their
divines
he
would
assuredly
have
guided
them
through
his
grace
and
acquainted
them
with
the
sacred
truths
that
are
enshrined
within
his
imperishable
utterances
for
far
be
it
from
his
greatness
and
his
glory
that
he
should
turn
away
a
seeker
at
his
door
cast
aside
from
his
threshold
one
who
hath
set
his
hopes
on
him
reject
one
who
hath
sought
the
shelter
of
his
shade
deprive
one
who
hath
held
fast
to
the
hem
of
his
mercy
or
condemn
to
remoteness
the
poor
one
who
hath
found
the
river
of
his
riches
but
as
these
people
failed
to
turn
wholly
unto
god
and
to
hold
fast
to
the
hem
of
his
mercy
at
the
appearance
of
the
daystar
of
truth
they
passed
out
from
under
the
shadow
of
guidance
and
entered
the
city
of
error
thus
did
they
become
corrupt
and
corrupt
the
people
thus
did
they
err
and
lead
the
people
into
error
and
thus
were
they
recorded
among
the
oppressors
in
the
books
of
heaven
now
that
this
evanescent
one
hath
reached
this
exalted
point
in
the
exposition
of
the
inner
mysteries
the
reason
for
the
denial
of
these
uncouth
souls
will
be
described
briefly
that
it
may
serve
as
a
testimony
unto
them
that
are
endued
with
understanding
and
insight
and
be
a
token
of
my
favour
unto
the
concourse
of
the
faithful
know
then
that
when
muhammad
the
point
of
the
qur
án
and
the
light
of
the
came
with
perspicuous
verses
and
luminous
proofs
manifested
in
such
signs
as
are
beyond
the
power
of
all
existence
to
produce
he
bade
all
men
follow
this
lofty
and
outstretched
path
in
accordance
with
the
precepts
that
he
had
brought
from
god
whoso
acknowledged
him
recognized
the
signs
of
god
in
his
inmost
being
and
saw
in
his
beauty
the
changeless
beauty
of
god
the
decree
of
resurrection
ingathering
life
and
paradise
was
passed
upon
him
for
he
who
had
believed
in
god
and
in
the
manifestation
of
his
beauty
was
raised
from
the
grave
of
heedlessness
gathered
together
in
the
sacred
ground
of
the
heart
quickened
to
the
life
of
faith
and
certitude
and
admitted
into
the
paradise
of
the
divine
presence
what
paradise
can
be
loftier
than
this
what
ingathering
mightier
and
what
resurrection
greater
indeed
should
a
soul
be
acquainted
with
these
mysteries
he
would
grasp
that
which
none
other
hath
fathomed
know
then
that
the
paradise
that
appeareth
in
the
day
of
god
surpasseth
every
other
paradise
and
excelleth
the
realities
of
heaven
for
when
and
glorified
is
the
station
of
prophethood
in
the
person
of
him
who
was
his
friend
his
chosen
one
and
his
treasure
amongst
his
creatures
as
hath
been
revealed
from
the
kingdom
of
glory
but
he
is
the
apostle
of
god
and
the
seal
of
the
prophets
he
promised
all
men
that
they
shall
attain
unto
his
own
presence
in
the
day
of
resurrection
in
this
he
meant
to
emphasize
the
greatness
of
the
revelation
to
come
as
it
hath
indeed
been
manifested
through
the
power
of
truth
and
there
is
of
a
certainty
no
paradise
greater
than
this
nor
station
higher
should
ye
reflect
upon
the
verses
of
the
qur
án
blessed
be
he
who
knoweth
of
a
certainty
that
he
shall
attain
unto
the
presence
of
god
on
that
day
when
his
beauty
shall
be
made
manifest
were
i
to
recount
all
the
verses
that
have
been
revealed
in
connection
with
this
exalted
theme
it
would
weary
the
reader
and
divert
us
from
our
purpose
the
following
verse
shall
therefore
suffice
us
may
thine
eyes
be
solaced
therewith
and
mayest
thou
attain
unto
that
which
hath
been
treasured
and
concealed
therein
it
is
god
who
hath
reared
the
heavens
without
pillars
thou
canst
behold
then
mounted
his
throne
and
imposed
laws
on
the
sun
and
moon
each
travelleth
to
its
appointed
goal
he
ordereth
all
things
he
maketh
his
signs
clear
that
ye
may
have
firm
faith
in
the
presence
of
your
ponder
then
o
my
friend
the
words
firm
faith
that
have
been
mentioned
in
this
verse
it
saith
that
the
heavens
and
the
earth
the
throne
the
sun
and
the
moon
all
have
been
created
to
the
end
that
his
servants
may
have
unswerving
faith
in
his
presence
in
his
days
by
the
righteousness
of
god
contemplate
o
my
brother
the
greatness
of
this
station
and
behold
the
condition
of
the
people
in
these
days
fleeing
from
the
countenance
of
god
and
his
beauty
as
though
they
were
affrighted
asses
wert
thou
to
reflect
upon
that
which
we
have
revealed
unto
thee
thou
wouldst
undoubtedly
grasp
our
purpose
in
this
utterance
and
discover
that
which
we
have
desired
to
impart
unto
thee
within
this
paradise
perchance
thine
eyes
may
rejoice
in
beholding
it
thine
ears
take
delight
in
hearing
that
which
is
recited
therein
thy
soul
be
enthralled
by
recognizing
it
thy
heart
illumined
by
comprehending
it
and
thy
spirit
gladdened
by
the
fragrant
breezes
that
waft
therefrom
haply
thou
mayest
attain
unto
the
pinnacle
of
divine
grace
and
abide
within
the
ridván
of
transcendent
holiness
he
however
who
denied
god
in
his
truth
who
turned
his
back
upon
him
and
rebelled
who
disbelieved
and
made
mischief
the
verdict
of
impiety
blasphemy
death
and
fire
was
passed
upon
him
for
what
blasphemy
is
greater
than
to
turn
unto
the
manifestations
of
satan
to
follow
the
doctors
of
oblivion
and
the
people
of
rebellion
what
impiety
is
more
grievous
than
to
deny
the
lord
on
the
day
when
faith
itself
is
renewed
and
regenerated
by
god
the
almighty
the
beneficent
what
death
is
more
wretched
than
to
flee
from
the
source
of
everlasting
life
what
fire
is
fiercer
on
the
day
of
reckoning
than
that
of
remoteness
from
the
divine
beauty
and
the
celestial
glory
these
were
the
very
words
and
utterances
used
by
the
pagan
arabs
living
in
the
days
of
muhammad
to
dispute
with
and
pronounce
judgement
against
him
they
said
those
who
believed
in
muhammad
dwelt
in
our
midst
and
associated
with
us
day
and
night
when
did
they
die
and
when
were
they
raised
again
to
life
hearken
unto
that
which
was
revealed
in
reply
if
ever
thou
dost
marvel
marvellous
surely
is
their
saying
what
when
we
have
become
dust
and
mouldering
bones
shall
we
be
restored
in
a
new
creation
and
in
another
passage
and
if
thou
shouldst
say
after
death
ye
shall
surely
be
raised
again
the
infidels
will
certainly
exclaim
this
is
naught
but
palpable
thus
did
they
mock
and
deride
him
for
they
had
read
in
their
books
and
heard
from
their
divines
the
terms
life
and
death
and
understood
them
as
this
elemental
life
and
physical
death
and
hence
when
they
found
not
that
which
their
vain
imaginings
and
their
false
and
wicked
minds
had
conceived
they
hoisted
the
banners
of
discord
and
the
standards
of
sedition
and
kindled
the
flame
of
war
god
however
quenched
it
through
the
power
of
his
might
as
thou
seest
again
in
this
day
with
these
infidels
and
at
this
hour
when
the
sweet
savours
of
attraction
have
wafted
over
me
from
the
everlasting
city
when
transports
of
yearning
have
seized
me
from
the
land
of
splendours
at
the
dawning
of
the
daystar
of
the
worlds
above
the
horizon
of
iráq
and
the
sweet
melodies
of
ḥijáz
have
brought
to
mine
ears
the
mysteries
of
separation
i
have
purposed
to
relate
unto
thine
eminence
a
portion
of
that
which
the
mystic
dove
hath
warbled
in
the
midmost
heart
of
paradise
as
to
the
true
meaning
of
life
and
death
though
the
task
be
impossible
for
were
i
to
interpret
these
words
for
thee
as
it
hath
been
inscribed
in
the
guarded
tablets
all
the
books
and
pages
of
the
world
could
not
contain
it
nor
could
the
souls
of
men
bear
its
weight
i
shall
nonetheless
mention
that
which
beseemeth
this
day
and
age
that
it
might
serve
as
a
guidance
unto
whosoever
desireth
to
gain
admittance
into
the
retreats
of
glory
in
the
realms
above
to
hearken
unto
the
melodies
of
the
spirit
intoned
by
this
divine
and
mystic
bird
and
to
be
numbered
with
those
who
have
severed
themselves
from
all
save
god
and
who
in
this
day
rejoice
in
the
presence
of
their
lord
know
then
that
life
hath
a
twofold
meaning
the
first
pertaineth
to
the
appearance
of
man
in
an
elemental
body
and
is
as
manifest
to
thine
eminence
and
to
others
as
the
midday
sun
this
life
cometh
to
an
end
with
physical
death
which
is
a
and
inescapable
reality
that
life
however
which
is
mentioned
in
the
books
of
the
prophets
and
the
chosen
ones
of
god
is
the
life
of
knowledge
that
is
to
say
the
servant
s
recognition
of
the
sign
of
the
splendours
wherewith
he
who
is
the
source
of
all
splendour
hath
himself
invested
him
and
his
certitude
of
attaining
unto
the
presence
of
god
through
the
manifestations
of
his
cause
this
is
that
blessed
and
everlasting
life
that
perisheth
not
whosoever
is
quickened
thereby
shall
never
die
but
will
endure
as
long
as
his
lord
and
creator
will
endure
the
first
life
which
pertaineth
to
the
elemental
body
will
come
to
an
end
as
hath
been
revealed
by
god
every
soul
shall
taste
of
but
the
second
life
which
ariseth
from
the
knowledge
of
god
knoweth
no
death
as
hath
been
revealed
aforetime
him
will
we
surely
quicken
to
a
blessed
and
in
another
passage
concerning
the
martyrs
nay
they
are
alive
and
sustained
by
their
and
from
the
traditions
he
who
is
a
true
believer
liveth
both
in
this
world
and
in
the
world
to
numerous
examples
of
similar
words
are
to
be
found
in
the
books
of
god
and
of
the
embodiments
of
his
justice
for
the
sake
of
brevity
however
we
have
contented
ourself
with
the
above
passages
o
my
brother
forsake
thine
own
desires
turn
thy
face
unto
thy
lord
and
walk
not
in
the
footsteps
of
those
who
have
taken
their
corrupt
inclinations
for
their
god
that
perchance
thou
mayest
find
shelter
in
the
heart
of
existence
beneath
the
redeeming
shadow
of
him
who
traineth
all
names
and
attributes
for
they
who
turn
away
from
their
lord
in
this
day
are
in
truth
accounted
amongst
the
dead
though
to
outward
seeming
they
may
walk
upon
the
earth
amongst
the
deaf
though
they
may
hear
and
amongst
the
blind
though
they
may
see
as
hath
been
clearly
stated
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
the
day
of
reckoning
hearts
have
they
with
which
they
understand
not
and
eyes
have
they
with
which
they
see
not
they
walk
the
edge
of
a
treacherous
bank
and
tread
the
brink
of
a
fiery
abyss
they
partake
not
of
the
billows
of
this
surging
and
ocean
but
disport
themselves
with
their
own
idle
words
in
this
connection
we
will
relate
unto
thee
that
which
was
revealed
of
old
concerning
life
that
perchance
it
may
turn
thee
away
from
the
promptings
of
self
deliver
thee
from
the
narrow
confines
of
thy
prison
in
this
gloomy
plane
and
aid
thee
to
become
of
them
that
are
guided
aright
in
the
darkness
of
this
world
he
saith
and
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
shall
the
dead
whom
we
have
quickened
and
for
whom
we
have
ordained
a
light
whereby
he
may
walk
amongst
men
be
like
him
whose
likeness
is
in
the
darkness
whence
he
will
not
come
forth
this
verse
was
revealed
with
respect
to
ḥamzih
and
the
former
of
whom
was
a
believer
whilst
the
latter
disbelieved
most
of
the
pagan
leaders
mocked
and
derided
it
were
agitated
and
clamoured
how
did
ḥamzih
die
and
how
was
he
restored
to
his
former
life
were
ye
to
examine
carefully
the
verses
of
god
ye
would
find
many
such
statements
recorded
in
the
book
would
that
pure
and
stainless
hearts
could
be
found
that
i
might
impart
unto
them
a
sprinkling
from
the
oceans
of
knowledge
which
my
lord
hath
bestowed
upon
me
so
that
they
may
soar
in
the
heavens
even
as
they
walk
upon
the
earth
and
speed
over
the
waters
even
as
they
course
the
land
and
that
they
may
take
up
their
souls
in
their
hands
and
lay
them
down
in
the
path
of
their
creator
howbeit
leave
hath
not
been
granted
to
divulge
this
mighty
secret
indeed
it
hath
been
from
everlasting
a
mystery
enshrined
within
the
treasuries
of
his
power
and
a
secret
concealed
within
the
repositories
of
his
might
lest
his
faithful
servants
forsake
their
own
lives
in
the
hope
of
attaining
this
most
great
station
in
the
realms
of
eternity
nor
shall
they
who
wander
in
this
oppressive
darkness
ever
attain
unto
it
o
my
brother
at
every
juncture
we
have
restated
our
theme
that
all
that
hath
been
recorded
in
these
verses
may
by
the
leave
of
god
be
made
clear
unto
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
become
independent
of
those
who
are
plunged
in
the
darkness
of
self
and
who
tread
the
valley
of
arrogance
and
pride
and
be
of
them
that
move
within
the
paradise
of
everlasting
life
say
o
people
the
tree
of
life
hath
verily
been
planted
in
the
heart
of
the
heavenly
paradise
and
bestoweth
life
in
every
direction
how
can
ye
fail
to
perceive
and
recognize
it
it
will
in
truth
aid
thee
to
grasp
all
that
this
soul
hath
disclosed
unto
thee
of
the
essence
of
the
divine
mysteries
the
dove
of
holiness
warbleth
in
the
heaven
of
immortality
and
admonisheth
thee
to
array
thyself
with
a
new
vesture
wrought
of
steel
to
shield
thee
from
the
shafts
of
doubt
concealed
in
the
allusions
of
men
saying
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
which
is
born
of
the
spirit
is
spirit
marvel
not
that
i
said
unto
thee
ye
must
be
born
wing
then
thy
flight
unto
this
divine
tree
and
partake
of
its
fruits
gather
up
that
which
hath
fallen
therefrom
and
guard
it
faithfully
meditate
then
upon
the
utterance
of
one
of
the
prophets
as
he
intimated
to
the
souls
of
men
through
veiled
allusions
and
hidden
symbols
the
of
the
one
who
was
to
come
after
him
that
thou
mayest
know
of
a
certainty
that
their
words
are
inscrutable
to
all
save
those
who
are
endued
with
an
understanding
heart
he
saith
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
were
his
feet
and
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
sword
how
could
these
words
be
literally
interpreted
were
anyone
to
appear
with
all
these
signs
he
would
assuredly
not
be
human
and
how
could
any
soul
seek
his
company
nay
should
he
appear
in
one
city
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
next
would
flee
from
him
nor
would
any
soul
dare
approach
him
yet
shouldst
thou
reflect
upon
these
statements
thou
wouldst
find
them
to
be
of
such
surpassing
eloquence
and
clarity
as
to
mark
the
loftiest
heights
of
utterance
and
the
epitome
of
wisdom
methinks
it
is
from
them
that
the
suns
of
eloquence
have
appeared
and
the
stars
of
clarity
have
dawned
forth
and
shone
resplendent
behold
then
the
foolish
ones
of
bygone
times
and
those
who
in
this
day
await
the
advent
of
such
a
being
nor
would
they
ever
bear
allegiance
unto
him
except
that
he
appear
in
the
aforementioned
form
and
as
such
a
being
will
never
appear
so
too
will
they
never
believe
such
indeed
is
the
measure
of
the
understanding
of
these
perverse
and
ungodly
souls
how
could
those
who
fail
to
understand
the
most
evident
of
the
evident
and
the
most
manifest
of
the
manifest
ever
apprehend
the
abstruse
realities
of
the
divine
precepts
and
the
essence
of
the
mysteries
of
his
everlasting
wisdom
i
shall
now
briefly
explain
the
true
meaning
of
this
utterance
that
thou
mayest
discover
its
hidden
mysteries
and
be
of
them
that
perceive
examine
then
and
judge
aright
that
which
we
shall
reveal
unto
thee
that
haply
thou
mayest
be
accounted
in
the
sight
of
god
amongst
those
who
are
in
these
matters
know
then
that
he
who
uttered
these
words
in
the
realms
of
glory
meant
to
describe
the
attributes
of
the
one
who
is
to
come
in
such
veiled
and
enigmatic
terms
as
to
elude
the
understanding
of
the
people
of
error
now
when
he
saith
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
he
alludeth
but
to
the
keenness
of
sight
and
acuteness
of
vision
of
the
promised
one
who
with
his
eyes
burneth
away
every
veil
and
covering
maketh
known
the
eternal
mysteries
in
the
contingent
world
and
distinguisheth
the
faces
that
are
obscured
with
the
dust
of
hell
from
those
that
shine
with
the
light
of
paradise
were
his
eyes
not
made
of
the
blazing
fire
of
god
how
could
he
consume
every
veil
and
burn
away
all
that
the
people
possess
how
could
he
behold
the
signs
of
god
in
the
kingdom
of
his
names
and
in
the
world
of
creation
how
could
he
see
all
things
with
the
eye
of
god
thus
have
we
conferred
upon
him
a
penetrating
vision
in
this
day
would
that
ye
believe
in
the
verses
of
god
for
indeed
what
fire
is
fiercer
than
this
flame
that
shineth
in
the
sinai
of
his
eyes
whereby
he
consumeth
all
that
hath
veiled
the
peoples
of
the
world
immeasurably
exalted
shall
god
remain
above
all
that
hath
been
revealed
in
his
unerring
tablets
concerning
the
mysteries
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
until
that
day
when
the
crier
will
cry
out
the
day
whereon
we
shall
all
return
unto
him
as
to
the
words
were
his
feet
by
this
is
meant
his
constancy
upon
hearing
the
call
of
god
that
commandeth
him
be
thou
steadfast
as
thou
hast
been
he
shall
so
persevere
in
the
cause
of
god
and
evince
such
firmness
in
the
path
of
his
might
that
even
if
all
the
powers
of
earth
and
heaven
were
to
deny
him
he
would
not
waver
in
the
proclamation
of
his
cause
nor
flee
from
his
command
in
the
promulgation
of
his
laws
nay
rather
he
will
stand
as
firm
as
the
highest
mountains
and
the
loftiest
peaks
he
will
remain
immovable
in
his
obedience
to
god
and
steadfast
in
revealing
his
cause
and
proclaiming
his
word
no
obstacle
will
hinder
him
nor
will
the
censure
of
the
froward
deter
him
or
the
repudiation
of
the
infidels
cause
him
to
waver
all
the
hatred
the
rejection
the
iniquity
and
the
unbelief
that
he
witnesseth
serve
but
to
strengthen
his
love
for
god
to
augment
the
yearning
of
his
heart
to
heighten
the
exultation
of
his
soul
and
to
fill
his
breast
with
passionate
devotion
hast
thou
ever
seen
in
this
world
brass
stronger
or
blade
sharper
or
mountain
more
unyielding
than
this
he
shall
verily
stand
upon
his
feet
to
confront
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
will
fear
no
one
notwithstanding
that
which
as
thou
well
knowest
the
people
are
wont
to
commit
glory
be
to
god
who
hath
established
him
and
called
him
forth
potent
is
god
to
do
what
he
pleaseth
he
in
truth
is
the
help
in
peril
the
and
further
he
saith
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
know
thou
that
since
the
sword
is
an
instrument
that
divideth
and
cleaveth
asunder
and
since
there
proceedeth
from
the
mouth
of
the
prophets
and
the
chosen
ones
of
god
that
which
separateth
the
believer
from
the
infidel
and
the
lover
from
the
beloved
this
term
hath
been
so
employed
and
apart
from
this
dividing
and
separating
no
other
meaning
is
intended
thus
when
he
who
is
the
primal
point
and
the
eternal
sun
desireth
by
the
leave
of
god
to
gather
together
all
creation
to
raise
them
up
from
the
graves
of
their
own
selves
and
to
divide
them
one
from
another
he
shall
pronounce
but
one
verse
from
him
and
this
verse
will
distinguish
truth
from
error
from
this
day
unto
the
day
of
resurrection
what
sword
is
sharper
than
this
heavenly
sword
what
blade
more
trenchant
than
this
incorruptible
steel
that
severeth
every
tie
and
separateth
thereby
the
believer
from
the
infidel
father
from
son
brother
from
sister
and
lover
from
beloved
for
whoso
believeth
in
that
which
hath
been
revealed
unto
him
is
a
true
believer
and
whoso
turneth
away
is
an
infidel
and
such
an
irrevocable
separation
occurreth
between
them
that
they
will
cease
to
consort
and
associate
with
each
other
in
this
world
and
so
it
is
between
father
and
son
for
should
the
son
believe
and
the
father
deny
they
will
be
severed
and
forever
dissociated
from
each
other
nay
rather
thou
witnesseth
how
the
son
slayeth
the
father
and
the
father
the
son
consider
in
the
same
light
all
that
we
have
explained
and
related
unto
thee
wert
thou
to
behold
all
things
with
the
eye
of
discernment
thou
wouldst
indeed
see
that
this
divine
sword
doth
cleave
asunder
generations
would
that
ye
could
understand
it
all
this
is
by
virtue
of
the
word
of
separation
that
is
manifested
on
the
day
of
judgement
and
separation
were
the
people
to
take
heed
in
the
days
of
their
lord
nay
couldst
thou
but
sharpen
thy
sight
and
refine
thy
heart
thou
wouldst
witness
that
all
the
material
swords
which
in
every
day
and
age
have
slain
the
infidels
and
waged
war
against
the
impious
proceed
from
this
divine
and
invisible
sword
open
then
thine
eyes
that
thou
mayest
behold
all
that
we
have
revealed
to
thee
and
attain
unto
that
which
none
other
hath
attained
we
verily
exclaim
praise
be
to
god
he
who
is
the
lord
of
the
day
of
reckoning
yea
inasmuch
as
these
people
have
failed
to
acquire
true
knowledge
from
its
source
and
wellspring
and
from
the
ocean
of
fresh
and
waters
that
stream
by
the
leave
of
god
through
hearts
that
are
pure
and
stainless
they
have
been
veiled
from
that
which
god
hath
intended
by
those
words
and
allusions
and
have
remained
confined
within
the
prison
of
their
own
selves
we
render
thanks
unto
god
for
that
which
he
hath
bestowed
upon
us
of
his
grace
he
it
is
who
hath
caused
us
to
be
assured
of
the
truth
of
his
faith
which
the
combined
forces
of
earth
and
heaven
are
powerless
to
resist
he
it
is
who
hath
enabled
us
to
acknowledge
him
in
the
day
of
his
presence
to
testify
unto
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
in
the
latter
resurrection
and
to
be
among
them
that
have
believed
in
him
ere
his
appearance
that
his
favour
may
be
made
complete
unto
us
and
unto
all
mankind
but
hear
o
my
brother
my
plaint
against
them
that
claim
to
be
associated
with
god
and
with
the
manifestations
of
his
knowledge
and
yet
follow
their
corrupt
inclinations
consume
the
substance
of
their
neighbour
are
given
to
wine
commit
murder
defraud
and
slander
each
other
hurl
calumnies
against
god
and
are
wont
to
speak
falsely
the
people
attribute
all
these
deeds
unto
us
whilst
their
perpetrators
remain
shameless
before
god
they
cast
aside
that
which
he
hath
enjoined
upon
them
and
commit
that
which
he
hath
forbidden
yet
it
behoveth
the
people
of
truth
that
the
signs
of
humility
should
shine
upon
their
faces
that
the
light
of
sanctity
should
radiate
from
their
countenances
that
they
should
walk
upon
the
earth
as
though
they
were
in
the
presence
of
god
and
distinguish
themselves
in
their
deeds
from
all
the
dwellers
of
the
earth
such
must
be
their
state
that
their
eyes
should
behold
the
evidences
of
his
might
their
tongues
and
hearts
make
mention
of
his
name
their
feet
be
set
towards
the
lands
of
his
nearness
and
their
hands
take
fast
hold
upon
his
precepts
and
were
they
to
pass
through
a
valley
of
pure
gold
and
mines
of
precious
silver
they
should
regard
them
as
wholly
unworthy
of
their
attention
these
people
however
have
turned
aside
from
all
this
and
placed
instead
their
affections
upon
that
which
accordeth
with
their
own
corrupt
inclinations
thus
do
they
roam
in
the
wilderness
of
arrogance
and
pride
i
bear
witness
at
this
moment
that
god
is
wholly
quit
of
them
and
likewise
are
we
we
beseech
god
to
suffer
us
not
to
associate
with
them
either
in
this
life
or
in
the
life
to
come
he
verily
is
the
eternal
truth
no
god
is
there
but
him
and
his
might
is
equal
to
all
things
quaff
then
o
my
brother
from
the
living
waters
that
we
have
caused
to
flow
in
the
oceans
of
these
words
methinks
the
seas
of
grandeur
are
surging
within
them
and
the
gems
of
divine
virtue
are
shining
within
and
upon
them
divest
then
thyself
of
that
which
debarreth
thee
from
this
fathomless
crimson
sea
and
to
the
cry
of
in
the
name
of
god
and
by
his
grace
immerse
thyself
therein
let
the
fear
of
no
one
dismay
thee
trust
in
the
lord
thy
god
for
he
is
sufficient
unto
whosoever
trusteth
in
him
he
verily
shall
protect
thee
and
in
him
shalt
thou
abide
in
safety
know
thou
moreover
that
in
this
most
hallowed
and
resplendent
city
thou
shalt
find
the
wayfarer
to
be
lowly
before
all
men
and
humble
before
all
things
for
naught
doth
he
behold
save
that
he
perceiveth
god
therein
he
beholdeth
the
effulgent
glories
of
god
in
the
lights
of
his
revelation
that
have
encompassed
the
sinai
of
creation
in
this
station
the
wayfarer
must
not
claim
the
seat
of
honour
in
any
gathering
or
walk
before
others
in
the
desire
to
vaunt
and
exalt
himself
rather
must
he
regard
himself
as
standing
at
all
times
in
the
presence
of
his
lord
he
must
not
wish
for
anyone
that
which
he
doth
not
wish
for
himself
nor
speak
that
which
he
would
not
bear
to
hear
spoken
by
another
nor
yet
desire
for
any
soul
that
which
he
would
not
have
desired
for
himself
it
befitteth
him
rather
to
walk
upon
the
earth
with
undeviating
steps
in
the
kingdom
of
his
new
creation
know
however
that
the
seeker
at
the
outset
of
his
journey
witnesseth
change
and
transformation
as
hath
already
been
mentioned
this
is
undoubtedly
the
truth
as
hath
been
revealed
concerning
those
days
on
the
day
when
the
earth
shall
be
changed
into
another
these
are
indeed
days
the
like
of
which
no
mortal
eye
hath
ever
seen
blessed
is
he
that
attaineth
thereunto
and
realizeth
their
full
worth
we
had
sent
moses
with
our
signs
saying
unto
him
bring
forth
thy
people
from
darkness
into
light
and
remind
them
of
the
days
of
and
these
are
in
truth
the
days
of
god
could
ye
but
know
it
in
this
station
all
changing
and
varying
realities
are
manifest
before
thee
whosoever
denieth
this
truth
hath
verily
turned
aside
from
the
cause
of
god
rebelled
against
his
rule
and
gainsaid
his
sovereignty
for
it
is
indeed
within
the
power
of
him
who
changeth
the
earth
into
another
earth
to
transform
all
that
dwell
and
move
thereon
wherefore
marvel
not
at
how
he
turneth
darkness
into
light
light
into
darkness
ignorance
into
knowledge
error
into
guidance
death
into
life
and
life
into
death
it
is
in
this
station
that
the
law
of
transformation
taketh
effect
ponder
thereon
if
thou
be
of
them
that
tread
this
path
that
all
thou
didst
ask
of
this
owly
one
may
be
made
plain
unto
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
abide
within
the
tabernacle
of
this
guidance
for
he
doeth
whatsoever
he
willeth
and
ordaineth
whatsoever
he
pleaseth
nor
shall
he
be
asked
of
his
doings
whilst
all
men
will
be
asked
of
their
every
deed
o
my
brother
in
this
stage
which
marketh
the
beginning
of
the
journey
thou
shalt
behold
divers
stations
and
differing
signs
even
as
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
city
of
search
all
these
hold
true
in
their
respective
planes
it
behoveth
thine
eminence
in
this
station
to
consider
each
created
thing
in
its
own
place
neither
abasing
nor
exalting
its
true
rank
for
instance
if
thou
wert
to
reduce
the
unseen
world
to
the
realm
of
creation
this
would
be
an
act
of
sheer
blasphemy
and
the
converse
would
likewise
be
the
essence
of
impiety
wert
thou
however
to
describe
the
unseen
world
and
the
realm
of
creation
within
their
own
stations
this
would
be
the
undoubted
truth
in
other
words
wert
thou
to
witness
any
transformation
in
the
realm
of
the
divine
unity
no
greater
sin
could
be
conceived
in
all
creation
but
wert
thou
to
consider
transformation
in
its
own
place
and
understand
it
accordingly
no
harm
could
befall
thee
by
my
lord
notwithstanding
all
that
we
have
revealed
unto
thee
of
the
mysteries
of
utterance
and
the
degrees
of
exposition
methinks
i
have
spoken
not
a
single
letter
of
the
ocean
of
god
s
hidden
knowledge
and
the
essence
of
his
inscrutable
wisdom
god
willing
this
we
shall
erelong
accomplish
in
its
appointed
time
he
verily
remembereth
all
things
in
their
own
place
and
we
in
truth
all
yield
praise
unto
him
know
thou
moreover
that
the
bird
that
taketh
flight
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
realm
on
high
will
never
be
able
to
soar
unto
the
heaven
of
transcendent
holiness
nor
taste
of
the
fruits
which
god
hath
brought
forth
therein
nor
quaff
from
the
streams
which
he
hath
caused
to
flow
in
its
midst
and
were
it
to
partake
but
a
drop
thereof
it
would
perish
forthwith
even
as
thou
dost
witness
in
these
days
with
regard
to
those
who
profess
allegiance
unto
us
and
yet
perform
such
deeds
utter
such
words
and
advance
such
claims
as
they
have
methinks
they
lie
as
dead
within
their
own
veils
comprehend
in
like
manner
every
station
sign
and
allusion
that
thou
mayest
perceive
all
things
in
their
own
place
and
consider
all
matters
in
their
proper
light
for
in
this
station
the
city
of
divine
unity
are
to
be
found
those
who
have
entered
within
the
ark
of
divine
guidance
and
journeyed
through
the
heights
of
divine
unity
thou
shalt
behold
the
lights
of
beauty
upon
their
faces
and
the
mysteries
of
glory
in
their
human
temples
thou
shalt
perceive
the
fragrance
of
their
words
and
behold
the
signs
of
his
sovereignty
in
all
their
ways
and
doings
nor
wilt
thou
be
veiled
by
the
deeds
of
them
that
have
failed
to
quaff
from
the
crystal
springs
or
to
attain
unto
the
cities
of
holiness
and
who
follow
their
selfish
desires
and
spread
disorder
in
the
land
all
the
while
believing
themselves
to
be
guided
aright
it
is
indeed
of
them
that
it
hath
been
said
these
are
the
abject
and
foolish
who
follow
every
clamorous
impostor
and
who
bend
with
every
changing
the
stages
of
this
journey
station
and
abode
are
clear
and
manifest
to
thee
and
require
no
further
explanation
know
then
that
all
thou
hast
heard
and
witnessed
that
daystar
of
truth
the
primal
point
ascribe
to
himself
from
the
designations
of
former
times
is
only
on
account
of
the
weakness
of
men
and
the
scheme
of
the
world
of
creation
otherwise
all
names
and
attributes
revolve
round
his
essence
and
circle
about
the
threshold
of
his
sanctuary
for
he
it
is
who
traineth
all
names
revealeth
all
attributes
conferreth
life
upon
all
beings
proclaimeth
the
divine
verses
and
arrayeth
the
heavenly
signs
nay
shouldst
thou
gaze
with
thine
inner
eye
thou
wouldst
find
that
all
save
him
fade
into
utter
nothingness
and
are
as
a
thing
forgotten
in
his
holy
presence
god
was
alone
there
was
none
else
besides
him
he
remaineth
now
what
he
hath
ever
since
it
hath
been
established
that
and
glorified
be
he
alone
and
there
was
none
besides
him
how
can
the
law
of
change
and
transformation
apply
here
shouldst
thou
reflect
upon
that
which
we
have
disclosed
unto
thee
the
daystar
of
guidance
would
shine
resplendent
before
thee
in
this
everlasting
morn
and
thou
wouldst
be
numbered
therein
with
the
pious
know
moreover
that
all
that
we
have
mentioned
concerning
these
journeys
is
intended
for
none
but
the
elect
amongst
the
righteous
and
shouldst
thou
spur
on
the
charger
of
the
spirit
and
traverse
the
meads
of
heaven
thou
wouldst
complete
all
these
journeys
and
discover
every
mystery
in
less
than
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
o
my
brother
if
thou
be
a
champion
of
this
arena
speed
within
the
lands
of
certitude
that
thy
soul
may
be
delivered
in
this
day
from
the
bondage
of
misbelief
and
that
thou
mayest
perceive
the
sweet
savours
that
waft
from
this
garden
verily
the
breezes
that
carry
the
fragrance
of
this
city
blow
over
all
regions
forfeit
not
thy
portion
thereof
and
be
not
of
the
heedless
how
well
hath
it
been
said
his
fragrant
breaths
diffused
in
eastern
lands
could
well
to
sick
ones
in
the
west
restore
their
sense
of
smell
after
this
heavenly
journey
and
mystical
ascent
the
wayfarer
will
enter
within
the
garden
of
wonderment
were
i
to
disclose
unto
thee
the
reality
of
this
station
thou
wouldst
lament
and
bewail
the
plight
of
this
servant
who
remaineth
in
the
hands
of
these
infidels
who
hath
grown
perplexed
at
his
plight
and
is
lost
in
bewilderment
in
this
fathomless
ocean
they
conspire
each
day
to
put
me
to
death
and
seek
at
every
hour
to
banish
me
from
this
land
even
as
they
banished
me
from
another
land
yet
this
servant
standeth
ready
before
them
awaiting
whatsoever
the
almighty
hath
ordained
and
decreed
for
us
nor
do
i
fear
any
soul
encompassed
as
we
may
be
by
such
trials
and
tribulations
as
are
inflicted
by
the
wicked
and
the
malicious
and
surrounded
at
this
hour
by
a
myriad
woes
and
sorrows
noah
s
flood
is
but
the
measure
of
the
tears
i
have
shed
and
abraham
s
fire
an
ebullition
of
my
soul
jacob
s
grief
is
but
a
reflection
of
my
sorrows
and
job
s
afflictions
a
fraction
of
my
were
i
to
recount
unto
thine
eminence
the
dire
adversities
that
have
befallen
me
thou
wouldst
be
so
grieved
as
to
forsake
the
mention
of
all
things
and
to
forget
thyself
and
all
that
the
lord
hath
created
on
earth
but
as
this
is
not
our
wish
i
have
concealed
the
revelation
of
the
divine
decree
in
the
heart
of
bahá
and
veiled
it
from
the
eyes
of
all
that
move
in
the
realm
of
creation
that
it
may
lay
hid
within
the
tabernacle
of
the
unseen
until
such
time
as
god
will
have
revealed
its
secret
naught
in
the
heavens
or
on
the
earth
can
escape
his
knowledge
and
he
verily
perceiveth
all
as
we
have
digressed
from
our
theme
let
us
leave
aside
these
allusions
and
return
to
our
discussion
of
this
city
verily
whoso
entereth
therein
shall
be
saved
and
whoso
turneth
aside
therefrom
will
assuredly
perish
o
thou
who
art
mentioned
in
these
tablets
know
thou
that
he
who
embarketh
upon
this
journey
will
marvel
at
the
signs
of
the
power
of
god
and
the
wondrous
evidences
of
his
handiwork
bewilderment
will
seize
him
from
every
side
even
as
hath
been
attested
by
that
essence
of
immortality
from
the
concourse
on
high
increase
my
wonder
and
amazement
at
thee
o
god
well
hath
it
been
said
i
knew
not
what
amazement
was
until
i
made
thy
love
my
cause
o
how
amazing
would
it
be
if
i
were
not
amazed
by
thee
in
this
valley
the
wayfarers
stray
and
perish
ere
they
attain
their
final
abode
gracious
god
so
immense
is
this
valley
so
vast
this
city
in
the
kingdom
of
creation
that
it
seemeth
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
how
great
the
blessedness
of
him
who
completeth
his
journey
therein
and
who
traverseth
through
the
assistance
of
god
the
hallowed
soil
of
this
heavenly
city
a
city
in
which
the
favoured
ones
of
god
and
the
pure
in
heart
are
overcome
with
wonder
and
awe
and
we
say
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
the
and
should
the
servant
ascend
to
even
loftier
heights
quit
this
mortal
world
of
dust
and
seek
to
ascend
unto
the
celestial
abode
he
will
then
pass
from
this
city
into
the
city
of
absolute
nothingness
that
is
of
dying
to
self
and
living
in
god
in
this
station
this
most
exalted
habitation
this
journey
of
utter
the
wayfarer
forgetteth
his
soul
spirit
body
and
very
being
immerseth
himself
in
the
sea
of
nothingness
and
liveth
on
earth
as
one
unworthy
of
mention
nor
will
one
find
any
sign
of
his
existence
for
he
hath
vanished
from
the
realm
of
the
visible
and
attained
unto
the
heights
of
were
we
to
recount
the
mysteries
of
this
city
the
dominions
of
the
hearts
of
men
would
be
laid
to
waste
in
the
intensity
of
their
longing
for
this
mighty
station
for
this
is
the
station
wherein
the
effulgent
glories
of
the
beloved
are
revealed
to
the
sincere
lover
and
the
resplendent
lights
of
the
friend
are
cast
upon
the
severed
heart
that
is
devoted
to
him
how
can
a
true
lover
continue
to
exist
when
once
the
effulgent
glories
of
the
beloved
are
revealed
how
can
the
shadow
endure
when
once
the
sun
hath
shone
forth
how
can
a
devoted
heart
have
any
being
before
the
existence
of
the
object
of
its
devotion
nay
by
the
one
in
whose
hand
is
my
soul
in
this
station
the
seeker
s
complete
surrender
and
utter
effacement
before
his
creator
will
be
such
that
were
he
to
search
the
east
and
the
west
and
traverse
land
sea
mountain
and
plain
he
would
find
no
trace
of
his
own
self
or
of
any
other
soul
gracious
god
but
for
fear
of
the
nimrod
of
tyranny
and
for
the
protection
of
the
abraham
of
justice
i
would
reveal
unto
thee
that
which
wert
thou
to
abandon
self
and
desire
would
enable
thee
to
dispense
with
aught
else
and
to
draw
nigh
unto
this
city
be
patient
however
until
such
time
as
god
will
have
proclaimed
his
cause
he
verily
rewardeth
beyond
measure
them
that
endure
with
patience
inhale
then
the
sweet
savours
of
the
spirit
from
the
garment
of
hidden
meanings
and
say
o
ye
that
are
immersed
in
the
ocean
of
selflessness
hasten
to
enter
the
city
of
immortality
if
ye
seek
to
ascend
its
and
we
exclaim
verily
we
are
god
s
and
to
him
shall
we
from
this
most
august
and
exalted
station
and
from
this
most
sublime
and
glorious
plane
the
seeker
entereth
the
city
of
immortality
therein
to
abide
forever
in
this
station
he
beholdeth
himself
established
upon
the
throne
of
independence
and
the
seat
of
exaltation
then
will
he
comprehend
the
meaning
of
that
which
hath
been
revealed
of
old
concerning
the
day
whereon
god
shall
enrich
all
through
his
abundance
well
is
it
with
them
that
have
attained
unto
this
station
and
drunk
their
fill
from
this
chalice
before
this
crimson
pillar
having
in
this
journey
immersed
himself
in
the
ocean
of
immortality
rid
his
heart
from
attachment
to
aught
save
him
and
attained
unto
the
loftiest
heights
of
everlasting
life
the
seeker
will
see
no
annihilation
either
for
himself
or
for
any
other
soul
he
will
quaff
from
the
cup
of
immortality
tread
in
its
land
soar
in
its
atmosphere
consort
with
them
that
are
its
embodiments
partake
of
the
imperishable
and
incorruptible
fruits
of
the
tree
of
eternity
and
be
forever
accounted
in
the
lofty
heights
of
immortality
amongst
the
denizens
of
the
everlasting
realm
all
that
existeth
in
this
city
shall
indeed
endure
and
will
never
perish
shouldst
thou
by
the
leave
of
god
enter
this
sublime
and
exalted
garden
thou
wouldst
find
its
sun
in
its
noontide
glory
never
to
set
never
to
be
eclipsed
the
same
holdeth
true
of
its
moon
its
firmament
its
stars
trees
and
oceans
and
of
all
that
pertaineth
thereunto
or
existeth
therein
by
him
besides
whom
there
is
none
other
god
were
i
to
recount
from
this
day
unto
the
end
that
hath
no
end
its
wondrous
attributes
the
love
that
my
heart
cherisheth
for
this
hallowed
and
everlasting
city
would
never
be
exhausted
i
shall
however
bring
my
theme
to
a
close
since
time
is
short
and
the
inquirer
impatient
and
since
these
secrets
are
not
to
be
openly
divulged
save
by
the
leave
of
god
the
almighty
the
erelong
shall
the
faithful
behold
in
the
day
of
the
latter
resurrection
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
descending
with
this
city
from
the
heaven
of
the
unseen
together
with
a
company
of
his
exalted
and
favoured
angels
great
therefore
is
the
blessedness
of
him
that
attaineth
unto
his
presence
and
beholdeth
his
countenance
we
all
verily
cherish
this
hope
and
exclaim
praise
be
unto
him
for
verily
he
is
the
eternal
truth
and
unto
him
do
we
return
know
moreover
that
should
one
who
hath
attained
unto
these
stations
and
embarked
upon
these
journeys
fall
prey
to
pride
and
vainglory
he
would
at
that
very
moment
come
to
naught
and
return
to
the
first
step
without
realizing
it
indeed
they
that
seek
and
yearn
after
him
in
these
journeys
are
known
by
this
sign
that
they
humbly
defer
to
those
who
have
believed
in
god
and
in
his
verses
that
they
are
lowly
before
those
who
have
drawn
nigh
unto
him
and
unto
the
manifestations
of
his
beauty
and
that
they
bow
in
submission
to
them
that
are
firmly
established
upon
the
lofty
heights
of
the
cause
of
god
and
before
its
majesty
for
were
they
to
reach
the
ultimate
object
of
their
quest
for
god
and
their
attainment
unto
him
they
would
have
but
reached
that
abode
which
hath
been
raised
up
within
their
own
hearts
how
then
could
they
ever
hope
to
ascend
unto
such
realms
as
have
not
been
ordained
for
them
or
created
for
their
station
nay
though
they
journey
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
they
will
never
attain
unto
him
who
is
the
midmost
heart
of
existence
and
the
axis
of
the
entire
creation
he
on
whose
right
hand
flow
the
seas
of
grandeur
on
whose
left
stream
the
rivers
of
might
and
whose
court
none
can
ever
hope
to
reach
how
much
less
his
very
abode
for
he
dwelleth
in
the
ark
of
fire
speedeth
in
the
sphere
of
fire
through
the
ocean
of
fire
and
moveth
within
the
atmosphere
of
fire
how
can
he
who
hath
been
fashioned
of
contrary
elements
ever
enter
or
even
approach
this
fire
were
he
to
do
so
he
would
be
instantly
consumed
know
moreover
that
should
the
cord
of
assistance
binding
this
mighty
pivot
to
the
dwellers
of
earth
and
heaven
be
severed
they
would
all
assuredly
perish
great
god
how
can
the
lowly
dust
ever
reach
unto
him
who
is
the
lord
of
lords
immeasurably
exalted
is
god
above
that
which
they
conceive
in
their
hearts
and
immensely
glorified
is
he
beyond
that
which
they
attribute
to
him
yea
the
seeker
reacheth
a
station
wherein
that
which
hath
been
ordained
for
him
knoweth
no
bounds
the
fire
of
love
so
blazeth
in
his
heart
that
it
seizeth
the
reins
of
constraint
from
his
grasp
at
every
moment
his
love
for
his
lord
increaseth
and
draweth
him
nearer
unto
his
creator
in
such
wise
that
if
his
lord
be
in
the
east
of
nearness
and
he
dwell
in
the
west
of
remoteness
and
possess
all
that
earth
and
heaven
contain
of
rubies
and
gold
he
would
forsake
it
all
and
rush
forth
to
the
land
of
the
desired
one
and
shouldst
thou
find
him
to
be
otherwise
know
assuredly
that
such
a
man
is
a
lying
impostor
we
verily
all
belong
unto
him
whom
god
shall
make
manifest
in
the
latter
resurrection
and
through
him
shall
we
be
raised
again
to
life
in
these
days
inasmuch
as
we
have
lifted
not
the
veils
that
conceal
the
countenance
of
the
cause
of
god
nor
disclosed
unto
men
the
fruits
of
these
stations
which
we
have
been
forbidden
to
describe
thou
beholdest
them
drunk
with
heedlessness
otherwise
were
the
glory
of
this
station
to
be
revealed
unto
men
to
an
extent
smaller
than
a
needle
s
eye
thou
wouldst
witness
them
gathering
before
the
threshold
of
divine
mercy
and
hastening
from
all
sides
to
the
court
of
nearness
in
the
realms
of
divine
glory
we
have
concealed
it
however
as
mentioned
before
that
those
who
believe
may
be
distinguished
from
them
that
deny
and
that
those
who
turn
unto
god
may
be
discerned
from
them
that
turn
aside
i
verily
proclaim
there
is
no
power
nor
strength
except
in
god
the
help
in
peril
the
from
this
station
the
wayfarer
ascendeth
unto
a
city
that
hath
no
name
or
description
and
whereof
one
heareth
neither
sound
nor
mention
therein
flow
the
oceans
of
eternity
whilst
this
city
itself
revolveth
round
the
seat
of
eternity
therein
the
sun
of
the
unseen
shineth
resplendent
above
the
horizon
of
the
unseen
a
sun
that
hath
its
own
heavens
and
its
own
moons
which
partake
of
its
light
and
which
rise
from
and
set
upon
the
ocean
of
the
unseen
nor
can
i
ever
hope
to
impart
even
a
dewdrop
of
that
which
hath
been
decreed
therein
as
none
is
acquainted
with
its
mysteries
save
god
its
creator
and
fashioner
and
his
manifestations
know
moreover
that
when
we
undertook
to
reveal
these
words
and
committed
some
of
them
to
writing
it
was
our
intention
to
elucidate
for
thine
eminence
in
the
sweet
accents
of
the
blessed
and
the
of
god
all
that
we
had
previously
mentioned
of
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
the
sayings
of
the
messengers
time
however
was
lacking
and
the
traveller
who
came
from
thy
presence
was
in
great
haste
and
eager
to
return
thus
have
we
cut
short
our
discourse
and
contented
ourself
with
this
much
without
completing
the
description
of
these
stages
in
a
seemly
and
befitting
manner
indeed
we
have
omitted
the
description
of
major
cities
and
mighty
journeys
such
was
the
haste
of
the
courier
that
we
even
forsook
the
mention
of
the
two
exalted
journeys
of
resignation
and
contentment
yet
should
thine
eminence
reflect
upon
these
brief
statements
thou
wouldst
assuredly
acquire
every
knowledge
attain
unto
the
object
of
all
learning
and
exclaim
sufficient
are
these
words
unto
all
creation
both
visible
and
invisible
even
so
should
the
fire
of
love
burn
within
thy
soul
thou
wouldst
ask
is
there
yet
any
more
and
we
say
praise
be
to
god
the
lord
of
the
worlds
