eve
when
peggy
deutchland
woke
from
her
wooden
sleep
on
the
counter
steep
and
to
her
neighbour
spoke
get
up
get
up
dear
sarah
jane
now
strikes
the
midnight
hour
when
dolls
and
toys
taste
human
joys
and
revel
in
their
power
illustration
i
long
to
try
my
limbs
a
bit
and
you
must
walk
with
me
our
joints
are
good
though
made
of
wood
and
i
pine
for
liberty
illustration
for
twelve
long
months
we
lain
in
here
but
we
do
care
a
fig
when
wide
awake
it
does
not
take
us
long
to
dance
a
jig
illustration
but
who
comes
here
across
our
path
in
gay
attire
bedight
a
little
girl
with
hair
in
curl
and
eyes
so
round
and
bright
illustration
good
evening
miss
how
fine
you
look
beside
you
i
feel
bare
i
must
confess
i
need
a
dress
if
i
would
look
as
fair
illustration
on
that
high
pole
i
see
a
flag
with
colors
red
and
blue
dear
sarah
jane
is
very
plain
a
climb
you
have
to
do
illustration
you
young
and
light
so
now
be
quick
dear
sister
good
and
kind
you
look
dismayed
do
be
afraid
it
not
so
hard
you
find
then
up
the
pole
with
trembling
limbs
poor
sarah
jane
did
mount
she
dared
not
lag
but
seized
the
flag
ere
you
could
twenty
count
big
peggy
gazed
with
deep
concern
and
mouth
wide
open
too
her
only
care
that
she
might
wear
a
gown
of
brilliant
hue
illustration
illustration
now
peg
by
instinct
seemed
to
know
where
scissors
might
be
got
the
fits
were
bad
but
then
she
had
no
patterns
on
the
spot
soon
where
the
garments
hurried
on
sarah
looked
well
in
blue
mirror
in
hand
she
took
her
stand
while
peggy
pinned
her
through
illustration
illustration
said
peggy
after
work
so
hard
i
think
a
rest
we
need
let
take
a
ride
seated
astride
upon
this
gentle
steed
then
simple
sarah
jane
climbed
up
upon
his
wooden
back
with
heart
she
felt
him
start
upon
the
open
track
illustration
ere
long
they
knew
that
hidden
there
beneath
a
stolid
mien
dwelt
a
fierce
will
they
could
not
still
they
rode
as
if
by
steam
illustration
peggy
held
on
with
tightening
grip
while
sarah
jane
behind
having
no
hold
to
make
her
bold
to
screaming
gave
her
mind
o
peggy
put
me
down
i
pray
i
ride
in
mortal
dread
do
make
him
stop
or
i
shall
drop
and
break
my
wooden
head
as
those
piteous
words
she
spoke
they
struck
a
fearful
snag
their
grips
they
lost
and
both
were
tossed
upon
the
cruel
flag
illustration
their
senses
for
a
moment
gone
they
lay
in
ghastly
plight
their
fiery
steed
from
burden
freed
maintained
his
onward
flight
then
each
in
aching
consciousness
rose
slowly
with
sad
groans
next
faced
about
with
angry
shout
followed
by
tears
and
moans
illustration
each
blamed
the
other
for
the
fall
until
in
gentler
mood
their
hurts
they
dress
while
both
confess
the
crying
did
them
good
a
wooden
crutch
poor
peggy
finds
to
help
her
on
her
feet
both
their
steps
retraced
to
where
they
first
did
meet
illustration
but
sorrow
tears
are
quickly
dried
with
dolls
as
well
as
a
jolly
crowd
all
laughing
loud
i
think
you
count
just
ten
mounted
a
little
wooden
cart
while
peggy
brave
and
tried
got
up
in
front
to
bear
the
brunt
of
hobby
mighty
stride
illustration
finding
a
pleasant
open
space
gay
peg
unships
her
load
suggests
a
game
which
it
is
plain
will
soon
be
quite
the
mode
she
tells
of
former
christmas
nights
when
many
of
her
kind
at
played
and
merry
made
fast
running
like
the
wind
the
happy
moments
swiftly
sped
in
unabated
glee
their
lungs
were
strong
their
legs
were
long
and
supple
at
the
knee
illustration
but
soon
they
hear
the
clock
strike
two
the
hours
are
flying
fast
with
much
to
do
ere
night
be
its
pleasures
overpast
just
one
leap
more
cries
sarah
jane
this
fills
my
wildest
dream
as
she
spoke

deutchland
broke
into
a
piercing
scream
then
all
look
round
as
well
they
may
to
see
a
horrid
sight
the
blackest
gnome
stands
there
alone
they
scatter
in
their
fright
with
kindly
smile
he
nearer
draws
begs
them
to
feel
no
fear
what
is
your
name
cries
sarah
jane
the
my
dear
their
fears
allayed
each
takes
an
arm
while
up
and
down
they
walk
with
sidelong
glance
each
tries
her
chance
and
charms
him
with
small
talk
illustration
another
wonder
now
attracts
the
simple
sarah

upon
one
knee
she
drops
with
glee
in

pretty
thing
to

long
with
fiendish
glee

gets
out
of
sight
fresh
tricks
to
plan
you
see
illustration
soon
sarah

new
courage
takes
she
hits
upon
a
plan
makes
up
her
mind
to
run
behind
and
kill
the
staring
man
attempts
are
vain
he
will
not
die
in
terror
sarah

meets
a
new
toy
called

boy
and
begs
him
just
to
please
illustration
to
help
her
pay
bad
peggy
back
for
her
malicious
tricks
nor
does
she
see
that
even
he
enjoys
her
woeful
fix
peg
pious
face
and
peaceful
pose
you
think
portended
fair
when
like
a
flash
she
makes
a
dash
sends
sarah
high
in
air
illustration
entangled
in
the
scissors
boy
alas
death
seems
quite
near
her
trust
betrayed
this
hapless
maid
sobs
out
her
grief
and
fear
was
peggy
fault
the
whole
way
through
the
boy
had
meant
no
harm
both
ran
away
nor
thought
to
stay
poor
sarah
fright
to
calm
illustration
a
handsome
soldier
passing
by
his
heart
quite
free
from
guile
with
martial
air
and
manner
rare
soon
helped
the
girl
to
smile
he
said
the
ball
would
now
begin
and
begged
her
for
a
dance
she
bowed
so
low
it
looked
as
her
style
had
come
from
france
illustration
a
lively
waltz
the
couple
take
while
all
admire
their
grace
as
round
and
round
upon
the
ground
they
spin
with
quickened
pace
and
shameless
peg
sits
on
a
chair
a
true
flower
of
the
wall
while
sarah
jane
tis
very
plain
need
never
rest
at
all
illustration
with
graceful
compliment
the
clown
bows
low
before
the
belle
whose
modest
face
and
simple
grace
in
starry
robe
looked
well
i
know
i
but
a
stupid
clown
and
play
a
clumsy
role
yet
underneath
this
painted
sheath
i
wear
an
ardent
soul
illustration
just
then
a
jovial
african
with
large
admiring
eyes
seizes
her
hand
just
as
the
band
to
give
them
a
surprise
strikes
up
the
like
a
flash
both
spring
into
their
place
away
they
go
first
quick
then
slow
each
movement
fraught
with
grace
illustration
the
jolly
pair
then
pause
to
watch
a
magnate
from
japan
who
quite
alone
so
far
from
home
poor
harmless
little
man
dances
a
curious
eastern
dance
to
many
a
jingling
bell
his
brilliant
dress
they
both
confess
becomes
him
very
well
illustration
and
now
the
ball
is
at
its
height
a
madly
whirling
throng
each
merry
pair
a
smile
doth
wear
and
sambo
sings
a
song
while
in
their
midst
the
artist
head
of
golliwogg
appears
with
peg
beside
whose
graceful
stride
no
criticism
fears
illustration
but
even
wooden
limbs
get
tired
and
want
a
change
of
play
so
golliwogg
a
jolly
dog
suggests
they
run
away
the
big
shop
door
is
bolted
fast
but
through
the
yard
behind
peggy
has
spied
one
open
wide
which
she
will
shortly
find
illustration
illustration
a
touch
a
push
and
out
they
fly
into
the
starlight
night
no
one
must
know
the
way
they
go
they
cover
up
their
flight
and
though
their
laughing
faces
tell
how
they
enjoy
the
fun
no
sound
they
make
but
quickly
take
unto
their
heels
and
run
illustration
nor
stop
until
they
reach
a
field
and
find
a
lovely
slide
no
fear
has
peg
but
meg
and
weg
cling
screaming
as
they
glide
the
golliwogg
with
flying
hair
takes
the
first
lead
you
see
nor
minds
at
all
the
midget
small
her
arms
outstretched
in
glee
illustration
the
sliders
never
dreamed
of
harm
they
sailed
like
ships
at
sea
was
meg
and
weg
who
tripped
up
peg
and
brought
to
grief
their
spree
the
wrong
man
often
gets
the
blame
was
just
so
in
this
case
and
balls
of
snow
they
madly
throw
at
golliwogg
kind
face
illustration
he
catches
one
in
either
eye
and
then
turns
tail
to
run
the
steady
aim
of
sarah
jane
grows
very
serious
fun
he
does
not
like
the
way
girls
act
for
five
to
one
not
fair
there
no
escape
one
hits
his
nape
another
strikes
his
hair
illustration
vengeance
he
cries
i
pay
them
out
if
girls
will
play
with
boys
there
got
be
equality
so
here
for
equipoise
and
then
some
monster
balls
he
makes
he
does
not
spare
the
snow
and
as
each
back
receives
a
whack
like
ninepins
down
they
go
in
life
we
have
our
ups
and
downs
these
dolls
enjoyed
the
same
though
down
went
weg
do
think
i
beg
was
due
to
sarah
jane
you
see
the
sled
was
pretty
full
the
hill
was
rather
steep
weg
was
to
steer
but
in
her
fear
she
took
a
backward
leap
illustration
anon
all
reached
the
valley
safe
and
skating
longed
to
try
the
ice
seemed
good
as
each
one
stood
upon
the
bank
hard
by
while
golliwogg
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
middle
skates
they
hear
a
crack
they
cry
come
back
to
your
devoted
mates
illustration
too
late
alas
their
call
is
vain
he
swiftly
disappears
his
kind
forethought
is
dearly
bought
it
melts
them
unto
tears
but
sturdy
peg
is
quick
to
act
she
gives
an
order
clear
creep
on
your
knees
and
by
degrees
we
to
the
hole
will
steer
illustration
they
reach
in
time
peg
drags
him
out
with
all
her
might
and
main
poor
golliwogg
a
dripping
log
must
be
got
home
again
behold
sure
signs
of
early
dawn
as
down
the
field
they
start
a
leaden
weight
this
living
freight
with
faintly
beating
heart
illustration
in
half
an
hour
the
sun
comes
up
and
shows
a
merry
face
he
winks
an
eye
as
passing
by
he
sees
the
skating
place
and
when
he
peeps
into
the
shop
with
jolly
laughing
eye
tho
he
not
blind
he
can
not
find
a
single
toy
awry
