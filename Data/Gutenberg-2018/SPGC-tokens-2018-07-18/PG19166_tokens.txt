another
story
begins
the
quirt
chapter
one
little
fish
quirt
creek
flowed
sluggishly
between
willows
which
sagged
none
too
gracefully
across
its
deeper
pools
or
languished
beside
the
rocky
stretches
that
were
bone
dry
from
july
to
october
with
a
narrow
channel
in
the
center
where
what
water
there
was
hurried
along
to
the
pools
below
for
a
mile
or
more
where
the
land
lay
fairly
level
in
a
valley
set
in
the
lower
hills
the
mud
that
rimmed
the
pools
was
scored
deep
with
the
tracks
of
the
tj
cattle
as
the
double
monogram
of
hunter
and
johnson
was
called
a
hard
brand
to
work
a
cattleman
would
tell
you
yet
the
tj
herd
never
seemed
to
increase
beyond
a
niggardly
three
hundred
or
so
though
the
quirt
ranch
was
older
than
its
lordly
neighbors
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
who
numbered
their
cattle
by
tens
of
thousands
and
whose
riders
must
have
strings
of
fifteen
horses
apiece
to
keep
them
going
older
too
than
many
a
modest
ranch
that
had
flourished
awhile
and
had
finished
as
of
the
sawtooth
when
the
sawtooth
bought
ranch
and
brand
for
a
lump
sum
that
looked
big
to
the
rancher
who
immediately
departed
to
make
himself
a
new
home
elsewhere
older
than
others
which
had
somehow
gone
to
pieces
when
the
rancher
died
or
went
to
the
penitentiary
under
the
stigma
of
a
long
sentence
as
a
cattle
thief
there
were
many
such
for
the
sawtooth
powerful
and
stern
against
outlawry
tolerated
no
pilfering
from
their
thousands
the
less
you
have
the
more
careful
you
are
of
your
possessions
hunter
and
johnson
owned
exactly
a
section
and
a
half
of
land
and
for
a
mile
and
a
half
quirt
creek
was
fenced
upon
either
side
they
hired
two
men
cut
what
hay
they
could
from
a
field
which
they
irrigated
fed
their
cattle
through
the
cold
weather
watched
them
zealously
through
the
summer
and
managed
to
ship
enough
beef
each
fall
to
pay
their
grocery
bill
and
their
men
wages
and
have
a
balance
sufficient
to
buy
what
clothes
they
needed
and
perhaps
pay
a
doctor
if
one
of
them
fell
ill
which
frequently
happened
since
brit
was
becoming
a
prey
to
rheumatism
that
sometimes
kept
him
in
bed
and
frank
occasionally
indulged
himself
in
a
gallon
or
so
of
bad
whisky
and
suffered
afterwards
from
a
badly
deranged
digestion
their
house
was
a
log
cabin
built
when
logs
were
easier
to
get
than
lumber
that
the
cabin
contained
two
rooms
was
the
result
of
circumstances
rather
than
design
brit
had
hauled
from
the
logs
long
and
logs
short
and
it
had
seemed
a
shame
to
cut
the
long
ones
any
shorter
later
when
the
outside
world
had
crept
a
little
closer
to
their
wilderness
as
go
where
you
will
the
outside
world
has
a
way
of
doing
he
had
built
a
shed
against
the
cabin
from
what
lumber
there
was
left
after
building
a
cowshed
against
the
log
barn
in
the
early
days
brit
had
had
a
wife
and
two
children
but
the
wife
could
not
endure
the
loneliness
of
the
ranch
nor
the
inconvenience
of
living
in
a
log
cabin
she
was
continually
worrying
over
rattlesnakes
and
diphtheria
and
pneumonia
and
begging
brit
to
sell
out
and
live
in
town
she
had
married
him
because
he
was
a
cowboy
and
because
he
was
a
nimble
dancer
and
rode
gallantly
with
spurs
ajingle
on
his
heels
and
a
snakeskin
band
around
his
hat
and
because
a
ranch
away
out
on
quirt
creek
had
sounded
exactly
like
a
story
in
a
book
adventure
picturesqueness
even
romance
are
recognized
and
appreciated
only
at
a
distance
hunter
lost
the
perspective
of
romance
and
adventure
and
shed
tears
because
there
was
sufficient
mineral
in
the
water
to
yellow
her
week
washing
and
for
various
other
causes
which
she
had
never
foreseen
and
to
which
she
refused
to
resign
herself
came
a
time
when
she
delivered
a
ultimatum
to
brit
either
he
must
sell
out
and
move
to
town
or
she
would
take
the
children
and
leave
him
of
towns
brit
knew
nothing
except
the
saloon
cheap
restaurant
side
and
a
barber
shop
where
a
fellow
could
get
a
shave
and
before
he
went
to
see
his
girl
brit
could
not
imagine
himself
actually
day
after
day
in
a
town
three
or
four
days
had
always
been
his
limit
it
was
in
a
restaurant
that
he
had
first
met
his
wife
he
had
stayed
three
days
when
he
had
meant
to
finish
his
business
in
one
because
there
was
an
awfully
nice
girl
waiting
on
table
in
the
palace
and
because
there
was
going
to
be
a
dance
on
saturday
night
and
he
wanted
his
acquaintance
with
her
to
develop
to
the
point
where
he
might
ask
her
to
go
with
him
and
be
reasonably
certain
of
a
favorable
answer
brit
would
not
sell
his
ranch
in
this
frank
johnson
friend
and
neighbor
who
had
taken
all
the
land
the
government
would
allow
one
man
to
hold
and
whose
lines
joined
brit
profanely
upheld
him
they
had
planned
to
run
cattle
together
had
their
brand
already
recorded
and
had
scraped
together
enough
money
to
buy
a
dozen
young
cows
luckily
brit
had
proven
up
on
his
homestead
so
that
when
the
irate
hunter
deserted
him
she
did
not
jeopardize
his
right
to
the
land
brit
was
philosophical
thinking
that
a
year
or
so
of
town
life
would
be
a
cure
if
he
missed
the
children
he
was
free
from
tears
and
nagging
complaints
so
that
his
content
balanced
his
loneliness
frank
proved
up
and
came
down
to
live
with
him
and
the
partnership
began
to
wear
into
permanency
share
and
share
alike
they
lived
and
worked
and
wrangled
together
like
brothers
for
months
brit
wife
was
too
angry
and
spiteful
to
write
then
she
wrote
acrimoniously
reminding
brit
of
his
duty
to
his
children
royal
was
old
enough
for
school
and
needed
clothes
she
was
slaving
for
them
as
she
had
never
thought
to
slave
when
brit
promised
to
honor
and
protect
her
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
was
their
father
even
if
he
did
not
act
like
one
she
needed
at
least
ten
dollars
brit
showed
the
letter
to
frank
and
the
two
talked
it
over
solemnly
while
they
sat
on
inverted
feed
buckets
beside
the
stable
facing
the
unearthly
beauty
of
a
idaho
sunset
they
did
not
feel
that
they
could
afford
to
sell
a
cow
and
steers
were
out
of
the
question
they
decided
to
sell
an
unbroken
colt
that
a
fancied
in
a
week
brit
wrote
a
brief
letter
to
minnie
and
enclosed
a
banknote
with
the
two
dollars
and
a
half
which
remained
of
his
share
of
the
sale
brit
sent
to
a
house
for
a
mackinaw
coat
and
felt
cheated
afterwards
because
the
coat
was
not
wind
and
water
proof
as
advertised
in
the
catalogue
more
months
passed
and
brit
received
by
registered
mail
a
notice
that
he
was
being
sued
for
divorce
on
the
ground
of
he
felt
hurt
because
as
he
pointed
out
to
frank
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
support
minnie
and
the
kids
if
they
came
back
where
he
could
have
a
chance
he
wrote
this
painstakingly
to
the
lawyer
and
received
no
reply
later
he
learned
from
minnie
that
she
had
freed
herself
from
him
and
that
she
was
keeping
boarders
and
asking
no
odds
of
him
to
come
at
once
to
the
end
of
brit
matrimonial
affairs
he
heard
from
the
children
once
in
a
year
perhaps
after
they
were
old
enough
to
write
he
did
not
send
them
money
because
he
seemed
never
to
have
any
money
to
send
and
because
they
did
not
ask
for
any
dumbly
he
sensed
as
their
handwriting
and
their
spelling
improved
that
his
children
were
growing
up
but
when
he
thought
of
them
they
seemed
remote
prattling
youngsters
whom
minnie
was
forever
worrying
over
and
who
seemed
to
have
been
always
under
the
heels
of
his
horse
or
under
the
wheels
of
his
wagon
or
playing
with
the
pitchfork
or
wandering
off
into
the
sage
while
he
and
their
distracted
mother
searched
for
them
for
a
long
while
how
many
years
brit
could
not
remember
they
had
been
living
in
los
angeles
prospering
too
brit
understood
the
girl
lorraine
minnie
had
wanted
fancy
names
for
the
kids
and
brit
apologized
whenever
he
spoke
of
them
which
was
seldom
lorraine
had
written
that
mamma
has
an
apartment
house
that
had
sounded
prosperous
even
at
the
beginning
and
as
the
years
passed
and
their
address
remained
the
same
brit
became
fixed
in
the
belief
that
the
casa
grande
was
all
that
its
name
implied
and
perhaps
more
minnie
must
be
getting
rich
she
had
a
picture
of
the
place
on
the
stationery
which
lorraine
used
when
she
wrote
him
there
were
two
palm
trees
in
front
with
bay
windows
behind
them
and
pillars
brit
used
to
study
these
magnificences
and
thank
god
that
minnie
was
doing
so
well
he
never
could
have
given
her
a
home
like
that
brit
sometimes
added
that
he
had
never
been
cut
out
for
a
married
man
anyway
forgot
that
brit
had
ever
been
married
and
late
comers
never
heard
of
it
to
all
intents
the
owners
of
the
quirt
outfit
were
old
bachelors
who
kept
pretty
much
to
themselves
went
to
town
only
when
they
needed
supplies
rode
old
saddles
and
grinned
scornfully
at
and
and
listened
to
all
the
range
gossip
without
adding
so
much
as
an
opinion
they
never
talked
politics
nor
told
which
candidates
received
their
two
votes
they
kept
the
same
two
men
season
after
season
leathery
old
range
hands
with
eyes
that
saw
whatever
came
within
their
field
of
vision
and
with
the
gift
of
silence
which
is
rare
if
you
know
anything
at
all
about
cattlemen
you
will
know
that
the
quirt
was
a
poor
man
ranch
when
i
tell
you
that
hunter
and
johnson
milked
three
cows
and
made
butter
fed
a
few
pigs
on
the
skim
milk
and
the
alfalfa
stalks
which
the
saddle
horses
and
the
cows
disdained
to
eat
kept
a
flock
of
chickens
and
sold
what
butter
eggs
and
pork
they
did
not
need
for
themselves
cattlemen
seldom
do
that
more
often
they
buy
milk
in
small
tin
cans
butter
in
squares
and
do
without
eggs
four
of
a
kind
were
the
men
of
the
tj
and
even
bill
warfield
president
and
general
manager
of
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
and
of
the
federal
reclamation
company
and
several
other
companies
state
senator
and
general
benefactor
of
the
sawtooth
country
even
the
great
bill
warfield
lifted
his
hat
to
the
owners
of
the
quirt
when
he
met
them
and
spoke
of
them
as
the
finest
specimens
of
our
old
type
of
range
men
senator
warfield
himself
represented
the
modern
type
of
range
man
and
was
proud
of
his
progressiveness
never
a
scheme
for
the
country
development
was
hatched
but
you
would
find
senator
warfield
closely
allied
with
it
his
voice
the
deciding
one
when
policies
and
progress
were
being
discussed
as
to
the
sawtooth
forty
thousand
acres
comprised
their
holdings
under
patents
deeds
and
leases
from
the
government
another
twenty
thousand
acres
they
had
access
to
through
the
grace
of
the
owners
and
there
was
grazing
besides
which
the
sawtooth
could
have
if
it
chose
to
pay
the
nominal
rental
sum
the
quirt
ranch
was
almost
surrounded
by
sawtooth
land
of
one
sort
or
another
though
there
was
scant
grazing
in
the
early
spring
on
the
sagebrush
wilderness
to
the
south
this
needed
quirt
creek
for
accessible
water
and
quirt
creek
save
where
it
ran
through
hills
was
fenced
within
the
section
and
a
half
of
the
tj
so
there
they
were
small
fish
making
shift
to
live
precariously
with
other
small
fish
in
a
pool
where
big
fish
swam
lazily
if
one
small
fish
now
and
then
disappeared
with
mysterious
abruptness
the
other
small
fish
would
perhaps
scurry
here
and
there
for
a
time
but
few
would
leave
the
pool
for
the
safe
shallows
beyond
this
is
a
tale
of
the
little
fishes
chapter
two
the
enchantment
of
long
distance
lorraine
hunter
always
maintained
that
she
was
a
western
girl
if
she
reached
the
point
of
furnishing
details
she
would
tell
you
that
she
had
ridden
horses
from
the
time
that
she
could
walk
and
that
her
father
was
a
of
idaho
whose
cattle
fed
upon
a
thousand
hills
when
she
was
twelve
she
told
her
playmates
exciting
tales
about
rattlesnakes
when
she
was
fifteen
she
sat
breathless
in
the
movies
and
watched
picturesque
horsemen
careering
up
and
down
and
around
the
thousand
hills
and
believed
in
her
heart
that
half
the
western
pictures
were
taken
on
or
near
her
father
ranch
she
seemed
to
remember
certain
landmarks
and
would
point
them
out
to
her
companions
and
whisper
a
desultory
lecture
on
the
cattle
industry
as
illustrated
by
the
picture
she
was
much
inclined
to
criticism
of
the
costuming
and
the
acting
at
eighteen
she
knew
definitely
that
she
hated
the
very
name
casa
grande
she
hated
the
narrow
hallway
with
its
tree
where
no
one
ever
hung
a
hat
and
the
seat
beneath
where
no
one
ever
sat
down
she
hated
the
row
of
boxes
on
the
wall
with
the
bell
buttons
above
each
apartment
number
she
hated
the
jangling
of
the
hall
telephone
the
scurrying
to
answer
the
prodding
of
whichever
bell
button
would
summon
the
tenant
asked
for
by
the
caller
she
hated
the
meek
little
filipino
boy
who
swept
that
ugly
hall
every
morning
she
hated
the
scrubby
palms
in
front
she
hated
the
pillars
where
the
paint
was
peeling
badly
she
hated
the
conflicting
odors
that
seeped
into
the
atmosphere
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
she
hated
the
three
old
maids
on
the
third
floor
and
the
frowsy
woman
on
the
first
who
sat
on
the
front
steps
in
her
soiled
breakfast
cap
and
bungalow
apron
she
hated
the
nervous
tenant
who
occupied
the
apartment
just
over
her
and
pounded
with
a
broom
handle
on
the
floor
when
lorraine
practised
overtime
on
chromatic
scales
at
eighteen
lorraine
managed
somehow
to
obtain
work
in
a
western
picture
and
being
unusually
pretty
she
so
far
distinguished
herself
that
she
was
given
a
small
part
in
the
next
production
her
glorious
duty
it
was
to
ride
madly
through
the
little
set
to
the
where
the
sheriff
posse
lounged
conspicuously
and
there
pull
her
horse
to
an
abrupt
stand
and
point
excitedly
to
the
distant
hills
also
she
danced
quite
close
to
the
camera
in
the
typical
cowboy
dance
which
was
a
feature
of
this
particular
production
lorraine
thereby
earned
enough
money
to
buy
her
fall
suit
and
coat
and
cheap
furs
and
learned
to
ride
a
horse
at
a
gallop
and
to
dance
what
passed
in
pictures
as
a
square
dance
at
nineteen
years
of
age
lorraine
hunter
daughter
of
old
brit
hunter
of
the
tj
became
a
real
girl
with
a
real
stetson
hat
of
her
own
a
green
corduroy
riding
skirt
gray
flannel
shirt
brilliant
neckerchief
boots
and
spurs
a
third
picture
gave
her
further
practice
in
riding
a
real
horse
albeit
an
extremely
docile
animal
called
mouse
with
good
reason
she
became
known
on
the
lot
as
a
real
daughter
though
she
did
not
know
the
name
of
her
brand
and
in
all
her
life
had
seen
no
herd
larger
than
the
thirty
head
of
tame
cattle
which
were
chased
past
the
camera
again
and
again
to
make
them
look
like
ten
thousand
and
which
were
so
thoroughly
camera
broke
that
they
stopped
when
they
were
out
of
the
scene
turned
and
were
ready
to
repeat
the
performance
had
she
lived
her
life
on
the
quirt
ranch
she
would
have
known
a
great
deal
more
about
horseback
riding
and
cattle
and
range
dances
she
would
have
known
a
great
deal
less
about
the
romance
of
the
west
however
and
she
would
probably
never
have
seen
a
sheriff
posse
riding
twenty
strong
and
bunched
like
when
it
leaves
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
indeed
i
am
very
sure
she
would
not
killings
such
as
her
father
heard
of
with
his
lips
drawn
tight
and
the
cords
standing
out
on
the
sides
of
his
skinny
neck
she
would
have
considered
the
grim
tragedies
they
were
without
once
thinking
of
the
picture
value
of
the
crime
as
it
was
her
west
was
filled
with
men
who
died
suddenly
in
gobs
of
red
paint
and
girls
who
rode
and
panting
with
hand
held
over
the
heart
hurrying
for
doctors
and
cowboys
and
parsons
and
such
she
had
seen
many
a
man
whip
pistol
from
holster
and
dare
a
mob
with
lips
drawn
back
in
a
wolfish
grin
over
his
white
even
teeth
and
kidnappings
were
the
inevitable
accompaniment
of
youth
and
beauty
lorraine
learned
rapidly
in
three
years
she
thrilled
to
more
adventure
than
all
the
bad
men
in
all
the
west
could
have
furnished
had
they
lived
to
be
old
and
worked
hard
at
being
bad
all
their
lives
for
in
that
third
year
she
worked
her
way
enthusiastically
through
a
movie
serial
called
the
terror
of
the
range
she
was
past
mistress
of
romance
by
that
time
she
knew
her
west
it
was
just
after
the
terror
of
the
range
was
finished
that
a
great
revulsion
in
the
management
of
this
particular
company
stopped
production
with
a
stunning
completeness
that
left
actors
and
actresses
feeling
very
much
as
if
the
studio
roof
had
fallen
upon
them
west
vanished
the
little
set
was
being
torn
down
to
make
room
for
something
else
quite
different
the
cowboys
appeared
in
tailored
suits
and
drifted
away
lorraine
went
home
to
the
casa
grande
hating
it
more
than
ever
she
had
hated
it
in
her
life
some
one
was
frying
liver
and
onions
which
was
in
flagrant
defiance
of
rule
four
which
mentioned
cabbage
onions
and
fried
fish
as
undesirable
foodstuffs
outside
the
palm
leaves
were
dripping
in
the
night
fog
that
had
swept
soggily
in
from
the
ocean
her
mother
was
trying
to
collect
a
gas
bill
from
the
dressmaker
down
the
hall
who
protested
shrilly
that
she
distinctly
remembered
having
paid
that
gas
bill
once
and
had
no
intention
of
paying
it
twice
lorraine
opened
the
door
marked
landlady
and
closed
it
with
a
slam
intended
to
remind
her
mother
that
bickerings
in
the
hall
were
less
desirable
than
the
odor
of
fried
onions
she
had
often
spoken
to
her
mother
about
the
vulgarity
of
arguing
in
public
with
the
tenants
but
her
mother
never
seemed
to
see
things
as
lorraine
saw
them
in
the
apartment
sat
a
man
who
had
been
too
frequent
a
visitor
as
lorraine
judged
him
he
was
an
oldish
man
with
the
lines
of
failure
in
his
face
and
on
his
lean
form
the
sprightly
clothing
of
youth
he
had
been
a
reporter
was
still
he
maintained
but
lorraine
suspected
shrewdly
that
he
scarcely
made
a
living
for
himself
and
that
he
was
in
more
ways
than
one
when
he
came
to
visit
her
mother
the
affair
had
progressed
appreciably
in
her
absence
it
would
appear
he
greeted
her
with
a
fatherly
hello
kiddie
and
would
have
kissed
her
had
lorraine
not
evaded
him
skilfully
her
mother
came
in
then
and
complained
intimately
to
the
man
and
declared
that
the
dressmaker
would
have
to
pay
that
bill
or
have
her
gas
turned
off
he
offered
sympathy
assistance
in
the
turning
off
of
the
gas
and
a
kiss
which
was
perfectly
audible
to
lorraine
in
the
next
room
the
affair
had
indeed
progressed
know
you
got
a
new
papa
her
mother
called
out
in
the
peculiar
chirpy
tone
she
used
when
she
was
exuberantly
happy
i
knew
you
be
surprised
i
am
lorraine
agreed
pulling
aside
the
cheap
green
portières
and
looked
in
upon
the
two
her
tone
was
unenthusiastic
a
superfluous
gift
of
doubtful
value
i
do
not
feel
the
need
of
a
papa
thank
you
if
you
want
him
for
a
husband
mother
that
is
entirely
your
own
affair
i
hope
you
be
very
happy
the
kid
do
want
a
papa
husbands
are
what
means
the
most
in
her
young
life
chuckled
the
groom
restraining
his
bride
when
she
would
have
risen
from
his
knee
i
hope
you
both
be
very
happy
indeed
said
lorraine
gravely
now
you
wo
mind
mother
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
dad
ranch
in
idaho
i
really
meant
it
for
a
vacation
but
since
you
wo
be
alone
i
may
stay
with
dad
permanently
i
leaving
or
the
next
day
just
as
soon
as
i
can
pack
my
trunk
and
get
a
pullman
berth
she
did
not
wait
to
see
the
relief
in
her
mother
face
contradicting
the
expostulations
on
her
lips
she
went
out
to
the
telephone
in
the
hall
remembered
suddenly
that
her
business
would
be
overheard
by
half
the
tenants
and
decided
to
use
the
public
telephone
in
a
hotel
farther
down
the
street
her
decision
to
go
to
her
dad
had
been
born
with
the
words
on
her
lips
but
it
was
a
lusty
young
decision
and
it
was
growing
at
an
amazing
rate
of
course
she
would
go
to
her
dad
in
idaho
she
was
astonished
that
the
idea
had
never
before
crystallized
into
action
why
should
she
feed
her
imagination
upon
a
mimic
west
when
the
great
glorious
real
west
was
there
what
if
her
dad
had
not
written
a
word
for
more
than
a
year
he
must
be
alive
they
would
surely
have
heard
of
his
death
for
she
and
royal
were
his
sole
heirs
and
his
partner
would
have
their
address
she
walked
fast
and
arrived
at
the
telephone
booth
so
breathless
that
she
was
compelled
to
wait
a
few
minutes
before
she
could
call
her
number
she
inquired
about
trains
and
rates
to
echo
idaho
echo
idaho
while
she
waited
for
the
information
clerk
to
look
it
up
the
very
words
conjured
visions
of
wide
horizons
and
clean
winds
and
high
adventure
if
she
pictured
echo
idaho
as
being
a
replica
of
the
set
used
in
the
movie
serial
can
you
wonder
if
she
saw
herself
the
beloved
queen
of
her
father
cowboys
dashing
into
echo
idaho
on
a
broncho
that
pirouetted
gaily
before
the
while
handsome
young
men
in
chaps
and
spurs
and
big
four
stetsons
watched
her
yearningly
she
was
merely
living
mentally
the
only
west
that
she
knew
from
that
beatific
vision
lorraine
floated
into
others
more
entrancing
all
the
hairbreadth
escapes
of
the
heroine
of
the
movie
serial
were
hers
adapted
by
her
native
logic
to
fit
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
though
i
must
admit
they
bulged
here
and
there
and
threatened
to
overlap
and
to
encroach
upon
the
impossible
over
the
hills
where
her
father
vast
herds
grazed
sleek
and
wild
and
and
prone
to
stampede
galloped
the
lorraine
of
dreams
on
horses
and
swift
with
her
galloped
strong
men
whose
faces
limned
the
features
of
her
favorite
western
lead
that
for
all
her
three
years
of
intermittent
intimacy
with
a
disillusioning
world
of
mimicry
her
dreams
were
pure
romance
proved
that
lorraine
had
still
the
unclouded
innocence
of
her
girlhood
unspoiled
chapter
three
reality
is
weighed
and
found
wanting
still
dreaming
her
dreams
still
featuring
herself
as
the
star
of
many
adventures
lorraine
followed
the
brakeman
out
of
the
dusty
day
coach
and
down
the
car
steps
to
the
platform
of
the
place
called
echo
idaho
i
can
only
guess
at
what
she
expected
to
find
there
in
the
person
of
a
father
but
whatever
it
was
she
did
not
find
it
no
father
of
any
type
whatever
came
forward
to
claim
her
in
spite
of
her
western
experience
she
looked
about
her
for
a
taxi
or
at
least
a
street
car
even
in
the
wilds
of
western
melodrama
one
could
hear
the
clang
of
gongs
warning
careless
autoists
off
the
track
after
the
train
had
hooted
and
gone
on
around
an
absolutely
uninteresting
low
hill
of
yellow
barrenness
dotted
with
stunted
sage
it
was
the
silence
that
first
impressed
lorraine
disagreeably
echo
idaho
was
a
very
poor
imitation
of
all
the
western
sets
she
had
ever
seen
true
it
had
the
straggling
row
of
buildings
with
hitch
rails
but
the
signs
painted
across
the
fronts
were
absolutely
common
any
director
she
had
ever
obeyed
would
have
sent
for
his
assistant
director
and
would
have
used
language
which
a
lady
must
not
listen
to
behind
the
store
and
the
and
the
blacksmith
shop
on
the
brow
of
the
low
hill
around
whose
point
the
train
had
disappeared
were
houses
with
bay
windows
and
porches
absolutely
out
of
keeping
with
the
west
so
far
as
lorraine
could
see
there
was
not
a
log
cabin
in
the
whole
place
the
hitch
rails
were
empty
and
there
was
not
a
cowboy
in
sight
before
the
a
terribly
grimy
touring
car
stood
with
its
loaded
with
suitcases
three
goggled
sunburned
women
in
ugly
khaki
suits
were
disconsolately
drinking
soda
water
from
bottles
without
straws
and
a
goggled
man
was
jerking
impatiently
at
the
hood
of
the
machine
lorraine
and
her
suitcase
apparently
excited
no
interest
whatever
in
echo
idaho
the
station
agent
was
carrying
two
boxes
of
oranges
and
a
crate
of
california
cabbages
in
out
of
the
sun
and
a
limp
individual
in
blue
gingham
shirt
and
dirty
overalls
had
shouldered
the
mail
sack
and
was
making
his
way
across
the
dusty
street
to
the
two
questions
and
two
brief
answers
convinced
her
that
the
station
agent
did
not
know
britton
hunter
which
was
strange
unless
this
happened
to
be
a
very
new
agent
lorraine
left
him
to
his
cabbages
and
followed
the
man
with
the
mail
sack
at
the
the
anemic
clerk
came
forward
eyeing
her
with
admiring
curiosity
lorraine
had
seen
anemic
young
men
all
her
life
and
the
last
three
years
had
made
her
perfectly
familiar
with
that
look
in
a
young
man
eyes
she
met
it
with
impatient
disfavor
founded
chiefly
upon
the
young
man
need
of
a
decent
a
less
flowery
tie
and
a
tailored
suit
when
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
know
britton
hunter
by
sight
he
ceased
to
exist
so
far
as
lorraine
was
concerned
she
decided
that
he
also
was
new
to
the
place
and
therefore
perfectly
useless
to
her
the
postmaster
himself
lorraine
was
cheered
by
his
spectacles
his
shirt
sleeves
and
his
chin
whiskers
which
made
him
look
the
part
was
better
informed
he
too
eyed
her
curiously
when
she
said
my
father
britton
hunter
but
he
made
no
comment
on
the
relationship
he
gave
her
a
telegram
and
a
letter
from
the
general
delivery
the
telegram
she
suspected
was
the
one
she
had
sent
to
her
dad
announcing
the
date
of
her
arrival
the
postmaster
advised
her
to
get
a
livery
rig
and
drive
out
to
the
ranch
since
it
might
be
a
week
or
two
before
any
one
came
in
from
the
quirt
lorraine
thanked
him
graciously
and
departed
for
the
livery
stable
the
man
in
charge
there
chewed
tobacco
meditatively
and
told
her
that
his
teams
were
all
out
if
she
was
a
mind
to
wait
over
a
day
or
two
he
said
he
might
maybe
be
able
to
make
the
trip
lorraine
took
a
long
look
at
the
structure
which
he
indicated
as
the
hotel
i
think
i
walk
she
said
calmly
the
stableman
stopped
chewing
and
stared
at
her
it
some
of
a
walk
it
all
of
eighteen
mile
i
dunno
but
twenty
time
to
the
house
i
have
frequently
walked
or
thirty
miles
i
am
a
member
of
the
sierra
club
in
los
angeles
we
seldom
take
hikes
of
less
than
twenty
miles
if
you
will
kindly
tell
me
which
road
i
must
take
there
she
is
the
man
stated
flatly
and
pointed
across
the
railroad
track
to
where
a
sandy
road
drew
a
yellowish
line
through
the
sage
evidently
making
for
the
hills
showing
hazily
violet
in
the
distance
those
hills
formed
the
only
break
in
the
monotonous
gray
landscape
and
lorraine
was
glad
that
her
journey
would
take
her
close
to
them
thank
you
so
much
she
said
coldly
and
returned
to
the
station
in
the
small
lavatory
of
the
depot
waiting
room
she
exchanged
her
slippers
for
a
pair
of
moderately
shoes
which
she
had
at
the
last
minute
of
packing
tucked
into
her
suitcase
put
a
few
extra
articles
into
her
rather
smart
traveling
bag
left
the
suitcase
in
the
telegraph
office
and
started
not
another
question
would
she
ask
of
echo
idaho
which
was
flatter
and
more
insipid
than
the
drinking
water
in
the
tin
cooler
in
the
waiting
room
the
station
agent
stood
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
watched
her
cross
the
track
and
start
down
the
road
pardonably
astonished
to
see
a
young
woman
walk
down
a
road
that
led
only
to
the
hills
twenty
miles
away
carrying
her
luggage
exactly
as
if
her
trip
was
a
matter
of
a
block
or
two
at
most
the
bag
was
rather
heavy
and
as
she
went
on
it
became
heavier
she
meant
to
carry
it
slung
across
her
shoulder
on
a
stick
as
soon
as
she
was
well
away
from
the
prying
eyes
of
echo
inhabitants
later
if
she
felt
tired
she
could
easily
hide
it
behind
a
bush
along
the
road
and
send
one
of
her
father
cowboys
after
it
the
road
was
very
dusty
and
carried
the
traces
of
automobile
tires
some
one
would
surely
overtake
her
and
give
her
a
ride
before
she
walked
very
far
for
the
first
half
hour
she
believed
that
she
was
walking
on
level
ground
but
when
she
looked
back
there
was
no
sign
of
any
town
behind
her
echo
had
disappeared
as
completely
as
if
it
had
been
swallowed
even
the
unseemly
houses
on
the
hill
had
gone
under
she
walked
for
another
half
hour
and
saw
only
the
gray
sage
stretching
all
around
her
the
hills
looked
farther
away
than
when
she
started
still
that
beaten
road
must
lead
somewhere
two
hours
later
she
began
to
wonder
why
this
particular
road
should
be
so
unending
and
so
empty
never
in
her
life
before
had
she
walked
for
two
hours
without
seeming
to
get
anywhere
or
without
seeing
any
living
human
both
shoulders
were
sore
from
the
weight
of
the
bag
on
the
stick
but
the
sagebushes
looked
so
exactly
alike
that
she
feared
she
could
not
describe
the
particular
spot
where
the
cowboys
would
find
her
bag
wherefore
she
carried
it
still
she
was
beginning
to
change
hands
very
often
when
the
wind
came
just
where
or
how
that
wind
sprang
up
she
did
not
know
suddenly
it
was
whooping
across
the
sage
and
flinging
up
clouds
of
dust
from
the
road
to
lorraine
softened
by
years
of
southern
california
weather
it
seemed
to
blow
straight
off
an
ice
field
it
was
so
cold
after
an
interminable
time
which
measured
three
hours
on
her
watch
she
came
to
an
abrupt
descent
into
a
creek
bed
down
the
middle
of
which
the
creek
itself
was
flowing
swiftly
here
the
road
forked
a
rough
trail
keeping
on
up
the
creek
the
better
traveled
road
crossing
and
climbing
the
farther
bank
lorraine
scarcely
hesitated
before
she
chose
the
main
trail
which
crossed
the
creek
from
the
creek
the
trail
she
followed
kept
climbing
until
lorraine
wondered
if
there
would
ever
be
a
top
the
wind
whipped
her
narrow
skirts
and
impeded
her
tugged
at
her
hat
tingled
her
nose
and
watered
her
eyes
but
she
kept
on
doggedly
disgustedly
the
west
which
she
had
seen
through
the
glamour
of
romance
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
her
estimation
nothing
but
jack
rabbits
and
little
twittery
birds
moved
through
the
sage
though
she
watched
hungrily
for
horsemen
quite
suddenly
the
gray
landscape
glowed
with
a
palpitating
radiance
unreal
beautiful
beyond
expression
she
stopped
turned
to
face
the
west
and
stared
awestruck
at
one
of
those
flaming
sunsets
which
makes
the
desert
land
seem
but
a
gateway
into
the
ineffable
glory
beyond
the
earth
that
the
gorgeous
presaged
a
thunderstorm
she
never
guessed
and
that
a
thunderstorm
may
be
a
deadly
terrifying
peril
she
never
had
quite
believed
her
mother
had
told
of
people
being
struck
by
lightning
but
lorraine
could
not
associate
lightning
with
death
especially
in
the
west
where
men
usually
died
by
shooting
lynching
or
by
pitching
over
a
cliff
the
wind
hushed
as
suddenly
as
it
had
whooped
warned
by
the
twinkling
lights
far
behind
her
lights
which
must
be
the
small
part
at
last
visible
of
echo
idaho
lorraine
went
on
she
had
been
walking
steadily
for
four
hours
and
she
must
surely
have
come
nearly
twenty
miles
if
she
ever
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
she
believed
that
she
would
see
her
father
ranch
just
beyond
the
afterglow
had
deepened
to
dusk
when
she
came
at
last
to
the
highest
point
of
that
long
grade
far
ahead
loomed
a
cluster
of
square
black
objects
which
must
be
the
ranch
buildings
of
the
quirt
and
spirits
lightened
a
little
what
a
surprise
her
father
and
all
his
cowboys
would
have
when
she
walked
in
upon
them
it
was
almost
worth
the
walk
she
told
herself
hearteningly
she
hoped
that
dad
had
a
good
cook
he
would
wear
a
apron
naturally
and
would
be
tall
and
lean
or
else
very
fat
he
would
be
a
comedy
character
but
she
hoped
he
would
not
be
the
grouchy
kind
which
though
very
funny
when
he
rampages
around
on
the
screen
might
be
rather
uncomfortable
to
meet
when
one
is
tired
and
hungry
and
out
of
sorts
but
of
course
the
crankiest
of
comedy
cooks
would
be
decently
civil
to
men
always
were
except
directors
who
are
paid
for
their
incivility
a
hollow
into
which
she
walked
in
complete
darkness
and
in
silence
save
the
gurgling
of
another
stream
hid
from
sight
the
shadowy
semblance
of
houses
and
barns
and
sheds
their
disappearance
slumped
her
spirits
again
for
without
them
she
was
no
more
than
a
solitary
speck
in
the
vast
loneliness
their
actual
nearness
could
not
comfort
her
she
was
seized
with
a
reasonless
panicky
fear
that
by
the
time
she
crossed
the
stream
and
climbed
the
hill
beyond
they
would
no
longer
be
there
where
she
had
seen
them
she
was
lifting
her
skirts
to
wade
the
creek
when
the
click
of
hoofs
striking
against
rocks
sent
her
scurrying
to
cover
in
a
senseless
fear
i
learned
this
act
from
the
jack
rabbits
she
rallied
herself
shakily
when
she
was
safely
hidden
behind
a
sagebush
whose
pungency
made
her
horribly
afraid
that
she
might
sneeze
which
would
be
too
ridiculous
some
of
dad
cowboys
probably
but
still
they
be
bandits
if
they
were
bandits
they
could
scarcely
be
out
banditting
for
the
two
horsemen
were
talking
in
ordinary
conversational
tones
as
they
rode
leisurely
down
to
the
ford
when
they
passed
lorraine
the
horse
nearest
her
shied
against
the
other
and
was
sworn
at
parenthetically
for
a
fool
against
the
skyline
lorraine
saw
the
rider
form
bulk
squatty
and
ungraceful
reminding
her
of
an
actor
whom
she
knew
and
did
not
like
it
was
that
resemblance
perhaps
which
held
her
quiet
instead
of
following
her
first
impulse
to
speak
to
them
and
ask
them
to
carry
her
grip
to
the
house
the
horses
stopped
with
their
forefeet
in
the
water
and
drooped
heads
to
drink
thirstily
the
riders
continued
their
and
as
i
says
time
and
again
they
ai
big
enough
to
fight
the
outfit
and
the
quicker
they
git
out
the
less
lead
they
carry
under
their
hides
when
they
do
go
what
they
want
to
try
an
hang
on
for
beats
me
why
it
like
setting
into
a
poker
game
with
a
piece
they
ai
got
my
sympathy
i
ai
got
any
use
for
a
damn
fool
no
way
yuh
look
at
it
well
there
the
tj
they
been
here
a
long
while
and
they
packin
any
lead
and
they
ai
getting
out
well
say
lem
me
tell
yuh
something
the
tj
git
theirs
and
git
it
right
drink
all
night
would
yuh
he
swore
long
and
fluently
at
his
horse
spurred
him
through
the
shallows
and
the
two
rode
on
up
the
hill
their
voices
still
mingled
in
desultory
argument
with
now
and
then
an
oath
rising
clearly
above
the
jumble
of
words
they
may
have
been
citizens
riding
home
to
families
that
were
waiting
supper
for
them
but
lorraine
crept
out
from
behind
her
sagebush
sneezing
and
thanking
her
imitation
of
the
jack
rabbits
whoever
they
were
she
was
not
sorry
she
had
let
them
ride
on
they
might
be
her
father
men
and
they
might
have
been
very
polite
and
chivalrous
to
her
but
their
voices
and
their
manner
of
speaking
had
been
rough
and
it
is
one
thing
lorraine
reflected
to
mingle
with
villains
even
to
be
waylaid
and
kidnapped
and
tied
to
trees
and
threatened
with
death
but
it
is
quite
different
to
accost
men
in
the
dark
when
you
know
that
they
are
not
being
rough
to
suit
the
director
of
the
scene
she
was
so
absorbed
in
trying
to
construct
a
range
war
or
something
equally
thrilling
from
the
scrap
of
conversation
she
had
heard
that
she
reached
the
hilltop
in
what
seemed
a
very
few
minutes
of
climbing
the
sky
was
becoming
overcast
already
the
stars
to
the
west
were
blotted
out
and
the
absolute
stillness
of
the
atmosphere
frightened
her
more
than
the
big
dark
wilderness
itself
it
seemed
to
her
exactly
as
though
the
earth
was
holding
its
breath
and
waiting
for
something
terrible
to
happen
the
vague
bulk
of
buildings
was
still
some
distance
ahead
and
when
a
rumble
like
the
deepest
notes
of
a
pipe
organ
began
to
fill
all
the
air
lorraine
thrust
her
grip
under
a
bush
and
began
to
run
her
soggy
shoes
squashing
unpleasantly
on
the
rough
places
in
the
road
lorraine
had
seen
many
stage
storms
and
had
thrilled
ecstatically
to
the
mimic
lightning
knowing
just
how
it
was
made
but
when
that
huge
blackness
behind
and
to
the
left
of
her
began
to
open
and
show
a
terrible
brilliance
within
and
to
close
abruptly
leaving
the
world
ink
black
she
was
terrified
she
wanted
to
hide
as
she
had
hidden
from
those
two
men
but
from
that
stupendous
monster
a
real
thunderstorm
sagebrush
formed
no
protection
whatever
she
must
reach
the
substantial
shelter
of
buildings
the
comforting
presence
of
men
and
women
she
ran
and
as
she
ran
she
wept
aloud
like
a
child
and
called
for
her
father
the
deep
rumble
grew
louder
nearer
the
revealed
brilliance
became
swift
of
blinding
light
that
seemed
to
stab
deep
the
earth
lorraine
ran
awkwardly
her
hands
over
her
ears
crying
out
at
each
lightning
flash
her
voice
drowned
in
the
thunder
that
followed
it
close
then
as
she
neared
the
somber
group
of
buildings
the
clouds
above
them
split
with
a
terrific
rending
crash
and
the
whole
place
stood
pitilessly
revealed
to
her
as
if
a
spotlight
had
been
turned
on
lorraine
stood
aghast
the
buildings
were
not
buildings
at
all
they
were
rocks
great
black
forbidding
boulders
standing
there
on
a
narrow
ridge
having
a
diabolic
likeness
to
houses
the
human
mind
is
wonderfully
resilient
but
readjustment
comes
slowly
after
a
shock
dumbly
refusing
to
admit
the
significance
of
what
she
had
seen
lorraine
went
forward
not
until
she
had
reached
and
had
touched
the
first
grotesque
caricature
of
habitation
did
she
wholly
grasp
the
fact
that
she
was
lost
and
that
shelter
might
be
miles
away
she
stood
and
looked
at
the
orderly
group
of
boulders
as
the
lightning
intermittently
revealed
them
she
saw
where
the
road
ran
on
between
two
rocks
she
would
have
to
follow
the
road
for
after
all
it
must
lead
to
her
father
ranch
probably
she
wondered
irrelevantly
why
her
mother
had
never
mentioned
these
queer
rocks
and
she
wondered
vaguely
if
any
of
them
had
caves
or
ledges
where
she
could
be
safe
from
the
lightning
she
was
on
the
point
of
stepping
out
into
the
road
again
when
a
horseman
rode
into
sight
between
the
two
rocks
in
the
same
instant
of
his
appearance
she
heard
the
unmistakable
crack
of
a
gun
saw
the
rider
jerk
backward
in
the
saddle
throw
up
one
hand
and
then
the
darkness
dropped
between
them
lorraine
crouched
behind
a
juniper
bush
close
against
the
rock
and
waited
the
next
flash
came
within
a
it
showed
a
man
at
the
horse
head
holding
it
by
the
bridle
the
horse
was
rearing
lorraine
tried
to
scream
that
the
man
on
the
ground
would
be
trampled
but
something
went
wrong
with
her
voice
so
that
she
could
only
whisper
when
the
light
came
again
the
man
who
had
been
shot
was
not
altogether
on
the
ground
the
other
working
swiftly
had
thrust
the
injured
foot
through
the
stirrup
lorraine
saw
him
stand
back
and
lift
his
quirt
to
slash
the
horse
across
the
rump
even
through
the
crash
of
thunder
lorraine
heard
the
horse
go
past
her
down
the
hill
galloping
furiously
when
she
could
see
again
she
glimpsed
him
running
while
something
bounced
along
on
the
ground
beside
him
she
saw
the
other
man
with
a
dry
branch
in
his
hand
dragging
it
across
the
road
where
it
ran
between
the
two
rocks
then
lorraine
hunter
hardened
to
the
sight
of
crimes
committed
for
picture
values
only
realized
sickeningly
that
she
had
just
looked
upon
a
real
murder
the
killing
of
a
man
she
felt
very
sick
queer
little
red
sparks
squirmed
and
danced
before
her
eyes
she
crumpled
down
quietly
behind
the
juniper
bush
and
did
not
know
when
the
rain
came
though
it
drenched
her
in
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
of
downpour
chapter
four
she
a
good
girl
when
she
ai
crazy
when
the
sun
has
been
up
just
long
enough
to
take
the
chill
from
the
air
without
having
swallowed
all
the
diamonds
that
spangle
bush
and
twig
and
after
a
night
soaking
rain
it
is
good
to
ride
over
the
hills
of
idaho
and
feel
oneself
a
king
and
never
mind
the
crown
and
the
scepter
lone
morgan
riding
early
to
the
sawtooth
to
see
the
foreman
about
getting
a
man
for
a
few
days
to
help
replace
a
bridge
carried
fifty
yards
downstream
by
a
local
cloudburst
would
not
have
changed
places
with
a
millionaire
the
horse
he
rode
was
the
horse
he
loved
the
horse
he
talked
to
like
a
pal
when
they
were
by
themselves
the
ridge
gave
him
a
wide
outlook
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
far
to
the
north
the
sawtooth
range
showed
blue
the
nearer
mountains
pansy
purple
where
the
pine
trees
stood
the
foothills
shaded
delicately
where
canyons
swept
down
to
the
gray
plain
to
the
south
was
the
sagebrush
a
soft
carpet
under
the
sun
the
sky
was
blue
the
clouds
were
handfuls
of
clean
cotton
floating
lazily
of
the
night
storm
remained
no
trace
save
slippery
mud
when
his
horse
struck
a
patch
of
clay
which
was
not
often
and
the
packed
sand
still
wet
and
soggy
from
the
beating
rain
rock
city
showed
black
and
inhospitable
even
in
the
sunlight
the
rock
walls
rose
sheer
the
roofs
slanted
rakishly
the
signs
scratched
on
the
rock
by
facetious
riders
were
pointless
and
inane
lone
picked
his
way
through
the
crooked
defile
that
was
marked
main
street
on
the
corner
of
the
first
huge
boulder
and
came
abruptly
into
the
road
here
he
turned
north
and
shook
his
horse
into
a
trot
a
hundred
yards
or
so
down
the
slope
beyond
rock
city
he
pulled
up
short
with
a
what
the
hell
that
did
not
sound
profane
but
merely
amazed
in
the
sodden
road
were
the
unmistakable
footprints
of
a
woman
lone
did
not
hesitate
in
naming
the
sex
for
the
wet
sand
held
the
imprint
cleanly
daintily
too
shapely
for
a
boy
too
small
for
any
one
but
a
child
or
a
woman
with
little
feet
and
with
the
point
at
the
toes
proclaiming
the
fashion
of
the
towns
lone
guessed
at
once
that
she
was
a
town
girl
a
stranger
probably
and
that
she
had
passed
since
the
rain
which
meant
since
daylight
he
swung
his
horse
and
rode
back
wondering
where
she
could
have
spent
the
night
halfway
through
rock
city
the
footprints
ended
abruptly
and
lone
turned
back
riding
down
the
trail
at
a
lope
she
could
have
gone
far
he
reasoned
and
if
she
had
been
out
all
night
in
the
rain
with
no
better
shelter
than
rock
city
afforded
she
would
need
help
and
lots
of
it
and
pretty
darn
quick
he
added
to
john
doe
which
was
the
ambiguous
name
of
his
horse
half
a
mile
farther
on
he
overtook
her
rather
he
sighted
her
in
the
trail
saw
her
duck
in
amongst
the
rocks
and
scattered
brush
of
a
small
ravine
and
spurred
after
her
it
was
precarious
footing
for
his
horse
when
he
left
the
road
but
john
doe
was
accustomed
to
that
he
jumped
boulders
shied
around
buckthorn
crashed
through
sagebrush
and
so
brought
the
girl
to
bay
against
a
wet
bank
where
she
stood
shivering
the
terror
in
her
face
and
her
wide
eyes
would
have
made
her
famous
in
the
movies
it
made
lone
afraid
she
was
crazy
lone
swung
off
and
went
up
to
her
guardedly
not
knowing
just
what
an
insane
woman
might
do
when
cornered
there
now
i
not
going
to
hurt
yuh
at
all
he
soothed
i
guess
maybe
you
lost
what
made
you
run
away
from
me
when
you
saw
me
coming
lorraine
continued
to
stare
at
him
i
going
to
the
ranch
and
if
you
like
a
ride
i
lend
you
my
horse
he
be
gentle
if
i
lead
him
it
a
right
smart
walk
from
here
lone
smiled
meaning
to
reassure
her
are
you
the
man
i
saw
shoot
that
man
and
then
fasten
him
to
the
stirrup
of
the
saddle
so
the
horse
dragged
him
down
the
road
if
you
are
i
i
no
oh
no
i
not
the
man
lone
said
gently
i
just
now
came
from
home
better
let
me
take
you
in
to
the
ranch
i
was
going
to
the
ranch
did
you
see
him
shoot
that
man
and
make
the
horse
drag
him
the
horse
he
that
horse
with
the
quirt
and
he
went
tearing
down
the
road
dragging
it
it
was
yes
yes
do
worry
about

and
let
me
take
you
to
the
ranch

on
you
wet
as
a
ducked
pup
that
man
was
just
riding
along
i
saw
him
when
it
lightened
and
he
shot
him
oh
ca

something

after
him
right
now

foot

the
stirrup
i
help

soaked
perseveringly
lone
urged
her
to
the
horse
you
soaking
wet
he
exclaimed
again
it
rained
she
muttered
confusedly
i
thought
it
was
the
ranch
but
they
were
rocks
just
rocks
did
you
him
shoot
that
man
why
why
it
should
be
allowed
he
ought
to
be
arrested
right
away
i
have
called
a
policeman
but
is
thunder
and
lightning
just
perfectly
and
that
horse
going
down
the
road
dragging
you
better
get
some
one
to
double
for
me
in
this
scene
she
said
irrelevantly
i
i
do
know
this
horse
and
if
he
starts
running
the
boys
might
not
catch
him
in
time
it
is
safe
is
it
it
safe
said
lone
pityingly
you
wo
be
dragged
you
just
get
on
and
ride
i
lead
him
john
doe
gentle
as
a
dog
just
straight
riding
lorraine
considered
the
matter
gravely
but
i
saw
a
man
dragged
once
he
been
shot
first
it
it
was
awful
i
bet
it
was
how
you
come
to
be
walking
so
far
lorraine
looked
at
him
suspiciously
lone
thought
her
eyes
were
the
most
wonderful
eyes
and
the
most
terrible
that
he
had
ever
seen
they
were
the
irises
a
clear
dark
gray
the
eyeballs
like
a
healthy
baby
that
was
the
wonder
of
them
but
their
glassy
shine
made
them
terrible
her
lids
lifted
in
a
sudden
stare
you
not
the
man
are
you
i
i
think
he
was
taller
than
you
and
his
hat
was
brown
he
a
brute
a
to
shoot
a
man
just
riding
along
it
rained
she
added
plaintively
my
bag
is
back
there
somewhere
under
a
bush
i
think
i
could
find
the
bush
it
was
where
a
rabbit
was
sitting
but
he
probably
gone
by
this
time
a
rabbit
she
told
him
impressively
would
sit
out
in
the
rain
all
night
would
he
he
get
wet
and
a
rabbit
would
feel
horrid
when
he
was
wet
such
thick
fur
he
never
get
dried
out
where
do
they
go
when
it
rains
they
have
holes
in
the
ground
do
they
yes
sure
they
do
i
you
one
down
the
road
here
a
little
piece
come
on
it
ai
far
to
see
a
rabbit
hole
in
the
ground
lorraine
consented
to
mount
and
ride
while
lone
walked
beside
her
agreeing
with
everything
she
said
that
needed
agreement
when
she
had
gone
a
few
rods
however
she
began
to
call
him
charlie
and
to
criticize
the
direction
of
the
picture
they
should
not
she
declared
mix
murders
and
thunderstorms
in
the
same
scene
while
the
storm
effect
was
perfectly
she
thought
it
rather
detracted
from
the
killing
she
did
not
believe
in
lumping
big
stuff
together
like
that
why
not
have
the
killing
done
by
moonlight
and
use
the
storm
when
the
murderer
was
getting
away
or
something
like
that
and
as
for
taking
them
out
on
location
and
making
all
those
storm
scenes
without
telling
them
in
advance
so
that
they
could
have
dry
clothes
afterwards
she
thought
it
a
perfect
outrage
if
it
were
not
for
spoiling
the
picture
she
would
quit
she
asserted
indignantly
she
thought
the
director
had
better
go
back
to
driving
a
laundry
wagon
which
was
probably
where
he
came
from
lone
agreed
with
her
even
though
he
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
he
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
but
even
so
he
could
not
travel
the
six
miles
to
the
ranch
very
quickly
he
could
see
that
the
girl
was
burning
up
with
fever
and
he
could
hear
her
voice
growing
husky
could
hear
too
the
painful
laboring
of
her
breath
when
she
was
not
mumbling
incoherent
nonsense
she
was
laughing
hoarsely
at
the
plight
she
was
in
and
after
that
she
would
hold
both
hands
to
her
chest
and
moan
in
a
way
that
made
lone
grind
his
teeth
when
he
lifted
her
off
his
horse
at
the
foreman
cottage
she
was
whispering
things
no
one
could
understand
three
cowpunchers
came
running
and
hindered
him
a
good
deal
in
carrying
her
into
the
house
and
the
foreman
wife
ran
excitedly
from
one
room
to
the
other
asking
questions
and
demanding
that
some
one
do
something
for
pity
sake
she
may
be
dying
for
all
you
know
while
you
stand
there
gawping
like
she
was
out
all
night
in
the
rain
got
lost
somehow
she
said
she
was
coming
here
so
i
brought
her
on
she
down
with
a
cold
hawkins
better
take
off
them
wet
clothes
and
put
hot
blankets
around
her
and
a
poultice
or
something
on
her
chest
i
reckon
lone
turned
to
the
door
stopped
to
roll
a
cigarette
and
watched
hawkins
hurrying
to
lorraine
with
a
whisky
toddy
the
cook
had
mixed
for
her
a
sweat
awful
good
for
a
cold
like
she
got
he
volunteered
practically
she
out
of
her
head
or
she
was
when
i
found
her
but
i
reckon
that
mostly
scare
from
being
lost
all
night
give
her
a
good
sweat
why
do
you
he
reached
the
doorstep
and
then
turned
back
to
add
she
left
a
grip
back
somewhere
along
the
road
i
go
hunt
it
up
i
reckon
he
mounted
john
doe
and
rode
down
to
the
corral
where
two
or
three
riders
were
killing
time
on
various
pretexts
while
they
waited
for
details
of
lone
adventure
delirious
young
women
of
the
class
did
not
arrive
at
the
sawtooth
every
morning
and
it
was
rumored
already
amongst
the
men
that
she
was
some
looker
which
naturally
whetted
their
interest
in
her
i
bet
it
one
of
bob
girls
come
trailin
him
up
mebby
another
of
them
cases
of
bob
hazarded
pop
bridgers
who
read
nothing
unless
it
was
printed
on
pink
paper
and
who
refused
to
believe
that
any
good
could
come
out
of
a
city
ai
that
right
loney
hai
she
a
girl
of
bob
from
the
saddle
lone
stared
down
impassively
at
pop
and
companions
i
do
know
a
thing
about
her
he
stated
emphatically
she
said
she
was
coming
to
the
ranch
and
she
was
scared
of
the
thunder
and
lightning
that
every
word
of
sense
i
could
get
outa
her
she
ai
altogether
ignorant
she
knows
how
to
climb
on
a
horse
anyway
and
she
kicked
about
having
to
ride
sideways
on
account
of
her
skirts
she
was
plumb
out
of
her
head
and
talked
wild
but
she
handled
her
reins
like
a
rider
and
she
never
mentioned
bob
nor
anybody
else
excepting
some
fellow
she
called
charlie
she
thought
i
was
him
but
she
only
talked
to
me
friendly
she
did
pull
any
love
talk
at
all
charlie
pop
ruminated
over
a
fresh
quid
of
tobacco
charlie
mebby
bob
he
stakes
himself
to
a
different
name
now
and
then
there
ai
any
charlie
except
charlie
werner
she
would
mean
him
do
yuh
charlie
werner
hunh
say
pop
she
ai
no
squaw
is
she
loney
sid
sterling
remonstrated
if
i
can
read
brands
lone
testified
she
no
girl
of
bob
a
good
honest
girl
when
she
ai
crazy
and
no
good
honest
girl
who
is
not
crazy
could
possibly
be
a
girl
of
mine
is
that
the
idea
lone
lone
turned
unhurriedly
and
looked
at
young
bob
warfield
standing
in
the
stable
door
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
that
ai
the
argument
pop
here
was
wondering
if
she
was
another
girl
of
yours
lone
grinned
unabashed
i
do
know
such
a
hell
of
a
lot
about
ladies
bob
i
ai
a
millionaire
just
making
a
guess
at
their
brand
and
it
ai
the
brand
this
little
lady
carries
bob
removed
one
hand
from
his
pocket
and
cuddled
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
if
she
a
woman
she
a
if
she
gets
the
chance
they
all
are
down
deep
in
their
tricky
hearts
there
is
a
woman
on
earth
that
wo
sell
a
man
soul
out
of
his
body
if
she
happens
to
think
worth
her
while
and
she
can
get
away
with
it
but
do
for
any
sake
call
her
that
was
pop
drawled
lone
it
do
strike
me
as
being
any
subject
for
you
fellows
to
make
remarks
about
anyway
he
advised
pop
firmly
she
a
right
nice
little
girl
and
she
pretty
darn
sick
he
touched
john
doe
with
the
spurs
and
rode
away
stopping
at
the
foreman
gate
to
finish
his
business
with
hawkins
he
was
a
conscientious
young
man
and
since
he
had
charge
of
elk
spring
camp
he
set
its
interests
above
his
own
which
was
more
than
some
of
the
sawtooth
men
would
have
done
in
his
place
having
reported
the
damage
to
the
bridge
and
made
his
suggestions
about
the
repairs
he
touched
up
john
doe
again
and
loped
away
on
a
purely
personal
matter
which
had
to
do
with
finding
the
bag
which
the
girl
had
told
him
was
under
a
bush
where
a
rabbit
had
been
sitting
if
she
had
not
been
so
very
sick
lone
would
have
laughed
at
her
naïve
method
of
identifying
the
spot
but
he
was
too
sorry
for
her
to
be
amused
at
the
vagaries
of
her
sick
brain
he
did
not
believe
anything
she
had
said
except
that
she
had
been
coming
to
the
ranch
and
had
left
her
bag
under
a
bush
beside
the
road
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
find
it
if
he
followed
the
road
and
watched
closely
the
bushes
on
either
side
until
he
reached
the
place
where
he
had
first
sighted
her
lone
rode
swiftly
anxious
to
be
through
with
the
business
and
go
his
way
but
when
he
came
upon
her
footprints
again
he
pulled
up
and
held
john
doe
to
a
walk
scanning
each
bush
and
boulder
as
he
passed
it
seemed
probable
that
she
had
left
the
grip
at
rock
city
where
she
must
have
spent
the
night
she
had
spoken
of
being
deceived
into
thinking
the
place
was
the
sawtooth
ranch
until
she
had
come
into
it
and
found
it
just
rocks
then
he
reasoned
the
storm
had
broken
and
her
fright
had
held
her
there
when
daylight
came
she
had
either
forgotten
the
bag
or
had
left
it
deliberately
at
rock
city
then
lone
stopped
to
examine
the
base
of
every
rock
even
riding
around
those
nearest
the
road
the
girl
he
guessed
shrewdly
had
not
wandered
off
the
main
highway
else
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
find
it
again
rock
city
was
confusing
unless
one
was
perfectly
familiar
with
its
curious
winding
lanes
it
was
when
he
was
riding
slowly
around
the
boulder
marked
palace
hotel
rates
reasnible
that
he
came
upon
the
place
where
a
horse
had
stood
on
the
side
best
sheltered
from
the
storm
deep
hoof
marks
closely
overlapping
an
stone
here
and
there
gave
proof
enough
and
the
soil
that
blurred
the
hoofprints
farthest
from
the
rock
told
him
more
lone
backed
away
dismounted
and
stepping
carefully
went
close
he
could
see
no
reason
why
a
horse
should
have
stood
there
with
his
head
toward
the
road
ten
feet
away
unless
his
rider
was
waiting
for
something
or
some
one
there
were
other
boulders
near
which
offered
more
shelter
from
rain
next
the
rock
he
discovered
a
boot
track
evidently
made
when
the
rider
dismounted
he
thought
of
the
wild
statement
of
the
girl
about
seeing
some
one
shoot
a
man
and
wondered
briefly
if
there
could
be
a
basis
of
truth
in
what
she
said
but
the
road
showed
no
sign
of
a
struggle
though
there
were
here
and
there
hoofprints
half
washed
out
with
the
rain
lone
went
back
to
his
horse
and
rode
on
still
looking
for
the
bag
his
search
was
thorough
and
being
a
young
man
he
discovered
the
place
where
lorraine
had
crouched
down
by
a
rock
she
must
have
stayed
there
all
night
for
the
scuffed
soil
was
dry
where
her
body
had
rested
and
her
purse
caught
in
the
juniper
bush
close
by
was
sodden
with
rain
the
poor
little
kid
he
muttered
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
he
turned
and
looked
toward
the
rock
behind
which
the
horse
had
stood
help
had
been
that
close
and
she
had
not
known
it
unless
if
anything
happened
there
last
night
she
could
have
seen
it
from
here
he
decided
and
immediately
put
the
thought
away
from
him
but
nothing
happened
he
added
unless
maybe
she
saw
him
ride
out
and
go
on
down
the
road
she
was
out
of
her
head
and
just
imagined
things
he
slipped
the
soaked
purse
into
his
coat
pocket
remounted
and
rode
on
slowly
looking
for
the
grip
and
she
had
not
been
carrying
one
but
had
dreamed
it
just
as
she
had
dreamed
that
a
man
had
been
shot
he
rode
past
the
bag
without
seeing
it
for
lorraine
had
thrust
it
far
back
under
a
stocky
bush
whose
scraggly
branches
nearly
touched
the
ground
so
he
came
at
last
to
the
creek
swollen
with
the
night
storm
so
that
it
was
swift
and
dangerous
lone
was
turning
back
when
john
doe
threw
up
his
head
stared
up
the
creek
for
a
moment
and
whinnied
shrilly
lone
stood
in
the
stirrups
and
looked
a
horse
was
standing
a
short
away
bridled
and
with
an
empty
saddle
whether
he
was
tied
or
not
lone
could
not
tell
at
that
distance
but
he
knew
the
horse
by
its
banged
forelock
and
its
white
face
and
sorrel
ears
and
he
knew
the
owner
of
the
horse
he
rode
toward
it
slowly
whoa
you
fool
he
admonished
when
the
horse
snorted
and
backed
a
step
or
two
as
he
approached
he
saw
the
dangling
broken
where
the
horse
had
stepped
on
them
in
running
broke
loose
and
run
off
again
he
said
as
he
took
down
his
rope
and
widened
the
loop
i
bet
thurman
would
sell
you
for
a
bent
nickel
this
morning
the
horse
squatted
and
jumped
when
he
cast
the
loop
and
then
stood
quivering
and
snorting
while
lone
dismounted
and
started
toward
him
ten
steps
from
the
horse
lone
stopped
short
staring
for
down
in
the
bushes
on
the
farther
side
half
lay
half
hung
the
limp
form
of
a
man
chapter
five
a
death
by
accident
lone
morgan
was
a
virginian
by
birth
though
few
of
his
acquaintances
knew
it
lone
never
talked
of
himself
except
as
his
personal
history
touched
a
common
interest
with
his
fellows
but
until
he
was
seventeen
he
had
lived
very
close
to
the
center
of
one
of
the
deadliest
feuds
of
the
blue
ridge
that
he
had
been
neutral
was
merely
an
accident
of
birth
perhaps
and
that
he
had
not
become
involved
in
the
quarrel
that
raged
among
his
neighbors
was
the
direct
result
of
a
genius
for
holding
his
tongue
he
had
attended
the
funerals
of
men
shot
down
in
their
own
dooryards
he
had
witnessed
the
trials
of
the
killers
he
had
grown
up
with
the
settled
conviction
that
other
men
quarrels
did
not
concern
him
so
long
as
he
was
not
directly
involved
and
that
what
did
not
concern
him
he
had
no
right
to
discuss
if
he
stood
aside
and
let
violence
stalk
by
unhindered
he
was
merely
doing
what
he
had
been
taught
to
do
from
the
time
he
could
walk
mind
your
own
business
and
let
other
folks
do
the
same
had
been
the
family
slogan
in
lone
home
there
had
been
nothing
in
lone
later
life
to
convince
him
that
minding
his
own
business
was
not
a
very
good
habit
it
had
grown
to
be
second
nature
and
it
had
made
him
a
good
man
for
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
to
have
on
its
pay
roll
just
now
lone
was
stirred
beyond
his
usual
depth
of
emotion
and
it
was
not
altogether
the
sight
of
fred
thurman
battered
body
that
unnerved
him
he
wanted
to
believe
that
thurman
death
was
purely
an
accident
the
accident
it
appeared
but
lorraine
and
the
telltale
hoofprints
by
the
rock
compelled
him
to
believe
that
it
was
not
an
accident
he
knew
that
if
he
examined
carefully
enough
fred
body
he
would
find
the
mark
of
a
bullet
he
was
tempted
to
look
and
yet
he
did
not
want
to
know
it
was
no
business
of
his
it
would
be
foolish
to
let
it
become
his
business
he
too
dead
to
care
now
how
it
happened
and
it
would
only
stir
up
trouble
he
finally
decided
and
turned
his
eyes
away
he
pulled
the
twisted
foot
from
the
stirrup
left
the
body
where
it
lay
and
led
the
horse
to
a
tree
and
tied
it
securely
he
took
off
his
coat
and
spread
it
over
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
dead
man
weighted
the
edges
with
rocks
and
rode
away
halfway
up
the
hill
he
left
the
road
and
took
a
narrow
trail
through
the
sage
a
that
would
save
him
a
couple
of
miles
the
trail
crossed
the
ridge
half
a
mile
beyond
rock
city
dipping
into
the
lower
end
of
the
small
gulch
where
he
had
overtaken
the
girl
the
place
recalled
with
fresh
vividness
her
first
words
to
him
are
the
man
i
saw
shoot
that
other
man
and
fasten
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
lone
shivered
and
threw
away
the
cigarette
he
had
just
lighted
my
god
that
girl
must
tell
that
to
any
one
else
he
exclaimed
apprehensively
no
matter
who
she
is
or
what
she
is
she
must
tell
that
hello
who
you
talking
to
i
heard
somebody
talking
the
bushes
parted
above
a
low
rocky
ledge
and
a
face
peered
out
smiling
lone
started
a
little
and
pulled
up
oh
hello
swan
i
was
just
telling
this
horse
of
mine
all
i
was
going
to
do
to
him
say
you
a
chancey
bird
swan
yelling
from
the
brush
like
that
some
folks
woulda
taken
a
shot
at
you
then
they
hit
me
sure
swan
observed
letting
himself
down
into
the
trail
he
too
was
wet
from
his
hat
crown
to
his
shoes
that
squelched
when
he
landed
lightly
on
his
toes
anybody
would
be
ashamed
to
shoot
at
a
mark
so
large
as
i
am
i
say
they
poor
shooters
and
he
added
irrelevantly
as
he
held
up
a
grayish
pelt
i
got
that
coyote
i
been
chasing
for
two
weeks
he
was
sure
smart
he
had
me
guessing
but
i
made
him
guess
some
maybe
he
guessed
wrong
this
time
lone
eyes
narrowed
while
he
looked
swan
over
you
must
have
been
out
all
night
he
said
you
crazier
about
hunting
than
i
am
wet
bushes
swan
corrected
carelessly
i
been
tramping
since
daylight
it
my
work
to
hunt
like
it
your
work
to
ride
he
had
swung
into
the
trail
ahead
of
john
doe
and
was
walking
with
long
strides
the
tallest
straightest
limberest
young
swede
in
all
the
country
he
had
the
bluest
eyes
the
readiest
smile
the
healthiest
color
the
sunniest
hair
and
disposition
the
sawtooth
country
had
seen
for
many
a
day
he
had
homesteaded
an
claim
on
the
south
side
of
bear
top
and
had
by
that
means
gained
possession
of
two
living
springs
and
the
only
accessible
portion
of
wilder
creek
where
it
crossed
the
meadow
called
skyline
before
it
plunged
into
a
gulch
too
narrow
for
cattle
to
water
with
any
safety
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
had
for
years
covered
that
patch
of
government
land
never
dreaming
that
any
one
would
ever
file
on
it
swan
vjolmar
was
there
and
had
his
log
cabin
roofed
and
ready
for
the
door
and
windows
before
the
sawtooth
discovered
his
presence
now
nearly
a
year
afterwards
he
was
accepted
in
a
tolerant
spirit
he
had
not
objected
to
the
sawtooth
cattle
which
still
watered
at
skyline
meadow
he
was
a
government
hunter
and
he
had
killed
many
coyotes
and
lynx
and
even
a
mountain
lion
or
two
lone
wondered
sometimes
what
the
sawtooth
meant
to
do
about
the
swede
but
so
far
the
sawtooth
seemed
inclined
to
do
nothing
at
all
evidently
thinking
his
war
on
animal
pests
more
than
atoned
for
his
effrontery
in
taking
skyline
as
a
homestead
when
he
had
proven
up
on
his
claim
they
would
probably
buy
him
out
and
have
the
water
still
well
what
do
you
know
swan
turned
his
head
to
inquire
abruptly
you
pretty
quiet
lone
roused
himself
fred
thurman
been
dragged
to
death
by
that
damned
flighty
horse
of
his
he
said
i
found
him
in
the
brush
this
side
of
granite
creek
had
his
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
i
thought
best
leave
him
there
till
the
coroner
can
view
him
swan
stopped
short
in
the
trail
and
turned
facing
lone
last
night
my
dog
yack
whines
to
go
out
he
went
and
sat
in
a
place
where
he
looks
down
on
the
walley
and
he
howled
for
half
an
hour
i
said
then
that
somebody
in
the
walley
has
died
that
dog
is
something
queer
about
it
he
knows
things
i
going
to
the
sawtooth
lone
told
him
i
can
telephone
to
the
coroner
from
there
anybody
at
thurman
place
do
you
know
swan
shook
his
head
and
started
again
down
the
winding
steep
trail
i
do
hunt
over
that
way
for
maybe
a
week
that
too
bad
he
killed
i
like
fred
thurman
he
a
fine
man
you
bet
he
was
said
lone
soberly
it
a
damn
shame
he
had
to
go
like
that
swan
glanced
back
at
him
studied
lone
face
for
an
instant
and
turned
into
a
tributary
gully
where
a
stream
trickled
down
over
rocks
here
i
leave
you
he
volunteered
as
lone
came
abreast
of
him
a
coyote
crossed
up
there
and
i
maybe
find
his
tracks
i
could
go
do
chores
for
fred
thurman
if
nobody
there
should
i
do
that
what
you
say
lone
you
might
drift
around
by
there
if
it
ai
too
much
out
of
your
way
and
see
if
he
got
a
man
on
the
ranch
lone
suggested
but
you
better
not
touch
anything
in
the
house
swan
the
coroner
likely
appoint
somebody
to
look
around
and
see
if
he
got
any
folks
to
send
his
stuff
to
just
feed
any
stock
that
kept
up
if
nobody
there
all
right
swan
agreed
readily
i
do
that
lone
lone
nodded
and
watched
him
climb
the
steep
slope
of
the
gulch
on
the
side
toward
thurman
ranch
swan
climbed
swiftly
seeming
to
take
no
thought
of
where
he
put
his
feet
yet
never
once
slipping
or
slowing
in
two
minutes
he
was
out
of
sight
and
lone
rode
on
moodily
trying
not
to
think
of
fred
thurman
trying
to
shut
from
his
mind
the
things
that
girl
had
told
him
lone
you
mind
your
own
business
he
advised
himself
once
you
know
anything
that
going
to
do
any
one
any
good
and
what
you
know
there
no
good
guessing
but
that
girl
she
must
talk
like
that
of
swan
he
scarcely
gave
a
thought
after
the
swede
had
disappeared
yet
swan
was
worth
a
thought
or
two
even
from
a
man
who
was
bent
on
minding
his
own
business
swan
had
no
sooner
climbed
the
gulch
toward
claim
than
he
proceeded
to
descend
rather
carefully
to
the
bottom
again
walk
along
on
the
rocks
for
some
distance
and
climb
to
the
ridge
whose
farther
slope
led
down
to
granite
creek
he
did
not
follow
the
trail
but
struck
straight
across
an
outcropping
ledge
descended
to
granite
creek
and
strode
along
next
the
hill
where
the
soil
was
gravelly
and
barren
when
he
had
gone
some
distance
he
sat
down
and
took
from
under
his
coat
two
huge
crudely
made
moccasins
of
coyote
skin
these
he
pulled
on
over
his
shoes
tied
them
around
his
ankles
and
went
on
still
keeping
close
under
the
hill
he
reached
the
place
where
fred
thurman
lay
stood
well
away
from
the
body
and
studied
every
detail
closely
then
stepping
carefully
on
trampled
brush
and
rocks
he
approached
and
cautiously
lifted
coat
it
was
not
a
pretty
sight
but
swan
interest
held
him
there
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
his
eyes
leaving
the
body
only
when
the
horse
moved
then
swan
would
look
up
quickly
at
the
horse
seem
reassured
when
he
saw
that
the
animal
was
not
watching
anything
at
a
distance
and
return
to
his
curious
task
finally
he
drew
the
coat
back
over
the
head
and
shoulders
placed
each
stone
exactly
as
he
had
found
it
and
went
up
to
the
horse
examining
the
saddle
rather
closely
after
that
he
retreated
as
carefully
as
he
had
approached
when
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
or
so
upstream
he
found
a
place
where
he
could
wash
his
hands
without
wetting
his
moccasins
returned
to
the
rocky
hillside
and
took
off
the
clumsy
footgear
and
stowed
them
away
under
his
coat
then
with
long
strides
that
covered
the
ground
as
fast
as
a
horse
could
do
without
loping
swan
headed
as
straight
as
might
be
for
the
thurman
ranch
about
noon
swan
approached
the
crowd
of
men
and
a
few
women
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
and
whispered
together
with
their
faces
averted
from
the
body
around
which
the
men
stood
grouped
the
news
had
spread
as
such
news
will
even
in
a
country
so
sparsely
settled
as
the
sawtooth
swan
counted
forty
men
he
did
not
bother
with
the
women
fred
thurman
had
been
known
to
every
one
of
them
some
one
had
spread
a
piece
of
canvas
over
the
corpse
and
swan
did
not
go
very
near
the
horse
had
been
led
farther
away
and
tied
to
a
cottonwood
where
some
one
had
thrown
down
a
bundle
of
hay
the
sawtooth
country
was
rather
punctilious
in
its
duty
toward
the
law
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
coroner
would
want
to
see
the
horse
that
had
caused
the
tragedy
half
an
hour
after
swan
arrived
the
coroner
came
in
a
machine
and
with
him
came
the
sheriff
the
coroner
an
important
little
man
examined
the
body
the
horse
and
the
saddle
and
there
was
the
usual
formula
of
swearing
in
a
jury
the
inquest
was
rather
short
since
there
was
only
one
witness
to
testify
and
lone
merely
told
how
he
had
discovered
the
horse
there
by
the
creek
and
that
the
body
had
not
been
moved
from
where
he
found
it
swan
went
over
to
where
lone
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
place
was
untying
his
horse
after
the
jury
had
officially
named
the
death
an
accident
i
guess
those
horses
could
be
turned
loose
he
began
without
prelude
what
you
think
lone
i
been
to
thurman
ranch
and
i
do
find
anybody
some
horses
in
a
corral
and
pigs
in
a
pen
and
chickens
i
guess
thurman
was
living
alone
should
i
tell
the
coroner
that
i
dunno
lone
replied
shortly
you
might
speak
to
the
sheriff
i
reckon
he
the
man
to
take
charge
of
things
it
bad
business
getting
killed
swan
said
vaguely
it
makes
me
feel
damn
sorry
when
i
go
to
that
ranch
there
the
horses
waiting
for
breakfast
and
thurman
he
dead
over
here
and
ca
feed
his
pigs
and
his
chickens
it
a
white
cat
over
there
that
comes
to
meet
me
and
rubs
my
leg
and
purrs
like
it
lonesome
that
a
nice
ranch
he
got
too
now
what
becomes
of
that
ranch
what
you
think
lone
hell
how
should
i
know
lone
scowled
at
him
from
the
saddle
and
rode
away
leaving
swan
standing
there
staring
after
him
he
turned
away
to
find
the
sheriff
and
almost
collided
with
brit
hunter
who
was
glancing
speculatively
from
him
to
lone
morgan
swan
stopped
and
put
out
his
hand
to
shake
lone
says
i
should
tell
the
sheriff
i
could
look
after
fred
ranch
what
you
think
mr
hunter
good
idea
i
guess
somebody
have
to
they
ca
he
checked
himself
you
got
a
horse
i
ride
over
with
yuh
maybe
i
got
legs
swan
returned
laconically
they
do
get
scared
hunter
and
maybe
kill
me
sometime
you
could
tell
the
sheriff
government
hunter
and
honest
man
and
i
take
good
care
of
things
you
could
do
that
please
sure
said
brit
and
rode
over
to
where
the
sheriff
was
standing
the
sheriff
listened
nodded
beckoned
to
swan
the
court
have
to
settle
up
the
estate
and
find
his
heirs
if
he
got
any
but
you
look
after
things
what
your
name
vjolmar
how
yuh
spell
it
i
swear
you
in
as
a
deputy
good
lord
you
a
husky
the
sheriff
eyes
went
up
to
swan
hat
crown
descended
to
his
shoulders
and
lingered
there
admiringly
for
a
moment
traveled
down
his
flat
body
and
his
straight
legs
i
bet
you
could
put
up
some
fight
if
you
had
to
he
commented
swan
grinned
glanced
at
the
covered
figure
on
the
ground
and
straightened
his
face
decorously
i
could
lick
you
good
he
admitted
in
a
stage
whisper
i
a
all
right
only
i
do
never
get
mad
at
somebody
brit
hunter
smiled
at
that
it
was
so
like
swan
vjolmar
but
when
they
were
halfway
to
thurman
ranch
brit
on
horseback
and
swan
striding
easily
along
beside
him
leading
the
horse
he
glanced
down
at
swan
face
and
wondered
if
swan
had
not
lied
a
little
what
on
your
mind
swan
he
asked
abruptly
swan
started
and
looked
up
at
him
glanced
at
the
empty
hills
on
either
side
and
stopped
still
in
the
trail
hunter
you
been
longer
in
the
country
than
i
have
been
you
seen
some
good
riding
i
bet
maybe
you
see
some
men
ride
backwards
on
a
horse
brit
looked
at
him
uncomprehendingly
backwards
swan
led
up
the
horse
and
pointed
to
the
right
stirrup
spurs
would
scratch
like
that
if
you
jerk
your
foot
maybe
you
a
good
rider
hunter
you
can
tell
that
a
right
stirrup
ai
it
fred
thurman
he
got
his
left
foot
twist
around
all
broke
from
jerking
in
his
stirrup
left
foot
in
right
stirrup
he
pushed
back
his
hat
and
rumpled
his
yellow
hair
looking
up
into
brit
face
inquiringly
left
foot
in
right
stirrup
is
riding
backwards
that
a
damn
good
rider
to
ride
like
that
what
you
think
mr
hunter
chapter
six
lone
advises
silence
twice
in
the
next
week
lone
found
an
excuse
for
riding
over
to
the
sawtooth
during
his
first
visit
the
foreman
wife
told
him
that
the
young
lady
was
still
too
sick
to
talk
much
the
second
time
he
went
pop
bridgers
spied
him
first
and
cackled
over
his
coming
to
see
the
girl
lone
grinned
and
dissembled
as
best
he
could
knowing
that
pop
bridgers
fed
his
imagination
upon
denials
and
argument
and
remonstrance
and
was
likely
to
build
gossip
that
might
spread
beyond
the
sawtooth
wherefore
he
did
not
go
near
the
foreman
house
that
day
but
contented
himself
with
gathering
from
pop
talk
that
the
girl
was
still
there
after
that
he
rode
here
and
there
wherever
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
a
sawtooth
rider
and
so
at
last
he
came
upon
al
woodruff
loping
along
the
crest
of
juniper
ridge
al
at
first
displayed
no
intention
of
stopping
but
pulled
up
when
he
saw
john
doe
slowing
down
significantly
lone
would
have
preferred
a
chat
with
some
one
else
for
this
was
a
man
but
al
woodruff
stayed
at
the
ranch
and
would
know
all
the
news
and
even
though
he
might
give
it
an
twist
lone
would
at
least
know
what
was
going
on
al
hailed
him
with
a
laughing
epithet
say
you
sure
enough
played
hell
all
around
bringin
brit
girl
to
the
sawtooth
he
began
chuckling
as
if
he
had
some
secret
joke
where
you
pick
her
up
lone
she
claims
you
found
her
at
rock
city
that
right
no
it
ai
right
lone
denied
promptly
his
dark
eyes
meeting
glance
steadily
i
found
her
in
that
gulch
away
this
side
she
was
in
amongst
the
rocks
where
she
was
trying
to
keep
outa
the
rain
brit
hunter
girl
is
she
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
the
sawtooth
have
made
it
too
if
it
had
been
for
the
storm
she
got
as
far
as
the
gulch
and
the
lightning
scared
her
from
going
any
farther
he
offered
al
his
tobacco
sack
and
fumbled
for
a
match
i
never
knew
brit
hunter
had
a
girl
nor
me
al
said
and
sifted
tobacco
into
a
cigarette
paper
bob
he
drove
her
over
there
yesterday
took
him
close
to
all
day
to
make
the
trip
and
bob
he
claims
to
hate
women
so
would
i
if
i
got
stung
for
fifty
thousand
she
ai
that
kind
she
a
nice
girl
far
as
i
could
tell
she
got
well
all
right
did
she
yeah
only
she
was
still
coughing
some
when
she
left
the
ranch
she
like
to
of
had
pneumonia
i
guess
queer
how
she
claimed
she
spent
the
night
in
rock
city
ai
it
no
lone
answered
judicially
i
do
know
as
it
so
queer
she
never
realized
how
far
she
walked
i
reckon
she
was
plumb
crazy
when
i
found
her
you
could
take
any
stock
in
what
she
said
say
you
did
see
that
bay
i
was
did
yuh
al
he
jumped
the
fence
and
got
away
on
me
day
before
yesterday
i
like
to
catch
him
up
again
he
make
a
good
horse
al
had
not
seen
the
bay
and
the
talk
tapered
off
desultorily
to
a
final
see
yuh
later
lone
rode
on
careful
not
to
look
back
so
she
was
brit
hunter
girl
lone
whistled
softly
to
himself
while
he
studied
this
new
angle
of
the
problem
for
a
problem
he
was
beginning
to
consider
it
she
was
brit
hunter
girl
and
she
had
told
them
at
the
sawtooth
that
she
had
spent
the
night
at
rock
city
he
wondered
how
much
else
she
had
told
how
much
she
remembered
of
what
she
had
told
him
he
reached
into
his
coat
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
round
leather
purse
with
a
chain
handle
it
was
soiled
and
shrunken
with
its
wetting
and
the
clasp
had
flecks
of
rust
upon
it
what
it
contained
lone
did
not
know
virginia
had
taught
him
that
a
man
must
not
be
curious
about
the
personal
belongings
of
a
woman
now
he
turned
the
purse
over
tried
to
rub
out
the
stiffness
of
the
leather
and
smiled
a
little
as
he
dropped
it
back
into
his
pocket
i
got
my
calling
card
he
said
softly
to
john
doe
i
reckon
i
had
the
right
hunch
when
i
did
turn
it
over
to
hawkins
i
ask
her
again
about
that
grip
she
said
she
hid
under
a
bush
i
never
heard
about
any
of
the
boys
finding
it
his
thoughts
returned
to
al
woodruff
and
stopped
there
determined
still
to
attend
strictly
to
his
own
affairs
his
thoughts
persisted
in
playing
truant
and
in
straying
to
a
subject
he
much
preferred
not
to
think
of
at
all
why
should
al
woodruff
be
interested
in
the
exact
spot
where
brit
hunter
daughter
had
spent
the
night
of
the
storm
why
should
lone
instinctively
discount
her
statement
and
lie
about
it
now
if
al
catches
me
up
in
that
he
think
i
know
a
lot
i
do
know
or
else
he
halted
his
thoughts
there
for
that
too
was
a
forbidden
subject
forbidden
subjects
are
like
other
forbidden
things
they
have
a
way
of
making
themselves
very
conspicuous
lone
was
heading
for
the
quirt
ranch
by
the
most
direct
route
fearing
perhaps
that
if
he
waited
he
would
lose
his
nerve
and
would
not
go
at
all
yet
it
was
important
that
he
should
go
he
must
return
the
girl
purse
the
most
direct
route
to
the
quirt
took
him
down
juniper
ridge
and
across
granite
creek
near
the
thurman
ranch
indeed
if
he
followed
the
trail
up
granite
creek
and
across
the
hilly
country
to
quirt
creek
he
must
pass
within
fifty
yards
of
the
thurman
cabin
lone
time
was
limited
yet
he
took
the
direct
route
rather
reluctantly
he
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
too
sharply
of
fred
thurman
as
a
man
who
had
lived
his
life
in
his
own
way
and
had
died
so
horribly
well
he
did
have
it
coming
to
him
but
it
done
and
over
with
now
so
it
no
use
thinking
about
it
he
reflected
when
the
roofs
of
the
thurman
ranch
buildings
began
to
show
now
and
then
through
the
thin
ranks
of
the
cottonwoods
along
the
creek
but
his
face
sobered
as
he
rode
along
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sleepy
little
meadows
the
quiet
murmuring
of
the
creek
even
the
soft
rustling
of
the
cottonwood
leaves
breathed
a
new
loneliness
an
emptiness
where
the
man
who
had
called
this
place
home
who
had
clung
to
it
in
the
face
of
opposition
that
was
growing
into
open
warfare
had
lived
and
had
left
life
suddenly
unwarrantably
lone
knew
in
his
heart
it
might
be
of
no
use
to
think
about
it
but
the
vivid
memory
of
fred
thurman
was
with
him
when
he
rode
up
the
trail
to
the
stable
and
the
small
corrals
he
had
to
think
whether
he
would
or
no
at
the
corral
he
came
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
the
swede
who
grinned
a
guileless
welcome
and
came
toward
him
so
that
lone
could
not
ride
on
unless
he
would
advertise
his
dislike
of
the
place
john
doe
plainly
glad
to
find
an
excuse
to
stop
slowed
and
came
to
where
swan
waited
by
the
gate
by
golly
this
is
lonesome
here
swan
complained
heaving
a
great
sigh
that
judge
do
get
busy
pretty
quick
i
maybe
jumping
my
job
lone
what
you
think
you
believe
in
ghosts
naw
what
on
your
chest
swan
lone
slipped
sidewise
in
the
saddle
resting
his
muscles
you
been
seeing
things
no
i
do
be
seeing
things
lone
but
sometimes
i
been
like
i
something
he
stared
at
lone
questioningly
what
you
think
lone
if
you
be
sitting
down
eating
your
supper
maybe
and
you
feel
something
say
words
in
your
brain
like
you
know
something
talks
to
you
and
then
quits
lone
gave
swan
a
long
measuring
look
and
swan
laughed
uneasily
that
sounds
crazy
but
it
true
what
something
tells
me
in
my
brain
i
go
and
look
and
by
golly
it
there
just
like
the
words
tell
me
lone
straightened
in
the
saddle
you
better
come
clean
swan
and
tell
the
whole
thing
what
was
it
do
talk
in
circles
what
words
did
you
feel
in
your
brain
in
spite
of
himself
lone
felt
as
he
had
when
the
girl
had
talked
to
him
and
called
him
charlie
swan
closed
the
gate
behind
him
with
steady
hands
his
lips
were
pressed
firmly
together
as
if
he
had
definitely
made
up
his
mind
to
something
lone
was
impressed
somehow
with
swan
perfect
control
of
his
speech
his
thoughts
his
actions
but
he
was
puzzled
rather
than
anything
else
and
when
swan
turned
facing
him
lone
bewilderment
did
not
lessen
i
tell
you
it
when
i
sitting
down
to
eat
my
supper
i
just
reaching
out
my
hand
like
this
to
get
my
coffee
and
something
says
in
my
head
a
lie
i
do
ride
backwards
go
look
at
my
saddle
there
blood
and
that
all
it
like
the
words
go
far
away
so
i
ca
hear
any
more
so
i
eat
my
supper
and
then
i
get
the
lantern
and
i
go
look
you
come
with
me
lone
i
show
you
without
a
word
lone
dismounted
and
followed
swan
into
a
small
shed
beside
the
stable
where
a
worn
stock
saddle
hung
suspended
from
a
crosspiece
a
rawhide
string
looped
over
the
horn
lone
did
not
ask
whose
saddle
it
was
nor
did
swan
name
the
owner
there
was
no
need
swan
took
the
saddle
and
swung
it
around
so
that
the
right
side
was
toward
them
it
was
what
is
called
a
saddle
with
the
popular
design
on
skirts
and
cantle
much
hard
use
and
occasional
oilings
had
darkened
the
leather
to
a
rich
red
brown
marred
with
old
scars
and
scratches
and
the
stains
of
many
storms
blood
is
hard
to
find
when
it
raining
all
night
swan
observed
speaking
low
as
one
does
in
the
presence
of
death
but
if
somebody
is
bleeding
and
falls
off
a
horse
slow
and
catches
hold
of
things
and
tries
like
hell
to
hang
on
he
lifted
the
small
flap
that
covered
the
cinch
ring
and
revealed
a
reddish
flaked
stain
phlegmatically
he
wetted
his
finger
tip
on
his
tongue
rubbed
the
stain
and
held
up
his
finger
for
lone
to
see
that
a
damn
funny
place
for
blood
when
a
man
is
dragging
on
the
ground
he
commented
drily
and
something
else
is
damn
funny
lone
he
lifted
the
wooden
stirrup
and
touched
with
his
finger
the
rowel
marks
that
is
on
the
front
part
he
said
i
could
swear
in
court
that
fred
left
foot
was
twisted
that
damn
funny
lone
i
do
see
men
ride
backwards
much
lone
turned
on
him
and
struck
the
stirrup
from
his
hand
i
think
you
better
forget
it
he
said
fiercely
he
dead
it
ca
help
him
any
to
he
stopped
and
pulled
himself
together
swan
you
take
a
advice
and
do
tell
anybody
else
about
feeling
words
talk
in
your
head
they
have
you
in
the
at
blackfoot
sure
as
you
live
he
looked
at
the
saddle
hesitated
looked
again
at
swan
who
was
watching
him
that
blood
most
likely
got
there
when
fred
was
packing
a
deer
in
from
the
hills
and
marks
on
them
old
oxbow
stirrups
do
mean
a
damn
thing
but
the
need
of
a
new
pair
maybe
he
forced
a
laugh
and
stepped
outside
the
shed
just
shows
you
swan
that
imagination
and
being
alone
all
the
time
can
raise
cain
with
a
fellow
you
want
to
watch
yourself
swan
followed
him
out
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
by
golly
i
watching
out
now
he
assented
thoughtfully
you
do
tell
anybody
lone
no
i
wo
tell
anybody
and
i
advise
you
not
to
lone
repeated
grimly
just
keep
those
thoughts
outa
your
head
swan
they
bad
medicine
he
mounted
john
doe
and
rode
away
his
eyes
downcast
his
quirt
slapping
absently
the
weeds
along
the
trail
it
was
not
his
business
and
yet
lone
shook
himself
together
and
put
john
doe
into
a
lope
he
had
warned
swan
and
he
could
do
no
more
halfway
to
the
quirt
he
met
lorraine
riding
along
the
trail
she
would
have
passed
him
with
no
sign
of
recognition
but
lone
lifted
his
hat
and
stopped
lorraine
looked
at
him
rode
on
a
few
steps
and
turned
did
you
wish
to
speak
about
something
she
asked
impersonally
lone
felt
the
flush
in
his
cheeks
which
angered
him
to
the
point
of
speaking
curtly
yes
i
found
your
purse
where
you
dropped
it
that
night
you
were
lost
i
was
bringing
it
over
to
you
my
name
morgan
i
the
man
that
found
you
and
took
you
in
to
the
ranch
oh
lorraine
looked
at
him
steadily
you
the
one
they
call
loney
when
they
feeling
good
toward
me
i
lone
morgan
i
went
back
to
find
your
grip
you
said
you
left
it
under
a
bush
but
the
world
plumb
full
of
bushes
i
found
your
purse
though
thank
you
so
much
i
must
have
been
an
awful
nuisance
but
i
was
so
scared
and
things
were
terribly
mixed
in
my
mind
i
did
even
have
sense
enough
to
tell
you
what
ranch
i
was
trying
to
find
did
i
so
you
took
me
to
the
wrong
one
and
i
was
a
week
there
before
i
found
it
out
and
then
they
were
perfectly
lovely
about
it
and
brought
me
home
she
turned
the
purse
over
and
over
in
her
hands
looking
at
it
without
much
interest
she
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
ride
on
which
gave
lone
courage
there
something
i
like
to
say
he
began
groping
for
words
that
would
make
his
meaning
plain
without
telling
too
much
i
hope
you
mind
my
telling
you
you
were
kinda
out
of
your
head
when
i
found
you
and
you
said
something
about
seeing
a
man
shot
and
oh
lorraine
looked
up
at
him
looked
through
him
he
thought
with
those
brilliant
eyes
of
hers
then
i
did
tell
i
just
wanted
to
say
lone
interrupted
her
that
i
knew
all
the
time
it
was
just
a
nightmare
i
never
mentioned
it
to
anybody
and
forget
all
about
it
i
hope
you
did
tell
any
one
else
did
you
he
looked
up
at
her
again
and
found
her
studying
him
curiously
not
the
man
i
saw
she
said
as
if
she
were
satisfying
herself
on
that
point
i
wondered
since
but
i
was
sure
too
that
i
had
seen
it
why
must
i
tell
any
one
lone
did
not
reply
at
once
the
girl
eyes
were
disconcertingly
direct
her
voice
and
her
manner
disturbed
him
with
their
judicial
calmness
so
at
variance
with
the
wildness
he
remembered
well
it
hard
to
explain
he
said
at
last
you
strange
to
this
country
and
you
do
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
things
it
do
any
good
to
you
or
anybody
else
and
it
might
do
a
lot
of
harm
his
eyes
nicked
her
face
with
a
wistful
glance
you
do
know
me
i
really
have
got
any
right
to
ask
or
expect
you
to
trust
me
but
i
wish
you
would
to
the
extent
of
forgetting
that
you
saw
or
thought
you
saw
anything
that
night
in
rock
city
lorraine
shivered
and
covered
her
eyes
swiftly
with
one
hand
his
words
had
brought
back
too
sharply
that
scene
but
she
shook
off
the
emotion
and
faced
him
again
i
saw
a
man
murdered
she
cried
i
was
sure
afterwards
sometimes
i
thought
i
had
dreamed
it
but
i
was
sure
i
saw
it
i
saw
the
horse
go
by
running
and
you
want
me
to
keep
still
about
that
what
harm
could
it
do
to
tell
perhaps
it
true
perhaps
i
did
see
it
all
i
might
think
you
were
trying
to
cover
up
something
only
you
not
the
man
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
no
of
course
i
not
you
dreamed
the
whole
thing
and
the
way
you
talked
to
me
was
so
wild
folks
would
say
you
crazy
if
they
heard
you
tell
it
you
a
stranger
here
miss
hunter
and
your
father
is
not
as
popular
in
this
country
as
he
might
be
he
got
enemies
that
would
be
glad
of
the
chance
to
stir
up
trouble
for
him
you
just
dreamed
all
that
i
asking
you
to
forget
a
bad
dream
that
all
and
not
go
telling
it
to
other
folks
for
some
time
lorraine
did
not
answer
the
horses
conversed
with
sundry
nibbled
idly
at
convenient
brush
tips
and
wondered
no
doubt
why
their
riders
were
so
silent
lone
tried
to
think
of
some
stronger
argument
some
appeal
that
would
reach
the
girl
without
frightening
her
or
causing
her
to
distrust
him
but
he
did
not
know
what
more
he
could
say
without
telling
her
what
must
not
be
told
just
how
would
it
make
trouble
for
my
father
lorraine
asked
at
last
i
ca
believe
you
ask
me
to
help
cover
up
a
crime
but
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
a
nightmare
would
cause
any
great
commotion
and
why
is
my
father
unpopular
well
you
do
know
this
country
lone
parried
inexpertly
it
all
right
in
some
ways
and
in
some
ways
it
could
be
a
lot
improved
folks
have
got
much
to
talk
about
they
go
around
gabbling
their
heads
off
about
every
little
thing
and
adding
onto
it
until
you
ca
recognize
your
own
remarks
after
they
been
peddled
for
a
week
you
maybe
seen
places
like
that
oh
yes
lorraine
eyes
lighted
with
a
smile
take
a
movie
studio
for
instance
yes
well
you
being
a
stranger
you
would
get
all
the
worst
of
it
i
just
thought
i
tell
you
i
hate
to
see
you
misunderstood
by
folks
around
here
i
i
feel
kinda
responsible
for
you
i
the
one
that
found
you
lorraine
eyes
twinkled
well
i
glad
to
know
one
person
in
the
country
who
does
gabble
his
head
off
you
have
answered
any
of
my
questions
and
you
made
me
feel
as
if
you
found
a
dangerous
wild
woman
that
morning
it
is
very
flattering
but
i
think
you
honest
anyway
lone
smiled
for
the
first
time
and
she
found
his
smile
pleasant
no
angel
he
disclaimed
modestly
and
most
folks
think
i
could
be
improved
on
a
whole
lot
but
i
honest
in
one
way
i
thinking
about
what
best
for
you
this
time
i
terribly
grateful
lorraine
laughed
i
shall
take
great
care
not
to
go
all
around
the
country
telling
people
my
dreams
i
can
see
that
it
would
make
me
awfully
popular
then
she
sobered
morgan
that
was
a
kind
of
nightmare
why
even
last
night
i
woke
up
shivering
just
imagining
it
all
over
again
it
was
sure
horrible
the
way
you
talked
about
it
lone
assured
her
it
because
you
were
sick
i
reckon
i
wish
you
tell
me
as
close
as
you
can
where
you
left
that
grip
of
yours
you
said
it
was
under
a
bush
where
a
rabbit
was
sitting
i
like
to
find
the
grip
but
i
afraid
that
rabbit
has
done
moved
oh
warfield
and
i
found
it
thank
you
the
rabbit
had
moved
but
i
sort
of
remembered
how
the
road
had
looked
along
there
and
we
hunted
until
we
discovered
the
place
dad
has
driven
in
after
my
other
luggage
and
i
believe
i
must
be
getting
home
i
was
only
out
for
a
little
ride
she
thanked
him
again
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
and
rode
away
lone
turned
off
the
trail
and
picking
his
way
around
rough
outcroppings
of
rock
and
across
unexpected
little
gullies
headed
straight
for
the
ford
across
granite
creek
and
home
brit
hunter
girl
he
was
thinking
was
even
nicer
than
he
had
pictured
her
and
that
she
could
believe
in
the
nightmare
was
a
vast
relief
chapter
seven
the
man
at
whisper
brit
hunter
finished
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
and
put
a
stick
of
wood
into
the
broken
old
that
had
served
him
and
frank
for
fifteen
years
and
was
feeling
its
age
lorraine
breakfast
was
in
the
oven
keeping
warm
brit
looked
in
tested
the
heat
with
his
gnarled
hand
to
make
sure
that
the
biscuits
would
not
be
dried
to
crusts
and
closed
the
door
upon
them
and
the
bacon
and
fried
potatoes
frank
johnson
had
the
horses
saddled
and
it
was
time
to
go
yet
brit
lingered
uneasily
conscious
that
his
habitation
was
lacking
in
many
things
which
a
beautiful
young
woman
might
consider
absolute
necessities
he
had
seen
in
lorraine
eyes
as
they
glanced
here
and
there
about
the
grimy
walls
a
certain
disparagement
of
her
surroundings
the
look
had
made
him
wince
though
he
could
not
quite
decide
what
it
was
that
displeased
her
maybe
she
wanted
lace
curtains
or
something
he
set
the
four
chairs
in
a
row
against
the
wall
swept
up
the
bits
of
bark
and
ashes
beside
the
stove
made
sure
that
the
water
bucket
was
standing
full
on
its
bench
beside
the
door
sent
another
critical
glance
around
the
room
and
tiptoed
over
to
the
dish
cupboard
and
let
down
the
flowered
calico
curtain
that
had
been
looped
up
over
a
nail
for
convenience
the
sun
sent
a
bright
wide
bar
of
yellow
light
across
the
room
to
rest
on
the
shelf
behind
the
stove
where
stood
the
salt
can
the
soda
the
teapot
a
box
of
matches
and
two
pepper
cans
one
empty
and
the
other
full
brit
always
meant
to
throw
out
that
empty
pepper
can
and
always
neglected
to
do
so
just
now
he
remembered
picking
up
the
empty
one
and
shaking
it
over
the
potatoes
futilely
and
then
changing
it
for
the
full
one
but
he
did
not
take
it
away
in
the
wilderness
one
learns
to
save
useless
things
in
the
faint
hope
that
some
day
they
may
become
useful
the
shelves
were
cluttered
with
fit
companions
to
that
empty
pepper
can
brit
thought
that
he
would
have
cleaned
out
had
he
known
that
lorraine
was
coming
since
she
was
here
it
scarcely
seemed
worth
while
he
walked
on
his
to
the
door
of
the
second
room
of
the
cabin
listened
there
for
a
minute
heard
no
sound
and
took
a
tablet
and
pencil
off
another
shelf
littered
with
useless
things
the
note
which
he
wrote
painstakingly
lest
she
might
think
him
lacking
in
education
he
laid
upon
the
table
beside
lorraine
plate
then
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
as
quietly
as
a
squeaking
door
can
be
made
to
close
lorraine
in
the
other
room
heard
the
squeak
and
sat
up
her
wrist
watch
on
the
chair
beside
her
bed
said
that
it
was
fifteen
minutes
past
six
which
she
considered
an
unearthly
hour
for
rising
she
pulled
up
the
covers
and
tried
to
sleep
again
the
day
would
be
long
enough
at
best
there
was
nothing
to
do
unless
she
took
that
queer
old
horse
with
withers
like
the
breastbone
of
a
lean
christmas
turkey
and
hips
that
reminded
her
of
the
little
roofs
over
dormer
windows
and
went
for
a
ride
and
if
she
did
that
there
was
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
when
she
arrived
there
in
a
very
few
days
lorraine
had
exhausted
the
sights
of
quirt
creek
and
vicinity
if
she
rode
south
she
would
eventually
come
to
the
top
of
a
hill
whence
she
could
look
down
upon
further
stretches
of
barrenness
if
she
rode
east
she
would
come
eventually
to
the
road
along
which
she
had
walked
from
echo
idaho
lorraine
had
had
enough
of
that
road
if
she
went
north
she
would
well
she
would
not
meet
lone
morgan
again
for
she
had
tried
it
twice
and
had
turned
back
because
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
trail
twisting
through
the
sage
and
rocks
west
she
had
not
gone
but
she
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
the
same
dreary
monotony
of
dull
gray
landscape
monotony
of
landscape
was
one
thing
which
lorraine
could
not
endure
unless
it
had
a
foreground
of
riders
hurtling
here
and
there
and
of
perspiring
men
around
a
camera
tripod
at
the
sawtooth
ranch
after
she
was
able
to
be
up
she
had
seen
cowboys
but
they
had
lacked
the
dash
and
the
picturesque
costuming
of
the
west
she
knew
they
were
mostly
commonplace
young
men
jogging
past
the
house
on
horseback
or
loitering
down
by
the
corrals
they
had
offered
absolutely
no
interest
or
color
to
the
place
and
the
owner
son
bob
warfield
had
driven
her
over
to
the
quirt
in
a
ford
and
had
seemed
exactly
like
any
other
big
young
man
who
thought
well
of
himself
lorraine
was
not
susceptible
to
mere
good
looks
three
years
with
the
movies
having
disillusioned
her
quite
thoroughly
too
many
young
men
of
bob
general
type
had
attempted
to
make
love
to
her
lightly
and
not
too
well
for
lorraine
to
be
greatly
impressed
she
yawned
looked
at
her
watch
again
found
that
she
had
spent
exactly
six
minutes
in
meditating
upon
her
immediate
surroundings
and
fell
to
wondering
why
it
was
that
the
real
west
was
so
terribly
commonplace
why
yesterday
she
had
been
brought
to
such
a
pass
of
sheer
loneliness
that
she
had
actually
been
driven
to
reading
an
old
book
she
had
learned
the
symptoms
of
epizoötic
whatever
that
was
and
and
stringhalt
and
had
gone
from
that
to
making
a
shopping
tour
through
a
montgomery
ward
catalogue
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
house
to
read
except
a
half
dozen
old
copies
of
the
there
was
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
see
no
one
to
talk
to
her
dad
and
the
big
man
whom
he
called
frank
seemed
uncomfortably
aware
of
their
deficiencies
and
were
pitiably
anxious
to
make
her
feel
welcome
and
failed
they
called
her
raine
the
other
two
men
did
not
call
her
anything
at
all
they
were
both
and
they
both
chewed
tobacco
quite
noticeably
and
when
they
sat
down
in
their
shirt
sleeves
to
eat
lorraine
had
seen
irregular
humps
in
their
hip
pockets
which
must
be
though
why
they
should
carry
them
in
their
pockets
instead
of
in
holster
belts
buckled
properly
around
their
bodies
and
sagging
savagely
down
at
one
side
and
swinging
ferociously
when
they
walked
lorraine
could
not
imagine
they
did
not
wear
chaps
either
and
their
spurs
were
just
spurs
without
so
much
as
a
silver
concho
anywhere
cowboys
in
overalls
and
blue
gingham
shirts
and
faded
old
coats
whose
lapels
lay
in
wrinkles
and
whose
pockets
were
torn
down
at
the
corners
if
lorraine
had
not
been
positive
that
this
was
actually
a
cattle
ranch
in
idaho
she
never
would
have
believed
that
they
were
anything
but
day
laborers
it
a
comedy
part
for
the
daughter
she
admitted
putting
out
a
hand
to
stroke
the
lean
gray
cat
that
jumped
upon
her
bed
from
the
open
window
ket
it
a
i
take
my
west
before
the
camera
thank
you
or
i
would
if
i
had
jumped
right
into
the
middle
of
this
trick
west
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
ket
what
do
you
do
to
pass
away
the
time
i
do
see
how
you
can
have
the
nerve
to
live
in
an
empty
space
like
this
and
purr
she
got
up
then
looked
into
the
kitchen
and
saw
the
paper
on
the
table
this
was
new
and
vaguely
promised
some
sort
of
break
in
the
deadly
monotony
which
she
saw
stretching
endlessly
before
her
carrying
the
nameless
cat
in
her
arms
lorraine
went
in
her
bare
feet
across
the
grimy
bare
floor
to
the
table
and
picked
up
the
note
it
read
simply
your
brekfast
is
in
the
oven
we
wont
be
back
till
dark
maby
leave
the
ranch
today
yr
loveing
father
lorraine
hugged
the
cat
so
violently
that
she
choked
off
a
purr
in
the
middle
leave
the
ranch
ket
i
believe
it
going
to
be
dangerous
or
something
after
all
she
dressed
quickly
and
went
outside
into
the
sunlight
the
cat
at
her
heels
the
thrill
of
that
one
command
filling
the
gray
monotone
of
the
hills
with
wonderful
possibilities
of
adventure
her
father
had
made
no
objection
before
when
she
went
for
a
ride
he
had
merely
instructed
her
to
keep
to
the
trails
and
if
she
did
know
the
way
home
to
let
the
reins
lie
loose
on
yellowjacket
neck
and
he
would
bring
her
to
the
gate
yellowjacket
instinct
for
direction
had
not
been
working
that
day
however
lorraine
had
no
sooner
left
the
ranch
out
of
sight
behind
her
than
she
pretended
that
she
was
lost
yellowjacket
had
thereupon
walked
a
few
rods
farther
and
stopped
patiently
indifferent
to
the
location
of
his
oats
box
lorraine
had
waited
until
his
head
began
to
droop
lower
and
lower
and
his
switching
at
flies
had
become
purely
automatic
yellowjacket
was
going
to
sleep
without
making
any
effort
to
find
the
way
home
but
since
lorraine
had
not
told
her
father
anything
about
it
his
injunction
could
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
unreliability
of
the
horse
now
she
said
to
the
cat
if
three
or
four
bandits
would
appear
on
the
ridge
over
there
and
come
tearing
down
into
the
immediate
foreground
jump
the
gate
and
surround
the
house
i
know
this
was
the
real
thing
they
want
to
make
me
tell
where
dad
kept
his
gold
or
whatever
it
was
they
wanted
and
they
have
me
tied
to
a
chair
and
then
cut
to
lone
morgan
that
a
perfectly
name
for
the
lead
hearing
shots
and
coming
on
a
dead
run
to
the
rescue
she
picked
up
the
cat
and
walked
slowly
down
the
path
to
the
stable
but
there
are
any
bandits
and
dad
has
any
gold
or
anything
else
worth
stealing
ket
if
dad
is
a
miser
he
and
lone
morgan
is
merely
ashamed
of
the
way
i
talked
to
him
and
afraid
i
queer
myself
with
the
neighbors
no
western
lead
that
ever
saw
would
act
like
that
why
he
did
even
want
to
ride
home
with
me
that
day
and
bob
warfield
and
his
ford
are
incidents
of
the
past
and
not
one
soul
at
the
sawtooth
seems
to
give
a
darn
whether
i
in
the
country
or
out
of
it
soon
as
they
found
out
where
i
belonged
they
brought
me
over
here
and
dropped
me
and
forgot
all
about
me
and
that
i
suppose
is
what
they
call
in
fiction
the
western
spirit
dad
looked
exactly
as
if
he
opened
the
door
to
a
book
agent
when
i
came
he
he
my
presence
ket
and
frank
johnson
pipe
smells
to
high
heaven
and
i
hate
him
in
the
house
and
boys
hmhm
the
ket
it
would
be
terribly
funny
if
i
did
have
to
stay
here
she
had
reached
the
corral
and
stood
balancing
the
cat
on
a
warped
top
rail
staring
disconsolately
at
yellowjacket
who
stood
in
a
far
corner
switching
at
flies
and
shamelessly
displaying
all
the
angularity
of
his
bones
under
a
yellowish
hide
with
roughened
hair
that
was
shedding
dreadfully
as
lorraine
had
discovered
to
her
dismay
when
she
removed
her
green
corduroy
skirt
after
riding
him
yellowjacket
lower
lip
sagged
with
senility
or
lack
of
spirit
lorraine
could
not
tell
which
you
look
like
the
frontispiece
in
that
book
she
remarked
eyeing
him
with
disfavor
i
ca
say
that
comedy
hide
got
improves
your
appearance
you
be
better
peeled
i
believe
she
heard
a
chuckle
behind
her
and
turned
quickly
palm
up
to
shield
her
eyes
from
the
straight
bright
rays
of
the
sun
now
here
was
a
live
man
after
all
with
his
hat
tilted
down
over
his
forehead
a
cigarette
in
one
hand
and
his
reins
in
the
other
looking
at
her
and
smiling
why
do
you
peel
him
just
on
a
chance
his
smile
broadened
to
a
grin
but
when
lorraine
continued
to
look
at
him
with
a
neutral
expression
in
her
eyes
he
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
abandoned
with
it
his
manner
you
miss
hunter
are
you
i
rode
over
to
see
your
father
thought
i
find
him
somewhere
around
the
corral
maybe
you
wo
because
he
gone
for
the
day
no
i
do
know
where
i
see
is
johnson
anywhere
about
no
i
do
believe
any
one
is
anywhere
about
they
were
all
gone
when
i
got
up
a
little
while
ago
then
remembering
that
she
did
not
know
this
man
and
that
she
was
a
long
way
from
neighbors
she
added
if
you
leave
a
message
i
can
tell
dad
when
he
comes
home
i
ride
over
or
next
day
i
the
man
at
whisper
you
can
tell
him
i
called
and
that
i
call
again
still
he
did
not
go
and
lorraine
waited
some
instinct
warned
her
that
the
man
had
not
yet
stated
his
real
reason
for
coming
and
she
wondered
a
little
what
it
could
be
he
seemed
to
be
watching
her
covertly
yet
she
failed
to
catch
any
telltale
admiration
for
her
in
his
scrutiny
she
decided
that
his
forehead
was
too
narrow
to
please
her
and
that
his
eyes
were
too
close
together
and
that
the
lines
around
his
mouth
were
cruel
lines
and
gave
the
lie
to
his
smile
which
was
pleasant
enough
if
you
just
looked
at
the
smile
and
paid
no
attention
to
anything
else
in
his
face
you
had
quite
an
experience
getting
out
here
they
tell
me
he
observed
carelessly
too
carelessly
thought
lorraine
who
was
well
schooled
in
the
circumlocutions
of
delinquent
tenants
agents
of
various
sorts
and
those
who
crave
small
gossip
of
their
neighbors
heard
you
were
lost
up
in
rock
city
all
night
lorraine
looked
up
at
him
startled
i
caught
a
terrible
cold
she
said
laughing
nervously
i
not
used
to
the
climate
she
added
guardedly
the
man
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
produced
smoking
material
do
you
mind
if
i
smoke
he
asked
perfunctorily
why
no
it
does
concern
me
in
the
slightest
degree
why
she
thought
confusedly
must
she
be
reminded
of
that
horrible
place
of
rocks
what
was
it
to
this
man
where
she
had
been
lost
you
must
of
got
there
about
the
time
the
storm
broke
the
man
hazarded
after
a
silence
it
sure
a
bad
place
in
a
thunderstorm
them
rocks
draw
lightning
pretty
bad
was
it
lightning
is
always
bad
is
it
lorraine
tried
to
hold
her
voice
steady
i
do
know
much
about
it
we
do
have
thunderstorms
to
amount
to
anything
in
los
angeles
it
sometimes
does
thunder
there
in
the
winter
but
it
is
very
mild
with
hands
that
trembled
she
picked
the
cat
off
the
rail
and
started
toward
the
house
i
tell
dad
what
you
said
she
told
him
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
when
she
saw
that
he
had
turned
his
horse
and
was
frankly
following
her
to
the
house
her
heart
jumped
wildly
into
her
throat
judging
by
the
feel
of
it
i
plumb
out
of
matches
i
wonder
if
you
can
let
me
have
some
he
said
still
speaking
too
carelessly
to
reassure
her
so
you
stuck
it
out
in
rock
city
all
through
that
storm
that
more
than
what
i
want
to
do
she
did
not
answer
that
but
once
on
the
doorstep
lorraine
turned
and
faced
him
quite
suddenly
it
came
to
her
the
knowledge
of
why
she
did
not
like
this
man
she
stared
at
him
her
eyes
wide
and
bright
your
hat
brown
she
exclaimed
unguardedly
i
i
saw
a
man
with
a
brown
hat
he
laughed
suddenly
if
you
stay
around
here
long
you
see
a
good
many
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
and
turning
it
on
his
hand
before
her
this
here
hat
i
traded
for
yesterday
i
had
a
gray
one
but
it
did
suit
me
too
narrow
in
the
brim
brown
hats
are
getting
to
be
the
style
if
i
can
borrow
half
a
dozen
matches
miss
hunter
i
be
going
lorraine
looked
at
him
again
doubtfully
and
went
after
the
matches
he
thanked
her
smiling
down
at
her
quizzically
a
man
can
get
along
without
lots
of
things
but
he
plumb
lost
without
matches
maybe
saved
my
life
miss
hunter
if
you
only
knew
it
she
watched
him
as
he
rode
away
opening
the
gate
and
letting
himself
through
without
dismounting
he
disappeared
finally
around
a
small
spur
of
the
hill
and
lorraine
found
her
knees
trembling
under
her
ket
you
an
awful
fool
she
exclaimed
fiercely
why
did
you
let
me
give
myself
away
to
that
man
i
i
believe
he
the
man
and
if
i
really
did
see
him
it
was
my
imagination
at
all
he
saw
me
there
perhaps
ket
i
scared
i
not
going
to
stay
on
this
ranch
all
alone
i
going
to
saddle
the
family
skeleton
and
i
going
to
ride
till
dark
there
something
queer
about
that
man
from
whisper
i
afraid
of
him
after
awhile
when
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
and
was
putting
up
a
lunch
lorraine
picked
up
the
nameless
gray
cat
and
holding
its
head
between
her
slim
fingers
looked
at
it
steadily
ket
you
the
humanest
thing
i
seen
since
i
left
home
she
said
wistfully
i
a
country
where
horrible
things
happen
under
the
surface
and
the
top
is
just
gray
and
quiet
and
so
dull
it
makes
you
want
to
scream
lone
morgan
lied
to
me
he
lied
he
lied
she
hugged
the
cat
impulsively
and
rubbed
her
cheek
absently
against
it
so
that
it
began
purring
immediately
ket
i
afraid
of
that
man
at
whisper
she
breathed
miserably
against
its
fur
chapter
eight
it
takes
nerve
just
to
hang
on
brit
was
smoking
his
pipe
after
supper
and
staring
at
nothing
though
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
closed
door
lorraine
had
washed
the
dishes
and
was
tidying
the
room
and
looking
at
her
father
now
and
then
in
a
troubled
questioning
way
of
which
brit
was
quite
oblivious
dad
she
said
abruptly
who
is
the
man
at
whisper
brit
turned
his
eyes
slowly
to
her
face
as
if
he
had
not
grasped
her
meaning
and
was
waiting
for
her
to
repeat
the
question
it
was
evident
that
his
thoughts
had
pulled
away
from
something
that
meant
a
good
deal
to
him
why
a
man
came
this
morning
and
said
he
was
the
man
at
whisper
and
that
he
would
come
again
to
see
you
brit
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
looked
at
it
and
crowded
down
the
tobacco
with
a
forefinger
he
seen
me
ride
away
from
the
ranch
this
morning
he
said
he
was
coming
down
the
whisper
trail
as
i
was
taking
the
fork
over
to
sugar
spring
frank
and
me
what
did
he
say
he
wanted
to
see
me
about
he
did
say
he
asked
for
you
and
frank
lorraine
sat
down
and
folded
her
arms
on
the
table
dad
what
whisper
whisper
a
camp
up
against
a
cliff
over
west
of
here
it
belongs
to
the
sawtooth
is
that
all
he
said
just
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
he
talked
a
little
lorraine
admitted
her
eyebrows
pulled
down
if
he
saw
you
leave
i
should
think
he
come
here
and
ask
for
you
he
knowed
i
was
gone
brit
stated
briefly
with
a
finger
nail
lorraine
traced
the
ugly
brown
pattern
on
the
oilcloth
it
was
not
easy
to
talk
to
this
silent
man
who
was
her
father
but
she
had
done
a
great
deal
of
thinking
during
that
long
empty
day
and
she
had
reached
the
point
where
she
was
afraid
not
to
speak
dad
what
do
you
want
raine
dad
was
has
any
one
around
here
died
lately
died
nobody
but
fred
thurman
over
here
on
granite
he
was
drug
with
a
horse
and
killed
lorraine
caught
her
breath
saw
brit
looking
at
her
curiously
and
moved
closer
to
him
she
wanted
to
be
near
somebody
just
then
and
after
all
brit
was
her
father
and
his
silence
was
not
the
inertia
of
a
dull
mind
she
knew
he
seemed
somehow
and
bitter
she
caught
his
hand
and
held
it
feeling
its
roughness
between
her
two
soft
palms
dad
i
got
to
tell
you
i
feel
trapped
somehow
did
his
horse
have
a
white
face
dad
yes
he
a
roan
why
brit
moved
uncomfortably
but
he
did
not
take
his
hand
away
from
her
what
do
you
know
about
it
raine
i
saw
a
man
shoot
fred
thurman
and
push
his
foot
through
the
stirrup
and
dad
i
believe
it
was
that
man
at
whisper
the
one
i
saw
had
on
a
brown
hat
and
this
man
wears
a
brown
hat
and
i
was
advised
not
to
tell
any
one
i
had
been
at
that
place
they
call
rock
city
when
the
storm
came
dad
would
an
innocent
man
one
that
did
have
anything
to
do
with
a
crime
would
he
try
to
cover
it
up
afterwards
brit
hand
shook
when
he
removed
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
laid
it
on
the
table
his
face
had
turned
gray
while
lorraine
watched
him
fearfully
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
pressing
down
hard
and
at
last
his
eyes
met
her
big
searching
ones
if
he
wanted
to
in
this
country
he
have
to
leastways
have
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
he
said
grimly
and
he
try
to
shut
the
mouths
of
others
if
he
cared
anything
about
them
he
would
you
ai
told
anybody
what
you
saw
have
yuh
lorraine
hid
her
face
against
his
arm
just
lone
morgan
and
he
thought
i
was
crazy
and
imagined
it
that
was
in
the
morning
when
he
found
me
and
he
he
wanted
me
to
go
on
thinking
it
was
just
a
nightmare
that
imagined
the
whole
thing
and
i
did
for
awhile
but
this
man
at
whisper
tried
to
find
out
where
i
was
that
night
brit
pulled
abruptly
away
from
her
got
up
and
opened
the
door
he
stood
there
for
a
time
looking
out
into
the
gloom
of
early
nightfall
he
seemed
to
be
listening
lorraine
thought
when
he
came
back
to
her
his
voice
was
lower
his
manner
intangibly
furtive
you
did
tell
him
anything
did
you
he
asked
as
if
there
had
been
no
pause
in
their
talk
no
i
made
him
believe
i
was
there
or
i
tried
to
and
dad
as
i
was
going
to
cross
that
creek
just
before
you
come
to
rock
city
two
men
came
along
on
horseback
and
i
hid
before
they
saw
me
they
stopped
to
water
their
horses
and
they
were
talking
they
said
something
about
the
tj
had
been
here
a
long
time
but
they
would
get
theirs
and
it
was
like
sitting
into
a
poker
game
with
a
nickel
they
said
the
little
ones
are
big
enough
to
fight
the
sawtooth
and
they
carry
lead
under
their
hides
if
they
did
leave
dad
is
your
brand
the
tj
what
it
looks
like
on
yellowjacket
brit
did
not
answer
and
when
lorraine
was
sure
that
he
did
not
mean
to
do
so
she
asked
another
question
dad
why
did
you
want
me
to
leave
the
ranch
i
was
nervous
after
that
man
was
here
and
i
did
go
i
did
want
you
riding
around
the
country
unless
i
knew
where
you
went
brit
said
my
brand
is
the
tj
we
never
call
it
just
the
tj
oh
said
lorraine
relieved
they
were
talking
about
you
then
but
dad
it
horrible
we
simply
let
that
murder
go
and
not
do
anything
because
i
know
that
man
was
shot
i
heard
the
shot
fired
and
i
saw
him
start
to
fall
off
his
horse
and
the
next
flash
of
lightning
i
saw
look
here
raine
i
do
want
you
talking
about
what
you
saw
i
want
you
about
it
what
the
use
thurman
dead
and
buried
the
come
and
held
an
inquest
and
the
jury
agreed
it
was
an
accident
i
was
on
the
jury
the
sheriff
took
charge
of
his
property
you
could
prove
what
you
saw
even
if
you
was
to
try
he
looked
at
her
very
much
as
lone
morgan
had
looked
at
her
his
next
words
were
very
nearly
what
lone
morgan
had
said
lorraine
remembered
you
do
know
this
country
like
i
know
it
folks
live
in
it
mainly
because
they
go
around
blatting
everything
they
see
and
hear
and
think
you
have
laws
do
you
dad
you
spoke
about
the
sheriff
the
sheriff
brit
laughed
harshly
yes
we
got
a
sheriff
and
we
got
a
jail
and
a
judge
all
the
makin
of
law
but
we
ai
got
one
thing
that
goes
with
it
and
that
justice
you
best
make
up
your
mind
like
the
jury
done
that
fred
thurman
was
drug
to
death
by
his
horse
that
all
that
ever
be
proved
and
if
you
ca
prove
nothing
else
you
better
keep
your
mouth
shut
lorraine
sprang
up
and
stood
facing
her
father
every
nerve
taut
with
protest
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
dad
that
you
and
frank
johnson
and
lone
morgan
and
everybody
in
the
country
are
do
you
brit
looked
at
her
patiently
no
he
said
in
the
tone
of
acknowledged
defeat
we
ai
cowards
raine
a
man
ai
a
coward
when
he
stands
with
his
hands
over
his
head
most
generally
it
because
some
one
got
the
drop
on
lorraine
would
not
accept
that
you
think
so
because
you
do
fight
she
cried
hotly
no
one
is
holding
a
gun
at
your
head
dad
i
thought
westerners
never
quit
it
fight
to
the
finish
always
why
i
seen
one
man
fight
a
whole
outfit
and
win
he
could
be
beaten
because
he
would
give
up
why
brit
gave
her
a
tolerant
glance
where
you
see
all
that
raine
he
moved
to
the
table
picked
up
his
pipe
and
knocked
out
the
ashes
on
the
stove
hearth
his
movements
were
those
of
an
aging
man
yet
brit
hunter
was
not
old
as
age
is
reckoned
well
in
stories
but
it
was
reasonable
and
logical
and
possible
just
the
same
if
you
use
your
brains
you
can
outwit
them
and
if
you
have
any
nerve
brit
made
a
sound
somewhat
like
a
snort
these
days
when
politics
is
played
by
the
big
fellows
and
the
law
is
used
to
make
money
for
it
takes
nerve
just
to
hang
on
he
said
nobody
but
a
dang
fool
would
fight
slow
anger
grew
within
him
he
turned
upon
lorraine
almost
fiercely
think
me
and
frank
could
fight
the
sawtooth
and
get
anything
out
of
it
but
a
coffin
apiece
maybe
he
demanded
harshly
do
the
sawtooth
this
country
warfield
got
the
sheriff
in
his
pocket
and
the
and
the
judge
and
the
stock
inspector
he
warfield
and
what
he
wants
he
gets
he
gets
it
through
the
law
that
you
was
talking
about
a
little
while
ago
what
you
goin
to
do
about
it
if
i
had
the
money
and
the
land
and
the
political
pull
he
got
mebby
i
have
me
a
sheriff
and
a
judge
too
fred
thurman
tried
to
fight
the
sawtooth
over
a
water
right
he
owned
and
they
wanted
they
had
the
case
runnin
in
court
till
they
like
to
of
took
the
last
dollar
he
had
he
got
that
water
right
meant
the
hull
ranch
everything
he
owned
you
ca
run
a
ranch
without
water
and
when
he
took
the
case
up
and
up
till
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
and
he
stood
some
show
of
winnin
out
he
had
an
accident
he
was
drug
to
death
by
his
horse
brit
stooped
and
opened
the
stove
door
seeking
a
live
coal
found
none
and
turned
again
to
lorraine
shaking
his
pipe
at
her
for
emphasis
we
try
to
prove
fred
was
murdered
and
what
the
result
something
happens
to
me
mebby
or
frank
or
both
of
us
and
you
ca
say
i
know
the
sawtooth
had
a
hand
in
that
you
got
to
it
and
when
you
proved
it
he
added
bitterly
you
got
to
have
officers
that
carry
out
the
law
instead
of
using
it
to
yuh
his
futile
dull
anger
surged
up
again
you
call
us
cowards
because
we
do
git
up
on
our
hind
legs
and
fight
the
sawtooth
a
lot
know
about
courage
you
read
stories
and
you
saw
moving
pictures
and
you
think
that
the
west
that
the
way
they
do
it
one
man
hold
off
a
hunderd
with
his
gun
and
on
the
other
hand
a
hunderd
men
mebby
ridin
after
one
you
think
that
it
that
the
way
they
do
it
hunh
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
stove
spat
into
it
as
if
he
were
spitting
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
and
turned
again
to
lorraine
what
you
seen
what
you
say
you
seen
that
was
done
at
night
when
there
was
no
audience
all
the
fighting
the
sawtooth
does
is
done
under
cover
wo
see
none
of
it
they
ai
such
fools
and
what

hand
so
fur
his
mind
returned
to
the
grisly
thing
lorraine
had
seen
we
ca
run
down
the
man
that
got
fred
thurman
supposin
he
was
killed
as
you
say
that
what
the
law
is
paid
to
do
if
lone
morgan
told
you
not
to
talk
about
it
he
told
you
right
he
was
talking
for
your
own
good
what
about
al
the
man
from
whisper
you
did
tell
did
you
his
tone
the
suppressed
violence
of
his
manner
frightened
lorraine
she
moved
farther
away
from
him
i
did
tell
him
anything
he
was
curious
but
i
only
said
i
knew
him
because
he
was
wearing
a
brown
hat
and
the
man
that
shot
thurman
had
a
brown
hat
i
did
say
all
that
i
just
mentioned
the
hat
and
he
said
there
were
lots
of
brown
hats
in
the
country
he
said
he
had
traded
for
that
one
just
yesterday
he
said
his
own
hat
was
gray
brit
stared
at
her
his
jaw
sagging
a
little
his
eyes
growing
vacant
with
the
thoughts
he
hid
deep
in
his
mind
he
slumped
down
into
his
chair
and
leaned
forward
his
arms
resting
on
his
knees
his
fingers
clasped
loosely
after
a
little
he
tilted
his
head
and
looked
up
at
her
you
better
go
to
bed
he
told
her
stolidly
and
if
you
going
to
live
at
the
quirt
raine
you
have
to
learn
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
i
ai
blaming
you
but
you
told
too
much
to
al
woodruff
do
talk
to
him
no
more
if
he
comes
here
when
i
gone
he
put
out
a
hand
beckoning
her
to
him
sorry
for
his
harshness
lorraine
went
to
him
and
knelt
beside
him
slipping
an
arm
around
his
neck
while
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
i
wo
be
a
nuisance
dad
really
i
wo
she
said
i
i
can
shoot
a
gun
i
never
shot
one
with
bullets
in
but
i
could
and
i
learned
to
do
lots
of
things
when
i
was
working
in
that
play
west
i
thought
was
real
it
is
like
i
thought
there
no
picture
stuff
in
the
real
west
i
guess
they
do
do
things
that
way
but
what
i
want
you
to
know
is
that
if
they
fighting
you
they
have
to
fight
me
too
i
do
mean
movie
stuff
honestly
i
do
i
in
this
thing
now
and
you
have
to
count
me
same
as
you
count
jim
and
sorry
wo
you
please
feel
that
i
one
more
in
the
game
dad
and
not
just
another
responsibility
i
herd
cattle
or
do
whatever
there
is
to
do
and
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
too
i
ca
stay
here
day
after
day
doing
nothing
but
sweep
and
dust
two
rooms
and
fry
potatoes
and
bacon
for
you
at
night
dad
i
go
if
you
do
let
me
into
your
life
dad
if
you
knew
the
stunts
i
done
in
the
last
three
years
it
was
west
but
i
learned
things
just
the
same
she
kissed
him
on
the
unshaven
cheek
nearest
her
and
thought
of
the
kisses
she
had
breathed
upon
the
cheeks
of
story
fathers
with
due
care
for
the
on
her
lips
just
because
this
was
real
she
kissed
him
again
with
the
frank
vigor
of
a
child
dad
she
said
wheedlingly
i
think
you
might
scare
up
something
that
i
can
really
ride
yellowjacket
is
safe
but
but
you
have
real
horses
on
the
ranch
have
you
you
must
go
judging
me
by
the
palms
and
the
bay
windows
of
the
casa
grande
that
where
i
slept
the
last
few
years
when
i
was
off
on
location
but
it
just
as
sensible
to
think
i
do
know
anything
else
as
it
would
be
for
me
to
think
you
ca
do
anything
but
skim
milk
and
fry
bacon
and
make
bread
just
because
i
seen
you
do
it
brit
laughed
and
patted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
if
you
was
a
boy
i
set
you
up
as
a
lawyer
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
playfulness
i
kinda
thought
you
could
ride
i
seen
how
you
piled
onto
old
yellowjacket
and
the
way
you
held
your
reins
it
runs
in
the
blood
i
guess
i
see
what
i
can
do
in
the
way
of
a
horse
ole
yellowjacket
used
to
be
a
real
but
he
gitting
old
gitting
old
same
as
me
you
not
you
just
letting
yourself
old
and
am
i
one
of
the
outfit
dad
i
guess
so
only
there
ai
going
to
be
any
of
this
stuff
raine
you
ca
travel
these
trails
at
a
long
lope
with
yore
hair
flyin
out
behind
and
and
all
that
damn
foolishness
i
saw
in
the
movin
pitchers
lorraine
blushed
and
was
thankful
that
her
dad
had
not
watched
her
work
in
that
serial
for
that
matter
she
hoped
that
lone
morgan
would
never
stray
into
a
movie
where
any
of
her
pictures
were
being
shown
i
serious
dad
i
do
want
to
make
a
show
of
myself
but
if
feel
that
i
can
be
a
help
instead
of
a
handicap
that
what
i
want
and
if
it
comes
to
fighting
brit
pushed
her
from
him
impatiently
there
yuh
go
fight
fight
and
i
told
yuh
there
ai
any
fighting
going
on
nothing
a
fight
to
hang
on
and
make
a
living
that
means
straight
hard
work
and
your
own
business
if
you
want
to
help
at
that
i
do
said
raine
quietly
getting
to
her
feet
her
legacy
of
stubbornness
set
her
lips
firmly
together
that
exactly
what
i
mean
good
night
dad
brit
answered
her
noncommittally
apparently
sunk
already
in
his
own
musings
but
his
lips
drew
in
to
suppress
a
smile
when
he
saw
from
the
corner
of
his
eyes
that
lorraine
was
winding
the
alarm
on
the
cheap
kitchen
clock
and
that
she
set
the
hand
carefully
and
took
the
clock
with
her
to
bed
chapter
nine
the
evil
eye
of
the
sawtooth
oppression
is
a
growth
that
flourishes
best
in
the
soil
of
opportunity
it
seldom
springs
into
full
power
at
once
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
had
begun
much
as
its
neighbors
had
begun
with
a
tract
of
land
cattle
and
the
ambition
for
prospering
senator
warfield
had
then
been
plain
bill
warfield
manager
of
the
outfit
who
rode
with
his
men
and
saw
how
his
herds
increased
saw
too
how
they
might
increase
faster
under
certain
conditions
at
the
outset
he
was
not
perhaps
more
unscrupulous
than
some
of
his
neighbors
true
if
a
homesteader
left
his
claim
for
a
longer
time
than
the
law
allowed
him
bill
warfield
would
choose
one
of
his
own
men
to
file
a
contest
on
that
claim
the
man
wages
would
be
paid
witnesses
were
never
lacking
to
swear
to
the
improvements
he
had
made
and
after
the
patent
had
been
granted
the
homesteader
for
the
contestant
always
won
in
that
country
the
sawtooth
would
pay
him
for
the
land
frequently
a
sawtooth
man
would
file
upon
land
before
any
other
man
had
claimed
it
sometimes
a
sawtooth
man
would
purchase
a
relinquishment
from
some
poor
devil
of
a
who
seemed
always
to
have
bad
luck
and
so
became
discouraged
and
ready
to
sell
an
intelligent
man
like
bill
warfield
could
acquire
much
land
in
this
manner
give
him
time
enough
in
much
the
same
manner
his
herds
increased
he
bought
out
small
ranchers
who
were
crowded
to
the
selling
point
in
one
way
or
another
they
would
find
themselves
fenced
off
from
water
the
sawtooth
having
acquired
the
water
rights
to
creek
or
spring
or
they
would
be
hemmed
in
with
fenced
fields
and
would
find
it
next
to
impossible
to
make
use
of
the
law
which
gave
them
the
right
to
condemn
a
road
through
they
would
not
be
openly
assailed
bill
warfield
was
an
intelligent
man
a
dozen
brands
were
recorded
in
the
name
of
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
and
if
a
small
rancher
found
his
calf
crop
shorter
than
it
should
be
he
might
think
as
he
pleased
but
he
would
have
no
tangible
proof
that
his
calves
wore
a
sawtooth
brand
inevitably
it
became
necessary
now
and
then
to
stop
a
mouth
that
was
ready
to
speak
unwelcome
truths
but
if
a
sawtooth
man
were
known
to
have
committed
violence
the
sawtooth
itself
was
the
first
to
put
the
sheriff
on
his
trail
if
the
man
successfully
dodged
the
sheriff
and
made
his
way
to
parts
unknown
the
sawtooth
could
shrug
its
shoulders
and
wash
its
hands
of
him
then
whispers
were
heard
that
the
sawtooth
had
on
its
pay
roll
men
who
were
paid
to
kill
and
to
leave
no
trace
so
many
heedless
ones
crossed
the
sawtooth
path
to
riches
fred
thurman
had
been
one
a
cuss
who
had
the
temerity
to
fight
back
when
the
sawtooth
calmly
laid
claim
to
the
first
water
rights
to
granite
creek
having
bought
it
they
said
with
the
placer
claim
of
an
old
miner
who
had
prospected
along
the
headwaters
of
granite
at
the
base
of
bear
top
by
that
time
the
sawtooth
had
grown
to
a
power
no
poor
man
could
hope
to
defeat
bill
warfield
was
senator
warfield
and
senator
warfield
was
a
power
in
the
political
world
that
immediately
surrounded
him
since
his
neighboring
ranchmen
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
his
steady
climbing
to
the
position
he
now
held
they
had
small
hope
of
pulling
him
down
brit
was
right
they
did
well
to
hang
on
and
continue
living
in
that
country
an
open
killing
one
that
would
attract
the
attention
of
the
outside
world
might
be
avenged
the
man
who
committed
the
crime
might
be
punished
if
public
opinion
were
sufficiently
massed
against
him
in
that
case
senator
warfield
would
cry
loudest
for
justice
but
it
would
take
a
stronger
man
than
the
country
held
to
raise
the
question
of
fred
thurman
death
and
take
even
the
first
steps
toward
proving
it
a
murder
it
ai
that
they
can
anything
warfield
the
man
from
whisper
said
guardedly
urging
his
horse
close
to
the
machine
that
stood
in
the
trail
from
echo
it
was
broad
day
a
day
to
boot
and
senator
warfield
perspired
behind
the
wheel
of
his
car
the
talk
they
may
get
started
what
have
they
said
the
girl
was
at
the
ranch
for
several
days
she
did
talk
there
or
hawkins
would
have
told
me
she
was
sick
i
saw
her
the
other
day
at
the
quirt
and
she
half
recognized
me
hell
how
know
she
was
in
there
among
them
rocks
everybody
that
was
apt
to
be
riding
through
was
accounted
for
and
i
knew
there
was
any
one
coming
horseback
or
with
a
rig
my
pretty
good
warfield
moved
the
spark
lever
up
and
down
on
the
wheel
while
he
thought
well
he
said
carefully
at
last
if
you
falling
down
in
your
work
what
are
you
whining
about
it
to
me
for
what
do
you
want
al
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
i
want
to
know
how
far
i
can
go
it
been
hands
off
the
quirt
up
to
now
and
the
quirt
beginning
to
think
it
can
get
away
with
most
anything
they
throwed
a
fence
across
the
pass
through
from
sugar
spring
to
whisper
that
sends
us
away
around
by
three
creek
you
ca
trail
stock
across
granite
ridge
nor
them
lava
ledges
if
it
going
to
be
hands
off
i
want
to
know
it
other
places
i
rather
live
in
if
the
quirt
going
to
raise
talk
about
fred
thurman
senator
warfield
pulled
at
his
collar
and
tie
as
if
they
choked
him
the
quirt
has
made
no
trouble
he
said
of
course
if
they
begin
throwing
fences
across
our
stock
trails
and
peddling
gossip
that
is
another
story
i
expect
you
to
protect
our
interests
of
course
and
i
have
never
made
a
practice
of
dictating
to
you
in
this
case
he
sent
a
sharp
glance
at
al
it
seems
to
me
your
interests
are
involved
more
than
ours
as
to
fred
thurman
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
was
not
here
when
he
died
and
i
have
never
seen
this
girl
of
brit
who
seems
to
worry
you
she
does
interest
me
one
way
or
the
other
she
seems
to
interest
bob
a
whole
lot
al
said
maliciously
he
rode
over
to
see
her
yesterday
she
was
home
though
senator
warfield
seemed
unmoved
by
this
bit
of
news
wherefore
al
returned
to
the
main
issue
do
i
get
a
free
hand
or
do
i
he
insisted
they
ca
be
let
peddle
talk
not
if
i
stay
around
here
senator
warfield
considered
the
matter
the
girl
got
the
only
line
on
me
al
went
on
the
inquest
was
as
clean
as
i
ever
saw
everything
all
straight
and
then
here
she
comes
up
if
you
know
how
to
stop
a
woman
mouth
al
you
can
make
a
million
a
month
telling
other
men
senator
warfield
smiled
at
him
then
he
leaned
across
the
front
seat
and
added
impressively
bear
one
thing
in
mind
al
the
sawtooth
can
not
permit
itself
to
become
involved
in
any
scandal
nor
in
any
killing
cases
we
just
at
the
most
crucial
point
with
our
reclamation
project
over
here
on
the
flat
the
legislature
is
willing
to
make
an
appropriation
for
the
building
of
the
canal
and
in
two
or
three
months
at
the
latest
we
should
begin
selling
agricultural
tracts
to
the
public
the
state
will
also
throw
open
the
land
it
had
withdrawn
from
settlement
pending
the
floating
of
this
canal
project
more
than
ever
the
integrity
of
the
sawtooth
cattle
company
must
be
preserved
since
it
has
come
out
openly
as
a
backer
of
the
irrigation
company
nothing
must
be
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
he
removed
his
thin
driving
cap
and
wiped
his
perspiring
forehead
sorry
this
all
happened
as
it
has
turned
out
he
said
with
real
regret
in
his
tone
but
since
it
did
happen
i
must
rely
upon
you
to
to
er
i
guess
i
understand
al
grinned
sardonically
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
how
things
is
building
up
the
quirt
kinda
overreached
itself
i
did
want
you
comin
back
on
me
for
trying
to
keep
their
feet
outa
the
trough
i
want
you
to
know
things
is
pretty
damn
ticklish
right
now
and
it
going
to
take
careful
steppin
well
do
let
your
foot
slip
al
senator
warfield
warned
him
the
sawtooth
would
hate
to
lose
you
you
a
good
man
oh
i
get
yuh
al
retorted
my
foot
ai
going
to
slip
if
it
did
the
sawtooth
would
be
the
first
to
pile
onto
my
back
the
last
sentence
was
not
meant
for
the
senator
ears
al
had
backed
his
horse
and
senator
warfield
was
stepping
on
the
starter
but
it
would
not
have
mattered
greatly
if
he
had
heard
for
this
was
a
point
quite
thoroughly
understood
by
them
both
the
warfield
car
went
on
lurching
over
the
inequalities
of
the
narrow
road
al
shook
his
horse
into
a
shambling
trot
picking
his
way
carelessly
through
the
scattered
sage
his
horse
traveled
easily
now
and
then
lifting
a
foot
high
to
avoid
rock
or
exposed
root
or
swerving
sharply
around
obstacles
too
high
to
step
over
al
very
seldom
traveled
along
the
beaten
trails
though
there
was
nothing
to
deter
him
now
save
an
inherent
tendency
toward
secretiveness
of
his
motives
destinations
and
whereabouts
if
the
country
was
open
you
would
see
al
woodruff
riding
at
some
distance
from
the
trail
or
you
would
not
see
him
at
all
if
there
were
gullies
in
which
he
could
conceal
himself
he
was
always
or
hunting
stray
stock
horses
usually
or
striking
across
to
some
of
the
sawtooth
on
business
which
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
state
but
you
will
long
ago
have
guessed
that
he
was
the
evil
eye
of
the
sawtooth
company
he
took
no
orders
save
such
general
ones
as
senator
warfield
had
just
given
him
he
gave
none
whatever
he
did
he
did
alone
and
he
took
no
man
into
his
confidence
it
is
more
than
probable
that
senator
warfield
would
never
have
known
to
a
certainty
that
al
was
responsible
for
thurman
death
if
al
had
not
been
worried
over
the
quirt
possible
knowledge
of
the
crime
and
anxious
to
know
just
how
far
his
power
might
go
ostensibly
he
was
in
charge
of
the
camp
at
whisper
a
place
far
enough
off
the
beaten
trails
to
free
him
from
chance
visitors
the
sawtooth
kept
many
such
camps
occupied
by
men
whose
duty
it
was
to
look
after
the
sawtooth
cattle
that
grazed
near
to
see
that
stock
did
not
bog
down
in
the
tricky
sand
of
the
adjacent
water
holes
and
die
before
help
came
and
to
fend
off
any
encroachments
of
the
smaller
cattle
owners
though
these
were
growing
fewer
year
by
year
thanks
to
the
policy
of
the
sawtooth
and
the
cunning
activities
of
such
as
al
woodruff
it
may
sound
strange
to
say
that
the
sawtooth
country
had
not
had
a
real
killing
for
years
though
accidental
deaths
had
been
rather
frequent
one
man
for
instance
had
fallen
over
a
ledge
and
broken
his
neck
presumably
while
drunk
another
had
bought
a
few
sticks
of
dynamite
to
open
up
a
spring
on
his
ranch
and
at
the
inquest
which
followed
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
death
caused
by
being
blown
up
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
dynamite
a
sheepman
was
struck
by
lightning
according
to
the
coroner
and
his
widow
had
been
glad
to
sell
ranch
and
sheep
very
cheaply
to
the
sawtooth
and
return
to
her
relatives
in
montana
the
sawtooth
had
shipped
the
sheep
within
a
month
and
turned
the
ranch
into
another
you
will
see
that
senator
warfield
had
every
reason
to
be
sincere
when
he
called
al
woodruff
a
good
man
good
for
the
sawtooth
interests
that
means
you
will
also
see
that
brit
hunter
had
reasons
for
believing
that
the
business
of
ranching
in
the
sawtooth
country
might
be
classed
as
extra
hazardous
and
for
saying
that
it
took
nerve
just
to
hang
on
that
is
why
al
rode
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
meditating
no
doubt
upon
the
best
means
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
sawtooth
and
at
the
same
time
soothing
effectively
the
ticklishness
of
the
situation
of
which
he
had
complained
it
was
his
business
to
find
the
best
means
it
was
for
just
such
work
that
the
sawtooth
paid
him
secretly
to
be
sure
better
wages
than
the
foreman
hawkins
received
al
was
conscientious
and
did
his
best
to
earn
his
wages
not
because
he
particularly
loved
killing
and
spying
as
a
sport
but
because
the
sawtooth
had
bought
his
loyalty
for
a
price
and
so
long
as
he
felt
that
he
was
getting
a
square
deal
from
them
he
would
turn
his
hand
against
any
man
that
stood
in
their
way
he
was
a
sawtooth
man
and
he
fought
the
enemies
of
the
sawtooth
as
as
a
soldier
will
fight
for
his
country
to
his
unimaginative
mind
there
was
sufficient
justification
in
that
attitude
as
for
the
ease
with
which
he
planned
to
kill
and
cover
his
killing
under
the
semblance
of
accident
he
would
have
said
if
you
could
make
him
speak
of
it
that
he
was
not
squeamish
they
all
have
to
die
some
day
anyway
chapter
ten
another
sawtooth
accident
frank
johnson
rose
from
the
breakfast
table
shaved
a
splinter
off
the
edge
of
the
water
bench
for
a
toothpick
and
sharpened
it
carefully
while
he
looked
at
brit
you
goin
after
them
posts
or
shall
i
he
inquired
glumly
which
by
the
way
was
his
normal
tone
jim
and
sorry
oughta
git
the
post
holes
all
dug
one
of
us
better
take
a
look
through
that
young
stock
in
the
lower
field
too
and
see
if
there
any
more
sign
uh
blackleg
which
you
ruther
do
brit
tilted
his
chair
backward
so
that
he
could
reach
the
coffeepot
on
the
stove
hearth
i
haul
down
the
posts
he
decided
carelessly
they
easy
loaded
and
i
guess
my
back
as
good
as
yourn
all
you
got
to
do
is
skid
down
the
bank
onto
the
wagon
frank
said
i
wisht
you
go
on
up
where
we
cut
them
last
ones
and
git
my
sweater
brit
i
musta
left
it
hanging
on
a
bush
right
close
to
where
i
was
workin
brit
grunt
signified
assent
and
frank
went
out
jim
and
sorry
the
two
unpicturesque
cowboys
of
whom
lorraine
had
complained
to
the
cat
had
already
departed
with
pick
and
shovel
to
their
unromantic
task
of
digging
post
holes
each
carried
a
most
unattractive
lunch
tied
in
a
flour
sack
behind
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
lorraine
had
done
her
conscientious
best
but
with
lumpy
bread
cold
bacon
and
currant
jelly
of
that
kind
which
is
packed
in
wooden
kegs
one
ca
do
much
with
a
cold
lunch
lorraine
wondered
how
much
worse
it
would
look
after
it
had
been
tied
on
the
saddle
for
half
a
day
wondered
too
what
those
two
silent
ones
got
out
of
life
what
they
looked
forward
to
what
was
their
final
goal
for
that
matter
she
frequently
wondered
what
there
was
in
life
for
any
of
them
shut
into
that
deadly
monotony
of
sagebrush
and
rocks
interspersed
with
little
grassy
meadows
where
the
cattle
fed
listlessly
even
the
sinister
undercurrent
of
antagonism
against
the
quirt
could
not
whip
her
emotions
feeling
that
she
was
doing
anything
more
than
live
the
restricted
sordid
little
life
of
a
poorly
equipped
ranch
she
had
ridden
once
with
frank
johnson
to
look
through
a
bunch
of
cattle
but
it
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
hot
thirsty
dull
ride
with
a
wind
that
blew
her
hat
off
in
spite
of
pins
and
tied
veil
and
with
a
companion
who
spoke
only
when
he
was
spoken
to
and
then
as
briefly
as
possible
her
father
would
not
talk
again
as
he
had
talked
that
night
she
had
tried
to
make
him
tell
her
more
about
the
sawtooth
and
had
gotten
nothing
out
of
him
the
man
from
whisper
whom
brit
had
spoken
of
as
al
had
not
returned
nor
had
the
promised
saddle
horse
materialized
the
boys
were
too
busy
to
run
in
any
horses
her
father
had
told
her
shortly
when
she
reminded
him
of
his
promise
when
the
fence
was
done
maybe
he
could
rustle
her
another
horse
and
then
he
had
added
that
he
see
what
ailed
yellowjacket
for
all
the
riding
she
was
likely
to
do
straight
hard
work
and
minding
your
own
business
her
father
had
said
and
it
seemed
to
lorraine
after
three
or
four
days
of
it
that
he
had
summed
up
the
life
of
a
cattleman
daughter
in
a
masterly
manner
which
ought
to
be
recorded
among
famous
sayings
like
war
is
hell
and
give
up
the
ship
on
this
particular
morning
lorraine
spirits
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
if
it
were
not
for
the
new
stepfather
she
would
return
to
the
casa
grande
she
told
herself
disgustedly
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
belief
among
all
her
acquaintances
that
she
was
queening
it
over
the
vast
domain
she
would
return
and
find
work
again
in
motion
pictures
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
the
point
of
facing
the
curiosity
and
the
petty
gossip
of
the
studios
she
would
be
expected
to
explain
satisfactorily
why
she
had
left
the
real
west
for
the
mimic
west
of
hollywood
she
did
not
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
also
could
not
face
the
admission
of
failure
to
carry
out
what
she
had
begun
she
had
told
her
dad
that
she
wanted
to
fight
with
him
even
though
fighting
in
this
case
meant
washing
the
coarse
clothing
of
her
father
and
frank
scrubbing
the
rough
warped
boards
of
the
cabin
floor
and
frying
bacon
for
every
meal
and
in
making
butter
to
sell
and
counting
the
eggs
every
night
and
being
careful
to
use
only
the
cracked
ones
for
cooking
she
hated
every
detail
of
this
crude
housekeeping
from
the
chipped
enamel
dishpan
to
the
broom
that
was
all
and
the
pillow
slips
which
were
nothing
more
nor
less
than
sugar
sacks
she
hated
it
even
more
than
she
had
hated
the
casa
grande
and
her
mother
frowsy
mentality
but
because
she
could
see
that
she
made
life
a
little
more
comfortable
for
her
dad
because
she
felt
that
he
needed
her
she
would
stay
and
assure
herself
over
and
over
that
she
was
staying
merely
because
she
was
too
proud
to
go
back
to
the
old
life
and
own
the
west
a
failure
she
was
sweeping
the
doorstep
with
the
broom
when
brit
drove
out
through
the
gate
and
up
the
trail
which
she
knew
led
eventually
to
sugar
spring
the
horses
sleek
in
their
new
hair
and
skittish
with
the
change
from
hay
to
new
grass
danced
over
the
rough
ground
so
that
the
running
gear
of
the
wagon
with
its
looped
which
would
later
do
duty
as
a
brake
on
the
long
grade
down
from
timber
line
on
the
side
of
spirit
canyon
rattled
and
banged
over
the
rocks
with
a
clatter
that
could
be
heard
for
half
a
mile
lorraine
looked
after
her
father
enviously
if
she
were
a
boy
she
would
be
riding
on
that
sack
of
hay
tied
to
the
hounds
for
a
seat
but
being
a
girl
it
had
never
occurred
to
brit
that
she
might
like
to
go
might
even
be
useful
to
him
on
the
trip
i
suppose
if
i
told
dad
i
could
drive
that
team
as
well
as
he
can
just
look
at
me
and
think
i
was
crazy
she
thought
resentfully
and
gave
the
broom
a
spiteful
fling
toward
a
presumptuous
hen
that
had
approached
too
closely
if
i
asked
him
to
let
me
go
along
he
have
made
some
excuse
oh
i
beginning
to
know
dad
he
thinks
a
woman
place
is
in
the
house
preferably
the
kitchen
and
here
i
thought
all
my
life
that
cowgirls
did
nothing
but
ride
around
and
warn
people
about
stage
holdups
and
everything
i
just
like
to
know
how
a
girl
would
ever
have
a
chance
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
country
unless
she
heard
the
men
talking
while
she
poured
their
coffee
only
this
bunch
do
talk
at
all
they
just
gobble
and
go
she
went
in
then
and
shut
the
door
with
a
slam
up
on
the
ridge
al
woodruff
lowered
his
small
binocular
and
eased
away
from
the
spot
where
he
had
been
crouching
behind
a
bush
every
one
on
the
quirt
ranch
was
accounted
for
as
well
as
if
he
had
sat
at
their
breakfast
table
al
knew
where
each
man
work
would
take
him
that
day
as
for
the
girl
she
was
safe
at
the
ranch
for
the
day
probably
if
she
did
take
a
ride
later
on
it
would
probably
be
up
the
ridge
between
the
quirt
and
ranch
and
sit
for
an
hour
or
so
just
looking
that
ride
was
beginning
to
be
a
habit
of
hers
al
had
observed
so
that
he
considered
her
accounted
for
also
he
made
his
way
along
the
side
hill
to
where
his
horse
was
tied
to
a
bush
mounted
and
rode
away
with
his
mind
pretty
much
at
ease
much
more
at
ease
than
it
would
have
been
had
he
read
what
was
in
lorraine
mind
when
she
slammed
that
door
up
above
sugar
spring
was
timber
by
applying
to
the
nearest
forest
supervisor
a
certain
amount
could
be
had
for
ranch
improvements
upon
paying
a
small
sum
for
the
stumpage
the
quirt
had
permission
to
cut
posts
for
their
new
fence
which
al
woodruff
had
reported
to
his
boss
as
he
drove
up
the
trail
which
was
in
places
barely
passable
for
a
wagon
brit
was
thinking
of
that
fence
the
sawtooth
would
object
to
it
he
knew
since
it
cut
off
one
of
their
stock
trails
and
sent
them
around
through
rougher
country
just
what
form
their
objection
would
take
brit
did
not
know
deep
in
his
intrepid
soul
he
hoped
that
the
sawtooth
would
at
last
show
its
hand
openly
he
had
liked
fred
thurman
and
what
lorraine
had
told
him
went
much
deeper
than
she
knew
he
wanted
to
bring
them
into
the
open
where
he
could
fight
with
some
show
of
winning
i
git
bill
warfield
yet
and
git
him
right
was
the
gist
of
his
musings
he
bound
to
show
his
head
give
him
time
enough
him
and
his
killers
ca
always
keep
under
cover
let
come
at
me
about
that
fence
it
on
my
land
the
quirt
got
a
right
to
fence
every
foot
of
land
that
belongs
to
all
the
way
over
the
ridge
and
across
the
flat
and
up
the
steep
narrow
road
along
the
edge
of
spirit
canyon
brit
dwelt
upon
the
probable
moves
of
the
sawtooth
they
would
wait
he
thought
until
the
fence
was
completed
and
they
had
made
a
trail
around
through
the
lava
rocks
they
would
not
risk
any
move
at
present
they
would
wait
and
tacitly
accept
the
fence
or
pretend
to
accept
it
as
a
natural
inconvenience
but
brit
did
not
deceive
himself
that
they
would
remain
passive
that
it
had
been
hands
off
the
quirt
he
did
not
know
but
attributed
the
immunity
to
careful
habits
and
the
fact
that
they
had
never
come
to
the
point
where
their
interests
actually
clashed
with
the
sawtooth
it
never
occurred
to
him
therefore
that
he
was
slated
for
an
accident
that
day
if
the
details
could
be
conveniently
arranged
it
was
a
long
trail
to
sugar
spring
and
from
there
up
spirit
canyon
the
climb
was
so
tedious
and
steep
that
brit
took
a
full
hour
for
the
trip
resting
the
team
often
because
they
were
soft
from
the
new
grass
diet
and
sweated
easily
they
lost
none
of
their
spirit
however
and
when
the
road
was
steepest
nagged
at
each
other
with
and
bared
teeth
and
ducked
against
each
other
in
pretended
fright
at
every
unusual
rock
or
bush
at
the
top
he
was
forced
to
drive
a
full
half
mile
beyond
the
piled
posts
to
a
flat
large
enough
to
turn
around
all
this
took
time
especially
since
caroline
the
brown
mare
would
rather
travel
ten
miles
straight
ahead
than
go
backward
ten
feet
brit
was
obliged
to
take
it
out
of
her
with
the
rein
ends
and
his
full
repertoire
of
opprobrious
epithets
before
he
could
cramp
the
wagon
and
head
them
down
the
trail
again
at
the
post
pile
he
unhitched
the
team
for
safety
sake
and
tied
them
to
trees
where
he
fed
them
a
little
grain
in
nose
bags
he
was
absorbed
now
in
his
work
and
thought
no
more
about
the
sawtooth
he
fastened
the
log
chain
to
the
rear
wheels
to
brake
the
wagon
on
the
long
grade
down
the
canyon
loaded
the
wagon
with
posts
bound
them
fast
with
a
lighter
chain
he
had
brought
for
the
purpose
ate
his
own
lunch
and
decided
that
since
he
had
made
fair
time
and
would
arrive
home
too
early
to
do
the
chores
and
too
late
to
start
any
other
job
he
would
cruise
farther
up
the
mountain
side
and
see
what
was
the
prospect
of
getting
out
logs
enough
for
an
addition
to
the
cabin
now
that
raine
was
going
to
live
with
him
two
rooms
were
not
enough
brit
wanted
to
make
her
as
happy
as
he
could
in
his
limited
fashion
he
had
for
some
days
been
planning
a
settin
room
and
bedroom
for
her
she
would
be
having
beaux
after
awhile
when
she
got
acquainted
he
supposed
he
could
not
deny
her
the
privilege
she
was
young
and
she
was
in
brit
opinion
the
best
looking
girl
he
had
ever
seen
not
even
excepting
minnie
her
mother
but
he
hoped
she
would
go
off
and
get
married
the
first
thing
she
did
and
one
good
way
to
prevent
that
he
reasoned
was
to
make
her
comfortable
with
him
he
had
noticed
how
pleased
she
was
that
their
cabin
was
of
logs
she
had
even
remarked
that
she
could
not
understand
how
a
rancher
would
ever
want
to
build
a
board
shack
if
there
was
any
timber
to
be
had
well
timber
was
to
be
had
and
she
should
have
her
log
house
though
the
hauling
was
not
going
to
be
any
sunshine
in
brit
opinion
with
his
axe
he
walked
through
the
timber
craning
upward
for
straight
tree
trunks
and
lightly
blazing
the
ones
he
would
want
the
occasional
axe
strokes
sounding
distinctly
in
the
quiet
air
lorraine
heard
them
as
she
rode
old
yellowjacket
puffing
up
the
grade
following
the
wagon
marks
and
knew
that
she
was
nearing
the
end
of
her
journey
for
which
yellowjacket
she
supposed
would
be
thankful
she
had
started
not
more
than
an
hour
later
than
her
father
but
the
team
had
trotted
along
more
briskly
than
her
poor
old
nag
would
travel
so
that
she
did
not
overtake
her
dad
as
she
had
hoped
she
was
topping
the
last
climb
when
she
saw
the
team
tied
to
the
trees
and
at
the
same
moment
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
who
crawled
out
from
under
the
load
of
posts
and
climbed
the
slope
farther
on
she
was
on
the
point
of
calling
out
to
him
thinking
that
he
was
her
dad
when
he
disappeared
into
the
brush
at
the
same
moment
she
heard
the
stroke
of
an
axe
over
to
the
right
of
where
the
man
was
climbing
she
was
riding
past
the
team
when
caroline
humped
her
back
and
kicked
viciously
at
yellowjacket
who
plunged
straight
down
off
the
trail
without
waiting
to
see
whether
caroline
aim
was
exact
he
slid
into
a
juniper
thicket
and
sat
down
looking
very
perplexed
and
very
permanently
placed
there
lorraine
stepped
off
on
the
uphill
side
of
him
thanked
her
lucky
stars
she
had
not
broken
a
leg
and
tried
to
reassure
yellowjacket
and
to
persuade
him
that
no
real
harm
had
been
done
him
straightway
she
discovered
that
yellowjacket
had
a
mind
of
his
own
and
that
a
pessimistic
mind
he
refused
to
scramble
back
into
the
trail
preferring
to
sit
where
he
was
or
since
lorraine
made
that
too
uncomfortable
to
stand
where
he
had
been
sitting
yellowjacket
i
may
explain
owned
a
roman
nose
a
pendulous
lower
lip
and
drooping
eyelids
those
who
know
horses
will
understand
by
the
time
lorraine
had
bullied
and
cajoled
him
into
making
a
somewhat
circuitous
route
to
the
road
where
he
finally
appeared
some
distance
above
the
point
of
his
descent
brit
was
there
hitching
the
team
to
the
wagon
what
yuh
doing
up
there
he
wanted
to
know
looking
up
with
some
astonishment
lorraine
furnished
him
with
details
and
her
opinion
of
both
caroline
and
yellow
jacket
i
simply
refuse
to
ride
this
comedy
animal
another
mile
she
declared
with
some
heat
i
drive
the
team
and
you
can
ride
him
home
or
he
can
be
tied
on
behind
the
wagon
he
wo
lead
brit
objected
yeller
all
right
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
a
few
failin
you
go
ahead
and
ride
him
home
you
sure
drive
this
team
i
can
lorraine
contended
i
driven
four
horses
i
guess
i
can
drive
two
all
right
well
you
ai
going
to
brit
stated
with
a
flat
finality
that
abruptly
ended
the
argument
lorraine
had
never
before
been
really
angry
with
her
father
she
struck
yellowjacket
with
her
quirt
and
sent
him
sidling
past
the
wagon
and
the
tricky
caroline
too
stubborn
to
answer
her
dad
when
he
called
after
her
that
she
had
better
ride
behind
the
load
she
went
on
making
yellowjacket
trot
when
he
did
not
want
to
trot
down
hill
behind
her
she
heard
the
of
the
loaded
wagon
far
ahead
she
heard
some
one
whistling
a
high
sweet
melody
which
had
the
queer
minor
strains
of
some
old
folk
song
for
just
a
few
bars
she
heard
it
and
then
it
was
stilled
and
the
road
dipping
steeply
before
her
seemed
very
lonely
its
emptiness
cooling
her
brief
anger
to
a
depression
that
had
held
her
too
often
in
its
grip
since
that
terrible
night
of
the
storm
for
the
first
time
she
looked
back
at
her
father
lurching
along
on
the
load
and
at
the
team
looking
so
funny
with
the
collars
pushed
up
on
their
necks
with
the
weight
of
the
load
behind
with
a
quick
impulse
of
penitence
she
waved
her
hand
to
brit
who
waved
back
at
her
then
she
went
on
feeling
a
bit
less
alone
in
the
world
after
all
he
was
her
dad
and
his
life
had
been
hard
if
he
failed
to
understand
her
and
her
mental
hunger
for
real
companionship
perhaps
she
also
failed
to
understand
him
they
had
left
the
timber
line
now
and
had
come
to
the
lip
of
the
canyon
itself
lorraine
looked
down
its
steep
sides
and
thought
how
her
old
director
would
have
raved
over
its
possibilities
in
the
way
of
stunts
yellow
jacket
she
noticed
kept
circumspectly
to
the
center
of
the
trail
and
eyed
the
canyon
with
frank
disfavor
she
did
not
know
at
just
what
moment
she
became
aware
of
trouble
behind
her
it
may
have
been
yellowjacket
turning
his
head
sidewise
and
abruptly
quickening
his
pace
that
warned
her
it
may
have
been
the
difference
in
the
sound
of
the
wagon
and
the
impact
of
the
horses
hoofs
on
the
rocky
trail
she
turned
and
saw
that
something
had
gone
wrong
they
were
coming
down
upon
her
at
a
sharp
trot
stepping
high
the
wagon
tongue
thrust
up
between
their
heads
as
they
tried
to
hold
back
the
load
brit
yelled
to
her
then
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
his
voice
was
harsh
and
insistent
lorraine
looked
at
the
steep
bank
to
the
right
knew
instinctively
that
yellowjacket
would
never
have
time
to
climb
it
before
the
team
was
upon
them
and
urged
him
to
a
lope
she
glanced
back
again
saw
that
the
team
was
not
running
away
that
they
were
trying
to
hold
the
wagon
and
that
it
was
gaining
momentum
in
spite
of
them
jump
dad
she
called
and
got
no
answer
brit
was
sitting
braced
with
his
feet
far
apart
holding
and
guiding
the
team
he
wo
jump
he
would
jump
any
more
than
i
would
she
chattered
to
herself
sick
with
fear
for
him
while
she
lashed
her
own
horse
to
keep
out
of
their
way
the
next
she
knew
the
team
was
running
their
eyeballs
staring
their
front
feet
flung
high
as
they
lunged
down
the
trail
the
load
was
rocking
along
behind
them
brit
was
still
braced
and
clinging
to
the
reins
panic
seized
yellowjacket
he
too
went
lunging
down
that
trail
his
head
thrown
from
side
to
side
that
he
might
watch
the
thing
that
menaced
him
heedless
of
the
fact
that
danger
might
lie
ahead
of
him
also
lorraine
knew
that
he
was
running
senselessly
that
he
might
leave
the
trail
at
any
bend
and
go
rolling
into
the
canyon
a
sense
of
unreality
seized
her
it
could
not
be
deadly
earnest
she
thought
it
was
so
exactly
like
some
movie
thrill
planned
carefully
in
advance
rehearsed
perhaps
under
the
critical
eye
of
the
director
and
done
now
with
the
camera
man
turning
calmly
the
little
crank
and
counting
the
number
of
film
feet
the
scene
would
take
a
little
farther
and
she
would
be
out
of
the
scene
and
men
stationed
ahead
would
ride
up
and
stop
her
horse
for
her
and
tell
her
how
well
she
had
put
it
over
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
them
still
coming
it
was
real
it
was
terribly
real
the
way
that
team
was
fleeing
down
the
grade
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
never
seen
horses
so
frantically
trying
to
run
from
the
swaying
load
behind
them
always
she
had
been
accustomed
to
moderation
in
the
pace
and
a
slowed
camera
to
speed
up
the
action
on
the
screen
yellowjacket
too
she
had
never
ridden
at
that
terrific
speed
down
hill
twice
she
lost
a
stirrup
and
grabbed
the
saddle
horn
to
save
herself
from
going
over
his
head
they
neared
a
sharp
turn
and
it
took
all
her
strength
to
pull
her
horse
to
the
inside
and
save
him
from
plunging
off
down
the
canyon
side
the
nose
of
the
hill
hid
for
a
moment
her
dad
and
in
that
moment
she
heard
a
crash
and
knew
what
had
happened
but
she
could
not
stop
yellowjacket
had
his
ears
laid
back
flat
on
his
senseless
head
and
the
bit
clamped
tight
in
his
teeth
she
heard
the
crash
repeated
in
diminuendo
farther
down
in
the
canyon
there
was
no
longer
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
coming
down
the
trail
the
sharp
staccato
of
pounding
hoofs
chapter
eleven
swan
talks
with
his
thoughts
lorraine
following
instinct
rather
than
thought
pulled
yellowjacket
into
the
first
opening
that
presented
itself
this
was
a
narrow
rather
precipitous
gully
that
seamed
the
slope
just
beyond
the
bend
the
bushes
there
whipped
her
head
and
shoulders
cruelly
as
the
horse
forged
in
among
them
but
they
trapped
him
effectually
where
the
gully
narrowed
to
a
point
he
stopped
perforce
and
lorraine
was
out
of
the
saddle
and
running
down
to
the
trail
before
she
quite
realized
what
she
was
doing
at
the
bend
she
looked
down
saw
the
marks
where
the
wagon
had
gone
over
scraping
rocks
and
bushes
from
its
path
fence
posts
were
strewn
at
all
angles
down
the
incline
and
far
down
a
horse
was
standing
with
part
of
the
harness
on
him
and
with
his
head
drooping
dispiritedly
her
father
she
could
not
see
nor
the
other
horse
nor
the
wagon
a
clump
of
young
trees
hid
the
lower
declivity
lorraine
did
not
stop
to
think
of
what
she
would
find
down
there
sliding
running
she
followed
the
traces
of
the
wreck
to
where
the
horse
was
standing
it
was
caroline
looking
very
dejected
but
apparently
unhurt
save
for
skinned
patches
here
and
there
where
she
had
rolled
over
rocks
a
little
farther
just
beyond
the
point
of
the
grove
which
they
seemed
to
have
missed
altogether
lay
the
other
horse
and
what
was
left
of
the
wagon
brit
she
did
not
see
at
all
she
searched
the
bushes
looked
under
the
wagon
and
called
and
called
a
shout
answered
her
from
farther
up
the
canyon
and
she
ran
stumbling
toward
the
sound
too
agonized
to
shed
tears
or
to
think
very
clearly
it
was
not
her
father
voice
she
knew
that
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
no
voice
that
she
had
ever
heard
before
it
had
a
clear
resonance
that
once
heard
would
not
have
been
easily
forgotten
when
she
saw
them
finally
her
father
was
being
propped
up
in
a
position
and
the
strange
man
was
holding
something
to
his
lips
just
a
little
water
i
carry
me
a
bottle
of
water
always
in
my
pocket
said
swan
glancing
up
at
her
when
she
had
reached
them
it
sometimes
makes
a
man
head
think
better
when
he
has
been
hurt
if
he
can
drink
a
little
water
or
something
brit
swallowed
and
turned
his
face
away
from
the
tilted
bottle
i
jumped
but
i
did
jump
quick
enough
he
muttered
thickly
the
chain
pulled
loose
where
the
horses
raine
they
all
right
caroline
standing
over
there
are
you
hurt
much
dad
it
was
a
futile
question
because
brit
was
already
going
off
into
unconsciousness
he
hurt
pretty
bad
swan
declared
honestly
looking
up
at
her
with
his
eyes
grown
serious
i
was
across
the
walley
and
i
saw
him
coming
down
the
road
like
rolling
rocks
down
a
hill
i
came
quick
now
we
make
stretcher
i
think
and
carry
him
home
i
could
take
him
on
my
back
but
that
is
hurting
him
too
much
he
looked
at
her
through
her
it
seemed
to
lorraine
in
spite
of
her
fear
in
spite
of
her
grief
she
felt
that
swan
was
reading
her
very
soul
and
she
backed
away
from
him
i
could
help
your
father
very
much
he
said
soberly
but
i
should
tell
you
a
secret
if
i
do
that
i
should
maybe
ask
that
you
tell
a
lie
if
somebody
asks
questions
could
you
do
that
miss
lie
lorraine
laughed
uncertainly
i
if
that
would
help
dad
swan
was
folding
his
coat
very
carefully
and
placing
it
under
head
my
mother
i
love
like
that
he
said
without
looking
up
my
mother
i
love
so
well
that
i
talk
with
my
thoughts
to
her
sometimes
you
believe
people
can
talk
with
their
thoughts
i
do
know
what
that
got
to
do
with
helping
dad
lorraine
knelt
beside
brit
and
began
stroking
his
forehead
softly
as
is
the
soothing
way
of
women
with
their
sick
i
could
send
my
thought
to
my
mother
i
could
say
to
her
that
a
man
is
hurt
and
that
a
doctor
must
come
very
quickly
to
the
quirt
ranch
i
could
do
that
miss
but
i
should
not
like
it
if
people
knew
that
i
did
it
they
would
maybe
say
that
i
am
crazy
they
would
laugh
at
me
and
it
is
not
right
to
laugh
at
those
things
i
not
laughing
if
you
can
do
it
for
heaven
sake
go
ahead
i
believe
it
but
i
wo
tell
any
one
if
that
what
you
want
if
some
neighbors
should
ask
did
that
doctor
come
so
quick
i
rather
lie
and
say
i
sent
for
him
than
say
that
you
or
any
one
else
sent
a
telepathic
message
that
would
sound
more
like
a
lie
than
a
lie
would
how
are
we
going
to
make
a
stretcher
we
got
to
get
him
home
somehow
at
my
cabin
is
blankets
swan
told
her
briskly
i
can
climb
the
hill
it
is
up
there
in
a
little
while
i
will
come
back
he
started
off
without
waiting
to
see
what
lorraine
would
have
to
say
about
it
and
with
some
misgivings
she
watched
him
run
down
to
the
canyon
bottom
and
go
forging
up
the
opposite
side
with
a
most
amazing
speed
and
certainty
in
travel
pictures
she
had
seen
mountain
sheep
climb
like
that
and
she
likened
him
now
to
one
of
them
it
seemed
a
shame
that
he
was
a
bit
crazy
she
thought
and
immediately
she
recalled
his
perfect
assurance
when
he
told
her
of
sending
thought
messages
to
his
mother
she
had
heard
of
such
things
she
had
even
read
a
little
on
the
subject
but
it
had
never
seemed
to
her
a
practical
means
of
communicating
calling
a
doctor
for
instance
seemed
to
lorraine
rather
an
application
of
what
was
at
best
but
a
debatable
theory
considering
the
distance
he
was
back
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
with
two
blankets
a
couple
of
light
poles
and
a
flask
of
brandy
he
seemed
as
fresh
and
unwinded
as
if
he
had
gone
no
farther
than
the
grove
and
he
wore
more
than
ever
his
air
of
cheerful
assurance
the
doctor
will
be
there
he
remarked
just
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
we
can
carry
him
to
fred
thurman
there
i
can
get
horses
and
a
wagon
and
you
will
not
have
to
carry
so
far
and
when
we
get
to
your
ranch
the
doctor
will
be
there
i
think
he
is
starting
now
we
will
hurry
i
will
fix
it
so
you
need
not
carry
much
it
is
just
to
make
it
steady
for
me
while
he
talked
he
was
working
on
the
stretcher
he
had
a
rope
and
he
was
knotting
it
in
a
long
loop
to
the
poles
lorraine
wondered
why
until
he
had
lifted
her
father
and
placed
him
on
the
stretcher
and
placed
the
loop
over
his
own
head
and
under
one
arm
as
a
ploughman
holds
the
reins
so
that
his
hands
may
be
free
if
you
will
carry
the
front
said
swan
politely
it
will
not
be
heavy
for
you
like
this
but
you
will
help
me
keep
it
steady
lorraine
was
past
discussing
anything
she
obeyed
him
silently
lifting
the
end
of
the
stretcher
and
leading
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
where
swan
assured
her
they
could
walk
quite
easily
and
would
save
many
détours
which
the
road
above
must
take
at
the
bottom
swan
stopped
her
so
that
he
might
shorten
the
rope
and
take
more
of
the
weight
on
his
shoulders
she
protested
but
swan
only
laughed
i
am
strong
like
a
mule
he
said
you
should
see
me
wrestle
with
somebody
clear
over
my
head
i
can
carry
a
man
in
my
hands
this
is
so
you
can
walk
fast
three
miles
straight
down
we
come
to
thurman
ranch
where
i
get
the
horses
it
funny
how
hills
make
a
road
far
around
just
three
miles
that
all
i
have
walked
many
times
lorraine
did
not
answer
him
she
felt
that
he
was
talking
merely
to
keep
her
from
worrying
and
she
was
fairly
sick
with
anxiety
and
did
not
hear
half
of
what
he
was
saying
she
was
nervously
careful
about
choosing
her
steps
so
that
she
would
not
stumble
and
jolt
her
father
she
did
not
believe
that
he
was
wholly
unconscious
for
she
had
seen
his
eyelids
tighten
and
his
lips
twitch
several
times
when
she
was
waiting
for
swan
he
had
seemed
to
be
in
pain
and
to
be
trying
to
hide
the
fact
from
her
she
felt
that
swan
knew
it
else
he
would
have
talked
of
her
dad
would
at
least
have
tried
to
reassure
her
but
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
a
person
who
hears
what
you
are
saying
and
swan
was
talking
of
everything
it
seemed
to
her
except
the
man
they
were
carrying
she
wondered
if
it
were
really
true
that
swan
had
sent
a
call
through
space
for
a
doctor
straightway
she
would
call
herself
crazy
for
even
considering
for
a
moment
its
possibility
if
he
could
do
that
but
of
course
he
could
he
must
just
imagine
it
many
times
swan
had
her
lower
the
stretcher
to
the
ground
and
would
make
a
great
show
of
rubbing
his
arms
and
easing
his
shoulder
muscles
whenever
lorraine
looked
full
into
his
face
he
would
grin
at
her
as
though
nothing
was
wrong
and
when
they
came
to
a
stream
he
emptied
the
water
bottle
dipped
up
a
little
fresh
water
added
brandy
and
lifted
brit
head
very
gently
and
gave
him
a
drink
brit
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
swan
and
from
him
to
lorraine
but
he
did
not
say
anything
he
still
had
that
tightened
look
around
his
mouth
which
spelled
pain
pretty
quick
now
we
get
you
fixed
up
good
swan
told
him
cheerfully
one
mile
more
is
all
and
we
get
the
horses
and
i
make
a
good
bed
for
you
he
looked
a
signal
and
lorraine
once
more
took
up
the
stretcher
another
mile
seemed
a
long
way
light
though
swan
had
made
the
load
for
her
she
thought
once
that
he
must
have
some
clairvoyant
power
because
whenever
she
felt
as
if
her
arms
were
breaking
swan
would
tell
her
to
stop
a
minute
how
do
you
know
a
doctor
will
come
she
asked
swan
suddenly
when
they
were
resting
with
the
thurman
ranch
in
view
half
a
mile
below
them
swan
did
not
look
at
her
directly
as
had
been
his
custom
she
saw
a
darker
shade
of
red
creep
up
into
his
cheeks
my
mother
says
she
would
send
a
doctor
quick
he
replied
hesitatingly
you
will
see
it
is
because
your
father
he
is
not
like
other
men
in
this
country
your
father
is
a
good
man
that
is
why
a
doctor
comes
lorraine
looked
at
him
strangely
and
stooped
again
to
her
burden
she
did
not
speak
again
until
they
were
passing
the
thurman
fence
where
it
ran
up
into
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
a
few
horses
were
grazing
there
the
sun
striking
their
sides
with
the
sheen
of
satin
they
stared
curiously
at
the
little
procession
snorted
and
started
to
run
heads
and
tails
held
high
but
one
wheeled
suddenly
and
came
galloping
toward
them
stopped
when
he
was
quite
close
ducked
and
went
thundering
past
to
the
head
of
the
field
lorraine
gave
a
sharp
little
scream
and
set
down
the
stretcher
with
a
lurch
staring
after
the
horse
her
face
white
they
do
it
for
play
swan
said
reassuringly
they
do
hurt
you
the
fence
is
between
and
they
do
hurt
you
anyway
that
horse
with
the
white
face
i
saw
it
and
when
the
man
struck
it
with
his
quirt
it
went
past
me
running
like
that
and
dragging
she
leaned
against
the
bluff
side
her
face
covered
with
her
two
palms
swan
glanced
down
at
brit
saw
that
his
eyes
were
closed
ducked
his
head
from
under
the
looped
rope
and
went
to
lorraine
the
man
that
struck
that
horse
do
you
know
that
man
he
asked
all
the
good
nature
gone
from
his
voice
no
i
do
know
i
saw
him
twice
by
the
lightning
flashes
he
shot
and
then
i
saw
him
she
stopped
abruptly
stood
for
a
minute
longer
with
her
eyes
covered
then
dropped
her
hands
limply
to
her
sides
but
when
the
horse
came
circling
back
with
a
great
flourish
she
shivered
and
her
hands
closed
into
the
fists
of
a
fighter
are
you
a
sawtooth
man
she
demanded
suddenly
looking
up
at
swan
defiantly
it
was
a
nightmare
i
i
dreamed
once
about
a
horse
like
that
swan
eyes
softened
a
little
the
sawtooth
calls
me
that
damn
swede
on
bear
top
he
explained
i
took
a
homestead
up
there
and
some
day
they
will
want
to
buy
my
place
or
they
will
want
to
make
a
fight
with
me
to
get
the
water
could
you
know
that
man
again
raine
brit
voice
held
a
warning
and
lorraine
shivered
again
as
she
turned
toward
him
raine
you
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
she
could
get
no
further
speech
from
him
but
she
thought
she
understood
he
did
not
want
her
to
talk
about
fred
thurman
she
went
to
her
end
of
the
stretcher
and
waited
there
while
swan
put
the
rope
over
his
head
they
went
on
lorraine
walking
with
her
head
averted
trying
not
to
see
the
roan
trying
to
shut
out
the
memory
of
him
dashing
past
her
with
his
terrible
burden
that
night
swan
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
again
with
lorraine
assistance
he
carried
brit
into
thurman
cabin
laid
him
stretcher
and
all
on
the
bed
and
hurried
out
to
catch
and
harness
the
team
of
work
horses
lorraine
waited
beside
her
father
helpless
and
miserable
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
yet
waiting
seemed
to
her
the
one
thing
she
could
not
do
raine
brit
voice
was
very
weak
but
lorraine
jumped
as
though
a
trumpet
had
bellowed
suddenly
in
her
ear
swan
he
all
right
but
do
go
telling
all
yuh
know
and
some
besides
he
ai
sawtooth
but
he
might
let
out
i
know
i
wo
dad
it
was
that
horse
brit
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
as
if
no
more
was
to
be
said
on
the
subject
lorraine
wandered
around
the
cabin
which
was
no
larger
than
her
father
place
the
rooms
were
scrupulously
clean
neater
than
the
quirt
she
observed
guiltily
not
one
article
however
small
and
unimportant
seemed
to
be
out
of
its
place
and
the
floors
of
both
rooms
were
scrubbed
whiter
than
any
floors
she
had
ever
seen
housekeeping
qualities
made
her
ashamed
of
her
own
imperfections
and
when
thinking
that
swan
must
be
hungry
and
that
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
set
out
food
for
him
she
opened
the
cupboard
she
had
a
swift
embarrassed
vision
of
her
own
culinary
imperfections
she
could
cook
better
food
than
her
dad
had
been
content
to
eat
and
to
set
before
others
but
swan
bread
was
a
triumph
in
sour
dough
biscuits
tall
and
light
as
bread
can
be
she
found
covered
neatly
with
a
cloth
prunes
stewed
so
that
there
was
not
one
single
wrinkle
in
them
lorraine
could
scarcely
believe
they
were
prunes
until
she
tasted
them
she
was
investigating
a
pot
of
beans
when
swan
came
in
food
i
am
thinking
of
miss
he
grinned
at
her
we
shall
hurry
but
it
is
not
good
to
go
hungry
milk
is
outside
in
a
cupboard
it
is
quicker
than
to
make
coffee
it
will
be
dark
before
we
can
get
him
home
said
lorraine
uneasily
and
by
the
time
a
doctor
can
get
out
there
a
doctor
will
be
there
i
think
you
do
believe
but
that
is
no
difference
to
his
coming
just
the
same
he
brought
the
milk
poured
off
the
creamy
top
into
a
pitcher
stirred
it
and
quietly
insisted
that
she
drink
two
glasses
lorraine
observed
that
swan
himself
ate
very
little
bolting
down
a
biscuit
in
great
mouthfuls
while
he
carried
a
mattress
and
blankets
out
to
spread
in
the
wagon
it
was
like
his
pretense
of
weariness
on
the
long
carry
down
the
canyon
she
thought
it
was
for
her
more
than
for
himself
that
he
was
thinking
chapter
twelve
the
quirt
parries
the
first
blow
a
car
with
dimmed
lights
stood
in
front
of
the
quirt
cabin
when
swan
drove
around
the
last
low
ridge
and
down
to
the
gate
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
must
have
been
heard
for
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
frank
stood
revealed
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
kerosene
lamp
on
the
table
within
behind
frank
lorraine
saw
jim
and
sorry
standing
in
their
shirt
sleeves
looking
out
into
the
dark
another
shorter
figure
she
glimpsed
as
frank
and
the
two
men
stepped
out
and
came
striding
hastily
toward
them
lorraine
jumped
out
and
ran
to
meet
them
hoping
and
fearing
that
her
hope
was
foolish
that
car
might
easily
be
only
bob
warfield
on
some
errand
of
no
importance
still
she
hoped
that
you
raine
where
brit
what
all
this
about
brit
being
hurt
a
doctor
from
shoshone
a
oh
did
a
doctor
come
then
oh
help
swan
carry
dad
in
i
oh
i
afraid
he
awfully
injured
but
hell
did
a
doctor
know
about
it
sorry
the
silent
blurted
unexpectedly
oh
never
mind
but
get
dad
in
i
she
ran
past
them
without
finishing
her
sentence
and
burst
incoherently
into
the
presence
of
an
extremely
calm
little
man
with
gray
whiskers
and
dust
on
the
shoulders
of
his
coat
these
details
i
may
add
formed
the
sum
of
first
impression
of
him
well
well
he
remonstrated
with
a
professional
briskness
when
she
nearly
bowled
him
over
we
seem
to
be
in
something
of
a
hurry
is
this
the
patient
i
was
sent
to
examine
no
lorraine
flashed
impatiently
over
her
shoulder
as
she
rushed
into
her
own
room
and
began
turning
down
the
covers
it
dad
of
course
and
you
better
get
your
coat
off
and
get
ready
to
go
to
work
because
i
expect
he
just
one
mass
of
broken
bones
the
doctor
smiled
behind
his
whiskers
and
returned
to
the
doorway
to
direct
the
carrying
in
of
his
patient
his
sharp
eyes
went
immediately
to
brit
face
pallid
under
the
leathery
tan
his
fingers
went
to
brit
hairy
corded
wrist
the
doctor
smiled
no
more
that
evening
no
he
is
not
a
mass
of
broken
bones
i
am
happy
to
say
he
reported
gravely
to
lorraine
afterwards
he
has
a
sufficient
number
however
the
left
scapula
is
fractured
likewise
the
clavicle
and
there
is
a
compound
fracture
of
the
femur
there
is
some
injury
to
the
head
the
exact
extent
of
which
i
can
not
as
yet
determine
he
should
be
removed
to
a
hospital
unless
you
are
prepared
to
have
a
nurse
here
for
some
time
or
to
assume
the
burden
of
a
long
and
tedious
illness
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
the
journey
to
shoshone
would
be
a
considerable
strain
on
the
patient
in
his
present
condition
he
has
a
splendid
amount
of
constitutional
vitality
or
he
would
scarcely
have
survived
his
injuries
so
long
without
medical
attendance
can
you
tell
me
just
how
the
accident
occurred
excuse
me
doctor
and
miss
swan
diffidently
interrupted
i
could
ask
you
to
take
a
look
on
my
shoulder
if
you
please
if
you
are
done
setting
bones
in
hunter
i
have
a
great
pain
on
my
shoulder
from
carrying
so
long
you
never
mentioned
it
lorraine
reproached
him
quickly
of
course
it
must
be
looked
after
right
away
and
then
doctor
i
like
to
talk
to
you
if
you
do
mind
she
watched
them
retreat
to
the
together
swan
big
form
towering
above
the
doctor
slighter
figure
swan
was
talking
earnestly
the
mumble
of
his
voice
reaching
lorraine
without
the
enunciation
of
any
particular
word
to
give
a
clue
to
what
he
was
saying
but
it
struck
her
that
his
voice
did
not
sound
quite
natural
not
so
swedish
not
so
careful
frank
came
tiptoeing
out
of
the
room
where
brit
lay
bandaged
and
unconscious
and
stood
close
to
lorraine
looking
down
at
her
solemnly
how
did
he
git
here
the
doctor
he
demanded
making
a
great
effort
to
hold
his
voice
down
to
a
whisper
and
forgetting
now
and
then
how
know
brit
rolled
the
grade
us
here
never
knowed
it
and
i
was
tryin
to
send
him
back
when
you
came
he
said
somebody
telephoned
there
was
a
man
hurt
in
a
runaway
there
ai
a
telephone
the
sawtooth
and
that
there
a
good
twenty
mile
and
more
from
where
brit
was
hurt
it
damn
funny
yes
it
is
lorraine
admitted
uncomfortably
i
do
know
any
more
than
you
do
about
it
well
did
it
happen
brit
he
oughta
know
enough
to
down
that
hill
an
that
team
ai
a
runaway
team
never
had
no
trouble
with
they
good
at
holdin
a
load
they
set
down
an
slide
but
what
they
hold
what
become
of
the
horses
why
they
over
there
yet
we
forgot
all
about
the
horses
i
think
caroline
was
standing
up
all
right
the
other
horse
may
be
killed
i
do
know
it
was
lying
down
and
yellowjacket
was
up
that
little
gully
just
this
side
of
the
wreck
when
i
left
him
they
did
try
to
hold
the
load
frank
something
must
have
happened
to
the
brake
i
saw
dad
crawling
out
from
under
the
wagon
just
before
i
got
to
where
the
load
was
standing
or
some
one
did
i
think
it
was
dad
but
caroline
kicked
my
horse
down
off
the
road
and
i
only
saw
him
a
minute
but
it
have
been
dad
and
then
a
little
way
down
the
hill
something
went
wrong
frank
seemed
trying
to
reconstruct
the
accident
from
description
he
no
business
to
start
down
if
his
all
right
he
said
it
ai
like
him
brit
careful
about
them
things
little
men
most
always
are
i
do
see
how
it
worked
loose
it
a
damn
queer
layout
all
around
and
this
here
doctor
gitting
here
ahead
of
you
folks
that
there
is
the
queerest
what
he
say
about
brit
think
he
pull
through
the
doctor
himself
coming
up
just
then
answered
the
question
of
course
the
patient
would
pull
through
what
were
doctors
for
as
to
his
reason
for
coming
he
referred
them
to
vjolmar
whom
he
thought
could
better
explain
the
matter
the
three
of
them
waited
five
of
them
since
jim
and
sorry
had
come
up
anxious
to
hear
the
doctor
opinion
and
anything
else
pertaining
to
the
affair
swan
was
coming
slowly
from
the
buttoning
his
coat
he
seemed
to
feel
that
they
were
waiting
for
him
and
to
know
why
his
manner
was
diffident
deprecating
even
we
may
as
well
go
in
out
of
the
mosquitoes
the
doctor
suggested
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
these
people
what
you
told
me
young
man
do
be
afraid
to
speak
frankly
it
is
rather
amazing
but
not
at
all
impossible
as
i
can
testify
in
fact
he
added
dryly
my
presence
here
ought
to
settle
any
doubt
of
that
just
tell
them
young
man
about
your
mother
swan
was
the
last
to
enter
the
kitchen
and
he
stood
leaning
against
the
closed
door
turning
his
old
hat
round
and
round
his
eyes
going
swiftly
from
face
to
face
they
were
watching
him
and
swan
blushed
a
deep
red
while
he
told
them
about
his
mother
in
boise
and
how
he
could
talk
to
her
with
his
thoughts
he
explained
laboriously
how
the
thoughts
from
her
came
like
his
mother
speaking
in
his
head
and
that
his
thoughts
reached
her
in
the
same
way
he
said
that
since
he
was
a
little
boy
they
could
talk
together
with
their
thoughts
but
people
laughed
and
some
called
them
crazy
so
that
now
he
did
not
like
to
have
somebody
know
that
he
could
do
it
but
brit
hunter
hurt
bad
so
a
doctor
must
come
quick
or
i
think
he
maybe
will
die
it
takes
too
long
to
ride
a
horse
to
echo
from
this
ranch
so
i
call
on
my
mother
and
i
tell
my
mother
a
doctor
must
come
quick
to
this
ranch
so
my
mother
sends
a
telephone
to
this
doctor
in
shoshone
and
he
comes
that
is
all
but
i
would
not
like
it
if
everybody
maybe
finds
it
out
that
i
do
that
and
makes
talk
about
it
he
looked
straight
at
jim
and
sorry
and
those
two
unprepossessing
ones
looked
at
each
other
and
at
swan
and
at
the
doctor
and
at
each
other
again
and
headed
for
the
door
but
swan
was
leaning
against
it
and
his
eyes
were
on
them
i
would
like
it
if
you
say
somebody
rides
to
get
the
doctor
he
hinted
quietly
sorry
looked
at
jim
i
rode
like
hell
he
stated
heavily
i
leave
it
to
jim
you
hell
did
jim
agreed
and
swan
removed
his
big
form
from
the
door
you
boys
goin
over
t
spirit
canyon
frank
wanted
to
know
yeah
said
sorry
answering
for
them
both
and
they
went
out
giving
swan
a
sidelong
look
of
utter
bafflement
as
they
passed
him
talking
by
the
thought
route
from
spirit
canyon
to
boise
city
was
evidently
a
bit
too
much
for
even
their
phlegmatic
souls
to
contemplate
with
perfect
calm
they
keep
it
to
theirselves
whether
they
believe
it
or
not
frank
assured
swan
in
his
labored
whisper
it
do
go
down
with
me
i
enough
fer
that
the
doctor
he
comes
do
he
swan
retorted
i
shall
go
back
now
and
milk
the
cows
and
do
chores
but
if
your
shoulder
is
lame
swan
how
can
you
lorraine
asked
in
her
unexpected
fashion
swan
swallowed
and
looked
helplessly
at
the
doctor
who
stood
smoothing
his
chin
the
muscle
strain
is
not
serious
he
said
calmly
a
little
gentle
exercise
will
prevent
further
trouble
i
think
whereupon
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
door
of
the
other
room
glanced
in
at
brit
and
beckoned
lorraine
with
an
upraised
finger
you
have
had
a
hard
time
of
it
yourself
young
lady
he
told
her
you
need
worry
about
swan
he
is
not
suffering
appreciably
i
shall
mix
you
a
very
unpleasant
dose
of
medicine
and
then
i
want
you
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
i
shall
stay
with
your
father
not
that
it
is
necessary
but
because
i
prefer
daylight
for
the
trip
back
to
town
so
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
sit
up
and
wear
yourself
out
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
do
that
while
your
father
bones
mend
he
proceeded
to
mix
the
unpleasant
dose
which
lorraine
swallowed
and
straightway
forgot
in
the
muddle
of
thoughts
that
whirled
confusingly
in
her
brain
little
things
distressed
her
oddly
while
her
desperate
state
left
her
numb
she
lay
down
on
the
cot
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
kitchen
where
her
father
had
slept
just
last
night
it
seemed
so
long
ago
and
almost
immediately
as
her
senses
recorded
it
bright
sunlight
was
shining
into
the
room
chapter
thirteen
lone
takes
his
stand
lone
morgan
over
at
elk
spring
camp
was
just
sitting
down
to
eat
his
midday
meal
when
some
one
shouted
outside
lone
stiffened
in
his
chair
felt
under
his
coat
and
then
got
up
with
some
deliberation
and
looked
out
of
the
window
before
he
went
to
the
door
all
this
was
a
matter
of
habit
bred
of
lone
youth
in
the
feud
country
and
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
conscience
hello
he
called
standing
in
the
doorway
and
grinning
a
welcome
to
swan
who
stood
with
one
arm
resting
on
the
board
gate
she
on
the
table
come
on
in
i
do
know
if
you
home
with
the
door
shut
like
that
swan
explained
coming
up
to
the
cabin
i
chased
a
coyote
from
rock
city
to
here
and
by
golly
he
going
yet
i
get
him
sometime
maybe
smart
but
you
can
beat
anything
with
thinking
if
you
do
stop
thinking
always
the
other
feller
stops
sometimes
and
then
you
get
him
you
believe
that
it
most
generally
works
out
that
way
lone
admitted
getting
another
plate
and
cup
from
the
cupboard
which
was
merely
a
box
nailed
with
its
bottom
to
the
wall
and
a
flour
sack
tacked
across
the
front
for
a
curtain
even
a
coyote
slips
up
now
and
then
i
reckon
swan
sat
down
smoothing
his
tousled
yellow
hair
with
both
hands
as
he
did
so
by
golly
my
shoulder
is
sore
yet
from
carrying
brit
hunter
he
remarked
carelessly
flexing
his
muscles
and
grimacing
a
little
lone
was
pouring
the
coffee
and
he
ran
swan
cup
over
before
he
noticed
what
he
was
doing
swan
looked
up
at
him
and
looked
away
again
reaching
for
a
cloth
to
wipe
the
spilled
coffee
from
the
table
how
was
that
lone
asked
turning
away
to
the
stove
happened
to
brit
hunter
swan
with
his
plate
filled
and
his
coffee
well
sweetened
proceeded
to
relate
with
much
detail
the
story
of
brit
misfortune
by
golly
i
do
see
how
he
do
get
killed
he
finished
helping
himself
to
another
biscuit
by
i
do
falling
into
spirit
canyon
is
like
getting
dragged
by
a
horse
it
should
kill
a
man
what
you
think
lone
it
did
you
say
lone
eyes
were
turned
to
his
coffee
cup
it
do
kill
brit
hunter
not
yet
i
think
maybe
he
dies
with
all
his
bones
broke
like
that
by
golly
that
shows
you
what
could
happen
if
a
man
do
think
brit
should
look
at
that
chain
on
his
wheel
before
he
starts
down
that
road
oh
his
brake
did
hold
eh
i
look
at
that
wagon
swan
answered
carefully
it
is
something
funny
about
that
chain
i
worked
hauling
logs
in
the
mountains
once
it
is
something
damn
funny
about
that
chain
the
way
it
fixed
lone
did
not
ask
him
for
particulars
as
perhaps
swan
expected
he
did
not
speak
at
all
for
awhile
but
presently
pushed
back
his
plate
as
if
his
appetite
were
gone
it
like
fred
thurman
swan
continued
moralizing
if
fred
do
ride
backwards
i
bet
he
do
get
killed
like
that
where
brit
now
lone
asked
getting
up
and
putting
on
his
hat
at
the
ranch
or
heaven
maybe
swan
responded
sententiously
but
my
dog
yack
he
do
howl
yet
i
guess
brit
at
the
ranch
sorry
i
busy
said
lone
opening
the
door
you
stay
as
long
as
you
like
swan
i
got
some
riding
to
do
i
wash
the
dishes
and
then
i
maybe
will
think
quicker
than
that
coyote
i
after
him
by
golly
till
i
get
him
lone
muttered
something
and
went
out
within
five
minutes
swan
hearing
hoofbeats
looked
out
through
a
crack
in
the
door
and
saw
lone
riding
at
a
gallop
along
the
trail
to
rock
city
good
bait
he
swallows
the
hook
he
commented
to
himself
and
his
grin
was
not
brightening
his
face
while
he
washed
the
dishes
and
tidied
the
cabin
with
lone
rode
bitterness
of
soul
and
a
sick
fear
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
destiny
how
long
ago
brit
had
been
hurled
into
the
canyon
lone
did
not
know
he
had
not
asked
but
he
judged
that
it
must
have
been
very
recently
swan
had
not
told
him
of
anything
but
the
runaway
and
of
helping
to
carry
brit
home
and
of
the
damn
funny
thing
about
the
chain
the
he
must
have
meant
too
well
lone
understood
the
sinister
meaning
that
probably
lay
behind
that
phrase
they
started
on
the
quirt
now
he
told
himself
with
foreboding
she
been
telling
her
father
lone
fell
into
bitter
argument
with
himself
just
how
far
was
it
justifiable
to
mind
his
own
business
and
if
he
did
not
mind
it
what
possible
chance
had
he
against
a
power
so
ruthless
and
so
cunning
an
accident
to
a
man
driving
a
loaded
wagon
down
the
spirit
canyon
grade
had
a
diabolic
plausibility
that
no
man
in
the
country
could
question
brit
he
reasoned
could
not
have
known
before
he
started
that
his
had
been
tampered
with
else
he
would
have
fixed
it
neither
was
brit
the
man
to
forget
the
brake
on
his
load
if
brit
lived
he
might
talk
as
much
as
he
pleased
but
he
could
never
prove
that
his
accident
had
been
deliberately
staged
with
murderous
intent
lone
lifted
his
head
and
looked
away
across
the
empty
miles
of
sageland
to
the
quiet
blue
of
the
mountains
beyond
peace
the
peace
of
untroubled
wilderness
brooded
over
the
land
far
in
the
distance
against
the
rim
of
rugged
hills
was
an
irregular
splotch
of
brown
which
was
the
headquarters
of
the
sawtooth
lone
turned
his
wrist
to
the
right
and
john
doe
obeying
the
rein
signal
left
the
trail
and
began
picking
his
way
down
the
steep
slope
of
the
ridge
heading
directly
toward
the
home
ranch
john
doe
was
streaked
with
sweat
and
his
flanks
were
palpitating
with
fatigue
when
lone
rode
up
to
the
corral
and
dismounted
pop
bridgers
saw
him
and
came
eagerly
forward
with
gossip
titillating
on
his
meddlesome
tongue
but
lone
stalked
by
him
with
only
a
surly
nod
bob
warfield
he
saw
at
a
distance
and
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
he
met
hawkins
coming
down
from
his
house
and
stopped
in
the
trail
have
you
got
time
to
go
back
to
the
office
and
fix
up
my
time
hawkins
he
asked
without
prelude
i
quitting
hawkins
stared
and
named
the
biblical
place
of
torment
what
yuh
quittin
for
lone
he
added
incredulously
all
you
boys
got
a
raise
last
month
ai
that
good
enough
plenty
good
enough
so
long
as
i
work
for
the
outfit
well
what
wrong
you
been
with
us
five
years
lone
and
suited
you
all
right
so
far
lone
looked
at
him
say
i
never
set
out
to
the
sawtooth
he
stated
calmly
and
if
i
have
married
by
accident
you
can
get
a
bill
of
divorce
for
desertion
this
ai
the
first
time
a
man
ever
quit
yuh
is
it
hawkins
no
and
there
ai
a
man
on
the
pay
roll
we
ca
do
without
hawkins
retorted
his
neck
stiffening
with
resentment
it
a
kinda
rusty
trick
though
lone
quittin
without
notice
and
leaving
a
camp
empty
elk
spring
wo
run
away
lone
assured
him
without
emotion
been
left
alone
a
week
or
two
at
a
time
during
roundups
i
do
reckon
the
outfit
bust
up
before
you
get
a
man
down
there
the
foreman
looked
at
him
curiously
for
this
was
not
like
lone
whose
tone
had
always
been
soft
and
friendly
and
whose
manner
had
no
hint
of
brusqueness
there
was
a
light
too
in
lone
eyes
that
had
not
been
there
before
but
hawkins
would
not
question
him
further
if
lone
morgan
or
any
other
man
wanted
to
quit
that
was
his
privilege
providing
of
course
that
his
leaving
was
not
likely
to
menace
the
peace
and
security
of
the
sawtooth
lone
had
made
it
a
point
to
mind
his
own
business
always
he
had
never
asked
questions
he
had
never
surmised
or
gossiped
so
hawkins
gave
him
a
check
for
his
wages
and
let
him
go
with
no
more
than
a
foreman
natural
reluctance
to
lose
a
trustworthy
man
by
hard
riding
along
short
cuts
lone
reached
the
quirt
ranch
and
dropped
reins
at
the
doorstep
not
much
past
i
rode
over
to
see
if
there
anything
i
can
do
he
said
when
lorraine
opened
the
door
to
him
he
did
not
like
to
ask
about
her
father
fearing
that
the
news
would
be
bad
why
thank
you
for
coming
lorraine
stepped
back
tacitly
inviting
him
to
enter
dad
knows
us
but
of
course
he
terribly
hurt
and
ca
talk
much
we
do
need
some
one
to
go
to
town
for
things
frank
helps
me
with
dad
and
jim
and
sorry
are
trying
to
keep
things
going
on
the
ranch
and
swan
does
what
he
can
of
course
but
i
just
thought
you
maybe
needed
somebody
right
bad
said
lone
quietly
meaning
a
great
deal
more
than
lorraine
dreamed
that
he
meant
i
not
doing
anything
at
all
right
now
so
i
can
just
as
well
help
out
as
not
i
can
go
to
town
right
away
if
i
can
borrow
a
horse
john
doe
he
pretty
tired
i
been
pushing
him
right
through
not
knowing
there
was
a
town
trip
ahead
of
him
lorraine
found
her
eyes
going
misty
he
was
so
quiet
and
so
reassuring
in
his
quiet
half
her
burden
seemed
to
slip
from
her
shoulders
while
she
looked
at
him
she
turned
away
groping
for
the
door
latch
you
may
see
dad
if
you
like
while
i
get
the
list
of
things
the
doctor
ordered
he
left
only
a
little
while
ago
and
i
was
waiting
for
one
of
the
boys
to
come
back
so
i
could
send
him
to
town
it
was
on
lone
tongue
to
ask
why
the
doctor
had
not
taken
in
the
order
himself
and
instructed
some
one
to
bring
out
the
things
but
he
remembered
how
very
busy
with
its
own
affairs
was
echo
and
decided
that
the
doctor
was
wise
he
tiptoed
in
to
the
bed
and
saw
a
sallow
face
covered
with
stubbly
gray
whiskers
and
framed
with
white
bandages
brit
opened
his
eyes
and
moved
his
thin
lips
in
some
kind
of
greeting
and
lone
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
feeling
as
miserably
guilty
as
if
he
himself
had
brought
the
old
man
to
this
pass
it
seemed
to
him
that
brit
must
know
more
of
the
accident
than
swan
had
told
and
the
thought
did
not
add
to
his
comfort
he
waited
until
brit
opened
his
eyes
again
and
then
he
leaned
forward
holding
brit
wandering
glance
with
his
own
intent
gaze
i
ai
working
now
he
said
lowering
his
voice
so
that
lorraine
could
not
hear
so
i
going
to
stay
here
and
help
see
you
through
with
this
i
quit
the
sawtooth
brit
eyes
cleared
and
studied
lone
face
know
anything
no
i
do
lone
face
hardened
a
little
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
with
the
quirt
now
frank
hire
yuh
no
i
ai
hired

all

just
yuh

need

said
brit
grimly
looking
lone
straight
in
the
eyes
chapter

dead
frank
come
yet
the
peevish
impatience
of
an
invalid
whose
horizon
has
narrowed
to
his
own
personal
welfare
and
wants
was
in
brit
voice
two
weeks
he
had
been
sick
and
his
temper
had
not
sweetened
with
the
pain
of
his
broken
bones
and
the
enforced
idleness
brit
was
the
type
of
man
who
is
never
quiet
unless
he
is
asleep
or
too
ill
to
get
out
of
bed
lorraine
came
to
the
doorway
and
looked
in
at
him
two
weeks
had
set
their
mark
on
her
also
she
seemed
older
quieter
in
her
ways
there
were
shadows
in
her
eyes
and
a
new
seriousness
in
the
set
of
her
mouth
she
had
had
her
burdens
and
she
had
borne
them
with
more
patience
than
many
an
older
woman
would
have
done
but
what
she
thought
of
those
burdens
she
did
not
say
no
dad

little
while

anxious

all
brit

what
was
you
lone
talkin
so
long
about
out
in
the
kitchen
last
night
seems
to
me
you
him
have
got
a
lot
to
say
to
each
other
raine
why
nothing
in
particular
we
were
just
talking
we
all
human
beings
dad
we
have
to
talk
sometimes
there
nothing
else
to
do
well
i
caught
something
about
the
sawtooth
i
do
want
you
talking
to
lone
or
anybody
else
about
that
outfit
raine
i
told
yuh
so
once
he
all
right
i
ai
saying
anything
against
lone
but
the
less
you
have
to
say
the
more
you
have
to
be
thankful
fur
mebby
i
was
wondering
if
swan
could
have
gotten
word
somehow
to
the
sawtooth
and
had
them
telephone
out
that
you
were
hurt
and
lone
was
drawing
a
map
of
the
trails
and
showing
me
how
far
it
was
from
the
canyon
to
the
sawtooth
ranch
and
he
was
asking
me
just
how
it
happened
that
the
brake
did
hold
and
i
said
it
must
have
been
all
right
because
i
saw
you
come
out
from
under
the
wagon
just
before
you
hitched
up
i
thought
you
were
fixing
the
chain
on
them
huh
brit
lifted
his
head
off
the
pillow
and
let
it
drop
back
again
because
of
the
pain
in
his
shoulder
you
never
seen
me
crawl
out
from
under
no
wagon
i
come
straight
down
the
hill
to
the
team
well
i
saw
some
one
he
went
up
into
the
brush
i
thought
it
was
you
lorraine
turned
in
the
doorway
and
stood
looking
at
him
perplexedly
we
should
be
talking
about
it
dad
the
doctor
said
we
must
but
are
you
it
was
you
because
i
certainly
saw
a
man
crawl
out
from
under
the
wagon
and
start
up
the
hill
then
the
horses
acted
up
and
i
could
see
him
after
yellowjacket
jumped
off
the
road
brit
lay
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
apparently
unheeding
her
explanation
lorraine
watched
him
for
a
minute
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
door
peering
out
and
listening
for
frank
to
come
from
echo
with
supplies
and
the
mail
and
more
important
just
now
fresh
fruit
for
her
father
i
think
he
coming
dad
she
called
in
to
her
father
i
just
heard
something
down
by
the
gate
she
could
save
a
few
minutes
she
thought
by
running
down
to
the
corral
where
frank
would
probably
stop
and
unload
the
few
sacks
of
grain
he
was
bringing
before
he
drove
up
to
the
house
frank
was
very
methodical
in
a
fussy
purposeless
way
she
had
observed
twice
he
had
driven
to
echo
since
her
father
had
been
hurt
and
each
time
he
had
stopped
at
the
corral
on
his
way
to
the
house
so
she
closed
the
screen
door
behind
her
careful
that
it
should
not
slam
and
ran
down
the
path
in
the
heavy
dusk
wherein
crickets
were
rasping
a
strident
chorus
oh
it
you
is
it
lone
she
exclaimed
when
she
neared
the
vague
figure
of
a
man
unsaddling
a
horse
you
did
see
frank
coming
anywhere
did
you
dad
wo
have
his
supper
until
frank
comes
with
the
things
i
sent
for
he
late
lone
was
lifting
the
saddle
off
the
back
of
john
doe
which
he
had
bought
from
the
sawtooth
because
he
was
fond
of
the
horse
he
hesitated
and
replaced
the
saddle
pulling
the
blanket
straight
under
it
i
saw
him
coming
an
hour
ago
he
said
i
was
back
up
on
the
ridge
and
i
saw
a
team
turn
into
the
quirt
trail
from
the
ford
it
could
be
anybody
but
frank
i
ride
out
and
meet
him
he
was
mounted
and
gone
before
she
realized
that
he
was
ready
she
heard
the
sharp
staccato
of
john
doe
hoofbeats
and
wondered
why
lone
had
not
waited
for
another
word
from
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
told
him
that
frank
was
in
some
terrible
danger
yet
she
had
merely
complained
that
he
was
late
the
door
opened
and
sorry
came
out
on
the
doorstep
stood
there
a
minute
and
came
slowly
to
meet
her
as
she
retraced
her
steps
to
the
house
where
lone
go
so
sudden
he
asked
when
she
came
close
to
him
in
the
dusk
that
was
him
was
it
lorraine
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
him
without
speaking
a
vague
terror
had
seized
her
she
wanted
to
scream
and
yet
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
scream
over
it
was
lone
haste
she
told
herself
impatiently
her
nerves
were
ragged
from
nursing
her
dad
and
from
worrying
over
things
she
must
not
talk
about
that
forbidden
subject
which
never
left
her
mind
for
long
was
that
him
sorry
repeated
uneasily
what
took
him
off
again
in
such
a
rush
oh
i
do
know
he
said
frank
should
have
been
here
long
ago
he
went
to
look
for
him
sorry
she
cried
suddenly
what
the
matter
with
this
place
i
feel
as
if
something
horrible
was
just
ready
to
jump
out
at
us
all
i
i
want
my
back
against
something
solid
all
the
time
so
that
nothing
can
creep
up
behind
nothing
she
added
desperately
could
happen
to
frank
between
here
and
the
at
the
ford
could
it
lone
saw
him
turn
into
our
trail
over
an
hour
ago
he
said
sorry
his
fingers
thrust
into
his
overalls
pockets
his
thumbs
hooked
over
the
waistband
spat
into
the
sand
beside
the
path
well
he
started
off
with
a
cracked
doubletree
he
said
slowly
he
mighta
busted
pullin
through
that
sand
hollow
she
was
wired
up
pretty
good
though
and
there
was
more
wire
in
the
rig
i
do
know
of
anything
else
that
be
liable
to
happen
unless
unless
what
lorraine
prompted
sharply
there
too
much
that
talked
about
on
this
ranch
what
else
could
happen
sorry
edged
away
from
her
well
i
dunno
as
anything
would
be
liable
to
happen
he
said
uncomfortably
likely
him
brit
both
have
accidents
not
right
lorraine
felt
her
throat
squeeze
together
sorry
you
do
mean
sawtooth
accidents
she
blurted
she
surprised
a
grunt
out
of
sorry
who
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
feared
eavesdroppers
where
you
git
that
idee
he
demanded
i
dunno
what
you
mean
ai
that
yore
dad
callin
yuh
lorraine
ignored
the
hint
you
know
what
i
mean
why
did
you
say
they
would
both
be
likely
to
have
accidents
and
why
do
you
something
why
does
every
one
just
keep
still
and
let
things
happen
and
not
say
a
word
if
there
any
chance
of
frank
having
an
an
i
should
think
you
be
out
looking
after
him
and
not
standing
there
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
just
waiting
to
see
if
he
shows
up
or
if
he
does
show
up
you
all
just
like
these
rabbits
out
in
the
sage
you
hide
under
a
bush
and
wait
until
almost
stepped
on
before
you
so
much
as
wiggle
an
ear
i
getting
good
and
tired
of
this
meek
business
sorry
drawled
amiably
as
she
went
past
him
mebby
do
look
purty
but
it
dern
good
life
insurance
a
coward
policy
lorraine
taunted
him
over
her
shoulder
and
went
to
see
what
her
father
wanted
when
he
too
wanted
to
know
why
lone
had
come
and
gone
again
in
such
a
hurry
lorraine
felt
all
the
courage
go
out
of
her
at
once
their
very
uneasiness
seemed
to
prove
that
there
was
more
than
enough
cause
for
it
yet
when
she
forced
herself
to
stop
and
think
it
was
all
about
nothing
frank
had
driven
to
echo
and
had
not
returned
exactly
on
time
though
a
dozen
things
might
have
detained
him
she
was
listening
at
the
door
when
swan
appeared
unexpectedly
before
her
having
walked
over
from
the
thurman
ranch
after
doing
the
chores
to
him
she
observed
that
frank
was
an
hour
late
and
swan
whistling
softly
to
jack
lorraine
was
surprised
to
hear
how
closely
the
call
resembled
the
chirp
of
a
bird
strode
away
without
so
much
as
a
pretense
at
excuse
lorraine
stared
after
him
wondering
and
yet
not
daring
to
wonder
her
father
called
to
her
fretfully
and
she
went
in
to
him
again
and
told
him
what
sorry
had
said
about
the
cracked
doubletree
and
persuaded
him
to
let
her
bring
his
supper
at
once
and
to
have
the
fruit
later
when
frank
arrived
brit
did
not
say
much
but
she
sensed
his
uneasiness
and
her
own
increased
in
proportion
later
she
saw
two
tiny
glowing
points
down
by
the
corral
and
knew
that
sorry
and
jim
were
down
there
waiting
and
listening
ready
to
do
whatever
was
needed
of
them
although
what
that
would
be
she
could
not
even
conjecture
she
made
her
father
comfortable
chattered
aimlessly
to
combat
her
understanding
of
his
moody
silence
and
listened
and
waited
and
tried
her
pitiful
best
not
to
think
that
anything
could
be
wrong
the
subdued
chuckling
of
the
wagon
in
the
sand
outside
the
gate
startled
her
with
its
unmistakable
reality
after
so
many
false
impressions
that
she
heard
it
frank
coming
dad
she
announced
relievedly
and
i
go
and
get
the
mail
and
the
fruit
she
ran
down
the
path
again
almost
in
her
relief
from
that
vague
terror
which
had
held
her
for
the
past
hour
from
the
corral
sorry
and
jim
came
walking
up
the
path
to
meet
the
wagon
which
was
making
straight
for
the
instead
of
going
first
to
the
stable
one
man
rode
on
the
seat
driving
the
team
which
walked
slowly
oddly
reminding
lorraine
of
a
funeral
procession
beside
the
wagon
rode
lone
his
head
drooped
a
little
in
the
starlight
it
was
not
until
the
team
stopped
before
the
that
lorraine
knew
what
it
was
that
gave
her
that
strange
creepy
feeling
of
disaster
it
was
not
frank
johnson
but
swan
vjolmar
who
climbed
limberly
down
from
the
seat
without
speaking
and
turned
toward
the
back
of
the
wagon
why
where
frank
she
asked
going
up
to
where
lone
was
dismounting
in
silence
he
there
in
the
wagon
we
picked
him
up
back
here
about
of
a
mile
or
so
what
the
matter
is
he
drunk
this
was
sorry
who
came
up
to
swan
and
stood
ready
to
lend
a
hand
he
so
drunk
he
falls
out
of
wagon
down
the
road
but
he
do
have
whisky
smell
by
his
face
was
swan
ambiguous
reply
he
not
hurt
is
he
lorraine
pressed
close
and
felt
a
hand
on
her
arm
pulling
her
gently
away
he
hurt
lone
said
just
behind
her
we
take
him
into
the
and
bring
him
to
run
along
to
the
house
and
do
worry
and
do
say
anything
to
your
dad
either
there
no
need
to
bother
him
about
it
we
look
after
frank
already
swan
and
sorry
and
jim
were
lifting
frank
limp
form
from
the
rear
of
the
wagon
it
sagged
in
their
arms
like
a
dead
thing
and
lorraine
stepped
back
shuddering
as
they
passed
her
a
minute
later
she
followed
them
inside
where
jim
was
lighting
the
lamp
with
shaking
fingers
by
the
glow
of
the
match
lorraine
saw
how
sober
jim
looked
how
his
chin
was
trembling
under
the
drooping
sandy
mustache
she
stared
at
him
hating
to
read
the
emotion
in
his
heavy
face
that
she
had
always
thought
so
utterly
void
of
feeling
it
is
he
is
she
began
and
turned
upon
swan
who
was
beside
the
bunk
looking
down
at
frank
upturned
face
swan
if
it
serious
enough
for
a
doctor
ca

send
another
thought
message
to
your
mother
she
asked
he

swan
turned
his
head
and
stared
down
at
her
and
from
her
face
his
glance
went
sharply
to
lone
downcast
face
he
looked
again
at
lorraine
i
ca

with
my
mind
swan
told
her
bluntly
not
always
i
can
do
that
i
could
ask

off
the

at

found
a
half
bottle
of
whisky
in
his
pocket
but
swan
right
there

a
smell
of
it
on
his
breath
i
tell
you
now

that

was
lying
in

was

to
his
senses

out
his
knife
and
opened
the
small
blade
he
moved
so
that
his
back
was
to
lorraine
and
still
holding
the
wrist
he
made
a
small
clean
cut
in
the
flesh

lips
at

incision

a

at

was
striding
toward
the
place

had
been
found

his
face
moody
his
eyes
clouded
with
thought

beside

flipped

they
left
the
ranch
where
jim
was
wandering
dismally
here
and
there
trying
to
do
the
chores
when
his
heart
was
heavy
with
a
sense
of
personal
loss
and
grim
foreboding
none
save
brit
had
slept
during
the
night
and
brit
had
slept
only
because
lorraine
had
prudently
given
him
a
full
dose
of
the
sedative
left
by
the
doctor
for
that
very
purpose
sorry
had
gone
to
echo
to
send
a
telegram
to
the
coroner
and
he
was
likely
to
return
now
at
any
time
wherefore
swan
and
lone
were
going
to
look
over
the
ground
before
others
had
trampled
out
what
evidence
there
might
be
in
the
shape
of
footprints
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
team
had
stopped
of
its
own
accord
in
crossing
a
little
green
meadow
and
had
gone
to
feeding
lone
pulled
up
and
half
turned
in
the
saddle
looking
at
swan
questioningly
is
that
dog
of
yours
any
good
at
trailing
he
asked
abruptly
got
a
theory
that
somebody
was
in
that
wagon
with
frank
and
drove
on
a
ways
before
he
jumped
out
i
believe
if
you
put
that
dog
on
the
trail
if
i
put
that
dog
on
the
trail
he
stays
on
the
trail
all
day
maybe
swan
averred
with
some
pride
by
golly
he
follows
a
coyote
till
he
drops
well
it
a
coyote
we
after
now
said
lone
a
that
has
made
his
last
killin
right
here
where
i
rode
up
and
caught
the
team
last
night
we
better
take
a
look
along
here
for
tracks
swan
stared
at
him
curiously
but
he
did
not
speak
and
the
two
went
on
more
slowly
their
glances
roving
here
and
there
along
the
trail
edge
looking
for
footprints
once
the
dog
jack
swung
off
the
trail
into
the
brush
and
swan
followed
him
while
lone
stopped
and
awaited
the
result
swan
came
back
presently
with
jack
sulking
at
his
heels
yack
he
take
up
the
trail
of
a
coyote
swan
explained
but
it
got
the
four
legs
and
yack
he
do
understand
me
when
i
do
follow
he
thinks
i
crazy
this
morning
i
reckon
the
team
came
on
toward
home
after
the
fellow
jumped
out
lone
observed
he
plan
that
way
seems
to
me
i
know
i
would
i
guess
that
right
i
do
have
experience
in
killing
somebody
swan
returned
blandly
and
lone
was
too
preoccupied
to
wonder
at
the
unaccustomed
sarcasm
a
little
farther
along
swan
swooped
down
upon
a
blue
dotted
handkerchief
of
the
kind
which
men
find
so
useful
where
laundries
are
but
a
name
again
lone
stopped
and
bent
to
examine
it
as
swan
spread
it
out
in
his
hands
a
few
tiny
grains
of
sandstone
rattled
out
and
in
the
center
was
a
small
blood
spot
swan
looked
up
straight
into
lone
dark
brooding
eyes
by
golly
lone
you
would
do
that
too
if
you
kill
somebody
he
began
in
a
new
tone
the
tone
which
lorraine
had
heard
indistinctly
in
the
when
swan
was
talking
to
the
doctor
do
you
think
i
a
damn
fool
just
because
i
a
swede
you
are
smart
you
think
out
every
little
thing
but
you
make
a
big
mistake
if
you
do
think
some
one
else
may
be
using
his
brain
too
this
handkerchief
i
have
seen
you
pull
from
your
pocket
too
many
times
and
it
had
a
rock
in
it
last
night
and
the
blood
shows
that
it
was
used
to
hit
frank
behind
the
ear
you
think
it
all
out
but
maybe
i
been
thinking
too
now
you
under
arrest
just
stay
on
your
horse
he
ca
run
faster
than
a
bullet
and
i
miss
coyotes
when
i
shoot
them
on
the
run
the
hell
you
say
lone
stared
at
him
where
your
authority
swan
swan
lifted
the
rifle
to
a
comfortable
firing
position
the
muzzle
pointing
straight
at
lone
chest
with
his
left
hand
he
turned
back
his
coat
and
disclosed
a
badge
pinned
to
the
lining
i
a
united
states
marshal
that
all
a
government
hunter
he
stated
i
hot
on
the
trail
of
coyotes
all
kinds
throw
that
over
there
in
the
brush
will
you
i
hate
to
get
the
barrel
all
sanded
up
lone
objected
mildly
you
can
pack
it
ca
you
he
grinned
a
little
as
he
handed
out
the
gun
muzzle
toward
himself
you
playing
safe
swan
but
if
that
dog
of
yours
is
any
good
you
have
a
change
of
heart
pretty
quick
that
a
man
track
just
beside
that
flat
rock
put
the
dog
on
why
do
you
yack
is
on
already
swan
pointed
out
ride
ahead
of
me
lone
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
lone
obeyed
following
the
dog
as
it
trotted
through
the
brush
on
the
trail
of
a
man
footprints
which
swan
had
shown
it
a
man
might
have
had
some
trouble
in
keeping
to
the
trail
but
jack
trotted
easily
along
and
never
once
seemed
at
fault
in
a
very
few
minutes
he
stopped
in
a
rocky
depression
where
a
horse
had
been
tied
and
waited
for
swan
wagging
his
tail
and
showing
his
teeth
in
a
panting
smile
the
man
he
had
trailed
had
mounted
and
ridden
toward
the
ridge
to
the
west
swan
examined
the
tracks
and
lone
sat
on
his
horse
watching
him
jack
picked
up
the
trail
where
the
horseman
had
walked
away
toward
the
road
and
swan
followed
him
motioning
lone
to
ride
ahead
you
could
tell
me
about
this
i
think
but
i
can
find
out
for
myself
he
observed
glancing
at
lone
briefly
sure
you
can
find
out
if
you
use
your
eyes
and
do
a
little
thinking
lone
replied
i
hope
you
do
lay
the
evidence
on
the
right
doorstep
i
will
swan
promised
looking
ahead
to
where
jack
was
nosing
his
way
through
the
sagebrush
they
brought
up
at
the
edge
of
the
road
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
nearer
echo
than
the
place
where
frank
body
had
been
found
they
saw
where
the
man
had
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
followed
to
where
they
had
found
frank
beside
the
road
lying
just
as
he
had
pitched
forward
from
the
wagon
seat
i
think
said
swan
quietly
we
will
go
now
and
find
out
where
that
horse
went
last
night
a
good
idea
lone
agreed
do
you
see
how
it
was
done
swan
when
he
saw
the
team
coming
away
back
toward
echo
he
rode
down
into
that
wash
and
tied
his
horse
he
was
walking
when
frank
overtook
him
i
reckon
maybe
claiming
his
horse
had
broke
away
from
him
he
had
a
rock
in
his
handkerchief
frank
stopped
and
gave
him
a
lift
and
he
used
the
rock
first
chance
he
got
then
i
reckon
he
stuck
the
whisky
bottle
in
frank
pocket
and
heaved
him
out
he
dropped
the
handkerchief
out
of
his
hip
pocket
when
he
jumped
out
of
the
rig
it
right
simple
and
if
folks
did
get
to
wondering
about
it
it
be
safe
as
any
killing
can
be
as
safe
he
added
meaningly
as
dragging
fred
thurman
or
unhooking
brit
before
he
started
down
the
canyon
with
his
load
of
posts
swan
did
not
answer
but
turned
back
to
where
the
horse
had
been
left
tied
and
took
up
the
trail
from
there
as
before
the
dog
trotted
along
lone
riding
close
behind
him
and
swan
striding
after
they
did
not
really
need
the
dog
for
the
hoofprints
were
easily
followed
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
they
had
gone
perhaps
four
miles
when
lone
turned
resting
a
hand
on
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
while
he
looked
back
at
swan
you
see
where
he
was
headed
for
do
yuh
swan
he
asked
his
tone
as
friendly
as
though
he
was
not
under
arrest
as
a
murderer
if
he
did
go
to
whisper
eat
my
hat
you
the
man
to
know
swan
retorted
grimly
and
then
because
horse
had
slowed
in
a
long
climb
over
a
ridge
he
came
up
even
with
a
stirrup
lone
i
hate
to
do
it
i
like
you
if
you
do
kill
for
a
living
but
for
that
i
could
shoot
you
quick
as
a
coyote
smart
but
not
smart
enough
you
gave
yourself
away
when
i
showed
you
fred
saddle
after
that
i
knew
who
was
the
sawtooth
killer
that
i
came
here
to
find
you
thought
you
knew
lone
corrected
calmly
you
do
have
to
lie
swan
informed
him
bluntly
you
do
have
to
tell
anything
i
find
out
for
myself
if
i
make
mistake
go
to
it
lone
advised
him
coldly
it
do
make
a
darn
bit
of
difference
to
me
whether
i
ride
in
front
of
you
or
behind
i
so
glad
you
here
on
the
job
swan
that
i
plumb
willing
to
be
tied
hand
and
foot
if
it
help
you
any
when
a
man
too
damn
willing
to
be
my
prisoner
swan
observed
seriously
he
gets
tied
all
right
put
out
your
hands
lone
you
look
good
to
me
with
bracelets
on
when
you
talk
so
willing
to
go
to
jail
for
murder
he
had
slipped
the
rifle
butt
to
the
ground
and
before
lone
quite
realized
what
he
was
doing
swan
had
a
short
automatic
pistol
in
one
hand
and
a
pair
of
handcuffs
in
the
other
lone
flushed
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
hold
out
his
hands
chapter
sixteen
the
sawtooth
shows
its
hand
in
her
fictitious
west
lorraine
had
long
since
come
to
look
upon
violence
as
a
synonym
for
picturesqueness
murder
and
mystery
were
inevitably
an
accompaniment
of
chaps
and
spurs
but
when
a
man
she
had
cooked
breakfast
for
had
talked
with
just
a
few
hours
ago
lay
dead
in
the
she
forgot
that
it
was
merely
an
expected
incident
of
western
life
she
lay
in
her
bed
shaking
with
nervous
dread
and
the
shrill
rasping
of
the
crickets
and
was
unendurable
after
the
first
shock
had
passed
a
deep
fighting
rage
filled
her
made
her
long
for
day
so
that
she
might
fight
back
somehow
who
was
the
sawtooth
company
that
they
could
sweep
human
beings
from
their
path
so
ruthlessly
and
never
be
called
to
account
not
once
did
she
doubt
that
this
was
the
doing
of
the
sawtooth
another
carefully
planned
accident
calculated
to
rid
the
country
of
another
man
who
in
some
fashion
had
become
inimical
to
their
interests
from
lone
she
had
learned
a
good
deal
about
the
new
irrigation
project
which
lay
very
close
to
the
sawtooth
heart
she
could
see
how
the
quirt
ranch
with
its
water
rights
and
its
big
fertile
meadows
and
its
fences
and
silent
disapprobation
of
the
sawtooth
methods
might
be
looked
upon
as
an
obstacle
which
they
would
be
glad
to
remove
that
her
father
had
been
sent
down
that
grade
with
a
brake
deliberately
made
useless
was
a
horrible
thought
which
she
could
not
put
from
her
mind
she
had
thought
and
thought
until
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
knew
exactly
how
and
why
the
killer
plans
had
gone
awry
she
was
certain
that
she
and
swan
had
prevented
him
from
climbing
down
into
the
canyon
and
making
sure
that
her
dad
did
not
live
to
tell
what
mischance
had
overtaken
him
he
had
probably
been
watching
while
she
and
swan
made
that
stretcher
and
carried
her
dad
away
out
of
his
reach
he
would
not
shoot
he
would
not
dare
nor
would
he
dare
come
to
the
cabin
and
finish
the
job
he
had
begun
but
he
had
managed
to
kill
frank
poor
old
frank
who
would
never
grumble
and
argue
over
little
things
again
there
was
nothing
picturesque
nothing
adventurous
about
it
it
was
just
straight
tragedy
that
had
its
sordid
side
too
her
dad
was
a
querulous
sick
man
absorbed
by
his
sufferings
and
not
yet
out
of
danger
if
she
read
the
doctor
face
aright
jim
and
sorry
had
taken
orders
all
their
life
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
handle
the
ranch
work
alone
yet
how
else
would
it
be
done
there
was
lone
instinctively
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
him
for
comfort
lone
would
stay
and
help
and
somehow
it
would
be
managed
but
to
think
that
these
things
could
be
done
without
fear
of
retribution
jim
and
sorry
swan
and
lone
had
not
attempted
to
hide
their
belief
that
the
sawtooth
was
responsible
for
frank
death
yet
not
one
of
them
had
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
calling
the
sheriff
or
placing
the
blame
where
it
belonged
they
seemed
into
the
belief
that
it
would
be
useless
to
fight
back
they
seemed
to
look
upon
the
doings
of
the
sawtooth
as
an
act
of
providence
like
being
struck
by
lightning
or
freezing
to
death
as
men
sometimes
did
in
that
country
to
lorraine
that
passive
submission
was
the
most
intolerable
part
the
one
thing
she
could
not
would
not
endure
had
she
lived
all
of
her
life
on
the
quirt
she
probably
would
never
have
thought
of
fighting
back
and
would
have
accepted
conditions
just
as
her
dad
seemed
to
accept
them
but
her
mimic
west
had
taught
her
that
women
sometimes
dared
where
the
men
had
hesitated
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
should
submit
to
the
inevitable
just
because
the
men
appeared
to
do
so
wherefore
it
was
a
new
lorraine
who
rose
at
daybreak
and
silently
cooked
breakfast
for
the
men
learned
from
jim
that
sorry
was
not
back
from
echo
and
that
swan
and
lone
had
gone
down
to
the
place
where
frank
had
been
found
she
poured
jim
coffee
and
went
on
her
tiptoes
to
see
if
her
father
still
slept
she
dreaded
his
awakening
and
the
moment
when
she
must
tell
him
about
frank
and
she
had
an
unreasonable
hope
that
the
news
might
be
kept
from
him
until
the
doctor
came
again
brit
was
awake
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
frightened
lorraine
so
that
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
staring
at
him
fascinated
well
he
said
flatly
who
is
it
this
time
lone
or
frank
why
who
is
what
lorraine
parried
awkwardly
i
do
did
they
git
frank
las
night
brit
eyes
seemed
to
bore
into
her
soul
searching
pitilessly
for
the
truth
do
lie
to
me
raine
it
ai
going
to
help
any
was
it
frank
or
lone
they
a
dead
man
laid
out
on
this
ranch
who
is
it
lorraine
stammered
backing
away
from
him
did
you
know
how
did
it
happen
brit
eyes
were
terrible
lorraine
shuddered
while
she
told
him
rabbits
in
a
trap
brit
muttered
staring
at
the
low
ceiling
prove
nothing
could
convict
anybody
if
we
could
prove

to
your
mother
there

to
be

if

lorraine
stooped
over
him
and
her
eyes
were
almost
as
terrible
as
were
brit
let
it
pop
we
are
quitters
are
we
dad
i
going
to
stay
with
you
then
she
saw
tears
spilling
over
brit
eyelids
and
left
the
room
hurriedly
fighting
back
a
storm
of
weeping
she
herself
could
not
mourn
for
frank
with
any
sense
of
great
personal
loss
but
it
was
different
with
her
dad
he
and
frank
had
lived
together
for
so
many
years
that
his
loyal
heart
ached
with
grief
for
that
surly
faithful
old
partner
of
his
but
lorraine
fighting
blood
was
up
and
she
could
not
waste
time
in
weeping
she
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
went
out
and
called
jim
and
told
him
that
she
was
going
to
take
a
ride
and
that
she
wanted
a
decent
horse
you
can
take
mine
jim
offered
he
gentle
and
i
go
saddle
up
when
do
you
want
to
go
right
now
as
soon
as
i
ready
i
fix
dad
breakfast
and
you
can
look
after
him
until
lone
and
swan
come
back
one
of
them

stay
with
him
then
i
may
be
gone
for
three
or
four
hours
i
go
crazy
if
i
stay
here
any
longer
jim
eyed
her
while
he
bit
off
a
chew
of
tobacco
it
be
a
good
thing
if
you
had
some
neighbor
woman
come
in
and
stay
with
yuh
he
said
slowly
but
there
ai
any
i
can
think
of
that
be
much
force
you
take
snake
and
ride
around
close
and
forget
things
for
awhile
he
hesitated
his
hand
moving
slowly
back
to
his
pocket
if
yuh
feel
like
you
want
a
gun
lorraine
laughed
bitterly
you
do
think
any
accident
would
happen
to
do
you
well
no
er
i
would
advise
yuh
to
go
ridin
jim
said
thoughtfully
this
here
gun
kinda
techy
anyway
unless
you
used
to
a
quick
trigger
yuh
might
be
safer
without
it
than
with
it
by
the
time
she
was
ready
jim
was
tying
his
horse
snake
to
the
corral
lorraine
walked
slowly
past
the
with
her
face
turned
from
it
and
her
thoughts
dwelling
terrifiedly
upon
what
lay
within
once
she
was
past
she
began
running
as
if
she
were
trying
to
outrun
her
thoughts
jim
watched
her
gravely
untied
snake
and
stood
at
his
head
while
she
mounted
then
walked
ahead
of
her
to
the
gate
and
opened
it
for
her
yore
nerves
are
sure
shot
to
hell
he
blurted
sympathetically
as
she
rode
past
him
i
guess
you
need
a
ride
all
right
snake
plumb
safe
so
yuh
got
no
call
to
worry
about
him
take
it
easy
raine
on
the
worrying
that
about
the
worst
thing
you
can
do
lorraine
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
and
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
and
rode
up
the
trail
she
always
took
the
trail
where
she
had
met
lone
that
day
when
he
returned
her
purse
the
trail
that
led
to
fred
thurman
ranch
and
to
sugar
spring
and
if
you
took
a
certain
turn
at
a
certain
place
to
granite
ridge
and
beyond
up
on
the
ridge
nearest
the
house
al
woodruff
shifted
his
position
so
that
he
could
watch
her
go
he
had
been
watching
lone
and
swan
and
the
dog
trailing
certain
tracks
through
the
sagebrush
down
below
and
when
lorraine
rode
away
from
the
quirt
they
were
in
the
wagon
road
fussing
around
the
place
where
frank
had
been
found
they
ca
pin
nothing
on
al
tried
to
comfort
himself
if
that
damn
girl
would
keep
her
mouth
shut
i
could
stand
a
trial
even
they
ai
got
any
evidence
whatever
unless
she
saw
me
at
rock
city
that
night
he
turned
and
looked
again
toward
the
two
men
down
on
the
road
and
tilted
his
mouth
down
at
the
corners
in
a
sour
grin
go
to
it
and
be
damned
to
you
he
muttered
you
have
got
the
dope
and
you
ca
git
it
either
trail
that
horse
if
you
want
to
i
like
to
see
yuh
amuse
yourselves
that
way
he
turned
again
to
stare
after
lorraine
meditating
deeply
if
she
had
only
been
a
man
he
would
have
known
exactly
how
to
still
her
tongue
but
he
had
never
before
been
called
upon
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
keeping
a
woman
quiet
he
saw
that
she
was
taking
the
trail
toward
fred
thurman
and
that
she
was
riding
swiftly
as
if
she
had
some
errand
in
that
direction
something
urgent
al
was
very
adept
at
reading
moods
and
intentions
from
small
details
in
their
behavior
he
had
seen
lorraine
start
on
several
leisurely
purposeless
rides
and
her
changed
manner
held
a
significance
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
belittle
he
led
his
horse
down
the
side
of
the
ridge
opposite
the
road
and
the
house
mounted
there
and
rode
away
after
lorraine
keeping
parallel
with
the
trail
but
never
using
it
as
was
his
habit
he
made
no
attempt
to
overtake
her
and
not
once
did
lorraine
glimpse
him
or
suspect
that
she
was
being
followed
al
knew
well
the
art
of
concealing
his
movements
and
his
proximity
from
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
another
man
saddle
horse
and
snake
had
no
more
suspicion
than
his
rider
that
they
were
not
altogether
alone
that
morning
lorraine
sent
him
over
the
trail
at
a
pace
which
jim
had
long
since
reserved
for
emergencies
but
snake
appeared
perfectly
able
and
willing
to
hold
it
and
never
stumbled
or
slowed
unexpectedly
as
did
yellowjacket
wherefore
lorraine
rode
faster
than
she
would
have
done
had
she
known
more
about
horses
still
snake
held
his
own
better
than
even
jim
would
have
believed
and
carried
lorraine
up
over
granite
ridge
and
down
into
the
sawtooth
flat
almost
as
quickly
as
lorraine
expected
him
to
do
she
came
up
to
the
sawtooth
with
snake
in
a
lather
of
sweat
and
with
her
own
determination
unweakened
to
carry
the
war
into
the
camp
of
her
enemy
it
was
she
firmly
believed
what
should
have
been
done
long
ago
what
would
have
curbed
effectually
the
arrogant
powers
of
the
sawtooth
she
glanced
at
the
foreman
cottage
only
to
make
sure
that
hawkins
was
nowhere
in
sight
there
and
rode
on
toward
the
corrals
intercepting
hawkins
and
a
large
man
whom
she
knew
at
once
must
be
senator
warfield
himself
unconsciously
lorraine
mentally
fitted
herself
into
a
dramatic
movie
scene
and
plunged
straight
into
the
subject
there
has
been
she
said
tensely
another
sawtooth
accident
it
worked
better
than
the
last
one
when
my
father
was
sent
over
the
grade
into
spirit
canyon
frank
johnson
is
i
am
here
to
discover
what
you
are
going
to
do
about
it
her
eyes
were
flashing
her
chest
was
rising
and
falling
rapidly
when
she
had
finished
she
looked
straight
into
senator
warfield
face
her
own
full
in
the
sunlight
so
that
had
there
been
a
camera
shooting
the
scene
her
expression
would
have
been
fully
revealed
though
she
did
not
realize
all
that
senator
warfield
looked
her
over
calmly
just
as
a
director
would
have
wished
him
to
do
and
turned
to
hawkins
who
is
this
girl
he
asked
is
she
the
one
who
came
here
temporarily
deranged
she
the
girl
hawkins
affirmed
his
eyes
everywhere
but
on
lorraine
face
brit
hunter
daughter
they
say
they
i
his
daughter
how
dare
you
take
that
tone
hawkins
my
home
is
at
the
quirt
when
you
strike
at
the
quirt
you
strike
at
me
when
you
strike
at
me
i
am
going
to
strike
back
since
i
came
here
two
men
have
been
killed
and
my
father
has
been
nearly
killed
he
may
die
yet
i
do
know
what
effect
this
shock
will
have
upon
him
but
i
know
that
frank
is
dead
and
that
it
up
to
me
now
to
see
that
justice
is
done
you
you
cowards
you
will
kill
a
man
for
the
sake
of
a
few
dollars
but
you
kill
in
the
dark
you
cover
your
murders
under
the
pretense
of
accidents
i
want
to
tell
you
this
of
all
the
men
you
have
murdered
frank
johnson
will
be
avenged
you
are
going
to
answer
for
that
i
shall
see
that
you
answer
for
it
there
is
justice
in
this
country
there
be
i
going
to
demand
that
justice
shall
be
measured
out
to
you
i
was
she
violent
before
senator
warfield
asked
hawkins
in
an
undertone
which
lorraine
heard
distinctly
you
a
deputy
hawkins
if
this
keeps
on
i
afraid
you
will
have
to
take
her
in
and
have
her
committed
for
insanity
it
a
shame
poor
thing
at
her
age
it
is
pitiful
look
how
she
has
ridden
that
horse
another
mile
would
have
finished
him
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
i
crazy
what
an
idea
it
seems
to
me
senator
warfield
that
you
are
crazy
yourself
to
imagine
that
you
can
go
on
killing
people
and
thinking
you
will
never
have
to
pay
the
penalty
you
pay
there
is
law
in
this
land
even
if
this
is
pathetic
said
senator
warfield
still
speaking
to
hawkins
her
father
if
he
is
her
father
is
sick
and
not
able
to
take
care
of
her
we
have
to
assume
the
responsibility
ourselves
i
afraid
hawkins
she
may
harm
herself
or
lorraine
turned
white
she
had
never
seen
just
such
a
situation
arise
in
a
screen
story
but
she
knew
what
danger
might
lie
in
being
accused
of
insanity
while
warfield
was
speaking
she
had
a
swift
vision
of
the
evidence
they
could
bring
against
her
how
she
had
arrived
there
delirious
after
having
walked
out
from
echo
why
they
would
call
even
that
a
symptom
of
insanity
lone
had
warned
her
of
what
people
would
say
if
she
told
any
one
of
what
she
saw
in
rock
city
perhaps
really
believing
that
she
had
imagined
it
all
lone
might
even
think
that
she
had
some
mental
twist
her
world
was
reeling
around
her
she
whirled
snake
on
his
hind
feet
struck
him
sharply
with
the
quirt
and
was
galloping
back
over
the
trail
past
the
hawkins
house
before
senator
warfield
had
finished
advising
hawkins
she
saw
hawkins
standing
in
the
door
staring
at
her
but
she
did
not
stop
they
would
take
her
to
the
asylum
she
felt
that
the
sawtooth
had
the
power
that
she
had
played
directly
into
their
hands
and
that
they
would
be
as
ruthless
in
dealing
with
her
as
they
had
been
with
the
nesters
whom
they
had
killed
she
knew
it
she
had
read
it
in
the
inscrutable
level
look
of
senator
warfield
in
the
half
cringing
wholly
subservient
manner
of
hawkins
when
he
listened
to
his
master
they
fiends
she
cried
aloud
once
while
she
urged
snake
up
the
slope
of
granite
ridge
i
believe
they
kill
me
if
they
were
sure
they
could
get
away
with
it
but
they
could
frame
an
insanity
charge
and
put
me
my
god
what
fiends
they
are
at
the
sawtooth
senator
warfield
was
talking
with
hawkins
while
her
husband
saddled
two
horses
hawkins
lived
within
her
four
walls
and
called
that
her
spere
and
spoke
of
her
husband
as
he
you
know
the
type
of
woman
that
senator
warfield
was
anything
less
than
a
godlike
man
who
stood
very
high
on
the
ladder
of
fame
she
would
never
believe
so
she
related
garrulously
certain
incoherent
aimless
utterances
of
lorraine
and
cried
a
little
and
thought
it
was
perfectly
awful
that
a
sweet
pretty
girl
like
that
should
be
crazy
she
would
have
made
an
ideal
witness
against
lorraine
her
very
sympathy
carrying
conviction
of
lorraine
need
of
it
that
she
did
not
convince
senator
warfield
of
lorraine
mental
derangement
was
a
mere
detail
senator
warfield
had
reasons
for
knowing
that
lorraine
was
merely
afflicted
with
a
dangerous
amount
of
knowledge
and
was
using
it
without
discretion
you
must
let
her
run
loose
and
maybe
kill
herself
or
somebody
else
hawkins
exclaimed
oh
senator
it
awful
to
think
of
when
she
went
past
the
house
i
knew
the
poor
thing
was
right
we
overtake
her
senator
warfield
assured
her
comfortingly
she
ca
go
very
far
on
that
horse
she
ridden
him
half
to
death
getting
here
he
wo
hold
out
he
ca
she
came
here
i
suppose
because
she
had
been
here
before
a
sanitarium
may
be
able
to
restore
her
to
a
normal
condition
i
ca
believe
it
anything
more
than
some
nervous
disorder
now
do
worry
my
good
woman
just
have
a
room
ready
so
that
she
will
be
comfortable
here
until
we
can
get
her
to
a
sanitarium
it
is
hopeless
i
assure
you
but
i
mighty
glad
i
happened
to
be
here
so
that
i
can
take
charge
of
the
case
now
here
comes
hawkins
we
bring
her
back
do
you
worry
well
take
her
away
as
quick
as
you
can
senator
i
scared
of
crazy
people
his
brother
went
crazy
in
our
house
and
yes
yes
we
take
care
of
her
poor
girl
i
wish
that
i
had
been
here
when
she
first
came
said
the
senator
as
he
went
to
meet
hawkins
who
was
riding
up
from
the
corrals
leading
two
horses
one
for
lorraine
which
shows
what
was
his
opinion
of
snake
chapter
seventeen
yack
do
lie
for
a
time
the
trail
seemed
to
lead
toward
whisper
then
it
turned
away
and
seemed
about
to
end
abruptly
on
a
flat
outcropping
of
rock
two
miles
from
whisper
camp
lone
frowned
and
stared
at
the
ground
and
swan
spoke
sharply
to
jack
who
was
nosing
back
and
forth
at
fault
if
ever
a
dog
was
but
presently
he
took
up
the
scent
and
led
them
down
a
barren
slope
and
into
grassy
ground
where
a
bunch
of
horses
grazed
contentedly
jack
singled
out
one
and
ran
toward
it
silently
as
he
had
done
all
his
trailing
that
morning
the
horse
looked
up
stared
and
went
galloping
down
the
little
valley
stampeding
the
others
with
him
that
about
where
i
thought
we
wind
up
in
a
saddle
bunch
lone
observed
disgustedly
if
i
had
the
evidence
you
carrying
in
your
pocket
swan
i
put
that
darn
dog
on
the
scent
of
the
man
not
the
horse
the
man
i
got
swan
retorted
i
do
have
to
trail
him
well
now
you
you
got
him
here
good
level
ground
i
could
get
outa
sight
in
less
than
ten
minutes
afoot
let
me
walk
out
a
ways
and
you
see
if
that
handkerchief
mine
oh
search
me
all
you
want
to
first
he
added
when
he
read
the
suspicion
in
swan
eyes
make
yourself
safe
as
yuh
please
but
give
me
a
fair
show
you
made
up
your
mind
i
the
killer
and
you
been
fitting
the
evidence
to
me
or
trying
to
it
fits
swan
pointed
out
drily
you
see
if
it
does
the
dog
tell
you
all
about
it
in
about
two
minutes
if
you
give
him
a
chance
swan
looked
at
him
yack
do
lie
by
golly
i
raised
that
dog
to
trail
and
he
you
bet
he
cocker
spaniel
and
bloodhound
and
he
knows
things
that
dog
all
right
lone
you
walk
over
to
that
black
rock
and
set
down
if
you
think
you
frame
something
maybe
i
pack
a
dead
man
to
the
quirt
again
you
can
for
all
me
lone
replied
quietly
i
about
as
soon
go
that
way
as
the
way
i
am
now
swan
watched
him
until
he
was
seated
on
the
rock
as
directed
his
manacled
hands
resting
on
his
knees
his
face
turned
toward
the
horses
then
swan
took
the
blue
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
called
jack
to
him
and
muttered
something
in
swedish
while
the
dog
sniffed
at
the
cloth
find
him
yack
said
swan
standing
straight
again
jack
went
sniffing
obediently
in
wide
circles
crossing
unconcernedly
lone
footprints
while
he
trotted
back
and
forth
he
hesitated
once
on
the
trail
of
the
horse
he
had
followed
stopped
and
looked
at
swan
inquiringly
and
whined
swan
whistled
the
dog
to
him
with
a
peculiar
birdlike
note
and
called
to
lone
you
come
back
lone
and
let
yack
take
a
damn
good
smell
of
you
by
golly
if
that
dog
lies
to
me
this
time
i
lick
him
good
lone
came
back
grinning
a
little
all
right
now
maybe
you
listen
to
reason
i
ai
the
kind
to
tell
all
i
know
and
some
besides
swan
i
been
a
sawtooth
man
and
a
fellow
kinda
hates
to
throw
down
his
outfit
deliberate
but
they
going
too
strong
for
any
white
man
to
stand
for
i
quit
them
when
they
tried
to
get
brit
hunter
i
so
much
swan
but
i
pretty
good
at
guessing
so
if
come
with
me
to
whisper
your
dog
may
show
yuh
who
owns
that
handkerchief
if
he
do
then
i
making
a
mistake
and
i
like
to
be
set
right
somebody
rode
that
horse
swan
meditated
aloud
yack
do
make
a
mistake
like
that
and
i
do
think
i
blind
where
the
man
that
was
on
the
horse
what
you
think
lone
i
think
there
was
another
horse
somewhere
close
to
that
outcropping
tied
to
a
bush
maybe
i
think
the
man
you
after
changed
horses
there
just
on
a
chance
that
somebody
might
trail
him
from
the
road
you
put
your
dog
on
the
trail
of
that
one
particular
horse
and
he
showed
yuh
where
it
was
feeding
with
the
bunch
it
looks
to
me
like
it
was
turned
loose
back
there
and
come
on
alone
your
man
went
to
whisper
i
bank
money
on
that
anyway
your
dog
know
if
he
been
there
swan
thought
it
over
his
eyes
moving
here
and
there
to
every
hint
of
movement
between
the
skyline
and
himself
suddenly
he
turned
to
lone
his
face
flushing
with
honest
shame
loney
take
a
damn
swede
and
give
him
something
he
believes
and
you
could
pull
his
teeth
before
you
pull
that
notion
from
his
thick
head
you
acted
funny
that
day
fred
thurman
was
killed
and
you
gave
yourself
away
at
the
stable
when
i
showed
you
that
saddle
so
i
think
you
the
killer
and
i
keep
on
thinking
that
and
i
been
trying
to
catch
you
with
evidence
i
a
swede
all
right
square
head
built
of
wood
two
inches
thick
loney
you
kick
me
good
you
do
have
time
to
ride
over
here
get
some
other
horse
and
ride
back
to
the
quirt
after
frank
was
killed
you
got
there
before
i
did
last
night
we
know
frank
was
dead
not
much
more
than
one
hour
when
we
get
him
to
the
yack
he
gives
you
a
good
alibi
i
sure
am
glad
we
took
the
time
to
trail
that
horse
then
lone
remarked
while
swan
was
removing
the
handcuffs
you
all
right
swan
nothing
like
sticking
to
an
idea
till
you
know
it
wrong
now
let
stick
to
mine
for
awhile
let
go
on
to
whisper
it
ai
far
they
returned
to
the
rocky
hillside
where
the
trail
had
been
covered
and
searched
here
and
there
for
the
tracks
of
another
horse
found
the
trail
and
followed
it
easily
enough
to
whisper
swan
put
jack
once
more
on
the
scent
of
the
handkerchief
and
if
actions
meant
anything
jack
proved
conclusively
that
he
found
the
whisper
camp
reeking
with
the
scent
but
that
was
all
since
al
was
at
that
moment
trailing
lorraine
toward
the
sawtooth
we
may
as
well
eat
swan
suggested
we
get
him
by
golly
but
we
do
have
to
starve
ourselves
he
would
know
we
after
him
lone
agreed
he
stick
around
so
as
not
to
raise
suspicion
and
he
might
come
back
most
any
time
if
he
does
we
say
i
out
with
you
after
coyotes
and
we
stopped
here
for
a
meal
that
good
enough
to
satisfy
him
till
you
get
the
drop
on
him
but
i
want
to
tell
yuh
swan
you
ca
take
al
woodruff
as
easy
as
you
took
me
and
you
could
have
taken
me
so
easy
if
i
been
the
man
you
wanted
al
would
kill
you
as
easy
as
you
kill
coyotes
give
him
a
reason
and
you
wo
need
to
give
him
a
chance
along
with
it
find
the
chance
himself
because
they
thought
it
likely
that
al
would
soon
return
they
did
not
hurry
they
were
hungry
and
they
cooked
enough
food
for
four
men
and
ate
it
leisurely
jim
was
at
the
ranch
sorry
had
undoubtedly
returned
before
now
and
the
coroner
would
probably
not
arrive
before
noon
at
the
earliest
swan
wanted
to
take
al
woodruff
back
with
him
in
irons
he
wanted
to
confront
the
coroner
with
the
evidence
he
had
found
and
the
testimony
which
lone
could
give
there
had
been
too
many
killings
already
he
asserted
in
his
naïve
way
the
sooner
al
woodruff
was
locked
up
the
safer
the
country
would
be
he
discussed
with
lone
the
possibility
of
making
al
talk
the
chance
of
his
implicating
the
sawtooth
lone
did
not
hope
for
much
and
said
so
if
al
was
a
talker
he
would
be
holding
the
job
he
got
lone
argued
do
get
the
wrong
idea
again
swan
yuh
may
pin
this
on
to
al
but
that
wo
let
the
sawtooth
in
the
sawtooth
too
slick
for
that
they
be
more
likely
to
make
up
a
lynching
party
right
in
the
outfit
and
hang
al
as
an
example
than
they
would
try
to
shield
him
played
a
lone
hand
swan
right
from
the
start
unless
i
badly
mistaken
the
sawtooth
paid
him
for
playing
it
that
all
warfield
he
the
man
i
want
swan
confided
it
for
more
than
killing
these
men
it
goes
into
politics
loney
and
it
goes
deep
bad
for
the
government
getting
warfield
for
having
men
killed
is
getting
warfield
without
telling
secrets
of
politics
warfield
he
a
smart
man
by
golly
he
knows
some
one
is
after
him
in
politics
but
he
do
know
some
one
is
after
him
at
home
so
the
big
swede
has
got
to
be
smart
enough
to
get
the
evidence
against
him
for
killing
well
i
wish
yuh
luck
swan
but
i
ca
say
you
going
at
it
right
al
wo
talk
i
tell
yuh
swan
did
not
believe
that
he
waited
another
hour
and
made
a
mental
inventory
of
everything
in
camp
while
he
waited
then
chiefly
because
lone
impatience
finally
influenced
him
he
set
out
to
see
where
al
had
gone
according
to
jack
al
had
gone
to
the
corral
from
there
they
put
jack
on
the
freshest
hoofprints
leaving
the
place
and
were
led
here
and
there
in
an
apparently
aimless
journey
to
nowhere
until
after
jack
had
been
at
fault
in
another
rock
patch
the
trail
took
them
straight
away
to
the
ridge
overlooking
the
quirt
ranch
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
that
like
al
lone
commented
drily
coyotes
are
foolish
alongside
him
and
you
find
it
out
i
bet
he
been
watching
this
place
since
daybreak
where
he
goes
yack
will
follow
swan
grinned
cheerfully
and
i
follow
yack
we
get
him
lone
that
dog
he
never
quits
till
i
say
quit
you
better
go
down
and
get
a
horse
then
lone
advised
they
all
gentle
al
mounted
remember
he
maybe
gone
over
to
the
sawtooth
and
that
farther
than
you
can
walk
i
can
walk
all
day
and
all
night
when
i
need
to
go
like
that
i
can
take
short
cuts
that
a
horse
ca
take
i
think
i
shall
go
on
my
own
legs
well
i
going
down
to
the
house
first
i
know
them
two
men
riding
down
to
the
gate
i
want
to
see
what
the
boss
and
hawkins
have
got
to
say
about
this
last
better
come
on
down
swan
you
might
pick
up
something
they
heading
for
the
ranch
all
right
going
to
make
a
play
at
being
neighborly
i
reckon
you
bet
i
want
to
see
warfield
swan
assented
rather
eagerly
and
called
jack
who
had
nosed
around
the
spot
where
al
had
waited
so
long
and
was
now
trotting
along
the
ridge
on
the
next
lap
of
al
journey
they
reached
the
gate
in
time
to
meet
warfield
and
hawkins
face
to
face
hawkins
gave
lone
a
quick
questioning
look
and
nodded
carelessly
to
swan
warfield
having
a
delicate
errand
to
perform
and
knowing
how
much
depended
upon
first
impressions
pulled
up
eagerly
when
he
recognized
lone
has
the
girl
arrived
safely
lone
he
asked
anxiously
what
girl
lone
looked
at
him
noncommittally
miss
ah
hunter
have
you
been
away
all
the
forenoon
the
girl
came
to
the
ranch
in
such
a
condition
that
i
was
afraid
she
might
do
herself
or
some
one
else
an
injury
has
she
been
unbalanced
for
long
if
you
mean
lorraine
hunter
she
was
all
right
last
time
i
saw
her
and
that
was
last
night
lone
eyes
narrowed
a
little
as
he
watched
the
two
you
say
she
went
to
the
sawtooth
she
came
pelting
over
there
crazier
than
when
you
brought
her
in
hawkins
broke
in
gruffly
she
ai
safe
going
around
alone
like
that
senator
warfield
glanced
at
him
impatiently
is
there
any
truth
in
her
declaring
that
frank
johnson
is
dead
she
seemed
to
have
had
a
shock
of
some
kind
she
was
raving
crazy
and
in
her
rambling
talk
she
said
something
about
frank
johnson
having
died
last
night
lone
glanced
back
as
he
led
the
way
through
the
gate
which
swan
was
holding
open
he
did
die
he
got
killed
last
night
he
corrected
killed
and
how
did
that
happen
it
was
impossible
to
get
two
coherent
sentences
out
of
the
girl
senator
warfield
rode
through
just
behind
lone
and
reined
close
lowering
his
voice
no
use
in
letting
this
get
out
he
said
confidentially
it
may
be
that
the
girl
dementia
is
some
curable
nervous
disorder
and
you
know
what
an
injustice
it
would
be
if
it
became
noised
around
that
the
girl
is
crazy
how
much
english
does
that
swede
know
not
any
more
than
he
needs
to
get
along
on
lone
answered
instinctively
on
guard
he
all
right
just
a
kinda
cuss
that
would
harm
anybody
he
glanced
uneasily
at
the
house
hoping
that
lorraine
was
safe
inside
yet
fearing
that
she
would
not
be
safe
anywhere
sane
or
insane
she
was
in
danger
if
senator
warfield
considered
her
of
sufficient
importance
to
bring
him
out
on
horseback
to
the
quirt
ranch
lone
knew
how
seldom
the
owner
of
the
sawtooth
rode
on
horseback
since
he
had
cars
to
carry
him
in
soft
comfort
i
go
see
if
she
home
lone
explained
and
reined
john
doe
toward
the
house
i
go
with
you
senator
warfield
offered
suavely
and
kept
alongside
frank
johnson
was
killed
you
say
how
did
it
happen
fell
off
his
wagon
and
broke
his
neck
lone
told
him
laconically
brit
pretty
sick
yet
i
do
guess
you
better
go
inside
been
a
lot
of
excitement
already
for
the
old
man
he
only
sees
folks
he
used
to
having
around
with
that
he
dismounted
and
went
into
the
house
leaving
senator
warfield
without
an
excuse
for
following
swan
and
hawkins
came
up
and
waited
with
him
and
jim
opened
the
door
of
the
and
looked
out
at
them
without
showing
enough
interest
to
come
forward
and
speak
to
them
in
a
few
minutes
lone
returned
to
find
senator
warfield
trying
to
glean
information
from
swan
who
seemed
willing
enough
to
give
it
if
only
he
could
find
enough
english
words
to
form
a
complete
sentence
swan
then
had
availed
himself
of
lone
belittlement
of
him
and
was
living
down
to
it
but
lone
gave
him
scant
attention
just
then
she
has
come
back
brit
worked
himself
up
into
a
fever
and
i
did
dare
tell
him
she
was
with
me
i
said
she
all
tired
out
and
sick
and
wanted
to
stay
up
by
the
spring
awhile
where
it
cool
i
said
she
was
with
me
and
the
sun
was
too
much
for
her
and
she
sent
him
word
that
jim
would
take
care
of
him
awhile
longer
so
you
better
move
down
this
way
or
he
hear
us
talking
and
want
to
know
what
up
you
sure
she
is
here
senator
warfield
voice
held
suspicion
you
can
ask
jim
over
here
he
been
on
hand
right
along
and
if
you
ca
take
his
word
for
it
you
can
go
look
in
the
shack
but
in
that
case
brit
liable
to
take
a
shot
at
yuh
senator
he
on
the
warpath
right
and
he
got
his
gun
right
handy
it
is
not
necessary
to
search
the
cabin
senator
warfield
answered
stiffly
unless
she
is
in
a
stupor
we
have
heard
her
yelling
long
ago
the
girl
was
a
raving
maniac
when
she
appeared
at
the
sawtooth
it
for
her
good
that
i
thinking
jim
stepped
out
of
the
doorway
and
came
slowly
toward
them
eyeing
the
two
from
the
sawtooth
curiously
while
he
chewed
tobacco
his
hands
rested
on
his
hips
his
thumbs
hooked
inside
his
overalls
a
gawky
pose
that
fitted
well
his
colorless
personality
and
left
his
right
hand
close
to
his
comin
he
asked
nodding
at
the
two
who
were
almost
strangers
to
him
sorry
he
got
back
two
hours
ago
and
he
said
the
would
be
right
out
but
he
ai
showed
up
yet
senator
warfield
said
that
he
felt
sure
the
coroner
would
be
prompt
and
then
questioned
jim
artfully
about
miss
hunter
raine
she
went
fer
a
ride
i
loaned
her
my
horse
and
she
ai
back
yet
i
told
her
to
take
a
good
long
ride
and
settle
her
nerves
she
acted
kinda
edgy
senator
warfield
and
his
foreman
exchanged
glances
for
which
lone
could
have
killed
them
you
noticed
then
that
she
was
not
quite
herself
senator
warfield
used
his
friendly
confidential
tone
on
jim
yes
i
did
i
thought
a
ride
would
do
her
good
mebby
been
sticking
here
on
the
job
purty
close
and
frank
getting
killed
kinda
upset
her
i
guess
that
it
that
what
i
was
saying
disordered
nerves
which
rest
and
proper
medical
care
will
soon
remedy
he
looked
at
lone
her
horse
was
worn
out
when
she
reached
the
ranch
does
she
know
this
country
well
she
started
this
way
and
she
should
have
been
here
some
time
ago
we
thought
it
best
to
ride
after
her
but
there
was
some
delay
in
getting
started
hawkins
horse
broke
away
and
gave
us
some
trouble
catching
him
so
the
girl
had
quite
a
start
but
with
her
horse
fagged
as
it
was
we
had
no
idea
that
we
would
fail
to
get
even
a
sight
of
her
she
may
have
wandered
off
on
some
other
trail
in
which
case
her
life
as
well
as
her
reason
is
in
danger
lone
did
not
answer
at
once
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
senator
warfield
knew
where
lorraine
was
at
that
minute
and
that
he
might
be
showing
this
concern
for
the
effect
it
would
have
on
his
hearers
he
looked
at
him
speculatively
do
you
think
we
ought
to
get
out
and
hunt
for
her
he
asked
i
certainly
think
some
one
ought
to
we
ca
let
her
wander
around
the
country
in
that
condition
if
she
is
not
here
she
is
somewhere
in
the
hills
and
she
should
be
found
she
sure
ai
here
jim
asserted
convincingly
i
been
watching
for
the
last
two
hours
expecting
every
minute
she
show
up
i
a
been
kinda
oneasy
myself
but
snake
dead
gentle
and
she
a
purty
fair
rider
fer
a
girl
then
we
have
to
find
her
lone
can
you
come
and
help
the
swede
and
me
both
help
lone
volunteered
jim
and
sorry
can
wait
here
for
the
coroner
we
ought
to
find
her
without
any
trouble
much
swan
i
get
you
that
tobacco
first
and
see
if
brit
needs
anything
he
started
to
the
house
and
swan
followed
him
aimlessly
his
long
strides
bringing
him
close
to
lone
before
they
reached
the
door
what
do
you
make
of
this
new
play
lone
muttered
cautiously
when
he
saw
swan
shadow
move
close
to
his
own
by
golly
it
something
funny
about
it
you
stick
with
them
loney
and
find
out
i
taking
al
trail
with
yack
you
fix
it
and
he
added
whimsically
not
so
much
tobacco
lone
i
do
eat
it
or
smoke
it
ever
in
my
life
his
voice
was
very
swedish
which
was
fortunate
because
senator
warfield
appeared
softly
behind
him
and
went
into
the
house
swan
was
startled
but
he
had
much
time
to
worry
over
the
possibility
of
having
been
overheard
brit
voice
rose
in
a
furious
denunciation
of
bill
warfield
punctuated
by
two
shots
and
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
senator
my
god
the
whole
family
crazy
warfield
exclaimed
when
he
had
reached
the
safety
of
the
open
air
you
right
lone
i
thought
be
neighborly
enough
to
ask
what
i
could
do
for
him
and
he
tried
to
kill
me
lone
merely
grunted
and
gave
swan
the
tobacco
chapter
eighteen
i
think
al
woodruff
got
her
there
was
no
opportunity
for
further
conference
senator
warfield
showed
no
especial
interest
in
swan
and
the
swede
was
permitted
without
comment
to
take
his
dog
and
strike
off
up
the
ridge
jim
and
sorry
were
sent
to
look
after
brit
who
was
still
shouting
vain
threats
against
the
sawtooth
and
the
three
men
rode
away
together
warfield
did
not
suggest
separating
though
lone
expected
him
to
do
so
since
one
man
on
a
trail
was
as
good
as
three
in
a
search
of
this
kind
he
was
still
inclined
to
doubt
the
whole
story
he
did
not
believe
that
lorraine
had
been
to
the
sawtooth
or
that
she
had
raved
about
anything
she
had
probably
gone
off
by
herself
to
cry
and
to
worry
over
her
troubles
hurt
too
perhaps
because
lone
had
left
the
ranch
that
morning
without
a
word
with
her
first
he
believed
the
story
of
her
being
insane
had
been
carefully
planned
and
that
warfield
had
perhaps
ridden
over
in
the
hope
that
they
would
find
her
alone
though
with
frank
dead
on
the
ranch
that
would
be
unlikely
but
to
offset
that
lone
reason
told
him
that
warfield
had
probably
not
known
that
frank
was
dead
that
had
been
news
to
him
or
had
it
he
tried
to
remember
whether
warfield
had
mentioned
it
first
and
could
not
too
many
disturbing
emotions
had
held
him
lately
lone
was
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
a
long
quiet
pondering
over
his
problems
he
did
not
feel
sure
of
anything
except
the
fact
that
the
quirt
was
like
a
drowning
man
struggling
vainly
against
the
whirlpool
that
is
sucking
him
slowly
under
one
thing
he
knew
and
that
was
his
determination
to
stay
with
these
two
of
the
sawtooth
until
he
had
some
definite
information
until
he
saw
lorraine
or
knew
that
she
was
safe
from
them
like
a
weight
pressing
harder
and
harder
until
one
is
crushed
beneath
it
their
talk
of
lorraine
insanity
forced
fear
into
his
soul
they
could
do
just
what
they
had
talked
of
doing
he
himself
had
placed
that
weapon
in
their
hands
when
he
took
her
to
the
sawtooth
delirious
and
told
of
wilder
words
and
actions
hawkins
and
his
wife
would
swear
away
her
sanity
if
they
were
told
to
do
it
and
there
were
witnesses
in
plenty
who
had
heard
him
call
her
crazy
that
first
morning
they
could
do
it
they
could
have
her
committed
to
an
asylum
or
at
least
to
a
sanitarium
he
did
not
underestimate
the
influence
of
senator
warfield
and
what
could
the
quirt
do
to
prevent
the
outrage
frank
johnson
was
dead
brit
was
out
of
the
fight
for
the
time
being
jim
and
sorry
were
the
doggedly
faithful
sort
who
must
have
a
leader
before
they
can
be
counted
upon
to
do
much
swan
lone
lifted
his
head
and
glanced
toward
the
ridge
when
he
thought
of
swan
there
indeed
he
might
hope
for
help
but
swan
was
out
here
away
from
reinforcements
he
was
trailing
al
woodruff
and
when
he
found
him
that
might
be
the
end
of
swan
if
not
warfield
could
hurry
lorraine
away
before
swan
could
act
in
the
matter
a
whimsical
thought
of
swan
telepathic
miracle
crossed
his
mind
and
was
dismissed
as
an
unseemly
bit
of
foolery
in
a
matter
so
grave
as
lorraine
safety
and
yet
the
doctor
received
a
message
that
he
was
wanted
at
the
quirt
and
he
had
arrived
before
his
patient
there
was
no
getting
around
that
however
impossible
it
might
be
no
one
could
have
foreseen
brit
accident
no
one
save
the
man
who
had
prepared
it
for
him
and
he
would
be
the
last
person
to
call
for
help
we
followed
the
girl
almost
to
thurman
place
and
lost
the
trail
there
warfield
turned
in
the
saddle
to
look
at
lone
riding
behind
him
we
made
no
particular
effort
to
trace
her
from
there
because
we
were
sure
she
would
come
on
home
i
going
back
that
far
and
we
pick
up
the
trail
unless
we
find
her
at
the
ranch
she
may
have
hidden
herself
away
you
ca
he
added
be
sure
of
anything
where
a
demented
person
is
concerned
they
never
act
according
to
logic
or
reason
and
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
deductions
as
to
their
probable
movements
lone
nodded
not
daring
to
trust
his
tongue
with
speech
just
then
if
he
were
to
protect
lorraine
later
on
he
knew
that
he
must
not
defend
her
now
hawkins
told
me
she
had
some
sort
of
hallucination
that
she
had
seen
a
man
killed
at
rock
city
when
she
was
wandering
around
in
that
storm
warfield
went
on
in
a
careless
gossipy
tone
just
what
was
that
about
lone
you
the
one
who
found
her
and
took
her
in
to
the
ranch
i
believe
she
somehow
mixed
her
delusion
up
with
fred
thurman
she
lone
made
a
swift
decision
he
was
afraid
to
appear
to
hesitate
so
he
laughed
his
quiet
little
chuckle
while
he
scrambled
mentally
for
a
plausible
lie
i
do
know
as
she
done
that
quite
he
drawled
humorously
she
was
out
of
her
head
all
right
and
talking
wild
but
i
laid
it
to
her
being
sick
and
scared
she
said
a
man
was
shot
and
that
she
saw
it
happen
and
right
on
top
of
that
she
said
she
did
think
they
ought
to
stage
a
murder
and
a
thunderstorm
in
the
same
scene
and
thought
they
ought
to
save
the
thunder
and
lightning
for
the
murderer
to
make
his
getaway
by
she
used
to
work
for
the
moving
pictures
and
she
was
going
on
about
some
picture
she
thought
she
was
acting
a
part
in
afterwards
i
told
her
what
she
been
saying
and
she
seemed
to
kinda
remember
it
like
a
bad
dream
she
had
she
told
me
she
thought
the
villain
in
one
of
the
plays
she
acted
in
had
pulled
off
a
stage
murder
in
them
rocks
we
figured
it
out
together
that
the
first
crack
of
thunder
had
sounded
like
shooting
and
that
what
started
her
off
she
had
ever
been
in
a
real
thunderstorm
before
and
she
scared
of
them
i
know
that
one
we
had
the
other
day
like
to
of
scared
her
into
hysterics
i
laughed
at
her
and
joshed
her
out
of
it
did
she
ever
say
anything
about
fred
thurman
then
warfield
persisted
not
to
me
she
did
fred
was
dragged
that
night
and
if
she
heard
about
a
man
being
killed
during
that
same
storm
she
might
have
said
something
about
it
she
might
have
wondered
if
that
was
what
she
saw
i
do
know
she
pretty
sensible
when
she
ai
crazy
warfield
turned
his
horse
as
if
by
accident
so
that
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
lone
his
eyes
searched
lone
face
pitilessly
lone
you
know
how
ugly
a
story
can
grow
if
it
left
alone
do
believe
that
girl
actually
saw
a
man
shot
or
do
you
think
she
was
crazy
lone
met
warfield
eyes
fairly
i
think
she
was
plumb
out
of
her
head
he
answered
and
he
added
with
just
the
right
degree
of
hesitation
i
do
think
she
what
you
call
right
crazy
warfield
lots
of
folks
go
outa
their
heads
and
talk
crazy
when
they
get
a
touch
of
fever
and
they
get
over
it
again
let
have
a
fair
understanding
warfield
insisted
do
you
think
i
am
justified
in
the
course
i
am
taking
or
do
you
hunting
her
up
sure
i
do
if
you
and
hawkins
rode
on
home
i
keep
on
hunting
till
i
located
her
if
she
been
raving
around
like
you
say
she
in
no
shape
to
be
riding
these
hills
alone
she
got
to
be
taken
care
of
warfield
gave
him
another
sharp
scrutiny
and
rode
on
i
always
prefer
to
deal
in
the
open
with
every
one
he
averred
it
may
not
be
my
affair
strictly
speaking
the
quirt
and
the
sawtooth
are
very
intimate
but
the
quirt
having
trouble
enough
to
warrant
any
one
in
lending
a
hand
and
common
humanity
demands
that
i
take
charge
of
the
girl
until
she
is
herself
again
i
do
know
as
any
one
would
question
that
lone
assented
and
ground
his
teeth
afterwards
because
he
must
yield
even
the
appearance
of
approval
he
knew
that
warfield
must
feel
himself
in
rather
a
desperate
position
else
he
would
never
trouble
to
make
his
motives
so
clear
to
one
of
his
men
indeed
warfield
had
protested
his
unselfishness
in
the
matter
too
much
and
too
often
to
have
deceived
the
dullest
man
who
owned
the
slightest
suspicion
of
him
lone
could
have
smiled
at
the
sight
of
senator
warfield
betraying
himself
so
had
smiling
been
possible
to
him
then
he
dropped
behind
the
two
at
the
first
rough
bit
of
trail
and
felt
stealthily
to
test
the
hanging
of
his
which
he
might
need
in
a
hurry
those
two
men
would
never
lay
their
hands
on
lorraine
hunter
while
he
lived
to
prevent
it
he
did
not
swear
it
to
himself
he
had
no
need
they
rode
on
to
fred
thurman
ranch
dismounted
at
suggestion
which
amounted
to
a
command
and
began
a
careful
search
of
the
premises
if
warfield
had
felt
any
doubt
of
lone
loyalty
he
appeared
to
have
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
for
he
sent
lone
to
the
stable
to
search
there
while
he
and
hawkins
went
into
the
house
lone
guessed
that
the
two
felt
the
need
of
a
private
conference
after
their
visit
to
the
quirt
but
he
could
see
no
way
to
slip
unobserved
to
the
house
and
eavesdrop
so
he
looked
perfunctorily
through
all
the
sheds
and
around
the
depleted
haystacks
wherever
a
person
could
find
a
hiding
place
he
was
letting
himself
down
through
the
manhole
in
the
stable
loft
when
swan
voice
lowered
almost
to
a
whisper
startled
him
what
the
hell
lone
ejaculated
under
his
breath
i
thought
you
were
on
another
trail
that
trail
leads
here
lone
did
you
find
raine
yet
not
a
sign
of
her
swan
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
did
think
them
two
were
stalling
i
thought
they
either
had
seen
her
at
all
or
had
got
hold
of
her
and
were
trying
to
square
themselves
on
the
insanity
dodge
but
if
they
know
where
she
is
they
acting
damn
queer
swan
they
her
they
have
got
her
yet
they
in
the
house
swan
reassured
lone
i
heard
them
walking
you
do
think
they
got
her
there
lone
if
they
have
gritted
lone
they
made
the
biggest
blunder
of
their
lives
bringing
me
over
here
no
i
could
see
they
wanted
to
get
off
alone
and
hold
a
powwow
they
expected
she
be
at
the
quirt
i
think
al
woodruff
he
maybe
got
her
then
swan
declared
after
studying
the
matter
briefly
all
the
way
he
follows
the
trail
over
here
lone
i
could
see
you
sometimes
in
the
trail
he
was
keeping
hid
from
the
trail
i
think
because
raine
was
riding
along
this
morning
and
he
following
the
tracks
are
that
old
they
said
they
had
trailed
raine
this
far
coming
from
the
sawtooth
lone
told
him
worriedly
what
do
you
think
al
would
want
do
she
see
him
shoot
fred
thurman
by
golly
i
scared
for
that
girl
loney
lone
stared
at
him
he
would
dare
a
coward
is
a
brave
man
when
you
scare
him
bad
enough
swan
stated
flatly
i
careful
always
when
i
corner
a
coward
al
ai
a
coward
you
got
him
wrong
maybe
but
he
kills
like
a
coward
would
kill
and
he
scared
he
will
be
caught
warfield
he
scared
too
you
watch
him
lone
now
i
tell
you
what
i
do
yack
he
picks
up
the
trail
from
here
to
where
you
can
follow
easy
we
know
two
places
where
he
did
go
with
her
and
from
here
is
two
more
trails
he
could
take
but
one
goes
to
the
main
road
and
he
do
take
that
one
i
bet
you
i
think
he
takes
that
girl
up
spirit
canyon
maybe
it
woods
and
wild
country
in
a
few
miles
and
plenty
of
places
to
hide
and
good
chances
for
getting
out
over
the
top
of
the
divide
i
going
to
my
cabin
and
you
do
say
anything
when
i
leave
warfield
he
do
want
the
damn
swede
hanging
around
so
you
go
with
them
loney
this
is
to
what
you
call
a
we
want
the
dog
lone
told
him
but
swan
shook
his
head
hawkins
and
warfield
had
come
from
the
house
and
were
approaching
the
stable
swan
looked
at
lone
and
lone
went
forward
to
meet
them
the
swede
followed
along
on
the
ridge
and
he
did
see
anything
he
volunteered
before
warfield
could
question
him
we
might
put
his
dog
on
the
trail
and
see
which
way
she
went
from
here
warfield
thought
that
a
good
idea
he
was
so
sure
that
lorraine
must
be
somewhere
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
place
that
he
seemed
to
think
the
search
was
practically
over
when
jack
nosing
out
the
trail
of
al
woodruff
went
trotting
toward
spirit
canyon
took
the
wrong
turn
after
she
left
the
corrals
here
warfield
commented
relievedly
she
would
get
far
up
this
way
there
the
track
of
two
horses
hawkins
said
abruptly
that
there
is
the
girl
horse
all
right
there
a
hind
shoe
missing
we
saw
where
her
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
coming
over
juniper
ridge
but
another
horse
track
lone
bit
his
lip
it
was
the
other
horse
that
jack
had
been
trailing
so
long
there
was
a
loose
horse
hanging
around
thurman
place
he
said
casually
it
him
tagging
along
i
reckon
oh
said
hawkins
that
accounts
for
it
chapter
nineteen
swan
calls
for
help
past
the
field
where
the
horses
were
grazing
and
up
the
canyon
on
the
side
toward
skyline
meadow
that
lay
on
a
shoulder
of
bear
top
the
dog
nosed
unfalteringly
along
the
trail
now
and
then
he
was
balked
when
the
hoofprints
led
him
to
the
bank
of
granite
creek
but
not
for
long
jack
appeared
to
understand
why
his
trailing
was
interrupted
and
sniffed
the
bank
until
he
picked
up
the
scent
again
wonder
if
she
changed
off
and
rode
that
loose
horse
hawkins
said
once
when
the
tracks
were
plain
in
the
soft
soil
of
the
creek
bank
she
might
and
lead
that
horse
she
was
on
she
would
know
enough
she
a
city
girl
lone
replied
his
heart
heavy
with
fear
for
lorraine
well
she
ai
far
off
then
hawkins
comforted
himself
her
horse
acted
about
played
out
when
she
hit
the
ranch
she
had
him
wet
from
his
ears
to
his
tail
and
he
was
breathin
like
that
ford
at
the
ranch
if
that
a
sample
of
her
riding
she
ai
far
off
crazy
to
ride
up
here
keep
your
eyes
open
boys
we
must
find
her
whatever
we
do
warfield
gazed
apprehensively
at
the
rugged
steeps
on
either
hand
and
at
the
timber
line
above
them
from
here
on
she
could
turn
back
without
meeting
us
if
i
remember
this
country
correctly
could
she
hawkins
not
unless
she
turned
off
up
here
a
mile
or
two
into
that
gulch
that
heads
into
skyline
said
hawkins
there
a
stock
trail
part
way
down
from
the
top
where
it
swings
off
from
the
divide
to
wilder
creek
swan
walking
just
behind
hawkins
moved
up
a
pace
i
could
go
on
skyline
with
yack
and
i
could
come
down
by
those
trail
he
suggested
diffidently
swedishly
yet
with
a
certain
compelling
confidence
what
you
think
i
think
that
a
damned
good
idea
for
a
square
head
hawkins
told
him
and
repeated
it
to
warfield
who
was
riding
ahead
why
yes
we
do
need
the
dog
or
the
man
either
go
up
to
the
head
of
the
gulch
and
keep
your
eyes
open
swan
we
meet
you
up
here
you
know
the
girl
do
you
yas
ay
know
her
pretty
good
grinned
swan
well
do
frighten
her
do
let
her
see
that
you
think
anything
is
wrong
and
do
say
anything
about
us
we
made
the
mistake
of
discussing
her
condition
within
her
hearing
and
it
is
possible
that
she
understood
enough
of
what
we
were
saying
to
take
alarm
you
understand
do
tell
girl
she
crazy
he
tapped
his
head
to
make
his
meaning
plainer
do
tell
girl
we
looking
for
her
you
understand
yas
ay
know
english
pretty
good
ay
do
tell
too
moch
his
cheerful
smile
brought
a
faint
response
from
senator
warfield
at
lone
he
did
not
look
at
all
i
go
quick
i
good
climber
like
a
sheep
he
boasted
and
whistling
to
jack
he
began
working
his
way
up
a
rough
ledge
to
the
slope
above
lone
watched
him
miserably
wishing
that
swan
was
not
quite
so
matter
of
fact
in
his
if
al
woodruff
for
some
reason
which
lone
could
not
fathom
had
taken
lorraine
and
forced
her
to
go
with
him
into
the
wilderness
warfield
and
hawkins
would
be
his
allies
the
moment
they
came
up
with
him
lone
was
no
coward
but
neither
was
he
a
fool
hawkins
had
never
distinguished
himself
as
a
fighter
but
lone
had
gleaned
here
and
there
a
great
deal
of
information
about
senator
warfield
in
the
old
days
when
he
had
been
plain
bill
when
lorraine
and
al
were
overtaken
then
lone
would
need
to
show
the
stuff
that
was
in
him
he
only
hoped
he
would
have
time
and
that
luck
would
be
with
him
if
they
get
me
it
be
all
off
with
her
he
worried
as
he
followed
the
two
up
the
canyon
swan
would
have
been
a
help
but
he
thinks
more
of
catching
al
than
he
does
of
helping
raine
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
already
swan
was
halfway
up
the
canyon
steep
side
making
his
way
through
the
brush
with
more
speed
than
lone
could
have
shown
on
foot
in
the
open
unless
he
ran
the
sight
heartened
lone
a
little
swan
might
have
some
plan
of
his
own
an
ambush
possibly
if
he
would
only
keep
along
within
rifle
shot
and
remain
hidden
he
would
show
real
brains
lone
thought
but
swan
when
lone
looked
up
again
was
climbing
straight
away
from
the
little
searching
party
and
even
though
he
seemed
tireless
on
foot
he
could
not
perform
miracles
swan
however
was
not
troubling
himself
over
what
lone
would
think
or
even
what
warfield
was
thinking
contrary
to
lone
idea
of
him
swan
was
tired
and
he
was
thinking
a
great
deal
about
lorraine
and
very
little
about
al
woodruff
except
as
al
was
concerned
with
welfare
swan
had
made
a
mistake
and
he
was
humiliated
over
his
blunder
al
had
kept
himself
so
successfully
in
the
background
while
lone
peculiar
actions
had
held
his
attention
that
swan
had
never
considered
al
woodruff
as
the
killer
now
he
blamed
himself
for
death
he
had
been
watching
lone
had
been
baffled
by
lone
consistent
kindness
toward
the
quirt
by
the
force
of
his
personality
which
held
none
of
the
elements
of
murder
he
had
believed
that
he
had
the
sawtooth
killer
under
observation
and
he
had
been
watching
and
waiting
for
evidence
that
would
impress
a
grand
jury
and
all
the
while
he
had
let
al
woodruff
ride
free
and
unsuspected
the
one
stupid
thing
in
swan
opinion
which
he
had
not
done
was
to
let
lone
go
on
holding
his
tongue
he
had
forced
the
issue
that
morning
he
had
wanted
to
make
lone
talk
had
hoped
for
a
weakening
and
a
confession
instead
he
had
learned
a
good
deal
which
he
should
have
known
before
as
he
forged
up
the
slope
across
the
ridged
lip
of
the
canyon
his
one
immediate
object
was
speed
up
the
canyon
and
over
the
divide
on
the
west
shoulder
of
bear
top
was
a
trail
to
the
open
country
beyond
it
was
perfectly
passable
as
swan
knew
he
had
packed
in
by
that
trail
when
he
located
his
homestead
on
bear
top
that
is
why
he
had
his
cabin
up
and
was
living
in
it
before
the
sawtooth
discovered
his
presence
al
he
believed
was
making
for
bear
top
pass
once
down
the
other
side
he
would
find
friends
to
lend
him
fresh
horses
swan
had
learned
something
of
these
friends
of
the
sawtooth
and
he
could
guess
pretty
accurately
how
far
some
of
them
would
go
in
their
service
fresh
horses
for
al
food
perhaps
even
a
cabin
where
he
could
hide
lorraine
away
were
to
be
expected
from
any
one
of
them
once
al
was
over
the
divide
swan
glanced
up
at
the
sun
saw
that
it
was
dropping
to
late
afternoon
and
started
in
at
a
long
trot
across
the
mountain
meadow
called
skyline
a
few
pines
with
scattered
clumps
of
juniper
and
fir
dotted
the
long
irregular
stretch
of
grassland
which
formed
the
meadow
range
cattle
were
feeding
here
and
there
so
wild
they
lifted
heads
to
stare
at
the
man
and
dog
then
came
trotting
forward
their
curiosity
unabated
by
the
fact
that
they
had
seen
these
two
before
jack
looked
up
at
his
master
looked
at
the
cattle
and
took
his
place
at
swan
heels
swan
shouted
and
flung
his
arms
and
the
cattle
ducked
turned
and
galloped
awkwardly
away
swan
trot
did
not
slacken
his
rifle
swung
rhythmically
in
his
right
hand
the
muzzle
tilted
downward
beads
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
had
merged
into
tiny
rivulets
on
his
cheeks
and
dripped
off
his
square
jaw
still
he
ran
his
breath
unlabored
yet
coming
in
whispery
aspirations
from
his
great
lungs
the
full
length
of
skyline
meadow
he
ran
jumping
the
small
beginning
of
wilder
creek
with
one
great
leap
that
scarcely
interrupted
the
beautiful
rhythm
of
his
stride
at
the
far
end
of
the
clearing
snuggled
between
two
great
pines
that
reached
high
into
the
blue
his
squatty
cabin
showed
against
the
precipitous
shoulder
of
bear
top
peak
covered
thick
with
brush
and
scraggy
timber
whipped
incessantly
by
the
wind
that
blew
over
the
mountain
crest
at
the
door
swan
stopped
and
examined
the
crude
fastening
of
the
door
made
himself
certain
by
private
marks
of
his
own
that
none
had
entered
in
his
absence
and
went
in
with
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
it
was
still
broad
daylight
though
the
sun
rays
slanted
in
through
the
window
but
swan
lighted
a
lantern
that
hung
on
a
nail
behind
the
door
carried
it
across
the
neat
little
room
and
set
it
down
on
the
floor
beside
the
usual
pioneer
cupboard
made
simply
of
clean
boxes
nailed
bottom
against
the
wall
swan
had
furnished
a
few
extra
frills
to
his
cupboard
for
the
ends
of
the
boxes
were
fastened
to
hewn
slabs
standing
upright
and
just
clearing
the
floor
near
the
upper
shelf
a
row
of
nails
held
swan
coffee
cups
four
of
them
thick
and
white
such
as
cheap
restaurants
use
swan
hooked
a
finger
over
the
nail
that
held
a
cracked
cup
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
jack
sitting
in
the
doorway
with
his
keen
nose
to
the
world
you
watch
out
now
yack
i
shall
talk
to
my
mother
with
my
thoughts
he
said
drawing
a
hand
across
his
forehead
and
speaking
in
breathless
gasps
you
watch
for
answer
jack
thumped
his
tail
on
the
dirt
floor
and
sniffed
the
breeze
taking
in
his
overlapping
tongue
while
he
did
so
he
licked
his
lips
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
swan
and
draped
his
pink
tongue
down
over
his
lower
jaw
again
all
right
now
i
talk
said
swan
and
pulled
upon
the
nail
in
his
fingers
the
cupboard
swung
toward
him
bodily
end
slabs
and
all
he
picked
up
the
lantern
stepped
over
the
log
sill
and
pulled
the
cupboard
door
into
place
again
inside
the
dugout
swan
set
the
lantern
on
a
table
dropped
wearily
upon
a
rough
bench
before
it
and
looked
at
the
jars
beside
him
lifted
his
hand
and
opened
a
compact
but
thoroughly
efficient
field
wireless
set
his
right
fingers
dropped
to
the
key
and
the
whining
drone
of
the
wireless
rose
higher
and
higher
as
he
tuned
up
he
reached
for
his
receivers
ducked
his
head
and
adjusted
them
with
one
hand
and
sent
a
call
spitting
tiny
blue
sparks
from
the
key
under
his
fingers
he
waited
repeating
the
call
his
blue
eyes
clouded
with
anxiety
and
he
fumbled
the
adjustments
coaxing
the
current
into
perfect
action
before
he
called
again
answer
came
and
swan
bent
over
the
table
listening
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
opposite
wall
of
the
dugout
then
his
fingers
flexing
delicately
swiftly
he
sent
the
message
that
told
how
completely
his

urgent

swan
had
a
code
but
codes
require
a
little
time
in
the
composition
of
a
message
and
time
was
the
one
thing
he
could
not
waste
he
heard
the
gist
of
the
message
repeated
to
him
told
the
man
at
the
other
station
that
lives
were
at
stake
and
threw
off
the
current
chapter
twenty
kidnapped
lorraine
had
once
had
a
nasty
fall
from
riding
down
hill
at
a
gallop
she
remembered
that
accident
and
permitted
snake
to
descend
granite
ridge
at
a
walk
which
was
fortunate
since
it
gave
the
horse
a
chance
to
recover
a
little
from
the
strain
of
the
terrific
pace
at
which
she
had
ridden
him
that
morning
at
first
it
had
been
fighting
fury
that
had
impelled
her
to
hurry
now
it
was
fear
that
drove
her
homeward
where
lone
was
and
swan
and
that
stolid
faithful
jim
she
felt
that
senator
warfield
would
never
dare
to
carry
out
his
covert
threat
once
she
reached
home
nevertheless
the
threat
haunted
her
made
her
glance
often
over
her
shoulder
at
the
thurman
ranch
which
she
was
passing
with
a
sickening
memory
of
the
night
when
she
and
swan
had
carried
her
father
there
al
woodruff
rode
out
suddenly
from
behind
the
stable
and
blocked
the
trail
his
in
his
hand
his
face
stony
with
determination
lorraine
afterwards
decided
that
he
must
have
seen
or
heard
her
coming
down
the
ridge
and
had
waited
for
her
there
he
smiled
with
his
lips
when
she
pulled
up
snake
with
a
startled
look
you
in
such
a
hurry
this
morning
that
i
thought
the
only
way
to
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
was
to
hold
you
up
he
said
in
much
the
same
tone
he
had
used
that
day
at
the
ranch
i
do
see
why
you
want
to
talk
to
me
lorraine
retorted
not
in
the
least
frightened
at
the
gun
which
was
too
much
like
her
movie
west
to
impress
her
much
but
her
eyes
widened
at
the
look
in
his
face
and
she
tried
to
edge
away
from
him
without
seeming
to
do
so
al
stopped
her
by
the
simple
method
of
reaching
out
his
left
hand
and
catching
snake
by
the
of
the
bridle
you
do
have
to
see
why
he
said
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
you
lately
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
got
to
have
you
with
me
always
this
is
kinda
sudden
maybe
but
that
the
way
the
game
runs
sometimes
now
i
want
to
tell
yuh
one
or
two
things
that
for
your
own
good
one
is
that
i
have
my
way
or
die
getting
it
do
be
scared
i
wo
hurt
you
but
if
you
try
to
break
away
i
shoot
you
that
all
i
going
to
marry
you
see
first
then
i
make
love
to
you
afterwards
i
ai
asking
you
if
you
marry
me
you
going
to
do
it
or
i
kill
you
lorraine
gazed
at
him
fascinated
too
astonished
to
attempt
any
move
toward
escape
al
hand
slipped
from
the
bridle
down
to
the
reins
and
still
holding
snake
still
holding
the
gun
muzzle
toward
her
still
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
he
threw
his
right
leg
over
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
and
stepped
off
his
horse
put
your
other
hand
on
the
saddle
horn
he
directed
i
ai
going
to
hurt
you
if
you
good
he
twitched
his
neckerchief
off
lorraine
saw
that
it
was
untied
and
that
he
must
have
planned
all
this
and
with
it
he
tied
her
wrists
to
the
saddle
horn
she
gave
snake
a
kick
in
the
ribs
but
al
checked
the
horse
first
start
and
snake
was
too
tired
to
dispute
a
command
to
stand
still
al
put
up
his
gun
pulled
a
hunting
knife
from
a
little
scabbard
in
his
boot
sliced
two
pairs
of
saddle
strings
from
saddle
calmly
caught
and
held
her
foot
when
she
tried
to
kick
him
pushed
the
foot
back
into
the
stirrup
and
tied
it
there
with
one
of
the
leather
strings
just
as
if
he
were
engaged
in
an
everyday
proceeding
he
walked
around
snake
and
tied
lorraine
right
foot
then
to
prevent
her
from
foolishly
throwing
herself
from
the
horse
and
getting
hurt
he
tied
the
stirrups
together
under
the
horse
belly
now
if
you
be
a
good
girl
i
untie
your
hands
he
said
glancing
up
into
her
face
he
freed
her
hands
and
lorraine
immediately
slapped
him
in
the
face
and
reached
for
his
gun
but
al
was
too
quick
for
her
he
stepped
back
picked
up
snake
reins
and
mounted
his
own
horse
he
looked
back
at
her
appraisingly
saw
her
glare
of
hatred
and
grinned
at
it
while
he
touched
his
horse
with
the
spurs
and
rode
away
leading
snake
behind
him
lorraine
said
nothing
until
al
riding
at
a
lope
passed
the
field
at
the
mouth
of
spirit
canyon
where
the
roan
still
fed
with
the
others
they
were
feeding
along
the
creek
quite
close
to
the
fence
and
the
roan
walked
toward
them
the
sight
of
it
stirred
lorraine
out
of
her
dumb
horror
you
killed
fred
thurman
i
saw
you
she
cried
suddenly
well
you
ai
going
to
holler
it
all
over
the
country
al
flung
back
at
her
over
his
shoulder
when
you
married
to
me
you
come
mighty
close
to
keeping
your
mouth
shut
about
it
i
never
marry
you
you
you
fiend
do
you
think
i
marry
a
murderer
like
you
al
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
at
her
intently
if
i
all
that
he
told
her
coolly
you
can
figure
out
about
what
happen
to
you
if
you
marry
me
if
you
saw
what
i
done
to
fred
thurman
what
do
you
reckon
i
do
to
he
looked
at
her
for
a
minute
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
rode
on
crossing
the
creek
and
taking
a
trail
which
lorraine
did
not
know
much
of
the
time
they
traveled
in
the
water
though
it
slowed
their
pace
where
the
trail
was
rocky
they
took
it
and
made
better
time
snake
lagged
a
little
on
the
upgrades
but
he
was
well
trained
to
lead
and
gave
little
trouble
lorraine
thought
longingly
of
yellowjacket
and
his
stubbornness
and
tried
to
devise
some
way
of
escape
she
could
not
believe
that
fate
would
permit
al
woodruff
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
lone
would
overtake
them
perhaps
and
then
she
remembered
that
lone
would
have
no
means
of
knowing
which
way
she
had
gone
if
hawkins
and
senator
warfield
came
after
them
her
plight
would
be
worse
than
ever
still
she
decided
that
she
must
risk
that
danger
and
give
lone
a
clue
she
dropped
a
glove
beside
the
trail
where
it
lay
in
plain
sight
of
any
one
following
them
but
presently
al
looked
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
one
of
her
hands
was
bare
and
tied
snake
reins
to
his
saddle
and
his
own
horse
to
a
bush
then
he
went
back
down
the
trail
until
he
found
the
glove
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
came
silently
up
to
lorraine
and
pulled
off
her
other
glove
without
a
word
he
took
her
wrists
in
a
firm
clasp
tied
them
together
again
to
the
saddle
horn
pulled
off
her
tie
her
hat
and
the
pins
from
her
hair
i
guess
you
do
know
me
yet
he
remarked
dryly
when
he
had
confiscated
every
small
article
which
she
could
let
fall
as
she
rode
i
was
trying
to
treat
yuh
white
but
you
do
seem
to
appreciate
it
now
you
can
ride
hobbled
young
lady
oh
i
could
you
lorraine
whispered
between
set
teeth
you
mean
you
like
to
well
i
ai
going
to
give
you
a
chance
his
eyes
rested
on
her
face
with
a
new
expression
an
awakening
desire
for
her
an
admiration
for
the
spirit
that
would
not
let
her
weep
and
plead
with
him
say
you
ai
going
to
be
a
bit
hard
to
marry
he
observed
his
eyes
lighting
with
what
was
probably
his
nearest
approach
to
tenderness
i
kinda
wish
you
liked
me
now
i
got
you
he
shook
her
arm
and
laughed
when
she
turned
her
face
away
from
him
then
remounted
his
horse
snake
moved
reluctantly
when
al
started
on
lorraine
felt
hope
slipping
from
her
with
her
hands
tied
she
could
do
nothing
at
all
save
sit
there
and
ride
wherever
al
woodruff
chose
to
lead
her
horse
he
seemed
to
be
making
for
the
head
of
spirit
canyon
on
the
side
toward
bear
top
as
they
climbed
higher
she
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
road
down
which
her
father
had
driven
almost
to
his
death
she
studied
al
back
as
he
rode
before
her
and
wondered
if
he
could
really
be
enough
to
kill
without
compunction
whoever
he
was
told
to
kill
whether
he
had
any
personal
quarrel
with
his
victim
or
not
certainly
he
had
had
no
quarrel
with
her
father
or
with
frank
it
was
long
past
noon
and
she
was
terribly
hungry
and
very
thirsty
but
she
would
not
tell
al
her
wants
if
she
starved
she
tried
to
guess
at
his
plans
and
at
his
motive
for
taking
her
away
like
this
he
had
no
camping
outfit
a
bulkily
rolled
slicker
forming
his
only
burden
he
could
not
then
be
planning
to
take
her
much
farther
into
the
wilderness
yet
if
he
did
not
hide
her
away
how
could
he
expect
to
keep
her
his
motive
for
marrying
her
was
rather
mystifying
he
did
not
seem
sufficiently
in
love
with
her
to
warrant
an
abduction
and
he
was
too
cool
for
such
a
headlong
action
unless
driven
by
necessity
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
about
as
he
rode
not
about
her
she
guessed
except
when
some
bad
place
in
the
trail
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
stop
tie
snake
to
the
nearest
bush
lead
his
own
horse
past
the
obstruction
and
come
back
after
her
several
times
this
was
necessary
once
he
took
the
time
to
examine
the
thongs
on
her
ankles
apparently
wishing
to
make
sure
that
she
was
not
uncomfortable
once
he
looked
up
into
her
sullenly
distressed
face
and
said
tired
in
a
humanly
sympathetic
tone
that
made
her
blink
back
the
tears
she
shook
her
head
and
would
not
look
at
him
al
regarded
her
in
silence
for
a
minute
led
snake
to
his
own
horse
mounted
and
rode
on
he
was
a
murderer
he
had
undoubtedly
killed
many
men
he
would
kill
her
if
she
attempted
to
escape
and
he
could
not
catch
me
lorraine
was
just
enough
to
add
yet
she
felt
baffled
cheated
of
the
full
horror
of
being
kidnapped
she
had
no
knowledge
of
a
bad
man
who
was
human
in
spots
without
being
repentant
for
love
of
a
girl
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
the
worst
outlaw
would
weep
over
his
past
misdeeds
straighten
his
shoulders
look
to
heaven
for
help
and
become
a
hero
for
whom
audiences
might
be
counted
upon
to
shed
furtive
tears
al
woodruff
however
did
not
love
her
his
eyes
had
once
or
twice
softened
to
friendliness
but
love
was
not
there
neither
was
repentance
there
he
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
himself
quite
ready
to
commit
further
crimes
for
sake
of
his
own
safety
or
desire
he
was
hard
she
decided
but
he
was
not
unnecessarily
harsh
cruel
without
being
wantonly
brutal
he
was
in
short
the
strangest
man
she
had
ever
seen
chapter
oh
i
could
kill
you
before
sundown
they
reached
the
timberland
on
bear
top
the
horses
slipped
on
the
pine
needles
when
al
left
the
trail
and
rode
up
a
gentle
incline
where
the
trees
grew
large
and
there
was
little
underbrush
it
was
very
beautiful
with
the
slanting
painting
broad
yellow
bars
across
the
gloom
of
the
forest
in
a
little
while
they
reached
the
crest
of
that
slope
and
lorraine
looking
back
could
only
guess
at
where
the
trail
wound
on
among
the
trees
lower
down
birds
called
companionably
from
the
high
branches
above
them
a
nesting
grouse
flew
chuttering
out
from
under
a
juniper
bush
alighted
a
short
distance
away
and
went
limping
and
dragging
one
wing
before
them
cheeping
piteously
while
lorraine
was
wondering
if
the
poor
thing
had
hurt
a
leg
in
lighting
al
clipped
its
head
off
neatly
with
a
bullet
from
his
though
lorraine
had
not
seen
him
pull
the
gun
and
did
not
know
he
meant
to
shoot
the
bird
mate
whirred
up
and
away
through
the
trees
and
lorraine
was
glad
that
it
had
escaped
al
slid
the
gun
back
into
his
holster
leaned
from
his
saddle
and
picked
up
the
dead
grouse
as
unconcernedly
as
he
would
have
dismounted
pulled
his
knife
from
his
boot
and
drew
the
bird
neatly
flinging
the
crop
and
entrails
from
him
them
juniper
berries
tastes
the
meat
if
you
do
clean
out
right
away
he
remarked
casually
to
lorraine
as
he
wiped
the
knife
on
his
trousers
and
thrust
it
back
into
the
before
he
tied
the
grouse
to
the
saddle
by
its
blue
scaley
little
feet
when
he
was
ready
to
go
on
snake
refused
to
budge
tough
as
he
was
he
had
at
last
reached
the
limit
of
his
energy
and
ambition
al
yanked
hard
on
the
bridle
reins
then
rode
back
and
struck
him
sharply
with
his
quirt
before
snake
would
rouse
himself
enough
to
move
forward
he
went
stiffly
reluctantly
pulling
back
until
his
head
was
held
straight
out
before
him
al
dragged
him
so
for
a
rod
or
two
lost
patience
and
returned
to
whip
him
forward
again
what
a
brute
you
are
lorraine
exclaimed
indignantly
ca
you
see
now
tired
he
is
al
glanced
at
her
from
under
his
eyebrows
he
all
in
but
he
got
to
make
it
he
said
i
been
that
way
myself
and
made
it
what
i
can
do
a
horse
can
do
come
on
you
bonehead
snake
went
on
urged
now
and
then
by
al
quirt
every
blow
made
lorraine
wince
and
she
made
the
wincing
perfectly
apparent
to
al
in
the
hope
that
he
would
take
some
notice
of
it
and
give
her
a
chance
to
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
him
without
opening
the
conversation
herself
but
al
did
not
say
anything
when
the
time
came
as
even
lorraine
saw
that
it
must
when
snake
refused
to
attempt
a
steep
slope
al
still
said
nothing
he
untied
her
ankles
from
the
stirrups
and
her
hands
from
the
saddle
horn
carried
her
in
his
arms
to
his
own
horse
and
compelled
her
to
mount
then
he
retied
her
exactly
as
she
had
been
tied
on
snake
skinner
knows
this
trail
he
told
lorraine
and
i
behind
yuh
with
a
gun
do
forget
that
miss
spitfire
you
let
skinner
go
to
suit
himself
and
if
he
goes
wrong
you
pay
because
it
be
you
reining
him
wrong
get
along
there
skinner
skinner
got
along
in
a
businesslike
way
that
told
why
al
woodruff
had
chosen
to
ride
him
on
this
trip
he
seemed
to
be
a
perfectly
dependable
saddle
horse
for
a
bandit
to
own
he
wound
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
boulders
stepping
carefully
over
fallen
logs
he
thrust
his
nose
out
straight
and
laid
back
his
ears
and
pushed
his
way
through
thickets
of
young
pines
he
went
circumspectly
along
the
edge
of
a
deep
gulch
climbed
over
a
ridge
and
worked
his
way
down
the
precipitous
slope
on
the
farther
side
made
his
way
around
a
thick
clump
of
spruces
and
stopped
in
a
little
grassy
glade
no
bigger
than
a
city
lot
but
with
a
spring
gurgling
somewhere
near
then
he
swung
his
head
around
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
inquiringly
at
al
who
was
coming
behind
leading
snake
lorraine
looked
at
him
also
but
al
did
not
say
anything
to
her
or
to
the
horse
he
let
them
stand
there
and
wait
while
he
unsaddled
snake
put
a
drag
rope
on
him
and
led
him
to
the
best
grazing
then
coming
back
he
very
untied
lorraine
and
helped
her
off
the
horse
lorraine
was
all
prepared
to
fight
but
she
did
not
quite
know
how
to
struggle
with
a
man
who
did
not
take
hold
of
her
or
touch
her
except
to
steady
her
in
dismounting
unconsciously
she
waited
for
a
cue
and
the
cue
was
not
given
al
mind
seemed
intent
upon
making
skinner
comfortable
still
he
kept
an
eye
on
lorraine
and
he
did
not
turn
his
back
to
her
lorraine
looked
over
to
where
snake
too
exhausted
to
eat
stood
with
drooping
head
and
all
four
legs
braced
like
sticks
under
him
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
not
even
her
old
director
would
order
her
to
make
a
run
for
that
horse
and
try
to
get
away
on
him
snake
looked
as
if
he
would
never
move
from
that
position
until
he
toppled
over
al
pulled
the
bridle
off
skinner
gave
him
a
slap
on
the
rump
and
watched
him
go
off
switching
his
tail
and
nosing
the
ground
for
a
likable
place
to
roll
al
glance
went
on
to
snake
and
from
him
to
lorraine
you
sure
do
know
how
to
ride
hell
out
of
a
horse
he
remarked
now
he
be
stiff
and
sore
and
we
got
quite
a
ride
to
make
his
tone
of
disapproval
sent
a
guilty
feeling
through
lorraine
until
she
remembered
that
a
slow
horse
might
save
her
from
this
man
who
was
all
bad
except
perhaps
just
on
the
surface
which
was
not
altogether
repellent
she
looked
around
at
the
tiny
basin
set
like
a
saucer
among
the
pines
already
the
dusk
was
painting
deep
shadows
in
the
woods
across
the
opening
and
turning
the
sky
a
darker
blue
skinner
rolled
over
twice
got
up
and
shook
himself
with
a
satisfied
snort
and
went
away
to
feed
she
might
if
she
were
patient
run
to
the
horse
when
back
was
turned
she
thought
once
in
the
woods
she
might
have
some
chance
of
eluding
him
and
perhaps
skinner
would
show
as
much
wisdom
going
as
he
had
in
coming
and
take
her
down
to
the
sageland
but
skinner
walked
to
the
farther
edge
of
the
meadow
before
he
stopped
and
al
woodruff
never
turned
his
back
to
a
foe
an
owl
hooted
unexpectedly
and
lorraine
edged
closer
to
her
captor
who
was
gathering
dead
branches
one
by
one
and
throwing
them
toward
a
certain
spot
which
he
had
evidently
selected
for
a
campfire
he
looked
at
her
keenly
even
suspiciously
and
pointed
with
the
stick
in
his
left
hand
you
might
go
over
there
by
the
saddle
and
set
down
till
i
get
a
fire
going
he
said
do
go
wandering
around
aimless
like
a
hen
turkey
watching
a
chance
to
duck
into
the
brush
there
bear
in
there
and
lion
and
lynx
and
i
hate
to
see
you
chawed
they
never
clean
their
and
blood
poison
generally
sets
in
where
they
leave
a
scratch
go
and
set
down
lorraine
did
not
know
how
much
of
his
talk
was
truth
but
she
went
and
sat
down
by
his
saddle
and
began
braiding
her
hair
in
two
tight
braids
like
a
squaw
if
she
did
get
a
chance
to
run
she
thought
she
did
not
want
her
hair
flying
loose
to
catch
on
bushes
and
briars
she
had
once
fled
through
a
brush
patch
in
griffith
park
with
her
hair
flowing
loose
and
she
had
not
liked
the
experience
though
it
had
looked
very
nice
on
the
screen
before
she
had
finished
the
braiding
al
came
over
to
the
saddle
and
untied
his
slicker
roll
and
the
grouse
come
on
over
to
the
fire
he
said
i
learn
yuh
a
trick
or
two
about
camp
cooking
if
i
goin
to
keep
yuh
with
me
you
might
just
as
well
learn
how
to
cook
we
be
on
the
trail
the
biggest
part
of
our
time
i
expect
he
took
her
by
the
arm
just
as
any
man
might
have
done
and
led
her
to
the
fire
that
was
beginning
to
crackle
cheerfully
he
set
her
down
on
the
side
where
the
smoke
would
be
least
likely
to
blow
her
way
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
grouse
stripping
off
skin
and
feathers
together
he
unrolled
the
slicker
and
laid
out
a
piece
of
bacon
a
package
of
coffee
a
small
coffeepot
bannock
and
salt
the
coffeepot
and
the
grouse
he
took
in
one
hand
his
left
lorraine
observed
and
started
toward
the
spring
which
she
could
hear
gurgling
in
the
shadows
amongst
the
trees
lorraine
watched
him
sidelong
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
now
that
she
would
stay
where
she
was
the
woods
were
dark
the
firelight
and
the
warmth
enticed
her
the
sight
of
the
supper
preparations
made
her
hungrier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
before
when
one
has
breakfasted
on
one
cup
of
coffee
at
dawn
and
has
ridden
all
day
with
nothing
to
eat
running
away
from
food
even
though
that
food
is
in
the
hands
of
one
captor
requires
courage
lorraine
was
terribly
tempted
to
stay
at
least
until
she
had
eaten
but
al
might
not
give
her
another
chance
like
this
she
crept
on
her
knees
to
the
slicker
and
seized
one
piece
of
bannock
crawled
out
of
the
firelight
stealthily
then
sprang
to
her
feet
and
began
running
straight
across
the
meadow
toward
skinner
twenty
yards
she
covered
when
a
bullet
sang
over
her
head
lorraine
ducked
stumbled
and
fell
headfirst
over
a
hummock
not
quite
sure
that
she
had
not
been
shot
thought
maybe
i
could
trust
yuh
to
play
square
al
said
disgustedly
pulling
her
to
her
feet
the
gun
still
smoking
in
his
hands
you
little
fool
what
do
you
think
you
do
in
these
hills
alone
you
sure
enough
belittle
me
if
you
think
you
have
a
chance
in
a
million
of
getting
away
from
me
she
fought
him
then
with
a
great
inner
relief
that
the
situation
was
at
last
swinging
around
to
a
normal
kidnapping
still
al
woodruff
seemed
unable
to
play
his
part
realistically
he
failed
to
fill
her
with
fear
and
repulsion
she
had
to
think
back
to
remember
that
he
had
killed
men
in
order
to
realize
her
own
danger
now
for
instance
he
merely
forced
her
back
to
the
campfire
pulled
the
saddle
strings
from
his
pocket
and
tied
her
feet
together
using
a
complicated
knot
which
he
told
her
she
might
work
on
all
she
darn
pleased
for
all
he
cared
then
he
went
calmly
to
work
cooking
their
supper
this
was
simple
he
divided
the
grouse
so
that
one
part
had
the
meaty
breast
and
legs
and
the
other
the
back
and
wings
the
meaty
part
he
larded
neatly
with
strips
of
bacon
using
his
hunting
knife
which
lorraine
watched
fascinatedly
wondering
if
it
had
ever
taken
the
life
of
a
man
he
skewered
the
meat
on
a
green
forked
stick
and
gave
it
to
her
to
broil
for
herself
over
the
hottest
coals
of
the
fire
while
he
made
the
coffee
and
prepared
his
own
portion
of
the
grouse
lorraine
was
hungry
she
broiled
the
grouse
carefully
and
ate
it
with
the
exception
of
one
leg
which
she
surprised
herself
by
offering
to
al
who
was
picking
the
bones
of
his
own
share
down
to
the
last
shred
of
meat
she
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
black
and
returned
the
cup
to
the
killer
who
unconcernedly
drank
from
it
without
any
previous
rinsing
she
ate
bannock
with
her
meat
and
secretly
thought
what
an
adventure
it
would
be
if
only
it
were
not
real
if
only
she
were
not
threatened
with
a
forced
marriage
to
this
man
the
primitive
camp
appealed
to
her
she
who
had
prided
herself
upon
being
an
outdoor
girl
saw
how
she
had
always
played
at
being
primitive
this
was
real
she
would
have
loved
it
if
only
the
man
opposite
were
lone
or
swan
or
some
one
else
whom
she
knew
and
trusted
she
watched
the
firelight
dancing
on
al
somber
face
softening
its
hardness
making
it
almost
wistful
when
he
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
coals
she
thrilled
when
she
saw
how
watchful
he
was
how
he
lifted
his
head
and
listened
to
every
little
night
sound
she
was
afraid
of
him
as
she
feared
the
lightning
she
feared
his
pitiless
attitude
toward
human
life
she
would
find
some
way
to
outwit
him
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
marrying
him
she
thought
she
would
escape
him
if
she
could
without
too
great
a
risk
of
being
shot
she
felt
absolutely
certain
that
he
would
shoot
her
with
as
little
compunction
as
he
would
marry
her
by
force
and
it
seemed
to
lorraine
that
he
would
not
greatly
care
which
he
did
i
guess
you
tired
al
said
suddenly
rousing
himself
from
deep
study
and
looking
at
her
imperturbably
i
fix
yuh
so
you
can
sleep
and
that
about
all
yuh
can
do
he
went
over
to
his
saddle
took
the
blanket
and
unfolded
it
until
lorraine
saw
that
it
was
a
bed
blanket
of
heavy
gray
wool
the
man
ingenuity
seemed
endless
without
seeming
to
have
any
extra
luggage
he
had
nevertheless
carried
a
very
efficient
camp
outfit
with
him
he
took
his
hunting
knife
went
to
the
spruce
grove
and
cut
many
small
green
branches
returning
with
all
he
could
hold
in
his
arms
she
watched
him
lay
them
tips
up
for
a
mattress
and
was
secretly
glad
that
she
knew
this
much
at
least
of
camp
comfort
he
spread
the
blanket
over
them
and
then
without
a
word
came
over
to
her
and
untied
her
feet
go
and
lay
down
on
the
blanket
he
commanded
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
lorraine
set
her
mouth
stubbornly
well
then
i
have
to
lay
you
down
said
al
lifting
her
to
her
feet
if
you
get
balky
i
liable
to
get
rough
lorraine
drew
away
from
him
as
far
as
she
could
and
looked
at
him
for
a
full
minute
al
stared
back
into
her
eyes
oh
i
could
you
cried
lorraine
for
the
second
time
that
day
and
threw
herself
down
on
the
bed
sobbing
like
an
angry
child
al
said
nothing
the
man
capacity
for
keeping
still
was
amazing
he
knelt
beside
her
folded
the
blanket
over
her
from
the
two
sides
and
tied
the
corners
around
her
neck
snugly
the
knot
at
the
back
in
the
same
way
he
tied
her
ankles
lorraine
found
herself
in
a
sleeping
bag
from
which
she
had
small
hope
of
extricating
herself
he
took
his
coat
folded
it
compactly
and
pushed
it
under
her
head
for
a
pillow
then
he
brought
her
own
saddle
blanket
and
spread
it
over
her
for
extra
warmth
now
stop
your
bawling
and
go
to
sleep
he
advised
her
calmly
you
ai
hurt
and
you
ai
going
to
be
as
long
as
you
gentle
down
and
behave
yourself
she
saw
him
draw
the
slicker
over
his
shoulders
and
move
back
where
the
shadows
were
deep
and
she
could
not
see
him
she
heard
some
animal
squall
in
the
woods
behind
them
she
looked
up
at
the
stars
millions
of
them
and
brighter
than
she
had
ever
seen
them
before
insensibly
she
quieted
watching
the
stars
listening
to
the
night
noises
catching
now
and
then
a
whiff
of
smoke
from
al
woodruff
cigarette
before
she
knew
that
she
was
sleepy
she
slept

swan
cooked
himself
a
hasty
meal
while
he
studied
the
various
possibilities
of
the
case
and
waited
for
further
word
from
headquarters
he
wanted
to
be
sure
that
help
had
started
and
to
be
able
to
estimate
within
an
hour
or
two
the
probable
time
of
its
arrival
before
he
left
the
wireless
jack
he
fed
and
left
on
watch
outside
the
cabin
so
that
he
could
without
risk
keep
open
the
door
to
the
dugout
his
instrument
was
not
a
large
one
and
the
dugout
door
was
thick
as
a
precaution
against
discovery
if
he
should
be
called
when
some
visitor
chanced
to
be
in
the
cabin
not
often
did
a
man
ride
that
way
though
occasionally
some
one
stopped
for
a
meal
if
he
knew
that
the
cabin
was
there
and
had
ever
tasted
swan
biscuits
his
aerial
was
cleverly
camouflaged
between
the
two
pine
trees
and
he
had
no
fear
of
discovery
there
jack
was
a
faithful
guardian
and
would
give
warning
if
any
one
approached
the
place
swan
could
therefore
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
business
at
hand
he
was
not
yet
supplied
with
evidence
enough
to
warrant
arresting
warfield
and
hawkins
but
he
hoped
to
get
it
when
the
real
crisis
came
they
could
not
have
known
of
al
woodruff
intentions
toward
lorraine
else
they
would
have
kept
themselves
in
the
background
and
would
not
have
risked
the
failure
of
their
own
plan
on
the
other
hand
al
must
have
been
wholly
ignorant
of
scheme
to
try
and
prove
lorraine
crazy
it
looked
to
swan
very
much
like
a
muddling
of
the
sawtooth
affairs
through
to
avoid
trouble
they
were
afraid
of
what
lorraine
knew
they
wanted
to
eliminate
her
and
they
had
made
the
blunder
of
working
independently
to
that
end
lone
anxiety
he
did
not
even
consider
he
believed
that
lone
would
be
equal
to
any
immediate
emergency
and
would
do
whatever
the
circumstances
seemed
to
require
of
him
warfield
counted
him
a
sawtooth
man
al
woodruff
if
the
four
men
met
unexpectedly
would
also
take
it
for
granted
that
he
was
one
of
them
they
would
probably
talk
to
lone
without
reserve
swan
counted
on
that
whereas
if
he
were
present
they
would
be
on
their
guard
at
least
swan
plan
was
to
wait
at
the
cabin
until
he
knew
that
deputies
were
headed
toward
the
pass
then
with
jack
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
follow
warfield
to
where
he
overtook
al
supposing
he
did
overtake
him
if
he
did
not
then
swan
meant
to
be
present
when
the
meeting
occurred
the
dog
would
trail
al
anywhere
since
the
scent
would
be
less
than
hours
old
swan
would
locate
warfield
and
lead
him
straight
to
al
woodruff
and
then
make
his
arrests
but
he
wanted
to
have
the
deputies
there
at
dusk
he
got
his
call
he
learned
that
four
picked
men
had
started
for
the
pass
and
that
they
would
reach
the
divide
by
daybreak
others
were
on
their
way
to
intercept
al
woodruff
if
he
crossed
before
then
it
was
all
that
swan
could
have
hoped
for
more
than
he
had
dared
to
expect
on
such
short
notice
he
notified
the
operator
that
he
would
not
be
there
to
receive
anything
else
until
he
returned
to
report
that
he
had
got
his
men

facetiously
out
of

swan
sent
back
grinning
to
himself
as
he
rattled
the
key
that
irrigation
graft
is
killed
now
you
tell
the
boss
swan
says
so
he
right
the
way
to
catch
a
fox
is
to
watch
his
den
he
switched
off
the
current
closed
the
case
and
went
out
making
sure
that
the
door
looked
perfectly
innocent
on
the
outside
with
a
bannock
stuffed
into
one
pocket
a
chunk
of
bacon
in
the
other
he
left
the
cabin
and
swung
off
again
in
that
long
tireless
stride
of
his
jack
following
contentedly
at
his
heels
at
the
farther
end
of
skyline
meadow
he
stopped
took
a
tough
leather
leash
from
his
pocket
and
fastened
it
to
jack
collar
we
do
go
running
to
paw
nobody
stomach
and
say
here
we
are
back
again
he
told
the
dog
pulling
its
ears
affectionately
maybe
we
get
shot
or
something
like
that
we
trail
and
we
keep
our
mouth
still
yack
one
bark
and
i
lick
you
good
jack
flashed
out
a
pink
tongue
and
licked
his
master
chin
to
show
how
little
he
was
worried
over
the
threat
and
went
racing
along
at
the
end
of
the
leash
taking
swan
trail
and
his
own
back
to
where
they
had
climbed
out
of
the
canyon
at
the
bottom
swan
spoke
to
the
dog
in
an
undertone
and
jack
obediently
started
up
the
canyon
on
the
trail
of
the
five
horses
who
had
passed
that
way
since
noon
it
was
starlight
now
and
swan
did
not
hurry
he
was
taking
it
for
granted
that
warfield
and
hawkins
would
stop
when
it
became
too
dark
to
follow
the
hoofprints
and
without
jack
to
show
them
the
way
they
would
perforce
remain
where
they
were
until
daybreak
they
would
do
that
he
reasoned
if
they
were
sincere
in
wanting
to
overtake
lorraine
and
in
their
ignorance
that
they
were
also
following
al
woodruff
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
see
the
object
of
so
foolish
a
plan
as
this
abduction
carried
out
in
collusion
with
two
men
of
unknown
sentiments
in
the
party
they
had
shown
no
suspicion
of
part
in
the
affair
and
swan
grinned
when
he
thought
of
the
mutual
surprise
when
they
met
he
was
not
disappointed
they
reached
timber
line
following
the
seldom
used
trail
that
wound
over
the
divide
to
bear
top
pass
and
so
by
a
difficult
route
which
he
did
not
believe
al
would
attempt
after
dark
to
the
country
beyond
the
mountain
where
dark
overtook
them
they
stopped
in
a
sheltered
nook
to
wait
just
as
swan
had
expected
they
would
they
were
close
to
the
trail
where
no
one
could
pass
without
their
knowledge
in
the
belief
that
it
was
only
lorraine
they
were
following
and
that
she
would
be
frightened
and
would
come
to
the
cheer
of
a
campfire
they
had
a
fine
inviting
blaze
swan
made
his
way
as
close
as
he
dared
without
being
discovered
and
sat
down
to
wait
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
men
until
lone
appeared
and
fed
the
flames
more
wood
and
sat
down
where
the
light
shone
on
his
face
swan
grinned
again
warfield
had
probably
decided
that
lorraine
would
be
less
afraid
of
lone
than
of
them
and
had
ordered
him
into
the
firelight
as
a
sort
of
decoy
and
lone
knowing
that
al
woodruff
might
be
within
shooting
distance
was
probably
much
more
uncomfortable
than
he
looked
he
sat
with
his
legs
crossed
in
true
range
fashion
and
stared
into
the
fire
while
he
smoked
he
was
a
fair
mark
for
an
enemy
who
might
be
lurking
out
there
in
the
dark
but
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
realized
the
danger
of
his
position
neither
did
he
wear
any
air
of
expectancy
warfield
and
hawkins
might
wait
and
listen
and
hope
that
lorraine
and
weary
would
steal
up
to
the
warmth
of
the
fire
but
not
lone
swan
sitting
on
a
rotting
log
became
uneasy
at
the
fine
target
which
lone
made
by
the
fire
and
drew
al
woodruff
blue
bandanna
from
his
pocket
he
held
it
to
jack
nose
and
whispered
you
find
him
yack
and
i
lick
you
good
if
you
bark
jack
sniffed
dropped
his
nose
to
the
ground
and
began
tugging
at
the
leash
swan
got
up
and
moving
stealthily
followed
the
dog
chapter
i
coulda
loved
this
little
girl
a
chill

that
hurried
over
bear
top
ahead
of
the
dawn
brought
swan
and
jack
clattering
up
the
trail
that
dipped
into
spirit
canyon
warfield
rose
stiffly
from
the
warmth
of
the
fire
and
walked
a
few
paces
to
meet
him
shrugging
his
wide
shoulders
at
the
cold
and
rubbing
his
thigh
muscles
that
protested
against
movement
much
riding
upon
upholstered
cushions
had
not
helped
senator
warfield
to
retain
the
tough
muscles
of
bill
warfield
the
senator
was
as
well
as
hungry
and
his
temper
showed
in
his
eyes
he
would
have
quarreled
with
his
woman
that
morning
and
he
began
on
swan
why
had
he
come
back
down
the
gulch
yesterday
and
helped
track
the
girl
as
he
was
told
to
do
the
senator
had
quite
unpleasant
opinions
of
swedes
and
crazy
women
and
dogs
that
were
never
around
when
they
were
wanted
and
he
expressed
them
fluently
swan
explained
with
a
great
deal
of
labor
that
he
had
not
thought
he
was
wanted
and
that
he
had
to
sleep
on
his
claim
sometimes
or
the
law
would
take
it
from
him
maybe
also
he
virtuously
pointed
out
that
he
had
come
with
yack
before
daylight
to
the
canyon
to
see
if
they
had
found
miss
hunter
and
gone
home
or
if
they
were
still
hunting
for
her
if
you
like
to
find
that
jong
lady
i
put
yack
on
the
trail
quick
he
offered
placatingly
i
bet
you
yack
finds
her
in
an
hour
with
much
unnecessary
language
senator
warfield
told
him
to
get
to
work
and
the
three
tightened
cinches
mounted
their
horses
and
prepared
to
follow
swan
lead
swan
watched
his
chance
and
gave
lone
a
chunk
of
bannock
as
a
substitute
for
breakfast
and
lone
i
may
add
dropped
behind
his
companions
and
ate
every
crumb
of
it
in
spite
of
his
worry
over
lorraine
indeed
swan
eased
that
worry
too
when
they
were
climbing
the
pine
slope
where
al
had
killed
the
grouse
lone
had
forged
ahead
on
john
doe
and
swan
stopped
suddenly
pointing
to
the
spot
where
a
few
bloody
feathers
and
a
showed
the
other
evidence
jack
had
eaten
in
the
night
raine
all
right
lone
got
men
coming
keep
your
gun
handy
he
murmured
and
turned
away
as
the
others
rode
up
eager
for
whatever
news
swan
had
to
offer
something
killed
a
bird
swan
explained
politely
planting
one
of
his
own
big
feet
over
the
track
which
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
lorraine
yack
you
find
that
jong
lady
quick
from
there
on
swan
walked
carefully
putting
his
foot
wherever
a
print
of
al
boot
was
visible
since
he
was
much
bigger
than
al
with
a
correspondingly
longer
stride
his
gait
puzzled
lone
until
he
saw
just
what
swan
was
doing
then
his
eyes
lightened
with
amused
appreciation
of
the
swede
cunning
we
ought
to
have
some
hot
drink
or
whisky
when
we
find
that
girl
hawkins
muttered
unexpectedly
riding
up
beside
lone
as
they
crossed
an
open
space
she
be
with
cold
if
we
find
her
alive
before
lone
could
answer
swan
looked
back
at
the
two
and
raised
his
hand
for
them
to
stop
better
if
you
leave
the
horses
here
he
suggested
from
yack
i
know
we
get
close
pretty
quick
that
jong
lady
horse
maybe
smells
these
horse
and
makes
a
noise
and
crazy
folks
run
from
noise
without
objection
the
three
dismounted
and
tied
their
horses
securely
to
trees
then
with
swan
and
jack
leading
the
way
they
climbed
over
the
ridge
and
descended
into
the
hollow
by
way
of
the
ledge
which
skinner
had
negotiated
so
carefully
the
night
before
without
the
dog
they
never
would
have
guessed
that
any
one
had
passed
this
way
but
as
it
was
they
made
good
progress
and
reached
the
nearest
edge
of
the
spruce
thicket
just
as
the
sun
was
making
ready
to
push
up
over
the
skyline
jack
stopped
and
looked
up
at
his
master
inquiringly
lifting
his
lip
at
the
sides
and
showing
his
teeth
but
he
made
no
sound
nor
did
swan
when
he
dropped
his
fingers
to
the
dog
head
and
patted
him
approvingly
they
heard
a
horse
sneeze
beyond
the
spruce
grove
and
warfield
stepped
forward
authoritatively
waving
swan
back
this
his
manner
said
plainly
was
first
and
foremost
his
affair
and
from
now
on
he
would
take
charge
of
the
situation
at
his
heels
went
hawkins
and
swan
sent
an
oblique
glance
of
satisfaction
toward
lone
who
answered
it
with
his
swan
himself
could
not
have
planned
the
approach
more
to
his
liking
the
smell
of
bacon
cooking
watered
their
mouths
and
made
warfield
and
hawkins
look
at
one
another
inquiringly
crazy
young
women
would
hardly
be
expected
to
carry
a
camping
outfit
but
swan
and
lone
were
treading
close
on
their
heels
and
their
own
curiosity
pulled
them
forward
they
went
carefully
around
the
thicket
guided
by
the
pungent
odor
of
burning
pine
wood
and
halted
so
abruptly
that
swan
and
lone
bumped
into
them
from
behind
a
man
had
risen
up
from
the
campfire
and
faced
them
his
hands
rising
slowly
palms
outward
warfield
by
al
blurted
in
his
outraged
astonishment
trailing
me
with
a
bunch
are
yuh
i
knew
you
your
own
father
but
i
never
thought
you
had
it
in
you
to
do
it
in
the
open
damn
yuh
what
want
that
you
expect
to
get
warfield
stared
at
him
he
glanced
furtively
behind
him
at
swan
and
found
that
guileless
youth
ready
to
poke
him
in
the
back
with
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
lone
he
observed
had
another
he
looked
back
at
al
whose
eyes
were
ablaze
with
resentment
with
an
effort
he
smiled
his
disarming
senatorial
smile
but
al
next
words
froze
it
on
his
face
i
think
i
know
the
play
you
making
but
it
wo
get
you
anything
bill
warfield
you
think
i
slipped
up
and
you
told
me
not
to
let
my
foot
slip
said
you
hate
to
lose
me
well
you
the
one
that
slipped
you
damned
rotten
coward
i
was
watching
out
for
leaks
i
stopped
two
and
this
one
he
glanced
down
at
lorraine
who
sat
beside
the
fire
a
blanket
tied
tightly
around
her
waist
and
her
ankles
so
that
while
comfortably
free
she
could
make
no
move
to
escape
i
was
fixing
to
stop
from
telling
all
she
knew
he
added
harshly
by
i
have
had
her
married
to
me
you
damned
fool
and
here
you
blocked
everything
for
me
afraid
i
was
falling
down
on
my
job
now
folks
lem
me
just
tell
you
a
few
little
things
i
know
my
limit
you
got
me
dead
to
rights
i
ai
complaining
about
that
a
man
in
my
game
expects
to
get
his
some
day
but
i
ai
going
to
let
the
man
go
that
paid
me
my
wages
and
a
bonus
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
every
man
i
killed
that
he
wanted
outa
the
way
hawkins
knows
that
a
fact
he
foreman
of
the
sawtooth
and
he
knows
the
agreement
i
got
to
say
for
hawkins
that
aside
from
stealing
cattle
off
the
nesters
and
helping
make
evidence
against
some
that
in
jail
hawkins
never
done
any
dirty
work
he
did
have
to
they
paid
for
that
end
of
the
business
i
killed
fred
thurman
this
girl
here
saw
me
shoot
him
and
it
was
when
i
told
warfield
i
was
afraid
she
might
set
folks
talking
that
he
began
to
get
cold
feet
up
to
then
everything
was
lovely
but
warfield
began
to
crawfish
a
little
we
figured
figured
emphasize
the
folks
that
the
quirt
would
have
to
be
put
outa
business
we
knew
if
the
girl
told
brit
and
frank
they
maybe
get
the
nerve
to
try
and
pin
something
on
us
we
stole
blind
for
years
and
they
cry
if
we
got
hung
besides
they
was
friendly
with
fred
the
girl
and
the
swede
got
in
the
way
when
i
tried
to
bump
brit
off
i
have
gone
into
the
canyon
and
finished
him
with
a
rock
but
they
beat
me
to
it
the
girl
herself
i
could
get
at
very
well
and
make
it
look
accidental
and
anyway
i
never
did
kill
a
woman
and
i
hate
it
like
hell
i
figured
if
her
dad
got
killed
she
leave
and
let
me
tell
you
folks
warfield
raised
hell
with
me
because
brit
hunter
was
killed
when
he
pitched
over
the
grade
he
held
out
on
me
for
that
job
so
i
collecting
five
hundred
dollars
worth
of
fun
right
now
he
did
say
he
pay
me
after
brit
was
dead
but
it
looks
like
going
to
pull
through
so
i
ai
counting
much
on
getting
my
money
outa
warfield
frank
i
got
and
made
a
clean
job
of
it
and
yesterday
morning
the
girl
played
into
my
hands
she
rode
over
to
the
sawtooth
and
i
got
her
at
thurman
place
on
her
way
home
and
figured
i
marry
her
and
take
a
chance
on
keeping
her
quiet
afterwards
i
have
been
down
the
pass
in
another
two
hours
and
heading
for
the
nearest
county
seat
she
have
married
me
too
she
knows
i
have
killed
her
if
she
did
which
i
would
i
been
square
with
her
she
tell
you
that
i
told
her
when
i
took
her
just
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
her
so
that
all
straight
she
been
scared
i
guess
but
she
ai
gone
hungry
and
she
ai
suffered
except
in
her
mind
i
do
fight
women
and
say
right
now
to
her
and
to
you
that
i
got
all
the
respect
in
the
world
for
this
little
girl
and
if
i
married
her
i
have
been
as
good
to
her
as
i
know
how
and
as
she
let
me
be
now
i
want
to
tell
you
folks
a
few
more
things
about
bill
warfield
if
you
want
to
stop
the
damnest
steal
in
the
country
tie
a
can
onto
that
irrigation
scheme
of
his
he
out
to
hold
up
the
state
for
all
he
can
get
and
bleed
the
poor
devils
of
farmers
white
that
buys
land
under
that
canal
it
may
look
good
but
it
ai
good
not
by
a
damn
sight
yuh
know
what
he
figuring
on
doing
get
water
in
the
canal
sell
land
under
a
contract
that
lets
him
out
if
the
ditch
breaks
or
something
so
he
supply
water
at
any
time
and
when
them
poor
suckers
gets
their
crops
all
in
and
at
the
point
where
they
got
to
have
water
or
lose
out
something
happen
to
the
supply
folks
i
i
a
reliable
man
and
i
rode
with
a
rope
around
my
neck
for
over
five
years
and
warfield
offered
me
the
same
old
five
hundred
every
time
i
monkeyed
with
the
water
supply
as
ordered
he
have
done
it
slick
do
worry
none
about
that
the
biggest
band
of
thieves
he
could
get
together
is
that
company
so
if
you
folks
have
got
any
sense
bust
it
up
right
now
bill
warfield
what
i
got
to
say
to
wo
take
long
you
thought
you
make
a
play
with
the
law
and
at
the
same
time
put
me
outa
the
way
you
figured
i
resist
arrest
and
you
have
a
chance
to
shoot
me
down
i
know
your
rotten
mind
better
than
you
do
you
wanted
to
bump
me
off
but
you
wanted
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
put
you
in
right
with
the
public
killing
me
for
kidnapping
this
girl
would
sound
damn
romantic
in
the
newspapers
and
it
would
have
a
thing
to
do
with
thurman
or
frank
johnson
or
any
of
the
rest
that
i
sent
over
the
trail
for
you
right
now
you
figuring
how
you
get
around
this
giving
you
there
nobody
to
take
down
what
i
say
and
i
just
a
mean
ornery
outlaw
and
killer
talking
for
spite
with
your
pull
you
expect
to
get
this
smoothed
over
and
hushed
up
and
have
me
at
a
hanging
bee
and
everything
all
right
for
bill
well
his
eyes
left
warfield
face
and
went
beyond
the
staring
group
his
face
darkened
a
sneer
twisted
his
lips
who
them
others
he
cried
harshly
was
you
afraid
four
would
be
enough
to
take
me
the
four
turned
heads
to
look
bill
warfield
never
looked
back
for
gun
spoke
and
warfield
sagged
at
the
knees
and
the
shoulders
and
he
slumped
to
the
ground
at
the
instant
when
al
gun
spoke
again
that
for
you
lone
morgan
al
cried
as
he
fired
again

two
of
the
deputies
who
had
been
there
through
half
of
bitter
talk
lorraine
unable
to
get
up
and
run
too
sturdy

soul
to

rolled
over
and
away
from

spitfire

to

all
within
three
feet
of
her
his
face
toward
her
and
his
eyes
agonizing
to
meet
hers
he
died
chapter
another
story
begins
this
chapter
is
very
much
like
a
preface
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
although
many
persons
will
read
it
and
a
few
will
be
glad
that
it
was
written
the
story
itself
is
ended
to
go
on
would
be
to
begin
another
story
to
tell
of
the
building
up
of
the
quirt
outfit
with
lone
and
savings
playing
a
very
important
part
and
with
brit
a
retired
stockman
who
smoked
his
pipe
and
told
the
young
couple
what
they
should
do
and
how
they
should
do
it
frank
he
mourned
for
and
seldom
mentioned
the
sawtooth
under
the
management
of
a
greatly
chastened
young
bob
warfield
was
slowly
winning
its
way
back
to
the
respect
of
its
neighbors
for
certain
personal
reasons
there
was
no
real
neighborliness
between
the
quirt
and
the
sawtooth
there
could
not
be
so
long
as
brit
memory
remained
clear
and
bob
was
every
day
reminded
of
the
crimes
his
father
had
paid
a
man
to
commit
moreover
southerners
are
jealous
of
their
women
it
is
their
especial
prerogative
and
lone
suspected
that
given
the
opportunity
bob
warfield
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
lorraine
indeed
he
suspected
that
any
man
in
the
country
would
have
done
that
al
woodruff
had
and
he
was
noted
for
his
indifference
to
women
and
his
implacable
hardness
toward
men
but
you
are
not
to
accuse
lone
of
being
a
jealous
husband
he
was
not
and
i
am
merely
pointing
out
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
had
he
been
given
any
cause
oh
by
the
way
swan
proved
up
as
soon
as
possible
on
his
homestead
and
sold
out
to
the
quirt
lone
managed
to
buy
the
thurman
ranch
also
and
the
tj
is
on
its
feet
again
as

ranch
sorry
and
jim
will
ride
for
the
quirt
i
suppose
as
long
as
they
can
crawl
into
a
saddle
but
there
are
younger
men
now
to
ride
the
skyline
meadow
range
some
one
asked
about
yellowjacket
having
i
suppose
a
sneaking
regard
for
his
infirmities
he
has
been
peeled
yet
or
he
had
the
last
i
heard
of
him
lone
and
lorraine
told
me
they
were
trying
to
save
him
for
the
little
feller
to
practise
on
when
he
is
able
to
sit
up
without
a
cushion
behind
his
back
and
to
hold
something
besides
a
rubber
rattle
and
oh
do
you
know
how
lone
is
teaching
the
little
feller
to
sit
up
on
the
floor
he
took
a
horse
collar
and
scrubbed
it
until
he
nearly
wore
out
the
leather
then
he
brought
it
to
the
cabin
put
it
on
the
floor
and
set
the
little
feller
inside
it
they
sent
me
a
of
the
event
but
it
is
not
very
good
the
film
was
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
little
feller
except
a
hazy
spot
which
i
judged
was
a
hand
holding
a
black
object
i
guessed
was
the
ridgy
rubber
rattle
with
the
whistle
gone
out
of
the
end
down
the
little
feller
throat
they
are
afraid
and
there
was
his
smile
and
a
glimpse
of
his
eyes
are
you
envious
as
sin
and
glad
they
so
