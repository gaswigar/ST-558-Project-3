rowland
mallet
had
made
his
arrangements
to
sail
for
europe
on
the
first
of
september
and
having
in
the
interval
a
fortnight
to
spare
he
determined
to
spend
it
with
his
cousin
cecilia
the
widow
of
a
nephew
of
his
father
he
was
urged
by
the
reflection
that
an
affectionate
farewell
might
help
to
exonerate
him
from
the
charge
of
neglect
frequently
preferred
by
this
lady
it
was
not
that
the
young
man
disliked
her
on
the
contrary
he
regarded
her
with
a
tender
admiration
and
he
had
not
forgotten
how
when
his
cousin
had
brought
her
home
on
her
marriage
he
had
seemed
to
feel
the
upward
sweep
of
the
empty
bough
from
which
the
golden
fruit
had
been
plucked
and
had
then
and
there
accepted
the
prospect
of
bachelorhood
the
truth
was
that
as
it
will
be
part
of
the
entertainment
of
this
narrative
to
exhibit
rowland
mallet
had
an
uncomfortably
sensitive
conscience
and
that
in
spite
of
the
seeming
paradox
his
visits
to
cecilia
were
rare
because
she
and
her
misfortunes
were
often
uppermost
in
it
her
misfortunes
were
three
in
number
first
she
had
lost
her
husband
second
she
had
lost
her
money
or
the
greater
part
of
it
and
third
she
lived
at
northampton
massachusetts
mallet
s
compassion
was
really
wasted
because
cecilia
was
a
very
clever
woman
and
a
most
skillful
to
adversity
she
had
made
herself
a
charming
home
her
economies
were
not
obtrusive
and
there
was
always
a
cheerful
flutter
in
the
folds
of
her
crape
it
was
the
consciousness
of
all
this
that
puzzled
mallet
whenever
he
felt
tempted
to
put
in
his
oar
he
had
money
and
he
had
time
but
he
never
could
decide
just
how
to
place
these
gifts
gracefully
at
cecilia
s
service
he
no
longer
felt
like
marrying
her
in
these
eight
years
that
fancy
had
died
a
natural
death
and
yet
her
extreme
cleverness
seemed
somehow
to
make
charity
difficult
and
patronage
impossible
he
would
rather
chop
off
his
hand
than
offer
her
a
check
a
piece
of
useful
furniture
or
a
black
silk
dress
and
yet
there
was
some
sadness
in
seeing
such
a
bright
proud
woman
living
in
such
a
small
dull
way
cecilia
had
moreover
a
turn
for
sarcasm
and
her
smile
which
was
her
pretty
feature
was
never
so
pretty
as
when
her
sprightly
phrase
had
a
lurking
scratch
in
it
rowland
remembered
that
for
him
she
was
all
smiles
and
suspected
awkwardly
that
he
ministered
not
a
little
to
her
sense
of
the
irony
of
things
and
in
truth
with
his
means
his
leisure
and
his
opportunities
what
had
he
done
he
had
an
unaffected
suspicion
of
his
uselessness
cecilia
meanwhile
cut
out
her
own
dresses
and
was
personally
giving
her
little
girl
the
education
of
a
princess
this
time
however
he
presented
himself
bravely
enough
for
in
the
way
of
activity
it
was
something
definite
at
least
to
be
going
to
europe
and
to
be
meaning
to
spend
the
winter
in
rome
cecilia
met
him
in
the
early
dusk
at
the
gate
of
her
little
garden
amid
a
studied
combination
of
floral
perfumes
a
rosy
widow
of
half
cousin
half
hostess
doing
the
honors
of
an
odorous
cottage
on
a
midsummer
evening
was
a
phenomenon
to
which
the
young
man
s
imagination
was
able
to
do
ample
justice
cecilia
was
always
gracious
but
this
evening
she
was
almost
joyous
she
was
in
a
happy
mood
and
mallet
imagined
there
was
a
private
reason
for
it
a
reason
quite
distinct
from
her
pleasure
in
receiving
her
honored
kinsman
the
next
day
he
flattered
himself
he
was
on
the
way
to
discover
it
for
the
present
after
tea
as
they
sat
on
the
porch
while
rowland
held
his
younger
cousin
between
his
knees
and
she
enjoying
her
situation
listened
timorously
for
the
stroke
of
bedtime
cecilia
insisted
on
talking
more
about
her
visitor
than
about
herself
what
is
it
you
mean
to
do
in
europe
she
asked
lightly
giving
a
turn
to
the
frill
of
her
sleeve
just
such
a
turn
as
seemed
to
mallet
to
bring
out
all
the
latent
difficulties
of
the
question
why
very
much
what
i
do
here
he
answered
no
great
is
it
true
cecilia
asked
that
here
you
do
no
great
harm
is
not
a
man
like
you
doing
harm
when
he
is
not
doing
positive
good
your
compliment
is
ambiguous
said
rowland
no
answered
the
widow
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
you
have
a
particular
aptitude
for
beneficence
you
have
it
in
the
first
place
in
your
character
you
are
a
benevolent
person
ask
bessie
if
you
don
t
hold
her
more
gently
and
comfortably
than
any
of
her
other
he
holds
me
more
comfortably
than
hudson
bessie
declared
roundly
rowland
not
knowing
hudson
could
but
half
appreciate
the
eulogy
and
cecilia
went
on
to
develop
her
idea
your
circumstances
in
the
second
place
suggest
the
idea
of
social
usefulness
you
are
intelligent
you
are
and
your
charity
if
one
may
call
it
charity
would
be
discriminating
you
are
rich
and
unoccupied
so
that
it
might
be
abundant
therefore
i
say
you
are
a
person
to
do
something
on
a
large
scale
bestir
yourself
dear
rowland
or
we
may
be
taught
to
think
that
virtue
herself
is
setting
a
bad
heaven
forbid
cried
rowland
that
i
should
set
the
examples
of
virtue
i
am
quite
willing
to
follow
them
however
and
if
i
don
t
do
something
on
the
grand
scale
it
is
that
my
genius
is
altogether
imitative
and
that
i
have
not
recently
encountered
any
very
striking
models
of
grandeur
pray
what
shall
i
do
found
an
orphan
asylum
or
build
a
dormitory
for
harvard
college
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
do
either
in
an
ideally
handsome
way
and
i
confess
that
yet
awhile
i
feel
too
young
to
strike
my
grand
coup
i
am
holding
myself
ready
for
inspiration
i
am
waiting
till
something
takes
my
fancy
irresistibly
if
inspiration
comes
at
forty
it
will
be
a
hundred
pities
to
have
tied
up
my
at
well
i
give
you
till
forty
said
cecilia
it
s
only
a
word
to
the
wise
a
notification
that
you
are
expected
not
to
run
your
course
without
having
done
something
handsome
for
your
nine
o
clock
sounded
and
bessie
with
each
stroke
courted
a
closer
embrace
but
a
single
winged
word
from
her
mother
overleaped
her
successive
intrenchments
she
turned
and
kissed
her
cousin
and
deposited
an
irrepressible
tear
on
his
moustache
then
she
went
and
said
her
prayers
to
her
mother
it
was
evident
she
was
being
admirably
brought
up
rowland
with
the
permission
of
his
hostess
lighted
a
cigar
and
puffed
it
awhile
in
silence
cecilia
s
interest
in
his
career
seemed
very
agreeable
that
mallet
was
without
vanity
i
by
no
means
intend
to
affirm
but
there
had
been
times
when
seeing
him
accept
hardly
less
deferentially
advice
even
more
peremptory
than
the
widow
s
you
might
have
asked
yourself
what
had
become
of
his
vanity
now
in
the
starlight
he
felt
gently
wooed
to
egotism
there
was
a
project
connected
with
his
going
abroad
which
it
was
on
his
tongue
s
end
to
communicate
it
had
no
relation
to
hospitals
or
dormitories
and
yet
it
would
have
sounded
very
generous
but
it
was
not
because
it
would
have
sounded
generous
that
poor
mallet
at
last
puffed
it
away
in
the
fumes
of
his
cigar
useful
though
it
might
be
it
expressed
most
imperfectly
the
young
man
s
own
personal
conception
of
usefulness
he
was
extremely
fond
of
all
the
arts
and
he
had
an
almost
passionate
enjoyment
of
pictures
he
had
seen
many
and
he
judged
them
sagaciously
it
had
occurred
to
him
some
time
before
that
it
would
be
the
work
of
a
good
citizen
to
go
abroad
and
with
all
expedition
and
secrecy
purchase
certain
valuable
specimens
of
the
dutch
and
italian
schools
as
to
which
he
had
received
private
proposals
and
then
present
his
treasures
out
of
hand
to
an
american
city
not
unknown
to
aesthetic
fame
in
which
at
that
time
there
prevailed
a
good
deal
of
fruitless
aspiration
toward
an
he
had
seen
himself
in
imagination
more
than
once
in
some
mouldy
old
saloon
of
a
florentine
palace
turning
toward
the
deep
embrasure
of
the
window
some
ghirlandaio
or
botticelli
while
a
host
in
reduced
circumstances
pointed
out
the
lovely
drawing
of
a
hand
but
he
imparted
none
of
these
visions
to
cecilia
and
he
suddenly
swept
them
away
with
the
declaration
that
he
was
of
course
an
idle
useless
creature
and
that
he
would
probably
be
even
more
so
in
europe
than
at
home
the
only
thing
is
he
said
that
there
i
shall
seem
to
be
doing
something
i
shall
be
better
entertained
and
shall
be
therefore
i
suppose
in
a
better
humor
with
life
you
may
say
that
that
is
just
the
humor
a
useless
man
should
keep
out
of
he
should
cultivate
discontentment
i
did
a
good
many
things
when
i
was
in
europe
before
but
i
did
not
spend
a
winter
in
rome
every
one
assures
me
that
this
is
a
peculiar
refinement
of
bliss
most
people
talk
about
rome
in
the
same
way
it
is
evidently
only
a
sort
of
idealized
form
of
loafing
a
passive
life
in
rome
thanks
to
the
number
and
the
quality
of
one
s
impressions
takes
on
a
very
respectable
likeness
to
activity
it
is
still
only
you
sit
down
at
table
and
the
lotuses
are
served
up
on
rococo
china
it
s
all
very
well
but
i
have
a
distinct
prevision
of
this
that
if
roman
life
does
n
t
do
something
substantial
to
make
you
happier
it
increases
tenfold
your
liability
to
moral
misery
it
seems
to
me
a
rash
thing
for
a
sensitive
soul
deliberately
to
cultivate
its
sensibilities
by
rambling
too
often
among
the
ruins
of
the
palatine
or
riding
too
often
in
the
shadow
of
the
aqueducts
in
such
recreations
the
chords
of
feeling
grow
tense
and
to
spare
your
intellectual
nerves
must
play
upon
them
with
a
touch
as
dainty
as
the
tread
of
mignon
when
she
danced
her
i
should
have
said
my
dear
rowland
said
cecilia
with
a
laugh
that
your
nerves
were
tough
that
your
eggs
were
hard
that
being
stupid
you
mean
i
might
be
happy
upon
my
word
i
am
not
i
am
clever
enough
to
want
more
than
i
ve
got
i
am
tired
of
myself
my
own
thoughts
my
own
affairs
my
own
eternal
company
true
happiness
we
are
told
consists
in
getting
out
of
one
s
self
but
the
point
is
not
only
to
get
out
you
must
stay
out
and
to
stay
out
you
must
have
some
absorbing
errand
unfortunately
i
ve
got
no
errand
and
nobody
will
trust
me
with
one
i
want
to
care
for
something
or
for
some
one
and
i
want
to
care
with
a
certain
ardor
even
if
you
can
believe
it
with
a
certain
passion
i
can
t
just
now
feel
ardent
and
passionate
about
a
hospital
or
a
dormitory
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
that
i
m
a
man
of
genius
half
finished
the
genius
has
been
left
out
the
faculty
of
expression
is
wanting
but
the
need
for
expression
remains
and
i
spend
my
days
groping
for
the
latch
of
a
closed
what
an
immense
number
of
words
said
cecilia
after
a
pause
to
say
you
want
to
fall
in
love
i
ve
no
doubt
you
have
as
good
a
genius
for
that
as
any
one
if
you
would
only
trust
of
course
i
ve
thought
of
that
and
i
assure
you
i
hold
myself
ready
but
evidently
i
m
not
inflammable
is
there
in
northampton
some
perfect
epitome
of
the
graces
of
the
graces
said
cecilia
raising
her
eyebrows
and
suppressing
too
distinct
a
consciousness
of
being
herself
a
rosy
embodiment
of
several
the
household
virtues
are
better
represented
there
are
some
excellent
girls
and
there
are
two
or
three
very
pretty
ones
i
will
have
them
here
one
by
one
to
tea
if
you
i
should
particularly
like
it
especially
as
i
should
give
you
a
chance
to
see
by
the
profundity
of
my
attention
that
if
i
am
not
happy
it
s
not
for
want
of
taking
cecilia
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
on
the
whole
she
resumed
i
don
t
think
there
are
any
worth
asking
there
are
none
so
very
pretty
none
so
very
are
you
very
sure
asked
the
young
man
rising
and
throwing
away
his
upon
my
word
cried
cecilia
one
would
suppose
i
wished
to
keep
you
for
myself
of
course
i
am
sure
but
as
the
penalty
of
your
insinuations
i
shall
invite
the
plainest
and
prosiest
damsel
that
can
be
found
and
leave
you
alone
with
rowland
smiled
even
against
her
he
said
i
should
be
sorry
to
conclude
until
i
had
given
her
my
respectful
this
little
profession
of
ideal
chivalry
which
closed
the
conversation
was
not
quite
so
fanciful
on
mallet
s
lips
as
it
would
have
been
on
those
of
many
another
man
as
a
rapid
glance
at
his
antecedents
may
help
to
make
the
reader
perceive
his
life
had
been
a
singular
mixture
of
the
rough
and
the
smooth
he
had
sprung
from
a
rigid
puritan
stock
and
had
been
brought
up
to
think
much
more
intently
of
the
duties
of
this
life
than
of
its
privileges
and
pleasures
his
progenitors
had
submitted
in
the
matter
of
dogmatic
theology
to
the
relaxing
influences
of
recent
years
but
if
rowland
s
youthful
consciousness
was
not
chilled
by
the
menace
of
long
punishment
for
brief
transgression
he
had
at
least
been
made
to
feel
that
there
ran
through
all
things
a
strain
of
right
and
of
wrong
as
different
after
all
in
their
complexions
as
the
texture
to
the
spiritual
sense
of
sundays
and
his
father
was
a
chip
of
the
primal
puritan
block
a
man
with
an
icy
smile
and
a
stony
frown
he
had
always
bestowed
on
his
son
on
principle
more
frowns
than
smiles
and
if
the
lad
had
not
been
turned
to
stone
himself
it
was
because
nature
had
blessed
him
inwardly
with
a
well
of
vivifying
waters
mallet
had
been
a
miss
rowland
the
daughter
of
a
retired
once
famous
on
the
ships
that
sailed
from
salem
and
newburyport
he
had
brought
to
port
many
a
cargo
which
crowned
the
edifice
of
fortunes
already
almost
colossal
but
he
had
also
done
a
little
sagacious
trading
on
his
own
account
and
he
was
able
to
retire
prematurely
for
so
a
maritime
organism
upon
a
pension
of
his
own
providing
he
was
to
be
seen
for
a
year
on
the
salem
wharves
smoking
the
best
tobacco
and
eying
the
seaward
horizon
with
an
inveteracy
which
superficial
minds
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
repentance
at
last
one
evening
he
disappeared
beneath
it
as
he
had
often
done
before
this
time
however
not
as
a
commissioned
navigator
but
simply
as
an
amateur
of
an
observing
turn
likely
to
prove
oppressive
to
the
officer
in
command
of
the
vessel
five
months
later
his
place
at
home
knew
him
again
and
made
the
acquaintance
also
of
a
handsome
blonde
young
woman
of
redundant
contours
speaking
a
foreign
tongue
the
foreign
tongue
proved
after
much
conflicting
research
to
be
the
idiom
of
amsterdam
and
the
young
woman
which
was
stranger
still
to
be
captain
rowland
s
wife
why
he
had
gone
forth
so
suddenly
across
the
seas
to
marry
her
what
had
happened
between
them
before
and
whether
though
it
was
of
questionable
propriety
for
a
good
citizen
to
espouse
a
young
person
of
mysterious
origin
who
did
her
hair
in
fantastically
elaborate
plaits
and
in
whose
appearance
figure
enjoyed
such
striking
predominance
he
would
not
have
had
a
heavy
weight
on
his
conscience
if
he
had
remained
an
irresponsible
bachelor
these
questions
and
many
others
bearing
with
varying
degrees
of
immediacy
on
the
subject
were
much
propounded
but
scantily
answered
and
this
history
need
not
be
charged
with
resolving
them
rowland
for
so
handsome
a
woman
proved
a
tranquil
neighbor
and
an
excellent
housewife
her
extremely
fresh
complexion
however
was
always
suffused
with
an
air
of
apathetic
homesickness
and
she
played
her
part
in
american
society
chiefly
by
having
the
little
squares
of
brick
pavement
in
front
of
her
dwelling
scoured
and
polished
as
nearly
as
possible
into
the
likeness
of
dutch
tiles
rowland
mallet
remembered
having
seen
her
as
a
child
an
immensely
stout
lady
wearing
a
high
cap
of
very
stiff
tulle
speaking
english
with
a
formidable
accent
and
suffering
from
dropsy
captain
rowland
was
a
little
bronzed
and
wizened
man
with
eccentric
opinions
he
advocated
the
creation
of
a
public
promenade
along
the
sea
with
arbors
and
little
green
tables
for
the
consumption
of
beer
and
a
platform
surrounded
by
chinese
lanterns
for
dancing
he
especially
desired
the
town
library
to
be
opened
on
sundays
though
as
he
never
entered
it
on
it
was
easy
to
turn
the
proposition
into
ridicule
if
therefore
mallet
was
a
woman
of
an
exquisite
moral
tone
it
was
not
that
she
had
inherited
her
temper
from
an
ancestry
with
a
turn
for
casuistry
jonas
mallet
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
was
conducting
with
silent
shrewdness
a
small
unpromising
business
both
his
shrewdness
and
his
silence
increased
with
his
years
and
at
the
close
of
his
life
he
was
an
extremely
gentleman
with
a
frigid
gray
eye
who
said
little
to
anybody
but
of
whom
everybody
said
that
he
had
a
very
handsome
fortune
he
was
not
a
sentimental
father
and
the
roughness
i
just
now
spoke
of
in
rowland
s
life
dated
from
his
early
boyhood
mallet
whenever
he
looked
at
his
son
felt
extreme
compunction
at
having
made
a
fortune
he
remembered
that
the
fruit
had
not
dropped
ripe
from
the
tree
into
his
own
mouth
and
determined
it
should
be
no
fault
of
his
if
the
boy
was
corrupted
by
luxury
rowland
therefore
except
for
a
good
deal
of
expensive
instruction
in
foreign
tongues
and
abstruse
sciences
received
the
education
of
a
poor
man
s
son
his
fare
was
plain
his
temper
familiar
with
the
discipline
of
patched
trousers
and
his
habits
marked
by
an
exaggerated
simplicity
which
it
really
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
to
preserve
unbroken
he
was
kept
in
the
country
for
months
together
in
the
midst
of
servants
who
had
strict
injunctions
to
see
that
he
suffered
no
serious
harm
but
were
as
strictly
forbidden
to
wait
upon
him
as
no
school
could
be
found
conducted
on
principles
sufficiently
rigorous
he
was
attended
at
home
by
a
master
who
set
a
high
price
on
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
illustrate
the
beauty
of
abstinence
not
only
by
precept
but
by
example
rowland
passed
for
a
child
of
ordinary
parts
and
certainly
during
his
younger
years
was
an
excellent
imitation
of
a
boy
who
had
inherited
nothing
whatever
that
was
to
make
life
easy
he
was
passive
pliable
frank
extremely
slow
at
his
books
and
inordinately
fond
of
his
hair
a
memento
of
his
dutch
ancestry
was
of
the
fairest
shade
of
yellow
his
complexion
absurdly
rosy
and
his
measurement
around
the
waist
when
he
was
about
ten
years
old
quite
alarmingly
large
this
however
was
but
an
episode
in
his
growth
he
became
afterwards
a
man
but
he
was
never
accused
of
anything
worse
than
a
tendency
to
corpulence
he
emerged
from
childhood
a
simple
wholesome
lad
with
no
suspicion
that
a
less
roundabout
course
might
have
been
taken
to
make
him
happy
but
with
a
vague
sense
that
his
young
experience
was
not
a
fair
sample
of
human
freedom
and
that
he
was
to
make
a
great
many
discoveries
when
he
was
about
fifteen
he
achieved
a
momentous
one
he
ascertained
that
his
mother
was
a
saint
she
had
always
been
a
very
distinct
presence
in
his
life
but
so
ineffably
gentle
a
one
that
his
sense
was
fully
opened
to
it
only
by
the
danger
of
losing
her
she
had
an
illness
which
for
many
months
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
terminate
fatally
and
during
her
convalescence
she
removed
the
mask
which
she
had
worn
for
years
by
her
husband
s
order
rowland
spent
his
days
at
her
side
and
felt
before
long
as
if
he
had
made
a
new
friend
all
his
impressions
at
this
period
were
commented
and
interpreted
at
leisure
in
the
future
and
it
was
only
then
that
he
understood
that
his
mother
had
been
for
fifteen
years
a
perfectly
unhappy
woman
her
marriage
had
been
an
immitigable
error
which
she
had
spent
her
life
in
trying
to
look
straight
in
the
face
she
found
nothing
to
oppose
to
her
husband
s
will
of
steel
but
the
appearance
of
absolute
compliance
her
spirit
sank
and
she
lived
for
a
while
in
a
sort
of
helpless
moral
torpor
but
at
last
as
her
child
emerged
from
babyhood
she
began
to
feel
a
certain
charm
in
patience
to
discover
the
uses
of
ingenuity
and
to
learn
that
somehow
or
other
one
can
always
arrange
one
s
life
she
cultivated
from
this
time
forward
a
little
private
plot
of
sentiment
and
it
was
of
this
secluded
precinct
that
before
her
death
she
gave
her
son
the
key
rowland
s
allowance
at
college
was
barely
sufficient
to
maintain
him
decently
and
as
soon
as
he
graduated
he
was
taken
into
his
father
s
to
do
small
drudgery
on
a
proportionate
salary
for
three
years
he
earned
his
living
as
regularly
as
the
obscure
functionary
in
fustian
who
swept
the
office
mallet
was
consistent
but
the
perfection
of
his
consistency
was
known
only
on
his
death
he
left
but
a
third
of
his
property
to
his
son
and
devoted
the
remainder
to
various
public
institutions
and
local
charities
rowland
s
third
was
an
easy
competence
and
he
never
felt
a
moment
s
jealousy
of
his
but
when
one
of
the
establishments
which
had
figured
most
advantageously
in
his
father
s
will
bethought
itself
to
affirm
the
existence
of
a
later
instrument
in
which
it
had
been
still
more
handsomely
treated
the
young
man
felt
a
sudden
passionate
need
to
repel
the
claim
by
process
of
law
there
was
a
lively
tussle
but
he
gained
his
case
immediately
after
which
he
made
in
another
quarter
a
donation
of
the
contested
sum
he
cared
nothing
for
the
money
but
he
had
felt
an
angry
desire
to
protest
against
a
destiny
which
seemed
determined
to
be
exclusively
salutary
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
bear
a
little
spoiling
and
yet
he
treated
himself
to
a
very
modest
quantity
and
submitted
without
reserve
to
the
great
national
discipline
which
began
in
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
he
immediately
obtained
a
commission
and
did
his
duty
for
three
long
years
as
a
citizen
soldier
his
duty
was
obscure
but
he
never
lost
a
certain
private
satisfaction
in
remembering
that
on
two
or
three
occasions
it
had
been
performed
with
something
of
an
ideal
precision
he
had
disentangled
himself
from
business
and
after
the
war
he
felt
a
profound
disinclination
to
tie
the
knot
again
he
had
no
desire
to
make
money
he
had
money
enough
and
although
he
knew
and
was
frequently
reminded
that
a
young
man
is
the
better
for
a
fixed
occupation
he
could
discover
no
moral
advantage
in
driving
a
lucrative
trade
yet
few
young
men
of
means
and
leisure
ever
made
less
of
a
parade
of
idleness
and
indeed
idleness
in
any
degree
could
hardly
be
laid
at
the
door
of
a
young
man
who
took
life
in
the
serious
attentive
reasoning
fashion
of
our
friend
it
often
seemed
to
mallet
that
he
wholly
lacked
the
prime
requisite
of
a
graceful
flaneur
the
simple
sensuous
confident
relish
of
pleasure
he
had
frequent
fits
of
extreme
melancholy
in
which
he
declared
that
he
was
neither
fish
nor
flesh
nor
good
red
herring
he
was
neither
an
irresponsibly
contemplative
nature
nor
a
sturdily
practical
one
and
he
was
forever
looking
in
vain
for
the
uses
of
the
things
that
please
and
the
charm
of
the
things
that
sustain
he
was
an
awkward
mixture
of
strong
moral
impulse
and
restless
aesthetic
curiosity
and
yet
he
would
have
made
a
most
ineffective
reformer
and
a
very
indifferent
artist
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
glow
of
happiness
must
be
found
either
in
action
of
some
immensely
solid
kind
on
behalf
of
an
idea
or
in
producing
a
masterpiece
in
one
of
the
arts
oftenest
perhaps
he
wished
he
were
a
vigorous
young
man
of
genius
without
a
penny
as
it
was
he
could
only
buy
pictures
and
not
paint
them
and
in
the
way
of
action
he
had
to
content
himself
with
making
a
rule
to
render
scrupulous
moral
justice
to
handsome
examples
of
it
in
others
on
the
whole
he
had
an
incorruptible
modesty
with
his
blooming
complexion
and
his
serene
gray
eye
he
felt
the
friction
of
existence
more
than
was
suspected
but
he
asked
no
allowance
on
grounds
of
temper
he
assumed
that
fate
had
treated
him
inordinately
well
and
that
he
had
no
excuse
for
taking
an
view
of
life
and
he
undertook
constantly
to
believe
that
all
women
were
fair
all
men
were
brave
and
the
world
was
a
delightful
place
of
sojourn
until
the
contrary
had
been
distinctly
proved
cecilia
s
blooming
garden
and
shady
porch
had
seemed
so
friendly
to
repose
and
a
cigar
that
she
reproached
him
the
next
morning
with
indifference
to
her
little
parlor
not
less
in
its
way
a
monument
to
her
ingenious
taste
and
by
the
way
she
added
as
he
followed
her
in
if
i
refused
last
night
to
show
you
a
pretty
girl
i
can
at
least
show
you
a
pretty
she
threw
open
a
window
and
pointed
to
a
statuette
which
occupied
the
place
of
honor
among
the
ornaments
of
the
room
rowland
looked
at
it
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
her
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
she
gave
him
a
rapid
glance
perceived
that
her
statuette
was
of
altogether
exceptional
merit
and
then
smiled
knowingly
as
if
this
had
long
been
an
agreeable
certainty
who
did
it
where
did
you
get
it
rowland
demanded
oh
said
cecilia
adjusting
the
light
it
s
a
little
thing
of
hudson
and
who
the
deuce
is
hudson
asked
rowland
but
he
was
absorbed
he
lost
her
immediate
reply
the
statuette
in
bronze
something
less
than
two
feet
high
represented
a
naked
youth
drinking
from
a
gourd
the
attitude
was
perfectly
simple
the
lad
was
squarely
planted
on
his
feet
with
his
legs
a
little
apart
his
back
was
slightly
hollowed
his
head
thrown
back
and
both
hands
raised
to
support
the
rustic
cup
there
was
a
loosened
fillet
of
wild
flowers
about
his
head
and
his
eyes
under
their
drooped
lids
looked
straight
into
the
cup
on
the
base
was
scratched
the
greek
word
î
thirst
the
figure
might
have
been
some
beautiful
youth
of
ancient
fable
hylas
or
narcissus
paris
or
endymion
its
beauty
was
the
beauty
of
natural
movement
nothing
had
been
sought
to
be
represented
but
the
perfection
of
an
attitude
this
had
been
most
attentively
studied
and
it
was
exquisitely
rendered
rowland
demanded
more
light
dropped
his
head
on
this
side
and
that
uttered
vague
exclamations
he
said
to
himself
as
he
had
said
more
than
once
in
the
louvre
and
the
vatican
we
ugly
mortals
what
beautiful
creatures
we
are
nothing
in
a
long
time
had
given
him
so
much
pleasure
hudson
hudson
he
asked
again
who
is
hudson
a
young
man
of
this
place
said
cecilia
a
young
man
how
old
i
suppose
he
is
three
or
four
and
of
this
place
you
say
of
northampton
massachusetts
he
lives
here
but
he
comes
from
is
he
a
sculptor
by
profession
he
s
a
rowland
burst
out
laughing
he
has
found
something
in
blackstone
that
i
never
did
he
makes
statues
then
simply
for
his
pleasure
cecilia
with
a
smile
gave
a
little
toss
of
her
head
for
mine
i
congratulate
you
said
rowland
i
wonder
whether
he
could
be
induced
to
do
anything
for
me
this
was
a
matter
of
friendship
i
saw
the
figure
when
he
had
modeled
it
in
clay
and
of
course
greatly
admired
it
he
said
nothing
at
the
time
but
a
week
ago
on
my
birthday
he
arrived
in
a
buggy
with
this
he
had
had
it
cast
at
the
foundry
at
chicopee
i
believe
it
s
a
beautiful
piece
of
bronze
he
begged
me
to
upon
my
word
said
mallet
he
does
things
handsomely
and
he
fell
to
admiring
the
statue
again
so
then
said
cecilia
it
s
very
remarkable
why
my
dear
cousin
rowland
answered
mr
hudson
of
virginia
is
an
extraordinary
then
suddenly
stopping
is
he
a
great
friend
of
yours
he
asked
a
great
friend
and
cecilia
hesitated
i
regard
him
as
a
child
well
said
rowland
he
s
a
very
clever
child
tell
me
something
about
him
i
should
like
to
see
cecilia
was
obliged
to
go
to
her
daughter
s
but
she
assured
rowland
that
she
would
arrange
for
him
a
meeting
with
the
young
sculptor
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
as
he
had
not
called
for
some
days
it
was
likely
he
would
come
that
evening
rowland
left
alone
examined
the
statuette
at
his
leisure
and
returned
more
than
once
during
the
day
to
take
another
look
at
it
he
discovered
its
weak
points
but
it
wore
well
it
had
the
stamp
of
genius
rowland
envied
the
happy
youth
who
in
a
new
england
village
without
aid
or
encouragement
without
models
or
resources
had
found
it
so
easy
to
produce
a
lovely
work
in
the
evening
as
he
was
smoking
his
cigar
on
the
veranda
a
light
quick
step
pressed
the
gravel
of
the
garden
path
and
in
a
moment
a
young
man
made
his
bow
to
cecilia
it
was
rather
a
nod
than
a
bow
and
indicated
either
that
he
was
an
old
friend
or
that
he
was
scantily
versed
in
the
usual
social
forms
cecilia
who
was
sitting
near
the
steps
pointed
to
a
neighboring
chair
but
the
young
man
seated
himself
abruptly
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
began
to
fan
himself
vigorously
with
his
hat
and
broke
out
into
a
lively
objurgation
upon
the
hot
weather
i
m
dripping
wet
he
said
without
ceremony
you
walk
too
fast
said
cecilia
you
do
everything
too
i
know
it
i
know
it
he
cried
passing
his
hand
through
his
abundant
dark
hair
and
making
it
stand
out
in
a
picturesque
shock
i
can
t
be
slow
if
i
try
there
s
something
inside
of
me
that
drives
me
a
restless
fiend
cecilia
gave
a
light
laugh
and
rowland
leaned
forward
in
his
hammock
he
had
placed
himself
in
it
at
bessie
s
request
and
was
playing
that
he
was
her
baby
and
that
she
was
rocking
him
to
sleep
she
sat
beside
him
swinging
the
hammock
to
and
fro
and
singing
a
lullaby
when
he
raised
himself
she
pushed
him
back
and
said
that
the
baby
must
finish
its
nap
but
i
want
to
see
the
gentleman
with
the
fiend
inside
of
him
said
rowland
what
is
a
fiend
bessie
demanded
it
s
only
very
well
i
want
to
see
oh
never
mind
him
said
bessie
with
the
brevity
of
contempt
you
speak
as
if
you
did
n
t
like
i
don
t
bessie
affirmed
and
put
rowland
to
bed
again
the
hammock
was
swung
at
the
end
of
the
veranda
in
the
thickest
shade
of
the
vines
and
this
fragment
of
dialogue
had
passed
unnoticed
rowland
submitted
a
while
longer
to
be
cradled
and
contented
himself
with
listening
to
hudson
s
voice
it
was
a
soft
and
not
altogether
masculine
organ
and
was
pitched
on
this
occasion
in
a
somewhat
plaintive
and
pettish
key
the
young
man
s
mood
seemed
fretful
he
complained
of
the
heat
of
the
dust
of
a
shoe
that
hurt
him
of
having
gone
on
an
errand
a
mile
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
found
the
person
he
was
in
search
of
had
left
northampton
an
hour
before
won
t
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
cecilia
asked
perhaps
that
will
restore
your
aye
by
keeping
me
awake
all
night
said
hudson
at
the
best
it
s
hard
enough
to
go
down
to
the
office
with
my
nerves
set
on
edge
by
a
sleepless
night
i
should
perforce
stay
at
home
and
be
brutal
to
my
poor
your
mother
is
well
i
oh
she
s
as
and
miss
garland
she
s
as
usual
too
every
one
everything
is
as
usual
nothing
ever
happens
in
this
benighted
i
beg
your
pardon
things
do
happen
sometimes
said
cecilia
here
is
a
dear
cousin
of
mine
arrived
on
purpose
to
congratulate
you
on
your
and
she
called
to
rowland
to
come
and
be
introduced
to
hudson
the
young
man
sprang
up
with
alacrity
and
rowland
coming
forward
to
shake
hands
had
a
good
look
at
him
in
the
light
projected
from
the
parlor
window
something
seemed
to
shine
out
of
hudson
s
face
as
a
warning
against
a
compliment
of
the
idle
unpondered
sort
your
statuette
seems
to
me
very
good
rowland
said
gravely
it
has
given
me
extreme
and
my
cousin
knows
what
is
good
said
cecilia
he
s
a
hudson
smiled
and
stared
a
connoisseur
he
cried
laughing
he
s
the
first
i
ve
ever
seen
let
me
see
what
they
look
like
and
he
drew
rowland
nearer
to
the
light
have
they
all
such
good
heads
as
that
i
should
like
to
model
pray
do
said
cecilia
it
will
keep
him
a
while
he
is
running
off
to
ah
to
europe
hudson
exclaimed
with
a
melancholy
cadence
as
they
sat
down
happy
man
but
the
note
seemed
to
rowland
to
be
struck
rather
at
random
for
he
perceived
no
echo
of
it
in
the
boyish
garrulity
of
his
later
talk
hudson
was
a
tall
slender
young
fellow
with
a
singularly
mobile
and
intelligent
face
rowland
was
struck
at
first
only
with
its
responsive
vivacity
but
in
a
short
time
he
perceived
it
was
remarkably
handsome
the
features
were
admirably
chiseled
and
finished
and
a
frank
smile
played
over
them
as
gracefully
as
a
breeze
among
flowers
the
fault
of
the
young
man
s
whole
structure
was
an
excessive
want
of
breadth
the
forehead
though
it
was
high
and
rounded
was
narrow
the
jaw
and
the
shoulders
were
narrow
and
the
result
was
an
air
of
insufficient
physical
substance
but
mallet
afterwards
learned
that
this
fair
slim
youth
could
draw
indefinitely
upon
a
mysterious
fund
of
nervous
force
which
outlasted
and
outwearied
the
endurance
of
many
a
sturdier
temperament
and
certainly
there
was
life
enough
in
his
eye
to
furnish
an
immortality
it
was
a
generous
dark
gray
eye
in
which
there
came
and
went
a
sort
of
kindling
glow
which
would
have
made
a
ruder
visage
striking
and
which
gave
at
times
to
hudson
s
harmonious
face
an
altogether
extraordinary
beauty
there
was
to
rowland
s
sympathetic
sense
a
slightly
pitiful
disparity
between
the
young
sculptor
s
delicate
countenance
and
the
shabby
gentility
of
his
costume
he
was
dressed
for
a
visit
a
visit
to
a
pretty
woman
he
was
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
a
white
linen
suit
which
had
never
been
remarkable
for
the
felicity
of
its
cut
and
had
now
quite
lost
that
crispness
which
garments
of
this
complexion
can
as
ill
spare
as
the
of
a
theatre
the
radiance
of
the
footlights
he
wore
a
vivid
blue
cravat
passed
through
a
ring
altogether
too
splendid
to
be
valuable
he
pulled
and
twisted
as
he
sat
a
pair
of
yellow
kid
gloves
he
emphasized
his
conversation
with
great
dashes
and
flourishes
of
a
light
and
he
kept
constantly
taking
off
and
putting
on
one
of
those
slouched
sombreros
which
are
the
traditional
property
of
the
virginian
or
carolinian
of
romance
when
this
was
on
he
was
very
picturesque
in
spite
of
his
mock
elegance
and
when
it
was
off
and
he
sat
nursing
it
and
turning
it
about
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
awkward
he
evidently
had
a
natural
relish
for
brilliant
accessories
and
appropriated
what
came
to
his
hand
this
was
visible
in
his
talk
which
abounded
in
the
florid
and
sonorous
he
liked
words
with
color
in
them
rowland
who
was
but
a
moderate
talker
sat
by
in
silence
while
cecilia
who
had
told
him
that
she
desired
his
opinion
upon
her
friend
used
a
good
deal
of
characteristic
finesse
in
leading
the
young
man
to
expose
himself
she
perfectly
succeeded
and
hudson
rattled
away
for
an
hour
with
a
volubility
in
which
boyish
unconsciousness
and
manly
shrewdness
were
singularly
combined
he
gave
his
opinion
on
twenty
topics
he
opened
up
an
endless
budget
of
local
gossip
he
described
his
repulsive
routine
at
the
office
of
striker
and
spooner
counselors
at
law
and
he
gave
with
great
felicity
and
gusto
an
account
of
the
annual
between
harvard
and
yale
which
he
had
lately
witnessed
at
worcester
he
had
looked
at
the
straining
oarsmen
and
the
swaying
crowd
with
the
eye
of
the
sculptor
rowland
was
a
good
deal
amused
and
not
a
little
interested
whenever
hudson
uttered
some
peculiarly
striking
piece
of
youthful
grandiloquence
cecilia
broke
into
a
long
light
familiar
laugh
what
are
you
laughing
at
the
young
man
then
demanded
have
i
said
anything
so
ridiculous
go
on
go
on
cecilia
replied
you
are
too
delicious
show
mallet
how
striker
read
the
declaration
of
hudson
like
most
men
with
a
turn
for
the
plastic
arts
was
an
excellent
mimic
and
he
represented
with
a
great
deal
of
humor
the
accent
and
attitude
of
a
pompous
country
lawyer
sustaining
the
burden
of
this
customary
episode
of
our
national
festival
the
sonorous
twang
the
gestures
the
odd
pronunciation
were
vividly
depicted
but
cecilia
s
manner
and
the
young
man
s
quick
response
ruffled
a
little
poor
rowland
s
paternal
conscience
he
wondered
whether
his
cousin
was
not
sacrificing
the
faculty
of
reverence
in
her
clever
protege
to
her
need
for
amusement
hudson
made
no
serious
rejoinder
to
rowland
s
compliment
on
his
statuette
until
he
rose
to
go
rowland
wondered
whether
he
had
forgotten
it
and
supposed
that
the
oversight
was
a
sign
of
the
natural
of
genius
but
hudson
stood
a
moment
before
he
said
good
night
twirled
his
sombrero
and
hesitated
for
the
first
time
he
gave
rowland
a
clear
penetrating
glance
and
then
with
a
wonderfully
frank
appealing
smile
you
really
meant
he
asked
what
you
said
a
while
ago
about
that
thing
of
mine
it
is
good
essentially
good
i
really
meant
it
said
rowland
laying
a
kindly
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
is
very
good
indeed
it
is
as
you
say
essentially
good
that
is
the
beauty
of
hudson
s
eyes
glowed
and
expanded
he
looked
at
rowland
for
some
time
in
silence
i
have
a
notion
you
really
know
he
said
at
last
but
if
you
don
t
it
does
n
t
much
my
cousin
asked
me
said
cecilia
whether
i
supposed
you
knew
yourself
how
good
it
hudson
stared
blushing
a
little
perhaps
not
he
cried
very
likely
said
mallet
i
read
in
a
book
the
other
day
that
great
talent
in
action
in
fact
the
book
said
genius
is
a
kind
of
somnambulism
the
artist
performs
great
feats
in
a
dream
we
must
not
wake
him
up
lest
he
should
lose
his
oh
when
he
s
back
in
bed
again
hudson
answered
with
a
laugh
yes
call
it
a
dream
it
was
a
very
happy
one
tell
me
this
said
rowland
did
you
mean
anything
by
your
young
does
he
represent
an
idea
is
he
a
symbol
hudson
raised
his
eyebrows
and
gently
scratched
his
head
why
he
s
youth
you
know
he
s
innocence
he
s
health
he
s
strength
he
s
curiosity
yes
he
s
a
good
many
and
is
the
cup
also
a
symbol
the
cup
is
knowledge
pleasure
experience
anything
of
that
kind
well
he
s
guzzling
in
earnest
said
rowland
hudson
gave
a
vigorous
nod
aye
poor
fellow
he
s
thirsty
and
on
this
he
cried
good
night
and
bounded
down
the
garden
path
well
what
do
you
make
of
him
asked
cecilia
returning
a
short
time
afterwards
from
a
visit
of
investigation
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
bessie
s
bedclothes
i
confess
i
like
him
said
rowland
he
s
very
immature
but
there
s
stuff
in
he
s
a
strange
being
said
cecilia
musingly
who
are
his
people
what
has
been
his
education
rowland
asked
he
has
had
no
education
beyond
what
he
has
picked
up
with
little
trouble
for
himself
his
mother
is
a
widow
of
a
massachusetts
country
family
a
little
timid
tremulous
woman
who
is
always
on
pins
and
needles
about
her
son
she
had
some
property
herself
and
married
a
virginian
gentleman
of
good
estates
he
turned
out
i
believe
a
very
licentious
personage
and
made
great
havoc
in
their
fortune
everything
or
almost
everything
melted
away
including
hudson
himself
this
is
literally
true
for
he
drank
himself
to
death
ten
years
ago
his
wife
was
left
a
widow
with
scanty
means
and
a
couple
of
growing
boys
she
paid
her
husband
s
debts
as
best
she
could
and
came
to
establish
herself
here
where
by
the
death
of
a
charitable
relative
she
had
inherited
an
ruinous
house
roderick
our
friend
was
her
pride
and
joy
but
stephen
the
elder
was
her
comfort
and
support
i
remember
him
later
he
was
an
ugly
sturdy
practical
lad
very
different
from
his
brother
and
in
his
way
i
imagine
a
very
fine
fellow
when
the
war
broke
out
he
found
that
the
new
england
blood
ran
thicker
in
his
veins
than
the
virginian
and
immediately
obtained
a
commission
he
fell
in
some
western
battle
and
left
his
mother
inconsolable
roderick
however
has
given
her
plenty
to
think
about
and
she
has
induced
him
by
some
mysterious
art
to
abide
nominally
at
least
in
a
profession
that
he
abhors
and
for
which
he
is
about
as
fit
i
should
say
as
i
am
to
drive
a
locomotive
he
grew
up
a
la
grace
de
dieu
and
was
horribly
spoiled
three
or
four
years
ago
he
graduated
at
a
small
college
in
this
neighborhood
where
i
am
afraid
he
had
given
a
good
deal
more
attention
to
novels
and
billiards
than
to
mathematics
and
greek
since
then
he
has
been
reading
law
at
the
rate
of
a
page
a
day
if
he
is
ever
admitted
to
practice
i
m
afraid
my
friendship
won
t
avail
to
make
me
give
him
my
business
good
bad
or
indifferent
the
boy
is
essentially
an
artist
an
artist
to
his
fingers
why
then
asked
rowland
does
n
t
he
deliberately
take
up
the
chisel
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
i
don
t
think
he
more
than
half
suspects
his
talent
the
flame
is
smouldering
but
it
is
never
fanned
by
the
breath
of
criticism
he
sees
nothing
hears
nothing
to
help
him
to
he
s
hopelessly
discontented
but
he
does
n
t
know
where
to
look
for
help
then
his
mother
as
she
one
day
confessed
to
me
has
a
holy
horror
of
a
profession
which
consists
exclusively
as
she
supposes
in
making
figures
of
people
without
their
clothes
on
sculpture
to
her
mind
is
an
insidious
form
of
immorality
and
for
a
young
man
of
a
passionate
disposition
she
considers
the
law
a
much
safer
investment
her
father
was
a
judge
she
has
two
brothers
at
the
bar
and
her
elder
son
had
made
a
very
promising
beginning
in
the
same
line
she
wishes
the
tradition
to
be
perpetuated
i
m
pretty
sure
the
law
won
t
make
roderick
s
fortune
and
i
m
afraid
it
will
in
the
long
run
spoil
his
what
sort
of
a
temper
is
it
one
to
be
trusted
on
the
whole
it
is
quick
but
it
is
generous
i
have
known
it
to
breathe
flame
and
fury
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
soft
sweet
music
early
on
the
morrow
it
s
a
very
entertaining
temper
to
observe
i
fortunately
can
do
so
dispassionately
for
i
m
the
only
person
in
the
place
he
has
not
quarreled
has
he
then
no
society
who
is
miss
garland
whom
you
asked
about
a
young
girl
staying
with
his
mother
a
sort
of
cousin
a
good
plain
girl
but
not
a
person
to
delight
a
sculptor
s
eye
roderick
has
a
goodly
share
of
the
old
southern
arrogance
he
has
the
aristocratic
temperament
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
small
he
says
they
re
he
can
not
endure
his
mother
s
friends
the
old
ladies
and
the
ministers
and
the
people
they
bore
him
to
death
so
he
comes
and
lounges
here
and
rails
at
everything
and
every
this
graceful
young
scoffer
reappeared
a
couple
of
evenings
later
and
confirmed
the
friendly
feeling
he
had
provoked
on
rowland
s
part
he
was
in
an
easier
mood
than
before
he
chattered
less
extravagantly
and
asked
rowland
a
number
of
rather
naif
questions
about
the
condition
of
the
fine
arts
in
new
york
and
boston
cecilia
when
he
had
gone
said
that
this
was
the
wholesome
effect
of
rowland
s
praise
of
his
statuette
roderick
was
acutely
sensitive
and
rowland
s
tranquil
commendation
had
stilled
his
restless
pulses
he
was
ruminating
the
verdict
of
culture
rowland
felt
an
irresistible
kindness
for
him
a
mingled
sense
of
his
personal
charm
and
his
artistic
capacity
he
had
an
indefinable
attraction
the
something
divine
of
unspotted
exuberant
confident
youth
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
rowland
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
long
walk
and
that
roderick
should
show
him
the
country
the
young
man
assented
gleefully
and
in
the
morning
as
rowland
at
the
garden
gate
was
giving
his
hostess
godspeed
on
her
way
to
church
he
came
striding
along
the
grassy
margin
of
the
road
and
the
music
of
the
church
bells
it
was
one
of
those
lovely
days
of
august
when
you
feel
the
complete
exuberance
of
summer
just
warned
and
checked
by
autumn
remember
the
day
and
take
care
you
rob
no
orchards
said
cecilia
as
they
separated
the
young
men
walked
away
at
a
steady
pace
over
hill
and
dale
through
woods
and
fields
and
at
last
found
themselves
on
a
grassy
elevation
studded
with
mossy
rocks
and
red
cedars
just
beneath
them
in
a
great
shining
curve
flowed
the
goodly
connecticut
they
flung
themselves
on
the
grass
and
tossed
stones
into
the
river
they
talked
like
old
friends
rowland
lit
a
cigar
and
roderick
refused
one
with
a
grimace
of
extravagant
disgust
he
thought
them
vile
things
he
did
n
t
see
how
decent
people
could
tolerate
them
rowland
was
amused
and
wondered
what
it
was
that
made
this
speech
seem
perfectly
inoffensive
on
roderick
s
lips
he
belonged
to
the
race
of
mortals
to
be
pitied
or
envied
according
as
we
view
the
matter
who
are
not
held
to
a
strict
account
for
their
aggressions
looking
at
him
as
he
lay
stretched
in
the
shade
rowland
vaguely
likened
him
to
some
beautiful
supple
restless
animal
whose
motions
should
have
no
deeper
warrant
than
the
tremulous
delicacy
of
its
structure
and
be
graceful
even
when
they
were
most
inconvenient
rowland
watched
the
shadows
on
mount
holyoke
listened
to
the
gurgle
of
the
river
and
sniffed
the
balsam
of
the
pines
a
gentle
breeze
had
begun
to
tickle
their
summits
and
brought
the
smell
of
the
mown
grass
across
from
the
river
meadows
he
sat
up
beside
his
companion
and
looked
away
at
the
view
it
seemed
to
him
beautiful
and
suddenly
a
strange
feeling
of
prospective
regret
took
possession
of
him
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
later
in
a
foreign
land
he
would
remember
it
lovingly
and
penitently
it
s
a
wretched
business
he
said
this
practical
quarrel
of
ours
with
our
own
country
this
everlasting
impatience
to
get
out
of
it
is
one
s
only
safety
then
in
flight
this
is
an
american
day
an
american
landscape
an
american
atmosphere
it
certainly
has
its
merits
and
some
day
when
i
am
shivering
with
ague
in
classic
italy
i
shall
accuse
myself
of
having
slighted
roderick
kindled
with
a
sympathetic
glow
and
declared
that
america
was
good
enough
for
him
and
that
he
had
always
thought
it
the
duty
of
an
honest
citizen
to
stand
by
his
own
country
and
help
it
along
he
had
evidently
thought
nothing
whatever
about
it
and
was
launching
his
doctrine
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
the
doctrine
expanded
with
the
occasion
and
he
declared
that
he
was
above
all
an
advocate
for
american
art
he
did
n
t
see
why
we
should
n
t
produce
the
greatest
works
in
the
world
we
were
the
biggest
people
and
we
ought
to
have
the
biggest
conceptions
the
biggest
conceptions
of
course
would
bring
forth
in
time
the
biggest
performances
we
had
only
to
be
true
to
ourselves
to
pitch
in
and
not
be
afraid
to
fling
imitation
overboard
and
fix
our
eyes
upon
our
national
individuality
i
declare
he
cried
there
s
a
career
for
a
man
and
i
ve
twenty
minds
to
decide
on
the
spot
to
embrace
it
to
be
the
consummate
typical
original
national
american
artist
it
s
inspiring
rowland
burst
out
laughing
and
told
him
that
he
liked
his
practice
better
than
his
theory
and
that
a
saner
impulse
than
this
had
inspired
his
little
roderick
took
no
offense
and
three
minutes
afterwards
was
talking
volubly
of
some
humbler
theme
but
half
heeded
by
his
companion
who
had
returned
to
his
cogitations
at
last
rowland
delivered
himself
of
the
upshot
of
these
how
would
you
like
he
suddenly
demanded
to
go
to
rome
hudson
stared
and
with
a
hungry
laugh
which
speedily
consigned
our
national
individuality
to
perdition
responded
that
he
would
like
it
reasonably
well
and
i
should
like
by
the
same
token
he
added
to
go
to
athens
to
constantinople
to
damascus
to
the
holy
city
of
benares
where
there
is
a
golden
statue
of
brahma
twenty
feet
nay
said
rowland
soberly
if
you
were
to
go
to
rome
you
should
settle
down
and
work
athens
might
help
you
but
for
the
present
i
should
n
t
recommend
it
will
be
time
to
arrange
details
when
i
pack
my
trunk
said
hudson
if
you
mean
to
turn
sculptor
the
sooner
you
pack
your
trunk
the
oh
but
i
m
a
practical
man
what
is
the
smallest
sum
per
annum
on
which
one
can
keep
alive
the
sacred
fire
in
rome
what
is
the
largest
sum
at
your
disposal
roderick
stroked
his
light
moustache
gave
it
a
twist
and
then
announced
with
mock
pomposity
three
hundred
dollars
the
money
question
could
be
arranged
said
rowland
there
are
ways
of
raising
i
should
like
to
know
a
few
i
never
yet
discovered
one
consists
said
rowland
in
having
a
friend
with
a
good
deal
more
than
he
wants
and
not
being
too
proud
to
accept
a
part
of
roderick
stared
a
moment
and
his
face
flushed
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
he
stammered
he
was
greatly
excited
rowland
got
up
blushing
a
little
and
roderick
sprang
to
his
feet
in
three
words
if
you
are
to
be
a
sculptor
you
ought
to
go
to
rome
and
study
the
antique
to
go
to
rome
you
need
money
i
m
fond
of
fine
statues
but
unfortunately
i
can
t
make
them
myself
i
have
to
order
them
i
order
a
dozen
from
you
to
be
executed
at
your
convenience
to
help
you
i
pay
you
in
roderick
pushed
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
still
gazing
at
his
companion
you
believe
in
me
he
cried
at
last
allow
me
to
explain
said
rowland
i
believe
in
you
if
you
are
prepared
to
work
and
to
wait
and
to
struggle
and
to
exercise
a
great
many
virtues
and
then
i
m
afraid
to
say
it
lest
i
should
disturb
you
more
than
i
should
help
you
you
must
decide
for
yourself
i
simply
offer
you
an
hudson
stood
for
some
time
profoundly
meditative
you
have
not
seen
my
other
things
he
said
suddenly
come
and
look
at
now
yes
we
ll
walk
home
we
ll
settle
the
he
passed
his
hand
through
rowland
s
arm
and
they
retraced
their
steps
they
reached
the
town
and
made
their
way
along
a
broad
country
street
dusky
with
the
shade
of
magnificent
elms
rowland
felt
his
companion
s
arm
trembling
in
his
own
they
stopped
at
a
large
white
house
flanked
with
melancholy
hemlocks
and
passed
through
a
little
front
garden
paved
with
bricks
and
ornamented
with
parterres
bordered
with
high
box
hedges
the
mansion
had
an
air
of
antiquated
dignity
but
it
had
seen
its
best
days
and
evidently
sheltered
a
shrunken
household
hudson
rowland
was
sure
might
be
seen
in
the
garden
of
a
morning
in
a
white
apron
and
a
pair
of
old
gloves
engaged
in
frugal
horticulture
roderick
s
studio
was
behind
in
the
basement
a
large
empty
room
with
the
paper
peeling
off
the
walls
this
represented
in
the
fashion
of
fifty
years
ago
a
series
of
small
fantastic
landscapes
of
a
hideous
pattern
and
the
young
sculptor
had
presumably
torn
it
away
in
great
scraps
in
moments
of
aesthetic
exasperation
on
a
board
in
a
corner
was
a
heap
of
clay
and
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
stood
some
dozen
medallions
busts
and
figures
in
various
stages
of
completion
to
exhibit
them
roderick
had
to
place
them
one
by
one
on
the
end
of
a
long
which
served
as
a
pedestal
he
did
so
silently
making
no
explanations
and
looking
at
them
himself
with
a
strange
air
of
quickened
curiosity
most
of
the
things
were
portraits
and
the
three
at
which
he
looked
longest
were
finished
busts
one
was
a
colossal
head
of
a
negro
tossed
back
defiant
with
distended
nostrils
one
was
the
portrait
of
a
young
man
whom
rowland
immediately
perceived
by
the
resemblance
to
be
his
deceased
brother
the
last
represented
a
gentleman
with
a
pointed
nose
a
long
shaved
upper
lip
and
a
tuft
on
the
end
of
his
chin
this
was
a
face
peculiarly
unadapted
to
sculpture
but
as
a
piece
of
modeling
it
was
the
best
and
it
was
admirable
it
reminded
rowland
in
its
homely
veracity
its
artless
artfulness
of
the
works
of
the
early
italian
renaissance
on
the
pedestal
was
cut
the
name
barnaby
striker
esq
rowland
remembered
that
this
was
the
appellation
of
the
legal
luminary
from
whom
his
companion
had
undertaken
to
borrow
a
reflected
ray
and
although
in
the
bust
there
was
naught
flagrantly
set
down
in
malice
it
betrayed
comically
to
one
who
could
relish
the
secret
that
the
features
of
the
original
had
often
been
scanned
with
an
irritated
eye
besides
these
there
were
several
rough
studies
of
the
nude
and
two
or
three
figures
of
a
fanciful
kind
the
most
noticeable
and
it
had
singular
beauty
was
a
small
modeled
design
for
a
sepulchral
monument
that
evidently
of
stephen
hudson
the
young
soldier
lay
sleeping
eternally
with
his
hand
on
his
sword
like
an
old
crusader
in
a
gothic
cathedral
rowland
made
no
haste
to
pronounce
too
much
depended
on
his
judgment
upon
my
word
cried
hudson
at
last
they
seem
to
me
very
and
in
truth
as
rowland
looked
he
saw
they
were
good
they
were
youthful
awkward
and
ignorant
the
effort
often
was
more
apparent
than
the
success
but
the
effort
was
signally
powerful
and
intelligent
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
it
needed
only
to
let
itself
go
to
compass
great
things
here
and
there
too
success
when
grasped
had
something
masterly
rowland
turned
to
his
companion
who
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hair
very
much
crumpled
looking
at
him
askance
the
light
of
admiration
was
in
rowland
s
eyes
and
it
speedily
kindled
a
wonderful
illumination
on
hudson
s
handsome
brow
rowland
said
at
last
gravely
you
have
only
to
work
i
think
i
know
what
that
means
roderick
answered
he
turned
away
threw
himself
on
a
rickety
chair
and
sat
for
some
moments
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
work
work
he
said
at
last
looking
up
ah
if
i
could
only
begin
he
glanced
round
the
room
a
moment
and
his
eye
encountered
on
the
the
vivid
physiognomy
of
barnaby
striker
his
smile
vanished
and
he
stared
at
it
with
an
air
of
concentrated
enmity
i
want
to
begin
he
cried
and
i
can
t
make
a
better
beginning
than
this
striker
he
strode
across
the
room
seized
a
mallet
that
lay
at
hand
and
before
rowland
could
interfere
in
the
interest
of
art
if
not
of
morals
dealt
a
merciless
blow
upon
striker
s
skull
the
bust
cracked
into
a
dozen
pieces
which
toppled
with
a
great
crash
upon
the
floor
rowland
relished
neither
the
destruction
of
the
image
nor
his
companion
s
look
in
working
it
but
as
he
was
about
to
express
his
displeasure
the
door
opened
and
gave
passage
to
a
young
girl
she
came
in
with
a
rapid
step
and
startled
face
as
if
she
had
been
summoned
by
the
noise
seeing
the
heap
of
shattered
clay
and
the
mallet
in
roderick
s
hand
she
gave
a
cry
of
horror
her
voice
died
away
when
she
perceived
that
rowland
was
a
stranger
but
she
murmured
reproachfully
why
roderick
what
have
you
done
roderick
gave
a
joyous
kick
to
the
shapeless
fragments
i
ve
driven
the
out
of
the
temple
he
cried
the
traces
retained
shape
enough
to
be
recognized
and
she
gave
a
little
moan
of
pity
she
seemed
not
to
understand
the
young
man
s
allegory
but
yet
to
feel
that
it
pointed
to
some
great
purpose
which
must
be
an
evil
one
from
being
expressed
in
such
a
lawless
fashion
and
to
perceive
that
rowland
was
in
some
way
accountable
for
it
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sharp
frank
mistrust
and
turned
away
through
the
open
door
rowland
looked
after
her
with
extraordinary
interest
chapter
ii
roderick
early
on
the
morrow
rowland
received
a
visit
from
his
new
friend
roderick
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
exhilaration
tempered
however
by
a
certain
amount
of
righteous
wrath
he
had
had
a
domestic
struggle
but
he
had
remained
master
of
the
situation
he
had
shaken
the
dust
of
striker
s
office
from
his
feet
i
had
it
out
last
night
with
my
mother
he
said
i
dreaded
the
scene
for
she
takes
things
terribly
hard
she
does
n
t
scold
nor
storm
and
she
does
n
t
argue
nor
insist
she
sits
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
that
never
fall
and
looks
at
me
when
i
displease
her
as
if
i
were
a
perfect
monster
of
depravity
and
the
trouble
is
that
i
was
born
to
displease
her
she
does
n
t
trust
me
she
never
has
and
she
never
will
i
don
t
know
what
i
have
done
to
set
her
against
me
but
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
have
been
looked
at
with
tears
the
trouble
is
he
went
on
giving
a
twist
to
his
moustache
i
ve
been
too
absurdly
docile
i
ve
been
sprawling
all
my
days
by
the
maternal
fireside
and
my
dear
mother
has
grown
used
to
bullying
me
i
ve
made
myself
cheap
if
i
m
not
in
my
bed
by
eleven
o
clock
the
girl
is
sent
out
to
explore
with
a
lantern
when
i
think
of
it
i
fairly
despise
my
amiability
it
s
rather
a
hard
fate
to
live
like
a
saint
and
to
pass
for
a
sinner
i
should
like
for
six
months
to
lead
hudson
the
life
some
fellows
lead
their
mothers
allow
me
to
believe
said
rowland
that
you
would
like
nothing
of
the
sort
if
you
have
been
a
good
boy
don
t
spoil
it
by
pretending
you
don
t
like
it
you
have
been
very
happy
i
suspect
in
spite
of
your
virtues
and
there
are
worse
fates
in
the
world
than
being
loved
too
well
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
mother
but
i
would
lay
you
a
wager
that
that
is
the
trouble
she
is
passionately
fond
of
you
and
her
hopes
like
all
intense
hopes
keep
trembling
into
rowland
as
he
spoke
had
an
instinctive
vision
of
how
such
a
beautiful
young
fellow
must
be
loved
by
his
female
relatives
roderick
frowned
and
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
do
her
justice
he
cried
may
she
never
do
me
less
then
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
ll
tell
you
the
perfect
truth
he
went
on
i
have
to
fill
a
double
place
i
have
to
be
my
brother
as
well
as
myself
it
s
a
good
deal
to
ask
of
a
man
especially
when
he
has
so
little
talent
as
i
for
being
what
he
is
not
when
we
were
both
young
together
i
was
the
curled
darling
i
had
the
silver
mug
and
the
biggest
piece
of
pudding
and
i
stayed
to
be
kissed
by
the
ladies
while
he
made
in
the
garden
and
was
never
missed
of
course
really
he
was
worth
fifty
of
me
when
he
was
brought
home
from
vicksburg
with
a
piece
of
shell
in
his
skull
my
poor
mother
began
to
think
she
had
n
t
loved
him
enough
i
remember
as
she
hung
round
my
neck
sobbing
before
his
coffin
she
told
me
that
i
must
be
to
her
everything
that
he
would
have
been
i
swore
in
tears
and
in
perfect
good
faith
that
i
would
but
naturally
i
have
not
kept
my
promise
i
have
been
utterly
different
i
have
been
idle
restless
egotistical
discontented
i
have
done
no
harm
i
believe
but
i
have
done
no
good
my
brother
if
he
had
lived
would
have
made
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
put
gas
and
water
into
the
house
my
mother
brooding
night
and
day
on
her
bereavement
has
come
to
fix
her
ideal
in
offices
of
that
sort
judged
by
that
standard
i
m
nowhere
rowland
was
at
loss
how
to
receive
this
account
of
his
friend
s
domestic
circumstances
it
was
plaintive
and
yet
the
manner
seemed
to
him
you
must
lose
no
time
in
making
a
masterpiece
he
answered
then
with
the
proceeds
you
can
give
her
gas
from
golden
so
i
have
told
her
but
she
only
half
believes
either
in
masterpiece
or
in
proceeds
she
can
see
no
good
in
my
making
statues
they
seem
to
her
a
snare
of
the
enemy
she
would
fain
see
me
all
my
life
tethered
to
the
law
like
a
browsing
goat
to
a
stake
in
that
way
i
m
in
sight
it
s
a
more
regular
occupation
that
s
all
i
can
get
out
of
her
a
more
regular
damnation
is
it
a
fact
that
artists
in
general
are
such
wicked
men
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
one
so
i
could
n
t
confute
her
with
an
example
she
had
the
advantage
of
me
because
she
formerly
knew
a
at
richmond
who
did
her
miniature
in
black
lace
mittens
you
may
see
it
on
the
parlor
table
who
used
to
drink
raw
brandy
and
beat
his
wife
i
promised
her
that
whatever
i
might
do
to
my
wife
i
would
never
beat
my
mother
and
that
as
for
brandy
raw
or
diluted
i
detested
it
she
sat
silently
crying
for
an
hour
during
which
i
expended
treasures
of
eloquence
it
s
a
good
thing
to
have
to
reckon
up
one
s
intentions
and
i
assure
you
as
i
pleaded
my
cause
i
was
most
agreeably
impressed
with
the
elevated
character
of
my
own
i
kissed
her
solemnly
at
last
and
told
her
that
i
had
said
everything
and
that
she
must
make
the
best
of
it
this
morning
she
has
dried
her
eyes
but
i
warrant
you
it
is
n
t
a
cheerful
house
i
long
to
be
out
of
it
i
m
extremely
sorry
said
rowland
to
have
been
the
prime
cause
of
so
much
suffering
i
owe
your
mother
some
amends
will
it
be
possible
for
me
to
see
her
if
you
ll
see
her
it
will
smooth
matters
vastly
though
to
tell
the
truth
she
ll
need
all
her
courage
to
face
you
for
she
considers
you
an
agent
of
the
foul
fiend
she
does
n
t
see
why
you
should
have
come
here
and
set
me
by
the
ears
you
are
made
to
ruin
ingenuous
youths
and
desolate
doting
mothers
i
leave
it
to
you
personally
to
answer
these
charges
you
see
what
she
can
t
forgive
what
she
ll
not
really
ever
forgive
is
your
taking
me
off
to
rome
rome
is
an
evil
word
in
my
mother
s
vocabulary
to
be
said
in
a
whisper
as
you
d
say
northampton
is
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
rome
far
away
in
outlying
dusk
into
which
it
can
do
no
christian
any
good
to
penetrate
and
there
was
i
but
yesterday
a
doomed
habitue
of
that
repository
of
every
virtue
striker
s
office
and
does
striker
know
of
your
decision
asked
rowland
to
a
certainty
striker
you
must
know
is
not
simply
a
attorney
who
lets
me
dog
his
he
s
a
particular
friend
and
general
adviser
he
looks
after
my
mother
s
property
and
kindly
consents
to
regard
me
as
part
of
it
our
opinions
have
always
been
painfully
divergent
but
i
freely
forgive
him
his
zealous
attempts
to
unscrew
my
and
set
it
on
hind
part
before
he
never
understood
me
and
it
was
useless
to
try
to
make
him
we
speak
a
different
language
we
re
made
of
a
different
clay
i
had
a
fit
of
rage
yesterday
when
i
smashed
his
bust
at
the
thought
of
all
the
bad
blood
he
had
stirred
up
in
me
it
did
me
good
and
it
s
all
over
now
i
don
t
hate
him
any
more
i
m
rather
sorry
for
him
see
how
you
ve
improved
me
i
must
have
seemed
to
him
wilfully
wickedly
stupid
and
i
m
sure
he
only
tolerated
me
on
account
of
his
great
regard
for
my
mother
this
morning
i
grasped
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
took
an
armful
of
that
have
been
gathering
the
dust
in
my
room
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
and
presented
myself
at
the
office
allow
me
to
put
these
back
in
their
places
i
said
i
shall
never
have
need
for
them
more
never
more
never
more
never
more
so
you
ve
learned
everything
they
contain
asked
striker
leering
over
his
spectacles
better
late
than
i
ve
learned
nothing
that
you
can
teach
me
i
cried
but
i
shall
tax
your
patience
no
longer
i
m
going
to
be
a
sculptor
i
m
going
to
rome
i
won
t
bid
you
just
yet
i
shall
see
you
again
but
i
bid
here
with
rapture
to
these
four
detested
walls
to
this
living
tomb
i
did
n
t
know
till
now
how
i
hated
it
my
compliments
to
spooner
and
my
thanks
for
all
you
have
not
made
of
me
i
m
glad
to
know
you
are
to
see
striker
again
rowland
answered
correcting
a
primary
inclination
to
smile
you
certainly
owe
him
a
respectful
farewell
even
if
he
has
not
understood
you
i
confess
you
rather
puzzle
me
there
is
another
person
he
presently
added
whose
opinion
as
to
your
new
career
i
should
like
to
know
what
does
miss
garland
think
hudson
looked
at
him
keenly
with
a
slight
blush
then
with
a
conscious
smile
what
makes
you
suppose
she
thinks
anything
he
asked
because
though
i
saw
her
but
for
a
moment
yesterday
she
struck
me
as
a
very
intelligent
person
and
i
am
sure
she
has
the
smile
on
roderick
s
mobile
face
passed
rapidly
into
a
frown
oh
she
thinks
what
i
think
he
answered
before
the
two
young
men
separated
rowland
attempted
to
give
as
harmonious
a
shape
as
possible
to
his
companion
s
scheme
i
have
launched
you
as
i
may
say
he
said
and
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
see
you
into
port
i
am
older
than
you
and
know
the
world
better
and
it
seems
well
that
we
should
voyage
a
while
together
it
s
on
my
conscience
that
i
ought
to
take
you
to
rome
walk
you
through
the
vatican
and
then
lock
you
up
with
a
heap
of
clay
i
sail
on
the
fifth
of
september
can
you
make
your
preparations
to
start
with
me
roderick
assented
to
all
this
with
an
air
of
candid
confidence
in
his
friend
s
wisdom
that
outshone
the
virtue
of
pledges
i
have
no
preparations
to
make
he
said
with
a
smile
raising
his
arms
and
letting
them
fall
as
if
to
indicate
his
unencumbered
condition
what
i
am
to
take
with
me
i
carry
here
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
happy
man
murmured
rowland
with
a
sigh
thinking
of
the
light
stowage
in
his
own
organism
in
the
region
indicated
by
roderick
and
of
the
heavy
one
in
deposit
at
his
banker
s
of
bags
and
boxes
when
his
companion
had
left
him
he
went
in
search
of
cecilia
she
was
sitting
at
work
at
a
shady
window
and
welcomed
him
to
a
low
chair
he
sat
some
time
thoughtfully
snipping
tape
with
her
scissors
he
expected
criticism
and
he
was
preparing
a
rejoinder
at
last
he
told
her
of
roderick
s
decision
and
of
his
own
influence
in
it
cecilia
besides
an
extreme
surprise
exhibited
a
certain
fine
displeasure
at
his
not
having
asked
her
advice
what
would
you
have
said
if
i
had
he
demanded
i
would
have
said
in
the
first
place
oh
for
pity
s
sake
don
t
carry
off
the
person
in
all
northampton
who
amuses
me
most
i
would
have
said
in
the
second
place
nonsense
the
boy
is
doing
very
well
let
well
alone
that
in
the
first
five
minutes
what
would
you
have
said
later
that
for
a
man
who
is
generally
averse
to
meddling
you
were
suddenly
rather
rowland
s
countenance
fell
he
frowned
in
silence
cecilia
looked
at
him
askance
gradually
the
spark
of
irritation
faded
from
her
eye
excuse
my
sharpness
she
resumed
at
last
but
i
am
literally
in
despair
at
losing
roderick
hudson
his
visits
in
the
evening
for
the
past
year
have
kept
me
alive
they
have
given
a
silver
tip
to
leaden
days
i
don
t
say
he
is
of
a
more
useful
metal
than
other
people
but
he
is
of
a
different
one
of
course
however
that
i
shall
miss
him
sadly
is
not
a
reason
for
his
not
going
to
seek
his
fortune
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
decidedly
not
said
rowland
with
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
he
had
suspected
from
the
first
hour
of
his
stay
that
cecilia
had
treated
herself
to
a
private
social
luxury
he
had
then
discovered
that
she
found
it
in
hudson
s
lounging
visits
and
boyish
chatter
and
he
had
felt
himself
wondering
at
last
whether
judiciously
viewed
her
gain
in
the
matter
was
not
the
young
man
s
loss
it
was
evident
that
cecilia
was
not
judicious
and
that
her
good
sense
habitually
rigid
under
the
demands
of
domestic
economy
indulged
itself
with
a
certain
agreeable
laxity
on
this
particular
point
she
liked
her
young
friend
just
as
he
was
she
humored
him
flattered
him
laughed
at
him
caressed
him
did
everything
but
advise
him
it
was
a
flirtation
without
the
benefits
of
a
flirtation
she
was
too
old
to
let
him
fall
in
love
with
her
which
might
have
done
him
good
and
her
inclination
was
to
keep
him
young
so
that
the
nonsense
he
talked
might
never
transgress
a
certain
line
it
was
quite
conceivable
that
poor
cecilia
should
relish
a
pastime
but
if
one
had
philanthropically
embraced
the
idea
that
something
considerable
might
be
made
of
roderick
it
was
impossible
not
to
see
that
her
friendship
was
not
what
might
be
called
tonic
so
rowland
reflected
in
the
glow
of
his
sympathy
there
was
a
later
time
when
he
would
have
been
grateful
if
hudson
s
susceptibility
to
the
relaxing
influence
of
lovely
women
might
have
been
limited
to
such
inexpensive
tribute
as
he
rendered
the
excellent
cecilia
i
only
desire
to
remind
you
she
pursued
that
you
are
likely
to
have
your
hands
i
ve
thought
of
that
and
i
rather
like
the
idea
liking
as
i
do
the
man
i
told
you
the
other
day
you
know
that
i
longed
to
have
something
on
my
hands
when
it
first
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
start
our
young
friend
on
the
path
of
glory
i
felt
as
if
i
had
an
unimpeachable
inspiration
then
i
remembered
there
were
dangers
and
difficulties
and
asked
myself
whether
i
had
a
right
to
step
in
between
him
and
his
obscurity
my
sense
of
his
really
having
the
divine
flame
answered
the
question
he
is
made
to
do
the
things
that
humanity
is
the
happier
for
i
can
t
do
such
things
myself
but
when
i
see
a
young
man
of
genius
standing
helpless
and
hopeless
for
want
of
capital
i
feel
and
it
s
no
affectation
of
humility
i
assure
you
as
if
it
would
give
at
least
a
reflected
usefulness
to
my
own
life
to
offer
him
his
in
the
name
of
humanity
i
suppose
i
ought
to
thank
you
but
i
want
first
of
all
to
be
happy
myself
you
guarantee
us
at
any
rate
i
hope
the
a
masterpiece
a
year
said
rowland
smiling
for
the
next
quarter
of
a
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
a
right
to
ask
more
to
demand
that
you
guarantee
us
not
only
the
development
of
the
artist
but
the
security
of
the
rowland
became
grave
again
his
security
his
moral
his
sentimental
security
here
you
see
it
s
perfect
we
are
all
under
a
tacit
compact
to
preserve
it
perhaps
you
believe
in
the
necessary
turbulence
of
genius
and
you
intend
to
enjoin
upon
your
protege
the
importance
of
cultivating
his
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
a
man
of
genius
owes
as
much
deference
to
his
passions
as
any
other
man
but
not
a
particle
more
and
i
confess
i
have
a
strong
conviction
that
the
artist
is
better
for
leading
a
quiet
life
that
is
what
i
shall
preach
to
my
protege
as
you
call
him
by
example
as
well
as
by
precept
you
evidently
believe
he
added
in
a
moment
that
he
will
lead
me
a
nay
i
prophesy
nothing
i
only
think
that
circumstances
with
our
young
man
have
a
great
influence
as
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
although
he
has
been
fuming
and
fretting
here
for
the
last
five
years
he
has
nevertheless
managed
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
found
it
easy
on
the
whole
to
vegetate
transplanted
to
rome
i
fancy
he
ll
put
forth
a
denser
leafage
i
should
like
vastly
to
see
the
change
you
must
write
me
about
it
from
stage
to
stage
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
the
fruit
will
be
proportionate
to
the
foliage
don
t
think
me
a
bird
of
ill
omen
only
remember
that
you
will
be
held
to
a
strict
a
man
should
make
the
most
of
himself
and
be
helped
if
he
needs
help
rowland
answered
after
a
long
pause
of
course
when
a
body
begins
to
expand
there
comes
in
the
possibility
of
bursting
but
i
nevertheless
approve
of
a
certain
tension
of
one
s
being
it
s
what
a
man
is
meant
for
and
then
i
believe
in
the
essential
salubrity
of
genius
true
very
good
said
cecilia
with
an
air
of
resignation
which
made
rowland
for
the
moment
seem
to
himself
culpably
eager
we
ll
drink
then
at
dinner
to
the
health
of
our
having
it
much
at
heart
to
convince
hudson
of
the
purity
of
his
intentions
rowland
waited
upon
her
that
evening
he
was
ushered
into
a
large
parlor
which
by
the
light
of
a
couple
of
candles
he
perceived
to
be
very
meagrely
furnished
and
very
tenderly
and
sparingly
used
the
windows
were
open
to
the
air
of
the
summer
night
and
a
circle
of
three
persons
was
temporarily
awed
into
silence
by
his
appearance
one
of
these
was
hudson
who
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
windows
save
for
the
in
her
lap
which
was
held
with
an
air
of
familiarity
with
its
sadder
uses
near
her
on
the
sofa
half
sitting
half
lounging
in
the
attitude
of
a
visitor
outstaying
ceremony
with
one
long
leg
flung
over
the
other
and
a
large
foot
in
a
clumsy
boot
swinging
to
and
fro
continually
was
a
lean
gentleman
whom
rowland
recognized
as
the
original
of
the
portrait
of
barnaby
striker
at
the
table
near
the
candles
busy
with
a
substantial
piece
of
sat
the
young
girl
of
whom
he
had
had
a
moment
s
quickened
glimpse
in
roderick
s
studio
and
whom
he
had
learned
to
be
miss
garland
his
companion
s
kinswoman
this
young
lady
s
limpid
penetrating
gaze
was
the
most
effective
greeting
he
received
hudson
rose
with
a
soft
vague
sound
of
distress
and
stood
looking
at
him
shrinkingly
and
waveringly
as
if
she
were
sorely
tempted
to
retreat
through
the
open
window
striker
swung
his
long
leg
a
trifle
defiantly
no
one
evidently
was
used
to
offering
hollow
welcomes
or
telling
polite
fibs
rowland
introduced
himself
he
had
come
he
might
say
upon
business
yes
said
hudson
tremulously
i
know
my
son
has
told
me
i
suppose
it
is
better
i
should
see
you
perhaps
you
will
take
a
with
this
invitation
rowland
prepared
to
comply
and
turning
grasped
the
first
chair
that
offered
itself
not
that
one
said
a
full
grave
voice
whereupon
he
perceived
that
a
quantity
of
had
been
suspended
and
entangled
over
the
back
preparatory
to
being
wound
on
reels
he
felt
the
least
bit
irritated
at
the
curtness
of
the
warning
coming
as
it
did
from
a
young
woman
whose
countenance
he
had
mentally
pronounced
interesting
and
with
regard
to
whom
he
was
conscious
of
the
germ
of
the
inevitable
desire
to
produce
a
responsive
interest
and
then
he
thought
it
would
break
the
ice
to
say
something
playfully
urbane
oh
you
should
let
me
take
the
chair
he
answered
and
have
the
pleasure
of
holding
the
skeins
myself
for
all
reply
to
this
sally
he
received
a
stare
of
undisguised
amazement
from
miss
garland
who
then
looked
across
at
hudson
with
a
glance
which
plainly
said
you
see
he
s
quite
the
insidious
personage
we
the
elder
lady
however
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
her
two
hands
tightly
clasped
but
touching
her
rowland
felt
much
more
compassion
than
resentment
her
attitude
was
not
coldness
it
was
a
kind
of
dread
almost
a
terror
she
was
a
small
eager
woman
with
a
pale
troubled
face
which
added
to
her
apparent
age
after
looking
at
her
for
some
minutes
rowland
saw
that
she
was
still
young
and
that
she
must
have
been
a
very
girlish
bride
she
had
been
a
pretty
one
too
though
she
probably
had
looked
terribly
frightened
at
the
altar
she
was
very
delicately
made
and
roderick
had
come
honestly
by
his
physical
slimness
and
elegance
she
wore
no
cap
and
her
flaxen
hair
which
was
of
extraordinary
fineness
was
smoothed
and
confined
with
puritanic
precision
she
was
excessively
shy
and
evidently
very
it
was
singular
to
see
a
woman
to
whom
the
experience
of
life
had
conveyed
so
little
reassurance
as
to
her
own
resources
or
the
chances
of
things
turning
out
well
rowland
began
immediately
to
like
her
and
to
feel
impatient
to
persuade
her
that
there
was
no
harm
in
him
and
that
twenty
to
one
her
son
would
make
her
a
woman
yet
he
foresaw
that
she
would
be
easy
to
persuade
and
that
a
benevolent
conversational
tone
would
probably
make
her
pass
fluttering
from
distrust
into
an
oppressive
extreme
of
confidence
but
he
had
an
indefinable
sense
that
the
person
who
was
testing
that
strong
young
eyesight
of
hers
in
the
dim
was
less
readily
beguiled
from
her
mysterious
feminine
preconceptions
miss
garland
according
to
cecilia
s
judgment
as
rowland
remembered
had
not
a
countenance
to
inspire
a
sculptor
but
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
her
countenance
might
fairly
inspire
a
man
who
was
far
from
being
a
sculptor
she
was
not
pretty
as
the
eye
of
habit
judges
prettiness
but
when
you
made
the
observation
you
somehow
failed
to
set
it
down
against
her
for
you
had
already
passed
from
measuring
contours
to
tracing
meanings
in
mary
garland
s
face
there
were
many
possible
ones
and
they
gave
you
the
more
to
think
about
that
it
was
not
like
roderick
hudson
s
for
instance
a
quick
and
mobile
face
over
which
expression
flickered
like
a
candle
in
a
wind
they
followed
each
other
slowly
distinctly
gravely
sincerely
and
you
might
almost
have
fancied
that
as
they
came
and
went
they
gave
her
a
sort
of
pain
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
had
an
air
of
maidenly
strength
and
decision
she
had
a
broad
forehead
and
dark
eyebrows
a
trifle
thicker
than
those
of
classic
beauties
her
gray
eye
was
clear
but
not
brilliant
and
her
features
were
perfectly
irregular
her
mouth
was
large
fortunately
for
the
principal
grace
of
her
physiognomy
was
her
smile
which
displayed
itself
with
magnificent
amplitude
rowland
indeed
had
not
yet
seen
her
smile
but
something
assured
him
that
her
rigid
gravity
had
a
radiant
counterpart
she
wore
a
scanty
white
dress
and
had
a
nameless
rustic
air
which
would
have
led
one
to
speak
of
her
less
as
a
young
lady
than
as
a
young
woman
she
was
evidently
a
girl
of
a
great
personal
force
but
she
lacked
pliancy
she
was
hemming
a
kitchen
towel
with
the
aid
of
a
large
steel
thimble
she
bent
her
serious
eyes
at
last
on
her
work
again
and
let
rowland
explain
himself
i
have
become
suddenly
so
very
intimate
with
your
son
he
said
at
last
addressing
himself
to
hudson
that
it
seems
just
i
should
make
your
very
just
murmured
the
poor
lady
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
was
on
the
point
of
adding
something
more
but
striker
here
interposed
after
a
prefatory
clearance
of
the
throat
i
should
like
to
take
the
liberty
he
said
of
addressing
you
a
simple
question
for
how
long
a
period
of
time
have
you
been
acquainted
with
our
young
friend
he
continued
to
kick
the
air
but
his
head
was
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
wall
as
if
in
aversion
to
the
spectacle
of
rowland
s
inevitable
confusion
a
very
short
time
i
confess
hardly
three
and
yet
you
call
yourself
intimate
eh
i
have
been
seeing
roderick
daily
these
three
years
and
yet
it
was
only
this
morning
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
at
last
the
right
to
say
that
i
knew
him
we
had
a
few
moments
conversation
in
my
office
which
supplied
the
missing
links
in
the
evidence
so
that
now
i
do
venture
to
say
i
m
acquainted
with
roderick
but
wait
three
years
sir
like
me
and
striker
laughed
with
a
closed
mouth
and
a
noiseless
shake
of
all
his
long
person
hudson
smiled
confusedly
at
hazard
miss
garland
kept
her
eyes
on
her
stitches
but
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
the
latter
colored
a
little
oh
in
three
years
of
course
he
said
we
shall
know
each
other
better
before
many
years
are
over
madam
he
pursued
i
expect
the
world
to
know
him
i
expect
him
to
be
a
great
man
hudson
looked
at
first
as
if
this
could
be
but
an
insidious
device
for
increasing
her
distress
by
the
assistance
of
irony
then
reassured
little
by
little
by
rowland
s
benevolent
visage
she
gave
him
an
appealing
glance
and
a
timorous
really
but
before
rowland
could
respond
striker
again
intervened
do
i
fully
apprehend
your
expression
he
asked
our
young
friend
is
to
become
a
great
man
a
great
artist
i
hope
said
rowland
this
is
a
new
and
interesting
view
said
striker
with
an
assumption
of
judicial
calmness
we
have
had
hopes
for
roderick
but
i
confess
if
i
have
rightly
understood
them
they
stopped
short
of
greatness
we
should
n
t
have
taken
the
responsibility
of
claiming
it
for
him
what
do
you
say
ladies
we
all
feel
about
him
here
his
mother
miss
garland
and
myself
as
if
his
merits
were
rather
in
the
line
of
the
and
striker
waved
his
hand
with
a
series
of
fantastic
flourishes
in
the
air
of
the
light
ornamental
striker
bore
his
recalcitrant
pupil
a
grudge
but
he
was
evidently
trying
both
to
be
fair
and
to
respect
the
susceptibilities
of
his
companions
but
he
was
unversed
in
the
mysterious
processes
of
feminine
emotion
ten
minutes
before
there
had
been
a
general
harmony
of
sombre
views
but
on
hearing
roderick
s
limitations
thus
distinctly
formulated
to
a
stranger
the
two
ladies
mutely
protested
hudson
uttered
a
short
faint
sigh
and
miss
garland
raised
her
eyes
toward
their
advocate
and
visited
him
with
a
short
cold
glance
i
m
afraid
hudson
rowland
pursued
evading
the
discussion
of
roderick
s
possible
greatness
that
you
don
t
at
all
thank
me
for
stirring
up
your
son
s
ambition
on
a
line
which
leads
him
so
far
from
home
i
suspect
i
have
made
you
my
hudson
covered
her
mouth
with
her
and
looked
painfully
perplexed
between
the
desire
to
confess
the
truth
and
the
fear
of
being
impolite
my
cousin
is
no
one
s
enemy
miss
garland
hereupon
declared
gently
but
with
that
same
fine
deliberateness
with
which
she
had
made
rowland
relax
his
grasp
of
the
chair
does
she
leave
that
to
you
rowland
ventured
to
ask
with
a
smile
we
are
inspired
with
none
but
christian
sentiments
said
striker
miss
garland
perhaps
most
of
all
miss
garland
and
striker
waved
his
hand
again
as
if
to
perform
an
introduction
which
had
been
regrettably
omitted
is
the
daughter
of
a
minister
the
granddaughter
of
a
minister
the
sister
of
a
rowland
bowed
deferentially
and
the
young
girl
went
on
with
her
sewing
with
nothing
apparently
either
of
embarrassment
or
elation
at
the
promulgation
of
these
facts
striker
continued
mrs
hudson
i
see
is
too
deeply
agitated
to
converse
with
you
freely
she
will
allow
me
to
address
you
a
few
questions
would
you
kindly
inform
her
as
exactly
as
possible
just
what
you
propose
to
do
with
her
son
the
poor
lady
fixed
her
eyes
appealingly
on
rowland
s
face
and
seemed
to
say
that
striker
had
spoken
her
desire
though
she
herself
would
have
expressed
it
less
defiantly
but
rowland
saw
in
striker
s
light
blue
eye
shrewd
at
once
and
that
he
had
no
intention
of
defiance
and
that
he
was
simply
pompous
and
conceited
and
sarcastically
compassionate
of
any
view
of
things
in
which
roderick
hudson
was
regarded
in
a
serious
light
do
my
dear
madam
demanded
rowland
i
don
t
propose
to
do
anything
he
must
do
for
himself
i
simply
offer
him
the
chance
he
s
to
study
to
work
hard
i
not
too
hard
please
murmured
hudson
pleadingly
wheeling
about
from
recent
visions
of
dangerous
leisure
he
s
not
very
strong
and
i
m
afraid
the
climate
of
europe
is
very
ah
study
repeated
striker
to
what
line
of
study
is
he
to
direct
his
attention
then
suddenly
with
an
impulse
of
disinterested
curiosity
on
his
own
account
how
do
you
study
sculpture
anyhow
by
looking
at
models
and
imitating
at
models
eh
to
what
kind
of
models
do
you
refer
to
the
antique
in
the
first
ah
the
antique
repeated
striker
with
a
jocose
intonation
do
you
hear
madam
roderick
is
going
off
to
europe
to
learn
to
imitate
the
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
said
hudson
twisting
herself
in
a
sort
of
delicate
anguish
an
antique
as
i
understand
it
the
lawyer
continued
is
an
image
of
a
pagan
deity
with
considerable
dirt
sticking
to
it
and
no
arms
no
nose
and
no
clothing
a
precious
model
certainly
that
s
a
very
good
description
of
many
said
rowland
with
a
laugh
mercy
truly
asked
hudson
borrowing
courage
from
his
urbanity
but
a
sculptor
s
studies
you
intimate
are
not
confined
to
the
antique
striker
resumed
after
he
has
been
looking
three
or
four
years
at
the
objects
i
describe
he
studies
the
living
model
said
rowland
does
it
take
three
or
four
years
asked
hudson
imploringly
that
depends
upon
the
artist
s
aptitude
after
twenty
years
a
real
artist
is
still
oh
my
poor
boy
moaned
hudson
finding
the
prospect
under
every
light
still
terrible
now
this
study
of
the
living
model
striker
pursued
inform
hudson
about
oh
dear
no
cried
hudson
shrinkingly
that
too
said
rowland
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
studying
in
rome
it
s
a
handsome
race
you
know
and
you
find
very
i
suppose
they
re
no
better
made
than
a
good
tough
yankee
objected
striker
transposing
his
interminable
legs
the
same
god
made
surely
sighed
hudson
but
with
a
questioning
glance
at
her
visitor
which
showed
that
she
had
already
begun
to
concede
much
weight
to
his
opinion
rowland
hastened
to
express
his
assent
to
striker
s
proposition
miss
garland
looked
up
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
are
the
roman
women
very
beautiful
she
asked
rowland
too
in
answering
hesitated
he
was
looking
straight
at
the
young
girl
on
the
whole
i
prefer
ours
he
said
she
had
dropped
her
work
in
her
lap
her
hands
were
crossed
upon
it
her
head
thrown
a
little
back
she
had
evidently
expected
a
more
impersonal
answer
and
she
was
dissatisfied
for
an
instant
she
seemed
inclined
to
make
a
rejoinder
but
she
slowly
picked
up
her
work
in
silence
and
drew
her
stitches
again
rowland
had
for
the
second
time
the
feeling
that
she
judged
him
to
be
a
person
of
a
disagreeably
sophisticated
tone
he
noticed
too
that
the
kitchen
towel
she
was
hemming
was
terribly
coarse
and
yet
his
answer
had
a
resonant
inward
echo
and
he
repeated
to
himself
yes
on
the
whole
i
prefer
well
these
models
began
striker
you
put
them
into
an
attitude
i
an
attitude
and
then
you
sit
down
and
look
at
you
must
not
sit
too
long
you
must
go
at
your
clay
and
try
to
build
up
something
that
looks
like
well
there
you
are
with
your
model
in
an
attitude
on
one
side
yourself
in
an
attitude
too
i
suppose
on
the
other
and
your
pile
of
clay
in
the
middle
building
up
as
you
say
so
you
pass
the
morning
after
that
i
hope
you
go
out
and
take
a
walk
and
rest
from
your
unquestionably
but
to
a
sculptor
who
loves
his
work
there
is
no
time
lost
everything
he
looks
at
teaches
or
suggests
that
s
a
tempting
doctrine
to
young
men
with
a
taste
for
sitting
by
the
hour
with
the
page
unturned
watching
the
flies
buzz
or
the
frost
melt
on
the
our
young
friend
in
this
way
must
have
laid
up
stores
of
information
which
i
never
suspected
very
likely
said
rowland
with
an
unresentful
smile
he
will
prove
some
day
the
completer
artist
for
some
of
those
lazy
this
theory
was
apparently
very
grateful
to
hudson
who
had
never
had
the
case
put
for
her
son
with
such
ingenious
hopefulness
and
found
herself
disrelishing
the
singular
situation
of
seeming
to
side
against
her
own
flesh
and
blood
with
a
lawyer
whose
conversational
tone
betrayed
the
habit
of
my
son
then
she
ventured
to
ask
my
son
has
great
what
you
would
call
great
powers
to
my
sense
very
great
poor
hudson
actually
smiled
broadly
gleefully
and
glanced
at
miss
garland
as
if
to
invite
her
to
do
likewise
but
the
young
girl
s
face
remained
serious
like
the
eastern
sky
when
the
opposite
sunset
is
too
feeble
to
make
it
glow
do
you
really
know
she
asked
looking
at
rowland
one
can
not
know
in
such
a
matter
save
after
proof
and
proof
takes
time
but
one
can
and
you
believe
i
but
even
then
miss
garland
vouchsafed
no
smile
her
face
became
graver
than
ever
well
well
said
hudson
we
must
hope
that
it
is
all
for
the
striker
eyed
his
old
friend
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
some
displeasure
he
saw
that
this
was
but
a
cunning
feminine
imitation
of
resignation
and
that
through
some
untraceable
process
of
transition
she
was
now
taking
more
comfort
in
the
opinions
of
this
insinuating
stranger
than
in
his
own
tough
dogmas
he
rose
to
his
feet
without
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
but
with
a
wrinkled
grin
at
the
inconsistency
of
women
well
sir
roderick
s
powers
are
nothing
to
me
he
said
nor
no
use
he
makes
of
them
good
or
bad
he
s
no
son
of
mine
but
in
a
friendly
way
i
m
glad
to
hear
so
fine
an
account
of
him
i
m
glad
madam
you
re
so
satisfied
with
the
prospect
affection
sir
you
see
must
have
its
guarantees
he
paused
a
moment
stroking
his
beard
with
his
head
inclined
and
one
eye
looking
at
rowland
the
look
was
grotesque
but
it
was
significant
and
it
puzzled
rowland
more
than
it
amused
him
i
suppose
you
re
a
very
brilliant
young
man
he
went
on
very
enlightened
very
cultivated
quite
up
to
the
mark
in
the
fine
arts
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
m
a
plain
practical
old
boy
content
to
follow
an
honorable
profession
in
a
free
country
i
did
n
t
go
off
to
the
old
world
to
learn
my
business
no
one
took
me
by
the
hand
i
had
to
grease
my
wheels
myself
and
such
as
i
am
i
m
a
man
every
inch
of
me
well
if
our
young
friend
is
booked
for
fame
and
fortune
i
don
t
suppose
his
going
to
rome
will
stop
him
but
mind
you
it
won
t
help
him
such
a
long
way
either
if
you
have
undertaken
to
put
him
through
there
s
a
thing
or
two
you
d
better
remember
the
crop
we
gather
depends
upon
the
seed
we
sow
he
may
be
the
biggest
genius
of
the
age
his
potatoes
won
t
come
up
without
his
hoeing
them
if
he
takes
things
so
almighty
easy
as
well
as
one
or
two
young
fellows
of
genius
i
ve
had
under
my
eye
his
produce
will
never
gain
the
prize
take
the
word
for
it
of
a
man
who
has
made
his
way
inch
by
inch
and
does
n
t
believe
that
we
ll
wake
up
to
find
our
work
done
because
we
ve
lain
all
night
of
it
anything
worth
doing
is
devilish
hard
to
do
if
your
young
protajay
finds
things
easy
and
has
a
good
time
and
says
he
likes
the
life
it
s
a
sign
that
as
i
may
say
you
had
better
step
round
to
the
office
and
look
at
the
books
that
s
all
i
desire
to
remark
no
offense
intended
i
hope
you
ll
have
a
rowland
could
honestly
reply
that
this
seemed
pregnant
sense
and
he
offered
striker
a
friendly
as
the
latter
withdrew
but
striker
s
rather
grim
view
of
matters
cast
a
momentary
shadow
on
his
companions
and
hudson
seemed
to
feel
that
it
necessitated
between
them
some
little
friendly
agreement
not
to
be
overawed
rowland
sat
for
some
time
longer
partly
because
he
wished
to
please
the
two
women
and
partly
because
he
was
strangely
pleased
himself
there
was
something
touching
in
their
unworldly
fears
and
diffident
hopes
something
almost
terrible
in
the
way
poor
little
hudson
seemed
to
flutter
and
quiver
with
intense
maternal
passion
she
put
forth
one
timid
conversational
venture
after
another
and
asked
rowland
a
number
of
questions
about
himself
his
age
his
family
his
occupations
his
tastes
his
religious
opinions
rowland
had
an
odd
feeling
at
last
that
she
had
begun
to
consider
him
very
exemplary
and
that
she
might
make
later
some
perturbing
discovery
he
tried
therefore
to
invent
something
that
would
prepare
her
to
find
him
fallible
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
it
only
seemed
to
him
that
miss
garland
secretly
mistrusted
him
and
that
he
must
leave
her
to
render
him
the
service
after
he
had
gone
of
making
him
the
object
of
a
little
firm
derogation
hudson
talked
with
eagerness
about
her
son
he
s
very
lovable
sir
i
assure
you
when
you
come
to
know
him
you
ll
find
him
very
lovable
he
s
a
little
spoiled
of
course
he
has
always
done
with
me
as
he
pleased
but
he
s
a
good
boy
i
m
sure
he
s
a
good
boy
and
every
one
thinks
him
very
attractive
i
m
sure
he
d
be
noticed
anywhere
don
t
you
think
he
s
very
handsome
sir
he
features
his
poor
father
i
had
another
perhaps
you
ve
been
told
he
was
and
the
poor
little
lady
bravely
smiled
for
fear
of
doing
worse
he
was
a
very
fine
boy
but
very
different
from
roderick
roderick
is
a
little
strange
he
has
never
been
an
easy
boy
sometimes
i
feel
like
the
goose
was
n
t
it
a
goose
dear
and
startled
by
the
audacity
of
her
comparison
she
appealed
to
miss
garland
the
goose
or
the
hen
who
hatched
a
swan
s
egg
i
have
never
been
able
to
give
him
what
he
needs
i
have
always
thought
that
in
more
in
more
brilliant
circumstances
he
might
find
his
place
and
be
happy
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
afraid
of
the
world
for
him
it
was
so
large
and
dangerous
and
dreadful
no
doubt
i
know
very
little
about
it
i
never
suspected
i
confess
that
it
contained
persons
of
such
liberality
as
rowland
replied
that
evidently
she
had
done
the
world
but
scanty
justice
no
objected
miss
garland
after
a
pause
it
is
like
something
in
a
fairy
what
pray
your
coming
here
all
unknown
so
rich
and
so
polite
and
carrying
off
my
cousin
in
a
golden
if
this
was
badinage
miss
garland
had
the
best
of
it
for
rowland
almost
fell
silently
over
the
question
whether
there
was
a
possibility
of
irony
in
that
transparent
gaze
before
he
withdrew
hudson
made
him
tell
her
again
that
roderick
s
powers
were
extraordinary
he
had
inspired
her
with
a
clinging
caressing
faith
in
his
wisdom
he
will
really
do
great
things
she
asked
the
very
greatest
i
see
no
reason
in
his
talent
itself
why
he
should
well
we
ll
think
of
that
as
we
sit
here
alone
she
rejoined
mary
and
i
will
sit
here
and
talk
about
it
so
i
give
him
up
she
went
on
as
he
was
going
i
m
sure
you
ll
be
the
best
of
friends
to
him
but
if
you
should
ever
forget
him
or
grow
tired
of
him
or
lose
your
interest
in
him
and
he
should
come
to
any
harm
or
any
trouble
please
sir
remember
and
she
paused
with
a
tremulous
voice
remember
my
dear
madam
that
he
is
all
i
have
that
he
is
everything
and
that
it
would
be
very
in
so
far
as
i
can
help
him
he
shall
succeed
was
all
rowland
could
say
he
turned
to
miss
garland
to
bid
her
good
night
and
she
rose
and
put
out
her
hand
she
was
very
straightforward
but
he
could
see
that
if
she
was
too
modest
to
be
bold
she
was
much
too
simple
to
be
shy
have
you
no
charge
to
lay
upon
me
he
asked
to
ask
her
something
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
although
she
was
not
shy
she
blushed
make
him
do
his
best
she
said
rowland
noted
the
soft
intensity
with
which
the
words
were
uttered
do
you
take
a
great
interest
in
him
he
demanded
then
if
he
will
not
do
his
best
for
you
he
will
not
do
it
for
she
turned
away
with
another
blush
and
rowland
took
his
leave
he
walked
homeward
thinking
of
many
things
the
great
northampton
elms
interarched
far
above
in
the
darkness
but
the
moon
had
risen
and
through
scattered
apertures
was
hanging
the
dusky
vault
with
silver
lamps
there
seemed
to
rowland
something
intensely
serious
in
the
scene
in
which
he
had
just
taken
part
he
had
laughed
and
talked
and
braved
it
out
in
but
when
he
reflected
that
he
was
really
meddling
with
the
simple
stillness
of
this
little
new
england
home
and
that
he
had
ventured
to
disturb
so
much
living
security
in
the
interest
of
a
fantastic
hypothesis
he
paused
amazed
at
his
temerity
it
was
true
as
cecilia
had
said
that
for
an
unofficious
man
it
was
a
singular
position
there
stirred
in
his
mind
an
odd
feeling
of
annoyance
with
roderick
for
having
thus
peremptorily
enlisted
his
sympathies
as
he
looked
up
and
down
the
long
vista
and
saw
the
clear
white
houses
glancing
here
and
there
in
the
broken
moonshine
he
could
almost
have
believed
that
the
happiest
lot
for
any
man
was
to
make
the
most
of
life
in
some
such
tranquil
spot
as
that
here
were
kindness
comfort
safety
the
warning
voice
of
duty
the
perfect
hush
of
temptation
and
as
rowland
looked
along
the
arch
of
silvered
shadow
and
out
into
the
lucid
air
of
the
american
night
which
seemed
so
doubly
vast
somehow
and
strange
and
nocturnal
he
felt
like
declaring
that
here
was
beauty
too
beauty
sufficient
for
an
artist
not
to
starve
upon
it
as
he
stood
lost
in
the
darkness
he
presently
heard
a
rapid
tread
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
accompanied
by
a
loud
jubilant
whistle
and
in
a
moment
a
figure
emerged
into
an
open
gap
of
moonshine
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
hudson
who
was
presumably
returning
from
a
visit
to
cecilia
roderick
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
up
at
the
moon
with
his
face
vividly
illumined
he
broke
out
into
a
snatch
of
song
the
splendor
falls
on
castle
walls
and
snowy
summits
old
in
story
and
with
a
great
musical
roll
of
his
voice
he
went
swinging
off
into
the
darkness
again
as
if
his
thoughts
had
lent
him
wings
he
was
dreaming
of
the
inspiration
of
foreign
lands
of
castled
crags
and
historic
landscapes
what
a
pity
after
all
thought
rowland
as
he
went
his
own
way
that
he
should
n
t
have
a
taste
of
it
it
had
been
a
very
just
remark
of
cecilia
s
that
roderick
would
change
with
a
change
in
his
circumstances
rowland
had
telegraphed
to
new
york
for
another
berth
on
his
steamer
and
from
the
hour
the
answer
came
hudson
s
spirits
rose
to
incalculable
heights
he
was
radiant
with
and
his
kindly
jollity
seemed
the
pledge
of
a
brilliant
future
he
had
forgiven
his
old
enemies
and
forgotten
his
old
grievances
and
seemed
every
way
reconciled
to
a
world
in
which
he
was
going
to
count
as
an
active
force
he
was
inexhaustibly
loquacious
and
fantastic
and
as
cecilia
said
he
had
suddenly
become
so
good
that
it
was
only
to
be
feared
he
was
going
to
start
not
for
europe
but
for
heaven
he
took
long
walks
with
rowland
who
felt
more
and
more
the
fascination
of
what
he
would
have
called
his
giftedness
rowland
returned
several
times
to
hudson
s
and
found
the
two
ladies
doing
their
best
to
be
happy
in
their
companion
s
happiness
miss
garland
he
thought
was
succeeding
better
than
her
demeanor
on
his
first
visit
had
promised
he
tried
to
have
some
especial
talk
with
her
but
her
extreme
reserve
forced
him
to
content
himself
with
such
response
to
his
rather
urgent
overtures
as
might
be
extracted
from
a
keenly
attentive
smile
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
if
the
response
was
vague
the
satisfaction
was
great
and
that
rowland
after
his
second
visit
kept
seeing
a
lurking
reflection
of
this
smile
in
the
most
unexpected
places
it
seemed
strange
that
she
should
please
him
so
well
at
so
slender
a
cost
but
please
him
she
did
prodigiously
and
his
pleasure
had
a
quality
altogether
new
to
him
it
made
him
restless
and
a
trifle
melancholy
he
walked
about
absently
wondering
and
wishing
he
wondered
among
other
things
why
fate
should
have
condemned
him
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
girl
whom
he
would
make
a
sacrifice
to
know
better
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
country
for
years
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
turning
his
back
on
a
chance
of
happiness
happiness
of
a
sort
of
which
the
slenderest
germ
should
be
cultivated
he
asked
himself
whether
feeling
as
he
did
if
he
had
only
himself
to
please
he
would
give
up
his
journey
and
wait
he
had
roderick
to
please
now
for
whom
disappointment
would
be
cruel
but
he
said
to
himself
that
certainly
if
there
were
no
roderick
in
the
case
the
ship
should
sail
without
him
he
asked
hudson
several
questions
about
his
cousin
but
roderick
confidential
on
most
points
seemed
to
have
reasons
of
his
own
for
being
reticent
on
this
one
his
measured
answers
quickened
rowland
s
curiosity
for
miss
garland
with
her
own
irritating
had
only
to
be
a
subject
of
guarded
allusion
in
others
to
become
intolerably
interesting
he
learned
from
roderick
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
country
minister
a
cousin
of
his
mother
settled
in
another
part
of
the
state
that
she
was
one
of
a
daughters
that
the
family
was
very
poor
and
that
she
had
come
a
couple
of
months
before
to
pay
his
mother
a
long
visit
it
is
to
be
a
very
long
one
now
he
said
for
it
is
settled
that
she
is
to
remain
while
i
am
the
fermentation
of
contentment
in
roderick
s
soul
reached
its
climax
a
few
days
before
the
young
men
were
to
make
their
farewells
he
had
been
sitting
with
his
friends
on
cecilia
s
veranda
but
for
half
an
hour
past
he
had
said
nothing
lounging
back
against
a
column
and
gazing
idly
at
the
stars
he
kept
caroling
softly
to
himself
with
that
indifference
to
ceremony
for
which
he
always
found
allowance
and
which
in
him
had
a
sort
of
pleading
grace
at
last
springing
up
i
want
to
strike
out
hard
he
exclaimed
i
want
to
do
something
violent
to
let
off
steam
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
this
lovely
weather
said
cecilia
give
a
picnic
it
can
be
as
violent
as
you
please
and
it
will
have
the
merit
of
leading
off
our
emotion
into
a
safe
channel
as
well
as
roderick
laughed
uproariously
at
cecilia
s
very
practical
remedy
for
his
sentimental
need
but
a
couple
of
days
later
nevertheless
the
picnic
was
given
it
was
to
be
a
family
party
but
roderick
in
his
magnanimous
geniality
insisted
on
inviting
striker
a
decision
which
rowland
mentally
applauded
and
we
ll
have
striker
too
he
said
if
she
ll
come
to
keep
my
mother
in
countenance
and
at
any
rate
we
ll
have
miss
striker
the
divine
petronilla
the
young
lady
thus
denominated
formed
with
hudson
miss
garland
and
cecilia
the
feminine
half
of
the
company
striker
presented
himself
sacrificing
a
morning
s
work
with
a
magnanimity
greater
even
than
roderick
s
and
foreign
support
was
further
secured
in
the
person
of
whitefoot
the
young
orthodox
minister
roderick
had
chosen
the
he
knew
it
well
and
had
passed
many
a
summer
afternoon
there
lying
at
his
length
on
the
grass
and
gazing
at
the
blue
undulations
of
the
horizon
it
was
a
meadow
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
with
mossy
rocks
protruding
through
the
grass
and
a
little
lake
on
the
other
side
it
was
a
cloudless
august
day
rowland
always
remembered
it
and
the
scene
and
everything
that
was
said
and
done
with
extraordinary
distinctness
roderick
surpassed
himself
in
friendly
jollity
and
at
one
moment
when
exhilaration
was
at
the
highest
was
seen
in
striker
s
high
white
hat
drinking
champagne
from
a
broken
to
striker
s
health
miss
striker
had
her
father
s
pale
blue
eye
she
was
dressed
as
if
she
were
going
to
sit
for
her
photograph
and
remained
for
a
long
time
with
roderick
on
a
little
promontory
overhanging
the
lake
hudson
sat
all
day
with
a
little
meek
apprehensive
smile
she
was
afraid
of
an
accident
though
unless
miss
striker
who
indeed
was
a
little
of
a
romp
should
push
roderick
into
the
lake
it
was
hard
to
see
what
accident
could
occur
hudson
was
as
neat
and
crisp
and
uncrumpled
at
the
end
of
the
festival
as
at
the
beginning
whitefoot
who
but
a
twelvemonth
later
became
a
convert
to
episcopacy
and
was
already
cultivating
a
certain
conversational
sonority
devoted
himself
to
cecilia
he
had
a
little
book
in
his
pocket
out
of
which
he
read
to
her
at
intervals
lying
stretched
at
her
feet
and
it
was
a
lasting
joke
with
cecilia
afterwards
that
she
would
never
tell
what
whitefoot
s
little
book
had
been
rowland
had
placed
himself
near
miss
garland
while
the
feasting
went
forward
on
the
grass
she
wore
a
gypsy
hat
a
little
straw
hat
tied
down
over
her
ears
so
as
to
cast
her
eyes
into
shadow
by
a
ribbon
passing
outside
of
it
when
the
company
dispersed
after
lunch
he
proposed
to
her
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
wood
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
looked
toward
hudson
as
if
for
permission
to
leave
her
but
hudson
was
listening
to
striker
who
sat
gossiping
to
her
with
relaxed
magniloquence
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
and
his
hat
on
his
nose
you
can
give
your
cousin
your
society
at
any
time
said
rowland
but
me
perhaps
you
ll
never
see
why
then
should
we
wish
to
be
friends
if
nothing
is
to
come
of
it
she
asked
with
homely
logic
but
by
this
time
she
had
consented
and
they
were
treading
the
fallen
oh
one
must
take
all
one
can
get
said
rowland
if
we
can
be
friends
for
half
an
hour
it
s
so
much
do
you
expect
never
to
come
back
to
northampton
again
never
is
a
good
deal
to
say
but
i
go
to
europe
for
a
long
do
you
prefer
it
so
much
to
your
own
country
i
will
not
say
that
but
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
a
rather
idle
man
and
in
europe
the
burden
of
idleness
is
less
heavy
than
she
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
at
last
in
that
then
we
are
better
than
europe
she
said
to
a
certain
point
rowland
agreed
with
her
but
he
demurred
to
make
her
say
more
would
n
t
it
be
better
she
asked
to
work
to
get
reconciled
to
america
than
to
go
to
europe
to
get
reconciled
to
idleness
doubtless
but
you
know
work
is
hard
to
i
come
from
a
little
place
where
every
one
has
plenty
said
miss
garland
we
all
work
every
one
i
know
works
and
really
she
added
presently
i
look
at
you
with
curiosity
you
are
the
first
unoccupied
man
i
ever
don
t
look
at
me
too
hard
said
rowland
smiling
i
shall
sink
into
the
earth
what
is
the
name
of
your
little
place
west
nazareth
said
miss
garland
with
her
usual
sobriety
it
is
not
so
very
little
though
it
s
smaller
than
i
wonder
whether
i
could
find
any
work
at
west
nazareth
rowland
said
you
would
not
like
it
miss
garland
declared
reflectively
though
there
are
far
finer
woods
there
than
this
we
have
miles
and
miles
of
i
might
chop
down
trees
said
rowland
that
is
if
you
allow
allow
it
why
where
should
we
get
our
firewood
then
noticing
that
he
had
spoken
jestingly
she
glanced
at
him
askance
though
with
no
visible
diminution
of
her
gravity
don
t
you
know
how
to
do
anything
have
you
no
profession
rowland
shook
his
head
absolutely
what
do
you
do
all
day
nothing
worth
relating
that
s
why
i
am
going
to
europe
there
at
least
if
i
do
nothing
i
shall
see
a
great
deal
and
if
i
m
not
a
producer
i
shall
at
any
rate
be
an
can
t
we
observe
everywhere
certainly
and
i
really
think
that
in
that
way
i
make
the
most
of
my
opportunities
though
i
confess
he
continued
that
i
often
remember
there
are
things
to
be
seen
here
to
which
i
probably
have
n
t
done
justice
i
should
like
for
instance
to
see
west
she
looked
round
at
him
not
apparently
that
she
exactly
supposed
he
was
jesting
for
the
expression
of
such
a
desire
was
not
necessarily
facetious
but
as
if
he
must
have
spoken
with
an
ulterior
motive
in
fact
he
had
spoken
from
the
simplest
of
motives
the
girl
beside
him
pleased
him
unspeakably
and
suspecting
that
her
charm
was
essentially
her
own
and
not
reflected
from
social
circumstance
he
wished
to
give
himself
the
satisfaction
of
contrasting
her
with
the
meagre
influences
of
her
education
miss
garland
s
second
movement
was
to
take
him
at
his
word
since
you
are
free
to
do
as
you
please
why
don
t
you
go
there
i
am
not
free
to
do
as
i
please
now
i
have
offered
your
cousin
to
bear
him
company
to
europe
he
has
accepted
with
enthusiasm
and
i
can
not
are
you
going
to
europe
simply
for
his
sake
rowland
hesitated
a
moment
i
think
i
may
almost
say
miss
garland
walked
along
in
silence
do
you
mean
to
do
a
great
deal
for
him
she
asked
at
last
what
i
can
but
my
power
of
helping
him
is
very
small
beside
his
power
of
helping
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
again
you
are
very
generous
she
said
almost
solemnly
no
i
am
simply
very
shrewd
roderick
will
repay
me
it
s
an
investment
at
first
i
think
he
added
shortly
afterwards
you
would
not
have
paid
me
that
compliment
you
distrusted
she
made
no
attempt
to
deny
it
i
did
n
t
see
why
you
should
wish
to
make
roderick
discontented
i
thought
you
were
rather
you
did
me
injustice
i
don
t
think
i
m
it
was
because
you
are
unlike
other
men
those
at
least
whom
i
have
in
what
way
why
as
you
describe
yourself
you
have
no
duties
no
profession
no
home
you
live
for
your
that
s
all
very
true
and
yet
i
maintain
i
m
not
i
hope
not
said
miss
garland
simply
they
had
reached
a
point
where
the
forked
and
put
forth
two
divergent
tracks
which
lost
themselves
in
a
verdurous
tangle
miss
garland
seemed
to
think
that
the
difficulty
of
choice
between
them
was
a
reason
for
giving
them
up
and
turning
back
rowland
thought
otherwise
and
detected
agreeable
grounds
for
preference
in
the
path
as
a
compromise
they
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
looking
about
him
rowland
espied
a
curious
wild
shrub
with
a
spotted
crimson
leaf
he
went
and
plucked
a
spray
of
it
and
brought
it
to
miss
garland
he
had
never
observed
it
before
but
she
immediately
called
it
by
its
name
she
expressed
surprise
at
his
not
knowing
it
it
was
extremely
common
he
presently
brought
her
a
specimen
of
another
delicate
plant
with
a
little
flower
i
suppose
that
s
common
too
he
said
but
i
have
never
seen
it
or
noticed
it
at
she
answered
that
this
one
was
rare
and
meditated
a
moment
before
she
could
remember
its
name
at
last
she
recalled
it
and
expressed
surprise
at
his
having
found
the
plant
in
the
woods
she
supposed
it
grew
only
in
open
marshes
rowland
complimented
her
on
her
fund
of
useful
information
it
s
not
especially
useful
she
answered
but
i
like
to
know
the
names
of
plants
as
i
do
those
of
my
acquaintances
when
we
walk
in
the
woods
at
home
which
we
do
so
much
it
seems
as
unnatural
not
to
know
what
to
call
the
flowers
as
it
would
be
to
see
some
one
in
the
town
with
whom
we
were
not
on
speaking
apropos
of
frivolity
rowland
said
i
m
sure
you
have
very
little
of
it
unless
at
west
nazareth
it
is
considered
frivolous
to
walk
in
the
woods
and
nod
to
the
nodding
flowers
do
kindly
tell
me
a
little
about
and
to
compel
her
to
begin
i
know
you
come
of
a
race
of
theologians
he
went
on
no
she
replied
deliberating
they
are
not
theologians
though
they
are
ministers
we
don
t
take
a
very
firm
stand
upon
doctrine
we
are
practical
rather
we
write
sermons
and
preach
them
but
we
do
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
and
of
this
hard
work
what
has
your
share
been
the
hardest
part
doing
what
do
you
call
nothing
i
taught
school
a
while
i
must
make
the
most
of
that
but
i
confess
i
did
n
t
like
it
otherwise
i
have
only
done
little
things
at
home
as
they
turned
what
kind
of
things
oh
every
kind
if
you
had
seen
my
home
you
would
rowland
would
have
liked
to
make
her
specify
but
he
felt
a
more
urgent
need
to
respect
her
simplicity
than
he
had
ever
felt
to
defer
to
the
complex
circumstance
of
certain
other
women
to
be
happy
i
imagine
he
contented
himself
with
saying
you
need
to
be
occupied
you
need
to
have
something
to
expend
yourself
that
is
not
so
true
as
it
once
was
now
that
i
am
older
i
am
sure
i
am
less
impatient
of
leisure
certainly
these
two
months
that
i
have
been
with
hudson
i
have
had
a
terrible
amount
of
it
and
yet
i
have
liked
it
and
now
that
i
am
probably
to
be
with
her
all
the
while
that
her
son
is
away
i
look
forward
to
more
with
a
resignation
that
i
don
t
quite
know
what
to
make
it
is
settled
then
that
you
are
to
remain
with
your
cousin
it
depends
upon
their
writing
from
home
that
i
may
stay
but
that
is
probable
only
i
must
not
forget
she
said
rising
that
the
ground
for
my
doing
so
is
that
she
be
not
left
i
am
glad
to
know
said
rowland
that
i
shall
probably
often
hear
about
you
i
assure
you
i
shall
often
think
about
you
these
words
were
half
impulsive
half
deliberate
they
were
the
simple
truth
and
he
had
asked
himself
why
he
should
not
tell
her
the
truth
and
yet
they
were
not
all
of
it
her
hearing
the
rest
would
depend
upon
the
way
she
received
this
she
received
it
not
only
as
rowland
foresaw
without
a
shadow
of
coquetry
of
any
apparent
thought
of
listening
to
it
gracefully
but
with
a
slight
movement
of
nervous
deprecation
which
seemed
to
betray
itself
in
the
quickening
of
her
step
evidently
if
rowland
was
to
take
pleasure
in
hearing
about
her
it
would
have
to
be
a
highly
disinterested
pleasure
she
answered
nothing
and
rowland
too
as
he
walked
beside
her
was
silent
but
as
he
looked
along
the
what
he
was
really
facing
was
a
level
three
years
of
disinterestedness
he
ushered
them
in
by
talking
composed
civility
until
he
had
brought
miss
garland
back
to
her
companions
he
saw
her
but
once
again
he
was
obliged
to
be
in
new
york
a
couple
of
days
before
sailing
and
it
was
arranged
that
roderick
should
overtake
him
at
the
last
moment
the
evening
before
he
left
northampton
he
went
to
say
farewell
to
hudson
the
ceremony
was
brief
rowland
soon
perceived
that
the
poor
little
lady
was
in
the
melting
mood
and
as
he
dreaded
her
tears
he
compressed
a
multitude
of
solemn
promises
into
a
silent
and
took
his
leave
miss
garland
she
had
told
him
was
in
the
with
roderick
he
might
go
out
to
them
he
did
so
and
as
he
drew
near
he
heard
roderick
s
voice
ringing
behind
the
shrubbery
in
a
moment
emerging
he
found
miss
garland
leaning
against
a
tree
with
her
cousin
before
her
talking
with
great
emphasis
he
asked
pardon
for
interrupting
them
and
said
he
wished
only
to
bid
her
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
made
her
his
bow
in
silence
don
t
forget
he
said
to
roderick
as
he
turned
away
and
don
t
in
this
company
repent
of
your
i
shall
not
let
him
said
miss
garland
with
something
very
like
gayety
i
shall
see
that
he
is
punctual
he
must
go
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
having
doubted
that
he
ought
and
in
spite
of
the
dusk
rowland
could
see
that
she
had
an
even
finer
smile
than
he
had
supposed
roderick
was
punctual
eagerly
punctual
and
they
went
rowland
for
several
days
was
occupied
with
material
cares
and
lost
sight
of
his
sentimental
perplexities
but
they
only
slumbered
and
they
were
sharply
awakened
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
two
young
men
always
sat
together
upon
deck
late
into
the
evening
one
night
toward
the
last
they
were
at
the
stern
of
the
great
ship
watching
her
grind
the
solid
blackness
of
the
ocean
into
phosphorescent
foam
they
talked
on
these
occasions
of
everything
conceivable
and
had
the
air
of
having
no
secrets
from
each
other
but
it
was
on
roderick
s
conscience
that
this
air
belied
him
and
he
was
too
frank
by
nature
moreover
for
permanent
reticence
on
any
point
i
must
tell
you
something
he
said
at
last
i
should
like
you
to
know
it
and
you
will
be
so
glad
to
know
it
besides
it
s
only
a
question
of
time
three
months
hence
probably
you
would
have
guessed
it
i
am
engaged
to
mary
rowland
sat
staring
though
the
sea
was
calm
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
ship
gave
a
great
dizzying
lurch
but
in
a
moment
he
contrived
to
answer
coherently
engaged
to
miss
garland
i
never
supposed
i
never
imagined
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
roderick
interrupted
neither
did
i
until
this
last
fortnight
but
you
came
and
put
me
into
such
ridiculous
that
i
felt
an
extraordinary
desire
to
tell
some
woman
that
i
adored
her
miss
garland
is
a
magnificent
girl
you
know
her
too
little
to
do
her
justice
i
have
been
quietly
learning
to
know
her
these
past
three
months
and
have
been
falling
in
love
with
her
without
being
conscious
of
it
it
appeared
when
i
spoke
to
her
that
she
had
a
kindness
for
me
so
the
thing
was
settled
i
must
of
course
make
some
money
before
we
can
marry
it
s
rather
droll
certainly
to
engage
one
s
self
to
a
girl
whom
one
is
going
to
leave
the
next
day
for
years
we
shall
be
condemned
for
some
time
to
come
to
do
a
terrible
deal
of
abstract
thinking
about
each
other
but
i
wanted
her
blessing
on
my
career
and
i
could
not
help
asking
for
it
unless
a
man
is
unnaturally
selfish
he
needs
to
work
for
some
one
else
than
himself
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
run
a
smoother
and
swifter
course
for
knowing
that
that
fine
creature
is
waiting
at
northampton
for
news
of
my
greatness
if
ever
i
am
a
dull
companion
and
to
moping
remember
in
justice
to
me
that
i
am
in
love
and
that
my
sweetheart
is
five
thousand
miles
rowland
listened
to
all
this
with
a
sort
of
feeling
that
fortune
had
played
him
an
trick
it
had
lured
him
out
into
and
smoothed
the
sea
and
stilled
the
winds
and
given
him
a
singularly
sympathetic
comrade
and
then
it
had
turned
and
delivered
him
a
thumping
blow
in
yes
he
said
after
an
attempt
at
the
usual
formal
congratulation
you
certainly
ought
to
do
better
with
miss
garland
waiting
for
you
at
roderick
now
that
he
had
broken
ground
was
eloquent
and
rung
a
hundred
changes
on
the
assurance
that
he
was
a
very
happy
man
then
at
last
suddenly
his
climax
was
a
yawn
and
he
declared
that
he
must
go
to
bed
rowland
let
him
go
alone
and
sat
there
late
between
sea
and
sky
chapter
iii
rome
one
warm
still
day
late
in
the
roman
autumn
our
two
young
men
were
sitting
beneath
one
of
the
pines
of
the
villa
ludovisi
they
had
been
spending
an
hour
in
the
mouldy
little
where
the
colossal
mask
of
the
famous
juno
looks
out
with
blank
eyes
from
that
dusky
corner
which
must
seem
to
her
the
last
possible
stage
of
a
lapse
from
olympus
then
they
had
wandered
out
into
the
gardens
and
were
lounging
away
the
morning
under
the
spell
of
their
magical
picturesqueness
roderick
declared
that
he
would
go
nowhere
else
that
after
the
juno
it
was
a
profanation
to
look
at
anything
but
sky
and
trees
there
was
a
fresco
of
guercino
to
which
rowland
though
he
had
seen
it
on
his
former
visit
to
rome
went
dutifully
to
pay
his
respects
but
roderick
though
he
had
never
seen
it
declared
that
it
could
n
t
be
worth
a
fig
and
that
he
did
n
t
care
to
look
at
ugly
things
he
remained
stretched
on
his
overcoat
which
he
had
spread
on
the
grass
while
rowland
went
off
envying
the
intellectual
comfort
of
genius
which
can
arrive
at
serene
conclusions
without
disagreeable
processes
when
the
latter
came
back
his
friend
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
rowland
in
the
geniality
of
a
mood
attuned
to
the
mellow
charm
of
a
roman
villa
found
a
good
word
to
say
for
the
guercino
but
he
chiefly
talked
of
the
view
from
the
little
belvedere
on
the
roof
of
the
casino
and
how
it
looked
like
the
prospect
from
a
castle
turret
in
a
fairy
tale
very
likely
said
roderick
throwing
himself
back
with
a
yawn
but
i
must
let
it
pass
i
have
seen
enough
for
the
present
i
have
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
i
have
an
indigestion
of
impressions
i
must
work
them
off
before
i
go
in
for
any
more
i
don
t
want
to
look
at
any
more
of
other
people
s
works
for
a
month
not
even
at
nature
s
own
i
want
to
look
at
roderick
hudson
s
the
result
of
it
all
is
that
i
m
not
afraid
i
can
but
try
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
the
fellow
who
did
that
gazing
goddess
yonder
only
made
an
experiment
the
other
day
when
i
was
looking
at
michael
angelo
s
moses
i
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
defiance
a
reaction
against
all
this
mere
passive
enjoyment
of
grandeur
it
was
a
rousing
great
success
certainly
that
rose
there
before
me
but
somehow
it
was
not
an
inscrutable
mystery
and
it
seemed
to
me
not
perhaps
that
i
should
some
day
do
as
well
but
that
at
least
i
might
as
you
say
you
can
but
try
said
rowland
success
is
only
passionate
well
the
passion
is
blazing
we
have
been
piling
on
fuel
handsomely
it
came
over
me
just
now
that
it
is
exactly
three
months
to
a
day
since
i
left
northampton
i
can
t
believe
it
it
certainly
seems
it
seems
like
ten
years
what
an
exquisite
ass
i
was
do
you
feel
so
wise
now
verily
don
t
i
look
so
surely
i
have
n
t
the
same
face
have
n
t
i
a
different
eye
a
different
expression
a
different
voice
i
can
hardly
say
because
i
have
seen
the
transition
but
it
s
very
likely
you
are
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
more
civilized
i
dare
say
added
rowland
that
miss
garland
would
think
that
s
not
what
she
would
call
it
she
would
say
i
was
rowland
asked
few
questions
about
miss
garland
but
he
always
listened
narrowly
to
his
companion
s
voluntary
observations
are
you
very
sure
he
replied
why
she
s
a
stern
moralist
and
she
would
infer
from
my
appearance
that
i
had
become
a
cynical
roderick
had
in
fact
a
venetian
round
his
neck
and
a
magnificent
roman
intaglio
on
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
will
you
think
i
take
a
liberty
asked
rowland
if
i
say
you
judge
her
superficially
for
heaven
s
sake
cried
roderick
laughing
don
t
tell
me
she
s
not
a
moralist
it
was
for
that
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
with
rigid
virtue
in
her
she
is
a
moralist
but
not
as
you
imply
a
narrow
one
that
s
more
than
a
difference
in
degree
it
s
a
difference
in
kind
i
don
t
know
whether
i
ever
mentioned
it
but
i
admire
her
extremely
there
is
nothing
narrow
about
her
but
her
experience
everything
else
is
large
my
impression
of
her
is
of
a
person
of
great
capacity
as
yet
wholly
unmeasured
and
untested
some
day
or
other
i
m
sure
she
will
judge
fairly
and
wisely
of
stay
a
bit
cried
roderick
you
re
a
better
catholic
than
the
pope
i
shall
be
content
if
she
judges
fairly
of
me
of
my
merits
that
is
the
rest
she
must
not
judge
at
all
she
s
a
grimly
devoted
little
creature
may
she
always
remain
so
changed
as
i
am
i
adore
her
none
the
less
what
becomes
of
all
our
emotions
our
impressions
he
went
on
after
a
long
pause
all
the
material
of
thought
that
life
pours
into
us
at
such
a
rate
during
such
a
memorable
three
months
as
these
there
are
twenty
moments
a
week
a
day
for
that
matter
some
days
that
seem
supreme
twenty
impressions
that
seem
ultimate
that
appear
to
form
an
intellectual
era
but
others
come
treading
on
their
heels
and
sweeping
them
along
and
they
all
melt
like
water
into
water
and
settle
the
question
of
precedence
among
themselves
the
curious
thing
is
that
the
more
the
mind
takes
in
the
more
it
has
space
for
and
that
all
one
s
ideas
are
like
the
irish
people
at
home
who
live
in
the
different
corners
of
a
room
and
take
i
fancy
it
is
our
peculiar
good
luck
that
we
don
t
see
the
limits
of
our
minds
said
rowland
we
are
young
compared
with
what
we
may
one
day
be
that
belongs
to
youth
it
is
perhaps
the
best
part
of
it
they
say
that
old
people
do
find
themselves
at
last
face
to
face
with
a
solid
blank
wall
and
stand
thumping
against
it
in
vain
it
resounds
it
seems
to
have
something
beyond
it
but
it
won
t
move
that
s
only
a
reason
for
living
with
open
doors
as
long
as
we
can
open
doors
murmured
roderick
yes
let
us
close
no
doors
that
open
upon
rome
for
this
for
the
mind
is
eternal
summer
but
though
my
doors
may
stand
open
he
presently
added
i
shall
see
no
visitors
i
want
to
pause
and
breathe
i
want
to
dream
of
a
statue
i
have
been
working
hard
for
three
months
i
have
earned
a
right
to
a
rowland
on
his
side
was
not
without
provision
for
reflection
and
they
lingered
on
in
broken
desultory
talk
rowland
felt
the
need
for
intellectual
rest
for
a
truce
to
present
care
for
churches
statues
and
pictures
on
even
better
grounds
than
his
companion
inasmuch
as
he
had
really
been
living
roderick
s
intellectual
life
the
past
three
months
as
well
as
his
own
as
he
looked
back
on
these
weeks
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
almost
of
relief
roderick
thus
far
had
justified
his
confidence
and
flattered
his
perspicacity
he
was
rapidly
unfolding
into
an
ideal
brilliancy
he
was
changed
even
more
than
he
himself
suspected
he
had
stepped
without
faltering
into
his
birthright
and
was
spending
money
intellectually
as
lavishly
as
a
young
heir
who
has
just
won
an
obstructive
lawsuit
roderick
s
glance
and
voice
were
the
same
doubtless
as
when
they
enlivened
the
summer
dusk
on
cecilia
s
veranda
but
in
his
person
generally
there
was
an
indefinable
expression
of
experience
rapidly
and
easily
assimilated
rowland
had
been
struck
at
the
outset
with
the
instinctive
quickness
of
his
observation
and
his
free
appropriation
of
whatever
might
serve
his
purpose
he
had
not
been
for
instance
half
an
hour
on
english
soil
before
he
perceived
that
he
was
dressed
like
a
rustic
and
he
had
immediately
reformed
his
toilet
with
the
most
unerring
tact
his
appetite
for
novelty
was
insatiable
and
for
everything
characteristically
foreign
as
it
presented
itself
he
had
an
extravagant
greeting
but
in
half
an
hour
the
novelty
had
faded
he
had
guessed
the
secret
he
had
plucked
out
the
heart
of
the
mystery
and
was
clamoring
for
a
keener
sensation
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
presented
mentally
a
puzzling
spectacle
to
his
companion
he
had
caught
instinctively
the
of
the
old
world
he
observed
and
enjoyed
he
criticised
and
rhapsodized
but
though
all
things
interested
him
and
many
delighted
him
none
surprised
him
he
had
divined
their
logic
and
measured
their
proportions
and
referred
them
infallibly
to
their
categories
witnessing
the
rate
at
which
he
did
intellectual
execution
on
the
general
spectacle
of
european
life
rowland
at
moments
felt
vaguely
uneasy
for
the
future
the
boy
was
living
too
fast
he
would
have
said
and
giving
alarming
pledges
to
ennui
in
his
later
years
but
we
must
live
as
our
pulses
are
timed
and
roderick
s
struck
the
hour
very
often
he
was
by
imagination
though
he
never
became
in
manner
a
natural
man
of
the
world
he
had
intuitively
as
an
artist
what
one
may
call
the
historic
consciousness
he
had
a
relish
for
social
subtleties
and
mysteries
and
in
perception
when
occasion
offered
him
an
inch
he
never
failed
to
take
an
ell
a
single
glimpse
of
a
social
situation
of
the
elder
type
enabled
him
to
construct
the
whole
with
all
its
complex
chiaroscuro
and
rowland
more
than
once
assured
him
that
he
made
him
believe
in
the
metempsychosis
and
that
he
must
have
lived
in
european
society
in
the
last
century
as
a
gentleman
in
a
cocked
hat
and
brocaded
waistcoat
hudson
asked
rowland
questions
which
poor
rowland
was
quite
unable
to
answer
and
of
which
he
was
equally
unable
to
conceive
where
he
had
picked
up
the
data
roderick
ended
by
answering
them
himself
tolerably
to
his
satisfaction
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
almost
turned
the
tables
and
become
in
their
walks
and
talks
the
accredited
source
of
information
rowland
told
him
that
when
he
turned
sculptor
a
capital
novelist
was
spoiled
and
that
to
match
his
eye
for
social
detail
one
would
have
to
go
to
honore
de
balzac
in
all
this
rowland
took
a
generous
pleasure
he
felt
an
especial
kindness
for
his
comrade
s
radiant
youthfulness
of
temperament
he
was
so
much
younger
than
he
himself
had
ever
been
and
surely
youth
and
genius
hand
in
hand
were
the
most
beautiful
sight
in
the
world
roderick
added
to
this
the
charm
of
his
more
immediately
personal
qualities
the
vivacity
of
his
perceptions
the
audacity
of
his
imagination
the
picturesqueness
of
his
phrase
when
he
was
pleased
and
even
more
when
he
was
displeased
his
abounding
his
candor
his
unclouded
frankness
his
unfailing
impulse
to
share
every
emotion
and
impression
with
his
friend
all
this
made
comradeship
a
pure
felicity
and
interfused
with
a
deeper
amenity
their
long
evening
talks
at
cafe
doors
in
italian
towns
they
had
gone
almost
immediately
to
paris
and
had
spent
their
days
at
the
louvre
and
their
evenings
at
the
theatre
roderick
was
divided
in
mind
as
to
whether
titian
or
mademoiselle
delaporte
was
the
greater
artist
they
had
come
down
through
france
to
genoa
and
milan
had
spent
a
fortnight
in
venice
and
another
in
florence
and
had
now
been
a
month
in
rome
roderick
had
said
that
he
meant
to
spend
three
months
in
simply
looking
absorbing
and
reflecting
without
putting
pencil
to
paper
he
looked
indefatigably
and
certainly
saw
great
things
things
greater
doubtless
at
times
than
the
intentions
of
the
artist
and
yet
he
made
few
false
steps
and
wasted
little
time
in
theories
of
what
he
ought
to
like
and
to
dislike
he
judged
instinctively
and
passionately
but
never
vulgarly
at
venice
for
a
couple
of
days
he
had
half
a
fit
of
melancholy
over
the
pretended
discovery
that
he
had
missed
his
way
and
that
the
only
proper
vestment
of
plastic
conceptions
was
the
coloring
of
titian
and
paul
veronese
then
one
morning
the
two
young
men
had
themselves
rowed
out
to
torcello
and
roderick
lay
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
watching
a
gondolier
making
superb
muscular
movements
in
high
relief
against
the
sky
of
the
adriatic
and
at
the
end
jerked
himself
up
with
a
violence
that
nearly
swamped
the
gondola
and
declared
that
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
was
to
make
a
colossal
bronze
and
set
it
aloft
in
the
light
of
a
public
square
in
rome
his
first
care
was
for
the
vatican
he
went
there
again
and
again
but
the
old
imperial
and
papal
city
altogether
delighted
him
only
there
he
really
found
what
he
had
been
looking
for
from
the
first
the
complete
antipodes
of
northampton
and
indeed
rome
is
the
natural
home
of
those
spirits
with
which
we
just
now
claimed
fellowship
for
roderick
the
spirits
with
a
deep
relish
for
the
artificial
element
in
life
and
the
infinite
superpositions
of
history
it
is
the
immemorial
city
of
convention
the
stagnant
roman
air
is
charged
with
convention
it
colors
the
yellow
light
and
deepens
the
chilly
shadows
and
in
that
still
recent
day
the
most
impressive
convention
in
all
history
was
visible
to
men
s
eyes
in
the
roman
streets
erect
in
a
gilded
coach
drawn
by
four
black
horses
roderick
s
first
fortnight
was
a
high
aesthetic
revel
he
declared
that
rome
made
him
feel
and
understand
more
things
than
he
could
express
he
was
sure
that
life
must
have
there
for
all
one
s
senses
an
incomparable
fineness
that
more
interesting
things
must
happen
to
one
than
anywhere
else
and
he
gave
rowland
to
understand
that
he
meant
to
live
freely
and
largely
and
be
as
interested
as
occasion
demanded
rowland
saw
no
reason
to
regard
this
as
a
menace
of
dissipation
because
in
the
first
place
there
was
in
all
dissipation
refine
it
as
one
might
a
grossness
which
would
disqualify
it
for
roderick
s
favor
and
because
in
the
second
the
young
sculptor
was
a
man
to
regard
all
things
in
the
light
of
his
art
to
hand
over
his
passions
to
his
genius
to
be
dealt
with
and
to
find
that
he
could
live
largely
enough
without
exceeding
the
circle
of
wholesome
curiosity
rowland
took
immense
satisfaction
in
his
companion
s
deep
impatience
to
make
something
of
all
his
impressions
some
of
these
indeed
found
their
way
into
a
channel
which
did
not
lead
to
statues
but
it
was
none
the
less
a
safe
one
he
wrote
frequent
long
letters
to
miss
garland
when
rowland
went
with
him
to
post
them
he
thought
wistfully
of
the
fortune
of
the
great
missives
which
cost
roderick
unconscionable
sums
in
postage
he
received
punctual
answers
of
a
more
frugal
form
written
in
a
clear
minute
hand
on
paper
vexatiously
thin
if
rowland
was
present
when
they
came
he
turned
away
and
thought
of
other
things
or
tried
to
these
were
the
only
moments
when
his
sympathy
halted
and
they
were
brief
for
the
rest
he
let
the
days
go
by
unprotestingly
and
enjoyed
roderick
s
serene
efflorescence
as
he
would
have
done
a
beautiful
summer
sunrise
rome
for
the
past
month
had
been
delicious
the
annual
descent
of
the
goths
had
not
yet
begun
and
sunny
leisure
seemed
to
brood
over
the
city
roderick
had
taken
out
a
and
was
roughly
sketching
a
memento
of
the
great
juno
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
on
the
gravel
and
the
young
men
looking
up
saw
three
persons
advancing
one
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
with
a
rather
grand
air
and
a
great
many
furbelows
she
looked
very
hard
at
our
friends
as
she
passed
and
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
as
if
to
hasten
the
step
of
a
young
girl
who
slowly
followed
her
she
had
such
an
expansive
majesty
of
mien
that
rowland
supposed
she
must
have
some
proprietary
right
in
the
villa
and
was
not
just
then
in
a
hospitable
mood
beside
her
walked
a
little
elderly
man
tightly
buttoned
in
a
shabby
black
coat
but
with
a
flower
in
his
lappet
and
a
pair
of
soiled
light
gloves
he
was
a
personage
and
might
have
passed
for
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
reduced
by
adversity
to
playing
cicerone
to
foreigners
of
distinction
he
had
a
little
black
eye
which
glittered
like
a
diamond
and
rolled
about
like
a
ball
of
quicksilver
and
a
white
moustache
cut
short
and
stiff
like
a
brush
he
was
smiling
with
extreme
urbanity
and
talking
in
a
low
mellifluous
voice
to
the
lady
who
evidently
was
not
listening
to
him
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
this
couple
strolled
a
young
girl
apparently
of
about
twenty
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
dressed
with
extreme
elegance
she
led
by
a
cord
a
large
poodle
of
the
most
fantastic
aspect
he
was
combed
and
decked
like
a
ram
for
sacrifice
his
trunk
and
haunches
were
of
the
most
transparent
pink
his
fleecy
head
and
shoulders
as
white
as
jeweler
s
cotton
and
his
tail
and
ears
ornamented
with
long
blue
ribbons
he
stepped
along
stiffly
and
solemnly
beside
his
mistress
with
an
air
of
conscious
elegance
there
was
something
at
first
slightly
ridiculous
in
the
sight
of
a
young
lady
gravely
appended
to
an
animal
of
these
incongruous
attributes
and
roderick
with
his
customary
frankness
greeted
the
spectacle
with
a
confident
smile
the
young
girl
perceived
it
and
turned
her
face
full
upon
him
with
a
gaze
intended
apparently
to
enforce
greater
deference
it
was
not
deference
however
her
face
provoked
but
startled
submissive
admiration
roderick
s
smile
fell
dead
and
he
sat
eagerly
staring
a
pair
of
extraordinary
dark
blue
eyes
a
mass
of
dusky
hair
over
a
low
forehead
a
blooming
oval
of
perfect
purity
a
flexible
lip
just
touched
with
disdain
the
step
and
carriage
of
a
tired
princess
these
were
the
general
features
of
his
vision
the
young
lady
was
walking
slowly
and
letting
her
long
dress
rustle
over
the
gravel
the
young
men
had
time
to
see
her
distinctly
before
she
averted
her
face
and
went
her
way
she
left
a
vague
sweet
perfume
behind
her
as
she
passed
immortal
powers
cried
roderick
what
a
vision
in
the
name
of
transcendent
perfection
who
is
she
he
sprang
up
and
stood
looking
after
her
until
she
rounded
a
turn
in
the
avenue
what
a
movement
what
a
manner
what
a
poise
of
the
head
i
wonder
if
she
would
sit
to
you
had
better
go
and
ask
her
said
rowland
laughing
she
is
certainly
most
beautiful
she
s
beauty
itself
she
s
a
revelation
i
don
t
believe
she
is
living
she
s
a
phantasm
a
vapor
an
illusion
the
poodle
said
rowland
is
certainly
nay
he
too
may
be
a
grotesque
phantom
like
the
black
dog
in
i
hope
at
least
that
the
young
lady
has
nothing
in
common
with
mephistopheles
she
looked
if
beauty
is

roderick
besides
the

wondering
how
he
had
ascertained
these
facts

the
young
sculptor

he
sat
down
again
and
went
on
with
his
sketch
of
the
juno
scrawled
away
for
ten
minutes
and
then
handed
the
result
in
silence
to
rowland
rowland
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
applause
the
drawing
represented
the
juno
as
to
the
position
of
the
head
the
brow
and
the
broad
fillet
across
the
hair
but
the
eyes
the
mouth
the
physiognomy
were
a
vivid
portrait
of
the
young
girl
with
the
poodle
i
have
been
wanting
a
subject
said
roderick
there
s
one
made
to
my
hand
and
now
for
work
they
saw
no
more
of
the
young
girl
though
roderick
looked
hopefully
for
some
days
into
the
carriages
on
the
pincian
she
had
evidently
been
but
passing
through
rome
naples
or
florence
now
happily
possessed
her
and
she
was
guiding
her
fleecy
companion
through
the
villa
reale
or
the
boboli
gardens
with
the
same
superb
defiance
of
irony
roderick
went
to
work
and
spent
a
month
shut
up
in
his
studio
he
had
an
idea
and
he
was
not
to
rest
till
he
had
embodied
it
he
had
established
himself
in
the
basement
of
a
huge
dusky
dilapidated
old
house
in
that
long
tortuous
and
preeminently
roman
street
which
leads
from
the
corso
to
the
bridge
of
angelo
the
black
archway
which
admitted
you
might
have
served
as
the
portal
of
the
augean
stables
but
you
emerged
presently
upon
a
mouldy
little
court
of
which
the
fourth
side
was
formed
by
a
narrow
terrace
overhanging
the
tiber
here
along
the
parapet
were
stationed
half
a
dozen
shapeless
fragments
of
sculpture
with
a
couple
of
meagre
in
tubs
and
an
oleander
that
never
flowered
the
unclean
historic
river
swept
beneath
behind
were
dusky
reeking
walls
spotted
here
and
there
with
hanging
rags
and
in
windows
opposite
at
a
distance
were
the
bare
brown
banks
of
the
stream
the
huge
rotunda
of
angelo
tipped
with
its
seraphic
statue
the
dome
of
peter
s
and
the
pines
of
the
villa
doria
the
place
was
crumbling
and
shabby
and
melancholy
but
the
river
was
delightful
the
rent
was
a
trifle
and
everything
was
picturesque
roderick
was
in
the
best
humor
with
his
quarters
from
the
first
and
was
certain
that
the
working
mood
there
would
be
intenser
in
an
hour
than
in
twenty
years
of
northampton
his
studio
was
a
huge
empty
room
with
a
vaulted
ceiling
covered
with
vague
dark
traces
of
an
old
fresco
which
rowland
when
he
spent
an
hour
with
his
friend
used
to
stare
at
vainly
for
some
surviving
coherence
of
floating
draperies
and
clasping
arms
roderick
had
lodged
himself
economically
in
the
same
quarter
he
occupied
a
fifth
floor
on
the
ripetta
but
he
was
only
at
home
to
sleep
for
when
he
was
not
at
work
he
was
either
lounging
in
rowland
s
more
luxurious
rooms
or
strolling
through
streets
and
churches
and
gardens
rowland
had
found
a
convenient
corner
in
a
stately
old
palace
not
far
from
the
fountain
of
trevi
and
made
himself
a
home
to
which
books
and
pictures
and
prints
and
odds
and
ends
of
curious
furniture
gave
an
air
of
leisurely
permanence
he
had
the
tastes
of
a
collector
he
spent
half
his
afternoons
ransacking
the
dusty
magazines
of
the
and
often
made
his
way
in
quest
of
a
prize
into
the
heart
of
impecunious
roman
households
which
had
been
prevailed
upon
to
listen
with
closed
doors
and
an
impenetrably
wary
smile
to
proposals
for
an
hereditary
in
the
evening
often
under
the
lamp
amid
dropped
curtains
and
the
scattered
gleam
of
firelight
upon
polished
carvings
and
mellow
paintings
the
two
friends
sat
with
their
heads
together
criticising
intaglios
and
etchings
drawings
and
illuminated
missals
roderick
s
quick
appreciation
of
every
form
of
artistic
beauty
reminded
his
companion
of
the
flexible
temperament
of
those
italian
artists
of
the
sixteenth
century
who
were
indifferently
painters
and
sculptors
sonneteers
and
engravers
at
times
when
he
saw
how
the
young
sculptor
s
day
passed
in
a
single
sustained
pulsation
while
his
own
was
broken
into
a
dozen
conscious
devices
for
disposing
of
the
hours
and
intermingled
with
sighs
half
suppressed
some
of
them
for
conscience
sake
over
what
he
failed
of
in
action
and
missed
in
possession
he
felt
a
pang
of
something
akin
to
envy
but
rowland
had
two
substantial
aids
for
giving
patience
the
air
of
contentment
he
was
an
inquisitive
reader
and
a
passionate
rider
he
plunged
into
bulky
german
octavos
on
italian
history
and
he
spent
long
afternoons
in
the
saddle
ranging
over
the
grassy
desolation
of
the
campagna
as
the
season
went
on
and
the
social
groups
began
to
constitute
themselves
he
found
that
he
knew
a
great
many
people
and
that
he
had
easy
opportunity
for
knowing
others
he
enjoyed
a
quiet
corner
of
a
beside
an
agreeable
woman
and
although
the
machinery
of
what
calls
itself
society
seemed
to
him
to
have
many
superfluous
wheels
he
accepted
invitations
and
made
visits
punctiliously
from
the
conviction
that
the
only
way
not
to
be
overcome
by
the
ridiculous
side
of
most
of
such
observances
is
to
take
them
with
exaggerated
gravity
he
introduced
roderick
right
and
left
and
suffered
him
to
make
his
way
himself
an
enterprise
for
which
roderick
very
soon
displayed
an
capacity
wherever
he
went
he
made
not
exactly
what
is
called
a
favorable
impression
but
what
from
a
practical
point
of
view
is
better
a
puzzling
one
he
took
to
evening
parties
as
a
duck
to
water
and
before
the
winter
was
half
over
was
the
most
freely
and
frequently
discussed
young
man
in
the
heterogeneous
foreign
colony
rowland
s
theory
of
his
own
duty
was
to
let
him
run
his
course
and
play
his
cards
only
holding
himself
ready
to
point
out
shoals
and
pitfalls
and
administer
a
friendly
propulsion
through
tight
places
roderick
s
manners
on
the
precincts
of
the
pincian
were
quite
the
same
as
his
manners
on
cecilia
s
veranda
that
is
they
were
no
manners
at
all
but
it
remained
as
true
as
before
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
on
the
whole
to
violate
ceremony
with
less
of
lasting
offense
he
interrupted
he
contradicted
he
spoke
to
people
he
had
never
seen
and
left
his
social
creditors
without
the
smallest
conversational
interest
on
their
loans
he
lounged
and
yawned
he
talked
loud
when
he
should
have
talked
low
and
low
when
he
should
have
talked
loud
many
people
in
consequence
thought
him
insufferably
conceited
and
declared
that
he
ought
to
wait
till
he
had
something
to
show
for
his
powers
before
he
assumed
the
airs
of
a
spoiled
celebrity
but
to
rowland
and
to
most
friendly
observers
this
judgment
was
quite
beside
the
mark
and
the
young
man
s
undiluted
naturalness
was
its
own
justification
he
was
impulsive
spontaneous
sincere
there
were
so
many
people
at
and
in
studios
who
were
not
that
it
seemed
worth
while
to
allow
this
rare
specimen
all
possible
freedom
of
action
if
roderick
took
the
words
out
of
your
mouth
when
you
were
just
prepared
to
deliver
them
with
the
most
effective
accent
he
did
it
with
a
perfect
good
conscience
and
with
no
pretension
of
a
better
right
to
being
heard
but
simply
because
he
was
full
to
overflowing
of
his
own
momentary
thought
and
it
sprang
from
his
lips
without
asking
leave
there
were
persons
who
waited
on
your
periods
much
more
deferentially
who
were
a
hundred
times
more
capable
than
roderick
of
a
reflective
impertinence
roderick
received
from
various
sources
chiefly
feminine
enough
advice
to
have
established
him
in
life
as
an
embodiment
of
the
proprieties
and
he
received
it
as
he
afterwards
listened
to
criticisms
on
his
statues
with
unfaltering
candor
and
here
and
there
doubtless
as
he
went
he
took
in
a
reef
in
his
sail
but
he
was
too
adventurous
a
spirit
to
be
successfully
tamed
and
he
remained
at
most
points
the
florid
rather
strident
young
virginian
whose
serene
inflexibility
had
been
the
despair
of
striker
all
this
was
what
friendly
commentators
still
chiefly
feminine
alluded
to
when
they
spoke
of
his
delightful
freshness
and
critics
of
harsher
sensibilities
of
the
other
sex
when
they
denounced
his
damned
impertinence
his
appearance
enforced
these
impressions
his
handsome
face
his
radiant
unaverted
eyes
his
childish
unmodulated
voice
afterwards
when
those
who
loved
him
were
in
tears
there
was
something
in
all
this
unspotted
comeliness
that
seemed
to
lend
a
mockery
to
the
causes
of
their
sorrow
certainly
among
the
young
men
of
genius
who
for
so
many
ages
have
gone
up
to
rome
to
test
their
powers
none
ever
made
a
fairer
beginning
than
roderick
he
rode
his
two
horses
at
once
with
extraordinary
good
fortune
he
established
the
happiest
modus
vivendi
betwixt
work
and
play
he
wrestled
all
day
with
a
mountain
of
clay
in
his
studio
and
chattered
half
the
night
away
in
roman
it
all
seemed
part
of
a
kind
of
divine
facility
he
was
passionately
interested
he
was
feeling
his
powers
now
that
they
had
thoroughly
kindled
in
the
glowing
aesthetic
atmosphere
of
rome
the
ardent
young
fellow
should
be
pardoned
for
believing
that
he
never
was
to
see
the
end
of
them
he
enjoyed
immeasurably
after
the
chronic
obstruction
of
home
the
downright
act
of
production
he
kept
models
in
his
studio
till
they
dropped
with
fatigue
he
drew
on
other
days
at
the
capitol
and
the
vatican
till
his
own
head
swam
with
his
eagerness
and
his
limbs
stiffened
with
the
cold
he
had
promptly
set
up
a
figure
which
he
called
an
adam
and
was
pushing
it
rapidly
toward
completion
there
were
naturally
a
great
many
wiseheads
who
smiled
at
his
precipitancy
and
cited
him
as
one
more
example
of
yankee
crudity
a
capital
recruit
to
the
great
army
of
those
who
wish
to
dance
before
they
can
walk
they
were
right
but
roderick
was
right
too
for
the
success
of
his
statue
was
not
to
have
been
foreseen
it
partook
really
of
the
miraculous
he
never
surpassed
it
afterwards
and
a
good
judge
here
and
there
has
been
known
to
pronounce
it
the
finest
piece
of
sculpture
of
our
modern
era
to
rowland
it
seemed
to
justify
superbly
his
highest
hopes
of
his
friend
and
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
had
invested
his
happiness
in
fostering
a
genius
he
ought
now
to
be
in
possession
of
a
boundless
complacency
there
was
something
especially
confident
and
masterly
in
the
artist
s
negligence
of
all
such
small
picturesque
accessories
as
might
serve
to
label
his
figure
to
a
vulgar
apprehension
if
it
represented
the
father
of
the
human
race
and
the
primal
embodiment
of
human
sensation
it
did
so
in
virtue
of
its
look
of
balanced
physical
perfection
and
deeply
eagerly
sentient
vitality
rowland
in
fraternal
zeal
traveled
up
to
carrara
and
selected
at
the
quarries
the
most
magnificent
block
of
marble
he
could
find
and
when
it
came
down
to
rome
the
two
young
men
had
a
they
drove
out
to
albano
breakfasted
boisterously
in
their
respective
measure
at
the
inn
and
lounged
away
the
day
in
the
sun
on
the
top
of
monte
cavo
roderick
s
head
was
full
of
ideas
for
other
works
which
he
described
with
infinite
spirit
and
eloquence
as
vividly
as
if
they
were
ranged
on
their
pedestals
before
him
he
had
an
indefatigable
fancy
things
he
saw
in
the
streets
in
the
country
things
he
heard
and
read
effects
he
saw
just
missed
or
in
the
works
of
others
acted
upon
his
mind
as
a
kind
of
challenge
and
he
was
terribly
restless
until
in
some
form
or
other
he
had
taken
up
the
glove
and
set
his
lance
in
rest
the
adam
was
put
into
marble
and
all
the
world
came
to
see
it
of
the
criticisms
passed
upon
it
this
history
undertakes
to
offer
no
record
over
many
of
them
the
two
young
men
had
a
daily
laugh
for
a
month
and
certain
of
the
formulas
of
the
connoisseurs
restrictive
or
indulgent
furnished
roderick
with
a
permanent
supply
of
humorous
but
people
enough
spoke
flattering
to
make
roderick
feel
as
if
he
were
already
half
famous
the
statue
passed
formally
into
rowland
s
possession
and
was
paid
for
as
if
an
illustrious
name
had
been
chiseled
on
the
pedestal
poor
roderick
owed
every
franc
of
the
money
it
was
not
for
this
however
but
because
he
was
so
gloriously
in
the
mood
that
denying
himself
all
on
the
same
day
he
had
given
the
last
touch
to
the
adam
he
began
to
shape
the
rough
contour
of
an
eve
this
went
forward
with
equal
rapidity
and
success
roderick
lost
his
temper
time
and
again
with
his
models
who
offered
but
a
gross
degenerate
image
of
his
splendid
ideal
but
his
ideal
as
he
assured
rowland
became
gradually
such
a
fixed
vivid
presence
that
he
had
only
to
shut
his
eyes
to
behold
a
creature
far
more
to
his
purpose
than
the
poor
girl
who
stood
posturing
at
forty
sous
an
hour
the
eve
was
finished
in
a
month
and
the
feat
was
extraordinary
as
well
as
the
statue
which
represented
an
admirably
beautiful
woman
when
the
spring
began
to
muffle
the
rugged
old
city
with
its
clambering
festoons
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
done
a
handsome
winter
s
work
and
had
fairly
earned
a
holiday
he
took
a
liberal
one
and
lounged
away
the
lovely
roman
may
doing
nothing
he
looked
very
contented
with
himself
perhaps
at
times
a
trifle
too
obviously
but
who
could
have
said
without
good
reason
he
was
flushed
with
triumph
this
classic
phrase
portrayed
him
to
rowland
s
sense
he
would
lose
himself
in
long
reveries
and
emerge
from
them
with
a
quickened
smile
and
a
heightened
color
rowland
grudged
him
none
of
his
smiles
and
took
an
extreme
satisfaction
in
his
two
statues
he
had
the
adam
and
the
eve
transported
to
his
own
apartment
and
one
warm
evening
in
may
he
gave
a
little
dinner
in
honor
of
the
artist
it
was
small
but
rowland
had
meant
it
should
be
very
agreeably
composed
he
thought
over
his
friends
and
chose
four
they
were
all
persons
with
whom
he
lived
in
a
certain
intimacy
one
of
them
was
an
american
sculptor
of
french
extraction
or
remotely
perhaps
of
italian
for
he
rejoiced
in
the
somewhat
fervid
name
of
gloriani
he
was
a
man
of
forty
he
had
been
living
for
years
in
paris
and
in
rome
and
he
now
drove
a
very
pretty
trade
in
sculpture
of
the
ornamental
and
fantastic
sort
in
his
youth
he
had
had
money
but
he
had
spent
it
recklessly
much
of
it
scandalously
and
at
had
found
himself
obliged
to
make
capital
of
his
talent
this
was
quite
inimitable
and
fifteen
years
of
indefatigable
exercise
had
brought
it
to
perfection
rowland
admitted
its
power
though
it
gave
him
very
little
pleasure
what
he
relished
in
the
man
was
the
extraordinary
vivacity
and
frankness
not
to
call
it
the
impudence
of
his
ideas
he
had
a
definite
practical
scheme
of
art
and
he
knew
at
least
what
he
meant
in
this
sense
he
was
solid
and
complete
there
were
so
many
of
the
aesthetic
fraternity
who
were
floundering
in
unknown
seas
without
a
notion
of
which
way
their
noses
were
turned
that
gloriani
conscious
and
compact
unlimitedly
intelligent
and
consummately
clever
dogmatic
only
as
to
his
own
duties
and
at
once
gracefully
deferential
and
profoundly
indifferent
to
those
of
others
had
for
rowland
a
certain
intellectual
refreshment
quite
independent
of
the
character
of
his
works
these
were
considered
by
most
people
to
belong
to
a
very
corrupt
and
by
many
to
a
positively
indecent
school
others
thought
them
tremendously
knowing
and
paid
enormous
prices
for
them
and
indeed
to
be
able
to
point
to
one
of
gloriani
s
figures
in
a
shady
corner
of
your
library
was
tolerable
proof
that
you
were
not
a
fool
corrupt
things
they
certainly
were
in
the
line
of
sculpture
they
were
quite
the
latest
fruit
of
time
it
was
the
artist
s
opinion
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
beauty
and
ugliness
that
they
overlap
and
intermingle
in
a
quite
inextricable
manner
that
there
is
no
saying
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
that
hideousness
grimaces
at
you
suddenly
from
out
of
the
very
bosom
of
loveliness
and
beauty
blooms
before
your
eyes
in
the
lap
of
vileness
that
it
is
a
waste
of
wit
to
nurse
metaphysical
distinctions
and
a
sadly
meagre
entertainment
to
caress
imaginary
lines
that
the
thing
to
aim
at
is
the
expressive
and
the
way
to
reach
it
is
by
ingenuity
that
for
this
purpose
everything
may
serve
and
that
a
consummate
work
is
a
sort
of
of
the
pure
and
the
impure
the
graceful
and
the
grotesque
its
prime
duty
is
to
amuse
to
puzzle
to
fascinate
to
savor
of
a
complex
imagination
gloriani
s
statues
were
florid
and
meretricious
they
looked
like
magnified
goldsmith
s
work
they
were
extremely
elegant
but
they
had
no
charm
for
rowland
he
never
bought
one
but
gloriani
was
such
an
honest
fellow
and
withal
was
so
deluged
with
orders
that
this
made
no
difference
in
their
friendship
the
artist
might
have
passed
for
a
frenchman
he
was
a
great
talker
and
a
very
picturesque
one
he
was
almost
bald
he
had
a
small
bright
eye
a
broken
nose
and
a
moustache
with
waxed
ends
when
sometimes
he
received
you
at
his
lodging
he
introduced
you
to
a
lady
with
a
plain
face
whom
he
called
madame
gloriani
which
she
was
not
rowland
s
second
guest
was
also
an
artist
but
of
a
very
different
type
his
friends
called
him
sam
singleton
he
was
an
american
and
he
had
been
in
rome
a
couple
of
years
he
painted
small
landscapes
chiefly
in
rowland
had
seen
one
of
them
in
a
shop
window
had
liked
it
extremely
and
ascertaining
his
address
had
gone
to
see
him
and
found
him
established
in
a
very
humble
studio
near
the
piazza
barberini
where
apparently
fame
and
fortune
had
not
yet
found
him
out
rowland
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
bought
several
of
his
pictures
singleton
made
few
speeches
but
was
grateful
rowland
heard
afterwards
that
when
he
first
came
to
rome
he
painted
worthless
daubs
and
gave
no
promise
of
talent
improvement
had
come
however
hand
in
hand
with
patient
industry
and
his
talent
though
of
a
slender
and
delicate
order
was
now
incontestable
it
was
as
yet
but
scantily
recognized
and
he
had
hard
work
to
live
rowland
hung
his
little
on
the
parlor
wall
and
found
that
as
he
lived
with
them
he
grew
very
fond
of
them
singleton
was
a
diminutive
dwarfish
personage
he
looked
like
a
precocious
child
he
had
a
high
protuberant
forehead
a
transparent
brown
eye
a
perpetual
smile
an
extraordinary
expression
of
modesty
and
patience
he
listened
much
more
willingly
than
he
talked
with
a
little
fixed
grateful
grin
he
blushed
when
he
spoke
and
always
offered
his
ideas
in
a
sidelong
fashion
as
if
the
presumption
were
against
them
his
modesty
set
them
off
and
they
were
eminently
to
the
point
he
was
so
perfect
an
example
of
the
little
noiseless
laborious
artist
whom
chance
in
the
person
of
a
moneyed
patron
has
never
taken
by
the
hand
that
rowland
would
have
liked
to
befriend
him
by
stealth
singleton
had
expressed
a
fervent
admiration
for
roderick
s
productions
but
had
not
yet
met
the
young
master
roderick
was
lounging
against
the
when
he
came
in
and
rowland
presently
introduced
him
the
little
stood
with
folded
hands
blushing
smiling
and
looking
up
at
him
as
if
roderick
were
himself
a
statue
on
a
pedestal
singleton
began
to
murmur
something
about
his
pleasure
his
admiration
the
desire
to
make
his
compliment
smoothly
gave
him
a
kind
of
grotesque
formalism
roderick
looked
down
at
him
surprised
and
suddenly
burst
into
a
laugh
singleton
paused
a
moment
and
then
with
an
intenser
smile
went
on
well
sir
your
statues
are
beautiful
all
the
same
rowland
s
two
other
guests
were
ladies
and
one
of
them
miss
blanchard
belonged
also
to
the
artistic
fraternity
she
was
an
american
she
was
young
she
was
pretty
and
she
had
made
her
way
to
rome
alone
and
unaided
she
lived
alone
or
with
no
other
duenna
than
a
old
though
indeed
she
had
a
friendly
neighbor
in
the
person
of
a
certain
madame
grandoni
who
in
various
social
emergencies
lent
her
a
protecting
wing
and
had
come
with
her
to
rowland
s
dinner
miss
blanchard
had
a
little
money
but
she
was
not
above
selling
her
pictures
these
represented
generally
a
bunch
of
roses
with
the
very
highly
finished
or
else
a
wayside
shrine
and
a
peasant
woman
with
her
back
turned
kneeling
before
it
she
did
backs
very
well
but
she
was
a
little
weak
in
faces
flowers
however
were
her
speciality
and
though
her
touch
was
a
little
and
finical
she
painted
them
with
remarkable
skill
her
pictures
were
chiefly
bought
by
the
english
rowland
had
made
her
acquaintance
early
in
the
winter
and
as
she
kept
a
saddle
horse
and
rode
a
great
deal
he
had
asked
permission
to
be
her
cavalier
in
this
way
they
had
become
almost
intimate
miss
blanchard
s
name
was
augusta
she
was
slender
pale
and
elegant
looking
she
had
a
very
pretty
head
and
brilliant
auburn
hair
which
she
braided
with
classical
simplicity
she
talked
in
a
sweet
soft
voice
used
language
at
times
a
trifle
superfine
and
made
literary
allusions
these
had
often
a
patriotic
strain
and
rowland
had
more
than
once
been
irritated
by
her
quotations
from
sigourney
in
the
of
monte
mario
and
from
willis
among
the
ruins
of
veii
rowland
was
of
a
dozen
different
minds
about
her
and
was
half
surprised
at
times
to
find
himself
treating
it
as
a
matter
of
serious
moment
whether
he
liked
her
or
not
he
admired
her
and
indeed
there
was
something
admirable
in
her
combination
of
beauty
and
talent
of
isolation
and
tranquil
he
used
sometimes
to
go
into
the
little
ordinary
room
which
served
her
as
a
studio
and
find
her
working
at
a
panel
six
inches
square
at
an
open
casement
profiled
against
the
deep
blue
roman
sky
she
received
him
with
a
dignity
that
made
her
seem
like
a
painted
saint
on
a
church
window
receiving
the
daylight
in
all
her
being
the
breath
of
reproach
passed
her
by
with
folded
wings
and
yet
rowland
wondered
why
he
did
not
like
her
better
if
he
failed
the
reason
was
not
far
to
seek
there
was
another
woman
whom
he
liked
better
an
image
in
his
heart
which
refused
to
yield
precedence
on
that
evening
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
when
rowland
was
left
alone
between
the
starlight
and
the
waves
with
the
sudden
knowledge
that
mary
garland
was
to
become
another
man
s
wife
he
had
made
after
a
while
the
simple
resolution
to
forget
her
and
every
day
since
like
a
famous
philosopher
who
wished
to
abbreviate
his
mourning
for
a
faithful
servant
he
had
said
to
himself
in
substance
remember
to
forget
mary
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
succeeding
then
suddenly
when
he
was
least
expecting
it
he
would
find
her
name
inaudibly
on
his
lips
and
seem
to
see
her
eyes
meeting
his
eyes
all
this
made
him
uncomfortable
and
seemed
to
portend
a
possible
discord
discord
was
not
to
his
taste
he
shrank
from
imperious
passions
and
the
idea
of
finding
himself
jealous
of
an
unsuspecting
friend
was
absolutely
repulsive
more
than
ever
then
the
path
of
duty
was
to
forget
mary
garland
and
he
cultivated
oblivion
as
we
may
say
in
the
person
of
miss
blanchard
her
fine
temper
he
said
to
himself
was
a
trifle
cold
and
conscious
her
purity
prudish
perhaps
her
culture
pedantic
but
since
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
hopes
of
mary
garland
providence
owed
him
a
compensation
and
he
had
fits
of
angry
sadness
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
attest
his
right
to
sentimental
satisfaction
he
would
be
capable
of
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
he
absolutely
detested
if
she
were
the
best
that
came
in
his
way
and
what
was
the
use
after
all
of
bothering
about
a
possible
which
was
only
perhaps
a
dream
even
if
mary
garland
had
been
free
what
right
had
he
to
assume
that
he
would
have
pleased
her
the
actual
was
good
enough
miss
blanchard
had
beautiful
hair
and
if
she
was
a
trifle
there
is
nothing
like
matrimony
for
curing
madame
grandoni
who
had
formed
with
the
companion
of
rowland
s
rides
an
alliance
which
might
have
been
called
defensive
on
the
part
of
the
former
and
attractive
on
that
of
miss
blanchard
was
an
excessively
ugly
old
lady
highly
esteemed
in
roman
society
for
her
homely
benevolence
and
her
shrewd
and
humorous
good
sense
she
had
been
the
widow
of
a
german
archaeologist
who
had
come
to
rome
in
the
early
ages
as
an
attache
of
the
prussian
legation
on
the
capitoline
her
good
sense
had
been
wanting
on
but
a
single
occasion
that
of
her
second
marriage
this
occasion
was
certainly
a
momentous
one
but
these
by
common
consent
are
not
test
cases
a
couple
of
years
after
her
first
husband
s
death
she
had
accepted
the
hand
and
the
name
of
a
neapolitan
ten
years
younger
than
herself
and
with
no
fortune
but
his
the
marriage
was
most
unhappy
and
the
maestro
grandoni
was
suspected
of
using
the
as
an
instrument
of
conjugal
correction
he
had
finally
run
off
with
a
prima
donna
assoluta
who
it
was
to
be
hoped
had
given
him
a
taste
of
the
quality
implied
in
her
title
he
was
believed
to
be
living
still
but
he
had
shrunk
to
a
small
black
spot
in
madame
grandoni
s
life
and
for
ten
years
she
had
not
mentioned
his
name
she
wore
a
light
flaxen
wig
which
was
never
very
artfully
adjusted
but
this
mattered
little
as
she
made
no
secret
of
it
she
used
to
say
i
was
not
always
so
ugly
as
this
as
a
young
girl
i
had
beautiful
golden
hair
very
much
the
color
of
my
she
had
worn
from
time
immemorial
an
old
blue
satin
dress
and
a
white
crape
shawl
embroidered
in
colors
her
appearance
was
ridiculous
but
she
had
an
interminable
teutonic
pedigree
and
her
manners
in
every
presence
were
easy
and
jovial
as
became
a
lady
whose
ancestor
had
been
to
frederick
barbarossa
thirty
years
observation
of
roman
society
had
sharpened
her
wits
and
given
her
an
inexhaustible
store
of
anecdotes
but
she
had
beneath
her
crumpled
bodice
a
fund
of
teutonic
sentiment
which
she
communicated
only
to
the
objects
of
her
particular
favor
rowland
had
a
great
regard
for
her
and
she
repaid
it
by
wishing
him
to
get
married
she
never
saw
him
without
whispering
to
him
that
augusta
blanchard
was
just
the
girl
it
seemed
to
rowland
a
sort
of
foreshadowing
of
matrimony
to
see
miss
blanchard
standing
gracefully
on
his
and
blooming
behind
the
central
bouquet
at
his
circular
the
dinner
was
very
prosperous
and
roderick
amply
filled
his
position
as
hero
of
the
feast
he
had
always
an
air
of
buoyant
enjoyment
in
his
work
but
on
this
occasion
he
manifested
a
good
deal
of
harmless
pleasure
in
his
glory
he
drank
freely
and
talked
bravely
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
flung
open
the
gates
of
his
eloquence
singleton
sat
gazing
and
listening
as
if
apollo
in
person
were
talking
gloriani
showed
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
an
evident
disposition
to
draw
roderick
out
rowland
was
rather
regretful
for
he
knew
that
theory
was
not
his
friend
s
strong
point
and
that
it
was
never
fair
to
take
his
measure
from
his
talk
as
you
have
begun
with
adam
and
eve
said
gloriani
i
suppose
you
are
going
straight
through
the
he
was
one
of
the
persons
who
thought
roderick
delightfully
fresh
i
may
make
a
david
said
roderick
but
i
shall
not
try
any
more
of
the
old
testament
people
i
don
t
like
the
jews
i
don
t
like
pendulous
noses
david
the
boy
david
is
rather
an
exception
you
can
think
of
him
and
treat
him
as
a
young
greek
standing
forth
there
on
the
plain
of
battle
between
the
contending
armies
rushing
forward
to
let
fly
his
stone
he
looks
like
a
beautiful
runner
at
the
olympic
games
after
that
i
shall
skip
to
the
new
testament
i
mean
to
make
a
you
ll
put
nothing
of
the
olympic
games
into
him
i
hope
said
gloriani
oh
i
shall
make
him
very
different
from
the
christ
of
tradition
more
more
and
roderick
paused
a
moment
to
think
this
was
the
first
that
rowland
had
heard
of
his
christ
more
rationalistic
i
suppose
suggested
miss
blanchard
more
idealistic
cried
roderick
the
perfection
of
form
you
know
to
symbolize
the
perfection
of
for
a
companion
piece
said
miss
blanchard
you
ought
to
make
a
never
i
mean
never
to
make
anything
ugly
the
greeks
never
made
anything
ugly
and
i
m
a
hellenist
i
m
not
a
hebraist
i
have
been
thinking
lately
of
making
a
cain
but
i
should
never
dream
of
making
him
ugly
he
should
be
a
very
handsome
fellow
and
he
should
lift
up
the
murderous
club
with
the
beautiful
movement
of
the
fighters
in
the
greek
friezes
who
are
chopping
at
their
there
s
no
use
trying
to
be
a
greek
said
gloriani
if
phidias
were
to
come
back
he
would
recommend
you
to
give
it
up
i
am
half
italian
and
half
french
and
as
a
whole
a
yankee
what
sort
of
a
greek
should
i
make
i
think
the
judas
is
a
capital
idea
for
a
statue
much
obliged
to
you
madame
for
the
suggestion
what
an
insidious
little
scoundrel
one
might
make
of
him
sitting
there
nursing
his
and
his
treachery
there
can
be
a
great
deal
of
expression
in
a
pendulous
nose
my
dear
sir
especially
when
it
is
cast
in
green
very
likely
said
roderick
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
expression
i
care
for
i
care
only
for
perfect
beauty
there
it
is
if
you
want
to
know
it
that
s
as
good
a
profession
of
faith
as
another
in
future
so
far
as
my
things
are
not
positively
beautiful
you
may
set
them
down
as
failures
for
me
it
s
either
that
or
nothing
it
s
against
the
taste
of
the
day
i
know
we
have
really
lost
the
faculty
to
understand
beauty
in
the
large
ideal
way
we
stand
like
a
race
with
shrunken
muscles
staring
helplessly
at
the
weights
our
forefathers
easily
lifted
but
i
don
t
hesitate
to
proclaim
it
i
mean
to
lift
them
again
i
mean
to
go
in
for
big
things
that
s
my
notion
of
my
art
i
mean
to
do
things
that
will
be
simple
and
vast
and
infinite
you
ll
see
if
they
won
t
be
infinite
excuse
me
if
i
brag
a
little
all
those
italian
fellows
in
the
renaissance
used
to
brag
there
was
a
sensation
once
common
i
am
sure
in
the
human
breast
a
kind
of
religious
awe
in
the
presence
of
a
marble
image
newly
created
and
expressing
the
human
type
in
superhuman
purity
when
phidias
and
praxiteles
had
their
statues
of
goddesses
unveiled
in
the
temples
of
the
aegean
don
t
you
suppose
there
was
a
passionate
beating
of
hearts
a
thrill
of
mysterious
terror
i
mean
to
bring
it
back
i
mean
to
thrill
the
world
again
i
mean
to
produce
a
juno
that
will
make
you
tremble
a
venus
that
will
make
you
swoon
so
that
when
we
come
and
see
you
said
madame
grandoni
we
must
be
sure
and
bring
our
and
pray
have
a
few
soft
sofas
conveniently
phidias
and
praxiteles
miss
blanchard
remarked
had
the
advantage
of
believing
in
their
goddesses
i
insist
on
believing
for
myself
that
the
pagan
mythology
is
not
a
fiction
and
that
venus
and
juno
and
apollo
and
mercury
used
to
come
down
in
a
cloud
into
this
very
city
of
rome
where
we
sit
talking
nineteenth
century
nineteenth
century
nonsense
my
dear
cried
madame
grandoni
mr
hudson
may
be
a
new
phidias
but
venus
and
juno
that
s
you
and
i
arrived
in
a
very
dirty
cab
and
were
cheated
by
the
driver
but
my
dear
fellow
objected
gloriani
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
make
over
in
cold
blood
those
poor
old
exploded
apollos
and
it
won
t
matter
what
you
call
them
said
roderick
they
shall
be
simply
divine
forms
they
shall
be
beauty
they
shall
be
wisdom
they
shall
be
power
they
shall
be
genius
they
shall
be
daring
that
s
all
the
greek
divinities
that
s
rather
abstract
you
know
said
miss
blanchard
my
dear
fellow
cried
gloriani
you
re
delightfully
i
hope
you
ll
not
grow
any
older
said
singleton
with
a
flush
of
sympathy
across
his
large
white
forehead
you
can
do
it
if
you
then
there
are
all
the
forces
and
mysteries
and
elements
of
nature
roderick
went
on
i
mean
to
do
the
morning
i
mean
to
do
the
night
i
mean
to
do
the
ocean
and
the
mountains
the
moon
and
the
west
wind
i
mean
to
make
a
magnificent
statue
of
america
america
the
mountains
the
moon
said
gloriani
you
ll
find
it
rather
hard
i
m
afraid
to
compress
such
subjects
into
classic
oh
there
s
a
way
cried
roderick
and
i
shall
think
it
out
my
figures
shall
make
no
contortions
but
they
shall
mean
a
tremendous
i
m
sure
there
are
contortions
enough
in
michael
angelo
said
madame
grandoni
perhaps
you
don
t
approve
of
oh
michael
angelo
was
not
me
said
roderick
with
sublimity
there
was
a
great
laugh
but
after
all
roderick
had
done
some
fine
things
rowland
had
bidden
one
of
the
servants
bring
him
a
small
portfolio
of
prints
and
had
taken
out
a
photograph
of
roderick
s
little
statue
of
the
youth
drinking
it
pleased
him
to
see
his
friend
sitting
there
in
radiant
ardor
defending
idealism
against
so
knowing
an
apostle
of
corruption
as
gloriani
and
he
wished
to
help
the
elder
artist
to
be
confuted
he
silently
handed
him
the
photograph
bless
me
cried
gloriani
did
he
do
this
ages
ago
said
roderick
gloriani
looked
at
the
photograph
a
long
time
with
evident
admiration
it
s
deucedly
pretty
he
said
at
last
but
my
dear
young
friend
you
can
t
keep
this
i
shall
do
better
said
roderick
you
will
do
worse
you
will
become
weak
you
will
have
to
take
to
violence
to
contortions
to
romanticism
in
this
sort
of
thing
is
like
a
man
trying
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
seat
of
his
trousers
he
may
stand
on
tiptoe
but
he
can
t
do
more
here
you
stand
on
tiptoe
very
gracefully
i
admit
but
you
can
t
fly
there
s
no
use
my
america
shall
answer
you
said
roderick
shaking
toward
him
a
tall
glass
of
champagne
and
drinking
it
down
singleton
had
taken
the
photograph
and
was
poring
over
it
with
a
little
murmur
of
delight
was
this
done
in
america
he
asked
in
a
square
white
wooden
house
at
northampton
massachusetts
roderick
answered
dear
old
white
wooden
houses
said
miss
blanchard
if
you
could
do
as
well
as
this
there
said
singleton
blushing
and
smiling
one
might
say
that
really
you
had
only
to
lose
by
coming
to
mallet
is
to
blame
for
that
said
roderick
but
i
am
willing
to
risk
the
the
photograph
had
been
passed
to
madame
grandoni
it
reminds
me
she
said
of
the
things
a
young
man
used
to
do
whom
i
knew
years
ago
when
i
first
came
to
rome
he
was
a
german
a
pupil
of
overbeck
and
a
votary
of
spiritual
art
he
used
to
wear
a
black
velvet
tunic
and
a
very
low
shirt
collar
he
had
a
neck
like
a
sickly
crane
and
let
his
hair
grow
down
to
his
shoulders
his
name
was
herr
schafgans
he
never
painted
anything
so
profane
as
a
man
taking
a
drink
but
his
figures
were
all
of
the
simple
and
slender
and
angular
pattern
and
nothing
if
not
innocent
like
this
one
of
yours
he
would
not
have
agreed
with
gloriani
any
more
than
you
he
used
to
come
and
see
me
very
often
and
in
those
days
i
thought
his
tunic
and
his
long
neck
infallible
symptoms
of
genius
his
talk
was
all
of
gilded
aureoles
and
beatific
visions
he
lived
on
weak
wine
and
biscuits
and
wore
a
lock
of
saint
somebody
s
hair
in
a
little
bag
round
his
neck
if
he
was
not
a
beato
angelico
it
was
not
his
own
fault
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
hudson
will
do
the
fine
things
he
talks
about
but
he
must
bear
in
mind
the
history
of
dear
schafgans
as
a
warning
against
pretensions
one
fine
day
this
poor
young
man
fell
in
love
with
a
roman
model
though
she
had
never
sat
to
him
i
believe
for
she
was
a
buxom
creature
and
he
painted
none
but
pale
sickly
women
he
offered
to
marry
her
and
she
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
gave
a
shrug
and
consented
but
he
was
ashamed
to
set
up
his
menage
in
rome
they
went
to
naples
and
there
a
couple
of
years
afterwards
i
saw
him
the
poor
fellow
was
ruined
his
wife
used
to
beat
him
and
he
had
taken
to
drinking
he
wore
a
ragged
black
coat
and
he
had
a
blotchy
red
face
madame
had
turned
washerwoman
and
used
to
make
him
go
and
fetch
the
dirty
linen
his
talent
had
gone
heaven
knows
where
he
was
getting
his
living
by
painting
views
of
vesuvius
in
eruption
on
the
little
boxes
they
sell
at
moral
don
t
fall
in
love
with
a
buxom
roman
model
said
roderick
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
story
but
i
don
t
mean
to
fall
in
love
with
any
gloriani
had
possessed
himself
of
the
photograph
again
and
was
looking
at
it
curiously
it
s
a
happy
bit
of
youth
he
said
but
you
can
t
keep
it
up
you
can
t
keep
it
up
the
two
sculptors
pursued
their
discussion
after
dinner
in
the
rowland
left
them
to
have
it
out
in
a
corner
where
roderick
s
eve
stood
over
them
in
the
shaded
lamplight
in
vague
white
beauty
like
the
guardian
angel
of
the
young
idealist
singleton
was
listening
to
madame
grandoni
and
rowland
took
his
place
on
the
sofa
near
miss
blanchard
they
had
a
good
deal
of
familiar
desultory
talk
every
now
and
then
madame
grandoni
looked
round
at
them
miss
blanchard
at
last
asked
rowland
certain
questions
about
roderick
who
he
was
where
he
came
from
whether
it
was
true
as
she
had
heard
that
rowland
had
discovered
him
and
brought
him
out
at
his
own
expense
rowland
answered
her
questions
to
the
last
he
gave
a
vague
affirmative
finally
after
a
pause
looking
at
him
you
re
very
generous
miss
blanchard
said
the
declaration
was
made
with
a
certain
richness
of
tone
but
it
brought
to
rowland
s
sense
neither
delight
nor
confusion
he
had
heard
the
words
before
he
suddenly
remembered
the
grave
sincerity
with
which
miss
garland
had
uttered
them
as
he
strolled
with
her
in
the
woods
the
day
of
roderick
s
picnic
they
had
pleased
him
then
now
he
asked
miss
blanchard
whether
she
would
have
some
tea
when
the
two
ladies
withdrew
he
attended
them
to
their
carriage
coming
back
to
the
he
paused
outside
the
open
door
he
was
struck
by
the
group
formed
by
the
three
men
they
were
standing
before
roderick
s
statue
of
eve
and
the
young
sculptor
had
lifted
up
the
lamp
and
was
showing
different
parts
of
it
to
his
companions
he
was
talking
ardently
and
the
lamplight
covered
his
head
and
face
rowland
stood
looking
on
for
the
group
struck
him
with
its
picturesque
symbolism
roderick
bearing
the
lamp
and
glowing
in
its
radiant
circle
seemed
the
beautiful
image
of
a
genius
which
combined
sincerity
with
power
gloriani
with
his
head
on
one
side
pulling
his
long
moustache
and
looking
keenly
from
eyes
at
the
lighted
marble
represented
art
with
a
worldly
motive
skill
unleavened
by
faith
the
mere
base
maximum
of
cleverness
poor
little
singleton
on
the
other
side
with
his
hands
behind
him
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
following
devoutly
the
course
of
roderick
s
elucidation
might
pass
for
an
embodiment
of
aspiring
candor
with
feeble
wings
to
rise
on
in
all
this
roderick
s
was
certainly
the
beau
role
gloriani
turned
to
rowland
as
he
came
up
and
pointed
back
with
his
thumb
to
the
statue
with
a
smile
half
sardonic
half
a
pretty
thing
a
devilish
pretty
thing
he
said
it
s
as
fresh
as
the
foam
in
the
he
can
do
it
once
he
can
do
it
twice
he
can
do
it
at
a
stretch
half
a
dozen
times
but
but
he
was
returning
to
his
former
refrain
but
rowland
intercepted
him
oh
he
will
keep
it
up
he
said
smiling
i
will
answer
for
gloriani
was
not
encouraging
but
roderick
had
listened
smiling
he
was
floating
unperturbed
on
the
tide
of
his
deep
now
suddenly
however
he
turned
with
a
flash
of
irritation
in
his
eye
and
demanded
in
a
ringing
voice
in
a
word
then
you
prophesy
that
i
am
to
fail
gloriani
answered
imperturbably
patting
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
my
dear
fellow
passion
burns
out
inspiration
runs
to
seed
some
fine
day
every
artist
finds
himself
sitting
face
to
face
with
his
lump
of
clay
with
his
empty
canvas
with
his
sheet
of
blank
paper
waiting
in
vain
for
the
revelation
to
be
made
for
the
muse
to
descend
he
must
learn
to
do
without
the
muse
when
the
fickle
jade
forgets
the
way
to
your
studio
don
t
waste
any
time
in
tearing
your
hair
and
meditating
on
suicide
come
round
and
see
me
and
i
will
show
you
how
to
console
if
i
break
down
said
roderick
passionately
i
shall
stay
down
if
the
muse
deserts
me
she
shall
at
least
have
her
infidelity
on
her
you
have
no
business
rowland
said
to
gloriani
to
talk
lightly
of
the
muse
in
this
company
singleton
too
has
received
pledges
from
her
which
place
her
constancy
beyond
and
he
pointed
out
on
the
wall
near
by
two
small
landscapes
by
the
modest
the
sculptor
examined
them
with
deference
and
singleton
himself
began
to
laugh
nervously
he
was
trembling
with
hope
that
the
great
gloriani
would
be
pleased
yes
these
are
fresh
too
gloriani
said
extraordinarily
fresh
how
old
are
you
sir
said
singleton
for
they
are
famously
fresh
they
must
have
taken
you
a
long
time
you
work
yes
unfortunately
i
work
very
slowly
one
of
them
took
me
six
weeks
the
other
two
upon
my
word
the
muse
pays
you
long
and
gloriani
turned
and
looked
from
head
to
foot
at
so
unlikely
an
object
of
her
favors
singleton
smiled
and
began
to
wipe
his
forehead
very
hard
oh
you
said
the
sculptor
you
ll
keep
it
up
a
week
after
his
rowland
went
into
roderick
s
studio
and
found
him
sitting
before
an
unfinished
piece
of
work
with
a
hanging
head
and
a
heavy
eye
he
could
have
fancied
that
the
fatal
hour
foretold
by
gloriani
had
struck
roderick
rose
with
a
sombre
yawn
and
flung
down
his
tools
it
s
no
use
he
said
i
give
it
up
what
is
it
i
have
struck
a
shallow
i
have
been
sailing
bravely
but
for
the
last
day
or
two
my
keel
has
been
crunching
the
a
difficult
place
rowland
asked
with
a
sympathetic
inflection
looking
vaguely
at
the
roughly
modeled
figure
oh
it
s
not
the
poor
clay
roderick
answered
the
difficult
place
is
here
and
he
struck
a
blow
on
his
heart
i
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
with
me
nothing
comes
all
of
a
sudden
i
hate
things
my
old
things
look
ugly
everything
looks
rowland
was
perplexed
he
was
in
the
situation
of
a
man
who
has
been
riding
a
blood
horse
at
an
even
elastic
gallop
and
of
a
sudden
feels
him
stumble
and
balk
as
yet
he
reflected
he
had
seen
nothing
but
the
sunshine
of
genius
he
had
forgotten
that
it
has
its
storms
of
course
it
had
and
he
felt
a
flood
of
comradeship
rise
in
his
heart
which
would
float
them
both
safely
through
the
worst
weather
why
you
re
tired
he
said
of
course
you
re
tired
you
have
a
right
to
be
do
you
think
i
have
a
right
to
be
roderick
asked
looking
at
him
unquestionably
after
all
you
have
well
then
right
or
wrong
i
am
tired
i
certainly
have
done
a
fair
winter
s
work
i
want
a
rowland
declared
that
it
was
certainly
high
time
they
should
be
leaving
rome
they
would
go
north
and
travel
they
would
go
to
switzerland
to
germany
to
holland
to
england
roderick
assented
his
eye
brightened
and
rowland
talked
of
a
dozen
things
they
might
do
roderick
walked
up
and
down
he
seemed
to
have
something
to
say
which
he
hesitated
to
bring
out
he
hesitated
so
rarely
that
rowland
wondered
and
at
last
asked
him
what
was
on
his
mind
roderick
stopped
before
him
frowning
a
little
i
have
such
unbounded
faith
in
your
he
said
that
i
believe
nothing
i
can
say
would
offend
try
it
said
rowland
well
then
i
think
my
journey
will
do
me
more
good
if
i
take
it
alone
i
need
n
t
say
i
prefer
your
society
to
that
of
any
man
living
for
the
last
six
months
it
has
been
everything
to
me
but
i
have
a
perpetual
feeling
that
you
are
expecting
something
of
me
that
you
are
measuring
my
doings
by
a
terrifically
high
standard
you
are
watching
me
i
don
t
want
to
be
watched
i
want
to
go
my
own
way
to
work
when
i
choose
and
to
loaf
when
i
choose
it
is
not
that
i
don
t
know
what
i
owe
you
it
is
not
that
we
are
not
friends
it
is
simply
that
i
want
a
taste
of
absolutely
unrestricted
freedom
therefore
i
say
let
us
rowland
shook
him
by
the
hand
willingly
do
as
you
desire
i
shall
miss
you
and
i
venture
to
believe
you
ll
pass
some
lonely
hours
but
i
have
only
one
request
to
make
that
if
you
get
into
trouble
of
any
kind
whatever
you
will
immediately
let
me
they
began
their
journey
however
together
and
crossed
the
alps
side
by
side
muffled
in
one
rug
on
the
top
of
the
gothard
coach
rowland
was
going
to
england
to
pay
some
promised
visits
his
companion
had
no
plan
save
to
ramble
through
switzerland
and
germany
as
fancy
guided
him
he
had
money
now
that
would
outlast
the
summer
when
it
was
spent
he
would
come
back
to
rome
and
make
another
statue
at
a
little
mountain
village
by
the
way
roderick
declared
that
he
would
stop
he
would
scramble
about
a
little
in
the
high
places
and
doze
in
the
shade
of
the
pine
forests
the
coach
was
changing
horses
the
two
young
men
walked
along
the
village
street
picking
their
way
between
dunghills
breathing
the
light
cool
air
and
listening
to
the
plash
of
the
fountain
and
the
tinkle
of
the
coach
overtook
them
and
then
rowland
as
he
prepared
to
mount
felt
an
almost
overmastering
reluctance
say
the
word
he
exclaimed
and
i
will
stop
roderick
frowned
ah
you
don
t
trust
me
you
don
t
think
i
m
able
to
take
care
of
myself
that
proves
that
i
was
right
in
feeling
as
if
i
were
watched
watched
my
dear
fellow
said
rowland
i
hope
you
may
never
have
anything
worse
to
complain
of
than
being
watched
in
the
spirit
in
which
i
watch
you
but
i
will
spare
you
even
that
standing
in
his
place
as
the
coach
rolled
away
he
looked
back
at
his
friend
lingering
by
the
roadside
a
great
behind
roderick
was
beginning
to
turn
pink
in
the
sunset
the
young
man
waved
his
hat
still
looking
grave
rowland
settled
himself
in
his
place
reflecting
after
all
that
this
was
a
salubrious
beginning
of
independence
he
was
among
forests
and
glaciers
leaning
on
the
pure
bosom
of
nature
and
then
and
then
was
it
not
in
itself
a
guarantee
against
folly
to
be
engaged
to
mary
garland
chapter
iv
experience
rowland
passed
the
summer
in
england
staying
with
several
old
friends
and
two
or
three
new
ones
on
his
arrival
he
felt
it
on
his
conscience
to
write
to
hudson
and
inform
her
that
her
son
had
relieved
him
of
his
tutelage
he
felt
that
she
considered
him
an
incorruptible
mentor
following
roderick
like
a
shadow
and
he
wished
to
let
her
know
the
truth
but
he
made
the
truth
very
comfortable
and
gave
a
succinct
statement
of
the
young
man
s
brilliant
beginnings
he
owed
it
to
himself
he
said
to
remind
her
that
he
had
not
judged
lightly
and
that
roderick
s
present
achievements
were
more
profitable
than
his
inglorious
drudgery
at
striker
spooner
s
he
was
now
taking
a
holiday
and
proposing
to
see
a
little
of
the
world
he
would
work
none
the
worse
for
this
every
artist
needed
to
knock
about
and
look
at
things
for
himself
they
had
parted
company
for
a
couple
of
months
for
roderick
was
now
a
great
man
and
beyond
the
need
of
going
about
with
a
keeper
but
they
were
to
meet
again
in
rome
in
the
autumn
and
then
he
should
be
able
to
send
her
more
good
news
meanwhile
he
was
very
happy
in
what
roderick
had
already
done
especially
happy
in
the
happiness
it
must
have
brought
to
her
he
ventured
to
ask
to
be
kindly
commended
to
miss
garland
his
letter
was
promptly
answered
to
his
surprise
in
miss
garland
s
own
hand
the
same
mail
brought
also
an
epistle
from
cecilia
the
latter
was
voluminous
and
we
must
content
ourselves
with
giving
an
extract
your
letter
was
filled
with
an
echo
of
that
brilliant
roman
world
which
made
me
almost
ill
with
envy
for
a
week
after
i
got
it
i
thought
northampton
really
unpardonably
tame
but
i
am
drifting
back
again
to
my
old
deeps
of
resignation
and
i
rush
to
the
window
when
any
one
passes
with
all
my
old
gratitude
for
small
favors
so
roderick
hudson
is
already
a
great
man
and
you
turn
out
to
be
a
great
prophet
my
compliments
to
both
of
you
i
never
heard
of
anything
working
so
smoothly
and
he
takes
it
all
very
quietly
and
does
n
t
lose
his
balance
nor
let
it
turn
his
head
you
judged
him
then
in
a
day
better
than
i
had
done
in
six
months
for
i
really
did
not
expect
that
he
would
settle
down
into
such
a
of
prosperity
i
believed
he
would
do
fine
things
but
i
was
sure
he
would
intersperse
them
with
a
good
many
follies
and
that
his
beautiful
statues
would
spring
up
out
of
the
midst
of
a
straggling
plantation
of
wild
oats
but
from
what
you
tell
me
striker
may
now
go
hang
himself
there
is
one
thing
however
to
say
as
a
friend
in
the
way
of
warning
that
candid
soul
can
keep
a
secret
and
he
may
have
private
designs
on
your
equanimity
which
you
don
t
begin
to
suspect
what
do
you
think
of
his
being
engaged
to
miss
garland
the
two
ladies
had
given
no
hint
of
it
all
winter
but
a
fortnight
ago
when
those
big
photographs
of
his
statues
arrived
they
first
pinned
them
up
on
the
wall
and
then
trotted
out
into
the
town
made
a
dozen
calls
and
announced
the
news
hudson
did
at
least
miss
garland
i
suppose
sat
at
home
writing
letters
to
me
i
confess
the
thing
was
a
perfect
surprise
i
had
not
a
suspicion
that
all
the
while
he
was
coming
so
regularly
to
make
himself
agreeable
on
my
veranda
he
was
quietly
preferring
his
cousin
to
any
one
else
not
indeed
that
he
was
ever
at
particular
pains
to
make
himself
agreeable
i
suppose
he
has
picked
up
a
few
graces
in
rome
but
he
must
not
acquire
too
many
if
he
is
too
polite
when
he
comes
back
miss
garland
will
count
him
as
one
of
the
lost
she
will
be
a
very
good
wife
for
a
man
of
genius
and
such
a
one
as
they
are
often
shrewd
enough
to
take
she
ll
darn
his
stockings
and
keep
his
accounts
and
sit
at
home
and
trim
the
lamp
and
keep
up
the
fire
while
he
studies
the
beautiful
in
pretty
neighbors
at
the
two
ladies
are
evidently
very
happy
and
to
do
them
justice
very
humbly
grateful
to
you
hudson
never
speaks
of
you
without
tears
in
her
eyes
and
i
am
sure
she
considers
you
a
specially
patented
agent
of
providence
verily
it
s
a
good
thing
for
a
woman
to
be
in
love
miss
garland
has
grown
almost
pretty
i
met
her
the
other
night
at
a
she
had
a
white
rose
in
her
hair
and
sang
a
sentimental
ballad
in
a
fine
contralto
miss
garland
s
letter
was
so
much
shorter
that
we
may
give
it
entire
my
dear
sir
hudson
as
i
suppose
you
know
has
been
for
some
time
unable
to
use
her
eyes
she
requests
me
therefore
to
answer
your
favor
of
the
of
june
she
thanks
you
extremely
for
writing
and
wishes
me
to
say
that
she
considers
herself
in
every
way
under
great
obligations
to
you
your
account
of
her
son
s
progress
and
the
high
estimation
in
which
he
is
held
has
made
her
very
happy
and
she
earnestly
prays
that
all
may
continue
well
with
him
he
sent
us
a
short
time
ago
several
large
photographs
of
his
two
statues
taken
from
different
points
of
view
we
know
little
about
such
things
but
they
seem
to
us
wonderfully
beautiful
we
sent
them
to
boston
to
be
handsomely
framed
and
the
man
on
returning
them
wrote
us
that
he
had
exhibited
them
for
a
week
in
his
store
and
that
they
had
attracted
great
attention
the
frames
are
magnificent
and
the
pictures
now
hang
in
a
row
on
the
parlor
wall
our
only
quarrel
with
them
is
that
they
make
the
old
papering
and
the
engravings
look
dreadfully
shabby
striker
stood
and
looked
at
them
the
other
day
full
five
minutes
and
said
at
last
that
if
roderick
s
head
was
running
on
such
things
it
was
no
wonder
he
could
not
learn
to
draw
up
a
deed
we
lead
here
so
quiet
and
monotonous
a
life
that
i
am
afraid
i
can
tell
you
nothing
that
will
interest
you
hudson
requests
me
to
say
that
the
little
more
or
less
that
may
happen
to
us
is
of
small
account
as
we
live
in
our
thoughts
and
our
thoughts
are
fixed
on
her
dear
son
she
thanks
heaven
he
has
so
good
a
friend
hudson
says
that
this
is
too
short
a
letter
but
i
can
say
nothing
more
yours
most
respectfully
mary
garland
it
is
a
question
whether
the
reader
will
know
why
but
this
letter
gave
rowland
extraordinary
pleasure
he
liked
its
very
brevity
and
meagreness
and
there
seemed
to
him
an
exquisite
modesty
in
its
saying
nothing
from
the
young
girl
herself
he
delighted
in
the
formal
address
and
conclusion
they
pleased
him
as
he
had
been
pleased
by
an
angular
gesture
in
some
expressive
girlish
figure
in
an
early
painting
the
letter
renewed
that
impression
of
strong
feeling
combined
with
an
almost
rigid
simplicity
which
roderick
s
betrothed
had
personally
given
him
and
its
homely
stiffness
seemed
a
vivid
reflection
of
a
life
concentrated
as
the
young
girl
had
borrowed
warrant
from
her
companion
to
say
in
a
single
devoted
idea
the
monotonous
days
of
the
two
women
seemed
to
rowland
s
fancy
to
follow
each
other
like
the
of
a
great
marking
off
the
hours
which
separated
them
from
the
supreme
felicity
of
clasping
the
son
and
lover
to
lips
sealed
with
the
excess
of
joy
he
hoped
that
roderick
now
that
he
had
shaken
off
the
oppression
of
his
own
importunate
faith
was
not
losing
a
tolerant
temper
for
the
silent
prayers
of
the
two
women
at
northampton
he
was
left
to
vain
conjectures
however
as
to
roderick
s
actual
moods
and
occupations
he
knew
he
was
no
and
that
in
the
young
sculptor
s
own
phrase
he
had
at
any
time
rather
build
a
monument
than
write
a
note
but
when
a
month
had
passed
without
news
of
him
he
began
to
be
half
anxious
and
half
angry
and
wrote
him
three
lines
in
the
care
of
a
continental
banker
begging
him
at
least
to
give
some
sign
of
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
a
week
afterwards
came
an
answer
brief
and
dated
i
know
i
have
been
a
great
brute
roderick
wrote
not
to
have
sent
you
a
word
before
but
really
i
don
t
know
what
has
got
into
me
i
have
lately
learned
terribly
well
how
to
be
idle
i
am
afraid
to
think
how
long
it
is
since
i
wrote
to
my
mother
or
to
mary
heaven
help
them
poor
patient
trustful
creatures
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
what
i
am
doing
it
seems
all
amusing
enough
while
i
do
it
but
it
would
make
a
poor
show
in
a
narrative
intended
for
your
formidable
eyes
i
found
baxter
in
switzerland
or
rather
he
found
me
and
he
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
and
brought
me
here
i
was
walking
twenty
miles
a
day
in
the
alps
drinking
milk
in
lonely
chalets
sleeping
as
you
sleep
and
thinking
it
was
all
very
good
fun
but
baxter
told
me
it
would
never
do
that
the
alps
were
d
d
rot
that
was
the
place
and
that
if
i
knew
what
was
good
for
me
i
would
come
along
with
him
it
is
a
wonderful
place
certainly
though
thank
the
lord
baxter
departed
last
week
blaspheming
horribly
at
trente
et
quarante
but
you
know
all
about
it
and
what
one
does
what
one
is
liable
to
do
i
have
succumbed
in
a
measure
to
the
liabilities
and
i
wish
i
had
some
one
here
to
give
me
a
thundering
good
blowing
up
not
you
dear
friend
you
would
draw
it
too
mild
you
have
too
much
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
i
have
fits
of
horrible
homesickness
for
my
studio
and
i
shall
be
devoutly
grateful
when
the
summer
is
over
and
i
can
go
back
and
swing
a
chisel
i
feel
as
if
nothing
but
the
chisel
would
satisfy
me
as
if
i
could
rush
in
a
rage
at
a
block
of
unshaped
marble
there
are
a
lot
of
the
roman
people
here
english
and
american
i
live
in
the
midst
of
them
and
talk
nonsense
from
morning
till
night
there
is
also
some
one
else
and
to
her
i
don
t
talk
sense
nor
thank
heaven
mean
what
i
say
i
confess
i
need
a
month
s
work
to
recover
my
these
lines
brought
rowland
no
small
perturbation
the
more
that
what
they
seemed
to
point
to
surprised
him
during
the
nine
months
of
their
companionship
roderick
had
shown
so
little
taste
for
dissipation
that
rowland
had
come
to
think
of
it
as
a
canceled
danger
and
it
greatly
perplexed
him
to
learn
that
his
friend
had
apparently
proved
so
pliant
to
opportunity
but
roderick
s
allusions
were
ambiguous
and
it
was
possible
they
might
simply
mean
that
he
was
out
of
patience
with
a
frivolous
way
of
life
and
fretting
wholesomely
over
his
absent
work
it
was
a
very
good
thing
certainly
that
idleness
should
prove
on
experiment
to
sit
heavily
on
his
conscience
nevertheless
the
letter
needed
to
rowland
s
mind
a
key
the
key
arrived
a
week
later
in
common
charity
roderick
wrote
lend
me
a
hundred
pounds
i
have
gambled
away
my
last
franc
i
have
made
a
mountain
of
debts
send
me
the
money
first
lecture
me
afterwards
rowland
sent
the
money
by
return
of
mail
then
he
proceeded
not
to
lecture
but
to
think
he
hung
his
head
he
was
acutely
disappointed
he
had
no
right
to
be
he
assured
himself
but
so
it
was
roderick
was
young
impulsive
unpracticed
in
stoicism
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
was
to
pay
the
usual
vulgar
tribute
to
folly
but
his
friend
had
regarded
it
as
securely
gained
to
his
own
belief
in
virtue
that
he
was
not
as
other
foolish
youths
are
and
that
he
would
have
been
capable
of
looking
at
folly
in
the
face
and
passing
on
his
way
rowland
for
a
while
felt
a
sore
sense
of
wrath
what
right
had
a
man
who
was
engaged
to
that
fine
girl
in
northampton
to
behave
as
if
his
consciousness
were
a
common
blank
to
be
overlaid
with
coarse
sensations
yes
distinctly
he
was
disappointed
he
had
accompanied
his
missive
with
an
urgent
recommendation
to
leave
immediately
and
an
offer
to
meet
roderick
at
any
point
he
would
name
the
answer
came
promptly
it
ran
as
follows
send
me
another
fifty
pounds
i
have
been
back
to
the
tables
i
will
leave
as
soon
as
the
money
comes
and
meet
you
at
geneva
there
i
will
tell
you
there
is
an
ancient
terrace
at
geneva
planted
with
trees
and
studded
with
benches
overlooked
by
gravely
aristocratic
old
dwellings
and
overlooking
the
distant
alps
a
great
many
generations
have
made
it
a
a
great
many
friends
and
lovers
strolled
there
a
great
many
confidential
talks
and
momentous
interviews
gone
forward
here
one
morning
sitting
on
one
of
the
battered
green
benches
roderick
as
he
had
promised
told
his
friend
everything
he
had
arrived
late
the
night
before
he
looked
tired
and
yet
flushed
and
excited
he
made
no
professions
of
penitence
but
he
practiced
an
unmitigated
frankness
and
his
might
be
taken
for
granted
he
implied
in
every
phrase
that
he
had
done
with
it
all
and
that
he
was
counting
the
hours
till
he
could
get
back
to
work
we
shall
not
rehearse
his
confession
in
detail
its
main
outline
will
be
sufficient
he
had
fallen
in
with
some
very
idle
people
and
had
discovered
that
a
little
example
and
a
little
practice
were
capable
of
producing
on
his
own
part
a
considerable
relish
for
their
diversions
what
could
he
do
he
never
read
and
he
had
no
studio
in
one
way
or
another
he
had
to
pass
the
time
he
passed
it
in
dangling
about
several
very
pretty
women
in
wonderful
paris
toilets
and
reflected
that
it
was
always
something
gained
for
a
sculptor
to
sit
under
a
tree
looking
at
his
leisure
into
a
charming
face
and
saying
things
that
made
it
smile
and
play
its
muscles
and
part
its
lips
and
show
its
teeth
attached
to
these
ladies
were
certain
gentlemen
who
walked
about
in
clouds
of
perfume
rose
at
midday
and
supped
at
midnight
roderick
had
found
himself
in
the
mood
for
thinking
them
very
amusing
fellows
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
taste
but
he
let
it
take
its
course
it
led
him
to
the
discovery
that
to
live
with
ladies
who
expect
you
to
present
them
with
expensive
bouquets
to
ride
with
them
in
the
black
forest
on
horses
to
come
into
their
on
nights
when
patti
sang
and
prices
were
consequent
to
propose
little
light
suppers
at
the
conversation
house
after
the
opera
or
drives
by
moonlight
to
the
castle
to
be
always
arrayed
and
anointed
trinketed
and
gloved
that
to
move
in
such
society
we
say
though
it
might
be
a
privilege
was
a
privilege
with
a
penalty
attached
but
the
tables
made
such
things
easy
half
the
baden
world
lived
by
the
tables
roderick
tried
them
and
found
that
at
first
they
smoothed
his
path
delightfully
this
simplification
of
matters
however
was
only
momentary
for
he
soon
perceived
that
to
seem
to
have
money
and
to
have
it
in
fact
exposed
a
young
man
to
peculiar
liabilities
at
this
point
of
his
friend
s
narrative
rowland
was
reminded
of
madame
de
cruchecassee
in
the
newcomes
and
though
he
had
listened
in
tranquil
silence
to
the
rest
of
it
he
found
it
hard
not
to
say
that
all
this
had
been
under
the
circumstances
a
very
bad
business
roderick
admitted
it
with
bitterness
and
then
told
how
much
measured
simply
financially
it
had
cost
him
his
luck
had
changed
the
tables
had
ceased
to
back
him
and
he
had
found
himself
up
to
his
knees
in
debt
every
penny
had
gone
of
the
solid
sum
which
had
seemed
a
large
equivalent
of
those
shining
statues
in
rome
he
had
been
an
ass
but
it
was
not
irreparable
he
could
make
another
statue
in
a
couple
of
months
rowland
frowned
for
heaven
s
sake
he
said
don
t
play
such
dangerous
games
with
your
facility
if
you
have
got
facility
revere
it
respect
it
adore
it
treasure
it
don
t
speculate
on
and
he
wondered
what
his
companion
up
to
his
knees
in
debt
would
have
done
if
there
had
been
no
rowland
mallet
to
lend
a
helping
hand
but
he
did
not
formulate
his
curiosity
audibly
and
the
contingency
seemed
not
to
have
presented
itself
to
roderick
s
imagination
the
young
sculptor
reverted
to
his
late
adventures
again
in
the
evening
and
this
time
talked
of
them
more
objectively
as
the
phrase
is
more
as
if
they
had
been
the
adventures
of
another
person
he
related
half
a
dozen
droll
things
that
had
happened
to
him
and
as
if
his
responsibility
had
been
disengaged
by
all
this
free
discussion
he
laughed
extravagantly
at
the
memory
of
them
rowland
sat
perfectly
grave
on
principle
then
roderick
began
to
talk
of
half
a
dozen
statues
that
he
had
in
his
head
and
set
forth
his
design
with
his
usual
vividness
suddenly
as
it
was
relevant
he
declared
that
his
baden
doings
had
not
been
altogether
fruitless
for
that
the
lady
who
had
reminded
rowland
of
madame
de
cruchecassee
was
tremendously
statuesque
rowland
at
last
said
that
it
all
might
pass
if
he
felt
that
he
was
really
the
wiser
for
it
by
the
wiser
he
added
i
mean
the
stronger
in
purpose
in
oh
don
t
talk
about
will
roderick
answered
throwing
back
his
head
and
looking
at
the
stars
this
conversation
also
took
place
in
the
open
air
on
the
little
island
in
the
shooting
rhone
where
has
a
monument
the
will
i
believe
is
the
mystery
of
mysteries
who
can
answer
for
his
will
who
can
say
beforehand
that
it
s
strong
there
are
all
kinds
of
indefinable
currents
moving
to
and
fro
between
one
s
will
and
one
s
inclinations
people
talk
as
if
the
two
things
were
essentially
distinct
on
different
sides
of
one
s
organism
like
the
heart
and
the
liver
mine
i
know
are
much
nearer
together
it
all
depends
upon
circumstances
i
believe
there
is
a
certain
group
of
circumstances
possible
for
every
man
in
which
his
will
is
destined
to
snap
like
a
dry
my
dear
boy
said
rowland
don
t
talk
about
the
will
being
the
will
is
destiny
itself
that
s
the
way
to
look
at
look
at
it
my
dear
rowland
roderick
answered
as
you
find
most
comfortable
one
conviction
i
have
gathered
from
my
summer
s
experience
he
went
on
it
s
as
well
to
look
it
frankly
in
the
face
is
that
i
possess
an
almost
unlimited
susceptibility
to
the
influence
of
a
beautiful
rowland
stared
then
strolled
away
softly
whistling
to
himself
he
was
unwilling
to
admit
even
to
himself
that
this
speech
had
really
the
sinister
meaning
it
seemed
to
have
in
a
few
days
the
two
young
men
made
their
way
back
to
italy
and
lingered
a
while
in
florence
before
going
on
to
rome
in
florence
roderick
seemed
to
have
won
back
his
old
innocence
and
his
preference
for
the
pleasures
of
study
over
any
others
rowland
began
to
think
of
the
baden
episode
as
a
bad
dream
or
at
the
worst
as
a
mere
sporadic
piece
of
disorder
without
roots
in
his
companion
s
character
they
passed
a
fortnight
looking
at
pictures
and
exploring
for
out
the
way
bits
of
fresco
and
carving
and
roderick
recovered
all
his
earlier
fervor
of
appreciation
and
comment
in
rome
he
went
eagerly
to
work
again
and
finished
in
a
month
two
or
three
small
things
he
had
left
standing
on
his
departure
he
talked
the
most
joyous
nonsense
about
finding
himself
back
in
his
old
quarters
on
the
first
sunday
afternoon
following
their
return
on
their
going
together
to
saint
peter
s
he
delivered
himself
of
a
lyrical
greeting
to
the
great
church
and
to
the
city
in
general
in
a
tone
of
voice
so
irrepressibly
elevated
that
it
rang
through
the
nave
in
rather
a
scandalous
fashion
and
almost
arrested
a
procession
of
canons
who
were
marching
across
to
the
choir
he
began
to
model
a
new
statue
a
female
figure
of
which
he
had
said
nothing
to
rowland
it
represented
a
woman
leaning
lazily
back
in
her
chair
with
her
head
drooping
as
if
she
were
listening
a
vague
smile
on
her
lips
and
a
pair
of
remarkably
beautiful
arms
folded
in
her
lap
with
rather
less
softness
of
contour
it
would
have
resembled
the
noble
statue
of
agrippina
in
the
capitol
rowland
looked
at
it
and
was
not
sure
he
liked
it
who
is
it
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
anything
you
please
said
roderick
with
a
certain
petulance
i
call
it
a
rowland
then
remembered
that
one
of
the
baden
ladies
had
been
statuesque
and
asked
no
more
questions
this
after
all
was
a
way
of
profiting
by
experience
a
few
days
later
he
took
his
first
ride
of
the
season
on
the
campagna
and
as
on
his
homeward
way
he
was
passing
across
the
long
shadow
of
a
ruined
tower
he
perceived
a
small
figure
at
a
short
distance
bent
over
a
as
he
drew
near
he
recognized
his
friend
singleton
the
honest
little
painter
s
face
was
scorched
to
by
the
light
of
southern
suns
and
borrowed
an
even
deeper
crimson
from
his
gleeful
greeting
of
his
most
appreciative
patron
he
was
making
a
careful
and
charming
little
sketch
on
rowland
s
asking
him
how
he
had
spent
his
summer
he
gave
an
account
of
his
wanderings
which
made
poor
mallet
sigh
with
a
sense
of
more
contrasts
than
one
he
had
not
been
out
of
italy
but
he
had
been
delving
deep
into
the
picturesque
heart
of
the
lovely
land
and
gathering
a
wonderful
store
of
subjects
he
had
rambled
about
among
the
unvisited
villages
of
the
apennines
pencil
in
hand
and
knapsack
on
back
sleeping
on
straw
and
eating
black
bread
and
beans
but
feasting
on
local
color
rioting
as
it
were
on
chiaroscuro
and
laying
up
a
treasure
of
pictorial
observations
he
took
a
devout
satisfaction
in
his
wisdom
and
his
happy
frugality
rowland
went
the
next
day
by
appointment
to
look
at
his
sketches
and
spent
a
whole
morning
turning
them
over
singleton
talked
more
than
he
had
ever
done
before
explained
them
all
and
told
some
quaintly
humorous
anecdote
about
the
production
of
each
dear
me
how
i
have
chattered
he
said
at
last
i
am
afraid
you
had
rather
have
looked
at
the
things
in
peace
and
quiet
i
did
n
t
know
i
could
talk
so
much
but
somehow
i
feel
very
happy
i
feel
as
if
i
had
that
you
have
said
rowland
i
doubt
whether
an
artist
ever
passed
a
more
profitable
three
months
you
must
feel
much
more
sure
of
singleton
looked
for
a
long
time
with
great
intentness
at
a
knot
in
the
floor
yes
he
said
at
last
in
a
fluttered
tone
i
feel
much
more
sure
of
myself
i
have
got
more
facility
and
he
lowered
his
voice
as
if
he
were
communicating
a
secret
which
it
took
some
courage
to
impart
i
hardly
like
to
say
it
for
fear
i
should
after
all
be
mistaken
but
since
it
strikes
you
perhaps
it
s
true
it
s
a
great
happiness
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
a
great
deal
of
yes
i
suppose
it
s
a
great
happiness
said
rowland
i
shall
really
think
of
you
as
living
here
in
a
state
of
scandalous
bliss
i
don
t
believe
it
s
good
for
an
artist
to
be
in
such
brutally
high
singleton
stared
for
a
moment
as
if
he
thought
rowland
was
in
earnest
then
suddenly
fathoming
the
kindly
jest
he
walked
about
the
room
scratching
his
head
and
laughing
intensely
to
himself
and
hudson
he
said
as
rowland
was
going
i
hope
he
is
well
and
he
is
very
well
said
rowland
he
is
back
at
work
ah
there
s
a
man
cried
singleton
who
has
taken
his
start
once
for
all
and
does
n
t
need
to
stop
and
ask
himself
in
fear
and
trembling
every
month
or
two
whether
he
is
advancing
or
not
when
he
stops
it
s
to
rest
and
where
did
he
spend
his
summer
the
greater
part
of
it
at
ah
that
s
in
the
black
forest
cried
singleton
with
profound
simplicity
they
say
you
can
make
capital
studies
of
trees
no
doubt
said
rowland
with
a
smile
laying
an
almost
paternal
hand
on
the
little
painter
s
yellow
head
unfortunately
trees
are
not
roderick
s
line
nevertheless
he
tells
me
that
at
baden
he
made
some
studies
come
when
you
can
by
the
way
he
added
after
a
moment
to
his
studio
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
something
he
has
lately
singleton
declared
that
he
would
come
delightedly
and
rowland
left
him
to
his
work
he
met
a
number
of
his
last
winter
s
friends
again
and
called
upon
madame
grandoni
upon
miss
blanchard
and
upon
gloriani
shortly
after
their
return
the
ladies
gave
an
excellent
account
of
themselves
madame
grandoni
had
been
taking
at
rimini
and
miss
blanchard
painting
wild
flowers
in
the
tyrol
her
complexion
was
somewhat
browned
which
was
very
becoming
and
her
flowers
were
uncommonly
pretty
gloriani
had
been
in
paris
and
had
come
away
in
high
finding
no
one
there
in
the
cleverer
than
himself
he
came
in
a
few
days
to
roderick
s
studio
one
afternoon
when
rowland
was
present
he
examined
the
new
statue
with
great
deference
said
it
was
very
promising
and
abstained
considerately
from
irritating
prophecies
but
rowland
fancied
he
observed
certain
signs
of
inward
jubilation
on
the
clever
sculptor
s
part
and
walked
away
with
him
to
learn
his
private
opinion
certainly
i
liked
it
as
well
as
i
said
gloriani
declared
in
answer
to
rowland
s
anxious
query
or
rather
i
liked
it
a
great
deal
better
i
did
n
t
say
how
much
for
fear
of
making
your
friend
angry
but
one
can
leave
him
alone
now
for
he
s
coming
round
i
told
you
he
could
n
t
keep
up
the
transcendental
style
and
he
has
already
broken
down
don
t
you
see
it
yourself
man
i
don
t
particularly
like
this
new
statue
said
rowland
that
s
because
you
re
a
purist
it
s
deuced
clever
it
s
deuced
knowing
it
s
deuced
pretty
but
it
is
n
t
the
topping
high
art
of
three
months
ago
he
has
taken
his
turn
sooner
than
i
supposed
what
has
happened
to
him
has
he
been
disappointed
in
love
but
that
s
none
of
my
business
i
congratulate
him
on
having
become
a
practical
roderick
however
was
less
to
be
congratulated
than
gloriani
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
believe
he
was
discontented
with
his
work
he
applied
himself
to
it
by
fits
and
starts
he
declared
that
he
did
n
t
know
what
was
coming
over
him
he
was
turning
into
a
man
of
moods
is
this
of
necessity
what
a
fellow
must
come
to
he
asked
of
rowland
with
a
sort
of
peremptory
flash
in
his
eye
which
seemed
to
imply
that
his
companion
had
undertaken
to
insure
him
against
perplexities
and
was
not
fulfilling
his
contract
this
damnable
uncertainty
when
he
goes
to
bed
at
night
as
to
whether
he
is
going
to
wake
up
in
a
working
humor
or
in
a
swearing
humor
have
we
only
a
season
over
before
we
know
it
in
which
we
can
call
our
faculties
our
own
six
months
ago
i
could
stand
up
to
my
work
like
a
man
day
after
day
and
never
dream
of
asking
myself
whether
i
felt
like
it
but
now
some
mornings
it
s
the
very
devil
to
get
going
my
statue
looks
so
bad
when
i
come
into
the
studio
that
i
have
twenty
minds
to
smash
it
on
the
spot
and
i
lose
three
or
four
hours
in
sitting
there
moping
and
getting
used
to
rowland
said
that
he
supposed
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
the
lot
of
every
artist
and
that
the
only
remedy
was
plenty
of
courage
and
faith
and
he
reminded
him
of
gloriani
s
having
forewarned
him
against
these
sterile
moods
the
year
before
gloriani
s
an
ass
said
roderick
almost
fiercely
he
hired
a
horse
and
began
to
ride
with
rowland
on
the
campagna
this
delicious
amusement
restored
him
in
a
measure
to
cheerfulness
but
seemed
to
rowland
on
the
whole
not
to
stimulate
his
industry
their
rides
were
always
very
long
and
roderick
insisted
on
making
them
longer
by
dismounting
in
picturesque
spots
and
stretching
himself
in
the
sun
among
a
heap
of
overtangled
stones
he
let
the
scorching
roman
luminary
beat
down
upon
him
with
an
equanimity
which
rowland
found
it
hard
to
emulate
but
in
this
situation
roderick
talked
so
much
amusing
nonsense
that
for
the
sake
of
his
company
rowland
consented
to
be
uncomfortable
and
often
forgot
that
though
in
these
diversions
the
days
passed
quickly
they
brought
forth
neither
high
art
nor
low
and
yet
it
was
perhaps
by
their
help
after
all
that
roderick
secured
several
mornings
of
ardent
work
on
his
new
figure
and
brought
it
to
rapid
completion
one
afternoon
when
it
was
finished
rowland
went
to
look
at
it
and
roderick
asked
him
for
his
opinion
what
do
you
think
yourself
rowland
demanded
not
from
pusillanimity
but
from
real
uncertainty
i
think
it
is
curiously
bad
roderick
answered
it
was
bad
from
the
first
it

vices
i
have
shuffled
them
in
a
measure
out
of
sight
but
i
have
not
corrected
them

he
cried
passionately
they
stare
me
in
the
face
they
are
all
i
see
rowland
offered
several
criticisms
of
detail
and
suggested
certain
practicable
changes
but
roderick
differed
with
him
on
each
of
these
points
the
thing
had
faults
enough
but
they
were
not
those
faults
rowland
unruffled
concluded
by
saying
that
whatever
its
faults
might
be
he
had
an
idea
people
in
general
would
like
it
i
wish
to
heaven
some
person
in
particular
would
buy
it
and
take
it
off
my
hands
and
out
of
my
sight
roderick
cried
what
am
i
to
do
now
he
went
on
i
have
n
t
an
idea
i
think
of
subjects
but
they
remain
mere
lifeless
names
they
are
mere
words
they
are
not
images
what
am
i
to
do
rowland
was
a
trifle
annoyed
be
a
man
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
and
don
t
for
heaven
s
sake
talk
in
that
confoundedly
querulous
but
before
he
had
uttered
the
words
there
rang
through
the
studio
a
loud
peremptory
ring
at
the
outer
door
roderick
broke
into
a
laugh
talk
of
the
devil
he
said
and
you
see
his
horns
if
that
s
not
a
customer
it
ought
to
the
door
of
the
studio
was
promptly
flung
open
and
a
lady
advanced
to
the
threshold
an
imposing
voluminous
person
who
quite
filled
up
the
doorway
rowland
immediately
felt
that
he
had
seen
her
before
but
he
recognized
her
only
when
she
moved
forward
and
disclosed
an
attendant
in
the
person
of
a
little
elderly
gentleman
with
a
bristling
white
moustache
then
he
remembered
that
just
a
year
before
he
and
his
companion
had
seen
in
the
ludovisi
gardens
a
wonderfully
beautiful
girl
strolling
in
the
train
of
this
conspicuous
couple
he
looked
for
her
now
and
in
a
moment
she
appeared
following
her
companions
with
the
same
nonchalant
step
as
before
and
leading
her
great
poodle
decorated
with
motley
ribbons
the
elder
lady
offered
the
two
young
men
a
sufficiently
gracious
salute
the
little
old
gentleman
bowed
and
smiled
with
extreme
alertness
the
young
girl
without
casting
a
glance
either
at
roderick
or
at
rowland
looked
about
for
a
chair
and
on
perceiving
one
sank
into
it
listlessly
pulled
her
poodle
towards
her
and
began
to
rearrange
his
rowland
saw
that
even
with
her
eyes
dropped
her
beauty
was
still
dazzling
i
trust
we
are
at
liberty
to
enter
said
the
elder
lady
with
majesty
we
were
told
that
hudson
had
no
fixed
day
and
that
we
might
come
at
any
time
let
us
not
disturb
roderick
as
one
of
the
lesser
lights
of
the
roman
had
not
hitherto
been
subject
to
incursions
from
inquisitive
tourists
and
having
no
regular
reception
day
was
not
versed
in
the
usual
formulas
of
welcome
he
said
nothing
and
rowland
looking
at
him
saw
that
he
was
looking
amazedly
at
the
young
girl
and
was
apparently
unconscious
of
everything
else
by
jove
he
cried
precipitately
it
s
that
goddess
of
the
villa
ludovisi
rowland
in
some
confusion
did
the
honors
as
he
could
but
the
little
old
gentleman
begged
him
with
the
most
obsequious
of
smiles
to
give
himself
no
trouble
i
have
been
in
many
a
studio
he
said
with
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
a
strong
italian
accent
we
are
going
about
everywhere
said
his
companion
i
am
passionately
fond
of
art
rowland
smiled
sympathetically
and
let
them
turn
to
roderick
s
statue
he
glanced
again
at
the
young
sculptor
to
invite
him
to
bestir
himself
but
roderick
was
still
gazing
at
the
beautiful
young
mistress
of
the
poodle
who
by
this
time
had
looked
up
and
was
gazing
straight
at
him
there
was
nothing
bold
in
her
look
it
expressed
a
kind
of
languid
imperturbable
indifference
her
beauty
was
extraordinary
it
grew
and
grew
as
the
young
man
observed
her
in
such
a
face
the
maidenly
custom
of
averted
eyes
and
ready
blushes
would
have
seemed
an
anomaly
nature
had
produced
it
for
man
s
delight
and
meant
that
it
should
surrender
itself
freely
and
coldly
to
admiration
it
was
not
immediately
apparent
however
that
the
young
lady
found
an
answering
entertainment
in
the
physiognomy
of
her
host
she
turned
her
head
after
a
moment
and
looked
idly
round
the
room
and
at
last
let
her
eyes
rest
on
the
statue
of
the
woman
seated
it
being
left
to
rowland
to
stimulate
conversation
he
began
by
complimenting
her
on
the
beauty
of
her
dog
yes
he
s
very
handsome
she
murmured
he
s
a
florentine
the
dogs
in
florence
are
handsomer
than
the
and
on
rowland
s
caressing
him
his
name
is
stenterello
she
added
stenterello
give
your
hand
to
the
this
order
was
given
in
italian
say
buon
giorno
a
stenterello
thrust
out
his
paw
and
gave
four
short
shrill
barks
upon
which
the
elder
lady
turned
round
and
raised
her
forefinger
my
dear
my
dear
remember
where
you
are
excuse
my
foolish
child
she
added
turning
to
roderick
with
an
agreeable
smile
she
can
think
of
nothing
but
her
i
am
teaching
him
to
talk
for
me
the
young
girl
went
on
without
heeding
her
mother
to
say
little
things
in
society
it
will
save
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
stenterello
love
give
a
pretty
smile
and
say
tanti
complimenti
the
poodle
wagged
his
white
pate
it
looked
like
one
of
those
little
pads
in
swan
for
applying
powder
to
the
face
and
repeated
the
barking
process
he
is
a
wonderful
beast
said
rowland
he
is
not
a
beast
said
the
young
girl
a
beast
is
something
black
and
dirty
something
you
can
t
he
is
a
very
valuable
dog
the
elder
lady
explained
he
was
presented
to
my
daughter
by
a
florentine
it
is
not
for
that
i
care
about
him
it
is
for
himself
he
is
better
than
the
my
dear
my
dear
repeated
the
mother
in
deprecating
accents
but
with
a
significant
glance
at
rowland
which
seemed
to
bespeak
his
attention
to
the
glory
of
possessing
a
daughter
who
could
deal
in
that
fashion
with
the
aristocracy
rowland
remembered
that
when
their
unknown
visitors
had
passed
before
them
a
year
previous
in
the
villa
ludovisi
roderick
and
he
had
exchanged
conjectures
as
to
their
nationality
and
social
quality
roderick
had
declared
that
they
were
people
but
rowland
now
needed
no
telling
to
feel
that
he
might
claim
the
elder
lady
as
a
she
was
a
person
of
what
is
called
a
great
deal
of
presence
with
the
faded
traces
artfully
revived
here
and
there
of
once
brilliant
beauty
her
daughter
had
come
lawfully
by
her
loveliness
but
rowland
mentally
made
the
distinction
that
the
mother
was
silly
and
that
the
daughter
was
not
the
mother
had
a
very
silly
mouth
a
mouth
rowland
suspected
capable
of
expressing
an
inordinate
degree
of
unreason
the
young
girl
in
spite
of
her
childish
satisfaction
in
her
poodle
was
not
a
person
of
feeble
understanding
rowland
received
an
impression
that
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
was
playing
a
part
what
was
the
part
and
what
were
her
reasons
she
was
interesting
rowland
wondered
what
were
her
domestic
secrets
if
her
mother
was
a
daughter
of
the
great
republic
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
the
young
girl
was
a
flower
of
the
american
soil
but
her
beauty
had
a
robustness
and
tone
uncommon
in
the
somewhat
facile
loveliness
of
our
western
maidenhood
she
spoke
with
a
vague
foreign
accent
as
if
she
had
spent
her
life
in
strange
countries
the
little
italian
apparently
divined
rowland
s
mute
imaginings
for
he
presently
stepped
forward
with
a
bow
like
a
master
of
ceremonies
i
have
not
done
my
duty
he
said
in
not
announcing
these
ladies
light
miss
light
rowland
was
not
materially
the
wiser
for
this
information
but
roderick
was
aroused
by
it
to
the
exercise
of
some
slight
hospitality
he
altered
the
light
pulled
forward
two
or
three
figures
and
made
an
apology
for
not
having
more
to
show
i
don
t
pretend
to
have
anything
of
an
exhibition
i
am
only
a
indeed
a
novice
for
a
novice
this
is
very
well
light
declared
cavaliere
we
have
seen
nothing
better
than
the
cavaliere
smiled
rapturously
it
is
stupendous
he
murmured
and
we
have
been
to
all
the
not
to
all
heaven
forbid
cried
light
but
to
a
number
that
i
have
had
pointed
out
by
artistic
friends
i
delight
in
studios
they
are
the
temples
of
the
beautiful
here
below
and
if
you
are
a
novice
hudson
she
went
on
you
have
already
great
admirers
half
a
dozen
people
have
told
us
that
yours
were
among
the
things
to
this
gracious
speech
went
unanswered
roderick
had
already
wandered
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
studio
and
was
revolving
about
miss
light
ah
he
s
gone
to
look
at
my
beautiful
daughter
he
is
not
the
first
that
has
had
his
head
turned
light
resumed
lowering
her
voice
to
a
confidential
undertone
a
favor
which
considering
the
shortness
of
their
acquaintance
rowland
was
bound
to
appreciate
the
artists
are
all
crazy
about
her
when
she
goes
into
a
studio
she
is
fatal
to
the
pictures
and
when
she
goes
into
a
what
do
the
other
women
say
eh
cavaliere
she
is
very
beautiful
rowland
said
gravely
light
who
through
her
long
glass
was
looking
a
little
at
everything
and
at
nothing
as
if
she
saw
it
interrupted
her
random
murmurs
and
exclamations
and
surveyed
rowland
from
head
to
foot
she
looked
at
him
all
over
apparently
he
had
not
been
mentioned
to
her
as
a
feature
of
roderick
s
establishment
it
was
the
gaze
rowland
felt
which
the
vigilant
and
ambitious
mamma
of
a
beautiful
daughter
has
always
at
her
command
for
young
men
of
candid
physiognomy
her
inspection
in
this
case
seemed
satisfactory
are
you
also
an
artist
she
inquired
with
an
almost
caressing
inflection
it
was
clear
that
what
she
meant
was
something
of
this
kind
be
so
good
as
to
assure
me
without
delay
that
you
are
really
the
young
man
of
substance
and
amiability
that
you
but
rowland
answered
simply
the
formal
question
not
the
latent
one
dear
me
no
i
am
only
a
friend
of
light
with
a
sigh
returned
to
the
statues
and
after
mistaking
the
adam
for
a
gladiator
and
the
eve
for
a
pocahontas
declared
that
she
could
not
judge
of
such
things
unless
she
saw
them
in
the
marble
rowland
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
speaking
in
the
interest
of
roderick
s
renown
said
that
he
was
the
happy
possessor
of
several
of
his
friend
s
works
and
that
she
was
welcome
to
come
and
see
them
at
his
rooms
she
bade
the
cavaliere
make
a
note
of
his
address
ah
you
re
a
patron
of
the
arts
she
said
that
s
what
i
should
like
to
be
if
i
had
a
little
money
i
delight
in
beauty
in
every
form
but
all
these
people
ask
such
monstrous
prices
one
must
be
a
millionaire
to
think
of
such
things
eh
twenty
years
ago
my
husband
had
my
portrait
painted
here
in
rome
by
papucci
who
was
the
great
man
in
those
days
i
was
in
a
ball
dress
with
all
my
jewels
my
neck
and
arms
and
all
that
the
man
got
six
hundred
francs
and
thought
he
was
very
well
treated
those
were
the
days
when
a
family
could
live
like
princes
in
italy
for
five
thousand
scudi
a
year
the
cavaliere
once
upon
a
time
was
a
great
dandy
don
t
blush
cavaliere
any
one
can
see
that
just
as
any
one
can
see
that
i
was
once
a
pretty
woman
get
him
to
tell
you
what
he
made
a
figure
upon
the
railroads
have
brought
in
the
vulgarians
that
s
what
i
call
it
now
the
invasion
of
the
vulgarians
what
are
poor
we
to
do
rowland
had
begun
to
murmur
some
remedial
proposition
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
miss
light
calling
across
the
room
mamma
my
own
love
this
gentleman
wishes
to
model
my
bust
please
speak
to
the
cavaliere
gave
a
little
chuckle
already
he
cried
rowland
looked
round
equally
surprised
at
the
promptitude
of
the
proposal
roderick
stood
planted
before
the
young
girl
with
his
arms
folded
looking
at
her
as
he
would
have
done
at
the
medicean
venus
he
never
paid
compliments
and
rowland
though
he
had
not
heard
him
speak
could
imagine
the
startling
distinctness
with
which
he
made
his
request
he
saw
me
a
year
ago
the
young
girl
went
on
and
he
has
been
thinking
of
me
ever
her
tone
in
speaking
was
peculiar
it
had
a
kind
of
studied
inexpressiveness
which
was
yet
not
the
vulgar
device
of
a
drawl
i
must
make
your
daughter
s
bust
that
s
all
madame
cried
roderick
with
warmth
i
had
rather
you
made
the
poodle
s
said
the
young
girl
is
it
very
tiresome
i
have
spent
half
my
life
sitting
for
my
photograph
in
every
conceivable
attitude
and
with
every
conceivable
coiffure
i
think
i
have
posed
my
dear
child
said
light
it
may
be
one
s
duty
to
pose
but
as
to
my
daughter
s
sitting
to
you
sir
to
a
young
sculptor
whom
we
don
t
know
it
is
a
matter
that
needs
reflection
it
is
not
a
favor
that
s
to
be
had
for
the
mere
if
i
don
t
make
her
from
life
said
roderick
with
energy
i
will
make
her
from
memory
and
if
the
thing
s
to
be
done
you
had
better
have
it
done
as
well
as
mamma
hesitates
said
miss
light
because
she
does
n
t
know
whether
you
mean
she
shall
pay
you
for
the
bust
i
can
assure
you
that
she
will
not
pay
you
a
my
darling
you
forget
yourself
said
light
with
an
attempt
at
majestic
severity
of
course
she
added
in
a
moment
with
a
change
of
note
the
bust
would
be
my
own
of
course
cried
roderick
impatiently
dearest
mother
interposed
the
young
girl
how
can
you
carry
a
marble
bust
about
the
world
with
you
is
it
not
enough
to
drag
the
poor
original
my
dear
you
re
nonsensical
cried
light
almost
angrily
you
can
always
sell
it
said
the
young
girl
with
the
same
artful
artlessness
light
turned
to
rowland
who
pitied
her
flushed
and
irritated
she
is
very
wicked
the
cavaliere
grinned
in
silence
and
walked
away
on
tiptoe
with
his
hat
to
his
lips
as
if
to
leave
the
field
clear
for
action
rowland
on
the
contrary
wished
to
avert
the
coming
storm
you
had
better
not
refuse
he
said
to
miss
light
until
you
have
seen
hudson
s
things
in
the
marble
your
mother
is
to
come
and
look
at
some
that
i
thank
you
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
see
us
i
dare
say
hudson
is
very
clever
but
i
don
t
care
for
modern
sculpture
i
can
t
look
at
it
you
shall
care
for
my
bust
i
promise
you
cried
roderick
with
a
laugh
to
satisfy
miss
light
said
the
cavaliere
one
of
the
old
greeks
ought
to
come
to
it
would
be
worth
his
while
said
roderick
paying
to
rowland
s
knowledge
his
first
compliment
i
might
sit
to
phidias
if
he
would
promise
to
be
very
amusing
and
make
me
laugh
what
do
you
say
stenterello
would
you
sit
to
phidias
we
must
talk
of
this
some
other
time
said
light
we
are
in
rome
for
the
winter
many
thanks
cavaliere
call
the
the
cavaliere
led
the
way
out
backing
like
a
and
miss
light
following
her
mother
nodded
without
looking
at
them
to
each
of
the
young
men
immortal
powers
what
a
head
cried
roderick
when
they
had
gone
there
s
my
fortune
she
is
certainly
very
beautiful
said
rowland
but
i
m
sorry
you
have
undertaken
her
and
why
pray
i
suspect
it
will
bring
trouble
with
what
kind
of
trouble
i
hardly
know
they
are
queer
people
the
mamma
i
suspect
is
the
least
bit
of
an
adventuress
heaven
knows
what
the
daughter
she
s
a
goddess
cried
roderick
just
so
she
is
all
the
more
dangerous
what
will
she
do
to
me
she
does
n
t
bite
i
it
remains
to
be
seen
there
are
two
kinds
of
women
you
ought
to
know
it
by
this
time
the
safe
and
the
unsafe
miss
light
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
one
of
the
unsafe
a
word
to
the
wise
much
obliged
said
roderick
and
he
began
to
whistle
a
triumphant
air
in
honor
apparently
of
the
advent
of
his
beautiful
model
in
calling
this
young
lady
and
her
mamma
queer
people
rowland
but
roughly
expressed
his
sentiment
they
were
so
marked
a
variation
from
the
monotonous
troop
of
his
people
that
he
felt
much
curiosity
as
to
the
sources
of
the
change
especially
since
he
doubted
greatly
whether
on
the
whole
it
elevated
the
type
for
a
week
he
saw
the
two
ladies
driving
daily
in
a
landau
with
the
cavaliere
and
the
poodle
in
the
front
seat
from
light
he
received
a
gracious
salute
tempered
by
her
native
majesty
but
the
young
girl
looking
straight
before
her
seemed
profoundly
indifferent
to
observers
her
extraordinary
beauty
however
had
already
made
observers
numerous
and
given
the
habitues
of
the
pincian
plenty
to
talk
about
the
echoes
of
their
commentary
reached
rowland
s
ears
but
he
had
little
taste
for
random
gossip
and
desired
a
distinctly
veracious
informant
he
had
found
one
in
the
person
of
madame
grandoni
for
whom
light
and
her
beautiful
daughter
were
a
pair
of
old
friends
i
have
known
the
mamma
for
twenty
years
said
this
judicious
critic
and
if
you
ask
any
of
the
people
who
have
been
living
here
as
long
as
i
you
will
find
they
remember
her
well
i
have
held
the
beautiful
christina
on
my
knee
when
she
was
a
little
wizened
baby
with
a
very
red
face
and
no
promise
of
beauty
but
those
magnificent
eyes
ten
years
ago
light
disappeared
and
has
not
since
been
seen
in
rome
except
for
a
few
days
last
winter
when
she
passed
through
on
her
way
to
naples
then
it
was
you
met
the
trio
in
the
ludovisi
gardens
when
i
first
knew
her
she
was
the
unmarried
but
very
marriageable
daughter
of
an
old
american
painter
of
very
bad
landscapes
which
people
used
to
buy
from
charity
and
use
for
his
name
was
savage
it
used
to
make
every
one
laugh
he
was
such
a
mild
melancholy
pitiful
old
gentleman
he
had
married
a
horrible
wife
an
englishwoman
who
had
been
on
the
stage
it
was
said
she
used
to
beat
poor
savage
with
his
and
when
the
domestic
finances
were
low
to
lock
him
up
in
his
studio
and
tell
him
he
should
n
t
come
out
until
he
had
painted
half
a
dozen
of
his
daubs
she
had
a
good
deal
of
showy
beauty
she
would
then
go
forth
and
her
beauty
helping
she
would
make
certain
people
take
the
pictures
it
helped
her
at
last
to
make
an
english
lord
run
away
with
her
at
the
time
i
speak
of
she
had
quite
disappeared
light
was
then
a
very
handsome
girl
though
by
no
means
so
handsome
as
her
daughter
has
now
become
light
was
an
american
consul
newly
appointed
at
one
of
the
adriatic
ports
he
was
a
mild
young
man
with
some
little
property
and
my
impression
is
that
he
had
got
into
bad
company
at
home
and
that
his
family
procured
him
his
place
to
keep
him
out
of
harm
s
way
he
came
up
to
rome
on
a
holiday
fell
in
love
with
miss
savage
and
married
her
on
the
spot
he
had
not
been
married
three
years
when
he
was
drowned
in
the
adriatic
no
one
ever
knew
how
the
young
widow
came
back
to
rome
to
her
father
and
here
shortly
afterwards
in
the
shadow
of
saint
peter
s
her
little
girl
was
born
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
light
would
marry
again
and
i
know
she
had
opportunities
but
she
overreached
herself
she
would
take
nothing
less
than
a
title
and
a
fortune
and
they
were
not
forthcoming
she
was
admired
and
very
fond
of
admiration
very
vain
very
worldly
very
silly
she
remained
a
pretty
widow
with
a
surprising
variety
of
bonnets
and
a
dozen
men
always
in
her
train
giacosa
dates
from
this
period
he
calls
himself
a
roman
but
i
have
an
impression
he
came
up
from
ancona
with
her
he
was
l
ami
de
la
maison
he
used
to
hold
her
bouquets
clean
her
gloves
i
was
told
run
her
errands
get
her
and
fight
her
battles
with
the
shopkeepers
for
this
he
needed
courage
for
she
was
smothered
in
debt
she
at
last
left
rome
to
escape
her
creditors
many
of
them
must
remember
her
still
but
she
seems
now
to
have
money
to
satisfy
them
she
left
her
poor
old
father
here
alone
helpless
infirm
and
unable
to
work
a
subscription
was
shortly
afterwards
taken
up
among
the
foreigners
and
he
was
sent
back
to
america
where
as
i
afterwards
heard
he
died
in
some
sort
of
asylum
from
time
to
time
for
several
years
i
heard
vaguely
of
light
as
a
wandering
beauty
at
french
and
german
once
came
a
rumor
that
she
was
going
to
make
a
grand
marriage
in
england
then
we
heard
that
the
gentleman
had
thought
better
of
it
and
left
her
to
keep
afloat
as
she
could
she
was
a
terribly
creature
she
pretends
to
be
a
great
lady
but
i
consider
that
old
filomena
my
is
in
essentials
a
greater
one
but
certainly
after
all
she
has
been
fortunate
she
embarked
at
last
on
a
lawsuit
about
some
property
with
her
husband
s
family
and
went
to
america
to
attend
to
it
she
came
back
triumphant
with
a
long
purse
she
reappeared
in
italy
and
established
herself
for
a
while
in
venice
then
she
came
to
florence
where
she
spent
a
couple
of
years
and
where
i
saw
her
last
year
she
passed
down
to
naples
which
i
should
have
said
was
just
the
place
for
her
and
this
winter
she
has
laid
siege
to
rome
she
seems
very
prosperous
she
has
taken
a
floor
in
the
palazzo
f
she
keeps
her
carriage
and
christina
and
she
between
them
must
have
a
pretty
milliner
s
bill
giacosa
has
turned
up
again
looking
as
if
he
had
been
kept
on
ice
at
ancona
for
her
what
sort
of
education
rowland
asked
do
you
imagine
the
mother
s
adventures
to
have
been
for
the
daughter
a
strange
school
but
light
told
me
in
florence
that
she
had
given
her
child
the
education
of
a
princess
in
other
words
i
suppose
she
speaks
three
or
four
languages
and
has
read
several
hundred
french
novels
christina
i
suspect
is
very
clever
when
i
saw
her
i
was
amazed
at
her
beauty
and
certainly
if
there
is
any
truth
in
faces
she
ought
to
have
the
soul
of
an
angel
perhaps
she
has
i
don
t
judge
her
she
s
an
extraordinary
young
person
she
has
been
told
twenty
times
a
day
by
her
mother
since
she
was
five
years
old
that
she
is
a
beauty
of
beauties
that
her
face
is
her
fortune
and
that
if
she
plays
her
cards
she
may
marry
a
duke
if
she
has
not
been
fatally
corrupted
she
is
a
very
superior
girl
my
own
impression
is
that
she
is
a
mixture
of
good
and
bad
of
ambition
and
indifference
light
having
failed
to
make
her
own
fortune
in
matrimony
has
transferred
her
hopes
to
her
daughter
and
nursed
them
till
they
have
become
a
kind
of
monomania
she
has
a
hobby
which
she
rides
in
secret
but
some
day
she
will
let
you
see
it
i
m
sure
that
if
you
go
in
some
evening
unannounced
you
will
find
her
scanning
the
in
her
cup
or
telling
her
daughter
s
fortune
with
a
greasy
pack
of
cards
preserved
for
the
purpose
she
promises
her
a
prince
a
reigning
prince
but
if
light
is
silly
she
is
shrewd
too
and
lest
considerations
of
state
should
deny
her
prince
the
luxury
of
a
she
keeps
on
hand
a
few
common
mortals
at
the
worst
she
would
take
a
duke
an
english
lord
or
even
a
young
american
with
a
proper
number
of
millions
the
poor
woman
must
be
rather
uncomfortable
she
is
always
building
castles
and
knocking
them
down
again
always
casting
her
nets
and
pulling
them
in
if
her
daughter
were
less
of
a
beauty
her
transparent
ambition
would
be
very
ridiculous
but
there
is
something
in
the
girl
as
one
looks
at
her
that
seems
to
make
it
very
possible
she
is
marked
out
for
one
of
those
wonderful
romantic
fortunes
that
history
now
and
then
relates
who
after
all
was
the
empress
of
the
french
light
is
forever
saying
and
beside
christina
the
empress
is
a
dowdy
and
what
does
christina
say
she
makes
no
scruple
as
you
know
of
saying
that
her
mother
is
a
fool
what
she
thinks
heaven
knows
i
suspect
that
practically
she
does
not
commit
herself
she
is
excessively
proud
and
thinks
herself
good
enough
to
occupy
the
highest
station
in
the
world
but
she
knows
that
her
mother
talks
nonsense
and
that
even
a
beautiful
girl
may
look
awkward
in
making
unsuccessful
advances
so
she
remains
superbly
indifferent
and
lets
her
mother
take
the
risks
if
the
prince
is
secured
so
much
the
better
if
he
is
not
she
need
never
confess
to
herself
that
even
a
prince
has
slighted
your
report
is
as
solid
rowland
said
to
madame
grandoni
thanking
her
as
if
it
had
been
prepared
for
the
academy
of
sciences
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
listened
to
it
when
a
couple
of
days
later
light
and
her
daughter
attended
by
the
cavaliere
and
the
poodle
came
to
his
rooms
to
look
at
roderick
s
statues
it
was
more
comfortable
to
know
just
with
whom
he
was
dealing
light
was
prodigiously
gracious
and
showered
down
compliments
not
only
on
the
statues
but
on
all
his
possessions
upon
my
word
she
said
you
men
know
how
to
make
yourselves
comfortable
if
one
of
us
poor
women
had
half
as
many
and
we
should
be
famously
abused
it
s
really
selfish
to
be
living
all
alone
in
such
a
place
as
this
cavaliere
how
should
you
like
this
suite
of
rooms
and
a
fortune
to
fill
them
with
pictures
and
statues
christina
love
look
at
that
mosaic
table
mallet
i
could
almost
beg
it
from
you
yes
that
eve
is
certainly
very
fine
we
need
n
t
be
ashamed
of
such
a
as
that
if
she
was
really
such
a
beautiful
woman
it
accounts
for
the
good
looks
of
some
of
us
where
is
what
the
young
sculptor
why
is
n
t
he
here
to
be
complimented
christina
had
remained
but
for
a
moment
in
the
chair
which
rowland
had
placed
for
her
had
given
but
a
cursory
glance
at
the
statues
and
then
leaving
her
place
had
begun
to
wander
round
the
room
looking
at
herself
in
the
mirror
touching
the
ornaments
and
curiosities
glancing
at
the
books
and
prints
rowland
s
was
encumbered
with
and
she
found
plenty
of
occupation
rowland
presently
joined
her
and
pointed
out
some
of
the
objects
he
most
valued
it
s
an
odd
jumble
she
said
frankly
some
things
are
very
pretty
some
are
very
ugly
but
i
like
ugly
things
when
they
have
a
certain
look
prettiness
is
terribly
vulgar
nowadays
and
it
is
not
every
one
that
knows
just
the
sort
of
ugliness
that
has
chic
but
chic
is
getting
dreadfully
common
too
there
s
a
hint
of
it
even
in
madame
baldi
s
bonnets
i
like
looking
at
people
s
things
she
added
in
a
moment
turning
to
rowland
and
resting
her
eyes
on
him
it
helps
you
to
find
out
their
am
i
to
suppose
asked
rowland
smiling
that
you
have
arrived
at
any
conclusions
as
to
mine
i
am
rather
muddled
you
have
too
many
things
one
seems
to
contradict
another
you
are
very
artistic
and
yet
you
are
very
prosaic
you
have
what
is
called
a
catholic
taste
and
yet
you
are
full
of
obstinate
little
prejudices
and
habits
of
thought
which
if
i
knew
you
i
should
find
very
tiresome
i
don
t
think
i
like
you
make
a
great
mistake
laughed
rowland
i
assure
you
i
am
very
yes
i
am
probably
wrong
and
if
i
knew
you
i
should
find
out
i
was
wrong
and
that
would
irritate
me
and
make
me
dislike
you
more
so
you
see
we
are
necessary
no
i
don
t
dislike
worse
and
worse
for
you
certainly
will
not
like
you
are
very
i
am
fond
of
facing
the
truth
though
some
day
you
will
deny
that
where
is
that
queer
friend
of
yours
you
mean
hudson
he
is
represented
by
these
beautiful
miss
light
looked
for
some
moments
at
roderick
s
statues
yes
she
said
they
are
not
so
silly
as
most
of
the
things
we
have
seen
they
have
no
chic
and
yet
they
are
you
describe
them
perfectly
said
rowland
they
are
beautiful
and
yet
they
have
no
chic
that
s
it
if
he
will
promise
to
put
none
into
my
bust
i
have
a
mind
to
let
him
make
it
a
request
made
in
those
terms
deserves
to
be
in
what
terms
did
n
t
you
hear
him
mademoiselle
you
almost
satisfy
my
conception
of
the
beautiful
i
must
model
your
that
almost
should
be
rewarded
he
is
like
me
he
likes
to
face
the
truth
i
think
we
should
get
on
the
cavaliere
approached
rowland
to
express
the
pleasure
he
had
derived
from
his
beautiful
his
smile
was
exquisitely
bland
his
accent
appealing
caressing
insinuating
but
he
gave
rowland
an
odd
sense
of
looking
at
a
little
waxen
image
adjusted
to
perform
certain
gestures
and
emit
certain
sounds
it
had
once
contained
a
soul
but
the
soul
had
leaked
out
nevertheless
rowland
reflected
there
are
more
profitless
things
than
mere
sound
and
gesture
in
a
consummate
italian
and
the
cavaliere
too
had
soul
enough
left
to
desire
to
speak
a
few
words
on
his
own
account
and
call
rowland
s
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
after
all
a
hired
cicerone
but
an
ancient
roman
gentleman
rowland
felt
sorry
for
him
he
hardly
knew
why
he
assured
him
in
a
friendly
fashion
that
he
must
come
again
that
his
house
was
always
at
his
service
the
cavaliere
bowed
down
to
the
ground
you
do
me
too
much
honor
he
murmured
if
you
will
allow
me
it
is
not
impossible
light
meanwhile
had
prepared
to
depart
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
come
and
see
two
quiet
little
women
we
shall
be
most
happy
she
said
we
have
no
statues
nor
pictures
we
have
nothing
but
each
other
eh
darling
i
beg
your
pardon
said
christina
oh
and
the
cavaliere
added
her
mother
the
poodle
please
cried
the
young
girl
rowland
glanced
at
the
cavaliere
he
was
smiling
more
blandly
than
ever
a
few
days
later
rowland
presented
himself
as
civility
demanded
at
light
s
door
he
found
her
living
in
one
of
the
stately
houses
of
the
via
dell
angelo
custode
and
rather
to
his
surprise
was
told
she
was
at
home
he
passed
through
half
a
dozen
rooms
and
was
ushered
into
an
immense
saloon
at
one
end
of
which
sat
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
with
a
piece
of
embroidery
she
received
him
very
graciously
and
then
pointing
mysteriously
to
a
large
screen
which
was
unfolded
across
the
embrasure
of
one
of
the
deep
windows
i
am
keeping
guard
she
said
rowland
looked
interrogative
whereupon
she
beckoned
him
forward
and
motioned
him
to
look
behind
the
screen
he
obeyed
and
for
some
moments
stood
gazing
roderick
with
his
back
turned
stood
before
an
extemporized
pedestal
ardently
shaping
a
formless
mass
of
clay
before
him
sat
christina
light
in
a
white
dress
with
her
shoulders
bare
her
magnificent
hair
twisted
into
a
classic
coil
and
her
head
admirably
poised
meeting
rowland
s
gaze
she
smiled
a
little
only
with
her
deep
gray
eyes
without
moving
she
looked
divinely
beautiful
chapter
christina
the
brilliant
roman
winter
came
round
again
and
rowland
enjoyed
it
in
a
certain
way
more
deeply
than
before
he
grew
at
last
to
feel
that
sense
of
equal
possession
of
intellectual
nearness
which
it
belongs
to
the
peculiar
magic
of
the
ancient
city
to
infuse
into
minds
of
a
cast
that
she
never
would
have
produced
he
became
passionately
unreasoningly
fond
of
all
roman
sights
and
sensations
and
to
breathe
the
roman
atmosphere
began
to
seem
a
needful
condition
of
being
he
could
not
have
defined
and
explained
the
nature
of
his
great
love
nor
have
made
up
the
sum
of
it
by
the
addition
of
his
calculable
pleasures
it
was
a
large
vague
idle
emotion
of
which
perhaps
the
most
pertinent
thing
that
may
be
said
is
that
it
enforced
a
sort
of
oppressive
reconciliation
to
the
present
the
actual
the
sensuous
to
life
on
the
terms
that
there
offered
themselves
it
was
perhaps
for
this
very
reason
that
in
spite
of
the
charm
which
rome
flings
over
one
s
mood
there
ran
through
rowland
s
meditations
an
undertone
of
melancholy
natural
enough
in
a
mind
which
finds
its
horizon
insidiously
limited
to
the
finite
even
in
very
picturesque
forms
whether
it
is
one
that
tacitly
concedes
to
the
roman
church
the
monopoly
of
a
guarantee
of
immortality
so
that
if
one
is
indisposed
to
bargain
with
her
for
the
precious
gift
one
must
do
without
it
altogether
or
whether
in
an
atmosphere
so
heavily
weighted
with
echoes
and
memories
one
grows
to
believe
that
there
is
nothing
in
one
s
consciousness
that
is
not
foredoomed
to
moulder
and
crumble
and
become
dust
for
the
feet
and
possible
malaria
for
the
lungs
of
future
generations
the
fact
at
least
remains
that
one
parts
with
one
s
hopes
in
rome
and
misses
them
only
under
some
very
exceptional
stress
of
circumstance
for
this
reason
one
may
perhaps
say
that
there
is
no
other
place
in
which
one
s
daily
temper
has
such
a
mellow
serenity
and
none
at
the
same
time
in
which
acute
attacks
of
depression
are
more
intolerable
rowland
found
in
fact
a
perfect
response
to
his
prevision
that
to
live
in
rome
was
an
education
to
one
s
senses
and
one
s
imagination
but
he
sometimes
wondered
whether
this
was
not
a
questionable
gain
in
case
of
one
s
not
being
prepared
to
live
wholly
by
one
s
imagination
and
one
s
senses
the
tranquil
profundity
of
his
daily
satisfaction
seemed
sometimes
to
turn
by
a
mysterious
inward
impulse
and
face
itself
with
questioning
admonishing
threatening
eyes
but
afterwards
it
seemed
to
ask
with
a
long
reverberation
and
he
could
give
no
answer
but
a
shy
affirmation
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
afterwards
and
a
hope
divided
against
itself
that
his
actual
way
of
life
would
last
forever
he
often
felt
he
was
sombre
without
knowing
why
there
were
no
visible
clouds
in
his
heaven
but
there
were
on
his
mood
shadows
projected
they
often
were
without
his
knowing
it
by
an
undue
apprehension
that
things
after
all
might
not
go
so
ideally
well
with
roderick
when
he
understood
his
anxiety
it
vexed
him
and
he
rebuked
himself
for
taking
things
unmanfully
hard
if
roderick
chose
to
follow
a
crooked
path
it
was
no
fault
of
his
he
had
given
him
he
would
continue
to
give
him
all
that
he
had
offered
him
friendship
sympathy
advice
he
had
not
undertaken
to
provide
him
with
unflagging
strength
of
purpose
nor
to
stand
bondsman
for
unqualified
success
if
rowland
felt
his
roots
striking
and
spreading
in
the
roman
soil
roderick
also
surrendered
himself
with
renewed
abandon
to
the
local
influence
more
than
once
he
declared
to
his
companion
that
he
meant
to
live
and
die
within
the
shadow
of
saint
peter
s
and
that
he
cared
little
if
he
never
again
drew
breath
in
american
air
for
a
man
of
my
temperament
rome
is
the
only
possible
place
he
said
it
s
better
to
recognize
the
fact
early
than
late
so
i
shall
never
go
home
unless
i
am
absolutely
what
is
your
idea
of
force
asked
rowland
smiling
it
seems
to
me
you
have
an
excellent
reason
for
going
home
some
day
or
ah
you
mean
my
engagement
roderick
answered
with
unaverted
eyes
yes
i
am
distinctly
engaged
in
northampton
and
impatiently
waited
for
and
he
gave
a
little
sympathetic
sigh
to
reconcile
northampton
and
rome
is
rather
a
problem
mary
had
better
come
out
here
even
at
the
worst
i
have
no
intention
of
giving
up
rome
within
six
or
eight
years
and
an
engagement
of
that
duration
would
be
rather
miss
garland
could
hardly
leave
your
mother
rowland
observed
oh
of
course
my
mother
should
come
i
think
i
will
suggest
it
in
my
next
letter
it
will
take
her
a
year
or
two
to
make
up
her
mind
to
it
but
if
she
consents
it
will
brighten
her
up
it
s
too
small
a
life
over
there
even
for
a
timid
old
lady
it
is
hard
to
imagine
he
added
any
change
in
mary
being
a
change
for
the
better
but
i
should
like
her
to
take
a
look
at
the
world
and
have
her
notions
stretched
a
little
one
is
never
so
good
i
suppose
but
that
one
can
improve
a
if
you
wish
your
mother
and
miss
garland
to
come
rowland
suggested
you
had
better
go
home
and
bring
oh
i
can
t
think
of
leaving
europe
for
many
a
day
roderick
answered
at
present
it
would
quite
break
the
charm
i
am
just
beginning
to
profit
to
get
used
to
things
and
take
them
naturally
i
am
sure
the
sight
of
northampton
main
street
would
permanently
upset
it
was
reassuring
to
hear
that
roderick
in
his
own
view
was
but
just
beginning
to
spread
his
wings
and
rowland
if
he
had
had
any
forebodings
might
have
suffered
them
to
be
modified
by
this
declaration
this
was
the
first
time
since
their
meeting
at
geneva
that
roderick
had
mentioned
miss
garland
s
name
but
the
ice
being
broken
he
indulged
for
some
time
afterward
in
frequent
allusions
to
his
betrothed
which
always
had
an
accent
of
scrupulous
of
almost
studied
consideration
an
uninitiated
observer
hearing
him
would
have
imagined
her
to
be
a
person
of
a
certain
age
possibly
an
affectionate
maiden
aunt
who
had
once
done
him
a
kindness
which
he
highly
appreciated
perhaps
presented
him
with
a
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
rowland
noted
the
difference
between
his
present
frankness
and
his
reticence
during
the
first
six
months
of
his
engagement
and
sometimes
wondered
whether
it
was
not
rather
an
anomaly
that
he
should
expatiate
more
largely
as
the
happy
event
receded
he
had
wondered
over
the
whole
matter
first
and
last
in
a
great
many
different
ways
and
looked
at
it
in
all
possible
lights
there
was
something
terribly
hard
to
explain
in
the
fact
of
his
having
fallen
in
love
with
his
cousin
she
was
not
as
rowland
conceived
her
the
sort
of
girl
he
would
have
been
likely
to
fancy
and
the
operation
of
sentiment
in
all
cases
so
mysterious
was
particularly
so
in
this
one
just
why
it
was
that
roderick
should
not
logically
have
fancied
miss
garland
his
companion
would
have
been
at
loss
to
say
but
i
think
the
conviction
had
its
roots
in
an
unformulated
comparison
between
himself
and
the
accepted
suitor
roderick
and
he
were
as
different
as
two
men
could
be
and
yet
roderick
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
for
whom
he
himself
had
been
keeping
in
reserve
for
years
a
profoundly
characteristic
passion
that
if
he
chose
to
conceive
a
great
notion
of
the
merits
of
roderick
s
mistress
the
irregularity
here
was
hardly
roderick
s
was
a
view
of
the
case
to
which
poor
rowland
did
scanty
justice
there
were
women
he
said
to
himself
whom
it
was
every
one
s
business
to
fall
in
love
with
a
little
women
beautiful
brilliant
artful
easily
fascinating
miss
light
for
instance
was
one
of
these
every
man
who
spoke
to
her
did
so
if
not
in
the
language
at
least
with
something
of
the
agitation
the
divine
tremor
of
a
lover
there
were
other
women
they
might
have
great
beauty
they
might
have
small
perhaps
they
were
generally
to
be
classified
as
plain
whose
triumphs
in
this
line
were
rare
but
immutably
permanent
such
a
one
preeminently
was
mary
garland
upon
the
doctrine
of
probabilities
it
was
unlikely
that
she
had
had
an
equal
charm
for
each
of
them
and
was
it
not
possible
therefore
that
the
charm
for
roderick
had
been
simply
the
charm
imagined
unquestioningly
accepted
the
general
charm
of
youth
sympathy
kindness
of
the
present
feminine
in
short
enhanced
indeed
by
several
fine
facial
traits
the
charm
in
this
case
for
rowland
was
the
charm
the
mysterious
individual
essential
woman
there
was
an
element
in
the
charm
as
his
companion
saw
it
which
rowland
was
obliged
to
recognize
but
which
he
forbore
to
ponder
the
rather
important
attraction
namely
of
reciprocity
as
to
miss
garland
being
in
love
with
roderick
and
becoming
charming
thereby
this
was
a
point
with
which
his
imagination
ventured
to
take
no
liberties
partly
because
it
would
have
been
indelicate
and
partly
because
it
would
have
been
vain
he
contented
himself
with
feeling
that
the
young
girl
was
still
as
vivid
an
image
in
his
memory
as
she
had
been
five
days
after
he
left
her
and
with
drifting
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
impression
that
at
just
that
crisis
any
other
girl
would
have
answered
roderick
s
sentimental
needs
as
well
any
other
girl
indeed
would
do
so
still
roderick
had
confessed
as
much
to
him
at
geneva
in
saying
that
he
had
been
taking
at
baden
the
measure
of
his
susceptibility
to
female
beauty
his
extraordinary
success
in
modeling
the
bust
of
the
beautiful
miss
light
was
pertinent
evidence
of
this
amiable
quality
she
sat
to
him
repeatedly
for
a
fortnight
and
the
work
was
rapidly
finished
on
one
of
the
last
days
roderick
asked
rowland
to
come
and
give
his
opinion
as
to
what
was
still
wanting
for
the
sittings
had
continued
to
take
place
in
light
s
apartment
the
studio
being
pronounced
too
damp
for
the
fair
model
when
rowland
presented
himself
christina
still
in
her
white
dress
with
her
shoulders
bare
was
standing
before
a
mirror
readjusting
her
hair
the
arrangement
of
which
on
this
occasion
had
apparently
not
met
the
young
sculptor
s
approval
he
stood
beside
her
directing
the
operation
with
a
peremptoriness
of
tone
which
seemed
to
rowland
to
denote
a
considerable
advance
in
intimacy
as
rowland
entered
christina
was
losing
patience
do
it
yourself
then
she
cried
and
with
a
rapid
movement
unloosed
the
great
coil
of
her
tresses
and
let
them
fall
over
her
shoulders
they
were
magnificent
and
with
her
perfect
face
dividing
their
rippling
flow
she
looked
like
some
immaculate
saint
of
legend
being
led
to
martyrdom
rowland
s
eyes
presumably
betrayed
his
admiration
but
her
own
manifested
no
consciousness
of
it
if
christina
was
a
coquette
as
the
remarkable
timeliness
of
this
incident
might
have
suggested
she
was
not
a
superficial
one
hudson

a
sculptor
said
rowland
with
warmth
but
if
i
were
only
a
painter
thank
heaven
you
are

christina
i
am
having
quite
enough
of
this
minute
inspection
of

young
man

coming
forward
and
seizing
her
daughter

christina
asked
i
beg
mallet
s
light
gathered
up
the
dusky
locks
and
let
them
fall
through
her
fingers
glancing
at
her
visitor
with
a
significant
smile
rowland
had
never
been
in
the
east
but
if
he
had
attempted
to
make
a
sketch
of
an
old
calling
attention
to
the
points
of
a
circassian
beauty
he
would
have
depicted
such
a
smile
as
light
s
mamma
s
not
really
shocked
added
christina
in
a
moment
as
if
she
had
guessed
her
mother
s
she
is
only
afraid
that
hudson
might
have
injured
my
hair
and
that
per
consequenza
i
should
sell

you

cried
mamma
you
deserve
that
i
should
make
a
fright
of
you
and
with
half
a
dozen
skillful
passes
she
twisted
the
tresses

picturesque
braid
placed
high
on
the
head
as

what

rowland
asked

of
the
young
girl

neck
i
do
her
justice
when
i
say
she
says
very
improper
things
what
is
one
to
do
with
such
a
thorn

the
flesh
light
demanded

of
it
at

leisure
mallet
said
christina
and
when
you
ve
discovered
something
let
us
hear
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
shall
not
willingly
believe
in
any
remedy
of
yours
for
you
have
something
in
your
physiognomy
that
particularly
provokes
me
to
make
the
remarks
that
my
mother
so
sincerely
deplores
i
noticed
it
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
think
it
s
because
your
face
is
so
broad
for
some
reason
or
other
broad
faces
exasperate
me
they
fill
me
with
a
kind
of
rabbia
last
summer
at
carlsbad
there
was
an
austrian
count
with
enormous
estates
and
some
great
office
at
court
he
was
very
attentive
seriously
so
he
was
really
very
far
gone
cela
ne
tenait
qu
a
moi
but
i
could
n
t
he
was
impossible
he
must
have
measured
from
ear
to
ear
at
least
a
yard
and
a
half
and
he
was
blond
too
which
made
it
worse
as
blond
as
stenterello
pure
fleece
so
i
said
to
him
frankly
many
thanks
herr
graf
your
uniform
is
magnificent
but
your
face
is
too
i
am
afraid
that
mine
also
said
rowland
with
a
smile
seems
just
now
to
have
assumed
an
unpardonable
oh
i
take
it
you
know
very
well
that
we
are
looking
for
a
husband
and
that
none
but
tremendous
swells
need
apply
surely
before
these
gentlemen
mamma
i
may
speak
freely
they
are
disinterested
mallet
won
t
do
because
though
he
s
rich
he
s
not
rich
enough
mamma
made
that
discovery
the
day
after
we
went
to
see
you
moved
to
it
by
the
promising
look
of
your
furniture
i
hope
she
was
right
eh
unless
you
have
millions
you
know
you
have
no
i
feel
like
a
beggar
said
rowland
oh
some
better
girl
than
i
will
decide
some
day
after
mature
reflection
that
on
the
whole
you
have
enough
hudson
of
course
is
nowhere
he
has
nothing
but
his
genius
and
his
beaux
roderick
had
stood
looking
at
christina
intently
while
she
delivered
herself
softly
and
slowly
of
this
surprising
nonsense
when
she
had
finished
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
their
eyes
met
and
he
blushed
a
little
let
me
model
you
and
he
who
can
may
marry
you
he
said
abruptly
light
while
her
daughter
talked
had
been
adding
a
few
touches
to
her
coiffure
she
is
not
so
silly
as
you
might
suppose
she
said
to
rowland
with
dignity
if
you
will
give
me
your
arm
we
will
go
and
look
at
the
does
that
represent
a
silly
girl
christina
demanded
when
they
stood
before
it
rowland
transferred
his
glance
several
times
from
the
portrait
to
the
original
it
represents
a
young
lady
he
said
whom
i
should
not
pretend
to
judge
she
may
be
a
fool
but
you
are
not
sure
many
thanks
you
have
seen
me
half
a
dozen
times
you
are
either
very
slow
or
i
am
very
i
am
certainly
slow
said
rowland
i
don
t
expect
to
make
up
my
mind
about
you
within
six
i
give
you
six
months
if
you
will
promise
then
a
perfectly
frank
opinion
mind
i
shall
not
forget
i
shall
insist
upon
well
though
i
am
slow
i
am
tolerably
brave
said
rowland
we
shall
christina
looked
at
the
bust
with
a
sigh
i
am
afraid
after
all
she
said
that
there
s
very
little
wisdom
in
it
save
what
the
artist
has
put
there
hudson
looked
particularly
wise
while
he
was
working
he
scowled
and
growled
but
he
never
opened
his
mouth
it
is
very
kind
of
him
not
to
have
represented
me
if
i
had
talked
a
lot
of
stuff
to
you
said
roderick
roundly
the
thing
would
not
have
been
a
tenth
so
is
it
good
after
all
mallet
is
a
famous
connoisseur
has
he
not
come
here
to
pronounce
the
bust
was
in
fact
a
very
happy
performance
and
roderick
had
risen
to
the
level
of
his
subject
it
was
thoroughly
a
portrait
and
not
a
vague
fantasy
executed
on
a
graceful
theme
as
the
busts
of
pretty
women
in
modern
sculpture
are
apt
to
be
the
resemblance
was
deep
and
vivid
there
was
extreme
fidelity
of
detail
and
yet
a
noble
simplicity
one
could
say
of
the
head
that
without
idealization
it
was
a
representation
of
ideal
beauty
rowland
however
as
we
know
was
not
fond
of
exploding
into
superlatives
and
after
examining
the
piece
contented
himself
with
suggesting
two
or
three
alterations
of
detail
nay
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
demanded
light
with
soft
reproachfulness
it
is
surely
a
wonderful
thing
rowland
knows
it
s
a
wonderful
thing
said
roderick
smiling
i
can
tell
that
by
his
face
the
other
day
i
finished
something
he
thought
bad
and
he
looked
very
differently
from
how
did
mallet
look
asked
christina
my
dear
rowland
said
roderick
i
am
speaking
of
my
seated
woman
you
looked
as
if
you
had
on
a
pair
of
tight
ah
my
child
you
ll
not
understand
that
cried
light
you
never
yet
had
a
pair
that
were
small
it
s
a
pity
hudson
said
christina
gravely
that
you
could
not
have
introduced
my
feet
into
the
bust
but
we
can
hang
a
pair
of
slippers
round
the
neck
i
nevertheless
like
your
statues
roderick
rowland
rejoined
better
than
your
jokes
this
is
admirable
miss
light
you
may
be
proud
thank
you
mallet
for
the
permission
rejoined
the
young
girl
i
am
dying
to
see
it
in
the
marble
with
a
red
velvet
screen
behind
it
said
light
placed
there
under
the
sassoferrato
christina
went
on
i
hope
you
keep
well
in
mind
hudson
that
you
have
not
a
grain
of
property
in
your
work
and
that
if
mamma
chooses
she
may
have
it
photographed
and
the
copies
sold
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
at
five
francs
apiece
without
your
having
a
sou
of
the
amen
said
roderick
it
was
so
nominated
in
the
bond
my
profits
are
here
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
it
would
be
prettier
if
you
said
here
and
christina
touched
her
heart
my
precious
child
how
you
do
run
on
murmured
light
it
is
mallet
the
young
girl
answered
i
can
t
talk
a
word
of
sense
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
room
i
don
t
say
that
to
make
you
go
she
added
i
say
it
simply
to
justify
rowland
bowed
in
silence
roderick
declared
that
he
must
get
at
work
and
requested
christina
to
take
her
usual
position
and
light
proposed
to
her
visitor
that
they
should
adjourn
to
her
boudoir
this
was
a
small
room
hardly
more
spacious
than
an
alcove
opening
out
of
the
and
having
no
other
issue
here
as
they
entered
on
a
divan
near
the
door
rowland
perceived
the
cavaliere
giacosa
with
his
arms
folded
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
and
his
eyes
closed
sleeping
at
his
post
said
rowland
with
a
kindly
laugh
that
s
a
punishable
offense
rejoined
light
sharply
she
was
on
the
point
of
calling
him
in
the
same
tone
when
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
stared
a
moment
and
then
rose
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
excuse
me
dear
lady
he
said
i
was
overcome
by
the
the
great
nonsense
cavaliere
cried
the
lady
you
know
we
are
perishing
here
with
the
cold
you
had
better
go
and
cool
yourself
in
one
of
the
other
i
obey
dear
lady
said
the
cavaliere
and
with
another
smile
and
bow
to
rowland
he
departed
walking
very
discreetly
on
his
toes
rowland
him
but
a
short
time
for
he
was
not
fond
of
light
and
he
found
nothing
very
inspiring
in
her
frank
intimation
that
if
he
chose
he
might
become
a
favorite
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
for
pleasing
her
he
confounded
his
fatal
urbanity
in
the
of
the
palace
he
overtook
the
cavaliere
who
had
stopped
at
the
porter
s
lodge
to
say
a
word
to
his
little
girl
she
was
a
young
lady
of
very
tender
years
and
she
wore
a
very
dirty
pinafore
he
had
taken
her
up
in
his
arms
and
was
singing
an
infantine
rhyme
to
her
and
she
was
staring
at
him
with
big
soft
roman
eyes
on
seeing
rowland
he
put
her
down
with
a
kiss
and
stepped
forward
with
a
conscious
grin
an
unresentful
admission
that
he
was
sensitive
both
to
chubbiness
and
ridicule
rowland
began
to
pity
him
again
he
had
taken
his
dismissal
from
the
so
meekly
you
don
t
keep
your
promise
said
rowland
to
come
and
see
me
don
t
forget
it
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
rome
thirty
years
thirty
years
ago
ah
dear
sir
rome
is
rome
still
a
place
where
strange
things
happen
but
happy
things
too
since
i
have
your
renewed
permission
to
call
you
do
me
too
much
honor
is
it
in
the
morning
or
in
the
evening
that
i
should
least
intrude
take
your
own
time
cavaliere
only
come
sometime
i
depend
upon
you
said
rowland
the
cavaliere
thanked
him
with
an
humble
obeisance
to
the
cavaliere
too
he
felt
that
he
was
in
roman
phrase
sympathetic
but
the
idea
of
pleasing
this
extremely
reduced
gentleman
was
not
disagreeable
to
him
miss
light
s
bust
stood
for
a
while
on
exhibition
in
roderick
s
studio
and
half
the
foreign
colony
came
to
see
it
with
the
completion
of
his
work
however
roderick
s
visits
at
the
palazzo
f
by
no
means
came
to
an
end
he
spent
half
his
time
in
light
s
and
began
to
be
talked
about
as
attentive
to
christina
the
success
of
the
bust
restored
his
equanimity
and
in
the
garrulity
of
his
he
suffered
rowland
to
see
that
she
was
just
now
the
object
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
rowland
when
they
talked
of
her
was
rather
listener
than
speaker
partly
because
roderick
s
own
tone
was
so
resonant
and
exultant
and
partly
because
when
his
companion
laughed
at
him
for
having
called
her
unsafe
he
was
too
perplexed
to
defend
himself
the
impression
remained
that
she
was
unsafe
that
she
was
a
complex
willful
passionate
creature
who
might
easily
engulf
a
too
confiding
spirit
in
the
eddies
of
her
capricious
temper
and
yet
he
strongly
felt
her
charm
the
eddies
had
a
strange
fascination
roderick
in
the
glow
of
that
renewed
admiration
provoked
by
the
fixed
attention
of
portrayal
was
never
weary
of
descanting
on
the
extraordinary
perfection
of
her
beauty
i
had
no
idea
of
it
he
said
till
i
began
to
look
at
her
with
an
eye
to
reproducing
line
for
line
and
curve
for
curve
her
face
is
the
most
exquisite
piece
of
modeling
that
ever
came
from
creative
hands
not
a
line
without
meaning
not
a
hair
s
breadth
that
is
not
admirably
finished
and
then
her
mouth
it
s
as
if
a
pair
of
lips
had
been
shaped
to
utter
pure
truth
without
doing
it
dishonor
later
after
he
had
been
working
for
a
week
he
declared
if
miss
light
were
inordinately
plain
she
would
still
be
the
most
fascinating
of
women
i
ve
quite
forgotten
her
beauty
he
said
or
rather
i
have
ceased
to
perceive
it
as
something
distinct
and
defined
something
independent
of
the
rest
of
her
she
is
all
one
and
all
consummately
interesting
what
does
she
do
what
does
she
say
that
is
so
remarkable
rowland
had
asked
say
sometimes
nothing
sometimes
everything
she
is
never
the
same
sometimes
she
walks
in
and
takes
her
place
without
a
word
without
a
smile
gravely
stiffly
as
if
it
were
an
awful
bore
she
hardly
looks
at
me
and
she
walks
away
without
even
glancing
at
my
work
on
other
days
she
laughs
and
chatters
and
asks
endless
questions
and
pours
out
the
most
irresistible
nonsense
she
is
a
creature
of
moods
you
can
t
count
upon
her
she
keeps
observation
on
the
stretch
and
then
bless
you
she
has
seen
such
a
lot
her
talk
is
full
of
the
oddest
allusions
it
is
altogether
a
very
singular
type
of
young
lady
said
rowland
after
the
visit
which
i
have
related
at
length
it
may
be
a
charm
but
it
is
certainly
not
the
orthodox
charm
of
marriageable
maidenhood
the
charm
of
shrinking
innocence
and
soft
docility
our
american
girls
are
accused
of
being
more
knowing
than
any
others
and
miss
light
is
nominally
an
american
but
it
has
taken
twenty
years
of
europe
to
make
her
what
she
is
the
first
time
we
saw
her
i
remember
you
called
her
a
product
of
the
old
world
and
certainly
you
were
not
far
ah
she
has
an
atmosphere
said
roderick
in
the
tone
of
high
appreciation
young
unmarried
women
rowland
answered
should
be
careful
not
to
have
too
much
ah
you
don
t
forgive
her
cried
his
companion
for
hitting
you
so
hard
a
man
ought
to
be
flattered
at
such
a
girl
as
that
taking
so
much
notice
of
a
man
is
never
flattered
at
a
woman
s
not
liking
are
you
sure
she
does
n
t
like
you
that
s
to
the
credit
of
your
humility
a
fellow
of
more
vanity
might
on
the
evidence
persuade
himself
that
he
was
in
he
would
have
also
said
rowland
laughing
to
be
a
fellow
of
remarkable
ingenuity
he
asked
himself
privately
how
the
deuce
roderick
reconciled
it
to
his
conscience
to
think
so
much
more
of
the
girl
he
was
not
engaged
to
than
of
the
girl
he
was
but
it
amounted
almost
to
arrogance
you
may
say
in
poor
rowland
to
pretend
to
know
how
often
roderick
thought
of
miss
garland
he
wondered
gloomily
at
any
rate
whether
for
men
of
his
companion
s
large
easy
power
there
was
not
a
larger
moral
law
than
for
narrow
mediocrities
like
himself
who
yielding
nature
a
meagre
interest
on
her
investment
such
as
it
was
had
no
reason
to
expect
from
her
this
affectionate
laxity
as
to
their
accounts
was
it
not
a
part
of
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
that
roderick
while
rhapsodizing
about
miss
light
should
have
it
at
his
command
to
look
at
you
with
eyes
of
the
most
guileless
and
unclouded
blue
and
to
shake
off
your
musty
imputations
by
a
toss
of
his
picturesque
brown
locks
or
had
he
in
fact
no
conscience
to
speak
of
happy
fellow
either
way
our
friend
gloriani
came
among
others
to
congratulate
roderick
on
his
model
and
what
he
had
made
of
her
devilish
pretty
through
and
through
he
said
as
he
looked
at
the
bust
capital
handling
of
the
neck
and
throat
lovely
work
on
the
nose
you
re
a
detestably
lucky
fellow
my
boy
but
you
ought
not
to
have
squandered
such
material
on
a
simple
bust
you
should
have
made
a
great
imaginative
figure
if
i
could
only
have
got
hold
of
her
i
would
have
put
her
into
a
statue
in
spite
of
herself
what
a
pity
she
is
not
a
ragged
trasteverine
whom
we
might
have
for
a
franc
an
hour
i
have
been
carrying
about
in
my
head
for
years
a
delicious
design
for
a
fantastic
figure
but
it
has
always
stayed
there
for
want
of
a
tolerable
model
i
have
seen
intimations
of
the
type
but
miss
light
is
the
perfection
of
it
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
said
to
myself
by
jove
there
s
my
statue
in
the
flesh
what
is
your
subject
asked
roderick
don
t
take
it
ill
said
gloriani
you
know
i
m
the
very
deuce
for
observation
she
would
make
a
magnificent
herodias
if
roderick
had
taken
it
ill
which
was
unlikely
for
we
know
he
thought
gloriani
an
ass
and
expected
little
of
his
wisdom
he
might
have
been
soothed
by
the
candid
incense
of
sam
singleton
who
came
and
sat
for
an
hour
in
a
sort
of
mental
prostration
before
both
bust
and
artist
but
roderick
s
attitude
before
his
patient
little
devotee
was
one
of
undisguised
though
friendly
amusement
and
indeed
judged
from
a
strictly
plastic
point
of
view
the
poor
fellow
s
diminutive
stature
his
enormous
mouth
his
pimples
and
his
yellow
hair
were
sufficiently
ridiculous
nay
don
t
envy
our
friend
rowland
said
to
singleton
afterwards
on
his
expressing
with
a
little
groan
of
depreciation
of
his
own
paltry
performances
his
sense
of
the
brilliancy
of
roderick
s
talent
you
sail
nearer
the
shore
but
you
sail
in
smoother
waters
be
contented
with
what
you
are
and
paint
me
another
oh
i
don
t
envy
hudson
anything
he
possesses
singleton
said
because
to
take
anything
away
would
spoil
his
beautiful
completeness
complete
that
s
what
he
is
while
we
little
clevernesses
are
like
plums
only
good
eating
on
the
side
that
has
had
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
nature
has
made
him
so
and
fortune
confesses
to
it
he
is
the
handsomest
fellow
in
rome
he
has
the
most
genius
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
comes
and
offers
to
be
his
model
if
that
is
not
completeness
where
shall
we
find
it
one
morning
going
into
roderick
s
studio
rowland
found
the
young
sculptor
entertaining
miss
blanchard
if
this
is
not
too
flattering
a
description
of
his
gracefully
passive
tolerance
of
her
presence
he
had
never
liked
her
and
never
climbed
into
her
to
observe
her
wonderful
manipulation
of
petals
he
had
once
quoted
tennyson
against
her
and
is
there
any
moral
shut
within
the
bosom
of
the
rose
in
all
miss
blanchard
s
roses
you
may
be
sure
there
is
a
moral
he
had
said
you
can
see
it
sticking
out
its
head
and
if
you
go
to
smell
the
flower
it
scratches
your
but
on
this
occasion
she
had
come
with
a
propitiatory
gift
introducing
her
friend
leavenworth
leavenworth
was
a
tall
expansive
bland
gentleman
with
a
carefully
brushed
whisker
and
a
spacious
fair
face
which
seemed
somehow
to
have
more
room
in
it
than
was
occupied
by
a
smile
of
superior
benevolence
so
that
with
his
smooth
white
forehead
it
bore
a
certain
resemblance
to
a
large
parlor
with
a
very
florid
carpet
but
no
pictures
on
the
walls
he
held
his
head
high
talked
sonorously
and
told
roderick
within
five
minutes
that
he
was
a
widower
traveling
to
distract
his
mind
and
that
he
had
lately
retired
from
the
proprietorship
of
large
mines
of
borax
in
pennsylvania
roderick
supposed
at
first
that
in
his
character
of
depressed
widower
he
had
come
to
order
a
tombstone
but
observing
then
the
extreme
blandness
of
his
address
to
miss
blanchard
he
credited
him
with
a
judicious
prevision
that
by
the
time
the
tombstone
was
completed
a
monument
of
his
inconsolability
might
have
become
an
anachronism
but
leavenworth
was
disposed
to
order
something
you
will
find
me
eager
to
patronize
our
indigenous
talent
he
said
i
am
putting
up
a
little
shanty
in
my
native
town
and
i
propose
to
make
a
rather
nice
thing
of
it
it
has
been
the
will
of
heaven
to
plunge
me
into
mourning
but
art
has
consolations
in
a
tasteful
home
surrounded
by
the
memorials
of
my
wanderings
i
hope
to
take
more
cheerful
views
i
ordered
in
paris
the
complete
appurtenances
of
a
do
you
think
you
could
do
something
for
my
library
it
is
to
be
filled
with
authors
and
i
think
a
pure
white
image
in
this
style
pointing
to
one
of
roderick
s
statues
standing
out
against
the
morocco
and
gilt
would
have
a
noble
effect
the
subject
i
have
already
fixed
upon
i
desire
an
allegorical
representation
of
culture
do
you
think
now
asked
leavenworth
encouragingly
you
could
rise
to
the
conception
a
most
interesting
subject
for
a
truly
serious
mind
remarked
miss
blanchard
roderick
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
the
simplest
thing
i
could
do
he
said
would
be
to
make
a
portrait
of
miss
blanchard
i
could
give
her
a
scroll
in
her
hand
and
that
would
do
for
the
miss
blanchard
colored
the
compliment
might
be
ironical
and
there
was
ever
afterwards
a
reflection
of
her
uncertainty
in
her
opinion
of
roderick
s
genius
leavenworth
responded
that
with
all
deference
to
miss
blanchard
s
beauty
he
desired
something
colder
more
monumental
more
impersonal
if
i
were
to
be
the
happy
possessor
of
a
likeness
of
miss
blanchard
he
added
i
should
prefer
to
have
it
in
no
factitious
disguise
roderick
consented
to
entertain
the
proposal
and
while
they
were
discussing
it
rowland
had
a
little
talk
with
the
fair
artist
who
is
your
friend
he
asked
a
very
worthy
man
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
which
is
magnificent
one
of
nature
s
gentlemen
this
was
a
trifle
sententious
and
rowland
turned
to
the
bust
of
miss
light
like
every
one
else
in
rome
by
this
time
miss
blanchard
had
an
opinion
on
the
young
girl
s
beauty
and
in
her
own
fashion
she
expressed
it
epigrammatically
she
looks
half
like
a
madonna
and
half
like
a
ballerina
she
said
leavenworth
and
roderick
came
to
an
understanding
and
the
young
sculptor
promised
to
do
his
best
to
rise
to
his
patron
s
conception
his
conception
be
hanged
roderick
exclaimed
after
he
had
departed
his
conception
is
sitting
on
a
globe
with
a
pen
in
her
ear
and
a
photographic
album
in
her
hand
i
shall
have
to
conceive
myself
for
the
money
i
ought
to
be
able
to
light
meanwhile
had
fairly
established
herself
in
roman
society
heaven
knows
how
madame
grandoni
said
to
rowland
who
had
mentioned
to
her
several
evidences
of
the
lady
s
prosperity
in
such
a
case
there
is
nothing
like
audacity
a
month
ago
she
knew
no
one
but
her
washerwoman
and
now
i
am
told
that
the
cards
of
roman
princesses
are
to
be
seen
on
her
table
she
is
evidently
determined
to
play
a
great
part
and
she
has
the
wit
to
perceive
that
to
make
remunerative
acquaintances
you
must
seem
yourself
to
be
worth
knowing
you
must
have
striking
rooms
and
a
confusing
variety
of
dresses
and
give
good
dinners
and
so
forth
she
is
spending
a
lot
of
money
and
you
ll
see
that
in
two
or
three
weeks
she
will
take
upon
herself
to
open
the
season
by
giving
a
magnificent
ball
of
course
it
is
christina
s
beauty
that
floats
her
people
go
to
see
her
because
they
are
and
they
go
again
because
they
are
charmed
said
rowland
miss
christina
is
a
very
remarkable
young
oh
i
know
it
well
i
had
occasion
to
say
so
to
myself
the
other
day
she
came
to
see
me
of
her
own
free
will
and
for
an
hour
she
was
deeply
interesting
i
think
she
s
an
actress
but
she
believes
in
her
part
while
she
is
playing
it
she
took
it
into
her
head
the
other
day
to
believe
that
she
was
very
unhappy
and
she
sat
there
where
you
are
sitting
and
told
me
a
tale
of
her
miseries
which
brought
tears
into
my
eyes
she
cried
herself
profusely
and
as
naturally
as
possible
she
said
she
was
weary
of
life
and
that
she
knew
no
one
but
me
she
could
speak
frankly
to
she
must
speak
or
she
would
go
mad
she
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
i
assure
you
it
s
well
for
you
susceptible
young
men
that
you
don
t
see
her
when
she
sobs
she
said
in
so
many
words
that
her
mother
was
an
immoral
woman
heaven
knows
what
she
meant
she
meant
i
suppose
that
she
makes
debts
that
she
knows
she
can
t
pay
she
said
the
life
they
led
was
horrible
that
it
was
monstrous
a
poor
girl
should
be
dragged
about
the
world
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
she
was
meant
for
better
things
she
could
be
perfectly
happy
in
poverty
it
was
not
money
she
wanted
i
might
not
believe
her
but
she
really
cared
for
serious
things
sometimes
she
thought
of
taking
poison
what
did
you
say
to
that
i
recommended
her
said
madame
grandoni
to
come
and
see
me
instead
i
would
help
her
about
as
much
and
i
was
on
the
whole
less
unpleasant
of
course
i
could
help
her
only
by
letting
her
talk
herself
out
and
kissing
her
and
patting
her
beautiful
hands
and
telling
her
to
be
patient
and
she
would
be
happy
yet
about
once
in
two
months
i
expect
her
to
reappear
on
the
same
errand
and
meanwhile
to
quite
forget
my
existence
i
believe
i
melted
down
to
the
point
of
telling
her
that
i
would
find
some
good
quiet
affectionate
husband
for
her
but
she
declared
almost
with
fury
that
she
was
sick
unto
death
of
husbands
and
begged
i
would
never
again
mention
the
word
and
in
fact
it
was
a
rash
offer
for
i
am
sure
that
there
is
not
a
man
of
the
kind
that
might
really
make
a
woman
happy
but
would
be
afraid
to
marry
mademoiselle
looked
at
in
that
way
she
is
certainly
very
much
to
be
pitied
and
indeed
altogether
though
i
don
t
think
she
either
means
all
she
says
or
by
a
great
deal
says
all
that
she
means
i
feel
very
sorry
for
rowland
met
the
two
ladies
about
this
time
at
several
entertainments
and
looked
at
christina
with
a
kind
of
distant
attendrissement
he
imagined
more
than
once
that
there
had
been
a
passionate
scene
between
them
about
coming
out
and
wondered
what
arguments
light
had
found
effective
but
christina
s
face
told
no
tales
and
she
moved
about
beautiful
and
silent
looking
absently
over
people
s
heads
barely
heeding
the
men
who
pressed
about
her
and
suggesting
somehow
that
the
soul
of
a
mortal
had
found
its
way
into
the
blooming
body
of
a
goddess
where
in
the
world
has
miss
light
been
before
she
is
twenty
observers
asked
to
have
left
all
her
illusions
behind
and
the
general
verdict
was
that
though
she
was
incomparably
beautiful
she
was
intolerably
proud
young
ladies
to
whom
the
former
distinction
was
not
conceded
were
free
to
reflect
that
she
was
not
at
all
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
guess
however
how
they
reconciled
this
conviction
with
a
variety
of
conflicting
evidence
and
in
especial
with
the
spectacle
of
roderick
s
inveterate
devotion
all
rome
might
behold
that
he
at
least
liked
christina
light
wherever
she
appeared
he
was
either
awaiting
her
or
immediately
followed
her
he
was
perpetually
at
her
side
trying
apparently
to
preserve
the
thread
of
a
disconnected
talk
the
fate
of
which
was
to
judge
by
her
face
profoundly
immaterial
to
the
young
lady
people
in
general
smiled
at
the
radiant
good
faith
of
the
handsome
young
sculptor
and
asked
each
other
whether
he
really
supposed
that
beauties
of
that
quality
were
meant
to
wed
with
poor
artists
but
although
christina
s
deportment
as
i
have
said
was
one
of
superb
inexpressiveness
rowland
had
derived
from
roderick
no
suspicion
that
he
suffered
from
snubbing
and
he
was
therefore
surprised
at
an
incident
which
befell
one
evening
at
a
large
musical
party
roderick
as
usual
was
in
the
field
and
on
the
ladies
taking
the
chairs
which
had
been
arranged
for
them
he
immediately
placed
himself
beside
christina
as
most
of
the
gentlemen
were
standing
his
position
made
him
as
conspicuous
as
hamlet
at
ophelia
s
feet
at
the
play
rowland
was
leaning
somewhat
apart
against
the
there
was
a
long
solemn
pause
before
the
music
began
and
in
the
midst
of
it
christina
rose
left
her
place
came
the
whole
length
of
the
immense
room
with
every
one
looking
at
her
and
stopped
before
him
she
was
neither
pale
nor
flushed
she
had
a
soft
smile
will
you
do
me
a
favor
she
asked
a
thousand
not
now
but
at
your
earliest
convenience
please
remind
hudson
that
he
is
not
in
a
new
england
village
that
it
is
not
the
custom
in
rome
to
address
one
s
conversation
exclusively
night
after
night
to
the
same
poor
girl
and
that
the
music
broke
out
with
a
great
blare
and
covered
her
voice
she
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
rowland
offered
her
his
arm
and
led
her
back
to
her
seat
the
next
day
he
repeated
her
words
to
roderick
who
burst
into
joyous
laughter
she
s
a
delightfully
strange
girl
he
cried
she
must
do
everything
that
comes
into
her
head
had
she
never
asked
you
before
not
to
talk
to
her
so
much
on
the
contrary
she
has
often
said
to
me
mind
you
now
i
forbid
you
to
leave
me
here
comes
that
tiresome
she
cares
as
little
about
the
custom
as
i
do
what
could
be
a
better
proof
than
her
walking
up
to
you
with
five
hundred
people
looking
at
her
is
that
the
custom
for
young
girls
in
rome
why
then
should
she
take
such
a
step
because
as
she
sat
there
it
came
into
her
head
that
s
reason
enough
for
her
i
have
imagined
she
wishes
me
well
as
they
say
here
though
she
has
never
distinguished
me
in
such
a
way
as
that
madame
grandoni
had
foretold
the
truth
light
a
couple
of
weeks
later
convoked
all
roman
society
to
a
brilliant
ball
rowland
went
late
and
found
the
staircase
so
encumbered
with
and
servants
that
he
was
a
long
time
making
his
way
into
the
presence
of
the
hostess
at
last
he
approached
her
as
she
stood
making
courtesies
at
the
door
with
her
daughter
by
her
side
some
of
light
s
courtesies
were
very
low
for
she
had
the
happiness
of
receiving
a
number
of
the
social
potentates
of
the
roman
world
she
was
rosy
with
triumph
to
say
nothing
of
a
less
metaphysical
cause
and
was
evidently
vastly
contented
with
herself
with
her
company
and
with
the
general
promise
of
destiny
her
daughter
was
less
overtly
jubilant
and
distributed
her
greetings
with
impartial
frigidity
she
had
never
been
so
beautiful
dressed
simply
in
vaporous
white
relieved
with
half
a
dozen
white
roses
the
perfection
of
her
features
and
of
her
person
and
the
mysterious
depth
of
her
expression
seemed
to
glow
with
the
white
light
of
a
splendid
pearl
she
recognized
no
one
individually
and
made
her
courtesy
slowly
gravely
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
rowland
fancied
that
as
he
stood
before
her
her
obeisance
was
slightly
exaggerated
as
with
an
intention
of
irony
but
he
smiled
philosophically
to
himself
and
reflected
as
he
passed
into
the
room
that
if
she
disliked
him
he
had
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
he
walked
about
had
a
few
words
with
miss
blanchard
who
with
a
fillet
of
cameos
in
her
hair
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
leavenworth
and
at
last
came
upon
the
cavaliere
giacosa
modestly
stationed
in
a
corner
the
little
gentleman
s
was
decorated
with
an
enormous
bouquet
and
his
neck
encased
in
a
voluminous
white
handkerchief
of
the
fashion
of
thirty
years
ago
his
arms
were
folded
and
he
was
surveying
the
scene
with
contracted
eyelids
through
which
you
saw
the
glitter
of
his
intensely
dark
vivacious
pupil
he
immediately
embarked
on
an
elaborate
apology
for
not
having
yet
manifested
as
he
felt
it
his
sense
of
the
honor
rowland
had
done
him
i
am
always
on
service
with
these
ladies
you
see
he
explained
and
that
is
a
duty
to
which
one
would
not
willingly
be
faithless
for
an
evidently
said
rowland
you
are
a
very
devoted
friend
light
in
her
situation
is
very
happy
in
having
we
are
old
friends
said
the
cavaliere
gravely
old
friends
i
knew
the
signora
many
years
ago
when
she
was
the
prettiest
woman
in
rome
or
rather
in
ancona
which
is
even
better
the
beautiful
christina
now
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
young
girl
in
europe
very
likely
said
rowland
very
well
sir
i
taught
her
to
read
i
guided
her
little
hands
to
touch
the
piano
and
at
these
faded
memories
the
cavaliere
s
eyes
glittered
more
brightly
rowland
half
expected
him
to
proceed
with
a
little
flash
of
passion
and
now
and
now
sir
they
treat
me
as
you
observed
the
other
day
but
the
cavaliere
only
looked
out
at
him
keenly
from
among
his
wrinkles
and
seemed
to
say
with
all
the
vividness
of
the
italian
glance
oh
i
say
nothing
more
i
am
not
so
shallow
as
to
complain
evidently
the
cavaliere
was
not
shallow
and
rowland
repeated
respectfully
you
are
a
devoted
that
s
very
true
i
am
a
devoted
friend
a
man
may
do
himself
justice
after
twenty
years
rowland
after
a
pause
made
some
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
ball
it
was
very
brilliant
stupendous
said
the
cavaliere
solemnly
it
is
a
great
day
we
have
four
roman
princes
to
say
nothing
of
and
he
counted
them
over
on
his
fingers
and
held
up
his
hand
triumphantly
and
there
she
stands
the
girl
to
whom
i
i
giuseppe
giacosa
taught
her
alphabet
and
her
there
she
stands
in
her
incomparable
beauty
and
roman
princes
come
and
bow
to
her
here
in
his
corner
her
old
master
permits
himself
to
be
it
is
very
friendly
of
him
said
rowland
smiling
the
cavaliere
contracted
his
lids
a
little
more
and
gave
another
keen
glance
it
is
very
natural
signore
the
christina
is
a
good
girl
she
remembers
my
little
services
but
here
comes
he
added
in
a
moment
the
young
prince
of
the
fine
arts
i
am
sure
he
has
bowed
lowest
of
rowland
looked
round
and
saw
roderick
moving
slowly
across
the
room
and
casting
about
him
his
usual
luminous
unshrinking
looks
he
presently
joined
them
nodded
familiarly
to
the
cavaliere
and
immediately
demanded
of
rowland
have
you
seen
her
i
have
seen
miss
light
said
rowland
she
s
i
m
half
crazy
cried
roderick
so
loud
that
several
persons
turned
round
rowland
saw
that
he
was
flushed
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
arm
roderick
was
trembling
if
you
will
go
away
rowland
said
instantly
i
will
go
with
go
away
cried
roderick
almost
angrily
i
intend
to
dance
with
her
the
cavaliere
had
been
watching
him
attentively
he
gently
laid
his
hand
on
his
other
arm
softly
softly
dear
young
man
he
said
let
me
speak
to
you
as
a
oh
speak
even
as
an
enemy
and
i
shall
not
mind
it
roderick
answered
frowning
be
very
reasonable
then
and
go
why
the
deuce
should
i
go
away
because
you
are
in
love
said
the
cavaliere
i
might
as
well
be
in
love
here
as
in
the
carry
your
love
as
far
as
possible
from
christina
she
will
not
listen
to
you
she
can
she
can
t
demanded
roderick
she
is
not
a
person
of
whom
you
may
say
that
she
can
if
she
will
she
does
as
she
up
to
a
certain
point
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
i
only
beg
you
to
believe
that
if
you
continue
to
love
miss
light
you
will
be
very
unhappy
have
you
a
princely
title
have
you
a
princely
fortune
otherwise
you
can
never
have
and
the
cavaliere
folded
his
arms
again
like
a
man
who
has
done
his
duty
roderick
wiped
his
forehead
and
looked
askance
at
rowland
he
seemed
to
be
guessing
his
thoughts
and
they
made
him
blush
a
little
but
he
smiled
blandly
and
addressing
the
cavaliere
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
information
he
said
now
that
i
have
obtained
it
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
no
more
in
love
with
miss
light
than
you
are
mallet
knows
that
i
admire
her
yes
profoundly
but
that
s
no
one
s
business
but
my
own
and
though
i
have
as
you
say
neither
a
princely
title
nor
a
princely
fortune
i
mean
to
suffer
neither
those
advantages
nor
those
who
possess
them
to
diminish
my
if
you
are
not
in
love
my
dear
young
man
said
the
cavaliere
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
an
apologetic
smile
so
much
the
better
but
let
me
entreat
you
as
an
affectionate
friend
to
keep
a
watch
on
your
emotions
you
are
young
you
are
handsome
you
have
a
brilliant
genius
and
a
generous
heart
but
i
may
say
it
almost
with
authority
christina
is
not
for
you
whether
roderick
was
in
love
or
not
he
was
nettled
by
what
apparently
seemed
to
him
an
obtrusive
negation
of
an
inspiring
possibility
you
speak
as
if
she
had
made
her
choice
he
cried
without
pretending
to
confidential
information
on
the
subject
i
am
sure
she
has
no
but
she
must
make
it
soon
said
the
cavaliere
and
raising
his
forefinger
he
laid
it
against
his
under
lip
she
must
choose
a
name
and
a
fortune
and
she
will
she
will
do
exactly
as
her
inclination
prompts
she
will
marry
the
man
who
pleases
her
if
he
has
n
t
a
dollar
i
know
her
better
than
the
cavaliere
turned
a
little
paler
than
usual
and
smiled
more
urbanely
no
no
my
dear
young
man
you
do
not
know
her
better
than
i
you
have
not
watched
her
day
by
day
for
twenty
years
i
too
have
admired
her
she
is
a
good
girl
she
has
never
said
an
unkind
word
to
me
the
blessed
virgin
be
thanked
but
she
must
have
a
brilliant
destiny
it
has
been
marked
out
for
her
and
she
will
submit
you
had
better
believe
me
it
may
save
you
much
we
shall
see
said
roderick
with
an
excited
laugh
certainly
we
shall
see
but
i
retire
from
the
discussion
the
cavaliere
added
i
have
no
wish
to
provoke
you
to
attempt
to
prove
to
me
that
i
am
wrong
you
are
already
no
more
than
is
natural
to
a
man
who
in
an
hour
or
so
is
to
dance
the
cotillon
with
miss
the
cotillon
has
she
promised
roderick
patted
the
air
with
a
grand
confidence
you
ll
see
his
gesture
might
almost
have
been
taken
to
mean
that
the
state
of
his
relations
with
miss
light
was
such
that
they
quite
dispensed
with
vain
formalities
the
cavaliere
gave
an
exaggerated
shrug
you
make
a
great
many
mourners
he
has
made
one
already
rowland
murmured
to
himself
this
was
evidently
not
the
first
time
that
reference
had
been
made
between
roderick
and
the
cavaliere
to
the
young
man
s
possible
passion
and
roderick
had
failed
to
consider
it
the
simplest
and
most
natural
course
to
say
in
three
words
to
the
vigilant
little
gentleman
that
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
his
affections
were
preoccupied
rowland
hoped
silently
with
some
dryness
that
his
motives
were
of
a
finer
kind
than
they
seemed
to
be
he
turned
away
it
was
irritating
to
look
at
roderick
s
radiant
unscrupulous
eagerness
the
tide
was
setting
toward
the
and
he
drifted
with
it
to
the
door
the
crowd
at
this
point
was
dense
and
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
some
minutes
before
he
could
advance
at
last
he
felt
his
neighbors
dividing
behind
him
and
turning
he
saw
christina
pressing
her
way
forward
alone
she
was
looking
at
no
one
and
save
for
the
fact
of
her
being
alone
you
would
not
have
supposed
she
was
in
her
mother
s
house
as
she
recognized
rowland
she
beckoned
to
him
took
his
arm
and
motioned
him
to
lead
her
into
the
she
said
nothing
until
he
had
forced
a
passage
and
they
stood
somewhat
isolated
take
me
into
the
most
corner
you
can
find
she
then
said
and
then
go
and
get
me
a
piece
of
nothing
more
there
seems
to
be
everything
a
simple
roll
nothing
more
on
your
peril
only
bring
something
for
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
the
embrasure
of
a
window
embrasures
in
roman
palaces
are
deep
was
a
retreat
sufficiently
obscure
for
miss
light
to
execute
whatever
design
she
might
have
contrived
against
his
equanimity
a
roll
after
he
had
found
her
a
seat
was
easily
procured
as
he
presented
it
he
remarked
that
frankly
speaking
he
was
at
loss
to
understand
why
she
should
have
selected
for
the
honor
of
a
an
individual
for
whom
she
had
so
little
taste
ah
yes
i
dislike
you
said
christina
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
forgotten
it
there
are
so
many
people
here
whom
i
dislike
more
that
when
i
espied
you
just
now
you
seemed
like
an
intimate
friend
but
i
have
not
come
into
this
corner
to
talk
nonsense
she
went
on
you
must
not
think
i
always
do
eh
i
have
never
heard
you
do
anything
else
said
rowland
deliberately
having
decided
that
he
owed
her
no
compliments
very
good
i
like
your
frankness
it
s
quite
true
you
see
i
am
a
strange
girl
to
begin
with
i
am
frightfully
egotistical
don
t
flatter
yourself
you
have
said
anything
very
clever
if
you
ever
take
it
into
your
head
to
tell
me
so
i
know
it
much
better
than
you
so
it
is
i
can
t
help
it
i
am
tired
to
death
of
myself
i
would
give
all
i
possess
to
get
out
of
myself
but
somehow
at
the
end
i
find
myself
so
vastly
more
interesting
than
nine
tenths
of
the
people
i
meet
if
a
person
wished
to
do
me
a
favor
i
would
say
to
him
i
beg
you
with
tears
in
my
eyes
to
interest
me
be
strong
be
positive
be
imperious
if
you
will
only
be
something
something
that
in
looking
at
i
can
forget
my
detestable
self
perhaps
that
is
nonsense
too
if
it
is
i
can
t
help
it
i
can
only
apologize
for
the
nonsense
i
know
to
be
such
and
that
i
talk
oh
for
more
reasons
than
i
can
tell
you
i
wonder
whether
if
i
were
to
try
you
would
understand
i
am
afraid
i
should
never
understand
said
rowland
why
a
person
should
willingly
talk
that
proves
how
little
you
know
about
women
but
i
like
your
frankness
when
i
told
you
the
other
day
that
you
displeased
me
i
had
an
idea
you
were
more
formal
how
do
you
say
it
more
guinde
i
am
very
capricious
i
like
you
oh
i
am
not
guinde
said
rowland
gravely
i
beg
your
pardon
then
for
thinking
so
now
i
have
an
idea
that
you
would
make
a
useful
friend
an
intimate
friend
a
friend
to
whom
one
could
tell
everything
for
such
a
friend
what
would
n
t
i
give
rowland
looked
at
her
in
some
perplexity
was
this
touching
sincerity
or
unfathomable
coquetry
her
beautiful
eyes
looked
divinely
candid
but
then
if
candor
was
beautiful
beauty
was
apt
to
be
subtle
i
hesitate
to
recommend
myself
out
and
out
for
the
office
he
said
but
i
believe
that
if
you
were
to
depend
upon
me
for
anything
that
a
friend
may
do
i
should
not
be
found
very
good
one
of
the
first
things
one
asks
of
a
friend
is
to
judge
one
not
by
isolated
acts
but
by
one
s
whole
conduct
i
care
for
your
opinion
i
don
t
know
nor
do
i
i
confess
said
rowland
with
a
laugh
what
do
you
think
of
this
affair
she
continued
without
heeding
his
laugh
of
your
ball
why
it
s
a
very
grand
it
s
horrible
that
s
what
it
is
it
s
a
mere
rabble
there
are
people
here
whom
i
never
saw
before
people
who
were
never
asked
mamma
went
about
inviting
every
one
asking
other
people
to
invite
any
one
they
knew
doing
anything
to
have
a
crowd
i
hope
she
is
satisfied
it
is
not
my
doing
i
feel
weary
i
feel
angry
i
feel
like
crying
i
have
twenty
minds
to
escape
into
my
room
and
lock
the
door
and
let
mamma
go
through
with
it
as
she
can
by
the
way
she
added
in
a
moment
without
a
visible
reason
for
the
transition
can
you
tell
me
something
to
read
rowland
stared
at
the
disconnectedness
of
the
question
can
you
recommend
me
some
books
she
repeated
i
know
you
are
a
great
reader
i
have
no
one
else
to
ask
we
can
buy
no
books
we
can
make
debts
for
jewelry
and
bonnets
and
gloves
but
we
can
t
spend
a
sou
for
ideas
and
yet
though
you
may
not
believe
it
i
like
ideas
quite
as
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
lend
you
some
books
rowland
said
i
will
pick
some
out
and
send
them
to
no
novels
please
i
am
tired
of
novels
i
can
imagine
better
stories
for
myself
than
any
i
read
some
good
poetry
if
there
is
such
a
thing
nowadays
and
some
memoirs
and
histories
and
books
of
you
shall
be
served
your
taste
agrees
with
my
she
was
silent
a
moment
looking
at
him
then
suddenly
tell
me
something
about
hudson
she
demanded
you
are
great
friends
oh
yes
said
rowland
we
are
great
tell
me
about
him
come
begin
where
shall
i
begin
you
know
him
for
no
i
don
t
know
him
i
don
t
find
him
so
easy
to
know
since
he
has
finished
my
bust
and
begun
to
come
here
disinterestedly
he
has
become
a
great
talker
he
says
very
fine
things
but
does
he
mean
all
he
says
few
of
us
do
you
do
i
imagine
you
ought
to
know
for
he
tells
me
you
discovered
rowland
was
silent
and
christina
continued
do
you
consider
him
very
clever
his
talent
is
really
something
out
of
the
common
way
so
it
seems
to
in
short
he
s
a
man
of
genius
yes
call
it
and
you
found
him
vegetating
in
a
little
village
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
set
him
on
his
feet
in
rome
is
that
the
popular
legend
asked
rowland
oh
you
need
n
t
be
modest
there
was
no
great
merit
in
it
there
would
have
been
none
at
least
on
my
part
in
the
same
circumstances
real
geniuses
are
not
so
common
and
if
i
had
discovered
one
in
the
wilderness
i
would
have
brought
him
out
into
the
to
see
how
he
would
behave
it
would
be
excessively
amusing
you
must
find
it
so
to
watch
hudson
eh
tell
me
this
do
you
think
he
is
going
to
be
a
great
man
become
famous
have
his
life
written
and
all
that
i
don
t
prophesy
but
i
have
good
christina
was
silent
she
stretched
out
her
bare
arm
and
looked
at
it
a
moment
absently
turning
it
so
as
to
see
or
almost
to
see
the
dimple
in
her
elbow
this
was
apparently
a
frequent
gesture
with
her
rowland
had
already
observed
it
it
was
as
coolly
and
naturally
done
as
if
she
had
been
in
her
room
alone
so
he
s
a
man
of
genius
she
suddenly
resumed
don
t
you
think
i
ought
to
be
extremely
flattered
to
have
a
man
of
genius
perpetually
hanging
about
he
is
the
first
i
ever
saw
but
i
should
have
known
he
was
not
a
common
mortal
there
is
something
strange
about
him
to
begin
with
he
has
no
manners
you
may
say
that
it
s
not
for
me
to
blame
him
for
i
have
none
myself
that
s
very
true
but
the
difference
is
that
i
can
have
them
when
i
wish
to
and
very
charming
ones
too
i
ll
show
you
some
day
whereas
hudson
will
never
have
them
and
yet
somehow
one
sees
he
s
a
gentleman
he
seems
to
have
something
urging
driving
pushing
him
making
him
restless
and
defiant
you
see
it
in
his
eyes
they
are
the
finest
by
the
way
i
ever
saw
when
a
person
has
such
eyes
as
that
you
can
forgive
him
his
bad
manners
i
suppose
that
is
what
they
call
the
sacred
rowland
made
no
answer
except
to
ask
her
in
a
moment
if
she
would
have
another
roll
she
merely
shook
her
head
and
went
on
tell
me
how
you
found
him
where
was
he
how
was
he
he
was
in
a
place
called
northampton
did
you
ever
hear
of
it
he
was
studying
law
but
not
learning
it
appears
it
was
something
horrible
eh
something
horrible
this
little
village
no
society
no
pleasures
no
beauty
no
you
have
received
a
false
impression
northampton
is
not
as
gay
as
rome
but
roderick
had
some
charming
tell
me
about
them
who
were
they
well
there
was
my
cousin
through
whom
i
made
his
acquaintance
a
delightful
young
pretty
yes
a
good
deal
of
both
and
very
did
he
make
love
to
her
not
in
the
well
who
else
he
lived
with
his
mother
she
is
the
best
of
ah
yes
i
know
all
that
one
s
mother
is
but
she
does
not
count
as
society
and
who
else
rowland
hesitated
he
wondered
whether
christina
s
insistence
was
the
result
of
a
general
interest
in
roderick
s
antecedents
or
of
a
particular
suspicion
he
looked
at
her
she
was
looking
at
him
a
little
askance
waiting
for
his
answer
as
roderick
had
said
nothing
about
his
engagement
to
the
cavaliere
it
was
probable
that
with
this
beautiful
girl
he
had
not
been
more
explicit
and
yet
the
thing
was
announced
it
was
public
that
other
girl
was
happy
in
it
proud
of
it
rowland
felt
a
kind
of
dumb
anger
rising
in
his
heart
he
deliberated
a
moment
intently
what
are
you
frowning
at
christina
asked
there
was
another
person
he
answered
the
most
important
of
all
the
young
girl
to
whom
he
is
christina
stared
a
moment
raising
her
eyebrows
ah
hudson
is
engaged
she
said
very
simply
is
she
pretty
she
is
not
called
a
beauty
said
rowland
he
meant
to
practice
great
brevity
but
in
a
moment
he
added
i
have
seen
beauties
however
who
pleased
me
ah
she
pleases
you
too
why
don
t
they
marry
roderick
is
waiting
till
he
can
afford
to
christina
slowly
put
out
her
arm
again
and
looked
at
the
dimple
in
her
elbow
ah
he
s
engaged
she
repeated
in
the
same
tone
he
never
told
rowland
perceived
at
this
moment
that
the
people
about
them
were
beginning
to
return
to
the
and
immediately
afterwards
he
saw
roderick
making
his
way
toward
themselves
roderick
presented
himself
before
miss
light
i
don
t
claim
that
you
have
promised
me
the
cotillon
he
said
but
i
consider
that
you
have
given
me
hopes
which
warrant
the
confidence
that
you
will
dance
with
christina
looked
at
him
a
moment
certainly
i
have
made
no
promises
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
the
daughter
of
the
house
i
should
keep
myself
free
and
let
it
depend
on
i
beseech
you
to
dance
with
me
said
roderick
with
vehemence
christina
rose
and
began
to
laugh
you
say
that
very
well
but
the

do
it
this
assertion
seemed
likely
to
be
put
to
the
proof
light
hastily
approached
leading
rather
than
led
by
a
tall
slim
young
man
of
an
unmistakably
southern
physiognomy
my
precious
love
she
cried
what
a
place
to
hide
in
we
have
been
looking
for
you
for
twenty
minutes
i
have
chosen
a
cavalier
for
you
and
chosen
well
the
young
man
disengaged
himself
made
a
ceremonious
bow
joined
his
two
hands
and
murmured
with
an
ecstatic
smile
may
i
venture
to
hope
dear
signorina
for
the
honor
of
your
hand
of
course
you
may
said
light
the
honor
is
for
christina
hesitated
but
for
a
moment
then
swept
the
young
man
a
courtesy
as
profound
as
his
own
bow
you
are
very
kind
but
you
are
too
late
i
have
just
accepted
ah
my
own
darling
murmured
almost
moaned
light
christina
and
roderick
exchanged
a
single
glance
a
glance
brilliant
on
both
sides
she
passed
her
hand
into
his
arm
he
tossed
his
clustering
locks
and
led
her
away
a
short
time
afterwards
rowland
saw
the
young
man
whom
she
had
rejected
leaning
against
a
doorway
he
was
ugly
but
what
is
called
he
had
a
heavy
black
eye
a
sallow
complexion
a
long
thin
neck
his
hair
was
cropped
en
brosse
he
looked
very
young
yet
extremely
bored
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
stroking
an
imperceptible
moustache
rowland
espied
the
cavaliere
giacosa
hard
by
and
having
joined
him
asked
him
the
young
man
s
name
oh
said
the
cavaliere
he

chapter
vi
frascati
one
day
on
entering
roderick
s
lodging
not
the
modest
rooms
on
the
ripetta
which
he
had
first
occupied
but
a
much
more
sumptuous
apartment
on
the
corso
rowland
found
a
letter
on
the
table
addressed
to
himself
it
was
from
roderick
and
consisted
of
but
three
lines
i
am
gone
to
frascati
for
meditation
if
i
am
not
at
home
on
friday
you
had
better
join
on
friday
he
was
still
absent
and
rowland
went
out
to
frascati
here
he
found
his
friend
living
at
the
inn
and
spending
his
days
according
to
his
own
account
lying
under
the
trees
of
the
villa
mondragone
reading
ariosto
he
was
in
a
sombre
mood
meditation
seemed
not
to
have
been
fruitful
nothing
especially
pertinent
to
our
narrative
had
passed
between
the
two
young
men
since
light
s
ball
save
a
few
words
bearing
on
an
incident
of
that
entertainment
rowland
informed
roderick
the
next
day
that
he
had
told
miss
light
of
his
engagement
i
don
t
know
whether
you
ll
thank
me
he
had
said
but
it
s
my
duty
to
let
you
know
it
miss
light
perhaps
has
already
done
roderick
looked
at
him
a
moment
intently
with
his
color
slowly
rising
why
should
n
t
i
thank
you
he
asked
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
as
you
had
not
spoken
of
it
yourself
i
thought
you
might
have
a
reason
for
not
having
it
a
man
does
n
t
gossip
about
such
a
matter
with
strangers
roderick
rejoined
with
the
ring
of
irritation
in
his
voice
with
strangers
no
said
rowland
smiling
roderick
continued
his
work
but
after
a
moment
turning
round
with
a
frown
if
you
supposed
i
had
a
reason
for
being
silent
pray
why
should
you
have
spoken
i
did
not
speak
idly
my
dear
roderick
i
weighed
the
matter
before
i
spoke
and
promised
myself
to
let
you
know
immediately
afterwards
it
seemed
to
me
that
miss
light
had
better
know
that
your
affections
are
the
cavaliere
has
put
it
into
your
head
then
that
i
am
making
love
to
her
no
in
that
case
i
would
not
have
spoken
to
her
do
you
mean
then
that
she
is
making
love
to
me
this
is
what
i
mean
said
rowland
after
a
pause
that
girl
finds
you
interesting
and
is
pleased
even
though
she
may
play
indifference
at
your
finding
her
so
i
said
to
myself
that
it
might
save
her
some
sentimental
disappointment
to
know
without
delay
that
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
become
indefinitely
interested
in
other
you
seem
to
have
taken
the
measure
of
my
liberty
with
extraordinary
minuteness
cried
roderick
you
must
do
me
justice
i
am
the
cause
of
your
separation
from
miss
garland
the
cause
of
your
being
exposed
to
temptations
which
she
hardly
even
suspects
how
could
i
ever
face
her
rowland
demanded
with
much
warmth
of
tone
if
at
the
end
of
it
all
she
should
be
unhappy
i
had
no
idea
that
miss
garland
had
made
such
an
impression
on
you
you
are
too
zealous
i
take
it
she
did
n
t
charge
you
to
look
after
her
if
anything
happens
to
you
i
am
accountable
you
must
understand
that
s
a
view
of
the
situation
i
can
t
accept
in
your
own
interest
no
less
than
in
mine
it
can
only
make
us
both
very
uncomfortable
i
know
all
i
owe
you
i
feel
it
you
know
that
but
i
am
not
a
small
boy
nor
an
outer
barbarian
any
longer
and
whatever
i
do
i
do
with
my
eyes
open
when
i
do
well
the
merit
s
mine
if
i
do
ill
the
fault
s
mine
the
idea
that
i
make
you
nervous
is
detestable
dedicate
your
nerves
to
some
better
cause
and
believe
that
if
miss
garland
and
i
have
a
quarrel
we
shall
settle
it
between
rowland
had
found
himself
wondering
shortly
before
whether
possibly
his
brilliant
young
friend
was
without
a
conscience
now
it
dimly
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
without
a
heart
rowland
as
we
have
already
intimated
was
a
man
with
a
moral
passion
and
no
small
part
of
it
had
gone
forth
into
his
relations
with
roderick
there
had
been
from
the
first
no
protestations
of
friendship
on
either
side
but
rowland
had
implicitly
offered
everything
that
belongs
to
friendship
and
roderick
had
apparently
as
deliberately
accepted
it
rowland
indeed
had
taken
an
exquisite
satisfaction
in
his
companion
s
deep
inexpressive
assent
to
his
interest
in
him
here
is
an
uncommonly
fine
thing
he
said
to
himself
a
nature
unconsciously
grateful
a
man
in
whom
friendship
does
the
thing
that
love
alone
generally
has
the
credit
of
knocks
the
bottom
out
of
pride
his
reflective
judgment
of
roderick
as
time
went
on
had
indulged
in
a
great
many
irrepressible
vagaries
but
his
affection
his
sense
of
something
in
his
companion
s
whole
personality
that
overmastered
his
heart
and
beguiled
his
imagination
had
never
for
an
instant
faltered
he
listened
to
roderick
s
last
words
and
then
he
smiled
as
he
rarely
smiled
with
bitterness
i
don
t
at
all
like
your
telling
me
i
am
too
zealous
he
said
if
i
had
not
been
zealous
i
should
never
have
cared
a
fig
for
roderick
flushed
deeply
and
thrust
his
modeling
tool
up
to
the
handle
into
the
clay
say
it
outright
you
have
been
a
great
fool
to
believe
in
i
desire
to
say
nothing
of
the
kind
and
you
don
t
honestly
believe
i
do
said
rowland
it
seems
to
me
i
am
really
very
even
to
reply
to
such
roderick
sat
down
crossed
his
arms
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
floor
rowland
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
so
clearly
read
his
companion
s
strangely
commingled
character
his
strength
and
his
weakness
his
picturesque
personal
attractiveness
and
his
urgent
egoism
his
exalted
ardor
and
his
puerile
petulance
it
would
have
made
him
almost
sick
however
to
think
that
on
the
whole
roderick
was
not
a
generous
fellow
and
he
was
so
far
from
having
ceased
to
believe
in
him
that
he
felt
just
now
more
than
ever
that
all
this
was
but
the
painful
complexity
of
genius
rowland
who
had
not
a
grain
of
genius
either
to
make
one
say
he
was
an
interested
reasoner
or
to
enable
one
to
feel
that
he
could
afford
a
dangerous
theory
or
two
adhered
to
his
conviction
of
the
essential
salubrity
of
genius
suddenly
he
felt
an
irresistible
compassion
for
his
companion
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
beautiful
faculty
of
production
was
a
instrument
susceptible
of
being
dealt
in
blows
at
its
possessor
genius
was
priceless
inspired
divine
but
it
was
also
at
its
hours
capricious
sinister
cruel
and
men
of
genius
accordingly
were
alternately
very
enviable
and
very
helpless
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
had
a
sense
of
roderick
s
standing
helpless
in
the
grasp
of
his
temperament
it
had
shaken
him
as
yet
but
with
a
half
wantonness
but
henceforth
possibly
it
meant
to
handle
him
more
roughly
these
were
not
times
therefore
for
a
friend
to
have
a
short
patience
when
you
err
you
say
the
fault
s
your
own
he
said
at
last
it
is
because
your
faults
are
your
own
that
i
care
about
rowland
s
voice
when
he
spoke
with
feeling
had
an
extraordinary
amenity
roderick
sat
staring
a
moment
longer
at
the
floor
then
he
sprang
up
and
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
his
friend
s
shoulder
you
are
the
best
man
in
the
world
he
said
and
i
am
a
vile
brute
only
he
added
in
a
moment
you
don
t
understand
me
and
he
looked
at
him
with
eyes
of
such
radiant
lucidity
that
one
might
have
said
and
rowland
did
almost
say
so
himself
that
it
was
the
fault
of
one
s
own
grossness
if
one
failed
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
that
beautiful
soul
rowland
smiled
sadly
what
is
it
now
oh
i
can
t
explain
cried
roderick
impatiently
returning
to
his
work
i
have
only
one
way
of
expressing
my
deepest
feelings
it
s
this
and
he
swung
his
tool
he
stood
looking
at
the
clay
for
a
moment
and
then
flung
the
instrument
down
and
even
this
half
the
time
plays
me
false
rowland
felt
that
his
irritation
had
not
subsided
and
he
himself
had
no
taste
for
saying
disagreeable
things
nevertheless
he
saw
no
sufficient
reason
to
forbear
uttering
the
words
he
had
had
on
his
conscience
from
the
beginning
we
must
do
what
we
can
and
be
thankful
he
said
and
let
me
assure
you
of
this
that
it
won
t
help
you
to
become
entangled
with
miss
roderick
pressed
his
hand
to
his
forehead
with
vehemence
and
then
shook
it
in
the
air
despairingly
a
gesture
that
had
become
frequent
with
him
since
he
had
been
in
italy
no
no
it
s
no
use
you
don
t
understand
me
but
i
don
t
blame
you
you
can
t
you
think
it
will
help
you
then
said
rowland
wondering
i
think
that
when
you
expect
a
man
to
produce
beautiful
and
wonderful
works
of
art
you
ought
to
allow
him
a
certain
freedom
of
action
you
ought
to
give
him
a
long
rope
you
ought
to
let
him
follow
his
fancy
and
look
for
his
material
wherever
he
thinks
he
may
find
it
a
mother
can
t
nurse
her
child
unless
she
follows
a
certain
diet
an
artist
can
t
bring
his
visions
to
maturity
unless
he
has
a
certain
experience
you
demand
of
us
to
be
imaginative
and
you
deny
us
that
which
feeds
the
imagination
in
labor
we
must
be
as
passionate
as
the
inspired
sibyl
in
life
we
must
be
mere
machines
it
won
t
do
when
you
have
got
an
artist
to
deal
with
you
must
take
him
as
he
is
good
and
bad
together
i
don
t
say
they
are
pleasant
fellows
to
know
or
easy
fellows
to
live
with
i
don
t
say
they
satisfy
themselves
any
better
than
other
people
i
only
say
that
if
you
want
them
to
produce
you
must
let
them
conceive
if
you
want
a
bird
to
sing
you
must
not
cover
up
its
cage
shoot
them
the
poor
devils
drown
them
exterminate
them
if
you
will
in
the
interest
of
public
morality
it
may
be
morality
would
gain
i
dare
say
it
would
but
if
you
suffer
them
to
live
let
them
live
on
their
own
terms
and
according
to
their
own
inexorable
needs
rowland
burst
out
laughing
i
have
no
wish
whatever
either
to
shoot
you
or
to
drown
you
he
said
why
launch
such
a
tirade
against
a
warning
offered
you
altogether
in
the
interest
of
your
freest
development
do
you
really
mean
that
you
have
an
inexorable
need
of
embarking
on
a
flirtation
with
miss
light
a
flirtation
as
to
the
felicity
of
which
there
may
be
differences
of
opinion
but
which
can
not
at
best
under
the
circumstances
be
called
innocent
your
last
summer
s
adventures
were
more
so
as
for
the
terms
on
which
you
are
to
live
i
had
an
idea
you
had
arranged
them
otherwise
i
have
arranged
nothing
thank
god
i
don
t
pretend
to
arrange
i
am
young
and
ardent
and
inquisitive
and
i
admire
miss
light
that
s
enough
i
shall
go
as
far
as
admiration
leads
me
i
am
not
afraid
your
genuine
artist
may
be
sometimes
half
a
madman
but
he
s
not
a
coward
suppose
that
in
your
speculation
you
should
come
to
grief
not
only
sentimentally
but
artistically
come
what
come
will
if
i
m
to
fizzle
out
the
sooner
i
know
it
the
better
sometimes
i
half
suspect
it
but
let
me
at
least
go
out
and
reconnoitre
for
the
enemy
and
not
sit
here
waiting
for
him
cudgeling
my
brains
for
ideas
that
won
t
come
do
what
he
would
rowland
could
not
think
of
roderick
s
theory
of
unlimited
experimentation
especially
as
applied
in
the
case
under
discussion
as
anything
but
a
pernicious
illusion
but
he
saw
it
was
vain
to
combat
longer
for
inclination
was
powerfully
on
roderick
s
side
he
laid
his
hand
on
roderick
s
shoulder
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
troubled
eyes
then
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
turned
away
i
can
t
work
any
more
said
roderick
you
have
upset
me
i
ll
go
and
stroll
on
the
and
he
tossed
aside
his
and
prepared
himself
for
the
street
as
he
was
arranging
his
cravat
before
the
glass
something
occurred
to
him
which
made
him
thoughtful
he
stopped
a
few
moments
afterward
as
they
were
going
out
with
his
hand
on
the
you
did
from
your
own
point
of
view
an
indiscreet
thing
he
said
to
tell
miss
light
of
my
rowland
looked
at
him
with
a
glance
which
was
partly
an
interrogation
but
partly
also
an
admission
if
she
s
the
coquette
you
say
roderick
added
you
have
given
her
a
reason
the
and
that
s
the
girl
you
propose
to
devote
yourself
to
cried
rowland
oh
i
don
t
say
it
mind
i
only
say
that
she
s
the
most
interesting
creature
in
the
world
the
next
time
you
mean
to
render
me
a
service
pray
give
me
notice
beforehand
it
was
perfectly
characteristic
of
roderick
that
a
fortnight
later
he
should
have
let
his
friend
know
that
he
depended
upon
him
for
society
at
frascati
as
freely
as
if
no
irritating
topic
had
ever
been
discussed
between
them
rowland
thought
him
generous
and
he
had
at
any
rate
a
liberal
faculty
of
forgetting
that
he
had
given
you
any
reason
to
be
displeased
with
him
it
was
equally
characteristic
of
rowland
that
he
complied
with
his
friend
s
summons
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
his
cousin
cecilia
had
once
told
him
that
he
was
the
dupe
of
his
intense
benevolence
she
put
the
case
with
too
little
favor
or
too
much
as
the
reader
chooses
it
is
certain
at
least
that
he
had
a
constitutional
tendency
towards
magnanimous
interpretations
nothing
happened
however
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
was
deluded
in
thinking
that
roderick
s
secondary
impulses
were
wiser
than
his
primary
ones
and
that
the
rounded
total
of
his
nature
had
a
harmony
perfectly
attuned
to
the
most
amiable
of
its
brilliant
parts
roderick
s
humor
for
the
time
was
pitched
in
a
minor
key
he
was
lazy
listless
and
melancholy
but
he
had
never
been
more
friendly
and
kindly
and
appealingly
submissive
winter
had
begun
by
the
calendar
but
the
weather
was
divinely
mild
and
the
two
young
men
took
long
slow
strolls
on
the
hills
and
lounged
away
the
mornings
in
the
villas
the
villas
at
frascati
are
delicious
places
and
replete
with
romantic
suggestiveness
roderick
as
he
had
said
was
meditating
and
if
a
masterpiece
was
to
come
of
his
meditations
rowland
was
perfectly
willing
to
bear
him
company
and
coax
along
the
process
but
roderick
let
him
know
from
the
first
that
he
was
in
a
miserably
sterile
mood
and
cudgel
his
brains
as
he
would
could
think
of
nothing
that
would
serve
for
the
statue
he
was
to
make
for
leavenworth
it
is
worse
out
here
than
in
rome
he
said
for
here
i
am
face
to
face
with
the
dead
blank
of
my
mind
there
i
could
n
t
think
of
anything
either
but
there
i
found
things
to
make
me
forget
that
i
needed
this
was
as
frank
an
allusion
to
christina
light
as
could
have
been
expected
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
indeed
to
rowland
surprisingly
frank
and
a
pregnant
example
of
his
companion
s
often
strangely
irresponsible
way
of
looking
at
harmful
facts
roderick
was
silent
sometimes
for
hours
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
and
a
constant
fold
between
his
even
eyebrows
at
other
times
he
talked
unceasingly
with
a
slow
idle
drawl
rowland
was
half
a
dozen
times
on
the
point
of
asking
him
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
be
roderick
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
villa
mondragone
and
used
to
declaim
fantastic
compliments
to
it
as
they
strolled
in
the
winter
sunshine
on
the
great
terrace
which
looks
toward
tivoli
and
the
iridescent
sabine
mountains
he
carried
his
volume
of
ariosto
in
his
pocket
and
took
it
out
every
now
and
then
and
spouted
half
a
dozen
stanzas
to
his
companion
he
was
as
a
general
thing
very
little
of
a
reader
but
at
intervals
he
would
take
a
fancy
to
one
of
the
classics
and
peruse
it
for
a
month
in
disjointed
scraps
he
had
picked
up
italian
without
study
and
had
a
wonderfully
sympathetic
accent
though
in
reading
aloud
he
ruined
the
sense
of
half
the
lines
he
rolled
off
so
sonorously
rowland
who
pronounced
badly
but
understood
everything
once
said
to
him
that
ariosto
was
not
the
poet
for
a
man
of
his
craft
a
sculptor
should
make
a
companion
of
dante
so
he
lent
him
the
inferno
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
advised
him
to
look
into
it
roderick
took
it
with
some
eagerness
perhaps
it
would
brighten
his
wits
he
returned
it
the
next
day
with
disgust
he
had
found
it
intolerably
depressing
a
sculptor
should
model
as
dante
writes
you
re
right
there
he
said
but
when
his
genius
is
in
eclipse
dante
is
a
dreadfully
smoky
lamp
by
what
perversity
of
fate
he
went
on
has
it
come
about
that
i
am
a
sculptor
at
all
a
sculptor
is
such
a
confoundedly
special
genius
there
are
so
few
subjects
he
can
treat
so
few
things
in
life
that
bear
upon
his
work
so
few
moods
in
which
he
himself
is
inclined
to
it
may
be
noted
that
rowland
had
heard
him
a
dozen
times
affirm
the
flat
reverse
of
all
this
if
i
had
only
been
a
painter
a
little
quiet
docile
painter
like
our
friend
singleton
i
should
only
have
to
open
my
ariosto
here
to
find
a
subject
to
find
color
and
attitudes
stuffs
and
composition
i
should
only
have
to
look
up
from
the
page
at
that
mouldy
old
fountain
against
the
blue
sky
at
that
cypress
alley
wandering
away
like
a
procession
of
priests
in
couples
at
the
crags
and
hollows
of
the
sabine
hills
to
find
myself
grasping
my
brush
best
of
all
would
be
to
be
ariosto
himself
or
one
of
his
brotherhood
then
everything
in
nature
would
give
you
a
hint
and
every
form
of
beauty
be
part
of
your
stock
you
would
n
t
have
to
look
at
things
only
to
say
with
tears
of
rage
half
the
time
oh
yes
it
s
wonderfully
pretty
but
what
the
deuce
can
i
do
with
it
but
a
sculptor
now
that
s
a
pretty
trade
for
a
fellow
who
has
got
his
living
to
make
and
yet
is
so
damnably
constituted
that
he
can
t
work
to
order
and
considers
that
aesthetically
clock
ornaments
don
t
pay
you
can
t
model
the
cypresses
nor
those
mouldering
old
tritons
and
all
the
sunny
sadness
of
that
fountain
you
can
t
put
the
light
into
marble
the
lovely
caressing
consenting
italian
light
that
you
get
so
much
of
for
nothing
say
that
a
dozen
times
in
his
life
a
man
has
a
complete
sculpturesque
vision
a
vision
in
which
the
imagination
recognizes
a
subject
and
the
subject
kindles
the
imagination
it
is
a
remunerative
rate
of
work
and
the
intervals
are
comfortable
one
morning
as
the
two
young
men
were
lounging
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
slanting
pines
of
the
villa
mondragone
roderick
delivered
himself
of
a
tissue
of
lugubrious
speculations
as
to
the
possible
mischances
of
one
s
genius
what
if
the
watch
should
run
down
he
asked
and
you
should
lose
the
key
what
if
you
should
wake
up
some
morning
and
find
it
stopped
inexorably
appallingly
stopped
such
things
have
been
and
the
poor
devils
to
whom
they
happened
have
had
to
grin
and
bear
it
the
whole
matter
of
genius
is
a
mystery
it
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
we
know
nothing
of
its
mechanism
if
it
gets
out
of
order
we
can
t
mend
it
if
it
breaks
down
altogether
we
can
t
set
it
going
again
we
must
let
it
choose
its
own
pace
and
hold
our
breath
lest
it
should
lose
its
balance
it
s
dealt
out
in
different
doses
in
big
cups
and
little
and
when
you
have
consumed
your
portion
it
s
as
naif
to
ask
for
more
as
it
was
for
oliver
twist
to
ask
for
more
porridge
lucky
for
you
if
you
ve
got
one
of
the
big
cups
we
drink
them
down
in
the
dark
and
we
can
t
tell
their
size
until
we
tip
them
up
and
hear
the
last
gurgle
those
of
some
men
last
for
life
those
of
others
for
a
couple
of
years
nay
what
are
you
smiling
at
so
damnably
he
went
on
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
an
artist
who
has
set
out
on
his
journey
on
a
horse
to
find
himself
all
of
a
sudden
dismounted
and
invited
to
go
his
way
on
foot
you
can
number
them
by
the
thousand
the
people
of
two
or
three
successes
the
poor
fellows
whose
candle
burnt
out
in
a
night
some
of
them
groped
their
way
along
without
it
some
of
them
gave
themselves
up
for
blind
and
sat
down
by
the
wayside
to
beg
who
shall
say
that
i
m
not
one
of
these
who
shall
assure
me
that
my
credit
is
for
an
unlimited
sum
nothing
proves
it
and
i
never
claimed
it
or
if
i
did
i
did
so
in
the
mere
boyish
joy
of
shaking
off
the
dust
of
northampton
if
you
believed
so
my
dear
fellow
you
did
so
at
your
own
risk
what
am
i
what
are
the
best
of
us
but
an
experiment
do
i
succeed
do
i
fail
it
does
n
t
depend
on
me
i
m
prepared
for
failure
it
won
t
be
a
disappointment
simply
because
i
shan
t
survive
it
the
end
of
my
work
shall
be
the
end
of
my
life
when
i
have
played
my
last
card
i
shall
cease
to
care
for
the
game
i
m
not
making
vulgar
threats
of
suicide
for
destiny
i
trust
won
t
add
insult
to
injury
by
putting
me
to
that
abominable
trouble
but
i
have
a
conviction
that
if
the
hour
strikes
here
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
i
shall
disappear
dissolve
be
carried
off
in
a
cloud
for
the
past
ten
days
i
have
had
the
vision
of
some
such
fate
perpetually
swimming
before
my
eyes
my
mind
is
like
a
dead
calm
in
the
tropics
and
my
imagination
as
motionless
as
the
phantom
ship
in
the
ancient
mariner
rowland
listened
to
this
outbreak
as
he
often
had
occasion
to
listen
to
roderick
s
heated
monologues
with
a
number
of
mental
restrictions
both
in
gravity
and
in
gayety
he
said
more
than
he
meant
and
you
did
him
simple
justice
if
you
privately
concluded
that
neither
the
glow
of
purpose
nor
the
chill
of
despair
was
of
so
intense
a
character
as
his
florid
diction
implied
the
moods
of
an
artist
his
exaltations
and
depressions
rowland
had
often
said
to
himself
were
like
the
a
makes
in
the
air
when
he
begins
to
set
his
copy
he
may
bespatter
you
with
ink
he
may
hit
you
in
the
eye
but
he
writes
a
magnificent
hand
it
was
nevertheless
true
that
at
present
poor
roderick
gave
unprecedented
tokens
of
moral
stagnation
and
as
for
genius
being
held
by
the
precarious
tenure
he
had
sketched
rowland
was
at
a
loss
to
see
whence
he
could
borrow
the
authority
to
contradict
him
he
sighed
to
himself
and
wished
that
his
companion
had
a
trifle
more
of
little
sam
singleton
s
evenness
of
impulse
but
then
was
singleton
a
man
of
genius
he
answered
that
such
reflections
seemed
to
him
unprofitable
not
to
say
morbid
that
the
proof
of
the
pudding
was
in
the
eating
that
he
did
n
t
know
about
bringing
a
genius
that
had
palpably
spent
its
last
breath
back
to
life
again
but
that
he
was
satisfied
that
vigorous
effort
was
a
cure
for
a
great
many
ills
that
seemed
far
gone
don
t
heed
your
mood
he
said
and
don
t
believe
there
is
any
calm
so
dead
that
your
own
lungs
can
t
ruffle
it
with
a
breeze
if
you
have
work
to
do
don
t
wait
to
feel
like
it
set
to
work
and
you
will
feel
like
set
to
work
and
produce
abortions
cried
roderick
with
ire
preach
that
to
others
production
with
me
must
be
either
pleasure
or
nothing
as
i
said
just
now
i
must
either
stay
in
the
saddle
or
not
go
at
all
i
won
t
do
work
i
can
t
if
i
would
i
have
no
cleverness
apart
from
inspiration
i
am
not
a
gloriani
you
are
right
he
added
after
a
while
this
is
unprofitable
talk
and
it
makes
my
head
ache
i
shall
take
a
nap
and
see
if
i
can
dream
of
a
bright
idea
or
he
turned
his
face
upward
to
the
parasol
of
the
great
pine
closed
his
eyes
and
in
a
short
time
forgot
his
sombre
fancies
january
though
it
was
the
mild
stillness
seemed
to
vibrate
with
faint
midsummer
sounds
rowland
sat
listening
to
them
and
wishing
that
for
the
sake
of
his
own
felicity
roderick
s
temper
were
graced
with
a
certain
absent
ductility
he
was
brilliant
but
was
he
like
many
brilliant
things
brittle
suddenly
to
his
musing
sense
the
soft
atmospheric
hum
was
overscored
with
distincter
sounds
he
heard
voices
beyond
a
mass
of
shrubbery
at
the
turn
of
a
neighboring
path
in
a
moment
one
of
them
began
to
seem
familiar
and
an
instant
later
a
large
white
poodle
emerged
into
view
he
was
slowly
followed
by
his
mistress
miss
light
paused
a
moment
on
seeing
rowland
and
his
companion
but
though
the
former
perceived
that
he
was
recognized
she
made
no
bow
presently
she
walked
directly
toward
him
he
rose
and
was
on
the
point
of
waking
roderick
but
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
motioned
him
to
forbear
she
stood
a
moment
looking
at
roderick
s
handsome
slumber
what
delicious
oblivion
she
said
happy
man
stenterello
and
she
pointed
to
his
face
wake
him
up
the
poodle
extended
a
long
pink
tongue
and
began
to
lick
roderick
s
cheek
why
asked
rowland
if
he
is
happy
oh
i
want
companions
in
misery
besides
i
want
to
show
off
my
roderick
roused
himself
sat
up
and
stared
by
this
time
light
had
approached
walking
with
a
gentleman
on
each
side
of
her
one
of
these
was
the
cavaliere
giacosa
the
other
was
prince
casamassima
i
should
have
liked
to
lie
down
on
the
grass
and
go
to
sleep
christina
added
but
it
would
have
been
unheard
oh
not
quite
said
the
prince
in
english
with
a
tone
of
great
precision
there
was
already
a
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
charming
cried
light
do
you
hear
that
my
dear
when
the
prince
says
a
brilliant
thing
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
it
said
the
young
girl
your
servant
sir
and
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
grace
that
might
have
reassured
him
if
he
had
thought
her
compliment
ambiguous
roderick
meanwhile
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
light
began
to
exclaim
on
the
oddity
of
their
meeting
and
to
explain
that
the
day
was
so
lovely
that
she
had
been
charmed
with
the
idea
of
spending
it
in
the
country
and
who
would
ever
have
thought
of
finding
mallet
and
hudson
sleeping
under
a
tree
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
not
sleeping
said
rowland
don
t
you
know
that
mallet
is
hudson
s
asked
christina
he
was
mounting
guard
to
keep
away
the
to
indifferent
purpose
madame
said
rowland
indicating
the
young
girl
is
that
the
way
you
spend
your
time
christina
demanded
of
roderick
i
never
yet
happened
to
learn
what
men
were
doing
when
they
supposed
women
were
not
watching
them
but
it
was
something
vastly
below
their
when
pray
said
roderick
smoothing
his
ruffled
locks
are
women
not
watching
them
we
shall
give
you
something
better
to
do
at
any
rate
how
long
have
you
been
here
it
s
an
age
since
i
have
seen
you
we
consider
you
domiciled
here
and
expect
you
to
play
host
and
entertain
roderick
said
that
he
could
offer
them
nothing
but
to
show
them
the
great
terrace
with
its
view
and
ten
minutes
later
the
group
was
assembled
there
light
was
extravagant
in
her
satisfaction
christina
looked
away
at
the
sabine
mountains
in
silence
the
prince
stood
by
frowning
at
the
rapture
of
the
elder
lady
this
is
nothing
he
said
at
last
my
word
of
honor
have
you
seen
the
terrace
at
san
gaetano
ah
that
terrace
murmured
light
amorously
i
suppose
it
is
magnificent
it
is
four
hundred
feet
long
and
paved
with
marble
and
the
view
is
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
this
you
see
far
away
the
blue
blue
sea
and
the
little
smoke
of
vesuvio
christina
love
cried
light
forthwith
the
prince
has
a
terrace
four
hundred
feet
long
all
paved
with
marble
the
cavaliere
gave
a
little
cough
and
began
to
wipe
his
stupendous
said
christina
to
go
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
prince
must
have
out
his
golden
this
was
apparently
an
allusion
to
one
of
the
other
items
of
the
young
man
s
grandeur
you
always
laugh
at
me
said
the
prince
i
know
no
more
what
to
say
she
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
smile
and
shook
her
head
no
no
dear
prince
i
don
t
laugh
at
you
heaven
forbid
you
are
much
too
serious
an
affair
i
assure
you
i
feel
your
importance
what
did
you
inform
us
was
the
value
of
the
hereditary
diamonds
of
the
princess
casamassima
ah
you
are
laughing
at
me
yet
said
the
poor
young
man
standing
rigid
and
pale
it
does
n
t
matter
christina
went
on
we
have
a
note
of
it
mamma
writes
all
those
things
down
in
a
little
book
if
you
are
laughed
at
dear
prince
at
least
it
s
in
company
said
light
caressingly
and
she
took
his
arm
as
if
to
resist
his
possible
displacement
under
the
shock
of
her
daughter
s
sarcasm
but
the
prince
looked
toward
rowland
and
roderick
to
whom
the
young
girl
was
turning
as
if
he
had
much
rather
his
lot
were
cast
with
theirs
is
the
villa
inhabited
christina
asked
pointing
to
the
vast
melancholy
structure
which
rises
above
the
terrace
not
privately
said
roderick
it
is
occupied
by
a
jesuits
college
for
little
can
women
go
in
i
am
afraid
and
roderick
began
to
laugh
fancy
the
poor
little
devils
looking
up
from
their
latin
declensions
and
seeing
miss
light
standing
there
i
should
like
to
see
the
poor
little
devils
with
their
rosy
cheeks
and
their
long
black
gowns
and
when
they
were
pretty
i
should
n
t
scruple
to
kiss
them
but
if
i
can
t
have
that
amusement
i
must
have
some
other
we
must
not
stand
planted
on
this
enchanting
terrace
as
if
we
were
stakes
driven
into
the
earth
we
must
dance
we
must
feast
we
must
do
something
picturesque
mamma
has
arranged
i
believe
that
we
are
to
go
back
to
frascati
to
lunch
at
the
inn
i
decree
that
we
lunch
here
and
send
the
cavaliere
to
the
inn
to
get
the
provisions
he
can
take
the
carriage
which
is
waiting
miss
light
carried
out
this
undertaking
with
unfaltering
ardor
the
cavaliere
was
summoned
and
he
stook
to
receive
her
commands
hat
in
hand
with
his
eyes
cast
down
as
if
she
had
been
a
princess
addressing
her
she
however
laid
her
hand
with
friendly
grace
upon
his
and
called
him
a
dear
good
old
cavaliere
for
being
always
so
willing
her
spirits
had
risen
with
the
occasion
and
she
talked
irresistible
nonsense
bring
the
best
they
have
she
said
no
matter
if
it
ruins
us
and
if
the
best
is
very
bad
it
will
be
all
the
more
amusing
i
shall
enjoy
seeing
mallet
try
to
swallow
it
for
propriety
s
sake
hudson
will
say
out
like
a
man
that
it
s
horrible
stuff
and
that
he
ll
be
choked
first
be
sure
you
bring
a
dish
of
maccaroni
the
prince
must
have
the
diet
of
the
neapolitan
nobility
but
i
leave
all
that
to
you
my
poor
dear
cavaliere
you
know
what
s
good
only
be
sure
above
all
you
bring
a
guitar
mallet
will
play
us
a
tune
i
ll
dance
with
hudson
and
mamma
will
pair
off
with
the
prince
of
whom
she
is
so
fond
and
as
she
concluded
her
recommendations
she
patted
her
bland
old
servitor
caressingly
on
the
shoulder
he
looked
askance
at
rowland
his
little
black
eye
glittered
it
seemed
to
say
did
n
t
i
tell
you
she
was
a
good
girl
the
cavaliere
returned
with
zealous
speed
accompanied
by
one
of
the
servants
of
the
inn
laden
with
a
basket
containing
the
materials
of
a
rustic
luncheon
the
porter
of
the
villa
was
easily
induced
to
furnish
a
table
and
half
a
dozen
chairs
and
the
repast
when
set
forth
was
pronounced
a
perfect
success
not
so
good
as
to
fail
of
the
proper
picturesqueness
nor
yet
so
bad
as
to
defeat
the
proper
function
of
repasts
christina
continued
to
display
the
most
charming
animation
and
compelled
rowland
to
reflect
privately
that
think
what
one
might
of
her
the
harmonious
gayety
of
a
beautiful
girl
was
the
most
beautiful
sight
in
nature
her
was
contagious
roderick
who
an
hour
before
had
been
descanting
on
madness
and
suicide
commingled
his
laughter
with
hers
in
ardent
devotion
prince
casamassima
stroked
his
young
moustache
and
found
a
fine
cool
smile
for
everything
his
neighbor
light
who
had
rowland
on
the
other
side
made
the
friendliest
confidences
to
each
of
the
young
men
and
the
cavaliere
contributed
to
the
general
hilarity
by
the
solemnity
of
his
attention
to
his
plate
as
for
rowland
the
spirit
of
kindly
mirth
prompted
him
to
propose
the
health
of
this
useful
old
gentleman
as
the
effective
author
of
their
pleasure
a
moment
later
he
wished
he
had
held
his
tongue
for
although
the
toast
was
drunk
with
demonstrative
the
cavaliere
received
it
with
various
small
signs
of
eager
which
suggested
to
rowland
that
his
diminished
gentility
but
half
relished
honors
which
had
a
flavor
of
patronage
to
perform
punctiliously
his
mysterious
duties
toward
the
two
ladies
and
to
elude
or
to
baffle
observation
on
his
own
merits
this
seemed
the
cavaliere
s
modest
programme
rowland
perceived
that
light
who
was
not
always
remarkable
for
tact
seemed
to
have
divined
his
humor
on
this
point
she
touched
her
glass
to
her
lips
but
offered
him
no
compliment
and
immediately
gave
another
direction
to
the
conversation
he
had
brought
no
guitar
so
that
when
the
feast
was
over
there
was
nothing
to
hold
the
little
group
together
christina
wandered
away
with
roderick
to
another
part
of
the
terrace
the
prince
whose
smile
had
vanished
sat
gnawing
the
head
of
his
cane
near
light
and
rowland
strolled
apart
with
the
cavaliere
to
whom
he
wished
to
address
a
friendly
word
in
compensation
for
the
discomfort
he
had
inflicted
on
his
modesty
the
cavaliere
was
a
mine
of
information
upon
all
roman
places
and
people
he
told
rowland
a
number
of
curious
anecdotes
about
the
old
villa
mondragone
if
history
could
always
be
taught
in
this
fashion
thought
rowland
it
s
the
ideal
strolling
up
and
down
on
the
very
spot
commemorated
hearing
sympathetic
anecdotes
from
deeply
indigenous
at
last
as
they
passed
rowland
observed
the
mournful
physiognomy
of
prince
casamassima
and
glancing
toward
the
other
end
of
the
terrace
saw
that
roderick
and
christina
had
disappeared
from
view
the
young
man
was
sitting
upright
in
an
attitude
apparently
habitual
of
ceremonious
rigidity
but
his
lower
jaw
had
fallen
and
was
propped
up
with
his
cane
and
his
dull
dark
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
angle
of
the
villa
which
had
just
eclipsed
miss
light
and
her
companion
his
features
were
grotesque
and
his
expression
vacuous
but
there
was
a
lurking
delicacy
in
his
face
which
seemed
to
tell
you
that
nature
had
been
making
casamassimas
for
a
great
many
centuries
and
though
she
adapted
her
mould
to
circumstances
had
learned
to
mix
her
material
to
an
extraordinary
fineness
and
to
perform
the
whole
operation
with
extreme
smoothness
the
prince
was
stupid
rowland
suspected
but
he
imagined
he
was
amiable
and
he
saw
that
at
any
rate
he
had
the
great
quality
of
regarding
himself
in
a
thoroughly
serious
light
rowland
touched
his
companion
s
arm
and
pointed
to
the
melancholy
nobleman
why
in
the
world
does
he
not
go
after
her
and
insist
on
being
noticed
he
asked
oh
he
s
very
proud
said
the
cavaliere
that
s
all
very
well
but
a
gentleman
who
cultivates
a
passion
for
that
young
lady
must
be
prepared
to
make
he
thinks
he
has
already
made
a
great
many
he
comes
of
a
very
great
family
a
race
of
princes
who
for
six
hundred
years
have
married
none
but
the
daughters
of
princes
but
he
is
seriously
in
love
and
he
would
marry
her
and
she
will
not
have
him
ah
she
is
very
proud
too
the
cavaliere
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
he
were
measuring
the
propriety
of
frankness
he
seemed
to
have
formed
a
high
opinion
of
rowland
s
discretion
for
he
presently
continued
it
would
be
a
great
match
for
she
brings
him
neither
a
name
nor
a
fortune
nothing
but
her
beauty
but
the
signorina
will
receive
no
favors
i
know
her
well
she
would
rather
have
her
beauty
blasted
than
seem
to
care
about
the
marriage
and
if
she
ever
accepts
the
prince
it
will
be
only
after
he
has
implored
her
on
his
knees
but
she
does
care
about
it
said
rowland
and
to
bring
him
to
his
knees
she
is
working
upon
his
jealousy
by
pretending
to
be
interested
in
my
friend
hudson
if
you
said
more
you
would
say
that
eh
the
cavaliere
s
shrewdness
exchanged
a
glance
with
rowland
s
by
no
means
miss
light
is
a
singular
girl
she
has
many
romantic
ideas
she
would
be
quite
capable
of
interesting
herself
seriously
in
an
interesting
young
man
like
your
friend
and
doing
her
utmost
to
discourage
a
splendid
suitor
like
the
prince
she
would
act
sincerely
and
she
would
go
very
far
but
it
would
be
unfortunate
for
the
young
man
he
added
after
a
pause
for
at
the
last
she
would
retreat
a
singular
girl
indeed
she
would
accept
the
more
brilliant
parti
i
can
answer
for
and
what
would
be
her
motive
she
would
be
forced
there
would
be
circumstances
i
can
t
tell
you
but
this
implies
that
the
rejected
suitor
would
also
come
back
he
might
grow
tired
of
oh
this
one
is
good
look
at
him
rowland
looked
and
saw
that
the
prince
had
left
his
place
by
light
and
was
marching
restlessly
to
and
fro
between
the
villa
and
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
every
now
and
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
in
this
country
you
know
said
the
cavaliere
a
young
lady
never
goes
walking
alone
with
a
handsome
young
man
it
seems
to
him
very
it
must
seem
to
him
monstrous
and
if
he
overlooks
it
he
must
be
very
much
in
oh
he
will
overlook
it
he
is
far
who
is
this
exemplary
lover
then
what
is
he
a
neapolitan
one
of
the
oldest
houses
in
italy
he
is
a
prince
in
your
english
sense
of
the
word
for
he
has
a
princely
fortune
he
is
very
young
he
is
only
just
of
age
he
saw
the
signorina
last
winter
in
naples
he
fell
in
love
with
her
from
the
first
but
his
family
interfered
and
an
old
uncle
an
ecclesiastic
monsignor
b
hurried
up
to
naples
seized
him
and
locked
him
up
meantime
he
has
passed
his
majority
and
he
can
dispose
of
himself
his
relations
are
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
prevent
his
marrying
miss
light
and
they
have
sent
us
word
that
he
forfeits
his
property
if
he
takes
his
wife
out
of
a
certain
line
i
have
investigated
the
question
minutely
and
i
find
this
is
but
a
fiction
to
frighten
us
he
is
perfectly
free
but
the
estates
are
such
that
it
is
no
wonder
they
wish
to
keep
them
in
their
own
hands
for
italy
it
is
an
extraordinary
case
of
unincumbered
property
the
prince
has
been
an
orphan
from
his
third
year
he
has
therefore
had
a
long
minority
and
made
no
inroads
upon
his
fortune
besides
he
is
very
prudent
and
orderly
i
am
only
afraid
that
some
day
he
will
pull
the
too
tight
all
these
years
his
affairs
have
been
in
the
hands
of
monsignor
b
who
has
managed
them
to
perfection
paid
off
mortagages
planted
forests
opened
up
mines
it
is
now
a
magnificent
fortune
such
a
fortune
as
with
his
name
would
justify
the
young
man
in
pretending
to
any
alliance
whatsoever
and
he
lays
it
all
at
the
feet
of
that
young
girl
who
is
wandering
in
yonder
boschetto
with
a
penniless
he
is
certainly
a
phoenix
of
princes
the
signora
must
be
in
a
state
of
the
cavaliere
looked
imperturbably
grave
the
signora
has
a
high
esteem
for
his
his
character
by
the
way
rejoined
rowland
with
a
smile
what
sort
of
a
character
is
it
eh
prince
casamassima
is
a
veritable
prince
he
is
a
very
good
young
man
he
is
not
brilliant
nor
witty
but
he
ll
not
let
himself
be
made
a
fool
of
he
s
very
grave
and
very
devout
though
he
does
propose
to
marry
a
protestant
he
will
handle
that
point
after
marriage
he
s
as
you
see
him
there
a
young
man
without
many
ideas
but
with
a
very
firm
grasp
of
a
single
one
the
conviction
that
prince
casamassima
is
a
very
great
person
that
he
greatly
honors
any
young
lady
by
asking
for
her
hand
and
that
things
are
going
very
strangely
when
the
young
lady
turns
her
back
upon
him
the
poor
young
man
i
am
sure
is
profoundly
perplexed
but
i
whisper
to
him
every
day
pazienza
signor
principe
so
you
firmly
believe
said
rowland
in
conclusion
that
miss
light
will
accept
him
just
in
time
not
to
lose
him
i
count
upon
it
she
would
make
too
perfect
a
princess
to
miss
her
and
you
hold
that
nevertheless
in
the
mean
while
in
listening
to
say
my
friend
hudson
she
will
have
been
acting
in
good
faith
the
cavaliere
lifted
his
shoulders
a
trifle
and
gave
an
inscrutable
smile
eh
dear
signore
the
christina
is
very
romantic
so
much
so
you
intimate
that
she
will
eventually
retract
in
consequence
not
of
a
change
of
sentiment
but
of
a
mysterious
outward
pressure
if
everything
else
fails
there
is
that
resource
but
it
is
mysterious
as
you
say
and
you
need
n
t
try
to
guess
it
you
will
never
the
poor
signorina
then
will
suffer
not
too
much
i
and
the
poor
young
man
you
maintain
that
there
is
nothing
but
disappointment
in
store
for
the
infatuated
youth
who
loses
his
heart
to
her
the
cavaliere
hesitated
he
had
better
he
said
in
a
moment
go
and
pursue
his
studies
in
florence
there
are
very
fine
antiques
in
the
uffizi
rowland
presently
joined
light
to
whom
her
restless
protege
had
not
yet
returned
that
s
right
she
said
sit
down
here
i
have
something
serious
to
say
to
you
i
am
going
to
talk
to
you
as
a
friend
i
want
your
assistance
in
fact
i
demand
it
it
s
your
duty
to
render
it
look
at
that
unhappy
young
yes
said
rowland
he
seems
he
is
just
come
of
age
he
bears
one
of
the
greatest
names
in
italy
and
owns
one
of
the
greatest
properties
and
he
is
pining
away
with
love
for
my
so
the
cavaliere
tells
the
cavaliere
should
n
t
gossip
said
light
dryly
such
information
should
come
from
me
the
prince
is
pining
as
i
say
he
s
consumed
he
s
devoured
it
s
a
real
italian
passion
i
know
what
that
means
and
the
lady
gave
a
speaking
glance
which
seemed
to
coquet
for
a
moment
with
retrospect
meanwhile
if
you
please
my
daughter
is
hiding
in
the
woods
with
your
dear
friend
hudson
i
could
cry
with
if
things
are
so
bad
as
that
said
rowland
it
seems
to
me
that
you
ought
to
find
nothing
easier
than
to
dispatch
the
cavaliere
to
bring
the
guilty
couple
never
in
the
world
my
hands
are
tied
do
you
know
what
christina
would
do
she
would
tell
the
cavaliere
to
go
about
his
business
heaven
forgive
her
and
send
me
word
that
if
she
had
a
mind
to
she
would
walk
in
the
woods
till
midnight
fancy
the
cavaliere
coming
back
and
delivering
such
a
message
as
that
before
the
prince
think
of
a
girl
wantonly
making
light
of
such
a
chance
as
hers
he
would
marry
her
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
it
is
certainly
very
sad
said
rowland
that
costs
you
little
to
say
if
you
had
left
your
precious
young
meddler
to
vegetate
in
his
native
village
you
would
have
saved
me
a
world
of
distress
nay
you
marched
into
the
jaws
of
danger
said
rowland
you
came
and
disinterred
poor
hudson
in
his
own
secluded
in
an
evil
hour
i
wish
to
heaven
you
would
talk
with
i
have
done
my
i
wish
then
you
would
take
him
away
you
have
plenty
of
money
do
me
a
favor
take
him
to
travel
go
to
the
east
go
to
timbuctoo
then
when
christina
is
princess
casamassima
light
added
in
a
moment
he
may
come
back
if
he
does
she
really
care
for
him
rowland
asked
abruptly
she
thinks
she
does
possibly
she
is
a
living
riddle
she
must
needs
follow
out
every
idea
that
comes
into
her
head
fortunately
most
of
them
don
t
last
long
but
this
one
may
last
long
enough
to
give
the
prince
a
chill
if
that
were
to
happen
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
i
should
be
the
most
miserable
of
women
it
would
be
too
cruel
after
all
i
ve
suffered
to
make
her
what
she
is
to
see
the
labor
of
years
blighted
by
a
caprice
for
i
can
assure
you
sir
light
went
on
that
if
my
daughter
is
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
world
some
of
the
credit
is
rowland
promptly
remarked
that
this
was
obvious
he
saw
that
the
lady
s
irritated
nerves
demanded
comfort
from
flattering
reminiscence
and
he
assumed
designedly
the
attitude
of
a
zealous
auditor
she
began
to
retail
her
efforts
her
hopes
her
dreams
her
presentiments
her
disappointments
in
the
cause
of
her
daughter
s
matrimonial
fortunes
it
was
a
long
story
and
while
it
was
being
unfolded
the
prince
continued
to
pass
to
and
fro
stiffly
and
solemnly
like
a
pendulum
marking
the
time
allowed
for
the
young
lady
to
come
to
her
senses
light
evidently
at
an
early
period
had
gathered
her
maternal
hopes
into
a
sacred
sheaf
which
she
said
her
prayers
and
burnt
incense
to
and
treated
like
a
sort
of
fetish
they
had
been
her
religion
she
had
none
other
and
she
performed
her
devotions
bravely
and
cheerily
in
the
light
of
day
the
poor
old
fetish
had
been
so
caressed
and
manipulated
so
thrust
in
and
out
of
its
niche
so
passed
from
hand
to
hand
so
dressed
and
undressed
so
mumbled
and
fumbled
over
that
it
had
lost
by
this
time
much
of
its
early
freshness
and
seemed
a
rather
battered
and
disfeatured
divinity
but
it
was
still
brought
forth
in
moments
of
trouble
to
have
its
tinseled
petticoat
twisted
about
and
be
set
up
on
its
altar
rowland
observed
that
light
had
a
genuine
maternal
conscience
she
considered
that
she
had
been
performing
a
sacred
duty
in
bringing
up
christina
to
set
her
cap
for
a
prince
and
when
the
future
looked
dark
she
found
consolation
in
thinking
that
destiny
could
never
have
the
heart
to
deal
a
blow
at
so
deserving
a
person
this
conscience
upside
down
presented
to
rowland
s
fancy
a
real
physical
image
he
was
on
the
point
half
a
dozen
times
of
bursting
out
laughing
i
don
t
know
whether
you
believe
in
presentiments
said
light
and
i
don
t
care
i
have
had
one
for
the
last
fifteen
years
people
have
laughed
at
it
but
they
have
n
t
laughed
me
out
of
it
it
has
been
everything
to
me
i
could
n
t
have
lived
without
it
one
must
believe
in
something
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
when
christina
was
five
years
old
i
remember
the
day
and
the
place
as
if
it
were
yesterday
she
was
a
very
ugly
baby
for
the
first
two
years
i
could
hardly
bear
to
look
at
her
and
i
used
to
spoil
my
own
looks
with
crying
about
her
she
had
an
italian
nurse
who
was
very
fond
of
her
and
insisted
that
she
would
grow
up
pretty
i
could
n
t
believe
her
i
used
to
contradict
her
and
we
were
forever
squabbling
i
was
just
a
little
silly
in
those
days
surely
i
may
say
it
now
and
i
was
very
fond
of
being
amused
if
my
daughter
was
ugly
it
was
not
that
she
resembled
her
mamma
i
had
no
lack
of
amusement
people
accused
me
i
believe
of
neglecting
my
little
girl
if
it
was
so
i
ve
made
up
for
it
since
one
day
i
went
to
drive
on
the
pincio
in
very
low
spirits
a
trusted
friend
had
greatly
disappointed
me
while
i
was
there
he
passed
me
in
a
carriage
driving
with
a
horrible
woman
who
had
made
trouble
between
us
i
got
out
of
my
carriage
to
walk
about
and
at
last
sat
down
on
a
bench
i
can
show
you
the
spot
at
this
hour
while
i
sat
there
a
child
came
wandering
along
the
path
a
little
girl
of
four
or
five
very
fantastically
dressed
in
crimson
and
orange
she
stopped
in
front
of
me
and
stared
at
me
and
i
stared
at
her
queer
little
dress
which
was
a
cheap
imitation
of
the
costume
of
one
of
these
contadine
at
last
i
looked
up
at
her
face
and
said
to
myself
bless
me
what
a
beautiful
child
what
a
splendid
pair
of
eyes
what
a
magnificent
head
of
hair
if
my
poor
christina
were
only
like
that
the
child
turned
away
slowly
but
looking
back
with
its
eyes
fixed
on
me
all
of
a
sudden
i
gave
a
cry
pounced
on
it
pressed
it
in
my
arms
and
covered
it
with
kisses
it
was
christina
my
own
precious
child
so
disguised
by
the
ridiculous
dress
which
the
nurse
had
amused
herself
in
making
for
her
that
her
own
mother
had
not
recognized
her
she
knew
me
but
she
said
afterwards
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
me
because
i
looked
so
angry
of
course
my
face
was
sad
i
rushed
with
my
child
to
the
carriage
drove
home
pulled
off
her
rags
and
as
i
may
say
wrapped
her
in
cotton
i
had
been
blind
i
had
been
insane
she
was
a
creature
in
ten
millions
she
was
to
be
a
beauty
of
beauties
a
priceless
treasure
every
day
after
that
the
certainty
grew
from
that
time
i
lived
only
for
my
daughter
i
watched
her
i
caressed
her
from
morning
till
night
i
worshipped
her
i
went
to
see
doctors
about
her
i
took
every
sort
of
advice
i
was
determined
she
should
be
perfection
the
things
that
have
been
done
for
that
girl
sir
you
would
n
t
believe
them
they
would
make
you
smile
nothing
was
spared
if
i
had
been
told
that
she
must
have
a
bath
every
morning
of
molten
pearls
i
would
have
found
means
to
give
it
to
her
she
never
raised
a
finger
for
herself
she
breathed
nothing
but
perfumes
she
walked
upon
velvet
she
never
was
out
of
my
sight
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
said
a
sharp
word
to
her
by
the
time
she
was
ten
years
old
she
was
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
so
noticed
wherever
we
went
that
i
had
to
make
her
wear
a
veil
like
a
woman
of
twenty
her
hair
reached
down
to
her
feet
her
hands
were
the
hands
of
a
princess
then
i
saw
that
she
was
as
clever
as
she
was
beautiful
and
that
she
had
only
to
play
her
cards
she
had
masters
professors
every
educational
advantage
they
told
me
she
was
a
little
prodigy
she
speaks
french
italian
german
better
than
most
natives
she
has
a
wonderful
genius
for
music
and
might
make
her
fortune
as
a
pianist
if
it
was
not
made
for
her
otherwise
i
traveled
all
over
europe
every
one
told
me
she
was
a
marvel
the
director
of
the
opera
in
paris
saw
her
dance
at
a
child
s
party
at
spa
and
offered
me
an
enormous
sum
if
i
would
give
her
up
to
him
and
let
him
have
her
educated
for
the
ballet
i
said
no
i
thank
you
sir
she
is
meant
to
be
something
finer
than
a
princesse
de
i
had
a
passionate
belief
that
she
might
marry
absolutely
whom
she
chose
that
she
might
be
a
princess
out
and
out
it
has
never
left
me
till
this
hour
and
i
can
assure
you
that
it
has
sustained
me
in
many
embarrassments
financial
some
of
them
i
don
t
mind
confessing
it
i
have
raised
money
on
that
girl
s
face
i
ve
taken
her
to
the
jews
and
bade
her
put
up
her
veil
and
asked
if
the
mother
of
that
young
lady
was
not
safe
she
of
course
was
too
young
to
understand
me
and
yet
as
a
child
you
would
have
said
she
knew
what
was
in
store
for
her
before
she
could
read
she
had
the
manners
the
tastes
the
instincts
of
a
little
princess
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
shabby
things
or
shabby
people
if
she
stained
one
of
her
frocks
she
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
frenzy
and
tore
it
to
pieces
at
nice
at
baden
at
brighton
wherever
we
stayed
she
used
to
be
sent
for
by
all
the
great
people
to
play
with
their
children
she
has
played
at
with
people
who
now
stand
on
the
steps
of
thrones
i
have
gone
so
far
as
to
think
at
times
that
those
childish
kisses
were
a
sign
a
symbol
a
portent
you
may
laugh
at
me
if
you
like
but
have
n
t
such
things
happened
again
and
again
without
half
as
good
a
cause
and
does
n
t
history
notoriously
repeat
itself
there
was
a
little
spanish
girl
at
a
english
thirty
years
ago
the
empress
certainly
is
a
pretty
woman
but
what
is
my
christina
pray
i
ve
dreamt
of
it
sometimes
every
night
for
a
month
i
won
t
tell
you
i
have
been
to
consult
those
old
women
who
advertise
in
the
newspapers
you
ll
call
me
an
old
imbecile
imbecile
if
you
please
i
have
refused
magnificent
offers
because
i
believed
that
somehow
or
other
if
wars
and
revolutions
were
needed
to
bring
it
about
we
should
have
nothing
less
than
that
there
might
be
another
coup
d
etat
somewhere
and
another
brilliant
young
sovereign
looking
out
for
a
wife
at
last
however
light
proceeded
with
incomparable
gravity
since
the
overturning
of
the
poor
king
of
naples
and
that
charming
queen
and
the
expulsion
of
all
those
dear
little
italian
and
the
dreadful
radical
talk
that
is
going
on
all
over
the
world
it
has
come
to
seem
to
me
that
with
christina
in
such
a
position
i
should
be
really
very
nervous
even
in
such
a
position
she
would
hold
her
head
very
high
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
her
she
would
make
no
concessions
to
the
popular
fury
the
best
thing
if
one
is
prudent
seems
to
be
a
nobleman
of
the
highest
possible
rank
short
of
belonging
to
a
reigning
stock
there
you
see
one
striding
up
and
down
looking
at
his
watch
and
counting
the
minutes
till
my
daughter
reappears
rowland
listened
to
all
this
with
a
huge
compassion
for
the
heroine
of
the
tale
what
an
education
what
a
history
what
a
school
of
character
and
of
morals
he
looked
at
the
prince
and
wondered
whether
he
too
had
heard
light
s
story
if
he
had
he
was
a
brave
man
i
certainly
hope
you
ll
keep
him
he
said
to
light
you
have
played
a
dangerous
game
with
your
daughter
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
win
but
there
is
hope
for
you
yet
here
she
comes
at
last
christina
reappeared
as
he
spoke
these
words
strolling
beside
her
companion
with
the
same
indifferent
tread
with
which
she
had
departed
rowland
imagined
that
there
was
a
faint
pink
flush
in
her
cheek
which
she
had
not
carried
away
with
her
and
there
was
certainly
a
light
in
roderick
s
eyes
which
he
had
not
seen
there
for
a
week
bless
my
soul
how
they
are
all
looking
at
us
she
cried
as
they
advanced
one
would
think
we
were
prisoners
of
the
inquisition
and
she
paused
and
glanced
from
the
prince
to
her
mother
and
from
rowland
to
the
cavaliere
and
then
threw
back
her
head
and
burst
into
laughter
what
is
it
pray
have
i
been
very
improper
am
i
ruined
forever
dear
prince
you
are
looking
at
me
as
if
i
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
i
myself
said
the
prince
would
never
have
ventured
to
ask
you
to
walk
with
me
alone
in
the
country
for
an
hour
the
more
fool
you
dear
prince
as
the
vulgar
say
our
walk
has
been
charming
i
hope
you
on
your
side
have
enjoyed
each
other
s
my
dear
daughter
said
light
taking
the
arm
of
her
predestined
i
shall
have
something
serious
to
say
to
you
when
we
reach
home
we
will
go
back
to
the
something
serious
decidedly
it
is
the
inquisition
hudson
stand
firm
and
let
us
agree
to
make
no
confessions
without
conferring
previously
with
each
other
they
may
put
us
on
the
rack
first
mallet
i
see
also
christina
added
has
something
serious
to
say
to
me
rowland
had
been
looking
at
her
with
the
shadow
of
his
pity
in
his
eyes
possibly
he
said
but
it
must
be
for
some
other
i
am
at
your
service
i
see
our
is
gone
and
i
only
wanted
to
be
amiable
it
is
very
discouraging
cavaliere
you
only
look
as
if
you
had
a
little
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
left
from
your
venerable
visage
at
least
there
is
no
telling
what
you
think
give
me
your
arm
and
take
me
away
the
party
took
its
course
back
to
the
carriage
which
was
waiting
in
the
grounds
of
the
villa
and
rowland
and
roderick
bade
their
friends
farewell
christina
threw
herself
back
in
her
seat
and
closed
her
eyes
a
manoeuvre
for
which
rowland
imagined
the
prince
was
grateful
as
it
enabled
him
to
look
at
her
without
seeming
to
depart
from
his
attitude
of
distinguished
disapproval
rowland
found
himself
aroused
from
sleep
early
the
next
morning
to
see
roderick
standing
before
him
dressed
for
departure
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
i
am
off
he
said
i
am
back
to
work
i
have
an
idea
i
must
strike
while
the
iron
s
hot
farewell
and
he
departed
by
the
first
train
rowland
went
alone
by
the
next
chapter
vii
saint
cecilia
s
rowland
went
often
to
the
coliseum
he
never
wearied
of
it
one
morning
about
a
month
after
his
return
from
frascati
as
he
was
strolling
across
the
vast
arena
he
observed
a
young
woman
seated
on
one
of
the
fragments
of
stone
which
are
ranged
along
the
line
of
the
ancient
parapet
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
seen
her
before
but
he
was
unable
to
localize
her
face
passing
her
again
he
perceived
that
one
of
the
little
french
soldiers
at
that
time
on
guard
there
had
approached
her
and
was
gallantly
making
himself
agreeable
she
smiled
brilliantly
and
rowland
recognized
the
smile
it
had
always
pleased
him
of
a
certain
comely
assunta
who
sometimes
opened
the
door
for
light
s
visitors
he
wondered
what
she
was
doing
alone
in
the
coliseum
and
conjectured
that
assunta
had
admirers
as
well
as
her
young
mistress
but
that
being
without
the
same
domiciliary
conveniencies
she
was
using
this
massive
heritage
of
her
latin
ancestors
as
a
boudoir
in
other
words
she
had
an
appointment
with
her
lover
who
had
better
from
present
appearances
be
punctual
it
was
a
long
time
since
rowland
had
ascended
to
the
ruinous
upper
tiers
of
the
great
circus
and
as
the
day
was
radiant
and
the
distant
views
promised
to
be
particularly
clear
he
determined
to
give
himself
the
pleasure
the
custodian
unlocked
the
great
wooden
wicket
and
he
climbed
through
the
winding
shafts
where
the
eager
roman
crowds
had
billowed
and
trampled
not
pausing
till
he
reached
the
highest
accessible
point
of
the
ruin
the
views
were
as
fine
as
he
had
supposed
the
lights
on
the
sabine
mountains
had
never
been
more
lovely
he
gazed
to
his
satisfaction
and
retraced
his
steps
in
a
moment
he
paused
again
on
an
abutment
somewhat
lower
from
which
the
glance
dropped
dizzily
into
the
interior
there
are
chance
anfractuosities
of
ruin
in
the
upper
portions
of
the
coliseum
which
offer
a
very
fair
imitation
of
the
rugged
face
of
an
alpine
cliff
in
those
days
a
multitude
of
delicate
flowers
and
sprays
of
wild
herbage
had
found
a
friendly
soil
in
the
hoary
crevices
and
they
bloomed
and
nodded
amid
the
antique
masonry
as
freely
as
they
would
have
done
in
the
virgin
rock
rowland
was
turning
away
when
he
heard
a
sound
of
voices
rising
up
from
below
he
had
but
to
step
slightly
forward
to
find
himself
overlooking
two
persons
who
had
seated
themselves
on
a
narrow
ledge
in
a
sunny
corner
they
had
apparently
had
an
eye
to
extreme
privacy
but
they
had
not
observed
that
their
position
was
commanded
by
rowland
s
one
of
these
airy
adventurers
was
a
lady
thickly
veiled
so
that
even
if
he
had
not
been
standing
directly
above
her
rowland
could
not
have
seen
her
face
the
other
was
a
young
man
whose
face
was
also
invisible
but
who
as
rowland
stood
there
gave
a
toss
of
his
clustering
locks
which
was
equivalent
to
the
signature
roderick
hudson
a
moment
s
reflection
hereupon
satisfied
him
of
the
identity
of
the
lady
he
had
been
unjust
to
poor
assunta
sitting
patient
in
the
gloomy
arena
she
had
not
come
on
her
own
errand
rowland
s
discoveries
made
him
hesitate
should
he
retire
as
noiselessly
as
possible
or
should
he
call
out
a
friendly
good
morning
while
he
was
debating
the
question
he
found
himself
distinctly
hearing
his
friends
words
they
were
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
him
unwilling
to
retreat
and
yet
to
make
it
awkward
to
be
discovered
in
a
position
where
it
would
be
apparent
that
he
had
heard
them
if
what
you
say
is
true
said
christina
with
her
usual
soft
deliberateness
it
made
her
words
rise
with
peculiar
distinctness
to
rowland
s
ear
you
are
simply
weak
i
am
sorry
i
hoped
i
really
believed
you
were
no
i
am
not
weak
answered
roderick
with
vehemence
i
maintain
that
i
am
not
weak
i
am
incomplete
perhaps
but
i
can
t
help
that
weakness
is
a
man
s
own
fault
incomplete
then
said
christina
with
a
laugh
it
s
the
same
thing
so
long
as
it
keeps
you
from
splendid
achievement
is
it
written
then
that
i
shall
really
never
know
what
i
have
so
often
dreamed
of
what
have
you
dreamed
of
a
man
whom
i
can
perfectly
respect
cried
the
young
girl
with
a
sudden
flame
a
man
at
least
whom
i
can
unrestrictedly
admire
i
meet
one
as
i
have
met
more
than
one
before
whom
i
fondly
believe
to
be
cast
in
a
larger
mould
than
most
of
the
vile
human
breed
to
be
large
in
character
great
in
talent
strong
in
will
in
such
a
man
as
that
i
say
one
s
weary
imagination
at
last
may
rest
or
it
may
wander
if
it
will
yet
never
need
to
wander
far
from
the
deeps
where
one
s
heart
is
anchored
when
i
first
knew
you
i
gave
no
sign
but
you
had
struck
me
i
observed
you
as
women
observe
and
i
fancied
you
had
the
sacred
before
heaven
i
believe
i
have
cried
roderick
ah
but
so
little
it
flickers
and
trembles
and
sputters
it
goes
out
you
tell
me
for
whole
weeks
together
from
your
own
account
it
s
ten
to
one
that
in
the
long
run
you
re
a
i
say
those
things
sometimes
myself
but
when
i
hear
you
say
them
they
make
me
feel
as
if
i
could
work
twenty
years
at
a
sitting
on
purpose
to
refute
you
ah
the
man
who
is
strong
with
what
i
call
strength
christina
replied
would
neither
rise
nor
fall
by
anything
i
could
say
i
am
a
poor
weak
woman
i
have
no
strength
myself
and
i
can
give
no
strength
i
am
a
miserable
medley
of
vanity
and
folly
i
am
silly
i
am
ignorant
i
am
affected
i
am
false
i
am
the
fruit
of
a
horrible
education
sown
on
a
worthless
soil
i
am
all
that
and
yet
i
believe
i
have
one
merit
i
should
know
a
great
character
when
i
saw
it
and
i
should
delight
in
it
with
a
generosity
which
would
do
something
toward
the
remission
of
my
sins
for
a
man
who
should
really
give
me
a
certain
feeling
which
i
have
never
had
but
which
i
should
know
when
it
came
i
would
send
prince
casamassima
and
his
millions
to
perdition
i
don
t
know
what
you
think
of
me
for
saying
all
this
i
suppose
we
have
not
climbed
up
here
under
the
skies
to
play
propriety
why
have
you
been
at
such
pains
to
assure
me
after
all
that
you
are
a
little
man
and
not
a
great
one
a
weak
one
and
not
a
strong
i
innocently
imagined
that
your
eyes
declared
you
were
strong
but
your
voice
condemns
you
i
always
wondered
at
it
it
s
not
the
voice
of
a
conqueror
give
me
something
to
conquer
cried
roderick
and
when
i
say
that
i
thank
you
from
my
soul
my
voice
whatever
you
think
of
it
shall
speak
the
truth
christina
for
a
moment
said
nothing
rowland
was
too
interested
to
think
of
moving
you
pretend
to
such
devotion
she
went
on
and
yet
i
am
sure
you
have
never
really
chosen
between
me
and
that
person
in
do
me
the
favor
not
to
speak
of
her
said
roderick
imploringly
why
not
i
say
no
ill
of
her
and
i
think
all
kinds
of
good
i
am
certain
she
is
a
far
better
girl
than
i
and
far
more
likely
to
make
you
this
is
happiness
this
present
palpable
moment
said
roderick
though
you
have
such
a
genius
for
saying
the
things
that
torture
me
it
s
greater
happiness
than
you
deserve
then
you
have
never
chosen
i
say
you
have
been
afraid
to
choose
you
have
never
really
faced
the
fact
that
you
are
false
that
you
have
broken
your
faith
you
have
never
looked
at
it
and
seen
that
it
was
hideous
and
yet
said
no
matter
i
ll
brave
the
penalty
i
ll
bear
the
shame
you
have
closed
your
eyes
you
have
tried
to
stifle
remembrance
to
persuade
yourself
that
you
were
not
behaving
as
badly
as
you
seemed
to
be
and
there
would
be
some
way
after
all
of
compassing
bliss
and
yet
escaping
trouble
you
have
faltered
and
drifted
you
have
gone
on
from
accident
to
accident
and
i
am
sure
that
at
this
present
moment
you
can
t
tell
what
it
is
you
really
desire
roderick
was
sitting
with
his
knees
drawn
up
and
bent
and
his
hands
clapsed
around
his
legs
he
bent
his
head
and
rested
his
forehead
on
his
knees
christina
went
on
with
a
sort
of
infernal
calmness
i
believe
that
really
you
don
t
greatly
care
for
your
friend
in
america
any
more
than
you
do
for
me
you
are
one
of
the
men
who
care
only
for
themselves
and
for
what
they
can
make
of
themselves
that
s
very
well
when
they
can
make
something
great
and
i
could
interest
myself
in
a
man
of
extraordinary
power
who
should
wish
to
turn
all
his
passions
to
account
but
if
the
power
should
turn
out
to
be
after
all
rather
ordinary
fancy
feeling
one
s
self
ground
in
the
mill
of
a
talent
if
you
have
doubts
about
yourself
i
can
t
reassure
you
i
have
too
many
doubts
myself
about
everything
in
this
weary
world
you
have
gone
up
like
a
rocket
in
your
profession
they
tell
me
are
you
going
to
come
down
like
the
stick
i
don
t
pretend
to
know
i
repeat
frankly
what
i
have
said
before
that
all
modern
sculpture
seems
to
me
weak
and
that
the
only
things
i
care
for
are
some
of
the
most
battered
of
the
antiques
of
the
vatican
no
no
i
can
t
reassure
you
and
when
you
tell
me
with
a
confidence
in
my
discretion
of
which
certainly
i
am
duly
sensible
that
at
times
you
feel
terribly
small
why
i
can
only
answer
ah
then
my
poor
friend
i
am
afraid
you
are
the
language
i
should
like
to
hear
from
a
certain
person
would
be
the
language
of
absolute
roderick
raised
his
head
but
he
said
nothing
he
seemed
to
be
exchanging
a
long
glance
with
his
companion
the
result
of
it
was
to
make
him
fling
himself
back
with
an
inarticulate
murmur
rowland
admonished
by
the
silence
was
on
the
point
of
turning
away
but
he
was
arrested
by
a
gesture
of
the
young
girl
she
pointed
for
a
moment
into
the
blue
air
roderick
followed
the
direction
of
her
gesture
is
that
little
flower
we
see
outlined
against
that
dark
niche
she
asked
as
intensely
blue
as
it
looks
through
my
veil
she
spoke
apparently
with
the
amiable
design
of
directing
the
conversation
into
a
less
painful
channel
rowland
from
where
he
stood
could
see
the
flower
she
meant
a
delicate
plant
of
radiant
hue
which
sprouted
from
the
top
of
an
immense
fragment
of
wall
some
twenty
feet
from
christina
s
place
roderick
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
it
without
answering
at
last
glancing
round
put
up
your
veil
he
said
christina
complied
does
it
look
as
blue
now
he
asked
ah
what
a
lovely
color
she
murmured
leaning
her
head
on
one
side
would
you
like
to
have
it
she
stared
a
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
light
laugh
would
you
like
to
have
it
he
repeated
in
a
ringing
voice
don
t
look
as
if
you
would
eat
me
up
she
answered
it
s
harmless
if
i
say
yes
roderick
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
at
the
little
flower
it
was
separated
from
the
ledge
on
which
he
stood
by
a
rugged
surface
of
vertical
wall
which
dropped
straight
into
the
dusky
vaults
behind
the
arena
suddenly
he
took
off
his
hat
and
flung
it
behind
him
christina
then
sprang
to
her
feet
i
will
bring
it
you
he
said
she
seized
his
arm
are
you
crazy
do
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
i
shall
not
kill
myself
sit
down
excuse
me
not
till
you
do
and
she
grasped
his
arm
with
both
hands
roderick
shook
her
off
and
pointed
with
a
violent
gesture
to
her
former
place
go
there
he
cried
fiercely
you
can
never
never
she
murmured
beseechingly
clasping
her
hands
i
implore
you
roderick
turned
and
looked
at
her
and
then
in
a
voice
which
rowland
had
never
heard
him
use
a
voice
almost
thunderous
a
voice
which
awakened
the
echoes
of
the
mighty
ruin
he
repeated
sit
down
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
she
dropped
on
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
rowland
had
seen
all
this
and
he
saw
more
he
saw
roderick
clasp
in
his
left
arm
the
jagged
corner
of
the
vertical
partition
along
which
he
proposed
to
pursue
his
crazy
journey
stretch
out
his
leg
and
feel
for
a
for
his
foot
rowland
had
measured
with
a
glance
the
possibility
of
his
sustaining
himself
and
pronounced
it
absolutely
nil
the
wall
was
garnished
with
a
series
of
narrow
projections
the
remains
apparently
of
a
brick
cornice
supporting
the
arch
of
a
vault
which
had
long
since
collapsed
it
was
by
lodging
his
toes
on
these
loose
brackets
and
grasping
with
his
hands
at
certain
mouldering
protuberances
on
a
level
with
his
head
that
roderick
intended
to
proceed
the
relics
of
the
cornice
were
utterly
worthless
as
a
support
rowland
had
observed
this
and
yet
for
a
moment
he
had
hesitated
if
the
thing
were
possible
he
felt
a
sudden
admiring
glee
at
the
thought
of
roderick
s
doing
it
it
would
be
finely
done
it
would
be
gallant
it
would
have
a
sort
of
masculine
eloquence
as
an
answer
to
christina
s
sinister
persiflage
but
it
was
not
possible
rowland
left
his
place
with
a
bound
and
scrambled
down
some
neighboring
steps
and
the
next
moment
a
stronger
pair
of
hands
than
christina
s
were
laid
upon
roderick
s
shoulder
he
turned
staring
pale
and
angry
christina
rose
pale
and
staring
too
but
beautiful
in
her
wonder
and
alarm
my
dear
roderick
said
rowland
i
am
only
preventing
you
from
doing
a
very
foolish
thing
that
s
an
exploit
for
spiders
not
for
young
sculptors
of
roderick
wiped
his
forehead
looked
back
at
the
wall
and
then
closed
his
eyes
as
if
with
a
spasm
of
retarded
dizziness
i
won
t
resist
you
he
said
but
i
have
made
you
obey
he
added
turning
to
christina
am
i
weak
now
she
had
recovered
her
composure
she
looked
straight
past
him
and
addressed
rowland
be
so
good
as
to
show
me
the
way
out
of
this
horrible
place
he
helped
her
back
into
the
corridor
roderick
followed
after
a
short
interval
of
course
as
they
were
descending
the
steps
came
questions
for
rowland
to
answer
and
more
or
less
surprise
where
had
he
come
from
how
happened
he
to
have
appeared
at
just
that
moment
rowland
answered
that
he
had
been
rambling
overhead
and
that
looking
out
of
an
aperture
he
had
seen
a
gentleman
preparing
to
undertake
a
preposterous
gymnastic
feat
and
a
lady
swooning
away
in
consequence
interference
seemed
justifiable
and
he
had
made
it
as
prompt
as
possible
roderick
was
far
from
hanging
his
head
like
a
man
who
has
been
caught
in
the
perpetration
of
an
extravagant
folly
but
if
he
held
it
more
erect
than
usual
rowland
believed
that
this
was
much
less
because
he
had
made
a
show
of
personal
daring
than
because
he
had
triumphantly
proved
to
christina
that
like
a
certain
person
she
had
dreamed
of
he
too
could
speak
the
language
of
decision
christina
descended
to
the
arena
in
silence
apparently
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
she
betrayed
no
sense
of
the
privacy
of
her
interview
with
roderick
needing
an
explanation
rowland
had
seen
stranger
things
in
new
york
the
only
evidence
of
her
recent
agitation
was
that
on
being
joined
by
her
maid
she
declared
that
she
was
unable
to
walk
home
she
must
have
a
carriage
a
fiacre
was
found
resting
in
the
shadow
of
the
arch
of
constantine
and
rowland
suspected
that
after
she
had
got
into
it
she
disburdened
herself
under
her
veil
of
a
few
natural
tears
rowland
had
played
eavesdropper
to
so
good
a
purpose
that
he
might
justly
have
omitted
the
ceremony
of
denouncing
himself
to
roderick
he
preferred
however
to
let
him
know
that
he
had
overheard
a
portion
of
his
talk
with
christina
of
course
it
seems
to
you
roderick
said
a
proof
that
i
am
utterly
miss
light
seemed
to
me
to
know
very
well
how
far
she
could
go
rowland
answered
she
was
twisting
you
round
her
finger
i
don
t
think
she
exactly
meant
to
defy
you
but
your
crazy
pursuit
of
that
flower
was
a
proof
that
she
could
go
all
lengths
in
the
way
of
making
a
fool
of
yes
said
roderick
meditatively
she
is
making
a
fool
of
and
what
do
you
expect
to
come
of
it
nothing
good
and
roderick
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
as
if
he
had
announced
the
most
colorless
fact
in
the
world
and
in
the
light
of
your
late
interview
what
do
you
make
of
your
young
lady
if
i
could
tell
you
that
it
would
be
plain
sailing
but
she
ll
not
tell
me
again
i
am
weak
are
you
very
sure
you
are
not
weak
i
may
be
but
she
shall
never
know
rowland
said
no
more
until
they
reached
the
corso
when
he
asked
his
companion
whether
he
was
going
to
his
studio
roderick
started
out
of
a
reverie
and
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
oh
no
i
can
t
settle
down
to
work
after
such
a
scene
as
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
breaking
my
neck
then
but
i
feel
all
in
a
tremor
now
i
will
go
i
will
go
and
sit
in
the
sun
on
the
pincio
promise
me
this
first
said
rowland
very
solemnly
that
the
next
time
you
meet
miss
light
it
shall
be
on
the
earth
and
not
in
the
since
his
return
from
frascati
roderick
had
been
working
doggedly
at
the
statue
ordered
by
leavenworth
to
rowland
s
eye
he
had
made
a
very
fair
beginning
but
he
had
himself
insisted
from
the
first
that
he
liked
neither
his
subject
nor
his
patron
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
any
warmth
of
interest
in
a
work
which
was
to
be
incorporated
into
the
ponderous
personality
of
leavenworth
it
was
all
against
the
grain
he
wrought
without
love
nevertheless
after
a
fashion
he
wrought
and
the
figure
grew
beneath
his
hands
miss
blanchard
s
friend
was
ordering
works
of
art
on
every
side
and
his
purveyors
were
in
many
cases
persons
whom
roderick
declared
it
was
infamy
to
be
paired
with
there
had
been
grand
tailors
he
said
who
declined
to
make
you
a
coat
unless
you
got
the
hat
you
were
to
wear
with
it
from
an
artist
of
their
own
choosing
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
an
equal
right
to
exact
that
his
statue
should
not
form
part
of
the
same
system
of
ornament
as
the
pearl
of
perugia
a
picture
by
an
american
confrere
who
had
in
leavenworth
s
opinion
a
prodigious
eye
for
color
as
a
customer
leavenworth
used
to
drop
into
roderick
s
studio
to
see
how
things
were
getting
on
and
give
a
friendly
hint
or
so
he
would
seat
himself
squarely
plant
his
cane
between
his
legs
which
he
held
very
much
apart
rest
his
large
white
hands
on
the
head
and
enunciate
the
principles
of
spiritual
art
as
he
hoisted
them
one
by
one
as
you
might
say
out
of
the
depths
of
his
moral
consciousness
his
benignant
and
imperturbable
pomposity
gave
roderick
the
sense
of
suffocating
beneath
a
large
fluffy
bolster
and
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
that
the
good
gentleman
s
placid
vanity
had
an
integument
whose
toughness
no
sarcastic
shaft
could
pierce
roderick
admitted
that
in
thinking
over
the
tribulations
of
struggling
genius
the
danger
of
dying
of
had
never
occurred
to
him
the
deterring
effect
of
the
episode
of
the
coliseum
was
apparently
of
long
continuance
if
roderick
s
nerves
had
been
shaken
his
hand
needed
time
to
recover
its
steadiness
he
cultivated
composure
upon
principles
of
his
own
by
frequenting
entertainments
from
which
he
returned
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
lapsing
into
habits
which
might
fairly
be
called
irregular
he
had
hitherto
made
few
friends
among
the
artistic
fraternity
chiefly
because
he
had
taken
no
trouble
about
it
and
there
was
in
his
demeanor
an
elastic
independence
of
the
favor
of
his
which
made
social
advances
on
his
own
part
peculiarly
necessary
rowland
had
told
him
more
than
once
that
he
ought
to
fraternize
a
trifle
more
with
the
other
artists
and
he
had
always
answered
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
objection
to
fraternizing
let
them
come
but
they
came
on
rare
occasions
and
roderick
was
not
punctilious
about
returning
their
visits
he
declared
there
was
not
one
of
them
whose
works
gave
him
the
smallest
desire
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
insides
of
their
heads
for
gloriani
he
professed
a
superb
contempt
and
having
been
once
to
look
at
his
wares
never
crossed
his
threshold
again
the
only
one
of
the
fraternity
for
whom
by
his
own
admission
he
cared
a
straw
was
little
singleton
but
he
expressed
his
regard
only
in
a
kind
of
sublime
hilarity
whenever
he
encountered
this
humble
genius
and
quite
forgot
his
existence
in
the
intervals
he
had
never
been
to
see
him
but
singleton
edged
his
way
from
time
to
time
timidly
into
roderick
s
studio
and
agreed
with
characteristic
modesty
that
brilliant
fellows
like
the
sculptor
might
consent
to
receive
homage
but
could
hardly
be
expected
to
render
it
roderick
never
exactly
accepted
homage
and
apparently
did
not
quite
observe
whether
poor
singleton
spoke
in
admiration
or
in
blame
roderick
s
taste
as
to
companions
was
singularly
capricious
there
were
very
good
fellows
who
were
disposed
to
cultivate
him
who
bored
him
to
death
and
there
were
others
in
whom
even
rowland
s
was
unable
to
discover
a
pretext
for
tolerance
in
whom
he
appeared
to
find
the
highest
social
qualities
he
used
to
give
the
most
fantastic
reasons
for
his
likes
and
dislikes
he
would
declare
he
could
n
t
speak
a
civil
word
to
a
man
who
brushed
his
hair
in
a
certain
fashion
and
he
would
explain
his
unaccountable
fancy
for
an
individual
of
imperceptible
merit
by
telling
you
that
he
had
an
ancestor
who
in
the
thirteenth
century
had
walled
up
his
wife
alive
i
like
to
talk
to
a
man
whose
ancestor
has
walled
up
his
wife
alive
he
would
say
you
may
not
see
the
fun
of
it
and
think
poor
p
is
a
very
dull
fellow
it
s
very
possible
i
don
t
ask
you
to
admire
him
but
for
reasons
of
my
own
i
like
to
have
him
about
the
old
fellow
left
her
for
three
days
with
her
face
uncovered
and
placed
a
long
mirror
opposite
to
her
so
that
she
could
see
as
he
said
if
her
gown
was
a
fit
his
relish
for
an
odd
flavor
in
his
friends
had
led
him
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
number
of
people
outside
of
rowland
s
circle
and
he
made
no
secret
of
their
being
very
queer
fish
he
formed
an
intimacy
among
others
with
a
crazy
fellow
who
had
come
to
rome
as
an
emissary
of
one
of
the
central
american
republics
to
drive
some
ecclesiastical
bargain
with
the
papal
government
the
pope
had
given
him
the
cold
shoulder
but
since
he
had
not
prospered
as
a
diplomatist
he
had
sought
compensation
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
his
great
flamboyant
curricle
and
negro
lackeys
were
for
several
weeks
one
of
the
striking
ornaments
of
the
pincian
he
spoke
a
queer
jargon
of
italian
spanish
french
and
english
humorously
relieved
with
scraps
of
ecclesiastical
latin
and
to
those
who
inquired
of
roderick
what
he
found
to
interest
him
in
such
a
fantastic
jackanapes
the
latter
would
reply
looking
at
his
interlocutor
with
his
lucid
blue
eyes
that
it
was
worth
any
sacrifice
to
hear
him
talk
nonsense
the
two
had
gone
together
one
night
to
a
ball
given
by
a
lady
of
some
renown
in
the
spanish
colony
and
very
late
on
his
way
home
roderick
came
up
to
rowland
s
rooms
in
whose
windows
he
had
seen
a
light
rowland
was
going
to
bed
but
roderick
flung
himself
into
an
armchair
and
chattered
for
an
hour
the
friends
of
the
costa
rican
envoy
were
as
amusing
as
himself
and
in
very
much
the
same
line
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
worn
a
yellow
satin
dress
and
gold
heels
to
her
slippers
and
at
the
close
of
the
entertainment
had
sent
for
a
pair
of
castanets
tucked
up
her
petticoats
and
danced
a
fandango
while
the
gentlemen
sat
on
the
floor
it
was
awfully
low
roderick
said
all
of
a
sudden
i
perceived
it
and
bolted
nothing
of
that
kind
ever
amuses
me
to
the
end
before
it
s
half
over
it
bores
me
to
death
it
makes
me
sick
hang
it
why
can
t
a
poor
fellow
enjoy
things
in
peace
my
illusions
are
all
they
won
t
carry
me
twenty
paces
i
can
t
laugh
and
forget
my
laugh
dies
away
before
it
begins
your
friend
stendhal
writes
on
his
i
never
got
farther
that
he
has
seen
too
early
in
life
la
beaute
parfaite
i
don
t
know
how
early
he
saw
it
i
saw
it
before
i
was
born
in
another
state
of
being
i
can
t
describe
it
positively
i
can
only
say
i
don
t
find
it
anywhere
now
not
at
the
bottom
of
champagne
glasses
not
strange
as
it
may
seem
in
that
extra
or
so
of
shoulder
that
some
women
have
their
cut
to
expose
i
don
t
find
it
at
merry
where
half
a
dozen
ugly
men
with
pomatumed
heads
are
rapidly
growing
uglier
still
with
heat
and
wine
not
when
i
come
away
and
walk
through
these
squalid
black
streets
and
go
out
into
the
forum
and
see
a
few
old
battered
stone
posts
standing
there
like
gnawed
bones
stuck
into
the
earth
everything
is
mean
and
dusky
and
shabby
and
the
men
and
women
who
make
up
this
brilliant
society
are
the
meanest
and
shabbiest
of
all
they
have
no
real
spontaneity
they
are
all
cowards
and
popinjays
they
have
no
more
dignity
than
so
many
grasshoppers
nothing
is
good
but
one
and
he
jumped
up
and
stood
looking
at
one
of
his
statues
which
shone
vaguely
across
the
room
in
the
dim
lamplight
yes
do
tell
us
said
rowland
what
to
hold
on
by
those
things
of
mine
were
tolerably
good
he
answered
but
my
idea
was
better
and
that
s
what
i
mean
rowland
said
nothing
he
was
willing
to
wait
for
roderick
to
complete
the
circle
of
his
metamorphoses
but
he
had
no
desire
to
officiate
as
chorus
to
the
play
if
roderick
chose
to
fish
in
troubled
waters
he
must
land
his
prizes
himself
you
think
i
m
an
impudent
humbug
the
latter
said
at
last
coming
up
to
moralize
at
this
hour
of
the
night
you
think
i
want
to
throw
dust
into
your
eyes
to
put
you
off
the
scent
that
s
your
eminently
rational
view
of
the
excuse
me
from
taking
any
view
at
all
said
rowland
you
have
given
me
up
then
no
i
have
merely
suspended
judgment
i
am
you
have
ceased
then
positively
to
believe
in
me
rowland
made
an
angry
gesture
oh
cruel
boy
when
you
have
hit
your
mark
and
made
people
care
for
you
you
should
n
t
twist
your
weapon
about
at
that
rate
in
their
vitals
allow
me
to
say
i
am
sleepy
good
night
some
days
afterward
it
happened
that
rowland
on
a
long
afternoon
ramble
took
his
way
through
one
of
the
quiet
corners
of
the
trastevere
he
was
particularly
fond
of
this
part
of
rome
though
he
could
hardly
have
expressed
the
charm
he
found
in
it
as
you
pass
away
from
the
dusky
swarming
purlieus
of
the
ghetto
you
emerge
into
a
region
of
empty
soundless
lanes
and
alleys
where
the
shabby
houses
seem
mouldering
away
in
disuse
and
yet
your
footstep
brings
figures
of
startling
roman
type
to
the
doorways
there
are
few
monuments
here
but
no
part
of
rome
seemed
more
historic
in
the
sense
of
being
weighted
with
a
crushing
past
blighted
with
the
melancholy
of
things
that
had
had
their
day
when
the
yellow
afternoon
sunshine
slept
on
the
sallow
battered
walls
and
lengthened
the
shadows
in
the
grassy
courtyards
of
small
closed
churches
the
place
acquired
a
strange
fascination
the
church
of
saint
cecilia
has
one
of
these
sunny
courts
the
edifice
seems
abandoned
to
silence
and
the
charity
of
chance
devotion
rowland
never
passed
it
without
going
in
and
he
was
generally
the
only
visitor
he
entered
it
now
but
found
that
two
persons
had
preceded
him
both
were
women
one
was
at
her
prayers
at
one
of
the
side
altars
the
other
was
seated
against
a
column
at
the
upper
end
of
the
nave
rowland
walked
to
the
altar
and
paid
in
a
momentary
glance
at
the
clever
statue
of
the
saint
in
death
in
the
niche
beneath
it
the
usual
tribute
to
the
charm
of
polished
ingenuity
as
he
turned
away
he
looked
at
the
person
seated
and
recognized
christina
light
seeing
that
she
perceived
him
he
advanced
to
speak
to
her
she
was
sitting
in
a
listless
attitude
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
she
seemed
to
be
tired
she
was
dressed
simply
as
if
for
walking
and
escaping
observation
when
he
had
greeted
her
he
glanced
back
at
her
companion
and
recognized
the
faithful
assunta
christina
smiled
are
you
looking
for
hudson
he
is
not
here
i
am
happy
to
but
you
he
asked
this
is
a
strange
place
to
find
not
at
all
people
call
me
a
strange
girl
and
i
might
as
well
have
the
comfort
of
it
i
came
to
take
a
walk
that
by
the
way
is
part
of
my
strangeness
i
can
t
loll
all
the
morning
on
a
sofa
and
all
the
afternoon
in
a
carriage
i
get
horribly
restless
i
must
move
i
must
do
something
and
see
something
mamma
suggests
a
cup
of
tea
meanwhile
i
put
on
an
old
dress
and
half
a
dozen
veils
i
take
assunta
under
my
arm
and
we
start
on
a
pedestrian
tour
it
s
a
bore
that
i
can
t
take
the
poodle
but
he
attracts
attention
we
trudge
about
everywhere
there
is
nothing
i
like
so
much
i
hope
you
will
congratulate
me
on
the
simplicity
of
my
i
congratulate
you
on
your
wisdom
to
live
in
rome
and
not
to
walk
would
i
think
be
poor
pleasure
but
you
are
terribly
far
from
home
and
i
am
afraid
you
are
a
little
enough
to
sit
here
a
might
i
offer
you
my
company
while
you
rest
if
you
will
promise
to
amuse
me
i
am
in
dismal
rowland
said
he
would
do
what
he
could
and
brought
a
chair
and
placed
it
near
her
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
he
disapproved
of
her
he
mistrusted
her
and
yet
he
felt
it
a
kind
of
privilege
to
watch
her
and
he
found
a
peculiar
excitement
in
talking
to
her
the
background
of
her
nature
as
he
would
have
called
it
was
large
and
mysterious
and
it
emitted
strange
fantastic
gleams
and
flashes
watching
for
these
rather
quickened
one
s
pulses
moreover
it
was
not
a
disadvantage
to
talk
to
a
girl
who
made
one
keep
guard
on
one
s
composure
it
diminished
one
s
chronic
liability
to
utter
something
less
than
revised
wisdom
assunta
had
risen
from
her
prayers
and
as
he
took
his
place
was
coming
back
to
her
mistress
but
christina
motioned
her
away
no
no
while
you
are
about
it
say
a
few
dozen
more
she
said
pray
for
me
she
added
in
english
pray
i
say
nothing
silly
she
has
been
at
it
half
an
hour
i
envy
her
capacity
have
you
never
felt
in
any
degree
rowland
asked
the
fascination
of
catholicism
yes
i
have
been
through
that
too
there
was
a
time
when
i
wanted
immensely
to
be
a
nun
it
was
not
a
laughing
matter
it
was
when
i
was
about
sixteen
years
old
i
read
the
imitation
and
the
life
of
saint
catherine
i
fully
believed
in
the
miracles
of
the
saints
and
i
was
dying
to
have
one
of
my
own
the
least
little
accident
that
could
have
been
twisted
into
a
miracle
would
have
carried
me
straight
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
i
had
the
real
religious
passion
it
has
passed
away
and
as
i
sat
here
just
now
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
it
rowland
had
already
been
sensible
of
something
in
this
young
lady
s
tone
which
he
would
have
called
a
want
of
veracity
and
this
epitome
of
her
religious
experience
failed
to
strike
him
as
an
absolute
statement
of
fact
but
the
trait
was
not
disagreeable
for
she
herself
was
evidently
the
foremost
dupe
of
her
inventions
she
had
a
fictitious
history
in
which
she
believed
much
more
fondly
than
in
her
real
one
and
an
infinite
capacity
for
extemporized
reminiscence
adapted
to
the
mood
of
the
hour
she
liked
to
idealize
herself
to
take
interesting
and
picturesque
attitudes
to
her
own
imagination
and
the
vivacity
and
spontaneity
of
her
character
gave
her
really
a
in
experience
so
that
the
flowers
of
fiction
which
blossomed
in
her
talk
were
not
so
much
perversions
as
sympathetic
exaggerations
of
fact
and
rowland
felt
that
whatever
she
said
of
herself
might
have
been
under
the
imagined
circumstances
impulse
was
there
audacity
the
restless
questioning
temperament
i
am
afraid
i
am
sadly
prosaic
he
said
for
in
these
many
months
now
that
i
have
been
in
rome
i
have
never
ceased
for
a
moment
to
look
at
catholicism
simply
from
the
outside
i
don
t
see
an
opening
as
big
as
your
where
i
could
creep
into
it
what
do
you
believe
asked
christina
looking
at
him
are
you
religious
i
believe
in
christina
let
her
beautiful
eyes
wander
a
while
and
then
gave
a
little
sigh
you
are
much
to
be
envied
you
i
imagine
in
that
line
have
nothing
to
envy
yes
i
have
rest
you
are
too
young
to
say
i
am
not
young
i
have
never
been
young
my
mother
took
care
of
that
i
was
a
little
wrinkled
old
woman
at
i
am
afraid
said
rowland
in
a
moment
that
you
are
fond
of
painting
yourself
in
dark
she
looked
at
him
a
while
in
silence
do
you
wish
she
demanded
at
last
to
win
my
eternal
gratitude
prove
to
me
that
i
am
better
than
i
i
should
have
first
to
know
what
you
really
she
shook
her
head
it
would
n
t
do
you
would
be
horrified
to
learn
even
the
things
i
imagine
about
myself
and
shocked
at
the
knowledge
of
evil
displayed
in
my
very
well
then
said
rowland
i
will
ask
no
questions
but
at
a
venture
i
promise
you
to
catch
you
some
day
in
the
act
of
doing
something
very
can
it
be
can
it
be
she
asked
that
you
too
are
trying
to
flatter
me
i
thought
you
and
i
had
fallen
from
the
first
into
rather
a
oh
i
have
not
abandoned
it
said
rowland
and
he
determined
since
he
had
the
credit
of
homely
directness
to
push
his
advantage
farther
the
opportunity
seemed
excellent
but
while
he
was
hesitating
as
to
just
how
to
begin
the
young
girl
said
bending
forward
and
clasping
her
hands
in
her
lap
please
tell
me
about
your
tell
you
about
it
i
can
t
said
rowland
with
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
she
flushed
a
little
is
it
such
a
mighty
mystery
it
can
not
be
put
into
words
nor
communicated
to
my
base
ears
it
is
simply
a
sentiment
that
makes
part
of
my
life
and
i
can
t
detach
myself
from
it
sufficiently
to
talk
about
religion
it
seems
to
me
should
be
eloquent
and
aggressive
it
should
wish
to
make
converts
to
persuade
and
illumine
to
sway
all
hearts
one
s
religion
takes
the
color
of
one
s
general
disposition
i
am
not
aggressive
and
certainly
i
am
not
beware
then
of
finding
yourself
confronted
with
doubt
and
despair
i
am
sure
that
doubt
at
times
and
the
bitterness
that
comes
of
it
can
be
terribly
eloquent
to
tell
the
truth
my
lonely
musings
before
you
came
in
were
eloquent
enough
in
their
way
what
do
you
know
of
anything
but
this
strange
terrible
world
that
surrounds
you
how
do
you
know
that
your
faith
is
not
a
mere
crazy
castle
in
the
air
one
of
those
castles
that
we
are
called
fools
for
building
when
we
lodge
them
in
this
life
i
don
t
know
it
any
more
than
any
one
knows
the
contrary
but
one
s
religion
is
extremely
ingenious
in
doing
without
in
such
a
world
as
this
it
certainly
needs
to
be
rowland
smiled
what
is
your
particular
quarrel
with
this
world
it
s
a
general
quarrel
nothing
is
true
or
fixed
or
permanent
we
all
seem
to
be
playing
with
shadows
more
or
less
grotesque
it
all
comes
over
me
here
so
dismally
the
very
atmosphere
of
this
cold
deserted
church
seems
to
mock
at
one
s
longing
to
believe
in
something
who
cares
for
it
now
who
comes
to
it
who
takes
it
seriously
poor
stupid
assunta
there
gives
in
her
adhesion
in
a
jargon
she
does
n
t
understand
and
you
and
i
proper
passionless
tourists
come
lounging
in
to
rest
from
a
walk
and
yet
the
catholic
church
was
once
the
proudest
institution
in
the
world
and
had
quite
its
own
way
with
men
s
souls
when
such
a
mighty
structure
as
that
turns
out
to
have
a
flaw
what
faith
is
one
to
put
in
one
s
poor
little
views
and
philosophies
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
what
is
one
really
to
care
for
what
is
the
proper
rule
of
life
i
am
tired
of
trying
to
discover
and
i
suspect
it
s
not
worth
the
trouble
live
as
most
amuses
you
your
perplexities
are
so
terribly
comprehensive
said
rowland
smiling
that
one
hardly
knows
where
to
meet
them
i
don
t
care
much
for
anything
you
can
say
because
it
s
sure
to
be
you
are
not
in
the
least
contented
how
do
you
know
that
oh
i
am
an
observer
no
one
is
absolutely
contented
i
suppose
but
i
assure
you
i
complain
of
so
much
the
worse
for
your
honesty
to
begin
with
you
are
in
you
would
not
have
me
complain
of
that
and
it
does
n
t
go
well
there
are
grievous
obstacles
so
much
i
know
you
need
n
t
protest
i
ask
no
questions
you
will
tell
no
one
me
least
of
all
why
does
one
never
see
you
why
if
i
came
to
see
you
said
rowland
deliberating
it
would
n
t
be
it
could
n
t
be
for
a
trivial
reason
because
i
had
not
been
in
a
month
because
i
was
passing
because
i
admire
you
it
would
be
because
i
should
have
something
very
particular
to
say
i
have
not
come
because
i
have
been
slow
in
making
up
my
mind
to
say
you
are
simply
cruel
something
particular
in
this
ocean
of
inanities
in
common
charity
speak
i
doubt
whether
you
will
like
oh
i
hope
to
heaven
it
s
not
a
compliment
it
may
be
called
a
compliment
to
your
reasonableness
you
perhaps
remember
that
i
gave
you
a
hint
of
it
the
other
day
at
has
it
been
hanging
fire
all
this
time
explode
i
promise
not
to
stop
my
it
relates
to
my
friend
and
rowland
paused
she
was
looking
at
him
expectantly
her
face
gave
no
sign
i
am
rather
disturbed
in
mind
about
him
he
seems
to
me
at
times
to
be
in
an
unpromising
he
paused
again
but
christina
said
nothing
the
case
is
simply
this
he
went
on
it
was
by
my
advice
he
renounced
his
career
at
home
and
embraced
his
present
one
i
made
him
burn
his
ships
i
brought
him
to
rome
i
launched
him
in
the
world
and
i
stand
surety
in
a
measure
to
to
his
mother
for
his
prosperity
it
is
not
such
smooth
sailing
as
it
might
be
and
i
am
inclined
to
put
up
prayers
for
fair
winds
if
he
is
to
succeed
he
must
work
quietly
devotedly
it
is
not
news
to
you
i
imagine
that
hudson
is
a
great
admirer
of
christina
remained
silent
she
turned
away
her
eyes
with
an
air
not
of
confusion
but
of
deep
deliberation
surprising
frankness
had
as
a
general
thing
struck
rowland
as
the
of
her
character
but
she
had
more
than
once
given
him
a
suggestion
of
an
unfathomable
power
of
calculation
and
her
silence
now
had
something
which
it
is
hardly
extravagant
to
call
portentous
he
had
of
course
asked
himself
how
far
it
was
questionable
taste
to
inform
an
unprotected
girl
for
the
needs
of
a
cause
that
another
man
admired
her
the
thing
superficially
had
an
uncomfortable
analogy
with
the
shrewdness
that
uses
a
cat
s
paw
and
lets
it
risk
being
singed
but
he
decided
that
even
rigid
discretion
is
not
bound
to
take
a
young
lady
at
more
than
her
own
valuation
and
christina
presently
reassured
him
as
to
the
limits
of
her
susceptibility
mr
hudson
is
in
love
with
me
she
said
rowland
flinched
a
trifle
then
am
i
he
asked
from
this
point
of
view
of
mine
to
be
glad
or
sorry
i
don
t
understand
why
is
hudson
to
be
happy
or
unhappy
she
hesitated
a
moment
you
wish
him
to
be
great
in
his
profession
and
for
that
you
consider
that
he
must
be
happy
in
his
life
decidedly
i
don
t
say
it
s
a
general
rule
but
i
think
it
is
a
rule
for
so
that
if
he
were
very
happy
he
would
become
very
great
he
would
at
least
do
himself
and
by
that
you
mean
a
great
deal
a
great
christina
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
rested
her
eyes
on
the
cracked
and
polished
slabs
of
the
pavement
at
last
looking
up
you
have
not
forgotten
i
suppose
that
you
told
me
he
was
engaged
by
no
he
is
still
engaged
then
to
the
best
of
my
and
yet
you
desire
that
as
you
say
he
should
be
made
happy
by
something
i
can
do
for
him
what
i
desire
is
this
that
your
great
influence
with
him
should
be
exerted
for
his
good
that
it
should
help
him
and
not
retard
him
understand
me
you
probably
know
that
your
lovers
have
rather
a
restless
time
of
it
i
can
answer
for
two
of
them
you
don
t
know
your
own
mind
very
well
i
imagine
and
you
like
being
admired
rather
at
the
expense
of
the
admirer
since
we
are
really
being
frank
i
wonder
whether
i
might
not
say
the
great
you
need
n
t
i
know
it
i
am
a
horrible
no
not
a
horrible
one
since
i
am
making
an
appeal
to
your
generosity
i
am
pretty
sure
you
can
not
imagine
yourself
marrying
my
there
s
nothing
i
can
not
imagine
that
is
my
rowland
s
brow
contracted
impatiently
i
can
not
imagine
it
then
he
affirmed
christina
flushed
faintly
then
very
gently
i
am
not
so
bad
as
you
think
she
said
it
is
not
a
question
of
badness
it
is
a
question
of
whether
circumstances
don
t
make
the
thing
an
extreme
worse
and
worse
i
can
be
bullied
then
or
bribed
you
are
not
so
candid
said
rowland
as
you
pretend
to
be
my
feeling
is
this
hudson
as
i
understand
him
does
not
need
as
an
artist
the
stimulus
of
strong
emotion
of
passion
he
s
better
without
it
he
s
emotional
and
passionate
enough
when
he
s
left
to
himself
the
sooner
passion
is
at
rest
therefore
the
sooner
he
will
settle
down
to
work
and
the
fewer
emotions
he
has
that
are
mere
emotions
and
nothing
more
the
better
for
him
if
you
cared
for
him
enough
to
marry
him
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
i
would
never
venture
to
interfere
but
i
strongly
suspect
you
don
t
and
therefore
i
would
suggest
most
respectfully
that
you
should
let
him
and
if
i
let
him
alone
as
you
say
all
will
be
well
with
him
for
ever
more
not
immediately
and
not
absolutely
but
things
will
be
easier
he
will
be
better
able
to
concentrate
what
is
he
doing
now
wherein
does
he
dissatisfy
you
i
can
hardly
say
he
s
like
a
watch
that
s
running
down
he
is
moody
desultory
idle
irregular
heavens
what
a
list
and
it
s
all
poor
me
no
not
all
but
you
are
a
part
of
it
and
i
turn
to
you
because
you
are
a
more
tangible
sensible
responsible
cause
than
the
christina
raised
her
hand
to
her
eyes
and
bent
her
head
thoughtfully
rowland
was
puzzled
to
measure
the
effect
of
his
venture
she
rather
surprised
him
by
her
gentleness
at
last
without
moving
if
i
were
to
marry
him
she
asked
what
would
have
become
of
his
fiancee
i
am
bound
to
suppose
that
she
would
be
extremely
christina
said
nothing
more
and
rowland
to
let
her
make
her
reflections
left
his
place
and
strolled
away
poor
assunta
sitting
patiently
on
a
stone
bench
and
unprovided
on
this
occasion
with
military
consolation
gave
him
a
bright
frank
smile
which
might
have
been
construed
as
an
expression
of
regret
for
herself
and
of
sympathy
for
her
mistress
rowland
presently
seated
himself
again
near
christina
what
do
you
think
she
asked
looking
at
him
of
your
friend
s
infidelity
i
don
t
like
was
he
very
much
in
love
with
her
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
you
may
is
she
rich
no
she
is
is
she
very
much
in
love
with
him
i
know
her
too
little
to
she
paused
again
and
then
resumed
you
have
settled
in
your
mind
then
that
i
will
never
seriously
listen
to
him
i
think
it
unlikely
until
the
contrary
is
how
shall
it
be
proved
how
do
you
know
what
passes
between
us
i
can
judge
of
course
but
from
appearance
but
like
you
i
am
an
observer
hudson
has
not
at
all
the
air
of
a
prosperous
if
he
is
depressed
there
is
a
reason
he
has
a
bad
conscience
one
must
hope
so
at
least
on
the
other
hand
simply
as
a
friend
she
continued
gently
you
think
i
can
do
him
no
good
the
humility
of
her
tone
combined
with
her
beauty
as
she
made
this
remark
was
inexpressibly
touching
and
rowland
had
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
being
put
at
a
disadvantage
there
are
doubtless
many
good
things
you
might
do
if
you
had
proper
opportunity
he
said
but
you
seem
to
be
sailing
with
a
current
which
leaves
you
little
leisure
for
quiet
benevolence
you
live
in
the
whirl
and
hurry
of
a
world
into
which
a
poor
artist
can
hardly
find
it
to
his
advantage
to
follow
in
plain
english
i
am
hopelessly
frivolous
you
put
it
very
i
won
t
hesitate
to
say
all
my
thought
said
rowland
for
better
or
worse
you
seem
to
me
to
belong
both
by
character
and
by
circumstance
to
what
is
called
the
world
the
great
world
you
are
made
to
ornament
it
magnificently
you
are
not
made
to
be
an
artist
s
i
see
but
even
from
your
point
of
view
that
would
depend
upon
the
artist
extraordinary
talent
might
make
him
a
member
of
the
great
world
rowland
smiled
that
is
very
if
as
it
is
christina
continued
in
a
moment
you
take
a
low
view
of
me
no
you
need
n
t
protest
i
wonder
what
you
would
think
if
you
knew
certain
what
things
do
you
mean
well
for
example
how
i
was
brought
up
i
have
had
a
horrible
education
there
must
be
some
good
in
me
since
i
have
perceived
it
since
i
have
turned
and
judged
my
my
dear
miss
light
rowland
murmured
she
gave
a
little
quick
laugh
you
don
t
want
to
hear
you
don
t
want
to
have
to
think
about
that
have
i
a
right
to
you
need
n
t
justify
she
turned
upon
him
a
moment
the
quickened
light
of
her
beautiful
eyes
then
fell
to
musing
again
is
there
not
some
novel
or
some
play
she
asked
at
last
in
which
some
beautiful
wicked
woman
who
has
ensnared
a
young
man
sees
his
father
come
to
her
and
beg
her
to
let
him
go
very
likely
said
rowland
i
hope
she
i
forget
but
tell
me
she
continued
shall
you
consider
admitting
your
proposition
that
in
ceasing
to
flirt
with
hudson
so
that
he
may
go
about
his
business
i
do
something
magnanimous
heroic
sublime
something
with
a
fine
name
like
that
rowland
elated
with
the
prospect
of
gaining
his
point
was
about
to
reply
that
she
would
deserve
the
finest
name
in
the
world
but
he
instantly
suspected
that
this
tone
would
not
please
her
and
besides
it
would
not
express
his
meaning
you
do
something
i
shall
greatly
respect
he
contented
himself
with
saying
she
made
no
answer
and
in
a
moment
she
beckoned
to
her
maid
what
have
i
to
do
she
asked
assunta
meditated
eh
it
s
a
very
busy
day
fortunately
i
have
a
better
memory
than
the
signorina
she
said
turning
to
rowland
she
began
to
count
on
her
fingers
we
have
to
go
to
the
pie
di
marmo
to
see
about
those
laces
that
were
sent
to
be
washed
you
said
also
that
you
wished
to
say
three
sharp
words
to
the
buonvicini
about
your
pink
dress
you
want
some
for
and
you
won
t
get
them
for
nothing
you
dine
at
the
austrian
embassy
and
that
frenchman
is
to
powder
your
hair
you
re
to
come
home
in
time
to
receive
for
the
signora
gives
a
dance
and
so
away
away
till
morning
ah
yes
the
christina
murmured
caressingly
i
must
have
a
quantity
at
least
a
hundred
nothing
but
buds
eh
you
must
sew
them
in
a
kind
of
immense
apron
down
the
front
of
my
dress
packed
tight
together
eh
it
will
be
delightfully
barbarous
and
then
twenty
more
or
so
for
my
hair
they
go
very
well
with
powder
don
t
you
think
so
and
she
turned
to
rowland
i
am
going
en
going
where
to
the
spanish
embassy
or
whatever
it
all
down
the
front
signorina
dio
buono
you
must
give
me
time
assunta
cried
yes
we
ll
go
and
she
left
her
place
she
walked
slowly
to
the
door
of
the
church
looking
at
the
pavement
and
rowland
could
not
guess
whether
she
was
thinking
of
her
apron
of
or
of
her
opportunity
for
moral
sublimity
before
reaching
the
door
she
turned
away
and
stood
gazing
at
an
old
picture
indistinguishable
with
blackness
over
an
altar
at
last
they
passed
out
into
the
court
glancing
at
her
in
the
open
air
rowland
was
startled
he
imagined
he
saw
the
traces
of
hastily
suppressed
tears
they
had
lost
time
she
said
and
they
must
hurry
she
sent
assunta
to
look
for
a
fiacre
she
remained
silent
a
while
scratching
the
ground
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
and
then
at
last
looking
up
she
thanked
rowland
for
his
confidence
in
her
it
s
really
very
comfortable
to
be
asked
to
be
expected
to
do
something
good
after
all
the
horrid
things
one
has
been
used
to
doing
instructed
commanded
forced
to
do
i
ll
think
over
what
you
have
said
to
in
that
deserted
quarter
fiacres
are
rare
and
there
was
some
delay
in
assunta
s
procuring
one
christina
talked
of
the
church
of
the
picturesque
old
court
of
that
strange
decaying
corner
of
rome
rowland
was
perplexed
he
was
ill
at
ease
at
last
the
fiacre
arrived
but
she
waited
a
moment
longer
so
decidedly
she
suddenly
asked
i
can
only
harm
him
you
make
me
feel
very
brutal
said
rowland
and
he
is
such
a
fine
fellow
that
it
would
be
really
a
great
pity
eh
i
shall
praise
him
no
more
rowland
said
she
turned
away
quickly
but
she
lingered
still
do
you
remember
promising
me
soon
after
we
first
met
that
at
the
end
of
six
months
you
would
tell
me
definitely
what
you
thought
of
me
it
was
a
foolish
you
gave
it
bear
it
in
mind
i
will
think
of
what
you
have
said
to
me
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
it
rolled
away
rowland
stood
for
some
minutes
looking
after
it
and
then
went
his
way
with
a
sigh
if
this
expressed
general
mistrust
he
ought
three
days
afterward
to
have
been
reassured
he
received
by
the
post
a
note
containing
these
words
i
have
done
it
begin
and
respect
me
to
be
perfectly
satisfactory
indeed
the
note
required
a
commentary
he
called
that
evening
upon
roderick
and
found
one
in
the
information
offered
him
at
the
door
by
the
old
the
startling
information
that
the
signorino
had
gone
to
naples
chapter
viii
provocation
about
a
month
later
rowland
addressed
to
his
cousin
cecilia
a
letter
of
which
the
following
is
a
portion
so
much
for
myself
yet
i
tell
you
but
a
tithe
of
my
own
story
unless
i
let
you
know
how
matters
stand
with
poor
hudson
for
he
gives
me
more
to
think
about
just
now
than
anything
else
in
the
world
i
need
a
good
deal
of
courage
to
begin
this
chapter
you
warned
me
you
know
and
i
made
rather
light
of
your
warning
i
have
had
all
kinds
of
hopes
and
fears
but
hitherto
in
writing
to
you
i
have
resolutely
put
the
hopes
foremost
now
however
my
pride
has
forsaken
me
and
i
should
like
hugely
to
give
expression
to
a
little
comfortable
despair
i
should
like
to
say
my
dear
wise
woman
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
you
were
a
shrewd
observer
and
i
was
a
meddlesome
donkey
when
i
think
of
a
little
talk
we
had
about
the
salubrity
of
genius
i
feel
my
ears
tingle
if
this
is
salubrity
give
me
raging
disease
i
m
pestered
to
death
i
go
about
with
a
chronic
heartache
there
are
moments
when
i
could
shed
salt
tears
there
s
a
pretty
portrait
of
the
most
placid
of
men
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
or
rather
i
wish
you
could
make
me
i
don
t
understand
a
jot
it
s
a
hideous
mocking
mystery
i
give
it
up
i
don
t
in
the
least
give
it
up
you
know
i
m
incapable
of
giving
it
up
i
sit
holding
my
head
by
the
hour
racking
my
brain
wondering
what
under
heaven
is
to
be
done
you
told
me
at
northampton
that
i
took
the
thing
too
easily
you
would
tell
me
now
perhaps
that
i
take
it
too
hard
i
do
altogether
but
it
can
t
be
helped
without
flattering
myself
i
may
say
i
m
sympathetic
many
another
man
before
this
would
have
cast
his
perplexities
to
the
winds
and
declared
that
hudson
must
lie
on
his
bed
as
he
had
made
it
some
men
perhaps
would
even
say
that
i
am
making
a
mighty
ado
about
nothing
that
i
have
only
to
give
him
rope
and
he
will
tire
himself
out
but
he
tugs
at
his
rope
altogether
too
hard
for
me
to
hold
it
comfortably
i
certainly
never
pretended
the
thing
was
anything
else
than
an
experiment
i
promised
nothing
i
answered
for
nothing
i
only
said
the
case
was
hopeful
and
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
neglect
it
i
have
done
my
best
and
if
the
machine
is
running
down
i
have
a
right
to
stand
aside
and
let
it
scuttle
amen
amen
no
i
can
write
that
but
i
can
t
feel
it
i
can
t
be
just
i
can
only
be
generous
i
love
the
poor
fellow
and
i
can
t
give
him
up
as
for
understanding
him
that
s
another
matter
nowadays
i
don
t
believe
even
you
would
one
s
wits
are
sadly
pestered
over
here
i
assure
you
and
i
m
in
the
way
of
seeing
more
than
one
puzzling
specimen
of
human
nature
roderick
and
miss
light
between
them
have
n
t
i
already
told
you
about
miss
light
last
winter
everything
was
perfection
roderick
struck
out
bravely
did
really
great
things
and
proved
himself
as
i
supposed
thoroughly
solid
he
was
strong
he
was
i
felt
perfectly
secure
and
sang
private
paeans
of
joy
we
had
passed
at
a
bound
into
the
open
sea
and
left
danger
behind
but
in
the
summer
i
began
to
be
puzzled
though
i
succeeded
in
not
being
alarmed
when
we
came
back
to
rome
however
i
saw
that
the
tide
had
turned
and
that
we
were
close
upon
the
rocks
it
is
in
fact
another
case
of
ulysses
alongside
of
the
sirens
only
roderick
refuses
to
be
tied
to
the
mast
he
is
the
most
extraordinary
being
the
strangest
mixture
of
qualities
i
don
t
understand
so
much
force
going
with
so
much
weakness
such
a
brilliant
gift
being
subject
to
such
lapses
the
poor
fellow
is
incomplete
and
it
is
really
not
his
own
fault
nature
has
given
him
the
faculty
out
of
hand
and
bidden
him
be
hanged
with
it
i
never
knew
a
man
harder
to
advise
or
assist
if
he
is
not
in
the
mood
for
listening
i
suppose
there
is
some
key
or
other
to
his
character
but
i
try
in
vain
to
find
it
and
yet
i
can
t
believe
that
providence
is
so
cruel
as
to
have
turned
the
lock
and
thrown
the
key
away
he
perplexes
me
as
i
say
to
death
and
though
he
tires
out
my
patience
he
still
fascinates
me
sometimes
i
think
he
has
n
t
a
grain
of
conscience
and
sometimes
i
think
that
in
a
way
he
has
an
excess
he
takes
things
at
once
too
easily
and
too
hard
he
is
both
too
lax
and
too
tense
too
reckless
and
too
ambitious
too
cold
and
too
passionate
he
has
developed
faster
even
than
you
prophesied
and
for
good
and
evil
alike
he
takes
up
a
formidable
space
there
s
too
much
of
him
for
me
at
any
rate
yes
he
is
hard
there
is
no
mistake
about
that
he
s
inflexible
he
s
brittle
and
though
he
has
plenty
of
spirit
plenty
of
soul
he
has
n
t
what
i
call
a
heart
he
has
something
that
miss
garland
took
for
one
and
i
m
pretty
sure
she
s
a
judge
but
she
judged
on
scanty
evidence
he
has
something
that
christina
light
here
makes
believe
at
times
that
she
takes
for
one
but
she
is
no
judge
at
all
i
think
it
is
established
that
in
the
long
run
egotism
makes
a
failure
in
conduct
is
it
also
true
that
it
makes
a
failure
in
the
arts
roderick
s
standard
is
immensely
high
i
must
do
him
that
justice
he
will
do
nothing
beneath
it
and
while
he
is
waiting
for
inspiration
his
imagination
his
nerves
his
senses
must
have
something
to
amuse
them
this
is
a
highly
philosophical
way
of
saying
that
he
has
taken
to
dissipation
and
that
he
has
just
been
spending
a
month
at
naples
a
city
where
pleasure
is
actively
cultivated
in
very
bad
company
are
they
all
like
that
all
the
men
of
genius
there
are
a
great
many
artists
here
who
hammer
away
at
their
trade
with
exemplary
industry
in
fact
i
am
surprised
at
their
success
in
reducing
the
matter
to
a
steady
daily
grind
but
i
really
don
t
think
that
one
of
them
has
his
exquisite
quality
of
talent
it
is
in
the
matter
of
quantity
that
he
has
broken
down
the
bottle
won
t
pour
he
turns
it
upside
down
it
s
no
use
sometimes
he
declares
it
s
empty
that
he
has
done
all
he
was
made
to
do
this
i
consider
great
nonsense
but
i
would
nevertheless
take
him
on
his
own
terms
if
it
was
only
i
that
was
concerned
but
i
keep
thinking
of
those
two
praying
trusting
neighbors
of
yours
and
i
feel
wretchedly
like
a
swindler
if
his
working
mood
came
but
once
in
five
years
i
would
willingly
wait
for
it
and
maintain
him
in
leisure
if
need
be
in
the
intervals
but
that
would
be
a
sorry
account
to
present
to
them
five
years
of
this
sort
of
thing
moreover
would
effectually
settle
the
question
i
wish
he
were
less
of
a
genius
and
more
of
a
charlatan
he
s
too
confoundedly
all
of
one
piece
he
won
t
throw
overboard
a
grain
of
the
cargo
to
save
the
rest
fancy
him
thus
with
all
his
brilliant
personal
charm
his
handsome
head
his
careless
step
his
look
as
of
a
nervous
apollo
and
you
will
understand
that
there
is
mighty
little
comfort
in
seeing
him
in
a
bad
way
he
was
tolerably
foolish
last
summer
at
baden
baden
but
he
got
on
his
feet
and
for
a
while
he
was
steady
then
he
began
to
waver
again
and
at
last
toppled
over
now
literally
he
s
lying
prone
he
came
into
my
room
last
night
miserably
tipsy
i
assure
you
it
did
n
t
amuse
me
about
miss
light
it
s
a
long
story
she
is
one
of
the
great
beauties
of
all
time
and
worth
coming
barefoot
to
rome
like
the
pilgrims
of
old
to
see
her
complexion
her
glance
her
step
her
dusky
tresses
may
have
been
seen
before
in
a
goddess
but
never
in
a
woman
and
you
may
take
this
for
truth
because
i
m
not
in
love
with
her
on
the
contrary
her
education
has
been
simply
infernal
she
is
corrupt
perverse
as
proud
as
the
queen
of
sheba
and
an
appalling
coquette
but
she
is
generous
and
with
patience
and
skill
you
may
enlist
her
imagination
in
a
good
cause
as
well
as
in
a
bad
one
the
other
day
i
tried
to
manipulate
it
a
little
chance
offered
me
an
interview
to
which
it
was
possible
to
give
a
serious
turn
and
i
boldly
broke
ground
and
begged
her
to
suffer
my
poor
friend
to
go
in
peace
after
a
good
deal
of
finessing
she
consented
and
the
next
day
with
a
single
word
packed
him
off
to
naples
to
drown
his
sorrow
in
debauchery
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
more
dangerous
in
her
virtuous
moods
than
in
her
vicious
ones
and
that
she
probably
has
a
way
of
turning
her
back
which
is
the
most
provoking
thing
in
the
world
she
s
an
actress
she
could
n
t
forego
doing
the
thing
dramatically
and
it
was
the
dramatic
touch
that
made
it
fatal
i
wished
her
of
course
to
let
him
down
easily
but
she
desired
to
have
the
curtain
drop
on
an
attitude
and
her
attitudes
deprive
inflammable
young
artists
of
their
reason
roderick
made
an
admirable
bust
of
her
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
and
a
dozen
women
came
rushing
to
him
to
be
done
mutatis
mutandis
in
the
same
style
they
were
all
great
ladies
and
ready
to
take
him
by
the
hand
but
he
told
them
all
their
faces
did
n
t
interest
him
and
sent
them
away
vowing
his
at
this
point
of
his
long
effusion
rowland
had
paused
and
put
by
his
letter
he
kept
it
three
days
and
then
read
it
over
he
was
disposed
at
first
to
destroy
it
but
he
decided
finally
to
keep
it
in
the
hope
that
it
might
strike
a
spark
of
useful
suggestion
from
the
flint
of
cecilia
s
good
sense
we
know
he
had
a
talent
for
taking
advice
and
then
it
might
be
he
reflected
that
his
cousin
s
answer
would
throw
some
light
on
mary
garland
s
present
vision
of
things
in
his
altered
mood
he
added
these
few
lines
i
unburdened
myself
the
other
day
of
this
monstrous
load
of
perplexity
i
think
it
did
me
good
and
i
let
it
stand
i
was
in
a
melancholy
muddle
and
i
was
trying
to
work
myself
free
you
know
i
like
discussion
in
a
quiet
way
and
there
is
no
one
with
whom
i
can
have
it
as
quietly
as
with
you
most
sagacious
of
cousins
there
is
an
excellent
old
lady
with
whom
i
often
chat
and
who
talks
very
much
to
the
point
but
madame
grandoni
has
disliked
roderick
from
the
first
and
if
i
were
to
take
her
advice
i
would
wash
my
hands
of
him
you
will
laugh
at
me
for
my
long
face
but
you
would
do
that
in
any
circumstances
i
am
half
ashamed
of
my
letter
for
i
have
a
faith
in
my
friend
that
is
deeper
than
my
doubts
he
was
here
last
evening
talking
about
the
naples
museum
the
aristides
the
bronzes
the
pompeian
frescoes
with
such
a
beautiful
intelligence
that
doubt
of
the
ultimate
future
seemed
blasphemy
i
walked
back
to
his
lodging
with
him
and
he
was
as
mild
as
midsummer
moonlight
he
has
the
ineffable
something
that
charms
and
convinces
my
last
word
about
him
shall
not
be
a
harsh
shortly
after
sending
his
letter
going
one
day
into
his
friend
s
studio
he
found
roderick
suffering
from
the
grave
infliction
of
a
visit
from
leavenworth
roderick
submitted
with
extreme
ill
grace
to
being
bored
and
he
was
now
evidently
in
a
state
of
high
exasperation
he
had
lately
begun
a
representation
of
a
lazzarone
lounging
in
the
sun
an
image
of
serene
irresponsible
sensuous
life
the
real
lazzarone
he
had
admitted
was
a
vile
fellow
but
the
ideal
lazzarone
and
his
own
had
been
subtly
idealized
was
a
precursor
of
the
millennium
leavenworth
had
apparently
just
transferred
his
unhurrying
gaze
to
the
figure
something
in
the
style
of
the
dying
gladiator
he
sympathetically
observed
oh
no
said
roderick
seriously
he
s
not
dying
he
s
only
drunk
ah
but
intoxication
you
know
leavenworth
rejoined
is
not
a
proper
subject
for
sculpture
sculpture
should
not
deal
with
transitory
lying
dead
drunk
is
not
a
transitory
attitude
nothing
is
more
permanent
more
sculpturesque
more
monumental
an
entertaining
paradox
said
leavenworth
if
we
had
time
to
exercise
our
wits
upon
it
i
remember
at
florence
an
intoxicated
figure
by
michael
angelo
which
seemed
to
me
a
deplorable
aberration
of
a
great
mind
i
myself
touch
liquor
in
no
shape
whatever
i
have
traveled
through
europe
on
cold
water
the
most
varied
and
attractive
lists
of
wines
are
offered
me
but
i
brush
them
aside
no
cork
has
ever
been
drawn
at
my
command
the
movement
of
drawing
a
cork
calls
into
play
a
very
pretty
set
of
muscles
said
roderick
i
think
i
will
make
a
figure
in
that
a
bacchus
realistically
treated
my
dear
young
friend
never
trifle
with
your
lofty
mission
spotless
marble
should
represent
virtue
not
vice
and
leavenworth
placidly
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
exorcise
the
spirit
of
levity
while
his
glance
journeyed
with
leisurely
benignity
to
another
object
a
marble
replica
of
the
bust
of
miss
light
an
ideal
head
i
presume
he
went
on
a
fanciful
representation
of
one
of
the
pagan
goddesses
a
diana
a
flora
a
naiad
or
dryad
i
often
regret
that
our
american
artists
should
not
boldly
cast
off
that
extinct
she
is
neither
a
naiad
nor
a
dryad
said
roderick
and
her
name
is
as
good
as
yours
or
you
call
her
leavenworth
blandly
inquired
miss
light
rowland
interposed
in
charity
ah
our
great
american
beauty
not
a
pagan
goddess
an
american
christian
lady
yes
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
miss
light
her
conversational
powers
are
not
remarkable
but
her
beauty
is
of
a
high
order
i
observed
her
the
other
evening
at
a
large
party
where
some
of
the
proudest
members
of
the
european
aristocracy
were
present
duchesses
princesses
countesses
and
others
distinguished
by
similar
titles
but
for
beauty
grace
and
elegance
my
fair
countrywoman
left
them
all
nowhere
what
women
can
compare
with
a
truly
refined
american
lady
the
duchesses
the
other
night
had
no
attractions
for
my
eyes
they
looked
coarse
and
sensual
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
tyranny
of
class
distinctions
must
indeed
be
terrible
when
such
countenances
could
inspire
admiration
you
see
more
beautiful
girls
in
an
hour
on
broadway
than
in
the
whole
tour
of
europe
miss
light
now
on
broadway
would
excite
no
particular
she
has
never
been
there
cried
roderick
triumphantly
i
m
afraid
she
never
will
be
there
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
about
what
news
roderick
had
stood
with
his
back
turned
fiercely
poking
at
his
lazzarone
but
at
leavenworth
s
last
words
he
faced
quickly
about
it
s
the
news
of
the
hour
i
believe
miss
light
is
admired
by
the
highest
people
here
they
tacitly
recognize
her
superiority
she
has
had
offers
of
marriage
from
various
great
lords
i
was
extremely
happy
to
learn
this
circumstance
and
to
know
that
they
all
had
been
left
sighing
she
has
not
been
dazzled
by
their
titles
and
their
gilded
coronets
she
has
judged
them
simply
as
men
and
found
them
wanting
one
of
them
however
a
young
neapolitan
prince
i
believe
has
after
a
long
probation
succeeded
in
making
himself
acceptable
miss
light
has
at
last
said
yes
and
the
engagement
has
just
been
announced
i
am
not
generally
a
retailer
of
gossip
of
this
description
but
the
fact
was
alluded
to
an
hour
ago
by
a
lady
with
whom
i
was
conversing
and
here
in
europe
these
conversational
trifles
usurp
the
lion
s
share
of
one
s
attention
i
therefore
retained
the
circumstance
yes
i
regret
that
miss
light
should
marry
one
of
these
foreigners
americans
should
stand
by
each
other
if
she
wanted
a
brilliant
match
we
could
have
fixed
it
for
her
if
she
wanted
a
fine
fellow
a
fine
sharp
enterprising
modern
man
i
would
have
undertaken
to
find
him
for
her
without
going
out
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
if
she
wanted
a
big
fortune
i
would
have
found
her
twenty
that
she
would
have
had
hard
work
to
spend
money
down
not
tied
up
in
lands
and
villas
what
is
the
name
of
the
young
man
prince
castaway
or
some
such
thing
it
was
well
for
leavenworth
that
he
was
a
voluminous
and
imperturbable
talker
for
the
current
of
his
eloquence
floated
him
past
the
short
sharp
startled
cry
with
which
roderick
greeted
his
conversational
the
young
man
stood
looking
at
him
with
parted
lips
and
an
excited
eye
the
position
of
woman
leavenworth
placidly
resumed
is
certainly
a
very
degraded
one
in
these
countries
i
doubt
whether
a
european
princess
can
command
the
respect
which
in
our
country
is
exhibited
toward
the
obscurest
females
the
civilization
of
a
country
should
be
measured
by
the
deference
shown
to
the
weaker
sex
judged
by
that
standard
where
are
they
over
here
though
leavenworth
had
not
observed
roderick
s
emotion
it
was
not
lost
upon
rowland
who
was
making
certain
uncomfortable
reflections
upon
it
he
saw
that
it
had
instantly
become
one
with
the
acute
irritation
produced
by
the
poor
gentleman
s
oppressive
personality
and
that
an
explosion
of
some
sort
was
imminent
leavenworth
with
calm
unconsciousness
proceeded
to
fire
the
mine
and
now
for
our
culture
he
said
in
the
same
sonorous
tones
demanding
with
a
gesture
the
unveiling
of
the
figure
which
stood
somewhat
apart
muffled
in
a
great
sheet
roderick
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
with
concentrated
rancor
and
then
strode
to
the
statue
and
twitched
off
the
cover
leavenworth
settled
himself
into
his
chair
with
an
air
of
flattered
proprietorship
and
scanned
the
unfinished
image
i
can
conscientiously
express
myself
as
gratified
with
the
general
conception
he
said
the
figure
has
considerable
majesty
and
the
countenance
wears
a
fine
open
expression
the
forehead
however
strikes
me
as
not
sufficiently
intellectual
in
a
statue
of
culture
you
know
that
should
be
the
great
point
the
eye
should
instinctively
seek
the
forehead
could
n
t
you
heighten
it
up
a
little
roderick
for
all
answer
tossed
the
sheet
back
over
the
statue
oblige
me
sir
he
said
oblige
me
never
mention
that
thing
never
mention
it
why
my
dear
sir
never
mention
it
it
s
an
abomination
an
abomination
my
culture
yours
indeed
cried
roderick
it
s
none
of
mine
i
disown
disown
it
if
you
please
said
leavenworth
sternly
but
finish
it
first
i
d
rather
smash
it
cried
roderick
this
is
folly
sir
you
must
keep
your
i
made
no
engagement
a
sculptor
is
n
t
a
tailor
did
you
ever
hear
of
inspiration
mine
is
dead
and
it
s
no
laughing
matter
you
yourself
killed
i
i
killed
your
inspiration
cried
leavenworth
with
the
accent
of
righteous
wrath
you
re
a
very
ungrateful
boy
if
ever
i
encouraged
and
cheered
and
sustained
any
one
i
m
sure
i
have
done
so
to
i
appreciate
your
good
intentions
and
i
don
t
wish
to
be
uncivil
but
your
encouragement
is
superfluous
i
can
t
work
for
you
i
call
this
young
man
said
leavenworth
as
if
he
had
found
the
damning
word
oh
i
m
in
an
infernal
humor
roderick
answered
pray
sir
is
it
my
infelicitous
allusion
to
miss
light
s
marriage
it
s
your
infelicitous
everything
i
don
t
say
that
to
offend
you
i
beg
your
pardon
if
it
does
i
say
it
by
way
of
making
our
rupture
complete
irretrievable
rowland
had
stood
by
in
silence
but
he
now
interfered
listen
to
me
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
roderick
s
arm
you
are
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
gulf
if
you
suffer
anything
that
has
passed
to
interrupt
your
work
on
that
figure
you
take
your
plunge
it
s
no
matter
that
you
don
t
like
it
you
will
do
the
wisest
thing
you
ever
did
if
you
make
that
effort
of
will
necessary
for
finishing
it
destroy
the
statue
then
if
you
like
but
make
the
effort
i
speak
the
truth
roderick
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
still
inexorableness
made
almost
tender
you
too
he
simply
said
rowland
felt
that
he
might
as
well
attempt
to
squeeze
water
from
a
polished
crystal
as
hope
to
move
him
he
turned
away
and
walked
into
the
adjoining
room
with
a
sense
of
sickening
helplessness
in
a
few
moments
he
came
back
and
found
that
leavenworth
had
departed
presumably
in
a
manner
somewhat
portentous
roderick
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
rowland
made
one
more
attempt
you
decline
to
think
of
what
i
urge
there
s
one
more
point
that
you
shouldn
t
for
a
month
go
to
light
i
go
there
this
that
too
is
an
utter
there
are
such
things
as
necessary
you
are
not
reflecting
you
are
speaking
in
why
then
do
you
make
me
speak
rowland
meditated
a
moment
is
it
also
necessary
that
you
should
lose
the
best
friend
you
have
roderick
looked
up
that
s
for
you
to
settle
his
best
friend
clapped
on
his
hat
and
strode
away
in
a
moment
the
door
closed
behind
him
rowland
walked
hard
for
nearly
a
couple
of
hours
he
passed
up
the
corso
out
of
the
porta
del
popolo
and
into
the
villa
borghese
of
which
he
made
a
complete
circuit
the
keenness
of
his
irritation
subsided
but
it
left
him
with
an
intolerable
weight
upon
his
heart
when
dusk
had
fallen
he
found
himself
near
the
lodging
of
his
friend
madame
grandoni
he
frequently
paid
her
a
visit
during
the
hour
which
preceded
dinner
and
he
now
ascended
her
unillumined
staircase
and
rang
at
her
relaxed
with
an
especial
desire
for
diversion
he
was
told
that
for
the
moment
she
was
occupied
but
that
if
he
would
come
in
and
wait
she
would
presently
be
with
him
he
had
not
sat
musing
in
the
firelight
for
ten
minutes
when
he
heard
the
jingle
of
the
and
then
a
rustling
and
murmuring
in
the
hall
the
door
of
the
little
saloon
opened
but
before
the
visitor
appeared
he
had
recognized
her
voice
christina
light
swept
forward
preceded
by
her
poodle
and
almost
filling
the
narrow
parlor
with
the
train
of
her
dress
she
was
colored
here
and
there
by
the
flicking
firelight
they
told
me
you
were
here
she
said
simply
as
she
took
a
seat
and
yet
you
came
in
it
is
very
brave
said
rowland
you
are
the
brave
one
when
one
thinks
of
it
where
is
the
padrona
occupied
for
the
moment
but
she
is
how
soon
i
have
already
waited
ten
minutes
i
expect
her
from
moment
to
meanwhile
we
are
alone
and
she
glanced
into
the
dusky
corners
of
the
room
unless
stenterello
counts
said
rowland
oh
he
knows
my
secrets
unfortunate
brute
she
sat
silent
awhile
looking
into
the
firelight
then
at
last
glancing
at
rowland
come
say
something
pleasant
she
exclaimed
i
have
been
very
happy
to
hear
of
your
no
i
don
t
mean
that
i
have
heard
that
so
often
only
since
breakfast
that
it
has
lost
all
sense
i
mean
some
of
those
unexpected
charming
things
that
you
said
to
me
a
month
ago
at
saint
cecilia
i
offended
you
then
said
rowland
i
was
afraid
i
ah
it
occurred
to
you
why
have
n
t
i
seen
you
since
really
i
don
t
and
he
began
to
hesitate
for
an
explanation
i
have
called
but
you
have
never
been
at
you
were
careful
to
choose
the
wrong
times
you
have
a
way
with
a
poor
girl
you
sit
down
and
inform
her
that
she
is
a
person
with
whom
a
respectable
young
man
can
not
associate
without
contamination
your
friend
is
a
very
nice
fellow
you
are
very
careful
of
his
morals
you
wish
him
to
know
none
but
nice
people
and
you
beg
me
therefore
to
desist
you
request
me
to
take
these
suggestions
to
heart
and
to
act
upon
them
as
promptly
as
possible
they
are
not
particularly
flattering
to
my
vanity
vanity
however
is
a
sin
and
i
listen
submissively
with
an
immense
desire
to
be
just
if
i
have
many
faults
i
know
it
in
a
general
way
and
i
try
on
the
whole
to
do
my
best
voyons
i
say
to
myself
it
is
n
t
particularly
charming
to
hear
one
s
self
made
out
such
a
low
person
but
it
is
worth
thinking
over
there
s
probably
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
it
and
at
any
rate
we
must
be
as
good
a
girl
as
we
can
that
s
the
great
point
and
then
here
s
a
magnificent
chance
for
humility
if
there
s
doubt
in
the
matter
let
the
doubt
count
against
one
s
self
that
is
what
saint
catherine
did
and
saint
theresa
and
all
the
others
and
they
are
said
to
have
had
in
consequence
the
most
ineffable
joys
let
us
go
in
for
a
little
ineffable
joy
i
tried
it
i
swallowed
my
rising
sobs
i
made
you
my
courtesy
i
determined
i
would
not
be
spiteful
nor
passionate
nor
vengeful
nor
anything
that
is
supposed
to
be
particularly
feminine
i
was
a
better
girl
than
you
made
out
better
at
least
than
you
thought
but
i
would
let
the
difference
go
and
do
magnificently
right
lest
i
should
not
do
right
enough
i
thought
of
it
a
deal
for
six
hours
when
i
know
i
did
n
t
seem
to
be
and
then
at
last
i
did
it
santo
dio
my
dear
miss
light
my
dear
miss
light
said
rowland
pleadingly
since
then
the
young
girl
went
on
i
have
been
waiting
for
the
ineffable
joys
they
have
n
t
yet
turned
up
pray
listen
to
me
rowland
urged
nothing
nothing
nothing
has
come
of
it
i
have
passed
the
dreariest
month
of
my
life
my
dear
miss
light
you
are
a
very
terrible
young
lady
cried
rowland
what
do
you
mean
by
that
a
good
many
things
we
ll
talk
them
over
but
first
forgive
me
if
i
have
offended
you
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
hesitating
and
then
thrust
her
hands
into
her
muff
that
means
nothing
forgiveness
is
between
equals
and
you
don
t
regard
me
as
your
really
i
don
t
understand
christina
rose
and
moved
for
a
moment
about
the
room
then
turning
suddenly
you
don
t
believe
in
me
she
cried
not
a
grain
i
don
t
know
what
i
would
not
give
to
force
you
to
believe
in
me
rowland
sprang
up
protesting
but
before
he
had
time
to
go
far
one
of
the
scanty
portieres
was
raised
and
madame
grandoni
came
in
pulling
her
wig
straight
but
you
shall
believe
in
me
yet
murmured
christina
as
she
passed
toward
her
hostess
madame
grandoni
turned
tenderly
to
christina
i
must
give
you
a
very
solemn
kiss
my
dear
you
are
the
heroine
of
the
hour
you
have
really
accepted
him
eh
so
they
say
but
you
ought
to
know
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
care
she
stood
with
her
hand
in
madame
grandoni
s
but
looking
askance
at
rowland
that
s
a
pretty
state
of
mind
said
the
old
lady
for
a
young
person
who
is
going
to
become
a
christina
shrugged
her
shoulders
every
one
expects
me
to
go
into
ecstacies
over
that
could
anything
be
more
vulgar
they
may
chuckle
by
themselves
will
you
let
me
stay
to
dinner
if
you
can
dine
on
a
risotto
but
i
imagine
you
are
expected
at
you
are
right
prince
casamassima
dines
there
en
famille
but
i
m
not
in
his
family
yet
do
you
know
you
are
very
wicked
i
have
half
a
mind
not
to
keep
christina
dropped
her
eyes
reflectively
i
beg
you
will
let
me
stay
she
said
if
you
wish
to
cure
me
of
my
wickedness
you
must
be
very
patient
and
kind
with
me
it
will
be
worth
the
trouble
you
must
show
confidence
in
and
she
gave
another
glance
at
rowland
then
suddenly
in
a
different
tone
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
saying
she
cried
i
am
weary
i
am
more
lonely
than
ever
i
wish
i
were
dead
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
she
struggled
with
them
an
instant
and
buried
her
face
in
her
muff
but
at
last
she
burst
into
uncontrollable
sobs
and
flung
her
arms
upon
madame
grandoni
s
neck
this
shrewd
woman
gave
rowland
a
significant
nod
and
a
little
shrug
over
the
young
girl
s
beautiful
bowed
head
and
then
led
christina
tenderly
away
into
the
adjoining
room
rowland
left
alone
stood
there
for
an
instant
intolerably
puzzled
face
to
face
with
miss
light
s
poodle
who
had
set
up
a
sharp
unearthly
cry
of
sympathy
with
his
mistress
rowland
vented
his
confusion
in
dealing
a
rap
with
his
stick
at
the
animal
s
unmelodious
muzzle
and
then
rapidly
left
the
house
he
saw
light
s
carriage
waiting
at
the
door
and
heard
afterwards
that
christina
went
home
to
dinner
a
couple
of
days
later
he
went
for
a
fortnight
to
florence
he
had
twenty
minds
to
leave
italy
altogether
and
at
florence
he
could
at
least
more
freely
decide
upon
his
future
movements
he
felt
profoundly
incurably
disgusted
reflective
benevolence
stood
prudently
aside
and
for
the
time
touched
the
source
of
his
irritation
with
no
softening
it
was
the
middle
of
march
and
by
the
middle
of
march
in
florence
the
spring
is
already
warm
and
deep
he
had
an
infinite
relish
for
the
place
and
the
season
but
as
he
strolled
by
the
arno
and
paused
here
and
there
in
the
great
galleries
they
failed
to
soothe
his
irritation
he
was
sore
at
heart
and
as
the
days
went
by
the
soreness
deepened
rather
than
healed
he
felt
as
if
he
had
a
complaint
against
fortune
as
he
was
his
this
time
quite
declined
to
let
it
pass
he
had
tried
to
be
wise
he
had
tried
to
be
kind
he
had
embarked
upon
an
estimable
enterprise
but
his
wisdom
his
kindness
his
energy
had
been
thrown
back
in
his
face
he
was
disappointed
and
his
disappointment
had
an
angry
spark
in
it
the
sense
of
wasted
time
of
wasted
hope
and
faith
kept
him
constant
company
there
were
times
when
the
beautiful
things
about
him
only
exasperated
his
discontent
he
went
to
the
pitti
palace
and
raphael
s
madonna
of
the
chair
seemed
in
its
soft
serenity
to
mock
him
with
the
suggestion
of
unattainable
repose
he
lingered
on
the
bridges
at
sunset
and
knew
that
the
light
was
enchanting
and
the
mountains
divine
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
horribly
invidious
and
unwelcome
in
the
fact
he
felt
in
a
word
like
a
man
who
has
been
cruelly
defrauded
and
who
wishes
to
have
his
revenge
life
owed
him
he
thought
a
compensation
and
he
would
be
restless
and
resentful
until
he
found
it
he
knew
or
he
seemed
to
know
where
he
should
find
it
but
he
hardly
told
himself
and
thought
of
the
thing
under
mental
protest
as
a
man
in
want
of
money
may
think
of
certain
funds
that
he
holds
in
trust
in
his
melancholy
meditations
the
idea
of
something
better
than
all
this
something
that
might
softly
richly
interpose
something
that
might
reconcile
him
to
the
future
something
that
might
make
one
s
tenure
of
life
deep
and
zealous
instead
of
harsh
and
uneven
the
idea
of
concrete
compensation
in
a
word
shaped
itself
sooner
or
later
into
the
image
of
mary
garland
very
odd
you
may
say
that
at
this
time
of
day
rowland
should
still
be
brooding
over
a
plain
girl
of
whom
he
had
had
but
the
lightest
of
glimpses
two
years
before
very
odd
that
so
deep
an
impression
should
have
been
made
by
so
an
instrument
we
must
admit
the
oddity
and
offer
simply
in
explanation
that
his
sentiment
apparently
belonged
to
that
species
of
emotion
of
which
by
the
testimony
of
the
poets
the
very
name
and
essence
is
oddity
one
night
he
slept
but
half
an
hour
he
found
his
thoughts
taking
a
turn
which
excited
him
portentously
he
walked
up
and
down
his
room
half
the
night
it
looked
out
on
the
arno
the
noise
of
the
river
came
in
at
the
open
window
he
felt
like
dressing
and
going
down
into
the
streets
toward
morning
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
though
he
was
wide
awake
he
was
less
excited
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
his
idea
from
the
outside
that
he
judged
it
and
condemned
it
yet
it
stood
there
before
him
distinct
and
in
a
certain
way
imperious
during
the
day
he
tried
to
banish
it
and
forget
it
but
it
fascinated
haunted
at
moments
frightened
him
he
tried
to
amuse
himself
paid
visits
resorted
to
several
rather
violent
devices
for
diverting
his
thoughts
if
on
the
morrow
he
had
committed
a
crime
the
persons
whom
he
had
seen
that
day
would
have
testified
that
he
had
talked
strangely
and
had
not
seemed
like
himself
he
felt
certainly
very
unlike
himself
long
afterwards
in
retrospect
he
used
to
reflect
that
during
those
days
he
had
for
a
while
been
literally
beside
himself
his
idea
persisted
it
clung
to
him
like
a
sturdy
beggar
the
sense
of
the
matter
roughly
expressed
was
this
if
roderick
was
really
going
as
he
himself
had
phrased
it
to
fizzle
out
one
might
help
him
on
the
way
one
might
smooth
the
descensus
averno
for
hours
there
swam
before
rowland
s
eyes
a
vision
of
roderick
graceful
and
beautiful
as
he
passed
plunging
like
a
diver
from
an
eminence
into
a
misty
gulf
the
gulf
was
destruction
annihilation
death
but
if
death
was
decreed
why
should
not
the
agony
be
brief
beyond
this
vision
there
faintly
glimmered
another
as
in
the
children
s
game
of
the
magic
lantern
a
picture
is
superposed
on
the
white
wall
before
the
last
one
has
quite
faded
it
represented
mary
garland
standing
there
with
eyes
in
which
the
horror
seemed
slowly
slowly
to
expire
and
hanging
motionless
hands
which
at
last
made
no
resistance
when
his
own
offered
to
take
them
when
of
old
a
man
was
burnt
at
the
stake
it
was
cruel
to
have
to
be
present
but
if
one
was
present
it
was
kind
to
lend
a
hand
to
pile
up
the
fuel
and
make
the
flames
do
their
work
quickly
and
the
smoke
muffle
up
the
victim
with
all
deference
to
your
kindness
this
was
perhaps
an
obligation
you
would
especially
feel
if
you
had
a
reversionary
interest
in
something
the
victim
was
to
leave
behind
him
one
morning
in
the
midst
of
all
this
rowland
walked
heedlessly
out
of
one
of
the
city
gates
and
found
himself
on
the
road
to
fiesole
it
was
a
completely
lovely
day
the
march
sun
felt
like
may
as
the
english
poet
of
florence
says
the
shrubs
and
vines
that
hung
over
the
walls
of
villa
and
podere
flung
their
odorous
promise
into
the
warm
still
air
rowland
followed
the
winding
climbing
lanes
lingered
as
he
got
higher
beneath
the
rusty
cypresses
beside
the
low
parapets
where
you
look
down
on
the
charming
city
and
sweep
the
vale
of
the
arno
reached
the
little
square
before
the
cathedral
and
rested
awhile
in
the
massive
dusky
church
then
climbed
higher
to
the
franciscan
convent
which
is
poised
on
the
very
apex
of
the
mountain
he
rang
at
the
little
gateway
a
shabby
senile
brother
admitted
him
with
almost
maudlin
friendliness
there
was
a
dreary
chill
in
the
chapel
and
the
corridors
and
he
passed
rapidly
through
them
into
the
delightfully
steep
and
tangled
old
garden
which
runs
wild
over
the
forehead
of
the
great
hill
he
had
been
in
it
before
and
he
was
very
fond
of
it
the
garden
hangs
in
the
air
and
you
ramble
from
terrace
to
terrace
and
wonder
how
it
keeps
from
slipping
down
in
full
consummation
of
its
bereaved
forlornness
into
the
nakedly
romantic
gorge
beneath
it
was
just
noon
when
rowland
went
in
and
after
roaming
about
awhile
he
flung
himself
in
the
sun
on
a
mossy
stone
bench
and
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
the
short
shadows
of
the
cypresses
above
him
had
grown
very
long
and
yet
he
had
not
passed
back
through
the
convent
one
of
the
monks
in
his
faded
robe
came
wandering
out
into
the
garden
reading
his
greasy
little
breviary
suddenly
he
came
toward
the
bench
on
which
rowland
had
stretched
himself
and
paused
a
moment
attentively
rowland
was
lingering
there
still
he
was
sitting
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
the
sandaled
tread
of
the
good
brother
but
as
the
monk
remained
watching
him
he
at
last
looked
up
it
was
not
the
ignoble
old
man
who
had
admitted
him
but
a
pale
gaunt
personage
of
a
graver
and
more
ascetic
and
yet
of
a
benignant
aspect
rowland
s
face
bore
the
traces
of
extreme
trouble
the
frate
kept
his
finger
in
his
little
book
and
folded
his
arms
picturesquely
across
his
breast
it
can
hardly
be
determined
whether
his
attitude
as
he
bent
his
sympathetic
italian
eye
upon
rowland
was
a
happy
accident
or
the
result
of
an
exquisite
spiritual
discernment
to
rowland
at
any
rate
under
the
emotion
of
that
moment
it
seemed
blessedly
opportune
he
rose
and
approached
the
monk
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
arm
my
brother
he
said
did
you
ever
see
the
devil
the
frate
gazed
gravely
and
crossed
himself
heaven
forbid
he
was
here
rowland
went
on
here
in
this
lovely
garden
as
he
was
once
in
paradise
half
an
hour
ago
but
have
no
fear
i
drove
him
and
rowland
stooped
and
picked
up
his
hat
which
had
rolled
away
into
a
bed
of
cyclamen
in
vague
symbolism
of
an
actual
physical
tussle
you
have
been
tempted
my
brother
asked
the
friar
tenderly
hideously
and
you
have
resisted
and
conquered
i
believe
i
have
the
blessed
saint
francis
be
praised
it
is
well
done
if
you
like
we
will
offer
a
mass
for
i
am
not
a
catholic
said
rowland
the
frate
smiled
with
dignity
that
is
a
reason
the
but
it
s
for
you
then
to
choose
shake
hands
with
me
rowland
added
that
will
do
as
well
and
suffer
me
as
i
go
out
to
stop
a
moment
in
your
they
shook
hands
and
separated
the
frate
crossed
himself
opened
his
book
and
wandered
away
in
relief
against
the
western
sky
rowland
passed
back
into
the
convent
and
paused
long
enough
in
the
chapel
to
look
for
the
he
had
had
what
is
vulgarly
termed
a
great
scare
he
believed
very
poignantly
for
the
time
in
the
devil
and
he
felt
an
irresistible
need
to
subscribe
to
any
institution
which
engaged
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
the
next
day
he
returned
to
rome
and
the
day
afterwards
he
went
in
search
of
roderick
he
found
him
on
the
pincian
with
his
back
turned
to
the
crowd
looking
at
the
sunset
i
went
to
florence
rowland
said
and
i
thought
of
going
farther
but
i
came
back
on
purpose
to
give
you
another
piece
of
advice
once
more
you
refuse
to
leave
rome
never
said
roderick
the
only
chance
that
i
see
then
of
your
reviving
your
sense
of
responsibility
to
to
those
various
sacred
things
you
have
forgotten
is
in
sending
for
your
mother
to
join
you
roderick
stared
for
my
mother
for
your
mother
and
for
miss
roderick
still
stared
and
then
slowly
and
faintly
his
face
flushed
for
mary
garland
for
my
mother
he
repeated
send
for
them
tell
me
this
i
have
often
wondered
but
till
now
i
have
forborne
to
ask
you
are
still
engaged
to
miss
garland
roderick
frowned
darkly
but
assented
it
would
give
you
pleasure
then
to
see
her
roderick
turned
away
and
for
some
moments
answered
nothing
pleasure
he
said
at
last
huskily
call
it
i
regard
you
as
a
sick
man
rowland
continued
in
such
a
case
miss
garland
would
say
that
her
place
was
at
your
roderick
looked
at
him
some
time
askance
mistrustfully
is
this
a
snare
he
asked
slowly
rowland
had
come
back
with
all
his
patience
rekindled
but
these
words
gave
it
an
almost
fatal
chill
heaven
forgive
you
he
cried
bitterly
my
idea
has
been
simply
this
try
in
decency
to
understand
it
i
have
tried
to
befriend
you
to
help
you
to
inspire
you
with
confidence
and
i
have
failed
i
took
you
from
the
hands
of
your
mother
and
your
betrothed
and
it
seemed
to
me
my
duty
to
restore
you
to
their
hands
that
s
all
i
have
to
he
was
going
but
roderick
forcibly
detained
him
it
would
have
been
but
a
rough
way
of
expressing
it
to
say
that
one
could
never
know
how
roderick
would
take
a
thing
it
had
happened
more
than
once
that
when
hit
hard
deservedly
he
had
received
the
blow
with
touching
gentleness
on
the
other
hand
he
had
often
resented
the
softest
taps
the
secondary
effect
of
rowland
s
present
admonition
seemed
reassuring
i
beg
you
to
wait
he
said
to
forgive
that
shabby
speech
and
to
let
me
and
he
walked
up
and
down
awhile
reflecting
at
last
he
stopped
with
a
look
in
his
face
that
rowland
had
not
seen
all
winter
it
was
a
strikingly
beautiful
look
how
strange
it
is
he
said
that
the
simplest
devices
are
the
last
that
occur
to
one
and
he
broke
into
a
light
laugh
to
see
mary
garland
is
just
what
i
want
and
my
mother
my
mother
can
t
hurt
me
you
will
write
then
i
will
telegraph
they
must
come
at
whatever
cost
striker
can
arrange
it
all
for
in
a
couple
of
days
he
told
rowland
that
he
had
received
a
telegraphic
answer
to
his
message
informing
him
that
the
two
ladies
were
to
sail
immediately
for
leghorn
in
one
of
the
small
steamers
which
ply
between
that
port
and
new
york
they
would
arrive
therefore
in
less
than
a
month
rowland
passed
this
month
of
expectation
in
no
very
serene
frame
of
mind
his
suggestion
had
had
its
source
in
the
deepest
places
of
his
agitated
conscience
but
there
was
something
intolerable
in
the
thought
of
the
suffering
to
which
the
event
was
probably
subjecting
those
undefended
women
they
had
scraped
together
their
scanty
funds
and
embarked
at
hours
notice
upon
the
dreadful
sea
to
journey
tremulously
to
shores
darkened
by
the
shadow
of
deeper
alarms
he
could
only
promise
himself
to
be
their
devoted
friend
and
servant
preoccupied
as
he
was
he
was
able
to
observe
that
expectation
with
roderick
took
a
form
which
seemed
singular
even
among
his
characteristic
singularities
if
redemption
roderick
seemed
to
reason
was
to
arrive
with
his
mother
and
his
affianced
bride
these
last
moments
of
error
should
be
doubly
erratic
he
did
nothing
but
inaction
with
him
took
on
an
unwonted
air
of
gentle
gayety
he
laughed
and
whistled
and
went
often
to
light
s
though
rowland
knew
not
in
what
fashion
present
circumstances
had
modified
his
relations
with
christina
the
month
ebbed
away
and
rowland
daily
expected
to
hear
from
roderick
that
he
had
gone
to
leghorn
to
meet
the
ship
he
heard
nothing
and
late
one
evening
not
having
seen
his
friend
in
three
or
four
days
he
stopped
at
roderick
s
lodging
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
gone
at
last
a
cab
was
standing
in
the
street
but
as
it
was
a
couple
of
doors
off
he
hardly
heeded
it
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
was
dark
like
most
roman
halls
and
he
paused
in
the
on
hearing
the
advancing
footstep
of
a
person
with
whom
he
wished
to
avoid
coming
into
collision
while
he
did
so
he
heard
another
footstep
behind
him
and
turning
round
found
that
roderick
in
person
had
just
overtaken
him
at
the
same
moment
a
woman
s
figure
advanced
from
within
into
the
light
of
the
and
a
face
glanced
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
he
gave
a
cry
it
was
the
face
of
mary
garland
her
glance
flew
past
him
to
roderick
and
in
a
second
a
startled
exclamation
broke
from
her
own
lips
it
made
rowland
turn
again
roderick
stood
there
pale
apparently
trying
to
speak
but
saying
nothing
his
lips
were
parted
and
he
was
wavering
slightly
with
a
strange
movement
the
movement
of
a
man
who
has
drunk
too
much
then
rowland
s
eyes
met
miss
garland
s
again
and
her
own
which
had
rested
a
moment
on
roderick
s
were
formidable
chapter
ix
mary
garland
how
it
befell
that
roderick
had
failed
to
be
in
leghorn
on
his
mother
s
arrival
never
clearly
transpired
for
he
undertook
to
give
no
elaborate
explanation
of
his
fault
he
never
indulged
in
professions
touching
personal
conduct
as
to
the
future
or
in
remorse
as
to
the
past
and
as
he
would
have
asked
no
praise
if
he
had
traveled
night
and
day
to
embrace
his
mother
as
she
set
foot
on
shore
he
made
in
rowland
s
presence
at
least
no
apology
for
having
left
her
to
come
in
search
of
him
it
was
to
be
said
that
thanks
to
an
unprecedentedly
fine
season
the
voyage
of
the
two
ladies
had
been
surprisingly
rapid
and
that
according
to
common
probabilities
if
roderick
had
left
rome
on
the
morrow
as
he
declared
that
he
had
intended
he
would
have
had
a
day
or
two
of
waiting
at
leghorn
rowland
s
silent
inference
was
that
christina
light
had
beguiled
him
into
letting
the
time
slip
and
it
was
accompanied
with
a
silent
inquiry
whether
she
had
done
so
unconsciously
or
maliciously
he
had
told
her
presumably
that
his
mother
and
his
cousin
were
about
to
arrive
and
it
was
pertinent
to
remember
hereupon
that
she
was
a
young
lady
of
mysterious
impulses
rowland
heard
in
due
time
the
story
of
the
adventures
of
the
two
ladies
from
northampton
miss
garland
s
wish
at
leghorn
on
finding
they
were
left
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
had
been
to
telegraph
to
roderick
and
await
an
answer
for
she
knew
that
their
arrival
was
a
trifle
premature
but
hudson
s
maternal
heart
had
taken
the
alarm
roderick
s
sending
for
them
was
to
her
imagination
a
confession
of
illness
and
his
not
being
at
leghorn
a
proof
of
it
an
hour
s
delay
was
therefore
cruel
both
to
herself
and
to
him
she
insisted
on
immediate
departure
and
unskilled
as
they
were
in
the
mysteries
of
foreign
or
even
of
domestic
travel
they
had
hurried
in
trembling
eagerness
to
rome
they
had
arrived
late
in
the
evening
and
knowing
nothing
of
inns
had
got
into
a
cab
and
proceeded
to
roderick
s
lodging
at
the
door
poor
hudson
s
frightened
anxiety
had
overcome
her
and
she
had
sat
quaking
and
crying
in
the
vehicle
too
weak
to
move
miss
garland
had
bravely
gone
in
groped
her
way
up
the
dusky
staircase
reached
roderick
s
door
and
with
the
assistance
of
such
acquaintance
with
the
italian
tongue
as
she
had
culled
from
a
during
the
calmer
hours
of
the
voyage
had
learned
from
the
old
woman
who
had
her
cousin
s
household
economy
in
charge
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
and
had
gone
forth
a
few
hours
before
with
his
hat
on
his
ear
per
divertirsi
these
things
rowland
learned
during
a
visit
he
paid
the
two
ladies
the
evening
after
their
arrival
hudson
spoke
of
them
at
great
length
and
with
an
air
of
clinging
confidence
in
rowland
which
told
him
how
faithfully
time
had
served
him
in
her
imagination
but
her
fright
was
over
though
she
was
still
catching
her
breath
a
little
like
a
person
dragged
ashore
out
of
waters
uncomfortably
deep
she
was
excessively
bewildered
and
confused
and
seemed
more
than
ever
to
demand
a
tender
handling
from
her
friends
before
miss
garland
rowland
was
distinctly
conscious
that
he
trembled
he
wondered
extremely
what
was
going
on
in
her
mind
what
was
her
silent
commentary
on
the
incidents
of
the
night
before
he
wondered
all
the
more
because
he
immediately
perceived
that
she
was
greatly
changed
since
their
parting
and
that
the
change
was
by
no
means
for
the
worse
she
was
older
easier
more
free
more
like
a
young
woman
who
went
sometimes
into
company
she
had
more
beauty
as
well
inasmuch
as
her
beauty
before
had
been
the
depth
of
her
expression
and
the
sources
from
which
this
beauty
was
fed
had
in
these
two
years
evidently
not
wasted
themselves
rowland
felt
almost
instantly
he
could
hardly
have
said
why
it
was
in
her
voice
in
her
tone
in
the
air
that
a
total
change
had
passed
over
her
attitude
towards
himself
she
trusted
him
now
absolutely
whether
or
no
she
liked
him
she
believed
he
was
solid
he
felt
that
during
the
coming
weeks
he
would
need
to
be
solid
hudson
was
at
one
of
the
smaller
hotels
and
her
was
frugally
lighted
by
a
couple
of
candles
rowland
made
the
most
of
this
dim
illumination
to
try
to
detect
the
afterglow
of
that
frightened
flash
from
miss
garland
s
eyes
the
night
before
it
had
been
but
a
flash
for
what
provoked
it
had
instantly
vanished
rowland
had
murmured
a
rapturous
blessing
on
roderick
s
head
as
he
perceived
him
instantly
apprehend
the
situation
if
he
had
been
drinking
its
gravity
sobered
him
on
the
spot
in
a
single
moment
he
collected
his
wits
the
next
moment
with
a
ringing
jovial
cry
he
was
folding
the
young
girl
in
his
arms
and
the
next
he
was
beside
his
mother
s
carriage
half
smothered
in
her
sobs
and
caresses
rowland
had
recommended
a
hotel
close
at
hand
and
had
then
discreetly
withdrawn
roderick
was
at
this
time
doing
his
part
superbly
and
miss
garland
s
brow
was
serene
it
was
serene
now
hours
later
but
nevertheless
her
alarm
had
lasted
an
appreciable
moment
what
had
become
of
it
it
had
dropped
down
deep
into
her
memory
and
it
was
lying
there
for
the
present
in
the
shade
but
with
another
week
rowland
said
to
himself
it
would
leap
erect
again
the
lightest
friction
would
strike
a
spark
from
it
rowland
thought
he
had
schooled
himself
to
face
the
issue
of
mary
garland
s
advent
casting
it
even
in
a
tragical
phase
but
in
her
personal
presence
in
which
he
found
a
poignant
mixture
of
the
familiar
and
the
strange
he
seemed
to
face
it
and
all
that
it
might
bring
with
it
for
the
first
time
in
vulgar
parlance
he
stood
uneasy
in
his
shoes
he
felt
like
walking
on
tiptoe
not
to
arouse
the
sleeping
shadows
he
felt
indeed
almost
like
saying
that
they
might
have
their
own
way
later
if
they
would
only
allow
to
these
first
few
days
the
clear
light
of
ardent
contemplation
for
rowland
at
last
was
ardent
and
all
the
bells
within
his
soul
were
ringing
bravely
in
jubilee
roderick
he
learned
had
been
the
whole
day
with
his
mother
and
had
evidently
responded
to
her
purest
trust
he
appeared
to
her
appealing
eyes
still
unspotted
by
the
world
that
is
what
it
is
thought
rowland
to
be
gifted
to
escape
not
only
the
superficial
but
the
intrinsic
penalties
of
misconduct
the
two
ladies
had
spent
the
day
within
doors
resting
from
the
fatigues
of
travel
miss
garland
rowland
suspected
was
not
so
fatigued
as
she
suffered
it
to
be
assumed
she
had
remained
with
hudson
to
attend
to
her
personal
wants
which
the
latter
seemed
to
think
now
that
she
was
in
a
foreign
land
with
a
southern
climate
and
a
catholic
religion
would
forthwith
become
very
complex
and
formidable
though
as
yet
they
had
simply
resolved
themselves
into
a
desire
for
a
great
deal
of
tea
and
for
a
certain
extremely
familiar
old
black
and
white
shawl
across
her
feet
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
but
the
sense
of
novelty
was
evidently
strong
upon
miss
garland
and
the
light
of
expectation
was
in
her
eye
she
was
restless
and
excited
she
moved
about
the
room
and
went
often
to
the
window
she
was
observing
keenly
she
watched
the
italian
servants
intently
as
they
came
and
went
she
had
already
had
a
long
colloquy
with
the
french
chambermaid
who
had
expounded
her
views
on
the
roman
question
she
noted
the
small
differences
in
the
furniture
in
the
food
in
the
sounds
that
came
in
from
the
street
rowland
felt
in
all
this
that
her
intelligence
here
would
have
a
great
unfolding
he
wished
immensely
he
might
have
a
share
in
it
he
wished
he
might
show
her
rome
that
of
course
would
be
roderick
s
office
but
he
promised
himself
at
least
to
take
advantage
of
it
behooves
you
to
appreciate
your
good
fortune
he
said
to
her
to
be
young
and
elastic
and
yet
old
enough
and
wise
enough
to
discriminate
and
reflect
and
to
come
to
italy
for
the
first
time
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
that
life
offers
us
it
is
but
right
to
remind
you
of
it
so
that
you
make
the
most
of
opportunity
and
do
not
accuse
yourself
later
of
having
wasted
the
precious
miss
garland
looked
at
him
smiling
intently
and
went
to
the
window
again
i
expect
to
enjoy
it
she
said
don
t
be
afraid
i
am
not
i
am
afraid
we
are
not
qualified
you
know
said
hudson
we
are
told
that
you
must
know
so
much
that
you
must
have
read
so
many
books
our
taste
has
not
been
cultivated
when
i
was
a
young
lady
at
school
i
remember
i
had
a
medal
with
a
pink
ribbon
for
proficiency
in
ancient
history
the
seven
kings
or
is
it
the
seven
hills
and
quintus
curtius
and
julius
caesar
and
and
that
period
you
know
i
believe
i
have
my
medal
somewhere
in
a
drawer
now
but
i
have
forgotten
all
about
the
kings
but
after
roderick
came
to
italy
we
tried
to
learn
something
about
it
last
winter
mary
used
to
read
corinne
to
me
in
the
evenings
and
in
the
mornings
she
used
to
read
another
book
to
herself
what
was
it
mary
that
book
that
was
so
long
you
know
in
fifteen
volumes
it
was
sismondi
s
italian
republics
said
mary
simply
rowland
could
not
help
laughing
whereupon
mary
blushed
did
you
finish
it
he
asked
yes
and
began
another
a
shorter
one
roscoe
s
leo
the
did
you
find
them
interesting
oh
do
you
like
history
some
of
that
s
a
woman
s
answer
and
do
you
like
art
she
paused
a
moment
i
have
never
seen
it
you
have
great
advantages
now
my
dear
with
roderick
and
mallet
said
hudson
i
am
sure
no
young
lady
ever
had
such
advantages
you
come
straight
to
the
highest
authorities
roderick
i
suppose
will
show
you
the
practice
of
art
and
mallet
perhaps
if
he
will
be
so
good
will
show
you
the
theory
as
an
artist
s
wife
you
ought
to
know
something
about
one
learns
a
good
deal
about
it
here
by
simply
living
said
rowland
by
going
and
coming
about
one
s
daily
dear
dear
how
wonderful
that
we
should
be
here
in
the
midst
of
it
murmured
hudson
to
think
of
art
being
out
there
in
the
streets
we
did
n
t
see
much
of
it
last
evening
as
we
drove
from
the
depot
but
the
streets
were
so
dark
and
we
were
so
frightened
but
we
are
very
easy
now
are
n
t
we
mary
i
am
very
happy
said
mary
gravely
and
wandered
back
to
the
window
again
roderick
came
in
at
this
moment
and
kissed
his
mother
and
then
went
over
and
joined
miss
garland
rowland
sat
with
hudson
who
evidently
had
a
word
which
she
deemed
of
some
value
for
his
private
ear
she
followed
roderick
with
intensely
earnest
eyes
i
wish
to
tell
you
sir
she
said
how
very
grateful
how
very
thankful
what
a
happy
mother
i
am
i
feel
as
if
i
owed
it
all
to
you
sir
to
find
my
poor
boy
so
handsome
so
prosperous
so
elegant
so
famous
and
ever
to
have
doubted
of
you
what
must
you
think
of
me
you
re
our
guardian
angel
sir
i
often
say
so
to
rowland
wore
in
response
to
this
speech
a
rather
haggard
brow
he
could
only
murmur
that
he
was
glad
she
found
roderick
looking
well
he
had
of
course
promptly
asked
himself
whether
the
best
discretion
dictated
that
he
should
give
her
a
word
of
warning
just
turn
the
handle
of
the
door
through
which
later
disappointment
might
enter
he
had
determined
to
say
nothing
but
simply
to
wait
in
silence
for
roderick
to
find
effective
inspiration
in
those
confidently
expectant
eyes
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
he
was
seeking
for
it
now
he
remained
sometime
at
the
window
with
his
cousin
but
at
last
he
turned
away
and
came
over
to
the
fireside
with
a
contraction
of
the
eyebrows
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
miss
garland
s
influence
was
for
the
moment
at
least
not
soothing
she
presently
followed
him
and
for
an
instant
rowland
observed
her
watching
him
as
if
she
thought
him
strange
strange
enough
thought
rowland
he
may
seem
to
her
if
he
will
roderick
directed
his
glance
to
his
friend
with
a
certain
peremptory
air
which
roughly
interpreted
was
equivalent
to
a
request
to
share
the
intellectual
expense
of
entertaining
the
ladies
good
heavens
rowland
cried
within
himself
is
he
already
tired
of
them
of
course
we
must
begin
to
put
you
through
the
mill
roderick
said
to
his
mother
and
be
it
hereby
known
to
mallet
that
we
count
upon
him
to
turn
the
i
will
do
as
you
please
my
son
said
hudson
so
long
as
i
have
you
with
me
i
don
t
care
where
i
go
we
must
not
take
up
too
much
of
mallet
s
his
time
is
inexhaustible
he
has
nothing
under
the
sun
to
do
have
you
rowland
if
you
had
seen
the
big
hole
i
have
been
making
in
it
where
will
you
go
first
you
have
your
choice
from
the
scala
santa
to
the
cloaca
let
us
take
things
in
order
said
rowland
we
will
go
first
to
saint
peter
s
miss
garland
i
hope
you
are
impatient
to
see
saint
peter
i
would
like
to
go
first
to
roderick
s
studio
said
miss
garland
it
s
a
very
nasty
place
said
roderick
at
your
pleasure
yes
we
must
see
your
beautiful
things
before
we
can
look
contentedly
at
anything
else
said
hudson
i
have
no
beautiful
things
said
roderick
you
may
see
what
there
is
what
makes
you
look
so
odd
this
inquiry
was
abruptly
addressed
to
his
mother
who
in
response
glanced
appealingly
at
mary
and
raised
a
startled
hand
to
her
smooth
hair
no
it
s
your
face
said
roderick
what
has
happened
to
it
these
two
years
it
has
changed
its
your
mother
has
prayed
a
great
deal
said
miss
garland
simply
i
did
n
t
suppose
of
course
it
was
from
doing
anything
bad
it
makes
you
a
very
good
face
very
interesting
very
solemn
it
has
very
fine
lines
in
it
something
might
be
done
with
and
rowland
held
one
of
the
candles
near
the
poor
lady
s
head
she
was
covered
with
confusion
my
son
my
son
she
said
with
dignity
i
don
t
understand
in
a
flash
all
his
old
alacrity
had
come
to
him
i
suppose
a
man
may
admire
his
own
mother
he
cried
if
you
please
madame
you
ll
sit
to
me
for
that
head
i
see
it
i
see
it
i
will
make
something
that
a
queen
can
t
get
done
for
rowland
respectfully
urged
her
to
assent
he
saw
roderick
was
in
the
vein
and
would
probably
do
something
eminently
original
she
gave
her
promise
at
last
after
many
soft
inarticulate
protests
and
a
frightened
petition
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
keep
her
knitting
rowland
returned
the
next
day
with
plenty
of
zeal
for
the
part
roderick
had
assigned
to
him
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
go
to
saint
peter
s
roderick
was
in
high
and
in
the
carriage
was
watching
his
mother
with
a
fine
mixture
of
filial
and
professional
tenderness
hudson
looked
up
mistrustfully
at
the
tall
shabby
houses
and
grasped
the
side
of
the
barouche
in
her
hand
as
if
she
were
in
a
in
dangerous
waters
rowland
sat
opposite
to
miss
garland
she
was
totally
oblivious
of
her
companions
from
the
moment
the
carriage
left
the
hotel
she
sat
gazing
and
absorbed
at
the
objects
about
them
if
rowland
had
felt
disposed
he
might
have
made
a
joke
of
her
intense
seriousness
from
time
to
time
he
told
her
the
name
of
a
place
or
a
building
and
she
nodded
without
looking
at
him
when
they
emerged
into
the
great
square
between
bernini
s
colonnades
she
laid
her
hand
on
hudson
s
arm
and
sank
back
in
the
carriage
staring
up
at
the
vast
yellow
facade
of
the
church
inside
the
church
roderick
gave
his
arm
to
his
mother
and
rowland
constituted
himself
the
especial
guide
of
miss
garland
he
walked
with
her
slowly
everywhere
and
made
the
entire
circuit
telling
her
all
he
knew
of
the
history
of
the
building
this
was
a
great
deal
but
she
listened
attentively
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dome
to
rowland
himself
it
had
never
seemed
so
radiantly
sublime
as
at
these
moments
he
felt
almost
as
if
he
had
contrived
it
himself
and
had
a
right
to
be
proud
of
it
he
left
miss
garland
a
while
on
the
steps
of
the
choir
where
she
had
seated
herself
to
rest
and
went
to
join
their
companions
hudson
was
watching
a
great
circle
of
tattered
contadini
who
were
kneeling
before
the
image
of
saint
peter
the
fashion
of
their
tatters
fascinated
her
she
stood
gazing
at
them
in
a
sort
of
terrified
pity
and
could
not
be
induced
to
look
at
anything
else
rowland
went
back
to
miss
garland
and
sat
down
beside
her
well
what
do
you
think
of
europe
he
asked
smiling
i
think
it
s
horrible
she
said
abruptly
horrible
i
feel
so
strangely
i
could
almost
how
is
it
that
you
feel
so
sorry
for
the
poor
past
that
seems
to
have
died
here
in
my
heart
in
an
hour
but
surely
you
re
pleased
you
re
i
am
overwhelmed
here
in
a
single
hour
everything
is
changed
it
is
as
if
a
wall
in
my
mind
had
been
knocked
down
at
a
stroke
before
me
lies
an
immense
new
world
and
it
makes
the
old
one
the
poor
little
narrow
familiar
one
i
have
always
known
seem
but
you
did
n
t
come
to
rome
to
keep
your
eyes
fastened
on
that
narrow
little
world
forget
it
turn
your
back
on
it
and
enjoy
all
i
want
to
enjoy
it
but
as
i
sat
here
just
now
looking
up
at
that
golden
mist
in
the
dome
i
seemed
to
see
in
it
the
vague
shapes
of
certain
people
and
things
at
home
to
enjoy
as
you
say
as
these
things
demand
of
one
to
enjoy
them
is
to
break
with
one
s
past
and
breaking
is
a
pain
don
t
mind
the
pain
and
it
will
cease
to
trouble
you
enjoy
enjoy
it
is
your
duty
yours
especially
why
mine
especially
because
i
am
very
sure
that
you
have
a
mind
capable
of
doing
the
most
liberal
justice
to
everything
interesting
and
beautiful
you
are
extremely
you
don
t
know
said
miss
garland
simply
in
that
matter
one
feels
i
really
think
that
i
know
better
than
you
i
don
t
want
to
seem
patronizing
but
i
suspect
that
your
mind
is
susceptible
of
a
great
development
give
it
the
best
company
trust
it
let
it
go
she
looked
away
from
him
for
some
moments
down
the
gorgeous
vista
of
the
great
church
but
what
you
say
she
said
at
last
means
change
change
for
the
better
cried
rowland
how
can
one
tell
as
one
stands
one
knows
the
worst
it
seems
to
me
very
frightful
to
develop
she
added
with
her
complete
smile
one
is
in
for
it
in
one
way
or
another
and
one
might
as
well
do
it
with
a
good
grace
as
with
a
bad
since
one
can
t
escape
life
it
is
better
to
take
it
by
the
is
this
what
you
call
life
she
asked
what
do
you
mean
by
this
saint
peter
s
all
this
splendor
all
rome
pictures
ruins
statues
beggars
it
is
not
all
of
it
but
it
is
a
large
part
of
it
all
these
things
are
impregnated
with
life
they
are
the
fruits
of
an
old
and
complex
an
old
and
complex
civilization
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
like
don
t
conclude
on
that
point
just
yet
wait
till
you
have
tested
it
while
you
wait
you
will
see
an
immense
number
of
very
beautiful
things
things
that
you
are
made
to
understand
they
won
t
leave
you
as
they
found
you
then
you
can
judge
don
t
tell
me
i
know
nothing
about
your
understanding
i
have
a
right
to
assume
miss
garland
gazed
awhile
aloft
in
the
dome
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that
she
said
i
hope
at
least
that
at
a
cursory
glance
it
pleases
you
said
rowland
you
need
n
t
be
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
what
strikes
some
people
is
that
it
is
so
remarkably
oh
it
s
large
enough
it
s
very
wonderful
there
are
things
in
rome
then
she
added
in
a
moment
turning
and
looking
at
him
that
are
very
very
beautiful
lots
of
some
of
the
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
what
are
they
which
things
have
most
beauty
that
is
according
to
taste
i
should
say
the
how
long
will
it
take
to
see
them
all
to
know
at
least
something
about
them
you
can
see
them
all
as
far
as
mere
seeing
goes
in
a
fortnight
but
to
know
them
is
a
thing
for
one
s
leisure
the
more
time
you
spend
among
them
the
more
you
care
for
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
he
went
on
why
should
you
grudge
time
it
s
all
in
your
way
since
you
are
to
be
an
artist
s
i
have
thought
of
that
she
said
it
may
be
that
i
shall
always
live
here
among
the
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
very
possibly
i
should
like
to
see
you
ten
years
i
dare
say
i
shall
seem
greatly
altered
but
i
am
sure
of
one
of
what
that
for
the
most
part
i
shall
be
quite
the
same
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
believe
the
fine
things
you
say
about
my
understanding
but
even
if
they
are
true
it
won
t
matter
i
shall
be
what
i
was
made
what
i
am
now
a
young
woman
from
the
country
the
fruit
of
a
civilization
not
old
and
complex
but
new
and
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
that
s
an
excellent
perhaps
if
you
show
me
anything
more
you
will
not
always
think
so
kindly
of
it
therefore
i
warn
i
am
not
frightened
i
should
like
vastly
to
say
something
to
you
be
what
you
are
be
what
you
choose
but
do
sometimes
as
i
tell
if
rowland
was
not
frightened
neither
perhaps
was
miss
garland
but
she
seemed
at
least
slightly
disturbed
she
proposed
that
they
should
join
their
companions
hudson
spoke
under
her
breath
she
could
not
be
accused
of
the
want
of
reverence
sometimes
attributed
to
protestants
in
the
great
catholic
temples
mary
dear
she
whispered
suppose
we
had
to
kiss
that
dreadful
brass
toe
if
i
could
only
have
kept
our
at
northampton
as
bright
as
that
i
think
it
s
so
heathenish
but
roderick
says
he
thinks
it
s
roderick
had
evidently
grown
a
trifle
perverse
it
s
sublimer
than
anything
that
your
religion
asks
you
to
do
he
exclaimed
surely
our
religion
sometimes
gives
us
very
difficult
duties
said
miss
garland
the
duty
of
sitting
in
a
whitewashed
and
listening
to
a
nasal
puritan
i
admit
that
s
difficult
but
it
s
not
sublime
i
am
speaking
of
ceremonies
of
forms
it
is
in
my
line
you
know
to
make
much
of
forms
i
think
this
is
a
very
beautiful
one
could
n
t
you
do
it
he
demanded
looking
at
his
cousin
she
looked
back
at
him
intently
and
then
shook
her
head
i
think
not
why
not
i
don
t
know
i
could
n
t
during
this
little
discussion
our
four
friends
were
standing
near
the
venerable
image
of
saint
peter
and
a
squalid
peasant
a
tattered
ruffian
of
the
most
orthodox
italian
aspect
had
been
performing
his
devotions
before
it
he
turned
away
crossing
himself
and
hudson
gave
a
little
shudder
of
horror
after
that
she
murmured
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
is
as
good
as
any
one
and
here
is
another
oh
what
a
beautiful
person
a
young
lady
had
approached
the
sacred
effigy
after
having
wandered
away
from
a
group
of
companions
she
kissed
the
brazen
toe
touched
it
with
her
forehead
and
turned
round
facing
our
friends
rowland
then
recognized
christina
light
he
was
stupefied
had
she
suddenly
embraced
the
catholic
faith
it
was
but
a
few
weeks
before
that
she
had
treated
him
to
a
passionate
profession
of
indifference
had
she
entered
the
church
to
put
herself
en
regle
with
what
was
expected
of
a
princess
casamassima
while
rowland
was
mentally
asking
these
questions
she
was
approaching
him
and
his
friends
on
her
way
to
the
great
altar
at
first
she
did
not
perceive
them
mary
garland
had
been
gazing
at
her
you
told
me
she
said
gently
to
rowland
that
rome
contained
some
of
the
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
this
surely
is
one
of
them
at
this
moment
christina
s
eye
met
rowland
s
and
before
giving
him
any
sign
of
recognition
she
glanced
rapidly
at
his
companions
she
saw
roderick
but
she
gave
him
no
bow
she
looked
at
hudson
she
looked
at
mary
garland
at
mary
garland
she
looked
fixedly
piercingly
from
head
to
foot
as
the
slow
pace
at
which
she
was
advancing
made
possible
then
suddenly
as
if
she
had
perceived
roderick
for
the
first
time
she
gave
him
a
charming
nod
a
radiant
smile
in
a
moment
he
was
at
her
side
she
stopped
and
he
stood
talking
to
her
she
continued
to
look
at
miss
garland
why
roderick
knows
her
cried
hudson
in
an
whisper
i
supposed
she
was
some
great
she
is
almost
said
rowland
she
is
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
europe
and
roderick
has
made
her
her
bust
dear
dear
murmured
hudson
vaguely
shocked
what
a
strange
bonnet
she
has
very
strange
eyes
said
mary
and
turned
away
the
two
ladies
with
rowland
began
to
descend
toward
the
door
of
the
church
on
their
way
they
passed
light
the
cavaliere
and
the
poodle
and
rowland
informed
his
companions
of
the
relation
in
which
these
personages
stood
to
roderick
s
young
lady
think
of
it
mary
said
hudson
what
splendid
people
he
must
know
no
wonder
he
found
northampton
dull
i
like
the
poor
little
old
gentleman
said
mary
why
do
you
call
him
poor
rowland
asked
struck
with
the
observation
he
seems
so
she
answered
simply
as
they
were
reaching
the
door
they
were
overtaken
by
roderick
whose
interview
with
miss
light
had
perceptibly
brightened
his
eye
so
you
are
acquainted
with
princesses
said
his
mother
softly
as
they
passed
into
the
portico
miss
light
is
not
a
princess
said
roderick
curtly
but
mallet
says
so
urged
hudson
rather
disappointed
i
meant
that
she
was
going
to
be
said
rowland
it
s
by
no
means
certain
that
she
is
even
going
to
be
roderick
answered
ah
said
rowland
i
give
it
up
roderick
almost
immediately
demanded
that
his
mother
should
sit
to
him
at
his
studio
for
her
portrait
and
rowland
ventured
to
add
another
word
of
urgency
if
roderick
s
idea
really
held
him
it
was
an
immense
pity
that
his
inspiration
should
be
wasted
inspiration
in
these
days
had
become
too
precious
a
commodity
it
was
arranged
therefore
that
for
the
present
during
the
mornings
hudson
should
place
herself
at
her
son
s
service
this
involved
but
little
sacrifice
for
the
good
lady
s
appetite
for
antiquities
was
diminutive
and
the
usual
round
of
galleries
and
churches
fatigued
her
and
she
was
glad
to
purchase
immunity
from
by
a
regular
afternoon
drive
it
became
natural
in
this
way
that
miss
garland
having
her
mornings
free
rowland
should
propose
to
be
the
younger
lady
s
guide
in
whatever
explorations
she
might
be
disposed
to
make
she
said
she
knew
nothing
about
it
but
she
had
a
great
curiosity
and
would
be
glad
to
see
anything
that
he
would
show
her
rowland
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
accuse
roderick
of
neglect
of
the
young
girl
for
it
was
natural
that
the
inspirations
of
a
capricious
man
of
genius
when
they
came
should
be
imperious
but
of
course
he
wondered
how
miss
garland
felt
as
the
young
man
s
promised
wife
on
being
thus
expeditiously
handed
over
to
another
man
to
be
entertained
however
she
felt
he
was
certain
he
would
know
little
about
it
there
had
been
between
them
none
but
indirect
allusions
to
her
engagement
and
rowland
had
no
desire
to
discuss
it
more
largely
for
he
had
no
quarrel
with
matters
as
they
stood
they
wore
the
same
delightful
aspect
through
the
lovely
month
of
may
and
the
ineffable
charm
of
rome
at
that
period
seemed
but
the
radiant
sympathy
of
nature
with
his
happy
opportunity
the
weather
was
divine
each
particular
morning
as
he
walked
from
his
lodging
to
hudson
s
modest
inn
seemed
to
have
a
blessing
upon
it
the
elder
lady
had
usually
gone
off
to
the
studio
and
he
found
miss
garland
sitting
alone
at
the
open
window
turning
the
leaves
of
some
book
of
artistic
or
antiquarian
reference
that
he
had
given
her
she
always
had
a
smile
she
was
always
eager
alert
responsive
she
might
be
grave
by
nature
she
might
be
sad
by
circumstance
she
might
have
secret
doubts
and
pangs
but
she
was
essentially
young
and
strong
and
fresh
and
able
to
enjoy
her
enjoyment
was
not
especially
demonstrative
but
it
was
curiously
diligent
rowland
felt
that
it
was
not
amusement
and
sensation
that
she
coveted
but
knowledge
facts
that
she
might
noiselessly
lay
away
piece
by
piece
in
the
perfumed
darkness
of
her
serious
mind
so
that
under
this
head
at
least
she
should
not
be
a
perfectly
portionless
bride
she
never
merely
pretended
to
understand
she
let
things
go
in
her
modest
fashion
at
the
moment
but
she
watched
them
on
their
way
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
when
her
fancy
seemed
not
likely
to
be
missed
it
went
hurrying
after
them
and
ran
breathless
at
their
side
as
it
were
and
begged
them
for
the
secret
rowland
took
an
immense
satisfaction
in
observing
that
she
never
mistook
the
for
the
best
and
that
when
she
was
in
the
presence
of
a
masterpiece
she
recognized
the
occasion
as
a
mighty
one
she
said
many
things
which
he
thought
very
profound
that
is
if
they
really
had
the
fine
intention
he
suspected
this
point
he
usually
tried
to
ascertain
but
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
cautiously
for
in
her
mistrustful
shyness
it
seemed
to
her
that
must
necessarily
be
ironical
she
wished
to
know
just
where
she
was
going
what
she
would
gain
or
lose
this
was
partly
on
account
of
a
native
intellectual
purity
a
temper
of
mind
that
had
not
lived
with
its
door
ajar
as
one
might
say
upon
the
of
thought
for
passing
ideas
to
drop
in
and
out
at
their
pleasure
but
had
made
much
of
a
few
long
visits
from
guests
cherished
and
honored
guests
whose
presence
was
a
solemnity
but
it
was
even
more
because
she
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
growing
a
sense
of
devoting
her
life
not
to
her
own
ends
but
to
those
of
another
whose
life
would
be
large
and
brilliant
she
had
been
brought
up
to
think
a
great
deal
of
nature
and
nature
s
innocent
laws
but
now
rowland
had
spoken
to
her
ardently
of
culture
her
strenuous
fancy
had
responded
and
she
was
pursuing
culture
into
retreats
where
the
need
for
some
intellectual
effort
gave
a
noble
severity
to
her
purpose
she
wished
to
be
very
sure
to
take
only
the
best
knowing
it
to
be
the
best
there
was
something
exquisite
in
this
labor
of
pious
and
rowland
helped
it
though
its
fruits
were
not
for
him
in
spite
of
her
lurking
rigidity
and
angularity
it
was
very
evident
that
a
nervous
impulsive
sense
of
beauty
was
constantly
at
play
in
her
soul
and
that
her
actual
experience
of
beautiful
things
moved
her
in
some
very
deep
places
for
all
that
she
was
not
demonstrative
that
her
manner
was
simple
and
her
of
no
very
ample
flow
for
all
that
as
she
had
said
she
was
a
young
woman
from
the
country
and
the
country
was
west
nazareth
and
west
nazareth
was
in
its
way
a
stubborn
little
fact
she
was
feeling
the
direct
influence
of
the
great
amenities
of
the
world
and
they
were
shaping
her
with
a
divinely
intelligent
touch
oh
exquisite
virtue
of
circumstance
cried
rowland
to
himself
that
takes
us
by
the
hand
and
leads
us
forth
out
of
corners
where
perforce
our
attitudes
are
a
trifle
contracted
and
beguiles
us
into
testing
mistrusted
faculties
when
he
said
to
mary
garland
that
he
wished
he
might
see
her
ten
years
hence
he
was
paying
mentally
an
equal
compliment
to
circumstance
and
to
the
girl
herself
capacity
was
there
it
could
be
freely
trusted
observation
would
have
but
to
sow
its
generous
seed
a
superior
woman
the
idea
had
harsh
associations
but
he
watched
it
imaging
itself
in
the
vagueness
of
the
future
with
a
kind
of
hopeless
confidence
they
went
a
great
deal
to
saint
peter
s
for
which
rowland
had
an
exceeding
affection
a
large
measure
of
which
he
succeeded
in
infusing
into
his
companion
she
confessed
very
speedily
that
to
climb
the
long
low
yellow
steps
beneath
the
huge
florid
facade
and
then
to
push
the
ponderous
leathern
apron
of
the
door
to
find
one
s
self
confronted
with
that
builded
luminous
sublimity
was
a
sensation
of
which
the
keenness
renewed
itself
with
surprising
generosity
in
those
days
the
hospitality
of
the
vatican
had
not
been
curtailed
and
it
was
an
easy
and
delightful
matter
to
pass
from
the
gorgeous
church
to
the
solemn
company
of
the
antique
marbles
here
rowland
had
with
his
companion
a
great
deal
of
talk
and
found
himself
expounding
aesthetics
a
perte
de
vue
he
discovered
that
she
made
notes
of
her
likes
and
dislikes
in
a
little
memorandum
book
and
he
wondered
to
what
extent
she
reported
his
own
discourse
these
were
charming
hours
the
galleries
had
been
so
cold
all
winter
that
rowland
had
been
an
exile
from
them
but
now
that
the
sun
was
already
scorching
in
the
great
square
between
the
colonnades
where
the
twin
fountains
flashed
almost
fiercely
the
marble
coolness
of
the
long
vistas
made
them
a
delightful
refuge
the
great
herd
of
tourists
had
almost
departed
and
our
two
friends
often
found
themselves
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
in
sole
and
tranquil
possession
of
the
beautiful
braccio
nuovo
here
and
there
was
an
open
window
where
they
lingered
and
leaned
looking
out
into
the
warm
dead
air
over
the
towers
of
the
city
at
the
historic
hills
at
the
stately
shabby
gardens
of
the
palace
or
at
some
sunny
empty
court
lost
in
the
heart
of
the
labyrinthine
pile
they
went
sometimes
into
the
chambers
painted
by
raphael
and
of
course
paid
their
respects
to
the
sistine
chapel
but
mary
s
evident
preference
was
to
linger
among
the
statues
once
when
they
were
standing
before
that
noblest
of
sculptured
portraits
the
demosthenes
in
the
braccio
nuovo
she
made
the
only
spontaneous
allusion
to
her
projected
marriage
direct
or
indirect
that
had
yet
fallen
from
her
lips
i
am
so
glad
she
said
that
roderick
is
a
sculptor
and
not
a
the
allusion
resided
chiefly
in
the
extreme
earnestness
with
which
the
words
were
uttered
rowland
immediately
asked
her
the
reason
of
her
gladness
it
s
not
that
painting
is
not
fine
she
said
but
that
sculpture
is
finer
it
is
more
rowland
tried
at
times
to
make
her
talk
about
herself
but
in
this
she
had
little
skill
she
seemed
to
him
so
much
older
so
much
more
pliant
to
social
uses
than
when
he
had
seen
her
at
home
that
he
had
a
desire
to
draw
from
her
some
categorical
account
of
her
occupation
and
thoughts
he
told
her
his
desire
and
what
suggested
it
it
appears
then
she
said
that
after
all
one
can
grow
at
home
unquestionably
if
one
has
a
motive
your
growth
then
was
unconscious
you
did
not
watch
yourself
and
water
your
roots
she
paid
no
heed
to
his
question
i
am
willing
to
grant
she
said
that
europe
is
more
delightful
than
i
supposed
and
i
don
t
think
that
mentally
i
had
been
stingy
but
you
must
admit
that
america
is
better
than
you
have
i
have
not
a
fault
to
find
with
the
country
which
produced
you
rowland
thought
he
might
risk
this
smiling
and
yet
you
want
me
to
change
to
assimilate
europe
i
suppose
you
would
call
i
have
felt
that
desire
only
on
general
principles
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
feel
now
america
has
made
you
thus
far
let
america
finish
you
i
should
like
to
ship
you
back
without
delay
and
see
what
becomes
of
you
that
sounds
unkind
and
i
admit
there
is
a
cold
intellectual
curiosity
in
she
shook
her
head
the
charm
is
broken
the
thread
is
snapped
i
prefer
to
remain
invariably
when
he
was
inclined
to
make
of
something
they
were
talking
of
a
direct
application
to
herself
she
wholly
failed
to
assist
him
she
made
no
response
whereupon
once
with
a
spark
of
ardent
irritation
he
told
her
she
was
very
at
this
she
colored
a
little
and
he
said
that
in
default
of
any
larger
confidence
it
would
at
least
be
a
satisfaction
to
make
her
confess
to
that
charge
but
even
this
satisfaction
she
denied
him
and
his
only
revenge
was
in
making
two
or
three
times
afterward
a
softly
ironical
allusion
to
her
slyness
he
told
her
that
she
was
what
is
called
in
french
a
sournoise
very
good
she
answered
almost
indifferently
and
now
please
tell
me
again
i
have
forgotten
it
what
you
said
an
architrave
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
her
asking
him
a
question
of
this
kind
that
he
charged
her
with
a
humorous
emphasis
in
which
also
if
she
had
been
curious
in
the
matter
she
might
have
detected
a
spark
of
restless
ardor
with
having
an
insatiable
avidity
for
facts
you
are
always
snatching
at
information
he
said
you
will
never
consent
to
have
any
disinterested
she
frowned
a
little
as
she
always
did
when
he
arrested
their
talk
upon
something
personal
but
this
time
she
assented
and
said
that
she
knew
she
was
eager
for
facts
one
must
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
she
added
i
must
lay
up
a
store
of
learning
against
dark
days
somehow
my
imagination
refuses
to
compass
the
idea
that
i
may
be
in
rome
he
knew
he
had
divined
her
real
motives
but
he
felt
that
if
he
might
have
said
to
her
what
it
seemed
impossible
to
say
that
fortune
possibly
had
in
store
for
her
a
bitter
disappointment
she
would
have
been
capable
of
answering
immediately
after
the
first
sense
of
pain
say
then
that
i
am
laying
up
resources
for
solitude
but
all
the
accusations
were
not
his
he
had
been
watching
once
during
some
brief
argument
to
see
whether
she
would
take
her
forefinger
out
of
her
murray
into
which
she
had
inserted
it
to
keep
a
certain
page
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
why
this
point
interested
him
for
he
had
not
the
slightest
real
apprehension
that
she
was
dry
or
pedantic
the
simple
human
truth
was
the
poor
fellow
was
jealous
of
science
in
preaching
science
to
her
he
had
his
powers
of
suddenly
sinking
science
for
the
moment
she
looked
at
him
very
frankly
and
began
to
frown
at
the
same
time
she
let
the
murray
slide
down
to
the
ground
and
he
was
so
charmed
with
this
circumstance
that
he
made
no
movement
to
pick
it
up
you
are
singularly
inconsistent
mallet
she
said
how
that
first
day
that
we
were
in
saint
peter
s
you
said
things
that
inspired
me
you
bade
me
plunge
into
all
this
i
was
all
ready
i
only
wanted
a
little
push
yours
was
a
great
one
here
i
am
in
and
now
as
a
reward
for
my
bravery
you
have
repeatedly
snubbed
distinctly
then
said
rowland
i
strike
you
as
inconsistent
that
is
the
then
i
have
played
my
part
very
your
part
what
is
your
part
supposed
to
have
been
he
hesitated
a
moment
that
of
usefulness
pure
and
i
don
t
understand
you
she
said
and
picking
up
her
murray
she
fairly
buried
herself
in
it
that
evening
he
said
something
to
her
which
necessarily
increased
her
perplexity
though
it
was
not
uttered
with
such
an
intention
do
you
remember
he
asked
my
begging
you
the
other
day
to
do
occasionally
as
i
told
you
it
seemed
to
me
you
tacitly
very
i
have
never
yet
really
presumed
on
your
consent
but
now
i
would
like
you
to
do
this
whenever
you
catch
me
in
the
act
of
what
you
call
inconsistency
ask
me
the
meaning
of
some
architectural
term
i
will
know
what
you
mean
a
word
to
the
wise
one
morning
they
spent
among
the
ruins
of
the
palatine
that
sunny
desolation
of
crumbling
fragments
half
excavated
and
half
identified
known
as
the
palace
of
the
caesars
nothing
in
rome
is
more
interesting
and
no
locality
has
such
a
confusion
of
picturesque
charms
it
is
a
vast
rambling
garden
where
you
stumble
at
every
step
on
the
disinterred
bones
of
the
past
where
damp
frescoed
corridors
relics
possibly
of
nero
s
golden
house
serve
as
gigantic
bowers
and
where
in
the
springtime
you
may
sit
on
a
latin
inscription
in
the
shade
of
a
flowering
and
admire
the
composition
of
the
campagna
the
day
left
a
deep
impression
on
rowland
s
mind
partly
owing
to
its
intrinsic
sweetness
and
partly
because
his
companion
on
this
occasion
let
her
murray
lie
unopened
for
an
hour
and
asked
several
questions
irrelevant
to
the
consuls
and
the
caesars
she
had
begun
by
saying
that
it
was
coming
over
her
after
all
that
rome
was
a
ponderously
sad
place
the
sirocco
was
gently
blowing
the
air
was
heavy
she
was
tired
she
looked
a
little
pale
everything
she
said
seems
to
say
that
all
things
are
vanity
if
one
is
doing
something
i
suppose
one
feels
a
certain
strength
within
one
to
contradict
it
but
if
one
is
idle
surely
it
is
depressing
to
live
year
after
year
among
the
ashes
of
things
that
once
were
mighty
if
i
were
to
remain
here
i
should
either
become
permanently
low
as
they
say
or
i
would
take
refuge
in
some
dogged
daily
what
work
i
would
open
a
school
for
those
beautiful
little
beggars
though
i
am
sadly
afraid
i
should
never
bring
myself
to
scold
i
am
idle
said
rowland
and
yet
i
have
kept
up
a
certain
i
don
t
call
you
idle
she
answered
with
emphasis
it
is
very
good
of
you
do
you
remember
our
talking
about
that
in
northampton
during
that
picnic
perfectly
has
your
coming
abroad
succeeded
for
yourself
as
well
as
you
hoped
i
think
i
may
say
that
it
has
turned
out
as
well
as
i
are
you
happy
don
t
i
look
so
so
it
seems
to
me
but
and
she
hesitated
a
moment
i
imagine
you
look
happy
whether
you
are
so
or
i
m
like
that
ancient
comic
mask
that
we
saw
just
now
in
yonder
excavated
fresco
i
am
made
to
shall
you
come
back
here
next
winter
very
are
you
settled
here
forever
forever
is
a
long
time
i
live
only
from
year
to
shall
you
never
marry
rowland
gave
a
laugh
forever
never
you
handle
large
ideas
i
have
not
taken
a
vow
of
would
n
t
you
like
to
marry
i
should
like
it
to
this
she
made
no
rejoinder
but
presently
she
asked
why
don
t
you
write
a
book
rowland
laughed
this
time
more
freely
a
book
what
book
should
i
write
a
history
something
about
art
or
i
have
neither
the
learning
nor
the
she
made
no
attempt
to
contradict
him
she
simply
said
she
had
supposed
otherwise
you
ought
at
any
rate
she
continued
in
a
moment
to
do
something
for
for
myself
i
should
have
supposed
that
if
ever
a
man
seemed
to
live
for
himself
i
don
t
know
how
it
seems
she
interrupted
to
careless
observers
but
we
know
we
know
that
you
have
lived
a
great
deal
for
her
voice
trembled
slightly
and
she
brought
out
the
last
words
with
a
little
jerk
she
has
had
that
speech
on
her
conscience
thought
rowland
she
has
been
thinking
she
owed
it
to
me
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
now
was
her
time
to
make
it
and
have
done
with
she
went
on
in
a
way
which
confirmed
these
reflections
speaking
with
due
solemnity
you
ought
to
be
made
to
know
very
well
what
we
all
feel
hudson
tells
me
that
she
has
told
you
what
she
feels
of
course
roderick
has
expressed
himself
i
have
been
wanting
to
thank
you
too
i
do
from
my
rowland
made
no
answer
his
face
at
this
moment
resembled
the
tragic
mask
much
more
than
the
comic
but
miss
garland
was
not
looking
at
him
she
had
taken
up
her
murray
again
in
the
afternoon
she
usually
drove
with
hudson
but
rowland
frequently
saw
her
again
in
the
evening
he
was
apt
to
spend
half
an
hour
in
the
little
at
the
on
the
slope
of
the
pincian
and
roderick
who
dined
regularly
with
his
mother
was
present
on
these
occasions
rowland
saw
him
little
at
other
times
and
for
three
weeks
no
observations
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
of
hudson
s
advent
to
rowland
s
vision
as
the
weeks
elapsed
the
benefits
to
proceed
from
the
presence
of
the
two
ladies
remained
shrouded
in
mystery
roderick
was
peculiarly
inscrutable
he
was
preoccupied
with
his
work
on
his
mother
s
portrait
which
was
taking
a
very
happy
turn
and
often
when
he
sat
silent
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
legs
outstretched
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
on
vacancy
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
his
fancy
was
hovering
about
the
image
in
his
studio
exquisite
even
in
its
immaturity
he
said
little
but
his
silence
did
not
of
necessity
imply
disaffection
for
he
evidently
found
it
a
deep
personal
luxury
to
lounge
away
the
hours
in
an
atmosphere
so
charged
with
feminine
tenderness
he
was
not
alert
he
suggested
nothing
in
the
way
of
excursions
rowland
was
the
prime
mover
in
such
as
were
attempted
but
he
conformed
passively
at
least
to
the
tranquil
temper
of
the
two
women
and
made
no
harsh
comments
nor
sombre
allusions
rowland
wondered
whether
he
had
after
all
done
his
friend
injustice
in
denying
him
the
sentiment
of
duty
he
refused
invitations
to
rowland
s
knowledge
in
order
to
dine
at
the
jejune
little
hote
wherever
his
spirit
might
be
he
was
present
in
the
flesh
with
religious
constancy
hudson
s
felicity
betrayed
itself
in
a
remarkable
tendency
to
finish
her
sentences
and
wear
her
best
black
silk
gown
her
tremors
had
trembled
away
she
was
like
a
child
who
discovers
that
the
shaggy
monster
it
has
so
long
been
afraid
to
touch
is
an
inanimate
terror
compounded
of
straw
and
and
that
it
is
even
a
safe
audacity
to
tickle
its
nose
as
to
whether
the
of
which
mary
garland
had
the
keeping
still
held
firm
who
should
pronounce
the
young
girl
as
we
know
did
not
wear
it
on
her
sleeve
she
always
sat
at
the
table
near
the
candles
with
a
piece
of
this
was
the
attitude
in
which
rowland
had
first
seen
her
and
he
thought
now
that
he
had
seen
her
in
several
others
it
was
not
the
least
becoming
chapter
x
the
cavaliere
there
befell
at
last
a
couple
of
days
during
which
rowland
was
unable
to
go
to
the
hotel
late
in
the
evening
of
the
second
one
roderick
came
into
his
room
in
a
few
moments
he
announced
that
he
had
finished
the
bust
of
his
mother
and
it
s
magnificent
he
declared
it
s
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
i
believe
it
said
rowland
never
again
talk
to
me
about
your
inspiration
being
why
not
this
may
be
its
last
kick
i
feel
very
tired
but
it
s
a
masterpiece
though
i
do
say
it
they
tell
us
we
owe
so
much
to
our
parents
well
i
ve
paid
the
filial
debt
handsomely
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
a
few
moments
with
the
purpose
of
his
visit
evidently
still
undischarged
there
s
one
thing
more
i
want
to
say
he
presently
resumed
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
tell
you
he
stopped
before
rowland
with
his
head
high
and
his
brilliant
glance
unclouded
your
invention
is
a
failure
my
invention
rowland
repeated
bringing
out
my
mother
and
a
failure
it
s
no
use
they
don
t
help
rowland
had
fancied
that
roderick
had
no
more
surprises
for
him
but
he
was
now
staring
at
him
they
bore
me
roderick
went
on
oh
oh
cried
rowland
listen
listen
said
roderick
with
perfect
gentleness
i
am
not
complaining
of
them
i
am
simply
stating
a
fact
i
am
very
sorry
for
them
i
am
greatly
have
you
given
them
a
fair
trial
should
n
t
you
say
so
it
seems
to
me
i
have
behaved
you
have
done
very
well
i
have
been
building
great
hopes
on
i
have
done
too
well
then
after
the
first
hours
my
own
hopes
collapsed
but
i
determined
to
fight
it
out
to
stand
within
the
temple
to
let
the
spirit
of
the
lord
descend
do
you
want
to
know
the
result
another
week
of
it
and
i
shall
begin
to
hate
them
i
shall
want
to
poison
miserable
boy
cried
rowland
they
are
the
loveliest
of
women
very
likely
but
they
mean
no
more
to
me
than
a
bible
text
to
an
atheist
i
utterly
fail
said
rowland
in
a
moment
to
understand
your
relation
to
miss
roderick
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
let
his
hands
drop
at
his
sides
she
adores
me
that
s
my
and
he
smiled
strangely
have
you
broken
your
engagement
broken
it
you
can
t
break
a
ray
of
have
you
absolutely
no
affection
for
her
roderick
placed
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
held
it
there
a
moment
dead
dead
dead
he
said
at
last
i
wonder
rowland
asked
presently
if
you
begin
to
comprehend
the
beauty
of
miss
garland
s
character
she
is
a
person
of
the
highest
evidently
or
i
would
not
have
cared
for
her
has
that
no
charm
for
you
now
oh
don
t
force
a
fellow
to
say
rude
things
well
i
can
only
say
that
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
giving
roderick
gave
a
quickened
glance
do
you
know
so
well
i
admire
her
roderick
smiled
we
may
almost
say
sympathetically
you
have
not
wasted
rowland
s
thoughts
were
crowding
upon
him
fast
if
roderick
was
resolute
why
oppose
him
if
mary
was
to
be
sacrificed
why
in
that
way
try
to
save
her
there
was
another
way
it
only
needed
a
little
presumption
to
make
it
possible
rowland
tried
mentally
to
summon
presumption
to
his
aid
but
whether
it
came
or
not
it
found
conscience
there
before
it
conscience
had
only
three
words
but
they
were
cogent
for
her
sake
for
her
sake
it
dumbly
murmured
and
rowland
resumed
his
argument
i
don
t
know
what
i
would
n
t
do
he
said
rather
than
that
miss
garland
should
there
is
one
thing
to
be
said
roderick
answered
reflectively
she
is
very
well
then
if
she
s
strong
believe
that
with
a
longer
chance
a
better
chance
she
will
still
regain
your
do
you
know
what
you
ask
cried
roderick
make
love
to
a
girl
i
hate
you
hate
as
her
lover
i
should
hate
her
listen
to
me
said
rowland
with
vehemence
no
listen
you
to
me
do
you
really
urge
my
marrying
a
woman
who
would
bore
me
to
death
i
would
let
her
know
it
in
very
good
season
and
then
where
would
she
be
rowland
walked
the
length
of
the
room
a
couple
of
times
and
then
stopped
suddenly
go
your
way
then
say
all
this
to
her
not
to
me
to
her
i
am
afraid
of
her
i
want
you
to
help
my
dear
roderick
said
rowland
with
an
eloquent
smile
i
can
help
you
no
more
roderick
frowned
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
took
his
hat
oh
well
he
said
i
am
not
so
afraid
of
her
as
all
that
and
he
turned
as
if
to
depart
stop
cried
rowland
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
door
roderick
paused
and
stood
waiting
with
his
irritated
brow
come
back
sit
down
there
and
listen
to
me
of
anything
you
were
to
say
in
your
present
state
of
mind
you
would
live
most
bitterly
to
repent
you
don
t
know
what
you
really
think
you
don
t
know
what
you
really
feel
you
don
t
know
your
own
mind
you
don
t
do
justice
to
miss
garland
all
this
is
impossible
here
under
these
circumstances
you
re
blind
you
re
deaf
you
re
under
a
spell
to
break
it
you
must
leave
leave
rome
rome
was
never
so
dear
to
that
s
not
of
the
smallest
consequence
leave
it
and
where
shall
i
go
go
to
some
place
where
you
may
be
alone
with
your
mother
and
miss
alone
you
will
not
come
oh
if
you
desire
it
i
will
roderick
inclining
his
head
a
little
looked
at
his
friend
askance
i
don
t
understand
you
he
said
i
wish
you
liked
miss
garland
either
a
little
less
or
a
little
rowland
felt
himself
coloring
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
roderick
s
speech
you
ask
me
to
help
you
he
went
on
on
these
present
conditions
i
can
do
nothing
but
if
you
will
postpone
all
decision
as
to
the
continuance
of
your
engagement
a
couple
of
months
longer
and
meanwhile
leave
rome
leave
italy
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
as
you
say
in
the
event
of
your
still
wishing
to
break
i
must
do
without
your
help
then
your
conditions
are
impossible
i
will
leave
rome
at
the
time
i
have
always
intended
at
the
end
of
june
my
rooms
and
my
mother
s
are
taken
till
then
all
my
arrangements
are
made
accordingly
then
i
will
depart
not
you
are
not
frank
said
rowland
your
real
reason
for
staying
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
roderick
s
face
betrayed
neither
embarrassment
nor
resentment
if
i
m
not
frank
it
s
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
since
you
know
so
much
about
my
real
reason
let
me
hear
it
no
stop
he
suddenly
added
i
won
t
trouble
you
you
are
right
i
have
a
motive
on
the
of
june
miss
light
is
to
be
married
i
take
an
immense
interest
in
all
that
concerns
her
and
i
wish
to
be
present
at
her
but
you
said
the
other
day
at
saint
peter
s
that
it
was
by
no
means
certain
her
marriage
would
take
apparently
i
was
wrong
the
invitations
i
am
told
are
going
rowland
felt
that
it
would
be
utterly
vain
to
remonstrate
and
that
the
only
thing
for
him
was
to
make
the
best
terms
possible
if
i
offer
no
further
opposition
to
your
waiting
for
miss
light
s
marriage
he
said
will
you
promise
meanwhile
and
afterwards
for
a
certain
period
to
defer
to
my
judgment
to
say
nothing
that
may
be
a
cause
of
suffering
to
miss
garland
for
a
certain
period
what
period
roderick
demanded
ah
don
t
drive
so
close
a
bargain
don
t
you
understand
that
i
have
taken
you
away
from
her
that
i
suffer
in
every
nerve
in
consequence
and
that
i
must
do
what
i
can
to
restore
you
do
what
you
can
then
said
roderick
gravely
putting
out
his
hand
do
what
you
can
his
tone
and
his
seemed
to
constitute
a
promise
and
upon
this
they
parted
roderick
s
bust
of
his
mother
whether
or
no
it
was
a
discharge
of
what
he
called
the
filial
debt
was
at
least
a
most
admirable
production
rowland
at
the
time
it
was
finished
met
gloriani
one
evening
and
this
unscrupulous
genius
immediately
began
to
ask
questions
about
it
i
am
told
our
friend
has
come
down
he
said
he
has
been
doing
a
queer
little
old
a
queer
little
old
woman
rowland
exclaimed
my
dear
sir
she
is
hudson
s
all
the
more
reason
for
her
being
queer
it
is
a
bust
for
eh
by
no
means
it
is
for
that
s
a
pity
it
was
described
to
me
as
a
charming
piece
of
quaintness
a
little
demure
old
lady
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
the
prettiest
wrinkles
in
the
world
a
sort
of
fairy
go
and
see
it
and
judge
for
yourself
said
rowland
no
i
see
i
shall
be
disappointed
it
s
quite
the
other
thing
the
sort
of
thing
they
put
into
the
i
wish
that
boy
would
listen
to
me
an
hour
but
a
day
or
two
later
rowland
met
him
again
in
the
street
and
as
they
were
near
proposed
they
should
adjourn
to
roderick
s
studio
he
consented
and
on
entering
they
found
the
young
master
roderick
s
demeanor
to
gloriani
was
never
conciliatory
and
on
this
occasion
supreme
indifference
was
apparently
all
he
had
to
offer
but
gloriani
like
a
genuine
connoisseur
cared
nothing
for
his
manners
he
cared
only
for
his
skill
in
the
bust
of
hudson
there
was
something
almost
touching
it
was
an
exquisite
example
of
a
ruling
sense
of
beauty
the
poor
lady
s
small
neat
timorous
face
had
certainly
no
great
character
but
roderick
had
reproduced
its
sweetness
its
mildness
its
minuteness
its
still
maternal
passion
with
the
most
unerring
art
it
was
perfectly
unflattered
and
yet
admirably
tender
it
was
the
poetry
of
fidelity
gloriani
stood
looking
at
it
a
long
time
most
intently
roderick
wandered
away
into
the
neighboring
room
i
give
it
up
said
the
sculptor
at
last
i
don
t
understand
but
you
like
it
said
rowland
like
it
it
s
a
pearl
of
pearls
tell
me
this
he
added
is
he
very
fond
of
his
mother
is
he
a
very
good
son
and
he
gave
rowland
a
sharp
look
why
she
adores
him
said
rowland
smiling
that
s
not
an
answer
but
it
s
none
of
my
business
only
if
i
in
his
place
being
suspected
of
having
what
shall
i
call
it
a
cold
heart
managed
to
do
that
piece
of
work
oh
oh
i
should
be
called
a
pretty
lot
of
names
charlatan
poseur
arrangeur
but
he
can
do
as
he
chooses
my
dear
young
man
i
know
you
don
t
like
me
he
went
on
as
roderick
came
back
it
s
a
pity
you
are
strong
enough
not
to
care
about
me
at
all
you
are
very
not
at
all
said
roderick
curtly
i
am
very
weak
i
told
you
last
year
that
you
would
n
t
keep
it
up
i
was
a
great
ass
you
will
i
beg
your
pardon
i
won
t
retorted
roderick
though
i
m
a
great
ass
all
the
same
eh
well
call
me
what
you
will
so
long
as
you
turn
out
this
sort
of
thing
i
don
t
suppose
it
makes
any
particular
difference
but
i
should
like
to
say
now
i
believe
in
roderick
stood
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
hardness
in
his
face
it
flushed
slowly
and
two
glittering
angry
tears
filled
his
eyes
it
was
the
first
time
rowland
had
ever
seen
them
there
he
saw
them
but
once
again
poor
gloriani
he
was
sure
had
never
in
his
life
spoken
with
less
of
irony
but
to
roderick
there
was
evidently
a
sense
of
mockery
in
his
profession
of
faith
he
turned
away
with
a
muttered
passionate
imprecation
gloriani
was
accustomed
to
deal
with
complex
problems
but
this
time
he
was
hopelessly
puzzled
what
s
the
matter
with
him
he
asked
simply
rowland
gave
a
sad
smile
and
touched
his
forehead
genius
i
gloriani
sent
another
parting
lingering
look
at
the
bust
of
hudson
well
it
s
deuced
perfect
it
s
deuced
simple
i
do
believe
in
him
he
said
but
i
m
glad
i
m
not
a
genius
it
makes
he
added
with
a
laugh
as
he
looked
for
roderick
to
wave
him
and
saw
his
back
still
turned
it
makes
a
more
sociable
rowland
had
purchased
as
he
supposed
temporary
tranquillity
for
mary
garland
but
his
own
humor
in
these
days
was
not
especially
peaceful
he
was
attempting
in
a
certain
sense
to
lead
the
ideal
life
and
he
found
it
at
the
least
not
easy
the
days
passed
but
brought
with
them
no
official
invitation
to
miss
light
s
wedding
he
occasionally
met
her
and
he
occasionally
met
prince
casamassima
but
always
separately
never
together
they
were
apparently
taking
their
happiness
in
the
inexpressive
manner
proper
to
people
of
social
eminence
rowland
continued
to
see
madame
grandoni
for
whom
he
felt
a
confirmed
affection
he
had
always
talked
to
her
with
frankness
but
now
he
made
her
a
confidant
of
all
his
hidden
dejection
roderick
and
roderick
s
concerns
had
been
a
common
theme
with
him
and
it
was
in
the
natural
course
to
talk
of
hudson
s
arrival
and
miss
garland
s
fine
smile
madame
grandoni
was
an
intelligent
listener
and
she
lost
no
time
in
putting
his
case
for
him
in
a
nutshell
at
one
moment
you
tell
me
the
girl
is
plain
she
said
the
next
you
tell
me
she
s
pretty
i
will
invite
them
and
i
shall
see
for
myself
but
one
thing
is
very
clear
you
are
in
love
with
rowland
for
all
answer
glanced
round
to
see
that
no
one
heard
her
more
than
that
she
added
you
have
been
in
love
with
her
these
two
years
there
was
that
certain
something
about
you
i
knew
you
were
a
mild
sweet
fellow
but
you
had
a
touch
of
it
more
than
was
natural
why
did
n
t
you
tell
me
at
once
you
would
have
saved
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
poor
augusta
blanchard
too
and
herewith
madame
grandoni
communicated
a
pertinent
fact
augusta
blanchard
and
leavenworth
were
going
to
make
a
match
the
young
lady
had
been
staying
for
a
month
at
albano
and
leavenworth
had
been
dancing
attendance
the
event
was
a
matter
of
course
rowland
who
had
been
lately
reproaching
himself
with
a
failure
of
attention
to
miss
blanchard
s
doings
made
some
such
observation
but
you
did
not
find
it
so
cried
his
hostess
it
was
a
matter
of
course
perhaps
that
leavenworth
who
seems
to
be
going
about
europe
with
the
sole
view
of
picking
up
furniture
for
his
home
as
he
calls
it
should
think
miss
blanchard
a
very
handsome
piece
but
it
was
not
a
matter
of
course
or
it
need
n
t
have
been
that
she
should
be
willing
to
become
a
sort
of
superior
she
would
have
accepted
you
if
you
had
you
are
supposing
the
insupposable
said
rowland
she
never
gave
me
a
particle
of
what
would
you
have
had
her
do
the
poor
girl
did
her
best
and
i
am
sure
that
when
she
accepted
leavenworth
she
thought
of
she
thought
of
the
pleasure
her
marriage
would
give
ay
pleasure
indeed
she
is
a
thoroughly
good
girl
but
she
has
her
little
grain
of
feminine
spite
like
the
rest
well
he
s
richer
than
you
and
she
will
have
what
she
wants
but
before
i
forgive
you
i
must
wait
and
see
this
new
arrival
what
do
you
call
her
miss
garland
if
i
like
her
i
will
forgive
you
if
i
don
t
i
shall
always
bear
you
a
rowland
answered
that
he
was
sorry
to
forfeit
any
advantage
she
might
offer
him
but
that
his
exculpatory
passion
for
miss
garland
was
a
figment
of
her
fancy
miss
garland
was
engaged
to
another
man
and
he
himself
had
no
claims
well
then
said
madame
grandoni
if
i
like
her
we
ll
have
it
that
you
ought
to
be
in
love
with
her
if
you
fail
in
this
it
will
be
a
double
misdemeanor
the
man
she
s
engaged
to
does
n
t
care
a
straw
for
her
leave
me
alone
and
i
ll
tell
her
what
i
think
of
as
to
christina
light
s
marriage
madame
grandoni
could
make
no
definite
statement
the
young
girl
of
late
had
made
her
several
flying
visits
in
the
intervals
of
the
usual
shopping
and
she
had
spoken
of
the
event
with
a
toss
of
her
head
as
a
matter
which
with
a
wise
old
friend
who
viewed
things
in
their
essence
she
need
not
pretend
to
treat
as
a
solemnity
it
was
for
prince
casamassima
to
do
that
it
is
what
they
call
a
marriage
of
reason
she
once
said
that
means
you
know
a
marriage
of
madness
what
have
you
said
in
the
way
of
advice
rowland
asked
very
little
but
that
little
has
favored
the
prince
i
know
nothing
of
the
mysteries
of
the
young
lady
s
heart
it
may
be
a
but
at
any
rate
it
s
a
mine
and
it
s
a
long
journey
down
into
it
but
the
marriage
in
itself
is
an
excellent
marriage
it
s
not
only
brilliant
but
it
s
safe
i
think
christina
is
quite
capable
of
making
it
a
means
of
misery
but
there
is
no
position
that
would
be
sacred
to
her
casamassima
is
an
irreproachable
young
man
there
is
nothing
against
him
but
that
he
is
a
prince
it
is
not
often
i
fancy
that
a
prince
has
been
put
through
his
paces
at
this
rate
no
one
knows
the
the
cards
of
invitation
have
been
printed
half
a
dozen
times
over
with
a
different
date
each
time
christina
has
destroyed
them
there
are
people
in
rome
who
are
furious
at
the
delay
they
want
to
get
away
they
are
in
a
dreadful
fright
about
the
fever
but
they
are
dying
to
see
the
wedding
and
if
the
day
were
fixed
they
would
make
their
arrangements
to
wait
for
it
i
think
it
very
possible
that
after
having
kept
them
a
month
and
produced
a
dozen
cases
of
malaria
christina
will
be
married
at
midnight
by
an
old
friar
with
simply
the
legal
it
is
true
then
that
she
has
become
a
catholic
so
she
tells
me
one
day
she
got
up
in
the
depths
of
despair
at
her
wit
s
end
i
suppose
in
other
words
for
a
new
sensation
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
catholic
church
might
after
all
hold
the
key
might
give
her
what
she
wanted
she
sent
for
a
priest
he
happened
to
be
a
clever
man
and
he
contrived
to
interest
her
she
put
on
a
black
dress
and
a
black
lace
veil
and
looking
handsomer
than
ever
she
rustled
into
the
catholic
church
the
prince
who
is
very
devout
and
who
had
her
heresy
sorely
on
his
conscience
was
thrown
into
an
ecstasy
may
she
never
have
a
caprice
that
pleases
him
less
rowland
had
already
asked
madame
grandoni
what
to
her
perception
was
the
present
state
of
matters
between
christina
and
roderick
and
he
now
repeated
his
question
with
some
earnestness
of
apprehension
the
girl
is
so
deucedly
dramatic
he
said
that
i
don
t
know
what
coup
de
theatre
she
may
have
in
store
for
us
such
a
stroke
was
her
turning
catholic
such
a
stroke
would
be
her
some
day
making
her
courtesy
to
a
disappointed
world
as
princess
casamassima
married
at
midnight
in
her
bonnet
she
might
do
she
may
do
something
that
would
make
even
more
starers
i
m
prepared
for
you
mean
that
she
might
elope
with
your
sculptor
eh
i
m
prepared
for
anything
do
you
mean
that
he
s
ready
do
you
think
that
she
is
they
re
a
precious
pair
i
think
this
you
by
no
means
exhaust
the
subject
when
you
say
that
christina
is
dramatic
it
s
my
belief
that
in
the
course
of
her
life
she
will
do
a
certain
number
of
things
from
pure
disinterested
passion
she
s
immeasurably
proud
and
if
that
is
often
a
fault
in
a
virtuous
person
it
may
be
a
merit
in
a
vicious
one
she
needs
to
think
well
of
herself
she
knows
a
fine
character
easily
when
she
meets
one
she
hates
to
suffer
by
comparison
even
though
the
comparison
is
made
by
herself
alone
and
when
the
estimate
she
may
have
made
of
herself
grows
vague
she
needs
to
do
something
to
give
it
definite
impressive
form
what
she
will
do
in
such
a
case
will
be
better
or
worse
according
to
her
opportunity
but
i
imagine
it
will
generally
be
something
that
will
drive
her
mother
to
despair
something
of
the
sort
usually
termed
rowland
as
he
was
taking
his
leave
after
some
further
exchange
of
opinions
rendered
miss
light
the
tribute
of
a
deeply
meditative
sigh
she
has
bothered
me
half
to
death
he
said
but
somehow
i
can
t
manage
as
i
ought
to
hate
her
i
admire
her
half
the
time
and
a
good
part
of
the
rest
i
pity
i
think
i
most
pity
her
said
madame
grandoni
this
enlightened
woman
came
the
next
day
to
call
upon
the
two
ladies
from
northampton
she
carried
their
shy
affections
by
storm
and
made
them
promise
to
drink
tea
with
her
on
the
evening
of
the
morrow
her
visit
was
an
era
in
the
life
of
poor
hudson
who
did
nothing
but
make
sudden
desultory
allusions
to
her
for
the
next
hours
to
think
of
her
being
a
foreigner
she
would
exclaim
after
much
intent
reflection
over
her
knitting
she
speaks
so
beautifully
then
in
a
little
while
she
was
n
t
so
much
dressed
as
you
might
have
expected
did
you
notice
how
easy
it
was
in
the
waist
i
wonder
if
that
s
the
fashion
or
she
s
very
old
to
wear
a
hat
i
should
never
dare
to
wear
a
hat
or
did
you
notice
her
hands
very
pretty
hands
for
such
a
stout
person
a
great
many
rings
but
nothing
very
handsome
i
suppose
they
are
or
she
s
certainly
not
handsome
but
she
s
very
i
wonder
why
she
does
n
t
have
something
done
to
her
rowland
also
received
a
summons
to
madame
grandoni
s
and
went
betimes
as
he
had
been
requested
he
was
eagerly
desirous
to
lend
his
mute
applause
to
mary
garland
s
debut
in
the
roman
social
world
the
two
ladies
had
arrived
with
roderick
silent
and
careless
in
attendance
miss
blanchard
was
also
present
escorted
by
leavenworth
and
the
party
was
completed
by
a
dozen
artists
of
both
sexes
and
various
nationalities
it
was
a
friendly
and
easy
assembly
like
all
madame
grandoni
s
parties
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
there
was
some
excellent
music
people
played
and
sang
for
madame
grandoni
on
easy
terms
who
elsewhere
were
not
to
be
heard
for
the
asking
she
was
herself
a
superior
musician
and
singers
found
it
a
privilege
to
perform
to
her
accompaniment
rowland
talked
to
various
persons
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
attention
visibly
wandered
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
mary
garland
madame
grandoni
had
said
that
he
sometimes
spoke
of
her
as
pretty
and
sometimes
as
plain
if
he
had
had
occasion
to
describe
her
appearance
he
would
have
called
her
beautiful
she
was
dressed
more
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
it
was
becoming
and
gave
her
a
deeper
color
and
an
ampler
presence
two
or
three
persons
were
introduced
to
her
who
were
apparently
witty
people
for
she
sat
listening
to
them
with
her
brilliant
natural
smile
rowland
from
an
opposite
corner
reflected
that
he
had
never
varied
in
his
appreciation
of
miss
blanchard
s
classic
contour
but
that
somehow
it
impressed
him
hardly
more
than
an
effigy
stamped
upon
a
coin
of
low
value
roderick
could
not
be
accused
of
rancor
for
he
had
approached
leavenworth
with
unstudied
familiarity
and
lounging
against
the
wall
with
hands
in
pockets
was
discoursing
to
him
with
candid
serenity
now
that
he
had
done
him
an
impertinence
he
evidently
found
him
less
intolerable
leavenworth
stood
stirring
his
tea
and
silently
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
without
looking
at
the
young
sculptor
like
a
large
drowsy
dog
snapping
at
flies
rowland
had
found
it
disagreeable
to
be
told
miss
blanchard
would
have
married
him
for
the
asking
and
he
would
have
felt
some
embarrassment
in
going
to
speak
to
her
if
his
modesty
had
not
found
incredulity
so
easy
the
facile
side
of
a
union
with
miss
blanchard
had
never
been
present
to
his
mind
it
had
struck
him
as
a
thing
in
all
ways
to
be
compassed
with
a
great
effort
he
had
half
an
hour
s
talk
with
her
a
farewell
talk
as
it
seemed
to
him
a
farewell
not
to
a
real
illusion
but
to
the
idea
that
for
him
in
that
matter
there
could
ever
be
an
acceptable
he
congratulated
miss
blanchard
upon
her
engagement
and
she
received
his
compliment
with
a
touch
of
primness
but
she
was
always
a
trifle
prim
even
when
she
was
quoting
browning
and
george
sand
and
this
harmless
defect
did
not
prevent
her
responding
on
this
occasion
that
leavenworth
had
a
glorious
rowland
wished
to
manifest
an
extreme
regard
but
toward
the
end
of
the
talk
his
zeal
relaxed
and
he
fell
that
a
certain
natural
ease
in
a
woman
was
the
most
delightful
thing
in
the
world
there
was
christina
light
who
had
too
much
and
here
was
miss
blanchard
who
had
too
little
and
there
was
mary
garland
in
whom
the
quality
was
wholly
uncultivated
who
had
just
the
right
amount
he
went
to
madame
grandoni
in
an
adjoining
room
where
she
was
pouring
out
tea
i
will
make
you
an
excellent
cup
she
said
because
i
have
forgiven
he
looked
at
her
answering
nothing
but
he
swallowed
his
tea
with
great
gusto
and
a
slight
deepening
of
his
color
by
all
of
which
one
would
have
known
that
he
was
gratified
in
a
moment
he
intimated
that
in
so
far
as
he
had
sinned
he
had
forgiven
himself
she
is
a
lovely
girl
said
madame
grandoni
there
is
a
great
deal
there
i
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
and
she
must
let
me
make
a
friend
of
she
is
very
plain
said
rowland
slowly
very
simple
very
which
being
interpreted
means
she
is
very
handsome
very
subtle
and
has
read
hundreds
of
volumes
on
winter
evenings
in
the
you
are
a
veritable
sorceress
cried
rowland
you
frighten
me
away
as
he
was
turning
to
leave
her
there
rose
above
the
hum
of
voices
in
the
the
sharp
grotesque
note
of
a
barking
dog
their
eyes
met
in
a
glance
of
intelligence
there
is
the
sorceress
said
madame
grandoni
the
sorceress
and
her
necromantic
poodle
and
she
hastened
back
to
the
post
of
hospitality
rowland
followed
her
and
found
christina
light
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
and
looking
about
in
perplexity
her
poodle
sitting
on
his
haunches
and
gazing
at
the
company
had
apparently
been
expressing
a
sympathetic
displeasure
at
the
absence
of
a
welcome
but
in
a
moment
madame
grandoni
had
come
to
the
young
girl
s
relief
and
christina
had
tenderly
kissed
her
i
had
no
idea
said
christina
surveying
the
assembly
that
you
had
such
a
lot
of
grand
people
or
i
would
not
have
come
in
the
servant
said
nothing
he
took
me
for
an
invitee
i
came
to
spend
a
neighborly
you
know
i
have
n
t
many
left
it
was
too
dismally
dreary
at
home
i
hoped
i
should
find
you
alone
and
i
brought
stenterello
to
play
with
the
cat
i
don
t
know
that
if
i
had
known
about
all
this
i
would
have
dared
to
come
in
but
since
i
ve
stumbled
into
the
midst
of
it
i
beg
you
ll
let
me
stay
i
am
not
dressed
but
am
i
very
hideous
i
will
sit
in
a
corner
and
no
one
will
notice
me
my
dear
sweet
lady
do
let
me
stay
pray
why
did
n
t
you
ask
me
i
never
have
been
to
a
little
party
like
this
they
must
be
very
charming
no
dancing
tea
and
conversation
no
tea
thank
you
but
if
you
could
spare
a
biscuit
for
stenterello
a
sweet
biscuit
please
really
why
did
n
t
you
ask
me
do
you
have
these
things
often
madame
grandoni
it
s
very
unkind
and
the
young
girl
who
had
delivered
herself
of
the
foregoing
succession
of
sentences
in
her
usual
low
cool
penetrating
voice
uttered
these
last
words
with
a
certain
tremor
of
feeling
i
see
she
went
on
i
do
very
well
for
balls
and
great
banquets
but
when
people
wish
to
have
a
cosy
friendly
comfortable
evening
they
leave
me
out
with
the
big
and
the
gilt
i
m
sure
you
re
welcome
to
stay
my
dear
said
madame
grandoni
and
at
the
risk
of
displeasing
you
i
must
confess
that
if
i
did
n
t
invite
you
it
was
because
you
re
too
grand
your
dress
will
do
very
well
with
its
fifty
flounces
and
there
is
no
need
of
your
going
into
a
corner
indeed
since
you
re
here
i
propose
to
have
the
glory
of
it
you
must
remain
where
my
people
can
see
they
are
evidently
determined
to
do
that
by
the
way
they
stare
do
they
think
i
intend
to
dance
a
tarantella
who
are
they
all
do
i
know
them
and
lingering
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
arm
passed
into
madame
grandoni
s
she
let
her
eyes
wander
slowly
from
group
to
group
they
were
of
course
observing
her
standing
in
the
little
circle
of
lamplight
with
the
hood
of
an
eastern
burnous
shot
with
silver
threads
falling
back
from
her
beautiful
head
one
hand
gathering
together
its
voluminous
shimmering
folds
and
the
other
playing
with
the
silken
on
the
uplifted
head
of
her
poodle
she
was
a
figure
of
radiant
picturesqueness
she
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
extemporized
tableau
vivant
rowland
s
position
made
it
becoming
for
him
to
speak
to
her
without
delay
as
she
looked
at
him
he
saw
that
judging
by
the
light
of
her
beautiful
eyes
she
was
in
a
humor
of
which
she
had
not
yet
treated
him
to
a
specimen
in
a
simpler
person
he
would
have
called
it
exquisite
kindness
but
in
this
young
lady
s
deportment
the
flower
was
one
thing
and
the
perfume
another
tell
me
about
these
people
she
said
to
him
i
had
no
idea
there
were
so
many
people
in
rome
i
had
not
seen
what
are
they
all
talking
about
it
s
all
beyond
me
i
suppose
there
is
miss
blanchard
sitting
as
usual
in
profile
against
a
dark
object
she
is
like
a
head
on
a
and
there
is
that
nice
little
old
lady
in
black
hudson
what
a
dear
little
woman
for
a
mother
comme
elle
est
proprette
and
the
other
the
fiancee
of
course
she
s
here
ah
i
see
she
paused
she
was
looking
intently
at
miss
garland
rowland
measured
the
intentness
of
her
glance
and
suddenly
acquired
a
firm
conviction
i
should
like
so
much
to
know
her
she
said
turning
to
madame
grandoni
she
has
a
charming
face
i
am
sure
she
s
an
angel
i
wish
very
much
you
would
introduce
me
no
on
second
thoughts
i
had
rather
you
did
n
t
i
will
speak
to
her
bravely
myself
as
a
friend
of
her
madame
grandoni
and
rowland
exchanged
glances
of
baffled
conjecture
and
christina
flung
off
her
burnous
crumpled
it
together
and
with
uplifted
finger
tossing
it
into
a
corner
gave
it
in
charge
to
her
poodle
he
stationed
himself
upon
it
on
his
haunches
with
upright
vigilance
christina
crossed
the
room
with
the
step
and
smile
of
a
ministering
angel
and
introduced
herself
to
mary
garland
she
had
once
told
rowland
that
she
would
show
him
some
day
how
gracious
her
manners
could
be
she
was
now
redeeming
her
promise
rowland
watching
her
saw
mary
garland
rise
slowly
in
response
to
her
greeting
and
look
at
her
with
serious
eyes
the
almost
dramatic
opposition
of
these
two
keenly
interesting
girls
touched
rowland
with
a
nameless
apprehension
and
after
a
moment
he
preferred
to
turn
away
in
doing
so
he
noticed
roderick
the
young
sculptor
was
standing
planted
on
the
train
of
a
lady
s
dress
gazing
across
at
christina
s
movements
with
undisguised
earnestness
there
were
several
more
pieces
of
music
rowland
sat
in
a
corner
and
listened
to
them
when
they
were
over
several
people
began
to
take
their
leave
hudson
among
the
number
rowland
saw
her
come
up
to
madame
grandoni
clinging
shyly
to
mary
garland
s
arm
miss
garland
had
a
brilliant
eye
and
a
deep
color
in
her
cheek
the
two
ladies
looked
about
for
roderick
but
roderick
had
his
back
turned
he
had
approached
christina
who
with
an
absent
air
was
sitting
alone
where
she
had
taken
her
place
near
miss
garland
looking
at
the
guests
pass
out
of
the
room
christina
s
eye
like
miss
garland
s
was
bright
but
her
cheek
was
pale
hearing
roderick
s
voice
she
looked
up
at
him
sharply
then
silently
with
a
single
quick
gesture
motioned
him
away
he
obeyed
her
and
came
and
joined
his
mother
in
bidding
good
night
to
madame
grandoni
christina
in
a
moment
met
rowland
s
glance
and
immediately
beckoned
him
to
come
to
her
he
was
familiar
with
her
spontaneity
of
movement
and
was
scarcely
surprised
she
made
a
place
for
him
on
the
sofa
beside
her
he
wondered
what
was
coming
now
he
was
not
sure
it
was
not
a
mere
fancy
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
just
as
she
was
looking
then
it
was
a
humble
touching
appealing
look
and
it
threw
into
wonderful
relief
the
nobleness
of
her
beauty
how
many
more
metamorphoses
he
asked
himself
am
i
to
be
treated
to
before
we
have
done
i
want
to
tell
you
said
christina
i
have
taken
an
immense
fancy
to
miss
garland
are
n
t
you
glad
delighted
exclaimed
poor
rowland
ah
you
don
t
believe
it
she
said
with
soft
dignity
is
it
so
hard
to
believe
not
that
people
in
general
should
admire
her
but
that
i
should
but
i
want
to
tell
you
i
want
to
tell
some
one
and
i
can
t
tell
miss
garland
herself
she
thinks
me
already
a
horrid
false
creature
and
if
i
were
to
express
to
her
frankly
what
i
think
of
her
i
should
simply
disgust
her
she
would
be
quite
right
she
has
repose
and
from
that
point
of
view
i
and
my
doings
must
seem
monstrous
unfortunately
i
have
n
t
repose
i
am
trembling
now
if
i
could
ask
you
to
feel
my
arm
you
would
see
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
admire
miss
garland
more
than
any
of
the
people
who
call
themselves
her
friends
except
of
course
you
oh
i
know
that
to
begin
with
she
is
extremely
handsome
and
she
does
n
t
know
she
is
not
generally
thought
handsome
said
rowland
evidently
that
s
the
vulgarity
of
the
human
mind
her
head
has
great
character
great
natural
style
if
a
woman
is
not
to
be
a
supreme
beauty
in
the
regular
way
she
will
choose
if
she
s
wise
to
look
like
that
she
ll
not
be
thought
pretty
by
people
in
general
and
desecrated
as
she
passes
by
the
stare
of
every
vile
wretch
who
chooses
to
thrust
his
nose
under
her
bonnet
but
a
certain
number
of
superior
people
will
find
it
one
of
the
delightful
things
of
life
to
look
at
her
that
lot
is
as
good
as
another
then
she
has
a
beautiful
character
you
found
that
out
soon
said
rowland
smiling
how
long
did
it
take
you
i
found
it
out
before
i
ever
spoke
to
her
i
met
her
the
other
day
in
saint
peter
s
i
knew
it
then
i
knew
it
do
you
want
to
know
how
long
i
have
known
it
really
said
rowland
i
did
n
t
mean
to
do
you
remember
mamma
s
ball
in
december
we
had
some
talk
and
you
then
mentioned
her
not
by
name
you
said
but
three
words
but
i
saw
you
admired
her
and
i
knew
that
if
you
admired
her
she
must
have
a
beautiful
character
that
s
what
you
require
upon
my
word
cried
rowland
you
make
three
words
go
very
far
oh
hudson
has
also
spoken
of
ah
that
s
better
said
rowland
i
don
t
know
he
does
n
t
like
did
he
tell
you
so
the
question
left
rowland
s
lips
before
he
could
stay
it
which
he
would
have
done
on
a
moment
s
reflection
christina
looked
at
him
intently
no
she
said
at
last
that
would
have
been
dishonorable
would
n
t
it
but
i
know
it
from
my
knowledge
of
him
he
does
n
t
like
perfection
he
is
not
bent
upon
being
safe
in
his
likings
he
s
willing
to
risk
something
poor
fellow
he
risks
too
much
rowland
was
silent
he
did
not
care
for
the
thrust
but
he
was
profoundly
mystified
christina
beckoned
to
her
poodle
and
the
dog
marched
stiffly
across
to
her
she
gave
a
loving
twist
to
his
and
bade
him
go
and
fetch
her
burnous
he
obeyed
gathered
it
up
in
his
teeth
and
returned
with
great
solemnity
dragging
it
along
the
floor
i
do
her
justice
i
do
her
full
justice
she
went
on
with
soft
earnestness
i
like
to
say
that
i
like
to
be
able
to
say
it
she
s
full
of
intelligence
and
courage
and
devotion
she
does
n
t
do
me
a
grain
of
justice
but
that
is
no
harm
there
is
something
so
fine
in
the
aversions
of
a
good
woman
if
you
would
give
miss
garland
a
chance
said
rowland
i
am
sure
she
would
be
glad
to
be
your
what
do
you
mean
by
a
chance
she
has
only
to
take
it
i
told
her
i
liked
her
immensely
and
she
frowned
as
if
i
had
said
something
disgusting
she
looks
very
handsome
when
she
christina
rose
with
these
words
and
began
to
gather
her
mantle
about
her
i
don
t
often
like
women
she
went
on
in
fact
i
generally
detest
them
but
i
should
like
to
know
miss
garland
well
i
should
like
to
have
a
friendship
with
her
i
have
never
had
one
they
must
be
very
delightful
but
i
shan
t
have
one
now
either
not
if
she
can
help
it
ask
her
what
she
thinks
of
me
see
what
she
will
say
i
don
t
want
to
know
keep
it
to
yourself
it
s
too
sad
so
we
go
through
life
it
s
fatality
that
s
what
they
call
it
is
n
t
it
we
please
the
people
we
don
t
care
for
we
displease
those
we
do
but
i
appreciate
her
i
do
her
justice
that
s
the
more
important
thing
it
s
because
i
have
imagination
she
has
none
never
mind
it
s
her
only
fault
i
do
her
justice
i
understand
very
she
kept
softly
murmuring
and
looking
about
for
madame
grandoni
she
saw
the
good
lady
near
the
door
and
put
out
her
hand
to
rowland
for
good
night
she
held
his
hand
an
instant
fixing
him
with
her
eyes
the
living
splendor
of
which
at
this
moment
was
something
transcendent
yes
i
do
her
justice
she
repeated
and
you
do
her
more
you
would
lay
down
your
life
for
with
this
she
turned
away
and
before
he
could
answer
she
left
him
she
went
to
madame
grandoni
grasped
her
two
hands
and
held
out
her
forehead
to
be
kissed
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
that
was
a
happy
accident
said
madame
grandoni
she
never
looked
so
beautiful
and
she
made
my
little
party
beautiful
verily
rowland
answered
but
it
was
no
what
was
it
then
it
was
a
plan
she
wished
to
see
miss
garland
she
knew
she
was
to
be
how
so
by
roderick
and
why
did
she
wish
to
see
miss
garland
heaven
knows
i
give
it
up
ah
the
wicked
girl
murmured
madame
grandoni
no
said
rowland
don
t
say
that
now
she
s
too
oh
you
men
the
best
of
you
well
then
cried
rowland
she
s
too
good
the
opportunity
presenting
itself
the
next
day
he
failed
not
as
you
may
imagine
to
ask
mary
garland
what
she
thought
of
miss
light
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
the
time
at
which
the
beautiful
marbles
of
the
villa
borghese
are
thrown
open
to
the
public
mary
had
told
him
that
roderick
had
promised
to
take
her
to
see
them
with
his
mother
and
he
joined
the
party
in
the
splendid
casino
the
warm
weather
had
left
so
few
strangers
in
rome
that
they
had
the
place
almost
to
themselves
hudson
had
confessed
to
an
invincible
fear
of
treading
even
with
the
help
of
her
son
s
arm
the
polished
marble
floors
and
was
sitting
patiently
on
a
stool
with
folded
hands
looking
shyly
here
and
there
at
the
undraped
paganism
around
her
roderick
had
sauntered
off
alone
with
an
irritated
brow
which
seemed
to
betray
the
conflict
between
the
instinct
of
observation
and
the
perplexities
of
circumstance
miss
garland
was
wandering
in
another
direction
and
though
she
was
consulting
her
catalogue
rowland
fancied
it
was
from
habit
she
too
was
preoccupied
he
joined
her
and
she
presently
sat
down
on
a
divan
rather
wearily
and
closed
her
murray
then
he
asked
her
abruptly
how
christina
had
pleased
her
she
started
the
least
bit
at
the
question
and
he
felt
that
she
had
been
thinking
of
christina
i
don
t
like
her
she
said
with
decision
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
think
she
s
this
was
said
without
petulance
or
bitterness
but
with
a
very
positive
air
but
she
wished
to
please
you
she
tried
rowland
rejoined
in
a
moment
i
think
not
she
wished
to
please
herself
rowland
felt
himself
at
liberty
to
say
no
more
no
allusion
to
christina
had
passed
between
them
since
the
day
they
met
her
at
saint
peter
s
but
he
knew
that
she
knew
by
that
infallible
sixth
sense
of
a
woman
who
loves
that
this
strange
beautiful
girl
had
the
power
to
injure
her
to
what
extent
she
had
the
will
mary
was
uncertain
but
last
night
s
interview
apparently
had
not
reassured
her
it
was
under
these
circumstances
equally
unbecoming
for
rowland
either
to
depreciate
or
to
defend
christina
and
he
had
to
content
himself
with
simply
having
verified
the
girl
s
own
assurance
that
she
had
made
a
bad
impression
he
tried
to
talk
of
indifferent
matters
about
the
statues
and
the
frescoes
but
plainly
aesthetic
curiosity
with
miss
garland
had
folded
its
wings
curiosity
of
another
sort
had
taken
its
place
mary
was
longing
he
was
sure
to
question
him
about
christina
but
she
found
a
dozen
reasons
for
hesitating
her
questions
would
imply
that
roderick
had
not
treated
her
with
confidence
for
information
on
this
point
should
properly
have
come
from
him
they
would
imply
that
she
was
jealous
and
to
betray
her
jealousy
was
intolerable
to
her
pride
for
some
minutes
as
she
sat
scratching
the
brilliant
pavement
with
the
point
of
her
umbrella
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
her
pride
and
her
anxiety
held
an
earnest
debate
at
last
anxiety
won
a
propos
of
miss
light
she
asked
do
you
know
her
well
i
can
hardly
say
that
but
i
have
seen
her
do
you
like
her
yes
and
no
i
think
i
am
sorry
for
mary
had
spoken
with
her
eyes
on
the
pavement
at
this
she
looked
up
sorry
for
her
why
well
she
is
what
are
her
misfortunes
well
she
has
a
horrible
mother
and
she
has
had
a
most
injurious
for
a
moment
miss
garland
was
silent
then
is
n
t
she
very
beautiful
she
asked
don
t
you
think
so
that
s
measured
by
what
men
think
she
is
extremely
clever
oh
she
has
beautiful
yes
any
number
of
and
beautiful
yes
and
plenty
of
money
enough
and
she
receives
great
very
and
she
is
to
marry
a
so
they
miss
garland
rose
and
turned
to
rejoin
her
companions
commenting
these
admissions
with
a
pregnant
silence
poor
miss
light
she
said
at
last
simply
and
in
this
it
seemed
to
rowland
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
very
late
on
the
following
evening
his
servant
brought
him
the
card
of
a
visitor
he
was
surprised
at
a
visit
at
such
an
hour
but
it
may
be
said
that
when
he
read
the
inscription
cavaliere
giuseppe
giacosa
his
surprise
declined
he
had
had
an
unformulated
conviction
that
there
was
to
be
a
sequel
to
the
apparition
at
madame
grandoni
s
the
cavaliere
had
come
to
usher
it
in
he
had
come
evidently
on
a
portentous
errand
he
was
as
pale
as
ashes
and
prodigiously
serious
his
little
cold
black
eye
had
grown
ardent
and
he
had
left
his
caressing
smile
at
home
he
saluted
rowland
however
with
his
usual
obsequious
bow
you
have
more
than
once
done
me
the
honor
to
invite
me
to
call
upon
you
he
said
i
am
ashamed
of
my
long
delay
and
i
can
only
say
to
you
frankly
that
my
time
this
winter
has
not
been
my
rowland
assented
ungrudgingly
fumbled
for
the
italian
correlative
of
the
adage
better
late
than
never
begged
him
to
be
seated
and
offered
him
a
cigar
the
cavaliere
sniffed
imperceptibly
the
fragrant
weed
and
then
declared
that
if
his
kind
host
would
allow
him
he
would
reserve
it
for
consumption
at
another
time
he
apparently
desired
to
intimate
that
the
solemnity
of
his
errand
left
him
no
breath
for
idle
rowland
stayed
himself
just
in
time
from
an
enthusiastic
offer
of
a
dozen
more
cigars
and
as
he
watched
the
cavaliere
stow
his
treasure
tenderly
away
in
his
reflected
that
only
an
italian
could
go
through
such
a
performance
with
uncompromised
dignity
i
must
confess
the
little
old
man
resumed
that
even
now
i
come
on
business
not
of
my
own
or
my
own
at
least
only
in
a
secondary
sense
i
have
been
dispatched
as
an
ambassador
an
envoy
extraordinary
i
may
say
by
my
dear
friend
if
i
can
in
any
way
be
of
service
to
light
i
shall
be
happy
rowland
said
well
then
dear
sir
casa
light
is
in
commotion
the
signora
is
in
trouble
in
terrible
for
a
moment
rowland
expected
to
hear
that
the
signora
s
trouble
was
of
a
nature
that
a
loan
of
five
thousand
francs
would
assuage
but
the
cavaliere
continued
miss
light
has
committed
a
great
crime
she
has
plunged
a
dagger
into
the
heart
of
her
a
dagger
cried
rowland
the
cavaliere
patted
the
air
an
instant
with
his
i
speak
figuratively
she
has
broken
off
her
broken
it
off
short
she
has
turned
the
prince
from
the
and
the
cavaliere
when
he
had
made
this
announcement
folded
his
arms
and
bent
upon
rowland
his
intense
inscrutable
gaze
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
he
detected
in
the
polished
depths
of
it
a
sort
of
fantastic
gleam
of
irony
or
of
triumph
but
superficially
at
least
giacosa
did
nothing
to
discredit
his
character
as
a
presumably
sympathetic
representative
of
light
s
affliction
rowland
heard
his
news
with
a
kind
of
fierce
disgust
it
seemed
the
sinister
counterpart
of
christina
s
preternatural
mildness
at
madame
grandoni
s
she
had
been
too
plausible
to
be
honest
without
being
able
to
trace
the
connection
he
yet
instinctively
associated
her
present
rebellion
with
her
meeting
with
mary
garland
if
she
had
not
seen
mary
she
would
have
let
things
stand
it
was
monstrous
to
suppose
that
she
could
have
sacrificed
so
brilliant
a
fortune
to
a
mere
movement
of
jealousy
to
a
refined
instinct
of
feminine
deviltry
to
a
desire
to
frighten
poor
mary
from
her
security
by
again
appearing
in
the
field
yet
rowland
remembered
his
first
impression
of
her
she
was
dangerous
and
she
had
measured
in
each
direction
the
perturbing
effect
of
her
rupture
she
was
smiling
her
sweetest
smile
at
it
for
half
an
hour
rowland
simply
detested
her
and
longed
to
denounce
her
to
her
face
of
course
all
he
could
say
to
giacosa
was
that
he
was
extremely
sorry
but
i
am
not
surprised
he
added
you
are
not
surprised
with
miss
light
everything
is
possible
is
n
t
that
true
another
ripple
seemed
to
play
for
an
instant
in
the
current
of
the
old
man
s
irony
but
he
waived
response
it
was
a
magnificent
marriage
he
said
solemnly
i
do
not
respect
many
people
but
i
respect
prince
i
should
judge
him
indeed
to
be
a
very
honorable
young
man
said
rowland
eh
young
as
he
is
he
s
made
of
the
old
stuff
and
now
perhaps
he
s
blowing
his
brains
out
he
is
the
last
of
his
house
it
s
a
great
house
but
miss
light
will
have
put
an
end
to
it
is
that
the
view
she
takes
of
it
rowland
ventured
to
ask
this
time
unmistakably
the
cavaliere
smiled
but
still
in
that
very
place
you
have
observed
miss
light
with
attention
he
said
and
this
brings
me
to
my
errand
light
has
a
high
opinion
of
your
wisdom
of
your
kindness
and
she
has
reason
to
believe
you
have
influence
with
her
i
with
her
daughter
not
a
grain
that
is
possibly
your
modesty
light
believes
that
something
may
yet
be
done
and
that
christina
will
listen
to
you
she
begs
you
to
come
and
see
her
before
it
is
too
but
all
this
my
dear
cavaliere
is
none
of
my
business
rowland
objected
i
can
t
possibly
in
such
a
matter
take
the
responsibility
of
advising
miss
the
cavaliere
fixed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
on
the
floor
in
brief
but
intense
reflection
then
looking
up
unfortunately
he
said
she
has
no
man
near
her
whom
she
respects
she
has
no
father
and
a
fatally
foolish
mother
rowland
gave
himself
the
satisfaction
of
exclaiming
the
cavaliere
was
so
pale
that
he
could
not
easily
have
turned
paler
yet
it
seemed
for
a
moment
that
his
dead
complexion
blanched
eh
signore
such
as
she
is
the
mother
appeals
to
you
a
very
handsome
woman
disheveled
in
tears
in
despair
in
dishabille
rowland
reflected
a
moment
not
on
the
attractions
of
light
under
the
circumstances
thus
indicated
by
the
cavaliere
but
on
the
satisfaction
he
would
take
in
accusing
christina
to
her
face
of
having
struck
a
cruel
blow
i
must
add
said
the
cavaliere
that
light
desires
also
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
of
she
considers
hudson
then
connected
with
this
step
of
her
daughter
s
intimately
he
must
be
got
out
of
mrs
light
then
must
get
an
order
from
the
pope
to
remove
him
it
s
not
in
my
the
cavaliere
assented
deferentially
mrs
light
is
equally
helpless
she
would
leave
rome
but
christina
will
not
budge
an
order
from
the
pope
would
do
nothing
a
bull
in
council
would
do
she
s
a
remarkable
young
lady
said
rowland
with
bitterness
but
the
cavaliere
rose
and
responded
coldly
she
has
a
great
and
it
seemed
to
rowland
that
her
great
spirit
for
mysterious
reasons
gave
him
more
pleasure
than
the
distressing
use
she
made
of
it
gave
him
pain
he
was
on
the
point
of
charging
him
with
his
inconsistency
when
giacosa
resumed
but
if
the
marriage
can
be
saved
it
must
be
saved
it
s
a
beautiful
marriage
it
will
be
notwithstanding
miss
light
s
great
spirit
to
the
contrary
miss
light
notwithstanding
her
great
spirit
will
call
prince
casamassima
heaven
grant
it
said
rowland
i
don
t
know
said
the
cavaliere
solemnly
that
heaven
will
have
much
to
do
with
rowland
gave
him
a
questioning
look
but
he
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
with
rowland
s
promise
to
present
himself
on
the
morrow
at
casa
light
he
shortly
afterwards
departed
he
left
rowland
revolving
many
things
christina
s
magnanimity
christina
s
perversity
roderick
s
contingent
fortune
mary
garland
s
certain
trouble
and
the
cavaliere
s
own
fine
ambiguities
rowland
s
promise
to
the
cavaliere
obliged
him
to
withdraw
from
an
excursion
which
he
had
arranged
with
the
two
ladies
from
northampton
before
going
to
casa
light
he
repaired
in
person
to
hudson
s
hotel
to
make
his
excuses
he
found
roderick
s
mother
sitting
with
tearful
eyes
staring
at
an
open
note
that
lay
in
her
lap
at
the
window
sat
miss
garland
who
turned
her
intense
regard
upon
him
as
he
came
in
hudson
quickly
rose
and
came
to
him
holding
out
the
note
in
pity
s
name
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
with
my
boy
if
he
is
ill
i
entreat
you
to
take
me
to
him
he
is
not
ill
to
my
knowledge
said
rowland
what
have
you
there
a
note
a
dreadful
note
he
tells
us
we
are
not
to
see
him
for
a
week
if
i
could
only
go
to
his
room
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
i
imagine
there
is
no
need
of
going
to
his
room
what
is
the
occasion
may
i
ask
of
his
note
he
was
to
have
gone
with
us
on
this
drive
to
what
is
the
place
to
cervara
you
know
it
was
arranged
yesterday
morning
in
the
evening
he
was
to
have
dined
with
us
but
he
never
came
and
this
morning
arrives
this
awful
thing
oh
dear
i
m
so
excited
would
you
mind
reading
it
rowland
took
the
note
and
glanced
at
its
lines
i
can
not
go
to
cervara
they
ran
i
have
something
else
to
do
this
will
occupy
me
perhaps
for
a
week
and
you
ll
not
see
me
don
t
miss
me
learn
not
to
miss
me
why
it
means
rowland
commented
that
he
has
taken
up
a
piece
of
work
and
that
it
is
that
s
very
good
this
explanation
was
not
sincere
but
he
had
not
the
courage
not
to
offer
it
as
a
but
he
found
he
needed
all
his
courage
to
maintain
it
for
miss
garland
had
left
her
place
and
approached
him
formidably
unsatisfied
he
does
not
work
in
the
evening
said
hudson
can
t
he
come
for
five
minutes
why
does
he
write
such
a
cruel
cold
note
to
his
poor
mother
to
poor
mary
what
have
we
done
that
he
acts
so
strangely
it
s
this
wicked
infectious
heathenish
place
and
the
poor
lady
s
suppressed
mistrust
of
the
eternal
city
broke
out
passionately
oh
dear
mallet
she
went
on
i
am
sure
he
has
the
fever
and
he
s
already
delirious
i
am
very
sure
it
s
not
that
said
miss
garland
with
a
certain
dryness
she
was
still
looking
at
rowland
his
eyes
met
hers
and
his
own
glance
fell
this
made
him
angry
and
to
carry
off
his
confusion
he
pretended
to
be
looking
at
the
floor
in
meditation
after
all
what
had
he
to
be
ashamed
of
for
a
moment
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
of
crying
out
dearest
friends
i
abdicate
i
can
t
help
you
but
he
checked
himself
he
felt
so
impatient
to
have
his
three
words
with
christina
he
grasped
his
hat
i
will
see
what
it
is
he
cried
and
then
he
was
glad
he
had
not
abdicated
for
as
he
turned
away
he
glanced
again
at
mary
and
saw
that
though
her
eyes
were
full
of
trouble
they
were
not
hard
and
accusing
but
charged
with
appealing
friendship
he
went
straight
to
roderick
s
apartment
deeming
this
at
an
early
hour
the
safest
place
to
seek
him
he
found
him
in
his
which
had
been
closely
darkened
to
keep
out
the
heat
the
carpets
and
rugs
had
been
removed
the
floor
of
speckled
concrete
was
bare
and
lightly
sprinkled
with
water
here
and
there
over
it
certain
strongly
perfumed
flowers
had
been
scattered
roderick
was
lying
on
his
divan
in
a
white
staring
up
at
the
frescoed
ceiling
the
room
was
deliciously
cool
and
filled
with
the
moist
sweet
odor
of
the
circumjacent
roses
and
violets
all
this
seemed
highly
fantastic
and
yet
rowland
hardly
felt
surprised
your
mother
was
greatly
alarmed
at
your
note
he
said
and
i
came
to
satisfy
myself
that
as
i
believed
you
are
not
roderick
lay
motionless
except
that
he
slightly
turned
his
head
toward
his
friend
he
was
smelling
a
large
white
rose
and
he
continued
to
present
it
to
his
nose
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
he
looked
exceedingly
pale
but
his
handsome
eyes
had
an
extraordinary
brilliancy
he
let
them
rest
for
some
time
on
rowland
lying
there
like
a
buddhist
in
an
intellectual
swoon
whose
perception
should
be
slowly
ebbing
back
to
temporal
matters
oh
i
m
not
ill
he
said
at
last
i
have
never
been
your
note
nevertheless
and
your
absence
rowland
said
have
very
naturally
alarmed
your
mother
i
advise
you
to
go
to
her
directly
and
reassure
go
to
her
going
to
her
would
be
worse
than
staying
away
staying
away
at
present
is
a
and
he
inhaled
deeply
his
huge
rose
looking
up
over
it
at
rowland
my
presence
in
fact
would
be
indecent
pray
why
you
see
as
regards
mary
garland
i
am
divinely
happy
does
n
t
it
strike
you
you
ought
to
agree
with
me
you
wish
me
to
spare
her
feelings
i
spare
them
by
staying
away
last
night
i
heard
something
i
heard
it
too
said
rowland
with
brevity
and
it
s
in
honor
of
this
piece
of
news
that
you
have
taken
to
your
bed
in
this
fashion
extremes
meet
i
can
t
get
up
for
may
i
inquire
how
you
heard
your
joyous
news
from
miss
light
herself
by
no
means
it
was
brought
me
by
her
maid
who
is
in
my
service
as
casamassima
s
loss
then
is
to
a
certainty
your
gain
i
don
t
talk
about
certainties
i
don
t
want
to
be
arrogant
i
don
t
want
to
offend
the
immortal
gods
i
m
keeping
very
quiet
but
i
can
t
help
being
happy
i
shall
wait
a
while
i
shall
bide
my
and
then
and
then
that
transcendent
girl
will
confess
to
me
that
when
she
threw
overboard
her
prince
she
remembered
that
i
adored
her
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
was
in
the
course
of
a
moment
rowland
s
response
to
this
speech
that
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
light
i
congratulate
you
i
envy
you
roderick
murmured
imperturbably
mrs
light
has
sent
for
me
to
remonstrate
with
her
daughter
with
whom
she
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
i
have
influence
i
don
t
know
to
what
extent
i
shall
remonstrate
but
i
give
you
notice
i
shall
not
speak
in
your
roderick
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
a
lazy
radiance
in
his
eyes
pray
don
t
he
simply
answered
you
deserve
i
should
tell
her
you
are
a
very
shabby
my
dear
rowland
the
comfort
with
you
is
that
i
can
trust
you
you
re
incapable
of
doing
anything
you
mean
to
lie
here
then
smelling
your
roses
and
nursing
your
visions
and
leaving
your
mother
and
miss
garland
to
fall
ill
with
anxiety
can
i
go
and
flaunt
my
felicity
in
their
faces
wait
till
i
get
used
to
it
a
trifle
i
have
done
them
a
palpable
wrong
but
i
can
at
least
forbear
to
add
insult
to
injury
i
may
be
an
arrant
fool
but
for
the
moment
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
to
be
prodigiously
pleased
i
should
n
t
be
able
to
conceal
it
my
pleasure
would
offend
them
so
i
lock
myself
up
as
a
dangerous
well
i
can
only
say
may
your
pleasure
never
grow
less
or
your
danger
greater
roderick
closed
his
eyes
again
and
sniffed
at
his
rose
god
s
will
be
done
on
this
rowland
left
him
and
repaired
directly
to
light
s
this
afflicted
lady
hurried
forward
to
meet
him
since
the
cavaliere
s
report
of
her
condition
she
had
somewhat
smoothed
and
trimmed
the
exuberance
of
her
distress
but
she
was
evidently
in
extreme
tribulation
and
she
clutched
rowland
by
his
two
hands
as
if
in
the
shipwreck
of
her
hopes
he
were
her
single
floating
spar
rowland
greatly
pitied
her
for
there
is
something
respectable
in
passionate
grief
even
in
a
very
bad
cause
and
as
pity
is
akin
to
love
he
endured
her
rather
better
than
he
had
done
hitherto
speak
to
her
plead
with
her
command
her
she
cried
pressing
and
shaking
his
hands
she
ll
not
heed
us
no
more
than
if
we
were
a
pair
of
clocks
perhaps
she
will
listen
to
you
she
always
liked
she
always
disliked
me
said
rowland
but
that
does
n
t
matter
now
i
have
come
here
simply
because
you
sent
for
me
not
because
i
can
help
you
i
can
not
advise
your
oh
cruel
deadly
man
you
must
advise
her
you
shan
t
leave
this
house
till
you
have
advised
her
the
poor
woman
passionately
retorted
look
at
me
in
my
misery
and
refuse
to
help
me
oh
you
need
n
t
be
afraid
i
know
i
m
a
fright
i
have
n
t
an
idea
what
i
have
on
if
this
goes
on
we
may
both
as
well
turn
scarecrows
if
ever
a
woman
was
desperate
frantic
i
am
that
woman
i
can
t
begin
to
tell
you
to
have
nourished
a
serpent
sir
all
these
years
to
have
lavished
one
s
self
upon
a
viper
that
turns
and
stings
her
own
poor
mother
to
have
toiled
and
prayed
to
have
pushed
and
struggled
to
have
eaten
the
bread
of
bitterness
and
all
the
rest
of
it
sir
and
at
the
end
of
all
things
to
find
myself
at
this
pass
it
can
t
be
it
s
too
cruel
such
things
don
t
happen
the
lord
don
t
allow
it
i
m
a
religious
woman
sir
and
the
lord
knows
all
about
me
with
his
own
hand
he
had
given
me
his
reward
i
would
have
lain
down
in
the
dust
and
let
her
walk
over
me
i
would
have
given
her
the
eyes
out
of
my
head
if
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
them
no
she
s
a
cruel
wicked
heartless
unnatural
girl
i
speak
to
you
mallet
in
my
dire
distress
as
to
my
only
friend
there
is
n
t
a
creature
here
that
i
can
look
to
not
one
of
them
all
that
i
have
faith
in
but
i
always
admired
you
i
said
to
christina
the
first
time
i
saw
you
that
there
at
last
was
a
real
gentleman
come
don
t
disappoint
me
now
i
feel
so
terribly
alone
you
see
i
feel
what
a
nasty
hard
heartless
world
it
is
that
has
come
and
devoured
my
dinners
and
danced
to
my
fiddles
and
yet
that
has
n
t
a
word
to
throw
to
me
in
my
agony
oh
the
money
alone
that
i
have
put
into
this
thing
would
melt
the
heart
of
a
turk
during
this
frenzied
outbreak
rowland
had
had
time
to
look
round
the
room
and
to
see
the
cavaliere
sitting
in
a
corner
like
a
on
the
divan
of
an
antechamber
pale
rigid
and
inscrutable
i
have
it
at
heart
to
tell
you
rowland
said
that
if
you
consider
my
friend
hudson
light
gave
a
toss
of
her
head
and
hands
oh
it
s
not
that
she
told
me
last
night
to
bother
her
no
longer
with
hudson
hudson
she
did
n
t
care
a
button
for
hudson
i
almost
wish
she
did
then
perhaps
one
might
understand
it
but
she
does
n
t
care
for
anything
in
the
wide
world
except
to
do
her
own
hard
wicked
will
and
to
crush
me
and
shame
me
with
her
ah
then
said
rowland
i
am
as
much
at
sea
as
you
and
my
presence
here
is
an
impertinence
i
should
like
to
say
three
words
to
miss
light
on
my
own
account
but
i
must
absolutely
and
inexorably
decline
to
urge
the
cause
of
prince
casamassima
this
is
simply
light
burst
into
angry
tears
because
the
poor
boy
is
a
prince
eh
because
he
s
of
a
great
family
and
has
an
income
of
millions
eh
that
s
why
you
grudge
him
and
hate
him
i
knew
there
were
vulgar
people
of
that
way
of
feeling
but
i
did
n
t
expect
it
of
you
make
an
effort
mallet
rise
to
the
occasion
forgive
the
poor
fellow
his
splendor
be
just
be
reasonable
it
s
not
his
fault
and
it
s
not
mine
he
s
the
best
the
kindest
young
man
in
the
world
and
the
most
correct
and
moral
and
virtuous
if
he
were
standing
here
in
rags
i
would
say
it
all
the
same
the
man
first
the
money
afterwards
that
was
always
my
motto
and
always
will
be
what
do
you
take
me
for
do
you
suppose
i
would
give
christina
to
a
vicious
person
do
you
suppose
i
would
sacrifice
my
precious
child
little
comfort
as
i
have
in
her
to
a
man
against
whose
character
one
word
could
be
breathed
casamassima
is
only
too
good
he
s
a
saint
of
saints
he
s
stupidly
good
there
is
n
t
such
another
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
europe
what
he
has
been
through
in
this
house
not
a
common
peasant
would
endure
christina
has
treated
him
as
you
would
n
t
treat
a
dog
he
has
been
insulted
outraged
persecuted
he
has
been
driven
hither
and
thither
till
he
did
n
t
know
where
he
was
he
has
stood
there
where
you
stand
there
with
his
name
and
his
millions
and
his
devotion
as
white
as
your
handkerchief
with
hot
tears
in
his
eyes
and
me
ready
to
go
down
on
my
knees
to
him
and
say
my
own
sweet
prince
i
could
kiss
the
ground
you
tread
on
but
it
is
n
t
decent
that
i
should
allow
you
to
enter
my
house
and
expose
yourself
to
these
horrors
and
he
would
come
back
and
he
would
come
back
and
go
through
it
all
again
and
take
all
that
was
given
him
and
only
want
the
girl
the
more
i
was
his
confidant
i
know
everything
he
used
to
beg
my
forgiveness
for
christina
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
seized
him
once
and
kissed
him
i
did
to
find
that
and
to
find
all
the
rest
with
it
and
to
believe
it
was
a
gift
straight
from
the
pitying
angels
of
heaven
and
then
to
see
it
dashed
away
before
your
eyes
and
to
stand
here
helpless
oh
it
s
a
fate
i
hope
you
may
ever
be
spared
it
would
seem
then
that
in
the
interest
of
prince
casamassima
himself
i
ought
to
refuse
to
interfere
said
rowland
light
looked
at
him
hard
slowly
drying
her
eyes
the
intensity
of
her
grief
and
anger
gave
her
a
kind
of
majesty
and
rowland
for
the
moment
felt
ashamed
of
the
ironical
ring
of
his
observation
very
good
sir
she
said
i
m
sorry
your
heart
is
not
so
tender
as
your
conscience
my
compliments
to
your
conscience
it
must
give
you
great
happiness
heaven
help
me
since
you
fail
us
we
are
indeed
driven
to
the
wall
but
i
have
fought
my
own
battles
before
and
i
have
never
lost
courage
and
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
break
down
now
cavaliere
come
here
giacosa
rose
at
her
summons
and
advanced
with
his
usual
deferential
alacrity
he
shook
hands
with
rowland
in
silence
mr
mallet
refuses
to
say
a
word
light
went
on
time
presses
every
moment
is
precious
heaven
knows
what
that
poor
boy
may
be
doing
if
at
this
moment
a
clever
woman
should
get
hold
of
him
she
might
be
as
ugly
as
she
pleased
it
s
horrible
to
think
of
the
cavaliere
fixed
his
eyes
on
rowland
and
his
look
which
the
night
before
had
been
singular
was
now
most
extraordinary
there
was
a
nameless
force
of
anguish
in
it
which
seemed
to
grapple
with
the
young
man
s
reluctance
to
plead
to
entreat
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
glazed
over
with
a
reflection
of
strange
things
suddenly
though
most
vaguely
rowland
felt
the
presence
of
a
new
element
in
the
drama
that
was
going
on
before
him
he
looked
from
the
cavaliere
to
light
whose
eyes
were
now
quite
dry
and
were
fixed
in
stony
hardness
on
the
floor
if
you
could
bring
yourself
the
cavaliere
said
in
a
low
soft
caressing
voice
to
address
a
few
words
of
solemn
remonstrance
to
miss
light
you
would
perhaps
do
more
for
us
than
you
know
you
would
save
several
persons
a
great
pain
the
dear
signora
first
and
then
christina
herself
christina
in
particular
me
too
i
might
take
the
liberty
to
add
there
was
to
rowland
something
acutely
touching
in
this
humble
petition
he
had
always
felt
a
sort
of
imaginative
tenderness
for
poor
little
unexplained
giacosa
and
these
words
seemed
a
supreme
contortion
of
the
mysterious
obliquity
of
his
life
all
of
a
sudden
as
he
watched
the
cavaliere
something
occurred
to
him
it
was
something
very
odd
and
it
stayed
his
glance
suddenly
from
again
turning
to
light
his
idea
embarrassed
him
and
to
carry
off
his
embarrassment
he
repeated
that
it
was
folly
to
suppose
that
his
words
would
have
any
weight
with
christina
the
cavaliere
stepped
forward
and
laid
two
fingers
on
rowland
s
breast
do
you
wish
to
know
the
truth
you
are
the
only
man
whose
words
she
rowland
was
going
from
surprise
to
surprise
i
will
say
what
i
can
he
said
by
this
time
he
had
ventured
to
glance
at
light
she
was
looking
at
him
askance
as
if
upon
this
she
was
suddenly
mistrusting
his
motives
if
you
fail
she
said
sharply
we
have
something
else
but
please
to
lose
no
she
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
sound
of
a
short
sharp
growl
caused
the
company
to
turn
christina
s
fleecy
poodle
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
vast
saloon
with
his
muzzle
lowered
in
pompous
defiance
of
the
three
conspirators
against
the
comfort
of
his
mistress
this
young
lady
s
claims
for
him
seemed
justified
he
was
an
animal
of
amazingly
delicate
instincts
he
had
preceded
christina
as
a
sort
of
of
defense
and
she
now
slowly
advanced
from
a
neighboring
room
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
listen
to
mallet
her
mother
said
in
a
terrible
voice
and
to
reflect
carefully
upon
what
he
says
i
suppose
you
will
admit
that
he
is
disinterested
in
half
an
hour
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
and
passing
her
hand
through
the
cavaliere
s
arm
she
swept
rapidly
out
of
the
room
christina
looked
hard
at
rowland
but
offered
him
no
greeting
she
was
very
pale
and
strangely
enough
it
at
first
seemed
to
rowland
that
her
beauty
was
in
eclipse
but
he
very
soon
perceived
that
it
had
only
changed
its
character
and
that
if
it
was
a
trifle
less
brilliant
than
usual
it
was
admirably
touching
and
noble
the
clouded
light
of
her
eyes
the
magnificent
gravity
of
her
features
the
conscious
erectness
of
her
head
might
have
belonged
to
a
deposed
sovereign
or
a
condemned
martyr
why
have
you
come
here
at
this
time
she
asked
your
mother
sent
for
me
in
pressing
terms
and
i
was
very
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
have
you
come
to
help
me
or
to
persecute
me
i
have
as
little
power
to
do
one
as
i
have
desire
to
do
the
other
i
came
in
great
part
to
ask
you
a
question
first
your
decision
is
irrevocable
christina
s
two
hands
had
been
hanging
clasped
in
front
of
her
she
separated
them
and
flung
them
apart
by
an
admirable
gesture
would
you
have
done
this
if
you
had
not
seen
miss
garland
she
looked
at
him
with
quickened
attention
then
suddenly
this
is
interesting
she
cried
let
us
have
it
and
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
and
pointed
to
another
you
don
t
answer
my
question
rowland
said
you
have
no
right
that
i
know
of
to
ask
it
but
it
s
a
very
clever
one
so
clever
that
it
deserves
an
answer
very
likely
i
would
last
night
when
i
said
that
to
myself
i
was
extremely
angry
rowland
rejoined
oh
dear
and
you
are
not
angry
now
i
am
less
how
very
stupid
but
you
can
say
something
at
if
i
were
to
say
what
is
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
would
say
that
face
to
face
with
you
it
is
never
possible
to
condemn
perche
you
know
yourself
but
i
can
at
least
say
now
what
i
felt
last
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
had
consciously
cruelly
dealt
a
blow
at
that
poor
girl
do
you
understand
wait
a
moment
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
she
inclined
her
head
on
one
side
meditatively
then
a
cold
brilliant
smile
covered
her
face
and
she
made
a
gesture
of
negation
i
see
your
train
of
reasoning
but
it
s
quite
wrong
i
meant
no
harm
to
miss
garland
i
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
make
her
suffer
tell
me
you
believe
this
was
said
with
ineffable
candor
rowland
heard
himself
answering
i
believe
it
and
yet
in
a
sense
your
supposition
was
true
christina
continued
i
conceived
as
i
told
you
a
great
admiration
for
miss
garland
and
i
frankly
confess
i
was
jealous
of
her
what
i
envied
her
was
simply
her
character
i
said
to
myself
she
in
my
place
would
n
t
marry
i
could
not
help
saying
it
and
i
said
it
so
often
that
i
found
a
kind
of
inspiration
in
it
i
hated
the
idea
of
being
worse
than
she
of
doing
something
that
she
would
n
t
do
i
might
be
bad
by
nature
but
i
need
n
t
be
by
volition
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
i
found
it
impossible
not
to
tell
the
prince
that
i
was
his
very
humble
servant
but
that
i
could
not
marry
are
you
sure
it
was
only
of
miss
garland
s
character
that
you
were
jealous
not
of
not
of
speak
out
i
beg
you
we
are
talking
philosophy
not
of
her
affection
for
her
cousin
sure
is
a
good
deal
to
ask
still
i
think
i
may
say
it
there
are
two
reasons
one
at
least
i
can
tell
you
her
affection
has
not
a
shadow
s
weight
with
hudson
why
then
should
one
fear
it
and
what
is
the
other
reason
excuse
me
that
is
my
own
rowland
was
puzzled
baffled
charmed
inspired
almost
all
at
once
i
have
promised
your
mother
he
presently
resumed
to
say
something
in
favor
of
prince
she
shook
her
head
sadly
prince
casamassima
needs
nothing
that
you
can
say
for
him
he
is
a
magnificent
parti
i
know
it
you
know
also
of
the
extreme
affliction
of
your
mother
her
affliction
is
demonstrative
she
has
been
abusing
me
for
the
last
hours
as
if
i
were
the
vilest
of
the
to
see
christina
sit
there
in
the
purity
of
her
beauty
and
say
this
might
have
made
one
bow
one
s
head
with
a
kind
of
awe
i
have
failed
of
respect
to
her
at
other
times
but
i
have
not
done
so
now
since
we
are
talking
philosophy
she
pursued
with
a
gentle
smile
i
may
say
it
s
a
simple
matter
i
don
t
love
him
or
rather
perhaps
since
we
are
talking
philosophy
i
may
say
it
s
not
a
simple
matter
i
spoke
just
now
of
inspiration
the
inspiration
has
been
great
but
i
frankly
confess
it
the
choice
has
been
hard
shall
i
tell
you
she
demanded
with
sudden
ardor
will
you
understand
me
it
was
on
the
one
side
the
world
the
splendid
beautiful
powerful
interesting
world
i
know
what
that
is
i
have
tasted
of
the
cup
i
know
its
sweetness
ah
if
i
chose
if
i
let
myself
go
if
i
flung
everything
to
the
winds
the
world
and
i
would
be
famous
friends
i
know
its
merits
and
i
think
without
vanity
it
would
see
mine
you
would
see
some
fine
things
i
should
like
to
be
a
princess
and
i
think
i
should
be
a
very
good
one
i
would
play
my
part
well
i
am
fond
of
luxury
i
am
fond
of
a
great
society
i
am
fond
of
being
looked
at
i
am
corrupt
corruptible
corruption
ah
what
a
pity
that
could
n
t
be
too
mercy
of
heaven
there
was
a
passionate
tremor
in
her
voice
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
sat
motionless
rowland
saw
that
an
intense
agitation
hitherto
successfully
repressed
underlay
her
calmness
and
he
could
easily
believe
that
her
battle
had
been
fierce
she
rose
quickly
and
turned
away
walked
a
few
paces
and
stopped
in
a
moment
she
was
facing
him
again
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
flush
in
her
cheeks
but
you
need
n
t
think
i
m
afraid
she
said
i
have
chosen
and
i
shall
hold
to
it
i
have
something
here
here
here
and
she
patted
her
heart
it
s
my
own
i
shan
t
part
with
it
is
it
what
you
call
an
ideal
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
care
it
is
brighter
than
the
casamassima
diamonds
you
say
that
certain
things
are
your
own
affair
rowland
presently
rejoined
but
i
must
nevertheless
make
an
attempt
to
learn
what
all
this
means
what
it
promises
for
my
friend
hudson
is
there
any
hope
for
him
this
is
a
point
i
can
t
discuss
with
you
minutely
i
like
him
very
would
you
marry
him
if
he
were
to
ask
you
he
has
asked
and
if
he
asks
again
i
shall
marry
no
one
just
roderick
said
rowland
has
great
does
he
know
of
my
rupture
with
the
prince
he
is
making
a
great
holiday
of
christina
pulled
her
poodle
towards
her
and
began
to
smooth
his
silky
fleece
i
like
him
very
much
she
repeated
much
more
than
i
used
to
since
you
told
me
all
that
about
him
at
saint
cecilia
s
i
have
felt
a
great
friendship
for
him
there
s
something
very
fine
about
him
he
s
not
afraid
of
anything
he
is
not
afraid
of
failure
he
is
not
afraid
of
ruin
or
poor
fellow
said
rowland
bitterly
he
is
fatally
picturesque
yes
that
s
what
he
is
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
mother
told
me
just
now
that
you
had
said
that
you
did
n
t
care
a
straw
for
very
likely
i
meant
as
a
lover
one
does
n
t
want
a
lover
one
pities
and
one
does
n
t
want
of
all
things
in
the
world
a
picturesque
husband
i
should
like
hudson
as
something
else
i
wish
he
were
my
brother
so
that
he
could
never
talk
to
me
of
marriage
then
i
could
adore
him
i
would
nurse
him
i
would
wait
on
him
and
save
him
all
disagreeable
rubs
and
shocks
i
am
much
stronger
than
he
and
i
would
stand
between
him
and
the
world
indeed
with
hudson
for
my
brother
i
should
be
willing
to
live
and
die
an
old
maid
have
you
ever
told
him
all
this
i
suppose
so
i
ve
told
him
five
hundred
things
if
it
would
please
you
i
will
tell
him
oh
heaven
forbid
cried
poor
rowland
with
a
groan
he
was
lingering
there
weighing
his
sympathy
against
his
irritation
and
feeling
it
sink
in
the
scale
when
the
curtain
of
a
distant
doorway
was
lifted
and
light
passed
across
the
room
she
stopped
and
gave
the
young
persons
a
flushed
and
menacing
look
it
found
apparently
little
to
reassure
her
and
she
moved
away
with
a
passionate
toss
of
her
drapery
rowland
thought
with
horror
of
the
sinister
compulsion
to
which
the
young
girl
was
to
be
subjected
in
this
ethereal
flight
of
hers
there
was
a
certain
painful
effort
and
tension
of
wing
but
it
was
none
the
less
piteous
to
imagine
her
being
rudely
jerked
down
to
the
base
earth
she
was
doing
her
adventurous
utmost
to
spurn
she
would
need
all
her
magnanimity
for
her
own
trial
and
it
seemed
gross
to
make
further
demands
upon
it
on
roderick
s
behalf
rowland
took
up
his
hat
you
asked
a
while
ago
if
i
had
come
to
help
you
he
said
if
i
knew
how
i
might
help
you
i
should
be
particularly
she
stood
silent
a
moment
reflecting
then
at
last
looking
up
you
remember
she
said
your
promising
me
six
months
ago
to
tell
me
what
you
finally
thought
of
me
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
he
could
hardly
help
smiling
madame
grandoni
had
insisted
on
the
fact
that
christina
was
an
actress
though
a
sincere
one
and
this
little
speech
seemed
a
glimpse
of
the
cloven
foot
she
had
played
her
great
scene
she
had
made
her
point
and
now
she
had
her
eye
at
the
hole
in
the
curtain
and
she
was
watching
the
house
but
she
blushed
as
she
perceived
his
smile
and
her
blush
which
was
beautiful
made
her
fault
venial
you
are
an
excellent
girl
he
said
in
a
particular
tone
and
gave
her
his
hand
in
farewell
there
was
a
great
chain
of
rooms
in
light
s
apartment
the
pride
and
joy
of
the
hostess
on
festal
evenings
through
which
the
departing
visitor
passed
before
reaching
the
door
in
one
of
the
first
of
these
rowland
found
himself
waylaid
and
arrested
by
the
distracted
lady
herself
well
well
she
cried
seizing
his
arm
has
she
listened
to
you
have
you
moved
her
in
heaven
s
name
dear
madame
rowland
begged
leave
the
poor
girl
alone
she
is
behaving
very
well
behaving
very
well
is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
me
i
don
t
believe
you
said
a
proper
word
to
her
you
are
conspiring
together
to
kill
me
rowland
tried
to
soothe
her
to
remonstrate
to
persuade
her
that
it
was
equally
cruel
and
unwise
to
try
to
force
matters
but
she
answered
him
only
with
harsh
lamentations
and
imprecations
and
ended
by
telling
him
that
her
daughter
was
her
property
not
his
and
that
his
interference
was
most
insolent
and
most
scandalous
her
disappointment
seemed
really
to
have
crazed
her
and
his
only
possible
rejoinder
was
to
take
a
summary
departure
a
moment
later
he
came
upon
the
cavaliere
who
was
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
in
his
hands
so
buried
in
thought
that
rowland
had
to
call
him
before
he
roused
himself
giacosa
looked
at
him
a
moment
keenly
and
then
gave
a
shake
of
the
head
interrogatively
rowland
gave
a
shake
negative
to
which
the
cavaliere
responded
by
a
long
melancholy
sigh
but
her
mother
is
determined
to
force
matters
said
rowland
it
seems
that
it
must
be
do
you
consider
that
it
must
be
i
don
t
differ
with
light
it
will
be
a
great
cruelty
the
cavaliere
gave
a
tragic
shrug
eh
it
is
n
t
an
easy
you
should
do
nothing
to
make
it
harder
what
will
you
have
it
s
a
magnificent
you
disappoint
me
cavaliere
said
rowland
solemnly
i
imagined
you
appreciated
the
great
elevation
of
miss
light
s
attitude
she
does
n
t
love
the
prince
she
has
let
the
matter
stand
or
fall
by
the
old
man
grasped
him
by
the
hand
and
stood
a
moment
with
averted
eyes
at
last
looking
at
him
he
held
up
two
fingers
i
have
two
hearts
he
said
one
for
myself
one
for
the
world
this
one
opposes
miss
light
the
other
adores
her
one
suffers
horribly
at
what
the
other
i
don
t
understand
double
people
cavaliere
rowland
said
and
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
you
but
i
have
guessed
that
you
are
going
to
play
some
secret
the
card
is
light
s
not
mine
said
the
cavaliere
it
s
a
menace
at
any
rate
the
sword
of
damocles
it
hangs
by
a
hair
christina
is
to
be
given
ten
minutes
to
recant
under
penalty
of
having
it
fall
on
the
blade
there
is
something
written
in
strange
characters
don
t
scratch
your
head
you
will
not
make
it
i
think
i
have
guessed
it
rowland
said
after
a
pregnant
silence
the
cavaliere
looked
at
him
blankly
but
intently
and
rowland
added
though
there
are
some
signs
indeed
i
don
t
puzzle
them
out
at
your
leisure
said
the
cavaliere
shaking
his
hand
i
hear
light
i
must
go
to
my
post
i
wish
you
were
a
catholic
i
would
beg
you
to
step
into
the
first
church
you
come
to
and
pray
for
us
the
next
for
us
for
whom
for
all
of
us
at
any
rate
remember
this
i
worship
the
christina
rowland
heard
the
rustle
of
light
s
dress
he
turned
away
and
the
cavaliere
went
as
he
said
to
his
post
rowland
for
the
next
couple
of
days
pondered
his
riddle
chapter
xi
hudson
of
roderick
meanwhile
rowland
saw
nothing
but
he
immediately
went
to
hudson
and
assured
her
that
her
son
was
in
even
exceptionally
good
health
and
spirits
after
this
he
called
again
on
the
two
ladies
from
northampton
but
as
roderick
s
absence
continued
he
was
able
neither
to
furnish
nor
to
obtain
much
comfort
miss
garland
s
apprehensive
face
seemed
to
him
an
image
of
his
own
state
of
mind
he
was
profoundly
depressed
he
felt
that
there
was
a
storm
in
the
air
and
he
wished
it
would
come
without
more
delay
and
perform
its
ravages
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
he
went
into
saint
peter
s
his
frequent
resort
whenever
the
outer
world
was
disagreeable
from
a
to
a
roman
rain
there
were
few
importunate
pains
the
great
church
did
not
help
him
to
forget
he
had
wandered
there
for
half
an
hour
when
he
came
upon
a
short
figure
lurking
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
great
piers
he
saw
it
was
that
of
an
artist
hastily
transferring
to
his
a
memento
of
some
fleeting
variation
in
the
scenery
of
the
basilica
and
in
a
moment
he
perceived
that
the
artist
was
little
sam
singleton
singleton
pocketed
his
with
a
guilty
air
as
if
it
cost
his
modesty
a
pang
to
be
detected
in
this
greedy
culture
of
opportunity
rowland
always
enjoyed
meeting
him
talking
with
him
in
these
days
was
as
good
as
a
wayside
gush
of
clear
cold
water
on
a
long
hot
walk
there
was
perhaps
no
and
you
had
to
apply
your
lips
to
some
simple
natural
conduit
but
the
result
was
always
a
sense
of
extreme
moral
refreshment
on
this
occasion
he
mentally
blessed
the
ingenuous
little
artist
and
heard
presently
with
keen
regret
that
he
was
to
leave
rome
on
the
morrow
singleton
had
come
to
bid
farewell
to
saint
peter
s
and
he
was
gathering
a
few
supreme
memories
he
had
earned
a
of
money
and
he
was
meaning
to
take
a
summer
s
holiday
going
to
switzerland
to
germany
to
paris
in
the
autumn
he
was
to
return
home
his
family
composed
as
rowland
knew
of
a
father
who
was
cashier
in
a
bank
and
five
unmarried
sisters
one
of
whom
gave
on
woman
s
rights
the
whole
resident
at
buffalo
new
york
had
been
writing
him
peremptory
letters
and
appealing
to
him
as
a
son
brother
and
he
would
have
been
grateful
for
another
year
in
rome
but
what
must
be
must
be
and
he
had
laid
up
treasure
which
in
buffalo
would
seem
infinite
they
talked
some
time
rowland
hoped
they
might
meet
in
switzerland
and
take
a
walk
or
two
together
singleton
seemed
to
feel
that
buffalo
had
marked
him
for
her
own
he
was
afraid
he
should
not
see
rome
again
for
many
a
year
so
you
expect
to
live
at
buffalo
rowland
asked
sympathetically
well
it
will
depend
upon
the
views
upon
the
attitude
of
my
family
singleton
replied
oh
i
think
i
shall
get
on
i
think
it
can
be
done
if
i
find
it
can
be
done
i
shall
really
be
quite
proud
of
it
as
an
artist
of
course
i
mean
you
know
do
you
know
i
have
some
nine
hundred
sketches
i
shall
live
in
my
portfolio
and
so
long
as
one
is
not
in
rome
pray
what
does
it
matter
where
one
is
but
how
i
shall
envy
all
you
romans
you
and
gloriani
and
hudson
especially
don
t
envy
hudson
he
has
nothing
to
singleton
grinned
at
what
he
considered
a
harmless
jest
yes
he
s
going
to
be
the
great
man
of
our
time
and
i
say
mallet
is
n
t
it
a
mighty
comfort
that
it
s
we
who
have
turned
him
out
between
ourselves
said
rowland
he
has
disappointed
singleton
stared
dear
me
what
did
you
expect
truly
said
rowland
to
himself
what
did
i
expect
i
confess
cried
singleton
i
can
t
judge
him
rationally
he
fascinates
me
he
s
the
sort
of
man
one
makes
one
s
hero
strictly
speaking
he
is
not
a
hero
said
rowland
singleton
looked
intensely
grave
and
with
almost
tearful
eyes
is
there
anything
amiss
anything
out
of
the
way
about
him
he
timidly
asked
then
as
rowland
hesitated
to
reply
he
quickly
added
please
if
there
is
don
t
tell
me
i
want
to
know
no
evil
of
him
and
i
think
i
should
hardly
believe
it
in
my
memories
of
this
roman
he
will
be
the
central
figure
he
will
stand
there
in
radiant
relief
as
beautiful
and
unspotted
as
one
of
his
own
statues
amen
said
rowland
gravely
he
remembered
afresh
that
the
sea
is
inhabited
by
big
fishes
and
little
and
that
the
latter
often
find
their
way
down
the
throats
of
the
former
singleton
was
going
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
taking
last
looks
at
certain
other
places
and
rowland
offered
to
join
him
on
his
sentimental
circuit
but
as
they
were
preparing
to
leave
the
church
he
heard
himself
suddenly
addressed
from
behind
turning
he
beheld
a
young
woman
whom
he
immediately
recognized
as
madame
grandoni
s
maid
her
mistress
was
present
she
said
and
begged
to
confer
with
him
before
he
departed
this
summons
obliged
rowland
to
separate
from
singleton
to
whom
he
bade
farewell
he
followed
the
messenger
and
presently
found
madame
grandoni
occupying
a
liberal
area
on
the
steps
of
the
tribune
behind
the
great
altar
where
spreading
a
shawl
on
the
polished
red
marble
she
had
comfortably
seated
herself
he
expected
that
she
had
something
especial
to
impart
and
she
lost
no
time
in
bringing
forth
her
treasure
don
t
shout
very
loud
she
said
remember
that
we
are
in
church
there
s
a
limit
to
the
noise
one
may
make
even
in
saint
peter
s
christina
light
was
married
this
morning
to
prince
rowland
did
not
shout
at
all
he
gave
a
deep
short
murmur
married
this
morning
married
this
morning
at
seven
o
clock
le
plus
tranquillement
du
monde
before
three
or
four
persons
the
young
couple
left
rome
an
hour
for
some
moments
this
seemed
to
him
really
terrible
the
dark
little
drama
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
had
played
itself
out
he
had
believed
that
christina
would
resist
that
she
had
succumbed
was
a
proof
that
the
pressure
had
been
cruel
rowland
s
imagination
followed
her
forth
with
an
irresistible
tremor
into
the
world
toward
which
she
was
rolling
away
with
her
detested
husband
and
her
stifled
ideal
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
if
the
first
impulse
of
his
compassion
was
for
christina
the
second
was
for
prince
casamassima
madame
grandoni
acknowledged
an
extreme
curiosity
as
to
the
secret
springs
of
these
strange
doings
casamassima
s
sudden
dismissal
his
still
more
sudden
recall
the
hurried
private
marriage
listen
said
rowland
hereupon
and
i
will
tell
you
and
he
related
in
detail
his
last
visit
to
light
and
his
talk
with
this
lady
with
christina
and
with
the
cavaliere
good
she
said
it
s
all
very
curious
but
it
s
a
riddle
and
i
only
half
guess
well
said
rowland
i
desire
to
harm
no
one
but
certain
suppositions
have
taken
shape
in
my
mind
which
serve
as
a
solvent
to
several
it
is
very
true
madame
grandoni
answered
that
the
cavaliere
as
he
stands
has
always
needed
to
be
he
is
explained
by
the
hypothesis
that
years
ago
at
ancona
light
had
a
i
see
ancona
was
dull
light
was
lively
and
years
ago
perhaps
the
cavaliere
was
fascinating
doubtless
it
would
be
fairer
to
say
that
he
was
fascinated
poor
giacosa
he
has
had
his
compensation
rowland
said
he
has
been
passionately
fond
of
naturally
but
has
christina
never
wondered
why
if
she
had
been
near
guessing
her
mother
s
shabby
treatment
of
him
would
have
put
her
off
the
scent
light
s
conscience
has
apparently
told
her
that
she
could
expiate
an
hour
s
too
great
kindness
by
twenty
years
contempt
so
she
kept
her
secret
but
what
is
the
profit
of
having
a
secret
unless
you
can
make
some
use
of
it
the
day
at
last
came
when
she
could
turn
hers
to
account
she
could
let
the
skeleton
out
of
the
closet
and
create
a
i
don
t
neither
do
i
morally
said
rowland
i
only
conceive
that
there
was
a
horrible
fabulous
scene
the
poor
cavaliere
stood
outside
at
the
door
white
as
a
corpse
and
as
dumb
the
mother
and
daughter
had
it
out
together
light
burnt
her
ships
when
she
came
out
she
had
three
lines
of
writing
in
her
daughter
s
hand
which
the
cavaliere
was
dispatched
with
to
the
prince
they
overtook
the
young
man
in
time
and
when
he
reappeared
he
was
delighted
to
dispense
with
further
waiting
i
don
t
know
what
he
thought
of
the
look
in
his
bride
s
face
but
that
is
how
i
roughly
reconstruct
christina
was
forced
to
decide
then
that
she
could
not
afford
not
to
be
a
princess
she
was
reduced
by
humiliation
she
was
assured
that
it
was
not
for
her
to
make
conditions
but
to
thank
her
stars
that
there
were
none
made
for
her
if
she
persisted
she
might
find
it
coming
to
pass
that
there
would
be
conditions
and
the
formal
rupture
the
rupture
that
the
world
would
hear
of
and
pry
into
would
then
proceed
from
the
prince
and
not
from
that
s
all
nonsense
said
madame
grandoni
energetically
to
us
yes
but
not
to
the
proudest
girl
in
the
world
deeply
wounded
in
her
pride
and
not
stopping
to
calculate
probabilities
but
muffling
her
shame
with
an
almost
sensuous
relief
in
a
splendor
that
stood
within
her
grasp
and
asked
no
questions
is
it
not
possible
that
the
late
light
had
made
an
outbreak
before
witnesses
who
are
still
living
certainly
her
marriage
now
said
madame
grandoni
less
analytically
has
the
advantage
that
it
takes
her
away
from
her
parents
this
lady
s
farther
comments
upon
the
event
are
not
immediately
pertinent
to
our
history
there
were
some
other
comments
of
which
rowland
had
a
deeply
oppressive
foreboding
he
called
on
the
evening
of
the
morrow
upon
hudson
and
found
roderick
with
the
two
ladies
their
companion
had
apparently
but
lately
entered
and
rowland
afterwards
learned
that
it
was
his
first
appearance
since
the
writing
of
the
note
which
had
so
distressed
his
mother
he
had
flung
himself
upon
a
sofa
where
he
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
staring
before
him
with
a
sinister
spark
in
his
eye
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
rowland
but
gave
him
no
greeting
he
had
evidently
been
saying
something
to
startle
the
women
hudson
had
gone
and
seated
herself
timidly
and
imploringly
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
trying
to
take
his
hand
miss
garland
was
applying
herself
to
some
needlework
with
conscious
intentness
hudson
gave
rowland
on
his
entrance
a
touching
look
of
gratitude
oh
we
have
such
blessed
news
she
said
roderick
is
ready
to
leave
it
s
not
blessed
news
it
s
most
damnable
news
cried
roderick
oh
but
we
are
very
glad
my
son
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
when
you
get
away
you
re
looking
most
dreadfully
thin
is
n
t
he
mallet
it
s
plain
enough
you
need
a
change
i
m
sure
we
will
go
wherever
you
like
where
would
you
like
to
go
roderick
turned
his
head
slowly
and
looked
at
her
he
had
let
her
take
his
hand
which
she
pressed
tenderly
between
her
own
he
gazed
at
her
for
some
time
in
silence
poor
mother
he
said
at
last
in
a
portentous
tone
my
own
dear
son
murmured
hudson
in
all
the
innocence
of
her
trust
i
don
t
care
a
straw
where
you
go
i
don
t
care
a
straw
for
anything
oh
my
dear
boy
you
must
not
say
that
before
all
of
us
here
before
mary
before
mallet
mary
mallet
roderick
repeated
almost
savagely
he
released
himself
from
the
clasp
of
his
mother
s
hand
and
turned
away
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
holding
his
head
in
his
hands
there
was
a
silence
rowland
said
nothing
because
he
was
watching
miss
garland
why
should
i
stand
on
ceremony
with
mary
and
mallet
roderick
presently
added
mary
pretends
to
believe
i
m
a
fine
fellow
and
if
she
believes
it
as
she
ought
to
nothing
i
can
say
will
alter
her
opinion
mallet
knows
i
m
a
hopeless
humbug
so
i
need
n
t
mince
my
words
with
ah
my
dear
don
t
use
such
dreadful
language
said
hudson
are
n
t
we
all
devoted
to
you
and
proud
of
you
and
waiting
only
to
hear
what
you
want
so
that
we
may
do
it
roderick
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
he
was
evidently
in
a
restless
reckless
profoundly
demoralized
condition
rowland
felt
that
it
was
literally
true
that
he
did
not
care
a
straw
for
anything
but
he
observed
with
anxiety
that
hudson
who
did
not
know
on
what
delicate
ground
she
was
treading
was
disposed
to
chide
him
caressingly
as
a
mere
expression
of
tenderness
he
foresaw
that
she
would
bring
down
the
hovering
thunderbolt
on
her
head
in
god
s
name
roderick
cried
don
t
remind
me
of
my
obligations
it
s
intolerable
to
me
and
i
don
t
believe
it
s
pleasant
to
mallet
i
know
they
re
tremendous
i
know
i
shall
never
repay
them
i
m
bankrupt
do
you
know
what
that
means
the
poor
lady
sat
staring
dismayed
and
rowland
angrily
interfered
don
t
talk
such
stuff
to
your
mother
he
cried
don
t
you
see
you
re
frightening
her
frightening
her
she
may
as
well
be
frightened
first
as
last
do
i
frighten
you
mother
roderick
demanded
oh
roderick
what
do
you
mean
whimpered
the
poor
lady
mr
mallet
what
does
he
mean
i
mean
that
i
m
an
angry
savage
disappointed
miserable
man
roderick
went
on
i
mean
that
i
can
t
do
a
stroke
of
work
nor
think
a
profitable
thought
i
mean
that
i
m
in
a
state
of
helpless
rage
and
grief
and
shame
helpless
helpless
that
s
what
it
is
you
can
t
help
me
poor
mother
not
with
kisses
nor
tears
nor
prayers
mary
can
t
help
me
not
for
all
the
honor
she
does
me
nor
all
the
big
books
on
art
that
she
pores
over
mallet
can
t
help
me
not
with
all
his
money
nor
all
his
good
example
nor
all
his
friendship
which
i
m
so
profoundly
well
aware
of
not
with
it
all
multiplied
a
thousand
times
and
repeated
to
all
eternity
i
thought
you
would
help
me
you
and
mary
that
s
why
i
sent
for
you
but
you
can
t
don
t
think
it
the
sooner
you
give
up
the
idea
the
better
for
you
give
up
being
proud
of
me
too
there
s
nothing
left
of
me
to
be
proud
of
a
year
ago
i
was
a
mighty
fine
fellow
but
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
me
now
i
have
gone
to
the
devil
there
was
something
in
the
ring
of
roderick
s
voice
as
he
uttered
these
words
which
sent
them
home
with
convincing
force
he
was
not
talking
for
effect
or
the
mere
sensuous
pleasure
of
extravagant
and
paradoxical
utterance
as
had
often
enough
been
the
case
ere
this
he
was
not
even
talking
viciously
or
he
was
talking
passionately
desperately
and
from
an
irresistible
need
to
throw
off
the
oppressive
burden
of
his
mother
s
confidence
his
cruel
eloquence
brought
the
poor
lady
to
her
feet
and
she
stood
there
with
clasped
hands
petrified
and
voiceless
mary
garland
quickly
left
her
place
came
straight
to
roderick
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
looking
at
him
with
all
her
tormented
heart
in
her
eyes
he
made
no
movement
to
disengage
himself
he
simply
shook
his
head
several
times
in
dogged
negation
of
her
healing
powers
rowland
had
been
living
for
the
past
month
in
such
intolerable
expectancy
of
disaster
that
now
that
the
ice
was
broken
and
the
fatal
plunge
taken
his
foremost
feeling
was
almost
elation
but
in
a
moment
his
orderly
instincts
and
his
natural
love
of
superficial
smoothness
overtook
it
i
really
don
t
see
roderick
he
said
the
profit
of
your
talking
in
just
this
way
at
just
this
time
don
t
you
see
how
you
are
making
your
mother
suffer
do
i
enjoy
it
myself
cried
roderick
is
the
suffering
all
on
your
side
and
theirs
do
i
look
as
if
i
were
happy
and
were
stirring
you
up
with
a
stick
for
my
amusement
here
we
all
are
in
the
same
boat
we
might
as
well
understand
each
other
these
women
must
know
that
i
m
not
to
be
counted
on
that
sounds
remarkably
cool
no
doubt
and
i
certainly
don
t
deny
your
right
to
be
utterly
disgusted
with
will
you
keep
what
you
have
got
to
say
till
another
time
said
mary
and
let
me
hear
it
alone
oh
i
ll
let
you
hear
it
as
often
as
you
please
but
what
s
the
use
of
keeping
it
i
m
in
the
humor
it
won
t
keep
it
s
a
very
simple
matter
i
m
a
failure
that
s
all
i
m
not
a
man
i
m
anything
you
please
after
that
it
s
all
one
mary
garland
turned
away
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
but
roderick
struck
apparently
in
some
unwonted
fashion
with
her
gesture
drew
her
towards
him
again
and
went
on
in
a
somewhat
different
tone
it
s
hardly
worth
while
we
should
have
any
private
talk
about
this
mary
he
said
the
thing
would
be
comfortable
for
neither
of
us
it
s
better
after
all
that
it
be
said
once
for
all
and
dismissed
there
are
things
i
can
t
talk
to
you
about
can
i
at
least
you
are
such
a
queer
creature
i
can
imagine
nothing
you
should
n
t
talk
to
me
about
said
mary
you
are
not
afraid
he
demanded
sharply
looking
at
her
she
turned
away
abruptly
with
lowered
eyes
hesitating
a
moment
anything
you
think
i
should
hear
i
will
hear
she
said
and
then
she
returned
to
her
place
at
the
window
and
took
up
her
work
i
have
had
a
great
blow
said
roderick
i
was
a
great
ass
but
it
does
n
t
make
the
blow
any
easier
to
mr
mallet
tell
me
what
roderick
means
said
hudson
who
had
found
her
voice
in
a
tone
more
peremptory
than
rowland
had
ever
heard
her
use
he
ought
to
have
told
you
before
said
roderick
really
rowland
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
you
ought
you
could
have
given
a
much
better
account
of
all
this
than
i
myself
better
especially
in
that
it
would
have
been
more
lenient
to
me
you
ought
to
have
let
them
down
gently
it
would
have
saved
them
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
you
always
want
to
keep
things
so
smooth
allow
me
to
say
that
it
s
very
weak
of
i
hereby
renounce
such
weakness
said
rowland
oh
what
is
it
sir
what
is
it
groaned
hudson
insistently
it
s
what
roderick
says
he
s
a
failure
mary
garland
on
hearing
this
declaration
gave
rowland
a
single
glance
and
then
rose
laid
down
her
work
and
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
room
hudson
tossed
her
head
and
timidly
bristled
this
from
you
mallet
she
said
with
an
injured
air
which
rowland
found
harrowing
but
roderick
most
characteristically
did
not
in
the
least
resent
his
friend
s
assertion
he
sent
him
on
the
contrary
one
of
those
large
clear
looks
of
his
which
seemed
to
express
a
stoical
pleasure
in
rowland
s
frankness
and
which
set
his
companion
then
and
there
wondering
again
as
he
had
so
often
done
before
at
the
extraordinary
contradictions
of
his
temperament
my
dear
mother
roderick
said
if
you
had
had
eyes
that
were
not
blinded
by
this
sad
maternal
vanity
you
would
have
seen
all
this
for
yourself
you
would
have
seen
that
i
m
anything
but
is
it
anything
about
money
cried
hudson
oh
do
write
to
striker
money
said
roderick
i
have
n
t
a
cent
of
money
i
m
bankrupt
oh
mallet
how
could
you
let
him
asked
hudson
terribly
everything
i
have
is
at
his
service
said
rowland
feeling
of
course
mallet
will
help
you
my
son
cried
the
poor
lady
eagerly
oh
leave
mallet
alone
said
roderick
i
have
squeezed
him
dry
it
s
not
my
fault
at
least
if
i
have
n
t
roderick
what
have
you
done
with
all
your
money
his
mother
demanded
thrown
it
away
it
was
no
such
great
amount
i
have
done
nothing
this
you
have
done
nothing
i
have
done
no
work
why
in
the
world
did
n
t
you
guess
it
and
spare
me
all
this
could
n
t
you
see
i
was
idle
distracted
dissipated
dissipated
my
dear
son
hudson
repeated
that
s
over
for
the
present
but
could
n
t
you
see
could
n
t
mary
see
that
i
was
in
a
damnably
bad
way
i
have
no
doubt
miss
garland
saw
said
rowland
mary
has
said
nothing
cried
hudson
oh
she
s
a
fine
girl
rowland
said
have
you
done
anything
that
will
hurt
poor
mary
hudson
asked
i
have
only
been
thinking
night
and
day
of
another
woman
hudson
dropped
helplessly
into
her
seat
again
oh
dear
dear
had
n
t
we
better
go
home
not
to
get
out
of
her
way
roderick
said
she
has
started
on
a
career
of
her
own
and
she
does
n
t
care
a
straw
for
me
my
head
was
filled
with
her
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
would
have
sacrificed
everything
to
her
you
mary
mallet
my
work
my
fortune
my
future
my
honor
i
was
in
a
fine
state
eh
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
giving
you
good
news
but
i
m
telling
the
simple
literal
truth
so
that
you
may
know
why
i
have
gone
to
the
dogs
she
pretended
to
care
greatly
for
all
this
and
to
be
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
in
return
she
had
a
magnificent
chance
for
she
was
being
forced
into
a
mercenary
marriage
with
a
man
she
detested
she
led
me
to
believe
that
she
would
give
this
up
and
break
short
off
and
keep
herself
free
and
sacred
and
pure
for
me
this
was
a
great
honor
and
you
may
believe
that
i
valued
it
it
turned
my
head
and
i
lived
only
to
see
my
happiness
come
to
pass
she
did
everything
to
encourage
me
to
hope
it
would
everything
that
her
infernal
coquetry
and
falsity
could
oh
i
say
this
is
too
much
rowland
broke
out
do
you
defend
her
roderick
cried
with
a
renewal
of
his
passion
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
she
gave
me
no
hopes
he
had
been
speaking
with
growing
bitterness
quite
losing
sight
of
his
mother
s
pain
and
bewilderment
in
the
passionate
joy
of
publishing
his
wrongs
since
he
was
hurt
he
must
cry
out
since
he
was
in
pain
he
must
scatter
his
pain
abroad
of
his
never
thinking
of
others
save
as
they
spoke
and
moved
from
his
cue
as
it
were
this
extraordinary
insensibility
to
the
injurious
effects
of
his
eloquence
was
a
capital
example
the
more
so
as
the
motive
of
his
eloquence
was
never
an
appeal
for
sympathy
or
compassion
things
to
which
he
seemed
perfectly
indifferent
and
of
which
he
could
make
no
use
the
great
and
characteristic
point
with
him
was
the
perfect
absoluteness
of
his
own
emotions
and
experience
he
never
saw
himself
as
part
of
a
whole
only
as
the
isolated
individual
rejoicing
or
raging
as
the
case
might
be
but
needing
in
any
case
absolutely
to
affirm
himself
all
this
to
rowland
was
ancient
history
but
his
perception
of
it
stirred
within
him
afresh
at
the
sight
of
roderick
s
sense
of
having
been
betrayed
that
he
under
the
circumstances
should
not
in
fairness
be
the
first
to
lodge
a
complaint
of
betrayal
was
a
point
to
which
at
his
leisure
rowland
was
of
course
capable
of
rendering
impartial
justice
but
roderick
s
present
desperation
was
so
peremptory
that
it
imposed
itself
on
one
s
sympathies
do
you
pretend
to
say
he
went
on
that
she
did
n
t
lead
me
along
to
the
very
edge
of
fulfillment
and
stupefy
me
with
all
that
she
suffered
me
to
believe
all
that
she
sacredly
promised
it
amused
her
to
do
it
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
she
really
meant
she
never
meant
to
be
sincere
she
never
dreamed
she
could
be
she
s
a
ravenous
flirt
and
why
a
flirt
is
a
flirt
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
can
t
understand
playing
with
those
matters
for
me
they
re
serious
whether
i
take
them
up
or
lay
them
down
i
don
t
see
what
s
in
your
head
rowland
to
attempt
to
defend
miss
light
you
were
the
first
to
cry
out
against
her
you
told
me
she
was
dangerous
and
i
you
you
were
right
you
re
always
right
she
s
as
cold
and
false
and
heartless
as
she
s
beautiful
and
she
has
sold
her
heartless
beauty
to
the
highest
bidder
i
hope
he
knows
what
he
gets
oh
my
son
cried
hudson
plaintively
how
could
you
ever
care
for
such
a
dreadful
creature
it
would
take
long
to
tell
you
dear
mother
rowland
s
sympathy
and
compassion
for
christina
was
still
throbbing
in
his
mind
and
he
felt
that
in
loyalty
to
it
he
must
say
a
word
for
her
you
believed
in
her
too
much
at
first
he
declared
and
you
believe
in
her
too
little
roderick
looked
at
him
with
eyes
almost
lurid
beneath
lowering
brows
she
is
an
angel
then
after
all
that
s
what
you
want
to
prove
he
cried
that
s
consoling
for
me
who
have
lost
her
you
re
always
right
i
say
but
dear
friend
in
mercy
be
wrong
for
once
oh
yes
mallet
be
merciful
said
hudson
in
a
tone
which
for
all
its
gentleness
made
rowland
stare
the
poor
fellow
s
stare
covered
a
great
deal
of
concentrated
wonder
and
apprehension
a
presentiment
of
what
a
small
sweet
feeble
elderly
lady
might
be
capable
of
in
the
way
of
suddenly
generated
animosity
there
was
no
space
in
hudson
s
tiny
maternal
mind
for
complications
of
feeling
and
one
emotion
existed
only
by
turning
another
over
flat
and
perching
on
top
of
it
she
was
evidently
not
following
roderick
at
all
in
his
dusky
aberrations
sitting
without
in
dismay
she
only
saw
that
all
was
darkness
and
trouble
and
as
roderick
s
glory
had
now
quite
outstripped
her
powers
of
imagination
and
urged
him
beyond
her
jurisdiction
so
that
he
had
become
a
thing
too
precious
and
sacred
for
blame
she
found
it
infinitely
comfortable
to
lay
the
burden
of
their
common
affliction
upon
rowland
s
broad
shoulders
had
he
not
promised
to
make
them
all
rich
and
happy
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
rowland
felt
as
if
his
trials
were
in
a
sense
only
beginning
had
n
t
you
better
forget
all
this
my
dear
hudson
said
had
n
t
you
better
just
quietly
attend
to
your
work
work
madame
cried
roderick
my
work
s
over
i
can
t
work
i
have
n
t
worked
all
winter
if
i
were
fit
for
anything
this
sentimental
collapse
would
have
been
just
the
thing
to
cure
me
of
my
apathy
and
break
the
spell
of
my
idleness
but
there
s
a
perfect
vacuum
here
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
it
s
bigger
than
ever
it
grows
bigger
every
hour
i
m
sure
you
have
made
a
beautiful
likeness
of
your
poor
little
mother
said
hudson
coaxingly
i
had
done
nothing
before
and
i
have
done
nothing
since
i
quarreled
with
an
excellent
man
the
other
day
from
mere
exasperation
of
my
nerves
and
threw
away
five
thousand
dollars
threw
away
five
thousand
dollars
roderick
had
been
wandering
among
formidable
abstractions
and
allusions
too
dark
to
penetrate
but
here
was
a
concrete
fact
lucidly
stated
and
poor
hudson
for
a
moment
looked
it
in
the
face
she
repeated
her
son
s
words
a
third
time
with
a
gasping
murmur
and
then
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
roderick
went
to
her
sat
down
beside
her
put
his
arm
round
her
fixed
his
eyes
coldly
on
the
floor
and
waited
for
her
to
weep
herself
out
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
sobbed
she
said
not
a
word
she
made
no
attempt
to
scold
but
the
desolation
of
her
tears
was
overwhelming
it
lasted
some
time
too
long
for
rowland
s
courage
he
had
stood
silent
wishing
simply
to
appear
very
respectful
but
the
elation
that
was
mentioned
a
while
since
had
utterly
ebbed
and
he
found
his
situation
intolerable
he
walked
away
not
perhaps
on
tiptoe
but
with
a
total
absence
of
bravado
in
his
tread
the
next
day
while
he
was
at
home
the
servant
brought
him
the
card
of
a
visitor
he
read
with
surprise
the
name
of
hudson
and
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
he
found
her
in
his
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
son
and
looking
very
pale
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
and
her
lips
tightly
compressed
her
advent
puzzled
him
and
it
was
not
for
some
time
that
he
began
to
understand
the
motive
of
it
roderick
s
countenance
threw
no
light
upon
it
but
roderick
s
countenance
full
of
light
as
it
was
in
a
way
itself
had
never
thrown
light
upon
anything
he
had
not
been
in
rowland
s
rooms
for
several
weeks
and
he
immediately
began
to
look
at
those
of
his
own
works
that
adorned
them
he
lost
himself
in
silent
contemplation
hudson
had
evidently
armed
herself
with
dignity
and
so
far
as
she
might
she
meant
to
be
impressive
her
success
may
be
measured
by
the
fact
that
rowland
s
whole
attention
centred
in
the
fear
of
seeing
her
begin
to
weep
she
told
him
that
she
had
come
to
him
for
practical
advice
she
begged
to
remind
him
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
where
were
they
to
go
please
what
were
they
to
do
rowland
glanced
at
roderick
but
roderick
had
his
back
turned
and
was
gazing
at
his
adam
with
the
intensity
with
which
he
might
have
examined
michael
angelo
s
moses
roderick
says
he
does
n
t
know
he
does
n
t
care
hudson
said
he
leaves
it
entirely
to
many
another
man
in
rowland
s
place
would
have
greeted
this
information
with
an
irate
and
sarcastic
laugh
and
told
his
visitors
that
he
thanked
them
infinitely
for
their
confidence
but
that
really
as
things
stood
now
they
must
settle
these
matters
between
themselves
many
another
man
might
have
so
demeaned
himself
even
if
like
rowland
he
had
been
in
love
with
mary
garland
and
pressingly
conscious
that
her
destiny
was
also
part
of
the
question
but
rowland
swallowed
all
hilarity
and
all
sarcasm
and
let
himself
seriously
consider
hudson
s
petition
his
wits
however
were
but
indifferently
at
his
command
they
were
dulled
by
his
sense
of
the
inexpressible
change
in
hudson
s
attitude
her
visit
was
evidently
intended
as
a
formal
reminder
of
the
responsiblities
rowland
had
worn
so
lightly
hudson
was
doubtless
too
sincerely
humble
a
person
to
suppose
that
if
he
had
been
recreant
to
his
vows
of
vigilance
and
tenderness
her
still
small
presence
would
operate
as
a
chastisement
but
by
some
diminutive
logical
process
of
her
own
she
had
convinced
herself
that
she
had
been
weakly
trustful
and
that
she
had
suffered
rowland
to
think
too
meanly
not
only
of
her
understanding
but
of
her
social
consequence
a
visit
in
her
best
gown
would
have
an
admonitory
effect
as
regards
both
of
these
attributes
it
would
cancel
some
favors
received
and
show
him
that
she
was
no
such
fool
these
were
the
reflections
of
a
very
shy
woman
who
determining
for
once
in
her
life
to
hold
up
her
head
was
perhaps
carrying
it
a
trifle
extravagantly
you
know
we
have
very
little
money
to
spend
she
said
as
rowland
remained
silent
roderick
tells
me
that
he
has
debts
and
nothing
at
all
to
pay
them
with
he
says
i
must
write
to
striker
to
sell
my
house
for
what
it
will
bring
and
send
me
out
the
money
when
the
money
comes
i
must
give
it
to
him
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
dreadful
my
house
is
all
i
have
but
that
is
all
roderick
will
say
we
must
be
very
before
this
speech
was
finished
hudson
s
voice
had
begun
to
quaver
softly
and
her
face
which
had
no
capacity
for
the
expression
of
superior
wisdom
to
look
as
humbly
appealing
as
before
rowland
turned
to
roderick
and
spoke
like
a
come
away
from
those
statues
and
sit
down
here
and
listen
to
me
roderick
started
but
obeyed
with
the
most
graceful
docility
what
do
you
propose
to
your
mother
to
do
rowland
asked
propose
said
roderick
absently
oh
i
propose
the
tone
the
glance
the
gesture
with
which
this
was
said
were
horribly
irritating
though
obviously
without
the
slightest
intention
of
being
so
and
for
an
instant
an
imprecation
rose
to
rowland
s
lips
but
he
checked
it
and
he
was
afterwards
glad
he
had
done
so
you
must
do
something
he
said
choose
select
decide
my
dear
rowland
how
you
talk
roderick
cried
the
very
point
of
the
matter
is
that
i
can
t
do
anything
i
will
do
as
i
m
told
but
i
don
t
call
that
doing
we
must
leave
rome
i
suppose
though
i
don
t
see
why
we
have
got
no
money
and
you
have
to
pay
money
on
the
hudson
surreptitiously
wrung
her
hands
listen
to
him
please
she
cried
not
leave
rome
when
we
have
staid
here
later
than
any
christians
ever
did
before
it
s
this
dreadful
place
that
has
made
us
so
that
s
very
true
said
roderick
serenely
if
i
had
not
come
to
rome
i
would
n
t
have
risen
and
if
i
had
not
risen
i
should
n
t
have
fallen
fallen
murmured
hudson
just
hear
him
i
will
do
anything
you
say
rowland
roderick
added
i
will
do
anything
you
want
i
have
not
been
unkind
to
my
mother
have
i
mother
i
was
unkind
yesterday
without
meaning
it
for
after
all
all
that
had
to
be
said
murder
will
out
and
my
low
spirits
can
t
be
hidden
but
we
talked
it
over
and
made
it
up
did
n
t
we
it
seemed
to
me
we
did
let
rowland
decide
it
mother
whatever
he
suggests
will
be
the
right
and
roderick
who
had
hardly
removed
his
eyes
from
the
statues
got
up
again
and
went
back
to
look
at
them
hudson
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
floor
in
silence
there
was
not
a
trace
in
roderick
s
face
or
in
his
voice
of
the
bitterness
of
his
emotion
of
the
day
before
and
not
a
hint
of
his
having
the
lightest
weight
upon
his
conscience
he
looked
at
rowland
with
his
frank
luminous
eye
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
difference
of
opinion
between
them
as
if
each
had
ever
been
for
both
unalterably
and
both
for
each
rowland
had
received
a
few
days
before
a
letter
from
a
lady
of
his
acquaintance
a
worthy
scotswoman
domiciled
in
a
villa
upon
one
of
the
hills
near
florence
she
held
her
apartment
in
the
villa
upon
a
long
lease
and
she
enjoyed
for
a
sum
not
worth
mentioning
the
possession
of
an
extraordinary
number
of
noble
rooms
with
ceilings
vaulted
and
frescoed
and
barred
windows
commanding
the
loveliest
view
in
the
world
she
was
a
needy
and
thrifty
spinster
who
never
hesitated
to
declare
that
the
lovely
view
was
all
very
well
but
that
for
her
own
part
she
lived
in
the
villa
for
cheapness
and
that
if
she
had
a
clear
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
she
would
go
and
really
enjoy
life
near
her
sister
a
baronet
s
lady
at
glasgow
she
was
now
proposing
to
make
a
visit
to
that
exhilarating
city
and
she
desired
to
turn
an
honest
penny
by
for
a
few
weeks
her
historic
italian
chambers
the
terms
on
which
she
occupied
them
enabled
her
to
ask
a
rent
almost
jocosely
small
and
she
begged
rowland
to
do
what
she
called
a
little
genteel
advertising
for
her
would
he
say
a
good
word
for
her
rooms
to
his
numerous
friends
as
they
left
rome
he
said
a
good
word
for
them
now
to
hudson
and
told
her
in
dollars
and
cents
how
cheap
a
summer
s
lodging
she
might
secure
he
dwelt
upon
the
fact
that
she
would
strike
a
truce
with
hote
and
have
a
cook
of
her
own
amenable
possibly
to
instruction
in
the
northampton
mysteries
he
had
touched
a
tender
chord
hudson
became
almost
cheerful
her
sentiments
upon
the
hote
system
and
upon
foreign
household
habits
generally
were
remarkable
and
if
we
had
space
for
it
would
repay
analysis
and
the
idea
of
reclaiming
a
lost
soul
to
the
puritanic
canons
of
cookery
quite
lightened
the
burden
of
her
depression
while
rowland
set
forth
his
case
roderick
was
slowly
walking
round
the
magnificent
adam
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
rowland
waited
for
him
to
manifest
an
interest
in
their
discussion
but
the
statue
seemed
to
fascinate
him
and
he
remained
calmly
heedless
rowland
was
a
practical
man
he
possessed
conspicuously
what
is
called
the
sense
of
detail
he
entered
into
hudson
s
position
minutely
and
told
her
exactly
why
it
seemed
good
that
she
should
remove
immediately
to
the
florentine
villa
she
received
his
advice
with
great
frigidity
looking
hard
at
the
floor
and
sighing
like
a
person
well
on
her
guard
against
an
insidious
optimism
but
she
had
nothing
better
to
propose
and
rowland
received
her
permission
to
write
to
his
friend
that
he
had
let
the
rooms
roderick
assented
to
this
decision
without
either
sighs
or
smiles
a
florentine
villa
is
a
good
thing
he
said
i
am
at
your
i
m
sure
i
hope
you
ll
get
better
there
moaned
his
mother
gathering
her
shawl
together
roderick
laid
one
hand
on
her
arm
and
with
the
other
pointed
to
rowland
s
statues
better
or
worse
remember
this
i
did
those
things
he
said
hudson
gazed
at
them
vaguely
and
rowland
said
remember
it
yourself
they
are
horribly
good
said
roderick
rowland
solemnly
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
but
as
the
others
were
going
a
last
light
pulsation
of
the
sense
of
undischarged
duty
led
him
to
address
to
roderick
a
few
words
of
parting
advice
you
ll
find
the
villa
pandolfini
very
delightful
very
comfortable
he
said
you
ought
to
be
very
contented
there
whether
you
work
or
whether
you
loaf
it
s
a
place
for
an
artist
to
be
happy
in
i
hope
you
will
i
hope
i
may
said
roderick
with
a
magnificent
smile
when
we
meet
again
have
something
to
show
when
we
meet
again
where
the
deuce
are
you
going
roderick
demanded
oh
i
hardly
know
over
the
over
the
alps
you
re
going
to
leave
me
roderick
cried
rowland
had
most
distinctly
meant
to
leave
him
but
his
resolution
immediately
wavered
he
glanced
at
hudson
and
saw
that
her
eyebrows
were
lifted
and
her
lips
parted
in
soft
irony
she
seemed
to
accuse
him
of
a
craven
shirking
of
trouble
to
demand
of
him
to
repair
his
cruel
havoc
in
her
life
by
a
solemn
renewal
of
zeal
but
roderick
s
expectations
were
the
oddest
such
as
they
were
rowland
asked
himself
why
he
should
n
t
make
a
bargain
with
them
you
desire
me
to
go
with
you
he
asked
if
you
don
t
go
i
won
t
that
s
all
how
in
the
world
shall
i
get
through
the
summer
without
you
how
will
you
get
through
it
with
me
that
s
the
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
the
future
is
a
dead
blank
but
without
you
it
s
not
a
blank
it
s
certain
damnation
mercy
mercy
murmured
hudson
rowland
made
an
effort
to
stand
firm
and
for
a
moment
succeeded
if
i
go
with
you
will
you
try
to
work
roderick
up
to
this
moment
had
been
looking
as
unperturbed
as
if
the
deep
agitation
of
the
day
before
were
a
thing
of
the
remote
past
but
at
these
words
his
face
changed
formidably
he
flushed
and
scowled
and
all
his
passion
returned
try
to
work
he
cried
try
try
work
work
in
god
s
name
don
t
talk
that
way
or
you
ll
drive
me
mad
do
you
suppose
i
m
trying
not
to
work
do
you
suppose
i
stand
rotting
here
for
the
fun
of
it
don
t
you
suppose
i
would
try
to
work
for
myself
before
i
tried
for
you
mr
mallet
cried
hudson
piteously
will
you
leave
me
alone
with
this
rowland
turned
to
her
and
informed
her
gently
that
he
would
go
with
her
to
florence
after
he
had
so
pledged
himself
he
thought
not
at
all
of
the
pain
of
his
position
as
mediator
between
the
mother
s
resentful
grief
and
the
son
s
incurable
weakness
he
drank
deep
only
of
the
satisfaction
of
not
separating
from
mary
garland
if
the
future
was
a
blank
to
roderick
it
was
hardly
less
so
to
himself
he
had
at
moments
a
lively
foreboding
of
impending
calamity
he
paid
it
no
especial
deference
but
it
made
him
feel
indisposed
to
take
the
future
into
his
account
when
on
his
going
to
take
leave
of
madame
grandoni
this
lady
asked
at
what
time
he
would
come
back
to
rome
he
answered
that
he
was
coming
back
either
never
or
forever
when
she
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
said
he
really
could
n
t
tell
her
and
parted
from
her
with
much
genuine
emotion
the
more
so
doubtless
that
she
blessed
him
in
a
quite
loving
maternal
fashion
and
told
him
she
honestly
believed
him
to
be
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
the
villa
pandolfini
stood
directly
upon
a
small
piazza
on
the
top
of
a
hill
which
sloped
straight
from
one
of
the
gates
of
florence
it
offered
to
the
outer
world
a
long
rather
low
facade
colored
a
dull
dark
yellow
and
pierced
with
windows
of
various
sizes
no
one
of
which
save
those
on
the
ground
floor
was
on
the
same
level
with
any
other
within
it
had
a
great
cool
gray
cortile
with
high
light
arches
around
it
doors
of
majestic
altitude
opening
out
of
it
and
a
beautiful
mediaeval
well
on
one
side
of
it
hudson
s
rooms
opened
into
a
small
garden
supported
on
immense
substructions
which
were
planted
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hill
as
it
sloped
steeply
away
this
garden
was
a
charming
place
its
south
wall
was
curtained
with
a
dense
orange
vine
a
dozen
offered
you
their
shade
and
over
the
low
parapet
the
soft
grave
tuscan
landscape
kept
you
company
the
rooms
themselves
were
as
high
as
chapels
and
as
cool
as
royal
sepulchres
silence
peace
and
security
seemed
to
abide
in
the
ancient
house
and
make
it
an
ideal
refuge
for
aching
hearts
hudson
had
a
stunted
maddalena
who
wore
a
crimson
handkerchief
passed
over
her
coarse
black
locks
and
tied
under
her
sharp
pertinacious
chin
and
a
smile
which
was
as
brilliant
as
a
prolonged
flash
of
lightning
she
smiled
at
everything
in
life
especially
the
things
she
did
n
t
like
and
which
kept
her
talent
for
mendacity
in
healthy
exercise
a
glance
a
word
a
motion
was
sufficient
to
make
her
show
her
teeth
at
you
like
a
cheerful
this
inexpugnable
smile
constituted
her
whole
vocabulary
in
her
dealings
with
her
melancholy
mistress
to
whom
she
had
been
bequeathed
by
the
late
occupant
of
the
apartment
and
who
to
rowland
s
satisfaction
promised
to
be
diverted
from
her
maternal
sorrows
by
the
still
deeper
perplexities
of
maddalena
s
theory
of
roasting
sweeping
and
rowland
took
rooms
at
a
villa
a
trifle
nearer
florence
whence
in
the
summer
mornings
he
had
five
minutes
walk
in
the
sharp
black
projected
by
winding
walls
to
join
his
friends
the
life
at
the
villa
pandolfini
when
it
had
fairly
defined
itself
was
tranquil
and
monotonous
but
it
might
have
borrowed
from
exquisite
circumstance
an
absorbing
charm
if
a
sensible
shadow
rested
upon
it
this
was
because
it
had
an
inherent
vice
it
was
feigning
a
repose
which
it
very
scantily
felt
roderick
had
lost
no
time
in
giving
the
full
measure
of
his
uncompromising
chagrin
and
as
he
was
the
central
figure
of
the
little
group
as
he
held
its
all
in
his
own
hand
it
reflected
faithfully
the
eclipse
of
his
own
genius
no
one
had
ventured
upon
the
cheerful
commonplace
of
saying
that
the
change
of
air
and
of
scene
would
restore
his
spirits
this
would
have
had
under
the
circumstances
altogether
too
silly
a
sound
the
change
in
question
had
done
nothing
of
the
sort
and
his
companions
had
at
least
the
comfort
of
their
perspicacity
an
essential
spring
had
dried
up
within
him
and
there
was
no
visible
spiritual
law
for
making
it
flow
again
he
was
rarely
violent
he
expressed
little
of
the
irritation
and
ennui
that
he
must
have
constantly
felt
it
was
as
if
he
believed
that
a
spiritual
miracle
for
his
redemption
was
just
barely
possible
and
was
therefore
worth
waiting
for
the
most
that
one
could
do
however
was
to
wait
grimly
and
doggedly
suppressing
an
imprecation
as
from
time
to
time
one
looked
at
one
s
watch
an
attitude
of
positive
urbanity
toward
life
was
not
to
be
expected
it
was
doing
one
s
duty
to
hold
one
s
tongue
and
keep
one
s
hands
off
one
s
own
windpipe
and
other
people
s
roderick
had
long
silences
fits
of
profound
lethargy
almost
of
stupefaction
he
used
to
sit
in
the
garden
by
the
hour
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
legs
outstretched
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
blinding
summer
sky
he
would
gather
a
dozen
books
about
him
tumble
them
out
on
the
ground
take
one
into
his
lap
and
leave
it
with
the
pages
unturned
these
moods
would
alternate
with
hours
of
extreme
restlessness
during
which
he
mysteriously
absented
himself
he
bore
the
heat
of
the
italian
summer
like
a
salamander
and
used
to
start
off
at
high
noon
for
long
walks
over
the
hills
he
often
went
down
into
florence
rambled
through
her
close
dim
streets
and
lounged
away
mornings
in
the
churches
and
galleries
on
many
of
these
occasions
rowland
bore
him
company
for
they
were
the
times
when
he
was
most
like
his
former
self
before
michael
angelo
s
statues
and
the
pictures
of
the
early
tuscans
he
quite
forgot
his
own
infelicities
and
picked
up
the
thread
of
his
old
aesthetic
loquacity
he
had
a
particular
fondness
for
andrea
del
sarto
and
affirmed
that
if
he
had
been
a
painter
he
would
have
taken
the
author
of
the
madonna
del
sacco
for
his
model
he
found
in
florence
some
of
his
roman
friends
and
went
down
on
certain
evenings
to
meet
them
more
than
once
he
asked
mary
garland
to
go
with
him
into
town
and
showed
her
the
things
he
most
cared
for
he
had
some
modeling
clay
brought
up
to
the
villa
and
deposited
in
a
room
suitable
for
his
work
but
when
this
had
been
done
he
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
the
clay
never
was
touched
his
eye
was
heavy
and
his
hand
cold
and
his
mother
put
up
a
secret
prayer
that
he
might
be
induced
to
see
a
doctor
but
on
a
certain
occasion
when
her
prayer
became
articulate
he
had
a
great
outburst
of
anger
and
begged
her
to
know
once
for
all
that
his
health
was
better
than
it
had
ever
been
on
the
whole
and
most
of
the
time
he
was
a
sad
spectacle
he
looked
so
hopelessly
idle
if
he
was
not
querulous
and
bitter
it
was
because
he
had
taken
an
extraordinary
vow
not
to
be
a
vow
heroic
for
him
a
vow
which
those
who
knew
him
well
had
the
tenderness
to
appreciate
talking
with
him
was
like
skating
on
thin
ice
and
his
companions
had
a
constant
mental
vision
of
spots
designated
this
was
a
difficult
time
for
rowland
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
endure
it
to
the
end
but
that
it
must
be
his
last
adventure
of
the
kind
hudson
divided
her
time
between
looking
askance
at
her
son
with
her
hands
tightly
clasped
about
her
as
if
she
were
wringing
it
dry
of
the
last
hour
s
tears
and
turning
her
eyes
much
more
directly
upon
rowland
in
the
mutest
the
feeblest
the
most
intolerable
reproachfulness
she
never
phrased
her
accusations
but
he
felt
that
in
the
unillumined
void
of
the
poor
lady
s
mind
they
loomed
up
like
monsters
her
demeanor
caused
him
the
acutest
suffering
and
if
at
the
outset
of
his
enterprise
he
had
seen
how
dimly
soever
one
of
those
plaintive
in
the
opposite
scale
the
brilliancy
of
roderick
s
promises
would
have
counted
for
little
they
made
their
way
to
the
softest
spot
in
his
conscience
and
kept
it
chronically
aching
if
hudson
had
been
loquacious
and
vulgar
he
would
have
borne
even
a
less
valid
persecution
with
greater
fortitude
but
somehow
neat
and
noiseless
and
dismally
as
she
sat
there
keeping
her
grievance
green
with
her
tears
her
displeasure
conveyed
an
overwhelming
imputation
of
brutality
he
felt
like
a
reckless
trustee
who
has
speculated
with
the
widow
s
mite
and
is
haunted
with
the
reflection
of
ruin
that
he
sees
in
her
tearful
eyes
he
did
everything
conceivable
to
be
polite
to
hudson
and
to
treat
her
with
distinguished
deference
perhaps
his
exasperated
nerves
made
him
overshoot
the
mark
and
rendered
his
civilities
a
trifle
peremptory
she
seemed
capable
of
believing
that
he
was
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
her
she
would
have
thought
him
cruelly
recreant
if
he
had
suddenly
departed
in
desperation
and
yet
she
gave
him
no
visible
credit
for
his
constancy
women
are
said
by
some
authorities
to
be
cruel
i
don
t
know
how
true
this
is
but
it
may
at
least
be
pertinent
to
remark
that
hudson
was
very
much
of
a
woman
it
often
seemed
to
rowland
that
he
had
too
decidedly
forfeited
his
freedom
and
that
there
was
something
positively
grotesque
in
a
man
of
his
age
and
circumstances
living
in
such
a
moral
bondage
but
mary
garland
had
helped
him
before
and
she
helped
him
now
helped
him
not
less
than
he
had
assured
himself
she
would
when
he
found
himself
drifting
to
florence
yet
her
help
was
rendered
in
the
same
unconscious
unacknowledged
fashion
as
before
there
was
no
explicit
change
in
their
relations
after
that
distressing
scene
in
rome
which
had
immediately
preceded
their
departure
it
was
of
course
impossible
that
there
should
not
be
on
miss
garland
s
part
some
frankness
of
allusion
to
roderick
s
sad
condition
she
had
been
present
the
reader
will
remember
during
only
half
of
his
unsparing
confession
and
rowland
had
not
seen
her
confronted
with
any
absolute
proof
of
roderick
s
passion
for
christina
light
but
he
knew
that
she
knew
far
too
much
for
her
happiness
roderick
had
told
him
shortly
after
their
settlement
at
the
villa
pandolfini
that
he
had
had
a
tremendous
talk
with
his
cousin
rowland
asked
no
questions
about
it
he
preferred
not
to
know
what
had
passed
between
them
if
their
interview
had
been
purely
painful
he
wished
to
ignore
it
for
miss
garland
s
sake
and
if
it
had
sown
the
seeds
of
reconciliation
he
wished
to
close
his
eyes
to
it
for
his
own
for
the
sake
of
that
unshaped
idea
forever
dismissed
and
yet
forever
present
which
hovered
in
the
background
of
his
consciousness
with
a
hanging
head
as
it
were
and
yet
an
unshamed
glance
and
whose
lightest
motions
were
an
effectual
bribe
to
patience
was
the
engagement
broken
rowland
wondered
yet
without
asking
but
it
hardly
mattered
for
if
as
was
more
than
probable
miss
garland
had
peremptorily
released
her
cousin
her
own
heart
had
by
no
means
recovered
its
liberty
it
was
very
certain
to
rowland
s
mind
that
if
she
had
given
him
up
she
had
by
no
means
ceased
to
care
for
him
passionately
and
that
to
exhaust
her
charity
for
his
weaknesses
roderick
would
have
as
the
phrase
is
a
long
row
to
hoe
she
spoke
of
roderick
as
she
might
have
done
of
a
person
suffering
from
a
serious
malady
which
demanded
much
tenderness
but
if
rowland
had
found
it
possible
to
accuse
her
of
dishonesty
he
would
have
said
now
that
she
believed
appreciably
less
than
she
pretended
to
in
her
victim
s
being
an
involuntary
patient
there
are
women
whose
love
is
and
patronizing
and
who
rather
prefer
a
weak
man
because
he
gives
them
a
comfortable
sense
of
strength
it
did
not
in
the
least
please
rowland
to
believe
that
mary
garland
was
one
of
these
for
he
held
that
such
women
were
only
males
in
petticoats
and
he
was
convinced
that
miss
garland
s
heart
was
constructed
after
the
most
perfect
feminine
model
that
she
was
a
very
different
woman
from
christina
light
did
not
at
all
prove
that
she
was
less
a
woman
and
if
the
princess
casamassima
had
gone
up
into
a
high
place
to
publish
her
disrelish
of
a
man
who
lacked
the
virile
will
it
was
very
certain
that
mary
garland
was
not
a
person
to
put
up
at
any
point
with
what
might
be
called
the
princess
s
leavings
it
was
christina
s
constant
practice
to
remind
you
of
the
complexity
of
her
character
of
the
subtlety
of
her
mind
of
her
troublous
faculty
of
seeing
everything
in
a
dozen
different
lights
mary
garland
had
never
pretended
not
to
be
simple
but
rowland
had
a
theory
that
she
had
really
a
more
multitudinous
sense
of
human
things
a
more
delicate
imagination
and
a
finer
instinct
of
character
she
did
you
the
honors
of
her
mind
with
a
grace
far
less
regal
but
was
not
that
faculty
of
quite
as
remarkable
an
adjustment
if
in
poor
christina
s
strangely
commingled
nature
there
was
circle
within
circle
and
depth
beneath
depth
it
was
to
be
believed
that
mary
garland
though
she
did
not
amuse
herself
with
dropping
stones
into
her
soul
and
waiting
to
hear
them
fall
laid
quite
as
many
sources
of
spiritual
life
under
contribution
she
had
believed
roderick
was
a
fine
fellow
when
she
bade
him
farewell
beneath
the
northampton
elms
and
this
belief
to
her
young
strenuous
concentrated
imagination
had
meant
many
things
if
it
was
to
grow
cold
it
would
be
because
disenchantment
had
become
total
and
won
the
battle
at
each
successive
point
miss
garland
had
even
in
her
face
and
carriage
something
of
the
preoccupied
and
wearied
look
of
a
person
who
is
watching
at
a
roderick
s
broken
fortunes
his
dead
ambitions
were
a
cruel
burden
to
the
heart
of
a
girl
who
had
believed
that
he
possessed
genius
and
supposed
that
genius
was
to
one
s
spiritual
economy
what
full
pockets
were
to
one
s
domestic
and
yet
with
her
rowland
never
felt
as
with
hudson
that
undercurrent
of
reproach
and
bitterness
toward
himself
that
impertinent
implication
that
he
had
defrauded
her
of
happiness
was
this
justice
in
miss
garland
or
was
it
mercy
the
answer
would
have
been
difficult
for
she
had
almost
let
rowland
feel
before
leaving
rome
that
she
liked
him
well
enough
to
forgive
him
an
injury
it
was
partly
rowland
fancied
that
there
were
occasional
lapses
deep
and
sweet
in
her
sense
of
injury
when
on
arriving
at
florence
she
saw
the
place
rowland
had
brought
them
to
in
their
trouble
she
had
given
him
a
look
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
that
had
seemed
not
only
a
remission
of
guilt
but
a
positive
reward
this
happened
in
the
court
of
the
villa
the
large
gray
quadrangle
overstretched
from
edge
to
edge
of
the
roof
by
the
soft
italian
sky
mary
had
felt
on
the
spot
the
sovereign
charm
of
the
place
it
was
reflected
in
her
deeply
intelligent
glance
and
rowland
immediately
accused
himself
of
not
having
done
the
villa
justice
miss
garland
took
a
mighty
fancy
to
florence
and
used
to
look
down
wistfully
at
the
towered
city
from
the
windows
and
garden
roderick
having
now
no
pretext
for
not
being
her
cicerone
rowland
was
no
longer
at
liberty
as
he
had
been
in
rome
to
propose
frequent
excursions
to
her
roderick
s
own
invitations
however
were
not
frequent
and
rowland
more
than
once
ventured
to
introduce
her
to
a
gallery
or
a
church
these
expeditions
were
not
so
blissful
to
his
sense
as
the
rambles
they
had
taken
together
in
rome
for
his
companion
only
half
surrendered
herself
to
her
enjoyment
and
seemed
to
have
but
a
divided
attention
at
her
command
often
when
she
had
begun
with
looking
intently
at
a
picture
her
silence
after
an
interval
made
him
turn
and
glance
at
her
he
usually
found
that
if
she
was
looking
at
the
picture
still
she
was
not
seeing
it
her
eyes
were
fixed
but
her
thoughts
were
wandering
and
an
image
more
vivid
than
any
that
raphael
or
titian
had
drawn
had
superposed
itself
upon
the
canvas
she
asked
fewer
questions
than
before
and
seemed
to
have
lost
heart
for
consulting
and
encyclopaedias
from
time
to
time
however
she
uttered
a
deep
full
murmur
of
gratification
florence
in
midsummer
was
perfectly
void
of
travelers
and
the
dense
little
city
gave
forth
its
aesthetic
aroma
with
a
larger
frankness
as
the
nightingale
sings
when
the
listeners
have
departed
the
churches
were
deliciously
cool
but
the
gray
streets
were
stifling
and
the
great
polygons
of
pavement
as
hot
to
the
tread
as
molten
lava
rowland
who
suffered
from
intense
heat
would
have
found
all
this
uncomfortable
in
solitude
but
florence
had
never
charmed
him
so
completely
as
during
these
midsummer
strolls
with
his
preoccupied
companion
one
evening
they
had
arranged
to
go
on
the
morrow
to
the
academy
miss
garland
kept
her
appointment
but
as
soon
as
she
appeared
rowland
saw
that
something
painful
had
befallen
her
she
was
doing
her
best
to
look
at
her
ease
but
her
face
bore
the
marks
of
tears
rowland
told
her
that
he
was
afraid
she
was
ill
and
that
if
she
preferred
to
give
up
the
visit
to
florence
he
would
submit
with
what
grace
he
might
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
she
preferred
to
adhere
to
their
plan
i
am
not
well
she
presently
added
but
it
s
a
moral
malady
and
in
such
cases
i
consider
your
company
but
if
i
am
to
be
your
doctor
said
rowland
you
must
tell
me
how
your
illness
i
can
tell
you
very
little
it
began
with
hudson
being
unjust
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
now
i
am
already
better
i
mention
this
incident
because
it
confirmed
an
impression
of
rowland
s
from
which
he
had
derived
a
certain
consolation
he
knew
that
hudson
considered
her
son
s
passion
for
christina
light
a
very
regrettable
affair
but
he
suspected
that
her
manifest
compassion
had
been
all
for
roderick
and
not
in
the
least
for
mary
garland
she
was
fond
of
the
young
girl
but
she
had
valued
her
primarily
during
the
last
two
years
as
a
kind
of
assistant
priestess
at
roderick
s
shrine
roderick
had
honored
her
by
asking
her
to
become
his
wife
but
that
poor
mary
had
any
rights
in
consequence
hudson
was
quite
incapable
of
perceiving
her
sentiment
on
the
subject
was
of
course
not
very
vigorously
formulated
but
she
was
unprepared
to
admit
that
miss
garland
had
any
ground
for
complaint
roderick
was
very
unhappy
that
was
enough
and
mary
s
duty
was
to
join
her
patience
and
her
prayers
to
those
of
his
doting
mother
roderick
might
fall
in
love
with
whom
he
pleased
no
doubt
that
women
trained
in
the
mysterious
roman
arts
were
only
too
proud
and
too
happy
to
make
it
easy
for
him
and
it
was
very
presuming
in
poor
plain
mary
to
feel
any
personal
resentment
hudson
s
philosophy
was
of
too
narrow
a
scope
to
suggest
that
a
mother
may
forgive
where
a
mistress
can
not
and
she
thought
herself
greatly
aggrieved
that
miss
garland
was
not
so
disinterested
as
herself
she
was
ready
to
drop
dead
in
roderick
s
service
and
she
was
quite
capable
of
seeing
her
companion
falter
and
grow
faint
without
a
tremor
of
compassion
mary
apparently
had
given
some
intimation
of
her
belief
that
if
constancy
is
the
flower
of
devotion
reciprocity
is
the
guarantee
of
constancy
and
hudson
had
rebuked
her
failing
faith
and
called
it
cruelty
that
miss
garland
had
found
it
hard
to
reason
with
hudson
that
she
suffered
deeply
from
the
elder
lady
s
softly
bitter
imputations
and
that
in
short
he
had
companionship
in
misfortune
all
this
made
rowland
find
a
certain
luxury
in
his
discomfort
the
party
at
villa
pandolfini
used
to
sit
in
the
garden
in
the
evenings
which
rowland
almost
always
spent
with
them
their
entertainment
was
in
the
heavily
perfumed
air
in
the
dim
far
starlight
in
the
crenelated
tower
of
a
neighboring
villa
which
loomed
vaguely
above
them
in
the
warm
darkness
and
in
such
conversation
as
depressing
reflections
allowed
roderick
clad
always
in
white
roamed
about
like
a
restless
ghost
silent
for
the
most
part
but
making
from
time
to
time
a
brief
observation
characterized
by
the
most
fantastic
cynicism
roderick
s
contributions
to
the
conversation
were
indeed
always
so
fantastic
that
though
half
the
time
they
wearied
him
unspeakably
rowland
made
an
effort
to
treat
them
humorously
with
rowland
alone
roderick
talked
a
great
deal
more
often
about
things
related
to
his
own
work
or
about
artistic
and
aesthetic
matters
in
general
he
talked
as
well
as
ever
or
even
better
but
his
talk
always
ended
in
a
torrent
of
groans
and
curses
when
this
current
set
in
rowland
straightway
turned
his
back
or
stopped
his
ears
and
roderick
now
witnessed
these
movements
with
perfect
indifference
when
the
latter
was
absent
from
the
circle
in
the
garden
as
often
happened
rowland
knew
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
he
supposed
him
to
be
in
florence
but
he
never
learned
what
he
did
there
all
this
was
not
enlivening
but
with
an
even
muffled
tread
the
days
followed
each
other
and
brought
the
month
of
august
to
a
close
one
particular
evening
at
this
time
was
most
enchanting
there
was
a
perfect
moon
looking
so
extraordinarily
large
that
it
made
everything
its
light
fell
upon
seem
small
the
heat
was
tempered
by
a
soft
west
wind
and
the
wind
was
laden
with
the
odors
of
the
early
harvest
the
hills
the
vale
of
the
arno
the
shrunken
river
the
domes
of
florence
were
vaguely
effaced
by
the
dense
moonshine
they
looked
as
if
they
were
melting
out
of
sight
like
an
exorcised
vision
rowland
had
found
the
two
ladies
alone
at
the
villa
and
he
had
sat
with
them
for
an
hour
he
felt
absolutely
hushed
by
the
solemn
splendor
of
the
scene
but
he
had
risked
the
remark
that
whatever
life
might
yet
have
in
store
for
either
of
them
this
was
a
night
that
they
would
never
forget
it
s
a
night
to
remember
on
one
s
miss
garland
exclaimed
oh
mary
how
can
you
murmured
hudson
to
whom
this
savored
of
profanity
and
to
whose
shrinking
sense
indeed
the
accumulated
loveliness
of
the
night
seemed
to
have
something
shameless
and
defiant
they
were
silent
after
this
for
some
time
but
at
last
rowland
addressed
certain
idle
words
to
miss
garland
she
made
no
reply
and
he
turned
to
look
at
her
she
was
sitting
motionless
with
her
head
pressed
to
hudson
s
shoulder
and
the
latter
lady
was
gazing
at
him
through
the
silvered
dusk
with
a
look
which
gave
a
sort
of
spectral
solemnity
to
the
sad
weak
meaning
of
her
eyes
she
had
the
air
for
the
moment
of
a
little
old
malevolent
fairy
miss
garland
rowland
perceived
in
an
instant
was
not
absolutely
motionless
a
tremor
passed
through
her
figure
she
was
weeping
or
on
the
point
of
weeping
and
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
rowland
left
his
place
and
wandered
to
another
part
of
the
garden
wondering
at
the
motive
of
her
sudden
tears
of
women
s
sobs
in
general
he
had
a
sovereign
dread
but
these
somehow
gave
him
a
certain
pleasure
when
he
returned
to
his
place
miss
garland
had
raised
her
head
and
banished
her
tears
she
came
away
from
hudson
and
they
stood
for
a
short
time
leaning
against
the
parapet
it
seems
to
you
very
strange
i
suppose
said
rowland
that
there
should
be
any
trouble
in
such
a
world
as
i
used
to
think
she
answered
that
if
any
trouble
came
to
me
i
would
bear
it
like
a
stoic
but
that
was
at
home
where
things
don
t
speak
to
us
of
enjoyment
as
they
do
here
here
it
is
such
a
mixture
one
does
n
t
know
what
to
choose
what
to
believe
beauty
stands
there
beauty
such
as
this
night
and
this
place
and
all
this
sad
strange
summer
have
been
so
full
of
and
it
penetrates
to
one
s
soul
and
lodges
there
and
keeps
saying
that
man
was
not
made
to
suffer
but
to
enjoy
this
place
has
undermined
my
stoicism
but
shall
i
tell
you
i
feel
as
if
i
were
saying
something
sinful
i
love
it
if
it
is
sinful
i
absolve
you
said
rowland
in
so
far
as
i
have
power
we
are
made
i
suppose
both
to
suffer
and
to
enjoy
as
you
say
it
s
a
mixture
just
now
and
here
it
seems
a
peculiarly
strange
one
but
we
must
take
things
in
his
words
had
a
singular
aptness
for
he
had
hardly
uttered
them
when
roderick
came
out
from
the
house
evidently
in
his
darkest
mood
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
hard
at
the
view
it
s
a
very
beautiful
night
my
son
said
his
mother
going
to
him
timidly
and
touching
his
arm
he
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
and
let
it
stay
there
clasping
his
thick
locks
beautiful
he
cried
of
course
it
s
beautiful
everything
is
beautiful
everything
is
insolent
defiant
atrocious
with
beauty
nothing
is
ugly
but
me
me
and
my
poor
dead
brain
oh
my
dearest
son
pleaded
poor
hudson
don
t
you
feel
any
better
roderick
made
no
immediate
answer
but
at
last
he
spoke
in
a
different
voice
i
came
expressly
to
tell
you
that
you
need
n
t
trouble
yourselves
any
longer
to
wait
for
something
to
turn
up
nothing
will
turn
up
it
s
all
over
i
said
when
i
came
here
i
would
give
it
a
chance
i
have
given
it
a
chance
have
n
t
i
eh
have
n
t
i
rowland
it
s
no
use
the
thing
s
a
failure
do
with
me
now
what
you
please
i
recommend
you
to
set
me
up
there
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
shoot
i
feel
strongly
inclined
said
rowland
gravely
to
go
and
get
my
oh
mercy
on
us
what
language
cried
hudson
why
not
roderick
went
on
this
would
be
a
lovely
night
for
it
and
i
should
be
a
lucky
fellow
to
be
buried
in
this
garden
but
bury
me
alive
if
you
prefer
take
me
back
to
roderick
will
you
really
come
cried
his
mother
oh
yes
i
ll
go
i
might
as
well
be
there
as
anywhere
reverting
to
idiocy
and
living
upon
alms
i
can
do
nothing
with
all
this
perhaps
i
should
really
like
northampton
if
i
m
to
vegetate
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
can
do
it
there
better
than
oh
come
home
come
home
hudson
said
and
we
shall
all
be
safe
and
quiet
and
happy
my
dearest
son
come
home
with
your
poor
mother
let
us
go
then
and
go
quickly
hudson
flung
herself
upon
his
neck
for
gratitude
we
ll
go
she
cried
the
lord
is
very
good
to
me
mary
garland
said
nothing
to
this
but
she
looked
at
rowland
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
contain
a
kind
of
alarmed
appeal
rowland
noted
it
with
exultation
but
even
without
it
he
would
have
broken
into
an
eager
protest
are
you
serious
roderick
he
demanded
serious
of
course
not
how
can
a
man
with
a
crack
in
his
brain
be
serious
how
can
a
muddlehead
reason
but
i
m
not
jesting
either
i
can
no
more
make
jokes
than
utter
oracles
are
you
willing
to
go
home
willing
god
forbid
i
am
simply
amenable
to
force
if
my
mother
chooses
to
take
me
i
won
t
resist
i
can
t
i
have
come
to
that
let
me
resist
then
said
rowland
go
home
as
you
are
now
i
can
t
stand
by
and
see
it
may
have
been
true
that
roderick
had
lost
his
sense
of
humor
but
he
scratched
his
head
with
a
gesture
that
was
almost
comical
in
its
effect
you
are
a
queer
fellow
i
should
think
i
would
disgust
you
stay
another
year
rowland
simply
said
doing
nothing
you
shall
do
something
i
am
responsible
for
your
doing
to
whom
are
you
responsible
rowland
before
replying
glanced
at
miss
garland
and
his
glance
made
her
speak
quickly
not
to
me
i
m
responsible
to
myself
rowland
declared
my
poor
dear
fellow
said
roderick
oh
mallet
are
n
t
you
satisfied
cried
hudson
in
the
tone
in
which
niobe
may
have
addressed
the
avenging
archers
after
she
had
seen
her
fall
it
s
out
of
all
nature
keeping
him
here
when
we
re
in
a
poor
way
surely
our
own
dear
native
land
is
the
place
for
us
do
leave
us
to
ourselves
sir
this
just
failed
of
being
a
dismissal
in
form
and
rowland
bowed
his
head
to
it
roderick
was
silent
for
some
moments
then
suddenly
he
covered
his
face
with
his
two
hands
take
me
at
least
out
of
this
terrible
italy
he
cried
where
everything
mocks
and
reproaches
and
torments
and
eludes
me
take
me
out
of
this
land
of
impossible
beauty
and
put
me
in
the
midst
of
ugliness
set
me
down
where
nature
is
coarse
and
flat
and
men
and
manners
are
vulgar
there
must
be
something
awfully
ugly
in
germany
pack
me
off
there
rowland
answered
that
if
he
wished
to
leave
italy
the
thing
might
be
arranged
he
would
think
it
over
and
submit
a
proposal
on
the
morrow
he
suggested
to
hudson
in
consequence
that
she
should
spend
the
autumn
in
switzerland
where
she
would
find
a
fine
tonic
climate
plenty
of
fresh
milk
and
several
pensions
at
three
francs
and
a
half
a
day
switzerland
of
course
was
not
ugly
but
one
could
not
have
everything
hudson
neither
thanked
him
nor
assented
but
she
wept
and
packed
her
trunks
rowland
had
a
theory
after
the
scene
which
led
to
these
preparations
that
mary
garland
was
weary
of
waiting
for
roderick
to
come
to
his
senses
that
the
faith
which
had
bravely
borne
his
manhood
company
hitherto
on
the
tortuous
march
he
was
leading
it
had
begun
to
believe
it
had
gone
far
enough
this
theory
was
not
vitiated
by
something
she
said
to
him
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
hudson
had
arranged
to
leave
florence
cousin
sarah
the
other
evening
she
said
asked
you
to
please
leave
us
i
think
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
saying
and
i
hope
you
have
not
taken
by
no
means
but
i
honestly
believe
that
my
leaving
you
would
contribute
greatly
to
hudson
s
comfort
i
can
be
your
hidden
providence
you
know
i
can
watch
you
at
a
distance
and
come
upon
the
scene
at
critical
miss
garland
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
ground
and
then
with
sudden
earnestness
i
beg
you
to
come
with
us
she
said
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
after
this
rowland
went
with
them
chapter
xii
the
princess
casamassima
rowland
had
a
very
friendly
memory
of
a
little
mountain
inn
accessible
with
moderate
trouble
from
lucerne
where
he
had
once
spent
a
blissful
ten
days
he
had
at
that
time
been
trudging
knapsack
on
back
over
half
switzerland
and
not
being
on
his
legs
a
particularly
light
weight
it
was
no
shame
to
him
to
confess
that
he
was
mortally
tired
the
inn
of
which
i
speak
presented
striking
analogies
with
a
but
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
it
was
crowded
with
hungry
tourists
it
stood
in
a
high
shallow
valley
with
alpine
meadows
sloping
down
to
it
from
the
base
of
certain
rugged
rocks
whose
outlines
were
grotesque
against
the
evening
sky
rowland
had
seen
grander
places
in
switzerland
that
pleased
him
less
and
whenever
afterwards
he
wished
to
think
of
alpine
opportunities
at
their
best
he
recalled
this
grassy
concave
among
the
and
the
august
days
he
spent
there
resting
deliciously
at
his
length
in
the
lee
of
a
boulder
with
the
light
cool
air
stirring
about
his
temples
the
wafted
odors
of
the
pines
in
his
nostrils
the
tinkle
of
the
in
his
ears
the
vast
progression
of
the
mountain
shadows
before
his
eyes
and
a
volume
of
wordsworth
in
his
pocket
his
face
on
the
swiss
had
been
scorched
to
within
a
shade
of
the
color
nowadays
called
magenta
and
his
bed
was
a
pallet
in
a
loft
which
he
shared
with
a
german
botanist
of
colossal
stature
every
inch
of
him
quaking
at
an
open
window
these
had
been
drawbacks
to
felicity
but
rowland
hardly
cared
where
or
how
he
was
lodged
for
he
spent
the
livelong
day
under
the
sky
on
the
crest
of
a
slope
that
looked
at
the
jungfrau
he
remembered
all
this
on
leaving
florence
with
his
friends
and
he
reflected
that
as
the
midseason
was
over
accommodations
would
be
more
ample
and
charges
more
modest
he
communicated
with
his
old
friend
the
landlord
and
while
september
was
yet
young
his
companions
established
themselves
under
his
guidance
in
the
grassy
valley
he
had
crossed
the
saint
gothard
pass
with
them
in
the
same
carriage
during
the
journey
from
florence
and
especially
during
this
portion
of
it
the
cloud
that
hung
over
the
little
party
had
been
almost
dissipated
and
they
had
looked
at
each
other
in
the
close
contiguity
of
the
train
and
the
without
either
accusing
or
consoling
glances
it
was
impossible
not
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
scenery
of
the
apennines
and
the
italian
alps
and
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
among
the
travelers
to
abstain
from
sombre
allusions
the
effect
of
this
delicate
compact
seemed
excellent
it
ensured
them
a
week
s
intellectual
sunshine
roderick
sat
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
with
a
fascinated
stare
and
with
a
perfect
docility
of
attitude
he
concerned
himself
not
a
particle
about
the
itinerary
or
about
any
of
the
wayside
arrangements
he
took
no
trouble
and
he
gave
none
he
assented
to
everything
that
was
proposed
talked
very
little
and
led
for
a
week
a
perfectly
contemplative
life
his
mother
rarely
removed
her
eyes
from
him
and
if
a
while
before
this
would
have
extremely
irritated
him
he
now
seemed
perfectly
unconscious
of
her
observation
and
profoundly
indifferent
to
anything
that
might
befall
him
they
spent
a
couple
of
days
on
the
lake
of
como
at
a
hotel
with
white
porticoes
smothered
in
oleander
and
myrtle
and
the
leading
down
to
little
boats
with
striped
awnings
they
agreed
it
was
the
earthly
paradise
and
they
passed
the
mornings
strolling
through
the
perfumed
alleys
of
classic
villas
and
the
evenings
floating
in
the
moonlight
in
a
circle
of
outlined
mountains
to
the
music
of
oars
one
day
in
the
afternoon
the
two
young
men
took
a
long
stroll
together
they
followed
the
winding
footway
that
led
toward
como
close
to
the
past
the
gates
of
villas
and
the
walls
of
vineyards
through
little
hamlets
propped
on
a
dozen
arches
and
bathing
their
feet
and
their
pendant
tatters
in
the
ripple
past
frescoed
walls
and
crumbling
campaniles
and
grassy
village
piazzas
and
the
mouth
of
soft
ravines
that
wound
upward
through
belts
of
swinging
vine
and
vaporous
olive
and
splendid
chestnut
to
high
ledges
where
white
chapels
gleamed
amid
the
paler
boskage
and
bare
with
their
lips
drank
in
the
azure
light
it
all
was
confoundingly
picturesque
it
was
the
italy
that
we
know
from
the
steel
engravings
in
old
keepsakes
and
annuals
from
the
vignettes
on
and
the
at
theatres
an
italy
that
we
can
never
confess
to
ourselves
in
spite
of
our
own
changes
and
of
italy
s
that
we
have
ceased
to
believe
in
rowland
and
roderick
turned
aside
from
the
little
paved
footway
that
clambered
and
dipped
and
wound
and
doubled
beside
the
lake
and
stretched
themselves
idly
beneath
a
on
a
grassy
promontory
rowland
had
never
known
anything
so
divinely
soothing
as
the
dreamy
softness
of
that
early
autumn
afternoon
the
iridescent
mountains
shut
him
in
the
little
waves
beneath
him
fretted
the
white
pebbles
at
the
laziest
intervals
the
festooned
vines
above
him
swayed
just
visibly
in
the
all
but
motionless
air
roderick
lay
observing
it
all
with
his
arms
thrown
back
and
his
hands
under
his
head
this
suits
me
he
said
i
could
be
happy
here
and
forget
everything
why
not
stay
here
forever
he
kept
his
position
for
a
long
time
and
seemed
lost
in
his
thoughts
rowland
spoke
to
him
but
he
made
vague
answers
at
last
he
closed
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
rowland
also
a
place
to
stay
in
forever
a
place
for
perfect
oblivion
of
the
disagreeable
suddenly
roderick
turned
over
on
his
face
and
buried
it
in
his
arms
there
had
been
something
passionate
in
his
movement
but
rowland
was
nevertheless
surprised
when
he
at
last
jerked
himself
back
into
a
sitting
posture
to
perceive
the
trace
of
tears
in
his
eyes
roderick
turned
to
his
friend
stretching
his
two
hands
out
toward
the
lake
and
mountains
and
shaking
them
with
an
eloquent
gesture
as
if
his
heart
was
too
full
for
utterance
pity
me
sir
pity
me
he
presently
cried
look
at
this
lovely
world
and
think
what
it
must
be
to
be
dead
to
it
dead
said
rowland
dead
dead
dead
and
buried
buried
in
an
open
grave
where
you
lie
staring
up
at
the
sailing
clouds
smelling
the
waving
flowers
and
hearing
all
nature
live
and
grow
above
you
that
s
the
way
i
feel
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
rowland
death
of
that
sort
is
very
near
to
it
s
too
horrible
roderick
went
on
it
has
all
come
over
me
here
tremendously
if
i
were
not
ashamed
i
could
shed
a
bushel
of
tears
for
one
hour
of
what
i
have
been
i
would
give
up
anything
i
may
be
never
mind
what
you
have
been
be
something
better
i
shall
never
be
anything
again
it
s
no
use
talking
but
i
don
t
know
what
secret
spring
has
been
touched
since
i
have
lain
here
something
in
my
heart
seemed
suddenly
to
open
and
let
in
a
flood
of
beauty
and
desire
i
know
what
i
have
lost
and
i
think
it
horrible
mind
you
i
know
it
i
feel
it
remember
that
hereafter
don
t
say
that
he
was
stupefied
and
senseless
that
his
perception
was
dulled
and
his
aspiration
dead
say
that
he
trembled
in
every
nerve
with
a
sense
of
the
beauty
and
sweetness
of
life
that
he
rebelled
and
protested
and
shrieked
that
he
was
buried
alive
with
his
eyes
open
and
his
heart
beating
to
madness
that
he
clung
to
every
blade
of
grass
and
every
thorn
as
he
passed
that
it
was
the
most
horrible
spectacle
you
ever
witnessed
that
it
was
an
outrage
a
murder
a
massacre
good
heavens
man
are
you
insane
rowland
cried
i
never
have
been
saner
i
don
t
want
to
be
bad
company
and
in
this
beautiful
spot
at
this
delightful
hour
it
seems
an
outrage
to
break
the
charm
but
i
am
bidding
farewell
to
italy
to
beauty
to
honor
to
life
i
only
want
to
assure
you
that
i
know
what
i
lose
i
know
it
in
every
pulse
of
my
heart
here
where
these
things
are
all
loveliest
i
take
leave
of
them
farewell
farewell
during
their
passage
of
the
saint
gothard
roderick
absented
himself
much
of
the
time
from
the
carriage
and
rambled
far
in
advance
along
the
huge
zigzags
of
the
road
he
displayed
an
extraordinary
activity
his
light
weight
and
slender
figure
made
him
an
excellent
pedestrian
and
his
friends
frequently
saw
him
skirting
the
edge
of
plunging
chasms
loosening
the
stones
on
long
steep
slopes
or
lifting
himself
against
the
sky
from
the
top
of
rocky
pinnacles
mary
garland
walked
a
great
deal
but
she
remained
near
the
carriage
to
be
with
hudson
rowland
remained
near
it
to
be
with
miss
garland
he
trudged
by
her
side
up
that
magnificent
ascent
from
italy
and
found
himself
regretting
that
the
alps
were
so
low
and
that
their
trudging
was
not
to
last
a
week
she
was
exhilarated
she
liked
to
walk
in
the
way
of
mountains
until
within
the
last
few
weeks
she
had
seen
nothing
greater
than
mount
holyoke
and
she
found
that
the
alps
amply
justified
their
reputation
rowland
knew
that
she
loved
nature
but
he
was
struck
afresh
with
the
vivacity
of
her
observation
of
it
and
with
her
knowledge
of
plants
and
stones
at
that
season
the
wild
flowers
had
mostly
departed
but
a
few
of
them
lingered
and
miss
garland
never
failed
to
espy
them
in
their
outlying
corners
they
interested
her
greatly
she
was
charmed
when
they
were
old
friends
and
charmed
even
more
when
they
were
new
she
displayed
a
very
light
foot
in
going
in
quest
of
them
and
had
soon
covered
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
with
a
tangle
of
strange
vegetation
rowland
of
course
was
alert
in
her
service
and
he
gathered
for
her
several
botanical
specimens
which
at
first
seemed
inaccessible
one
of
these
indeed
had
at
first
appeared
easier
of
capture
than
his
attempt
attested
and
he
had
paused
a
moment
at
the
base
of
the
little
peak
on
which
it
grew
measuring
the
risk
of
farther
pursuit
suddenly
as
he
stood
there
he
remembered
roderick
s
defiance
of
danger
and
of
miss
light
at
the
coliseum
and
he
was
seized
with
a
strong
desire
to
test
the
courage
of
his
companion
she
had
just
scrambled
up
a
grassy
slope
near
him
and
had
seen
that
the
flower
was
out
of
reach
as
he
prepared
to
approach
it
she
called
to
him
eagerly
to
stop
the
thing
was
impossible
poor
rowland
whose
passion
had
been
terribly
starved
enjoyed
immensely
the
thought
of
having
her
care
for
three
minutes
what
became
of
him
he
was
the
least
brutal
of
men
but
for
a
moment
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
her
suffering
i
can
get
the
flower
he
called
to
her
will
you
trust
me
i
don
t
want
it
i
would
rather
not
have
it
she
cried
will
you
trust
me
he
repeated
looking
at
her
she
looked
at
him
and
then
at
the
flower
he
wondered
whether
she
would
shriek
and
swoon
as
miss
light
had
done
i
wish
it
were
something
better
she
said
simply
and
then
stood
watching
him
while
he
began
to
clamber
rowland
was
not
shaped
for
an
acrobat
and
his
enterprise
was
difficult
but
he
kept
his
wits
about
him
made
the
most
of
narrow
and
coigns
of
vantage
and
at
last
secured
his
prize
he
managed
to
stick
it
into
his
buttonhole
and
then
he
contrived
to
descend
there
was
more
than
one
chance
for
an
ugly
fall
but
he
evaded
them
all
it
was
doubtless
not
gracefully
done
but
it
was
done
and
that
was
all
he
had
proposed
to
himself
he
was
red
in
the
face
when
he
offered
miss
garland
the
flower
and
she
was
visibly
pale
she
had
watched
him
without
moving
all
this
had
passed
without
the
knowledge
of
hudson
who
was
dozing
beneath
the
hood
of
the
carriage
mary
garland
s
eyes
did
not
perhaps
display
that
ardent
admiration
which
was
formerly
conferred
by
the
queen
of
beauty
at
a
tournament
but
they
expressed
something
in
which
rowland
found
his
reward
why
did
you
do
that
she
asked
gravely
he
hesitated
he
felt
that
it
was
physically
possible
to
say
because
i
love
you
but
that
it
was
not
morally
possible
he
lowered
his
pitch
and
answered
simply
because
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
suppose
you
had
fallen
said
miss
garland
i
believed
i
would
not
fall
and
you
believed
it
i
i
believed
nothing
i
simply
trusted
you
as
you
asked
quod
erat
demonstrandum
cried
rowland
i
think
you
know
when
our
four
friends
were
established
in
what
i
have
called
their
grassy
valley
there
was
a
good
deal
of
scrambling
over
slopes
both
grassy
and
stony
a
good
deal
of
on
narrow
ledges
a
great
many
long
walks
and
thanks
to
the
lucid
mountain
air
not
a
little
exhilaration
hudson
was
obliged
to
intermit
her
suspicions
of
the
deleterious
atmosphere
of
the
old
world
and
to
acknowledge
the
edifying
purity
of
the
breezes
of
engelthal
she
was
certainly
more
placid
than
she
had
been
in
italy
having
always
lived
in
the
country
she
had
missed
in
rome
and
florence
that
social
solitude
mitigated
by
bushes
and
rocks
which
is
so
dear
to
the
true
new
england
temperament
the
little
unpainted
inn
at
engelthal
with
its
plank
partitions
its
standing
in
the
sun
its
help
in
the
form
of
angular
young
women
of
the
reminded
her
of
places
of
summer
sojourn
in
her
native
land
and
the
beautiful
historic
chambers
of
the
villa
pandolfini
passed
from
her
memory
without
a
regret
and
without
having
in
the
least
modified
her
ideal
of
domiciliary
grace
roderick
had
changed
his
sky
but
he
had
not
changed
his
mind
his
humor
was
still
that
of
which
he
had
given
rowland
a
glimpse
in
that
tragic
explosion
on
the
lake
of
como
he
kept
his
despair
to
himself
and
he
went
doggedly
about
the
ordinary
business
of
life
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
spirit
was
mortally
heavy
and
that
he
lived
and
moved
and
talked
simply
from
the
force
of
habit
in
that
sad
among
the
italian
olives
there
had
been
such
a
fierce
sincerity
in
his
tone
that
rowland
began
to
abdicate
the
critical
attitude
he
began
to
feel
that
it
was
essentially
vain
to
appeal
to
the
poor
fellow
s
will
there
was
no
will
left
its
place
was
an
impotent
void
this
view
of
the
case
indeed
was
occasionally
contravened
by
certain
indications
on
roderick
s
part
of
the
power
of
resistance
to
disagreeable
obligations
one
might
still
have
said
if
one
had
been
disposed
to
be
didactic
at
any
hazard
that
there
was
a
method
in
his
madness
that
his
moral
energy
had
its
sleeping
and
its
waking
hours
and
that
in
a
cause
that
pleased
it
it
was
capable
of
rising
with
the
dawn
but
on
the
other
hand
pleasure
in
this
case
was
quite
at
one
with
effort
evidently
the
greatest
bliss
in
life
for
roderick
would
have
been
to
have
a
plastic
idea
and
then
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
tenderly
to
a
despair
which
had
so
ceased
to
be
aggressive
not
to
forgive
a
great
deal
of
apathy
to
a
temper
which
had
so
unlearned
its
irritability
roderick
said
frankly
that
switzerland
made
him
less
miserable
than
italy
and
the
alps
seemed
less
to
mock
at
his
enforced
leisure
than
the
apennines
he
indulged
in
long
rambles
generally
alone
and
was
very
fond
of
climbing
into
dizzy
places
where
no
sound
could
overtake
him
and
there
flinging
himself
on
the
moss
of
pulling
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
lounging
away
the
hours
in
perfect
immobility
rowland
sometimes
walked
with
him
though
roderick
never
invited
him
he
seemed
duly
grateful
for
his
society
rowland
now
made
it
a
rule
to
treat
him
like
a
perfectly
sane
man
to
assume
that
all
things
were
well
with
him
and
never
to
allude
to
the
prosperity
he
had
forfeited
or
to
the
work
he
was
not
doing
he
would
have
still
said
had
you
questioned
him
that
roderick
s
condition
was
a
mood
certainly
a
puzzling
one
it
might
last
yet
for
many
a
weary
hour
but
it
was
a
long
lane
that
had
no
turning
roderick
s
blues
would
not
last
forever
rowland
s
interest
in
miss
garland
s
relations
with
her
cousin
was
still
profoundly
attentive
and
perplexed
as
he
was
on
all
sides
he
found
nothing
transparent
here
after
their
arrival
at
engelthal
roderick
appeared
to
seek
the
young
girl
s
society
more
than
he
had
done
hitherto
and
this
revival
of
ardor
could
not
fail
to
set
his
friend
they
sat
together
and
strolled
together
and
miss
garland
often
read
aloud
to
him
one
day
on
their
coming
to
dinner
after
he
had
been
lying
half
the
morning
at
her
feet
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
rowland
asked
him
what
she
had
been
reading
i
don
t
know
roderick
said
i
don
t
heed
the
miss
garland
heard
this
and
rowland
looked
at
her
she
looked
at
roderick
sharply
and
with
a
little
blush
i
listen
to
mary
roderick
continued
for
the
sake
of
her
voice
it
s
distractingly
sweet
at
this
miss
garland
s
blush
deepened
and
she
looked
away
rowland
in
florence
as
we
know
had
suffered
his
imagination
to
wander
in
the
direction
of
certain
conjectures
which
the
reader
may
deem
unflattering
to
miss
garland
s
constancy
he
had
asked
himself
whether
her
faith
in
roderick
had
not
faltered
and
that
demand
of
hers
which
had
brought
about
his
own
departure
for
switzerland
had
seemed
almost
equivalent
to
a
confession
that
she
needed
his
help
to
believe
rowland
was
essentially
a
modest
man
and
he
did
not
risk
the
supposition
that
miss
garland
had
contrasted
him
with
roderick
to
his
own
advantage
but
he
had
a
certain
consciousness
of
duty
resolutely
done
which
allowed
itself
to
fancy
at
moments
that
it
might
be
not
illogically
rewarded
by
the
bestowal
of
such
stray
grains
of
enthusiasm
as
had
crumbled
away
from
her
estimate
of
his
companion
if
some
day
she
had
declared
in
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
that
she
was
outwearied
and
sickened
and
that
she
gave
up
her
recreant
lover
rowland
s
expectation
would
have
gone
to
meet
her
and
certainly
if
her
passion
had
taken
this
course
no
generous
critic
would
utterly
condemn
her
she
had
been
neglected
ignored
forsaken
treated
with
a
contempt
which
no
girl
of
a
fine
temper
could
endure
there
were
girls
indeed
whose
fineness
like
that
of
burd
helen
in
the
ballad
lay
in
clinging
to
the
man
of
their
love
through
thick
and
thin
and
in
bowing
their
head
to
all
hard
usage
this
attitude
had
often
an
exquisite
beauty
of
its
own
but
rowland
deemed
that
he
had
solid
reason
to
believe
it
never
could
be
mary
garland
s
she
was
not
a
passive
creature
she
was
not
soft
and
meek
and
grateful
for
chance
bounties
with
all
her
reserve
of
manner
she
was
proud
and
eager
she
asked
much
and
she
wanted
what
she
asked
she
believed
in
fine
things
and
she
never
could
long
persuade
herself
that
fine
things
missed
were
as
beautiful
as
fine
things
achieved
once
rowland
passed
an
angry
day
he
had
dreamed
it
was
the
most
insubstantial
of
dreams
that
she
had
given
him
the
right
to
believe
that
she
looked
to
him
to
transmute
her
discontent
and
yet
here
she
was
throwing
herself
back
into
roderick
s
arms
at
his
lightest
overture
and
playing
with
his
own
half
fearful
half
shameful
hopes
rowland
declared
to
himself
that
his
position
was
essentially
detestable
and
that
all
the
philosophy
he
could
bring
to
bear
upon
it
would
make
it
neither
honorable
nor
comfortable
he
would
go
away
and
make
an
end
of
it
he
did
not
go
away
he
simply
took
a
long
walk
stayed
away
from
the
inn
all
day
and
on
his
return
found
miss
garland
sitting
out
in
the
moonlight
with
roderick
rowland
communing
with
himself
during
the
restless
ramble
in
question
had
determined
that
he
would
at
least
cease
to
observe
to
heed
or
to
care
for
what
miss
garland
and
roderick
might
do
or
might
not
do
together
nevertheless
some
three
days
afterward
the
opportunity
presenting
itself
he
deliberately
broached
the
subject
with
roderick
he
knew
this
was
inconsistent
and
it
was
indulgence
to
the
fingers
that
itched
to
handle
forbidden
fruit
but
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
really
more
logical
to
be
inconsistent
than
the
reverse
for
they
had
formerly
discussed
these
mysteries
very
candidly
was
it
not
perfectly
reasonable
that
he
should
wish
to
know
the
sequel
of
the
situation
which
roderick
had
then
delineated
roderick
had
made
him
promises
and
it
was
to
be
expected
that
he
should
ascertain
how
the
promises
had
been
kept
rowland
could
not
say
to
himself
that
if
the
promises
had
been
extorted
for
mary
garland
s
sake
his
present
attention
to
them
was
equally
disinterested
and
so
he
had
to
admit
that
he
was
indeed
he
may
perhaps
be
deemed
too
narrow
a
casuist
but
we
have
repeated
more
than
once
that
he
was
solidly
burdened
with
a
conscience
i
imagine
he
said
to
roderick
that
you
are
not
sorry
at
present
to
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
dissuaded
from
making
a
final
rupture
with
miss
roderick
eyed
him
with
the
vague
and
absent
look
which
had
lately
become
habitual
to
his
face
and
repeated
dissuaded
don
t
you
remember
that
in
rome
you
wished
to
break
your
engagement
and
that
i
urged
you
to
respect
it
though
it
seemed
to
hang
by
so
slender
a
thread
i
wished
you
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
are
reconciled
to
oh
yes
said
roderick
i
remember
what
you
said
you
made
it
a
kind
of
personal
favor
to
yourself
that
i
should
remain
faithful
i
consented
but
afterwards
when
i
thought
of
it
your
attitude
greatly
amused
me
had
it
ever
been
seen
before
a
man
asking
another
man
to
gratify
him
by
not
suspending
his
attentions
to
a
pretty
girl
it
was
as
selfish
as
anything
else
said
rowland
one
man
puts
his
selfishness
into
one
thing
and
one
into
another
it
would
have
utterly
marred
my
comfort
to
see
miss
garland
in
low
but
you
liked
her
you
admired
her
eh
so
you
i
admire
her
it
was
your
originality
then
to
do
you
justice
you
have
a
great
deal
of
a
certain
sort
to
wish
her
happiness
secured
in
just
that
fashion
many
a
man
would
have
liked
better
himself
to
make
the
woman
he
admired
happy
and
would
have
welcomed
her
low
spirits
as
an
opening
for
sympathy
you
were
awfully
queer
about
so
be
it
said
rowland
the
question
is
are
you
not
glad
i
was
queer
are
you
not
finding
that
your
affection
for
miss
garland
has
a
permanent
quality
which
you
rather
underestimated
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
when
she
arrived
in
rome
i
found
i
did
n
t
care
for
her
and
i
honestly
proposed
that
we
should
have
no
humbug
about
it
if
you
on
the
contrary
thought
there
was
something
to
be
gained
by
having
a
little
humbug
i
was
willing
to
try
it
i
don
t
see
that
the
situation
is
really
changed
mary
garland
is
all
that
she
ever
was
more
than
all
but
i
don
t
care
for
her
i
don
t
care
for
anything
and
i
don
t
find
myself
inspired
to
make
an
exception
in
her
favor
the
only
difference
is
that
i
don
t
care
now
whether
i
care
for
her
or
not
of
course
marrying
such
a
useless
lout
as
i
am
is
out
of
the
question
for
any
woman
and
i
should
pay
miss
garland
a
poor
compliment
to
assume
that
she
is
in
a
hurry
to
celebrate
our
oh
you
re
in
love
said
rowland
not
very
logically
it
must
be
confessed
at
any
cost
that
this
assertion
was
made
for
the
sole
purpose
of
hearing
roderick
deny
it
but
it
quite
failed
of
its
aim
roderick
gave
a
liberal
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
an
irresponsible
toss
of
his
head
call
it
what
you
please
i
am
past
caring
for
rowland
had
not
only
been
illogical
he
had
also
been
slightly
disingenuous
he
did
not
believe
that
his
companion
was
in
love
he
had
argued
the
false
to
learn
the
true
the
true
was
that
roderick
was
again
in
some
degree
under
a
charm
and
that
he
found
a
healing
virtue
in
mary
s
presence
indisposed
though
he
was
to
admit
it
he
had
said
shortly
before
that
her
voice
was
sweet
to
his
ear
and
this
was
a
promising
beginning
if
her
voice
was
sweet
it
was
probable
that
her
glance
was
not
amiss
that
her
touch
had
a
quiet
magic
and
that
her
whole
personal
presence
had
learned
the
art
of
not
being
irritating
so
rowland
reasoned
and
invested
mary
garland
with
a
still
finer
loveliness
it
was
true
that
she
herself
helped
him
little
to
definite
conclusions
and
that
he
remained
in
puzzled
doubt
as
to
whether
these
happy
touches
were
still
a
matter
of
the
heart
or
had
become
simply
a
matter
of
the
conscience
he
watched
for
signs
that
she
rejoiced
in
roderick
s
renewed
acceptance
of
her
society
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
on
her
guard
against
interpreting
it
too
largely
it
was
now
her
turn
he
fancied
that
he
sometimes
gathered
from
certain
nameless
indications
of
glance
and
tone
and
gesture
it
was
now
her
turn
to
be
indifferent
to
care
for
other
things
again
and
again
rowland
asked
himself
what
these
things
were
that
miss
garland
might
be
supposed
to
care
for
to
the
injury
of
ideal
constancy
and
again
having
designated
them
he
divided
them
into
two
portions
one
was
that
larger
experience
in
general
which
had
come
to
her
with
her
arrival
in
europe
the
vague
sense
borne
in
upon
her
imagination
that
there
were
more
things
one
might
do
with
one
s
life
than
youth
and
ignorance
and
northampton
had
dreamt
of
the
revision
of
old
pledges
in
the
light
of
new
emotions
the
other
was
the
experience
in
especial
of
rowland
s
what
here
rowland
always
paused
in
perfect
sincerity
to
measure
afresh
his
possible
claim
to
the
young
girl
s
regard
what
might
he
call
it
it
had
been
more
than
civility
and
yet
it
had
been
less
than
devotion
it
had
spoken
of
a
desire
to
serve
but
it
had
said
nothing
of
a
hope
of
reward
nevertheless
rowland
s
fancy
hovered
about
the
idea
that
it
was
recompensable
and
his
reflections
ended
in
a
reverie
which
perhaps
did
not
define
it
but
at
least
on
each
occasion
added
a
little
to
its
volume
since
miss
garland
had
asked
him
as
a
sort
of
favor
to
herself
to
come
also
to
switzerland
he
thought
it
possible
she
might
let
him
know
whether
he
seemed
to
have
effectively
served
her
the
days
passed
without
her
doing
so
and
at
last
rowland
walked
away
to
an
isolated
eminence
some
five
miles
from
the
inn
and
murmured
to
the
silent
rocks
that
she
was
ungrateful
listening
nature
seemed
not
to
contradict
him
so
that
on
the
morrow
he
asked
the
young
girl
with
an
infinitesimal
touch
of
irony
whether
it
struck
her
that
his
deflection
from
his
florentine
plan
had
been
attended
with
brilliant
results
why
we
are
delighted
that
you
are
with
us
she
answered
he
was
anything
but
satisfied
with
this
it
seemed
to
imply
that
she
had
forgotten
that
she
had
solemnly
asked
him
to
come
he
reminded
her
of
her
request
and
recalled
the
place
and
time
that
evening
on
the
terrace
late
after
hudson
had
gone
to
bed
and
roderick
being
she
perfectly
remembered
but
the
memory
seemed
to
trouble
her
i
am
afraid
your
kindness
has
been
a
great
charge
upon
you
she
said
you
wanted
very
much
to
do
something
i
wanted
above
all
things
to
oblige
you
and
i
made
no
sacrifice
but
if
i
had
made
an
immense
one
it
would
be
more
than
made
up
to
me
by
any
assurance
that
i
have
helped
roderick
into
a
better
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
why
do
you
ask
me
she
said
you
are
able
to
judge
quite
as
well
as
rowland
blushed
he
desired
to
justify
himself
in
the
most
veracious
manner
the
truth
is
he
said
that
i
am
afraid
i
care
only
in
the
second
place
for
roderick
s
holding
up
his
head
what
i
care
for
in
the
first
place
is
your
i
don
t
know
why
that
should
be
she
answered
i
have
certainly
done
nothing
to
make
you
so
much
my
friend
if
you
were
to
tell
me
you
intended
to
leave
us
i
am
afraid
that
i
should
not
venture
to
ask
you
to
stay
but
whether
you
go
or
stay
let
us
not
talk
of
roderick
but
that
said
rowland
does
n
t
answer
my
question
is
he
better
no
she
said
and
turned
away
he
was
careful
not
to
tell
her
that
he
intended
to
leave
them
one
day
shortly
after
this
as
the
two
young
men
sat
at
the
watching
the
sunset
which
on
that
evening
was
very
striking
and
lurid
rowland
made
an
attempt
to
sound
his
companion
s
present
sentiment
touching
christina
light
i
wonder
where
she
is
he
said
and
what
sort
of
a
life
she
is
leading
her
roderick
at
first
made
no
response
he
was
watching
a
figure
on
the
summit
of
some
distant
rocks
opposite
to
them
the
figure
was
apparently
descending
into
the
valley
and
in
relief
against
the
crimson
screen
of
the
western
sky
it
looked
gigantic
christina
light
roderick
at
last
repeated
as
if
arousing
himself
from
a
reverie
where
she
is
it
s
extraordinary
how
little
i
care
have
you
then
completely
got
over
it
to
this
roderick
made
no
direct
reply
he
sat
brooding
a
while
she
s
a
humbug
he
presently
exclaimed
possibly
said
rowland
but
i
have
known
worse
she
disappointed
me
roderick
continued
in
the
same
tone
had
she
then
really
given
you
hopes
oh
don
t
recall
it
roderick
cried
why
the
devil
should
i
think
of
it
it
was
only
three
months
ago
but
it
seems
like
ten
his
friend
said
nothing
more
and
after
a
while
he
went
on
of
his
own
accord
i
believed
there
was
a
future
in
it
all
she
pleased
me
pleased
me
and
when
an
artist
such
as
i
was
is
pleased
you
know
and
he
paused
again
you
never
saw
her
as
i
did
you
never
heard
her
in
her
great
moments
but
there
is
no
use
talking
about
that
at
first
she
would
n
t
regard
me
seriously
she
chaffed
me
and
made
light
of
me
but
at
last
i
forced
her
to
admit
i
was
a
great
man
think
of
that
sir
christina
light
called
me
a
great
man
a
great
man
was
what
she
was
looking
for
and
we
agreed
to
find
our
happiness
for
life
in
each
other
to
please
me
she
promised
not
to
marry
till
i
gave
her
leave
i
was
not
in
a
marrying
way
myself
but
it
was
damnation
to
think
of
another
man
possessing
her
to
spare
my
sensibilities
she
promised
to
turn
off
her
prince
and
the
idea
of
her
doing
so
made
me
as
happy
as
to
see
a
perfect
statue
shaping
itself
in
the
block
you
have
seen
how
she
kept
her
promise
when
i
learned
it
it
was
as
if
the
statue
had
suddenly
cracked
and
turned
hideous
she
died
for
me
like
that
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
was
it
wounded
vanity
disappointed
desire
betrayed
confidence
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
you
certainly
have
some
name
for
the
poor
girl
did
the
best
she
could
said
rowland
if
that
was
her
best
so
much
the
worse
for
her
i
have
hardly
thought
of
her
these
two
months
but
i
have
not
forgiven
well
you
may
believe
that
you
are
avenged
i
can
t
think
of
her
as
i
don
t
pity
her
said
roderick
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
the
two
sat
watching
the
colossal
figure
as
it
made
its
way
downward
along
the
jagged
silhouette
of
the
rocks
who
is
this
mighty
man
cried
roderick
at
last
and
what
is
he
coming
down
upon
us
for
we
are
small
people
here
and
we
can
t
undertake
to
keep
company
with
wait
till
we
meet
him
on
our
own
level
said
rowland
and
perhaps
he
will
not
overtop
for
ten
minutes
at
least
roderick
rejoined
he
will
have
been
a
great
man
at
this
moment
the
figure
sank
beneath
the
horizon
line
and
became
invisible
in
the
uncertain
light
suddenly
roderick
said
i
would
like
to
see
her
once
more
simply
to
look
at
i
would
not
advise
it
said
rowland
it
was
her
beauty
that
did
it
roderick
went
on
it
was
all
her
beauty
in
comparison
the
rest
was
nothing
what
befooled
me
was
to
think
of
it
as
my
property
and
i
had
made
it
mine
no
one
else
had
studied
it
as
i
had
no
one
else
understood
it
what
does
that
stick
of
a
casamassima
know
about
it
at
this
hour
i
should
like
to
see
it
just
once
more
it
s
the
only
thing
in
the
world
of
which
i
can
say
i
would
not
advise
it
rowland
repeated
that
s
right
dear
rowland
said
roderick
don
t
advise
that
s
no
use
the
dusk
meanwhile
had
thickened
and
they
had
not
perceived
a
figure
approaching
them
across
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
house
suddenly
it
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
projected
from
the
door
and
windows
and
they
beheld
little
sam
singleton
stopping
to
stare
at
them
he
was
the
giant
whom
they
had
seen
descending
along
the
rocks
when
this
was
made
apparent
roderick
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
intense
hilarity
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
laughed
in
three
months
singleton
who
carried
a
knapsack
and
received
from
rowland
the
friendliest
welcome
he
was
in
the
serenest
possible
humor
and
if
in
the
way
of
luggage
his
knapsack
contained
nothing
but
a
comb
and
a
second
shirt
he
produced
from
it
a
dozen
admirable
sketches
he
had
been
trudging
over
half
switzerland
and
making
everywhere
the
most
vivid
pictorial
notes
they
were
mostly
in
a
box
at
interlaken
and
in
gratitude
for
rowland
s
appreciation
he
presently
telegraphed
for
his
box
which
according
to
the
excellent
swiss
method
was
punctually
delivered
by
post
the
nights
were
cold
and
our
friends
with
three
or
four
other
chance
sojourners
sat
over
a
fire
of
logs
even
with
roderick
sitting
moodily
in
the
outer
shadow
they
made
a
sympathetic
little
circle
and
they
turned
over
singleton
s
drawings
while
he
perched
in
the
blushing
and
grinning
with
his
feet
on
the
rounds
of
his
chair
he
had
been
pedestrianizing
for
six
weeks
and
he
was
glad
to
rest
awhile
at
engelthal
it
was
an
economic
repose
however
for
he
sallied
forth
every
morning
with
his
sketching
tools
on
his
back
in
search
of
material
for
new
studies
roderick
s
hilarity
after
the
first
evening
had
subsided
and
he
watched
the
little
painter
s
serene
activity
with
a
gravity
that
was
almost
portentous
singleton
who
was
not
in
the
secret
of
his
personal
misfortunes
still
treated
him
with
timid
frankness
as
the
rising
star
of
american
art
roderick
had
said
to
rowland
at
first
that
singleton
reminded
him
of
some
curious
little
insect
with
a
remarkable
mechanical
instinct
in
its
antennae
but
as
the
days
went
by
it
was
apparent
that
the
modest
landscapist
s
unflagging
industry
grew
to
have
an
oppressive
meaning
for
him
it
pointed
a
moral
and
roderick
used
to
sit
and
con
the
moral
as
he
saw
it
figured
in
singleton
s
bent
back
on
the
hot
protruding
from
beneath
his
white
umbrella
one
day
he
wandered
up
a
long
slope
and
overtook
him
as
he
sat
at
work
singleton
related
the
incident
afterwards
to
rowland
who
after
giving
him
in
rome
a
hint
of
roderick
s
aberrations
had
strictly
kept
his
own
counsel
are
you
always
like
this
said
roderick
in
almost
sepulchral
accents
like
this
repeated
singleton
blinking
confusedly
with
an
alarmed
conscience
you
remind
me
of
a
watch
that
never
runs
down
if
one
listens
hard
one
hears
you
always
oh
i
see
said
singleton
beaming
ingenuously
i
am
very
you
are
very
equable
yes
and
do
you
find
it
pleasant
to
be
equable
singleton
turned
and
grinned
more
brightly
while
he
sucked
the
water
from
his
camel
brush
then
with
a
quickened
sense
of
his
indebtedness
to
a
providence
that
had
endowed
him
with
intrinsic
facilities
oh
delightful
he
exclaimed
roderick
stood
looking
at
him
a
moment
damnation
he
said
at
last
solemnly
and
turned
his
back
one
morning
shortly
after
this
rowland
and
roderick
took
a
long
walk
they
had
walked
before
in
a
dozen
different
directions
but
they
had
not
yet
crossed
a
charming
little
wooded
pass
which
shut
in
their
valley
on
one
side
and
descended
into
the
vale
of
engelberg
in
coming
from
lucerne
they
had
approached
their
inn
by
this
path
and
feeling
that
they
knew
it
had
hitherto
neglected
it
in
favor
of
untrodden
ways
but
at
last
the
list
of
these
was
exhausted
and
rowland
proposed
the
walk
to
engelberg
as
a
novelty
the
place
is
half
bleak
and
half
pastoral
a
huge
white
monastery
rises
abruptly
from
the
green
floor
of
the
valley
and
complicates
its
picturesqueness
with
an
element
rare
in
swiss
scenery
hard
by
is
a
group
of
chalets
and
inns
with
the
usual
appurtenances
of
a
prosperous
swiss
resort
lean
brown
guides
in
baggy
homespun
lounging
under
carved
wooden
galleries
stacks
of
alpenstocks
in
every
doorway
englishmen
without
our
two
friends
sat
a
while
at
the
door
of
an
inn
discussing
a
pint
of
wine
and
then
roderick
who
was
indefatigable
announced
his
intention
of
climbing
to
a
certain
rocky
pinnacle
which
overhung
the
valley
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
guides
commanded
a
view
of
the
lake
of
lucerne
to
go
and
come
back
was
only
a
matter
of
an
hour
but
rowland
with
the
prospect
of
his
homeward
trudge
before
him
confessed
to
a
preference
for
lounging
on
his
bench
or
at
most
strolling
a
trifle
farther
and
taking
a
look
at
the
monastery
roderick
went
off
alone
and
his
companion
after
a
while
bent
his
steps
to
the
monasterial
church
it
was
remarkable
like
most
of
the
churches
of
catholic
switzerland
for
a
hideous
style
of
devotional
ornament
but
it
had
a
certain
cold
and
musty
picturesqueness
and
rowland
lingered
there
with
some
tenderness
for
alpine
piety
while
he
was
near
the
some
people
came
in
at
the
west
door
but
he
did
not
notice
them
and
was
presently
engaged
in
deciphering
a
curious
old
german
epitaph
on
one
of
the
mural
tablets
at
last
he
turned
away
wondering
whether
its
syntax
or
its
theology
was
the
more
uncomfortable
and
to
this
infinite
surprise
found
himself
confronted
with
the
prince
and
princess
casamassima
the
surprise
on
christina
s
part
for
an
instant
was
equal
and
at
first
she
seemed
disposed
to
turn
away
without
letting
it
give
place
to
a
greeting
the
prince
however
saluted
gravely
and
then
christina
in
silence
put
out
her
hand
rowland
immediately
asked
whether
they
were
staying
at
engelberg
but
christina
only
looked
at
him
without
speaking
the
prince
answered
his
questions
and
related
that
they
had
been
making
a
month
s
tour
in
switzerland
that
at
lucerne
his
wife
had
been
somewhat
obstinately
indisposed
and
that
the
physician
had
recommended
a
week
s
trial
of
the
tonic
air
and
goat
s
milk
of
engelberg
the
scenery
said
the
prince
was
stupendous
but
the
life
was
terribly
sad
and
they
had
three
days
more
it
was
a
blessing
he
urbanely
added
to
see
a
good
roman
face
christina
s
attitude
her
solemn
silence
and
her
penetrating
gaze
seemed
to
rowland
at
first
to
savor
of
affectation
but
he
presently
perceived
that
she
was
profoundly
agitated
and
that
she
was
afraid
of
betraying
herself
do
let
us
leave
this
hideous
edifice
she
said
there
are
things
here
that
set
one
s
teeth
on
they
moved
slowly
to
the
door
and
when
they
stood
outside
in
the
sunny
coolness
of
the
valley
she
turned
to
rowland
and
said
i
am
extremely
glad
to
see
then
she
glanced
about
her
and
observed
against
the
wall
of
the
church
an
old
stone
seat
she
looked
at
prince
casamassima
a
moment
and
he
smiled
more
intensely
rowland
thought
than
the
occasion
demanded
i
wish
to
sit
here
she
said
and
speak
to
mallet
at
your
pleasure
dear
friend
said
the
prince
the
tone
of
each
was
measured
to
rowland
s
ear
but
that
of
christina
was
dry
and
that
of
her
husband
was
splendidly
urbane
rowland
remembered
that
the
cavaliere
giacosa
had
told
him
that
light
s
candidate
was
thoroughly
a
prince
and
our
friend
wondered
how
he
relished
a
peremptory
accent
casamassima
was
an
italian
of
the
undemonstrative
type
but
rowland
nevertheless
divined
that
like
other
princes
before
him
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
thing
called
compromise
shall
i
come
back
he
asked
with
the
same
smile
in
half
an
hour
said
christina
in
the
clear
outer
light
rowland
s
first
impression
of
her
was
that
she
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
yet
in
three
months
she
could
hardly
have
changed
the
change
was
in
rowland
s
own
vision
of
her
which
that
last
interview
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
had
made
unprecedentedly
tender
how
came
you
here
she
asked
are
you
staying
in
this
place
i
am
staying
at
engelthal
some
ten
miles
away
i
walked
are
you
alone
i
am
with
is
he
here
with
you
he
went
half
an
hour
ago
to
climb
a
rock
for
a
and
his
mother
and
that
young
girl
where
are
they
they
also
are
at
what
do
you
do
there
what
do
you
do
here
said
rowland
smiling
i
count
the
minutes
till
my
week
is
up
i
hate
mountains
they
depress
me
to
death
i
am
sure
miss
garland
likes
she
is
very
fond
of
them
i
you
believe
don
t
you
know
but
i
have
given
up
trying
to
imitate
miss
garland
said
christina
you
surely
need
imitate
no
don
t
say
that
she
said
gravely
so
you
have
walked
ten
miles
this
morning
and
you
are
to
walk
back
again
back
again
to
and
hudson
too
mr
hudson
especially
he
is
a
great
you
men
are
happy
christina
cried
i
believe
i
should
enjoy
the
mountains
if
i
could
do
such
things
it
is
sitting
still
and
having
them
scowl
down
at
you
prince
casamassina
never
rides
he
only
goes
on
a
mule
he
was
carried
up
the
faulhorn
on
a
on
a
litter
said
rowland
in
one
of
those
machines
a
chaise
a
porteurs
like
a
rowland
received
this
information
in
silence
it
was
equally
unbecoming
to
either
relish
or
deprecate
its
irony
is
hudson
to
join
you
again
will
he
come
here
christina
asked
i
shall
soon
begin
to
expect
what
shall
you
do
when
you
leave
switzerland
christina
continued
shall
you
go
back
to
rome
i
rather
doubt
it
my
plans
are
very
they
depend
upon
hudson
eh
in
a
great
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
him
is
he
still
in
that
perverse
state
of
mind
that
afflicted
you
so
much
rowland
looked
at
her
mistrustfully
without
answering
he
was
indisposed
instinctively
to
tell
her
that
roderick
was
unhappy
it
was
possible
she
might
offer
to
help
him
back
to
happiness
she
immediately
perceived
his
hesitation
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
frank
she
said
i
should
think
we
were
excellently
placed
for
that
sort
of
thing
you
remember
that
formerly
i
cared
very
little
what
i
said
don
t
you
well
i
care
absolutely
not
at
all
now
i
say
what
i
please
i
do
what
i
please
how
did
hudson
receive
the
news
of
my
marriage
very
badly
said
rowland
with
rage
and
reproaches
and
as
rowland
hesitated
again
with
silent
contempt
i
can
tell
you
but
little
he
spoke
to
me
on
the
subject
but
i
stopped
him
i
told
him
it
was
none
of
his
business
or
of
that
was
an
excellent
answer
said
christina
softly
yet
it
was
a
little
your
business
after
those
sublime
protestations
i
treated
you
to
i
was
really
very
fine
that
morning
eh
you
do
yourself
injustice
said
rowland
i
should
be
at
liberty
now
to
believe
you
were
what
does
it
matter
now
whether
i
was
insincere
or
not
i
can
t
conceive
of
anything
mattering
less
i
was
very
fine
is
n
t
it
true
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
said
rowland
and
for
fear
of
being
forced
to
betray
his
suspicion
of
the
cause
of
her
change
he
took
refuge
in
a
commonplace
your
mother
i
hope
is
my
mother
is
in
the
enjoyment
of
superb
health
and
may
be
seen
every
evening
at
the
casino
at
the
baths
of
lucca
confiding
to
every
that
she
has
married
her
daughter
to
a
pearl
of
a
rowland
was
anxious
for
news
of
light
s
companion
and
the
natural
course
was
frankly
to
inquire
about
him
and
the
cavaliere
giacosa
is
well
he
asked
christina
hesitated
but
she
betrayed
no
other
embarrassment
the
cavaliere
has
retired
to
his
native
city
of
ancona
upon
a
pension
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
he
is
a
very
good
old
man
i
have
a
great
regard
for
him
said
rowland
gravely
at
the
same
time
that
he
privately
wondered
whether
the
cavaliere
s
pension
was
paid
by
prince
casamassima
for
services
rendered
in
connection
with
his
marriage
had
the
cavaliere
received
his
commission
and
what
do
you
do
rowland
continued
on
leaving
this
place
we
go
to
italy
we
go
to
she
rose
and
stood
silent
a
moment
looking
down
the
valley
the
figure
of
prince
casamassima
appeared
in
the
distance
balancing
his
white
umbrella
as
her
eyes
rested
upon
it
rowland
imagined
that
he
saw
something
deeper
in
the
strange
expression
which
had
lurked
in
her
face
while
he
talked
to
her
at
first
he
had
been
dazzled
by
her
blooming
beauty
to
which
the
lapse
of
weeks
had
only
added
splendor
then
he
had
seen
a
heavier
ray
in
the
light
of
her
eye
a
sinister
intimation
of
sadness
and
bitterness
it
was
the
outward
mark
of
her
sacrificed
ideal
her
eyes
grew
cold
as
she
looked
at
her
husband
and
when
after
a
moment
she
turned
them
upon
rowland
they
struck
him
as
intensely
tragical
he
felt
a
singular
mixture
of
sympathy
and
dread
he
wished
to
give
her
a
proof
of
friendship
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
now
turned
her
face
in
a
direction
where
friendship
was
impotent
to
interpose
she
half
read
his
feelings
apparently
and
she
gave
a
beautiful
sad
smile
i
hope
we
may
never
meet
again
she
said
and
as
rowland
gave
her
a
protesting
look
you
have
seen
me
at
my
best
i
wish
to
tell
you
solemnly
i
was
sincere
i
know
appearances
are
against
me
she
went
on
quickly
there
is
a
great
deal
i
can
t
tell
you
perhaps
you
have
guessed
it
i
care
very
little
you
know
at
any
rate
i
did
my
best
it
would
n
t
serve
i
was
beaten
and
broken
they
were
stronger
than
i
now
it
s
another
affair
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
large
chance
for
happiness
yet
said
rowland
vaguely
happiness
i
mean
to
cultivate
rapture
i
mean
to
go
in
for
bliss
ineffable
you
remember
i
told
you
that
i
was
in
part
the
world
s
and
the
devil
s
now
they
have
taken
me
all
it
was
their
choice
may
they
never
repent
i
shall
hear
of
you
said
rowland
you
will
hear
of
me
and
whatever
you
do
hear
remember
this
i
was
sincere
prince
casamassima
had
approached
and
rowland
looked
at
him
with
a
good
deal
of
simple
compassion
as
a
part
of
that
world
against
which
christina
had
launched
her
mysterious
menace
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
that
he
could
not
in
the
nature
of
things
be
a
positively
bad
husband
but
his
distinguished
inoffensiveness
only
deepened
the
infelicity
of
christina
s
situation
by
depriving
her
defiant
attitude
of
the
sanction
of
relative
justice
so
long
as
she
had
been
free
to
choose
she
had
esteemed
him
but
from
the
moment
she
was
forced
to
marry
him
she
had
detested
him
rowland
read
in
the
young
man
s
elastic
italian
mask
a
profound
consciousness
of
all
this
and
as
he
found
there
also
a
record
of
other
curious
things
of
pride
of
temper
of
bigotry
of
an
immense
heritage
of
more
or
less
aggressive
traditions
he
reflected
that
the
matrimonial
conjunction
of
his
two
companions
might
be
sufficiently
prolific
in
incident
you
are
going
to
naples
rowland
said
to
the
prince
by
way
of
conversation
we
are
going
to
paris
christina
interposed
slowly
and
softly
we
are
going
to
london
we
are
going
to
vienna
we
are
going
to
prince
casamassima
dropped
his
eyes
and
fretted
the
earth
with
the
point
of
his
umbrella
while
he
engaged
rowland
s
attention
christina
turned
away
when
rowland
glanced
at
her
again
he
saw
a
change
pass
over
her
face
she
was
observing
something
that
was
concealed
from
his
own
eyes
by
the
angle
of
the
in
a
moment
roderick
stepped
into
sight
he
stopped
short
astonished
his
face
and
figure
were
jaded
his
garments
dusty
he
looked
at
christina
from
head
to
foot
and
then
slowly
his
cheek
flushed
and
his
eye
expanded
christina
returned
his
gaze
and
for
some
moments
there
was
a
singular
silence
you
don
t
look
well
christina
said
at
last
roderick
answered
nothing
he
only
looked
and
looked
as
if
she
had
been
a
statue
you
are
no
less
beautiful
he
presently
cried
she
turned
away
with
a
smile
and
stood
a
while
gazing
down
the
valley
roderick
stared
at
prince
casamassima
christina
then
put
out
her
hand
to
rowland
farewell
she
said
if
you
are
near
me
in
future
don
t
try
to
see
me
and
then
after
a
pause
in
a
lower
tone
i
was
sincere
she
addressed
herself
again
to
roderick
and
asked
him
some
commonplace
about
his
walk
but
he
said
nothing
he
only
looked
at
her
rowland
at
first
had
expected
an
outbreak
of
reproach
but
it
was
evident
that
the
danger
was
every
moment
diminishing
he
was
forgetting
everything
but
her
beauty
and
as
she
stood
there
and
let
him
feast
upon
it
rowland
was
sure
that
she
knew
it
i
won
t
say
farewell
to
you
she
said
we
shall
meet
again
and
she
moved
gravely
away
prince
casamassima
took
leave
courteously
of
rowland
upon
roderick
he
bestowed
a
bow
of
exaggerated
civility
roderick
appeared
not
to
see
it
he
was
still
watching
christina
as
she
passed
over
the
grass
his
eyes
followed
her
until
she
reached
the
door
of
her
inn
here
she
stopped
and
looked
back
at
him
chapter
xiii
switzerland
on
the
homeward
walk
that
evening
roderick
preserved
a
silence
which
rowland
allowed
to
make
him
uneasy
early
on
the
morrow
roderick
saying
nothing
of
his
intentions
started
off
on
a
walk
rowland
saw
him
striding
with
light
steps
along
the
rugged
path
to
engelberg
he
was
absent
all
day
and
he
gave
no
account
of
himself
on
his
return
he
said
he
was
deadly
tired
and
he
went
to
bed
early
when
he
had
left
the
room
miss
garland
drew
near
to
rowland
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
question
she
said
what
happened
to
roderick
yesterday
at
engelberg
you
have
discovered
that
something
happened
rowland
answered
i
am
sure
of
it
was
it
something
painful
i
don
t
know
how
at
the
present
moment
he
judges
it
he
met
the
princess
thank
you
said
miss
garland
simply
and
turned
away
the
conversation
had
been
brief
but
like
many
small
things
it
furnished
rowland
with
food
for
reflection
when
one
is
looking
for
symptoms
one
easily
finds
them
this
was
the
first
time
mary
garland
had
asked
rowland
a
question
which
it
was
in
roderick
s
power
to
answer
the
first
time
she
had
frankly
betrayed
roderick
s
reticence
rowland
ventured
to
think
it
marked
an
era
the
next
morning
was
sultry
and
the
air
usually
so
fresh
at
those
altitudes
was
oppressively
heavy
rowland
lounged
on
the
grass
a
while
near
singleton
who
was
at
work
under
his
white
umbrella
within
view
of
the
house
and
then
in
quest
of
coolness
he
wandered
away
to
the
rocky
ridge
whence
you
looked
across
at
the
jungfrau
however
the
white
summits
were
invisible
their
heads
were
muffled
in
sullen
clouds
and
the
valleys
beneath
them
curtained
in
mist
rowland
had
a
book
in
his
pocket
and
he
took
it
out
and
opened
it
but
his
page
remained
unturned
his
own
thoughts
were
more
importunate
his
interview
with
christina
light
had
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
and
he
was
haunted
with
the
memory
of
her
almost
blameless
bitterness
and
of
all
that
was
tragic
and
fatal
in
her
latest
transformation
these
things
were
immensely
appealing
and
rowland
thought
with
infinite
impatience
of
roderick
s
having
again
encountered
them
it
required
little
imagination
to
apprehend
that
the
young
sculptor
s
condition
had
also
appealed
to
christina
his
consummate
indifference
his
supreme
defiance
would
make
him
a
magnificent
trophy
and
christina
had
announced
with
sufficient
distinctness
that
she
had
said
to
scruples
it
was
her
fancy
at
present
to
treat
the
world
as
a
garden
of
pleasure
and
if
hitherto
she
had
played
with
roderick
s
passion
on
its
stem
there
was
little
doubt
that
now
she
would
pluck
it
with
an
unfaltering
hand
and
drain
it
of
its
acrid
sweetness
and
why
the
deuce
need
roderick
have
gone
marching
back
to
destruction
rowland
s
meditations
even
when
they
began
in
rancor
often
brought
him
peace
but
on
this
occasion
they
ushered
in
a
quite
peculiar
quality
of
unrest
he
felt
conscious
of
a
sudden
collapse
in
his
moral
energy
a
current
that
had
been
flowing
for
two
years
with
liquid
strength
seemed
at
last
to
pause
and
evaporate
rowland
looked
away
at
the
stagnant
vapors
on
the
mountains
their
dreariness
seemed
a
symbol
of
the
dreariness
which
his
own
generosity
had
bequeathed
him
at
last
he
had
arrived
at
the
uttermost
limit
of
the
deference
a
sane
man
might
pay
to
other
people
s
folly
nay
rather
he
had
transgressed
it
he
had
been
befooled
on
a
gigantic
scale
he
turned
to
his
book
and
tried
to
woo
back
patience
but
it
gave
him
cold
comfort
and
he
tossed
it
angrily
away
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
tried
to
wonder
dispassionately
whether
atmospheric
conditions
had
not
something
to
do
with
his
he
remained
for
some
time
in
this
attitude
but
was
finally
aroused
from
it
by
a
singular
sense
that
although
he
had
heard
nothing
some
one
had
approached
him
he
looked
up
and
saw
roderick
standing
before
him
on
the
turf
his
mood
made
the
spectacle
unwelcome
and
for
a
moment
he
felt
like
uttering
an
uncivil
speech
roderick
stood
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
countenance
which
had
of
late
become
rare
there
was
an
unfamiliar
spark
in
his
eye
and
a
certain
imperious
alertness
in
his
carriage
confirmed
habit
with
rowland
came
speedily
to
the
front
what
is
it
now
he
asked
himself
and
invited
roderick
to
sit
down
roderick
had
evidently
something
particular
to
say
and
if
he
remained
silent
for
a
time
it
was
not
because
he
was
ashamed
of
it
i
would
like
you
to
do
me
a
favor
he
said
at
last
lend
me
some
how
much
do
you
wish
rowland
asked
say
a
thousand
rowland
hesitated
a
moment
i
don
t
wish
to
be
indiscreet
but
may
i
ask
what
you
propose
to
do
with
a
thousand
francs
to
go
to
and
why
are
you
going
to
interlaken
roderick
replied
without
a
shadow
of
wavering
because
that
woman
is
to
be
rowland
burst
out
laughing
but
roderick
remained
serenely
grave
you
have
forgiven
her
then
said
rowland
not
a
bit
of
it
i
don
t
neither
do
i
only
know
that
she
is
incomparably
beautiful
and
that
she
has
waked
me
up
amazingly
besides
she
asked
me
to
she
asked
you
yesterday
in
so
many
ah
the
jade
exactly
i
am
willing
to
take
her
for
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
did
you
go
back
to
her
why
did
i
find
her
standing
there
like
a
goddess
who
had
just
stepped
out
of
her
cloud
why
did
i
look
at
her
before
i
knew
where
i
was
the
harm
was
rowland
who
had
been
sitting
erect
threw
himself
back
on
the
grass
and
lay
for
some
time
staring
up
at
the
sky
at
last
raising
himself
are
you
perfectly
serious
he
asked
deadly
your
idea
is
to
remain
at
interlaken
some
time
indefinitely
said
roderick
and
it
seemed
to
his
companion
that
the
tone
in
which
he
said
this
made
it
immensely
well
worth
hearing
and
your
mother
and
cousin
meanwhile
are
to
remain
here
it
will
soon
be
getting
very
cold
you
it
does
n
t
seem
much
like
it
very
true
but
is
a
day
by
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
their
going
back
to
lucerne
i
depend
upon
your
taking
charge
of
at
this
rowland
reclined
upon
the
grass
again
and
again
after
reflection
he
faced
his
friend
how
would
you
express
he
asked
the
character
of
the
profit
that
you
expect
to
derive
from
your
excursion
i
see
no
need
of
expressing
it
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
the
case
is
simply
this
i
desire
immensely
to
be
near
christina
light
and
it
is
such
a
huge
refreshment
to
find
myself
again
desiring
something
that
i
propose
to
drift
with
the
current
as
i
say
she
has
waked
me
up
and
it
is
possible
something
may
come
of
it
she
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
were
alive
again
this
and
he
glanced
down
at
the
inn
i
call
death
that
i
am
very
grateful
to
hear
you
really
feel
as
if
you
might
do
something
don
t
ask
too
much
i
only
know
that
she
makes
my
heart
beat
makes
me
see
you
feel
encouraged
i
feel
you
are
really
looking
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
now
that
i
have
answered
your
questions
please
to
give
me
the
rowland
shook
his
head
for
that
purpose
i
can
t
you
can
t
it
s
impossible
your
plan
is
rank
folly
i
can
t
help
you
in
roderick
flushed
a
little
and
his
eye
expanded
i
will
borrow
what
money
i
can
then
from
mary
this
was
not
viciously
said
it
had
simply
the
ring
of
passionate
resolution
instantly
it
brought
rowland
to
terms
he
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
upon
the
grass
the
little
brass
one
opens
my
he
said
you
will
find
money
in
roderick
let
the
keys
lie
something
seemed
to
have
struck
him
he
looked
askance
at
his
friend
you
are
awfully
gallant
you
certainly
are
not
your
proposal
is
an
very
likely
it
s
a
proof
the
more
of
my
if
you
have
so
much
steam
on
then
use
it
for
something
else
you
say
you
are
awake
again
i
am
delighted
only
be
so
in
the
best
sense
is
n
t
it
very
plain
if
you
have
the
energy
to
desire
you
have
also
the
energy
to
reason
and
to
judge
if
you
can
care
to
go
you
can
also
care
to
stay
and
staying
being
the
more
profitable
course
the
inspiration
on
that
side
for
a
man
who
has
his
to
win
back
again
should
be
roderick
plainly
did
not
relish
this
simple
logic
and
his
eye
grew
angry
as
he
listened
to
its
echo
oh
the
devil
he
cried
rowland
went
on
do
you
believe
that
hanging
about
christina
light
will
do
you
any
good
do
you
believe
it
won
t
in
either
case
you
should
keep
away
from
her
if
it
won
t
it
s
your
duty
and
if
it
will
you
can
get
on
without
do
me
good
cried
roderick
what
do
i
want
of
good
what
should
i
do
with
good
i
want
what
she
gives
me
call
it
by
what
name
you
will
i
want
to
ask
no
questions
but
to
take
what
comes
and
let
it
fill
the
impossible
hours
but
i
did
n
t
come
to
discuss
the
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
discuss
it
said
rowland
i
simply
roderick
meditated
a
moment
i
have
never
yet
thought
twice
of
accepting
a
favor
of
you
he
said
at
last
but
this
one
sticks
in
my
it
is
not
a
favor
i
lend
you
the
money
only
under
well
then
i
will
take
it
only
under
compulsion
roderick
exclaimed
and
he
sprang
up
abruptly
and
marched
away
his
words
were
ambiguous
rowland
lay
on
the
grass
wondering
what
they
meant
half
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
before
roderick
reappeared
heated
with
rapid
walking
and
wiping
his
forehead
he
flung
himself
down
and
looked
at
his
friend
with
an
eye
which
expressed
something
purer
than
bravado
and
yet
baser
than
conviction
i
have
done
my
best
he
said
my
mother
is
out
of
money
she
is
expecting
next
week
some
circular
notes
from
london
she
had
only
ten
francs
in
her
pocket
mary
garland
gave
me
every
sou
she
possessed
in
the
world
it
makes
exactly
francs
that
s
not
you
asked
miss
garland
cried
rowland
i
asked
and
told
her
your
purpose
i
named
no
names
but
she
knew
what
did
she
say
not
a
syllable
she
simply
emptied
her
rowland
turned
over
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
he
felt
a
movement
of
irrepressible
elation
and
he
barely
stifled
a
cry
of
joy
now
surely
roderick
had
shattered
the
last
link
in
the
chain
that
bound
mary
to
him
and
after
this
she
would
be
free
when
he
turned
about
again
roderick
was
still
sitting
there
and
he
had
not
touched
the
keys
which
lay
on
the
grass
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
said
roderick
but
i
have
an
insurmountable
aversion
to
taking
your
the
matter
i
suppose
is
that
you
have
a
grain
of
wisdom
no
it
s
not
that
it
s
a
kind
of
brute
instinct
i
find
it
extremely
provoking
he
sat
there
for
some
time
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
his
lips
were
compressed
and
he
was
evidently
in
fact
in
a
state
of
profound
irritation
you
have
succeeded
in
making
this
thing
excessively
unpleasant
he
exclaimed
i
am
sorry
said
rowland
but
i
can
t
see
it
in
any
other
that
i
believe
and
i
resent
the
range
of
your
vision
pretending
to
be
the
limit
of
my
action
you
can
t
feel
for
me
nor
judge
for
me
and
there
are
certain
things
you
know
nothing
about
i
have
suffered
sir
roderick
went
on
with
increasing
emphasis
i
have
suffered
damnable
torments
have
i
been
such
a
placid
contented
comfortable
man
this
last
six
months
that
when
i
find
a
chance
to
forget
my
misery
i
should
take
such
pains
not
to
profit
by
it
you
ask
too
much
for
a
man
who
himself
has
no
occasion
to
play
the
hero
i
don
t
say
that
invidiously
it
s
your
disposition
and
you
can
t
help
it
but
decidedly
there
are
certain
things
you
know
nothing
rowland
listened
to
this
outbreak
with
open
eyes
and
roderick
if
he
had
been
less
intent
upon
his
own
eloquence
would
probably
have
perceived
that
he
turned
pale
these
things
what
are
they
rowland
asked
they
are
women
principally
and
what
relates
to
women
women
for
you
by
what
i
can
make
out
mean
nothing
you
have
no
imagination
no
sensibility
that
s
a
serious
charge
said
rowland
gravely
i
don
t
make
it
without
proof
and
what
is
your
proof
roderick
hesitated
a
moment
the
way
you
treated
christina
light
i
call
that
grossly
obtuse
rowland
repeated
frowning
beneath
your
good
my
good
fortune
there
it
is
it
s
all
news
to
you
you
had
pleased
her
i
don
t
say
she
was
dying
of
love
for
you
but
she
took
a
fancy
to
we
will
let
this
pass
said
rowland
after
a
silence
oh
i
don
t
insist
i
have
only
her
own
word
for
she
told
you
this
you
noticed
at
least
i
suppose
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
speak
i
never
repeated
it
not
because
i
was
jealous
but
because
i
was
curious
to
see
how
long
your
ignorance
would
last
if
left
to
i
frankly
confess
it
would
have
lasted
forever
and
yet
i
don
t
consider
that
my
insensibility
is
oh
don
t
say
that
cried
roderick
or
i
shall
begin
to
suspect
what
i
must
do
you
the
justice
to
say
that
i
never
have
suspected
that
you
are
a
trifle
conceited
upon
my
word
when
i
think
of
all
this
your
protest
as
you
call
it
against
my
following
christina
light
seems
to
me
thoroughly
offensive
there
is
something
monstrous
in
a
man
s
pretending
to
lay
down
the
law
to
a
sort
of
emotion
with
which
he
is
quite
unacquainted
in
his
asking
a
fellow
to
give
up
a
lovely
woman
for
conscience
sake
when
he
has
never
had
the
impulse
to
strike
a
blow
for
one
for
passion
s
oh
oh
cried
rowland
all
that
s
very
easy
to
say
roderick
went
on
but
you
must
remember
that
there
are
such
things
as
nerves
and
senses
and
imagination
and
a
restless
demon
within
that
may
sleep
sometimes
for
a
day
or
for
six
months
but
that
sooner
or
later
wakes
up
and
thumps
at
your
ribs
till
you
listen
to
him
if
you
can
t
understand
it
take
it
on
trust
and
let
a
poor
imaginative
devil
live
his
life
as
he
can
roderick
s
words
seemed
at
first
to
rowland
like
something
heard
in
a
dream
it
was
impossible
they
had
been
actually
spoken
so
supreme
an
expression
were
they
of
the
insolence
of
egotism
reality
was
never
so
consistent
as
that
but
roderick
sat
there
balancing
his
beautiful
head
and
the
echoes
of
his
strident
accent
still
lingered
along
the
rowland
suddenly
felt
that
the
cup
of
his
chagrin
was
full
to
overflowing
and
his
bitterness
surged
into
the
simple
wholesome
passion
of
anger
for
wasted
kindness
but
he
spoke
without
violence
and
roderick
was
probably
at
first
far
from
measuring
the
force
that
lay
beneath
his
words
you
are
incredibly
ungrateful
he
said
you
are
talking
arrogant
nonsense
what
do
you
know
about
my
sensibilities
and
my
imagination
how
do
you
know
whether
i
have
loved
or
suffered
if
i
have
held
my
tongue
and
not
troubled
you
with
my
complaints
you
find
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
put
an
ignoble
construction
on
my
silence
i
loved
quite
as
well
as
you
indeed
i
think
i
may
say
rather
better
i
have
been
constant
i
have
been
willing
to
give
more
than
i
received
i
have
not
forsaken
one
mistress
because
i
thought
another
more
beautiful
nor
given
up
the
other
and
believed
all
manner
of
evil
about
her
because
i
had
not
my
way
with
her
i
have
been
a
good
friend
to
christina
light
and
it
seems
to
me
my
friendship
does
her
quite
as
much
honor
as
your
love
your
love
your
suffering
your
silence
your
friendship
cried
roderick
i
declare
i
don
t
understand
i
dare
say
not
you
are
not
used
to
understanding
such
things
you
are
not
used
to
hearing
me
talk
of
my
feelings
you
are
altogether
too
much
taken
up
with
your
own
be
as
much
so
as
you
please
i
have
always
respected
your
right
only
when
i
have
kept
myself
in
durance
on
purpose
to
leave
you
an
open
field
don
t
by
way
of
thanking
me
come
and
call
me
an
oh
you
claim
then
that
you
have
made
sacrifices
several
you
have
never
suspected
it
if
i
had
do
you
suppose
i
would
have
allowed
it
cried
roderick
they
were
the
sacrifices
of
friendship
and
they
were
easily
made
only
i
don
t
enjoy
having
them
thrown
back
in
my
this
was
under
the
circumstances
a
sufficiently
generous
speech
but
roderick
was
not
in
the
humor
to
take
it
generously
come
be
more
definite
he
said
let
me
know
where
it
is
the
shoe
has
rowland
frowned
if
roderick
would
not
take
generosity
he
should
have
full
justice
it
s
a
perpetual
sacrifice
he
said
to
live
with
a
perfect
i
am
an
egotist
cried
roderick
did
it
never
occur
to
you
an
egotist
to
whom
you
have
made
perpetual
sacrifices
he
repeated
the
words
in
a
singular
tone
a
tone
that
denoted
neither
exactly
indignation
nor
incredulity
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
a
sudden
violent
curiosity
for
news
about
himself
you
are
selfish
said
rowland
you
think
only
of
yourself
and
believe
only
in
yourself
you
regard
other
people
only
as
they
play
into
your
own
hands
you
have
always
been
very
frank
about
it
and
the
thing
seemed
so
mixed
up
with
the
temper
of
your
genius
and
the
very
structure
of
your
mind
that
often
one
was
willing
to
take
the
evil
with
the
good
and
to
be
thankful
that
considering
your
great
talent
you
were
no
worse
but
if
one
believed
in
you
as
i
have
done
one
paid
a
tax
upon
roderick
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
clasped
his
hands
together
and
crossed
them
shadewise
over
his
eyes
in
this
attitude
for
a
moment
he
sat
looking
coldly
at
his
friend
so
i
have
made
you
very
uncomfortable
he
went
on
extremely
i
have
been
eager
grasping
obstinate
vain
ungrateful
indifferent
cruel
i
have
accused
you
mentally
of
all
these
things
with
the
exception
of
you
have
often
hated
me
never
i
should
have
parted
company
with
you
before
coming
to
but
you
have
wanted
to
part
company
to
bid
me
go
my
way
and
be
hanged
repeatedly
then
i
have
had
patience
and
forgiven
forgiven
me
eh
suffering
all
the
while
yes
you
may
call
it
why
did
you
never
tell
me
all
this
before
because
my
affection
was
always
stronger
than
my
resentment
because
i
preferred
to
err
on
the
side
of
kindness
because
i
had
myself
in
a
measure
launched
you
in
the
world
and
thrown
you
into
temptations
and
because
nothing
short
of
your
unwarrantable
aggression
just
now
could
have
made
me
say
these
painful
roderick
picked
up
a
blade
of
long
grass
and
began
to
bite
it
rowland
was
puzzled
by
his
expression
and
manner
they
seemed
strangely
cynical
there
was
something
revolting
in
his
deepening
calmness
i
must
have
been
hideous
roderick
presently
resumed
i
am
not
talking
for
your
entertainment
said
rowland
of
course
not
for
my
edification
as
roderick
said
these
words
there
was
not
a
ray
of
warmth
in
his
brilliant
eye
i
have
spoken
for
my
own
relief
rowland
went
on
and
so
that
you
need
never
again
go
so
utterly
astray
as
you
have
done
this
it
has
been
a
terrible
mistake
then
what
his
tone
expressed
was
not
willful
mockery
but
a
kind
of
persistent
irresponsibility
which
rowland
found
equally
exasperating
he
answered
nothing
and
all
this
time
roderick
continued
you
have
been
in
love
tell
me
the
rowland
felt
an
immense
desire
to
give
him
a
visible
palpable
pang
her
name
is
mary
garland
he
said
apparently
he
succeeded
the
surprise
was
great
roderick
colored
as
he
had
never
done
mary
garland
heaven
forgive
us
rowland
observed
the
us
roderick
threw
himself
back
on
the
turf
the
latter
lay
for
some
time
staring
at
the
sky
at
last
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
rowland
rose
also
rejoicing
keenly
it
must
be
confessed
in
his
companion
s
confusion
for
how
long
has
this
been
roderick
demanded
since
i
first
knew
two
years
and
you
have
never
told
her
you
have
told
no
one
you
are
the
first
why
have
you
been
silent
because
of
your
but
you
have
done
your
best
to
keep
that
that
s
another
matter
it
s
very
strange
said
roderick
presently
it
s
like
something
in
a
we
need
n
t
expatiate
on
it
said
rowland
all
i
wished
to
do
was
to
rebut
your
charge
that
i
am
an
abnormal
but
still
roderick
pondered
all
these
months
while
i
was
going
on
i
wish
you
had
mentioned
i
acted
as
was
necessary
and
that
s
the
end
of
you
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
her
the
i
remember
now
your
occasionally
expressing
it
and
my
being
struck
with
it
but
i
never
dreamed
you
were
in
love
with
her
it
s
a
pity
she
does
n
t
care
for
you
rowland
had
made
his
point
and
he
had
no
wish
to
prolong
the
conversation
but
he
had
a
desire
to
hear
more
of
this
and
he
remained
silent
you
hope
i
suppose
that
some
day
she
may
i
should
n
t
have
offered
to
say
so
but
since
you
ask
me
i
i
don
t
believe
it
she
idolizes
me
and
if
she
never
were
to
see
me
again
she
would
idolize
my
this
might
be
profound
insight
and
it
might
be
profound
fatuity
rowland
turned
away
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
my
indifference
my
neglect
of
her
must
have
seemed
to
you
horrible
altogether
i
must
have
appeared
simply
do
you
really
care
rowland
asked
what
you
appeared
certainly
i
have
been
damnably
stupid
is
n
t
an
artist
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
perceptions
i
am
hugely
well
you
understand
now
and
we
can
start
and
yet
said
roderick
though
you
have
suffered
in
a
degree
i
don
t
believe
you
have
suffered
so
much
as
some
other
men
would
have
very
likely
not
in
such
matters
quantitative
analysis
is
roderick
picked
up
his
stick
and
stood
looking
at
the
ground
nevertheless
i
must
have
seemed
hideous
he
repeated
he
turned
away
scowling
and
rowland
offered
no
contradiction
they
were
both
silent
for
some
time
and
at
last
roderick
gave
a
heavy
sigh
and
began
to
walk
away
where
are
you
going
rowland
then
asked
oh
i
don
t
care
to
walk
you
have
given
me
something
to
think
this
seemed
a
salutary
impulse
and
yet
rowland
felt
a
nameless
perplexity
to
have
been
so
stupid
damns
me
more
than
anything
roderick
went
on
certainly
i
can
shut
up
shop
rowland
felt
in
no
smiling
humor
and
yet
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
almost
have
smiled
at
the
very
consistency
of
the
fellow
it
was
egotism
still
aesthetic
disgust
at
the
graceless
contour
of
his
conduct
but
never
a
hint
of
simple
sorrow
for
the
pain
he
had
given
rowland
let
him
go
and
for
some
moments
stood
watching
him
suddenly
mallet
became
conscious
of
a
singular
and
most
illogical
impulse
a
desire
to
stop
him
to
have
another
word
with
him
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
he
called
him
and
roderick
turned
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
said
rowland
i
am
fit
only
to
be
alone
i
am
damned
you
had
better
not
think
of
it
at
all
rowland
cried
than
think
in
that
there
is
only
one
way
i
have
been
hideous
and
he
broke
off
and
marched
away
with
his
long
elastic
step
swinging
his
stick
rowland
watched
him
and
at
the
end
of
a
moment
called
to
him
roderick
stopped
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
then
abruptly
turned
and
disappeared
below
the
crest
of
a
hill
rowland
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
uncomfortably
he
was
half
irritated
half
depressed
he
had
an
insufferable
feeling
of
having
been
placed
in
the
wrong
in
spite
of
his
excellent
cause
roderick
did
not
come
home
to
dinner
but
of
this
with
his
passion
for
brooding
away
the
hours
on
mountain
sides
he
had
almost
made
a
habit
hudson
appeared
at
the
noonday
repast
with
a
face
which
showed
that
roderick
s
demand
for
money
had
unsealed
the
fountains
of
her
distress
little
singleton
consumed
an
enormous
and
dinner
miss
garland
rowland
observed
had
not
contributed
her
scanty
assistance
to
her
kinsman
s
pursuit
of
the
princess
casamassima
without
an
effort
the
effort
was
visible
in
her
pale
face
and
her
silence
she
looked
so
ill
that
when
they
left
the
table
rowland
felt
almost
bound
to
remark
upon
it
they
had
come
out
upon
the
grass
in
front
of
the
inn
i
have
a
headache
she
said
and
then
suddenly
looking
about
at
the
menacing
sky
and
motionless
air
it
s
this
horrible
day
rowland
that
afternoon
tried
to
write
a
letter
to
his
cousin
cecilia
but
his
head
and
his
heart
were
alike
heavy
and
he
traced
upon
the
paper
but
a
single
line
i
believe
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
reasonable
but
when
once
the
habit
is
formed
what
is
one
to
do
he
had
occasion
to
use
his
keys
and
he
felt
for
them
in
his
pocket
they
were
missing
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
them
lying
on
the
where
he
had
had
his
talk
with
roderick
he
went
forth
in
search
of
them
and
found
them
where
he
had
thrown
them
he
flung
himself
down
in
the
same
place
again
he
felt
indisposed
to
walk
he
was
conscious
that
his
mood
had
vastly
changed
since
the
morning
his
extraordinary
acute
sense
of
his
rights
had
been
replaced
by
the
familiar
chronic
sense
of
his
duties
only
his
duties
now
seemed
impracticable
he
turned
over
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
he
lay
so
a
long
time
thinking
of
many
things
the
sum
of
them
all
was
that
roderick
had
beaten
him
at
last
he
was
startled
by
an
extraordinary
sound
it
took
him
a
moment
to
perceive
that
it
was
a
portentous
growl
of
thunder
he
roused
himself
and
saw
that
the
whole
face
of
the
sky
had
altered
the
clouds
that
had
hung
motionless
all
day
were
moving
from
their
stations
and
getting
into
position
as
it
were
for
a
battle
the
wind
was
rising
the
sallow
vapors
were
turning
dark
and
consolidating
their
masses
it
was
a
striking
spectacle
but
rowland
judged
best
to
observe
it
briefly
as
a
storm
was
evidently
imminent
he
took
his
way
down
to
the
inn
and
found
singleton
still
at
his
post
profiting
by
the
last
of
the
light
to
finish
his
study
and
yet
at
the
same
time
taking
rapid
notes
of
the
actual
condition
of
the
clouds
we
are
going
to
have
a
most
interesting
storm
the
little
painter
gleefully
cried
i
should
like
awfully
to
do
rowland
adjured
him
to
pack
up
his
tools
and
decamp
and
repaired
to
the
house
the
air
by
this
time
had
become
portentously
dark
and
the
thunder
was
incessant
and
tremendous
in
the
midst
of
it
the
lightning
flashed
and
vanished
like
the
treble
shrilling
upon
the
bass
the
innkeeper
and
his
servants
had
crowded
to
the
doorway
and
were
looking
at
the
scene
with
faces
which
seemed
a
proof
that
it
was
unprecedented
as
rowland
approached
the
group
divided
to
let
some
one
pass
from
within
and
hudson
came
forth
as
white
as
a
corpse
and
trembling
in
every
limb
my
boy
my
boy
where
is
my
boy
she
cried
mr
mallet
why
are
you
here
without
him
bring
him
to
me
has
no
one
seen
hudson
rowland
asked
of
the
others
has
he
not
returned
each
one
shook
his
head
and
looked
grave
and
rowland
attempted
to
reassure
hudson
by
saying
that
of
course
he
had
taken
refuge
in
a
chalet
go
and
find
him
go
and
find
him
she
cried
insanely
don
t
stand
there
and
talk
or
i
shall
die
it
was
now
as
dark
as
evening
and
rowland
could
just
distinguish
the
figure
of
singleton
scampering
homeward
with
his
box
and
easel
and
where
is
mary
hudson
went
on
what
in
mercy
s
name
has
become
of
her
mallet
why
did
you
ever
bring
us
here
there
came
a
prodigious
flash
of
lightning
and
the
limitless
tumult
about
them
turned
clearer
than
midsummer
noonday
the
brightness
lasted
long
enough
to
enable
rowland
to
see
a
woman
s
figure
on
the
top
of
an
eminence
near
the
house
it
was
mary
garland
questioning
the
lurid
darkness
for
roderick
rowland
sprang
out
to
interrupt
her
vigil
but
in
a
moment
he
encountered
her
retreating
he
seized
her
hand
and
hurried
her
to
the
house
where
as
soon
as
she
stepped
into
the
covered
gallery
hudson
fell
upon
her
with
frantic
lamentations
did
you
see
nothing
nothing
she
cried
tell
mallet
he
must
go
and
find
him
with
some
men
some
lights
some
wrappings
go
go
go
sir
in
mercy
go
rowland
was
extremely
perturbed
by
the
poor
lady
s
vociferous
folly
for
he
deemed
her
anxiety
superfluous
he
had
offered
his
suggestion
with
sincerity
nothing
was
more
probable
than
that
roderick
had
found
shelter
in
a
herdsman
s
cabin
these
were
numerous
on
the
neighboring
mountains
and
the
storm
had
given
fair
warning
of
its
approach
miss
garland
stood
there
very
pale
saying
nothing
but
looking
at
him
he
expected
that
she
would
check
her
cousin
s
importunity
could
you
find
him
she
suddenly
asked
would
it
be
of
use
the
question
seemed
to
him
a
flash
intenser
than
the
lightning
that
was
raking
the
sky
before
them
it
shattered
his
dream
that
he
weighed
in
the
scale
but
before
he
could
answer
the
full
fury
of
the
storm
was
upon
them
the
rain
descended
in
sounding
torrents
every
one
fell
back
into
the
house
there
had
been
no
time
to
light
lamps
and
in
the
little
uncarpeted
parlor
in
the
unnatural
darkness
rowland
felt
mary
s
hand
upon
his
arm
for
a
moment
it
had
an
eloquent
pressure
it
seemed
to
retract
her
senseless
challenge
and
to
say
that
she
believed
for
roderick
what
he
believed
but
nevertheless
thought
rowland
the
cry
had
come
her
heart
had
spoken
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
sacrifice
him
he
had
been
uncertain
before
here
at
least
was
the
comfort
of
certainty
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
certainty
in
question
did
little
to
enliven
the
gloom
of
that
formidable
evening
there
was
a
noisy
crowd
about
him
in
the
room
noisy
even
with
the
accompaniment
of
the
continual
lodgers
and
servants
chattering
shuffling
and
bustling
and
annoying
him
equally
by
making
too
light
of
the
tempest
and
by
vociferating
their
alarm
in
the
disorder
it
was
some
time
before
a
lamp
was
lighted
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
as
it
was
swung
from
the
ceiling
was
the
white
face
of
hudson
who
was
being
carried
out
of
the
room
in
a
swoon
by
two
stout
with
mary
garland
forcing
a
passage
he
rendered
what
help
he
could
but
when
they
had
laid
the
poor
woman
on
her
bed
miss
garland
motioned
him
away
i
think
you
make
her
worse
she
said
rowland
went
to
his
own
chamber
the
partitions
in
swiss
are
thin
and
from
time
to
time
he
heard
hudson
moaning
three
rooms
off
considering
its
great
fury
the
storm
took
long
to
expend
itself
it
was
upwards
of
three
hours
before
the
thunder
ceased
but
even
then
the
rain
continued
to
fall
heavily
and
the
night
which
had
come
on
was
impenetrably
black
this
lasted
till
near
midnight
rowland
thought
of
mary
garland
s
challenge
in
the
porch
but
he
thought
even
more
that
although
the
fetid
interior
of
a
chalet
may
offer
a
convenient
refuge
from
an
alpine
tempest
there
was
no
possible
music
in
the
universe
so
sweet
as
the
sound
of
roderick
s
voice
at
midnight
through
his
dripping
he
saw
a
star
and
he
immediately
went
downstairs
and
out
into
the
gallery
the
rain
had
ceased
the
were
dissevered
here
and
there
and
several
stars
were
visible
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
turning
saw
miss
garland
he
asked
about
hudson
and
learned
that
she
was
sleeping
exhausted
by
her
fruitless
lamentations
miss
garland
kept
scanning
the
darkness
but
she
said
nothing
to
cast
doubt
on
roderick
s
having
found
a
refuge
rowland
noticed
it
this
also
have
i
guaranteed
he
said
to
himself
there
was
something
that
mary
wished
to
learn
and
a
question
presently
revealed
it
what
made
him
start
on
a
long
walk
so
suddenly
she
asked
i
saw
him
at
eleven
o
clock
and
then
he
meant
to
go
to
engelberg
and
on
his
way
to
interlaken
rowland
said
yes
she
answered
under
cover
of
the
darkness
we
had
some
talk
said
rowland
and
he
seemed
for
the
day
to
have
given
up
did
you
dissuade
him
not
exactly
we
discussed
another
question
which
for
the
time
superseded
his
miss
garland
was
silent
then
may
i
ask
whether
your
discussion
was
violent
she
said
i
am
afraid
it
was
agreeable
to
neither
of
and
roderick
left
you
in
in
irritation
i
offered
him
my
company
on
his
walk
he
declined
miss
garland
paced
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
then
came
back
if
he
had
gone
to
engelberg
she
said
he
would
have
reached
the
hotel
before
the
storm
rowland
felt
a
sudden
explosion
of
ferocity
oh
if
you
like
he
cried
he
can
start
for
interlaken
as
soon
as
he
comes
back
but
she
did
not
even
notice
his
wrath
will
he
come
back
early
she
went
on
we
may
suppose
he
will
know
how
anxious
we
are
and
he
will
start
with
the
first
light
rowland
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
that
roderick
s
readiness
to
throw
himself
into
the
feelings
of
others
made
this
extremely
probable
but
he
checked
himself
and
said
simply
i
expect
him
at
miss
garland
bent
her
eyes
once
more
upon
the
irresponsive
darkness
and
then
in
silence
went
into
the
house
rowland
it
must
be
averred
in
spite
of
his
resolution
not
to
be
nervous
found
no
sleep
that
night
when
the
early
dawn
began
to
tremble
in
the
east
he
came
forth
again
into
the
open
air
the
storm
had
completely
purged
the
atmosphere
and
the
day
gave
promise
of
cloudless
splendor
rowland
watched
the
early
slowly
reaching
higher
and
remembered
that
if
roderick
did
not
come
back
to
breakfast
there
were
two
things
to
be
taken
into
account
one
was
the
heaviness
of
the
soil
on
the
saturated
with
the
rain
this
would
make
him
walk
slowly
the
other
was
the
fact
that
speaking
without
irony
he
was
not
remarkable
for
throwing
himself
into
the
sentiments
of
others
breakfast
at
the
inn
was
early
and
by
roderick
had
not
appeared
then
rowland
admitted
that
he
was
nervous
neither
hudson
nor
miss
garland
had
left
their
apartment
rowland
had
a
mental
vision
of
them
sitting
there
praying
and
listening
he
had
no
desire
to
see
them
more
directly
there
were
a
couple
of
men
who
hung
about
the
inn
as
guides
for
the
ascent
of
the
titlis
rowland
sent
each
of
them
forth
in
a
different
direction
to
ask
the
news
of
roderick
at
every
chalet
door
within
a
morning
s
walk
then
he
called
sam
singleton
whose
peregrinations
had
made
him
an
excellent
mountaineer
and
whose
zeal
and
sympathy
were
now
unbounded
and
the
two
started
together
on
a
voyage
of
research
by
the
time
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
inn
rowland
was
obliged
to
confess
that
decidedly
roderick
had
had
time
to
come
back
he
wandered
about
for
several
hours
but
he
found
only
the
sunny
stillness
of
the
before
long
he
parted
company
with
singleton
who
to
his
suggestion
that
separation
would
multiply
their
resources
assented
with
a
silent
frightened
look
which
reflected
too
vividly
his
own
thought
the
day
was
magnificent
the
sun
was
everywhere
the
storm
had
lashed
the
lower
slopes
into
a
deeper
flush
of
autumnal
color
and
the
reared
themselves
against
the
near
horizon
in
glaring
blocks
and
dazzling
spires
rowland
made
his
way
to
several
chalets
but
most
of
them
were
empty
he
thumped
at
their
low
foul
doors
with
a
kind
of
nervous
savage
anger
he
challenged
the
stupid
silence
to
tell
him
something
about
his
friend
some
of
these
places
had
evidently
not
been
open
in
months
the
silence
everywhere
was
horrible
it
seemed
to
mock
at
his
impatience
and
to
be
a
conscious
symbol
of
calamity
in
the
midst
of
it
at
the
door
of
one
of
the
chalets
quite
alone
sat
a
hideous
cretin
who
grinned
at
rowland
over
his
goitre
when
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
questioned
him
the
creature
s
family
was
scattered
on
the
he
could
give
rowland
no
help
to
find
them
rowland
climbed
into
many
awkward
places
and
skirted
intently
and
peeringly
many
an
ugly
chasm
and
ledge
but
the
sun
as
i
have
said
was
everywhere
it
illumined
the
deep
places
over
which
not
knowing
where
to
turn
next
he
halted
and
lingered
and
showed
him
nothing
but
the
stony
alpine
void
nothing
so
human
even
as
death
at
noon
he
paused
in
his
quest
and
sat
down
on
a
stone
the
conviction
was
pressing
upon
him
that
the
worst
that
was
now
possible
was
true
he
suspended
his
search
he
was
afraid
to
go
on
he
sat
there
for
an
hour
sick
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
without
his
knowing
why
several
things
chiefly
trivial
that
had
happened
during
the
last
two
years
and
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
became
vividly
present
to
his
mind
he
was
aroused
at
last
by
the
sound
of
a
stone
dislodged
near
by
which
rattled
down
the
mountain
in
a
moment
on
a
steep
rocky
slope
opposite
to
him
he
beheld
a
figure
cautiously
descending
a
figure
which
was
not
roderick
it
was
singleton
who
had
seen
him
and
began
to
beckon
to
him
come
down
come
down
cried
the
painter
steadily
making
his
own
way
down
rowland
saw
that
as
he
moved
and
even
as
he
selected
his
foothold
and
watched
his
steps
he
was
looking
at
something
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
this
was
a
great
rugged
wall
which
had
fallen
backward
from
the
perpendicular
and
the
descent
though
difficult
was
with
care
sufficiently
practicable
what
do
you
see
cried
rowland
singleton
stopped
looked
across
at
him
and
seemed
to
hesitate
then
come
down
come
down
he
simply
repeated
rowland
s
course
was
also
a
steep
descent
and
he
attacked
it
so
precipitately
that
he
afterwards
marveled
he
had
not
broken
his
neck
it
was
a
ten
minutes
headlong
scramble
down
he
saw
something
that
made
him
dizzy
he
saw
what
singleton
had
seen
in
the
gorge
below
them
a
vague
white
mass
lay
tumbled
upon
the
stones
he
let
himself
go
blindly
fiercely
singleton
had
reached
the
rocky
bottom
of
the
ravine
before
him
and
had
bounded
forward
and
fallen
upon
his
knees
rowland
overtook
him
and
his
own
legs
collapsed
the
thing
that
yesterday
was
his
friend
lay
before
him
as
the
chance
of
the
last
breath
had
left
it
and
out
of
it
roderick
s
face
stared
upward
at
the
sky
he
had
fallen
from
a
great
height
but
he
was
singularly
little
disfigured
the
rain
had
spent
its
torrents
upon
him
and
his
clothes
and
hair
were
as
wet
as
if
the
billows
of
the
ocean
had
flung
him
upon
the
strand
an
attempt
to
move
him
would
show
some
hideous
fracture
some
horrible
physical
dishonor
but
what
rowland
saw
on
first
looking
at
him
was
only
a
strangely
serene
expression
of
life
the
eyes
were
dead
but
in
a
short
time
when
rowland
had
closed
them
the
whole
face
seemed
to
awake
the
rain
had
washed
away
all
blood
it
was
as
if
violence
having
done
her
work
had
stolen
away
in
shame
roderick
s
face
might
have
shamed
her
it
looked
admirably
handsome
he
was
a
beautiful
man
said
singleton
they
looked
up
through
their
horror
at
the
cliff
from
which
he
had
apparently
fallen
and
which
lifted
its
blank
and
stony
face
above
him
with
no
care
now
but
to
drink
the
sunshine
on
which
his
eyes
were
closed
and
then
rowland
had
an
immense
outbreak
of
pity
and
anguish
at
last
they
spoke
of
carrying
him
back
to
the
inn
there
must
be
three
or
four
men
rowland
said
and
they
must
be
brought
here
quickly
i
have
not
the
least
idea
where
we
we
are
at
about
three
hours
walk
from
home
said
singleton
i
will
go
for
help
i
can
find
my
remember
said
rowland
whom
you
will
have
to
i
remember
the
excellent
fellow
answered
there
was
nothing
i
could
ever
do
for
him
in
life
i
will
do
what
i
can
he
went
off
and
rowland
stayed
there
alone
he
watched
for
seven
long
hours
and
his
vigil
was
forever
memorable
the
most
rational
of
men
was
for
an
hour
the
most
passionate
he
reviled
himself
with
transcendent
bitterness
he
accused
himself
of
cruelty
and
injustice
he
would
have
lain
down
there
in
roderick
s
place
to
unsay
the
words
that
had
yesterday
driven
him
forth
on
his
lonely
ramble
roderick
had
been
fond
of
saying
that
there
are
such
things
as
necessary
follies
and
rowland
was
now
proving
it
at
last
he
grew
almost
used
to
the
dumb
exultation
of
the
cliff
above
him
he
saw
that
roderick
was
a
mass
of
hideous
injury
and
he
tried
to
understand
what
had
happened
not
that
it
helped
him
before
that
confounding
mortality
one
hypothesis
after
another
faltered
and
swooned
away
roderick
s
passionate
walk
had
carried
him
farther
and
higher
than
he
knew
he
had
outstayed
supposably
the
first
menace
of
the
storm
and
perhaps
even
found
a
defiant
entertainment
in
watching
it
perhaps
he
had
simply
lost
himself
the
tempest
had
overtaken
him
and
when
he
tried
to
return
it
was
too
late
he
had
attempted
to
descend
the
cliff
in
the
darkness
he
had
made
the
inevitable
slip
and
whether
he
had
fallen
fifty
feet
or
three
hundred
little
mattered
the
condition
of
his
body
indicated
the
shorter
fall
now
that
all
was
over
rowland
understood
how
exclusively
for
two
years
roderick
had
filled
his
life
his
occupation
was
gone
singleton
came
back
with
four
men
one
of
them
the
landlord
of
the
inn
they
had
formed
a
sort
of
rude
bier
of
the
frame
of
a
chaise
a
porteurs
and
by
taking
a
very
course
homeward
were
able
to
follow
a
tolerably
level
path
and
carry
their
burden
with
a
certain
decency
to
rowland
it
seemed
as
if
the
little
procession
would
never
reach
the
inn
but
as
they
drew
near
it
he
would
have
given
his
right
hand
for
a
longer
delay
the
people
of
the
inn
came
forward
to
meet
them
in
a
little
silent
solemn
convoy
in
the
doorway
clinging
together
appeared
the
two
bereaved
women
hudson
tottered
forward
with
outstretched
hands
and
the
expression
of
a
blind
person
but
before
she
reached
her
son
mary
garland
had
rushed
past
her
and
in
the
face
of
the
staring
pitying
crowd
had
flung
herself
with
the
magnificent
movement
of
one
whose
rights
were
supreme
and
with
a
loud
tremendous
cry
upon
the
senseless
vestige
of
her
love
that
cry
still
lives
in
rowland
s
ears
it
interposes
persistently
against
the
reflection
that
when
he
sometimes
very
rarely
sees
her
she
is
unreservedly
kind
to
him
against
the
memory
that
during
the
dreary
journey
back
to
america
made
of
course
with
his
assistance
there
was
a
great
frankness
in
her
gratitude
a

miss
garland
lives
with
hudson
at
northampton
where
rowland
visits
his
cousin
cecilia
more
frequently
than
of
old
when
he
calls
upon
miss
garland
he
never
sees
hudson
cecilia
who
having
her
shrewd
impression
that
he
comes
to
see
miss
garland
as
much
as
to
see
herself
does
not
feel
obliged
to
seem
unduly
flattered
calls
him
whenever
he
reappears
the
most
restless
of
mortals
but
he
always
says
to
her
in
answer
no
i
assure
you
i
am
the
most
patient
