the
last
hushed
chord
died
into
silence
but
the
woman
lingered
dreaming
over
the
keys
firelight
from
the
end
of
the
room
brought
gold
gleams
into
the
dusky
softness
of
her
hair
and
shadowed
her
profile
upon
the
opposite
wall
no
answering
flash
of
jewels
met
the
questioning
light
there
was
only
a
mellow
glow
from
the
necklace
of
tourmalines
quaintly
set
that
lay
upon
the
white
lace
of
her
gown
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
fire
as
a
flower
seeks
the
sun
but
her
deep
eyes
looked
beyond
it
into
the
fires
of
life
itself
a
haunting
sense
of
unfulfilment
stirred
her
to
vague
resentment
and
she
sighed
as
she
rose
and
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
she
lighted
the
tall
candles
that
stood
upon
the
straightened
a
rug
moved
a
chair
and
gathered
up
a
handful
of
fallen
on
her
way
to
the
window
she
was
about
to
draw
down
the
shade
but
instead
her
hand
dropped
slowly
to
her
side
her
fingers
unclasped
and
the
crushed
crimson
petals
fluttered
to
the
floor
outside
the
purple
dusk
of
winter
twilight
lay
soft
upon
the
snow
through
an
opening
in
the
evergreens
the
far
horizon
grey
as
pearl
bent
down
to
touch
the
plain
in
a
misty
line
that
was
definite
yet
not
clear
at
the
left
were
the
mountains
cold
and
calm
veiled
by
distances
dim
with
frost
there
was
a
step
upon
the
stair
but
the
strong
straight
figure
in
white
lace
did
not
turn
away
from
the
window
even
when
the
door
opened
the
stillness
was
broken
only
by
the
cheerful
crackle
of
the
fire
until
a
sweet
voice
asked
are
you
dreaming
rose
rose
turned
away
from
the
window
then
with
a
laugh
why
i
must
have
been
will
you
have
this
chair
aunt
francesca
she
turned
a
rocker
toward
the
fire
and
madame
bernard
leaned
back
luxuriously
stretching
her
tiny
feet
to
the
blaze
she
wore
grey
satin
slippers
with
high
french
heels
and
silver
buckles
a
bit
of
grey
silk
stocking
was
visible
between
the
buckle
and
the
hem
of
her
grey
gown
rose
smiled
at
her
in
affectionate
appreciation
the
little
old
lady
seemed
like
a
bit
of
dresden
china
she
was
so
dainty
and
so
frail
her
hair
was
lustreless
snowy
white
and
beautifully
though
simply
dressed
in
a
bygone
fashion
her
blue
eyes
were
so
deep
in
colour
as
to
seem
almost
purple
in
certain
lights
and
the
years
had
been
kind
to
her
leaving
few
lines
her
hands
resting
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
had
not
lost
their
youthful
contour
but
around
her
eyes
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
the
faint
prints
of
many
smiles
rose
said
madame
bernard
suddenly
you
are
very
lovely
i
was
thinking
the
same
of
you
responded
the
younger
woman
flushing
shall
we
organise
ourselves
into
a
mutual
admiration
society
we
might
as
well
i
think
there
seems
to
be
nobody
else
a
shadow
crossed
rose
face
and
her
beauty
took
on
an
appealing
wistfulness
she
had
been
sheltered
always
and
she
hungered
for
life
as
the
sheltered
often
do
madame
bernard
for
the
thousandth
time
looked
at
her
curiously
from
the
shapely
foot
that
tapped
restlessly
on
the
rug
beneath
her
white
lace
gown
to
the
crown
of
dusky
hair
with
gold
lights
in
it
rose
was
made
for
love
and
madame
wondered
how
she
had
happened
to
miss
it
aunt
francesca
said
rose
with
a
whimsical
sadness
do
you
realise
that
i
forty
that
nothing
returned
the
other
serenely
everybody
has
been
forty
or
will
be
if
they
live
i
have
lived
yet
rose
objected
i
only
been
alive
there
life
there
hope
quoted
madame
lightly
what
do
you
want
dear
child
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
i
do
know
what
i
want
let
take
an
inventory
and
see
if
we
can
find
out
you
have
one
priceless
blessing
good
health
you
have
considerably
more
than
your
share
of
good
looks
likewise
a
suitable
wardrobe
not
many
clothes
but
few
and
those
few
good
clothes
are
supposed
to
please
and
satisfy
women
you
have
musical
talent
a
love
of
books
and
flowers
a
fine
appreciation
of
beauty
a
host
of
friends
and
that
one
supreme
gift
of
the
gods
a
sense
of
humour
in
addition
to
all
this
you
have
a
comfortable
home
and
an
income
of
your
own
that
enables
you
to
do
practically
as
you
please
could
you
ask
for
more
not
while
i
have
you
aunt
francesca
i
suppose
i
horrid
you
could
be
my
dear
i
left
marriage
out
of
the
question
since
if
you
had
any
deep
longing
for
it
you
have
chosen
some
one
from
the
horde
that
has
infested
my
house
for
fifteen
years
and
more
you
surely
been
loved
rose
smiled
and
bit
her
lip
i
think
that
it
she
murmured
never
cared
for
anybody
like
that
at
least
i
do
think
i
have
in
doubt
do
resumed
the
other
taking
refuge
in
a
platitude
is
there
any
one
of
that
faithful
procession
whom
you
particularly
regret
no
answered
rose
truthfully
love
is
like
a
vaccination
continued
the
little
lady
in
grey
with
seeming
irrelevance
when
it
takes
you
do
have
to
be
told
her
tone
was
light
almost
flippant
and
rose
in
her
turn
wondered
at
the
woman
and
her
marvellous
at
madame
bernard
married
a
young
french
soldier
who
had
chosen
to
serve
his
adopted
country
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
in
less
than
three
months
her
gallant
captain
was
brought
home
to
her
dead
for
a
long
time
she
hovered
uncertainly
between
life
and
death
then
one
day
she
sat
up
and
asked
for
a
mirror
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
looked
back
at
her
for
her
colour
was
gone
her
hair
was
quickly
turning
grey
and
the
light
had
vanished
from
her
eyes
yet
the
valiant
spirit
was
not
broken
and
that
day
with
high
resolve
she
sent
her
soul
forward
upon
the
new
way
he
was
a
soldier
she
said
and
i
his
wife
will
be
a
soldier
too
he
faced
death
bravely
and
i
shall
meet
life
with
as
much
courage
as
god
will
give
me
but
do
not
oh
do
not
even
speak
his
name
to
me
or
i
shall
forget
i
am
a
soldier
and
become
a
woman
again
so
gradually
it
became
understood
that
the
young
soldier
name
was
not
to
be
mentioned
to
his
widow
she
took
up
her
burden
and
went
on
devoting
herself
to
the
army
service
until
the
war
was
over
then
she
ceased
to
labour
with
lint
and
bandages
and
betook
herself
to
new
surroundings
her
husband
brother
offered
her
a
home
but
she
was
unable
to
accept
for
the
two
men
looked
so
much
alike
that
she
could
not
have
borne
it
sometimes
even
now
she
turned
away
in
pain
from
rose
who
resembled
her
father
man
poor
man
beggar
man
thief
madame
bernard
was
saying
i
seem
to
run
to
conversational
antiques
tonight
lawyer
merchant
chief
which
will
you
have
rose
if
i
remember
rightly
you
had
all
but
the
thief
already
shall
i
get
you
a
nice
embezzler
or
will
a
plain
burglar
do
neither
laughed
rose
i
safe
from
embezzlers
i
think
but
i
live
in
nightly
fear
of
being
burgled
as
you
well
know
none
the
less
we
got
to
take
the
risk
isabel
will
not
be
contented
with
you
and
me
she
want
other
hats
on
the
rack
besides
the
prehistoric
relic
we
keep
there
as
a
warning
to
burglars
i
forgotten
isabel
answered
rose
with
a
start
what
is
she
doing
dressing
for
dinner
my
dear
that
child
brought
three
trunks
with
her
and
i
understand
another
is
coming
she
has
enough
clothes
to
set
up
a
modest
shop
should
she
desire
to
into
trade
as
the
english
say
i
forgotten
isabel
said
rose
again
we
must
find
some
callow
youths
to
amuse
her
a
girl
of
twenty
ca
appreciate
a
real
man
sometimes
a
girl
of
forty
ca
either
laughed
madame
with
a
sly
glance
at
rose
cheer
up
my
dear
i
nearing
seventy
and
i
assure
you
that
forty
is
really
very
young
it
scarcely
infantile
but
i
admit
that
i
young
comparatively
all
things
are
comparative
in
this
world
and
perhaps
you
and
isabel
with
your
attendant
swains
may
enable
me
to
forget
that
i
no
longer
young
even
comparatively
the
guest
came
in
somewhat
shyly
she
was
a
cousin
of
rose
on
the
mother
side
and
had
arrived
only
that
afternoon
on
a
visit
bless
us
said
madame
bernard
how
pretty
we
are
isabel
you
a
credit
to
the
establishment
isabel
smiled
a
little
cool
smile
she
was
almost
as
tall
as
rose
and
towered
far
above
the
little
lady
in
grey
who
offered
her
a
welcoming
hand
and
invited
her
to
sit
by
the
fire
isabel
gown
was
turquoise
blue
and
very
becoming
as
her
hair
and
eyes
were
dark
and
her
skin
was
fair
her
eyes
were
almost
black
and
very
brilliant
they
literally
sparkled
when
she
allowed
herself
to
become
interested
in
anything
i
not
late
am
i
she
asked
no
answered
rose
glancing
at
the
clock
it
ten
minutes
to
seven
i
could
find
my
things
it
was
like
dressing
in
a
dream
when
as
soon
as
you
find
something
you
want
you
immediately
lose
everything
else
i
know
laughed
rose
i
had
occasion
to
pack
a
myself
last
night
during
my
troubled
slumbers
a
large
yellow
cat
appeared
mysteriously
out
of
the
shadows
and
came
yawning
toward
the
fire
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
madame
grey
gown
and
blinked
isabel
drew
her
skirts
away
i
do
like
cats
she
said
there
are
cats
and
cats
remarked
madame
bernard
in
a
tone
of
gentle
rebuke
boffin
is
not
an
ordinary
cat
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
and
he
never
forgets
his
manners
i
wondered
sometimes
said
rose
whether
he
really
knows
everything
or
only
pretends
that
he
does
he
looks
very
wise
silence
and
reserve
will
give
anyone
a
reputation
for
wisdom
madame
responded
she
bent
down
to
stroke
the
yellow
head
but
though
boffin
gratefully
accepted
the
caress
he
did
not
condescend
to
purr
presently
he
stalked
away
into
the
shadows
waving
his
yellow
tail
what
a
lovely
room
this
is
observed
isabel
after
a
pause
it
comfortable
replied
madame
i
could
live
in
an
ugly
place
everything
in
the
room
spoke
eloquently
of
good
taste
from
the
toned
eastern
rug
at
the
hearth
to
the
pictures
upon
the
walls
there
was
not
a
false
note
anywhere
in
the
subtle
harmony
of
line
colour
and
fabric
it
was
the
sort
of
room
that
one
comes
back
to
after
long
absence
with
renewed
appreciation
i
love
old
mahogany
continued
isabel
i
suppose
you
had
this
a
long
long
time
no
it
new
to
me
i
mean
i
have
some
beautiful
old
french
mahogany
but
i
do
use
it
her
voice
was
very
low
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
she
compressed
her
lips
tightly
and
leaning
forward
vigorously
poked
the
fire
a
stream
of
sparks
went
up
the
chimney
and
quick
flames
leaped
to
follow
do
set
the
house
on
fire
aunt
francesca
cautioned
rose
the
dinner
gong
the
three
went
out
madame
bernard
a
little
ahead
and
the
two
younger
women
together
rose
sat
opposite
the
head
of
the
table
and
isabel
was
placed
at
madame
right
in
a
single
glance
the
guest
noted
that
the
table
was
perfectly
appointed
are
you
making
company
of
me
she
asked
not
at
all
smiled
madame
none
the
less
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
eating
and
dining
and
we
endeavour
to
dine
if
aunt
francesca
were
on
a
desert
island
said
rose
i
believe
she
would
make
a
grand
affair
of
her
solitary
dinner
and
have
her
coffee
in
the
morning
before
she
rolled
out
of
the
sand
the
little
old
lady
dimpled
with
pleasure
i
try
to
she
laughed
i
think
i
she
was
interrupted
by
a
little
exclamation
of
pleasure
from
rose
who
had
just
discovered
a
small
white
parcel
at
her
plate
she
was
untying
it
with
eager
fingers
while
her
colour
came
and
went
a
card
fluttered
out
face
upward
to
my
dear
rose
with
love
from
aunt
francesca
was
written
in
a
small
quaint
hand
it
was
a
single
magnificent
ruby
set
in
a
ring
which
exactly
fitted
rose
seldom
wore
rings
and
wondered
vaguely
how
aunt
francesca
knew
i
filled
a
finger
of
one
of
your
gloves
said
madame
as
though
she
had
read
the
thought
and
had
it
fitted
simple
was
it
oh
breathed
rose
it
beautiful
beyond
words
how
shall
i
ever
thank
you
wear
it
dear
i
so
glad
you
pleased
it
lovely
said
isabel
but
the
tone
was
cold
and
she
seemed
to
speak
with
an
effort
with
a
swift
little
stab
at
the
heart
rose
saw
that
the
girl
envied
her
the
gift
it
reconciles
me
to
my
years
rose
went
on
quickly
i
willing
to
be
forty
if
i
can
have
a
ring
like
this
why
cousin
rose
cried
isabel
in
astonishment
are
you
forty
yes
dear
do
be
conventional
and
tell
me
i
do
look
it
for
i
feel
it
every
year
i
should
never
have
thought
it
isabel
murmured
rose
turned
the
ring
slowly
upon
her
finger
and
the
ruby
yielded
the
deep
crimson
glow
of
its
heart
to
the
candlelight
that
softly
filled
the
room
i
never
had
a
ruby
she
said
and
yet
i
feel
someway
as
though
i
always
had
this
it
seems
as
if
it
belonged
to
me
that
because
it
suits
you
nodded
madame
bernard
i
hope
that
sometime
our
civilisation
may
reach
such
a
point
of
advancement
that
every
woman
will
wear
the
clothes
and
jewels
that
suit
her
personality
and
make
her
home
a
proper
setting
for
herself
see
how
women
break
their
hearts
for
diamonds
and
not
one
woman
in
a
hundred
can
wear
them
could
i
wear
diamonds
asked
isabel
she
was
interested
now
and
her
eyes
sparkled
madame
bernard
studied
her
for
a
moment
before
replying
yes
she
admitted
you
could
wear
them
beautifully
but
they
do
not
belong
to
rose
or
to
me
what
else
could
i
wear
turquoises
if
they
were
set
in
silver
i
have
one
isabel
announced
with
satisfaction
a
lovely
big
turquoise
matrix
set
in
dull
silver
but
i
have
no
diamonds
they
come
rose
assured
her
if
you
want
them
i
think
people
usually
get
things
if
they
want
them
badly
enough
isabel
turned
to
madame
bernard
what
stones
do
you
wear
she
inquired
politely
only
amethysts
she
laughed
i
have
a
pearl
necklace
but
it
quite
so
i
do
wear
it
i
wo
wear
anything
that
how
can
you
tell
by
instinct
i
can
walk
into
a
shop
look
around
for
a
moment
and
say
bring
me
my
hat
the
one
i
ask
for
is
always
the
right
one
it
is
invariably
becoming
and
suitable
and
it
the
same
with
everything
else
it
a
wonderful
experience
to
go
shopping
with
aunt
francesca
put
in
rose
she
knows
what
she
wants
and
goes
straight
to
it
without
loss
of
time
utterly
regardless
of
fashion
for
its
own
sake
she
always
contrives
to
be
in
the
mode
though
i
believe
that
if
hoop
skirts
were
suited
to
her
she
have
the
courage
of
her
crinoline
and
wear
one
let
us
be
thankful
they
not
remarked
madame
it
almost
impossible
to
believe
it
but
they
must
have
looked
well
upon
some
women
every
personality
makes
its
own
demand
for
harmony
and
it
is
fascinating
to
me
to
observe
strange
people
and
plan
for
them
their
houses
and
clothes
and
belongings
you
can
pick
out
from
a
crowd
the
woman
who
would
have
a
crayon
portrait
of
herself
upon
an
easel
in
her
parlour
and
quite
properly
too
since
her
nature
demands
it
after
you
are
experienced
you
can
identify
the
man
who
eats
sugar
and
vinegar
on
lettuce
and
group
those
who
keep
parrots
or
are
capable
of
it
the
seventy
years
sat
lightly
upon
madame
francesca
now
her
deep
eyes
shone
with
inward
amusement
and
little
smiles
hovered
unexpectedly
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
a
faint
pink
tint
like
a
faded
rose
bloomed
upon
her
cheeks
rose
watched
her
with
adoring
eyes
and
wondered
whether
any
man
in
the
world
after
fifteen
years
of
close
association
could
be
half
so
delightful
coffee
was
brought
into
the
when
they
went
back
preceded
by
boffin
emanating
the
dignified
satisfaction
of
a
cat
who
has
supped
daintily
upon
chicken
and
cream
he
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
methodically
washed
his
face
i
believe
i
envy
boffin
his
perfect
digestion
remarked
madame
as
she
sipped
her
coffee
from
a
royal
canton
cup
she
and
rose
stood
for
half
an
hour
after
dinner
always
isabel
finished
her
coffee
and
set
the
cup
upon
the
table
she
slipped
the
sheffield
tray
from
under
the
embroidered
doily
and
took
it
to
the
light
where
she
leaned
over
it
studying
the
design
rose
thought
that
the
light
from
the
tray
was
reflected
upon
the
girl
face
she
became
at
once
so
brilliant
so
sparkling
speaking
of
harmony
said
madame
bernard
in
a
low
tone
glancing
at
rose
and
inclining
her
head
toward
isabel
yes
replied
isabel
returning
the
tray
to
its
place
it
is
a
lovely
one
is
it
madame
turned
toward
the
window
to
hide
a
smile
rose
followed
and
drew
the
little
grey
lady
into
the
circle
of
her
strong
arm
dear
aunt
francesca
she
said
softly
i
thank
you
so
much
the
older
woman
patted
the
hand
that
wore
the
ruby
then
turned
to
isabel
come
she
said
and
be
glad
you
indoors
the
three
women
stood
at
the
wide
window
looking
out
across
the
snow
lighted
only
by
the
stars
and
a
ghostly
crescent
of
moon
the
evergreens
were
huddled
closely
together
as
though
they
kept
each
other
warm
beyond
the
mountains
brooded
in
their
eternal
sleep
which
riving
lightnings
and
vast
reverberating
thunders
were
powerless
to
change
suddenly
across
the
purple
darkness
between
the
pale
stars
flamed
a
meteor
an
uncharted
voyager
through
infinite
seas
of
space
it
left
a
trail
of
fire
across
the
heavens
fading
at
last
into
luminous
mist
the
colour
of
the
stars
when
the
light
had
quite
died
out
madame
bernard
spoke
a
passing
soul
she
sighed
a
kiss
breathed
rose
dreamily
laughed
isabel
ii
welcome
home
great
news
my
dears
great
news
cried
madame
bernard
gaily
waving
an
open
letter
as
she
came
into
the
room
where
rose
was
sewing
and
isabel
experimenting
with
a
new
coiffure
i
give
you
three
guesses
somebody
coming
for
a
visit
asked
isabel
wrong
somebody
coming
but
not
for
a
visit
queried
rose
you
getting
warmer
how
can
anybody
come
if
not
for
a
visit
inquired
isabel
mildly
perplexed
that
is
unless
it
a
messenger
the
old
kent
house
is
to
be
opened
said
madame
and
we
to
open
it
at
last
we
shall
have
neighbours
how
exciting
rose
answered
she
did
not
wholly
share
the
old
pleasure
and
wondered
with
a
guilty
consciousness
of
the
long
hours
she
spent
at
her
music
whether
aunt
francesca
had
been
lonely
listen
girls
madame
cheeks
were
pink
with
excitement
as
she
sat
down
with
the
letter
which
had
been
written
in
paris
my
dear
madame
francesca
last
we
are
coming
home
allison
and
i
the
boy
has
a
fancy
to
see
spring
come
again
on
his
native
heath
so
we
shall
sail
earlier
than
we
had
otherwise
planned
wonder
my
dear
friend
if
i
dare
ask
you
to
open
the
house
for
us
i
am
so
tired
of
hotels
that
i
want
to
go
straight
back
you
have
the
keys
and
if
you
will
engage
the
proper
number
of
servants
and
see
that
the
place
is
made
habitable
i
shall
be
more
than
ever
your
debtor
i
will
cable
you
when
we
start
that
all
is
well
with
you
and
yours
and
with
many
thanks
believe
me
my
dear
madame
faithfully
yours
kent
how
like
a
man
smiled
rose
that
house
has
been
closed
for
over
ten
years
and
he
thinks
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
unlock
the
front
door
and
engage
two
or
three
servants
who
may
or
may
not
be
trustworthy
what
an
imposition
isabel
said
aunt
francesca
did
i
meet
allison
kent
when
i
was
here
before
i
forgotten
do
you
remember
mother
brought
me
here
once
when
i
was
a
little
tot
we
stayed
about
a
week
and
the
roses
were
all
in
bloom
i
can
see
the
garden
now
allison
used
to
come
over
sometimes
and
tell
me
fairy
stories
he
told
me
that
the
long
slender
bottles
filled
with
attar
of
roses
came
from
the
roots
of
the
rose
bushes
do
you
remember
and
i
pulled
up
rose
bushes
all
over
the
garden
to
find
out
dear
me
yes
smiled
aunt
francesca
how
time
does
fly
you
were
very
cross
with
allison
that
is
as
cross
as
you
ever
could
be
it
seemed
so
queer
for
you
to
be
angry
at
him
and
not
at
me
for
i
pulled
up
the
bushes
you
were
sufficiently
punished
isabel
i
believe
the
thorns
hurt
your
little
hands
did
they
they
certainly
did
responded
the
girl
with
a
little
shudder
at
the
recollection
i
have
a
scar
still
that
was
let
me
see
why
it
was
fifteen
years
ago
just
before
i
came
to
live
with
aunt
francesca
said
rose
you
and
your
mother
went
away
the
same
day
yes
we
went
in
the
morning
isabel
continued
and
you
were
to
come
in
the
afternoon
i
remember
pleading
with
my
mother
to
let
me
stay
long
enough
to
see
wose
fifteen
years
madame
repeated
allison
went
abroad
then
to
study
the
violin
and
the
house
has
been
open
only
once
since
richard
came
back
for
a
summer
to
attend
to
some
business
then
returned
to
europe
how
the
time
goes
by
the
letter
fell
to
the
floor
and
francesca
sat
dreaming
over
the
interlude
of
years
colonel
kent
had
been
her
husband
best
friend
and
after
the
pitiless
sword
had
cleaved
her
life
asunder
had
become
hers
at
forty
the
colonel
had
married
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
a
year
later
francesca
had
gone
to
him
with
streaming
eyes
carrying
his
born
son
in
her
arms
to
tell
him
that
his
wife
was
dead
drawn
together
by
sorrow
the
two
had
been
as
dear
to
each
other
as
friends
may
be
but
seldom
are
though
childless
herself
francesca
had
some
of
the
gifts
of
motherhood
and
at
every
step
she
had
aided
and
counselled
the
colonel
in
regard
to
his
son
who
had
his
mother
eyes
and
bore
his
mother
name
discerning
the
boy
talent
long
before
his
father
suspected
it
she
had
chosen
the
violin
for
him
rather
than
the
piano
and
had
herself
urged
the
colonel
to
take
him
abroad
for
study
though
the
thought
of
separation
caused
her
many
a
pang
when
the
two
sailed
away
francesca
had
found
her
heart
strangely
empty
her
busy
hands
strangely
idle
but
life
had
taught
her
one
great
lesson
and
when
one
door
of
her
heart
was
closed
she
opened
another
as
quickly
as
possible
so
she
sent
for
rose
who
was
alone
in
the
world
and
for
fifteen
years
the
two
women
had
lived
happily
together
as
she
sat
there
thinking
some
of
her
gay
courage
failed
her
for
the
moment
her
mask
was
off
and
in
the
merciless
sunlight
she
looked
old
and
worn
rose
looking
at
her
with
tender
pity
marvelled
at
the
ignorance
of
man
in
asking
a
frail
little
old
lady
to
open
and
make
habitable
in
less
than
a
fortnight
a
house
of
fifteen
large
rooms
aunt
francesca
she
said
let
me
open
the
house
tell
me
what
you
want
done
and
isabel
and
i
will
see
to
it
certainly
agreed
isabel
without
enthusiasm
we
do
it
no
madame
replied
stubbornly
he
asked
me
to
do
it
he
only
meant
for
you
to
direct
said
rose
you
surely
do
think
he
meant
you
to
do
the
scrubbing
madame
smiled
at
that
and
yielded
gracefully
there
must
be
infinite
scrubbing
after
all
these
years
i
believe
i
superintend
operations
from
here
then
when
it
all
done
i
go
over
and
welcome
them
home
that
is
as
it
should
be
isabel
and
i
will
go
over
this
afternoon
and
when
we
come
back
we
can
tell
you
all
about
it
you
better
drive
i
sure
the
paths
are
broken
so
after
luncheon
the
two
started
out
with
the
keys
madame
waving
them
a
cheery
from
the
window
everything
about
this
place
seems
queer
to
me
said
isabel
it
the
same
and
yet
not
the
same
i
know
rose
answered
things
are
much
smaller
are
they
yes
the
rooms
used
to
be
vast
and
the
ceilings
very
far
away
now
they
merely
large
rooms
with
the
ceilings
comfortably
high
the
garden
used
to
seem
like
a
huge
park
but
now
it
only
a
large
garden
there
used
to
be
a
great
many
steps
in
the
stairway
and
high
ones
at
that
now
it
nothing
compared
with
other
flights
only
aunt
francesca
remains
the
same
she
has
changed
at
all
she
a
saint
said
rose
with
deep
conviction
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
driveway
the
house
set
far
back
from
the
street
was
of
the
true
colonial
type
with
stately
white
pillars
at
the
dignified
entrance
the
garden
was
a
tangled
mass
of
undergrowth
in
spite
of
the
snow
one
could
see
that
but
the
house
being
substantially
built
had
changed
scarcely
at
all
a
new
coat
of
paint
will
freshen
it
up
amazingly
said
rose
as
they
went
up
the
steps
she
was
thrilled
with
a
mysterious
sense
of
adventure
which
the
younger
woman
did
not
share
i
feel
like
a
burglar
she
continued
putting
the
key
into
the
rusty
lock
i
feel
cold
remarked
isabel
shivering
in
her
furs
at
last
the
wide
door
swung
on
its
creaking
hinges
and
they
went
into
the
loneliness
and
misery
of
an
empty
house
the
dust
of
ages
had
settled
upon
everything
and
penetrated
every
nook
and
cranny
the
floors
groaned
dismally
and
the
scurrying
feet
of
mice
echoed
through
the
walls
cobwebs
draped
the
windows
where
the
secret
spinners
had
held
high
carnival
undisturbed
an
indescribable
musty
odour
almost
stifled
them
and
the
chill
dampness
carried
with
it
a
sense
of
gloom
and
foreboding
my
goodness
isabel
exclaimed
nobody
can
ever
live
here
again
do
be
discouraged
laughed
rose
soap
water
sunshine
and
fire
can
accomplish
miracles
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
black
empty
fireplace
yawned
cavernously
there
was
another
in
the
and
still
another
in
the
library
back
of
it
isabel
opened
the
door
on
the
left
why
there
another
fireplace
in
the
she
said
do
you
suppose
they
have
one
in
the
kitchen
too
go
in
and
see
if
you
like
i
afraid
to
go
alone
you
come
too
there
was
no
fireplace
in
the
kitchen
but
the
rusty
range
was
sadly
in
need
of
repair
i
going
down
cellar
rose
said
are
you
coming
i
should
say
not
hurry
back
wo
you
rose
went
cautiously
down
the
dark
narrow
stairway
the
light
was
dim
in
the
basement
but
she
could
see
that
there
was
no
coal
she
went
back
and
forth
several
times
from
bin
to
window
making
notes
in
a
small
memorandum
book
she
was
quite
determined
that
aunt
francesca
should
be
able
to
find
no
fault
with
her
housekeeping
when
she
went
back
there
were
no
signs
of
isabel
she
went
from
room
to
room
calling
then
concluded
that
she
had
gone
back
to
the
carriage
which
was
waiting
outside
rose
took
measurements
for
new
curtains
in
all
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
then
climbed
the
creaking
stairway
she
came
upon
isabel
in
the
upstairs
standing
absorbed
before
an
open
desk
in
her
hand
she
held
something
which
gleamed
brightly
even
in
the
gathering
shadow
isabel
she
cried
in
astonishment
the
girl
turned
and
came
forward
her
eyes
were
sparkling
look
there
a
secret
drawer
in
the
desk
and
i
found
this
in
it
i
love
secret
drawers
do
you
i
never
have
looked
for
them
in
other
people
houses
rose
answered
coldly
i
never
have
either
retorted
isabel
except
when
i
been
invited
to
clean
other
people
houses
there
was
something
so
incongruous
in
the
idea
of
isabel
cleaning
a
house
that
rose
laughed
and
the
awkward
moment
quickly
passed
look
said
isabel
again
rose
took
it
from
her
hand
a
lovely
miniature
framed
in
brilliants
a
sweet
face
was
pictured
upon
the
ivory
in
delicate
colours
that
of
a
girl
in
her
early
twenties
with
her
smooth
dark
hair
drawn
back
over
her
ears
a
scarf
of
real
lace
was
exquisitely
painted
upon
the
dark
background
of
her
gown
the
longing
eyes
held
rose
transfixed
for
an
instant
before
she
noted
the
wistful
childish
droop
of
the
mouth
the
girl
who
had
posed
for
the
miniature
if
she
had
been
truthfully
portrayed
had
not
had
all
that
she
asked
from
life
look
at
this
isabel
continued
she
offered
rose
a
bit
of
knitting
work
from
which
the
dust
of
years
fell
lightly
it
had
once
been
white
and
the
needles
were
still
there
grey
and
spotted
with
rust
rose
guessed
that
the
bit
had
been
intended
for
a
baby
shoe
but
never
finished
the
little
shoe
had
waited
all
those
years
for
hands
that
never
came
back
from
the
agony
in
which
they
wrung
themselves
to
death
in
the
room
beyond
the
infinite
pity
of
it
stirred
rose
to
quick
tears
but
isabel
was
unmoved
here
something
else
she
said
she
shook
the
dust
from
an
daguerreotype
case
then
opened
it
on
the
left
side
was
a
young
soldier
in
uniform
full
length
a
dashing
handsome
figure
with
one
hand
upon
a
drawn
sword
printed
in
faded
gilt
upon
the
dusty
red
satin
that
made
up
the
other
half
of
the
case
the
words
were
still
distinct
to
colonel
richard
kent
from
his
friend
jean
bernard
jean
bernard
isabel
repeated
curiously
who
was
he
aunt
francesca
husband
answered
rose
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
and
my
uncle
he
died
in
the
war
oh
said
isabel
unmoved
he
was
nice
looking
was
he
shall
we
take
this
to
aunt
francesca
you
forget
that
it
is
ours
to
take
rose
reminded
her
and
by
the
way
isabel
you
must
never
speak
to
aunt
francesca
of
her
husband
she
can
not
bear
it
all
right
assented
the
girl
what
is
this
from
the
back
of
the
drawer
she
took
out
a
bronze
medal
with
a
faded
ribbon
of
red
white
and
blue
attached
to
it
she
took
it
to
the
light
rubbed
it
with
her
handkerchief
and
slowly
made
out
the
words
awarded
to
colonel
richard
kent
for
conspicuous
bravery
in
action
at
gettysburg
put
the
things
back
rose
suggested
gently
this
tiny
secret
drawer
colonel
kent
holy
of
holies
symbolised
and
epitomised
the
best
of
a
man
life
the
medal
for
military
service
the
miniature
of
his
wife
the
picture
of
his
friend
and
the
bit
of
knitting
work
that
comprehended
a
world
of
love
and
anguish
and
bereavement
these
were
the
hidden
chambers
of
his
heart
isabel
took
up
the
miniature
again
before
she
closed
the
drawer
do
you
suppose
those
are
diamonds
no
only
brilliants
i
thought
so
if
they
been
diamonds
he
would
never
have
left
them
here
on
the
contrary
answered
rose
i
very
sure
he
would
she
had
met
colonel
kent
only
a
few
times
years
ago
during
the
summer
he
had
spent
at
home
while
allison
was
still
abroad
but
she
knew
him
now
nevertheless
they
went
on
through
the
house
making
notes
of
what
was
needed
while
their
footsteps
echoed
and
through
the
empty
rooms
i
glad
there
are
no
carpets
except
on
the
stairs
said
rose
for
rugs
are
much
easier
to
clean
it
resolves
itself
simply
into
three
c
coal
curtains
and
cleaning
it
wo
take
long
if
we
can
get
enough
people
to
work
at
it
it
was
almost
dusk
when
they
went
downstairs
but
the
cold
slanting
sunbeams
of
a
winter
afternoon
came
through
the
grimy
windows
and
illumined
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
open
fireplace
in
the
hall
motes
danced
in
the
beam
and
the
house
somehow
seemed
less
despairing
less
alone
a
portrait
of
colonel
kent
in
uniform
hung
above
the
great
mantel
rose
smiled
at
it
with
comprehension
but
the
painted
lips
did
not
answer
nor
the
unseeing
eyes
swerve
from
their
steady
searching
of
beyond
how
was
it
asked
madame
when
they
reached
home
dirty
and
bad
rather
soiled
admitted
rose
and
colder
than
greenland
isabel
continued
warming
her
hands
at
the
open
fire
we
soon
change
all
that
madame
said
i
ordered
coal
and
engaged
people
to
do
the
cleaning
since
you
been
gone
and
i
have
my
eye
upon
two
permanent
retainers
provided
their
references
are
satisfactory
i
measured
for
all
the
curtains
rose
went
on
shall
we
make
them
or
buy
them
we
make
them
if
we
have
help
enough
we
can
get
them
done
in
time
the
following
day
a
small
army
with
rose
at
the
head
of
it
took
possession
of
the
house
every
night
she
came
home
exhausted
not
from
actual
toil
but
from
the
effort
to
instill
the
pride
of
good
service
into
unwilling
workers
who
seemed
to
rejoice
in
ignorance
i
tired
rose
remarked
one
night
i
cerebrated
all
day
for
seven
bodies
besides
my
own
and
i
find
it
wearing
i
do
wonder
answered
madame
i
go
over
and
let
you
rest
indeed
you
wo
declared
rose
with
emphasis
i
begun
it
and
going
to
finish
it
unless
the
seven
weary
workers
fail
me
absolutely
at
last
the
task
was
completed
and
even
rose
could
find
no
speck
of
dust
in
the
entire
establishment
the
house
was
fresh
with
the
smell
of
and
floor
wax
and
so
warm
that
several
windows
had
to
be
kept
open
the
cablegram
had
come
while
the
curtains
were
being
made
but
everything
was
ready
two
days
before
the
wayfarers
could
possibly
reach
home
on
the
appointed
day
rose
and
isabel
were
almost
as
excited
as
madame
bernard
herself
she
had
chosen
to
go
over
alone
to
greet
the
colonel
and
his
son
they
were
expected
to
arrive
about
four
in
the
afternoon
at
three
madame
set
forth
in
her
carriage
she
wore
her
best
gown
of
lavender
crepe
trimmed
with
real
lace
and
a
bunch
of
heliotrope
at
her
belt
rose
had
twined
a
few
sprays
of
heliotrope
into
her
snowy
hair
and
a
large
amethyst
cross
hung
from
her
neck
by
a
slender
silver
chain
she
wore
no
other
jewels
except
her
wedding
ring
fires
blazed
cheerily
in
every
fireplace
on
the
lower
floor
and
there
was
another
in
the
upstairs
she
had
filled
the
house
with
the
flowers
of
spring
violets
daffodils
and
lilies
of
the
valley
a
silver
with
a
lamp
under
it
waited
on
the
library
table
when
she
heard
the
wheels
creaking
in
the
snowy
road
madame
lighted
the
lamp
under
the
kettle
with
her
own
hands
then
opened
the
door
wide
followed
by
their
baggage
the
two
men
came
up
the
walk
father
and
son
the
colonel
was
a
little
older
possibly
but
still
straight
and
tall
almost
as
tall
as
the
son
who
walked
beside
him
carrying
a
violin
case
under
his
arm
he
wore
the
familiar
slouch
hat
the
same
loose
overcoat
and
the
same
silvery
goatee
trimmed
most
carefully
his
blue
eyes
lighted
up
warmly
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
in
the
doorway
welcome
home
cried
madame
francesca
stretching
a
hand
toward
each
welcome
home
allison
only
smiled
taking
the
little
hand
in
his
strong
young
clasp
but
his
father
bent
hat
in
hand
to
kiss
the
one
she
offered
him
oh
cried
madame
i
so
glad
to
see
you
both
come
in
they
entered
their
own
hospitable
house
where
fires
blazed
and
the
kettle
sang
say
said
allison
is
this
great
why
did
we
ever
leave
it
is
it
fine
father
but
father
still
had
his
eyes
upon
the
dainty
little
lady
who
had
brought
forth
the
miracle
of
home
from
a
wilderness
of
dust
and
ashes
he
bent
again
over
the
small
white
hand
a
woman
a
fire
and
a
singing
kettle
he
said
all
the
dear
familiar
spirits
of
the
house
to
welcome
us
home
iii
the
voice
of
the
violin
madame
bernard
and
isabel
had
not
yet
come
down
when
rose
entered
the
half
an
hour
before
dinner
the
candles
were
lighted
and
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
reading
lamp
was
a
vase
of
pink
roses
sent
by
colonel
kent
to
his
old
friend
the
delicate
sweetness
filled
the
room
and
mingled
with
the
faint
scent
of
attar
of
roses
and
dried
rose
petals
which
as
always
hung
about
the
woman
who
stood
by
the
table
idly
rearranging
the
flowers
the
ruby
ring
caught
the
light
and
sent
tiny
crimson
gleams
dancing
into
the
far
shadows
her
crepe
gown
was
almost
the
colour
of
the
ruby
warm
and
it
was
cut
low
at
the
throat
and
an
old
oriental
necklace
of
wonderfully
wrought
gold
was
the
only
ornament
she
wore
aside
from
the
ring
the
low
light
gave
the
colour
of
the
gown
back
to
her
face
beautiful
as
always
and
in
her
dusky
hair
she
had
a
single
crimson
rose
aunt
francesca
had
said
that
the
colonel
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
house
and
glad
to
be
at
home
again
she
had
sent
over
her
own
cook
to
prepare
their
first
dinner
which
however
she
had
declined
to
share
contenting
herself
with
ordering
a
feast
suited
to
the
colonel
taste
they
were
to
dine
with
her
and
meet
the
other
members
of
her
household
madame
came
in
gowned
in
lustreless
white
with
heliotrope
at
her
belt
and
in
her
hair
she
wore
a
quaintly
wrought
necklace
of
amethysts
set
in
silver
and
silver
buckles
set
with
amethysts
on
her
white
shoes
more
than
once
rose
had
laughingly
accused
her
of
being
vain
of
her
feet
why
should
i
be
vain
she
had
retorted
in
they
pretty
of
course
they
are
smiled
rose
bending
down
to
kiss
her
the
prettiest
little
feet
in
all
the
world
madame
fancy
ran
seriously
to
shoes
and
stockings
of
which
she
had
a
marvellous
collection
silk
stockings
in
grey
and
white
and
in
all
shades
of
lavender
and
purple
embroidered
and
plain
with
shoes
to
match
in
satin
and
suede
occupied
a
goodly
space
in
her
wardrobe
at
and
on
her
birthday
rose
always
gave
her
more
for
it
was
the
one
gift
which
could
never
fail
to
please
how
lovely
the
house
is
said
madame
looking
around
appreciatively
i
hope
the
dinner
will
be
good
i
never
known
it
to
be
otherwise
rose
assured
her
am
i
all
right
is
my
skirt
even
you
are
absolutely
perfect
aunt
francesca
then
play
to
me
my
dear
if
my
outward
semblance
is
in
keeping
please
put
my
mind
into
a
holiday
mood
rose
ran
her
fingers
lightly
over
the
keys
what
shall
i
play
anything
with
a
tune
to
it
and
not
too
loud
smiling
rose
began
one
of
the
simple
melodies
that
aunt
francesca
loved
illustration
musical
notation
suddenly
she
turned
away
from
the
piano
her
elbow
falling
upon
the
keys
made
a
harsh
dissonance
isabel
my
dear
she
cried
are
you
almost
too
gorgeous
the
girl
stood
in
the
open
door
framed
like
a
portrait
against
the
dull
red
background
of
the
hall
her
gown
was
white
net
shot
and
spangled
with
silver
over
lustrous
white
silk
a
comb
of
filagree
silver
strikingly
lovely
in
her
dark
hair
was
her
only
ornament
except
a
large
turquoise
set
in
dull
silver
at
her
throat
i
not
overdressed
am
i
she
asked
with
an
eager
look
at
madame
not
if
it
suits
you
come
here
dear
isabel
obeyed
turning
around
slowly
for
inspection
almost
instantly
it
was
evident
that
madame
approved
so
did
rose
after
she
saw
how
the
gown
made
isabel
eyes
sparkle
and
brought
out
the
delicate
fairness
of
her
skin
you
do
suit
yourself
there
no
question
about
that
but
gorgeous
nevertheless
thus
rose
made
atonement
for
her
first
impulsive
speech
boffin
came
in
with
a
blue
ribbon
around
his
neck
and
helped
himself
to
aunt
francesca
chair
isabel
rocked
him
and
he
got
down
without
undue
haste
he
marched
over
to
a
chair
with
a
cushion
in
it
glared
at
isabel
for
a
moment
with
his
inscrutable
topaz
eyes
then
began
to
purr
the
clock
chimed
seven
silvery
notes
madame
bernard
waved
her
white
lace
fan
impatiently
it
the
psychological
moment
rose
observed
why
do
they
come
it
allison
fault
if
they
late
madame
assured
her
i
could
always
set
my
watch
by
the
colonel
he
there
what
did
i
tell
you
she
concluded
triumphantly
as
footsteps
sounded
outside
when
the
guests
were
ushered
in
madame
advanced
to
meet
them
the
firelight
had
brought
a
rosy
glow
to
her
lovely
face
and
her
deep
eyes
smiled
allison
put
his
violin
case
in
a
corner
before
he
spoke
to
her
did
you
really
asked
madame
how
kind
you
are
i
brought
it
laughed
the
young
man
just
because
you
did
ask
me
to
do
you
always
queried
rose
after
he
had
been
duly
presented
to
her
do
the
things
you
not
asked
to
do
invariably
he
replied
allison
said
madame
i
want
you
to
meet
my
niece
once
removed
miss
ross
the
colonel
had
already
bowed
to
isabel
and
was
renewing
his
old
acquaintance
with
rose
not
isabel
said
allison
in
astonishment
yes
answered
the
girl
her
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
isabel
why
little
playmate
how
did
you
ever
dare
to
grow
up
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
i
did
want
you
to
grow
up
he
objected
you
grown
up
some
yourself
she
retorted
i
suppose
i
have
he
sighed
what
a
pity
that
the
clock
wo
stand
still
yet
to
madame
he
did
not
seem
to
have
changed
much
he
was
taller
and
more
mature
in
every
way
of
course
she
noted
with
satisfaction
that
he
had
gained
control
of
his
hands
and
feet
but
he
had
the
same
boyish
face
the
same
square
chin
and
the
same
nice
brown
eyes
only
his
slender
nervous
hands
betrayed
the
violinist
well
are
you
pleased
with
me
he
asked
of
madame
his
eyes
twinkling
yes
she
answered
with
a
faint
flush
if
you
had
worn
long
hair
and
a
velvet
collar
i
should
never
have
forgiven
you
colonel
kent
laughed
outright
i
should
never
have
dared
to
bring
him
back
to
you
francesca
if
he
had
fallen
so
low
we
americans
and
please
god
we
stay
americans
wo
we
lad
you
bet
answered
allison
boyishly
going
over
to
salute
boffin
in
spite
of
all
temptations
to
belong
to
other
nations
i
an
he
sang
under
his
breath
through
the
mysterious
workings
of
some
sixth
sense
boffin
perceived
approaching
trouble
and
made
a
hurried
escape
will
you
look
at
that
asked
allison
with
a
hearty
laugh
i
even
touched
him
and
he
became
suspicious
of
me
as
i
remember
madame
said
my
cats
never
got
on
very
well
with
you
i
do
like
them
either
put
in
isabel
i
like
allison
said
i
like
a
whole
lot
but
it
mutual
and
i
never
could
understand
why
at
dinner
it
seemed
as
though
they
all
talked
at
once
madame
and
the
colonel
had
a
separate
conversation
of
their
own
while
allison
reminisced
with
isabel
as
he
said
and
asked
numerous
questions
of
rose
in
regard
to
the
neighbours
please
tell
me
he
said
what
has
become
of
the
crosby
twins
they
flourishing
rose
answered
you
do
mean
it
what
little
devils
they
were
are
corrected
rose
who
are
the
crosby
twins
inquired
isabel
they
probably
call
on
you
rose
replied
so
i
wo
spoil
it
by
endeavouring
to
describe
them
the
language
fails
to
do
them
justice
what
were
their
names
mused
allison
let
me
see
oh
yes
romeo
and
juliet
and
by
affectionate
abbreviation
to
each
other
rose
added
did
you
know
that
an
uncle
died
in
australia
and
left
them
a
small
fortune
no
i
did
what
are
they
doing
with
it
do
you
remember
when
you
were
a
child
how
you
used
to
plan
what
do
with
unlimited
wealth
allison
nodded
well
rose
resumed
that
just
what
they
doing
with
it
they
have
only
the
income
now
but
this
fall
when
they
come
into
possession
of
the
principal
i
prophesy
bankruptcy
in
five
years
even
so
he
smiled
they
doubtless
have
pleasant
memories
what
satisfaction
do
you
think
there
will
be
in
that
queried
isabel
i
ca
answer
just
now
allison
replied
but
the
minute
bankrupt
i
come
and
tell
you
it
likely
to
happen
to
me
at
any
time
meanwhile
colonel
kent
was
expressing
the
pleasure
he
had
found
in
his
household
was
it
very
much
trouble
francesca
none
at
all
to
me
you
always
were
wonderful
you
see
she
smiled
i
did
do
it
rose
did
everything
i
merely
went
over
at
the
last
to
arrange
the
flowers
make
the
tea
and
receive
the
credit
and
to
welcome
us
home
he
added
they
say
a
fireplace
is
the
heart
of
a
house
but
i
think
a
woman
is
the
soul
of
it
then
the
soul
of
it
was
there
waiting
was
it
but
only
for
a
little
while
he
sighed
i
am
very
lonely
sometimes
in
spite
of
the
boy
francesca
blue
eyes
became
misty
when
a
door
in
your
heart
is
closed
she
said
turn
the
key
and
go
away
opening
it
only
brings
pain
i
know
he
answered
clearing
his
throat
you
told
me
that
before
and
i
often
thought
of
it
yet
sometimes
it
seems
as
though
all
of
life
was
behind
that
door
ah
but
it
is
your
son
and
at
least
one
true
friend
are
outside
listen
no
allison
was
saying
i
got
well
acquainted
with
surprisingly
few
people
over
there
you
see
i
always
chummed
with
dad
bless
him
said
francesca
impulsively
have
i
done
well
asked
the
colonel
anxiously
it
was
hard
work
alone
indeed
you
have
done
well
i
hear
that
he
is
a
great
artist
he
more
than
that
he
a
man
he
clean
and
a
good
shot
and
he
is
afraid
of
anything
someway
to
me
a
man
who
played
the
fiddle
always
seemed
well
you
know
but
allison
is
no
answered
francesca
demurely
he
is
do
i
infer
that
it
is
a
disgrace
to
be
ladylike
not
for
a
woman
laughed
the
colonel
why
do
you
pretend
to
misunderstand
me
you
always
know
what
i
mean
after
dinner
when
the
coffee
had
been
served
allison
took
out
his
violin
of
his
own
accord
you
have
asked
me
to
play
but
i
going
to
who
is
going
to
play
my
accompaniment
do
all
speak
at
once
rose
went
to
the
piano
and
looked
over
his
music
i
try
fortunately
i
familiar
with
some
of
this
his
first
notes
came
with
a
clearness
and
authority
for
which
she
was
wholly
unprepared
she
followed
the
accompaniment
almost
perfectly
but
mechanically
lost
as
she
was
in
the
wonder
and
delight
of
his
playing
the
exquisite
harmony
seemed
to
be
the
inmost
soul
of
the
violin
speaking
at
last
through
forgotten
ages
of
things
made
with
the
world
love
and
death
and
parting
above
it
and
through
it
hovered
a
spirit
of
longing
infinite
and
untranslatable
yet
clear
as
some
high
call
subtly
rose
answered
to
it
in
some
mysterious
way
she
seemed
set
free
from
bondage
unsuspected
fetters
loosened
she
had
a
sense
of
largeness
of
freedom
which
she
had
never
known
before
she
was
quivering
in
an
ecstasy
of
emotion
when
the
last
chord
came
for
an
instant
there
was
silence
then
isabel
spoke
how
well
you
play
she
said
politely
i
ought
to
allison
replied
modestly
i
worked
hard
enough
how
long
have
you
been
studying
thirty
years
he
answered
that
is
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
at
work
all
my
life
how
funny
exclaimed
isabel
are
you
thirty
just
he
said
then
cousin
rose
and
i
are
like
steps
with
you
half
way
between
us
i
twenty
and
she
forty
smiled
isabel
with
childlike
frankness
rose
bit
her
lips
then
the
colour
flamed
into
her
face
yes
she
said
to
break
an
awkward
pause
i
forty
old
rose
she
added
with
a
forced
smile
nonsense
said
allison
quickly
how
can
a
rose
be
old
or
continued
the
colonel
with
an
air
of
gallantry
how
can
earth
itself
be
any
older
having
borne
so
fair
a
rose
upon
its
breast
for
forty
years
thank
you
both
responded
rose
her
high
colour
receding
shall
we
play
again
while
they
were
turning
over
the
music
madame
grappled
with
a
temptation
to
rebuke
isabel
then
and
there
not
fit
for
a
parlour
yet
she
thought
ought
to
be
in
the
nursery
on
a
bread
and
milk
diet
and
put
to
bed
at
six
for
her
part
isabel
dimly
discerned
that
she
had
said
something
awkward
and
felt
vaguely
uncomfortable
she
was
sorry
if
she
had
made
a
social
mistake
and
determined
to
apologise
afterward
though
she
disliked
apologies
allison
was
playing
again
differently
yet
in
the
same
way
through
the
violin
sounded
the
same
high
call
to
rose
life
assumed
a
new
breadth
and
value
as
from
a
newly
discovered
dimension
she
had
been
in
it
yet
not
of
it
until
now
she
was
merged
insensibly
with
something
vast
and
universal
finite
yet
infinite
unknown
and
an
hour
ago
she
was
quite
pale
when
they
finished
you
tired
he
said
sorry
i
not
she
denied
vigorously
but
you
are
he
insisted
do
you
suppose
i
can
see
his
eyes
met
hers
for
the
moment
clearly
and
once
more
she
answered
an
unspoken
summons
in
some
silent
way
the
room
turned
slowly
before
her
their
faces
became
white
spots
in
a
mist
you
play
well
allison
was
saying
i
wish
you
let
me
work
with
you
i
be
glad
to
rose
answered
with
lips
that
scarcely
moved
will
you
help
me
work
up
my
programs
for
next
season
indeed
i
will
do
stop
now
please
really
i
not
tired
while
she
was
still
protesting
he
led
her
away
from
the
piano
to
an
easy
chair
sit
there
he
said
and
i
do
the
work
those
accompaniments
are
heavy
he
went
back
to
his
violin
tightened
a
string
and
began
to
play
alone
the
melody
was
as
delicate
in
structure
as
the
instrument
itself
yet
strangely
full
of
longing
slowly
the
violin
gave
back
the
music
of
which
it
was
made
the
wind
in
the
forest
the
sound
of
many
waters
moonlight
shimmering
through
green
aisles
of
forest
the
mating
calls
of
spring
and
again
through
it
all
surged
some
great
question
to
which
rose
thrilled
in
unspoken
answer
a
great
prayer
which
in
some
secret
way
she
shared
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
when
she
felt
that
she
could
bear
no
more
what
is
it
she
forced
herself
to
ask
i
have
named
it
he
replied
putting
down
his
violin
is
is
it
yours
of
course
why
not
isabel
came
to
the
piano
and
took
up
the
violin
may
i
look
at
it
certainly
she
stroked
the
brown
breasts
curiously
and
twanged
the
strings
as
though
it
were
a
banjo
what
make
is
it
cremona
dad
gave
it
to
me
for
christmas
a
long
time
ago
it
belonged
to
an
old
man
who
died
of
a
broken
heart
what
broke
his
heart
queried
isabel
carelessly
one
of
his
hands
was
hurt
in
some
way
and
he
could
play
no
more
not
much
to
die
of
isabel
suggested
practically
ah
but
you
do
know
he
answered
shaking
his
head
francesca
had
leaned
forward
and
was
speaking
to
colonel
kent
in
a
low
tone
i
think
that
somewhere
in
the
house
not
made
with
hands
there
is
a
young
and
lovely
mother
who
is
very
proud
of
her
boy
the
colonel
fine
face
took
on
an
unwonted
tenderness
i
hope
so
she
left
me
a
sacred
trust
francesca
crossed
the
room
drew
the
young
man
tall
head
down
and
kissed
him
well
done
dear
your
adopted
mother
once
removed
is
fully
satisfied
with
you
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
being
vicariously
the
parent
of
a
great
artist
i
hope
you
do
consider
me
replied
allison
you
not
going
to
stop
me
are
you
i
could
was
her
smiling
assurance
i
got
the
habit
he
seemed
very
young
as
he
looked
down
at
her
she
loved
him
through
the
man
that
he
was
for
the
child
that
he
had
been
come
lad
the
colonel
suggested
it
getting
late
and
we
want
to
be
invited
again
allison
closed
his
violin
case
with
a
snap
said
to
aunt
francesca
then
went
over
to
rose
i
do
feel
like
calling
you
bernard
he
said
may
i
say
rose
as
we
rejoice
in
the
possession
of
the
same
aunt
surely
she
answered
colouring
faintly
then
cousin
rose
i
see
you
soon
again
and
we
begin
work
your
days
of
leisure
are
over
now
isabel
offered
him
a
small
cool
hand
her
eyes
were
brilliant
brought
out
by
the
sparkling
silver
of
her
gown
she
glittered
even
in
the
low
light
of
the
room
silver
girl
he
said
you
really
grown
up
after
all
when
the
door
closed
rose
gathered
up
the
music
he
had
forgotten
and
put
it
away
isabel
came
to
her
contritely
cousin
rose
i
so
sorry
i
said
that
i
did
think
do
bother
about
it
rose
replied
kindly
it
was
nothing
at
all
and
besides
it
true
the
truth
and
shame
the
family
misquoted
madame
bernard
age
and
false
hair
are
not
things
to
be
flaunted
isabel
remember
that
isabel
flushed
at
the
rebuke
and
her
cheeks
were
still
burning
when
she
went
to
her
room
i
do
care
she
said
to
herself
with
a
swift
change
of
mood
glad
i
told
him
they
never
have
done
it
and
it
just
as
well
for
him
to
know
madame
bernard
and
rose
soon
followed
her
example
but
rose
could
not
sleep
through
the
night
the
voice
of
the
violin
sounded
through
her
consciousness
calling
calling
calling
heedless
of
the
answer
that
thrilled
her
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
iv
the
crosby
twins
the
crosby
twins
were
making
a
formal
call
upon
isabel
they
had
been
skating
and
still
carried
their
skates
but
juliet
wore
white
gloves
and
had
pinned
her
unruly
hair
into
some
semblance
of
order
while
they
waited
at
the
door
she
wore
a
red
on
her
brown
curls
and
a
white
sweater
under
her
dark
green
skating
costume
which
was
short
enough
to
show
the
heavy
little
boots
just
now
filling
the
room
with
the
unpleasant
odour
of
damp
leather
wo
you
take
off
your
coat
asked
isabel
you
catch
cold
when
you
go
out
if
you
do
take
it
off
thanks
responded
juliet
somewhat
stiffly
then
she
stretched
out
both
hands
to
her
hostess
laughing
as
she
did
so
look
the
sweater
sleeves
had
crept
up
to
her
elbows
displaying
several
inches
of
bare
red
arm
between
the
sleeves
and
the
short
white
gloves
that
just
like
us
remarked
romeo
if
we
try
to
be
elegant
something
always
happens
the
twins
looked
very
much
alike
they
were
quite
tall
and
still
retained
the
dear
awkwardness
of
youth
in
spite
of
the
near
approach
of
their
birthday
they
had
light
brown
curly
hair
frank
blue
eyes
that
met
the
world
with
interest
and
delight
mouths
not
too
small
and
stubborn
little
chins
a
high
colour
bloomed
on
their
cheeks
and
they
fairly
radiated
the
joy
of
living
can
you
skate
inquired
romeo
no
smiled
isabel
juliet
can
she
can
skate
as
far
as
i
can
and
almost
as
fast
romie
taught
me
observed
juliet
with
becoming
modesty
do
you
play
hockey
no
of
course
you
do
if
you
do
skate
he
went
on
answering
his
own
question
can
you
swim
no
responded
isabel
sweetly
jule
a
fine
swimmer
she
saved
a
man
life
once
two
summers
ago
romie
taught
me
said
juliet
beaming
at
her
brother
can
you
row
he
asked
politely
no
replied
isabel
shortly
i
afraid
of
the
water
juliet
can
row
she
won
the
women
canoe
race
in
the
regatta
last
summer
the
prize
was
dollars
in
gold
romie
taught
me
put
in
juliet
we
teach
you
this
summer
said
romeo
with
a
frank
boyish
smile
that
showed
his
white
teeth
thank
you
responded
isabel
inwardly
vowing
that
they
would
juliet
can
do
most
everything
i
can
went
on
romeo
with
the
pardonable
pride
in
his
pupil
she
can
climb
a
tree
in
her
knickers
and
fish
and
skate
and
row
and
swim
and
fence
and
play
golf
and
tennis
and
shoot
and
dive
from
a
spring
board
and
she
can
ride
anything
that
has
four
legs
romeo
taught
me
chanted
juliet
in
a
voice
surprisingly
like
his
own
there
was
an
awkward
pause
then
romeo
turned
to
his
hostess
what
can
you
do
he
asked
meaning
to
be
deferential
isabel
thought
she
detected
a
faint
trace
of
sarcasm
so
her
answer
was
rather
tart
i
do
do
many
of
the
things
that
men
do
she
said
but
i
speak
french
and
german
i
can
sing
and
play
a
little
sew
and
embroider
and
trim
hats
if
i
want
to
and
paint
on
china
and
do
two
fancy
dances
and
when
i
go
back
home
i
going
to
learn
to
run
an
automobile
the
twins
looked
at
each
other
we
never
thought
of
it
said
juliet
much
crestfallen
wonder
how
much
they
cost
remarked
romeo
thoughtfully
where
can
you
buy
juliet
inquired
anywhere
in
town
i
suppose
so
isabel
assented
why
why
they
repeated
together
we
going
to
buy
one
and
learn
to
run
it
you
must
have
lots
of
money
said
isabel
enviously
loads
replied
romeo
with
the
air
of
a
plutocrat
more
than
we
can
spend
we
get
our
income
the
first
day
of
every
month
explained
juliet
and
put
it
into
the
bank
but
when
the
next
check
comes
there
always
some
left
they
seemed
to
consider
it
a
mild
personal
disgrace
why
do
you
save
it
queried
isabel
what
for
romeo
demanded
curiously
why
so
you
have
it
if
you
ever
need
it
it
keeps
right
on
coming
juliet
explained
pulling
down
her
sweater
uncle
died
in
australia
and
left
it
to
us
he
died
on
the
thirtieth
of
june
and
we
always
celebrate
why
do
you
celebrate
his
birthday
suggested
isabel
instead
of
the
day
he
died
his
birthday
was
no
good
to
us
replied
romeo
but
his
was
but
if
he
had
been
born
he
could
have
died
isabel
objected
more
or
less
logically
and
if
he
had
died
his
being
born
would
have
helped
us
any
replied
juliet
with
a
dazzling
smile
there
was
another
pause
will
you
have
some
tea
asked
isabel
with
rum
in
it
queried
juliet
i
do
think
so
said
isabel
doubtfully
aunt
francesca
never
does
we
do
either
romeo
explained
except
when
it
very
cold
and
then
only
a
teaspoonful
the
doctor
said
we
did
need
stimulants
what
was
it
he
said
we
needed
romie
sedatives
yes
that
was
it
sedatives
i
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
it
means
to
calm
or
to
moderate
i
think
he
got
the
word
wrong
himself
for
we
do
need
to
be
calmed
or
moderated
do
we
romie
i
should
say
not
the
twins
sipped
their
tea
in
silence
and
nibbled
daintily
at
wafers
from
the
cracker
jar
then
feeling
that
their
visit
was
over
they
rose
with
one
accord
we
had
a
dandy
time
said
juliet
crushing
isabel
hand
in
hers
bully
supplemented
romeo
come
and
see
us
i
will
isabel
responded
weakly
how
do
you
get
there
just
walk
up
the
main
road
and
turn
to
the
left
it
about
three
miles
three
miles
gasped
isabel
i
drive
out
just
so
you
come
romeo
said
graciously
it
an
awful
old
place
you
know
it
by
the
chimney
being
blown
over
and
some
of
the
bricks
lying
on
the
roof
juliet
turned
to
wave
her
hand
at
isabel
as
they
banged
the
gate
and
romeo
awkwardly
doffed
his
cap
their
hostess
went
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
had
the
sensation
of
having
quickly
closed
a
window
upon
a
brisk
march
wind
the
twins
set
their
faces
toward
home
the
walk
was
nothing
to
them
even
after
a
day
of
skating
the
frosty
air
nipped
cheeks
to
crimson
and
she
sniffed
at
it
with
keen
delight
it
nice
to
be
out
she
said
after
being
in
that
hot
house
what
do
you
think
of
her
romie
oh
i
do
know
he
replied
carelessly
say
how
did
she
have
her
hair
done
up
she
had
rats
in
it
and
it
was
curled
on
a
hot
iron
rats
what
in
thunder
is
or
are
that
or
they
little
wads
of
false
hair
made
into
cushiony
rolls
did
she
tell
you
no
laughed
juliet
do
you
suppose
i
can
see
a
rat
i
thought
rats
had
to
be
smelled
not
this
kind
she
smelled
of
something
kind
of
sweet
and
sticky
what
was
it
sachet
powder
i
guess
or
some
kind
of
perfume
i
liked
the
smell
can
we
get
some
i
guess
so
we
got
the
price
next
time
you
see
her
ask
her
what
it
is
will
you
all
right
answered
juliet
unperturbed
by
the
request
the
rest
of
the
way
was
enlivened
by
a
discussion
of
automobiles
romeo
had
a
hockey
match
on
for
the
following
day
which
was
saturday
so
they
were
compelled
to
postpone
their
investigations
until
monday
it
seemed
very
long
to
wait
it
no
good
now
anyhow
said
romeo
we
ca
run
it
until
the
roads
melt
and
dry
up
that
so
agreed
his
twin
despondently
why
did
she
tell
us
now
why
could
she
wait
until
we
had
some
chance
i
guess
we
can
learn
something
about
it
before
we
try
to
run
it
he
observed
cheerfully
if
we
can
get
it
into
the
barn
we
can
take
it
all
apart
and
see
how
it
put
together
oh
romie
cried
juliet
with
a
little
skip
how
perfectly
fascinating
and
we
read
all
the
automobile
literature
we
can
get
hold
of
i
do
so
love
to
be
posted
upon
the
death
of
their
father
several
years
ago
the
twins
had
promptly
ceased
to
go
to
school
the
kindly
old
minister
who
had
been
appointed
executor
of
their
father
small
estate
and
guardian
of
the
tumultuous
twins
had
been
unable
to
present
any
arguments
in
favour
of
systematic
education
which
appealed
to
them
even
slightly
what
good
is
latin
asked
romeo
apparently
athirst
for
information
why
er
mental
discipline
mostly
the
harassed
guardian
had
answered
is
there
anything
we
like
that
would
discipline
our
minds
queried
juliet
i
fear
not
replied
the
old
man
who
lacked
the
diplomacy
necessary
to
deal
with
the
twins
shortly
after
that
he
had
died
with
so
little
warning
that
he
had
only
time
to
make
out
a
check
in
their
favour
for
the
balance
entrusted
to
him
the
twins
had
held
high
carnival
until
the
money
was
almost
gone
the
bequest
from
the
australian
uncle
had
reached
them
just
in
time
so
with
thankful
hearts
they
celebrated
and
had
done
so
annually
ever
since
untrammelled
by
convention
and
restraint
they
thrived
like
weeds
in
their
ancestral
domicile
which
was
now
sadly
in
need
of
repair
occasionally
some
daring
prank
set
the
neighbourhood
by
the
ears
but
for
the
most
part
the
twins
behaved
very
well
and
attended
strictly
to
their
own
affairs
they
ate
when
they
were
hungry
slept
when
they
were
sleepy
and
if
they
desired
to
sit
up
until
four
in
the
morning
reading
they
did
so
a
woman
who
had
a
key
to
the
back
door
came
in
every
morning
at
an
uncertain
hour
to
wash
the
dishes
sweep
dust
and
to
make
the
beds
if
they
chanced
to
be
unoccupied
as
romeo
had
said
the
chimney
had
blown
down
and
several
loose
bricks
lay
upon
the
roof
they
had
a
small
vegetable
garden
fenced
in
and
an
itinerant
gardener
looked
after
it
in
summer
but
they
had
no
flowers
because
they
maintained
a
large
herd
of
stray
dogs
mostly
mongrels
that
would
have
had
no
home
had
it
not
been
for
the
hospitable
twins
romeo
bought
the
choicest
cuts
of
beef
for
them
and
fed
them
himself
occasionally
they
added
another
to
their
collection
and
at
the
last
census
had
nineteen
their
house
would
have
delighted
madame
bernard
it
was
so
eminently
harmonious
and
suitable
the
ragged
carpets
showed
the
floor
in
many
places
and
there
were
no
curtains
at
any
of
the
windows
romeo
cherished
a
masculine
distaste
for
curtains
and
juliet
did
not
trouble
herself
to
oppose
him
the
furniture
was
old
and
most
of
it
was
broken
the
large
easy
chair
in
the
sitting
room
was
almost
disembowelled
and
springs
showed
through
the
sofa
except
in
the
middle
where
there
was
a
cavernous
depression
several
really
fine
paintings
adorned
the
walls
and
the
dingy
mantel
was
glorified
by
exquisite
bits
of
cloisonne
and
iridescent
glass
for
which
juliet
had
a
pronounced
fancy
set
the
table
will
you
romie
called
juliet
tying
a
large
blue
gingham
apron
over
her
sweater
i
almost
starved
so
i
but
i
got
to
feed
the
dogs
first
let
wait
pleaded
juliet
please
do
do
be
so
selfish
they
worse
off
than
we
are
for
they
even
had
tea
while
the
pack
fought
outside
for
rib
bones
and
raw
steak
juliet
opened
a
can
of
salmon
fried
some
potatoes
put
a
clean
spoon
into
a
jar
of
jam
and
cut
a
loaf
of
bread
into
thick
slices
when
romeo
came
in
he
set
the
table
made
coffee
and
opened
a
can
of
condensed
milk
they
disdained
to
wash
dishes
but
cleared
off
the
table
after
supper
lighted
the
lamp
and
talked
automobile
until
almost
midnight
in
less
than
an
hour
romeo
had
completed
the
plans
for
remodelling
the
barn
they
had
no
horse
but
as
a
few
bits
of
harness
remained
from
the
last
equine
incumbent
they
usually
alluded
to
the
barn
as
the
bridle
chamber
we
have
to
name
the
barn
again
mused
juliet
and
we
can
name
the
automobile
too
wait
until
we
get
it
what
colour
shall
we
have
they
usually
red
or
black
are
they
she
asked
doubtfully
i
guess
so
we
want
ours
different
do
we
sure
we
want
something
that
nobody
ever
had
before
something
bright
and
cheerful
oh
romie
she
continued
jumping
up
and
down
in
excitement
let
have
it
bright
yellow
and
call
it
yellow
peril
her
twin
offered
her
a
friendly
hand
jule
he
said
solemnly
a
genius
we
have
brown
leather
inside
and
get
brown
clothes
to
match
brown
hats
with
yellow
bands
on
wo
it
be
perfectly
scrumptious
scrumptious
is
no
word
for
it
shall
we
have
two
seats
or
four
four
of
course
a
automobile
looks
terribly
selfish
stingy
too
murmured
romeo
and
we
can
afford
the
best
do
you
know
juliet
suggested
after
deep
thought
i
think
it
would
be
nice
of
us
if
we
waited
to
take
our
first
ride
until
we
celebrate
for
uncle
it
would
admitted
romeo
gloomily
but
it
such
a
long
time
to
wait
we
can
learn
to
run
it
here
in
the
yard
there
plenty
of
room
and
on
the
thirtieth
of
june
we
take
our
first
real
ride
in
it
be
a
sport
romie
she
urged
as
he
maintained
an
unhappy
silence
all
right
i
will
he
said
grudgingly
but
i
hope
uncle
appreciates
what
we
doing
for
him
that
settled
then
she
responded
cheerfully
then
on
our
second
ride
we
take
somebody
with
us
who
shall
we
invite
ought
she
to
go
with
us
the
first
time
she
who
miss
ross
isabel
she
suggested
it
you
know
we
might
not
have
thought
of
it
for
years
juliet
pondered
i
do
believe
she
ought
to
go
the
first
time
because
the
day
that
uncle
died
does
mean
anything
to
her
and
everything
to
us
but
we
take
her
on
the
second
trip
shall
i
write
to
her
now
and
invite
her
i
do
believe
romeo
responded
dryly
that
i
stop
to
write
an
invitation
to
somebody
to
go
out
four
months
from
now
in
an
automobile
that
is
bought
yet
but
it
as
good
as
bought
objected
juliet
because
our
minds
are
made
up
we
may
forget
to
ask
her
put
it
on
the
slate
suggested
romeo
in
the
hall
near
the
door
was
a
large
slate
suspended
by
a
wire
the
pencil
was
tied
to
it
here
they
put
down
vagrant
memoranda
and
things
they
planned
to
acquire
in
the
near
future
juliet
observed
that
there
was
only
one
entry
on
the
slate
military
hair
brushes
for
underneath
she
wrote
yellow
automobile
seated
name
it
yellow
peril
brown
leather
inside
get
brown
clothes
to
match
and
trim
with
yellow
first
ride
june
thirtieth
for
uncle
second
ride
july
first
for
ourselves
invite
isabel
ross
anything
else
she
asked
after
reading
it
aloud
dog
biscuit
yawned
romeo
they
eating
too
much
meat
it
was
very
late
when
they
went
their
rooms
were
across
the
hall
from
each
other
and
they
slept
with
the
doors
open
the
attic
had
been
made
into
a
gymnasium
where
they
exercised
and
hardened
their
muscles
when
the
weather
kept
them
indoors
a
trapeze
had
been
recently
put
up
and
juliet
was
learning
to
swing
by
her
feet
she
lifted
her
face
up
to
his
and
received
a
brotherly
peck
on
the
lips
jule
romie
pleasant
dreams
it
was
really
morning
but
there
was
no
clock
to
tell
them
so
for
the
timepieces
in
the
crosby
mansion
were
seldom
wound
say
called
romeo
what
what
do
you
think
of
her
who
miss
you
know
isabel
oh
i
do
know
responded
juliet
sleepily
i
guess
she
kind
of
a
v
an
afternoon
call
aunt
francesca
asked
isabel
is
colonel
kent
rich
very
responded
madame
she
had
a
fine
damask
napkin
stretched
upon
embroidery
hoops
and
was
darning
it
with
the
most
exquisite
of
stitches
then
why
do
they
live
in
a
better
house
and
have
more
servants
that
place
is
old
and
musty
perhaps
they
like
to
live
there
and
again
perhaps
they
enough
money
to
change
besides
that
has
been
colonel
kent
home
ever
since
he
was
married
allison
was
born
there
isabel
fidgeted
in
her
chair
if
they
very
rich
i
should
think
they
have
enough
money
to
enable
them
to
move
into
a
better
house
oh
replied
madame
carefully
cutting
her
thread
on
the
underside
i
was
thinking
of
money
when
i
spoke
i
do
know
anything
about
their
private
affairs
but
colonel
kent
has
courage
sincerity
an
fashioned
standard
of
honour
many
friends
and
a
son
who
is
a
great
artist
the
girl
was
silent
for
intangible
riches
did
not
appeal
to
her
strongly
allison
is
like
him
in
many
ways
madame
was
saying
he
is
like
his
mother
too
when
is
he
going
away
in
september
or
october
i
suppose
the
beginning
of
the
season
is
he
going
to
play
everywhere
everywhere
of
any
importance
perhaps
mused
isabel
he
will
make
a
great
deal
of
money
himself
perhaps
madame
responded
absently
i
do
hope
he
will
be
successful
she
had
almost
maternal
pride
in
her
foster
son
is
cousin
rose
going
too
going
where
what
do
you
mean
dear
why
nothing
only
i
heard
him
ask
her
if
she
would
go
with
him
on
his
concert
tour
and
play
his
accompaniments
providing
you
or
the
colonel
went
along
for
chaperone
and
cousin
rose
laughed
and
said
she
need
a
chaperone
that
she
was
old
enough
to
make
it
quite
respectable
and
suggested
madame
allison
laughed
too
and
said
if
they
are
going
said
madame
half
to
herself
and
decide
to
take
me
along
i
hope
they
give
me
sufficient
time
to
pack
things
decently
would
the
colonel
go
if
you
went
i
hardly
think
so
it
would
be
quite
so
proper
i
do
understand
remarked
isabel
wrinkling
her
pretty
brows
i
do
either
madame
replied
confidentially
however
i
lived
long
enough
to
learn
that
the
conventions
of
society
are
all
in
the
interests
of
morality
if
you
conventional
you
be
good
in
a
negative
sense
of
course
how
do
you
mean
aunt
francesca
perfect
manners
are
diametrically
opposed
to
crime
for
instance
it
is
very
bad
form
for
a
man
to
shoot
a
lady
or
even
to
write
another
name
on
a
check
and
cash
it
it
saves
trouble
to
be
conventional
for
you
not
always
explaining
things
most
of
the
startling
items
we
read
in
the
newspapers
are
serious
lapses
from
conventionality
and
good
manners
the
crosbys
are
very
conventional
isabel
suggested
no
smiled
madame
they
not
but
their
manners
proceed
from
the
most
kindly
and
friendly
instincts
consequently
they
seldom
in
error
essentially
they
have
lots
of
money
have
they
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
crosbys
had
more
than
their
age
and
social
training
fitted
them
to
use
wisely
but
i
never
known
them
to
go
far
astray
they
done
foolish
things
but
i
never
known
either
to
do
a
wrong
or
selfish
thing
money
is
a
terrible
test
of
character
but
i
think
the
twins
will
survive
it
i
suppose
they
done
lots
of
funny
things
with
it
madame
eyes
danced
and
little
smiles
wrinkled
the
corners
of
her
mouth
on
the
fourth
of
july
last
year
they
presented
every
orphan
in
the
orphans
home
with
two
dollars
worth
of
fireworks
carefully
chosen
of
course
the
inevitable
happened
and
the
orphans
managed
to
set
fire
to
the
home
but
after
two
hours
of
hard
work
the
place
was
saved
some
of
the
children
were
slightly
injured
during
the
celebration
but
that
did
matter
because
as
juliet
said
they
had
a
good
time
anyway
and
it
would
give
them
something
to
talk
about
in
years
to
come
it
would
have
been
better
to
spend
the
money
on
shoes
would
it
i
do
know
my
dear
the
finest
gift
in
the
world
is
pleasure
sometimes
i
think
it
better
to
feed
the
soul
and
let
the
body
fast
there
is
a
time
in
life
when
one
brief
can
produce
more
joy
than
ten
pairs
of
shoes
isabel
smiled
and
glanced
at
madame
bernard
lavender
satin
slipper
the
old
lady
laughed
and
the
soft
colour
came
into
her
pretty
face
i
frankly
admit
that
i
passed
it
she
said
better
one
pair
of
shoes
than
ten
if
the
shoes
are
the
sort
i
like
do
they
come
often
queried
isabel
reverting
to
the
subject
of
the
twins
not
as
often
as
i
like
to
have
them
but
it
does
do
to
urge
them
i
can
only
keep
my
windows
open
and
let
the
wind
from
the
clover
field
blow
in
as
it
will
do
they
live
near
a
clover
field
inquired
isabel
perplexed
no
but
they
remind
me
of
it
they
so
breezy
and
wholesome
so
free
and
untrammelled
and
at
heart
so
sweet
i
hope
they
come
again
soon
so
do
i
for
i
do
want
you
to
be
lonely
isabel
it
was
good
of
your
mother
to
let
you
come
mamma
does
care
what
i
do
observed
isabel
placidly
she
always
busy
madame
bernard
checked
the
sharp
retort
that
rose
to
her
lips
what
isabel
had
said
was
quite
true
ross
was
so
interested
in
what
she
called
the
new
thought
and
the
higher
world
service
that
she
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
for
the
old
thought
and
simple
service
that
make
and
keep
a
home
from
the
time
she
could
dress
herself
and
put
up
her
own
hair
isabel
had
been
left
much
to
herself
her
mother
supplied
her
liberally
with
money
for
clothes
and
considered
that
her
duty
to
her
daughter
ended
there
they
lived
in
an
apartment
hotel
and
had
their
coffee
served
in
their
rooms
in
the
morning
after
that
isabel
was
left
to
her
own
devices
for
committees
and
directors
meetings
without
number
claimed
her
mother
more
often
than
not
isabel
dined
alone
in
the
big
downstairs
and
spent
a
lonely
evening
with
a
novel
and
a
box
of
chocolates
on
pleasant
days
she
amused
herself
by
going
through
the
shops
and
to
the
matinee
she
did
not
make
friends
easily
and
the
splendid
isolation
common
to
hotels
and
desert
islands
left
her
stranded
socially
she
had
been
very
glad
to
accept
aunt
invitation
and
the
mother
looking
back
through
her
years
of
world
service
to
the
quiet
old
house
and
garden
had
thought
it
would
be
a
good
place
for
isabel
for
a
time
and
had
hoped
she
might
not
find
it
too
dull
to
endure
madame
bernard
had
no
patience
with
ross
when
she
had
come
for
a
brief
holiday
fifteen
years
before
bringing
her
child
with
her
she
had
just
begun
to
be
influenced
by
the
modern
feminine
unrest
later
she
had
definitely
allied
herself
with
those
whose
mission
it
is
to
emancipate
woman
with
a
capital
w
from
her
chains
forgetting
that
these
are
of
her
own
forging
and
anchor
her
to
the
eternal
verities
of
earth
and
heaven
a
single
swift
stroke
had
freed
ross
from
her
own
bondage
isabel
father
had
died
while
her
mother
was
out
upon
a
lecturing
tour
in
a
hotel
which
is
the
most
miserable
place
in
the
world
to
die
in
the
housekeeper
and
chambermaids
had
befriended
isabel
until
the
tour
came
to
its
triumphant
conclusion
ross
had
seemed
to
consider
the
whole
affair
a
kindly
and
appropriate
recognition
of
her
abilities
on
the
part
of
providence
she
attempted
to
fit
isabel
for
the
duties
of
a
private
secretary
but
failed
miserably
and
greatly
to
relief
gave
up
the
idea
madame
bernard
had
looked
forward
to
isabel
visit
with
a
certain
apprehension
remembering
ross
unbecoming
gowns
and
careless
coiffures
but
the
girl
passion
for
clothes
amounting
almost
to
a
complete
reversion
to
type
had
at
once
relieved
and
alarmed
her
if
i
can
strike
a
balance
for
her
she
had
said
to
herself
in
a
certain
midnight
musing
i
shall
do
very
well
as
yet
however
isabel
had
failed
to
balance
she
dressed
for
morning
and
luncheon
and
afternoon
and
again
for
dinner
changing
to
street
gowns
when
necessary
and
doing
her
hair
in
a
different
way
for
each
gown
still
as
rose
had
said
she
suited
herself
for
she
was
always
immaculate
beautifully
clad
and
a
joy
to
behold
madame
bernard
greatly
approved
of
the
lovely
white
wool
house
gown
isabel
was
wearing
she
had
no
fault
to
find
with
the
girl
taste
but
she
wished
to
subordinate
as
it
were
the
thing
to
the
spirit
the
temple
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made
isabel
smiled
at
her
sweetly
as
she
folded
up
her
work
a
little
uncomprehending
smile
are
you
going
away
now
for
your
winks
aunt
francesca
yes
my
dear
can
you
amuse
yourself
for
an
hour
or
so
without
playing
upon
the
piano
certainly
i
did
know
that
you
and
cousin
rose
were
asleep
yesterday
or
i
would
have
played
of
course
not
madame
leaned
over
her
and
stroked
the
dark
hair
waved
and
coiled
in
quite
the
latest
fashion
there
are
plenty
of
books
and
magazines
in
the
library
madame
went
upstairs
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
boffin
waving
his
plumed
tail
he
too
took
his
afternoon
nap
curled
up
cosily
upon
the
silken
quilt
at
the
foot
of
his
mistress
couch
in
the
room
adjoining
rose
rested
for
an
hour
also
though
she
usually
spent
the
time
with
a
book
left
to
herself
isabel
walked
back
and
forth
idly
greatly
allured
by
the
forbidden
piano
she
looked
over
carelessly
the
pile
of
violin
music
allison
had
left
there
some
of
the
sheets
were
torn
and
had
been
pasted
together
all
were
marked
in
pencil
with
hieroglyphics
and
most
of
them
were
stamped
in
purple
allison
kent
with
a
berlin
or
paris
address
written
in
below
isabel
had
met
very
few
men
in
the
course
of
her
twenty
years
for
this
reason
possibly
she
remembered
every
detail
of
the
two
weeks
she
had
spent
at
aunt
francesca
and
the
hours
with
allison
on
the
veranda
when
he
chose
to
amuse
himself
with
the
pretty
credulous
child
it
seemed
odd
to
have
him
coming
to
the
house
again
though
unless
he
came
to
dinner
he
usually
spent
the
time
playing
to
rose
accompaniment
she
had
not
seen
him
alone
she
surveyed
herself
in
the
long
mirror
and
was
well
pleased
with
the
image
of
youth
and
beauty
the
mirror
gave
back
the
bell
rang
and
she
pinned
up
a
stray
lock
carefully
it
was
probably
someone
to
see
aunt
francesca
but
there
was
a
pleasing
doubt
it
might
be
the
twins
though
she
had
not
returned
their
call
presently
allison
came
in
his
cheeks
glowing
from
his
long
walk
in
the
cold
silver
girl
he
smiled
where
are
the
spangles
and
are
you
alone
the
spangles
are
upstairs
waiting
for
candlelight
answered
isabel
as
he
took
her
small
cool
hand
and
i
very
much
alone
or
was
where
are
the
others
taking
naps
i
hope
i
have
tired
rose
out
said
allison
offering
isabel
a
chair
he
had
unconsciously
dropped
the
prefix
of
cousin
we
been
working
hard
lately
is
she
going
with
you
on
your
tour
i
do
know
i
wish
she
could
go
but
i
have
the
heart
to
drag
father
or
aunt
francesca
along
with
us
and
otherwise
it
would
be
well
unconventional
you
know
the
conventions
make
me
dead
tired
he
added
with
evident
sincerity
and
yet
said
isabel
looking
into
the
fire
they
are
all
in
the
interests
of
morality
if
you
conventional
you
be
good
negatively
it
is
good
manners
for
a
man
to
shoot
a
lady
or
to
sign
a
check
with
another
man
name
and
get
it
cashed
if
you
conventional
you
not
always
explaining
things
very
true
laughed
allison
but
sometimes
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
bears
heavily
upon
the
few
of
course
isabel
agreed
after
a
moment
pause
your
friends
the
crosby
twins
have
called
she
continued
really
allison
asked
with
interest
how
do
you
like
them
i
wish
they
come
often
she
smiled
they
remind
me
of
a
field
of
red
clover
they
so
breezy
and
so
wholesome
i
must
hunt
up
he
returned
absently
they
used
to
be
regular
little
devils
it
a
shame
for
them
to
have
all
that
money
why
because
they
waste
it
they
do
know
how
to
use
it
perhaps
they
do
in
a
way
one
fourth
of
july
they
gave
every
orphan
in
the
orphans
home
two
dollars
worth
of
fireworks
anybody
else
would
have
wasted
the
money
on
shoes
or
hats
i
see
you
have
grown
up
would
you
rather
have
fireworks
than
clothes
there
is
a
time
in
life
when
one
can
give
more
pleasure
than
a
pair
of
shoes
and
the
gift
of
pleasure
is
the
finest
gift
in
the
world
allison
was
agreeably
surprised
for
hitherto
isabel
conversation
had
consisted
mainly
of
monosyllables
and
platitudes
or
the
hesitating
echo
of
someone
else
opinion
now
he
perceived
that
it
was
shyness
that
isabel
had
a
mind
of
her
own
and
an
unusual
mind
at
that
he
looked
at
her
quickly
and
the
colour
bloomed
upon
her
pale
cold
face
tell
me
little
playmate
what
have
the
years
done
for
you
since
you
went
out
and
pulled
up
the
rose
bushes
to
find
the
scent
bottles
nothing
she
answered
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
still
looking
for
the
unattainable
yes
if
you
like
to
put
it
that
way
where
your
mother
out
lecturing
what
about
the
bloodless
revolution
or
the
gradual
emancipation
of
woman
she
repeated
her
work
must
keep
her
away
from
home
a
great
deal
he
ventured
after
a
pause
yes
i
seldom
see
her
you
must
be
lonely
she
turned
her
dark
eyes
to
his
i
live
in
a
hotel
she
said
in
the
simple
answer
allison
saw
an
unmeasured
loneliness
coupled
with
a
certain
loyalty
to
her
mother
he
changed
the
subject
you
like
it
here
do
you
yes
indeed
aunt
francesca
is
lovely
and
so
is
cousin
rose
i
wish
she
went
on
with
a
little
sigh
as
she
glanced
about
the
comfortable
room
that
i
could
always
stay
here
the
appeal
in
her
tone
set
allison
heart
to
beating
a
little
faster
i
wish
you
could
he
said
remorsefully
he
remembered
the
long
hours
he
had
spent
with
rose
at
the
piano
happily
oblivious
of
isabel
are
you
fond
of
music
he
asked
yes
indeed
i
always
sit
outside
and
listen
when
you
and
cousin
rose
play
come
in
whenever
you
want
to
he
responded
warmly
wo
i
be
in
the
way
wo
i
be
a
bother
i
should
say
not
how
could
you
be
then
isabel
smiled
i
come
sometimes
if
i
may
it
the
only
pleasure
i
have
that
too
bad
sometime
we
go
into
town
to
the
theatre
just
you
and
i
would
you
like
to
go
i
love
to
she
answered
eagerly
the
clock
ticked
industriously
the
fire
crackled
merrily
upon
the
hearth
and
the
wind
howled
outside
in
the
quiet
room
allison
sat
and
studied
isabel
with
the
firelight
shining
upon
her
face
and
her
white
gown
she
seemed
much
younger
than
her
years
you
only
a
child
he
said
aloud
a
little
helpless
child
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
before
i
grown
up
i
do
want
you
to
grow
up
i
can
remember
now
just
how
you
looked
the
day
i
told
you
about
the
scent
bottles
you
had
on
a
pink
dress
with
a
sash
to
match
pink
stockings
little
white
shoes
with
black
buttons
and
the
most
fetching
white
sunbonnet
your
hair
was
falling
in
curls
all
round
your
face
and
it
was
such
a
warm
day
that
the
curls
clung
to
your
neck
and
annoyed
you
you
toddled
over
to
me
and
said
please
fix
my
turls
do
you
remember
she
smiled
and
said
she
had
forgotten
but
she
added
truthfully
i
often
wondered
how
i
looked
when
i
was
dressed
up
then
he
continued
i
told
you
how
the
scent
bottles
grew
on
the
roots
of
the
rose
bushes
and
after
i
went
home
you
went
and
pulled
up
as
many
as
you
could
aunt
francesca
was
very
angry
with
me
yes
i
remember
that
i
felt
as
though
you
were
being
punished
for
my
sins
it
was
years
afterward
that
i
saw
i
been
sufficiently
punished
myself
look
she
leaned
toward
him
and
showed
him
a
narrow
white
line
on
the
soft
flesh
between
her
forefinger
and
her
thumb
extending
back
over
her
hand
a
thorn
she
said
i
shall
carry
the
scar
to
my
dying
day
with
a
little
catch
in
his
throat
allison
caught
the
little
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
forgive
me
he
said
vi
the
light
on
the
altar
colonel
kent
had
gone
away
on
a
short
business
trip
and
allison
was
spending
his
evenings
which
otherwise
would
have
been
lonely
at
madame
bernard
after
talking
for
a
time
with
aunt
francesca
and
isabel
it
seemed
natural
for
him
to
take
up
his
violin
and
suggest
if
only
by
a
glance
that
rose
should
go
to
the
piano
sometimes
they
played
for
their
own
pleasure
and
sometimes
worked
for
their
own
benefit
neither
madame
nor
isabel
minded
hearing
the
same
thing
a
dozen
times
or
more
in
the
course
of
an
evening
for
as
madame
said
with
a
twinkle
in
her
blue
eyes
it
made
a
pleasant
noise
and
isabel
did
not
trouble
herself
to
listen
both
rose
and
allison
were
among
the
fortunate
ones
who
find
joy
in
work
rose
was
so
keenly
interested
in
her
music
that
she
took
no
count
of
the
hours
spent
at
the
piano
and
allison
fully
appreciated
her
it
had
been
a
most
pleasant
surprise
for
him
to
find
a
good
accompanist
so
near
home
the
discouraging
emptiness
of
life
had
mysteriously
vanished
for
rose
her
restlessness
disappeared
as
though
by
magic
and
her
indefinite
hunger
had
been
in
some
way
appeased
she
had
unconsciously
emerged
from
one
state
into
another
as
the
tiny
dwellers
of
the
sea
cast
off
their
shells
she
had
a
sense
of
freedom
and
a
large
vision
as
of
dissonances
resolved
into
harmony
clothes
also
which
as
madame
had
said
are
supposed
to
please
and
satisfy
women
had
taken
to
themselves
a
new
significance
rose
had
made
herself
take
heed
of
her
clothes
but
she
had
never
had
much
real
interest
now
she
was
glad
of
the
time
she
had
spent
in
planning
her
gowns
merely
with
a
view
to
pleasing
aunt
francesca
she
wore
a
clinging
gown
of
deep
green
velvet
with
a
spray
of
green
leaves
in
her
hair
her
only
ornament
was
a
pin
of
jade
in
an
oriental
setting
allison
looked
at
her
admiringly
there
something
about
you
he
said
that
i
do
know
just
how
to
express
i
have
no
words
for
it
but
in
some
way
you
seem
to
live
up
to
your
name
how
so
rose
asked
demurely
well
i
never
seen
you
wear
anything
that
a
rose
might
not
wear
i
seen
you
in
red
and
green
and
yellow
and
pink
and
white
but
never
in
blue
or
purple
or
any
of
those
things
that
aunt
francesca
wears
that
only
means
answered
rose
flushing
that
blue
and
grey
and
tan
and
lavender
are
becoming
to
me
that
is
it
allison
insisted
for
you
be
lovely
in
anything
you
living
up
to
your
name
go
on
rose
suggested
mischievously
this
is
getting
interesting
you
need
laugh
i
assure
you
that
men
know
more
about
those
things
than
they
usually
given
credit
for
your
jewels
fit
in
with
the
whole
idea
too
that
jade
pin
for
instance
and
your
tourmaline
necklace
and
your
ruby
ring
and
the
topazes
you
wear
with
yellow
and
the
faint
scent
of
roses
that
always
hangs
about
you
what
else
she
smiled
well
i
had
a
note
from
you
the
other
day
it
was
fragrant
with
rose
petals
and
the
conventionalised
rose
in
gold
and
white
that
was
stamped
in
place
of
a
monogram
did
escape
me
besides
here
this
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
handkerchief
of
sheerest
linen
delicately
hemstitched
in
one
corner
was
embroidered
a
rose
in
palest
shades
of
pink
and
green
the
delicate
elusive
scent
filled
the
room
as
he
shook
it
out
there
he
continued
with
a
laugh
i
found
it
in
my
violin
case
the
other
day
i
do
know
how
it
came
there
but
it
was
much
the
same
as
finding
a
rose
twined
about
the
strings
aunt
francesca
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
by
the
fire
her
face
in
the
firelight
was
as
delicate
as
a
bit
of
carved
ivory
her
thoughts
were
far
away
one
could
see
that
isabel
sat
near
her
apparently
absorbed
in
a
book
but
in
reality
listening
to
every
word
i
wish
allison
was
saying
that
people
knew
how
to
live
up
to
themselves
that
an
awkward
phrase
but
i
do
know
of
anything
better
even
their
names
do
fit
and
they
get
nicknames
calls
me
william
murmured
rose
mother
calls
me
will
allison
went
on
that
it
exactly
see
how
the
are
adjusted
to
themselves
by
their
friends
some
are
and
more
of
are
who
is
allowed
to
wear
her
full
name
is
very
rare
i
glad
my
name
ca
be
changed
easily
she
said
thoughtfully
it
could
be
with
an
and
if
you
were
that
sort
it
would
be
take
aunt
francesca
for
instance
she
might
be
or
or
even
but
her
name
suits
her
so
she
gets
the
full
benefit
of
it
every
time
madame
turned
away
from
the
fire
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
been
away
upon
a
long
journey
did
i
hear
my
name
did
someone
speak
to
me
only
of
you
allison
explained
we
were
talking
of
names
and
nicknames
and
saying
that
yours
suited
you
if
it
did
observed
madame
bernard
i
change
it
when
we
get
civilised
i
believe
children
will
go
by
number
until
they
get
old
enough
to
choose
their
own
names
fancy
a
squirming
little
imp
with
a
terrible
temper
being
saddled
with
the
name
of
by
authority
of
church
and
state
except
to
his
doting
parents
he
never
be
anything
but
does
my
name
fit
me
queried
isabel
much
interested
it
would
said
allison
if
you
were
quite
so
tall
does
my
name
fit
me
he
spoke
to
madame
bernard
but
he
looked
at
rose
it
was
the
older
woman
who
answered
him
yes
of
course
it
does
how
dare
you
ask
me
that
when
i
named
you
myself
i
forgotten
allison
laughed
i
ca
remember
quite
that
far
back
they
began
to
play
once
more
and
isabel
pleading
a
headache
said
night
she
made
her
farewells
very
prettily
and
there
was
a
silence
after
the
door
closed
i
afraid
said
madame
that
our
little
girl
is
lonely
allison
ca
you
bestir
yourself
and
find
some
young
men
to
call
upon
her
i
ca
think
of
anybody
but
the
crosby
twins
what
the
matter
with
me
inquired
allison
lightly
am
i
not
calling
and
behold
i
give
her
a
headache
and
she
goes
to
bed
you
not
exactly
in
her
phase
of
youth
madame
objected
she
my
guest
and
she
has
to
be
entertained
i
willing
to
do
my
share
i
take
her
into
town
to
the
theatre
some
night
and
to
supper
afterward
in
the
most
brilliantly
lighted
place
i
can
find
that
very
nice
of
you
responded
rose
with
a
look
of
friendly
appreciation
i
know
she
would
enjoy
the
bright
lights
we
all
do
in
certain
moods
he
said
are
you
ready
now
the
voice
of
the
violin
rose
to
heights
of
ecstasy
sustained
by
full
chords
in
the
accompaniment
mingled
with
the
joy
of
it
like
a
breath
of
sadness
and
longing
was
a
theme
in
minor
full
of
question
and
heartbreak
of
appeal
that
was
almost
prayer
and
over
it
all
as
always
hovering
like
some
far
light
was
the
call
to
which
rose
answered
dumbly
she
knew
that
she
must
always
answer
it
though
she
were
dead
and
the
violin
itself
mingled
with
her
dust
madame
bernard
still
seated
by
the
fire
stirred
uneasily
something
had
come
into
her
house
that
vaguely
troubled
her
because
she
had
no
part
in
it
the
air
throbbed
with
something
vital
keen
alive
the
room
trembled
as
from
invisible
wings
imprisoned
old
dreams
and
memories
came
back
with
a
rush
and
the
little
old
lady
sitting
in
the
half
light
looked
strangely
broken
and
frail
the
sound
of
marching
and
the
steady
beat
of
a
drum
vibrated
through
her
consciousness
and
the
singing
violin
was
faint
and
far
she
saw
again
the
dusty
street
where
the
blue
column
went
forward
with
her
captain
at
the
head
his
face
stern
and
cold
grimly
set
to
some
high
purpose
that
meant
only
anguish
for
her
the
picture
above
the
mantel
seen
dimly
through
a
mist
typified
to
her
the
ways
of
men
and
women
since
the
world
began
the
young
knight
riding
forward
in
his
quest
for
the
grail
already
forgetting
what
lay
behind
while
the
woman
knelt
waiting
waiting
waiting
as
women
always
have
and
always
must
at
last
the
music
reached
its
end
in
a
low
chord
that
was
at
once
a
question
and
a
call
madame
rose
about
to
say
and
go
stairs
where
she
might
be
alone
on
the
instant
she
paused
her
heart
waited
almost
imperceptibly
then
resumed
its
beat
still
holding
the
violin
allison
was
looking
at
rose
subconsciously
madame
noted
his
tall
straight
figure
his
broad
shoulders
his
boyish
face
and
his
big
brown
eyes
but
rose
had
illumined
as
from
some
inward
light
her
lovely
face
was
transfigured
into
a
beauty
beyond
all
words
francesca
slipped
out
without
speaking
and
went
unheard
to
her
own
room
she
felt
guilty
because
she
had
discerned
something
of
which
rose
herself
was
as
yet
entirely
unconscious
with
the
instinctive
loyalty
that
distinguishes
fine
women
from
the
other
sort
madame
hoped
that
allison
did
not
know
and
so
she
said
to
herself
love
has
come
back
to
my
house
after
many
years
of
absence
i
wonder
if
he
cares
he
must
oh
he
must
francesca
had
no
selfish
thought
of
her
own
loneliness
if
her
rose
should
go
away
though
her
own
heart
was
forever
in
the
keeping
of
a
distant
grave
she
could
still
be
glad
of
another
joy
rose
turned
away
from
the
piano
and
allison
put
his
violin
into
the
case
it
late
he
said
regretfully
and
you
must
be
tired
perhaps
i
am
but
i
do
know
it
you
respond
so
fully
to
the
music
that
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
play
with
you
i
wish
i
could
always
have
you
as
my
accompanist
i
do
too
murmured
rose
turning
her
face
away
the
deep
colour
mounted
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
he
studied
her
impersonally
as
he
would
have
studied
any
other
lovely
thing
why
he
began
then
laughed
why
what
asked
rose
quickly
i
was
about
to
ask
you
a
very
foolish
question
do
hesitate
she
said
most
questions
are
foolish
this
is
worse
it
idiotic
i
was
going
to
ask
you
why
you
married
with
a
sharp
stab
at
the
heart
rose
noted
the
past
tense
why
you
she
queried
forcing
a
smile
there
is
only
one
answer
to
that
question
and
yet
people
keep
on
asking
it
they
might
as
well
ask
why
you
do
buy
an
automobile
well
continued
rose
inquiringly
because
not
impossible
she
or
has
come
that
all
perhaps
only
one
knows
she
suggested
no
replied
allison
in
any
true
mating
they
both
know
they
must
there
was
a
long
pause
a
smouldering
log
in
the
fireplace
broke
and
fell
into
the
embers
the
dying
flame
took
new
life
and
the
warm
glow
filled
the
room
is
that
why
people
do
buy
automobiles
queried
rose
chiefly
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
say
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
do
sounds
as
if
you
might
have
taken
it
from
alice
in
wonderland
she
commented
maybe
they
had
to
give
each
other
up
she
concluded
enigmatically
people
who
will
give
each
other
up
should
be
obliged
to
do
it
he
returned
may
i
leave
my
violin
here
i
be
coming
again
so
soon
surely
i
hope
you
will
he
took
her
hand
for
a
moment
in
his
warm
steady
clasp
and
subtly
rose
answered
to
the
man
not
the
violin
she
was
deathly
white
when
the
door
closed
and
she
trembled
all
the
way
when
she
saw
herself
in
the
mirror
she
was
startled
for
in
her
ghostly
pallor
her
deep
eyes
burned
like
stars
she
knew
now
the
woman
who
had
so
hungered
for
life
had
suddenly
come
face
to
face
with
its
utmost
wonder
its
highest
gift
of
joy
or
pain
the
heart
of
a
man
is
divided
into
many
compartments
mostly
isolated
sometimes
there
is
a
door
between
two
of
them
or
even
three
may
be
joined
but
usually
each
one
is
complete
in
itself
within
the
different
chambers
his
soul
sojourns
as
it
will
since
immeasurably
beyond
woman
he
possesses
the
power
of
detachment
of
intermittence
once
in
a
lifetime
possibly
under
the
influence
of
some
sweeping
passion
all
the
doors
are
flung
wide
and
the
one
beloved
woman
may
enter
in
yet
she
is
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
the
sphinx
if
she
refuses
to
go
let
her
say
to
him
close
all
these
doors
except
that
which
bears
my
name
in
that
chamber
and
in
that
alone
we
shall
dwell
together
for
with
these
words
the
memories
housed
in
the
other
chambers
crumble
to
dust
and
ashes
blown
only
by
vagrant
winds
of
fate
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
there
are
few
chambers
and
still
fewer
doors
instead
of
compartments
neatly
labelled
there
are
long
labyrinthine
passages
all
opening
into
one
another
and
inextricably
bound
together
to
shut
out
one
or
even
part
of
one
requires
the
building
of
a
wall
but
it
takes
a
long
time
and
the
barrier
is
never
firm
at
a
single
strain
of
music
the
scent
of
a
flower
or
even
one
glimpse
of
a
path
of
moonlight
lying
fair
upon
a
summer
sea
the
barriers
crumble
and
fall
through
the
long
corridors
the
ghosts
of
the
past
walk
unforbidden
hindered
only
by
broken
promises
dead
hopes
and
dust
even
while
the
petals
of
roses
rustle
through
the
winding
passages
where
the
windows
are
hung
with
cobwebs
greyed
at
last
from
iridescence
to
despairing
shadows
a
barrier
may
fall
at
the
sound
of
a
talismanic
name
for
the
hands
of
women
are
small
and
slow
to
build
and
the
hearts
of
women
are
tender
beyond
all
words
hidden
in
the
centre
of
the
labyrinth
is
one
small
secret
chamber
and
the
door
may
open
only
at
the
touch
of
one
other
hand
the
woman
herself
may
go
into
it
for
peace
and
sanctuary
when
the
world
goes
wrong
but
always
alone
until
the
great
day
comes
when
two
may
enter
it
together
as
theseus
carried
the
thread
of
ariadne
through
the
labyrinth
of
crete
there
are
many
who
attempt
to
find
the
secret
chamber
but
vainly
for
the
thread
will
always
break
in
the
wrong
heart
when
the
door
is
opened
at
last
by
the
one
who
has
made
his
way
through
the
devious
passages
there
is
so
little
to
be
seen
that
sometimes
even
the
man
himself
laughs
the
woman
to
scorn
and
despoils
her
of
her
few
treasures
the
secret
chamber
is
only
a
bare
white
room
where
is
erected
the
high
altar
of
her
soul
served
through
life
by
her
own
faith
upon
the
altar
burns
steadfastly
the
one
light
waiting
for
him
who
at
last
has
come
and
consecrated
in
his
name
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
is
and
heavy
and
he
who
has
not
the
key
may
beat
and
call
in
vain
while
within
unheeding
the
woman
guards
her
light
pitifully
often
the
man
does
not
care
sometimes
he
does
not
even
suspect
that
he
has
been
admitted
into
the
inmost
sanctuary
of
her
heart
for
there
are
men
who
may
never
know
what
sanctuary
means
nor
what
the
opening
of
the
door
has
cost
but
the
man
who
is
worthy
will
kneel
at
the
altar
for
a
moment
with
the
woman
beside
him
and
thereafter
when
the
outside
world
has
been
cruel
to
him
he
may
go
in
sometimes
with
her
to
warm
his
hands
at
those
divine
fires
and
kindle
his
failing
courage
anew
when
the
sanctuary
is
not
profaned
by
him
who
has
come
hither
its
blessedness
is
increased
it
takes
on
a
certain
divinity
by
being
shared
and
thereafter
they
serve
the
light
together
and
yet
through
woman
eager
trustfulness
the
man
who
opens
the
door
is
not
always
the
one
divinely
appointed
to
open
it
sometimes
the
light
fails
and
the
woman
weeping
in
the
darkness
is
left
alone
in
her
profaned
temple
never
to
open
its
door
again
or
after
many
years
to
set
another
light
high
upon
the
altar
and
in
the
deepening
shadows
pray
so
because
the
door
had
never
been
opened
and
because
she
knew
the
man
had
come
at
last
who
might
enter
the
sanctuary
with
her
rose
lifted
her
light
that
night
to
the
high
altar
of
her
soul
and
set
herself
to
wait
until
he
should
find
his
way
there
vii
father
and
son
the
house
seemed
very
quiet
though
steadily
from
a
distant
upper
room
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
for
more
than
an
hour
allison
had
worked
continuously
at
one
difficult
phrase
colonel
kent
smiled
whimsically
as
he
sat
in
the
library
thinking
that
by
this
time
he
could
almost
play
it
himself
looking
back
over
the
thirty
years
he
could
see
where
he
had
made
mistakes
in
moulding
the
human
clay
entrusted
to
his
care
yet
in
the
end
the
mistakes
had
not
mattered
back
in
the
beginning
he
had
formulated
certain
cherished
ideals
for
his
son
and
had
worked
steadily
toward
them
unmindful
of
occasional
difficulties
and
even
failures
against
his
own
judgment
he
had
yielded
to
francesca
in
the
choice
of
the
boy
career
look
at
his
hands
she
had
said
you
could
put
hands
like
his
at
work
in
an
office
if
he
is
meant
for
music
find
it
out
soon
enough
but
allison
had
gone
on
happily
along
the
chosen
path
with
never
a
question
or
doubt
of
his
ultimate
success
just
now
the
colonel
was
deeply
grateful
to
francesca
for
the
years
abroad
had
been
pleasant
ones
and
would
have
been
wholly
impossible
had
allison
been
working
in
an
office
with
a
sigh
he
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
through
the
hall
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
grey
head
bowed
before
him
was
his
own
portrait
in
uniform
his
hand
upon
his
sword
the
sword
itself
hanging
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
was
dull
and
lifeless
now
he
had
a
curious
sense
that
his
work
was
done
the
tiny
stream
rising
from
some
cool
pool
among
the
mountains
is
not
unlike
man
own
beginning
for
at
first
it
gives
no
hint
of
its
boundless
possibilities
grown
to
a
river
taking
to
itself
the
water
from
a
thousand
secret
channels
it
leaps
down
the
mountain
heedless
of
rocky
barriers
with
all
the
joy
of
lusty
youth
the
river
itself
portrays
humanity
precisely
with
its
tortuous
windings
its
accumulation
of
driftwood
its
unsuspected
depths
and
its
crystalline
shallows
singing
in
the
summer
sun
barriers
may
be
built
across
its
path
but
they
bring
only
power
as
the
conquering
of
an
obstacle
is
always
sure
to
do
sometimes
when
the
rocks
and
hills
loom
large
ahead
and
eternity
itself
would
be
needed
to
carve
a
passage
there
is
an
easy
way
around
the
discovery
of
it
makes
the
river
sing
with
gladness
and
turns
the
murmurous
deeps
to
living
water
bright
with
ripples
and
foam
ultimately
too
in
spite
of
rocks
and
driftwood
of
endless
seeking
for
a
path
of
tempestuous
nights
and
days
of
ice
and
snow
man
and
the
river
reach
the
eternal
sea
to
be
merged
forever
with
the
everlasting
upstairs
the
music
ceased
a
door
opened
then
closed
and
presently
allison
came
down
rubbing
his
hands
it
a
little
cool
up
there
he
said
and
yet
by
the
calendar
it
spring
i
wish
this
climate
could
be
averaged
up
even
then
we
would
be
satisfied
the
colonel
returned
who
wants
all
his
days
to
be
alike
nobody
still
it
a
bit
trying
to
freeze
your
nose
one
day
and
be
obliged
to
keep
all
the
windows
open
the
next
there
was
a
long
pause
the
colonel
tapped
his
fingers
restlessly
upon
the
library
table
allison
went
over
to
the
open
fire
and
stood
with
his
back
to
it
clasping
his
hands
behind
him
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
morning
dad
nothing
just
sitting
here
thinking
pretty
hopeless
occupation
unless
you
have
something
in
particular
to
think
about
it
better
to
have
nothing
to
think
about
than
to
be
obliged
to
think
of
something
unpleasant
is
it
i
do
know
allison
responded
smothering
a
yawn
almost
anything
is
better
than
being
bored
you
not
bored
are
you
asked
the
colonel
quickly
far
from
it
but
i
have
my
work
i
was
thinking
of
you
i
can
work
too
the
colonel
replied
i
think
as
soon
as
the
ground
thaws
out
i
make
a
garden
a
floral
catalogue
came
yesterday
and
the
pictures
are
very
inspiring
does
it
give
any
directions
for
distinguishing
between
the
flowers
and
weeds
no
laughed
the
colonel
but
i
thought
of
trying
the
ingenious
plan
of
the
man
who
pulled
up
the
plants
and
carefully
watered
the
weeds
expecting
the
usual
contrary
results
luncheon
was
announced
and
they
went
out
together
shivering
at
the
change
in
temperature
between
the
library
and
the
where
there
would
be
no
cheerful
open
fire
until
the
dinner
hour
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
queried
the
colonel
why
work
i
suppose
at
least
until
i
get
too
tired
to
work
any
more
you
seem
to
believe
in
an
day
something
in
the
tone
gave
allison
an
inkling
of
the
fact
that
his
father
was
lonely
and
restless
in
the
big
house
when
they
were
abroad
he
had
managed
to
occupy
himself
pleasantly
while
allison
was
busy
and
for
the
first
time
the
young
man
wondered
whether
it
had
been
wise
to
come
back
the
loneliness
of
the
great
rooms
was
evident
if
one
looked
for
it
and
the
silence
was
literally
to
be
felt
everywhere
it
is
difficult
for
two
people
to
be
happy
in
a
large
house
they
need
the
cosiness
established
by
walls
not
too
far
apart
ceilings
not
too
high
and
the
necessary
furniture
not
too
widely
separated
a
single
row
of
books
within
easy
reach
may
hint
of
companionship
not
possible
to
the
great
bookcase
across
a
large
room
i
think
said
allison
that
perhaps
this
house
is
too
large
for
us
why
should
we
need
fifteen
rooms
we
do
but
what
the
use
of
moving
again
just
now
when
we
all
settled
it
no
trouble
to
move
returned
the
young
man
it
might
be
if
we
did
it
ourselves
i
fancy
that
miss
rose
could
give
us
a
few
pointers
on
the
subject
of
opening
an
old
house
there
may
be
something
in
that
admitted
allison
what
charming
neighbours
they
are
he
added
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
madame
bernard
replied
the
colonel
with
emphasis
is
one
of
the
finest
women
i
have
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
miss
rose
is
like
her
but
i
have
known
only
one
other
of
the
same
sort
and
the
other
was
your
mother
the
colonel
pushed
back
his
plate
and
went
to
the
window
beyond
the
mountains
somewhere
in
god
acre
was
the
little
sunken
grave
still
enfolding
a
handful
of
sacred
dust
with
a
sudden
throb
of
pain
allison
realised
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
his
father
was
an
old
man
the
fine
strong
face
outlined
clearly
by
the
pitiless
afternoon
sun
was
deeply
lined
the
broad
shoulders
were
stooped
a
little
and
the
serene
eyes
dimmed
as
though
by
mist
in
the
moment
he
seemed
to
have
crossed
the
dividing
line
between
maturity
and
age
allison
was
about
to
suggest
that
they
take
a
walk
after
luncheon
having
madame
bernard
household
in
mind
as
the
ultimate
object
but
before
he
could
speak
the
colonel
had
turned
away
from
the
window
some
day
you
marry
lad
he
said
in
a
strange
tone
allison
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
doubtfully
and
then
the
colonel
continued
with
a
little
catch
in
his
voice
the
house
will
be
none
too
large
for
two
for
you
two
very
rarely
and
for
a
moment
only
allison
looked
like
his
mother
for
an
instant
she
lived
again
in
her
son
eyes
then
vanished
dad
he
said
gently
i
sure
you
would
desert
me
even
if
i
did
marry
you
stood
by
me
too
long
the
stooped
shoulders
straightened
and
the
colonel
smiled
do
you
mean
that
if
you
married
you
still
want
me
most
assuredly
she
would
if
she
did
returned
allison
lightly
she
would
get
me
not
that
i
any
prize
to
be
wrangled
over
by
the
fair
sex
individually
or
collectively
but
you
and
i
stand
together
dad
and
do
you
forget
it
the
colonel
cleared
his
throat
tried
to
speak
then
stopped
abruptly
i
have
been
thinking
he
continued
with
a
swift
change
of
mood
and
subject
that
we
might
manage
a
dinner
party
we
much
indebted
to
madame
bernard
good
idea
i
do
know
what
sort
of
party
it
would
prove
to
be
but
if
we
did
our
best
it
would
be
all
right
with
them
anyhow
aunt
francesca
would
give
an
air
to
it
so
would
the
others
miss
rose
especially
i
wonder
why
aunt
francesca
did
marry
again
mused
allison
because
her
heart
is
deep
enough
to
hold
a
grave
you
knew
her
husband
did
you
he
was
my
best
friend
answered
the
colonel
a
little
sadly
how
the
years
separate
and
destroy
and
blot
out
the
things
that
count
for
the
most
i
wonder
how
she
happened
to
be
named
it
is
an
american
name
she
was
her
name
was
frances
and
he
changed
it
to
francesca
so
she
has
been
francesca
ever
since
though
she
never
uses
the
that
was
his
name
for
her
the
change
suits
her
someway
queer
idea
she
has
about
names
fitting
people
and
yet
it
is
so
queer
either
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
rose
might
have
been
named
abigail
or
jerusha
yet
i
believe
people
would
have
found
out
she
was
like
a
rose
and
called
her
by
her
proper
name
colonel
kent
flashed
a
quick
glance
at
him
but
the
expression
of
his
face
had
not
changed
and
isabel
he
queried
lightly
isabel
only
a
kid
and
it
does
matter
so
much
whether
things
fit
her
or
not
i
promised
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
he
continued
irrelevantly
because
aunt
francesca
wants
her
guest
to
be
amused
also
commissioned
to
find
some
youths
about
twenty
and
trot
round
for
isabel
inspection
do
you
know
of
anybody
i
seen
only
one
who
might
do
there
a
lanky
boy
with
unruly
hair
and
an
expansive
smile
whom
i
seen
at
the
a
time
or
two
he
usually
has
a
girl
with
him
but
she
may
be
his
sister
they
look
astonishingly
alike
bet
it
the
crosby
twins
i
like
to
see
the
little
devils
if
they
grown
up
they
grown
up
whoever
they
are
the
boy
is
almost
as
tall
as
i
am
and
his
sister
does
lack
much
of
it
i
must
hunt
up
they
already
called
on
isabel
and
perhaps
when
she
returns
the
call
she
take
me
along
who
brought
them
up
asked
the
colonel
idly
they
brought
themselves
up
for
the
last
five
or
six
years
and
of
the
opinion
that
they
always
done
it
let
invite
them
to
the
dinner
party
allison
eyes
danced
at
the
suggestion
all
right
but
we
have
to
see
first
they
may
not
want
to
come
i
often
wondered
mused
the
colonel
why
it
is
so
much
more
pleasant
to
entertain
than
it
is
to
be
entertained
i
rather
have
a
guest
any
day
than
to
be
one
and
yet
returned
allison
if
you
are
a
guest
you
can
get
away
any
time
you
want
to
within
reasonable
limits
if
you
entertaining
you
got
to
keep
it
going
until
they
all
want
to
go
in
that
case
it
might
be
better
for
us
if
we
went
to
crosbys
we
can
do
that
too
i
think
it
would
be
fun
though
to
have
here
we
need
another
man
in
one
sense
though
not
in
another
i
have
frequently
had
occasion
to
observe
remarked
the
colonel
that
many
promising
dinners
are
wholly
spoiled
by
the
idea
that
there
must
be
an
equal
number
of
men
and
women
one
uncongenial
guest
can
ruin
a
dinner
more
easily
than
a
poor
salad
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
your
salad
days
are
over
yet
evidently
i
hope
not
the
hour
of
talk
had
done
the
colonel
a
great
deal
of
good
and
he
was
quite
himself
again
some
new
magazines
had
come
in
the
afternoon
mail
and
lay
on
the
library
table
he
fingered
the
paper
knife
absently
as
he
tore
off
the
outer
wrappings
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
i
believe
i
go
up
and
work
for
a
couple
of
hours
said
allison
and
then
we
go
out
for
a
walk
all
right
lad
i
be
ready
even
after
the
strains
of
the
violin
sounded
faintly
from
upstairs
accompanied
by
a
rhythmic
tread
as
allison
walked
to
and
fro
colonel
kent
did
not
begin
to
cut
the
leaves
instead
he
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
thinking
quite
unconsciously
for
years
he
had
been
carrying
a
heavy
burden
the
fear
that
allison
would
marry
and
that
his
marriage
would
bring
separation
now
he
was
greatly
reassured
and
yet
he
thought
there
no
telling
what
a
woman
may
do
the
sense
that
his
work
was
done
still
haunted
him
and
resolutely
he
tried
to
push
it
aside
while
there
life
there
work
he
said
to
himself
he
knew
however
as
he
had
not
known
before
that
allison
was
past
the
need
of
his
father
except
for
companionship
the
old
house
seemed
familiar
yet
as
though
it
belonged
to
another
life
he
remembered
the
building
of
it
when
with
a
girl
golden
head
upon
his
shoulder
they
had
studied
plans
together
far
into
the
night
as
though
it
were
yesterday
their
delight
at
the
real
beginning
came
back
there
was
another
radiant
hour
when
the
rough
flooring
for
the
first
story
was
laid
and
with
bare
scantlings
reared
all
around
them
they
actually
went
into
their
own
house
one
by
one
through
the
vanished
years
he
sought
out
the
links
that
bound
him
to
the
past
the
day
the
bride
came
home
from
the
honeymoon
and
knelt
with
him
upon
the
to
light
their
first
fire
together
the
day
she
came
to
him
smiling
to
whisper
to
him
the
secret
that
lay
beneath
her
heart
the
long
waiting
half
fearful
and
half
sweet
then
the
hours
of
terror
that
made
an
eternity
of
a
night
then
the
dawn
that
brought
the
ultimate
unbroken
peace
which
only
god
can
change
over
there
in
front
of
the
fireplace
in
the
library
the
little
mother
had
lain
in
her
last
sleep
the
heavy
scent
of
tuberoses
the
rumble
of
wheels
the
slow
sound
of
many
feet
and
the
tiny
wailing
cry
that
followed
them
when
he
and
she
went
out
of
their
house
together
for
the
last
time
it
all
came
back
but
mercifully
without
pain
were
it
not
for
this
divine
forgetting
few
of
us
could
bear
life
one
can
recall
only
the
fact
of
suffering
never
the
suffering
itself
when
a
sorrow
is
once
healed
it
leaves
only
a
tender
memory
to
come
back
perhaps
in
many
a
twilight
hour
with
tears
from
which
the
bitterness
has
been
distilled
slowly
too
by
the
wonderful
magic
of
the
years
unknown
joys
reveal
themselves
and
stand
before
us
as
though
risen
from
the
dead
at
such
and
such
a
time
we
were
happy
but
we
did
not
know
it
in
the
midst
of
sorrow
the
joy
comes
back
not
reproachfully
but
to
beckon
us
on
with
clearer
sight
to
those
which
lie
on
the
path
beyond
he
remembered
too
that
after
the
first
sharp
agony
of
bereavement
was
over
when
he
had
learned
that
even
death
does
not
deny
love
he
had
seemed
to
enter
some
mysterious
fellowship
gradually
he
became
aware
of
the
hidden
griefs
of
others
and
from
many
unsuspected
sources
came
consolation
even
those
whom
he
had
thought
hard
and
cold
cherished
some
holy
of
holies
some
sacred
altar
where
a
bruised
heart
had
been
healed
and
the
bitterness
taken
away
he
had
come
to
see
that
the
world
was
full
of
kindness
that
through
the
countless
masks
of
varying
personalities
all
hearts
beat
in
perfect
unison
and
that
joy
in
reality
is
immortal
while
pain
dies
in
a
day
and
yet
he
thought
how
strange
it
is
that
life
must
be
nearly
over
before
one
fully
learns
to
live
the
fire
crackled
cheerily
on
the
hearth
the
sunbeams
danced
gaily
through
the
old
house
spending
generously
in
corners
that
were
usually
dark
and
the
uncut
magazine
slipped
to
the
floor
above
the
violin
sang
high
and
clear
the
colonel
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
when
allison
came
down
he
was
asleep
with
the
peace
of
heaven
upon
his
face
and
so
quiet
that
the
young
man
leaned
over
him
a
little
frightened
to
wait
for
the
next
deep
breath
reassured
he
did
not
wake
him
but
went
for
his
walk
alone
viii
the
year
at
the
spring
outside
in
the
grey
darkness
the
earth
was
soft
with
snow
upon
the
illimitable
horizon
beyond
the
mountain
peaks
were
straying
gleams
of
dawn
colourless
but
none
the
less
surely
a
promise
of
daybreak
rose
had
been
awake
for
some
time
listening
to
the
branches
that
clattered
with
every
passing
breeze
a
maple
bough
tapping
on
her
window
as
ghostly
fingers
might
had
first
aroused
her
from
a
medley
of
dreams
she
went
to
the
window
shivering
a
little
and
while
she
stood
there
watching
the
faint
glow
in
the
east
the
wind
changed
in
quality
though
it
was
still
cool
hints
of
warmth
and
fragrance
were
indefinably
blended
with
the
cold
and
rose
laughed
as
she
crept
back
to
bed
for
she
had
chanced
upon
the
mysterious
hour
when
the
weaver
of
the
seasons
changed
the
pattern
upon
the
loom
having
raised
another
window
shade
she
could
see
the
dawn
from
where
she
lay
tints
of
gold
and
amethyst
came
slowly
upon
the
grey
and
made
the
horizon
delicately
iridescent
like
warm
and
soft
from
the
southland
the
first
wind
of
spring
danced
merrily
into
madame
francesca
sleeping
garden
thrilling
all
the
life
beneath
the
sod
with
the
first
beam
of
sun
the
ice
began
to
drip
from
the
imprisoned
trees
and
every
fibre
of
shrub
and
tree
to
quiver
with
aspiration
as
though
a
clod
should
suddenly
find
a
soul
in
the
watcher
heart
too
had
come
another
spring
for
once
in
time
and
tune
with
the
outer
world
the
heart
seasons
seldom
coincide
with
the
calendar
who
among
us
has
not
been
made
desolate
beyond
all
words
upon
some
golden
day
when
the
little
creatures
of
the
air
and
meadow
were
life
incarnate
from
sheer
joy
of
living
who
among
us
has
not
come
home
singing
when
the
streets
were
almost
impassable
with
snow
or
met
a
friend
with
a
happy
smiling
face
in
the
midst
of
a
pouring
rain
the
soul
too
has
its
own
hours
of
winter
and
spring
gethsemane
and
calvary
may
come
to
us
in
the
time
of
roses
and
easter
rise
upon
us
in
a
december
night
how
shall
we
know
in
our
own
agony
of
gladness
or
on
that
blessed
when
the
struggle
is
over
help
someone
else
to
bear
our
own
forgotten
pain
true
sympathy
is
possible
only
when
the
season
of
one
soul
accords
with
that
of
another
or
else
when
memory
divinely
tender
brings
back
a
vivid
scarlet
hour
out
of
grey
forgotten
days
to
enable
us
to
share
with
another
his
own
full
measure
of
sorrow
or
of
joy
ah
but
the
world
was
awake
at
last
across
a
field
of
melting
snow
went
a
flash
of
blue
wings
and
in
madame
francesca
own
garden
a
robin
piped
his
cheery
strain
upon
the
topmost
bough
of
a
dripping
tree
the
woman
too
was
awake
in
every
fibre
of
body
and
soul
even
her
seemed
sentient
and
alive
her
heart
was
strangely
lifted
as
though
by
imprisoned
wings
she
had
no
doubt
of
the
ultimate
hour
when
he
would
know
also
yet
she
shrank
from
it
as
she
would
not
have
shrunk
from
pain
madame
had
once
remarked
that
civilisation
must
have
begun
not
earlier
than
nine
in
the
morning
or
later
than
noon
she
had
a
horror
of
the
early
breakfast
when
the
family
cold
but
clean
gathers
itself
around
the
board
which
only
last
night
was
festive
and
strives
valiantly
to
be
pleasant
it
was
almost
an
axiom
with
her
that
human
friendly
conversation
was
not
possible
before
nine
in
the
morning
so
as
there
was
no
one
else
to
be
pleased
the
three
women
breakfasted
when
and
where
they
chose
if
rose
preferred
to
robe
herself
immaculately
in
white
linen
and
have
her
coffee
in
the
at
seven
she
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
if
she
wanted
it
in
her
own
room
at
ten
that
also
was
easily
managed
but
this
was
the
only
movable
feast
madame
would
permit
luncheon
and
dinner
went
precisely
by
tae
clock
year
in
and
year
out
too
happy
to
sleep
and
yearning
to
be
outdoors
rose
dressed
quietly
and
tiptoed
she
smiled
whimsically
as
the
heavy
front
door
slammed
behind
her
wondering
if
it
would
wake
the
others
and
if
they
too
would
know
that
it
was
spring
tips
of
green
showed
now
and
then
where
the
bulbs
were
planted
and
down
in
the
wild
garden
when
she
brushed
aside
the
snow
rose
found
a
blushing
hepatica
in
full
bloom
how
indiscreet
she
thought
then
added
to
herself
but
what
sublime
courage
it
must
take
to
blossom
now
the
plump
robin
whose
winter
had
evidently
been
pleasant
hopped
about
the
garden
after
her
occasionally
seeking
shelter
on
the
lower
bough
of
a
tree
if
she
turned
or
came
too
near
do
be
afraid
she
called
aloud
then
laughed
as
with
a
farewell
chirp
and
a
flutter
of
wings
the
robin
took
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
further
conversational
liberties
her
pulses
leaped
with
abundant
life
the
wet
road
lured
her
eager
feet
she
went
out
leaving
the
gate
open
and
turned
toward
the
woods
where
a
flock
of
wild
geese
breasting
the
chill
winds
far
above
the
river
was
steadily
cleaving
a
passage
to
the
friendly
north
when
she
reached
the
woods
where
the
white
birches
stood
like
shy
dryads
among
the
oaks
she
heard
once
more
the
robin
flutelike
call
it
was
answered
by
another
exactly
upon
the
same
notes
yet
wholly
different
as
to
quality
presently
among
the
trees
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
tall
man
and
she
paused
for
an
instant
frightened
then
her
heart
leaped
and
her
cheeks
burned
as
she
saw
who
it
was
boy
she
called
clearly
oh
boy
allison
turned
startled
then
came
to
her
smiling
hat
in
hand
upon
my
word
he
said
i
did
think
there
was
anyone
else
mad
enough
to
come
out
at
this
hour
why
it
spring
did
you
know
yes
it
came
this
morning
just
before
sunrise
were
you
awake
yes
were
you
of
course
she
answered
i
could
stay
in
nor
could
i
the
year
at
the
spring
and
day
at
the
morn
morning
at
seven
the
rose
quoted
you
know
the
rest
do
you
the
rest
does
matter
waits
at
the
end
of
the
world
gypsy
come
away
i
go
she
breathed
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
anywhere
to
the
river
then
the
last
time
i
saw
it
ice
and
snow
had
hidden
it
completely
the
path
was
narrow
until
they
got
out
of
the
woods
so
rose
went
ahead
i
do
believe
i
fooled
that
robin
by
whistling
to
him
allison
continued
he
pretended
i
did
but
i
believe
he
was
only
trying
to
be
polite
he
was
if
it
was
the
same
robin
i
saw
in
our
garden
this
morning
i
spoke
to
him
most
pleasantly
and
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
but
he
disappeared
with
a
very
brief
chirpy
do
hurry
so
he
said
as
he
came
up
beside
her
and
assisted
her
over
a
fallen
tree
we
got
the
whole
day
have
we
we
have
all
the
time
there
is
laughed
rose
everybody
has
for
that
matter
have
you
had
your
breakfast
no
have
you
far
from
it
everybody
was
asleep
when
i
came
out
then
you
have
breakfast
with
me
she
said
quickly
thank
you
he
smiled
for
taking
the
hint
but
wo
your
father
miss
you
she
queried
with
mock
seriousness
he
pays
no
attention
whatever
to
my
irregular
habits
and
i
think
that
one
reason
why
we
get
on
so
well
together
it
a
wise
father
who
knows
his
own
child
especially
if
it
is
a
wise
child
she
replied
her
eyes
were
dancing
with
mirth
a
scarlet
signal
burned
on
either
cheek
and
her
parted
lips
were
crimson
she
seemed
lovelier
to
him
than
ever
before
honestly
rose
you
seem
to
get
prettier
every
day
then
she
smiled
if
i
were
younger
i
might
eventually
become
dangerous
rose
old
rose
she
interrupted
the
high
colour
faded
from
her
face
as
she
spoke
and
left
her
pale
allison
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
and
stopped
rose
please
do
not
a
day
older
than
i
am
ten
years
she
insisted
stubbornly
for
women
are
wont
to
lean
upon
the
knife
that
stabs
them
and
she
was
in
a
reckless
mood
when
forty
i
be
fifty
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
it
hurts
me
someway
to
have
you
talk
so
i
do
know
how
nor
why
in
a
single
swift
surge
her
colour
came
back
all
right
she
answered
quietly
hereafter
i
thirty
also
thanking
you
for
giving
me
ten
more
years
of
life
for
i
love
it
so
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
heavens
when
they
came
to
the
river
and
the
dark
rippling
surface
gave
back
the
light
in
a
thousand
little
dancing
gleams
the
ice
was
broken
the
snow
was
gone
and
fragments
of
shattered
crystal
went
gently
toward
the
open
sea
lured
by
the
song
of
the
river
underneath
it
does
look
deep
remarked
rose
but
it
is
nevertheless
i
nearly
drowned
myself
here
when
i
was
a
kid
trying
to
dive
to
the
bottom
i
glad
you
did
succeed
what
a
heavy
blow
it
would
have
been
to
your
father
dear
old
dad
said
allison
gently
i
all
he
has
and
all
he
wants
it
after
eight
allison
complained
looking
at
his
watch
and
starving
so
am
i
likewise
my
skirts
are
wet
so
we
better
go
when
they
reached
madame
bernard
rose
ordered
breakfast
in
the
for
two
then
excused
herself
to
put
on
dry
clothing
allison
waited
before
the
open
fire
until
she
came
down
fresh
and
in
another
gown
and
a
white
linen
collar
i
thought
women
always
wore
soft
fluffy
things
in
the
morning
he
observed
as
they
sat
down
some
do
the
fluffy
ones
always
who
for
instance
are
the
fluffy
ones
aunt
francesca
for
one
and
isabel
for
another
how
long
is
the
kid
going
to
stay
until
she
gets
ready
to
go
home
i
suppose
i
thought
she
had
no
home
she
has
poor
isabel
is
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
woman
how
so
her
mother
is
emancipated
with
a
large
e
and
has
no
time
for
trifles
like
a
daughter
she
devotes
herself
to
what
she
calls
the
higher
world
service
so
isabel
is
stranded
on
a
desert
island
yes
except
for
us
how
good
you
are
he
exclaimed
with
honest
admiration
it
was
aunt
francesca
returned
rose
flushing
slightly
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
took
me
from
a
desert
island
too
is
isabel
emancipated
not
in
the
sense
that
her
mother
is
i
do
see
but
what
she
is
free
she
is
she
can
do
exactly
as
she
pleases
and
there
is
no
one
to
say
her
nay
i
thought
all
women
did
as
they
please
they
do
in
the
sense
that
we
all
do
as
we
please
if
you
make
a
sacrifice
you
do
it
because
you
can
get
more
pleasure
out
of
making
it
than
you
would
otherwise
you
been
reading
spencer
i
plead
guilty
she
laughed
if
it
true
he
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
a
genuine
new
england
conscience
must
be
an
unholy
joy
to
its
proud
possessor
it
unholy
at
all
events
one
lump
or
two
she
asked
as
the
coffee
was
brought
in
two
please
it
seemed
very
pleasant
to
allison
to
sit
there
in
the
warm
sunny
room
with
rose
opposite
him
pouring
his
coffee
there
was
an
air
of
cosiness
and
domestic
peace
about
it
hitherto
outside
his
experience
for
the
first
time
he
was
conscious
of
the
peculiar
graciousness
and
sense
of
home
that
only
a
woman
may
give
to
a
house
i
like
this
he
said
as
he
took
the
steaming
cup
i
like
to
do
it
often
we
like
to
have
you
she
returned
hospitably
i
thought
you
all
had
breakfast
together
at
some
fixed
hour
and
early
at
that
how
little
you
know
aunt
francesca
you
can
have
breakfast
in
this
house
in
any
room
you
choose
at
any
hour
before
noon
all
the
year
round
sometimes
we
all
together
sometimes
only
two
usually
however
i
alone
as
i
seem
to
get
up
a
little
earlier
than
the
others
i
think
i
drop
in
occasionally
then
it
looks
as
if
there
always
be
somebody
to
bear
me
company
perhaps
i
bring
dad
too
he
like
to
have
you
pour
his
coffee
there
was
no
mistaking
the
admiration
in
allison
eyes
and
rose
turned
hers
away
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
she
across
from
him
faced
it
squarely
for
the
merest
fraction
of
a
second
isabel
in
a
pink
silk
negligee
stood
in
the
doorway
then
vanished
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
her
eyes
were
full
of
mysterious
meaning
that
rose
was
powerless
to
translate
i
enjoy
it
rose
said
quickly
i
love
to
pour
the
coffee
and
aunt
francesca
always
lets
me
on
the
rare
occasions
when
we
breakfast
together
if
her
colour
was
a
little
brighter
if
her
voice
was
in
a
higher
key
if
her
eyes
had
changed
their
expression
allison
did
not
notice
it
yet
in
the
instant
she
had
attained
a
certain
dual
consciousness
there
seemed
to
be
two
of
her
one
was
the
woman
of
the
world
schooled
in
tactful
watchful
ready
to
smooth
any
awkwardness
and
at
every
point
to
guard
her
guest
the
other
was
primitive
woman
questioning
curious
and
watchful
in
the
sense
of
rivalry
she
put
it
resolutely
aside
to
think
about
later
and
was
very
glad
that
allison
did
not
know
she
was
greatly
relieved
when
he
went
home
promising
to
return
later
for
a
few
hours
of
work
upon
a
difficult
concerto
we
do
it
again
he
said
laughing
as
he
went
down
the
steps
ask
aunt
francesca
to
give
me
a
meal
ticket
to
be
used
solely
for
breakfasts
will
you
rose
only
smiled
in
answer
but
waved
her
hand
to
him
as
he
went
out
of
the
gate
she
stood
pensively
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
or
two
after
she
had
closed
the
door
and
would
have
gone
up
to
her
own
room
had
she
not
heard
a
step
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
isabel
was
coming
down
also
fresh
and
with
a
white
linen
collar
and
a
dashing
crimson
tie
rose
strolled
into
the
library
took
up
a
magazine
sat
down
and
pretended
to
read
i
so
sorry
to
be
late
to
breakfast
remarked
isabel
following
her
but
perhaps
it
just
as
well
as
i
was
invited
nobody
was
invited
returned
rose
coolly
i
went
out
for
an
early
walk
chanced
to
meet
kent
and
he
invited
himself
here
to
breakfast
i
did
know
you
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
early
walks
i
trying
to
acquire
the
habit
answered
rose
with
icy
sweetness
it
wo
be
hard
isabel
said
maliciously
if
they
all
equally
pleasant
she
slammed
the
door
as
she
went
out
shutting
rose
in
the
library
for
an
instant
rose
was
angry
then
her
sense
of
humour
triumphed
and
she
laughed
quietly
until
the
tears
came
there
was
no
need
now
to
meditate
upon
that
mysterious
look
in
the
girl
eyes
for
she
had
translated
it
herself
the
idea
said
rose
to
herself
that
foolish
little
child
she
tried
to
recall
the
conversation
at
the
breakfast
table
and
remembered
with
regret
that
they
had
discussed
isabel
quite
freely
the
thought
that
isabel
might
have
been
listening
before
she
made
her
presence
known
came
forward
persistently
though
rose
hated
herself
for
it
then
with
swift
resolution
she
put
all
annoying
thoughts
aside
to
dwell
happily
upon
the
perfect
hour
that
nothing
could
ever
change
or
spoil
she
went
into
the
hall
by
another
door
opening
out
of
the
library
thus
avoiding
isabel
and
sought
her
own
room
singing
to
herself
the
year
at
the
spring
and
day
at
the
morn
the
morning
at
seven
the
hillside
the
lark
on
the
wing
the
snail
on
the
thorn
god
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
ix
a
another
mongrel
had
been
added
to
the
crosby
collection
so
the
canine
herd
now
numbered
twenty
all
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
some
unpleasantness
had
been
caused
at
the
breakfast
table
by
a
gentle
hint
from
juliet
to
the
effect
that
the
dog
supply
seemed
somewhat
in
excess
of
the
demand
she
had
added
insult
to
injury
by
threatening
to
chloroform
the
next
dog
her
brother
brought
home
huh
romeo
sneered
they
as
much
yours
as
mine
you
brought
home
the
spotted
one
yourself
that
was
only
because
the
boys
were
teasing
him
i
did
want
him
i
never
brought
home
any
without
good
reasons
and
you
know
it
besides
we
got
room
here
for
forty
dogs
and
they
all
fenced
in
they
do
bother
anybody
except
by
barking
complained
juliet
they
do
bark
much
unless
somebody
goes
by
and
there
are
any
neighbours
near
enough
to
hear
even
then
they
do
bark
juliet
put
in
fretfully
they
bark
all
the
time
at
something
they
bark
when
they
hungry
and
when
they
eaten
too
much
and
they
bark
at
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
when
they
not
barking
some
or
all
of
are
fighting
they
drive
me
crazy
jule
said
romeo
sternly
i
do
see
what
the
matter
with
you
lately
you
act
like
a
sissy
girl
go
up
into
the
attic
and
work
on
the
trapeze
for
an
hour
or
two
and
you
feel
better
it
would
surprise
me
now
if
you
got
so
sissy
that
you
were
afraid
of
mice
and
snakes
juliet
anger
rose
to
the
point
of
tears
i
not
afraid
of
mice
she
sobbed
and
you
know
it
and
i
hold
a
little
green
snake
by
the
tail
just
as
long
as
you
will
so
there
romeo
hated
tears
shut
up
jule
he
said
not
unkindly
and
we
arbitrate
when
her
sobs
ceased
and
she
had
washed
her
face
in
cold
water
they
calmly
argued
the
question
at
issue
romeo
candidly
admitted
that
twenty
dogs
might
well
be
sufficient
for
people
of
simple
tastes
and
juliet
did
not
deny
that
only
a
sissy
girl
would
be
annoyed
by
barking
eventually
romeo
promised
not
to
bring
home
any
more
dogs
unless
the
present
supply
should
be
depleted
by
disappearance
or
accident
and
juliet
promised
not
to
chloroform
any
without
his
consent
with
one
accord
they
decided
to
fit
out
the
dogs
with
brown
leather
collars
trimmed
with
yellow
and
to
train
the
herd
to
follow
the
automobile
they
ought
to
be
trained
by
the
thirtieth
of
june
observed
romeo
it
would
make
more
of
a
celebration
for
uncle
if
we
took
along
did
you
order
the
monogram
put
on
the
automobile
sure
i
told
to
put
yellow
peril
on
each
door
and
on
the
back
and
the
initials
above
it
everywhere
the
twins
had
adopted
a
common
monogram
signifying
crosby
twins
it
adorned
their
stationery
and
their
seal
but
as
they
seldom
wrote
letters
it
had
not
been
of
much
use
we
might
have
the
initials
put
on
the
dogs
collars
too
juliet
suggested
sure
assented
romeo
cordially
then
if
we
lose
any
of
on
the
road
we
can
identify
when
they
found
and
get
back
juliet
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
and
hoped
romeo
would
forget
about
it
but
vainly
for
he
lounged
over
and
made
a
memorandum
on
the
slate
that
hung
in
the
hall
i
wonder
continued
romeo
thoughtfully
if
the
yard
is
big
enough
to
train
in
we
ought
not
to
go
out
on
the
road
until
the
thirtieth
that
easy
enough
juliet
answered
with
a
superior
air
how
you
go
about
it
he
demanded
if
they
were
my
dogs
and
i
wanted
to
follow
me
in
an
automobile
i
let
fast
for
a
day
or
two
and
fill
the
back
seat
of
the
machine
with
raw
meat
they
follow
quick
enough
and
be
good
and
lively
about
it
too
they
would
need
to
be
trained
jule
said
romeo
solemnly
will
you
please
forgive
me
for
calling
you
a
girl
sure
juliet
had
learned
long
before
she
was
twenty
that
forgive
me
from
a
man
lips
indicates
the
uttermost
depths
of
abasement
and
devotion
the
fasting
wo
hurt
romeo
continued
eager
to
change
the
subject
they
all
in
good
condition
now
except
the
last
one
you
can
see
some
of
his
ribs
yet
you
ca
by
june
no
i
guess
not
say
romie
ought
she
to
be
coming
to
see
us
by
now
who
isabel
you
know
up
at
bernard
comrade
though
she
was
juliet
had
a
secret
longing
for
feminine
association
at
rare
intervals
it
would
be
pleasant
she
thought
to
go
skating
sometimes
with
a
girl
or
two
instead
of
the
usual
crowd
of
boys
she
hated
herself
fiercely
for
disloyalty
but
the
idea
recurred
persistently
i
not
up
on
etiquette
romeo
replied
casually
but
i
should
think
if
she
wanted
to
come
she
could
do
it
by
now
we
made
a
polite
call
as
far
as
i
know
we
did
leave
any
cards
cards
what
kind
of
cards
why
little
cards
with
our
names
on
people
always
leave
in
the
books
when
they
make
calls
romeo
went
over
to
the
slate
again
and
made
another
memorandum
get
what
we
have
on
we
always
go
together
juliet
suggested
so
i
think
one
will
do
just
put
on
it
crosby
twins
with
our
address
no
need
of
the
address
everybody
who
knows
us
knows
where
we
live
perhaps
juliet
went
on
meditatively
she
does
like
me
if
she
does
romeo
retorted
i
know
the
reason
why
do
you
remember
what
i
did
to
the
boy
from
the
ridge
who
said
he
would
skate
with
the
crowd
if
there
was
a
girl
in
it
juliet
nodded
with
satisfaction
but
you
know
romie
you
ca
hit
a
girl
that
so
he
admitted
disconsolately
that
fresh
kid
had
to
wear
beefsteak
over
one
eye
for
almost
a
week
juliet
laughed
at
the
idea
of
isabel
with
beefsteak
bandaged
over
one
eye
we
wo
worry
about
things
we
ca
help
she
said
philosophically
we
done
the
proper
thing
and
now
it
up
to
her
if
she
does
come
before
we
get
the
automobile
she
does
get
invited
to
go
out
in
it
you
bet
she
does
the
talk
quickly
turned
to
the
unfailing
subject
of
automobiles
the
yellow
peril
had
been
ordered
and
half
paid
for
but
there
was
delay
in
delivery
the
brown
clothes
trimmed
with
tan
leather
had
also
been
ordered
as
well
as
the
brown
felt
hats
exactly
alike
with
yellow
ribbon
bands
they
had
the
goggles
and
enjoyed
glaring
fiercely
at
each
other
through
them
especially
at
meals
juliet
had
thought
of
making
a
veil
of
yellow
chiffon
but
romeo
had
objected
violently
he
thought
they
should
look
as
much
alike
as
possible
so
she
had
yielded
they
had
decided
to
make
a
wide
track
through
the
yard
and
around
the
barn
to
practise
on
suitable
space
for
the
automobile
had
already
been
set
aside
in
the
barn
and
safely
fenced
in
beyond
the
reach
of
canine
interference
romeo
had
not
seen
the
necessity
of
the
fence
until
juliet
had
pointed
out
that
some
of
the
dogs
would
want
to
sleep
on
the
leather
cushions
it
would
make
it
smell
so
doggy
she
had
said
that
have
to
call
it
yellow
dog
instead
of
yellow
peril
romeo
with
true
masculine
detachment
could
talk
automobile
with
unfailing
enthusiasm
and
yet
think
continually
about
something
else
the
thought
that
isabel
might
not
like
juliet
had
not
occurred
to
him
it
seemed
impossible
that
anybody
should
not
like
juliet
for
in
the
fond
eyes
of
her
twin
she
was
the
most
sane
and
sensible
girl
in
the
world
anyhow
thought
romeo
as
he
went
to
sleep
that
night
if
jule
wants
her
to
come
here
she
got
to
do
it
that
all
he
meditated
upon
the
problem
for
several
days
without
reaching
any
satisfactory
conclusion
at
last
he
determined
to
go
up
to
see
isabel
himself
and
as
he
phrased
it
in
his
own
mind
see
how
the
land
lays
it
would
be
difficult
to
elude
juliet
but
in
romeo
experience
the
things
one
determined
to
do
could
nearly
always
be
done
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
make
an
errand
to
the
city
to
poke
up
a
bit
about
the
machine
and
to
get
the
visiting
cards
which
had
promptly
been
ordered
by
mail
juliet
rather
insisted
upon
going
along
but
was
easily
dissuaded
by
the
fact
that
there
might
be
a
row
and
anyway
it
a
man
job
he
came
home
about
dusk
with
several
packages
one
of
which
he
carefully
concealed
under
a
pile
of
leaves
in
the
fence
corner
just
inside
the
yard
he
could
easily
reach
through
the
palings
and
lift
it
over
the
fence
as
he
passed
juliet
admired
the
cards
was
delighted
with
a
box
of
chocolates
and
two
new
novels
and
condescended
to
approve
of
romeo
new
red
tie
he
had
gloves
in
his
pocket
but
feared
to
show
them
to
her
gloves
being
her
pet
object
of
scorn
after
they
had
cleared
off
the
table
romeo
strolled
over
to
the
window
five
of
the
dogs
were
gathered
about
some
small
object
and
the
yard
was
littered
with
bits
of
white
under
his
breath
romeo
said
something
that
sounded
like
profanity
and
juliet
pricked
up
her
ears
what
the
matter
she
demanded
i
brought
home
some
flowers
explained
romeo
carefully
for
it
was
written
in
the
covenant
that
the
twins
should
never
under
any
circumstances
lie
to
each
other
and
i
must
have
dropped
the
dogs
have
torn
to
pieces
box
and
all
juliet
clapped
her
hands
gleefully
i
glad
of
it
why
he
asked
quickly
with
an
uneasy
sense
that
she
was
a
reader
because
we
got
so
many
dogs
romeo
chose
to
take
offence
at
the
innocent
remark
and
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
disdaining
to
speak
juliet
curled
up
on
the
decrepit
sofa
with
a
book
and
the
chocolates
and
presently
went
to
sleep
fortune
favours
the
brave
he
quoted
to
himself
as
he
tiptoed
into
the
kitchen
cautiously
closing
the
door
a
subtle
perfume
filled
the
room
and
he
sniffed
appreciatively
an
open
bottle
of
vanilla
extract
stood
on
the
kitchen
table
where
a
pan
of
fudges
was
cooling
marked
off
into
neat
squares
he
wrapped
the
pan
in
a
newspaper
anointed
his
handkerchief
liberally
with
the
fragrant
extract
and
softly
stole
out
into
the
night
the
dogs
followed
him
to
the
back
fence
but
did
not
bark
only
a
few
soft
whines
followed
him
as
he
sped
down
the
road
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
adventure
and
romance
if
juliet
should
happen
to
wake
she
would
think
he
had
gone
away
because
he
was
angry
and
never
need
know
that
like
some
misunderstood
knight
of
old
he
was
merely
upon
an
errand
of
chivalry
for
her
the
fudges
would
do
as
well
as
the
calla
lilies
probably
though
he
felt
instinctively
that
they
were
not
quite
as
elegant
it
was
a
long
way
to
madame
bernard
and
juliet
was
weary
after
an
exhausting
day
in
town
he
paused
outside
the
gate
long
enough
to
clean
the
dust
from
his
shoes
with
the
most
soiled
of
his
two
handkerchiefs
then
went
boldly
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
he
was
embarrassed
to
find
colonel
kent
and
allison
there
though
the
younger
man
tact
speedily
set
him
at
ease
again
and
enabled
him
to
offer
isabel
the
pan
of
fudges
with
unwonted
grace
of
manner
then
he
went
over
to
madame
bernard
juliet
could
come
he
said
but
here
our
card
madame
could
not
repress
a
smile
as
she
read
the
crosby
twins
engraved
in
the
fashionable
script
of
the
moment
how
very
original
she
said
kindly
nobody
but
you
and
juliet
would
have
thought
of
it
jule
thought
of
it
he
replied
with
evident
pride
she
more
up
on
etiquette
than
i
am
if
it
proper
for
husband
and
wife
to
have
their
names
engraved
on
the
same
card
madame
went
on
it
must
be
all
right
for
twins
it
more
proper
romeo
returned
because
nobody
is
so
much
related
as
twins
are
husband
and
wife
are
only
relatives
by
marriage
colonel
kent
laughed
appreciatively
good
may
i
have
some
of
miss
isabel
candy
isabel
convulsed
with
secret
mirth
informally
passed
the
pan
and
only
romeo
refused
i
can
have
any
time
he
said
generously
jule
make
dandy
fudges
though
everybody
agreed
that
she
did
madame
francesca
expressed
something
more
than
conventional
regret
that
juliet
had
not
been
able
to
come
she
was
asleep
romeo
explained
with
studied
indifference
after
she
wakes
suggested
colonel
kent
we
like
very
much
to
have
you
both
come
to
our
house
to
dinner
thank
you
replied
romeo
somewhat
stiffly
we
be
very
much
pleased
then
to
himself
he
added
that
was
a
lie
but
it
was
to
jule
so
it
does
matter
rose
made
friendly
inquiries
about
the
dogs
and
told
allison
that
romeo
was
said
to
have
the
finest
collection
of
fishing
tackle
in
the
state
much
gratified
romeo
invited
allison
to
go
fishing
with
him
as
soon
as
the
season
opened
and
as
an
afterthought
politely
included
the
colonel
i
never
been
fishing
remarked
isabel
as
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
girls
are
an
awful
bother
in
a
boat
romeo
returned
with
youthful
candour
that
is
except
juliet
isabel
flushed
faintly
and
bit
her
lips
to
relieve
an
awkward
pause
madame
francesca
asked
allison
to
play
something
yes
said
romeo
go
on
and
play
he
meant
to
be
particularly
courteous
but
his
tone
merely
indicated
that
he
would
not
be
seriously
annoyed
by
music
as
the
first
strains
came
from
the
piano
and
violin
romeo
established
himself
upon
the
couch
beside
isabel
and
in
a
low
guarded
tone
began
to
talk
automobile
isabel
was
so
much
interested
that
she
wholly
forgot
aunt
francesca
ideas
about
interrupting
a
player
and
the
conversation
became
animated
both
rose
and
allison
had
too
much
good
sense
to
be
annoyed
but
occasionally
until
the
last
chord
they
exchanged
glances
of
amusement
when
they
stopped
isabel
was
saying
your
suits
must
be
just
lovely
romeo
turned
with
a
lordly
wave
of
the
hand
you
do
need
to
stop
go
on
how
can
you
expect
us
to
play
properly
inquired
rose
tactfully
when
you
talking
about
automobiles
we
much
rather
listen
to
you
begin
over
again
wo
you
asked
allison
he
added
with
a
trace
of
sarcasm
wholly
lost
upon
romeo
we
missed
a
good
deal
of
it
thus
encouraged
romeo
began
again
thoughtfully
allowing
isabel
the
credit
of
the
original
suggestion
he
dwelt
at
length
upon
the
fine
points
involved
in
the
construction
of
the
yellow
peril
described
the
brown
leather
and
the
specially
designed
costumes
and
was
almost
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
when
he
pictured
the
triumphant
progress
of
the
yellow
car
followed
by
twenty
dogs
in
appropriate
collars
can
you
he
inquired
of
allison
think
of
anything
more
like
a
celebration
that
we
could
do
for
uncle
no
replied
allison
choking
back
a
laugh
unless
you
went
out
at
night
too
and
had
fireworks
romeo
expressive
face
indicated
displeasure
uncle
was
such
a
good
man
he
said
in
a
tone
of
quiet
rebuke
that
i
do
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
allison
coughed
and
colonel
kent
hastily
went
to
the
window
madame
hid
her
face
for
an
instant
behind
her
fan
and
isabel
laughed
openly
sure
he
was
said
rose
quickly
can
you
remember
him
at
all
no
romeo
responded
we
never
seen
him
but
he
was
a
brick
all
the
same
are
you
going
to
run
the
car
yourself
queried
rose
of
course
some
day
i
take
you
out
he
suggested
kindly
then
turned
to
isabel
and
played
his
highest
trump
juliet
said
something
about
asking
you
to
go
with
us
the
second
time
we
went
out
of
course
it
her
place
to
do
it
i
love
to
go
murmured
isabel
she
ask
you
when
you
come
out
to
return
her
call
romeo
continued
i
been
meaning
to
come
but
i
been
waiting
for
good
roads
when
you
come
he
answered
do
say
anything
about
my
having
been
here
it
might
make
her
feel
bad
to
think
i
went
out
calling
and
left
her
asleep
all
right
i
wo
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
without
obvious
effort
romeo
made
his
escape
after
shaking
hands
with
everyone
and
promising
to
come
again
very
soon
i
bring
jule
next
time
once
outside
he
ran
toward
home
like
a
hunted
wild
animal
hoping
with
all
his
heart
that
juliet
was
still
asleep
it
was
probable
for
more
than
once
she
had
slept
on
the
sofa
all
night
but
the
kindly
fate
that
had
hitherto
guided
him
suddenly
failed
him
now
when
he
reached
home
panting
and
breathless
having
discovered
that
it
was
almost
midnight
a
drooping
little
figure
in
a
torn
kimona
opened
the
door
and
fell
weeping
into
his
arms
oh
romie
romie
cried
juliet
hysterically
where
have
you
been
there
he
said
patting
her
shoulder
awkwardly
do
take
on
so
jule
you
were
asleep
so
i
went
out
for
a
walk
i
met
colonel
kent
and
allison
and
i
been
with
them
all
the
evening
i
sorry
i
stayed
so
long
i
have
lied
he
continued
to
himself
exultantly
every
word
is
the
literal
truth
oh
romie
sobbed
juliet
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
i
do
care
where
you
been
as
long
as
i
got
you
back
we
twins
and
got
to
stand
by
each
other
romeo
gently
extricated
himself
from
her
clinging
arms
then
stooped
to
kiss
her
wet
cheek
you
bet
he
whispered
x
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
of
woman
isabel
was
ready
fully
an
hour
before
the
appointed
time
she
stood
before
the
fire
buttoning
a
new
glove
with
the
sense
of
abundant
leisure
that
new
gloves
demand
the
dancing
flames
picked
out
flashes
of
light
from
the
silver
spangles
of
her
gown
and
sent
them
into
the
farthest
corners
of
the
room
a
long
white
plume
nestled
against
her
dark
hair
and
shaded
her
face
from
the
light
but
even
in
the
shadow
she
was
brilliant
for
her
eyes
sparkled
and
the
high
colour
bloomed
upon
her
cheeks
madame
bernard
and
rose
sat
near
by
openly
admiring
her
she
was
almost
childish
in
her
delight
at
the
immediate
prospect
and
could
scarcely
wait
for
allison
to
call
for
her
she
went
to
the
window
and
peered
eagerly
into
the
darkness
waiting
isabel
my
dear
said
madame
kindly
never
wait
at
the
window
for
an
unmarried
man
nor
she
added
as
an
afterthought
for
a
married
man
unless
he
happens
to
be
your
own
husband
isabel
turned
back
into
the
room
smiling
her
colour
a
little
brighter
than
before
why
not
men
keep
best
returned
madame
somewhat
enigmatically
in
a
cool
dry
atmosphere
if
you
remember
that
fact
it
may
save
you
trouble
in
the
years
to
come
such
worldly
wisdom
laughed
rose
from
such
an
unworldly
woman
i
do
love
the
theatre
isabel
sighed
and
i
have
seen
a
play
for
a
long
time
i
afraid
we
have
done
as
much
as
we
might
to
make
it
pleasant
for
you
madame
continued
regretfully
but
we
try
to
do
better
and
doubtless
can
now
that
the
weather
is
improving
it
been
lots
nicer
than
staying
alone
in
a
hotel
the
girl
answered
i
used
to
go
to
the
matinee
a
good
deal
but
i
did
know
very
many
people
and
it
no
fun
to
go
alone
do
you
and
rose
ever
go
aunt
francesca
i
go
sometimes
said
rose
but
i
ca
even
get
her
started
the
little
grey
lady
laughed
and
tapped
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
her
folded
fan
i
fully
agree
with
the
clever
man
who
said
that
would
be
very
endurable
were
it
not
for
its
pleasures
far
back
somewhere
there
must
be
a
strain
of
scotch
ancestry
in
me
for
i
my
pleasure
sadly
which
means
commented
rose
that
the
things
other
people
find
amusing
do
not
necessarily
amuse
you
possibly
madame
assented
with
a
shrug
of
her
delicate
shoulders
but
unless
i
obliged
to
i
wo
sit
in
an
uncomfortable
chair
in
a
crowd
surrounded
by
many
perfumes
unhappily
mixed
be
played
to
by
a
bad
orchestra
walked
on
at
will
by
rude
men
and
in
the
meantime
watch
the
exaggerated
antics
of
people
who
can
not
make
themselves
heard
even
in
a
room
with
only
three
sides
to
it
i
took
her
to
a
comedy
once
in
a
frivolous
moment
explained
rose
and
she
never
forgiven
me
why
remind
me
of
it
questioned
madame
i
been
endeavouring
for
years
to
forget
it
isabel
eyes
wandered
anxiously
to
the
clock
she
had
a
strong
impulse
to
go
to
the
window
again
but
remembered
that
madame
would
not
approve
presently
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
outside
and
allison
very
handsome
in
his
evening
clothes
came
in
with
an
apology
for
his
tardiness
after
greeting
madame
bernard
and
rose
he
bowed
to
isabel
with
a
mock
deference
which
none
the
less
contained
subtle
flattery
silver
girl
he
said
you
do
me
too
much
honour
i
not
at
all
sure
that
one
escort
is
sufficient
for
so
much
loveliness
isabel
smiled
then
dimpled
irresistibly
she
had
a
secret
sense
of
triumph
which
she
did
not
stop
to
analyse
come
he
said
in
the
words
of
the
poet
carriage
waits
they
said
to
the
others
and
went
out
there
was
silence
in
the
room
until
the
sound
of
wheels
had
quite
died
away
then
rose
sighed
with
a
swift
pang
she
envied
isabel
glorious
youth
then
the
blood
retreated
from
her
heart
in
shame
madame
sighed
too
but
for
a
different
reason
i
suppose
i
say
it
she
remarked
but
it
a
relief
to
have
that
dear
child
out
of
the
house
for
a
little
while
it
kind
of
allison
to
take
her
rose
answered
trying
not
to
wish
that
she
might
change
places
with
isabel
very
kind
the
kents
are
singularly
decent
about
everything
i
suppose
it
was
allison
who
managed
to
have
romeo
crosby
call
upon
her
the
other
evening
i
hardly
think
so
you
remember
that
allison
had
seen
him
since
he
grew
up
shot
up
you
mean
how
rapidly
weeds
grow
are
the
twins
weeds
i
think
so
still
they
a
wholesome
and
stimulating
sort
even
though
they
have
done
just
as
they
pleased
the
fire
died
down
into
embers
the
stillness
would
have
been
unbearable
had
it
not
been
for
the
steady
ticking
of
the
clock
madame
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
rose
tried
to
read
but
could
not
concentrate
her
mind
upon
the
page
her
thoughts
were
far
away
with
the
two
who
had
so
recently
left
the
house
in
fancy
she
saw
the
brilliantly
lighted
streets
the
throng
of
pleasure
seekers
and
pretty
women
in
gay
attire
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
the
persistent
of
motor
cars
and
in
the
playhouse
the
crash
of
cymbals
and
drums
somewhere
in
the
happy
crowd
were
allison
and
isabel
while
she
sat
in
silence
at
home
madame
francesca
stirred
in
her
chair
i
been
asleep
i
think
you
not
going
to
wait
until
they
come
home
are
you
why
should
i
isabel
has
a
key
rose
remembered
how
aunt
francesca
had
invariably
waited
for
her
when
some
gallant
cavalier
had
escorted
her
to
opera
or
play
and
was
foolishly
glad
for
no
discoverable
reason
i
was
dreaming
madame
went
on
drowsily
of
the
little
house
where
love
lived
where
was
it
asked
rose
gently
you
know
i
told
you
of
the
little
house
in
the
woods
where
i
went
as
a
bride
when
i
was
no
older
than
isabel
when
we
turned
the
key
and
went
away
we
must
have
left
some
of
our
love
there
i
never
been
back
but
i
like
to
think
that
some
of
the
sweetness
is
still
in
the
house
shut
away
like
a
jewel
of
great
price
safe
from
meddling
hands
only
once
before
in
the
fifteen
years
they
had
lived
together
had
madame
bernard
spoken
of
her
brief
marriage
yet
rose
knew
by
a
thousand
little
betrayals
that
the
past
was
not
dead
but
vitally
alive
i
can
bear
it
said
madame
half
to
herself
because
i
have
been
his
wife
if
he
had
been
taken
away
before
we
were
married
i
should
have
gone
too
but
now
i
have
only
to
wait
until
god
brings
us
together
again
outwardly
rose
was
calm
and
unperturbed
inwardly
tense
and
unstrung
she
wondered
if
at
last
the
sorrow
had
been
healed
enough
for
speech
upstairs
there
was
a
room
that
was
always
locked
no
one
but
aunt
francesca
ever
entered
it
and
she
but
rarely
once
or
twice
rose
had
chanced
to
see
her
coming
through
the
open
door
transfigured
by
some
spiritual
exaltation
too
great
for
words
for
days
afterward
there
was
about
her
a
certain
uplift
of
soul
fading
gradually
into
her
usual
serenity
boffin
stalked
in
jumped
into
madame
lap
and
began
to
purr
industriously
she
laughed
as
she
stroked
his
tawny
head
and
the
purr
increased
rapidly
in
speed
and
volume
do
let
him
burst
himself
cautioned
rose
welcoming
the
change
of
mood
i
never
knew
a
cat
to
purr
so
well
so
thoroughly
did
you
he
lost
his
hold
of
the
brake
madame
answered
are
you
going
to
wait
until
isabel
comes
home
of
course
not
then
let
go
up
and
read
for
a
little
while
rose
waited
until
madame
was
half
way
up
the
long
flight
before
she
turned
down
the
lights
and
followed
her
it
made
a
pretty
picture
the
little
lady
in
grey
on
the
long
stairway
with
the
yellow
cat
upon
her
shoulder
looking
back
with
the
inscrutable
calmness
of
the
sphinx
rose
felt
that
for
herself
sleep
would
be
impossible
until
isabel
returned
she
hoped
that
aunt
francesca
would
not
want
her
to
read
aloud
but
as
it
chanced
she
did
however
the
chosen
book
was
of
the
sort
which
banishes
insomnia
and
in
less
than
an
hour
madame
was
sound
asleep
with
boffin
purring
in
his
luxurious
basket
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
alone
in
her
own
room
rose
waited
frankly
jealous
of
her
young
cousin
and
fiercely
despising
herself
for
it
she
recalled
the
happy
hours
she
and
allison
had
spent
with
their
music
and
berated
herself
bitterly
for
her
selfishness
but
to
no
avail
as
the
hours
dragged
by
every
moment
seemed
an
eternity
worn
by
her
unaccustomed
struggle
with
self
she
finally
slept
meanwhile
isabel
was
the
gayest
of
the
gay
the
glittering
lights
of
the
playhouse
formed
a
fitting
background
for
her
and
allison
watched
her
beautiful
changing
face
with
an
sense
of
delight
the
play
itself
was
an
old
story
to
him
but
the
girl
was
a
new
sensation
and
while
she
watched
the
mimic
world
beyond
the
footlights
he
watched
her
the
curtain
of
the
first
act
descended
upon
a
woman
waiting
at
the
window
for
a
man
who
did
not
come
and
most
happily
isabel
remembered
the
conversation
at
home
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
foolish
woman
she
said
to
wait
at
the
window
why
asked
allison
secretly
amused
i
would
wait
at
the
window
for
an
unmarried
man
nor
for
a
married
man
either
unless
he
was
my
own
husband
why
he
asked
again
because
men
keep
best
in
a
cool
dry
atmosphere
did
you
know
that
how
did
you
happen
to
discover
it
isabel
answered
with
a
smile
which
meant
much
or
little
as
one
chose
presently
she
remembered
something
else
that
happened
to
be
useful
look
she
said
indicating
a
man
in
the
front
seat
who
had
fallen
asleep
he
taking
his
pleasure
sadly
perhaps
he
happier
to
be
asleep
he
may
not
care
for
the
play
somebody
once
said
she
went
on
hastily
seeing
that
she
was
making
a
good
impression
that
life
would
be
very
endurable
were
it
not
for
its
pleasures
allison
laughed
he
had
the
sense
of
discovering
a
bright
star
that
had
been
temporarily
overshadowed
by
surrounding
planets
i
did
know
you
could
talk
so
well
he
observed
with
evident
admiration
isabel
flushed
with
pleasure
not
guilt
she
had
no
thought
of
sailing
under
false
colours
but
reflected
the
life
about
her
as
innocently
as
a
mirror
might
if
conveniently
placed
repeated
curtain
calls
for
the
leading
woman
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
delayed
the
final
curtain
by
the
few
minutes
that
would
have
enabled
them
to
catch
the
earlier
of
the
two
theatre
trains
allison
was
not
wholly
displeased
though
he
feared
that
aunt
francesca
and
rose
might
be
unduly
anxious
about
isabel
as
they
had
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
to
wait
before
the
last
train
he
suggested
going
to
a
popular
restaurant
thrilled
with
pleasure
and
excitement
she
eagerly
consented
fortunately
she
did
not
have
to
talk
much
for
the
chatter
of
the
gay
crowd
and
the
orchestra
made
conversation
difficult
if
not
impossible
i
never
been
in
a
place
like
this
before
she
ventured
so
late
i
mean
but
you
enjoy
it
do
you
oh
yes
so
much
the
dark
eyes
that
turned
to
his
were
full
of
happy
eagerness
like
a
child
allison
pulses
quickened
with
man
insatiable
love
of
youth
do
it
again
he
said
if
you
come
with
me
i
will
if
aunt
francesca
will
let
me
she
willing
to
trust
you
with
me
i
think
she
known
me
ever
since
i
was
born
and
she
helped
father
bring
me
up
aunt
francesca
has
been
like
a
mother
to
me
she
says
she
does
care
for
the
theatre
resumed
isabel
who
did
not
care
to
talk
about
aunt
francesca
but
i
love
it
i
believe
i
could
go
every
night
do
make
the
mistake
of
going
too
often
to
see
what
pleases
you
for
you
might
tire
of
it
perhaps
plays
best
in
a
cool
dry
atmosphere
as
you
say
men
do
you
laughing
at
me
she
said
reproachfully
indeed
i
not
i
knew
a
man
once
who
fell
desperately
in
love
with
a
woman
and
as
soon
as
he
found
that
she
cared
for
him
he
started
for
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
what
for
that
they
might
not
risk
losing
their
love
for
each
other
through
satiety
you
know
it
said
to
die
more
often
of
indigestion
than
starvation
i
do
know
anything
about
it
she
murmured
with
downcast
eyes
you
will
though
before
long
some
awkward
young
man
about
twenty
will
come
to
you
bearing
the
divine
fire
i
do
know
any
she
answered
how
about
the
pleasing
child
who
called
upon
you
the
other
night
with
the
imported
bonbons
allison
tone
was
not
wholly
kind
for
he
had
just
discovered
that
he
did
not
like
romeo
crosby
isabel
became
fairly
radiant
with
smiles
was
he
too
funny
he
all
right
returned
allison
generously
i
afraid
however
that
he
be
taking
you
out
so
much
that
i
wo
have
a
chance
oh
no
said
isabel
softly
then
she
added
with
frankness
utterly
free
from
coquetry
i
like
you
much
better
really
why
please
oh
i
do
know
you
so
much
more
well
you
know
and
more
refined
thank
you
i
glad
the
slight
foreign
polish
distinguishes
me
somewhat
cousin
rose
said
you
were
very
distinguished
she
watched
him
narrowly
as
she
spoke
so
is
cousin
rose
in
fact
no
one
could
be
more
so
he
answered
with
evident
approval
is
she
going
to
play
your
accompaniments
for
you
when
you
begin
the
season
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
i
afraid
not
i
wish
she
could
why
ca
she
on
account
of
madame
grundy
it
would
be
proper
i
do
see
why
objected
isabel
daringly
she
ten
years
older
than
you
are
allison
bit
his
lips
and
the
expression
of
his
face
subtly
changed
you
ten
years
younger
he
replied
coldly
and
i
could
take
you
that
does
make
any
difference
seeing
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
isabel
sat
quietly
in
her
chair
and
watched
the
people
around
her
until
it
was
time
to
go
greatly
to
her
delight
they
went
to
the
station
in
an
automobile
is
this
glorious
she
cried
i
so
glad
the
crosbys
are
going
to
have
one
i
hope
they
take
me
often
with
the
sure
instinct
of
primitive
woman
she
had
said
the
one
thing
calculated
to
make
allison
forget
his
momentary
change
of
mood
i
sorry
i
have
none
he
said
romeo
wherefore
art
thou
romeo
how
times
have
changed
the
modern
lochinvar
has
a
and
some
day
you
be
eloping
in
the
most
fashion
what
makes
you
talk
to
me
about
him
queried
isabel
with
uplifted
eyes
you
know
i
do
like
him
all
right
he
answered
i
wo
i
hope
aunt
francesca
wo
be
worried
about
you
because
we
so
late
in
getting
back
i
do
see
why
she
should
mind
mamma
never
cares
what
i
do
often
been
away
for
weeks
lecturing
and
i
been
in
the
hotel
alone
he
repressed
the
uncharitable
comment
that
was
upon
his
lips
and
reverted
to
the
subject
of
the
play
i
glad
you
enjoyed
it
i
wanted
you
to
have
a
good
time
i
had
the
best
time
i
ever
had
in
my
life
she
responded
with
evident
sincerity
is
it
wonderful
what
they
can
do
with
a
room
that
has
only
three
sides
it
surely
is
i
had
a
good
time
too
silver
girl
thank
you
for
coming
you
welcome
she
returned
sweetly
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
station
and
isabel
was
very
quiet
all
the
way
home
thinking
that
she
must
be
tired
allison
said
little
until
they
reached
madame
bernard
and
he
had
seen
her
safely
into
the
house
he
insisted
upon
taking
off
her
gloves
and
coat
and
would
have
extended
his
friendly
services
to
her
hat
had
she
not
laughingly
forbade
him
to
touch
it
he
said
we
go
again
soon
all
right
and
thank
you
ever
so
much
the
sound
of
the
key
in
the
lock
had
wakened
rose
from
her
uneasy
sleep
she
heard
their
laughter
though
she
could
not
distinguish
what
they
said
and
recognised
a
new
tone
in
allison
voice
she
heard
the
door
close
the
carriage
roll
away
and
after
a
little
isabel
hushed
footsteps
on
the
stairs
then
another
door
closed
softly
and
a
light
glimmered
afar
into
the
garden
until
the
shade
was
drawn
and
fearful
she
slept
no
more
for
the
brimming
cup
of
joy
that
had
seemed
within
her
reach
was
surely
beyond
it
now
oppressed
with
loss
and
pain
her
heart
beat
slowly
as
though
it
were
weary
of
living
until
daybreak
she
wondered
if
he
too
was
keeping
the
night
watch
from
a
wholly
different
point
of
view
but
allison
had
long
ago
gone
to
sleep
in
the
big
colonial
house
beyond
the
turn
in
the
road
idly
humming
to
himself
come
and
kiss
me
youth
a
stuff
will
not
endure
xi
keeping
the
faith
colonel
kent
and
allison
critically
surveyed
the
table
where
covers
were
laid
for
seven
someway
it
lacks
the
air
of
madame
bernard
commented
the
colonel
yet
i
ca
see
anything
wrong
can
you
not
a
thing
allison
returned
the
air
you
allude
to
comes
i
think
from
aunt
francesca
herself
when
she
takes
her
place
opposite
you
i
sure
we
shall
compare
very
favourably
with
our
neighbours
the
crosby
twins
arrived
first
having
chartered
the
station
hack
for
the
evening
as
the
minds
of
both
were
above
such
minor
details
as
clothes
their
attire
was
of
the
nondescript
variety
but
their
exuberant
youth
and
high
spirits
gallantly
concealed
all
defects
and
the
tact
of
their
hosts
quickly
set
them
both
at
their
ease
romeo
somewhat
ostentatiously
left
their
card
upon
the
mantel
so
placed
that
all
who
came
near
might
read
in
fashionable
script
the
crosby
twins
having
made
this
concession
to
the
conventionalities
he
lapsed
at
once
into
an
agreeable
informality
that
amused
the
colonel
very
much
soon
the
colonel
was
describing
some
of
the
great
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
part
and
romeo
listened
with
an
eager
interest
which
was
all
the
more
flattering
because
it
was
so
evidently
sincere
in
the
library
meanwhile
allison
was
renewing
his
old
acquaintance
with
juliet
you
used
to
be
a
perfect
little
devil
he
smiled
i
am
yet
juliet
admitted
with
a
frank
laugh
at
least
people
say
so
romie
and
i
are
popular
with
our
neighbours
that
does
speak
well
for
the
neighbours
were
they
never
young
themselves
i
do
believe
so
i
thought
sometimes
that
lots
of
people
were
born
they
say
abroad
that
there
are
no
children
in
america
that
they
are
merely
little
people
treated
like
the
modern
american
child
is
a
horror
said
juliet
unconsciously
quoting
from
an
article
in
a
recent
magazine
they
ill
bred
and
they
do
mind
and
there
nobody
who
wants
to
make
mind
except
people
who
have
no
authority
to
do
it
why
is
it
inquired
allison
secretly
amused
because
spanking
has
gone
out
of
fashion
she
answered
in
all
seriousness
it
takes
so
much
longer
for
moral
suasion
to
work
romie
and
i
never
had
any
suasion
we
were
brought
up
right
juliet
tone
indicated
a
deep
filial
respect
for
her
departed
parents
and
there
was
a
faraway
look
in
her
blue
eyes
which
filled
allison
with
tender
pity
you
must
be
lonely
sometimes
he
said
kindly
lonely
repeated
juliet
in
astonishment
why
how
could
i
ever
be
lonely
with
romie
of
course
you
could
be
lonely
when
he
was
there
but
you
must
miss
him
when
he
away
from
you
he
never
away
she
answered
with
a
toss
of
her
curly
head
most
always
together
unless
he
goes
to
town
or
up
to
your
house
she
added
as
an
afterthought
allison
was
about
to
say
that
romeo
had
never
been
there
before
but
wisely
kept
silent
twins
are
the
most
related
of
anybody
juliet
went
on
an
older
brother
or
sister
may
get
ahead
of
you
and
be
so
different
that
you
never
catch
up
but
twins
have
to
trot
right
along
together
it
just
the
difference
between
tandem
and
double
harness
suppose
romeo
should
marry
queried
allison
carelessly
i
die
replied
juliet
firmly
her
cheeks
burning
as
with
flame
or
suppose
you
married
then
romie
would
die
she
answered
with
conviction
we
both
promised
not
to
get
married
and
we
always
keep
our
promises
to
each
other
and
to
other
people
too
not
always
sometimes
it
necessary
to
break
a
promise
or
to
lie
but
never
to
each
other
if
romie
asks
me
anything
i
do
want
to
tell
him
i
just
say
x
and
if
i
ask
him
anything
he
says
none
of
your
business
and
it
all
right
twins
have
to
be
square
with
each
other
do
you
ever
quarrel
we
may
differ
and
of
course
we
have
fought
sometimes
but
it
last
long
we
can
always
arbitrate
say
do
you
know
isabel
ross
i
have
that
pleasure
she
coming
to
dinner
with
aunt
francesca
and
miss
rose
oh
said
juliet
in
astonishment
if
i
known
that
i
have
dressed
up
more
i
thought
it
was
just
us
it
is
us
he
assured
her
kindly
a
very
small
and
select
party
composed
of
our
most
charming
neighbours
and
believe
me
my
dear
miss
juliet
that
nobody
could
possibly
be
up
more
juliet
bloomed
with
pleasure
and
her
eyes
sparkled
isabel
came
out
to
see
us
she
continued
and
i
do
think
she
had
a
good
time
we
showed
her
all
our
fishing
rods
and
let
her
help
us
make
fudges
and
we
did
stunts
for
her
on
the
trapeze
in
the
attic
and
romie
told
her
she
could
have
any
one
of
our
dogs
but
she
said
she
did
want
it
and
she
would
stay
to
supper
i
guess
she
thought
i
could
cook
just
because
she
ca
romie
said
if
i
make
another
chocolate
cake
like
the
one
i
made
the
day
after
she
was
there
he
take
it
up
to
her
and
show
her
whether
i
could
cook
or
not
i
believe
he
would
returned
allison
with
a
trace
of
sarcasm
which
juliet
entirely
missed
then
he
laughed
at
the
vision
of
romeo
bearing
the
proof
of
his
twin
culinary
skill
into
madame
bernard
living
room
you
come
out
and
see
us
urged
juliet
hospitably
i
will
indeed
may
i
have
a
dog
they
romie
and
i
ca
give
away
but
i
guess
he
could
spare
you
one
would
you
rather
have
a
puppy
or
a
dog
i
have
to
see
first
he
replied
tactfully
steering
away
from
the
danger
of
a
choice
he
had
not
felt
the
need
of
a
dog
and
was
merely
trying
to
be
pleasant
there
plenty
to
see
she
went
on
with
a
winning
smile
i
like
dogs
myself
but
we
fought
once
because
i
thought
we
had
too
many
we
named
all
out
of
an
old
book
we
found
in
the
attic
there
achilles
and
hector
and
persephone
and
minerva
and
circe
and
juno
and
priam
and
eurydice
and
goodness
knows
how
many
more
romie
knows
all
their
names
but
i
do
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
outside
colonel
kent
with
a
certain
fashioned
hospitality
to
which
our
generation
might
happily
return
went
to
open
the
door
himself
for
his
expected
guests
juliet
went
hastily
to
the
mirror
to
make
sure
that
her
turbulent
curls
were
in
order
and
romeo
intercepted
allison
on
his
way
to
the
door
i
heard
what
she
said
romeo
remarked
in
a
low
tone
about
my
having
been
up
here
but
i
did
tell
her
i
was
here
i
do
lie
to
jule
but
i
responsible
only
for
what
i
say
not
for
what
she
thinks
allison
smiled
with
full
understanding
of
the
situation
we
men
have
to
be
careful
what
we
say
to
women
he
replied
with
an
air
of
caution
and
comradeship
that
made
his
young
guest
feel
like
a
man
of
the
world
sure
assented
romeo
with
a
broad
grin
and
a
movement
of
one
eyelid
which
was
almost
but
not
quite
a
wink
presently
the
three
other
guests
came
in
followed
by
the
colonel
madame
francesca
was
in
white
silk
over
which
violets
had
been
scattered
with
a
lavish
hand
then
woven
into
the
shining
fabric
she
wore
violets
in
her
hair
and
at
her
belt
and
a
single
amethyst
at
her
throat
isabel
was
in
white
with
flounces
of
spangled
lace
and
rose
was
unusually
lovely
in
a
gown
of
old
gold
satin
and
a
necklace
of
palest
topaz
in
her
dark
hair
was
a
single
yellow
rose
juliet
was
for
the
moment
aghast
at
so
much
magnificence
and
painfully
conscious
of
her
own
white
muslin
gown
madame
francesca
reading
her
thought
drew
the
girl
tall
head
down
and
kissed
her
what
a
clover
blossom
you
are
she
said
all
in
freshest
white
with
pink
cheeks
and
sunshiny
curls
thus
fortified
juliet
did
not
mind
isabel
instinctive
careful
appraisement
of
her
gown
and
she
missed
happily
the
evident
admiration
with
which
romeo
eyes
followed
isabel
every
movement
why
did
you
tell
me
allison
was
asking
rose
so
i
could
have
ransacked
the
town
for
golden
roses
i
repeatedly
done
it
myself
laughed
rose
without
success
i
usually
save
my
yellow
gowns
for
june
when
all
the
yellow
rose
bushes
in
the
garden
may
lavish
their
wealth
upon
me
happy
rose
allison
returned
lightly
to
die
in
so
glorious
a
cause
the
twins
were
almost
at
the
point
of
starvation
when
dinner
was
announced
though
they
had
partaken
liberally
of
bread
and
butter
and
jam
just
before
leaving
home
romeo
had
complained
a
little
but
had
not
been
sufficiently
spartan
to
refuse
the
offered
refreshment
i
do
see
why
you
want
to
feed
me
now
and
spoil
my
dinner
he
grumbled
as
he
reached
out
for
a
second
slice
i
do
want
to
spoil
your
dinner
juliet
had
answered
with
her
mouth
full
ca
you
see
i
eating
too
we
do
want
to
be
impolite
when
we
invited
out
and
eat
too
much
you
been
reading
the
etiquette
book
remarked
romeo
with
unusual
insight
and
there
more
foolish
things
in
that
book
than
in
any
other
we
got
when
we
invited
out
to
eat
why
should
we
eat
they
may
have
been
cooking
for
days
just
to
get
ready
for
us
and
they
wo
like
it
if
we
only
pick
at
things
maybe
they
want
some
left
juliet
replied
brushing
aside
the
crumbs
i
remember
how
mad
mamma
was
once
when
the
minister
ate
two
pieces
of
pie
and
she
had
to
make
another
the
next
day
or
divide
one
piece
between
you
and
me
i
bet
she
made
another
she
always
fed
us
and
i
remember
that
the
kids
around
the
corner
could
even
have
bread
and
molasses
between
meals
on
the
way
to
the
juliet
drew
her
brother
aside
and
whispered
to
him
watch
the
others
then
you
be
sure
of
getting
the
right
fork
huh
he
returned
resentfully
having
been
accustomed
to
only
one
fork
since
he
and
juliet
began
to
keep
house
for
themselves
when
he
saw
the
array
of
silver
at
his
plate
however
he
blessed
her
for
the
hint
as
the
dinner
progressed
by
small
portions
of
oysters
soup
and
fish
he
gratefully
remembered
the
bread
and
jam
the
twins
noted
that
the
others
always
left
a
little
on
their
plates
but
proudly
disdained
the
subterfuge
for
themselves
madame
francesca
sat
opposite
the
colonel
and
rose
was
at
his
right
romeo
sat
next
to
her
and
across
from
them
was
allison
between
isabel
and
juliet
somewhat
subdued
by
the
unfamiliar
situation
the
twins
said
very
little
during
dinner
juliet
took
careful
note
of
the
appointments
of
the
table
and
and
of
the
gowns
the
other
women
wore
when
romeo
was
not
occupied
with
his
dinner
and
the
various
forks
he
watched
isabel
with
frank
admiration
and
wondered
what
made
the
difference
between
her
and
juliet
everybody
tried
to
produce
general
conversation
but
could
extract
only
polite
monosyllables
from
the
twins
questions
addressed
directly
to
them
were
briefly
answered
by
yes
or
no
or
i
do
know
or
more
often
by
a
winning
smile
which
included
them
all
had
it
not
been
for
madame
francesca
gallantly
assisted
by
the
colonel
the
abnormal
silence
of
the
younger
guests
might
have
reacted
unfavourably
upon
the
entertainment
for
isabel
was
as
quiet
as
she
usually
was
in
the
presence
of
her
aunt
and
cousin
allison
became
unable
to
think
of
topics
of
general
interest
and
rose
efforts
to
talk
pleasantly
while
her
heart
was
aching
were
no
more
successful
than
such
efforts
usually
are
but
madame
francesca
putting
aside
the
burden
of
her
seventy
years
laughed
and
talked
and
told
stories
with
all
the
zest
of
a
girl
inspired
by
her
shining
example
the
colonel
dragged
forth
a
few
musty
old
anecdotes
and
offered
them
for
inspection
they
were
new
to
the
younger
generation
and
madame
affected
to
find
them
new
also
rose
wondered
at
her
as
often
envying
her
the
gift
of
detachment
the
fear
that
had
come
upon
rose
at
midnight
was
with
her
still
haunting
her
waking
or
sleeping
like
some
evil
thing
proudly
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
seek
no
man
though
her
heart
should
break
for
love
of
him
that
though
her
soul
writhed
in
anguish
neither
he
nor
the
woman
who
took
him
from
her
should
ever
even
suspect
she
cared
she
forced
herself
to
meet
allison
eyes
with
a
smile
to
answer
his
questions
and
to
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
when
madame
or
the
colonel
paused
yet
with
every
sense
at
its
keenest
she
noted
downcast
eyes
the
air
with
which
allison
spoke
to
her
and
the
exaggerated
consideration
of
juliet
which
he
instinctively
adopted
as
a
shield
she
saw
too
that
isabel
was
secretly
annoyed
whenever
allison
spoke
to
juliet
and
easily
translated
the
encouraging
air
with
which
isabel
met
romeo
admiring
glances
once
when
he
happened
to
turn
quickly
enough
to
see
a
shadow
crossed
allison
face
and
he
bit
his
lips
how
civilised
the
world
has
become
madame
was
saying
lightly
the
mere
breaking
of
bread
together
precludes
all
open
hostility
bitter
enemies
may
meet
calmly
at
the
dinner
table
of
a
mutual
friend
and
i
understand
that
in
the
higher
circles
in
which
we
do
not
care
to
move
a
man
may
escort
his
divorced
wife
out
to
dinner
and
without
bitterness
congratulate
her
upon
her
approaching
marriage
i
often
thought
returned
the
colonel
more
seriously
that
the
modern
marriage
service
should
be
changed
to
read
death
or
divorce
do
us
part
it
highly
inconsistent
as
it
stands
is
the
hobgoblin
of
little
minds
she
quoted
inconsistency
goes
as
far
toward
making
life
attractive
as
its
pleasures
do
toward
spoiling
it
what
do
you
call
pleasure
queried
allison
the
unsought
joy
if
you
go
out
to
hunt
for
it
you
do
often
get
it
when
you
do
you
earned
it
and
are
entitled
to
it
true
pleasure
is
a
free
gift
of
the
gods
like
a
sense
of
humour
by
some
oblique
and
unsuspected
way
the
words
brought
a
certain
comfort
to
rose
without
bitterness
she
remembered
that
allison
had
once
said
in
any
true
mating
they
both
know
over
and
over
again
she
said
to
herself
stubbornly
i
will
have
nothing
that
is
not
true
nothing
that
is
not
true
it
was
a
wise
hostess
who
discovered
the
fact
that
changing
rooms
may
change
moods
that
many
a
successful
dinner
has
an
aftermath
in
the
as
cold
and
dismal
as
a
party
call
madame
francesca
had
once
characterised
the
hour
after
dinner
as
the
stick
of
a
which
never
fails
to
return
and
bring
disillusion
with
it
hence
she
postponed
it
as
long
as
she
could
but
the
colonel
himself
gave
the
signal
by
moving
back
his
chair
an
awkward
pause
followed
which
lasted
until
rose
went
to
the
piano
of
her
own
accord
and
began
to
play
at
length
she
drifted
into
the
running
chords
of
a
familiar
accompaniment
and
allison
took
his
violin
and
joined
in
as
he
stood
by
rose
the
mere
fact
of
his
nearness
brought
her
a
strange
peace
had
she
looked
up
she
would
have
seen
that
though
he
stood
so
near
her
he
had
eyes
only
for
isabel
and
was
playing
to
her
alone
isabel
did
not
seem
to
care
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
idly
in
her
lap
occasionally
glancing
at
the
twins
who
sat
together
on
a
sofa
across
the
room
madame
bernard
and
the
colonel
had
gone
out
on
the
balcony
that
opened
off
of
the
library
the
night
was
cool
yet
had
in
it
the
softness
of
may
every
wandering
wind
brought
a
subtle
exquisite
fragrance
from
orchards
blooming
afar
high
in
the
heavens
swung
the
pale
gold
moon
of
spring
what
a
night
said
madame
almost
in
a
whisper
it
seems
almost
as
if
there
never
had
been
another
spring
and
as
if
there
never
would
be
another
that
may
be
true
for
one
or
both
of
us
she
replied
with
unwonted
sadness
my
work
is
done
sighed
the
colonel
i
have
only
to
wait
now
sometimes
i
think
that
all
of
life
is
waiting
she
went
on
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
and
yet
we
never
know
what
we
were
waiting
for
unless
when
all
is
done
a
warm
friendly
hand
closed
over
hers
do
not
question
too
much
dear
friend
for
the
god
who
ordained
the
beginning
can
safely
be
trusted
with
the
end
as
well
as
with
all
that
lies
between
do
you
know
he
continued
in
a
different
tone
a
night
like
this
always
makes
me
think
of
those
wonderful
lines
blessed
damozel
leaned
out
from
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
her
eyes
were
deeper
than
the
depth
of
waters
stilled
at
even
she
had
three
lilies
in
her
hand
and
the
stars
in
her
hair
were
seven
francesca
eyes
filled
and
the
stars
swam
before
her
for
she
remembered
the
three
white
lilies
the
colonel
had
put
into
the
still
hands
of
his
boy
mother
just
before
the
casket
was
closed
i
wonder
she
breathed
if
they
know
i
wonder
too
he
said
the
strains
of
the
violin
floated
out
upon
the
scented
night
vibrant
with
love
and
longing
with
passion
and
pain
something
had
come
into
the
music
that
was
never
there
before
but
only
rose
knew
it
richard
said
francesca
suddenly
if
you
should
go
first
and
it
should
be
as
we
hope
and
pray
it
may
be
if
people
know
each
other
there
and
can
speak
and
be
understood
will
you
tell
him
that
i
am
keeping
the
faith
that
i
have
only
been
waiting
since
we
parted
yes
and
if
it
should
be
the
other
way
will
you
tell
her
that
i
too
am
waiting
and
keeping
the
faith
and
that
i
have
done
well
with
our
boy
i
will
she
promised
the
last
chord
of
violin
and
piano
died
into
silence
colonel
kent
bent
down
and
lifted
madame
hand
to
his
lips
then
they
went
in
together
xii
an
enchanted
hour
the
days
dragged
on
so
wearily
that
to
rose
the
hours
seemed
unending
allison
came
to
the
house
frequently
but
seldom
spoke
of
his
music
for
more
than
a
week
he
did
not
ask
her
to
play
at
all
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
brought
his
violin
with
him
the
old
harmony
seemed
entirely
gone
the
pianist
fingers
often
stumbled
over
the
keys
even
though
allison
played
with
new
authority
and
that
magical
power
that
goes
by
the
name
of
inspiration
for
want
of
a
better
word
once
she
made
a
mistake
changing
a
full
chord
into
a
dissonance
so
harsh
and
that
allison
shuddered
then
frowned
when
they
had
finished
he
turned
to
her
saying
kindly
you
tired
rose
i
been
a
selfish
brute
and
let
you
work
too
hard
quick
denial
was
on
her
lips
but
she
stopped
in
time
and
followed
his
lead
gracefully
yes
and
my
head
aches
too
if
all
of
you
will
excuse
me
i
go
up
and
rest
for
a
little
while
evening
after
evening
she
made
the
same
excuse
longing
for
her
own
room
with
a
locked
and
bolted
door
between
her
and
the
outer
world
lonely
and
miserable
though
she
was
she
had
at
least
the
sense
of
shelter
pride
too
sustained
her
for
looking
back
to
the
night
they
met
months
ago
she
could
remember
no
word
nor
act
or
even
a
look
of
hers
that
had
been
out
of
keeping
over
and
over
again
she
insisted
to
herself
stubbornly
i
will
have
nothing
that
is
not
true
nothing
that
is
not
true
in
the
midnight
silences
when
she
lay
wide
awake
though
all
the
rest
of
the
world
slept
the
words
chimed
in
with
her
nothing
that
is
not
true
nothing
that
is
not
true
madame
francesca
loving
rose
dearly
became
sorely
troubled
and
perplexed
she
could
not
fail
to
see
and
understand
and
at
times
feared
that
allison
and
isabel
must
see
and
understand
also
she
watched
rose
faithfully
and
shielded
her
at
every
possible
point
when
isabel
inquired
why
rose
was
always
tired
in
the
evening
madame
explained
that
she
had
been
working
too
hard
and
that
she
had
made
her
promise
to
rest
rose
spent
more
time
than
usual
at
the
piano
but
she
neglected
her
own
work
in
favour
of
allison
accompaniments
when
she
was
alone
she
could
play
them
creditably
even
without
the
notes
but
if
by
any
chance
he
stood
beside
her
waiting
until
the
prelude
was
finished
she
faltered
at
the
first
sound
of
the
violin
at
last
she
gave
it
up
and
kept
more
and
more
to
her
own
room
madame
meditated
upon
the
advisability
of
sending
isabel
away
providing
it
could
be
done
gracefully
or
even
taking
her
on
some
brief
journey
thus
leaving
rose
in
full
possession
of
the
house
yet
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
it
would
be
only
a
subterfuge
that
it
was
better
to
meet
the
issues
of
life
squarely
than
to
attempt
to
hide
from
them
since
inevitably
all
must
be
met
she
could
not
bear
to
see
rose
hurt
nor
could
she
endure
easily
the
spectacle
of
her
beloved
foster
son
upon
the
verge
of
a
lifelong
mistake
several
times
she
thought
of
talking
to
colonel
kent
and
more
rarely
of
speaking
to
allison
himself
but
she
had
learned
to
apply
to
speech
the
old
maxim
referring
to
when
in
doubt
do
it
happened
that
allison
came
late
one
afternoon
when
isabel
had
gone
to
town
in
search
of
new
finery
and
rose
was
in
her
own
room
madame
had
just
risen
from
her
afternoon
nap
and
after
he
had
waited
a
few
moments
she
came
down
where
isabel
he
asked
as
he
greeted
her
shopping
smiled
madame
i
know
but
i
thought
she
be
at
home
by
this
time
she
told
me
she
was
coming
out
on
the
earlier
train
she
may
have
met
someone
and
gone
to
the
matinee
it
wednesday
she
did
need
to
do
that
i
take
her
whenever
she
wants
to
go
and
she
knows
it
i
did
say
she
had
gone
i
only
said
she
might
have
gone
she
may
be
waiting
for
the
trimming
of
a
hat
to
be
changed
or
for
an
appointment
with
tailor
or
dressmaker
or
manicure
or
any
one
of
a
thousand
other
things
when
you
see
her
she
can
doubtless
give
a
clear
account
of
herself
did
rose
go
with
her
he
asked
after
a
brief
pause
no
she
asleep
sighed
madame
allison
i
worried
about
rose
and
have
been
for
some
time
she
is
well
i
thought
something
was
wrong
he
replied
without
interest
she
ca
seem
to
play
even
the
simplest
accompaniment
any
more
and
she
used
to
do
wonders
even
with
heavy
work
i
think
ventured
madame
cautiously
that
she
needs
to
get
out
more
if
someone
would
take
her
for
a
walk
or
a
drive
every
day
it
would
do
her
good
probably
assented
allison
with
a
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
if
you
want
to
borrow
our
horses
at
any
time
aunt
francesca
when
yours
are
not
available
i
hope
you
feel
free
to
telephone
for
them
almost
eating
their
heads
off
and
the
exercise
would
do
them
good
thank
you
she
answered
shortly
allison
noted
the
veiled
sharpness
of
her
tone
and
wondered
why
anyone
should
take
even
slight
offence
at
the
friendly
offer
of
a
coach
and
pair
it
must
be
nearly
time
for
the
next
train
he
resumed
is
there
anyone
at
the
station
to
meet
isabel
nobody
but
the
coachman
and
the
carriage
returned
madame
dryly
not
in
the
habit
of
being
asked
whether
or
not
i
have
made
proper
provision
for
my
guests
i
beg
your
pardon
aunt
francesca
i
would
have
known
of
course
if
i
had
stopped
to
think
how
is
your
father
she
put
in
abruptly
all
right
i
guess
he
making
a
garden
and
the
whole
front
yard
is
torn
up
as
though
sewer
pipes
were
about
to
be
put
in
madame
heart
softened
with
pity
for
she
knew
that
only
loneliness
would
have
set
the
colonel
to
gardening
i
must
go
over
and
see
it
she
said
in
a
different
tone
my
valuable
advice
has
been
asked
but
i
think
i
could
help
a
little
undoubtedly
your
own
garden
is
one
of
the
loveliest
i
have
ever
seen
is
that
the
train
i
think
so
if
isabel
comes
i
believe
i
leave
you
to
entertain
her
while
i
drive
over
to
inspect
the
new
garden
she
was
oppressed
as
never
before
by
the
necessity
of
speech
and
of
all
those
around
her
colonel
kent
was
the
only
one
to
whom
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
say
a
word
she
did
not
stop
to
consider
what
she
could
accomplish
by
it
for
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
she
was
helpless
also
that
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
in
the
world
has
not
been
caused
by
silence
allison
drummed
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
until
he
heard
the
rumble
of
wheels
then
went
to
the
window
it
isabel
he
announced
joyously
i
go
down
and
help
her
out
she
may
have
parcels
presently
they
came
in
together
laughing
isabel
face
was
flushed
and
allison
was
heavily
laden
with
packages
both
small
and
large
i
feel
like
santa
claus
he
cried
gaily
to
madame
as
she
passed
them
on
the
way
out
she
smiled
but
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
speak
colonel
kent
she
called
to
the
driver
as
she
closed
the
carriage
door
with
a
resounding
bang
and
please
hurry
the
colonel
was
on
the
veranda
when
she
arrived
superintending
the
gardening
operations
from
there
he
greeted
her
with
surprise
for
it
was
not
her
way
to
drive
over
there
alone
i
am
deeply
honoured
he
said
as
he
assisted
her
up
the
steps
may
i
order
tea
no
thank
you
she
answered
somewhat
primly
it
was
evident
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
i
understood
from
allison
that
you
were
doing
all
this
yourself
instead
i
find
you
sitting
on
the
veranda
like
a
landed
proprietor
in
command
of
an
army
of
slaves
two
irishmen
do
make
an
army
he
laughed
though
i
admit
that
if
angry
they
would
make
a
formidable
force
i
helped
to
dig
for
a
while
this
morning
but
it
did
seem
to
agree
with
me
so
i
quit
my
work
seems
to
be
done
he
continued
with
a
sigh
no
it
is
she
returned
sharply
there
work
to
be
done
but
whether
you
or
i
or
both
together
can
do
it
is
extremely
doubtful
what
do
you
mean
francesca
madame
leaned
toward
him
confidentially
richard
she
said
in
a
low
tone
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
allison
might
marry
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
then
vanished
in
a
smile
yes
why
have
you
ever
seen
a
woman
you
would
be
willing
for
him
to
marry
only
one
and
she
rose
said
the
colonel
softly
your
rose
i
felt
that
way
too
whispered
madame
there
was
silence
for
the
space
of
a
then
she
cried
out
sharply
but
it
is
rose
it
isabel
what
he
cried
startled
for
once
out
of
his
usual
calm
that
child
child
is
past
twenty
and
he
is
only
ten
years
older
there
was
fifteen
years
difference
between
you
and
madame
forebore
to
speak
the
name
of
the
dead
and
beloved
wife
colonel
kent
turned
his
dim
blue
eyes
toward
the
hills
behind
them
the
sun
was
setting
and
he
could
guess
that
the
gold
of
the
spring
afternoon
was
scattered
like
star
dust
over
the
little
sunken
grave
he
left
madame
and
went
to
the
end
of
the
veranda
where
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
facing
the
west
then
he
came
back
francesca
he
said
slowly
you
and
i
are
on
the
western
slope
and
have
been
for
a
long
time
the
valley
of
the
shadow
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
the
descent
is
almost
made
but
the
boy
is
young
and
most
of
the
journey
lies
before
him
you
chose
for
yourself
and
so
did
shall
we
not
grant
him
the
same
right
yes
but
rose
rose
interrupted
the
colonel
is
too
good
for
any
man
even
my
own
son
though
as
i
said
before
she
is
the
only
woman
i
would
willingly
see
him
marry
you
stand
almost
in
his
mother
place
to
him
but
neither
you
nor
i
can
shield
him
now
we
must
try
to
remember
that
his
life
is
his
to
make
or
mar
i
know
she
sighed
i
thought
it
all
out
besides
he
went
on
what
could
we
do
separation
would
last
long
if
he
wants
her
and
talking
would
only
alienate
him
from
us
perhaps
you
could
bear
it
but
i
i
could
nor
i
she
returned
quickly
when
we
come
to
the
sundown
road
we
need
all
the
love
we
have
managed
to
take
with
us
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
i
had
meant
to
say
anything
to
anyone
she
went
on
in
a
changed
tone
but
my
heart
was
full
and
you
are
your
best
friend
francesca
as
you
are
mine
it
seems
to
take
a
lifetime
for
us
to
learn
that
wisdom
consists
largely
in
a
graceful
acceptance
of
things
that
do
not
immediately
concern
us
how
like
you
she
responded
with
a
touch
of
her
old
manner
i
ask
for
comfort
and
you
give
me
an
epigram
many
people
find
satisfaction
in
epigrams
he
reminded
her
sometimes
a
is
better
than
an
oil
painting
or
a
geometrical
design
or
even
a
map
she
continued
catching
his
mood
the
talk
drifted
to
happier
themes
and
madame
was
quite
herself
again
at
dusk
when
she
rose
to
go
on
the
way
back
she
passed
allison
returning
home
to
dinner
by
a
worn
path
but
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
did
not
see
her
at
all
the
midnight
was
starred
here
and
there
with
white
blooms
when
may
went
out
and
june
came
in
drifts
of
bridal
wreath
were
banked
against
the
side
of
the
house
and
a
sweet
syringa
breathed
out
a
faint
perfume
toward
the
hedge
of
lilacs
beyond
blown
petals
of
pink
and
white
died
on
the
young
grass
beneath
madame
wild
tree
transplanted
from
a
distant
woodland
long
ago
to
glorify
her
garden
the
hour
was
one
of
enchantment
yet
to
rose
leaning
out
into
the
moonless
night
the
beauty
of
it
brought
only
pain
she
wondered
dully
if
she
should
ever
find
surcease
if
somewhere
on
the
thorny
path
ahead
there
might
not
be
some
place
where
she
could
lay
the
burden
of
her
heartache
down
her
pride
that
had
so
long
sustained
her
was
beginning
to
fail
her
now
it
no
longer
seemed
more
vital
than
life
itself
that
allison
should
not
know
she
had
the
hurt
woman
longing
for
escape
but
could
think
of
no
excuse
for
flight
she
knew
aunt
francesca
would
manage
it
in
some
way
should
she
ask
and
that
she
would
be
annoyed
by
no
troublesome
questions
yet
loyalty
held
her
fast
for
she
knew
how
lonely
the
little
old
lady
would
be
without
her
day
by
day
the
tension
increased
almost
to
the
breaking
point
june
filled
the
garden
with
rosebuds
but
their
pale
namesake
in
the
big
white
house
took
no
heed
of
them
she
no
longer
concerned
herself
about
her
gowns
but
wore
white
almost
constantly
that
her
pallor
might
not
show
the
roses
broke
from
their
green
sheaths
then
bloomed
opening
their
golden
hearts
to
every
wandering
bee
the
house
was
full
of
roses
aunt
francesca
wore
them
even
on
her
morning
gowns
and
isabel
made
wreaths
of
red
roses
to
twine
in
her
dark
hair
every
breeze
brought
fragrance
to
the
open
windows
and
scattered
it
through
the
house
madame
heart
ached
for
rose
but
still
she
said
no
word
though
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
blindness
of
the
others
could
not
last
much
longer
she
could
not
take
rose
away
unless
she
took
isabel
also
and
should
she
do
that
things
would
soon
be
just
as
they
were
now
as
rose
faded
isabel
blossomed
into
the
full
flower
of
her
youth
her
high
laugh
echoed
constantly
through
the
house
and
garden
whether
anyone
was
with
her
or
not
with
sinking
heart
rose
envied
her
even
a
tithe
of
her
abundant
joy
as
the
moon
approached
its
full
the
roses
had
begun
to
drop
their
petals
under
every
bush
was
a
scattered
bit
of
fragrance
that
meant
both
death
and
resurrection
far
down
in
the
garden
where
the
sunken
mirrored
the
stars
the
petals
of
golden
roses
drifted
idly
across
the
shining
surface
rose
had
worn
white
at
dinner
as
she
always
did
now
the
night
the
june
moon
came
to
its
full
isabel
too
was
in
white
but
with
a
difference
for
as
surely
as
the
older
woman
white
was
mourning
her
silver
spangles
were
donned
for
joy
at
the
table
madame
had
done
most
of
the
talking
for
isabel
conversational
gifts
were
limited
at
best
and
rose
was
weary
beyond
all
words
after
dinner
she
went
to
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
aimless
chords
isabel
with
a
murmured
excuse
went
up
to
her
own
room
nothing
that
is
not
true
said
rose
to
herself
steadily
nothing
that
is
not
true
presently
a
definite
thought
took
shape
in
her
mind
she
would
tell
aunt
francesca
and
see
if
it
could
not
be
arranged
for
her
to
go
away
somewhere
anywhere
alone
or
if
not
at
least
the
day
after
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
him
again
she
wanted
one
last
look
to
take
with
her
into
the
where
she
must
wrestle
with
her
soul
alone
illustration
musical
notation
her
stiff
fingers
shaped
the
melody
that
aunt
francesca
loved
and
into
it
went
all
her
own
longing
her
love
and
her
pain
the
notes
thrilled
with
an
ecstasy
of
renunciation
and
the
vibrant
chords
trembled
far
out
into
the
night
illustration
musical
notation
a
man
entered
the
gate
very
quietly
paused
then
turned
into
the
garden
to
soothe
his
wildly
beating
heart
for
a
few
moments
with
the
balm
of
scent
and
sound
upstairs
behind
the
shelter
of
the
swaying
curtain
a
shining
figure
drew
back
into
the
shadow
smiling
and
with
an
agreeable
sense
of
adventure
isabel
tiptoed
down
the
back
stairs
and
entered
the
garden
unheard
by
a
side
door
with
assumed
carelessness
yet
furtively
watching
she
made
the
circuit
of
the
humming
to
herself
a
quick
leap
and
a
light
foot
on
the
grass
startled
her
for
an
instant
then
she
laughed
for
it
was
only
boffin
playing
with
his
own
dancing
shadow
illustration
musical

the
sound
of
the
piano
had
become
very
faint
though
the
windows
were
open
and
the
wind
was
in
the
right
direction
isabel
stopped
at
another
bush
picked
a
few
white
roses
and
sat
down
on
a
garden
bench
to
remove
the
thorns
i
wonder
where
he
can
be
she
said
to
herself
surely
he
ca
have
gone
home
again
she
listened
but
there
was
no
sound
save
the
distant
piano
and
the
abrupt
playful
purr
of
boffin
as
he
pounced
upon
a
fallen
white
rose
isabel
put
the
flowers
in
her
hair
consciously
missing
the
mirror
in
which
she
was
wont
to
observe
the
effect
he
must
have
gone
in
while
i
was
coming
down
she
thought
but
i
do
see
why
he
should
have
gone
straight
in
when
he
first
came
she
decided
to
wait
until
he
came
to
look
for
her
then
as
swiftly
changed
her
mind
rose
was
still
playing
illustration

notation
isabel
hummed
the
melody
to
herself
not
noting
that
she
was
off
the
key
and
started
slowly
toward
the
house
by
another
path
allison
was
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
maple
listening
to
the
music
and
drawing
in
deep
breaths
of
the
air
the
moon
flooded
the
garden
with
enchantment
and
a
shaft
of
silver
light
striking
the
sundial
made
a
shadow
that
was
hours
wrong
he
smiled
as
he
saw
it
amiably
crediting
the
moon
with
an
accidental
error
rather
than
a
purposeful
lie
illustration
musical
notation
deeper
and
more
vibrant
the
woman
within
sent
the
cry
of
her
heart
into
the
night
where
the
only
one
who
could
answer
it
stood
watching
the
shadow
of
the
moon

the
and

spangled
cobwebs
on
the
grass
he
picked
a
rose
put
it
into
his
and
turned
toward
the
house
a
hushed
sound
as
of
rustling
silk
made
him
pause
then
at
the
head
of
the
path
where
another
joined
it
isabel
appeared
with
white
roses
in
her
hair
and
the
moon
shining
full
upon
her
face
the
spangles
on
her
gown
caught
the
light
and
broke
it
into
a
thousand
tiny
rainbows
surrounding
her
with
faint
iridescence
the
old
immortal
hunger
surged
into
his
veins
the
joy
made
his
senses
reel
he
steadied
himself
for
a
moment
then
went
to
her
with
his
arms
outstretched
in
pleading
oh
silver
girl
he
whispered
huskily
my
silver
girl
tell
me
you
shine
for
me
always
illustration
musical
notation
the
last
chord
ceased
full
of
yearning
that
was
almost
prayer
then
isabel
cold
as
marble
and
passionless
as
snow
lifted
her
face
for
his
betrothal
kiss
xiii
white
gloves
with
shyness
that
did
not
wholly
conceal
her
youthful
pride
isabel
told
madame
a
few
days
later
the
little
old
lady
managed
to
smile
and
to
kiss
isabel
soft
cheek
murmuring
the
conventional
hope
for
her
happiness
inwardly
she
was
far
from
calm
though
deeply
thankful
that
rose
did
not
happen
to
be
in
the
room
you
must
make
him
very
happy
dear
she
said
i
guess
we
have
a
good
time
returned
isabel
smothering
a
yawn
it
will
be
lots
of
fun
to
go
all
over
the
country
and
see
all
the
big
cities
i
hope
he
will
be
successful
madame
continued
he
must
be
she
added
fervently
i
suppose
we
shall
be
entertained
a
great
deal
remarked
isabel
he
has
written
to
mamma
but
she
has
had
time
to
answer
yet
i
can
vouch
for
my
foster
son
madame
replied
it
is
necessary
the
girl
went
on
and
i
told
him
so
mamma
never
cares
what
i
do
and
she
be
glad
to
get
me
off
her
hands
would
you
mind
if
i
were
married
here
madame
heart
throbbed
with
tender
pity
indeed
she
answered
warmly
you
shall
have
the
prettiest
wedding
i
can
give
you
your
mother
will
come
wo
she
not
if
it
would
interfere
with
her
lecture
engagements
she
going
to
lecture
all
next
season
on
slavery
of
marriage
she
says
the
wedding
ring
is
a
sign
of
bondage
dating
back
to
the
old
days
when
a
woman
was
her
husband
property
madame
francesca
blue
eyes
filled
with
a
sudden
mist
slowly
she
turned
on
her
finger
the
worn
band
of
gold
that
her
gallant
captain
had
placed
there
ere
he
went
to
war
it
carried
still
a
deep
remembrance
too
holy
for
speech
property
repeated
the
old
lady
in
a
whisper
ah
but
how
dear
it
is
to
be
owned
i
do
mind
wearing
it
said
isabel
with
a
patronising
air
but
i
want
it
as
narrow
as
possible
so
it
wo
interfere
with
my
other
rings
and
of
course
i
can
take
it
off
when
i
like
of
course
but
i
would
be
glad
to
have
you
so
happily
married
my
dear
that
you
would
want
to
take
it
off
ever
i
have
to
ask
mamma
to
send
me
some
money
for
clothes
the
girl
went
on
half
to
herself
do
bother
her
with
it
suggested
the
other
kindly
let
me
do
it
rose
and
i
will
enjoy
making
pretty
things
for
a
bride
i
afraid
cousin
rose
would
enjoy
it
isabel
replied
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
do
you
know
she
added
confidentially
i
always
thought
cousin
rose
liked
allison
well
a
good
deal
she
does
returned
madame
meeting
the
girl
eyes
clearly
and
so
do
i
when
you
older
isabel
you
learn
to
distinguish
between
a
mere
friendly
interest
and
the
grand
passion
she
too
old
i
know
isabel
continued
with
the
brutality
of
confident
youth
but
sometimes
older
women
do
fall
in
love
with
young
men
why
should
they
queried
madame
lightly
as
long
as
older
men
choose
to
fall
in
love
with
young
women
as
far
as
that
goes
it
would
be
no
worse
for
allison
to
marry
rose
than
it
is
for
him
to
marry
you
but
objected
isabel
when
he
is
sixty
she
will
be
seventy
and
he
would
care
for
her
and
returned
madame
rather
sharply
when
he
is
forty
you
will
be
only
thirty
and
you
may
not
care
for
him
there
are
always
two
sides
to
everything
she
added
after
a
pause
and
when
we
get
so
civilised
that
all
women
may
be
if
they
choose
we
may
see
a
little
advice
to
husbands
on
the
way
of
keeping
a
wife
love
instead
of
the
flood
of
nonsense
that
disfigures
the
periodicals
now
they
all
say
that
woman
makes
the
home
isabel
suggested
idly
but
not
alone
no
woman
can
make
a
home
alone
it
takes
two
pairs
of
hands
to
make
a
home
one
strong
and
the
other
tender
and
two
true
hearts
i
hope
it
wo
take
too
long
to
make
my
clothes
answered
isabel
irrelevantly
he
says
i
must
be
ready
by
september
then
we
must
begin
immediately
write
out
everything
you
think
of
and
afterward
we
go
over
the
list
together
come
into
the
library
and
begin
now
there
no
time
like
the
present
do
you
think
isabel
inquired
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
library
table
that
i
will
have
many
presents
probably
answered
madame
briefly
i
come
back
when
finished
your
list
she
went
and
knocked
gently
at
the
door
of
rose
room
feeling
very
much
as
she
did
the
day
she
went
to
colonel
kent
to
tell
him
that
the
little
mother
of
his
son
was
dead
rose
herself
opened
the
door
somewhat
surprised
madame
went
in
closed
the
door
then
stood
there
for
a
moment
at
a
loss
for
words
has
it
come
asked
rose
in
a
low
voice
yes
oh
rose
my
dear
rose
she
put
her
arm
around
the
younger
woman
and
led
her
to
the
couch
every
hint
of
colour
faded
from
rose
face
her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
her
lips
scarcely
pink
i
must
go
away
she
murmured
where
dearest
anywhere
oh
anywhere
i
know
dear
believe
me
i
know
but
it
never
does
any
good
to
run
away
from
things
that
must
be
faced
sooner
or
later
we
women
have
our
battles
to
fight
as
well
as
the
men
who
go
to
war
and
the
same
truth
applies
to
both
that
only
a
coward
will
retreat
under
fire
rose
sighed
and
clenched
her
hands
together
tightly
once
there
was
a
ship
said
madame
softly
sinking
in
surrounded
by
fog
it
had
drifted
far
out
of
its
course
and
collided
with
a
derelict
the
captain
ordered
the
band
to
play
the
officers
put
on
their
dress
uniforms
and
their
white
gloves
another
ship
that
was
drifting
too
signalled
in
answer
to
the
music
and
all
were
saved
that
was
possible
but
there
can
be
no
signal
for
me
perhaps
not
but
let
put
on
our
white
gloves
and
order
out
the
band
the
unconscious
plural
struck
rose
with
deep
significance
did
you
know
aunt
francesca
yes
dear
for
how
long
always
i
think
did
it
seem
absurd
in
any
way
not
at
all
i
was
hoping
for
it
until
the
wind
changed
and
she
added
with
her
face
turned
away
colonel
kent
was
too
some
of
the
colour
ebbed
slowly
back
into
the
white
stricken
face
that
makes
me
feel
rose
breathed
as
if
i
had
been
quite
so
foolish
as
i
been
thinking
i
was
then
keep
the
high
heart
dear
for
they
must
suspect
no
cried
rose
sharply
oh
no
anything
but
that
it
hard
to
wear
gloves
when
you
do
want
to
replied
madame
with
seeming
irrelevance
but
it
easier
when
there
are
others
the
colonel
will
need
them
too
this
is
going
to
be
hard
on
him
know
whispered
rose
fearfully
no
answered
madame
laughing
outright
indeed
he
does
did
you
ever
know
of
a
man
discovering
anything
that
was
right
under
his
nose
and
i
am
safe
with
everybody
but
isabel
she
may
be
foolish
but
she
a
woman
and
even
a
woman
can
see
around
a
corner
thank
you
for
telling
me
said
rose
after
a
little
for
giving
me
time
it
was
like
you
i
glad
i
could
but
remember
i
have
told
you
officially
let
her
tell
you
herself
rose
nodded
then
i
come
down
just
as
soon
as
i
can
with
white
gloves
on
dear
and
flags
flying
make
your
old
aunt
proud
of
you
now
wo
you
i
try
she
answered
humbly
then
quickly
closed
the
door
meanwhile
colonel
kent
most
correctly
attired
was
making
a
formal
call
upon
his
prospective
and
the
list
had
scarcely
been
begun
isabel
sat
in
the
living
room
trying
not
to
show
that
she
was
bored
the
colonel
had
come
in
ready
to
receive
her
into
his
house
and
his
heart
but
isabel
had
shaken
hands
with
him
coolly
and
accepted
shrinkingly
the
fatherly
kiss
he
stooped
to
bestow
upon
her
forehead
he
had
tried
several
preliminary
topics
of
conversation
which
had
been
met
with
chilling
monosyllables
so
he
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
subject
with
inward
trepidation
i
told
allison
this
morning
that
i
owed
him
my
thanks
for
bringing
me
a
daughter
yes
said
isabel
placidly
the
old
house
needs
young
voices
and
the
sound
of
young
feet
the
colonel
went
on
isabel
began
to
speak
then
hesitated
and
relapsed
into
silence
boffin
came
in
purring
loudly
and
rubbed
familiarly
against
the
colonel
leaving
a
thin
coating
of
yellow
hair
it
seems
to
be
the
moulting
season
for
cats
laughed
the
colonel
observing
the
damage
ruefully
isabel
moved
restlessly
in
her
chair
but
said
nothing
the
pause
had
become
awkward
when
the
colonel
rose
to
take
his
leave
i
hope
you
may
be
happy
he
said
gravely
and
make
our
old
house
happier
for
your
coming
oh
returned
isabel
quickly
i
had
thought
of
that
i
thought
of
of
living
there
the
house
is
large
he
ventured
puzzled
mamma
has
always
said
remarked
isabel
primly
that
no
house
was
large
enough
for
two
families
colonel
kent
managed
to
force
a
laugh
you
may
be
right
he
answered
at
least
everything
shall
be
arranged
to
your
liking
he
had
said
and
was
on
his
way
out
when
francesca
came
down
from
rose
room
seeing
her
he
waited
for
a
moment
isabel
had
gone
into
the
library
and
closed
the
door
whence
this
haste
queried
madame
with
a
lightness
which
was
just
then
difficult
to
assume
were
you
going
without
seeing
me
i
had
feared
i
would
be
obliged
to
he
returned
gallantly
i
was
calling
upon
my
future
he
added
in
a
low
tone
as
they
went
out
on
the
veranda
madame
sighed
and
sank
gratefully
into
the
chair
he
offered
her
in
the
broad
light
of
day
she
looked
old
and
worn
well
continued
the
colonel
with
an
effort
to
speak
cheerfully
the
blow
has
fallen
so
i
hear
she
rejoined
almost
in
a
whisper
what
tremendous
readjustments
the
heedless
young
may
cause
yes
but
we
must
deny
them
the
right
the
eternal
sacrifice
of
youth
to
age
is
one
of
the
most
pitiful
things
in
nature
human
nature
that
is
the
animals
know
better
would
you
remove
all
opportunity
for
the
development
of
character
she
inquired
with
a
tinge
of
sarcasm
no
but
i
would
deliberately
furnish
it
the
world
supplies
it
generously
enough
i
think
allison
did
ask
to
be
born
he
went
on
with
a
change
of
tone
and
those
who
brought
him
into
the
world
are
infinitely
more
responsible
to
him
than
he
is
to
them
returned
madame
abruptly
and
if
so
it
the
only
thing
that
is
what
of
the
gift
of
life
nothing
to
speak
of
he
responded
with
a
cynicism
wholly
new
to
her
i
would
go
back
and
live
it
over
would
you
no
she
sighed
i
would
i
do
believe
anyone
would
even
the
happiest
too
much
character
development
yes
she
admitted
with
a
shamefaced
flush
you
have
a
chance
to
see
now
it
will
be
right
under
your
nose
no
he
said
with
a
certain
sad
emphasis
which
did
not
escape
her
it
wo
i
shall
be
at
a
respectful
distance
why
richard
she
cried
half
rising
from
her
chair
what
do
you
mean
are
you
going
to
live
with
them
in
the
old
home
the
colonel
shook
his
head
why
she
demanded
the
colonel
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
in
a
mock
salute
orders
he
said
briefly
from
headquarters
has
allison
she
began
in
astonishment
but
he
interrupted
her
no
he
inclined
his
head
suggestively
toward
the
house
and
she
understood
the
little
brute
murmured
francesca
richard
believe
me
i
am
ashamed
do
bother
he
answered
kindly
the
boy
must
know
you
always
plan
everything
for
me
where
shall
i
live
now
she
leaned
forward
her
blue
eyes
shining
oh
richard
she
breathed
if
you
only
would
if
you
could
come
to
rose
and
me
we
be
so
glad
there
was
no
mistaking
her
sincerity
and
the
colonel
fine
old
face
illumined
with
pleasure
merely
to
be
wanted
anywhere
brings
a
certain
satisfaction
i
come
he
returned
promptly
how
good
you
are
how
good
always
been
i
often
wonder
what
i
should
ever
have
done
without
you
he
turned
away
and
lightly
as
a
passing
cloud
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
madame
saw
how
hard
it
would
be
to
part
from
his
son
and
only
in
lesser
degree
his
old
home
richard
she
said
a
ship
was
sinking
once
in
a
fog
miles
out
of
its
course
the
captain
ordered
the
band
to
play
and
all
the
officers
put
on
their
dress
uniforms
another
ship
also
drifting
signalled
in
answer
to
the
music
and
all
were
saved
the
colonel
rose
and
offered
his
hand
in
farewell
thank
you
francesca
he
answered
deeply
moved
i
put
on
my
white
gloves
the
day
you
came
to
tell
me
i
thank
you
now
for
the
signal
and
for
saving
me
she
watched
him
as
he
went
down
the
road
tall
erect
and
soldierly
in
spite
of
his
and
ten
three
of
us
she
said
to
herself
all
in
white
gloves
the
metaphor
appealed
to
her
strongly
she
did
not
go
in
until
isabel
appeared
in
the
doorway
list
in
hand
and
prettily
perplexed
over
the
problem
of
clothes
madame
slipped
it
into
the
chatelaine
bag
that
hung
from
her
belt
we
go
over
it
with
rose
she
said
she
knows
more
about
clothes
than
i
do
have
you
told
cousin
rose
no
answered
madame
avoiding
the
girl
eyes
it
your
place
to
tell
her
not
mine
when
rose
came
down
to
dinner
that
night
she
was
gorgeously
attired
in
her
gown
of
satin
adorned
with
gold
lace
the
last
yellow
roses
of
the
garden
were
twined
in
her
dark
hair
and
the
that
faithful
friend
of
unhappy
woman
had
given
a
little
needed
colour
to
her
cheeks
and
lips
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
cousin
rose
began
isabel
a
little
abashed
by
the
older
magnificence
i
engaged
to
allison
really
cried
rose
with
astonishment
come
here
and
let
me
kiss
the
you
must
make
him
very
happy
she
said
then
added
softly
i
pray
that
you
may
everybody
seems
to
think
of
him
and
not
of
me
isabel
returned
a
little
fretfully
that
what
aunt
francesca
said
and
allison
father
seemed
to
think
more
about
my
making
allison
happy
than
he
did
about
my
being
happy
myself
that
because
the
only
way
to
win
happiness
is
to
give
it
put
in
madame
the
more
we
give
the
more
we
have
conversation
lagged
at
dinner
and
became
as
often
a
monologue
by
madame
while
they
were
finishing
their
coffee
they
heard
step
outside
i
wonder
why
he
had
to
come
so
early
complained
isabel
i
wanted
to
change
my
dress
i
did
have
time
before
dinner
he
never
know
it
madame
assured
her
we
excuse
you
dear
if
you
through
do
keep
him
waiting
when
the
door
closed
rose
turned
to
madame
did
i
most
wonderfully
but
the
hardest
part
is
still
to
come
she
breathed
sadly
was
ever
a
fighter
so
one
fight
more
the
best
and
the
last
madame
quoted
encouragingly
rose
smiled
a
little
wan
smile
as
she
pushed
back
her
chair
perhaps
she
said
the
out
of
pain
may
follow
me
she
went
with
faltering
step
toward
the
other
room
inwardly
afraid
another
hand
met
hers
with
a
reassuring
clasp
one
step
more
rose
now
then
forward
march
all
flags
unfurled
when
she
went
in
allison
came
to
meet
her
with
outstretched
hands
he
had
changed
subtly
since
she
saw
him
last
had
light
been
poured
over
him
it
would
have
changed
him
in
much
the
same
way
golden
rose
he
said
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
tell
me
you
are
glad
say
that
you
wish
me
joy
her
eyes
met
his
clearly
i
do
she
smiled
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
for
whom
i
wish
joy
more
than
i
do
for
you
and
i
say
the
same
chimed
in
madame
who
had
closely
followed
rose
dear
little
foster
mother
said
allison
tenderly
putting
a
strong
arm
around
her
he
had
not
yet
released
rose
hand
nor
did
he
note
that
it
was
growing
cold
i
owe
you
everything
he
went
on
even
isabel
he
kissed
her
then
laughing
turned
to
rose
may
i
he
asked
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
turned
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
cold
as
ice
and
shaken
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
rose
stumbled
out
of
the
room
murmuring
brokenly
of
a
forgotten
letter
which
must
be
immediately
written
madame
lingered
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
talking
brightly
of
everything
under
the
sun
then
followed
rose
turning
in
the
doorway
as
she
went
out
to
say
ca
you
even
thank
me
for
leaving
you
alone
bless
her
said
allison
fondly
what
sweet
women
they
are
yes
answered
isabel
spitefully
especially
rose
he
laughed
heartily
what
a
little
goose
you
are
sweetheart
kiss
me
dear
dearest
i
wo
she
flashed
back
stubbornly
nor
would
she
until
at
last
by
superior
strength
he
took
his
lover
privilege
from
lips
that
refused
to
yield
that
night
he
dreamed
that
for
a
single
exquisite
instant
isabel
had
answered
him
giving
him
love
for
love
then
strangely
enough
isabel
became
rose
in
a
gown
of
gold
with
golden
roses
twined
in
her
hair
xiv
the
thirtieth
of
june
dinner
that
night
had
been
rather
a
silent
affair
at
kent
as
well
as
at
madame
bernard
being
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
allison
did
not
realise
how
unsociable
he
was
nor
that
the
old
man
across
the
table
from
him
perceived
that
they
had
reached
the
beginning
of
the
end
when
allison
spoke
it
was
always
of
isabel
idealised
in
her
sight
she
stood
before
him
as
the
one
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
predestined
through
countless
ages
to
be
his
mate
colonel
kent
merely
agreed
with
him
in
monosyllables
until
allison
became
conscious
that
his
father
did
not
wholly
share
his
enthusiasm
i
wish
you
knew
her
dad
he
said
regretfully
you
love
her
when
you
do
i
willing
to
answered
the
colonel
shortly
i
called
on
her
this
afternoon
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
allison
face
illumined
was
she
there
did
you
see
her
yes
is
she
the
loveliest
thing
that
was
ever
made
i
not
prepared
to
go
as
far
as
that
smiled
the
colonel
but
she
is
certainly
a
very
pretty
girl
she
beautiful
returned
allison
with
deep
conviction
the
colonel
forebore
to
remind
him
that
love
brings
beauty
with
it
or
that
the
beauty
which
endures
comes
from
the
soul
within
just
think
dad
allison
was
saying
how
lovely
she
be
at
that
end
of
the
table
with
me
across
from
her
and
you
at
her
right
the
colonel
shook
his
head
then
cleared
his
throat
not
always
lad
he
said
kindly
but
perhaps
sometimes
as
a
guest
allison
fork
dropped
with
a
sharp
clatter
on
his
plate
dad
what
do
you
mean
no
house
is
large
enough
for
two
families
repeated
the
colonel
with
an
unconscious
accent
why
dad
we
always
stood
together
surely
you
wo
desert
me
now
the
old
man
eyes
softened
with
mist
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
meet
the
clear
questioning
gaze
of
his
son
i
ca
understand
allison
went
on
doubtfully
is
it
possible
could
no
said
the
colonel
firmly
still
avoiding
the
questioning
eyes
she
did
of
course
she
did
returned
allison
fully
satisfied
she
could
she
not
that
kind
what
a
brute
i
was
even
to
think
it
but
why
dad
please
tell
me
why
francesca
asked
me
this
afternoon
if
i
would
come
to
her
and
rose
after
the
afterwards
you
know
and
i
promised
if
you
promised
i
suppose
that
settles
it
remarked
allison
gloomily
but
i
wish
you
had
i
can
understand
that
they
would
want
you
too
for
of
course
they
be
desperately
lonely
after
isabel
goes
away
a
certain
peace
crept
into
the
old
man
sore
heart
surely
there
was
something
to
live
for
still
i
hope
you
did
tell
aunt
francesca
you
stay
there
always
allison
was
saying
anxiously
no
answered
the
colonel
with
a
smile
there
was
no
limit
specified
then
we
consider
it
only
a
visit
and
a
short
one
at
that
just
until
they
get
a
little
used
to
isabel
being
away
this
is
your
rightful
place
dad
and
isabel
and
i
both
want
you
do
ever
forget
that
when
allison
had
gone
in
search
of
his
beloved
the
colonel
sat
on
the
veranda
alone
accustomed
now
to
evenings
spent
thus
his
garden
promised
well
he
thought
having
produced
two
or
three
sickly
roses
in
the
very
first
season
the
shrubs
and
trees
that
had
survived
ten
years
of
neglect
had
been
pruned
and
tied
and
would
doubtless
do
well
next
year
if
isabel
i
hope
he
never
find
out
the
colonel
said
to
himself
then
he
remembered
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
lied
to
his
son
and
took
occasion
to
observe
the
highly
spectacular
effect
of
an
untruth
from
an
habitually
truthful
person
he
never
doubted
me
not
for
an
instant
mused
the
colonel
but
just
as
well
that
i
going
she
could
probably
manage
it
if
we
lived
in
the
same
house
so
that
i
have
to
tell
at
least
one
lie
a
day
and
i
not
an
expert
perfection
might
come
with
practice
i
known
it
to
but
i
too
old
to
begin
he
was
deeply
grateful
to
francesca
for
her
solution
of
the
problem
that
confronted
him
it
had
appeared
and
been
duly
solved
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
she
had
been
his
good
angel
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
might
be
very
pleasant
to
live
there
after
he
became
accustomed
to
the
change
and
with
allison
so
near
why
he
could
be
half
as
lonely
as
he
was
now
so
his
thoughts
drifted
into
a
happier
channel
and
he
was
actually
humming
an
old
song
to
himself
when
he
heard
allison
step
almost
at
midnight
on
the
road
just
beyond
the
gate
he
went
in
quietly
closed
the
door
and
was
in
his
own
room
when
allison
rattled
in
the
lock
the
colonel
took
pains
not
to
be
heard
moving
about
but
it
was
unnecessary
for
allison
heart
was
beating
in
time
with
its
own
music
and
surging
with
the
nameless
rapture
that
comes
but
once
down
in
the
garden
allison
waited
for
isabel
as
the
first
man
might
have
waited
for
the
first
woman
in
another
garden
countless
ages
ago
stars
were
mirrored
in
the
the
waning
moon
swung
low
the
roses
had
gone
except
a
few
of
the
blooming
sort
but
the
memory
of
their
fragrance
lingered
still
in
the
velvet
dusk
no
music
came
from
the
quiet
house
for
rose
had
not
touched
the
piano
since
that
night
it
stood
out
in
his
remembrance
in
capitals
as
it
did
in
hers
for
widely
different
reasons
only
isabel
cherishing
no
foolish
sentiment
as
to
dates
and
places
could
have
forgotten
that
night
with
a
lover
fond
fancy
allison
had
written
a
note
to
isabel
asking
her
to
meet
him
in
the
garden
by
the
at
nine
and
to
wear
the
gown
it
was
already
past
the
hour
and
he
had
begun
to
be
impatient
though
he
was
sure
she
had
received
the
note
a
cobweb
in
the
grass
at
his
feet
shone
faintly
afar
like
spangles
he
thought
a
wayfarer
of
the
night
brushed
lightly
against
his
cheek
in
passing
and
he
laughed
aloud
to
think
that
a
grey
moth
should
bring
the
memory
of
a
kiss
then
with
a
swift
sinking
of
the
heart
he
remembered
isabel
unvarying
coldness
never
for
an
instant
had
she
answered
him
as
rose
nonsense
he
muttered
to
himself
angrily
what
an
unspeakable
cad
i
am
there
was
a
light
step
on
the
path
and
isabel
appeared
out
of
the
shadows
she
was
holding
up
her
skirts
and
seemed
annoyed
in
the
first
glance
allison
noted
that
she
was
not
wearing
the
spangled
gown
she
submitted
to
his
eager
embrace
and
endured
his
kiss
even
the
blindest
lover
could
not
have
said
more
yet
her
coldness
only
thrilled
him
to
the
depths
with
love
of
her
as
has
been
the
way
of
men
since
the
world
began
i
do
understand
this
foolishness
she
said
fretfully
as
she
released
herself
from
his
encircling
arm
it
damp
and
chilly
out
here
and
i
get
wet
and
take
cold
it
is
damp
darling
and
you
ca
take
cold
why
did
you
wear
the
spangles
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
spoil
my
best
gown
dragging
it
through
the
wet
grass
the
grass
is
wet
and
anyhow
you
have
been
on
it
only
on
the
path
come
over
here
to
the
bench
and
sit
down
i
do
want
to
i
want
to
go
in
all
right
but
not
just
yet
i
carry
you
if
you
afraid
of
dampness
before
she
could
protest
he
had
picked
her
up
and
laughingly
seated
her
on
the
bench
at
the
edge
of
the
isabel
smoothed
her
rumpled
hair
you
mussed
me
all
up
she
complained
why
ca
we
go
in
aunt
francesca
and
rose
are
upstairs
listen
sweetheart
please
be
patient
with
me
just
a
minute
wo
you
i
brought
you
your
engagement
ring
oh
cried
isabel
delightedly
let
me
see
it
i
want
to
tell
you
about
it
first
you
remember
do
you
that
the
first
night
i
came
here
you
were
wearing
a
big
silver
pin
a
turquoise
matrix
set
in
dull
silver
i
forgotten
well
i
have
someway
it
seemed
to
suit
you
as
jewels
seldom
suit
anybody
and
you
had
it
on
the
other
night
when
you
promised
to
marry
me
both
times
you
were
wearing
the
spangled
gown
and
that
why
i
asked
for
it
and
why
i
had
your
engagement
ring
made
of
a
turquoise
isabel
murmured
inarticulately
but
he
went
on
heedlessly
it
made
of
silver
because
you
my
silver
girl
the
design
is
all
roses
because
it
was
in
the
time
of
roses
and
it
a
turquoise
for
reasons
i
told
you
our
initials
and
the
date
are
inside
allison
slipped
it
on
her
finger
and
struck
a
match
that
she
might
see
it
plainly
isabel
turned
it
on
her
finger
listlessly
very
pretty
she
said
in
a
small
thin
voice
after
an
awkward
pause
why
dearest
he
cried
do
you
like
it
it
well
enough
she
answered
slowly
but
not
for
an
engagement
ring
everybody
else
has
diamonds
i
thought
you
cared
enough
for
me
to
give
me
a
diamond
she
said
reproachfully
i
do
he
assured
her
and
you
shall
have
diamonds
as
many
as
i
can
give
you
why
sweet
this
is
only
the
beginning
there
a
long
life
ahead
of
us
is
there
do
you
think
i
never
going
to
give
my
wife
any
jewels
aunt
francesca
and
rose
put
you
up
to
this
said
isabel
bitterly
they
never
want
me
to
have
anything
they
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
he
replied
rather
coldly
taking
it
from
her
finger
as
he
spoke
listen
isabel
would
you
rather
have
a
diamond
in
your
engagement
ring
of
course
i
be
ashamed
to
have
anybody
know
that
this
was
my
engagement
ring
all
right
said
allison
with
defiant
cheerfulness
you
shall
have
just
exactly
what
you
want
and
to
make
sure
i
take
you
with
me
when
i
go
to
get
it
i
sorry
i
made
such
a
mistake
there
was
a
flash
of
blue
and
silver
in
the
faint
light
and
a
soft
splash
in
the
there
he
went
on
it
out
of
your
way
now
you
did
need
to
throw
it
away
she
said
icily
i
did
say
i
did
want
it
nor
that
i
would
wear
it
i
only
said
i
wanted
a
diamond
it
could
be
found
i
suppose
he
replied
thoughtfully
ashamed
of
his
momentary
impulse
if
the
pool
were
drained
that
would
cost
more
than
the
ring
is
worth
isabel
interrupted
come
let
go
in
he
was
about
to
explain
that
a
very
pool
could
be
drained
for
the
price
of
the
ring
but
fortunately
thought
better
of
it
and
was
bitterly
glad
now
that
he
had
thrown
it
away
in
the
house
they
talked
of
other
things
but
the
thrust
still
lingered
in
his
consciousness
unforgotten
how
your
father
inquired
isabel
in
a
conversational
pause
as
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
all
right
i
guess
why
i
have
seen
him
lately
he
has
been
over
since
the
day
he
called
on
me
guess
i
have
thought
to
ask
him
to
come
along
dad
is
possessed
just
at
present
by
a
very
foolish
idea
they
told
you
have
they
no
told
me
what
why
that
after
we
carried
he
to
come
over
here
to
live
with
aunt
francesca
and
rose
and
give
us
the
house
to
ourselves
i
had
heard
she
replied
indifferently
i
do
know
when
i
felt
so
badly
about
anything
allison
resumed
we
always
been
together
and
we
been
more
like
two
chums
than
father
and
son
it
like
taking
my
best
friend
away
from
me
but
i
know
he
come
back
to
us
if
you
ask
him
to
probably
she
assented
coldly
i
suppose
we
be
in
town
for
the
winters
wo
we
and
only
live
here
in
the
summer
i
do
know
dear
we
see
i
got
to
go
to
see
my
manager
very
soon
and
dad
asked
me
to
find
out
what
you
wanted
for
a
wedding
present
i
to
help
him
select
it
can
i
have
anything
i
choose
she
queried
keenly
interested
now
anything
within
reason
he
smiled
i
sorry
we
not
millionaires
could
i
have
an
automobile
perhaps
what
kind
a
big
red
touring
car
with
room
for
four
or
five
people
in
it
i
tell
him
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
have
one
would
it
indeed
it
would
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
oh
allison
do
persuade
him
to
get
it
wo
you
i
wo
have
to
if
he
can
i
never
had
to
persuade
my
father
into
anything
he
could
do
for
me
when
he
went
home
isabel
kissed
him
of
her
own
accord
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
cold
little
kiss
accompanied
with
a
whispered
plea
for
the
red
automobile
but
it
set
his
heart
to
thumping
wildly
and
made
him
forget
the
disdained
turquoise
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
within
a
few
days
isabel
was
the
happy
possessor
of
an
engagement
ring
with
a
diamond
in
it
a
larger
brighter
stone
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
having
colonel
kent
had
also
readily
promised
the
automobile
though
he
did
not
tell
allison
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
sell
some
property
in
order
to
acquire
a
really
fine
car
it
took
until
the
end
of
the
month
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
thirtieth
a
trumpeting
red
monster
bright
with
brass
drew
up
before
the
kent
door
having
come
out
from
town
on
its
own
power
as
the
two
men
had
taken
a
brief
tour
over
the
wonderful
roads
of
france
with
allison
at
the
wheel
he
felt
no
hesitation
in
trying
an
unfamiliar
car
the
old
throb
of
exultation
came
back
when
the
monster
responded
to
his
touch
and
chugged
out
of
the
driveway
on
its
lowest
speed
he
turned
back
to
wave
his
hand
at
his
father
who
stood
smiling
on
the
veranda
with
the
chauffeur
beside
him
i
get
isabel
he
called
then
come
back
for
you
he
reached
madame
bernard
without
accident
and
isabel
almost
wild
with
joy
ran
out
of
the
gate
to
meet
him
and
climbed
in
only
rose
from
the
shelter
of
her
curtains
saw
them
as
they
went
away
where
shall
we
go
isabel
asked
she
was
hatless
and
the
sun
dwelt
lovingly
upon
her
shining
black
hair
back
for
dad
he
waiting
for
us
do
you
like
it
dear
indeed
i
do
oh
so
much
it
was
lovely
of
him
was
it
he
care
would
he
if
we
took
a
little
ride
just
by
ourselves
before
we
went
back
for
him
of
course
not
but
we
ca
go
far
and
we
have
to
go
fast
i
love
to
go
fast
i
never
been
fast
enough
yet
i
wonder
if
the
crosbys
have
got
their
automobile
i
heard
so
but
i
have
seen
it
i
understand
that
romeo
is
learning
to
drive
it
in
the
narrow
boundaries
of
the
yard
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
the
thirtieth
there
less
than
three
months
to
wait
now
darling
then
you
be
mine
all
mine
then
this
is
the
day
the
crosbys
were
going
to
celebrate
it
the
anniversary
of
their
uncle
death
i
glad
we
got
our
automobile
ca
we
go
by
there
it
only
three
miles
and
i
love
to
have
them
see
us
go
by
at
full
speed
obediently
allison
turned
into
the
winding
road
which
led
to
and
to
please
isabel
drove
at
the
third
speed
once
under
way
the
road
spun
dustily
backward
under
the
purring
car
and
the
wind
in
their
faces
felt
like
the
current
of
a
stream
oh
cried
isabel
rapturously
is
it
lovely
i
almost
afraid
to
go
so
fast
dear
if
there
should
be
another
car
on
this
road
we
might
collide
at
some
of
these
sharp
turns
but
there
is
there
not
another
automobile
in
this
sleepy
little
town
except
the
crosbys
it
is
likely
that
they
out
in
theirs
now
on
this
road
but
as
it
happened
they
were
after
some
difficulties
at
the
start
romeo
had
engineered
the
yellow
peril
out
through
a
large
break
in
the
fence
the
twins
wore
their
brown
suits
with
tan
leather
trimmings
and
as
planned
long
ago
the
back
seat
of
the
machine
was
partially
filled
with
raw
meat
of
the
sort
most
liked
by
romeo
canine
dependents
two
yellow
flags
fluttered
from
the
back
of
the
driver
seat
one
had
the
initials
in
black
on
the
other
in
red
was
the
yellow
peril
the
name
of
the
machine
and
the
monogram
were
strikingly
in
evidence
on
the
doors
and
at
the
back
where
a
choice
cut
of
roast
beef
uncooked
dangled
temptingly
by
a
strong
cord
just
before
they
started
juliet
unfastened
the
barn
door
and
freed
nineteen
starving
dogs
all
in
collars
suited
to
the
general
colour
scheme
of
the
automobile
and
bearing
the
initials
when
they
sniffed
the
grateful
odour
borne
on
the
warm
june
wind
they
plunged
after
the
machine
with
howls
and
yelps
of
delight
only
minerva
remained
behind
having
five
new
puppies
to
care
for
oh
romie
romie
shouted
juliet
in
ecstasy
they
coming
see
romeo
looked
back
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
saw
that
they
were
indeed
coming
and
then
discovered
that
he
had
lost
control
of
the
machine
sit
tight
he
said
to
juliet
between
clenched
teeth
i
am
she
screamed
gleefully
oh
romie
if
uncle
could
only
see
us
now
uncle
likely
to
see
us
very
soon
retorted
romeo
grimly
unless
i
can
keep
her
on
the
road
but
juliet
was
absorbed
in
the
joy
of
the
moment
and
did
not
hear
a
cloud
of
dust
through
which
gleamed
brass
and
red
appeared
on
the
road
ahead
of
them
having
rounded
the
curve
at
high
speed
at
the
same
instant
allison
saw
just
beyond
him
the
screaming
fantasy
of
colour
and
sound
jump
he
cried
to
isabel
jump
for
your
life
she
immediately
obeyed
him
falling
in
a
little
white
heap
at
the
roadside
he
rose
headed
the
machine
toward
the
ditch
at
the
right
and
jumped
to
the
left
falling
face
down
in
the
road
with
his
hands
outstretched
before
he
could
stir
the
other
machine
roared
heavily
over
him
grazing
his
left
hand
and
crushing
it
into
the
deep
dust
there
was
almost
an
instant
of
unbelievable
agony
then
mercifully
darkness
and
oblivion
xv
how
she
will
come
to
me
the
darkness
swayed
but
did
not
lift
there
was
a
strange
rhythm
in
its
movement
as
though
it
were
the
sea
but
there
was
no
sound
black
shadows
crept
upon
him
then
slowly
ebbed
away
at
times
he
was
part
of
the
darkness
at
others
separate
from
it
yet
lying
upon
it
and
wholly
sustained
by
it
at
intervals
the
swaying
movement
changed
his
feet
sank
slowly
in
distinct
pulsations
until
he
stood
almost
upright
then
his
head
began
to
sink
and
his
feet
to
rise
when
his
head
was
far
down
and
his
feet
almost
directly
above
him
the
motion
changed
again
and
he
came
back
gradually
to
the
horizontal
sinking
back
with
one
and
rising
with
the
next
always
a
little
higher
how
still
it
was
the
silence
of
eternity
was
in
that
all
compassing
dark
which
reached
to
the
uttermost
boundaries
of
space
it
was
hollow
and
empty
save
for
him
rising
and
falling
rising
and
falling
in
a
series
of
regular
movements
corresponding
almost
exactly
to
the
ticking
of
a
watch
a
faint
sickening
odour
crept
through
the
darkness
followed
by
a
black
overwhelming
shadow
which
threatened
to
engulf
him
in
its
depths
still
swaying
he
waited
for
it
calmly
all
at
once
it
was
upon
him
but
swiftly
receded
he
seemed
to
sway
backward
out
of
it
and
as
he
looked
back
upon
it
gathering
its
forces
for
another
attack
he
saw
that
it
was
different
from
the
darkness
upon
which
he
lay
that
instead
of
black
it
was
a
deep
purple
the
odour
persisted
and
almost
nauseated
him
it
was
vaguely
familiar
though
he
had
never
before
come
into
intimate
contact
with
it
was
it
the
purple
shadow
that
ebbed
and
flowed
so
strangely
upon
his
dark
horizon
growing
to
a
brighter
purple
with
each
movement
the
purple
grew
very
bright
then
deepened
to
blue
almost
black
dancing
tongues
of
flame
shot
through
the
darkness
as
he
swung
through
it
up
and
down
like
a
ship
moved
by
a
heavy
ground
swell
the
flames
took
colour
and
increased
in
number
violet
orange
blue
green
and
yellow
flickered
for
an
instant
then
disappeared
the
darkness
was
not
quite
so
heavy
but
it
still
swayed
the
javelins
of
flame
shot
through
it
continually
making
a
web
of
iridescence
then
the
purple
shadow
approached
majestically
and
put
them
out
when
it
retreated
they
came
again
but
the
colour
was
fainter
the
yellow
flames
darted
toward
him
from
every
conceivable
direction
stabbing
him
like
needles
in
this
light
the
purple
shadow
changed
to
blue
and
began
to
grow
brighter
the
sickening
odour
was
so
strong
now
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
the
blue
shadow
warred
with
the
yellow
flames
but
could
not
put
them
out
he
saw
now
that
the
shadow
was
his
friend
and
the
flames
were
a
host
of
enemies
all
the
little
stabbing
lights
suddenly
merged
into
one
he
was
surrounded
by
fire
that
burned
him
as
he
swayed
back
and
forth
and
the
cool
shadows
were
gone
the
light
grew
intense
and
terrible
but
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
to
shade
his
eyes
slowly
the
orange
deepened
to
scarlet
in
which
he
spun
around
giddily
among
myriads
of
disks
the
scarlet
grew
brighter
and
brighter
until
it
became
a
white
streaming
light
all
at
once
the
swaying
stopped
the
intensity
of
the
white
light
was
agreeably
tempered
by
a
grey
mist
through
the
vapour
he
saw
the
outlines
of
his
own
chiffonier
across
the
room
a
woman
in
spotless
white
moved
noiselessly
about
even
though
she
did
not
look
at
him
he
felt
a
certain
friendliness
toward
her
she
seemed
to
have
been
with
him
while
he
swayed
through
the
shadow
and
it
was
pleasant
to
know
that
he
had
not
been
alone
on
the
table
near
the
window
his
violin
lay
as
he
had
left
it
the
case
was
standing
in
a
corner
and
his
music
stand
had
toppled
over
the
torn
sheets
of
music
rustled
idly
on
the
floor
and
he
wondered
fretfully
why
the
woman
in
white
did
not
pick
them
up
as
if
in
answer
to
his
thought
she
stooped
and
gathered
them
together
quietly
sorting
the
pages
and
putting
them
into
the
open
drawer
that
held
his
music
she
closed
the
drawer
and
folded
up
his
music
stand
without
making
a
sound
she
seemed
far
removed
from
him
like
someone
from
another
world
cloud
surrounded
her
but
he
caught
glimpses
of
her
through
it
occasionally
she
took
up
his
violin
very
carefully
put
it
into
its
case
and
carried
it
out
of
the
room
he
did
not
care
very
much
but
it
seemed
rather
an
impolite
thing
to
do
he
knew
that
he
would
not
have
stolen
a
violin
when
the
owner
was
in
the
same
room
soon
she
came
back
and
he
was
reassured
she
had
not
stolen
it
after
all
she
might
have
broken
it
for
she
seemed
to
feel
very
sorry
about
something
she
was
wiping
her
eyes
with
a
bit
of
white
as
women
always
did
when
they
cried
it
was
not
necessary
for
her
to
cry
on
account
of
one
broken
violin
for
he
had
thousands
of
them
stradivarius
amati
cremona
everything
some
of
them
were
highly
coloured
and
very
rare
on
that
account
he
had
only
to
go
to
his
storehouse
present
a
ticket
and
choose
whatever
he
liked
red
green
yellow
or
even
striped
everybody
who
played
the
violin
needed
a
great
many
of
them
for
the
different
moods
of
music
it
was
obvious
that
the
dark
brown
violin
with
which
he
played
slow
sad
music
could
not
be
used
for
the
hungarian
dances
he
had
a
special
violin
for
those
striped
with
barbaric
colour
the
woman
who
had
broken
one
of
his
violins
stood
at
the
window
with
her
back
toward
him
her
shoulders
shook
and
from
time
to
time
she
lifted
the
bit
of
white
to
her
eyes
it
was
annoying
he
thought
even
worse
than
the
shadows
and
the
fire
he
was
about
to
call
to
her
and
suggest
ironically
that
she
had
cried
enough
and
that
the
flowers
would
be
spoiled
if
they
got
too
wet
when
someone
called
from
the
next
room
miss
rose
she
turned
quickly
wiped
her
eyes
once
more
and
without
making
a
sound
went
out
on
the
white
cloud
that
surrounded
her
half
way
to
her
waist
he
tried
to
change
his
position
a
little
and
felt
his
own
bed
under
him
his
body
was
stiff
and
sore
but
he
had
the
use
of
it
except
his
left
arm
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
move
it
for
it
was
weighted
down
and
it
hurt
terribly
miss
rose
miss
rose
miss
rose
miss
rose
the
words
beat
hard
in
his
ears
like
a
clock
ticking
loudly
the
accent
was
on
the
miss
the
last
word
was
much
fainter
rose
miss
was
wrong
so
the
other
must
be
right
except
for
the
misplaced
accent
did
the
accent
always
come
on
the
first
beat
of
a
measure
he
had
forgotten
but
he
would
ask
the
man
at
the
storehouse
when
he
went
to
get
the
striped
violin
for
the
hungarian
dances
his
left
hand
throbbed
with
unbearable
agony
the
room
began
to
spin
slowly
on
its
axis
there
was
no
mist
now
or
even
a
shadow
and
every
sense
was
abnormally
acute
the
objects
in
the
whirling
room
were
phenomenally
clear
even
a
scratch
on
the
front
of
his
chiffonier
stood
out
distinctly
he
could
hear
a
clock
ticking
though
there
was
no
clock
in
his
room
afar
was
the
sound
of
women
sobbing
two
of
them
above
it
a
strange
voice
said
distinctly
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
thousand
of
saving
his
hand
if
i
had
nurses
i
would
amputate
now
before
he
recovers
consciousness
the
words
struck
him
with
the
force
of
a
blow
though
he
did
not
fully
realise
what
they
meant
the
pain
in
his
left
arm
and
the
sickening
odour
nauseated
him
the
cool
black
shadow
drowned
the
objects
in
the
room
and
crept
upon
him
stealthily
presently
he
was
swaying
again
up
and
down
up
and
down
in
the
dark
so
it
happened
that
he
did
not
hear
colonel
kent
ringing
answer
you
shall
not
amputate
until
every
great
surgeon
in
the
united
states
has
said
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
i
leave
on
the
next
train
and
shall
send
them
and
keep
on
sending
until
there
are
no
more
to
send
until
a
man
comes
who
thinks
there
is
a
chance
of
saving
it
you
are
in
charge
after
that
it
is
his
case
day
by
day
a
continuous
procession
came
to
the
big
colonial
house
allison
became
accustomed
to
the
weary
round
of
darkness
pain
sickening
odours
strange
faces
darkness
and
so
on
endlessly
without
pity
or
pause
the
woman
in
white
had
mysteriously
vanished
in
her
place
were
two
in
blue
and
white
with
queer
unbecoming
caps
they
were
there
one
at
a
time
always
never
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
were
they
together
when
the
fierce
hot
agony
became
unendurable
for
even
a
moment
longer
one
of
them
would
lean
over
him
with
a
bit
of
shining
silver
in
her
hand
and
stab
him
sharply
for
an
instant
then
with
incredible
quickness
came
peace
once
when
two
strange
men
had
come
together
and
had
gone
into
the
adjoining
room
he
caught
disconnected
fragments
of
conversation
not
much
longer
interesting
case
he
wondered
as
he
began
to
sway
in
the
darkness
again
what
hypersensitive
meant
surely
he
used
to
know
still
it
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
now
in
the
brief
intervals
of
consciousness
he
began
to
wonder
what
he
had
been
doing
just
before
this
happened
whatever
it
was
it
took
him
days
to
piece
out
the
disconnected
memories
past
the
whirling
room
the
woman
in
white
and
the
creeping
shadows
to
the
red
touring
car
and
isabel
his
heart
throbbed
painfully
held
though
it
was
by
some
iron
hand
icy
cold
in
a
pitiless
clutch
weakly
he
summoned
the
blue
and
white
woman
who
sat
in
a
low
chair
across
his
room
she
came
quickly
and
put
her
ear
very
close
to
his
lips
that
she
might
hear
what
he
said
was
she
hurt
no
said
the
blue
and
white
woman
very
kindly
only
slightly
bruised
the
next
day
he
summoned
her
again
as
before
she
bent
very
low
to
catch
the
gasping
words
where
father
he
had
to
go
to
town
on
business
he
will
come
back
just
as
soon
as
he
can
dead
said
allison
with
difficulty
nothing
else
could
now
no
she
assured
him
you
must
believe
me
he
all
right
everybody
else
is
all
right
and
we
hope
you
soon
will
be
no
use
talking
of
it
he
breathed
hoarsely
i
know
singly
by
twos
and
even
threes
the
strange
men
continued
to
come
from
the
city
allison
submitted
wearily
to
the
painful
examinations
that
seemed
so
unnecessary
some
of
the
men
seemed
kind
even
sympathetic
others
were
cold
and
impassive
like
so
many
machines
still
others
and
these
were
in
the
majority
were
almost
brutal
it
was
one
of
the
latter
sort
who
one
day
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
side
of
the
bed
with
a
scraping
noise
that
made
the
recumbent
figure
quiver
from
head
to
foot
the
man
face
was
almost
colourless
his
bulging
blue
eyes
were
cold
and
distorted
even
more
by
the
strong
lenses
of
his
spectacles
better
have
it
over
with
he
suggested
i
can
do
it
now
do
what
asked
allison
with
difficulty
amputate
your
hand
there
no
chance
the
blue
and
white
young
woman
then
on
duty
came
forward
i
beg
your
pardon
doctor
but
colonel
kent
left
strict
orders
not
to
operate
without
his
consent
the
strange
man
disdained
to
answer
the
nurse
but
turned
to
allison
again
do
you
know
where
your
father
can
be
reached
by
wire
my
father
is
dead
allison
insisted
he
closed
his
eyes
and
would
answer
no
more
questions
in
the
next
room
he
heard
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
talking
in
low
tones
that
did
not
carry
only
one
word
rose
above
the
murmur
delusion
allison
repeated
it
to
himself
as
he
sank
into
the
darkness
again
wondering
what
it
meant
and
of
whom
they
were
speaking
slowly
he
recovered
from
the
profound
shock
but
his
hand
did
not
improve
he
had
an
idea
that
the
ceaseless
bandaging
and
unbandaging
were
dangerous
as
well
as
painful
but
said
nothing
he
knew
that
his
career
had
come
to
its
end
before
it
had
really
begun
but
it
did
not
seem
to
affect
him
in
any
way
he
considered
it
unemotionally
and
impersonally
when
he
thought
of
it
at
all
two
more
men
came
together
one
was
brutal
the
other
merely
cold
they
shook
their
heads
and
went
away
a
few
days
later
a
man
of
the
rare
sort
came
a
gentle
kindly
sympathetic
soul
who
seemed
human
and
real
after
the
examination
was
finished
allison
asked
briefly
any
chance
the
kindly
man
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
told
the
truth
afraid
not
the
nurse
happened
to
be
out
of
the
room
none
the
less
allison
motioned
to
him
to
come
closer
almost
in
a
whisper
he
said
can
you
give
me
anything
that
will
make
me
strong
enough
to
write
half
a
dozen
lines
could
no
one
else
write
it
for
you
no
one
could
i
take
the
message
could
anyone
take
a
message
for
me
to
the
girl
i
was
going
to
marry
now
i
understand
said
the
other
gently
we
see
you
must
make
it
very
brief
when
the
nurse
came
back
they
gave
him
a
pencil
propped
a
book
up
before
him
and
fastened
a
sheet
of
paper
to
it
by
a
rubber
band
after
the
powerful
stimulant
the
doctor
administered
had
begun
to
take
effect
allison
managed
to
write
in
a
very
shaky
almost
illegible
hand
my
dearest
my
left
hand
will
have
to
come
off
as
i
ca
ask
you
to
marry
a
cripple
the
only
honourable
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
release
you
from
our
engagement
do
think
i
blame
you
darling
and
may
god
bless
you
the
effort
exhausted
him
greatly
but
the
thing
was
done
the
nurse
folded
it
put
it
into
an
envelope
sealed
it
and
took
the
pencil
from
him
you
let
me
address
it
wo
you
she
asked
yes
miss
isabel
ross
anyone
in
the
house
can
tell
you
where
anyone
will
take
it
to
her
thank
you
he
added
speaking
to
the
doctor
that
night
for
the
first
time
the
situation
began
to
affect
him
personally
in
the
hours
after
midnight
as
the
forces
of
the
physical
body
ebbed
toward
the
lowest
point
those
of
the
mind
seemed
to
increase
staring
at
the
low
night
light
that
by
its
feeble
flicker
exorcised
the
thousand
phantoms
that
beset
him
he
could
think
clearly
in
a
rocking
chair
across
the
room
the
night
nurse
dozed
with
a
white
shawl
wrapped
around
her
he
could
hear
her
deep
regular
breathing
as
she
slept
his
father
was
dead
he
knew
that
for
an
absolute
fact
and
wondered
why
the
two
kind
women
and
the
endless
varying
procession
of
men
should
so
persistently
lie
to
him
about
this
when
they
were
willing
to
tell
him
the
truth
about
everything
else
he
also
knew
that
sooner
or
later
his
left
hand
would
be
amputated
and
that
his
career
would
come
to
an
inglorious
end
indeed
the
end
had
already
come
the
ordeal
painfully
shadowed
upon
his
horizon
was
only
the
final
seal
fortunately
there
was
money
enough
for
everything
he
would
want
pitifully
little
for
the
rest
of
his
life
his
life
stretched
out
before
him
in
a
waste
of
empty
years
he
was
thirty
now
and
his
father
had
lived
until
well
past
seventy
might
have
lived
many
years
more
had
he
not
died
when
his
heart
broke
over
the
misfortunes
of
his
idolised
son
he
could
remember
the
rumble
of
the
carriage
wheels
the
night
of
the
funeral
the
nurse
had
dozed
in
her
chair
just
as
she
was
dozing
now
while
downstairs
they
carried
his
father
out
of
the
house
in
a
black
casket
and
buried
him
it
was
all
as
clear
as
though
it
had
happened
yesterday
instead
of
ages
ago
a
clock
somewhere
near
by
chimed
three
quick
silvery
strokes
with
the
last
stroke
the
clock
in
the
kitchen
struck
three
also
in
a
different
tone
and
with
an
annoying
briskness
of
manner
as
the
echo
died
away
the
old
grandfather
clock
on
the
landing
boomed
out
three
portentously
solemn
chimes
it
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
cheery
impertinent
little
clock
insisting
that
it
was
four
and
almost
time
for
sunrise
the
nurse
stirred
in
her
chair
yawned
and
came
over
to
the
bed
she
straightened
the
blankets
with
a
practised
hand
changed
his
hot
pillow
for
a
fresh
one
brought
him
a
drink
of
cool
water
and
went
back
to
her
chair
without
having
said
a
word
the
gentle
ministry
comforted
him
insensibly
what
magic
there
was
in
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
but
in
the
long
grey
years
ahead
there
would
be
no
woman
unless
isabel
sometime
that
afternoon
or
early
in
the
evening
she
had
received
his
note
it
was
not
strange
that
they
had
not
allowed
her
to
come
to
see
him
because
no
one
had
seen
him
but
the
doctors
and
nurses
even
aunt
francesca
whom
he
had
known
all
his
life
had
not
darkened
his
open
door
but
now
isabel
would
come
she
could
not
help
but
come
with
the
passing
of
the
fateful
hour
strength
began
to
return
slowly
she
would
come
and
every
tick
of
the
clock
brought
a
second
nearer
a
steadily
increasing
warmth
came
into
his
veins
and
thawed
the
ice
around
his
heart
the
cold
hand
that
had
held
it
so
long
mercifully
loosened
its
fingers
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
eastern
window
that
he
might
watch
for
the
first
faint
glow
a
single
long
deepening
shadow
struck
across
the
far
horizon
like
the
turning
out
of
a
light
almost
immediately
the
distant
east
brightened
day
was
coming
the
sun
and
isabel
with
the
first
hint
of
colour
hope
dawned
in
his
soul
changing
to
certainty
as
the
light
increased
it
was
not
in
the
way
of
things
that
he
who
had
always
had
everything
should
at
one
fell
stroke
be
left
desolate
out
of
the
wreckage
there
was
one
thing
he
might
keep
isabel
he
laughed
at
the
thought
that
she
would
accept
her
release
what
would
he
have
done
he
asked
himself
were
it
she
instead
of
him
could
mutilation
or
even
death
change
his
love
for
her
he
was
equally
sure
that
hers
could
not
be
changed
it
was
fortunate
that
she
was
saved
that
it
was
he
instead
of
isabel
she
had
pretty
hands
such
dear
hands
as
men
have
loved
and
kissed
since
back
in
the
garden
the
first
woman
gave
hers
to
the
first
man
that
he
might
lead
her
wheresoever
he
would
in
the
midst
of
the
wreckage
he
perceived
a
divine
compensation
for
isabel
would
not
fail
him
she
could
not
fail
him
now
transfigured
by
tenderness
her
coldness
changed
to
the
utmost
yielding
would
bring
him
his
goddess
a
woman
at
last
how
she
will
come
to
me
he
said
to
himself
feeling
in
fancy
her
soft
arms
around
him
and
her
warm
lips
on
his
while
the
flowed
steadily
from
her
to
him
and
made
him
a
man
again
not
a
weakling
his
heart
beat
with
a
joy
that
was
almost
pain
for
he
could
feel
her
intoxicating
nearness
even
now
perhaps
her
sweet
eyes
would
overflow
with
the
greatness
of
her
love
and
her
tears
would
fall
upon
his
face
when
she
knelt
beside
him
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
how
she
will
come
to
me
he
breathed
in
ecstasy
ah
how
she
will
come
and
so
smiling
he
slept
as
the
first
shaft
of
sun
that
brought
his
dear
fell
full
upon
his
face
xvi
how
isabel
came
madame
bernard
and
rose
were
so
deeply
affected
by
allison
misfortune
that
they
scarcely
took
note
of
isabel
few
bruises
greatly
to
that
young
woman
disgust
she
chose
to
consider
herself
in
the
light
of
a
martyr
and
had
calmly
received
the
announcement
that
allison
left
hand
would
probably
have
to
be
amputated
none
of
them
had
seen
him
though
the
two
older
women
were
ready
to
go
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
they
might
be
needed
or
asked
for
isabel
affected
a
sprained
ankle
and
limped
badly
when
anyone
was
looking
once
or
twice
she
had
been
seen
to
walk
almost
as
usual
though
she
did
not
know
it
the
upper
hall
and
occasionally
the
other
parts
of
the
house
smelled
of
the
various
liniments
and
lotions
with
which
she
anointed
herself
she
scorned
the
suggestion
that
she
should
stay
in
bed
for
she
was
quite
comfortable
upon
a
couch
in
her
most
becoming
negligee
with
a
novel
and
a
box
of
chocolates
to
bear
her
company
at
first
she
had
taken
her
meals
in
her
own
room
but
finding
that
it
was
more
pleasant
to
be
downstairs
with
the
others
for
luncheon
and
dinner
managed
to
go
up
and
down
the
long
flight
of
stairs
twice
each
day
placid
as
she
was
the
table
was
not
a
cheerful
place
for
the
faces
of
the
other
two
were
haggard
and
drawn
and
neither
made
more
than
a
pretence
of
eating
daily
bulletins
came
from
the
other
house
as
to
allison
condition
and
madame
was
in
constant
communication
by
telegraph
with
colonel
kent
she
kept
him
reassured
as
much
as
possible
and
did
not
tell
him
of
allison
ineradicable
delusion
that
his
father
was
dead
allison
note
was
given
to
isabel
at
luncheon
the
day
after
it
was
written
having
been
delayed
in
delivery
the
night
before
until
after
she
was
asleep
with
it
was
a
letter
from
her
mother
which
had
come
in
the
noon
mail
she
opened
allison
note
first
read
it
and
put
it
back
into
the
envelope
her
mother
letter
was
almost
equally
brief
that
too
she
returned
to
its
envelope
without
comment
how
is
your
mother
isabel
inquired
madame
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
bold
dashing
superscription
which
was
familiar
though
infrequent
she
all
right
isabel
answered
breaking
open
a
hot
muffin
funny
that
it
should
come
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
why
asked
rose
merely
for
the
sake
of
making
conversation
because
just
as
mamma
writes
to
tell
me
that
marriage
is
slavery
but
that
if
he
can
take
care
of
me
and
aunt
francesca
approves
of
him
it
will
be
all
right
allison
writes
and
releases
me
from
the
engagement
poor
boy
sighed
madame
i
do
know
why
you
should
say
boy
isabel
observed
rather
fretfully
he
not
very
ill
if
he
can
write
letters
i
sure
i
feel
like
writing
any
i
was
thinking
of
that
said
madame
half
to
herself
and
as
for
his
releasing
me
isabel
went
on
coolly
i
glad
he
was
decent
enough
to
do
it
and
save
me
the
trouble
of
releasing
myself
rose
got
to
her
feet
somehow
her
face
deathly
white
do
you
mean
she
cried
that
you
would
think
for
a
minute
of
accepting
release
why
certainly
the
girl
replied
in
astonishment
why
not
he
says
himself
that
he
ca
ask
me
to
marry
a
cripple
rose
winced
visibly
isabel
she
breathed
oh
isabel
my
dear
said
madame
with
such
kindness
as
she
could
muster
have
you
forgotten
that
he
saved
you
from
death
or
worse
he
did
do
anything
for
me
but
to
tell
me
to
jump
i
did
more
for
him
than
that
nobody
seems
to
think
it
was
anything
for
me
to
get
up
out
of
the
dust
with
my
best
white
dress
all
ruined
and
my
face
scratched
and
my
ankle
sprained
and
one
arm
bleeding
and
help
the
crosbys
carry
a
heavy
man
to
their
machine
and
lay
him
on
the
back
seat
i
thought
the
crosbys
carried
him
put
in
madame
they
strong
enough
to
do
it
i
should
think
well
i
helped
i
had
to
take
all
that
nasty
raw
meat
out
of
the
back
seat
and
throw
it
out
in
the
ditch
to
the
dogs
and
stand
up
all
the
way
home
bruised
as
i
was
to
keep
him
from
falling
off
the
seat
we
were
in
a
perfect
bedlam
there
for
a
while
but
it
does
seem
to
make
any
difference
to
anybody
nobody
cares
what
happens
to
me
besides
she
went
on
with
her
voice
raised
to
a
high
pitch
by
excitement
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
expected
to
marry
a
man
with
only
one
hand
he
ca
play
any
more
and
if
he
ca
play
how
can
he
make
any
money
to
take
care
of
me
even
if
i
should
tie
myself
to
him
for
life
do
you
expect
me
to
take
in
washing
and
take
care
of
him
isabel
said
madame
coldly
please
stop
talking
so
loudly
and
please
listen
for
a
moment
nobody
expects
you
to
marry
a
man
whom
for
any
reason
on
earth
you
do
not
love
well
enough
to
marry
kindly
consider
that
as
something
to
be
settled
in
accordance
with
your
own
wishes
and
desires
certainly
interrupted
the
girl
i
like
to
see
anybody
force
me
to
marry
him
madame
compressed
her
lips
into
a
thin
tight
line
and
her
face
became
stern
even
hard
she
clenched
her
small
hands
tightly
and
her
breath
came
quickly
a
red
spot
burned
on
either
cheek
never
having
seen
madame
angry
before
rose
was
almost
frightened
she
herself
was
not
angry
but
hurt
for
him
at
the
moment
she
heard
of
the
accident
her
love
for
him
had
transcended
the
bounds
of
self
and
merged
into
prayer
for
him
and
for
his
good
whatever
that
might
prove
to
be
isabel
said
rose
very
softly
will
you
do
one
thing
for
me
what
isabel
demanded
suspiciously
listen
dear
for
me
if
not
for
him
will
you
go
to
him
and
well
simply
be
kind
do
let
him
think
that
this
terrible
thing
has
separated
him
from
you
or
changed
your
love
wait
until
he
is
strong
and
well
again
before
you
tell
him
will
you
please
isabel
flushed
face
took
on
the
expression
of
outraged
virtue
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
expected
to
lie
she
remarked
evasively
with
a
subtle
change
of
manner
madame
bernard
cleared
her
throat
your
love
was
a
lie
she
said
in
a
tone
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
heard
her
use
before
one
more
matter
isabel
fidgeted
in
her
chair
and
nervously
tapped
the
edge
of
her
plate
with
her
fork
i
have
heard
anybody
say
she
began
with
the
air
of
one
scoring
a
fine
point
that
his
father
does
love
him
and
yet
he
has
gone
near
him
has
even
seen
him
since
we
were
hurt
if
colonel
kent
can
stay
away
from
him
i
do
know
why
i
ca
the
argument
seemed
unanswerable
for
neither
madame
nor
rose
spoke
they
sat
with
averted
eyes
until
the
silence
became
oppressive
and
isabel
with
ostentatious
difficulty
pushed
back
her
chair
and
limped
painfully
out
of
the
room
when
she
had
locked
her
own
door
she
was
more
at
ease
and
began
to
survey
her
unpleasant
situation
nobody
seemed
to
consider
her
at
all
it
was
only
allison
and
everything
and
everybody
apparently
must
be
sacrificed
for
him
just
because
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
when
he
had
both
hands
they
wanted
her
to
go
on
with
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
saw
it
was
impossible
isabel
sighed
heavily
nobody
knew
how
keenly
disappointed
she
was
she
had
written
to
her
few
friends
told
them
about
her
engagement
ring
the
plans
made
for
her
trousseau
the
promised
touring
car
and
the
brilliant
social
career
that
lay
before
her
as
the
wife
of
a
famous
violinist
she
pictured
a
triumphal
tour
from
city
to
city
with
the
leaders
of
fashion
everywhere
vying
with
each
other
in
entertaining
them
or
at
least
her
it
would
of
course
be
necessary
for
allison
to
play
occasionally
in
the
evening
and
they
would
miss
a
great
deal
on
that
account
but
her
days
would
be
free
and
she
could
cancel
all
her
own
social
obligations
by
complimentary
tickets
and
suppers
after
the
concerts
she
had
planned
it
all
as
she
took
lazy
stitches
in
her
dainty
lingerie
aunt
francesca
and
rose
had
been
helping
her
but
the
whole
thing
had
stopped
suddenly
it
seemed
rather
selfish
of
them
not
to
go
on
with
it
for
lingerie
was
always
useful
and
even
though
she
should
not
marry
allison
it
was
not
at
all
improbable
that
she
would
marry
someone
else
if
she
could
find
anybody
who
had
plenty
of
money
and
would
be
good
to
her
she
knew
that
she
would
encounter
no
parental
opposition
in
spite
of
ross
pronounced
views
upon
the
slavery
of
matrimony
allison
had
been
very
decent
in
releasing
her
from
her
awkward
predicament
he
had
even
arranged
it
so
that
no
answer
was
necessary
and
she
need
not
even
see
him
again
she
had
the
natural
shrinking
of
the
healthy
young
animal
from
its
own
stricken
kind
it
would
be
much
nicer
not
to
see
him
again
but
if
he
could
write
letters
now
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
would
be
able
to
come
over
though
his
hand
had
not
yet
been
taken
off
it
was
too
bad
for
everything
had
been
very
pleasant
until
the
accident
she
had
missed
allison
daily
visits
and
had
probably
lost
the
touring
car
though
as
she
had
taken
pains
to
find
out
it
had
fallen
into
the
ditch
and
had
been
injured
very
little
aunt
francesca
and
rose
had
been
queer
ever
since
it
happened
after
colonel
kent
and
the
servants
and
the
twins
had
lifted
allison
out
of
the
yellow
peril
and
carried
him
up
to
his
own
room
on
an
improvised
stretcher
while
someone
else
was
telephoning
for
every
doctor
in
the
neighbourhood
the
twins
had
taken
her
home
she
had
insisted
upon
their
helping
her
up
the
steps
and
as
soon
as
aunt
francesca
and
rose
heard
the
news
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
all
but
with
one
voice
had
demanded
that
the
twins
should
take
them
to
kent
immediately
they
had
gone
without
even
stopping
for
their
hats
and
left
her
wholly
to
the
servants
even
when
they
had
come
home
late
at
night
in
their
own
carriage
it
was
over
half
an
hour
before
aunt
francesca
came
to
her
room
so
overburdened
with
selfish
grief
that
she
did
not
even
listen
to
the
recital
of
isabel
numerous
bruises
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
go
away
though
the
city
was
terrible
in
summer
and
she
had
only
money
enough
to
take
her
to
the
hotel
where
her
mother
retained
a
suite
of
three
rooms
if
aunt
francesca
and
rose
would
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
long
enough
and
she
could
pack
a
and
get
the
carriage
just
in
time
to
take
her
to
the
train
she
could
write
a
formal
note
and
ask
to
have
the
rest
of
her
things
sent
by
express
if
there
were
a
late
train
or
one
very
early
in
the
morning
she
could
probably
manage
it
even
without
the
carriage
but
on
consulting
the
she
found
that
trains
did
not
run
at
hours
suitable
for
escape
however
it
was
just
as
well
to
pack
while
she
had
time
she
could
keep
the
hidden
until
the
auspicious
moment
arrived
it
would
only
take
a
moment
to
open
it
and
sweep
her
toilet
articles
into
it
from
the
top
of
her
dresser
she
had
just
taken
a
fresh
shirtwaist
out
of
the
drawer
when
there
was
a
light
determined
rap
at
the
door
when
she
opened
it
she
was
much
astonished
to
see
aunt
francesca
come
in
dressed
for
a
drive
are
you
almost
ready
isabel
she
asked
politely
ready
gasped
the
girl
for
what
it
seemed
for
the
moment
as
though
she
had
been
anticipated
in
her
departure
and
was
about
to
be
put
out
of
the
house
to
drive
over
to
kent
answered
madame
imperturbably
from
her
manner
one
would
have
thought
the
drive
had
been
long
planned
isabel
sat
down
on
her
bed
i
not
going
she
said
oh
yes
you
are
returned
madame
in
a
small
thin
voice
you
may
go
in
your
tea
gown
and
slippers
if
you
prefer
but
i
will
wait
until
you
dress
if
you
are
quick
about
it
i
wo
isabel
announced
flatly
i
sick
you
know
i
all
bruised
up
and
i
ca
walk
you
can
walk
and
it
only
a
few
steps
farther
to
the
carriage
i
telephoned
over
to
ask
if
he
would
see
you
and
the
nurse
said
that
he
would
be
very
glad
to
see
you
that
he
had
been
asking
all
day
why
you
did
not
come
the
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
door
so
please
hurry
isabel
was
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
the
determined
little
lady
who
stood
there
waiting
but
there
was
something
in
her
manner
that
demanded
immediate
obedience
sullenly
isabel
began
to
dress
if
aunt
francesca
went
with
her
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
say
much
she
caught
at
the
thought
as
though
she
were
drowning
and
the
proverbial
straw
had
floated
into
reach
she
took
her
time
about
dressing
but
madame
said
nothing
she
simply
stood
there
waiting
in
the
open
door
until
the
last
knot
was
tied
the
last
pin
adjusted
and
the
last
stray
lock
brushed
into
place
isabel
limped
ostentatiously
all
the
way
and
had
to
be
assisted
into
the
carriage
during
the
brief
drive
neither
spoke
the
silence
was
unbroken
until
they
reached
the
door
of
allison
room
then
madame
said
in
a
low
tone
the
carriage
will
call
for
you
in
an
hour
remember
he
loves
you
and
be
kind
up
to
that
moment
isabel
had
not
suspected
that
she
would
be
obliged
to
see
him
alone
she
was
furious
with
aunt
francesca
for
thus
betraying
her
but
no
retreat
was
possible
the
nurse
smilingly
ushered
her
in
passed
her
almost
on
the
threshold
and
went
out
quietly
closing
the
door
allison
as
eager
as
a
boy
of
twenty
had
half
risen
in
bed
the
injured
hand
was
hidden
by
the
sheet
but
the
other
was
outstretched
in
welcome
isabel
he
breathed
my
isabel
isabel
did
not
move
how
do
you
do
she
said
primly
i
sorry
i
ca
get
you
a
chair
dear
come
close
wo
you
isabel
limped
painfully
to
the
chair
that
was
farthest
from
him
dragged
it
over
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
just
out
of
his
reach
below
the
rumble
of
wheels
announced
that
madame
had
gone
back
home
unless
she
walked
isabel
was
stranded
at
kent
for
a
full
hour
my
note
allison
was
saying
you
got
it
did
you
yes
it
came
while
i
was
at
luncheon
it
flashed
upon
him
for
an
instant
that
the
reality
was
disappointing
that
this
was
not
all
as
he
had
dreamed
it
would
be
but
pride
bade
him
conceal
his
disappointment
as
best
he
could
you
were
hurt
he
said
tenderly
i
so
sorry
yes
i
was
hurt
quite
a
good
deal
but
you
all
right
now
and
i
so
glad
thank
you
she
answered
listlessly
her
eyes
roved
about
the
room
observing
every
detail
of
furniture
and
ornament
it
was
and
in
a
way
queer
she
thought
she
was
glad
that
she
would
never
have
to
live
there
allison
watched
her
eagerly
like
a
wayfarer
in
the
desert
thirsting
for
water
he
longed
for
her
tenderness
for
one
unsought
kiss
even
in
farewell
his
pride
sustained
him
no
longer
dear
he
pleaded
like
the
veriest
beggar
wo
you
kiss
me
just
once
isabel
hesitated
it
is
proper
she
murmured
now
that
we
are
no
longer
engaged
i
sorry
you
got
hurt
she
added
as
an
afterthought
allison
face
paled
suddenly
so
she
accepted
her
release
then
eager
justification
of
her
made
him
wonder
if
by
any
chance
she
could
have
misunderstood
dearest
he
said
with
cold
lips
did
you
think
for
a
single
instant
that
i
wanted
to
release
you
i
did
it
because
it
was
the
only
thing
an
honourable
man
could
do
and
i
would
let
pity
for
me
hold
you
to
a
promise
made
in
love
it
was
that
i
did
want
you
i
wanted
you
every
day
and
every
hour
only
god
knows
how
i
wanted
you
and
shall
want
you
all
the
rest
of
my
life
unless
he
paused
hoping
for
the
space
of
a
heartbeat
that
the
dream
might
come
true
but
isabel
did
not
move
from
her
chair
she
surveyed
the
opposite
wall
for
a
few
moments
before
she
spoke
it
was
honourable
she
said
in
a
more
friendly
tone
of
course
it
was
the
only
thing
you
could
do
of
course
he
echoed
bitterly
isabel
rose
went
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
leaned
upon
it
facing
him
i
afraid
i
stayed
too
long
she
said
i
think
i
better
go
i
can
wait
downstairs
for
the
carriage
allison
did
not
answer
his
eyes
burned
strangely
in
his
white
face
making
her
vaguely
uncomfortable
and
afraid
she
turned
the
diamond
ring
upon
her
finger
and
slowly
slipped
it
off
i
suppose
i
must
give
this
back
she
said
reluctantly
i
wear
it
now
why
not
he
asked
huskily
because
it
does
mean
anything
now
it
never
did
keep
it
isabel
thank
you
she
said
calmly
putting
it
back
but
on
the
middle
finger
i
must
go
now
i
hope
you
get
along
all
right
wait
just
a
minute
please
he
rang
a
bell
that
was
on
a
table
within
his
reach
and
the
nurse
came
in
please
bring
me
my
violin
isabel
turned
to
the
door
but
was
held
back
by
a
peremptory
command
wait
here
he
cried
shrilly
offering
isabel
the
violin
take
this
too
what
for
she
asked
curiously
i
ca
play
nevertheless
it
belongs
to
you
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
holding
the
violin
awkwardly
isabel
backed
out
of
the
room
the
nurse
following
her
and
closing
the
door
the
nurse
was
a
young
woman
who
had
not
sacrificed
her
normal
human
sympathy
to
her
chosen
work
but
had
managed
happily
to
combine
the
two
she
watched
isabel
disdainfully
as
she
went
very
briskly
for
one
with
a
sprained
ankle
god
said
allison
aloud
oh
god
in
heaven
then
the
nurse
turned
away
in
pity
for
behind
the
closed
door
she
heard
a
grown
man
sobbing
like
a
hurt
child
xvii
penance
the
crosby
twins
had
gone
home
very
quietly
after
doing
all
they
could
to
help
colonel
kent
and
madame
bernard
the
yellow
peril
chugged
along
at
the
lowest
speed
with
all
its
gaudy
banners
torn
down
neither
spoke
until
they
passed
the
spot
where
the
red
touring
car
lay
on
its
side
in
the
ditch
and
four
or
five
dogs
still
hungry
and
hopeful
wrangled
over
a
few
bare
bones
juliet
was
sniffing
audibly
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
wreck
burst
into
tears
oh
romie
she
sobbed
if
he
dead
we
killed
him
romeo
swallowed
a
lump
in
his
throat
winked
hard
and
roughly
advised
juliet
to
shut
up
when
the
machine
was
safely
in
the
barn
and
all
the
scattered
dogs
collected
and
imprisoned
romeo
came
in
ready
to
talk
it
over
got
to
do
something
he
said
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
oh
romie
cried
juliet
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
do
you
think
they
hang
us
we
murderers
romeo
considered
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
we
are
murderers
because
we
did
go
to
do
it
they
wo
hang
us
but
they
ought
to
he
added
remorsefully
what
can
we
do
mourned
juliet
oh
what
can
we
do
well
we
can
pay
all
the
bills
for
one
thing
that
a
good
start
morrow
i
see
about
getting
that
car
out
of
the
ditch
and
taking
care
of
it
somebody
may
steal
it
she
suggested
not
if
we
guard
it
one
or
both
of
us
ought
to
sit
by
it
until
we
can
get
it
into
the
barn
juliet
wiped
her
eyes
that
right
we
guard
it
all
night
and
while
we
guarding
it
we
talk
it
all
over
and
decide
what
to
do
the
dinner
of
unwholesome
delicacies
which
they
had
planned
as
the
last
feature
of
the
day
celebration
was
hesitatingly
renounced
we
deserve
to
have
anything
at
all
to
eat
said
juliet
what
is
it
that
they
feed
prisoners
on
bread
and
water
black
bread
where
could
we
get
black
bread
i
do
know
i
never
saw
any
after
discussing
a
penitential
menu
for
some
time
they
finally
decided
to
live
upon
mush
and
milk
for
the
present
and
if
allison
should
die
forever
we
can
warm
it
in
the
winter
said
romeo
and
it
wo
be
so
bad
when
their
frugal
repast
was
finished
they
instinctively
changed
their
festal
garments
for
the
sober
attire
of
every
day
romeo
brought
in
two
lanterns
and
juliet
pasted
red
tissue
paper
around
them
so
that
they
might
serve
as
warning
signals
of
the
wreck
at
sunset
they
set
forth
each
with
a
blanket
and
a
lantern
to
do
sentry
duty
by
the
capsized
car
ought
we
to
have
a
dog
or
two
queried
romeo
as
they
trudged
down
the
road
watchmen
always
have
dogs
we
ought
to
have
anything
that
would
make
it
any
easier
for
us
to
watch
and
besides
the
dogs
were
to
blame
they
do
need
to
sit
up
with
us
let
have
their
sleep
all
right
romeo
grunted
shall
we
divide
the
night
into
watches
and
one
of
us
sit
on
the
car
while
the
other
walks
no
we
watch
together
and
we
wo
sit
on
the
car
we
sit
on
the
cold
damp
ground
if
we
take
cold
and
die
it
will
only
serve
us
right
we
ca
take
cold
in
june
objected
romeo
with
two
blankets
unless
it
rains
it
wo
rain
tonight
he
said
gloomily
look
at
the
stars
the
sky
was
clear
and
pale
stars
shone
faintly
in
the
afterglow
there
was
not
even
a
light
breeze
the
world
was
as
still
and
calm
as
though
pain
and
death
were
unknown
when
they
reached
the
scene
of
the
accident
romeo
set
the
two
red
lanterns
at
the
point
where
the
back
of
the
car
touched
the
road
they
spread
one
blanket
on
the
grass
at
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
sat
down
to
begin
their
long
vigil
romeo
planned
to
go
home
to
breakfast
at
sunrise
and
bring
juliet
some
of
the
mush
and
milk
left
from
supper
then
while
she
continued
to
watch
the
machine
he
would
go
into
town
and
make
arrangements
for
its
removal
is
there
room
in
our
barn
for
both
cars
she
asked
no
ours
will
have
to
come
out
juliet
shuddered
i
never
want
to
see
it
again
neither
do
i
can
we
sell
it
we
ought
not
to
sell
it
unless
we
gave
him
the
money
we
should
have
it
ourselves
then
suggested
juliet
why
do
we
give
it
away
and
give
him
just
as
much
as
it
cost
including
our
suits
and
the
dogs
collars
and
everything
we
have
no
right
to
give
away
a
yellow
peril
is
cursed
let
sacrifice
it
she
cried
let
make
a
funeral
pyre
in
the
yard
and
burn
it
and
our
suits
and
the
dogs
collars
and
everything
burn
everything
we
got
that
we
care
for
all
right
agreed
romeo
uplifted
by
the
zeal
of
the
true
martyr
and
he
added
regretfully
i
shoot
all
the
dogs
and
bury
in
one
long
trench
i
do
want
to
see
anything
again
that
was
in
it
i
do
either
returned
juliet
she
wondered
whether
she
should
permit
the
wholesale
execution
of
the
herd
since
it
was
a
thing
she
had
secretly
desired
for
a
long
time
you
must
shoot
minerva
and
the
puppies
she
continued
as
her
strict
sense
of
justice
asserted
itself
because
she
was
in
it
she
was
at
home
taking
care
of
her
children
and
they
die
if
she
should
be
shot
now
so
it
was
settled
that
minerva
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
fatal
celebration
should
be
spared
with
her
innocent
babes
and
in
a
few
years
more
said
romeo
hopefully
we
have
lots
more
dogs
though
probably
not
as
many
as
we
got
now
juliet
sighed
heavily
but
was
in
honour
bound
to
make
no
objections
for
long
ago
when
they
arbitrated
the
dog
question
it
was
written
in
the
covenant
that
no
dogs
should
be
imported
or
none
killed
except
by
mutual
consent
and
minerva
had
five
puppies
and
if
each
of
the
five
should
follow
the
maternal
example
and
if
each
of
those
should
do
likewise
juliet
fairly
lost
her
head
in
a
maze
of
mental
arithmetic
we
ought
to
go
into
deep
mourning
romeo
was
saying
i
been
thinking
of
that
we
should
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
only
i
do
know
what
sackcloth
is
i
guess
it
that
rough
brown
stuff
they
make
potato
bags
of
burlap
yes
but
we
have
many
ashes
at
this
time
of
year
and
we
have
still
less
if
we
live
on
mush
and
milk
maybe
we
could
get
ashes
somewhere
she
said
thoughtfully
we
have
to
because
it
would
take
us
over
a
year
to
get
enough
to
repent
in
there
be
ashes
left
from
the
automobile
and
the
suits
and
if
you
can
get
enough
potato
bags
i
fix
so
we
can
wear
at
the
sacrifice
and
afterwards
we
can
buy
deep
mourning
all
right
but
you
must
make
pretty
suits
i
could
out
of
potato
bags
they
have
to
be
plain
very
plain
the
first
thing
is
to
get
this
car
into
our
barn
and
write
and
tell
colonel
kent
where
it
is
then
we
get
our
black
clothes
and
then
we
shoot
the
dogs
and
bury
and
then
we
have
the
sacrifice
and
then
and
then
repeated
juliet
then
we
have
to
go
and
tell
all
what
we
done
and
offer
to
pay
all
the
bills
and
give
the
price
of
the
car
besides
for
damages
oh
romie
cried
juliet
with
a
shudder
we
do
have
to
go
and
tell
do
we
we
do
have
to
take
strangers
into
our
consciences
do
we
certainly
replied
romeo
sternly
just
because
we
do
want
to
do
it
is
why
we
got
to
we
got
to
do
hard
things
when
we
make
a
sacrifice
lots
of
people
think
they
charitable
if
they
give
away
their
old
clothes
and
things
they
do
want
it
is
charity
to
give
away
things
you
want
to
get
rid
of
and
it
is
a
sacrifice
to
do
things
you
do
mind
doing
the
harder
it
is
and
the
more
we
do
want
to
do
it
the
better
sacrifice
his
logic
was
convincing
but
juliet
drooped
visibly
the
bent
little
figure
on
the
blanket
was
pathetic
but
the
twins
were
not
given
to
as
time
went
on
the
conversation
lagged
they
had
both
had
a
hard
day
from
more
than
one
standpoint
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
by
midnight
the
sentries
were
sound
asleep
upon
one
blanket
with
romeo
coat
for
a
pillow
and
the
other
blanket
tucked
around
them
the
red
lanterns
burned
faithfully
until
almost
dawn
then
smoked
and
went
out
leaving
an
unpleasant
odour
that
lasted
until
sunrise
the
rumble
of
a
distant
cart
woke
them
and
they
sat
up
shamefacedly
rubbing
their
eyes
oh
cried
juliet
we
went
to
sleep
we
went
to
sleep
on
duty
how
could
we
dunno
returned
romeo
with
a
frank
yawn
guess
we
were
tired
anyhow
the
machine
is
all
right
when
the
milkman
came
in
sight
they
hailed
him
and
purchased
a
quart
of
milk
he
was
scarcely
surprised
to
see
them
for
the
crosbys
were
widely
known
to
be
eccentric
and
presently
he
drove
on
his
query
about
the
wrecked
car
had
passed
unnoticed
if
you
stay
here
jule
said
romeo
wiping
his
mouth
i
go
and
get
a
team
and
some
rope
and
we
get
the
car
in
ca
i
go
too
no
you
stay
here
it
bad
enough
to
sleep
at
your
post
without
deserting
it
you
slept
too
retorted
juliet
quickly
on
the
defensive
and
i
a
girl
huh
he
sneered
the
claim
of
feminine
privilege
invariably
disgusted
him
beyond
words
suppose
people
come
by
juliet
faltered
and
ask
questions
answer
advised
romeo
briefly
tell
we
killed
a
man
and
are
going
to
suffer
for
it
we
deserve
to
have
everybody
know
it
but
fortunately
for
juliet
quicker
sensibilities
no
one
passed
by
in
the
hour
romeo
was
gone
he
came
from
the
nearest
farm
with
an
adequate
number
of
assistants
and
such
primitive
machinery
as
was
at
hand
the
car
was
not
badly
damaged
and
was
finally
towed
into
the
crosbys
barn
then
they
went
into
the
house
and
composed
a
letter
to
colonel
kent
but
put
off
copying
and
sending
it
until
they
should
be
able
to
get
black
bordered
stationery
two
weeks
later
clad
in
deepest
mourning
the
twins
trudged
into
town
at
colonel
kent
there
was
no
one
in
authority
to
receive
them
and
their
errand
was
of
too
much
importance
to
be
communicated
to
either
physician
or
nurse
their
own
unopened
letter
lay
on
the
library
table
with
many
others
subdued
and
chastened
in
demeanour
they
went
to
madame
bernard
and
waited
in
funereal
silence
until
madame
came
down
how
do
you
she
began
then
stopped
why
what
is
the
matter
we
ran
over
him
explained
romeo
suggestively
inclining
his
head
in
the
general
direction
of
kent
do
you
remember
and
if
he
dies
we
killed
him
put
in
juliet
sadly
we
be
murderers
if
he
dies
romeo
continued
and
we
ought
to
be
hung
in
spite
of
her
own
depression
and
deep
anxiety
madame
saw
how
keenly
the
tragedy
had
affected
the
twins
why
my
dears
she
cried
do
you
think
for
a
minute
that
anybody
in
the
world
blames
you
we
ought
to
be
blamed
romeo
returned
because
we
did
it
but
not
on
purpose
you
could
help
it
we
could
have
helped
it
said
juliet
by
not
celebrating
we
had
no
business
to
buy
an
automobile
or
even
if
we
had
we
should
have
gone
out
in
it
until
we
learned
to
run
it
that
like
staying
away
from
the
water
until
you
have
learned
to
swim
answered
madame
comfortingly
and
allison
is
going
to
die
really
do
you
mean
it
are
you
sure
how
do
you
know
the
words
came
all
at
once
in
a
jumble
of
eager
questions
because
he
is
the
worst
that
could
possibly
happen
to
him
would
be
the
loss
of
his
left
hand
and
his
father
is
looking
all
over
the
country
for
some
surgeon
who
can
save
it
i
rather
die
than
to
have
my
hand
cut
off
said
juliet
in
a
small
thin
voice
so
would
i
added
romeo
we
all
hoping
for
the
best
madame
went
on
and
you
must
hope
too
nobody
has
thought
of
blaming
you
so
you
must
feel
so
badly
about
it
even
allison
himself
would
want
you
to
feel
badly
but
we
do
romeo
answered
in
spite
of
all
the
sacrifices
and
everything
sacrifices
repeated
madame
wonderingly
why
what
do
you
mean
we
did
sentry
duty
all
night
by
his
car
romeo
explained
and
taking
care
of
it
in
our
barn
and
we
lived
on
mush
and
milk
ever
since
juliet
added
i
shot
all
the
dogs
but
the
one
with
the
puppies
said
romeo
she
was
in
it
you
know
juliet
continued
i
helped
dig
the
trench
and
we
buried
the
whole
nineteen
end
to
end
by
the
fence
with
their
new
collars
on
then
we
burned
the
automobile
resumed
romeo
we
soaked
it
in
kerosene
and
put
our
suits
into
the
back
seat
our
caps
and
goggles
and
everything
we
took
out
all
the
pieces
of
iron
and
steel
and
gave
to
the
junk
man
and
then
we
repented
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
how
so
queried
madame
with
a
faint
glimmer
of
amusement
in
her
sad
eyes
juliet
made
suits
out
of
potato
sacks
very
plain
suits
and
we
put
on
to
repent
in
we
went
and
stood
in
the
ashes
put
in
juliet
while
they
were
so
hot
that
they
hurt
our
feet
and
romie
raised
his
right
hand
and
said
repent
and
then
i
did
the
same
and
after
the
ashes
got
cold
we
sat
down
in
and
rubbed
into
the
sackcloth
and
our
hair
and
all
over
our
faces
and
hands
all
the
time
saying
repent
i
repent
continued
juliet
soberly
and
then
we
went
into
mourning
concluded
romeo
madame
heart
throbbed
with
tender
pity
for
the
stricken
twins
but
she
wisely
said
nothing
can
you
think
of
anything
more
we
could
do
or
any
more
sacrifices
we
could
make
inquired
juliet
ready
to
atone
in
full
measure
indeed
i
ca
madame
replied
truthfully
i
think
you
done
everything
that
could
be
expected
of
you
we
wrote
to
the
colonel
said
romeo
but
he
has
got
it
yet
we
saw
it
on
the
library
table
we
want
to
pay
all
the
bills
and
give
allison
as
much
money
as
we
spent
on
the
automobile
and
for
the
suits
and
everything
and
pay
for
fixing
up
his
car
interrupted
juliet
we
want
to
do
everything
romeo
said
with
marked
emphasis
everything
echoed
juliet
that
very
nice
of
you
answered
madame
kindly
and
we
all
appreciate
it
the
stem
young
faces
of
the
twins
relaxed
ever
so
little
it
was
a
great
relief
to
discover
that
they
were
not
objects
of
scorn
and
loathing
for
they
had
brooded
over
the
accident
until
they
had
become
morbid
did
you
say
that
you
had
been
living
upon
mush
and
milk
ever
since
asked
madame
ever
since
they
answered
together
i
sure
that
long
enough
she
said
i
would
do
it
any
longer
wo
you
stay
to
dinner
with
us
with
one
accord
the
twins
rose
impelled
by
a
single
impulse
toward
departure
we
could
said
romeo
we
must
explained
juliet
then
with
belated
courtesy
she
added
thank
you
just
the
same
they
made
their
adieux
awkwardly
and
went
home
greatly
eased
in
mind
as
they
trudged
along
the
dusty
road
they
occasionally
sighed
in
relief
but
said
little
until
they
reached
their
ancestral
abode
dogless
now
save
for
the
pups
gambolling
about
the
doorstep
and
minerva
watching
them
with
maternal
pride
she
said
we
lived
on
mush
and
milk
long
enough
said
romeo
pensively
we
might
fry
the
mush
juliet
suggested
and
have
butter
and
maple
syrup
on
it
maybe
and
drink
the
milk
and
have
bread
too
i
guess
so
and
jam
not
while
we
in
mourning
said
juliet
firmly
we
can
have
syrup
on
our
bread
that
just
as
good
if
you
think
so
you
ought
not
to
have
it
we
got
to
feed
ourselves
or
we
die
he
objected
vigorously
and
if
we
dead
we
wo
be
any
good
to
him
or
to
anybody
else
and
we
ca
ever
repent
any
more
i
not
so
sure
about
that
said
juliet
with
sinister
emphasis
nothing
will
happen
to
us
that
we
do
deserve
romeo
assured
her
so
come
on
and
let
have
jam
if
it
makes
us
sick
it
wrong
and
if
it
does
it
all
right
the
following
day
they
voluntarily
returned
to
their
mush
and
milk
for
they
had
eaten
too
much
jam
and
having
been
very
ill
in
the
night
considered
it
sufficient
evidence
that
their
penance
was
not
yet
over
xviii
less
than
the
dust
the
heat
of
august
shimmered
over
the
land
and
still
to
every
inquiry
at
the
door
or
telephone
the
quiet
young
woman
in
blue
and
white
said
no
change
allison
was
listless
and
apathetic
yet
comparatively
free
from
pain
life
for
him
had
ebbed
back
to
the
point
where
the
tide
must
either
cease
or
turn
he
knew
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
nor
weariness
only
the
great
pause
of
soul
and
body
the
sense
of
the
ultimate
goal
one
by
one
he
meditated
upon
the
things
he
used
to
care
for
isabel
came
first
but
her
youth
and
beauty
had
ceased
to
trouble
or
to
beckon
his
father
had
gone
on
ahead
the
delusion
still
persisted
but
he
spoke
of
it
no
more
even
the
violin
did
not
matter
now
he
remembered
the
endless
hours
he
had
spent
at
work
almost
every
day
of
his
life
for
years
and
to
what
end
in
an
instant
it
had
been
rendered
empty
purposeless
and
vain
like
life
itself
occasionally
a
new
man
came
to
look
at
his
hand
not
from
the
city
now
but
from
towns
farther
inland
the
examinations
were
painful
of
course
but
he
made
no
objections
after
the
man
had
gone
he
could
count
the
slow
distinct
pulsations
that
marked
the
ebbing
of
the
pain
but
never
troubled
himself
to
ask
either
the
doctor
or
the
nurse
what
the
new
man
had
said
about
it
he
no
longer
cared
aunt
francesca
had
not
come
nor
rose
perhaps
they
were
dead
also
he
asked
the
nurse
one
sultry
afternoon
if
they
were
dead
no
she
assured
him
nobody
is
dead
he
wondered
fretfully
why
she
should
take
the
trouble
to
lie
to
him
so
persistently
upon
this
one
point
then
a
cunning
scheme
came
into
his
mind
it
presented
itself
mechanically
to
him
as
a
trap
for
the
nurse
if
they
were
dead
she
could
not
produce
them
instantly
alive
as
a
conjurer
takes
animals
from
an
apparently
empty
box
if
he
demanded
that
she
should
bring
them
to
him
or
even
one
it
would
prove
his
point
and
let
her
see
that
he
knew
how
she
was
trying
to
deceive
him
have
they
gone
away
he
inquired
no
they
still
there
then
said
allison
with
the
air
of
one
scoring
a
fine
point
will
you
ask
miss
bernard
to
come
over
and
see
me
remembering
the
other
woman
who
had
come
in
response
to
his
request
and
the
disastrous
effect
the
visit
had
had
upon
her
patient
she
hesitated
i
afraid
you
not
strong
enough
she
said
kindly
ca
you
wait
a
little
longer
there
he
cried
i
knew
they
were
dead
as
she
happened
to
be
both
wise
and
kind
the
young
woman
hesitated
no
longer
if
i
brought
you
a
note
from
her
you
would
believe
me
you
no
he
replied
stubbornly
is
there
any
way
you
would
know
without
seeing
her
he
considered
for
a
few
moments
i
know
if
i
heard
her
play
he
said
at
length
there
no
one
who
could
play
just
the
way
she
does
suppose
i
ask
her
to
come
over
sometimes
and
play
the
piano
downstairs
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
very
softly
would
you
like
that
yes
that
is
i
do
mind
he
was
sure
now
that
his
trap
was
in
working
order
for
no
one
could
deceive
him
at
the
piano
he
would
recognise
rose
at
the
first
chord
excuse
me
just
a
minute
please
she
returned
presently
with
the
news
that
rose
would
come
as
soon
as
she
could
ca
you
go
to
sleep
now
she
suggested
allison
smiled
ironically
how
transparent
she
was
she
wanted
him
to
go
to
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
she
would
tell
him
that
rose
had
been
there
and
had
played
and
had
just
gone
no
he
answered
i
do
want
to
go
to
sleep
i
want
to
hear
rose
play
so
he
waited
persistently
wide
awake
sharpened
by
illness
and
pain
his
hearing
was
phenomenally
acute
so
much
so
that
even
a
whisper
in
the
next
room
was
distinctly
audible
he
heard
the
distant
rumble
of
wheels
approaching
steadily
and
wondered
why
the
house
did
not
tremble
when
the
carriage
stopped
he
heard
the
lower
door
open
softly
then
close
a
quick
light
step
in
the
living
room
the
piano
stool
whirling
on
its
rusty
axis
then
a
few
slow
deep
chords
prefacing
a
familiar
bit
of
chopin
he
turned
to
the
nurse
who
sat
in
her
low
at
the
window
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
not
telling
me
the
truth
the
young
woman
only
smiled
in
answer
listen
from
downstairs
the
music
came
softly
rose
was
playing
with
the
exquisite
taste
and
feeling
that
characterised
everything
she
did
she
purposely
avoided
the
extremes
of
despair
and
joy
keeping
to
the
safe
living
waters
murmured
through
the
melody
the
sea
surged
and
crooned
flying
clouds
went
through
blue
sunny
spaces
and
birds
sang
ever
with
an
unfailing
uplift
as
of
many
wings
allison
calmness
insensibly
changed
not
in
degree
but
in
quality
as
the
piano
magically
brought
before
him
green
distances
lying
fair
beneath
the
warm
sun
meadows
and
blossoming
boughs
life
he
said
to
himself
life
more
abundant
she
drifted
from
one
thing
to
another
playing
snatches
of
old
songs
woven
together
by
modulations
of
her
own
making
at
last
she
paused
to
think
of
something
else
but
her
fingers
remembered
and
began
almost
of
their
own
accord
illustration
musical
notation
allison
stirred
restlessly
as
he
recalled
how
he
had
heard
it
before
he
saw
the
drifted
petals
of
fallen
roses
the
on
the
dial
hours
wrong
the
spangled
cobwebs
in
the
grass
and
the
other
spangles
changed
to
faint
iridescence
in
the
enchanted
light
as
isabel
came
toward
him
and
into
his
open
arms
could
marble
respond
to
a
passion
could
dead
lips
answer
with
love
for
love
then
isabel
might
have
yielded
to
him
at
least
a
tolerant
tenderness
he
saw
her
now
alien
and
apart
like
some
pale
star
that
shone
upon
a
barren
waste
but
never
for
him
another
phrase
full
of
love
and
longing
floated
up
the
stairway
and
entered
his
room
a
guest
unbidden
illustration
musical
notation
he
turned
to
the
nurse
ask
miss
bernard
to
come
up
for
a
few
minutes
will
you
do
you
think
it
wise
she
temporised
please
ask
her
to
come
up
he
said
imperatively
must
i
call
her
myself
so
rose
came
up
after
receiving
the
customary
caution
not
to
stay
too
long
and
avoid
everything
that
might
be
unpleasant
or
exciting
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
hesitating
her
face
was
almost
as
white
as
her
linen
gown
but
her
eyes
were
shining
with
strange
fires
white
rose
he
said
wearily
i
have
been
through
hell
i
know
she
answered
softly
drawing
up
a
chair
beside
him
aunt
francesca
and
i
have
wished
that
we
might
divide
it
with
you
and
help
you
bear
it
he
stretched
a
trembling
hand
toward
her
and
she
took
it
in
both
her
own
they
were
soft
and
cool
and
soothing
thank
you
for
wanting
to
share
it
he
said
thank
you
for
coming
for
playing
for
everything
either
of
us
would
have
come
whenever
you
wanted
us
night
or
day
suppose
it
was
night
and
i
wanted
you
to
come
and
play
to
me
would
you
have
come
why
yes
of
course
i
would
i
did
know
he
stammered
that
there
was
so
much
kindness
in
the
world
i
have
been
very
lonely
since
her
eyes
filled
and
she
held
his
hand
more
closely
you
wo
be
lonely
any
more
i
come
whenever
you
want
me
night
or
day
to
play
to
read
or
anything
only
speak
and
i
come
how
good
you
are
he
murmured
gratefully
no
please
do
let
go
of
my
hand
in
some
inexplicable
fashion
strength
seemed
to
flow
to
him
from
her
i
think
you
be
glad
to
know
she
said
how
sympathetic
everybody
has
been
strangers
stop
us
on
the
street
to
ask
for
you
and
people
telephone
every
day
down
in
the
library
there
a
pile
of
letters
that
would
take
days
to
read
and
many
of
them
have
foreign
stamps
it
makes
one
feel
warm
around
the
heart
for
it
brings
the
ideal
of
human
brotherhood
so
near
he
sighed
and
his
face
looked
haggard
the
brotherhood
of
man
was
among
the
things
that
did
not
concern
him
now
the
weariness
of
the
ages
was
in
every
line
of
his
body
i
have
been
thinking
he
went
on
after
a
little
what
a
difference
one
little
hour
can
make
a
minute
even
once
i
had
everything
youth
health
strength
a
happy
home
love
a
dear
father
and
every
promise
of
success
in
my
chosen
career
now
i
old
and
broken
health
strength
and
love
have
been
taken
away
in
an
instant
my
father
is
gone
and
my
career
is
only
an
empty
memory
i
have
no
violin
and
if
i
had
what
use
would
it
be
to
me
without
why
rose
i
have
even
fingers
to
make
the
notes
nor
hands
to
hold
it
rose
could
bear
no
more
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
arms
outstretched
all
her
love
and
longing
swelling
into
infinite
appeal
oh
boy
she
cried
take
mine
take
my
hands
for
always
for
a
tense
instant
they
faced
each
other
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
every
quick
breath
her
eyes
met
his
then
faltered
and
the
crimson
of
shame
mantled
her
white
face
oh
she
breathed
painfully
and
turned
away
from
him
when
she
was
half
way
to
the
door
he
called
to
her
rose
dear
rose
she
hesitated
her
hand
upon
the
knob
close
the
door
and
come
back
he
pleaded
please
oh
please
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
obeyed
him
but
her
face
was
pitiful
she
could
not
force
herself
to
look
at
him
forgive
she
murmured
and
forget
the
hand
he
took
in
his
was
cold
but
her
nearness
gave
him
comfort
as
never
before
his
heart
was
unspeakably
tender
toward
her
rose
he
went
on
softly
i
been
too
near
the
other
world
not
to
have
the
truth
now
tell
me
what
you
mean
make
me
understand
she
did
not
answer
nor
even
lift
her
eyes
she
breathed
hard
as
though
she
were
in
pain
rose
he
said
again
tightening
his
clasp
upon
the
hand
she
tried
to
draw
away
did
you
mean
that
you
would
be
my
in
name
she
interrupted
throwing
up
her
head
proudly
just
to
help
you
that
was
all
he
drew
her
hand
to
his
hot
lips
and
kissed
it
twice
oh
how
divinely
kind
you
are
he
whispered
even
to
think
of
stooping
to
such
as
i
have
pity
she
said
brokenly
and
let
me
go
pity
he
repeated
in
all
the
world
there
is
none
like
yours
to
think
of
your
being
willing
to
sacrifice
yourself
through
pity
of
me
the
blood
came
back
into
her
heart
by
leaps
and
bounds
she
had
not
utterly
betrayed
herself
then
since
he
translated
it
thus
listen
he
was
saying
i
cared
terribly
but
it
gone
and
my
heart
is
empty
it
like
an
open
grave
waiting
for
something
that
does
not
come
did
you
ever
care
yes
she
answered
with
eyes
downcast
did
you
care
for
someone
who
did
not
care
for
you
yes
she
replied
again
and
he
never
knew
no
the
word
was
almost
a
whisper
he
must
have
been
a
brute
not
to
have
cared
was
it
long
ago
not
very
have
i
ever
met
him
the
suggestion
of
an
ironical
smile
hovered
for
a
moment
around
her
pale
lips
then
vanished
no
i
have
no
right
to
to
ask
his
name
no
what
difference
does
a
name
make
none
could
you
never
bring
yourself
to
care
for
anyone
else
no
she
breathed
oh
no
and
yet
with
your
heart
as
empty
as
mine
you
still
have
pity
enough
to
to
serve
you
she
answered
her
eyes
met
his
clearly
now
to
help
you
as
your
best
friend
might
rose
dear
rose
you
give
me
new
courage
but
how
can
i
let
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
believe
me
she
said
diffidently
there
is
no
question
of
sacrifice
have
you
never
thought
of
what
you
might
do
that
would
be
even
better
than
the
career
you
had
planned
why
no
what
could
i
do
without
write
she
said
with
her
eyes
shining
let
others
play
what
you
write
immortality
comes
by
way
of
the
printed
page
i
could
he
returned
doubtfully
i
never
composed
anything
except
two
or
three
little
things
that
i
never
dared
to
play
even
for
encores
never
say
you
ca
say
must
and
will
you
saying
them
for
me
you
almost
make
me
believe
in
myself
that
the
very
best
of
beginnings
is
it
she
was
quite
calm
now
outwardly
and
she
drew
her
hand
away
allison
remembered
the
long
happy
hours
they
had
spent
together
before
isabel
came
into
his
life
now
that
she
was
gone
the
old
comradeship
had
returned
the
sweeter
because
of
long
absence
rose
had
never
fretted
nor
annoyed
him
she
seemed
always
to
understand
you
do
know
how
glad
i
be
he
sighed
to
feel
that
i
quite
out
of
it
that
there
was
something
in
life
for
me
still
i
want
to
be
a
bit
of
driftwood
on
the
current
of
things
you
not
going
to
be
i
wo
let
you
have
you
learned
that
sometimes
we
have
to
wait
that
we
ca
always
be
going
on
just
moor
your
soul
at
the
landing
place
and
when
the
hour
comes
you
swing
out
into
the
current
again
much
of
the
driftwood
is
only
craft
that
broke
away
from
the
landing
he
smiled
for
her
fancy
pleased
him
an
abiding
sense
of
companionship
crept
into
his
loneliness
his
isolation
seemed
to
be
shared
and
you
stay
at
the
landing
with
me
he
whispered
until
the
time
comes
to
set
sail
again
yes
and
after
the
worst
that
can
come
is
over
we
make
it
right
with
the
world
and
go
abroad
together
yes
her
voice
was
very
low
now
and
we
be
the
best
of
friends
for
always
yes
the
best
of
friends
in
all
the
world
and
you
promise
me
that
if
you
ever
sorry
you
come
straight
and
tell
me
that
you
ask
me
to
set
you
free
i
promise
then
everything
is
all
right
between
you
and
me
yes
but
i
ashamed
bitterly
ashamed
you
must
be
for
i
very
glad
we
try
to
forget
the
wreckage
together
i
could
have
asked
unless
i
had
known
about
the
other
man
and
you
would
have
told
me
i
know
it
would
have
been
like
you
to
tell
me
there
was
a
knock
the
door
opened
and
the
nurse
came
in
watch
in
hand
i
sorry
miss
bernard
but
you
can
come
if
he
well
enough
i
be
well
enough
said
allison
smiling
of
course
rose
assured
him
shaking
hands
in
friendly
fashion
forget
that
it
a
secret
i
wo
rose
when
she
had
gone
the
nurse
studied
him
furtively
from
across
the
room
he
had
changed
in
some
subtle
way
he
seemed
stronger
than
before
unless
it
was
excitement
to
be
followed
by
a
reaction
miss
bernard
had
done
him
good
the
night
would
prove
it
definitely
one
way
or
the
other
allison
slept
soundly
until
daybreak
for
the
first
time
not
stupor
but
natural
sleep
the
nurse
began
to
wonder
if
it
was
possible
that
a
hand
so
badly
crushed
and
broken
could
be
healed
hitherto
her
service
had
been
mechanically
kind
she
had
taken
no
interest
because
she
saw
no
hope
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
that
long
procession
of
learned
counsellors
should
be
mistaken
after
all
rose
walked
home
disdaining
the
waiting
carriage
she
had
forgotten
her
hat
and
the
sunset
lent
radiance
to
a
face
that
needed
no
more
by
rare
tact
and
kindness
allison
had
removed
the
sting
from
her
shame
and
the
burden
she
had
borne
so
long
was
lifted
from
her
heavy
heart
she
was
happier
now
than
she
had
ever
been
before
in
her
life
but
she
must
hide
her
joy
from
the
others
as
she
had
previously
hidden
her
pain
or
tried
to
she
knew
that
isabel
would
not
see
but
aunt
eyes
were
keen
and
she
could
not
tell
even
her
just
now
how
strange
it
would
be
to
wake
in
the
night
without
that
dull
dead
pain
how
strange
it
was
to
feel
herself
needed
and
oh
the
joy
of
serving
him
she
thrilled
with
the
ecstasy
of
sacrifice
with
that
maternal
compassion
which
is
a
vital
element
in
woman
love
for
man
sublimated
beyond
passion
and
and
asking
only
the
right
to
give
she
poured
out
the
treasure
of
her
soul
at
his
feet
though
her
pride
demanded
that
he
must
never
know
when
she
went
into
the
house
light
seemed
to
enter
the
shaded
room
with
her
no
one
was
there
but
the
open
piano
waited
ready
to
receive
a
confidence
with
a
laugh
that
was
half
a
sob
of
joy
she
sat
down
her
fingers
readily
finding
the
one
thing
that
suited
her
mood
the
wild
music
rang
through
the
house
in
full
deep
chords
but
only
rose
knew
the
words
which
in
her
mind
fitted
themselves
to
the
melody
as
though
she
dared
to
sing
them
less
than
the
dust
beneath
thy
chariot
wheel
less
than
the
rust
that
never
stained
thy
sword
less
than
the
trust
thou
hast
in
me
o
lord
even
less
then
these
less
than
the
weed
that
grows
beside
thy
door
less
than
the
speed
of
hours
spent
far
from
thee
less
than
the
need
thou
hast
in
life
of
me
even
less
am
i
upstairs
isabel
yawned
lazily
and
wondered
why
rose
should
play
so
loud
but
aunt
francesca
smiled
to
herself
for
she
knew
that
allison
was
better
and
that
rose
was
glad
xix
over
the
bar
as
a
flower
may
bloom
in
a
night
joy
returned
to
madame
bernard
house
after
long
absence
there
was
no
outward
sign
for
rose
was
still
quiet
and
but
her
face
was
a
shade
less
pale
and
there
was
a
tremulous
music
in
her
voice
isabel
had
ceased
to
limp
but
still
dwelt
upon
the
shock
and
its
lingering
effects
she
amused
herself
in
her
own
way
reading
covered
novels
feasting
upon
chocolates
teasing
boffin
and
playing
solitaire
madame
remarked
to
rose
that
isabel
seemed
to
have
a
cosmic
sense
of
time
the
guest
never
came
till
luncheon
was
announced
and
did
not
trouble
herself
to
make
an
elaborate
or
even
appropriate
toilet
madame
began
to
wonder
how
long
isabel
intended
to
remain
and
to
see
the
wisdom
of
the
modern
fashion
of
appointing
the
hour
of
departure
in
the
invitation
yet
as
she
said
to
herself
rather
grimly
she
would
have
invited
isabel
to
remain
through
the
summer
and
perhaps
in
the
early
autumn
she
might
return
to
town
of
her
own
accord
moreover
there
appeared
to
be
no
graceful
way
of
requesting
an
invited
guest
to
leave
though
madame
was
annoyed
by
the
mere
fact
of
isabel
presence
she
had
ceased
to
distress
rose
who
dwelt
now
in
a
world
apart
from
the
others
she
spent
her
afternoons
at
the
other
house
playing
softly
downstairs
reading
to
allison
or
talking
to
him
of
the
brilliant
future
that
she
insisted
was
to
be
his
neither
of
them
spoke
of
the
hour
in
which
rose
had
unwittingly
revealed
herself
nor
did
they
seem
to
avoid
the
subject
allison
had
taken
her
for
granted
on
a
high
plane
of
pure
friendliness
and
not
for
an
instant
did
he
translate
her
overpowering
impulse
as
anything
but
womanly
pity
she
practised
for
an
hour
or
two
every
morning
that
she
might
play
better
in
the
afternoon
she
ransacked
the
library
for
interesting
and
cheerful
things
to
read
to
him
and
she
even
found
a
game
or
two
that
he
seemed
to
enjoy
from
madame
francesca
spotless
kitchen
came
many
a
dainty
dish
to
tempt
his
capricious
appetite
and
all
the
flowers
from
both
gardens
daily
made
a
bower
of
his
room
constantly
too
rose
brought
the
message
of
hopefulness
and
good
cheer
from
her
abounding
life
and
superb
vitality
he
drew
unconscious
strength
the
hidden
forces
that
defy
analysis
once
more
exerted
themselves
in
his
behalf
so
far
as
man
is
of
the
earth
earthy
by
the
earth
and
its
fruits
may
he
be
healed
but
the
heavenly
part
of
him
may
be
ministered
unto
only
by
the
angels
of
god
his
old
fear
of
the
darkness
had
gone
and
the
night
light
had
been
taken
out
into
the
hall
in
the
faint
glow
he
could
see
the
objects
in
his
room
distinctly
during
the
brief
intervals
of
wakefulness
a
flower
dropped
from
its
vase
a
book
lying
half
open
a
crumpled
handkerchief
upon
his
chiffonier
the
pervading
scent
of
attar
of
roses
and
dried
petals
all
these
brought
him
a
strange
sense
of
nearness
to
rose
as
a
perfume
may
be
distilled
from
a
memory
day
by
day
isabel
became
more
remote
he
thought
of
her
without
emotion
when
he
thought
of
her
at
all
for
only
women
may
know
the
agony
of
love
enduring
after
the
foundation
upon
which
it
was
built
has
been
swept
away
the
strange
men
from
distant
places
came
less
frequently
days
would
pass
and
bring
no
word
the
country
doctor
who
had
first
been
called
stopped
occasionally
when
time
permitted
and
his
faithful
old
horse
needed
a
little
rest
but
he
only
shook
his
head
he
admitted
to
the
nurse
that
he
was
greatly
surprised
because
the
inevitable
operation
had
not
yet
become
imperative
colonel
kent
seemed
to
have
been
lost
for
almost
a
week
during
that
time
no
word
had
been
received
from
him
and
madame
daily
bulletin
no
change
for
the
worse
had
been
returned
marked
not
found
she
was
vaguely
troubled
and
uneasy
fearing
that
something
might
have
happened
to
him
but
forebore
to
speak
of
her
fears
one
morning
while
allison
was
still
asleep
the
nurse
wakened
him
gently
a
new
man
allison
can
you
see
him
now
i
do
care
he
replied
bring
him
in
the
newcomer
was
a
young
man
one
would
have
guessed
that
the
ink
was
scarcely
dry
on
his
diploma
he
had
a
determined
mouth
a
square
chin
kind
eyes
and
the
buoyant
youthful
courage
that
by
itself
carries
one
far
upon
any
chosen
path
he
smiled
at
allison
and
allison
smiled
back
at
him
in
friendly
fashion
now
said
the
young
man
let
see
his
big
fingers
were
astonishingly
gentle
they
worked
with
marvellous
dexterity
and
for
the
first
time
the
dreaded
examination
was
almost
painless
he
asked
innumerable
questions
both
of
allison
and
the
nurse
and
wanted
to
know
who
had
been
there
previously
the
nurse
had
kept
no
record
but
she
knew
some
of
the
men
and
mentioned
their
names
names
to
conjure
with
in
the
professional
world
even
the
two
great
germans
had
said
it
was
of
no
use
the
young
man
wrinkled
his
brows
in
deep
thought
what
have
you
been
using
he
inquired
of
the
nurse
everything
come
here
she
led
him
into
the
next
room
where
a
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
boxes
almost
covered
a
large
table
he
looked
them
all
over
carefully
scrutinising
the
names
on
the
druggist
labels
sniffing
here
and
there
occasionally
holding
some
one
bottle
to
the
light
and
finally
out
of
sheer
youthful
curiosity
counting
them
then
he
laughed
a
cheery
hearty
laugh
that
woke
echoes
in
the
old
house
and
made
allison
smile
in
the
next
room
it
seems
he
commented
that
a
doctor
has
to
leave
a
prescription
as
other
men
leave
cards
just
as
a
polite
reminder
of
the
call
what
shall
i
do
with
them
dump
all
out
i
do
care
or
wait
a
minute
there
no
rush
he
went
back
to
allison
i
see
you
got
quite
a
drug
store
here
are
you
particularly
attached
to
any
special
concoction
indeed
i
not
most
of
have
hurt
sinfully
i
do
know
that
anything
has
to
be
painful
or
disagreeable
in
order
to
be
healing
remarked
the
young
man
thoughtfully
would
you
like
to
throw
all
out
of
the
window
i
certainly
would
all
right
that
be
good
business
he
swung
allison
bed
around
so
that
his
right
arm
rested
easily
on
the
window
sill
requested
the
nurse
to
wheel
the
drug
store
within
easy
reach
and
rapidly
uncorked
bottle
after
bottle
with
his
own
hands
now
then
get
busy
he
sat
by
smiling
while
allison
poured
the
varying
contents
of
the
drug
store
on
the
ground
below
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
when
the
bottle
swiftly
followed
the
last
gurgling
drop
when
all
had
been
disposed
of
the
nurse
took
out
the
table
and
the
young
man
smiled
expansively
at
allison
feel
better
i
think
so
good
now
look
here
how
much
does
your
hand
mean
to
you
how
much
does
it
mean
repeated
allison
pitifully
it
means
life
career
everything
enough
to
make
a
fight
for
it
then
i
take
it
dull
colour
surged
by
waves
into
allison
white
face
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
a
broken
voice
tell
me
what
you
mean
but
the
young
man
was
removing
his
coat
hot
day
he
was
saying
and
the
young
lady
wo
mind
my
negligee
as
long
as
the
braces
do
show
strange
how
women
hate
nice
new
braces
say
he
said
to
the
nurse
as
she
returned
get
somebody
to
go
up
to
the
station
and
bring
down
my
trunk
will
you
trunk
echoed
allison
sure
smiled
the
young
man
my
instructions
were
to
stay
if
i
saw
any
hope
so
i
brought
along
my
trunk
i
always
looking
for
a
chance
to
hope
and
i
discovered
that
it
one
of
the
very
best
ways
to
find
it
the
nurse
had
hastened
away
upon
her
errand
the
new
element
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
sick
room
had
subtly
affected
her
also
do
fence
allison
was
saying
huskily
i
asked
so
much
that
i
quit
asking
the
young
man
nodded
complete
understanding
i
know
the
sit
around
and
look
wise
and
expect
to
work
miracles
on
a
patient
who
does
know
what
they
doing
and
finally
gets
the
impression
that
he
is
considered
fit
to
know
far
be
it
from
me
to
disparage
the
pioneers
of
our
noble
profession
but
i
modest
enough
to
admit
that
i
need
help
and
the
best
help
every
time
comes
from
the
patient
himself
he
drew
up
his
chair
beside
the
bed
and
sat
down
allison
eager
eyes
did
not
swerve
from
his
face
mind
you
he
went
on
i
do
promise
anything
i
ca
conscientiously
in
getting
a
carriage
out
of
the
mud
more
depends
upon
the
horse
than
on
the
driver
nature
will
have
to
do
the
work
i
ca
all
i
can
do
is
to
guide
her
gently
if
she
pushed
she
gets
balky
maybe
there
something
ahead
of
her
that
i
do
see
and
there
no
use
spurring
her
ahead
when
she
got
to
stop
and
get
her
breath
before
she
can
go
up
hill
that
hand
ca
heal
itself
without
good
blood
to
draw
upon
and
good
material
to
make
bone
and
nerve
of
so
we
begin
to
stoke
up
gradually
and
meanwhile
i
camp
right
here
and
see
what
doing
and
if
you
can
bring
yourself
to
sort
of
well
sing
at
your
work
you
know
it
going
to
make
the
job
a
lot
easier
allison
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
you
give
me
hope
he
said
sure
returned
the
young
man
with
an
infectious
laugh
a
young
surgeon
never
has
much
else
when
he
starts
nor
for
some
time
to
come
want
to
sit
up
why
allison
breathed
in
astonishment
i
ca
who
said
so
everybody
they
all
said
i
must
lie
perfectly
still
of
course
mused
the
young
man
aloud
blood
may
move
around
all
right
of
itself
and
then
again
it
may
not
would
do
any
harm
to
stir
it
up
a
bit
and
remind
the
red
corpuscles
not
to
loaf
on
the
job
the
nurse
came
back
to
say
that
the
trunk
would
be
up
immediately
good
can
i
have
a
bunk
in
the
next
room
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
requested
raw
eggs
and
milk
beaten
up
with
a
little
cream
and
sherry
while
allison
was
drinking
it
he
moved
a
big
easy
chair
up
near
the
window
opened
every
shutter
wide
and
let
the
hot
sun
stream
into
the
room
he
expeditiously
made
a
sling
for
the
injured
hand
slipped
it
painlessly
into
place
put
a
strong
arm
under
allison
shoulders
and
lifted
him
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
now
then
forward
march
just
lean
on
me
muscles
long
unused
trembled
under
the
strain
but
finally
he
made
the
harbour
of
the
easy
chair
gasping
for
breath
good
said
the
young
man
at
this
rate
we
soon
have
clothes
on
us
and
be
outdoors
really
asked
allison
scarcely
daring
to
believe
his
ears
sure
replied
the
marvellous
young
man
confidently
what
the
use
of
keeping
a
whole
body
in
the
house
on
account
of
one
hand
i
going
to
tell
you
just
one
thing
more
then
we
quit
talking
shop
and
proceed
to
politics
or
anything
else
you
like
i
knew
a
man
once
who
was
a
trapeze
performer
in
a
circus
and
he
was
training
his
son
in
the
same
lofty
profession
the
boy
insisted
that
he
could
do
it
and
finally
the
man
said
to
him
here
kid
if
you
put
your
heart
over
the
bar
your
body
will
follow
all
right
and
sure
enough
it
did
now
you
get
your
heart
over
the
bar
and
trust
your
hand
to
follow
get
the
idea
the
sound
of
the
piano
below
chimed
in
with
the
answer
a
rippling
laughing
melody
danced
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
the
young
man
listened
a
moment
then
asked
who
a
friend
of
mine
my
very
dearest
friend
more
good
business
i
think
i
go
down
and
talk
to
her
what
her
name
rose
what
the
rest
of
it
i
ca
start
in
that
way
you
know
bad
form
bernard
rose
bernard
as
quickly
and
silently
as
he
did
everything
else
the
young
man
went
and
the
piano
stopped
but
only
for
a
moment
as
he
requested
her
with
an
airy
wave
of
the
hand
not
to
mind
him
when
she
finished
the
old
song
she
was
playing
he
called
her
by
name
introduced
himself
and
invited
her
out
into
the
garden
because
as
he
said
walls
not
only
have
ears
but
telephones
say
he
began
by
way
of
graceful
preliminary
you
look
to
me
as
though
you
had
sense
thank
you
she
replied
demurely
sense
he
resumed
is
lamentably
scarce
especially
the
variety
misnamed
common
or
even
horse
i
no
mental
healer
nor
anything
of
that
sort
you
know
but
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
if
the
mind
can
control
the
body
after
a
fashion
when
the
body
is
well
it
entitled
to
some
show
when
the
body
is
well
do
you
think
so
rose
assented
though
she
did
not
quite
grasp
what
he
said
his
all
pervading
breeziness
affected
her
much
as
it
had
allison
now
he
continued
i
not
unprofessional
enough
to
knock
anybody
but
i
gather
that
there
been
a
procession
of
undertakers
down
here
making
that
poor
chap
upstairs
think
there
no
chance
i
not
saying
that
there
is
but
there
no
reason
why
we
should
trot
along
until
we
have
to
stop
it
is
necessary
to
amputate
just
yet
and
until
it
is
necessary
there
nothing
to
hinder
us
from
working
like
the
devil
to
save
him
from
it
is
there
surely
not
all
right
are
you
in
on
it
i
replied
rose
slowly
on
anything
and
everything
that
human
power
can
do
day
or
night
until
we
come
to
the
last
ditch
good
for
you
i
appoint
you
first
lieutenant
i
guess
that
nurse
is
all
right
though
she
does
seem
to
be
unduly
optimistic
she
had
nothing
to
make
her
so
everything
has
been
discouraging
so
far
plenty
of
discouragement
in
the
world
he
observed
handed
out
free
of
charge
without
paying
people
to
bring
it
into
the
house
when
peevish
very
true
she
answered
then
her
eyes
filled
oh
she
breathed
with
white
lips
if
you
can
if
you
only
can
we
have
a
try
for
it
he
said
then
continued
kindly
no
salt
water
upstairs
you
know
i
know
she
sighed
wiping
her
eyes
then
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unconfined
rose
obediently
went
back
to
the
piano
the
arrival
of
the
trunk
and
the
composition
of
a
hopeful
telegram
to
colonel
kent
occupied
the
resourceful
visitor
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
then
he
went
back
to
his
patient
who
had
already
begun
to
miss
him
you
forgot
to
tell
me
your
name
allison
suggested
sure
enough
call
me
jack
or
doctor
jack
when
i
not
here
and
have
to
be
called
but
as
you
said
yourself
a
few
minutes
ago
i
ca
begin
that
way
what
the
rest
of
it
if
you
listen
responded
the
young
man
solemnly
i
will
unfold
before
your
eyes
the
one
blot
upon
the
of
my
promising
career
my
full
name
is
jonathan
ebenezer
middlekauffer
what
how
i
mean
excuse
me
stammered
allison
the
young
man
laughed
joyously
you
can
search
me
he
answered
with
a
shrug
the
gods
must
have
been
in
a
sardonic
mood
about
the
time
i
arrived
to
gladden
this
sorrowful
sphere
i
never
used
more
of
it
than
i
could
help
and
everybody
called
me
until
i
went
to
college
the
initials
making
a
shorter
and
more
agreeable
name
but
before
i
been
there
a
week
i
was
or
jemima
to
the
whole
class
so
i
changed
it
myself
though
it
took
a
thrashing
to
make
two
or
three
of
remember
that
my
name
was
jack
how
did
you
happen
to
come
here
queried
allison
without
much
interest
the
man
who
was
down
here
on
the
fifth
sent
me
he
told
me
about
you
and
suggested
that
my
existence
might
be
less
wearing
if
i
had
something
to
do
he
just
passed
along
his
instructions
and
faded
gracefully
out
of
sight
saying
better
go
middlekauffer
as
your
business
seems
to
be
the
impossible
so
i
packed
up
and
took
the
first
train
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
that
your
business
was
impossible
not
impossible
but
the
impossible
good
heavens
man
do
things
get
mixed
like
that
all
he
meant
was
that
such
small
reputation
as
i
have
been
able
to
acquire
was
earned
by
doing
jobs
that
the
other
fellows
shirked
i
ambidextrous
he
added
modestly
and
i
guess
that
helps
some
let
play
piquet
when
rose
came
up
an
hour
or
so
later
they
were
absorbed
in
their
game
and
did
not
see
her
until
she
spoke
she
was
overjoyed
to
see
allison
sitting
up
but
observing
that
she
was
not
especially
needed
invented
a
plausible
errand
and
said
promising
to
come
the
next
day
nice
girl
remarked
doctor
jack
shuffling
the
cards
for
allison
mighty
nice
girl
my
future
wife
answered
allison
proudly
forgetting
his
promise
more
good
business
you
be
a
brute
if
you
did
save
that
hand
for
her
she
entitled
to
the
best
that
you
can
give
her
and
she
shall
have
it
returned
allison
doctor
jack
quick
ears
noted
a
new
determination
in
the
voice
that
only
a
few
hours
before
had
been
weak
and
wavering
and
he
nodded
his
satisfaction
across
the
card
table
that
night
while
allison
slept
soundly
and
the
nurse
also
having
been
told
that
she
was
off
duty
until
called
the
young
man
recklessly
burned
gas
in
the
next
room
with
pencil
and
paper
before
him
first
he
carefully
considered
the
man
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
then
mapped
out
a
line
of
treatment
complete
to
the
last
detail
there
he
said
to
himself
by
that
we
stand
or
fall
the
clocks
struck
three
but
the
young
man
still
sat
there
oblivious
to
his
surroundings
or
to
the
fact
that
even
strong
and
healthy
people
occasionally
need
a
little
sleep
at
last
a
smile
lighted
up
his
face
what
fun
it
would
be
he
thought
for
him
to
give
a
special
concert
and
invite
every
blessed
who
said
it
please
me
or
anything
would
it
to
stand
at
the
door
and
see
come
in
oh
no
there
was
a
stir
in
the
next
room
and
allison
called
him
softly
yes
it
was
only
a
word
but
the
tone
as
always
was
vibrant
with
good
cheer
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
allison
said
that
my
heart
is
over
the
bar
in
the
dark
the
two
men
hands
met
more
good
business
commented
doctor
jack
just
remember
what
somebody
said
of
columbus
day
with
life
and
hope
and
heart
is
time
enough
to
find
a
world
go
to
sleep
now
i
see
you
in
the
morning
all
right
allison
returned
but
he
did
not
sleep
even
after
certain
low
sounds
usually
associated
with
comfortable
slumber
came
from
the
doctor
room
he
lay
there
waiting
happily
while
from
far
mysterious
sources
life
streamed
into
him
as
the
sap
rises
into
the
trees
at
the
call
of
spring
across
the
despairing
darkness
a
signal
had
been
flashed
to
him
and
he
was
answering
it
in
every
fibre
of
body
and
soul
xx
risen
from
the
dead
colonel
kent
in
a
distant
structure
which
by
courtesy
was
called
the
hotel
had
pushed
away
his
breakfast
untasted
save
for
a
small
portion
of
the
nondescript
fluid
the
frowsy
waitress
called
coffee
he
had
been
delayed
missed
his
train
at
the
junction
point
and
fretting
with
impatience
had
been
obliged
to
pass
the
night
there
he
had
wired
to
madame
francesca
the
night
before
but
as
yet
had
received
no
answer
he
had
personally
consulted
every
surgeon
of
prominence
in
the
surrounding
country
and
all
who
would
not
say
flatly
without
further
information
than
he
could
give
them
that
there
was
no
chance
had
been
asked
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
one
by
one
their
reports
came
back
to
him
unanimously
hopeless
heartsick
and
discouraged
he
rallied
from
each
disappointment
only
to
face
defeat
again
he
had
spent
weeks
in
fruitless
journeying
following
up
every
clue
that
presented
itself
waited
days
at
hospitals
for
chiefs
of
staff
and
made
the
dreary
round
of
newspaper
offices
where
knowledge
of
every
conceivable
subject
is
supposedly
upon
file
for
the
asking
one
enterprising
editor
too
modern
to
be
swayed
by
ordinary
human
instincts
had
turned
the
colonel
over
to
the
star
reporter
a
young
man
with
eyes
like
allison
by
questions
and
sympathetic
offers
of
assistance
he
dragged
the
whole
story
of
his
wanderings
from
the
unsuspecting
old
soldier
it
made
a
double
page
in
the
sunday
edition
including
the
illustrations
a
human
interest
story
of
unquestionable
value
introduced
by
a
screaming
headline
in
red
old
soldier
on
the
march
to
save
son
violinist
about
to
lose
hand
when
the
colonel
saw
it
his
eyes
filled
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
words
that
danced
through
the
mist
and
the
paper
trembled
from
his
hands
to
the
floor
he
was
too
nearly
heartbroken
to
be
angry
and
too
deeply
hurt
to
take
heed
of
the
last
stab
no
word
reached
him
until
late
at
night
when
he
arrived
at
the
metropolitan
hotel
that
he
had
made
his
headquarters
when
he
registered
two
telegrams
were
handed
to
him
and
he
tore
them
open
eagerly
the
first
was
from
madame
francesca
slight
change
for
the
better
new
man
gives
hope
better
return
at
once
the
second
one
was
wholly
characteristic
willing
to
take
chance
am
camping
on
job
come
home
it
was
signed
e
middlekauffer
when
he
got
to
his
room
the
colonel
sat
down
to
think
he
knew
no
one
of
that
name
had
never
even
heard
it
before
perhaps
francesca
it
would
have
been
like
her
to
work
with
him
and
say
nothing
until
she
had
something
hopeful
to
say
his
heart
warmed
toward
her
then
he
forgot
her
entirely
in
a
sudden
realisation
of
the
vast
meaning
of
the
two
bits
of
yellow
paper
why
it
was
hope
it
was
a
fighting
chance
presenting
itself
where
hitherto
had
been
only
despair
he
could
scarcely
believe
it
he
took
the
two
telegrams
closer
to
the
light
and
read
the
blessed
words
over
and
over
again
then
trembling
with
weakness
and
something
more
tottered
back
to
his
chair
until
then
he
had
not
known
how
weary
he
was
nor
how
the
long
weeks
of
anxiety
and
fruitless
effort
had
racked
him
to
the
soul
as
one
may
bear
a
burden
bravely
yet
faint
the
moment
it
is
lifted
his
strength
failed
him
in
the
very
hour
that
he
had
no
need
of
it
he
sat
there
for
a
long
time
before
he
was
able
to
shut
off
the
light
and
creep
into
bed
with
his
cheek
pillowed
upon
one
telegram
and
a
wrinkled
hand
closely
clasping
the
other
as
though
holding
fast
to
the
message
meant
the
keeping
of
the
hope
it
brought
utterly
exhausted
he
slept
until
noon
when
he
woke
it
was
with
the
feeling
that
something
vitally
important
had
happened
he
could
not
remember
what
it
was
until
he
heard
the
rustling
of
paper
and
saw
the
two
telegrams
he
read
them
once
more
in
the
clear
light
of
day
fearing
to
find
the
message
but
a
fantasy
of
the
night
to
his
unbounded
relief
it
was
still
there
no
dream
of
water
to
the
man
dying
of
thirst
but
a
living
reality
that
sunlight
did
not
change
thank
god
he
cried
aloud
sobbing
for
very
joy
thank
god
meanwhile
the
resourceful
one
had
shown
the
nurse
how
to
cut
a
sleeve
out
of
one
of
allison
old
coats
and
open
the
seam
having
done
this
she
was
requested
to
treat
a
negligee
shirt
in
the
same
way
then
the
village
barber
was
sent
for
and
instructed
to
do
his
utmost
funny
remarked
doctor
jack
pensively
that
nobody
has
thought
of
doing
that
before
if
i
had
come
just
as
i
did
you
soon
have
looked
like
a
chimpanzee
and
eventually
you
have
been
beyond
the
reach
of
anything
but
a
they
did
even
think
to
braid
your
hair
and
tie
it
with
a
blue
ribbon
the
nurse
laughed
so
did
allison
but
the
pensive
expression
of
the
young
man
face
did
not
change
i
had
occasion
lately
he
continued
to
observe
the
powerful
tonic
effect
of
clothes
a
woman
patient
told
me
once
that
the
moral
support
afforded
by
a
corset
was
inconceivable
to
the
mind
of
a
mere
man
she
said
that
a
corset
is
to
a
woman
what
a
hat
is
to
a
man
it
prepares
for
any
emergency
enables
one
to
meet
life
on
equal
terms
and
even
to
face
a
rebellious
cook
or
janitor
with
repose
which
marks
the
caste
of
vere
de
vere
i
often
wondered
returned
allison
why
i
felt
so
much
well
so
much
more
adequate
with
my
hat
on
clear
case
of
inherited
instincts
the
wild
dog
used
to
make
himself
a
smooth
bed
in
the
rushes
of
long
grass
by
turning
around
several
times
upon
the
selected
spot
consequently
the
modern
dog
has
to
do
the
same
stunt
before
he
can
go
to
sleep
the
hat
is
a
modification
of
the
helmet
which
always
had
to
be
worn
outside
the
house
in
the
days
when
and
murders
were
even
more
frequent
than
now
and
the
desire
for
a
comes
from
the
old
fashion
of
carrying
a
spear
or
a
sword
if
a
man
took
off
his
helmet
it
was
equivalent
to
saying
the
presence
of
my
friend
i
am
safe
when
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
a
lady
now
he
merely
means
not
a
voter
you
notice
that
in
any
gathering
of
men
helmets
are
still
worn
so
he
chattered
with
apparent
unconcern
but
none
the
less
he
was
keenly
watching
his
patient
with
tact
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
diplomat
he
kept
the
conversation
in
agreeable
channels
by
noon
allison
had
his
clothes
on
the
coat
being
pinned
under
the
left
arm
with
two
safety
pins
that
did
not
show
and
was
out
upon
an
upper
veranda
doctor
jack
encouraged
him
to
walk
whenever
he
felt
that
he
could
even
though
it
was
only
to
the
other
end
of
the
veranda
and
back
to
his
chair
somewhat
to
his
astonishment
allison
began
to
feel
better
i
believe
you
a
he
said
two
days
ago
i
was
in
bed
with
neither
strength
ambition
nor
hope
now
i
got
all
three
no
miracle
replied
the
other
modestly
merely
sense
that
afternoon
the
crosby
twins
telephoned
to
know
whether
they
might
call
and
the
nurse
brought
the
query
upstairs
if
they
amusing
said
the
doctor
let
come
allison
replied
that
the
twins
had
been
highly
amusing
until
they
ran
the
yellow
peril
over
his
left
hand
poor
little
devils
he
mused
they
got
something
on
their
minds
mighty
lucky
for
you
that
it
was
a
macadamised
boulevard
instead
of
a
sandy
country
road
observed
the
doctor
the
softness
underneath
has
given
us
a
doubt
to
work
on
how
so
it
easier
to
crush
anything
on
a
hard
surface
than
it
is
on
a
pillow
is
it
of
course
i
had
thought
of
that
if
there
had
been
more
sand
i
look
to
you
to
furnish
that
returned
the
other
with
a
quick
twist
of
meaning
you
got
plenty
of
sand
if
you
have
half
a
chance
to
show
it
how
long
when
do
you
think
you
know
allison
asked
half
afraid
of
the
answer
if
i
knew
i
be
glad
to
tell
you
but
i
do
i
found
out
that
it
easier
to
say
do
know
straight
out
in
plain
english
than
it
is
to
it
used
to
be
bad
form
professionally
to
admit
ignorance
but
it
is
now
people
soon
find
it
out
and
you
might
as
well
tell
at
the
start
you
just
go
on
and
keep
the
fuel
bins
well
supplied
and
the
red
corpuscles
busy
and
pretty
soon
we
see
doing
the
twins
were
late
in
coming
because
they
had
had
a
long
discussion
as
to
the
propriety
of
wearing
their
sable
garments
romeo
disliking
the
trouble
of
changing
argued
that
allison
ought
to
see
that
their
grief
was
sincere
juliet
insisted
that
the
sight
would
prove
depressing
at
the
end
of
a
lively
hour
they
compromised
upon
white
which
was
worn
by
people
in
mourning
and
was
not
depressing
juliet
donned
a
muslin
gown
and
romeo
put
on
his
tennis
flannels
which
happened
to
be
clean
as
they
took
pains
to
walk
upon
the
grass
and
avoid
the
dusty
places
they
were
comparatively
fresh
when
they
arrived
though
very
warm
from
the
long
walk
both
had
inexpressibly
dreaded
seeing
allison
yet
the
reality
lacked
the
anticipated
terror
as
often
happens
they
liked
doctor
jack
immensely
from
the
start
and
were
greatly
relieved
to
see
allison
up
and
outdoors
instead
of
lying
in
a
darkened
room
almost
before
they
knew
it
they
were
describing
their
sacrificial
rites
and
their
repentance
with
a
wealth
of
detail
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
doctor
jack
was
suddenly
afflicted
with
a
very
bad
cough
but
he
kept
his
back
to
them
and
used
his
handkerchief
a
great
deal
even
allison
was
amused
by
their
austere
young
faces
and
the
earnest
devotion
with
which
they
had
performed
their
penance
we
had
your
car
fixed
said
romeo
it
all
right
now
we
paid
the
bill
added
juliet
we
want
to
pay
everything
romeo
continued
everything
she
echoed
i
do
know
that
i
want
the
car
allison
answered
kindly
if
i
had
been
a
good
driver
i
could
have
backed
into
the
turn
before
you
got
there
and
let
you
whiz
by
i
sorry
yours
is
burned
wo
you
take
mine
no
answered
romeo
with
finality
we
do
deserve
even
to
ride
in
one
juliet
remarked
we
ought
to
have
to
walk
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
you
people
make
me
tired
interrupted
doctor
jack
just
because
you
been
mixed
up
in
an
accident
you
about
to
get
yourselves
locoed
as
they
say
out
west
on
the
subject
of
automobiles
by
careful
cultivation
you
could
learn
to
shy
at
a
baby
carriage
and
throw
a
fit
at
the
sight
of
a
wheelbarrow
the
time
to
nip
that
is
right
at
the
start
how
would
you
do
it
queried
allison
his
heart
was
heavy
with
dread
of
all
automobiles
past
present
and
to
come
same
way
they
break
a
colt
get
him
used
to
the
harness
then
to
shafts
and
so
on
now
i
can
run
any
car
that
ever
was
built
make
it
stand
on
its
hind
wheels
if
i
want
to
and
roll
through
a
crowd
without
making
anybody
even
wink
faster
i
think
i
go
out
and
get
that
one
and
take
the
whole
bunch
of
you
out
for
a
cure
juliet
was
listening
attentively
with
her
blue
eyes
wide
open
and
her
scarlet
lips
parted
doctor
jack
was
subtly
conscious
of
a
new
sensation
i
see
she
said
romie
made
me
hold
snakes
by
their
tails
until
i
was
afraid
of
and
made
me
kill
mice
and
even
rats
only
sissy
girls
are
afraid
of
snakes
and
rats
and
just
because
we
were
both
afraid
to
go
by
the
graveyard
at
night
we
made
ourselves
do
it
we
can
walk
through
it
now
even
if
there
is
any
moon
and
never
dodge
a
single
tombstone
was
it
hard
to
learn
to
do
it
asked
the
doctor
if
he
was
amused
he
did
not
show
it
now
no
juliet
answered
because
just
before
we
did
it
we
read
about
it
being
called
acre
so
i
told
romie
that
god
must
be
there
as
much
or
more
than
he
was
anywhere
else
so
how
could
we
be
afraid
after
you
once
get
it
into
your
head
that
god
is
everywhere
added
romeo
you
ca
be
afraid
because
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
the
simple
faith
appealed
to
both
men
strongly
allison
was
much
surprised
for
he
had
not
imagined
that
there
was
a
serious
side
to
the
twins
will
you
forgive
us
asked
juliet
humbly
please
added
romeo
with
all
my
heart
allison
responded
readily
i
never
thought
there
was
anything
to
forgive
then
our
sacrifice
is
over
cried
juliet
joyously
yes
her
brother
agreed
with
a
wistful
expression
on
his
face
and
we
can
have
something
to
eat
the
twins
never
lingered
long
after
the
object
of
a
visit
was
accomplished
so
they
rose
almost
immediately
to
take
their
departure
cards
romie
juliet
suggested
in
an
audible
whisper
romeo
took
a
black
bordered
envelope
from
an
inner
pocket
and
gravely
extended
a
card
to
each
then
they
bowed
themselves
out
resisting
with
difficulty
the
temptation
to
slide
down
the
banister
instead
of
going
downstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
doctor
jack
mobile
face
had
assumed
an
entirely
new
expression
he
put
away
the
card
inscribed
the
crosby
twins
as
though
it
were
an
article
of
great
value
then
leaned
out
over
the
veranda
railing
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
two
flying
figures
in
white
upon
my
word
he
exclaimed
allison
laughed
aloud
you
not
disappointed
in
the
twins
are
you
if
i
were
going
to
be
run
over
remarked
the
doctor
ignoring
the
question
i
believe
i
choose
them
to
do
it
think
of
the
little
pagans
burning
their
car
and
repenting
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
not
to
mention
shooting
the
dogs
and
living
upon
penitential
fare
poor
kids
allison
said
with
a
sigh
tell
me
about
pleaded
doctor
jack
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
especially
juliet
i
do
know
much
replied
the
other
for
i
came
back
here
only
a
few
months
ago
and
when
i
went
abroad
they
were
merely
enfants
terribles
imperfectly
controlled
by
a
pair
of
doting
parents
however
he
gladly
told
what
he
knew
of
the
varied
exploits
of
the
twins
and
his
eager
listener
absorbed
every
word
at
length
when
allison
could
think
of
no
more
and
the
afternoon
shadows
grew
long
they
went
in
consigning
his
patient
to
the
care
of
the
nurse
the
doctor
went
down
into
the
garden
to
walk
back
and
forth
upon
the
long
paths
gaze
mouthed
down
the
road
and
moon
like
the
veriest
schoolboy
over
juliet
blue
eyes
her
pagan
simplicity
her
frank
boyishness
and
her
absolute
unconsciousness
of
self
appealed
to
him
irresistibly
the
dear
kid
he
said
to
himself
fondly
the
blessed
little
kid
wonder
how
old
she
is
then
he
remembered
that
allison
had
told
him
the
twins
were
almost
but
juliet
seemed
absurdly
young
for
her
years
the
world
will
take
her
he
sighed
to
himself
and
change
her
in
a
little
while
so
even
her
own
brother
wo
know
her
she
lace
and
wear
high
heels
and
follow
the
latest
fashion
whether
it
suits
her
or
not
and
touch
up
her
pretty
cheeks
with
rouge
twist
her
hair
into
impossible
coiffures
and
learn
all
the
wicked
ways
of
the
world
the
wavy
masses
of
tawny
hair
the
innocent
blue
eyes
as
wide
and
appealing
as
a
child
the
clear
rosy
skin
and
the
parted
scarlet
lips
all
these
would
soon
be
spoiled
by
the
thousand
deceits
of
fashion
and
i
ca
help
it
he
thought
sadly
then
his
face
brightened
by
george
he
said
aloud
i
only
wonder
if
the
kid
could
learn
to
stand
me
around
the
house
he
laughed
from
sheer
joy
have
a
try
for
her
he
continued
to
himself
me
for
juliet
and
if
the
gods
are
kind
juliet
for
me
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
station
hack
he
instantly
surmised
that
the
man
who
hurried
toward
the
house
was
colonel
kent
and
on
the
veranda
intercepted
him
colonel
kent
yes
doctor
middlekauffer
for
purposes
of
introduction
for
purposes
of
conversation
jack
or
just
plain
never
cared
much
for
handles
to
names
you
got
my
wire
yes
who
sent
you
here
forbes
down
here
on
the
fifth
met
him
out
in
the
next
state
at
an
operation
he
told
me
to
come
as
my
business
was
the
impossible
told
me
you
stand
for
it
do
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
very
glad
how
is
he
doing
very
nicely
all
things
considered
is
there
a
chance
the
colonel
cried
eagerly
a
real
chance
my
dear
man
until
amputation
is
the
only
thing
to
be
done
always
a
chance
personally
i
very
hopeful
though
i
been
called
a
dreamer
more
than
once
but
we
got
him
chirked
up
a
lot
and
getting
his
nerve
back
and
this
morning
i
thought
i
detected
a
slight
improvement
though
i
was
afraid
to
tell
him
so
we
all
got
to
work
for
him
and
work
like
the
devil
at
that
if
work
will
do
it
nothing
worth
while
is
ever
done
without
work
go
up
and
see
him
at
the
sound
of
a
familiar
step
upon
the
stair
allison
turned
deathly
white
he
waited
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
until
the
door
opened
and
his
father
stood
before
him
smiling
in
welcome
allison
sprang
forward
unbelieving
until
his
hand
touched
his
father
not
cold
as
though
he
had
risen
from
the
grave
but
warmly
human
and
alive
lad
dear
lad
i
come
back
at
last
allison
answering
cry
of
joy
fairly
rang
through
the
house
dad
oh
dad
i
thought
you
were
dead
xxi
saved
and
lost
alternately
possessed
by
hope
and
doubt
the
young
surgeon
worked
during
the
weeks
that
followed
as
he
had
never
worked
before
he
kept
his
doubt
to
himself
however
and
passed
on
his
hope
to
the
others
when
he
could
do
so
conscientiously
allison
had
ceased
to
ask
questions
but
eagerly
watched
the
doctor
face
he
knew
without
being
told
just
when
the
outlook
was
dubious
and
when
it
was
encouraging
the
doctor
did
not
permit
either
rose
or
colonel
kent
to
hope
too
much
both
were
with
allison
constantly
and
madame
drove
over
three
or
four
times
a
week
gradually
a
normal
atmosphere
was
established
and
without
apparent
effort
they
kept
allison
occupied
and
amused
it
seemed
only
natural
and
right
that
rose
should
be
there
and
both
allison
and
his
father
had
come
to
depend
upon
her
in
a
way
as
though
she
were
the
head
of
the
household
the
servants
came
to
her
for
orders
people
who
came
to
inquire
for
allison
asked
for
her
and
she
saved
the
colonel
from
many
a
lonely
evening
after
allison
had
said
and
the
doctor
had
gone
out
for
a
long
walk
as
he
said
to
clear
the
cobwebs
from
his
brain
because
of
isabel
whom
he
felt
that
he
could
not
meet
the
colonel
did
not
go
over
to
bernard
allison
had
not
alluded
to
her
in
any
way
but
madame
had
told
the
colonel
at
the
first
opportunity
he
had
said
quietly
a
small
gain
for
so
great
a
loss
and
made
no
further
comment
yet
it
was
evident
that
he
was
relieved
rose
and
allison
were
back
upon
their
old
friendly
footing
to
all
intents
and
purposes
never
by
word
or
look
did
rose
betray
herself
never
by
the
faintest
hint
did
allison
suggest
that
their
relation
to
each
other
had
in
any
way
been
changed
he
was
frankly
glad
to
have
her
with
him
urged
her
to
come
earlier
and
to
stay
later
and
gratefully
accepted
every
kindness
she
offered
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
rose
rather
thought
he
had
but
her
revelation
stood
before
her
always
like
a
vivid
scarlet
hour
in
a
procession
of
grey
days
yet
the
sting
and
shame
of
it
were
curiously
absent
for
nothing
could
exceed
the
gentle
courtesy
and
deference
that
allison
instinctively
accorded
her
he
saw
her
always
as
a
thing
apart
a
goddess
who
through
divine
pity
had
stooped
for
an
instant
to
be
a
woman
and
had
swiftly
returned
to
her
pedestal
sustained
by
the
joy
of
service
rose
asked
no
more
only
to
plan
little
surprises
for
him
to
anticipate
every
unspoken
wish
to
keep
him
cheery
and
hopeful
to
read
or
play
to
him
without
being
asked
these
things
were
as
the
to
her
heart
she
had
blossomed
too
into
a
new
beauty
the
forty
years
had
put
lines
of
silver
into
her
hair
but
had
been
powerless
to
do
more
her
lovely
face
where
the
colour
came
and
went
the
fleeting
dimple
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
and
the
crimson
curve
of
her
lips
were
eloquent
with
the
finer
more
subtle
charm
of
maturity
her
shining
eyes
literally
transfigured
her
in
their
dark
depths
was
a
mysterious
exaltation
as
from
some
secret
holy
rapture
too
great
for
words
allison
saw
and
felt
it
yet
did
not
know
what
it
was
once
at
sunset
when
they
were
talking
idly
of
other
things
he
tried
to
express
it
i
do
know
what
it
is
rose
but
there
something
about
you
lately
that
makes
me
feel
well
as
though
i
were
in
a
church
at
an
easter
service
the
sun
through
the
stained
glass
window
the
blended
fragrance
of
incense
and
lilies
and
the
harp
and
organ
playing
the
intermezzo
from
cavalleria
all
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
why
should
your
best
friend
be
glad
she
had
answered
gently
when
you
have
come
to
your
own
easter
your
rising
from
the
dead
the
dull
colour
surged
into
his
face
then
retreated
in
waves
if
you
can
be
as
glad
as
that
he
returned
clearing
his
throat
i
be
a
brute
ever
to
let
myself
be
discouraged
again
that
night
during
a
wakeful
hour
his
thoughts
went
back
to
isabel
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
affair
in
its
true
light
a
brief
mad
infatuation
he
had
responded
to
isabel
youth
and
beauty
and
an
old
moonlit
garden
full
of
roses
much
as
his
violin
answered
to
his
touch
upon
the
strings
had
answered
he
corrected
himself
trying
not
to
flinch
at
the
thought
even
if
his
hand
should
heal
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
he
would
ever
play
again
and
he
knew
as
well
as
anyone
what
brilliant
promise
the
future
had
held
for
him
he
remembered
how
wisely
he
had
been
trained
from
the
very
beginning
how
aunt
francesca
had
insisted
upon
mathematics
latin
and
chemistry
as
well
as
literature
history
and
modern
languages
he
had
protested
to
her
only
once
she
had
replied
kindly
but
firmly
that
while
broad
culture
and
liberal
education
might
not
in
itself
create
an
artist
yet
it
could
not
possibly
injure
one
since
then
he
had
seen
precocious
children
developed
in
one
line
at
the
expense
of
all
others
fail
ignominiously
in
maturity
because
there
was
no
foundation
the
child
wonder
who
had
thrilled
all
europe
at
nine
by
his
unnatural
mastery
of
the
violin
was
playing
in
an
orchestra
in
a
paris
cafe
where
one
of
the
numerous
boy
sopranos
was
the
head
waiter
how
disappointed
aunt
francesca
must
be
even
though
she
had
too
much
to
show
it
and
his
father
allison
swallowed
a
lump
in
his
throat
after
a
lifetime
of
devotion
the
colonel
had
seen
all
his
efforts
fail
but
he
had
taken
the
blow
standing
like
the
soldier
that
he
was
in
vain
many
a
time
allison
had
wished
that
some
of
his
father
fine
courage
might
have
been
transmitted
to
him
and
rose
dear
rose
how
persistently
she
held
the
new
way
open
before
him
how
steadily
she
insisted
that
the
creative
impulse
was
higher
than
interpretative
skill
how
often
she
had
reminded
him
of
stirring
call
produce
produce
though
it
be
but
the
merest
fraction
of
a
fragment
produce
it
in
god
name
he
had
noticed
that
the
materials
for
composition
were
always
close
at
hand
though
she
never
urged
him
to
work
he
had
come
gradually
to
depend
upon
rose
a
great
deal
more
than
he
realised
quite
often
he
perceived
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
a
ribbon
friendship
is
better
than
an
honourable
mention
love
it
was
evident
that
isabel
had
never
loved
him
though
she
had
been
pleased
and
flattered
by
his
love
for
her
even
at
the
time
that
aunt
francesca
and
rose
had
congratulated
him
and
he
had
kissed
them
both
in
friendly
fashion
he
had
taken
passing
note
of
the
difference
between
isabel
and
rose
of
course
it
was
only
that
isabel
was
made
of
ice
and
rose
of
flesh
and
blood
but
still
it
was
pleasant
to
remember
that
his
thoughts
began
to
stray
into
other
fields
rose
was
his
promised
wife
as
far
as
name
went
yet
she
treated
him
with
the
frank
good
comradeship
that
a
liberal
social
code
makes
possible
between
men
and
women
as
far
as
rose
was
concerned
there
was
no
sentiment
in
the
world
when
she
read
to
him
it
was
invariably
a
story
of
adventure
or
of
humorous
complications
or
a
exposition
of
some
recent
advance
in
science
or
art
their
conversation
was
equally
impersonal
even
at
the
rare
times
they
chanced
to
be
alone
rose
made
colonel
kent
aunt
francesca
doctor
jack
and
even
the
nurse
equally
welcome
to
allison
society
he
went
freely
from
room
to
room
on
the
upper
floor
but
had
not
yet
been
downstairs
as
a
possible
slip
on
the
steps
might
do
irreparable
injury
doctor
jack
wanted
to
get
him
downstairs
and
outdoors
believing
that
actual
contact
with
the
earth
is
almost
as
good
for
people
as
it
is
for
plants
but
saw
no
way
to
manage
it
without
a
stretcher
which
he
knew
allison
would
violently
resent
the
twins
came
occasionally
by
special
invitation
though
nobody
noticed
that
it
was
always
doctor
jack
who
suggested
it
once
they
brought
a
pan
of
juliet
famous
fudges
which
were
politely
appreciated
by
the
others
and
extravagantly
praised
by
the
doctor
the
following
day
he
was
rewarded
by
a
private
pan
of
especially
rich
fudges
but
romeo
brought
it
on
his
way
to
the
there
was
a
daily
upon
the
upper
veranda
and
sometimes
meals
were
served
there
the
piano
had
been
moved
upstairs
into
a
back
room
the
devotion
of
the
household
was
beautiful
to
behold
yet
underneath
it
all
like
an
unseen
current
was
the
tense
strain
of
waiting
it
was
difficult
not
to
annoy
doctor
jack
with
questions
rose
and
the
colonel
continually
reminded
themselves
and
each
other
that
he
would
be
only
too
glad
to
bring
encouragement
at
the
moment
he
found
it
and
that
by
quiet
and
patience
they
could
help
him
most
juliet
had
pleaded
earnestly
with
doctor
jack
to
save
allison
hand
if
you
do
she
said
with
uplifted
eyes
i
be
miserable
all
the
rest
of
my
life
bless
your
little
heart
the
doctor
had
answered
kindly
i
do
anything
to
keep
you
from
being
miserable
even
the
impossible
which
happens
to
be
my
specialty
she
did
not
quite
understand
but
sent
a
burnt
offering
to
the
doctor
in
the
shape
of
a
chocolate
cake
he
had
returned
the
compliment
by
sending
her
the
biggest
box
of
candy
she
had
ever
seen
and
as
it
arrived
about
noon
she
and
romeo
had
feasted
upon
it
until
they
could
eat
no
more
and
had
been
uncomfortably
ill
for
two
days
romeo
had
attributed
their
misfortune
to
the
candy
itself
but
juliet
believed
that
their
constitutions
had
been
weakened
by
their
penitential
fare
and
as
soon
as
she
was
able
proved
her
point
by
finishing
the
last
sweet
morsel
without
painful
results
the
summer
waned
and
tints
of
palest
gold
appeared
here
and
there
upon
the
maples
the
warm
wind
had
the
indefinable
freshness
of
the
autumn
sea
blown
far
inland
at
dawn
allison
became
impatient
and
restless
the
colonel
went
off
alone
for
long
moody
walks
even
doctor
jack
began
to
show
the
effects
of
the
long
strain
only
rose
was
serene
fortunately
no
one
guessed
the
tumult
that
lay
beneath
her
outward
calm
her
manner
toward
allison
was
if
anything
more
impersonal
than
ever
though
she
failed
in
no
thoughtful
kindness
no
possible
consideration
he
accepted
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
but
began
to
wish
vaguely
for
something
more
he
forebore
to
remind
her
of
their
strange
relation
and
could
not
allude
to
the
night
he
had
kissed
her
while
his
fiancee
stood
near
by
yet
late
one
afternoon
when
she
had
excused
herself
a
little
earlier
than
usual
he
called
her
back
rose
yes
she
returned
quickly
and
stood
before
him
just
out
of
his
reach
what
is
it
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
tone
was
kind
but
impersonal
as
always
nothing
he
sighed
turning
his
face
away
that
night
she
pondered
long
what
could
allison
want
that
she
had
not
given
the
blood
surged
into
her
heart
for
an
instant
then
retreated
nonsense
she
said
to
herself
in
tremulous
anger
it
impossible
afterward
it
seemed
continually
to
happen
that
she
was
alone
with
allison
when
the
time
came
to
say
and
drive
home
or
walk
escorted
by
colonel
kent
or
the
doctor
by
common
consent
they
seemed
to
make
excuses
to
leave
the
room
as
the
hour
of
departure
approached
and
she
always
found
it
easier
when
someone
was
there
again
when
she
had
made
her
adieux
and
had
reached
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
allison
called
her
back
yes
could
you
just
once
you
know
for
he
asked
with
difficulty
his
face
made
his
meaning
clear
rose
bent
kissed
him
tenderly
upon
the
forehead
and
quickly
left
the
room
her
heart
was
beating
so
hard
that
she
did
not
know
she
stumbled
upon
the
threshold
nor
did
she
hear
his
low
thank
you
dear
that
night
she
could
not
sleep
i
ca
she
said
to
herself
miserably
i
ca
possibly
go
on
if
oh
why
should
he
make
it
so
hard
for
me
if
the
future
was
to
be
possible
on
the
lines
already
laid
down
he
too
must
keep
the
impersonal
attitude
yet
none
the
less
she
was
conscious
of
an
uplifting
joy
that
would
not
be
put
aside
but
insistently
demanded
its
right
of
expression
she
did
not
dare
trust
herself
to
see
allison
again
and
yet
she
must
she
could
not
fail
him
now
when
he
needed
her
so
much
nor
could
she
ask
the
others
to
see
that
they
were
not
left
alone
one
day
might
be
gained
for
respite
by
the
plea
of
a
headache
which
is
woman
friend
as
often
as
it
is
her
enemy
and
after
that
one
day
what
then
what
other
excuse
could
she
make
that
would
not
seem
heartless
and
cold
it
was
an
old
saying
of
aunt
francesca
that
when
you
ca
see
straight
ahead
it
because
you
about
to
turn
a
corner
she
tormented
herself
throughout
the
night
with
futile
speculations
that
led
to
nothing
except
the
headache
which
she
had
planned
to
offer
as
an
excuse
a
brief
note
gave
her
the
day
to
herself
and
also
brought
flowers
from
allison
with
a
friendly
note
in
his
own
hand
doctor
jack
was
the
messenger
and
took
occasion
to
offer
his
services
in
the
conquest
of
the
headache
but
rose
declined
with
thanks
sending
down
word
that
she
preferred
to
sleep
it
off
though
breakfast
might
be
a
movable
feast
at
madame
it
was
always
consistently
late
it
was
nearly
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
telephone
wakened
madame
from
a
dreamless
sleep
she
listened
until
it
became
annoying
but
no
one
answered
it
finally
she
got
up
rather
impatiently
and
went
to
it
herself
anticipating
rose
by
only
a
minute
tremulous
with
suspense
rose
waited
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
until
madame
turned
with
a
cry
of
joy
the
receiver
falling
from
her
nerveless
hand
rose
rose
he
saved
our
boy
is
saved
he
saved
do
you
understand
truly
is
it
sure
blessedly
sure
oh
rose
he
saved
the
little
old
lady
was
sobbing
in
an
ecstasy
of
relief
rose
led
her
to
a
couch
and
waited
quietly
until
she
was
almost
calm
then
went
back
to
her
own
room
once
more
her
world
was
changed
as
long
ago
she
had
seen
how
it
must
be
with
her
should
the
one
thing
happen
she
with
the
others
had
hoped
and
prayed
for
it
her
dearest
dream
had
come
true
at
last
and
left
her
desolate
she
was
unselfishly
glad
for
allison
for
the
colonel
aunt
francesca
doctor
jack
the
sorrowing
twins
and
in
a
way
for
herself
it
had
been
given
her
to
serve
him
and
she
had
not
hoped
for
more
it
made
things
easier
now
though
she
had
not
thought
the
corner
would
be
turned
in
just
this
way
having
made
up
her
mind
and
completed
her
plans
she
went
to
madame
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
she
had
hidden
her
paleness
with
so
little
rouge
that
even
madame
keen
eyes
could
not
suspect
it
aunt
francesca
she
began
without
preliminary
i
got
to
go
away
why
dear
and
where
for
how
long
because
i
so
tired
things
have
been
hard
for
me
over
there
lately
and
i
do
care
where
i
go
i
see
returned
madame
tenderly
you
want
to
go
away
for
a
rest
you
needed
it
for
a
long
time
yes
rose
nodded
swinging
easily
into
the
lie
that
did
not
deceive
either
oh
aunt
francesca
can
i
go
surely
at
any
hour
you
choose
and
you
make
it
right
indeed
i
will
i
just
say
that
you
been
obliged
to
go
away
on
business
to
look
after
some
investments
for
both
of
us
and
i
hope
you
stay
away
long
enough
to
get
the
rest
and
change
you
needed
for
almost
a
year
oh
aunt
francesca
how
good
you
are
but
where
where
shall
i
go
madame
had
been
thinking
of
that
she
knew
the
one
place
where
rose
could
go
and
attain
her
balance
in
solitude
untroubled
by
needless
questions
or
explanations
with
the
feeling
of
the
mother
who
gives
her
dead
baby
dainty
garments
to
a
living
child
sorely
in
need
she
spoke
to
my
house
up
in
the
woods
the
little
house
where
love
lived
so
long
ago
rose
pale
lips
quivered
for
an
instant
what
have
i
to
do
with
love
go
to
the
house
where
he
lived
once
and
perhaps
you
may
find
out
i
will
i
be
glad
to
go
if
i
could
make
the
next
train
could
you
arrange
to
have
a
trunk
follow
me
of
course
go
on
dear
i
know
how
it
happens
sometimes
that
one
stay
in
one
place
any
longer
i
suffered
from
wanderlust
until
i
was
almost
seventy
and
it
a
long
time
since
you
been
away
and
you
promise
not
to
tell
anybody
i
promise
while
rose
was
packing
a
madame
brought
her
a
rusty
fashioned
key
and
a
card
on
which
she
had
written
directions
for
the
journey
i
ordered
the
carriage
she
said
and
i
drive
down
with
you
to
see
you
safely
off
after
the
packing
was
completed
and
while
there
was
still
nearly
an
hour
to
wait
before
the
carriage
would
come
rose
locked
her
door
and
after
many
failures
achieved
her
note
my
dear
allison
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
for
you
and
how
glad
i
shall
be
all
the
rest
of
my
life
i
hoped
and
dreamed
and
prayed
from
the
very
beginning
that
it
might
be
so
and
i
believe
that
in
time
you
have
back
everything
you
have
lost
now
that
you
no
longer
need
me
i
am
going
away
to
attend
to
some
necessary
business
for
aunt
francesca
and
myself
and
perhaps
to
rest
a
little
while
in
some
new
place
before
i
go
back
to
my
work
of
course
our
engagement
expires
automatically
now
and
i
hope
you
soon
find
the
one
woman
meant
to
make
you
happy
i
am
glad
to
think
that
i
helped
you
a
little
when
you
came
to
a
hard
place
for
the
most
that
any
one
of
us
may
do
for
another
is
to
smooth
the
road
remember
me
to
the
others
say
for
me
and
believe
me
with
all
good
wishes
your
friend
always
rose
when
she
sealed
and
addressed
it
she
had
a
queer
sense
of
closing
the
door
with
her
own
hands
upon
all
the
joy
life
might
have
in
store
for
her
in
years
to
come
yet
the
past
few
weeks
were
secure
beyond
the
power
of
change
or
loss
and
her
pride
was
saved
no
one
could
keep
her
from
loving
him
and
the
thought
brought
a
certain
comfort
to
her
sore
heart
wherever
he
might
be
and
whatever
might
happen
to
him
she
could
still
love
him
from
afar
and
have
for
her
very
own
the
woman
joy
of
utmost
giving
when
the
carriage
came
she
went
down
and
without
a
word
put
her
note
into
aunt
francesca
faithful
hands
isabel
had
not
appeared
fortunately
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
leave
any
message
aunt
francesca
would
make
it
right
as
she
always
had
with
everybody
when
the
little
old
lady
lifted
her
face
saying
dear
come
back
to
me
soon
rose
heart
misgave
her
i
stay
she
said
brokenly
i
wo
leave
you
but
madame
only
smiled
and
nodded
toward
the
waiting
train
she
stood
on
the
platform
waving
her
little
handkerchief
until
the
last
car
rounded
the
curve
and
the
fluttering
bit
of
white
that
was
waved
in
answer
had
vanished
then
madame
sighed
wiped
her
eyes
and
drove
home
xxii
a
birthday
party
allison
received
the
note
from
rose
at
the
time
he
was
expecting
rose
herself
and
was
keenly
disappointed
she
might
at
least
have
stopped
long
enough
to
say
he
said
to
his
father
do
be
selfish
lad
laughed
the
colonel
we
owe
her
now
a
debt
that
we
can
never
hope
to
pay
the
young
man
face
softened
what
a
brick
she
has
been
then
to
himself
he
added
if
she
had
loved
me
she
could
have
done
more
life
seemed
very
good
to
them
both
that
crisp
september
morning
just
after
breakfast
doctor
jack
had
announced
definitely
that
the
crushed
hand
was
saved
unless
there
should
be
some
complication
but
mind
you
he
insisted
i
do
promise
any
and
there
be
scars
but
we
make
it
look
as
well
as
we
can
anyhow
you
not
be
helpless
allison
smiled
happily
why
ca
i
play
if
it
heals
up
all
right
there
may
be
a
nerve
or
two
that
wo
work
just
right
or
a
twisted
muscle
or
something
however
we
keep
hoping
the
heavy
weight
that
had
lain
so
long
upon
allison
heart
was
slow
in
lifting
at
first
he
could
not
believe
the
good
news
greatly
to
doctor
jack
disgust
you
do
seem
to
care
much
he
remarked
i
supposed
you
turn
at
least
one
somersault
the
colonel
is
more
pleased
than
you
are
dear
old
dad
said
allison
gratefully
i
owe
him
everything
everything
repeated
the
doctor
with
lifted
brows
and
where
does
jonathan
ebenezer
middlekauffer
come
in
to
say
nothing
of
the
future
mrs
kent
allison
face
clouded
for
an
instant
i
never
forget
what
done
for
me
but
there
is
any
future
mrs
kent
no
why
i
thought
so
did
i
but
she
thrown
me
over
and
gone
away
this
morning
she
sent
me
a
note
of
congratulation
and
farewell
upon
my
word
what
have
you
done
to
her
nothing
she
says
i
do
need
her
any
more
now
so
she
going
away
doctor
jack
paced
back
and
forth
on
the
veranda
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
darkly
mysterious
ways
of
the
are
wonderful
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
portray
apparently
you
had
to
choose
between
your
hand
and
hers
i
not
sure
returned
allison
thoughtfully
that
i
would
rather
have
hers
than
mine
brace
up
old
man
get
well
and
go
after
her
the
world
is
big
enough
to
keep
a
man
away
from
the
woman
he
wants
but
answered
allison
dejectedly
she
does
care
for
me
it
was
only
womanly
pity
and
now
that
i
do
need
that
i
lost
her
she
does
care
for
you
repeated
the
doctor
why
man
how
can
you
sit
there
and
tell
a
lie
like
that
of
course
she
cares
allison
turned
to
look
at
him
in
astonishment
it
is
possible
is
it
then
i
do
know
anything
about
human
nature
though
i
must
confess
i
not
up
much
on
the
feminine
part
of
it
how
long
just
since
the
accident
the
girl
i
was
going
to
marry
let
me
release
her
she
did
want
a
cripple
you
know
and
miss
bernard
did
and
you
disappointed
her
something
like
that
you
seem
to
have
had
fierce
luck
with
girls
one
gives
you
up
because
you
only
got
one
hand
and
the
other
because
you
got
two
no
pleasing
women
hello
here
comes
another
note
maybe
she
changed
her
mind
for
a
breathless
instant
allison
thought
so
too
but
doctor
jack
was
opening
it
mine
he
said
it
an
invitation
to
crosby
it
seems
that
they
come
of
age
day
after
and
i
invited
out
to
supper
to
help
celebrate
i
wo
go
or
anything
will
i
oh
no
of
course
not
i
have
seen
for
a
week
are
presents
expected
your
presence
seems
to
be
expected
remarked
allison
i
glad
you
got
that
out
of
your
system
the
doctor
retorted
with
a
scornful
smile
you
ought
to
improve
right
along
now
is
it
a
party
they
do
say
so
i
hope
it
is
however
when
doctor
jack
strolled
up
the
dusty
road
a
carriage
that
must
have
come
from
crosby
passed
him
he
stopped
short
wildly
considering
an
impulse
of
flight
then
he
went
on
bravely
smiling
at
the
thought
that
any
entertainment
given
by
the
twins
could
be
by
any
possibility
a
formal
affair
the
other
guest
was
isabel
whom
doctor
jack
had
not
met
and
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
she
observed
him
narrowly
when
opportunity
offered
for
she
knew
who
he
was
and
wondered
what
he
had
heard
of
her
soon
she
became
certain
that
her
name
carried
no
meaning
to
him
for
he
talked
freely
of
allison
and
the
colonel
and
frankly
shared
the
joy
of
the
twins
at
the
welcome
news
oh
cried
juliet
clapping
her
hands
in
glee
it
the
very
best
birthday
present
we
could
have
is
it
romie
i
should
say
replied
that
young
man
with
an
expansive
smile
say
he
added
to
doctor
jack
you
must
be
a
brick
i
only
done
my
best
he
responded
modestly
isabel
could
say
nothing
for
some
little
time
she
was
furiously
angry
with
aunt
francesca
because
she
had
not
told
her
the
day
that
rose
went
away
everyone
in
the
house
had
been
very
glad
about
something
even
to
the
servants
but
she
had
asked
no
questions
and
received
no
information
except
that
rose
had
been
obliged
to
go
away
very
suddenly
upon
business
of
immediate
importance
you
must
be
awful
glad
said
juliet
to
isabel
of
course
answered
isabel
coldly
clearing
her
throat
he
must
feel
pretty
good
romeo
observed
yes
returned
doctor
jack
except
that
he
lost
his
girl
isabel
flushed
and
nervously
turned
on
her
finger
the
diamond
ring
that
she
still
wore
he
had
fierce
luck
with
girls
resumed
the
doctor
unthinkingly
one
passed
him
up
because
he
was
hurt
and
the
other
because
he
was
going
to
get
well
the
tense
silence
that
ensued
indicated
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
of
some
sort
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
twins
did
not
know
of
allison
engagement
to
rose
nor
did
he
suspect
isabel
identity
juliet
was
staring
at
isabel
in
pained
surprise
did
you
she
asked
slowly
throw
him
over
because
he
got
hurt
he
offered
to
release
me
said
isabel
in
a
small
cold
voice
and
i
accepted
i
did
not
know
until
just
now
that
cousin
rose
had
taken
my
leavings
the
older
woman
mysterious
departure
presented
itself
to
her
now
in
a
new
light
suffering
cyrus
said
doctor
jack
aloud
but
i
have
put
my
foot
into
it
look
here
kind
friends
i
never
was
meant
for
a
parlour
and
i
always
make
mistakes
when
i
stray
into
one
my
place
is
in
a
hospital
ward
or
at
the
bedside
of
those
who
have
been
given
up
to
die
the
complex
social
arena
is
not
where
i
shine
to
my
best
advantage
there
are
too
many
rings
to
keep
track
of
at
once
and
my
mind
gets
eyed
come
on
up
to
the
attic
suggested
juliet
with
a
swift
change
of
subject
and
we
do
stunts
on
the
trapeze
isabel
and
doctor
jack
sat
side
by
side
on
a
battered
old
trunk
in
stony
silence
while
the
twins
were
donning
their
gymnasium
costumes
fortunately
it
did
not
take
long
and
the
sight
of
juliet
hanging
by
her
feet
furnished
the
needed
topic
of
conversation
the
lithe
little
body
seemed
to
be
made
of
steel
fibres
she
swayed
back
and
forth
catching
romeo
as
he
made
a
flying
leap
from
the
other
trapeze
as
easily
as
another
girl
would
have
wielded
a
tennis
racquet
at
length
doctor
jack
interposed
a
friendly
word
of
warning
look
here
kid
he
said
you
made
of
flesh
and
blood
you
know
just
like
the
rest
of
us
better
cut
out
that
trapeze
business
i
do
know
why
returned
juliet
resentfully
as
she
slipped
gracefully
to
the
floor
right
side
up
i
as
strong
as
romie
is
or
almost
as
strong
girls
do
it
in
the
circus
romeo
observed
wiping
his
flushed
face
ever
heard
of
any
of
living
to
celebrate
their
hundredth
birthday
queried
doctor
jack
significantly
the
twins
admitted
that
they
had
not
i
do
care
cried
juliet
rather
live
ten
years
and
keep
going
than
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
have
to
sit
still
all
the
time
no
danger
of
your
sitting
still
too
long
returned
doctor
jack
humouredly
it
hot
up
here
is
it
rather
warm
romeo
agreed
you
folks
can
go
downstairs
until
we
get
on
our
other
clothes
if
you
like
they
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
isabel
changed
her
mind
i
believe
i
wait
for
juliet
she
said
turning
back
so
the
doctor
went
down
alone
inwardly
reviling
himself
for
his
unlucky
speech
and
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
contemplate
the
characteristic
residence
of
the
twins
the
whole
house
was
frankly
a
place
where
people
did
as
they
chose
and
the
furniture
bore
marks
of
having
been
used
not
wisely
but
too
well
everything
was
clean
though
not
aggressively
so
he
ascribed
the
absence
of
lace
curtains
to
romeo
and
the
cloisonne
vase
to
juliet
the
fishing
rods
in
one
corner
were
probably
due
to
both
when
the
others
came
down
juliet
tied
a
big
blue
gingham
apron
over
her
white
muslin
gown
and
excused
herself
she
had
been
cooking
for
the
better
part
of
two
days
and
took
a
housewifely
pride
in
doing
everything
herself
they
had
chosen
the
things
they
liked
the
most
so
the
dinner
was
unusual
as
dinners
go
isabel
eating
daintily
made
no
effort
to
conceal
her
disdain
but
doctor
jack
ate
heartily
praised
everything
and
brought
the
blush
of
pleasure
to
juliet
rosy
cheeks
romeo
at
the
head
of
the
table
radiated
the
hospitality
of
the
true
host
yet
a
close
observer
would
have
noted
how
often
he
cast
admiring
glances
at
isabel
she
was
so
dainty
so
beautifully
gowned
and
elaborately
coiffured
that
romeo
compared
her
with
his
sister
greatly
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
latter
juliet
hair
was
unruly
and
broke
into
curls
all
around
her
face
isabel
was
in
perfect
order
with
every
wave
mathematically
exact
juliet
face
was
tanned
and
rosy
isabel
pale
and
cool
hands
were
rough
and
her
square
isabel
were
white
and
tapering
with
perfectly
manicured
nails
and
their
gowns
there
was
no
possible
comparison
there
both
were
in
white
but
romeo
discovered
that
there
might
be
a
vast
difference
in
white
gowns
afterward
the
guests
were
taken
out
into
the
yard
and
led
to
the
comprehensive
grave
of
the
nineteen
dogs
minerva
kept
at
a
safe
distance
but
the
five
puppies
gambolled
and
frolicked
even
to
the
verge
of
the
sepulchre
romeo
desired
to
send
a
dog
to
allison
and
generously
offered
isabel
her
choice
but
she
refused
i
take
the
pup
said
the
doctor
it
might
amuse
him
and
anyhow
he
like
to
know
that
you
thought
of
him
isabel
had
strolled
down
toward
the
barn
juliet
hesitated
duty
bidding
her
follow
isabel
and
inclination
holding
her
back
presently
isabel
returned
and
her
face
was
surprisingly
animated
is
that
our
car
in
the
barn
she
asked
her
manner
betrayed
great
excitement
why
it
allison
kent
car
is
it
inquired
romeo
i
thought
it
was
mine
colonel
kent
gave
it
to
me
for
a
wedding
present
i
thought
you
could
keep
the
wedding
presents
unless
the
wedding
came
off
juliet
observed
practically
i
still
got
my
ring
said
isabel
allison
said
he
wanted
me
to
keep
it
and
he
gave
me
his
violin
too
i
should
think
they
want
me
to
keep
the
car
better
make
sure
suggested
doctor
jack
politely
people
do
scatter
automobiles
around
carelessly
among
their
friends
as
a
general
rule
observed
juliet
i
wish
i
could
get
it
up
to
kent
romeo
said
thoughtfully
it
always
reminds
me
here
i
just
as
soon
drive
it
back
the
doctor
answered
it
more
of
a
trot
out
here
than
i
supposed
it
was
why
yes
cried
juliet
you
can
drive
it
back
and
take
isabel
home
charmed
lied
the
doctor
with
an
awkward
bow
so
it
happened
that
isabel
once
more
climbed
into
the
red
car
and
went
back
over
the
fateful
road
the
machine
ran
well
but
it
seemed
to
require
the
driver
entire
attention
for
his
conversation
consisted
of
brief
remarks
to
which
answers
even
more
brief
were
vouchsafed
when
he
turned
on
the
wide
road
in
front
of
madame
bernard
after
leaving
isabel
at
the
gate
she
lingered
in
the
shadow
watching
until
he
was
out
of
sight
the
throb
of
the
engine
became
fainter
and
fainter
then
died
away
altogether
isabel
sighed
and
went
in
wondering
if
allison
after
giving
her
the
ring
and
the
violin
would
not
also
want
her
to
have
the
car
or
if
that
seemed
too
much
and
she
should
send
back
the
violin
she
pondered
over
it
until
almost
dawn
then
went
to
sleep
the
following
afternoon
while
madame
bernard
slept
isabel
sat
idly
in
the
looking
out
of
the
window
though
as
she
told
herself
fretfully
there
was
not
much
use
of
looking
out
of
the
window
when
nobody
ever
went
by
but
no
sooner
had
she
phrased
the
thought
than
she
heard
the
faint
of
an
approaching
motor
she
moved
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
curtain
and
presently
saw
the
big
red
automobile
whizz
by
doctor
jack
hatless
and
laughing
was
at
the
wheel
beside
him
was
colonel
kent
had
they
gone
out
and
left
allison
alone
surely
since
there
was
no
one
else
fortune
favoured
her
if
she
wished
to
see
him
but
did
she
dare
isabel
was
nothing
if
not
courageous
arming
herself
with
an
excuse
in
the
shape
of
the
violin
she
sallied
forth
and
made
her
way
to
kent
meeting
no
one
upon
the
path
as
it
happened
allison
was
on
the
lower
veranda
walking
back
and
forth
persistently
accompanied
by
the
crosby
pup
assisted
by
the
colonel
and
doctor
jack
he
had
come
down
without
accident
and
had
promised
to
go
out
in
the
car
with
them
a
little
later
when
he
saw
isabel
coming
up
the
walk
he
stopped
in
astonishment
he
did
not
go
to
meet
her
but
offered
her
a
chair
and
said
with
formal
politeness
how
do
you
do
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
i
brought
this
began
isabel
offering
him
the
violin
he
took
it
with
a
smile
thank
you
i
do
know
that
i
shall
ever
use
it
again
but
i
am
glad
to
have
it
there
was
a
pause
and
isabel
moved
restlessly
in
her
chair
then
she
slipped
the
ring
from
her
finger
do
you
want
this
now
she
asked
her
face
was
a
shade
paler
allison
laughed
indeed
i
do
whom
could
i
give
it
to
rose
suggested
isabel
maliciously
allison
sighed
and
turned
his
face
away
she
would
take
it
he
said
sadly
isabel
slipped
it
back
on
her
finger
evidently
relieved
i
glad
you
better
she
went
on
clearing
her
throat
thank
you
so
am
i
i
saw
your
father
out
in
the
car
the
doctor
was
with
him
yes
they
coming
back
for
me
in
a
little
while
it
a
lovely
car
the
doctor
brought
me
home
in
it
last
night
from
crosby
so
he
told
me
allison
did
not
see
fit
to
say
just
how
much
doctor
jack
had
told
him
he
smiled
a
little
at
the
recollection
of
the
young
man
remorseful
confession
i
told
them
continued
isabel
that
i
thought
it
was
mine
that
your
father
had
given
it
to
me
but
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
it
seems
so
allison
agreed
dad
gave
it
to
the
doctor
this
morning
isabel
repressed
a
bitter
cry
of
astonishment
for
keeps
yes
for
keeps
it
little
enough
to
give
him
after
all
he
done
for
me
we
both
wanted
him
to
have
it
you
could
get
another
could
you
i
suppose
so
if
i
wanted
it
people
can
usually
get
things
they
want
if
they
are
intangible
i
wanted
to
tell
you
resumed
isabel
that
i
was
sorry
i
acted
the
way
i
did
the
last
time
i
was
here
do
think
of
it
replied
allison
kindly
it
was
very
natural
it
was
all
a
great
shock
to
me
and
i
was
lame
and
and
i
wish
everything
could
be
as
it
was
before
she
concluded
with
a
faint
flush
creeping
into
her
face
that
is
the
great
tragedy
of
life
isabel
that
things
can
never
be
as
they
were
before
sometimes
they
worse
sometimes
better
but
the
world
is
never
the
same
of
course
she
answered
without
grasping
his
meaning
but
going
to
be
all
right
again
now
and
that
the
same
allison
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
bit
his
lips
to
conceal
a
smile
it
may
be
the
same
for
me
but
it
could
be
for
you
i
could
give
you
any
guarantee
that
it
would
happen
again
you
know
i
might
be
run
over
by
a
railroad
train
or
a
trolley
car
or
any
one
of
a
thousand
things
might
happen
to
me
there
always
a
risk
tears
filled
isabel
eyes
i
do
believe
you
ever
cared
very
much
for
me
she
said
her
lips
quivering
i
did
isabel
he
answered
kindly
but
it
gone
now
even
at
that
it
lasted
longer
than
you
cared
for
me
come
let
be
friends
he
offered
his
hand
she
put
hers
into
it
for
a
moment
then
quickly
took
it
away
he
noted
that
it
was
very
cold
i
must
be
going
she
said
keeping
her
with
difficulty
aunt
francesca
will
miss
me
thank
you
for
coming
and
for
bringing
the
violin
you
welcome
silver
girl
i
hope
you
be
happy
isabel
did
not
answer
nor
turn
back
she
went
out
of
the
gate
and
out
of
his
life
pride
keeping
her
head
high
until
she
had
turned
the
corner
then
very
sorry
for
herself
she
sat
down
and
wept
xxiii
tears
idle
tears
say
jule
inquired
romeo
casually
why
is
it
that
you
do
look
like
a
lady
what
do
you
mean
demanded
juliet
bristling
i
do
know
just
what
i
mean
but
you
seem
so
different
from
everybody
else
i
clean
ai
i
yes
he
admitted
grudgingly
and
my
hair
is
combed
sometimes
and
my
white
dress
is
clean
is
it
yes
but
it
does
look
like
like
hers
you
know
her
who
you
know
isabel
juliet
sighed
and
bit
her
lips
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
winked
very
hard
to
keep
them
back
an
ominous
pain
clutched
at
her
loyal
little
heart
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
romie
she
asked
gently
why
i
do
know
men
never
know
about
such
things
just
make
yourself
like
her
that
all
huh
juliet
was
scornful
now
i
do
know
whether
i
want
to
look
like
her
or
not
she
remarked
coldly
why
not
he
flashed
back
and
i
do
want
to
be
like
her
either
she
ca
do
anything
she
ca
cook
or
swing
on
the
trapeze
or
skate
or
fish
or
row
or
swim
or
climb
a
tree
or
ride
horseback
or
walk
or
anything
i
could
teach
her
mused
romeo
half
to
himself
i
taught
you
yes
cried
juliet
swallowing
the
persistent
lump
in
her
throat
and
now
you
done
it
you
ashamed
of
me
i
did
say
so
he
temporised
you
did
have
to
do
you
suppose
i
can
see
do
get
so
mad
about
it
she
was
laughing
at
you
last
night
and
so
was
the
doctor
they
did
think
it
was
nice
for
you
to
put
on
your
knickers
and
swing
on
the
trapeze
ladies
do
do
that
you
taught
me
she
reminded
him
quickly
yes
but
i
did
ask
you
to
do
it
before
everybody
you
started
it
yourself
isabel
would
look
at
you
and
you
remember
what
the
doctor
said
do
you
he
told
you
to
cut
it
out
that
was
because
he
thought
it
was
dangerous
is
dangerous
and
he
knows
it
he
knew
it
was
refined
and
like
for
you
to
do
that
before
men
it
was
only
a
doctor
juliet
replied
in
a
small
thin
voice
different
from
other
people
i
would
let
the
kents
see
me
in
my
knickers
and
you
know
it
you
would
too
if
you
wanted
to
you
a
perfect
tomboy
you
see
isabel
doing
that
probably
not
answered
juliet
dryly
she
no
more
likely
to
do
that
than
i
would
be
to
go
back
on
the
man
i
promised
to
marry
just
because
his
hand
was
hurt
you
never
have
a
chance
to
go
back
on
anybody
so
you
do
know
what
you
do
why
wo
i
because
answered
romeo
choosing
his
words
carefully
when
a
man
gets
married
he
wants
to
marry
a
lady
not
a
tomboy
for
some
unknown
reason
he
resented
any
slur
cast
at
isabel
and
replied
juliet
cuttingly
when
a
lady
gets
married
she
wants
to
marry
a
gentleman
the
accent
carried
insult
with
it
and
romeo
left
the
house
slamming
the
door
and
whistling
defiantly
until
he
was
out
of
hearing
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
juliet
to
keep
back
the
tears
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
disembowelled
sofa
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
wept
until
she
could
weep
no
more
then
she
bathed
her
face
and
pinned
up
her
tangled
hair
and
went
to
the
one
long
mirror
the
crosby
mansion
boasted
of
to
take
an
inventory
of
herself
she
could
see
that
romeo
was
right
she
did
look
like
a
lady
her
skirt
was
too
short
and
did
hang
evenly
and
her
belt
was
wrong
because
she
had
no
corsets
juliet
made
a
wry
face
at
the
thought
of
a
corset
none
of
her
clothes
fitted
like
isabel
her
face
was
tanned
her
hands
rough
and
red
and
her
nails
impossible
i
look
just
like
a
boy
juliet
admitted
to
herself
dressed
up
in
girl
clothes
if
romie
hair
was
long
and
he
had
on
this
dress
look
just
like
me
pride
forbade
her
to
go
to
isabel
and
inquire
into
the
mysteries
of
her
femininity
anyhow
isabel
would
laugh
at
her
anybody
would
laugh
at
her
unless
miss
bernard
but
she
had
gone
away
she
was
a
lady
even
more
than
isabel
and
so
was
the
little
old
lady
everybody
called
aunt
francesca
if
she
could
see
aunt
francesca
she
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
her
what
romeo
had
said
if
she
only
knew
what
to
do
she
could
do
it
for
she
had
plenty
of
money
juliet
dimly
discerned
that
money
was
very
necessary
if
one
would
be
the
same
sort
of
lady
that
the
others
were
if
mamma
had
died
said
juliet
to
herself
i
guess
i
have
been
as
much
of
a
lady
as
anybody
and
nobody
would
have
dared
call
me
a
tomboy
her
heart
ached
for
the
gentle
little
mother
who
had
died
many
years
ago
she
would
have
known
sighed
juliet
mamma
was
a
lady
if
anybody
ever
was
and
she
did
have
the
money
we
got
either
the
life
of
the
crosbys
had
been
bare
of
luxuries
and
sometimes
even
of
comforts
until
the
considerate
uncle
died
and
left
his
money
to
the
twins
as
fortunes
go
it
was
not
much
but
it
seemed
inexhaustible
to
them
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
spend
it
i
go
this
very
day
thought
juliet
and
see
aunt
francesca
ask
her
if
isabel
is
there
i
have
to
wait
but
if
i
do
ask
for
isabel
maybe
i
wo
see
her
having
decided
upon
a
plan
of
action
the
way
seemed
easier
so
juliet
went
about
her
daily
duties
with
a
lighter
heart
and
even
sang
after
a
fashion
as
she
awkwardly
pressed
the
wrinkles
from
her
white
muslin
gown
though
it
was
september
it
was
still
warm
enough
to
wear
it
romeo
having
only
the
day
before
attained
his
maturity
had
taken
unto
himself
the
masculine
privilege
of
getting
angry
at
someone
else
for
what
he
himself
had
done
he
was
furious
with
juliet
though
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
ask
why
the
idea
he
muttered
of
her
criticising
isabel
his
wounded
sensibilities
impelled
him
to
walk
past
the
bernard
house
very
slowly
two
or
three
times
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
went
to
the
as
a
mere
matter
of
habit
there
was
seldom
any
mail
for
the
crosbys
except
on
the
first
of
the
month
when
the
formal
note
enclosing
remittance
came
duly
to
hand
nobody
seemed
to
be
around
there
was
nothing
to
do
it
would
have
been
natural
to
go
back
home
but
he
was
too
angry
for
that
and
inwardly
vowed
to
stay
away
long
enough
to
bring
juliet
to
her
senses
he
recalled
the
night
he
had
called
upon
isabel
and
had
not
reached
home
until
late
he
remembered
the
torrent
of
tears
and
juliet
cry
oh
romie
romie
i
do
care
where
you
been
as
long
as
i
got
you
back
it
pleased
his
masculine
sense
of
superiority
to
know
that
he
had
power
over
a
woman
tears
to
make
them
come
or
go
as
he
chose
he
sauntered
slowly
toward
kent
thinking
that
he
might
while
away
an
hour
or
two
there
it
was
a
long
time
until
midnight
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
and
wait
he
could
ask
about
the
car
and
whether
it
was
all
right
now
if
doctor
jack
could
run
it
maybe
they
could
go
out
together
for
a
little
spin
it
would
be
nice
to
go
by
his
own
house
and
never
even
turn
his
head
and
if
they
could
get
isabel
to
go
too
it
would
teach
juliet
a
lesson
he
had
nearly
reached
his
destination
when
he
came
upon
the
picture
of
beauty
in
distress
isabel
sat
at
the
roadside
leaning
against
a
tree
sobbing
romeo
gave
a
long
low
whistle
of
astonishment
say
he
called
cheerfully
what
wrong
isabel
looked
up
wiped
her
eyes
and
began
to
weep
more
earnestly
though
juliet
tears
had
moved
him
to
anger
and
disdain
isabel
grief
roused
all
his
chivalry
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
tried
to
take
her
handkerchief
away
from
her
eyes
do
he
said
softly
what
the
matter
oh
sobbed
isabel
i
the
most
miserable
girl
in
the
whole
world
nobody
wants
me
what
makes
you
say
that
demanded
romeo
look
here
if
you
tell
me
who
been
making
you
cry
i
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
his
tone
indicated
that
dire
misfortune
would
be
visited
upon
the
luckless
individual
directly
responsible
for
isabel
tears
you
know
began
isabel
after
her
sobs
had
quieted
somewhat
i
was
engaged
to
allison
kent
until
you
ran
over
us
at
first
i
could
go
over
i
was
so
bruised
and
lame
and
before
i
was
well
enough
to
go
i
got
a
note
from
him
releasing
me
from
the
engagement
yes
queried
romeo
encouragingly
go
on
well
i
did
think
i
ought
to
go
over
under
the
circumstances
but
aunt
francesca
made
me
go
she
been
mean
to
me
too
so
i
went
and
he
was
horrid
to
me
perfectly
horrid
i
offered
him
his
ring
and
he
almost
threw
his
violin
at
me
and
told
me
to
keep
that
too
i
was
afraid
of
him
well
since
that
everything
has
been
awful
i
wrote
to
mamma
and
told
her
about
it
and
that
i
could
stay
here
any
longer
and
she
answer
for
a
long
time
then
she
said
i
would
have
to
stay
where
i
was
until
she
could
make
new
arrangements
for
me
and
that
she
was
glad
i
was
going
to
marry
a
cripple
she
said
something
about
survival
of
the
unfit
but
i
did
understand
it
and
then
last
night
when
i
heard
that
allison
was
going
to
lose
his
hand
after
all
i
thought
i
ought
to
take
his
violin
back
to
him
and
try
to
well
to
make
up
you
know
so
i
just
been
there
he
took
the
violin
all
right
but
he
did
seem
to
want
me
he
said
nothing
could
ever
be
as
it
was
before
i
was
ready
to
get
married
and
go
away
i
do
almost
anything
for
a
change
but
he
actually
seemed
to
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
and
they
given
my
automobile
that
colonel
kent
himself
gave
to
me
for
a
wedding
present
to
that
doctor
who
was
out
to
your
house
last
night
oh
sobbed
isabel
i
wish
i
was
dead
if
you
only
had
run
over
us
everything
would
have
been
all
right
romeo
young
face
was
set
in
stern
and
unaccustomed
lines
he
then
was
directly
responsible
for
isabel
tears
he
had
run
over
them
and
hurt
isabel
and
made
everything
wrong
for
her
and
because
she
was
a
lady
she
was
blaming
him
in
the
least
she
had
merely
pointed
out
to
him
as
gently
as
she
could
what
he
had
done
to
her
a
bright
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
as
he
remembered
that
he
was
now
and
could
do
as
he
pleased
without
consulting
anybody
he
reached
into
his
pocket
drew
out
a
handful
of
greenbacks
and
silver
even
a
gold
piece
or
two
it
would
serve
juliet
just
right
and
make
up
to
isabel
for
what
he
had
done
i
say
isabel
he
began
awkwardly
would
you
be
willing
to
marry
me
isabel
quickly
dried
her
tears
why
i
do
know
she
answered
much
astonished
then
the
practical
side
of
her
nature
asserted
itself
have
you
got
money
enough
romeo
tendered
the
handful
of
currency
all
this
and
plenty
more
in
the
bank
i
know
but
it
was
the
bank
i
was
talking
about
have
you
got
enough
for
us
to
live
at
a
nice
hotel
and
go
to
the
theatre
every
night
more
than
that
romeo
asserted
confidently
i
got
loads
i
do
know
said
isabel
half
to
herself
it
would
serve
them
all
right
allison
used
to
be
jealous
of
you
she
added
with
a
sidelong
glance
that
set
his
youthful
heart
to
fluttering
juliet
is
jealous
of
you
romeo
responded
disloyally
we
had
an
awful
scrap
this
morning
because
i
asked
her
why
she
did
try
to
be
a
lady
like
you
of
course
replied
isabel
smoothing
her
gown
with
a
dainty
hand
i
always
liked
juliet
but
i
liked
you
better
really
isabel
did
you
always
like
me
always
then
come
on
let
skip
out
now
the
way
they
do
in
the
books
take
the
next
train
why
not
get
married
here
objected
isabel
practically
and
take
the
into
town
there
a
minister
here
and
while
you
seeing
about
it
i
can
go
home
and
get
my
coat
all
right
but
do
stop
for
anything
else
we
got
to
hustle
tell
anybody
not
even
aunt
francesca
no
she
make
a
fuss
and
besides
she
does
deserve
it
if
been
mean
to
you
romeo
leaned
over
and
bestowed
a
meaningless
peck
upon
the
fair
cheek
of
his
betrothed
i
never
be
mean
to
you
he
said
i
know
you
wo
isabel
returned
trustfully
then
she
laughed
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
it
will
be
a
good
joke
on
allison
she
said
gleefully
it
be
a
good
joke
on
everybody
romeo
agreed
happily
listen
said
isabel
a
faint
was
heard
in
the
distance
gradually
coming
nearer
it
my
car
i
wish
you
had
been
so
quick
to
get
rid
of
it
last
night
we
could
have
gone
away
in
it
now
never
mind
i
buy
you
another
they
hoped
to
reach
the
turn
in
the
road
before
the
car
got
there
but
failed
doctor
jack
came
to
a
dead
stop
want
a
lift
he
asked
no
thank
you
said
romeo
no
thank
you
repeated
isabel
primly
colonel
kent
had
greeted
her
with
the
most
chilling
politeness
and
she
burned
to
get
away
say
resumed
romeo
will
you
do
something
for
me
sure
replied
the
doctor
cordially
anything
will
you
take
a
note
out
to
my
sister
for
me
i
sha
get
back
for
some
time
you
bet
where
is
it
i
have
written
it
yet
just
wait
a
minute
romeo
tore
a
leaf
from
an
old
memorandum
book
which
he
carried
and
wrote
rapidly
dear
jule
isabel
and
i
have
gone
away
to
get
married
you
can
have
half
of
everything
i
let
you
know
where
to
send
my
clothes
he
was
tempted
to
add
an
apology
for
what
he
had
said
earlier
in
the
day
but
his
newly
acquired
importance
made
him
refrain
from
anything
so
compromising
he
folded
the
note
into
a
little
cocked
hat
and
addressed
it
much
obliged
he
said
laconically
so
long
so
long
returned
doctor
jack
starting
the
engine
said
the
colonel
lifting
his
hat
romeo
left
isabel
at
madame
bernard
gate
hurry
up
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
meet
you
under
the
big
elm
down
the
road
all
right
she
whispered
madame
bernard
was
asleep
so
isabel
hastily
crammed
a
few
things
into
a
and
slipped
out
of
the
house
unseen
and
unheard
as
the
starved
minister
of
the
country
parish
was
sorely
in
need
of
the
generous
fee
romeo
pressed
upon
him
in
advance
the
arrangements
were
pitifully
easy
he
was
at
the
trysting
place
fully
ten
minutes
before
she
came
in
sight
staggering
under
the
unaccustomed
burden
of
a
heavy
it
might
not
have
occurred
to
him
to
relieve
juliet
of
a
cumbrous
piece
of
baggage
but
he
instinctively
took
it
from
isabel
come
on
he
said
we
got
to
hurry
if
we
do
want
to
miss
the
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
married
queried
isabel
not
long
i
guess
see
how
people
fool
around
over
it
and
getting
through
with
it
in
one
afternoon
we
making
a
record
i
guess
it
seemed
that
they
were
for
when
they
came
to
the
shabby
little
brown
house
near
the
big
white
church
the
minister
his
wife
and
a
door
neighbour
were
waiting
in
a
very
short
time
the
ceremony
was
over
and
and
romeo
crosby
were
on
the
train
speeding
toward
their
honeymoon
and
the
lively
years
that
undoubtedly
lay
ahead
of
them
allison
had
changed
his
mind
about
going
out
that
afternoon
but
promised
to
go
next
time
colonel
kent
remained
at
home
and
doctor
jack
sped
away
alone
upon
his
errand
when
he
reached
crosby
juliet
clad
in
her
best
was
just
leaving
the
house
she
was
outwardly
cheerful
but
her
face
still
bore
traces
of
tears
where
were
you
going
asked
the
doctor
as
juliet
greeted
him
there
was
a
new
shyness
in
her
manner
as
of
some
unwonted
restraint
i
was
going
into
town
i
wanted
to
see
aunt
francesca
she
slipped
easily
into
the
habit
of
the
others
seldom
hearing
the
name
madame
bernard
i
take
you
here
a
note
from
your
brother
juliet
opened
it
read
the
fateful
message
and
turned
white
as
death
what
is
it
asked
the
doctor
much
alarmed
in
answer
she
offered
him
the
note
her
hand
shaking
pitifully
the
doctor
read
it
twice
before
he
grasped
the
full
meaning
of
it
well
i
be
he
said
half
to
himself
unable
to
stand
juliet
sat
down
upon
the
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
it
all
my
fault
she
said
solemnly
romie
told
me
this
morning
that
i
was
a
lady
and
he
wanted
me
to
be
like
her
he
said
i
was
a
tomboy
and
i
told
him
that
if
i
was
he
done
it
himself
and
he
got
mad
and
went
away
and
now
juliet
burst
into
tears
but
she
had
no
handkerchief
so
doctor
jack
gave
her
his
idle
tears
he
quoted
lightly
i
say
kid
do
take
it
so
hard
i
i
not
a
lady
she
sobbed
you
are
he
assured
her
you
the
finest
little
lady
i
know
do
do
she
sobbed
do
make
fun
of
me
romie
said
that
you
were
laughing
at
me
i
was
a
a
tomboy
kid
he
said
softly
almost
unmanned
by
a
sudden
tenderness
quite
foreign
to
his
experience
oh
my
dear
little
girl
wo
you
look
at
me
the
tone
was
wholly
new
to
juliet
she
did
not
know
that
any
man
could
be
so
tender
so
beautifully
kind
it
because
he
a
doctor
she
thought
he
used
to
seeing
people
when
they
do
feel
right
i
so
sorry
he
was
saying
your
brother
did
mean
anything
by
it
little
girl
he
was
just
teasing
he
was
returned
juliet
wiping
her
eyes
do
you
think
i
know
when
he
teasing
and
when
he
is
i
not
a
lady
i
only
a
tomboy
and
now
he
gone
away
with
her
and
left
me
all
alone
you
never
be
alone
if
i
can
help
it
he
assured
her
fervently
look
here
do
you
suppose
you
could
ever
learn
to
like
me
why
i
like
you
now
i
always
liked
you
i
know
but
i
do
mean
that
do
you
think
you
could
ever
like
me
a
whole
lot
enough
to
marry
me
i
mean
why
i
do
know
i
never
thought
juliet
voice
trailed
off
into
an
inarticulate
murmur
of
astonishment
wo
you
try
he
pleaded
oh
juliet
i
loved
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
the
high
colour
surged
into
her
face
he
was
not
joking
he
meant
every
word
even
juliet
could
see
that
wo
you
try
dear
that
all
i
ask
for
now
why
yes
she
said
her
wide
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
his
i
try
almost
anything
for
you
but
i
only
a
tomboy
doctor
jack
caught
her
cold
little
hands
in
his
kiss
me
he
said
huskily
juliet
face
burned
but
she
lifted
her
lips
to
his
obediently
and
simply
as
a
child
the
man
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
pushed
her
away
from
him
not
unkindly
but
firmly
no
i
wo
take
it
princess
he
said
in
a
strange
tone
i
wait
until
you
wake
up
i
not
asleep
she
stammered
you
are
in
some
ways
then
he
added
irrelevantly
thank
god
i
do
know
remarked
juliet
at
the
end
of
an
uncomfortable
pause
what
to
do
with
myself
i
do
want
to
stay
here
alone
and
i
go
anywhere
near
them
not
for
the
world
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
when
i
came
to
aunt
francesca
madame
bernard
you
know
good
business
he
answered
nodding
vigorous
approval
come
on
she
seems
to
be
the
unfailing
refuge
of
the
shipwrecked
mariner
in
this
district
if
i
not
much
mistaken
she
take
you
into
her
big
house
and
her
bigger
heart
oh
said
juliet
wistfully
do
you
think
she
would
take
me
and
make
me
into
a
lady
i
think
she
take
you
he
responded
after
a
brief
struggle
with
himself
but
i
do
want
you
made
over
i
want
you
to
stay
just
exactly
as
you
are
oh
you
dear
little
kid
he
muttered
you
try
to
care
wo
you
i
try
she
promised
sweetly
as
she
climbed
into
the
big
red
machine
i
did
think
i
ever
be
in
this
car
you
can
come
whenever
you
like
it
mine
now
juliet
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
car
hummed
along
the
dusty
road
making
a
soothing
purring
noise
pensively
she
looked
across
the
distant
fields
whence
came
the
hum
and
whir
of
reaping
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
that
the
man
beside
her
was
powerless
to
understand
she
was
making
swift
readjustments
as
best
she
might
and
wisely
he
left
her
to
herself
as
they
approached
madame
bernard
juliet
turned
to
him
i
was
just
thinking
she
sighed
how
quickly
you
grow
up
after
you
get
to
be
he
made
no
answer
he
swallowed
hard
and
turned
the
car
into
the
driveway
aunt
francesca
came
out
on
the
veranda
followed
by
boffin
as
juliet
jumped
out
of
the
car
she
had
the
crumpled
note
in
her
cold
little
hand
without
a
word
she
offered
it
to
madame
bernard
and
waited
the
beautiful
face
instantly
became
soft
with
pity
my
dear
child
she
breathed
my
dear
little
motherless
child
juliet
went
into
her
open
arms
as
straight
as
a
homing
pigeon
to
its
nest
oh
aunt
francesca
she
sobbed
will
you
take
me
and
make
a
lady
out
of
me
you
already
a
lady
laughed
the
older
woman
amid
her
tears
come
in
juliet
dear
come
home
xxiv
the
house
where
love
lived
it
was
past
the
middle
of
october
and
allison
injured
hand
was
not
only
free
of
its
bandages
but
he
had
partially
regained
the
use
of
it
doctor
jack
still
lingered
eagerly
seizing
every
excuse
that
presented
itself
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
back
looking
for
another
job
he
regretfully
observed
to
allison
but
i
like
it
here
and
besides
i
want
to
hear
you
play
on
your
fiddle
before
i
go
allison
laughed
and
hospitably
urged
him
to
stay
as
long
as
he
chose
colonel
kent
added
heartily
after
an
old
southern
fashion
my
house
is
yours
crimson
and
golden
leaves
rained
from
the
maples
and
the
purple
winds
of
autumn
swept
them
into
drifts
at
the
roadside
amethystine
haze
shimmered
in
the
valleys
and
lay
upon
the
distant
hills
through
the
long
aisles
of
trees
a
fairy
patter
of
tiny
furred
feet
rustled
back
and
forth
upon
the
fallen
leaves
only
a
dropping
nut
or
a
busy
squirrel
broke
the
exquisite
peace
of
the
forest
where
the
myriad
life
of
the
woods
waited
in
hushed
expectancy
for
the
tide
of
the
year
to
turn
like
a
scarlet
shuttle
plying
through
the
web
of
autumn
the
big
red
touring
car
hummed
and
whirred
with
a
happy
young
man
at
the
wheel
and
a
laughing
girl
beside
him
juliet
momentary
was
gone
and
she
was
her
sunny
self
again
though
she
still
occasionally
wept
in
secret
longing
for
her
brother
aunt
francesca
she
said
one
day
when
the
two
were
sewing
on
dainty
garments
destined
to
adorn
juliet
do
you
think
romie
will
ever
come
back
to
me
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
dear
replied
madame
gently
we
live
in
a
world
of
change
and
things
are
never
the
same
even
from
day
to
day
she
made
him
think
i
was
a
tomboy
and
now
she
teach
him
not
to
love
me
why
does
she
want
everything
some
women
do
when
they
marry
many
are
not
content
to
be
sweetheart
and
wife
but
must
take
the
place
of
mother
and
sisters
too
but
remember
juliet
when
a
woman
closes
a
man
heart
against
those
of
his
own
blood
the
one
door
she
has
left
open
will
some
day
be
slammed
in
her
own
face
and
then
then
the
other
doors
will
swing
ajar
turning
slowly
on
rusty
hinges
but
the
women
for
whom
they
are
opened
will
never
cross
the
threshold
again
why
because
they
have
ceased
to
care
there
is
nothing
so
dead
as
a
dead
love
when
the
fire
goes
out
and
no
single
ember
is
left
the
ashes
are
past
the
power
of
flame
to
rekindle
do
you
think
that
after
a
while
i
wo
care
for
romie
any
more
not
as
you
used
to
that
is
impossible
even
now
juliet
sighed
and
hastily
wiped
away
a
tear
with
a
quick
sure
stroke
her
life
seemed
to
have
been
divided
do
dear
remember
what
you
have
had
i
often
think
a
woman
has
crossed
the
line
between
youth
and
maturity
when
she
begins
to
put
away
in
the
lavender
of
memory
the
lovely
things
she
has
had
and
is
never
to
have
again
the
after
years
are
made
up
so
many
times
of
things
one
has
had
rounded
off
and
put
away
forever
i
know
returned
juliet
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
i
remember
the
day
i
grew
up
almost
the
hour
it
was
the
day
i
came
here
madame
stooped
to
kiss
the
girl
rosy
cheek
then
swiftly
turned
the
talk
to
linen
and
lace
always
quick
to
observe
juliet
had
acquired
little
graces
of
tone
and
manner
softened
her
abruptness
and
guided
by
loving
tact
had
begun
to
bloom
like
a
primrose
in
a
sunny
window
when
when
miss
bernard
comes
back
again
asked
juliet
wistfully
shall
i
have
to
go
no
dear
indeed
no
this
is
your
home
until
the
right
man
comes
wooing
and
takes
you
to
a
little
house
of
your
own
scarlet
signals
flamed
in
juliet
cheeks
as
she
earnestly
devoted
herself
to
her
sewing
and
madame
smiled
already
in
quiet
moments
she
had
planned
a
pretty
wedding
gown
for
juliet
and
a
still
prettier
wedding
allison
came
frequently
sometimes
alone
and
sometimes
with
his
father
or
doctor
jack
he
had
remarked
once
that
when
he
desired
to
consult
his
physician
he
always
knew
where
to
find
him
madame
affected
not
to
notice
that
a
strange
young
man
had
become
a
veritable
part
of
her
family
for
she
liked
doctor
jack
and
made
him
very
welcome
morning
noon
and
night
on
wednesdays
the
men
of
the
other
household
dined
with
her
saturdays
she
and
juliet
were
honoured
guests
at
the
colonel
though
he
deprecated
his
own
hospitality
a
house
needs
a
woman
at
the
head
of
it
he
said
it
was
different
when
miss
rose
was
here
indeed
it
was
thought
allison
though
he
did
not
put
it
into
words
at
the
end
of
the
month
when
it
was
cool
enough
to
make
an
open
fire
seem
the
most
cheerful
of
companions
madame
had
them
all
at
her
own
table
juliet
was
surpassingly
lovely
in
her
first
long
gown
of
tinted
chiffon
ornamented
only
by
hand
embroidery
and
a
bit
of
toned
lace
her
wavy
hair
was
gathered
into
a
loose
knot
from
which
tiny
tendrils
escaped
to
cling
about
her
face
madame
had
put
a
pink
rose
into
her
hair
slipped
another
into
her
belt
and
had
been
well
pleased
with
the
work
of
her
own
hands
after
dinner
while
juliet
played
piquet
with
the
colonel
and
doctor
jack
sat
quietly
in
the
shadow
where
he
could
watch
every
play
of
light
and
shade
upon
the
girl
lovely
changing
face
allison
drew
madame
into
the
library
and
quietly
closed
the
door
aunt
francesca
he
said
without
preliminary
i
been
more
kinds
of
a
fool
in
a
few
months
than
most
men
can
manage
to
be
in
a
lifetime
yes
madame
agreed
with
a
cool
little
smile
where
is
rose
he
demanded
rose
replied
madame
lightly
has
gone
away
i
know
that
he
flashed
back
i
realise
it
every
day
and
every
hour
of
my
life
i
asked
where
she
was
and
i
answered
madame
imperturbably
have
told
you
she
is
simply
is
she
well
yes
is
she
happy
of
course
why
not
beauty
health
talent
sufficient
income
love
what
more
can
a
woman
desire
aunt
francesca
tell
me
please
where
is
rose
when
i
was
married
answered
madame
idly
fingering
an
ivory
paper
knife
i
went
to
live
in
a
little
house
in
the
woods
yes
where
is
rose
it
was
only
a
tiny
place
but
a
brook
sang
in
front
of
it
night
and
day
must
have
been
pretty
where
did
rose
go
it
was
very
quiet
there
it
would
have
been
a
good
place
to
work
if
either
of
us
had
been
musical
or
anything
of
that
sort
charming
replied
allison
absently
it
was
far
from
town
either
we
could
take
a
train
at
two
and
reach
holly
springs
a
little
after
three
it
was
half
a
mile
up
the
main
road
from
the
station
and
as
we
had
no
horse
we
always
walked
nice
walk
said
allison
dejectedly
i
have
never
been
back
since
since
i
was
left
alone
sometimes
i
have
thought
my
little
house
ought
to
have
someone
to
look
after
it
a
house
gets
lonely
too
with
no
one
to
care
for
it
i
suppose
so
is
rose
coming
back
i
have
often
thought
of
the
little
summer
cottages
huddled
together
like
frightened
children
when
the
life
and
laughter
had
gone
and
winter
was
swiftly
approaching
how
cold
their
walls
must
be
and
how
empty
the
heart
of
a
little
house
when
there
is
no
fire
there
so
like
a
woman
when
love
has
gone
out
of
her
life
allison
sighed
and
began
to
sharpen
his
pencil
madame
observed
that
his
hands
were
trembling
i
see
he
said
i
do
deserve
to
know
where
she
is
and
rose
does
want
me
chasing
after
her
never
mind
i
had
it
coming
to
me
i
guess
what
a
hopeless
idiot
i
been
yes
agreed
madame
cordially
carlyle
says
that
is
no
other
entirely
fatal
person
something
in
her
tone
gave
him
courage
for
another
question
once
for
all
aunt
francesca
will
you
tell
me
where
rose
is
george
washington
was
a
great
man
madame
observed
he
never
told
a
lie
if
he
had
promised
not
to
tell
anything
he
never
told
it
then
she
added
with
swift
irrelevance
this
used
to
be
a
very
pleasant
time
of
the
year
at
holly
springs
a
great
light
broke
in
upon
allison
aunt
francesca
he
cried
he
put
his
arms
around
her
lifted
her
from
her
chair
and
nearly
smothered
her
in
a
embrace
god
bless
you
he
has
murmured
madame
disengaging
herself
my
foster
son
has
been
a
dunce
but
his
reason
is
now
restored
the
two
train
to
holly
springs
did
not
leave
town
until
three
so
allison
waited
for
an
hour
in
the
station
fuming
with
impatience
both
colonel
kent
and
the
doctor
had
offered
to
accompany
him
individually
or
together
but
he
had
brusquely
put
them
aside
do
worry
he
said
my
name
and
address
are
in
my
pocket
and
also
inside
my
hat
i
check
my
grip
and
be
tenderly
considerate
of
my
left
hand
when
he
had
gone
colonel
kent
anxiously
turned
to
the
doctor
where
do
you
suppose
and
why
cherchez
la
femme
returned
the
doctor
what
makes
you
think
so
it
not
it
about
the
only
errand
a
man
can
go
on
and
not
be
willing
to
take
another
chap
along
and
i
bet
anything
i
got
except
my
girl
and
my
that
it
is
the
fair
false
one
we
met
at
the
hour
of
her
elopement
must
be
rose
then
said
the
colonel
half
to
himself
but
i
thought
nobody
knew
where
she
was
love
will
find
a
way
hummed
doctor
jack
i
suppose
you
do
care
to
go
for
a
ride
this
afternoon
not
i
laughed
the
colonel
why
do
you
take
juliet
all
right
since
you
ask
me
to
i
wonder
he
continued
to
himself
as
he
went
toward
madame
bernard
at
the
highest
rate
of
speed
just
how
a
fellow
would
go
to
work
to
find
a
woman
who
had
left
no
address
sixth
sense
i
suppose
or
perhaps
seventh
or
eighth
yet
allison
was
doing
very
well
with
only
the
five
senses
of
the
normal
human
being
to
aid
him
in
his
search
he
left
the
train
at
the
sleepy
little
place
known
as
holly
springs
and
walked
up
the
main
road
as
though
he
knew
the
way
half
a
mile
he
said
to
himself
and
a
little
brown
house
in
the
woods
with
a
brook
singing
in
front
of
it
ought
to
get
to
it
pretty
soon
the
prattling
brook
was
half
asleep
in
its
narrow
channel
but
the
gentle
murmur
was
audible
to
one
who
stopped
in
the
road
to
listen
it
did
not
cross
the
road
but
turned
away
frightened
from
the
dusty
highway
of
a
modest
civilisation
and
went
back
into
the
woods
where
it
met
another
brook
and
travelled
to
the
river
in
company
the
house
just
back
of
the
singing
stream
was
a
little
place
as
madame
bernard
had
said
but
though
he
rapped
repeatedly
no
one
answered
so
he
lifted
the
latch
and
cautiously
stepped
in
a
grand
piano
unblushingly
new
and
evidently
of
recent
importation
from
the
city
occupied
most
of
the
tiny
the
embers
of
a
wood
fire
lay
on
the
hearth
and
the
room
was
faintly
scented
with
the
sweet
smoke
of
hard
pine
a
and
sonata
was
on
the
music
rack
a
volume
of
chopin
had
fallen
to
the
floor
allison
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
its
place
on
the
piano
was
some
of
his
own
music
stamped
with
his
berlin
address
a
familiar
hat
trimmed
with
crushed
roses
lay
on
the
window
seat
the
faint
indefinable
scent
of
attar
of
roses
was
dimly
to
be
discerned
as
a
sort
of
background
for
the
fragrant
smoke
an
open
book
lay
face
downward
on
the
table
a
bit
of
dainty
needlework
was
thrown
carelessly
across
the
chair
an
envelope
addressed
to
madame
francesca
bernard
was
on
the
writing
desk
and
a
single
page
of
paper
lay
near
it
bearing
in
a
familiar
hand
my
dearest
the
two
words
filled
allison
with
panic
not
knowing
how
rose
was
wont
to
address
the
little
old
lady
they
both
loved
he
conjured
up
the
forbidding
spectre
of
the
other
man
that
had
haunted
him
for
weeks
past
sighing
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
drum
idly
with
one
hand
wonder
if
i
could
use
the
other
he
thought
pretty
stiff
i
guess
he
began
to
play
from
memory
illustration
musical
notation
and
outside
a
woman
paused
almost
at
the
threshold
with
her
hands
upon
her
heart
in
a
sudden
throb
of
pain
the
old
days
came
back
she
saw
herself
at
the
piano
aching
with
love
and
longing
while
just
beyond
in
an
old
moonlit
garden
allison
made
love
to
isabel
illustration
musical
notation
was
it
a
ghost
or
was
it
no
she
was
only
foolish
aunt
francesca
had
promised
not
to
tell
and
she
never
broke
her
word
besides
why
should
he
seek
her
illustration
musical
notation
it
only
someone
who
has
stopped
in
passing
rose
thought
to
ask
the
way
to
the
next
town
or
to
get
a
glass
of
water
or
i
wo
be
foolish
i
go
in
so
she
crossed
the
threshold
into
the
house
where
love
lived
at
the
sound
of
her
step
the
man
turned
quickly
the
music
ending
in
a
broken
chord
you
she
gasped
oh
how
could
you
come
by
train
answered
allison
gently
and
then
by
walking
frightened
you
rose
no
she
stammered
sinking
into
a
chair
i
i
surprised
of
course
i
glad
you
well
enough
to
be
about
again
did
is
anything
wrong
with
aunt
francesca
she
asked
anxiously
indeed
there
is
she
was
blooming
like
a
lilac
bush
in
may
when
i
saw
her
last
night
she
tell
you
she
did
not
he
returned
concisely
then
how
how
i
just
came
what
made
you
think
you
could
get
away
from
me
i
was
getting
away
she
returned
with
difficulty
i
was
just
tired
and
i
came
here
to
to
rest
and
to
work
she
concluded
lamely
you
did
need
me
not
need
you
he
cried
stretching
his
trembling
hands
toward
her
oh
rose
i
need
you
always
slowly
the
colour
ebbed
from
her
face
leaving
her
white
to
the
lips
do
she
said
pitifully
oh
i
know
he
flashed
back
bitterly
i
lost
any
shadow
of
right
i
might
ever
have
had
because
i
was
a
blind
fool
and
i
never
had
any
chance
anyway
all
i
can
do
is
to
go
on
loving
you
needing
you
wanting
you
seeing
your
face
before
me
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
thirsting
for
you
with
every
fibre
of
me
all
i
have
to
keep
is
an
empty
husk
of
memory
those
few
weeks
you
were
kind
to
me
at
least
i
had
you
with
me
though
your
heart
belonged
to
someone
else
someone
else
she
repeated
curiously
the
colour
was
coming
back
slowly
now
yes
have
you
forgotten
you
told
me
that
day
do
you
remember
you
said
you
had
loved
another
man
who
did
not
care
for
you
rose
nodded
her
face
was
like
a
crimson
flower
swaying
on
a
slender
stem
i
said
she
began
that
i
had
loved
a
man
who
did
not
care
for
me
and
that
i
always
would
was
that
it
something
like
that
i
wish
to
god
i
could
change
places
with
him
did
i
hesitated
rose
are
you
sure
that
i
said
another
man
or
was
it
just
a
man
rose
what
do
you
mean
covered
with
lovely
confusion
she
stumbled
over
to
the
window
where
she
might
hide
her
burning
face
from
him
do
you
think
she
asked
unsteadily
that
it
is
beautiful
here
this
is
aunt
francesca
little
house
where
she
came
when
she
was
first
married
she
always
calls
it
little
house
where
love
lived
and
i
came
here
she
went
on
courageously
because
in
a
house
where
love
had
lived
i
thought
there
might
be
some
for
her
voice
trailed
off
into
an
indistinct
murmur
rose
cried
allison
could
you
give
me
just
what
i
had
before
could
we
go
back
and
never
mind
the
other
man
there
never
any
going
back
she
answered
in
a
whisper
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
because
he
was
so
near
and
did
i
say
are
you
sure
i
said
another
man
rose
rose
look
at
me
tell
me
for
god
sake
who
he
was
or
is
i
ca
bear
it
she
turned
toward
him
look
she
said
softly
look
in
my
face
and
see
for
a
tense
instant
he
hesitated
then
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
he
clasped
her
close
forever
having
seen
his
own
face
mirrored
in
her
happy
eyes
the
end
