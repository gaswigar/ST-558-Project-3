preface
the
idea
of
writing
mary
prince
history
was
first
suggested
by
herself
she
wished
it
to
be
done
she
said
that
good
people
in
england
might
hear
from
a
slave
what
a
slave
had
felt
and
suffered
and
a
letter
of
her
late
master
which
will
be
found
in
the
supplement
induced
me
to
accede
to
her
wish
without
farther
delay
the
more
immediate
object
of
the
publication
will
afterwards
appear
the
narrative
was
taken
down
from
mary
own
lips
by
a
lady
who
happened
to
be
at
the
time
residing
in
my
family
as
a
visitor
it
was
written
out
fully
with
all
the
narrator
repetitions
and
prolixities
and
afterwards
pruned
into
its
present
shape
retaining
as
far
as
was
practicable
mary
exact
expressions
and
peculiar
phraseology
no
fact
of
importance
has
been
omitted
and
not
a
single
circumstance
or
sentiment
has
been
added
it
is
essentially
her
own
without
any
material
alteration
farther
than
was
requisite
to
exclude
redundancies
and
gross
grammatical
errors
so
as
to
render
it
clearly
intelligible
after
it
had
been
thus
written
out
i
went
over
the
whole
carefully
examining
her
on
every
fact
and
circumstance
detailed
and
in
all
that
relates
to
her
residence
in
antigua
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
assisted
in
this
scrutiny
by
joseph
phillips
who
was
a
resident
in
that
colony
during
the
same
period
and
had
known
her
there
the
names
of
all
the
persons
mentioned
by
the
narrator
have
been
printed
in
full
except
those
of
capt
i
and
his
wife
and
that
of
d
to
whom
conduct
of
peculiar
atrocity
is
ascribed
these
three
individuals
are
now
gone
to
answer
at
a
far
more
awful
tribunal
than
that
of
public
opinion
for
the
deeds
of
which
their
former
bondwoman
accuses
them
and
to
hold
them
up
more
openly
to
human
reprobation
could
no
longer
affect
themselves
while
it
might
deeply
lacerate
the
feelings
of
their
surviving
and
perhaps
innocent
relatives
without
any
commensurate
public
advantage
without
detaining
the
reader
with
remarks
on
other
points
which
will
be
adverted
to
more
conveniently
in
the
supplement
i
shall
here
merely
notice
farther
that
the
society
have
no
concern
whatever
with
this
publication
nor
are
they
in
any
degree
responsible
for
the
statements
it
contains
i
have
published
the
tract
not
as
their
secretary
but
in
my
private
capacity
and
any
profits
that
may
arise
from
the
sale
will
be
exclusively
appropriated
to
the
benefit
of
mary
prince
herself
tho
pringle
solly
terrace
claremont
since
writing
the
above
i
have
been
furnished
by
my
friend
george
stephen
with
the
interesting
narrative
of
a
captured
african
now
under
his
protection
and
have
printed
it
as
a
suitable
appendix
to
this
little
history
the
history
of
mary
prince
a
west
indian
slave
related
by
herself
i
was
born
at
in
bermuda
on
a
farm
belonging
to
charles
myners
my
mother
was
a
household
slave
and
my
father
whose
name
was
prince
was
a
sawyer
belonging
to
trimmingham
a
at
when
i
was
an
infant
old
myners
died
and
there
was
a
division
of
the
slaves
and
other
property
among
the
family
i
was
bought
along
with
my
mother
by
old
captain
darrel
and
given
to
his
grandchild
little
miss
betsey
williams
captain
williams
darrel
was
master
of
a
vessel
which
traded
to
several
places
in
america
and
the
west
indies
and
he
was
seldom
at
home
long
together
williams
was
a
good
woman
and
she
treated
all
her
slaves
well
she
had
only
one
daughter
miss
betsey
for
whom
i
was
purchased
and
who
was
about
my
own
age
i
was
made
quite
a
pet
of
by
miss
betsey
and
loved
her
very
much
she
used
to
lead
me
about
by
the
hand
and
call
me
her
little
nigger
this
was
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
for
i
was
too
young
to
understand
rightly
my
condition
as
a
slave
and
too
thoughtless
and
full
of
spirits
to
look
forward
to
the
days
of
toil
and
sorrow
my
mother
was
a
household
slave
in
the
same
family
i
was
under
her
own
care
and
my
little
brothers
and
sisters
were
my
and
companions
my
mother
had
several
fine
children
after
she
came
to
williams
three
girls
and
two
boys
the
tasks
given
out
to
us
children
were
light
and
we
used
to
play
together
with
miss
betsey
with
as
much
freedom
almost
as
if
she
had
been
our
sister
my
master
however
was
a
very
harsh
selfish
man
and
we
always
dreaded
his
return
from
sea
his
wife
was
herself
much
afraid
of
him
and
during
his
stay
at
home
seldom
dared
to
shew
her
usual
kindness
to
the
slaves
he
often
left
her
in
the
most
distressed
circumstances
to
reside
in
other
female
society
at
some
place
in
the
west
indies
of
which
i
have
forgot
the
name
my
poor
mistress
bore
his
with
great
patience
and
all
her
slaves
loved
and
pitied
her
i
was
truly
attached
to
her
and
next
to
my
own
mother
loved
her
better
than
any
creature
in
the
world
my
obedience
to
her
commands
was
cheerfully
given
it
sprung
solely
from
the
affection
i
felt
for
her
and
not
from
fear
of
the
power
which
the
white
people
law
had
given
her
over
me
i
had
scarcely
reached
my
twelfth
year
when
my
mistress
became
too
poor
to
keep
so
many
of
us
at
home
and
she
hired
me
out
to
pruden
a
lady
who
lived
about
five
miles
off
in
the
adjoining
parish
in
a
large
house
near
the
sea
i
cried
bitterly
at
parting
with
my
dear
mistress
and
miss
betsey
and
when
i
kissed
my
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
i
thought
my
young
heart
would
break
it
pained
me
so
but
there
was
no
help
i
was
forced
to
go
good
williams
comforted
me
by
saying
that
i
should
still
be
near
the
home
i
was
about
to
quit
and
might
come
over
and
see
her
and
my
kindred
whenever
i
could
obtain
leave
of
absence
from
pruden
a
few
hours
after
this
i
was
taken
to
a
strange
house
and
found
myself
among
strange
people
this
separation
seemed
a
sore
trial
to
me
then
but
oh
was
light
light
to
the
trials
i
have
since
endured
was
nothing
nothing
to
be
mentioned
with
them
but
i
was
a
child
then
and
it
was
according
to
my
strength
i
knew
that
williams
could
no
longer
maintain
me
that
she
was
fain
to
part
with
me
for
my
food
and
clothing
and
i
tried
to
submit
myself
to
the
change
my
new
mistress
was
a
passionate
woman
but
yet
she
did
not
treat
me
very
unkindly
i
do
not
remember
her
striking
me
but
once
and
that
was
for
going
to
see
williams
when
i
heard
she
was
sick
and
staying
longer
than
she
had
given
me
leave
to
do
all
my
employment
at
this
time
was
nursing
a
sweet
baby
little
master
daniel
and
i
grew
so
fond
of
my
nursling
that
it
was
my
greatest
delight
to
walk
out
with
him
by
the
accompanied
by
his
brother
and
sister
miss
fanny
and
master
dear
miss
fanny
she
was
a
sweet
kind
young
lady
and
so
fond
of
me
that
she
wished
me
to
learn
all
that
she
knew
herself
and
her
method
of
teaching
me
was
as
follows
directly
she
had
said
her
lessons
to
her
grandmamma
she
used
to
come
running
to
me
and
make
me
repeat
them
one
by
one
after
her
and
in
a
few
months
i
was
able
not
only
to
say
my
letters
but
to
spell
many
small
words
but
this
happy
state
was
not
to
last
long
those
days
were
too
pleasant
to
last
my
heart
always
softens
when
i
think
of
them
at
this
time
williams
died
i
was
told
suddenly
of
her
death
and
my
grief
was
so
great
that
forgetting
i
had
the
baby
in
my
arms
i
ran
away
directly
to
my
poor
mistress
house
but
reached
it
only
in
time
to
see
the
corpse
carried
out
oh
that
was
a
day
of
sorrow
a
heavy
day
all
the
slaves
cried
my
mother
cried
and
lamented
her
sore
and
i
foolish
creature
vainly
entreated
them
to
bring
my
dear
mistress
back
to
life
i
knew
nothing
rightly
about
death
then
and
it
seemed
a
hard
thing
to
bear
when
i
thought
about
my
mistress
i
felt
as
if
the
world
was
all
gone
wrong
and
for
many
days
and
weeks
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
i
returned
to
pruden
but
my
sorrow
was
too
great
to
be
comforted
for
my
own
dear
mistress
was
always
in
my
mind
whether
in
the
house
or
abroad
my
thoughts
were
always
talking
to
me
about
her
i
staid
at
pruden
about
three
months
after
this
i
was
then
sent
back
to
williams
to
be
sold
oh
that
was
a
sad
sad
time
i
recollect
the
day
well
pruden
came
to
me
and
said
mary
you
will
have
to
go
home
directly
your
master
is
going
to
be
married
and
he
means
to
sell
you
and
two
of
your
sisters
to
raise
money
for
the
wedding
hearing
this
i
burst
out
a
crying
though
i
was
then
far
from
being
sensible
of
the
full
weight
of
my
misfortune
or
of
the
misery
that
waited
for
me
besides
i
did
not
like
to
leave
pruden
and
the
dear
baby
who
had
grown
very
fond
of
me
for
some
time
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
pruden
was
in
earnest
till
i
received
orders
for
my
immediate
dear
miss
fanny
how
she
cried
at
parting
with
me
whilst
i
kissed
and
hugged
the
baby
thinking
i
should
never
see
him
again
i
left
pruden
and
walked
home
with
a
heart
full
of
sorrow
the
idea
of
being
sold
away
from
my
mother
and
miss
betsey
was
so
frightful
that
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
think
about
it
we
had
been
bought
of
myners
as
i
have
mentioned
by
miss
betsey
grandfather
and
given
to
her
so
that
we
were
by
right
property
and
i
never
thought
we
should
be
separated
or
sold
away
from
her
when
i
reached
the
house
i
went
in
directly
to
miss
betsey
i
found
her
in
great
distress
and
she
cried
out
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
oh
mary
my
father
is
going
to
sell
you
all
to
raise
money
to
marry
that
wicked
woman
you
are
slaves
and
he
has
no
right
to
sell
you
but
it
is
all
to
please
her
she
then
told
me
that
my
mother
was
living
with
her
sister
at
a
house
close
by
and
i
went
there
to
see
her
it
was
a
sorrowful
meeting
and
we
lamented
with
a
great
and
sore
crying
our
unfortunate
situation
here
comes
one
of
my
poor
picaninnies
she
said
the
moment
i
came
in
one
of
the
poor
who
are
to
be
sold
oh
dear
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
that
day
it
is
too
it
recalls
the
great
grief
that
filled
my
heart
and
the
woeful
thoughts
that
passed
to
and
fro
through
my
mind
whilst
listening
to
the
pitiful
words
of
my
poor
mother
weeping
for
the
loss
of
her
children
i
wish
i
could
find
words
to
tell
you
all
i
then
felt
and
suffered
the
great
god
above
alone
knows
the
thoughts
of
the
poor
slave
heart
and
the
bitter
pains
which
follow
such
separations
as
these
all
that
we
love
taken
away
from
us
oh
it
is
sad
sad
and
sore
to
be
borne
i
got
no
sleep
that
night
for
thinking
of
the
morrow
and
dear
miss
betsey
was
scarcely
less
distressed
she
could
not
bear
to
part
with
her
old
playmates
and
she
cried
sore
and
would
not
be
pacified
the
black
morning
at
length
came
it
came
too
soon
for
my
poor
mother
and
us
whilst
she
was
putting
on
us
the
new
osnaburgs
in
which
we
were
to
be
sold
she
said
in
a
sorrowful
voice
i
shall
never
forget
it
see
i
am
my
poor
children
what
a
task
for
a
mother
she
then
called
miss
betsey
to
take
leave
of
us
i
am
going
to
carry
my
little
chickens
to
market
these
were
her
very
words
take
your
last
look
of
them
may
be
you
will
see
them
no
more
oh
my
poor
slaves
my
own
slaves
said
dear
miss
betsey
you
belong
to
me
and
it
grieves
my
heart
to
part
with
you
miss
betsey
kissed
us
all
and
when
she
left
us
my
mother
called
the
rest
of
the
slaves
to
bid
us
good
bye
one
of
them
a
woman
named
moll
came
with
her
infant
in
her
arms
ay
said
my
mother
seeing
her
turn
away
and
look
at
her
child
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
your
turn
will
come
next
the
slaves
could
say
nothing
to
comfort
us
they
could
only
weep
and
lament
with
us
when
i
left
my
dear
little
brothers
and
the
house
in
which
i
had
been
brought
up
i
thought
my
heart
would
burst
our
mother
weeping
as
she
went
called
me
away
with
the
children
hannah
and
dinah
and
we
took
the
road
that
led
to
hamble
town
which
we
reached
about
four
in
the
afternoon
we
followed
my
mother
to
the
where
she
placed
us
in
a
row
against
a
large
house
with
our
backs
to
the
wall
and
our
arms
folded
across
our
breasts
i
as
the
eldest
stood
first
hannah
next
to
me
then
dinah
and
our
mother
stood
beside
crying
over
us
my
heart
throbbed
with
grief
and
terror
so
violently
that
i
pressed
my
hands
quite
tightly
across
my
breast
but
i
could
not
keep
it
still
and
it
continued
to
leap
as
though
it
would
burst
out
of
my
body
but
who
cared
for
that
did
one
of
the
many
who
were
looking
at
us
so
carelessly
think
of
the
pain
that
wrung
the
hearts
of
the
negro
woman
and
her
young
ones
no
no
they
were
not
all
bad
i
dare
say
but
slavery
hardens
white
people
hearts
towards
the
blacks
and
many
of
them
were
not
slow
to
make
their
remarks
upon
us
aloud
without
regard
to
our
grief
though
their
light
words
fell
like
cayenne
on
the
fresh
wounds
of
our
hearts
oh
those
white
people
have
small
hearts
who
can
only
feel
for
themselves
at
length
the
vendue
master
who
was
to
offer
us
for
sale
like
sheep
or
cattle
arrived
and
asked
my
mother
which
was
the
eldest
she
said
nothing
but
pointed
to
me
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
and
turning
me
slowly
round
exposed
me
to
the
view
of
those
who
attended
the
vendue
i
was
soon
surrounded
by
strange
men
who
examined
and
handled
me
in
the
same
manner
that
a
butcher
would
a
calf
or
a
lamb
he
was
about
to
purchase
and
who
talked
about
my
shape
and
size
in
like
words
as
if
i
could
no
more
understand
their
meaning
than
the
dumb
beasts
i
was
then
put
up
to
sale
the
bidding
commenced
at
a
few
pounds
and
gradually
rose
to
when
i
was
knocked
down
to
the
highest
bidder
and
the
people
who
stood
by
said
that
i
had
fetched
a
great
sum
for
so
young
a
slave
footnote
bermuda
currency
about
sterling
i
then
saw
my
sisters
led
forth
and
sold
to
different
owners
so
that
we
had
not
the
sad
satisfaction
of
being
partners
in
bondage
when
the
sale
was
over
my
mother
hugged
and
kissed
us
and
mourned
over
us
begging
of
us
to
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
do
our
duty
to
our
new
masters
it
was
a
sad
parting
one
went
one
way
one
another
and
our
poor
mammy
went
home
with
nothing
footnote
let
the
reader
compare
the
above
affecting
account
taken
down
from
the
mouth
of
this
negro
woman
with
the
following
description
of
a
vendue
of
slaves
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
published
by
me
in
from
the
letter
of
a
friend
and
mark
their
similarity
in
several
characteristic
circumstances
the
resemblance
is
easily
accounted
for
slavery
wherever
it
prevails
produces
similar
having
heard
that
there
was
to
be
a
sale
of
cattle
farm
stock
by
auction
at
a
in
the
vicinity
we
halted
our
waggon
one
day
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
a
fresh
spann
of
oxen
among
the
stock
of
the
farm
sold
was
a
female
slave
and
her
three
children
the
two
eldest
children
were
girls
the
one
about
thirteen
years
of
age
and
the
other
about
eleven
the
youngest
was
a
boy
the
whole
family
were
exhibited
together
but
they
were
sold
separately
and
to
different
purchasers
the
farmers
examined
them
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
head
of
cattle
while
the
sale
was
going
on
the
mother
and
her
children
were
exhibited
on
a
table
that
they
might
be
seen
by
the
company
which
was
very
large
there
could
not
have
been
a
finer
subject
for
an
able
painter
than
this
unhappy
group
the
tears
the
anxiety
the
anguish
of
the
mother
while
she
met
the
gaze
of
the
multitude
eyed
the
different
countenances
of
the
bidders
or
cast
a
look
upon
the
children
and
the
simplicity
and
touching
sorrow
of
the
young
ones
while
they
clung
to
their
distracted
parent
wiping
their
eyes
and
half
concealing
their
faces
contrasted
with
the
marked
insensibility
and
jocular
countenances
of
the
spectators
and
purchasers
furnished
a
striking
commentary
on
the
miseries
of
slavery
and
its
debasing
effects
upon
the
hearts
of
its
abettors
while
the
woman
was
in
this
distressed
situation
she
was
asked
you
feed
sheep
her
reply
was
so
indistinct
that
it
escaped
me
but
it
was
probably
in
the
negative
for
her
purchaser
rejoined
in
a
loud
and
harsh
voice
i
will
teach
you
with
the
sjamboc
a
whip
made
of
the
rhinoceros
hide
the
mother
and
her
three
children
were
sold
to
three
separate
purchasers
and
they
were
literally
torn
from
each
other
my
new
master
was
a
captain
i
who
lived
at
spanish
point
after
parting
with
my
mother
and
sisters
i
followed
him
to
his
store
and
he
gave
me
into
the
charge
of
his
son
a
lad
about
my
own
age
master
benjy
who
took
me
to
my
new
home
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
going
or
what
my
new
master
would
do
with
me
my
heart
was
quite
broken
with
grief
and
my
thoughts
went
back
continually
to
those
from
whom
i
had
been
so
suddenly
parted
oh
my
mother
my
mother
i
kept
saying
to
myself
oh
my
mammy
and
my
sisters
and
my
brothers
shall
i
never
see
you
again
oh
the
trials
the
trials
they
make
the
salt
water
come
into
my
eyes
when
i
think
of
the
days
in
which
i
was
afflicted
the
times
that
are
gone
when
i
mourned
and
grieved
with
a
young
heart
for
those
whom
i
loved
it
was
night
when
i
reached
my
new
home
the
house
was
large
and
built
at
the
bottom
of
a
very
high
hill
but
i
could
not
see
much
of
it
that
night
i
saw
too
much
of
it
afterwards
the
stones
and
the
timber
were
the
best
things
in
it
they
were
not
so
hard
as
the
hearts
of
the
owners
footnote
these
strong
expressions
and
all
of
a
similar
character
in
this
little
narrative
are
given
verbatim
as
uttered
by
mary
before
i
entered
the
house
two
slave
women
hired
from
another
owner
who
were
at
work
in
the
yard
spoke
to
me
and
asked
who
i
belonged
to
i
replied
i
am
come
to
live
here
poor
child
poor
child
they
both
said
you
must
keep
a
good
heart
if
you
are
to
live
here
when
i
went
in
i
stood
up
crying
in
a
corner
mrs
i
came
and
took
off
my
hat
a
little
black
silk
hat
miss
pruden
made
for
me
and
said
in
a
rough
voice
you
are
not
come
here
to
stand
up
in
corners
and
cry
you
are
come
here
to
work
she
then
put
a
child
into
my
arms
and
tired
as
i
was
i
was
forced
instantly
to
take
up
my
old
occupation
of
a
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
my
mistress
her
countenance
was
so
stern
she
was
a
stout
tall
woman
with
a
very
dark
complexion
and
her
brows
were
always
drawn
together
into
a
frown
i
thought
of
the
words
of
the
two
slave
women
when
i
saw
mrs
i
and
heard
the
harsh
sound
of
her
voice
the
person
i
took
the
most
notice
of
that
night
was
a
french
black
called
hetty
whom
my
master
took
in
privateering
from
another
vessel
and
made
his
slave
she
was
the
most
active
woman
i
ever
saw
and
she
was
tasked
to
her
utmost
a
few
minutes
after
my
arrival
she
came
in
from
milking
the
cows
and
put
the
on
for
supper
she
then
fetched
home
the
sheep
and
penned
them
in
the
fold
drove
home
the
cattle
and
staked
them
about
the
pond
side
fed
and
rubbed
down
my
master
horse
and
gave
the
hog
and
the
fed
cow
their
suppers
prepared
the
beds
and
undressed
the
children
and
laid
them
to
sleep
i
liked
to
look
at
her
and
watch
all
her
doings
for
hers
was
the
only
friendly
face
i
had
as
yet
seen
and
i
felt
glad
that
she
was
there
she
gave
me
my
supper
of
potatoes
and
milk
and
a
blanket
to
sleep
upon
which
she
spread
for
me
in
the
passage
before
the
door
of

a
cow
fed
for
slaughter
i
got
a
sad
fright
that
night
i
was
just
going
to
sleep
when
i
heard
a
noise
in
my
mistress
room
and
she
presently
called
out
to
inquire
if
some
work
was
finished
that
she
had
ordered
hetty
to
do
no
not
yet
was
hetty
answer
from
below
on
hearing
this
my
master
started
up
from
his
bed
and
just
as
he
was
in
his
shirt
ran
down
stairs
with
a
long
in
his
hand
i
heard
immediately
after
the
cracking
of
the
thong
and
the
house
rang
to
the
shrieks
of
poor
hetty
who
kept
crying
out
oh
massa
massa
me
dead
massa
have
mercy
upon
me
kill
me
outright
this
was
a
sad
beginning
for
me
i
sat
up
upon
my
blanket
trembling
with
terror
like
a
frightened
hound
and
thinking
that
my
turn
would
come
next
at
length
the
house
became
still
and
i
forgot
for
a
little
while
all
my
sorrows
by
falling
fast
asleep
footnote
a
thong
of
hard
twisted
hide
known
by
this
name
in
the
west
indies
the
next
morning
my
mistress
set
about
instructing
me
in
my
tasks
she
taught
me
to
do
all
sorts
of
household
work
to
wash
and
bake
pick
cotton
and
wool
and
wash
floors
and
cook
and
she
taught
me
how
can
i
ever
forget
it
more
things
than
these
she
caused
me
to
know
the
exact
difference
between
the
smart
of
the
rope
the
and
the
when
applied
to
my
naked
body
by
her
own
cruel
hand
and
there
was
scarcely
any
punishment
more
dreadful
than
the
blows
i
received
on
my
face
and
head
from
her
hard
heavy
fist
she
was
a
fearful
woman
and
a
savage
mistress
to
her
slaves
there
were
two
little
slave
boys
in
the
house
on
whom
she
vented
her
bad
temper
in
a
special
manner
one
of
these
children
was
a
mulatto
called
cyrus
who
had
been
bought
while
an
infant
in
his
mother
arms
the
other
jack
was
an
african
from
the
coast
of
guinea
whom
a
sailor
had
given
or
sold
to
my
master
seldom
a
day
passed
without
these
boys
receiving
the
most
severe
treatment
and
often
for
no
fault
at
all
both
my
master
and
mistress
seemed
to
think
that
they
had
a
right
to
them
at
their
pleasure
and
very
often
accompanied
their
commands
with
blows
whether
the
children
were
behaving
well
or
ill
i
have
seen
their
flesh
ragged
and
raw
with
lick
lick
they
were
never
secure
one
moment
from
a
blow
and
their
lives
were
passed
in
continual
fear
my
mistress
was
not
contented
with
using
the
whip
but
often
pinched
their
cheeks
and
arms
in
the
most
cruel
manner
my
pity
for
these
poor
boys
was
soon
transferred
to
myself
for
i
was
licked
and
flogged
and
pinched
by
her
pitiless
fingers
in
the
neck
and
arms
exactly
as
they
were
to
strip
me
naked
to
hang
me
up
by
the
wrists
and
lay
my
flesh
open
with
the
was
an
ordinary
punishment
for
even
a
slight
offence
my
mistress
often
robbed
me
too
of
the
hours
that
belong
to
sleep
she
used
to
sit
up
very
late
frequently
even
until
morning
and
i
had
then
to
stand
at
a
bench
and
wash
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
or
pick
wool
and
cotton
and
often
i
have
dropped
down
overcome
by
sleep
and
fatigue
till
roused
from
a
state
of
stupor
by
the
whip
and
forced
to
start
up
to
my
tasks
poor
hetty
my
fellow
slave
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
used
to
call
her
my
aunt
but
she
led
a
most
miserable
life
and
her
death
was
hastened
at
least
the
slaves
all
believed
and
said
so
by
the
dreadful
chastisement
she
received
from
my
master
during
her
pregnancy
it
happened
as
follows
one
of
the
cows
had
dragged
the
rope
away
from
the
stake
to
which
hetty
had
fastened
it
and
got
loose
my
master
flew
into
a
terrible
passion
and
ordered
the
poor
creature
to
be
stripped
quite
naked
notwithstanding
her
pregnancy
and
to
be
tied
up
to
a
tree
in
the
yard
he
then
flogged
her
as
hard
as
he
could
lick
both
with
the
whip
and
till
she
was
all
over
streaming
with
blood
he
rested
and
then
beat
her
again
and
again
her
shrieks
were
terrible
the
consequence
was
that
poor
hetty
was
brought
to
bed
before
her
time
and
was
delivered
after
severe
labour
of
a
dead
child
she
appeared
to
recover
after
her
confinement
so
far
that
she
was
repeatedly
flogged
by
both
master
and
mistress
afterwards
but
her
former
strength
never
returned
to
her
ere
long
her
body
and
limbs
swelled
to
a
great
size
and
she
lay
on
a
mat
in
the
kitchen
till
the
water
burst
out
of
her
body
and
she
died
all
the
slaves
said
that
death
was
a
good
thing
for
poor
hetty
but
i
cried
very
much
for
her
death
the
manner
of
it
filled
me
with
horror
i
could
not
bear
to
think
about
it
yet
it
was
always
present
to
my
mind
for
many
a
day
after
hetty
died
all
her
labours
fell
upon
me
in
addition
to
my
own
i
had
now
to
milk
eleven
cows
every
morning
before
sunrise
sitting
among
the
damp
weeds
to
take
care
of
the
cattle
as
well
as
the
children
and
to
do
the
work
of
the
house
there
was
no
end
to
my
toils
no
end
to
my
blows
i
lay
down
at
night
and
rose
up
in
the
morning
in
fear
and
sorrow
and
often
wished
that
like
poor
hetty
i
could
escape
from
this
cruel
bondage
and
be
at
rest
in
the
grave
but
the
hand
of
that
god
whom
then
i
knew
not
was
stretched
over
me
and
i
was
mercifully
preserved
for
better
things
it
was
then
however
my
heavy
lot
to
weep
weep
weep
and
that
for
years
to
pass
from
one
misery
to
another
and
from
one
cruel
master
to
a
worse
but
i
must
go
on
with
the
thread
of
my
story
one
day
a
heavy
squall
of
wind
and
rain
came
on
suddenly
and
my
mistress
sent
me
round
the
corner
of
the
house
to
empty
a
large
earthen
jar
the
jar
was
already
cracked
with
an
old
deep
crack
that
divided
it
in
the
middle
and
in
turning
it
upside
down
to
empty
it
it
parted
in
my
hand
i
could
not
help
the
accident
but
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
looking
forward
to
a
severe
punishment
i
ran
crying
to
my
mistress
o
mistress
the
jar
has
come
in
two
you
have
broken
it
have
you
she
replied
come
directly
here
to
me
i
came
trembling
she
stripped
and
flogged
me
long
and
severely
with
the
as
long
as
she
had
strength
to
use
the
lash
for
she
did
not
give
over
till
she
was
quite
when
my
master
came
home
at
night
she
told
him
of
my
fault
and
oh
frightful
how
he
fell
a
swearing
after
abusing
me
with
every
ill
name
he
could
think
of
too
too
bad
to
speak
in
england
and
giving
me
several
heavy
blows
with
his
hand
he
said
i
shall
come
home
morning
at
twelve
on
purpose
to
give
you
a
round
hundred
he
kept
his
word
oh
sad
for
me
i
can
not
easily
forget
it
he
tied
me
up
upon
a
ladder
and
gave
me
a
hundred
lashes
with
his
own
hand
and
master
benjy
stood
by
to
count
them
for
him
when
he
had
licked
me
for
some
time
he
sat
down
to
take
breath
then
after
resting
he
beat
me
again
and
again
until
he
was
quite
wearied
and
so
hot
for
the
weather
was
very
sultry
that
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
almost
like
to
faint
while
my
mistress
went
to
bring
him
drink
there
was
a
dreadful
earthquake
part
of
the
roof
fell
down
and
every
thing
in
the
house
went
clatter
clatter
clatter
oh
i
thought
the
end
of
all
things
near
at
hand
and
i
was
so
sore
with
the
flogging
that
i
scarcely
cared
whether
i
lived
or
died
the
earth
was
groaning
and
shaking
every
thing
tumbling
about
and
my
mistress
and
the
slaves
were
shrieking
and
crying
out
the
earthquake
the
earthquake
it
was
an
awful
day
for
us
all
during
the
confusion
i
crawled
away
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
laid
myself
down
under
the
steps
of
the
piazza
in
front
of
the
house
i
was
in
a
dreadful
state
my
body
all
blood
and
bruises
and
i
could
not
help
moaning
piteously
the
other
slaves
when
they
saw
me
shook
their
heads
and
said
poor
child
poor
child
i
lay
there
till
the
morning
careless
of
what
might
happen
for
life
was
very
weak
in
me
and
i
wished
more
than
ever
to
die
but
when
we
are
very
young
death
always
seems
a
great
way
off
and
it
would
not
come
that
night
to
me
the
next
morning
i
was
forced
by
my
master
to
rise
and
go
about
my
usual
work
though
my
body
and
limbs
were
so
stiff
and
sore
that
i
could
not
move
without
the
greatest
nevertheless
even
after
all
this
severe
punishment
i
never
heard
the
last
of
that
jar
my
mistress
was
always
throwing
it
in
my
face
some
little
time
after
this
one
of
the
cows
got
loose
from
the
stake
and
eat
one
of
the
slips
i
was
milking
when
my
master
found
it
out
he
came
to
me
and
without
any
more
ado
stooped
down
and
taking
off
his
heavy
boot
he
struck
me
such
a
severe
blow
in
the
small
of
my
back
that
i
shrieked
with
agony
and
thought
i
was
killed
and
i
feel
a
weakness
in
that
part
to
this
day
the
cow
was
frightened
at
his
violence
and
kicked
down
the
pail
and
spilt
the
milk
all
about
my
master
knew
that
this
accident
was
his
own
fault
but
he
was
so
enraged
that
he
seemed
glad
of
an
excuse
to
go
on
with
his
ill
usage
i
can
not
remember
how
many
licks
he
gave
me
then
but
he
beat
me
till
i
was
unable
to
stand
and
till
he
himself
was
weary
after
this
i
ran
away
and
went
to
my
mother
who
was
living
with
richard
darrel
my
poor
mother
was
both
grieved
and
glad
to
see
me
grieved
because
i
had
been
so
ill
used
and
glad
because
she
had
not
seen
me
for
a
long
long
while
she
dared
not
receive
me
into
the
house
but
she
hid
me
up
in
a
hole
in
the
rocks
near
and
brought
me
food
at
night
after
every
body
was
asleep
my
father
who
lived
at
over
the
channel
at
last
heard
of
my
being
hid
up
in
the
cavern
and
he
came
and
took
me
back
to
my
master
oh
i
was
loth
loth
to
go
back
but
as
there
was
no
remedy
i
was
obliged
to
submit
when
we
got
home
my
poor
father
said
to
capt
i
sir
i
am
sorry
that
my
child
should
be
forced
to
run
away
from
her
owner
but
the
treatment
she
has
received
is
enough
to
break
her
heart
the
sight
of
her
wounds
has
nearly
broke
i
entreat
you
for
the
love
of
god
to
forgive
her
for
running
away
and
that
you
will
be
a
kind
master
to
her
in
future
capt
i
said
i
was
used
as
well
as
i
deserved
and
that
i
ought
to
be
punished
for
running
away
i
then
took
courage
and
said
that
i
could
stand
the
floggings
no
longer
that
i
was
weary
of
my
life
and
therefore
i
had
run
away
to
my
mother
but
mothers
could
only
weep
and
mourn
over
their
children
they
could
not
save
them
from
cruel
masters
from
the
whip
the
rope
and
the
he
told
me
to
hold
my
tongue
and
go
about
my
work
or
he
would
find
a
way
to
settle
me
he
did
not
however
flog
me
that
day
for
five
years
after
this
i
remained
in
his
house
and
almost
daily
received
the
same
harsh
treatment
at
length
he
put
me
on
board
a
sloop
and
to
my
great
joy
sent
me
away
to
turk
island
i
was
not
permitted
to
see
my
mother
or
father
or
poor
sisters
and
brothers
to
say
good
bye
though
going
away
to
a
strange
land
and
might
never
see
them
again
oh
the
buckra
people
who
keep
slaves
think
that
black
people
are
like
cattle
without
natural
affection
but
my
heart
tells
me
it
is
far
otherwise
we
were
nearly
four
weeks
on
the
voyage
which
was
unusually
long
sometimes
we
had
a
light
breeze
sometimes
a
great
calm
and
the
ship
made
no
way
so
that
our
provisions
and
water
ran
very
low
and
we
were
put
upon
short
allowance
i
should
almost
have
been
starved
had
it
not
been
for
the
kindness
of
a
black
man
called
anthony
and
his
wife
who
had
brought
their
own
victuals
and
shared
them
with
me
when
we
went
ashore
at
the
grand
quay
the
captain
sent
me
to
the
house
of
my
new
master
d
to
whom
captain
i
had
sold
me
grand
quay
is
a
small
town
upon
a
sandbank
the
houses
low
and
built
of
wood
such
was
my
new
master
the
first
person
i
saw
on
my
arrival
was
d
a
stout
sulky
looking
man
who
carried
me
through
the
hall
to
show
me
to
his
wife
and
children
next
day
i
was
put
up
by
the
vendue
master
to
know
how
much
i
was
worth
and
i
was
valued
at
one
hundred
pounds
currency
my
new
master
was
one
of
the
owners
or
holders
of
the
salt
ponds
and
he
received
a
certain
sum
for
every
slave
that
worked
upon
his
premises
whether
they
were
young
or
old
this
sum
was
allowed
him
out
of
the
profits
arising
from
the
salt
works
i
was
immediately
sent
to
work
in
the
salt
water
with
the
rest
of
the
slaves
this
work
was
perfectly
new
to
me
i
was
given
a
half
barrel
and
a
shovel
and
had
to
stand
up
to
my
knees
in
the
water
from
four
in
the
morning
till
nine
when
we
were
given
some
indian
corn
boiled
in
water
which
we
were
obliged
to
swallow
as
fast
as
we
could
for
fear
the
rain
should
come
on
and
melt
the
salt
we
were
then
called
again
to
our
tasks
and
worked
through
the
heat
of
the
day
the
sun
flaming
upon
our
heads
like
fire
and
raising
salt
blisters
in
those
parts
which
were
not
completely
covered
our
feet
and
legs
from
standing
in
the
salt
water
for
so
many
hours
soon
became
full
of
dreadful
boils
which
eat
down
in
some
cases
to
the
very
bone
afflicting
the
sufferers
with
great
torment
we
came
home
at
twelve
ate
our
corn
soup
called
as
fast
as
we
could
and
went
back
to
our
employment
till
dark
at
night
we
then
shovelled
up
the
salt
in
large
heaps
and
went
down
to
the
sea
where
we
washed
the
pickle
from
our
limbs
and
cleaned
the
barrows
and
shovels
from
the
salt
when
we
returned
to
the
house
our
master
gave
us
each
our
allowance
of
raw
indian
corn
which
we
pounded
in
a
mortar
and
boiled
in
water
for
our
suppers
we
slept
in
a
long
shed
divided
into
narrow
slips
like
the
stalls
used
for
cattle
boards
fixed
upon
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
without
mat
or
covering
were
our
only
beds
on
sundays
after
we
had
washed
the
salt
bags
and
done
other
work
required
of
us
we
went
into
the
bush
and
cut
the
long
soft
grass
of
which
we
made
trusses
for
our
legs
and
feet
to
rest
upon
for
they
were
so
full
of
the
salt
boils
that
we
could
get
no
rest
lying
upon
the
bare
boards
though
we
worked
from
morning
till
night
there
was
no
satisfying
d
i
hoped
when
i
left
capt
i
that
i
should
have
been
better
off
but
i
found
it
was
but
going
from
one
butcher
to
another
there
was
this
difference
between
them
my
former
master
used
to
beat
me
while
raging
and
foaming
with
passion
d
was
usually
quite
calm
he
would
stand
by
and
give
orders
for
a
slave
to
be
cruelly
whipped
and
assist
in
the
punishment
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
walking
about
and
taking
snuff
with
the
greatest
composure
nothing
could
touch
his
hard
heart
neither
sighs
nor
tears
nor
prayers
nor
streaming
blood
he
was
deaf
to
our
cries
and
careless
of
our
sufferings
d
has
often
stripped
me
naked
hung
me
up
by
the
wrists
and
beat
me
with
the
with
his
own
hand
till
my
body
was
raw
with
gashes
yet
there
was
nothing
very
remarkable
in
this
for
it
might
serve
as
a
sample
of
the
common
usage
of
the
slaves
on
that
horrible
island
owing
to
the
boils
in
my
feet
i
was
unable
to
wheel
the
barrow
fast
through
the
sand
which
got
into
the
sores
and
made
me
stumble
at
every
step
and
my
master
having
no
pity
for
my
sufferings
from
this
cause
rendered
them
far
more
intolerable
by
chastising
me
for
not
being
able
to
move
so
fast
as
he
wished
me
another
of
our
employments
was
to
row
a
little
way
off
from
the
shore
in
a
boat
and
dive
for
large
stones
to
build
a
wall
round
our
master
house
this
was
very
hard
work
and
the
great
waves
breaking
over
us
continually
made
us
often
so
giddy
that
we
lost
our
footing
and
were
in
danger
of
being
drowned
ah
poor
me
my
tasks
were
never
ended
sick
or
well
it
was
work
work
work
after
the
diving
season
was
over
we
were
sent
to
the
south
creek
with
large
bills
to
cut
up
mangoes
to
burn
lime
with
whilst
one
party
of
slaves
were
thus
employed
another
were
sent
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
to
break
up
coral
out
of
the
sea
when
we
were
ill
let
our
complaint
be
what
it
might
the
only
medicine
given
to
us
was
a
great
bowl
of
hot
salt
water
with
salt
mixed
with
it
which
made
us
very
sick
if
we
could
not
keep
up
with
the
rest
of
the
gang
of
slaves
we
were
put
in
the
stocks
and
severely
flogged
the
next
morning
yet
not
the
less
our
master
expected
after
we
had
thus
been
kept
from
our
rest
and
our
limbs
rendered
stiff
and
sore
with
ill
usage
that
we
should
still
go
through
the
ordinary
tasks
of
the
day
all
the
sometimes
we
had
to
work
all
night
measuring
salt
to
load
a
vessel
or
turning
a
machine
to
draw
water
out
of
the
sea
for
the
then
we
had
no
sleep
no
rest
but
were
forced
to
work
as
fast
as
we
could
and
go
on
again
all
next
day
the
same
as
usual
work
work
work
oh
that
turk
island
was
a
horrible
place
the
people
in
england
i
am
sure
have
never
found
out
what
is
carried
on
there
cruel
horrible
place
d
had
a
slave
called
old
daniel
whom
he
used
to
treat
in
the
most
cruel
manner
poor
daniel
was
lame
in
the
hip
and
could
not
keep
up
with
the
rest
of
the
slaves
and
our
master
would
order
him
to
be
stripped
and
laid
down
on
the
ground
and
have
him
beaten
with
a
rod
of
rough
briar
till
his
skin
was
quite
red
and
raw
he
would
then
call
for
a
bucket
of
salt
and
fling
upon
the
raw
flesh
till
the
man
writhed
on
the
ground
like
a
worm
and
screamed
aloud
with
agony
this
poor
man
wounds
were
never
healed
and
i
have
often
seen
them
full
of
maggots
which
increased
his
torments
to
an
intolerable
degree
he
was
an
object
of
pity
and
terror
to
the
whole
gang
of
slaves
and
in
his
wretched
case
we
saw
each
of
us
our
own
lot
if
we
should
live
to
be
as
old
oh
the
horrors
of
slavery
how
the
thought
of
it
pains
my
heart
but
the
truth
ought
to
be
told
of
it
and
what
my
eyes
have
seen
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
relate
for
few
people
in
england
know
what
slavery
is
i
have
been
a
slave
i
have
felt
what
a
slave
feels
and
i
know
what
a
slave
knows
and
i
would
have
all
the
good
people
in
england
to
know
it
too
that
they
may
break
our
chains
and
set
us
free
d
had
another
slave
called
ben
he
being
very
hungry
stole
a
little
rice
one
night
after
he
came
in
from
work
and
cooked
it
for
his
supper
but
his
master
soon
discovered
the
theft
locked
him
up
all
night
and
kept
him
without
food
till
one
the
next
day
he
then
hung
ben
up
by
his
hands
and
beat
him
from
time
to
time
till
the
slaves
came
in
at
night
we
found
the
poor
creature
hung
up
when
we
came
home
with
a
pool
of
blood
beneath
him
and
our
master
still
licking
him
but
this
was
not
the
worst
my
master
son
was
in
the
habit
of
stealing
the
rice
and
rum
ben
had
seen
him
do
this
and
thought
he
might
do
the
same
and
when
master
found
out
that
ben
had
stolen
the
rice
and
swore
to
punish
him
he
tried
to
excuse
himself
by
saying
that
master
dickey
did
the
same
thing
every
night
the
lad
denied
it
to
his
father
and
was
so
angry
with
ben
for
informing
against
him
that
out
of
revenge
he
ran
and
got
a
bayonet
and
whilst
the
poor
wretch
was
suspended
by
his
hands
and
writhing
under
his
wounds
he
run
it
quite
through
his
foot
i
was
not
by
when
he
did
it
but
i
saw
the
wound
when
i
came
home
and
heard
ben
tell
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
i
must
say
something
more
about
this
cruel
son
of
a
cruel
he
had
no
heart
no
fear
of
god
he
had
been
brought
up
by
a
bad
father
in
a
bad
path
and
he
delighted
to
follow
in
the
same
steps
there
was
a
little
old
woman
among
the
slaves
called
sarah
who
was
nearly
past
work
and
master
dickey
being
the
overseer
of
the
slaves
just
then
this
poor
creature
who
was
subject
to
several
bodily
infirmities
and
was
not
quite
right
in
her
head
did
not
wheel
the
barrow
fast
enough
to
please
him
he
threw
her
down
on
the
ground
and
after
beating
her
severely
he
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
flung
her
among
the
bushes
which
are
all
covered
over
with
sharp
venomous
prickles
by
this
her
naked
flesh
was
so
grievously
wounded
that
her
body
swelled
and
festered
all
over
and
she
died
a
few
days
after
in
telling
my
own
sorrows
i
can
not
pass
by
those
of
my
for
when
i
think
of
my
own
griefs
i
remember
theirs
i
think
it
was
about
ten
years
i
had
worked
in
the
salt
ponds
at
island
when
my
master
left
off
business
and
retired
to
a
house
he
had
in
bermuda
leaving
his
son
to
succeed
him
in
the
island
he
took
me
with
him
to
wait
upon
his
daughters
and
i
was
joyful
for
i
was
sick
sick
of
turk
island
and
my
heart
yearned
to
see
my
native
place
again
my
mother
and
my
kindred
i
had
seen
my
poor
mother
during
the
time
i
was
a
slave
in
turk
island
one
sunday
morning
i
was
on
the
beach
with
some
of
the
slaves
and
we
saw
a
sloop
come
in
loaded
with
slaves
to
work
in
the
salt
water
we
got
a
boat
and
went
aboard
when
i
came
upon
the
deck
i
asked
the
black
people
is
there
any
one
here
for
me
yes
they
said
your
mother
i
thought
they
said
this
in
jest
i
could
scarcely
believe
them
for
joy
but
when
i
saw
my
poor
mammy
my
joy
was
turned
to
sorrow
for
she
had
gone
from
her
senses
mammy
i
said
is
this
you
she
did
not
know
me
mammy
i
said
what
the
matter
she
began
to
talk
foolishly
and
said
that
she
had
been
under
the
vessel
bottom
they
had
been
overtaken
by
a
violent
storm
at
sea
my
poor
mother
had
never
been
on
the
sea
before
and
she
was
so
ill
that
she
lost
her
senses
and
it
was
long
before
she
came
quite
to
herself
again
she
had
a
sweet
child
with
her
a
little
sister
i
had
never
seen
about
four
years
of
age
called
rebecca
i
took
her
on
shore
with
me
for
i
felt
i
should
love
her
directly
and
i
kept
her
with
me
a
week
poor
little
thing
her
has
been
a
sad
life
and
continues
so
to
this
day
my
mother
worked
for
some
years
on
the
island
but
was
taken
back
to
bermuda
some
time
before
my
master
carried
me
again
thither
footnote
of
the
subsequent
lot

her
relatives

can
tell
but
little
she
says

father
died
while
she
and
her
mother
were
at
island
and
that
he
had
been
long
dead
and
buried
before

than
this
that

eldest
sister

several
children
to

taken
by

after
i
left
turk
island
i
was
told
by
some
negroes
that
came
over
from
it
that
the
poor
slaves
had
built
up
a
place
with
boughs
and
leaves
where
they
might
meet
for
prayers
but
the
white
people
pulled
it
down
twice
and
would
not
allow
them
even
a
shed
for
prayers
a
flood
came
down
soon
after
and
washed
away
many
houses
filled
the
place
with
sand
and
overflowed
the
ponds
and
i
do
think
that
this
was
for
their
wickedness
for
the
buckra
men
there
were
very
wicked
i
saw
and
heard
much
that
was
very
very
bad
at
that
place
footnote
negro
term
for
white
people
i
was
several
years
the
slave
of
d
after
i
returned
to
my
native
place
here
i
worked
in
the
grounds
my
work
was
planting
and
hoeing
indian
corn
plantains
bananas
cabbages
pumpkins
onions
i
did
all
the
household
work
and
attended
upon
a
horse
and
cow
besides
going
also
upon
all
errands
i
had
to
curry
the
horse
to
clean
and
feed
him
and
sometimes
to
ride
him
a
little
i
had
more
than
enough
to
do
but
still
it
was
not
so
very
bad
as
turk
island
my
old
master
often
got
drunk
and
then
he
would
get
in
a
fury
with
his
daughter
and
beat
her
till
she
was
not
fit
to
be
seen
i
remember
on
one
occasion
i
had
gone
to
fetch
water
and
when
i
was
coming
up
the
hill
i
heard
a
great
screaming
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
to
the
house
put
down
the
water
and
went
into
the
chamber
where
i
found
my
master
beating
miss
d
dreadfully
i
strove
with
all
my
strength
to
get
her
away
from
him
for
she
was
all
black
and
blue
with
bruises
he
had
beat
her
with
his
fist
and
almost
killed
her
the
people
gave
me
credit
for
getting
her
away
he
turned
round
and
began
to
lick
me
then
i
said
sir
this
is
not
turk
island
i
ca
repeat
his
answer
the
words
were
too
wicked
too
bad
to
say
he
wanted
to
treat
me
the
same
in
bermuda
as
he
had
done
in
turk
island
he
had
an
ugly
fashion
of
stripping
himself
quite
naked
and
ordering
me
then
to
wash
him
in
a
tub
of
water
this
was
worse
to
me
than
all
the
licks
sometimes
when
he
called
me
to
wash
him
i
would
not
come
my
eyes
were
so
full
of
shame
he
would
then
come
to
beat
me
one
time
i
had
plates
and
knives
in
my
hand
and
i
dropped
both
plates
and
knives
and
some
of
the
plates
were
broken
he
struck
me
so
severely
for
this
that
at
last
i
defended
myself
for
i
thought
it
was
high
time
to
do
so
i
then
told
him
i
would
not
live
longer
with
him
for
he
was
a
very
indecent
man
very
spiteful
and
too
indecent
with
no
shame
for
his
servants
no
shame
for
his
own
flesh
so
i
went
away
to
a
neighbouring
house
and
sat
down
and
cried
till
the
next
morning
when
i
went
home
again
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
after
that
i
was
hired
to
work
at
cedar
hills
and
every
saturday
night
i
paid
the
money
to
my
master
i
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
there
plenty
of
washing
but
yet
i
made
myself
pretty
comfortable
i
earned
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
a
week
which
is
twenty
pence
a
day
during
the
time
i
worked
there
i
heard
that
john
wood
was
going
to
antigua
i
felt
a
great
wish
to
go
there
and
i
went
to
d
and
asked
him
to
let
me
go
in
wood
service
wood
did
not
then
want
to
purchase
me
it
was
my
own
fault
that
i
came
under
him
i
was
so
anxious
to
go
it
was
ordained
to
be
i
suppose
god
led
me
there
the
truth
is
i
did
not
wish
to
be
any
longer
the
slave
of
my
indecent
master
wood
took
me
with
him
to
antigua
to
the
town
of
john
where
he
lived
this
was
about
fifteen
years
ago
he
did
not
then
know
whether
i
was
to
be
sold
but
wood
found
that
i
could
work
and
she
wanted
to
buy
me
her
husband
then
wrote
to
my
master
to
inquire
whether
i
was
to
be
sold
d
wrote
in
reply
that
i
should
not
be
sold
to
any
one
that
would
treat
me
it
was
strange
he
should
say
this
when
he
had
treated
me
so
ill
himself
so
i
was
purchased
by
wood
for
dollars
or
bermuda
currency
footnote
about
sterling
my
work
there
was
to
attend
the
chambers
and
nurse
the
child
and
to
go
down
to
the
pond
and
wash
clothes
but
i
soon
fell
ill
of
the
rheumatism
and
grew
so
very
lame
that
i
was
forced
to
walk
with
a
stick
i
got
the
saint
anthony
fire
also
in
my
left
leg
and
became
quite
a
cripple
no
one
cared
much
to
come
near
me
and
i
was
ill
a
long
long
time
for
several
months
i
could
not
lift
the
limb
i
had
to
lie
in
a
little
old
that
was
swarming
with
bugs
and
other
vermin
which
tormented
me
greatly
but
i
had
no
other
place
to
lie
in
i
got
the
rheumatism
by
catching
cold
at
the
pond
side
from
washing
in
the
fresh
water
in
the
salt
water
i
never
got
cold
the
person
who
lived
in
next
yard
a
greene
could
not
bear
to
hear
my
cries
and
groans
she
was
kind
and
used
to
send
an
old
slave
woman
to
help
me
who
sometimes
brought
me
a
little
soup
when
the
doctor
found
i
was
so
ill
he
said
i
must
be
put
into
a
bath
of
hot
water
the
old
slave
got
the
bark
of
some
bush
that
was
good
for
the
pains
which
she
boiled
in
the
hot
water
and
every
night
she
came
and
put
me
into
the
bath
and
did
what
she
could
for
me
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
or
what
would
have
become
of
me
had
it
not
been
for
my
mistress
it
is
true
did
send
me
a
little
food
but
no
one
from
our
family
came
near
me
but
the
cook
who
used
to
shove
my
food
in
at
the
door
and
say
molly
molly
there
your
dinner
my
mistress
did
not
care
to
take
any
trouble
about
me
and
if
the
lord
had
not
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
neighbours
to
be
kind
to
me
i
must
i
really
think
have
lain
and
died
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
got
well
enough
to
work
in
the
house
wood
in
the
meanwhile
hired
a
mulatto
woman
to
nurse
the
child
but
she
was
such
a
fine
lady
she
wanted
to
be
mistress
over
me
i
thought
it
very
hard
for
a
coloured
woman
to
have
rule
over
me
because
i
was
a
slave
and
she
was
free
her
name
was
martha
wilcox
she
was
a
saucy
woman
very
saucy
and
she
went
and
complained
of
me
without
cause
to
my
mistress
and
made
her
angry
with
me
wood
told
me
that
if
i
did
not
mind
what
i
was
about
she
would
get
my
master
to
strip
me
and
give
me
fifty
lashes
you
have
been
used
to
the
whip
she
said
and
you
shall
have
it
here
this
was
the
first
time
she
threatened
to
have
me
flogged
and
she
gave
me
the
threatening
so
strong
of
what
she
would
have
done
to
me
that
i
thought
i
should
have
fallen
down
at
her
feet
i
was
so
vexed
and
hurt
by
her
words
the
mulatto
woman
was
rejoiced
to
have
power
to
keep
me
down
she
was
constantly
making
mischief
there
was
no
living
for
the
slaves
no
peace
after
she
came
i
was
also
sent
by
wood
to
be
put
in
the
cage
one
night
and
was
next
morning
flogged
by
the
magistrate
order
at
her
desire
and
this
all
for
a
quarrel
i
had
about
a
pig
with
another
slave
woman
i
was
flogged
on
my
naked
back
on
this
occasion
although
i
was
in
no
fault
after
all
for
old
justice
dyett
when
we
came
before
him
said
that
i
was
in
the
right
and
ordered
the
pig
to
be
given
to
me
this
was
about
two
or
three
years
after
i
came
to
antigua
when
we
moved
from
the
middle
of
the
town
to
the
point
i
used
to
be
in
the
house
and
do
all
the
work
and
mind
the
children
though
still
very
ill
with
the
rheumatism
every
week
i
had
to
wash
two
large
bundles
of
clothes
as
much
as
a
boy
could
help
me
to
lift
but
i
could
give
no
satisfaction
my
mistress
was
always
abusing
and
fretting
after
me
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
all
her
ill
one
day
she
followed
me
foot
after
foot
scolding
and
rating
me
i
bore
in
silence
a
great
deal
of
ill
words
at
last
my
heart
was
quite
full
and
i
told
her
that
she
ought
not
to
use
me
so
that
when
i
was
ill
i
might
have
lain
and
died
for
what
she
cared
and
no
one
would
then
come
near
me
to
nurse
me
because
they
were
afraid
of
my
mistress
this
was
a
great
affront
she
called
her
husband
and
told
him
what
i
had
said
he
flew
into
a
passion
but
did
not
beat
me
then
he
only
abused
and
swore
at
me
and
then
gave
me
a
note
and
bade
me
go
and
look
for
an
owner
not
that
he
meant
to
sell
me
but
he
did
this
to
please
his
wife
and
to
frighten
me
i
went
to
adam
white
a
cooper
a
free
black
who
had
money
and
asked
him
to
buy
me
he
went
directly
to
wood
but
was
informed
that
i
was
not
to
be
sold
the
next
day
my
master
whipped
me
another
time
about
five
years
ago
my
mistress
got
vexed
with
me
because
i
fell
sick
and
i
could
not
keep
on
with
my
work
she
complained
to
her
husband
and
he
sent
me
off
again
to
look
for
an
owner
i
went
to
a
burchell
showed
him
the
note
and
asked
him
to
buy
me
for
my
own
benefit
for
i
had
saved
about
dollars
and
hoped
with
a
little
help
to
purchase
my
freedom
he
accordingly
went
to
my
master
wood
he
said
molly
has
brought
me
a
note
that
she
wants
an
owner
if
you
intend
to
sell
her
i
may
as
well
buy
her
as
another
my
master
put
him
off
and
said
that
he
did
not
mean
to
sell
me
i
was
very
sorry
at
this
for
i
had
no
comfort
with
wood
and
i
wished
greatly
to
get
my
freedom
the
way
in
which
i
made
my
money
was
when
my
master
and
mistress
went
from
home
as
they
sometimes
did
and
left
me
to
take
care
of
the
house
and
premises
i
had
a
good
deal
of
time
to
myself
and
made
the
most
of
it
i
took
in
washing
and
sold
coffee
and
yams
and
other
provisions
to
the
captains
of
ships
i
did
not
sit
still
idling
during
the
absence
of
my
owners
for
i
wanted
by
all
honest
means
to
earn
money
to
buy
my
freedom
sometimes
i
bought
a
hog
cheap
on
board
ship
and
sold
it
for
double
the
money
on
shore
and
i
also
earned
a
good
deal
by
selling
coffee
by
this
means
i
by
degrees
acquired
a
little
cash
a
gentleman
also
lent
me
some
to
help
to
buy
my
freedom
but
when
i
could
not
get
free
he
got
it
back
again
his
name
was
captain
abbot
my
master
and
mistress
went
on
one
occasion
into
the
country
to
date
hill
for
change
of
air
and
carried
me
with
them
to
take
charge
of
the
children
and
to
do
the
work
of
the
house
while
i
was
in
the
country
i
saw
how
the
field
negroes
are
worked
in
antigua
they
are
worked
very
hard
and
fed
but
scantily
they
are
called
out
to
work
before
daybreak
and
come
home
after
dark
and
then
each
has
to
heave
his
bundle
of
grass
for
the
cattle
in
the
pen
then
on
sunday
morning
each
slave
has
to
go
out
and
gather
a
large
bundle
of
grass
and
when
they
bring
it
home
they
have
all
to
sit
at
the
manager
door
and
wait
till
he
come
out
often
have
they
to
wait
there
till
past
eleven
without
any
breakfast
after
that
those
that
have
yams
or
potatoes
or
to
sell
hasten
to
market
to
buy
a
dog
worth
of
salt
fish
or
pork
which
is
a
great
treat
for
them
some
of
them
buy
a
little
pickle
out
of
the
shad
barrels
which
they
call
sauce
to
season
their
yams
and
indian
corn
it
is
very
wrong
i
know
to
work
on
sunday
or
go
to
market
but
will
not
god
call
the
buckra
men
to
answer
for
this
on
the
great
day
of
judgment
since
they
will
give
the
slaves
no
other
day

while
we
were
at

christmas
came
and
the
slave
woman
who
had
the
care
of
the
place
which
then
belonged
to
roberts
the
marshal
asked
me
to
go
with
her
to
her
husband
house
to
a
methodist
meeting
for
prayer
at
a
plantation
called
winthorps
i
went
and
they
were
the
first
prayers
i
ever
understood
one
woman
prayed
and
then
they
all
sung
a
hymn
then
there
was
another
prayer
and
another
hymn
and
then
they
all
spoke
by
turns
of
their
own
griefs
as
sinners
the
husband
of
the
woman
i
went
with
was
a
black
driver
his
name
was
henry
he
confessed
that
he
had
treated
the
slaves
very
cruelly
but
said
that
he
was
compelled
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
master
he
prayed
them
all
to
forgive
him
and
he
prayed
that
god
would
forgive
him
he
said
it
was
a
horrid
thing
for
a
ranger
to
have
sometimes
to
beat
his
own
wife
or
sister
but
he
must
do
so
if
ordered
by
his
master

the

i
felt
sorry
for
my
sins
also
i
cried
the
whole
night
but
i
was
too
much
ashamed
to
speak
i
prayed
god
to
forgive
me
this
meeting
had
a
great
impression
on
my
mind
and
led
my
spirit
to
the
moravian
church
so
that
when
i
got
back
to
town
i
went
and
prayed
to
have
my
name
put
down
in
the
missionaries
book
and
i
followed
the
church
earnestly
every
opportunity
i
did
not
then
tell
my
mistress
about
it
for
i
knew
that
she
would
not
give
me
leave
to
go
but
i
felt
i
go
whenever
i
carried
the
children
their
lunch
at
school
i
ran
round
and
went
to
hear
the
teachers
the
moravian
ladies
richter
olufsen
and
sauter
taught
me
to
read
in
the
class
and
i
got
on
very
fast
in
this
class
there
were
all
sorts
of
people
old
and
young
grey
headed
folks
and
children
but
most
of
them
were
free
people
after
we
had
done
spelling
we
tried
to
read
in
the
bible
after
the
reading
was
over
the
missionary
gave
out
a
hymn
for
us
to
sing
i
dearly
loved
to
go
to
the
church
it
was
so
solemn
i
never
knew
rightly
that
i
had
much
sin
till
i
went
there
when
i
found
out
that
i
was
a
great
sinner
i
was
very
sorely
grieved
and
very
much
frightened
i
used
to
pray
god
to
pardon
my
sins
for
christ
sake
and
forgive
me
for
every
thing
i
had
done
amiss
and
when
i
went
home
to
my
work
i
always
thought
about
what
i
had
heard
from
the
missionaries
and
wished
to
be
good
that
i
might
go
to
heaven
after
a
while
i
was
admitted
a
candidate
for
the
holy
i
had
been
baptized
long
before
this
in
august
by
the
rev
curtin
of
the
english
church
after
i
had
been
taught
to
repeat
the
creed
and
the
lord
prayer
i
wished
at
that
time
to
attend
a
sunday
school
taught
by
curtin
but
he
would
not
receive
me
without
a
written
note
from
my
master
granting
his
permission
i
did
not
ask
my
owner
permission
from
the
belief
that
it
would
be
refused
so
that
i
got
no
farther
instruction
at
that
time
from
the
english
church
footnote
she
possesses
a
copy
of
mrs
trimmer
charity
school
spelling
book
presented
to
her
by
the
rev
curtin
and
dated
august
in
this
book
her
name
is
written
mary
princess
of
wales
an
appellation
which
she
says
was
given
her
by
her
owners
it
is
a
common
practice
with
the
colonists
to
give
ridiculous
names
of
this
description
to
their
slaves
being
in
fact
one
of
the
numberless
modes
of
expressing
the
habitual
contempt
with
which
they
regard
the
negro
in
printing
this
narrative
we
have
retained
mary
paternal
name
of
some
time
after
i
began
to
attend
the
moravian
church
i
met
with
daniel
james
afterwards
my
dear
husband
he
was
a
carpenter
and
cooper
to
his
trade
an
honest
decent
black
man
and
a
widower
he
had
purchased
his
freedom
of
his
mistress
old
baker
with
money
he
had
earned
whilst
a
slave
when
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
took
time
to
consider
the
matter
over
with
myself
and
would
not
say
yes
till
he
went
to
church
with
me
and
joined
the
moravians
he
was
very
industrious
after
he
bought
his
freedom
and
he
had
hired
a
comfortable
house
and
had
convenient
things
about
him
we
were
joined
in
marriage
about
christmas
in
the
moravian
chapel
at
spring
gardens
by
the
rev
olufsen
we
could
not
be
married
in
the
english
church
english
marriage
is
not
allowed
to
slaves
and
no
free
man
can
marry
a
slave
woman
when
wood
heard
of
my
marriage
he
flew
into
a
great
rage
and
sent
for
daniel
who
was
helping
to
build
a
house
for
his
old
mistress
wood
asked
him
who
gave
him
a
right
to
marry
a
slave
of
his
my
husband
said
sir
i
am
a
free
man
and
thought
i
had
a
right
to
choose
a
wife
but
if
i
had
known
molly
was
not
allowed
to
have
a
husband
i
should
not
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
wood
was
more
vexed
about
my
marriage
than
her
husband
she
could
not
forgive
me
for
getting
married
but
stirred
up
wood
to
flog
me
dreadfully
with
the
horsewhip
i
thought
it
very
hard
to
be
whipped
at
my
time
of
life
for
getting
a
husband
i
told
her
so
she
said
that
she
would
not
have
nigger
men
about
the
yards
and
premises
or
allow
a
nigger
man
clothes
to
be
washed
in
the
same
tub
where
hers
were
washed
she
was
fearful
i
think
that
i
should
lose
her
time
in
order
to
wash
and
do
things
for
my
husband
but
i
had
then
no
time
to
wash
for
myself
i
was
obliged
to
put
out
my
own
clothes
though
i
was
always
at
the
i
had
not
much
happiness
in
my
marriage
owing
to
my
being
a
slave
it
made
my
husband
sad
to
see
me
so
wood
was
always
abusing
me
about
him
she
did
not
lick
me
herself
but
she
got
her
husband
to
do
it
for
her
whilst
she
fretted
the
flesh
off
my
bones
yet
for
all
this
she
would
not
sell
me
she
sold
five
slaves
whilst
i
was
with
her
but
though
she
was
always
finding
fault
with
me
she
would
not
part
with
me
however
wood
afterwards
allowed
daniel
to
have
a
place
to
live
in
our
yard
which
we
were
very
thankful
for
after
this
i
fell
ill
again
with
the
rheumatism
and
was
sick
a
long
time
but
whether
sick
or
well
i
had
my
work
to
do
about
this
time
i
asked
my
master
and
mistress
to
let
me
buy
my
own
freedom
with
the
help
of
burchell
i
could
have
found
the
means
to
pay
wood
for
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
afterwards
serve
burchell
a
while
for
the
cash
he
was
to
advance
for
me
i
was
earnest
in
the
request
to
my
owners
but
their
hearts
were
hard
too
hard
to
consent
wood
was
very
angry
she
grew
quite
outrageous
she
called
me
a
black
devil
and
asked
me
who
had
put
freedom
into
my
head
to
be
free
is
very
sweet
i
said
but
she
took
good
care
to
keep
me
a
slave
i
saw
her
change
colour
and
i
left
the
room
about
this
time
my
master
and
mistress
were
going
to
england
to
put
their
son
to
school
and
bring
their
daughters
home
and
they
took
me
with
them
to
take
care
of
the
child
i
was
willing
to
come
to
england
i
thought
that
by
going
there
i
should
probably
get
cured
of
my
rheumatism
and
should
return
with
my
master
and
mistress
quite
well
to
my
husband
my
husband
was
willing
for
me
to
come
away
for
he
had
heard
that
my
master
would
free
me
and
i
also
hoped
this
might
prove
true
but
it
was
all
a
false
report
the
steward
of
the
ship
was
very
kind
to
me
he
and
my
husband
were
in
the
same
class
in
the
moravian
church
i
was
thankful
that
he
was
so
friendly
for
my
mistress
was
not
kind
to
me
on
the
passage
and
she
told
me
when
she
was
angry
that
she
did
not
intend
to
treat
me
any
better
in
england
than
in
the
west
indies
that
i
need
not
expect
it
and
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
when
we
drew
near
to
england
the
rheumatism
seized
all
my
limbs
worse
than
ever
and
my
body
was
dreadfully
swelled
when
we
landed
at
the
tower
i
shewed
my
flesh
to
my
mistress
but
she
took
no
great
notice
of
it
we
were
obliged
to
stop
at
the
tavern
till
my
master
got
a
house
and
a
day
or
two
after
my
mistress
sent
me
down
into
the
to
learn
to
wash
in
the
english
way
in
the
west
indies
we
wash
with
cold
water
in
england
with
hot
i
told
my
mistress
i
was
afraid
that
putting
my
hands
first
into
the
hot
water
and
then
into
the
cold
would
increase
the
pain
in
my
limbs
the
doctor
had
told
my
mistress
long
before
i
came
from
the
west
indies
that
i
was
a
sickly
body
and
the
washing
did
not
agree
with
me
but
wood
would
not
release
me
from
the
tub
so
i
was
forced
to
do
as
i
could
i
grew
worse
and
could
not
stand
to
wash
i
was
then
forced
to
sit
down
with
the
tub
before
me
and
often
through
pain
and
weakness
was
reduced
to
kneel
or
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
to
finish
my
task
when
i
complained
to
my
mistress
of
this
she
only
got
into
a
passion
as
usual
and
said
washing
in
hot
water
could
not
hurt
any
one
that
i
was
lazy
and
insolent
and
wanted
to
be
free
of
my
work
but
that
she
would
make
me
do
it
i
thought
her
very
hard
on
me
and
my
heart
rose
up
within
me
however
i
kept
still
at
that
time
and
went
down
again
to
wash
the
child
things
but
the
english
washerwomen
who
were
at
work
there
when
they
saw
that
i
was
so
ill
had
pity
upon
me
and
washed
them
for
me
after
that
when
we
came
up
to
live
in
leigh
street
wood
sorted
out
five
bags
of
clothes
which
we
had
used
at
sea
and
also
such
as
had
been
worn
since
we
came
on
shore
for
me
and
the
cook
to
elizabeth
the
cook
told
her
that
she
did
not
think
that
i
was
able
to
stand
to
the
tub
and
that
she
had
better
hire
a
woman
i
also
said
myself
that
i
had
come
over
to
nurse
the
child
and
that
i
was
sorry
i
had
come
from
antigua
since
mistress
would
work
me
so
hard
without
compassion
for
my
rheumatism
and
wood
when
they
heard
this
rose
up
in
a
passion
against
me
they
opened
the
door
and
bade
me
get
out
but
i
was
a
stranger
and
did
not
know
one
door
in
the
street
from
another
and
was
unwilling
to
go
away
they
made
a
dreadful
uproar
and
from
that
day
they
constantly
kept
cursing
and
abusing
me
i
was
obliged
to
wash
though
i
was
very
wood
indeed
once
hired
a
washerwoman
but
she
was
not
well
treated
and
would
come
no
more
my
master
quarrelled
with
me
another
time
about
one
of
our
great
washings
his
wife
having
stirred
him
up
to
do
so
he
said
he
would
compel
me
to
do
the
whole
of
the
washing
given
out
to
me
or
if
i
again
refused
he
would
take
a
short
course
with
me
he
would
either
send
me
down
to
the
brig
in
the
river
to
carry
me
back
to
antigua
or
he
would
turn
me
at
once
out
of
doors
and
let
me
provide
for
myself
i
said
i
would
willingly
go
back
if
he
would
let
me
purchase
my
own
freedom
but
this
enraged
him
more
than
all
the
rest
he
cursed
and
swore
at
me
dreadfully
and
said
he
would
never
sell
my
freedom
if
i
wished
to
be
free
i
was
free
in
england
and
i
might
go
and
try
what
freedom
would
do
for
me
and
be
d
my
heart
was
very
sore
with
this
treatment
but
i
had
to
go
on
i
continued
to
do
my
work
and
did
all
i
could
to
give
satisfaction
but
all
would
not
do
shortly
after
the
cook
left
them
and
then
matters
went
on
ten
times
worse
i
always
washed
the
child
clothes
without
being
commanded
to
do
it
and
any
thing
else
that
was
wanted
in
the
family
though
still
i
was
very
sick
very
sick
indeed
when
the
great
washing
came
round
which
was
every
two
months
my
mistress
got
together
again
a
great
many
heavy
things
such
as
for
me
to
wash
i
told
her
i
was
too
ill
to
wash
such
heavy
things
that
day
she
said
she
supposed
i
thought
myself
a
free
woman
but
i
was
not
and
if
i
did
not
do
it
directly
i
should
be
instantly
turned
out
of
doors
i
stood
a
long
time
before
i
could
answer
for
i
did
not
know
well
what
to
do
i
knew
that
i
was
free
in
england
but
i
did
not
know
where
to
go
or
how
to
get
my
living
and
therefore
i
did
not
like
to
leave
the
house
but
wood
said
he
would
send
for
a
constable
to
thrust
me
out
and
at
last
i
took
courage
and
resolved
that
i
would
not
be
longer
thus
treated
but
would
go
and
trust
to
providence
this
was
the
fourth
time
they
had
threatened
turn
me
out
and
go
where
i
might
i
was
determined
now
to
take
them
at
their
word
though
i
thought
it
very
hard
after
i
had
lived
with
them
for
thirteen
years
and
worked
for
them
like
a
horse
to
be
driven
out
in
this
way
like
a
beggar
my
only
fault
was
being
sick
and
therefore
unable
to
please
my
mistress
who
thought
she
never
could
get
work
enough
out
of
her
slaves
and
i
told
them
so
but
they
only
abused
me
and
drove
me
out
this
took
place
from
two
to
three
months
i
think
after
we
came
to
england
when
i
came
away
i
went
to
the
man
one
mash
who
used
to
black
the
shoes
of
the
family
and
asked
his
wife
to
get
somebody
to
go
with
me
to
hatton
garden
to
the
moravian
missionaries
these
were
the
only
persons
i
knew
in
england
the
woman
sent
a
young
girl
with
me
to
the
mission
house
and
i
saw
there
a
gentleman
called
moore
i
told
him
my
whole
story
and
how
my
owners
had
treated
me
and
asked
him
to
take
in
my
trunk
with
what
few
clothes
i
had
the
missionaries
were
very
kind
to
me
they
were
sorry
for
my
destitute
situation
and
gave
me
leave
to
bring
my
things
to
be
placed
under
their
care
they
were
very
good
people
and
they
told
me
to
come
to
the
church
when
i
went
back
to
wood
to
get
my
trunk
i
saw
a
lady
pell
who
was
on
a
visit
to
my
mistress
when
and
wood
heard
me
come
in
they
set
this
lady
to
stop
me
finding
that
they
had
gone
too
far
with
me
pell
came
out
to
me
and
said
are
you
really
going
to
leave
molly
do
leave
but
come
into
the
country
with
me
i
believe
she
said
this
because
she
thought
wood
would
easily
get
me
back
again
i
replied
to
her
this
is
the
fourth
time
my
master
and
mistress
have
driven
me
out
or
threatened
to
drive
me
and
i
will
give
them
no
more
occasion
to
bid
me
go
i
was
not
willing
to
leave
them
for
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
country
but
now
i
must
go
i
can
stay
no
longer
to
be
so
used
pell
then
went
up
stairs
to
my
mistress
and
told
that
i
would
go
and
that
she
could
not
stop
me
wood
was
very
much
hurt
and
frightened
when
she
found
i
was
determined
to
go
out
that
day
she
said
if
she
goes
the
people
will
rob
her
and
then
turn
her
adrift
she
did
not
say
this
to
me
but
she
spoke
it
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
that
it
might
induce
me
not
to
go
i
suppose
wood
also
asked
me
where
i
was
going
to
i
told
him
where
i
had
been
and
that
i
should
never
have
gone
away
had
i
not
been
driven
out
by
my
owners
he
had
given
me
a
written
paper
some
time
before
which
said
that
i
had
come
with
them
to
england
by
my
own
desire
and
that
was
true
it
said
also
that
i
left
them
of
my
own
free
will
because
i
was
a
free
woman
in
england
and
that
i
was
idle
and
would
not
do
my
work
which
was
not
true
i
gave
this
paper
afterwards
to
a
gentleman
who
inquired
into
my
case
footnote
see
page
i
went
into
the
kitchen
and
got
my
clothes
out
the
nurse
and
the
servant
girl
were
there
and
i
said
to
the
man
who
was
going
to
take
out
my
trunk
stop
before
you
take
up
this
trunk
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
before
these
people
i
am
going
out
of
this
house
as
i
was
ordered
but
i
have
done
no
wrong
at
all
to
my
owners
neither
here
nor
in
the
west
indies
i
always
worked
very
hard
to
please
them
both
by
night
and
day
but
there
was
no
giving
satisfaction
for
my
mistress
could
never
be
satisfied
with
reasonable
service
i
told
my
mistress
i
was
sick
and
yet
she
has
ordered
me
out
of
doors
this
is
the
fourth
time
and
now
i
am
going
out
and
so
i
came
out
and
went
and
carried
my
trunk
to
the
moravians
i
then
returned
back
to
mash
the
house
and
begged
his
wife
to
take
me
in
i
had
a
little
west
indian
money
in
my
trunk
and
they
got
it
changed
for
me
this
helped
to
support
me
for
a
little
while
the
wife
was
very
kind
to
me
i
was
very
sick
and
she
boiled
nourishing
things
up
for
me
she
also
sent
for
a
doctor
to
see
me
and
he
sent
me
medicine
which
did
me
good
though
i
was
ill
for
a
long
time
with
the
rheumatic
pains
i
lived
a
good
many
months
with
these
poor
people
and
they
nursed
me
and
did
all
that
lay
in
their
power
to
serve
me
the
man
was
well
acquainted
with
my
situation
as
he
used
to
go
to
and
fro
to
wood
house
to
clean
shoes
and
knives
and
he
and
his
wife
were
sorry
for
me
about
this
time
a
woman
of
the
name
of
hill
told
me
of
the
society
and
went
with
me
to
their
office
to
inquire
if
they
could
do
any
thing
to
get
me
my
freedom
and
send
me
back
to
the
west
indies
the
gentlemen
of
the
society
took
me
to
a
lawyer
who
examined
very
strictly
into
my
case
but
told
me
that
the
laws
of
england
could
do
nothing
to
make
me
free
in
antigua
however
they
did
all
they
could
for
me
they
gave
me
a
little
money
from
time
to
time
to
keep
me
from
want
and
some
of
them
went
to
wood
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
let
me
return
a
free
woman
to
my
husband
but
though
they
offered
him
as
i
have
heard
a
large
sum
for
my
freedom
he
was
sulky
and
obstinate
and
would
not
consent
to
let
me
go
free

about
the

her
case
was
referred
to
george

this
was
the
first
winter
i
spent
in
england
and
i
suffered
much
from
the
severe
cold
and
from
the
rheumatic
pains
which
still
at
times
torment
me
however
providence
was
very
good
to
me
and
i
got
many
friends
especially
some
quaker
ladies
who
hearing
of
my
case
came
and
sought
me
out
and
gave
me
good
warm
clothing
and
money
thus
i
had
great
cause
to
bless
god
in
my
affliction
when
i
got
better
i
was
anxious
to
get
some
work
to
do
as
i
was
unwilling
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
mash
who
was
a
laundress
recommended
me
to
a
lady
for
a
charwoman
she
paid
me
very
handsomely
for
what
work
i
did
and
i
divided
the
money
with
mash
for
though
very
poor
they
gave
me
food
when
my
own
money
was
done
and
never
suffered
me
to
want
in
the
spring
i
got
into
service
with
a
lady
who
saw
me
at
the
house
where
i
sometimes
worked
as
a
charwoman
this
lady
name
was
forsyth
she
had
been
in
the
west
indies
and
was
accustomed
to
blacks
and
liked
them
i
was
with
her
six
months
and
went
with
her
to
margate
she
treated
me
well
and
gave
me
a
good
character
when
she
left
london
footnote
she
refers
to
a
written
certificate
which
will
be
inserted
afterwards
after
forsyth
went
away
i
was
again
out
of
place
and
went
to
lodgings
for
which
i
paid
two
shillings
a
week
and
found
coals
and
candle
after
eleven
weeks
the
money
i
had
saved
in
service
was
all
gone
and
i
was
forced
to
go
back
to
the
office
to
ask
a
supply
till
i
could
get
another
situation
i
did
not
like
to
go
back
i
did
not
like
to
be
idle
i
would
rather
work
for
my
living
than
get
it
for
nothing
they
were
very
good
to
give
me
a
supply
but
i
felt
shame
at
being
obliged
to
apply
for
relief
whilst
i
had
strength
to
work
at
last
i
went
into
the
service
of
and
pringle
where
i
have
been
ever
since
and
am
as
comfortable
as
i
can
be
while
separated
from
my
dear
husband
and
away
from
my
own
country
and
all
old
friends
and
connections
my
dear
mistress
teaches
me
daily
to
read
the
word
of
god
and
takes
great
pains
to
make
me
understand
it
i
enjoy
the
great
privilege
of
being
enabled
to
attend
church
three
times
on
the
sunday
and
i
have
met
with
many
kind
friends
since
i
have
been
here
both
clergymen
and
others
the
rev
young
who
lives
in
the
next
house
has
shown
me
much
kindness
and
taken
much
pains
to
instruct
me
particularly
while
my
master
and
mistress
were
absent
in
scotland
nor
must
i
forget
among
my
friends
the
rev
mortimer
the
good
clergyman
of
the
parish
under
whose
ministry
i
have
now
sat
for
upwards
of
twelve
months
i
trust
in
god
i
have
profited
by
what
i
have
heard
from
him
he
never
keeps
back
the
truth
and
i
think
he
has
been
the
means
of
opening
my
eyes
and
ears
much
better
to
understand
the
word
of
god
mortimer
tells
me
that
he
can
not
open
the
eyes
of
my
heart
but
that
i
must
pray
to
god
to
change
my
heart
and
make
me
to
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
will
make
me
free
i
still
live
in
the
hope
that
god
will
find
a
way
to
give
me
my
liberty
and
give
me
back
to
my
husband
i
endeavour
to
keep
down
my
fretting
and
to
leave
all
to
him
for
he
knows
what
is
good
for
me
better
than
i
know
myself
yet
i
must
confess
i
find
it
a
hard
and
heavy
task
to
do
so
i
am
often
much
vexed
and
i
feel
great
sorrow
when
i
hear
some
people
in
this
country
say
that
the
slaves
do
not
need
better
usage
and
do
not
want
to
be
free
they
believe
the
foreign
people
who
deceive
them
and
say
slaves
are
happy
i
say
not
so
how
can
slaves
be
happy
when
they
have
the
halter
round
their
neck
and
the
whip
upon
their
back
and
are
disgraced
and
thought
no
more
of
than
beasts
and
are
separated
from
their
mothers
and
husbands
and
children
and
sisters
just
as
cattle
are
sold
and
separated
is
it
happiness
for
a
driver
in
the
field
to
take
down
his
wife
or
sister
or
child
and
strip
them
and
whip
them
in
such
a
disgraceful
manner
women
that
have
had
children
exposed
in
the
open
field
to
shame
there
is
no
modesty
or
decency
shown
by
the
owner
to
his
slaves
men
women
and
children
are
exposed
alike
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
often
wondered
how
english
people
can
go
out
into
the
west
indies
and
act
in
such
a
beastly
manner
but
when
they
go
to
the
west
indies
they
forget
god
and
all
feeling
of
shame
i
think
since
they
can
see
and
do
such
things
they
tie
up
slaves
like
hogs
moor
them
up
like
cattle
and
they
lick
them
so
as
hogs
or
cattle
or
horses
never
were
flogged
and
yet
they
come
home
and
say
and
make
some
good
people
believe
that
slaves
do
want
to
get
out
of
slavery
but
they
put
a
cloak
about
the
truth
it
is
not
so
all
slaves
want
to
be
free
to
be
free
is
very
sweet
i
will
say
the
truth
to
english
people
who
may
read
this
history
that
my
good
friend
miss
s
is
now
writing
down
for
me
i
have
been
a
slave
myself
i
know
what
slaves
feel
i
can
tell
by
myself
what
other
slaves
feel
and
by
what
they
have
told
me
the
man
that
says
slaves
be
quite
happy
in
slavery
that
they
do
want
to
be
free
that
man
is
either
ignorant
or
a
lying
person
i
never
heard
a
slave
say
so
i
never
heard
a
buckra
man
say
so
till
i
heard
tell
of
it
in
england
such
people
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
they
ca
do
without
slaves
they
say
what
the
reason
they
ca
do
without
slaves
as
well
as
in
england
no
slaves
here
no
whips
no
stocks
no
punishment
except
for
wicked
people
they
hire
servants
in
england
and
if
they
do
like
them
they
send
them
away
they
ca
lick
them
let
them
work
ever
so
hard
in
england
they
are
far
better
off
than
slaves
if
they
get
a
bad
master
they
give
warning
and
go
hire
to
another
they
have
their
liberty
just
what
we
want
we
do
mind
hard
work
if
we
had
proper
treatment
and
proper
wages
like
english
servants
and
proper
time
given
in
the
week
to
keep
us
from
breaking
the
sabbath
but
they
wo
give
it
they
will
have
work
work
work
night
and
day
sick
or
well
till
we
are
quite
done
up
and
we
must
not
speak
up
nor
look
amiss
however
much
we
be
abused
and
then
when
we
are
quite
done
up
who
cares
for
us
more
than
for
a
lame
horse
this
is
slavery
i
tell
it
to
let
english
people
know
the
truth
and
i
hope
they
will
never
leave
off
to
pray
god
and
call
loud
to
the
great
king
of
england
till
all
the
poor
blacks
be
given
free
and
slavery
done
up
for
evermore

to

of
mary
prince
by
the
editor
leaving
mary
narrative
for
the
present
without
comment
to
the
reflections
i
proceed
to
state
some
circumstances
connected
with
her
case
which
have
fallen
more
particularly
under
my
own
notice
and
which
i
consider
it
incumbent
now
to
lay
fully
before
the
public
about
the
latter
end
of
november
this
poor
woman
found
her
way
to
the
office
of
the
society
in
aldermanbury
by
the
aid
of
a
person
who
had
become
acquainted
with
her
situation
and
had
advised
her
to
apply
there
for
advice
and
assistance
after
some
preliminary
examination
into
the
accuracy
of
the
circumstances
related
by
her
i
went
along
with
her
to
george
stephen
solicitor
and
requested
him
to
investigate
and
draw
up
a
statement
of
her
case
and
have
it
submitted
to
counsel
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
under
the
circumstances
her
freedom
could
be
legally
established
on
her
return
to
antigua
on
this
occasion
in
stephen
presence
and
mine
she
expressed
in
very
strong
terms
her
anxiety
to
return
thither
if
she
could
go
as
a
free
person
and
at
the
same
time
her
extreme
apprehensions
of
the
fate
that
would
probably
await
her
if
she
returned
as
a
slave
her
words
were
i
would
rather
go
into
my
grave
than
go
back
a
slave
to
antigua
though
i
wish
to
go
back
to
my
husband
very
much
very
much
very
much
i
am
much
afraid
my
owners
would
separate
me
from
my
husband
and
use
me
very
hard
or
perhaps
sell
me
for
a
field
negro
and
slavery
is
too
too
bad
i
would
rather
go
into
my
grave
the
paper
which
wood
had
given
her
before
she
left
his
house
was
placed
by
her
in
stephen
hands
it
was
expressed
in
the
following
terms
i
have
already
told
molly
and
now
give
it
her
in
writing
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
misunderstanding
on
her
part
that
as
i
brought
her
from
antigua
at
her
own
request
and
entreaty
and
that
she
is
consequently
now
free
she
is
of
course
at
liberty
to
take
her
baggage
and
go
where
she
pleases
and
in
consequence
of
her
late
conduct
she
must
do
one
of
two
things
either
quit
the
house
or
return
to
antigua
by
the
earliest
opportunity
as
she
does
not
evince
a
disposition
to
make
herself
useful
as
she
is
a
stranger
in
london
i
do
not
wish
to
turn
her
out
or
would
do
so
as
two
female
servants
are
sufficient
for
my
establishment
if
after
this
she
does
remain
it
will
be
only
during
her
good
behaviour
but
on
no
consideration
will
i
allow
her
wages
or
any
other
remuneration
for
her
services
john
a

london
august
this
paper
though
not
devoid
of
inconsistencies
which
will
be
apparent
to
any
attentive
reader
is
craftily
expressed
and
was
well
devised
to
serve
the
purpose
which
the
writer
had
obviously
in
view
namely
to
frustrate
any
appeal
which
the
friendless
black
woman
might
make
to
the
sympathy
of
strangers
and
thus
prevent
her
from
obtaining
an
asylum
if
she
left
his
house
from
any
respectable
family
as
she
had
no
one
to
refer
to
for
a
character
in
this
country
except
himself
he
doubtless
calculated
securely
on
her
being
speedily
driven
back
as
soon
as
the
slender
fund
she
had
in
her
possession
was
expended
to
throw
herself
unconditionally
upon
his
tender
mercies
and
his
disappointment
in
this
expectation
appears
to
have
exasperated
his
feelings
of
resentment
towards
the
poor
woman
to
a
degree
which
few
persons
alive
to
the
claims
of
common
justice
not
to
speak
of
christianity
or
common
humanity
could
easily
have
anticipated
such
at
least
seems
the
only
intelligible
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
his
subsequent
conduct
the
case
having
been
submitted
by
desire
of
the
committee
to
the
consideration
of
lushington
and
mr
sergeant
stephen
it
was
found
that
there
existed
no
legal
means
of
compelling
mary
master
to
grant
her
manumission
and
that
if
she
returned
to
antigua
she
would
inevitably
fall
again
under
his
power
or
that
of
his
attorneys
as
a
slave
it
was
however
resolved
to
try
what
could
be
effected
for
her
by
amicable
negotiation
and
with
this
view
ravenscroft
a
solicitor
stephen
relative
called
upon
wood
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
he
would
consent
to
mary
manumission
on
any
reasonable
terms
and
to
refer
if
required
the
amount
of
compensation
for
her
value
to
arbitration
ravenscroft
with
some
difficulty
obtained
one
or
two
interviews
but
found
wood
so
full
of
animosity
against
the
woman
and
so
firmly
bent
against
any
arrangement
having
her
freedom
for
its
object
that
the
negotiation
was
soon
broken
off
as
hopeless
the
angry
declared
that
he
would
not
move
a
finger
about
her
in
this
country
or
grant
her
manumission
on
any
terms
whatever
and
that
if
she
went
back
to
the
west
indies
she
must
take
the
consequences
this
unreasonable
conduct
of
wood
induced
the
committee
after
several
other
abortive
attempts
to
effect
a
compromise
to
think
of
bringing
the
case
under
the
notice
of
parliament
the
heads
of
statement
were
accordingly
engrossed
in
a
petition
which
lushington
offered
to
present
and
to
give
notice
at
the
same
time
of
his
intention
to
bring
in
a
bill
to
provide
for
the
entire
emancipation
of
all
slaves
brought
to
england
with
the
owner
consent
but
before
this
step
was
taken
lushington
again
had
recourse
to
negotiation
with
the
master
and
partly
through
the
friendly
intervention
of
manning
partly
by
personal
conference
used
every
persuasion
in
his
power
to
induce
wood
to
relent
and
let
the
bondwoman
go
free
seeing
the
matter
thus
seriously
taken
up
wood
became
at
length
alarmed
not
relishing
it
appears
the
idea
of
having
the
case
publicly
discussed
in
the
house
of
commons
and
to
avert
this
result
he
submitted
to
temporize
assumed
a
demeanour
of
unwonted
civility
and
even
hinted
to
manning
as
i
was
given
to
understand
that
if
he
was
not
driven
to
utter
hostility
by
the
threatened
exposure
he
would
probably
meet
our
wishes
in
his
own
time
and
way
having
gained
time
by
these
manoeuvres
he
adroitly
endeavoured
to
cool
the
ardour
of
mary
new
friends
in
her
cause
by
representing
her
as
an
abandoned
and
worthless
woman
ungrateful
towards
him
and
undeserving
of
sympathy
from
others
allegations
which
he
supported
by
the
ready
affirmation
of
some
of
his
west
india
friends
and
by
one
or
two
plausible
letters
procured
from
antigua
by
these
and
like
artifices
he
appears
completely
to
have
imposed
on
manning
the
respectable
west
india
merchant
whom
lushington
had
asked
to
negotiate
with
him
and
he
prevailed
so
far
as
to
induce
lushington
himself
actuated
by
the
benevolent
view
of
thereby
best
serving
mary
cause
to
abstain
from
any
remarks
upon
his
conduct
when
the
petition
was
at
last
presented
in
parliament
in
this
way
he
dextrously
contrived
to
neutralize
all
our
efforts
until
the
close
of
the
session
of
soon
after
which
he
embarked
with
his
family
for
the
west
indies
every
exertion
for
mary
relief
having
thus
failed
and
being
fully
convinced
from
a
twelvemonth
observation
of
her
conduct
that
she
was
really
a
and
respectable
woman
i
engaged
her
in
december
as
a
domestic
servant
in
my
own
family
in
this
capacity
she
has
remained
ever
since
and
i
am
thus
enabled
to
speak
of
her
conduct
and
character
with
a
degree
of
confidence
i
could
not
have
otherwise
done
the
importance
of
this
circumstance
will
appear
in
the
sequel
from
the
time
of
wood
departure
to
antigua
in
till
june
or
july
last
no
farther
effort
was
attempted
for
mary
relief
some
faint
hope
was
still
cherished
that
this
unconscionable
man
would
at
length
relent
and
in
his
own
time
and
way
grant
the
prayer
of
the
exiled
negro
woman
after
waiting
however
nearly
twelve
months
longer
and
seeing
the
poor
woman
spirits
daily
sinking
under
the
sickening
influence
of
hope
deferred
i
resolved
on
a
final
attempt
in
her
behalf
through
the
intervention
of
the
moravian
missionaries
and
of
the
governor
of
antigua
at
my
request
edward
moore
agent
of
the
moravian
brethren
in
london
wrote
to
the
rev
joseph
newby
their
missionary
in
that
island
empowering
him
to
negotiate
in
his
own
name
with
wood
for
mary
manumission
and
to
procure
his
consent
if
possible
upon
terms
of
ample
pecuniary
compensation
at
the
same
time
the
excellent
and
benevolent
william
allen
of
the
society
of
friends
wrote
to
sir
patrick
ross
the
governor
of
the
colony
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
friendship
soliciting
him
to
use
his
influence
in
persuading
wood
to
consent
and
i
confess
i
was
sanguine
enough
to
flatter
myself
that
we
should
thus
at
length
prevail
the
result
proved
however
that
i
had
not
yet
fully
appreciated
the
character
of
the
man
we
had
to
deal
with
newby
answer
arrived
early
in
november
last
mentioning
that
he
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
accomplish
our
purpose
but
in
vain
and
that
if
mary
manumission
could
not
be
obtained
without
wood
consent
he
believed
there
was
no
prospect
of
its
ever
being
effected
a
few
weeks
afterwards
i
was
informed
by
allen
that
he
had
received
a
letter
from
sir
patrick
ross
stating
that
he
also
had
used
his
best
endeavours
in
the
affair
but
equally
without
effect
sir
patrick
at
the
same
time
inclosed
a
letter
addressed
by
wood
to
his
secretary
taylor
assigning
his
reasons
for
persisting
in
this
extraordinary
course
this
letter
requires
our
special
attention
its
tenor
is
as
follows
my
dear
sir
in
reply
to
your
note
relative
to
the
woman
molly
i
beg
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
oblige
me
by
assuring
his
excellency
that
i
regret
exceedingly
my
inability
to
comply
with
his
request
which
under
other
circumstances
would
afford
me
very
great
pleasure
there
are
many
and
powerful
reasons
for
inducing
me
to
refuse
my
sanction
to
her
returning
here
in
the
way
she
seems
to
wish
it
would
be
to
reward
the
worst
species
of
ingratitude
and
subject
myself
to
insult
whenever
she
came
in
my
way
her
moral
character
is
very
bad
as
the
police
records
will
shew
and
she
would
be
a
very
troublesome
character
should
she
come
here
without
any
restraint
she
is
not
a
native
of
this
country
and
i
know
of
no
relation
she
has
here
i
induced
her
to
take
a
husband
a
short
time
before
she
left
this
by
providing
a
comfortable
house
in
my
yard
for
them
and
prohibiting
her
going
out
after
to
our
without
special
leave
this
she
considered
the
greatest
and
indeed
the
only
grievance
she
ever
complained
of
and
all
my
efforts
could
not
prevent
it
in
hopes
of
inducing
her
to
be
steady
to
her
husband
who
was
a
free
man
i
gave
him
the
house
to
occupy
during
our
absence
but
it
appears
the
attachment
was
too
loose
to
bind
her
and
he
has
taken
another
wife
so
on
that
score
i
do
her
no
in
england
she
made
her
election
and
quitted
my
family
this
i
had
no
right
to
object
to
and
i
should
have
thought
no
more
of
it
but
not
satisfied
to
leave
quietly
she
gave
every
trouble
and
annoyance
in
her
power
and
endeavoured
to
injure
the
character
of
my
family
by
the
most
vile
and
infamous
falsehoods
which
was
embodied
in
a
petition
to
the
house
of
commons
and
would
have
been
presented
had
not
my
friends
from
this
island
particularly
the
hon
byam
and
coull
come
forward
and
disproved
what
she
had
asserted
it
would
be
beyond
the
limits
of
an
ordinary
letter
to
detail
her
baseness
though
i
will
do
so
should
his
excellency
wish
it
but
you
may
judge
of
her
depravity
by
one
circumstance
which
came
out
before
justice
dyett
in
a
quarrel
with
another
female
such
a
thing
i
could
not
have
believed
possible
footnote
i
omit
the
circumstance
here
mentioned
because
it
is
too
indecent
to
appear
in
a
publication
likely
to
be
perused
by
females
it
is
in
all
probability
a
vile
calumny
but
even
if
it
were
perfectly
true
it
would
not
serve
wood
case
one
any
reader
who
wishes
it
may
see
the
passage
referred
to
in
the
autograph
letter
in
my
possession
losing
her
value
as
a
slave
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
i
consider
of
no
consequence
for
it
was
our
intention
had
she
conducted
herself
properly
and
returned
with
us
to
have
given
her
freedom
she
has
taken
her
freedom
and
all
i
wish
is
that
she
would
enjoy
it
without
meddling
with
me
let
me
again
repeat
if
his
excellency
wishes
it
it
will
afford
me
great
pleasure
to
state
such
particulars
of
her
and
which
will
be
incontestably
proved
by
numbers
here
that
i
am
sure
will
acquit
me
in
his
opinion
of
acting
unkind
or
ungenerous
towards
her
i
say
nothing
of
the
liability
i
should
incur
under
the
consolidated
slave
law
of
dealing
with
a
free
person
as
a
slave
my
only
excuse
for
entering
so
much
into
detail
must
be
that
of
my
anxious
wish
to
stand
justified
in
his
excellency
opinion
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
john
a
wood
oct
taylor
c
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
was
at
her
own
special
request
that
she
accompanied
me
to
england
and
also
that
she
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
with
her
which
she
had
saved
in
my
service
i
knew
of
to
at
least
for
i
had
some
trouble
to
recover
it
from
a
white
man
to
whom
she
had
lent
it
j
such
is
wood
justification
of
his
conduct
in
thus
obstinately
refusing
manumission
to
the
who
had
escaped
from
his
house
of
bondage
let
us
now
endeavour
to
estimate
the
validity
of
the
excuses
assigned
and
the
allegations
advanced
by
him
for
the
information
of
governor
sir
patrick
ross
in
this
deliberate
statement
of
his
case
to
allow
the
woman
to
return
home
free
would
he
affirms
be
to
reward
the
worst
species
of
ingratitude
he
assumes
it
seems
the
sovereign
power
of
pronouncing
a
virtual
sentence
of
banishment
for
the
alleged
crime
of
ingratitude
is
this
then
a
power
which
any
man
ought
to
possess
over
his
or
which
any
good
man
would
ever
wish
to
exercise
and
besides
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
beyond
wood
mere
assertion
that
mary
prince
owed
him
or
his
family
the
slightest
mark
of
gratitude
her
account
of
the
treatment
she
received
in
his
service
be
incorrect
but
her
simple
statement
is
at
least
supported
by
minute
and
feasible
details
and
unless
rebutted
by
positive
facts
will
certainly
command
credence
from
impartial
minds
more
readily
than
his
angry
accusation
which
has
something
absurd
and
improbable
in
its
very
front
moreover
is
it
not
absurd
to
term
the
assertion
of
her
by
a
slave
even
supposing
her
to
have
been
kindly
dealt
with
by
her
owners
and
treated
in
every
respect
the
reverse
of
what
mary
affirms
to
have
been
her
treatment
by
wood
and
his
wife
the
species
of
ingratitude
this
may
be
west
indian
ethics
but
it
will
scarcely
be
received
as
sound
doctrine
in
europe
to
permit
her
return
would
be
to
subject
himself
to
insult
whenever
she
came
in
his
way
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
assertion
are
the
laws
of
antigua
then
so
favourable
to
the
free
blacks
or
the
colonial
police
so
feebly
administered
that
there
are
no
sufficient
restraints
to
protect
a
rich
colonist
like
wood
a
man
who
counts
among
his
familiar
friends
the
honourable
byam
and
taylor
the
government
secretary
from
being
insulted
by
a
poor
it
is
preposterous
her
moral
character
is
so
bad
that
she
would
prove
very
troublesome
should
she
come
to
the
colony
without
any
restraint
any
restraint
are
there
no
restraints
supposing
them
necessary
short
of
absolute
slavery
to
keep
troublesome
characters
in
order
but
this
i
suppose
is
the
ad
to
frighten
the
governor
she
is
such
a
termagant
it
seems
that
if
she
once
gets
back
to
the
colony
she
will
not
only
make
it
too
hot
for
poor
wood
but
the
police
and
courts
of
justice
will
scarce
be
a
match
for
her
sir
patrick
ross
no
doubt
will
take
care
how
he
intercedes
farther
for
so
formidable
a
virago
how
can
one
treat
such
arguments
seriously
she
is
not
a
native
of
the
colony
and
he
knows
of
no
relation
she
has
there
true
but
was
it
not
her
home
so
far
as
a
slave
can
have
a
home
for
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
were
not
the
connexions
friendships
and
associations
of
her
mature
life
formed
there
was
it
not
there
she
hoped
to
spend
her
latter
years
in
domestic
tranquillity
with
her
husband
free
from
the
lash
of
the
taskmaster
these
considerations
may
appear
light
to
wood
but
they
are
every
thing
to
this
poor
woman
he
induced
her
he
says
to
take
a
husband
a
short
time
before
she
left
antigua
and
gave
them
a
comfortable
house
in
his
yard
this
paragraph
merits
attention
he
her
to
take
a
if
the
fact
were
true
what
brutality
of
mind
and
manners
does
it
not
indicate
among
these
they
refuse
to
legalize
the
marriages
of
their
slaves
but
them
to
form
such
temporary
connexions
as
may
suit
the
owner
conveniency
just
as
they
would
pair
the
lower
animals
and
this
man
has
the
effrontery
to
tell
us
so
mary
however
tells
a
very
different
story
see
page
and
her
assertion
independently
of
other
proof
is
at
least
as
credible
as
wood
the
reader
will
judge
for
himself
as
to
the
preponderance
of
internal
evidence
in
the
conflicting
statements
he
alleges
that
she
was
before
marriage
licentious
and
even
depraved
in
her
conduct
and
unfaithful
to
her
husband
afterwards
these
are
serious
charges
but
if
true
or
even
partially
true
how
comes
it
that
a
person
so
correct
in
his
family
hours
and
arrangements
as
wood
professes
to
be
and
who
expresses
so
edifying
a
horror
of
licentiousness
could
reconcile
it
to
his
conscience
to
keep
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
so
as
well
as
so
a
character
for
at
least
thirteen
years
and
confide
to
her
for
long
periods
too
the
charge
of
his
house
and
the
care
of
his
children
for
such
i
shall
shew
to
have
been
the
facts
how
can
he
account
for
not
having
rid
himself
with
all
speed
of
so
disreputable
an
inmate
he
who
values
her
loss
so
little
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
how
can
he
account
for
having
sold
other
in
that
period
and
yet
have
retained
this
shocking
woman
nay
even
have
refused
to
sell
her
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
offered
her
full
value
it
could
not
be
from
ignorance
of
her
character
for
the
circumstance
which
he
adduces
as
a
proof
of
her
shameless
depravity
and
which
i
have
omitted
on
account
of
its
indecency
occurred
it
would
appear
not
less
than
years
yet
notwithstanding
her
alleged
ill
qualities
and
habits
of
gross
immorality
he
has
not
only
constantly
refused
to
part
with
her
but
after
thirteen
long
years
brings
her
to
england
as
an
attendant
on
his
wife
and
children
with
the
avowed
intention
of
carrying
her
back
along
with
his
maiden
daughter
a
young
lady
returning
from
school
such
are
the
extraordinary
facts
and
until
wood
shall
reconcile
these
singular
inconsistencies
between
his
actions
and
his
allegations
he
must
not
be
surprised
if
we
in
england
prefer
giving
credit
to
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
although
at
present
it
appears
somewhat
difficult
to
say
which
side
of
the
alternative
is
the
more
creditable
to
his
own
character
her
husband
he
says
has
taken
another
wife
so
that
on
that
score
he
adds
he
does
her
no
injury
supposing
this
fact
be
true
which
i
doubt
as
i
doubt
every
mere
assertion
from
so
questionable
a
quarter
i
shall
take
leave
to
put
a
question
or
two
to
wood
conscience
did
he
not
write
from
england
to
his
friend
darrel
soon
after
mary
left
his
house
directing
him
to
turn
her
husband
daniel
james
off
his
premises
on
account
of
her
offence
telling
him
to
inform
james
at
the
same
time
that
his
wife
had
with
another
man
who
had
robbed
her
of
all
she
had
a
calumny
as
groundless
as
it
was
cruel
i
further
ask
if
the
person
who
invented
this
story
whoever
he
may
be
was
not
likely
enough
to
impose
similar
fabrications
on
the
poor
negro
man
credulity
until
he
may
have
been
induced
to
prove
false
to
his
marriage
vows
and
to
take
another
wife
as
wood
coolly
expresses
it
but
withal
i
strongly
doubt
the
fact
of
daniel
james
infidelity
for
there
is
now
before
me
a
letter
from
himself
to
mary
dated
in
april
couched
in
strong
terms
of
conjugal
affection
expressing
his
anxiety
for
her
speedy
return
and
stating
that
he
had
lately
received
a
grace
a
token
of
religious
advancement
in
the
moravian
church
a
circumstance
altogether
incredible
if
the
man
were
living
in
open
adultery
as
wood
assertion
implies
mary
he
says
endeavoured
to
injure
the
character
of
his
family
by
infamous
falsehoods
which
were
embodied
in
a
petition
to
the
house
of
commons
and
would
have
been
presented
had
not
his
friends
from
antigua
the
hon
byam
and
coull
disproved
her
assertions
i
can
say
something
on
this
point
from
my
own
knowledge
mary
petition
contained
simply
a
brief
statement
of
her
case
and
among
other
things
mentioned
the
treatment
she
had
received
from
and
wood
now
the
principal
facts
are
corroborated
by
other
evidence
and
wood
must
bring
forward
very
different
testimony
from
that
of
coull
before
persons
will
give
credit
to
his
contradiction
the
value
of
that
person
evidence
in
such
cases
will
be
noticed
presently
of
the
hon
byam
i
know
nothing
and
shall
only
at
present
remark
that
it
is
not
likely
to
redound
greatly
to
his
credit
to
appear
in
such
company
furthermore
mary
petition
presented
as
wood
ought
to
know
though
it
was
not
discussed
nor
his
conduct
exposed
as
it
ought
to
have
been
he
speaks
of
the
liability
he
should
incur
under
the
consolidated
slave
law
of
dealing
with
a
free
person
as
a
slave
is
not
this
pretext
hypocritical
in
the
extreme
what
liability
could
he
possibly
incur
by
voluntarily
resigning
the
power
conferred
on
him
by
an
iniquitous
colonial
law
of
the
shackles
of
slavery
on
the
bondwoman
from
whose
limbs
they
had
fallen
when
she
touched
the
free
soil
of
england
there
exists
no
liability
from
which
he
might
not
have
been
easily
secured
or
for
which
he
would
not
have
been
fully
compensated
he
adds
in
a
postscript
that
mary
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
with
her
from
to
at
least
which
she
had
saved
in
his
service
the
fact
is
that
she
had
at
one
time
dollars
in
cash
but
only
a
very
small
portion
of
that
sum
appears
to
have
been
brought
by
her
to
england
the
rest
having
been
partly
advanced
as
she
states
to
assist
her
husband
and
partly
lost
by
being
lodged
in
unfaithful
custody
finally
wood
repeats
twice
that
it
will
afford
him
great
pleasure
to
state
for
the
governor
satisfaction
if
required
such
particulars
of
the
woman
molly
upon
incontestable
evidence
as
he
is
sure
will
acquit
him
in
his
excellency
opinion
of
acting
unkind
or
ungenerous
towards
her
this
is
well
and
i
now
call
upon
wood
to
redeem
his
pledge
to
bring
forward
facts
and
proofs
fully
to
elucidate
the
subject
to
reconcile
if
he
can
the
extraordinary
discrepancies
which
i
have
pointed
out
between
his
assertions
and
the
actual
facts
and
especially
between
his
account
of
mary
prince
character
and
his
own
conduct
in
regard
to
her
he
has
now
to
produce
such
a
statement
as
will
acquit
him
not
only
in
the
opinion
of
sir
patrick
ross
but
of
the
british
public
and
in
this
position
he
has
spontaneously
placed
himself
in
attempting
to
destroy
by
his
deliberate
criminatory
letter
the
poor
woman
fair
fame
and
reputation
an
attempt
but
for
which
the
present
publication
would
probably
never
have
appeared
here
perhaps
we
might
safely
leave
the
case
to
the
judgment
of
the
public
but
as
this
negro
woman
character
not
the
less
valuable
to
her
because
her
condition
is
so
humble
has
been
so
unscrupulously
blackened
by
her
late
master
a
party
so
much
interested
and
inclined
to
place
her
in
the
worst
point
of
view
it
is
incumbent
on
me
as
her
advocate
with
the
public
to
state
such
additional
testimony
in
her
behalf
as
i
can
fairly
and
conscientiously
adduce
my
first
evidence
is
joseph
phillips
of
antigua
having
submitted
to
his
inspection
wood
letter
and
mary
prince
narrative
and
requested
his
candid
and
deliberate
sentiments
in
regard
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
i
have
been
favoured
with
the
following
letter
from
him
on
the
subject
london
january
dear
sir
in
giving
you
my
opinion
of
mary
prince
narrative
and
of
wood
letter
respecting
her
addressed
to
taylor
i
shall
first
mention
my
opportunities
of
forming
a
proper
estimate
of
the
conduct
and
character
of
both
parties
i
have
known
wood
since
his
first
arrival
in
antigua
in
he
was
then
a
poor
young
man
who
had
been
brought
up
as
a
ship
carpenter
in
bermuda
he
was
afterwards
raised
to
be
a
clerk
in
the
commissariat
department
and
realised
sufficient
capital
to
commence
business
as
a
merchant
this
last
profession
he
has
followed
successfully
for
a
good
many
years
and
is
understood
to
have
accumulated
very
considerable
wealth
after
he
entered
into
trade
i
had
constant
intercourse
with
him
in
the
way
of
business
and
in
and
i
was
regularly
employed
on
his
premises
as
his
clerk
consequently
i
had
opportunities
of
seeing
a
good
deal
of
his
character
both
as
a
merchant
and
as
a
master
of
slaves
the
former
topic
i
pass
over
as
irrelevant
to
the
present
subject
in
reference
to
the
latter
i
shall
merely
observe
that
he
was
not
in
regard
to
ordinary
matters
more
severe
than
the
ordinary
run
of
slave
owners
but
if
seriously
offended
he
was
not
of
a
disposition
to
be
easily
appeased
and
would
spare
no
cost
or
sacrifice
to
gratify
his
vindictive
feelings
as
regards
the
exaction
of
work
from
domestic
slaves
his
wife
was
probably
more
severe
than
himself
it
was
almost
impossible
for
the
slaves
ever
to
give
her
entire
satisfaction
of
their
slave
molly
or
mary
i
know
less
than
of
and
wood
but
i
saw
and
heard
enough
of
her
both
while
i
was
constantly
employed
on
wood
premises
and
while
i
was
there
occasionally
on
business
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
was
viewed
by
her
owners
as
their
most
respectable
and
trustworthy
female
slave
it
is
within
my
personal
knowledge
that
she
had
usually
the
charge
of
the
house
in
their
absence
was
entrusted
with
the
keys
and
was
always
considered
by
the
neighbours
and
visitors
as
their
confidential
household
servant
and
as
a
person
in
whose
integrity
they
placed
unlimited
confidence
although
when
wood
was
at
home
she
was
no
doubt
kept
pretty
closely
at
washing
and
other
hard
work
a
decided
proof
of
the
estimation
in
which
she
was
held
by
her
owners
exists
in
the
fact
that
wood
uniformly
refused
to
part
with
her
whereas
he
sold
five
other
slaves
while
she
was
with
them
indeed
she
always
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
slave
of
superior
intelligence
and
respectability
and
i
always
understood
such
to
be
her
general
character
in
the
place
as
to
what
wood
alleges
about
her
being
frequently
before
the
police
i
can
only
say
i
never
heard
of
the
circumstance
before
and
as
i
lived
for
twenty
years
in
the
same
small
town
and
in
the
vicinity
of
their
residence
i
think
i
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
become
acquainted
with
it
had
such
been
the
fact
she
might
however
have
been
occasionally
before
the
magistrate
in
consequence
of
little
disputes
among
the
slaves
without
any
serious
imputation
on
her
general
respectability
she
says
she
was
twice
summoned
to
appear
as
a
witness
on
such
occasions
and
that
she
was
once
sent
by
her
mistress
to
be
confined
in
the
cage
and
was
afterwards
flogged
by
her
desire
this
cruel
practice
is
very
common
in
antigua
and
in
my
opinion
is
but
little
creditable
to
the
slave
owners
and
magistrates
by
whom
such
arbitrary
punishments
are
inflicted
frequently
for
very
trifling
faults
james
scotland
is
the
only
magistrate
in
the
colony
who
invariably
refuses
to
sanction
this
reprehensible
practice
of
the
immoral
conduct
ascribed
to
molly
by
wood
i
can
say
nothing
further
than
this
that
i
have
heard
she
had
at
a
former
period
previous
to
her
marriage
a
connexion
with
a
white
person
a
capt
which
i
have
no
doubt
was
broken
off
when
she
became
seriously
impressed
with
religion
but
at
any
rate
such
connexions
are
so
common
i
might
almost
say
universal
in
our
slave
colonies
that
except
by
the
missionaries
and
a
few
serious
persons
they
are
considered
if
faults
at
all
so
very
venial
as
scarcely
to
deserve
the
name
of
immorality
wood
knows
this
colonial
estimate
of
such
connexions
as
well
as
i
do
and
however
false
such
an
estimate
must
be
allowed
to
be
especially
when
applied
to
their
own
conduct
by
persons
of
education
pretending
to
adhere
to
the
pure
christian
rule
of
morals
yet
when
he
ascribes
to
a
negro
slave
to
whom
legal
marriage
was
denied
such
great
criminality
for
laxity
of
this
sort
and
professes
to
be
so
exceedingly
shocked
and
amazed
at
the
tale
he
himself
relates
he
must
i
am
confident
have
had
a
farther
object
in
view
than
the
information
of
taylor
or
sir
patrick
ross
he
must
it
is
evident
have
been
aware
that
his
letter
would
be
sent
to
allen
and
accordingly
adapted
it
as
more
important
documents
from
the
colonies
are
often
adapted
effect
in
the
tale
of
the
slave
molly
immoralities
be
assured
was
not
intended
for
antigua
so
much
as
for
stoke
newington
and
peckham
and
aldermanbury
in
regard
to
mary
narrative
generally
although
i
can
not
speak
to
the
accuracy
of
the
details
except
in
a
few
recent
particulars
i
can
with
safety
declare
that
i
see
no
reason
to
question
the
truth
of
a
single
fact
stated
by
her
or
even
to
suspect
her
in
any
instance
of
intentional
exaggeration
it
bears
in
my
judgment
the
genuine
stamp
of
truth
and
nature
such
is
my
unhesitating
opinion
after
a
residence
of
years
in
the
west
indies
i
remain
joseph
phillips
pringle
as
wood
refers
to
the
evidence
of
coull
in
opposition
to
mary
assertions
it
may
be
proper
to
enable
you
justly
to
estimate
the
worth
of
that
person
evidence
in
cases
connected
with
the
condition
and
treatment
of
slaves
you
are
aware
that
in
of
glasgow
in
noticing
a
report
of
the
ladies
society
of
birmingham
for
the
relief
of
british
negro
slaves
asserted
with
his
characteristic
audacity
that
the
statement
which
it
contained
respecting
distressed
and
deserted
slaves
in
antigua
was
an
abominable
falsehood
not
contented
with
this
and
with
insinuating
that
i
as
agent
of
the
society
in
the
distribution
of
their
charity
in
antigua
had
fraudulently
duped
them
out
of
their
money
by
a
fabricated
tale
of
distress
proceeded
to
libel
me
in
the
most
opprobrious
terms
as
a
man
of
the
most
worthless
and
abandoned
character
now
i
know
from
good
authority
that
it
was
coull
that
founded
this
impudent
contradiction
of
notorious
facts
and
this
audacious
libel
of
my
personal
character
from
this
single
circumstance
you
may
judge
of
the
value
of
his
evidence
in
the
case
of
mary
prince
i
can
furnish
further
information
respecting
coull
colonial
proceedings
both
private
and
judicial
should
circumstances
require
it
footnote
in
elucidation
of
the
circumstances
above
referred
to
i
subjoin
the
following
extracts
from
the
report
of
the
birmingham
ladies
society
for
as
a
portion
of
the
funds
of
this
association
has
been
appropriated
to
assist
the
benevolent
efforts
of
a
society
which
has
for
fifteen
years
afforded
relief
to
distressed
and
deserted
slaves
in
antigua
it
may
not
be
uninteresting
to
our
friends
to
learn
the
manner
in
which
the
agent
of
this
society
has
been
treated
for
simply
obeying
the
command
of
our
saviour
by
ministering
like
the
good
samaritan
to
the
distresses
of
the
helpless
and
the
desolate
the
society
proceedings
being
adverted
to
by
a
friend
of
africa
at
one
of
the
public
meetings
held
in
this
country
a
west
indian
planter
who
was
present
wrote
over
to
his
friends
in
antigua
and
represented
the
conduct
of
the
distributors
of
this
charity
in
such
a
light
that
it
was
deemed
worthy
of
the
cognizance
of
the
house
of
assembly
joseph
phillips
a
resident
of
the
island
who
had
most
kindly
and
disinterestedly
exerted
himself
in
the
distribution
of
the
money
from
england
among
the
poor
deserted
slaves
was
brought
before
the
assembly
and
most
severely
interrogated
on
his
refusing
to
deliver
up
his
private
correspondence
with
his
friends
in
england
he
was
thrown
into
a
loathsome
jail
where
he
was
kept
for
nearly
five
months
while
his
loss
of
business
and
the
oppressive
proceedings
instituted
against
him
were
involving
him
in
poverty
and
ruin
on
his
discharge
by
the
house
of
assembly
he
was
seized
in
their
lobby
for
debt
and
again
imprisoned
in
our
report
for
the
year
we
quoted
a
passage
from
the
report
of
the
society
for
the
relief
of
deserted
slaves
in
the
island
of
antigua
in
reference
to
a
case
of
great
distress
this
statement
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
editor
of
the
glasgow
courier
of
the
consequences
resulting
from
this
circumstance
we
only
gained
information
through
the
leicester
chronicle
which
had
copied
an
article
from
the
weekly
register
of
antigua
dated
john
september
we
find
from
this
that
affirms
that
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
the
society
is
as
it
deserves
to
be
duped
out
of
its
money
the
whole
tale
of
the
distress
above
referred
to
an
abominable
falsehood
this
statement
which
we
are
informed
has
appeared
in
many
of
the
public
papers
is
completely
refuted
in
our
appendix
no
to
which
we
refer
our
readers
statements
we
regret
to
say
would
lead
many
to
believe
that
there
are
no
deserted
negroes
to
assist
and
that
the
case
mentioned
was
a
perfect
fabrication
he
also
distinctly
avers
that
the
disinterested
and
humane
agent
of
the
society
joseph
phillips
is
man
of
the
most
worthless
and
abandoned
character
in
opposition
to
this
statement
we
learn
the
good
character
of
phillips
from
those
who
have
long
been
acquainted
with
his
laudable
exertions
in
the
cause
of
humanity
and
from
the
editor
of
the
weekly
register
of
antigua
who
speaks
on
his
own
knowledge
of
more
than
twenty
years
back
confidently
appealing
at
the
same
time
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
colony
in
which
he
resides
for
the
truth
of
his
averments

the

upwards

leave
the

candidly
weighed
by
the
reader
in
opposition
to
the
inculpatory
allegations
of

merely
remarking
that
wood
will
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
impugn
the
evidence
of

upright
unimpeached

unexceptionable
character
he

himself
vouched

the
next
testimony
in

is
that
of

a
lady
in
whose
service
she
spent
the
summer
of
see
page
this
lady
on
leaving
london
to
join
her
husband
voluntarily
presented
mary
with
a
certificate
which
though
it
relates
only
to
a
recent
and
short
period
of
her
history
is
a
strong
corroboration
of
the
habitual
respectability
of
her
character
it
is
in
the
following
terms
forsyth
states
that
the
bearer
of
this
paper
mary
james
has
been
with
her
for
the
last
six
months
that
she
has
found
her
an
excellent
character
being
honest
industrious
and
sober
and
that
she
parts
with
her
on
no
other
account
than
this
that
being
obliged
to
travel
with
her
husband
who
has
lately
come
from
abroad
in
bad
health
she
has
no
farther
need
of
a
servant

person
wishing
to
engage
her
can
have
her
character
in
full
from

has
requested
to
furnish
particulars
to
any
one
desiring

keppel
street
sept
in
the
last
place
i
add
my
own
testimony
in
behalf
of
this
negro
woman
independently
of
the
scrutiny
which
as
secretary
of
the
society
i
made
into
her
case
when
she
first
applied
for
assistance
at
aldermanbury
and
the
watchful
eye
i
kept
upon
her
conduct
for
the
ensuing
twelvemonths
while
she
was
the
occasional
pensioner
of
the
society
i
have
now
had
the
opportunity
of
closely
observing
her
conduct
for
fourteen
months
in
the
situation
of
a
domestic
servant
in
my
own
family
and
the
following
is
the
deliberate
opinion
of
mary
character
formed
not
only
by
myself
but
also
by
my
wife
and
after
this
ample
period
of
observation
we
have
found
her
perfectly
honest
and
trustworthy
in
all
respects
so
that
we
have
no
hesitation
in
leaving
every
thing
in
the
house
at
her
disposal
she
had
the
entire
charge
of
the
house
during
our
absence
in
scotland
for
three
months
last
autumn
and
conducted
herself
in
that
charge
with
the
utmost
discretion
and
fidelity
she
is
not
it
is
true
a
very
expert
housemaid
nor
capable
of
much
hard
work
for
her
constitution
appears
to
be
a
good
deal
broken
but
she
is
careful
industrious
and
anxious
to
do
her
duty
and
to
give
satisfaction
she
is
capable
of
strong
attachments
and
feels
deep
though
unobtrusive
gratitude
for
real
kindness
shown
her
she
possesses
considerable
natural
sense
and
has
much
quickness
of
observation
and
discrimination
of
character
she
is
remarkable
for
and
of
conduct
and
her
even
in
trifling
minutiæ
has
been
a
trait
of
special
remark
by
the
females
of
my
family
this
trait
which
is
obviously
quite
unaffected
would
be
a
most
inexplicable
anomaly
if
her
former
habits
had
been
so
indecent
and
depraved
as
wood
alleges
her
chief
faults
so
far
as
we
have
discovered
them
are
a
somewhat
violent
and
hasty
temper
and
a
considerable
share
of
natural
pride
and
but
these
defects
have
been
but
rarely
and
transiently
manifested
and
have
scarcely
occasioned
an
hour
uneasiness
at
any
time
in
our
household
her
religious
knowledge
notwithstanding
the
pious
care
of
her
moravian
instructors
in
antigua
is
still
but
very
limited
and
her
views
of
christianity
indistinct
but
her
profession
whatever
it
may
have
of
imperfection
i
am
convinced
has
nothing
of
insincerity
in
short
we
consider
her
on
the
whole
as
respectable
and
a
person
in
her
station
as
any
domestic
white
or
black
and
we
have
had
ample
experience
of
both
colours
that
we
have
ever
had
in
our
service
but
after
all
mary
character
important
though
its
exculpation
be
to
her
is
not
really
the
point
of
chief
practical
interest
in
this
case
suppose
all
wood
defamatory
allegations
to
be
true
suppose
him
to
be
able
to
rake
up
against
her
out
of
the
records
of
the
antigua
police
or
from
the
veracious
testimony
of
his
brother
colonists
twenty
stories
as
bad
or
worse
than
what
he
insinuates
suppose
the
whole
of
her
own
statement
to
be
false
and
even
the
whole
of
her
conduct
since
she
came
under
our
observation
here
to
be
a
tissue
of
hypocrisy
suppose
all
this
and
leave
the
negro
woman
as
black
in
character
as
in
complexion
yet
it
would
affect
not
the
main
facts
which
are
wood
not
daring
in
england
to
punish
this
woman
arbitrarily
as
he
would
have
done
in
the
west
indies
drove
her
out
of
his
house
or
left
her
at
least
only
the
alternative
of
returning
instantly
to
antigua
with
the
certainty
of
severe
treatment
there
or
submitting
in
silence
to
what
she
considered
intolerable
usage
in
his
household
he
has
since
obstinately
persisted
in
refusing
her
manumission
to
enable
her
to
return
home
in
security
though
repeatedly
offered
more
than
ample
compensation
for
her
value
as
a
slave
and
this
on
various
frivolous
pretexts
but
really
and
indeed
not
unavowedly
in
order
to
her
for
leaving
his
service
in
england
though
he
himself
had
professed
to
give
her
that
option
these
unquestionable
facts
speak
volumes
footnote
if
it
even
were
so
how
strong
a
plea
of
palliation
might
not
the
poor
negro
bring
by
adducing
the
neglect
of
her
various
owners
to
afford
religious
instruction
or
moral
discipline
and
the
habitual
influence
of
their
evil
to
say
the
very
least
before
her
eyes
what
moral
good
could
she
possibly
learn
what
moral
evil
could
she
easily
escape
while
under
the
uncontrolled
power
of
such
masters
as
she
describes
captain
i
and
d
of
turk
island
all
things
considered
it
is
indeed
wonderful
to
find
her
such
as
she
now
is
but
as
she
has
herself
piously
expressed
it
that
god
whom
then
she
knew
not
mercifully
preserved
her
for
better
things
footnote
since
the
preceding
pages
were
printed
off
i
have
been
favoured
with
a
communication
from
the
rev
curtin
to
whom
among
other
acquaintances
of
wood
in
this
country
the
entire
proof
sheets
of
this
pamphlet
had
been
sent
for
inspection
curtin
corrects
some
omissions
and
inaccuracies
in
mary
prince
narrative
see
page
by
stating
that
she
was
baptized
not
in
august
but
on
the
of
april
that
sometime
before
her
baptism
on
her
being
admitted
a
catechumen
preparatory
to
that
holy
ordinance
she
brought
a
note
from
her
owner
wood
recommending
her
for
religious
instruction
that
it
was
his
usual
practice
when
any
adult
slaves
came
on
to
school
to
require
their
owners
permission
for
their
attendance
but
that
on
the
chapel
was
open
indiscriminately
to
mary
after
a
personal
interview
with
curtin
and
after
hearing
his
letter
read
by
me
still
maintains
that
wood
note
recommended
her
for
baptism
merely
and
that
she
never
received
any
religious
instruction
whatever
from
and
wood
or
from
any
one
else
at
that
period
beyond
what
she
has
stated
in
her
narrative
in
regard
to
her
to
the
sunday
school
without
permission
from
her
owners
she
admits
that
she
may
possibly
have
mistaken
the
clergyman
meaning
on
that
point
but
says
that
such
was
certainly
her
impression
at
the
time
and
the
actual
cause
of
her
curtin
finds
in
his
books
some
reference
to
mary
connection
with
a
captain
the
individual
i
believe
alluded
to
by
phillips
at
page
but
he
states
that
when
she
attended
his
chapel
she
was
always
decently
and
becomingly
dressed
and
appeared
to
him
to
be
in
a
situation
of
trust
in
her
mistress
family
curtin
offers
no
comment
on
any
other
part
of
mary
statement
but
he
speaks
in
very
favourable
though
general
terms
of
the
respectability
of
wood
whom
he
had
known
for
many
years
in
antigua
and
of
wood
though
she
was
not
personally
known
to
him
he
says
that
he
had
heard
her
spoken
of
by
those
of
her
acquaintance
as
a
lady
of
very
mild
and
amiable
manners
another
friend
of
and
wood
a
lady
who
had
been
their
guest
both
in
antigua
and
england
alleges
that
mary
has
grossly
misrepresented
them
in
her
narrative
and
says
that
she
can
vouch
for
their
being
the
most
benevolent
people
that
can
possibly
live
she
has
declined
however
to
furnish
me
with
any
written
correction
of
the
misrepresentations
she
complains
of
although
i
offered
to
insert
her
testimony
in
behalf
of
her
friends
if
sent
to
me
in
time
and
having
already
kept
back
the
publication
a
fortnight
waiting
for
communications
of
this
sort
i
will
not
delay
it
longer
those
who
have
withheld
their
strictures
have
only
themselves
to
blame
of
the
general
character
of
and
wood
i
would
not
designedly
give
any
impression
without
implicitly
adopting
either
the
view
of
mary
prince
or
the
unmeasured
encomiums
of
their
friends
i
am
willing
to
believe
them
to
be
on
the
whole
fair
perhaps
favourable
specimens
of
colonial
character
let
them
even
be
rated
if
you
will
in
the
very
highest
and
most
benevolent
class
of
and
laying
everything
else
entirely
out
of
view
let
wood
conduct
in
this
affair
be
tried
exclusively
by
the
facts
established
beyond
dispute
and
by
his
own
statement
of
the
case
in
his
letter
to
taylor
but
then
i
ask
if
the
very
and
of
your
can
act
as
wood
is
proved
to
have
acted
what
is
to
be
expected
of
persons
whose
mildness
or
equity
or
common
humanity
no
one
will
dare
to
vouch
for
if
such
things
are
done
in
the
green
tree
what
will
be
done
in
the
dry
and
what
else
then
can
colonial
slavery
possibly
be
even
in
its
best
estate
but
a
system
incurably
evil
and
iniquitous
i
require
no
other
data
i
need
add
no
further
comment
the
case
affords
a
most
instructive
illustration
of
the
true
spirit
of
the
slave
system
and
of
the
pretensions
of
the
to
assert
not
merely
their
claims
to
a
vested
right
in
the
of
their
bondmen
but
to
an
indefeasible
property
in
them
as
their
absolute
chattels
it
furnishes
a
striking
practical
comment
on
the
assertions
of
the
west
indians
that
is
a
sufficient
check
to
the
indulgence
of
vindictive
feelings
in
the
master
for
here
is
a
case
where
a
man
a
and
man
as
his
friends
aver
prefers
losing
entirely
the
full
price
of
the
slave
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
preventing
a
poor
black
woman
from
returning
home
to
her
husband
if
the
pleasure
of
thwarting
the
benevolent
wishes
of
the
society
in
behalf
of
the
deserted
negro
be
an
additional
motive
with
wood
it
will
not
much
mend
his
wretched
plea
i
may
here
add
a
few
words
respecting
the
earlier
portion
of
mary
narrative
the
facts
there
stated
must
necessarily
rest
entirely
since
we
have
no
collateral
evidence
upon
their
intrinsic
claims
to
probability
and
upon
the
reliance
the
reader
may
feel
disposed
after
perusing
the
foregoing
pages
to
place
on
her
veracity
to
my
judgment
the
internal
evidence
of
the
truth
of
her
narrative
appears
remarkably
strong
the
circumstances
are
related
in
a
tone
of
natural
sincerity
and
are
accompanied
in
almost
every
case
with
characteristic
and
minute
details
which
must
i
conceive
carry
with
them
full
conviction
to
every
candid
mind
that
this
negro
woman
has
actually
seen
felt
and
suffered
all
that
she
so
impressively
describes
and
that
the
picture
she
has
given
of
west
indian
slavery
is
not
less
true
than
it
is
revolting
but
there
may
be
some
persons
into
whose
hands
this
tract
may
fall
so
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
real
character
of
negro
slavery
as
to
be
shocked
into
partial
if
not
absolute
incredulity
by
the
acts
of
inhuman
oppression
and
brutality
related
of
capt
i
and
his
wife
and
of
d
the
salt
manufacturer
of
turk
island
here
at
least
such
persons
may
be
disposed
to
think
there
surely
must
be
exaggeration
the
facts
are
too
shocking
to
be
credible
the
facts
are
indeed
shocking
but
unhappily
not
the
less
credible
on
that
account
slavery
is
a
curse
to
the
oppressor
scarcely
less
than
to
the
oppressed
its
natural
tendency
is
to
brutalize
both
after
a
residence
myself
of
six
years
in
a
slave
colony
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
whether
as
regards
its
influence
the
master
is
not
even
a
greater
object
of
compassion
than
his
bondman
let
those
who
are
disposed
to
doubt
the
atrocities
related
in
this
narrative
on
the
testimony
of
a
sufferer
examine
the
details
of
many
cases
of
similar
barbarity
that
have
lately
come
before
the
public
on
unquestionable
evidence
passing
over
the
reports
of
the
fiscal
of
berbice
and
the
mauritius
horrors
recently
unveiled
let
them
consider
the
case
of
and
moss
of
the
bahamas
and
their
slave
kate
so
justly
denounced
by
the
secretary
for
the
colonies
the
cases
of
eleanor
mead
of
henry
williams
and
of
the
rev
bridges
and
kitty
hylton
in
jamaica
these
cases
alone
might
suffice
to
demonstrate
the
inevitable
tendency
of
slavery
as
it
exists
in
our
colonies
to
brutalize
the
master
to
a
truly
frightful
degree
a
degree
which
would
often
cast
into
the
shade
even
the
atrocities
related
in
the
narrative
of
mary
prince
and
which
are
sufficient
to
prove
independently
of
all
other
evidence
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
revolting
character
of
the
facts
to
affect
their
credibility
but
that
on
the
contrary
similar
deeds
are
at
this
very
time
of
frequent
occurrence
in
almost
every
one
of
our
slave
colonies
the
system
of
coercive
labour
may
vary
in
different
places
it
may
be
more
destructive
to
human
life
in
the
cane
culture
of
mauritius
and
jamaica
than
in
the
predial
and
domestic
bondage
of
bermuda
or
the
bahamas
but
the
spirit
and
character
of
slavery
are
every
where
the
same
and
can
not
fail
to
produce
similar
effects
wherever
slavery
prevails
there
will
inevitably
be
found
cruelty
and
oppression
individuals
who
have
preserved
humane
and
amiable
and
tolerant
dispositions
towards
their
black
dependents
may
doubtless
be
found
among
but
even
where
a
happy
instance
of
this
sort
occurs
such
as
mary
first
mistress
the
williams
the
favoured
condition
of
the
slave
is
still
as
precarious
as
it
is
rare
it
is
every
moment
at
the
mercy
of
events
and
must
always
be
held
by
a
tenure
so
proverbially
uncertain
as
that
of
human
prosperity
or
human
life
such
examples
like
a
feeble
and
flickering
streak
of
light
in
a
gloomy
picture
only
serve
by
contrast
to
exhibit
the
depth
of
the
prevailing
shades
like
other
exceptions
they
only
prove
the
general
rule
the
unquestionable
tendency
of
the
system
is
to
vitiate
the
best
tempers
and
to
harden
the
most
feeling
hearts
never
be
kind
nor
speak
kindly
to
a
slave
said
an
accomplished
english
lady
in
south
africa
to
my
wife
i
have
now
she
added

for
some
time
a
and
have
found
from
vexatious
experience
in
my
own
household
that
nothing
but
harshness
and
hauteur
will
do
with
slaves

and
i
might
perhaps
not
inappropriately
illustrate
this
point
more
fully
by
stating
many
cases
which
fell
under
my
own
personal
observation
or
became
known
to
me
through
authentic
sources
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
a
colony
where
slavery
assumes
as
it
is
averred
a
milder
aspect
than
in
any
other
dependency
of
the
empire
where
it
exists
and
i
could
shew
from
the
judicial
records
of
that
colony
received
by
me
within
these
few
weeks
cases
scarcely
inferior
in
barbarity
to
the
worst
of
those
to
which
i
have
just
specially
referred
but
to
do
so
would
lead
me
too
far
from
the
immediate
purpose
of
this
pamphlet
and
extend
it
to
an
inconvenient
length
i
shall
therefore
content
myself
with
quoting
a
single
short
passage
from
the
excellent
work
of
my
friend
walsh
entitled
notices
of
brazil
a
work
which
besides
its
other
merits
has
vividly
illustrated
the
true
spirit
of
negro
slavery
as
it
displays
itself
not
merely
in
that
country
but
wherever
it
has
been
permitted
to
open
its
pandora
box
of
misery
and
crime
let
the
reader
ponder
on
the
following
just
remarks
and
compare
the
facts
stated
by
the
author
in
illustration
of
them
with
the
circumstances
related
at
pages
and
of
mary
narrative
if
then
we
put
out
of
the
question
the
injury
inflicted
on
others
and
merely
consider
the
deterioration
of
feeling
and
principle
with
which
it
operates
on
ourselves
ought
it
not
to
be
a
sufficient
and
indeed
unanswerable
argument
against
the
permission
of
slavery
the
exemplary
manner
in
which
the
paternal
duties
are
performed
at
home
may
mark
people
as
the
most
fond
and
affectionate
parents
but
let
them
once
go
abroad
and
come
within
the
contagion
of
slavery
and
it
seems
to
alter
the
very
nature
of
a
man
and
the
father
has
sold
and
still
sells
the
mother
and
his
children
with
as
little
compunction
as
he
would
a
sow
and
her
litter
of
pigs
and
he
often
disposes
of
them
together
this
deterioration
of
feeling
is
conspicuous
in
many
ways
among
the
brazilians
they
are
naturally
a
people
of
a
humane
and
disposition
and
much
indisposed
to
cruelty
or
severity
of
any
kind
indeed
the
manner
in
which
many
of
them
treat
their
slaves
is
a
proof
of
this
as
it
is
really
gentle
and
considerate
but
the
natural
tendency
to
cruelty
and
oppression
in
the
human
heart
is
continually
evolved
by
the
impunity
and
uncontrolled
licence
in
which
they
are
exercised
i
never
walked
through
the
streets
of
rio
that
some
house
did
not
present
to
me
the
semblance
of
a
bridewell
where
the
moans
and
the
cries
of
the
sufferers
and
the
sounds
of
whips
and
scourges
within
announced
to
me
that
corporal
punishment
was
being
inflicted
whenever
i
remarked
this
to
a
friend
i
was
always
answered
that
the
refractory
nature
of
the
slave
rendered
it
necessary
and
no
house
could
properly
be
conducted
unless
it
was
practised
but
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
and
the
chastisement
is
constantly
applied
in
the
very
wantonness
of
barbarity
and
would
not
and
dared
not
be
inflicted
on
the
humblest
wretch
in
society
if
he
was
not
a
slave
and
so
put
out
of
the
pale
of
pity
immediately
joining
our
house
was
one
occupied
by
a
mechanic
from
which
the
most
dismal
cries
and
moans
constantly
proceeded
i
entered
the
shop
one
day
and
found
it
was
occupied
by
a
saddler
who
had
two
negro
boys
working
at
his
business
he
was
a
tawny
man
with
a
dark
aspect
and
he
had
cut
from
his
leather
a
scourge
like
a
russian
knout
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
was
in
the
act
of
exercising
on
one
of
the
naked
children
in
an
inner
room
and
this
was
the
cause
of
the
moans
and
cries
we
heard
every
day
and
almost
all
day
long
in
the
rear
of
our
house
was
another
occupied
by
some
women
of
bad
character
who
kept
as
usual
several
negro
slaves
i
was
awoke
early
one
morning
by
dismal
cries
and
looking
out
of
the
window
i
saw
in
the
back
yard
of
the
house
a
black
girl
of
about
fourteen
years
old
before
her
stood
her
mistress
a
white
woman
with
a
large
stick
in
her
hand
she
was
undressed
except
her
petticoat
and
chemise
which
had
fallen
down
and
left
her
shoulders
and
bosom
bare
her
hair
was
streaming
behind
and
every
fierce
and
malevolent
passion
was
depicted
in
her
face
she
too
like
my
hostess
at
governo
another
striking
illustration
of
the
effects
of
slavery
was
the
very
representation
of
a
fury
she
was
striking
the
poor
girl
whom
she
had
driven
up
into
a
corner
where
she
was
on
her
knees
appealing
for
mercy
she
shewed
her
none
but
continued
to
strike
her
on
the
head
and
thrust
the
stick
into
her
face
till
she
was
herself
exhausted
and
her
poor
victim
covered
with
blood
this
scene
was
renewed
every
morning
and
the
cries
and
moans
of
the
poor
suffering
blacks
announced
that
they
were
enduring
the
penalty
of
slavery
in
being
the
objects
on
which
the
irritable
and
malevolent
passions
of
the
whites
are
allowed
to
vent
themselves
with
impunity
nor
could
i
help
deeply
deploring
that
state
of
society
in
which
the
vilest
characters
in
the
community
are
allowed
an
almost
uncontrolled
power
of
life
and
death
over
their
innocent
and
far
more
estimable
notices
of
brazil
vol
ii
p
in
conclusion
i
may
observe
that
the
history
of
mary
prince
furnishes
a
corollary
to
lord
stowell
decision
in
the
case
of
the
slave
grace
and
that
it
is
most
valuable
on
this
account
whatever
opinions
may
be
held
by
some
readers
on
the
grave
question
of
immediately
abolishing
colonial
slavery
nothing
assuredly
can
be
more
repugnant
to
the
feelings
of
englishmen
than
that
the
system
should
be
permitted
to
extend
its
baneful
influence
to
this
country
yet
such
is
the
case
when
the
slave
landed
in
england
still
only
possesses
that
qualified
degree
of
freedom
that
a
change
of
domicile
will
determine
it
though
born
a
british
subject
and
resident
within
the
shores
of
england
he
is
cut
off
from
his
dearest
natural
rights
by
the
sad
alternative
of
regaining
them
at
the
expence
of
liberty
and
the
certainty
of
severe
treatment
it
is
true
that
he
has
the
option
of
returning
but
it
is
a
cruel
mockery
to
call
it
a
voluntary
choice
when
upon
his
return
depend
his
means
of
subsistence
and
his
with
all
that
makes
life
valuable
here
he
has
tasted
the
sweets
of
freedom
to
quote
the
words
of
the
unfortunate
mary
prince
but
if
he
desires
to
restore
himself
to
his
family
or
to
escape
from
suffering
and
destitution
and
the
other
evils
of
a
climate
uncongenial
to
his
constitution
and
habits
he
must
abandon
the
enjoyment
of
his
liberty
and
again
subject
himself
to
the
arbitrary
power
of
a
vindictive
master
the
case
of
mary
prince
is
by
no
means
a
singular
one
many
of
the
same
kind
are
daily
occurring
and
even
if
the
case
were
singular
it
would
still
loudly
call
for
the
interference
of
the
legislature
in
instances
of
this
kind
no
injury
can
possibly
be
done
to
the
owner
by
confirming
to
the
slave
his
resumption
of
his
natural
rights
it
is
the
master
spontaneous
act
to
bring
him
to
this
country
he
knows
when
he
brings
him
that
he
divests
himself
of
his
property
and
it
is
in
fact
a
minor
species
of
slave
trading
when
he
has
thus
enfranchised
his
slave
to
that
slave
by
the
necessities
of
his
condition
or
by
working
upon
the
better
feelings
of
his
heart
abstractedly
from
all
legal
technicalities
there
is
no
real
difference
between
thus
compelling
the
return
of
the
enfranchised
negro
and
trepanning
a
free
native
of
england
by
delusive
hopes
into
perpetual
slavery
the
most
ingenious
casuist
could
not
point
out
any
essential
distinction
between
the
two
cases
our
boasted
liberty
is
the
dream
of
imagination
and
no
longer
the
characteristic
of
our
country
if
its
bulwarks
can
thus
be
thrown
down
by
colonial
special
pleading
it
would
well
become
the
character
of
the
present
government
to
introduce
a
bill
into
the
legislature
making
perpetual
that
freedom
which
the
slave
has
acquired
by
his
passage
here
and
thus
to
declare
in
the
most
ample
sense
of
the
words
what
indeed
we
had
long
fondly
believed
to
be
the
fact
though
it
now
appears
that
we
have
been
mistaken
that
no
slave
can
exist
within
the
shores
of
great
britain
narrative
of
louis
a
captured
african
the
following
interesting
narrative
is
a
convenient
supplement
to
the
history
of
mary
prince
it
is
given
like
hers
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
narrator
words
with
only
so
much
correction
as
was
necessary
to
connect
the
story
and
render
it
grammatical
the
concluding
passage
in
inverted
commas
is
entirely
his
own
while
mary
narrative
shews
the
disgusting
character
of
colonial
slavery
this
little
tale
explains
with
equal
force
the
horrors
in
which
it
originates
it
is
necessary
to
explain
that
louis
came
to
this
country
about
five
years
ago
in
a
french
vessel
called
the
pearl
she
had
lost
her
reckoning
and
was
driven
by
stress
of
weather
into
the
port
of
ives
in
cornwall
louis
and
his
four
companions
were
brought
to
london
upon
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
the
instance
of
george
stephen
and
after
some
trifling
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
master
of
the
vessel
were
discharged
by
lord
wynford
two
of
his
unfortunate
died
of
the
measles
at
hampstead
the
other
two
returned
to
sierra
leone
but
poor
louis
when
offered
the
choice
of
going
back
to
africa
replied
me
no
father
no
mother
now
me
stay
with
you
and
here
he
has
ever
since
remained
conducting
himself
in
a
way
to
gain
the
good
will
and
respect
of
all
who
know
him
he
is
remarkably
intelligent
understands
our
language
perfectly
and
can
read
and
write
well
the
last
sentences
of
the
following
narrative
will
seem
almost
too
peculiar
to
be
his
own
but
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
in
conversation
with
george
stephen
he
has
made
similar
remarks
on
one
occasion
in
particular
he
was
heard
saying
to
himself
in
the
kitchen
while
sitting
by
the
fire
apparently
in
deep
thought
me
think
me
think
a
inquired
what
he
meant
and
he
added
me
think
what
a
good
thing
i
came
to
england
here
i
know
what
god
is
and
read
my
bible
in
my
country
they
have
no
god
no
bible
how
severe
and
just
a
reproof
to
the
guilty
wretches
who
visit
his
country
only
with
fire
and
sword
how
deserved
a
censure
upon
the
not
less
guilty
men
who
dare
to
vindicate
the
state
of
slavery
on
the
lying
pretext
that
its
victims
are
of
an
inferior
nature
and
scarcely
less
deserving
of
reprobation
are
those
who
have
it
in
their
power
to
prevent
these
crimes
but
who
remain
inactive
from
indifference
or
are
dissuaded
from
throwing
the
shield
of
british
power
over
the
victim
of
oppression
by
the
sophistry
and
the
clamour
and
the
avarice
of
the
oppressor
it
is
the
reproach
and
the
sin
of
england
may
god
avert
from
our
country
the
ruin
which
this
national
guilt
deserves
we
lament
to
add
that
the
pearl
which
brought
these
negroes
to
our
shore
was
restored
to
its
owners
at
the
instance
of
the
french
government
instead
of
being
condemned
as
a
prize
to
lieut
rye
who
on
his
own
responsibility
detained
her
with
all
her
manacles
and
chains
and
other
detestable
proofs
of
her
piratical
occupation
on
board
we
trust
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
demand
investigation
into
the
reasons
for
restoring
her
negro
boy
my
father
name
was
clashoquin
mine
is
he
lived
in
a
country
called
bycla
near
egie
a
large
town
egie
is
as
large
as
brighton
it
was
some
way
from
the
sea
i
had
five
brothers
and
sisters
we
all
lived
together
with
my
father
and
mother
he
kept
a
horse
and
was
respectable
but
not
one
of
the
great
men
my
uncle
was
one
of
the
great
men
at
egie
he
could
make
men
come
and
work
for
him
his
name
was
otou
he
had
a
great
deal
of
land
and
cattle
my
father
sometimes
worked
on
his
own
land
and
used
to
make
charcoal
i
was
too
little
to
work
my
eldest
brother
used
to
work
on
the
land
and
we
were
all
very
happy
a
great
many
people
whom
we
called
adinyés
set
fire
to
egie
in
the
morning
before
daybreak
there
were
some
thousands
of
them
they
killed
a
great
many
and
burnt
all
their
houses
they
staid
two
days
and
then
carried
away
all
the
people
whom
they
did
not
kill
they
came
again
every
now
and
then
for
a
month
as
long
as
they
could
find
people
to
carry
away
they
used
to
tie
them
by
the
feet
except
when
they
were
taking
them
off
and
then
they
let
them
loose
but
if
they
offered
to
run
away
they
would
shoot
them
i
lost
a
great
many
friends
and
relations
at
egie
about
a
dozen
they
sold
all
they
carried
away
to
be
slaves
i
know
this
because
i
afterwards
saw
them
as
slaves
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
they
took
away
brothers
and
sisters
and
husbands
and
wives
they
did
not
care
about
this
they
were
sold
for
cloth
or
gunpowder
sometimes
for
salt
or
guns
sometimes
they
got
four
or
five
guns
for
a
man
they
were
english
guns
made
like
my
master
that
i
clean
for
his
shooting
the
adinyés
burnt
a
great
many
places
besides
egie
they
burnt
all
the
country
wherever
they
found
villages
they
used
to
shoot
men
women
and
children
if
they
ran
away
they
came
to
us
about
eleven
one
day
and
directly
they
came
they
set
our
house
on
fire
all
of
us
had
run
away
we
kept
together
and
went
into
the
woods
and
stopped
there
two
days
the
adinyés
then
went
away
and
we
returned
home
and
found
every
thing
burnt
we
tried
to
build
a
little
shed
and
were
beginning
to
get
comfortable
again
we
found
several
of
our
neighbours
lying
about
wounded
they
had
been
shot
i
saw
the
bodies
of
four
or
five
little
children
whom
they
had
killed
with
blows
on
the
head
they
had
carried
away
their
fathers
and
mothers
but
the
children
were
too
small
for
slaves
so
they
killed
them
they
had
killed
several
others
but
these
were
all
that
i
saw
i
saw
them
lying
in
the
street
like
dead
dogs
in
about
a
week
after
we
got
back
the
adinyés
returned
and
burnt
all
the
sheds
and
houses
they
had
left
standing
we
all
ran
away
again
we
went
to
the
woods
as
we
had
done
they
followed
us
the
next
day
we
went
farther
into
the
woods
and
staid
there
about
four
days
and
nights
we
were
half
starved
we
only
got
a
few
potatoes
my
uncle
otou
was
with
us
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
adinyés
found
us
we
ran
away
they
called
my
uncle
to
go
to
them
but
he
refused
and
they
shot
him
immediately
they
killed
him
the
rest
of
us
ran
on
and
they
did
not
get
at
us
till
the
next
day
i
ran
up
into
a
tree
they
followed
me
and
brought
me
down
they
tied
my
feet
i
do
not
know
if
they
found
my
father
and
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
they
had
run
faster
than
me
and
were
half
a
mile
farther
when
i
got
up
into
the
tree
i
have
never
seen
them
there
was
a
man
who
ran
up
into
the
tree
with
me
i
believe
they
shot
him
for
i
never
saw
him
again
they
carried
away
about
twenty
besides
me
they
carried
us
to
the
sea
they
did
not
beat
us
they
only
killed
one
man
who
was
very
ill
and
too
weak
to
carry
his
load
they
made
all
of
us
carry
chickens
and
meat
for
our
food
but
this
poor
man
could
not
carry
his
load
and
they
ran
him
through
the
body
with
a
he
was
a
neighbour
of
ours
when
we
got
to
the
sea
they
sold
all
of
us
but
not
to
the
same
person
they
sold
us
for
money
and
i
was
sold
six
times
over
sometimes
for
money
sometimes
for
cloth
and
sometimes
for
a
gun
i
was
about
thirteen
years
old
it
was
about
half
a
year
from
the
time
i
was
taken
before
i
saw
the
white
people
we
were
taken
in
a
boat
from
place
to
place
and
sold
at
every
place
we
stopped
at
in
about
six
months
we
got
to
a
ship
in
which
we
first
saw
white
people
they
were
french
they
bought
us
we
found
here
a
great
many
other
slaves
there
were
about
eighty
including
women
and
children
the
frenchmen
sent
away
all
but
five
of
us
into
another
very
large
ship
we
five
staid
on
board
till
we
got
to
england
which
was
about
five
or
six
months
the
slaves
we
saw
on
board
the
ship
were
chained
together
by
the
legs
below
deck
so
close
they
could
not
move
they
were
flogged
very
cruelly
i
saw
one
of
them
flogged
till
he
died
we
could
not
tell
what
for
they
gave
them
enough
to
eat
the
place
they
were
confined
in
below
deck
was
so
hot
and
nasty
i
could
not
bear
to
be
in
it
a
great
many
of
the
slaves
were
ill
but
they
were
not
attended
to
they
used
to
flog
me
very
bad
on
board
the
ship
the
captain
cut
my
head
very
bad
one
time
i
am
very
happy
to
be
in
england
as
far
as
i
am
very
well
but
i
have
no
friend
belonging
to
me
but
god
who
will
take
care
of
me
as
he
has
done
already
i
am
very
glad
i
have
come
to
england
to
know
who
god
is
i
should
like
much
to
see
my
friends
again
but
i
do
not
now
wish
to
go
back
to
them
for
if
i
go
back
to
my
own
country
i
might
be
taken
as
a
slave
again
i
would
rather
stay
here
where
i
am
free
than
go
back
to
my
country
to
be
sold
i
shall
stay
in
england
as
long
as
please
god
i
shall
live
i
wish
the
king
of
england
could
know
all
i
have
told
you
i
wish
it
that
he
may
see
how
cruelly
we
are
used
we
had
no
king
in
our
country
or
he
would
have
stopt
it
i
think
the
king
of
england
might
stop
it
and
this
is
why
i
wish
him
to
know
it
all
i
have
heard
say
he
is
good
and
if
he
is
he
will
stop
it
if
he
can
i
am
well
off
myself
for
i
am
well
taken
care
of
and
have
good
bed
and
good
clothes
but
i
wish
my
own
people
to
be
as
comfortable
