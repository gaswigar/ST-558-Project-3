extensive

who

that

from
the
swift
completion
of
their
handsomely
appointed
rondos
on

with

permissible
error
of
a
millionth
of

in

of

robot
postal
station
black
sorter
gulped
down
ten
thousand
pieces
of
mail
this
breakfast
tidbit
did
not
agree
with
the
machine
it
was
as
if
a
robust
dog
had
been
fed
a
large
chunk
of
good
red
meat
with
a
strychnine
pill
in
it
black
sorter
innards
went
a
blue
electric
glow
enveloped
him
and
he
began
to
shake
as
if
he
might
break
loose
from
the
concrete
he
desperately
spat
back
over
his
shoulder
a
single
envelope
gave
a
great
and
blew
out
toward
the
sorting
tubes
a
snowstorm
consisting
of
the
other
nine
thousand
nine
hundred
and
pieces
of
mail
chewed
to
confetti
then
still
convulsed
he
snapped
up
a
fresh
ten
thousand
and
proceeded
to
chomp
and
grind
on
them
black
sorter
was
rugged
the
rejected
envelope
was
tongued
up
by
red
subsorter
who
growled
deep
in
his
throat
said
a
very
bad
word
and
passed
it
to
yellow
rerouter
who
passed
it
to
green
rerouter
who
passed
it
to
brown
study
who
passed
it
to
pink
wastebasket
unlike
black
sorter
pink
wastebasket
was
very
delicate
though
highly
intuitive
the
machine
equivalent
of
a
white
russian
countess
she
was
designed
to
scan
in
codes
route
spacemail
to
interplanetary
liners
by
messenger
rocket
and
distinguish
from
pink
wastebasket
haughtily
inhaled
the
offending
envelope
and
almost
instantly
turned
a
bright
crimson
and
began
to
tremble
after
a
few
minutes
small
atomic
flames
started
to
flicker
from
her
white
nursemaid
seven
and
greasy
joe
both
received
pink
distress
signal
and
got
there
as
fast
as
their
wheels
would
roll
them
but
the
machine
malady
was
beyond
their
simple
skills
of
oilcan
and
electroshock
they
summoned
other
machines
ones
far
more
expert
than
themselves
but
all
were
baffled
it
was
clear
that
pink
wastebasket
who
continued
to
tremble
and
flicker
uncontrollably
was
suffering
from
the
equivalent
of
a
major
psychosis
with
severe
psychosomatic
symptoms
she
spat
a
stream
of
filthy
ions
at
gray
psychiatrist
not
recognizing
her
old
friend
meanwhile
the
paper
blizzard
from
black
sorter
was
piling
up
in
great
drifts
between
the
dark
pillars
of
the
sublevel
and
flurries
had
reached
pink
wastebasket
aristocratic
area
an
expedition
of
sturdy
machines
headed
by
two
hastily
summoned
snowplows
was
dispatched
to
immobilize
black
sorter
at
all
costs
pink
wastebasket
quivering
like
a
demented
hula
dancer
was
clearly
approaching
a
crisis
finally
gray
psychiatrist
after
consulting
with
green
surgeon
and
even
then
with
an
irritated
reluctance
as
if
he
were
calling
in
a
summoned
a
human
being
the
human
being
walked
respectfully
around
pink
wastebasket
several
times
and
then
gave
her
a
nervous
little
poke
with
a
probe
pink
wastebasket
gently
regurgitated
her
last
snack
turned
dead
white
gave
a
last
flicker
and
shake
and
expired
black
coroner
recorded
the
immediate
cause
of
death
as
tinkering
by
a
human
being
the
human
being
a
bald
and
scrawny
one
named
potshelter
picked
up
the
envelope
responsible
for
all
the
trouble
stared
at
it
incredulously
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
scanned
the
contents
briefly
gave
a
great
shriek
and
ran
off
at
top
speed
forgetting
to
hop
on
his
perambulator
which
followed
him
making
anxious
clucking
noises
the
nearest
human
representative
of
the
solar
bureau
of
investigation
a
rather
man
named
krumbine
also
bald
recognized
potshelter
as
soon
as
the
latter
burst
gasping
into
his
office
squeezing
through
the
door
while
it
was
still
dilating
the
human
beings
whose
work
took
them
among
the
top
brass
as
the
machines
were
sometimes
referred
to
formed
a
kind
of
human
elite
just
one
big
nervous
family
sit
down
potshelter
the
sbi
man
said
hold
still
a
second
so
the
chair
can
grab
you
hitch
onto
the
hookah
and
choose
a
tranquilizer
from
the
tray
at
your
elbow
whatever
deviation
you
uncovered
be
that
much
of
a
danger
to
the
planets
i
imagine
that
when
you
leave
this
office
the
solar
battle
fleet
will
still
be
orbiting
peacefully
around
luna
i
seriously
doubt
that
potshelter
gulped
a
large
lavender
pill
and
took
a
deep
breath
krumbine
a
letter
turned
up
in
the
mail
this
morning
great
scott
it
is
a
letter
from
one
person
to
another
person
good
lord
the
flow
of
advertising
has
been
seriously
interfered
with
at
a
modest
estimate
three
hundred
million
pieces
of
expensive
advertising
have
already
been
chewed
to
rags
and
i
not
sure
the
steel
helms
god
bless
have
the
trouble
in
hand
yet
judas
priest
naturally
the
poor
machines
were
able
to
cope
with
the
letter
it
was
utterly
outside
their
experience
beyond
the
furthest
reach
of
their
programming
it
threw
them
into
a
terrible
spasm
pink
wastebasket
is
dead
and
at
this
very
instant
if
we
lucky
three
police
machines
of
the
toughest
blued
steel
are
holding
down
black
sorter
and
putting
a
muzzle
on
him
great
scott
it
incredible
potshelter
and
pink
wastebasket
dead
take
another
tranquilizer
potshelter
and
hand
over
the
tray
krumbine
received
it
with
trembling
fingers
started
to
pick
up
a
big
pink
pill
but
drew
back
his
hand
from
it
in
sudden
revulsion
at
its
color
and
swallowed
two
blue
oval
ones
instead
the
man
was
obviously
fighting
to
control
himself
he
said
unsteadily
i
almost
never
take
doubles
but
this
news
you
bring
good
lord
i
seem
to
recall
a
case
where
someone
tried
to
send
a
through
the
mails
but
that
was
before
my
time
incidentally
is
there
any
possibility
that
this
is
a
letter
sent
by
one
of
persons
to
another
group
a
hive
or
a
therapy
group
or
a
social
club
that
would
be
bad
enough
of
course
but
no
just
one
single
person
sending
to
another
expression
set
in
grimly
solicitous
lines
i
can
see
you
do
quite
understand
krumbine
this
is
not
a
but
a
letter
written
in
letters
you
know
letters
characters
like
books
do
mention
books
in
this
office
krumbine
drew
himself
up
angrily
and
then
slumped
back
excuse
me
potshelter
but
i
find
this
very
difficult
to
face
squarely
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
one
person
has
tried
to
use
the
mails
to
send
a
printed
sheet
of
some
sort
to
another
worse
than
that
a
written
letter
written
i
do
recognize
the
word
it
a
way
of
making
characters
of
forming
visual
equivalents
of
sound
without
using
electricity
the
writer
as
he
called
employs
a
black
liquid
and
a
pointed
stick
called
a
pen
i
know
about
this
because
one
hobby
of
mine
is
ancient
means
of
communication
krumbine
frowned
and
shook
his
head
communication
is
a
dangerous
business
potshelter
especially
at
the
personal
level
with
you
and
me
it
all
right
because
we
know
what
we
doing
he
picked
up
a
third
blue
tranquilizer
but
with
most
of
the
communication
is
only
a
morbid
form
of
advertising
a
dangerous
travesty
of
normal
newscasting
catharsis
without
the
analyst
recitation
without
the
teacher
a
perversion
of
promotion
employed
in
betraying
and
subverting
the
frown
deepened
as
he
put
the
blue
pill
in
his
mouth
and
chewed
it
but
about
this
pen
do
you
mean
the
fellow
glues
the
pointed
stick
to
his
tongue
and
then
speaks
and
the
black
liquid
traces
the
vibrations
on
the
paper
a
primitive
oscilloscope
sloppy
but
conceivable
and
producing
a
record
of
sorts
of
the
spoken
word
no
no
krumbine
potshelter
nervously
popped
a
square
orange
tablet
into
his
mouth
it
a
letter
krumbine
watched
him
i
never
mix
tranquilizers
he
boasted
absently
eh
you
mean
that
the
message
was
imprinted
on
a
hand
and
the
skin
or
the
entire
hand
afterward
detached
and
sent
through
the
mails
in
the
fashion
of
a
martian
reproach
a
grisly
find
indeed
potshelter
you
still
do
quite
grasp
it
krumbine
the
fingers
of
the
hand
move
the
stick
that
applies
the
ink
producing
a
crude
imitation
of
the
printed
word
diabolical
krumbine
smashed
his
fist
down
on
the
desk
so
that
the
four
phones
and
microphones
rattled
i
tell
you
potshelter
the
sbi
is
ready
to
cope
with
the
subtlest
modern
deceptions
but
when
fiends
search
out
and
revive
tricks
from
the
cave
era
almost
too
much
but
great
scott
i
dally
while
the
planets
are
in
danger
what
the
sender
code
on
this
hellish
letter
no
code
potshelter
said
darkly
proferring
the
envelope
the
return
address
is
krumbine
blanched
as
his
eyes
slowly
traced
the
uneven
lines
in
the
upper
corner
richard

west
horizontal
rocket
court
vertical
hive
newnew
york
columbia
terra
ugh
krumbine
said
shivering
those
crawling
characters
those
letters
as
you
call
them
those
barely
enough
like
print
to
be
readable
they
seem
to
be
on
the
verge
of
awakening
all
sorts
of
horrid
racial
memories
i
find
myself
thinking
of
dipping
long
pointed
sticks
in
bubbling
black
cauldrons
no
wonder
pink
wastebasket
could
take
it
brave
girl
firming
himself
behind
his
desk
he
pushed
a
number
of
buttons
and
spoke
long
numbers
and
meaningful
alphabetical
syllables
into
several
microphones
banks
of
colored
lights
around
the
desk
began
to
blink
like
a
theatre
marquee
sending
morse
code
while
phosphorescent
arrows
crawled
purposefully
across
maps
and
and
through
street
diagrams
there
he
said
at
last
the
sender
of
the
letter
is
being
apprehended
and
will
be
brought
directly
here
we
see
what
sort
of
man
this
richard
rowe
is
if
we
can
assume
he
human
seven
precautionary
cordons
are
being
drawn
around
his
population
station
three
composed
of
machines
two
of
sbi
agents
and
two
consisting
of
human
and
mechanical
teams
same
goes
for
the
intended
recipient
of
the
letter
meanwhile
a
destroyer
squadron
of
the
solar
fleet
has
been
detached
to
orbit
over
newnew
york
in
case
it
becomes
necessary
to
potshelter
asked
grimly
krumbine
nodded
with
all
those
villains
lurking
just
outside
the
solar
system
in
their
invisible
black
ships
with
planeticide
in
their
hearts
we
ca
be
too
careful
one
word
transmitted
from
one
spy
to
another
and
anything
may
happen
and
we
must
bomb
before
they
do
so
as
to
contain
our
losses
better
one
city
destroyed
than
a
traitor
on
the
loose
who
may
destroy
many
cities
one
hundred
years
ago
three
postcards
went
through
the
mails
just
three
postcards
potshelter
and
went
schenectady
hoboken
cicero
and
walla
walla
here
as
long
as
you
mixing
them
try
one
of
these
oval
blues
i
find
them
best
for
steady
swallowing
bells
jangled
krumbine
grabbed
up
two
phones
holding
one
to
each
ear
potshelter
automatically
picked
up
a
third
the
ringing
continued
krumbine
started
to
wedge
one
of
his
phones
under
his
chin
nodded
sharply
at
potshelter
and
then
toward
a
cluster
of
microphones
at
the
end
of
the
table
potshelter
picked
up
a
fourth
phone
from
behind
them
the
ringing
stopped
the
two
men
listened
looking
doped
krumbine
with
an
eye
fixed
on
the
sweep
second
hand
of
the
large
wall
clock
when
it
had
made
one
revolution
he
cradled
his
phones
potshelter
followed
suit
i
do
like
the
simplicity
of
the
new
puffyloaf
the
latter
remarked
thoughtfully
the
bread
lighter
than
air
nice
krumbine
nodded
i
hear
they
had
to
add
mass
to
the
leadfoil
wrapping
to
keep
the
loaves
from
floating
off
the
shelves
fact
he
cleared
his
throat
too
bad
we
ca
listen
to
more
but
even
when
there
is
a
crisis
on
the
agenda
i
find
i
have
to
budget
my
listening
time
one
minute
per
hour
strikes
a
reasonable
balance
between
duty
and
the
nearest
wall
began
to
sing
mister
augustus
krumbine
we
all
think
you
fine
fine
fine
fine
now
out
of
the
skyey
blue
come
some
telegrams
for
you
the
wall
opened
to
a
small
heart
shape
toward
the
center
and
a
sheaf
of
pale
yellow
envelopes
arced
out
and
plopped
on
the
middle
of
the
desk
krumbine
started
to
leaf
through
them
scanning
the
little
transparent
windows
hm
electronic
soap
better
homes
and
landing
platforms
your
girl
next
door
he
started
to
open
an
envelope
then
after
a
quick
look
around
and
an
apologetic
smile
at
potshelter
dumped
them
all
on
the
disposal
hopper
which
gargled
briefly
after
all
there
a
crisis
this
morning
he
said
in
a
defensive
voice
potshelter
nodded
absently
i
can
remember
back
before
personalized
delivery
and
rhyming
robots
he
observed
but
how
i
miss
them
now
so
much
more
distingué
than
the
hives
with
their
radio
tv
and
stereo
advertising
for
that
matter
i
believe
there
are
some
backward
areas
on
terra
where
the
great
advertising
potential
of
telephones
and
telegrams
has
been
fully
realized
and
they
are
still
used
in
part
for
personal
communication
now
me
i
never
in
my
life
sent
or
received
a
message
except
on
my
he
patted
his
breast
pocket
krumbine
nodded
but
he
was
a
trifle
shocked
and
inclined
to
revise
his
estimate
of
potshelter
social
status
krumbine
conducted
his
own
social
correspondence
solely
by
telepathy
he
shared
with
three
other
sbi
officials
a
private
telepath
a
charming
albino
girl
named
agnes
yes
and
it
a
very
handsome
he
assured
potshelter
a
little
falsely
suits
you
i
like
the
upswept
antenna
he
drummed
on
the
desk
and
swallowed
another
blue
tranquilizer
dammit
happened
to
those
machines
they
ought
to
have
the
two
spies
here
by
now
did
you
notice
that
the
second
the
intended
recipient
of
the
letter
i
mean
seems
to
be
female
another
good
terran
name
too
jane
dough
hive
in
upper
manhattan
he
began
to
tap
the
envelope
sharply
against
the
desk
dammit
where
they
excuse
me
potshelter
said
hesitantly
but
i
wondering
why
you
have
read
the
message
inside
the
envelope
krumbine
looked
at
him
blankly
great
scott
i
assumed
that
at
least
was
in
some
secret
code
of
course
normally
i
have
asked
you
to
have
pink
wastebasket
try
her
skill
on
it
but
his
eyes
widened
and
his
voice
sank
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
it
potshelter
nodded
grimly
too
yes
krumbine
winced
i
keep
trying
to
forget
that
aspect
of
the
case
he
dug
out
the
message
with
shaking
fingers
fumbled
it
open
and
read
must
surprise
you
that
i
know
your
name
for
our
hives
are
widely
separated
do
you
recall
day
before
yesterday
when
your
guided
tour
of
grand
central
spaceport
got
stalled
because
the
aide
blew
a
fuse
i
was
the
young
man
with
hair
in
the
tour
behind
yours
you
were
a
little
frightened
and
a
groupmistress
was
reassuring
you
the
machine
spoke
your
then
i
have
been
unable
to
forget
you
when
i
go
to
sleep
i
dream
of
your
face
looking
up
sadly
at
the
mistress
kindly
photocells
i
do
know
how
to
get
in
touch
with
you
but
my
grandfather
has
told
me
stories
his
grandfather
told
him
that
his
grandfather
told
him
about
young
men
writing
what
he
calls
to
young
ladies
so
i
am
writing
you
a
work
in
a
advertising
house
and
i
will
slip
this
into
an
outgoing
and
not
be
frightened
of
me
jane
i
am
no
caveman
except
for
my
hair
i
am
not
insane
i
am
emotionally
disturbed
but
in
a
way
that
no
machine
has
ever
described
to
me
i
want
only
your
krumbine
slumped
back
in
his
chair
which
braced
itself
manfully
against
him
and
looked
long
and
thoughtfully
at
potshelter
well
if
that
a
code
it
certainly
a
fiendishly
subtle
one
you
think
he
was
talking
to
his
girl
next
door
potshelter
nodded
wonderingly
i
only
read
as
far
as
where
they
were
planning
to
blow
up
grand
central
spaceport
and
all
the
guides
in
it
judas
priest
i
think
i
have
it
krumbine
shot
up
it
a
pilot
advertisement
boy
next
door
or
that
kind
of
thing
printed
to
look
like
which
would
make
all
the
difference
and
the
pilot
copy
got
mailed
by
accident
which
would
mean
there
is
no
real
richard
rowe
at
that
instant
the
door
dilated
and
two
blue
detective
engines
hustled
a
struggling
young
man
into
the
office
he
was
slim
rather
handsome
had
a
bushy
head
of
hair
that
had
somehow
survived
evolution
and
radioactive
fallout
and
across
the
chest
and
back
of
his
paper
singlet
was
neatly
stamped
richard
rowe
when
he
saw
the
two
men
he
stopped
struggling
and
straightened
up
excuse
me
gentlemen
he
said
but
these
police
machines
must
have
made
a
mistake
i
committed
no
crime
then
his
gaze
fell
on
the
envelope
on
krumbine
desk
and
he
turned
pale
krumbine
laughed
harshly
no
crime
no
not
at
all
merely
using
the
mails
to
communicate
ha
the
young
man
shrank
back
i
sorry
sir
sorry
he
says
do
you
realize
that
your
insane
prank
has
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
perhaps
a
pieces
of
advertising
in
the
strangulation
of
a
postal
station
and
the
paralysis
of
lower
manhattan
in
the
mobilization
of
sbi
reserves
the
of
two
divisions
of
machines
and
the
redeployment
of
the
solar
battle
fleet
good
lord
boy
why
did
you
do
it
richard
rowe
continued
to
shrink
but
he
squared
his
shoulders
sorry
sir
but
i
just
had
to
i
just
had
to
get
in
touch
with
jane
dough
a
girl
from
another
hive
a
girl
you
merely
gazed
at
because
a
guide
happened
to
blow
a
fuse
krumbine
stood
up
shaking
an
angry
finger
great
scott
boy
where
was
your
girl
next
door
richard
rowe
stared
bravely
at
the
finger
which
made
him
look
a
trifle
she
died
sir
both
of
them
but
there
should
be
at
least
six
i
know
sir
but
of
the
other
four
two
have
been
shipped
to
the
adirondacks
on
vacation
and
two
recently
got
married
and
have
been
replaced
potshelter
a
faraway
look
in
his
eyes
said
softly
i
think
beginning
to
understand
but
krumbine
thundered
on
at
richard
rowe
with
good
lord
i
can
see
you
had
your
troubles
boy
it
is
often
we
have
these
shortages
of
girls
next
door
so
that
temporarily
a
boy
ca
marry
the
girl
next
door
as
he
always
should
but
judas
priest
why
did
you
take
your
troubles
to
your
psychiatrist
your
groupmaster
your
socializer
your
queen
mother
my
psychiatrist
is
being
overhauled
sir
and
his
replacement
every
time
he
hears
the
word
my
groupmaster
and
socializer
are
on
vacation
duty
in
the
adirondacks
my
queen
mother
is
busy
replacing
girls
next
door
yes
it
all
fits
potshelter
proclaimed
excitedly
do
you
see
krumbine
except
for
a
set
of
mischances
that
would
only
occur
once
in
a
billion
billion
times
the
letter
would
never
have
been
conceived
or
sent
you
may
have
something
there
krumbine
concurred
but
in
any
case
boy
why
did
you
er
written
this
letter
to
this
particular
girl
what
is
there
about
jane
dough
that
made
you
do
it
well
you
see
sir
she
just
then
the
door
and
a
blue
matron
machine
conducted
a
young
woman
into
the
office
she
was
slim
and
she
had
a
head
of
hair
that
would
have
graced
a
museum
beauty
while
across
the
back
and
well
chest
is
an
inadequate
word
of
her
paper
chemise
jane
dough
was
in
the
palest
pink
krumbine
did
not
repeat
his
last
question
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
it
had
been
answered
fully
potshelter
whistled
respectfully
the
blue
detective
engines
gave
grunts
even
the
blue
matron
machine
seemed
awed
by
the
girl
beauty
but
she
had
eyes
only
for
richard
rowe
my
grand
central
man
she
breathed
in
amazement
the
man
i
dreamed
of
ever
since
my
man
with
hair
she
noticed
the
way
he
was
looking
at
her
and
she
breathed
harder
oh
darling
what
have
you
done
i
tried
to
send
you
a
letter
a
letter
for
me
oh
darling
krumbine
cleared
his
throat
potshelter
i
going
to
wind
this
up
fast
miss
dough
could
you
transfer
to
this
young
man
hive
oh
yes
sir
mine
has
an
of
girls
next
door
good
rowe
there
a
two
levels
up
look
for
the
usual
white
collar
just
below
the
photocells
marry
this
girl
and
take
her
home
to
your
hive
if
your
queen
mother
objects
refer
her
to
er
potshelter
here
he
cut
short
the
young
people
thanks
just
one
thing
he
said
wagging
a
finger
at
rowe
do
written
any
more
letters
why
ever
would
i
richard
answered
already
my
action
is
beginning
to
seem
like
a
mad
dream
not
to
me
dear
jane
corrected
him
oh
sir
could
i
have
the
letter
he
sent
me
not
to
do
anything
with
not
to
show
anyone
just
to
keep
well
i
do
know
krumbine
began
oh
sir
well
i
do
know
why
not
i
was
going
to
say
here
you
are
miss
just
see
that
this
husband
of
yours
never
writtens
another
he
turned
back
as
the
contracting
door
shut
the
young
couple
from
view
you
were
right
potshelter
he
said
briskly
it
was
one
of
those
combinations
of
mischances
that
come
up
only
once
in
a
billion
billion
times
but
we
going
to
have
to
issue
recommendations
for
new
procedures
and
safeguards
that
will
reduce
the
possibilities
to
one
in
a
trillion
trillion
it
will
undoubtedly
up
the
terran
income
tax
a
healthy
percentage
but
we
ca
have
something
like
this
happening
again
every
boy
must
marry
the
girl
next
door
and
the
mails
must
not
be
interfered
with
the
advertising
must
go
through
i
almost
like
to
see
it
happen
again
potshelter
murmured
dreamily
if
there
were
another
jane
dough
in
it
outside
richard
and
jane
had
halted
to
allow
a
small
cortege
of
machines
to
pass
first
came
a
squad
of
police
machines
with
black
sorter
in
their
midst
unmuzzled
and
docile
enough
though
still
gnashing
his
teeth
softly
then
stretched
out
horizontally
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
gray
psychiatrist
black
coroner
white
nursemaid
seven
and
greasy
joe
there
passed
the
slim
form
of
pink
wastebasket
in
death
the
machines
were
keening
softly
mournfully
round
about
the
black
pillars
little
were
scurrying
like
mice
cleaning
up
the
last
of
the
bits
of
confetti
richard
winced
at
this
evidence
of
his
aberration
but
jane
squeezed
his
hand
comfortingly
which
produced
in
him
a
truly
amazing
sensation
that
changed
his
whole
appearance
i
know
how
you
feel
darling
she
told
him
but
do
worry
about
it
just
think
dear
i
always
be
able
to
tell
your
friends
wives
something
no
other
woman
in
the
world
can
boast
of
that
my
husband
once
wrote
me
a
letter
