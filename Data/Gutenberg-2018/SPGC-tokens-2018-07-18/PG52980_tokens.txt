the
philosophy
of

by

professor
of
æsthetics
and
of
the
history
of
art
in
the
école

translated
by
john

edition
thoroughly
revised
by
the
new
york
holt
williams
publishers
note
the
now
famous
name
of
taine
was
first
introduced
to
the
american
public
by
the
issue
in
of
a
small
imported
edition
of
this
work
that
edition
has
long
been
out
of
print
here
and
in
europe
that
the
book
is
now
may
be
subject
of
special
satisfaction
to
those
who
already
possess
the
author
in
in
the
and
in
as
this
work
now
published
in
a
style
uniform
with
others
named
is
properly
the
forerunner
of
them
all
containing
as
it
does
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
first
course
of
lectures
and
constantly
referred
to
in
the
later
courses
which
now
form
the
books
before
alluded
to
in
preparing
this
edition
for
the
press
the
translator
by
bringing
to
bear
the
experience
gained
in
the
later
works
has
made
it
a
great
improvement
on
the
previous
edition
preface
to
the
first
edition
the
translation
herewith
presented
to
the
reader
consists
of
a
course
of
lectures
delivered
during
the
winter
of
before
the
students
of
art
of
the
des
beaux
at
paris
by
taine
et
d
histoire
de
in
that
institution
these
lectures
as
a
system
of
æsthetics
consist
of
an
application
of
the
experimental
method
to
art
in
the
same
manner
as
it
is
applied
to
the
sciences
whatever
utility
the
system
possesses
is
due
to
this
principle
the
author
undertakes
to
explain
art
by
social
influences
and
other
causes
humanity
at
different
times
and
places
climate
and
other
conditions
furnish
the
facts
on
which
the
theory
rests
the
artistic
development
of
any
age
or
people
is
made
intelligible
through
a
series
of
historical
inductions
terminating
in
a
few
inferential
laws
constituting
what
the
title
of
the
book
declares
it
to
be
philosophy
of
such
a
system
seems
to
possess
many
advantages
among
others
it
tends
to
emancipate
the
student
of
art
as
well
as
the
amateur
from
metaphysical
and
visionary
theories
growing
out
of
false
theories
and
traditional
misconceptions
he
is
not
misled
by
an
exclusive
adherence
to
particular
schools
masters
or
epochs
it
also
tends
to
render
criticism
less
capricious
and
therefore
less
injurious
dictating
no
conventional
standard
of
judgment
it
promotes
a
spirit
of
charity
towards
all
works
as
there
is
no
attempt
to
do
more
than
explain
art
according
to
natural
laws
the
reader
must
judge
whether
like
all
systems
assuming
to
bring
order
out
of
confusion
this
one
fulfils
its
mission
readers
familiar
with
taine
able
and

recognize
in

preface
to
the
second
edition
since
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
of
the
of
seven
years
ago
in
london
its
author
has
become
deservedly
popular
and
especially
in
this
country
his
writings
are
sought
for
read
and
translated
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
it
would
be
but
refining
gold
to
say
aught
in
his
praise
like
every
man
of
genius
he
has
as
time
moves
on
improved
in
his
order
of
thought
and
in
his
wonderfully
artistic
style
his
latest
work
ranks
him
as
high
among
thinkers
as
his
former
works
among
men
of
letters
the
present
edition
is
a
careful
revision
of
the
former
one
and
amounts
indeed
to
a
new
translation
were
either
to
be
compared
with
the
original
no
change
of
sense
could
probably
be
detected
the
present
edition
however
being
much
more
literal
the
translator
considers
it
an
improvement
and
hopes
that
it
will
be
found
more
worthy

gentlemen
in
commencing
this
course
of
lectures
i
wish
to
ask
you
two
things
of
which
i
stand
in
great
need
in
the
first
place
your
attention
afterwards
and
especially
your
kind
indulgence
the
warmth
of
your
reception
persuades
me
that
you
will
favor
me
with
both
let
me
sincerely
and
earnestly
thank
you
beforehand
the
subject
with
which
i
intend
to
entertain
you
this
year
is
the
history
of
art
and
principally
the
history
of
painting
in
italy
before
entering
on
the
subject
itself
i
desire
to
indicate
to
you
its
spirit
and
method
i
the
principal
point
of
this
method
consists
in
recognizing
that
a
work
of
art
is
not
isolated
and
consequently
that
it
is
necessary
to
study
the
conditions
out
of
which
it
proceeds
and
by
which
it
is
explained
the
first
step
is
not
difficult
at
first
and
evidently
a
work
of
art
a
picture
a
tragedy
a
statue
belongs
to
a
certain
whole
that
is
to
say
to
the
entire
work
of
the
artist
producing
it
this
is
elementary
it
is
well
known
that
the
different
works
of
an
artist
bear
a
family
likeness
like
the
children
of
one
parent
that
is
to
say
they
bear
a
certain
resemblance
to
each
other
we
know
that
every
artist
has
his
own
style
a
style
recognized
in
all
his
productions
if
he
is
a
painter
he
has
his
own
coloring
rich
or
impoverished
his
favorite
types
noble
or
ignoble
his
attitudes
his
mode
of
composition
even
his
processes
of
execution
his
favorite
pigments
tints
models
and
manner
of
working
if
he
is
a
writer
he
has
his
own
characters
calm
or
passionate
his
own
plots
simple
or
complex
his
own
dénouements
comic
or
tragic
his
peculiarities
of
style
his
pet
periods
and
even
his
special
vocabulary
this
is
so
true
that
a
connoisseur
if
you
place
before
him
a
work
not
signed
by
any
prominent
master
is
able
to
recognize
to
almost
a
certainty
to
what
artist
this
work
belongs
and
if
sufficiently
experienced
and
delicate
in
his
perceptions
the
period
of
the
artist
life
and
the
particular
stage
of
his
development
this
is
the
first
whole
to
which
we
must
refer
a
work
of
art
and
here
is
the
second
the
artist
himself
considered
in
connection
with
his
productions
is
not
isolated
he
also
belongs
to
a
whole
one
greater
than
himself
comprising
the
school
or
family
of
artists
of
the
time
and
country
to
which
he
belongs
for
example
around
shakespeare
who
at
the
first
glance
seems
to
be
a
marvellous
celestial
gift
coming
like
an
aerolite
from
heaven
we
find
several
dramatists
of
a
high
order
webster
ford
massinger
marlowe
ben
jonson
beaumont
and
fletcher
all
of
whom
wrote
in
the
same
style
and
in
the
same
spirit
as
he
did
there
are
the
same
characters
in
their
dramas
as
in
shakespeare
the
same
violent
and
terrible
characters
the
same
murderous
and
unforeseen
occurrences
the
same
sudden
and
frenzied
passions
the
same
irregular
capricious
turgid
magnificent
style
the
same
exquisite
poetic
feeling
for
rural
life
and
landscape
and
the
same
delicate
tender
affectionate
ideals
of
woman
in
a
similar
way
rubens
is
to
be
judged
rubens
apparently
stands
alone
without
either
predecessor
or
successor
on
going
to
belgium
however
and
visiting
the
churches
of
ghent
brussels
bruges
or
antwerp
you
find
a
group
of
painters
with
genius
resembling
his
first
there
is
crayer
in
his
day
considered
a
rival
seghers
van
oost
everdingen
van
thulden
quellin
hondthorst
and
others
with
whom
you
are
familiar
jordaens
van
dyck
all
conceiving
painting
in
the
same
spirit
and
with
many
distinctive
features
all
preserving
a
family
likeness
like
rubens
these
artists
delighted
in
painting
ruddy
and
healthy
flesh
the
rich
and
quivering
palpitation
of
life
the
fresh
and
sensuous
pulp
which
is
diffused
so
richly
over
the
surface
of
the
living
being
the
real
and
often
brutal
types
the
transport
and
abandonment
of
unfettered
action
the
splendid
lustrous
and
embroidered
draperies
the
varying
hues
of
silk
and
purple
and
the
display
of
shifting
and
waving
folds
at
the
present
day
they
seem
to
be
obscured
by
the
glory
of
their
great
contemporary
but
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
to
comprehend
him
it
is
necessary
to
study
him
amidst
this
cluster
of
brilliants
of
which
he
is
the
brightest
gem
this
family
of
artists
of
which
he
is
the
most
illustrious
representative
this
being
the
second
step
there
now
remains
the
third
this
family
of
artists
is
itself
comprehended
in
another
whole
more
vast
which
is
the
world
surrounding
it
and
whose
taste
is
similar
the
social
and
intellectual
condition
is
the
same
for
the
public
as
for
artists
they
are
not
isolated
men
it
is
their
voice
alone
that
we
hear
at
this
moment
through
the
space
of
centuries
but
beneath
this
living
voice
which
comes
vibrating
to
us
we
distinguish
a
murmur
and
as
it
were
a
vast
low
sound
the
great
infinite
and
varied
voice
of
the
people
chanting
in
unison
with
them
they
have
been
great
through
this
harmony
and
it
is
very
necessary
that
it
should
ever
be
so
phidias
and
ictinus
the
constructors
of
the
parthenon
and
of
the
olympian
jupiter
were
like
other
athenians
pagans
and
free
citizens
brought
up
in
the
exercising
and
wrestling
naked
and
accustomed
to
deliberate
and
vote
in
the
public
assemblies
possessing
the
same
habits
the
same
interests
the
same
ideas
the
same
faith
men
of
the
same
race
the
same
education
the
same
language
so
that
in
all
the
important
acts
of
their
life
they
are
found
in
harmony
with
their
spectators
this
harmony
becomes
still
more
apparent
if
we
consider
an
age
nearer
our
own
for
example
take
the
great
spanish
epoch
of
the
sixteenth
and
a
part
of
the
seventeenth
centuries
in
which
lived
the
great
painters
velasquez
murillo
zurbaran
francisco
de
herrera
alonzo
cano
and
morales
and
the
great
poets
lope
de
vega
calderon
cervantes
tirso
de
molina
don
luis
de
leon
guilhem
de
castro
and
so
many
others
you
know
that
at
this
time
spain
was
entirely
monarchical
and
catholic
that
she
had
the
turks
at
lepanto
that
she
planted
her
foot
in
africa
and
maintained
herself
there
that
she
combated
the
protestants
in
germany
pursued
them
in
france
and
attacked
them
in
england
that
she
subdued
and
converted
the
idolaters
of
the
new
world
and
chased
away
jews
and
moors
from
her
own
soil
that
she
purged
her
own
faith
with
autodafés
and
persecutions
that
she
lavished
fleets
and
armies
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
her
american
possessions
along
with
her
most
precious
children
the
vital
blood
of
her
own
heart
upon
multiplied
and
boundless
crusades
so
obstinately
and
so
fanatically
that
at
the
end
of
a
century
and
a
half
she
fell
prostrate
at
the
feet
of
europe
but
with
such
enthusiasm
such
a
burst
of
glory
such
national
fervor
that
her
subjects
enamored
of
the
monarchy
in
which
their
power
was
concentrated
and
with
the
cause
to
which
they
devoted
their
lives
felt
no
other
desire
than
that
of
elevating
religion
and
royalty
by
their
obedience
and
of
forming
around
the
church
and
the
throne
a
choir
of
faithful
militant
and
adoring
supporters
in
this
monarchy
of
crusaders
and
inquisitors
preserving
the
chivalric
sentiments
and
sombre
passions
the
ferocity
intolerance
and
mysticism
of
the
middle
ages
the
greatest
artists
are
the
very
men
who
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
the
faculties
sentiments
and
passions
of
the
public
that
surrounded
them
the
most
celebrated
poets
lope
de
vega
and
calderon
were
military
adventurers
volunteers
in
the
armada
duellists
and
lovers
as
exalted
and
as
mystic
in
love
as
the
poets
and
don
quixotes
of
feudal
times
they
were
passionate
catholics
and
so
ardent
that
at
the
end
of
their
lives
one
became
a
familiar
of
the
inquisition
others
became
priests
and
the
most
illustrious
among
them
the
great
lope
de
vega
fainted
on
saying
mass
at
the
thought
of
the
sacrifice
and
martyrdom
of
jesus
everywhere
may
be
found
similar
examples
of
the
alliance
the
intimate
harmony
existing
between
an
artist
and
his
contemporaries
and
we
may
rest
assured
that
if
we
desire
to
comprehend
the
taste
or
the
genius
of
an
artist
the
reasons
leading
him
to
choose
a
particular
style
of
painting
or
drama
to
prefer
this
or
that
character
or
coloring
and
to
represent
particular
sentiments
we
must
seek
for
them
in
the
social
and
intellectual
conditions
of
the
community
in
the
midst
of
which
he
lived
we
have
therefore
to
lay
down
this
rule
that
in
order
to
comprehend
a
work
of
art
an
artist
or
a
group
of
artists
we
must
clearly
comprehend
the
general
social
and
intellectual
condition
of
the
times
to
which
they
belong
herein
is
to
be
found
the
final
explanation
herein
resides
the
primitive
cause
determining
all
that
follows
it
this
truth
gentlemen
is
confirmed
by
experience
in
short
if
we
pass
in
review
the
principal
epochs
of
the
history
of
art
we
find
that
the
arts
appear
and
disappear
along
with
certain
accompanying
social
and
intellectual
conditions
for
example
the
greek
tragedy
that
of
æschylus
sophocles
and
euripides
appears
at
the
time
when
the
greeks
were
victorious
over
the
persians
at
the
heroic
era
of
small
republican
cities
at
the
moment
of
the
great
struggle
by
which
they
acquired
their
independence
and
established
their
ascendency
in
the
civilized
world
and
we
see
it
disappearing
along
with
this
independence
and
this
vigor
when
a
degeneracy
of
character
and
the
macedonian
conquest
delivered
greece
over
to
strangers
it
is
the
same
with
gothic
architecture
developing
along
with
the
definitive
establishment
of
feudalism
in
the
of
the
eleventh
century
at
the
period
when
society
delivered
from
brigands
and
normans
began
to
consolidate
and
disappearing
at
the
period
when
the
military
system
of
petty
independent
barons
with
the
manners
and
customs
growing
out
of
it
vanished
near
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
on
the
advent
of
modern
monarchies
it
is
the
same
with
dutch
painting
which
flourished
at
the
glorious
period
when
through
firmness
and
courage
holland
succeeded
in
freeing
herself
from
spanish
rule
combated
england
with
equal
power
and
became
the
richest
freest
most
industrious
and
most
prosperous
state
in
europe
and
we
see
it
declining
at
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
holland
fallen
into
a
secondary
rank
leaves
the
first
to
england
reducing
itself
to
a
safely
administered
quiet
commercial
in
which
man
an
honest
could
live
at
ease
exempt
from
every
great
ambition
and
every
grand
emotion
it
is
the
same
finally
with
french
tragedy
appearing
at
the
period
when
a
noble
and
monarchy
under
louis
established
the
empire
of
decorum
the
life
of
the
court
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
society
and
the
elegant
domestic
phases
of
aristocracy
disappearing
when
the
social
rule
of
nobles
and
the
manners
of
the
antechamber
were
abolished
by
the
revolution
i
would
like
to
make
you
more
sensible
by
a
comparison
of
this
effect
of
the
social
and
intellectual
state
on
the
fine
arts
suppose
you
are
leaving
the
land
of
the
south
for
that
of
the
north
you
perceive
on
entering
a
certain
zone
a
particular
mode
of
cultivation
and
a
particular
species
of
plant
first
come
the
aloe
and
the
orange
a
little
later
the
vine
and
the
olive
after
these
the
oak
and
the
chestnut
a
little
further
on
oats
and
the
pine
and
finally
mosses
and
lichens
each
zone
has
its
own
mode
of
cultivation
and
peculiar
vegetation
both
begin
at
the
commencement
and
both
finish
at
the
end
of
the
zone
both
are
attached
to
it
the
zone
is
the
condition
of
their
existence
by
its
presence
or
its
absence
is
determined
what
shall
appear
and
what
shall
disappear
now
what
is
this
zone
but
a
certain
temperature
in
other
words
a
certain
degree
of
heat
and
moisture
in
short
a
certain
number
of
governing
circumstances
analogous
in
its
germ
to
that
which
we
called
a
moment
ago
the
social
and
intellectual
state
just
as
there
is
a
physical
temperature
which
by
its
variations
determines
the
appearance
of
this
or
that
species
of
plant
so
is
there
a
moral
temperature
which
by
its
variations
determines
the
appearance
of
this
or
that
species
of
art
and
as
we
study
the
physical
temperature
in
order
to
comprehend
the
advent
of
this
or
that
species
of
plants
whether
maize
or
oats
the
orange
or
the
pine
so
is
it
necessary
to
study
the
moral
temperature
in
order
to
comprehend
the
advent
of
various
phases
of
art
whether
pagan
sculpture
or
realistic
painting
mystic
architecture
or
classic
literature
voluptuous
music
or
ideal
poetry
the
productions
of
the
human
mind
like
those
of
animated
nature
can
only
be
explained
by
their
hence
the
study
i
intend
to
offer
you
this
season
of
the
history
of
painting
in
italy
i
shall
attempt
to
lay
before
your
eyes
the
mystic
in
which
appeared
giotto
and
beato
angelico
and
to
this
end
i
shall
read
passages
from
the
poets
and
legendary
writers
containing
the
ideas
entertained
by
the
men
of
those
days
concerning
happiness
misery
love
faith
paradise
hell
and
all
the
great
interests
of
humanity
we
shall
find
documentary
evidence
in
the
poetry
of
dante
of
guido
cavalcanti
of
the
franciscans
in
the
golden
legend
in
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
in
the
fioretti
of
francis
in
the
works
of
historians
like
dino
campagni
and
in
that
vast
collection
of
chroniclers
by
muratori
which
so
naively
portray
the
jealousies
and
disturbances
of
the
small
italian
republics
after
this
i
shall
attempt
to
place
before
you
in
the
same
manner
the
pagan
which
a
century
and
a
half
later
produced
leonardo
da
vinci
michael
angelo
raphael
and
titian
and
to
this
end
i
shall
read
either
from
the
memoirs
of
contemporaries
benvenuto
cellini
for
instance
or
from
the
diverse
chronicles
kept
daily
in
rome
and
in
the
principal
italian
cities
or
from
the
despatches
of
ambassadors
or
finally
from
the
descriptions
of
fêtes
masquerades
and
civic
receptions
which
are
remarkable
fragments
displaying
the
brutality
sensuality
and
vigor
of
society
as
well
as
the
lively
poetic
sentiment
the
love
of
the
picturesque
the
great
literary
sentiment
the
decorative
instincts
and
the
passion
for
external
splendor
which
at
that
time
are
seen
as
well
among
the
people
and
the
ignorant
crowd
as
among
the
great
and
the
lettered
suppose
now
gentlemen
we
should
succeed
in
this
undertaking
and
that
we
should
be
able
to
mark
clearly
and
precisely
the
various
intellectual
conditions
which
have
led
to
the
birth
of
italian
painting
its
development
its
bloom
its
varieties
and
decline
suppose
the
same
undertaking
successful
with
other
countries
and
other
ages
and
with
the
different
branches
of
art
architecture
sculpture
painting
poetry
and
music
suppose
that
through
the
effect
of
all
these
discoveries
we
succeed
in
defining
the
nature
and
in
marking
the
conditions
of
existence
of
each
art
we
shall
then
have
a
complete
explanation
of
the
fine
arts
and
of
all
in
general
that
is
to
say
a
philosophy
of
the
fine
arts
what
is
called
an
system
this
is
what
we
aim
at
gentlemen
and
nothing
else
ours
is
modern
and
differs
from
the
ancient
inasmuch
as
it
is
historic
and
not
dogmatic
that
is
to
say
it
imposes
no
precepts
but
ascertains
and
verifies
laws
ancient
æsthetics
gave
at
first
a
definition
of
beauty
and
declared
for
instance
that
the
beautiful
is
the
expression
of
the
moral
ideal
or
rather
is
the
expression
of
the
invisible
or
rather
still
is
the
expression
of
the
human
passions
then
starting
hence
as
from
an
article
of
a
code
they
absolved
condemned
admonished
and
directed
it
is
my
good
fortune
not
to
have
such
a
formidable
task
to
meet
i
do
not
wish
to
guide
you
it
would
embarrass
me
too
much
besides
i
say
with
all
humility
that
as
to
precepts
we
have
as
yet
found
but
two
the
first
is
to
be
born
a
genius
an
affair
of
your
parents
and
not
mine
and
the
second
which
implies
much
labor
in
order
to
master
art
which
likewise
does
not
depend
on
me
but
on
yourselves
my
sole
duty
is
to
offer
you
facts
and
show
you
how
these
facts
are
produced
the
modern
method
which
i
strive
to
pursue
and
which
is
beginning
to
be
introduced
in
all
the
moral
sciences
consists
in
considering
human
productions
and
particularly
works
of
art
as
facts
and
productions
of
which
it
is
essential
to
mark
the
characteristics
and
seek
the
causes
and
nothing
more
thus
understood
science
neither
pardons
nor
proscribes
it
verifies
and
explains
it
does
not
say
to
you
despise
dutch
art
because
it
is
vulgar
and
prize
only
italian
art
nor
does
it
say
to
you
despise
gothic
art
because
it
is
morbid
and
prize
only
greek
art
it
leaves
every
one
free
to
follow
their
own
predilections
to
prefer
that
which
is
germane
to
one
temperament
and
to
study
with
the
greatest
care
that
which
best
corresponds
to
the
development
of
one
own
mind
science
has
sympathies
for
all
the
forms
of
art
and
for
all
schools
even
for
those
the
most
opposed
to
each
other
it
accepts
them
as
so
many
manifestations
of
the
human
mind
judging
that
the
more
numerous
they
are
and
the
more
antithetical
the
more
they
show
the
human
mind
in
its
innumerable
and
novel
phases
it
is
analogous
to
botany
which
studies
the
orange
the
laurel
the
pine
and
the
birch
with
equal
interest
it
is
itself
a
species
of
botany
applied
not
to
plants
but
to
the
works
of
man
by
virtue
of
this
it
keeps
pace
with
the
general
movement
of
the
day
which
now
affiliates
the
moral
sciences
with
the
natural
sciences
and
which
giving
to
the
first
the
principles
precautions
and
directions
of
the
second
gives
to
them
the
same
stability
and
assures
them
the
same
progress
ii
i
wish
to
apply
at
once
this
method
to
the
first
and
principal
question
by
which
a
course
of
æsthetics
is
opened
out
and
which
is
a
definition
of
art
what
is
art
and
in
what
does
its
nature
consist
instead
of
establishing
a
formula
i
wish
to
familiarize
you
with
facts
for
facts
exist
here
as
elsewhere
positive
facts
open
to
observation
i
mean
of
arranged
by
families
in
galleries
and
libraries
like
plants
in
an
herbarium
and
animals
in
a
museum
analysis
may
be
applied
to
the
one
as
to
the
others
a
work
of
art
may
be
investigated
generally
as
we
investigate
a
plant
or
an
animal
generally
there
is
no
more
need
of
discarding
experience
in
the
first
case
than
in
the
second
the
entire
process
consists
in
discovering
by
numerous
comparisons
and
progressive
eliminations
traits
common
to
all
works
of
art
and
at
the
same
time
the
distinctive
traits
by
which
works
of
art
are
separated
from
other
productions
of
the
human
intellect
to
this
end
we
will
among
the
five
great
arts
of
poetry
sculpture
painting
architecture
and
music
set
aside
the
last
two
of
which
the
explanation
is
more
difficult
and
to
which
we
will
return
afterwards
we
shall
at
present
consider
only
the
three
first
all
as
you
are
aware
possess
a
common
character
that
of
being
more
or
less
arts
at
the
first
glance
it
seems
that
this
is
their
principal
character
and
their
object
is
imitation
as
exact
as
possible
for
it
is
plain
that
a
statue
is
meant
to
imitate
accurately
a
really
living
man
that
a
picture
is
intended
to
portray
real
persons
in
real
attitudes
the
interior
of
a
house
and
a
landscape
such
as
nature
presents
it
is
no
less
evident
that
a
drama
a
romance
attempts
to
represent
faithfully
characters
actions
and
actual
speech
and
to
give
as
precise
and
as
accurate
a
picture
of
them
as
is
possible
when
accordingly
the
image
is
inadequate
or
inexact
we
say
to
the
sculptor
this
breast
or
this
limb
is
not
well
executed
and
to
the
painter
the
figures
of
your
background
are
too
large
the
coloring
of
your
trees
is
faulty
and
we
say
to
the
author
never
did
man
feel
or
think
as
you
have
imagined
him
but
there
are
other
proofs
still
stronger
and
first
experience
when
we
behold
what
takes
place
in
the
life
of
an
artist
we
perceive
that
it
is
generally
divided
into
two
sections
during
the
first
in
the
youth
and
maturity
of
his
talent
he
sees
things
as
they
are
and
studies
them
minutely
and
earnestly
he
fixes
his
eyes
on
them
he
labors
and
worries
to
express
them
and
he
expresses
them
with
more
than
scrupulous
fidelity
arriving
at
a
certain
moment
of
life
he
thinks
he
understands
them
thoroughly
and
discovers
no
more
novelty
in
them
he
casts
aside
the
living
model
and
with
certain
prescribed
rules
which
he
has
picked
up
in
the
course
of
his
experience
he
forms
a
drama
or
a
romance
a
picture
or
a
statue
the
first
epoch
is
that
of
natural
feeling
the
second
that
of
mannerism
and
decline
if
we
penetrate
the
lives
of
the
greatest
men
we
rarely
fail
to
discover
both
in
the
life
of
michael
angelo
the
first
period
lasted
a
long
time
a
little
less
than
sixty
years
all
the
works
belonging
to
it
disclose
the
sentiment
of
force
and
heroic
grandeur
the
artist
is
imbued
with
it
he
has
no
other
thought
his
numerous
dissections
his
countless
drawings
the
unremitted
analysis
of
his
own
heart
his
study
of
the
tragic
passions
and
of
their
physical
expression
are
for
him
but
the
means
of
manifesting
outwardly
the
militant
energy
with
which
he
is
carried
away
this
idea
descends
upon
you
from
every
corner
of
the
great
vault
of
the
sistine
chapel
enter
the
pauline
chapel
alongside
of
it
and
contemplate
the
works
of
his
old
age
the
conversion
of
paul
the
crucifixion
of
peter
consider
even
the
last
judgment
which
he
painted
in
his
year
connoisseurs
and
those
who
are
not
recognize
at
once
that
the
two
frescoes
are
executed
according
to
prescribed
rules
that
the
artist
possessed
a
certain
number
of
forms
which
he
used
conventionally
that
he
multiplied
extraordinary
attitudes
and
ingeniously
contrived
foreshortenings
that
the
lively
invention
naturalness
the
great
transport
of
the
heart
the
perfect
truth
peculiar
to
his
first
works
have
at
least
in
part
disappeared
from
the
abuse
of
technique
and
the
force
of
routine
and
that
if
he
is
still
superior
to
others
he
is
greatly
inferior
to
himself
the
same
comment
may
be
made
on
another
life
that
of
our
french
michael
angelo
corneille
in
the
first
years
of
his
life
corneille
was
likewise
struck
by
the
feeling
of
force
and
of
moral
heroism
he
found
it
around
him
in
the
vigorous
passions
bequeathed
by
the
religious
wars
to
the
new
monarchy
in
the
daring
acts
of
duellists
in
the
proud
feeling
of
honor
which
still
carried
away
the
devotees
of
feudalism
in
the
bloody
tragedies
which
the
plots
of
princes
and
the
executions
of
richelieu
furnished
as
spectacles
for
the
court
and
he
created
personages
like
and
the
like
and
like
sertorius
émilie
and
afterwards
he
produced
attila
and
other
feeble
works
in
which
the
situations
merge
into
the
horrible
and
generous
emotions
lose
themselves
in
extravagance
in
this
period
the
living
models
he
once
contemplated
no
longer
had
a
social
setting
at
least
he
no
longer
sought
them
he
failed
to
renew
his
inspiration
he
was
governed
by
prescribed
rules
due
to
the
memory
of
processes
which
he
had
formerly
found
in
the
heat
of
enthusiasm
literary
theories
dissertations
and
distinctions
on
theatrical
catastrophes
and
dramatic
licenses
he
copied
and
exaggerated
himself
learning
calculation
and
routine
shut
out
from
him
the
direct
and
personal
contemplation
of
powerful
emotions
and
of
noble
actions
he
no
longer
created
but
manufactured
it
is
not
alone
the
history
of
this
or
that
great
man
which
proves
to
us
the
necessity
of
imitating
the
living
model
and
of
keeping
the
eye
fixed
on
nature
but
rather
the
history
of
every
great
school
of
art
every
school
i
believe
without
exception
degenerates
and
falls
simply
through
its
neglect
of
exact
imitation
and
its
abandonment
of
the
living
model
you
see
it
in
painting
in
the
fabricators
of
muscles
and
exaggerated
attitudes
who
succeeded
michael
angelo
in
the
sciolists
of
theatrical
decorations
and
in
the
brawny
rotundities
which
have
followed
the
great
venetians
and
in
the
boudoir
and
alcove
painters
which
closed
the
french
school
of
art
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
same
thing
occurs
in
literature
with
the
versifiers
and
rhetoricians
of
the
latin
decadence
with
the
sensual
and
declamatory
playwrights
closing
the
bright
period
of
the
english
drama
and
with
the
manufacturers
of
sonnets
puns
witticisms
and
bombast
of
the
italian
decline
among
these
i
will
cite
two
striking
examples
the
first
is
the
decline
of
sculpture
and
painting
in
antiquity
of
which
you
obtain
a
vivid
impression
by
visiting
pompeii
and
afterwards
ravenna
at
pompeii
the
painting
and
sculpture
belong
to
the
first
century
of
the
present
era
at
ravenna
the
mosaics
are
of
the
sixth
century
about
the
times
of
the
emperor
justinian
in
this
interval
of
five
centuries
art
becomes
irremediably
corrupt
and
its
degeneracy
is
wholly
due
to
the
neglect
of
the
living
model
in
the
first
century
the
pagan
manners
and
tastes
of
the
still
existed
men
wore
their
vestments
loose
and
cast
them
off
easily
frequented
the
baths
exercised
in
a
state
of
nudity
witnessed
the
combats
of
the
circus
ever
contemplating
sympathetically
and
intelligently
the
active
movements
of
the
living
body
their
sculptors
and
painters
surrounded
by
nude
and
forms
were
capable
of
reproducing
them
accordingly
you
will
see
on
the
walls
of
pompeii
in
the
little
oratories
and
in
the
inner
courts
beautiful
dancing
females
spirited
supple
young
heroes
with
manly
chests
agile
feet
every
posture
and
form
of
the
body
rendered
with
an
ease
and
accuracy
to
which
the
most
elaborate
study
of
the
present
day
can
not
attain
during
the
following
five
hundred
years
everything
gradually
changes
pagan
manners
the
use
of
the
and
the
love
of
the
nude
disappear
the
body
is
no
longer
exposed
but
concealed
under
complicated
drapery
and
under
a
display
of
lace
purple
and
oriental
magnificence
people
no
longer
esteem
the
wrestler
and
the
youthful
gymnast
but
the
eunuch
the
scribe
the
monk
and
the
woman
asceticism
gains
ground
and
with
it
a
love
for
listless
reverie
hollow
disputation
scribbling
and
wrangling
the
babblers
of
the
lower
empire
replace
the
valiant
greek
athletes
and
the
hardy
combatants
of
rome
by
degrees
the
knowledge
and
study
of
the
living
model
are
interdicted
people
have
discarded
it
their
eyes
rest
only
on
the
works
of
ancient
masters
and
they
copy
these
soon
copies
are
only
made
of
copies
and
again
copies
of
these
so
that
each
generation
recedes
a
step
from
the
original
type
the
artist
ceases
to
have
his
own
idea
and
his
own
feeling
and
becomes
a
copying
machine
the
fathers
declare
that
he
must
invent
nothing
but
must
adhere
to
lineaments
prescribed
by
tradition
and
sanctioned
by
authority
this
separation
of
the
artist
from
the
living
model
brings
art
to
the
condition
in
which
you
see
it
at
ravenna
at
the
end
of
five
centuries
artists
can
only
represent
man
in
two
ways
seated
and
standing
other
attitudes
are
too
difficult
and
are
beyond
their
capacity
hands
and
feet
appear
rigid
as
if
fractured
the
folds
of
drapery
are
wooden
figures
seem
to
be
mannikins
and
heads
are
invaded
by
the
eyes
art
is
like
an
invalid
sinking
under
a
mortal
consumption
it
is
languishing
and
about
to
expire
in
a
different
branch
of
art
amongst
ourselves
and
in
a
neighboring
century
we
find
again
a
similar
decline
and
brought
about
by
similar
causes
in
the
age
of
louis
literature
attained
to
a
perfect
style
to
a
purity
to
a
precision
to
a
sobriety
of
which
we
have
no
example
dramatic
art
especially
created
a
language
and
a
style
of
versification
deemed
by
all
europe
a
masterpiece
of
the
human
intellect
this
is
due
to
the
fact
of
writers
finding
their
models
around
them
and
constantly
observing
them
the
language
of
louis
xiv
was
perfect
displaying
a
dignity
eloquence
and
gravity
truly
royal
we
know
by
the
letters
despatches
and
memoirs
of
the
court
personages
of
that
time
that
an
aristocratic
tone
sustained
elegance
propriety
of
terms
dignified
manners
and
the
art
of
correct
speaking
were
as
common
to
courtiers
as
to
monarch
so
that
the
writer
frequenting
their
society
had
but
to
draw
on
his
memory
and
experience
in
order
to
obtain
the
very
best
materials
of
his
art
footnote
ἔφηβος
iii
is
this
true
in
every
particular
and
must
we
conclude
that
absolutely
exact
imitation
is
the
end
of
art
if
this
were
so
gentlemen
absolutely
exact
imitation
would
produce
the
finest
works
but
in
fact
it
is
not
so
in
sculpture
for
instance
casting
is
the
process
by
which
a
faithful
and
minute
impression
of
a
model
is
obtained
and
certainly
a
good
cast
is
not
equal
to
a
good
statue
again
and
in
another
domain
photography
is
the
art
which
completely
reproduces
with
lines
and
tints
on
a
flat
surface
without
possible
mistake
the
forms
and
modelling
of
the
object
imitated
photography
is
undoubtedly
a
useful
auxiliary
to
painting
and
is
sometimes
tastefully
employed
by
cultivated
and
intelligent
men
but
after
all
no
one
thinks
of
comparing
it
with
painting
and
finally
as
a
last
illustration
if
it
were
true
that
exact
imitation
is
the
supreme
aim
of
art
let
me
ask
what
would
be
the
best
tragedy
the
best
comedy
the
best
drama
a
stenographic
report
of
a
criminal
trial
every
word
of
which
is
faithfully
recorded
it
is
clear
however
that
if
we
sometimes
encounter
in
it
flashes
of
nature
and
occasional
outbursts
of
sentiment
these
are
but
veins
of
pure
metal
in
a
mass
of
worthless
dross
it
may
furnish
a
writer
with
materials
for
his
art
but
it
does
not
constitute
a
work
of
art
some
may
possibly
say
that
photography
casting
and
stenography
are
mechanical
processes
and
that
we
ought
to
leave
mechanism
out
of
the
question
and
accordingly
limit
our
comparisons
to
man
work
let
us
therefore
select
works
by
artists
conspicuous
for
minute
fidelity
there
is
a
canvas
in
the
louvre
by
denner
this
artist
worked
microscopically
taking
four
years
to
finish
a
portrait
nothing
in
his
heads
is
overlooked
the
finest
lines
and
wrinkles
the
faintly
mottled
surface
of
the
cheeks
the
black
specks
scattered
over
the
nose
the
bluish
flush
of
imperceptible
veins
meandering
under
the
skin
nor
the
reflection
of
objects
in
the
vicinity
on
the
eye
we
are
struck
with
astonishment
this
head
is
a
perfect
illusion
it
seems
to
project
out
of
the
frame
such
success
and
such
patience
are
unparalleled
substantially
however
a
broad
sketch
by
van
dyck
is
a
hundredfold
more
powerful
beside
neither
in
painting
nor
in
any
other
art
are
prizes
awarded
to
deceptions
a
second
and
stronger
proof
that
exact
imitation
is
not
the
end
of
art
is
to
be
found
in
this
fact
that
certain
arts
are
purposely
inexact
there
is
sculpture
for
instance
a
statue
is
generally
of
one
color
either
of
bronze
or
of
marble
and
again
the
eyes
are
without
eyeballs
it
is
just
this
uniformity
of
tint
and
this
modification
of
moral
expression
which
completes
its
beauty
examine
corresponding
works
in
which
imitation
is
pushed
to
extremity
the
churches
of
naples
and
spain
contain
draped
statues
colored
saints
in
actual
monastic
garb
with
yellow
earthy
skins
suitable
to
ascetics
and
bleeding
hands
and
wounded
sides
characteristic
of
the
martyred
alongside
of
these
appear
madonnas
in
royal
robes
in
festive
dresses
and
in
bright
silks
crowned
with
diadems
wearing
precious
necklaces
brilliant
ribbons
and
magnificent
laces
and
with
rosy
complexions
glittering
eyes
and
eyeballs
formed
of
carbuncles
by
this
excess
of
literal
imitation
the
artist
gives
no
pleasure
but
repugnance
often
disgust
and
sometimes
horror
it
is
the
same
in
literature
the
best
half
of
dramatic
poetry
every
classic
greek
and
french
drama
and
the
greater
part
of
spanish
and
english
dramas
far
from
literally
copying
ordinary
conversation
intentionally
modify
human
speech
each
of
these
dramatic
poets
makes
his
characters
speak
in
verse
casting
their
dialogue
in
rhythm
and
often
in
rhyme
is
this
modification
prejudicial
to
the
work
far
from
it
one
of
the
great
works
of
the
age
the
iphigenia
of
goethe
which
was
at
first
written
in
prose
and
afterwards
in
verse
affords
abundant
evidence
of
this
it
is
beautiful
in
prose
but
in
verse
what
a
difference
the
modification
of
ordinary
language
in
the
introduction
of
rhythm
and
metre
evidently
gives
to
this
work
its
incomparable
accent
that
calm
sublimity
that
broad
sustained
tragic
tone
which
elevates
the
spirit
above
the
low
level
of
common
life
and
brings
before
the
eye
the
heroes
of
ancient
days
that
lost
race
of
primitive
souls
and
among
them
the
august
virgin
interpreter
of
the
gods
custodian
of
the
laws
and
the
benefactress
of
mankind
in
whom
is
concentrated
whatever
is
noble
and
good
in
human
nature
in
order
to
glorify
our
species
and
renew
the
inspiration
of
our
hearts
iv
it
is
essential
then
to
closely
imitate
something
in
an
object
but
not
everything
we
have
now
to
discover
what
imitation
should
be
applied
to
anticipating
an
answer
to
this
i
reply
to
the
relationships
and
mutual
dependence
of
parts
excuse
this
abstract
definition
i
will
make
my
meaning
clearer
to
you
imagine
yourselves
before
a
living
model
man
or
woman
with
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
twice
the
dimensions
of
your
hand
on
which
to
copy
it
certainly
you
can
not
be
expected
to
reproduce
the
magnitude
of
the
limbs
for
your
paper
is
too
small
nor
can
you
be
expected
to
reproduce
their
color
for
you
have
only
black
and
white
to
work
with
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
reproduce
their
and
first
the
proportions
that
is
to
say
the
relationships
of
magnitude
if
the
head
is
of
a
certain
length
the
body
must
be
so
many
times
longer
than
the
head
the
arm
of
a
length
equally
dependent
on
that
and
the
leg
the
same
and
so
on
with
the
other
members
again
you
are
required
to
reproduce
forms
or
the
relationships
of
position
this
or
that
curve
oval
angle
or
sinuosity
in
the
model
must
be
repeated
in
the
copy
by
a
line
of
the
same
nature
in
short
your
object
is
to
reproduce
the
aggregate
of
relationships
by
which
the
parts
are
linked
together
and
nothing
else
it
is
not
the
simple
corporeal
appearance
that
you
have
to
give
but
the
of
the
whole
body
suppose
in
like
manner
you
are
contemplating
some
actual
character
some
scene
in
real
life
high
or
low
and
you
are
asked
to
furnish
a
description
of
it
to
do
this
you
have
your
eyes
your
ears
your
memory
and
perhaps
a
pencil
to
dot
down
five
or
six
notes
no
great
means
but
ample
for
your
purpose
what
is
expected
of
you
is
not
to
record
every
word
and
motion
all
the
actions
of
the
personage
or
of
the
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
that
are
figured
before
you
but
as
before
to
note
proportions
connections
and
relationships
you
are
expected
in
the
first
place
to
keep
exactly
the
proportion
of
the
actions
of
the
personage
in
other
words
to
give
prominence
to
ambitious
acts
if
he
is
ambitious
to
avaricious
acts
if
he
is
avaricious
and
to
violent
acts
if
he
is
violent
after
this
to
observe
the
reciprocal
connection
of
these
same
acts
that
is
to
say
to
provoke
one
reply
by
another
to
originate
a
resolution
a
sentiment
an
idea
by
an
idea
a
sentiment
a
preceding
resolution
and
moreover
by
the
actual
condition
of
the
personage
in
addition
to
that
still
by
the
general
character
bestowed
on
him
in
short
in
the
literary
effort
as
in
the
pictorial
effort
it
is
important
to
transcribe
not
the
visible
outlines
of
persons
and
events
but
the
aggregate
of
their
relationships
and
interdependencies
that
is
to
say
their
logic
as
a
general
rule
therefore
whatever
interests
us
in
a
real
personage
and
which
we
entreat
the
artist
to
extract
and
render
is
his
outward
or
inward
logic
in
other
terms
his
structure
composition
and
action
we
have
here
as
you
perceive
corrected
the
first
definition
given
it
is
not
cancelled
but
purified
we
have
discovered
a
more
elevated
character
for
art
which
thus
becomes
intellectual
and
not
mechanical
does
this
suffice
us
do
we
find
works
of
art
simply
confined
to
a
reproduction
of
the
relationships
of
parts
by
no
means
for
the
greatest
schools
are
justly
those
in
which
actual
relationships
are
most
modified
consider
for
example
the
italian
school
in
its
greatest
artist
michael
angelo
and
in
order
to
give
precision
to
our
ideas
let
us
recall
his
principal
work
the
four
marble
statues
surmounting
the
tomb
of
the
medicis
at
florence
those
of
you
who
have
not
seen
the
originals
are
at
least
familiar
with
copies
of
them
in
the
figures
of
these
men
and
especially
in
the
reclining
females
sleeping
or
waking
the
proportions
of
the
parts
are
certainly
not
the
same
as
in
real
personages
similar
figures
exist
nowhere
even
in
italy
you
will
see
there
young
handsome
men
peasants
with
bright
eyes
and
a
fierce
expression
academy
models
with
firm
muscles
and
a
proud
bearing
but
neither
in
a
village
nor
at
festivities
nor
in
the
studios
of
italy
or
elsewhere
at
the
present
time
or
in
the
sixteenth
century
does
any
real
man
or
woman
resemble
the
indignant
heroes
and
the
colossal
despairing
virgins
which
this
great
artist
has
placed
before
us
in
this
funereal
chapel
michael
angelo
found
these
types
in
his
own
genius
and
in
his
own
heart
in
order
to
create
them
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
soul
of
a
recluse
of
a
meditative
man
of
a
lover
of
justice
the
soul
of
an
impassioned
and
generous
nature
bewildered
in
the
midst
of
enervated
and
corrupt
beings
amidst
treachery
and
oppression
before
the
inevitable
triumph
of
tyranny
and
injustice
under
the
ruins
of
liberty
and
of
nationality
himself
threatened
with
death
feeling
that
if
he
lived
it
was
only
by
favor
and
perhaps
only
by
a
short
respite
incapable
of
sycophancy
and
of
submission
taking
refuge
entirely
in
that
art
by
which
in
the
silence
of
servitude
his
great
heart
and
his
great
despair
still
spoke
he
wrote
on
the
pedestal
of
his
sleeping
statue
sleep
is
sweet
and
yet
more
sweet
is
it
to
be
of
stone
while
shame
and
misery
last
fortunate
am
i
not
to
see
not
to
feel
forbear
to
arouse
me
ah
speak
low
this
is
the
sentiment
which
revealed
to
him
such
forms
to
express
it
he
has
changed
the
ordinary
proportions
he
has
lengthened
the
trunk
and
the
limbs
twisted
the
torso
upon
the
hips
hollowed
out
the
sockets
of
the
eyes
furrowed
the
forehead
with
wrinkles
similar
to
the
lion
frowning
brow
raised
mountains
of
muscles
on
the
shoulder
ridged
the
spine
with
tendons
and
so
fastened
the
vertebras
that
it
resembles
the
links
of
an
iron
chain
strained
to
their
utmost
tension
and
about
to
break
let
us
consider
in
like
manner
the
flemish
school
and
in
this
school
the
great
fleming
rubens
and
one
of
the
most
striking
of
his
works
the
kermesse
in
this
work
no
more
than
in
those
of
michael
angelo
will
you
find
an
imitation
of
ordinary
proportions
visit
flanders
and
observe
the
types
of
mankind
about
you
even
at
feastings
and
revellings
such
as
the
fêtes
of
gayant
antwerp
and
other
places
you
will
see
people
eating
much
and
drinking
more
serenely
smoking
cool
phlegmatic
bodies
and
with
massive
irregular
features
strongly
resembling
the
figures
of
teniers
as
to
the
splendid
brutes
of
the
kermesse
you
meet
nothing
like
them
rubens
certainly
found
them
elsewhere
after
the
horrible
religious
wars
this
rich
country
of
flanders
so
long
devastated
finally
attained
peace
and
civil
security
the
soil
is
so
good
and
the
people
so
prudent
comfort
and
prosperity
returned
almost
at
once
everybody
enjoyed
this
new
prosperity
and
abundance
the
contrast
between
the
past
and
the
present
led
to
the
indulgence
of
rude
and
carnal
instincts
let
loose
like
horses
and
cattle
after
long
privation
in
fresh
green
fields
abounding
in
the
richest
pasture
rubens
himself
was
sensible
of
them
and
the
poetry
of
gross
sumptuous
living
of
satisfied
and
redundant
flesh
of
brutal
inordinate
found
a
ready
outlet
in
the
shameless
sensualities
and
voluptuous
ruddiness
in
the
whiteness
and
freshness
of
the
nudities
of
which
he
was
so
prodigal
in
order
to
express
all
this
in
the
kermesse
he
has
expanded
the
trunk
enlarged
the
thighs
twisted
the
loins
deepened
the
redness
of
the
cheeks
dishevelled
the
hair
kindled
in
the
eyes
a
flame
of
savage
unbridled
desire
unloosed
the
demons
of
disorder
in
the
shape
of
shattered
glasses
overturned
tables
holdings
and
kissings
a
perfect
orgie
and
the
most
extraordinary
culmination
of
human
bestiality
ever
portrayed
upon
canvas
these
two
examples
show
you
that
the
artist
in
modifying
the
relationships
of
parts
modifies
them
understandingly
purposely
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
apparent
the
of
the
object
and
consequently
its
leading
idea
according
to
his
conception
of
it
this
phrase
gentlemen
requires
attention
this
is
what
philosophers
call
the
of
things
and
because
of
this
they
say
that
it
is
the
aim
of
art
to
manifest
the
of
things
we
will
not
retain
this
term
essence
which
is
technical
but
simply
state
that
it
is
the
aim
of
art
to
manifest
a
predominant
character
some
salient
principal
quality
some
important
point
of
view
some
essential
condition
of
being
in
the
object
we
here
approach
the
true
definition
of
art
and
accordingly
need
to
be
perfectly
clear
we
must
insist
on
and
precisely
define
essential
character
i
would
premise
at
once
that
it
is
quality
from
which
all
others
or
at
least
most
other
qualities
are
derived
according
to
definite
grant
me
again
this
abstract
definition
a
few
illustrations
will
make
it
plain
to
you
the
essential
character
of
a
lion
giving
him
his
rank
in
the
classifications
of
natural
history
is
that
of
a
great
nearly
all
his
traits
whether
physical
or
moral
as
i
am
about
to
prove
to
you
are
derived
from
this
trait
as
their
first
there
are
physical
traits
his
teeth
move
like
shears
he
has
a
jaw
constructed
to
tear
and
to
crush
and
necessarily
for
being
carnivorous
he
has
to
nourish
himself
with
and
prey
upon
living
game
in
order
to
manoeuvre
this
formidable
instrument
he
requires
enormous
muscles
and
for
their
insertion
temporal
sockets
of
proportionate
size
add
to
the
feet
other
instruments
the
terrible
contractile
claws
the
quick
step
on
the
extremity
of
the
toes
a
terrible
elasticity
of
the
thighs
acting
like
a
powerful
spring
and
eyes
that
see
best
at
night
because
night
is
the
best
a
naturalist
pointing
to
a
lion
skeleton
once
said
to
me
there
is
a
jaw
mounted
on
four
paws
the
moral
points
of
the
lion
are
likewise
in
harmony
at
first
there
is
the
sanguinary
instinct
the
craving
for
fresh
flesh
and
a
repugnance
for
every
other
food
next
the
strength
and
the
nervous
excitement
through
which
the
lion
concentrates
an
enormous
amount
of
force
at
the
instant
of
attack
and
defence
and
on
the
other
hand
his
somniferous
habits
the
grave
sombre
inertia
of
moments
of
repose
and
the
long
yawnings
after
the
excitement
of
the
chase
all
these
traits
are
derived
from
his
carnivorous
character
and
on
this
account
we
call
it
his
essential
character
let
us
now
consider
a
more
difficult
case
that
of
an
entire
country
with
its
innumerable
details
of
structure
aspect
and
cultivation
its
plants
animals
inhabitants
and
towns
as
for
example
the
low
countries
the
essential
character
of
this
region
is
its
formation
that
is
to
say
a
formation
due
to
vast
quantifies
of
earth
brought
down
by
streams
and
deposited
about
their
mouths
from
this
single
term
spring
an
infinity
of
peculiarities
summing
up
the
entire
nature
of
the
country
not
only
its
physical
outlines
what
it
is
in
itself
but
again
the
intellectual
moral
and
physical
qualities
of
its
inhabitants
and
of
their
works
at
first
in
the
inanimate
world
come
its
moist
and
fertile
plains
the
necessary
consequence
of
numerous
broad
rivers
and
vast
deposits
of
productive
soil
these
plains
are
always
green
because
broad
tranquil
and
sluggish
streams
and
the
innumerable
canals
so
easily
constructed
in
soft
flat
ground
maintain
perennial
verdure
you
can
readily
imagine
and
on
purely
rational
principles
the
aspect
of
such
a
country
a
dull
rainy
sky
constantly
streaked
with
showers
and
even
on
fine
days
veiled
as
if
by
gauze
with
light
vapory
clouds
rising
from
the
wet
surface
forming
a
transparent
dome
an
airy
tissue
of
delicate
snowy
fleeces
over
the
broad
verdant
expanse
stretching
out
of
sight
and
rounded
to
the
distant
horizon
in
the
animated
kingdom
these
numerous
luxuriant
pastures
attract
countless
herds
of
cattle
who
recline
tranquilly
on
the
grass
or
ruminate
over
their
cud
and
dot
the
flat
green
sward
with
innumerable
spots
of
white
yellow
and
black
hence
the
rich
stores
of
milk
and
meat
which
added
to
the
grains
and
vegetables
raised
on
this
prolific
soil
furnish
its
inhabitants
with
cheap
and
abundant
supplies
of
food
it
might
well
be
said
that
in
this
country
water
makes
grass
grass
makes
cattle
cattle
make
cheese
butter
and
meat
and
all
these
with
beer
make
the
inhabitant
indeed
out
of
this
fat
living
and
out
of
this
physical
organization
saturated
with
moisture
spring
the
phlegmatic
temperament
the
regular
habits
the
tranquil
mind
and
nerves
the
capacity
to
take
life
easily
and
prudently
unbroken
contentment
and
love
of
and
consequently
the
reign
of
cleanliness
and
the
perfection
of
comfort
these
consequences
extend
so
far
as
even
to
affect
the
aspect
of
towns
in
an
alluvial
country
there
is
no
stone
building
material
consists
of
bricks
and
tiles
rains
being
frequent
and
heavy
roofs
are
very
sloping
and
as
dampness
lasts
a
long
time
their
fronts
are
painted
and
varnished
a
flemish
town
therefore
is
a
of
brown
or
red
edifices
always
neat
occasionally
glittering
and
with
pointed
gables
here
and
there
rises
an
old
church
constructed
of
shingle
or
of
rubble
streets
in
the
best
of
order
run
between
two
scrupulously
clean
lines
of
sidewalk
in
holland
the
sidewalks
are
laid
in
brick
frequently
intermingled
with
coarse
porcelain
domestics
may
be
seen
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
on
their
knees
cleaning
them
off
with
cloths
cast
your
eyes
through
the
dazzling
enter
a
decked
with
green
branches
with
its
floor
powdered
with
sand
constantly
renewed
visit
the
taverns
brightly
painted
where
rows
of
casks
display
their
brown
rotund
sides
and
where
the
rich
yellow
beer
foams
up
out
of
glasses
covered
with
quaint
devices
in
all
these
details
of
common
life
in
all
these
signs
of
inward
contentment
and
enduring
prosperity
you
detect
the
effects
of
the
great
underlying
characteristic
which
is
stamped
upon
the
climate
and
the
soil
upon
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
the
animal
kingdom
upon
man
and
his
works
upon
society
and
the
individual
through
these
innumerable
effects
you
judge
of
the
importance
of
this
essential
character
it
is
this
which
art
must
bring
forward
into
proper
light
and
if
this
task
devolves
upon
art
it
is
because
nature
fails
to
accomplish
it
in
nature
this
essential
character
is
simply
dominant
it
is
the
aim
of
art
to
render
it
predominant
it
moulds
real
objects
but
it
does
not
mould
them
completely
its
action
is
restricted
impeded
by
the
intervention
of
other
causes
its
impression
on
objects
bearing
its
stamp
is
not
sufficiently
strong
to
be
clearly
visible
man
is
sensible
of
this
deficiency
and
to
remove
it
he
has
invented
art
let
us
again
take
up
rubens
kermesse
these
blooming
merry
wives
these
roystering
drunkards
these
busts
and
visages
of
burly
unbridled
brutes
probably
found
counterparts
in
the
carousals
of
the
day
and
exuberant
nature
aimed
at
producing
such
gross
forms
and
such
coarse
manners
but
she
only
half
accomplished
her
task
other
causes
intervened
to
stay
this
excess
of
a
carnal
jovial
energy
there
is
at
first
poverty
in
the
best
of
times
and
in
the
best
countries
many
people
have
not
enough
to
eat
and
fasting
at
least
partial
abstinence
misery
and
bad
air
all
the
accompaniments
of
indigence
diminish
the
development
and
boisterousness
of
native
brutality
a
suffering
man
is
not
so
strong
and
more
sober
religion
law
police
regulations
and
habits
due
to
steady
labor
operate
in
the
same
direction
education
does
its
part
out
of
a
hundred
subjects
who
under
favorable
conditions
might
have
furnished
rubens
with
models
only
five
or
six
perhaps
could
be
of
any
service
to
him
suppose
now
that
these
five
or
six
figures
in
the
actual
festivities
which
he
might
have
seen
were
lost
in
a
crowd
of
people
more
or
less
indifferent
and
common
consider
again
that
at
the
moment
they
came
under
his
eye
they
exhibited
neither
the
attitude
the
expression
the
gestures
the
abandonment
the
costume
or
the
disorder
requisite
to
make
this
teeming
excitement
apparent
through
all
these
nature
called
art
to
its
aid
she
could
not
clearly
distinguish
the
character
it
was
necessary
that
the
artist
should
supplement
her
thus
is
it
with
every
superior
work
of
art
while
raphael
was
painting
his
galatea
he
wrote
that
beautiful
women
being
scarce
he
was
following
a
conception
of
his
own
this
means
that
looking
at
human
nature
from
a
certain
point
of
view
its
repose
its
felicity
its
gracious
and
dignified
sweetness
he
found
no
living
model
to
express
it
satisfactorily
the
peasant
or
laboring
girl
who
posed
for
him
had
hands
deformed
by
work
feet
spoiled
by
their
covering
and
eyes
disordered
by
shame
or
demoralized
by
her
calling
his
fornarina
has
drooping
shoulders
a
meagre
arm
above
the
elbow
a
hard
and
contracted
expression
if
he
painted
her
in
the
farnesini
palace
he
completely
transformed
her
developing
a
character
in
his
painted
figure
of
which
the
real
figure
only
contributed
parts
and
suggestions
thus
the
province
of
a
work
of
art
is
to
render
the
essential
character
or
at
least
some
capital
quality
the
predominance
of
which
must
be
made
as
perceptible
as
possible
in
order
to
accomplish
this
the
artist
must
suppress
whatever
conceals
it
select
whatever
manifests
it
correct
every
detail
by
which
it
is
enfeebled
and
recast
those
in
which
it
is
neutralized
let
us
no
longer
consider
works
but
artists
that
is
to
say
the
way
in
which
artists
feel
invent
and
produce
you
will
find
it
consistent
with
the
foregoing
conception
of
the
work
of
art
there
is
one
gift
indispensable
to
all
artists
no
study
no
degree
of
patience
supplies
its
place
if
it
is
wanting
in
them
they
are
nothing
but
copyists
and
mechanics
in
confronting
objects
the
artist
must
experience
the
character
of
an
object
strikes
him
and
the
effect
of
this
sensation
is
a
strong
peculiar
impression
in
other
words
when
a
man
is
born
with
talent
his
perceptions
or
at
least
a
certain
class
of
perceptions
are
delicate
and
quick
he
naturally
seizes
and
distinguishes
with
a
sure
and
watchful
tact
relationships
and
shades
at
one
time
the
plaintive
or
heroic
sense
in
a
sequence
of
sounds
at
another
the
listlessness
or
stateliness
of
an
attitude
and
again
the
richness
or
sobriety
of
two
complimentary
or
contiguous
colors
through
this
faculty
he
penetrates
to
the
very
heart
of
things
and
seems
to
be
more
than
other
men
this
sensation
moreover
so
keen
and
so
personal
is
not
inactive
by
a
the
whole
nervous
and
thinking
machinery
is
affected
by
it
man
involuntarily
expresses
his
emotions
the
body
makes
signs
its
attitude
becomes
mimetic
he
is
obliged
to
figure
externally
his
conception
of
an
object
the
voice
seeks
imitative
inflections
the
tongue
finds
pictorial
terms
unforeseen
forms
a
figurative
inventive
exaggerated
style
under
the
force
of
the
original
impulse
the
active
brain
recasts
and
transforms
the
object
now
to
illumine
and
ennoble
it
now
to
distort
and
grotesquely
pervert
it
in
the
free
sketch
as
in
the
violent
caricature
you
readily
detect
with
poetic
temperaments
the
ascendency
of
involuntary
impressions
familiarize
yourselves
with
the
great
artists
and
great
authors
of
your
century
study
the
sketches
designs
diaries
and
correspondence
of
the
old
masters
and
you
will
again
everywhere
find
the
same
inward
process
we
may
adorn
it
with
beautiful
names
we
may
call
it
genius
or
inspiration
which
is
right
and
proper
but
if
you
wish
to
define
it
precisely
you
must
always
verify
therein
the
vivid
spontaneous
sensation
which
groups
together
the
train
of
accessory
ideas
master
fashion
metamorphose
and
employ
them
in
order
to
become
manifest
we
have
now
arrived
at
a
definition
of
a
work
of
art
let
us
for
a
moment
cast
our
eyes
backward
and
review
the
road
we
have
passed
over
we
have
by
degrees
arrived
at
a
conception
of
art
more
and
more
elevated
and
consequently
more
and
more
exact
at
first
we
thought
that
the
object
of
art
was
to
sensible
then
separating
material
from
intellectual
imitation
we
found
that
what
it
desired
to
reproduce
in
sensible
appearances
is
the
of
parts
finally
remarking
that
relationships
are
and
ought
to
be
modified
in
order
to
obtain
the
highest
results
of
art
we
proved
that
if
we
study
the
relationships
of
parts
it
is
make
predominant
an
essential
no
one
of
these
definitions
destroys
its
antecedent
but
each
corrects
and
defines
it
we
are
consequently
able
now
to
combine
them
and
by
subordinating
the
inferior
to
the
superior
thus
to
sum
up
the
result
of
our
labor
the
end
of
a
work
of
art
is
to
manifest
some
essential
or
salient
character
consequently
some
important
idea
clearer
and
more
completely
than
is
attainable
from
real
objects
art
accomplishes
this
end
by
employing
a
group
of
connected
parts
the
relationships
of
which
it
systematically
modifies
in
the
three
imitative
arts
of
sculpture
painting
and
poetry
these
groups
correspond
to
real
objects
footnote
see
the
two
portraits
of
the
fornarina
in
the
sciarra
and
the
borghese
palaces
vi
that
established
gentlemen
we
see
on
examining
the
different
parts
of
this
definition
that
the
first
is
essential
and
the
second
accessory
an
aggregate
of
connected
parts
is
necessary
in
all
art
which
the
artist
may
modify
so
as
to
portray
character
but
in
every
art
it
is
not
necessary
that
this
aggregate
should
correspond
with
real
objects
it
is
sufficient
that
it
exists
if
we
therefore
meet
with
aggregates
of
connected
parts
which
are
not
imitations
of
real
objects
there
will
be
arts
which
will
not
have
imitation
for
their
point
of
view
this
is
the
case
and
it
is
thus
that
architecture
and
music
are
born
in
short
besides
connections
proportions
moral
and
organic
dependencies
which
the
three
imitative
arts
copy
there
are
mathematical
relationships
which
the
two
others
imitating
nothing
combine
let
us
at
first
consider
the
mathematical
relationships
perceived
by
the
sense
of
sight
magnitudes
sensible
to
the
eye
may
form
amongst
each
other
aggregates
of
parts
connected
by
mathematical
laws
for
instance
a
piece
of
wood
or
stone
may
have
geometrical
form
that
of
a
cube
a
cone
a
cylinder
or
a
sphere
which
establishes
regular
relationships
of
distance
between
the
different
points
of
its
outline
furthermore
its
dimensions
may
be
quantities
mutually
related
in
simple
proportions
which
the
eye
can
seize
readily
height
may
be
two
three
or
four
times
greater
than
thickness
or
breadth
this
constitutes
a
second
series
of
mathematical
relationships
finally
many
of
these
pieces
of
wood
or
stone
may
be
placed
symmetrically
on
the
top
or
by
the
side
of
each
other
according
to
distances
and
angles
mathematically
combined
architecture
is
established
on
this
aggregate
of
connected
parts
an
architect
conceiving
some
dominant
character
either
serenity
simplicity
strength
or
elegance
as
formerly
in
greece
or
rome
or
the
strange
the
varied
the
infinite
the
fantastic
as
in
gothic
times
may
select
and
combine
connections
proportions
dimensions
forms
and
positions
in
short
the
relationships
of
materials
that
is
to
say
certain
visible
magnitudes
in
such
a
way
as
to
display
the
character
aimed
at
by
the
side
of
magnitudes
perceived
by
sight
there
are
magnitudes
perceived
by
the
hearing
i
mean
the
velocities
of
sonorous
vibrations
and
these
vibrations
being
magnitudes
may
also
form
aggregates
of
parts
connected
by
mathematical
laws
in
the
first
place
as
you
are
aware
a
musical
sound
is
composed
of
continuous
vibrations
of
equal
velocity
and
this
equality
already
places
between
them
a
mathematical
relationship
in
the
second
place
two
sounds
being
given
the
second
may
be
composed
of
vibrations
two
three
or
four
times
the
rapidity
of
the
first
accordingly
there
is
between
these
two
sounds
a
mathematical
relationship
which
is
figured
by
placing
them
at
an
equal
distance
from
each
other
on
the
musical
stave
if
consequently
instead
of
taking
two
we
take
a
number
of
sounds
and
place
them
at
equal
distances
we
form
a
scale
which
scale
is
the
gamut
all
the
sounds
being
thus
bound
together
according
to
their
relative
position
on
the
gamut
you
can
now
establish
these
connections
either
between
successive
or
simultaneous
sounds
the
first
order
of
sounds
constituting
melody
and
the
second
harmony
this
is
music
it
has
two
essential
parts
based
like
architecture
on
mathematical
relationships
which
the
artist
is
free
to
combine
and
modify
music
however
possesses
a
second
property
and
this
new
element
gives
it
a
peculiar
quality
and
no
ordinary
scope
besides
its
mathematical
qualities
sound
is
analogous
to
the
cry
and
by
this
title
it
directly
expresses
with
unrivalled
precision
delicacy
and
force
suffering
joy
rage
indignation
all
the
agitations
and
emotions
of
an
animated
sensitive
being
even
to
the
most
secret
and
most
subtle
gradations
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
similar
to
poetic
declamation
furnishing
a
specific
type
of
music
called
the
music
of
expression
like
that
of
gluck
and
the
germans
in
opposition
to
the
music
of
melody
that
of
rossini
and
the
italians
let
the
composer
point
of
view
be
what
it
may
the
two
styles
of
music
are
nevertheless
related
to
each
other
sounds
always
forming
aggregates
of
parts
linked
together
at
once
by
their
mathematical
relationship
and
by
the
correspondence
which
they
have
with
the
passions
and
the
various
internal
states
of
the
moral
being
the
musician
therefore
who
conceives
a
certain
salient
important
feature
of
things
let
it
be
sadness
or
joy
tender
love
or
passionate
rage
any
idea
or
sentiment
whatever
may
freely
select
and
combine
in
such
a
way
in
these
mathematical
and
moral
relationships
as
to
manifest
the
character
which
he
has
conceived
all
the
arts
are
thus
included
in
the
definition
above
presented
in
architecture
and
music
as
in
sculpture
painting
and
poetry
it
is
the
object
of
a
work
of
art
to
manifest
some
essential
character
and
to
employ
as
means
of
expression
an
aggregate
of
connected
parts
the
relationship
of
which
the
artist
combines
and
modifies
vii
now
that
we
know
the
nature
of
art
we
can
comprehend
its
importance
previously
we
were
only
sensible
of
its
effect
it
was
a
matter
of
instinct
and
not
of
reason
we
were
conscious
of
respecting
and
esteeming
art
but
were
not
qualified
to
account
for
our
respect
and
esteem
our
admiration
for
art
can
now
be
justified
and
we
can
mark
its
place
in
the
order
of
life
man
in
many
respects
is
an
animal
endeavoring
to
protect
himself
against
nature
and
against
other
men
he
is
obliged
to
provide
himself
with
food
clothing
and
shelter
and
to
defend
himself
against
climate
want
and
disease
to
do
this
he
tills
the
ground
navigates
the
sea
and
devotes
himself
to
different
industrial
and
commercial
pursuits
furthermore
he
must
perpetuate
his
species
and
secure
himself
against
the
violence
of
his
to
this
end
he
forms
families
and
states
and
establishes
magistracies
functionaries
constitutions
laws
and
armies
after
so
many
inventions
and
such
labor
he
is
not
yet
emancipated
from
his
original
condition
he
is
still
an
animal
better
fed
and
better
protected
than
other
animals
he
still
thinks
only
of
himself
and
of
his
kindred
at
this
moment
a
superior
life
dawns
on
him
that
of
contemplation
by
which
he
is
led
to
interest
himself
in
the
creative
and
permanent
causes
on
which
his
own
being
and
that
of
his
fellows
depend
in
the
leading
and
essential
characters
which
rule
each
aggregate
and
impress
their
marks
on
the
minutest
details
two
ways
are
open
to
him
for
this
purpose
the
first
is
science
by
which
analyzing
these
causes
and
these
fundamental
laws
he
expresses
them
in
abstract
terms
and
precise
formula
the
second
is
art
by
which
he
manifests
these
causes
and
these
fundamental
laws
no
longer
through
arid
definitions
inaccessible
to
the
multitude
and
only
intelligible
to
a
favored
few
but
in
a
sensible
way
appealing
not
alone
to
reason
but
also
to
the
heart
and
senses
of
the
humblest
individual
art
has
this
peculiarity
that
it
is
at
once
and
manifesting
whatever
is
most
exalted
and
manifesting
it
to
all
part
ii
on
the
production
of
the
work
of
art
i
having
investigated
the
nature
of
the
work
of
art
there
now
remains
a
study
of
the
law
of
its
production
this
law
in
general
terms
may
be
thus
expressed
work
of
art
is
determined
by
an
aggregate
which
is
the
general
state
of
the
mind
and
surrounding
i
have
stated
this
principle
in
the
foregoing
section
and
have
now
to
establish
it
this
law
rests
on
two
kinds
of
proof
the
one
that
of
experience
and
the
other
that
of
reason
the
former
consists
of
an
enumeration
of
the
many
instances
in
which
the
law
verifies
itself
some
of
these
i
have
already
presented
to
you
and
others
will
soon
follow
one
may
assert
moreover
that
no
case
is
known
to
which
the
law
is
not
applicable
it
is
strictly
so
to
those
hitherto
examined
and
not
merely
in
a
general
way
but
in
detail
not
only
to
the
growth
and
extinction
of
great
schools
but
again
to
all
the
variations
and
oscillations
to
which
art
is
subject
the
second
order
of
proof
consists
in
showing
this
dependence
to
be
not
only
rigorous
in
point
of
fact
but
again
that
it
is
so
through
necessity
we
will
accordingly
analyze
what
we
have
called
the
general
state
of
the
mind
and
surrounding
circumstances
we
shall
seek
according
to
the
ordinary
standard
of
human
nature
the
effects
which
a
like
state
must
produce
on
the
public
on
artists
and
consequently
on
works
of
art
hence
we
draw
a
forced
connection
and
a
definite
concordance
and
we
establish
a
necessary
harmony
which
we
had
observed
as
simply
fortuitous
the
second
proof
what
the
first
had
averred
ii
in
order
to
make
this
harmony
apparent
let
us
resume
a
comparison
already
of
service
to
us
that
between
a
plant
and
a
work
of
art
and
note
the
circumstances
in
which
a
plant
or
a
species
of
plant
say
the
orange
may
be
developed
and
propagated
in
a
certain
soil
let
us
suppose
all
kinds
of
grain
and
seed
borne
by
the
wind
and
sown
at
random
on
what
conditions
can
those
of
the
lorange
germinate
become
trees
blossom
yield
fruit
spread
and
cover
the
ground
with
a
numerous
family
many
favorable
circumstances
are
essential
to
this
end
and
at
first
the
soil
must
be
neither
too
light
nor
too
meagre
otherwise
the
roots
lacking
depth
and
grasp
the
tree
would
fall
at
the
first
gale
of
wind
next
the
soil
must
not
be
too
dry
otherwise
the
tree
will
wither
where
it
stands
deprived
of
the
moisture
of
springs
and
streams
moreover
the
climate
must
be
warm
or
the
tree
which
is
delicate
will
freeze
or
at
least
droop
and
never
put
forth
sprouts
the
summer
must
be
long
in
order
that
the
fruit
which
is
slow
in
ripening
may
fully
mature
and
the
winter
mild
so
that
january
frosts
may
not
blast
or
shrivel
the
oranges
that
remain
green
on
its
branches
finally
the
soil
must
not
be
too
favorable
for
other
plants
lest
the
tree
left
to
itself
might
be
stifled
by
the
competition
and
infringement
of
a
more
vigorous
vegetation
when
all
these
conditions
concur
the
little
orange
will
grow
become
mature
and
produce
others
again
to
reproduce
themselves
storms
will
undoubtedly
occur
stones
fall
and
browsing
goats
will
destroy
certain
plants
but
on
the
whole
in
spite
of
accidents
which
kill
individuals
the
species
will
be
propagated
cover
the
ground
and
in
a
few
years
display
a
nourishing
grove
of
orange
trees
all
this
is
to
be
seen
in
the
admirably
sheltered
gorges
of
southern
italy
in
the
environs
of
sorrento
and
amain
on
the
shores
of
the
gulfs
and
in
the
small
watered
valleys
freshened
by
streams
descending
from
the
mountains
and
caressed
by
the
beneficent
breezes
of
the
sea
this
concourse
of
circumstances
was
necessary
in
order
to
produce
those
beautiful
round
tops
those
lustrous
domes
of
a
bright
deep
green
those
innumerable
golden
apples
and
that
exquisite
fragrant
vegetation
which
in
makes
this
coast
the
richest
and
loveliest
of
gardens
let
us
now
reflect
on
the
manner
in
which
things
moved
in
this
example
we
have
just
observed
the
effect
of
circumstances
and
of
physical
temperature
strictly
speaking
these
have
not
produced
the
orange
the
seeds
were
given
and
these
alone
contained
the
vital
force
the
circumstances
described
however
were
necessary
in
order
that
the
plant
might
flourish
and
be
propagated
had
these
failed
the
plant
likewise
would
have
failed
accordingly
let
the
temperature
be
different
and
the
species
of
plant
will
be
different
suppose
conditions
entirely
opposite
to
those
just
mentioned
take
the
summit
of
a
mountain
swept
by
violent
winds
with
a
thin
scanty
soil
a
cold
climate
a
short
summer
and
snow
during
the
winter
not
only
will
the
orange
not
thrive
here
but
the
greater
part
of
other
trees
will
perish
of
all
the
seeds
scattered
haphazard
by
the
wind
only
one
will
survive
and
you
will
see
but
one
species
to
endure
and
be
propagated
the
only
one
adapted
to
these
severe
conditions
the
fir
and
the
pine
will
cover
the
lonely
crags
the
abrupt
precipices
and
long
rocky
ridges
with
their
stiff
colonnades
of
tall
trunks
and
vast
mantles
of
sombre
green
and
there
as
in
the
vosges
in
scotland
and
in
norway
you
may
travel
league
after
league
under
silent
arches
on
a
carpet
of
crisp
leaves
among
gnarled
roots
obstinately
clinging
to
the
rocks
the
domain
of
the
patient
energetic
plant
which
alone
subsists
under
the
incessant
attacks
of
gales
and
the
of
long
winters
we
may
accordingly
regard
temperature
and
physical
circumstances
as
a
amongst
various
species
of
trees
all
owing
a
certain
species
to
subsist
and
propagate
to
the
exclusion
more
or
less
complete
of
all
others
physical
temperature
acts
by
elimination
and
suppression
in
other
words
by
such
is
the
great
law
by
which
we
now
explain
the
origin
and
structure
of
diverse
existing
organisms
a
law
as
applicable
to
moral
as
to
physical
conditions
to
history
as
well
as
to
botany
and
zoology
to
genius
and
to
character
as
well
as
to
plant
and
to
animal
in
short
there
is
a
temperature
consisting
of
the
general
state
of
minds
and
manners
which
acts
in
the
same
way
as
the
other
properly
speaking
this
temperature
does
not
produce
artists
talent
and
genius
are
gifts
like
seeds
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
the
same
country
at
different
epochs
probably
contains
about
the
same
number
of
men
of
talent
and
of
men
of
mediocrity
we
know
in
fact
through
statistics
that
in
two
successive
generations
nearly
the
same
number
of
men
are
found
of
the
requisite
stature
for
the
conscription
and
the
same
number
of
men
too
small
for
soldiers
in
all
probability
it
is
with
minds
as
with
bodies
nature
is
a
sower
of
men
and
putting
her
hand
constantly
in
the
same
sack
distributes
nearly
the
same
quantity
the
same
quality
the
same
proportion
of
seed
but
in
these
handfuls
of
seed
which
she
scatters
as
she
strides
over
time
and
space
not
all
germinate
a
certain
moral
temperature
is
necessary
to
develop
certain
talents
if
this
is
wanting
these
prove
abortive
consequently
as
the
temperature
changes
so
will
the
species
of
talent
change
if
it
becomes
reversed
talent
will
become
reversed
and
in
general
we
may
conceive
moral
temperature
as
a
among
different
species
of
talent
allowing
only
this
or
that
species
to
develope
to
the
exclusion
more
or
less
complete
of
others
it
is
through
some
such
mechanism
that
you
see
developed
in
schools
at
certain
times
and
in
certain
countries
the
sentiment
of
the
ideal
that
of
the
real
that
of
drawing
and
that
of
color
there
is
a
prevailing
tendency
which
constitutes
the
spirit
of
the
age
talent
seeking
to
force
an
outlet
in
another
direction
finds
it
closed
and
the
force
of
the
public
mind
and
surrounding
habits
repress
and
lead
it
astray
by
imposing
on
it
a
fixed
growth
iii
the
foregoing
comparison
may
serve
you
as
a
general
indication
let
us
now
enter
into
details
and
study
the
action
of
the
moral
temperature
on
works
of
art
for
the
sake
of
greater
clearness
we
will
take
a
very
simple
case
that
of
a
certain
mental
condition
in
which
melancholy
predominates
this
supposition
is
not
arbitrary
for
such
a
condition
has
frequently
occurred
in
the
life
of
humanity
five
or
six
centuries
of
decadence
depopulation
foreign
invasion
famine
pests
and
aggravated
misery
are
amply
sufficient
to
produce
it
asia
experienced
such
a
state
of
things
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
and
europe
in
the
period
of
the
first
ten
centuries
of
our
own
era
in
times
like
these
men
lose
both
courage
and
hope
and
regard
life
as
a
burden
let
as
contemplate
the
effect
of
such
a
mental
condition
together
with
the
circumstances
which
engender
it
on
the
artists
of
an
epoch
like
this
we
admit
that
nearly
the
same
number
of
melancholy
and
joyous
temperaments
as
well
as
a
mixture
of
both
are
met
in
this
as
at
other
times
how
and
in
what
sense
does
the
prevailing
situation
effect
their
transformation
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
misfortunes
that
afflict
the
public
also
afflict
the
artist
he
is
one
of
the
flock
and
he
suffers
as
the
rest
suffer
for
example
if
invasions
of
barbarians
occur
and
pests
famines
and
calamities
of
all
sorts
prolonged
for
centuries
and
spread
over
the
entire
country
not
only
one
but
countless
miracles
would
be
necessary
to
save
him
harmless
in
the
general
inundation
on
the
contrary
it
is
probable
and
even
certain
that
he
will
have
his
share
of
public
misfortune
that
he
will
be
ruined
beaten
wounded
and
led
into
captivity
like
others
that
his
wife
children
relatives
and
friends
will
share
the
common
fate
and
that
he
will
suffer
and
be
subject
to
fears
on
their
account
as
well
as
on
his
own
during
this
flood
of
personal
misery
he
will
if
he
is
gay
become
less
gay
and
if
melancholy
still
more
melancholy
this
is
the
first
effect
of
his
social
medium
on
the
other
hand
if
the
artist
is
raised
among
melancholy
companions
the
ideas
he
receives
in
infancy
with
those
acquired
afterwards
are
melancholy
the
dominant
religion
accommodating
itself
to
the
lugubrious
order
of
things
teaches
him
that
the
earth
is
a
place
of
exile
the
world
a
life
an
evil
and
that
all
that
concerns
him
is
to
deserve
to
get
out
of
it
philosophy
forming
its
morality
according
to
the
lamentable
spectacle
of
man
degeneracy
proves
to
him
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
not
to
have
been
born
ordinary
conversation
teems
with
only
mournful
events
the
invasion
of
a
province
the
destruction
of
some
monument
the
oppression
of
the
weak
and
civil
wars
among
the
strong
daily
observation
reveals
to
him
only
images
of
discouragement
and
grief
beggars
and
cases
of
starvation
a
bridge
left
to
decay
abandoned
crumbling
houses
fields
going
to
waste
and
the
black
walls
of
dwellings
ravaged
by
fire
all
these
impressions
sink
deep
in
his
mind
from
the
first
year
of
his
life
to
the
last
incessantly
aggravating
whatever
melancholy
sentiment
arises
out
of
his
own
misfortunes
they
aggravate
him
so
much
the
more
proportionately
to
the
intensity
of
his
artistic
feeling
what
makes
him
an
artist
is
the
practice
of
imitating
the
essential
character
of
things
the
salient
points
of
objects
other
men
only
see
portions
while
he
sees
the
whole
and
the
spirit
of
them
and
as
in
this
case
the
salient
characteristic
is
melancholy
he
accordingly
perceives
nothing
else
moreover
through
this
excess
of
imagination
and
this
instinct
of
exaggeration
peculiar
to
artists
he
amplifies
and
expands
it
to
the
utmost
he
becomes
impregnated
with
it
and
charges
his
work
with
it
so
that
he
commonly
sees
and
paints
things
in
much
darker
colors
than
would
be
employed
by
his
contemporaries
it
must
be
added
also
that
he
finds
them
of
great
assistance
to
him
in
his
work
you
know
that
a
man
who
paints
or
writes
remains
not
alone
face
to
face
with
his
canvas
or
his
on
the
contrary
he
goes
out
and
talks
to
people
and
looks
about
him
he
listens
to
the
hints
of
his
friends
or
rivals
and
seeks
suggestions
in
books
and
from
surrounding
works
of
art
an
idea
resembles
a
seed
if
the
seed
requires
in
order
to
germinate
develope
and
bloom
the
nourishment
which
water
air
sun
and
soil
afford
it
the
idea
in
order
to
complete
and
shape
itself
into
form
requires
to
be
supplemented
and
aided
by
other
minds
accordingly
in
these
epochs
of
melancholy
what
sort
of
suggestions
are
other
minds
capable
of
furnishing
only
melancholy
ones
for
only
on
this
side
do
men
labor
as
their
experience
provides
them
only
with
painful
sensations
and
sentiments
they
can
only
note
the
shades
of
difference
and
record
discoveries
made
on
the
path
of
suffering
the
heart
is
the
only
field
of
observation
and
if
this
is
filled
with
sorrow
sorrow
is
all
that
men
contemplate
they
are
therefore
conscious
only
of
grief
dejection
chagrin
and
despair
if
the
artist
demands
instruction
of
them
this
is
all
the
return
they
can
make
to
seek
in
them
any
idea
or
any
information
on
the
different
kinds
or
different
expressions
of
joy
would
be
labor
lost
they
can
only
furnish
what
they
possess
for
this
reason
let
him
attempt
to
portray
happiness
cheerfulness
or
gayety
and
he
stands
alone
deprived
of
all
support
left
to
his
own
resources
and
which
in
an
isolated
man
amounts
to
nothing
his
labor
will
likewise
be
stamped
with
mediocrity
on
the
other
hand
when
he
would
paint
melancholy
sentiments
his
century
would
come
to
his
aid
he
finds
materials
prepared
for
him
by
preceding
schools
he
finds
a
art
consisting
of
known
processes
and
a
beaten
track
a
church
ceremony
a
piece
of
furniture
a
conversation
suggests
to
him
a
form
a
color
a
phrase
or
a
character
still
unknown
to
him
his
work
to
which
millions
of
unknown
have
contributed
is
all
the
more
beautiful
because
in
addition
to
his
own
labor
and
his
own
genius
it
embodies
the
labor
and
genius
of
surrounding
society
and
of
generations
that
have
gone
before
it
there
is
still
another
reason
and
the
strongest
of
all
which
draws
him
to
melancholy
subjects
it
is
that
his
work
once
exposed
to
the
public
eye
finds
appreciation
only
as
it
expresses
melancholy
ideas
men
indeed
can
only
comprehend
sentiments
analogous
to
those
they
have
themselves
experienced
other
sentiments
no
matter
how
powerfully
expressed
do
not
affect
them
the
look
with
their
eyes
but
the
heart
is
dormant
and
directly
their
eyes
are
averted
imagine
a
man
losing
his
fortune
country
children
health
and
liberty
one
manacled
in
a
dungeon
for
twenty
years
like
pellico
or
andryane
whose
spirit
by
degrees
is
changed
and
broken
and
who
becomes
melancholy
and
a
mystic
and
whose
discouragement
is
incurable
such
a
man
entertains
a
horror
of
cheerful
music
and
has
no
disposition
to
read
rabelais
if
you
place
him
before
the
merry
brutes
of
rubens
he
will
turn
aside
and
place
himself
before
the
canvases
of
rembrandt
he
will
enjoy
only
the
music
of
chopin
and
the
poetry
of
lamartine
or
heine
the
same
thing
happens
to
the
public
and
to
individuals
their
taste
depends
on
their
situation
their
sadness
gives
them
a
taste
for
melancholy
works
cheerful
productions
are
accordingly
repudiated
and
the
artist
is
censured
or
neglected
now
an
artist
composes
mostly
in
order
to
obtain
appreciation
and
applause
this
is
his
ruling
passion
hence
therefore
betides
other
causes
his
ruling
passion
added
to
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
leads
him
pushes
him
and
constantly
brings
him
back
to
the
expression
of
melancholy
and
barring
the
ways
to
him
which
would
lead
him
to
the
portrayal
of
gayety
and
happiness
through
this
series
of
obstacles
every
passage
would
be
closed
for
works
of
art
manifesting
joy
if
an
artist
overcomes
one
obstacle
he
is
arrested
by
others
if
he
meets
with
joyous
natures
he
will
be
saddened
their
personal
misfortunes
education
and
current
conversation
fill
their
minds
with
gloomy
ideas
the
artists
faculties
by
which
they
detach
and
amplify
the
leading
traits
of
objects
will
find
for
their
exercise
none
but
melancholy
ones
the
experience
and
labor
of
others
provide
them
with
suggestions
and
are
only
in
melancholy
subjects
finally
the
earnest
and
decisive
will
of
the
public
allows
them
to
produce
only
melancholy
subjects
consequently
the
class
of
artists
and
their
works
suitable
for
the
expression
of
gayety
and
joyousness
disappear
or
end
by
becoming
reduced
to
almost
nothing
consider
now
the
opposite
case
that
of
a
general
condition
of
cheerfulness
that
occurs
in
renaissance
epochs
when
order
wealth
population
comfort
prosperity
and
useful
and
beautiful
discoveries
are
constantly
increasing
by
reversing
its
terms
the
analysis
we
have
just
made
is
applicable
word
for
word
the
same
process
of
reasoning
proves
that
the
works
of
art
of
such
a
period
will
all
more
or
less
express
a
joyous
character
consider
now
an
intermediary
case
that
is
to
say
a
commingling
of
this
or
that
phase
of
joy
or
sadness
which
is
the
ordinary
condition
of
things
by
a
proper
modification
of
terras
the
analysis
is
equally
pertinent
the
same
reasoning
demonstrates
that
works
of
art
express
corresponding
combinations
and
a
corresponding
species
of
joy
and
melancholy
let
us
conclude
therefore
that
in
every
simple
or
complex
state
the
social
medium
that
is
to
say
the
general
state
of
mind
and
manners
determines
the
species
of
works
of
art
in
suffering
only
those
which
are
in
harmony
with
it
and
in
suppressing
other
species
through
a
series
of
obstacles
interposed
and
a
series
of
attacks
renewed
at
every
step
of
their
development
iv
let
us
now
leave
supposed
cases
simplified
to
give
clearness
to
the
exposition
and
take
up
real
ones
you
will
see
in
glancing
at
the
most
important
of
a
historical
series
a
verification
of
the
law
i
will
select
four
which
are
the
four
great
cycles
of
european
civilization
greek
and
roman
antiquity
the
feudal
and
christian
middle
ages
the
aristocratic
monarchies
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
industrial
democracies
of
the
present
day
directed
by
the
sciences
each
of
these
periods
has
its
own
art
or
some
department
of
art
peculiar
to
it
either
sculpture
architecture
the
drama
or
music
or
some
determined
phase
of
each
of
these
great
arts
in
every
case
a
distinct
singularly
rich
and
complete
vegetation
which
in
its
leading
features
reflects
the
principal
traits
of
the
art
and
the
nation
let
us
accordingly
consider
turn
the
different
soils
and
we
shall
that
all
produce
different
flowers
about
three
thousand
years
ago
there
appeared
on
the
shores
and
islands
of
the
ægean
sea
a
remarkably
handsome
intelligent
race
viewing
life
in
quite
a
new
way
it
did
not
allow
itself
to
be
absorbed
by
a
great
religious
conception
like
the
hindoos
and
egyptians
nor
by
a
great
social
organization
like
the
assyrians
and
persians
nor
by
great
industrial
and
commercial
usages
after
the
fashion
of
the
phoenicians
and
carthagenians
instead
of
a
theocracy
and
a
hierarchy
of
caste
and
instead
of
a
monarchy
and
a
hierarchy
of
functionaries
and
of
great
trading
and
commercial
establishments
the
men
of
that
race
had
an
invention
of
their
own
called
the
city
which
city
in
sending
forth
branches
gave
birth
to
others
of
the
same
description
one
of
these
miletus
produced
three
hundred
towns
and
colonized
the
entire
coast
of
the
black
sea
others
did
the
same
the
mediterranean
sea
being
encircled
with
a
garland
of
flourishing
cities
extending
from
cyrene
to
marseilles
along
the
gulfs
and
promontories
of
spain
italy
greece
asia
minor
and
africa
what
was
the
life
of
this
city
a
citizen
performed
but
little
manual
labor
he
was
generally
supported
by
his
subjects
and
tributaries
and
always
served
by
slaves
the
poorest
man
in
the
place
had
one
to
keep
house
for
him
athens
counted
four
for
each
citizen
and
lesser
cities
like
ægina
and
corinth
possessed
from
four
to
five
hundred
thousand
servants
of
course
abounded
the
citizen
however
needed
but
little
help
like
all
the
races
of
the
south
he
was
abstemious
a
meal
consisting
of
three
or
four
olives
a
bit
of
garlic
and
the
head
of
a
fish
his
wardrobe
consisted
of
sandals
a
small
shirt
and
a
large
mantle
like
that
of
a
shepherd
his
house
was
a
narrow
frail
tenement
into
which
robbers
could
penetrate
by
piercing
the
walls
and
which
he
only
used
for
sleeping
a
bed
and
two
or
three
beautiful
vases
were
the
principal
articles
of
furniture
the
citizen
had
few
wants
and
he
passed
the
day
in
the
open
air
how
did
he
dispose
of
his
leisure
serving
neither
king
nor
priest
he
was
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
free
and
sovereign
in
the
city
he
elected
his
own
pontiffs
and
magistrates
and
he
himself
in
turn
could
be
elected
to
sacerdotal
and
other
offices
whether
blacksmith
or
currier
he
judged
the
most
important
political
cases
in
the
tribunals
and
decided
the
gravest
of
affairs
of
state
in
the
assemblies
his
occupation
consisted
substantially
of
public
business
and
war
to
be
a
politician
and
a
soldier
was
a
part
of
his
duty
other
pursuits
were
of
little
importance
to
him
the
attention
of
a
free
man
in
his
opinion
ought
to
be
applied
to
these
two
employments
and
he
was
right
for
at
that
time
human
life
was
not
protected
as
it
is
in
ours
human
societies
had
not
acquired
the
stability
which
they
now
have
most
of
these
cities
built
and
scattered
along
the
mediterranean
shores
were
surrounded
by
barbarians
eager
to
prey
upon
them
the
citizen
was
obliged
to
be
under
arms
like
the
european
of
the
present
day
in
japan
and
in
new
zealand
if
not
gauls
libyans
samitites
and
bithynians
would
soon
have
pitched
their
camps
amid
the
ruins
of
battered
walls
and
devastated
temples
besides
all
this
these
cities
were
inimical
to
each
other
the
rights
of
war
were
atrocious
a
vanquished
city
was
often
devoted
to
destruction
a
wealthy
noted
man
might
any
day
see
his
dwelling
in
ashes
his
property
pillaged
his
wife
and
daughters
sold
to
recruit
places
of
prostitution
he
himself
and
his
sons
enslaved
would
be
buried
in
mines
or
compelled
by
the
lash
to
turn
a
mill
with
such
perils
before
him
it
is
natural
for
a
man
to
be
interested
in
affairs
of
state
and
be
qualified
for
battle
he
has
to
become
a
politician
under
penalty
of
death
ambition
however
and
love
of
glory
are
equal
stimulants
every
city
aspired
to
reduce
or
humble
every
other
city
to
acquire
vassals
to
conquer
or
to
make
profitable
the
persons
of
others
the
citizen
passed
his
life
in
the
public
thoroughfares
discussing
the
best
means
for
preserving
and
aggrandizing
his
city
canvassing
its
alliances
treaties
laws
and
constitution
now
listening
to
orators
and
again
acting
as
one
himself
up
to
the
very
moment
of
going
aboard
his
vessel
in
order
to
wage
war
in
thrace
or
in
egypt
against
other
greeks
against
the
barbarians
or
against
the
great
king
to
reach
this
point
they
had
systematized
a
peculiar
discipline
as
there
were
no
industrial
facilities
in
those
days
the
machinery
of
war
was
unknown
war
was
a
combat
between
man
and
man
consequently
the
essential
thing
to
insure
victory
was
not
to
transform
soldiers
into
marshalled
automatons
as
in
our
day
but
to
render
each
soldier
the
most
resistant
the
strongest
and
the
most
agile
body
possible
in
short
a
gladiator
capable
of
the
utmost
physical
endurance
to
this
end
sparta
which
about
the
eighth
century
gave
the
example
and
the
impulse
to
all
greece
had
a
very
complicated
and
no
less
efficacious
military
system
she
herself
was
a
camp
without
walls
situated
like
our
camps
in
kabyle
amidst
enemies
and
a
conquered
people
wholly
military
and
devoted
to
attack
and
in
order
to
have
a
perfect
military
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
splendid
race
it
was
managed
as
in
all
deformed
children
were
deprived
of
life
the
law
moreover
prescribed
the
age
for
marriage
and
selected
the
most
suitable
time
and
circumstances
for
proper
breeding
an
old
man
happening
to
have
a
young
wife
was
obliged
to
give
her
over
to
a
young
man
in
order
to
have
a
good
healthy
offspring
a
man
having
a
friend
whose
beauty
and
character
he
admired
might
give
him
the
use
of
his
wife
after
having
constituted
the
race
they
shaped
the
individual
young
men
were
enrolled
drilled
and
accustomed
to
live
in
common
like
a
troop
of
children
they
were
divided
into
two
rival
bands
who
inspected
each
other
and
fought
together
with
their
feet
and
their
fists
they
slept
in
the
open
air
bathed
in
the
cool
waters
of
the
eurotas
went
marauding
ate
sparingly
fast
and
badly
rested
on
beds
of
rushes
drank
nothing
but
water
and
endured
every
inclemency
of
climate
young
girls
exercised
in
the
same
manner
and
the
matured
were
restricted
to
almost
the
same
routine
the
rigor
of
this
antique
discipline
was
undoubtedly
less
or
was
mitigated
in
other
cities
nevertheless
with
these
mitigations
the
same
road
conducted
to
the
same
end
young
people
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
the
gymnasia
wrestling
jumping
boxing
racing
pitching
quoits
fortifying
and
rendering
supple
their
naked
muscles
it
was
their
aim
to
produce
strong
robust
bodies
the
most
beautiful
and
the
nimblest
possible
and
no
system
of
education
ever
succeeded
better
in
obtaining
them
these
peculiar
customs
of
the
greeks
gave
birth
to
peculiar
ideas
in
their
eyes
the
ideal
man
was
not
the
man
of
thought
or
a
man
of
delicate
sensibility
but
the
naked
man
the
man
of
a
fine
stock
and
growth
active
and
accomplished
in
all
physical
exercises
this
mode
of
thinking
was
manifested
by
a
variety
of
traits
in
the
first
place
whilst
the
carians
and
the
lydians
around
them
and
their
barbarian
neighbors
generally
were
ashamed
to
appear
naked
they
stripped
without
embarrassment
in
order
to
wrestle
and
run
races
the
young
girls
of
sparta
were
in
the
habit
of
exercising
almost
naked
you
will
perceive
that
gymnastic
exercises
had
suppressed
or
at
least
transformed
modesty
in
the
second
place
the
great
national
festivals
of
the
greeks
the
olympian
pythian
and
nemean
games
consisted
of
a
display
and
triumph
of
the
naked
figure
the
youth
of
the
first
families
resorted
to
these
from
all
parts
of
greece
and
from
the
remotest
grecian
colonies
they
prepared
themselves
for
them
a
long
time
beforehand
by
special
training
and
the
severest
labor
and
there
under
the
eyes
and
applause
of
the
whole
nation
stripped
of
their
clothing
they
wrestled
boxed
pitched
quoits
and
raced
on
foot
or
in
the
chariot
victories
of
this
class
which
we
of
the
present
day
leave
to
a
hercules
in
a
circus
they
regarded
as
of
the
first
importance
the
victorious
athlete
in
the
gave
his
name
to
the
olympiad
his
praises
were
chanted
by
the
greatest
poets
pindar
the
most
illustrious
lyric
poet
of
antiquity
sang
only
of
chariot
races
on
returning
to
his
native
city
the
victorious
athlete
was
received
in
triumph
and
his
strength
and
agility
became
the
pride
of
the
place
one
of
these
milo
of
crotona
who
was
invincible
at
wrestling
was
chosen
general
and
led
his
to
battle
clad
in
a
lion
skin
and
armed
with
a
club
like
hercules
to
whom
he
was
compared
it
is
related
that
a
certain
diagoras
saw
his
two
sons
crowned
on
the
same
day
and
was
carried
around
by
them
in
triumph
before
the
assembled
multitude
deeming
a
like
happiness
too
great
for
one
mortal
the
people
cried
out
to
him
die
diagoras
for
thou
canst
not
now
become
a
god
diagoras
suffocated
with
emotion
did
indeed
expire
in
the
arms
of
his
children
in
his
eyes
as
in
the
eyes
of
all
greece
to
see
his
sons
possessing
the
most
vigorous
fists
and
the
nimblest
legs
was
the
height
of
terrestrial
bliss
whether
this
be
truth
or
legend
such
a
judgment
proves
the
excessive
degree
of
admiration
entertained
by
the
greeks
for
the
perfection
of
the
human
form
on
this
account
they
were
not
afraid
to
expose
it
before
the
gods
on
solemn
occasions
they
had
a
formal
system
of
attitudes
and
actions
called
which
regulated
and
taught
them
beautiful
postures
of
the
sacred
dances
after
the
battle
of
salamis
the
tragic
poet
sophocles
then
fifteen
years
old
and
celebrated
for
his
beauty
stripped
himself
of
his
clothing
in
order
to
dance
and
chant
the
pæan
before
the
trophy
one
hundred
years
later
alexander
on
passing
through
asia
minor
to
contend
with
darius
cast
aside
his
garments
along
with
his
companions
for
the
purpose
of
honoring
the
tomb
of
achilles
with
races
but
the
greeks
went
still
further
they
considered
the
perfection
of
the
human
form
as
attesting
divinity
in
a
town
in
sicily
a
young
man
of
extraordinary
beauty
was
worshipped
and
after
death
altars
were
erected
in
his
honor
in
homer
which
is
the
grecian
bible
you
will
find
everywhere
that
the
gods
had
a
human
body
which
the
could
pierce
flowing
red
blood
instincts
passions
and
pleasures
similar
in
every
respect
to
our
own
and
to
such
an
extent
that
heroes
become
the
lovers
of
goddesses
and
gods
beget
children
of
mortal
mothers
between
olympus
and
the
earth
there
is
no
abyss
they
descend
from
and
we
ascend
to
it
if
they
surpass
us
it
is
because
they
are
exempt
from
death
because
their
wounds
heal
quicker
and
they
are
stronger
handsomer
and
happier
than
we
in
other
respects
they
eat
drink
and
quarrel
as
we
do
all
enjoying
the
same
senses
and
employing
the
same
corporeal
functions
greece
has
so
well
worked
out
its
model
of
the
beautiful
human
animal
that
it
has
made
its
idol
of
it
and
glorifies
it
on
earth
by
making
a
divinity
of
it
in
heaven
out
of
this
conception
statuary
is
born
and
we
can
mark
every
moment
of
its
growth
on
the
one
hand
an
athlete
once
crowned
was
entitled
to
a
statue
crowned
a
third
time
he
was
awarded
an
iconical
statue
that
is
to
say
an
effigy
bearing
his
portrait
on
the
other
hand
the
gods
being
only
human
forms
more
serene
and
more
perfect
than
others
it
was
natural
to
represent
them
by
statues
for
that
purpose
there
is
no
need
of
a
forced
dogma
the
marble
or
bronze
effigy
is
not
an
allegory
but
an
exact
image
it
does
not
give
to
the
god
muscles
bones
and
a
heavy
covering
which
it
has
not
it
represents
the
reclothing
of
flesh
which
covers
it
and
the
living
form
which
is
its
substance
it
suffices
in
order
to
be
a
truthful
portrait
that
it
should
be
the
most
beautiful
and
reproduce
the
immortal
calm
by
which
the
god
is
exalted
above
mortals
the
statue
is
now
blocked
out
is
the
sculptor
qualified
to
produce
it
dwell
a
moment
on
his
preparation
men
in
those
days
studied
the
body
naked
and
in
action
in
the
baths
in
the
gymnasia
in
the
sacred
dances
and
at
the
public
games
they
observed
and
preferred
such
forms
and
such
attitudes
as
denoted
vigor
health
and
activity
they
labored
with
all
their
might
to
impress
on
it
these
forms
and
to
shape
it
to
these
attitudes
for
three
or
four
hundred
years
they
were
thus
correcting
purifying
developing
their
idea
of
physical
beauty
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
finally
discovered
the
ideal
type
of
the
human
form
we
of
the
present
day
that
are
familiar
with
it
owe
our
knowledge
of
it
to
them
when
nicholas
of
pisa
and
other
early
sculptors
at
the
end
of
the
gothic
period
abandoned
the
meagre
bony
and
ugly
forms
of
hieratic
tradition
it
was
because
they
took
an
example
from
greek
preserved
or
exhumed
and
if
forgetting
our
distorted
and
defective
bodies
as
plebeians
or
thinkers
we
wish
to
find
again
some
type
of
the
perfect
form
it
is
in
these
statues
monuments
of
a
noble
unoccupied
gymnastic
life
that
we
must
seek
our
instruction
not
only
the
form
of
it
is
perfect
but
again
which
is
unique
it
suffices
for
the
thought
of
the
artist
the
greeks
having
assigned
to
the
body
a
dignity
of
its
own
were
not
tempted
like
the
moderns
to
subordinate
it
to
the
head
a
chest
breathing
healthily
a
trunk
solidly
resting
on
the
thighs
a
nervous
supple
leg
impelling
the
body
forward
with
ease
they
did
not
occupy
themselves
solely
with
the
breadth
of
a
thoughtful
forehead
with
the
frown
of
an
irritated
brow
or
the
turn
of
a
sarcastic
lip
they
could
limit
themselves
to
the
conditions
of
perfect
statuary
which
leaves
the
eye
without
an
iris
and
the
head
without
expression
which
prefers
quiet
personages
or
those
occupied
by
insignificant
action
which
commonly
employs
only
a
uniform
tint
either
of
marble
or
cf
bronze
which
leaves
the
picturesque
to
painting
and
abandons
dramatic
interest
to
literature
which
confined
to
but
ennobled
by
the
nature
of
its
materials
and
its
limited
domain
avoids
the
representation
of
details
of
physiognomy
of
the
casualties
of
human
agitation
in
order
to
detach
the
pure
and
abstract
form
and
thus
illuminate
the
sanctuaries
with
motionless
peaceful
august
effigies
in
which
human
nature
recognized
its
heroes
and
its
gods
statuary
accordingly
is
the
central
art
of
greece
other
arts
are
related
to
it
accompany
it
or
imitate
it
no
other
art
has
so
well
expressed
the
national

other

cultivated
or
so
popular

add
to

you
can
well
understand

that
reminiscences
of

past
trenched
on
the
misery
of

since

thinking
heads
still
reading
the
ancient
language
felt
in
a
confused
way
the
immensity
of
the
fall
the
whole
depth
of
the
abyss
into
which
the
human
species
had
been
engulphed
for
a
thousand
years
you
may
divine
the
sentiments
which
such
a
condition
of
things
so
extreme
and
so
lasting
implanted
in
people
breasts
at
first
there
was
weakness
disgust
of
life
and
the
deepest
melancholy
the
world
said
a
writer
of
that
day
is
nothing
but
an
abyss
of
vice
and
immodesty
life
seemed
a
foretaste
of
hell
many
withdrew
from
it
and
not
alone
the
poor
the
feeble
and
women
but
sovereign
lords
and
even
kings
such
as
possessed
delicate
and
noble
natures
preferred
the
tranquillity
and
monotony
of
the
cloister
on
the
approach
of
the
year
one
thousand
a
general
belief
in
the
extinction
of
the
world
prevailed
and
many
seized
with
fright
made
over
their
property
to
churches
and
convents
on
the
other
hand
and
coupled
with
this
terror
and
despondency
there
arose
an
extraordinary
degree
of
nervous
exaltation
when
men
are
very
miserable
they
become
excitable
like
invalids
and
prisoners
their
sensibility
increases
and
acquires
a
feminine
delicacy
their
heart
is
filled
with
caprices
agitations
and
despondency
excesses
and
effusions
from
which
they
are
free
in
a
healthy
state
they
depart
from
moderate
sentiments
which
alone
can
maintain
continuous
masculine
action
they
indulge
in
re
very
burst
into
tears
sink
down
on
their
knees
become
incapable
of
providing
for
themselves
imagine
infinite
sweet
and
tender
transports
yearning
to
diffuse
the
excessive
refinements
and
enthusiasm
of
their
intemperate
imaginations
in
short
they
are
prone
to
love
hence
we
see
them
developed
with
an
enormous
exaggeration
a
passion
unknown
to
the
stern
and
virile
souls
of
antiquity
namely
the
chivalric
mystic
love
of
the
middle
ages
the
calm
rational
love
of
wedlock
was
subordinated
to
the
ecstatic
and
unruly
love
encountered
outside
of
wedlock
its
subtleties
were
carefully
defined
and
embodied
in
the
maxims
of
tribunals
presided
over
by
ladies
it
was
decreed
there
that
love
could
not
exist
between
spouses
and
that
love
could
refuse
nothing
to
love
woman
was
no
longer
considered
as
flesh
and
blood
like
man
but
was
converted
into
a
divinity
man
was
only
too
well
compensated
in
the
privilege
of
adoring
and
serving
her
human
love
was
regarded
as
a
celestial
sentiment
leading
to
divine
love
and
confounded
with
it
poets
transformed
their
mistresses
into
supernatural
virtue
and
implored
them
to
guide
them
through
the
empyrean
to
the
tabernacle
of
god
you
can
easily
appreciate
the
hold
the
christian
faith
derived
from
such
sentiments
disgust
for
the
world
a
tendency
to
ecstacy
habitual
despair
and
infinite
craving
for
tender
sympathy
naturally
impelled
men
to
a
doctrine
representing
the
earth
as
a
vale
of
tears
the
present
life
a
period
of
trial
rapturous
union
with
the
divinity
as
supreme
happiness
and
the
love
of
god
as
the
first
of
duties

its

in

of

and

and

and
in
conceptions
of

a

itself
of
its
old

in
order
to

its

in
robes
of
whiteness
gothic
architecture
accordingly
made
its
appearance
let
us
observe
the
growth
of
the
new
gothic
edifice
in
opposition
to
the
religions
of
antiquity
which
were
all
local
belonging
to
castes
or
to
families
christianity
is
a
universal
religion
which
appeals
to
the
multitude
and
summons
all
men
to
salvation
it
was
necessary
accordingly
for
this
new
edifice
to
be
very
large
and
capable
of
containing
the
entire
population
of
any
one
city
or
district
the
women
the
children
the
serfs
the
artisans
and
the
poor
as
well
as
the
nobles
and
sovereigns
the
small
which
contains
the
statue
of
the
greek
god
and
the
portico
where
the
procession
of
free
citizens
was
displayed
were
not
sufficient
for
this
immense
crowd
an
enormous
vault
was
required
lofty
naves
multiplied
and
crossed
by
others
and
measureless
arches
and
colossal
columns
generations
of
workmen
flocked
in
crowds
for
centuries
to
labor
here
for
the
salvation
of
their
souls
displacing
mountains
before
the
monument
could
be
completed
the
men
who
enter
here
have
sorrowing
souls
and
the
ideas
they
come
in
quest
of
are
mournful
they
meditate
on
this
miserable
life
so
troubled
and
confined
by
such
an
abyss
on
hell
and
its
punishments
endless
measureless
and
unintermittent
on
the
sufferings
and
passion
of
christ
crucified
and
those
of
persecuted
and
tortured
saints
and
martyrs
listening
to
such
religious
teaching
and
under
the
burden
of
their
own
fears
they
could
ill
accommodate
themselves
to
the
simple
beauty
and
joyous
effect
of
pure
light
the
clear
and
healthy
light
of
day
is
accordingly
excluded
the
interior
of
the
edifice
remains
subject
to
cold
and
lugubrious
shadow
light
only
comes
in
transformed
by
stained
glass
into
purple
and
crimson
tints
into
the
splendors
of
topaz
and
amethyst
into
the
mystic
gleams
of
precious
stones
into
strange
illuminations
seeming
to
afford
glimpses
of
paradise
delicate
imaginations
like
these
are
not
content
with
simple
architectural
forms
and
first
form
in
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
interest
them
it
must
be
a
symbol
of
and
designate
some
august
mystery
the
edifice
with
its
transverse
naves
represents
the
cross
on
which
christ
died
its
circular
window
with
its
brilliant
petals
figures
the
rose
of
eternity
the
leaves
of
which
are
redeemed
souls
all
the
dimensions
of
its
parts
correspond
to
sacred
numbers
again
these
forms
in
their
richness
strangeness
boldness
delicacy
and
immensity
harmonize
with
the
intemperance
and
curiosity
of
a
morbid
fancy
vivid
sensations
manifold
changing
bizarre
and
extreme
are
necessary
to
such
souls
they
reject
the
column
the
horizontal
and
transverse
beams
the
round
arch
in
short
the
solid
construction
balanced
proportions
and
beautiful
simplicity
of
antique
architecture
they
do
not
sympathize
with
those
noble
creations
that
seem
to
have
been
born
without
pain
and
to
last
without
effort
which
attain
to
beauty
the
same
time
as
to
life
and
the
finished
excellence
of
which
needs
neither
addition
nor
ornament
they
adopt
for
type
not
the
plain
of
the
arcade
or
the
simple
angle
formed
by
the
column
and
the
architrave
but
the
complicated
union
of
two
curves
intersected
by
each
other
forming
the
ogive
they
aspire
to
the
gigantic
covering
square
acres
of
ground
with
piles
of
stone
binding
pillars
together
in
monstrous
columns
suspending
galleries
in
the
air
elevating
arches
to
the
skies
and
stage
upon
stage
of
belfry
until
their
spires
are
lost
in
the
clouds
they
exaggerate
the
delicacy
of
forms
they
surround
doors
with
series
of
statuettes
and
festoon
the
sides
with
trefoils
gables
and
gargoyles
they
interlace
the
tortuous
tracery
of
mullions
with
the
motley
hues
of
stained
glass
the
choir
seems
to
be
embroidered
with
lace
while
tombs
altars
stalls
and
towers
are
covered
with
mazes
of
slender
columns
and
fringes
of
leaves
and
statues
it
seems
as
if
they
wished
to
attain
at
once
infinite
grandeur
and
infinite
littleness
seeking
to
overwhelm
the
mind
on
either
side
on
the
one
hand
with
the
vastness
of
a
mass
and
on
the
other
with
a
prodigious
quantity
of
details
their
object
was
evidently
to
produce
an
extraordinary
sensation
they
aimed
to
dazzle
and
bewilder
proportionately
therefore
to
the
development
of
this
style
of
architecture
it
becomes
more
and
more
paradoxical
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
the
age
of
the
flamboyant
gothic
of
strasburg
milan
york
nuremburg
and
the
church
of
brou
solidity
seems
to
have
been
wholly
abandoned
for
ornament
at
one
time
it
bristles
with
a
profusion
of
multiplied
and
superposed
pinnacles
at
another
its
exterior
is
draped
with
a
lacework
of
mouldings
walls
are
hollowed
out
and
almost
wholly
absorbed
by
windows
they
lack
strength
and
without
the
buttresses
raised
against
them
the
structure
would
fall
ever
disintegrating
it
is
necessary
to
establish
colonies
of
masons
about
them
constantly
to
repair
their
constant
decay
this
embroidered
stonework
more
and
more
frail
as
it
ascends
the
spire
can
not
sustain
itself
it
has
to
be
fastened
to
a
skeleton
of
iron
and
as
iron
rusts
the
blacksmith
is
summoned
to
contribute
his
share
towards
propping
up
this
unstable
delusive
magnificence
in
the
interior
the
decoration
is
so
exuberant
and
complex
the
groinings
so
richly
display
their
thorny
and
tangled
vegetation
and
the
stalls
pulpit
and
railings
swarm
with
such
intricate
tortuous
fantastic
arabesques
that
the
church
no
longer
seems
to
be
a
sacred
monument
but
a
rare
example
of
the
jewellers
art
it
is
a
vast
structure
of
variegated
glass
a
gigantic
piece
of
filigree
work
a
festive
decoration
as
elaborated
as
that
of
a
queen
or
a
bride
it
is
the
adornment
of
a
nervous
woman
similar
to
the
extravagant
costumes
of
the
day
whose
delicate
and
morbid
poesy
denotes
by
its
excess
the
singular
sentiments
the
feverish
violent
and
impotent
aspiration
peculiar
to
an
age
of
knights
and
monks
for
this
architecture
which
has
lasted
four
centuries
is
not
confined
to
one
country
or
to
one
description
of
edifice
it
is
spread
over
all
europe
from
scotland
to
sicily
and
is
employed
in
all
civil
and
religious
and
public
and
private
monuments
not
only
do
cathedrals
and
chapels
bear
its
imprint
but
fortresses
palaces
costumes
dwellings
furniture
and
equipments
its
universality
accordingly
expresses
and
attests
the
great
moral
crisis
at
once
morbid
and
sublime
which
during
the
whole
of
the
middle
ages
exalted
and
at
the
same
time
disordered
the

by

forces
and
their

passes
away
or
their

century
the

formerly
his

and
towards
the

they
were

note
the
significance
of
this
term
a
courtier
is
a
member
of
the
king
court
that
is
to
say
a
person
charged
with
some
function
or
domestic
duty
in
the
palace
either
chamberlain
equerry
or
gentleman
of
the
antechamber
receiving
a
salary
and
addressing
his
master
with
all
the
deference
and
ceremonial
obsequiousness
proper
to
such
an
employment
but
this
person
is
not
a
valet
as
in
oriental
monarchies
for
his
ancestor
the
grandfather
of
his
grandfather
was
the
equal
the
companion
the
peer
of
the
king
and
on
this
account
he
himself
belongs
to
a
privileged
class
that
of
noblemen
he
does
not
serve
his
prince
solely
through
personal
interest
his
devotion
to
him
is
a
point
of
honor
the
prince
in
his
turn
never
neglects
to
treat
him
with
consideration

subsequently

france

gave
to
it

us
study
the

of

characters
the

the
first
in

is
frequented
by
the
most
select
society
the
most
admired
personage
therefore
the
accomplished
man
whom
everybody
accepts
for
a
model
is
the
nobleman
enjoying
familiarity
with
his
sovereign
this
nobleman
entertains
generous
sentiments
he
believes
himself
of
a
superior
race
and
he
says
to
himself
he
is
more
sensitive
than
other
men
on
the
point
of
honor
and
freely
risks
his
life
at
the
slightest
insult
under
louis
xiii
four
thousand
noblemen
were
killed
in
duels
contempt
of
danger
in
the
eyes
of
this
nobleman
is
the
first
obligation
of
a
soul
nobly
born
the
dandy
the
worldling
so
choice
of
his
ribbons
so
careful
of
his
perruque
is
ready
to
encamp
in

expose
himself
to
bullets
for

together
at

when

announces
that

about

versailles
is
deserted
all
these
young
perfumed
gallants
hasten
off
to
the
army
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
ball
finally
and
through
a
remnant
of
the
spirit
of
ancient
feudalism
our
nobleman
regards
the
monarch
as
his
natural
legitimate
chief
he
knows
he
is
bound
to
him
as
the
vassal
formerly
was
to
his
suzerain
and
at
need
will
give
him
his
blood
his
property
and
his
life
under
louis
xyi
noblemen
voluntarily
placed
themselves
at
the
king
disposal
and
on
the
of
august
many
were
slain
in
his
behalf
but
they
are
nevertheless
courtiers
that
is
to
say
men
of
the
world
and
in
this
respect
perfectly
polite
the
king
himself
sets
them
an
example
louis
xiv
even
doffed
his
hat
to
a
chambermaid
and
the
memoirs
of
simon
mention
a

who
saluted
so
frequently
that
he
was

to
cross
the
courts
of
versailles
bareheaded
the
courtier
for
the

reason
is
accomplished
in
all
that
appertains
to
good
language
never
fails
him
in
difficult
circumstances
he
is
a
diplomat
master

an
adept
in
the
art
of
disguising
concealing
flattering
and
managing
others
never
giving
offence
and
often
pleasing
all
these
qualifications
and
these
sentiments
proceed
from
an
aristocratic
spirit
refined
by
the
usages
of

they
attain
to

in
this

and
in
this
century
anybody
of
the
present
time
disposed
to
admire
the
choice
flowers
of
this
lost
and
delicate
species
need
not
look
for
them
in
our
equalized
rude
and
mixed
society
but
must
turn
to
the
elegant
formal
monumental
parterres
in
which
they
formerly
flourished
you
can
imagine
that
people
so
constituted
must
have
chosen
pleasures
appropriate
to
their
character
their
taste
indeed
like
their
persons
was
noble
for
they
were
not
only
noble
by
birth
but
also
through
their
sentiments
and
correct
because
they
were
educated
to
practise
and
respect
what
was
becoming
to
them
it
was
this
taste
which
in
the
seventeenth
century
fashioned
all
their
works
of
art
the
serious
elevated
severe
productions
of
poussin
and
lesueur
the
grave
pompous
elaborate
architecture
of
mansart
and
perrault
and
the
stately
symmetrical
gardens
of
lenotre
you
will
find
its
traces
in
the
furniture
costumes

and
carriages
of
the

and
paintings
of

its
symmetrical
alleys
its
my
theological
its
large
artificial
basins
its
trimmed
and
pruned
trees
modelled
into
architectural
designs
is
a
masterpiece
in
this
direction
all
its
edifices
and
parterres
everything
belonging
to
it
was
constructed
for
men
solicitous
about
their
dignity
and
strict
observers
of
the
recognized
standard
of
social
propriety
but
the
imprint
is
still
more
visible
in
the
literature
of
the
epoch
never
in
france
or
in

has
the
art
of

it

got
to

so
likewise
in
the
attributes

there

the
general
features
of
this
tragedy
first
claim
attention
they
are
all
calculated
to
please
noblemen
and
members
of
the
court
the
poet
does
not
fail
in
the
blandishment
of
truth
which
by
its
nature
is
often
crude
he
allows
no
murders
on
the
stage
he
disguises
brutality
and
repudiates

as

and
groans

senses
of
a

moderation

for
the

reason
he
excludes
disorder
never
abandoning
himself
to
the
caprices
of
fancy
and
imagination
like
shakespeare
his
plan
is
regular
he
admits
no
unforeseen
incidents
no
romantic
poesy
he
elaborates
his
scenes
explains
entrances
graduates
the
interest
of
his
piece
prepares
the
way
for
sudden
turns
of
fortune
and
skilfully
anticipates
and
directs
dénouements
finally
he
diffuses
throughout
the
dialogue
like
a
uniform
brilliant
varnish
a
studied
versification
composed
of
the
choicest
terms
and
the
most
harmonious
rhymes
if
we
seek
the
costume
of
this
drama
in
the
engravings
of
the
time
we
find
heroes
and
princesses
appearing
in
furbelows
embroideries
bootees
swords
and
plumes
a
dress
in
short
greek
in
name
but
french
in
taste
and

such
as
the
king
the
dauphin
and
the
princesses
paraded
in
to
the
music
of
violins
at
the
court
performances
of
ballets
note
moreover
that
all
his
personages
are
courtiers
kings
and
queens
princes
and
princesses
of
royal
blood
ambassadors
ministers
officers
of
the
guard
dependants
and
confidants
the
associates
of
princes
are
not
here
as
in

greek
tragedy
slaves
of
the
palace
and
nurses
born
under
their
master
roof
but
equerries
and
gentlemen
of
the
antechamber
charged
with
certain
duties
in
the
royal
household
we
readily
detect
this
in
their
conversational
ability
in
their
skill
in
flattery
in
their
perfect
education
in
their
exquisite
deportment
and
in
their
monarchical
sentiments
as
subjects
and
vassals
their
masters
like
themselves
are
french
noblemen
of
the
seventeenth
century
proud
and
courteous
heroic
in
corneille
and
noble
in

they
are
gallants
with
the
ladies
faithful
to
their
name
and
race
capable
of
sacrificing
their
dearest
interests
and
strongest
affections
to
their
honor
and
incapable
of
uttering
a

or
an
act
which
the
most
rigid
courtesy
would
not
authorize

this

might
be
called
a
perfect
picture
of
the
fashionable
world
like
gothic
architecture
it
represents
a
positive
complete
side
of
the
human
mind
and
this
is
why
like
that
it
has
become
so
universal
it
has
been
imported
into
or
imitated
by
along
with
its
accompanying
taste
literature
and
manners
every
court
of
europe
in
england
after
the
restoration
of
the
stuarts
in
spain
on
the
advent
of
the
bourbons
and
in
italy
germany
and
russia
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
are
warranted
in
saying
that
at
this
epoch
france
was
the
educator
of
europe
she
was
the
source
from
which
was
derived
all
that
was
elegant
and
agreeable
whatever
was
proper
in
style
delicate
in
ideas
and
perfect
in
the
art
of
social
intercourse
if
a
savage
muscovite
a
dull
german
a
stolid
englishman
or
any
other
uncivilized
or
man
of
the
north
quit
his
brandy
pipe
and
furs
his
feudal
or
hunting
or
rural
life
it
was
to
french
and
to
french
books
he
betook
himself
in
order
to
acquire
the
arts
of
politeness
urbanity
and
conversation
footnote
or
other
intimate
of
this
class
viii
this
brilliant
society
did
not
last
it
was
its
own
development
which
caused
its
dissolution
the
government
being
absolute
ended
in
becoming
negligent
and
tyrannical
and
besides
this
the
king
bestowed
the
best
offices
and
the
greatest
favor
only
on
such
of
the
nobles
of
his
court
as
enjoyed
his
intimacy
this
appeared
unjust
to
the
and
to
the
people
who
having
greatly
increased
in
numbers
wealth
and
intelligence
felt
their
power
augment
in
proportion
to
the
growth
of
their
discontent
the
french
revolution
was
accordingly
their
work
and
after
ten
years
of
trial
they
established
a
system
of
democracy
and
equality
in
which
according
to
a
fixed
order
of
promotion
all
civil
employments
were
ordinarily
accessible
to
everybody
the
wars
of
the
empire
and
the
contagion
of
example
gradually
spread
this
system
beyond
the
frontiers
of
france
and
whatever
may
be
local
differences
and
temporary
delays
it
is
now
evident
that
the
tendency
of
the
whole
of
europe
is
to
imitate
it
the
new
construction
of
society
coupled
with
the
invention
of
industrial
machinery
and
the
great
abatement
of
rudeness
in
manners
and
customs
has
changed
the
condition
as
well
as
the
character
of
man
henceforth
man
is
exempt
from
arbitrary
measures
and
is
protected
by
a
good
police
however
lowly
born
all
careers
are
open
to
him
an
enormous
increase
of
useful
articles
places
within
reach
of
the
poorest
conveniences
and
pleasures
of
which
two
centuries
ago
the
rich
were
entirely
ignorant
again
the
rigor
of
authority
is
mitigated
both
in
society
and
in
the
family
a
father
is
now
the
companion
of
his
children
and
the
citizen
has
become
the
equal
of
the
noble
human
life
in
short
displays
a
lesser
degree
of
misery
and
a
lighter
degree
of
oppression
but
as
a
counterpart
of
this
ave
see
ambition
and
cupidity
spreading
their
wings
accustomed
to
comfort
and
luxuries
and
obtaining
here
and
there
glimpses
of
happiness
man
begins
to
regard
happiness
and
comfort
as
his
due
the
more
he
obtains
the
more
exacting
he
becomes
and
the
more
his
pretensions
exceed
his
acquisitions
the
practical
sciences
also
having
made
great
progress
and
instruction
being
diffused
liberated
thought
abandons
itself
to
all
daring
enterprises
hence
it
happens
that
men
relinquishing
the
traditions
which
formerly
regulated
their
beliefs
deem
themselves
capable
through
intellect
alone
of
attaining
to
the
highest
truths
questions
of
every
kind
are
mooted
moral
political
and
religious
men
seek
knowledge
by
groping
their
way
in
every
direction
for
fifty
years
past
we
behold
this
strange
conflict
of
systems
and
sects
each
tendering
us
new
creeds
and
perfect
theories
of
happiness
such
a
state
of
things
has
a
wonderful
effect
on
minds
and
ideas
the
representative
man
that
is
to
say
the
character
who
occupies
the
stage
and
to
whom
the
spectators
award
the
most
interest
and
sympathy
is
the
melancholy
ambitious
dreamer
rené
faust
werther
and
manfred
a
yearning
heart
restless
wandering
and
incurably
miserable
and
he
is
miserable
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
he
is
too
easily
affected
by
the
lesser
evils
of
life
he
has
too
great
a
craving
for
delicate
and
blissful
sensations
he
is
too
much
accustomed
to
comfort
he
has
not
had
the
and
education
of
our
ancestors
he
has
not
been
roughly
handled
by
his
father
whipped
at
college
obliged
to
maintain
respectful
silence
in
the
presence
of
great
personages
and
had
his
mental
growth
retarded
by
domestic
discipline
he
has
not
been
compelled
as
in
ancient
times
to
use
his
own
arm
and
sword
to
protect
himself
to
travel
on
horseback
and
to
sleep
in
disagreeable
lodgings
in
the
soft
atmosphere
of
modern
comfort
and
of
sedentary
habits
he
has
become
delicate
nervous
excitable
and
less
capable
of
accommodating
himself
to
the
course
of
life
which
always
exacts
effort
and
imposes
trouble
on
the
other
hand
he
is
skeptical
society
and
religion
both
being
disturbed
in
the
midst
of
a
of
doctrines
and
an
irruption
of
new
theories
his
precocious
judgment
too
rapidly
instructed
and
too
soon
unbridled
precipitates
him
early
and
blindly
off
the
beaten
track
made
smooth
for
his
fathers
by
habit
and
which
they
have
trodden
led
on
by
tradition
and
governed
by
authority
all
the
barriers
which
served
as
guides
to
minds
having
fallen
he
rushes
forward
into
the
vast
confusing
field
which
is
opened
out
before
his
eyes
impelled
by
almost
superhuman
ambition
and
curiosity
he
darts
off
in
the
pursuit
of
absolute
truth
and
infinite
happiness
neither
love
glory
knowledge
nor
power
as
we
find
these
in
this
world
can
satisfy
him
the
intemperance
of
his
desires
irritated
by
the
incompleteness
of
his
conquests
and
by
the
nothingness
of
his
enjoyments
leaves
him
prostrate
amid
the
ruins
of
his
own
nature
without
his
jaded
enfeebled
impotent
imagination
being
able
to
represent
to
him
the
which
he
covets
and
the
unknown
which
he
has
not
this
evil
has
been
styled
the
great
malady
of
the
age
forty
years
ago
it
was
in
full
force
and
under
the
apparent
frigidity
or
gloomy
impassibility
of
the
positive
mind
of
the
present
day
it
still
subsists
i
have
not
the
time
to
show
you
the
innumerable
effects
of
a
like
state
of
mind
on
works
of
art
you
may
trace
them
in
the
great
development
of
the
lyrical
sentimental
and
philosophical
poetry
of
france
germany
and
england
again
in
the
corruption
and
enrichment
of
language
and
in
the
invention
of
new
classes
and
of
new
characters
in
literature
in
the
style
and
sentiments
of
all
the
great
modern
writers
from
chateaubriand
to
balzac
from
goethe
to
heine
from
cowper
to
byron
and
from
alfieri
to
leopardi
you
will
find
analogous
symptoms
in
the
arts
of
design
if
you
observe
their
feverish
tortured
and
painfully
archeological
style
their
aim
at
dramatic
effect
psychological
expression
and
local
fidelity
if
you
observe
the
confusion
which
has
befogged
the
schools
and
injured
their
processes
if
you
pay
attention
to
the
countless
gifted
minds
who
shaken
by
new
emotions
have
opened
out
new
ways
if
you
analyze
the
profound
sympathy
for
scenery
which
has
given
birth
to
a
complete
and
original
landscape
art
but
there
is
another
art
music
which
has
suddenly
reached
an
extraordinary
development
this
development
is
one
of
the
salient
characteristics
of
our
epoch
and
the
dependence
of
this
on
the
modern
mind
the
ties
by
which
they
are
connected
i
shall
endeavor
to
point
out
to
you
this
art
was
born
and
necessarily
in
two
countries
where
people
sing
naturally
italy
and
germany
it
was
gestating
for
a
century
and
a
half
in
italy
from
palestrina
to
pergolese
as
formerly
painting
from
giotto
to
massaccio
discovering
processes
and
feeling
its
way
in
order
to
acquire
its
resources
at
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
suddenly
burst
forth
with
scarlatti
marcello
and
handel
this
is
a
most
remarkable
epoch
painting
at
this
time
ceased
to
nourish
in
italy
and
in
the
midst
of
political
stagnation
voluptuous
effeminate
customs
prevailed
furnishing
an
assembly
of
sigisbés
lindors
and
amorous
ladies
for
the
roulades
and
tender
sentimental
scenes
of
the
opera
grave
ponderous
germany
at
that
time
the
latest
in
acquiring
now
succeeds
in
displaying
the
severity
and
grandeur
of
its
religious
sentiment
its
profound
knowledge
and
its
vague
melancholy
instincts
in
the
sacred
music
of
sebastian
bach
anticipating
the
evangelical
epic
of
klopstock
tn
the
old
and
in
the
new
nation
the
reign
and
expression
of
is
beginning
between
the
two
and
is
austria
conciliating
the
two
spirits
producing
haydn
gluck
and
mozart
music
now
becomes
cosmopolite
and
universal
on
the
confines
of
that
great
mental
convulsion
of
souls
styled
the
french
revolution
as
formerly
painting
under
the
impulse
of
the
great
intellectual
revival
known
under
the
name
of
the
renaissance
we
need
not
be
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
this
new
art
for
it
corresponds
to
the
appearance
of
a
new
genius
that
of
the
ruling
morbid
restless
ardent
character
i
have
attempted
to
portray
for
you
it
is
to
this
spirit
that
beethoven
mendelssohn
and
weber
formerly
addressed
themselves
and
to
which
meyerbeer
berlioz
and
verdi
are
now
striving
to
accommodate
themselves
music
is
the
organ
of
this
excessive
sensibility
and
vague
boundless
aspiration
it
is
expressly
designed
for
this
service
and
no
art
so
well
performs
its
task
and
this
is
so
because
on
the
one
hand
music
is
founded
on
a
more
or
less
remote
imitation
of
a
cry
which
is
the
natural
spontaneous
complete
expression
of
passion
and
which
affecting
us
through
a
corporeal
stimulus
instantly
arouses
involuntary
sympathy
so
that
the
tremulous
delicacy
of
every
nervous
being
finds
in
it
its
impulse
its
echo
and
its
ministrant
on
the
other
hand
founded
on
relationships
of
sounds
which
represent
no
living
form
and
which
especially
in
instrumental
music
seem
to
be
the
reveries
of
an
incorporeal
soul
it
is
better
adapted
than
any
other
art
to
express
floating
thoughts
formless
dreams
objectless
limitless
desires
the
grandiose
and
dolorous
mazes
of
a
troubled
heart
which
aspires
to
all
and
is
attached
to
nothing
this
is
why
along
with
the
discontent
the
agitations
and
the
hopes
of
modern
democracy
music
has
left
its
natal
countries
and
diffused
itself
over
all
europe
and
why
you
see
at
the
present
time
the
most
complicated
symphonies
attracting
crowds
in
france
where
thus
far
the
national
music
has
been
reduced
to
the
song
and
the
melodies
of
the
vaudeville
ix
the
foregoing
illustrations
gentlemen
seem
to
me
sufficient
to
establish
the
law
governing
the
character
and
creation
of
works
of
art
and
not
only
do
they
establish
it
but
they
accurately
define
it
in
the
beginning
of
this
section
i
stated
that
work
of
art
is
determined
by
an
aggregate
which
is
the
general
state
of
the
mind
and
surrounding
we
may
now
advance
another
step
and
note
precisely
in
their
order
each
link
of
the
chain
connecting
together
cause
and
effect
in
the
various
illustrations
we
have
considered
you
have
remarked
first
a
situation
in
other
words
a
certain
universal
condition
of
good
or
evil
one
of
servitude
or
of
liberty
a
state
of
wealth
or
of
poverty
a
particular
form
of
society
a
certain
species
of
religious
faith
in
greece
the
free
martial
city
with
its
slaves
in
the
middle
ages
feudal
oppression
invasion
and
brigandage
and
an
exalted
phase
of
christianity
the
court
life
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
industrial
and
studied
democracy
of
the
nineteenth
guided
by
the
sciences
in
short
a
group
of
circumstances
controlling
man
and
to
which
he
is
compelled
to
resign
himself
this
situation
developes
in
man
corresponding
needs
distinct
and
physical
activity
a
tendency
to
revery
here
rudeness
and
there
refinement
at
one
time
a
martial
instinct
at
another
conversational
talent
at
another
a
love
of
pleasure
and
a
thousand
other
complex
and
varied
peculiarities
in
greece
we
see
physical
perfection
and
a
balance
of
faculties
which
no
manual
or
cerebral
excess
of
life
deranges
in
the
middle
ages
the
intemperance
of
imaginations
and
the
delicacy
of
feminine
sensibility
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
polish
and
of
society
and
the
dignity
of
aristocratic
and
in
modern
times
the
grandeur
of
unchained
ambitions
and
the
morbidity
of
unsatisfied
yearnings
now
this
group
of
sentiments
aptitudes
and
needs
constitutes
when
concentrated
in
one
person
and
powerfully
displayed
by
him
representative
man
that
is
to
say
a
model
character
to
whom
his
contemporaries
award
all
their
admiration
and
all
their
sympathy
there
is
for
instance
in
greece
the
naked
youth
of
a
fine
race
and
accomplished
in
all
bodily
exercise
in
the
middle
ages
the
ecstatic
monk
and
the
amorous
knight
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
perfect
courtier
and
in
our
days
the
melancholy
insatiable
faust
or
werther
moreover
as
this
personage
is
the
most
captivating
the
most
important
and
the
most
conspicuous
of
all
it
is
he
whom
artists
present
to
the
public
now
concentrated
in
an
ideal
personage
when
their
art
like
painting
sculpture
the
drama
the
romance
or
the
epic
is
imitative
now
dispersed
in
its
elements
as
in
architecture
and
in
music
where
art
excites
emotions
without
incarnating
them
all
their
labor
therefore
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
they
either
represent
this
character
or
address
themselves
to
it
the
symphonies
of
beethoven
and
the
storied
windows
of
cathedrals
are
addressed
to
it
and
it
is
represented
in
the
niobe
group
of
antiquity
and
in
the
agamemnon
and
achilles
of
racine
art
therefore
depends
on
it
since
the
whole
of
art
is
applied
only
to
conform
to
or
to
express
it
a
general
situation
provoking
tendencies
and
special
faculties
a
representative
man
embodying
these
predominant
tendencies
and
faculties
sounds
forms
colors
or
language
giving
this
character
sensuous
form
or
which
comport
with
the
tendencies
and
faculties
comprising
it
such
are
the
four
terms
of
the
series
the
first
carries
with
it
the
second
the
second
the
third
and
the
third
the
fourth
so
that
the
slightest
variation
of
either
involves
a
corresponding
variation
in
those
that
follow
and
reveals
a
corresponding
variation
in
those
that
precede
it
permitting
abstract
reasoning
in
either
direction
in
an
ascending
or
descending
scale
of
progression
as
far
as
i
am
capable
of
judging
this
formula
embraces
everything
if
now
we
insert
between
these
diverse
terms
the
accessory
causes
occurring
to
modify
their
effects
if
in
order
to
explain
the
sentiments
of
an
epoch
we
add
an
examination
of
race
to
that
of
the
social
medium
if
in
order
to
explain
the
works
of
art
of
any
age
we
consider
besides
the
prevailing
tendencies
of
that
age
the
particular
period
of
the
art
and
the
particular
sentiments
of
each
artist
we
shall
then
derive
from
the
law
not
only
the
great
revolutions
and
general
forms
of
man
imagination
but
again
the
differences
between
national
schools
the
incessant
variations
of
various
styles
and
the
original
characteristics
of
the
works
of
every
great
master
thus
followed
out
such
an
explanation
will
be
complete
since
it
furnishes
at
once
the
general
traits
of
each
school
and
the
distinctive
traits
which
in
this
school
characterize
individuals
we
are
about
to
enter
upon
this
study
in
relation
to
italian
art
it
is
a
long
and
difficult
task
and
i
have
need
of
your
attention
in
order
to
pursue
it
to
the
end
footnote
this
law
may
be
applied
to
the
study
of
all
literatures
and
to
every
art
the
student
may
begin
with
the
fourth
term
proceeding
from
this
to
the
first
strictly
adhering
to
the
order
of
the
series
x
before
proceeding
further
gentlemen
there
is
a
practical
and
personal
conclusion
due
to
our
researches
and
which
is
applicable
to
the
present
order
of
things
you
have
observed
that
each
situation
produces
a
certain
state
of
mind
followed
by
a
corresponding
class
of
works
of
art
this
is
why
every
new
situation
must
produce
a
new
state
of
mind
and
consequently
a
new
class
of
works
and
therefore
why
the
social
medium
of
the
present
day
now
in
the
course
of
formation
ought
to
produce
its
own
works
like
the
social
mediums
that
have
gone
before
it
this
is
not
a
simple
supposition
based
on
the
current
of
desire
and
of
hope
it
is
the
result
of
a
law
resting
on
the
authority
of
experience
and
on
the
testimony
of
history
from
the
moment
a
law
is
established
it
is
good
for
all
time
the
connections
of
things
in
the
present
accompany
connections
of
things
in
the
past
and
in
the
future
accordingly
it
need
not
be
said
in
these
days
that
art
is
exhausted
it
is
true
that
certain
schools
no
longer
exist
and
can
no
longer
be
revived
that
certain
arts
languish
and
that
the
future
upon
which
we
are
entering
does
not
promise
to
furnish
the
aliment
that
these
require
but
art
itself
which
is
the
faculty
of
perceiving
and
expressing
the
leading
character
of
objects
is
as
enduring
as
the
civilization
of
which
it
is
the
best
and
earliest
fruit
what
its
forms
will
be
and
which
of
the
five
great
arts
will
provide
the
of
expression
of
future
sentiment
we
are
not
called
upon
to
decide
we
have
the
right
to
affirm
that
new
forms
will
arise
and
an
appropriate
mould
be
found
in
which
to
cast
them
we
have
only
to
open
our
eyes
to
see
a
change
going
on
in
the
condition
of
men
and
consequently
in
their
minds
so
profound
so
universal
and
so
rapid
that
no
other
century
has
witnessed
the
like
of
it
the
three
causes
that
have
formed
the
modern
mind
continue
to
operate
with
increasing
efficacy
you
are
all
aware
that
discoveries
in
the
positive
sciences
are
multiplying
daily
that
geology
organic
chemistry
history
entire
branches
of
physics
and
zoology
are
contemporary
productions
that
the
growth
of
experience
is
infinite
and
the
applications
of
discovery
unlimited
that
means
of
communication
and
transport
cultivation
trade
mechanical
contrivances
all
the
elements
of
human
power
are
yearly
spreading
and
concentrating
beyond
all
expectation
none
of
you
are
ignorant
that
the
political
machine
works
smoother
in
the
same
sense
that
communities
becoming
more
rational
and
humane
are
watchful
of
internal
order
protecting
talent
aiding
the
feeble
and
the
poor
in
short
that
everywhere
and
in
every
way
man
is
cultivating
his
intellectual
faculties
and
ameliorating
his
social
condition
we
can
not
accordingly
deny
that
men
habits
ideas
and
condition
transform
themselves
nor
reject
this
consequence
that
such
renewal
of
minds
and
things
brings
along
with
it
a
renewal
of
art
the
first
period
of
this
evolution
gave
rise
to
the
glorious
french
school
of
it
remains
for
us
to
witness
the
second
the
field
which
is
open
to
your
ambition
and
your
labor
on
its
very
threshold
you
have
a
right
to
augur
well
of
your
century
and
of
yourselves
for
the
patient
study
we
have
just
terminated
shows
you
that
to
produce
beautiful
works
the
sole
condition
necessary
is
that
which
the
great
goethe
indicated
fill
your
mind
and
heart
however
large
with
ideas
and
sentiments
of
your
age
and
work
will
follow
the
