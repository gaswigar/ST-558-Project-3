notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors

notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

my

with

take
vp

some
grauer
eye
pierce

see
his

ha
he
that
if
not
from

the

our
has
done
this
and
tis
well
for

who
can
not

he
did
it
now
this
followes
which
as
i
take
it
is
a
kinde
of
puppie
to
th
old
dam
treason
charles
the
emperour
vnder
pretence
to
see
the
queene
his
aunt
for
twas
indeed
his
colour
but
he
came
to
whisper
wolsey
here
makes
visitation
his
feares
were
that
the
interview
betwixt
england
and
france
might
through
their
amity
breed
him
some
preiudice
for
from
this
league
peep
harmes
that
menac
him
priuily
deales
with
our
cardinal
and
as
i
troa
which
i
doe
well
for
i
am
sure
the
emperour
paid
ere
he
promis
whereby
his
suit
was
granted
ere
it
was
ask
but
when
the
way
was
made
and
pau
with
gold
the
emperor
thus
desir
that
he
would
please
to
alter
the
kings
course
and
breake
the
foresaid
peace
let
the
king
know
as
soone
he
shall
by
me
that
thus
the
cardinall
does
buy
and
sell
his
honour
as
he
pleases
and
for
his
owne
aduantage
norf
i
am
sorry
to
heare
this
of
him
and
could
wish

iourney
i
replide
men
feare
the
french
would
proue
perfidious
to
the
kings
danger
presently
the
duke
said
was
the
feare
indeed
and
that
he
doubted
proue
the
verity
of
certaine
words
spoke
by
a
holy
monke
that
oft
sayes
he
hath
sent
to

accus
him
strongly
which
he
faine
would
haue
flung
from

not

so
his
peeres
vpon
this
euidence
haue
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
much
he
spoke
and
learnedly
for
life
but
all
was
either
pittied
in
him
or
forgotten
after
all
this
how
did
he
beare
himselfe
when
he
was
brought
agen

sir
did
you
not
of

heare
a
buzzing
of
a
separation
betweene
the
king
and
katherine
yes
but
it
held
not
for
when
the
king
once
heard
it
out
of
anger
he
sent
command
to
the
lord
mayor
straight
to
stop
the
rumor
and
allay
those
tongues
that
durst
disperse
it
but
that
slander
sir
is
found
a
truth
now
for
it
growes
agen
fresher
then
e
it
was
and
held
for
certaine
the
king
will
venture
at
it
either
the
cardinall
or
some
about

neere
haue
out
of

tis
the

him
on
the
emperour
for

of
toledo
this
is
i
thinke
you
haue
hit
the
marke
but
not
cruell
that
she
should
feele
the
smart
of
this
the
cardinall
will
haue
his

must
fall

do
beleeue
induc
by
potent
circumstances
that
you
are
mine
enemy
and
make
my
challenge
you
shall
not
be
my
iudge
for
it
is
you
haue
blowne
this
coale
betwixt
my
lord

me
which
gods
dew
quench
therefore
i
say
againe
i
vtterly
abhorre

from

refuse
you
for
my

whom
yet
once
more
i

professe
you
speake
not
like
your

further
shall

from

whole
consistorie
of

know
that

free
of
your

he
knowes
i
am
not
of

therefore
in
him
it
lies
to

with
thankes
to

for
such
a
royall

spake

the

word
that

my

i
doe

vpon

i
free
you

so
but
like
to
village
curres

when
their

by
some
of
these
the
queene
is
put
in
anger
excus
but
will
you
be
more
you
euer
haue
wish
the
sleeping
of
this
busines
neuer
it
to
be
stir
but
oft
haue
hindred
oft
the
passages
made
toward
it
on
my
honour
i
speake
my
good
lord
cardnall
to
this
point
and
thus
farre
cleare
him
now
what
mou
me
i
will
be
bold
with
time
and
your
attention
then
marke
th
inducement
thus
it
came
giue
heede
my
conscience
first
receiu
a
tendernes
scruple
and
pricke
on
certaine
speeches
by
th
bishop
of
bayon
then
french
embassador
who
had
beene
hither
sent
on
the
debating
and
marriage
the
duke
of
orleance
and
our
daughter
mary
progresse
of
this
busines
ere
a
determinate
resolution
hee
i
meane
the
bishop
did
require
a
respite
wherein
he
might
the
king
his
lord
aduertise
whether
our
daughter
were
legitimate
respecting
this
our
marriage
with
the
dowager
sometimes
our
brothers
wife
this
respite
shooke
the
bosome
of
my
conscience
enter
me
yea
with
a
spitting
power
and
made
to
tremble
the
region
of
my
breast
which
forc
such
way
that
many
maz
considerings
did
throng
and
prest
in
with
this
caution
first
me
thought
i
stood
not
in
the
smile
of
heauen
who
had
commanded
nature
that
my
ladies
wombe
if
it
conceiu
a
by
me
should
doe
no
more
offices
of
life
then
the
graue
does
to
th
dead
for
her
male
issue
or
where
they
were
made
or
shortly
after
this
world
had
ayr
them
hence
i
tooke
a
thought
this
was
a
iudgement
on
me
that
my
kingdome
well
worthy
the
best
heyre
world
should
not
be
gladded
i
by
me
then
followes
that
i
weigh
the
danger
which
my
realmes
stood
in
by
this
my
issues
faile
and
that
gaue
to
me
many
a
groaning
throw
thus
hulling
in
the
wild
sea
of
my
conscience
i
did
steere
toward
this
remedy
whereupon
we
are
now
present
heere
together
that
to
say
i
meant
to
rectifie
my
conscience
which
i
then
did
feele
full
sicke
and
yet
not
well
by
all
the
reuerend
fathers
of
the
land
and
doctors
learn
first
i
began
in
priuate
with
you
my
lord

vnder
my

spoke
long
be
pleas
your
selfe
to
say
how
farre
you
satisfide
me
lin
so
please
your
highnes
the
question
did
at
first
so
stagger
me
bearing
a
state
of
mighty
moment
i
and
consequence
of
dread
that
i
committed
the
daringst
counsaile
which
i
had
to
doubt
and
did
entreate
your
highnes
to
this
course
which
you
are
running

then
