chapter
i
the
finding
of
the
copper
cylinder
it
occurred
as
far
back
as
february
it
happened
on
that
day
that
the
yacht
falcon
lay
becalmed
upon
the
ocean
between
the
canaries
and
the
madeira
islands
this
yacht
falcon
was
the
property
of
lord
featherstone
who
being
weary
of
life
in
england
had
taken
a
few
congenial
friends
for
a
winter
cruise
in
these
southern
latitudes
they
had
visited
the
azores
the
canaries
and
the
madeira
islands
and
were
now
on
their
way
to
the
mediterranean
the
wind
had
failed
a
deep
calm
had
succeeded
and
everywhere
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
water
was
smooth
and
glassy
the
yacht
rose
and
fell
at
the
impulse
of
the
long
ocean
undulations
and
the
creaking
of
the
spars
sounded
out
a
lazy
accompaniment
to
the
motion
of
the
vessel
all
around
was
a
watery
horizon
except
in
the
one
place
only
toward
the
south
where
far
in
the
distance
the
peak
of
teneriffe
rose
into
the
air
the
profound
calm
the
warm
atmosphere
the
slow
pitching
of
the
yacht
and
the
dull
creaking
of
the
spars
all
combined
to
lull
into
a
state
of
indolent
repose
the
people
on
board
forward
were
the
crew
some
asleep
others
smoking
others
playing
cards
at
the
stern
were
oxenden
the
intimate
friend
of
featherstone
and
congreve
who
had
come
in
the
double
capacity
of
friend
and
medical
attendant
these
two
like
the
crew
were
in
a
state
of
dull
and
languid
repose
suspended
between
the
two
masts
in
an
indian
hammock
lay
featherstone
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
novel
in
his
hand
which
he
was
pretending
to
read
the
fourth
member
of
the
party
melick
was
seated
near
the
mainmast
folding
some
papers
in
a
peculiar
way
his
occupation
at
length
attracted
the
roving
eyes
of
featherstone
who
poked
forth
his
head
from
his
hammock
and
said
in
a
sleepy
voice
i
say
melick
you
the
most
energetic
fellah
i
ever
saw
by
jove
you
the
only
one
aboard
that
busy
what
are
you
doing
paper
boats
said
melick
in
a
tone
paper
boats
by
jove
said
featherstone
what
for
i
going
to
have
a
regatta
said
melick
anything
to
kill
time
you
know
by
jove
exclaimed
featherstone
again
raising
himself
higher
in
his
hammock
that
not
a
bad
idea
a
wegatta
by
jove
glowious
glowious
i
say
oxenden
did
you
hear
that
what
do
you
mean
by
a
regatta
asked
oxenden
lazily
oh
i
mean
a
race
with
these
paper
boats
we
can
bet
on
them
you
know
at
this
featherstone
sat
upright
with
his
legs
dangling
out
of
the
hammock
by
jove
he
exclaimed
again
betting
so
we
can
do
you
know
melick
old
chap
i
think
that
a
wegular
piece
of
inspiration
a
wegatta
and
we
can
bet
on
the
best
boat
but
there
is
any
wind
said
oxenden
well
you
know
that
the
fun
of
it
said
melick
who
went
solemnly
on
as
he
spoke
folding
his
paper
boats
that
the
fun
of
it
for
you
see
if
there
was
a
wind
we
should
be
going
on
ourselves
and
the
regatta
could
come
off
but
as
it
is
the
water
is
just
right
you
pick
out
your
boat
and
lay
your
bet
on
her
to
race
to
some
given
point
a
given
point
but
how
can
we
find
any
oh
easily
enough
something
or
anything
a
bubble
do
or
we
can
pitch
out
a
bit
of
wood
upon
this
featherstone
descended
from
his
perch
and
came
near
to
examine
the
proceedings
while
the
other
two
eager
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
excitement
soon
joined
him
by
this
time
melick
had
finished
his
paper
boats
there
were
four
of
them
and
they
were
made
of
different
colors
namely
red
green
yellow
and
white
i
put
these
in
the
water
said
melick
and
then
we
can
lay
our
bets
on
them
as
we
choose
but
first
let
us
see
if
there
is
anything
that
can
be
taken
as
a
point
of
arrival
if
there
is
anything
i
can
pitch
out
a
bit
of
wood
in
any
direction
which
may
seem
best
saying
this
he
went
to
the
side
followed
by
the
others
and
all
looked
out
carefully
over
the
water
there
a
black
speck
out
there
said
oxenden
so
there
is
said
featherstone
that
do
i
wonder
what
it
is
oh
a
bit
of
timber
said
melick
probably
the
spar
of
some
ship
it
do
look
like
a
spar
said
the
doctor
it
only
a
round
spot
like
the
float
of
some
net
oh
it
a
spar
said
melick
it
one
end
of
it
the
rest
is
under
water
the
spot
thus
chosen
was
a
dark
circular
object
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
certainly
did
look
very
much
like
the
extremity
of
some
spar
the
rest
of
which
was
under
water
whatever
it
was
however
it
served
well
enough
for
their
present
purpose
and
no
one
took
any
further
interest
in
it
except
as
the
point
toward
which
the
paper
boats
should
run
in
their
eventful
race
melick
now
let
himself
down
over
the
side
and
placed
the
paper
boats
on
the
water
as
carefully
as
possible
after
this
the
four
stood
watching
the
little
fleet
in
silence
the
water
was
perfectly
still
and
there
was
no
perceptible
wind
but
there
were
draughts
of
air
caused
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
yacht
and
these
affected
the
tiny
boats
gradually
they
drew
apart
the
green
one
drifting
astern
the
yellow
one
remaining
under
the
vessel
while
the
red
and
the
white
were
carried
out
in
the
direction
where
they
were
expected
to
go
with
about
a
foot
of
space
between
them
two
to
one
on
the
red
cried
featherstone
betting
on
the
one
which
had
gained
the
lead
done
said
melick
promptly
taking
his
offer
oxenden
made
the
same
bet
which
was
taken
by
melick
and
the
doctor
other
bets
were
now
made
as
to
the
direction
which
they
would
take
as
to
the
distance
by
which
the
red
would
beat
the
white
as
to
the
time
which
would
be
occupied
by
the
race
and
as
to
fifty
other
things
which
need
not
be
mentioned
all
took
part
in
this
the
excitement
rose
high
and
the
betting
went
on
merrily
at
length
it
was
noticed
that
the
white
was
overhauling
the
red
the
excitement
grew
intense
the
betting
changed
its
form
but
was
still
kept
up
until
at
last
the
two
paper
boats
seemed
blended
together
in
one
dim
spot
which
gradually
faded
out
of
sight
it
was
now
necessary
to
determine
the
state
of
the
race
so
featherstone
ordered
out
the
boat
the
four
were
soon
embarked
and
the
men
rowed
out
toward
the
point
which
had
been
chosen
as
the
end
of
the
race
on
coming
near
they
found
the
paper
boats
stuck
together
saturated
with
water
and
floating
limp
on
the
surface
an
animated
discussion
arose
about
this
some
of
the
bets
were
off
but
others
remained
an
open
question
and
each
side
insisted
upon
a
different
view
of
the
case
in
the
midst
of
this
featherstone
attention
was
drawn
to
the
dark
spot
already
mentioned
as
the
goal
of
the
race
that
a
thing
said
he
suddenly
pull
up
lads
a
little
let
see
what
it
is
it
does
look
to
me
like
a
spar
the
others
always
on
the
lookout
for
some
new
object
of
interest
were
attracted
by
these
words
and
looked
closely
at
the
thing
in
question
the
men
pulled
the
boat
drew
nearer
it
some
sort
of
floating
vessel
said
oxenden
it
not
a
spar
said
melick
who
was
at
the
bow
and
as
he
said
this
he
reached
out
and
grasped
at
it
he
failed
to
get
it
and
did
no
more
than
touch
it
it
moved
easily
and
sank
but
soon
came
up
again
a
second
time
he
grasped
at
it
and
with
both
hands
this
time
he
caught
it
and
then
lifted
it
out
of
the
water
into
the
boat
these
proceedings
had
been
watched
with
the
deepest
interest
and
now
as
this
curious
floating
thing
made
its
appearance
among
them
they
all
crowded
around
it
in
eager
excitement
it
looks
like
a
can
of
preserved
meat
said
the
doctor
it
certainly
is
a
can
said
melick
for
it
made
of
metal
but
as
to
preserved
meat
i
have
my
doubts
the
article
in
question
was
made
of
metal
and
was
cylindrical
in
shape
it
was
soldered
tight
and
evidently
contained
something
it
was
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
eight
wide
the
nature
of
the
metal
was
not
easily
perceptible
for
it
was
coated
with
slime
and
covered
over
about
half
its
surface
with
barnacles
and
it
was
not
heavy
and
would
have
floated
higher
out
of
the
water
had
it
not
been
for
these
encumbrances
it
some
kind
of
preserved
meat
said
the
doctor
perhaps
something
good
game
i
dare
say
yes
yorkshire
they
pot
all
sorts
of
things
now
if
it
game
said
oxenden
it
be
rather
high
by
this
time
man
alive
look
at
those
weeds
and
shells
it
must
have
been
floating
for
ages
it
my
belief
said
featherstone
that
it
part
of
the
provisions
laid
in
by
noah
for
his
long
voyage
in
the
ark
so
come
let
open
it
and
see
what
sort
of
diet
the
antediluvians
had
it
may
be
liquor
said
oxenden
melick
shook
his
head
no
said
he
there
something
inside
but
whatever
it
is
it
liquor
it
odd
too
the
thing
is
of
foreign
make
evidently
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
before
it
may
be
chinese
by
jove
cried
featherstone
this
is
getting
exciting
let
go
back
to
the
yacht
and
open
it
the
men
rowed
back
to
the
yacht
it
meat
of
some
sort
continued
the
doctor
i
certain
of
that
it
has
come
in
good
time
we
can
have
it
for
dinner
you
may
have
my
share
then
said
oxenden
i
hereby
give
and
bequeath
to
you
all
my
right
title
and
interest
in
and
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
meat
that
may
be
inside
meat
cans
said
melick
are
never
so
large
as
that
oh
i
do
know
about
that
said
the
doctor
they
make
up
pretty
large
packages
of
pemmican
for
the
arctic
expeditions
but
they
never
pack
up
pemmican
in
copper
cylinders
said
melick
who
had
been
using
his
knife
to
scrape
off
the
crust
from
the
vessel
copper
exclaimed
oxenden
is
it
copper
look
for
yourselves
said
melick
quietly
they
all
looked
and
could
see
where
the
knife
had
cut
into
the
vessel
that
it
was
as
he
said
it
was
copper
it
foreign
work
said
melick
in
england
we
make
tin
cans
for
everything
it
may
be
something
that
drifted
out
from
mogadore
or
some
port
in
morocco
in
that
case
said
oxenden
it
may
contain
the
mangled
remains
of
one
of
the
wives
of
some
moorish
pasha
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
yacht
and
hurried
aboard
all
were
eager
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
search
was
made
for
a
but
to
no
purpose
then
featherstone
produced
a
knife
which
was
used
to
open
sardine
boxes
but
after
a
faithful
trial
this
proved
useless
at
length
melick
who
had
gone
off
in
search
of
something
more
effective
made
his
appearance
armed
with
an
axe
with
this
he
attacked
the
copper
cylinder
and
by
means
of
a
few
dexterous
blows
succeeded
in
cutting
it
open
then
he
looked
in
what
do
you
see
asked
featherstone
something
said
melick
but
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
if
you
ca
make
it
out
then
shake
it
out
said
oxenden
upon
this
melick
took
the
cylinder
turned
it
upside
down
shook
it
smartly
and
then
lifted
it
and
pounded
it
against
the
deck
this
served
to
loosen
the
contents
which
seemed
tightly
packed
but
came
gradually
down
until
at
length
they
could
be
seen
and
drawn
forth
melick
drew
them
forth
and
the
contents
of
the
mysterious
copper
cylinder
resolved
themselves
into
two
packages
the
sight
of
these
packages
only
served
to
intensify
their
curiosity
if
it
had
been
some
species
of
food
it
would
at
once
have
revealed
itself
but
these
packages
suggested
something
more
important
what
could
they
be
were
there
treasures
inside
jewels
or
golden
ornaments
from
some
moorish
seraglio
or
strange
coin
from
far
cathay
one
of
the
packages
was
very
much
larger
than
the
other
it
was
enclosed
in
wrappers
made
of
some
coarse
kind
of
felt
bound
tight
with
strong
cords
the
other
was
much
smaller
and
was
folded
in
the
same
material
without
being
bound
this
melick
seized
and
began
to
open
wait
a
minute
said
featherstone
let
make
a
bet
on
it
five
guineas
that
it
some
sort
of
jewels
done
said
oxenden
melick
opened
the
package
and
it
was
seen
that
featherstone
had
lost
there
were
no
jewels
but
one
or
two
sheets
of
something
that
looked
like
paper
it
was
not
paper
however
but
some
vegetable
product
which
was
used
for
the
same
purpose
the
surface
was
smooth
but
the
color
was
dingy
and
the
lines
of
the
vegetable
fibres
were
plainly
discernible
these
sheets
were
covered
with
writing
halloa
cried
melick
why
this
is
english
at
this
the
others
crowded
around
to
look
on
and
featherstone
in
his
excitement
forgot
that
he
had
lost
his
bet
there
were
three
sheets
all
covered
with
writing
one
in
english
another
in
french
and
a
third
in
german
it
was
the
same
message
written
in
these
three
different
languages
but
at
that
moment
they
scarcely
noticed
this
all
that
they
saw
was
the
message
itself
with
its
mysterious
meaning
it
was
as
follows
to
the
finder
of
this
sir
i
am
an
englishman
and
have
been
carried
by
a
series
of
incredible
events
to
a
land
from
which
escape
is
as
impossible
as
from
the
grave
i
have
written
this
and
committed
it
to
the
sea
in
the
hope
that
the
ocean
currents
may
bear
it
within
the
reach
of
civilized
man
oh
unknown
friend
whoever
you
are
i
entreat
you
to
let
this
message
be
made
known
in
some
way
to
my
father
henry
more
keswick
cumberland
england
so
that
he
may
learn
the
fate
of
his
son
the
accompanying
this
contains
an
account
of
my
adventures
which
i
should
like
to
have
forwarded
to
him
do
this
for
the
sake
of
that
mercy
which
you
may
one
day
wish
to
have
shown
to
yourself
adam
more
by
jove
cried
featherstone
as
he
read
the
above
this
is
really
getting
to
be
something
tremendous
this
other
package
must
be
the
manuscript
said
oxenden
and
tell
all
about
it
such
a
manuscript
be
better
than
meat
said
the
doctor
sententiously
melick
said
nothing
but
opening
his
knife
he
cut
the
cords
and
unfolded
the
wrapper
he
saw
a
great
collection
of
leaves
just
like
those
of
the
letter
of
some
vegetable
substance
smooth
as
paper
and
covered
with
writing
it
looks
like
egyptian
papyrus
said
the
doctor
that
was
the
common
paper
of
antiquity
never
mind
the
egyptian
papyrus
said
featherstone
in
feverish
curiosity
let
have
the
contents
of
the
manuscript
you
melick
read
you
the
most
energetic
of
the
lot
and
when
you
tired
the
rest
of
us
will
take
turns
read
why
it
take
a
month
to
read
all
this
said
melick
all
the
better
said
featherstone
this
calm
will
probably
last
a
month
and
we
shall
have
nothing
to
interest
us
melick
made
no
further
objection
he
was
as
excited
as
the
rest
and
so
he
began
the
reading
of
the
manuscript
chapter
ii
adrift
in
the
antarctic
ocean
my
name
is
adam
more
i
am
the
son
of
henry
more
apothecary
keswick
cumberland
i
was
mate
of
the
ship
trevelyan
bennet
master
which
was
chartered
by
the
british
government
to
convey
convicts
to
van
dieman
land
this
was
in
we
made
our
voyage
without
any
casualty
landed
our
convicts
in
hobart
town
and
then
set
forth
on
our
return
home
it
was
the
of
december
when
we
left
from
the
first
adverse
winds
prevailed
and
in
order
to
make
any
progress
we
were
obliged
to
keep
well
to
the
south
at
length
on
the
of
january
we
sighted
desolation
island
we
found
it
indeed
a
desolate
spot
in
its
vicinity
we
saw
a
multitude
of
smaller
islands
perhaps
a
thousand
in
number
which
made
navigation
difficult
and
forced
us
to
hurry
away
as
fast
as
possible
but
the
aspect
of
this
dreary
spot
was
of
itself
enough
to
repel
us
there
were
no
trees
and
the
multitude
of
islands
seemed
like
rocks
while
the
temperature
though
in
the
middle
of
the
antarctic
summer
was
from
to
degrees
fahr
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
dangerous
islands
we
stood
south
and
west
and
at
length
found
ourselves
in
south
latitude
degrees
longitude
degrees
east
we
were
fortunate
enough
not
to
find
any
ice
although
we
were
within
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
the
south
pole
and
far
within
that
impenetrable
icy
barrier
which
in
had
arrested
the
progress
of
captain
cook
here
the
wind
failed
us
and
we
lay
becalmed
and
drifting
the
sea
was
open
all
around
us
except
to
the
southeast
where
there
was
a
low
line
along
the
horizon
terminating
in
a
lofty
promontory
but
though
it
looked
like
land
we
took
it
for
ice
all
around
us
whales
and
grampuses
were
gambolling
and
spouting
in
vast
numbers
the
weather
was
remarkably
fine
and
clear
for
two
or
three
days
the
calm
continued
and
we
drifted
along
helplessly
until
at
length
we
found
ourselves
within
a
few
miles
of
the
promontory
above
mentioned
it
looked
like
land
and
seemed
to
be
a
rocky
island
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
it
was
however
all
covered
with
ice
and
snow
and
from
this
there
extended
eastward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
an
interminable
line
of
ice
but
toward
the
southwest
the
sea
seemed
open
to
navigation
the
promontory
was
very
singular
in
shape
rising
up
to
a
peak
which
was
at
least
a
thousand
feet
in
height
and
forming
a
striking
object
easily
discovered
and
readily
identified
by
any
future
explorer
we
named
it
after
our
ship
trevelyan
peak
and
then
felt
anxious
to
lose
sight
of
it
forever
but
the
calm
continued
and
at
length
we
drifted
in
close
enough
to
see
immense
flocks
of
seals
dotting
the
ice
at
the
foot
of
the
peak
upon
this
i
proposed
to
agnew
the
second
mate
that
we
should
go
ashore
shoot
some
seals
and
bring
them
back
this
was
partly
for
the
excitement
of
the
hunt
and
partly
for
the
honor
of
landing
in
a
place
never
before
trodden
by
the
foot
of
man
captain
bennet
made
some
objections
but
he
was
old
and
cautious
and
we
were
young
and
venturesome
so
we
laughed
away
his
scruples
and
set
forth
we
did
not
take
any
of
the
crew
owing
to
the
captain
objections
he
said
that
if
we
chose
to
throw
away
our
own
lives
he
could
not
help
it
but
that
he
would
positively
refuse
to
allow
a
single
man
to
go
with
us
we
thought
this
refusal
an
excess
of
caution
amounting
to
positive
cowardice
but
were
unable
to
change
his
mind
the
distance
was
not
great
the
adventure
was
attractive
and
so
the
captain
gig
was
lowered
and
in
this
agnew
and
i
rowed
ashore
we
took
with
us
a
rifle
apiece
and
also
a
pistol
agnew
took
a
glass
we
rowed
for
about
three
miles
and
reached
the
edge
of
the
ice
which
extended
far
out
from
the
promontory
here
we
landed
and
secured
the
boat
by
means
of
a
small
which
we
thrust
into
the
ice
we
then
walked
toward
the
promontory
for
about
a
mile
and
here
we
found
a
multitude
of
seals
these
animals
were
so
fearless
that
they
made
not
the
slightest
movement
as
we
came
up
but
stared
at
us
in
an
indifferent
way
we
killed
two
or
three
and
then
debated
whether
to
go
to
the
promontory
or
not
agnew
was
eager
to
go
so
as
to
touch
the
actual
rock
but
i
was
satisfied
with
what
we
had
done
and
was
now
desirous
of
returning
in
the
midst
of
this
i
felt
a
flake
of
snow
on
my
cheek
i
started
and
looked
up
to
my
great
surprise
i
saw
that
the
sky
had
changed
since
i
had
last
noticed
it
when
we
left
the
ship
it
was
clear
and
blue
but
now
it
was
overspread
with
dark
clouds
and
the
that
had
fallen
were
ominous
of
evil
a
here
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ice
was
too
serious
a
thing
to
be
disregarded
but
one
course
now
remained
and
that
was
an
immediate
return
to
the
ship
each
of
us
seized
a
seal
and
dragged
it
after
us
to
the
boat
we
reached
it
and
flung
them
in
just
at
that
moment
a
gun
sounded
over
the
water
it
was
from
the
ship
the
signal
of
alarm
the
summons
from
the
captain
for
our
return
we
saw
now
that
she
had
been
drifting
since
we
left
her
and
had
moved
southwest
several
miles
the
row
back
promised
to
be
far
harder
than
the
pull
ashore
and
what
was
worse
the
wind
was
coming
up
the
sea
was
rising
and
the
snow
was
thickening
neither
of
us
said
a
word
we
saw
that
our
situation
was
very
serious
and
that
we
had
been
very
foolhardy
but
the
words
were
useless
now
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
pull
for
the
ship
with
all
our
strength
and
that
was
what
we
did
so
we
pushed
off
and
rowed
as
we
had
never
rowed
before
our
progress
was
difficult
the
sea
grew
steadily
rougher
the
wind
increased
the
snow
thickened
and
worst
of
all
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
we
had
miscalculated
both
as
to
distance
and
time
even
if
it
had
continued
calm
we
should
have
had
to
row
back
in
the
dark
but
now
the
sun
was
setting
and
with
the
darkness
we
had
to
encounter
the
gathering
storm
and
the
blinding
snow
we
rowed
in
silence
at
every
stroke
our
situation
grew
more
serious
the
wind
was
from
the
south
and
therefore
favored
us
to
some
extent
and
also
made
less
of
a
sea
than
would
have
been
produced
by
a
wind
from
any
other
quarter
but
then
this
south
wind
brought
dangers
of
its
own
which
we
were
soon
to
feel
new
dangers
and
worse
ones
for
this
south
wind
drove
the
ship
farther
from
us
and
at
the
same
time
broke
up
the
vast
fields
of
ice
and
impelled
the
fractured
masses
northward
but
this
was
a
danger
which
we
did
not
know
just
then
at
that
time
we
were
rowing
for
the
ship
and
amid
the
darkness
and
the
blinding
snow
and
the
dashing
waves
we
heard
from
time
to
time
the
report
of
fired
from
the
ship
to
guide
us
back
these
were
our
only
guide
for
the
darkness
and
the
snow
had
drawn
the
ship
from
our
sight
and
we
had
to
be
guided
by
our
hearing
only
we
were
rowing
for
our
lives
and
we
knew
it
but
every
moment
our
situation
grew
more
desperate
each
new
report
of
the
gun
seemed
to
sound
farther
away
we
seemed
always
to
be
rowing
in
the
wrong
direction
at
each
report
we
had
to
shift
the
boat
course
somewhat
and
pull
toward
the
last
point
from
which
the
gun
seemed
to
sound
with
all
this
the
wind
was
increasing
rapidly
to
a
gale
the
sea
was
rising
and
breaking
over
the
boat
the
snow
was
blinding
us
with
its
sleet
the
darkness
deepened
and
at
length
had
grown
so
intense
that
nothing
whatever
could
be
seen
neither
sea
nor
sky
not
even
the
boat
itself
yet
we
dared
not
stop
we
had
to
row
our
lives
depended
on
our
efforts
we
had
to
row
guided
by
the
sound
of
the
ship
gun
which
the
wind
incessantly
changed
till
our
minds
grew
all
confused
and
we
rowed
blindly
and
mechanically
so
we
labored
for
hours
at
the
oars
and
the
storm
continually
increased
and
the
sea
continually
rose
while
the
snow
fell
thicker
and
the
darkness
grew
intenser
the
reports
of
the
gun
now
grew
fainter
what
was
worse
they
were
heard
at
longer
intervals
and
this
showed
us
that
captain
bennet
was
losing
heart
that
he
was
giving
us
up
that
he
despaired
of
finding
us
and
was
now
firing
only
an
occasional
gun
out
of
a
mournful
sense
of
duty
this
thought
reduced
us
to
despair
it
seemed
as
if
all
our
efforts
had
only
served
to
take
us
farther
away
from
the
ship
and
deprived
us
of
all
motive
for
rowing
any
harder
than
was
barely
necessary
to
keep
the
boat
steady
after
a
time
agnew
dropped
his
oar
and
began
to
bail
out
the
boat
a
work
which
was
needed
for
in
spite
of
our
care
she
had
shipped
many
seas
and
was
one
third
full
of
water
he
worked
away
at
this
while
i
managed
the
boat
and
then
we
took
turns
at
bailing
in
this
way
we
passed
the
dreary
night
morning
came
at
last
the
wind
was
not
so
violent
but
the
snow
was
so
thick
that
we
could
only
see
for
a
little
distance
around
us
the
ship
was
nowhere
visible
nor
were
there
any
signs
of
her
the
last
gun
had
been
fired
during
the
night
all
that
we
could
see
was
the
outline
of
a
gaunt
iceberg
an
ominous
spectacle
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
we
rowed
on
as
before
keeping
in
what
seemed
our
best
course
though
this
was
mere
conjecture
and
we
knew
all
the
time
that
we
might
be
going
wrong
there
was
no
compass
in
the
boat
nor
could
we
tell
the
sun
position
through
the
thick
snow
we
rowed
with
the
wind
thinking
that
it
was
blowing
toward
the
north
and
would
carry
us
in
that
direction
we
still
hoped
to
come
within
sound
of
the
ship
gun
and
kept
straining
our
ears
incessantly
to
hear
the
report
but
no
such
sound
ever
came
again
and
we
heard
nothing
except
the
plash
of
the
waves
and
the
crash
of
breaking
ice
thus
all
that
day
we
rowed
along
resting
at
intervals
when
exhausted
and
then
resuming
our
labors
until
at
length
night
came
and
again
to
the
snow
and
ice
and
waves
was
added
the
horror
of
great
darkness
we
passed
that
night
in
deep
misery
we
had
eaten
nothing
since
we
left
the
ship
but
though
exhausted
by
long
fasting
and
severe
labor
the
despair
of
our
hearts
took
away
all
desire
for
food
we
were
worn
out
with
hard
work
yet
the
cold
was
too
great
to
allow
us
to
take
rest
and
we
were
compelled
to
row
so
as
to
keep
ourselves
from
perishing
but
fatigue
and
drowsiness
overcame
us
and
we
often
sank
into
sleep
even
while
rowing
and
then
after
a
brief
slumber
we
would
awake
with
benumbed
limbs
to
wrestle
again
with
the
oars
in
this
way
we
passed
that
night
another
morning
came
and
we
found
to
our
great
joy
that
the
snow
had
ceased
we
looked
eagerly
around
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
the
ship
nothing
could
be
seen
of
her
far
away
on
one
side
rose
a
peak
which
looked
like
the
place
where
we
had
landed
judging
from
the
wind
which
we
still
supposed
to
be
southerly
the
peak
lay
toward
the
northeast
in
which
case
we
had
been
carried
steadily
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
toward
the
south
about
a
mile
on
one
side
of
us
the
ice
began
and
extended
far
away
while
on
the
other
side
at
the
distance
of
some
ten
miles
there
was
another
line
of
ice
we
seemed
to
have
been
carried
in
a
southwesterly
direction
along
a
broad
strait
that
ran
into
the
vast
this
discovery
showed
how
utterly
useless
our
labors
had
been
for
in
spite
of
all
even
with
the
wind
in
our
favor
we
had
been
drawn
steadily
in
an
opposite
direction
it
was
evident
that
there
was
some
current
here
stronger
than
all
our
strength
which
had
brought
us
to
this
place
we
now
determined
to
land
on
the
ice
and
try
to
cook
a
portion
of
our
seals
on
approaching
it
we
noticed
that
there
was
a
current
which
tended
to
draw
us
past
the
ice
in
what
i
supposed
to
be
a
southwesterly
direction
this
confirmed
my
worst
fears
but
now
the
labor
of
landing
and
building
a
fire
on
the
ice
served
to
interest
us
for
a
time
and
divert
our
thoughts
we
brushed
away
the
snow
and
then
broke
up
a
box
which
was
in
the
boat
and
also
the
stern
seats
this
we
used
very
sparingly
reserving
the
rest
for
another
occasion
then
we
cut
portions
from
one
of
the
seals
and
laid
them
in
thin
strips
on
the
flames
the
cooking
was
but
slight
for
the
meat
was
merely
singed
but
we
were
ravenous
and
the
contact
of
the
fire
was
enough
to
give
it
an
attractive
flavor
with
this
food
we
were
greatly
refreshed
and
as
for
drink
we
had
all
around
us
an
endless
extent
of
ice
and
snow
then
taking
our
precious
fragments
of
cooked
meat
we
returned
to
the
boat
and
put
off
we
could
scarcely
tell
what
to
do
next
and
while
debating
on
this
point
we
fell
asleep
we
slept
far
into
the
night
then
awoke
benumbed
with
cold
then
took
to
the
oars
till
we
were
weary
then
fell
asleep
again
to
be
again
awakened
by
the
cold
and
again
to
pull
at
the
oars
so
the
night
passed
and
another
day
came
the
snow
still
held
off
but
the
sky
was
overcast
with
dark
clouds
and
looked
threatening
ice
was
all
around
us
as
before
and
the
open
water
had
diminished
now
from
ten
miles
to
five
miles
of
width
the
ice
on
one
side
was
low
but
on
the
opposite
side
it
arose
to
the
height
of
one
hundred
feet
we
saw
here
as
we
watched
the
shore
that
the
current
which
had
already
borne
us
thus
far
was
now
stronger
than
ever
and
was
carrying
us
along
at
a
rate
which
made
all
efforts
of
ours
against
it
utterly
useless
and
now
a
debate
arose
between
us
as
to
the
direction
of
this
current
agnew
suddenly
declared
his
belief
that
it
was
running
north
while
i
was
firm
in
the
conviction
that
it
ran
south
there
no
use
rowing
any
more
said
agnew
if
it
runs
south
we
ca
resist
it
it
too
strong
but
i
always
like
to
look
on
the
bright
side
and
so
i
believe
it
runs
north
in
that
case
there
is
no
use
rowing
for
it
will
carry
us
along
fast
enough
then
i
proposed
that
we
should
go
ashore
on
the
ice
to
this
agnew
objected
but
afterward
consented
at
my
earnest
request
so
we
tried
to
get
ashore
but
this
time
found
it
impossible
for
the
ice
consisted
of
a
vast
sheet
of
floating
lumps
which
looked
like
the
ruin
of
bergs
that
had
been
broken
up
in
some
storm
after
this
i
had
nothing
to
say
nor
was
there
anything
left
for
us
but
to
drift
wherever
the
current
might
carry
us
so
we
drifted
for
some
days
agnew
all
the
time
maintaining
that
we
were
going
north
while
i
was
sure
that
we
were
going
south
the
sky
remained
as
cloudy
as
ever
the
wind
varied
incessantly
and
there
was
nothing
by
which
we
could
conjecture
the
points
of
the
compass
we
lived
on
our
seal
and
for
drink
we
chewed
ice
and
snow
one
thing
was
certain
the
climate
was
no
colder
agnew
laid
great
stress
on
this
you
see
said
he
we
must
be
going
north
if
we
were
going
south
we
should
be
frozen
stiff
by
this
time
yes
but
if
we
were
going
north
said
i
we
ought
to
find
it
growing
warmer
no
said
he
not
with
all
this
ice
around
us
it
the
ice
that
keeps
the
temperature
in
this
cold
state
argument
could
do
no
good
and
so
we
each
remained
true
to
our
belief
his
leading
him
to
hope
and
mine
dragging
me
down
to
despair
at
length
we
finished
the
last
fragment
of
the
seal
that
we
had
cooked
and
finding
ourselves
near
some
firm
ice
we
went
ashore
and
cooked
all
that
was
left
using
the
remainder
of
our
wood
for
fuel
and
all
that
we
dared
to
remove
from
the
boat
with
this
we
drifted
on
as
before
several
more
days
passed
at
last
one
night
i
was
roused
by
agnew
he
pointed
far
away
to
the
distant
horizon
where
i
saw
a
deep
red
glow
as
of
fire
we
were
both
filled
with
wonder
at
the
sight
and
were
utterly
unable
to
account
for
it
we
knew
that
it
could
not
be
caused
by
the
sun
or
the
moon
for
it
was
midnight
and
the
cause
lay
on
the
earth
and
not
in
the
skies
it
was
a
deep
lurid
glow
extending
along
the
horizon
and
seemed
to
be
caused
by
some
vast
conflagration
chapter
iii
a
world
of
fire
and
desolation
at
the
sight
of
that
glow
various
feelings
arose
within
us
in
me
there
was
new
dejection
in
agnew
there
was
stronger
hope
i
could
not
think
but
that
it
was
our
ship
that
was
on
fire
and
was
burning
before
our
eyes
agnew
thought
that
it
was
some
burning
forest
and
that
it
showed
our
approach
to
some
habitable
and
inhabited
land
for
hour
after
hour
we
watched
and
all
the
time
the
current
drew
us
nearer
and
the
glow
grew
brighter
and
more
intense
at
last
we
were
too
weak
to
watch
any
longer
and
we
fell
asleep
on
waking
our
first
thoughts
were
about
the
fire
and
we
looked
eagerly
around
it
was
day
but
the
sky
was
as
gloomy
as
ever
and
the
fire
was
there
before
our
eyes
bright
and
terrible
we
could
now
see
it
plainly
and
discern
the
cause
also
the
fire
came
from
two
points
at
some
distance
apart
two
peaks
rising
above
the
horizon
from
which
there
burst
forth
flames
and
smoke
with
incessant
explosions
all
was
now
manifest
it
was
no
burning
ship
no
blazing
forest
no
land
inhabited
by
man
those
blazing
peaks
were
two
volcanoes
in
a
state
of
active
eruption
and
at
that
sight
i
knew
the
worst
i
know
where
we
are
now
i
said
despairingly
where
asked
agnew
that
said
i
is
the
antarctic
continent
the
antarctic
fiddlestick
said
he
contemptuously
it
is
far
more
likely
to
be
some
volcanic
island
in
the
south
sea
there
a
tremendous
volcano
in
the
sandwich
islands
and
these
are
something
like
it
i
believe
said
i
that
these
are
the
very
volcanoes
that
sir
james
ross
discovered
last
year
do
you
happen
to
know
where
he
found
them
agnew
asked
i
do
not
i
answered
well
i
do
said
he
and
they
thousands
of
miles
away
from
this
they
are
south
latitude
degrees
east
longitude
degrees
while
we
as
i
guess
are
about
south
latitude
degrees
east
longitude
degrees
at
any
rate
said
i
we
drifting
straight
toward
them
so
i
see
said
agnew
dryly
at
any
rate
the
current
will
take
us
somewhere
we
shall
find
ourselves
carried
past
these
volcanic
islands
or
through
them
and
then
west
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
besides
even
here
we
may
find
land
with
animals
and
vegetation
who
knows
what
amid
all
this
ice
i
cried
are
you
mad
mad
said
he
i
should
certainly
go
mad
if
i
had
hope
hope
i
repeated
i
have
long
since
given
up
hope
oh
well
said
he
enjoy
your
despair
and
do
try
to
deprive
me
of
my
consolation
my
hope
sustains
me
and
helps
me
to
cheer
you
up
it
would
never
do
old
fellow
for
both
of
us
to
knock
under
i
said
nothing
more
nor
did
agnew
we
drifted
on
and
all
our
thoughts
were
taken
up
with
the
two
volcanoes
toward
which
we
were
every
moment
drawing
nearer
as
we
approached
they
grew
larger
and
larger
towering
up
to
a
tremendous
height
i
had
seen
vesuvius
and
stromboli
and
aetna
and
cotopaxi
but
these
appeared
far
larger
than
any
of
them
not
excepting
the
last
they
rose
like
the
peak
of
teneriffe
abruptly
from
the
sea
with
no
intervening
hills
to
dwarf
or
diminish
their
proportions
they
were
ten
or
twelve
miles
apart
and
the
channel
of
water
in
which
we
were
drifting
flowed
between
them
here
the
ice
and
snow
ended
we
thus
came
at
last
to
land
but
it
was
a
land
that
seemed
more
terrible
than
even
the
bleak
expanse
of
ice
and
snow
that
lay
behind
for
nothing
could
be
seen
except
a
vast
and
drear
accumulation
of
of
every
imaginable
shape
without
a
trace
of
vegetation
uninhabited
uninhabitable
and
unpassable
to
man
but
just
where
the
ice
ended
and
the
rocks
began
there
was
a
long
low
reef
which
projected
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
into
the
water
affording
the
only
possible
within
sight
here
we
decided
to
land
so
as
to
rest
and
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
here
we
landed
and
walked
up
to
where
rugged
prevented
any
further
progress
but
at
this
spot
our
attention
was
suddenly
arrested
by
a
sight
of
horror
it
was
a
human
figure
lying
prostrate
face
downward
at
this
sight
there
came
over
us
a
terrible
sensation
even
buoyant
soul
shrank
back
and
we
stared
at
each
other
with
quivering
lips
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
recover
ourselves
then
we
went
to
the
figure
and
stooped
down
to
examine
it
the
clothes
were
those
of
a
european
and
a
sailor
the
frame
was
emaciated
and
dried
up
till
it
looked
like
a
skeleton
the
face
was
blackened
and
all
withered
and
the
bony
hands
were
clinched
tight
it
was
evidently
some
sailor
who
had
suffered
shipwreck
in
these
frightful
solitudes
and
had
drifted
here
to
starve
to
death
in
this
appalling
wilderness
it
was
a
sight
which
seemed
ominous
of
our
own
fate
and
agnew
boasted
hope
which
had
so
long
upheld
him
now
sank
down
into
a
despair
as
deep
as
my
own
what
room
was
there
now
for
hope
or
how
could
we
expect
any
other
fate
than
this
at
length
i
began
to
search
the
pockets
of
the
deceased
what
are
you
doing
asked
agnew
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
trying
to
find
out
who
he
is
i
said
perhaps
there
may
be
papers
as
i
said
this
i
felt
something
in
the
of
his
jacket
and
drew
it
forth
it
was
a
leather
mouldy
and
rotten
like
the
clothing
on
opening
it
it
fell
to
pieces
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
a
piece
of
paper
also
mouldy
and
rotten
this
i
unfolded
with
great
care
and
saw
writing
there
which
though
faded
was
still
legible
it
was
a
letter
and
there
were
still
signs
of
long
and
frequent
perusals
and
marks
too
which
looked
as
though
made
by
tears
tears
perhaps
of
the
writer
perhaps
of
the
reader
who
can
tell
i
have
preserved
this
letter
ever
since
and
i
now
fasten
it
here
upon
this
sheet
of
my
manuscript
the
letter

together
your
loving
wife
polley
reed
i
began
to
read
this
but
there
came
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
i
had
to
stop
agnew
leaned
on
my
shoulder
and
we
both
read
it
in
silence
he
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
drew
a
long
breath
then
he
walked
away
for
a
little
distance
and
i
put
the
letter
carefully
away
in
my
own
after
a
little
while
agnew
came
back
more
said
he
do
you
remember
any
of
the
i
understood
his
meaning
at
once
yes
i
said
some
of
it
a
good
deal
of
it
i
think
that
good
said
he
let
put
the
poor
fellow
under
ground
it
would
be
hard
to
do
that
i
said
we
have
to
bury
him
in
the
snow
at
this
agnew
went
off
for
a
little
distance
and
clambered
over
the
rocks
he
was
not
gone
long
when
he
returned
he
said
i
found
some
crumbled
we
can
scoop
a
grave
for
him
there
we
then
raised
the
body
and
carried
it
to
the
place
which
agnew
had
found
so
emaciated
was
the
poor
dead
sailor
that
his
remains
were
no
heavier
than
a
small
boy
on
reaching
the
spot
we
found
the
crumbled
we
placed
the
body
in
a
crevice
among
the
lava
rocks
and
then
i
said
what
i
could
remember
of
the
after
this
we
carried
in
our
hands
the
crumbled
until
we
had
covered
the
body
and
thus
gave
the
poor
fellow
a
christian
burial
we
then
returned
to
the
shore
more
old
fellow
said
agnew
i
feel
the
better
for
this
the
service
has
done
me
good
and
me
too
said
i
it
has
reminded
me
of
what
i
had
forgotten
this
world
is
only
a
part
of
life
we
may
lose
it
and
yet
live
on
there
is
another
world
and
if
we
can
only
keep
that
in
our
minds
we
be
so
ready
to
sink
into
despair
that
is
i
despair
is
my
weakness
you
are
more
hopeful
yes
said
agnew
solemnly
but
my
hope
thus
far
has
referred
only
to
the
safety
of
my
skin
after
this
i
shall
try
to
think
of
my
soul
and
cultivate
not
the
hope
of
escape
but
the
hope
full
of
immortality
yes
more
after
all
we
shall
live
if
not
in
england
then
let
us
hope
in
heaven
there
was
a
long
silence
after
this
that
kind
of
silence
which
one
may
preserve
who
is
at
the
point
of
death
i
wonder
how
he
got
here
said
agnew
at
last
the
letter
mentions
a
whaler
no
doubt
the
ship
has
been
driven
too
far
south
it
has
foundered
he
has
escaped
in
a
boat
either
alone
or
with
others
he
has
been
carried
along
this
channel
and
has
landed
here
afraid
to
go
any
farther
but
his
boat
what
has
become
of
that
his
boat
that
must
have
gone
long
ago
the
letter
was
written
in
at
any
rate
let
look
around
we
did
so
after
some
search
we
found
fragments
of
a
rotted
rope
attached
to
a
piece
of
rock
that
said
agnew
must
have
been
fastened
to
the
boat
and
as
for
the
boat
herself
she
has
long
ago
been
swept
away
from
this
what
shall
we
do
now
i
said
after
a
long
silence
there
only
one
thing
said
agnew
we
must
go
on
go
on
i
asked
in
wonder
certainly
said
he
confidently
will
you
stay
here
no
will
you
go
back
you
ca
we
must
therefore
go
on
that
is
our
only
hope
hope
i
cried
do
you
still
talk
of
hope
hope
said
agnew
of
course
why
not
there
are
no
limits
to
hope
are
there
one
can
hope
anything
anywhere
it
is
better
to
die
while
struggling
like
a
man
full
of
hope
and
energy
than
to
perish
in
inaction
and
despair
it
is
better
to
die
in
the
storm
and
furious
waters
than
to
waste
away
in
this
awful
place
so
come
along
drift
as
before
let
see
where
this
channel
will
take
us
it
will
certainly
take
us
somewhere
such
a
stream
as
this
must
have
some
outlet
this
stream
said
i
will
take
us
to
death
and
death
only
the
current
grows
swifter
every
hour
i
heard
some
old
yarn
of
a
vast
opening
at
each
of
the
poles
or
one
of
them
into
which
the
waters
of
the
ocean
pour
they
fall
into
one
and
some
say
they
go
through
and
come
out
at
the
other
agnew
laughed
that
said
he
is
a
madman
dream
in
the
first
place
i
believe
that
we
are
approaching
the
south
but
the
north
the
warmth
of
the
climate
here
shows
that
yes
we
are
drawing
north
we
shall
soon
emerge
into
warm
waters
and
bright
skies
so
come
along
and
let
us
lose
no
more
time
i
made
no
further
objection
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
at
the
very
worst
we
could
not
be
in
greater
danger
while
drifting
on
than
in
remaining
behind
soon
therefore
we
were
again
in
the
boat
and
the
current
swept
us
on
as
before
the
channel
now
was
about
four
miles
wide
on
either
side
arose
the
lofty
volcanoes
vomiting
forth
flames
and
smoke
with
furious
explosions
vast
stones
were
hurled
up
into
the
air
from
the
craters
streams
of
molten
lava
rolled
down
and
at
intervals
there
fell
great
showers
of
ashes
the
shores
on
either
side
were
precipitous
and
rugged
beyond
all
description
looking
like
fiery
lava
streams
which
had
been
arrested
by
the
flood
and
cooled
into
gloomy
overhanging
cliffs
the
lava
rock
was
of
a
deep
dull
which
at
a
distance
looked
black
and
the
blackness
which
thus
succeeded
to
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
behind
us
seemed
like
the
funeral
pall
of
nature
through
scenes
like
these
we
drifted
on
and
the
volcanoes
on
either
side
of
the
channel
towered
on
high
with
their
fiery
floods
of
lava
their
incessant
explosions
their
fierce
outbursts
of
flames
and
overhead
there
rolled
a
dense
black
canopy
of
smoke
altogether
forming
a
terrific
approach
to
that
unknown
and
awful
pathway
upon
which
we
were
going
so
we
passed
this
dread
portal
and
then
there
lay
before
us
what
was
it
a
land
of
life
or
a
land
of
death
who
could
say
it
was
evening
when
we
passed
through
night
came
on
and
the
darkness
was
illuminated
by
the
fiery
glow
of
the
volcanic
flames
worn
out
with
fatigue
we
fell
asleep
so
the
night
passed
and
the
current
bore
us
on
until
at
length
the
morning
came
we
awoke
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
we
saw
the
face
of
the
sun
the
clouds
had
at
last
broken
the
sky
was
clear
and
behind
us
the
sun
was
shining
that
sight
told
us
all
it
showed
us
where
we
were
going
i
pointed
to
the
sun
look
there
said
i
there
is
the
sun
in
the
northern
sky
behind
us
we
have
been
drifting
steadily
toward
the
south
at
this
agnew
was
silent
and
sat
looking
back
for
a
long
time
there
we
could
still
see
the
glow
of
the
volcanic
fires
though
they
were
now
many
miles
away
while
the
sun
but
lately
risen
was
lying
on
a
course
closer
to
the
horizon
than
we
had
ever
seen
it
before
we
are
going
south
said
i
to
the
south
pole
this
swift
current
can
have
but
one
ending
there
may
be
an
opening
at
the
south
pole
or
a
whirlpool
like
the
maelstrom
agnew
looked
around
with
a
smile
all
these
notions
said
he
are
dreams
or
theories
or
guesses
there
is
no
evidence
to
prove
them
why
trouble
yourself
about
a
guess
you
and
i
can
guess
and
with
better
reason
for
we
have
now
it
seems
come
farther
south
than
any
human
being
who
has
ever
lived
do
not
imagine
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
different
at
the
poles
from
what
it
is
anywhere
else
if
we
get
to
the
south
pole
we
shall
see
there
what
we
have
always
seen
the
open
view
of
land
or
water
and
the
boundary
of
the
horizon
as
for
this
current
it
seems
to
me
like
the
gulf
stream
and
it
evidently
does
an
important
work
in
the
movement
of
the
ocean
waters
it
pours
on
through
vast
fields
of
ice
on
its
way
to
other
oceans
where
it
will
probably
become
united
with
new
currents
theories
about
openings
at
the
poles
or
whirlpools
must
be
given
up
since
the
maelstrom
has
been
found
to
be
a
fiction
no
one
need
believe
in
any
other
whirlpool
for
my
own
part
i
now
believe
that
this
current
will
bear
us
on
due
south
over
the
pole
and
then
still
onward
until
at
last
we
shall
find
ourselves
in
the
south
pacific
ocean
so
cheer
up
do
be
downhearted
there
still
hope
we
have
left
the
ice
and
snow
behind
and
already
the
air
is
warmer
cheer
up
we
may
find
our
luck
turn
at
any
moment
to
this
i
had
no
reply
to
make
agnew
confidence
seemed
to
me
to
be
assumed
and
certainly
did
not
alleviate
my
own
deep
gloom
nor
was
the
scene
around
calculated
to
rouse
me
in
the
slightest
degree
out
of
my
despair
the
channel
had
now
lessened
to
a
width
of
not
more
than
two
miles
the
shores
on
either
side
were
precipitous
cliffs
broken
by
occasional
declivities
but
all
of
solid
rock
so
dark
as
to
be
almost
black
and
evidently
of
volcanic
origin
at
times
there
arose
rugged
eminences
scarred
and
riven
indescribably
dismal
and
appalling
there
was
not
only
an
utter
absence
of
life
here
in
these
abhorrent
regions
but
an
actual
impossibility
of
life
which
was
enough
to
make
the
stoutest
heart
quail
the
rocks
looked
like
iron
it
seemed
a
land
of
iron
penetrated
by
this
ocean
stream
which
had
made
for
itself
a
channel
and
now
bore
us
onward
to
a
destination
which
was
beyond
all
conjecture
through
such
scenes
we
drifted
all
that
day
night
came
and
in
the
skies
overhead
there
arose
a
brilliant
display
of
the
aurora
australis
while
toward
the
north
the
volcanic
fires
glowed
with
intense
lustre
that
night
we
slept
on
awakening
we
noticed
a
change
in
the
scene
the
shores
though
still
black
and
forbidding
were
no
longer
precipitous
but
sloped
down
gradually
to
the
water
the
climate
was
sensibly
milder
and
far
away
before
us
there
arose
a
line
of
giant
mountains
whose
summits
were
covered
with
ice
and
snow
that
gleamed
white
and
purple
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
suddenly
agnew
gave
a
cry
and
pointed
to
the
opposite
shore
look
he
cried
do
you
see
they
are
men
i
looked
and
there
i
saw
plainly
some
moving
figures
that
were
beyond
a
doubt
human
beings
chapter
iv
the
sight
of
human
beings
the
sight
of
human
beings
thus
unexpectedly
found
filled
us
with
strange
feelings
feelings
which
i
can
not
explain
the
country
was
still
and
dark
and
forbidding
and
the
stream
ran
on
in
a
strong
current
deep
black
as
ink
and
resistless
as
fate
the
sky
behind
was
lighted
up
by
the
volcanic
glare
which
still
shone
from
afar
and
in
front
the
view
was
bounded
by
the
icy
heights
of
a
mountain
chain
here
was
indeed
a
strange
country
for
a
human
habitation
and
strange
indeed
were
the
human
beings
whom
we
saw
shall
we
land
said
agnew
oh
no
said
i
do
be
hasty
the
elements
are
sometimes
kinder
than
men
and
i
feel
safer
here
even
in
this
river
of
death
than
ashore
with
such
creatures
as
those
agnew
made
no
reply
we
watched
the
figures
on
the
shore
we
saw
them
coming
down
staring
and
gesticulating
we
drew
on
nearer
to
them
till
we
were
able
to
see
them
better
a
nearer
view
did
not
improve
them
they
were
human
beings
certainly
but
of
such
an
appalling
aspect
that
they
could
only
be
likened
to
animated
mummies
they
were
small
thin
shrivelled
black
with
long
matted
hair
and
hideous
faces
they
all
had
long
spears
and
wore
about
the
waist
short
skirts
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
the
skin
of
some
we
could
not
imagine
how
these
creatures
lived
or
where
there
were
no
signs
of
vegetation
of
any
kind
not
a
tree
or
a
shrub
there
were
no
animals
but
there
were
great
flocks
of
birds
some
of
which
seemed
different
from
anything
that
we
had
ever
seen
before
the
long
spears
which
the
natives
carried
might
possibly
be
used
for
catching
these
or
for
fishing
purposes
this
thought
made
them
seem
less
formidable
since
they
would
thus
be
instruments
of
food
rather
than
weapons
of
war
meanwhile
we
drifted
on
as
before
and
the
natives
watched
us
running
along
the
shore
abreast
of
us
so
as
to
keep
up
with
the
boat
there
seemed
over
a
hundred
of
them
we
could
see
no
signs
of
any
habitations
no
huts
however
humble
but
we
concluded
that
their
abodes
were
farther
inland
as
for
the
natives
themselves
the
longer
we
looked
at
them
the
more
abhorrent
they
grew
even
the
wretched
aborigines
of
van
dieman
land
who
have
been
classed
lowest
in
the
scale
of
humanity
were
pleasing
and
congenial
when
compared
with
these
and
the
land
looked
worse
than
tierra
del
fuego
it
looked
like
a
land
of
iron
and
its
inhabitants
like
fiends
agnew
again
proposed
to
land
but
i
refused
no
i
said
i
rather
starve
for
a
week
and
live
on
hope
let
us
drift
on
if
we
go
on
we
may
have
hope
if
we
choose
but
if
we
land
here
we
shall
lose
even
that
can
we
hope
for
anything
from
such
things
as
these
even
if
they
prove
friendly
can
we
live
among
them
to
stay
here
is
worse
than
death
our
only
hope
is
to
go
on
agnew
made
no
reply
and
we
drifted
on
for
two
hours
still
followed
by
the
natives
they
made
no
hostile
demonstrations
they
merely
watched
us
apparently
from
motives
of
curiosity
all
this
time
we
were
drawing
steadily
nearer
to
the
line
of
lofty
mountains
which
with
their
icy
crests
rose
before
us
like
an
inaccessible
and
impassable
barrier
apparently
closing
up
all
farther
progress
nor
was
there
any
indication
of
any
pass
or
any
opening
however
narrow
through
which
the
great
stream
might
run
nothing
was
there
but
one
unbroken
wall
of
iron
cliffs
and
icy
summits
at
last
we
saw
that
the
sloping
shores
grew
steeper
until
about
a
mile
or
two
before
us
they
changed
to
towering
cliffs
that
rose
up
on
each
side
for
about
a
thousand
feet
above
the
water
here
the
stream
ran
and
became
lost
to
view
as
completely
as
though
swallowed
up
by
the
earth
we
can
go
no
farther
said
agnew
see
this
stream
seems
to
make
a
plunge
there
into
the
mountains
there
must
be
some
deep
canyon
there
with
cataracts
to
go
on
is
certain
death
we
must
stop
here
if
only
to
deliberate
say
shall
we
risk
it
among
these
natives
after
all
there
is
not
perhaps
any
danger
among
them
they
are
little
creatures
and
seem
harmless
they
are
certainly
not
very
but
then
you
know
appearances
often
deceive
and
the
devil
not
so
black
as
he
painted
what
do
you
say
i
suppose
we
can
do
nothing
else
said
i
in
fact
i
could
see
that
we
had
reached
a
crisis
in
our
fate
to
go
on
seemed
certain
death
to
stop
was
our
only
alternative
and
as
we
were
armed
we
should
not
be
altogether
at
the
mercy
of
these
creatures
having
made
this
decision
we
acted
upon
it
at
once
for
in
such
a
current
there
was
no
time
for
delay
and
so
seizing
the
oars
we
soon
brought
the
boat
ashore
as
we
approached
the
crowd
of
natives
stood
awaiting
us
and
looked
more
repulsive
than
ever
we
could
see
the
emaciation
of
their
bony
frames
their
toes
and
fingers
were
like
birds
claws
their
eyes
were
small
and
dull
and
weak
and
sunken
in
cavernous
hollows
from
which
they
looked
at
us
like
corpses
a
horrible
sight
they
stood
quietly
however
and
without
any
hostile
demonstration
holding
their
spears
carelessly
resting
upon
the
ground
i
do
like
the
looks
of
them
said
i
i
think
i
had
better
fire
a
gun
why
cried
agnew
for
heaven
sake
man
do
hurt
any
of
them
oh
no
said
i
i
only
mean
to
inspire
a
little
wholesome
respect
saying
this
i
fired
in
the
air
the
report
rang
out
with
long
echoes
and
as
the
smoke
swept
away
it
showed
us
all
the
natives
on
the
ground
they
had
seated
themselves
with
their
hands
crossed
on
their
laps
and
there
they
sat
looking
at
us
as
before
but
with
no
manifestation
of
fear
or
even
surprise
i
had
expected
to
see
them
run
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
this
puzzled
us
still
there
was
no
time
now
for
any
further
hesitation
the
current
was
sweeping
us
toward
the
chasm
between
the
cliffs
and
we
had
to
land
without
delay
this
we
did
and
as
i
had
another
barrel
still
loaded
and
a
pistol
i
felt
that
with
these
arms
and
those
of
agnew
we
should
be
able
to
defend
ourselves
it
was
in
this
state
of
mind
that
we
landed
and
secured
the
boat
by
means
of
the
the
natives
now
all
crowded
around
us
making
many
strange
gestures
which
we
did
not
understand
some
of
them
bowed
low
others
prostrated
themselves
on
the
whole
these
seemed
like
marks
of
respect
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
regarded
us
as
superior
beings
of
some
sort
it
was
evident
that
there
was
nothing
like
hostility
in
their
minds
at
the
same
time
the
closer
survey
which
i
now
made
of
them
filled
me
with
renewed
horror
their
meagre
frames
small
watery
eyes
hollow
cavernous
sockets
sunken
cheeks
protruding
teeth
fingers
and
withered
skins
all
made
them
look
more
than
ever
like
animated
mummies
and
i
shrank
from
them
involuntarily
as
one
shrinks
from
contact
with
a
corpse
agnew
however
was
very
different
and
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
no
repugnance
whatever
he
bowed
and
smiled
at
them
and
shook
hands
with
half
a
dozen
of
them
in
succession
the
was
a
new
thing
to
them
but
they
accepted
it
in
a
proper
spirit
and
renewed
their
bows
and
prostrations
after
this
they
all
offered
us
their
lances
this
certainly
seemed
like
an
act
of
peace
and
i
shook
my
head
and
declined
to
touch
them
but
agnew
accepted
one
of
them
and
offered
his
rifle
in
return
the
one
to
whom
he
offered
it
refused
to
take
it
he
seemed
immensely
gratified
because
agnew
had
taken
his
lance
and
the
others
seemed
disappointed
at
his
refusal
to
take
theirs
but
i
felt
my
heart
quake
as
i
saw
him
offer
his
rifle
and
still
more
when
he
offered
it
to
one
or
two
others
and
only
regained
my
composure
as
i
perceived
that
his
offer
was
refused
by
all
they
now
made
motions
to
us
to
follow
and
we
all
set
forth
together
my
dear
more
said
agnew
cheerily
they
not
a
bad
lot
they
mean
well
they
ca
help
their
looks
you
too
suspicious
and
reserved
let
make
friends
with
them
and
get
them
to
help
us
do
as
i
do
i
tried
to
but
found
it
impossible
for
my
repugnance
was
immovable
it
was
like
the
horror
which
one
feels
toward
rats
cockroaches
earwigs
or
serpents
it
was
something
that
defied
reason
these
creatures
seemed
like
human
vermin
we
marched
inland
for
about
half
a
mile
crossed
a
ridge
and
came
to
a
valley
or
rather
a
kind
of
hollow
at
the
other
side
of
which
we
found
a
cave
with
a
smouldering
fire
in
front
the
fire
was
made
of
coal
which
must
exist
here
somewhere
it
was
highly
bituminous
and
burned
with
a
great
blaze
the
day
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
far
away
i
could
see
the
lurid
glow
of
the
volcanoes
which
grew
brighter
as
the
day
declined
above
the
skies
twinkled
with
innumerable
stars
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
moan
of
rushing
waters
we
entered
the
cave
as
we
did
so
the
natives
heaped
coal
upon
the
fire
and
the
flames
arose
lighting
up
the
interior
we
found
here
a
number
of
women
and
children
who
looked
at
us
without
either
fear
or
curiosity
the
children
looked
like
little
dwarfs
the
women
were
hags
hideous
beyond
description
one
old
woman
in
particular
who
seemed
to
be
in
authority
was
actually
terrible
in
her
awful
and
repulsive
ugliness
a
nightmare
dream
never
furnished
forth
a
more
frightful
object
this
nightmare
hag
prostrated
herself
before
each
of
us
with
such
an
air
of
that
she
looked
as
though
she
wished
us
to
kill
her
at
once
the
rough
cave
the
red
light
of
the
fire
all
made
the
scene
more
awful
and
a
wild
thought
came
to
me
that
we
had
actually
reached
while
yet
living
the
infernal
world
and
that
this
was
the
abode
of
devils
yet
their
actions
it
must
be
confessed
were
far
from
devilish
everyone
seemed
eager
to
serve
us
some
spread
out
couches
formed
of
the
skins
of
birds
for
us
to
sit
on
others
attended
to
the
fire
others
offered
us
gifts
of
large
and
beautiful
feathers
together
with
numerous
trinkets
of
rare
and
curious
workmanship
this
kind
attention
on
their
part
was
a
great
puzzle
to
me
and
i
could
not
help
suspecting
that
beneath
all
this
there
must
be
some
sinister
design
resolving
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
i
quietly
reloaded
the
empty
barrel
of
my
rifle
and
watched
with
the
utmost
vigilance
as
for
agnew
he
took
it
all
in
the
most
unsuspicious
manner
he
made
signs
to
them
shook
hands
with
them
accepted
their
gifts
and
even
tried
to
do
the
agreeable
to
the
formidable
hags
and
the
around
him
he
soon
attracted
the
chief
attention
and
while
all
looked
admiringly
upon
him
i
was
left
to
languish
in
comparative
neglect
at
length
a
savory
odor
came
through
the
cave
and
a
repast
was
spread
before
us
it
consisted
of
some
large
fowl
that
looked
like
a
goose
but
was
twice
as
large
as
the
largest
turkey
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
taste
was
like
that
of
a
but
rather
fishy
still
to
us
it
seemed
delicious
for
our
prolonged
diet
of
raw
seal
had
made
us
ready
to
welcome
any
other
food
whatever
and
this
fowl
whatever
it
was
would
not
have
been
unwelcome
to
any
hungry
man
it
was
evident
that
these
people
lived
on
the
flesh
of
birds
of
various
sorts
all
around
us
we
saw
the
skins
of
birds
dried
with
the
feathers
on
and
used
for
clothing
for
mats
and
for
ornaments
the
repast
being
finished
we
both
felt
greatly
strengthened
and
refreshed
agnew
continued
to
cultivate
his
new
acquaintances
and
seeing
me
holding
back
he
said
more
old
fellow
these
good
people
give
me
to
understand
that
there
is
another
place
better
than
this
and
want
me
to
go
with
them
will
you
go
at
this
a
great
fear
seized
me
do
go
i
cried
do
go
we
are
close
by
the
boat
here
and
if
anything
happens
we
can
easily
get
to
it
agnew
laughed
in
my
face
why
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
said
he
that
you
are
still
suspicious
and
after
that
dinner
why
man
if
they
wanted
to
harm
us
would
they
feast
us
in
this
style
nonsense
man
drop
your
suspicions
and
come
along
i
shook
my
head
obstinately
well
said
he
if
i
thought
there
was
anything
in
your
suspicions
i
would
stay
by
you
but
i
confident
they
mean
nothing
but
kindness
so
i
going
off
to
see
the
place
you
be
back
again
said
i
oh
yes
said
he
of
course
i
come
back
and
sleep
here
with
these
words
he
left
and
nearly
all
the
people
accompanied
him
i
was
left
behind
with
the
women
and
children
and
about
a
dozen
men
these
men
busied
themselves
with
some
work
over
the
women
were
occupied
with
some
other
work
over
feathers
no
one
took
any
notice
of
me
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
restraint
upon
me
nor
was
i
watched
in
any
way
once
the
nightmare
hag
came
and
offered
me
a
small
roasted
fowl
about
the
size
of
a
woodcock
i
declined
it
but
at
the
same
time
this
delicate
attention
certainly
surprised
me
i
was
now
beginning
to
struggle
with
some
success
against
my
feelings
of
abhorrence
when
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
something
which
chased
away
every
other
thought
and
made
my
blood
turn
cold
in
my
veins
it
was
something
outside
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
by
the
fire
which
was
still
blazing
bright
and
lighting
up
the
scene
i
saw
four
men
who
had
just
come
to
the
cave
they
were
carrying
something
which
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
a
sick
or
wounded
companion
on
reaching
the
fire
they
put
it
down
and
i
saw
with
a
thrill
of
dismay
that
their
burden
was
neither
sick
nor
wounded
but
dead
for
the
corpse
lay
rigid
as
they
had
placed
it
then
i
saw
the
nightmare
hag
approach
it
with
a
knife
an
awful
thought
came
to
me
the
crowning
horror
the
thought
soon
proved
to
be
but
too
well
founded
the
nightmare
hag
began
to
cut
and
in
an
instant
had
detached
the
arm
of
the
corpse
which
she
thrust
among
the
coals
in
the
very
place
where
lately
she
had
cooked
the
fowl
then
she
went
back
for
more
for
a
moment
my
brain
reeled
and
i
gasped
for
breath
then
i
rose
and
staggered
out
i
know
not
how
no
one
tried
to
stop
me
nor
did
anyone
follow
me
and
for
my
part
i
was
ready
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
the
first
who
dared
to
approach
me
in
this
way
i
reached
the
open
air
and
passed
by
the
hag
and
the
four
men
as
they
were
busy
at
their
awful
work
but
at
this
point
i
was
observed
and
followed
a
number
of
men
and
women
came
after
me
jabbering
their
uncouth
language
and
gesticulating
i
warned
them
off
angrily
they
persisted
and
though
none
of
them
were
armed
yet
i
saw
that
they
were
unwilling
to
have
me
leave
the
cave
and
i
supposed
that
they
would
try
to
prevent
me
by
force
the
absence
of
agnew
made
my
position
a
difficult
one
had
it
not
been
for
this
i
would
have
burst
through
them
and
fled
to
the
boat
but
as
long
as
he
was
away
i
felt
bound
to
wait
and
though
i
longed
to
fly
i
could
not
for
his
sake
the
boat
seemed
to
be
a
haven
of
rest
i
longed
to
be
in
her
once
more
and
drift
away
even
if
it
should
be
to
my
death
nature
was
here
less
terrible
than
man
and
it
seemed
better
to
drown
in
the
waters
to
perish
amid
rocks
and
whirlpools
than
to
linger
here
amid
such
horrors
as
these
these
people
were
not
like
human
beings
the
vilest
and
lowest
savages
that
i
had
ever
seen
were
not
so
odious
as
these
a
herd
of
monkeys
would
be
far
more
congenial
a
flock
of
wolves
less
abhorrent
they
had
the
caricature
of
the
human
form
they
were
the
lowest
of
humanity
their
speech
was
a
mockery
of
language
their
faces
devilish
their
kindness
a
cunning
pretence
and
most
hideous
of
all
was
the
nightmare
hag
that
prepared
the
cannibal
repast
i
could
not
begin
hostilities
for
i
had
to
wait
for
agnew
so
i
stood
and
looked
and
then
walked
away
for
a
little
distance
they
followed
me
closely
with
eager
words
and
gesticulations
though
as
yet
no
one
touched
me
or
threatened
me
their
tone
seemed
rather
one
of
persuasion
after
a
few
paces
i
stood
still
with
all
of
them
around
me
the
horrible
repast
showed
plainly
all
that
was
in
store
for
us
they
received
us
kindly
and
fed
us
well
only
to
devote
us
to
the
most
abhorrent
of
deaths
agnew
in
his
mad
confidence
was
only
insuring
his
own
doom
he
was
putting
himself
completely
in
the
power
of
devils
who
were
incapable
of
pity
and
strangers
to
humanity
to
make
friends
with
such
fiends
was
impossible
and
i
felt
sure
that
our
only
plan
was
to
rule
by
terror
to
seize
to
slay
to
conquer
but
still
i
had
to
wait
for
him
and
did
not
dare
to
resort
to
violence
while
he
was
absent
so
i
waited
while
the
savages
gathered
round
me
contenting
themselves
with
guarding
me
and
neither
touching
me
nor
threatening
me
and
all
this
time
the
hag
went
on
intent
on
her
preparation
of
the
horrible
repast
while
standing
there
looking
listening
waiting
for
agnew
i
noticed
many
things
far
away
the
volcanoes
blazed
and
the
northern
sky
was
red
with
a
lurid
light
there
too
higher
up
the
moon
was
shining
overhead
the
sky
was
gleaming
with
stars
and
all
over
the
heavens
there
shone
the
lustre
of
the
aurora
australis
brighter
than
any
i
had
ever
seen
surpassing
the
moon
and
illuminating
all
it
lighted
up
the
haggard
faces
of
the
devils
around
me
and
it
again
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
had
died
and
gone
to
the
land
of
woe
an
iron
land
a
land
of
despair
with
lurid
fires
all
aglow
and
faces
of
fear
suddenly
there
burst
upon
my
ears
the
report
of
a
gun
which
sounded
like
a
and
echoed
in
long
reverberations
at
once
i
understood
it
my
fears
had
proved
true
these
savages
had
enticed
agnew
away
to
destroy
him
in
an
instant
i
burst
through
the
crowd
around
me
and
ran
wildly
in
the
direction
of
that
sound
calling
his
name
as
i
ran
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
heard
a
loud
cry
then
another
report
i
hurried
on
shouting
his
name
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
the
strange
courage
of
these
savages
had
already
impressed
me
deeply
they
did
not
fear
our
guns
they
were
all
attacking
him
and
he
was
alone
fighting
for
his
life
then
there
was
another
report
it
was
his
pistol
i
still
ran
on
and
still
shouted
to
him
at
last
i
received
an
answer
he
had
perhaps
heard
me
and
was
answering
or
at
any
rate
he
was
warning
me
more
he
cried
fly
fly
fly
to
the
boat
save
yourself
where
are
you
i
cried
as
i
still
rushed
on
fly
more
fly
save
yourself
you
ca
save
me
i
lost
fly
for
your
life
judging
from
his
cries
he
did
not
seem
far
away
i
hurried
on
i
could
see
nothing
of
him
all
the
time
the
savages
followed
me
none
were
armed
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
preparing
to
fling
themselves
upon
me
and
overpower
me
with
their
numbers
they
would
capture
me
alive
i
thought
bind
me
and
carry
me
back
reserving
me
for
a
future
time
i
turned
and
waved
them
back
they
took
no
notice
of
my
gesture
then
i
ran
on
once
more
they
followed
they
could
not
run
so
fast
as
i
did
and
so
i
gained
on
them
rapidly
still
shouting
to
agnew
but
there
was
no
response
i
ran
backward
and
forward
crossing
and
recrossing
doubling
and
turning
pursued
all
the
time
by
the
savages
at
last
in
rage
and
despair
i
fired
upon
them
and
one
of
them
fell
but
to
my
dismay
the
others
did
not
seem
to
care
one
whit
they
did
not
stop
for
one
moment
but
pursued
as
before
my
situation
was
now
plain
in
all
its
truth
they
had
enticed
agnew
away
they
had
attacked
him
he
had
fought
and
had
been
overpowered
he
had
tried
to
give
me
warning
his
last
words
had
been
for
me
to
fly
to
fly
yes
for
he
well
knew
that
it
was
better
far
for
me
to
go
to
death
through
the
raging
torrent
than
to
meet
the
fate
which
had
fallen
upon
himself
for
him
there
was
now
no
more
hope
that
he
was
lost
was
plain
if
he
were
still
alive
he
would
call
to
me
but
his
voice
had
been
silenced
for
some
time
all
was
over
and
that
noble
heart
that
had
withstood
so
bravely
and
cheerily
the
rigors
of
the
storm
and
the
horrors
of
our
desperate
voyage
had
been
stilled
in
death
by
the
vilest
of
miscreants
i
paused
for
a
moment
even
though
agnew
was
dead
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
him
but
felt
as
though
i
ought
to
share
his
fate
the
savages
came
nearer
at
their
approach
i
hesitated
no
longer
that
fate
was
too
terrible
i
must
fly
but
before
i
fled
i
turned
in
fury
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
them
for
their
crimes
full
of
rage
and
despair
i
discharged
my
remaining
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
then
i
fled
toward
the
boat
on
the
way
i
had
a
frightful
thought
that
she
might
have
been
sent
adrift
but
on
approaching
the
place
i
found
her
there
just
as
i
had
left
her
the
savages
with
their
usual
fearlessness
still
pursued
for
a
moment
i
stood
on
the
shore
with
the
grapple
in
my
hand
and
the
boat
close
by
and
as
they
came
near
i
discharged
my
pistol
into
the
midst
of
them
then
i
sprang
into
the
boat
the
swift
current
bore
me
away
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
crowd
of
pursuing
demons
disappeared
from
view
chapter
v
the
torrent
sweeping
under
the
mountains
the
boat
drifted
on
the
light
given
by
the
aurora
and
the
low
moon
seemed
to
grow
fainter
and
as
i
looked
behind
i
saw
that
the
distant
glow
from
the
volcanic
fires
had
become
more
brilliant
in
the
increasing
darkness
the
sides
of
the
channel
grew
steeper
until
at
last
they
became
rocky
precipices
rising
to
an
unknown
height
the
channel
itself
grew
narrower
till
from
a
width
of
two
miles
it
had
contracted
to
a
tenth
of
those
dimensions
but
with
this
lessening
width
the
waters
seemed
to
rush
far
more
swiftly
here
i
drifted
helplessly
and
saw
the
gloomy
rocky
cliffs
sweep
past
me
as
i
was
hurled
onward
on
the
breast
of
the
tremendous
flood
i
was
in
despair
the
fate
of
agnew
had
prepared
me
for
my
own
and
i
was
only
thankful
that
my
fate
since
it
was
inevitable
would
be
less
appalling
death
seemed
certain
and
my
chief
thought
now
was
as
to
the
moment
when
it
would
come
i
was
prepared
i
felt
that
i
could
meet
it
calmly
sternly
even
thankfully
far
better
was
a
death
here
amid
the
roar
of
waters
than
at
the
hands
of
those
abhorrent
beings
by
whose
treachery
my
friend
had
fallen
as
i
went
on
the
precipices
rose
higher
and
seemed
to
overhang
the
channel
grew
narrower
the
light
grew
fainter
until
at
last
all
around
me
grew
dark
i
was
floating
at
the
bottom
of
a
vast
chasm
where
the
sides
seemed
to
rise
precipitously
for
thousands
of
feet
where
neither
watery
flood
nor
rocky
wall
was
visible
and
where
far
above
i
could
see
the
line
of
sky
between
the
summits
of
the
cliffs
and
watch
the
glowing
stars
and
as
i
watched
them
there
came
to
me
the
thought
that
this
was
my
last
sight
on
earth
and
i
could
only
hope
that
the
life
which
was
so
swiftly
approaching
its
end
might
live
again
somewhere
among
those
glittering
orbs
so
i
thought
and
with
these
thoughts
i
drifted
on
i
can
not
tell
how
long
until
at
length
there
appeared
a
vast
black
mass
where
the
open
sky
above
me
terminated
and
where
the
lustre
of
the
stars
and
the
light
of
the
heavens
were
all
swallowed
up
in
utter
darkness
this
then
i
thought
is
the
end
here
amid
this
darkness
i
must
make
the
awful
plunge
and
find
my
death
i
fell
upon
my
knees
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
prayed
as
i
knelt
there
the
boat
drew
nearer
the
black
mass
grew
blacker
the
current
swept
me
on
there
were
no
breakers
there
was
no
phosphorescent
sparkle
of
seething
waters
and
no
whiteness
of
foam
i
thought
that
i
was
on
the
brink
of
some
tremendous
cataract
a
thousand
times
deeper
than
niagara
some
fall
where
the
waters
plunged
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
where
gathering
for
the
terrific
descent
all
other
movements
all
dashings
and
writhings
and
twistings
were
obliterated
and
lost
in
the
one
overwhelming
onward
rush
suddenly
all
grew
dark
dark
beyond
all
expression
the
sky
above
was
in
a
moment
snatched
from
view
i
had
been
flung
into
some
tremendous
cavern
and
there
on
my
knees
with
terror
in
my
heart
i
waited
for
death
the
moments
passed
and
death
delayed
to
come
the
awful
plunge
was
still
put
off
and
though
i
remained
on
my
knees
and
waited
long
still
the
end
came
not
the
waters
seemed
still
the
boat
motionless
it
was
borne
upon
the
surface
of
a
vast
stream
as
smooth
as
glass
but
who
could
tell
how
deep
that
stream
was
or
how
wide
at
length
i
rose
from
my
knees
and
sank
down
upon
the
seat
of
the
boat
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
gloom
in
vain
nothing
was
visible
it
was
the
very
blackness
of
darkness
i
listened
but
heard
nothing
save
a
deep
dull
droning
sound
which
seemed
to
fill
all
the
air
and
make
it
all
tremulous
with
its
vibrations
i
tried
to
collect
my
thoughts
i
recalled
that
old
theory
which
had
been
in
my
mind
before
this
and
which
i
had
mentioned
to
agnew
this
was
the
notion
that
at
each
pole
there
is
a
vast
opening
that
into
one
of
them
all
the
waters
of
the
ocean
pour
themselves
and
after
passing
through
the
earth
come
out
at
the
other
pole
to
pass
about
its
surface
in
innumerable
streams
it
was
a
wild
fancy
which
i
had
laughed
at
under
other
circumstances
but
which
now
occurred
to
me
once
more
when
i
was
overwhelmed
with
despair
and
my
mind
was
weakened
by
the
horrors
which
i
had
experienced
and
i
had
a
vague
fear
that
i
had
been
drawn
into
the
very
channel
through
which
the
ocean
waters
flowed
in
their
course
to
that
terrific
that
unparalleled
abyss
still
there
was
as
yet
no
sign
whatever
of
anything
like
a
descent
for
the
boat
was
on
even
keel
and
perfectly
level
as
before
and
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
whether
i
was
moving
swiftly
or
slowly
or
standing
perfectly
still
for
in
that
darkness
there
were
no
visible
objects
by
which
i
could
find
out
the
rate
of
my
progress
and
as
those
who
go
up
in
balloons
are
utterly
insensible
of
motion
so
was
i
on
those
calm
but
swift
waters
at
length
there
came
into
view
something
which
arrested
my
attention
and
engrossed
all
my
thoughts
it
was
faint
glow
that
at
first
caught
my
gaze
and
on
turning
to
see
it
better
i
saw
a
round
red
spot
glowing
like
fire
i
had
not
seen
this
before
it
looked
like
the
moon
when
it
rises
from
behind
clouds
and
glows
red
and
lurid
from
the
horizon
and
so
this
glowed
but
not
with
the
steady
light
of
the
moon
for
the
light
was
fitful
and
sometimes
flashed
into
a
baleful
brightness
which
soon
subsided
into
a
dimmer
lustre
new
alarm
arose
within
me
for
this
new
sight
suggested
something
more
terrible
than
anything
that
i
had
thus
far
thought
of
this
then
i
thought
was
to
be
the
end
of
my
voyage
this
was
my
goal
a
pit
of
fire
into
which
i
should
be
hurled
would
it
be
well
i
thought
to
wait
for
such
a
fate
and
experience
such
a
would
it
not
be
better
for
me
to
take
my
own
life
before
i
should
know
the
worst
i
took
my
pistol
and
loaded
it
so
as
to
be
prepared
but
hesitated
to
use
it
until
my
fate
should
be
more
apparent
so
i
sat
holding
my
pistol
prepared
to
use
it
watching
the
light
and
awaiting
the
time
when
the
glowing
fires
should
make
all
further
hope
impossible
but
time
passed
and
the
light
grew
no
brighter
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
grow
fainter
there
was
also
another
change
instead
of
shining
before
me
it
appeared
more
on
my
left
from
this
it
went
on
changing
its
position
until
at
length
it
was
astern
all
the
time
it
continued
to
grow
fainter
and
it
seemed
certain
that
i
was
moving
away
from
it
rather
than
toward
it
in
the
midst
of
this
there
occurred
a
new
thought
which
seemed
to
account
for
this
light
this
was
that
it
arose
from
these
same
volcanoes
which
had
illuminated
the
northern
sky
when
i
was
ashore
and
followed
me
still
with
their
glare
i
had
been
carried
into
this
darkness
through
some
vast
opening
which
now
lay
behind
me
disclosing
the
red
volcano
glow
and
this
it
was
that
caused
that
roundness
and
resemblance
to
the
moon
i
saw
that
i
was
still
moving
on
away
from
that
light
as
before
and
that
its
changing
position
was
due
to
the
turning
of
the
boat
as
the
water
drifted
it
along
now
stern
foremost
now
sidewise
and
again
bow
foremost
from
this
it
seemed
plainly
evident
that
the
waters
had
borne
me
into
some
vast
cavern
of
unknown
extent
which
went
under
the
mountains
a
subterranean
channel
whose
issue
i
could
not
conjecture
was
this
the
beginning
of
that
course
which
should
ultimately
become
a
plunge
deep
down
into
some
unutterable
abyss
or
might
i
ever
hope
to
emerge
again
into
the
light
of
day
perhaps
in
some
other
ocean
some
land
of
ice
and
frost
and
eternal
night
but
the
old
theory
of
the
flow
of
water
through
the
earth
had
taken
hold
of
me
and
could
not
be
shaken
off
i
knew
some
scientific
men
held
the
opinion
that
the
earth
interior
is
a
mass
of
molten
rock
and
fire
and
that
the
earth
itself
had
once
been
a
burning
orb
which
had
cooled
down
at
the
surface
yet
after
all
this
was
only
a
theory
and
there
were
other
theories
which
were
totally
different
as
a
boy
i
had
read
wild
works
of
fiction
about
lands
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
with
a
sun
at
the
centre
which
gave
them
the
light
of
a
perpetual
day
these
i
knew
were
only
the
creations
of
fiction
yet
after
all
it
seemed
possible
that
the
earth
might
contain
vast
hollow
spaces
in
its
interior
realms
of
eternal
darkness
caverns
in
comparison
with
which
the
hugest
caves
on
the
surface
were
but
the
tiniest
cells
i
was
now
being
borne
on
to
these
in
that
case
there
might
be
no
sudden
plunge
after
all
the
stream
might
run
on
for
many
thousand
miles
through
this
terrific
cavern
gloom
in
accordance
with
natural
laws
and
i
might
thus
live
and
drift
on
in
this
darkness
until
i
should
die
a
lingering
death
of
horror
and
despair
there
was
no
possible
way
of
forming
any
estimate
as
to
speed
all
was
dark
and
even
the
glow
behind
was
fading
away
nor
could
i
make
any
conjecture
whatever
as
to
the
size
of
the
channel
at
the
opening
it
had
been
contracted
and
narrow
but
here
it
might
have
expanded
itself
to
miles
and
its
vaulted
top
might
reach
almost
to
the
summit
of
the
lofty
mountains
while
sight
thus
failed
me
sound
was
equally
unavailing
for
it
was
always
the
same
a
sustained
and
unintermittent
roar
a
low
droning
sound
deep
and
terrible
with
no
variations
of
dashing
breakers
or
rushing
rapids
or
falling
cataracts
vague
thoughts
of
final
escape
came
and
went
but
in
such
a
situation
hope
could
not
be
sustained
the
thick
darkness
oppressed
the
soul
and
at
length
even
the
glow
of
the
distant
volcanoes
which
had
been
gradually
diminishing
grew
dimmer
and
fainter
and
finally
faded
out
altogether
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
my
last
sight
of
earthly
things
after
this
nothing
was
left
there
was
no
longer
for
me
such
a
thing
as
sight
there
was
nothing
but
darkness
perpetual
and
eternal
night
i
was
buried
in
a
cavern
of
rushing
waters
to
which
there
would
be
no
end
where
i
should
be
borne
onward
helplessly
by
the
resistless
tide
to
a
mysterious
and
an
appalling
doom
the
darkness
grew
so
intolerable
that
i
longed
for
something
to
dispel
it
if
only
for
a
moment
i
struck
a
match
the
air
was
still
and
the
flame
flashed
out
lighting
up
the
boat
and
showing
the
black
water
around
me
this
made
me
eager
to
see
more
i
loaded
both
barrels
of
the
rifle
keeping
my
pistol
for
another
purpose
and
then
fired
one
of
them
there
was
a
tremendous
report
that
rang
in
my
ears
like
a
hundred
and
rolled
and
reverberated
far
along
and
died
away
in
endless
echoes
the
flash
lighted
up
the
scene
for
an
instant
and
for
an
instant
only
like
the
sudden
lightning
it
revealed
all
around
i
saw
a
wide
expanse
of
water
black
as
ink
a
stygian
pool
but
no
rocks
were
visible
and
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
been
carried
into
a
subterranean
sea
i
loaded
the
empty
barrel
and
waited
the
flash
of
light
had
revealed
nothing
yet
it
had
distracted
my
thoughts
and
the
work
of
reloading
was
an
additional
distraction
anything
was
better
than
inaction
i
did
not
wish
to
waste
my
ammunition
yet
i
thought
that
an
occasional
shot
might
serve
some
good
purpose
if
it
was
only
to
afford
me
some
relief
from
despair
and
now
as
i
sat
with
the
rifle
in
my
hands
i
was
aware
of
a
sound
new
exciting
different
altogether
from
the
murmur
of
innumerable
waters
that
filled
my
ears
and
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
droning
echoes
of
the
rushing
flood
it
was
a
sound
that
spoke
of
life
i
heard
quick
heavy
pantings
as
of
some
great
living
thing
and
with
this
there
came
the
noise
of
regular
movements
in
the
water
and
the
foaming
and
gurgling
of
waves
it
was
as
though
some
living
breathing
creature
were
here
not
far
away
moving
through
these
midnight
waters
and
with
this
discovery
there
came
a
new
fear
the
fear
of
pursuit
i
thought
that
some
had
scented
me
in
my
boat
and
had
started
to
attack
me
this
new
fear
aroused
me
to
action
it
was
a
danger
quite
unlike
any
other
which
i
had
ever
known
yet
the
fear
which
it
inspired
was
a
feeling
that
roused
me
to
action
and
prompted
me
even
though
the
coming
danger
might
be
as
sure
as
death
to
rise
against
it
and
resist
to
the
last
so
i
stood
up
with
my
rifle
and
listened
with
all
my
soul
in
my
sense
of
hearing
the
sounds
arose
more
plainly
they
had
come
nearer
they
were
immediately
in
front
i
raised
my
rifle
and
took
aim
then
in
quick
succession
two
reports
thundered
out
with
tremendous
uproar
and
interminable
echoes
but
the
long
reverberations
were
unheeded
in
the
blaze
of
sudden
light
and
the
vision
that
was
revealed
for
there
full
before
me
i
saw
though
but
for
an
instant
a
tremendous
sight
it
was
a
vast
monster
moving
in
the
waters
against
the
stream
and
toward
the
boat
its
head
was
raised
high
its
eyes
were
inflamed
with
a
baleful
light
its
jaws
opened
wide
bristled
with
sharp
teeth
and
it
had
a
long
neck
joined
to
a
body
of
enormous
bulk
with
a
tail
that
lashed
all
the
water
into
foam
it
was
but
for
an
instant
that
i
saw
it
and
then
with
a
sudden
plunge
the
monster
dived
while
at
the
same
moment
all
was
as
dark
as
before
full
of
terror
and
excitement
i
loaded
my
rifle
again
and
waited
listening
for
a
renewal
of
the
noise
i
felt
sure
that
the
monster
balked
of
his
prey
would
return
with
redoubled
fury
and
that
i
should
have
to
renew
the
conflict
i
felt
that
the
dangers
of
the
subterranean
passage
and
of
the
rushing
waters
had
passed
away
and
that
a
new
peril
had
arisen
from
the
assault
of
this
monster
of
the
deep
nor
was
it
this
one
alone
that
was
to
be
dreaded
where
one
was
others
were
sure
to
be
and
if
this
one
should
pass
me
by
it
would
only
leave
me
to
be
assailed
by
monsters
of
the
same
kind
and
these
would
probably
increase
in
number
as
i
advanced
farther
into
this
realm
of
darkness
and
yet
in
spite
of
these
grisly
thoughts
i
felt
less
of
horror
than
before
for
the
fear
which
i
had
was
now
associated
with
action
and
as
i
stood
waiting
for
the
onset
and
listening
for
the
approach
of
the
enemy
the
excitement
that
ensued
was
a
positive
relief
from
the
dull
despair
into
which
i
had
sunk
but
a
moment
before
yet
though
i
waited
for
a
new
attack
i
waited
in
vain
the
monster
did
not
come
back
either
the
flash
and
the
noise
had
terrified
him
or
the
bullets
had
hit
him
or
else
in
his
vastness
he
had
been
indifferent
to
so
feeble
a
creature
as
myself
but
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
he
did
not
emerge
again
out
of
the
darkness
and
silence
into
which
he
had
sunk
for
a
long
time
i
stood
waiting
then
i
sat
down
still
watchful
still
listening
but
without
any
result
until
at
length
i
began
to
think
that
there
was
no
chance
of
any
new
attack
indeed
it
seemed
now
as
though
there
had
been
no
attack
at
all
but
that
the
monster
had
been
swimming
at
random
without
any
thought
of
me
in
which
case
my
had
terrified
him
more
than
his
fearful
form
had
terrified
me
on
the
whole
this
incident
had
greatly
benefited
me
it
had
roused
me
from
my
despair
i
grew
reckless
and
felt
a
disposition
to
acquiesce
in
whatever
fate
might
have
in
store
for
me
and
now
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
exhausted
from
long
watchfulness
and
anxiety
i
sank
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
chapter
vi
the
new
world
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
my
sleep
was
profound
yet
disturbed
by
troubled
dreams
in
which
i
lived
over
again
all
the
eventful
scenes
of
the
past
and
these
were
all
intermingled
in
the
wildest
confusion
the
cannibals
beckoned
to
us
from
the
peak
and
we
landed
between
the
two
volcanoes
there
the
body
of
the
dead
sailor
received
us
and
afterward
chased
us
to
the
boat
then
came
snow
and
volcanic
eruptions
and
we
drifted
amid
icebergs
and
molten
lava
until
we
entered
an
iron
portal
and
plunged
into
darkness
here
there
were
vast
swimming
monsters
and
burning
orbs
of
fire
and
thunderous
cataracts
falling
from
inconceivable
heights
and
the
sweep
of
immeasurable
tides
and
the
circling
of
infinite
whirlpools
while
in
my
ears
there
rang
the
roar
of
remorseless
waters
that
came
after
us
with
all
their
waves
and
billows
rolling
upon
us
it
was
a
dream
in
which
all
the
material
terrors
of
the
past
were
renewed
but
these
were
all
as
nothing
when
compared
with
a
certain
deep
underlying
feeling
that
possessed
my
soul
a
sense
of
loss
irretrievable
an
expectation
of
impending
doom
a
drear
and
immitigable
despair
in
the
midst
of
this
i
awoke
it
was
with
a
sudden
start
and
i
looked
all
around
in
speechless
bewilderment
the
first
thing
of
which
i
was
conscious
was
a
great
blaze
of
light
light
so
lately
lost
and
supposed
to
be
lost
forever
but
now
filling
all
the
universe
bright
brilliant
glowing
bringing
hope
and
joy
and
gladness
with
all
the
splendor
of
deep
blue
skies
and
the
multitudinous
laughter
of
ocean
waves
that
danced
and
sparkled
in
the
sun
i
flung
up
my
arms
and
laughed
aloud
then
i
burst
into
tears
and
falling
on
my
knees
i
thanked
the
almighty
ruler
of
the
skies
for
this
marvellous
deliverance
rising
from
my
knees
i
looked
around
and
once
more
amazement
overwhelmed
me
i
saw
a
long
line
of
mountains
towering
up
to
immeasurable
heights
their
summits
covered
with
eternal
ice
and
snow
there
the
sun
blazed
low
in
the
sky
elevated
but
a
few
degrees
above
the
mountain
crests
which
gleamed
in
gold
and
purple
under
its
fiery
rays
the
sun
seemed
enlarged
to
unusual
dimensions
and
the
mountains
ran
away
on
every
side
like
the
segment
of
some
infinite
circle
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
lay
a
land
all
green
with
vegetation
where
cultivated
fields
were
visible
and
vineyards
and
orchards
and
groves
together
with
forests
of
palm
and
all
manner
of
trees
of
every
variety
of
hue
which
ran
up
the
sides
of
the
mountains
till
they
reached
the
limits
of
vegetation
and
the
regions
of
snow
and
ice
here
in
all
directions
there
were
unmistakable
signs
of
human
life
the
outlines
of
populous
cities
and
busy
towns
and
hamlets
roads
winding
far
away
along
the
plain
or
up
the
and
mighty
works
of
industry
in
the
shape
of
massive
structures
terraced
slopes
long
rows
of
arches
ponderous
pyramids
and
battlemented
walls
from
the
land
i
turned
to
the
sea
i
saw
before
me
an
expanse
of
water
intensely
blue
an
extent
so
vast
that
never
before
in
all
my
ocean
voyages
had
anything
appeared
at
all
comparable
with
it
out
at
sea
wherever
i
had
been
the
water
had
always
limited
the
view
the
horizon
had
never
seemed
far
away
ships
soon
sank
below
it
and
the
visible
surface
of
the
earth
was
thus
always
contracted
but
here
to
my
bewilderment
the
horizon
appeared
to
be
removed
to
an
immeasurable
distance
and
raised
high
in
the
air
while
the
waters
were
prolonged
endlessly
starting
from
where
i
was
they
went
away
to
inconceivable
distances
and
the
view
before
me
seemed
like
a
watery
declivity
reaching
for
a
thousand
miles
till
it
approached
the
horizon
far
up
in
the
sky
nor
was
it
any
delusion
of
the
senses
that
caused
this
unparalleled
spectacle
i
was
familiar
with
the
phenomena
of
the
mirage
and
knew
well
that
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind
here
for
the
mirage
always
shows
great
surfaces
of
stillness
or
a
regular
vibration
glassy
tides
and
indistinct
distances
but
here
everything
was
sharply
defined
in
the
clear
atmosphere
the
sky
overhung
a
deep
blue
vault
the
waves
danced
and
sparkled
in
the
sun
the
waters
rolled
and
foamed
on
every
side
and
the
fresh
breeze
as
it
blew
over
the
ocean
brought
with
it
such
exhilarating
influences
that
it
acted
upon
me
like
some
reviving
cordial
from
the
works
of
nature
i
turned
to
those
of
man
these
were
visible
everywhere
on
the
land
in
cities
and
cultivated
fields
and
mighty
constructions
on
the
sea
in
floating
craft
which
appeared
wherever
i
turned
my
eyes
boats
like
those
of
fishermen
ships
long
and
low
some
like
galleys
propelled
by
a
hundred
oars
others
provided
with
one
huge
which
enabled
them
to
run
before
the
wind
they
were
unlike
any
ships
which
i
had
ever
seen
for
neither
in
the
mediterranean
nor
in
chinese
waters
were
there
any
craft
like
these
and
they
reminded
me
rather
of
those
ancient
galleys
which
i
had
seen
in
pictures
i
was
lost
in
wonder
as
to
where
i
was
and
what
land
this
could
be
to
which
i
had
been
brought
i
had
not
plunged
into
the
interior
of
the
earth
but
i
had
been
carried
under
the
mountains
and
had
emerged
again
into
the
glad
light
of
the
sun
could
it
be
possible
i
thought
that
agnew
hope
had
been
realized
and
that
i
had
been
carried
into
the
warm
regions
of
the
south
pacific
ocean
yet
in
the
south
pacific
there
could
be
no
place
like
this
no
immeasurable
expanse
of
waters
no
horizon
raised
mountain
high
it
seemed
like
a
vast
world
for
all
around
me
the
surface
appeared
to
rise
and
i
was
in
what
looked
like
a
depression
yet
i
knew
that
the
basin
and
the
depression
were
an
illusion
and
that
this
appearance
was
due
to
the
immense
extent
of
level
surface
with
the
environment
of
lofty
mountains
i
had
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
i
had
been
borne
onward
for
an
immense
distance
over
all
the
known
surface
of
the
earth
no
one
had
ever
seen
anything
like
this
there
were
but
two
places
where
such
an
immeasurable
plain
was
possible
and
those
were
at
the
flattened
poles
where
i
was
i
now
knew
well
i
had
reached
the
antarctic
pole
here
the
earth
was
flat
an
immense
level
with
no
roundness
to
lessen
the
reach
of
the
horizon
but
an
almost
even
surface
that
gave
an
unimpeded
view
for
hundreds
of
miles
the
subterranean
channel
had
rushed
through
the
mountains
and
had
carried
me
here
here
came
all
the
waters
of
the
northern
ocean
pouring
into
this
vast
polar
sea
perhaps
to
issue
forth
from
it
by
some
similar
passage
here
then
was
the
south
pole
a
world
by
itself
and
how
different
from
that
terrible
that
iron
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
not
a
world
of
ice
and
frost
but
one
of
beauty
and
light
with
a
climate
that
was
almost
tropical
in
its
warmth
and
lands
that
were
covered
with
the
rank
luxuriance
of
a
teeming
vegetable
life
i
had
passed
from
that
outer
world
to
this
inner
one
and
the
passage
was
from
death
unto
life
from
agony
and
despair
to
sunlight
and
splendor
and
joy
above
all
in
all
around
me
that
which
most
impressed
me
now
was
the
rich
and
superabundant
life
and
a
warmth
of
air
which
made
me
think
of
india
it
was
an
amazing
and
an
unaccountable
thing
and
i
could
only
attribute
it
to
the
flattening
of
the
poles
which
brought
the
surface
nearer
to
the
supposed
central
fires
of
the
earth
and
therefore
created
a
heat
as
great
as
that
of
the
equatorial
regions
here
i
found
a
tropical
climate
a
land
warmed
not
by
the
sun
but
from
the
earth
itself
or
another
cause
might
be
found
in
the
warm
ocean
currents
whatever
the
true
one
might
be
i
was
utterly
unable
to
form
a
conjecture
but
i
had
no
time
for
such
speculations
as
these
after
the
first
emotions
of
wonder
and
admiration
had
somewhat
subsided
i
began
to
experience
other
sensations
i
began
to
remember
that
i
had
eaten
nothing
for
a
length
of
time
that
i
had
no
means
of
calculating
and
to
look
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
way
of
satisfying
my
hunger
the
question
arose
now
what
was
to
be
done
after
my
recent
terrible
experience
i
naturally
shrank
from
again
committing
myself
to
the
tender
mercies
of
strange
tribes
yet
further
thought
and
examination
showed
me
that
the
people
of
this
strange
land
must
be
very
different
from
those
frightful
savages
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
everywhere
i
beheld
the
manifest
signs
of
cultivation
and
civilization
still
i
knew
that
even
civilized
people
would
not
necessarily
be
any
kinder
than
savages
and
that
i
might
be
seized
and
flung
into
hopeless
imprisonment
or
slavery
so
i
hesitated
yet
what
could
i
do
my
hunger
was
beginning
to
be
insupportable
i
had
reached
a
place
where
i
had
to
choose
between
starvation
on
the
one
hand
or
a
venture
among
these
people
on
the
other
to
go
back
was
impossible
who
could
breast
those
waters
in
the
tremendous
subterranean
channel
or
force
his
way
back
through
such
appalling
dangers
or
if
that
were
possible
who
could
ever
hope
to
breast
those
mighty
currents
beyond
or
work
his
way
amid
everlasting
ice
and
immeasurable
seas
no
return
was
impossible
i
had
been
flung
into
this
world
of
wonders
and
here
would
be
my
home
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
though
i
could
not
now
imagine
whether
those
days
would
be
passed
in
peace
or
in
bitter
slavery
and
sorrow
yet
the
decision
must
be
made
and
the
risk
must
be
run
it
must
be
so
i
must
land
here
venture
among
these
people
and
trust
in
that
providence
which
had
hitherto
sustained
me
having
thus
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
try
my
fate
i
rowed
in
toward
the
shore
thus
far
i
had
seen
galleys
passing
and
small
boats
but
they
had
taken
no
notice
of
me
for
the
reason
that
they
were
too
far
away
to
perceive
anything
about
me
that
differed
from
any
other
boat
but
now
as
i
rowed
i
noticed
a
galley
coming
down
toward
me
she
seemed
to
be
going
in
toward
the
shore
at
the
very
point
at
which
i
was
aiming
and
her
course
and
mine
must
soon
meet
if
i
continued
to
row
after
some
hesitation
i
concluded
to
make
signals
to
her
so
as
to
attract
attention
for
now
that
i
had
resolved
to
venture
among
the
people
here
i
was
anxious
to
end
my
suspense
as
soon
as
possible
so
i
continued
rowing
and
gradually
drew
nearer
the
galley
was
propelled
by
oars
of
which
there
were
fifty
on
either
side
the
stem
was
raised
and
covered
in
like
a
cabin
at
length
i
ceased
rowing
and
sat
watching
her
i
soon
saw
that
i
was
noticed
but
this
did
not
occur
till
the
galley
was
close
by
me
so
close
indeed
that
i
thought
they
would
pass
without
perceiving
me
i
raised
my
hands
waved
them
and
gave
a
cry
the
galley
at
once
stopped
a
boat
was
lowered
and
some
men
descended
and
rowed
toward
me
they
were
men
of
strange
appearance
very
small
in
stature
and
slender
in
frame
their
hair
was
black
and
straight
their
features
were
quite
regular
and
their
general
expression
was
one
of
great
gentleness
i
was
surprised
to
notice
that
they
kept
their
eyes
almost
closed
as
though
they
were
weak
and
troubled
by
the
glare
of
the
sun
with
their
eyes
they
blinked
at
me
and
then
one
who
appeared
to
be
their
chief
spoke
to
me
i
understood
not
a
word
and
then
i
answered
him
in
english
which
of
course
was
equally
unintelligible
to
him
i
then
made
signs
pointing
to
the
mountains
and
endeavoring
to
make
known
to
him
that
i
had
come
from
beyond
them
that
i
had
suffered
shipwreck
that
i
had
drifted
here
and
that
i
needed
assistance
of
all
this
it
was
quite
evident
that
they
understood
nothing
except
the
fact
that
i
needed
help
the
moment
that
they
comprehended
this
they
took
me
in
tow
and
rowed
back
to
the
galley
i
found
the
galley
to
be
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
for
about
two
thirds
of
this
length
forward
it
was
open
and
filled
with
seats
where
there
were
about
a
hundred
rowers
who
all
looked
like
those
that
i
had
first
seen
all
being
of
small
stature
slender
frames
and
moreover
all
being
apparently
distressed
by
the
sunlight
there
was
in
all
of
them
the
same
mild
and
gentle
expression
in
complexion
and
general
outline
of
features
they
were
not
unlike
arabs
but
they
were
entirely
destitute
of
that
hardness
and
austerity
which
the
latter
have
they
all
had
beards
which
were
dressed
in
a
peculiar
way
in
plaits
their
costume
varied
the
rowers
wore
a
coarse
tunic
with
a
girdle
of
rope
the
officers
wore
tunics
of
fine
cloth
and
very
elegant
mantles
richly
embroidered
and
with
borders
of
down
they
all
wore
hats
and
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
chief
had
on
his
some
golden
ornaments
here
once
more
i
tried
to
explain
to
them
who
i
was
they
looked
at
me
examining
me
all
over
inspecting
my
gun
pistol
coat
trousers
boots
and
hat
and
talking
all
the
time
among
themselves
they
did
not
touch
me
but
merely
showed
the
natural
curiosity
which
is
felt
at
the
sight
of
a
foreigner
who
has
appeared
unexpectedly
there
was
a
scrupulous
delicacy
and
a
careful
and
even
ceremonious
politeness
in
their
attitude
toward
me
which
was
at
once
amazing
and
delightful
all
fear
and
anxiety
had
now
left
me
in
the
gentle
manners
and
amiable
faces
of
these
people
i
saw
enough
to
assure
me
of
kind
treatment
and
in
my
deep
joy
and
gratitude
for
this
even
my
hunger
was
for
a
time
forgotten
at
length
the
chief
motioned
to
me
to
follow
him
he
led
the
way
to
the
cabin
where
opening
the
door
he
entered
and
i
followed
after
which
the
others
came
in
also
and
then
the
door
was
shut
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
there
were
no
windows
whatever
and
only
one
or
two
slight
crevices
through
which
the
light
came
after
a
time
my
eyes
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
i
could
see
that
the
cabin
was
a
spacious
compartment
adorned
with
rich
hangings
of
some
unknown
material
there
was
a
large
table
and
seats
taking
me
by
the
hand
the
chief
led
me
to
this
where
i
seated
myself
while
the
others
remained
standing
then
some
of
them
went
away
and
soon
returned
with
food
and
drink
the
food
was
of
different
kinds
some
tasting
like
goose
others
like
turkey
others
like
partridge
it
was
all
the
flesh
of
fowls
though
judging
from
the
slices
before
me
they
must
have
been
of
great
size
i
wondered
much
at
the
behavior
of
the
officers
of
the
ship
who
all
and
the
chief
himself
more
than
all
stood
and
waited
upon
me
but
it
was
a
new
world
and
i
supposed
that
this
must
be
the
fashion
so
i
made
no
objections
but
accepted
the
situation
and
ate
with
a
thankful
heart
as
the
first
keenness
of
my
appetite
was
satisfied
i
had
more
leisure
to
make
observations
i
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
my
new
friends
no
longer
blinked
they
were
wide
open
and
so
far
as
i
could
make
them
out
their
faces
were
much
improved
weakness
of
eyes
seemed
common
among
these
people
and
therefore
the
officers
had
their
cabin
darkened
while
the
unfortunate
rowers
had
to
labor
in
the
blazing
sun
such
was
my
conclusion
and
the
fact
reminded
me
of
the
miserable
fellahin
of
egypt
who
have
ophthalmia
from
the
blazing
sun
and
burning
sand
after
the
repast
they
brought
me
water
in
a
basin
and
all
stood
around
me
one
held
the
basin
another
a
towel
another
a
flask
another
took
a
sponge
and
proceeded
to
wash
my
face
and
hands
this
was
all
strange
to
me
yet
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
submission
then
the
chief
who
had
stood
looking
on
with
a
smile
on
his
face
took
off
his
rich
furred
mantle
and
handed
it
to
me
i
was
half
inclined
to
refuse
it
but
was
afraid
of
giving
offence
so
i
accepted
it
and
he
himself
fastened
it
around
my
shoulders
the
others
seemed
actually
to
envy
the
chief
as
though
he
had
gained
some
uncommon
then
they
offered
me
various
drinks
of
which
i
tasted
several
kinds
some
were
sweet
waters
of
different
flavors
others
tasted
like
mild
wine
one
was
a
fermented
drink
light
sweet
and
very
agreeable
to
the
palate
i
now
wished
to
show
my
generous
entertainers
that
i
was
grateful
so
i
raised
my
cup
bowed
to
all
of
them
particularly
the
chief
and
drank
their
health
they
all
watched
this
ceremony
with
very
sober
faces
and
i
could
not
quite
make
out
whether
they
took
my
meaning
or
not
they
certainly
did
not
look
pleased
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
they
felt
hurt
at
any
expression
of
gratitude
so
i
concluded
for
the
future
to
abstain
from
all
such
demonstrations
yet
with
every
moment
the
manners
of
these
people
grew
more
bewildering
it
was
strange
indeed
for
me
to
find
myself
so
suddenly
the
centre
of
interest
and
of
generous
intentions
for
a
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
they
regarded
me
as
some
wonderful
being
with
superior
powers
and
were
trying
to
propitiate
me
by
these
services
yet
i
soon
saw
that
these
services
were
not
at
all
acts
of
propitiation
they
looked
rather
like
those
loving
and
profuse
attentions
which
a
family
showers
down
upon
some
dear
one
long
absent
and
at
last
returned
and
with
this
my
wonder
grew
greater
than
ever
the
galley
had
long
since
resumed
her
progress
i
heard
the
steady
beat
of
the
oars
as
they
all
moved
in
time
and
at
length
the
motion
ceased
the
chief
then
signed
to
me
and
went
out
i
followed
and
the
rest
came
after
and
now
as
i
emerged
from
the
gloom
of
the
cabin
i
found
myself
once
more
in
the
glorious
light
of
day
and
saw
that
we
had
reached
the
land
the
galley
was
hauled
up
alongside
a
stone
quay
and
on
the
shore
there
were
buildings
and
walls
and
trees
and
people
the
chief
went
ashore
at
once
and
i
accompanied
him
we
walked
for
some
distance
along
a
road
with
stone
walls
on
either
side
from
behind
which
there
arose
trees
that
from
a
distance
had
looked
like
palms
i
now
found
them
to
be
giant
ferns
arching
overhead
with
their
broad
fanlike
leaves
and
branches
in
dense
masses
making
the
roadway
quite
dark
in
the
shadow
astonished
as
i
was
at
the
sight
of
these
trees
i
soon
forgot
them
in
a
still
more
astonishing
sight
for
after
going
onward
about
a
hundred
paces
i
stopped
and
found
myself
in
a
wide
space
where
four
met
here
there
were
three
birds
of
gigantic
stature
they
had
vast
bodies
short
legs
short
necks
and
seemed
as
large
as
an
ox
their
wings
were
short
and
evidently
could
not
be
used
for
flight
their
beaks
were
like
that
of
a
each
one
had
a
man
on
his
back
and
was
harnessed
to
a
car
the
chief
motioned
to
me
to
enter
one
of
these
cars
i
did
so
he
followed
and
thereupon
the
driver
started
the
bird
which
set
forth
with
long
rapid
strides
at
a
pace
fast
as
that
of
a
trotting
horse
so
astonished
was
i
that
for
some
time
i
did
not
notice
anything
else
but
at
length
when
my
first
feeling
had
subsided
i
began
to
regard
other
objects
all
the
way
the
dense
fern
foliage
arched
overhead
throwing
down
deep
shadows
they
grew
on
either
side
in
dense
rows
but
between
their
stalks
i
could
see
the
country
beyond
which
lay
all
bright
in
the
sunlight
here
were
broad
fields
all
green
with
verdure
farther
away
arose
clumps
of
at
every
step
of
the
way
new
vistas
opened
amid
the
verdure
and
the
foliage
were
the
roofs
of
structures
that
looked
like
pavilions
and
more
massive
edifices
with
pyramidal
roofs
our
road
constantly
ascended
and
at
length
we
came
to
a
crossing
this
was
a
wide
terrace
at
the
slope
of
the
mountain
on
the
lower
side
was
a
row
of
massive
stone
edifices
with
pyramidal
roofs
while
on
the
upper
there
were
portals
which
seemed
to
open
into
excavated
caverns
here
too
on
either
side
arose
the
giant
ferns
overarching
and
darkening
the
terrace
with
their
deep
shadow
from
this
point
i
looked
back
and
through
the
trunks
of
the
i
could
see
fields
and
pavilions
and
the
pyramidal
roofs
of
massive
edifices
and
broad
verdant
slopes
while
in
the
distance
there
were
peeps
of
the
boundless
sea
we
continued
on
our
way
without
stopping
and
passed
several
successive
terraces
like
the
first
with
the
same
caverns
on
the
upper
side
and
massive
edifices
on
the
lower
until
at
last
the
ascent
ended
at
the
fifth
terrace
and
here
we
turned
to
the
left
now
the
view
became
more
varied
the
arose
on
either
side
arching
overhead
on
my
right
were
the
portals
that
opened
into
caverns
on
my
left
solid
and
massive
houses
built
of
great
blocks
of
stone
with
pyramidal
roofs
as
far
as
i
could
judge
i
was
in
a
city
built
on
the
slope
of
a
mountain
with
its
streets
formed
thus
of
successive
terraces
and
their
connecting
one
half
its
habitations
consisting
of
caverns
while
the
other
half
were
pavilions
and
massive
stone
structures
few
people
however
were
to
be
seen
occasionally
i
saw
one
or
two
groping
along
with
their
eyes
half
shut
seeking
the
darkest
shadows
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
extraordinary
race
of
men
had
some
natural
and
universal
peculiarity
of
eyesight
which
made
them
shun
the
sunlight
and
seek
the
darkness
of
caves
and
of
dense
overshadowing
foliage
at
length
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
terrace
ran
back
till
it
formed
a
semicircle
against
the
mountain
slope
when
several
vast
portals
appeared
here
there
was
a
large
space
where
the
grew
in
long
lines
crossing
each
other
and
making
a
denser
shade
than
usual
on
the
lower
side
were
several
stone
edifices
of
immense
size
and
in
the
middle
of
the
place
there
arose
a
singular
structure
shaped
like
a
half
pyramid
with
three
sides
sloping
and
the
fourth
perpendicular
flat
on
the
top
which
was
approached
by
a
flight
of
steps
we
now
went
on
until
we
reached
the
central
portal
of
the
range
of
caverns
and
here
we
stopped
the
chief
got
out
and
beckoned
to
me
i
followed
he
then
led
the
way
into
the
cavern
while
i
full
of
wonder
walked
behind
him
chapter
vii
scientific
theories
and
scepticism
thus
far
melick
had
been
reading
the
manuscript
but
at
this
point
he
was
interrupted
by
the
announcement
that
dinner
was
ready
upon
this
he
stopped
abruptly
for
on
board
the
falcon
dinner
was
the
great
event
of
the
day
and
in
its
presence
even
the
manuscript
had
to
be
laid
aside
before
long
they
were
all
seated
around
the
in
the
sumptuous
cabin
prepared
to
discuss
the
repast
which
had
been
served
up
by
the
genius
of
the
french
chef
whom
lord
featherstone
had
brought
with
him
let
us
pause
here
for
a
moment
to
take
a
minuter
survey
of
these
four
friends
in
the
first
place
there
was
lord
featherstone
himself
young
handsome
languid
to
a
fault
with
plenty
of
muscle
if
he
chose
to
exert
it
and
plenty
of
brain
if
he
chose
to
make
use
of
it
a
man
who
had
become
weary
of
the
monotony
of
high
life
and
like
many
of
his
order
was
fond
of
seeking
relief
from
the
ennui
of
prosperity
amid
the
excitements
of
the
sea
next
to
him
was
congreve
a
man
with
hair
short
beard
and
mustache
short
nose
gray
eyes
with
spectacles
and
stoutish
body
next
came
noel
oxenden
late
of
trinity
college
cambridge
a
college
friend
of
featherstone
a
tall
man
with
a
refined
and
intellectual
face
and
reserved
manner
finally
there
was
otto
melick
a
litterateur
from
london
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
wiry
and
muscular
frame
and
the
restless
manner
of
one
who
lives
in
a
perpetual
fidget
for
some
time
nothing
was
said
they
partook
of
the
repast
in
silence
but
at
length
it
became
evident
that
they
were
thinking
of
the
mysterious
manuscript
featherstone
was
the
first
to
speak
a
deuced
queer
sort
of
thing
this
too
said
he
this
manuscript
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
who
ever
dreamed
of
people
living
at
the
south
pole
and
in
a
warm
climate
too
then
it
seems
deuced
odd
too
that
we
should
pick
up
this
copper
cylinder
with
the
manuscript
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
about
it
melick
smiled
why
it
is
much
to
see
through
said
he
see
through
what
said
the
doctor
hastily
pricking
up
his
ears
at
this
and
peering
keenly
at
melick
through
his
spectacles
why
the
manuscript
of
course
well
said
the
doctor
what
is
it
that
you
see
what
do
you
make
out
of
it
why
anyone
can
see
said
melick
that
it
a
transparent
hoax
that
all
you
do
mean
to
say
i
hope
that
you
really
regard
it
in
any
other
light
a
transparent
hoax
repeated
the
doctor
will
you
please
state
why
you
regard
it
in
that
light
certainly
said
melick
some
fellow
wanted
to
get
up
a
sensation
novel
and
introduce
it
to
the
world
with
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
and
so
he
has
taken
this
way
of
going
about
it
you
see
he
has
counted
on
its
being
picked
up
and
perhaps
published
after
this
he
would
come
forward
and
own
the
authorship
and
what
good
would
that
do
asked
the
doctor
mildly
he
prove
the
authorship
and
he
could
get
the
copyright
oh
of
course
not
but
he
would
gain
notoriety
and
that
would
give
him
a
great
sale
for
his
next
effort
the
doctor
smiled
see
here
melick
said
he
you
a
very
vivid
imagination
my
dear
fellow
but
come
let
us
discuss
this
for
a
little
while
in
a
way
now
how
long
should
you
suppose
that
this
manuscript
has
been
afloat
oh
a
few
months
or
so
said
melick
a
few
months
said
the
doctor
a
few
years
you
mean
why
man
there
are
successive
layers
of
barnacles
on
that
copper
cylinder
which
show
a
submersion
of
at
least
three
years
perhaps
more
by
jove
yes
remarked
featherstone
your
sensation
novelist
must
have
been
a
lunatic
if
he
chose
that
way
of
publishing
a
book
then
again
continued
the
doctor
how
did
it
get
here
oh
easily
enough
answered
melick
the
ocean
currents
brought
it
the
ocean
currents
repeated
the
doctor
that
a
very
vague
expression
what
do
you
mean
of
course
it
has
been
brought
here
by
the
ocean
currents
why
if
it
were
thrown
off
the
coast
of
england
it
would
be
carried
away
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
and
might
make
the
tour
of
the
world
the
ocean
currents
said
the
doctor
have
undoubtedly
brought
this
to
us
of
that
i
shall
have
more
to
say
presently
but
just
now
in
reference
to
your
notion
of
a
sensation
novelist
and
an
english
origin
let
me
ask
your
opinion
of
the
material
on
which
it
is
written
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
before
is
it
paper
no
said
melick
it
is
evidently
some
vegetable
substance
no
doubt
the
writer
has
had
it
prepared
for
this
very
purpose
so
as
to
make
it
look
natural
do
you
know
what
is
is
asked
the
doctor
no
then
i
tell
you
it
papyrus
papyrus
yes
actual
papyrus
you
can
find
but
little
of
that
in
existence
at
the
present
day
it
is
only
to
be
found
here
and
there
in
museums
i
know
it
perfectly
well
however
and
saw
what
it
was
at
the
first
glance
now
i
hold
that
a
sensation
novelist
would
never
have
thought
of
papyrus
if
he
did
wish
to
use
paper
he
could
have
found
a
dozen
other
things
i
do
see
how
he
could
have
found
anyone
able
to
prepare
such
a
substance
as
this
for
writing
it
must
have
come
from
a
country
where
it
is
actually
in
use
now
mark
you
the
may
still
be
found
growing
wild
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
nile
and
also
in
sicily
and
it
is
made
use
of
for
ropes
and
other
things
of
that
sort
but
as
to
making
writing
material
out
of
it
that
is
hardly
possible
for
the
art
is
lost
the
ancient
process
was
very
elaborate
and
this
manuscript
is
written
on
leaves
which
resembled
in
a
marvellous
manner
those
of
the
egyptian
papyrus
books
there
are
two
rolls
at
marseilles
which
i
have
seen
and
examined
and
they
are
identical
with
this
now
these
papyrus
leaves
indicate
much
mechanical
skill
and
have
a
professional
look
they
seem
like
the
work
of
an
experienced
manufacturer
i
do
see
said
melick
obstinately
why
one
should
get
papyrus
now
and
have
it
made
up
into
writing
material
oh
that
out
of
the
question
said
the
doctor
how
could
it
ever
enter
into
anyone
head
how
could
your
mere
procure
the
raw
material
that
of
itself
would
be
a
work
of
immense
difficulty
how
could
he
get
it
made
up
that
would
be
impossible
but
apart
from
this
just
consider
the
strong
internal
evidence
that
there
is
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
manuscript
now
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
description
of
desolation
island
which
is
perfectly
accurate
but
it
is
on
his
narrative
beyond
this
that
i
lay
chief
stress
i
can
prove
that
the
statements
here
are
corroborated
by
those
of
captain
ross
in
his
account
of
that
great
voyage
from
which
he
returned
not
very
long
ago
the
doctor
who
had
been
talking
with
much
enthusiasm
paused
here
to
take
breath
and
then
went
on
i
happen
to
know
all
about
that
voyage
for
i
read
a
full
report
of
it
just
before
we
started
and
you
can
see
for
yourselves
whether
this
manuscript
is
credible
or
not
captain
james
clarke
ross
was
sent
forth
on
his
expedition
in
on
january
he
passed
the
antarctic
circle
in
degrees
east
longitude
on
the
he
discovered
land
in
degrees
south
latitude
degrees
east
longitude
he
found
that
the
land
was
a
continuous
coast
trending
southward
and
rising
to
peaks
of
ten
thousand
feet
in
height
all
covered
with
ice
and
snow
on
the
he
landed
and
took
possession
in
the
name
of
the
queen
after
this
he
continued
his
course
as
far
as
degrees
south
latitude
tracing
a
of
six
hundred
miles
observe
now
how
all
this
coincides
with
more
narrative
well
i
now
come
to
the
crowning
statement
in
degrees
south
latitude
degrees
east
longitude
he
came
in
sight
of
two
enormous
volcanoes
over
twelve
thousand
feet
in
height
one
of
these
was
in
an
active
state
of
eruption
to
this
he
gave
the
name
of
mount
erebus
the
other
was
quiet
it
was
of
somewhat
less
height
and
he
gave
it
the
name
of
mount
terror
mark
now
how
wonderfully
this
resembles
more
account
well
just
here
his
progress
was
arrested
by
a
barrier
which
presented
a
perpendicular
wall
of
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
along
which
he
coasted
for
some
distance
on
the
following
year
he
penetrated
six
miles
farther
south
namely
degrees
south
latitude
degrees
west
longitude
at
this
point
he
was
again
stopped
by
the
impassable
cliffs
which
arose
here
like
an
eternal
barrier
while
beyond
them
he
saw
a
long
line
of
lofty
mountains
covered
with
ice
and
snow
did
you
hear
the
result
of
the
american
expedition
asked
melick
yes
replied
the
doctor
wilkes
pretends
to
have
found
a
continent
but
his
account
of
it
makes
it
quite
evident
to
my
mind
that
he
saw
nothing
but
ice
i
believe
that
wilkes
antarctic
continent
will
some
day
be
penetrated
by
ships
which
will
sail
for
hundreds
of
miles
farther
south
all
that
is
wanted
is
a
favorable
season
but
mark
the
coincidence
between
ross
report
and
more
manuscript
this
must
have
been
written
at
least
three
years
ago
and
the
writer
could
not
have
known
anything
about
ross
discoveries
above
all
he
could
not
have
thought
of
those
two
volcanoes
unless
he
had
seen
them
but
these
volcanoes
mentioned
by
more
are
not
the
erebus
and
terror
are
they
said
lord
featherstone
of
course
not
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
the
whole
story
said
melick
may
have
been
written
by
one
of
ross
men
and
thrown
overboard
if
i
been
on
that
expedition
i
should
probably
have
written
it
to
beguile
the
time
oh
yes
said
the
doctor
and
you
would
also
have
manufactured
the
papyrus
and
the
copper
cylinder
on
board
to
beguile
the
time
i
dare
say
the
writer
picked
up
that
papyrus
and
the
copper
cylinder
in
china
or
japan
and
made
use
of
it
in
this
way
where
do
you
make
out
the
position
of
more
volcanoes
asked
featherstone
it
is
difficult
to
make
it
out
accurately
said
the
doctor
more
gives
no
data
in
fact
he
had
none
to
give
he
could
take
any
observations
the
fact
is
said
melick
it
not
a
sailor
yarn
at
all
no
sailor
would
ever
express
himself
in
that
way
that
what
struck
me
from
the
first
it
has
the
ring
of
a
confounded
all
through
the
doctor
elevated
his
eyebrows
but
took
no
notice
of
this
you
see
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
the
others
desolation
island
is
in
degrees
south
latitude
and
degrees
east
longitude
as
i
make
out
more
course
led
him
over
about
ten
degrees
of
longitude
in
a
southwest
course
that
course
depended
altogether
upon
the
ocean
currents
now
there
is
a
great
antarctic
which
flows
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
divides
there
one
half
flowing
past
the
east
coast
of
africa
and
the
other
setting
across
the
indian
ocean
then
it
unites
with
a
current
which
flows
round
the
south
of
van
dieman
land
which
also
divides
and
the
southernmost
current
is
supposed
to
cross
the
pacific
until
it
strikes
cape
horn
around
which
it
flows
dividing
as
before
now
my
theory
is
that
south
of
desolation
island
i
do
know
how
far
there
is
a
great
current
setting
toward
the
south
pole
and
running
southwest
through
degrees
of
longitude
east
of
greenwich
and
finally
sweeping
on
it
would
reach
more
volcanoes
at
a
point
which
i
should
judge
to
be
about
degrees
south
latitude
and
degrees
west
longitude
there
it
passes
between
the
volcanoes
and
bursts
through
the
vast
mountain
barrier
by
a
subterranean
way
which
has
been
formed
for
it
in
past
ages
by
some
primeval
convulsion
of
nature
after
this
it
probably
sweeps
around
the
great
south
polar
ocean
and
emerges
at
the
opposite
side
not
far
from
the
volcanoes
erebus
and
terror
here
the
doctor
paused
and
looked
around
with
some
oh
said
melick
if
you
take
that
tone
you
have
us
all
at
your
mercy
i
know
no
more
about
the
geography
of
the
antarctic
circle
than
i
do
of
the
moon
i
simply
criticize
from
a
literary
point
of
view
and
i
do
like
his
underground
cavern
with
the
stream
running
through
it
it
sounds
like
one
of
the
voyages
of
sinbad
the
sailor
nor
do
i
like
his
description
he
evidently
is
writing
for
effect
besides
his
style
is
vicious
it
is
too
stilted
finally
he
has
recourse
to
the
stale
device
of
a
a
repeated
the
doctor
well
for
my
part
i
feel
by
no
means
inclined
to
sneer
at
a
its
existence
can
not
be
proved
yet
it
can
not
be
every
schoolboy
knows
that
the
waters
of
the
sea
were
once
filled
with
monsters
more
tremendous
than
the
greatest
that
has
ever
been
imagined
the
plesiosaurus
with
its
snakelike
head
if
it
existed
now
would
be
called
a
some
of
these
fossil
animals
may
have
their
representatives
still
living
in
the
remoter
parts
of
the
world
think
of
the
recently
discovered
ornithorhynchus
of
australia
if
you
please
i
really
much
rather
not
said
melick
with
a
gesture
of
despair
i
have
the
honor
of
the
acquaintance
well
what
do
you
think
of
his
notice
of
the
sun
and
the
long
light
and
his
low
position
on
the
horizon
oh
that
all
right
said
melick
anyone
who
chose
to
get
up
this
thing
would
of
course
read
up
about
the
polar
day
and
all
that
everyone
knows
that
at
the
poles
there
is
a
day
followed
by
a
night
you
are
a
determined
sceptic
said
the
doctor
how
is
it
about
the
polar
day
asked
featherstone
well
said
the
doctor
at
the
poles
themselves
there
is
one
day
of
six
months
during
which
the
sun
never
sets
and
one
night
of
six
months
during
which
he
never
rises
in
the
spaces
between
the
polar
circles
the
quantities
of
the
continuous
day
and
continuous
night
vary
in
accordance
with
the
distance
from
the
pole
at
the
north
point
of
nova
zembla
degrees
north
latitude
there
is
uninterrupted
light
from
may
to
august
and
uninterrupted
darkness
from
november
to
february
at
the
arctic
circle
at
the
summer
solstice
the
day
is
hours
long
at
the
antarctic
circle
at
the
same
time
the
night
is
hours
long
upon
this
melick
filled
the
doctor
with
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
after
all
those
statistics
he
said
you
must
feel
rather
dry
you
should
take
a
drink
before
venturing
any
further
the
doctor
made
no
reply
but
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
swallowed
the
wine
in
an
abstracted
way
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
said
oxenden
in
all
that
has
been
read
thus
far
is
the
flatness
of
the
south
pole
and
the
peculiar
effect
which
this
produces
on
the
landscape
i
must
say
added
melick
that
the
writer
has
got
hold
of
a
very
good
idea
there
and
has
taken
care
to
put
it
forward
in
a
very
prominent
fashion
what
is
the
difference
asked
oxenden
between
the
two
diameters
of
the
earth
the
polar
and
the
equatorial
is
it
known
by
jove
said
featherstone
that
the
very
question
i
was
going
to
ask
i
always
heard
that
the
earth
is
flattened
at
the
poles
but
never
knew
how
much
is
there
any
way
by
which
people
can
find
out
the
doctor
drew
a
long
breath
and
beamed
upon
the
company
with
a
benevolent
smile
oh
yes
said
he
i
can
answer
that
question
if
you
care
to
know
and
wo
feel
bored
answer
it
then
my
dear
fellow
by
all
means
said
featherstone
in
his
most
languid
tone
there
are
two
ways
said
the
doctor
by
which
the
polar
compression
of
the
earth
has
been
found
out
one
is
by
the
measurement
of
arcs
on
the
earth
surface
the
other
is
by
experiments
with
pendulums
or
weights
with
regard
to
the
earth
gravity
at
different
places
the
former
of
these
methods
is
perhaps
the
more
satisfactory
measurements
of
arcs
have
been
made
on
a
very
extensive
scale
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
england
france
lapland
peru
and
india
ivory
who
devoted
himself
for
years
to
an
exhaustive
examination
of
the
subject
has
deduced
that
the
equatorial
radius
of
the
earth
is
over
miles
and
the
polar
radius
over
miles
this
makes
the
depression
at
either
pole
upward
of
thirteen
miles
a
depression
of
over
thirteen
miles
as
you
must
plainly
see
should
produce
strange
results
in
the
scenery
at
the
poles
of
course
if
there
are
mountains
no
difference
would
be
noticed
between
this
and
any
other
part
of
the
earth
surface
but
if
there
is
water
why
we
ought
to
expect
some
such
state
of
things
as
more
describes
the
gravitation
test
has
also
been
tried
with
very
nearly
the
same
result
the
surface
of
the
earth
at
the
equator
being
farthest
from
the
centre
of
gravity
indicates
the
least
weight
in
bodies
but
at
the
poles
where
the
surface
is
nearest
the
centre
of
gravity
there
must
be
the
greatest
weight
it
is
found
in
fact
that
the
weight
of
bodies
increases
in
passing
from
the
equator
to
the
poles
by
experiments
made
in
this
way
the
polar
compression
is
ascertained
to
be
the
same
as
i
have
mentioned
what
effect
would
this
have
on
the
climate
at
the
poles
asked
oxenden
that
a
complicated
question
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
that
we
must
leave
ascertained
facts
and
trust
to
theories
unless
indeed
we
accept
as
valid
the
statements
of
this
remarkable
manuscript
for
my
own
part
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
as
more
says
remember
this
polar
world
is
thirteen
miles
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
whether
this
should
affect
the
climate
or
not
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
earth
interior
that
interior
according
to
the
popular
theory
of
the
present
day
is
a
mass
of
fire
this
theory
affirms
that
the
earth
was
once
a
mass
which
has
cooled
down
but
the
cooling
process
has
only
taken
place
on
the
surface
leaving
the
interior
still
a
molten
mass
of
matter
in
a
state
of
intense
heat
and
combustion
at
the
poles
the
surface
is
thus
thirteen
miles
nearer
to
these
tremendous
fires
of
course
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
earth
crust
is
of
about
equal
thickness
on
all
parts
yet
still
even
if
this
be
so
thirteen
miles
ought
to
make
some
difference
now
at
the
north
pole
there
seem
to
be
causes
at
work
to
counterbalance
the
effect
of
the
internal
heat
chiefly
in
the
enormous
accumulation
of
polar
ice
which
probably
hems
it
in
on
every
side
and
though
many
believe
in
an
open
polar
sea
of
warm
water
at
the
north
pole
yet
still
the
effect
of
vast
and
of
cold
submarine
currents
must
be
to
render
the
climate
severe
but
at
the
south
pole
it
is
different
the
observations
of
ross
and
of
more
show
us
that
there
is
a
chain
of
mountains
of
immense
height
which
seem
to
encircle
the
pole
if
this
be
so
and
i
see
no
reason
to
disbelieve
it
then
the
ice
of
the
outer
seas
must
be
kept
away
altogether
from
that
strange
inner
sea
of
which
more
speaks
ross
saw
the
volcanoes
erebus
and
terror
more
saw
two
others
how
many
more
there
may
be
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
all
this
shows
that
the
effect
of
the
internal
fires
is
very
manifest
in
that
region
and
more
has
penetrated
to
a
secluded
world
which
lies
apart
by
itself
free
from
the
influence
of
left
to
feel
the
effect
of
the
internal
fires
and
possessing
what
is
virtually
a
tropical
climate
well
said
melick
there
is
no
theory
however
wild
and
fantastic
which
some
man
of
science
will
not
be
ready
to
support
and
to
fortify
by
endless
arguments
all
of
the
most
plausible
kind
for
my
own
part
i
still
believe
more
and
his
south
polar
world
to
be
no
more
authentic
than
sindbad
the
sailor
but
the
others
evidently
sympathized
with
the
doctor
view
and
regarded
melick
as
carrying
his
scepticism
to
an
absurd
excess
how
large
do
you
suppose
this
south
polar
ocean
to
be
asked
featherstone
it
is
impossible
to
answer
that
question
exactly
said
the
doctor
it
may
be
as
more
hints
a
thousand
miles
in
extent
or
only
five
hundred
or
two
hundred
for
my
own
part
however
i
feel
like
taking
more
statements
at
their
utmost
value
and
the
idea
that
i
have
gathered
from
his
narrative
is
that
of
a
vast
sea
like
the
mediterranean
surrounded
by
impassable
mountains
by
great
and
fertile
countries
peopled
with
an
immense
variety
of
animals
with
a
fauna
and
flora
quite
unlike
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
above
all
with
great
nations
possessing
a
rare
and
unique
civilization
and
belonging
to
a
race
altogether
different
from
any
of
the
known
races
of
men
well
said
melick
that
at
least
is
the
idea
which
the
writer
of
the
manuscript
tries
to
convey
by
this
time
they
had
finished
dinner
and
now
said
featherstone
let
have
some
more
of
the
manuscript
melick
is
tired
of
it
i
dare
say
i
would
relieve
him
but
i
an
infernally
bad
reader
doctor
what
do
you
say
will
you
read
the
next
instalment
with
all
my
heart
said
the
doctor
briskly
very
well
then
said
featherstone
we
will
all
be
your
attentive
hearers
and
now
the
doctor
took
up
the
manuscript
and
began
to
read
chapter
viii
the
the
cavern
into
which
the
chief
led
me
was
very
spacious
but
had
no
light
except
that
which
entered
through
the
portal
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
see
anything
but
i
found
that
there
were
many
people
here
moving
about
all
as
intent
upon
their
own
pursuits
as
those
which
one
encounters
in
the
streets
of
our
cities
as
we
went
on
farther
the
darkness
increased
until
at
last
i
lost
sight
of
the
chief
altogether
and
he
had
to
come
back
and
lead
me
after
going
a
little
farther
we
came
to
a
long
broad
like
a
subterranean
street
about
twenty
feet
in
width
and
as
many
in
height
here
there
were
discernible
a
few
twinkling
lamps
which
served
to
make
the
darkness
less
intense
and
enabled
me
to
see
the
shadowy
figures
around
these
were
numerous
and
all
seemed
busy
though
what
their
occupation
might
be
i
could
not
guess
i
was
amazed
at
the
extent
of
these
caverns
and
at
the
multitude
of
the
people
i
saw
also
that
from
the
nature
of
their
eyes
the
sunlight
distressed
them
and
in
this
cavern
gloom
they
found
their
most
congenial
from
what
i
had
thus
far
seen
this
extraordinary
people
shrank
from
the
sunlight
and
when
they
had
to
move
abroad
they
passed
over
roads
which
were
darkened
as
much
as
possible
by
the
deep
shadows
of
mighty
ferns
while
for
the
most
part
they
remained
in
dark
caverns
in
which
they
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
being
it
was
a
puzzle
to
me
whether
the
weakness
of
their
eyes
had
caused
this
dislike
of
light
or
the
habit
of
had
caused
this
weakness
of
eyes
here
in
this
darkness
where
there
was
but
a
faint
twinkle
from
the
feeble
lamps
their
eyes
seemed
to
serve
them
as
well
as
mine
did
in
the
outer
light
of
day
and
the
chief
who
outside
had
moved
with
an
uncertain
step
and
had
blinked
painfully
at
objects
with
his
eyes
almost
closed
now
appeared
to
be
in
his
proper
element
and
while
i
hesitated
like
a
blind
man
and
groped
along
with
a
faltering
step
he
guided
me
and
seemed
to
see
everything
with
perfect
vision
at
length
we
stopped
and
the
chief
raised
up
a
thick
heavy
mat
which
hung
like
an
unwieldly
curtain
in
front
of
a
doorway
this
the
chief
lifted
at
once
a
blaze
of
light
burst
forth
gleaming
into
the
dark
and
appearing
to
blind
him
his
eyes
closed
he
held
up
the
veil
for
me
to
pass
through
i
did
so
he
followed
and
then
groped
his
way
slowly
along
while
i
accompanied
and
assisted
him
i
now
found
myself
in
a
large
grotto
with
an
arched
roof
from
which
was
suspended
an
enormous
lamp
either
golden
or
gilded
all
around
were
numerous
lamps
the
walls
were
adorned
with
rich
hangings
couches
were
here
with
soft
cushions
and
divans
and
ottomans
soft
mats
were
on
the
floor
and
everything
gave
indications
of
luxury
and
wealth
other
doors
covered
with
overhanging
mats
seemed
to
lead
out
of
this
grotto
to
one
of
these
the
chief
walked
and
raising
the
mat
he
led
the
way
into
another
grotto
like
the
last
with
the
same
bright
lights
and
the
same
adornments
but
of
smaller
size
here
i
saw
someone
who
at
once
took
up
all
my
attention
it
was
a
young
maiden
her
face
and
form
but
especially
her
eyes
showed
her
to
be
of
quite
a
different
race
from
these
others
to
me
she
was
of
medium
height
yet
she
was
taller
than
any
of
the
people
here
that
i
had
hitherto
seen
her
complexion
was
much
lighter
her
hair
was
dark
luxuriant
and
wavy
and
arranged
in
a
coiffure
secured
with
a
golden
band
her
features
were
of
a
different
cast
from
those
of
the
people
here
for
they
were
regular
in
outline
and
of
exquisite
beauty
her
nose
was
straight
she
had
a
short
upper
lip
arched
eyebrows
finely
pencilled
thin
lips
and
chin
but
the
chief
contrast
was
in
her
eyes
these
were
large
dark
liquid
with
long
lashes
and
with
a
splendid
glow
in
their
lustrous
depths
she
stood
looking
at
me
with
her
face
full
of
amazement
and
as
i
caught
the
gaze
of
her
glorious
eyes
i
rejoiced
that
i
had
at
last
found
one
who
lived
in
the
light
and
loved
it
one
who
did
not
blink
like
a
bat
but
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
allowed
me
to
see
all
her
soul
revealed
the
chief
who
still
was
pained
by
the
glare
of
light
kept
his
eyes
covered
and
said
a
few
hasty
words
to
the
maiden
after
this
he
hurried
away
leaving
me
there
the
maiden
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
me
as
the
chief
spoke
to
her
a
change
came
over
her
face
she
looked
at
me
in
silence
with
an
expression
of
sad
and
mournful
interest
which
seemed
to
increase
every
moment
at
length
she
approached
and
said
something
in
the
same
strange
language
which
the
chief
had
used
i
shook
my
head
and
replied
in
english
whereupon
she
shook
her
head
with
a
look
of
perplexity
then
anxious
to
conciliate
her
i
held
out
my
hand
she
looked
at
it
in
some
surprise
upon
this
i
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
feeling
however
somewhat
doubtful
as
to
the
way
in
which
she
might
receive
such
an
advance
to
my
great
delight
she
accepted
it
in
a
friendly
spirit
and
seemed
to
consider
it
my
foreign
fashion
of
showing
friendship
and
respect
she
smiled
and
nodded
and
pointed
to
my
gun
which
thus
far
i
had
carried
in
my
hand
i
smiled
and
laid
it
down
then
she
pointed
to
a
seat
i
sat
down
and
then
she
seated
herself
close
by
me
and
we
looked
at
each
other
in
mutual
wonder
and
mutual
inquiry
i
was
full
of
amazement
at
thus
meeting
with
so
exquisite
a
being
and
lost
myself
in
conjectures
as
to
her
race
her
office
and
her
position
here
who
was
she
or
what
she
was
unlike
the
others
and
reminded
me
of
those
oriental
beauties
whose
portraits
i
had
seen
in
annuals
and
illustrated
books
her
costume
was
in
keeping
with
such
a
character
she
wore
a
long
tunic
that
reached
from
the
neck
to
the
ground
secured
at
the
waist
with
a
golden
girdle
the
sleeves
were
long
and
loose
over
this
she
had
a
long
mantle
on
her
feet
were
light
slippers
white
and
glistening
all
about
her
in
her
room
and
in
her
costume
spoke
of
light
and
splendor
and
luxury
to
these
others
who
shrank
so
from
the
light
she
could
not
be
related
in
any
way
the
respect
with
which
she
was
treated
by
the
chief
the
peculiar
splendor
of
her
apartments
seemed
to
indicate
some
high
rank
was
she
then
the
queen
of
the
land
was
she
a
princess
i
could
not
tell
at
any
rate
whatever
she
was
she
seemed
anxious
to
show
me
the
utmost
attention
her
manner
was
full
of
dignity
and
sweet
graciousness
and
she
appeared
particularly
anxious
to
make
herself
understood
at
first
she
spoke
in
a
language
that
sounded
like
that
of
the
chief
and
was
full
of
gutturals
and
broad
vowels
afterward
she
spoke
in
another
that
was
far
more
euphonious
i
on
the
other
hand
spoke
in
english
and
in
french
but
of
course
i
was
as
unintelligible
to
her
as
she
was
to
me
language
was
therefore
of
no
use
it
was
necessary
to
go
back
to
first
principles
and
make
use
of
signs
or
try
to
gain
the
most
elementary
words
of
her
language
so
first
of
all
i
pointed
to
her
and
tried
to
indicate
that
i
wanted
to
know
her
name
she
caught
my
meaning
at
once
and
pointing
to
herself
she
looked
fixedly
at
me
and
said
almah
almah
i
repeated
these
words
after
her
saying
almah
almah
she
smiled
and
nodded
and
then
pointed
to
me
with
a
look
of
inquiry
that
plainly
asked
for
my
name
i
said
adam
more
she
repeated
this
and
it
sounded
like
but
as
she
spoke
this
slowly
her
smile
died
away
she
looked
anxious
and
troubled
and
once
more
that
expression
of
wondering
sadness
came
over
her
face
she
repeated
my
name
over
and
over
in
this
way
with
a
mournful
intonation
that
thrilled
through
me
and
excited
forebodings
of
evil
atamor
atamor
and
always
after
that
she
called
me
atamor
but
now
she
sat
for
some
time
looking
at
me
with
a
face
full
of
pity
and
distress
at
this
i
was
greatly
astonished
for
but
a
moment
before
she
had
been
full
of
smiles
and
it
was
as
though
something
in
my
name
had
excited
sorrowful
thoughts
yet
how
could
that
be
since
she
could
never
by
any
possibility
have
heard
my
name
before
the
beautiful
almah
seemed
to
be
not
altogether
happy
or
why
should
she
be
so
quick
to
sadness
there
was
a
mystery
about
all
this
which
was
quite
unaccountable
it
was
a
singular
situation
and
one
which
excited
within
me
feelings
of
unutterable
delight
this
light
and
splendor
this
warmth
and
peace
what
a
contrast
it
offered
to
the
scenes
through
which
i
had
but
lately
passed
those
scenes
of
horror
of
ice
and
snow
of
storm
and
tempest
of
cold
and
hunger
of
riven
cliff
and
furious
ocean
stream
and
above
all
that
crowning
agony
in
the
bleak
of
the
cannibals
from
all
these
i
had
escaped
i
had
been
drawn
down
under
the
earth
to
experience
the
terrors
of
that
unspeakable
passage
and
had
at
last
emerged
to
light
and
life
to
joy
and
hope
in
this
grotto
i
had
found
the
culmination
of
all
happiness
it
was
like
a
fairy
realm
and
here
was
one
whose
very
look
was
enough
to
inspire
the
most
despairing
soul
with
hope
and
peace
and
happiness
the
only
thing
that
was
now
left
to
trouble
me
was
this
mournful
face
of
almah
why
did
she
look
at
me
with
such
sad
interest
and
such
melancholy
meaning
did
she
know
of
any
evil
fate
in
store
for
me
yet
how
could
there
be
any
evil
fate
to
be
feared
from
people
who
had
received
me
with
such
unparalleled
generosity
no
it
could
not
be
so
i
resolved
to
try
to
bring
back
again
the
smile
that
had
faded
out
of
her
face
i
pointed
to
her
and
said
almah
she
said
and
the
smile
did
not
come
back
but
the
sadness
remained
in
her
face
my
eager
desire
now
was
to
learn
her
language
and
i
resolved
at
once
to
acquire
as
many
words
and
phrases
as
possible
i
began
by
asking
the
names
of
things
such
as
seat
table
mat
coat
hat
shoe
lamp
floor
wall
and
all
the
common
objects
around
she
gave
all
the
names
and
soon
became
so
deeply
interested
that
her
sadness
departed
and
the
smile
came
back
once
more
for
my
own
part
i
was
always
rather
quick
at
learning
languages
i
had
a
correct
ear
and
a
retentive
memory
in
my
wanderings
round
the
world
i
had
picked
up
a
smattering
of
many
languages
such
as
french
italian
spanish
arabic
german
hindoostanee
and
a
few
others
the
words
which
i
learned
from
almah
had
a
remote
resemblance
to
arabic
and
in
fact
my
knowledge
of
arabic
was
actually
of
some
assistance
though
how
it
was
that
these
people
should
have
a
language
with
that
resemblance
was
certainly
a
mystery
and
i
did
not
try
to
solve
it
the
beautiful
almah
soon
grew
immensely
interested
in
my
efforts
to
learn
and
also
in
the
english
words
which
i
gave
when
i
pointed
to
any
object
thus
i
pointed
to
myself
and
said
man
then
pointing
to
her
i
said
woman
she
laughed
and
pointing
to
me
said
iz
and
pointing
to
herself
said
izza
then
i
pointed
to
the
row
of
lights
and
said
light
she
did
the
same
and
said
or
then
her
face
grew
mournful
and
she
pointed
to
me
saying
it
struck
me
then
that
there
was
some
chance
resemblance
between
or
the
word
meaning
light
and
one
of
the
syllables
of
my
name
as
she
pronounced
it
and
that
this
might
cause
her
sadness
but
as
i
could
make
out
nothing
of
this
i
dismissed
the
thought
and
went
on
with
my
questions
this
took
up
the
time
until
at
length
someone
appeared
who
looked
like
a
servant
he
said
something
whereupon
almah
arose
and
beckoned
to
me
to
follow
i
did
so
and
we
went
to
a
neighboring
apartment
where
there
was
spread
a
bounteous
repast
here
we
sat
and
ate
and
almah
told
me
the
names
of
all
the
dishes
after
dinner
we
returned
to
the
room
it
was
a
singular
and
a
delightful
position
i
was
left
alone
with
the
beautiful
almah
who
herself
showed
the
utmost
graciousness
and
the
kindest
interest
in
me
i
could
not
understand
it
nor
did
i
try
to
it
was
enough
that
i
had
such
a
happy
lot
for
hours
we
thus
were
together
and
i
learned
many
words
to
insure
remembrance
i
wrote
them
down
in
my
with
a
pencil
and
both
of
these
were
regarded
by
almah
with
greatest
curiosity
she
felt
the
paper
inspected
it
touched
it
with
her
tongue
and
seemed
to
admire
it
greatly
but
the
pencil
excited
still
greater
admiration
i
signed
to
her
to
write
in
the
book
she
did
so
but
the
characters
were
quite
unlike
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
not
joined
like
our
writing
and
like
arabic
letters
but
were
separate
like
our
printed
type
and
were
formed
in
an
irregular
manner
she
then
showed
me
a
book
made
of
a
strange
substance
it
was
filled
with
characters
like
those
which
she
had
just
written
the
leaves
were
not
at
all
like
paper
but
seemed
like
some
vegetable
product
such
as
the
leaves
of
a
plant
or
the
bark
of
a
tree
they
were
very
thin
very
smooth
all
cut
into
regular
size
and
fastened
together
by
means
of
rings
this
manuscript
is
written
upon
the
same
material
i
afterward
found
that
it
was
universally
used
here
and
was
made
of
a
reed
that
grows
in
marshes
here
in
these
vast
caverns
there
was
no
way
by
which
i
could
tell
the
progress
of
time
but
almah
had
her
own
way
of
finding
out
when
the
hours
of
wakeful
life
were
over
she
arose
and
said
salonla
this
i
afterward
found
out
to
be
common
salutation
of
the
country
i
said
it
after
her
she
then
left
me
shortly
afterward
a
servant
appeared
who
took
me
to
a
room
which
i
understood
to
be
mine
here
i
found
everything
that
i
could
wish
either
for
comfort
or
luxury
and
as
i
felt
fatigue
i
flung
myself
upon
the
soft
bed
of
down
and
soon
was
sound
asleep
i
slept
for
a
long
time
when
i
awoke
i
heard
sounds
in
the
distance
and
knew
that
people
were
moving
here
in
these
caverns
there
was
no
difference
between
day
and
night
but
by
modes
of
which
i
was
ignorant
a
regular
succession
was
observed
of
waking
times
and
sleeping
times
chapter
ix
the
cavern
of
the
dead
on
going
forth
into
the
outer
grotto
i
saw
the
table
spread
with
a
sumptuous
repast
and
the
apartment
in
a
blaze
of
light
almah
was
not
here
and
though
some
servants
made
signs
for
me
to
eat
yet
i
could
not
until
i
should
see
whether
she
was
coming
or
not
i
had
to
wait
for
a
long
time
however
and
while
i
was
waiting
the
chief
entered
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
from
the
painful
light
he
bowed
low
with
the
most
profound
courtesy
saying
salonla
to
which
i
responded
in
the
same
way
he
seemed
much
pleased
at
this
and
made
a
few
remarks
which
i
did
not
understand
whereupon
anxious
to
lose
no
time
in
learning
the
language
i
repeated
to
him
all
the
words
i
knew
and
asked
after
others
i
pointed
to
him
and
asked
his
name
he
said
kohen
this
however
i
afterward
found
was
not
a
name
but
a
title
the
kohen
did
not
remain
long
for
the
light
was
painful
after
his
departure
i
was
alone
for
some
time
and
at
length
almah
made
her
appearance
i
sprang
to
meet
her
full
of
joy
and
took
her
hand
in
both
of
mine
and
pressed
it
warmly
she
smiled
and
appeared
quite
free
from
the
melancholy
of
the
previous
day
we
ate
our
breakfast
together
after
which
we
went
out
into
the
world
of
light
groping
our
way
along
through
the
dark
passages
amid
the
busy
crowd
almah
could
see
better
than
i
in
the
darkness
but
she
was
far
from
seeing
well
and
did
not
move
with
that
easy
step
and
perfect
certainty
which
all
the
others
showed
like
me
she
was
a
child
of
light
and
the
darkness
was
distressing
to
her
as
we
went
on
we
were
seen
by
all
but
were
apparently
not
considered
prisoners
on
the
contrary
all
looked
at
us
with
the
deepest
respect
and
bowed
low
or
moved
aside
and
occasionally
made
little
offerings
of
fruit
or
flowers
to
one
or
the
other
of
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
treated
with
equal
distinction
and
if
almah
was
their
queen
i
their
guest
was
regarded
with
equal
honor
whatever
her
rank
might
be
however
she
was
to
all
appearance
the
most
absolute
mistress
of
her
own
actions
and
moved
about
among
all
these
people
with
the
independence
and
dignity
of
some
person
of
exalted
rank
at
length
we
emerged
into
the
open
air
here
the
contrast
to
the
cavern
gloom
inside
gave
to
the
outer
world
unusual
brightness
and
splendor
so
that
even
under
the
heavy
overarching
which
had
seemed
so
dark
when
i
was
here
before
it
now
appeared
light
and
cheerful
almah
turned
to
the
right
and
we
walked
along
the
terrace
but
few
people
were
visible
they
shrank
from
the
light
and
kept
themselves
in
the
caverns
then
after
a
few
steps
we
came
to
the
base
of
a
tall
the
summit
of
which
was
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
pointed
to
this
as
though
i
wished
to
go
up
almah
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
seemed
to
shrink
back
but
at
length
overcoming
her
reluctance
began
the
ascent
a
flight
of
stony
steps
led
up
on
reaching
the
top
i
found
it
about
thirty
feet
long
by
fifteen
wide
with
a
high
stone
table
in
the
middle
at
that
moment
however
i
scarce
noticed
the
pyramid
summit
and
i
only
describe
it
now
because
i
was
fated
before
long
to
see
it
with
different
feelings
what
i
then
noticed
was
the
vast
and
wondrous
display
of
all
the
glories
of
nature
that
burst
at
once
upon
my
view
there
was
that
same
boundless
sea
rising
up
high
toward
the
horizon
as
i
had
seen
it
before
and
suggesting
infinite
extent
there
were
the
blue
waters
breaking
into
foam
the
ships
traversing
the
deep
the
shores
green
in
vegetation
the
high
rampart
of
mountains
that
shut
in
the
land
making
it
a
world
by
itself
there
was
the
sun
low
on
the
horizon
which
it
traversed
on
its
long
orbit
lighting
up
all
these
scenes
till
the
day
should
end
and
the
night
begin
for
a
long
time
i
stood
feasting
my
eyes
upon
all
this
splendor
and
at
length
turned
to
see
whether
almah
shared
my
feelings
one
look
was
enough
she
stood
absorbed
in
the
scene
as
though
she
were
drinking
in
deep
draughts
of
all
this
matchless
beauty
i
felt
amazed
at
this
i
saw
how
different
she
seemed
from
the
others
and
could
not
account
for
it
but
as
yet
i
knew
too
little
of
the
language
to
question
her
and
could
only
hope
for
a
future
explanation
when
i
had
learned
more
we
descended
at
length
and
walked
about
the
terrace
and
up
and
down
the
side
streets
all
were
the
same
as
i
had
noticed
before
terraced
streets
with
caverns
on
one
side
and
massive
stone
structures
on
the
other
i
saw
deep
channels
which
were
used
as
drains
to
carry
down
mountain
torrents
i
did
not
see
all
at
this
first
walk
but
i
inspected
the
whole
city
in
many
subsequent
walks
until
its
outlines
were
all
familiar
i
found
it
about
a
mile
long
and
about
half
a
mile
wide
constructed
in
a
series
of
terraces
which
rose
one
above
another
in
a
hollow
of
the
mountains
round
a
harbor
of
the
sea
on
my
walks
i
met
with
but
few
people
on
the
streets
and
they
all
seemed
troubled
with
the
light
i
saw
also
occasionally
some
more
of
those
great
birds
the
name
of
which
i
learned
from
almah
it
was
opkuk
for
some
time
my
life
went
on
most
delightfully
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
every
comfort
and
luxury
almah
was
my
constant
associate
and
all
around
regarded
us
with
the
profoundest
respect
the
people
were
the
mildest
most
gentle
and
most
generous
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
kohen
seemed
to
pass
most
of
his
time
in
making
new
contrivances
for
my
happiness
this
strange
people
in
their
dealings
with
me
and
with
one
another
seemed
animated
by
a
universal
desire
to
do
kindly
acts
and
the
only
possible
objection
against
them
was
their
singular
love
of
darkness
my
freedom
was
absolute
no
one
watched
me
almah
and
i
could
go
where
we
chose
so
far
as
i
could
perceive
we
were
quite
at
liberty
if
we
wished
to
take
a
boat
and
escape
over
the
sea
it
seemed
also
quite
likely
that
if
we
had
ordered
out
a
galley
and
a
gang
of
oarsmen
we
should
have
been
supplied
with
all
that
we
might
want
in
the
most
cheerful
manner
such
a
thought
however
was
absurd
flight
why
should
i
think
of
flying
i
had
long
ago
lost
all
idea
of
time
and
here
where
it
was
for
the
present
perpetual
day
i
was
more
at
a
loss
than
ever
i
supposed
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
month
of
march
but
whether
at
the
beginning
or
the
end
i
could
not
tell
the
people
had
a
regular
system
of
and
by
which
they
ordered
their
lives
but
whether
these
respective
times
were
longer
or
shorter
than
the
days
and
nights
at
home
i
could
not
tell
at
that
time
though
i
afterward
learned
all
about
it
on
the
whole
i
was
perfectly
content
nay
more
perfectly
happy
more
so
indeed
than
ever
in
my
life
and
quite
willing
to
forget
home
and
friends
and
everything
in
the
society
of
almah
while
in
her
company
there
was
always
one
purpose
upon
which
i
was
most
intent
and
that
was
to
master
the
language
i
made
rapid
progress
and
while
she
was
absent
i
sought
out
others
especially
the
kohen
with
whom
to
practice
the
kohen
was
always
most
eager
to
aid
me
in
every
conceivable
way
or
to
any
conceivable
thing
and
he
had
such
a
gentle
manner
and
showed
such
generous
qualities
that
i
soon
learned
to
regard
him
with
positive
affection
almah
was
always
absent
for
several
hours
after
i
rose
in
the
morning
and
when
she
made
her
appearance
it
was
with
the
face
and
manner
of
one
who
had
returned
from
some
unpleasant
task
it
always
took
some
time
for
her
to
regain
that
cheerfulness
which
she
usually
showed
i
soon
felt
a
deep
curiosity
to
learn
the
nature
of
her
employment
and
office
here
and
as
my
knowledge
of
the
language
increased
i
began
to
question
her
my
first
attempts
were
vain
she
looked
at
me
with
indescribable
mournfulness
and
shook
her
head
this
however
only
confirmed
me
in
my
suspicions
that
her
duties
whatever
they
might
be
were
of
a
painful
nature
so
i
urged
her
to
tell
me
and
asked
her
as
well
as
i
could
if
i
might
not
share
them
or
help
her
in
some
way
to
all
this
however
she
only
returned
sighs
and
mournful
looks
for
an
answer
it
seemed
to
me
from
her
manner
and
from
the
general
behavior
of
the
people
that
there
was
no
express
prohibition
on
my
learning
anything
doing
anything
or
going
anywhere
and
so
after
this
i
besought
her
to
let
me
accompany
her
some
time
but
this
too
she
refused
my
requests
were
often
made
and
as
i
learned
more
and
more
of
the
language
i
was
able
to
make
them
with
more
earnestness
and
effect
until
at
length
i
succeeded
in
overcoming
her
objections
it
is
for
your
own
sake
said
she
that
i
have
refused
i
do
not
wish
to
lessen
your
happiness
but
you
must
know
all
soon
and
so
if
you
wish
to
come
with
me
and
see
what
i
have
to
do
why
you
may
come
the
next
jom
this
meant
the
next
day
jom
being
the
division
of
time
corresponding
with
our
day
at
this
promise
i
was
so
full
of
gratitude
that
i
forgot
all
about
the
dark
suggestiveness
of
her
words
the
next
jom
i
arose
sooner
than
usual
and
went
forth
i
found
almah
waiting
for
me
she
looked
troubled
and
greeted
me
with
a
mournful
smile
you
will
find
pain
in
this
said
she
but
you
wish
it
and
if
you
still
wish
it
why
i
will
take
you
with
me
at
this
i
only
persisted
the
more
and
so
we
set
forth
we
went
through
the
cavern
passages
few
people
were
there
all
seemed
asleep
then
we
went
and
came
into
the
full
blaze
of
that
day
which
here
knew
no
night
but
prolonged
itself
into
months
for
a
while
almah
stood
looking
forth
between
the
trees
to
where
the
bright
sunlight
sparkled
on
the
sea
and
then
with
a
sigh
she
turned
to
the
left
i
followed
on
coming
to
the
next
portal
she
went
in
i
followed
and
found
myself
in
a
rough
cavern
dark
and
forbidding
traversing
this
we
came
to
an
inner
doorway
closed
with
a
heavy
mat
this
she
raised
and
passed
through
while
i
went
in
after
her
i
found
myself
in
a
vast
cavern
full
of
dim
sparkling
lights
which
served
not
to
illuminate
it
but
merely
to
indicate
its
enormous
extent
far
above
rose
the
vaulted
roof
to
a
height
of
apparently
a
hundred
feet
under
this
there
was
a
lofty
with
stone
steps
all
around
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
the
obscure
light
there
were
niches
in
the
walls
each
one
containing
a
figure
with
a
light
burning
at
its
feet
i
took
them
for
statues
almah
pointed
in
silence
to
one
of
these
which
was
nearest
and
i
went
up
close
so
as
to
see
it
the
first
glance
that
i
took
made
me
recoil
with
horror
it
was
no
statue
that
i
saw
in
that
niche
but
a
shrivelled
human
form
a
hideous
sight
it
was
dark
and
dried
it
was
fixed
in
a
sitting
posture
with
its
hands
resting
on
its
knees
and
its
hollow
eyes
looking
forward
on
its
head
was
the
mockery
of
a
wreath
of
flowers
while
from
its
heart
there
projected
the
handle
and
half
of
the
blade
of
a
knife
which
had
been
thrust
there
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
knife
it
seemed
to
tell
of
a
violent
death
yet
the
flowers
must
surely
be
a
mark
of
honor
a
violent
death
with
honor
and
the
embalmed
remains
these
things
suggested
nothing
else
than
the
horrid
thought
of
a
human
sacrifice
i
looked
away
with
eager
and
terrible
curiosity
i
saw
all
the
niches
hundreds
upon
hundreds
all
filled
with
these
fearful
occupants
i
turned
again
with
a
sinking
heart
to
almah
her
face
was
full
of
anguish
this
is
my
duty
said
she
every
jom
i
must
come
here
and
crown
these
victims
with
fresh
flowers
a
feeling
of
sickening
horror
overwhelmed
me
almah
had
spoken
these
words
and
stood
looking
at
me
with
a
face
of
woe
this
then
was
that
daily
task
from
which
she
was
wont
to
return
in
such
sadness
an
abhorrent
task
to
her
and
one
to
which
familiarity
had
never
reconciled
her
what
was
she
doing
here
what
dark
fate
was
it
that
thus
bound
this
child
of
light
to
these
children
of
darkness
or
why
was
she
thus
compelled
to
perform
a
service
from
which
all
her
nature
revolted
i
read
in
her
face
at
this
moment
a
horror
equal
to
my
own
and
at
the
sight
of
her
distress
my
own
was
lessened
and
there
arose
within
me
a
profound
sympathy
and
a
strong
desire
to
do
something
to
alleviate
her
misery
this
is
no
place
for
you
continued
almah
go
and
i
will
soon
join
you
no
said
i
using
her
language
after
my
own
broken
fashion
no
i
will
not
go
i
will
stay
i
will
help
if
you
will
permit
she
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
seemed
to
see
that
my
resolution
was
firmly
fixed
and
that
i
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
it
very
well
said
she
if
you
do
stay
and
help
me
it
will
be
a
great
relief
with
these
simple
words
she
proceeded
to
carry
out
her
work
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramid
there
was
a
heap
of
wreaths
made
out
of
fresh
flowers
and
these
were
to
be
placed
by
her
on
the
heads
of
the
embalmed
corpses
this
work
said
she
is
considered
here
the
highest
and
most
honorable
that
can
be
performed
it
is
given
to
me
out
of
kindness
and
they
can
not
understand
that
i
can
have
any
other
feelings
in
the
performance
than
those
of
joy
and
exultation
here
among
the
dead
and
in
the
dark
i
said
nothing
but
followed
and
watched
her
carrying
the
wreaths
and
supplying
her
she
went
to
each
niche
in
succession
and
after
taking
the
wreath
off
each
corpse
she
placed
a
fresh
one
on
saying
a
brief
formula
at
each
act
by
keeping
her
supplied
with
wreaths
i
was
able
to
lighten
her
task
so
much
so
that
whereas
it
usually
occupied
her
more
than
two
hours
on
the
present
occasion
it
was
finished
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
informed
me
that
those
which
she
crowned
were
the
corpses
of
men
who
had
been
sacrificed
during
the
present
season
by
season
meaning
the
six
months
of
light
and
that
though
many
more
were
here
yet
they
wore
crowns
of
gold
at
the
end
of
ten
years
they
were
removed
to
public
sepulchres
the
number
of
those
which
had
to
be
crowned
by
her
was
about
a
hundred
her
work
was
only
to
crown
them
the
labor
of
collecting
the
flowers
and
weaving
the
wreaths
and
attending
to
the
lamps
being
performed
by
others
i
left
this
place
with
almah
sad
and
depressed
she
had
not
told
me
why
these
victims
had
been
sacrificed
nor
did
i
feel
inclined
to
ask
a
dark
suspicion
had
come
to
me
that
these
people
underneath
all
their
amiable
ways
concealed
thoughts
habits
and
motives
of
a
frightful
kind
and
that
beyond
all
my
present
brightness
and
happiness
there
might
be
a
fate
awaiting
me
too
horrible
for
thought
yet
i
did
not
wish
to
borrow
trouble
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
was
quite
enough
for
one
occasion
i
was
anxious
rather
to
forget
it
all
nor
did
almah
words
or
manner
in
any
way
reassure
me
she
was
silent
and
sad
and
preoccupied
it
was
as
though
she
knew
the
worst
and
knowing
it
dared
not
speak
as
though
there
was
something
more
horrible
which
she
dared
not
reveal
for
my
part
i
feared
it
so
that
i
dared
not
ask
it
was
enough
for
me
just
then
to
know
that
my
mild
and
and
generous
entertainers
were
addicted
to
the
abhorrent
custom
of
human
sacrifices
chapter
x
the
sacred
hunt
on
that
very
jom
the
kohen
informed
me
that
they
were
about
to
set
forth
on
the
sacred
hunt
an
event
which
always
occurred
toward
the
end
of
the
season
and
he
kindly
invited
me
to
go
i
eager
to
find
any
relief
from
the
horrible
thoughts
that
had
taken
possession
of
me
and
full
of
longing
for
active
exertion
at
once
accepted
the
invitation
i
was
delighted
to
hear
almah
say
that
she
too
was
going
and
i
learned
at
the
same
time
that
in
this
strange
land
the
women
were
as
fond
of
hunting
as
the
men
and
that
on
such
occasions
their
presence
was
expected
the
sacred
hunt
was
certainly
a
strange
one
i
saw
that
it
was
to
take
place
on
the
water
for
a
great
crowd
numbering
over
a
hundred
went
down
to
the
harbor
and
embarked
on
board
a
galley
on
which
there
were
a
hundred
others
who
served
as
rowers
the
hunters
were
all
armed
with
long
light
javelins
and
short
swords
some
of
these
were
offered
to
me
for
as
yet
no
one
supposed
that
my
rifle
and
pistol
were
instruments
of
destruction
or
anything
else
than
ornaments
my
refusal
to
accept
their
weapons
created
some
surprise
but
with
their
usual
civility
they
did
not
press
their
offers
further
it
was
evident
that
this
hunting
expedition
was
only
made
in
obedience
to
some
hallowed
custom
for
the
light
of
the
sun
pained
their
eyes
and
all
their
movements
were
made
with
uncertainty
and
hesitation
with
these
a
hunt
by
sunlight
is
the
same
as
a
hunt
by
night
would
be
with
us
there
was
the
same
confusion
and
awkwardness
the
kohen
was
in
command
at
his
word
the
galley
started
and
the
rowers
pulled
out
to
sea
with
long
regular
strokes
i
was
anxious
to
know
what
the
expedition
was
aimed
at
and
what
were
the
animals
that
we
expected
to
get
but
i
could
not
make
out
almah
explanations
her
words
suggested
something
of
vague
terror
vast
proportions
and
indescribable
ferocity
but
my
ignorance
of
the
language
prevented
me
from
learning
anything
more
we
went
along
the
coast
for
a
few
miles
and
then
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
great
river
which
seemed
to
flow
from
among
the
mountains
the
current
was
exceedingly
swift
and
as
i
looked
back
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
be
the
very
stream
which
had
borne
me
here
into
this
remote
world
i
afterward
found
out
that
this
was
so
that
this
stream
emerges
from
among
the
mountains
flowing
from
an
unknown
source
it
was
over
this
that
i
had
been
borne
in
my
sleep
after
i
had
emerged
from
the
subterranean
darkness
and
it
was
by
this
current
that
i
had
been
carried
into
the
open
sea
as
we
crossed
the
estuary
of
this
river
i
saw
that
the
shores
on
either
side
were
low
and
covered
with
the
rankest
vegetation
giant
trees
of
fern
vast
reeds
and
grasses
all
arose
here
in
a
dense
growth
impassable
to
man
upon
the
shallow
shores
the
surf
was
breaking
and
here
in
the
tide
i
saw
objects
which
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
rocks
but
afterward
found
out
to
be
living
things
they
looked
like
alligators
but
were
far
larger
than
the
largest
alligators
known
to
us
besides
being
of
far
more
terrific
aspect
toward
these
the
galley
was
directed
and
i
now
saw
with
surprise
that
these
were
the
objects
of
the
sacred
hunt
suddenly
as
the
galley
was
moving
along
at
there
arose
out
of
the
water
a
thing
that
looked
like
the
folds
of
a
giant
hairy
serpent
which
however
proved
to
be
the
long
neck
of
an
incredible
monster
whose
immense
body
soon
afterward
appeared
above
the
water
with
huge
fins
he
propelled
himself
toward
us
and
his
head
twenty
feet
in
the
air
was
poised
as
though
about
to
attack
the
head
was
like
that
of
an
alligator
the
open
jaws
showed
a
fearful
array
of
sharp
teeth
the
eyes
were
fiercely
glowing
the
long
neck
was
covered
with
a
coarse
shaggy
mane
while
the
top
of
the
body
which
was
out
of
the
water
was
incased
in
an
impenetrable
cuirass
of
bone
such
a
monster
as
this
seemed
unassailable
especially
by
men
who
had
no
missile
weapons
and
whose
eyes
were
so
dim
and
weak
i
therefore
expected
that
the
galley
would
turn
and
fly
from
the
attack
for
the
monster
itself
seemed
as
large
as
our
vessel
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
thought
of
flight
on
the
contrary
every
man
was
on
the
alert
some
sprang
to
the
bow
and
stood
there
awaiting
the
first
shock
others
amidship
stood
waiting
for
the
orders
of
the
kohen
meanwhile
the
monster
approached
and
at
length
with
a
sweep
of
his
long
neck
came
down
upon
the
dense
crowd
at
the
bows
a
dozen
frail
lances
were
broken
against
his
horny
head
a
wretches
were
seized
and
terribly
torn
by
those
remorseless
jaws
still
none
fled
all
rushed
forward
and
with
lances
axes
knives
and
ropes
they
sought
to
destroy
the
enemy
numbers
of
them
strove
to
seize
his
long
neck
in
the
ardor
of
the
fight
the
rowers
dropped
their
oars
and
hurried
to
the
scene
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
the
slaughter
was
sickening
but
not
a
man
quailed
never
had
i
dreamed
of
such
blind
and
desperate
courage
as
was
now
displayed
before
my
eyes
each
sought
to
outdo
the
other
they
had
managed
to
throw
ropes
around
the
monster
neck
by
which
he
was
held
close
to
the
galley
his
fierce
movements
seemed
likely
to
drag
us
all
down
under
the
water
and
his
long
neck
free
from
restraint
writhed
and
twisted
among
the
struggling
crowd
of
fighting
men
in
the
midst
of
whom
was
the
kohen
as
desperate
and
as
fearless
as
any
all
this
had
taken
place
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
and
i
had
scarce
been
able
to
comprehend
the
full
meaning
of
it
all
as
for
almah
she
stood
pale
and
trembling
with
a
face
of
horror
at
last
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
man
of
them
would
be
destroyed
and
that
they
were
all
throwing
their
lives
away
to
no
purpose
whatever
above
all
my
heart
was
wrung
for
the
kohen
who
was
there
in
the
midst
of
his
people
lifting
his
frail
and
puny
arm
against
the
monster
i
could
endure
inaction
no
longer
i
had
brought
my
arms
with
me
as
usual
and
now
as
the
monster
raised
his
head
i
took
aim
at
his
eye
and
fired
the
report
rang
out
in
thunder
almah
gave
a
shriek
and
amid
the
smoke
i
saw
the
long
neck
of
the
monster
sweeping
about
madly
among
the
men
in
the
water
his
vast
tail
was
lashing
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
churning
it
into
foam
here
i
once
more
took
aim
immediately
under
the
where
there
was
no
scaly
covering
once
more
i
fired
this
time
it
was
with
fatal
effect
and
after
one
or
two
convulsive
movements
the
monster
with
a
low
deep
bellow
let
his
head
fall
and
gasped
out
his
life
i
hurried
forward
there
lay
the
frightful
head
with
its
long
neck
and
shaggy
mane
while
all
around
was
a
hideous
spectacle
the
destruction
of
life
had
been
awful
nineteen
were
dead
and
were
wounded
writhing
in
every
gradation
of
agony
some
horribly
mangled
the
rest
stood
staring
at
me
in
astonishment
not
understanding
those
peals
of
thunder
that
had
laid
the
monster
low
there
was
no
terror
or
awe
however
nothing
more
than
surprise
and
the
kohen
whose
clothes
were
torn
into
shreds
and
covered
with
blood
looked
at
me
in
bewilderment
i
said
to
him
out
of
my
small
stock
of
words
that
the
wounded
ought
at
once
to
be
cared
for
at
this
he
turned
away
and
made
some
remarks
to
his
men
i
now
stood
ready
to
lend
my
own
services
if
needful
i
expected
to
take
a
part
in
the
tender
attentions
which
were
the
due
of
these
gallant
souls
who
had
exhibited
such
matchless
valor
these
men
who
thought
nothing
of
life
but
flung
it
away
at
the
command
of
their
chief
without
dreaming
of
flight
or
of
hesitation
thus
i
stood
looking
on
in
an
expectant
attitude
when
there
came
a
moment
in
which
i
was
simply
petrified
with
horror
for
the
kohen
drew
his
knife
stooped
over
the
wounded
man
nearest
him
and
then
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
with
a
mortal
wound
the
others
all
proceeded
to
do
the
same
and
they
did
it
in
the
coolest
and
most
manner
without
any
passion
without
any
feeling
of
any
kind
and
indeed
with
a
certain
air
of
gratification
as
though
they
were
performing
some
peculiarly
high
and
sacred
duty
the
mildness
and
benevolence
of
their
faces
seemed
actually
heightened
and
the
perpetration
of
this
unutterable
atrocity
seemed
to
affect
these
people
in
the
same
way
in
which
the
performance
of
acts
of
humanity
might
affect
us
for
my
own
part
i
stood
for
a
few
moments
actually
motionless
from
perplexity
and
horror
then
with
a
shriek
i
rushed
forward
as
if
to
prevent
it
but
i
was
too
late
the
unutterable
deed
was
done
and
the
unfortunate
wounded
without
an
exception
lay
dead
beside
their
slain
companions
as
for
myself
i
was
only
regarded
with
fresh
wonder
and
they
all
stood
blinking
at
me
with
their
eyes
suddenly
the
kohen
fell
prostrate
on
his
knees
before
me
and
bowing
his
head
handed
me
his
bloody
knife
said
he
give
me
also
the
blessing
of
darkness
and
death
at
these
strange
words
following
such
actions
i
could
say
nothing
i
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
and
horror
and
bewilderment
made
me
dumb
i
turned
away
and
went
aft
to
almah
who
had
seen
it
all
she
looked
at
me
with
an
anxious
gaze
as
if
to
learn
what
the
effect
of
all
this
had
been
on
me
i
could
not
speak
a
word
but
with
a
vague
sense
of
the
necessity
of
i
loaded
my
rifle
and
tried
in
vain
to
make
out
what
might
be
the
meaning
of
this
union
of
gentleness
and
kindness
with
atrocious
cruelty
meanwhile
the
men
all
went
to
work
upon
various
tasks
some
secured
lines
about
the
monster
so
as
to
tow
it
astern
others
busied
themselves
with
the
corpses
collecting
them
and
arranging
them
in
rows
at
length
we
returned
towing
the
monster
astern
i
could
not
speak
until
i
was
back
again
in
the
lighted
rooms
and
alone
with
almah
then
i
told
her
as
well
as
i
could
the
horror
that
i
felt
it
was
honor
to
those
brave
men
said
she
honor
said
i
what
to
kill
them
yes
said
she
it
is
so
with
these
people
with
them
death
is
the
highest
blessing
they
all
love
death
and
seek
after
it
to
die
for
another
is
immortal
glory
to
kill
the
wounded
was
to
show
that
they
had
died
for
others
the
wounded
wished
it
themselves
you
saw
how
they
all
sought
after
death
these
people
were
too
generous
and
to
refuse
to
kill
them
after
they
had
received
wounds
at
this
my
perplexity
grew
deeper
than
ever
for
such
an
explanation
as
this
only
served
to
make
the
mystery
greater
here
said
she
no
one
understands
what
it
is
to
fear
death
they
all
love
it
and
long
for
it
but
everyone
wishes
above
all
to
die
for
others
this
is
their
highest
blessing
to
die
a
natural
death
in
bed
is
avoided
if
possible
all
this
was
incomprehensible
tell
me
almah
i
said
you
hate
darkness
as
i
do
do
you
not
fear
death
i
fear
it
above
all
things
said
almah
to
me
it
is
the
horror
of
life
it
is
the
chief
of
terrors
so
it
is
with
me
said
i
in
my
country
we
call
death
the
king
of
terrors
here
said
almah
they
call
death
the
lord
of
joy
not
long
after
the
kohen
came
in
looking
as
quiet
as
gentle
and
as
amiable
as
ever
he
showed
some
curiosity
about
my
rifle
which
he
called
a
or
rod
of
thunder
almah
also
showed
curiosity
i
did
not
care
to
explain
the
process
of
loading
it
to
the
kohen
though
almah
had
seen
me
load
it
in
the
galley
and
i
left
him
to
suppose
that
it
was
used
in
some
mysterious
way
i
cautioned
him
not
to
handle
it
carelessly
but
found
that
this
caution
only
made
him
the
more
eager
to
handle
it
since
the
prospect
of
an
accident
found
an
irresistible
attraction
i
would
not
let
it
go
out
of
my
own
hands
however
and
the
kohen
whose
was
always
most
wonderful
to
me
at
once
checked
his
curiosity
chapter
xi
the
swamp
monster
a
few
joms
after
i
was
informed
by
the
kohen
that
there
was
to
be
another
sacred
hunt
at
first
i
felt
inclined
to
refuse
but
on
learning
that
almah
was
going
i
resolved
to
go
also
for
almah
though
generally
mistress
of
her
actions
had
nevertheless
certain
duties
to
perform
and
among
these
was
the
necessity
of
accompanying
i
did
not
yet
understand
her
position
here
nor
had
i
heard
from
her
yet
how
it
was
that
she
was
so
different
from
the
rest
of
them
that
was
all
to
be
learned
at
a
future
time
for
the
present
i
had
to
be
satisfied
with
knowing
that
she
belonged
to
a
different
nation
who
spoke
a
different
language
and
that
all
her
thoughts
and
feelings
were
totally
different
from
those
of
the
people
among
whom
she
was
living
she
loved
the
light
she
feared
death
and
she
had
never
been
able
in
the
slightest
degree
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
habits
of
these
people
this
i
could
readily
understand
for
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
they
lived
in
opposition
to
nature
itself
we
went
out
into
the
daylight
and
then
i
saw
a
sight
which
filled
me
with
amazement
i
saw
a
flock
of
birds
larger
than
even
the
opkuks
they
were
called
opmahera
they
seemed
as
tall
as
giraffes
and
their
long
legs
indicated
great
powers
of
running
their
wings
were
very
short
and
not
adapted
for
flight
they
were
very
tractable
and
were
harnessed
for
riding
in
a
peculiar
way
lines
like
reins
were
fastened
to
the
wings
and
the
driver
who
sat
close
by
the
neck
guided
the
bird
in
this
way
each
bird
carried
two
men
but
for
almah
and
me
there
was
a
bird
apiece
an
iron
prod
was
also
taken
by
each
driver
as
a
spur
i
did
not
find
out
until
afterward
how
to
drive
at
that
time
the
prospect
of
so
novel
a
ride
was
such
an
exciting
one
that
i
forgot
everything
else
the
birds
seemed
quiet
and
docile
i
took
it
for
granted
that
mine
was
well
trained
and
would
go
with
the
others
of
his
own
accord
we
all
mounted
by
means
of
a
stone
platform
which
stood
by
the
pyramid
and
soon
were
on
our
way
the
speed
was
amazing
the
fastest
at
home
is
slow
compared
with
this
it
was
as
swift
as
an
ordinary
railway
train
if
not
more
so
for
some
minutes
the
novelty
of
my
situation
took
away
all
other
thoughts
and
i
held
the
reins
in
my
hands
without
knowing
how
to
use
them
but
this
mattered
not
for
the
bird
kept
on
after
the
others
while
almah
on
her
bird
was
close
behind
me
the
pace
as
i
said
was
tremendous
yet
no
easier
motion
can
be
imagined
the
bird
bounded
along
with
immense
leaps
with
wings
outstretched
but
its
feet
touched
the
ground
so
lightly
that
the
motion
seemed
almost
equal
to
flying
we
did
not
confine
ourselves
to
the
roads
for
the
birds
were
capable
of
going
over
any
kind
of
country
in
a
straight
line
on
this
occasion
we
passed
over
wide
fields
and
rocky
mountain
ridges
and
deep
swamps
and
sand
wastes
at
the
same
speed
until
at
length
we
reached
a
vast
forest
of
dense
where
the
whole
band
stopped
for
a
short
time
after
which
we
took
up
a
new
direction
moving
on
more
slowly
the
forest
grew
up
out
of
a
swamp
which
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
from
the
sea
to
the
mountains
along
the
edge
of
this
forest
we
went
for
some
time
until
at
length
there
came
a
rushing
crackling
sound
as
of
something
moving
there
among
the
trees
crushing
down
everything
in
its
progress
we
halted
and
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
soon
not
far
away
there
emerged
from
the
thick
forest
a
figure
of
incredible
size
and
most
hideous
aspect
it
looked
like
one
of
those
fabled
dragons
such
as
may
be
seen
in
pictures
but
without
wings
it
was
nearly
a
hundred
feet
in
length
with
a
stout
body
and
a
long
tail
covered
all
over
with
impenetrable
scales
it
were
rather
longer
than
its
and
it
moved
its
huge
body
with
ease
and
rapidity
its
feet
were
armed
with
formidable
claws
but
its
head
was
most
terrific
it
was
a
vast
mass
of
bone
with
enormous
eyes
that
glared
like
fire
its
jaws
opened
to
the
width
of
six
or
eight
feet
and
were
furnished
with
rows
of
sharp
teeth
while
at
the
extremity
of
its
nose
there
was
a
tusk
several
feet
long
like
the
horn
of
a
rhinoceros
curving
backward
all
this
i
took
in
at
the
first
glance
and
the
next
instant
the
whole
band
of
hunters
with
their
usual
recklessness
flung
themselves
upon
the
monster
for
a
short
time
all
was
the
wildest
confusion
an
intermingling
of
birds
and
men
with
the
writhing
and
roaring
beast
with
his
huge
claws
and
his
curved
horn
and
his
wide
jaws
he
dealt
death
and
destruction
all
around
yet
still
the
assailants
kept
at
their
work
many
leaped
down
to
the
ground
and
rushed
close
up
to
the
monster
thrusting
their
lances
into
the
softer
and
more
unprotected
parts
of
his
body
while
others
guiding
their
birds
with
marvellous
dexterity
assailed
him
on
all
sides
the
birds
too
were
kept
well
to
their
work
nor
did
they
exhibit
any
fear
it
was
not
until
they
were
wounded
that
they
sought
to
fly
still
the
contest
seemed
too
unequal
the
sacrifice
of
life
was
horrible
i
saw
men
and
birds
literally
torn
to
pieces
before
my
eyes
nevertheless
the
utter
fearlessness
of
the
assailants
confounded
me
in
spite
of
the
slaughter
fresh
crowds
rushed
on
they
clambered
over
his
back
and
strove
to
drive
their
lances
under
his
bony
cuirass
in
the
midst
of
them
i
saw
the
kohen
by
some
means
he
had
reached
the
animal
back
and
was
crawling
along
holding
by
the
coarse
shaggy
mane
at
length
he
stopped
and
with
a
sudden
effort
thrust
his
lance
into
the
monster
eye
the
vast
beast
gave
a
low
and
terrible
howl
his
immense
tail
went
flying
all
about
in
his
pain
he
rolled
over
and
over
crushing
underneath
him
in
his
awful
struggles
all
who
were
nearest
i
could
no
longer
be
inactive
i
raised
my
rifle
and
as
the
beast
in
his
writhings
exposed
his
belly
i
took
aim
at
the
soft
flesh
just
inside
his
left
and
fired
both
barrels
at
that
instant
my
bird
gave
a
wild
shrill
scream
and
a
vast
bound
into
the
air
and
then
away
it
went
like
the
wind
away
i
know
not
where
that
first
bound
had
nearly
jerked
me
off
but
i
managed
to
avoid
this
and
now
instinctively
clung
with
all
my
might
to
the
neck
still
holding
my
rifle
the
speed
of
the
bird
was
twice
as
great
as
it
had
been
before
as
the
speed
of
a
runaway
horse
surpasses
that
of
the
same
horse
when
trotting
at
his
ordinary
rate
and
under
control
i
could
scarcely
make
out
where
i
was
going
rocks
hills
swamps
fields
trees
sand
and
sea
all
seemed
to
flash
past
in
one
confused
assemblage
and
the
only
thought
in
my
mind
was
that
i
was
being
carried
to
some
remote
wilderness
to
be
flung
there
bruised
and
maimed
among
the
rocks
to
perish
helplessly
every
moment
i
expected
to
be
thrown
for
the
progress
of
the
bird
was
not
only
inconceivably
swift
but
it
also
gave
immense
leaps
into
the
air
and
it
was
only
its
easy
mode
of
lighting
on
the
ground
after
each
leap
that
saved
me
from
being
hurled
off
as
it
was
however
i
clung
instinctively
to
the
bird
neck
until
at
last
it
came
to
a
stop
so
suddenly
that
my
hands
slipped
and
i
fell
to
the
ground
i
was
senseless
for
i
know
not
how
long
when
at
last
i
revived
i
found
myself
propped
up
against
a
bank
and
almah
bathing
my
head
with
cold
water
fortunately
i
had
received
no
hurt
in
falling
i
had
struck
on
my
head
but
it
was
against
the
soft
turf
and
though
i
was
stunned
yet
on
regaining
my
senses
no
further
inconvenience
was
experienced
the
presence
of
almah
was
soon
explained
the
report
of
the
rifle
had
startled
her
bird
also
which
had
bounded
away
in
terror
like
mine
but
almah
understood
how
to
guide
him
and
managed
to
keep
him
after
me
so
as
to
be
of
assistance
in
case
of
need
she
had
been
close
behind
all
the
time
and
had
stopped
when
i
fell
and
come
to
my
assistance
the
place
was
a
slope
looking
out
upon
an
arm
of
the
sea
and
apparently
remote
from
human
abode
the
scenery
was
exquisitely
beautiful
a
little
distance
off
we
saw
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
open
country
was
dotted
with
clumps
of
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
arm
of
the
sea
was
an
easy
declivity
covered
with
trees
of
luxuriant
foliage
and
vast
dimensions
farther
away
on
one
side
rose
the
icy
summits
of
impassable
mountains
on
the
other
side
there
extended
the
blue
expanse
of
the
boundless
sea
the
spot
where
i
lay
was
by
the
dense
foliage
of
a
tree
which
was
unlike
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
seemed
like
some
exaggerated
grass
at
our
feet
a
brook
ran
murmuring
to
the
shore
in
the
air
and
all
around
were
innumerable
birds
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
seemed
inexpressibly
sweet
and
all
the
more
so
from
the
gentle
face
of
almah
would
it
not
be
well
i
thought
to
remain
here
why
should
almah
go
back
to
her
repulsive
duties
why
should
we
return
to
those
children
of
blood
who
loved
death
and
darkness
here
we
might
pass
our
days
together
unmolested
the
genial
climate
would
afford
us
warmth
we
needed
no
shelter
except
the
trees
and
as
for
food
there
were
the
birds
of
the
air
in
innumerable
flocks
i
proposed
this
to
her
she
smiled
sadly
you
forget
said
she
this
season
of
light
will
not
last
much
longer
in
a
few
more
joms
the
dark
season
will
begin
and
then
we
should
perish
in
a
place
like
this
are
there
no
caverns
here
oh
no
this
country
has
no
inhabitants
it
is
full
of
fierce
wild
beasts
we
should
be
destroyed
before
one
jom
but
must
we
go
back
said
i
you
have
a
country
where
is
it
see
here
are
these
birds
they
are
swift
they
can
carry
us
anywhere
come
let
us
fly
and
you
can
return
to
your
own
country
almah
shook
her
head
these
birds
said
she
can
not
go
over
the
sea
or
through
these
endless
forests
my
country
can
only
be
reached
by
sea
can
we
not
hurry
back
seize
a
boat
and
go
i
know
how
to
sail
over
the
water
without
oars
we
certainly
might
leave
the
country
but
there
is
another
difficulty
the
dark
season
is
coming
and
we
should
never
be
able
to
find
our
way
besides
the
sea
is
full
of
monsters
and
you
and
i
would
perish
at
any
rate
let
us
try
i
have
my
we
could
never
find
our
way
only
tell
me
said
i
where
it
lies
and
i
will
go
by
the
stars
the
trouble
is
said
she
that
even
if
we
did
succeed
in
reaching
my
land
i
should
be
sent
back
again
for
i
was
sent
here
as
a
sacred
hostage
and
i
have
been
here
four
seasons
but
in
the
midst
of
this
conversation
a
sound
arrested
our
attention
heavy
puffing
snorting
sound
as
of
some
living
thing
hastily
i
started
up
rifle
in
hand
and
looked
and
as
i
looked
i
felt
my
nerves
thrill
with
horror
there
close
by
the
shore
i
saw
a
vast
form
a
living
thing
full
sixty
feet
in
length
it
had
a
body
like
that
of
an
elephant
the
head
of
a
crocodile
and
enormous
glaring
eyes
its
immense
body
was
covered
with
impenetrable
armor
and
was
supported
on
legs
long
enough
to
allow
it
to
run
with
great
speed
it
differed
in
many
respects
from
the
monster
of
the
swamp
the
legs
being
longer
the
tail
shorter
and
thinner
and
its
head
and
jaws
larger
and
longer
i
shrank
back
thinking
of
seizing
almah
and
hiding
but
i
saw
that
she
had
already
taken
the
alarm
and
with
more
presence
of
mind
than
i
had
she
had
hurried
to
the
birds
who
were
standing
near
and
had
made
them
lie
down
as
i
turned
she
beckoned
to
me
without
a
word
i
hurried
to
her
she
told
me
to
mount
i
did
so
at
once
she
did
the
same
scarce
had
we
mounted
than
the
monster
perceived
us
and
with
a
terrible
bellow
came
rushing
toward
us
almah
drove
her
goad
deep
into
her
bird
which
at
once
rose
and
went
off
like
the
wind
and
mine
started
to
follow
the
vast
monster
came
on
his
roar
sounded
close
behind
and
i
heard
the
clash
of
his
tremendous
jaws
but
the
swift
bird
with
a
bound
snatched
me
from
his
grasp
and
bore
me
far
away
out
of
his
reach
away
i
went
like
the
wind
almah
was
ahead
looking
back
from
time
to
time
and
waving
her
hand
joyously
so
we
went
on
returning
on
our
course
at
a
speed
almost
as
great
as
that
with
which
we
had
come
by
this
time
the
novelty
had
in
part
worn
away
and
the
easy
motion
gave
me
confidence
i
noticed
that
we
were
travelling
a
wild
uninhabited
and
rocky
district
by
the
before
me
the
country
spread
far
away
interspersed
with
groves
terminating
in
forests
and
bounded
in
the
far
distance
by
mountains
the
country
here
was
so
rough
that
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
pass
over
it
except
such
creatures
as
these
the
opmaheras
at
length
we
arrived
at
the
spot
which
we
had
left
the
scene
of
the
hunt
we
could
see
it
from
afar
for
the
opmaheras
stood
quietly
around
and
the
men
were
busy
elsewhere
as
we
drew
nearer
i
saw
the
vast
body
of
the
monster
they
had
succeeded
in
killing
it
yet
oh
heavens
at
what
a
cost
one
half
of
all
the
party
lay
dead
the
rest
were
unharmed
and
among
these
was
the
kohen
he
greeted
me
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
melancholy
smile
however
was
not
caused
by
the
sad
fate
of
his
brave
companions
but
as
i
afterward
learned
simply
and
solely
because
he
himself
had
not
gained
his
death
when
i
saw
that
there
were
no
wounded
a
dark
suspicion
came
over
me
that
the
wounded
had
again
been
put
to
death
i
did
not
care
to
ask
the
truth
was
too
terrible
to
hear
and
i
felt
glad
that
accident
had
drawn
me
away
it
was
all
a
dark
and
dreadful
mystery
these
people
were
the
most
gentle
the
most
and
the
most
generous
in
the
world
yet
their
strange
and
unnatural
love
of
death
made
them
capable
of
endless
atrocities
life
and
light
seemed
to
them
as
actual
evils
and
death
and
darkness
the
only
things
worthy
of
regard
almah
told
me
that
they
were
going
to
bring
the
monster
home
and
had
sent
for
opkuks
to
drag
it
along
the
dead
were
also
to
be
fetched
back
there
was
no
further
necessity
for
us
to
remain
and
so
we
returned
at
once
on
the
way
almah
said
do
not
use
the
again
you
can
do
no
good
with
it
you
must
not
make
it
common
keep
it
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
need
it
you
are
not
fond
of
death
i
shuddered
never
forget
she
said
that
here
death
is
considered
the
chief
blessing
it
is
useless
for
you
to
interfere
in
their
ways
you
can
not
change
them
some
more
joms
passed
the
bodies
were
embalmed
and
almah
had
more
victims
to
crown
with
garlands
in
the
horrible
cheder
nebilin
chapter
xii
the
baleful
sacrifice
i
resolved
to
go
on
no
more
sacred
hunts
i
was
sickened
at
the
horrible
cruelty
the
needless
slaughter
the
mad
which
distinguished
them
i
was
overwhelmed
with
horror
at
the
merciless
destruction
of
brave
comrades
whose
wounds
so
gallantly
received
should
have
been
enough
to
inspire
pity
even
in
a
heart
of
stone
the
gentleness
the
incessant
kindness
the
matchless
generosity
of
these
people
seemed
all
a
mockery
what
availed
it
all
when
the
same
hand
that
heaped
favors
upon
me
the
guest
could
deal
death
without
compunction
upon
friends
and
relatives
it
seemed
quite
possible
for
the
kohen
to
kill
his
own
child
or
cut
the
throat
of
his
wife
if
the
humor
seized
him
and
how
long
could
i
hope
to
be
spared
among
a
people
who
had
this
insane
thirst
for
blood
some
more
joms
had
passed
and
the
light
season
had
almost
ended
the
sun
had
been
sinking
lower
and
lower
the
time
had
at
last
come
when
only
a
portion
of
his
disk
would
be
visible
for
a
little
while
above
the
hills
and
then
he
would
be
seen
no
more
for
six
months
of
our
time
this
was
the
dark
season
and
as
i
had
already
learned
its
advent
was
always
hailed
with
joy
and
celebrated
with
solemn
services
for
the
dark
season
freed
them
from
their
long
confinement
permitted
them
to
go
abroad
to
travel
by
sea
and
land
to
carry
on
their
great
works
to
indulge
in
all
their
most
important
labors
and
favorite
amusements
the
kohen
asked
me
to
be
present
at
the
great
festival
and
i
gladly
consented
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
in
this
that
could
be
repellent
as
i
was
anxious
to
witness
some
of
their
purely
religious
ceremonies
i
wished
to
go
when
i
told
almah
she
looked
sad
but
said
nothing
i
wondered
at
this
and
asked
her
if
she
was
going
she
informed
me
that
she
would
have
to
go
whereupon
i
assured
her
that
this
was
an
additional
reason
why
i
should
go
i
went
with
almah
the
kohen
attended
us
with
his
usual
kind
and
gracious
consideration
it
seemed
almost
as
though
he
was
our
servant
he
took
us
to
a
place
where
we
could
be
seated
although
all
the
others
were
standing
almah
wished
to
refuse
but
i
prevailed
upon
her
to
sit
down
and
she
did
so
the
scene
was
upon
the
semicircular
terrace
in
front
of
the
cavern
and
we
were
seated
upon
a
stone
platform
beside
the
chief
portal
a
vast
crowd
was
gathered
in
front
before
us
arose
the
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
the
light
was
faint
it
came
from
the
disk
of
the
sun
which
was
partly
visible
over
the
icy
crest
of
the
distant
mountains
far
away
the
sea
was
visible
rising
high
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
while
overhead
the
brighter
stars
were
plainly
discernible
the
kohen
ascended
the
pyramid
and
others
followed
at
the
base
there
was
a
crowd
of
men
with
emaciated
forms
and
faces
and
coarse
squalid
attire
who
looked
like
the
most
abject
paupers
and
seemed
the
lowest
in
the
land
as
the
kohen
reached
the
summit
there
arose
a
strange
sound
a
mournful
plaintive
chant
which
seemed
to
be
sung
chiefly
by
the
paupers
at
the
base
of
the
pyramid
the
words
of
this
chant
i
could
not
make
out
but
the
melancholy
strain
affected
me
in
spite
of
myself
there
was
no
particular
tune
and
nothing
like
harmony
but
the
effect
of
so
many
voices
uniting
in
this
strain
was
very
powerful
and
altogether
indescribable
in
the
midst
of
this
i
saw
the
crowd
parting
asunder
so
as
to
make
way
for
something
and
through
the
passage
thus
formed
i
saw
a
number
of
youths
in
long
robes
who
advanced
to
the
pyramid
singing
as
they
went
then
they
ascended
the
steps
two
by
two
still
singing
and
at
length
reached
the
summit
where
they
arranged
themselves
in
order
there
were
thirty
of
them
and
they
arranged
themselves
in
three
rows
of
ten
each
and
as
they
stood
they
never
ceased
to
sing
while
the
paupers
below
joined
in
the
strain
and
now
the
sun
was
almost
hidden
and
there
was
only
the
faintest
line
from
the
upper
edge
of
his
disk
perceptible
over
the
icy
the
light
was
a
softened
twilight
glow
it
was
to
be
the
last
sight
of
the
sun
for
six
months
and
this
was
the
spectacle
upon
which
he
threw
his
parting
beam
so
the
sun
passed
away
and
then
there
came
the
beginning
of
the
long
dark
season
at
first
however
there
was
rather
twilight
than
darkness
and
this
twilight
continued
long
all
this
only
served
to
heighten
the
effect
of
this
striking
scene
and
as
the
light
faded
away
i
looked
with
increasing
curiosity
upon
the
group
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
almah
was
silent
i
half
turned
and
said
something
to
her
about
the
beauty
of
the
view
she
said
nothing
but
looked
at
me
with
such
an
expression
that
i
was
filled
with
amazement
i
saw
in
her
face
something
like
a
dreadful
anticipation
something
that
spoke
of
coming
evil
the
feeling
was
communicated
to
me
and
i
turned
my
eyes
back
to
the
group
on
the
pyramid
with
vague
fears
in
my
soul
those
fears
were
but
too
well
founded
for
now
the
dread
ceremony
began
the
kohen
drew
his
knife
and
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
stone
table
one
of
the
youths
came
forward
stepped
upon
it
and
lay
down
on
his
back
with
his
head
toward
the
kohen
the
mournful
chant
still
went
on
then
the
kohen
raised
his
knife
and
plunged
it
into
the
heart
of
the
youth
i
sat
for
a
moment
rooted
to
the
spot
then
a
groan
burst
from
me
in
spite
of
myself
almah
caught
my
hands
in
hers
which
were
as
cold
as
ice
be
firm
she
said
or
we
are
both
lost
be
firm
i
must
go
said
i
and
i
tried
to
rise
do
move
she
said
for
your
life
we
are
lost
if
you
move
keep
still
restrain
yourself
shut
your
eyes
i
tried
to
do
so
but
could
not
there
was
a
horrible
fascination
about
the
scene
which
forced
me
to
look
and
see
all
the
kohen
took
the
victim
and
drawing
it
from
the
altar
threw
it
over
the
precipice
to
the
ground
beneath
then
a
loud
shout
burst
forth
from
the
great
crowd
sibgu
sibgin
ranenu
hodu
lecosck
which
means
sacrifice
the
victims
rejoice
give
thanks
to
darkness
then
another
of
the
youths
went
forward
amid
the
singing
and
laid
himself
down
to
meet
the
same
fate
and
again
the
corpse
was
flung
from
the
top
of
the
pyramid
and
again
the
shout
arose
all
the
others
came
forward
in
the
same
manner
oh
horrible
horrible
thrice
horrible
spectacle
i
do
not
remember
how
i
endured
it
i
sat
there
with
almah
trying
to
restrain
myself
as
she
had
entreated
me
more
for
her
sake
than
for
my
own
a
prey
to
every
feeling
of
horror
anguish
and
despair
how
it
all
ended
i
do
not
know
nor
do
i
know
how
i
got
away
from
the
place
for
i
only
remember
coming
back
to
my
senses
in
the
lighted
grotto
with
almah
bending
anxiously
over
me
after
this
there
remained
a
dark
mystery
and
an
horror
i
found
myself
among
a
people
who
were
at
once
the
gentlest
of
the
human
race
and
the
most
the
kindest
and
the
most
cruel
this
mild
amiable
and
kohen
how
was
it
possible
that
he
should
transform
himself
to
a
fiend
incarnate
and
for
me
and
for
almah
what
possible
hope
could
there
be
what
fate
might
they
have
in
reserve
for
us
of
what
avail
was
all
this
profound
respect
this
incessant
desire
to
please
this
attention
to
our
slightest
wish
this
comfort
and
luxury
and
splendor
this
freedom
of
speech
and
action
was
it
anything
better
than
a
mockery
might
it
not
be
the
shallow
kindness
of
the
priest
to
the
victim
reserved
for
the
sacrifice
was
it
after
all
in
any
degree
better
than
the
kindness
of
the
cannibal
savages
on
those
drear
outer
shores
who
received
us
with
such
hospitality
but
only
that
they
might
destroy
us
at
last
might
they
not
all
belong
to
the
same
race
dwelling
as
they
did
in
caverns
shunning
the
sunlight
and
blending
kindness
with
cruelty
it
was
an
awful
thought
yet
i
had
one
consolation
almah
was
with
me
and
so
long
as
she
was
spared
to
me
i
could
endure
this
life
i
tried
for
her
sake
to
resist
the
feelings
that
were
coming
over
me
i
saw
that
she
too
was
a
prey
to
sadness
she
felt
as
i
did
and
this
despair
of
soul
might
wreck
her
young
life
if
there
were
no
alleviation
and
so
i
sought
to
alleviate
her
distress
and
to
banish
her
sadness
the
songs
of
these
people
had
much
impressed
me
and
one
day
as
i
talked
about
this
with
almah
she
brought
forth
a
musical
instrument
of
peculiar
shape
which
was
not
unlike
a
guitar
though
the
shape
was
square
and
there
were
a
dozen
strings
upon
this
she
played
singing
at
the
same
time
some
songs
of
a
plaintive
character
an
idea
now
occurred
to
me
to
have
an
instrument
made
according
to
my
own
plans
which
should
be
nothing
less
than
a
violin
almah
was
delighted
at
the
proposal
and
at
once
found
a
very
clever
workman
who
under
my
direction
succeeded
in
producing
one
which
served
my
purpose
well
i
was
a
good
violinist
and
in
this
i
was
able
to
find
solace
for
myself
and
for
almah
for
many
a
long
hour
the
first
time
that
i
played
was
memorable
as
the
tones
floated
through
the
air
they
caught
the
ears
of
those
outside
and
soon
great
numbers
came
into
the
apartment
listening
in
amazement
and
in
rapt
attention
even
the
painful
light
was
disregarded
in
the
pleasure
of
this
most
novel
sensation
and
i
perceived
that
if
the
sense
of
sight
was
deficient
among
them
that
of
hearing
was
sufficiently
acute
i
played
many
times
and
sometimes
sang
from
among
the
songs
of
different
nations
but
those
which
these
people
liked
best
were
the
irish
and
scottish
melodies
those
matchless
strains
created
by
the
genius
of
the
celtic
race
and
handed
down
from
immemorial
ages
through
long
generations
in
these
there
was
nothing
artificial
nothing
transient
they
were
the
utterance
of
the
human
heart
and
in
them
there
was
that
touch
of
nature
which
makes
all
men
kin
these
were
the
immortal
passions
which
shall
never
cease
to
affect
the
soul
of
man
and
which
had
power
even
here
the
strains
of
love
of
sadness
and
of
pathos
were
sweet
and
enticing
to
this
gentle
race
for
in
their
mild
manners
and
their
outburst
of
cruelty
they
seemed
to
be
not
unlike
the
very
race
which
had
created
this
music
since
the
celt
is
at
once
gentle
and
i
played
tara
bonnie
doon
the
last
rose
of
summer
the
land
of
the
leal
auld
lang
syne
lochaber
they
stood
entranced
listening
with
all
their
souls
they
seemed
to
hunger
and
thirst
after
this
music
and
the
strains
of
the
inspired
celtic
race
seemed
to
come
to
them
like
the
revelation
of
the
glory
of
heaven
then
i
played
more
lively
airs
some
i
played
a
second
time
singing
the
words
they
seemed
eager
to
have
the
same
one
played
often
at
last
a
grisly
thought
came
to
me
it
was
that
they
would
learn
these
sweet
strains
and
put
their
own
words
to
them
so
as
to
use
them
at
the
awful
sacrifices
after
that
i
would
play
no
more
it
is
a
land
of
tender
love
and
remorseless
cruelty
music
is
to
awaken
the
one
but
powerless
to
abate
the
other
and
the
eyes
that
weep
over
the
pathetic
strains
of
lochaber
can
gaze
without
a
tear
upon
the
of
a
slaughtered
friend
chapter
xiii
the
awful
mista
kosek
the
terrible
sacrifice
marked
the
end
of
the
light
season
the
dark
season
had
now
begun
which
would
last
for
half
the
coming
year
no
more
sunlight
would
now
be
visible
save
at
first
for
a
few
joms
when
at
certain
times
the
glare
would
be
seen
shooting
up
above
the
icy
crests
of
the
mountains
now
the
people
all
moved
out
of
the
caverns
into
the
stone
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
terraces
and
the
busy
throng
transferred
themselves
and
their
occupations
to
the
open
air
this
with
them
was
the
season
of
activity
when
all
their
most
important
affairs
were
undertaken
and
carried
out
the
season
too
of
enjoyment
when
all
the
chief
sports
and
festivals
took
place
then
the
outer
world
all
awoke
to
life
the
streets
were
thronged
fleets
of
galleys
came
forth
from
their
moorings
and
the
sounds
of
labor
and
of
pleasure
of
toil
and
revelry
arose
into
the
darkened
skies
then
the
city
was
a
city
of
the
living
no
longer
silent
but
full
of
bustle
and
the
caverns
were
frequented
but
little
this
cavern
life
was
only
tolerable
during
the
light
season
when
the
was
over
the
land
but
now
when
the
beneficent
and
grateful
darkness
pervaded
all
things
the
outer
world
was
infinitely
more
agreeable
to
me
however
the
arrival
of
the
dark
season
brought
only
additional
gloom
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
thought
that
i
was
reserved
for
some
horrible
fate
in
which
almah
might
also
be
involved
we
were
both
aliens
here
in
a
nation
of
and
amiable
miscreants
of
generous
refined
and
most
fiends
of
men
who
were
highly
civilized
yet
utterly
and
irreclaimable
in
their
cruelty
the
stain
of
was
over
all
the
land
what
was
i
that
i
could
hope
to
be
spared
the
hope
was
madness
and
i
did
not
pretend
to
indulge
it
the
only
consolation
was
almah
the
manners
of
these
people
were
such
that
we
were
still
left
as
unconstrained
as
ever
in
our
movements
and
always
wherever
we
went
we
encountered
nothing
but
amiable
smiles
and
courteous
offices
everyone
was
always
eager
to
do
anything
for
us
to
give
to
go
to
act
to
speak
as
though
we
were
the
most
honored
of
guests
the
pride
of
the
city
the
kohen
was
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
please
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
presents
every
time
he
came
to
see
me
and
on
each
occasion
the
present
was
of
a
different
kind
at
one
time
it
was
a
new
robe
of
curiously
wrought
feathers
at
another
some
beautiful
gem
at
another
some
rare
fruit
he
also
made
incessant
efforts
to
render
my
situation
pleasant
and
was
delighted
at
my
rapid
progress
in
acquiring
the
language
on
the
jom
following
the
sacrifice
i
accompanied
almah
as
she
went
to
her
daily
task
and
after
it
was
over
i
asked
when
the
new
victims
would
be
placed
here
how
long
does
it
take
to
embalm
them
i
added
almah
looked
at
me
earnestly
they
will
not
bring
them
here
they
will
not
embalm
them
said
she
why
not
i
asked
what
will
they
do
with
them
do
not
ask
said
she
it
will
pain
you
to
know
in
spite
of
repeated
solicitation
she
refused
to
give
me
any
satisfaction
i
felt
deeply
moved
at
her
words
and
her
looks
what
was
it
i
wondered
that
could
give
me
pain
or
what
could
there
still
be
that
could
excite
fear
in
me
who
had
learned
and
seen
so
much
i
could
not
imagine
it
was
evidently
some
disposal
of
the
bodies
of
the
victims
that
was
plain
turning
this
over
in
my
mind
with
vague
conjectures
as
to
almah
meaning
i
left
her
and
walked
along
the
terrace
until
i
came
to
the
next
cavern
this
had
never
been
open
before
and
i
now
entered
through
curiosity
to
see
what
it
might
be
i
saw
a
vast
cavern
quite
as
large
as
the
cheder
nebilin
full
of
people
who
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
decorating
it
hundreds
were
at
work
and
they
had
brought
immense
which
were
placed
on
either
side
in
long
rows
with
their
branches
meeting
and
interlacing
at
the
top
it
looked
like
the
interior
of
some
great
gothic
cathedral
at
night
and
the
few
twinkling
lights
that
were
scattered
here
and
there
made
the
shadowy
outline
just
visible
to
me
i
asked
one
of
the
bystanders
what
this
might
be
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
the
mista
kosek
which
means
the
feast
of
darkness
from
which
i
gathered
that
they
were
about
to
celebrate
the
advent
of
the
dark
season
with
a
feast
from
what
i
knew
of
their
character
this
seemed
quite
intelligible
and
there
was
much
beauty
and
taste
in
the
arrangements
all
were
industrious
and
orderly
and
each
one
seemed
most
eager
to
assist
his
neighbor
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
a
friendly
rivalry
in
this
which
at
times
amounted
to
positive
violence
for
more
than
once
when
a
man
was
seen
carrying
too
large
a
burden
someone
else
would
insist
on
taking
it
from
him
at
first
these
altercations
seemed
exactly
like
the
quarrels
of
workmen
at
home
but
a
closer
inspection
showed
that
it
was
merely
the
persistent
effort
of
one
to
help
another
i
learned
that
the
feast
was
to
take
place
as
soon
as
the
hall
was
decorated
and
that
it
would
be
attended
by
a
great
multitude
i
felt
a
great
interest
in
it
there
seemed
something
of
poetic
beauty
in
this
mode
of
welcoming
the
advent
of
a
welcome
season
and
it
served
to
mitigate
the
horrible
remembrance
of
that
other
celebration
upon
which
i
could
not
think
without
a
shudder
i
thought
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
join
with
them
here
and
resolved
to
ask
almah
to
come
with
me
so
that
she
might
explain
the
meaning
of
the
ceremonies
full
of
this
thought
i
went
to
her
and
told
her
my
wish
she
looked
at
me
with
a
face
full
of
amazement
and
misery
in
great
surprise
i
questioned
her
eagerly
ask
me
nothing
said
she
i
will
answer
nothing
but
do
not
think
of
it
do
not
go
near
it
stay
in
your
room
till
the
fearful
repast
is
over
fearful
how
is
it
fearful
i
asked
everything
here
is
fearful
said
almah
with
a
sigh
every
season
it
grows
worse
and
i
shall
grow
at
length
to
hate
life
and
love
death
as
these
people
do
they
can
never
understand
us
and
we
can
never
understand
them
oh
if
i
could
but
once
more
stand
in
my
own
dear
native
land
but
for
one
moment
to
see
once
more
the
scenes
and
the
faces
that
i
love
so
well
oh
how
different
is
this
land
from
mine
here
all
is
dark
all
is
terrible
there
the
people
love
the
light
and
rejoice
in
the
glorious
sun
and
when
the
dark
season
comes
they
wait
and
have
no
other
desire
than
long
day
there
we
live
under
the
sky
in
the
eye
of
the
sun
we
build
our
houses
and
when
the
dark
season
comes
we
fill
them
with
lamps
that
make
a
blaze
like
the
sun
itself
we
must
try
to
escape
i
said
in
a
low
voice
escape
said
she
that
is
easy
enough
we
might
go
now
but
where
back
said
i
to
your
own
country
see
the
sky
is
dotted
with
stars
i
can
find
my
way
by
them
yes
said
she
if
i
could
only
tell
you
where
to
go
but
i
can
not
my
country
lies
somewhere
over
the
sea
but
where
i
know
not
over
the
sea
there
are
many
lands
and
we
might
reach
one
even
worse
than
this
perhaps
said
i
the
kohen
might
allow
us
to
go
away
to
your
country
and
send
us
there
he
is
most
generous
and
most
amiable
he
seems
to
spend
most
of
his
time
in
efforts
to
make
us
happy
there
must
be
many
seamen
in
this
nation
who
know
the
way
it
would
be
worth
trying
almah
shook
her
head
you
do
not
understand
these
people
said
she
their
ruling
passion
is
the
hatred
of
self
and
therefore
they
are
eager
to
confer
benefits
on
others
the
only
hope
of
life
that
i
have
for
you
and
for
myself
is
in
this
that
if
they
kill
us
they
will
lose
their
most
agreeable
occupation
they
value
us
most
highly
because
we
take
everything
that
is
given
us
you
and
i
now
possess
as
our
own
property
all
this
city
and
all
its
buildings
and
all
the
people
have
made
themselves
our
slaves
at
this
i
was
utterly
bewildered
i
do
understand
said
i
i
suppose
not
said
almah
but
you
will
understand
better
after
you
have
been
here
longer
at
any
rate
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
ruling
passion
here
is
and
the
good
of
others
everyone
is
intent
upon
this
from
the
kohen
up
to
the
most
squalid
pauper
to
the
most
squalid
pauper
said
i
i
do
not
understand
you
you
mean
to
the
most
squalid
pauper
no
said
almah
i
mean
what
i
say
in
this
country
the
paupers
form
the
most
honored
and
envied
class
this
is
beyond
my
comprehension
said
i
but
if
this
is
really
so
and
if
these
people
pretend
to
be
our
slaves
why
may
we
not
order
out
a
galley
and
go
oh
well
with
you
in
your
land
if
a
master
were
to
order
his
slaves
to
cut
his
throat
and
poison
his
children
and
burn
his
house
would
the
slaves
obey
certainly
not
well
our
slaves
here
would
not
in
fact
could
not
obey
a
command
that
would
be
shocking
to
their
natures
they
think
that
we
are
in
the
best
of
all
lands
and
my
request
to
be
sent
home
would
be
utterly
monstrous
i
suppose
said
i
they
would
kill
us
if
we
asked
them
to
do
so
yes
said
almah
for
they
think
death
the
greatest
blessing
and
if
at
the
point
of
death
we
should
beg
for
life
would
they
spare
us
certainly
not
said
almah
would
you
kill
a
man
who
asked
for
death
no
more
would
these
people
spare
a
man
who
asked
for
life
all
this
was
so
utterly
incomprehensible
that
i
could
pursue
the
subject
no
further
i
saw
however
that
almah
was
wretched
dejected
and
suffering
greatly
from
gladly
would
i
have
taken
her
and
started
off
on
a
desperate
flight
by
sea
or
land
gladly
would
i
have
dared
every
peril
although
i
well
knew
what
tremendous
perils
there
were
but
she
would
not
consent
and
believed
the
attempt
to
be
useless
i
could
only
wait
therefore
and
indulge
the
hope
that
at
last
a
chance
of
escape
might
one
day
come
of
which
she
would
be
willing
to
avail
herself
almah
utterly
refused
to
go
to
the
feast
and
entreated
me
not
to
go
but
this
only
served
to
increase
my
curiosity
and
i
determined
to
see
it
for
myself
whatever
it
was
she
had
seen
it
and
why
should
not
i
whatever
it
might
be
my
nerves
could
surely
stand
the
shock
as
well
as
hers
besides
i
was
anxious
to
know
the
very
worst
and
if
there
was
anything
that
could
surpass
in
atrocity
what
i
had
already
witnessed
it
were
better
that
i
should
not
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
so
at
length
leaving
almah
i
returned
to
the
hall
of
the
feast
i
found
there
a
vast
multitude
which
seemed
to
comprise
the
whole
city
men
women
children
all
were
there
long
tables
were
laid
out
the
people
were
all
standing
an
waiting
a
choir
was
singing
plaintive
strains
that
sounded
like
the
chant
of
the
sacrifice
those
nearest
me
regarded
me
with
their
usual
amiable
smiles
and
wished
to
conduct
me
to
some
place
of
honor
but
i
did
not
care
about
taking
part
in
this
feast
i
wished
to
be
a
mere
spectator
nothing
more
i
walked
past
and
came
to
the
next
cavern
this
seemed
to
be
quite
as
large
as
the
other
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
here
also
and
at
one
end
there
blazed
an
enormous
fire
it
was
a
furnace
that
seemed
to
be
used
for
cooking
the
food
of
this
banquet
and
there
was
a
thick
steam
rising
from
an
immense
cauldron
while
the
air
was
filled
with
an
odor
like
that
of
a
kitchen
all
this
i
took
in
at
a
glance
and
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
something
else
there
were
several
very
long
tables
which
stood
at
the
sides
of
the
cavern
and
in
the
middle
and
upon
each
of
these
i
saw
lying
certain
things
covered
over
with
cloths
the
shape
of
these
was
more
than
suggestive
it
told
me
all
it
was
a
sight
of
horror
awful
tremendous
unspeakable
for
a
moment
i
stood
motionless
staring
then
all
the
cavern
seemed
to
swim
around
me
i
reeled
i
fell
and
sank
into
nothingness
when
i
revived
i
was
in
the
lighted
grotto
lying
on
a
couch
with
almah
bending
over
me
her
face
was
full
of
tenderest
anxiety
yet
there
was
also
apparent
a
certain
solemn
gloom
that
well
accorded
with
my
own
feelings
as
i
looked
at
her
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
after
a
time
my
recollection
returned
and
all
came
back
to
me
i
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
do
not
rise
yet
said
almah
anxiously
you
are
weak
no
said
i
i
am
as
strong
as
ever
but
i
afraid
that
you
are
weaker
almah
shuddered
if
you
had
told
me
exactly
what
it
was
i
would
not
have
gone
i
could
not
tell
you
said
she
it
is
too
terrible
to
name
even
the
thought
is
intolerable
i
told
you
not
to
go
why
did
you
go
she
spoke
in
accents
of
tender
reproach
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
did
not
think
of
anything
so
hideous
as
that
said
i
i
thought
that
there
might
be
a
sacrifice
but
nothing
worse
i
now
learned
that
when
i
fainted
i
had
been
raised
most
tenderly
and
the
kohen
himself
came
with
me
as
i
was
carried
back
and
he
thought
that
almah
would
be
my
most
agreeable
nurse
the
kohen
was
most
kind
and
sympathetic
and
all
the
people
vied
with
one
another
in
their
efforts
to
assist
me
so
much
so
that
there
was
the
greatest
confusion
it
was
only
by
almah
express
entreaty
that
they
retired
and
left
me
with
her
here
was
a
new
phase
in
the
character
of
this
mysterious
people
could
i
ever
hope
to
understand
them
where
other
people
are
cruel
to
strangers
or
at
best
indifferent
these
are
eager
in
their
acts
of
kindness
they
exhibit
the
most
unbounded
hospitality
the
most
lavish
generosity
the
most
care
and
attention
where
others
would
be
offended
at
the
intrusion
of
a
stranger
and
enraged
at
his
unconquerable
disgust
these
people
had
no
feeling
save
pity
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
alleviate
his
distress
and
yet
oh
and
yet
oh
thought
of
horror
what
was
this
that
i
had
seen
the
abhorrent
savages
in
the
outer
wilderness
were
surely
of
the
same
race
as
these
they
too
received
us
kindly
they
too
lavished
upon
us
their
hospitality
and
yet
there
followed
the
horror
of
that
frightful
repast
here
there
had
been
kindness
and
generosity
and
affectionate
attention
to
be
succeeded
by
deeds
without
a
name
ah
me
what
an
hour
that
was
and
yet
it
was
as
nothing
compared
to
what
lay
before
me
in
the
future
but
the
subject
was
one
of
which
i
dared
not
speak
one
from
which
i
had
to
force
my
thoughts
away
i
took
the
violin
and
played
lochaber
till
almah
wept
and
i
had
to
put
it
away
then
i
begged
her
to
play
or
sing
she
brought
an
instrument
like
a
lute
and
upon
this
she
played
some
melancholy
strains
at
length
the
kohen
came
in
his
mild
benevolent
face
never
exhibited
more
gentle
and
affectionate
sympathy
than
now
he
seated
himself
and
with
eyes
half
closed
as
usual
talked
much
and
yet
with
a
native
delicacy
which
always
distinguished
this
extraordinary
man
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
awful
mista
kosek
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
speak
i
was
overwhelmed
with
gloom
and
despair
and
at
the
same
time
full
of
aversion
toward
him
and
all
his
race
one
question
however
i
had
to
put
who
were
the
victims
of
the
mista
kosek
they
said
he
with
an
agreeable
smile
oh
they
were
the
victims
of
the
sacrifice
i
sank
back
in
my
seat
and
said
no
more
the
kohen
then
took
lute
played
and
sang
in
a
very
sweet
voice
and
at
length
with
his
usual
consideration
seeing
that
i
looked
weary
he
retired
chapter
xiv
i
learn
my
doom
horror
is
a
feeling
that
can
not
last
long
human
nature
is
incapable
of
supporting
it
sadness
whether
from
bereavement
or
disappointment
or
misfortune
of
any
kind
may
linger
on
through
life
in
my
case
however
the
milder
and
more
enduring
feeling
of
sadness
had
no
sufficient
cause
for
existence
the
sights
which
i
had
seen
inspired
horror
and
horror
only
but
when
the
first
rush
of
this
feeling
had
passed
there
came
a
reaction
calmness
followed
and
then
all
the
circumstances
of
my
life
here
conspired
to
perpetuate
that
calm
for
here
all
on
the
surface
was
pleasant
and
beautiful
all
the
people
were
amiable
and
courteous
and
most
generous
i
had
light
and
luxury
and
amusements
around
me
there
were
thousands
of
faces
all
greeting
me
with
cordial
affection
and
thousands
of
hands
all
ready
to
perform
my
slightest
wish
above
all
there
was
almah
everything
combined
to
make
her
most
dear
to
me
my
life
had
been
such
that
i
never
before
had
seen
anyone
whom
i
loved
and
here
almah
was
the
one
congenial
associate
in
a
whole
world
of
aliens
she
was
beautiful
and
gentle
and
sympathetic
and
i
loved
her
dearly
even
before
i
understood
what
my
feelings
were
one
day
i
learned
all
and
found
that
she
was
more
precious
to
me
than
all
the
world
it
was
one
jom
when
she
did
not
make
her
appearance
as
usual
on
asking
after
her
i
learned
that
she
was
at
this
intelligence
there
came
over
me
a
feeling
of
sickening
anxiety
and
fear
almah
ill
what
if
it
should
prove
serious
could
i
endure
life
here
without
her
sweet
companionship
of
what
value
was
life
without
her
and
as
i
asked
myself
these
questions
i
learned
that
almah
had
become
dearer
to
me
than
life
itself
and
that
in
her
was
all
the
sunshine
of
my
existence
while
she
was
absent
life
was
nothing
all
its
value
all
its
light
its
flavor
its
beauty
were
gone
i
felt
utterly
crushed
i
forgot
all
else
save
her
illness
and
all
that
i
had
endured
seemed
as
nothing
when
compared
with
this
in
the
midst
of
my
own
anxiety
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
whole
community
was
most
profoundly
agitated
among
all
classes
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
thought
her
illness
i
could
overhear
them
talking
i
could
see
them
wait
outside
to
hear
about
her
it
seemed
to
be
the
one
subject
of
interest
beside
which
all
others
were
forgotten
the
kohen
was
absorbed
in
her
case
all
the
physicians
of
the
city
were
more
or
less
engaged
in
her
behalf
and
there
came
forward
as
volunteers
every
woman
in
the
place
who
had
any
knowledge
of
i
was
somewhat
perplexed
however
at
their
manner
they
were
certainly
agitated
and
intensely
interested
yet
not
exactly
sad
indeed
from
what
i
heard
it
seemed
as
though
this
strange
people
regarded
sickness
as
rather
a
blessing
than
otherwise
this
however
did
not
interfere
in
the
slightest
degree
with
the
most
intense
interest
in
her
and
the
most
assiduous
attention
the
kohen
in
particular
was
devoted
to
her
he
was
silent
and
full
of
care
on
the
whole
i
felt
more
than
ever
puzzled
and
less
able
than
ever
to
understand
these
people
i
loved
them
yet
loathed
them
for
the
kohen
i
had
at
once
affection
and
horror
he
looked
like
an
anxious
father
full
of
tenderest
love
for
a
sick
child
full
also
of
delicate
sympathy
with
me
and
yet
i
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
quite
capable
of
plunging
the
sacrificial
knife
in
almah
heart
and
of
eating
her
afterward
but
my
own
thoughts
were
all
of
almah
i
learned
how
dear
she
was
with
her
the
brightness
of
life
had
passed
without
her
existence
would
be
intolerable
her
sweet
voice
her
tender
and
gracious
manner
her
soft
touch
her
tender
affectionate
smile
her
mournful
yet
trustful
look
oh
heavens
would
all
these
be
mine
no
more
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
at
first
i
wandered
about
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
and
at
length
i
sat
in
my
own
room
and
passed
the
time
in
listening
in
questioning
the
attendants
in
wondering
what
i
should
do
if
she
should
be
taken
from
me
at
length
on
one
blessed
jom
the
kohen
came
to
me
with
a
bright
smile
our
darling
almah
is
better
said
he
eat
i
beseech
you
she
is
very
dear
to
all
of
us
and
we
have
all
felt
for
her
and
for
you
but
now
all
danger
is
past
the
physicians
say
that
she
will
soon
be
well
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
it
may
have
been
caused
by
the
bright
light
but
i
attributed
this
to
his
loving
heart
and
i
forgot
that
he
was
a
cannibal
i
took
his
hands
in
mine
and
pressed
them
in
deep
emotion
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sweet
and
gentle
smile
i
see
it
all
said
he
in
a
low
voice
you
love
her
i
pressed
his
hands
harder
but
said
nothing
indeed
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
i
knew
it
said
he
it
is
but
natural
you
are
both
of
a
different
race
from
us
you
are
both
much
alike
and
in
full
sympathy
with
one
another
this
draws
you
together
when
i
first
saw
you
i
thought
that
you
would
be
a
fit
companion
for
her
here
that
you
would
lessen
her
gloom
and
that
she
would
be
pleasant
to
you
i
found
out
soon
that
i
was
right
and
i
felt
glad
for
you
at
once
showed
the
fullest
sympathy
with
one
another
never
till
you
came
was
almah
happy
with
us
but
since
you
have
come
she
has
been
a
different
being
and
there
has
been
a
joyousness
in
her
manner
that
i
never
saw
before
you
have
made
her
forget
how
to
weep
and
as
for
yourself
i
hope
she
has
made
your
life
in
this
strange
land
seem
less
painful
at
all
this
i
was
so
full
of
amazement
that
i
could
not
say
one
word
pardon
me
continued
he
if
i
have
said
anything
that
may
seem
like
an
intrusion
upon
your
secret
and
most
sacred
feelings
i
could
not
have
said
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
deep
affection
i
feel
for
almah
and
for
you
and
for
the
reason
that
i
am
just
now
more
moved
than
usual
and
have
less
control
over
my
feelings
saying
this
he
pressed
my
hand
and
left
me
it
was
not
the
custom
here
to
shake
hands
but
with
his
usual
amiability
he
had
adopted
my
custom
and
used
it
as
naturally
as
though
he
had
been
to
the
manner
born
i
was
encouraged
now
the
mild
kohen
came
often
to
cheer
me
he
talked
much
about
almah
about
her
sweet
and
gracious
disposition
the
love
that
all
felt
for
her
the
deep
and
intense
interest
which
her
illness
had
aroused
in
all
this
he
seemed
more
like
a
man
of
my
own
race
than
before
and
in
his
eager
desire
for
her
recovery
he
failed
to
exhibit
that
love
for
death
which
was
his
nature
so
it
seemed
yet
this
desire
for
her
recovery
did
not
arise
out
of
any
lack
of
love
for
death
its
true
cause
i
was
to
learn
afterward
and
i
was
to
know
that
if
he
desired
almah
recovery
now
it
was
only
that
she
might
live
long
enough
to
encounter
death
in
a
more
terrific
form
but
just
then
all
this
was
unknown
and
i
judged
him
by
myself
at
last
i
learned
that
she
was
much
better
and
would
be
out
on
the
following
jom
this
intelligence
filled
me
with
a
fever
of
eager
anticipation
so
great
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
sleep
was
impossible
i
could
only
wait
and
try
as
best
i
might
to
quell
my
impatience
at
last
the
time
came
i
sat
waiting
the
curtain
was
drawn
aside
i
sprang
up
and
hurrying
toward
her
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
wept
for
joy
ah
me
how
pale
she
looked
she
bore
still
the
marks
of
her
illness
she
seemed
deeply
embarrassed
and
agitated
at
the
fervor
of
my
greeting
while
i
instead
of
apologizing
or
trying
to
excuse
myself
only
grew
more
agitated
still
oh
almah
i
cried
i
should
have
died
if
you
had
not
come
back
to
me
oh
almah
i
love
you
better
than
life
and
i
never
knew
how
dearly
i
loved
you
till
i
thought
that
i
had
lost
you
oh
forgive
me
but
i
must
tell
you
and
do
weep
darling
she
was
weeping
as
i
spoke
she
said
nothing
but
twined
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
wept
on
my
breast
after
this
we
had
much
to
say
that
we
had
never
mentioned
before
i
can
not
tell
the
sweet
words
that
she
said
to
me
but
i
now
learned
that
she
had
loved
me
from
the
first
when
i
came
to
her
in
her
loneliness
when
she
was
homesick
and
heartsick
and
i
came
a
kindred
nature
of
a
race
more
like
her
own
and
she
saw
in
me
the
only
one
of
all
around
her
whom
it
was
possible
not
to
detest
and
therefore
she
loved
me
we
had
many
things
to
say
to
one
another
and
long
exchanges
of
confidence
to
make
she
now
for
the
first
time
told
me
all
the
sorrow
that
she
had
endured
in
her
captivity
sorrow
which
she
had
kept
silent
and
shut
up
deep
within
her
breast
at
first
her
life
here
had
been
so
terrible
that
it
had
brought
her
down
nearly
to
death
after
this
she
had
sunk
into
dull
despair
she
had
grown
familiar
with
horrors
and
lived
in
a
state
of
unnatural
calm
from
this
my
arrival
had
roused
her
the
display
of
feeling
on
my
part
had
brought
back
all
her
old
self
and
roused
anew
all
those
feelings
which
in
her
had
become
dormant
the
darkness
the
bloodshed
the
sacrifices
all
these
affected
me
as
they
had
once
affected
her
i
had
the
same
fear
of
death
which
she
had
when
i
had
gone
with
her
to
the
cheder
nebilin
when
i
had
used
my
to
save
life
she
had
perceived
in
me
feelings
and
impulses
to
which
all
her
own
nature
responded
finally
when
i
asked
about
the
mista
kosek
she
warned
me
not
to
go
when
i
did
go
she
was
with
me
in
thought
and
suffered
all
that
i
felt
until
the
moment
when
i
was
brought
back
and
laid
senseless
at
her
feet
then
said
almah
i
felt
the
full
meaning
of
all
that
lies
before
us
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
asked
anxiously
you
speak
as
though
there
were
something
yet
worse
than
what
has
already
been
yet
nothing
can
possibly
be
worse
we
have
seen
the
worst
let
us
now
try
to
shake
off
these
grisly
thoughts
and
be
happy
with
one
another
your
strength
will
soon
be
back
and
while
we
have
one
another
we
can
be
happy
even
in
this
gloom
ah
me
said
almah
it
would
be
better
now
to
die
i
could
die
happy
now
since
i
know
that
you
love
me
death
said
i
do
not
talk
of
it
do
not
mention
that
word
it
is
more
abhorrent
than
ever
no
almah
let
us
live
and
love
let
us
hope
let
us
fly
impossible
said
she
in
a
mournful
voice
we
can
not
fly
there
is
no
hope
we
must
face
the
future
and
make
up
our
minds
to
bear
our
fate
fate
i
repeated
looking
at
her
in
wonder
and
in
deep
concern
what
do
you
mean
by
our
fate
is
there
anything
more
which
you
know
and
which
i
have
not
heard
you
have
heard
nothing
said
she
slowly
and
all
that
you
have
seen
and
heard
is
as
nothing
compared
with
what
lies
before
us
for
you
and
for
me
there
is
a
fate
inconceivable
abhorrent
tremendous
a
fate
of
which
i
dare
not
speak
or
even
think
and
from
which
there
is
no
escape
whatever
as
almah
said
this
she
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
in
which
terror
and
anguish
were
striving
with
love
her
cheeks
which
shortly
before
had
flushed
rosy
red
in
sweet
confusion
were
now
pallid
her
lips
ashen
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
wild
despair
i
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
could
not
say
a
word
oh
said
she
i
am
afraid
of
death
almah
said
i
why
will
you
speak
of
death
what
is
this
fate
which
you
fear
so
much
it
is
this
said
she
hurriedly
and
with
a
shudder
you
and
i
are
singled
out
i
have
been
reserved
for
years
until
one
should
be
found
who
might
be
joined
with
me
you
came
i
saw
it
all
at
once
i
have
known
it
dreaded
it
tried
to
fight
against
it
but
it
was
of
no
use
oh
our
love
means
death
for
the
very
fact
that
you
love
me
and
i
love
you
seals
our
doom
our
doom
what
doom
the
sacrifice
exclaimed
almah
with
another
shudder
in
her
voice
and
look
there
was
a
terrible
meaning
which
i
could
not
fail
to
take
i
understood
it
now
and
my
blood
curdled
in
my
veins
almah
clung
to
me
despairingly
do
not
leave
me
she
cried
do
not
leave
me
i
have
no
one
but
you
the
sacrifice
the
sacrifice
it
is
our
doom
the
great
sacrifice
at
the
end
of
the
dark
season
it
is
at
the
amir
we
must
go
there
to
meet
our
doom
the
amir
i
asked
what
is
that
it
is
the
metropolis
said
she
i
was
utterly
overwhelmed
yet
still
i
tried
to
console
her
but
the
attempt
was
vain
oh
she
cried
you
will
not
understand
the
sacrifice
is
but
a
part
it
is
but
the
beginning
death
is
terrible
yet
it
may
be
endured
if
there
is
only
death
but
oh
oh
think
think
of
that
which
comes
after
the
mista
kosek
now
the
full
meaning
flashed
upon
me
and
i
saw
it
all
in
an
instant
there
arose
in
my
mind
the
awful
sacrifice
on
the
pyramid
and
the
unutterable
horror
of
the
mista
kosek
oh
horror
horror
horror
oh
hideous
abomination
and
deed
without
a
name
i
could
not
speak
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
we
both
wept
passionately
the
happiness
of
our
love
was
now
darkened
by
this
tremendous
cloud
that
lowered
before
us
the
shock
of
this
discovery
was
overpowering
and
some
time
elapsed
before
i
could
rally
from
it
though
love
was
sweet
beyond
expression
and
though
as
the
time
passed
i
saw
that
every
jom
she
regained
more
and
more
of
her
former
health
and
strength
still
i
could
not
forget
what
had
been
revealed
we
were
happy
with
one
another
yet
our
happiness
was
clouded
and
amid
the
brightness
of
our
love
there
was
ever
present
the
dread
spectre
of
our
appalling
doom
these
feelings
however
grew
fainter
hope
is
ever
ready
to
arise
and
i
began
to
think
that
these
people
though
given
to
evil
ways
were
after
all
and
might
listen
to
entreaty
above
all
there
was
the
kohen
so
benevolent
so
so
amiable
so
sympathetic
i
could
not
forget
all
that
he
had
said
during
illness
and
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
an
appeal
to
his
better
nature
might
not
be
without
effect
i
said
as
much
to
almah
the
kohen
said
she
why
he
can
do
nothing
why
not
he
is
the
chief
man
here
and
ought
to
have
great
influence
you
do
understand
said
she
with
a
sigh
the
kohen
is
the
lowest
and
least
influential
man
in
the
city
why
who
are
influential
if
he
is
not
i
asked
the
paupers
said
almah
the
paupers
i
exclaimed
in
amazement
yes
said
almah
here
among
these
people
the
paupers
form
the
most
honored
influential
and
envied
portion
of
the
community
this
was
incomprehensible
almah
tried
to
explain
but
to
no
purpose
and
i
determined
to
talk
to
the
kohen
chapter
xv
the
kohen
is
inexorable
i
determined
to
talk
to
the
kohen
and
try
for
myself
whether
he
might
not
be
accessible
to
pity
this
greatest
of
cannibals
might
indeed
have
his
little
peculiarities
i
thought
and
who
has
not
yet
at
bottom
he
seemed
full
of
tender
and
benevolent
feeling
and
as
he
evidently
spent
his
whole
time
in
the
endeavor
to
make
us
happy
it
seemed
not
unlikely
that
he
might
do
something
for
our
happiness
in
a
case
where
our
very
existence
was
at
stake
the
kohen
listened
with
deep
attention
as
i
stated
my
case
i
did
this
fully
and
frankly
i
talked
of
my
love
for
almah
and
of
almah
love
for
me
our
hope
that
we
might
be
united
so
as
to
live
happily
in
reciprocal
affection
and
i
was
going
on
to
speak
of
the
dread
that
was
in
my
heart
when
he
interrupted
me
you
speak
of
being
united
said
he
you
talk
strangely
of
course
you
mean
that
you
wish
to
be
separated
separated
i
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
of
course
we
wish
to
be
united
the
kohen
stared
at
me
as
i
said
this
with
the
look
of
one
who
was
quite
puzzled
and
i
then
went
on
to
speak
of
the
fate
that
was
before
us
and
to
entreat
his
sympathy
and
his
aid
that
we
might
be
saved
from
so
hideous
a
doom
to
all
these
words
the
kohen
listened
with
an
air
of
amazement
as
though
i
were
saying
incomprehensible
things
you
have
a
gentle
and
an
affectionate
nature
i
said
a
nature
full
of
sympathy
with
others
and
noble
of
course
said
the
kohen
quickly
as
though
glad
to
get
hold
of
something
which
he
could
understand
of
course
we
are
all
so
for
we
are
so
made
it
is
our
nature
who
is
there
who
is
not
no
one
can
help
that
this
sounded
strange
indeed
but
i
did
not
care
to
criticize
it
i
came
to
my
purpose
direct
and
said
save
us
from
our
fate
your
fate
yes
from
death
that
death
of
horror
death
horror
what
do
you
mean
by
horror
said
the
kohen
in
an
amazement
that
was
sincere
and
unfeigned
i
can
not
comprehend
your
meaning
it
seems
as
though
you
actually
dislike
death
but
that
is
not
conceivable
it
can
not
be
possible
that
you
fear
death
fear
death
i
exclaimed
i
do
i
do
who
is
there
that
does
not
fear
it
the
kohen
stared
i
do
not
understand
you
he
said
do
you
not
understand
said
i
that
death
is
abhorrent
to
humanity
abhorrent
said
the
kohen
that
is
impossible
is
it
not
the
highest
blessing
who
is
there
that
does
not
long
for
death
death
is
the
greatest
blessing
the
chief
desire
of
man
the
highest
aim
and
you
are
you
not
to
be
envied
in
having
your
felicity
so
near
above
all
in
having
such
a
death
as
that
which
is
appointed
for
you
so
noble
so
sublime
you
must
be
mad
your
happiness
has
turned
your
head
all
this
seemed
like
hideous
mockery
and
i
stared
at
the
kohen
with
a
gaze
that
probably
strengthened
his
opinion
of
my
madness
do
you
love
death
i
asked
at
length
in
amazement
love
death
what
a
question
of
course
i
love
death
all
men
do
who
does
not
is
it
not
human
nature
do
we
not
instinctively
fly
to
meet
it
whenever
we
can
do
we
not
rush
into
the
jaws
of
or
throw
ourselves
within
their
grasp
who
does
not
feel
within
him
this
intense
longing
after
death
as
the
strongest
passion
of
his
heart
i
do
know
i
do
know
said
i
you
are
of
a
different
race
i
do
not
understand
what
you
say
but
i
belong
to
a
race
that
fears
death
i
fear
death
and
love
life
and
i
entreat
you
i
implore
you
to
help
me
now
in
my
distress
and
assist
me
so
that
i
may
save
my
life
and
that
of
almah
i
i
help
you
said
the
kohen
in
new
amazement
why
do
you
come
to
me
to
me
of
all
men
why
i
am
nothing
here
and
help
you
to
live
to
live
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
the
kohen
looked
at
me
with
the
same
astonishment
which
i
should
evince
if
a
man
should
ask
me
to
help
him
to
die
still
i
persisted
in
my
entreaty
for
his
help
such
a
request
said
he
is
revolting
you
must
be
mad
such
a
request
outrages
all
the
instincts
of
humanity
and
even
if
i
could
do
such
violence
to
my
own
nature
as
to
help
you
to
such
a
thing
how
do
you
think
i
could
face
my
or
how
could
i
endure
the
terrible
punishment
which
would
fall
upon
me
punishment
said
i
what
would
you
be
punished
punished
said
the
kohen
that
of
course
would
be
inevitable
i
should
be
esteemed
an
unnatural
monster
and
the
chief
of
criminals
my
lot
in
life
now
is
painful
enough
but
in
this
case
my
punishment
would
involve
me
in
evils
without
end
riches
would
be
poured
upon
me
i
should
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
kohen
gadol
i
should
be
removed
farther
away
than
ever
from
the
pauper
class
so
far
indeed
that
all
hope
in
life
would
be
over
i
should
be
made
the
first
and
noblest
and
richest
in
all
the
land
he
spoke
these
words
just
as
if
he
had
said
the
lowest
meanest
poorest
and
most
infamous
it
sounded
like
fresh
mockery
and
i
could
not
believe
but
that
he
was
amusing
himself
at
my
expense
this
is
cruel
said
i
you
are
mocking
me
cruel
cruel
said
he
what
is
cruel
you
mean
that
such
a
fate
would
be
cruel
for
me
no
no
said
i
but
alas
i
see
we
can
not
understand
one
another
no
said
the
kohen
musingly
as
he
looked
at
me
no
it
seems
not
but
tell
me
is
it
possible
that
you
really
fear
death
that
you
really
love
life
fear
death
love
life
i
cried
who
does
not
who
can
help
it
why
do
you
ask
me
that
the
kohen
clasped
his
hands
in
amazement
if
you
really
fear
death
said
he
what
possible
thing
is
there
left
to
love
or
to
hope
for
what
then
do
you
think
the
highest
blessing
of
man
long
life
said
i
and
riches
and
requited
love
at
this
the
kohen
started
back
and
stared
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
raving
madman
oh
holy
shades
of
night
he
exclaimed
what
is
that
you
say
what
do
you
mean
we
can
never
understand
one
another
i
fear
said
i
the
love
of
life
must
necessarily
be
the
strongest
passion
of
man
we
are
so
made
we
give
up
everything
for
life
a
long
life
is
everywhere
considered
as
the
highest
blessing
and
there
is
no
one
who
is
willing
to
die
no
matter
what
his
suffering
may
be
riches
also
are
desired
by
all
for
poverty
is
the
direst
curse
that
can
embitter
life
and
as
to
requited
love
surely
that
is
the
sweetest
purest
and
most
divine
joy
that
the
human
heart
may
know
at
this
the
kohen
burst
forth
in
a
strain
of
high
excitement
oh
sacred
cavern
gloom
oh
divine
darkness
oh
impenetrable
abysses
of
night
what
oh
what
is
this
oh
are
you
mad
alas
it
must
be
so
joy
has
turned
your
brain
you
are
quite
demented
you
call
good
evil
and
evil
good
our
light
is
your
darkness
and
our
darkness
your
light
yet
surely
you
can
not
be
altogether
insane
come
come
let
us
look
further
how
is
it
try
now
to
recall
your
reason
a
long
life
a
life
and
a
long
one
surely
there
can
be
no
human
being
in
a
healthy
state
of
nature
who
wishes
to
prolong
his
life
and
as
to
riches
it
is
possible
that
anyone
exists
who
really
and
honestly
desires
riches
impossible
and
requited
love
oh
you
are
mad
you
are
always
strange
but
now
you
have
quite
taken
leave
of
your
senses
i
can
not
but
love
you
and
yet
i
can
never
understand
you
tell
me
and
tell
me
truly
what
is
it
that
you
consider
evils
if
these
things
that
you
have
mentioned
are
not
the
very
worst
he
seemed
deeply
in
earnest
and
much
moved
i
could
not
understand
him
but
could
only
answer
his
questions
with
simple
conciseness
poverty
sickness
and
death
said
i
are
evils
but
the
worst
of
all
evils
is
unrequited
love
at
these
words
the
kohen
made
a
gesture
of
despair
it
is
impossible
to
understand
this
said
he
you
talk
calmly
you
have
not
the
air
of
a
madman
if
your
are
all
like
you
then
your
race
is
an
incomprehensible
one
why
death
is
the
greatest
blessing
we
all
long
for
it
it
is
the
end
of
our
being
as
for
riches
they
are
a
curse
abhorred
by
all
above
all
as
to
love
we
shrink
from
the
thought
of
requital
death
is
our
chief
blessing
poverty
our
greatest
happiness
and
unrequited
love
the
sweetest
lot
of
man
all
this
sounded
like
the
ravings
of
a
lunatic
yet
the
kohen
was
not
mad
it
seemed
also
like
the
mockery
of
some
teasing
demon
but
the
gentle
and
kohen
was
no
teasing
demon
and
mockery
with
him
was
impossible
i
was
therefore
more
bewildered
than
ever
at
this
reiteration
of
sentiments
that
were
so
utterly
incomprehensible
he
on
the
other
hand
seemed
as
astonished
at
my
sentiments
and
as
bewildered
and
we
could
find
no
common
ground
on
which
to
meet
i
remember
now
said
the
kohen
in
a
musing
tone
having
heard
of
some
strange
folk
at
the
amir
who
profess
to
feel
as
you
say
you
feel
but
no
one
believes
that
they
are
in
earnest
for
although
they
may
even
bring
themselves
to
think
that
they
are
in
earnest
in
their
professions
yet
after
all
everyone
thinks
that
they
are
for
you
see
in
the
first
place
these
feelings
which
you
profess
are
utterly
unnatural
we
are
so
made
that
we
can
not
help
loving
death
it
is
a
sort
of
instinct
we
are
also
created
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
not
help
longing
after
poverty
the
pauper
must
always
among
all
men
be
the
most
envied
of
mortals
nature
too
has
made
us
such
that
the
passion
of
love
when
it
arises
is
so
vehement
so
that
it
must
always
struggle
to
avoid
requital
this
is
the
reason
why
when
two
people
find
that
they
love
each
other
they
always
separate
and
avoid
one
another
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
this
is
human
nature
we
can
not
help
it
and
it
is
this
that
distinguishes
us
from
the
animals
why
if
men
were
to
feel
as
you
say
you
feel
they
would
be
mere
animals
animals
fear
death
animals
love
to
accumulate
such
things
as
they
prize
animals
when
they
love
go
in
pairs
and
remain
with
one
another
but
man
with
his
intellect
would
not
be
man
if
he
loved
life
and
desired
riches
and
sought
for
requited
love
i
sank
back
in
despair
you
can
not
mean
all
this
i
said
he
threw
at
me
a
piteous
glance
what
else
can
you
believe
or
feel
said
he
the
very
opposite
we
are
so
made
that
we
hate
and
fear
death
to
us
he
is
the
king
of
terrors
poverty
is
terrible
also
since
it
is
associated
with
want
and
woe
it
is
therefore
natural
to
man
to
strive
after
riches
as
to
the
passion
of
love
that
is
so
vehement
that
the
first
and
only
thought
is
requital
unrequited
love
is
anguish
beyond
expression
anguish
so
severe
that
the
heart
will
often
break
under
it
the
kohen
clasped
his
hands
in
new
bewilderment
i
can
not
understand
said
he
a
madman
might
imagine
that
he
loved
life
and
desired
riches
but
as
to
love
why
even
a
madman
could
not
think
of
requital
for
the
very
nature
of
the
passion
of
love
is
the
most
utter
and
a
shrinking
from
all
requital
wherefore
the
feeling
that
leads
one
to
desire
requital
can
not
be
love
i
do
not
know
what
it
can
be
indeed
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
and
the
annals
of
the
human
race
make
no
mention
of
such
a
feeling
for
what
is
love
it
is
the
ardent
outflow
of
the
whole
being
the
yearning
of
one
human
heart
to
lavish
all
its
treasures
upon
another
love
is
more
than
it
is
and
utter
love
gives
all
away
and
can
not
possibly
receive
anything
in
return
a
requital
of
love
would
mean
selfishness
which
would
be
the
more
one
loves
the
more
he
must
shrink
from
requital
what
cried
i
among
you
do
lovers
never
marry
lovers
marry
never
do
married
people
never
love
one
another
the
kohen
shook
his
head
it
unfortunately
sometimes
happens
so
said
he
and
then
the
result
is
of
course
distressing
for
the
children
sake
the
parents
will
often
remain
with
one
another
but
in
many
cases
they
separate
no
one
can
tell
the
misery
that
ensues
where
a
husband
and
wife
love
one
another
the
conversation
grew
insupportable
i
could
not
follow
the
kohen
in
what
seemed
the
wildest
and
maddest
flights
of
fancy
that
ever
were
known
so
i
began
to
talk
of
other
things
and
gradually
the
kohen
was
drawn
to
speak
of
his
own
life
the
account
which
he
gave
of
himself
was
not
one
whit
less
strange
than
his
previous
remarks
and
for
this
reason
i
add
it
here
i
was
born
said
he
in
the
most
enviable
of
positions
my
father
and
mother
were
among
the
poorest
in
the
land
both
died
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
never
saw
them
i
grew
up
in
the
open
fields
and
public
caverns
along
with
the
most
esteemed
paupers
but
unfortunately
for
me
there
was
something
wanting
in
my
natural
disposition
i
loved
death
of
course
and
poverty
too
very
strongly
but
i
did
not
have
that
eager
and
energetic
passion
which
is
so
desirable
nor
was
i
watchful
enough
over
my
blessed
estate
of
poverty
surrounded
as
i
was
by
those
who
were
only
too
ready
to
take
advantage
of
my
ignorance
or
want
of
vigilance
i
soon
fell
into
evil
ways
and
gradually
in
spite
of
myself
i
found
wealth
pouring
in
upon
me
designing
men
succeeded
in
winning
my
consent
to
receive
their
possessions
and
so
i
gradually
fell
away
from
that
lofty
position
in
which
i
was
born
i
grew
richer
and
richer
my
friends
warned
me
but
in
vain
i
was
too
weak
to
resist
in
fact
i
lacked
moral
fibre
and
had
never
learned
how
to
say
so
i
went
on
descending
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
of
being
i
became
a
capitalist
an
athon
a
general
officer
and
finally
kohen
at
length
on
one
eventful
day
i
learned
that
one
of
my
associates
had
by
a
long
course
of
reckless
folly
become
the
richest
man
in
all
the
country
he
had
become
athon
melek
and
at
last
kohen
gadol
it
was
a
terrible
shock
but
i
trust
a
salutary
one
i
at
once
resolved
to
reform
that
resolution
i
have
steadily
kept
and
have
at
least
saved
myself
from
descending
any
lower
it
is
true
i
can
hardly
hope
to
become
what
i
once
was
it
is
only
too
easy
to
grow
rich
and
you
know
poverty
once
forfeited
can
never
return
except
in
rare
instances
i
have
however
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
most
of
my
wealth
chiefly
through
the
fortunate
advent
of
almah
and
afterward
of
yourself
this
i
confess
has
been
my
salvation
neither
of
you
had
any
scruples
about
accepting
what
was
bestowed
and
so
i
did
not
feel
as
though
i
was
doing
you
any
wrong
in
giving
you
all
i
had
in
the
world
most
of
the
people
of
this
city
have
taken
advantage
of
your
extraordinary
indifference
to
wealth
and
have
made
themselves
paupers
at
your
expense
i
had
already
become
your
slave
and
had
received
the
promise
of
being
elevated
to
the
rank
of
scullion
in
the
cavern
of
the
mista
kosek
but
now
since
this
event
of
your
love
for
almah
i
hope
to
gain
far
more
i
am
almost
certain
of
being
made
a
pauper
and
i
think
i
can
almost
venture
to
hope
some
day
for
the
honor
of
a
public
death
to
such
a
story
i
had
nothing
to
say
it
was
sheer
madness
yet
it
was
terribly
suggestive
and
showed
how
utterly
hopeless
was
my
effort
to
secure
the
assistance
of
such
a
man
toward
my
escape
from
death
a
public
death
i
said
grimly
that
will
be
very
fortunate
and
do
you
think
that
you
will
gain
the
dignity
of
being
eaten
up
afterward
the
kohen
shook
his
head
in
all
seriousness
oh
no
said
he
that
would
be
far
beyond
my
deserts
that
is
an
honor
which
is
only
bestowed
upon
the
most
distinguished
chapter
xvi
the
kosekin
these
people
call
themselves
the
kosekin
their
chief
characteristic
or
at
least
their
most
prominent
one
is
their
love
of
darkness
which
perhaps
is
due
to
their
habit
of
dwelling
in
caves
another
feeling
equally
strong
and
perhaps
connected
with
this
is
their
love
of
death
and
dislike
of
life
this
is
visible
in
many
ways
and
affects
all
their
character
it
leads
to
a
passionate
an
incessant
effort
to
benefit
others
at
their
own
expense
each
one
hates
life
and
longs
for
death
he
therefore
hates
riches
and
all
things
that
are
associated
with
life
among
the
kosekin
everyone
makes
perpetual
efforts
to
serve
others
which
however
are
perpetually
baffled
by
the
unselfishness
of
these
others
people
thus
spend
years
in
trying
to
overreach
one
another
so
as
to
make
others
richer
than
themselves
in
a
race
each
one
tries
to
keep
behind
but
as
this
leads
to
confusion
there
is
then
a
universal
effort
for
each
one
to
be
first
so
as
to
put
his
neighbor
in
the
honorable
position
of
the
rear
it
is
the
same
way
in
a
hunt
each
one
presses
forward
so
as
to
honor
his
companion
by
leaving
him
behind
instead
of
injuring
everyone
tries
to
benefit
his
neighbor
when
one
has
been
benefited
by
another
he
is
filled
with
a
passion
which
may
be
called
kosekin
revenge
namely
a
sleepless
and
vehement
desire
to
bestow
some
adequate
and
corresponding
benefit
on
the
other
feuds
are
thus
kept
up
among
families
and
wars
among
nations
for
no
one
is
willing
to
accept
from
another
any
kindness
any
gift
or
any
honor
and
all
are
continually
on
the
watch
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
overreached
in
this
way
those
who
are
less
watchful
than
others
are
overwhelmed
with
gifts
by
designing
men
who
wish
to
attain
to
the
pauper
class
the
position
of
almah
and
myself
illustrates
this
our
ignorance
of
the
blessings
and
honors
of
poverty
led
us
to
receive
whatever
was
offered
us
taking
advantage
of
our
innocence
and
ignorance
the
whole
city
thereupon
proceeded
to
bestow
their
property
upon
us
and
all
became
paupers
through
our
fortunate
arrival
no
one
ever
injures
another
unless
by
accident
and
when
this
occurs
it
affords
the
highest
joy
to
the
injured
party
he
has
now
a
claim
on
the
injurer
he
gets
him
into
his
power
is
able
to
confer
benefits
on
him
and
force
upon
him
all
that
he
wishes
the
unhappy
injurer
thus
punished
by
the
reception
of
wealth
finds
himself
helpless
and
where
the
injury
is
great
the
injured
man
may
bestow
upon
the
other
all
his
wealth
and
attain
to
the
envied
condition
of
a
pauper
among
the
kosekin
the
sick
are
objects
of
the
highest
regard
all
classes
vie
with
one
another
in
their
attentions
the
rich
send
their
luxuries
the
paupers
however
not
having
anything
to
give
go
themselves
and
wait
on
them
and
nurse
them
for
this
there
is
no
help
and
the
rich
grumble
but
can
do
nothing
the
sick
are
thus
sought
out
incessantly
and
most
carefully
tended
when
they
die
there
is
great
rejoicing
since
death
is
a
blessing
but
the
nurses
labor
hard
to
preserve
them
in
life
so
as
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
of
the
high
privilege
of
nursing
of
all
sick
the
incurable
are
most
honored
since
they
require
nursing
always
children
also
are
highly
honored
and
esteemed
and
the
aged
too
since
both
classes
require
the
care
of
others
and
must
be
the
recipients
of
favors
which
all
are
anxious
to
bestow
those
who
suffer
from
contagious
diseases
are
more
sought
after
than
any
other
class
for
in
waiting
on
these
there
is
the
chance
of
gaining
the
blessing
of
death
indeed
in
these
cases
much
trouble
is
usually
experienced
from
the
rush
of
those
who
insist
on
offering
their
services
for
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
kosekin
love
death
as
we
love
life
and
this
accounts
for
all
those
ceremonies
which
to
me
were
so
abhorrent
especially
the
scenes
of
the
mista
kosek
to
them
a
dead
human
body
is
no
more
than
the
dead
body
of
a
bird
there
is
no
awe
felt
no
sense
of
sanctity
of
superstitious
horror
and
so
i
learned
with
a
shudder
that
the
hate
of
life
is
a
far
worse
thing
than
the
fear
of
death
this
desire
for
death
is
then
a
and
is
the
key
to
all
their
words
and
acts
they
rejoice
over
the
death
of
friends
since
those
friends
have
gained
the
greatest
of
blessings
they
rejoice
also
at
the
birth
of
children
since
those
who
are
born
will
one
day
gain
the
bliss
of
death
for
a
couple
to
fall
in
love
is
the
signal
for
mutual
each
insists
on
giving
up
the
loved
one
and
the
more
passionate
the
love
is
the
more
eager
is
the
desire
to
have
the
loved
one
married
to
someone
else
lovers
have
died
from
being
compelled
to
marry
one
another
poets
here
among
the
kosekin
celebrate
unhappy
love
which
has
met
with
this
end
these
poets
also
celebrate
defeats
instead
of
victories
since
it
is
considered
glorious
for
one
nation
to
sacrifice
itself
to
another
but
to
this
there
are
important
limitations
as
we
shall
see
poets
also
celebrate
scavengers
laborers
and
above
all
paupers
and
pass
by
as
unworthy
of
notice
the
authors
meleks
and
kohens
of
the
land
the
paupers
here
form
the
most
honorable
class
next
to
these
are
the
laborers
these
have
strikes
as
with
us
but
it
is
always
for
harder
work
longer
hours
or
smaller
pay
the
contest
between
capital
and
labor
rages
but
the
conditions
are
reversed
for
the
grumbling
capitalist
complains
that
the
laborer
will
not
take
as
much
pay
as
he
ought
to
while
the
laborer
thinks
the
capitalist
too
persistent
in
his
efforts
to
force
money
upon
him
here
among
the
kosekin
the
wealthy
class
forms
the
mass
of
the
people
while
the
aristocratic
few
consist
of
the
paupers
these
are
greatly
envied
by
the
others
and
have
many
advantages
the
cares
and
burdens
of
wealth
as
well
as
wealth
itself
are
here
considered
a
curse
and
from
all
these
the
paupers
are
exempt
there
is
a
perpetual
effort
on
the
part
of
the
wealthy
to
induce
the
paupers
to
accept
gifts
just
as
among
us
the
poor
try
to
rob
the
rich
among
the
wealthy
there
is
a
great
and
incessant
murmur
at
the
obstinacy
of
the
paupers
secret
movements
are
sometimes
set
on
foot
which
aim
at
a
redistribution
of
property
and
a
levelling
of
all
classes
so
as
to
reduce
the
haughty
paupers
to
the
same
condition
as
the
mass
of
the
nation
more
than
once
there
has
been
a
violent
attempt
at
a
revolution
so
as
to
force
wealth
on
the
paupers
but
as
a
general
thing
these
movements
have
been
put
down
and
their
leaders
severely
punished
the
paupers
have
shown
no
mercy
in
their
hour
of
triumph
they
have
not
conceded
one
jot
to
the
public
demand
and
the
unhappy
conspirators
have
been
condemned
to
increased
wealth
and
luxury
while
the
leaders
have
been
made
meleks
and
kohens
thus
there
are
among
the
kosekin
the
unfortunate
many
who
are
cursed
with
wealth
and
the
fortunate
few
who
are
blessed
with
poverty
these
walk
while
the
others
ride
and
from
their
squalid
huts
look
proudly
and
contemptuously
upon
the
palaces
of
their
unfortunate
the
love
of
death
leads
to
perpetual
efforts
on
the
part
of
each
to
lay
down
his
life
for
another
this
is
a
grave
difficulty
in
hunts
and
battles
confined
prisoners
dare
not
fly
for
in
such
an
event
the
guards
kill
themselves
this
leads
to
fresh
rigors
in
the
captivity
of
the
prisoners
in
case
of
their
recapture
for
they
are
overwhelmed
with
fresh
luxuries
and
increased
splendors
finally
if
a
prisoner
persist
and
is
recaptured
he
is
solemnly
put
to
death
not
as
with
us
by
way
of
severity
but
as
the
last
and
greatest
honor
here
extremes
meet
and
death
whether
for
honor
or
dishonor
is
all
the
same
death
and
is
reserved
for
desperate
cases
but
among
the
kosekin
this
lofty
destiny
is
somewhat
embittered
by
the
agonizing
thought
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
who
thus
gains
it
that
his
wretched
family
must
be
doomed
not
as
with
us
to
poverty
and
want
but
on
the
contrary
to
boundless
wealth
and
splendor
among
so
strange
a
people
it
seemed
singular
to
me
what
offences
could
possibly
be
committed
which
could
be
regarded
and
punished
as
crimes
these
however
i
soon
found
out
instead
of
robbers
the
kosekin
punished
the
secret
bestowers
of
their
wealth
on
others
this
is
regarded
as
a
very
grave
offence
analogous
to
our
crime
of
piracy
is
the
forcible
arrest
of
ships
at
sea
and
the
transfer
to
them
of
valuables
sometimes
the
kosekin
pirates
give
themselves
up
as
slaves
kidnapping
assault
highway
robbery
and
crimes
of
violence
have
their
parallel
here
in
cases
where
a
strong
man
meeting
a
weaker
forces
himself
upon
him
as
his
slave
or
compels
him
to
take
his
purse
if
the
weaker
refuse
the
assailant
threatens
to
kill
himself
which
act
would
lay
the
other
under
obligations
to
receive
punishment
from
the
state
in
the
shape
of
gifts
and
honors
or
at
least
subject
him
to
unpleasant
inquiries
murder
has
its
counterpart
among
the
kosekin
in
cases
where
one
man
meets
another
forces
money
on
him
and
kills
himself
forgery
occurs
where
one
uses
another
name
so
as
to
confer
money
on
him
there
are
many
other
crimes
all
of
which
are
severely
punished
the
worse
the
offence
is
the
better
is
the
offender
treated
among
the
kosekin
capital
punishment
is
imprisonment
amid
the
greatest
splendor
where
the
prisoner
is
treated
like
a
king
and
has
many
palaces
and
great
retinues
for
that
which
we
consider
the
highest
they
regard
as
the
lowest
and
with
them
the
chief
post
of
honor
is
what
we
would
call
the
lowest
menial
office
of
course
among
such
a
people
any
suffering
from
want
is
unknown
except
when
it
is
voluntary
the
pauper
class
with
all
their
great
privileges
have
this
restriction
that
they
are
forced
to
receive
enough
for
food
and
clothing
some
indeed
manage
by
living
in
places
to
deprive
themselves
of
these
and
have
been
known
to
die
of
starvation
but
this
is
regarded
as
dishonorable
as
taking
an
undue
advantage
of
a
great
position
and
where
it
can
be
proved
the
children
and
relatives
of
the
offender
are
severely
punished
according
to
the
kosekin
fashion
state
politics
here
move
like
individual
affairs
upon
the
great
principle
of
contempt
for
earthly
things
the
state
is
willing
to
destroy
itself
for
the
good
of
other
states
but
as
other
states
are
in
the
same
position
nothing
can
result
in
times
of
war
the
object
of
each
army
is
to
honor
the
other
and
benefit
it
by
giving
it
the
glory
of
defeat
the
contest
is
thus
most
fierce
the
kosekin
through
their
passionate
love
of
death
are
terrible
in
battle
and
when
they
are
also
animated
by
the
desire
to
confer
glory
on
their
enemies
by
defeating
them
they
generally
succeed
in
their
aim
this
makes
them
almost
always
victorious
and
when
they
are
not
so
not
a
soul
returns
alive
their
state
of
mind
is
peculiar
if
they
are
defeated
they
rejoice
since
defeat
is
their
chief
glory
but
if
they
are
victorious
they
rejoice
still
more
in
the
benevolent
thought
that
they
have
conferred
upon
the
enemy
the
joy
the
glory
and
the
honor
of
defeat
here
all
shrink
from
governing
others
the
highest
wish
of
each
is
to
serve
the
meleks
and
kohens
whom
i
at
first
considered
the
highest
are
really
the
lowest
orders
next
to
these
come
the
authors
then
the
merchants
then
farmers
then
artisans
then
laborers
and
finally
the
highest
rank
is
reached
in
the
paupers
happy
the
aristocratic
the
haughty
the
envied
paupers
the
same
thing
is
seen
in
their
armies
the
privates
here
are
highest
in
rank
and
the
officers
come
next
in
different
graduations
these
officers
however
have
the
command
and
the
charge
of
affairs
as
with
us
yet
this
is
consistent
with
their
position
for
here
to
obey
is
considered
nobler
than
to
command
in
the
fleet
the
rowers
are
the
highest
class
next
come
the
and
lowest
of
all
are
the
officers
war
arises
from
motives
as
peculiar
as
those
which
give
rise
to
private
feuds
as
for
instance
where
one
nation
tries
to
force
a
province
upon
another
where
they
try
to
make
each
other
greater
where
they
try
to
benefit
unduly
each
other
commerce
where
one
may
have
a
smaller
fleet
or
army
than
has
been
agreed
on
or
where
an
ambassador
has
been
presented
with
gifts
or
received
too
great
honor
or
attention
in
such
a
country
as
this
where
riches
are
disliked
and
despised
i
could
not
imagine
how
people
could
be
induced
to
engage
in
trade
this
however
was
soon
explained
the
laborers
and
artisans
have
to
perform
their
daily
work
so
as
to
enable
the
community
to
live
and
move
and
have
its
being
their
impelling
motive
is
the
high
one
of
benefiting
others
most
directly
they
refuse
anything
but
the
very
smallest
pay
and
insist
on
giving
for
this
the
utmost
possible
labor
tradesmen
also
have
to
supply
the
community
with
articles
of
all
sorts
merchants
have
to
sail
their
ships
to
the
same
end
all
being
animated
by
the
desire
of
effecting
the
good
of
others
each
one
tries
not
to
make
money
but
to
lose
it
but
as
the
competition
is
sharp
and
universal
this
is
difficult
and
the
larger
portion
are
unsuccessful
the
purchasers
are
eager
to
pay
as
much
as
possible
and
the
merchants
and
traders
grow
rich
in
spite
of
their
utmost
endeavors
the
wealthy

go

so
as
to

but
in

they
seldom
succeed
it
has
been

that

in

succeed
in

the

is
for
all

turned
upon
the
unfortunate

a

of

of

in

of
the
mass
of
the
who
thus
are
fixed
in
their
unhappy
position
and
can
hope
for
no
escape
except
by
death
the
farmers
till
the
ground
the
fishermen
fish
the
laborers
toil
and
the
wealth
thus
created
is
pushed
from
these
incessantly
till
it
all
falls
upon
the
lowest
class
namely
the
rich
including
athons
meleks
and
kohens
it
is
a
burden
that
is
often
too
heavy
to
be
borne
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
the
seek
to
cultivate
resignation
women
and
men
are
in
every
respect
absolutely
equal
holding
precisely
the
same
offices
and
doing
the
same
work
in
general
however
it
is
observed
that
women
are
a
little
less
fond
of
death
than
men
and
a
little
less
unwilling
to
receive
gifts
for
this
reason
they
are
very
numerous
among
the
wealthy
class
and
abound
in
the
offices
of
administration
women
serve
in
the
army
and
navy
as
well
as
men
and
from
their
lack
of
ambition
or
energetic
perseverance
they
are
usually
relegated
to
the
lower
ranks
such
as
officers
and
generals
to
my
mind
it
seemed
as
though
the
women
were
in
all
the
offices
of
honor
and
dignity
but
in
reality
it
was
the
very
opposite
the
same
is
true
in
the
family
the
husbands
insist
on
giving
everything
to
the
wives
and
doing
everything
for
them
the
wives
are
therefore
universally
the
rulers
of
the
household
while
the
husbands
have
an
apparently
subordinate
but
to
the
kosekin
a
more
honorable
position
as
to
the
religion
of
the
kosekin
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
they
believe
that
after
death
they
go
to
what
they
call
the
world
of
darkness
the
death
they
long
for
leads
to
the
darkness
that
they
love
and
the
death
and
the
darkness
are
eternal
still
they
persist
in
saying
that
the
death
and
the
darkness
together
form
a
state
of
bliss
they
are
eloquent
about
the
happiness
that
awaits
them
there
in
the
sunless
land
the
world
of
darkness
but
for
my
own
part
it
always
seemed
to
me
a
state
of
nothingness
chapter
xvii
belief
and
unbelief
the
doctor
was
here
interrupted
by
featherstone
who
with
a
yawn
informed
him
that
it
was
eleven
and
that
human
endurance
had
its
limits
upon
this
the
doctor
rolled
up
the
manuscript
and
put
it
aside
for
the
night
after
which
supper
was
ordered
well
said
featherstone
what
do
you
think
of
this
last
it
contains
some
very
remarkable
statements
said
the
doctor
there
are
certainly
monsters
enough
in
it
said
melick
and
hydras
and
chimeras
dire
well
why
not
said
the
doctor
it
seems
to
me
said
melick
that
the
writer
of
this
has
peopled
his
world
with
creatures
that
resemble
the
fossil
animals
more
than
anything
else
the
fossil
animals
said
the
doctor
may
not
be
extinct
there
are
fossil
specimens
of
animals
that
still
have
living
representatives
there
is
no
reason
why
many
of
those
supposed
to
be
extinct
may
not
be
alive
now
it
is
well
known
that
many
very
remarkable
animals
have
become
extinct
within
a
comparatively
recent
period
these
great
birds
of
which
more
speaks
seem
to
me
to
belong
to
these
classes
the
dodo
was
in
existence
fifty
years
ago
the
moa
about
a
hundred
years
ago
these
great
birds
together
with
others
such
as
the
epiornis
and
palapteryx
have
disappeared
not
through
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
but
by
the
hand
of
man
even
in
our
hemisphere
they
may
yet
be
found
who
can
tell
but
that
the
moa
or
the
dodo
may
yet
be
lurking
somewhere
here
in
the
interior
of
madagascar
of
borneo
or
of
papua
can
you
make
out
anything
about
those
great
birds
asked
featherstone
do
they
resemble
anything
that
exists
now
or
has
ever
existed
well
yes
i
think
so
said
the
doctor
unfortunately
more
is
not
at
all
close
or
accurate
in
his
descriptions
he
has
a
decidedly
unscientific
mind
and
so
one
can
not
feel
sure
yet
from
his
general
statements
i
think
i
can
decide
pretty
nearly
upon
the
nature
and
the
scientific
name
of
each
one
of
his
birds
and
animals
it
is
quite
evident
to
me
that
most
of
these
animals
belong
to
races
that
no
longer
exist
among
us
and
that
this
world
at
the
south
pole
has
many
characteristics
which
are
like
those
of
what
is
known
as
the
coal
period
i
allude
in
particular
to
the
vast
forests
of
fern
of
gigantic
grasses
and
reeds
at
the
same
time
the
general
climate
and
the
atmosphere
seem
like
what
we
may
find
in
the
tropics
at
present
it
is
evident
that
in
more
world
various
epochs
are
represented
and
that
animals
of
different
ages
are
living
side
by
side
what
do
you
think
of
the
opkuk
asked
featherstone
with
a
yawn
well
i
hardly
know
why
it
must
be
a
dodo
of
course
said
melick
only
magnified
that
said
the
doctor
gravely
is
a
thought
that
naturally
suggests
itself
but
then
the
opkuk
is
certainly
far
larger
than
the
dodo
oh
more
put
on
his
just
then
the
dodo
continued
the
doctor
taking
no
notice
of
this
in
other
respects
corresponds
with
more
description
of
the
opkuk
clusius
and
bontius
give
good
descriptions
and
there
is
a
picture
of
one
in
the
british
museum
it
is
a
massive
clumsy
bird
ungraceful
in
its
form
with
heavy
movements
wings
too
short
for
flight
little
or
no
tail
and
down
rather
than
feathers
the
body
according
to
bontius
is
as
big
as
that
of
the
african
ostrich
but
the
legs
are
very
short
it
has
a
large
head
great
black
eyes
long
bill
ending
in
a
beak
like
that
of
a
vulture
yellow
legs
thick
and
short
four
toes
on
each
foot
solid
long
and
armed
with
sharp
black
claws
the
flesh
particularly
on
the
breast
is
fat
and
esculent
now
all
this
corresponds
with
more
account
except
as
to
the
size
of
the
two
for
the
opkuks
are
as
large
as
oxen
oh
that
nothing
said
melick
i
determined
to
stand
up
for
the
dodo
with
this
he
burst
forth
singing
oh
the
dodo
once
lived
but
he
does
live
now
yet
why
should
a
cloud
overshadow
our
brow
the
loss
of
that
bird
should
trouble
our
brains
for
though
he
is
gone
still
our
claret
remains
sing
jolly
hurrah
in
his
name
let
our
cups
overflow
as
for
your
definition
doctor
continued
melick
i
give
you
one
worth
a
dozen
of
yours
was
a
mighty
bird
those
strong
short
legs
were
never
known
to
fail
and
he
felt
a
glory
of
pride
while
thinking
of
that
little
tail
and
his
beak
was
marked
with
vigor
curving
like
a
wondrous
hook
thick
and
ugly
was
his
body
such
a
form
as
made
one
look
melick
said
featherstone
you
a
volatile
youth
you
mind
him
doctor
he
a
professional
cynic
sceptic
and
scoffer
oxenden
and
i
however
are
open
to
conviction
and
want
to
know
more
about
those
birds
and
beasts
can
you
make
anything
out
of
the
opmahera
the
doctor
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
and
replied
oh
yes
there
are
many
birds
each
of
which
may
be
the
opmahera
there
the
fossil
bird
of
massachusetts
of
which
nothing
is
left
but
the
footprints
but
some
of
these
are
eighteen
inches
in
length
and
show
a
stride
of
two
yards
the
bird
belonged
to
the
order
of
the
grallae
and
may
have
been
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
height
then
there
is
the
gastornis
parisiensis
which
was
as
tall
as
an
ostrich
as
big
as
an
ox
and
belongs
to
the
same
order
as
the
other
then
there
is
the
palapteryx
of
which
remains
have
been
found
in
new
zealand
which
was
seven
or
eight
feet
in
height
but
the
one
which
to
my
mind
is
the
real
counterpart
of
the
opmahera
is
the
dinornis
gigantea
whose
remains
are
also
found
in
new
zealand
it
is
the
largest
bird
known
with
long
legs
a
long
neck
and
short
wings
useless
for
flight
one
specimen
that
has
been
found
is
upward
of
thirteen
feet
in
height
there
is
no
reason
why
some
should
not
have
been
much
taller
more
compares
its
height
to
that
of
a
giraffe
the
maoris
call
this
bird
the
moa
and
their
legends
and
traditions
are
full
of
mention
of
it
when
they
first
came
to
the
island
six
or
seven
hundred
years
ago
they
found
these
vast
birds
everywhere
and
hunted
them
for
food
to
my
mind
the
dinornis
is
the
opmahera
of
more
as
to
riding
on
them
that
is
likely
enough
for
ostriches
are
used
for
this
purpose
and
the
dinornis
must
have
been
far
stronger
and
fleeter
than
the
ostrich
it
is
possible
that
some
of
these
birds
may
still
be
living
in
the
remoter
parts
of
our
hemisphere
what
about
those
monsters
asked
featherstone
that
more
speaks
of
in
the
sacred
hunt
i
think
said
the
doctor
that
i
understand
pretty
well
what
they
were
and
can
identify
them
all
as
the
galley
passed
the
estuary
of
that
great
river
you
remember
that
he
mentions
seeing
them
on
the
shore
one
may
have
been
the
ichthyosaurus
this
as
the
name
implies
is
a
it
has
the
head
of
a
lizard
the
snout
of
a
dolphin
the
teeth
of
an
alligator
enormous
eyes
whose
membrane
is
strengthened
by
a
bony
frame
the
vertebrae
of
fishes
sternum
and
like
those
of
the
lizard
and
the
fins
of
a
whale
bayle
calls
it
the
whale
of
the
saurians
another
may
have
been
the
cheirotherium
on
account
of
the
marks
made
by
its
paws
owen
thinks
that
it
was
akin
to
the
frogs
but
it
was
a
formidable
monster
with
head
and
jaws
of
a
crocodile
another
may
have
been
the
teleosaurus
which
resembled
our
alligators
it
was
feet
in
length
then
there
was
the
hylaeosaurus
a
monster
feet
in
length
with
a
cuirass
of
bony
plates
but
none
of
these
correspond
with
more
description
of
the
monster
that
fought
with
the
galley
no
said
the
doctor
i
am
coming
to
that
now
that
monster
could
have
been
no
other
than
the
plesiosaurus
one
of
the
most
wonderful
animals
that
has
ever
existed
imagine
a
thing
with
the
head
of
a
lizard
the
teeth
of
a
crocodile
the
neck
of
a
swan
the
trunk
and
tail
of
a
quadruped
and
the
fins
of
a
whale
imagine
a
whale
with
its
head
and
neck
consisting
of
a
serpent
with
the
strength
of
the
former
and
the
malignant
fury
of
the
latter
and
then
you
will
have
the
plesiosaurus
it
was
an
aquatic
animal
yet
it
had
to
remain
near
or
on
the
surface
of
the
water
while
its
long
neck
enabled
it
to
reach
its
prey
above
or
below
with
swift
darts
yet
it
had
no
armor
and
could
not
have
been
at
all
a
match
for
the
ichthyosaurus
more
account
shows
however
that
it
was
a
fearful
enemy
for
man
to
encounter
he
seems
to
have
been
less
formidable
than
that
beast
which
they
encountered
in
the
swamp
have
you
any
idea
what
that
was
i
think
it
can
have
been
no
other
than
the
iguanodon
said
the
doctor
the
remains
of
this
animal
show
that
it
must
have
been
the
most
gigantic
of
all
primeval
saurians
judging
from
existing
remains
its
length
was
not
less
than
sixty
feet
and
larger
ones
may
have
existed
it
stood
high
on
its
legs
the
hind
ones
were
larger
than
the
fore
the
feet
were
massive
and
armed
with
tremendous
claws
it
lived
on
the
land
and
fed
on
herbage
it
had
a
horny
spiky
ridge
all
along
its
back
its
tail
was
nearly
as
long
as
its
body
its
head
was
short
its
jaws
enormous
furnished
with
teeth
of
a
very
elaborate
structure
and
on
its
muzzle
it
carried
a
curved
horn
such
a
beast
as
this
might
well
have
caused
all
that
destruction
of
life
on
the
part
of
his
desperate
assailants
of
which
more
speaks
then
there
was
another
animal
continued
the
doctor
who
was
evidently
discoursing
upon
a
favorite
topic
it
was
the
one
that
came
suddenly
upon
more
while
he
was
resting
with
almah
after
his
flight
with
the
bird
that
i
take
to
be
the
megalosaurus
this
animal
was
a
monster
of
tremendous
size
and
strength
cuvier
thought
that
it
might
have
been
seventy
feet
in
length
it
was
carnivorous
and
therefore
more
ferocious
than
the
iguanodon
and
more
ready
to
attack
its
head
was
like
that
of
a
crocodile
its
body
massive
like
that
of
an
elephant
yet
larger
its
tail
was
small
and
it
stood
high
on
its
legs
so
that
it
could
run
with
great
speed
it
was
not
covered
with
bony
armor
but
had
probably
a
hide
thick
enough
to
serve
the
purpose
of
shell
or
bone
its
teeth
were
constructed
so
as
to
cut
with
their
edges
and
the
movement
of
the
jaws
produced
the
combined
effect
of
knife
and
saw
while
their
inward
curve
rendered
impossible
the
escape
of
prey
that
had
once
been
caught
it
probably
frequented
the
river
banks
where
it
fed
upon
reptiles
of
smaller
size
which
inhabited
the
same
places
more
continued
the
doctor
is
too
general
in
his
descriptions
he
has
not
a
scientific
mind
and
he
gives
but
few
data
yet
i
can
bring
before
myself
very
easily
all
the
scenes
which
he
describes
particularly
that
one
in
which
the
megalosaurus
approaches
and
he
rushes
to
mount
the
dinoris
so
as
to
escape
i
see
that
river
with
its
trees
and
shrubs
all
unknown
now
except
in
museums
the
vegetation
of
the
coal
period
the
lepidodendron
the
lepidostrobus
the
pecopteris
the
neuropteris
the
lonchopteris
the
odontopteris
the
sphenopteris
the
cyclopteris
the
sigellaria
veniformis
the
sphenophyllium
the
calamites
melick
started
to
his
feet
there
there
he
cried
hold
hard
doctor
talking
of
calamities
what
greater
calamity
can
there
be
than
such
a
torrent
of
unknown
words
talk
english
doctor
and
we
shall
be
able
to
appreciate
you
but
to
make
your
jokes
your
conundrums
and
your
brilliant
witticisms
in
a
foreign
language
is
fair
to
us
and
does
no
credit
either
to
your
head
or
your
heart
the
doctor
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
took
no
notice
of
levity
all
these
stories
of
strange
animals
said
oxenden
may
be
very
interesting
doctor
but
i
must
say
that
i
am
far
more
struck
by
the
account
of
the
people
themselves
i
wonder
whether
they
are
an
aboriginal
race
or
descendants
of
the
same
stock
from
which
we
came
i
should
say
remarked
the
doctor
confidently
that
they
are
beyond
a
doubt
an
aboriginal
and
autochthonous
race
i
differ
from
you
altogether
said
oxenden
calmly
oh
said
the
doctor
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
their
complexion
small
stature
and
peculiar
eyes
their
love
of
darkness
their
singular
characteristics
both
physical
and
moral
all
go
to
show
that
they
can
have
no
connection
with
the
races
in
our
part
of
the
earth
their
peculiar
eyes
said
oxenden
are
no
doubt
produced
by
dwelling
in
caves
for
many
generations
on
the
contrary
said
the
doctor
it
is
their
peculiarity
of
eye
that
makes
them
dwell
in
caves
you
are
mistaking
the
cause
for
the
effect
doctor
not
at
all
it
is
you
who
are
making
that
mistake
it
the
old
debate
said
melick
as
the
poet
has
it
was
first
the
egg
or
the
hen
tell
me
i
pray
ye
learned
men
there
are
the
eyeless
fishes
of
the
great
cave
of
kentucky
said
oxenden
whose
eyes
have
become
extinct
from
living
in
the
dark
no
cried
the
doctor
the
fish
that
have
arisen
in
that
lake
have
never
needed
eyes
and
have
never
had
them
oxenden
laughed
well
said
he
i
discuss
the
question
with
you
on
different
grounds
altogether
and
i
will
show
clearly
that
these
men
these
bearded
men
must
belong
to
a
stock
that
is
nearly
related
to
our
own
or
at
least
that
they
belong
to
a
race
of
men
with
whom
we
are
all
very
familiar
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
you
try
it
said
the
doctor
very
well
said
oxenden
in
the
first
place
i
take
their
language
their
language
yes
more
has
given
us
very
many
words
in
their
language
now
he
himself
says
that
these
words
had
an
arabic
sound
he
was
slightly
acquainted
with
that
language
what
will
you
say
if
i
tell
you
that
these
words
are
still
more
like
hebrew
hebrew
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
amazement
yes
hebrew
said
oxenden
they
are
all
very
much
like
hebrew
words
and
the
difference
is
not
greater
than
that
which
exists
between
the
words
of
any
two
languages
of
the
aryan
family
oh
if
you
come
to
philology
i
throw
up
the
sponge
said
the
doctor
yet
i
should
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
on
that
point
the
languages
of
the
aryan
family
said
oxenden
have
the
same
general
characteristics
and
in
all
of
them
the
differences
that
exist
in
their
most
common
words
are
subject
to
the
action
of
a
regular
law
the
action
of
the
law
is
best
seen
in
the
changes
which
take
place
in
the
mutes
these
changes
are
indicated
in
a
summary
and
comprehensive
way
by
means
of
what
is
called
law
take
latin
and
english
for
instance
law
tells
us
among
other
things
that
in
latin
and
in
that
part
of
english
which
is
of
teutonic
origin
a
large
number
of
words
are
essentially
the
same
and
differ
merely
in
certain
phonetic
changes
take
the
word
in
latin
as
also
in
greek
it
is
now
the
latin
in
english
becomes
that
is
the
thin
mute
becomes
the
aspirated
mute
the
same
change
may
be
seen
in
the
latin
which
in
english
is
and
the
greek
pi
upsilon
rho
which
in
english
is
again
if
the
latin
or
greek
word
begins
with
an
aspirate
the
english
word
begins
with
a
medial
thus
the
latin
is
found
responsive
to
the
english
as
in
latin
english
latin
english
again
if
the
latin
or
greek
has
the
medial
the
english
has
the
thin
as
in
latin
english
latin
english
now
i
find
that
in
many
of
the
words
which
more
mentions
this
same
law
will
apply
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
if
they
were
spelled
with
perfect
accuracy
they
would
show
the
same
relation
between
the
kosekin
language
and
the
hebrew
that
there
is
between
the
saxon
english
and
the
latin
the
doctor
gave
a
heavy
sigh
you
out
of
my
depth
oxenden
said
he
i
nothing
of
a
philologist
by
jove
said
featherstone
i
like
this
this
is
equal
to
your
list
of
the
plants
of
the
coal
period
doctor
but
i
say
oxenden
while
you
are
about
it
why
do
you
give
us
a
little
dose
of
and
sanscrit
by
jove
the
fellow
has
bopp
by
heart
and
yet
he
expects
us
to
argue
with
him
i
have
it
cried
melick
the
kosekin
are
the
lost
ten
tribes
oxenden
is
feeling
his
way
to
that
he
is
going
to
make
them
out
to
be
all
hebrew
and
then
of
course
the
only
conclusion
will
be
that
they
are
the
ten
tribes
who
after
a
life
of
strange
vicissitudes
have
pulled
up
at
the
south
pole
it
a
wonder
more
did
think
of
that
or
the
writer
of
this
yarn
whoever
he
may
be
well
for
my
part
i
always
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
lost
ten
tribes
and
thought
them
a
fine
body
of
men
do
think
they
got
much
of
the
jew
about
them
said
featherstone
languidly
they
hate
riches
and
all
that
you
know
break
a
jew
heart
to
hear
of
all
that
property
wasted
and
money
going
not
a
bad
idea
though
that
of
theirs
about
money
too
much
money
a
howwid
baw
by
jove
well
continued
oxenden
calmly
resuming
and
taking
no
notice
of
these
interruptions
i
can
give
you
word
after
word
that
more
has
mentioned
which
corresponds
to
a
kindred
hebrew
word
in
accordance
with
law
for
instance
kosekin
hebrew
kosekin
hebrew
kosekin
hebrew
they
are
more
like
hebrew
than
arabic
just
as
words
are
more
like
latin
or
greek
than
sanscrit
hurrah
cried
melick
we
got
him
to
sanscrit
at
last
now
oxenden
my
boy
trot
out
the
the
dhuta
the
veda
quote
and
caedmon
gives
us
a
little
zeno
and
wind
up
with
rookh
in
modern
persian
so
i
conclude
said
oxenden
calmly
ignoring
melick
that
the
kosekin
are
a
semitic
people
their
complexion
and
their
beards
show
them
to
be
akin
to
the
caucasian
race
and
their
language
proves
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
they
belong
to
the
semitic
branch
of
that
race
it
is
impossible
for
an
autochthonous
people
to
have
such
a
language
but
how
cried
the
doctor
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
they
get
to
the
south
pole
easily
enough
interrupted
melick
shem
landed
there
from
ark
and
left
some
of
his
children
to
colonize
the
country
that
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
i
think
on
the
whole
that
this
idea
is
better
than
the
other
one
about
the
ten
tribes
at
any
rate
they
are
both
mine
and
i
warn
all
present
to
keep
their
hands
off
them
for
on
my
return
i
intend
to
take
out
a
copyright
there
another
thing
continued
oxenden
which
is
of
immense
importance
and
that
is
their
habit
of
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
resorted
to
at
first
from
some
hereditary
instinct
or
other
and
that
their
eyes
and
their
whole
morals
have
become
affected
by
this
mode
of
life
now
as
to
ornamented
caverns
we
have
many
examples
caverns
adorned
with
a
splendor
fully
equal
to
anything
among
the
kosekin
there
are
in
india
the
great
behar
caves
the
splendid
karli
temple
with
its
magnificent
sculptures
and
imposing
architecture
and
the
of
elephanta
there
are
the
subterranean
works
in
egypt
the
temple
of
dendera
in
particular
in
petra
we
have
the
case
of
an
entire
city
excavated
from
the
rocky
mountains
yet
after
all
these
do
not
bear
upon
the
point
in
question
for
they
are
isolated
cases
and
even
petra
though
it
contained
a
city
did
not
contain
a
nation
but
there
is
a
case
and
one
which
is
well
known
that
bears
directly
upon
this
question
and
gives
us
the
connecting
link
between
the
kosekin
and
their
semitic
brethren
in
the
northern
hemisphere
what
is
that
asked
the
doctor
the
troglodytes
said
oxenden
with
impressive
solemnity
well
and
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
troglodytes
i
will
explain
said
oxenden
the
name
troglodytes
is
given
to
various
tribes
of
men
but
those
best
known
and
celebrated
under
this
name
once
inhabited
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
both
on
the
arabian
and
the
egyptian
side
they
belonged
to
the
arabian
race
and
were
consequently
a
semitic
people
mark
that
for
it
is
a
point
of
the
utmost
importance
now
these
troglodytes
all
lived
in
caverns
which
were
formed
partly
by
art
and
partly
by
nature
although
art
must
have
had
most
to
do
with
the
construction
of
such
vast
subterranean
works
they
lived
in
great
communities
in
caverns
and
they
had
long
tunnels
passing
from
one
community
to
another
here
also
they
kept
their
cattle
some
of
these
people
have
survived
even
to
our
own
age
for
bruce
the
abyssinian
traveller
saw
them
in
nubia
the
earliest
writer
who
mentions
the
troglodytes
was
agatharcides
of
cnidos
according
to
him
they
were
chiefly
herdsmen
their
food
was
the
flesh
of
cattle
and
their
drink
a
mixture
of
milk
and
blood
they
dressed
in
the
skins
of
cattle
they
tattooed
their
bodies
they
were
very
swift
of
foot
and
were
able
to
run
down
wild
beasts
in
the
hunt
they
were
also
greatly
given
to
robbery
and
caravans
passing
to
and
fro
had
to
guard
against
them
one
feature
in
their
character
has
to
my
mind
a
strange
significance
and
that
is
their
feelings
with
regard
to
death
it
was
not
the
kosekin
love
of
death
yet
it
was
something
which
must
certainly
be
considered
as
approximating
to
it
for
agatharcides
says
that
in
their
burials
they
were
accustomed
to
fasten
the
corpse
to
a
stake
and
then
gathering
round
to
pelt
it
with
stones
amid
shouts
of
laughter
and
wild
merriment
they
also
used
to
strangle
the
old
and
infirm
so
as
to
deliver
them
from
the
evils
of
life
these
troglodytes
then
were
a
nation
of
loving
the
dark
not
exactly
loving
death
yet
at
any
rate
regarding
it
with
merriment
and
pleasure
and
so
i
can
not
help
seeing
a
connection
between
them
and
the
kosekin
yes
said
the
doctor
but
how
did
they
get
to
the
south
pole
that
said
oxenden
is
a
question
which
i
do
not
feel
bound
to
answer
oh
it
is
easy
enough
to
answer
that
said
melick
they
of
course
dug
through
the
earth
oxenden
gave
a
groan
i
think
i
turn
in
for
the
night
said
he
rising
upon
this
the
others
rose
also
and
followed
his
example
on
the
following
morning
the
calm
still
continued
none
of
the
party
rose
until
very
late
and
then
over
the
they
discussed
the
manuscript
once
more
each
from
his
own
point
of
view
melick
still
asserting
a
contemptuous
scepticism
oxenden
and
the
doctor
giving
reasons
for
their
faith
and
featherstone
listening
without
saying
much
on
either
side
at
length
it
was
proposed
to
resume
the
reading
of
the
manuscript
which
task
would
now
devolve
upon
oxenden
they
adjourned
to
the
deck
where
all
disposed
themselves
in
easy
attitudes
to
listen
to
the
continuation
of
more
narrative
chapter
xviii
a
voyage
over
the
pole
the
discovery
of
our
love
had
brought
a
crisis
in
our
fate
for
me
and
almah
the
kohen
hailed
it
with
joy
for
now
was
the
time
when
he
would
be
able
to
present
us
to
the
kohen
gadol
our
doom
was
certain
and
inevitable
we
were
to
be
taken
to
the
amir
we
were
to
be
kept
until
the
end
of
the
dark
season
and
then
we
were
both
to
be
publicly
sacrificed
after
this
our
bodies
were
to
be
set
apart
for
the
hideous
rites
of
the
mista
kosek
such
was
the
fate
that
lay
before
us
the
kohen
was
now
anxious
to
take
us
to
the
amir
i
might
possibly
have
persuaded
him
to
postpone
our
departure
but
i
saw
no
use
in
that
it
seemed
better
to
go
for
it
was
possible
that
amid
new
scenes
and
among
new
people
there
might
be
hope
this
too
seemed
probable
to
almah
who
was
quite
anxious
to
go
the
kohen
pressed
forward
the
preparations
and
at
length
a
galley
was
ready
for
us
this
galley
was
about
three
hundred
feet
in
length
and
fifty
in
width
but
not
more
than
six
feet
in
depth
it
was
like
a
long
raft
the
rowers
two
hundred
in
number
sat
on
a
level
with
the
water
one
hundred
on
each
side
the
oars
were
small
being
not
more
than
twelve
feet
in
length
but
made
of
very
light
tough
material
with
very
broad
blades
the
galley
was
steered
with
paddles
at
both
ends
there
was
no
mast
or
sail
astern
was
a
light
poop
surrounded
by
a
pavilion
and
forward
there
was
another
at
the
bow
there
was
a
projecting
platform
used
chiefly
in
fighting
the
thannin
or
and
also
in
war
there
were
no
masts
or
flags
or
gay
streamers
no
brilliant
colors
all
was
intensely
black
and
the
ornaments
were
of
the
same
hue
we
were
now
treated
with
greater
reverence
than
ever
for
we
were
looked
upon
as
the
recipients
of
the
highest
honor
that
could
fall
to
any
of
the
kosekin
namely
the
envied
dignity
of
a
public
death
as
we
embarked
the
whole
city
lined
the
public
ways
and
watched
us
from
the
quays
from
boats
and
from
other
galleys
songs
were
sung
by
a
chosen
choir
of
paupers
and
to
the
sound
of
this
plaintive
strain
we
moved
out
to
sea
this
will
be
a
great
journey
for
me
said
the
kohen
as
we
left
the
port
i
hope
to
be
made
a
pauper
at
least
and
perhaps
gain
the
honor
of
a
public
death
i
have
known
people
who
have
gained
death
for
less
there
was
an
athon
last
year
who
attacked
a
pehmet
with
forty
men
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
rowers
all
were
killed
or
drowned
except
himself
in
reward
for
this
he
gained
the
mudecheb
or
death
recompense
in
addition
to
this
he
was
set
apart
for
the
mista
kosek
then
with
you
when
a
man
procures
the
death
of
others
he
is
honored
why
yes
how
could
it
be
otherwise
said
the
kohen
is
it
not
the
same
with
you
have
you
not
told
me
incredible
things
about
your
people
among
which
there
were
a
few
that
seemed
natural
and
intelligible
among
these
was
your
system
of
honoring
above
all
men
those
who
procure
the
death
of
the
largest
number
you
with
your
pretended
fear
of
death
wish
to
meet
it
in
battle
as
eagerly
as
we
do
and
your
most
renowned
men
are
those
who
have
sent
most
to
death
to
this
strange
remark
i
had
no
answer
to
make
the
air
out
at
sea
now
grew
chillier
the
kohen
noticed
it
also
and
offered
me
his
cloak
which
i
refused
he
seemed
surprised
and
smiled
you
are
growing
like
one
of
us
said
he
you
will
soon
learn
that
the
greatest
happiness
in
life
is
to
do
good
to
others
and
sacrifice
yourself
you
already
show
this
in
part
when
you
are
with
almah
you
act
like
one
of
the
kosekin
you
watch
her
to
see
and
anticipate
her
slightest
wish
you
are
eager
to
give
her
everything
she
on
the
other
hand
is
equally
eager
to
give
up
all
to
you
each
one
of
you
is
willing
to
lay
down
life
for
the
other
you
would
gladly
rush
upon
death
to
save
her
from
harm
much
as
you
pretend
to
fear
death
and
so
i
see
that
with
almah
you
will
soon
learn
how
sweet
a
thing
death
may
be
to
live
without
her
said
i
would
be
so
bitter
that
death
with
her
would
indeed
be
sweet
if
i
could
save
her
life
by
laying
down
my
own
death
would
be
sweeter
still
and
not
one
of
you
kosekin
would
meet
it
so
gladly
the
kosekin
smiled
joyously
oh
almighty
and
wondrous
power
of
love
he
exclaimed
how
thou
hast
transformed
this
foreigner
oh
you
will
soon
be
one
of
us
altogether
for
see
how
is
it
now
you
pretend
to
love
riches
and
life
and
yet
you
are
ready
to
give
up
everything
for
almah
gladly
gladly
i
exclaimed
yes
he
said
all
that
you
have
you
would
gladly
lavish
on
her
and
would
rejoice
to
make
yourself
a
pauper
for
her
sweet
sake
you
also
would
rejoice
equally
to
give
up
life
for
her
is
it
not
so
it
is
said
i
then
i
see
by
this
that
almah
has
awakened
within
you
your
true
human
nature
thus
far
it
has
lain
dormant
it
has
been
concealed
under
a
thousand
false
and
unnatural
habits
arising
from
your
strange
native
customs
you
have
been
brought
up
under
some
frightful
system
where
nature
is
violated
here
among
us
your
true
humanity
is
unfolded
and
with
almah
you
are
like
the
kosekin
soon
you
will
learn
new
lessons
and
will
find
out
that
there
is
a
new
and
a
final
in
perfect
love
and
your
love
will
never
rest
till
you
have
separated
yourself
from
almah
so
that
love
can
have
its
perfect
work
the
sea
now
opened
wide
before
us
rising
up
high
as
if
to
the
zenith
giving
the
impression
of
a
vast
ascent
to
endless
distances
around
the
shores
spread
themselves
with
the
shadowy
outlines
of
the
mountains
above
was
the
sky
all
clear
with
faint
and
gleaming
stars
with
almah
i
stood
and
pointed
out
the
constellations
as
we
marked
them
while
she
told
me
of
the
different
divisions
known
among
the
kosekin
as
well
as
her
own
people
there
high
in
the
zenith
was
the
southern
not
exactly
at
the
pole
nor
yet
of
very
great
brightness
but
still
sufficiently
noticeable
looking
back
we
saw
low
down
parts
of
the
phoenix
and
the
crane
higher
up
the
toucan
hydrus
and
pavo
on
our
right
low
down
was
the
beautiful
altar
higher
up
the
triangle
while
on
the
left
were
the
and
the
turning
to
look
forward
we
beheld
a
more
splendid
display
then
over
the
bow
of
the
vessel
between
the
centaur
which
lay
low
and
musca
indica
which
rose
high
there
blazed
the
bright
stars
of
the
southern
cross
a
constellation
if
not
the
brightest
at
least
the
most
conspicuous
and
attractive
in
all
the
heavens
all
around
there
burned
other
stars
separated
widely
then
over
the
stern
gleamed
the
splendid
lustre
of
achernar
on
the
left
the
brilliant
glow
of
alpha
robur
and
canopus
and
low
down
before
us
the
bright
light
of
argo
it
was
a
scene
full
of
splendor
and
fascination
after
a
time
a
change
came
over
the
sky
the
at
first
faint
gradually
increased
in
brilliancy
till
the
stars
grew
dim
and
all
the
sky
wherever
the
eye
might
turn
from
the
horizon
to
the
zenith
seemed
filled
with
lustrous
flames
of
every
conceivable
hue
colossal
beams
radiated
from
the
pole
toward
the
horizon
till
the
central
light
was
dissipated
and
there
remained
encircling
us
an
infinite
colonnade
of
flaming
pillars
that
towered
to
the
stars
these
were
all
in
motion
running
upon
one
another
incessantly
shifting
and
changing
new
scenes
forever
succeeded
to
old
pillars
were
transformed
to
pyramids
pyramids
to
fiery
bars
these
in
their
turn
were
transformed
to
other
shapes
and
all
the
while
one
tint
of
innumerable
hues
overspread
the
entire
circle
of
the
sky
our
voyage
occupied
several
joms
but
our
progress
was
continuous
for
different
sets
of
rowers
relieved
one
another
at
regular
intervals
on
the
second
jom
a
storm
broke
out
the
sky
had
been
gathering
clouds
during
and
when
we
awoke
we
found
the
sea
all
lashed
to
fury
while
all
around
the
darkness
was
intense
the
storm
grew
steadily
worse
the
lightning
flashed
the
thunder
pealed
and
at
length
the
sea
was
so
heavy
that
rowing
was
impossible
upon
this
the
oars
were
all
taken
in
and
the
galley
lay
tossing
upon
the
furious
sea
amid
waves
that
continually
beat
upon
her
and
now
a
scene
ensued
that
filled
me
with
amazement
and
took
away
all
my
thoughts
from
the
storm
it
seemed
impossible
that
so
frail
a
bark
could
stand
the
fury
of
the
waves
destruction
was
inevitable
and
i
was
expecting
to
see
the
usual
signs
of
grief
and
despair
wondering
too
how
these
rowers
would
preserve
their
subordination
but
i
had
forgotten
in
my
excitement
the
strange
nature
of
the
kosekin
instead
of
terror
there
was
joy
instead
of
wild
despair
there
was
peace
and
serene
delight
the
revealed
a
wonderful
scene
there
were
all
the
rowers
each
one
upon
his
seat
and
from
them
all
there
came
forth
a
chant
which
was
full
of
triumph
like
a
song
of
public
welcome
to
some
great
national
hero
or
a
song
of
joy
over
victory
the
officers
embraced
one
another
and
exchanged
words
of
delight
the
kohen
after
embracing
all
the
others
turned
to
me
and
forgetting
my
foreign
ways
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
enthusiastic
delight
we
are
destroyed
death
is
near
rejoice
accustomed
as
i
was
to
the
perils
of
the
sea
i
had
learned
to
face
death
without
flinching
almah
too
was
calm
for
to
her
this
death
seemed
preferable
to
that
darker
fate
which
awaited
us
but
the
words
of
the
kohen
jarred
upon
my
feelings
do
you
not
intend
to
do
anything
to
save
the
ship
i
asked
he
laughed
joyously
there
no
occasion
said
he
when
the
oars
are
taken
in
we
always
begin
to
rejoice
and
why
not
death
is
near
it
is
almost
certain
why
should
we
do
anything
to
distract
our
minds
and
mar
our
joy
for
oh
dear
friend
the
glorious
time
has
come
when
we
can
give
up
life
life
with
all
its
toils
its
burdens
its
endless
bitternesses
its
perpetual
evils
now
we
shall
have
no
more
suffering
from
vexatious
and
oppressive
riches
from
troublesome
honors
from
a
surplus
of
food
from
luxuries
and
delicacies
and
all
the
ills
of
life
but
what
is
the
use
of
being
born
at
all
i
asked
in
a
wonder
that
never
ceased
to
rise
at
every
fresh
display
of
kosekin
feeling
the
use
said
the
kohen
why
if
we
were
not
born
how
could
we
know
the
bliss
of
dying
or
enjoy
the
sweetness
of
death
death
is
the
end
of
being
the
one
sweet
hope
and
crown
and
glory
of
life
the
one
desire
and
hope
of
every
living
man
the
blessing
is
denied
to
none
rejoice
with
me
oh
you
will
soon
know
its
blessedness
as
well
as
i
he
turned
away
i
held
almah
in
my
arms
and
we
watched
the
storm
by
the
and
waited
for
the
end
but
the
end
came
not
the
galley
was
light
broad
and
buoyant
as
a
at
the
same
time
it
was
so
strongly
constructed
that
there
was
scarcely
any
twist
or
contortion
in
the
sinewy
fabric
so
we
floated
buoyantly
and
safely
upon
the
summit
of
vast
waves
and
a
storm
that
would
have
destroyed
a
ship
of
the
european
fashion
scarcely
injured
this
in
the
slightest
degree
it
was
an
indestructible
as
a
raft
and
as
buoyant
as
a
bubble
so
we
rode
out
the
gale
and
the
death
which
the
kosekin
invoked
did
not
come
at
all
the
storm
was
but
the
clouds
dispersed
and
soon
went
scudding
over
the
sky
the
sea
went
down
the
rowers
had
to
take
their
oars
once
more
and
the
reaction
that
followed
upon
their
recent
rejoicing
was
visible
in
universal
gloom
and
dejection
as
the
clouds
dispersed
the
aurora
lights
came
out
more
splendid
than
ever
and
showed
nothing
but
melancholy
faces
the
rowers
pulled
with
no
life
or
animation
the
officers
stood
about
sighing
and
lamenting
almah
and
i
were
the
only
ones
that
rejoiced
over
this
escape
from
death
joms
passed
we
saw
other
sights
we
met
with
galleys
and
saw
many
ships
about
the
sea
some
were
moved
by
sails
only
these
were
merchant
ships
but
they
had
only
square
sails
and
could
not
sail
in
any
other
way
than
before
the
wind
once
or
twice
i
caught
glimpses
of
vast
shadowy
objects
in
the
air
i
was
startled
and
terrified
for
great
as
were
the
wonders
of
this
strange
region
i
had
not
yet
suspected
that
the
air
itself
might
have
denizens
as
tremendous
as
the
land
or
the
sea
yet
so
it
was
and
afterward
during
the
voyage
i
saw
them
often
one
in
particular
was
so
near
that
i
observed
it
with
ease
it
came
flying
along
in
the
same
course
with
us
at
a
height
of
about
fifty
feet
from
the
water
it
was
a
frightful
monster
with
a
long
body
and
vast
wings
like
those
a
bat
its
progress
was
swift
and
it
soon
passed
out
of
sight
to
almah
the
monster
created
no
surprise
she
was
familiar
with
them
and
told
me
that
they
were
very
abundant
here
but
that
they
never
were
known
to
attack
ships
she
informed
me
that
they
were
capable
of
being
tamed
if
caught
when
young
though
in
her
country
they
were
never
made
use
of
the
name
given
by
the
kosekin
to
these
monsters
is
athaleb
at
length
we
drew
near
to
our
destination
we
reached
a
large
harbor
at
the
end
of
a
vast
bay
here
the
mountains
extended
around
and
before
us
there
arose
terrace
after
terrace
of
twinkling
lights
running
away
to
immense
distances
it
looked
like
a
city
of
a
million
inhabitants
though
it
may
have
contained
far
less
than
that
by
the
brilliant
aurora
light
i
could
see
that
it
was
in
general
shape
and
form
precisely
like
the
city
that
we
had
left
though
far
larger
and
more
populous
the
harbor
was
full
of
ships
and
boats
of
all
sorts
some
lying
at
the
stone
quays
others
leaving
port
others
entering
galleys
passed
and
repassed
and
merchant
ships
with
their
clumsy
sails
and
small
from
afar
arose
the
deep
hum
of
a
vast
multitude
and
the
low
roar
that
always
ascends
from
a
popular
city
the
galley
hauled
alongside
her
wharf
and
we
found
ourselves
at
length
in
the
mighty
amir
of
the
kosekin
the
kohen
alone
landed
the
rest
remained
on
board
and
almah
and
i
with
them
other
galleys
were
here
on
the
wharf
workmen
were
moving
about
just
beyond
were
caverns
that
looked
like
warehouses
above
these
was
a
terraced
street
where
a
vast
multitude
moved
to
and
fro
a
living
tide
as
crowded
and
as
busy
as
that
in
cheapside
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
the
kohen
returned
this
time
he
came
with
a
number
of
people
all
of
whom
were
in
cars
drawn
by
opkuks
half
were
men
and
half
women
these
came
aboard
and
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
to
be
separated
for
the
women
took
almah
while
the
men
took
me
upon
this
i
entreated
the
kohen
not
to
separate
us
i
informed
him
that
we
were
both
of
a
different
race
from
his
that
we
did
not
understand
their
ways
we
should
be
miserable
if
separated
i
spoke
long
and
with
all
the
entreaty
possible
to
one
with
my
limited
acquaintance
with
the
language
my
words
evidently
impressed
them
some
of
them
even
wept
you
make
us
sad
said
the
kohen
willingly
would
we
do
everything
that
you
bid
for
we
are
your
slaves
but
the
state
law
prevents
still
in
your
case
the
law
will
be
modified
for
you
are
in
such
honor
here
that
you
may
be
considered
as
beyond
the
laws
for
the
present
at
least
we
can
not
separate
you
these
words
brought
much
consolation
after
this
we
landed
and
almah
and
i
were
still
together
chapter
xix
the
wonders
of
the
amir
we
were
drawn
on
cars
up
to
the
first
terraced
street
and
here
we
found
the
vast
multitude
which
we
had
seen
from
a
distance
crossing
this
street
we
ascended
and
came
to
another
precisely
like
it
then
still
going
on
we
came
to
a
third
here
there
was
an
immense
space
not
overgrown
with
trees
like
the
streets
but
perfectly
open
in
the
midst
arose
a
lofty
pyramid
and
as
i
looked
at
it
i
could
not
refrain
from
shuddering
for
it
looked
like
the
public
altar
upon
which
in
due
time
i
should
be
compelled
to
make
my
appearance
and
be
offered
up
as
a
victim
to
the
terrific
superstitions
of
the
kosekin
crossing
this
great
square
we
came
to
a
vast
portal
which
opened
into
a
cavern
with
twinkling
lights
the
city
itself
extended
above
this
for
we
could
see
the
terraced
streets
rising
above
our
heads
but
here
our
progress
ended
at
the
great
cavern
in
the
chief
square
opposite
the
pyramid
on
entering
the
cavern
we
traversed
an
antechamber
and
then
passing
on
we
reached
a
vast
dome
of
dimensions
so
great
that
i
could
perceive
no
end
in
that
gloom
the
twinkling
lights
served
only
to
disclose
the
darkness
and
to
indicate
the
immensity
of
the
cavern
in
the
midst
there
arose
two
enormous
columns
which
were
lost
in
the
gloom
above
it
was
only
by
passing
through
this
that
we
learned
its
great
extent
we
at
length
came
to
the
other
end
and
here
we
saw
numerous
passages
leading
away
the
kohen
led
us
through
one
of
these
and
after
passing
through
several
other
domes
of
smaller
dimensions
we
at
length
reached
an
apartment
where
we
stopped
this
place
was
furnished
with
couches
and
hangings
and
lighted
with
flaming
lamps
the
light
was
distressing
to
those
who
had
accompanied
us
and
many
of
them
left
while
the
few
who
remained
had
to
cover
their
eyes
here
we
found
that
all
preparations
had
been
made
the
apartments
were
all
illuminated
though
our
love
of
light
never
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
amazement
to
the
kosekin
and
a
bounteous
repast
was
spread
for
us
but
the
kohen
and
the
others
found
the
light
intolerable
and
soon
left
us
to
ourselves
after
the
repast
some
women
appeared
to
take
almah
to
her
chamber
and
with
the
usual
kindness
of
the
kosekin
they
assured
her
that
she
would
not
be
expected
to
obey
the
law
of
separation
but
that
she
was
to
remain
here
where
she
would
be
always
within
reach
of
me
after
her
departure
there
came
to
visit
me
the
lowest
man
in
all
the
land
of
the
kosekin
though
according
to
our
view
he
would
be
esteemed
the
highest
this
was
the
kohen
gadol
his
history
had
already
been
told
me
i
had
learned
that
through
lack
of
kosekin
virtue
he
had
gradually
sunk
to
this
position
and
now
was
compelled
to
hold
in
his
hands
more
wealth
power
and
display
than
any
other
man
in
the
nation
he
was
a
man
of
singular
appearance
the
light
was
not
so
troublesome
to
him
as
to
the
others
he
merely
kept
his
eyes
shaded
but
he
regarded
me
with
a
keen
look
of
inquiry
that
was
suggestive
of
shrewdness
and
cunning
i
confess
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
i
made
this
discovery
for
i
longed
to
find
someone
among
this
singular
people
who
was
selfish
who
feared
death
who
loved
life
who
loved
riches
and
had
something
in
common
with
me
this
i
thought
i
perceived
in
the
shrewd
cunning
face
of
the
kohen
gadol
and
i
was
glad
for
i
saw
that
while
he
could
not
possibly
be
more
dangerous
to
me
than
those
cannibals
whom
i
had
thus
far
known
he
might
prove
of
some
assistance
and
might
help
me
to
devise
means
of
escape
if
i
could
only
find
someone
who
was
a
coward
and
selfish
and
avaricious
if
this
kohen
gadol
could
but
be
he
how
much
brighter
my
life
would
be
and
so
there
happened
to
me
an
incredible
thing
that
my
highest
wish
was
now
to
find
in
the
kohen
gadol
cowardice
avarice
and
selfishness
the
kohen
was
accompanied
by
a
young
female
richly
attired
who
i
afterward
learned
was
his
daughter
her
name
was
layelah
and
she
filled
the
office
of
malca
which
signifies
queen
and
though
honorable
with
us
above
all
is
among
the
kosekin
the
lowest
in
the
land
layelah
was
so
beautiful
that
i
looked
at
her
in
amazement
she
was
very
tall
for
one
of
the
kosekin
which
made
her
stature
equal
to
that
of
an
ordinary
girl
with
us
her
hair
was
rich
dark
and
luxuriant
gathered
about
her
head
in
great
masses
and
bound
by
a
golden
band
her
features
were
delicate
and
perfect
in
their
outline
her
expression
was
noble
and
commanding
her
eyes
were
utterly
unlike
those
of
the
other
kosekin
the
upper
lids
had
a
slight
droop
but
that
was
all
and
that
was
the
nearest
approach
to
the
national
blink
her
first
entrance
into
the
room
seemed
to
dazzle
her
and
she
shaded
her
eyes
for
a
few
moments
but
after
that
she
looked
at
me
fixedly
and
seemed
to
suffer
no
more
inconvenience
than
i
did
the
perfect
liberty
of
women
among
the
kosekin
made
this
visit
from
her
quite
as
natural
as
that
of
her
father
and
though
she
said
but
little
on
this
occasion
she
was
an
attentive
listener
and
close
observer
their
visit
was
long
for
they
were
evidently
full
of
curiosity
they
had
heard
much
about
me
and
wished
to
see
more
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
found
among
the
kosekin
the
slightest
desire
to
know
where
i
had
come
from
hitherto
all
had
been
content
with
the
knowledge
that
i
was
a
foreigner
now
however
i
found
in
the
kohen
gadol
and
layelah
a
curiosity
that
was
most
eager
and
intense
they
questioned
me
about
my
country
about
the
great
world
beyond
the
mountains
about
the
way
in
which
i
had
come
here
about
the
manners
and
customs
of
my
countrymen
they
were
eager
to
know
about
those
great
nations
of
which
i
spoke
who
loved
light
and
life
about
men
who
loved
themselves
better
than
others
of
that
world
where
men
feared
death
and
loved
life
and
sought
after
riches
and
lived
in
the
light
the
came
and
passed
and
my
visitors
were
still
full
of
eager
questionings
it
was
layelah
who
at
last
thought
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
at
a
word
from
her
the
kohen
gadol
rose
with
many
apologies
and
prepared
to
go
but
before
he
left
he
said
when
i
was
a
child
i
was
shipwrecked
and
was
taken
up
a
ship
which
conveyed
me
to
a
nation
beyond
the
sea
there
i
grew
up
to
manhood
i
learned
their
language
and
manners
and
customs
and
when
i
returned
home
i
found
myself
an
alien
here
i
do
not
love
darkness
or
death
i
do
not
hate
riches
and
the
result
is
that
i
am
what
i
am
if
i
were
like
the
rest
of
my
countrymen
my
lot
would
make
me
miserable
but
as
it
is
i
prefer
it
to
any
other
and
consider
myself
not
the
lowest
but
the
greatest
in
the
land
my
daughter
is
like
me
and
instead
of
being
ashamed
of
her
station
she
is
proud
of
it
and
would
not
give
it
up
even
to
become
a
pauper
i
will
see
you
again
i
have
much
to
say
with
these
words
the
kohen
gadol
retired
followed
by
layelah
leaving
me
more
hopeful
than
i
had
been
for
a
long
time
for
many
joms
following
i
received
visits
from
the
kohen
gadol
and
from
layelah
almah
was
with
me
until
and
then
these
other
visitors
would
come
in
this
at
least
they
resembled
the
other
kosekin
that
they
never
dreamed
of
interfering
with
almah
when
she
might
wish
to
be
with
me
their
visits
were
always
long
and
we
had
much
to
say
but
what
i
lost
of
sleep
i
always
made
up
on
the
following
jom
the
kohen
gadol
with
his
keen
shrewd
face
interested
me
greatly
but
layelah
with
her
proud
face
and
air
of
command
was
a
positive
wonder
i
soon
learned
that
the
kohen
gadol
was
what
we
term
a
man
of
advanced
views
or
perhaps
a
reformer
or
a
philosophic
radical
it
matters
not
which
suffice
it
to
say
that
his
ideas
and
feelings
differed
from
those
of
his
nation
and
if
carried
out
would
be
equal
to
a
revolution
in
politics
and
morals
the
kohen
gadol
advocated
selfishness
as
the
true
law
of
life
without
which
no
state
can
prosper
there
were
a
few
of
similar
views
but
they
were
all
regarded
with
great
contempt
by
the
multitude
and
had
to
suffer
the
utmost
rigor
of
the
law
for
they
were
all
endowed
with
vast
wealth
compelled
to
live
in
the
utmost
splendor
and
luxury
to
have
enormous
retinues
and
to
wield
the
chief
power
in
politics
and
in
religion
even
this
however
had
not
changed
the
sentiments
of
the
condemned
and
i
learned
that
they
were
laboring
incessantly
notwithstanding
their
severe
punishment
to
disseminate
their
peculiar
doctrines
these
were
formulated
as
follows
a
man
should
not
love
others
better
than
himself
life
is
not
an
evil
to
be
got
rid
of
other
things
are
to
be
preferred
to
death
poverty
is
not
the
best
state
for
man
unrequited
love
is
not
the
greatest
happiness
lovers
may
sometimes
marry
to
serve
is
not
more
honorable
than
to
command
defeat
is
not
more
glorious
than
victory
to
save
a
life
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
criminal
offence
the
paupers
should
be
forced
to
take
a
certain
amount
of
wealth
to
relieve
the
necessities
of
the
rich
these
articles
were
considered
both
by
the
kohen
gadol
and
by
layelah
to
be
remarkable
for
their
audacity
and
were
altogether
too
advanced
for
mention
by
any
except
the
chosen
few
with
the
multitude
he
had
to
deal
differently
and
had
to
work
his
way
by
concealing
his
opinions
he
had
made
a
great
conspiracy
in
which
he
was
still
engaged
and
had
gained
immense
numbers
of
adherents
by
allowing
them
to
give
him
their
whole
wealth
through
his
assistance
many
athons
and
kohens
and
meleks
had
become
artisans
laborers
and
even
paupers
but
all
were
bound
by
him
to
the
strictest
secrecy
if
anyone
should
divulge
the
secret
it
would
be
ruin
to
him
and
to
many
others
for
they
would
at
once
be
punished
by
the
bestowal
of
the
extremest
wealth
by
degradation
to
the
rank
of
rulers
and
commanders
and
by
the
severest
rigors
of
luxury
power
splendor
and
magnificence
known
among
the
kosekin
overwhelmed
thus
with
the
cares
of
government
crushed
under
the
weight
of
authority
and
autocratic
rule
surrounded
by
countless
slaves
all
ready
to
die
for
them
their
lives
would
be
embittered
and
their
punishment
would
be
more
than
they
could
bear
but
the
philosophic
kohen
gadol
dared
all
these
punishments
and
pursued
his
way
calmly
and
pertinaciously
nothing
surprised
the
kohen
gadol
so
much
as
the
manner
in
which
i
received
his
confidences
he
half
expected
to
startle
me
by
his
boldness
but
was
himself
confounded
by
my
words
i
told
him
that
in
my
country
self
was
the
chief
consideration
the
law
of
nature
death
the
king
of
terrors
wealth
the
object
of
universal
search
poverty
the
worst
of
evils
unrequited
love
nothing
less
than
anguish
and
despair
to
command
others
the
highest
glory
victory
honor
defeat
intolerable
shame
and
other
things
of
the
same
sort
all
of
which
sounded
in
his
ears
as
he
said
with
such
tremendous
force
that
they
were
like
peals
of
thunder
he
shook
his
head
despondently
he
could
not
believe
that
such
views
as
mine
could
ever
be
attained
to
among
the
kosekin
but
layelah
was
bolder
and
with
all
a
woman
impetuosity
grasped
at
my
fullest
meaning
and
held
it
firm
he
is
right
said
layelah
the
he
shall
be
our
teacher
the
rich
shall
be
esteemed
the
poor
shall
be
to
rule
over
others
shall
be
glorious
to
serve
shall
be
base
victory
shall
be
an
honor
defeat
a
shame
selfishness
luxury
and
indulgence
shall
be
virtues
poverty
want
and
squalor
shall
be
things
of
abhorrence
and
contempt
the
face
of
layelah
glowed
with
enthusiasm
as
she
said
these
words
and
i
saw
in
her
a
daring
intrepid
and
woman
full
of
a
woman
headlong
impetuosity
and
disregard
of
consequences
in
me
she
saw
one
who
seemed
to
her
like
a
prophet
and
teacher
of
a
new
order
of
things
and
her
whole
soul
responded
to
the
principles
which
i
announced
it
required
immense
strength
of
mind
and
firmness
of
soul
to
separate
herself
from
the
prevalent
sentiment
of
her
nation
and
though
nature
had
done
much
for
her
in
giving
her
a
larger
portion
of
original
selfishness
than
was
common
to
her
people
still
she
was
a
child
of
the
kosekin
and
her
daring
was
all
the
more
remarkable
and
so
she
went
further
than
her
father
and
adopted
my
extreme
views
when
he
shrank
back
and
dared
more
unflinchingly
the
extremest
rigors
of
the
national
law
and
all
that
the
kosekin
could
inflict
in
the
way
of
wealth
luxury
supreme
command
palatial
abodes
vast
retinues
of
slaves
and
the
immense
degradation
of
the
queenly
office
i
spoke
to
her
in
a
warning
voice
about
her
rashness
oh
said
she
i
have
counted
the
cost
and
am
ready
to
accept
all
that
they
can
inflict
i
embrace
the
good
cause
and
will
not
give
it
up
no
not
even
if
they
could
increase
my
wealth
a
and
sentence
me
to
live
a
hundred
seasons
i
can
bear
their
utmost
inflictions
of
wealth
power
magnificence
i
could
even
bear
being
condemned
to
live
forever
in
the
light
oh
my
friend
it
is
the
conviction
of
right
and
the
support
of
conscience
that
strengthens
one
to
bear
the
greatest
evils
that
man
can
inflict
from
these
words
it
was
evident
to
me
that
layelah
was
a
true
child
of
the
kosekin
for
though
she
was
of
advanced
sentiments
she
still
used
the
language
of
her
people
and
spoke
of
the
punishments
of
the
law
as
though
they
were
punishments
in
reality
now
to
me
and
to
almah
these
punishments
seemed
rewards
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
avoid
feeling
a
very
strong
regard
for
this
enthusiastic
and
beautiful
girl
all
the
more
indeed
because
she
evinced
such
an
undisguised
admiration
for
me
she
evidently
considered
me
some
superior
being
from
some
superior
race
and
although
my
broken
and
faulty
way
of
speaking
the
language
was
something
of
a
trial
still
she
seemed
to
consider
every
word
i
uttered
as
a
maxim
of
the
highest
wisdom
the
tritest
of
truths
the
commonest
of
platitudes
the
most
familiar
of
proverbs
or
old
saws
current
among
us
were
eagerly
seized
by
layelah
and
accepted
as
truths
almost
divine
as
new
doctrines
for
the
guidance
of
the
human
race
these
she
would
discuss
with
me
she
would
put
them
into
better
and
more
striking
language
and
ask
for
my
opinion
then
she
would
write
them
down
for
the
kosekin
knew
the
art
of
writing
they
had
an
alphabet
of
their
own
which
was
at
once
simple
and
very
scientific
there
were
no
vowels
but
only
consonant
sounds
the
vowels
being
supplied
in
reading
just
as
if
one
should
write
the
words
fthr
or
dghtr
and
read
them
father
and
daughter
their
letters
were
as
follows
p
k
t
b
g
d
f
ch
th
m
l
n
s
h
there
were
also
three
others
which
have
no
equivalents
in
english
it
soon
became
evident
to
me
that
layelah
had
a
complete
ascendancy
over
her
father
that
she
was
not
only
the
malca
of
the
amir
but
the
presiding
spirit
and
the
chief
administrative
genius
of
the
whole
nation
of
the
kosekin
she
seemed
to
be
a
new
semiramis
one
who
might
revolutionize
an
empire
and
introduce
a
new
order
of
things
such
indeed
was
her
high
ambition
and
she
plainly
avowed
it
to
me
but
what
was
more
she
frankly
informed
me
that
she
regarded
me
as
a
teacher
as
one
who
in
this
darkness
could
tell
her
of
the
nations
of
light
who
could
instruct
her
in
the
wisdom
of
other
and
greater
races
and
help
her
to
accomplish
her
grand
designs
as
for
almah
she
seemed
quite
beneath
the
notice
of
the
aspiring
layelah
she
never
noticed
her
she
never
spoke
of
her
and
she
always
made
her
visits
to
me
after
almah
had
gone
chapter
xx
the
dark
maiden
layelah
layelah
at
length
began
to
make
pointed
remarks
about
almah
she
loves
you
said
she
and
you
love
her
how
is
it
that
you
do
not
give
each
other
up
i
would
die
rather
than
give
up
almah
said
layelah
smiled
that
sounds
strange
to
the
kosekin
said
she
for
here
to
give
up
your
love
and
to
die
are
both
esteemed
the
greatest
possible
blessings
but
almah
should
give
you
up
it
is
the
women
with
us
who
make
the
beginning
women
generally
fall
in
love
first
and
it
is
expected
that
they
will
tell
their
love
first
the
delicacy
of
a
woman
feelings
makes
this
natural
for
if
a
man
tells
his
love
to
a
woman
who
does
not
love
him
it
shocks
her
modesty
while
if
a
woman
tells
a
man
he
has
no
modesty
to
shock
that
is
strange
said
i
but
suppose
the
man
does
not
love
the
woman
why
no
woman
wants
to
be
loved
she
only
wants
to
love
at
this
i
felt
somewhat
bewildered
that
said
layelah
is
unrequited
love
which
is
the
chief
blessing
here
though
for
my
part
i
am
a
philosopher
and
would
wish
when
i
love
to
be
loved
in
return
and
then
said
i
if
so
would
you
give
up
your
lover
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
your
country
layelah
dark
eyes
rested
on
me
for
a
moment
with
a
glance
of
intense
earnestness
and
profound
meaning
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
said
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
never
layelah
was
constantly
with
me
and
at
length
used
to
come
at
an
earlier
time
when
almah
was
present
her
manner
toward
almah
was
full
of
the
usual
kosekin
courtesy
and
gracious
cordiality
she
was
still
intent
upon
learning
from
me
the
manners
customs
and
principles
of
action
of
the
race
to
which
i
belonged
she
had
an
insatiable
thirst
for
knowledge
and
her
curiosity
extended
to
all
of
those
great
inventions
which
are
the
wonder
of
christendom
locomotives
and
steamboats
were
described
to
her
under
the
names
of
horses
of
fire
and
ships
of
fire
printing
was
letters
of
power
the
electric
telegraph
messages
of
lightning
the
organ
lute
of
giants
and
so
on
yet
in
spite
of
the
eagerness
with
which
she
made
her
inquiries
and
the
diligence
with
which
she
noted
all
down
i
could
see
that
there
was
in
her
mind
something
lying
beneath
it
all
a
far
more
earnest
purpose
and
a
far
more
personal
one
than
the
pursuit
of
useful
knowledge
layelah
was
watchful
of
almah
she
seemed
studying
her
to
see
how
far
this
woman
of
another
race
differed
from
the
kosekin
she
would
often
turn
from
me
and
talk
with
almah
for
a
long
time
questioning
her
about
her
people
and
their
ways
almah
manner
was
somewhat
reserved
and
it
was
rendered
somewhat
more
so
from
the
fact
that
her
mind
was
always
full
of
the
prospect
of
our
impending
doom
each
jom
as
it
came
and
went
brought
us
nearer
to
that
awful
time
and
the
hour
was
surely
coming
when
we
should
be
taken
to
the
outer
square
and
to
the
top
of
the
pyramid
of
sacrifice
once
layelah
sat
for
some
time
silent
and
involved
in
thought
at
length
she
began
to
speak
to
me
almah
said
she
is
very
different
from
us
she
loves
you
and
you
love
her
she
ought
to
give
you
up
almah
you
ought
to
give
up
since
you
love
him
almah
looked
confused
and
made
some
reply
to
the
effect
that
she
belonged
to
a
different
race
with
different
customs
but
you
should
follow
our
customs
you
are
one
of
us
now
you
can
easily
find
another
who
will
take
him
almah
threw
a
piteous
glance
at
me
and
said
nothing
i
said
layelah
will
take
him
she
spoke
these
words
with
an
air
of
magnanimity
as
though
putting
it
in
the
light
of
a
favor
to
almah
but
almah
did
not
make
any
reply
and
after
some
silence
layelah
spoke
of
something
else
not
long
after
we
were
alone
together
and
layelah
returned
to
the
subject
she
referred
to
almah
want
of
sympathy
with
the
manners
of
the
kosekin
and
asserted
that
she
ought
to
aim
after
a
separation
i
love
her
said
i
with
great
warmth
and
will
never
give
her
up
but
she
must
give
you
up
it
is
the
woman
place
to
take
the
first
step
i
should
be
willing
to
take
you
as
layelah
said
this
she
looked
at
me
very
earnestly
as
if
anxious
to
see
how
i
accepted
this
offer
it
was
for
me
a
most
embarrassing
moment
i
loved
almah
but
layelah
also
was
most
agreeable
and
i
liked
her
very
much
indeed
so
much
so
that
i
could
not
bear
to
say
anything
that
might
hurt
her
feelings
among
all
the
kosekin
there
was
not
one
who
was
not
infinitely
inferior
to
her
in
my
eyes
still
i
loved
almah
and
i
told
her
so
again
thinking
that
in
this
way
i
might
repel
her
without
giving
offence
but
layelah
was
quite
ready
with
her
reply
if
you
love
almah
said
she
that
is
the
very
reason
why
you
should
marry
me
this
made
me
feel
more
embarrassed
than
ever
i
stammered
something
about
my
own
feelings
the
manners
and
customs
of
my
race
and
the
fear
that
i
had
of
acting
against
my
own
principles
besides
i
added
i
afraid
it
would
make
you
unhappy
oh
no
said
layelah
briskly
on
the
contrary
it
would
make
me
very
happy
indeed
i
began
to
be
more
and
more
aghast
at
this
tremendous
frankness
and
was
utterly
at
a
loss
what
to
say
my
father
continued
layelah
is
different
from
the
other
kosekin
and
so
am
i
seek
requital
for
love
and
do
not
think
it
an
evil
a
sudden
thought
now
suggested
itself
and
i
caught
at
it
as
a
last
resort
you
have
said
i
some
lover
among
the
kosekin
why
do
you
not
marry
him
layelah
smiled
i
have
no
lover
that
i
love
said
she
among
the
kosekin
my
feeble
effort
was
thus
a
miserable
failure
i
was
about
saying
something
concerning
the
kosekin
alphabet
or
something
else
of
an
equally
appropriate
nature
when
she
prevented
me
said
she
in
a
low
voice
layelah
said
i
with
my
mind
full
of
confusion
i
love
you
she
sat
looking
at
me
with
her
beautiful
face
all
aglow
her
dark
eyes
fixed
on
mine
with
an
intense
and
eager
gaze
i
looked
at
her
and
said
not
one
single
word
layelah
was
the
first
to
break
the
awkward
silence
you
love
almah
but
say
do
you
not
love
me
you
smile
at
me
you
meet
me
always
when
i
come
with
warm
greetings
and
you
seem
to
enjoy
yourself
in
my
society
say
do
you
not
love
me
this
was
a
perilous
and
a
tremendous
moment
the
fact
is
i
did
like
layelah
very
much
indeed
and
i
wanted
to
tell
her
so
but
my
ignorance
of
the
language
did
not
allow
me
to
observe
those
nice
distinctions
of
meaning
which
exist
between
the
words
like
and
love
i
knew
no
other
word
than
the
one
kosekin
word
meaning
love
and
could
not
think
of
any
meaning
like
it
was
therefore
a
very
trying
position
for
me
dear
layelah
said
i
floundering
and
stammering
in
my
confusion
i
love
you
i
but
here
i
was
interrupted
without
waiting
for
any
further
words
the
beautiful
creature
flung
her
arms
around
me
and
clung
to
me
with
a
fond
embrace
as
for
me
i
was
utterly
confounded
bewildered
and
desperate
i
thought
of
my
darling
almah
whom
alone
i
loved
it
seemed
at
that
moment
as
though
i
was
not
only
false
to
her
but
as
if
i
was
even
endangering
her
life
my
only
thought
now
was
to
clear
up
my
meaning
dear
layelah
said
i
as
i
sat
with
her
arms
around
me
and
with
my
own
around
her
slender
waist
i
do
not
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
oh
oh
my
love
never
never
did
i
know
such
bliss
as
this
here
again
i
was
overwhelmed
but
i
still
persisted
in
my
effort
dear
layelah
said
i
i
love
almah
most
dearly
and
most
tenderly
oh
why
speak
of
that
i
know
it
well
and
so
by
our
kosekin
law
you
give
her
up
among
us
lovers
never
marry
so
you
take
me
your
own
layelah
and
you
will
have
me
for
your
bride
and
my
love
for
you
is
ten
thousand
times
stronger
than
that
of
the
cold
and
melancholy
almah
she
may
marry
my
papa
this
suggestion
filled
me
with
dismay
oh
no
said
i
never
never
will
i
give
up
almah
certainly
not
said
layelah
you
do
not
give
her
up
she
gives
you
up
she
never
will
said
i
oh
yes
said
layelah
i
will
tell
her
that
you
wish
it
i
do
not
wish
it
said
i
i
love
her
and
will
never
give
her
up
it
all
the
same
said
layelah
you
can
not
marry
her
at
all
no
one
will
marry
you
you
and
almah
are
victims
and
the
state
has
given
you
the
matchless
honor
of
death
common
people
who
love
one
another
may
marry
if
they
choose
and
take
the
punishment
which
the
law
assigns
but
illustrious
victims
who
love
can
not
marry
and
so
my
you
have
only
me
i
need
not
say
that
all
this
was
excessively
embarrassing
i
was
certainly
fond
of
layelah
and
liked
her
too
much
to
hurt
her
feelings
had
i
been
one
of
the
kosekin
i
might
perhaps
have
managed
better
but
being
a
european
a
man
of
the
aryan
race
being
such
and
sitting
there
with
the
beautiful
layelah
lavishing
all
her
affections
upon
me
why
it
stands
to
reason
that
i
could
not
have
the
heart
to
wound
her
feelings
in
any
way
i
was
taken
at
an
utter
disadvantage
never
in
my
life
had
i
heard
of
women
taking
the
initiative
layelah
had
proposed
to
me
she
would
not
listen
to
refusal
and
i
had
not
the
heart
to
wound
her
i
had
made
all
the
fight
i
could
by
persisting
in
asserting
my
love
for
almah
but
all
my
assertions
were
brushed
lightly
aside
as
trivial
things
let
any
gentleman
put
himself
in
my
situation
and
ask
himself
what
he
would
do
what
would
he
do
if
such
a
thing
could
happen
to
him
at
home
but
there
such
a
thing
could
not
happen
and
so
there
is
no
use
in
supposing
an
impossible
case
at
any
rate
i
think
i
deserve
sympathy
who
could
keep
his
presence
of
mind
under
such
circumstances
with
us
a
young
lady
who
loves
one
man
can
easily
repel
another
suitor
but
here
it
was
very
different
for
how
could
i
repel
layelah
could
i
turn
upon
her
and
say
unhand
me
could
i
say
away
i
am
another
of
course
i
could
and
what
worse
if
i
had
said
such
things
layelah
would
have
smiled
me
down
into
silence
the
fact
is
it
does
do
for
women
to
take
the
initiative
it
not
fair
i
had
stood
a
good
deal
among
the
kosekin
their
love
of
darkness
their
passion
for
death
their
contempt
of
riches
their
yearning
after
unrequited
love
their
human
sacrifices
their
cannibalism
all
had
more
or
less
become
familiar
to
me
and
i
had
learned
to
acquiesce
in
silence
but
now
when
it
came
to
this
that
a
woman
should
propose
to
a
man
it
really
was
more
than
a
fellow
could
stand
i
felt
this
at
that
moment
very
forcibly
but
then
the
worst
of
it
was
that
layelah
was
so
confoundedly
pretty
and
had
such
a
nice
way
with
her
that
hang
me
if
i
knew
what
to
say
meanwhile
layelah
was
not
silent
she
had
all
her
wits
about
her
dear
papa
said
she
would
make
such
a
nice
husband
for
almah
he
is
a
widower
you
know
i
could
easily
persuade
him
to
marry
her
he
always
does
whatever
i
ask
him
to
do
but
victims
can
not
marry
you
said
no
said
layelah
sweetly
they
can
not
marry
one
another
but
almah
may
marry
dear
papa
and
then
you
and
i
can
be
married
and
it
will
be
all
very
nice
indeed
at
this
i
started
away
no
said
i
indignantly
it
wo
be
nice
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
almah
and
i
not
going
to
give
her
up
oh
but
she
gives
you
up
you
know
said
layelah
quietly
well
but
i
not
going
to
be
given
up
why
how
unreasonable
you
are
you
foolish
boy
said
layelah
in
her
most
caressing
manner
you
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
at
this
i
was
in
fresh
despair
and
then
a
new
thought
came
which
i
seized
upon
see
here
said
i
why
ca
i
marry
both
of
you
i
engaged
to
almah
and
i
love
her
better
than
all
the
world
let
me
marry
her
and
you
too
at
this
layelah
laughed
long
and
merrily
peal
after
peal
of
laughter
musical
and
most
merry
burst
from
her
it
was
contagious
i
could
not
help
joining
in
and
so
we
both
sat
laughing
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
regained
our
why
that
downright
bigamy
exclaimed
layelah
with
fresh
laughter
why
you
mad
and
so
she
went
off
again
in
fresh
peals
of
laughter
it
was
evident
that
my
proposal
was
not
at
all
shocking
but
simply
comical
ridiculous
and
inconceivable
in
its
absurdity
it
was
to
her
what
the
remark
of
some
despairing
beauty
would
be
among
us
who
when
pressed
by
two
lovers
should
express
a
confused
willingness
to
marry
both
it
was
evident
that
layelah
accepted
it
as
a
ludicrous
jest
laughter
was
all
very
well
of
course
but
i
was
serious
and
felt
that
i
ought
not
to
part
with
layelah
without
some
better
understanding
and
so
i
once
more
made
an
effort
all
this
said
i
in
a
mournful
tone
is
a
mere
mockery
what
have
i
to
say
about
love
and
marriage
if
you
loved
me
as
you
say
you
would
not
laugh
but
weep
you
forget
what
i
am
what
am
i
a
victim
and
doomed
doomed
to
a
hideous
fate
a
fate
of
horror
unutterable
you
can
not
even
begin
to
imagine
the
anguish
with
which
i
look
forward
to
that
fate
which
impends
over
me
and
almah
marriage
idle
word
what
have
i
to
do
with
marriage
what
has
almah
there
is
only
one
marriage
before
us
the
dread
marriage
with
death
why
talk
of
love
to
the
dying
the
tremendous
ordeal
the
sacrifice
is
before
us
and
after
that
there
remains
the
hideous
mista
kosek
at
this
layelah
sprang
up
with
her
whole
face
and
attitude
full
of
life
and
energy
i
know
i
know
said
she
quickly
i
have
arranged
for
all
your
life
shall
be
saved
do
you
think
that
i
have
consented
to
your
death
never
you
are
mine
i
will
save
you
i
will
show
you
what
we
can
do
you
shall
escape
can
you
really
save
me
i
cried
i
can
what
in
spite
of
the
whole
nation
layelah
laughed
scornfully
i
can
save
you
said
she
we
can
fly
there
are
other
nations
beside
ours
we
can
find
some
land
among
the
gojin
where
we
can
live
in
peace
the
gojin
are
not
like
us
but
almah
said
i
the
face
of
layelah
clouded
i
can
only
save
you
said
she
then
i
will
stay
and
die
with
almah
said
i
obstinately
what
said
layelah
do
you
not
fear
death
of
course
i
do
said
i
but
i
rather
die
than
lose
almah
but
it
impossible
to
save
both
of
you
then
leave
me
and
save
almah
said
i
what
would
you
give
up
your
life
for
almah
yes
and
a
thousand
lives
said
i
why
said
layelah
now
you
talk
just
like
the
kosekin
you
might
as
well
be
one
of
us
you
love
death
for
the
sake
of
almah
why
not
be
more
like
the
kosekin
and
seek
after
a
separation
from
almah
layelah
was
not
at
all
offended
at
my
declaration
of
love
for
almah
she
uttered
these
words
in
a
lively
tone
and
then
said
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
chapter
xxi
the
flying
monster
i
retired
to
bed
but
could
not
sleep
the
offer
of
escape
filled
me
with
excited
thoughts
these
made
sleep
impossible
and
as
i
lay
awake
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
know
what
might
be
layelah
plan
of
escape
for
i
might
then
make
use
of
it
to
save
almah
i
determined
to
find
out
all
about
it
on
the
following
jom
to
question
her
as
to
the
lands
of
the
gojin
to
learn
all
her
purpose
it
might
be
that
i
could
make
use
of
that
very
plan
to
save
almah
but
if
not
why
then
i
was
resolved
to
remain
and
meet
my
fate
with
her
if
layelah
could
be
induced
to
take
both
of
us
i
was
of
course
resolved
to
go
trusting
to
chance
as
to
the
claims
of
layelah
upon
me
and
determined
at
all
hazards
to
be
faithful
to
almah
but
if
she
should
positively
refuse
to
save
almah
then
i
thought
it
possible
that
i
might
be
able
to
find
in
layelah
plan
of
escape
something
of
which
i
might
avail
myself
i
could
not
imagine
what
it
was
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
might
be
something
quite
feasible
especially
for
a
desperate
man
the
only
thought
i
had
was
of
escape
by
means
of
some
boat
over
the
seas
in
a
boat
i
would
be
at
home
i
could
make
use
of
a
sail
so
as
to
elude
pursuit
and
could
guide
myself
by
the
stars
the
only
thing
that
i
wanted
to
know
was
the
situation
of
the
lands
of
the
gojin
on
the
following
jom
the
kohen
gadol
and
layelah
came
quite
early
and
spent
much
time
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
kohen
gadol
devoting
himself
in
an
absurd
fashion
to
almah
it
at
once
occurred
to
me
that
layelah
had
obtained
her
father
in
her
scheme
and
that
the
old
villain
actually
imagined
that
he
could
win
the
hand
of
almah
to
almah
herself
i
had
said
nothing
whatever
about
the
proposal
of
layelah
so
that
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
intentions
of
her
companion
but
it
was
excessively
annoying
to
me
to
see
such
proceedings
going
on
under
my
own
eyes
at
the
same
time
i
felt
that
it
would
be
both
unwise
and
uncivil
to
interfere
and
i
was
also
quite
sure
that
almah
affections
were
not
to
be
diverted
from
me
by
anyone
much
less
by
such
an
elderly
party
as
the
kohen
gadol
it
was
very
trying
however
and
in
spite
of
my
confidence
in
almah
my
jealousy
was
excited
and
i
began
to
think
that
the
party
of
philosophical
radicals
were
not
so
agreeable
as
the
orthodox
cannibals
whom
i
first
met
as
for
layelah
she
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
any
disturbance
in
my
mind
she
was
as
amiable
as
sprightly
as
inquisitive
and
as
affectionate
as
ever
she
even
outdid
herself
and
devoted
herself
to
me
with
an
abandon
that
was
quite
irresistible
after
almah
had
left
me
layelah
came
again
and
this
time
she
was
alone
i
have
come
said
she
to
show
you
the
way
in
which
we
can
escape
whenever
you
decide
to
do
so
it
was
the
thing
above
all
others
which
i
wished
to
know
and
therefore
i
questioned
her
eagerly
about
it
but
to
all
of
my
questions
she
only
replied
that
she
would
show
me
and
i
might
judge
for
myself
layelah
led
the
way
and
i
followed
her
we
traversed
long
galleries
and
vast
halls
all
of
which
were
quite
empty
it
was
the
and
only
those
were
visible
who
had
some
duties
which
kept
them
up
later
than
usual
faint
twinkling
lights
but
feebly
illuminated
the
general
gloom
at
length
we
came
to
an
immense
cavern
which
was
darker
than
ever
and
without
any
lamps
at
all
through
a
vast
portal
which
was
closed
with
a
barred
gateway
the
beams
of
the
brilliant
aurora
penetrated
and
disclosed
something
of
the
interior
here
layelah
stopped
and
peered
through
the
gloom
while
i
stood
waiting
by
her
side
wondering
what
means
of
escape
could
be
found
in
this
cavern
as
i
stood
i
heard
through
the
still
air
the
sound
as
of
living
things
for
a
time
i
saw
nothing
but
at
length
i
descried
a
vast
shadowy
form
moving
forward
toward
the
portal
where
the
darkness
was
less
it
was
a
form
of
portentous
size
and
fearful
shape
and
i
could
not
make
out
at
first
the
nature
of
it
it
surpassed
all
that
i
had
ever
seen
its
head
was
large
and
its
jaws
long
armed
with
rows
of
terrible
teeth
like
those
of
a
crocodile
its
body
was
of
great
size
it
walked
on
its
so
as
to
maintain
itself
in
an
upright
attitude
and
in
that
position
its
height
was
over
twelve
feet
but
the
most
amazing
thing
about
this
monster
has
yet
to
be
told
as
it
walked
its
forearms
waved
and
fluttered
and
i
saw
descending
from
them
what
seemed
like
vast
folded
leathern
wings
which
shook
and
swayed
in
the
air
at
every
step
its
pace
was
about
as
fast
as
that
of
a
man
and
it
moved
with
ease
and
lightness
it
seemed
like
some
enormous
bat
or
rather
like
a
winged
crocodile
or
yet
again
like
one
of
those
monstrous
dragons
of
which
i
had
read
but
in
whose
actual
existence
i
had
never
believed
yet
here
i
saw
one
living
and
moving
before
me
an
actual
dragon
with
the
exception
of
a
tail
for
that
appendage
which
plays
so
great
a
part
in
all
the
pictures
of
dragons
had
no
place
here
this
beast
had
but
a
short
caudal
appendage
and
all
its
terrors
lay
in
its
jaws
and
in
its
wings
for
a
moment
i
stood
almost
lifeless
with
terror
and
surprise
then
i
shrank
back
but
layelah
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
do
be
afraid
said
she
it
only
an
athaleb
but
wo
it
wo
it
bite
i
asked
with
a
shudder
oh
no
said
layelah
it
swallows
its
victuals
whole
at
this
i
shrank
away
still
farther
do
be
afraid
said
layelah
again
its
jaws
are
muzzled
and
besides
it
a
tame
athaleb
its
jaws
are
unmuzzled
only
at
but
this
one
is
very
tame
there
are
three
or
four
others
in
here
and
all
as
tame
as
i
am
they
all
know
me
come
up
nearer
do
be
afraid
these
athalebs
are
easily
tamed
how
can
such
tremendous
monsters
be
tamed
i
asked
in
an
incredulous
tone
oh
man
can
tame
anything
the
athalebs
are
very
docile
when
they
are
taken
young
they
are
very
long
lived
this
one
has
been
in
service
here
for
a
hundred
seasons
and
more
at
this
i
began
to
regain
my
confidence
and
as
layelah
moved
nearer
to
the
athaleb
i
accompanied
her
a
nearer
view
however
was
by
no
means
reassuring
the
dragon
look
of
the
athaleb
was
stronger
than
ever
for
i
could
see
that
all
its
body
was
covered
with
scales
on
its
neck
and
back
was
a
long
ridge
of
coarse
hair
and
the
sweep
of
its
vast
arms
was
enormous
it
was
with
a
quaking
heart
that
i
stood
near
but
the
coolness
of
layelah
reassured
me
for
she
went
close
up
as
a
boy
would
go
up
to
a
tame
elephant
and
she
stroked
his
enormous
back
and
the
monster
bent
down
his
terrible
head
and
seemed
pleased
this
said
layelah
is
the
way
we
have
of
escaping
this
i
exclaimed
doubtfully
yes
said
she
he
is
trained
to
the
service
we
can
mount
on
his
back
and
he
will
fly
with
us
wherever
i
choose
to
guide
him
what
i
exclaimed
as
i
shrank
back
fly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
mount
this
hideous
monster
and
trust
yourself
to
him
certainly
said
layelah
quietly
he
is
very
docile
there
is
harness
here
with
which
we
can
guide
him
should
you
like
to
see
him
harnessed
very
much
indeed
said
i
upon
this
layelah
walked
up
to
the
monster
and
stroked
his
breast
the
huge
athaleb
at
once
lay
down
upon
his
belly
then
she
brought
two
long
straps
like
reins
and
fastened
each
to
the
tip
of
a
projecting
tip
of
each
wing
then
she
fastened
a
collar
around
his
neck
to
which
there
was
attached
a
we
seat
ourselves
on
his
back
said
layelah
i
guide
with
these
reins
when
we
land
anywhere
i
fasten
him
with
the
grapple
he
looks
dull
now
but
if
i
were
to
open
the
gate
and
remove
his
muzzle
he
would
be
off
like
the
wind
but
can
he
carry
both
of
us
i
asked
easily
said
layelah
he
can
carry
three
persons
without
fatigue
could
you
mount
on
his
back
now
and
show
me
how
you
sit
layelah
readily
assented
and
mounted
with
the
greatest
ease
seating
herself
on
the
broadest
part
of
the
back
between
the
wings
here
said
she
is
room
for
you
will
you
not
come
for
an
instant
i
hesitated
but
then
the
sight
of
her
seated
there
as
coolly
as
though
she
were
on
a
chair
reassured
me
and
i
climbed
up
also
though
not
without
a
shudder
the
touch
of
the
fearful
monster
was
abhorrent
but
i
conquered
my
disgust
and
seated
myself
close
behind
layelah
here
she
sat
holding
the
reins
in
her
hands
with
the
grapple
just
in
front
of
her
and
seated
in
this
position
she
went
on
to
explain
the
whole
process
by
which
the
mighty
monster
was
guided
through
the
air
no
sooner
had
i
found
myself
actually
on
the
back
of
the
athaleb
than
all
fear
left
me
i
perceived
fully
how
completely
tame
he
was
and
how
docile
the
reins
attached
to
his
wings
could
be
pulled
with
the
greatest
ease
just
as
one
would
pull
the
of
a
boat
familiarity
breeds
contempt
and
now
since
the
first
terror
had
passed
away
i
felt
perfect
confidence
and
under
the
encouragement
of
layelah
i
had
become
like
some
rustic
in
a
menagerie
who
at
first
is
terrified
by
the
sight
of
the
elephant
but
soon
gains
courage
enough
to
mount
upon
his
back
with
my
courage
and
presence
of
mind
i
listened
most
attentively
to
all
of
layelah
explanations
and
watched
most
closely
the
construction
and
fastening
of
the
harness
for
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
that
this
athaleb
might
be
of
avail
in
another
way
that
if
i
did
not
fly
with
layelah
i
might
fly
with
almah
this
thought
was
only
of
a
vague
and
shadowy
character
a
dim
suggestion
the
carrying
out
of
which
i
scarce
dared
to
think
possible
still
it
was
in
my
mind
and
had
sufficient
power
over
me
to
make
me
very
curious
as
to
the
plans
of
layelah
i
determined
to
find
out
where
she
proposed
to
go
and
how
far
to
ask
her
about
the
dangers
of
the
way
and
the
means
of
sustenance
it
seemed
i
confess
rather
unfair
to
layelah
to
find
out
her
plans
and
use
them
for
another
purpose
but
then
that
other
purpose
was
almah
and
to
me
at
that
time
every
device
which
was
for
her
safety
seemed
fair
and
honorable
here
said
layelah
here
you
see
the
way
of
escape
the
athaleb
can
carry
us
both
far
away
to
a
land
where
you
need
never
fear
that
they
will
put
you
to
death
a
land
where
the
people
love
light
and
life
whenever
you
are
ready
to
go
tell
me
if
you
are
ready
to
go
now
say
so
and
at
once
i
will
open
the
door
and
we
shall
soon
be
far
away
she
laid
her
hand
on
mine
and
looked
at
me
earnestly
but
i
was
not
to
be
beguiled
into
any
hasty
committal
of
myself
and
so
i
turned
her
proposal
away
with
a
question
how
far
is
it
i
asked
to
that
land
it
is
too
far
for
one
flight
said
layelah
we
go
first
over
the
sea
till
we
come
to
a
great
island
which
is
called
magones
where
there
are
mountains
of
fire
there
we
must
rest
and
feed
the
athaleb
on
fish
which
are
to
be
found
on
the
shore
the
athaleb
knows
his
way
there
well
for
he
goes
there
once
every
season
for
a
certain
sacred
ceremony
he
has
done
this
for
fifty
or
sixty
seasons
and
knows
his
way
there
and
back
perfectly
well
the
difficulty
will
be
when
we
leave
magones
in
reaching
the
land
of
the
orin
the
orin
i
repeated
who
are
they
they
are
a
people
among
the
gojin
who
love
life
and
light
it
is
their
land
that
i
wish
to
reach
if
possible
where
is
it
i
asked
eagerly
i
can
not
explain
said
layelah
i
can
only
trust
to
my
own
skill
and
hope
to
find
the
place
we
may
have
to
pass
over
different
lands
of
the
gojin
and
if
so
we
may
be
in
danger
what
is
the
reason
why
the
athaleb
goes
to
magones
every
season
i
asked
to
take
there
the
chief
pauper
of
the
season
who
has
won
the
prize
of
death
by
starvation
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
honors
among
the
kosekin
is
magones
barren
it
is
an
island
of
fire
without
anything
on
it
but
craggy
mountains
and
wild
rocks
and
flowing
rivers
of
fire
it
stands
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
how
can
we
get
away
from
here
i
asked
after
some
silence
from
here
why
i
open
the
gates
and
the
athaleb
flies
away
that
is
all
but
shall
we
not
be
prevented
oh
no
no
one
here
ever
prevents
anyone
from
doing
anything
everyone
is
eager
to
help
his
neighbor
but
if
they
saw
me
deliberately
mounting
the
athaleb
and
preparing
for
flight
would
they
not
stop
me
no
i
was
amazed
at
this
but
said
i
am
i
not
a
victim
preserved
for
the
great
sacrifice
you
are
but
you
are
free
to
go
where
you
like
and
do
what
you
like
your
character
of
victim
makes
you
most
distinguished
it
is
the
highest
honor
and
dignity
all
believe
that
you
rejoice
in
your
high
dignity
and
no
one
dreams
that
you
are
anxious
to
escape
but
if
i
did
escape
would
they
not
pursue
me
certainly
not
what
would
they
do
for
a
victim
they
would
wonder
at
your
unaccountable
flight
and
then
choose
some
distinguished
pauper
but
if
i
were
to
stay
here
would
they
not
save
me
from
death
at
my
entreaty
oh
certainly
not
they
would
never
understand
such
an
entreaty
that
a
question
of
death
the
supreme
blessing
no
one
is
capable
of
such
a
base
act
as
saving
his
from
death
all
are
eager
to
help
each
other
to
such
a
fate
but
if
i
were
to
fly
they
would
not
prevent
me
and
they
would
not
pursue
me
oh
no
are
there
any
in
the
land
who
are
exempt
from
the
sacrifice
oh
yes
the
athons
meleks
and
kohens
these
are
not
worthy
of
the
honor
the
artisans
and
tradesmen
are
sometimes
permitted
to
attain
to
this
honor
the
laborers
in
greater
numbers
but
it
is
the
paupers
who
are
chiefly
favored
and
this
is
a
matter
of
complaint
among
the
rich
and
powerful
that
they
can
not
be
sacrificed
well
why
could
i
be
made
an
athon
or
a
kohen
and
be
exempted
in
that
way
oh
that
would
be
too
great
a
dishonor
it
would
be
impossible
on
the
contrary
the
whole
people
are
anxious
to
honor
you
to
the
very
uttermost
and
to
bestow
upon
you
the
greatest
privileges
and
blessings
which
can
possibly
be
given
oh
no
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
allow
you
to
become
an
athon
or
a
kohen
as
for
me
i
am
malca
and
therefore
the
lowest
in
the
land
pitied
and
commiserated
by
the
haughty
pauper
class
who
shake
their
heads
at
the
thought
of
one
like
me
all
the
people
shower
upon
me
incessantly
new
gifts
and
new
offices
if
my
present
love
of
light
and
life
were
generally
known
they
would
punish
me
by
giving
me
new
contributions
of
wealth
and
new
offices
and
powers
which
i
do
not
want
but
you
love
riches
do
you
not
and
you
must
want
them
still
no
said
layelah
i
do
not
want
them
now
why
what
do
you
want
i
asked
you
said
she
with
a
sweet
smile
i
said
nothing
but
tried
desperately
to
think
of
something
that
might
divert
the
conversation
layelah
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
on
in
a
musing
tone
as
i
was
saying
i
love
you
and
i
hate
almah
because
you
love
her
i
think
almah
is
the
only
human
being
in
all
the
world
that
i
ever
really
hated
and
yet
though
i
hate
her
still
strange
to
say
i
feel
as
though
i
should
like
to
give
her
the
immense
blessing
of
death
and
that
is
a
very
strange
feeling
indeed
for
one
of
the
kosekin
do
you
understand
what
such
can
possibly
be
i
did
not
answer
but
turned
away
the
conversation
by
a
violent
effort
are
there
any
other
athalebs
here
oh
yes
how
many
four
are
they
all
as
tame
as
this
oh
yes
all
quite
as
tame
there
is
no
difference
whatever
upon
this
i
left
the
back
of
the
athaleb
and
layelah
also
descended
after
which
she
proceeded
to
show
me
the
other
monsters
at
length
she
unharnessed
the
athaleb
and
we
left
the
cavern
chapter
xxii
escape
on
the
following
jom
i
told
everything
to
almah
i
told
her
that
layelah
was
urging
me
to
fly
with
her
and
that
i
had
found
out
all
about
her
plans
i
described
the
athalebs
informed
her
about
the
direction
which
we
were
to
take
the
island
of
fire
and
the
country
of
the
orin
at
this
intelligence
almah
was
filled
with
delight
and
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
come
to
the
amir
there
were
smiles
of
joy
upon
her
face
she
needed
no
persuasion
she
was
ready
to
set
forth
whenever
it
was
fitting
and
to
risk
everything
upon
this
enterprise
she
felt
as
i
did
and
thought
that
the
wildest
attempt
was
better
than
this
dull
inaction
death
was
before
us
here
and
every
jom
as
it
passed
only
brought
it
nearer
true
we
were
treated
with
the
utmost
kindness
we
lived
in
royal
splendor
we
had
enormous
retinues
but
all
this
was
a
miserable
mockery
since
it
all
served
as
the
prelude
to
our
inevitable
doom
for
that
doom
it
was
hard
indeed
to
wait
anything
was
better
far
better
would
it
be
to
risk
all
the
dangers
of
this
unusual
and
amazing
flight
to
brave
the
terrors
of
that
drear
isle
of
fire
magones
better
to
perish
there
of
starvation
or
to
be
killed
by
the
hands
of
hostile
gojin
than
to
wait
here
and
be
destroyed
at
last
by
the
sacrificial
knife
of
these
smiling
generous
fiends
to
be
killed
ay
and
afterward
borne
to
the
tremendous
mista
kosek
there
was
a
difficulty
with
layelah
that
had
to
be
guarded
against
in
the
first
place
that
she
might
not
suspect
and
again
that
we
might
choose
our
time
of
escape
when
she
would
not
be
at
all
likely
to
find
us
out
we
resolved
to
make
our
attempt
without
any
further
delay
layelah
was
with
us
for
the
greater
part
of
that
jom
and
the
kohen
gadol
also
gave
us
much
of
his
company
layelah
did
not
seem
to
have
any
suspicions
whatever
of
my
secret
purpose
for
she
was
as
bright
as
amiable
and
as
devoted
to
me
as
ever
while
the
kohen
gadol
sought
as
before
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
almah
i
did
not
think
fit
to
tell
her
about
layelah
proposal
and
therefore
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
secret
plans
of
the
kohen
gadol
evidently
attributing
his
attention
to
the
unfailing
amiability
of
the
kosekin
layelah
came
again
after
almah
had
retired
and
spent
the
time
in
trying
to
persuade
me
to
fly
with
her
the
beautiful
girl
was
certainly
never
more
engaging
nor
was
she
ever
more
tender
had
it
not
been
for
almah
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
resist
such
sweet
persuasions
but
as
it
was
i
did
resist
layelah
however
was
not
at
all
discouraged
nor
did
she
lose
any
of
her
amiability
but
when
she
took
leave
it
was
with
a
smile
and
sweet
words
of
forgiveness
on
her
lips
for
what
she
called
my
cruelty
after
she
left
i
remained
for
a
time
with
a
painful
sense
of
helplessness
the
fact
is
my
european
training
did
not
fit
me
for
encountering
such
a
state
of
things
as
existed
among
the
kosekin
it
very
easy
to
be
faithful
to
one
own
in
england
when
other
fair
ladies
hold
aloof
and
wait
to
be
sought
but
here
among
the
kosekin
women
have
as
much
liberty
in
making
love
as
men
and
there
is
no
law
or
custom
about
it
if
a
woman
chooses
she
can
pay
the
most
desperate
attentions
and
play
the
part
of
a
distracted
lover
to
her
heart
content
in
most
cases
the
women
actually
take
the
initiative
as
they
are
more
impressible
and
impulsive
than
men
and
so
it
was
that
layelah
made
me
the
object
of
her
persistent
assault
acting
all
the
time
too
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
country
and
thus
having
no
thought
whatever
of
indelicacy
since
according
to
the
kosekin
she
was
acting
simply
in
accordance
with
the
rights
of
every
woman
now
where
a
woman
is
urged
by
one
ardent
lover
to
dismiss
her
other
lover
she
may
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
play
her
part
satisfactorily
but
in
my
case
i
did
not
play
my
part
satisfactorily
at
all
the
ordeal
was
too
hard
and
i
was
utterly
unable
to
show
to
layelah
that
firmness
and
decision
of
character
which
the
occasion
demanded
yet
after
all
the
ordeal
at
last
ended
layelah
left
as
i
have
said
with
sweet
words
of
forgiveness
on
her
lips
and
i
after
a
time
succeeded
in
regaining
my
presence
of
mind
almah
was
waiting
and
she
soon
joined
me
we
gathered
a
few
articles
for
the
journey
the
chief
of
which
were
my
rifle
and
pistol
which
i
had
not
used
here
and
then
we
set
forth
leaving
our
apartments
we
traversed
the
long
passages
and
at
length
came
to
the
cavern
of
the
athalebs
we
met
several
people
on
the
way
who
looked
at
us
with
smiles
but
made
no
other
sign
it
was
evident
that
they
had
no
commission
to
watch
us
and
that
thus
far
layelah
information
was
correct
upon
entering
the
cavern
of
the
athalebs
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
helplessness
for
i
had
no
confidence
whatever
in
my
own
powers
of
managing
these
awful
monsters
nor
did
i
feel
sure
that
i
could
harness
them
but
the
emergency
was
a
pressing
one
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
seen
where
layelah
had
left
the
harness
and
now
my
chief
desire
was
to
secure
one
of
the
athalebs
the
faint
light
served
to
disclose
nothing
but
gloom
and
i
waited
for
a
while
hoping
that
one
of
them
would
come
forward
as
before
but
waiting
did
no
good
for
no
movement
was
made
and
i
had
to
try
what
i
could
do
myself
to
rouse
them
so
i
walked
farther
in
toward
the
back
part
of
the
cavern
peering
through
the
gloom
while
almah
remained
near
the
entrance
as
i
advanced
i
heard
a
slight
noise
as
of
someone
moving
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
athalebs
and
walked
on
farther
peering
through
the
gloom
when
suddenly
i
came
full
upon
a
man
who
was
busy
at
some
work
which
i
could
not
make
out
for
a
moment
i
stood
in
amazement
and
despair
for
it
seemed
as
though
all
was
lost
and
as
if
this
man
would
at
once
divine
my
intent
while
i
stood
thus
he
turned
and
gave
me
a
very
courteous
greeting
after
which
in
the
usual
manner
of
the
kosekin
he
asked
me
with
much
amiability
what
he
could
do
for
me
i
muttered
something
about
seeing
the
athalebs
upon
which
he
informed
me
that
he
would
show
them
to
me
with
pleasure
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
recently
been
raised
from
the
low
position
of
athon
to
that
of
feeder
of
the
athalebs
a
post
involving
duties
like
those
of
ostlers
or
grooms
among
us
but
which
here
indicated
high
rank
and
honor
he
was
proud
of
his
title
of
epet
which
means
servant
and
more
than
usually
obliging
i
at
once
took
advantage
of
his
complaisance
and
requested
him
to
show
me
the
athalebs
upon
this
he
led
the
way
farther
on
where
i
could
see
through
the
gloom
the
shadowy
outlines
of
four
monsters
all
of
which
were
resting
in
an
upright
posture
against
the
wall
with
their
claws
fixed
on
a
shelf
of
rock
they
looked
more
than
ever
like
dragons
or
rather
like
enormous
bats
for
their
wings
were
disclosed
hanging
in
loose
leathern
folds
can
they
be
roused
i
asked
and
made
to
move
oh
yes
said
the
epet
and
without
waiting
for
any
further
request
he
proceeded
to
pull
at
the
loose
wing
of
the
nearest
one
the
monster
drew
himself
together
gave
a
flutter
with
his
wings
and
then
moved
back
from
the
wall
make
him
walk
said
i
eagerly
the
epet
at
this
pulled
upon
his
wing
once
more
and
the
athaleb
moved
forward
bring
him
to
the
portal
so
that
i
may
see
him
said
i
the
epet
still
holding
the
athaleb
wing
pulled
at
him
and
thus
guided
him
toward
the
portal
i
was
amazed
at
the
docility
of
this
terrific
monster
yet
after
all
i
thought
that
it
was
no
more
astonishing
than
the
docility
of
the
elephant
which
in
like
manner
allows
itself
to
be
guided
by
the
slightest
pressure
a
child
may
lead
a
vast
elephant
with
ease
and
here
with
equal
ease
the
epet
led
the
athaleb
he
led
him
up
near
to
the
portal
where
the
aurora
light
beamed
through
far
brighter
than
the
brightest
moon
and
disclosed
all
the
vast
proportions
of
the
monster
i
stood
and
looked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
and
now
layelah
words
occurred
to
me
as
to
the
perfect
willingness
of
the
kosekin
to
do
anything
which
one
might
wish
she
had
insisted
on
it
that
they
would
not
prevent
our
flight
and
had
given
me
to
understand
that
they
would
even
assist
me
if
i
should
ask
them
this
is
what
now
occurred
to
me
and
i
determined
to
make
a
trial
so
i
said
i
should
like
to
fly
in
the
air
on
the
athaleb
will
you
harness
him
i
confess
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
i
said
this
but
the
feeling
was
soon
dissipated
the
epet
heard
my
words
with
perfect
coolness
as
though
they
conveyed
the
most
natural
request
in
the
world
and
then
proceeded
to
obey
me
just
as
at
home
a
servant
might
hear
and
obey
his
master
who
might
say
i
should
like
to
take
a
ride
will
you
harness
the
bay
mare
so
the
epet
proceeded
to
harness
the
athaleb
and
i
watched
him
in
silence
but
it
was
the
silence
of
deep
suspense
and
my
heart
throbbed
painfully
there
was
yet
much
to
be
risked
the
gates
had
to
be
opened
others
might
interfere
layelah
might
come
all
these
thoughts
occurred
to
me
as
i
watched
the
epet
and
though
the
labor
of
harnessing
the
athaleb
was
simple
and
soon
performed
still
the
time
seemed
long
so
the
collar
was
secured
around
the
neck
of
the
athaleb
with
the
grapple
attached
and
the
lines
were
fastened
to
the
wings
and
then
almah
and
i
mounted
the
epet
now
stood
waiting
for
further
orders
open
the
gates
said
i
the
epet
did
so
almah
was
seated
on
the
back
of
the
athaleb
before
me
holding
on
to
the
coarse
mane
i
just
behind
held
the
reins
in
my
hand
the
gates
were
opened
wide
a
few
people
outside
roused
by
the
noise
of
the
opening
gates
stood
and
looked
on
they
had
evidently
no
other
feeling
but
curiosity
all
was
now
ready
and
the
way
was
open
but
there
was
an
unexpected
difficulty
the
athaleb
would
not
start
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
make
him
i
had
once
more
to
apply
for
help
to
the
epet
how
am
i
to
make
him
start
i
asked
pull
at
the
collar
to
make
him
start
and
pull
at
both
reins
to
make
him
stop
said
the
epet
upon
this
i
pulled
at
the
collar
the
athaleb
obeyed
at
once
he
rose
almost
erect
and
moved
out
through
the
gate
it
was
difficult
to
hold
on
but
we
did
so
on
reaching
the
terrace
outside
the
athaleb
expanded
his
vast
wings
which
spread
out
over
a
space
of
full
fifty
feet
and
then
with
vigorous
motions
raised
himself
in
the
air
it
was
a
moment
full
of
terror
to
both
of
us
the
strange
sensation
of
rising
in
the
air
the
quivering
muscles
of
the
athaleb
at
the
working
of
the
enormous
pinions
the
tremendous
display
of
strength
all
combined
to
overwhelm
me
with
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
with
one
hand
i
clung
to
the
stiff
mane
of
the
monster
with
the
other
i
held
almah
who
was
also
grasping
the
athaleb
hair
and
thus
for
some
time
all
thought
was
taken
up
in
the
one
purpose
of
holding
on
but
at
length
the
athaleb
lay
in
the
air
in
a
perfectly
horizontal
position
the
beat
of
the
wings
grew
more
slow
and
even
the
muscular
exertion
more
steady
and
sustained
we
both
began
to
regain
some
degree
of
confidence
and
at
length
i
raised
myself
up
and
looked
around
it
did
not
seem
long
since
we
had
left
but
already
the
city
was
far
behind
rising
with
its
long
crescent
terraces
sparkling
and
twinkling
with
innumerable
lights
we
had
passed
beyond
the
bay
the
harbor
was
behind
us
the
open
sea
before
us
the
deep
water
beneath
the
athaleb
flew
low
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
above
the
water
and
maintained
that
distance
all
the
time
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
he
might
drop
into
the
water
at
any
time
but
this
was
only
fancy
for
he
was
perfect
master
of
all
his
movement
and
his
flight
was
swift
and
well
sustained
overhead
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
aurora
beams
which
spread
everywhere
flashing
out
from
the
zenith
and
illuminating
the
earth
with
a
glow
brighter
than
that
of
the
brightest
moon
beneath
the
dark
waters
of
the
sea
extended
with
the
waves
breaking
into
foam
and
traversed
by
galleys
by
and
by
the
navies
of
the
kosekin
far
away
the
surface
of
the
sea
spread
with
that
marvellous
appearance
of
an
endless
ascent
as
though
for
a
thousand
miles
rising
thus
until
it
terminated
up
the
sky
and
so
it
rose
up
on
every
side
so
that
i
seemed
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
a
world
an
immense
and
immeasurable
hollow
a
world
unparalleled
and
unintelligible
far
away
at
almost
infinite
distances
arose
the
long
lines
of
mountains
which
crowned
with
ice
gleamed
in
the
aurora
light
and
seemed
like
a
barrier
that
made
forever
impossible
all
ingress
and
egress
on
and
on
we
sped
at
length
we
grew
perfectly
accustomed
to
the
situation
the
motion
was
so
easy
and
our
seats
were
so
secure
there
were
no
obstacles
in
our
way
no
roughness
along
our
path
for
that
pathway
was
the
smooth
air
and
in
such
a
path
there
could
be
no
interruption
no
jerk
or
jar
after
the
first
terror
had
passed
there
remained
no
longer
any
necessity
for
holding
on
we
could
sit
and
look
around
with
perfect
freedom
and
at
length
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
almah
stood
beside
me
and
thus
we
stood
for
a
long
time
with
all
our
souls
kindled
into
glowing
enthusiasm
by
the
excitement
of
that
adventurous
flight
and
the
splendors
of
that
unequalled
scene
at
length
the
aurora
light
grew
dim
then
came
forth
the
stars
glowing
and
burning
in
the
black
sky
beneath
there
was
nothing
visible
but
the
darkness
of
the
water
spotted
with
phosphorescent
points
while
all
around
a
wall
of
gloom
arose
which
shut
out
from
view
the
distant
shores
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
a
noise
like
the
beat
of
vast
wings
and
these
wings
were
not
those
of
our
athaleb
at
first
i
thought
it
was
the
fluttering
of
a
sail
but
it
was
too
regular
and
too
long
continued
for
that
at
length
i
saw
through
the
gloom
a
vast
shadowy
form
in
the
air
behind
us
and
at
once
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
it
was
another
monster
flying
in
pursuit
were
we
pursued
were
there
men
on
his
back
should
i
resist
i
held
my
rifle
poised
and
was
resolved
to
resist
at
all
hazards
almah
saw
it
all
and
said
nothing
she
perceived
the
danger
and
in
her
eyes
i
saw
that
she
like
me
would
prefer
death
to
surrender
the
monster
came
nearer
and
nearer
until
at
last
i
could
see
that
he
was
alone
and
that
none
were
on
his
back
but
now
another
fear
arose
he
might
attack
our
athaleb
and
in
that
way
endanger
us
he
must
be
prevented
from
coming
nearer
yet
to
fire
the
rifle
was
a
serious
matter
i
had
once
before
i
learned
the
danger
of
firing
under
such
circumstances
when
my
opmahera
had
fled
in
terror
at
the
report
and
did
not
wish
to
experience
the
danger
which
might
arise
from
a
athaleb
and
so
as
i
stood
there
i
waved
my
arms
and
gesticulated
violently
the
pursuing
athaleb
seemed
frightened
at
such
an
unusual
occurrence
for
he
veered
off
and
soon
was
lost
in
the
darkness
chapter
xxiii
the
island
of
fire
at
last
there
appeared
before
us
what
seemed
like
a
long
line
of
fires
and
as
we
looked
we
could
see
bursts
of
flame
at
fitful
intervals
which
shone
out
for
a
few
moments
and
then
died
away
upon
this
now
our
whole
attention
was
fixed
for
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
approaching
our
destination
and
that
this
place
was
the
island
of
fire
a
name
which
from
present
appearances
was
fully
justified
as
we
went
on
and
drew
steadily
nearer
the
mass
of
glowing
fire
grew
larger
and
brighter
and
what
at
first
had
seemed
a
line
was
broken
up
into
different
parts
one
of
which
far
surpassed
the
others
this
was
higher
in
the
air
and
its
shape
was
that
of
a
long
thin
sloping
line
with
a
burning
glowing
globule
at
each
end
it
seemed
like
lava
running
down
from
the
crater
of
a
volcano
and
this
appearance
was
made
certainty
on
a
nearer
approach
for
we
saw
at
the
upper
point
which
seemed
the
crater
an
outburst
of
flame
followed
by
a
new
flow
of
the
fiery
stream
in
other
places
there
were
similar
fires
but
they
were
less
bright
either
because
they
were
smaller
or
more
remote
at
length
we
heard
beneath
us
the
roar
of
breakers
and
saw
long
white
lines
of
surf
beating
upon
the
shore
our
athaleb
now
descended
and
alighted
we
clambered
to
the
ground
and
i
taking
the
grapple
fixed
it
securely
between
two
sharp
rocks
we
were
at
last
on
magones
the
island
of
fire
the
brightness
of
the
aurora
light
had
left
us
but
it
needed
not
this
to
show
us
the
dismal
nature
of
the
land
to
which
we
had
come
it
was
a
land
of
horror
where
there
was
nothing
but
the
abomination
of
desolation
a
land
overstrewn
with
blasted
fragments
of
fractured
intermixed
with
sand
from
which
there
arose
black
precipices
and
giant
mountains
that
poured
forth
rivers
of
fire
and
showers
of
ashes
and
sheets
of
flame
a
tremendous
peak
arose
before
us
with
a
crest
of
fire
and
sides
streaked
with
red
torrents
of
molten
lava
between
us
and
it
there
spread
away
a
vast
expanse
of
impassable
rocks
a
scene
of
ruin
and
savage
wildness
which
can
not
be
described
and
all
around
was
the
same
drear
and
appalling
prospect
here
in
the
the
season
of
darkness
and
of
awful
gloom
we
stood
in
this
land
of
woe
and
not
one
single
sign
appeared
of
life
save
the
life
that
we
had
brought
with
us
as
for
food
it
was
vain
to
think
of
it
to
search
after
it
would
be
useless
it
seemed
indeed
impossible
to
move
from
the
spot
where
we
were
every
moment
presented
some
new
discovery
which
added
to
the
horror
of
magones
but
almah
was
weary
for
our
flight
had
been
long
and
she
wished
to
rest
so
i
found
a
place
for
her
where
there
was
some
sand
between
two
rocks
and
here
she
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
i
sat
at
a
little
distance
off
on
a
shelf
of
the
rock
with
my
back
against
it
and
here
after
a
little
time
i
also
went
to
sleep
at
length
we
awoke
but
what
a
waking
there
was
no
morning
dawn
no
blessed
returning
light
to
greet
our
eyes
we
opened
our
eyes
to
the
same
scenes
upon
which
we
had
closed
them
and
the
darkness
was
still
deep
and
dense
around
us
over
us
both
there
was
a
sense
of
utter
depression
and
i
was
so
deeply
plunged
into
it
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
rouse
myself
even
for
the
sake
of
saying
words
of
cheer
to
almah
i
had
brought
a
few
fragments
of
food
and
upon
these
we
made
our
breakfast
but
there
was
the
athaleb
to
feed
and
for
him
i
found
nothing
nor
could
i
think
of
anything
unless
he
could
feed
upon
rocks
and
sand
yet
food
for
him
was
a
matter
of
the
highest
consequence
for
he
was
all
our
support
and
stay
and
hope
and
if
the
monster
were
deprived
of
food
he
might
turn
upon
us
and
satisfy
upon
us
his
ravenous
appetite
these
thoughts
were
painful
indeed
and
added
to
my
despondency
suddenly
i
heard
the
sound
of
running
water
i
started
away
toward
the
place
from
which
the
sound
came
and
found
only
a
little
distance
off
a
small
brook
trickling
along
on
its
way
to
the
shore
i
called
almah
and
we
both
drank
and
were
refreshed
this
showed
an
easy
way
to
get
to
the
shore
and
i
determined
to
go
there
to
see
if
there
were
any
fish
to
be
found
might
be
there
or
the
carcasses
of
dead
fish
thrown
up
by
the
sea
upon
which
the
athaleb
might
feed
i
left
my
pistol
with
almah
telling
her
to
fire
it
if
she
heard
me
fire
for
i
was
afraid
of
losing
my
way
and
therefore
took
this
precaution
i
left
it
lying
on
the
rock
and
directed
her
to
point
it
in
the
air
and
pull
the
trigger
it
was
necessary
to
take
these
precautions
as
of
course
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
its
nature
after
this
i
left
her
and
tried
to
follow
the
torrent
this
however
i
soon
found
to
be
impossible
for
the
brook
on
reaching
a
huge
rock
plunged
underneath
it
and
became
lost
to
view
i
then
went
toward
the
shore
as
well
as
i
could
now
climbing
over
sharp
rocks
now
going
round
them
until
at
length
after
immense
labor
i
succeeded
in
reaching
the
water
here
the
scene
was
almost
as
wild
as
the
one
i
had
left
there
was
no
beach
whatever
nothing
but
a
vast
extent
of
wild
fragments
of
fractured
which
were
evidently
the
result
of
some
comparatively
recent
convulsion
of
nature
for
their
edges
were
still
sharp
and
the
water
had
not
worn
even
those
which
were
within
its
grasp
to
anything
like
roundness
or
to
anything
else
than
the
jagged
and
shattered
outlines
which
had
originally
belonged
to
them
all
the
shore
thus
consisted
of
vast
rocky
blocks
over
which
the
sea
beat
in
foam
eager
to
find
something
i
toiled
along
this
rocky
shore
for
a
long
distance
but
without
seeing
any
change
i
was
unwilling
to
go
back
baffled
yet
i
was
at
length
compelled
to
do
so
but
the
necessity
of
feeding
the
athaleb
was
pressing
and
i
saw
that
our
only
course
now
would
be
to
mount
him
again
leave
this
place
and
seek
some
other
but
where
could
we
go
that
i
could
not
imagine
and
could
only
conclude
to
trust
altogether
to
the
instinct
of
the
athaleb
which
might
guide
him
to
places
where
he
might
obtain
food
such
a
course
would
involve
great
risk
for
we
might
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
vast
flocks
of
these
monsters
yet
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
now
retraced
my
steps
and
went
for
a
long
time
near
the
sea
at
length
i
found
a
place
where
the
walking
was
somewhat
easier
and
went
in
this
way
up
into
the
island
and
away
from
the
sea
it
seemed
to
lead
in
the
direction
where
i
wished
to
go
at
length
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
walked
far
enough
yet
i
could
see
no
signs
of
almah
i
shouted
but
there
was
no
answer
i
shouted
again
and
again
but
with
the
like
result
then
i
fired
my
rifle
and
listened
in
response
there
came
the
report
of
the
pistol
far
away
behind
me
it
was
evident
that
in
coming
back
along
the
shore
i
had
passed
by
the
place
where
almah
was
there
was
nothing
now
left
but
to
retrace
my
steps
and
this
i
accordingly
did
i
went
back
to
the
shore
and
returned
on
my
steps
shouting
all
the
time
until
at
length
i
was
rejoiced
to
hear
the
answering
shout
of
almah
after
this
it
was
easy
to
reach
her
we
now
took
up
the
grapple
and
once
more
mounted
the
athaleb
eager
to
be
off
raised
himself
quickly
in
the
air
and
soon
our
late
was
far
behind
his
flight
was
now
different
from
what
it
was
before
then
he
stood
off
in
one
straight
line
for
a
certain
fixed
destination
as
though
under
some
guidance
for
though
i
did
not
direct
him
still
his
long
training
had
taught
him
to
fly
to
magones
but
now
training
and
guidance
were
both
wanting
and
the
athaleb
was
left
to
the
impulse
of
his
hunger
and
the
guidance
of
his
instinct
so
he
flew
no
longer
in
one
undeviating
straight
line
but
rose
high
and
bent
his
head
down
low
and
flew
and
soared
in
vast
circles
even
as
i
have
seen
a
vulture
or
a
condor
sweep
about
while
searching
for
food
all
the
while
we
were
drawing
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
spot
which
we
had
left
we
passed
the
lofty
volcano
we
saw
more
plainly
the
rivers
of
molten
lava
we
passed
vast
cliffs
and
bleak
mountains
all
of
which
were
more
terrific
than
all
that
we
had
left
behind
now
the
darkness
lessened
for
the
aurora
was
brightening
in
the
sky
and
gathering
up
swiftly
and
gloriously
all
its
innumerable
beams
and
flashing
forth
its
lustrous
glow
upon
the
world
to
us
this
was
equal
to
the
return
of
day
it
was
like
a
blessed
dawn
light
had
come
and
we
rejoiced
and
were
exceeding
glad
now
we
saw
before
us
far
beyond
the
black
precipices
a
broad
bay
with
sloping
shores
and
a
wide
beach
which
seemed
like
a
beach
of
sand
the
surf
broke
here
but
beyond
the
surf
was
the
gentle
sandy
declivity
and
beyond
this
there
appeared
the
shores
still
rocky
and
barren
and
desolate
but
far
preferable
to
what
we
had
left
behind
far
away
in
the
interior
arose
lofty
mountains
and
volcanoes
while
behind
us
flamed
the
burning
peak
which
we
had
passed
here
the
athaleb
wheeled
in
long
circuitous
flights
which
grew
lower
and
lower
until
at
length
he
descended
upon
the
sandy
beach
where
i
saw
a
vast
lying
dead
it
had
evidently
been
thrown
up
here
by
the
sea
it
was
like
one
of
those
monsters
which
i
had
seen
from
the
galley
of
the
kohen
at
the
time
of
the
sacred
hunt
by
this
the
athaleb
descended
and
at
once
began
to
devour
it
tearing
out
vast
masses
of
flesh
and
exhibiting
such
voracity
and
strength
of
jaw
that
i
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
upon
the
sight
i
fastened
the
grapple
securely
to
the
head
of
the
dead
monster
and
leaving
the
athaleb
to
feed
upon
it
almah
and
i
went
up
the
beach
on
our
way
we
found
rocks
covered
with
and
here
we
sought
after
our
search
was
at
length
rewarded
for
suddenly
i
stumbled
upon
a
place
where
i
found
some
lobsters
i
grasped
two
of
these
but
the
others
escaped
here
at
last
i
had
found
signs
of
life
but
they
were
of
the
sea
rather
than
of
the
shore
delighted
with
my
prey
i
hastened
to
almah
to
show
them
to
her
she
recognized
them
at
once
and
i
saw
that
they
were
familiar
to
her
i
then
spoke
of
eating
them
but
at
this
proposal
she
recoiled
in
horror
she
could
not
give
any
reason
for
her
repugnance
but
merely
said
that
among
her
people
they
were
regarded
as
something
equivalent
to
vermin
and
i
found
that
she
would
no
more
think
of
eating
one
than
i
would
think
of
eating
a
rat
upon
this
i
had
to
throw
them
away
and
we
once
more
resumed
our
search
at
last
we
came
to
a
place
where
numbers
of
dead
fish
lay
on
the
sand
nearer
the
water
they
were
more
fresh
and
not
at
all
objectionable
i
picked
up
a
few
which
looked
like
our
common
smelt
and
found
that
almah
had
no
objection
to
these
but
now
the
question
arose
how
to
cook
them
neither
of
us
could
eat
them
raw
a
fire
was
necessary
yet
a
fire
was
impossible
for
on
the
whole
island
there
was
probably
not
one
single
combustible
thing
our
discovery
therefore
seemed
to
have
done
us
but
little
good
and
we
seemed
destined
to
starvation
when
fortunately
a
happy
thought
suggested
itself
in
walking
along
i
saw
far
away
the
glow
of
some
lava
which
had
flowed
to
the
shore
at
the
end
of
the
sandy
beach
and
was
probably
cooling
down
at
the
edge
here
then
was
a
natural
fire
which
might
serve
us
better
than
any
contrivance
of
our
own
and
toward
this
we
at
once
proceeded
it
was
about
two
miles
away
but
the
beach
was
smooth
and
we
reached
the
place
without
any
difficulty
here
we
found
the
edge
of
that
lava
flood
which
seemed
eternally
descending
from
the
crater
beyond
the
edge
which
was
nearest
the
water
was
black
and
the
liquid
fire
as
it
rolled
down
curled
over
this
in
a
fantastic
shape
cooling
and
hardening
into
the
form
which
it
thus
assumed
here
after
some
search
i
found
a
crevice
where
i
could
approach
the
fire
and
i
laid
the
fish
upon
a
crimson
rock
which
was
cooling
and
hardening
into
the
shape
of
a
vast
ledge
of
lava
in
this
way
by
the
aid
of
nature
the
fish
were
broiled
and
we
made
our
repast
there
was
nothing
here
to
invite
a
longer
stay
and
we
soon
returned
to
the
athaleb
we
found
the
monster
gorged
with
food
asleep
resting
upon
his
hind
legs
with
his
breast
supported
against
the
vast
carcass
almah
called
it
a
jantannin
it
was
about
sixty
feet
in
length
and
twenty
in
thickness
with
a
vast
horny
head
ponderous
jaws
and
back
covered
with
scales
its
eyes
were
of
prodigious
size
and
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
crocodile
with
the
vast
size
of
a
whale
it
was
unlike
a
crocodile
however
for
it
had
fins
rather
than
paws
and
must
have
been
as
clumsy
on
the
land
as
a
seal
or
a
walrus
it
lay
on
its
side
and
the
athaleb
had
fed
itself
from
the
uncovered
flesh
of
its
belly
there
was
nothing
here
to
induce
us
to
stay
and
so
we
wandered
along
the
beach
in
the
other
direction
on
our
right
was
the
bay
on
our
left
the
rocky
shore
which
beginning
at
the
beach
ran
back
into
the
country
a
waste
of
impassable
rocks
where
not
a
tree
or
plant
or
blade
of
grass
relieved
the
appalling
desolation
once
or
twice
we
made
an
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
country
where
openings
appeared
these
openings
seemed
like
the
beds
of
torrents
we
were
able
to
walk
but
a
few
paces
for
invariably
we
would
come
to
some
immense
blocks
of
rock
which
barred
all
farther
progress
in
this
way
we
explored
the
beach
for
miles
until
it
terminated
in
a
savage
promontory
that
rose
abruptly
from
the
sea
against
which
the
huge
billows
broke
in
thunder
then
we
retraced
our
steps
and
again
reached
the
spot
where
the
athaleb
was
asleep
by
the
jantannin
almah
was
now
too
weary
to
walk
any
farther
nor
was
it
desirable
to
do
so
for
indeed
we
had
traversed
all
that
could
be
visited
on
one
side
of
the
beach
was
the
sea
on
the
other
the
impassable
rocks
at
one
end
the
promontory
at
the
other
the
lava
fires
there
was
nothing
more
for
us
to
do
but
to
wait
here
until
the
athaleb
should
awake
and
then
our
actions
would
depend
upon
what
we
might
now
decide
this
was
the
question
that
was
now
before
us
and
this
we
began
to
consider
we
both
felt
the
most
unspeakable
aversion
for
the
island
and
to
remain
here
any
longer
was
impossible
we
would
once
more
have
to
mount
the
athaleb
and
proceed
to
some
other
shore
but
where
ah
there
was
the
question
not
on
the
island
for
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
in
all
its
extent
there
could
be
one
single
spot
capable
of
affording
a
layelah
information
with
regard
to
magones
had
made
that
much
plain
i
had
not
taken
in
her
full
meaning
but
now
mine
eyes
had
seen
it
yet
where
else
could
we
go
almah
could
not
tell
where
under
the
sky
lay
that
land
which
she
loved
i
could
not
guess
where
to
go
to
find
the
land
of
the
orin
even
if
i
did
know
i
did
not
feel
able
to
guide
the
course
of
the
athaleb
and
i
felt
sure
that
if
we
were
to
mount
again
the
mighty
monster
would
wing
his
flight
back
to
the
very
place
from
which
we
had
escaped
the
amir
these
thoughts
weighed
down
our
spirits
we
felt
that
we
had
gained
nothing
by
our
flight
and
that
our
future
was
dark
indeed
the
only
hope
left
us
was
that
we
might
be
able
to
guide
the
course
of
the
athaleb
in
some
different
direction
altogether
so
that
we
should
not
be
carried
back
to
the
kosekin
and
now
worn
out
by
the
long
fatigues
of
this
jom
we
thought
of
sleep
almah
lay
down
upon
the
sand
and
i
seated
myself
leaning
against
a
rock
a
little
distance
off
having
first
reloaded
my
rifle
and
pistol
chapter
xxiv
recapture
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
in
the
midst
of
my
sleep
there
sounded
voices
which
at
first
intermingled
themselves
with
my
dreams
but
gradually
became
separate
and
sounded
from
without
rousing
me
from
my
slumbers
i
opened
my
eyes
drowsily
but
the
sight
that
i
saw
was
so
amazing
that
in
an
instant
all
sleep
left
me
i
started
to
my
feet
and
gazed
in
utter
bewilderment
upon
the
scene
before
me
the
aurora
light
was
shining
with
unusual
brilliancy
and
disclosed
everything
the
sea
the
shore
the
athaleb
the
jantannin
the
promontory
all
more
plainly
and
more
luminously
than
before
but
it
was
not
any
of
these
things
that
now
excited
my
attention
and
rendered
me
dumb
i
saw
almah
standing
there
at
a
little
distance
with
despairing
face
surrounded
by
a
band
of
armed
kosekin
while
immediately
before
me
regarding
me
with
a
keen
glance
and
an
air
of
triumph
was
layelah
ataesmzori
alonla
said
she
with
a
sweet
smile
giving
me
the
usual
salutation
of
the
kosekin
i
was
too
bewildered
to
say
a
word
and
stood
mute
as
before
looking
first
at
her
and
then
at
almah
the
sight
of
almah
a
prisoner
once
more
surrounded
by
the
kosekin
excited
me
to
madness
i
seized
my
rifle
and
raised
it
as
if
to
take
aim
but
almah
who
understood
the
movement
cried
to
me
put
down
your
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
the
kosekin
are
too
numerous
said
layelah
what
do
you
mean
by
that
if
your
has
any
power
do
not
try
to
use
it
or
else
i
shall
have
to
order
my
followers
to
give
to
almah
the
blessing
of
death
at
this
my
rifle
was
lowered
the
whole
truth
flashed
upon
me
and
i
saw
too
the
madness
of
resistance
i
might
kill
one
or
two
but
the
rest
would
do
as
layelah
said
and
i
should
speedily
be
disarmed
well
i
knew
how
powerless
were
the
thunders
of
my
to
terrify
these
kosekin
for
the
prospect
of
death
would
only
rouse
them
to
a
mad
enthusiasm
and
they
would
all
rush
upon
me
as
they
would
rush
upon
a
jantannin
to
slay
and
be
slain
the
odds
were
too
great
a
crowd
of
europeans
could
be
held
in
check
far
more
easily
than
these
kosekin
the
whole
truth
was
thus
plain
we
were
prisoners
and
were
at
their
mercy
layelah
showed
no
excitement
or
anger
whatever
she
looked
and
spoke
in
her
usual
gracious
and
amiable
fashion
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
face
we
knew
said
she
that
you
would
be
in
distress
in
this
desolate
place
and
that
you
would
not
know
where
to
go
from
magones
and
so
we
have
come
full
of
the
most
eager
desire
to
relieve
your
wants
we
have
brought
with
us
food
and
drink
and
are
ready
to
do
everything
for
you
that
you
may
desire
we
have
had
great
trouble
in
finding
you
and
have
coursed
over
the
shores
for
vast
distances
and
far
over
the
interior
but
our
athalebs
found
you
at
last
by
their
scent
and
we
rejoice
to
have
found
you
in
time
and
that
you
are
both
so
well
for
we
have
been
afraid
that
you
had
been
suffering
nay
do
not
thank
us
thanks
are
distasteful
to
the
kosekin
these
brave
followers
of
mine
will
all
be
amply
rewarded
for
this
for
they
will
all
be
made
paupers
but
as
for
myself
i
want
no
higher
reward
than
the
delightful
thought
that
i
have
saved
you
from
suffering
the
beautiful
smiling
layelah
who
addressed
me
in
this
way
with
her
sweet
voice
was
certainly
not
to
be
treated
as
an
enemy
against
her
a
rifle
could
not
be
levelled
she
would
have
looked
at
me
with
the
same
sweet
smile
and
that
smile
would
have
melted
all
my
resolution
nor
could
i
even
persist
in
my
determination
to
remain
remain
for
what
for
utter
despair
and
yet
where
else
could
we
go
you
do
not
know
where
lie
the
lands
of
the
orin
said
layelah
the
athaleb
does
not
know
you
could
not
guide
him
if
you
did
know
you
are
helpless
on
his
back
the
art
of
driving
an
athaleb
is
difficult
and
can
not
be
learned
without
long
and
severe
practice
my
fear
was
that
the
athaleb
might
break
away
from
you
and
return
leaving
you
to
perish
here
had
you
tried
to
leave
this
place
he
would
have
brought
you
back
to
the
amir
to
this
i
said
nothing
partly
because
it
was
so
true
that
i
had
no
answer
to
make
and
partly
also
out
of
deep
mortification
and
dejection
my
pride
was
wounded
at
being
thus
so
easily
baffled
by
a
girl
like
layelah
and
all
my
grief
was
stirred
by
the
sadness
of
almah
in
her
eyes
there
seemed
even
now
the
look
of
one
who
sees
death
inevitable
and
the
glance
she
gave
to
me
was
like
an
eternal
farewell
almah
now
spoke
addressing
herself
to
layelah
death
said
she
in
a
voice
of
indescribable
mournfulness
is
better
here
than
with
you
we
would
rather
die
here
than
go
back
let
us
i
pray
you
receive
the
blessing
of
death
here
let
us
be
paupers
and
exiles
and
die
on
magones
layelah
heard
this
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
deep
thought
no
one
but
a
stranger
said
she
at
length
would
ask
such
a
favor
as
that
do
you
not
know
that
what
you
ask
is
among
the
very
highest
honors
of
the
kosekin
who
am
i
that
i
can
venture
to
grant
such
a
request
as
that
ask
for
anything
in
my
power
and
i
will
be
glad
to
grant
it
i
have
already
arranged
that
you
shall
be
separated
from
and
that
surely
is
a
high
privilege
i
might
consent
to
bind
you
hand
and
foot
after
the
manner
of
the
more
distinguished
asirin
you
may
also
be
blindfolded
if
you
wish
it
i
might
even
promise
after
we
return
to
the
amir
to
keep
you
confined
in
utter
darkness
with
barely
sufficient
food
to
keep
you
alive
until
the
time
of
the
sacrifice
in
short
there
is
no
blessing
known
among
the
kosekin
that
i
will
not
give
so
long
as
it
is
in
my
power
and
so
beloved
almah
continued
layelah
you
have
every
reason
for
happiness
you
have
all
the
highest
blessings
known
among
the
kosekin
separation
from
your
lover
poverty
want
darkness
and
finally
the
prospect
of
inevitable
death
ever
before
you
as
the
crowning
glory
of
your
lot
these
words
seemed
to
the
kosekin
the
very
excess
of
magnanimity
and
involuntary
murmurs
of
admiration
escaped
them
although
it
is
just
possible
that
they
murmured
at
the
greatness
of
the
favor
that
was
offered
but
to
me
it
sounded
like
fiendish
mockery
and
to
almah
it
sounded
the
same
for
a
groan
escaped
her
her
fortitude
gave
way
she
sank
on
her
knees
buried
her
head
in
her
hands
and
wept
almah
cried
i
in
a
fury
we
will
not
go
back
we
will
not
be
separated
i
will
destroy
all
the
athalebs
and
we
shall
all
perish
here
together
at
least
you
and
i
will
not
be
separated
at
this
almah
started
up
no
no
said
she
no
let
us
go
back
here
we
have
nothing
but
death
but
we
have
death
also
at
the
amir
and
a
more
terrible
one
said
i
if
you
kill
the
athalebs
said
layelah
i
will
give
almah
the
blessing
of
death
at
this
i
recoiled
in
horror
and
my
resolution
again
gave
way
you
have
some
mysterious
power
of
conferring
death
continued
layelah
with
what
almah
calls
your
but
do
not
kill
the
athalebs
for
it
will
do
you
no
good
almah
would
then
receive
the
blessing
of
death
my
followers
these
noble
kosekin
would
rejoice
in
thus
gaining
exile
and
death
on
magones
as
for
myself
it
would
be
my
highest
happiness
to
be
here
alone
with
you
with
you
i
should
live
for
a
few
sweet
joms
and
with
you
i
should
die
so
go
on
kill
the
athalebs
if
you
wish
do
not
cried
almah
do
not
there
is
no
hope
we
are
their
prisoners
and
our
only
hope
is
in
submission
upon
this
all
further
thought
of
resistance
left
me
and
i
stood
in
silence
stolidly
waiting
for
their
action
as
i
looked
around
i
noticed
a
movement
near
the
jantannin
and
saw
several
athalebs
there
which
were
devouring
its
flesh
i
now
went
over
to
almah
and
spoke
with
her
we
were
both
full
of
despair
it
seemed
as
though
we
might
never
meet
again
we
were
to
be
separated
now
but
who
could
say
whether
we
should
be
permitted
to
see
each
other
after
leaving
this
place
we
had
but
little
to
say
i
held
her
in
my
arms
regardless
of
the
presence
of
others
and
these
seeing
our
emotion
at
once
moved
away
with
the
usual
delicacy
of
the
kosekin
and
followed
layelah
to
the
jantannin
to
see
about
the
athalebs
at
last
our
interview
was
terminated
layelah
came
and
informed
us
that
all
was
ready
for
our
departure
we
walked
sadly
to
the
place
and
found
the
athalebs
crouched
to
receive
their
riders
there
were
four
beside
ours
layelah
informed
me
that
i
was
to
go
with
her
and
almah
was
to
go
on
another
athaleb
i
entreated
her
to
let
almah
go
with
me
but
she
declined
saying
that
our
athaleb
could
only
carry
two
as
he
seemed
fatigued
and
it
would
not
be
safe
to
overload
him
for
so
long
a
flight
i
told
her
that
almah
and
i
could
go
together
on
the
same
athaleb
but
she
objected
on
the
ground
of
my
ignorance
of
driving
and
so
remonstrances
and
objections
being
alike
useless
i
was
compelled
to
yield
to
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
almah
mounted
on
another
athaleb
i
mounted
with
layelah
and
then
the
great
monsters
expanded
their
mighty
wings
rose
into
the
air
and
soon
were
speeding
over
the
waters
we
went
on
in
silence
for
some
time
i
was
too
despondent
to
say
a
word
and
all
my
thoughts
turned
toward
almah
who
was
now
separated
from
me
perhaps
forever
the
other
athalebs
went
ahead
at
long
intervals
apart
flying
in
a
straight
line
while
ours
was
last
layelah
said
nothing
she
sat
in
front
of
me
her
back
was
turned
toward
me
she
held
in
her
hands
the
reins
which
hung
quite
loose
at
first
but
after
a
while
she
drew
them
up
and
seemed
to
be
directing
our
course
for
some
time
i
did
not
notice
anything
in
particular
for
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
athaleb
immediately
before
us
upon
which
was
seated
the
loved
form
of
almah
which
i
could
easily
recognize
but
our
athaleb
flew
slowly
and
i
noticed
that
we
were
falling
behind
i
said
this
to
layelah
but
she
only
remarked
that
it
was
fatigued
with
its
long
journey
to
this
i
objected
that
the
others
had
made
as
long
a
journey
and
insisted
that
she
should
draw
nearer
this
she
at
first
refused
to
do
but
at
length
as
i
grew
persistent
she
complied
or
pretended
to
do
so
in
spite
of
this
however
we
again
fell
behind
and
i
noticed
that
this
always
happened
when
the
reins
were
drawn
tight
on
making
this
discovery
i
suddenly
seized
both
reins
and
let
them
trail
loose
whereupon
the
athaleb
at
once
showed
a
perceptible
increase
of
speed
which
proved
that
there
was
no
fatigue
in
him
whatever
this
i
said
to
layelah
she
acquiesced
with
a
sweet
smile
and
taking
the
reins
again
she
sat
around
so
as
to
face
me
and
said
you
are
very
quick
it
is
no
use
to
try
to
deceive
you
i
wish
to
fall
behind
why
to
save
you
to
save
me
yes
i
can
take
you
to
the
land
of
the
orin
now
is
the
time
to
escape
from
death
if
you
go
back
you
must
surely
die
but
now
if
you
will
be
guided
by
me
i
can
take
you
to
the
land
of
the
orin
there
they
all
hate
death
they
love
life
they
live
in
the
light
there
you
will
find
those
who
are
like
yourself
there
you
can
love
and
be
happy
but
what
of
almah
i
asked
layelah
made
a
pretty
gesture
of
despair
you
are
always
talking
of
almah
said
she
what
is
almah
to
you
she
is
cold
dull
sad
she
never
will
speak
let
her
go
never
said
i
almah
is
worth
more
than
all
the
world
to
me
layelah
sighed
i
can
never
never
never
said
she
get
from
you
the
least
little
bit
of
a
kind
word
even
after
all
that
i
have
done
for
you
and
when
you
know
that
i
would
lie
down
and
let
you
trample
me
under
your
feet
if
it
gave
you
any
pleasure
oh
that
is
not
the
question
at
all
said
i
you
are
asking
me
to
leave
almah
to
be
false
to
her
and
i
can
not
among
the
kosekin
said
layelah
it
is
the
highest
happiness
for
lovers
to
give
one
another
up
i
am
not
one
of
the
kosekin
said
i
i
can
not
let
her
go
away
i
can
not
let
her
go
back
to
the
amir
to
meet
death
alone
if
she
dies
she
shall
see
me
by
her
side
ready
to
die
with
her
at
this
layelah
laughed
merrily
is
it
possible
said
she
that
you
believe
that
do
you
not
know
that
if
almah
goes
back
alone
she
will
not
die
what
do
you
mean
why
she
can
only
die
when
you
are
in
her
company
she
has
lived
for
years
among
us
and
we
have
waited
for
someone
to
appear
whom
she
might
love
so
that
we
might
give
them
both
the
blessing
of
death
if
that
one
should
leave
her
almah
could
not
receive
the
blessing
she
would
be
compelled
to
live
longer
until
some
other
lover
should
appear
now
by
going
with
me
to
the
land
of
the
orin
you
will
save
almah
life
and
as
for
almah
why
she
will
be
happy
and
dear
papa
is
quite
willing
to
marry
her
you
must
see
therefore
dear
that
my
plan
is
the
very
best
that
can
be
thought
of
for
all
of
us
and
above
all
for
almah
this
however
was
intolerable
and
i
could
not
consent
to
desert
almah
even
if
by
doing
so
i
should
save
her
life
my
own
nature
revolted
from
it
still
it
was
not
a
thing
which
i
could
dismiss
on
the
instant
the
safety
of
almah
life
indeed
required
consideration
but
then
the
thought
came
of
her
wonder
at
my
desertion
would
she
not
think
me
false
would
not
the
thought
of
my
falsity
be
worse
than
death
no
said
i
i
will
not
leave
her
not
even
to
save
her
life
even
among
us
there
are
things
worse
than
death
almah
would
rather
die
by
the
sacrificial
knife
than
linger
on
with
a
broken
heart
oh
no
said
layelah
sweetly
she
will
rejoice
that
you
are
safe
do
you
not
see
that
while
you
are
together
death
is
inevitable
but
if
you
separate
you
may
both
live
and
be
happy
but
she
will
think
me
dead
said
i
as
a
new
idea
occurred
she
will
think
that
some
accident
has
befallen
me
oh
no
she
wo
said
layelah
she
will
think
that
you
have
gone
off
with
me
then
that
will
be
worse
and
i
would
rather
die
and
have
her
die
with
me
than
live
and
have
her
think
me
false
you
are
very
very
obstinate
said
layelah
sweetly
i
made
no
reply
during
this
conversation
i
had
been
too
intent
upon
layelah
words
to
notice
the
athalebs
before
me
but
now
as
i
looked
up
i
saw
that
we
had
fallen
far
behind
and
that
layelah
had
headed
our
athaleb
in
a
new
direction
upon
this
i
once
more
snatched
the
reins
from
her
and
tried
to
return
to
our
former
course
this
however
i
was
utterly
unable
to
do
layelah
laughed
you
will
have
to
let
me
guide
our
course
said
she
you
can
do
nothing
the
athaleb
will
now
go
in
a
straight
line
to
the
land
of
the
orin
upon
this
i
started
up
in
wild
excitement
never
never
never
i
cried
in
a
fury
i
will
not
i
will
destroy
this
athaleb
and
perish
in
the
water
as
i
said
this
i
raised
my
rifle
what
are
you
going
to
do
cried
layelah
in
accents
of
fear
turn
back
i
cried
or
i
will
kill
this
athaleb
upon
this
layelah
dropped
the
reins
stood
up
and
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
oh
said
she
what
a
thing
to
ask
how
can
i
go
back
now
when
we
have
started
for
the
land
of
the
orin
we
shall
never
reach
the
land
of
the
orin
i
cried
we
shall
perish
in
the
sea
oh
no
said
layelah
you
can
not
kill
the
athaleb
you
are
no
more
than
an
insect
your
rod
is
a
weak
thing
and
will
break
on
his
iron
frame
it
was
evident
that
layelah
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
powers
of
my
rifle
there
was
no
hesitation
on
my
part
i
took
aim
with
the
rifle
at
that
moment
i
was
desperate
i
thought
of
nothing
but
the
swift
flight
of
the
athaleb
which
was
bearing
me
away
forever
from
almah
i
could
not
endure
that
thought
and
still
less
could
i
endure
the
thought
that
she
should
believe
me
false
it
was
therefore
in
a
wild
passion
of
rage
and
despair
that
i
levelled
my
rifle
taking
aim
as
well
as
i
could
at
what
seemed
a
vital
part
under
the
wing
the
motion
of
the
wing
rendered
this
difficult
however
and
i
hesitated
a
moment
so
as
to
make
sure
all
this
time
layelah
stood
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
on
her
rosy
lips
and
a
merry
twinkle
in
her
eyes
evidently
regarding
my
words
as
empty
threats
and
my
act
as
a
vain
pretence
and
utterly
unprepared
for
what
was
to
follow
suddenly
i
fired
both
barrels
in
quick
succession
the
reports
rang
out
in
thunder
over
the
sea
the
athaleb
gave
a
wild
appalling
shriek
and
fell
straight
down
into
the
water
fluttering
vainly
with
one
wing
while
the
other
hung
down
useless
a
shriek
of
horror
burst
from
layelah
she
started
back
and
fell
from
her
into
the
waves
beneath
the
next
instant
we
were
all
in
the
water
together
the
athaleb
writhing
and
lashing
the
water
into
foam
while
i
involuntarily
clung
to
his
coarse
mane
and
expected
death
every
moment
but
death
did
not
come
for
the
athaleb
did
not
sink
but
floated
with
his
back
out
of
the
water
the
right
pinion
being
sunk
underneath
and
useless
and
the
left
struggling
vainly
with
the
sea
but
after
a
time
he
folded
up
the
left
wing
and
drew
it
close
in
to
his
side
and
propelled
himself
with
his
long
his
right
wing
was
broken
but
he
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
any
other
injury
suddenly
i
heard
a
cry
behind
me
oh
i
looked
around
and
saw
layelah
she
was
swimming
in
the
water
and
seemed
exhausted
in
the
agitation
of
the
past
few
moments
i
had
lost
sight
of
her
and
had
thought
that
she
was
drowned
but
now
the
sight
of
her
roused
me
from
my
stupor
and
brought
me
back
to
myself
she
was
swimming
yet
her
strokes
were
weak
and
her
face
was
full
of
despair
in
an
instant
i
had
flung
off
my
coat
rolled
up
the
rifle
and
pistol
in
its
folds
and
sprung
into
the
water
a
few
strokes
brought
me
to
layelah
a
moment
more
and
i
should
have
been
too
late
i
held
her
head
out
of
water
told
her
not
to
struggle
and
then
struck
out
to
go
back
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
do
this
encumbered
with
such
a
load
had
i
not
fortunately
perceived
the
floating
wing
of
the
athaleb
close
beside
me
this
i
seized
and
by
means
of
it
drew
myself
with
layelah
alongside
after
which
i
succeeded
in
putting
her
on
the
back
of
the
animal
and
soon
followed
myself
the
terror
of
the
rifle
had
overwhelmed
her
and
the
suddenness
of
the
catastrophe
had
almost
killed
her
she
had
struggled
in
the
water
for
a
long
time
and
had
called
to
me
in
vain
now
she
was
quite
exhausted
and
lay
in
my
arms
trembling
and
sobbing
i
spoke
to
her
encouragingly
and
wrapped
her
in
my
coat
and
rubbed
her
hands
and
feet
until
at
last
she
began
to
recover
then
she
wept
quietly
for
a
long
time
then
the
weeping
fit
passed
away
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
and
in
her
face
there
was
unutterable
gratitude
said
she
i
never
loved
death
like
the
rest
of
the
kosekin
but
now
but
now
i
feel
that
death
with
you
would
be
sweet
then
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
i
found
tears
coming
to
my
own
so
that
i
had
to
stoop
down
and
kiss
away
the
tears
of
layelah
as
i
did
so
she
twined
both
her
arms
around
my
neck
held
me
close
to
her
and
sighed
oh
death
with
you
is
sweet
and
now
you
can
not
reproach
me
you
have
done
this
yourself
with
your
terrible
power
and
you
have
saved
my
life
to
let
me
die
with
you
you
do
not
hate
me
then
do
you
just
speak
once
to
a
poor
little
girl
and
say
that
you
do
not
hate
her
all
this
was
very
pitiable
what
man
that
had
a
heart
in
his
breast
could
listen
unmoved
to
words
like
these
or
look
without
emotion
upon
one
so
beautiful
so
gentle
and
so
tender
it
was
no
longer
layelah
in
triumph
with
whom
i
had
to
do
but
layelah
in
distress
the
light
banter
the
teasing
mocking
smile
the
kindling
eye
the
ready
laugh
all
were
gone
there
was
nothing
now
but
mournful
tenderness
the
timid
appeal
of
one
who
dreaded
a
repulse
the
glance
of
deep
affection
the
abandonment
of
love
i
held
layelah
in
my
arms
and
i
thought
of
nothing
now
but
words
of
consolation
for
her
life
seemed
over
death
seemed
inevitable
and
there
on
the
back
of
the
athaleb
we
floated
on
the
waters
and
waited
for
our
doom
chapter
xxv
falling
like
icarus
into
the
sea
the
aurora
light
which
had
flamed
brightly
was
now
extinct
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
where
we
floated
on
the
back
of
the
monster
he
swam
forcing
himself
onward
with
his
with
one
broad
wing
folded
up
close
had
both
been
folded
up
the
athaleb
could
have
swum
rapidly
but
the
broken
wing
lay
expanded
over
the
water
tossing
with
the
waves
so
that
our
progress
was
but
slight
had
it
not
been
for
this
the
athaleb
own
instinct
might
have
served
to
guide
him
toward
some
shore
which
we
might
have
hoped
to
reach
before
life
was
extinct
but
as
it
was
all
thought
of
reaching
any
shore
was
out
of
the
question
and
there
arose
before
us
only
the
prospect
of
death
a
death
too
which
must
be
lingering
and
painful
and
cruel
thus
amid
the
darkness
we
floated
and
the
waves
dashed
around
us
and
the
athaleb
never
ceased
to
struggle
in
the
water
trying
to
force
his
way
onward
it
seemed
sweet
at
that
moment
to
have
layelah
with
me
for
what
could
have
been
more
horrible
than
loneliness
amid
those
black
waters
and
layelah
mind
was
made
up
to
meet
death
with
joy
so
that
her
mood
conveyed
itself
to
me
and
i
thought
that
since
death
was
inevitable
it
were
better
to
meet
it
thus
and
in
this
way
end
my
life
not
amid
the
horrors
of
the
sacrifice
and
the
mista
kosek
but
in
a
way
which
seemed
natural
to
a
seafaring
man
like
myself
and
with
which
i
had
long
familiarized
my
thoughts
for
i
had
fallen
upon
a
world
and
among
people
which
were
all
alien
and
unintelligible
to
me
and
to
live
on
would
only
open
the
way
to
new
and
worse
calamities
there
was
peace
also
in
the
thought
that
my
death
would
snatch
the
prospect
of
death
from
almah
she
would
now
be
safe
it
was
only
when
we
were
together
as
lovers
that
death
threatened
her
but
now
since
i
was
removed
she
could
resume
her
former
life
and
she
might
remember
me
only
as
an
episode
in
that
life
that
she
would
remember
me
i
felt
sure
and
that
she
would
weep
for
me
and
mourn
after
me
was
undeniable
but
time
as
it
passed
would
surely
alleviate
that
grief
and
almah
would
live
and
be
happy
perhaps
she
might
yet
regain
her
native
land
and
rejoin
her
loved
kindred
whom
she
would
tell
of
the
stranger
from
an
unknown
shore
who
had
loved
her
and
through
whose
death
she
had
gained
her
life
such
were
the
thoughts
that
filled
my
mind
as
i
floated
over
the
black
water
with
darkness
all
around
as
i
held
layelah
in
my
arms
with
my
coat
wrapped
around
her
and
murmured
in
her
ear
tender
words
of
consolation
and
sympathy
a
long
long
time
had
passed
but
how
long
i
know
not
when
suddenly
layelah
gave
a
cry
and
started
up
on
her
knees
with
her
head
bent
forward
listening
intently
i
too
listened
and
i
could
distinctly
hear
the
sound
of
breakers
it
was
evident
that
we
were
approaching
some
shore
and
from
what
i
remembered
of
the
shore
of
magones
such
a
shore
meant
death
and
death
alone
we
stood
up
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
gloom
at
length
we
saw
a
whole
line
of
breakers
and
beyond
all
was
black
we
waited
anxiously
in
that
position
and
drew
steadily
nearer
it
was
evident
that
the
athaleb
was
desirous
of
reaching
that
shore
and
we
could
do
nothing
but
await
the
result
but
the
athaleb
had
his
wits
about
him
and
swam
along
on
a
line
with
the
breakers
for
some
distance
until
at
length
an
opening
appeared
into
which
he
directed
his
course
passing
through
this
we
reached
still
water
which
seemed
like
a
lagoon
surrounded
by
a
coral
reef
the
athaleb
swam
on
farther
and
at
length
we
saw
before
us
an
island
with
a
broad
sandy
beach
beyond
which
was
the
shadowy
outline
of
a
forest
here
the
monster
landed
and
dragged
himself
wearily
upon
the
sand
where
he
spread
his
vast
bulk
out
and
lay
panting
heavily
we
dismounted
i
first
so
as
to
assist
layelah
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
death
were
postponed
for
a
time
since
we
had
reached
this
place
where
the
rich
and
rank
vegetation
spoke
of
nothing
but
vigorous
life
fortune
had
indeed
dealt
strangely
with
me
i
had
fled
with
almah
and
with
her
had
reached
one
desolate
shore
and
now
i
found
myself
with
layelah
upon
another
shore
desolate
also
but
not
a
savage
wilderness
this
lonely
island
ringed
with
the
black
ocean
waters
was
the
abode
of
a
life
of
its
own
and
there
was
nothing
here
to
crush
the
soul
into
a
horror
of
despair
like
that
which
was
caused
by
the
tremendous
scenes
on
magones
in
an
instant
layelah
revived
from
her
gloom
she
looked
around
clapped
her
little
hands
laughed
aloud
and
danced
for
joy
oh
she
cried
see
see
the
trees
see
the
grass
the
bushes
this
is
a
land
of
wonder
as
for
food
you
can
call
it
down
from
the
sky
with
your
or
we
can
find
it
on
the
rocks
oh
life
is
better
than
death
and
we
can
live
here
and
we
can
be
happy
this
shall
be
better
to
us
than
the
lands
of
the
orin
for
we
shall
be
alone
and
we
shall
be
all
in
all
to
one
another
i
could
not
help
laughing
and
i
said
layelah
this
is
not
the
language
of
the
kosekin
you
should
at
once
go
to
the
other
side
of
this
island
and
sit
down
and
wait
for
death
never
said
layelah
you
are
mine
and
i
never
will
leave
you
if
you
wish
me
to
die
for
you
i
will
gladly
lay
down
my
life
but
i
will
not
leave
you
i
love
you
and
now
whether
it
be
life
or
death
it
is
all
the
same
so
long
as
i
have
you
our
submersion
in
the
sea
and
our
long
exposure
afterward
had
chilled
both
of
us
but
layelah
felt
it
most
she
was
shivering
in
her
wet
clothes
in
spite
of
my
coat
which
i
insisted
on
her
wearing
and
i
determined
if
possible
to
kindle
a
fire
fortunately
my
powder
was
dry
for
i
had
thrown
off
my
flask
with
my
coat
before
jumping
into
the
sea
and
thus
i
had
the
means
of
creating
fire
i
rubbed
wet
powder
over
my
handkerchief
and
then
gathered
some
dried
sticks
and
moss
after
this
i
found
some
dead
trees
the
boughs
of
which
were
dry
and
brittle
and
in
the
exercise
i
soon
grew
warm
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
a
great
heap
of
fagots
accumulating
i
fired
my
pistol
into
the
handkerchief
which
being
saturated
with
powder
caught
the
fire
and
this
i
blew
into
a
flame
among
the
dried
moss
a
bright
fire
now
sprang
up
and
blazed
high
in
the
air
while
i
in
order
to
have
an
ample
supply
of
fuel
continued
to
gather
it
for
a
long
time
at
length
as
i
came
back
i
saw
layelah
lying
on
the
sand
in
front
of
the
fire
sound
asleep
i
was
glad
of
this
for
she
was
weary
and
had
seemed
so
weak
and
tremulous
that
i
had
felt
anxious
so
now
i
arranged
my
coat
over
her
carefully
and
then
sat
down
for
a
time
to
think
over
this
new
turn
which
my
fortune
had
taken
this
island
was
certainly
very
unlike
magones
yet
i
had
no
surety
but
that
it
might
be
equally
destitute
of
food
this
was
the
first
question
and
i
could
not
think
of
sleep
until
i
had
found
out
more
about
the
place
the
aurora
light
which
constantly
brightens
and
lessens
in
this
strange
world
was
now
shining
gloriously
and
i
set
forth
to
explore
the
island
the
beach
was
of
fine
sand
all
the
way
the
water
was
smooth
and
shut
in
on
every
side
by
an
outer
reef
against
which
the
broke
incessantly
as
i
walked
i
soon
perceived
what
the
island
was
for
i
had
often
seen
such
places
before
in
the
south
pacific
it
was
in
fact
a
coral
islet
with
a
reef
of
rocks
encircling
it
on
every
side
the
vegetation
however
was
unlike
anything
in
the
world
beyond
for
it
consisted
of
many
varieties
of
that
looked
like
palms
and
giant
grasses
and
bamboo
the
island
was
but
small
and
the
entire
circuit
was
not
over
a
mile
i
saw
nothing
that
looked
like
food
nor
did
it
seem
likely
that
in
so
small
a
place
there
could
be
enough
sustenance
for
us
our
only
hope
would
be
from
the
sea
yet
even
here
i
could
see
no
signs
of
any
sort
of
on
the
whole
the
prospect
was
discouraging
and
i
returned
to
the
with
a
feeling
of
dejection
but
this
feeling
did
not
trouble
me
much
at
that
time
my
chief
thought
was
of
rest
and
i
flung
myself
down
on
the
sand
and
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
by
a
cry
from
layelah
starting
up
i
saw
her
standing
and
looking
into
the
sky
she
was
intensely
excited
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
rushed
toward
me
and
burst
into
tears
while
i
full
of
wonder
could
only
stare
upward
oh
cried
layelah
they
turned
back
they
found
us
we
shall
have
to
leave
our
dear
lovely
island
oh
i
shall
lose
you
now
for
never
never
never
again
will
you
have
one
thought
of
love
for
your
poor
layelah
with
these
words
she
clung
sobbing
to
me
for
my
part
i
do
not
remember
what
i
said
to
soothe
her
for
the
sight
above
was
so
amazing
that
it
took
up
all
my
attention
the
aurora
shone
bright
and
in
the
sky
i
saw
two
vast
objects
wheeling
and
circling
as
if
about
to
descend
i
recognized
them
at
once
as
athalebs
but
as
their
backs
were
hid
from
view
by
their
immense
wings
i
could
not
make
out
whether
they
were
wanderers
about
to
alight
of
their
own
accord
or
guided
here
by
riders
perhaps
by
the
kosekin
from
whom
we
had
been
parted
this
much
at
least
i
remember
i
said
to
layelah
that
these
athalebs
were
wild
ones
which
had
come
here
because
they
saw
or
scented
our
wounded
one
but
layelah
shook
her
head
with
mournful
meaning
oh
no
said
she
almah
has
come
back
for
you
this
has
guided
them
if
you
had
not
made
the
fire
they
never
never
never
could
have
found
us
but
now
all
is
lost
there
was
no
time
for
conversation
or
discussion
the
athalebs
drew
swiftly
nearer
and
nearer
descending
in
long
circuits
until
at
length
they
touched
the
ground
not
far
away
on
the
wide
sandy
beach
then
we
saw
people
on
their
backs
and
among
them
was
almah
we
hurried
toward
them
and
almah
rushed
into
my
arms
to
the
great
disgust
of
layelah
for
she
was
close
beside
me
and
saw
it
all
she
gave
an
exclamation
of
grief
and
despair
and
hurried
away
from
almah
i
learned
that
our
disappearance
had
caused
alarm
that
two
of
the
athalebs
had
come
back
in
search
of
us
that
they
had
been
to
magones
and
had
searched
over
the
seas
and
were
just
about
giving
us
up
as
lost
when
the
had
attracted
their
attention
and
drawn
them
here
i
said
nothing
at
that
time
about
the
cause
of
our
disappearance
but
merely
remarked
that
the
athaleb
had
fallen
into
the
sea
and
swam
here
this
was
sufficient
they
had
to
remain
here
for
some
time
longer
to
rest
their
athalebs
at
length
we
prepared
to
depart
our
wounded
athaleb
was
left
behind
to
take
care
of
himself
i
was
taken
with
almah
and
layelah
went
on
the
other
we
were
thus
separated
and
so
we
set
forth
upon
our
return
and
at
length
arrived
at
the
amir
chapter
xxvi
grimm
law
again
dinner
was
now
announced
and
oxenden
laid
the
manuscript
aside
whereupon
they
adjourned
to
the
cabin
where
they
proceeded
to
discuss
both
the
repast
and
the
manuscript
well
said
featherstone
more
story
seems
to
be
approaching
a
crisis
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
melick
do
you
still
think
it
a
sensational
novel
partly
so
said
melick
but
it
would
be
nearer
the
mark
to
call
it
a
satirical
romance
why
not
a
scientific
romance
because
there
precious
little
science
in
it
but
a
good
deal
of
quiet
satire
satire
on
what
asked
featherstone
i
be
hanged
if
i
can
see
it
oh
well
said
melick
on
things
in
general
the
satire
is
directed
against
the
restlessness
of
humanity
its
impulses
feelings
hopes
and
fears
all
that
men
do
and
feel
and
suffer
it
mocks
us
by
exhibiting
a
new
race
of
men
animated
by
passions
and
impulses
which
are
directly
the
opposite
of
ours
and
yet
no
nearer
happiness
than
we
are
it
shows
us
a
world
where
our
evil
is
made
a
good
and
our
good
an
evil
there
all
that
we
consider
a
blessing
is
had
in
abundance
prolonged
and
perpetual
sunlight
riches
power
fame
and
yet
these
things
are
despised
and
the
people
turning
away
from
them
imagine
that
they
can
find
happiness
in
poverty
darkness
death
and
unrequited
love
the
writer
thus
mocks
at
all
our
dearest
passions
and
strongest
desires
and
his
general
aim
is
to
show
that
the
mere
search
for
happiness
per
se
is
a
vulgar
thing
and
must
always
result
in
utter
nothingness
the
writer
also
teaches
the
great
lesson
that
the
happiness
of
man
consists
not
in
external
surroundings
but
in
the
internal
feelings
and
that
heaven
itself
is
not
a
place
but
a
state
it
is
the
old
lesson
which
milton
extorted
from
satan
matter
where
if
i
be
still
the
same
or
again
mind
is
its
own
place
and
of
itself
can
make
a
heaven
of
hell
a
hell
of
heaven
that
good
too
cried
oxenden
that
reminds
me
of
the
german
commentators
who
find
in
the
agamemnon
of
aeschylus
or
the
oedipus
of
sophocles
or
the
hamlet
of
shakespeare
motives
and
purposes
of
which
the
authors
could
never
have
dreamed
and
give
us
a
metaphysical
clytemnestra
or
antigone
or
lady
macbeth
no
my
boy
more
was
a
simple
sailor
and
had
no
idea
of
satirizing
anything
how
then
do
you
account
for
the
perpetual
undercurrent
of
meaning
and
innuendo
that
may
be
found
in
every
line
i
deny
that
there
is
anything
of
the
sort
said
oxenden
it
is
a
plain
narrative
of
facts
but
the
facts
are
themselves
such
that
they
give
a
new
coloring
to
the
facts
of
our
own
life
they
are
in
such
profound
antithesis
to
european
ways
that
we
consider
them
as
being
written
merely
to
indicate
that
difference
it
is
like
the
germania
of
tacitus
which
many
critics
still
hold
to
be
a
satire
on
roman
ways
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
simply
a
narrative
of
german
manners
and
customs
i
hope
cried
melick
that
you
do
not
mean
to
compare
this
awful
rot
and
rubbish
to
the
germania
of
tacitus
by
no
means
said
oxenden
i
merely
asserted
that
in
one
respect
they
were
analogous
you
forced
on
the
allusion
to
the
germania
by
calling
this
and
rubbish
a
satirical
romance
oh
well
said
melick
i
only
referred
to
the
intention
of
the
writer
his
plan
is
one
thing
and
his
execution
quite
another
his
plan
is
not
bad
but
he
fails
utterly
in
his
execution
the
style
is
detestable
if
he
had
written
in
the
style
of
a
plain
seaman
and
told
a
simple
unvarnished
tale
it
would
have
been
all
right
in
order
to
carry
out
properly
such
a
plan
as
this
the
writer
should
take
defoe
as
his
model
or
still
better
dean
swift
gulliver
travels
and
robinson
crusoe
show
what
can
be
done
in
this
way
and
form
a
standard
by
which
all
other
attempts
must
be
judged
but
this
writer
is
tawdry
he
has
the
worst
vices
of
the
sensational
school
he
shows
everywhere
marks
of
haste
gross
carelessness
and
universal
feebleness
when
he
gets
hold
of
a
good
fancy
he
lacks
the
patience
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
work
it
up
in
an
effective
way
he
is
a
gross
plagiarist
and
over
and
over
again
violates
in
the
most
glaring
manner
all
the
ordinary
proprieties
of
style
what
can
be
more
absurd
for
instance
than
the
language
which
he
puts
into
the
mouth
of
layelah
not
content
with
making
her
talk
like
a
sentimental
english
miss
he
actually
forgets
himself
so
far
as
to
put
in
her
mouth
a
threadbare
joke
which
everyone
has
heard
since
childhood
what
is
that
oh
that
silly
speech
about
the
athaleb
swallowing
its
victuals
whole
what
the
matter
with
that
asked
oxenden
it
merely
a
chance
resemblance
in
translating
her
words
into
english
they
fell
by
accident
into
that
shape
no
one
but
you
would
find
fault
with
them
would
it
have
been
better
if
he
had
translated
her
words
into
the
scientific
phraseology
which
the
doctor
made
use
of
with
regard
to
the
ichthyosaurus
he
might
have
made
it
this
way
it
bite
it
swallows
its
food
without
mastication
would
that
have
been
better
besides
it
all
very
well
to
talk
of
imitating
defoe
and
swift
but
suppose
he
could
do
it
then
he
should
have
written
the
book
in
that
case
how
could
his
father
have
heard
about
his
adventures
his
father
exclaimed
melick
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
still
accept
all
this
as
bona
fide
do
you
mean
to
say
retorted
oxenden
that
you
still
have
any
doubt
about
the
authenticity
of
this
remarkable
manuscript
at
this
each
looked
at
the
other
melick
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
oxenden
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
each
seemed
unable
to
find
words
to
express
his
amazement
at
the
other
stupidity
and
so
they
took
refuge
in
silence
what
do
you
understand
by
this
athaleb
doctor
asked
featherstone
the
athaleb
said
the
doctor
why
it
is
clearly
the
pterodactyl
interrupted
oxenden
do
please
take
notice
of
that
name
it
affords
another
exemplification
of
law
the
hebrew
word
is
and
means
bat
the
kosekin
word
is
here
you
see
the
thin
letter
of
hebrew
represented
by
the
aspirated
letter
of
the
kosekin
language
while
the
aspirated
hebrew
is
represented
by
the
kosekin
medial
too
true
exclaimed
melick
in
a
tone
of
deep
conviction
and
now
oxenden
wo
you
sing
us
a
song
nonsense
said
featherstone
let
the
doctor
tell
us
about
the
athaleb
well
resumed
the
doctor
as
i
was
saying
it
must
be
undoubtedly
the
pterodactyl
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
animal
and
is
a
species
of
flying
lizard
although
differing
from
the
lizard
in
many
respects
it
has
the
head
and
neck
of
a
bird
the
trunk
and
tail
of
an
ordinary
mammal
the
jaws
and
teeth
of
a
reptile
and
the
wings
of
a
bat
owen
describes
one
whose
sweep
of
wings
exceeded
twenty
feet
and
many
have
been
found
of
every
gradation
of
size
down
to
that
of
a
bat
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
as
large
as
more
says
and
i
for
my
part
do
not
suspect
him
of
exaggeration
some
have
supposed
that
a
late
lingering
individual
may
have
suggested
the
idea
of
the
fabulous
dragon
an
idea
which
seems
to
be
in
the
minds
of
nearly
all
the
human
race
for
in
the
early
records
of
many
nations
we
find
the
destruction
of
dragons
assigned
to
their
gods
and
heroes
the
figure
of
the
pterodactyl
represents
pretty
closely
that
which
is
given
to
the
dragons
it
is
not
impossible
that
they
may
have
existed
into
the
period
which
we
call
prehistoric
and
that
monsters
far
larger
than
any
which
we
have
yet
discovered
may
have
lingered
until
the
time
when
man
began
to
increase
upon
the
earth
to
spread
over
its
surface
and
to
carve
upon
wood
and
stone
representations
of
the
most
striking
objects
around
him
when
the
living
pterodactyls
had
disappeared
the
memory
of
them
was
preserved
some
new
features
were
added
and
the
imagination
went
so
far
as
to
endow
them
with
the
power
of
belching
forth
smoke
and
flames
thus
the
dragon
idea
pervaded
the
minds
of
men
and
instead
of
a
natural
animal
it
became
a
fabulous
one
the
fingers
of
the
forelegs
were
of
the
ordinary
dimensions
and
terminated
with
crooked
nails
and
these
were
probably
used
to
suspend
themselves
from
trees
when
in
repose
it
rested
on
its
hind
legs
like
a
bird
and
held
its
neck
curving
behind
so
that
its
enormous
head
should
not
disturb
its
equilibrium
the
size
and
form
of
the
feet
of
the
leg
and
of
the
thigh
prove
that
they
could
hold
themselves
erect
with
firmness
their
wings
folded
and
move
about
in
this
way
like
birds
just
as
more
describes
them
as
doing
like
birds
they
could
also
perch
on
trees
and
could
crawl
like
bats
and
lizards
along
the
rocks
and
cliffs
some
think
that
they
were
covered
with
scales
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
they
had
a
horny
hide
with
a
ridge
of
hair
running
down
their
backs
in
which
opinion
i
am
sustained
by
more
account
the
smaller
kinds
were
undoubtedly
insectivorous
but
the
larger
ones
must
have
been
carnivorous
and
probably
fed
largely
on
fish
well
at
any
rate
said
melick
gravely
this
athaleb
solves
the
difficult
question
as
to
how
the
troglodytes
emigrated
to
the
south
pole
how
asked
the
doctor
why
they
must
have
gone
there
on
athalebs
your
friends
the
pterodactyls
probably
lingered
longest
among
the
troglodytes
who
seeing
that
they
were
rapidly
dying
out
concluded
to
depart
to
another
and
a
better
world
one
beauty
of
this
theory
is
that
it
can
not
possibly
be
disproved
another
is
that
it
satisfies
all
the
requirements
of
the
case
a
third
is
that
it
accounts
for
the
disappearance
of
the
pterodactyls
in
our
world
and
their
appearance
at
the
south
pole
and
there
are
forty
or
fifty
other
facts
all
included
in
this
theory
which
i
have
not
time
just
now
to
enumerate
but
will
try
to
do
so
after
we
have
finished
reading
the
manuscript
i
will
only
add
that
the
athaleb
must
be
regarded
as
another
link
which
binds
the
kosekin
to
the
semitic
race
another
link
said
oxenden
that
i
already
have
and
it
is
one
that
carries
conviction
with
it
all
your
arguments
invariably
do
my
dear
fellow
what
is
it
asked
the
doctor
the
kosekin
alphabet
said
oxenden
i
ca
see
how
you
can
make
anything
out
of
that
said
the
doctor
very
well
i
can
easily
explain
replied
oxenden
in
the
first
place
we
must
take
the
old
hebrew
alphabet
i
will
write
down
the
letters
in
their
order
first
saying
this
he
hastily
jotted
down
some
letters
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
showed
to
the
doctor
the
following
labials
palatals
linguals
a
b
c
or
g
d
e
f
ch
or
h
dh
or
th
i
liquids
l
m
n
o
p
k
t
that
said
he
is
substantially
the
order
of
the
old
hebrew
alphabet
but
said
the
doctor
the
kosekin
alphabet
differs
in
its
order
altogether
from
that
that
very
difference
can
be
shown
to
be
all
the
stronger
proof
of
a
connection
between
them
said
oxenden
i
should
like
to
know
how
the
fact
is
said
oxenden
these
letters
are
represented
differently
in
the
two
languages
in
exact
accordance
with
law
by
jove
cried
featherstone
grimm
law
again
according
to
that
law
continued
oxenden
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
ought
to
change
their
order
now
let
us
leave
out
the
vowels
and
linguals
and
deal
only
with
the
mutes
first
we
have
in
the
hebrew
alphabet
the
medials
b
g
and
very
well
in
the
kosekin
we
have
standing
first
the
thin
letters
or
tenues
according
to
law
namely
p
k
next
we
have
in
the
hebrew
the
aspirates
f
ch
dh
in
the
kosekin
alphabet
we
have
corresponding
to
them
the
medials
b
g
next
we
have
in
the
hebrew
the
tenues
or
thin
letters
p
k
in
the
kosekin
we
have
the
corresponding
aspirates
f
ch
th
the
vowels
liquids
and
sibilants
need
not
be
regarded
just
here
for
the
proof
from
the
mutes
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
man
well
said
melick
i
for
one
am
thoroughly
satisfied
and
need
another
single
word
the
fact
is
i
never
knew
before
the
nature
of
grimm
law
why
it
can
unlock
any
mystery
when
i
get
home
i
must
buy
one
a
tame
one
if
possible
and
keep
him
with
me
always
it
is
more
useful
to
a
literary
man
than
to
any
other
it
is
said
that
with
a
knowledge
of
grimm
law
a
man
may
wander
through
the
world
from
iceland
to
ceylon
and
converse
pleasantly
in
all
the

more
must
have
had
grimm
law
stowed
away
somewhere
about
him
and
that
the
reason
why
he
escaped
the
icebergs
the
volcanoes
the
cannibals
the

monster
and
arrived
at
last
safe
and

in
the

of

what
i
want
is
grimm

a
nice
tidy
one

get
one

chapter
xxvii
oxenden
preaches
a
sermon
magones
said
the
doctor
is
clearly
a
volcanic
island
and
taken
in
connection
with
the
other
volcanoes
around
shows
how
active
must
be
the
subterranean
fires
at
the
south
pole
it
seems
probable
to
me
that
the
numerous
caves
of
the
kosekin
were
originally
fissures
in
the
mountains
formed
by
convulsions
of
nature
and
also
that
the
places
excavated
by
man
must
consist
of
soft
volcanic
rock
such
as
or
rather
tufa
easily
worked
and
remaining
permanently
in
any
shape
into
which
it
may
be
fashioned
as
to
magones
it
seems
another
iceland
for
there
are
the
same
wild
and
hideous
desolation
the
same
impassable
wildernesses
and
the
same
universal
scenes
of
ruin
lighted
up
by
the
baleful
and
tremendous
volcanic
fires
but
what
of
that
little
island
on
which
they
landed
asked
featherstone
that
surely
was
not
volcanic
no
said
the
doctor
that
must
have
been
a
coral
island
is
it
really
true
asked
featherstone
that
these
coral
islands
are
the
work
of
little
insects
well
they
may
be
called
insects
replied
the
doctor
they
are
living
zoophytes
of
most
minute
dimensions
which
however
compensate
for
their
smallness
of
size
by
their
inconceivable
numbers
small
as
these
are
they
have
accomplished
infinitely
more
than
all
that
ever
was
done
by
the
ichthyosaurus
the
plesiosaurus
the
pterodactyl
and
the
whole
tribe
of
monsters
that
once
filled
the
earth
immense
districts
and
whole
mountains
have
been
built
up
by
these
minute
creatures
they
have
been
at
work
for
ages
and
are
still
at
work
it
is
principally
in
the
south
seas
that
their
labors
are
carried
on
near
the
maldive
islands
they
have
formed
a
mass
whose
volume
is
equal
to
the
alps
around
new
caledonia
they
have
built
a
barrier
of
reefs
four
hundred
miles
in
length
and
another
along
the
northeast
coast
of
australia
a
thousand
miles
in
length
in
the
pacific
ocean
islands
reefs
and
islets
innumerable
have
been
constructed
by
them
which
extend
for
an
immense
distance
the
coral
islands
are
called
they
are
nearly
always
circular
with
a
depression
in
the
centre
they
are
originally
made
but
the
action
of
the
ocean
serves
to
throw
fragments
of
rock
into
the
inner
depression
which
thus
fills
up
firm
land
appears
the
rock
crumbles
into
soil
the
winds
and
birds
and
currents
bring
seeds
here
and
soon
the
new
island
is
covered
with
verdure
these
little
creatures
have
played
a
part
in
the
past
quite
as
important
as
in
the
present
all
germany
rests
upon
a
bank
of
coral
and
they
seem
to
have
been
most
active
during
the
oolitic
period
how
do
the
creatures
act
asked
featherstone
nobody
knows
replied
the
doctor
a
silence
now
followed
which
was
at
last
broken
by
oxenden
after
all
said
he
these
monsters
and
marvels
of
nature
form
the
least
interesting
feature
in
the
land
of
the
kosekin
to
me
the
people
themselves
are
the
chief
subject
of
interest
where
did
they
get
that
strange
love
of
death
which
is
as
strong
in
them
as
love
of
life
is
in
us
why
they
got
it
from
the
imagination
of
the
writer
of
the
manuscript
interrupted
melick
yes
it
easy
to
answer
it
from
your
point
of
view
yet
from
my
point
of
view
it
is
more
difficult
i
sometimes
think
that
it
may
be
the
strong
spirituality
of
the
semitic
race
carried
out
under
exceptionally
favorable
circumstances
to
the
ultimate
results
for
the
semitic
race
more
than
all
others
thought
little
of
this
life
and
turned
their
affections
to
the
life
that
lives
beyond
this
the
kosekin
may
thus
have
had
a
spiritual
development
of
their
own
which
ended
in
this
yet
there
may
be
another
reason
for
it
and
i
sometimes
think
that
the
kosekin
may
be
nearer
to
the
truth
than
we
are
we
have
by
nature
a
strong
love
of
life
it
is
our
dominant
feeling
but
yet
there
is
in
the
minds
of
all
men
a
deep
underlying
conviction
of
the
vanity
of
life
and
the
worthlessness
in
all
ages
and
among
all
races
the
best
the
purest
and
the
wisest
have
taught
this
truth
that
human
life
is
not
a
blessing
that
the
evil
predominates
over
the
good
and
that
our
best
hope
is
to
gain
a
spirit
of
acquiescence
with
its
inevitable
ills
all
philosophy
and
all
religions
teach
us
this
one
solemn
truth
that
in
this
life
the
evil
surpasses
the
good
it
has
always
been
so
suffering
has
been
the
lot
of
all
living
things
from
the
giant
of
the
primeval
swamps
down
to
the
smallest
zoophyte
it
is
far
more
so
with
man
some
favored
classes
in
every
age
may
furnish
forth
a
few
individuals
who
may
perhaps
lead
lives
of
and
luxury
but
to
the
mass
of
mankind
life
has
ever
been
and
must
ever
be
a
prolonged
scene
of
labor
intermingled
with
suffering
the
great
indian
religions
whether
brahmanic
or
buddhistic
teach
as
their
cardinal
doctrine
that
life
is
an
evil
buddhism
is
more
pronounced
in
this
for
it
teaches
more
emphatically
than
even
the
kosekin
that
the
chief
end
of
man
is
to
get
rid
of
the
curse
of
life
and
gain
the
bliss
of
nirvana
or
annihilation
true
it
does
not
take
so
practical
a
form
as
among
the
kosekin
yet
it
is
believed
by
of
the
human
race
as
the
foundation
of
the
religion
in
which
they
live
and
die
we
need
not
go
to
the
kosekin
however
for
such
maxims
as
these
the
intelligent
hindoos
the
chinese
the
japanese
with
many
other
nations
all
cling
firmly
to
this
belief
sakyamoum
gautama
buddha
the
son
and
heir
of
a
mighty
monarch
penetrated
with
the
conviction
of
the
misery
of
life
left
his
throne
embraced
a
life
of
voluntary
poverty
want
and
misery
so
that
he
might
find
his
way
to
a
better
state
the
end
before
him
being
this
that
he
might
ultimately
escape
from
the
curse
of
existence
he
lived
till
old
age
gained
innumerable
followers
and
left
to
them
as
a
solemn
legacy
the
maxim
that
not
to
exist
is
better
than
to
exist
that
death
is
better
than
life
since
his
day
millions
of
his
followers
have
upheld
his
principles
and
lived
his
life
even
among
the
joyous
greeks
we
find
this
feeling
at
times
bursting
forth
it
comes
when
we
least
expect
it
and
not
even
a
kosekin
poet
could
express
this
view
more
forcibly
than
sophocles
in
the
oedipus
at
colonus
to
be
born
surpasses
every
lot
and
the
next
best
lot
by
far
when
one
is
born
is
to
go
back
whence
he
came
as
soon
as
possible
for
while
youth
is
present
bringing
vain
follies
what
woes
does
it
not
have
what
ills
does
it
not
bear
murders
factions
strife
war
envy
but
the
extreme
of
misery
is
attained
by
loathsome
old
age
old
age
strengthless
unsociable
friendless
where
all
evils
upon
evils
dwell
together
i
give
you
the
words
of
a
later
poet
said
melick
who
takes
a
different
view
of
the
case
i
think
i
sing
them
with
your
permission
melick
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
sang
the
following
may
rail
at
this
life
from
the
hour
i
began
it
i
found
it
a
life
full
of
kindness
and
bliss
and
until
they
can
show
me
some
happier
planet
more
social
and
bright
i
content
me
with
this
as
long
as
the
world
has
such
lips
and
such
eyes
as
before
me
this
moment
enraptured
i
see
they
may
say
what
they
will
of
their
orbs
in
the
skies
but
this
earth
is
the
planet
for
you
love
and
me
what
a
pity
it
is
continued
melick
that
the
writer
of
this
manuscript
had
not
the
philological
theological
sociological
geological
palaeological
ontological
ornithological
and
all
the
other
logical
attainments
of
yourself
and
the
doctor
he
could
then
have
given
us
a
complete
view
of
the
nature
of
the
kosekin
morally
and
physically
he
could
have
treated
of
the
geology
of
the
soil
the
ethnology
of
the
people
and
could
have
unfolded
before
us
a
full
and
comprehensive
view
of
their
philosophy
and
religion
and
could
have
crammed
his
manuscript
with
statistics
i
wonder
why
he
did
do
it
even
as
it
was
it
must
have
been
a
strong
temptation
more
said
oxenden
with
deep
impressiveness
was
a
though
somewhat
emotional
sailor
and
merely
wrote
in
the
hope
that
his
story
might
one
day
meet
the
eyes
of
his
father
i
certainly
should
like
to
find
some
more
accurate
statements
about
the
science
philosophy
and
religion
of
the
kosekin
yet
after
all
such
things
could
not
be
expected
why
not
said
melick
it
was
easy
enough
for
him
how
asked
oxenden
why
he
had
only
to
step
into
the
british
museum
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
could
have
crammed
up
on
all
those
points
in
science
philosophy
ethnology
and
theology
about
which
you
are
so
anxious
to
know
well
said
featherstone
suppose
we
continue
our
reading
i
believe
it
is
my
turn
now
i
be
able
to
hold
out
so
long
as
you
did
oxenden
but
i
do
what
i
can
saying
this
featherstone
took
the
manuscript
and
went
on
to
read
chapter
xxviii
in
prison
it
was
with
hearts
full
of
the
gloomiest
forebodings
that
we
returned
to
the
amir
and
these
we
soon
found
to
be
fully
justified
the
athalebs
descended
at
that
point
from
which
they
had
risen
namely
on
the
terrace
immediately
in
front
of
the
cavern
where
they
had
been
confined
we
then
dismounted
and
layelah
with
the
kosekin
guards
accompanied
us
to
our
former
chambers
there
she
left
us
saying
that
a
communication
would
be
sent
to
us
we
were
now
left
to
our
own
conjectures
i
wonder
what
they
will
do
to
us
said
i
it
is
impossible
to
tell
said
almah
i
suppose
said
i
they
will
punish
us
in
some
way
but
then
punishment
among
the
kosekin
is
what
seems
honor
and
reward
to
me
perhaps
they
will
spare
our
lives
for
that
in
their
eyes
ought
to
be
the
severest
punishment
and
the
deepest
disgrace
imaginable
almah
sighed
the
kosekin
do
not
always
act
in
this
matter
as
one
would
suppose
said
she
it
is
quite
likely
that
they
may
dread
our
escaping
and
may
conclude
to
sacrifice
us
at
once
on
the
next
jom
i
had
a
visit
from
the
kohen
gadol
he
informed
me
that
the
paupers
had
held
a
council
of
state
in
which
they
had
made
a
special
examination
of
our
late
flight
he
and
layelah
had
both
been
examined
as
well
as
the
kosekin
who
had
gone
after
us
but
testimony
was
by
far
the
most
important
the
council
of
state
gathered
from
layelah
report
that
we
had
fled
to
magones
for
the
especial
purpose
of
gaining
the
most
blessed
of
deaths
that
she
pursued
us
in
the
interest
of
the
state
and
that
we
on
her
arrival
had
generously
surrendered
our
own
selfish
desires
and
had
at
once
returned
we
learned
that
much
gratification
was
felt
by
the
council
and
also
expressed
at
layelah
account
and
at
our
action
first
at
our
eager
love
of
death
which
was
so
natural
in
their
eyes
secondly
at
the
skill
which
we
had
shown
in
selecting
magones
and
finally
at
our
generosity
in
giving
up
so
readily
the
blessed
prospect
of
exile
and
want
and
death
so
as
to
come
back
to
the
amir
had
we
been
kosekin
our
acts
would
have
been
natural
enough
but
being
foreigners
it
was
considered
more
admirable
in
us
and
it
seemed
to
show
that
we
were
equal
to
the
kosekin
themselves
it
was
felt
however
that
in
our
eager
rush
after
death
we
had
been
somewhat
selfish
but
as
this
probably
arose
from
our
ignorance
of
the
law
it
might
be
overlooked
on
the
whole
it
was
decided
that
we
ought
to
be
rewarded
and
that
too
with
the
greatest
benefits
that
the
kosekin
could
bestow
what
these
benefits
were
the
kohen
gadol
could
not
say
and
thus
we
were
left
as
before
in
the
greatest
possible
anxiety
we
still
dreaded
the
worst
the
highest
honors
of
these
men
might
well
awaken
apprehension
for
they
thought
that
the
chief
blessings
were
poverty
and
darkness
and
death
layelah
next
came
to
see
me
she
was
as
amiable
as
ever
and
showed
no
resentment
at
all
she
gave
me
an
account
of
what
had
happened
at
the
council
of
state
which
was
the
same
as
what
i
had
heard
from
the
kohen
gadol
i
asked
her
why
she
had
made
such
a
report
of
us
to
conciliate
their
said
layelah
for
if
they
thought
that
you
had
really
fled
from
death
from
a
love
of
life
they
would
have
felt
such
contempt
for
you
that
serious
harm
might
have
happened
yes
said
i
but
among
the
kosekin
what
you
call
harm
would
probably
have
been
just
what
i
want
i
should
like
to
be
viewed
with
contempt
and
considered
unworthy
of
death
and
the
mista
kosek
and
other
such
honors
oh
yes
said
layelah
but
that
does
follow
for
you
see
the
paupers
love
death
so
intensely
that
they
long
to
bestow
it
on
all
and
if
they
knew
that
you
were
afraid
of
it
they
would
be
tempted
to
bestow
it
upon
you
immediately
just
to
show
you
how
delightful
a
thing
it
is
and
that
was
the
very
thing
that
i
was
trying
to
guard
against
well
said
i
and
what
is
the
result
do
you
know
what
their
decision
is
yes
said
layelah
what
is
it
i
asked
eagerly
layelah
hesitated
what
is
it
i
cried
again
full
of
impatience
i
afraid
it
will
not
sound
very
pleasant
to
you
said
layelah
but
at
any
rate
your
life
is
spared
for
the
present
they
have
decided
to
give
you
what
they
call
the
greatest
possible
honors
and
distinctions
layelah
paused
and
looked
at
me
earnestly
for
my
part
these
words
sounded
ominous
and
were
full
of
the
darkest
meaning
tell
me
all
i
said
do
keep
me
in
suspense
well
said
layelah
i
afraid
you
will
think
it
hard
but
i
must
tell
you
i
will
tell
it
therefore
as
briefly
and
formally
as
possible
first
then
they
have
decreed
the
blessing
of
separation
you
and
almah
must
now
be
parted
since
this
is
regarded
as
the
highest
bliss
of
lovers
secondly
they
have
decreed
the
blessing
of
poverty
all
these
luxuries
will
be
taken
away
and
you
will
be
raised
to
an
equality
in
this
respect
with
the
great
paupers
thirdly
you
are
to
have
the
blessing
of
darkness
you
are
to
be
removed
from
this
troublesome
and
vexatious
light
which
here
is
regarded
as
a
curse
and
henceforth
live
without
it
fourthly
the
next
decree
is
the
high
reward
of
imprisonment
you
are
to
be
delivered
from
the
evils
of
liberty
and
shut
up
in
a
dark
cavern
from
which
it
will
be
impossible
to
escape
or
to
communicate
with
anyone
outside
fifthly
you
are
to
associate
with
the
greatest
of
the
paupers
the
class
that
is
the
most
honored
and
influential
you
will
be
present
at
all
their
highest
councils
and
will
have
the
privilege
of
perpetual
intercourse
with
those
reverend
men
they
will
tell
you
of
the
joys
of
poverty
the
happiness
of
darkness
and
the
bliss
of
death
layelah
paused
and
looked
at
me
earnestly
is
there
anything
more
i
gasped
no
said
she
is
not
that
enough
some
were
in
favor
of
bestowing
immediate
death
but
they
were
outvoted
by
the
others
you
surely
can
not
regret
that
layelah
words
sounded
like
the
words
of
a
mocking
demon
yet
she
did
not
wish
to
distress
me
she
had
merely
stated
my
sentence
in
formal
language
without
any
attempt
to
soften
its
tremendous
import
as
for
me
i
was
overwhelmed
with
despair
there
was
but
one
thought
in
my
mind
it
was
not
of
myself
but
of
almah
and
almah
i
cried
almah
said
layelah
she
will
have
the
same
you
are
both
included
in
the
same
sentence
at
this
a
groan
burst
from
me
horror
overwhelmed
me
i
threw
myself
down
upon
the
floor
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
all
was
lost
our
fate
almah
fate
was
darkness
imprisonment
and
death
could
anything
be
imagined
that
might
mitigate
such
woes
as
these
could
anything
be
conceived
of
as
more
horrible
yes
there
remained
something
more
and
this
was
announced
by
layelah
finally
said
she
it
has
been
decreed
that
you
shall
not
only
have
the
blessing
of
death
but
that
you
shall
have
the
rare
honor
of
belonging
to
the
chosen
few
who
are
reserved
for
the
mista
kosek
thus
far
this
had
not
been
granted
it
was
esteemed
too
high
an
honor
for
strangers
but
now
by
an
exercise
of
unparalleled
liberality
the
grand
council
of
paupers
have
added
this
as
the
last
and
best
to
the
high
honors
and
rewards
which
they
have
decreed
for
you
and
almah
to
this
i
had
nothing
to
say
i
was
stupefied
with
horror
to
such
words
what
answer
could
be
made
at
that
moment
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
this
tremendous
sentence
this
infliction
of
appalling
woes
under
the
miserable
name
of
blessings
i
could
not
think
of
layelah
nor
did
i
try
to
conjecture
what
her
motives
might
be
in
thus
coming
to
me
as
the
messenger
of
evil
i
could
not
find
space
amid
my
despair
for
speculations
as
to
her
own
part
in
this
or
stop
to
consider
whether
she
was
acting
the
part
of
a
mere
messenger
or
was
influenced
by
resentment
or
revenge
all
this
was
far
away
from
my
thoughts
for
all
my
mind
was
filled
with
the
dread
sentence
of
the
council
of
paupers
and
the
baleful
prospect
of
the
woes
that
awaited
us
on
the
next
jom
i
saw
almah
she
had
already
learned
the
awful
tidings
she
met
me
with
a
face
of
despair
for
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
and
all
that
remained
for
us
was
a
last
farewell
after
this
we
parted
and
each
of
us
was
taken
to
our
respective
prison
i
was
taken
along
dark
passages
until
i
came
to
a
cavern
with
a
low
dark
portal
upon
entering
i
found
the
darkness
deeper
than
usual
and
there
was
only
one
solitary
lamp
which
diffused
but
a
feeble
ray
through
the
gloom
the
size
of
the
place
could
not
be
made
out
i
saw
here
a
group
of
human
beings
and
by
the
feeble
ray
of
the
lamp
i
perceived
that
they
were
wan
and
thin
and
emaciated
with
scant
clothing
all
in
rags
squalor
misery
and
dirt
with
coarse
hair
matted
together
and
long
nails
and
shaggy
beards
they
reminded
me
in
their
personal
appearance
of
the
cannibals
of
the
outer
shore
these
hideous
beings
all
gathered
around
me
blinking
at
me
with
their
bleary
eyes
and
grinning
with
their
abominable
faces
and
then
each
one
embraced
me
the
filth
squalor
and
unutterable
foulness
of
these
wretches
all
combined
to
fill
my
soul
with
loathing
and
the
inconceivable
horror
of
that
embrace
wellnigh
overwhelmed
me
yet
after
all
it
was
surpassed
by
the
horror
of
the
thought
that
almah
might
be
at
that
very
moment
undergoing
the
same
experience
and
for
her
such
a
thing
must
be
worse
than
for
me
i
retreated
as
far
as
possible
from
them
deep
into
the
thick
darkness
and
sat
down
no
convicted
felon
at
the
last
hour
of
life
no
prisoner
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
ever
could
have
suffered
more
mental
agony
than
i
did
at
that
moment
the
blessings
the
awful
blessings
of
the
kosekin
were
descending
upon
my
miserable
head
separation
from
almah
squalor
and
dirt
imprisonment
the
society
of
these
filthy
creatures
darkness
the
shadow
of
death
and
beyond
all
the
tremendous
horrors
of
the
mista
kosek
i
do
not
know
how
the
time
passed
for
at
first
i
was
almost
stupefied
with
despair
nor
could
i
ever
grow
reconciled
to
the
society
of
these
wretches
scarce
human
who
were
with
me
some
food
was
offered
me
filthy
stuff
which
i
refused
my
refusal
excited
warm
commendation
but
i
was
warned
against
starving
myself
as
that
was
against
the
law
in
my
despair
i
thought
of
my
pistol
and
rifle
which
i
still
kept
with
me
of
using
these
against
my
jailors
and
bursting
forth
but
this
wild
impulse
soon
passed
away
for
its
utter
hopelessness
was
manifest
my
only
hope
if
hope
it
was
lay
in
waiting
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
i
might
see
almah
again
if
only
once
joms
passed
away
i
know
not
how
the
chief
pauper
who
is
the
greatest
man
in
the
land
of
the
kosekin
made
several
attempts
to
converse
with
me
and
was
evidently
very
condescending
and
magnanimous
in
his
own
eyes
but
i
did
not
meet
his
advances
graciously
he
was
too
abhorrent
he
was
a
hideous
wretch
with
eyes
nearly
closed
and
bleary
thick
matted
hair
and
fiendish
expression
in
short
a
devil
incarnate
in
rags
and
squalor
but
as
the
joms
passed
i
found
it
difficult
to
repel
my
associates
they
were
always
inflicting
their
society
upon
me
and
thrusting
on
me
nasty
little
acts
of
kindness
the
chief
pauper
was
more
persistent
than
all
with
his
chatter
and
his
disgusting
civilities
he
was
evidently
glad
to
get
hold
of
a
fresh
subject
for
his
talkative
genius
he
was
a
very
garrulous
cannibal
and
perhaps
my
being
a
foreigner
made
me
more
interesting
in
his
eyes
the
chief
topic
of
his
discourse
was
death
he
hated
life
loved
death
longed
for
it
in
all
its
forms
whether
arising
from
disease
or
from
violence
he
was
an
amateur
in
corpses
and
had
a
larger
experience
in
dead
bodies
than
any
other
man
in
the
nation
i
could
not
help
asking
him
once
why
he
did
not
kill
himself
and
be
done
with
it
that
said
he
is
not
allowed
the
temptation
to
kill
one
self
is
one
of
the
strongest
that
human
nature
can
experience
but
it
is
one
that
we
must
struggle
against
of
course
for
it
is
against
all
law
the
greatest
blessing
must
not
be
seized
it
must
be
given
by
nature
or
man
those
who
violate
the
blessed
mystery
of
death
are
infamous
he
assured
me
that
he
had
all
his
life
cultivated
the
loftiest
feelings
of
love
to
others
his
greatest
happiness
consisted
in
doing
good
to
others
especially
in
killing
them
the
blessing
of
death
being
the
greatest
of
all
blessings
was
the
one
which
he
loved
best
to
bestow
upon
others
and
the
more
he
loved
his
the
more
he
wished
to
give
them
this
blessing
you
said
he
are
particularly
dear
to
me
and
i
should
rather
give
to
you
the
blessing
of
death
than
to
any
other
human
being
i
love
you
and
i
long
to
kill
you
at
this
moment
you
had
better
not
try
it
said
i
grimly
he
shook
his
head
despondingly
oh
no
said
he
it
is
against
the
law
i
must
not
do
it
till
the
time
comes
do
you
kill
many
i
asked
it
is
my
pleasing
and
glorious
office
he
replied
to
kill
more
than
any
other
for
you
must
know
i
am
the
sar
tabakin
chief
of
the
executioners
the
chief
pauper
love
of
death
had
grown
to
be
an
passion
he
longed
to
give
death
to
all
as
with
us
there
are
certain
philanthropists
who
have
a
mania
for
doing
good
so
here
the
pauper
class
had
a
mania
for
doing
what
they
considered
good
in
this
way
the
chief
pauper
was
a
sort
of
kosekin
howard
or
peabody
and
was
regarded
by
all
with
boundless
reverence
to
me
however
he
was
an
object
of
hate
abhorrence
and
loathing
and
added
to
this
was
the
thought
that
there
might
be
here
some
equally
hideous
female
someone
like
the
nightmare
hag
of
the
outer
sea
a
torment
and
a
horror
to
almah
chapter
xxix
the
ceremony
of
separation
separated
from
almah
surrounded
by
foul
fiends
in
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
with
the
baleful
prospect
of
the
mista
kosek
it
was
mine
to
endure
the
bitterest
anguish
and
despair
and
in
me
these
feelings
were
all
the
worse
from
the
thought
that
almah
was
in
a
similar
state
and
was
enduring
equal
woes
all
that
i
suffered
in
my
present
condition
she
too
was
suffering
and
from
this
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
perhaps
her
surroundings
were
even
worse
and
her
sufferings
keener
for
who
could
tell
what
these
people
might
inflict
in
their
strange
and
perverted
impulses
many
joms
passed
and
there
was
only
one
thing
that
sustained
me
the
hope
of
seeing
almah
yet
again
though
it
were
but
for
a
moment
that
hope
however
was
but
faint
there
was
no
escape
the
gate
was
barred
without
and
within
i
was
surrounded
by
miscreants
who
formed
the
chief
class
in
the
state
and
the
ruling
order
the
chief
pauper
was
the
highest
magistrate
in
the
land
from
whose
opinion
there
was
no
appeal
and
the
other
paupers
here
formed
the
kosekin
senate
here
in
imprisonment
and
darkness
they
formed
a
secret
tribunal
and
controlled
everything
they
were
objects
of
envy
to
all
all
looked
forward
to
this
position
as
the
highest
object
of
human
ambition
and
the
friends
and
relatives
of
those
here
rejoiced
in
their
honor
their
powers
were
not
executive
but
deliberative
to
the
meleks
and
athons
was
left
the
exercise
of
authority
but
their
acts
were
always
in
subordination
to
the
will
of
the
paupers
i
have
everything
that
heart
can
wish
said
the
chief
pauper
to
me
once
look
at
me
and
see
me
as
i
stand
here
i
have
poverty
squalor
cold
perpetual
darkness
the
privilege
of
killing
others
the
near
prospect
of
death
and
the
certainty
of
the
mista
kosek
all
these
i
have
and
yet
after
all
i
am
not
happy
to
this
strange
speech
i
had
nothing
to
say
yes
continued
the
chief
pauper
in
a
pensive
tone
for
twenty
seasons
i
have
reigned
as
chief
of
the
kosekin
in
this
place
my
cavern
is
the
coldest
squalidest
and
darkest
in
the
land
my
raiment
is
the
coarsest
rags
i
have
separated
from
all
my
friends
i
have
had
much
sickness
i
have
the
closest
captivity
death
darkness
poverty
want
all
that
men
most
live
and
long
for
are
mine
to
satiety
and
yet
as
i
look
back
and
count
the
joms
of
my
life
to
see
in
how
many
i
have
known
happiness
i
find
that
in
all
they
amount
to
just
seven
oh
what
a
comment
is
this
on
the
vanity
of
human
life
to
this
i
had
no
answer
ready
but
by
way
of
saying
something
i
offered
to
kill
him
on
the
spot
nay
nay
said
he
with
a
melancholy
smile
do
not
tempt
me
leave
me
to
struggle
with
temptations
by
myself
and
do
not
seek
to
make
me
falter
in
my
duty
yes
you
behold
in
me
a
melancholy
example
of
the
folly
of
ambition
for
i
often
think
as
i
look
down
from
my
lofty
eminence
that
after
all
it
is
as
well
to
remain
content
in
the
humble
sphere
in
which
we
are
placed
at
birth
for
perhaps
if
the
truth
were
known
there
is
quite
as
much
real
happiness
among
the
rich
and
splendid
among
the
athons
and
meleks
on
this
occasion
i
took
advantage
of
the
chief
pauper
softer
mood
to
pour
forth
an
earnest
entreaty
for
him
to
save
almah
life
or
at
least
to
mitigate
her
miseries
alas
he
was
inexorable
it
was
like
an
appeal
of
some
mad
prisoner
to
some
governor
in
christendom
entreating
him
to
put
some
to
death
or
at
least
to
make
his
confinement
more
severe
the
chief
pauper
stared
at
me
in
horror
you
are
a
strange
being
said
he
gently
sometimes
i
think
you
mad
i
can
only
say
that
such
a
request
is
horrible
to
me
beyond
all
words
such
degradation
and
cruelty
to
the
gentle
and
virtuous
almah
is
outrageous
and
forever
impossible
no
we
will
not
deprive
her
of
a
single
one
of
those
blessings
which
she
now
enjoys
i
turned
away
in
despair
at
length
one
jom
the
chief
pauper
came
to
me
with
a
smile
and
said
let
me
congratulate
you
on
this
joyous
occasion
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
you
are
to
have
your
ceremony
of
separation
separation
i
repeated
yes
said
he
almah
has
given
notice
to
us
she
has
announced
her
intention
of
giving
you
up
and
separating
from
you
with
us
the
woman
always
gives
the
announcement
in
such
cases
we
have
fixed
the
ceremony
for
the
third
jom
from
this
and
i
hope
you
will
not
think
it
too
soon
this
strange
intelligence
moved
me
greatly
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
a
ceremony
of
separation
but
behind
this
there
rose
the
prospect
of
seeing
almah
and
i
felt
convinced
that
she
had
devised
this
as
a
mode
of
holding
communication
with
me
or
at
least
of
seeing
me
again
the
thought
of
layelah
was
the
only
thing
that
interfered
with
this
belief
for
it
might
be
her
doings
after
all
yet
the
fact
remained
that
i
was
to
see
almah
and
in
this
i
rejoiced
with
exceeding
great
joy
the
appointed
jom
came
a
procession
was
formed
of
the
paupers
the
chief
did
not
go
as
he
never
left
the
cavern
except
on
the
great
sacrifices
and
mista
koseks
the
door
was
opened
and
i
accompanied
the
procession
on
our
way
all
was
dark
and
after
traversing
many
passages
we
came
at
length
to
the
door
of
a
cavern
as
gloomy
as
the
one
i
had
left
on
entering
this
i
found
all
dark
and
drear
and
a
little
distance
before
me
there
was
a
light
burning
around
which
was
gathered
a
group
of
hags
hideous
beyond
all
expression
but
these
i
scarcely
noticed
for
there
amid
them
all
pale
and
wan
with
her
face
now
lighted
up
with
joyous
and
eager
expectation
i
saw
my
darling
my
almah
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
for
a
few
moments
neither
of
us
spoke
a
word
she
sobbed
upon
my
breast
but
i
knew
that
the
tears
which
she
shed
were
tears
of
joy
nor
was
our
joy
checked
by
the
thought
that
it
was
to
be
so
it
was
enough
at
that
moment
that
we
saw
one
another
enough
that
we
were
in
one
another
arms
and
so
we
mingled
our
tears
and
shared
one
common
rapture
and
sweet
it
was
sweet
beyond
all
expression
the
sweetest
moment
in
all
my
life
for
it
had
come
in
the
midst
of
the
drear
desolation
of
my
heart
and
the
black
despair
it
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
intense
darkness
short
and
sudden
indeed
yet
still
intense
while
it
lasted
and
in
an
instant
filling
all
with
its
glow
i
did
this
murmured
almah
to
see
you
and
to
save
you
save
me
i
repeated
yes
said
she
i
have
seen
layelah
she
told
me
that
there
is
this
chance
and
this
one
only
to
save
you
i
determined
to
try
it
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
you
at
the
sacrifice
and
for
love
of
me
meeting
your
death
for
i
would
die
to
save
you
i
pressed
her
closer
in
my
arms
oh
almah
said
i
i
would
die
to
save
you
and
if
this
ceremony
will
save
you
i
will
go
through
with
it
and
accept
my
fate
whatever
it
may
be
we
were
now
interrupted
the
women
the
hags
of
horror
the
ones
as
i
may
call
them
or
the
the
female
fiends
the
foul
ones
they
were
all
around
us
and
one
there
was
who
looked
so
exactly
like
the
nightmare
hag
of
the
outer
sea
that
i
felt
sure
she
must
be
the
same
who
by
some
strange
chance
had
come
here
such
indeed
is
quite
likely
for
there
may
have
been
a
pass
over
the
mountains
to
the
land
of
the
kosekin
and
those
savage
cannibals
may
all
have
been
honored
kosekin
exiles
dwelling
in
poverty
want
woe
and
darkness
all
of
which
may
have
been
allotted
to
them
as
a
reward
for
eminent
virtues
and
so
here
she
was
the
nightmare
hag
and
i
saw
that
she
recognized
me
a
circle
was
now
formed
around
us
and
the
light
stood
in
the
middle
the
nightmare
hag
also
stood
within
the
circle
on
the
other
side
of
the
light
opposite
us
the
beams
of
the
lamp
flickered
through
the
darkness
faintly
illuminating
the
faces
of
the
horrible
creatures
around
who
foul
and
repulsive
as
harpies
seemed
like
unclean
beasts
ready
to
make
us
their
prey
their
glances
seemed
to
menace
death
their
blear
eyes
rested
upon
us
with
a
horrid
eager
hunger
my
worst
fears
at
that
moment
seemed
realized
for
i
saw
that
associates
were
worse
than
mine
and
her
fate
had
been
more
bitter
and
i
wondered
how
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
live
among
such
associates
or
even
though
she
had
lived
thus
far
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
endure
it
longer
and
now
there
arose
a
melancholy
chant
from
the
old
hags
around
a
dreadful
strain
that
sounded
like
a
funeral
dirge
sung
in
shrill
discordant
voices
led
by
the
nightmare
hag
who
as
she
sang
waved
in
her
hand
a
kind
of
club
all
the
time
i
held
almah
in
my
arms
regardless
of
those
around
us
thinking
only
of
her
from
whom
i
must
soon
again
be
separated
and
whom
i
must
leave
in
this
drear
abode
to
meet
her
fearful
fate
alone
the
chant
continued
for
some
time
and
as
long
as
it
continued
it
was
sweet
to
me
for
it
prolonged
the
meeting
with
almah
and
postponed
by
so
much
our
separation
at
length
the
chant
ceased
the
nightmare
hag
looked
fixedly
at
us
and
spoke
these
words
you
have
embraced
for
the
last
time
henceforth
there
is
no
more
sorrow
in
your
love
you
may
be
happy
now
in
being
forever
disunited
and
in
knowing
the
bliss
of
eternal
separation
as
darkness
is
better
than
light
as
death
is
better
than
life
so
may
you
find
separation
better
than
union
she
now
gave
a
blow
with
her
club
at
the
lamp
which
broke
it
to
atoms
and
extinguished
the
flame
she
continued
as
the
baleful
light
is
succeeded
by
the
blessed
darkness
so
may
you
find
the
light
of
union
followed
by
the
blessed
darkness
of
separation
and
now
in
the
deep
darkness
we
stood
clasped
in
one
another
arms
while
around
us
from
the
horrible
circle
of
hags
there
arose
another
chant
as
harsh
and
discordant
as
the
previous
one
but
which
nevertheless
like
that
served
at
least
to
keep
us
together
a
little
longer
for
this
reason
it
sounded
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
music
and
therefore
when
at
last
the
hideous
noise
ended
i
felt
a
pang
of
grief
for
i
knew
that
i
must
now
give
up
almah
forever
i
was
right
the
ceremony
was
over
we
had
to
part
and
we
parted
with
tears
of
despair
i
was
led
away
and
as
i
went
i
heard
almah
sobs
i
broke
away
and
tried
to
return
for
one
more
embrace
but
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
find
her
and
could
only
hear
her
sobs
at
a
greater
distance
which
showed
that
she
too
was
being
led
away
i
called
after
her
farewell
almah
her
reply
came
back
broken
with
sobs
farewell
forever
i
was
once
more
led
away
and
again
traversed
the
dark
passages
and
again
came
back
to
my
den
which
now
seemed
dark
with
the
blackness
of
despair
on
my
return
i
was
formally
and
solemnly
congratulated
by
all
the
paupers
i
should
not
have
received
their
congratulations
had
i
not
expected
that
there
would
be
something
more
i
expected
that
something
would
be
said
about
the
result
of
this
act
of
separation
for
almah
had
believed
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
saving
my
life
and
i
believed
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
saving
her
life
and
for
this
reason
each
of
us
had
performed
our
part
although
of
course
the
joy
of
meeting
with
one
another
would
of
itself
have
been
sufficient
and
more
than
sufficient
to
make
that
ceremony
an
object
of
desire
i
thought
therefore
that
some
statement
might
now
be
made
to
the
effect
that
by
means
of
this
ceremony
my
status
among
the
kosekin
would
be
changed
and
that
both
i
and
almah
being
no
longer
lovers
would
be
no
longer
fit
for
the
sacrifice
to
my
intense
disappointment
however
nothing
whatever
was
said
that
had
the
remotest
reference
to
this
on
the
following
jom
i
determined
to
ask
the
chief
pauper
himself
directly
and
accordingly
after
a
brief
preamble
i
put
the
question
will
our
ceremony
of
separation
make
any
difference
as
to
our
sacrifice
what
he
asked
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
repeated
the
question
i
do
understand
said
he
still
looking
puzzled
upon
this
i
once
more
repeated
it
how
can
that
be
said
he
at
length
how
can
the
ceremony
of
separation
have
any
effect
upon
your
sacrifice
the
ceremony
of
separation
stands
by
itself
as
the
sign
and
symbol
of
an
additional
blessing
this
new
happiness
of
separation
is
a
great
favor
and
will
make
you
the
object
of
new
envy
and
admiration
for
few
have
been
so
fortunate
as
you
in
all
the
history
of
the
kosekin
but
you
are
the
favorite
of
the
kosekin
now
and
there
is
nothing
that
they
will
not
do
for
you
but
we
were
separate
before
said
i
indignantly
that
is
true
said
he
in
point
of
fact
but
this
ceremony
makes
your
separation
a
legal
thing
and
gives
it
the
solemn
sanction
of
law
and
of
religion
among
the
kosekin
one
can
not
be
considered
as
a
separate
man
until
the
ceremony
of
separation
has
been
publicly
performed
i
understood
said
i
that
we
were
chosen
to
suffer
the
sacrifice
together
because
we
were
lovers
and
now
since
you
do
not
any
longer
regard
us
as
lovers
why
do
you
sacrifice
us
at
this
question
the
chief
pauper
looked
at
me
with
one
of
those
hungry
glances
of
his
which
showed
how
he
thirsted
for
my
blood
and
he
smiled
the
smile
of
an
evil
fiend
why
do
we
sacrifice
you
he
replied
why
because
we
honor
you
both
and
love
you
both
so
dearly
that
we
are
eager
to
give
you
the
greatest
of
all
blessings
and
to
deny
you
nothing
that
is
in
our
power
to
bestow
do
you
mean
to
sacrifice
both
of
us
i
gasped
of
course
what
almah
too
certainly
why
should
we
be
so
cruel
to
the
dear
child
as
to
deprive
her
of
so
great
a
boon
at
this
i
groaned
aloud
and
turned
away
in
despair
many
joms
now
passed
away
i
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
and
desperate
i
thought
sometimes
of
fighting
my
way
out
my
were
now
my
chief
consolation
for
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
not
to
die
quietly
like
a
slaughtered
calf
but
to
strike
a
blow
for
life
and
meet
my
death
amid
slain
enemies
in
this
prospect
i
found
some
satisfaction
and
death
was
robbed
of
some
of
its
terrors
chapter
xxx
the
day
of
sacrifice
at
last
the
time
came
it
was
the
end
of
the
dark
season
then
as
the
sun
rises
for
its
permanent
course
around
the
heavens
when
the
long
day
of
six
months
begins
all
in
the
land
of
the
kosekin
is
sorrow
and
the
last
of
the
loved
darkness
is
mourned
over
amid
the
most
solemn
ceremonies
and
celebrated
with
the
most
imposing
sacrifices
then
the
most
honored
in
all
the
land
are
publicly
presented
with
the
blessing
of
death
and
allowed
to
depart
this
hated
life
and
go
to
the
realms
of
that
eternal
darkness
which
they
love
so
well
it
is
the
greatest
of
sacrifices
and
is
followed
by
the
greatest
of
feasts
thus
the
busy
season
the
loved
season
of
darkness
ends
and
the
long
hateful
season
of
light
begins
when
the
kosekin
lurk
in
caverns
and
live
in
this
way
in
the
presence
of
what
may
be
called
artificial
darkness
it
was
for
us
for
me
and
for
almah
the
day
of
doom
since
the
ceremony
of
separation
i
had
not
seen
her
but
my
heart
had
been
always
with
her
i
did
not
even
know
whether
she
was
alive
or
not
but
believed
that
she
must
be
for
i
thought
that
if
she
had
died
i
should
have
heard
of
it
as
the
kosekin
would
have
rejoiced
greatly
over
such
an
event
for
every
death
is
to
them
an
occasion
of
joy
and
the
death
of
one
so
distinguished
and
so
beloved
as
almah
would
have
given
rise
to
nothing
less
than
a
national
festival
of
time
i
had
but
a
poor
reckoning
but
from
the
way
in
which
the
paupers
kept
account
of
their
joms
i
judged
that
about
three
months
had
elapsed
since
the
ceremony
of
separation
the
paupers
were
now
all
joyous
with
a
hideous
joy
the
chief
pauper
was
more
abhorrent
than
ever
he
had
the
strong
upon
him
he
was
on
that
jom
to
perform
his
horrible
office
of
sar
tabakin
and
as
he
accosted
me
he
smiled
the
smile
of
a
demon
and
congratulated
me
on
my
coming
escape
from
life
to
this
i
had
no
word
of
answer
to
make
but
my
hands
held
my
rifle
and
pistol
and
these
i
clutched
with
a
firmer
grasp
as
my
last
hour
approached
the
time
of
departure
at
length
arrived
soldiers
of
the
kosekin
came
following
the
paupers
who
went
first
while
the
guards
came
after
me
thus
we
all
emerged
into
the
open
air
there
the
broad
terrace
already
mentioned
spread
out
before
my
eyes
filled
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
human
beings
it
seemed
as
though
the
entire
population
of
the
city
was
there
and
so
densely
packed
was
this
great
crowd
that
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
a
way
was
laid
open
for
our
passage
above
was
the
sky
where
the
stars
were
twinkling
faintly
there
was
no
longer
the
light
of
the
aurora
australis
the
constellations
glimmered
but
dimly
the
moon
was
shining
with
but
a
feeble
ray
for
there
far
away
over
the
icy
crests
of
the
lofty
mountains
i
saw
a
long
line
of
splendid
effulgence
all
golden
and
red
the
light
of
the
new
dawn
the
dawn
of
that
long
day
which
was
now
approaching
the
sight
of
that
dawning
light
gave
me
new
life
it
was
like
a
sight
of
home
the
blessed
dawn
the
sunlight
of
a
bright
day
the
glorious
daybreak
lost
for
so
long
a
time
but
now
at
last
returning
i
feasted
my
eyes
on
the
spectacle
i
burst
into
tears
of
joy
and
i
felt
as
though
i
could
gaze
at
it
forever
but
the
sun
as
it
travelled
was
rapidly
coming
into
view
soon
the
dazzling
glory
of
its
rim
would
appear
above
the
mountain
crest
and
the
season
of
darkness
would
end
there
was
no
time
to
wait
and
the
guards
hurried
me
on
there
in
the
midst
of
the
square
rose
the
pyramid
it
was
fully
a
hundred
feet
in
height
with
a
broad
flat
top
at
the
base
i
saw
a
great
crowd
of
paupers
through
these
we
passed
and
as
we
did
so
a
horrible
arose
we
now
went
up
the
steps
and
reached
the
top
it
was
about
sixty
feet
square
and
upon
it
there
was
a
quadrangle
of
stones
set
about
three
feet
apart
about
sixty
in
number
while
in
the
midst
was
a
larger
stone
all
of
these
were
evidently
intended
for
sacrificial
purposes
scarcely
had
i
reached
the
top
when
i
saw
a
procession
ascend
from
the
other
side
first
came
some
paupers
then
some
hags
and
then
followed
by
other
hags
i
saw
almah
i
was
transfixed
at
the
sight
a
thrill
passed
through
every
nerve
and
a
wild
impulse
came
to
me
to
burst
through
the
crowd
join
her
and
battle
with
them
all
for
her
life
but
the
crowd
was
too
dense
i
could
only
stand
and
look
at
her
and
mark
the
paleness
of
her
face
and
her
mute
despair
she
saw
me
waved
her
hand
sadly
and
gave
a
mournful
smile
there
we
stood
separated
by
the
crowd
with
our
eyes
fastened
on
each
other
and
all
our
hearts
filled
with
one
deep
intense
yearning
to
fly
to
one
another
side
and
now
there
came
up
from
below
louder
and
deeper
the
awful
time
was
pressing
the
preparations
were
made
the
chief
pauper
took
his
station
by
the
central
stone
and
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
long
keen
knife
toward
this
stone
i
was
led
the
chief
pauper
then
looked
with
his
blear
and
blinking
eyes
to
where
the
dawn
was
glowing
over
the
mountain
crest
and
every
moment
increasing
in
brightness
and
then
after
a
brief
survey
he
turned
and
whetted
his
knife
on
the
sacrificial
stone
after
this
he
turned
to
me
with
his
evil
face
with
the
glare
of
a
horrid
in
his
ravenous
eyes
and
pointed
to
the
stone
i
stood
without
motion
he
repeated
the
gesture
and
said
lie
down
here
i
will
not
said
i
but
it
is
on
this
stone
said
he
that
you
are
to
get
the
blessing
of
death
i
die
first
said
i
fiercely
and
i
raised
my
rifle
the
chief
pauper
was
puzzled
at
this
the
others
looked
on
quietly
thinking
it
probably
a
debate
about
some
punctilio
suddenly
he
seemed
struck
with
an
idea
yes
yes
said
he
the
woman
first
it
is
better
so
saying
this
he
walked
toward
almah
and
said
something
to
the
hags
at
this
the
chief
of
them
namely
the
nightmare
hag
led
almah
to
the
nearest
stone
and
motioned
to
her
to
lie
down
almah
prepared
to
obey
but
paused
a
moment
to
throw
at
me
one
last
glance
and
wave
her
hand
as
a
last
farewell
then
without
a
word
she
laid
herself
down
upon
the
stone
at
this
a
thrill
of
fury
rushed
through
all
my
being
rousing
me
from
my
stupor
impelling
me
to
action
filling
my
brain
with
madness
the
nightmare
hag
had
already
raised
her
long
keen
knife
in
the
air
another
moment
and
the
blow
would
have
fallen
but
my
rifle
was
at
my
shoulder
my
aim
was
deadly
the
report
rang
out
like
thunder
a
wild
piercing
yell
followed
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
nightmare
hag
lay
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
i
was
already
there
having
burst
through
the
astonished
crowd
and
almah
was
in
my
arms
and
holding
her
thus
for
a
moment
i
put
myself
in
front
of
her
and
stood
at
bay
with
my
only
thought
that
of
defending
her
to
the
last
and
selling
my
life
as
dearly
as
possible
the
result
was
amazing
after
the
report
there
was
for
some
moments
a
deep
silence
which
was
followed
by
a
wild
abrupt
outcry
from
half
a
million
people
the
roar
of
indistinguishable
words
bursting
forth
from
the
lips
of
all
that
throng
whose
accumulated
volume
arose
in
one
vast
of
sound
pealing
forth
echoing
along
the
terraced
streets
and
rolling
on
far
away
in
endless
reverberations
it
was
like
the
roar
of
mighty
cataracts
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
and
at
the
voice
of
that
vast
multitude
i
shrank
back
for
a
moment
as
i
did
so
i
looked
down
and
beheld
a
scene
as
appalling
as
the
sound
that
had
overawed
me
in
all
that
countless
throng
of
human
beings
there
was
not
one
who
was
not
in
motion
and
all
were
pressing
forward
toward
the
pyramid
as
to
a
common
centre
on
every
side
there
was
a
multitudinous
sea
of
upturned
faces
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
all
were
in
violent
agitation
as
though
all
were
possessed
by
one
common
impulse
which
forced
them
toward
me
at
such
a
sight
i
thought
of
nothing
else
than
that
i
was
the
object
of
their
wrath
and
that
they
were
all
with
one
common
fury
rushing
toward
me
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
me
and
upon
almah
for
the
slaughter
of
the
nightmare
hag
all
this
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
moments
and
now
as
i
stood
there
holding
almah
appalled
despairing
yet
resolute
and
calm
i
became
aware
of
a
more
imminent
danger
on
the
top
of
the
pyramid
at
the
report
of
the
rifle
all
had
fallen
down
flat
on
their
faces
and
it
was
over
them
that
i
had
rushed
to
almah
side
but
these
now
began
to
rise
and
the
hags
took
up
the
corpse
of
the
dead
and
the
paupers
swarmed
around
with
cries
of
mut
mut
dead
dead
and
exclamations
of
wonder
then
they
all
turned
their
foul
and
bleary
eyes
toward
me
and
stood
as
if
transfixed
with
astonishment
at
length
there
burst
forth
from
the
crowd
one
who
sought
to
get
at
me
it
was
the
chief
pauper
he
still
held
in
his
hand
the
long
knife
of
sacrifice
he
said
not
a
word
but
rushed
straight
at
me
and
as
he
came
i
saw
murder
in
his
look
i
did
not
wait
for
him
but
raising
my
rifle
discharged
the
second
barrel
full
in
his
face
he
fell
down
a
shattered
blackened
heap
dead
as
the
second
report
thundered
out
it
drowned
all
other
sounds
and
was
again
followed
by
an
awful
silence
i
looked
around
those
on
the
pyramid
paupers
and
hags
had
again
flung
themselves
on
their
faces
on
the
square
below
the
whole
multitude
were
on
their
knees
with
their
heads
bowed
down
low
the
silence
was
more
oppressive
than
before
it
was
appalling
it
was
tremendous
it
seemed
like
the
dread
silence
that
precedes
the
more
awful
outburst
of
the
hurricane
when
the
storm
is
gathering
up
all
its
strength
to
burst
with
accumulated
fury
upon
its
doomed
victim
but
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
staring
and
that
interval
was
occupied
by
me
in
hastily
reloading
my
rifle
it
was
my
last
resource
now
and
if
it
availed
not
for
defence
it
might
at
least
serve
to
be
used
against
ourselves
with
this
thought
i
handed
the
pistol
to
almah
and
hurriedly
whispered
to
her
that
if
i
were
killed
she
could
use
it
against
herself
she
took
it
in
silence
but
i
read
in
her
face
her
invincible
resolve
the
storm
at
last
burst
the
immense
multitude
rose
to
their
feet
and
with
one
common
impulse
came
pressing
on
from
every
side
toward
the
pyramid
apparently
filled
with
the
one
universal
desire
of
reaching
me
a
desire
which
was
now
all
the
more
intense
and
vehement
from
these
interruptions
which
had
taken
place
why
they
had
fallen
on
their
knees
why
the
paupers
on
the
pyramid
were
still
prostrate
i
could
not
tell
but
i
saw
now
the
swarming
multitude
and
i
felt
that
they
were
rolling
in
on
every
side
merciless
implacable
to
tear
me
to
pieces
yet
time
passed
and
they
did
not
reach
me
for
an
obstacle
was
interposed
the
pyramid
had
smooth
sides
the
stairways
that
led
up
to
the
summit
were
narrow
and
did
not
admit
of
more
than
two
at
a
time
yet
had
the
kosekin
been
like
other
people
the
summit
of
the
pyramid
would
soon
have
been
swarming
with
them
but
as
they
were
kosekin
none
came
up
to
the
top
for
at
the
base
of
the
pyramid
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
i
saw
a
strange
and
incredible
struggle
it
was
not
as
with
us
who
should
go
up
first
but
who
should
go
up
last
each
tried
to
make
his
neighbor
go
before
him
all
were
eager
to
go
but
the
kosekin
and
love
for
the
good
of
others
made
each
one
intensely
desirous
to
make
others
go
up
this
resulted
in
a
furious
struggle
in
which
as
fast
as
anyone
would
be
pushed
up
the
steps
a
little
way
he
would
jump
down
again
and
turn
his
efforts
toward
putting
up
others
and
thus
all
the
energies
of
the
people
were
worn
out
in
useless
and
unavailing
efforts
in
a
struggle
to
which
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
there
could
be
no
end
now
those
on
the
pyramid
began
to
rise
and
soon
all
were
on
their
feet
cries
burst
forth
from
them
all
were
looking
at
us
but
with
nothing
like
hostility
it
was
rather
like
reverence
and
adoration
and
these
feelings
were
expressed
unmistakably
in
their
cries
among
which
i
could
plainly
distinguish
such
words
as
these
ap
ram
mosel
anan
wacosek
sopet
mut
the
father
of
thunder
ruler
of
cloud
and
darkness
judge
of
death
these
cries
passed
to
those
below
the
struggle
ceased
all
stood
and
joined
in
the
cry
which
was
taken
up
by
those
nearest
and
soon
passed
among
all
those
myriads
to
be
repeated
with
thunder
echoes
far
and
wide
at
this
it
suddenly
became
plain
to
me
that
the
danger
of
death
had
passed
away
that
these
people
no
longer
regarded
me
as
a
victim
but
rather
as
some
mighty
being
some
superior
perhaps
supernatural
power
who
was
to
be
almost
worshipped
hence
these
prostrations
these
words
these
cries
these
looks
all
these
told
me
that
the
bitterness
of
death
had
passed
away
at
this
discovery
there
was
for
a
moment
a
feeling
of
aversion
and
horror
within
me
at
filling
such
a
position
that
i
a
weak
mortal
should
dare
to
receive
adoration
like
this
and
i
recoiled
at
the
thought
yet
this
feeling
soon
passed
for
life
was
at
stake
not
my
own
merely
but
that
of
almah
and
i
was
ready
now
to
go
through
anything
if
only
i
might
save
her
so
instead
of
shrinking
from
this
new
part
i
eagerly
seized
upon
it
and
at
once
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
popular
superstition
to
the
utmost
far
away
over
the
crests
of
the
mountains
i
saw
the
golden
edge
of
the
sun
disc
and
the
light
flowed
therefrom
in
broad
effulgence
throwing
out
long
rays
of
glory
in
a
luminous
flood
over
all
the
land
i
pointed
to
the
glorious
orb
and
cried
to
the
paupers
and
to
all
who
were
nearest
in
a
loud
voice
i
am
the
man
of
light
i
come
from
the
land
of
light
i
am
the
father
of
thunder
of
cloud
and
darkness
the
judge
of
death
at
this
the
paupers
all
fell
prostrate
and
cried
out
to
me
to
give
them
the
blessing
of
death
i
made
no
answer
but
leading
almah
to
the
edge
of
the
pyramid
told
her
to
fire
the
pistol
a
million
eyes
were
fixed
on
us
she
held
up
the
pistol
and
fired
immediately
after
i
fired
both
barrels
of
the
rifle
and
as
the
reports
rang
out
and
the
smoke
cleared
away
i
heard
a
mighty
murmur
and
once
more
beheld
all
prostrate
upon
this
i
hurriedly
loaded
again
and
waited
for
further
revelations
all
the
time
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
effect
produced
by
the
rifle
now
in
comparison
with
the
indifference
with
which
it
had
been
regarded
at
my
first
arrival
in
the
country
i
could
not
account
for
it
but
supposed
that
the
excitement
of
a
great
religious
festival
and
the
sudden
death
of
the
chief
pauper
and
the
chief
hag
had
probably
deeply
impressed
them
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
the
whole
multitude
arose
and
once
more
there
came
to
my
ears
the
universal
uproar
of
innumerable
cries
in
the
midst
of
which
i
could
hear
the
words
ap

chapter
xxxi
conclusion
in
the
midst
of
this
the
paupers
and
the
hags
talked
earnestly
together
some
of
those
who
had
been
nearest
in
rank
to
the
late
chief
pauper
and
chief
hag
were
conspicuous
in
the
debate
all
looked
at
me
and
at
almah
and
pointed
toward
the
sun
which
was
wheeling
along
behind
the
distant
mountain
crest
showing
a
golden
disc
then
they
pointed
to
the
dead
bodies
and
the
hags
took
the
chief
hag
and
the
paupers
the
chief
pauper
and
laid
them
side
by
side
on
the
central
altar
after
this
a
hag
and
a
pauper
advanced
toward
us
each
carrying
the
sacrificial
knife
which
had
belonged
to
the
deceased
the
hag
spoke
first
addressing
almah
in
accordance
with
the
kosekin
custom
which
requires
women
to
take
the
precedence
in
many
things
take
this
she
said
o
almah
consort
of
and
of
clouds
and
darkness
henceforth
you
shall
be
judge
of
death
to
the
women
of
the
kosekin
she
then
handed
almah
the
sacrificial
knife
of
the
chief
hag
which
almah
took
in
silence
then
the
pauper
presented
me
with
the
sacrificial
knife
of
the
chief
pauper
with
the
following
words
take
this
o
father
of
thunder
and
ruler
of
clouds
and
darkness
henceforth
you
shall
be
judge
of
death
to
the
men
of
the
kosekin
and
sar
tabakin
over
the
whole
nation
i
received
the
knife
in
silence
for
i
had
nothing
to
say
but
now
almah
spoke
as
was
fitting
for
her
to
do
since
with
the
kosekin
the
women
must
take
the
precedence
and
here
it
was
expected
that
she
should
reply
in
behalf
of
both
of
us
so
almah
holding
the
sacrificial
knife
stood
looking
at
them
full
of
dignity
and
spoke
as
follows
we
will
take
this
o
kosekin
and
we
will
reward
you
all
we
will
begin
our
reign
over
the
kosekin
with
memorable
acts
of
mercy
these
two
great
victims
shall
be
enough
for
the
mista
kosek
of
this
season
the
victims
designed
for
this
sacrifice
shall
have
to
deny
themselves
the
blessing
of
death
yet
they
shall
be
rewarded
in
other
ways
and
all
the
land
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
shall
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
our
rule
to
all
you
hags
and
paupers
we
grant
the
splendid
and
unparalleled
boon
of
exile
to
magones
there
you
can
have
all
the
suffering
which
heart
can
wish
and
inevitable
death
to
all
classes
and
ranks
in
the
whole
nation
we
promise
to
grant
a
diminution
in
their
wealth
by
in
the
abundance
of
our
mercy
we
are
willing
ourselves
to
bear
the
burden
of
all
the
offerings
that
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
accomplish
this
all
in
the
land
may
at
once
give
up
of
their
whole
wealth
to
us
at
this
the
hags
and
paupers
gave
a
horrible
yell
of
applause
as
rulers
of
light
and
darkness
we
will
henceforth
govern
the
nation
in
the
light
as
well
as
in
the
dark
we
will
sacrifice
ourselves
so
far
to
the
public
good
as
to
live
in
the
light
and
in
open
palaces
we
will
consent
to
undergo
the
pains
of
light
and
splendor
to
endure
all
the
evils
of
luxury
magnificence
and
boundless
wealth
for
the
good
of
the
kosekin
nation
we
will
consent
to
forego
the
right
of
separation
and
agree
to
live
together
even
though
we
love
one
another
above
all
we
will
refuse
death
and
consent
to
live
can
any
rulers
do
more
than
this
for
the
good
of
their
people
another
outburst
of
applause
followed
in
three
joms
continued
almah
all
you
hags
and
paupers
shall
be
sent
to
exile
and
death
on
magones
as
for
the
rest
of
the
kosekin
hear
our
words
tell
them
from
us
that
the
laborers
shall
all
be
elevated
to
the
rank
of
paupers
the
artisans
shall
be
made
laborers

there
shall
be
no
meleks
in
all
the
land
we
in
our
love
for
the
kosekin
will
henceforth
be
the
only
meleks
then
all
the
misery
of
that
low
station
will
rest
on
us
and
in
our
low
estate
as
meleks
we
shall
govern
this
nation
in
love
and
tell
them
that
we
will
forego
the
sacrifice
and
consent
to
live
that
we
will
give
up
darkness
and
cavern
gloom
and
live
in
light
tell
them
to
prepare
for
us
the
splendid
palaces
of
the
meleks
for
we
will
take
the
most
sumptuous
and
magnificent
of
them
all
tell
all
the
people
to
present
their
offerings
tell
them
that
we
consent
to
have
endless
retinues
of
servants
soldiers
followers
and
attendants
tell
them
that
with
the
advent
of
almah
and
a
new
era
begins
for
the
kosekin
in
which
every
man
may
be
as
poor
as
he
likes
and
riches
shall
be
unknown
in
the
land
these
extraordinary
words
seemed
to
fill
the
paupers
with
rapture
exclamations
of
joy
burst
from
them
they
prostrated
themselves
in
an
irrepressible
impulse
of
grateful
admiration
as
though
such
promises
could
only
come
from
superior
beings
then
most
of
them
hurried
down
to
communicate
to
the
people
below
the
glorious
intelligence
soon
it
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
all
the
people
were
filled
with
the
wildest
excitement
for
never
before
had
such
a
thing
been
known
and
never
had
such
been
imagined
or
thought
possible
as
that
the
rulers
of
the
kosekin
could
consent
to
be
rich
when
they
might
be
paupers
to
live
together
when
they
might
be
separate
to
dwell
in
the
light
when
they
might
lurk
in
the
deepest
cavern
gloom
to
remain
in
life
when
they
might
have
the
blessing
of
death
selfishness
fear
of
death
love
of
riches
and
love
of
luxury
these
were
all
unintelligible
to
the
kosekin
as
much
as
to
us
would
be
contempt
of
death
voluntary
poverty
and
asceticism
but
as
with
us
rulers
may
make
others
rich
and
be
popular
for
this
so
here
among
the
kosekin
a
selfish
ruler
might
be
popular
by
making
others
poor
hence
the
words
of
almah
as
they
were
made
known
gave
rise
to
the
wildest
excitement
and
enthusiasm
and
the
vast
multitude
poured
forth
their
feelings
in
long
shouts
of
rapturous
applause
amid
this
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
carried
down
from
the
pyramid
and
were
taken
to
the
mista
kosek
in
a
long
and
solemn
procession
accompanied
by
the
singing
of
wild
and
dismal
chants
and
now
the
sun
rolling
along
behind
the
icy
mountain
crest
rose
higher
and
higher
every
moment
and
the
bright
light
of
a
long
day
began
to
illumine
the
world
there
sparkled
the
sea
rising
far
away
like
a
watery
wall
with
the
horizon
high
up
in
the
sky
there
rose
the
circle
of
giant
mountains
sweeping
away
till
they
were
blended
with
the
horizon
there
rose
the
terraces
of
the
amir
all
glowing
in
the
sunlight
with
all
its
countless
houses
and
and
arching
trees
and
pointing
pyramids
above
was
the
canopy
of
heaven
no
longer
black
no
longer
studded
with
stars
or
glistening
with
the
fitful
shimmer
of
the
aurora
but
all
radiant
with
the
glorious
sunlight
and
disclosing
all
the
splendors
of
the
infinite
blue
at
that
sight
a
thrill
of
joy
passed
through
me
the
long
long
night
at
last
was
over
the
darkness
had
passed
away
like
some
hideous
dream
the
day
was
here
the
long
day
that
was
to
know
no
shadow
and
no
decline
when
all
this
world
should
be
illuminated
by
the
sun
a
sun
that
would
never
set
until
his
long
course
of
many
months
should
be
fully
run
my
heart
swelled
with
rapture
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
o
light
i
cried
o
gleaming
golden
sunlight
o
light
of
heaven
light
that
brings
life
and
hope
to
man
and
i
could
have
fallen
on
my
knees
and
worshipped
that
rising
sun
but
the
light
which
was
so
glorious
to
us
was
painful
and
distressing
to
the
kosekin
on
the
top
of
the
pyramid
the
paupers
crouched
shading
their
eyes
the
crowd
below
began
to
disperse
in
all
directions
so
as
to
betake
themselves
to
their
coverts
and
to
the
caverns
where
they
might
live
in
the
dark
soon
nearly
all
were
gone
except
the
paupers
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramid
who
were
awaiting
our
commands
and
a
crowd
of
meleks
and
athons
at
a
distance
at
a
gesture
from
me
the
few
paupers
near
us
descended
and
joined
those
below
almah
and
i
were
alone
on
the
top
of
the
pyramid
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
in
a
rapture
of
joy
this
revulsion
from
the
lowest
despair
from
darkness
and
from
death
back
to
hope
and
light
and
life
was
almost
too
much
to
endure
we
both
wept
but
our
tears
were
those
of
happiness
you
will
be
all
my
own
now
said
i
and
we
can
fly
from
this
hateful
land
we
can
be
united
we
can
be
married
here
before
we
start
and
you
will
not
be
cruel
enough
to
refuse
you
will
consent
will
you
not
to
be
my
wife
before
we
fly
from
the
kosekin
at
this
almah
face
became
suffused
with
smiles
and
blushes
her
arms
were
about
me
and
she
did
not
draw
away
but
looked
up
in
sweet
confusion
and
said
why
as
to
that
i
i
can
not
be
more
your
your
wife
than
i
am
what
do
you
mean
i
exclaimed
in
wonder
my
wife
her
eyes
dropped
again
and
she
whispered
the
ceremony
of
separation
is
with
the
kosekin
the
most
sacred
form
of
marriage
it
is
the
religious
form
the
other
is
merely
the
civil
form
this
was
unintelligible
nor
did
i
try
to
understand
it
it
was
enough
to
hear
this
from
her
own
sweet
lips
but
it
was
a
strange
feeling
and
i
think
i
am
the
only
man
since
adam
that
ever
was
married
without
knowing
it
as
to
flight
continued
almah
who
had
quite
adopted
the
kosekin
fashion
which
makes
women
take
the
lead
as
to
flight
we
need
not
hurry
we
are
now
and
there
is
no
more
danger
we
must
wait
until
we
send
embassies
to
my
people
and
when
they
are
ready
to
receive
us
we
will
go
but
now
let
us
leave
this
for
our
servants
are
waiting
for
us
and
the
light
is
distressing
to
them
let
us
go
to
the
nearest
of
our
palaces
and
obtain
rest
and
food
here
featherstone

and

down
the
manuscript
