her
cross
seems
heavy
she
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
she
heard
the
thud
of
trunks
and
valises
on
the
pavement
outside
she
heard
her
father
s
voice
giving
orders
to
driver
and
porter
she
wondered
why
she
did
not
step
forward
and
open
the
door
how
would
other
girls
greet
their
mothers
she
tried
to
think
some
of
them
she
had
with
whom
she
had
gone
home
in
her
earlier
life
who
were
wont
to
rush
into
their
mother
s
arms
and
with
broken
exclamations
of
delight
smother
her
with
kisses
how
strange
it
would
be
if
she
should
do
any
such
thing
as
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
welcome
a
mother
how
should
she
she
had
never
learned
then
there
was
that
other
one
almost
harder
to
meet
than
a
mother
because
her
father
after
all
had
the
most
responsibility
about
the
mother
it
was
really
his
place
to
look
after
her
needs
and
her
comfort
but
this
sister
would
naturally
look
to
her
for
exclusive
attention
a
sister
she
ruth
erskine
with
a
sister
only
a
few
years
younger
than
herself
and
yet
one
whom
she
had
not
only
never
seen
but
until
the
other
day
of
whose
existence
she
had
never
heard
how
perfectly
unnatural
it
all
was
oh
if
father
had
only
done
differently
this
cry
she
had
groaned
out
from
the
depths
of
her
soul
a
hundred
times
during
the
two
weeks
of
the
father
s
absence
after
she
had
turned
away
from
the
useless
wail
oh
that
all
this
had
never
been
and
resolutely
resolved
not
to
be
weak
and
worthless
and
desert
her
father
in
his
need
and
give
herself
up
to
vain
regrets
she
found
that
the
regretting
only
took
another
form
since
it
was
and
must
be
and
could
not
honorably
be
gotten
away
from
why
had
he
not
faced
the
necessity
long
ago
when
she
was
a
child
why
had
they
not
grown
up
together
feeling
and
understanding
that
they
were
sisters
and
owed
to
each
other
a
sister
s
forbearance
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
if
her
father
had
only
settled
it
years
and
years
ago
and
brought
the
woman
home
and
made
her
position
assured
and
if
the
people
had
long
and
long
ago
settled
down
to
understanding
it
all
what
a
blessed
thing
it
would
have
been
over
and
over
in
various
forms
had
this
argument
been
held
with
ruth
and
her
rebellious
heart
and
it
had
not
helped
her
it
served
to
make
her
heart
throb
wildly
as
she
stood
there
waiting
it
served
to
make
the
few
minutes
that
she
waited
seem
to
her
like
avenging
hours
it
served
to
make
her
feel
that
her
lot
was
fearfully
exceptionally
hopelessly
hard
there
had
been
daughters
before
who
were
called
on
to
meet
new
mothers
yes
but
this
was
an
old
old
old
that
in
the
nature
of
things
she
ought
years
ago
to
have
been
reconciled
to
the
event
and
to
have
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
but
what
daughter
before
this
had
been
called
upon
suddenly
to
greet
and
to
receive
in
social
equality
an
own
sister
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
unnerved
she
felt
and
so
the
door
was
opened
at
last
by
judge
erskine
himself
his
daughter
had
decreed
that
no
servant
should
be
in
attendance
she
wanted
as
few
as
possible
well
daughter
he
said
and
even
in
that
swift
moment
she
wondered
if
he
ever
spoke
that
well
daughter
to
that
other
one
then
she
did
come
forward
and
hold
out
her
hand
and
receive
her
father
s
lingering
kiss
something
in
that
and
in
the
look
of
his
eyes
as
he
put
her
back
from
him
and
gazed
for
an
instant
into
hers
steadied
her
pulses
and
made
her
turn
with
a
welcome
to
the
strangers
there
was
an
almost
pleading
look
in
those
eyes
of
his
how
do
you
do
she
said
simply
and
not
coldly
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
small
woman
who
shrank
back
and
seemed
bewildered
if
not
frightened
do
you
feel
very
tired
with
the
long
journey
susan
said
her
father
to
the
third
figure
who
was
still
over
by
the
door
engaged
in
counting
the
and
satchels
this
is
my
daughter
there
was
an
air
of
ownership
about
this
sentence
which
was
infinitely
helpful
to
ruth
what
if
he
had
said
this
is
your
sister
ruth
she
gave
her
hand
a
cold
hand
it
was
and
she
felt
it
tremble
but
even
in
that
supreme
moment
she
noticed
that
susan
s
hair
was
what
in
outspoken
language
would
be
called
red
and
that
she
was
taller
than
accorded
with
grace
and
her
wrap
falling
back
from
its
confinings
showed
her
dress
to
be
and
otherwise
long
afterward
ruth
smiled
as
she
thought
of
taking
in
such
details
at
such
a
moment
it
transpired
that
there
was
still
another
stranger
awaiting
gentleman
tall
and
grave
and
with
keen
gray
eyes
that
seemed
looking
through
this
family
group
and
drawing
conclusions
my
daughter
judge
this
was
judge
erskine
s
manner
of
introduction
for
the
time
at
least
he
ignored
the
fact
that
he
had
any
other
daughter
very
little
attention
did
the
daughter
bestow
on
judge
burnham
eyes
and
wits
were
on
the
alert
elsewhere
here
were
these
new
people
to
be
gotten
to
their
rooms
and
then
gotten
down
again
and
there
was
that
awful
to
endure
she
gave
herself
to
the
business
of
planning
an
exit
father
you
want
to
go
directly
to
your
rooms
i
suppose
i
have
rung
for
thomas
to
attend
to
judge
burnham
and
i
will
do
the
honors
of
the
house
for
very
carefully
trained
were
face
and
tone
beyond
a
certain
curious
poise
of
head
which
those
who
knew
her
understood
betokened
a
strong
pressure
of
there
was
nothing
unusual
really
the
worst
for
her
was
to
come
if
she
could
but
have
made
herself
feel
that
to
send
a
servant
with
this
new
sister
would
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
but
for
the
watchful
eyes
and
commenting
tongue
of
that
same
servant
she
would
have
done
it
but
she
sternly
resolved
that
everything
which
to
the
servant
s
eyes
would
look
like
formality
or
like
hospitality
extended
simply
to
guests
should
be
dispensed
with
it
would
do
to
ring
for
thomas
to
attend
judge
burnham
but
a
daughter
of
the
house
must
have
no
other
escort
than
herself
on
the
way
she
wondered
what
she
should
say
when
the
room
door
closed
on
them
both
here
in
the
hall
it
was
only
necessary
to
ask
which
satchel
should
go
up
immediately
and
which
trunk
went
to
which
room
but
when
all
the
business
was
settled
what
then
she
began
the
minute
the
attending
servant
deposited
the
satchels
and
departed
do
you
need
to
make
any
change
in
dress
before
tea
and
can
i
assist
you
in
any
way
for
answer
the
young
girl
thus
addressed
turned
toward
her
earnest
gray
that
were
full
of
some
strong
feeling
that
she
was
holding
said
with
eager
heartful
tones
i
am
just
as
sorry
for
you
as
i
can
be
if
there
is
any
way
in
which
i
can
help
to
make
the
cross
less
heavy
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
it
now
this
was
the
last
sentence
that
ruth
erskine
had
expected
to
hear
she
had
studied
over
possible
conversations
and
schooled
herself
to
almost
every
form
but
not
this
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
returning
the
earnest
gaze
with
one
full
of
bewilderment
why
i
mean
that
i
have
some
dim
conception
of
how
hard
how
hard
all
this
is
two
strangers
to
come
into
your
home
and
claim
not
the
attention
accorded
to
guests
but
the
position
belonging
to
home
it
is
dreadful
i
have
felt
so
sorry
for
you
and
for
myself
all
day
that
i
could
not
keep
the
tears
from
my
eyes
i
want
to
make
myself
as
endurable
as
possible
if
you
will
only
show
me
how
i
will
try
very
what
was
ruth
erskine
to
reply
to
this
it
hard
she
felt
too
truthful
to
disclaim
it
just
now
it
seemed
to
her
almost
impossible
to
endure
it
she
tried
to
turn
it
off
lightly
oh
we
shall
live
through
it
she
said
and
the
attempt
to
make
her
voice
unconstrained
startled
even
herself
susan
abated
not
one
whit
the
earnestness
in
her
voice
i
know
we
shall
she
said
because
it
must
be
it
is
because
we
each
have
an
almighty
helper
i
asked
your
father
and
mine
as
soon
as
ever
i
saw
him
whether
you
were
a
christian
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
be
an
impossible
ordeal
if
you
were
not
he
my
father
ruth
i
know
it
is
hard
for
you
to
hear
me
use
that
name
which
you
have
supposed
for
so
many
years
belonged
exclusively
to
you
if
it
had
been
right
i
could
almost
have
made
myself
promise
never
to
use
it
but
it
wouldn
t
be
the
right
way
to
manage
i
am
sure
ruth
you
and
i
shall
both
breathe
freer
and
understand
each
other
better
if
we
admit
from
the
first
that
father
has
done
wrong
in
this
thing
now
i
know
that
is
dreadful
to
say
but
remember
he
is
my
father
i
am
not
to
blame
because
he
loved
your
mother
better
than
he
ever
could
mine
i
am
not
to
blame
for
a
bit
of
the
tragedy
any
more
than
you
are
and
i
have
been
a
sufferer
just
as
you
are
all
my
life
i
have
been
without
a
father
s
love
and
care
all
my
life
i
have
had
to
imagine
what
the
name
father
must
mean
i
am
not
blaming
him
i
am
simply
looking
at
facts
we
shall
do
better
to
face
this
thing
i
really
had
something
to
forgive
he
admitted
it
i
have
forgiven
him
utterly
and
my
heart
just
bleeds
for
him
and
for
you
but
then
we
shall
as
you
say
get
through
all
the
embarrassments
and
come
off
conquerors
in
the
utter
silence
on
ruth
s
part
how
shall
i
confess
to
you
that
this
conversation
disappointed
and
angered
her
she
was
nerved
to
bear
heavy
crosses
if
this
new
sister
had
been
arrogant
or
cringing
or
insufferably
rude
and
exacting
i
think
ruth
would
have
borne
it
well
but
this
simple
quiet
facing
of
difficulties
like
a
grave
announcement
that
she
too
had
been
a
the
steady
tone
in
which
she
pronounced
that
word
father
gave
ruth
a
shiver
of
horror
the
worst
of
it
the
very
of
it
girl
had
spoken
truth
she
a
sufferer
and
through
no
fault
of
her
own
through
judge
erskine
s
pride
and
here
was
the
was
her
father
s
father
who
had
been
one
of
her
strongest
sources
of
pride
during
all
her
proud
days
of
life
it
is
true
enough
she
told
herself
bitterly
but
she
need
not
have
spoken
don
t
want
to
hear
and
then
she
turned
away
and
went
out
of
the
and
paused
in
the
hall
again
resting
her
arm
on
that
chair
and
trying
to
still
the
tumult
in
her
angry
heart
as
for
the
sister
looking
after
her
with
sad
eyes
she
turned
the
key
on
her
at
last
and
then
went
over
to
the
great
beautiful
beautiful
than
any
on
which
she
had
ever
bowed
before
it
on
her
knees
what
if
ruth
erskine
had
had
to
contend
with
a
sister
who
never
got
down
on
her
knees
yet
she
positively
did
not
think
of
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
nothing
could
make
the
cross
more
bitter
than
it
was
she
opened
the
door
at
last
quietly
enough
and
went
forward
to
where
her
father
was
standing
waiting
for
her
or
for
some
to
come
to
him
and
help
him
in
his
bewilderment
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
when
she
saw
him
two
weeks
ago
and
there
was
that
appealing
glance
in
his
eyes
that
touched
his
daughter
a
moment
before
she
had
felt
bitter
toward
him
it
was
gone
now
i
brought
judge
burnham
home
with
me
he
said
speaking
quickly
as
if
to
forestall
any
words
from
her
he
is
an
old
friend
he
was
a
pet
of
your
mother
s
ruth
in
his
boyhood
and
he
knew
all
about
her
and
i
thought
it
would
be
better
than
to
be
quite
alone
at
yes
ruth
said
in
a
tone
that
might
be
assenting
or
it
might
simply
be
answering
in
her
heart
she
did
not
believe
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
have
judge
burnham
in
their
family
circle
and
she
wished
him
away
was
not
the
ordeal
hard
enough
without
having
an
outsider
to
look
on
and
comment
when
will
you
be
ready
for
supper
she
asked
and
though
she
tried
to
make
her
voice
sound
naturally
she
knew
it
was
cold
and
hard
why
as
soon
as
judge
burnham
come
down
he
said
hesitatingly
what
were
they
all
going
to
call
each
other
should
he
say
your
mother
or
should
he
say
mrs
erskine
he
could
not
tell
which
of
the
two
seemed
most
objectionable
to
him
so
he
concluded
to
make
that
foolish
compromise
and
say
where
did
you
leave
susan
he
questioned
in
her
ruth
s
tone
was
colder
than
before
judge
erskine
essayed
to
help
her
she
is
the
only
alleviating
drop
in
this
bitter
cup
he
said
looking
anxiously
at
ruth
for
an
assuring
word
it
has
been
a
comfort
to
me
to
think
that
she
seemed
kind
and
thoughtful
and
in
every
way
disposed
to
do
right
she
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
i
hope
poor
ruth
if
her
father
had
said
she
is
perfectly
unendurable
to
me
you
must
contrive
in
some
way
that
i
shall
not
have
to
see
her
or
hear
her
name
it
would
have
been
an
absolute
relief
to
his
daughter
s
quivering
nerves
it
was
almost
like
an
insult
to
have
him
talk
about
her
being
a
help
and
a
comfort
she
turned
from
him
abruptly
and
felt
the
relief
which
the
opening
door
and
the
entrance
of
judge
burnham
gave
the
pealed
its
summons
through
the
house
and
judge
erskine
went
in
search
of
his
wife
but
ruth
called
irish
kate
to
tell
miss
erskine
that
tea
was
ready
flushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
over
the
name
miss
erskine
and
feeling
vexed
and
mortified
when
she
found
that
judge
burnham
s
grave
eyes
were
on
her
erskine
was
a
dumpy
little
woman
who
wore
a
of
bright
blue
and
dingy
brown
shades
over
a
green
dress
the
green
being
of
the
shade
that
fought
not
only
with
the
wearer
s
complexion
but
with
the
blue
of
the
the
whole
effect
was
simply
dreadful
ruth
looking
at
it
and
at
her
taking
her
in
mentally
from
head
to
foot
shuddered
visibly
what
a
contrast
to
the
grandeur
of
the
man
beside
her
and
yet
what
a
pitiful
thing
human
nature
was
that
it
could
be
so
affected
by
adverse
shades
of
blue
and
green
meeting
on
a
sallow
skin
before
the
tea
was
concluded
it
transpired
that
there
were
worse
things
than
blues
and
greens
judge
erskine
murdered
the
most
common
phrases
of
the
king
s
english
she
said
susan
and
me
was
dreadful
tired
and
she
said
there
was
enough
for
him
and
i
she
even
said
his
n
and
your
n
those
most
detestable
of
all
provincialisms
and
ruth
erskine
sat
opposite
her
and
realized
that
this
woman
must
be
introduced
into
society
as
judge
erskine
her
father
s
wife
there
had
been
an
awkward
pause
about
the
getting
seated
at
the
table
ruth
had
held
back
in
doubt
and
confusion
and
erskine
had
not
seemed
to
know
what
her
proper
place
should
be
and
judge
erskine
had
said
in
pleading
tone
daughter
take
your
old
place
this
and
then
ruth
had
gone
forward
with
burning
cheeks
and
taken
the
seat
opposite
her
father
as
usual
leaving
erskine
to
sit
at
his
right
where
she
had
arranged
her
own
sitting
and
this
circumstance
added
to
all
the
others
had
held
her
thoughts
captive
so
that
she
heard
not
a
word
of
her
father
s
low
reverent
blessing
perhaps
if
she
had
heard
it
might
have
helped
her
through
the
horrors
of
that
evening
there
was
one
thing
that
helped
her
it
was
the
pallor
of
her
father
s
face
she
almost
forgot
herself
and
her
own
embarrassment
in
trying
to
realize
the
misery
of
his
position
her
voice
took
a
gentle
filial
tone
when
she
addressed
him
that
if
she
had
but
known
it
was
like
drops
of
oil
poured
on
the
inflamed
wounds
which
bled
in
his
heart
altogether
that
evening
stood
out
in
ruth
erskine
s
memory
years
afterward
as
the
most
trying
one
of
her
life
there
came
days
that
were
more
serious
in
their
that
left
deeper
of
solemn
sorrow
and
bold
outspoken
trouble
but
for
troubles
so
petty
that
they
irritated
by
their
very
smallness
while
still
they
stung
this
evening
held
foremost
rank
i
wonder
she
said
in
inward
irritation
as
she
watched
erskine
s
awkward
transit
across
the
room
on
her
father
s
arm
and
observed
that
her
dress
was
too
short
for
grace
and
too
low
in
the
neck
and
hung
in
swinging
plaits
in
i
wonder
if
there
are
no
dressmakers
where
they
came
from
and
then
her
lip
curled
in
indignation
with
herself
to
think
that
such
petty
details
should
intrude
upon
her
now
another
thing
utterly
dismayed
her
she
had
thought
so
much
about
this
evening
she
had
prayed
so
earnestly
she
had
almost
expected
to
sail
high
above
it
serene
and
safe
and
do
honor
to
the
religion
which
she
professed
by
the
quietness
of
her
surrender
of
home
and
happiness
for
it
truly
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
surrendering
both
but
it
was
apparent
to
herself
that
she
had
failed
that
she
had
dishonored
her
profession
and
when
this
dreadful
evening
was
finally
over
she
shut
the
door
on
the
outer
world
with
a
groan
as
she
said
aloud
and
bitterly
oh
i
don
t
know
anything
to
prevent
our
home
from
being
a
place
of
perfect
torment
poor
father
and
poor
me
if
she
could
have
heard
judge
burnham
s
comment
made
aloud
also
in
the
privacy
of
his
room
it
might
still
have
helped
her
that
girl
has
it
in
her
power
to
make
riot
and
ruin
of
this
household
or
to
bring
peace
out
of
it
all
i
wonder
which
she
will
do
and
yet
both
judge
burnham
and
ruth
erskine
were
mistaken
chapter
ii
side
issues
how
did
they
ever
get
into
such
a
dreadful
snarl
as
this
anyway
it
was
eurie
mitchel
who
asked
this
question
she
had
seated
her
shipley
and
marion
the
two
chairs
her
small
contained
and
then
curled
herself
fashion
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
to
be
sure
it
is
against
the
rule
at
this
present
time
for
girls
in
to
make
sofas
of
their
beds
so
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
when
eurie
was
a
nevertheless
she
did
it
where
should
i
sit
she
asked
her
mother
one
day
when
that
good
lady
remonstrated
on
the
floor
and
her
mother
looking
around
the
room
and
noting
the
scarcity
of
chairs
and
remembering
that
there
were
none
to
spare
from
any
other
portion
of
the
house
said
sure
enough
and
laughed
off
the
manifest
poverty
revealed
in
the
answer
instead
of
sighing
over
it
and
eurie
went
on
making
a
comfortable
seat
of
her
bed
whenever
occasion
required
on
this
particular
evening
they
had
been
discussing
affairs
at
the
erskine
mansion
and
eurie
had
broken
in
with
her
exclamation
and
waited
for
marion
to
answer
why
said
marion
i
know
very
little
about
it
there
are
all
sorts
of
stories
in
town
just
as
is
always
the
case
but
you
needn
t
believe
any
of
them
there
is
not
enough
truth
sprinkled
in
to
save
them
ruth
says
her
father
married
at
a
time
when
he
was
weak
both
in
body
and
getting
up
from
a
long
and
very
serious
illness
during
which
this
woman
had
nursed
him
with
patience
and
skill
and
the
doctors
said
saved
his
life
he
discovered
in
some
don
t
know
whether
she
told
him
so
or
not
but
somehow
he
made
the
she
lost
possession
of
her
heart
during
the
process
and
that
he
had
gotten
it
without
any
such
intention
on
his
part
and
in
a
fit
of
gratitude
he
married
her
in
haste
and
repented
at
how
perfectly
absurd
said
eurie
in
indignation
the
idea
that
he
had
no
way
of
showing
his
gratitude
but
by
standing
up
with
her
and
assenting
to
half
a
dozen
solemn
statements
none
of
which
were
true
and
making
promises
that
he
couldn
t
keep
i
have
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
well
but
said
flossy
coming
in
with
gentle
tone
and
alleviating
words
just
as
she
always
did
come
into
the
talk
of
these
two
the
woman
was
a
poor
friendless
girl
then
living
a
dreadful
life
entirely
dependent
on
her
needle
for
her
daily
bread
think
how
sorry
he
must
have
been
for
her
eurie
s
lip
curled
he
might
have
been
as
sorry
for
me
as
he
pleased
and
i
dare
say
i
shouldn
t
have
cared
if
he
had
expressed
his
sorrow
in
dollars
and
cents
but
to
go
and
marry
me
promise
to
love
and
cherish
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
not
to
mean
a
word
of
it
was
simply
have
you
been
studying
the
marriage
service
lately
marion
asked
with
a
light
laugh
and
a
vivid
blush
you
seem
strangely
familiar
with
why
i
have
heard
it
several
times
in
my
life
eurie
answered
quickly
her
cheeks
answering
the
other
s
blushes
and
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
a
ceremony
not
to
be
trifled
oh
i
think
so
too
flossy
said
in
great
seriousness
and
sweet
earnestness
but
what
i
mean
is
judge
erskine
of
course
did
not
realize
what
he
was
promising
it
was
only
a
little
after
ruth
s
mother
died
you
know
and
i
think
he
could
not
have
known
what
he
was
i
should
think
not
said
eurie
and
then
to
deliberately
desert
her
afterward
living
a
lie
all
these
years
i
must
say
i
think
judge
erskine
has
behaved
as
badly
as
a
man
no
said
marion
he
has
repented
he
might
have
gone
on
with
his
lie
to
the
end
of
life
and
she
would
have
made
no
sign
it
seems
the
can
keep
a
promise
whether
he
can
or
not
but
think
what
it
must
have
cost
him
to
have
told
all
this
to
ruth
why
i
would
rather
tell
my
faults
to
the
president
than
to
ruth
erskine
oh
i
think
he
has
shown
that
there
is
nobility
in
his
nature
and
sincerity
in
his
recent
profession
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
have
consoled
his
conscience
with
the
plea
that
it
was
too
late
to
make
amends
still
i
confess
i
think
as
you
do
eurie
marriage
is
a
very
solemn
to
be
entered
into
lightly
i
should
think
and
when
its
vows
are
taken
they
are
to
be
lived
by
i
don
t
feel
very
gracious
toward
judge
still
if
the
lord
jesus
and
his
own
daughter
can
forgive
him
i
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it
was
flossy
s
voice
and
quiet
but
with
that
curious
suggestion
of
power
behind
it
that
flossy
s
voice
had
taken
of
late
it
served
to
quiet
the
two
girls
for
a
minute
then
marion
said
flossy
shipley
i
m
not
sure
but
you
have
our
share
of
as
well
as
heart
to
be
sure
in
one
sense
it
is
none
of
our
business
i
don
t
believe
he
cares
much
whether
we
ever
forgive
him
or
not
but
i
believe
i
shall
and
feel
sorry
for
him
too
what
a
precious
muddle
he
has
made
of
life
how
are
they
ever
going
to
endure
that
woman
is
she
so
very
dreadful
this
was
eurie
s
insinuating
question
father
and
nellis
called
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
go
with
them
i
was
sure
i
shouldn
t
know
what
to
say
to
ruth
i
tried
to
have
them
describe
her
but
father
said
she
must
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
and
nell
would
do
nothing
but
shrug
his
shoulders
and
she
is
simply
terrible
marion
said
with
emphasis
i
didn
t
stay
fifteen
minutes
and
i
heard
more
bad
grammar
and
bad
taste
in
the
use
of
language
than
i
hear
in
school
in
a
week
and
her
style
of
dressing
said
marion
pausing
to
consider
a
strong
way
of
putting
is
enough
i
should
think
to
drive
ruth
erskine
wild
you
know
i
am
not
remarkable
for
nervousness
in
that
direction
and
not
supposed
to
be
posted
as
to
styles
but
really
it
would
try
my
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
considerably
to
have
to
tolerate
such
combinations
as
she
gets
up
then
she
is
fussy
and
garrulous
and
ignorant
and
in
every
way
disagreeable
i
really
don
t
know
how
i
am
ever
and
at
that
point
marion
wilbur
suddenly
stopped
what
about
the
daughter
eurie
asked
well
said
marion
i
hardly
know
she
impresses
you
strangely
she
is
homely
that
is
at
first
sight
you
would
consider
her
very
homely
indeed
red
why
that
shouldn
t
be
as
much
the
orthodox
color
as
brown
is
a
matter
of
fashion
i
she
is
large
featured
and
angular
and
has
the
air
and
bearing
that
would
be
called
exceedingly
plain
for
all
that
there
is
something
very
interesting
about
her
i
studied
her
for
half
an
hour
and
couldn
t
decide
what
it
was
it
isn
t
her
smile
for
she
was
extremely
grave
hardly
smiled
at
all
and
i
m
not
sure
that
it
is
her
dare
say
that
might
be
called
i
came
away
having
a
feeling
of
respect
for
her
a
sort
of
liking
that
i
couldn
t
define
and
couldn
t
get
away
nellis
liked
her
said
eurie
he
was
quite
decided
in
his
opinion
said
she
was
worth
a
dozen
frippery
girls
with
banged
hair
and
trains
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
he
couldn
t
give
a
definite
reason
any
more
than
you
can
why
he
approved
of
her
as
he
called
i
don
t
know
what
her
tastes
can
be
continued
marion
she
doesn
t
play
at
all
she
told
me
and
she
doesn
t
sing
nor
daub
in
paints
that
is
one
comfort
for
ruth
she
won
t
have
to
endure
the
piano
nor
help
hang
pictures
in
true
lights
lights
they
may
be
but
i
should
imagine
she
read
some
things
that
were
worth
reading
she
didn
t
parade
her
knowledge
however
if
she
has
any
in
short
she
is
a
mystery
rather
i
should
like
you
to
see
perhaps
she
is
fond
of
suggested
flossy
somewhat
timidly
whereupon
marion
laughed
i
don
t
fancy
you
are
to
find
a
kindred
spirit
in
that
direction
my
dear
little
kittie
she
said
lightly
no
one
to
glance
at
susan
erskine
would
think
of
for
the
whole
evening
there
is
nothing
in
her
face
or
manner
or
about
her
attire
that
would
suggest
the
possibility
of
her
knowing
anything
about
fancy
matters
of
any
sort
i
tell
you
her
face
is
a
strange
one
i
found
myself
quoting
to
my
inner
consciousness
the
sentence
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
every
time
i
looked
at
the
lines
about
her
mouth
whatever
else
she
can
or
can
not
do
i
am
morally
certain
that
she
can
t
crochet
girls
think
of
that
erskine
doesn
t
it
sound
strangely
how
do
you
suppose
it
sounds
to
ruth
i
tell
you
this
whole
thing
is
dreadful
i
can
t
feel
reconciled
to
it
do
you
suppose
she
will
have
to
call
that
woman
mother
what
does
she
call
her
now
well
principally
she
doesn
t
call
her
at
all
she
says
you
at
rare
intervals
when
she
has
to
speak
to
her
and
she
said
she
when
she
spoke
of
her
to
me
not
speaking
disagreeably
you
know
but
hesitatingly
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
what
would
be
expected
of
her
oh
ruth
does
well
infinitely
better
than
i
should
in
her
circumstances
i
feel
sure
i
said
as
much
to
that
disagreeable
judge
burnham
who
keeps
staying
there
for
no
earthly
reason
that
i
can
see
except
to
complicate
ruth
s
trials
how
does
your
friend
bear
up
under
it
he
asked
me
with
an
insinuating
air
as
though
he
expected
me
to
reveal
volumes
she
bears
it
royally
just
as
she
always
does
everything
i
said
and
i
was
dreadfully
tempted
to
add
don
t
you
see
how
patiently
she
endures
your
presence
here
just
as
though
i
would
tell
him
anything
about
it
if
she
tore
around
like
a
lunatic
oh
well
now
said
eurie
oracularly
there
are
worse
crosses
in
life
i
dare
say
than
ruth
s
having
to
call
that
woman
of
course
there
are
nobody
doubts
it
the
difficulty
is
that
particular
type
of
cross
has
just
now
come
to
her
and
while
she
doesn
t
have
to
bear
those
others
which
are
worse
she
have
to
bear
that
and
it
is
a
cross
and
she
needs
grace
to
help
exactly
as
much
grace
as
though
there
wasn
t
anyone
on
earth
called
on
to
bear
a
harder
trial
i
never
could
understand
why
my
burnt
finger
should
pain
me
any
the
less
because
somebody
else
had
burned
her
entire
at
this
point
flossy
interrupted
the
conversation
with
one
of
those
innocent
earnest
questions
which
she
was
always
in
these
days
asking
to
the
no
small
confusion
of
some
classes
of
people
are
these
two
women
christians
that
i
don
t
know
marion
answered
after
staring
at
the
questioner
a
moment
in
a
half
dazed
way
i
wondered
it
too
i
remember
flossy
shipley
i
thought
of
you
while
i
sat
there
and
i
said
to
myself
she
would
be
certain
to
make
the
discovery
in
less
time
than
i
have
spent
talking
with
but
i
don
t
know
how
you
do
those
things
what
way
was
there
for
me
to
tell
i
couldn
t
sit
down
beside
them
and
say
are
you
a
christian
could
i
how
is
it
to
be
done
flossy
looked
bewildered
why
she
said
hesitatingly
i
don
t
know
i
never
thought
there
was
anything
strange
about
it
why
shouldn
t
those
things
be
talked
of
as
well
as
any
others
you
discovered
whether
the
young
lady
was
fond
of
music
and
painting
i
can
t
see
why
it
wouldn
t
have
been
just
as
easy
to
have
found
out
about
her
interests
in
more
important
but
how
would
you
have
done
it
just
suppose
yourself
to
have
been
in
judge
erskine
s
parlor
surrounded
by
all
those
people
who
were
there
last
evening
how
would
you
have
introduced
the
subject
which
is
of
the
most
importance
why
said
flossy
looking
puzzled
how
do
i
know
how
can
i
tell
unless
i
had
been
there
and
talked
it
over
you
might
as
well
ask
me
how
i
should
have
introduced
the
question
for
instance
whether
they
knew
roberts
supposing
they
had
come
from
the
same
city
and
i
had
reason
to
think
it
they
were
his
friends
it
seems
to
me
i
should
have
referred
to
it
very
naturally
and
that
i
should
have
been
apt
to
do
it
early
in
our
conversation
now
you
know
it
is
quite
not
they
are
intimate
friends
of
the
lord
jesus
why
couldn
t
i
have
asked
them
about
him
marion
and
eurie
looked
at
each
other
in
a
sort
of
puzzled
amusement
then
marion
said
still
i
am
not
sure
that
you
have
answered
my
question
about
how
to
begin
on
such
a
subject
you
know
you
could
have
said
did
you
meet
roberts
in
boston
supposing
them
to
have
been
in
boston
but
you
could
hardly
say
did
you
meet
the
lord
jesus
there
i
am
not
sure
but
that
sounds
irreverent
to
you
i
don
t
mean
it
to
be
i
really
want
to
understand
how
those
subjects
present
themselves
to
your
i
don
t
believe
i
can
tell
you
flossy
said
simply
they
have
no
special
way
of
presenting
themselves
it
is
all
so
new
to
me
that
i
suppose
i
haven
t
gotten
used
to
it
yet
i
am
always
thinking
about
it
and
wondering
whether
any
new
people
can
tell
me
anything
new
now
i
am
interested
in
what
you
told
me
about
that
susan
and
i
feel
as
though
i
should
like
to
ask
her
whether
there
were
any
very
earnest
christians
where
she
used
to
live
and
whether
they
had
any
new
ways
of
reading
the
bible
and
whether
the
young
ladies
had
a
and
all
those
things
you
again
marion
and
eurie
exchanged
glances
this
didn
t
sound
abrupt
or
out
of
place
or
in
any
sense
offensive
to
ideas
of
propriety
yet
who
talked
in
that
way
among
their
acquaintances
and
flossy
gotten
ahead
of
them
in
all
these
things
it
was
a
standing
subject
of
wonderment
among
those
girls
how
flossy
had
outstripped
them
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
eurie
suddenly
changed
the
current
of
thought
how
strange
that
these
changes
should
have
come
to
ruth
and
we
know
nothing
about
it
until
a
mother
and
sister
were
actually
domiciled
we
are
all
so
intimate
too
it
seems
that
there
are
matters
about
which
we
have
not
learned
to
talk
ruth
was
always
more
reserved
than
the
rest
of
us
flossy
said
i
am
not
so
surprised
at
not
knowing
about
affairs
we
are
more
communicative
i
think
at
least
i
have
told
you
all
about
the
changes
that
are
to
come
to
me
and
i
think
you
would
tell
me
if
you
had
anything
startling
wouldn
t
you
marion
rose
up
and
went
over
to
flossy
and
bending
kissed
her
fair
cheek
you
little
pink
blossom
she
said
with
feeling
i
ll
tell
you
all
the
nice
things
i
can
think
of
one
of
these
days
in
the
meantime
i
must
go
home
and
remember
eurie
you
are
not
to
do
anything
dreadful
of
any
sort
without
telling
flossy
and
me
i
won
t
said
eurie
with
a
conscious
laugh
and
the
trio
separated
two
hours
later
marion
wilbur
was
the
recipient
of
the
following
note
dear
marion
i
promised
to
tell
i
don
t
intimate
that
this
comes
under
your
prescribed
limit
of
things
still
i
want
to
tell
you
i
am
almost
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
like
little
flossy
and
talked
it
all
over
freely
with
you
someway
i
couldn
t
seem
to
the
truth
is
i
am
to
be
married
in
six
week
s
time
to
harrison
think
of
my
being
a
minister
s
wife
but
he
is
going
away
from
here
and
perhaps
i
can
learn
there
the
ice
is
broken
now
i
can
tell
you
about
it
come
as
soon
as
you
can
and
as
flossy
says
have
a
quiet
little
lovingly
it
was
about
this
very
hour
that
eurie
opened
and
looked
at
in
a
maze
of
astonishment
and
bewilderment
a
dainty
envelope
of
special
size
and
design
from
which
there
fell
marion
wilbur
s
chapter
iii
a
cross
of
lead
i
do
not
know
that
i
need
even
try
to
tell
you
about
the
succession
of
petty
trials
and
embarrassments
that
haunted
ruth
erskine
s
way
during
the
next
few
days
they
belonged
to
that
class
of
trials
hard
to
hard
indeed
that
at
times
the
spirit
shrinks
away
in
mortal
terror
and
feels
that
it
can
bear
no
more
and
yet
in
the
telling
to
a
listener
they
dwindle
in
importance
as
for
ruth
she
did
not
lived
them
everything
was
so
new
nothing
in
or
about
the
house
could
go
on
according
to
the
old
fashion
and
yet
there
was
no
new
fashion
shaped
she
saw
many
a
thing
which
she
must
not
do
and
but
few
things
that
seemed
to
bear
doing
she
must
stop
in
the
act
of
ordering
dinner
and
remember
in
confusion
that
it
was
not
her
business
to
order
dinners
in
this
house
any
more
and
yet
she
must
remember
that
the
nominal
mistress
seemed
to
know
no
more
about
ordering
dinners
for
a
family
of
eight
than
she
knew
about
ten
thousand
other
things
that
were
waiting
for
her
attention
poor
ruth
struggled
and
groaned
and
wondered
and
rarely
cried
but
grew
paler
if
possible
than
before
and
her
forehead
was
continually
drawn
either
with
lines
of
pain
or
of
intense
she
congratulated
herself
that
her
father
escaped
some
of
the
misery
he
went
early
to
his
office
shutting
the
door
on
the
incongruous
elements
in
his
household
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
going
out
into
the
business
world
where
everything
and
everybody
were
as
usual
and
returning
late
giving
as
little
time
to
the
home
puzzle
as
possible
yet
it
wore
on
him
ruth
could
see
that
and
it
but
increased
her
burden
to
feel
that
the
struggle
she
made
to
help
was
so
manifest
a
and
was
in
some
sense
a
failure
he
detained
her
one
morning
in
the
library
with
that
special
word
of
detention
which
as
yet
he
had
never
applied
to
any
one
but
her
my
daughter
let
me
see
you
a
moment
before
i
go
out
do
you
think
we
ought
to
try
to
have
some
friends
come
in
in
a
social
way
at
this
question
ruth
stood
aghast
her
father
s
friends
had
hitherto
not
been
hard
for
her
to
judges
professional
men
of
different
degrees
of
prominence
often
without
their
wives
and
when
the
ladies
were
included
they
were
of
an
age
as
a
rule
to
expect
little
in
the
way
of
entertainment
from
ruth
except
a
gracious
attention
to
their
comfort
so
that
beyond
very
careful
directions
issued
to
very
competent
servants
and
a
general
outlook
on
the
perfected
arrangements
little
had
been
expected
of
her
but
now
it
was
different
other
than
professional
people
would
expect
invitations
and
besides
the
hostess
was
no
hostess
at
not
know
what
to
what
was
infinitely
more
painful
what
to
do
no
wonder
that
ruth
was
appalled
over
this
new
duty
looming
before
her
yet
of
course
it
was
a
she
flushed
over
the
thought
that
her
father
had
been
obliged
to
suggest
it
of
course
people
were
expecting
introductions
of
course
they
would
of
them
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
have
a
gathering
of
a
few
friends
before
the
great
world
pounced
in
upon
them
so
they
might
feel
that
at
least
with
a
few
the
ordeal
of
introduction
was
over
i
don
t
mean
a
large
party
her
father
hastened
to
explain
just
a
few
professional
ones
you
know
but
some
of
your
new
acquaintances
in
the
church
perhaps
i
thought
you
might
like
to
have
a
gathering
somewhat
like
that
which
you
told
me
of
at
our
little
friend
flossy
shipley
if
he
had
not
been
looking
down
at
the
grate
just
then
instead
of
into
his
daughter
s
face
he
would
have
seen
her
start
and
almost
catch
her
breath
over
this
suggestion
it
was
not
that
she
was
jealous
of
little
flossy
for
whom
her
father
had
shown
very
special
and
tender
regard
ever
since
the
which
he
attended
in
her
company
but
it
came
to
her
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
change
that
had
fallen
upon
them
to
think
that
be
making
an
attempt
to
have
a
social
gathering
like
unto
one
that
flossy
shipley
had
planned
we
couldn
t
do
the
things
that
she
did
ruth
said
quickly
the
elements
which
we
would
have
to
bring
together
would
be
too
no
he
answered
not
exactly
like
hers
of
course
but
something
simple
and
informal
i
thought
your
three
friends
would
come
and
dennis
you
know
and
people
of
that
stamp
who
understand
and
will
help
us
wouldn
t
it
be
well
to
try
to
do
something
of
the
kind
daughter
or
doesn
t
the
idea
meet
with
your
approval
oh
yes
she
said
drawing
in
her
breath
yes
father
we
must
do
something
i
will
try
but
i
hardly
know
how
to
commence
you
know
i
am
not
mistress
of
the
house
now
it
makes
it
difficult
for
i
know
he
said
and
the
expression
of
his
face
led
his
daughter
instantly
to
regret
that
she
had
made
such
a
remark
it
was
the
life
she
lived
at
this
words
and
regretting
that
she
had
done
so
they
went
on
however
perfecting
the
arrangements
for
the
social
gathering
there
had
occurred
to
ruth
an
instant
trouble
in
the
way
which
was
that
one
in
the
american
woman
s
we
can
not
hasten
this
thing
she
said
there
will
need
to
be
some
shopping
done
and
some
is
i
should
think
there
would
need
to
she
corrected
herself
and
the
embarrassment
involved
in
the
fact
that
she
was
not
the
mistress
of
the
new
comers
presented
itself
suppose
they
chose
to
think
they
had
clothes
enough
and
proposed
to
appear
in
any
of
the
materials
which
seemed
to
compose
their
wardrobe
if
they
were
only
two
children
that
she
might
shut
up
in
a
back
room
and
turn
the
key
on
outsiders
until
such
time
as
they
could
be
made
presentable
what
a
relief
it
would
be
evidently
her
father
appreciated
that
embarrassment
i
tried
to
arrange
that
matter
before
i
came
home
he
said
i
furnished
money
and
suggested
as
well
as
i
could
but
it
didn
t
work
i
hardly
know
what
was
the
trouble
they
didn
t
understand
or
something
ruth
what
can
you
do
about
it
is
there
any
way
of
managing
ruth
tried
to
consider
while
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
heart
beat
hard
in
what
way
she
could
suggest
to
her
father
to
manage
his
wife
and
daughter
would
listen
to
suggestions
i
think
she
said
slowly
but
i
don
t
know
whether
and
then
she
broke
off
and
recurred
to
another
of
the
endless
trials
of
this
time
if
she
and
her
father
were
to
be
compelled
to
hold
conversations
concerning
this
woman
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
they
come
to
an
understanding
as
to
what
to
call
her
father
she
said
plunging
desperately
into
the
depths
of
the
question
what
am
i
to
call
her
does
do
that
i
should
say
mother
no
he
said
quickly
surely
not
unless
well
then
ruth
said
after
waiting
in
vain
for
him
to
conclude
am
i
to
say
mrs
erskine
oh
i
don
t
he
spoke
in
visible
agitation
and
commenced
a
walk
up
and
down
the
room
i
don
t
know
anything
about
any
of
this
miserable
business
sometimes
i
am
very
sorely
tempted
to
wish
that
i
had
left
everything
as
it
was
and
gone
on
in
my
old
life
and
endured
the
don
t
said
ruth
aghast
at
this
evidence
of
desperate
feeling
and
roused
for
a
moment
from
minor
considerations
into
a
higher
plane
don
t
feel
in
this
way
father
we
will
do
the
best
we
can
and
it
will
all
come
out
right
at
least
we
will
try
to
do
what
is
he
came
over
to
her
then
standing
before
her
looking
into
her
eyes
and
there
was
that
look
in
his
which
had
touched
her
before
ruth
if
we
there
was
any
way
that
we
to
them
a
little
it
would
make
the
whole
thing
so
much
better
both
for
them
and
what
an
amazing
thing
to
say
what
an
almost
ludicrous
thing
when
one
reflected
that
he
was
talking
about
his
yet
none
knew
better
than
did
ruth
that
implying
love
did
not
make
love
how
pitiful
this
appealing
sentence
was
how
could
her
father
ever
hope
to
learn
to
like
this
woman
who
was
his
wife
for
herself
she
had
not
even
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
trying
the
most
she
had
planned
for
was
to
endure
to
not
to
like
most
certainly
never
to
she
stood
dumbly
before
her
father
having
no
word
of
help
for
him
and
presently
he
turned
from
her
with
a
sigh
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
tone
well
daughter
do
the
best
you
can
manage
everything
exactly
as
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
about
the
dress
question
talk
with
susan
if
you
can
tell
her
what
will
be
you
want
done
i
will
see
that
her
mother
follows
her
directions
for
the
rest
we
will
manage
some
way
we
shall
have
to
depend
on
the
kindness
of
our
friends
judge
burnham
will
help
us
in
any
way
he
can
he
understands
this
suggested
to
ruth
to
inquire
in
regard
to
him
what
is
judge
burnham
staying
in
town
for
where
he
staying
anyway
why
he
lives
in
town
he
is
practicing
here
didn
t
you
know
it
he
has
been
absent
a
long
time
on
professional
business
i
hardly
know
how
it
has
happened
that
you
have
never
met
him
until
now
he
has
a
ten
miles
or
so
away
from
the
city
he
is
there
a
good
deal
i
presume
but
he
boards
now
at
the
leighton
house
he
was
about
changing
boarding
places
when
we
came
home
it
was
for
that
reason
among
others
that
i
invited
him
to
stop
with
us
for
a
few
days
you
like
him
don
t
you
ruth
this
last
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
and
almost
anxiety
expressed
in
his
manner
oh
yes
said
ruth
half
in
impatience
as
one
to
whom
the
subject
was
too
unimportant
to
stop
over
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
flitting
determination
that
whatever
other
person
she
might
be
called
upon
to
like
she
would
never
trouble
herself
to
make
any
effort
of
that
sort
for
and
then
she
went
away
to
plan
for
a
party
in
which
she
was
to
be
the
real
head
while
appearing
before
the
world
only
as
the
dutiful
daughter
to
plan
also
for
the
new
mother
and
sister
s
they
would
or
not
trusting
to
her
father
s
authority
to
make
them
submissive
to
her
schemes
a
little
more
talk
about
that
matter
of
liking
people
ruth
was
destined
to
hear
and
it
developed
ideas
that
bewildered
her
it
chanced
that
flossy
shipley
came
in
for
a
little
chat
with
ruth
over
the
recent
astounding
news
connected
with
their
mutual
friend
marion
it
chanced
also
that
the
were
both
up
stairs
for
the
evening
erskine
being
one
of
those
persons
who
indulge
in
frequent
during
which
time
her
daughter
susan
was
her
devoted
slave
so
judge
erskine
sat
with
his
daughter
book
in
hand
because
conversation
between
them
was
now
of
necessity
on
such
trying
subjects
that
they
mutually
avoided
it
but
he
rarely
turned
a
leaf
and
he
greeted
flossy
shipley
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
and
asked
almost
pleadingly
if
he
might
stay
and
listen
to
their
gossip
very
glad
assent
flossy
gave
and
emphasized
it
by
talking
to
ruth
with
as
much
apparent
freedom
as
though
he
were
absent
i
like
it
she
said
speaking
of
marion
i
think
she
will
make
such
a
perfectly
splendid
minister
s
flossy
still
dealt
largely
in
superlatives
and
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
grammatical
position
of
her
adjectives
i
am
almost
sorry
that
i
am
not
going
to
live
here
so
i
could
have
the
benefit
of
her
she
will
be
just
as
full
of
helpful
plans
for
people
and
when
she
gets
in
a
position
to
influence
them
you
will
see
how
much
good
she
can
do
ruth
were
you
very
much
surprised
greatly
so
i
imagined
that
she
did
not
even
admire
dennis
very
much
i
don
t
know
that
she
ever
gave
me
reason
to
think
so
except
by
being
silent
sometimes
when
i
expected
her
to
speak
but
of
course
that
is
accounted
for
now
isn
t
the
marriage
sudden
more
sudden
than
they
had
planned
flossy
said
dr
dennis
found
it
necessary
to
be
absent
just
then
on
a
matter
of
business
and
to
go
west
just
in
the
direction
they
had
proposed
to
go
together
and
he
was
obliged
to
be
absent
for
some
time
which
would
give
him
little
chance
for
vacation
later
in
the
season
and
in
short
said
flossy
with
a
bright
smile
i
think
if
they
would
own
it
they
were
very
lonely
and
very
anxious
to
enjoy
each
other
s
society
and
thought
they
were
wasting
time
and
set
about
finding
reasons
why
they
should
change
their
plans
you
know
reasons
can
almost
always
be
found
for
things
when
we
are
very
anxious
to
find
them
is
that
so
judge
erskine
asked
looking
up
from
his
book
and
speaking
in
so
earnest
a
tone
that
both
girls
turned
toward
him
inquiringly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
one
were
anxious
to
say
his
opinion
of
a
person
he
could
bring
himself
to
do
it
on
reasonable
grounds
it
was
a
curious
question
and
to
ruth
it
was
a
very
embarrassing
one
her
cheeks
flushed
painfully
and
her
eyes
drooped
to
the
bit
of
fancy
work
which
lay
idly
in
her
lap
that
wasn
t
quite
what
i
was
thinking
about
flossy
said
gently
and
seriously
as
one
who
realized
that
his
question
reached
deeper
than
he
meant
her
to
understand
but
i
do
truly
think
sir
that
if
we
feel
as
though
we
to
change
our
opinion
of
a
person
we
can
set
seriously
about
doing
it
and
accomplish
in
that
case
you
would
not
believe
it
necessary
to
have
any
enemies
in
this
world
would
you
not
real
enemies
i
think
though
i
wouldn
t
want
to
be
friends
of
course
with
everybody
judge
erskine
i
can
t
explain
to
you
what
i
mean
i
don
t
know
how
to
reason
you
see
all
i
can
do
is
to
tell
you
what
really
occurred
there
is
a
person
whom
i
disliked
he
was
very
trying
to
me
and
i
had
to
be
thrown
in
his
society
very
often
and
i
knew
i
ought
to
feel
differently
toward
him
because
you
know
i
couldn
t
hope
to
be
of
the
least
help
to
him
unless
i
felt
differently
so
i
set
myself
earnestly
to
trying
and
i
succeeded
i
have
the
kindest
possible
feelings
toward
him
and
i
think
i
am
gaining
a
little
during
this
recital
flossy
s
fair
cheek
had
taken
a
deeper
shade
and
her
eyes
drooped
low
she
was
giving
what
judge
erskine
felt
was
a
bit
of
and
he
did
not
know
that
she
realized
any
personal
application
how
should
the
innocent
little
mouse
know
anything
about
his
affairs
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
set
to
work
to
accomplish
this
change
he
asked
and
his
daughter
knew
that
his
voice
was
almost
husky
first
said
flossy
simply
and
gravely
i
prayed
for
him
i
gave
all
my
soul
to
a
desire
for
his
conversion
i
prayed
to
be
shown
how
to
help
to
act
toward
him
then
i
prayed
for
grace
to
like
him
to
be
interested
in
him
and
to
overlook
his
faults
or
his
failings
and
i
am
not
sure
there
is
any
then
to
it
it
is
all
told
in
that
word
the
lord
jesus
helped
me
judge
erskine
that
is
the
whole
of
do
you
really
think
we
have
a
right
to
pray
about
the
matter
of
our
likes
and
dislikes
there
was
no
mistaking
the
earnestness
in
judge
erskine
s
voice
this
time
flossy
turned
wondering
eyes
on
him
as
she
said
oh
yes
indeed
the
direction
is
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
and
that
is
a
real
care
you
ah
judge
erskine
know
and
then
he
says
in
by
prayer
and
supplication
let
your
requests
be
made
i
couldn
t
doubt
my
right
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
duty
not
only
to
pray
but
actually
to
supplicate
to
coax
you
know
just
as
i
was
so
tempted
to
do
when
a
child
it
seemed
blessed
to
me
to
think
that
the
lord
jesus
took
such
minute
notice
of
our
human
nature
that
he
knew
it
would
help
us
to
be
allowed
to
keep
a
subject
constantly
before
him
and
to
keep
coaxing
about
it
don
t
you
think
that
is
wonderful
judge
erskine
wonderful
repeated
judge
erskine
in
a
moved
tone
and
he
arose
and
began
that
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
which
always
with
him
indicated
deep
feeling
ruth
and
flossy
presently
continued
their
talk
in
a
lower
tone
until
judge
erskine
came
toward
them
again
and
said
i
will
bid
you
i
think
and
thank
you
my
dear
young
lady
your
words
are
strong
and
helpful
don
t
forget
them
in
any
future
experience
of
life
that
you
may
have
perhaps
they
will
help
you
through
deep
waters
some
then
he
went
to
the
library
as
for
ruth
she
sought
her
room
with
two
thoughts
following
her
one
that
flossy
had
been
to
her
father
what
had
failed
in
helper
and
the
other
that
possibly
she
might
pray
herself
into
a
different
state
of
feeling
toward
this
woman
and
this
girl
who
were
to
her
now
only
heavy
crosses
chapter
iv
bitter
herbs
the
morning
of
the
night
which
had
closed
in
gloom
opened
to
ruth
erskine
with
a
faint
promise
of
better
things
not
so
much
that
either
rather
she
resolved
on
heroism
the
sun
shone
and
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
breath
of
coming
spring
the
outlook
seemed
more
hopeful
ruth
resolved
upon
trying
flossy
s
way
she
would
pray
about
this
matter
she
would
nerve
herself
for
duty
and
trial
she
would
bear
whatever
of
disagreeableness
came
athwart
her
plans
no
matter
how
obstinate
or
offensive
this
new
woman
proved
herself
to
be
on
the
question
of
wardrobe
she
would
bravely
face
the
ordeal
and
do
what
she
could
no
amount
of
offensiveness
should
cause
her
to
lose
it
was
childish
and
useless
to
yield
in
this
way
and
let
inevitable
trials
crush
one
she
did
not
mean
to
do
it
her
father
should
see
that
she
could
be
as
strong
over
trials
as
flossy
shipley
could
be
over
imaginary
ones
for
what
had
that
little
kitten
ever
had
to
try
her
this
ruth
said
with
a
curl
of
her
handsome
upper
lip
she
went
about
her
morning
duties
with
something
like
the
briskness
of
her
old
life
and
settled
herself
to
resolved
on
finding
something
to
help
her
she
had
not
yet
learned
the
best
ways
of
reading
in
the
bible
indeed
she
had
not
given
that
subject
the
attention
which
flossy
had
to
begin
a
chapter
and
read
directly
and
seriously
through
it
getting
what
information
she
could
was
the
most
that
she
as
yet
knew
about
the
matter
and
the
chapter
occurring
next
to
the
one
that
she
read
yesterday
was
the
fifth
of
romans
therefore
being
justified
by
faith
we
have
peace
with
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
also
we
have
access
by
faith
into
this
grace
wherein
we
stand
and
rejoice
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
god
and
not
only
so
but
we
glory
in
tribulations
also
knowing
that
tribulation
worketh
patience
and
patience
experience
and
experience
thus
on
through
the
solemn
and
wonderful
chapter
heeding
the
words
indeed
getting
some
sort
of
idea
of
paul
s
meaning
and
yet
not
making
his
experience
personal
in
the
least
not
realizing
that
the
sentence
we
have
peace
with
god
included
ruth
erskine
not
seeing
at
least
that
it
was
a
present
promise
referring
to
present
experience
not
realizing
anything
save
a
desire
to
be
armed
for
unpleasant
and
continuous
duties
and
a
dim
idea
that
reading
the
bible
was
one
of
the
preparations
which
were
given
her
to
make
in
much
the
same
spirit
she
knelt
to
pray
she
was
humble
she
was
reverent
she
was
in
earnest
she
prayed
for
strength
for
wisdom
for
patience
and
the
words
were
strictly
proper
and
in
accordance
with
the
desires
the
prayer
to
a
listener
would
have
breathed
the
spirit
of
confidence
and
faith
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
ruth
erskine
arose
from
her
knees
without
any
sense
of
having
really
communed
with
christ
without
any
realization
of
his
presence
and
without
any
very
definite
expectation
of
receiving
actual
practical
benefit
from
the
exercise
she
did
not
realize
the
feeling
and
yet
she
possessed
somewhat
of
the
same
spirit
of
the
child
who
prayed
dear
jesus
help
me
to
be
good
i
know
i
can
be
good
if
i
try
and
i
intend
to
try
but
you
can
help
me
if
you
want
to
remember
i
do
not
say
that
she
realized
it
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
she
went
out
from
her
room
to
meet
the
trials
of
the
day
strong
in
the
strength
of
her
own
resolves
she
repaired
at
once
to
judge
erskine
s
room
determined
to
be
very
composed
and
patient
and
to
combat
whatever
disagreeable
or
dissenting
thing
might
be
said
with
forbearance
and
kindness
erskine
s
objection
to
new
and
fine
clothing
must
be
overcome
but
it
should
be
done
wisely
she
resolved
to
say
nothing
to
susan
beforehand
she
would
not
admit
even
to
herself
that
her
father
s
evident
confidence
in
susan
s
powers
was
a
trial
to
her
but
all
the
same
she
determined
to
show
him
that
she
too
had
powers
and
that
she
could
manage
matters
without
susan
s
help
alas
for
ruth
erskine
was
not
in
the
least
averse
to
fine
feathers
she
was
not
lofty
nor
angry
nor
hurt
she
was
and
ungrammatically
and
exasperatingly
loquacious
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
ruth
to
endure
she
was
nerved
for
that
unconsciously
she
had
planned
for
and
prayed
for
to
enable
her
to
endure
not
what
she
would
meet
in
erskine
but
what
she
would
have
had
to
contend
with
in
herself
had
she
been
in
erskine
s
place
and
as
given
the
same
circumstances
the
two
would
act
in
a
totally
different
manner
failure
was
inevitable
come
in
said
erskine
heartily
in
answer
to
ruth
s
low
knock
land
alive
come
right
in
don
t
stop
to
rap
what
s
the
use
of
being
so
particular
with
one
s
folks
i
been
a
wishin
you
would
run
in
and
have
a
chat
i
was
tellin
your
pa
only
last
night
how
chirk
and
nice
we
could
all
be
here
if
you
would
be
sort
of
sociable
you
know
and
not
so
stiff
and
not
that
you
mean
to
be
proud
i
s
pose
susan
says
you
don
t
she
says
it
s
natural
for
some
folks
to
be
haughty
i
s
pose
it
is
but
land
alive
i
m
glad
i
m
not
one
of
them
kind
haughty
folks
always
did
shrivel
me
right
up
set
down
here
by
the
fire
i
think
these
grates
is
real
comfortable
i
told
your
pa
last
night
that
i
wouldn
t
have
shivered
over
an
old
barn
of
a
all
these
years
if
i
d
known
what
comfortable
things
there
was
in
the
world
how
dreadful
pale
you
look
is
it
natural
for
you
to
look
so
like
a
ghost
all
the
time
i
am
not
accustomed
to
having
a
great
deal
of
color
in
my
face
i
believe
ruth
answered
sitting
squarely
and
stiffly
in
the
most
uncomfortable
chair
she
could
find
in
the
room
and
feeling
just
then
that
to
be
an
actual
ghost
would
be
a
positive
relief
well
now
i
don
t
believe
it
s
nature
for
any
human
being
to
be
so
like
a
sheet
as
that
if
i
was
your
pa
i
d
have
you
through
a
course
of
medicine
in
less
than
no
time
you
need
strengthenin
up
you
ought
to
have
some
peruvian
bark
or
some
quassia
chips
or
some
kind
of
bitter
stuff
steeped
up
for
you
to
drink
it
would
do
you
a
power
of
good
i
know
it
would
you
jest
let
me
fix
you
up
a
mess
like
i
do
susan
and
see
what
it
ll
do
for
you
s
prise
your
pa
with
the
change
in
you
i
dare
poor
ruth
she
felt
as
though
stuff
that
was
bitter
enough
had
been
mixed
and
steeped
and
held
to
her
lips
and
that
she
was
being
obliged
to
drink
it
to
the
very
dregs
she
need
it
was
it
possible
that
the
divine
physician
saw
her
need
of
such
bitter
herbs
as
these
which
had
fallen
to
her
lot
she
started
and
even
flushed
a
little
over
the
sudden
thought
did
not
believe
it
this
was
her
sin
not
hers
it
had
only
fallen
upon
her
because
of
the
old
solemn
law
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
upon
the
she
hurried
her
thoughts
away
from
it
it
would
not
do
to
sit
in
that
room
with
that
woman
staring
at
her
and
indulge
in
questionings
like
these
i
came
in
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
in
the
way
of
shopping
you
will
need
something
new
i
suppose
before
the
gathering
of
friends
which
my
father
proposes
to
ruth
had
decided
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
new
garments
were
to
be
bought
and
thus
forestall
if
she
could
haughty
objections
she
need
not
have
been
thus
careful
erskine
had
stated
truly
that
she
was
not
one
of
the
haughty
sort
she
had
no
objection
to
any
number
of
new
dresses
and
to
their
being
made
as
elaborately
as
possible
now
you
speak
of
it
i
dare
say
i
do
she
said
leaning
back
complacently
in
her
comfortable
little
rocker
in
fact
your
pa
spoke
of
that
very
thing
this
morning
he
said
like
enough
you
would
tend
to
it
and
he
filled
my
up
handsome
there
ain
t
a
stingy
streak
about
your
pa
i
knew
that
years
and
years
ago
when
he
was
a
young
man
it
was
the
very
first
thing
that
drawed
me
to
free
kind
of
way
in
which
he
threw
around
his
money
it
seemed
so
specially
when
i
was
drivin
every
nerve
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
and
lived
among
folks
that
didn
t
dare
to
say
their
bodies
was
their
own
for
fear
they
would
have
em
seized
on
for
debt
and
took
to
jail
i
tell
you
that
was
livin
you
don
t
know
nothing
about
it
and
i
hope
to
the
land
that
you
never
what
could
ruth
do
but
groan
inwardly
and
wish
that
her
father
had
been
in
his
youth
the
veriest
miser
that
ever
walked
the
earth
anything
so
that
this
terrible
woman
would
not
have
been
drawed
to
him
she
tried
to
hurry
the
question
what
have
you
thought
of
getting
she
asked
nervously
twisting
and
untwisting
the
tassels
of
the
tidy
against
which
she
leaned
and
feeling
disagreeably
conscious
that
a
glow
of
color
had
mounted
to
her
very
temples
in
her
efforts
at
land
alive
i
don
t
know
i
ve
thought
of
a
dozen
different
dresses
since
your
pa
told
me
this
morning
what
he
wanted
he
wants
things
to
be
awful
nice
i
can
see
that
and
why
shouldn
t
he
a
man
that
s
got
money
and
is
free
with
it
has
a
right
to
say
what
he
will
have
i
m
sure
i
think
it
ought
to
be
something
bright
like
you
this
last
with
such
a
distressing
little
simper
that
it
was
almost
more
than
ruth
could
do
to
keep
from
rushing
from
that
awful
room
and
declaring
to
her
father
that
she
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
this
thing
he
should
fight
his
dreadful
battles
alone
but
outwardly
she
held
still
and
the
shrill
uncultured
little
voice
went
on
you
see
i
almost
like
a
bride
meeting
your
pa
s
friends
so
for
the
first
time
though
land
knows
it
is
long
enough
ago
that
i
planned
what
to
wear
when
i
should
meet
em
it
took
longer
to
get
ready
than
i
there
was
not
even
a
spice
of
bitterness
in
this
sentence
if
there
had
there
had
been
a
suggestion
that
this
woman
felt
somewhat
of
her
own
wrongs
ruth
thought
that
she
could
have
borne
it
better
but
the
tone
was
simply
contemplative
as
of
one
who
was
astonished
in
a
mild
way
over
the
tragedy
that
life
had
managed
to
get
up
for
her
you
see
she
continued
i
hadn
t
a
chance
for
much
dressin
or
thinkin
about
it
your
pa
was
so
weak
that
i
had
about
all
i
could
do
to
fix
bitters
and
things
and
manage
to
keep
the
breath
of
life
in
his
body
and
many
s
the
time
when
i
thought
he
d
beat
and
die
right
before
my
face
and
eyes
in
spite
of
me
then
he
went
off
on
that
journey
afore
he
was
able
and
i
ve
always
believed
and
always
shall
that
he
didn
t
rightly
know
what
he
was
about
after
that
for
quite
a
spell
so
now
i
think
more
than
likely
it
would
please
him
to
have
things
kind
of
gay
and
lively
i
ain
t
said
anything
about
it
to
ha
n
t
no
special
interest
in
dressing
up
anyway
and
she
and
i
don
t
always
agree
about
what
looks
nice
but
i
think
your
pa
would
like
it
if
i
had
a
green
rich
green
you
know
nothing
dull
and
fady
i
saw
one
when
i
was
a
is
i
sewed
on
it
was
for
a
bride
too
and
i
said
to
myself
then
says
i
if
ever
a
bride
i
ll
have
a
dress
as
much
like
this
as
two
i
ve
been
a
good
while
about
it
but
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
i
ve
got
a
beautiful
red
bow
that
wide
kind
of
ribbon
a
woman
give
it
to
me
for
tending
up
to
her
poor
girl
afore
she
died
she
had
the
consumption
and
i
took
care
of
her
off
and
on
a
good
share
of
the
fall
and
she
give
me
this
ribbon
it
s
real
nice
though
land
knows
i
didn
t
want
pay
for
doing
things
for
her
poor
girl
twan
t
neither
for
the
matter
of
that
it
was
just
to
show
they
felt
grateful
you
know
and
i
ve
always
set
store
by
that
ribbon
i
ve
never
wore
it
because
susan
she
thought
it
wan
t
suited
to
our
way
of
livin
and
no
more
it
wan
t
though
we
lived
nice
enough
in
a
small
way
your
pa
never
skimped
us
on
money
though
land
alive
i
didn
t
dream
of
his
havin
things
about
him
like
he
has
and
i
was
always
for
tryin
to
lay
up
cause
i
didn
t
know
how
much
money
he
had
and
i
didn
t
know
but
he
d
come
to
poverty
some
day
rich
folks
do
and
i
was
for
savin
and
susan
didn
t
object
susan
is
a
good
girl
as
ever
was
and
so
the
red
bow
is
just
as
nice
as
ever
it
a
mite
soiled
nor
nothing
and
i
think
it
would
go
lovely
with
a
green
silk
dress
don
t
you
no
said
ruth
severely
and
solemnly
not
another
word
could
she
have
forced
her
white
lips
to
say
and
i
don
t
know
how
to
explain
to
you
what
awful
torture
this
talk
was
to
her
the
truth
is
to
those
of
you
who
do
not
because
of
a
fine
subtle
inner
sympathy
understand
it
already
it
is
utterly
unexplainable
land
alive
said
erskine
startled
by
the
brief
explosive
answer
and
by
the
white
set
lips
don
t
you
now
i
thought
you
would
you
dress
so
like
a
picture
yourself
i
thought
you
would
know
all
about
it
and
your
pa
said
you
knew
what
was
what
as
well
as
the
next
think
of
judge
erskine
s
aristocratic
lips
delivering
such
a
sentence
as
that
now
i
had
a
geranium
once
when
i
was
a
girl
it
was
the
only
pretty
thing
i
had
in
the
world
and
i
set
store
by
it
for
more
reasons
than
one
it
was
give
to
me
by
my
own
aunt
on
my
father
s
side
it
was
pretty
nigh
all
she
had
to
give
poor
thing
they
was
dreadful
poor
like
the
rest
of
us
and
she
give
me
this
the
very
winter
she
died
i
had
it
up
in
my
room
and
it
kept
a
blowing
and
blowing
all
winter
never
see
the
like
of
that
thing
to
blow
and
i
used
to
stand
and
look
at
it
just
between
daylight
and
dark
it
stood
right
by
my
one
window
where
the
last
streak
of
daylight
come
in
and
i
used
to
squeeze
in
there
between
the
table
and
the
wall
to
make
my
and
when
it
got
so
dark
i
jest
couldn
t
take
another
stitch
i
d
stand
and
look
at
the
thing
all
in
blow
and
i
thought
i
never
see
anything
so
pretty
in
all
my
life
and
i
made
up
my
mind
then
and
there
that
a
green
silk
dress
about
the
color
of
them
leaves
and
a
red
ribbon
about
the
color
of
them
blossoms
would
be
the
prettiest
thing
to
wear
in
the
world
i
got
the
bow
a
good
many
years
ago
and
i
was
always
kind
of
savin
on
it
up
waiting
for
the
just
here
there
was
the
faintest
little
breath
of
a
sigh
but
then
if
you
don
t
think
it
would
be
the
thing
why
i
m
willing
to
leave
it
to
you
your
pa
said
you
d
see
that
everything
was
i
think
said
ruth
and
her
voice
was
hollow
even
to
herself
i
think
that
my
father
s
taste
would
be
a
plain
black
silk
with
white
lace
at
the
throat
if
you
desire
to
please
him
i
am
sure
you
will
make
that
why
exclaimed
judge
erskine
and
she
couldn
t
help
looking
a
bit
dismayed
land
alive
do
you
think
so
black
why
it
will
make
folks
think
of
a
funeral
won
t
it
no
said
ruth
black
is
worn
on
all
occasions
by
persons
who
know
enough
to
wear
then
she
arose
she
had
reached
the
utmost
limit
of
endurance
another
sentence
from
this
woman
she
felt
would
have
driven
her
wild
yet
she
was
doomed
to
hear
one
more
before
she
closed
the
door
after
herself
well
now
if
you
honestly
think
it
will
be
best
i
s
pose
i
ll
agree
to
it
as
your
pa
seemed
to
think
things
must
go
your
way
but
i
don
t
quite
like
it
jest
because
it
seems
kind
of
bad
luck
i
don
t
believe
them
notions
about
black
clothes
at
you
know
though
when
i
was
a
girl
folks
honestly
thought
so
and
it
seems
kind
of
pokerish
to
run
right
into
em
i
never
would
begin
to
clean
house
of
a
bad
luck
was
sure
to
come
and
as
for
seein
the
moon
over
my
left
shoulder
i
won
t
do
it
if
i
can
help
it
but
black
silk
ain
t
so
funeral
as
bombazine
and
such
and
i
s
here
ruth
slammed
the
door
and
put
both
trembling
hands
to
her
ears
and
ran
across
the
hall
to
the
refuge
of
her
own
room
and
closed
and
locked
and
her
door
as
for
erskine
she
relapsed
of
necessity
into
silence
and
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
ceased
her
rocking
and
looked
meditatively
into
the
glowing
grate
then
she
arose
and
for
the
second
time
that
morning
her
speech
was
heralded
by
the
breath
of
a
sigh
as
she
said
aloud
i
ain
t
no
ways
certain
that
i
can
ever
make
head
or
tail
to
that
then
she
went
to
her
new
and
elegant
and
opened
a
drawer
and
drew
from
under
a
pile
of
snowy
clothing
a
little
box
and
took
therefrom
wrapped
in
several
folds
of
tissue
paper
the
treasured
bow
she
had
kept
it
choicely
for
fourteen
years
always
with
a
dim
sense
of
feeling
that
the
time
might
come
when
life
would
so
have
opened
to
her
that
she
would
be
able
to
add
to
it
the
green
silk
dress
and
appear
in
triumph
besides
it
represented
to
her
so
much
gratitude
and
affection
and
there
was
actually
on
her
small
worn
withered
face
the
suspicion
of
a
tear
as
she
carefully
folded
and
replaced
it
her
audible
comment
was
a
black
silk
dress
and
a
white
lace
bow
land
alive
chapter
seeking
help
for
the
rest
of
the
day
ruth
was
in
gloom
indeed
i
might
almost
say
she
was
in
despair
in
a
dim
dreary
sort
of
way
she
felt
that
her
refuge
had
failed
her
if
it
really
was
not
going
to
help
her
to
read
in
the
bible
and
pray
what
she
to
do
now
i
do
not
mean
that
she
suddenly
lost
faith
in
the
bible
or
in
prayer
but
simply
that
despairing
thoughts
like
these
ran
riot
through
her
brain
and
she
gave
them
attention
also
she
felt
as
though
any
effort
to
help
or
any
attempt
to
like
these
even
to
tolerate
impossible
erskine
s
coarseness
of
tone
and
speech
her
horrible
arrangement
of
words
and
phrases
her
frequent
allusions
to
your
pa
in
the
free
careless
tone
which
indicated
a
partnership
of
interest
between
them
were
all
so
many
horrors
to
the
refined
reserved
daughter
i
will
just
shut
myself
into
my
room
she
said
pacing
back
and
forth
like
a
caged
lion
i
will
not
try
to
associate
with
them
it
can
never
be
done
they
can
not
be
improved
there
is
no
hope
in
that
direction
there
is
nothing
to
build
on
i
must
just
take
care
of
myself
and
see
to
it
that
i
do
not
sink
to
their
carrying
out
this
plan
or
rather
allowing
herself
to
glide
along
with
it
she
turned
away
with
almost
a
shiver
from
her
father
s
question
that
evening
addressed
to
her
in
a
low
tone
as
the
family
were
leaving
the
daughter
shall
we
try
to
go
to
the
first
since
this
invasion
into
their
home
ruth
had
not
forgotten
it
instead
she
had
been
looking
forward
all
day
to
that
meeting
as
a
refuge
for
her
soul
without
giving
really
definite
thought
to
it
she
yet
felt
that
there
at
least
would
be
help
and
comfort
and
not
once
had
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
must
be
invited
to
attend
she
realized
now
with
a
throb
of
pain
that
it
was
this
sense
of
fleeing
from
their
presence
which
had
helped
to
give
pleasantness
to
the
thought
of
the
meeting
was
it
possible
that
must
be
taken
father
i
can
t
she
said
turning
and
facing
him
with
glowing
face
and
defiant
eyes
i
have
tried
to
help
and
have
been
an
awful
failure
i
just
feel
as
though
i
could
not
endure
it
no
i
say
let
us
stay
at
home
with
our
misery
and
not
parade
it
before
a
gaping
world
no
i
am
not
going
to
her
father
turned
from
her
and
walked
without
another
word
to
the
library
whither
according
to
the
new
rules
of
the
house
they
went
directly
after
tea
for
prayer
ruth
could
not
help
noticing
that
her
father
s
tall
handsome
form
stooped
as
though
he
were
bowed
with
years
the
moment
those
words
were
spoken
she
felt
that
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
unsaid
them
but
to
take
back
what
has
been
said
in
haste
and
folly
is
oftentimes
an
impossible
task
she
chose
the
darkest
corner
of
the
library
and
felt
that
if
she
could
have
crouched
in
it
out
of
sight
forever
it
would
have
been
happiness
her
father
s
voice
as
he
read
the
psalm
for
the
evening
was
low
and
tremulous
he
had
by
no
means
gotten
used
to
these
new
not
felt
their
comfort
nor
recognized
in
them
a
help
as
yet
he
was
in
the
realm
of
hard
his
prayer
touched
ruth
as
no
prayer
had
ever
done
before
it
opened
the
fountains
of
tears
on
rising
from
her
knees
she
turned
quickly
to
the
window
to
hide
her
disturbed
face
and
to
determine
whether
she
should
follow
her
father
from
the
room
and
apologizing
for
the
hard
unhelpful
words
which
she
had
spoken
say
that
of
course
they
must
go
to
he
did
not
wait
for
her
tardy
resolution
but
turned
at
once
to
his
wife
will
you
and
susan
accompany
me
to
our
weekly
meeting
i
feel
that
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
and
that
is
one
of
the
sources
of
susan
answered
promptly
and
with
a
glad
ring
in
her
voice
that
he
could
not
have
failed
to
notice
she
was
so
glad
to
hear
that
this
was
the
evening
for
the
meeting
she
had
been
thinking
about
it
and
wondering
whether
it
were
and
whether
she
could
go
as
for
the
mother
she
said
hesitatingly
why
yes
she
supposed
so
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
that
she
knew
of
she
was
no
great
hand
for
going
out
evenings
though
to
be
sure
going
out
in
a
city
where
the
walks
were
good
and
the
streets
as
light
as
day
was
a
different
affair
from
blundering
along
in
the
dark
as
had
been
obliged
to
do
susan
always
went
to
but
she
hadn
t
never
went
in
her
life
as
she
knew
of
but
then
of
course
if
wanted
to
go
she
would
go
along
it
was
not
possible
apparently
for
erskine
to
answer
a
question
briefly
she
was
full
of
reminiscences
they
went
to
father
and
mother
and
ruth
said
this
sentence
over
after
they
were
all
it
as
she
listened
to
the
sound
of
their
retreating
father
and
all
the
mother
she
had
ever
known
and
their
daughter
she
was
left
out
her
father
had
not
given
her
opportunity
to
change
her
mind
he
had
simply
said
as
they
passed
out
i
am
sorry
daughter
that
you
do
not
feel
like
accompanying
if
he
had
but
said
daughter
won
t
you
go
she
would
have
choked
down
the
tears
and
answered
but
she
could
not
bring
her
pride
or
her
grief
to
make
this
concession
she
honestly
did
not
know
whether
to
call
it
pride
or
grief
bitterly
sorry
was
she
to
miss
the
she
began
to
feel
that
even
with
those
two
present
it
might
have
helped
her
so
sorry
was
she
that
had
she
dared
to
traverse
the
streets
alone
she
would
have
made
ready
and
followed
while
she
still
stood
looking
out
drearily
too
sad
now
even
for
tears
the
bell
sounded
through
the
quiet
house
and
giving
little
heed
to
it
she
was
presently
startled
by
the
advent
of
judge
burnham
thomas
thought
no
one
was
in
he
said
coming
toward
her
after
an
instant
s
surprised
pause
and
i
ventured
to
avail
myself
of
your
father
s
cordial
invitations
and
come
in
to
consult
a
book
which
he
has
and
i
haven
it
was
well
for
judge
burnham
s
peace
of
mind
that
he
had
not
come
in
expecting
to
see
ruth
she
was
in
the
mood
to
resent
such
an
intrusion
but
since
it
was
only
books
that
he
wanted
he
was
welcome
she
motioned
toward
the
rows
and
rows
of
volumes
as
she
said
help
yourself
judge
burnham
and
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
you
can
my
father
s
friends
are
always
welcome
to
his
then
judge
burnham
said
a
strange
and
unexpected
word
standing
there
looking
at
her
with
those
keen
grave
eyes
of
his
thinking
apparently
not
of
books
at
all
he
said
i
wish
i
could
help
something
in
the
tone
and
something
in
the
emphasis
caused
a
vivid
blush
to
spread
over
ruth
s
face
she
commenced
a
haughty
sentence
thank
you
i
am
sure
it
is
kind
she
was
about
to
say
but
i
do
not
feel
in
need
of
she
was
stopped
by
the
swift
realization
that
this
was
not
true
she
felt
in
one
sense
in
deeper
need
of
help
than
she
had
ever
done
before
her
voice
faltered
over
the
words
and
finally
she
stopped
her
eyes
drooping
as
they
were
not
wont
to
droop
before
others
and
those
traitorous
tears
shone
in
them
again
the
tearful
mood
was
as
foreign
to
her
usual
self
as
possible
and
she
felt
afraid
to
trust
herself
to
speak
further
besides
what
could
she
say
judge
burnham
spoke
again
earnestly
respectfully
i
hope
you
will
forgive
my
intrusion
of
sympathy
but
i
do
feel
for
in
a
way
that
you
can
hardly
appreciate
there
are
circumstances
in
my
own
hard
life
that
serve
to
make
me
in
deep
sympathy
with
your
present
trial
besides
your
father
has
confided
in
me
fully
and
i
knew
mother
when
i
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
she
was
a
woman
young
and
beautiful
and
good
she
helped
me
in
a
hundred
of
those
nameless
ways
in
which
a
woman
can
help
a
motherless
boy
if
there
was
any
way
in
which
i
could
serve
her
daughter
it
would
give
me
sincerest
pleasure
to
do
he
was
so
frank
and
sincere
and
grave
that
ruth
could
hardly
help
being
sincere
also
i
need
help
she
said
raising
her
eyes
for
an
instant
to
his
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
you
or
any
human
being
can
give
it
me
i
shall
have
to
get
a
victory
over
my
own
heart
before
anything
can
help
me
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
and
disheartened
things
that
i
mean
to
do
i
utterly
fail
in
and
things
that
above
all
others
i
don
t
intend
to
do
i
drop
into
almost
of
necessity
it
seems
to
what
a
pity
that
this
man
who
wanted
to
help
had
not
been
familiar
with
the
cry
of
the
soul
for
the
good
that
i
would
i
do
not
but
the
evil
which
i
would
not
that
i
but
he
was
not
familiar
with
that
book
of
the
law
of
the
human
heart
still
he
essayed
to
comfort
i
think
you
are
too
hard
on
yourself
i
told
you
that
your
father
had
made
a
confidant
of
me
and
among
other
things
he
has
repeatedly
told
me
what
a
help
and
strengthener
you
were
to
him
he
said
that
he
never
would
have
been
able
to
carry
this
hard
matter
through
but
for
your
strong
unselfish
words
it
was
of
you
he
thought
most
and
when
you
were
unselfish
he
felt
that
he
could
ruth
needed
this
crumb
of
comfort
and
yet
it
had
its
bitter
side
and
brought
another
rush
of
tears
he
will
never
speak
such
words
again
she
said
and
her
voice
trembled
i
have
failed
him
utterly
he
asked
me
to
go
to
the
and
i
refused
i
said
i
could
never
go
out
with
them
anywhere
and
that
we
ought
to
stay
at
home
and
hide
our
and
having
broken
through
the
wall
of
reserve
to
this
degree
poor
ruth
gave
way
utterly
and
dropped
into
a
chair
weeping
bitterly
presently
she
said
i
would
give
the
world
to
be
able
to
take
it
back
again
but
i
can
t
i
should
have
gone
to
the
meeting
was
no
excuse
i
have
dishonored
my
saviour
as
well
as
my
judge
burnham
looked
down
at
her
in
perplexed
dismay
no
definite
purpose
had
been
in
his
mind
beyond
a
very
strange
sympathy
for
her
and
a
desire
to
show
it
but
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
deal
with
tears
nor
with
trouble
which
reached
to
so
deep
and
solemn
a
place
in
the
heart
as
this
he
was
one
of
those
reverent
correct
moralists
professing
to
honor
the
bible
as
a
very
wise
and
a
very
good
book
professing
to
respect
religion
and
honor
the
name
of
god
and
knowing
no
more
about
any
of
these
subjects
than
that
profession
indicates
when
it
goes
no
farther
how
was
he
to
comfort
one
whose
bitterest
tears
were
being
shed
because
she
had
dishonored
the
lord
he
waited
irresolute
for
a
moment
then
as
if
a
sudden
and
very
brilliant
thought
had
struck
him
his
face
brightened
if
that
would
really
be
a
source
of
help
to
you
miss
erskine
and
he
tried
not
to
have
his
tone
appear
incredulous
though
at
that
very
moment
he
was
occupied
in
wondering
what
it
could
possibly
do
for
her
why
not
reconsider
your
decision
and
attend
it
i
will
see
you
safely
there
with
pleasure
and
i
presume
your
coming
would
gratify
your
father
in
his
present
for
to
this
man
the
religion
of
his
old
friend
judge
erskine
was
simply
a
mood
which
he
expected
to
be
exchanged
presently
for
some
other
fancy
ruth
looked
up
quickly
was
there
possibly
an
escape
from
this
torture
of
was
there
a
chance
to
show
her
father
that
she
was
bitterly
ashamed
of
herself
isn
t
it
too
late
she
asked
and
the
eagerness
in
her
voice
was
apparent
oh
no
i
should
think
not
and
judge
burnham
drew
his
watch
i
am
not
very
well
versed
in
the
ways
of
these
gatherings
but
if
it
were
a
lecture
or
concert
it
is
not
enough
past
the
hour
to
cause
remark
i
am
quite
willing
to
brave
criticism
in
that
respect
if
you
say
had
ruth
been
less
engrossed
with
the
affairs
of
her
own
troubled
heart
she
would
have
taken
in
the
strangeness
of
this
offer
on
judge
burnham
s
part
to
accompany
her
to
a
truth
to
tell
he
could
have
echoed
erskine
s
statement
that
she
hadn
t
never
went
in
her
life
as
she
knew
he
smiled
now
over
the
newness
of
his
position
and
yet
he
cared
very
little
about
it
there
matters
in
which
judge
burnham
had
moral
courage
enough
to
face
the
whole
world
to
appear
in
a
social
meeting
with
judge
erskine
s
daughter
was
one
of
them
as
for
ruth
true
to
her
nature
she
thought
nothing
about
it
but
made
ready
with
a
speed
and
an
eagerness
that
would
have
amazed
her
attendant
could
he
have
seen
her
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
first
church
again
had
a
sensation
the
was
quite
full
since
the
revival
there
had
been
none
of
those
distressing
meetings
composed
of
a
handful
of
the
most
staid
members
of
the
church
but
on
this
particular
evening
there
were
more
present
than
usual
there
were
some
who
were
not
in
the
habit
of
being
seen
there
even
of
late
shall
i
venture
to
tell
the
reason
the
simple
truth
is
that
dennis
and
marion
wilbur
s
were
out
as
eurie
mitchell
has
before
told
you
many
things
had
conspired
to
make
their
change
of
plans
advisable
and
so
instead
of
being
married
in
the
of
the
old
western
according
to
marion
s
fancy
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
in
the
first
church
on
the
following
evening
and
every
member
of
that
church
young
and
old
large
and
small
had
received
a
special
invitation
to
be
present
now
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
general
gossip
is
confined
to
small
villages
and
towns
where
everybody
knows
everybody
s
business
better
than
he
knows
it
himself
i
think
the
experience
of
others
will
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
gossip
runs
riot
everywhere
in
the
larger
towns
or
cities
it
runs
in
eddies
or
circles
this
clique
or
this
set
or
this
grade
of
society
is
to
a
man
and
woman
as
deeply
interested
in
what
the
particular
circle
are
to
or
or
next
as
though
they
lived
in
a
place
measuring
three
square
miles
so
while
there
were
those
in
this
nameless
city
of
which
we
write
who
said
when
they
heard
of
the
coming
ceremony
dr
dennis
why
he
is
pastor
of
the
first
church
isn
t
he
or
is
it
the
central
church
who
is
marion
wilbur
does
anybody
know
and
while
there
were
those
who
rushed
to
and
fro
through
the
streets
of
the
city
passing
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
first
church
who
did
not
know
that
there
was
to
be
a
wedding
there
who
could
not
tell
you
the
name
of
the
pastor
of
the
church
nor
even
whether
it
had
a
pastor
or
not
and
who
had
never
heard
of
marion
wilbur
in
their
lives
and
never
would
till
those
lives
were
ended
though
some
of
them
brushed
past
her
occasionally
there
were
undeniably
those
who
hurried
through
their
duties
this
evening
or
shook
off
their
weariness
or
or
deferred
other
engagements
and
made
it
convenient
to
go
to
the
first
church
for
no
better
reasons
than
a
curious
desire
to
see
whether
dennis
would
appear
any
different
from
usual
on
the
night
before
his
marriage
and
whether
marion
would
be
out
and
whether
she
look
as
unconscious
and
unconcerned
as
she
always
had
and
also
what
she
whether
she
would
cling
to
that
old
brown
dress
to
the
very
last
and
whether
grace
dennis
would
be
present
and
whether
she
would
sit
with
marion
as
they
remembered
she
had
several
times
or
where
these
and
a
dozen
other
matters
of
equal
importance
and
interest
had
actually
contributed
to
the
filling
of
the
seats
in
the
first
church
chapel
well
there
are
worse
absorptions
than
even
these
i
am
not
certain
that
there
was
a
disagreeable
word
or
thought
connected
with
these
queries
and
yet
how
sad
a
thing
to
think
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
is
actually
indebted
to
such
trivialities
for
the
ingathering
of
the
workers
in
his
vineyard
to
consult
with
him
as
to
the
work
alas
alas
many
of
them
were
not
workers
at
all
but
drones
after
all
since
a
higher
motive
could
not
touch
these
people
shall
we
not
be
glad
that
any
motive
so
long
as
it
was
not
actually
a
one
brought
them
within
the
sound
of
prayer
and
praise
they
were
there
anyway
and
the
service
was
commenced
and
the
hymn
that
followed
the
pastor
s
prayer
was
being
sung
when
the
opening
door
revealed
to
the
surprised
gazers
the
forms
of
ruth
erskine
and
judge
burnham
now
judge
burnham
was
one
who
would
on
no
account
have
exerted
himself
to
see
how
dennis
would
appear
or
how
marion
wilbur
would
dress
since
none
of
these
motives
moved
him
the
question
was
what
had
chapter
vi
from
different
standpoints
although
the
first
church
prayer
meeting
had
gone
several
steps
onward
gotten
beyond
the
region
of
distressing
pauses
wherein
the
embarrassed
people
looked
at
each
other
and
wished
something
would
happen
it
was
by
no
means
the
free
social
enjoyable
gathering
that
a
ought
to
be
a
education
of
too
rigid
other
words
false
not
to
be
overcome
in
an
hour
therefore
after
those
who
were
more
accustomed
to
occupying
the
time
had
filled
their
space
there
came
a
lull
not
long
not
distressing
those
chautauqua
girls
were
all
present
and
any
one
of
them
would
have
led
in
a
hymn
rather
than
let
the
pause
stretch
out
but
it
was
long
enough
for
people
to
wonder
whether
the
hour
was
not
almost
gone
and
whether
there
were
any
others
who
would
get
their
lips
open
that
evening
and
then
they
heard
a
strange
voice
clear
steady
as
one
accustomed
to
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
even
in
public
places
and
it
belonged
to
the
stranger
sitting
beside
judge
other
than
his
daughter
susan
the
words
she
uttered
were
these
therefore
being
justified
by
faith
we
have
peace
with
god
through
our
lord
jesus
now
if
it
is
your
fortune
to
be
a
regular
attendant
at
a
where
a
woman
s
voice
is
never
heard
you
can
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
mere
recitation
of
a
bible
verse
by
a
sister
in
the
church
was
a
startling
almost
a
bewildering
innovation
only
a
few
months
before
i
am
not
sure
but
some
of
the
good
people
would
have
been
utterly
overwhelmed
by
such
a
proceeding
but
they
had
received
many
shocks
of
late
the
spirit
of
god
coming
into
their
midst
had
swept
away
many
of
their
former
ideas
and
therefore
they
bore
this
better
but
the
voice
went
on
clear
steady
as
well
sustained
as
though
it
belonged
to
a
deacon
in
the
church
i
have
been
all
day
it
said
dwelling
under
the
shadow
of
that
verse
peace
with
god
it
expresses
much
peace
is
greater
than
joy
or
comfort
or
rest
i
think
the
words
come
to
perplexed
lives
with
such
power
when
we
do
not
see
the
way
clearly
when
we
are
beset
with
difficulties
when
disappointments
thicken
around
us
we
can
still
look
up
to
god
and
say
up
there
where
father
is
it
is
he
sees
the
way
plainly
and
he
will
lead
us
right
through
the
thickets
to
the
sunlight
of
his
eternal
presence
i
felt
this
verse
specially
one
day
something
occurred
in
which
i
had
to
bear
a
prominent
part
for
a
time
i
was
not
sure
what
was
afterward
my
friends
thought
that
i
did
not
make
the
right
decision
and
i
felt
afraid
that
perhaps
i
had
not
and
it
troubled
me
then
i
rested
my
heart
on
this
word
not
because
i
have
done
right
not
because
my
judgment
is
correct
not
because
of
any
act
of
mine
in
any
direction
save
that
one
of
trusting
in
my
lord
justified
by
i
am
so
glad
that
however
much
we
may
disappoint
and
try
our
friends
and
our
own
hearts
in
the
sight
of
the
great
and
wise
and
pure
god
we
are
justified
through
jesus
simple
words
were
these
simply
and
quietly
spoken
the
speaker
had
spent
all
her
life
in
one
place
and
all
her
christian
life
in
one
church
in
that
church
it
had
been
her
custom
to
give
her
word
of
testimony
sometimes
it
was
a
verse
of
a
hymn
that
she
recited
sometimes
it
was
a
text
of
scripture
sometimes
it
was
a
touch
of
her
own
experience
she
had
grown
up
with
the
custom
she
did
not
realize
that
there
were
any
who
had
not
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
to
the
ears
of
the
first
church
people
this
might
be
a
strange
sound
so
there
had
been
no
flutter
or
embarrassment
no
of
any
sort
simply
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
heart
she
had
spoken
the
effect
on
those
about
her
was
obvious
and
various
judge
erskine
s
hand
that
rested
on
the
knob
of
his
cane
trembled
visibly
mrs
senator
seymour
who
sat
behind
him
looked
indignant
and
felt
that
judge
erskine
had
had
enough
to
endure
before
this
but
this
was
really
too
much
marion
wilbur
who
was
present
and
who
wear
her
old
brown
dress
sticking
to
it
to
the
very
last
sat
erect
with
glowing
cheeks
and
eyes
that
were
bright
with
excitement
to
fully
understand
her
excitement
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
about
a
little
conversation
she
had
just
before
starting
for
church
marion
dennis
had
said
as
he
waited
in
the
stuffy
parlor
for
her
to
draw
on
her
gloves
i
wish
you
were
a
very
brave
young
woman
and
liked
innovations
and
were
willing
to
make
a
startling
one
which
you
believe
i
am
not
and
will
not
i
conclude
she
had
replied
laughing
and
stopping
before
him
with
a
mock
bow
added
thank
you
i
believe
you
are
correct
about
part
of
it
at
least
i
certainly
feel
very
meek
and
quiet
whatever
i
may
have
been
in
the
past
what
do
you
want
done
i
want
to
get
rid
of
a
horrible
stiffness
that
is
creeping
over
our
meeting
we
have
been
thawed
but
not
sufficiently
that
marion
the
doesn
t
and
meet
my
ideal
it
is
not
social
and
familiar
enough
i
would
like
to
have
it
a
place
where
we
meet
together
to
talk
over
religious
subjects
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
we
talk
of
other
matters
of
interest
i
would
like
for
instance
to
ask
you
as
to
your
opinion
of
a
passage
of
scripture
or
a
hymn
and
i
should
like
you
to
answer
as
freely
as
you
would
if
we
were
sitting
with
other
friends
parlor
for
the
emphasis
in
this
latter
sentence
brought
a
vivid
blush
to
marion
s
face
and
a
little
exclamation
not
exactly
of
dismay
i
think
are
in
a
very
startling
mood
what
would
your
good
pillars
in
the
church
say
to
such
innovations
do
you
suppose
it
takes
my
breath
away
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
would
almost
as
soon
arise
in
the
desk
and
undertake
to
preach
a
which
is
a
very
different
thing
dennis
said
stoutly
but
now
just
look
at
it
marion
isn
t
that
the
reasonable
way
to
do
imagine
a
party
of
us
meeting
to
discuss
a
prospective
journey
to
europe
or
to
the
holy
land
and
supposing
me
to
be
the
leader
imagine
all
the
ladies
sitting
perfectly
mum
and
the
gentlemen
only
speaking
when
i
called
them
by
name
as
if
instead
of
a
social
meeting
where
all
the
people
were
on
the
same
level
it
was
a
catechetical
class
met
for
examination
with
myself
for
examiner
i
don
t
believe
we
have
the
true
idea
of
perhaps
not
but
if
i
should
suddenly
say
to
you
when
we
are
fairly
seated
in
the
chapel
dr
dennis
what
do
you
think
is
the
meaning
of
the
to
be
what
would
you
think
i
should
be
delighted
and
i
should
proceed
to
answer
you
as
well
as
i
could
and
should
like
to
say
judge
erskine
isn
t
that
your
idea
or
mrs
chester
what
do
you
think
about
it
and
thus
from
one
to
another
freely
familiarly
as
we
would
if
we
were
gathered
to
converse
about
anything
else
that
was
worthy
of
our
attention
that
is
my
idea
of
a
social
well
said
marion
i
don
t
believe
you
will
ever
realize
your
idea
for
myself
i
should
just
as
soon
think
of
attempting
to
fly
the
minute
you
get
seated
behind
that
great
walnut
box
with
those
cushions
towering
before
you
i
feel
as
far
removed
from
you
as
though
miles
of
space
divided
that
is
just
it
dennis
said
growing
eager
i
tell
you
this
sense
of
distance
and
dignity
and
unwise
solemnity
are
all
wrong
the
barriers
ought
to
be
broken
down
how
i
wish
marion
that
you
felt
it
in
your
heart
to
help
me
i
wish
you
would
open
your
mouth
in
that
meeting
it
would
do
you
and
me
and
everybody
good
we
should
have
made
a
beginning
toward
getting
nearer
to
the
people
i
don
t
mean
anything
formidable
you
know
suppose
you
should
just
recite
a
verse
of
appropriate
to
the
subject
before
us
i
don
t
believe
you
have
an
idea
of
the
effect
it
would
oh
yes
i
have
marion
said
with
an
emphatic
nod
of
her
head
can
realize
that
the
effect
would
be
tremendous
i
don
t
believe
have
the
slightest
idea
of
it
what
effect
will
it
have
if
you
and
i
reach
the
meeting
ten
minutes
past
the
time
whereupon
they
went
to
church
of
course
marion
was
interested
in
susan
erskine
s
verse
and
susan
erskine
s
comments
not
so
interested
that
she
felt
moved
to
join
her
and
contribute
of
her
experience
to
that
things
need
thinking
about
and
praying
so
interested
that
her
face
flushed
at
the
thought
that
this
girl
who
was
from
the
country
had
more
moral
courage
than
she
and
was
in
sympathy
with
dennis
advanced
ideas
in
regard
to
as
for
ruth
erskine
her
head
went
down
on
the
seat
before
her
and
she
kept
it
bowed
during
the
remainder
of
the
service
judge
burnham
s
nerves
were
in
turmoil
he
could
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
in
his
life
before
felt
such
sympathy
for
the
trials
of
others
this
particular
form
of
the
trial
seemed
dreadful
to
him
the
idea
that
a
girl
of
ruth
erskine
s
refinement
and
a
man
of
her
father
s
position
should
be
brought
thus
rudely
and
offensively
before
the
public
jarred
upon
him
as
he
had
not
supposed
that
anything
outside
of
himself
and
his
own
trials
could
he
blamed
himself
for
being
the
unwitting
cause
of
part
of
the
trouble
if
he
had
not
suggested
to
ruth
the
possibility
of
coming
to
this
obnoxious
place
she
would
have
been
spared
this
embarrassment
filling
his
mind
with
these
the
exclusion
of
anything
else
that
was
trying
to
determine
how
he
should
best
express
his
sympathy
to
this
tried
girl
by
his
side
he
was
presently
relieved
to
discover
that
the
people
were
rising
for
the
benediction
and
drawn
out
trial
was
over
he
had
not
however
sufficiently
composed
his
thoughts
to
venture
on
any
form
of
address
when
ruth
suddenly
broke
the
silence
in
which
they
were
walking
judge
burnham
i
owe
you
thanks
your
suggestion
about
the
and
your
kind
attendance
upon
me
have
helped
that
meeting
came
to
my
heart
like
balm
i
can
not
venture
to
attempt
telling
you
what
it
has
done
for
me
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
to
make
you
understand
how
heavy
my
heart
was
but
one
sentence
spoken
there
has
been
repeated
to
me
as
a
revelation
i
am
so
glad
to
feel
that
for
there
can
be
peace
with
god
i
have
felt
so
so
bewildered
so
anxious
to
do
right
and
so
sure
that
i
was
doing
wrong
it
has
been
at
times
difficult
for
me
to
determine
right
wrong
and
in
some
things
i
have
felt
so
condemned
that
i
was
miserable
now
i
know
what
i
s
as
only
he
can
as
is
not
interfered
with
by
any
outward
circumstances
to
be
justified
is
surely
enough
i
need
not
ask
for
further
now
indeed
was
judge
burnham
silent
from
very
amazement
here
was
this
girl
to
whom
he
thought
had
come
an
added
and
excessively
embarrassing
trial
thanking
him
for
bringing
her
into
it
and
actually
calling
it
a
help
and
a
joy
he
had
not
the
least
conception
of
what
she
could
mean
a
strong
desire
to
make
her
explain
herself
if
she
could
prompted
his
words
then
you
were
not
disturbed
with
the
lady
s
prominence
this
evening
with
my
sister
s
judge
burnham
you
were
right
in
the
first
whether
ruth
was
willing
to
accept
the
situation
for
herself
or
not
she
could
dignifiedly
insist
upon
others
doing
it
whoever
her
father
introduced
as
his
daughter
should
be
received
by
as
sister
whether
so
received
her
or
not
i
beg
pardon
said
judge
burnham
you
were
not
disturbed
then
by
the
position
which
your
sister
took
i
didn
t
think
anything
about
she
recited
that
bible
verse
most
exquisitely
i
thought
and
the
words
which
she
spoke
afterward
were
strong
and
helpful
they
helped
me
and
i
am
glad
in
my
very
soul
that
i
heard
them
that
is
the
most
that
i
can
tell
you
about
silence
seemed
to
be
the
wisest
course
for
judge
burnham
he
was
thrown
out
of
his
bearings
since
she
did
not
need
comfort
and
refused
to
receive
why
should
he
attempt
to
give
it
but
he
didn
t
in
the
least
understand
her
he
wondered
curiously
whether
his
sympathy
had
been
equally
thrown
away
on
his
friend
judge
erskine
or
whether
he
with
his
refined
and
sensitive
tastes
had
really
received
a
blow
from
which
it
would
be
hard
to
rally
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
probable
this
seemed
as
he
thought
he
waxed
indignant
if
i
were
he
i
would
forbid
her
appearance
in
public
until
she
learns
what
is
due
to
her
position
it
isn
t
likely
that
he
can
rise
to
the
fanatical
heights
where
his
daughter
has
managed
to
climb
probably
she
will
have
made
a
descent
by
morning
i
mean
to
go
in
and
see
the
acting
upon
this
mental
conclusion
he
ascended
the
erskine
steps
and
followed
ruth
without
waiting
for
a
formal
invitation
her
father
had
just
entered
and
was
still
in
the
hall
he
turned
toward
his
friend
come
in
burnham
i
was
very
glad
to
see
you
where
i
did
i
hope
it
will
not
be
the
last
time
i
am
sure
you
must
have
enjoyed
the
meeting
come
to
the
library
and
let
us
talk
it
and
judge
erskine
threw
open
the
library
door
while
the
others
of
his
family
turned
toward
the
parlor
well
he
said
as
the
door
closed
after
them
what
did
you
think
of
the
meeting
i
confess
to
being
considerably
surprised
judge
burnham
answered
truth
to
tell
he
hadn
t
the
least
idea
what
it
would
be
wise
to
say
weren
t
you
said
judge
erskine
with
energy
i
never
was
more
so
i
didn
t
know
she
was
of
that
stamp
and
yet
i
might
have
known
it
she
has
given
me
several
glimpses
of
her
spirit
during
the
little
time
in
which
i
have
known
anything
about
what
are
you
going
to
do
do
how
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
why
i
mean
as
to
the
position
which
she
assumed
oh
as
to
that
there
is
nothing
to
do
i
dare
say
i
may
express
the
gratitude
which
i
feel
for
the
help
that
she
gave
me
but
i
don
t
even
know
whether
i
can
bring
myself
to
do
i
can
t
get
over
the
sense
of
strangeness
and
embarrassment
but
weren
t
those
grand
words
that
she
quoted
i
declare
such
a
truth
as
that
ought
to
take
us
through
anything
it
lifts
me
out
of
myself
for
the
and
i
feel
as
though
i
could
live
my
life
patiently
and
earnestly
i
ll
tell
you
judge
what
i
thought
as
i
sat
in
that
seat
and
looked
over
at
you
i
wished
with
all
my
soul
that
you
might
be
induced
to
look
into
this
matter
for
yourself
and
see
the
reasonableness
of
it
all
did
you
ever
give
it
special
attention
my
friend
in
fact
i
know
you
didn
t
because
a
man
of
your
discernment
could
have
come
to
but
one
conclusion
had
you
thought
closely
about
that
is
a
compliment
to
my
discernment
and
i
appreciate
it
judge
burnham
said
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ever
gave
the
subject
what
you
call
special
and
yet
i
think
i
have
a
reasonable
degree
of
respect
for
religion
and
the
bible
you
have
often
heard
me
express
my
opinion
of
the
literary
merits
of
that
book
i
oh
yes
said
judge
erskine
with
a
little
sigh
literary
merits
yes
i
know
you
respect
the
bible
and
admire
it
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
that
is
very
different
from
living
by
it
i
respected
it
myself
for
forty
years
the
thing
is
to
stand
justified
in
god
s
sight
think
of
that
people
like
you
and
me
who
have
made
mistakes
all
our
that
seem
past
all
yet
in
god
s
sight
they
are
as
if
they
had
not
been
through
the
atoning
blood
isn
t
that
a
glorious
thought
mistakes
are
not
judge
his
friend
added
and
he
spoke
the
words
somewhat
haughtily
in
his
heart
he
added
they
are
a
couple
of
fanatics
he
and
his
daughter
i
don
t
understand
either
of
in
truth
he
was
staggered
it
might
do
to
attribute
fanaticism
or
undue
exaltation
of
mood
to
miss
erskine
possibly
but
he
had
known
the
judge
long
and
well
was
it
likely
that
anything
which
would
not
bear
close
and
logical
looking
into
could
get
possession
of
him
to
a
degree
that
it
to
a
degree
that
was
transforming
his
life
chapter
vii
one
drop
of
oil
now
you
know
that
some
of
you
are
anxious
to
hear
all
about
that
marriage
which
took
place
in
the
first
church
the
next
evening
you
want
to
be
told
how
the
bride
was
dressed
and
whether
she
had
any
bridesmaids
and
whether
dennis
appeared
well
and
how
grace
dennis
was
dressed
and
how
she
acted
and
who
performed
the
ceremony
and
whether
it
was
a
lengthy
one
and
every
little
detail
of
the
whole
matter
also
you
are
desirous
of
knowing
how
the
little
gathering
that
the
erskines
gave
soon
after
was
erskine
became
reconciled
to
the
black
silk
and
the
lace
bow
whether
susan
proved
to
be
yielding
or
obstinate
and
how
ruth
bore
up
under
the
numerous
petty
embarrassments
which
you
plainly
foresee
the
evening
had
in
store
for
her
but
then
there
are
those
discerning
and
sympathetic
all
ready
to
pronounce
on
us
and
say
that
we
are
prolix
and
commonplace
and
tedious
that
we
spend
too
much
time
in
telling
about
trivialities
and
do
not
give
the
startling
points
fast
enough
as
if
that
were
not
exactly
what
we
and
they
are
doing
all
the
time
who
lives
exclamation
points
every
day
there
comes
occasionally
one
into
most
lives
and
assuredly
ruth
erskine
believed
that
hers
had
come
to
her
but
for
the
most
part
lives
are
made
up
of
commas
and
interrogations
and
dashes
there
is
this
comfort
about
professional
that
live
behind
the
scenes
know
that
when
they
are
particularly
hard
on
a
book
one
of
two
things
is
the
they
have
been
touched
in
a
sensitive
spot
by
some
of
the
characters
delineated
or
opinions
expressed
or
else
they
have
an
attack
of
indigestion
and
the
first
subject
that
comes
under
their
must
bear
the
savage
consequences
very
well
let
us
give
them
a
touch
of
the
bride
s
dress
was
a
soft
sheeny
grey
just
the
sort
of
dress
for
enduring
a
long
journey
and
yet
rich
enough
and
soft
enough
and
delicate
enough
to
look
appropriate
in
the
church
as
for
dennis
there
is
this
satisfaction
about
a
man
s
dress
it
is
easy
of
description
when
you
have
said
it
was
black
and
what
is
there
left
to
say
some
gentlemen
look
exceedingly
well
dressed
and
some
look
ungainly
and
every
one
of
them
may
have
on
black
clothes
that
look
to
the
uninitiated
as
though
they
were
what
makes
the
difference
what
lady
can
tell
the
daughter
of
the
house
of
dennis
was
really
the
beauty
of
that
evening
and
if
the
truth
were
known
the
had
expended
more
thought
and
care
upon
the
details
of
this
young
girl
s
attire
than
she
had
on
her
own
eurie
mitchell
and
harrison
were
bridesmaid
and
groomsman
there
were
those
in
the
church
who
wondered
at
that
and
thought
that
harrison
would
have
liked
some
one
better
than
that
mitchell
girl
with
him
under
the
circumstances
but
eurie
herself
and
you
and
i
know
better
we
know
he
has
chosen
her
from
all
others
to
stand
by
him
forever
after
all
i
can
tell
you
nothing
but
the
commonplaces
is
there
ever
anything
else
told
about
weddings
who
is
able
to
put
on
paper
the
and
the
solemnities
of
such
an
hour
it
is
like
all
other
things
in
which
is
told
is
the
least
important
of
all
the
story
old
armington
whose
hair
was
white
with
the
snows
of
more
than
seventy
winters
spoke
the
solemn
words
that
made
them
man
and
wife
for
half
a
century
he
had
been
from
time
to
time
repeating
that
solemn
sentence
you
are
the
two
hundred
and
couple
that
i
have
in
the
name
of
my
master
joined
for
life
god
bless
this
was
his
word
to
and
dennis
as
he
took
their
hands
in
after
greeting
someway
it
made
marion
feel
more
solemn
than
before
two
hundred
and
brides
she
seemed
to
see
the
long
procession
filing
past
she
wondered
where
they
all
were
and
what
had
been
their
later
in
the
evening
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
him
further
how
many
of
the
two
hundred
and
have
you
buried
armington
and
the
old
man
s
lip
trembled
and
his
voice
was
husky
as
he
said
don
t
ask
me
child
a
long
array
of
names
among
them
two
of
my
own
daughters
but
i
shall
sit
down
with
a
great
many
of
them
soon
at
the
marriage
supper
of
the
i
hope
none
of
them
will
wear
starless
and
marion
turned
from
him
quickly
feeling
that
she
had
gotten
her
word
to
live
by
about
that
party
they
lived
through
it
and
in
a
sense
it
was
a
success
there
were
of
course
many
mortifications
but
by
dint
of
shutting
her
eyes
and
her
ears
as
far
as
possible
and
keeping
on
the
alert
in
every
direction
and
remembering
her
recent
resolutions
very
solemnly
renewed
ruth
bore
the
ordeal
reasonably
well
she
had
more
help
than
she
knew
of
susan
erskine
had
inherited
more
of
her
father
s
nature
than
her
mother
s
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
yield
and
she
did
not
enjoy
being
managed
she
could
sacrifice
her
will
or
her
plans
or
her
comfort
if
she
saw
a
for
it
or
if
in
any
sense
the
strong
and
to
her
solemn
word
duty
could
be
put
in
as
a
plea
but
to
be
controlled
in
the
mere
matter
of
her
that
after
she
had
determined
that
to
spend
time
and
money
other
than
was
absolutely
necessary
on
the
adorning
of
the
perishing
body
was
a
moral
something
that
could
not
be
expected
of
her
she
was
not
conscious
of
any
other
feeling
than
that
of
duty
but
in
her
heart
she
was
grieved
not
to
say
insulted
here
had
mother
and
ignored
for
eighteen
years
allowed
to
dress
as
they
pleased
and
go
where
they
pleased
or
not
go
at
all
and
now
that
their
tardy
rights
were
being
in
a
degree
recognized
it
was
the
paltry
question
of
that
must
absorb
them
she
was
willing
to
make
many
concessions
to
ruth
there
were
times
when
she
pitied
her
in
fact
she
had
constant
and
sincere
sympathy
for
her
in
this
invasion
of
home
and
name
she
realized
that
the
blame
was
in
no
sense
ruth
s
and
to
shield
her
as
much
as
possible
from
the
inevitable
suffering
was
susan
s
natural
feeling
but
when
it
came
to
strictly
personal
colors
she
should
wear
and
what
material
and
how
it
should
be
made
rebelled
surely
those
were
matters
which
she
had
a
right
to
decide
for
herself
mother
might
be
easily
managed
if
she
would
perhaps
it
was
well
that
she
could
be
but
for
herself
susan
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
and
hoped
most
earnestly
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
in
that
direction
as
for
ruth
she
thought
of
the
matter
in
a
troubled
way
and
shrank
from
entering
into
detail
the
most
she
had
done
was
to
ask
hesitatingly
what
wear
on
the
evening
in
question
and
susan
had
answered
her
coldly
that
she
had
not
given
the
matter
a
thought
as
she
supposed
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
about
that
when
the
hour
for
dressing
arrived
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
she
had
but
one
thing
to
wear
and
ruth
knew
it
too
and
knew
that
it
was
and
and
in
every
way
inappropriate
yet
she
actually
turned
away
feeling
unable
to
cope
with
the
coldness
and
the
evident
reserve
of
this
young
woman
over
whom
she
could
not
hope
to
have
influence
curiously
enough
it
was
gentle
little
flossy
who
stepped
into
these
troubled
waters
and
poured
her
noiseless
drop
of
oil
she
came
in
the
morning
waiting
for
ruth
to
go
with
her
to
make
a
farewell
call
on
marion
wilbur
the
morning
before
the
wedding
and
in
the
library
among
the
plants
giving
them
loving
little
touches
here
and
there
was
susan
what
is
marion
to
wear
for
travelling
do
you
know
flossy
had
asked
of
ruth
as
some
word
about
the
journey
suggested
the
thought
and
ruth
had
answered
briefly
almost
savagely
i
don
t
know
it
is
a
blessed
thing
that
no
one
will
have
to
give
it
a
thought
marion
will
be
sure
to
choose
the
most
appropriate
thing
and
to
have
every
detail
in
exquisite
keeping
with
it
it
is
only
lately
that
i
have
realized
what
a
gift
she
had
in
that
then
ruth
had
gone
away
to
make
ready
and
wise
little
flossy
looking
after
her
with
the
thoughtful
look
in
her
soft
eyes
began
to
see
one
of
her
annoyances
plainly
and
to
wonder
if
there
were
any
way
of
helping
then
she
went
down
the
long
room
to
susan
busy
among
the
plants
how
pretty
they
are
she
said
sweetly
what
gorgeous
coloring
and
delicate
tracery
in
the
leaves
does
it
ever
occur
to
you
to
wonder
that
such
great
skill
should
have
been
expended
in
just
making
them
look
pretty
to
please
our
eyes
no
said
susan
earnest
and
honest
i
don
t
think
i
ever
thought
of
i
do
often
just
think
of
that
ivy
it
would
have
grown
as
rapidly
and
been
quite
as
healthy
if
the
leaves
had
been
square
and
all
of
them
an
intense
green
instead
of
being
shaded
into
that
lovely
dark
scolloped
border
all
around
the
outer
edge
he
has
made
every
thing
beautiful
in
his
i
found
that
verse
one
day
last
week
and
i
liked
it
since
then
i
seem
to
be
noticing
everybody
and
everything
to
see
whether
the
beauty
remains
i
find
it
all
this
was
wonderfully
new
to
susan
erskine
she
was
silent
and
thoughtful
presently
she
said
it
doesn
t
apply
to
human
least
to
many
it
doesn
t
i
know
good
men
and
women
who
are
not
beautiful
at
wouldn
t
that
depend
a
little
on
what
one
meant
by
beauty
flossy
said
timidly
argument
was
not
her
forte
and
then
you
know
he
the
plants
and
their
beauty
for
them
i
mean
because
they
are
soulless
think
he
left
to
us
who
are
immortal
a
great
deal
of
the
fashioning
to
do
for
oh
of
course
there
is
a
moral
beauty
which
we
find
in
the
faces
of
the
most
ordinary
but
i
was
speaking
of
physical
so
was
i
said
flossy
with
an
emphatic
nod
of
her
pretty
little
head
i
didn
t
mean
anything
deep
and
wise
at
all
i
don
t
know
anything
about
what
they
call
esthetics
or
any
of
those
scientific
phrases
i
mean
just
pretty
things
now
to
show
you
how
simple
my
thought
was
that
ivy
leaf
made
me
think
of
a
pretty
dress
well
made
and
shapely
you
know
and
fitted
to
the
face
and
form
of
the
wearer
i
thought
the
one
who
made
such
lovely
plants
and
finished
them
so
exquisitely
must
be
pleased
to
see
us
study
enough
of
his
works
to
make
ourselves
look
pleasing
to
the
eyes
of
susan
erskine
turned
quite
away
from
the
plants
and
stared
at
her
guest
with
wide
open
amazed
eyes
for
a
full
minute
don
t
you
think
she
asked
at
last
and
her
tone
was
of
that
stamp
which
indicates
suppressed
don
t
you
think
that
a
great
deal
of
time
and
a
great
deal
of
money
and
a
great
deal
of
force
which
might
do
wonders
elsewhere
are
wasted
on
dress
yes
said
flossy
simply
and
sweetly
i
know
that
is
so
after
i
was
converted
for
a
little
while
it
troubled
me
very
much
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
not
a
little
money
in
that
way
and
i
knew
it
must
be
wrong
and
i
was
greatly
in
danger
of
going
to
the
other
extreme
i
think
for
a
few
days
i
made
myself
positively
ugly
to
my
father
and
mother
by
the
unbecoming
way
in
which
i
thought
i
ought
to
dress
but
after
awhile
it
came
to
me
that
it
really
took
very
little
more
time
to
look
than
it
did
to
look
and
that
if
certain
colors
became
the
form
and
complexion
that
god
had
given
me
and
certain
others
did
not
there
could
be
no
religion
in
wearing
those
not
fitted
to
me
god
made
them
all
and
he
must
have
meant
some
of
them
specially
for
me
just
as
he
specially
thought
about
me
in
other
matters
oh
i
haven
t
gone
into
the
question
very
deeply
i
want
to
understand
it
better
i
am
going
to
ask
roberts
about
it
the
very
next
time
he
comes
but
meantime
i
feel
sure
that
the
lord
jesus
wants
me
to
please
my
parents
and
my
sister
in
every
reasonable
way
sister
kitty
is
really
uncomfortable
if
colors
don
t
assimilate
and
what
right
have
i
to
make
her
uncomfortable
so
long
as
the
very
rose
leaves
are
tinted
with
just
the
color
of
all
others
that
seemed
fitted
to
them
susan
mused
what
would
you
do
she
asked
presently
if
you
had
been
made
with
that
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
left
out
i
mean
suppose
you
hadn
t
the
least
idea
whether
you
ought
to
wear
green
or
yellow
or
what
some
people
are
so
constituted
that
they
don
t
know
what
you
mean
when
you
tell
them
that
certain
colors
don
t
assimilate
what
are
to
do
yes
said
flossy
gently
and
sweetly
i
know
what
you
mean
because
people
are
made
very
differently
about
these
things
i
am
trying
to
learn
how
to
make
bread
i
don
t
know
in
the
least
i
can
make
cake
and
desserts
and
all
those
things
but
roberts
likes
the
bread
that
our
cook
makes
and
as
i
don
t
know
how
to
make
that
kind
nor
any
other
i
thought
i
ought
to
learn
it
isn
t
a
bit
natural
to
me
i
have
to
be
very
particular
to
remember
all
the
tiresome
things
about
it
i
hadn
t
an
idea
there
were
so
many
and
i
say
to
the
cook
now
katy
what
am
i
to
do
next
this
doesn
t
look
right
at
and
she
comes
and
looks
over
my
shoulder
and
says
why
child
you
need
more
flour
always
put
in
flour
till
you
get
rid
of
that
dreadful
then
i
say
to
myself
that
dreadful
stickiness
is
to
be
gotten
rid
of
and
flour
will
rid
me
of
it
it
seems
and
i
determine
in
my
own
mind
that
i
will
remember
that
item
for
future
use
i
don
t
really
like
the
work
at
all
it
almost
seems
as
though
bread
ought
to
be
made
without
such
an
expenditure
of
time
and
strength
but
it
isn
t
you
know
and
so
i
try
and
when
i
think
of
how
roberts
likes
it
i
feel
glad
that
i
am
taking
time
and
pains
to
learn
you
know
there
are
so
many
things
to
remember
about
it
from
the
first
spoonful
of
yeast
down
to
the
dampening
of
the
crust
and
tucking
up
the
loaves
when
they
come
out
of
the
oven
that
it
really
takes
a
good
deal
of
memory
i
asked
roberts
once
if
he
thought
there
would
be
any
impropriety
in
my
asking
for
ability
to
take
in
all
the
details
that
i
was
trying
to
learn
he
laughed
at
me
a
often
he
said
there
could
be
no
impropriety
in
praying
about
anything
that
it
was
proper
to
thank
you
said
susan
erskine
promptly
then
she
did
what
was
an
unusual
thing
for
her
to
do
she
came
over
to
the
daintily
dressed
little
blossom
on
the
sofa
and
bending
her
tall
form
kissed
the
delicately
flushed
cheek
lightly
and
tenderly
ruth
said
little
flossy
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
i
think
i
like
your
new
sister
very
much
indeed
i
am
not
sure
but
she
is
going
to
be
a
splendid
woman
i
think
she
has
it
in
her
to
be
grandly
when
did
you
become
such
a
discerner
of
character
little
girlie
was
ruth
s
answer
but
she
felt
grateful
to
flossy
the
words
had
helped
her
as
for
susan
she
went
back
to
the
plants
and
hovered
over
them
quite
as
lovingly
but
more
thoughtfully
than
before
she
studied
the
leaves
and
blossoms
all
the
while
with
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
this
small
girl
who
had
looked
to
the
susan
like
a
carefully
prepared
edition
of
a
late
had
given
her
some
entirely
new
ideas
in
regard
to
this
question
of
dress
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
side
to
it
that
she
had
not
canvassed
what
right
have
i
to
make
her
uncomfortable
gentle
flossy
had
asked
speaking
of
her
sister
kitty
susan
repeated
the
sentence
to
herself
substituting
ruth
s
name
for
kitty
s
presently
she
went
to
her
own
room
ruth
she
said
later
in
the
day
when
they
were
for
a
moment
alone
together
would
you
like
to
have
me
get
a
new
dress
for
the
was
a
new
name
for
the
social
gathering
but
it
was
what
susan
had
heard
such
gatherings
called
ruth
hesitated
looked
at
the
questioner
doubtfully
a
moment
then
realizing
that
here
was
one
with
whom
she
could
be
straightforward
said
frankly
yes
i
would
very
what
would
you
like
me
to
get
i
think
you
would
look
well
in
one
of
those
dark
greens
that
are
almost
like
an
in
tint
do
you
know
what
i
mean
susan
laughed
she
did
not
take
in
the
question
she
was
thinking
that
it
was
a
singular
and
a
rather
pleasant
coincidence
that
she
should
be
advised
to
dress
after
the
fashion
of
the
which
had
served
for
illustration
in
the
morning
i
don
t
suppose
i
ever
looked
well
in
my
life
she
said
at
last
smiling
brightly
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
try
the
sensation
if
you
will
be
so
kind
i
should
like
you
to
select
and
purchase
a
dress
for
me
that
shall
be
according
to
your
taste
only
remembering
that
i
dress
as
plainly
as
is
consistent
with
circumstances
from
when
she
was
alone
again
she
said
with
an
amused
smile
curving
her
lip
i
must
get
rid
of
that
dreadful
stickiness
and
flour
will
do
it
that
is
what
the
dear
little
thing
said
dark
green
will
do
it
for
me
it
seems
if
i
find
that
to
be
the
case
i
must
remember
ruth
dressed
for
shopping
with
a
relieved
heart
she
was
one
of
those
to
whom
shopping
was
an
artistic
pleasure
besides
she
had
never
had
anyone
save
herself
on
which
to
exhibit
taste
she
was
not
sure
that
it
would
be
at
all
disagreeable
she
begins
to
comprehend
the
necessities
of
the
position
a
little
i
believe
she
said
meaning
susan
and
didn
t
know
that
flossy
shipley
s
gentle
little
voice
and
carefully
chosen
words
had
laid
down
a
solid
plank
of
for
her
uncompromising
sister
to
tread
upon
chapter
viii
finding
one
s
calling
during
the
days
which
preceded
that
social
gathering
ruth
found
her
mind
often
busy
with
the
wonders
of
the
verse
which
had
been
quoted
at
she
recognized
it
as
from
the
chapter
which
she
had
read
in
the
morning
and
she
it
filled
with
a
new
sense
of
its
meaning
she
sought
after
and
earnestly
desired
to
realize
peace
with
god
how
wonderful
would
it
be
to
be
able
to
say
and
not
only
so
but
we
glory
in
tribulation
poor
ruth
believed
that
she
understood
the
meaning
of
that
word
would
it
be
possible
for
her
ever
to
glory
in
it
as
she
read
those
verses
and
thought
about
them
she
seemed
to
hear
again
the
peculiar
ring
of
triumph
that
there
was
in
susan
s
voice
as
she
repeated
the
words
feels
ruth
said
to
herself
i
believe
she
knows
more
about
these
things
than
i
do
i
wonder
how
she
came
to
get
the
thought
in
the
first
place
i
read
the
verse
and
didn
t
take
it
in
perhaps
she
has
taken
in
other
things
about
which
i
know
nothing
and
which
would
help
me
thinking
these
thoughts
dwelling
on
them
they
culminated
in
a
sudden
resolution
which
led
her
to
tap
at
the
door
of
susan
s
room
she
was
cordially
invited
to
enter
susan
was
engaged
in
dusting
the
row
of
books
in
dull
and
somewhat
shabby
binding
that
ornamented
the
pretty
table
under
the
gaslight
have
a
seat
she
said
i
can
t
think
how
the
dust
gets
at
my
books
so
often
i
put
them
in
order
this
morning
they
are
my
good
old
friends
and
i
like
to
take
special
care
of
them
but
they
are
she
fingered
the
bindings
with
loving
hands
and
ruth
curious
to
see
what
they
were
drew
near
enough
to
read
some
of
the
titles
cruden
s
concordance
a
bible
barnes
notes
on
the
gospels
and
bushnell
s
moral
uses
of
dark
the
others
were
old
and
some
of
them
obsolete
school
i
haven
t
many
susan
said
in
a
tender
tone
but
they
are
very
useful
they
have
been
my
best
friends
for
so
long
that
i
think
i
should
be
a
real
mourner
over
the
loss
of
one
of
the
new
dress
lay
on
the
bed
and
some
soft
rare
laces
a
gift
to
susan
that
day
from
her
father
lay
beside
it
ruth
glanced
that
way
have
you
tried
on
the
dress
since
it
was
finished
no
i
thought
it
would
be
time
enough
in
the
morning
and
i
had
a
little
reading
that
i
was
anxious
to
do
this
what
are
you
reading
something
that
you
like
yes
very
much
susan
said
with
a
rare
smile
lighting
her
pale
face
i
only
began
it
the
other
night
i
didn
t
know
it
was
so
rich
it
is
the
first
chapter
of
colossians
but
i
only
read
to
the
fifth
ruth
looked
her
amazement
why
you
must
have
been
interrupted
very
susan
shook
her
head
no
on
the
contrary
i
spent
very
nearly
an
hour
over
those
four
verses
the
longer
i
studied
on
them
the
more
remarkable
they
became
and
i
found
myself
is
the
meaning
so
very
obscure
not
at
all
the
meaning
is
there
on
the
surface
the
only
thing
is
there
is
so
much
and
it
leads
one
s
thoughts
in
so
many
different
ways
do
you
remember
the
second
verse
i
don
t
remember
it
at
all
very
likely
i
never
read
well
the
second
verse
is
addressed
to
the
saints
and
faithful
brethren
in
christ
which
are
at
that
sentence
arrested
my
thoughts
completely
suppose
i
had
been
living
at
colosse
in
those
days
could
i
have
claimed
that
letter
to
the
i
stopped
over
the
word
and
wondered
over
it
and
queried
just
what
it
meant
and
it
meant
so
much
that
i
should
really
have
gotten
no
farther
than
that
sentence
if
i
had
not
deliberately
left
it
and
gone
on
to
the
grace
be
unto
you
and
i
found
my
heart
craving
peace
i
think
i
was
somewhat
like
the
child
who
claims
the
reward
or
reaches
out
after
it
without
waiting
to
be
sure
whether
he
has
met
the
but
i
don
t
understand
you
very
well
what
about
saints
they
were
holy
men
were
they
not
set
apart
for
special
work
at
that
special
time
how
their
experience
touch
yours
i
don
t
think
so
i
think
they
were
just
men
and
women
who
loved
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
were
called
by
his
name
just
as
you
and
i
but
are
not
saints
at
least
i
am
but
you
are
called
to
be
i
don
t
understand
you
think
of
that
verse
of
paul
s
unto
the
church
of
god
which
is
at
corinth
to
them
that
are
sanctified
in
christ
jesus
to
be
now
you
know
are
sanctified
in
christ
jesus
so
are
we
not
called
to
be
saints
i
don
t
know
what
sanctified
means
very
well
and
besides
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
the
letter
was
written
to
the
church
at
corinth
don
t
live
in
corinth
how
do
i
know
that
the
address
fits
me
if
i
should
find
a
letter
addressed
to
the
people
who
live
on
street
wouldn
t
i
be
likely
to
say
well
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
i
live
on
fifth
avenue
ah
but
suppose
the
very
next
sentence
read
and
to
all
that
love
the
lord
jesus
christ
wouldn
t
you
claim
the
letter
yes
said
ruth
with
a
flash
of
joy
in
her
face
i
think
i
well
don
t
you
know
the
next
words
are
with
all
that
in
every
place
call
upon
the
name
of
jesus
christ
our
lord
both
theirs
and
i
never
thought
of
it
said
ruth
then
after
a
little
did
you
find
out
what
a
saint
was
why
i
found
some
characteristics
of
them
and
tried
to
see
if
they
answered
my
description
have
you
ever
looked
the
matter
up
no
said
ruth
i
did
not
so
much
as
know
that
i
was
expected
to
be
a
saint
tell
me
what
you
why
said
susan
drawing
her
chair
and
opening
her
bible
see
here
i
found
a
promise
he
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
it
made
me
all
the
more
eager
to
learn
as
to
my
claim
was
i
his
saint
would
he
keep
me
in
that
same
verse
there
is
a
contrast
he
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
saints
and
the
wicked
shall
be
silent
in
now
if
there
are
only
two
classes
of
people
saints
and
the
wicked
which
am
i
in
god
s
sight
who
are
the
wicked
i
looked
for
a
description
of
them
and
found
this
statement
the
lord
preserveth
all
them
that
love
him
but
all
the
wicked
will
he
now
i
i
love
the
lord
and
i
know
that
he
will
not
destroy
me
for
i
have
in
my
heart
the
assurance
of
his
promise
if
that
is
so
must
be
one
of
his
saints
then
i
found
the
promise
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
keep
who
and
looking
back
a
little
i
found
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
but
he
promises
to
keep
only
those
who
are
then
i
found
the
promise
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
now
i
said
if
there
is
no
one
interceding
between
a
just
god
and
me
what
will
become
of
me
but
i
found
the
inspired
statement
of
paul
wherefore
he
is
able
to
save
them
to
the
uttermost
that
come
unto
god
by
him
seeing
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
that
puts
me
at
once
among
those
for
whom
he
intercedes
and
his
special
work
in
heaven
is
to
make
intercession
for
the
saints
by
this
time
i
was
ready
to
claim
the
name
and
you
may
know
i
was
anxious
to
find
what
it
meant
i
went
to
the
dictionary
the
first
definition
i
found
was
a
person
that
startled
me
could
it
be
that
i
was
sanctified
why
i
feel
so
sinful
and
so
weak
and
so
small
well
i
said
what
does
sanctified
mean
and
i
found
that
it
was
defined
as
set
apart
to
a
holy
or
religious
use
it
recalled
to
my
mind
the
statement
of
paul
but
ye
are
washed
but
ye
are
sanctified
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
the
lord
a
great
deal
ought
to
be
expected
of
us
after
ruth
drew
a
long
sigh
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
i
believe
she
said
sadly
i
never
read
the
bible
in
that
way
half
the
time
it
doesn
t
seem
to
have
anything
in
it
really
for
don
t
you
think
that
some
of
our
trouble
is
in
being
content
with
simply
not
the
bible
i
thought
the
other
night
that
if
i
had
spent
an
hour
on
geometry
and
then
begun
to
understand
it
somewhat
i
should
feel
as
though
i
were
repaid
but
sometimes
i
read
a
bible
verse
over
two
or
three
times
and
then
because
its
meaning
is
obscure
i
feel
half
discouraged
i
was
speaking
of
it
father
last
evening
and
he
said
he
thought
the
trouble
was
largely
in
that
susan
had
not
yet
gotten
so
that
she
could
speak
the
unfamiliar
name
without
hesitation
as
for
ruth
her
brow
clouded
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
she
could
ever
share
that
name
with
anyone
but
she
was
deeply
the
train
of
thought
which
had
been
started
what
next
she
asked
curious
to
see
whither
susan
s
thoughts
had
led
her
you
said
you
read
no
farther
than
the
fourth
verse
what
stopped
you
there
i
don
t
see
much
in
it
and
she
leaned
forward
and
the
verse
from
susan
s
open
bible
oh
why
you
since
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
jesus
and
of
the
love
which
ye
have
to
all
the
that
verse
stopped
me
longer
than
any
other
especially
the
sentence
since
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
jesus
is
such
a
common
form
of
expression
i
thought
of
it
last
evening
while
listening
to
the
talk
in
the
parlor
i
heard
that
the
wheelers
were
going
abroad
some
one
said
and
another
i
heard
that
thomas
was
soon
to
bring
a
wife
two
of
the
young
ladies
talked
in
low
tones
and
nearly
all
i
could
catch
was
the
expression
i
heard
he
was
or
she
was
or
they
it
was
evident
that
a
great
deal
had
been
heard
about
a
great
many
people
i
said
over
the
verse
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
who
hears
of
such
things
how
many
people
have
such
marked
and
abiding
faith
in
christ
jesus
that
when
we
talk
of
them
we
say
i
heard
that
miss
so
and
so
had
the
most
implicit
faith
in
the
power
of
christ
to
keep
now
wouldn
t
that
be
a
strange
thing
to
say
i
should
think
it
would
said
ruth
amazed
at
this
train
of
thought
after
all
i
suppose
many
people
have
the
only
it
is
not
the
custom
in
society
to
talk
about
such
i
don
t
answered
susan
positively
of
course
many
people
have
it
in
a
degree
but
not
to
such
an
extent
that
it
arouses
interest
and
excites
remark
i
think
it
is
the
custom
in
society
to
talk
about
that
which
interests
has
been
suggested
to
their
minds
by
passing
events
i
have
heard
that
it
is
a
very
common
thing
in
localities
where
moody
has
been
holding
meetings
to
discuss
his
remarkable
faith
and
love
don
t
you
suppose
if
my
christian
life
were
so
marked
a
force
that
all
who
came
in
contact
with
me
felt
its
influence
it
would
be
natural
to
speak
of
it
when
my
friends
chanced
to
mention
my
name
i
suppose
so
ruth
said
slowly
at
least
i
don
t
see
why
it
should
not
be
and
indeed
it
is
very
common
for
people
to
talk
about
the
change
in
flossy
susan
s
voice
was
very
earnest
i
wish
i
could
bear
such
testimony
as
that
i
believe
it
would
be
right
to
be
ambitious
in
that
direction
to
live
so
that
when
people
spoke
of
me
at
all
the
most
marked
thing
they
could
say
about
me
would
be
not
how
i
dressed
or
appeared
or
talked
but
how
strong
my
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
was
and
how
it
colored
all
my
words
and
acts
wouldn
t
that
be
a
grand
ambition
and
of
the
love
which
ye
have
to
all
the
saints
ruth
repeated
half
aloud
half
to
herself
her
eye
had
caught
the
words
again
suddenly
she
started
and
the
blood
flowed
in
ready
waves
into
her
cheeks
she
had
caught
a
new
and
personal
meaning
to
the
love
to
the
suppose
this
usurper
of
home
and
name
who
sat
near
objectionable
were
one
of
the
saints
i
verily
believe
she
is
ruth
said
to
her
beating
would
it
be
possible
so
to
live
that
people
would
ever
say
she
loves
that
sister
of
hers
because
she
recognizes
in
her
one
of
the
lord
s
own
saints
nothing
looked
less
probable
than
this
she
could
not
bring
her
heart
to
feel
that
she
could
love
her
a
sort
of
kindly
interest
she
might
grow
to
feel
an
endurance
that
would
become
passive
and
in
a
sense
tolerable
but
could
she
ever
help
paling
or
flushing
when
she
heard
this
new
voice
say
father
and
realized
that
she
had
a
right
to
the
name
even
as
she
herself
had
she
had
been
the
only
miss
erskine
so
long
and
she
had
been
so
proud
of
the
old
aristocratic
name
and
she
had
felt
so
deeply
the
blot
upon
its
honor
that
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
never
come
to
look
with
anything
like
upon
one
connected
with
the
bitterness
yet
it
did
flash
over
her
with
a
strange
new
sense
of
power
that
susan
erskine
held
nearer
relation
to
her
than
even
these
human
ties
if
was
indeed
a
daughter
of
the
most
high
if
the
lord
jesus
christ
was
her
elder
brother
then
was
this
girl
her
sister
a
daughter
of
royal
blood
and
almost
believed
high
position
up
there
where
souls
are
looked
at
instead
of
bodies
a
dozen
times
during
the
evening
which
followed
this
conversation
did
the
words
of
this
bible
verse
and
the
thoughts
connected
there
with
flash
over
ruth
it
was
the
evening
of
the
social
gathering
now
that
susan
had
called
her
attention
to
it
she
was
astonished
over
the
number
of
times
that
those
words
i
heard
were
on
people
s
lips
they
had
heard
of
contemplated
journeys
and
changes
in
business
and
changes
in
name
and
reverses
and
good
fortunes
and
contemplated
arrangements
for
amusement
or
entertainment
or
instruction
they
had
heard
about
their
friends
or
their
acquaintances
yet
no
one
said
during
the
whole
far
as
she
they
had
heard
anything
very
marked
about
the
religious
life
of
anyone
in
fact
religious
life
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
not
talked
of
at
all
so
ruth
thought
if
she
had
stood
near
judge
burnham
and
her
sister
at
one
time
she
would
have
heard
him
saying
he
is
a
man
of
mark
in
town
one
prominent
on
every
good
occasion
noted
for
his
philanthropy
and
generosity
and
is
one
of
the
few
men
whom
everybody
seems
to
trust
without
ever
having
their
confidence
jarred
i
have
heard
it
said
that
his
word
would
be
taken
in
any
business
transaction
as
quickly
as
his
bond
would
is
he
a
christian
man
susan
had
asked
and
a
look
had
shadowed
judge
burnham
s
face
as
he
answered
as
to
that
i
really
don
t
know
i
have
never
heard
that
he
made
any
professions
in
that
direction
though
it
is
possible
that
he
may
be
connected
with
some
church
why
miss
erskine
do
you
think
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
honest
and
honorable
and
philanthropic
unless
he
has
made
some
profession
of
it
in
a
church
then
susan
had
looked
at
the
questioner
steadily
and
thoughtfully
a
moment
before
she
answered
i
was
not
thinking
of
possible
morality
i
was
simply
wondering
whether
the
man
who
was
building
so
fair
and
strong
a
house
had
looked
to
it
that
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock
or
whether
he
really
were
so
strangely
improvident
as
to
build
upon
the
sand
you
know
think
that
other
foundation
can
no
man
lay
than
that
which
is
laid
jesus
christ
being
the
chief
so
there
was
some
religious
conversation
at
the
erskines
party
and
it
sent
judge
burnham
home
thinking
and
now
though
the
fruits
of
that
evening
s
gathering
will
go
on
growing
and
ripening
and
being
gathered
in
from
human
lives
so
far
as
we
personally
are
concerned
we
are
done
with
that
party
chapter
ix
a
society
cross
the
next
thing
that
occurred
to
mar
the
peace
of
this
young
went
out
calling
with
her
this
duty
was
passed
over
just
as
long
as
it
would
do
to
ignore
the
claims
of
society
she
being
finally
driven
to
it
by
realizing
that
more
talk
was
being
made
by
going
than
would
be
likely
to
result
from
going
then
with
foreboding
heart
she
made
ready
she
planned
at
first
to
escape
it
all
and
have
her
father
the
victim
but
there
were
two
difficulties
he
had
rarely
made
other
than
professional
calls
or
most
ceremonious
ones
on
persons
high
in
the
profession
and
therefore
this
whole
matter
would
be
so
new
to
him
that
to
tide
the
bewildered
wife
through
it
would
be
impossible
and
besides
ruth
felt
the
necessity
of
being
present
to
know
the
very
worst
that
could
be
said
or
done
and
to
attempt
going
as
a
trio
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
there
was
one
bright
spot
in
her
annoyances
it
was
pleasant
to
remember
the
look
of
relief
which
gleamed
over
her
father
s
face
when
she
told
him
he
could
be
excused
from
attendance
on
them
if
he
chose
i
can
save
him
so
much
at
least
she
told
herself
and
it
helped
her
to
make
ready
if
she
would
keep
perfectly
quiet
she
murmured
again
to
herself
as
she
waited
at
the
door
of
her
mother
s
room
for
the
last
glove
to
be
drawn
on
and
marked
what
an
effect
the
rich
black
silk
with
its
perfect
fitting
seams
and
perfectly
draped
folds
had
on
the
dumpy
figure
if
she
only
get
along
without
talking
she
would
do
very
great
attention
had
been
paid
by
ruth
to
the
details
of
this
toilet
the
soft
laces
at
throat
and
wrist
the
rich
mantle
the
shapely
hat
with
the
unmistakable
air
of
style
about
it
even
to
the
gloves
of
exactly
the
right
shade
and
size
had
each
been
objects
of
separate
study
and
erskine
though
occasionally
she
had
fond
memories
of
the
green
silk
dress
and
the
red
she
began
to
be
dimly
conscious
were
never
destined
to
shine
took
in
so
much
of
the
general
effect
as
filled
her
with
surprise
and
reconciled
her
to
the
position
of
lay
figure
in
ruth
s
hands
looking
upon
her
with
the
same
degree
of
surprised
awe
that
a
statue
might
could
it
be
gifted
with
life
and
behold
itself
getting
draped
for
the
tableau
the
calls
started
nicely
flossy
shipley
s
being
the
first
home
at
which
they
halted
flossy
in
her
sweet
winning
indescribable
way
decoyed
erskine
into
a
corner
easy
chair
and
engaged
her
in
earnest
even
absorbed
conversation
while
ruth
tried
to
unbend
from
her
dignity
and
chat
with
flossy
s
cheery
social
mother
glancing
from
time
to
time
toward
the
elder
woman
and
the
fair
young
girl
and
noting
the
fact
that
both
were
unmistakably
interested
in
their
subject
for
conversation
ruth
found
herself
wondering
what
it
be
whatever
it
was
she
was
grateful
and
gave
flossy
a
most
informal
and
tender
kiss
at
parting
by
way
of
expressing
her
relief
then
too
and
dennis
were
at
home
and
were
joyfully
glad
to
see
them
and
dennis
held
erskine
s
attention
leaving
ruth
free
to
talk
with
and
look
at
and
wonder
over
marion
she
seemed
so
fresh
and
bright
and
glad
full
of
eagerness
full
of
plans
full
of
heartiness
for
any
and
everything
that
might
be
mentioned
she
is
at
least
ten
years
younger
than
i
ever
knew
her
to
be
was
ruth
s
mental
conclusion
as
she
watched
the
expressive
face
there
was
no
restraint
in
their
talk
ruth
felt
that
for
the
she
could
throw
off
the
burden
of
responsibility
and
have
a
good
time
she
did
not
know
what
dennis
was
saying
to
her
and
she
did
not
care
it
was
so
pleasant
to
feel
that
she
could
trust
him
that
he
was
a
friend
and
would
neither
repeat
to
others
the
mistakes
of
the
uncultured
woman
with
whom
he
talked
nor
laugh
about
them
with
marion
when
she
was
gone
ruth
not
only
respected
and
liked
but
thoroughly
trusted
her
pastor
i
am
glad
she
married
him
she
told
herself
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
and
feeling
rather
than
noticing
that
they
were
both
evidently
heartily
glad
about
the
same
thing
they
are
just
exactly
suited
to
each
other
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
for
them
both
what
a
blessed
change
the
brightness
of
this
room
must
be
when
she
compares
it
with
that
little
den
of
hers
up
the
third
flight
of
stairs
yes
and
there
was
another
side
to
that
what
a
nameless
charm
as
of
home
she
had
thrown
over
the
propriety
of
the
parsonage
parlor
before
it
had
been
a
and
proper
and
for
as
became
the
parsonage
it
was
presently
too
came
gracie
with
her
beautiful
face
and
gracious
manner
free
and
cordial
and
at
ease
mamma
she
said
as
naturally
as
though
it
had
been
a
name
constantly
on
her
lips
and
indeed
it
was
plain
that
she
enjoyed
the
name
there
were
no
sad
contrasts
to
dim
her
eyes
or
quicken
the
beatings
of
her
heart
the
real
mother
having
only
had
time
to
give
her
darling
one
clinging
kiss
before
god
called
her
home
she
may
well
be
proud
of
such
a
mother
as
her
father
has
brought
to
ruth
thought
looking
from
one
to
the
other
and
noting
the
glance
of
sympathy
which
passed
between
them
and
then
she
sighed
being
drawn
back
to
her
heavier
lot
marion
s
dreary
life
had
blossomed
into
brightness
while
all
that
was
ever
bright
had
gone
out
of
hers
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
her
then
she
arose
realizing
that
nothing
of
this
afternoon
s
crosses
would
be
borne
if
she
whiled
the
time
on
flossy
shipley
and
marion
dennis
from
the
moment
that
the
two
were
seated
in
schuyler
colman
s
parlor
peace
left
ruth
s
heart
here
was
responsibility
solemn
and
to
tide
this
uncultured
woman
through
the
shoals
and
breakers
of
this
aristocratic
atmosphere
no
sooner
was
erskine
fairly
seated
than
she
broke
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
with
the
exclamation
why
my
patience
if
there
isn
t
mason
kent
staring
right
straight
at
me
what
a
splendid
likeness
i
declare
i
most
feel
as
though
he
ought
to
speak
to
was
kent
an
acquaintance
of
yours
nothing
could
be
colder
more
lofty
more
in
keeping
with
the
proprieties
than
the
tone
in
which
schuyler
colman
asked
the
question
an
acquaintance
why
i
guess
he
was
i
sewed
in
his
house
nigh
on
two
months
before
his
oldest
daughter
was
married
they
had
a
regular
seamstress
in
the
house
one
who
belonged
to
the
family
you
know
o
they
were
high
up
in
the
world
i
tell
you
but
she
needed
extra
help
when
the
rush
came
and
there
was
always
lots
of
plain
sewing
to
do
anyway
and
the
woman
i
sewed
for
last
recommended
me
and
i
got
in
it
was
a
nice
place
they
gave
good
pay
better
than
i
ever
got
anywhere
else
and
i
always
remembered
kent
he
was
as
kind
as
he
could
shall
i
try
to
describe
to
you
the
glow
on
ruth
erskine
s
face
what
had
become
of
her
haughty
indifference
to
other
people
s
opinions
what
had
become
of
her
loftily
expressed
scorn
of
persons
who
indulged
in
pride
of
station
or
pride
of
birth
ah
little
this
young
woman
knew
about
her
own
heart
gradually
she
was
discovering
that
had
plenty
of
pride
of
birth
and
station
and
name
the
thing
which
had
seemed
plebeian
to
her
was
to
such
pride
in
a
marked
way
before
others
colman
seemed
to
consider
it
necessary
to
make
some
reply
dr
kent
is
an
uncle
of
mine
she
said
and
her
voice
was
freezing
in
its
dignity
you
don
t
say
where
is
he
now
how
i
should
like
to
see
the
dear
old
man
i
wonder
ruth
that
your
pa
didn
t
tell
me
his
relatives
lived
here
it
was
at
his
house
that
i
first
saw
your
pa
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
they
had
a
party
or
a
dinner
i
forget
what
the
name
of
it
was
but
it
was
after
the
wedding
you
know
and
crowds
of
fashionables
was
there
i
was
in
a
back
passage
helping
sort
out
the
rubbers
and
things
that
had
got
mixed
up
and
i
peeked
out
to
see
them
march
to
dinner
and
i
see
them
all
as
plain
as
day
i
said
i
to
mirandy
bates
the
girl
that
i
was
helping
that
tall
man
with
the
long
whiskers
and
pale
face
is
the
stylishest
one
amongst
em
i
and
who
do
you
suppose
it
was
but
your
pa
land
alive
i
had
just
as
much
idea
of
marrying
him
as
i
had
of
flying
and
no
i
should
suppose
so
said
schuyler
colman
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
saying
it
though
ruth
darted
a
lightning
glance
at
her
from
eyes
that
were
gleaming
in
a
face
that
had
become
very
pale
she
arose
suddenly
remarking
that
they
were
making
a
very
lengthy
call
and
erskine
to
whom
the
call
seemed
very
short
began
to
be
uncomfortably
conscious
that
she
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
and
perhaps
not
to
ruth
s
liking
she
relapsed
into
an
embarrassed
silence
and
made
her
adieu
in
the
most
awkward
manner
possible
had
ruth
taken
counsel
of
her
own
nerves
she
would
have
felt
it
impossible
to
endure
more
and
have
beaten
a
retreat
but
to
sustain
her
was
the
memory
of
the
fact
that
certain
calls
be
made
and
that
if
she
did
not
make
them
her
father
must
when
it
came
to
the
martyr
spirit
and
she
could
realize
that
she
was
being
martyrized
in
her
father
s
place
she
could
endure
but
oh
if
she
could
manage
to
give
this
dreadful
woman
a
hint
as
to
the
proprieties
and
yet
suppose
she
stopped
that
dreadful
tide
of
reminiscences
what
the
woman
talk
about
still
at
all
hazards
it
must
be
risked
i
do
not
think
she
began
in
a
tone
so
constrained
that
the
very
sound
of
it
frightened
her
i
do
not
think
that
my
father
would
like
to
have
you
refer
to
your
past
life
among
his
my
patience
said
judge
erskine
why
not
i
never
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
in
my
life
i
was
an
honest
respectable
girl
there
ain
t
one
who
knew
me
but
could
tell
you
that
and
as
to
being
poor
why
i
couldn
t
help
that
you
know
and
i
ain
t
been
rich
such
a
dreadful
long
time
that
i
ve
forgot
how
it
felt
neither
not
that
your
pa
kept
me
close
he
never
did
that
but
i
kept
myself
close
you
see
because
i
had
no
kind
of
a
notion
that
he
was
so
this
was
worse
than
the
former
strain
ruth
was
almost
desperate
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
how
poor
you
were
madam
but
it
is
not
the
custom
in
society
to
tell
all
about
one
s
private
and
then
in
the
next
breath
she
wondered
what
judge
erskine
would
have
said
could
he
have
heard
her
address
his
wife
in
that
tone
and
with
those
words
at
least
she
had
frightened
her
into
silence
and
they
rang
at
huntington
s
and
were
angry
woman
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
cowed
woman
who
wished
she
was
at
home
and
didn
t
know
what
to
say
poor
ruth
was
sorry
that
she
had
interfered
perhaps
any
sort
of
talk
would
have
been
less
observable
than
this
awkward
half
frightened
silence
also
judge
burnham
was
in
the
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
parlor
among
the
books
as
one
familiar
there
huntington
belonged
to
the
profession
was
it
more
or
less
embarrassing
because
of
his
presence
ruth
could
not
bring
herself
to
being
sure
which
it
was
huntington
was
a
genial
woman
though
an
exceedingly
stylish
one
but
she
knew
as
little
how
to
put
a
frightened
constrained
person
at
ease
as
it
was
possible
to
know
about
anything
and
yet
her
heart
was
good
enough
i
suppose
you
attended
the
concert
last
evening
erskine
she
said
addressing
that
lady
with
a
smile
and
in
a
winning
tone
of
voice
but
erskine
looked
over
at
ruth
in
the
absurd
fashion
of
a
naughty
child
who
having
been
punished
for
some
misdemeanor
glances
at
you
to
be
sure
that
he
is
not
offending
in
the
same
way
again
ruth
was
selecting
a
card
from
her
case
to
leave
for
miss
almina
huntington
and
apparently
gave
no
notice
to
her
mother
left
thus
to
her
own
resources
what
could
she
do
but
answer
as
best
she
knew
how
well
no
i
didn
t
judge
erskine
got
tickets
and
said
he
would
take
me
if
i
wanted
to
go
but
i
didn
t
want
to
go
the
fact
is
i
suppose
it
is
want
of
education
or
something
but
i
ain
t
a
might
of
taste
for
those
concerts
i
like
singing
too
i
used
to
go
to
when
i
was
a
girl
and
i
was
reckoned
to
have
a
good
voice
and
i
used
to
like
it
in
the
choir
you
know
and
all
that
but
these
performances
that
they
get
off
nowadays
and
call
music
i
can
t
stand
nohow
i
went
to
one
of
em
i
thought
i
d
like
to
please
judge
erskine
you
know
and
i
went
and
they
said
it
was
fine
and
perfectly
glorious
and
all
that
but
i
didn
t
think
so
and
that
s
the
whole
of
it
i
gaped
and
gaped
the
whole
blessed
evening
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
tried
to
listen
too
and
get
the
best
of
it
but
it
was
just
yelp
and
howl
and
i
couldn
t
make
out
a
word
no
more
than
if
it
had
been
in
dutch
and
i
dunno
but
it
was
i
don
t
like
em
and
i
can
t
help
erskine
was
growing
independent
and
indignant
silence
was
not
her
forte
and
in
the
few
minutes
which
she
had
spent
thus
she
had
resolved
not
to
pretend
to
be
what
she
wasn
t
i
don
t
like
them
yelping
women
nor
them
roaring
men
she
said
swiftly
to
herself
and
i
mean
to
say
so
why
shouldn
t
i
poor
ruth
it
was
not
that
she
enjoyed
or
admired
operatic
singing
or
the
usual
style
of
modern
concert
singing
in
a
calm
dignified
haughty
way
she
had
been
heard
to
say
that
she
thought
music
had
degenerated
and
was
being
put
to
very
unintellectual
uses
in
these
days
in
comparison
with
what
had
been
its
place
but
that
was
such
a
very
different
thing
from
talking
about
and
screeching
and
howling
and
above
all
what
be
said
huntington
was
not
equal
to
the
occasion
she
was
no
more
capable
of
appreciating
what
there
was
of
beauty
in
the
singing
than
her
caller
was
but
she
was
aware
that
society
expected
her
to
appreciate
it
so
she
did
it
judge
burnham
came
to
the
rescue
you
are
precisely
of
my
mind
mrs
erskine
he
said
appearing
from
the
recesses
of
the
back
parlor
and
bowing
to
ruth
while
he
advanced
to
offer
his
hand
to
her
you
have
characterized
the
recent
concerts
in
the
exact
language
that
they
deserve
such
singing
is
not
music
it
is
simply
why
judge
burnham
this
in
an
expostulating
tone
from
huntington
fact
my
dear
madam
it
was
simply
screeching
last
evening
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
was
a
victim
and
i
defy
anyone
with
a
cultured
taste
to
have
enjoyed
it
it
was
almost
an
impossibility
to
endure
erskine
i
want
to
show
you
a
picture
which
i
think
you
will
like
if
you
will

with

he
escorted
the
gratified
little
woman
down
the
length
of
the
parlor
and
devoted
himself
carefully
to
her
during
the
rest
of
the
very
brief
call
which
ruth
made
he
came
also
to
the
very
with
her
talking
still
to
the
mother
covering
with
dextrous
gallantry
her
awkwardness
of
manner
and
movement
thank
you
said
ruth
in
a
low
tone
as
he
turned
to
her
with
a
parting
bow
she
could
not
help
it
and
she
did
not
fail
to
notice
the
gleam
of
pleasure
which
lighted
his
grave
face
at
her
words
aren
t
you
tired
she
asked
her
mother
as
they
moved
away
from
the
huntington
mansion
her
martyr
spirit
had
passed
from
her
she
felt
utterly
worn
as
if
it
were
impossible
for
her
to
endure
more
don
t
you
want
to
go
home
bless
you
yes
i

clear
tuckered
out
i
didn
t
dream
that
it
was
such
awful
hard
work
to

don

your
pa
didn
t
want
to
go
yes
let
s
go
home
for
the
land
s
sake
and
they
went
home
when
ruth
thought
of
judge
burnham
at
all
during
the
next
few
days
it
was
with
a
sense
of
gratitude
which
was

not
unpleasant
chapter
x
other
people

crosses
one
could
not
live
long
in
this
world
without
realizing
the
forcefulness
of
the
sentence
every
heart
knoweth
his
own
behind
the
sunniest
apparently
most
enviable
life
the
bitterness
hides
it
will
not
be
supposed
that
marion
dennis
life
which
to
ruth
s
narrow
vision
had
blossomed
into
perfect
coloring
was
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
as
she
stands
in
her
pretty
waiting
for
the
coming
of
her
husband
and
gazes
out
of
the
window
at
the
play
of
light
and
shade
in
the
western
with
that
thoughtful
look
which
betokens
that
the
gazer
s
thoughts
are
not
upon
the
picture
which
her
eyes
is
plain
to
the
most
careless
glance
that
a
tinge
of
somber
hue
has
already
shaded
the
picture
of
her
life
she
had
been
through
an
ordeal
of
calls
that
afternoon
not
calls
from
intimate
and
congenial
friends
who
came
because
they
desired
the
pleasure
of
a
visit
with
her
but
from
some
of
those
who
came
as
in
custom
bound
to
pay
a
ceremonious
visit
to
the
new
wife
of
their
pastor
they
had
not
been
helpful
callers
without
offending
any
of
the
set
rules
which
are
supposed
to
govern
polite
society
they
had
yet
contrived
to
make
marion
feel
that
they
were
society
spies
with
eyes
all
about
them
and
ears
alert
to
hear
or
to
fancy
what
they
could
also
they
had
been
of
delighted
in
what
they
termed
plain
speaking
which
is
ofttimes
decorous
insult
if
that
expression
is
not
a
misnomer
there
are
people
not
quite
coarse
enough
to
express
adverse
criticism
directly
to
a
man
s
face
and
such
are
apt
to
resort
to
the
more
refined
coarseness
of
making
their
criticism
into
the
form
of
a
joke
and
aiming
it
at
the
face
of
his
wife
with
one
or
two
such
persons
had
marion
come
in
contact
i
hope
you
have
dennis
in
good
subjection
easterly
had
said
with
a
peculiar
little
laugh
that
was
meant
to
be
merry
and
that
jarred
without
one
s
being
able
to
define
why
there
is
nothing
like
beginning
right
you
know
i
told
easterly
last
evening
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
too
lenient
with
him
he
is
positively
in
danger
of
keeping
us
in
until
it
is
time
to
be
thinking
about
the
next
morning
s
breakfast
easterly
said
when
he
got
him
a
wife
home
would
be
more
attractive
to
him
but
my
dear
dennis
you
must
have
observed
that
there
was
no
improvement
last
i
observed
that
he
was
five
minutes
past
the
hour
marion
said
and
if
easterly
had
been
familiar
with
her
voice
she
would
have
discovered
that
it
was
haughty
in
the
extreme
dr
dennis
is
very
particular
to
close
promptly
and
when
i
questioned
him
he
said
the
people
were
tardy
about
getting
in
and
so
delayed
the
that
it
was
only
five
minutes
i
could
have
been
positive
it
was
fifteen
easterly
said
ignoring
the
explanation
and
the
statement
about
general
punctuality
such
people
always
ignore
remarks
that
are
not
easy
to
be
answered
then
the
smooth
voice
went
on
i
think
a
clergyman
should
try
to
cultivate
habits
of
punctuality
about
as
well
as
opening
meetings
so
many
people
are
by
long
drawn
out
as
for
instance
lectures
by
infidels
and
the
like
remarks
marion
still
with
the
dryness
of
tone
that
those
familiar
to
her
understand
and
calling
to
mind
the
fact
that
she
had
heard
of
easterly
as
a
delighted
listener
for
an
hour
and
three
quarters
to
the
popular
infidel
orator
two
evenings
before
oh
why
of
course
they
have
a
set
time
every
one
knows
they
must
be
lengthy
they
have
abstruse
themes
to
handle
and
many
classes
of
hearers
to
but
the
mere
commonplaces
of
a
can
be
compressed
into
small
compass
as
well
as
not
the
theme
of
personal
salvation
not
being
supposed
to
be
of
much
importance
nor
very
abstruse
i
easterly
arched
her
eyebrows
said
nothing
because
she
didn
t
know
what
to
say
made
the
rest
of
her
stay
brief
and
remarked
when
she
had
gotten
out
of
marion
s
hearing
that
she
had
heard
miss
wilbur
spoken
of
as
infidel
tendencies
indeed
perhaps
there
was
a
shade
of
truth
in
it
for
her
part
she
wondered
that
dennis
should
have
been
so
imprudent
as
to
have
selected
that
sort
of
a
wife
it
was
imprudent
in
marion
to
have
answered
her
caller
in
those
words
or
in
that
spirit
sarcasm
was
lost
on
her
for
she
hadn
t
the
right
sort
of
brains
to
understand
it
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
certain
people
who
can
be
very
sarcastic
in
themselves
can
not
understand
or
appreciate
it
in
others
and
so
trivial
a
matter
as
this
troubled
marion
well
yes
it
did
she
had
not
been
long
in
her
position
you
will
remember
it
was
really
her
first
rude
awakening
from
the
dream
that
all
christian
people
regarded
their
pastor
with
a
certain
reverent
courtesy
not
in
a
cringing
or
servile
spirit
not
in
a
spirit
in
any
sense
at
variance
with
true
independence
of
thought
and
action
but
in
the
chivalrous
spirit
of
the
olden
time
reverencing
the
office
rather
than
the
man
and
according
all
possible
courtesy
to
the
man
of
the
position
he
held
as
ambassador
from
the
king
s
court
marion
s
early
childhood
had
been
spent
among
simple
earnest
whose
reverent
spirit
had
been
an
outgrowth
of
puritan
new
england
and
while
her
later
years
had
passed
among
a
very
different
class
of
people
she
yet
had
clung
to
the
fancy
that
everywhere
cherished
the
bond
of
tie
stronger
than
that
of
spoke
wisely
and
with
respect
of
those
who
belonged
like
themselves
to
the
royal
family
easterly
s
words
had
jarred
not
only
because
dennis
was
her
husband
but
because
he
was
a
clergyman
and
because
he
was
easterly
s
pastor
much
had
she
to
learn
you
will
observe
she
was
more
than
likely
to
meet
often
with
people
to
whom
the
word
pastor
meant
less
than
any
other
if
they
took
time
to
analyze
their
own
feelings
one
to
whom
they
could
be
rude
or
free
or
insultingly
inquisitive
without
fear
of
rousing
him
to
resentment
because
resentment
is
not
a
becoming
trait
in
the
ministry
dennis
would
have
smiled
could
he
have
known
the
turmoil
in
his
wife
s
heart
he
had
so
long
ago
passed
beyond
so
long
ago
decided
that
people
must
be
ranked
in
many
from
this
strip
of
humanity
who
did
not
know
the
difference
between
frankness
and
many
in
this
strip
who
because
of
their
lack
of
early
education
must
not
be
expected
to
know
certain
many
in
this
strip
to
whom
he
could
talk
freely
familiarly
as
brother
to
brother
and
friend
to
christians
belonging
to
the
family
indeed
but
having
such
different
degrees
of
likeness
to
the
family
name
that
what
was
a
matter
of
course
from
one
was
a
sting
from
another
all
these
things
dennis
knew
all
these
things
his
wife
had
still
to
learn
she
was
willing
to
learn
and
she
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
suppose
that
her
road
was
strewn
with
roses
but
all
the
name
the
tiny
thorn
pricked
her
there
were
other
and
graver
troubles
than
this
do
you
remember
how
she
pleased
her
fancy
while
yet
she
was
an
inhabitant
of
that
dingy
room
as
to
the
dainty
little
teas
she
would
get
for
that
young
daughter
of
hers
here
it
was
the
very
perfection
of
a
exquisite
and
delicate
and
fascinating
in
all
its
appointments
laid
for
three
yet
presently
when
dennis
came
from
his
round
of
calls
and
seated
himself
opposite
his
wife
and
waited
and
then
finally
sent
a
messenger
to
gracie
s
room
who
returned
with
the
message
miss
grace
says
will
you
please
excuse
her
this
evening
she
doesn
t
care
for
any
tea
his
face
clouded
as
though
the
answer
brought
trouble
to
his
heart
have
you
had
further
talk
with
grace
he
asked
his
wife
when
the
door
had
closed
on
the
servant
a
little
there
have
been
callers
most
of
the
time
but
i
talked
with
her
a
few
what
did
she
say
marion
would
rather
he
had
not
asked
the
question
she
hesitated
a
little
then
said
with
an
effort
to
speak
lightly
she
said
what
was
natural
she
thought
knew
almost
too
much
about
the
matter
and
might
have
been
content
to
leave
it
to
i
will
not
have
her
speaking
in
that
manner
to
you
he
said
his
face
growing
graver
and
his
forehead
settling
into
a
frown
she
ought
to
know
i
know
it
answered
marion
a
little
dash
of
brightness
in
her
voice
she
ought
to
be
perfect
of
course
and
not
give
way
in
this
undignified
manner
it
is
only
such
old
saints
as
you
and
i
who
have
any
right
to
get
out
of
tone
when
things
do
not
go
just
to
suit
he
laughed
a
little
then
he
said
now
marion
you
know
she
has
tried
you
very
much
and
without
as
to
that
i
suppose
if
you
and
i
could
see
into
her
heart
she
thinks
she
has
sore
cause
i
would
not
make
too
much
of
it
if
i
were
you
and
i
would
make
nothing
at
all
of
the
part
which
has
to
do
with
me
she
will
feel
differently
before
very
long
she
is
then
dennis
thoughts
went
back
to
his
daughter
he
sighed
heavily
i
ought
to
have
shielded
her
better
i
was
trying
i
thought
i
am
so
astonished
about
that
man
he
has
been
a
professor
of
religion
ever
since
he
was
a
to
profess
a
thing
is
not
always
to
possess
it
marion
said
and
then
she
sighed
to
think
that
even
in
religion
this
was
so
true
and
she
sighed
again
to
realize
that
in
her
hard
life
she
had
come
more
in
contact
with
people
who
without
possessing
than
her
husband
had
the
trouble
about
gracie
was
not
so
light
as
she
had
tried
to
make
it
appear
to
the
father
neither
had
her
attempt
to
reason
the
obstinate
young
daughter
into
something
like
graceful
yielding
been
so
free
from
as
she
would
have
him
think
it
was
all
about
ellis
a
man
who
as
marion
expressed
it
to
her
husband
was
good
enough
for
a
teacher
but
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
for
one
so
young
and
so
impressible
as
gracie
to
ride
away
with
to
an
evening
entertainment
he
is
the
only
one
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
allowing
her
to
ride
with
the
father
had
said
aghast
and
then
had
followed
on
marion
s
part
a
startled
exclamation
to
the
effect
that
she
would
have
trusted
her
sooner
with
a
dozen
of
the
boys
with
whom
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
associate
they
are
better
than
he
she
said
earnestly
and
then
had
followed
a
long
confidential
talk
which
had
ended
in
the
peremptory
and
by
no
means
wisely
put
negative
to
gracie
s
plans
and
then
had
followed
on
her
part
questionings
and
surmises
until
at
last
she
understood
that
this
new
mother
who
had
been
but
a
little
while
ago
a
stranger
to
them
both
had
come
between
her
father
and
herself
and
then
had
followed
as
anyone
of
sense
might
have
known
there
would
a
scene
which
was
by
no
means
complimentary
to
gracie
or
comforting
to
the
new
mother
she
had
tried
to
be
wise
gracie
she
had
said
in
her
gentlest
tone
you
know
i
am
a
good
many
years
older
than
you
and
i
have
known
ellis
very
well
and
i
am
sure
if
you
realized
just
the
sort
of
a
man
he
is
you
would
not
care
to
be
his
familiar
i
don
t
want
to
be
his
familiar
friend
gracie
had
said
haughtily
i
want
to
take
a
ride
out
to
katie
s
with
him
when
i
have
promised
to
do
and
then
her
eyes
had
fallen
under
the
calm
of
marion
s
searching
gaze
and
her
tones
had
faltered
at
least
i
do
not
see
that
riding
out
with
him
is
a
proof
of
very
great
friendship
it
is
no
more
than
i
have
done
several
times
with
my
father
s
but
your
father
was
deceived
in
him
gracie
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
the
sort
of
man
he
is
save
by
his
professions
which
have
been
nothing
professions
for
years
gracie
i
know
that
of
him
which
should
make
every
young
girl
unwilling
to
be
seen
in
his
society
or
considered
his
whereupon
gracie
s
eyes
had
flashed
indignation
for
a
second
then
settled
into
sullenness
while
she
answered
coldly
i
should
think
my
father
ought
to
have
been
capable
of
judging
character
a
little
he
has
had
something
to
do
with
men
and
life
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
not
be
able
to
trust
myself
to
marion
smiled
it
was
hard
to
be
patient
with
this
girl
the
haughty
way
in
which
she
retired
behind
her
dignity
and
said
father
seemed
designed
to
shut
marion
out
from
ownership
in
him
and
impress
her
with
the
sense
of
the
newness
of
her
acquaintance
with
and
entrance
into
the
family
gracie
she
said
again
after
a
thoughtful
pause
it
may
not
be
known
to
you
that
there
have
been
recent
developments
about
ellis
that
make
him
an
undesirable
friend
for
you
i
know
that
as
your
teacher
you
have
learned
to
look
up
to
and
respect
him
but
he
is
in
some
respects
there
was
for
a
few
minutes
no
response
from
the
girl
with
her
head
bent
low
over
the
slate
as
if
during
the
intervals
of
this
conversation
she
had
eyes
and
thought
only
for
the
intricate
problem
before
her
presently
she
said
in
exactly
the
same
tone
of
repressed
indignation
which
she
had
used
before
i
repeat
that
in
my
judgment
father
is
just
as
capable
of
deciding
as
to
what
gentlemen
are
suited
to
be
my
friends
as
a
stranger
can
marion
drew
back
quickly
she
caught
her
breath
hard
this
was
a
trying
spot
what
should
she
do
or
say
what
would
ruth
erskine
have
done
in
her
place
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
sense
of
relief
in
believing
that
this
young
girl
s
pride
only
was
touched
not
her
heart
she
was
simply
rebellious
that
a
stranger
as
she
chose
to
call
her
should
presume
to
interfere
with
her
friendships
i
am
not
a
stranger
gracie
she
said
trying
to
speak
in
all
gentleness
i
am
your
father
s
wife
and
have
at
his
request
assumed
responsibilities
concerning
you
for
which
i
am
answerable
not
only
to
him
but
to
god
when
i
tell
you
therefore
what
your
father
has
had
no
means
of
knowing
until
lately
that
ellis
is
the
sort
of
man
whom
a
young
lady
should
shun
you
ought
to
believe
me
and
to
understand
that
my
sole
motive
is
your
then
was
marion
dennis
treated
to
a
brilliant
flashing
of
the
handsome
eyes
of
her
daughter
the
slate
and
book
slid
to
the
floor
with
an
unheeded
crash
as
gracie
rising
and
drawing
up
her
tall
form
till
it
equalled
her
mother
s
said
in
tones
of
suppressed
passion
marion
wilbur
you
have
no
to
speak
in
that
manner
of
ellis
and
i
will
not
bear
it
then
marion
dennis
drew
back
grieved
and
frightened
not
at
her
own
was
but
the
of
an
angry
because
she
began
to
fear
that
this
wolf
in
sheep
s
clothing
whose
chief
entertainment
hitherto
had
been
to
see
how
well
he
could
play
with
human
dared
to
try
his
powers
on
gracie
dennis
i
hope
he
will
suffer
for
this
she
said
under
her
breath
in
the
meantime
what
was
to
be
said
to
the
angry
girl
whose
passion
had
culminated
in
this
outburst
and
who
then
had
thrown
herself
back
into
the
chair
not
weeping
not
crushed
and
bleeding
but
excitedly
and
yet
feeling
that
she
had
said
a
very
unwise
and
dangerous
thing
and
must
answer
for
not
caring
just
now
in
what
way
she
might
be
called
upon
to
answer
being
still
in
the
mood
to
be
glad
that
she
had
said
it
she
expected
severity
and
waited
for
it
gracie
said
marion
bending
toward
her
and
i
do
not
know
that
her
voice
had
ever
been
gentler
or
her
manner
more
quiet
you
do
not
mean
to
hurt
i
know
you
do
not
we
are
too
nearly
related
we
are
sisters
the
lord
jesus
christ
is
our
elder
it
is
to
him
that
i
ask
you
to
listen
it
is
to
his
judgment
not
mine
that
i
ask
you
to
defer
will
you
lay
this
matter
before
him
and
wait
on
your
knees
for
his
answer
and
abide
by
it
never
minding
me
if
you
will
the
whole
matter
will
be
then
she
turned
from
her
and
went
down
to
receive
those
calls
and
get
those
little
thrusts
and
which
pricked
so
much
deeper
and
left
a
keener
sting
because
in
general
they
were
leveled
at
her
husband
instead
of
herself
then
she
went
out
to
that
pretty
table
laid
for
three
and
saw
the
father
and
heard
his
and
held
back
that
which
would
have
made
him
indignant
in
the
extreme
and
held
back
her
own
little
sigh
and
realized
that
life
was
not
all
sweetness
even
while
ruth
sat
at
home
and
envied
the
brightness
of
her
lot
chapter
xi
a
cross
ruth
erskine
meantime
was
keeping
up
her
struggle
having
intervals
when
she
seemed
to
be
making
headway
and
felt
as
though
she
had
reached
higher
ground
only
to
be
dropped
suddenly
down
again
into
the
depths
of
despair
by
some
unfortunate
encounter
with
the
no
more
definite
comment
on
the
existing
state
of
things
could
be
made
than
is
shadowed
in
that
expression
they
still
continued
to
be
thought
of
as
such
in
the
house
they
did
not
drift
into
the
family
ways
or
did
not
assimilate
everything
was
so
new
to
them
so
unlike
their
entire
former
education
that
much
of
the
time
they
stood
one
side
and
looked
on
instead
of
mingling
and
having
their
individuality
lost
in
the
union
so
far
as
erskine
was
concerned
she
did
not
look
on
it
had
been
no
part
of
her
discipline
to
learn
quietness
she
talked
everywhere
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
and
she
seemed
always
to
chance
upon
the
things
to
say
that
were
particularly
unfortunate
just
then
and
there
this
being
the
case
it
is
perhaps
not
strange
that
the
rasping
processes
were
so
numerous
that
there
was
not
time
between
them
for
healings
judge
erskine
on
his
part
made
nearly
as
little
progress
being
a
man
of
faultless
grace
and
bearing
and
being
noted
for
fastidiousness
made
him
susceptible
to
wounds
in
these
directions
generally
he
and
ruth
maintained
the
strictest
silence
toward
each
other
concerning
their
trials
they
having
by
tacit
consent
agreed
upon
that
as
the
safest
course
but
occasionally
they
were
rasped
into
comparing
notes
in
the
hall
one
morning
where
many
of
their
confidential
conversations
were
held
during
these
days
her
father
stopped
her
with
an
almost
petitioning
question
daughter
was
it
very
trying
yesterday
when
blakesley
called
as
trying
as
it
could
be
sir
ruth
answered
still
smarting
so
much
under
that
recent
infliction
that
she
could
not
bring
her
voice
to
a
sympathetic
tone
mrs
blakesley
being
a
woman
who
hasn
t
an
ounce
of
brains
herself
has
as
you
may
imagine
none
to
spare
for
other
people
indeed
father
i
sometimes
feel
as
though
this
matter
of
making
and
receiving
calls
was
going
to
be
too
complicated
a
thing
for
me
i
never
was
fond
of
such
duties
as
you
may
remember
and
now
it
is
absolute
torture
long
drawn
i
know
it
he
said
wincing
and
growing
paler
under
each
stabbing
word
from
his
daughter
s
lips
it
was
all
folly
i
am
afraid
i
thought
we
would
try
to
do
just
right
but
i
do
not
know
but
we
would
have
felt
it
less
and
they
been
just
as
happy
if
we
had
resolutely
closed
our
doors
on
society
altogether
and
borne
this
thing
among
what
these
two
people
needed
was
some
strong
voice
to
remind
them
how
many
and
how
much
harder
troubles
life
had
than
they
had
been
called
upon
to
bear
despite
marion
dennis
opinion
this
it
should
help
by
comparison
with
other
s
trials
we
ought
to
be
led
to
feel
the
lesser
nature
of
our
own
failing
in
that
it
sometimes
happens
to
us
to
decide
as
to
which
of
our
trials
has
the
heaviest
hand
i
don
t
think
that
would
have
been
possible
ruth
answered
her
tone
somewhat
subdued
as
it
always
was
by
a
realization
of
her
father
s
deeper
wound
but
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
saw
a
way
to
escape
from
some
of
this
calling
there
are
hundreds
almost
yet
to
make
and
some
of
them
more
formidable
than
any
that
we
have
attempted
and
the
list
continues
to
swell
every
the
father
had
no
answer
he
saw
no
way
out
and
yet
a
way
was
coming
which
would
help
them
both
out
of
this
dilemma
at
least
it
was
the
very
next
morning
that
judge
erskine
failed
to
appear
at
the
and
his
wife
brought
word
that
he
was
most
uncommon
restless
all
night
and
pretty
fevery
and
resisted
all
her
suggestions
to
give
him
a
good
sweat
or
to
drink
any
or
even
to
soak
his
feet
in
consequence
was
he
didn
t
feel
able
to
raise
his
head
from
his
pillow
and
wouldn
t
so
much
as
let
her
speak
of
any
breakfast
though
she
tell
over
several
things
to
him
that
she
thought
he
might
relish
ruth
groaned
inwardly
not
so
much
at
anxiety
for
her
sicknesses
were
slight
affairs
soon
over
and
his
most
sovereign
remedy
had
hitherto
been
to
be
let
alone
how
then
had
he
borne
this
fearful
infliction
of
sympathy
and
fertile
suggestion
but
the
sickness
whatever
it
was
did
not
pass
away
as
others
had
done
ruth
visiting
him
and
seeing
the
fevered
face
and
anxious
eyes
felt
a
nameless
dread
and
entreated
that
bacon
might
at
once
be
summoned
being
even
more
alarmed
at
the
fact
that
her
father
immediately
acquiesced
bacon
was
slow
in
coming
being
a
man
much
sought
after
in
his
profession
but
he
was
also
unprecedentedly
slow
in
leaving
making
a
call
the
length
of
which
amazed
ruth
and
at
which
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
alarmed
or
relieved
during
its
continuance
judge
burnham
stopped
to
inquire
as
to
some
law
papers
and
also
apparently
to
make
a
call
for
he
tarried
after
he
found
that
he
could
not
accomplish
his
original
errand
and
was
in
the
hall
in
the
act
of
leaving
when
the
doctor
came
with
slow
and
thoughtful
tread
that
gentleman
caught
at
his
familiar
face
as
if
it
were
a
relief
ah
good
morning
judge
he
said
this
is
opportune
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
and
then
he
unceremoniously
pushed
open
the
library
door
and
both
gentlemen
retired
within
leaving
ruth
perplexed
and
perhaps
a
little
annoyed
the
door
closed
upon
them
bacon
was
not
long
in
making
known
his
thoughts
judge
are
you
an
intimate
friend
of
this
family
why
said
judge
burnham
hesitating
and
flushing
a
little
over
the
question
i
hardly
know
whether
i
may
claim
exceeding
intimacy
the
judge
is
not
apt
to
have
very
intimate
friends
perhaps
i
come
as
near
it
as
anybody
yes
i
think
i
may
say
i
am
considered
a
at
least
why
may
i
ask
because
they
need
a
who
is
not
afraid
of
himself
or
his
feelings
and
can
help
them
plan
and
perhaps
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
is
the
judge
so
very
sick
well
as
to
that
he
is
likely
to
be
sick
indeed
than
i
care
to
have
his
daughter
realize
just
at
present
but
the
of
the
sickness
is
the
trouble
it
is
a
very
marked
case
of
a
very
undesirable
type
of
now
don
t
back
out
of
the
nearest
door
and
leave
me
in
the
lurch
for
i
depend
on
this
last
as
judge
burnham
uttered
an
exclamation
of
dismay
and
stepped
backward
the
sentence
recalled
his
don
t
be
disturbed
he
said
and
his
tones
were
somewhat
haughty
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
fleeing
i
shall
be
glad
to
serve
him
and
family
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
what
is
there
for
me
to
do
is
he
aware
of
the
situation
most
decidedly
so
i
didn
t
mince
matters
with
him
he
is
not
one
that
will
bear
it
he
knows
all
that
i
do
and
is
as
as
usual
he
knows
certain
things
that
must
be
done
for
instance
his
daughter
ruth
is
on
no
account
to
be
allowed
to
put
her
head
inside
the
door
he
was
peremptory
about
that
and
must
be
obeyed
though
there
is
no
earthly
fear
of
infection
for
some
days
yet
but
i
have
given
my
word
of
honor
that
it
shall
be
as
he
says
the
trouble
is
they
will
be
left
in
the
lurch
there
isn
t
a
nurse
in
the
city
that
i
know
of
i
would
have
given
fifty
dollars
an
hour
almost
for
a
good
one
last
night
and
besides
the
servants
must
be
informed
and
they
will
leave
to
a
man
or
a
woman
in
books
you
are
always
reading
of
heroic
servants
who
are
willing
to
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
stand
by
their
mistresses
through
anything
i
wish
i
could
find
a
few
of
them
i
would
promise
them
high
wages
well
now
what
you
can
do
first
is
to
explain
the
state
of
affairs
to
miss
erskine
i
would
sooner
try
to
explain
to
an
iceberg
or
a
am
never
quite
sure
which
she
is
and
then
if
you
have
any
wits
set
them
to
work
to
establish
communication
between
this
house
and
the
outer
world
in
other
words
do
what
you
can
for
them
you
can
you
know
better
than
i
do
whether
you
are
on
sufficient
terms
of
intimacy
to
do
anything
with
her
the
old
lady
must
be
told
i
suppose
though
judge
erskine
didn
t
mention
her
at
all
perhaps
she
will
want
to
get
out
of
the
house
somewhere
and
very
likely
you
can
manage
that
at
least
the
first
thing
of
importance
is
to
tell
miss
ruth
will
you
do
it
said
judge
burnham
speaking
slowly
and
hesitatingly
it
was
by
no
means
the
sort
of
communication
that
he
desired
to
make
to
her
yet
he
felt
an
instant
desire
to
stand
by
her
and
if
disagreeable
tidings
must
be
given
bear
them
himself
in
whatever
alleviating
way
he
might
very
well
answered
the
doctor
promptly
he
was
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
on
this
case
and
was
getting
in
haste
i
ought
to
have
been
off
fifteen
minutes
ago
but
judge
erskine
wanted
all
the
affairs
of
the
nation
arranged
before
i
left
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
so
far
as
it
is
within
the
compass
of
human
possibility
he
intends
to
have
it
will
you
see
miss
ruth
at
once
and
do
what
planning
you
can
meantime
i
will
make
one
more
dash
for
a
nurse
no
one
is
to
go
up
to
judge
erskine
until
i
see
him
again
i
fancy
he
wants
to
do
some
thinking
for
himself
that
is
his
peremptory
order
and
it
will
be
well
enough
to
obey
it
there
is
no
sort
of
danger
of
infection
now
you
understand
but
he
is
quite
as
well
off
alone
for
a
little
now
i
positively
must
go
i
will
look
in
on
my
way
down
the
square
and
report
and
then
the
great
doctor
took
himself
off
leaving
judge
burnham
with
the
worst
case
on
his
hands
that
had
ever
fallen
to
his
professional
life
he
walked
slowly
toward
the
door
but
before
he
could
pass
out
it
was
pushed
open
by
ruth
her
face
white
and
frightened
judge
burnham
what
has
happened
what
is
the
matter
is
my
father
so
very
sick
and
why
am
i
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
him
one
thing
at
a
time
dear
friend
he
said
and
his
voice
had
a
touch
of
sympathy
that
could
not
have
escaped
her
your
father
is
not
alarmingly
sick
but
the
sickness
is
of
such
a
nature
that
he
will
not
have
you
exposed
to
it
even
for
a
moment
it
was
his
first
and
then
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
gently
placed
her
in
it
and
sat
down
beside
her
telling
her
briefly
rapidly
in
a
half
professional
manner
all
he
knew
himself
he
was
a
good
student
of
human
nature
his
success
in
his
profession
would
have
proved
that
and
he
knew
it
was
the
surest
way
to
hold
her
and
ready
for
intelligent
thought
he
had
not
misjudged
her
character
she
neither
cried
out
nor
fainted
she
had
been
pale
enough
before
but
her
face
whitened
a
little
and
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
for
an
instant
it
was
a
curious
revelation
to
her
of
the
strangeness
of
these
human
hearts
of
ours
when
she
remembered
afterward
that
flashing
along
with
the
other
crowding
thoughts
as
to
what
and
how
there
came
the
swift
memory
of
the
yesterday
s
talk
and
the
instant
realization
of
the
fact
that
they
would
have
neither
to
make
nor
receive
any
more
of
those
dreadful
calls
for
some
time
at
least
just
a
moment
of
hiding
behind
those
hands
and
then
she
was
ready
for
action
judge
burnham
have
you
thought
what
ought
to
be
done
first
and
if
you
have
will
you
help
me
it
makes
it
harder
because
my
father
will
not
let
me
come
to
him
if
we
could
talk
together
if
he
would
let
me
be
his
nurse
i
and
then
she
hesitated
and
her
lip
began
to
quiver
she
remembered
that
her
father
was
the
one
person
whom
she
had
to
love
there
is
no
use
in
talking
about
that
judge
burnham
said
hastily
the
doctor
said
he
ought
by
all
means
to
be
humored
in
this
matter
that
it
would
help
to
keep
him
calm
and
thus
hold
the
disease
in
check
you
should
not
have
a
thought
of
going
to
him
some
nurse
can
surely
be
found
people
will
do
anything
for
money
i
suppose
miss
erskine
it
will
be
necessary
to
tell
the
other
members
of
the
family
of
course
ruth
said
and
she
tried
not
to
shiver
visibly
as
she
thought
of
what
erskine
might
say
and
wondered
whether
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
were
ignorantly
and
wildly
afraid
of
infection
and
whether
there
would
be
a
scene
with
her
and
what
susan
would
do
or
say
then
she
thought
of
the
servants
hannah
and
thomas
and
the
rest
ought
to
be
told
ought
they
not
judge
burnham
then
she
suddenly
roused
from
her
appealing
tones
and
rising
said
how
foolishly
i
am
talking
this
thing
has
startled
me
so
of
course
they
must
be
told
and
it
should
be
done
at
once
i
will
take
no
unfair
advantage
of
them
in
any
way
yes
i
will
tell
erskine
and
my
sister
thank
you
judge
and
that
gentleman
began
to
consider
himself
as
almost
dismissed
from
her
presence
what
can
i
do
for
you
first
he
asked
her
eagerly
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
are
afraid
of
anything
miss
erskine
in
mortal
guise
at
least
i
am
going
up
to
see
your
father
and
since
you
can
not
go
yourself
you
might
make
me
your
messenger
to
say
anything
that
you
would
say
that
you
are
willing
to
have
me
her
eyes
brightened
thank
you
she
said
it
is
very
pleasant
to
feel
that
you
do
not
want
to
desert
us
but
i
will
not
trouble
papa
until
i
can
tell
him
that
we
are
arranged
somehow
and
that
he
need
not
she
went
down
first
to
the
kitchen
regions
and
summoned
the
working
force
telling
them
in
brief
clear
language
what
had
fallen
upon
the
house
and
offering
them
each
two
weeks
wages
in
advance
and
good
characters
she
was
young
and
had
not
been
put
to
many
such
tests
they
were
not
servants
in
a
book
it
appeared
for
they
every
one
eagerly
caught
at
their
liberty
and
were
nervously
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
house
not
even
desiring
to
wait
until
ruth
could
get
her
and
make
good
her
word
were
young
and
ignorant
and
in
the
great
outside
world
they
had
friends
life
was
dear
to
them
who
shall
blame
them
and
yet
i
desire
to
say
just
here
that
it
is
in
books
only
that
noble
exceptions
to
this
form
of
selfishness
are
found
i
have
known
kitchens
that
ought
to
have
glowed
with
the
beauty
of
the
strong
unselfish
hearts
beating
there
through
danger
and
trial
and
harassing
toil
it
only
happened
that
ruth
erskine
had
none
of
those
about
her
and
within
half
an
hour
after
the
first
word
had
reached
them
she
stood
alone
in
her
deserted
kitchen
trying
to
get
her
nerves
quiet
for
the
next
and
to
her
more
trying
ordeal
what
would
those
new
elements
in
the
household
say
was
erskine
given
to
hysteria
and
would
these
startling
developments
produce
an
attack
would
they
want
to
get
away
from
the
house
could
they
be
gotten
away
quietly
to
some
safe
place
would
susan
be
willing
to
go
how
would
take
the
news
ruth
puzzled
her
brain
some
weary
minutes
in
trying
to
decide
just
how
they
would
act
and
whether
she
had
courage
to
tell
them
and
whether
it
were
not
altogether
possible
that
erskine
might
be
moved
to
make
such
an
outcry
as
should
disturb
the
sick
man
at
last
she
gave
over
the
attempt
to
arrange
their
actions
for
them
and
went
to
summon
them
to
the
library
with
an
air
of
forced
calmness
and
a
determination
to
have
this
worst
feature
of
the
side
issues
over
as
soon
as
possible
chapter
xii
the
cross
of
helplessness
my
land
alive
that
was
what
erskine
said
when
ruth
told
her
the
news
you
may
have
observed
that
those
three
words
constituted
a
favorite
expression
of
which
she
was
apt
to
use
on
all
occasions
greatly
to
her
stepdaughter
s
discomfiture
she
winced
under
it
now
it
seemed
so
ridiculously
inappropriate
to
the
disaster
that
had
come
into
their
midst
while
she
was
trying
to
impress
the
situation
on
the
mother
and
susan
bacon
returned
he
came
directly
into
the
library
as
one
who
had
laid
aside
all
the
ceremonies
of
private
life
and
adopted
the
business
style
he
hurried
into
the
midst
of
the
difficulties
being
one
who
while
capable
of
feeling
the
most
intense
and
practical
sympathy
for
others
had
never
learned
the
art
of
expressing
it
other
than
by
actions
miss
ruth
i
am
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
almost
impossible
to
get
a
proper
nurse
for
your
father
there
is
a
good
deal
of
this
abominable
disease
in
the
city
now
and
the
nurses
are
taxed
to
the
utmost
ordinary
nurses
you
know
will
not
come
and
would
not
do
anyway
so
we
shall
have
to
manage
as
well
as
we
can
for
a
little
until
i
can
look
around
me
and
get
then
erskine
came
to
the
front
what
are
you
talking
who
wants
one
of
em
miserable
creatures
not
but
what
i
ve
seen
some
good
ones
in
my
day
but
i
could
beat
any
of
em
when
it
come
to
a
real
case
of
sickness
and
i
can
nurse
my
own
husband
you
ll
find
better
than
the
best
of
em
i
brought
him
back
from
death
s
door
once
and
i
will
try
hard
to
do
it
again
a
is
the
last
kind
of
a
creature
that
i
want
to
help
but
erskine
i
ought
not
to
conceal
from
you
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
decided
case
of
the
chances
of
infection
to
one
who
nurses
him
will
be
very
i
can
t
help
you
know
she
said
determinedly
got
to
be
with
him
of
course
who
would
if
his
wife
wasn
t
i
don
t
believe
i
ll
take
it
i
never
was
one
of
them
kind
that
always
took
things
i
have
the
and
that
s
every
blessed
thing
i
do
have
except
a
touch
of
the
rheumatism
now
and
then
but
i
never
did
have
a
bit
of
headache
nor
nothing
when
there
was
any
real
sickness
on
my
hands
all
the
time
susan
had
the
fever
i
sot
up
nights
or
stood
good
deal
of
the
time
she
was
that
sick
that
i
didn
t
set
down
i
jest
kept
on
the
trot
all
night
doing
one
thing
and
another
but
all
the
while
i
never
had
an
ache
nor
a
pain
about
me
and
if
i
do
take
it
i
might
as
well
as
the
next
one
i
ain
t
a
mite
afraid
of
it
not
that
i
d
run
into
it
any
quicker
than
you
would
but
when
it
runs
into
your
own
house
and
gets
hold
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
or
your
is
the
next
thing
to
then
i
m
one
of
them
kind
that
has
to
be
on
hand
there
s
no
use
talkin
m
a
going
to
nurse
and
all
the
doctor
s
in
the
city
can
t
stop
i
assure
you
erskine
i
haven
t
the
least
desire
to
do
so
on
the
contrary
i
appreciate
your
the
doctor
s
tone
was
manner
respectful
judge
erskine
had
evidently
risen
several
degrees
in
his
esteem
she
was
not
a
piece
of
putty
to
be
gotten
out
of
the
way
in
the
least
troublesome
manner
but
a
live
and
very
energetic
factor
in
this
business
a
woman
who
not
only
was
not
afraid
of
but
could
calmly
insist
on
her
right
to
attend
a
very
bad
case
of
it
was
deserving
of
all
respect
from
him
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
care
how
many
grammatical
errors
she
made
in
expressing
her
determination
in
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
tell
you
of
it
the
question
of
attendant
on
the
sick
man
was
settled
and
erskine
installed
as
nurse
by
the
relieved
doctor
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
but
ruth
she
thought
in
dismay
of
the
misery
which
her
father
would
be
called
to
endure
how
was
he
sick
and
she
knew
he
could
be
fearfully
nervous
when
only
a
little
bear
the
strain
of
that
woman
s
tongue
when
in
health
it
was
more
than
he
could
endure
what
would
he
say
to
the
plan
would
he
feel
that
she
might
have
shielded
him
from
it
yet
how
could
help
it
and
indeed
what
else
could
be
done
she
had
been
very
nervous
over
his
being
left
alone
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
disregard
his
positive
command
and
go
to
him
and
it
had
been
such
a
source
of
relief
and
comfort
when
judge
burnham
announced
his
intention
of
going
that
she
felt
she
could
never
forget
it
certainly
it
would
not
do
to
leave
him
without
an
attendant
yet
she
could
not
be
grateful
to
the
wife
for
proposing
it
he
can
never
endure
it
she
murmured
and
she
looked
her
distress
so
completely
that
the
doctor
was
moved
to
soothe
her
when
he
came
back
from
installing
erskine
and
giving
her
directions
it
will
do
for
a
few
days
my
dear
girl
or
at
least
for
a
few
hours
until
we
can
look
about
us
and
secure
professional
assistance
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
of
her
taking
the
disease
you
know
indeed
you
might
be
with
him
yourself
only
he
is
so
nervous
about
you
that
he
will
not
listen
to
reason
but
she
will
take
good
care
of
him
i
really
think
she
understands
how
to
do
ruth
made
no
reply
she
could
not
she
wanted
to
ask
what
her
father
said
and
whether
he
was
likely
to
bear
up
under
such
an
added
weight
of
misery
as
this
last
but
reflecting
that
it
would
not
do
to
say
anything
of
the
kind
she
took
refuge
in
silence
and
the
work
of
rearranging
this
disorganized
and
disordered
household
went
on
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
considering
all
that
had
to
be
planned
and
arranged
the
doctor
had
done
his
share
of
it
given
explicit
and
peremptory
directions
as
to
what
should
and
what
should
be
done
and
was
gone
as
for
judge
burnham
he
had
gone
directly
from
the
to
judge
erskine
s
office
on
a
matter
of
business
for
the
latter
so
the
two
sisters
were
left
alone
in
the
library
to
stare
at
each
other
or
out
into
the
street
as
they
chose
susan
erskine
had
been
a
very
silent
at
this
morning
s
confusion
ruth
could
not
tell
what
she
thought
beyond
the
first
exclamation
of
surprise
she
had
expressed
no
dismay
a
little
touch
of
some
feeling
what
was
it
she
had
shown
once
when
her
mother
was
planning
and
announcing
that
she
did
not
intend
to
take
the
disease
and
if
she
did
might
as
well
as
anyone
oh
mother
susan
had
said
in
a
low
distressed
tone
full
of
suppressed
feeling
of
some
her
mother
had
turned
on
her
sharply
with
well
child
what
nothing
susan
said
as
one
who
had
checked
her
sentence
and
was
holding
herself
silent
and
thereafter
she
made
no
sign
and
so
at
last
these
two
sisters
were
stranded
in
that
deserted
library
ruth
on
her
part
gazing
blankly
out
of
the
window
watching
the
hurrying
with
a
curious
sense
of
wonderment
as
to
what
they
would
think
could
they
know
what
was
transpiring
inside
suddenly
she
turned
from
the
window
with
an
exclamation
of
thought
which
until
now
had
dropped
into
the
background
returned
to
her
there
isn
t
a
servant
in
the
house
why
what
has
become
of
them
they
fled
at
the
very
first
mention
of
the
trouble
never
was
anything
accomplished
more
rapidly
i
thought
they
had
hardly
time
to
reach
their
rooms
when
they
disappeared
around
the
is
it
possible
susan
said
after
a
moment
s
silent
contemplation
she
was
both
surprised
and
disappointed
there
was
nothing
in
her
nature
that
could
respond
to
that
method
of
bearing
one
another
s
burdens
and
she
did
not
understand
human
nature
well
enough
to
expect
developments
in
others
which
were
foreign
to
her
own
what
shall
we
do
about
dinner
ruth
asked
after
another
interval
of
silence
why
get
it
susan
answered
lightly
she
could
not
comprehend
what
an
impossible
thing
this
was
in
ruth
s
estimation
but
i
know
nothing
about
it
ruth
said
stammering
and
aghast
i
do
there
is
nothing
about
a
dinner
that
i
do
not
understand
i
is
a
reasonable
and
respectable
dinner
in
fact
i
know
how
to
do
several
things
that
are
unreasonable
i
ll
go
right
and
take
a
view
of
the
i
will
go
with
you
ruth
said
heroically
i
don
t
know
anything
about
such
matters
but
i
can
at
least
show
you
through
the
is
it
your
fortune
to
know
by
experience
just
what
a
deserted
look
a
kitchen
can
take
on
in
a
brief
space
of
time
when
the
regular
inhabitants
thereof
have
made
a
sudden
exit
just
let
the
fire
in
the
range
go
down
with
unswept
ashes
littering
the
hearth
and
unwashed
dishes
filling
the
tables
and
a
general
smell
of
departed
cookery
pervading
the
air
and
you
need
no
better
picture
of
dismalness
especially
is
this
the
case
if
you
survey
the
scene
as
ruth
did
without
being
able
to
conceive
how
it
was
possible
ever
again
to
bring
order
out
of
this
confusion
why
dear
me
said
susan
things
look
as
though
they
had
stirred
them
up
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
before
they
left
where
is
the
kept
ruth
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
ruth
said
and
she
looked
helpless
and
bewildered
well
then
i
ll
look
for
it
we
must
have
a
fire
the
first
thing
i
wonder
where
the
kindlings
are
then
she
began
to
open
little
doors
and
crannies
in
a
wise
sort
of
way
ruth
looking
on
not
knowing
that
there
were
such
places
to
search
into
both
and
kindlings
were
found
and
susan
attacked
the
range
while
ruth
took
up
a
china
cup
and
set
it
down
again
moved
a
pile
of
plates
to
the
side
of
the
table
and
moved
them
back
again
looking
utterly
dazed
and
useless
i
wonder
if
this
damper
turns
up
or
down
this
from
susan
and
her
sister
turned
and
surveyed
the
damper
with
a
grave
puzzled
air
before
she
spoke
it
is
no
sort
of
use
to
ask
me
i
never
even
examined
the
range
i
know
no
more
about
the
dampers
than
the
people
on
the
street
never
mind
said
susan
the
smoke
does
it
puffs
out
with
one
arrangement
and
goes
up
the
chimney
as
it
should
with
the
i
don
t
know
how
we
are
ever
to
do
it
ruth
said
what
make
the
fire
why
it
is
made
already
don
t
you
hear
it
roar
this
is
a
splendid
range
i
should
think
it
would
be
fun
to
cook
with
it
our
stove
was
cracked
and
one
was
broken
and
besides
it
wouldn
t
bake
on
the
bottom
the
wouldn
t
you
the
broken
susan
i
might
say
in
reminiscence
and
therefore
ruth
was
touched
why
did
you
keep
yourselves
so
poorly
provided
for
she
asked
a
flush
rising
on
her
pale
cheek
i
have
heard
your
mother
say
that
you
were
well
supplied
with
we
were
it
was
one
of
my
mother
s
whims
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
she
was
continually
troubled
with
the
feeling
that
some
day
she
or
i
often
i
might
need
all
the
money
she
could
save
and
i
never
combated
the
feeling
except
when
it
intrenched
too
closely
on
her
own
needs
she
seemed
fairly
haunted
with
the
how
absurd
said
ruth
and
her
lip
curled
as
for
susan
lips
opened
and
then
closed
partly
and
whatever
she
would
have
uttered
remains
in
oblivion
she
closed
the
damper
energetically
and
said
there
that
is
conquered
now
what
are
we
to
have
for
dinner
why
i
ordered
roast
lamb
and
its
accompaniments
ruth
said
recalling
her
minute
directions
given
to
the
skillful
cook
she
knew
how
to
dinners
but
of
course
that
is
out
of
the
why
not
at
all
if
you
would
like
it
i
know
exactly
how
to
roast
lamb
but
then
who
would
eat
it
why
stevens
and
his
friend
are
to
dine
with
us
oh
they
must
be
sent
word
not
to
come
how
we
send
who
is
there
to
go
and
ruth
the
complications
of
her
situation
pressing
upon
her
in
these
minor
details
looked
utterly
dismayed
why
judge
burnham
will
be
our
said
so
i
met
him
as
he
came
and
he
told
me
to
say
that
he
would
call
as
soon
as
he
had
attended
to
father
s
commission
and
serve
us
in
any
way
that
we
desired
we
will
have
him
first
recall
the
invitation
to
our
guests
and
then
we
will
send
him
to
the
butcher
s
the
baker
s
and
the
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
he
proved
a
very
useful
member
of
susan
was
bent
on
being
cheerful
things
are
not
so
bad
but
they
might
have
been
worse
she
had
said
almost
as
soon
as
she
was
told
of
the
trouble
mother
says
he
might
have
been
taken
sick
down
town
and
if
they
had
known
what
the
disease
was
they
wouldn
t
have
allowed
him
to
come
home
think
of
that
but
about
the
roast
lamb
she
said
do
you
think
you
and
i
could
compass
it
or
shall
we
compel
the
to
stay
and
divide
the
work
with
us
then
these
two
girls
did
what
was
perhaps
the
wisest
thing
for
them
to
do
under
the
circumstances
they
real
why
not
said
susan
he
is
not
very
sick
the
doctor
said
he
didn
t
think
he
would
be
because
he
would
be
well
taken
care
of
at
the
very
outset
and
he
will
you
may
be
sure
of
that
mother
knows
how
and
her
heart
is
in
it
you
may
trust
her
ruth
in
a
time
of
sickness
and
we
shall
manage
nicely
this
disconsolate
kitchen
shall
take
on
new
features
presently
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
right
and
be
ready
to
give
judge
burnham
his
orders
when
he
comes
he
is
real
good
and
kind
i
like
him
he
will
help
us
in
every
way
and
when
you
come
down
again
i
will
have
things
in
train
for
a
a
new
anxiety
occurred
to
ruth
do
you
know
how
to
prepare
food
for
sick
people
she
asked
indeed
i
do
the
most
appetizing
little
dishes
that
you
can
imagine
i
ve
always
thought
i
had
a
special
talent
in
that
direction
we
will
waylay
the
doctor
the
very
next
time
he
comes
and
find
out
what
he
will
allow
and
then
i
ll
cook
it
and
you
must
arrange
it
daintily
with
silver
and
china
and
flowers
you
know
they
will
let
us
have
all
sorts
of
nice
things
up
there
for
a
while
and
i
think
that
is
the
real
secret
of
serving
an
invalid
having
everything
arranged
tastefully
and
ruth
turned
toward
her
sister
with
a
very
tender
smile
on
her
face
she
realized
that
there
had
been
an
effort
to
make
her
feel
that
she
was
in
a
position
to
do
an
important
service
for
her
father
and
the
thoughtfulness
of
the
effort
touched
her
chapter
xiii
looking
for
an
easy
yoke
weary
days
now
in
store
for
ruth
more
weary
and
dispiriting
than
she
had
imagined
were
possible
to
endure
it
was
such
a
strange
experience
to
stand
at
the
window
and
watch
hurrying
out
of
the
neighborhood
of
the
house
crossing
the
street
at
most
inconvenient
points
to
avoid
a
nearer
contact
it
was
so
strange
to
have
day
after
day
pass
and
never
hear
the
sound
of
the
see
the
face
of
a
receive
an
invitation
in
short
it
was
a
sudden
shutting
out
of
the
world
in
which
she
had
always
lived
and
a
shutting
down
into
one
narrow
circle
which
repeated
itself
almost
exactly
every
hours
she
and
susan
must
needs
be
companions
now
whether
they
would
or
not
they
must
sit
down
together
three
times
a
day
at
table
and
go
through
the
forms
of
so
repulsive
a
proceeding
by
the
way
as
it
had
seemed
to
ruth
it
must
of
necessity
be
with
no
one
to
serve
susan
had
reduced
the
matter
to
a
system
and
produced
as
if
by
magic
the
most
appetizing
dishes
served
in
faultless
style
and
when
the
strangeness
of
sitting
opposite
each
other
and
having
no
one
to
look
at
or
talk
to
but
themselves
began
to
wear
away
they
found
it
a
not
unpleasant
break
in
the
day
s
monotony
to
talk
together
while
they
waited
on
each
other
then
there
was
the
sick
man
s
food
to
prepare
and
susan
exhausted
her
skill
and
ruth
contributed
of
her
taste
in
graceful
adornings
judge
erskine
still
adhered
to
his
resolution
not
to
allow
his
daughter
to
visit
him
so
all
that
could
be
done
for
his
comfort
must
be
but
this
little
was
a
great
relief
to
heart
and
brain
then
there
was
judge
burnham
a
source
of
continual
comfort
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
of
all
the
large
circle
of
friends
who
failed
to
shun
the
stricken
house
he
was
entirely
free
from
fear
and
came
and
went
at
all
hours
and
on
all
possible
in
general
and
unfailing
friend
not
a
day
passed
in
which
he
did
not
make
half
a
dozen
calls
and
every
evening
found
him
an
inmate
of
the
quiet
parlor
with
a
new
book
or
poem
or
perhaps
only
a
fresh
bouquet
of
blossoms
for
the
sisters
apparently
his
tokens
of
friendship
and
care
were
bestowed
jointly
on
not
choosing
between
them
by
a
still
despite
all
the
alleviating
circumstances
the
way
was
weary
and
the
time
hung
with
increased
heaviness
on
their
hours
of
daylight
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
settle
to
and
in
which
there
was
as
effectually
nowhere
to
go
as
if
they
were
held
in
by
bolts
and
bars
if
we
were
either
of
us
fond
of
fancy
work
i
believe
it
would
be
some
relief
ruth
said
wearily
one
afternoon
as
she
closed
her
book
after
pronouncing
it
hopelessly
dull
flossy
shipley
could
spend
days
in
making
cunning
little
worsted
dogs
with
curly
tails
and
if
there
really
were
nothing
else
that
she
felt
she
ought
to
do
i
believe
she
could
be
quite
happy
in
that
susan
laughed
one
of
us
ought
to
have
developed
that
talent
perhaps
she
said
brightly
i
don
t
know
why
you
didn
t
as
for
myself
i
never
had
the
time
and
if
i
had
the
materials
would
have
been
beyond
my
purse
but
i
like
pretty
things
i
have
really
often
wished
that
i
knew
how
to
make
some
you
don
t
know
how
to
teach
me
i
suppose
no
indeed
and
if
i
did
i
m
afraid
i
shouldn
t
do
it
nothing
ever
seemed
more
utterly
insipid
to
me
though
of
course
i
never
planned
any
such
life
as
we
are
having
look
here
susan
said
turning
suddenly
toward
her
sister
and
dropping
the
paper
which
she
had
been
reading
i
have
a
pleasant
thought
we
are
almost
tired
of
all
sorts
of
books
but
there
is
one
book
which
never
wears
out
what
if
this
time
of
absolute
and
enforced
leisure
should
have
been
given
us
in
which
to
get
better
acquainted
with
what
it
says
what
if
you
and
i
should
begin
to
study
the
bible
together
ruth
looked
gloomy
i
don
t
know
much
about
the
bible
she
said
and
i
don
t
know
how
to
study
it
i
read
a
chapter
every
day
and
of
course
i
get
some
help
out
of
it
but
i
see
so
much
that
i
don
t
understand
to
be
frank
so
much
that
it
seems
to
me
strange
should
have
been
put
into
the
book
at
all
when
necessarily
a
great
deal
that
we
would
like
to
know
was
left
out
that
it
worries
and
disappoints
she
half
expected
to
shock
susan
and
looked
toward
her
with
determined
eyes
ready
to
sustain
her
position
in
case
an
argument
was
produced
but
susan
only
answered
with
a
i
know
i
used
to
feel
very
much
in
the
same
way
until
i
had
a
light
given
me
to
go
by
which
shone
upon
some
of
the
verses
that
had
been
so
dark
there
was
no
lighting
up
of
ruth
s
face
i
know
what
you
mean
she
said
gravely
you
mean
that
the
bible
was
a
new
book
to
you
after
you
were
converted
i
have
heard
a
great
many
people
say
that
but
it
doesn
t
help
me
as
much
as
you
might
suppose
it
would
of
course
it
made
a
new
book
for
because
the
bible
was
never
anything
to
me
at
all
until
i
was
converted
i
have
passed
years
without
looking
into
it
indeed
i
may
say
i
read
it
when
i
was
a
i
used
to
find
extracts
from
it
in
my
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
me
very
lofty
sentiments
and
several
of
them
i
committed
to
memory
because
of
the
beauty
of
their
construction
but
that
was
the
extent
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
book
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
a
christian
say
after
i
was
converted
was
about
the
a
wonderful
book
it
was
to
him
and
how
every
time
he
read
a
verse
it
opened
a
new
idea
i
thought
it
would
be
that
way
with
me
but
it
hasn
t
been
i
love
the
bible
that
is
i
love
certain
things
which
i
find
in
it
but
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
as
i
thought
it
would
i
can
t
say
that
i
love
to
study
it
or
rather
perhaps
i
might
say
i
don
t
know
how
to
study
it
i
can
memorize
verses
of
course
and
i
do
somewhat
when
i
find
one
that
pleases
me
i
never
told
anyone
about
it
but
it
has
disappointed
me
a
she
had
shocked
susan
anyway
she
felt
sure
of
it
she
had
lived
long
enough
even
now
with
this
plain
quiet
sister
to
have
discovered
that
the
bible
was
a
great
fountain
of
help
to
her
she
would
not
be
able
to
understand
why
it
was
not
the
same
to
ruth
neither
did
ruth
understand
it
and
though
perhaps
she
did
not
realize
even
this
it
was
an
undertone
of
longing
to
get
at
the
secret
of
the
difference
between
them
which
prompted
her
words
but
susan
only
smiled
in
a
quiet
unsurprised
way
and
said
i
understand
you
perfectly
i
have
been
over
the
same
but
you
are
not
there
now
oh
no
i
am
and
you
learned
to
love
the
bible
by
studying
it
well
that
was
the
means
of
course
but
my
real
help
was
the
revelation
which
god
gave
me
of
himself
through
the
no
face
could
look
blanker
and
gloomier
than
ruth
s
she
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
commenced
again
her
voice
having
taken
on
a
certain
dogged
resoluteness
of
tone
as
one
who
thought
i
say
i
don
t
know
why
i
am
talking
in
this
way
to
you
it
is
not
natural
for
me
to
be
communicative
to
any
person
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
my
religion
has
been
a
disappointment
to
me
it
is
not
what
i
thought
it
was
i
expected
to
live
such
a
different
life
from
any
that
i
had
lived
before
i
expected
to
be
earnest
and
successful
and
happy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
no
way
was
ever
more
beset
with
difficulties
than
mine
has
been
when
i
really
wanted
to
do
right
and
tried
i
was
apparently
as
powerless
as
though
i
didn
t
care
i
expected
to
be
unselfish
and
i
am
just
as
selfish
so
far
as
i
can
see
as
i
ever
was
i
struggle
with
the
feeling
and
pray
over
it
but
it
is
there
just
the
same
if
for
one
half
hour
i
succeed
in
overcoming
it
i
find
it
present
with
me
the
next
hour
in
stronger
force
than
before
it
is
all
a
disappointment
i
knew
the
christian
life
was
a
warfare
but
someway
i
expected
more
to
it
than
there
is
i
expected
peace
out
of
it
and
i
haven
t
got
it
i
have
had
my
seasons
of
thinking
the
whole
thing
a
delusion
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
i
can
not
believe
that
because
in
some
respects
i
feel
a
decided
change
i
believe
i
belong
to
christ
but
i
do
so
shrink
from
the
struggles
and
trials
and
disappointments
of
this
world
i
feel
just
as
though
i
wanted
to
shirk
them
all
sometimes
i
think
if
he
take
me
to
heaven
where
i
could
rest
i
would
be
grateful
and
the
hardness
had
gone
out
of
her
face
now
and
the
tears
were
dropping
silently
on
her
closed
book
poor
girl
said
susan
tenderly
poor
tired
heart
don
t
you
think
that
the
lord
jesus
can
rest
you
anywhere
except
by
the
way
of
the
grave
that
is
such
a
mistake
and
i
made
it
for
so
long
that
i
know
all
about
it
don
t
you
hear
his
voice
calling
to
you
to
come
and
rest
in
him
this
minute
i
don
t
understand
you
i
resting
in
him
that
is
i
feel
sure
at
times
i
feel
sure
now
that
he
has
prepared
a
place
in
heaven
for
me
and
will
take
me
there
as
he
says
but
i
am
so
tired
of
the
road
i
want
to
drop
out
from
it
now
and
be
at
haven
t
you
found
his
yoke
easy
and
his
burden
light
then
no
i
haven
t
i
know
it
is
my
own
fault
but
that
doesn
t
alter
the
fact
or
relieve
the
then
do
you
believe
that
he
made
a
mistake
when
he
said
the
yoke
was
easy
ruth
arrested
her
tears
to
look
up
in
wonder
of
course
not
she
said
quickly
i
know
it
is
owing
to
myself
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
remedy
it
there
are
those
who
find
the
statement
meets
their
experience
i
don
t
doubt
but
it
seems
not
to
be
for
but
if
that
is
so
don
t
you
think
he
ought
to
have
said
some
of
you
will
find
the
burden
light
but
others
of
you
will
have
to
struggle
and
flounder
in
the
dark
you
know
he
hasn
t
qualified
it
at
all
he
said
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
take
my
yoke
upon
you
for
it
is
and
he
said
it
to
all
who
are
heavy
well
said
ruth
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
suppose
that
means
his
promise
to
save
the
soul
eternally
i
believe
he
has
done
that
for
but
is
that
all
he
is
able
or
willing
to
do
if
he
can
save
the
soul
eternally
can
not
he
give
it
peace
and
rest
here
why
of
course
he
could
if
it
were
his
will
but
i
don
t
know
that
he
has
ever
promised
to
do
don
t
you
do
you
suppose
he
who
hates
sin
has
made
us
so
that
we
can
not
keep
from
constantly
grieving
him
by
falling
into
sin
and
has
promised
us
no
help
from
the
burden
until
we
get
to
heaven
i
don
t
think
that
would
be
entire
what
you
mean
ruth
asked
turning
a
full
wondering
gaze
on
her
sister
you
surely
don
t
believe
that
people
are
perfect
in
this
world
pass
that
thought
just
now
will
you
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean
i
found
my
besetting
sin
to
be
to
yield
to
constant
fits
of
it
took
almost
nothing
to
rouse
me
and
the
more
i
struggled
and
tossed
about
in
my
effort
to
better
the
worse
it
seemed
to
me
i
became
if
i
was
to
depend
on
progressive
goodness
as
i
supposed
when
was
i
to
begin
to
grow
a
better
state
and
when
i
succeeded
should
i
not
really
have
accomplished
my
own
rescue
from
sin
it
troubled
and
tormented
me
and
i
did
not
gain
until
i
discovered
that
there
were
certain
promises
which
with
conditions
meant
me
for
instance
there
was
one
person
who
when
i
came
in
contact
with
her
invariably
made
me
angry
for
months
i
never
held
a
conversation
with
her
that
i
did
not
say
words
which
seemed
to
me
afterward
to
be
very
sinful
and
which
angered
her
this
after
i
had
prayed
and
struggled
for
one
day
i
came
across
the
promise
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
sufficient
for
what
i
asked
and
i
stopped
before
the
words
as
if
they
had
just
been
revealed
i
found
it
to
be
unlimited
as
to
quantity
or
time
it
did
not
say
after
you
have
done
the
best
you
for
years
and
gained
a
my
grace
shall
be
it
did
not
say
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
the
great
and
trying
experiences
of
this
life
but
not
for
the
little
annoyances
and
trials
which
tempt
must
look
out
for
it
was
just
an
unlimited
my
grace
is
for
my
saints
for
those
who
have
been
faithful
and
successful
but
for
having
made
that
discovery
and
felt
my
need
i
assure
you
i
was
not
long
in
claiming
my
rights
now
i
want
to
ask
you
what
that
promise
means
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
ruth
repeated
slowly
thoughtfully
then
she
paused
while
susan
waited
for
the
answer
which
came
presently
and
wondering
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
i
read
the
verse
only
yesterday
but
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
that
it
had
any
reference
to
i
don
t
know
what
i
thought
about
but
what
does
it
seem
to
you
that
it
says
christ
meant
something
by
it
of
course
what
was
it
i
don
t
know
she
said
again
thoughtfully
that
is
why
it
mean
what
it
appears
to
for
then
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
struggle
well
has
christ
ever
told
you
to
struggle
on
the
contrary
hasn
t
he
told
you
to
rest
it
seems
to
me
said
ruth
after
revolving
that
thought
or
some
other
in
silence
for
several
it
seems
to
me
that
one
who
thought
as
you
do
about
these
things
would
be
claiming
perfection
and
if
there
is
one
doctrine
above
another
that
i
despise
it
is
just
that
i
know
one
woman
who
is
always
talking
about
it
and
claiming
that
she
hasn
t
sinned
in
so
many
months
and
all
that
nonsense
and
really
she
is
the
most
disagreeable
woman
i
ever
met
in
my
look
here
said
susan
do
you
rely
on
the
lord
jesus
for
salvation
that
is
do
you
believe
you
are
a
sinner
and
could
do
nothing
for
yourself
and
he
just
had
to
come
and
do
it
for
you
and
present
your
claim
to
heaven
through
himself
why
of
course
there
is
no
other
way
i
that
i
am
a
sinner
and
i
know
it
is
wonderful
in
him
to
have
been
willing
to
save
me
but
he
well
now
aren
t
you
afraid
to
claim
that
for
fear
people
will
think
that
you
saved
yourself
i
don
t
understand
ruth
said
gravely
don
t
you
why
you
fear
to
claim
christ
s
promise
to
his
grace
is
sufficient
for
every
demand
that
you
choose
to
make
on
fear
people
will
think
you
consider
yourself
perfect
why
should
they
not
just
as
readily
think
that
because
you
relied
on
christ
for
final
salvation
therefore
you
relied
on
yourself
that
is
a
foolish
yes
isn
t
the
other
i
never
heard
anybody
talk
as
you
do
was
ruth
s
answer
i
haven
t
a
different
bible
from
yours
susan
said
smiling
you
admit
to
me
that
the
promise
about
which
we
are
talking
is
in
yours
and
you
read
it
yesterday
what
i
wonder
is
what
you
think
it
chapter
xiv
through
a
glass
the
last
was
but
the
beginning
of
many
talks
which
those
two
sisters
held
together
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
promises
which
christ
had
made
to
his
children
during
the
time
ruth
received
and
accepted
some
new
ideas
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
was
her
intellect
which
accepted
them
rather
than
her
heart
she
acknowledged
that
the
lord
had
plainly
said
his
grace
was
sufficient
for
them
and
that
having
been
tempted
he
was
able
to
succor
those
who
were
tempted
and
that
there
should
no
temptation
take
his
children
except
such
as
they
were
able
to
bear
because
the
faithful
god
would
provide
a
way
of
escape
all
these
i
say
she
admitted
they
were
plainly
written
in
his
word
and
mean
what
they
said
still
she
went
on
being
tempted
and
yielding
to
the
temptation
struggling
against
the
gloom
and
unrest
of
her
fiercely
against
the
providence
which
had
come
between
her
and
the
father
whom
she
began
to
realize
she
had
worshiped
rather
than
fighting
baffled
wounded
to
rise
up
and
struggle
afresh
all
the
while
admitting
with
her
clear
that
he
said
as
thy
day
so
shall
thy
strength
why
did
she
not
have
the
strength
she
dimly
questioned
with
herself
occasionally
the
why
she
even
deemed
herself
because
none
of
the
promised
strength
came
to
her
but
she
passed
over
the
searching
question
of
the
lord
to
his
waiting
suppliant
ye
that
i
am
able
to
do
this
had
the
lord
jesus
christ
appeared
to
ruth
in
bodily
presence
and
asked
her
this
question
she
realized
afterward
that
she
would
have
been
obliged
to
answer
oh
no
i
don
t
you
say
you
are
able
and
you
say
you
are
willing
and
i
believe
that
the
words
are
yours
and
that
you
have
all
power
in
heaven
and
earth
and
believe
that
you
will
do
it
for
to
such
strange
and
unaccountable
depths
of
absurdity
does
unbelief
lead
us
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
susan
and
she
could
not
talk
calmly
about
these
things
or
any
not
talk
at
only
weep
and
wait
and
kneel
and
dumbly
pray
and
then
wait
again
while
life
and
death
struggled
fiercely
together
for
the
victim
and
it
seemed
that
death
would
be
the
victor
many
days
passed
and
the
of
enforced
endurance
still
held
ruth
a
prisoner
and
still
she
rebelled
against
the
providence
that
had
hemmed
her
in
and
shut
her
away
from
her
father
still
she
rebelled
at
the
thought
of
the
nurse
who
bent
over
him
in
tireless
watch
long
before
all
attempts
at
securing
outside
help
had
been
abandoned
bacon
having
expressed
himself
more
than
satisfied
never
a
better
nurse
took
hold
of
a
case
he
said
emphatically
to
ruth
if
your
father
recovers
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
hopeful
he
will
owe
it
more
to
her
care
than
to
any
other
human
effort
she
seems
to
know
by
instinct
what
and
when
and
how
and
i
believe
the
woman
never
sleeps
at
all
she
is
just
as
alert
and
active
and
determined
as
she
was
the
first
hour
she
went
into
his
room
and
the
vigil
has
been
long
and
sharp
i
tell
you
what
miss
ruth
you
begin
to
understand
don
t
you
what
this
woman
was
raised
up
for
she
was
planned
for
just
such
a
time
as
this
no
money
would
have
bought
such
nursing
and
it
has
been
a
case
in
which
nursing
was
of
it
she
ought
to
be
a
nurse
this
minute
shall
i
find
a
place
for
her
when
her
services
are
not
needed
here
in
that
capacity
any
longer
she
could
command
grand
the
doctor
had
essayed
to
bring
a
smile
to
ruth
s
wan
face
but
it
was
made
evident
to
him
that
he
understood
disease
better
than
he
did
human
least
the
sort
of
human
nature
of
which
she
was
composed
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
her
tone
was
unusually
and
unnecessarily
haughty
as
she
said
you
forget
bacon
that
you
are
speaking
of
then
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
with
a
i
beg
pardon
turned
away
more
of
an
iceberg
than
ever
he
muttered
a
little
louder
as
he
went
down
the
hall
i
don
t
know
what
burnham
is
about
i
am
sure
i
hope
it
is
the
other
one
he
and
then
he
slammed
the
door
a
little
he
had
left
ruth
in
a
rage
with
him
and
with
events
and
with
her
own
heart
she
resented
his
familiarity
with
the
name
which
that
woman
bore
and
she
resented
the
fact
that
she
bore
the
name
she
was
bitterly
jealous
of
erskine
s
position
by
that
she
did
not
believe
in
her
nursing
abilities
she
knew
she
was
fussy
and
officious
and
ignorant
three
things
that
were
horrible
in
a
nurse
she
knew
her
father
must
be
a
daily
sufferer
because
of
this
she
by
no
means
saw
what
that
woman
was
raised
up
for
or
why
she
should
have
been
permitted
to
come
in
contact
with
every
day
she
chafed
more
under
it
and
the
process
made
her
grow
hard
and
cold
and
silent
to
the
woman
s
daughter
so
by
degrees
the
burden
grew
heavier
and
susan
feeling
that
no
word
of
hers
could
help
maintained
at
last
a
tender
patient
silence
that
to
ruth
s
sore
angered
heart
was
in
itself
almost
an
added
sting
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
they
drew
near
to
the
hour
when
the
question
of
life
and
death
would
be
determined
ruth
s
heart
seemed
like
to
burst
with
the
conflict
raging
in
anxiety
knew
not
what
to
call
the
burden
but
she
knew
it
was
a
she
spent
hours
in
her
own
room
resenting
all
interruptions
resenting
every
call
from
susan
to
come
down
and
take
a
little
nourishment
even
almost
disposed
to
resent
the
bulletins
for
which
she
waited
breathlessly
as
they
were
from
time
to
time
spoken
through
the
keyhole
in
susan
s
voice
he
is
no
worse
than
he
was
half
an
hour
ago
ruth
or
the
doctor
thinks
there
must
be
a
change
before
night
or
dear
ruth
he
murmured
your
name
a
little
while
ago
the
doctor
presently
ruth
came
out
of
her
room
and
down
to
the
toward
susan
sitting
in
the
little
rocker
with
her
bible
in
her
lap
and
said
speaking
in
a
low
tone
so
full
of
energy
that
in
itself
it
was
startling
susan
if
you
know
how
to
pray
at
all
kneel
down
now
and
pray
for
can
t
i
have
been
trying
for
hours
and
have
forgotten
how
to
without
a
word
of
reply
susan
arose
quickly
and
dropped
on
her
knees
ruth
kneeling
beside
her
and
then
the
words
of
prayer
which
filled
that
room
indicated
that
one
heart
at
least
knew
how
to
pray
and
felt
the
presence
of
the
comforter
pervading
her
soul
long
they
knelt
there
unwilling
it
seemed
to
rise
even
after
the
audible
prayer
ceased
and
it
was
thus
that
judge
burnham
found
them
as
with
light
quick
steps
he
crossed
the
hall
in
search
of
them
saying
as
he
entered
courage
dear
friends
the
doctor
believes
that
there
is
strong
reason
now
for
the
crisis
passed
judge
erskine
rallied
rapidly
much
more
rapidly
than
those
who
had
watched
over
him
in
the
violence
of
his
sickness
had
deemed
possible
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
a
few
more
tedious
days
of
waiting
his
room
was
opened
once
more
to
the
presence
of
his
daughter
fully
as
she
had
supposed
that
she
realized
his
illness
she
was
unprepared
for
the
change
which
it
had
wrought
and
could
hardly
suppress
a
cry
of
dismay
as
she
bent
over
him
long
afterward
she
wondered
at
herself
as
she
recalled
the
fact
that
her
first
startled
rebellious
thought
had
been
that
there
was
not
such
a
striking
contrast
now
between
him
and
his
wife
there
was
another
disappointment
in
store
for
her
she
had
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
she
might
reign
in
that
become
her
father
s
sole
nurse
in
his
convalescence
and
succeed
in
banishing
from
his
presence
that
which
must
have
become
so
unendurable
she
discovered
that
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
banish
a
wife
from
her
husband
s
erskine
was
apparently
serenely
unconscious
that
her
presence
was
undesired
by
ruth
she
came
and
went
freely
was
cheery
and
loquacious
as
usual
discoursed
on
the
dangers
through
which
judge
erskine
had
passed
and
reiterated
the
fact
that
it
was
a
mercy
she
didn
t
take
the
disease
until
actually
ruth
was
unable
to
feel
that
even
this
was
a
mercy
there
was
a
bitterer
side
to
it
her
father
had
changed
in
more
ways
than
one
it
appeared
that
his
daughter
s
unavailing
grief
for
him
in
becoming
the
victim
of
such
a
nurse
was
all
wasted
pity
he
had
not
felt
it
an
infliction
his
voice
had
taken
a
gentle
tone
in
which
there
was
almost
tenderness
when
he
spoke
to
her
his
eyes
followed
her
movements
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
restfulness
he
smiled
on
his
daughter
but
he
asked
his
wife
to
raise
his
head
and
arrange
his
pillow
how
was
this
to
be
accounted
for
how
could
a
few
short
weeks
so
change
his
feelings
and
tastes
she
a
born
nurse
ruth
admitted
looking
on
and
watching
the
cheery
skill
with
which
she
made
all
things
comfortable
who
would
have
supposed
that
she
could
be
other
than
fussy
well
all
persons
have
their
mission
if
she
could
have
filled
the
place
of
a
good
cheerful
hospital
nurse
how
i
should
have
liked
her
and
how
grateful
i
should
feel
to
her
now
and
then
she
shuddered
over
the
feeling
that
she
did
not
now
feel
toward
her
an
atom
of
gratitude
she
looked
forward
to
a
moment
when
she
could
be
left
alone
with
her
father
of
course
he
was
grateful
to
this
woman
his
nature
was
higher
than
hers
beside
he
knew
what
she
had
done
and
borne
for
him
here
in
this
of
course
he
felt
it
and
was
so
thoroughly
a
gentleman
that
he
would
show
her
by
look
and
action
that
he
appreciated
it
but
could
his
daughter
once
have
him
to
herself
for
a
little
while
what
a
relief
and
comfort
it
would
doubtless
be
to
him
even
over
this
thought
she
chafed
if
this
woman
held
the
position
in
the
house
which
would
make
it
proper
for
her
to
say
you
may
leave
us
alone
now
for
awhile
my
father
and
i
wish
to
talk
i
will
ring
when
you
are
needed
what
gracious
and
grateful
smiles
she
could
have
said
those
words
as
it
was
she
planned
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
go
to
another
room
and
try
to
get
some
rest
yes
said
judge
erskine
turning
his
head
and
looking
earnestly
at
her
if
any
human
being
ever
needed
rest
away
from
this
scene
of
confusion
i
think
you
bless
your
heart
child
with
a
little
laugh
i
ve
rested
ever
so
much
when
you
get
used
to
it
you
can
sleep
standing
up
with
a
bowl
of
gruel
in
one
hand
and
a
bottle
of
hot
water
in
the
other
ready
for
action
just
as
soon
as
the
anxiety
was
off
i
got
rest
and
while
i
was
anxious
you
know
i
lived
on
about
as
well
as
sleep
for
keeping
up
strength
i
guess
you
tried
it
yourself
by
the
looks
of
your
white
cheeks
and
great
big
eyes
land
alive
i
never
see
them
look
so
big
did
you
judge
but
susan
says
you
behaved
like
a
soldier
well
i
knew
you
would
i
says
to
myself
says
i
she
is
made
of
the
stuff
that
will
bear
it
and
do
her
best
and
it
give
me
strength
to
do
my
best
for
your
pa
cause
i
knew
you
was
depending
on
me
says
i
i
ve
got
two
sides
to
this
responsibility
now
there
s
the
judge
lying
helpless
and
knowing
that
every
single
thing
that
s
done
for
him
for
the
next
month
or
so
must
come
through
me
and
there
s
his
daughter
trusting
to
me
to
bring
him
through
and
i
did
my
level
and
then
ruth
shuddered
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
feel
anything
but
repulsion
at
last
to
her
rescue
she
had
imperative
need
for
mother
in
the
kitchen
for
a
few
minutes
ruth
watched
eagerly
as
she
waddled
away
until
the
door
closed
after
her
then
turned
with
hungry
eyes
toward
her
father
ready
to
pour
out
her
soul
as
she
never
had
done
before
his
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
door
and
he
said
as
the
retreating
footsteps
were
lost
to
them
if
you
have
joy
in
your
heart
i
know
you
the
restoration
of
your
father
you
owe
it
under
god
to
that
woman
i
never
even
imagined
anything
like
the
utter
that
she
showed
disease
in
its
most
repulsive
most
loathsome
form
held
me
in
its
grasp
until
i
know
well
i
looked
less
like
a
human
being
than
i
did
like
some
hideous
wild
animal
why
i
have
seen
even
the
doctor
start
back
overcome
for
a
moment
by
the
sight
but
she
never
started
back
nor
faltered
in
her
patient
persistent
tender
care
through
it
all
we
both
owe
her
our
gratitude
and
our
love
my
do
you
know
ruth
well
enough
to
understand
that
she
poured
out
no
tide
of
tenderness
upon
her
father
after
that
she
retired
into
her
old
silent
self
to
such
a
degree
that
the
father
looked
at
her
wonderingly
at
first
then
half
wearily
and
turned
his
head
and
closed
his
eyes
that
he
might
rest
since
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
it
was
two
or
three
days
afterward
that
she
tried
again
in
the
meantime
she
had
chided
herself
sharply
for
her
folly
why
had
she
allowed
herself
to
be
so
apparently
her
heart
was
so
full
of
love
was
she
really
so
demoralized
she
asked
herself
that
she
would
have
her
father
other
than
grateful
for
the
care
which
had
been
bestowed
of
he
was
grateful
and
of
course
he
desired
to
show
it
as
any
noble
nature
should
after
all
what
had
he
said
but
that
they
both
owed
her
a
debt
of
gratitude
and
love
so
we
do
said
ruth
sturdily
i
should
love
a
dog
who
had
been
kind
to
and
then
she
suppressed
an
almost
groan
over
the
startling
thought
that
if
this
woman
had
been
a
she
could
have
loved
but
she
was
left
alone
with
her
father
again
he
had
advanced
to
the
stage
and
she
was
to
sit
with
him
and
amuse
him
while
erskine
attended
to
some
outside
matter
ruth
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
so
that
she
went
away
she
was
tender
and
thoughtful
shading
her
father
s
weakened
eyes
from
the
light
picking
up
his
dropped
handkerchief
doing
a
dozen
little
nothings
for
him
and
occasionally
speaking
some
tender
word
he
was
not
disposed
to
talk
much
beyond
asking
a
few
general
questions
as
to
what
had
transpired
during
his
absence
from
the
world
then
presently
he
broke
an
interval
of
silence
during
which
he
had
sat
with
closed
eyes
by
asking
where
is
susan
susan
his
daughter
repeated
half
startled
why
she
is
in
the
kitchen
i
presume
she
generally
is
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
she
has
had
to
be
housekeeper
and
cook
and
i
hardly
know
what
not
during
these
queer
days
she
has
filled
all
the
posts
splendidly
i
don
t
know
what
you
would
have
eaten
but
for
here
ruth
paused
a
moment
to
be
gratified
over
her
own
advance
in
goodness
at
least
she
could
speak
freely
and
in
praise
of
susan
then
she
said
do
you
want
anything
father
that
susan
can
get
for
you
he
unclosed
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
with
a
full
meaning
smile
as
he
said
slowly
i
was
not
thinking
of
susan
my
dear
i
meant
my
wife
you
may
call
her
if
you
will
i
feel
somewhat
tired
and
she
knows
just
how
to
fix
me
for
imagine
ruth
erskine
going
down
the
hall
down
the
stairs
through
the
library
out
through
the
back
hall
away
to
the
and
saying
to
judge
erskine
in
a
low
tone
father
wants
you
ma
am
bless
his
heart
said
erskine
dropping
the
pile
of
fresh
linen
she
was
fumbling
in
i
hope
he
hasn
t
been
fretty
cause
i
staid
so
long
then
she
fled
up
the
stairs
well
you
are
not
very
well
versed
in
the
knowledge
of
the
depths
of
the
human
heart
if
you
need
to
be
told
that
this
last
experience
was
the
bitterest
drop
in
ruth
s
cup
of
trouble
hitherto
it
had
been
her
father
and
herself
bearing
together
a
common
trial
now
she
felt
that
someway
she
had
lost
her
father
and
gained
she
had
sunken
in
her
own
estimation
and
that
she
was
alone
chapter
xv
rests
it
took
some
time
for
the
erskines
to
find
their
way
back
into
the
it
took
the
world
many
weeks
to
be
willing
to
receive
them
what
was
reasonable
caution
at
first
became
not
only
annoying
but
ludicrous
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
suggested
that
all
possibility
of
danger
from
contact
with
them
was
past
there
were
those
who
believe
that
it
would
ever
be
safe
to
call
on
them
again
ruth
on
her
part
did
not
worry
over
this
but
suggested
coldly
that
it
would
be
an
almost
infinite
relief
if
of
their
calling
acquaintances
would
continue
frightened
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
the
domestic
world
it
made
more
trouble
army
of
were
marshaled
to
and
from
intelligence
offices
looked
askance
at
the
doors
and
windows
as
if
they
half
expected
the
demon
of
to
take
visible
shape
and
pounce
upon
them
and
it
was
found
to
be
only
the
worst
and
most
hopeless
characters
who
had
ventured
into
doubtful
quarters
so
that
for
days
susan
was
engaged
in
skirmishes
between
girls
who
professed
everything
and
knew
nothing
ruth
had
long
before
retired
vanquished
from
this
portion
of
the
field
and
agreed
that
her
forte
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
where
it
lies
she
said
aloud
and
gloomily
but
she
was
in
her
own
room
and
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
no
other
listener
than
the
against
which
her
brown
head
wearily
leaned
she
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
where
she
was
willing
to
confess
her
disappointment
at
life
to
anybody
else
but
in
truth
it
seemed
that
the
world
was
too
small
for
her
she
was
not
needed
at
home
nor
elsewhere
so
far
as
she
could
see
her
father
as
he
relapsed
into
old
duties
did
not
seek
his
former
confidential
footing
with
her
indeed
he
seemed
rather
to
avoid
it
as
one
who
might
fear
lest
his
own
peace
would
be
shaken
so
ruth
thought
at
first
but
one
little
private
talk
with
him
had
dispelled
the
probability
of
that
i
want
to
tell
you
something
daughter
he
had
said
to
her
when
they
were
left
alone
in
the
library
the
first
day
of
his
return
to
at
least
i
owe
it
to
you
to
tell
you
something
i
waited
until
i
had
really
gotten
back
into
the
world
again
because
of
a
half
recognized
fear
which
i
see
now
was
cowardly
and
faithless
that
old
scenes
would
recall
old
feelings
i
had
an
experience
my
daughter
during
those
first
few
days
when
the
lord
shut
me
out
from
you
all
my
christian
faith
did
not
sustain
me
as
it
ought
to
have
done
i
mean
by
that
that
it
was
not
the
sort
of
faith
which
it
ought
to
have
been
i
rebelled
at
the
fierceness
of
the
fire
in
which
i
had
been
placed
i
felt
that
i
could
not
bear
it
that
it
was
cruel
and
bitter
most
of
all
i
rebelled
at
the
presence
of
my
wife
i
felt
that
it
was
too
much
to
be
shut
away
from
everything
that
life
holds
dear
and
to
be
shut
up
with
that
which
had
hitherto
made
life
miserable
i
can
not
tell
you
of
the
struggle
of
the
hopeless
beatings
of
my
bruised
head
against
the
bars
of
its
cage
it
almost
unmans
me
even
to
think
of
those
and
judge
erskine
paused
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
i
will
just
hurry
over
the
details
he
said
at
last
there
came
an
hour
when
i
began
to
dimly
comprehend
that
my
redeemer
was
only
answering
some
of
the
agonizing
prayers
that
i
had
of
late
been
constantly
putting
up
to
him
i
had
prayed
ruth
for
strength
to
do
my
whole
duty
and
in
order
to
do
it
i
plainly
saw
that
i
must
feel
differently
from
what
i
had
been
feeling
that
i
must
get
over
this
shrinking
from
a
relation
which
i
deliberately
brought
upon
myself
and
one
which
i
was
bound
by
solemn
covenant
to
sustain
i
must
have
help
i
must
submit
not
only
but
i
must
learn
to
be
pitiful
toward
and
patient
with
and
yet
how
i
christ
showed
me
how
he
let
me
see
such
a
revelation
of
my
own
selfishness
and
hardness
and
pride
as
made
me
abhor
myself
in
dust
and
ashes
and
then
he
let
me
see
such
a
revelation
of
human
patience
and
tenderness
and
as
filled
me
with
gratitude
and
respect
ruth
he
has
given
me
much
more
than
i
asked
i
prayed
for
patience
and
tenderness
and
he
gave
me
not
only
those
but
such
a
feeling
of
respect
for
one
who
could
so
entirely
forget
herself
and
do
for
another
what
my
wife
did
for
me
that
i
feel
able
to
cherish
her
all
the
rest
of
my
life
in
short
daughter
i
feel
that
i
could
take
even
the
vows
of
the
upon
my
lips
now
and
mean
them
in
all
simplicity
and
singleness
of
heart
and
having
taken
them
long
ago
i
ratify
them
now
and
mean
to
live
by
them
as
long
as
life
lasts
to
us
both
so
help
me
god
in
all
this
i
do
not
forget
the
sin
nor
the
suffering
which
that
sin
has
entailed
upon
you
my
dear
precious
daughter
but
i
feel
that
i
must
do
what
i
can
to
atone
for
it
and
that
shirking
my
duty
as
i
have
been
doing
in
the
past
does
not
help
you
to
bear
your
part
i
know
you
have
forgiven
me
ruth
and
i
know
that
god
has
he
has
done
more
than
that
in
his
infinite
love
and
compassion
he
has
made
the
cross
a
comfort
and
now
daughter
i
never
wish
to
speak
of
this
matter
again
you
asked
me
once
if
i
wished
you
to
call
her
mother
i
have
no
desire
to
force
your
lips
to
what
they
do
not
mean
nor
to
oblige
you
to
bear
any
more
cross
for
your
father
than
the
sin
has
in
itself
laid
upon
you
but
if
at
any
time
in
your
future
life
you
feel
that
you
care
to
say
mother
it
will
be
a
pleasant
sound
to
my
ruth
reflected
afterward
with
a
sense
of
thankfulness
that
she
had
grace
enough
left
to
bend
forward
and
kiss
her
father
s
white
forehead
and
pass
her
hand
tenderly
over
the
moist
locks
of
gray
hair
above
his
temples
then
she
went
out
and
went
away
she
could
have
spoken
no
word
just
then
she
was
struggling
with
two
conflicting
feelings
in
her
soul
she
was
glad
for
her
father
that
he
had
got
help
and
that
his
heavy
cross
was
growing
into
peace
but
all
the
felt
now
and
felt
with
a
dull
aching
at
her
heart
which
refused
to
be
comforted
that
she
herself
had
not
found
peace
in
it
that
it
was
if
anything
more
bitter
than
ever
and
that
she
had
lost
her
father
is
it
any
wonder
that
life
to
her
stretched
out
gloomily
many
changes
had
taken
place
during
their
enforced
exile
from
the
world
eurie
mitchell
had
married
and
gone
and
flossy
shipley
had
married
and
gone
both
of
them
to
new
homes
and
new
friends
and
both
of
them
had
by
their
departure
made
great
gulfs
in
ruth
s
life
they
had
written
her
characteristic
notes
along
with
their
wedding
cards
eurie
s
ran
thus
fancy
you
bearing
it
like
a
martyr
as
i
know
you
can
i
always
said
you
would
make
a
magnificent
martyr
but
i
am
so
sorry
that
the
experiment
has
come
in
such
a
shape
that
we
can
t
look
on
and
watch
its
becomingness
also
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
can
not
be
present
to
see
me
stand
up
in
the
great
big
church
without
any
bonnet
which
is
the
way
in
which
our
baby
characterizes
the
ceremony
in
fact
i
am
almost
as
sorry
about
that
as
i
am
that
father
should
have
been
out
of
town
during
the
first
few
days
of
judge
erskine
s
illness
and
so
given
that
bacon
a
chance
to
be
installed
father
doesn
t
happen
to
agree
with
him
on
some
points
and
the
care
of
patients
is
one
thing
in
which
they
totally
differ
however
your
father
is
going
on
finely
so
far
i
hear
and
you
know
my
dear
that
bacon
celebrated
so
be
as
brave
as
you
can
and
it
will
all
come
out
right
i
dare
say
in
fact
we
it
will
isn
t
that
a
comfort
there
are
ever
so
many
things
that
i
might
say
if
i
could
but
you
know
i
was
never
able
to
put
my
heart
on
paper
so
imagine
some
of
the
which
beat
for
you
while
i
sign
myself
for
the
last
time
eurie
ruth
laughed
over
this
note
it
is
so
exactly
like
her
she
murmured
i
wonder
if
she
will
ever
tone
down
flossy
s
was
smaller
daintier
delicately
perfumed
with
the
faintest
touch
of
violets
and
read
precious
the
eternal
god
is
thy
refuge
and
underneath
are
the
everlasting
how
safe
you
are
oh
thou
afflicted
tossed
with
tempest
and
not
comforted
behold
i
will
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colors
with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
on
thee
saith
the
lord
thy
blessed
jesus
do
for
ruth
as
thou
hast
this
is
flossy
shipley
s
prayer
for
her
dear
friend
whom
she
will
love
and
cherish
over
this
note
ruth
shed
hot
tears
she
was
touched
and
comforted
and
saddened
she
realized
more
than
ever
before
what
a
spiritual
loss
flossy
s
going
was
to
be
to
her
and
she
did
not
come
closer
to
the
one
who
would
have
made
amends
for
all
losses
perhaps
she
had
never
felt
the
dreariness
of
her
existence
more
than
she
did
on
a
certain
evening
some
weeks
after
the
household
had
settled
into
its
accustomed
routine
of
life
which
was
like
and
yet
utterly
unlike
what
that
life
had
been
before
the
invasion
of
disease
it
was
dark
outside
and
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
there
was
little
chance
of
relief
from
monotony
by
the
arrival
of
guests
ruth
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
library
in
search
of
a
book
that
she
felt
willing
to
read
and
finding
none
turned
at
last
to
the
where
judge
erskine
and
his
wife
were
sitting
secure
in
the
prospect
of
rain
and
therefore
seclusion
he
had
arrayed
himself
in
and
slippers
and
was
resting
his
scarred
seamed
face
among
the
cushions
of
the
enjoying
a
luxury
which
was
none
other
than
that
of
having
his
gray
hair
carefully
and
steadily
brushed
the
brush
passing
with
the
regularity
of
a
sentinel
on
its
slow
soothing
track
guided
by
his
wife
s
hand
while
judge
erskine
s
face
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
reposeful
rest
there
was
that
in
the
scene
which
irritated
ruth
almost
beyond
control
she
passed
quickly
through
the
room
into
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
alcove
which
was
curtained
off
from
the
main
room
and
afforded
a
retreat
for
the
piano
and
a
pretext
for
any
one
who
desired
to
use
it
and
be
alone
it
was
not
that
had
ever
waited
thus
upon
her
father
she
had
never
thought
of
approaching
him
in
this
familiar
way
even
had
she
dared
to
do
so
their
was
after
all
so
utterly
dissimilar
that
what
was
evidently
a
sedative
to
him
would
have
driven
his
daughter
fairly
wild
to
have
any
one
however
dear
and
familiar
touch
her
hair
draw
a
brush
through
it
would
have
irritated
her
nerves
in
her
best
days
she
thought
of
it
then
as
she
sat
down
in
the
first
seat
that
she
reached
after
the
friendly
crimson
curtains
hid
her
from
those
with
her
chin
resting
in
her
two
listless
hands
and
tried
to
wonder
what
she
should
do
if
she
were
forced
to
lie
among
the
cushions
of
that
in
there
and
have
woman
brush
her
hair
i
should
choke
her
i
know
i
should
she
said
with
sudden
fierceness
and
then
with
scarcely
less
fierceness
of
tone
and
manner
added
i
hope
it
will
never
be
my
awful
fate
to
have
to
be
taken
care
of
by
her
or
to
have
to
endure
the
sight
of
her
presence
about
any
one
i
love
oh
what
is
the
matter
with
me
i
grow
wicked
every
hour
what
become
of
me
after
all
there
were
those
who
were
not
afraid
of
the
rain
and
were
not
to
be
kept
from
their
purposes
by
it
ruth
listened
indifferently
at
first
then
with
a
touch
of
eagerness
to
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
the
tones
in
the
hall
and
then
to
the
sound
of
judge
burnham
s
step
as
he
was
being
shown
to
the
the
new
help
had
been
in
the
house
just
long
enough
to
discover
that
he
was
a
privileged
and
unceremonious
guest
ah
he
said
pausing
in
the
doorway
am
i
disturbing
sick
judge
come
in
said
judge
erskine
s
hearty
voice
no
i
am
not
sick
only
dreadfully
lazy
and
being
petted
when
i
was
a
boy
and
mother
used
to
brush
my
hair
nothing
soothed
and
rested
me
so
much
and
i
find
i
haven
t
lost
the
old
habit
have
a
chair
and
tell
us
the
evening
news
i
haven
t
been
out
of
the
house
since
nothing
specially
new
said
judge
burnham
dropping
into
an
and
looking
around
him
inquiringly
where
are
the
ladies
why
said
erskine
brushing
away
steadily
susan
is
in
the
kitchen
she
mostly
is
these
days
such
a
time
as
we
are
having
with
servants
i
wonder
she
don
t
get
sick
of
the
whole
set
and
tell
them
to
tramp
just
now
though
she
has
got
hold
of
one
who
seems
willing
enough
to
learn
and
susan
heard
her
pa
say
this
noon
that
he
believed
he
would
like
some
muffins
once
more
so
she
is
down
there
trying
to
teach
mollie
about
setting
muffins
and
beating
of
it
into
her
to
let
them
alone
in
the
morning
till
gets
down
to
tend
to
why
said
judge
erskine
in
a
tone
of
tenderness
that
jarred
ruth
s
ears
i
wonder
if
she
is
attending
to
that
what
a
child
she
is
she
will
wear
herself
out
waiting
on
there
ain
t
a
selfish
streak
about
her
erskine
said
complacently
nor
never
was
but
la
you
needn
t
fret
about
her
judge
she
loves
to
do
it
she
went
down
in
the
first
place
to
tend
to
that
but
she
has
got
another
string
to
her
bow
now
she
found
out
that
mollie
didn
t
know
how
to
read
writing
and
had
a
letter
from
her
mother
that
she
couldn
t
make
out
so
susan
read
it
to
her
and
the
next
thing
was
to
write
her
an
answer
and
she
is
at
that
and
where
is
miss
ruth
questioned
judge
burnham
the
instant
this
long
sentence
was
concluded
why
she
is
s
the
best
name
i
know
for
it
she
is
back
there
in
the
alcove
i
thought
she
went
to
play
but
she
hasn
t
played
a
note
that
child
needs
a
change
i
m
just
that
worried
about
her
that
her
white
face
haunts
me
nights
when
i
m
trying
to
sleep
she
has
had
an
awful
hard
siege
her
pa
so
sick
and
she
obliged
to
keep
away
from
him
and
not
being
sure
whether
i
knew
more
than
a
turnip
about
taking
care
of
wonder
how
she
stood
it
and
i
m
just
afraid
she
will
break
down
yet
she
needs
something
to
rest
her
up
and
give
her
some
color
in
her
cheeks
i
keep
telling
her
pa
that
he
ought
to
do
suppose
i
go
and
help
her
mope
judge
burnham
said
rising
in
the
midst
of
a
flow
of
words
and
speedily
making
his
way
behind
the
red
curtains
he
came
over
to
ruth
holding
out
both
hands
to
greet
her
how
do
you
do
he
said
and
there
was
tender
inquiry
in
the
tone
you
didn
t
know
i
was
in
town
did
you
i
came
two
days
sooner
than
i
had
i
didn
t
know
you
were
out
of
town
said
ruth
i
thought
you
had
deserted
us
like
the
rest
of
our
so
you
didn
t
get
my
note
he
asked
looking
blank
well
never
mind
it
was
merely
an
explanation
of
an
absence
which
i
hoped
you
might
notice
erskine
says
you
are
moping
ruth
is
it
true
she
says
you
need
a
change
and
something
to
rest
you
up
i
wish
you
would
let
me
give
you
a
change
don
t
you
think
you
could
a
change
ruth
repeated
with
a
little
laugh
and
there
was
color
enough
in
her
cheeks
just
then
why
should
need
a
change
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
a
great
deal
i
want
to
give
you
such
a
change
as
will
affect
all
your
future
life
and
mine
i
would
like
to
have
you
change
name
and
home
oh
ruth
i
would
like
to
devote
my
life
to
the
business
of
resting
you
don
t
you
believe
i
can
do
it
now
i
am
sure
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
give
you
ruth
erskine
s
answer
you
probably
understand
what
it
was
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
understand
her
better
than
she
did
herself
up
to
this
very
moment
she
actually
had
not
realized
what
made
up
the
bulk
of
her
unrest
this
week
no
not
the
bulk
either
there
were
graver
questions
even
than
this
one
which
might
well
disturb
her
but
she
had
not
understood
her
own
footing
with
judge
burnham
nor
had
scarcely
a
conception
of
his
feelings
toward
her
the
low
murmur
of
talk
went
on
after
a
little
behind
the
red
curtains
and
continued
long
after
judge
erskine
and
his
wife
went
just
as
he
was
turning
out
the
gas
in
their
that
gentleman
said
unless
i
am
mistaken
judge
burnham
would
like
to
give
ruth
a
decided
land
alive
said
erskine
taking
in
his
meaning
after
a
little
i
declare
now
you
speak
of
it
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
then
she
added
kindly
genuinely
and
i
m
sure
i
hope
it
s
true
i
tell
you
that
child
needs
resting
chapter
xvi
shadowed
joys
one
of
the
first
experiences
connected
with
ruth
s
new
life
was
a
surprise
and
a
trial
she
did
not
act
in
the
matter
as
almost
any
other
young
lady
would
have
done
indeed
perhaps
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
it
was
not
her
to
act
as
most
others
would
in
like
circumstances
she
kept
the
story
an
entire
secret
with
her
own
heart
not
even
her
father
suspected
that
matters
were
settled
perhaps
though
this
last
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
judge
burnham
went
away
again
on
business
by
the
early
train
the
morning
after
he
had
arranged
for
ruth
s
change
of
home
and
name
and
did
not
return
again
for
a
week
during
that
week
as
i
say
ruth
hugged
her
new
joy
and
kept
her
own
counsel
yet
it
was
her
heart
was
in
this
matter
strangely
enough
it
had
been
a
surprise
to
her
she
had
understood
judge
burnham
much
less
than
others
looking
on
had
done
and
so
gradual
and
subtle
had
been
the
change
in
her
own
feeling
from
almost
dislike
to
simple
indifference
and
from
thence
to
quickened
pulse
and
added
interest
in
life
at
his
approach
that
she
had
not
in
the
remotest
sense
realized
the
place
which
he
held
in
her
heart
until
his
own
words
revealed
it
to
her
that
she
liked
him
better
than
any
other
person
she
began
to
know
but
when
she
thought
about
it
at
all
it
seemed
a
most
natural
thing
that
she
should
it
was
not
saying
a
great
deal
she
told
herself
for
she
really
liked
very
few
persons
and
there
had
never
been
one
so
exceptionally
kind
and
unselfish
and
patient
what
should
she
do
but
like
him
sure
enough
and
yet
when
he
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
it
was
as
complete
a
surprise
as
human
experiences
could
ever
have
for
her
desolate
afflicted
deserted
as
she
felt
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
revelation
of
another
s
absorbed
interest
in
her
filled
her
heart
as
i
say
then
she
lived
it
alone
for
one
delightful
week
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
she
expected
judge
burnham
s
return
and
she
knew
that
his
first
step
would
be
an
interview
with
her
father
she
determined
to
be
herself
the
bearer
of
the
news
to
susan
during
this
last
week
whenever
she
thought
of
her
sister
it
had
been
a
tender
feeling
of
gratitude
for
all
the
quiet
unobtrusive
help
and
kindness
that
she
had
shown
since
she
first
came
into
the
family
ruth
determined
to
show
that
she
reposed
confidence
in
her
and
for
this
purpose
sought
her
room
ostensibly
on
some
trivial
errand
then
lingered
and
looked
at
a
book
that
lay
open
face
downward
as
if
to
keep
the
place
on
susan
s
little
table
susan
herself
was
arranging
her
hair
over
at
the
dressing
bureau
ruth
never
forgot
any
of
the
details
of
this
afternoon
scene
she
took
up
the
little
book
and
read
the
title
the
rest
of
it
had
a
pleasant
sound
of
any
sort
sounded
pleasantly
to
ruth
she
saw
that
it
was
a
religious
book
and
she
dimly
resolved
that
some
other
time
when
she
felt
quieter
had
less
important
plans
to
carry
out
she
would
read
this
book
look
more
closely
into
this
matter
and
find
if
she
could
what
it
was
that
made
the
difference
between
susan
s
experience
and
her
own
that
there
was
a
difference
was
evident
and
yet
without
realizing
it
ruth
s
happiness
of
the
last
few
days
was
making
her
satisfied
with
her
present
attainments
spiritually
no
not
exactly
satisfied
but
willing
to
put
the
matter
aside
for
a
more
convenient
season
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
i
think
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
she
said
at
last
still
turning
the
leaves
of
the
little
book
and
feeling
more
embarrassed
than
she
had
supposed
it
possible
for
to
feel
have
you
said
susan
brightly
good
i
like
to
hear
new
things
especially
when
they
have
to
do
with
my
and
there
was
that
in
her
tone
which
made
her
sister
understand
that
she
desired
to
convey
the
thought
that
she
felt
close
to
ruth
and
wanted
to
be
held
in
dear
relations
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ruth
was
conscious
of
being
willing
judge
burnham
is
to
return
yes
i
heard
you
speaking
of
there
was
wonderment
in
susan
s
tone
almost
as
well
as
words
could
have
done
it
said
what
is
there
specially
interesting
in
that
do
you
feel
ready
to
receive
him
in
a
new
relation
ruth
asked
and
she
was
vexed
to
feel
the
blood
surging
into
her
cheeks
i
think
he
has
a
desire
to
be
very
oh
ruth
there
was
no
mistaking
susan
s
tone
this
time
she
had
turned
from
the
mirror
and
was
surveying
her
sister
with
unmistakably
mournful
eyes
and
there
was
astonished
sorrow
in
her
tones
what
could
be
the
trouble
whatever
it
was
ruth
resented
it
well
she
said
haughtily
i
seem
to
have
disturbed
as
well
as
surprised
you
i
was
not
aware
that
the
news
would
be
i
beg
your
pardon
ruth
i
very
much
surprised
i
had
not
supposed
such
a
thing
why
pray
why
ruth
dear
he
is
not
a
christian
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
to
you
the
consternation
in
susan
s
face
and
voice
and
the
astonishment
in
ruth
s
well
she
said
again
it
is
surely
not
the
first
time
you
were
conscious
of
that
fact
he
will
be
in
no
more
danger
in
that
respect
with
me
for
a
wife
at
least
i
trust
he
will
susan
had
no
answer
to
make
to
this
strange
sentence
she
stood
brush
in
hand
gazing
bewilderingly
at
ruth
s
face
for
a
moment
then
recollecting
herself
turned
toward
the
mirror
again
with
the
simple
repeatal
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
as
for
ruth
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
her
to
analyze
her
feelings
they
hurt
was
she
angry
if
so
at
what
or
whom
her
heart
felt
in
a
tumult
now
i
want
you
to
understand
that
strange
as
it
may
appear
this
was
a
new
question
to
her
that
judge
burnham
was
not
a
christian
man
she
knew
and
regretted
but
that
it
should
affect
her
answer
to
his
question
was
a
thought
which
had
not
once
presented
itself
she
turned
and
went
out
from
that
room
without
another
word
and
feeling
that
she
never
wanted
to
say
any
more
words
to
that
girl
it
is
no
use
she
said
aloud
and
angrily
we
can
never
be
anything
to
each
other
and
it
is
folly
to
try
we
are
set
in
different
molds
i
no
sooner
try
to
make
a
friend
and
confidant
of
her
than
some
of
her
tiresome
notions
crop
out
and
destroy
it
she
knew
that
all
this
was
nonsense
she
knew
it
was
the
working
of
conscience
on
her
own
heart
that
was
at
this
moment
making
her
angry
and
yet
she
found
the
same
relief
which
possibly
you
and
i
have
felt
in
blaming
somebody
for
something
aloud
even
while
our
hearts
gainsayed
our
words
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
linger
over
this
part
of
ruth
erskine
s
history
the
time
has
come
to
go
on
to
other
scenes
but
in
this
chapter
i
want
to
bridge
the
way
by
a
word
or
two
of
explanation
so
that
you
may
the
better
understand
ruth
s
mood
and
the
governing
principle
of
her
actions
in
the
days
that
followed
by
degrees
she
came
to
a
quieter
state
of
however
until
the
formalities
of
the
new
relation
were
arranged
and
judge
burnham
had
become
practically
almost
one
of
the
family
she
grew
to
realizing
that
it
was
a
strange
perhaps
an
unaccountable
thing
that
she
a
christian
should
have
chosen
for
her
friend
and
hourly
companion
one
who
was
really
hardly
a
believer
in
the
christ
to
whom
she
had
given
herself
she
grew
to
feeling
that
if
this
thought
had
come
first
before
that
promise
was
made
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
made
a
different
answer
but
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
she
drew
in
with
this
thought
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
she
told
herself
it
was
settled
there
was
no
escape
from
promises
as
solemn
as
those
which
had
passed
between
them
that
such
covenants
were
doubtless
in
god
s
sight
as
sacred
as
the
marriage
relation
itself
and
she
was
glad
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
that
she
believed
this
reasoning
to
be
correct
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
curious
sensation
of
aversion
toward
the
one
who
had
as
it
seemed
to
her
rudely
disturbed
the
first
flush
of
her
happiness
the
glamour
was
gone
from
it
all
henceforth
a
dull
pain
a
sense
of
want
a
questioning
as
to
whether
she
was
just
where
she
should
be
came
in
with
all
the
enjoyment
and
she
struggled
with
the
temptation
to
feel
vindictive
toward
this
disturber
of
her
peace
besides
this
she
confided
to
judge
burnham
the
fact
that
susan
thought
she
was
doing
wrong
in
engaging
herself
to
a
man
who
was
not
a
christian
and
while
he
affected
to
laugh
over
it
as
a
bit
of
fanaticism
which
would
harm
no
one
and
which
was
the
result
of
her
life
hitherto
it
meant
more
than
that
to
upon
ruth
could
see
that
it
did
it
affected
perhaps
insensibly
his
manner
toward
the
offending
party
he
was
not
as
brotherly
as
he
had
designed
being
and
altogether
susan
since
the
change
was
to
come
did
not
regret
that
judge
burnham
s
disposition
was
to
hurry
it
with
all
possible
speed
life
was
less
pleasant
to
her
now
than
it
had
been
any
time
since
her
entrance
into
this
distinguished
family
the
pleasant
little
blossom
of
tenderness
which
had
seemed
to
be
about
to
make
itself
fragrant
for
her
sister
and
herself
had
received
a
rude
blast
and
was
likely
to
die
outright
during
the
weeks
that
followed
there
were
other
developments
which
served
to
startle
ruth
as
hardly
anything
had
done
hitherto
they
can
best
be
explained
by
giving
you
the
substance
of
a
conversation
between
judge
burnham
and
herself
i
ought
to
tell
you
something
he
said
and
the
brief
sentence
was
preceded
and
followed
by
a
pause
of
such
length
and
by
such
evident
embarrassment
that
ruth
s
laugh
had
a
tinge
of
wonder
in
it
as
she
said
then
by
all
means
i
hope
you
will
do
i
suppose
it
is
not
altogether
new
to
you
he
said
inquiringly
your
father
has
doubtless
told
you
somewhat
of
my
past
she
shook
her
head
absolutely
nothing
save
that
you
were
like
himself
a
lawyer
resident
in
the
city
during
and
having
a
somewhere
he
didn
t
seem
to
be
very
clear
as
to
that
where
is
it
i
think
i
shall
be
glad
to
live
in
the
country
i
never
tried
it
but
i
have
an
idea
that
it
must
be
delightful
to
get
away
from
the
tumult
of
the
city
do
you
enjoy
it
judge
burnham
s
unaccountable
embarrassment
increased
you
wouldn
t
like
he
said
decidedly
i
never
mean
you
to
see
it
if
it
can
be
helped
there
is
a
long
story
connected
with
it
and
with
that
part
of
my
life
i
am
sorry
that
it
is
entirely
new
to
you
the
affair
will
be
more
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
may
i
ask
you
if
you
mean
you
are
ignorant
of
my
early
life
is
it
unknown
to
you
that
i
have
once
been
a
married
man
there
was
no
mistaking
the
start
and
the
flush
of
surprise
if
it
was
no
deeper
feeling
that
ruth
exhibited
but
she
answered
quietly
enough
i
am
entirely
ignorant
of
your
past
history
viewed
in
any
judge
burnham
drew
a
heavy
sigh
i
said
the
story
was
a
long
one
but
i
can
make
it
very
he
began
you
know
that
a
of
joy
or
misery
can
be
expressed
in
one
sentence
well
i
married
when
i
was
a
boy
married
in
haste
and
repented
at
leisure
as
many
a
boy
has
my
wife
died
when
we
had
been
living
together
for
five
years
and
i
have
two
daughters
they
are
almost
women
i
suppose
now
the
oldest
is
seventeen
and
they
live
at
the
place
which
you
call
my
now
these
are
the
headlines
of
the
story
perhaps
you
could
imagine
the
rest
better
than
i
can
tell
you
the
filling
out
would
take
hours
and
would
be
disagreeable
both
to
you
and
to
me
i
trust
you
will
let
me
relieve
you
from
the
trial
of
hearing
there
is
one
thing
i
specially
desire
to
say
to
you
before
this
conversation
proceeds
further
that
is
i
supposed
of
course
you
were
familiar
with
these
outlines
at
least
so
far
as
my
marriage
is
concerned
else
i
should
have
told
you
long
ago
i
have
not
meant
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
of
you
i
had
not
an
idea
that
i
was
doing
does
my
father
know
that
you
have
daughters
this
was
ruth
s
question
and
her
voice
low
and
constrained
sounded
so
strangely
to
herself
that
she
remembered
noticing
it
even
then
i
do
not
know
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
does
not
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
any
acquaintance
of
mine
in
the
city
knows
this
part
of
my
history
my
married
life
was
isolated
from
them
all
i
have
not
attempted
to
conceal
it
and
at
the
same
time
i
have
made
no
effort
to
tell
it
i
am
painfully
conscious
of
how
all
this
must
look
to
you
yet
i
know
you
will
believe
that
i
intended
no
deception
with
regard
to
my
daughters
my
professional
life
has
kept
me
from
them
almost
constantly
so
that
no
idea
of
and
associated
with
them
i
have
no
intention
of
burying
you
in
the
country
and
indeed
my
errand
here
at
this
hour
was
to
talk
with
you
in
regard
to
the
merits
of
two
hotels
at
either
of
which
we
can
secure
desirable
he
hurried
over
this
part
of
his
sentence
in
a
nervous
way
as
one
who
was
trying
by
a
rapid
change
of
subject
to
turn
the
current
of
thought
ruth
brought
him
back
to
it
with
a
question
which
stabbed
him
but
judge
burnham
what
sort
of
a
father
can
you
have
been
all
these
years
he
flushed
and
paled
under
it
and
under
the
steadiness
of
her
gaze
have
hardly
deserved
the
name
of
father
i
suppose
and
yet
in
some
respects
i
have
tried
to
do
what
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
ruth
you
don
t
understand
the
situation
you
think
you
do
and
it
looks
badly
to
you
but
there
are
circumstances
which
make
it
a
peculiarly
trying
one
however
they
are
not
circumstances
which
need
to
touch
i
meant
and
i
mean
to
shield
you
from
all
these
trials
i
asked
you
to
be
not
my
housekeeper
not
a
of
two
girls
who
would
be
utterly
uncongenial
to
you
but
my
she
interrupted
him
and
do
you
suppose
judge
burnham
that
you
and
i
can
settle
down
to
a
life
together
of
selfish
enjoyment
in
each
others
society
ignoring
the
claims
which
your
children
have
on
you
and
which
assuredly
if
i
become
your
wife
they
on
me
could
you
respect
me
if
i
were
willing
to
do
so
it
was
clear
that
judge
burnham
was
utterly
confounded
he
arose
and
stood
confronting
her
for
she
had
risen
to
draw
aside
a
and
had
not
in
speaking
resumed
her
seat
you
do
not
understand
he
muttered
at
last
i
have
meant
nothing
wrong
i
provide
for
them
and
am
willing
to
do
so
i
see
that
they
are
taken
care
of
i
do
not
propose
to
desert
them
but
it
would
be
simply
preposterous
to
think
of
burying
you
up
there
in
the
country
with
that
sort
of
companionship
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
have
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
such
a
then
it
is
clearly
time
to
think
if
i
do
not
understand
judge
burnham
neither
do
you
understand
me
my
life
has
been
anything
but
a
perfect
one
or
a
happy
one
i
have
gone
so
far
wrong
myself
that
it
ill
becomes
me
to
find
fault
with
others
but
there
is
one
thing
i
will
never
do
i
will
never
come
between
a
father
and
his
children
separating
them
from
the
place
which
they
ought
to
have
beside
him
chapter
xvii
duty
s
burden
by
degrees
judge
burnham
began
to
understand
the
woman
whom
he
had
chosen
for
his
wife
hitherto
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
being
governed
by
his
own
will
of
bending
forces
to
his
strong
purposes
those
occasional
characters
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
who
refused
to
be
molded
by
him
he
had
let
alone
crossing
their
path
as
little
as
possible
and
teaching
himself
to
believe
that
they
were
not
worth
managing
which
was
the
sole
reason
why
he
did
not
manage
them
but
ruth
erskine
was
a
new
what
she
believed
to
be
the
right
thing
and
she
yield
her
convictions
to
be
governed
by
his
judgment
he
could
not
manage
and
he
had
no
wish
to
desert
her
clearly
one
of
them
must
yield
the
entire
affair
served
to
keep
him
in
a
perturbed
state
of
mind
ruth
grew
more
settled
weeks
went
by
and
her
decisions
were
made
her
plans
formed
and
she
walked
steadily
toward
their
accomplishment
not
realizing
it
herself
she
was
yet
engaged
in
making
a
compromise
with
her
conscience
she
believed
herself
perhaps
to
have
done
wrong
in
promising
to
become
the
wife
of
a
man
who
ignored
the
principle
which
governed
her
life
she
would
not
give
back
that
promise
but
she
would
make
the
life
one
of
instead
for
one
brief
week
it
had
seemed
to
resting
place
full
of
light
she
would
be
his
wife
but
she
would
also
be
the
mother
of
his
daughters
she
would
live
with
them
for
them
give
up
her
plans
her
tastes
her
pursuits
for
their
sake
in
short
she
would
assume
the
martyr
s
garb
in
good
earnest
now
and
wear
it
for
a
lifetime
the
more
repulsive
this
course
seemed
to
it
grew
very
repulsive
more
steadily
she
clung
to
it
and
it
was
not
obstinacy
you
are
to
understand
it
will
do
for
such
as
judge
burnham
to
call
such
resolves
by
that
name
but
you
should
know
that
ruth
erskine
was
all
the
time
governed
by
a
solemn
sense
of
duty
it
was
hard
cold
unlightened
by
any
gleams
of
peace
but
for
all
that
it
started
in
a
sense
of
by
degrees
the
long
story
much
of
it
came
to
was
dragged
to
a
persistent
method
of
which
drove
judge
burnham
to
the
very
verge
of
desperation
judge
burnham
she
would
begin
how
have
your
daughters
been
cared
for
all
these
years
why
he
said
wriggling
and
trying
to
get
away
from
his
own
sense
of
degradation
they
had
good
care
at
least
i
supposed
it
was
during
their
childhood
their
mother
s
sister
lived
there
and
took
the
sole
charge
of
them
she
was
a
woman
enough
and
did
her
duty
by
but
she
died
you
told
me
when
they
were
still
yes
that
was
when
i
was
abroad
you
see
when
i
went
i
expected
to
return
in
a
year
at
most
but
i
staid
on
following
one
perplexing
tangle
after
another
in
connection
with
my
business
affairs
until
four
or
five
years
slipped
away
meantime
their
aunt
died
and
the
old
housekeeper
who
had
lived
with
their
family
since
the
last
century
sometime
took
her
place
and
managed
for
them
as
well
as
she
could
i
didn
t
realize
how
things
were
going
i
imagined
everything
would
come
out
right
you
i
don
t
see
how
they
could
ruth
said
coldly
and
judge
burnham
answered
nothing
didn
t
they
attend
school
why
yes
they
went
to
the
country
school
out
there
you
know
when
there
was
one
it
is
too
near
the
city
to
secure
good
advantages
and
yet
too
far
away
for
convenience
i
meant
you
see
to
have
them
in
town
when
i
came
home
at
the
best
schools
and
boarding
with
me
but
i
found
it
utterly
so
you
have
no
conception
of
what
five
years
of
absence
will
do
for
i
can
imagine
something
of
what
five
years
of
neglect
would
ruth
said
it
she
speak
then
he
would
say
oh
ruth
in
a
tone
which
was
entreating
and
almost
pitiful
and
he
would
start
up
and
pace
back
and
forth
through
the
room
for
a
moment
until
brought
back
by
one
of
her
stabbing
questions
how
have
they
lived
since
your
return
why
right
there
just
where
they
always
have
lived
it
is
the
only
home
they
have
ever
and
they
are
entirely
alone
why
no
the
housekeeper
of
whom
i
told
you
had
a
daughter
a
trustworthy
woman
and
when
her
mother
died
this
daughter
moved
to
the
house
with
her
family
and
has
taken
care
of
and
so
judge
burnham
your
two
daughters
have
grown
to
young
ladyhood
isolated
from
companionship
and
from
education
and
from
refinements
of
every
sort
even
from
their
own
father
and
have
been
the
companions
of
ignorant
hirelings
i
tell
you
ruth
you
must
see
them
before
you
can
understand
this
thing
he
would
exclaim
in
almost
despair
i
assuredly
mean
to
would
be
her
quiet
answer
which
answer
drove
him
nearer
to
desperation
than
he
was
before
at
last
he
came
and
stood
before
her
you
force
me
to
speak
plainly
he
said
i
would
have
shielded
you
forever
and
you
will
not
let
me
these
girls
are
not
like
your
class
of
girls
they
have
no
interest
in
refined
pursuits
they
have
no
refinement
of
feeling
or
manner
they
have
no
desire
for
education
they
do
not
even
care
to
keep
their
persons
in
ordinarily
tasteful
attire
they
care
nothing
for
the
refinements
of
home
they
belong
to
a
lower
order
of
being
it
is
simply
impossible
to
conceive
of
them
as
my
children
and
it
is
utterly
preposterous
to
think
of
your
associating
with
them
in
any
she
was
stilled
at
it
would
she
sat
in
utter
silence
for
minutes
that
seemed
to
him
hours
while
he
stood
before
her
and
waited
when
at
last
she
spoke
her
voice
was
not
so
cold
as
it
had
been
but
it
was
controlled
and
intensely
grave
and
yet
judge
burnham
they
your
children
and
you
are
bound
to
them
by
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
vows
which
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
take
on
his
lips
how
can
you
ever
hope
to
escape
a
just
reward
for
ignoring
them
now
i
must
tell
you
what
i
feel
and
mean
i
do
not
intend
to
be
hard
or
harsh
and
yet
i
intend
to
be
true
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
acting
or
talking
as
other
girls
would
under
like
circumstances
but
that
is
a
question
which
has
never
troubled
me
i
am
acting
in
what
i
believe
to
be
the
right
way
you
have
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
and
i
have
promised
in
good
faith
it
was
before
i
knew
any
of
this
story
which
in
a
sense
alters
the
ground
on
which
we
stood
i
will
tell
you
plainly
what
i
believe
i
ought
to
do
and
what
with
my
present
views
i
do
i
will
give
my
life
to
helping
you
in
this
matter
i
will
go
up
to
that
home
of
yours
and
hide
myself
with
those
girls
and
we
will
both
do
what
we
can
to
retrieve
the
mistakes
of
a
lifetime
i
will
struggle
and
plan
and
endure
for
them
i
am
somewhat
versed
in
the
duties
which
this
sort
of
living
involves
as
you
know
and
in
the
crosses
which
it
brings
perhaps
it
was
for
this
reason
they
were
sent
to
me
i
have
chafed
under
them
and
been
weak
and
worthless
god
knows
and
yet
i
feel
that
perhaps
he
is
giving
me
another
chance
i
will
try
to
do
better
work
for
him
in
your
home
than
i
have
in
my
own
at
any
rate
i
if
i
fail
it
shall
be
after
the
most
solemn
and
earnest
efforts
that
i
can
make
but
as
i
said
it
tried
this
is
not
all
judge
burnham
i
mean
that
i
could
not
do
it
would
not
see
that
i
had
any
right
to
do
it
if
i
had
not
given
my
heart
to
and
if
for
the
love
of
you
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
help
you
in
duty
but
you
must
fully
understand
that
it
seems
unquestionably
to
be
your
duty
you
must
not
shirk
it
i
must
never
help
you
to
shirk
it
i
should
not
dare
i
will
go
with
you
to
that
home
and
be
with
you
a
member
of
that
family
but
i
can
never
make
with
you
another
home
that
does
not
include
the
i
never
do
judge
burnham
hoped
to
turn
her
away
from
this
decision
which
was
to
him
simply
an
awful
one
do
you
imagine
that
he
accomplished
it
i
believe
you
know
her
better
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
remember
that
he
did
not
understand
the
underlying
motive
by
which
she
was
governed
when
she
said
i
not
do
it
he
did
not
understand
that
she
meant
her
vows
to
christ
would
not
let
her
he
believed
simply
that
she
set
her
judgment
above
his
in
this
matter
and
determined
that
she
not
yield
it
the
struggle
was
a
severe
one
at
times
he
felt
as
though
he
would
say
to
her
if
she
not
share
with
him
the
home
he
had
so
lovingly
and
tenderly
planned
for
her
why
then
must
give
her
up
the
only
reason
that
he
did
not
say
this
was
because
he
did
not
dare
to
try
it
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
giving
her
up
and
he
was
afraid
she
would
take
him
at
his
word
as
assuredly
she
would
have
done
she
was
dearer
to
him
in
her
obstinacy
than
anything
in
nothing
must
be
risked
therefore
was
he
sore
beset
and
as
often
as
he
renewed
the
struggle
he
came
off
worsted
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
ruth
could
constantly
flee
back
to
that
unanswerable
judge
burnham
it
is
i
not
do
it
what
if
didn
t
understand
her
he
saw
that
she
understood
herself
and
meant
what
she
said
so
it
came
to
pass
that
as
the
days
went
by
and
the
hour
for
the
marriage
drew
nearer
and
nearer
judge
burnham
felt
the
plans
so
dear
to
his
heart
slipping
away
from
under
his
control
ruth
would
be
well
that
was
a
great
point
gained
but
she
would
not
go
away
for
a
wedding
journey
she
would
not
go
to
the
grand
hotel
where
he
desired
to
take
not
for
a
day
or
hour
she
would
not
have
the
trial
of
contrast
between
the
few
first
bright
days
of
each
other
and
the
dismal
days
following
when
they
had
each
other
with
something
constantly
coming
between
she
would
go
directly
to
that
country
home
and
nowhere
else
she
would
go
to
it
just
as
it
was
he
was
not
to
alter
the
surroundings
or
the
outward
life
in
one
single
respect
she
meant
to
see
the
home
influence
which
had
molded
those
girls
exactly
as
it
had
breathed
about
them
without
any
outside
hand
to
change
it
she
proposed
to
do
the
changing
herself
one
little
bit
of
compromise
her
stern
conscience
future
husband
might
fit
up
one
room
for
her
private
to
his
individual
taste
and
she
would
accept
it
from
him
as
hers
but
the
outer
life
that
was
to
be
lived
as
a
family
he
must
not
touch
but
ruth
he
said
you
do
not
understand
things
have
utterly
gone
to
decay
there
was
no
one
to
care
or
appreciate
there
was
no
one
to
care
of
anything
and
i
let
everything
very
well
she
said
then
we
will
see
what
our
united
tastes
can
do
toward
setting
everything
right
when
we
come
to
feel
what
is
then
couldn
t
you
go
with
me
and
see
the
place
a
few
weeks
before
we
go
there
and
give
directions
such
as
you
would
like
to
see
carried
out
a
few
you
know
such
as
you
can
take
in
at
a
glance
to
make
it
a
little
more
like
home
she
shook
her
head
decidedly
no
indeed
she
was
not
going
there
to
spy
out
the
desolation
of
the
land
she
was
going
to
it
as
a
and
if
as
a
home
it
was
defective
together
his
daughters
and
see
what
was
needed
and
remodel
it
how
dismally
he
shook
his
head
over
that
he
knew
his
daughters
and
she
did
not
he
tried
again
but
ruth
it
is
five
miles
from
the
railroad
how
will
it
be
possible
to
ride
ten
miles
by
train
and
five
by
carriage
night
and
morning
and
attend
to
business
easily
she
said
quietly
except
in
the
busiest
season
that
my
father
ever
had
we
were
in
the
country
and
he
came
out
nearly
every
evening
in
we
must
come
into
town
and
board
i
he
winced
over
this
and
was
silent
and
felt
himself
giving
up
his
last
hope
of
holding
this
thing
in
check
and
began
to
realize
that
he
loved
this
future
wife
of
his
very
much
indeed
else
he
could
never
submit
to
such
a
state
of
things
he
believed
it
would
last
for
but
a
little
long
enough
for
her
to
see
the
hopelessness
of
things
but
this
seeing
with
her
into
all
its
hopelessness
was
what
he
shrank
from
so
the
days
went
by
not
much
joy
in
them
for
any
one
concerned
away
from
ruth
s
influence
judge
burnham
was
annoyed
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
hardly
make
a
civil
answer
to
the
most
ordinary
question
and
his
office
clerks
grumbled
among
themselves
that
if
it
made
such
a
bear
of
a
man
to
know
that
in
three
weeks
he
was
to
have
a
wife
they
hoped
their
turn
would
never
come
away
from
his
presence
ruth
was
grave
to
a
degree
that
threw
an
added
shadow
over
the
susan
felt
herself
to
be
in
disgrace
with
her
sister
and
had
been
unable
thus
far
to
rise
above
it
and
be
helpful
as
she
would
have
liked
to
be
judge
erskine
hearing
more
details
from
his
friend
than
from
his
daughter
sympathized
with
her
strong
sense
of
duty
honored
her
rejoiced
in
her
strength
of
purpose
and
was
for
her
realizing
more
than
before
what
a
continuous
chain
of
trial
her
life
had
been
of
late
therefore
his
tone
was
tender
and
sympathizing
when
he
spoke
to
her
but
sad
as
one
who
felt
deeply
and
was
not
able
to
impart
strength
as
for
erskine
she
had
so
much
to
say
about
the
strangeness
of
it
how
judge
burnham
could
have
managed
to
keep
things
so
secret
and
how
the
girls
looked
whether
they
favored
him
or
their
ma
and
whether
they
would
be
comfortable
sort
of
persons
to
get
along
ruth
was
driven
to
the
very
verge
of
distraction
and
felt
at
times
that
to
get
out
of
that
house
into
any
other
on
earth
would
be
a
relief
there
was
much
ado
also
about
that
wedding
erskine
wanted
marvelous
illumination
and
a
feast
and
a
crowd
and
all
the
resources
of
the
as
to
bridal
toilet
but
here
as
in
other
matters
ruth
held
steadily
to
her
own
way
and
brought
it
to
strictly
private
wedding
in
the
front
parlor
of
her
father
s
house
not
a
person
outside
of
the
erskine
family
circle
to
witness
the
ceremony
save
marion
dennis
she
by
virtue
of
being
dennis
wife
gained
admission
but
marion
dennis
tears
fell
fast
behind
the
raised
handkerchief
which
shielded
her
face
during
the
solemn
prayer
she
knew
in
detail
some
of
ruth
s
plans
she
knew
better
than
ruth
plans
are
sometimes
hard
to
carry
out
how
many
had
indulged
and
at
this
moment
there
sat
at
home
her
haughty
daughter
grace
entirely
unforgiving
because
of
meddling
she
styled
the
earnest
attempts
to
shield
her
from
danger
to
marion
ruth
s
future
had
never
looked
less
hopeful
than
it
did
on
this
marriage
morning
it
may
be
that
her
own
disappointments
caused
some
of
the
flowing
tears
but
her
ached
for
ruth
what
should
do
without
a
christian
husband
entirely
in
sympathy
with
every
effort
and
entirely
tender
with
every
failure
of
hers
what
was
ruth
to
do
with
judge
burnham
for
a
husband
instead
of
dennis
how
were
the
trials
of
life
to
be
borne
with
any
man
living
except
this
thus
reasoned
silly
indeed
but
that
was
as
it
seemed
to
her
well
for
ruth
that
even
at
this
moment
she
could
look
into
the
face
of
the
man
whom
she
had
chosen
and
feel
it
is
after
all
for
there
is
no
other
person
for
whom
i
could
begin
this
said
a
friend
the
other
day
in
sympathetic
tones
as
she
spoke
of
a
young
bride
going
far
from
her
home
and
her
mother
i
feel
sorry
for
her
it
is
such
a
trying
experience
all
alone
away
from
all
her
early
but
i
said
after
all
she
doesn
t
go
as
far
as
you
told
me
you
did
when
you
were
the
answer
was
quick
oh
no
but
then
i
had
you
know
and
and
then
she
stopped
to
laugh
so
it
was
a
blessed
thing
that
ruth
burnham
going
out
from
the
home
which
had
sheltered
her
felt
that
she
went
her
chapter
xviii
embarrassment
and
merriment
i
suppose
there
was
never
a
bride
going
out
from
her
home
with
her
husband
who
was
more
silent
than
was
our
ruth
it
was
the
silence
of
constraint
too
it
was
such
a
little
journey
ten
miles
or
so
by
train
then
five
by
carriage
and
they
coming
to
if
only
it
had
been
her
husband
s
happy
home
where
treasures
were
waiting
to
greet
him
and
be
clasped
to
his
heart
ruth
felt
that
it
would
have
been
much
easier
yet
i
think
very
likely
she
did
not
understand
her
own
heart
probably
the
easiest
excuse
that
we
can
make
for
ourselves
or
for
our
shrinking
from
duties
is
if
it
were
something
else
i
could
do
i
think
it
quite
likely
that
had
ruth
been
going
to
just
such
a
home
as
she
imagined
would
make
her
cross
lighter
she
would
have
been
jealous
of
those
clasping
hands
and
tender
kisses
the
human
heart
is
a
strange
instrument
played
upon
in
all
sorts
of
discords
even
when
we
think
there
is
going
to
be
music
as
it
was
the
certainty
of
her
husband
s
disapproval
the
sense
of
strangeness
and
the
sense
of
shrinking
from
the
new
trials
and
the
questioning
as
to
whether
after
all
she
had
done
right
all
served
to
depress
ruth
s
heart
and
hush
her
voice
to
such
a
degree
that
she
felt
speech
was
impossible
i
want
to
linger
a
minute
over
one
questioning
as
to
whether
after
all
she
had
done
right
there
is
no
more
miserable
state
of
mind
than
this
it
is
such
dreadful
ground
for
the
to
occupy
yet
practically
half
the
christians
in
the
world
are
there
theoretically
we
believe
ourselves
to
be
led
even
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
by
the
spirit
of
god
theoretically
we
believe
that
can
make
no
mistake
theoretically
we
believe
that
it
is
just
as
easy
to
get
an
answer
from
that
a
word
behind
thee
as
the
bible
phrases
it
directing
us
which
way
to
it
is
to
hear
our
human
friend
answer
to
our
call
but
practically
what
we
believe
what
is
the
reason
that
so
much
of
our
life
is
given
up
to
mourning
over
mistakes
is
it
because
we
choose
to
decide
some
questions
for
ourselves
without
bringing
them
to
the
test
of
prayer
or
because
having
asked
for
direction
we
failed
to
watch
for
the
answer
or
expect
it
and
so
lost
the
still
small
voice
or
is
it
sometimes
because
having
heard
the
voice
we
regret
its
direction
and
turn
from
it
and
choose
our
own
ruth
burnham
was
conscious
of
none
of
these
states
she
had
prayed
over
this
matter
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
done
little
else
than
pray
of
late
and
in
some
points
she
was
strong
feeling
that
her
feet
had
been
set
upon
a
rock
but
in
others
there
was
at
this
too
late
moment
a
sense
of
faltering
might
she
not
asked
her
conscience
of
her
have
yielded
somewhat
would
it
have
worked
any
ill
for
them
both
to
have
gone
away
from
everybody
for
a
few
weeks
as
judge
burnham
so
desired
to
do
and
have
learned
to
know
and
help
each
other
and
have
learned
to
talk
freely
together
about
this
new
home
and
have
grown
stronger
together
before
facing
this
manifest
duty
i
do
not
tell
you
she
might
have
done
all
this
perhaps
her
first
position
that
it
would
have
been
unwise
and
unhelpful
was
the
right
one
i
think
we
do
sometimes
put
added
touches
of
our
own
to
the
cross
that
the
father
lays
upon
us
making
it
shade
in
gloom
when
he
would
have
tinted
it
with
the
sunlight
but
i
do
not
say
that
ruth
had
done
this
i
don
t
know
which
was
wise
what
i
sure
of
is
that
she
having
left
it
to
christ
having
asked
for
his
direction
and
having
received
it
for
unless
she
thought
she
had
been
shown
the
step
to
take
assured
she
ought
not
to
have
stepped
she
had
no
right
to
unrest
herself
and
strap
on
to
her
heart
the
burden
of
that
wearying
question
i
after
all
do
right
judge
burnham
could
match
her
in
quietness
he
had
her
beside
him
at
last
she
was
his
wife
she
bore
his
name
henceforth
their
interests
were
one
thus
much
of
what
he
had
months
ago
set
himself
steadily
to
accomplish
had
been
accomplished
but
not
a
touch
of
the
details
was
according
to
his
plans
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
was
so
new
and
so
bewildering
that
while
he
meant
for
her
sake
to
make
the
best
of
it
until
such
time
as
she
should
see
that
she
was
wrong
and
he
right
yet
truth
to
tell
he
hardly
knew
how
to
set
about
making
the
best
of
it
he
did
what
he
could
no
topic
for
conversation
that
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
seemed
entirely
safe
and
beside
what
use
to
try
to
converse
for
so
short
a
journey
so
he
contented
himself
with
opening
her
and
dropping
her
blind
and
arranging
her
comfortably
for
a
and
in
other
nameless
thoughtful
ways
making
this
bit
of
a
journey
bright
with
tenderness
it
served
to
show
ruth
how
royally
he
would
have
cared
for
her
in
the
longer
journey
which
he
wanted
and
which
she
wouldn
t
have
whereupon
she
immediately
said
to
her
heart
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
and
that
made
her
miserable
there
was
no
time
to
yield
now
the
station
was
called
out
and
there
was
bustle
and
haste
and
no
little
nervousness
in
getting
off
in
time
for
the
train
seemed
before
it
fairly
halted
to
have
been
sorry
for
that
attempt
at
accommodation
and
began
to
show
signs
of
going
on
again
that
were
it
annoyed
judge
burnham
to
the
degree
that
he
said
savagely
to
the
conductor
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
stop
if
you
can
t
do
it
more
he
would
have
liked
so
much
to
have
been
leisurely
and
comfortable
to
have
done
everything
in
a
composed
travelled
manner
he
understood
so
thoroughly
all
the
details
of
travelled
life
why
he
not
show
ruth
some
of
the
comforts
of
it
that
little
station
it
was
in
itself
a
curiosity
to
ruth
she
had
not
supposed
that
ten
miles
away
from
a
city
anything
could
be
so
diminutive
a
long
low
unpainted
building
with
benches
for
seats
and
loungers
spitting
for
furniture
there
was
evidently
something
unusual
to
stare
at
this
was
the
presence
of
a
quiet
tasteful
carriage
with
handsome
horses
and
a
driver
who
indicated
by
the
very
flourish
of
his
whip
that
this
was
a
new
locality
to
him
he
and
his
horses
and
his
carriage
belonged
unmistakably
to
and
had
rarely
reached
so
far
out
is
this
your
carriage
ruth
asked
surveying
it
with
a
touch
of
satisfaction
as
judge
burnham
made
her
comfortable
among
the
cushions
no
it
is
from
town
there
are
no
carriages
belonging
to
this
enlightened
how
do
your
family
reach
the
station
then
they
never
reach
it
he
answered
composedly
he
had
resolved
upon
not
trying
to
smooth
over
anything
but
how
did
you
get
to
and
from
the
cars
when
you
were
stopping
here
on
the
rare
occasions
when
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
stop
here
i
sometimes
caught
the
wagon
which
brings
the
mail
and
takes
unfortunate
passengers
or
if
i
were
too
early
for
that
there
were
certain
and
which
gave
me
the
privilege
of
a
ride
with
a
little
persuasion
in
the
shape
of
nothing
could
be
more
studiedly
polite
than
judge
burnham
s
tone
but
there
was
a
covert
sarcasm
in
every
word
he
said
he
seemed
to
ruth
to
be
thinking
i
hope
you
realize
the
uncomfortable
position
into
which
your
obstinacy
has
forced
evidently
not
a
touch
of
help
was
to
be
had
from
him
what
were
they
to
talk
about
during
that
five
miles
of
travel
over
a
rough
road
ruth
studied
her
brains
to
try
to
develop
a
subject
that
would
not
make
them
even
more
uncomfortable
than
they
now
felt
she
was
unfortunate
in
selection
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
away
from
the
thoughts
which
were
just
now
so
prominently
before
them
she
suddenly
remembered
a
fact
which
surprised
her
and
to
which
she
gave
instant
expression
judge
burnham
what
are
your
daughter
s
names
the
gentleman
thus
addressed
wrinkled
his
forehead
into
a
dozen
frowns
and
shook
himself
as
though
he
would
like
to
shake
away
all
remembrance
of
the
subject
before
he
said
their
very
names
are
a
source
of
mortification
to
me
the
elder
is
seraphina
and
the
other
araminta
what
do
you
think
of
them
ruth
was
silent
and
dismayed
this
apparently
trivial
circumstance
served
to
show
her
what
a
strange
state
of
things
existed
in
the
home
whither
she
was
going
she
didn
t
know
how
to
answer
her
husband
s
question
she
was
sorry
that
she
had
asked
any
there
seemed
no
way
out
but
to
ask
another
which
in
truth
pressed
upon
her
how
do
you
soften
such
names
what
do
you
call
them
when
you
address
them
i
call
them
nothing
i
know
of
no
way
of
smoothing
such
hopeless
cognomens
and
i
take
refuge
in
silence
or
bewildering
ruth
pondered
over
this
answer
long
enough
to
have
her
courage
rise
and
to
grow
almost
indignant
then
she
spoke
again
but
judge
burnham
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
have
allowed
so
strange
a
selection
for
girls
in
this
age
of
the
world
why
didn
t
you
save
them
from
such
a
infliction
or
was
there
some
reason
for
the
use
of
these
names
that
dignifies
makes
them
sacred
there
is
this
sole
reason
for
the
names
and
for
many
things
which
you
will
find
yourself
unable
to
understand
their
mother
was
a
hopeless
victim
to
sensation
novels
and
named
her
daughters
from
that
standpoint
i
was
in
reality
powerless
to
interfere
you
may
have
discovered
before
this
that
i
am
not
always
able
to
follow
out
the
dictates
of
my
own
judgment
and
others
as
well
as
myself
have
to
suffer
in
what
could
ruth
answer
to
this
she
felt
its
covert
meaning
and
so
sure
was
she
beginning
to
feel
that
she
had
followed
her
own
ideas
instead
of
the
leadings
of
any
higher
voice
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
be
offended
with
the
plainness
of
the
insinuation
but
she
realized
that
it
was
a
strange
conversation
for
a
husband
and
wife
she
took
refuge
again
in
silence
judge
burnham
tried
to
talk
he
asked
if
the
seat
she
occupied
was
entirely
comfortable
and
if
she
enjoyed
riding
and
if
she
had
tried
the
saddle
or
thought
she
would
enjoy
such
exercise
and
presently
he
said
these
are
abominable
roads
i
am
sorry
to
have
you
so
roughly
treated
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
journey
together
i
did
not
want
roughness
to
come
to
you
ruth
i
thought
that
you
had
endured
she
was
sorry
that
he
said
this
her
tears
were
never
nearer
the
surface
than
at
this
moment
and
she
did
not
want
to
shed
them
she
began
to
talk
rapidly
to
him
about
the
beauty
of
the
hills
which
stretched
bluely
before
them
and
he
tried
to
help
her
effort
and
appreciate
them
still
it
was
too
apparent
just
then
neither
cared
much
for
hills
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
the
carriage
at
last
drew
up
under
a
row
of
elms
these
at
least
were
beautiful
so
was
the
long
irregular
grassy
yard
that
stretched
away
up
the
hill
and
was
shaded
by
noble
old
trees
it
required
but
a
moment
to
dismiss
the
carriage
and
then
her
husband
gave
her
his
arm
and
together
they
toiled
up
the
straggling
walk
toward
the
long
low
building
which
was
in
dire
need
of
paint
this
yard
is
lovely
ruth
said
and
she
wondered
if
her
voice
trembled
very
much
i
used
to
like
the
yard
a
hundred
years
or
so
ago
he
answered
sadly
it
really
seems
to
me
almost
as
long
ago
as
that
since
i
had
any
pleasant
recollections
of
anything
connected
with
was
it
your
mother
s
home
yes
he
said
and
his
face
grew
tender
and
she
was
a
good
mother
ruth
i
loved
the
old
house
once
for
her
i
think
i
can
make
you
love
it
again
for
ruth
said
the
words
gently
with
a
tender
intonation
that
was
very
pleasant
to
hear
and
that
not
many
people
heard
from
her
judge
burnham
was
aware
of
it
and
his
grave
face
brightened
a
little
he
reached
after
her
hand
and
held
it
within
his
own
and
the
pressure
he
gave
it
said
what
he
could
not
speak
so
they
went
up
the
steps
of
that
low
porch
with
lighter
hearts
after
all
than
had
seemed
possible
the
door
at
the
end
of
that
porch
opened
directly
into
the
front
room
or
keeping
room
as
in
the
parlance
of
that
region
of
country
it
was
called
though
ruth
did
not
know
it
the
opening
of
that
door
was
a
revelation
to
her
she
had
never
been
in
a
real
country
room
before
there
were
green
paper
shades
to
the
windows
worn
with
years
and
faded
and
little
twinkling
rays
of
the
summer
sunshine
pushed
in
through
innumerable
tiny
holes
which
holes
curiously
enough
ruth
saw
and
remembered
and
associated
forever
after
with
that
hour
and
moment
there
was
a
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
of
dingy
colors
and
uneven
weaving
ruth
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
that
style
of
carpet
but
she
knew
it
was
peculiar
there
were
chairs
standing
in
solemn
rows
at
proper
intervals
there
was
a
square
table
or
stand
if
she
had
but
known
the
proper
name
for
it
covered
with
a
red
cotton
cloth
having
a
gay
border
and
fringed
edges
there
was
a
wooden
chair
or
two
shrinking
back
from
contact
with
the
smarter
ones
and
there
was
a
large
wooden
rocker
covered
back
and
arms
and
sides
with
a
gay
cover
aglow
with
red
and
green
and
yellow
and
it
seemed
to
poor
ruth
a
hundred
other
dazzling
colors
and
the
whole
effect
reminded
her
forcibly
of
judge
erskine
now
you
have
a
list
of
every
article
of
furniture
which
this
large
room
contained
no
i
forget
the
though
ruth
did
not
it
was
long
and
deep
and
high
and
was
adorned
with
a
curious
picture
or
two
which
would
bear
studying
before
you
could
be
sure
what
they
were
and
with
two
large
bright
brass
candlesticks
and
a
tray
and
snuffers
also
in
the
center
a
kerosene
lamp
which
looked
depraved
enough
to
smoke
like
a
furnace
without
even
waiting
to
be
lighted
also
there
were
some
oriental
paintings
in
wooden
frames
on
the
wall
are
you
so
fortunate
as
not
to
understand
what
oriental
paintings
are
then
you
will
be
unable
to
comprehend
a
description
of
ruth
s
face
as
her
eye
rested
on
them
judge
burnham
was
looking
at
her
as
her
eye
roved
swiftly
and
silently
over
this
scene
not
excepting
the
curious
paper
with
which
the
walls
were
hung
in
a
pattern
long
gone
by
he
stood
a
little
at
one
side
affecting
to
raise
an
unmanageable
window
sash
they
were
all
unmanageable
but
in
reality
he
was
watching
her
and
i
must
confess
to
you
that
this
scene
contrasted
in
his
mind
with
the
elegant
home
which
his
wife
had
left
was
fast
taking
a
ludicrous
side
to
him
the
embarrassments
were
great
and
he
knew
that
they
would
thicken
upon
him
and
yet
the
desire
to
laugh
overcame
all
other
emotions
his
eyes
danced
and
he
bit
his
lips
to
restrain
their
mirth
but
at
last
when
ruth
turned
and
looked
at
him
the
expression
in
her
face
overcame
him
and
he
burst
forth
into
laughter
it
was
a
blessed
thing
for
ruth
that
she
was
able
to
join
him
sit
down
he
said
wheeling
the
gay
rocker
toward
her
i
am
sure
you
never
occupied
so
elegant
a
seat
before
there
is
a
great
gray
cat
belonging
to
the
establishment
who
usually
sits
in
state
here
but
she
has
evidently
vacated
in
your
favor
ruth
sank
into
the
chair
unable
to
speak
the
strangeness
of
it
all
and
the
conflicting
emotions
stirring
in
her
heart
fairly
took
away
the
power
of
speech
judge
burnham
came
and
stood
beside
her
we
have
entered
into
this
thing
ruth
he
said
and
his
voice
was
not
so
hard
as
it
had
been
and
there
are
embarrassments
enough
certainly
connected
with
it
and
yet
it
is
a
home
and
it
is
and
we
are
this
of
itself
is
joy
enough
to
atone
for
almost
she
was
about
to
answer
him
and
there
was
a
smile
on
her
face
in
the
midst
of
tears
in
her
eyes
but
they
were
interrupted
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
an
apparition
in
the
shape
of
a
child
perhaps
five
years
old
appeared
to
child
with
staring
blue
eyes
and
child
in
a
very
pink
dress
not
and
rather
short
child
with
bare
feet
and
with
her
arms
full
of
a
great
gray
cat
she
stared
amazingly
at
them
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
vanished
is
not
mine
at
least
judge
burnham
said
and
the
tone
in
which
he
said
it
was
irresistible
his
eyes
met
ruth
s
at
that
moment
and
all
traces
of
tears
had
disappeared
also
all
signs
of
sentiment
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
and
they
did
it
and
the
old
house
rang
with
peal
after
peal
of
uncontrollable
laughter
chapter
xix
my
daughters
the
room
to
which
judge
burnham
presently
escorted
his
bride
was
very
unlike
that
parlor
as
she
looked
about
her
on
the
exquisite
air
of
beauty
which
prevailed
and
the
evidences
of
refined
and
cultured
taste
scattered
with
lavish
hand
she
was
touched
with
the
thought
that
her
tastes
had
been
understood
and
remembered
in
each
minute
detail
how
very
lovely
this
is
she
said
as
her
foot
rested
on
the
soft
velvet
carpet
with
its
wildwood
vines
trailing
in
rich
colors
over
the
floor
i
knew
you
would
like
it
judge
burnham
said
with
a
gratified
smile
it
reminded
me
of
you
and
indeed
the
entire
room
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
full
of
your
presence
i
enjoyed
arranging
it
i
think
i
could
have
gratified
your
tastes
in
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
house
ruth
if
you
had
let
oh
i
know
you
could
she
answered
earnestly
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
trust
your
perhaps
i
made
a
mistake
but
i
meant
it
right
and
you
must
help
me
to
bring
right
out
of
she
did
not
realize
it
but
this
little
concession
to
his
possible
better
judgment
helped
her
husband
wonderfully
we
will
make
it
come
right
he
said
decidedly
and
now
i
will
leave
you
to
rest
a
little
while
i
go
down
and
discover
whether
this
house
is
inhabited
with
the
door
closing
after
him
seemed
to
go
much
of
ruth
s
courage
this
exquisite
room
was
a
rest
to
her
eyes
and
heart
but
it
contrasted
most
strangely
with
the
life
below
stairs
and
when
she
thought
of
that
room
below
it
reminded
her
of
all
there
was
yet
to
meet
and
endure
and
of
the
newness
of
the
way
and
the
untried
experiments
which
were
to
be
made
and
of
her
own
her
heart
trembled
and
almost
failed
her
yet
it
must
not
fail
her
she
get
strength
well
for
ruth
that
she
knew
in
what
place
to
seek
it
instead
of
taking
a
seat
in
the
and
which
invited
her
into
its
depths
she
turned
and
knelt
before
it
perhaps
after
all
there
are
more
dangerous
experiences
than
those
which
in
coming
to
a
new
home
to
take
up
new
responsibilities
lead
us
to
feel
our
utter
weakness
and
bring
us
on
our
knees
crying
to
the
strong
for
strength
judge
burnham
s
entrance
nearly
an
hour
afterward
found
ruth
resting
quietly
in
that
easy
chair
such
a
calm
on
her
face
and
such
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
regarded
her
with
a
expression
as
he
said
you
look
wonderfully
rested
i
think
my
easy
chair
must
be
a
success
will
you
come
down
now
to
a
supper
please
don
t
see
any
more
of
the
strange
things
than
you
can
help
i
tried
to
get
the
girls
to
come
up
and
so
avoid
some
of
the
horrors
of
a
meeting
below
stairs
but
they
are
too
thoroughly
alarmed
to
have
any
sense
at
all
and
i
had
to
abandon
that
poor
things
said
ruth
compassionately
am
i
so
very
formidable
it
must
be
dreadful
to
feel
frightened
at
people
i
can
t
imagine
the
he
surveyed
her
critically
then
laughed
he
had
some
conception
of
what
a
vision
she
would
be
to
the
people
she
had
not
changed
her
travelling
dress
which
was
of
rich
dark
silk
fitted
exquisitely
to
her
shapely
form
and
the
soft
laces
at
throat
and
wrist
brightened
only
by
a
knot
of
ribbon
of
the
most
delicate
tint
of
blue
completed
what
to
judge
burnham
s
cultured
taste
seemed
the
very
perfection
of
a
toilet
you
do
not
frighten
me
he
said
i
can
manage
to
look
at
you
without
being
overwhelmed
i
shall
not
answer
for
anybody
else
ruth
i
have
obeyed
you
to
the
very
letter
in
a
fit
of
something
very
like
vexation
i
resolved
not
to
lift
a
finger
to
change
the
customs
of
the
house
leaving
you
to
see
them
according
to
your
desire
as
they
were
the
result
is
we
haven
t
even
a
table
to
ourselves
the
whole
of
that
insufferable
family
cat
and
all
are
ready
to
gather
with
us
around
their
hospitable
board
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
was
so
very
literal
in
my
i
am
not
ruth
said
and
her
tone
was
quiet
and
had
a
sound
in
it
which
was
not
there
when
he
left
her
it
served
to
make
him
regard
her
again
curiously
then
they
went
to
the
kitchen
ruth
was
presently
seated
at
the
long
table
alarmingly
near
to
the
stove
which
had
cooked
the
potatoes
that
graced
the
evening
potatoes
served
in
their
original
coats
to
be
eaten
with
steel
forks
the
same
forks
expected
to
do
duty
in
the
mastication
of
a
huge
piece
of
indeed
she
did
as
her
husband
s
daughters
were
evidently
accustomed
to
doing
and
ate
it
with
her
knife
there
were
at
that
table
farmer
ferris
in
his
himself
redolent
of
the
barn
and
the
his
wife
in
a
new
stiff
blue
and
red
plaid
calico
most
manifestly
donned
to
do
honor
to
the
occasion
two
boys
belonging
to
the
ferris
household
in
different
degrees
of
disorder
and
the
aforesaid
apparition
in
pink
calico
the
gray
cat
still
hugged
to
her
heart
and
eating
milk
from
the
same
saucer
at
intervals
and
lastly
the
two
daughters
of
the
house
of
burnham
those
daughters
the
strongest
emotion
which
ruth
found
it
in
her
heart
to
have
for
them
on
this
first
evening
was
pity
she
had
never
imagined
anything
like
the
painful
embarrassment
which
they
felt
they
sat
on
the
edges
of
their
chairs
and
when
engaged
in
trying
to
eat
tilted
the
chairs
forward
to
reach
their
plates
and
rested
their
elbows
on
the
table
to
stare
when
they
dared
to
raise
their
frightened
eyes
to
do
so
their
father
had
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
in
a
way
which
was
likely
to
increase
their
painful
girls
he
had
said
and
his
voice
sounded
as
if
he
were
summoning
them
to
a
trial
by
jury
this
is
and
they
had
stood
up
and
essayed
to
make
little
bobbing
courtesies
after
the
fashion
of
fifty
years
ago
until
further
pressed
by
ferris
who
had
said
with
a
conscious
laugh
for
the
land
s
sake
girls
do
go
and
shake
hands
with
her
why
she
is
your
ma
but
judge
burnham
s
haughty
voice
had
come
to
the
rescue
if
you
please
we
will
excuse
them
from
that
ceremony
ferris
he
had
said
mrs
burnham
please
be
and
he
had
drawn
back
her
chair
with
the
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
and
the
inward
fury
of
a
lion
in
truth
judge
burnham
was
ashamed
of
and
angry
with
himself
and
i
am
glad
of
it
he
deserved
to
be
instead
of
asserting
his
authority
and
making
this
meeting
and
this
first
meal
together
strictly
a
family
matter
and
managing
a
dozen
other
little
details
which
he
could
have
managed
and
which
would
have
helped
wonderfully
he
had
angrily
resolved
to
let
everything
utterly
alone
and
bring
ruth
thus
sooner
and
more
decisively
to
seeing
the
folly
and
the
utter
untenableness
of
her
position
but
something
in
the
absolute
calm
of
her
face
this
calm
which
had
come
to
her
since
he
left
her
in
their
room
him
feel
it
to
be
more
than
probable
that
she
would
not
easily
nor
soon
abandon
the
position
which
she
had
assumed
the
ordeal
of
supper
was
gotten
through
with
easier
than
ruth
had
supposed
truth
to
tell
the
things
which
would
have
affected
most
persons
the
least
were
the
hardest
for
her
to
bear
she
had
not
entirely
risen
above
the
views
concerning
refinement
which
she
had
expressed
during
the
early
days
of
chautauqua
life
and
to
eat
with
a
knife
when
a
fork
should
be
used
and
to
have
a
steel
fork
instead
of
a
silver
one
and
to
have
no
napkin
at
all
were
to
her
positive
and
vivid
sources
of
from
which
she
could
not
altogether
turn
away
even
at
this
time
i
am
not
sure
however
that
in
the
trivialities
she
did
not
lose
some
of
the
real
trials
which
the
occasion
certainly
presented
directly
after
the
supper
was
concluded
with
but
a
very
poor
attempt
at
eating
on
ruth
s
part
judge
burnham
led
the
way
to
that
dreadful
parlor
interposing
his
stern
voice
between
the
evident
intention
of
the
daughters
to
remain
in
the
kitchen
i
desire
that
you
will
come
immediately
to
the
as
for
ruth
and
himself
they
did
not
retreat
promptly
enough
to
escape
ferris
for
the
land
s
sake
girls
do
go
quick
i
m
afraid
he
will
bite
you
next
time
i
wonder
if
she
is
as
awful
cross
as
he
is
she
looks
it
and
more
in
the
midst
of
all
the
tumult
of
thought
which
there
might
have
been
ruth
found
herself
trying
to
determine
which
was
the
most
objectional
expression
of
the
two
judge
erskine
s
favorite
land
alive
or
ferris
for
the
land
s
sake
where
do
americans
get
their
favorite
expletives
anyway
she
had
not
much
time
to
query
for
here
were
these
girls
sitting
each
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
solemn
chairs
and
looking
as
thoroughly
miserable
as
the
most
could
have
desired
what
was
she
to
say
to
them
or
would
it
be
more
merciful
to
say
nothing
at
all
ruth
felt
an
unutterable
pity
for
them
how
miserably
afraid
they
were
of
their
father
how
entirely
unnatural
it
seemed
and
it
could
not
be
that
he
had
ever
been
actually
unkind
to
them
it
was
just
a
system
of
severe
letting
alone
combined
with
the
unwisdom
of
the
ferris
tongue
which
had
developed
such
results
between
the
intervals
of
trying
to
say
a
few
words
to
them
words
which
they
answered
with
solemn
yes
ma
ams
ruth
tried
to
study
their
personal
appearance
it
was
far
from
prepossessing
yet
remembering
susan
and
the
marvelous
changes
which
the
dress
fitted
to
her
form
had
accomplished
wondered
how
much
of
their
painful
awkwardness
was
due
to
the
utter
unsuitability
of
their
attire
and
the
uncouth
arrangement
of
their
the
elder
of
the
two
was
tall
and
gaunt
with
pale
reddish
yellow
abundance
of
it
which
she
seemed
to
think
served
no
purpose
but
to
annoy
her
and
was
to
be
stretched
back
out
of
the
way
as
far
and
as
tightly
as
possible
her
shoulders
were
bent
and
stooping
her
pale
blue
eyes
looked
as
though
when
they
were
not
full
of
dismayed
embarrassment
they
were
listless
and
her
whole
manner
betokened
that
of
a
person
who
was
a
trial
to
herself
and
to
every
one
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
people
with
such
forms
and
faces
almost
invariably
manage
to
fit
themselves
out
in
clothing
which
shows
every
imperfection
to
advantage
this
girl
was
no
exception
indeed
she
seemed
to
have
succeeded
in
making
an
exceptional
fright
of
herself
her
dress
was
of
the
color
and
material
which
seemed
to
increase
her
height
and
bore
the
marks
of
a
novice
in
about
every
part
of
it
to
increase
the
effect
it
was
much
too
short
for
her
and
showed
to
immense
disadvantage
a
pair
of
strong
thick
country
boots
which
might
have
been
excellent
for
tramping
over
plowed
ground
in
wet
weather
the
younger
sister
was
a
complete
contrast
in
every
respect
her
form
can
only
be
described
by
that
expressive
and
not
very
elegant
word
from
her
thick
short
hair
down
to
her
feet
she
seemed
to
be
almost
equally
shapeless
and
graceless
fat
red
cheeks
small
round
eyes
shining
out
from
layers
of
fat
large
hands
remarkably
large
feet
apparently
or
else
her
shoes
were
and
arrayed
in
a
large
plaided
dress
of
red
and
green
which
was
much
too
low
in
the
neck
and
much
too
and
was
absolutely
uncouth
swiftly
silently
ruth
took
in
all
these
details
and
she
took
in
also
what
her
husband
had
never
a
large
portion
of
this
uncouthness
was
due
to
the
outward
adornings
or
disguisings
which
is
what
persons
devoid
of
taste
sometimes
succeed
in
making
of
their
dress
in
the
midst
of
her
musings
there
came
to
her
a
new
idea
it
dawned
upon
her
in
the
form
of
a
question
why
should
she
a
lady
of
fashion
and
of
leisure
and
of
such
cultured
taste
that
she
was
an
acknowledged
authority
among
her
friends
on
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
esthetic
be
in
so
marked
a
manner
for
the
second
time
in
her
short
life
brought
face
to
face
with
that
form
of
which
troubled
her
the
most
not
only
face
to
face
with
it
but
put
in
such
a
position
that
it
was
her
duty
to
endure
it
patiently
and
show
kindly
interest
in
the
victims
was
it
possible
and
this
thought
flashed
upon
her
like
a
she
had
been
wont
to
make
too
much
of
this
matter
that
she
had
allowed
the
lack
of
culture
in
these
directions
to
press
her
too
sorely
now
do
you
know
that
this
was
the
first
time
such
a
possibility
had
dawned
on
ruth
burnham
so
insensible
had
been
her
yielding
to
the
temptation
which
wealth
and
leisure
brings
to
give
too
much
thought
and
too
high
a
place
to
these
questions
of
dress
and
taste
that
as
i
say
she
had
not
been
conscious
of
any
sin
in
that
direction
while
those
who
looked
on
at
her
life
had
been
able
to
see
it
plainly
and
in
exaggerated
form
i
suspect
dear
friend
that
you
at
this
moment
are
the
victim
of
some
inconsistency
which
your
neighbor
sees
plainly
and
which
possibly
injures
your
influence
over
her
and
you
are
not
conscious
of
its
development
now
that
is
a
solemn
thought
as
well
as
a
perplexing
one
for
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
cleanse
thou
me
from
secret
faults
prayed
the
inspired
writer
may
he
not
have
meant
those
faults
so
secret
that
it
takes
the
voice
of
god
to
reveal
them
to
our
hearts
at
least
to
ruth
burnham
sitting
there
in
that
rocker
looking
at
her
husband
s
daughters
the
thought
came
like
the
voice
of
god
s
spirit
in
her
heart
she
had
come
very
near
to
that
revealing
spirit
during
the
last
two
he
had
made
his
presence
known
to
her
she
was
in
a
hushed
mood
desiring
to
be
led
and
she
plainly
saw
that
even
this
exhibition
of
uncouthness
could
be
a
discipline
to
her
soul
if
she
would
but
allow
its
voice
you
are
not
to
understand
that
she
therefore
concluded
uncouthness
and
utter
disregard
of
refined
tastes
to
be
necessary
outgrowths
of
christian
experience
or
to
be
in
the
least
necessary
to
a
higher
development
of
christian
life
she
merely
had
a
glimpse
of
what
it
meant
to
be
in
a
state
of
using
this
world
as
not
abusing
it
the
thought
quickened
her
resolutions
in
regard
to
those
neglected
girls
thus
thrown
under
her
care
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
toned
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
them
i
believe
it
not
irreverent
to
say
that
the
very
subject
upon
which
she
first
addressed
them
was
chosen
for
her
all
unconsciously
to
herself
by
that
spirit
to
whom
nothing
that
an
immortal
soul
can
say
appears
trivial
because
he
sees
the
waves
of
influence
which
are
stirred
years
ahead
by
the
quiet
words
just
what
the
two
frightened
girls
expected
from
her
would
have
been
perhaps
difficult
for
even
themselves
to
explain
for
years
all
their
intercourse
with
their
father
had
consisted
in
a
series
of
irritated
lectures
delivered
in
a
sharp
key
on
his
part
and
received
in
a
frightened
silence
by
them
he
had
been
utterly
disappointed
with
them
in
every
respect
and
he
had
not
failed
to
show
it
and
they
had
not
failed
to
seek
for
sympathy
by
pouring
the
story
of
their
grievances
into
ferris
willing
ears
the
result
was
that
she
had
but
increased
their
terror
in
and
doubt
of
their
father
added
to
this
she
had
all
the
ignorant
superstition
of
her
class
in
regard
to
if
indeed
the
views
of
this
sort
of
people
shall
be
called
by
no
harsher
name
than
superstition
the
had
been
during
the
last
week
most
freely
discussed
in
the
ferris
household
and
the
result
had
been
what
might
have
been
expected
therefore
it
was
with
unfeigned
amazement
and
with
the
demonstrations
of
prolonged
stares
that
ruth
s
first
suddenly
spoken
sentence
broke
the
silence
which
the
others
were
feeling
keenly
your
hair
looks
as
though
it
would
curl
naturally
did
you
ever
try
it
this
to
the
elder
girl
whose
whole
face
reddened
under
the
astonishment
produced
by
the
query
and
who
as
i
said
could
only
stare
for
a
moment
then
she
said
yes
ma
am
i
did
once
long
time
and
didn
t
you
like
the
appearance
a
more
vivid
blush
and
a
conscious
laugh
was
the
answer
then
she
added
why
yes
well
enough
but
it
was
such
a
bother
and
nobody
to
oh
it
is
very
little
burnham
answered
lightly
when
you
understand
just
how
to
manage
it
i
think
natural
curls
are
chapter
xx
a
sister
needed
some
vigorous
planning
was
done
that
night
which
followed
ruth
burnham
s
introduction
to
her
new
home
it
was
not
restless
planning
neither
could
it
be
said
to
be
about
new
things
for
these
things
ruth
had
studied
every
day
since
the
first
week
of
her
engagement
and
the
summer
which
was
in
its
then
was
fading
now
so
she
had
before
but
something
had
given
her
thoughts
new
strength
and
force
ruth
believed
it
to
be
that
hour
which
she
had
spent
alone
on
her
knees
she
had
spent
many
an
hour
before
that
alone
on
her
knees
but
never
had
the
power
of
the
unseen
presence
taken
such
hold
upon
her
as
at
that
time
she
had
felt
her
own
powerlessness
as
had
not
been
given
to
feeling
it
and
you
know
it
is
man
s
extremity
that
is
god
s
it
was
before
the
hour
of
breakfast
that
she
commenced
the
process
of
developing
some
of
her
plans
to
her
husband
how
long
will
it
take
to
dispose
of
the
ferris
family
she
asked
him
and
her
voice
was
so
calm
so
full
of
strength
and
conscious
determination
that
it
rested
him
it
can
be
done
just
as
soon
as
your
genius
combined
with
my
executive
ability
can
bring
it
to
pass
he
answered
laughing
and
i
sincerely
hope
and
trust
that
you
will
be
brilliant
and
rapid
in
your
display
of
but
judge
burnham
ought
they
to
have
warning
as
we
do
with
servants
a
week
s
warning
i
trust
not
i
should
not
promise
to
endure
a
week
of
it
oh
they
are
prepared
i
broadly
hinted
to
them
that
the
mistress
would
want
the
house
to
herself
if
they
had
not
felt
the
necessity
of
being
here
to
welcome
you
it
could
have
been
managed
before
this
they
have
their
plans
formed
i
believe
and
as
soon
as
you
want
to
manage
without
them
i
will
make
it
for
their
interest
to
be
in
ruth
turned
toward
him
with
a
relieved
smile
and
an
eager
air
could
you
manage
then
to
make
it
to
their
interest
to
go
before
breakfast
or
shall
we
have
to
wait
until
that
meal
is
over
he
laughed
gayly
your
energy
is
refreshing
he
said
especially
when
it
is
bestowed
in
such
a
worthy
cause
no
i
think
we
will
have
to
wait
until
after
breakfast
but
ruth
are
you
really
in
earnest
do
you
actually
mean
to
settle
down
here
in
this
house
as
it
is
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
help
and
everything
before
she
answered
she
came
over
and
stood
beside
him
slipping
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
speaking
in
tender
earnestness
judge
burnham
i
want
you
to
understand
me
i
feel
that
i
may
have
seemed
hard
and
cold
and
selfish
perhaps
i
have
been
selfish
in
pushing
my
plan
i
think
i
have
been
but
i
did
not
intend
it
for
selfishness
i
was
and
am
led
by
what
seems
to
be
and
mine
those
girls
of
yours
have
been
neglected
i
can
see
how
you
being
a
man
would
not
know
what
to
do
at
the
same
time
i
can
see
how
i
being
a
woman
can
at
least
to
do
many
things
and
i
am
very
eager
to
try
you
may
call
it
an
experiment
if
you
will
and
if
it
is
in
your
estimation
in
six
months
from
now
an
utter
failure
i
will
give
it
up
and
do
exactly
as
you
there
was
a
gleam
of
assurance
in
her
eyes
and
he
could
see
that
she
did
not
believe
he
would
ever
be
called
upon
to
follow
plans
but
something
tender
and
pleading
in
her
tone
touched
him
and
he
said
with
feeling
i
begin
to
realize
forcibly
what
has
only
come
upon
me
in
touches
i
have
not
done
my
duty
by
the
girls
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
used
to
study
the
question
and
try
to
plan
it
but
i
can
not
tell
you
how
utterly
hopeless
it
seemed
to
me
finally
i
gave
it
up
i
determined
that
nothing
could
ever
be
done
but
to
support
them
and
live
away
from
them
and
long
before
i
knew
you
i
determined
on
that
as
my
line
of
action
so
your
resolution
was
a
surprise
to
overwhelming
one
but
perhaps
you
are
right
at
least
i
will
help
you
in
whatever
way
i
can
to
carry
out
plans
however
wild
they
are
and
i
begin
to
realize
that
you
may
possibly
have
some
very
wild
ones
but
i
promise
good
said
ruth
with
sparkling
eyes
i
ask
nothing
better
than
that
then
we
will
proceed
at
once
to
business
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
that
i
don
t
feel
like
taking
a
wedding
journey
just
now
we
can
enjoy
it
so
much
more
when
we
get
our
house
in
order
there
are
certain
things
that
i
need
to
know
at
once
first
how
much
or
how
little
is
there
to
be
done
to
this
house
to
everything
in
other
words
how
much
money
am
i
to
spend
oh
he
said
looking
relieved
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ask
me
what
ought
to
be
done
to
make
the
place
habitable
and
really
i
hardly
know
where
to
commence
i
shall
be
charmed
to
leave
it
in
your
hands
as
to
money
i
think
i
may
safely
promise
you
what
you
need
unless
your
ideas
are
on
a
more
magnificent
scale
than
i
think
i
will
give
you
my
check
this
morning
for
a
thousand
dollars
and
when
that
is
used
you
may
come
to
me
for
as
much
more
is
that
an
answer
to
your
question
an
entirely
satisfactory
she
answered
him
with
shining
eyes
and
they
went
down
to
breakfast
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
which
considering
the
surroundings
and
the
marvelous
calicoes
in
which
the
daughters
of
the
house
appeared
was
surprising
i
don
t
see
the
way
clear
to
results
judge
burnham
said
perplexedly
as
he
and
his
wife
walked
on
the
piazza
after
breakfast
and
continued
the
discussion
of
ways
and
means
if
the
ferris
tribe
vacate
as
i
have
just
intimated
to
the
head
of
the
family
is
extremely
desirable
what
are
you
to
do
for
help
until
such
time
as
something
competent
in
that
line
can
be
secured
always
supposing
that
there
such
a
thing
in
existence
i
remember
what
an
experience
you
have
been
having
in
your
father
s
house
in
the
line
of
oh
well
said
ruth
brightly
we
had
the
you
know
that
makes
a
difference
they
have
excellent
servants
there
now
and
indeed
we
generally
have
had
my
housekeeping
troubles
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
i
have
a
plan
i
don
t
know
what
you
will
think
of
it
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
very
much
surprised
no
i
shall
not
he
interrupted
her
to
say
i
have
gotten
beyond
the
condition
of
surprise
at
anything
which
you
may
do
or
then
she
went
on
with
her
story
i
thought
it
all
over
last
night
and
if
she
will
do
it
i
think
i
see
my
way
clear
and
i
am
almost
sure
she
will
for
really
i
never
knew
a
more
unselfish
girl
in
my
i
dare
say
her
husband
said
regarding
her
with
an
amused
air
perhaps
i
might
agree
with
you
if
you
will
enlighten
me
as
to
which
of
the
patterns
of
domestic
unselfishness
you
have
in
mind
did
she
reign
in
your
household
since
my
knowledge
of
it
began
oh
i
am
not
speaking
of
help
ruth
said
and
a
vivid
flush
brightened
her
cheeks
i
was
thinking
of
my
sister
it
is
her
help
i
have
in
susan
he
exclaimed
and
then
was
suddenly
silent
his
face
showed
that
after
all
she
had
surprised
him
there
was
much
talk
about
it
after
that
and
the
discussion
finally
ended
in
their
taking
passage
in
the
about
which
judge
burnham
had
spoken
the
day
before
and
jogging
together
to
the
train
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
that
ruth
had
not
the
patience
to
wait
until
another
day
besides
their
departure
would
give
the
ferris
family
a
chance
to
hasten
movements
on
the
way
to
the
cars
judge
burnham
mentally
resolved
that
his
first
leisure
moments
should
be
spent
in
selecting
horses
and
a
driver
since
he
was
to
become
a
country
gentleman
whether
he
would
or
not
it
became
him
to
look
out
for
conveniences
seated
again
in
the
train
and
made
comfortable
by
her
watchful
husband
ruth
took
time
to
smile
over
the
variety
of
experiences
through
which
she
had
gone
during
the
less
than
hours
since
she
sat
there
before
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
lived
a
little
and
learned
a
great
deal
and
it
seemed
a
wonderful
thing
that
she
was
actually
going
to
susan
erskine
with
a
petition
for
help
who
could
have
supposed
that
ruth
erskine
would
ever
have
reached
such
a
period
in
her
history
that
she
would
turn
to
her
as
the
only
a
available
source
of
supply
and
comfort
a
great
deal
of
thinking
can
be
done
in
one
night
and
ruth
had
lain
awake
and
gone
over
her
ground
with
steady
gaze
and
a
determined
heart
it
surprised
her
that
things
had
not
looked
plainer
to
her
before
why
couldn
t
i
have
seen
this
way
yesterday
before
i
left
home
she
asked
herself
but
the
wonder
was
that
she
had
seen
it
thus
early
very
much
surprised
were
the
erskine
household
to
see
their
bride
of
less
than
hours
standing
appear
while
they
still
lingered
over
their
we
live
in
the
country
you
know
was
ruth
s
composed
explanation
of
the
early
advent
country
people
are
up
hours
before
town
people
have
stirred
i
always
knew
land
alive
said
judge
erskine
and
then
for
a
whole
minute
she
was
silent
she
confided
to
ruth
long
afterward
that
for
about
five
minutes
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
for
she
surely
thought
they
had
quarrelled
and
parted
though
i
thought
at
the
time
she
explained
that
if
you
got
sick
of
it
a
ready
you
wouldn
t
have
come
back
together
and
have
walked
into
the
in
that
friendly
fashion
but
then
i
remembered
that
you
never
did
things
like
anybody
else
in
this
world
and
if
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
come
back
home
again
and
leave
your
husband
you
would
be
sure
to
pick
out
a
way
of
doing
it
that
no
other
mortal
would
ever
have
thought
of
i
am
going
to
my
room
ruth
said
presently
judge
burnham
i
will
hasten
and
be
ready
to
go
down
town
with
you
in
a
very
little
while
susan
will
you
come
with
me
please
i
want
to
talk
to
and
susan
arose
with
alacrity
a
pleasant
smile
lighting
her
plain
face
there
was
a
sound
of
sisterliness
in
the
tone
which
she
had
watched
and
waited
for
but
rarely
heard
i
have
come
on
the
strangest
errand
ruth
said
dropping
into
her
own
favorite
chair
as
the
door
of
her
old
room
closed
after
them
i
feel
as
if
i
were
at
least
a
year
older
than
i
was
yesterday
i
have
thought
so
much
first
of
all
susan
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
have
found
something
i
have
come
close
to
mean
he
has
come
close
to
me
he
has
almost
shown
me
himself
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
about
it
and
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
anything
to
but
it
is
a
great
deal
to
have
experienced
i
seem
to
have
heard
him
say
come
to
why
do
you
struggle
and
plan
and
toss
yourself
about
haven
t
i
promised
you
and
susan
i
do
believe
he
spoke
to
my
heart
why
not
why
not
indeed
said
susan
when
he
has
repeated
the
message
so
many
times
ruth
i
am
glad
then
ruth
ran
rapidly
from
that
subject
to
less
important
ones
giving
her
sister
a
picture
in
brief
of
the
new
home
closing
with
the
sentence
now
i
am
in
a
dilemma
i
can
t
keep
any
of
the
ferris
family
for
an
hour
and
i
can
t
introduce
new
servants
until
things
are
in
different
shape
and
i
can
t
get
them
into
different
shape
until
i
have
help
do
you
see
what
i
am
to
do
yes
said
susan
with
a
bright
smile
you
need
a
sister
one
who
knows
how
to
help
in
all
household
matters
and
yet
who
knows
how
to
keep
her
tongue
reasonably
quiet
as
to
what
she
found
i
know
how
servants
gossip
some
of
them
that
rosie
we
had
for
a
week
tried
to
tell
me
things
about
blakeman
s
kitchen
that
would
make
her
feel
like
fainting
if
she
knew
it
a
sister
is
just
exactly
what
you
need
in
this
emergency
will
you
let
her
step
into
the
gap
and
show
you
how
nicely
she
can
fill
it
you
ruth
asked
eagerly
that
is
just
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
say
though
i
didn
t
like
to
say
it
for
fear
you
would
misunderstand
not
realize
you
know
that
it
is
because
we
don
t
want
to
go
out
of
the
for
assistance
just
now
that
we
needed
you
so
recognized
at
last
in
as
a
member
of
the
family
an
unpremeditated
sentence
evidently
from
the
heart
it
was
what
susan
erskine
had
been
patiently
biding
her
time
and
waiting
for
it
had
come
sooner
than
she
expected
it
made
her
cheeks
glow
i
will
go
home
with
you
at
once
she
said
in
a
way
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
the
machinery
of
this
house
is
in
running
order
again
that
new
second
girl
is
a
treasure
ruth
and
by
the
way
she
has
a
sister
who
might
develop
into
a
treasure
for
you
now
let
me
see
if
i
understand
things
what
do
you
want
to
do
first
first
said
ruth
smiling
i
need
to
go
shopping
it
is
my
you
know
i
like
to
buy
things
and
at
last
there
is
certainly
occasion
for
my
buying
susan
you
have
no
idea
how
much
is
wanted
everything
in
every
line
is
necessary
and
judge
burnham
has
left
all
to
me
we
need
and
painters
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
of
course
he
will
attend
to
those
things
our
plan
is
to
return
with
a
load
of
necessities
judge
burnham
is
going
to
hire
a
team
at
once
and
have
it
loaded
but
what
the
first
necessities
where
shall
i
begin
begin
with
a
pencil
and
paper
said
susan
seizing
upon
them
and
seating
herself
now
let
us
be
methodical
my
teacher
in
mathematics
once
told
me
that
i
was
nothing
if
i
was
not
methodical
kitchen
because
we
shall
have
to
eat
even
before
we
get
the
house
in
order
what
is
a
necessity
to
that
table
before
you
can
have
a
comfortable
meal
then
they
plunged
into
business
two
women
thoroughly
in
earnest
pencil
and
paper
in
hand
bank
check
in
pocket
organization
well
developed
in
both
of
them
and
the
need
of
speed
apparent
can
accomplish
surprising
things
in
the
way
of
plans
in
an
hour
of
time
especially
when
one
is
persistently
methodical
when
burnham
arose
and
drew
her
wrap
around
her
preparatory
to
joining
the
husband
who
was
waiting
below
she
felt
as
though
a
week
s
work
had
been
accomplished
besides
they
had
been
cheery
together
these
in
a
different
mood
toward
each
other
from
what
had
ever
appeared
before
susan
was
so
sensible
so
so
as
to
what
needed
doing
first
and
as
to
ways
of
doing
the
soonest
and
withal
her
way
of
saying
we
when
she
spoke
of
the
work
to
arrange
made
her
appear
such
a
tower
of
strength
to
ruth
who
knew
so
well
her
own
delinquencies
in
the
direction
of
housework
and
who
had
thoroughly
tested
susan
s
practical
knowledge
land
alive
ejaculated
erskine
when
after
ruth
s
departure
the
new
arrangements
were
presented
to
her
for
approval
who
would
have
thought
she
would
have
to
come
after
you
in
less
than
a
day
after
she
set
out
to
do
for
herself
so
capable
as
she
is
too
though
i
don
t
suppose
she
knows
much
more
than
a
kitten
about
housework
how
should
she
well
i
m
glad
i
had
you
learn
all
them
things
what
we
d
have
done
this
winter
if
i
hadn
t
is
more
than
can
see
through
well
well
child
i
don
t
know
how
we
are
going
to
get
along
without
you
your
pa
sets
great
store
by
you
i
can
see
it
every
day
and
what
if
i
should
have
another
turn
of
sick
headache
while
you
re
gone
though
for
that
matter
i
don
t
believe
i
will
i
guess
going
through
the
cured
them
headaches
i
ain
t
had
one
since
and
so
she
needs
you
right
off
well
poor
thing
i
don
t
know
what
she
do
without
you
i
m
sure
them
girls
ain
t
efficient
i
dare
say
girls
never
are
you
learn
em
how
susan
you
can
do
it
if
anybody
can
and
that
ll
be
doing
em
a
good
susan
discreetly
kept
her
own
counsel
about
them
girls
and
quietly
and
swiftly
packed
her
satchel
not
without
an
exultant
song
at
her
heart
this
beautiful
sister
whose
love
she
had
craved
seemed
very
near
to
her
this
morning
chapter
xxi
trying
questions
you
are
to
imagine
much
that
was
done
inside
that
long
low
house
on
the
hill
during
the
next
three
weeks
a
great
deal
can
be
done
in
three
weeks
time
what
actually
accomplished
would
fill
a
volume
so
it
is
well
that
you
are
to
imagine
instead
of
read
about
it
a
great
many
wheels
of
progress
were
started
during
that
very
first
among
the
stores
judge
burnham
among
the
painters
and
draymen
susan
in
the
erskine
attic
sorting
out
and
packing
many
things
that
according
to
judge
erskine
s
orders
were
ruth
s
exclusive
property
by
the
time
the
five
o
clock
train
received
the
three
they
were
tired
and
satisfied
tired
though
they
were
it
was
as
late
as
midnight
before
all
the
household
settled
into
rest
susan
dropped
into
her
place
as
naturally
as
though
it
had
been
waiting
for
her
all
these
years
the
ferris
family
were
departed
bag
and
baggage
and
the
two
burnhams
left
behind
were
and
disconsolate
why
not
the
ferrises
were
the
only
friends
they
had
ever
known
susan
put
a
sympathetic
arm
around
one
and
kissed
the
other
before
she
had
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
and
ruth
remembered
with
dismay
that
she
had
not
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
and
indeed
if
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
concerning
her
it
seemed
almost
an
impossible
thing
to
do
she
had
been
for
so
many
years
in
the
habit
of
bestowing
her
kisses
rarely
and
to
such
an
exceedingly
limited
number
of
persons
then
they
betook
themselves
susan
and
seraphina
to
the
kitchen
confusion
reigned
so
it
did
all
over
the
house
except
in
the
purity
of
ruth
s
two
rooms
but
before
midnight
there
was
a
comfortable
place
for
susan
to
sleep
and
most
satisfactory
preparations
in
line
for
a
breakfast
the
next
morning
it
was
that
next
morning
which
gave
the
two
burnham
girls
their
first
touch
of
a
cultured
home
there
was
a
little
room
conveniently
situated
as
regarded
the
kitchen
which
the
instinct
of
taste
had
made
ruth
select
at
the
first
glance
as
a
thither
she
and
susan
repaired
early
in
the
evening
to
make
a
survey
it
needs
painting
said
susan
scanning
the
critically
and
papering
and
then
with
a
pretty
carpet
it
will
be
just
the
thing
but
in
the
meantime
it
is
clean
and
we
can
set
the
here
morning
can
t
we
if
we
can
get
it
in
here
to
set
ruth
answered
in
a
dubious
tone
it
is
a
long
table
and
none
of
furniture
will
be
here
you
oh
i
see
my
way
out
of
that
there
is
a
little
table
in
that
pantry
or
or
whatever
is
the
name
of
it
that
will
do
nicely
for
a
until
we
get
settled
and
ruth
shall
we
have
some
of
my
muffins
for
breakfast
you
remember
judge
burnham
used
to
like
them
when
we
gave
them
to
him
occasionally
for
tea
oh
girls
i
can
make
delicious
muffins
and
if
you
are
both
down
here
by
six
o
clock
morning
i
will
teach
you
how
the
first
thing
i
this
last
to
the
two
bewildered
girls
who
stood
waiting
to
see
what
astonishing
thing
would
happen
next
as
for
ruth
she
went
to
that
gem
of
a
room
smiling
over
the
strangeness
of
the
thought
that
susan
was
in
their
kitchen
hers
and
judge
burnham
s
planning
with
his
daughters
to
have
muffins
for
breakfast
also
she
thought
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
of
the
great
trunk
packed
with
silver
rare
old
pieces
of
her
mother
s
own
which
had
been
held
sacred
for
her
during
all
these
years
and
of
the
smaller
and
newer
trunk
containing
table
drapery
which
was
a
marvel
of
fineness
and
whiteness
both
trunks
had
journeyed
hither
several
days
ago
and
had
this
night
been
opened
to
secure
certain
things
which
susan
s
morning
plans
had
called
for
so
it
was
to
the
little
room
that
the
family
came
the
next
morning
with
its
south
window
into
which
the
september
sun
slanted
its
rays
cheerily
the
room
itself
was
carpetless
and
the
chairs
were
wooden
and
there
was
no
other
attempt
at
furniture
but
the
table
laid
in
snowy
whiteness
and
the
napkins
large
and
fine
and
of
delicate
pattern
and
the
silver
service
gleaming
before
ruth
s
place
and
the
silver
forks
and
solid
silver
spoons
and
the
glittering
goblets
and
delicate
susan
had
actually
unpacked
and
washed
and
arranged
ruth
s
mother
s
say
nothing
of
the
aroma
of
coffee
floating
in
the
air
and
mingling
not
unpleasantly
with
the
whiff
of
a
vase
of
autumn
roses
which
blushed
before
ruth
s
plate
all
these
things
were
a
lesson
in
home
refinements
such
as
a
week
of
talking
would
never
have
accomplished
and
which
the
burnham
girls
sat
down
to
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
it
was
curious
to
notice
the
effect
on
them
their
conspicuous
calicoes
and
hair
and
ungainly
shoes
were
still
painfully
visible
but
for
the
first
time
apparently
it
dawned
upon
them
that
things
didn
t
match
they
surveyed
the
table
which
was
as
a
picture
to
them
and
then
with
instinctive
movements
essayed
to
hide
their
awkward
shoes
under
their
too
short
dresses
and
blushed
painfully
over
the
impossibility
of
doing
so
ruth
noticed
it
and
smiled
they
would
be
ready
for
her
hand
she
fancied
when
she
came
to
an
hour
of
leisure
to
arrange
for
them
that
breakfast
scene
was
a
cheery
one
so
much
of
home
had
already
entered
into
its
elements
that
judge
burnham
cordially
pronounced
susan
a
fairy
and
she
as
genially
responded
that
she
was
a
most
substantial
one
and
had
had
two
substantial
helpers
with
a
meaning
glance
toward
the
girls
indeed
he
said
in
kindly
tone
and
then
he
glanced
toward
them
that
was
a
very
pleasant
way
of
showing
the
contrast
between
this
breakfast
and
the
one
to
which
they
sat
down
but
the
morning
before
was
certainly
very
striking
and
though
the
girls
blushed
painfully
the
tone
in
which
he
had
spoken
and
the
glance
which
accompanied
his
remark
did
more
for
those
daughters
than
all
their
father
s
lectures
had
accomplished
directly
the
muffins
and
the
broiled
steak
and
the
amber
coffee
were
discussed
and
the
meal
concluded
business
in
that
house
commenced
thereafter
it
was
a
scene
of
organized
disorder
the
girls
under
susan
s
lead
proved
notwithstanding
judge
erskine
s
surmise
very
efficient
helpers
they
could
not
enter
a
room
properly
they
could
not
use
the
king
s
english
very
well
and
they
knew
nothing
about
the
multitude
of
little
accomplishments
with
which
the
girls
of
their
age
usually
consume
time
but
it
transpired
that
they
could
wash
windows
and
paints
and
sweep
walls
and
even
nail
carpets
they
were
both
and
skillful
over
many
of
these
employments
and
the
hearty
laugh
which
occasionally
rung
out
from
their
vicinity
when
susan
was
with
them
showed
plainly
that
they
had
lost
their
fear
of
her
but
their
embarrassment
where
either
their
father
or
ruth
was
concerned
did
not
decrease
and
indeed
in
the
whirl
of
plans
which
had
recently
come
upon
them
these
two
had
little
leisure
to
cultivate
the
daughters
acquaintance
ruth
after
a
few
attempts
at
helping
discreetly
left
the
ordering
of
the
hired
helpers
to
susan
s
skillful
hands
and
accompanied
her
husband
on
daily
shopping
excursions
where
her
good
taste
and
good
sense
were
equally
called
into
action
in
the
course
of
time
and
when
there
is
a
full
purse
to
command
skillful
helpers
the
time
need
not
be
so
very
long
drawn
out
there
came
a
morning
when
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
to
have
walked
with
judge
burnham
and
his
wife
through
the
reconstructed
house
nothing
showy
nothing
really
expensive
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
fashionable
world
had
been
attempted
ruth
s
tastes
were
too
well
cultured
for
that
she
knew
perfectly
that
what
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
lofty
ceilings
and
massive
windows
of
her
father
s
house
would
be
ridiculously
out
of
place
here
as
you
passed
with
her
from
room
to
room
you
would
have
realized
that
nothing
looked
out
of
place
perhaps
in
the
girl
s
room
as
much
thought
had
been
expended
as
in
any
place
in
that
house
ruth
had
been
amazed
not
to
say
horrified
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
to
their
room
to
find
that
it
was
carpetless
curtainless
and
i
had
almost
said
furnitureless
an
bedstead
destitute
of
any
pretense
of
beauty
and
a
stand
holding
a
tin
basin
and
a
milk
pitcher
to
ruth
whose
one
experience
of
life
had
to
do
with
her
father
s
carefully
furnished
house
where
the
servants
rooms
were
well
supplied
with
the
comforts
to
say
nothing
of
the
luxuries
of
the
toilet
this
looked
simply
barbarous
judge
burnham
too
was
shocked
and
subdued
it
had
been
years
since
he
had
been
a
caller
in
his
daughters
room
and
he
had
seemed
to
think
that
magic
of
some
sort
must
have
supplied
their
wants
i
furnished
money
whenever
it
was
asked
for
he
said
regarding
ruth
with
a
sort
of
appealing
air
now
that
i
think
of
it
they
were
never
extravagant
in
their
demands
but
i
supposed
i
gave
them
enough
at
least
when
i
thought
about
it
at
all
i
assured
myself
that
the
ferrises
would
certainly
not
be
afraid
to
ask
for
more
if
more
was
the
difficulty
with
the
ferris
family
was
that
they
had
no
tastes
to
expend
money
for
ruth
said
quietly
but
you
can
not
wonder
that
the
girls
are
not
just
what
we
would
like
to
see
them
they
certainly
have
had
no
surroundings
of
any
sort
that
would
educate
them
in
your
after
this
talk
he
entered
with
heartiness
into
the
plans
for
that
room
and
when
the
delicate
blue
and
pale
gold
carpet
was
it
reminded
one
of
a
sunset
in
a
pure
the
white
drapery
was
looped
with
blue
ribbons
rural
fashion
and
the
china
was
gracefully
disposed
on
the
toilet
case
and
the
was
adorned
with
all
the
little
daintinesses
which
ruth
understood
so
well
how
to
scatter
even
to
a
blue
and
gold
vase
full
of
blossoms
and
the
pretty
cottage
bedstead
was
luxuriously
draped
in
spotless
white
plump
pillows
ruffled
pillow
shams
all
complete
ruth
stood
back
and
surveyed
the
entire
effect
with
the
most
intense
satisfaction
what
said
the
girls
well
they
nothing
but
their
blazing
cheeks
and
suspiciously
wet
eyes
looked
volumes
and
for
several
days
they
stepped
about
that
room
in
a
tiptoe
fashion
which
would
have
amused
ruth
had
she
seen
it
they
could
not
rally
from
the
feeling
that
everything
about
them
was
so
delicate
and
pure
that
to
breathe
upon
or
touch
would
be
to
mar
a
work
of
art
meantime
other
matters
had
been
progressing
ruth
had
lain
awake
half
of
one
night
and
studied
the
immortal
question
of
dress
she
had
met
and
battled
with
and
conquered
half
a
dozen
forms
of
pride
and
then
had
boldly
announced
at
the
next
morning
s
the
following
judge
burnham
the
girls
and
i
want
to
go
to
the
city
to
attend
to
some
shall
we
go
in
that
or
how
before
this
i
should
have
explained
to
you
that
judge
burnham
had
been
for
some
days
in
an
active
state
of
trying
horses
examining
carriages
and
interviewing
professional
drivers
also
several
horses
and
carriages
had
waited
on
them
for
trial
so
that
ruth
had
taken
several
rides
to
the
cars
on
trial
and
had
once
suggested
that
perhaps
it
would
be
as
economical
a
way
of
keeping
a
carriage
as
any
this
spending
the
season
in
making
a
choice
therefore
judge
burnham
laughed
as
he
answered
why
no
there
is
to
be
a
trial
span
here
in
time
for
the
ten
o
clock
train
i
was
about
to
propose
a
ride
in
honor
of
that
occasion
are
you
going
into
town
for
the
day
ruth
laughed
for
the
week
i
am
afraid
we
shall
probably
be
detained
at
the
dressmaker
s
for
some
time
and
after
that
i
have
many
errands
to
now
the
form
in
which
her
pride
had
met
her
last
was
the
shrinking
from
going
to
town
and
above
all
going
to
the
fashionable
and
millinery
establishments
with
those
companions
for
a
critical
survey
of
their
wardrobe
revealed
the
fact
that
they
had
nothing
which
she
considered
decent
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
taken
the
subject
into
consideration
on
the
contrary
it
had
been
present
with
her
during
her
shopping
excursions
and
she
had
blessed
the
instinct
which
enabled
her
to
see
at
a
glance
just
what
shade
or
tint
would
suit
the
opposite
complexions
of
the
two
girls
she
had
visited
her
dressmaker
and
made
arrangements
with
her
for
service
but
the
question
had
been
whether
she
could
not
smuggle
them
off
in
some
way
to
a
quieter
street
among
the
less
fashionable
workers
and
secure
for
them
a
respectable
outfit
in
which
to
appear
at
madame
delfort
s
it
was
over
these
and
kindred
plans
that
she
had
lain
awake
and
finally
abandoned
them
all
and
resolved
upon
outright
unconcern
in
regard
to
what
others
might
say
or
think
nevertheless
she
winced
when
the
two
girls
came
down
arrayed
in
their
best
bright
ferris
taste
had
run
entirely
in
that
hat
adorned
with
cheap
flowers
and
brilliant
ribbons
both
flowers
and
ribbons
more
or
less
soiled
and
with
no
gloves
at
all
seraphina
reported
that
she
hers
and
araminta
that
she
t
find
between
those
two
states
there
is
a
distinction
though
it
may
not
appear
at
first
sight
the
trial
carriage
had
arrived
and
judge
burnham
seated
his
party
himself
wearing
a
disturbed
face
he
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
the
company
with
which
he
was
to
go
to
town
ruth
had
thought
of
this
and
had
tried
to
plan
differently
but
with
a
man
s
obtuseness
he
had
thought
of
it
and
could
not
or
would
not
understand
why
he
should
go
in
on
the
ten
o
clock
train
and
the
rest
wait
until
twelve
especially
when
his
wife
admitted
herself
to
be
in
haste
and
they
might
all
go
together
fairly
seated
opposite
his
daughters
he
saw
a
reason
for
having
gone
earlier
and
even
looked
about
him
nervously
as
the
carriage
neared
the
depot
wishing
there
was
yet
some
chance
of
escape
a
way
opened
ah
judge
this
is
fortunate
i
am
in
search
of
this
was
the
greeting
which
he
received
from
the
depot
door
and
he
left
ruth
standing
on
the
steps
and
went
forward
to
shake
hands
with
a
tall
man
in
the
prime
of
life
he
came
back
after
a
few
moments
speaking
rapidly
ruth
that
is
parsons
the
famous
criminal
lawyer
he
wants
to
consult
me
in
regard
to
a
case
and
is
going
farther
on
by
the
next
train
in
search
of
a
clue
i
guess
after
all
i
shall
have
to
wait
here
for
the
twelve
o
clock
and
have
a
talk
with
him
that
is
if
you
do
not
oh
not
at
all
ruth
said
breathing
more
freely
her
husband
s
daughters
were
less
of
a
cross
to
her
without
him
than
with
him
every
man
he
met
on
the
train
knew
and
came
to
talk
with
him
while
she
was
a
stranger
the
famous
criminal
lawyer
moved
toward
them
looking
interested
and
judge
burnham
could
hardly
escape
the
ceremony
of
introduction
ah
he
said
bowing
low
to
burnham
very
happy
to
meet
you
madam
i
have
known
your
husband
for
several
years
i
hear
you
are
just
getting
settled
at
your
terrible
task
isn
t
it
but
pays
i
suppose
when
one
gets
fairly
settled
i
didn
t
know
until
the
other
day
that
you
were
rural
in
your
tastes
judge
burnham
all
these
sentences
spoken
in
the
tone
which
indicates
that
the
person
is
talking
for
the
sake
of
filling
the
time
and
all
the
while
his
practiced
eye
was
taking
in
the
burnham
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
manner
and
somewhat
flushed
face
his
elegant
wife
who
was
a
trifle
pale
as
she
was
wont
to
be
under
strong
feeling
of
any
sort
and
the
two
girls
in
attire
standing
a
little
apart
with
wide
eyes
and
flaming
cheeks
staring
painfully
the
criminal
lawyer
seemed
to
think
that
the
position
demanded
more
words
from
him
you
are
the
victims
of
the
usual
american
nuisance
i
see
with
the
slightest
possible
inclination
of
his
head
toward
the
two
the
inefficiency
of
hired
help
is
really
the
social
puzzle
of
this
country
i
think
foreigners
have
immensely
the
advantage
of
us
just
returning
a
relay
of
the
condemned
sort
i
suppose
there
was
the
rising
inflection
to
his
sentence
which
marks
a
question
and
yet
he
rattled
on
precisely
like
a
man
who
expects
no
answer
was
it
because
the
train
sounded
its
just
then
that
judge
burnham
though
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
flashed
did
not
correct
the
criminal
lawyer
s
mistake
chapter
xxii
that
which
satisfieth
fairly
seated
in
the
train
ruth
burnham
gave
herself
up
to
gloominess
over
her
own
planning
the
episode
with
the
famous
criminal
lawyer
not
having
served
to
sweeten
her
way
she
speedily
determined
on
making
as
little
a
cross
of
the
rest
of
it
as
she
could
too
fully
realizing
that
plan
as
she
would
the
way
was
a
she
still
shrank
from
the
fashionable
madame
s
and
her
fashionable
corps
of
workers
perhaps
the
worriment
was
what
she
deserved
for
being
so
fashionable
in
her
desires
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
look
up
an
obscure
back
street
with
a
modest
sign
and
thus
help
along
the
large
army
of
workers
who
can
not
be
really
there
are
two
sides
to
even
that
question
she
understood
that
as
a
rule
the
work
done
from
that
back
street
would
be
a
continual
source
of
mortification
to
constant
strain
on
her
temper
so
long
as
the
garments
lasted
after
all
it
is
not
so
much
the
desire
to
be
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
that
sends
women
to
the
extravagantly
as
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
as
a
rule
the
ones
do
not
understand
their
business
and
will
succeed
in
making
a
bungle
of
any
work
which
they
undertake
when
there
shall
arise
a
class
of
women
who
have
carefully
learned
how
to
cut
and
make
ordinary
garments
in
the
best
manner
the
cry
of
hard
times
among
such
workers
will
be
less
frequently
heard
ruth
concluded
not
to
risk
contact
with
chance
acquaintances
in
but
directly
she
reached
the
city
took
a
carriage
to
a
store
where
she
was
a
stranger
and
did
some
rapid
transforming
work
two
stylish
wraps
selected
with
due
reference
to
their
qualifications
for
covering
much
objectionable
toilet
too
with
careful
reference
to
the
height
and
shape
and
complexion
of
the
wearers
then
gloves
that
were
strong
and
and
shapely
then
hats
of
stamp
gracefully
yet
slightly
trimmed
and
really
judge
burnham
would
hardly
have
recognized
his
daughters
ruth
surveyed
them
with
satisfaction
and
if
they
could
have
been
fitted
at
the
madame
s
without
removing
those
stylish
mantles
she
would
have
drawn
a
sigh
of
relief
as
it
was
she
still
had
that
to
dread
and
a
real
ordeal
it
was
those
who
condemn
her
for
exhibiting
much
false
pride
and
foolish
lack
of
independence
have
probably
never
been
tried
in
the
same
way
you
have
of
course
observed
that
people
s
own
peculiar
trials
are
the
ones
for
which
they
have
sympathy
they
are
harder
too
to
bear
than
any
other
person
s
ruth
was
not
one
whit
behind
the
multitude
in
her
way
of
thinking
about
herself
as
she
stood
in
the
madame
s
apartments
and
endured
the
stares
and
the
there
really
is
such
a
thing
as
what
might
be
called
set
her
teeth
hard
and
ruled
that
the
color
rush
into
her
face
and
also
that
the
madame
should
have
no
more
of
her
custom
from
this
time
forth
and
yet
when
she
came
to
cooler
moments
she
tried
to
reason
within
herself
as
to
how
the
woman
was
to
blame
what
had
she
said
or
looked
that
was
not
under
the
circumstances
most
natural
all
these
questions
ruth
held
for
the
time
being
at
bay
and
arranged
and
directed
and
criticised
with
her
usual
calm
superiority
of
manner
and
with
the
assurance
of
one
who
knew
exactly
what
she
wanted
and
intended
not
to
stop
short
of
entire
satisfaction
and
she
didn
t
she
was
more
critical
and
troublesome
even
than
usual
and
the
madame
would
have
told
you
that
that
was
unnecessary
and
at
last
after
many
delays
and
changes
of
plan
and
trimmings
and
changes
of
patterns
involving
vexatious
delays
on
madame
s
part
they
were
free
of
her
for
the
day
and
could
pursue
their
round
of
shopping
more
at
leisure
but
ruth
was
in
no
mood
for
shopping
other
than
the
necessary
things
that
must
be
ordered
to
the
madame
s
without
delay
she
was
tired
and
fretted
she
wanted
something
to
cool
and
quiet
her
she
dispatched
the
necessary
shopping
with
great
care
indeed
but
with
unusual
speed
leaving
the
girls
meantime
seated
in
the
carriage
instead
of
in
the
great
store
where
they
would
have
delighted
to
be
the
business
of
lunching
had
been
dispatched
some
time
soon
indeed
as
they
had
left
the
establishment
ruth
had
chosen
an
obscure
place
for
refreshment
not
choosing
to
risk
the
danger
of
fashionable
acquaintances
at
the
places
with
which
she
was
familiar
consequently
she
had
been
able
to
do
little
else
than
gather
her
skirts
about
her
to
protect
them
from
careless
and
hurried
waiters
and
to
curl
her
aristocratic
nose
behind
her
handkerchief
at
the
unwonted
smells
combining
around
her
while
the
girls
famished
by
the
drain
on
their
nerves
and
having
by
reason
of
the
excitement
of
the
morning
been
unable
to
indulge
in
much
breakfast
made
a
hearty
meal
not
at
all
disturbed
by
the
sights
and
sounds
and
odors
which
made
eating
an
impossibility
to
ruth
this
little
matter
served
to
add
to
her
discomfort
and
her
sense
of
gloom
for
when
people
are
hungry
they
are
much
more
ready
to
yield
to
gloom
all
the
shopping
done
that
she
could
bring
herself
to
give
attention
to
she
consulted
her
watch
and
learned
with
dismay
that
there
was
an
hour
and
a
half
before
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
she
thought
of
her
husband
s
office
but
suppose
the
criminal
lawyer
should
be
there
in
any
case
there
would
be
those
dreadful
students
to
stare
and
nudge
each
other
and
giggle
ruth
dreaded
a
giggle
more
than
she
did
a
bullet
assuredly
she
would
not
go
there
neither
was
her
city
home
to
be
thought
of
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
present
her
husband
s
daughters
to
judge
erskine
neither
did
she
intend
that
those
daughters
in
their
present
attire
or
with
their
present
attainments
should
come
in
contact
with
her
so
as
the
woman
rode
listlessly
along
on
an
car
while
the
two
girls
were
bobbing
their
heads
swiftly
from
one
window
to
another
endeavoring
to
take
in
all
the
strange
sights
she
was
engaged
in
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
with
time
a
blackboard
bulletin
before
one
of
the
public
halls
caught
her
notice
and
her
quick
eye
took
in
the
large
lettering
reading
harry
morehouse
here
at
four
o
clock
come
before
she
had
reached
the
inviting
word
she
had
signaled
the
car
and
the
bewildered
girls
were
following
her
whither
she
would
there
is
an
hour
or
more
before
we
can
go
home
she
said
in
explanation
let
us
go
to
this
meeting
perhaps
it
will
be
they
were
entirely
willing
in
fact
they
were
in
a
state
of
maze
anything
that
this
remarkable
knew
her
way
so
composedly
through
this
great
whirling
they
were
willing
to
help
carry
out
so
they
mounted
the
steps
to
the
large
light
room
where
people
were
already
thronging
in
no
acquaintances
to
be
feared
here
ruth
did
not
now
know
many
who
frequented
such
meetings
or
were
to
be
found
in
this
part
of
the
city
in
the
distance
she
caught
a
glimpse
marion
but
she
shrank
back
unwilling
to
be
recognized
even
by
her
for
marion
had
her
beautiful
daughter
beside
her
and
the
contrast
would
be
too
strikingly
painful
presently
the
meeting
opened
ruth
looked
about
her
for
harry
morehouse
a
name
with
which
she
was
not
unfamiliar
but
she
almost
curled
her
lip
in
disappointment
she
was
so
amazed
at
the
insignificance
of
this
little
boyish
man
as
if
could
help
anybody
her
heart
said
in
scorn
what
exaggerated
reports
do
get
into
the
papers
about
people
and
then
presently
she
did
just
what
many
another
person
has
done
who
has
listened
to
harry
morehouse
s
rendering
of
to
think
of
the
man
and
gave
earnest
heed
to
the
words
which
he
was
reading
words
which
someway
had
a
familiar
though
they
if
she
had
never
heard
them
before
wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
your
labor
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
hearken
diligently
unto
me
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
what
was
there
in
the
familiar
verse
that
thrilled
so
through
ruth
burnham
s
soul
that
which
satisfieth
she
needed
only
her
own
experience
to
show
her
that
one
who
understood
the
human
heart
spoke
those
words
how
freely
she
had
been
giving
labor
and
how
strangely
unsatisfying
it
all
seemed
to
her
she
fairly
hungered
and
thirsted
after
a
higher
grasp
of
the
infinite
arm
reached
down
a
great
longing
came
over
her
to
hide
herself
away
in
him
she
was
so
tired
and
so
tried
and
a
long
line
of
petty
trials
stared
her
in
the
face
she
felt
like
turning
away
from
them
all
and
yet
she
mustn
t
well
then
she
felt
like
reaching
higher
up
where
the
air
was
these
endless
details
of
dress
and
position
would
trouble
her
such
women
as
madame
the
dressmaker
would
have
no
power
to
flush
her
cheek
and
set
her
heart
to
angry
beatings
by
a
stare
suddenly
a
new
thought
flashed
across
her
heart
these
had
she
been
doing
for
them
how
had
she
been
trying
to
satisfy
them
in
the
days
that
they
had
spent
together
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
once
alluded
even
in
the
most
remote
manner
to
anything
higher
or
better
or
more
satisfying
than
these
new
things
which
at
best
were
to
perish
with
the
using
had
she
not
by
her
example
left
the
impress
of
her
first
influence
upon
them
to
the
effect
that
rooms
and
bodies
were
important
things
on
which
to
spend
one
s
strength
well
she
said
within
her
disturbed
self
i
have
no
no
time
inquired
that
other
inner
self
which
is
forever
at
war
with
its
fellow
is
it
because
you
have
been
employed
on
important
matters
this
almost
angered
ruth
it
flushed
her
face
and
she
said
there
is
a
proper
time
for
all
yes
said
the
other
one
and
is
the
proper
time
to
attend
to
this
most
important
concern
with
which
we
have
to
do
in
life
all
the
lesser
matters
are
disposed
of
then
ruth
roused
and
gave
her
heart
some
searching
into
was
it
possible
that
she
had
really
been
teaching
those
girls
that
she
considered
the
matter
of
their
outward
adorning
more
important
than
anything
else
connected
with
them
if
actions
speak
even
louder
than
words
and
if
she
had
acted
the
one
and
not
so
much
as
the
other
what
else
they
think
i
am
glad
she
told
herself
that
i
brought
them
into
this
meeting
at
least
they
will
get
a
different
idea
then
she
turned
and
looked
at
them
they
get
different
ideas
or
had
the
first
taken
root
leaving
at
least
no
room
for
other
growths
miss
seraphina
was
spreading
her
hand
carefully
out
on
her
lap
and
contemplating
with
eyes
of
unmistakable
admiration
the
color
and
texture
and
fit
of
her
new
gloves
it
was
altogether
probable
that
she
had
never
worn
gloves
before
and
she
felt
their
importance
the
other
sister
was
evidently
as
totally
absorbed
in
the
trimness
of
her
kid
boot
the
advent
of
which
had
made
her
foot
a
stranger
to
herself
with
which
she
was
trying
to
get
acquainted
as
though
harry
morehouse
and
his
wonderful
new
bible
had
been
in
london
at
that
moment
a
strange
pang
thrilled
the
heart
of
the
woman
who
was
trying
in
her
youth
to
be
a
mother
to
these
two
as
she
looked
at
their
absorbed
faces
and
followed
the
direction
of
their
eyes
was
that
simply
the
necessary
result
of
new
refinements
would
these
all
sink
into
their
proper
and
subordinate
places
directly
the
newness
and
strangeness
had
worn
off
or
was
this
really
a
wave
of
her
own
influence
which
was
going
to
increase
in
power
as
surely
as
it
was
fed
now
this
thought
did
not
rest
her
and
while
it
was
desirable
in
itself
that
she
should
be
thus
early
roused
to
the
sense
of
danger
there
might
be
in
flooding
these
young
creatures
with
this
world
s
vanities
that
wise
old
enemy
satan
was
on
the
alert
to
make
the
whole
matter
into
thorns
with
which
to
prick
ruth
s
tired
heart
and
in
obliging
her
thoughts
to
revolve
around
this
center
never
widening
it
nor
seeing
her
way
out
of
the
maze
yet
effectually
shutting
her
off
from
the
practical
help
which
awaited
her
through
the
channel
of
harry
morehouse
s
bible
somebody
has
said
that
whoever
else
stays
away
from
a
religious
meeting
satan
never
does
was
there
ever
a
truer
statement
if
he
would
only
appear
in
his
natural
character
instead
of
as
in
this
instance
transforming
himself
into
a
goad
and
pressing
hard
against
the
nerves
that
were
already
strained
to
their
utmost
on
the
whole
judge
burnham
went
home
on
the
five
o
clock
train
thoroughly
wearied
in
body
and
mind
and
with
a
haunting
sense
of
disappointment
pressing
down
her
spirits
she
had
accomplished
that
which
she
had
in
the
morning
started
to
do
she
had
been
successful
in
all
her
undertakings
and
could
feel
that
things
were
now
in
train
for
making
transformation
in
the
outward
appearance
of
these
hitherto
neglected
girls
a
laudable
undertaking
certainly
so
it
was
held
in
its
place
but
she
could
not
get
her
heart
away
from
the
sentence
and
your
labor
for
that
which
satisfieth
chapter
xxiii
wherefore
now
i
am
afraid
you
will
laugh
over
the
matter
which
appeared
next
to
ruth
burnham
in
the
shape
of
a
trial
yet
if
you
have
not
lived
long
enough
in
this
world
to
be
in
sympathy
with
the
trials
which
in
certain
states
of
mind
look
large
either
your
experience
is
not
extensive
or
your
not
large
it
was
no
greater
matter
than
the
hair
which
belonged
to
judge
burnham
s
daughters
but
really
if
you
have
seen
the
trying
way
in
which
they
managed
to
disfigure
their
heads
with
this
part
of
their
adorning
you
would
have
felt
that
some
action
was
demanded
ruth
knew
exactly
how
each
head
ought
to
be
dressed
she
could
almost
see
the
effect
that
would
be
produced
by
a
skillful
and
easily
attainable
arrangement
then
where
the
trial
why
perhaps
if
you
are
not
made
up
of
that
cruelly
sensitive
type
of
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
are
will
be
difficult
to
make
plain
to
you
how
ruth
shrank
from
touching
that
hair
human
hair
other
than
her
own
was
a
thing
which
she
desired
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
she
could
admire
it
when
well
cared
for
and
she
did
most
heartily
but
to
for
it
to
comb
and
brush
and
fondle
over
person
s
hair
was
to
ruth
or
would
have
been
had
she
ever
been
called
upon
to
suffer
in
that
line
a
positive
martyrdom
now
add
to
this
the
fact
that
this
shrinking
from
the
work
increased
tenfold
when
it
had
to
do
with
any
person
who
was
not
dear
and
precious
and
possibly
you
can
comprehend
why
she
wore
so
troubled
a
face
that
saturday
evening
and
gazed
at
those
hopeless
heads
opposite
her
and
wondered
how
a
transformation
was
to
be
brought
about
she
was
hopeless
as
regarded
teaching
the
intricacies
of
any
becoming
twist
or
curl
in
time
with
patience
and
with
often
taking
hold
and
obliging
the
refractory
hairs
to
lie
in
their
place
it
might
be
accomplished
and
here
poor
ruth
shivered
over
the
horrors
of
a
possible
future
experience
but
to
get
them
ready
to
appear
at
church
the
next
morning
without
a
personal
encounter
was
not
to
be
hoped
for
this
saturday
evening
although
the
family
had
been
three
weeks
in
their
new
home
was
the
first
in
which
they
were
planning
for
church
the
little
church
in
the
village
had
been
closed
for
a
longer
space
of
time
than
that
undergoing
repairs
and
the
first
sabbath
after
their
marriage
ruth
had
contrived
to
plan
and
work
herself
into
an
exhaustive
headache
that
had
to
be
succumbed
to
and
petted
all
day
the
next
they
had
been
forced
to
spend
in
the
city
by
reason
of
having
missed
the
last
train
out
on
saturday
now
here
they
were
on
the
eve
of
the
third
and
ruth
at
least
had
been
planning
toward
the
little
stone
church
around
the
corner
everything
was
in
readiness
the
new
dresses
and
the
new
bonnets
and
the
new
gloves
and
all
the
new
and
bewildering
paraphernalia
of
the
toilet
had
arrived
from
the
city
the
last
package
only
the
evening
before
and
but
for
that
dreadful
hair
ruth
would
have
been
happy
over
the
thought
of
the
effect
to
be
produced
by
the
next
morning
s
toilet
it
was
susan
who
at
last
and
in
an
unexpected
manner
came
to
the
rescue
just
as
she
had
stepped
in
and
rescued
ruth
from
a
hundred
trials
both
seen
and
unseen
during
the
experiences
of
the
last
three
weeks
she
did
her
part
so
naturally
too
as
one
who
simply
happened
along
at
the
right
moment
without
having
understood
any
special
need
for
it
perhaps
there
is
no
rarer
or
more
perfect
way
of
bearing
one
another
s
burdens
than
this
apparently
unconscious
one
they
sat
in
the
cheery
would
not
have
it
called
a
in
no
part
of
the
house
had
the
transformation
been
more
complete
than
in
that
square
and
room
judge
burnham
was
reading
certain
business
letters
that
seemed
to
perplex
him
the
girls
were
wishing
that
they
could
invent
some
excuse
for
escaping
early
from
the
room
to
their
own
that
they
might
have
another
look
at
all
the
beauties
of
their
wardrobe
and
ruth
was
gazing
at
them
with
a
distressed
air
and
manner
and
thinking
of
hair
susan
glancing
up
from
her
followed
the
direction
of
ruth
s
eyes
for
a
moment
then
she
spoke
her
thoughts
i
just
to
get
hold
of
your
the
remark
seemed
to
be
addressed
to
the
two
girls
and
was
so
in
keeping
with
ruth
s
thoughts
that
she
started
and
flushed
wondering
for
an
instant
whether
it
were
possible
for
susan
to
know
what
they
were
the
girls
laughed
and
looked
pleased
at
her
interest
your
hair
would
curl
beautifully
susan
added
addressing
the
elder
sister
and
those
wide
braids
in
which
heavy
hair
is
arranged
now
would
just
fit
minta
s
face
don
t
you
think
so
ruth
yes
said
ruth
promptly
i
am
sure
of
it
but
i
don
t
know
that
she
could
get
them
looped
oh
yes
she
could
it
is
very
easy
after
one
knows
how
girls
i
am
an
excellent
barber
suppose
we
go
and
try
my
skill
i
can
show
you
so
that
you
can
arrange
that
part
of
your
toilet
in
the
morning
in
less
time
than
it
usually
this
plan
was
immediately
carried
out
the
three
going
with
merry
voices
susan
s
cheery
one
being
heard
to
say
oh
you
don
t
understand
half
my
accomplishments
yet
there
are
ever
so
many
things
i
can
that
is
a
fact
said
judge
burnham
with
emphasis
she
is
a
very
treasure
in
the
house
i
used
to
pity
you
ruth
but
upon
my
word
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
i
am
not
sure
that
there
was
any
room
for
there
was
not
ruth
said
heartily
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
realize
it
but
she
has
been
from
the
first
day
of
her
coming
to
our
home
a
blessing
to
and
so
strange
are
these
hearts
of
ours
touched
oftentimes
by
words
or
deeds
apparently
so
slight
ruth
felt
the
little
episode
of
the
as
something
that
called
forth
very
tender
feeling
for
her
sister
she
began
to
have
a
dim
idea
of
what
a
blessing
might
be
hidden
in
a
simple
quiet
life
constantly
unselfish
in
things
so
it
came
to
pass
that
on
a
lovely
sabbath
morning
the
burnham
family
were
one
and
all
making
ready
to
appear
as
a
family
in
the
little
stone
church
the
girls
had
been
there
more
or
less
on
sabbaths
during
their
lives
years
ago
judge
burnham
used
to
go
occasionally
when
he
felt
like
it
but
it
had
been
many
a
year
since
he
had
been
seen
inside
the
unpretending
little
building
ruth
of
course
had
never
been
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
them
all
were
so
new
and
strange
that
it
was
almost
like
a
company
of
strangers
being
introduced
into
together
the
two
girls
came
down
a
trifle
earlier
than
the
others
and
were
in
the
hall
near
the
doorway
where
the
soft
yellow
sunlight
rested
on
them
when
judge
burnham
descended
the
stairs
down
he
paused
with
a
surprised
irresolute
air
as
his
eyes
rested
on
the
two
apparent
strangers
and
then
as
one
of
them
turned
suddenly
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
the
surprise
deepened
into
bewilderment
who
these
young
ladies
who
were
so
at
home
in
his
house
in
the
privacy
of
a
sabbath
morning
this
was
the
first
thought
and
the
second
it
is
it
be
that
they
are
my
daughters
then
it
is
almost
surprising
that
he
did
not
at
once
feel
humiliated
over
the
fact
that
outward
adornings
had
power
so
to
transform
it
was
certainly
a
transformation
rich
silks
just
the
right
tint
to
accord
well
with
skin
and
eyes
made
in
that
indescribable
manner
which
marks
the
finished
workman
to
those
eyes
skilled
in
translating
it
and
to
other
eyes
it
simply
says
the
effect
is
wraps
and
hats
and
gloves
and
in
keeping
and
in
place
of
the
hair
were
soft
smooth
rolling
auburn
curls
completely
changing
the
expression
of
the
wearer
s
face
also
that
unbecoming
mass
of
shortish
hair
which
had
hung
in
such
untidy
uncouthness
was
gone
and
in
its
place
wide
smooth
braids
tastefully
looped
here
and
there
with
knots
of
ribbon
of
just
the
right
shade
ruth
should
have
been
there
at
that
moment
to
see
the
two
and
to
see
judge
burnham
as
he
looked
at
them
she
would
have
felt
rewarded
for
her
work
it
certainly
strange
what
a
different
manner
the
hitherto
awkward
girls
now
assumed
a
sense
of
conscious
becomingness
if
it
were
nothing
more
had
fallen
upon
them
and
in
the
effort
to
do
justice
to
their
new
selves
they
almost
unconsciously
drew
the
stooping
shoulders
straight
and
stood
with
heads
erect
well
upon
my
word
said
judge
burnham
recovering
himself
at
last
and
advancing
toward
them
i
didn
t
know
you
i
wondered
what
strange
ladies
we
had
here
your
fall
suits
are
certainly
very
he
chose
to
ignore
the
fact
that
fall
suits
were
new
experiences
to
them
perhaps
he
really
did
not
yet
understand
to
what
a
new
world
they
had
been
introduced
the
two
laughed
not
unpleasantly
and
the
flush
on
their
cheeks
toned
as
it
was
by
the
billows
of
soft
ruchings
about
the
throat
was
certainly
not
unbecoming
they
had
taken
long
looks
at
themselves
in
their
mirror
that
morning
and
it
was
not
unpleasant
to
them
to
think
that
their
father
did
not
recognize
them
they
had
already
reached
the
place
where
they
had
no
desire
to
have
their
past
recognized
some
seed
takes
root
promptly
and
grows
rapidly
you
may
imagine
that
the
entrance
of
the
burnham
party
to
the
little
stone
church
was
an
event
in
the
eyes
of
the
congregation
they
had
known
the
burnham
girls
all
their
lives
but
these
young
ladies
they
never
saw
before
it
would
have
been
curious
to
a
student
of
human
nature
to
have
studied
the
effect
which
their
changed
appearance
made
on
the
different
characters
present
certain
ones
looked
unaffected
and
unconcealed
amazement
others
gazed
up
at
them
and
returned
their
nods
of
recognition
with
respectful
bows
seeming
to
look
upon
them
as
people
who
had
moved
to
an
immense
distance
from
themselves
and
there
were
those
who
resented
the
removal
and
tossed
their
heads
and
said
with
their
eyes
and
the
shape
of
their
mouths
that
they
considered
themselves
quite
as
good
as
those
burnham
girls
if
they
were
all
decked
out
like
peacocks
as
for
judge
burnham
the
shade
of
satisfied
pride
in
place
of
the
mortification
which
he
had
schooled
himself
to
feel
repaid
his
wife
for
her
three
weeks
of
effort
then
she
tried
to
turn
away
from
the
question
of
personal
appearance
and
give
herself
to
the
service
but
she
was
both
surprised
and
pained
to
find
that
in
her
efforts
to
place
these
girls
in
their
proper
position
before
others
she
had
someway
lost
ground
spiritually
it
was
all
very
well
to
resolve
to
turn
her
thoughts
away
from
the
girls
and
their
dresses
and
their
bonnets
and
their
hair
and
their
manners
but
it
was
another
thing
to
accomplish
it
she
found
what
possibly
we
have
each
discovered
by
experience
that
it
was
not
easy
to
get
away
on
sabbath
in
church
from
that
which
had
absorbed
us
during
the
week
and
indeed
a
fair
share
of
the
early
sabbath
itself
try
as
she
would
to
join
in
hymn
or
or
even
prayers
she
found
her
mind
wandering
to
such
trivial
questions
as
whether
after
all
a
shade
lighter
of
the
silk
would
have
fitted
minta
s
peculiar
complexion
better
or
whether
those
gloves
were
not
a
trifle
large
these
thoughts
were
very
hateful
to
her
she
struggled
hard
to
get
away
from
them
and
was
amazed
and
distressed
beyond
measure
to
find
that
they
held
her
captive
she
waited
eagerly
for
the
sermon
hoping
that
it
would
be
such
an
one
as
would
hold
her
attention
for
her
since
she
was
not
able
to
control
it
herself
and
behold
the
text
announced
was
one
which
indeed
helped
her
wandering
thoughts
but
threw
her
back
into
the
very
midst
of
the
gloom
which
had
pressed
her
heart
the
last
time
she
heard
those
words
wherefore
do
ye
spend
money
for
that
which
is
not
bread
and
your
labor
for
that
which
satisfieth
not
again
her
answering
conscience
said
that
was
what
she
had
been
doing
money
and
time
and
strength
freely
given
for
that
which
was
not
bread
it
had
not
fed
her
soul
on
the
contrary
it
or
something
else
had
starved
her
well
what
was
the
trouble
she
had
surely
done
that
which
was
her
duty
yes
but
did
a
revealing
spirit
whisper
the
words
in
her
ear
just
then
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
have
left
the
other
she
had
been
in
her
labor
she
had
put
these
things
first
she
had
risen
and
gone
about
the
day
too
hurried
for
other
than
a
word
of
hurried
for
any
private
reading
she
had
retired
at
night
too
wearied
in
mind
and
body
for
any
prayer
at
all
she
was
starved
much
time
gone
and
no
bread
for
her
hungry
soul
also
having
not
fed
herself
how
could
she
have
been
expected
to
feed
others
even
yet
she
had
said
almost
nothing
to
these
daughters
of
hers
about
the
matter
she
had
talked
with
them
often
and
long
all
the
details
of
the
toilet
had
been
gone
over
carefully
exhaustively
and
she
and
they
and
judge
burnham
himself
were
satisfied
with
the
results
of
her
words
in
that
direction
what
about
the
direction
which
how
was
ruth
to
get
away
from
her
heart
no
i
must
do
her
justice
that
was
not
her
cry
she
did
not
want
to
get
away
from
the
awakening
voice
she
was
distressed
she
was
humiliated
she
was
unhappy
but
she
wanted
to
find
rest
only
through
the
love
and
patience
of
jesus
she
felt
like
a
sheep
who
had
wandered
outside
even
while
doing
work
that
she
surely
thought
was
set
for
indeed
it
was
but
her
eyes
were
just
opening
to
the
fact
that
one
can
do
work
that
the
master
has
set
so
vigorously
as
to
forget
the
which
he
has
marked
for
the
soul
to
pause
and
commune
with
him
and
gather
strength
she
had
been
but
not
and
then
again
it
was
most
painfully
true
that
because
of
her
lack
of
spiritual
strength
she
had
done
but
half
her
work
the
important
human
side
she
had
held
to
its
important
place
and
worked
faithfully
for
it
but
the
important
spiritual
side
she
had
allowed
to
sink
almost
out
of
sight
of
her
vision
and
even
when
roused
by
his
spirit
as
he
had
spoken
to
her
through
that
very
verse
but
a
little
time
before
she
had
allowed
her
roused
heart
to
slip
back
and
absorb
itself
in
the
cares
of
this
world
and
the
adornments
of
fleshly
bodies
while
the
souls
waited
truth
to
tell
ruth
was
not
troubled
any
more
that
morning
by
wandering
thoughts
neither
did
she
hear
much
of
the
earnest
sermon
which
was
preached
but
if
the
preacher
had
but
known
how
the
holy
spirit
took
his
text
and
preached
to
one
soul
for
him
he
would
have
gone
home
to
his
closet
on
his
knees
and
thanked
god
for
using
his
lips
that
day
in
reading
to
that
soul
that
questioning
word
chapter
xxiv
hearken
unto
it
passes
my
comprehension
how
a
man
with
no
more
development
of
than
that
one
possesses
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
he
was
called
to
preach
this
was
what
judge
burnham
said
as
he
walked
with
his
wife
home
from
the
morning
service
did
you
ever
hear
an
effort
more
devoid
of
ideas
what
possible
good
can
he
think
he
has
accomplished
if
that
is
his
motive
or
how
can
he
have
sufficient
vanity
to
imagine
that
it
is
other
than
a
bore
to
listen
to
him
ruth
hesitated
for
her
answer
it
was
not
that
she
had
been
so
impressed
with
the
sermon
it
was
rather
the
text
that
had
been
preached
to
her
and
she
did
not
feel
personally
sensitive
in
regard
to
judge
burnham
s
opinion
of
this
particular
minister
i
think
the
reason
that
the
words
struck
sharply
on
her
heart
was
because
they
revealed
her
husband
s
utter
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
sermon
he
was
speaking
solely
from
a
critical
intellectual
standpoint
without
apparently
a
conception
of
any
spiritual
power
connected
with
the
foolishness
of
the
sentence
revealed
to
ruth
as
with
a
flash
of
as
reveals
fact
that
her
husband
had
no
sympathy
with
christ
or
his
servants
as
such
of
course
she
had
known
this
before
but
to
know
a
thing
and
to
it
are
two
very
different
matters
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
of
the
truth
she
said
after
a
little
speaking
hesitatingly
it
impressed
me
however
a
thing
does
not
need
to
be
new
in
order
to
be
helpful
it
may
be
as
old
as
the
earth
and
we
never
have
given
it
possibly
he
said
lightly
there
are
things
so
old
and
so
tiresome
that
we
do
not
care
to
give
them
special
attention
i
am
entirely
willing
to
class
that
sermon
among
such
if
you
say
so
i
declare
i
had
not
realized
that
a
sermon
could
be
such
a
trial
to
me
i
don
t
quite
see
what
is
to
be
done
i
suppose
your
orthodoxy
will
not
permit
of
your
staying
at
home
on
sabbath
and
i
m
sure
we
can
not
tolerate
that
sort
of
suppose
he
calls
it
preaching
how
shall
we
manage
still
ruth
had
no
answer
ready
every
word
that
he
spoke
served
to
increase
the
heavy
weight
at
her
heart
and
despite
her
shivering
effort
to
get
away
from
it
there
rang
the
question
how
can
two
walk
together
except
they
be
agreed
yet
she
realized
only
too
well
that
the
time
for
settling
that
question
was
long
past
that
she
had
taken
solemn
and
irrevocable
vows
upon
her
and
must
abide
by
them
the
question
now
was
how
was
she
so
to
walk
with
him
as
not
to
dishonor
christ
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
man
s
preaching
she
said
coldly
and
her
husband
laughed
and
told
her
he
appreciated
her
efforts
to
make
the
best
of
everything
but
unfortunately
she
had
too
much
brain
to
allow
him
for
a
moment
to
believe
that
such
weak
attempts
at
oratory
satisfied
her
then
he
changed
the
subject
talking
of
matters
as
foreign
to
ruth
s
thoughts
as
possible
and
yet
serving
by
their
very
distance
from
her
heart
to
press
the
weight
of
pain
deeper
her
eyes
once
widely
opened
it
seemed
that
everything
which
occurred
that
day
served
to
show
her
more
plainly
the
gulf
which
lay
between
her
ideas
and
plans
and
hopes
and
those
of
her
husband
what
a
glorious
day
this
is
he
had
said
as
they
turned
from
the
dinner
table
i
declare
i
believe
the
country
ahead
of
the
city
on
such
days
as
these
any
way
ruth
what
do
you
say
to
a
ride
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
explore
that
winding
road
which
seemed
to
stretch
away
into
while
he
waited
he
watched
with
surprise
the
flush
which
deepened
and
spread
on
his
wife
s
face
it
so
happened
that
the
question
of
sabbath
riding
for
pleasure
was
one
which
had
come
up
incidentally
for
discussion
one
evening
at
flossy
shipley
s
during
roberts
visit
and
ruth
who
had
taken
the
popular
view
of
innocent
sabbath
recreation
had
discussed
the
matter
with
keen
relish
finding
roberts
able
to
meet
her
at
every
point
she
had
been
first
annoyed
to
find
her
position
open
to
so
much
objection
then
interested
to
study
the
question
in
all
its
bearings
and
ended
as
such
a
frank
intelligent
and
thoroughly
sincere
nature
as
hersmust
end
in
abandoning
a
position
which
she
saw
was
untenable
and
coming
strongly
over
to
the
other
side
since
which
time
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
had
been
one
of
her
strong
points
judge
burnham
had
respected
her
scruples
so
far
as
he
knew
them
but
truth
to
tell
he
did
not
understand
them
very
well
having
no
personal
principle
in
the
matter
by
which
to
judge
he
was
in
danger
of
erring
in
unthought
of
directions
and
every
new
phase
of
the
same
question
demanded
a
new
line
of
reasoning
it
had
not
so
much
as
occurred
to
him
that
his
wife
would
see
any
impropriety
in
riding
out
in
her
own
carriage
on
the
sabbath
day
with
her
husband
on
a
quiet
unfrequented
country
road
while
she
hesitated
he
watched
her
curiously
well
he
said
laughing
at
last
what
is
the
trouble
you
look
as
though
i
had
broken
all
the
commands
in
the
decalogue
am
i
on
forbidden
ground
now
not
the
commands
ruth
said
trying
to
smile
but
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
the
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
it
i
am
not
thoroughly
posted
as
to
the
position
in
which
they
stand
at
least
what
is
wrong
ruth
judge
burnham
i
don
t
like
to
ride
out
for
pleasure
on
what
not
with
me
is
it
wicked
to
have
a
pleasant
time
on
sabbath
i
didn
t
know
that
i
fail
to
see
why
we
can
t
be
as
good
sitting
together
in
the
carriage
as
we
are
sitting
together
in
the
parlor
or
should
we
spend
this
day
apart
enjoying
the
luxury
of
melancholy
reflection
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
you
are
much
too
well
versed
in
argument
to
be
entirely
ignorant
of
people
s
views
in
regard
to
this
upon
my
word
ruth
i
was
never
more
innocent
i
might
be
able
to
see
some
force
in
a
young
lady
s
objection
to
riding
out
with
a
young
gentleman
especially
in
a
city
or
in
a
crowded
thoroughfare
though
even
such
things
may
be
carried
to
excess
but
when
it
comes
to
one
s
husband
and
a
country
road
where
we
shall
not
meet
three
people
in
an
hour
i
confess
i
am
befogged
susan
do
you
see
the
bearings
of
this
case
why
i
see
a
good
many
bearings
which
you
would
not
admit
and
possibly
you
could
bring
to
bear
a
good
many
arguments
which
would
not
admit
we
start
from
different
standpoints
it
all
resolves
itself
into
whether
we
believe
the
word
of
god
or
not
and
i
accept
it
as
our
rule
of
why
no
it
doesn
t
i
believe
the
word
of
god
in
a
measure
at
least
i
have
respect
for
the
sabbath
as
an
institution
and
believe
in
its
sacredness
i
have
no
sort
of
fault
to
find
with
remember
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
i
believe
it
was
a
good
sensible
law
but
we
should
very
likely
quarrel
over
the
word
i
should
object
to
the
narrowness
which
made
it
so
falsely
holy
that
i
could
not
enjoy
a
ride
with
my
wife
after
church
and
i
should
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
you
could
prove
your
side
of
the
question
from
the
listen
to
one
bible
argument
then
susan
said
quietly
and
tell
me
what
you
think
it
means
if
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight
the
holy
of
the
lord
honorable
and
shalt
honor
him
not
doing
thine
own
ways
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure
nor
speaking
thine
own
what
do
you
think
of
that
argument
for
my
side
judge
burnham
the
gentleman
addressed
looked
his
embarrassment
and
annoyance
the
verse
quoted
sounded
strangely
new
and
solemn
to
him
his
inner
consciousness
was
made
certain
that
he
was
not
ready
to
gauge
his
sabbath
employments
by
that
rule
oh
well
he
said
restlessly
that
verse
would
have
to
affect
other
things
besides
riding
out
in
the
country
it
has
to
do
with
and
words
and
acts
as
it
certainly
has
susan
answered
and
she
spoke
as
if
she
thought
it
in
no
degree
lessened
the
force
of
the
argument
because
the
obligation
reached
in
many
directions
i
suppose
ruth
said
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
sabbath
is
very
poorly
observed
still
that
is
hardly
an
argument
for
increasing
the
ways
for
dishonoring
it
is
it
then
judge
burnham
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
off
to
the
piazza
deigning
no
reply
to
the
general
question
that
his
wife
had
put
as
for
herself
she
struggled
with
the
sense
of
pain
that
kept
increasing
and
wondered
how
she
should
shape
her
life
apparently
judge
burnham
became
ashamed
of
his
rudeness
for
he
returned
presently
to
the
parlor
whither
ruth
had
gone
to
wait
for
him
and
seating
himself
near
her
with
some
pleasant
remark
as
far
removed
from
the
recent
subject
as
he
could
make
it
took
up
a
book
and
seemed
to
lose
himself
in
it
ruth
followed
his
example
the
book
she
took
being
the
elegantly
bound
bible
that
her
father
had
sent
to
grace
the
table
instinctively
she
turned
to
the
chapter
from
which
the
haunting
verse
came
and
slowly
carefully
read
it
over
presently
what
had
been
a
pretense
with
judge
burnham
became
reality
he
was
interested
in
his
book
which
interest
he
evidenced
by
a
burst
of
laughter
this
is
really
rich
he
said
listen
to
this
sarcasm
ruth
see
if
you
ever
heard
anything
touch
and
then
he
read
from
the
sparkling
satirical
popular
writer
a
dozen
sentences
of
brilliant
sarcasm
concerning
one
of
the
scientific
questions
of
the
sharp
sparkling
with
wit
and
strength
but
having
to
do
with
a
subject
for
which
ruth
had
no
sympathy
at
any
time
and
which
especially
jarred
upon
her
this
sabbath
afternoon
her
husband
looked
up
from
his
reading
to
meet
the
answering
flash
of
the
eyes
which
he
liked
so
well
to
see
kindle
and
met
the
objection
on
her
face
and
felt
the
lack
of
sympathy
with
his
enjoyment
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
abruptly
i
had
forgotten
your
puritan
ideas
possibly
i
am
infringing
again
on
the
sacredness
of
your
i
certainly
think
that
the
sentiments
of
that
book
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
bible
idea
of
the
sacredness
of
the
if
ruth
could
only
have
kept
her
voice
from
sounding
as
cold
as
an
iceberg
she
might
have
had
some
influence
as
it
was
he
arose
with
a
decided
frown
on
his
fine
face
i
see
ruth
he
said
speaking
as
coldly
as
she
had
herself
that
we
assuredly
have
nothing
in
common
for
this
day
of
the
week
whatever
may
be
said
of
us
on
other
days
it
is
a
pity
that
the
sacredness
of
the
sabbath
should
be
the
only
element
of
discord
between
husband
and
wife
as
i
am
in
continual
danger
of
erring
unconsciously
i
will
have
the
grace
to
leave
you
in
solitude
and
religious
enjoyment
and
with
a
courtly
bow
he
left
her
to
herself
and
her
large
open
bible
and
her
sad
heart
a
little
later
susan
came
in
and
stopping
beside
her
looked
down
the
page
of
the
bible
ruth
laid
her
finger
on
the
words
of
the
morning
text
it
is
all
true
susan
she
said
gravely
i
don
t
believe
there
is
any
person
living
who
realizes
it
more
fully
than
i
do
that
which
satisfieth
one
may
do
one
s
best
and
succeed
in
accomplishing
and
it
is
have
you
answered
the
question
ruth
dear
whose
question
the
holy
spirit
do
ye
that
is
what
he
asks
do
you
understand
why
we
try
to
satisfy
our
souls
on
husks
instead
of
wheat
well
ruth
said
thoughtfully
things
have
to
be
of
course
but
why
should
we
stop
among
the
expecting
satisfaction
or
allow
them
to
take
other
than
the
subordinate
place
they
were
meant
to
occupy
ruth
i
think
the
trouble
with
you
is
you
do
not
read
the
whole
verse
you
feel
that
you
have
proved
the
truth
of
the
first
part
of
it
in
your
own
experience
why
don
t
you
try
the
rest
just
what
do
you
mean
why
listen
hearken
unto
me
and
eat
ye
that
which
is
good
and
let
your
soul
delight
itself
in
don
t
you
see
what
an
assurance
that
is
that
the
feast
is
spread
there
is
prepared
that
which
will
satisfy
why
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
the
master
of
the
feast
ruth
lifted
to
her
sister
s
face
earnest
eyes
that
filled
with
tears
i
tried
to
hearken
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
husky
with
feeling
i
have
heard
his
voice
and
have
tried
to
follow
him
and
at
times
as
i
have
told
you
before
he
has
seemed
very
near
but
the
feeling
does
not
stay
i
am
up
on
the
mount
one
day
more
than
satisfied
and
the
next
day
i
have
dropped
down
and
lost
my
yes
i
know
that
story
in
all
its
details
i
have
lived
it
in
my
own
case
it
was
because
i
ceased
hearkening
for
his
voice
i
placed
other
things
first
i
thought
first
of
what
was
going
to
do
or
have
or
be
instead
of
putting
christ
ruth
don
t
you
know
he
says
for
i
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
how
often
i
have
thought
of
that
he
not
with
a
divided
heart
he
must
be
and
for
myself
i
did
not
for
years
keep
him
first
god
was
not
in
my
i
don
t
know
ruth
said
speaking
slowly
after
a
long
silence
and
she
spoke
with
a
long
drawn
sigh
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
ever
get
back
to
where
i
was
even
three
weeks
ago
something
has
dropped
like
a
pall
upon
my
joy
in
religion
i
never
had
much
joy
in
anything
really
it
isn
t
my
nature
to
be
joyful
perhaps
i
should
not
expect
susan
smiling
shook
her
head
that
won
t
do
you
know
joy
is
one
of
the
fruits
that
you
are
commanded
to
bear
it
is
not
optional
with
you
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
love
remember
it
is
not
the
joy
of
nature
that
you
and
i
are
to
look
for
but
the
joy
of
grace
ruth
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
try
to
go
back
to
three
weeks
ago
i
would
try
to
go
back
to
christ
and
ask
him
to
hold
you
and
lead
you
and
speak
for
you
and
in
this
your
time
of
special
need
not
to
let
you
drop
for
one
moment
away
from
but
who
shall
account
for
the
perversity
of
the
human
heart
something
in
the
simple
earnest
words
were
translated
by
satan
to
mean
to
ruth
a
reflection
against
her
husband
she
lifted
her
head
haughtily
and
the
tremor
went
out
of
her
voice
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
my
time
of
special
need
i
do
not
know
that
one
s
life
humanly
speaking
could
be
more
carefully
shielded
than
mine
i
have
no
anxiety
as
to
judge
burnham
s
position
in
regard
to
these
questions
he
will
respect
my
wishes
and
follow
my
to
this
susan
had
no
answer
had
she
spoken
at
all
she
feared
she
would
have
shown
ruth
that
her
own
words
were
not
strictly
true
she
believed
her
at
this
moment
to
be
weighed
down
with
a
sense
of
her
husband
s
influence
over
her
when
the
bell
tolled
for
evening
service
susan
and
the
two
daughters
of
the
house
came
down
attired
for
church
going
again
queried
judge
burnham
with
uplifted
eyebrows
ruth
and
i
have
had
enough
for
and
ruth
sitting
back
in
the
easy
chair
with
a
footstool
at
her
feet
and
a
sofa
pillow
at
her
head
and
a
volume
of
sacred
poems
in
her
hand
neither
raised
her
eyes
nor
spoke
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
this
sentence
stayed
persistently
with
susan
erskine
what
had
it
to
do
with
judge
burnham
and
his
wife
that
they
too
should
remind
her
of
it
chapter
xxv
a
question
which
began
to
press
heavily
on
ruth
s
mind
as
the
days
went
by
was
what
should
she
do
when
susan
went
home
it
began
to
be
apparent
that
all
the
details
connected
with
the
reconstructed
house
were
completed
and
also
that
a
skillful
set
of
hired
helpers
were
in
their
places
but
it
was
equally
apparent
to
her
heart
that
she
shrank
from
the
thought
of
seeing
susan
pack
her
trunk
and
go
back
to
the
erskine
homestead
she
fitted
so
perfectly
into
the
family
life
she
had
already
acquired
such
a
remarkable
degree
of
influence
over
the
girls
they
copied
her
ways
and
her
words
and
it
had
some
time
ago
become
apparent
to
ruth
that
this
sister
of
hers
was
in
every
respect
worthy
of
being
copied
even
her
its
hints
from
flossy
shipley
s
words
about
which
ruth
knew
taken
such
quietness
of
tone
that
if
it
was
not
marked
for
its
beauty
had
perhaps
higher
praise
in
that
it
was
not
noticed
at
all
but
had
sunken
into
the
minor
place
it
was
expected
to
fill
ruth
in
thinking
the
past
all
over
was
amazed
at
the
wholesale
way
in
which
she
had
finally
adopted
her
sister
just
she
began
to
like
her
so
well
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
her
company
and
a
trial
to
think
of
her
absence
she
did
not
know
it
seemed
to
her
now
as
though
she
had
always
felt
so
and
yet
she
knew
that
somewhere
along
the
line
of
her
life
there
must
have
been
a
decided
change
of
feeling
she
is
just
splendid
anyway
this
was
the
final
verdict
i
don
t
care
when
i
began
to
know
it
i
know
it
now
i
wish
i
could
have
her
with
me
always
if
she
and
father
could
live
out
here
with
us
how
nice
it
would
be
father
would
like
the
country
it
would
rest
and
strengthen
him
but
oh
woman
which
two
words
spoken
with
an
intensity
of
emphasis
that
she
allowed
only
the
four
walls
of
her
room
to
hear
always
referred
to
judge
erskine
she
was
quite
as
much
of
a
trial
as
ever
ruth
could
not
conceive
of
a
possibility
of
there
ever
being
a
time
when
she
should
want
to
see
so
she
studied
over
the
problem
of
how
to
keep
susan
and
like
many
another
student
found
after
a
few
days
that
it
was
worked
out
for
her
in
a
way
that
she
would
not
have
chosen
the
news
burst
like
a
into
their
midst
without
note
or
warning
judge
erskine
had
lost
his
fortune
large
though
it
had
been
it
slipped
out
of
his
grasp
almost
in
an
hour
the
trouble
has
to
do
with
and
religion
judge
burnham
said
with
something
very
like
a
sneer
on
his
handsome
face
i
don
t
know
which
development
should
be
blamed
the
most
during
his
exile
from
the
office
his
clerks
made
some
very
foolish
moves
as
regarded
investments
etc
and
then
the
other
disease
reached
such
a
form
that
he
was
beguiled
into
putting
his
name
to
two
or
three
pieces
of
paper
for
others
on
the
score
of
piece
of
idiocy
that
during
all
his
sane
years
he
had
warned
me
and
every
other
business
man
who
came
to
him
for
advice
from
being
beguiled
into
and
the
result
is
financial
there
are
worse
ruins
than
that
ruth
said
it
haughtily
her
husband
s
criticism
of
her
father
jarred
oh
that
is
true
enough
there
are
dishonorable
ruins
this
one
is
the
soul
of
honor
and
of
philanthropy
for
that
matter
he
has
much
to
sustain
him
but
he
can
t
live
on
it
and
ruth
if
you
had
ever
known
what
it
was
to
live
on
nothing
you
could
sympathize
better
with
that
sort
of
ruin
the
hard
part
for
me
to
bear
would
be
that
it
is
all
so
unnecessary
if
he
had
but
lived
up
to
the
wisdom
and
business
keenness
which
characterized
all
the
earlier
years
of
his
life
he
has
taken
to
giving
some
very
strange
advice
to
his
clients
since
he
subscribed
to
his
new
which
has
taken
thousands
of
dollars
out
of
his
business
had
to
do
it
he
told
me
his
conscience
wouldn
t
allow
him
to
do
if
that
is
true
i
am
really
afraid
that
i
couldn
t
afford
to
have
a
conscience
it
is
too
expensive
in
how
much
of
this
was
sincere
and
how
much
was
a
sort
of
sarcastic
pleasantry
ruth
wished
she
knew
it
was
a
new
and
rather
startling
thought
that
possibly
the
money
which
sustained
her
now
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
her
husband
couldn
t
afford
a
sensitive
conscience
she
put
the
thought
away
as
far
from
her
as
possible
at
least
she
could
do
nothing
with
it
now
the
time
for
it
was
past
she
tried
not
to
think
what
ground
she
had
for
expecting
a
high
type
of
conscience
from
one
who
lived
in
cool
dishonor
of
the
claims
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
immediate
questions
were
what
would
her
father
do
also
what
was
there
that
she
could
do
for
him
oh
he
will
give
everything
up
judge
burnham
said
every
penny
house
and
landed
property
and
household
goods
down
to
his
very
dog
even
his
clothing
is
in
danger
i
saw
it
in
his
eyes
it
is
the
disease
which
has
pervaded
his
system
this
new
conscience
of
his
won
t
let
him
do
anything
judge
burnham
said
ruth
having
endured
all
that
she
was
not
skilled
in
i
wish
you
would
remember
that
you
are
speaking
of
my
father
and
refrain
from
sneers
if
his
code
of
honor
is
higher
than
yours
he
can
not
help
it
i
suppose
at
least
you
should
be
able
to
respect
it
or
failing
in
that
please
respect
my
i
beg
your
pardon
said
judge
burnham
quickly
startled
by
the
repressed
fierceness
of
the
tones
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
ruth
but
you
do
not
understand
business
and
your
father
is
really
being
very
absurd
with
his
strained
ideas
of
i
understand
conscience
somewhat
ruth
said
quickly
and
she
was
stung
with
the
thought
that
perhaps
in
the
days
gone
by
she
had
stifled
hers
now
all
this
was
certainly
very
sad
talk
to
come
between
husband
and
wife
not
six
weeks
after
their
marriage
ruth
felt
it
and
deplored
it
and
wept
over
it
and
wondered
how
it
would
be
possible
to
avoid
subjects
on
which
they
did
not
think
and
feel
alike
meantime
she
ought
to
go
and
see
her
father
from
this
she
shrank
how
could
she
talk
with
him
from
any
other
standpoint
than
that
in
which
she
had
always
known
him
a
man
of
wealth
and
power
in
the
business
world
she
felt
that
he
must
be
utterly
bowed
down
he
had
always
in
a
lofty
aristocratic
way
attached
full
importance
to
wealth
how
was
he
going
to
endure
being
suddenly
thrown
to
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
when
he
had
for
so
many
years
rested
securely
on
the
top
round
however
it
was
folly
for
her
to
avoid
such
an
evident
duty
she
chose
an
hour
when
erskine
would
be
undoubtedly
engaged
and
slipped
away
to
the
train
having
said
nothing
of
her
intention
to
her
husband
when
he
went
to
town
an
hour
before
and
without
having
as
yet
succeeded
in
arranging
a
single
sentence
that
she
felt
would
be
helpful
to
her
father
she
suddenly
and
silently
presented
herself
before
him
in
the
little
room
off
the
library
which
was
sacred
to
his
private
use
he
sat
at
the
table
writing
his
face
pale
indeed
but
quiet
not
exactly
cheerful
yet
certainly
peaceful
he
glanced
up
as
the
door
opened
and
then
arose
quickly
well
daughter
he
said
you
have
come
to
see
father
in
his
trouble
that
is
right
come
in
dear
and
have
a
and
with
the
courtesy
he
drew
an
easy
chair
for
her
and
waited
while
she
seated
herself
then
he
sat
down
again
in
his
large
before
her
yes
he
said
i
must
begin
again
i
shall
not
get
to
where
i
was
before
on
your
account
i
regret
it
i
wanted
to
leave
you
a
fortune
to
do
good
with
but
your
husband
has
enough
and
it
is
all
right
the
lord
can
choose
what
money
he
will
have
spent
for
you
certainly
need
not
think
of
me
father
as
you
say
judge
burnham
has
and
even
at
this
moment
there
was
a
pang
in
ruth
s
heart
that
she
would
not
have
had
her
father
see
for
worlds
as
she
wondered
how
much
power
she
could
have
over
wealth
to
turn
it
into
sources
for
good
my
chief
anxiety
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
well
he
said
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
a
smile
on
his
face
i
am
going
to
climb
up
again
with
my
wife
s
help
it
isn
t
poverty
you
know
thanks
to
her
isn
t
it
marvelous
how
she
can
have
saved
so
much
out
of
the
paltry
yearly
sums
haven
t
you
heard
about
it
why
she
actually
has
at
interest
about
fourteen
thousand
dollars
invested
in
my
name
too
isn
t
that
a
reward
for
the
indignities
i
heaped
upon
her
his
voice
broke
and
the
tears
started
in
his
eyes
i
tell
you
he
said
tremulously
i
bore
it
all
better
than
that
i
knew
i
was
not
to
blame
for
the
financial
downfall
but
to
find
that
the
woman
whom
i
had
wronged
had
been
all
these
years
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
just
unmanned
me
and
he
wiped
the
great
tears
from
his
cheeks
while
ruth
moved
restlessly
in
her
seat
she
did
not
like
to
hear
about
his
having
wronged
that
woman
neither
did
she
like
to
have
her
father
beholden
to
for
support
it
is
fortunate
that
she
saved
it
she
said
and
her
voice
was
most
unsympathetic
but
after
all
father
it
is
your
no
daughter
no
not
a
penny
of
it
ten
times
that
sum
ought
to
belong
to
her
think
of
trying
to
make
repair
the
injury
which
i
was
doing
her
but
it
is
most
comforting
to
feel
that
i
am
to
be
beholden
to
her
rather
than
to
any
other
human
ruth
did
not
think
so
i
have
been
wonderfully
sustained
ruth
her
father
continued
i
said
last
night
that
it
was
almost
worth
losing
a
fortune
to
see
how
calmly
the
lord
jesus
could
hold
me
i
haven
t
had
a
doubt
nor
an
anxiety
as
to
its
being
the
right
way
from
the
first
hour
that
i
knew
of
the
loss
of
course
i
don
t
see
it
should
come
and
really
i
don
t
believe
i
care
to
know
why
should
i
when
i
can
so
entirely
trust
to
his
wisdom
and
love
there
is
another
thing
sweet
came
with
the
bitter
and
was
so
much
more
important
that
it
did
you
know
that
your
mother
had
come
into
the
sunlight
of
his
love
she
told
me
about
it
that
very
evening
and
she
says
she
owes
her
knowledge
of
the
way
to
me
isn
t
that
a
wonderful
boon
for
the
lord
to
bestow
on
such
as
i
ruth
turned
almost
away
from
him
with
an
unaccountable
irritability
tugging
at
her
heart
your
mother
he
had
never
used
those
words
to
her
before
they
had
slipped
out
now
unconsciously
he
had
grown
used
to
their
sound
in
speaking
to
susan
he
did
not
see
how
they
jarred
it
frightened
his
daughter
to
realize
how
little
she
seemed
to
care
whether
a
soul
had
been
or
not
she
could
not
take
in
its
importance
i
am
sure
i
am
very
glad
she
said
but
her
voice
bore
not
the
slightest
trace
of
gladness
then
she
went
home
feeling
that
her
spirit
was
not
in
accord
with
the
tone
of
that
house
he
doesn
t
need
comfort
she
told
herself
and
she
said
it
almost
bitterly
it
was
true
enough
he
didn
t
not
that
he
did
not
appreciate
human
sympathy
and
human
love
but
a
greater
than
human
strength
had
laid
hold
upon
his
weakness
and
he
was
upborne
this
too
ruth
recognized
and
even
while
she
rejoiced
in
it
there
mingled
with
the
joy
a
strange
pain
following
the
money
downfall
came
plans
that
were
quite
in
accord
with
her
wishes
they
sprang
into
being
apparently
through
a
chance
remark
it
began
with
ruth
in
a
heavy
sigh
as
she
said
she
and
susan
being
alone
i
don
t
know
how
to
take
the
next
step
for
those
girls
it
is
absurd
to
think
of
sending
them
to
school
at
their
age
and
with
their
limited
knowledge
they
would
be
simply
objects
of
ridicule
we
must
find
a
resident
governess
for
them
but
where
to
look
for
one
who
will
have
to
teach
young
ladies
what
in
these
days
quite
little
children
are
supposed
to
know
and
yet
remember
that
they
are
young
ladies
and
treat
them
as
such
is
a
puzzle
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
where
to
look
nor
how
to
describe
what
we
need
the
circumstances
are
so
then
she
waited
for
susan
to
answer
and
so
accustomed
had
she
grown
to
being
helped
by
that
young
lady
s
suggestions
that
she
waited
hopefully
though
without
having
the
least
conception
of
how
a
comparative
stranger
in
the
city
could
help
in
this
emergency
there
are
plenty
to
get
susan
said
at
least
i
suppose
the
world
is
full
of
teachers
if
you
only
knew
just
where
to
look
for
oh
yes
there
are
plenty
of
them
if
a
teacher
was
all
that
was
needed
but
you
know
susan
the
case
is
a
very
unusual
one
we
really
need
a
woman
who
knows
a
good
deal
about
every
thing
and
who
is
as
wise
as
a
serpent
there
is
a
chance
to
ruin
the
girls
and
make
trouble
for
judge
burnham
and
misery
for
me
if
we
do
not
get
just
the
right
sort
of
person
and
i
am
in
doubt
as
to
whether
there
any
right
sort
to
be
whereupon
susan
laughed
and
blushed
a
little
as
she
said
after
such
an
alarming
statement
of
the
requirements
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
the
courage
to
propose
a
friend
of
mine
she
doesn
t
lay
claim
to
any
of
the
gifts
which
you
ruth
looked
up
relieved
and
smiling
do
you
really
know
a
teacher
susan
whom
you
can
recommend
i
forgot
that
your
acquaintance
was
extensive
among
scholars
you
need
not
hesitate
to
suggest
for
i
assure
you
that
your
recommendation
would
go
further
with
judge
burnham
and
myself
than
any
one
we
know
for
you
understand
the
situation
and
your
judgment
is
to
be
relied
upon
of
whom
are
you
thinking
and
where
is
she
to
be
found
i
can
almost
promise
her
a
whereupon
susan
laughed
outright
really
she
said
you
make
it
very
embarrassing
work
for
me
i
not
only
have
to
recommend
myself
but
actually
force
myself
upon
your
observation
but
since
i
intend
to
teach
in
the
future
as
i
have
done
in
the
past
why
not
try
me
for
awhile
since
i
am
here
i
think
i
would
do
until
the
girls
were
ready
for
somebody
who
could
do
if
she
had
been
watching
her
sister
s
face
she
would
have
seen
the
puzzled
look
change
to
one
of
radiant
delight
then
that
sister
did
what
to
one
of
her
undemonstrative
nature
was
a
strange
thing
to
crossed
to
susan
s
side
and
bending
down
kissed
her
eagerly
on
either
cheek
i
believe
i
am
an
idiot
she
said
though
i
used
to
think
i
was
capable
of
planning
as
well
as
most
persons
but
i
never
once
thought
of
it
and
i
knew
you
meant
to
teach
too
it
is
the
very
thing
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
judge
burnham
will
think
so
too
oh
susan
you
are
one
of
my
greatest
comforts
chapter
xxvi
these
be
thy
at
last
in
ruth
burnham
s
home
life
settled
into
routine
everything
was
as
she
had
planned
it
she
had
tried
two
ways
of
life
for
a
season
almost
everything
had
gone
contrary
to
her
desires
and
plans
then
there
came
this
period
wherein
she
was
permitted
to
carry
out
in
detail
all
the
schemes
which
seemed
to
her
wise
in
the
earlier
days
of
her
christian
experience
she
had
felt
if
she
did
not
say
that
if
she
could
but
have
the
control
of
her
own
affairs
humanly
speaking
she
could
make
things
work
together
in
a
different
and
more
helpful
manner
for
herself
and
her
friends
it
was
as
if
the
lord
had
taken
her
at
her
word
and
opened
the
door
for
her
to
plan
and
carry
out
according
to
her
will
the
question
was
did
she
find
it
a
success
was
she
now
at
last
a
happy
growing
whose
influence
was
felt
in
all
the
departments
of
her
life
oh
i
am
afraid
that
ruth
hated
to
admit
even
to
her
own
heart
how
far
from
success
she
felt
painful
though
the
admission
was
she
had
to
make
it
to
her
conscience
that
she
was
neither
a
growing
nor
a
happy
christian
what
was
the
trouble
why
in
her
heart
and
in
her
life
there
was
conflict
she
knew
the
right
and
too
often
she
did
it
not
give
me
such
an
experience
as
that
and
you
may
be
sure
that
you
have
given
the
record
of
an
unhappy
and
an
unfruitful
life
there
were
so
many
ways
in
which
ruth
could
see
that
she
had
erred
she
meant
to
commence
in
just
the
right
way
she
had
taken
great
credit
to
herself
for
her
sacrifice
of
personal
ease
and
pleasure
for
the
taking
up
of
hard
crosses
in
connection
with
judge
burnham
s
duties
yet
now
she
saw
that
there
were
crosses
far
more
important
which
she
had
not
taken
up
at
all
almost
as
often
as
she
knelt
alone
in
her
own
room
to
pray
she
knelt
in
tears
first
because
she
was
always
alone
her
husband
never
bowed
with
her
never
read
the
bible
with
her
was
this
in
part
her
fault
what
if
in
those
first
days
when
everything
was
new
and
when
he
was
on
the
alert
to
be
her
comfort
she
had
asked
him
to
read
with
her
to
kneel
with
her
and
hear
her
pray
was
it
not
possible
that
he
might
have
done
so
well
those
first
days
were
not
so
long
gone
by
was
it
not
just
possible
that
he
might
join
her
now
alas
for
ruth
though
the
days
of
her
married
life
had
been
so
few
she
could
look
back
upon
them
and
see
inconsistencies
in
word
and
manner
and
action
which
went
far
toward
sealing
her
lips
not
that
they
should
but
is
it
not
the
painful
experience
of
each
one
of
us
that
they
so
often
do
if
ruth
had
but
commenced
right
it
is
so
hard
to
make
a
beginning
in
the
middle
of
a
life
besides
there
had
been
many
words
spoken
by
judge
burnham
which
would
serve
to
make
it
harder
for
him
to
yield
to
any
innovations
if
she
had
but
beguiled
him
before
these
words
were
spoken
then
indeed
it
is
possible
that
some
of
them
at
least
would
never
have
been
uttered
only
a
few
weeks
a
wife
and
for
how
many
of
her
husband
s
sins
was
she
already
in
a
measure
responsible
then
the
girls
were
a
source
of
pain
to
ruth
s
conscience
not
that
they
had
not
learned
well
her
first
lessons
it
surprised
at
times
it
almost
alarmed
her
to
see
with
what
eagerness
they
caught
at
the
ribbons
and
ruffles
and
all
the
outside
adornments
of
life
they
were
entirely
willing
to
give
these
each
and
all
important
place
in
their
thoughts
she
had
given
them
intoxicating
glimpses
of
the
world
of
fashion
before
their
heads
or
hearts
were
poised
enough
not
to
be
they
had
caught
at
the
glimpse
and
made
a
fairyland
of
beauty
out
of
it
and
had
resolved
with
all
their
young
strong
might
to
belong
to
that
fairyland
and
they
looked
up
to
and
reverenced
ruth
as
the
queen
who
had
the
power
of
opening
these
enchanted
doors
to
them
you
are
to
remember
that
though
backward
they
were
by
no
means
brainless
having
been
kept
in
such
marked
seclusion
all
their
lives
until
this
sudden
opening
of
the
outer
doors
upon
them
and
this
sudden
flinging
them
into
the
very
midst
of
the
whirl
of
what
to
wear
and
how
to
make
it
hearing
little
else
during
these
first
bewildering
days
than
the
questions
concerning
this
shade
and
that
tint
and
the
comparative
merits
of
ruffles
or
plaits
and
the
comparative
qualities
of
silks
and
velvets
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
perfect
fitting
boots
and
gloves
and
hats
what
wonder
that
they
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
these
things
were
the
marks
of
power
in
the
world
and
were
second
in
importance
to
nothing
having
plunged
into
her
work
with
the
same
energy
which
characterized
all
ruth
s
movements
how
was
she
now
to
teach
the
lesson
that
these
things
were
absolutely
as
nothings
compared
with
a
hundred
other
questions
having
to
do
with
their
lives
she
worked
at
this
problem
and
saw
no
more
how
to
do
it
than
she
saw
how
to
take
back
the
first
few
weeks
of
married
life
and
personal
influence
over
her
husband
and
live
them
over
again
there
was
no
solace
in
trying
to
talk
her
difficulties
over
with
susan
because
she
while
intensely
sympathetic
in
regard
to
matters
was
gravely
silent
when
ruth
wondered
why
the
girls
were
so
suddenly
absorbed
in
the
trivialities
of
life
to
the
exclusion
of
more
important
things
and
ruth
felt
that
her
sister
recognized
share
in
the
matter
and
deplored
it
about
her
husband
she
chose
to
be
entirely
silent
herself
if
pride
had
not
kept
her
so
the
sense
of
wifely
vows
would
have
sealed
her
lips
at
least
she
had
high
and
sacred
ideas
of
marriage
vows
alas
for
ruth
there
were
other
disquieting
elements
she
realized
her
husband
s
influence
on
herself
try
as
she
would
resolve
as
she
might
steadily
she
slipped
away
from
her
former
moorings
little
things
so
called
were
the
occasions
of
the
lapses
but
they
were
not
little
in
their
effect
on
her
spiritual
life
how
is
it
possible
that
you
can
desire
to
go
to
that
stuffy
little
room
and
meet
a
dozen
illiterate
men
and
women
or
is
it
a
mistaken
sense
of
duty
which
impels
you
this
was
her
husband
s
question
regarding
the
suggestion
of
ruth
that
they
go
to
the
weekly
his
tone
was
not
unkind
but
there
was
just
a
touch
of
raillery
in
it
which
was
at
all
times
harder
for
ruth
to
bear
than
positive
coldness
you
must
be
content
to
tolerate
my
tastes
she
said
since
you
can
not
sympathize
with
them
endurance
is
the
most
that
i
can
he
laughed
now
ruth
dear
don
t
be
cross
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
of
being
so
and
i
propose
to
humor
your
whims
to
the
last
degree
i
will
even
escort
you
to
that
most
uninviting
room
and
call
for
you
again
enduring
meantime
with
what
grace
i
can
the
sorrows
of
my
country
solitude
what
more
can
you
expect
but
in
return
for
such
magnanimity
you
might
enlighten
my
curiosity
why
do
you
go
how
can
i
help
being
curious
in
town
now
it
was
different
while
i
might
even
there
question
your
choice
of
entertainments
at
least
you
met
people
of
culture
with
whom
you
had
certain
ideas
in
common
but
really
and
truly
my
dear
wife
i
am
at
home
in
this
region
of
country
so
far
as
knowledge
of
the
mental
caliber
of
the
people
is
concerned
and
i
assure
you
you
will
look
in
vain
for
a
man
or
woman
of
brains
outside
of
the
is
well
enough
i
suppose
though
he
is
a
perfect
bore
to
is
a
general
and
most
alarming
paucity
of
ideas
besides
which
there
is
no
gas
in
the
church
you
know
and
kerosene
lamps
are
fearful
at
their
best
and
these
i
judge
are
at
their
worst
so
taking
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
i
think
i
am
justified
in
asking
what
can
be
your
motive
is
it
any
wonder
that
there
were
tears
in
ruth
s
eyes
as
she
turned
them
toward
her
husband
how
explain
to
one
who
would
not
understand
the
meaning
of
her
terms
why
she
sought
the
little
country
judge
burnham
she
said
speaking
slowly
and
trying
to
choose
the
words
with
care
is
it
unknown
to
you
that
i
profess
to
expect
to
meet
there
with
the
lord
jesus
christ
oh
that
indeed
he
said
and
the
lightness
of
his
tone
so
jarred
on
her
that
she
shivered
i
believe
that
is
an
article
in
your
creed
i
don
t
discredit
it
in
its
intellectual
and
spiritual
sense
but
what
does
it
prove
i
suppose
you
meet
him
equally
in
this
room
and
i
suppose
the
surroundings
of
this
room
are
as
conducive
to
communion
with
the
unseen
presence
as
are
those
of
that
forlorn
little
square
box
of
a
church
isn
t
that
the
most
doleful
building
for
a
church
that
it
was
ever
your
misery
to
see
it
is
abominably
ventilated
for
that
matter
churches
nearly
always
are
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
thing
in
church
creeds
that
conscientiously
holds
people
from
observing
the
laws
of
health
and
comfort
i
don
t
believe
there
is
an
in
the
united
states
that
would
be
tolerated
for
a
season
if
the
question
of
light
and
heat
and
ventilation
had
been
ignored
in
it
as
entirely
as
they
are
in
what
was
there
to
be
said
to
such
as
he
perhaps
ruth
said
the
best
thing
under
the
circumstances
well
come
don
t
let
us
discuss
the
subject
further
there
is
the
bell
please
take
me
down
to
the
poor
little
church
for
i
really
want
to
certainly
he
said
rising
promptly
and
making
ready
with
a
air
he
attended
her
to
the
very
door
and
was
on
its
threshold
in
waiting
when
the
hour
of
prayer
was
over
and
was
gracious
and
attentive
in
the
extreme
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
making
no
allusion
to
the
after
the
first
few
mischievous
and
pointed
questions
as
to
the
exercises
questions
which
tried
ruth
s
nerves
to
the
utmost
for
the
reason
that
the
little
meeting
had
been
so
utterly
devoid
of
anything
like
life
and
earnestness
that
it
was
a
trial
rather
than
a
help
to
her
conversations
not
unlike
these
were
common
on
evening
always
conducted
on
judge
burnham
s
part
in
the
most
gracious
spirit
ending
by
accompanying
her
to
the
church
door
she
ceased
to
ask
him
to
enter
for
the
reason
that
she
was
not
sure
but
it
would
be
a
positive
injury
to
him
to
do
so
one
wednesday
evening
he
followed
her
to
the
parlor
with
a
petition
now
wifie
i
have
been
most
patiently
good
every
meeting
evening
since
i
had
you
all
to
myself
having
given
you
up
if
not
willingly
at
least
uncomplainingly
to
the
companionship
of
those
who
are
neither
elevating
nor
inspiriting
now
it
is
your
turn
to
show
yourself
unselfish
i
m
a
victim
to
one
of
my
headaches
and
want
you
to
take
care
of
to
which
proposition
ruth
instantly
pang
of
conscience
which
she
felt
being
not
on
account
of
the
wife
s
obvious
duty
to
care
for
a
sick
husband
but
because
of
the
instant
throb
of
relief
of
which
she
was
conscious
in
having
a
legitimate
reason
for
escaping
the
it
was
too
painfully
apparent
even
to
her
own
heart
that
she
had
not
enjoyed
the
hour
of
religious
communion
that
she
had
sighed
inwardly
when
the
door
closed
after
her
retreating
husband
and
she
had
gone
back
eagerly
to
his
companionship
directly
after
the
hour
of
separation
was
over
it
transpired
that
on
this
occasion
his
headache
was
not
so
severe
but
that
it
admitted
of
his
being
entertained
by
his
wife
s
voice
reading
aloud
and
he
was
presently
so
far
recovered
as
to
sit
up
and
join
in
her
reading
giving
her
a
lesson
in
the
true
rendering
of
shakespeare
which
was
most
enjoyable
to
both
on
the
following
wednesday
there
was
a
concert
of
unusual
interest
in
the
city
and
ruth
obeyed
her
husband
s
summons
by
telegraph
to
come
down
on
the
six
o
clock
train
and
attend
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
have
him
wait
in
the
city
for
her
and
disappoint
him
another
wednesday
and
she
went
again
to
the
little
meeting
but
it
had
in
the
interim
grown
more
distasteful
to
her
and
indeed
there
was
this
excuse
for
poor
ruth
that
the
meeting
was
one
of
the
dullest
of
its
kind
there
were
no
outside
influences
helping
her
it
was
a
matter
of
hard
duty
between
her
and
her
conscience
perhaps
when
we
consider
that
human
nature
is
what
it
is
we
should
not
think
it
strange
that
six
weeks
after
the
concert
found
ruth
accepting
an
invitation
to
a
select
party
in
town
forgetting
utterly
until
in
her
estimation
the
acceptance
was
beyond
recall
that
it
was
wednesday
evening
when
she
remembered
it
she
told
her
conscience
somewhat
roughly
that
wives
certainly
had
duties
which
they
owed
to
their
i
have
given
you
now
only
a
specimen
out
of
many
influences
which
slowly
and
surely
drew
ruth
down
stream
susan
looking
on
feeling
for
the
present
powerless
except
as
that
left
her
felt
oftener
perhaps
than
any
other
command
the
force
of
that
one
sentence
thou
shall
have
no
other
gods
yet
was
not
ruth
burnham
happy
perhaps
she
had
never
in
her
most
discontented
hours
been
further
from
happiness
her
conscience
was
too
enlightened
and
had
in
the
last
two
years
been
too
well
cultivated
for
her
not
to
know
that
she
was
going
contrary
very
often
to
her
former
ideas
of
right
too
surely
she
felt
that
her
husband
s
views
her
husband
s
tastes
her
husband
s
plans
of
life
were
at
variance
with
hers
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
about
his
yielding
and
being
led
he
could
yield
to
the
inevitable
and
there
is
a
way
of
appearing
to
yield
gracefully
too
which
develops
itself
as
only
a
to
the
end
that
one
may
gain
one
s
own
way
this
method
judge
burnham
understood
in
all
its
details
his
wife
early
in
their
married
life
began
to
realize
it
she
began
to
understand
that
he
was
in
a
quiet
persistent
way
actually
of
the
demands
which
her
religion
made
upon
her
time
and
heart
it
was
not
that
he
deliberately
meant
to
overthrow
this
power
which
held
her
rather
he
sought
in
a
patient
way
to
undermine
it
perhaps
if
ruth
had
realized
this
she
might
have
been
more
on
her
guard
but
satan
had
succeeded
in
blinding
her
eyes
by
that
most
specious
of
all
reasonings
that
she
must
by
her
concession
to
his
tastes
and
plans
win
him
over
to
her
ways
of
thinking
in
other
words
she
must
by
doing
wrong
convince
him
of
the
beauty
that
there
is
in
a
consistent
christian
life
and
win
him
to
the
right
way
in
matters
pertaining
to
this
life
ruth
s
lip
would
have
curled
in
scorn
over
such
logic
why
was
it
that
she
could
not
see
plainly
the
ground
whereon
she
trod
is
there
then
no
rest
in
the
christian
life
is
the
promise
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
utterly
void
and
worthless
has
not
god
called
his
children
to
peace
is
there
no
peace
which
passeth
understanding
such
as
the
world
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
why
did
not
ruth
burnham
with
her
educated
mind
and
clear
brain
ponder
these
things
and
determine
whether
when
she
told
herself
that
of
course
one
must
expect
conflict
and
in
this
life
she
was
not
thereby
making
the
eternal
god
false
to
his
covenants
what
was
the
trouble
why
the
same
thing
which
comes
in
so
continually
with
its
weary
divided
heart
whosoever
therefore
will
be
a
friend
of
the
world
is
the
enemy
of
god
that
old
solemn
truth
remains
after
eighteen
hundred
years
of
experience
a
which
many
a
soul
has
proved
and
ruth
burnham
had
need
to
learn
that
it
matters
not
whether
the
world
be
represented
by
a
general
glitter
or
by
a
loving
husband
so
that
the
object
of
special
choice
was
placed
solemn
effect
must
follow
chapter
xxvii
the
baptism
of
suffering
in
the
course
of
time
it
became
to
susan
erskine
who
was
watching
with
eager
interest
the
story
of
her
sister
s
life
a
question
of
painful
moment
as
to
how
the
watchful
christ
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
straying
sheep
for
as
the
days
passed
it
grew
most
painfully
apparent
that
ruth
straying
she
did
not
gain
in
the
least
this
being
the
case
it
is
of
course
equivalent
to
saying
that
she
lost
steadily
her
husband
proved
the
fact
that
his
was
the
stronger
nature
and
that
he
was
leading
not
being
led
yet
his
wife
did
not
get
entirely
out
of
the
far
enough
out
indeed
to
claim
the
few
pitiful
returns
that
the
world
has
for
service
she
staid
always
in
that
wretched
middle
state
not
belonging
to
the
world
fully
nor
yet
fully
to
christ
hence
continuous
soreness
of
heart
developing
alternately
in
gloom
and
irritability
there
came
at
last
a
messenger
to
her
home
and
little
tender
helpless
one
just
helpless
enough
and
clinging
enough
to
gather
all
the
tendrils
of
the
heart
around
and
bind
them
closely
how
that
baby
was
loved
there
have
been
babies
loved
a
heart
has
bowed
before
the
shrine
of
such
an
idol
but
perhaps
never
baby
from
grandfather
down
to
the
little
hired
nurse
whose
duty
it
was
in
the
course
of
time
to
keep
said
baby
amused
had
such
patient
persistent
willing
slaves
as
had
this
young
heir
of
the
house
of
burnham
as
for
ruth
she
found
that
she
had
never
even
of
the
depth
of
a
sort
of
general
interest
in
healthy
cleanly
children
had
been
one
of
her
pastimes
she
had
imagined
herself
somewhat
fond
of
certain
types
of
childhood
while
aware
that
she
shrank
in
horror
from
certain
other
types
but
this
new
strange
rush
of
emotions
which
filled
her
heart
almost
to
bursting
was
an
experience
of
which
she
had
had
no
conception
from
that
hour
those
who
watched
ruth
anxiously
to
see
whether
the
sweet
young
life
which
was
a
part
of
herself
would
win
her
back
to
her
covenant
vows
saw
with
pain
that
this
soul
was
only
another
and
a
stronger
idol
with
all
the
fierceness
of
her
strong
nature
with
all
the
unrest
of
her
dissatisfied
heart
did
the
mother
bow
before
this
tiny
soul
and
bring
it
worship
she
discovered
at
last
that
was
easy
that
sleepless
nights
and
restless
days
and
the
pressure
of
many
cares
and
responsibilities
were
as
nothing
provided
baby
s
comfort
demanded
any
or
all
of
these
now
she
withdrew
entirely
from
the
and
ceased
her
fitful
attempts
at
being
identified
with
the
she
was
even
most
rare
in
her
attendance
on
the
regular
sabbath
service
did
not
baby
require
a
mother
s
care
this
was
her
surely
if
anything
ever
therefore
she
was
to
consider
it
as
a
work
from
him
there
is
no
error
so
fatal
as
a
truth
to
be
sure
this
theory
was
not
carried
out
in
all
respects
the
mother
found
time
for
social
life
she
was
seen
frequently
at
concerts
and
lectures
and
entertainments
of
various
sorts
but
this
she
said
was
a
duty
she
owed
to
her
husband
and
it
really
seemed
as
though
there
were
no
voice
left
in
her
heart
to
remind
her
that
the
duties
she
owed
to
christ
were
being
neglected
and
susan
watching
and
waiting
began
to
ask
her
heart
half
fearfully
how
will
he
speak
to
her
next
that
he
speak
to
her
and
that
effectually
she
fully
believed
for
ruth
was
surely
one
of
his
own
how
strange
that
she
wander
and
make
it
necessary
for
the
shepherd
to
seek
her
with
bleeding
feet
over
the
mountains
wild
and
bare
instead
of
resting
securely
and
sweetly
within
the
fold
meantime
the
domestic
machinery
of
the
burnham
household
worked
more
smoothly
than
it
is
always
wont
to
do
under
the
peculiar
family
relations
ruth
whatever
her
faults
was
fully
alive
to
the
special
cause
of
comfort
in
her
household
she
never
ceased
to
realize
that
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
of
her
lot
in
life
was
the
sudden
descent
upon
her
of
a
sister
such
a
faithful
thoughtful
sister
who
really
seemed
to
be
as
wise
as
a
serpent
and
as
harmless
as
a
even
ruth
though
she
had
an
idea
that
she
fully
appreciated
her
did
not
see
the
extent
of
her
influence
over
those
untutored
girls
daily
her
power
over
them
increased
the
development
in
them
mentally
was
something
of
which
their
father
was
unceasingly
proud
not
the
less
perhaps
did
it
give
him
satisfaction
because
there
was
coupled
with
it
a
development
of
refinement
of
tone
and
manner
a
growing
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
an
evident
and
hearty
relish
for
the
advantages
which
his
wealth
was
able
to
afford
them
over
one
thing
susan
pondered
and
prayed
and
watched
with
no
little
anxiety
the
girls
were
willing
to
be
her
pupils
in
any
other
study
save
that
of
personal
religion
they
were
in
a
degree
interested
in
bible
study
they
by
no
means
shrank
from
it
they
respected
her
views
they
talked
freely
with
her
as
to
creeds
and
doctrines
but
when
it
came
to
pressing
their
personal
need
of
christ
as
a
saviour
from
sin
they
were
strangely
apathetic
had
they
inherited
their
father
s
distaste
for
all
the
personalities
of
religion
susan
questioned
or
had
their
first
delicious
glimpse
of
this
new
world
given
under
the
new
mother
s
tutelage
so
stamped
their
ambitions
that
they
had
no
room
for
deeper
thoughts
from
this
last
solution
she
shrank
it
made
such
an
awfully
solemn
matter
of
personal
responsibility
yet
when
she
saw
the
almost
reverence
in
which
they
held
this
new
mother
s
views
of
whatever
pertained
to
outside
life
she
could
not
but
feel
that
there
had
been
stamped
upon
their
hearts
the
belief
that
she
who
had
reigned
so
long
in
the
fashionable
world
knew
all
about
the
important
things
and
shown
them
what
they
at
least
susan
felt
sure
that
could
ruth
have
realized
the
influences
she
possessed
over
the
unformed
minds
of
her
two
daughters
she
would
have
shrunken
from
using
it
for
trivialities
as
for
ruth
the
girls
had
become
secondary
matters
to
her
she
had
carried
her
point
she
had
proved
that
dress
and
attention
to
the
many
refinements
of
life
would
make
a
vast
difference
in
these
two
she
had
shown
their
father
that
it
was
through
sheer
neglect
that
they
grew
to
be
the
painful
trials
which
they
were
she
had
proved
to
him
that
her
course
was
the
right
one
there
was
no
skeleton
in
their
country
home
now
to
be
avoided
painfully
the
girls
were
not
perfect
in
deportment
it
is
true
but
so
rapid
had
been
their
advancement
in
certain
ways
and
so
skillful
was
the
brain
which
planned
their
outward
adornings
that
they
might
safely
endure
introductions
as
judge
burnham
s
daughters
in
any
circle
where
it
was
desirable
to
present
them
ruth
felt
watching
them
that
even
the
famous
criminal
lawyer
himself
would
never
have
recognized
in
them
the
two
distressing
specimens
which
he
had
characterized
as
discarded
american
she
had
shown
her
husband
also
that
country
life
was
not
only
endurable
but
in
many
respects
desirable
indeed
so
satisfied
had
he
become
with
his
lovely
rural
home
that
when
it
was
announced
as
important
for
baby
s
health
that
the
entire
season
should
be
spent
there
he
offered
no
objection
and
agreed
with
alacrity
to
ruth
s
plan
that
susan
should
take
the
girls
for
a
peep
at
life
at
long
branch
and
leave
them
to
the
solitude
of
home
very
well
he
had
said
provided
you
will
on
their
return
leave
susan
in
charge
of
his
lordship
and
run
away
with
me
to
the
mountains
for
a
few
and
ruth
had
laughed
and
shrugged
her
handsome
shoulders
and
exclaimed
over
the
folly
of
trying
to
coax
a
mother
from
her
baby
for
any
mountains
in
the
world
and
then
she
had
looked
proudly
over
toward
the
crib
and
rejoiced
in
the
fact
that
the
hero
sleeping
there
had
power
enough
to
hold
father
as
well
as
mother
a
meek
worshipper
at
his
shrine
for
if
judge
burnham
really
an
idolater
his
only
son
was
the
supreme
idol
in
his
inmost
heart
so
the
summer
plans
were
carried
out
ruth
serenely
discussed
seaside
outfits
and
decided
with
the
tone
of
one
who
realized
that
her
word
was
law
as
to
whether
minta
would
look
better
in
a
evening
dress
and
whether
seraph
was
too
young
for
a
one
long
ago
susan
apparently
without
thought
on
the
subject
had
started
the
habit
of
softening
the
objectional
name
into
this
euphonious
one
and
ruth
remarked
to
her
husband
that
perhaps
time
would
develop
the
fact
that
there
was
almost
a
prophecy
in
the
name
if
sereph
s
voice
continued
to
develop
in
strength
and
sweetness
under
culture
on
the
whole
there
was
serene
satisfaction
in
the
survey
of
her
handiwork
where
these
girls
were
concerned
they
bade
fair
to
do
justice
to
her
discernment
and
afford
food
for
pride
still
as
i
said
they
were
secondary
so
that
they
were
always
well
dressed
and
sat
properly
at
table
and
entered
a
room
properly
and
bowed
gracefully
to
her
callers
and
treated
her
with
unfailing
respect
she
was
at
rest
concerning
them
she
had
so
trodden
her
conscience
under
foot
that
in
these
days
had
she
really
very
little
trouble
in
the
thought
that
her
for
them
had
ignored
the
which
life
had
for
any
soul
susan
packed
and
arranged
and
listened
to
her
numerous
directions
and
went
off
to
take
her
first
summering
away
from
cares
which
of
one
sort
or
another
had
held
her
for
a
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
on
her
face
which
was
not
for
herself
nor
yet
because
of
her
responsibility
in
regard
to
these
two
unfledged
worldlings
but
for
the
christian
mother
hovering
over
the
crib
in
the
nursery
and
her
heart
went
murmuring
how
will
he
speak
to
her
next
not
many
days
after
the
next
call
of
the
shepherd
came
you
are
prepared
to
hear
what
it
little
sheltered
baby
fell
sick
not
very
sick
not
so
but
that
the
doctor
went
and
came
with
a
cheery
air
and
told
the
anxious
mother
that
they
would
have
her
darling
as
chirk
as
ever
in
a
day
or
two
and
judge
burnham
believed
him
and
laughed
at
the
mother
s
dreary
face
and
made
light
of
her
fears
but
poor
ruth
did
believe
him
and
went
about
her
mother
cares
and
hung
over
her
sick
darling
with
an
deadening
weight
at
her
heart
he
was
not
the
family
physician
of
the
burnham
didn
t
believe
in
so
the
coming
and
going
doctor
was
the
one
associated
with
the
dark
days
wherein
they
had
waited
and
watched
over
ruth
s
father
whether
it
was
that
association
or
whatever
it
was
ruth
shrank
a
little
from
bacon
and
was
not
able
to
give
him
her
full
confidence
dark
days
were
these
and
they
dragged
their
slow
lengths
along
and
brought
regularly
the
longer
and
darker
nights
for
it
is
at
night
that
we
hang
most
hopelessly
over
our
sick
and
the
silence
and
quietness
of
the
home
grew
oppressive
to
ruth
she
wished
for
susan
she
would
gladly
have
had
the
girls
coming
and
going
yet
it
seemed
foolish
to
send
for
them
there
was
a
skillful
nurse
and
there
were
neighbors
who
though
they
had
been
almost
ignored
by
the
fine
family
at
the
hill
yet
directly
they
heard
that
there
was
sickness
came
and
went
with
their
thoughtful
offers
of
assistance
why
even
ferris
with
her
loud
voice
and
her
uncouth
ways
came
and
was
welcomed
by
ruth
because
of
the
humble
work
which
she
did
in
the
kitchen
that
tended
to
baby
s
comfort
and
still
the
doctor
came
and
went
with
his
story
that
the
baby
would
be
all
right
in
a
few
days
but
the
days
of
mending
did
not
come
and
the
shadow
deepened
and
darkened
though
as
yet
it
seemed
to
be
seen
only
by
the
mother
s
heart
and
in
that
heart
a
war
was
being
waged
which
in
fierceness
and
length
of
conflict
so
far
transcended
all
ruth
s
other
struggles
with
life
as
to
make
them
pale
into
nothingness
before
her
and
the
struggle
was
such
that
no
human
heart
could
intermeddle
for
it
was
between
ruth
and
god
she
realized
in
those
days
that
she
had
actually
had
many
a
struggle
with
the
great
god
before
without
recognizing
it
as
such
or
at
least
calling
it
by
its
right
name
at
first
there
was
wild
fierce
rebellion
she
clung
to
her
baby
held
him
indeed
so
fiercely
that
he
wailed
feebly
and
looked
up
into
her
face
almost
in
terror
and
she
cried
out
that
she
could
him
up
no
not
even
to
the
giver
and
the
little
face
grew
daily
more
wasted
and
the
little
hands
more
feeble
and
the
moments
of
wakeful
recognition
shorter
and
the
hours
of
half
stupor
longer
and
the
doctor
grew
less
cheery
when
he
came
and
judge
burnham
grew
restless
and
later
every
day
to
town
and
returned
earlier
and
was
in
his
silent
restrained
yet
passionate
way
fully
as
rebellious
as
his
wife
chapter
xxviii
the
oil
of
even
yet
the
doctor
had
said
no
word
of
discouragement
and
judge
burnham
had
though
he
had
ceased
laughing
at
ruth
fears
sharply
controverted
them
and
she
felt
she
would
have
stricken
down
any
one
who
had
breathed
a
word
of
danger
it
was
fearful
enough
to
feel
it
let
no
one
dare
to
it
once
when
judge
with
pity
for
her
loneliness
during
the
hours
when
he
was
obliged
to
be
recalling
the
travellers
she
turned
toward
him
fiercely
why
she
asked
him
what
do
you
mean
are
you
keeping
something
from
me
does
the
doctor
tell
you
what
he
does
not
me
judge
burnham
i
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
deceive
why
no
he
said
ruth
no
why
will
you
be
so
unreasonable
the
doctor
says
he
sees
no
ground
as
yet
for
special
anxiety
he
says
to
me
just
what
he
says
to
you
no
one
thinks
of
deception
i
only
felt
that
it
would
be
less
lonely
with
the
girls
at
home
and
susan
would
be
a
comfort
she
said
still
speaking
sharply
why
have
i
need
of
comfort
i
have
my
baby
and
i
can
take
care
of
him
and
as
for
loneliness
the
house
is
full
from
morning
till
night
one
would
think
people
never
heard
of
a
sick
child
before
they
are
always
sick
when
teething
why
should
we
be
so
unreasonably
frightened
and
judge
burnham
turned
away
sighing
patient
with
his
wife
for
he
saw
that
she
was
too
wildly
frightened
to
talk
or
act
like
a
reasonable
being
among
all
the
comers
and
goers
there
was
one
who
did
not
come
that
was
judge
erskine
not
that
she
would
not
have
willingly
been
there
both
day
and
night
but
poor
ruth
who
had
never
recovered
in
the
least
from
her
early
discomfort
concerning
the
woman
in
this
time
of
her
frenzy
felt
the
dislike
increasing
to
almost
hatred
she
tortured
herself
at
times
with
imagining
the
exclamations
that
the
odious
grandmother
would
make
over
the
change
in
her
darling
until
at
last
it
grew
to
be
almost
an
insanity
to
her
and
she
fiercely
ordered
that
no
word
of
any
sort
should
be
taken
to
her
home
father
shall
not
be
needlessly
troubled
was
outward
reason
enough
for
judge
erskine
was
not
strong
this
season
so
beyond
the
knowledge
that
the
child
was
not
very
well
was
teething
and
kept
ruth
closely
at
home
the
two
people
left
in
the
old
erskine
homestead
together
knew
nothing
slowly
yet
surely
the
shepherd
was
reaching
after
his
stray
sheep
by
degrees
her
mood
and
her
prayers
changed
they
lost
their
fierceness
but
not
one
whit
of
their
she
began
to
feel
herself
in
the
hands
of
god
she
gave
up
her
defiance
and
came
to
him
as
a
suppliant
she
sat
alone
in
the
shadows
of
a
long
night
of
watching
and
looked
over
her
life
and
saw
plainly
her
mistakes
her
wanderings
her
sins
then
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
that
crib
one
watching
eye
and
listening
ear
intent
on
every
change
of
expression
or
breathing
in
the
darling
and
then
and
there
she
proceeded
to
make
terms
with
god
if
he
would
only
give
her
back
her
darling
her
boy
she
would
live
oh
a
different
life
life
of
entire
consecration
all
she
had
and
was
and
hoped
to
be
her
husband
her
should
be
consecrated
be
held
second
to
his
love
long
she
knelt
there
praying
but
no
answering
voice
spoke
peace
to
her
heart
and
the
struggle
though
changed
in
its
form
went
on
and
on
by
degrees
and
ruth
with
her
long
preoccupied
heart
was
very
slow
to
learn
the
lesson
she
was
made
to
understand
that
god
had
never
promised
to
compromise
with
his
own
never
promised
to
hear
a
prayer
which
began
with
an
entire
consecration
meant
all
the
ifs
thrown
down
at
the
feet
of
the
lord
for
him
to
control
as
he
would
solemnly
his
voice
spoke
to
her
heart
spoke
as
plainly
as
though
the
sound
of
it
had
echoed
in
the
silent
room
and
i
take
your
darling
into
my
arms
of
infinite
love
and
shield
him
for
you
in
heaven
what
then
and
ruth
realized
with
a
shudder
that
then
her
heart
said
it
would
only
be
infinite
mercy
that
could
keep
her
from
hating
god
but
when
she
realized
this
solemn
this
truth
which
proved
rebellion
in
the
heart
that
had
long
professed
allegiance
god
be
thanked
that
she
did
not
get
up
from
her
kneeling
and
go
away
again
with
the
burden
she
knelt
still
and
with
the
solemn
light
of
the
eye
flashing
down
into
her
soul
she
confessed
it
rebellion
her
selfish
determination
to
hold
her
treasure
whether
god
would
or
not
her
selfish
desire
to
compromise
her
cowardly
pitiful
subterfuge
of
promising
him
that
which
was
already
his
by
right
he
would
submit
to
her
plans
the
long
sad
sinful
story
was
laid
bare
before
him
and
then
her
torn
heart
said
oh
christ
i
can
not
help
it
i
hold
to
my
darling
and
i
give
him
up
even
when
i
would
oh
thou
saviour
of
human
souls
even
in
their
sinfulness
what
shall
i
do
did
ever
such
go
up
to
the
saviour
of
souls
in
vain
you
do
not
need
me
to
tell
you
that
before
the
dawn
of
the
coming
morning
filled
the
room
a
voice
of
power
had
spoken
peace
the
plans
and
the
subterfuges
and
the
rebellings
and
the
ifs
all
were
gone
as
thou
wilt
was
the
only
voice
left
in
that
thoroughly
bared
and
bleeding
heart
it
was
even
then
that
the
shadow
fell
the
darkest
when
the
doctor
came
next
morning
for
the
first
time
he
shook
his
head
things
do
not
look
so
hopeful
as
they
did
here
he
said
and
judge
burnham
turning
quickly
toward
his
wife
looking
to
see
her
faint
or
lose
her
reason
he
hardly
knew
which
phase
of
despair
to
expect
saw
the
pale
changed
face
is
there
no
hope
doctor
and
her
voice
though
low
was
certainly
calmer
than
it
had
been
for
days
well
said
the
doctor
relieved
at
her
method
of
receiving
his
warning
i
never
like
to
say
that
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
you
know
but
the
fact
is
i
am
disappointed
in
the
turn
that
the
trouble
has
taken
i
am
a
good
deal
afraid
of
had
ruth
spoken
her
thoughts
she
would
have
said
i
have
been
awfully
afraid
of
results
for
a
week
but
a
voice
of
greater
power
than
yours
has
spoken
to
me
now
it
rests
with
him
not
you
and
i
think
he
wants
my
what
she
say
was
ought
the
girls
to
be
summoned
well
said
bacon
regarding
her
curiously
if
it
is
important
that
they
should
be
here
i
think
i
should
then
presuming
upon
long
acquaintance
with
judge
burnham
he
said
as
they
passed
down
the
hall
together
upon
my
word
burnham
you
have
the
most
unaccountable
wife
in
the
comments
are
unnecessary
doctor
judge
burnham
said
in
his
haughtiest
tones
and
the
next
instant
the
front
door
closed
with
a
bang
and
the
father
had
shut
himself
and
his
pain
into
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
what
was
to
do
which
way
turn
how
live
he
had
never
until
this
moment
had
other
than
a
passing
anxiety
now
the
whole
crushing
weight
of
the
coming
blow
seemed
to
fall
on
him
and
he
had
not
the
force
of
habit
nor
the
knowledge
of
past
experiences
to
drive
him
to
his
knees
for
a
refuge
instead
his
fierce
heart
raved
if
ruth
had
been
in
danger
of
hating
god
he
felt
yes
actually
realized
that
his
heart
was
filled
at
this
moment
with
a
fierce
and
bitter
hatred
can
you
imagine
what
the
trials
of
that
day
were
to
ruth
have
you
any
knowledge
of
what
a
shock
it
is
to
a
torn
and
bleeding
heart
which
yet
feels
that
the
almighty
father
the
everlasting
saviour
holds
her
and
her
treasure
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
to
come
in
contact
with
one
who
fiercely
blasphemously
tramples
on
that
trust
in
this
moment
of
supreme
pain
it
was
given
to
ruth
s
conscience
to
remember
that
she
had
chosen
for
her
closest
friend
one
who
made
no
profession
of
loyalty
to
her
of
her
child
why
should
she
expect
to
rest
on
him
now
this
day
like
all
the
other
dark
ones
drew
toward
its
closing
the
doctor
watched
and
waited
for
and
dispatched
for
did
not
come
and
the
night
drew
about
them
and
it
so
happened
that
save
the
nurse
and
the
household
servants
the
father
and
mother
were
alone
with
their
baby
early
in
the
afternoon
a
sudden
remembrance
had
come
to
ruth
and
she
had
turned
from
the
crib
long
enough
to
say
let
father
and
the
messenger
had
gone
but
even
from
him
there
was
no
response
so
they
watched
and
waited
judge
burnham
in
feverish
madness
of
anxiety
paced
the
floor
and
alternately
raged
at
the
absent
doctor
for
not
coming
and
then
wished
he
might
never
look
upon
his
face
again
ruth
staid
on
her
knees
beside
that
crib
from
which
for
hours
she
had
not
moved
and
her
lips
continually
formed
that
inaudible
prayer
thy
will
be
and
really
and
truly
the
awful
bitterness
of
the
agony
was
gone
out
of
her
heart
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
crunching
the
graveled
bustle
outside
somebody
had
come
ruth
glanced
up
half
fearfully
what
was
coming
to
break
the
solemn
holiness
of
the
hour
not
the
doctor
surely
with
such
bustle
of
noise
the
door
opened
quickly
and
they
pressed
father
a
tall
stranger
just
beside
him
and
judge
erskine
pushed
past
them
both
dear
heart
she
said
bending
down
to
the
crib
but
her
words
were
for
ruth
not
the
baby
we
just
got
the
word
i
brought
parmelee
i
couldn
t
help
it
child
i
ve
seen
him
do
such
wonderful
things
your
pa
don
t
believe
in
his
bits
of
pills
you
he
said
your
husband
didn
t
but
la
what
difference
does
that
make
men
never
do
they
believe
in
getting
em
well
though
come
here
parmelee
his
pulse
is
real
strong
and
he
looks
to
me
as
though
he
and
here
erskine
paused
for
breath
she
had
been
in
the
meantime
throwing
off
her
wraps
touching
the
baby
s
hand
with
skillful
fingers
touching
the
hot
head
and
rising
at
last
to
motion
the
doctor
tall
stranger
he
came
hesitatingly
looking
toward
the
father
but
judge
burnham
caught
at
his
name
anything
he
said
hoarsely
dr
bacon
has
proved
himself
an
idiot
it
is
too
late
now
but
in
heaven
s
name
do
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
as
strange
that
such
men
as
judge
burnham
in
their
hours
of
great
mental
pain
are
very
apt
to
call
for
blessings
in
heaven
s
name
it
was
a
strange
hour
ruth
who
had
been
hushed
into
silence
and
solemnity
by
the
presence
of
the
death
angel
found
herself
whirled
into
the
very
midst
of
the
struggle
for
life
parmelee
declared
with
erskine
that
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
strength
and
he
hoped
and
then
he
stopped
talking
and
went
to
skillfully
without
commotion
of
any
sort
yet
issuing
his
orders
with
such
swiftness
and
skill
that
mother
and
nurse
especially
the
former
were
set
to
work
to
instead
of
think
especially
was
erskine
alert
seeming
to
know
by
a
sort
of
instinct
such
as
is
noticeable
in
nurses
who
have
a
special
calling
for
their
work
what
the
doctor
wanted
done
and
how
to
do
it
far
into
the
night
they
obeyed
and
watched
at
last
the
doctor
rose
up
from
a
careful
examination
of
his
little
patient
i
believe
he
said
speaking
quietly
i
believe
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
symptoms
in
the
past
two
hours
if
i
mistake
not
the
crisis
is
past
i
think
your
little
one
will
at
the
sound
of
these
words
judge
burnham
strode
over
from
his
station
at
the
head
of
the
crib
and
grasping
the
doctor
s
hand
essayed
to
speak
words
but
his
voice
choked
and
the
polished
gentleman
lost
every
vestige
of
control
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
he
is
in
god
s
hands
my
friend
the
new
doctor
said
gently
he
will
do
right
and
i
think
he
has
given
the
little
life
back
to
as
for
ruth
she
turned
one
look
away
from
her
baby
s
face
toward
the
doctor
s
and
he
said
as
he
went
out
from
the
home
i
declare
that
woman
s
eyes
paid
me
there
was
little
talk
and
much
watching
during
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
day
that
followed
erskine
kept
her
post
keeping
up
that
sort
of
alert
which
the
skillful
nurse
understands
so
well
and
which
thrills
the
heart
of
a
watcher
with
eager
hope
one
of
judge
burnham
s
first
morning
duties
was
to
send
a
curt
and
courteous
both
terms
are
bacon
asking
for
his
bill
then
his
own
carriage
waited
at
the
train
for
the
coming
of
parmelee
now
look
here
child
said
erskine
as
toward
the
midnight
of
the
following
night
ruth
turned
for
a
moment
from
the
crib
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
eyes
you
are
just
to
go
to
bed
and
get
a
night
s
sleep
we
ll
have
on
our
hands
if
you
don
t
as
sure
as
the
world
and
that
will
be
a
nice
mess
for
baby
bless
his
heart
judge
burnham
you
just
take
her
and
put
her
to
bed
i
m
going
to
sit
by
my
little
boy
here
the
whole
blessed
night
i
won
t
even
wink
and
when
i
undertake
to
watch
why
i
and
know
how
though
i
do
say
it
that
shouldn
so
through
much
protesting
from
ruth
and
overruling
by
her
father
and
husband
she
was
carried
off
to
the
room
adjoining
in
the
gray
dawn
of
another
morning
she
having
slept
for
four
hours
the
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
started
with
a
sudden
affrighted
waking
wherein
all
the
agony
of
the
past
days
flashed
over
her
and
without
waiting
to
remember
the
of
joy
rushed
to
her
nursery
there
was
the
little
crib
with
its
sleeping
treasure
there
on
the
couch
lay
the
tired
nurse
sleeping
quietly
there
at
the
crib
s
side
sat
erskine
keeping
her
faithful
tireless
vigil
she
looked
up
with
a
reassuring
smile
as
ruth
came
in
what
did
you
wake
up
for
he
s
as
nice
as
a
robin
in
a
nest
of
down
he
breathes
just
as
easy
and
the
skin
feels
moist
and
natural
see
how
his
little
hair
curls
with
the
dampness
anybody
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
he
is
a
great
deal
better
he
ll
get
on
now
real
fast
parmelee
says
so
i
never
did
see
the
like
of
them
little
pills
ain
t
bigger
than
ruth
bent
low
over
the
crib
the
bounding
pulse
was
quiet
and
steady
at
last
the
breath
came
in
slow
soft
respirations
with
no
horrible
gratings
the
beautiful
little
hand
resting
on
the
pillow
was
doubled
up
as
in
the
grace
in
which
he
held
it
when
in
health
suddenly
there
rushed
over
ruth
all
the
probabilities
of
that
solemn
night
and
all
the
blessings
of
this
hour
after
she
had
given
him
up
utterly
to
god
after
she
had
said
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
after
she
had
said
i
am
thine
forever
lord
though
with
empty
arms
then
he
had
given
her
back
her
her
one
more
chance
to
train
the
soul
for
him
with
the
thought
came
also
the
remembrance
of
the
door
through
which
he
had
opened
this
blessed
paradise
of
hope
and
she
turned
suddenly
and
burying
her
head
in
erskine
s
ample
lap
cried
out
oh
mother
mother
god
bless
you
forever
and
the
first
tears
that
her
tired
eyes
had
felt
for
a
week
fell
thick
and
fast
land
alive
said
judge
erskine
poor
dear
heart
you
are
all
tuckered
out
you
just
go
right
straight
back
to
bed
i
won
t
turn
my
eyes
away
from
him
and
he
s
all
right
anyhow
i
know
the
signs
bless
your
heart
i
nursed
stevens
baby
only
last
week
and
this
very
parmelee
was
there
and
i
saw
what
them
little
pills
and
powders
could
do
when
the
lord
chose
to
use
em
you
just
go
back
dearie
this
minute
you
can
sleep
all
day
as
well
as
not
grandma
ll
take
care
of
her
blessed
little
darling
so
she
and
ruth
went
back
to
the
bedside
and
to
her
knees
and
among
the
sentences
of
her
prayer
that
morning
was
this
from
a
full
heart
o
god
i
thank
thee
that
despite
all
the
blindness
and
rebellion
of
my
heart
thou
didst
send
to
me
a
thou
hast
given
me
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning
and

garment
of
praise
