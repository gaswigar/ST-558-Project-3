her
so
it

that
you
play

be
the

she

chapter
i
della
speaks
her
mind
della
wetherby
tripped
up
the
somewhat
imposing
steps
of
her
commonwealth
avenue
home
and
pressed
an
energetic
finger
against
the
button
from
the
tip
of
her
hat
to
the
toe
of
her
shoe
she
radiated
health
capability
and
alert
decision
even
her
voice
as
she
greeted
the
maid
that
opened
the
door
vibrated
with
the
joy
of
living
good
morning
mary
is
my
sister
in
carew
is
in
hesitated
the
girl
but
she
gave
orders
she
see
no
one
did
she
well
i
no
one
smiled
miss
wetherby
so
she
see
me
do
worry
i
take
the
blame
she
nodded
in
answer
to
the
frightened
remonstrance
in
the
girl
eyes
where
is
she
in
her
but
that
is
she
said
miss
wetherby
however
was
already
halfway
up
the
broad
stairway
and
with
a
despairing
backward
glance
the
maid
turned
away
in
the
hall
above
della
wetherby
unhesitatingly
walked
toward
a
door
and
knocked
well
mary
answered
a
voice
have
i
oh
della
the
voice
grew
suddenly
warm
with
love
and
surprise
you
dear
girl
where
did
you
come
from
yes
it
della
smiled
that
young
woman
blithely
already
halfway
across
the
room
i
come
from
an
at
the
beach
with
two
of
the
other
nurses
and
i
on
my
way
back
to
the
sanatorium
now
that
is
i
here
now
but
i
be
long
i
stepped
in
for
this
she
finished
giving
the
owner
of
the
voice
a
hearty
kiss
carew
frowned
and
drew
back
a
little
coldly
the
slight
touch
of
joy
and
animation
that
had
come
into
her
face
fled
leaving
only
a
dispirited
fretfulness
that
was
plainly
very
much
at
home
there
oh
of
course
i
might
have
known
she
said
you
never
stay
here
here
della
wetherby
laughed
merrily
and
threw
up
her
hands
then
abruptly
her
voice
and
manner
changed
she
regarded
her
sister
with
grave
tender
eyes
ruth
dear
i
could
i
just
could
live
in
this
house
you
know
i
could
she
finished
gently
carew
stirred
irritably
i
sure
i
do
see
why
not
she
fenced
della
wetherby
shook
her
head
yes
you
do
dear
you
know
i
entirely
out
of
sympathy
with
it
all
the
gloom
the
lack
of
aim
the
insistence
on
misery
and
bitterness
but
i
am
miserable
and
bitter
you
ought
not
to
be
why
not
what
have
i
to
make
me
otherwise
della
wetherby
gave
an
impatient
gesture
ruth
look
here
she
challenged
you
years
old
you
have
good
health
or
would
have
if
you
treated
yourself
properly
and
you
certainly
have
an
abundance
of
time
and
a
superabundance
of
money
surely
anybody
would
say
you
ought
to
find
something
to
do
this
glorious
morning
besides
sitting
moped
up
in
this
house
with
instructions
to
the
maid
that
you
see
no
one
but
i
do
want
to
see
anybody
then
i
make
myself
want
to
carew
sighed
wearily
and
turned
away
her
head
oh
della
why
wo
you
ever
understand
i
not
like
you
i
ca
forget
a
swift
pain
crossed
the
younger
woman
face
you
mean
jamie
i
suppose
i
do
forget
that
dear
i
could
of
course
but
moping
wo
help
us
find
him
as
if
i
had
tried
to
find
him
for
eight
long
years
and
by
something
besides
moping
flashed
carew
indignantly
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
of
course
you
have
dear
soothed
the
other
quickly
and
we
shall
keep
on
hunting
both
of
us
till
we
do
find
him
or
die
but
this
sort
of
thing
does
help
but
i
do
want
to
do
anything
else
murmured
ruth
carew
drearily
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
the
younger
woman
sat
regarding
her
sister
with
troubled
disapproving
eyes
ruth
she
said
at
last
with
a
touch
of
exasperation
forgive
me
but
are
you
always
going
to
be
like
this
you
widowed
i
admit
but
your
married
life
lasted
only
a
year
and
your
husband
was
much
older
than
yourself
you
were
little
more
than
a
child
at
the
time
and
that
one
short
year
ca
seem
much
more
than
a
dream
now
surely
that
ought
not
to
embitter
your
whole
life
no
oh
no
murmured
carew
still
drearily
then
are
you
going
to
be
always
like
this
well
of
course
if
i
could
find
jamie
yes
yes
i
know
but
ruth
dear
is
there
anything
in
the
world
but
jamie
to
make
you
any
happy
there
does
seem
to
be
that
i
can
think
of
sighed
carew
indifferently
ruth
ejaculated
her
sister
stung
into
something
very
like
anger
then
suddenly
she
laughed
oh
ruth
ruth
i
like
to
give
you
a
dose
of
pollyanna
i
do
know
any
one
who
needs
it
more
carew
stiffened
a
little
well
what
pollyanna
may
be
i
do
know
but
whatever
it
is
i
want
it
she
retorted
sharply
nettled
in
her
turn
this
is
your
beloved
sanatorium
and
i
not
your
patient
to
be
dosed
and
bossed
please
remember
della
wetherby
eyes
danced
but
her
lips
remained
unsmiling
pollyanna
is
a
medicine
my
dear
she
said
demurely
though
i
have
heard
some
people
call
her
a
tonic
pollyanna
is
a
little
girl
a
child
well
how
should
i
know
retorted
the
other
still
aggrievedly
you
have
your
so
i
sure
i
do
see
why
not
besides
you
always
recommending
something
for
me
to
take
and
you
distinctly
said
and
dose
usually
means
medicine
of
a
sort
well
pollyanna
is
a
medicine
of
a
sort
smiled
della
anyway
the
sanatorium
doctors
all
declare
that
she
better
than
any
medicine
they
can
give
she
a
little
girl
ruth
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
who
was
at
the
sanatorium
all
last
summer
and
most
of
the
winter
i
did
see
her
but
a
month
or
two
for
she
left
soon
after
i
arrived
but
that
was
long
enough
for
me
to
come
fully
under
her
spell
besides
the
whole
sanatorium
is
still
talking
pollyanna
and
playing
her
game
game
yes
nodded
della
with
a
curious
smile
her
game
never
forget
my
first
introduction
to
it
one
feature
of
her
treatment
was
particularly
disagreeable
and
even
painful
it
came
every
tuesday
morning
and
very
soon
after
my
arrival
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
give
it
to
her
i
was
dreading
it
for
i
knew
from
past
experience
with
other
children
what
to
expect
fretfulness
and
tears
if
nothing
worse
to
my
unbounded
amazement
she
greeted
me
with
a
smile
and
said
she
was
glad
to
see
me
and
if
you
believe
it
there
was
never
so
much
as
a
whimper
from
her
lips
through
the
whole
ordeal
though
i
knew
i
was
hurting
her
cruelly
i
fancy
i
must
have
said
something
that
showed
my
surprise
for
she
explained
earnestly
yes
i
used
to
feel
that
way
too
and
i
did
dread
it
so
till
i
happened
to
think
was
just
like
and
i
could
be
gladdest
of
all
on
tuesdays
there
would
be
another
one
for
a
whole
week
why
how
extraordinary
frowned
carew
not
quite
comprehending
but
i
sure
i
do
see
any
game
to
that
no
i
did
till
later
then
she
told
me
it
seems
she
was
the
motherless
daughter
of
a
poor
minister
in
the
west
and
was
brought
up
by
the
ladies
aid
society
and
missionary
barrels
when
she
was
a
tiny
girl
she
wanted
a
doll
and
confidently
expected
it
in
the
next
barrel
but
there
turned
out
to
be
nothing
but
a
pair
of
little
crutches
the
child
cried
of
course
and
it
was
then
that
her
father
taught
her
the
game
of
hunting
for
something
to
be
glad
about
in
everything
that
happened
and
he
said
she
could
begin
right
then
by
being
glad
she
did
need
the
crutches
that
was
the
beginning
pollyanna
said
it
was
a
lovely
game
and
she
been
playing
it
ever
since
and
that
the
harder
it
was
to
find
the
glad
part
the
more
fun
it
was
only
when
it
was
too
awful
hard
like
she
had
found
it
sometimes
why
how
extraordinary
murmured
carew
still
not
entirely
comprehending
you
think
so
if
you
could
see
the
results
of
that
game
in
the
sanatorium
nodded
della
and
ames
says
he
hears
revolutionized
the
whole
town
where
she
came
from
just
the
same
way
he
knows
chilton
very
well
the
man
that
married
pollyanna
aunt
and
by
the
way
i
believe
that
marriage
was
one
of
her
ministrations
she
patched
up
an
old
lovers
quarrel
between
them
you
see
two
years
ago
or
more
pollyanna
father
died
and
the
little
girl
was
sent
east
to
this
aunt
in
october
she
was
hurt
by
an
automobile
and
was
told
she
could
never
walk
again
in
april
chilton
sent
her
to
the
sanatorium
and
she
was
there
till
last
march
almost
a
year
she
went
home
practically
cured
you
should
have
seen
the
child
there
was
just
one
cloud
to
mar
her
happiness
that
she
could
walk
all
the
way
there
as
near
as
i
can
gather
the
whole
town
turned
out
to
meet
her
with
brass
bands
and
banners
but
you
ca
tell
about
pollyanna
one
has
to
see
her
and
why
i
say
i
wish
you
could
have
a
dose
of
pollyanna
it
would
do
you
a
world
of
good
carew
lifted
her
chin
a
little
really
indeed
i
must
say
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
she
returned
coldly
i
do
care
to
be
and
i
have
no
quarrel
to
be
patched
up
and
if
there
is
anything
that
would
be
insufferable
to
me
it
would
be
a
little
miss
prim
with
a
long
face
preaching
to
me
how
much
i
had
to
be
thankful
for
i
never
could
bear
but
a
ringing
laugh
interrupted
her
oh
ruth
ruth
choked
her
sister
gleefully
miss
prim
indeed
pollyanna
oh
oh
if
only
you
could
see
that
child
now
but
there
i
might
have
known
i
said
one
could
tell
about
pollyanna
and
of
course
you
wo
be
apt
to
see
her
but
miss
prim
indeed
and
off
she
went
into
another
gale
of
laughter
almost
at
once
however
she
sobered
and
gazed
at
her
sister
with
the
old
troubled
look
in
her
eyes
seriously
dear
ca
anything
be
done
she
pleaded
you
ought
not
to
waste
your
life
like
this
wo
you
try
to
get
out
a
little
more
and
meet
people
why
should
i
when
i
do
want
to
i
tired
of
people
you
know
society
always
bored
me
then
why
not
try
some
sort
of
work
charity
carew
gave
an
impatient
gesture
della
dear
we
been
all
over
this
before
i
do
give
money
lots
of
it
and
that
enough
in
fact
i
not
sure
but
it
too
much
i
do
believe
in
pauperizing
people
but
if
you
give
a
little
of
yourself
dear
ventured
della
gently
if
you
could
only
get
interested
in
something
outside
of
your
own
life
it
would
help
so
much
and
now
della
dear
interrupted
the
elder
sister
restively
i
love
you
and
i
love
to
have
you
come
here
but
i
simply
can
not
endure
being
preached
to
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
turn
yourself
into
an
angel
of
mercy
and
give
cups
of
cold
water
and
bandage
up
broken
heads
and
all
that
perhaps
you
can
forget
jamie
that
way
but
i
could
it
would
only
make
me
think
of
him
all
the
more
wondering
if
he
had
any
one
to
give
him
water
and
bandage
up
his
head
besides
the
whole
thing
would
be
very
distasteful
to
me
mixing
with
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
people
like
that
did
you
ever
try
it
why
no
of
course
not
carew
voice
was
scornfully
indignant
then
how
can
you
know
till
you
do
try
asked
the
young
nurse
rising
to
her
feet
a
little
wearily
but
i
must
go
dear
i
to
meet
the
girls
at
the
south
station
our
train
goes
at
sorry
if
i
made
you
cross
with
me
she
finished
as
she
kissed
her
sister
i
not
cross
with
you
della
sighed
carew
but
if
you
only
would
understand
one
minute
later
della
wetherby
made
her
way
through
the
silent
gloomy
halls
and
out
to
the
street
face
step
and
manner
were
very
different
from
what
they
had
been
when
she
tripped
up
the
steps
less
than
half
an
hour
before
all
the
alertness
the
springiness
the
joy
of
living
were
gone
for
half
a
block
she
listlessly
dragged
one
foot
after
the
other
then
suddenly
she
threw
back
her
head
and
drew
a
long
breath
one
week
in
that
house
would
kill
me
she
shuddered
i
believe
even
pollyanna
herself
could
so
much
as
make
a
dent
in
the
gloom
and
the
only
thing
she
could
be
glad
for
there
would
be
that
she
did
have
to
stay
that
this
avowed
disbelief
in
pollyanna
ability
to
bring
about
a
change
for
the
better
in
carew
home
was
not
della
real
opinion
however
was
quickly
proved
for
no
sooner
had
the
nurse
reached
the
sanatorium
than
she
learned
something
that
sent
her
flying
back
over
the
journey
to
boston
the
very
next
day
so
exactly
as
before
did
she
find
circumstances
at
her
sister
home
that
it
seemed
almost
as
if
carew
had
not
moved
since
she
left
her
ruth
she
burst
out
eagerly
after
answering
her
sister
surprised
greeting
i
just
had
to
come
and
you
must
this
once
yield
to
me
and
let
me
have
my
way
listen
you
can
have
that
little
pollyanna
here
i
think
if
you
will
but
i
wo
returned
carew
with
chilly
promptness
della
wetherby
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
she
plunged
on
excitedly
when
i
got
back
yesterday
i
found
that
ames
had
had
a
letter
from
chilton
the
one
who
married
pollyanna
aunt
you
know
well
it
seems
in
it
he
said
he
was
going
to
germany
for
the
winter
for
a
special
course
and
was
going
to
take
his
wife
with
him
if
he
could
persuade
her
that
pollyanna
would
be
all
right
in
some
boarding
school
here
meantime
but
chilton
did
want
to
leave
pollyanna
in
just
a
school
and
so
he
was
afraid
she
would
go
and
now
ruth
our
chance
i
want
you
to
take
pollyanna
this
winter
and
let
her
go
to
some
school
around
here
what
an
absurd
idea
della
as
if
i
wanted
a
child
here
to
bother
with
she
wo
bother
a
bit
she
must
be
nearly
or
quite
thirteen
by
this
time
and
she
the
most
capable
little
thing
you
ever
saw
i
do
like
children
retorted
carew
perversely
but
she
laughed
and
because
she
did
laugh
her
sister
took
sudden
courage
and
redoubled
her
efforts
perhaps
it
was
the
suddenness
of
the
appeal
or
the
novelty
of
it
perhaps
it
was
because
the
story
of
pollyanna
had
somehow
touched
ruth
carew
heart
perhaps
it
was
only
her
unwillingness
to
refuse
her
sister
impassioned
plea
whatever
it
was
that
finally
turned
the
scale
when
della
wetherby
took
her
hurried
leave
half
an
hour
later
she
carried
with
her
ruth
carew
promise
to
receive
pollyanna
into
her
home
but
just
remember
carew
warned
her
at
parting
just
remember
that
the
minute
that
child
begins
to
preach
to
me
and
to
tell
me
to
count
my
mercies
back
she
goes
to
you
and
you
may
do
what
you
please
with
her
keep
her
i
remember
but
i
not
worrying
any
nodded
the
younger
woman
in
farewell
to
herself
she
whispered
as
she
hurried
away
from
the
house
half
my
job
is
done
now
for
the
other
half
to
get
pollyanna
to
come
but
she
just
got
to
come
i
write
that
letter
so
they
ca
help
letting
her
come
chapter
ii
some
old
friends
in
beldingsville
that
august
day
chilton
waited
until
pollyanna
had
gone
to
bed
before
she
spoke
to
her
husband
about
the
letter
that
had
come
in
the
morning
mail
for
that
matter
she
would
have
had
to
wait
anyway
for
crowded
office
hours
and
the
doctor
two
long
drives
over
the
hills
had
left
no
time
for
domestic
conferences
it
was
about
nine
indeed
when
the
doctor
entered
his
wife
his
tired
face
lighted
at
sight
of
her
but
at
once
a
perplexed
questioning
came
to
his
eyes
why
polly
dear
what
is
it
he
asked
concernedly
his
wife
gave
a
rueful
laugh
well
it
a
letter
though
i
did
mean
you
should
find
out
by
just
looking
at
me
then
you
must
look
so
i
can
he
smiled
but
what
is
it
chilton
hesitated
pursed
her
lips
then
picked
up
a
letter
near
her
i
read
it
to
you
she
said
it
from
a
miss
della
wetherby
at
ames
sanatorium
all
right
fire
away
directed
the
man
throwing
himself
at
full
length
on
to
the
couch
near
his
wife
chair
but
his
wife
did
not
at
once
fire
away
she
got
up
first
and
covered
her
husband
recumbent
figure
with
a
gray
worsted
afghan
chilton
wedding
day
was
but
a
year
behind
her
she
was
now
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
into
that
one
short
year
of
wifehood
she
had
tried
to
crowd
all
the
loving
service
and
babying
that
had
been
accumulating
through
twenty
years
of
lovelessness
and
loneliness
nor
did
the
doctor
who
had
been
on
his
wedding
day
and
who
could
remember
nothing
but
loneliness
and
lovelessness
on
his
part
object
in
the
least
to
this
concentrated
tending
he
acted
indeed
as
if
he
quite
enjoyed
it
though
he
was
careful
not
to
show
it
too
ardently
he
had
discovered
that
polly
had
for
so
long
been
miss
polly
that
she
was
inclined
to
retreat
in
a
panic
and
dub
her
ministrations
silly
if
they
were
received
with
too
much
notice
and
eagerness
so
he
contented
himself
now
with
a
mere
pat
of
her
hand
as
she
gave
the
afghan
a
final
smooth
and
settled
herself
to
read
the
letter
aloud
my
dear
chilton
della
wetherby
had
written
just
six
times
i
have
commenced
a
letter
to
you
and
torn
it
up
so
now
i
have
decided
not
to
at
all
but
just
to
tell
you
what
i
want
at
once
i
want
pollyanna
may
i
have
her
i
met
you
and
your
husband
last
march
when
you
came
on
to
take
pollyanna
home
but
i
presume
you
do
remember
me
i
am
asking
ames
who
does
know
me
very
well
to
write
your
husband
so
that
you
may
i
hope
not
fear
to
trust
your
dear
little
niece
to
us
i
understand
that
you
would
go
to
germany
with
your
husband
but
for
leaving
pollyanna
and
so
i
am
making
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
to
let
us
take
her
indeed
i
am
begging
you
to
let
us
have
her
dear
chilton
and
now
let
me
tell
you
why
my
sister
carew
is
a
lonely
discontented
unhappy
woman
she
lives
in
a
world
of
gloom
into
which
no
sunshine
penetrates
now
i
believe
that
if
anything
on
earth
can
bring
the
sunshine
into
her
life
it
is
your
niece
pollyanna
wo
you
let
her
try
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
she
has
done
for
the
sanatorium
here
but
nobody
could
tell
you
would
have
to
see
it
i
long
ago
discovered
that
you
ca
tell
about
pollyanna
the
minute
you
try
to
she
sounds
priggish
and
preachy
and
impossible
yet
you
and
i
know
she
is
anything
but
that
you
just
have
to
bring
pollyanna
on
to
the
scene
and
let
her
speak
for
herself
and
so
i
want
to
take
her
to
my
sister
and
let
her
speak
for
herself
she
would
attend
school
of
course
but
meanwhile
i
truly
believe
she
would
be
healing
the
wound
in
my
sister
heart
i
do
know
how
to
end
this
letter
i
believe
it
harder
than
it
was
to
begin
it
i
afraid
i
do
want
to
end
it
at
all
i
just
want
to
keep
talking
and
talking
for
fear
if
i
stop
it
give
you
a
chance
to
say
no
and
so
if
you
are
tempted
to
say
that
dreadful
word
wo
you
please
consider
that
that
i
still
talking
and
telling
you
how
much
we
want
and
need
pollyanna
hopefully
yours
della
wetherby
there
ejaculated
chilton
as
she
laid
the
letter
down
did
you
ever
read
such
a
remarkable
letter
or
hear
of
a
more
preposterous
absurd
request
well
i
not
so
sure
smiled
the
doctor
i
do
think
it
absurd
to
want
pollyanna
but
but
the
way
she
puts
it
healing
the
wound
in
her
heart
and
all
that
one
would
think
the
child
was
some
sort
of
of
medicine
the
doctor
laughed
outright
and
raised
his
eyebrows
well
i
not
so
sure
but
she
is
polly
i
always
said
i
wished
i
could
prescribe
her
and
buy
her
as
i
would
a
box
of
pills
and
charlie
ames
says
they
always
made
it
a
point
at
the
sanatorium
to
give
their
patients
a
dose
of
pollyanna
as
soon
as
possible
after
their
arrival
during
the
whole
year
she
was
there
indeed
scorned
chilton
then
you
do
think
you
let
her
go
go
why
of
course
not
do
you
think
i
let
that
child
go
to
perfect
strangers
like
that
and
such
strangers
why
thomas
i
should
expect
that
that
nurse
would
have
her
all
bottled
and
labeled
with
full
directions
on
the
outside
how
to
take
her
by
the
time
i
got
back
from
germany
again
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
heartily
but
only
for
a
moment
his
face
changed
perceptibly
as
he
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
letter
i
heard
from
ames
myself
this
morning
he
said
with
an
odd
something
in
his
voice
that
brought
a
puzzled
frown
to
his
brow
suppose
i
read
you
my
letter
now
dear
tom
he
began
miss
della
wetherby
has
asked
me
to
give
her
and
her
sister
a
which
i
am
very
glad
to
do
i
have
known
the
wetherby
girls
from
babyhood
they
come
from
a
fine
old
family
and
are
thoroughbred
gentlewomen
you
need
not
fear
on
that
score
there
were
three
sisters
doris
ruth
and
della
doris
married
a
man
named
john
kent
much
against
the
family
wishes
kent
came
from
good
stock
but
was
not
much
himself
i
guess
and
was
certainly
a
very
eccentric
disagreeable
man
to
deal
with
he
was
bitterly
angry
at
the
wetherbys
attitude
toward
him
and
there
was
little
communication
between
the
families
until
the
baby
came
the
wetherbys
worshiped
the
little
boy
james
as
they
called
him
doris
the
mother
died
when
the
boy
was
four
years
old
and
the
wetherbys
were
making
every
effort
to
get
the
father
to
give
the
child
entirely
up
to
them
when
suddenly
kent
disappeared
taking
the
boy
with
him
he
has
never
been
heard
from
since
though
a
search
has
been
made
the
loss
practically
killed
old
and
wetherby
they
both
died
soon
after
ruth
was
already
married
and
widowed
her
husband
was
a
man
named
carew
very
wealthy
and
much
older
than
herself
he
lived
but
a
year
or
so
after
marriage
and
left
her
with
a
young
son
who
also
died
within
a
year
from
the
time
little
jamie
disappeared
ruth
and
della
seemed
to
have
but
one
object
in
life
and
that
was
to
find
him
they
have
spent
money
like
water
and
have
all
but
moved
heaven
and
earth
but
without
avail
in
time
della
took
up
nursing
she
is
doing
splendid
work
and
has
become
the
cheerful
efficient
sane
woman
that
she
was
meant
to
be
though
still
never
forgetting
her
lost
nephew
and
never
leaving
unfollowed
any
possible
clew
that
might
lead
to
his
discovery
but
with
carew
it
is
quite
different
after
losing
her
own
boy
she
seemed
to
concentrate
all
her
thwarted
on
her
son
as
you
can
imagine
she
was
frantic
when
he
disappeared
that
was
eight
years
ago
for
her
eight
long
years
of
misery
gloom
and
bitterness
everything
that
money
can
buy
of
course
is
at
her
command
but
nothing
pleases
her
nothing
interests
her
della
feels
that
the
time
has
come
when
she
must
be
gotten
out
of
herself
at
all
hazards
and
della
believes
that
your
wife
sunny
little
niece
pollyanna
possesses
the
magic
key
that
will
unlock
the
door
to
a
new
existence
for
her
such
being
the
case
i
hope
you
will
see
your
way
clear
to
granting
her
request
and
may
i
add
that
i
too
personally
would
appreciate
the
favor
for
ruth
carew
and
her
sister
are
very
old
dear
friends
of
my
wife
and
myself
and
what
touches
them
touches
us
as
ever
yours
charlie
the
letter
finished
there
was
a
long
silence
so
long
a
silence
that
the
doctor
uttered
a
quiet
well
polly
still
there
was
silence
the
doctor
watching
his
wife
face
closely
saw
that
the
usually
firm
lips
and
chin
were
trembling
he
waited
then
quietly
until
his
wife
spoke
how
soon
do
you
think
they
expect
her
she
asked
at
last
in
spite
of
himself
chilton
gave
a
slight
start
you
mean
that
you
will
let
her
go
he
cried
his
wife
turned
indignantly
why
thomas
chilton
what
a
question
do
you
suppose
after
a
letter
like
that
i
could
do
anything
but
let
her
go
besides
did
ames
himself
ask
us
to
do
you
think
after
what
that
man
has
done
for
pollyanna
that
i
refuse
him
anything
no
matter
what
it
was
dear
dear
i
hope
now
that
the
doctor
wo
take
it
into
his
head
to
ask
for
for
you
my
love
murmured
the
with
a
whimsical
smile
but
his
wife
only
gave
him
a
deservedly
scornful
glance
and
said
you
may
write
ames
that
we
send
pollyanna
and
ask
him
to
tell
miss
wetherby
to
give
us
full
instructions
it
must
be
sometime
before
the
tenth
of
next
month
of
course
for
you
sail
then
and
i
want
to
see
the
child
properly
established
myself
before
i
leave
naturally
when
will
you
tell
pollyanna
probably
what
will
you
tell
her
i
do
know
exactly
but
not
any
more
than
i
ca
help
certainly
whatever
happens
thomas
we
do
want
to
spoil
pollyanna
and
no
child
could
help
being
spoiled
if
she
once
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
was
a
sort
of
of
of
medicine
bottle
with
a
label
of
full
instructions
for
taking
interpolated
the
doctor
with
a
smile
yes
sighed
chilton
it
her
unconsciousness
that
saves
the
whole
thing
you
know
that
dear
yes
i
know
nodded
the
man
she
knows
of
course
that
you
and
i
and
half
the
town
are
playing
the
game
with
her
and
that
we
we
are
wonderfully
happier
because
we
are
playing
it
chilton
voice
shook
a
little
then
went
on
more
steadily
but
if
consciously
she
should
begin
to
be
anything
but
her
own
natural
sunny
happy
little
self
playing
the
game
that
her
father
taught
her
she
would
be
just
what
that
nurse
said
she
sounded
like
so
whatever
i
tell
her
i
tell
her
that
she
going
down
to
carew
to
cheer
her
up
concluded
chilton
rising
to
her
feet
with
decision
and
putting
away
her
work
which
is
where
i
think
you
wise
approved
the
doctor
pollyanna
was
told
the
next
day
and
this
was
the
manner
of
it
my
dear
began
her
aunt
when
the
two
were
alone
together
that
morning
how
would
you
like
to
spend
next
winter
in
boston
with
you
no
i
have
decided
to
go
with
your
uncle
to
germany
but
carew
a
dear
friend
of
ames
has
asked
you
to
come
and
stay
with
her
for
the
winter
and
i
think
i
shall
let
you
go
pollyanna
face
fell
but
in
boston
i
wo
have
jimmy
or
pendleton
or
mrs
snow
or
anybody
that
i
know
aunt
polly
no
dear
but
you
did
have
them
when
you
came
here
till
you
found
them
pollyanna
gave
a
sudden
smile
why
aunt
polly
so
i
did
and
that
means
that
down
to
boston
there
are
some
jimmys
and
pendletons
and
snows
waiting
for
me
that
i
do
know
does
it
yes
dear
then
i
can
be
glad
of
that
i
believe
now
aunt
polly
you
know
how
to
play
the
game
better
than
i
do
i
never
thought
of
the
folks
down
there
waiting
for
me
to
know
them
and
there
such
a
lot
of
too
i
saw
some
of
them
when
i
was
there
two
years
ago
with
gray
we
were
there
two
whole
hours
you
know
on
my
way
here
from
out
west
there
was
a
man
in
the
station
a
perfectly
lovely
man
who
told
me
where
to
get
a
drink
of
water
do
you
suppose
he
there
now
i
like
to
know
him
and
there
was
a
nice
lady
with
a
little
girl
they
live
in
boston
they
said
they
did
the
little
girl
name
was
susie
smith
perhaps
i
could
get
to
know
them
do
you
suppose
i
could
and
there
was
a
boy
and
another
lady
with
a
baby
only
they
lived
in
honolulu
so
probably
i
could
find
them
there
now
but
there
be
carew
anyway
who
is
carew
aunt
polly
is
she
a
relation
dear
me
pollyanna
exclaimed
chilton
how
do
you
expect
anybody
to
keep
up
with
your
tongue
much
less
your
thoughts
when
they
skip
to
honolulu
and
back
again
in
two
seconds
no
carew
is
any
relation
to
us
miss
della
wetherby
sister
do
you
remember
miss
wetherby
at
the
sanatorium
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
her
sister
miss
wetherby
sister
oh
then
she
be
lovely
i
know
miss
wetherby
was
i
loved
miss
wetherby
she
had
little
all
around
her
eyes
and
mouth
and
she
knew
the
nicest
stories
i
only
had
her
two
months
though
because
she
only
got
there
a
little
while
before
i
came
away
at
first
i
was
sorry
that
i
had
her
all
the
time
but
afterwards
i
was
glad
for
you
see
if
i
had
had
her
all
the
time
it
would
have
been
harder
to
say
than
when
i
only
had
her
a
little
while
and
now
it
seem
as
if
i
had
her
again
i
going
to
have
her
sister
chilton
drew
in
her
breath
and
bit
her
lip
but
pollyanna
dear
you
must
not
expect
that
they
be
quite
alike
she
ventured
why
they
sisters
aunt
polly
argued
the
little
girl
her
eyes
widening
and
i
thought
sisters
were
always
alike
we
had
two
sets
of
in
the
ladies
aiders
one
set
was
twins
and
they
were
so
alike
you
could
tell
which
was
peck
and
which
was
jones
until
a
wart
grew
on
jones
nose
then
of
course
we
could
because
we
looked
for
the
wart
the
first
thing
and
that
what
i
told
her
one
day
when
she
was
complaining
that
people
called
her
peck
and
i
said
if
they
only
look
for
the
wart
as
i
did
they
know
right
off
but
she
acted
real
cross
i
mean
displeased
and
i
afraid
she
like
it
though
i
do
see
why
for
i
should
have
thought
she
been
glad
there
was
something
they
could
be
told
apart
by
as
she
was
the
president
and
did
like
it
when
folks
did
act
as
if
she
was
the
president
best
seats
and
introductions
and
special
attentions
at
church
suppers
you
know
but
she
did
and
afterwards
i
heard
white
tell
rawson
that
jones
had
done
everything
she
could
think
of
to
get
rid
of
that
wart
even
to
trying
to
put
salt
on
a
bird
tail
but
i
do
see
how
that
could
do
any
good
aunt
polly
does
putting
salt
on
a
bird
tail
help
the
warts
on
people
noses
of
course
not
child
how
you
do
run
on
pollyanna
especially
if
you
get
started
on
those
ladies
aiders
do
i
aunt
polly
asked
the
little
girl
ruefully
and
does
it
plague
you
i
do
mean
to
plague
you
honestly
aunt
polly
and
anyway
if
i
do
plague
you
about
those
ladies
aiders
you
can
be
kind
o
glad
for
if
i
thinking
of
the
aiders
i
sure
to
be
thinking
how
glad
i
am
that
i
do
belong
to
them
any
longer
but
have
got
an
aunt
all
my
own
you
can
be
glad
of
that
ca
you
aunt
polly
yes
yes
dear
of
course
i
can
of
course
i
can
laughed
chilton
rising
to
leave
the
room
and
feeling
suddenly
very
guilty
that
she
was
conscious
sometimes
of
a
little
of
her
old
irritation
against
pollyanna
perpetual
gladness
during
the
next
few
days
while
letters
concerning
pollyanna
winter
stay
in
boston
were
flying
back
and
forth
pollyanna
herself
was
preparing
for
that
stay
by
a
series
of
farewell
visits
to
her
beldingsville
friends
everybody
in
the
little
vermont
village
knew
pollyanna
now
and
almost
everybody
was
playing
the
game
with
her
the
few
who
were
not
were
not
refraining
because
of
ignorance
of
what
the
glad
game
was
so
to
one
house
after
another
pollyanna
carried
the
news
now
that
she
was
going
down
to
boston
to
spend
the
winter
and
loudly
rose
the
clamor
of
regret
and
remonstrance
all
the
way
from
nancy
in
aunt
polly
own
kitchen
to
the
great
house
on
the
hill
where
lived
john
pendleton
nancy
did
not
hesitate
to
say
to
every
one
except
her
mistress
that
she
considered
this
boston
trip
all
foolishness
and
that
for
her
part
she
would
have
been
glad
to
take
miss
pollyanna
home
with
her
to
the
corners
she
would
she
would
and
then
polly
could
have
gone
to
germany
all
she
wanted
to
on
the
hill
john
pendleton
said
practically
the
same
thing
only
he
did
not
hesitate
to
say
it
to
chilton
herself
as
for
jimmy
the
boy
whom
john
pendleton
had
taken
into
his
home
because
pollyanna
wanted
him
to
and
whom
he
had
now
adopted
because
he
wanted
to
himself
as
for
jimmy
jimmy
was
indignant
and
he
was
not
slow
to
show
it
but
you
just
come
he
reproached
pollyanna
in
the
tone
of
voice
a
small
boy
is
apt
to
use
when
he
wants
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
has
a
heart
why
i
been
here
ever
since
the
last
of
march
besides
it
as
if
i
was
going
to
stay
it
only
for
this
winter
i
do
care
you
just
been
away
for
a
whole
year
and
if
i
you
was
going
away
again
right
off
the
first
thing
i
would
have
helped
one
mite
to
meet
you
with
flags
and
bands
and
things
that
day
you
come
from
the
sanatorium
why
jimmy
bean
ejaculated
pollyanna
in
amazed
disapproval
then
with
a
touch
of
superiority
born
of
hurt
pride
she
observed
sure
i
did
ask
you
to
meet
me
with
bands
and
things
and
you
made
two
mistakes
in
that
sentence
you
should
say
was
and
i
think
come
is
wrong
it
does
sound
right
anyway
well
who
cares
if
i
did
pollyanna
eyes
grew
still
more
disapproving
you
said
you
did
when
you
asked
me
this
summer
to
tell
you
when
you
said
things
wrong
because
pendleton
was
trying
to
make
you
talk
right
well
if
you
been
brought
up
in
a
without
any
folks
that
cared
instead
of
by
a
whole
lot
of
old
women
who
did
have
anything
to
do
but
tell
you
how
to
talk
right
maybe
you
say
was
and
a
whole
lot
more
worse
things
pollyanna
whittier
why
jimmy
bean
flared
pollyanna
my
ladies
aiders
were
old
women
that
is
not
many
of
them
so
very
old
she
corrected
hastily
her
usual
proclivity
for
truth
and
literalness
superseding
her
anger
and
well
i
not
jimmy
bean
either
interrupted
the
boy
uptilting
his
chin
you
not
why
jimmy
be
what
do
you
mean
demanded
the
little
girl
i
been
adopted
legally
he
been
intending
to
do
it
all
along
he
says
only
he
did
get
to
it
now
he
done
it
i
to
be
called
pendleton
and
i
to
call
him
uncle
john
only
i
ai
are
not
i
mean
i
am
not
used
to
it
yet
so
i
hai
have
begun
to
call
him
that
much
the
boy
still
spoke
crossly
aggrievedly
but
every
trace
of
displeasure
had
fled
from
the
little
girl
face
at
his
words
she
clapped
her
hands
joyfully
oh
how
splendid
now
you
really
got
folks
folks
that
care
you
know
and
you
wo
ever
have
to
explain
that
he
was
born
your
folks
your
name
the
same
now
i
so
glad
glad
glad
the
boy
got
up
suddenly
from
the
stone
wall
where
they
had
been
sitting
and
walked
off
his
cheeks
felt
hot
and
his
eyes
smarted
with
tears
it
was
to
pollyanna
that
he
owed
it
all
this
great
good
that
had
come
to
him
and
he
knew
it
and
it
was
to
pollyanna
that
he
had
just
now
been
saying
he
kicked
a
small
stone
fiercely
then
another
and
another
he
thought
those
hot
tears
in
his
eyes
were
going
to
spill
over
and
roll
down
his
cheeks
in
spite
of
himself
he
kicked
another
stone
then
another
then
he
picked
up
a
third
stone
and
threw
it
with
all
his
might
a
minute
later
he
strolled
back
to
pollyanna
still
sitting
on
the
stone
wall
i
bet
you
i
can
hit
that
pine
tree
down
there
before
you
can
he
challenged
airily
bet
you
ca
cried
pollyanna
scrambling
down
from
her
perch
the
race
was
not
run
after
all
for
pollyanna
remembered
just
in
time
that
running
fast
was
yet
one
of
the
forbidden
luxuries
for
her
but
so
far
as
jimmy
was
concerned
it
did
not
matter
his
cheeks
were
no
longer
hot
his
eyes
were
not
threatening
to
overflow
with
tears
jimmy
was
himself
again
chapter
iii
a
dose
of
pollyanna
as
the
eighth
of
september
approached
the
day
pollyanna
was
to
arrive
ruth
carew
became
more
and
more
nervously
exasperated
with
herself
she
declared
that
she
had
regretted
just
once
her
promise
to
take
the
child
and
that
was
ever
since
she
had
given
it
before
hours
had
passed
she
had
indeed
written
to
her
sister
demanding
that
she
be
released
from
the
agreement
but
della
had
answered
that
it
was
quite
too
late
as
already
both
she
and
ames
had
written
the
chiltons
soon
after
that
had
come
della
letter
saying
that
chilton
had
given
her
consent
and
would
in
a
few
days
come
to
boston
to
make
arrangements
as
to
school
and
the
like
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
naturally
but
to
let
matters
take
their
course
carew
realized
that
and
submitted
to
the
inevitable
but
with
poor
grace
true
she
tried
to
be
decently
civil
when
della
and
chilton
made
their
expected
appearance
but
she
was
very
glad
that
limited
time
made
chilton
stay
of
very
short
duration
and
full
to
the
brim
of
business
it
was
well
indeed
perhaps
that
pollyanna
arrival
was
to
be
at
a
date
no
later
than
the
eighth
for
time
instead
of
reconciling
carew
to
the
prospective
new
member
of
her
household
was
filling
her
with
angry
impatience
at
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
her
absurd
yielding
to
della
crazy
scheme
nor
was
della
herself
in
the
least
unaware
of
her
sister
state
of
mind
if
outwardly
she
maintained
a
bold
front
inwardly
she
was
very
fearful
as
to
results
but
on
pollyanna
she
was
pinning
her
faith
and
because
she
did
pin
her
faith
on
pollyanna
she
determined
on
the
bold
stroke
of
leaving
the
little
girl
to
begin
her
fight
entirely
unaided
and
alone
she
contrived
therefore
that
carew
should
meet
them
at
the
station
upon
their
arrival
then
as
soon
as
greetings
and
introductions
were
over
she
hurriedly
pleaded
a
previous
engagement
and
took
herself
off
carew
therefore
had
scarcely
time
to
look
at
her
new
charge
before
she
found
herself
alone
with
the
child
oh
but
della
della
you
must
i
ca
she
called
agitatedly
after
the
retreating
figure
of
the
nurse
but
della
if
she
heard
did
not
heed
and
plainly
annoyed
and
vexed
carew
turned
back
to
the
child
at
her
side
what
a
shame
she
did
hear
did
she
pollyanna
was
saying
her
eyes
also
wistfully
following
the
nurse
and
i
did
want
her
to
go
now
a
bit
but
then
i
got
you
have
i
i
can
be
glad
for
that
oh
yes
you
got
me
and
i
got
you
returned
the
lady
not
very
graciously
come
we
go
this
way
she
directed
with
a
motion
toward
the
right
obediently
pollyanna
turned
and
trotted
at
carew
side
through
the
huge
station
but
she
looked
up
once
or
twice
rather
anxiously
into
the
lady
unsmiling
face
at
last
she
spoke
hesitatingly
i
expect
maybe
you
thought
i
be
pretty
she
hazarded
in
a
troubled
voice
p
pretty
repeated
carew
yes
with
curls
you
know
and
all
that
and
of
course
you
did
wonder
how
i
did
look
just
as
i
did
you
only
i
knew
you
be
pretty
and
nice
on
account
of
your
sister
i
had
her
to
go
by
and
you
have
anybody
and
of
course
i
not
pretty
on
account
of
the
freckles
and
it
is
nice
when
you
been
expecting
a
pretty
little
girl
to
have
one
come
like
me
and
nonsense
child
interrupted
carew
a
trifle
sharply
come
we
see
to
your
trunk
now
then
we
go
home
i
had
hoped
that
my
sister
would
come
with
us
but
it
seems
she
did
see
fit
even
for
this
one
night
pollyanna
smiled
and
nodded
i
know
but
she
could
probably
somebody
wanted
her
i
expect
somebody
was
always
wanting
her
at
the
sanatorium
it
a
bother
of
course
when
folks
do
want
you
all
the
time
is
it
you
ca
have
yourself
when
you
want
yourself
lots
of
times
still
you
can
be
kind
of
glad
for
that
for
it
is
nice
to
be
wanted
is
it
there
was
no
reply
perhaps
because
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
carew
was
wondering
if
anywhere
in
the
world
there
was
any
one
who
really
wanted
her
not
that
she
wished
to
be
wanted
of
course
she
told
herself
angrily
pulling
herself
up
with
a
jerk
and
frowning
down
at
the
child
by
her
side
pollyanna
did
not
see
the
frown
pollyanna
eyes
were
on
the
hurrying
throngs
about
them
my
what
a
lot
of
people
she
was
saying
happily
there
even
more
of
them
than
there
was
the
other
time
i
was
here
but
i
have
seen
anybody
yet
that
i
saw
then
though
i
looked
for
them
everywhere
of
course
the
lady
and
the
little
baby
lived
in
honolulu
so
probably
they
would
be
here
but
there
was
a
little
girl
susie
smith
she
lived
right
here
in
boston
maybe
you
know
her
though
do
you
know
susie
smith
no
i
do
know
susie
smith
replied
carew
dryly
do
you
she
awfully
nice
and
she
pretty
black
curls
you
know
the
kind
i
going
to
have
when
i
go
to
heaven
but
never
mind
maybe
i
can
find
her
for
you
so
you
will
know
her
oh
my
what
a
perfectly
lovely
automobile
and
are
we
going
to
ride
in
it
broke
off
pollyanna
as
they
came
to
a
pause
before
a
handsome
limousine
the
door
of
which
a
liveried
chauffeur
was
holding
open
illustration
my
what
a
perfectly
lovely
automobile
the
chauffeur
tried
to
hide
a
smile
and
failed
carew
however
answered
with
the
weariness
of
one
to
whom
rides
are
never
anything
but
a
means
of
locomotion
from
one
tiresome
place
to
another
probably
quite
as
tiresome
yes
we
going
to
ride
in
it
then
home
perkins
she
added
to
the
deferential
chauffeur
oh
my
is
it
yours
asked
pollyanna
detecting
the
unmistakable
air
of
ownership
in
her
hostess
manner
how
perfectly
lovely
then
you
must
be
rich
awfully
i
mean
exceedingly
rich
more
than
the
kind
that
just
has
carpets
in
every
room
and
ice
cream
sundays
like
the
whites
one
of
my
ladies
aiders
you
know
that
is
she
was
a
ladies
aider
i
used
to
think
they
were
rich
but
i
know
now
that
being
really
rich
means
you
got
diamond
rings
and
hired
girls
and
sealskin
coats
and
dresses
made
of
silk
and
velvet
for
every
day
and
an
automobile
have
you
got
all
those
why
i
suppose
i
have
admitted
carew
with
a
faint
smile
then
you
are
rich
of
course
nodded
pollyanna
wisely
my
aunt
polly
has
them
too
only
her
automobile
is
a
horse
my
but
do
i
just
love
to
ride
in
these
things
exulted
pollyanna
with
a
happy
little
bounce
you
see
i
never
did
before
except
the
one
that
ran
over
me
they
put
me
in
that
one
after
they
got
me
out
from
under
it
but
of
course
i
did
know
about
it
so
i
could
enjoy
it
since
then
i
have
been
in
one
at
all
aunt
polly
does
like
them
uncle
tom
does
though
and
he
wants
one
he
says
he
got
to
have
one
in
his
business
he
a
doctor
you
know
and
all
the
other
doctors
in
town
have
got
them
now
i
do
know
how
it
will
come
out
aunt
polly
is
all
stirred
up
over
it
you
see
she
wants
uncle
tom
to
have
what
he
wants
only
she
wants
him
to
want
what
she
wants
him
to
want
see
carew
laughed
suddenly
yes
my
dear
i
think
i
see
she
answered
demurely
though
her
eyes
still
carried
for
them
a
most
unusual
twinkle
all
right
sighed
pollyanna
contentedly
i
thought
you
would
still
it
did
sound
sort
of
mixed
when
i
said
it
oh
aunt
polly
says
she
would
mind
having
an
automobile
so
much
if
she
could
have
the
only
one
there
was
in
the
world
so
there
would
be
any
one
else
to
run
into
her
but
my
what
a
lot
of
houses
broke
off
pollyanna
looking
about
her
with
round
eyes
of
wonder
do
they
ever
stop
still
there
have
to
be
a
lot
of
them
for
all
those
folks
to
live
in
of
course
that
i
saw
at
the
station
besides
all
these
here
on
the
streets
and
of
course
where
there
are
more
folks
there
are
more
to
know
i
love
folks
do
you
love
folks
yes
just
folks
i
mean
anybody
everybody
well
no
pollyanna
i
ca
say
that
i
do
replied
carew
coldly
her
brows
contracted
carew
eyes
had
lost
their
twinkle
they
were
turned
rather
mistrustfully
indeed
on
pollyanna
to
herself
carew
was
saying
now
for
preachment
number
one
i
suppose
on
my
duty
to
mix
with
my
a
la
sister
della
do
you
oh
i
do
sighed
pollyanna
they
all
so
nice
and
so
different
you
know
and
down
here
there
must
be
such
a
lot
of
them
to
be
nice
and
different
oh
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
so
soon
that
i
came
i
knew
i
would
be
anyway
just
as
soon
as
i
found
out
you
were
you
that
is
miss
wetherby
sister
i
mean
i
love
miss
wetherby
so
i
knew
i
should
you
too
for
of
course
you
be
alike
sisters
so
even
if
you
were
twins
like
jones
and
peck
and
they
were
quite
alike
anyway
on
account
of
the
wart
but
i
reckon
you
do
know
what
i
mean
so
i
tell
you
and
thus
it
happened
that
carew
who
had
been
steeling
herself
for
a
preachment
on
social
ethics
found
herself
much
to
her
surprise
and
a
little
to
her
discomfiture
listening
to
the
story
of
a
wart
on
the
nose
of
one
peck
ladies
aider
by
the
time
the
story
was
finished
the
limousine
had
turned
into
commonwealth
avenue
and
pollyanna
immediately
began
to
exclaim
at
the
beauty
of
a
street
which
had
such
a
lovely
big
long
yard
all
the
way
up
and
down
through
the
middle
of
it
and
which
was
all
the
nicer
she
said
after
all
those
little
narrow
streets
only
i
should
think
every
one
would
want
to
live
on
it
she
commented
enthusiastically
very
likely
but
that
would
hardly
be
possible
retorted
carew
with
uplifted
eyebrows
pollyanna
mistaking
the
expression
on
her
face
for
one
of
dissatisfaction
that
her
own
home
was
not
on
the
beautiful
avenue
hastened
to
make
amends
why
no
of
course
not
she
agreed
and
i
did
mean
that
the
narrower
streets
were
just
as
nice
she
hurried
on
and
even
better
maybe
because
you
could
be
glad
you
did
have
to
go
so
far
when
you
wanted
to
run
across
the
way
to
borrow
eggs
or
soda
and
oh
but
do
you
live
here
she
interrupted
herself
as
the
car
came
to
a
stop
before
the
imposing
carew
doorway
do
you
live
here
mrs
carew
why
yes
of
course
i
live
here
returned
the
lady
with
just
a
touch
of
irritation
oh
how
glad
glad
you
must
be
to
live
in
such
a
perfectly
lovely
place
exulted
the
little
girl
springing
to
the
sidewalk
and
looking
eagerly
about
her
are
you
glad
carew
did
not
reply
with
unsmiling
lips
and
frowning
brow
she
was
stepping
from
the
limousine
for
the
second
time
in
five
minutes
pollyanna
hastened
to
make
amends
of
course
i
do
mean
the
kind
of
glad
that
sinfully
proud
she
explained
searching
carew
face
with
anxious
eyes
maybe
you
thought
i
did
same
as
aunt
polly
used
to
sometimes
i
do
mean
the
kind
that
glad
because
you
got
something
somebody
else
have
but
the
kind
that
just
just
makes
you
want
to
shout
and
yell
and
bang
doors
you
know
even
if
it
is
proper
she
finished
dancing
up
and
down
on
her
toes
the
chauffeur
turned
his
back
precipitately
and
busied
himself
with
the
car
carew
still
with
unsmiling
lips
and
frowning
brow
led
the
way
up
the
broad
stone
steps
come
pollyanna
was
all
she
said
crisply
it
was
five
days
later
that
della
wetherby
received
the
letter
from
her
sister
and
very
eagerly
she
tore
it
open
it
was
the
first
that
had
come
since
pollyanna
arrival
in
boston
my
dear
sister
carew
had
written
for
pity
sake
della
why
did
you
give
me
some
sort
of
an
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
child
you
have
insisted
upon
my
taking
i
nearly
wild
and
i
simply
send
her
away
i
tried
to
three
times
but
every
time
before
i
get
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
she
stops
them
by
telling
me
what
a
perfectly
lovely
time
she
is
having
and
how
glad
she
is
to
be
here
and
how
good
i
am
to
let
her
live
with
me
while
her
aunt
polly
has
gone
to
germany
now
how
pray
in
the
face
of
that
can
i
turn
around
and
say
wo
you
please
go
home
i
do
want
you
and
the
absurd
part
of
it
is
i
do
believe
it
has
ever
entered
her
head
that
i
do
want
her
here
and
i
ca
seem
to
make
it
enter
her
head
either
of
course
if
she
begins
to
preach
and
to
tell
me
to
count
my
blessings
i
shall
send
her
away
you
know
i
told
you
to
begin
with
that
i
would
permit
that
and
i
wo
two
or
three
times
i
have
thought
she
was
going
to
preach
i
mean
but
so
far
she
has
always
ended
up
with
some
ridiculous
story
about
those
ladies
aiders
of
hers
so
the
sermon
gets
sidetracked
luckily
for
her
if
she
wants
to
stay
but
really
della
she
is
impossible
listen
in
the
first
place
she
is
wild
with
delight
over
the
house
the
very
first
day
she
got
here
she
begged
me
to
open
every
room
and
she
was
not
satisfied
until
every
shade
in
the
house
was
up
so
that
she
might
all
the
perfectly
lovely
things
which
she
declared
were
even
nicer
than
john
pendleton
whoever
he
may
be
somebody
in
beldingsville
i
believe
anyhow
he
is
a
ladies
aider
i
found
out
that
much
then
as
if
it
was
enough
to
keep
me
running
from
room
to
room
as
if
i
were
the
guide
on
a
conducted
what
did
she
do
but
discover
a
white
satin
evening
gown
that
i
had
worn
for
years
and
beseech
me
to
put
it
on
and
i
did
put
it
on
why
i
ca
imagine
only
that
i
found
myself
utterly
helpless
in
her
hands
but
that
was
only
the
beginning
she
begged
then
to
see
everything
that
i
had
and
she
was
so
perfectly
funny
in
her
stories
of
the
missionary
barrels
which
she
used
to
out
of
that
i
had
to
laugh
though
i
almost
cried
too
to
think
of
the
wretched
things
that
poor
child
had
to
wear
of
course
gowns
led
to
jewels
and
she
made
such
a
fuss
over
my
two
or
three
rings
that
i
foolishly
opened
the
safe
just
to
see
her
eyes
pop
out
and
della
i
thought
that
child
would
go
crazy
she
put
on
to
me
every
ring
brooch
bracelet
and
necklace
that
i
owned
and
insisted
on
fastening
both
diamond
tiaras
in
my
hair
when
she
found
out
what
they
were
until
there
i
sat
hung
with
pearls
and
diamonds
and
emeralds
and
feeling
like
a
heathen
goddess
in
a
hindu
temple
especially
when
that
preposterous
child
began
to
dance
round
and
round
me
clapping
her
hands
and
chanting
how
perfectly
lovely
how
perfectly
lovely
how
i
would
love
to
hang
you
on
a
string
in
the
window
you
make
such
a
beautiful
prism
i
was
just
going
to
ask
her
what
on
earth
she
meant
by
that
when
down
she
dropped
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
began
to
cry
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
was
crying
for
because
she
was
so
glad
she
got
eyes
that
could
see
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
of
course
this
is
all
it
only
the
beginning
pollyanna
has
been
here
four
days
and
she
filled
every
one
of
them
full
she
already
numbers
among
her
friends
the
the
policeman
on
the
beat
and
the
paper
boy
to
say
nothing
of
every
servant
in
my
employ
they
seem
actually
bewitched
with
her
every
one
of
them
but
please
do
not
think
am
for
i
not
i
would
send
the
child
back
to
you
at
once
if
i
did
feel
obliged
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
keep
her
this
winter
as
for
her
making
me
forget
jamie
and
my
great
sorrow
that
is
impossible
she
only
makes
me
feel
my
loss
all
the
more
keenly
because
i
have
her
instead
of
him
but
as
i
said
i
shall
keep
her
until
she
begins
to
preach
then
back
she
goes
to
you
but
she
has
preached
yet
lovingly
but
distractedly
yours
ruth
preached
yet
indeed
chuckled
della
wetherby
to
herself
folding
up
the
sheets
of
her
sister
letter
oh
ruth
ruth
and
yet
you
admit
that
you
opened
every
room
raised
every
shade
decked
yourself
in
satin
and
jewels
and
pollyanna
been
there
a
week
yet
but
she
has
preached
oh
no
she
preached
chapter
iv
the
game
and
carew
boston
to
pollyanna
was
a
new
experience
and
certainly
pollyanna
to
boston
such
part
of
it
as
was
privileged
to
know
her
was
very
much
of
a
new
experience
pollyanna
said
she
liked
boston
but
that
she
did
wish
it
was
not
quite
so
big
you
see
she
explained
earnestly
to
carew
the
day
following
her
arrival
i
want
to
see
and
know
it
all
and
i
ca
it
just
like
aunt
polly
company
dinners
there
so
much
to
eat
i
mean
to
see
that
you
do
eat
i
mean
see
anything
because
you
always
trying
to
decide
what
to
eat
i
mean
to
see
of
course
you
can
be
glad
there
is
such
a
lot
resumed
pollyanna
after
taking
breath
a
whole
lot
of
anything
is
nice
that
is
good
things
not
such
things
as
medicine
and
funerals
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
used
to
help
wishing
aunt
polly
company
dinners
could
be
spread
out
a
little
over
the
days
when
there
any
cake
and
pie
and
i
feel
the
same
way
about
boston
i
wish
i
could
take
part
of
it
home
with
me
up
to
beldingsville
so
i
have
something
new
next
summer
but
of
course
i
ca
cities
are
like
frosted
cake
and
anyhow
even
the
cake
did
keep
very
well
i
tried
it
and
it
dried
up
the
frosting
i
reckon
the
time
to
take
frosting
and
good
times
is
while
they
are
going
so
i
want
to
see
all
i
can
now
while
i
here
pollyanna
unlike
the
people
who
think
that
to
see
the
world
one
must
begin
at
the
most
distant
point
began
her
seeing
boston
by
a
thorough
exploration
of
her
immediate
surroundings
the
beautiful
commonwealth
avenue
residence
which
was
now
her
home
this
with
her
school
work
fully
occupied
her
time
and
attention
for
some
days
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
so
much
to
learn
and
everything
was
so
marvelous
and
so
beautiful
from
the
tiny
buttons
in
the
wall
that
flooded
the
rooms
with
light
to
the
great
silent
ballroom
hung
with
mirrors
and
pictures
there
were
so
many
delightful
people
to
know
too
for
besides
carew
herself
there
were
mary
who
dusted
the
answered
the
bell
and
accompanied
pollyanna
to
and
from
school
each
day
bridget
who
lived
in
the
kitchen
and
cooked
jennie
who
waited
at
table
and
perkins
who
drove
the
automobile
and
they
were
all
so
delightful
yet
so
different
pollyanna
had
arrived
on
a
monday
so
it
was
almost
a
week
before
the
first
sunday
she
came
downstairs
that
morning
with
a
beaming
countenance
i
love
sundays
she
sighed
happily
do
you
carew
voice
had
the
weariness
of
one
who
loves
no
day
yes
on
account
of
church
you
know
and
sunday
school
which
do
you
like
best
church
or
sunday
school
well
really
i
began
carew
who
seldom
went
to
church
and
never
went
to
sunday
school
is
hard
to
tell
is
it
interposed
pollyanna
with
luminous
but
serious
eyes
but
you
see
like
church
best
on
account
of
father
you
know
he
was
a
minister
and
of
course
he
really
up
in
heaven
with
mother
and
the
rest
of
us
but
i
try
to
imagine
him
down
here
lots
of
times
and
it
easiest
in
church
when
the
minister
is
talking
i
shut
my
eyes
and
imagine
it
father
up
there
and
it
helps
lots
i
so
glad
we
can
imagine
things
are
you
i
not
so
sure
of
that
pollyanna
oh
but
just
think
how
much
nicer
our
imagined
things
are
than
our
really
truly
ones
that
is
of
course
yours
are
because
your
real
ones
are
so
nice
carew
angrily
started
to
speak
but
pollyanna
was
hurrying
on
and
of
course
my
real
ones
are
ever
so
much
nicer
than
they
used
to
be
but
all
that
time
i
was
hurt
when
my
legs
did
go
i
just
had
to
keep
imagining
all
the
time
just
as
hard
as
i
could
and
of
course
now
there
are
lots
of
times
when
i
do
it
like
about
father
and
all
that
and
so
i
just
going
to
imagine
it
father
up
there
in
the
pulpit
what
time
do
we
go
go
to
church
i
mean
but
pollyanna
i
do
that
is
i
rather
not
carew
cleared
her
throat
and
tried
again
to
say
that
she
was
not
going
to
church
at
all
that
she
almost
never
went
but
with
confident
little
face
and
happy
eyes
before
her
she
could
not
do
it
why
i
suppose
about
quarter
past
ten
if
we
walk
she
said
then
almost
crossly
it
only
a
little
way
thus
it
happened
that
carew
on
that
bright
september
morning
occupied
for
the
first
time
in
months
the
carew
pew
in
the
very
fashionable
and
elegant
church
to
which
she
had
gone
as
a
girl
and
which
she
still
supported
liberally
so
far
as
money
went
to
pollyanna
that
sunday
morning
service
was
a
great
wonder
and
joy
the
marvelous
music
of
the
vested
choir
the
opalescent
rays
from
the
jeweled
windows
the
impassioned
voice
of
the
preacher
and
the
reverent
hush
of
the
worshiping
throng
filled
her
with
an
ecstasy
that
left
her
for
a
time
almost
speechless
not
until
they
were
nearly
home
did
she
fervently
breathe
oh
carew
i
just
been
thinking
how
glad
i
am
we
do
have
to
live
but
just
one
day
at
a
time
carew
frowned
and
looked
down
sharply
carew
was
in
no
mood
for
preaching
she
had
just
been
obliged
to
endure
it
from
the
pulpit
she
told
herself
angrily
and
she
would
not
listen
to
it
from
this
chit
of
a
child
moreover
this
living
one
day
at
a
time
theory
was
a
particularly
pet
doctrine
of
della
was
not
della
always
saying
but
you
only
have
to
live
one
minute
at
a
time
ruth
and
any
one
can
endure
anything
for
one
minute
at
a
time
well
said
carew
now
tersely
yes
only
think
what
i
do
if
i
had
to
live
yesterday
and
and
all
at
once
sighed
pollyanna
such
a
lot
of
perfectly
lovely
things
you
know
but
i
had
yesterday
and
now
i
living
and
i
got
still
coming
and
next
sunday
too
honestly
carew
if
it
was
sunday
now
and
on
this
nice
quiet
street
i
should
just
dance
and
shout
and
yell
i
could
help
it
but
it
being
sunday
so
i
shall
have
to
wait
till
i
get
home
and
then
take
a
hymn
the
most
rejoicingest
hymn
i
can
think
of
what
is
the
most
rejoicingest
hymn
do
you
know
mrs
carew
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
answered
carew
faintly
looking
very
much
as
if
she
were
searching
for
something
she
had
lost
for
a
woman
who
expects
because
things
are
so
bad
to
be
told
that
she
need
stand
only
one
day
at
a
time
it
is
disarming
to
say
the
least
to
be
told
that
because
things
are
so
good
it
is
lucky
she
does
not
have
to
stand
but
one
day
at
a
time
on
monday
the
next
morning
pollyanna
went
to
school
for
the
first
time
alone
she
knew
the
way
perfectly
now
and
it
was
only
a
short
walk
pollyanna
enjoyed
her
school
very
much
it
was
a
small
private
school
for
girls
and
was
quite
a
new
experience
in
its
way
but
pollyanna
liked
new
experiences
carew
however
did
not
like
new
experiences
and
she
was
having
a
good
many
of
them
these
days
for
one
who
is
tired
of
everything
to
be
in
so
intimate
a
companionship
with
one
to
whom
everything
is
a
fresh
and
fascinating
joy
must
needs
result
in
annoyance
to
say
the
least
and
carew
was
more
than
annoyed
she
was
exasperated
yet
to
herself
she
was
forced
to
admit
that
if
any
one
asked
her
why
she
was
exasperated
the
only
reason
she
could
give
would
be
because
pollyanna
is
so
glad
and
even
carew
would
hardly
like
to
give
an
answer
like
that
to
della
however
carew
did
write
that
the
word
glad
had
got
on
her
nerves
and
that
sometimes
she
wished
she
might
never
hear
it
again
she
still
admitted
that
pollyanna
had
not
preached
that
she
had
not
even
once
tried
to
make
her
play
the
game
what
the
child
did
do
however
was
invariably
to
take
carew
gladness
as
a
matter
of
course
which
to
one
who
had
no
gladness
was
most
provoking
it
was
during
the
second
week
of
pollyanna
stay
that
annoyance
overflowed
into
irritable
remonstrance
the
immediate
cause
thereof
was
pollyanna
glowing
conclusion
to
a
story
about
one
of
her
ladies
aiders
she
was
playing
the
game
carew
but
maybe
you
do
know
what
the
game
is
i
tell
you
it
a
lovely
game
but
carew
held
up
her
hand
never
mind
pollyanna
she
demurred
i
know
all
about
the
game
my
sister
told
me
and
and
i
must
say
that
i
i
should
not
care
for
it
why
of
course
not
mrs
carew
exclaimed
pollyanna
in
quick
apology
i
did
mean
the
game
for
you
you
could
play
it
of
course
i
could
play
it
ejaculated
carew
who
though
she
would
not
play
this
silly
game
was
in
no
mood
to
be
told
that
she
could
not
why
no
do
you
see
laughed
pollyanna
gleefully
the
game
is
to
find
something
in
everything
to
be
glad
about
and
you
even
begin
to
hunt
for
there
is
anything
about
you
but
what
you
could
be
glad
about
there
would
be
any
game
to
it
for
you
you
see
carew
flushed
angrily
in
her
annoyance
she
said
more
than
perhaps
she
meant
to
say
well
no
pollyanna
i
ca
say
that
i
do
she
differed
coldly
as
it
happens
you
see
i
can
find
nothing
whatever
to
be
glad
for
for
a
moment
pollyanna
stared
blankly
then
she
fell
back
in
amazement
why
mrs
carew
she
breathed
well
what
is
there
for
me
challenged
the
woman
forgetting
all
about
for
the
moment
that
she
was
never
going
to
allow
pollyanna
to
preach
why
there
there
everything
murmured
pollyanna
still
with
that
dazed
unbelief
there
there
this
beautiful
house
it
just
a
place
to
eat
and
sleep
and
i
do
want
to
eat
and
sleep
but
there
are
all
these
perfectly
lovely
things
faltered
pollyanna
i
tired
of
them
and
your
automobile
that
will
take
you
anywhere
i
do
want
to
go
anywhere
pollyanna
quite
gasped
aloud
but
think
of
the
people
and
things
you
could
see
mrs
carew
they
would
not
interest
me
pollyanna
once
again
pollyanna
stared
in
amazement
the
troubled
frown
on
her
face
deepened
but
carew
i
do
see
she
urged
always
before
there
have
been
bad
things
for
folks
to
play
the
game
on
and
the
badder
they
are
the
more
fun
is
to
get
them
out
find
the
things
to
be
glad
for
i
mean
but
where
there
are
any
bad
things
i
should
know
how
to
play
the
game
myself
there
was
no
answer
for
a
time
carew
sat
with
her
eyes
out
the
window
gradually
the
angry
rebellion
on
her
face
changed
to
a
look
of
hopeless
sadness
very
slowly
then
she
turned
and
said
pollyanna
i
had
thought
i
would
tell
you
this
but
i
decided
that
i
will
i
going
to
tell
you
why
nothing
that
i
have
can
make
me
glad
and
she
began
the
story
of
jamie
the
little
boy
who
eight
long
years
before
had
stepped
as
into
another
world
leaving
the
door
fast
shut
between
and
you
never
seen
him
since
anywhere
faltered
pollyanna
with
eyes
when
the
story
was
done
never
but
we
find
him
carew
i
sure
we
find
him
carew
shook
her
head
sadly
but
i
ca
i
looked
everywhere
even
in
foreign
lands
but
he
must
be
somewhere
he
may
be
dead
pollyanna
pollyanna
gave
a
quick
cry
oh
no
carew
please
do
say
that
let
imagine
he
alive
we
can
do
that
and
that
help
and
when
we
get
him
imagined
alive
we
can
just
as
well
imagine
we
going
to
find
him
and
that
help
a
whole
lot
more
but
i
afraid
he
dead
pollyanna
choked
carew
you
do
know
it
for
sure
do
you
besought
the
little
girl
anxiously
well
then
you
just
imagining
it
maintained
pollyanna
in
triumph
and
if
you
can
imagine
him
dead
you
can
just
as
well
imagine
him
alive
and
it
be
a
whole
lot
nicer
while
you
doing
it
do
you
see
and
some
day
i
just
sure
you
find
him
why
carew
you
can
play
the
game
now
you
can
play
it
on
jamie
you
can
be
glad
every
day
for
every
day
brings
you
just
one
day
nearer
to
the
time
when
you
going
to
find
him
see
but
carew
did
not
see
she
rose
drearily
to
her
feet
and
said
no
no
child
you
do
understand
you
do
understand
now
run
away
please
and
read
or
do
anything
you
like
my
head
aches
going
to
lie
down
and
pollyanna
with
a
troubled
sober
face
slowly
left
the
room
chapter
v
pollyanna
takes
a
walk
it
was
on
the
second
saturday
afternoon
that
pollyanna
took
her
memorable
walk
heretofore
pollyanna
had
not
walked
out
alone
except
to
go
to
and
from
school
that
she
would
ever
attempt
to
explore
boston
streets
by
herself
never
occurred
to
carew
hence
she
naturally
had
never
forbidden
it
in
beldingsville
however
pollyanna
had
found
especially
at
the
first
her
chief
diversion
in
strolling
about
the
rambling
old
village
streets
in
search
of
new
friends
and
new
adventures
on
this
particular
saturday
afternoon
carew
had
said
as
she
often
did
say
there
there
child
run
away
please
do
go
where
you
like
and
do
what
you
like
only
do
please
ask
me
any
more
questions
until
now
left
to
herself
pollyanna
had
always
found
plenty
to
interest
her
within
the
four
walls
of
the
house
for
if
inanimate
things
failed
there
were
yet
mary
jennie
bridget
and
perkins
however
mary
had
a
headache
jennie
was
trimming
a
new
hat
bridget
was
making
apple
pies
and
perkins
was
nowhere
to
be
found
moreover
it
was
a
particularly
beautiful
september
day
and
nothing
within
the
house
was
so
alluring
as
the
bright
sunlight
and
balmy
air
outside
so
outside
pollyanna
went
and
dropped
herself
down
on
the
steps
for
some
time
she
watched
in
silence
the
men
women
and
children
who
walked
briskly
by
the
house
or
else
sauntered
more
leisurely
through
the
parkway
that
extended
up
and
down
the
middle
of
the
avenue
then
she
got
to
her
feet
skipped
down
the
steps
and
stood
looking
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
pollyanna
had
decided
that
she
too
would
take
a
walk
it
was
a
beautiful
day
for
a
walk
and
not
once
yet
had
she
taken
one
at
all
not
a
real
walk
just
going
to
and
from
school
did
not
count
so
she
would
take
one
carew
would
not
mind
had
she
not
told
her
to
do
just
what
she
pleased
so
long
as
she
asked
no
more
questions
and
there
was
the
whole
long
afternoon
before
her
only
think
what
a
lot
one
might
see
in
a
whole
long
afternoon
and
it
really
was
such
a
beautiful
day
she
would
go
this
way
and
with
a
little
whirl
and
skip
of
pure
joy
pollyanna
turned
and
walked
blithely
down
the
avenue
into
the
eyes
of
those
she
met
pollyanna
smiled
joyously
she
was
disappointed
but
not
surprised
that
she
received
no
answering
smile
in
return
she
was
used
to
that
now
in
boston
she
still
smiled
however
hopefully
there
might
be
some
one
sometime
who
would
smile
back
carew
home
was
very
near
the
beginning
of
commonwealth
avenue
so
it
was
not
long
before
pollyanna
found
herself
at
the
edge
of
a
street
crossing
her
way
at
right
angles
across
the
street
in
all
its
autumn
glory
lay
what
to
pollyanna
was
the
most
beautiful
yard
she
had
ever
seen
the
boston
public
garden
for
a
moment
pollyanna
hesitated
her
eyes
longingly
fixed
on
the
wealth
of
beauty
before
her
that
it
was
the
private
grounds
of
some
rich
man
or
woman
she
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
once
with
ames
at
the
sanatorium
she
had
been
taken
to
call
on
a
lady
who
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
surrounded
by
just
such
walks
and
trees
and
as
these
pollyanna
wanted
now
very
much
to
cross
the
street
and
walk
in
those
grounds
but
she
doubted
if
she
had
the
right
to
be
sure
others
were
there
moving
about
she
could
see
but
they
might
be
invited
guests
of
course
after
she
had
seen
two
women
one
man
and
a
little
girl
unhesitatingly
enter
the
gate
and
walk
briskly
down
the
path
however
pollyanna
concluded
that
she
too
might
go
watching
her
chance
she
skipped
nimbly
across
the
street
and
entered
the
garden
it
was
even
more
beautiful
close
at
hand
than
it
had
been
at
a
distance
birds
twittered
over
her
head
and
a
squirrel
leaped
across
the
path
ahead
of
her
on
benches
here
and
there
sat
men
women
and
children
through
the
trees
flashed
the
sparkle
of
the
sun
on
water
and
from
somewhere
came
the
shouts
of
children
and
the
sound
of
music
once
again
pollyanna
hesitated
then
a
little
timidly
she
accosted
a
young
woman
coming
toward
her
please
is
this
a
party
she
asked
the
young
woman
stared
a
party
she
repeated
dazedly
yes
i
mean
is
it
all
right
for
me
to
be
here
for
you
to
be
here
why
of
course
it
for
for
everybody
exclaimed
the
young
woman
oh
that
all
right
then
i
glad
i
came
beamed
pollyanna
the
young
woman
said
nothing
but
she
turned
back
and
looked
at
pollyanna
still
dazedly
as
she
hurried
away
pollyanna
not
at
all
surprised
that
the
owner
of
this
beautiful
place
should
be
so
generous
as
to
give
a
party
to
everybody
continued
on
her
way
at
the
turn
of
the
path
she
came
upon
a
small
girl
and
a
doll
carriage
she
stopped
with
a
glad
little
cry
but
she
had
not
said
a
dozen
words
before
from
somewhere
came
a
young
woman
with
hurrying
steps
and
a
disapproving
voice
a
young
woman
who
held
out
her
hand
to
the
small
girl
and
said
sharply
here
gladys
gladys
come
away
with
me
has
mama
told
you
not
to
talk
to
strange
children
but
i
not
strange
children
explained
pollyanna
in
eager
defense
i
live
right
here
in
boston
now
and
but
the
young
woman
and
the
little
girl
dragging
the
doll
carriage
were
already
far
down
the
path
and
with
a
sigh
pollyanna
fell
back
for
a
moment
she
stood
silent
plainly
disappointed
then
resolutely
she
lifted
her
chin
and
went
forward
well
anyhow
i
can
be
glad
for
that
she
nodded
to
herself
for
now
maybe
i
find
somebody
even
nicer
susie
smith
perhaps
or
even
carew
jamie
anyhow
i
can
imagine
i
going
to
find
them
and
if
i
do
find
them
i
can
find
somebody
she
finished
her
wistful
eyes
on
the
people
all
about
her
undeniably
pollyanna
was
lonesome
brought
up
by
her
father
and
the
ladies
aid
society
in
a
small
western
town
she
had
counted
every
house
in
the
village
her
home
and
every
man
woman
and
child
her
friend
coming
to
her
aunt
in
vermont
at
eleven
years
of
age
she
had
promptly
assumed
that
conditions
would
differ
only
in
that
the
homes
and
the
friends
would
be
new
and
therefore
even
more
delightful
possibly
for
they
would
be
different
and
pollyanna
did
so
love
different
things
and
people
her
first
and
always
her
supreme
delight
in
beldingsville
therefore
had
been
her
long
rambles
about
the
town
and
the
charming
visits
with
the
new
friends
she
had
made
quite
naturally
in
consequence
boston
as
she
first
saw
it
seemed
to
pollyanna
even
more
delightfully
promising
in
its
possibilities
thus
far
however
pollyanna
had
to
admit
that
in
one
respect
at
least
it
had
been
disappointing
she
had
been
here
nearly
two
weeks
and
she
did
not
yet
know
the
people
who
lived
across
the
street
or
even
next
door
more
inexplicable
still
carew
herself
did
not
know
many
of
them
and
not
any
of
them
well
she
seemed
indeed
utterly
indifferent
to
her
neighbors
which
was
most
amazing
from
pollyanna
point
of
view
but
nothing
she
could
say
appeared
to
change
carew
attitude
in
the
matter
at
all
they
do
not
interest
me
pollyanna
was
all
she
would
say
and
with
this
pollyanna
whom
they
did
interest
very
much
was
forced
to
be
content
on
her
walk
however
pollyanna
had
started
out
with
high
hopes
yet
thus
far
she
seemed
destined
to
be
disappointed
here
all
about
her
were
people
who
were
doubtless
most
delightful
if
she
only
knew
them
but
she
did
not
know
them
worse
yet
there
seemed
to
be
no
prospect
that
she
would
know
them
for
they
did
not
apparently
wish
to
know
her
pollyanna
was
still
smarting
under
the
nurse
sharp
warning
concerning
strange
children
well
i
reckon
i
just
have
to
show
that
i
not
strange
children
she
said
at
last
to
herself
moving
confidently
forward
again
pursuant
of
this
idea
pollyanna
smiled
sweetly
into
the
eyes
of
the
next
person
she
met
and
said
blithely
it
a
nice
day
is
it
er
what
oh
it
is
murmured
the
lady
addressed
as
she
hastened
on
a
little
faster
twice
again
pollyanna
tried
the
same
experiment
but
with
like
disappointing
results
soon
she
came
upon
the
little
pond
that
she
had
seen
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
through
the
trees
it
was
a
beautiful
pond
and
on
it
were
several
pretty
little
boats
full
of
laughing
children
as
she
watched
them
pollyanna
felt
more
and
more
dissatisfied
to
remain
by
herself
it
was
then
that
spying
a
man
sitting
alone
not
far
away
she
advanced
slowly
toward
him
and
sat
down
on
the
other
end
of
the
bench
once
pollyanna
would
have
danced
unhesitatingly
to
the
man
side
and
suggested
acquaintanceship
with
a
cheery
confidence
that
had
no
doubt
of
a
welcome
but
recent
rebuffs
had
filled
her
with
unaccustomed
diffidence
covertly
she
looked
at
the
man
now
he
was
not
very
good
to
look
at
his
garments
though
new
were
dusty
and
plainly
showed
lack
of
care
they
were
of
the
cut
and
style
though
pollyanna
of
course
did
not
know
this
that
the
state
gives
its
prisoners
as
a
freedom
suit
his
face
was
a
pasty
white
and
was
adorned
with
a
week
beard
his
hat
was
pulled
far
down
over
his
eyes
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
sat
idly
staring
at
the
ground
for
a
long
minute
pollyanna
said
nothing
then
hopefully
she
began
it
is
a
nice
day
is
it
the
man
turned
his
head
with
a
start
eh
oh
er
what
did
you
say
he
questioned
with
a
curiously
frightened
look
around
to
make
sure
the
remark
was
addressed
to
him
i
said
was
a
nice
day
explained
pollyanna
in
hurried
earnestness
but
i
do
care
about
that
especially
that
is
of
course
i
glad
it
a
nice
day
but
i
said
it
just
as
a
beginning
to
things
and
just
as
soon
talk
about
something
else
anything
else
it
only
that
i
wanted
you
to
talk
about
something
you
see
the
man
gave
a
low
laugh
even
to
pollyanna
the
laugh
sounded
a
little
queer
though
she
did
not
know
as
did
the
man
that
a
laugh
to
his
lips
had
been
a
stranger
for
many
months
so
you
want
me
to
talk
do
you
he
said
a
little
sadly
well
i
do
see
but
what
i
shall
have
to
do
it
then
still
i
should
think
a
nice
little
lady
like
you
might
find
lots
nicer
people
to
talk
to
than
an
old
duffer
like
me
oh
but
i
like
old
duffers
exclaimed
pollyanna
quickly
that
is
i
like
the
old
part
and
i
do
know
what
a
duffer
is
so
i
dislike
that
besides
if
you
are
a
duffer
i
reckon
i
like
duffers
anyhow
i
like
you
she
finished
with
a
contented
little
settling
of
herself
in
her
seat
that
carried
conviction
humph
well
i
sure
i
flattered
smiled
the
man
ironically
though
his
face
and
words
expressed
polite
doubt
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
he
sat
a
little
straighter
on
the
bench
and
pray
what
shall
we
talk
about
it
it
infinitesimal
to
me
that
means
i
do
care
does
it
asked
pollyanna
with
a
beaming
smile
aunt
polly
says
that
whatever
i
talk
about
anyhow
i
always
bring
up
at
the
ladies
aiders
but
i
reckon
that
because
they
brought
me
up
first
do
you
we
might
talk
about
the
party
i
think
it
a
perfectly
beautiful
party
now
that
i
know
some
one
yes
this
you
know
all
these
people
here
it
is
a
party
is
it
the
lady
said
it
was
for
everybody
so
i
stayed
though
i
have
got
to
where
the
house
is
yet
that
giving
the
party
the
man
lips
twitched
well
little
lady
perhaps
it
is
a
party
in
a
way
he
smiled
but
the
that
giving
it
is
the
city
of
boston
this
is
the
public
garden
a
public
park
you
understand
for
everybody
is
it
always
and
i
may
come
here
any
time
i
want
to
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
that
even
nicer
than
i
thought
it
could
be
worried
for
fear
i
could
ever
come
again
after
you
see
i
glad
now
though
that
i
did
know
it
just
at
the
first
for
it
all
the
nicer
now
nice
things
are
nicer
when
you
been
worrying
for
fear
they
wo
be
nice
are
they
perhaps
they
are
if
they
ever
turn
out
to
be
nice
at
all
conceded
the
man
a
little
gloomily
yes
i
think
so
nodded
pollyanna
not
noticing
the
gloom
but
is
it
beautiful
here
she
gloried
i
wonder
if
carew
knows
about
it
that
it
for
anybody
so
why
i
should
think
everybody
would
want
to
come
here
all
the
time
and
just
stay
and
look
around
the
man
face
hardened
well
there
are
a
few
people
in
the
world
who
have
got
a
job
got
something
to
do
besides
just
to
come
here
and
stay
and
look
around
but
i
do
happen
to
be
one
of
them
do
you
then
you
can
be
glad
for
that
ca
you
sighed
pollyanna
her
eyes
delightedly
following
a
passing
boat
the
man
lips
parted
indignantly
but
no
words
came
pollyanna
was
still
talking
i
wish
did
have
anything
to
do
but
that
i
have
to
go
to
school
oh
i
like
school
but
there
such
a
whole
lot
of
things
i
like
better
still
i
glad
i
can
go
to
school
i
glad
when
i
remember
how
last
winter
i
did
think
i
could
ever
go
again
you
see
i
lost
my
legs
for
a
while
i
mean
they
did
go
and
you
know
you
never
know
how
much
you
use
things
till
you
do
have
and
eyes
too
did
you
ever
think
what
a
lot
you
do
with
eyes
i
did
till
i
went
to
the
sanatorium
there
was
a
lady
there
who
had
just
got
blind
the
year
before
i
tried
to
get
her
to
play
the
game
finding
something
to
be
glad
about
you
know
but
she
said
she
could
and
if
i
wanted
to
know
why
i
might
tie
up
my
eyes
with
my
handkerchief
for
just
one
hour
and
i
did
it
was
awful
did
you
ever
try
it
why
i
did
a
expression
was
coming
to
the
man
face
well
do
it
awful
you
ca
do
anything
not
anything
that
you
want
to
do
but
i
kept
it
on
the
whole
hour
since
then
i
been
so
glad
sometimes
when
i
see
something
perfectly
lovely
like
this
you
know
i
been
so
glad
i
wanted
to
cry
i
could
see
it
you
know
she
playing
the
game
now
though
that
blind
lady
is
miss
wetherby
told
me
the
game
yes
the
glad
game
did
i
tell
you
finding
something
in
everything
to
be
glad
about
well
she
found
it
now
about
her
eyes
you
know
her
husband
is
the
kind
of
a
man
that
goes
to
help
make
the
laws
and
she
had
him
ask
for
one
that
would
help
blind
people
little
babies
and
she
went
herself
and
talked
and
told
those
men
how
it
felt
to
be
blind
and
they
made
it
that
law
and
they
said
that
she
did
more
than
anybody
else
even
her
husband
to
help
make
it
and
that
they
did
believe
there
would
have
been
any
law
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
her
so
now
she
says
she
glad
she
lost
her
eyes
she
kept
so
many
little
babies
from
growing
up
to
be
blind
like
her
so
you
see
she
playing
it
the
game
but
i
reckon
you
do
know
about
the
game
yet
after
all
so
i
tell
you
it
started
this
way
and
pollyanna
with
her
eyes
on
the
shimmering
beauty
all
about
her
told
of
the
little
pair
of
crutches
of
long
ago
which
should
have
been
a
doll
when
the
story
was
finished
there
was
a
long
silence
then
a
little
abruptly
the
man
got
to
his
feet
oh
are
you
going
away
now
she
asked
in
open
disappointment
yes
i
going
now
he
smiled
down
at
her
a
little
queerly
but
you
coming
back
sometime
he
shook
his
head
but
again
he
smiled
i
hope
not
and
i
believe
not
little
girl
you
see
i
made
a
great
discovery
i
thought
i
was
down
and
out
i
thought
there
was
no
place
for
me
anywhere
now
but
i
just
discovered
that
got
two
eyes
two
arms
and
two
legs
now
i
going
to
use
them
and
i
going
to
make
somebody
understand
that
i
know
how
to
use
them
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
why
what
a
funny
man
mused
pollyanna
still
he
was
nice
and
he
was
different
too
she
finished
rising
to
her
feet
and
resuming
her
walk
pollyanna
was
now
once
more
her
usual
cheerful
self
and
she
stepped
with
the
confident
assurance
of
one
who
has
no
doubt
had
not
the
man
said
that
this
was
a
public
park
and
that
she
had
as
good
a
right
as
anybody
to
be
there
she
walked
nearer
to
the
pond
and
crossed
the
bridge
to
the
of
the
little
boats
for
some
time
she
watched
the
children
happily
keeping
a
particularly
sharp
lookout
for
the
possible
black
curls
of
susie
smith
she
would
have
liked
to
take
a
ride
in
the
pretty
boats
herself
but
the
sign
said
five
cents
a
trip
and
she
did
not
have
any
money
with
her
she
smiled
hopefully
into
the
faces
of
several
women
and
twice
she
spoke
tentatively
but
no
one
spoke
first
to
her
and
those
whom
she
addressed
eyed
her
coldly
and
made
scant
response
after
a
time
she
turned
her
steps
into
still
another
path
here
she
found
a
boy
in
a
wheel
chair
she
would
have
spoken
to
him
but
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
book
that
she
turned
away
after
a
moment
wistful
gazing
soon
then
she
came
upon
a
pretty
but
young
girl
sitting
alone
staring
at
nothing
very
much
as
the
man
had
sat
with
a
contented
little
cry
pollyanna
hurried
forward
oh
how
do
you
do
she
beamed
i
so
glad
i
found
you
i
been
hunting
ever
so
long
for
you
she
asserted
dropping
herself
down
on
the
unoccupied
end
of
the
bench
the
pretty
girl
turned
with
a
start
an
eager
look
of
expectancy
in
her
eyes
oh
she
exclaimed
falling
back
in
plain
disappointment
i
thought
why
what
do
you
mean
she
demanded
aggrievedly
i
never
set
eyes
on
you
before
in
my
life
no
i
did
you
either
smiled
pollyanna
but
i
been
hunting
for
you
just
the
same
that
is
of
course
i
did
know
you
were
going
to
be
you
exactly
it
just
that
i
wanted
to
find
some
one
that
looked
lonesome
and
that
did
have
anybody
like
me
you
know
so
many
here
have
got
folks
see
yes
i
see
nodded
the
girl
falling
back
into
her
old
listlessness
but
poor
little
kid
it
too
bad
you
should
find
it
out
so
soon
find
what
out
that
the
lonesomest
place
in
all
the
world
is
in
a
crowd
in
a
big
city
pollyanna
frowned
and
pondered
is
it
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
i
do
see
how
you
can
be
lonesome
when
you
got
folks
all
around
you
still
she
hesitated
and
the
frown
deepened
i
was
lonesome
this
afternoon
and
there
were
folks
all
around
me
only
they
did
seem
to
to
think
or
notice
the
pretty
girl
smiled
bitterly
that
just
it
they
do
ever
think
or
notice
crowds
do
but
some
folks
do
we
can
be
glad
some
do
urged
pollyanna
now
when
i
oh
yes
some
do
interrupted
the
other
as
she
spoke
she
shivered
and
looked
fearfully
down
the
path
beyond
pollyanna
some
notice
too
much
pollyanna
shrank
back
in
dismay
repeated
rebuffs
that
afternoon
had
given
her
a
new
sensitiveness
do
you
mean
me
she
stammered
that
you
wished
i
had
noticed
you
no
no
kiddie
i
meant
some
one
quite
different
from
you
some
one
that
had
ought
to
notice
i
was
glad
to
have
you
speak
only
i
thought
at
first
it
was
some
one
from
home
oh
then
you
do
live
here
either
any
more
than
i
do
i
mean
for
keeps
oh
yes
i
live
here
now
sighed
the
girl
that
is
if
you
can
call
it
living
what
i
do
what
do
you
do
asked
pollyanna
interestedly
do
i
tell
you
what
i
do
cried
the
other
with
sudden
bitterness
from
morning
till
night
i
sell
fluffy
laces
and
perky
bows
to
girls
that
laugh
and
talk
and
know
each
other
then
i
go
home
to
a
little
back
room
up
three
flights
just
big
enough
to
hold
a
lumpy
a
washstand
with
a
nicked
pitcher
one
rickety
chair
and
me
it
like
a
furnace
in
the
summer
and
an
ice
box
in
the
winter
but
it
all
the
place
i
got
and
i
supposed
to
stay
in
it
when
i
ai
workin
but
i
come
out
i
ai
goin
to
stay
in
that
room
and
i
ai
goin
to
go
to
any
old
library
to
read
neither
it
our
last
this
year
and
an
extra
one
at
that
and
i
going
to
have
a
good
time
for
once
i
just
as
young
and
i
like
to
laugh
and
joke
just
as
well
as
them
girls
i
sell
bows
to
all
day
well
i
going
to
laugh
and
joke
pollyanna
smiled
and
nodded
her
approval
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
i
do
too
it
a
lot
more
fun
to
be
happy
is
it
besides
the
bible
tells
us
to
rejoice
and
be
glad
i
mean
it
tells
us
to
eight
hundred
times
probably
you
know
about
though
the
rejoicing
texts
the
pretty
girl
shook
her
head
a
queer
look
came
to
her
face
well
no
she
said
dryly
i
ca
say
i
was
thinkin
of
the
bible
were
you
well
maybe
not
but
you
see
my
father
was
a
minister
and
he
a
minister
yes
why
was
yours
too
cried
pollyanna
answering
something
she
saw
in
the
other
face
a
faint
color
crept
up
to
the
girl
forehead
oh
and
has
he
gone
like
mine
to
be
with
god
and
the
angels
the
girl
turned
away
her
head
no
he
still
living
back
home
she
answered
half
under
her
breath
oh
how
glad
you
must
be
sighed
pollyanna
enviously
sometimes
i
get
to
thinking
if
only
i
could
just
see
father
once
but
you
do
see
your
father
do
you
not
often
you
see
i
down
here
but
you
can
see
him
and
i
ca
mine
he
gone
to
be
with
mother
and
the
rest
of
us
up
in
heaven
and
have
you
got
a
mother
too
an
earth
mother
the
girl
stirred
restlessly
and
half
moved
as
if
to
go
oh
then
you
can
see
both
of
them
breathed
pollyanna
unutterable
longing
in
her
face
oh
how
glad
you
must
be
for
there
just
anybody
is
there
that
really
cares
and
notices
quite
so
much
as
fathers
and
mothers
you
see
i
know
for
i
had
a
father
until
i
was
eleven
years
old
but
for
a
mother
i
had
ladies
aiders
for
ever
so
long
till
aunt
polly
took
me
ladies
aiders
are
lovely
but
of
course
they
are
like
mothers
or
even
aunt
pollys
and
on
and
on
pollyanna
talked
pollyanna
was
in
her
element
now
pollyanna
loved
to
talk
that
there
was
anything
strange
or
unwise
or
even
unconventional
in
this
intimate
telling
of
her
thoughts
and
her
history
to
a
total
stranger
on
a
boston
park
bench
did
not
once
occur
to
pollyanna
to
pollyanna
all
men
women
and
children
were
friends
either
known
or
unknown
and
thus
far
she
had
found
the
unknown
quite
as
delightful
as
the
known
for
with
them
there
was
always
the
excitement
of
mystery
and
adventure
while
they
were
changing
from
the
unknown
to
the
known
to
this
young
girl
at
her
side
therefore
pollyanna
talked
unreservedly
of
her
father
her
aunt
polly
her
western
home
and
her
journey
east
to
vermont
she
told
of
new
friends
and
old
friends
and
of
course
she
told
of
the
game
pollyanna
almost
always
told
everybody
of
the
game
either
sooner
or
later
it
was
indeed
so
much
a
part
of
her
very
self
that
she
could
hardly
have
helped
telling
of
it
as
for
the
girl
she
said
little
she
was
not
now
sitting
in
her
old
listless
attitude
however
and
to
her
whole
self
had
come
a
marked
change
the
flushed
cheeks
frowning
brow
troubled
eyes
and
nervously
working
fingers
were
plainly
the
signs
of
some
inward
struggle
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
apprehensively
down
the
path
beyond
pollyanna
and
it
was
after
such
a
glance
that
she
clutched
the
little
girl
arm
see
here
kiddie
for
just
a
minute
do
you
leave
me
do
you
hear
stay
right
where
you
are
there
a
man
i
know
comin
but
no
matter
what
he
says
do
you
pay
no
attention
and
do
you
go
i
to
stay
with
you
see
before
pollyanna
could
more
than
gasp
her
wonderment
and
surprise
she
found
herself
looking
up
into
the
face
of
a
very
handsome
young
gentleman
who
had
stopped
before
them
oh
here
you
are
he
smiled
pleasantly
lifting
his
hat
to
pollyanna
companion
i
afraid
i
have
to
begin
with
an
apology
i
a
little
late
it
do
matter
sir
said
the
young
girl
speaking
hurriedly
i
i
decided
not
to
go
the
young
man
gave
a
light
laugh
oh
come
my
clear
do
be
hard
on
a
chap
because
he
a
little
late
it
is
that
really
defended
the
girl
a
swift
red
flaming
into
her
cheeks
i
mean
i
not
going
nonsense
the
man
stopped
smiling
he
spoke
sharply
you
said
yesterday
you
go
i
know
but
i
changed
my
mind
i
told
my
little
friend
here
stay
with
her
oh
but
if
you
rather
go
with
this
nice
young
gentleman
began
pollyanna
anxiously
but
she
fell
back
silenced
at
the
look
the
girl
gave
her
i
tell
you
i
had
not
rather
go
i
not
going
and
pray
why
this
sudden
face
demanded
the
young
man
with
an
expression
that
made
him
suddenly
look
to
pollyanna
not
quite
so
handsome
yesterday
you
said
i
know
i
did
interrupted
the
girl
feverishly
but
i
knew
then
that
i
had
ought
to
let
call
it
that
i
know
it
even
better
now
that
all
and
she
turned
away
resolutely
it
was
not
all
the
man
spoke
again
twice
he
coaxed
then
he
sneered
with
a
hateful
look
in
his
eyes
at
last
he
said
something
very
low
and
angry
which
pollyanna
did
not
understand
the
next
moment
he
wheeled
about
and
strode
away
the
girl
watched
him
tensely
till
he
passed
quite
out
of
sight
then
relaxing
she
laid
a
shaking
hand
on
pollyanna
arm
thanks
kiddie
i
reckon
i
owe
you
more
than
you
know
but
you
are
going
away
now
bemoaned
pollyanna
the
girl
sighed
wearily
i
got
to
he
might
come
back
and
next
time
i
might
not
be
able
to
she
clipped
the
words
short
and
rose
to
her
feet
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
then
she
choked
bitterly
you
see
he
the
kind
that
notices
too
much
and
that
had
ought
to
notice
me
at
all
with
that
she
was
gone
why
what
a
funny
lady
murmured
pollyanna
looking
wistfully
after
the
vanishing
figure
she
was
nice
but
she
was
sort
of
different
too
she
commented
rising
to
her
feet
and
moving
idly
down
the
path
chapter
vi
jerry
to
the
rescue
it
was
not
long
before
pollyanna
reached
the
edge
of
the
garden
at
a
corner
where
two
streets
crossed
it
was
a
wonderfully
interesting
corner
with
its
hurrying
cars
automobiles
carriages
and
pedestrians
a
huge
red
bottle
in
a
window
caught
her
eye
and
from
down
the
street
came
the
sound
of
a
hesitating
only
a
moment
pollyanna
darted
across
the
corner
and
skipped
lightly
down
the
street
toward
the
entrancing
music
pollyanna
found
much
to
interest
her
now
in
the
store
windows
were
marvelous
objects
and
around
the
when
she
had
reached
it
she
found
a
dozen
dancing
children
most
fascinating
to
watch
so
altogether
delightful
indeed
did
this
pastime
prove
to
be
that
pollyanna
followed
the
for
some
distance
just
to
see
those
children
dance
presently
she
found
herself
at
a
corner
so
busy
that
a
very
big
man
in
a
belted
blue
coat
helped
the
people
across
the
street
for
an
absorbed
minute
she
watched
him
in
silence
then
a
little
timidly
she
herself
started
to
cross
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
the
big
man
saw
her
at
once
and
promptly
beckoned
to
her
he
even
walked
to
meet
her
then
through
a
wide
lane
with
puffing
motors
and
impatient
horses
on
either
hand
she
walked
unscathed
to
the
further
curb
it
gave
her
a
delightful
sensation
so
delightful
that
after
a
minute
she
walked
back
twice
again
after
short
intervals
she
trod
the
fascinating
way
so
magically
opened
at
the
lifting
of
the
big
man
hand
but
the
last
time
her
conductor
left
her
at
the
curb
he
gave
a
puzzled
frown
illustration
twice
again
after
short
intervals
she
trod
the
fascinating
way
see
here
little
girl
ai
you
the
same
one
what
crossed
a
minute
ago
he
demanded
and
again
before
that
yes
sir
beamed
pollyanna
i
been
across
four
times
well
the
officer
began
to
bluster
but
pollyanna
was
still
talking
and
it
been
nicer
every
time
it
has
has
it
mumbled
the
big
man
lamely
then
with
a
little
more
spirit
he
sputtered
what
do
you
think
i
here
for
just
to
tote
you
back
and
forth
oh
no
sir
dimpled
pollyanna
of
course
you
are
just
for
me
there
are
all
these
others
i
know
what
you
are
you
a
policeman
we
got
one
of
you
out
where
i
live
at
carew
only
he
the
kind
that
just
walks
on
the
sidewalk
you
know
i
used
to
think
you
were
soldiers
on
account
of
your
gold
buttons
and
blue
hats
but
i
know
better
now
only
i
think
you
are
a
kind
of
a
soldier
you
so
brave
standing
here
like
this
right
in
the
middle
of
all
these
teams
and
automobiles
helping
folks
across
ho
ho
brrrr
spluttered
the
big
man
coloring
like
a
schoolboy
and
throwing
back
his
head
with
a
hearty
laugh
ho
ho
just
as
if
he
broke
off
with
a
quick
lifting
of
his
hand
the
next
moment
he
was
escorting
a
plainly
very
much
frightened
little
old
lady
from
curb
to
curb
if
his
step
were
a
bit
more
pompous
and
his
chest
a
bit
more
full
it
must
have
been
only
an
unconscious
tribute
to
the
watching
eyes
of
the
little
girl
back
at
the
a
moment
later
with
a
haughtily
permissive
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
chafing
drivers
and
chauffeurs
he
strolled
back
to
pollyanna
oh
that
was
splendid
she
greeted
him
with
shining
eyes
i
love
to
see
you
do
it
and
it
just
like
the
children
of
israel
crossing
the
red
sea
is
it
with
you
holding
back
the
waves
for
the
people
to
cross
and
how
glad
you
must
be
all
the
time
that
you
can
do
it
i
used
to
think
being
a
doctor
was
the
very
gladdest
business
there
was
but
i
reckon
after
all
being
a
policeman
is
gladder
yet
to
help
frightened
people
like
this
you
know
and
but
with
another
brrrr
and
an
embarrassed
laugh
the
big
man
was
back
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
pollyanna
was
all
alone
on
the
curbstone
for
only
a
minute
longer
did
pollyanna
watch
her
fascinating
red
sea
then
with
a
regretful
backward
glance
she
turned
away
i
reckon
maybe
i
better
be
going
home
now
she
meditated
it
must
be
dinner
time
and
briskly
she
started
to
walk
back
by
the
way
she
had
come
not
until
she
had
hesitated
at
several
corners
and
unwittingly
made
two
false
turns
did
pollyanna
grasp
the
fact
that
going
back
home
was
not
to
be
so
easy
as
she
had
thought
it
to
be
and
not
until
she
came
to
a
building
which
she
knew
she
had
never
seen
before
did
she
fully
realize
that
she
had
lost
her
way
she
was
on
a
narrow
street
dirty
and
dingy
tenement
blocks
and
a
few
unattractive
stores
were
on
either
side
all
about
were
jabbering
men
and
chattering
women
though
not
one
word
of
what
they
said
could
pollyanna
understand
moreover
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
people
looked
at
her
very
curiously
as
if
they
knew
she
did
not
belong
there
several
times
already
she
had
asked
her
way
but
in
vain
no
one
seemed
to
know
where
carew
lived
and
the
last
two
times
those
addressed
had
answered
with
a
gesture
and
a
jumble
of
words
which
pollyanna
after
some
thought
decided
must
be
dutch
the
kind
the
haggermans
the
only
foreign
family
in
beldingsville
used
on
and
on
down
one
street
and
up
another
pollyanna
trudged
she
was
thoroughly
frightened
now
she
was
hungry
too
and
very
tired
her
feet
ached
and
her
eyes
smarted
with
the
tears
she
was
trying
so
hard
to
hold
back
worse
yet
it
was
unmistakably
beginning
to
grow
dark
well
anyhow
she
choked
to
herself
i
going
to
be
glad
i
lost
it
be
so
nice
when
i
get
found
i
can
be
glad
for
that
it
was
at
a
noisy
corner
where
two
broader
streets
crossed
that
pollyanna
finally
came
to
a
dismayed
stop
this
time
the
tears
quite
overflowed
so
that
lacking
a
handkerchief
she
had
to
use
the
backs
of
both
hands
to
wipe
them
away
hullo
kid
why
the
weeps
queried
a
cheery
voice
what
up
with
a
relieved
little
cry
pollyanna
turned
to
confront
a
small
boy
carrying
a
bundle
of
newspapers
under
his
arm
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
she
exclaimed
i
so
wanted
to
see
some
one
who
did
talk
dutch
the
small
boy
grinned
dutch
nothin
he
scoffed
you
mean
dago
i
bet
ye
pollyanna
gave
a
slight
frown
well
anyway
it
it
was
english
she
said
doubtfully
and
they
could
answer
my
questions
but
maybe
you
can
do
you
know
where
carew
lives
nix
you
can
search
me
queried
pollyanna
still
more
doubtfully
the
boy
grinned
again
i
say
not
in
mine
i
guess
i
ai
acquainted
with
the
lady
but
is
there
anybody
anywhere
that
is
implored
pollyanna
you
see
i
just
went
out
for
a
walk
and
i
got
lost
i
been
ever
and
ever
so
far
but
i
ca
find
the
house
at
all
and
it

mean

and
getting
dark

the
boy
yes
and
i
afraid

too
sighed
pollyanna
gorry
if
you
ai
the
limit
chuckled
the
youth
unexpectedly
but
say
listen
do
ye
know
the
name
of
the
street
ye
want
no
only
that
it
some
kind
of
an
avenue

it
sure
now
some
class
to
that
we
doin
fine
what
the
number
of
the
house
can
ye
tell
me
that
just
scratch
your
head
scratch
my
head
pollyanna
frowned
questioningly
and
raised
a
tentative
hand
to
her
hair
the
boy
eyed
her
with
disdain
aw
come
off
yer
perch
ye
ai
so
dippy
as
all
that
i
say
ye
know
the
number
of
the
house

want
except

a
seven
in
it
returned
pollyanna
with
a
faintly
hopeful
air
wo
ye
listen
ter
that
gibed
the
scornful
youth
there
a
seven
in
it
an
she
expects
me
ter
know
it
when
i
see
it
oh
i
should
know
the
house
if
i
could
only
see
it
declared
pollyanna
eagerly
and
i
think
i
know
the
street
too
on
account
of
the
lovely
long
yard
running
right
up
and
down
through
the
middle
of
it
this
time
it
was
the
boy
who
gave
a
puzzled
frown
yard
he
queried
in
the
middle
of
a
street
yes
trees
and
grass
you
know
with
a
walk
in
the
middle
of
it
and
seats
and
but
the
boy
interrupted
her
with
a
whoop
of
delight
gee
whiz
commonwealth
avenue
sure
as
yer
livin
would
that
get
yer
goat
now
oh
do
you
know
do
you

that
sounded
like
it
only
i
do
know
what
you
meant
about
the
goat
part
there
are
any
goats
there
i
do
think

scoffed
the
boy

where

i
tote
sir
james
up
there
to
the
garden

an

here
till

stock
then
we
make
tracks
for
that
avenue
ye
can
say
jack
robinson
you
mean
you
take
me
home
appealed
pollyanna
still
plainly
not
quite
understanding
sure
it
a
cinch
if
you
know
the
house
oh
yes
i
know
the
house
replied
the
literal
pollyanna
anxiously
but
i
do
know
whether
it
a
a
cinch
or
not
if
it
is
you
but
the
boy
only
threw
her
another
disdainful
glance
and
darted
off
into
the
thick
of
the
crowd
a
moment
later
pollyanna
heard
his
strident
call
of
paper
paper
herald
globe
paper
sir
with
a
sigh
of
relief
pollyanna
stepped
back
into
a
doorway
and
waited
she
was
tired
but
she
was
happy
in
spite
of
sundry
puzzling
aspects
of
the
case
she
yet
trusted
the
boy
and
she
had
perfect
confidence
that
he
could
take
her
home
he
nice
and
i
like
him
she
said
to
herself
following
with
her
eyes
the
boy
alert
darting
figure
but
he
does
talk
funny
his
words
sound
english
but
some
of
them
do
seem
to
make
any
sense
with
the
rest
of
what
he
says
but
then
i
glad
he
found
me
anyway
she
finished
with
a
contented
little
sigh
it
was
not
long
before
the
boy
returned
his
hands
empty
come
on
kid
all
aboard
he
called
cheerily
now
we
hit
the
trail
for
the
avenue
if
i
was
the
real
thing
now
i
tote
ye
home
in
style
in
a
buzzwagon
but
seein
as
how
i
hai
got
the
dough
we
have
ter
hoof
it
it
was
for
the
most
part
a
silent
walk
pollyanna
for
once
in
her
life
was
too
tired
to
talk
even
of
the
ladies
aiders
and
the
boy
was
intent
on
picking
out
the
shortest
way
to
his
goal
when
the
public
garden
was
reached
pollyanna
did
exclaim
joyfully
oh
now
i
there
i
remember
this
place
i
had
a
perfectly
lovely
time
here
this
afternoon
it
only
a
little
bit
of
a
ways
home
now
that
the
stuff
now
we
gettin
there
crowed
the
boy
what
i
tell
ye
we
just
cut
through
here
to
the
avenue
an
then
it
be
up
ter
you
ter
find
the
house
oh
i
can
find
the
house
exulted
pollyanna
with
all
the
confidence
of
one
who
has
reached
familiar
ground
it
was
quite
dark
when
pollyanna
led
the
way
up
the
broad
carew
steps
the
boy
ring
at
the
bell
was
very
quickly
answered
and
pollyanna
found
herself
confronted
by
not
only
mary
but
by
carew
bridget
and
jennie
as
well
all
four
of
the
women
were
and
child
child
where
have
you
been
demanded
carew
hurrying
forward
why
i
i
just
went
to
walk
began
pollyanna
and
i
got
lost
and
this
boy
where
did
you
find
her
cut
in
carew
turning
imperiously
to
pollyanna
escort
who
was
at
the
moment
gazing
in
frank
admiration
at
the
wonders
about
him
in
the
hall
where
did
you
find
her
boy
she
repeated
sharply
for
a
brief
moment
the
boy
met
her
gaze
unflinchingly
then
something
very
like
a
twinkle
came
into
his
eyes
though
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
gravity
itself
well
i
found
her
bowdoin
square
but
i
reckon
she
been
doin
the
north
end
only
she
could
catch
on
ter
the
lingo
of
the
dagos
so
i
do
think
she
give
the
glad
hand
the
north
end
that
child
alone
pollyanna
shuddered
carew
oh
i
was
alone
carew
fended
pollyanna
there
were
ever
and
ever
so
many
people
there
were
there
boy
but
the
boy
with
an
impish
grin
was
disappearing
through
the
door
pollyanna
learned
many
things
during
the
next
she
learned
that
nice
little
girls
do
not
take
long
walks
alone
in
unfamiliar
cities
nor
sit
on
park
benches
and
talk
to
strangers
she
learned
also
that
it
was
only
by
a
perfectly
marvelous
miracle
that
she
had
reached
home
at
all
that
night
and
that
she
had
escaped
many
many
very
disagreeable
consequences
of
her
foolishness
she
learned
that
boston
was
not
beldingsville
and
that
she
must
not
think
it
was
but
carew
she
finally
argued
despairingly
i
am
here
and
i
did
get
lost
for
keeps
seems
as
if
i
ought
to
be
glad
for
that
instead
of
thinking
all
the
time
of
the
sorry
things
that
might
have
happened
yes
yes
child
i
suppose
so
i
suppose
so
sighed
carew
but
you
have
given
me
such
a
fright
and
i
want
you
to
be
sure
sure
sure
never
to
do
it
again
now
come
dear
you
must
be
hungry
it
was
just
as
she
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
that
night
that
pollyanna
murmured
drowsily
to
herself
the
thing
i
the
very
sorriest
for
of
anything
is
that
i
did
ask
that
boy
his
name
nor
where
he
lived
now
i
ca
ever
say
thank
you
to
him
chapter
vii
a
new
acquaintance
pollyanna
movements
were
most
carefully
watched
over
after
her
adventurous
walk
and
except
to
go
to
school
she
was
not
allowed
out
of
the
house
unless
mary
or
carew
herself
accompanied
her
this
to
pollyanna
however
was
no
cross
for
she
loved
both
carew
and
mary
and
delighted
to
be
with
them
they
were
too
for
a
while
very
generous
with
their
time
even
carew
in
her
terror
of
what
might
have
happened
and
her
relief
that
it
had
not
happened
exerted
herself
to
entertain
the
child
thus
it
came
about
that
with
carew
pollyanna
attended
concerts
and
matinees
and
visited
the
public
library
and
the
art
museum
and
with
mary
she
took
the
wonderful
seeing
boston
trips
and
visited
the
state
house
and
the
old
south
church
greatly
as
pollyanna
enjoyed
the
automobile
she
enjoyed
the
trolley
cars
more
as
carew
much
to
her
surprise
found
out
one
day
do
we
go
in
the
trolley
car
pollyanna
asked
eagerly
no
perkins
will
take
us
answered
carew
then
at
the
unmistakable
disappointment
in
pollyanna
face
she
added
in
surprise
why
i
thought
you
liked
the
auto
child
oh
i
do
acceded
pollyanna
hurriedly
and
i
would
say
anything
anyway
because
of
course
i
know
it
cheaper
than
the
trolley
car
and
than
the
trolley
car
exclaimed
carew
amazed
into
an
interruption
why
yes
explained
pollyanna
with
widening
eyes
the
trolley
car
costs
five
cents
a
person
you
know
and
the
auto
does
cost
anything
it
yours
and
of
course
i
love
the
auto
anyway
she
hurried
on
before
carew
could
speak
it
only
that
there
are
so
many
more
people
in
the
trolley
car
and
it
such
fun
to
watch
them
do
you
think
so
well
no
pollyanna
i
ca
say
that
i
do
responded
carew
dryly
as
she
turned
away
as
it
chanced
not
two
days
later
carew
heard
something
more
of
pollyanna
and
trolley
cars
this
time
from
mary
i
mean
it
queer
explained
mary
earnestly
in
answer
to
a
question
her
mistress
had
asked
it
queer
how
miss
pollyanna
just
gets
everybody
and
without
half
trying
it
is
that
she
does
anything
she
does
she
just
just
looks
glad
i
guess
that
all
but
i
seen
her
get
into
a
trolley
car
that
was
full
of
men
and
women
and
whimpering
children
and
in
five
minutes
you
would
know
the
place
the
men
and
women
have
stopped
scowling
and
the
children
have
forgot
what
they
cryin
for
sometimes
it
just
somethin
that
miss
pollyanna
has
said
to
me
and
they
heard
it
sometimes
it
just
the
you
she
gives
when
somebody
insists
on
givin
us
their
seat
and
they
always
that
givin
us
seats
i
mean
and
sometimes
it
the
way
she
smiles
at
a
baby
or
a
dog
all
dogs
everywhere
wag
their
tails
at
her
anyway
and
all
babies
big
and
little
smile
and
reach
out
to
her
if
we
get
held
up
it
a
joke
and
if
we
take
the
wrong
car
it
the
funniest
thing
that
ever
happened
and
that
the
way
is
about
everythin
one
just
ca
stay
grumpy
with
miss
pollyanna
even
if
you
only
one
of
a
trolley
car
full
of
folks
that
do
know
her
very
likely
murmured
carew
turning
away
october
proved
to
be
that
year
a
particularly
warm
delightful
month
and
as
the
golden
days
came
and
went
it
was
soon
very
evident
that
to
keep
up
with
pollyanna
eager
little
feet
was
a
task
which
would
consume
altogether
too
much
of
somebody
time
and
patience
and
while
carew
had
the
one
she
had
not
the
other
neither
had
she
the
willingness
to
allow
mary
to
spend
quite
so
much
of
her
time
whatever
her
patience
might
be
in
dancing
attendance
to
whims
and
fancies
to
keep
the
child
indoors
all
through
those
glorious
october
afternoons
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
thus
it
came
about
that
before
long
pollyanna
found
herself
once
more
in
the
lovely
big
yard
the
boston
public
garden
and
alone
apparently
she
was
as
free
as
before
but
in
reality
she
was
surrounded
by
a
high
stone
wall
of
regulations
she
must
not
talk
to
strange
men
or
women
she
must
not
play
with
strange
children
and
under
no
circumstances
must
she
step
foot
outside
the
garden
except
to
come
home
furthermore
mary
who
had
taken
her
to
the
garden
and
left
her
made
very
sure
that
she
knew
the
way
home
that
she
knew
just
where
commonwealth
avenue
came
down
to
arlington
street
across
from
the
garden
and
always
she
must
go
home
when
the
clock
in
the
church
tower
said
it
was
four
pollyanna
went
often
to
the
garden
after
this
occasionally
she
went
with
some
of
the
girls
from
school
more
often
she
went
alone
in
spite
of
the
somewhat
irksome
restrictions
she
enjoyed
herself
very
much
she
could
watch
the
people
even
if
she
could
not
talk
to
them
and
she
could
talk
to
the
squirrels
and
pigeons
and
sparrows
that
so
eagerly
came
for
the
nuts
and
grain
which
she
soon
learned
to
carry
to
them
every
time
she
went
pollyanna
often
looked
for
her
old
friends
of
that
first
day
the
man
who
was
so
glad
he
had
his
eyes
and
legs
and
arms
and
the
pretty
young
lady
who
would
not
go
with
the
handsome
man
but
she
never
saw
them
she
did
frequently
see
the
boy
in
the
wheel
chair
and
she
wished
she
could
talk
to
him
the
boy
fed
the
birds
and
squirrels
too
and
they
were
so
tame
that
the
doves
would
perch
on
his
head
and
shoulders
and
the
squirrels
would
burrow
in
his
pockets
for
nuts
but
pollyanna
watching
from
a
distance
always
noticed
one
strange
circumstance
in
spite
of
the
boy
very
evident
delight
in
serving
his
banquet
his
supply
of
food
always
ran
short
almost
at
once
and
though
he
invariably
looked
fully
as
disappointed
as
did
the
squirrel
after
a
nutless
burrowing
yet
he
never
remedied
the
matter
by
bringing
more
food
the
next
day
which
seemed
most
to
pollyanna
when
the
boy
was
not
playing
with
the
birds
and
squirrels
he
was
reading
always
reading
in
his
chair
were
usually
two
or
three
worn
books
and
sometimes
a
magazine
or
two
he
was
nearly
always
to
be
found
in
one
especial
place
and
pollyanna
used
to
wonder
how
he
got
there
then
one
unforgettable
day
she
found
out
it
was
a
school
holiday
and
she
had
come
to
the
garden
in
the
forenoon
and
it
was
soon
after
she
reached
the
place
that
she
saw
him
being
wheeled
along
one
of
the
paths
by
a
boy
she
gave
a
keen
glance
into
the
boy
face
then
ran
toward
him
with
a
glad
little
cry
oh
you
you
i
know
you
even
if
i
do
know
your
name
you
found
me
do
you
remember
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
i
so
wanted
to
say
thank
you
gee
if
it
ai
the
swell
little
lost
kid
of
the
avenoo
grinned
the
boy
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
lost
again
oh
no
exclaimed
pollyanna
dancing
up
and
down
on
her
toes
in
irrepressible
joy
i
ca
get
lost
any
more
i
have
to
stay
right
here
and
i
must
talk
you
know
but
i
can
to
you
for
i
know
you
and
i
can
to
him
after
you
introduce
me
she
finished
with
a
beaming
glance
at
the
lame
boy
and
a
hopeful
pause
the
youth
chuckled
softly
and
tapped
the
shoulder
of
the
boy
in
the
chair
listen
ter
that
will
ye
ai
that
the
real
thing
now
just
you
wait
while
i
introdooce
ye
and
he
struck
a
pompous
attitude
madam
this
is
me
friend
sir
james
lord
of
murphy
alley
and
but
the
boy
in
the
chair
interrupted
him
jerry
quit
your
nonsense
he
cried
vexedly
then
to
pollyanna
he
turned
a
glowing
face
i
seen
you
here
lots
of
times
before
watched
you
feed
the
birds
and
squirrels
you
always
have
such
a
lot
for
them
and
i
think
you
like
sir
lancelot
the
best
too
of
course
there
the
lady
rowena
but
was
she
rude
to
guinevere
yesterday
snatching
her
dinner
right
away
from
her
like
that
pollyanna
blinked
and
frowned
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
boys
in
plain
doubt
jerry
chuckled
again
then
with
a
final
push
he
wheeled
the
chair
into
its
usual
position
and
turned
to
go
over
his
shoulder
he
called
to
pollyanna
say
kid
jest
let
me
put
ye
wise
ter
somethin
this
chap
drunk
nor
crazy
see
them
jest
names
he
give
his
young
friends
here
with
a
flourish
of
his
arms
toward
the
furred
and
feathered
creatures
that
were
gathering
from
all
directions
an
they
even
names
of
folks
they
just
guys
out
of
books
are
ye
on
yet
he
ruther
feed
them
than
feed
hisself
ai
he
the
limit
sir
james
he
added
with
a
grimace
to
the
boy
in
the
chair
buck
up
now
nix
on
the
no
grub
racket
for
you
see
you
later
and
he
was
gone
pollyanna
was
still
blinking
and
frowning
when
the
lame
boy
turned
with
a
smile
you
must
mind
jerry
that
just
his
way
he
cut
off
his
right
hand
for
me
jerry
would
but
he
loves
to
tease
where
you
see
him
does
he
know
you
he
did
tell
me
your
name
i
pollyanna
whittier
i
was
lost
and
he
found
me
and
took
me
home
answered
pollyanna
still
a
little
dazedly
i
see
just
like
him
nodded
the
boy
do
he
tote
me
up
here
every
day
a
quick
sympathy
came
to
pollyanna
eyes
ca
you
walk
at
all
er
sir
the
boy
laughed
gleefully
james
indeed
that
only
more
of
jerry
nonsense
i
ai
a
pollyanna
looked
clearly
disappointed
you
are
nor
a
a
lord
like
he
said
i
sure
ai
oh
i
hoped
you
were
like
little
lord
fauntleroy
you
know
rejoined
pollyanna
and
but
the
boy
interrupted
her
with
an
eager
do
you
know
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
do
you
know
about
sir
lancelot
and
the
holy
grail
and
king
arthur
and
his
round
table
and
the
lady
rowena
and
ivanhoe
and
all
those
do
you
pollyanna
gave
her
head
a
dubious
shake
well
i
afraid
maybe
i
do
know
all
of
she
admitted
are
they
all
in
books
the
boy
nodded
i
got
here
some
of
he
said
i
like
to
read
over
and
over
there
always
something
new
in
besides
i
hai
got
no
others
anyway
these
were
father
here
you
little
rascal
quit
that
he
broke
off
in
laughing
reproof
as
a
squirrel
leaped
to
his
lap
and
began
to
nose
in
his
pockets
gorry
guess
better
give
them
their
dinner
or
they
be
tryin
to
eat
us
chuckled
the
boy
that
sir
lancelot
he
always
first
you
know
from
somewhere
the
boy
produced
a
small
pasteboard
box
which
he
opened
guardedly
mindful
of
the
numberless
bright
little
eyes
that
were
watching
every
move
all
about
him
now
sounded
the
whir
and
flutter
of
wings
the
cooing
of
doves
the
saucy
twitter
of
the
sparrows
sir
lancelot
alert
and
eager
occupied
one
arm
of
the
wheel
chair
another
little
fellow
less
venturesome
sat
back
on
his
haunches
five
feet
away
a
third
squirrel
chattered
noisily
on
a
neighboring
from
the
box
the
boy
took
a
few
nuts
a
small
roll
and
a
doughnut
at
the
latter
he
looked
longingly
hesitatingly
did
you
bring
anything
he
asked
then
lots
in
here
nodded
pollyanna
tapping
the
paper
bag
she
carried
oh
then
perhaps
i
will
eat
it
sighed
the
boy
dropping
the
doughnut
back
into
the
box
with
an
air
of
relief
pollyanna
on
whom
the
significance
of
this
action
was
quite
lost
thrust
her
fingers
into
her
own
bag
and
the
banquet
was
on
it
was
a
wonderful
hour
to
pollyanna
it
was
in
a
way
the
most
wonderful
hour
she
had
ever
spent
for
she
had
found
some
one
who
could
talk
faster
and
longer
than
she
could
this
strange
youth
seemed
to
have
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
marvelous
stories
of
brave
knights
and
fair
ladies
of
tournaments
and
battles
moreover
so
vividly
did
he
draw
his
pictures
that
pollyanna
saw
with
her
own
eyes
the
deeds
of
valor
the
knights
in
armor
and
the
fair
ladies
with
their
jeweled
gowns
and
tresses
even
though
she
was
really
looking
at
a
flock
of
fluttering
doves
and
sparrows
and
a
group
of
frisking
squirrels
on
a
wide
sweep
of
sunlit
grass
illustration
it
was
a
wonderful
hour
the
ladies
aiders
were
forgotten
even
the
glad
game
was
not
thought
of
pollyanna
with
flushed
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
was
trailing
down
the
golden
ages
led
by
a
boy
who
though
she
did
not
know
it
was
trying
to
crowd
into
this
one
short
hour
of
congenial
companionship
countless
dreary
days
of
loneliness
and
longing
not
until
the
noon
bells
sent
pollyanna
hurrying
homeward
did
she
remember
that
she
did
not
even
yet
know
the
boy
name
i
only
know
it
is
james
she
sighed
to
herself
frowning
with
vexation
but
never
mind
i
can
ask
him
chapter
viii
jamie
pollyanna
did
not
see
the
boy
it
rained
and
she
could
not
go
to
the
garden
at
all
it
rained
the
next
day
too
even
on
the
third
day
she
did
not
see
him
for
though
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
warm
and
though
she
went
very
early
in
the
afternoon
to
the
garden
and
waited
long
he
did
not
come
at
all
but
on
the
fourth
day
he
was
there
in
his
old
place
and
pollyanna
hastened
forward
with
a
joyous
greeting
oh
i
so
glad
glad
to
see
you
but
where
you
been
you
here
yesterday
at
all
i
could
the
pain
would
let
me
come
yesterday
explained
the
lad
who
was
looking
very
white
the
pain
oh
does
it
ache
stammered
pollyanna
all
sympathy
at
once
oh
yes
always
nodded
the
boy
with
a
cheerfully
air
most
generally
i
can
stand
it
and
come
here
just
the
same
except
when
it
gets
too
bad
same
as
was
yesterday
then
i
ca
but
how
can
you
stand
it
to
have
it
ache
always
gasped
pollyanna
why
i
have
to
answered
the
boy
opening
his
eyes
a
little
wider
things
that
are
so
are
so
and
they
ca
be
any
other
way
so
the
use
thinking
how
they
might
be
besides
the
harder
it
aches
one
day
the
nicer
is
to
have
it
the
next
i
know
that
like
the
ga
began
pollyanna
but
the
boy
interrupted
her
did
you
bring
a
lot
this
time
he
asked
anxiously
oh
i
hope
you
did
you
see
i
could
bring
them
any
jerry
could
spare
even
a
penny
for
peanuts
this
morning
and
there
was
really
enough
stuff
in
the
box
for
me
this
noon
pollyanna
looked
shocked
you
mean
that
you
did
have
enough
to
eat
yourself
for
your
luncheon
sure
smiled
the
boy
but
do
worry
tis
the
first
time
and
be
the
last
i
used
to
it
hi
there
here
comes
sir
lancelot
pollyanna
however
was
not
thinking
of
squirrels
and
was
there
any
more
at
home
oh
no
there
never
any
left
at
home
laughed
the
boy
you
see
mumsey
works
out
stairs
and
washings
so
she
gets
some
of
her
feed
in
them
places
and
jerry
picks
his
up
where
he
can
except
nights
and
mornings
he
gets
it
with
us
then
if
we
got
any
pollyanna
looked
still
more
shocked
but
what
do
you
do
when
you
do
have
anything
to
eat
go
hungry
of
course
but
i
never
heard
of
anybody
who
did
have
anything
to
eat
gasped
pollyanna
of
course
father
and
i
were
poor
and
we
had
to
eat
beans
and
fish
balls
when
we
wanted
turkey
but
we
had
something
why
you
tell
folks
all
these
folks
everywhere
that
live
in
these
houses
what
the
use
why
they
give
you
something
of
course
the
boy
laughed
once
more
this
time
a
little
queerly
guess
again
kid
you
got
another
one
coming
nobody
i
know
is
dishin
out
roast
beef
and
frosted
cakes
for
the
askin
besides
if
you
did
go
hungry
once
in
a
while
you
would
know
how
good
and
milk
can
taste
and
you
would
have
so
much
to
put
in
your
jolly
book
your
what
the
boy
gave
an
embarrassed
laugh
and
grew
suddenly
red
forget
it
i
did
think
for
a
minute
but
you
was
mumsey
or
jerry
but
what
is
your
jolly
book
pleaded
pollyanna
please
tell
me
are
there
knights
and
lords
and
ladies
in
that
the
boy
shook
his
head
his
eyes
lost
their
laughter
and
grew
dark
and
fathomless
no
i
there
was
he
sighed
wistfully
but
when
you
you
ca
even
walk
you
ca
fight
battles
and
win
trophies
and
have
fair
ladies
hand
you
your
sword
and
bestow
upon
you
the
golden
guerdon
a
sudden
fire
came
to
the
boy
eyes
his
chin
lifted
itself
as
if
in
response
to
a
bugle
call
then
as
suddenly
the
fire
died
and
the
boy
fell
back
into
his
old
listlessness
you
just
ca
do
nothin
he
resumed
wearily
after
a
silence
you
just
have
to
sit
and
think
and
times
like
that
your
think
gets
to
be
something
awful
mine
did
anyhow
i
wanted
to
go
to
school
and
learn
things
more
things
than
just
mumsey
can
teach
me
and
i
thought
of
that
i
wanted
to
run
and
play
ball
with
the
other
boys
and
i
thought
of
that
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
sell
papers
with
jerry
and
i
thought
of
that
i
did
want
to
be
taken
care
of
all
my
life
and
i
thought
of
that
i
know
oh
i
know
breathed
pollyanna
with
shining
eyes
did
i
lose
my
legs
for
a
while
did
you
then
you
do
know
some
but
you
got
yours
again
i
hai
you
know
sighed
the
boy
the
shadow
in
his
eyes
deepening
but
you
have
told
me
yet
about
the
jolly
book
prompted
pollyanna
after
a
minute
the
boy
stirred
and
laughed
shamefacedly
well
you
see
it
ai
much
after
all
except
to
me
you
see
much
in
it
i
started
it
a
year
ago
i
was
feelin
bad
that
day
nothin
was
right
for
a
while
i
grumped
it
out
just
thinkin
and
then
i
picked
up
one
of
father
books
and
tried
to
read
and
the
first
thing
i
see
was
this
i
learned
it
afterwards
so
i
can
say
it
now
lie
thickest
where
no
pleasures
seem
there
not
a
leaf
that
falls
upon
the
ground
but
holds
some
joy
of
silence
or
of
sound
footnote
blanchard
lyric
offerings
hidden
joys
well
i
was
mad
i
wished
i
could
put
the
guy
that
wrote
that
in
my
place
and
see
what
kind
of
joy
he
find
in
my
i
was
so
mad
i
made
up
my
mind
i
prove
he
did
know
what
he
was
talkin
about
so
i
begun
to
hunt
for
the
joys
in
my
you
know
i
took
a
little
old
empty
notebook
that
jerry
had
given
me
and
i
said
to
myself
that
i
write
down
everythin
that
had
anythin
about
it
that
i
liked
i
put
down
in
the
book
then
i
just
show
how
many
i
had
yes
yes
cried
pollyanna
absorbedly
as
the
boy
paused
for
breath
well
i
did
expect
to
get
many
but
do
you
know
i
got
a
lot
there
was
somethin
about
everythin
that
i
liked
a
little
so
in
it
had
to
go
the
very
first
one
was
the
book
itself
that
i
got
it
you
know
to
write
in
then
somebody
give
me
a
flower
in
a
pot
and
jerry
found
a
dandy
book
in
the
subway
after
that
it
was
really
fun
to
hunt
out
i
find
in
such
queer
places
sometimes
then
one
day
jerry
got
hold
of
the
little
notebook
and
found
out
what
then
he
give
it
its
name
the
jolly
book
and
and
that
all
all
all
cried
pollyanna
delight
and
amazement
struggling
for
the
mastery
on
her
glowing
little
face
why
that
the
game
playing
the
glad
game
and
do
know
it
only
you
playing
it
ever
and
ever
so
much
better
than
i
ever
could
why
i
i
could
play
it
at
all
i
afraid
if
i
i
did
have
enough
to
eat
and
ever
walk
or
anything
she
choked
the
game
what
game
i
do
know
anything
about
any
game
frowned
the
boy
pollyanna
clapped
her
hands
i
know
you
do
i
know
you
do
and
that
why
it
so
perfectly
lovely
and
so
so
wonderful
but
listen
i
tell
you
what
the
game
is
and
she
told
him
gee
breathed
the
boy
appreciatively
when
she
had
finished
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
here
you
are
playing
my
game
better
than
anybody
i
ever
saw
and
i
do
even
know
your
name
yet
nor
anything
exclaimed
pollyanna
in
almost
awestruck
tones
but
i
want
to
i
want
to
know
everything
pooh
there
nothing
to
know
rejoined
the
boy
with
a
shrug
besides
see
here
poor
sir
lancelot
and
all
the
rest
waiting
for
their
dinner
he
finished
dear
me
so
they
are
sighed
pollyanna
glancing
impatiently
at
the
fluttering
and
chattering
creatures
all
about
them
recklessly
she
turned
her
bag
upside
down
and
scattered
her
supplies
to
the
four
winds
there
now
that
done
and
we
can
talk
again
she
rejoiced
and
there
such
a
lot
i
want
to
know
first
please
what
is
your
name
i
only
know
it
is
james
the
boy
smiled
no
it
is
but
that
what
jerry
always
calls
me
mumsey
and
the
rest
call
me
pollyanna
caught
her
breath
and
held
it
suspended
a
wild
hope
had
come
to
her
eyes
it
was
followed
almost
instantly
however
by
fearful
doubt
does
mean
mother
sure
pollyanna
relaxed
visibly
her
face
fell
if
this
jamie
had
a
mother
he
could
not
of
course
be
carew
jamie
whose
mother
had
died
long
ago
still
even
as
he
was
he
was
wonderfully
interesting
but
where
do
you
live
she
catechized
eagerly
is
there
anybody
else
in
your
family
but
your
mother
and
and
jerry
do
you
always
come
here
every
day
where
is
your
jolly
book
may
i
see
it
do
the
doctors
say
you
can
ever
walk
again
and
where
was
it
you
said
you
got
it
this
wheel
chair
i
mean
the
boy
chuckled
say
how
many
of
them
questions
do
you
expect
me
to
answer
all
at
once
i
begin
at
the
last
one
anyhow
and
work
backwards
maybe
if
i
do
forget
what
they
be
i
got
this
chair
a
year
ago
jerry
knew
one
of
them
fellers
what
writes
for
papers
you
know
and
he
put
it
in
about
me
how
i
could
ever
walk
and
all
that
and
and
the
jolly
book
you
see
the
first
thing
i
knew
a
whole
lot
of
men
and
women
come
one
day
toting
this
chair
and
said
was
for
me
that
they
read
all
about
me
and
they
wanted
me
to
have
it
to
remember
them
by
my
how
glad
you
must
have
been
i
was
it
took
a
whole
page
of
my
jolly
book
to
tell
about
that
chair
but
ca
you
ever
walk
again
pollyanna
eyes
were
blurred
with
tears
it
do
look
like
it
they
said
i
could
oh
but
that
what
they
said
about
me
and
then
they
sent
me
to
ames
and
i
stayed
a
year
and
he
made
me
walk
maybe
he
could
you
the
boy
shook
his
head
he
could
you
see
i
could
go
to
him
anyway
cost
too
much
we
just
have
to
call
it
that
i
ca
ever
walk
again
but
never
mind
the
boy
threw
back
his
head
impatiently
i
trying
not
to
think
of
that
you
know
what
it
is
when
when
your
think
gets
to
going
yes
yes
of
course
and
here
i
am
talking
about
it
cried
pollyanna
penitently
i
said
you
knew
how
to
play
the
game
better
than
i
did
now
but
go
on
you
have
told
me
half
yet
where
do
you
live
and
is
jerry
all
the
brothers
and
sisters
you
got
a
swift
change
came
to
the
boy
face
his
eyes
glowed
yes
and
he
ai
mine
really
he
ai
any
relation
nor
mumsey
ai
neither
and
only
think
how
good
they
been
to
me
what
that
questioned
pollyanna
instantly
on
the
alert
that
that
your
mother
at
all
no
and
that
what
makes
and
have
you
got
any
mother
interrupted
pollyanna
in
growing
excitement
no
i
never
remember
any
mother
and
father
died
six
years
ago
how
old
were
you
i
do
know
i
was
little
mumsey
says
she
guesses
maybe
i
was
about
six
that
when
they
took
me
you
see
and
your
name
is
jamie
pollyanna
was
holding
her
breath
why
yes
i
told
you
that
and
what
the
other
name
longingly
but
fearfully
pollyanna
asked
this
question
i
do
know
you
do
know
i
do
remember
i
was
too
little
i
suppose
even
the
murphys
know
they
never
knew
me
as
anything
but
jamie
a
great
disappointment
came
to
pollyanna
face
but
almost
immediately
a
flash
of
thought
drove
the
shadow
away
well
anyhow
if
you
do
know
what
your
name
is
you
ca
know
it
is
she
exclaimed
puzzled
the
boy
yes
began
pollyanna
all
excitement
you
see
there
was
a
little
boy
named
jamie
kent
that
she
stopped
abruptly
and
bit
her
lip
it
had
occurred
to
pollyanna
that
it
would
be
kinder
not
to
let
this
boy
know
yet
of
her
hope
that
he
might
be
the
lost
jamie
it
would
be
better
that
she
make
sure
of
it
before
raising
any
expectations
otherwise
she
might
be
bringing
him
sorrow
rather
than
joy
she
had
not
forgotten
how
disappointed
jimmy
bean
had
been
when
she
had
been
obliged
to
tell
him
that
the
ladies
aid
did
not
want
him
and
again
when
at
first
pendleton
had
not
wanted
him
either
she
was
determined
that
she
would
not
make
the
same
mistake
a
third
time
so
very
promptly
now
she
assumed
an
air
of
elaborate
indifference
on
this
most
dangerous
subject
as
she
said
but
never
mind
about
jamie
kent
tell
me
about
yourself
i
so
interested
there
is
anything
to
tell
i
do
know
anything
nice
hesitated
the
boy
they
said
father
was
was
queer
and
never
talked
they
did
even
know
his
name
everybody
called
him
professor
mumsey
says
he
and
i
lived
in
a
little
back
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
in
lowell
where
they
used
to
live
they
were
poor
then
but
they
was
near
so
poor
as
they
are
now
jerry
father
was
alive
them
days
and
had
a
job
yes
yes
go
on
prompted
pollyanna
well
mumsey
says
my
father
was
sick
a
lot
and
he
got
queerer
and
queerer
so
that
they
had
me
downstairs
with
them
a
good
deal
i
could
walk
then
a
little
but
my
legs
was
right
i
played
with
jerry
and
the
little
girl
that
died
well
when
father
died
there
anybody
to
take
me
and
some
men
were
goin
to
put
me
in
an
orphan
asylum
but
mumsey
says
i
took
on
so
and
jerry
took
on
so
that
they
said
they
keep
me
and
they
did
the
little
girl
had
just
died
and
they
said
i
might
take
her
place
and
they
had
me
ever
since
and
i
fell
and
got
worse
and
they
awful
poor
now
too
besides
father
dyin
but
they
kept
me
now
ai
that
what
you
call
pretty
good
to
a
feller
yes
oh
yes
cried
pollyanna
but
they
get
their
reward
i
know
they
get
their
reward
pollyanna
was
quivering
with
delight
now
the
last
doubt
had
fled
she
had
found
the
lost
jamie
she
was
sure
of
it
but
not
yet
must
she
speak
first
carew
must
see
him
then
then
even
pollyanna
imagination
failed
when
it
came
to
picturing
the
bliss
in
store
for
carew
and
jamie
at
that
glad
reunion
she
sprang
lightly
to
her
feet
in
utter
disregard
of
sir
lancelot
who
had
come
back
and
was
nosing
in
her
lap
for
more
nuts
i
got
to
go
now
but
i
come
again
maybe
i
have
a
lady
with
me
that
you
like
to
know
you
be
here
you
she
finished
anxiously
sure
if
it
pleasant
jerry
totes
me
up
here
every
mornin
they
fixed
it
so
he
could
you
know
and
i
bring
my
dinner
and
stay
till
four
jerry
good
to
me
he
is
i
know
i
know
nodded
pollyanna
and
maybe
you
find
somebody
else
to
be
good
to
you
too
she
caroled
with
which
cryptic
statement
and
a
beaming
smile
she
was
gone
chapter
ix
plans
and
plottings
on
the
way
home
pollyanna
made
joyous
plans
in
some
way
or
other
carew
must
be
persuaded
to
go
with
her
for
a
walk
in
the
public
garden
just
how
this
was
to
be
brought
about
pollyanna
did
not
know
but
brought
about
it
must
be
to
tell
carew
plainly
that
she
had
found
jamie
and
wanted
her
to
go
to
see
him
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
of
course
a
bare
chance
that
this
might
not
be
her
jamie
and
if
it
were
not
and
if
she
had
thus
raised
in
carew
false
hopes
the
result
might
be
disastrous
pollyanna
knew
from
what
mary
had
told
her
that
twice
already
carew
had
been
made
very
ill
by
the
great
disappointment
of
following
alluring
clues
that
had
led
to
some
boy
very
different
from
her
dead
sister
son
so
pollyanna
knew
that
she
could
not
tell
carew
why
she
wanted
her
to
go
to
walk
in
the
public
garden
but
there
would
be
a
way
declared
pollyanna
to
herself
as
she
happily
hurried
homeward
fate
however
as
it
happened
once
more
intervened
in
the
shape
of
a
heavy
rainstorm
and
pollyanna
did
not
have
to
more
than
look
out
of
doors
the
next
morning
to
realize
that
there
would
be
no
public
garden
stroll
that
day
worse
yet
neither
the
next
day
nor
the
next
saw
the
clouds
dispelled
and
pollyanna
spent
all
three
afternoons
wandering
from
window
to
window
peering
up
into
the
sky
and
anxiously
demanding
of
every
one
do
you
think
it
looks
a
little
like
clearing
up
so
unusual
was
this
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
cheery
little
girl
and
so
irritating
was
the
constant
questioning
that
at
last
carew
lost
her
patience
for
pity
sake
child
what
is
the
trouble
she
cried
i
never
knew
you
to
fret
so
about
the
weather
where
that
wonderful
glad
game
of
yours
pollyanna
reddened
and
looked
abashed
dear
me
i
reckon
maybe
i
did
forget
the
game
this
time
she
admitted
and
of
course
there
is
something
about
it
i
can
be
glad
for
if
i
only
hunt
for
it
i
can
be
glad
that
that
it
will
have
to
stop
raining
sometime
god
said
he
would
send
another
flood
but
you
see
i
did
so
want
it
to
be
pleasant
why
especially
oh
i
i
just
wanted
to
go
to
walk
in
the
public
garden
pollyanna
was
trying
hard
to
speak
unconcernedly
i
i
thought
maybe
you
like
to
go
with
me
too
outwardly
pollyanna
was
nonchalance
itself
inwardly
however
she
was
aquiver
with
excitement
and
suspense
go
to
walk
in
the
public
garden
queried
carew
with
brows
slightly
uplifted
thank
you
no
i
afraid
not
she
smiled
oh
but
you
you
would
refuse
faltered
pollyanna
in
quick
panic
i
have
refused
pollyanna
swallowed
convulsively
she
had
grown
really
pale
but
carew
please
please
do
say
you
wo
go
when
it
gets
pleasant
she
begged
you
see
for
a
a
special
reason
i
wanted
you
to
go
with
me
just
this
once
carew
frowned
she
opened
her
lips
to
make
the
no
more
decisive
but
something
in
pollyanna
pleading
eyes
must
have
changed
the
words
for
when
they
came
they
were
a
reluctant
acquiescence
well
well
child
have
your
own
way
but
if
i
promise
to
go
you
must
promise
not
to
go
near
the
window
for
an
hour
and
not
to
ask
again
if
i
think
it
going
to
clear
up
yes
i
will
i
mean
i
wo
palpitated
pollyanna
then
as
a
pale
shaft
of
light
that
was
almost
a
sunbeam
came
aslant
through
the
window
she
cried
joyously
but
you
do
think
it
is
going
to
oh
she
broke
off
in
dismay
and
ran
from
the
room
unmistakably
it
cleared
up
the
next
morning
but
though
the
sun
shone
brightly
there
was
a
sharp
chill
in
the
air
and
by
afternoon
when
pollyanna
came
home
from
school
there
was
a
brisk
wind
in
spite
of
protests
however
she
insisted
that
it
was
a
beautiful
day
out
and
that
she
should
be
perfectly
miserable
if
carew
would
not
come
for
a
walk
in
the
public
garden
and
carew
went
though
still
protesting
as
might
have
been
expected
it
was
a
fruitless
journey
together
the
impatient
woman
and
the
little
girl
hurried
shiveringly
up
one
path
and
down
another
pollyanna
not
finding
the
boy
in
his
accustomed
place
was
making
frantic
search
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
garden
to
pollyanna
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
have
it
so
here
she
was
in
the
garden
and
here
with
her
was
carew
but
not
anywhere
to
be
found
was
jamie
and
yet
not
one
word
could
she
say
to
mrs
carew
at
last
thoroughly
chilled
and
exasperated
carew
insisted
on
going
home
and
despairingly
pollyanna
went
sorry
days
came
to
pollyanna
then
what
to
her
was
perilously
near
a
second
deluge
but
according
to
carew
was
merely
the
usual
fall
rains
brought
a
series
of
damp
foggy
cold
cheerless
days
filled
with
either
a
dreary
drizzle
of
rain
or
worse
yet
a
steady
downpour
if
perchance
occasionally
there
came
a
day
of
sunshine
pollyanna
always
flew
to
the
garden
but
in
vain
jamie
was
never
there
it
was
the
middle
of
november
now
and
even
the
garden
itself
was
full
of
dreariness
the
trees
were
bare
the
benches
almost
empty
and
not
one
boat
was
on
the
little
pond
true
the
squirrels
and
pigeons
were
there
and
the
sparrows
were
as
pert
as
ever
but
to
feed
them
was
almost
more
of
a
sorrow
than
a
joy
for
every
saucy
switch
of
sir
lancelot
feathery
tail
but
brought
bitter
memories
of
the
lad
who
had
given
him
his
name
and
who
was
not
there
and
to
think
i
did
find
out
where
he
lived
mourned
pollyanna
to
herself
over
and
over
again
as
the
days
passed
and
he
was
jamie
i
just
know
he
was
jamie
and
now
i
have
to
wait
and
wait
till
spring
comes
and
it
warm
enough
for
him
to
come
here
again
and
then
maybe
be
coming
here
by
that
time
o
dear
o
dear
and
he
was
jamie
i
know
he
was
jamie
then
one
dreary
afternoon
the
unexpected
happened
pollyanna
passing
through
the
upper
hallway
heard
angry
voices
in
the
hall
below
one
of
which
she
recognized
as
being
mary
while
the
other
the
other
the
other
voice
was
saying
not
on
yer
life
it
nix
on
the
beggin
business

get

i
wants

the
kid

message
for

from
from
sir
james
now
beat
it
will

and
trot
out
the
kid
if
ye
mind
with
a
glad
little
cry
pollyanna
turned
and
fairly
flew
down
the
stairway
oh
i
here
i
here
i
right
here
she
panted
stumbling
forward
what
is
it
did
jamie
send
you
in
her
excitement
she
had
almost
flung
herself
with
outstretched
arms
upon
the
boy
when
mary
intercepted
a
shocked
restraining
hand
miss
pollyanna
miss
pollyanna
do
you
mean
to
say
you
know
this
this
beggar
boy
the
boy
flushed
angrily
but
before
he
could
speak
pollyanna
interposed
valiant
championship
he
is
a
beggar
boy
he
belongs
to
one
of
my
very
best
friends
besides
he
the
one
that
found
me
and
brought
me
home
that
time
i
was
lost
then
to
the
boy
she
turned
with
impetuous
questioning
what
is
it
did
jamie
send
you
sure
he
did
he
hit
the
hay
a
month
ago
and
he
hai
been

pollyanna
of
course

hat

away
miss
pollyanna
gasped
mary
in
stern
disapproval
as
if
carew
would
let
you
go
anywhere
with
a
strange
boy
like
this
but
he
is
a
strange
boy
objected
pollyanna
i
known
him
ever
so
long
and
i
must
go
i
what
in
the
world
is
the
meaning
of
this
demanded
carew
icily
from
the
doorway
pollyanna
who
is
this
boy
and
what
is
he
doing
here
pollyanna
turned
with
a
quick
cry
oh
carew
you
let
me
go
wo
you
go
where
to
see
my
brother
cut
in
the
boy
hurriedly
and
with
an
obvious
effort
to
be
very
polite
he
sort
of
off
his
feed
ye
know
and
he
would
give
me
no
peace
till
i
come
up
after
her
with
an
awkward
gesture
toward
pollyanna
he
thinks
a
sight

pleaded
pollyanna
carew
frowned

wild
enough
to
think
of
it
for
a
moment

began
pollyanna
i
absurd
child
that

impossible

give
this
boy
here
a
little
money
if
you
like
but
thank

pollyanna

carew
shook
her
head
it

out
of
the
question
pollyanna

almost
sobbed
pollyanna
i

an
angry
color
flamed
into
carew
cheeks
pollyanna
this
is
sheer
nonsense
i
am
surprised
i
am
amazed
at
you
for
insisting
upon
doing
something
you

i
disapprove
of
i
can
not
allow
you
to
go
with
this
boy
now
please
let
me
hear
no
more
about
it
a
new
expression
came
to
pollyanna
face
with
a
look
she
lifted
her
chin
and
squarely
faced
carew
tremulously
but
determinedly
she
spoke
then
i
have
to
tell
you
i
did
mean
to
till
i
was
sure
i
wanted
you
to
see
him
first
but
now
i
got
to
tell
i
ca
lose
him

i
think
carew

my
jamie
carew
face

grown
very
white
yes
impossible
i

jamie
and
he
does
know
the
other
one
his
father
died
when
he
was
six
years
old
and
he
ca
remember
his
mother
he
twelve
years
old
he
thinks
these
folks
took
him
in
when
his
father
died
and
his
father
was
queer
and
did
tell
folks
his
name
and
but
carew
had
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
carew
was
even
whiter
than
before
but
her
eyes
burned
with
a
sudden
fire
we
go
at
once
she
said
mary
tell
perkins
to
have
the
car
here
as
soon
as
possible
pollyanna
get
your
hat
and
coat
boy
wait
here
please
we
be
ready
to
go
with
you
immediately
the
next
minute
she
had
hurried
in
the
hall
the
boy
drew
a
long
breath
gee
whiz
he
muttered
softly
if
we
ai
goin
ter
go
in
a
some
class
ter
that
gorry
what
sir
james
say
chapter
x
in
murphy
alley
with
the
opulent
purr
that
seems
to
be
peculiar
to
luxurious
limousines
carew
car
rolled
down
commonwealth
avenue
and
out
upon
arlington
street
to
charles
inside
sat
a
little
girl
and
a
tense
woman
outside
to
give
directions
to
the
plainly
disapproving
chauffeur
sat
jerry
murphy
inordinately
proud
and
insufferably
important
when
the
limousine
came
to
a
stop
before
a
shabby
doorway
in
a
narrow
dirty
alley
the
boy
leaped
to
the
ground
and
with
a
ridiculous
imitation
of
the
liveried
pomposities
he
had
so
often
watched
threw
open
the
door
of
the
car
and
stood
waiting
for
the
ladies
to
alight
pollyanna
sprang
out
at
once
her
eyes
widening
with
amazement
and
distress
as
she
looked
about
her
behind
her
came
carew
visibly
shuddering
as
her
gaze
swept
the
filth
the
sordidness
and
the
ragged
children
that
swarmed
shrieking
and
chattering
out
of
the
dismal
tenements
and
surrounded
the
car
in
a
second
jerry
waved
his
arms
angrily
here
you
beat
it
he
yelled
to
the
motley
throng
this
ai
no
free
movies
can
that
racket
and
get
a
move
on
ye
lively
now
we
got
ta
get
by
jamie
got
carew
shuddered
again
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
shoulder
not
here
she
recoiled
but
the
boy
did
not
hear
with
shoves
and
pushes
from
sturdy
fists
and
elbows
he
was
making
a
path
for
his
charges
and
before
carew
knew
quite
how
it
was
done
she
found
herself
with
the
boy
and
pollyanna
at
the
foot
of
a
rickety
flight
of
stairs
in
a
dim
hallway
once
more
she
put
out
a
shaking
hand
wait
she
commanded
huskily
remember
do
either
of
you
say
a
word
about
about
his
being
possibly
the
boy
i
looking
for
i
must
see
for
myself
first
and
question
him
of
course
agreed
pollyanna
sure
i
on
nodded
the
boy
i
got
ta
go
right
off
anyhow
so
i
wo
bother
ye
none
now
toddle
easy
up
these
stairs
always
holes
and
most
generally
there
a
kid
or
two
asleep
somewheres
an
the
elevator
ai
runnin
he
gibed
cheerfully
we
got
ta
go
ter
the
top
too
carew
found
the
holes
broken
boards
that
creaked
and
bent
fearsomely
under
her
shrinking
feet
and
she
found
one
kid
a
baby
playing
with
an
empty
tin
can
on
a
string
which
he
was
banging
up
and
down
the
second
flight
of
stairs
on
all
sides
doors
were
opened
now
boldly
now
stealthily
but
always
disclosing
women
with
tousled
heads
or
peering
children
with
dirty
faces
somewhere
a
baby
was
wailing
piteously
somewhere
else
a
man
was
cursing
everywhere
was
the
smell
of
bad
whiskey
stale
cabbage
and
unwashed
humanity
at
the
top
of
the
third
and
last
stairway
the
boy
came
to
a
pause
before
a
closed
door
i
just
what
sir
james
say
when
he
wise
ter
the
prize
package
i
bringin
him
he
whispered
in
a
throaty
voice
i
know
what
mumsey
do
she
turn
on
the
weeps
in
no
time
ter
see
jamie
so
tickled
the
next
moment
he
threw
wide
the
door
with
a
gay
here
we
be
an
we
come
in
a
ai
that
goin
some
sir
james
it
was
a
tiny
room
cold
and
cheerless
and
pitifully
bare
but
scrupulously
neat
there
were
here
no
tousled
heads
no
peering
children
no
odors
of
whiskey
cabbage
and
unclean
humanity
there
were
two
beds
three
broken
chairs
a
table
and
a
stove
with
a
faint
glow
of
light
that
told
of
a
fire
not
nearly
brisk
enough
to
heat
even
that
tiny
room
on
one
of
the
beds
lay
a
lad
with
flushed
cheeks
and
eyes
near
him
sat
a
thin
woman
bent
and
twisted
with
rheumatism
carew
stepped
into
the
room
and
as
if
to
steady
herself
paused
a
minute
with
her
back
to
the
wall
pollyanna
hurried
forward
with
a
low
cry
just
as
jerry
with
an
apologetic
i
got
ta
go
now
dashed
through
the
door
oh
jamie
i
so
glad
i
found
you
cried
pollyanna
you
know
how
i
looked
and
looked
for
you
every
day
but
i
so
sorry
you
sick
jamie
smiled
radiantly
and
held
out
a
thin
white
hand
i
ai
sorry
i
glad
he
emphasized
meaningly
brought
you
to
see
me
besides
i
better
now
anyway
mumsey
this
is
the
little
girl
you
know
that
told
me
the
glad
game
and
playing
it
too
he
triumphed
turning
back
to
pollyanna
first
she
cried
her
back
hurts
too
bad
to
let
her
work
then
when
i
was
took
worse
she
was
glad
she
could
work
she
could
be
here
to
take
care
of
me
you
know
at
that
moment
carew
hurried
forward
her
eyes
on
the
face
of
the
lame
boy
in
the
bed
it
carew
i
brought
her
to
see
you
jamie
introduced
pollyanna
in
a
tremulous
voice
the
little
twisted
woman
by
the
bed
had
struggled
to
her
feet
by
this
time
and
was
nervously
offering
her
chair
carew
accepted
it
without
so
much
as
a
glance
her
eyes
were
still
on
the
boy
in
the
bed
your
name
is
jamie
she
asked
with
visible
difficulty
yes
the
boy
bright
eyes
looked
straight
into
hers
what
is
your
other
name
i
do
know
he
is
not
your
son
for
the
first
time
carew
turned
to
the
twisted
little
woman
who
was
still
standing
by
the
bed
no
madam
and
you
do
know
his
name
no
madam
i
never
knew
it
with
a
despairing
gesture
carew
turned
back
to
the
boy
but
think
think
do
you
remember
anything
of
your
name
but
jamie
the
boy
shook
his
head
into
his
eyes
was
coming
a
puzzled
wonder
no
nothing
have
you
anything
that
belonged
to
your
father
with
possibly
his
name
in
it
there
was
anythin
worth
savin
but
them
books
interposed
murphy
them
his
maybe
you
like
to
look
at
she
suggested
pointing
to
a
row
of
worn
volumes
on
a
shelf
across
the
room
then
in
plainly
uncontrollable
curiosity
she
asked
was
you
thinkin
you
knew
him
i
do
know
murmured
carew
in
a
voice
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
shelf
of
books
there
were
not
many
perhaps
ten
or
a
dozen
there
was
a
volume
of
shakespeare
plays
an
ivanhoe
a
lady
of
the
lake
a
book
of
miscellaneous
poems
a
coverless
tennyson
a
dilapidated
little
lord
fauntleroy
and
two
or
three
books
of
ancient
and
medieval
history
but
though
carew
looked
carefully
through
every
one
she
found
nowhere
any
written
word
with
a
despairing
sigh
she
turned
back
to
the
boy
and
to
the
woman
both
of
whom
now
were
watching
her
with
startled
questioning
eyes
i
wish
you
tell
me
both
of
you
all
you
know
about
yourselves
she
said
brokenly
dropping
herself
once
more
into
the
chair
by
the
bed
and
they
told
her
it
was
much
the
same
story
that
jamie
had
told
pollyanna
in
the
public
garden
there
was
little
that
was
new
nothing
that
was
significant
in
spite
of
the
probing
questions
that
carew
asked
at
its
conclusion
jamie
turned
eager
eyes
on
face
do
you
think
you
knew
my
father
he
begged
carew
closed
her
eyes
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
head
i
do
know
she
answered
but
i
think
not
pollyanna
gave
a
quick
cry
of
keen
disappointment
but
as
quickly
she
suppressed
it
in
obedience
to
carew
warning
glance
with
new
horror
however
she
surveyed
the
tiny
room
jamie
turning
his
wondering
eyes
from
carew
face
suddenly
awoke
to
his
duties
as
host
was
you
good
to
come
he
said
to
pollyanna
gratefully
sir
lancelot
do
you
ever
go
to
feed
him
now
then
as
pollyanna
did
not
answer
at
once
he
hurried
on
his
eyes
going
from
her
face
to
the
somewhat
battered
pink
in
a
bottle
in
the
window
did
you
see
my
posy
jerry
found
it
somebody
dropped
it
and
he
picked
it
up
ai
it
pretty
and
it
smells
a
little
but
pollyanna
did
not
seem
even
to
have
heard
him
she
was
still
gazing
about
the
room
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
nervously
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
ever
play
the
game
here
at
all
jamie
she
faltered
i
did
suppose
there
could
be
anywhere
such
a
perfectly
awful
place
to
live
she
shuddered
ho
scoffed
jamie
valiantly
you
oughter
see
the
theirs
is
a
whole
lot
this
you
do
know
what
a
lot
of
nice
things
there
is
about
this
room
why
we
get
the
sun
in
that
winder
there
for
two
hours
every
day
when
it
shines
and
if
you
get
real
near
it
you
can
see
a
whole
lot
of
sky
from
it
if
we
could
only
keep
the
room
but
you
see
we
got
to
leave
afraid
and
that
what
worrin
us
leave
yes
we
got
behind
on
the
rent
mumsey
bein
sick
so
and
not
anythin
in
spite
of
a
courageously
cheerful
smile
jamie
voice
shook
mis
dolan
the
woman
what
keeps
my
wheel
chair
for
me
you
know
is
helpin
us
out
this
week
but
of
course
she
do
it
always
and
then
we
have
to
go
if
jerry
do
strike
it
rich
or
somethin
oh
but
ca
we
began
pollyanna
she
stopped
short
carew
had
risen
to
her
feet
abruptly
with
a
hurried
come
pollyanna
we
must
go
then
to
the
woman
she
turned
wearily
you
wo
have
to
leave
i
send
you
money
and
food
at
once
and
i
mention
your
case
to
one
of
the
charity
organizations
in
which
i
am
interested
and
they
will
in
surprise
she
ceased
speaking
the
bent
little
figure
of
the
woman
opposite
had
drawn
itself
almost
erect
murphy
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
showed
a
smouldering
fire
thank
you
no
carew
she
said
tremulously
but
proudly
poor
god
knows
but
we
ai
charity
folks
nonsense
cried
carew
sharply
you
letting
the
woman
help
you
this
boy
said
so
i
know
but
that
ai
charity
persisted
the
woman
still
tremulously
dolan
is
my
friend
she
knows
i
do
her
a
good
turn
just
as
quick
i
have
done
for
her
in
times
past
help
from
friends
ai
charity
they
care
and
that
that
makes
a
difference
we
always
as
we
are
now
you
see
and
that
makes
it
hurt
all
the
more
all
this
thank
you
but
we
could
take
your
money
carew
frowned
angrily
it
had
been
a
most
disappointing
exhausting
hour
for
her
never
a
patient
woman
she
was
exasperated
now
besides
being
utterly
tired
out
very
well
just
as
you
please
she
said
coldly
then
with
vague
irritation
she
added
but
why
do
you
go
to
your
landlord
and
insist
that
he
make
you
even
decently
comfortable
while
you
do
stay
surely
you
entitled
to
something
besides
broken
windows
stuffed
with
rags
and
papers
and
those
stairs
that
i
came
up
are
positively
dangerous
murphy
sighed
in
a
discouraged
way
her
twisted
little
figure
had
fallen
back
into
its
old
hopelessness
we
have
tried
to
have
something
done
but
it
never
amounted
to
anything
we
never
see
anybody
but
the
agent
of
course
and
he
says
the
rents
are
too
low
for
the
owner
to
put
out
any
more
money
on
repairs
nonsense
snapped
carew
with
all
the
sharpness
of
a
nervous
distraught
woman
who
has
at
last
found
an
outlet
for
her
exasperation
it
shameful
what
more
i
think
it
a
clear
case
of
violation
of
the
law
those
stairs
are
certainly
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
see
that
he
brought
to
terms
what
is
the
name
of
that
agent
and
who
is
the
owner
of
this
delectable
establishment
i
do
know
the
name
of
the
owner
madam
but
the
agent
is
mr
dodge
dodge
carew
turned
sharply
an
odd
look
on
her
face
you
do
mean
henry
dodge
yes
madam
his
name
is
henry
i
think
a
flood
of
color
swept
into
carew
face
then
receded
leaving
it
whiter
than
before
very
well
i
i
attend
to
it
she
murmured
in
a
voice
turning
away
come
pollyanna
we
must
go
now
over
at
the
bed
pollyanna
was
bidding
jamie
a
tearful
but
i
come
again
i
come
real
soon
she
promised
brightly
as
she
hurried
through
the
door
after
carew
not
until
they
had
picked
their
precarious
way
down
the
three
long
flights
of
stairs
and
through
the
jabbering
gesticulating
crowd
of
men
women
and
children
that
surrounded
the
scowling
perkins
and
the
limousine
did
pollyanna
speak
again
but
then
she
scarcely
waited
for
the
irate
chauffeur
to
slam
the
door
upon
them
before
she
pleaded
dear
carew
please
please
say
that
it
was
jamie
oh
it
would
be
so
nice
for
him
to
be
jamie
but
he
is
jamie
o
dear
are
you
sure
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
carew
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
no
i
not
sure
and
that
the
tragedy
of
it
she
moaned
i
think
he
is
i
almost
positive
he
is
but
of
course
there
is
a
chance
and
that
what
killing
me
then
ca
you
just
think
he
jamie
begged
pollyanna
and
play
he
was
then
you
could
take
him
home
and
but
carew
turned
fiercely
take
that
boy
into
my
home
when
he
was
jamie
never
pollyanna
i
could
but
if
you
ca
help
jamie
i
should
think
you
be
so
glad
there
was
some
one
like
him
you
could
help
urged
pollyanna
tremulously
what
if
your
jamie
was
like
this
jamie
all
poor
and
sick
you
want
some
one
to
take
him
in
and
comfort
him
and
do
do
pollyanna
moaned
carew
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
frenzy
of
grief
when
i
think
that
maybe
somewhere
our
jamie
is
like
that
only
a
choking
sob
finished
the
sentence
that
just
what
i
mean
that
just
what
i
mean
triumphed
pollyanna
excitedly
do
you
see
if
this
is
your
jamie
of
course
you
want
him
and
if
it
is
you
could
be
doing
any
harm
to
the
other
jamie
by
taking
this
one
and
you
do
a
whole
lot
of
good
for
you
make
this
one
so
happy
so
happy
and
then
by
and
by
if
you
should
find
the
real
jamie
you
would
have
lost
anything
but
you
have
made
two
little
boys
happy
instead
of
one
and
but
again
carew
interrupted
her
do
pollyanna
do
i
want
to
think
i
want
to
think
tearfully
pollyanna
sat
back
in
her
seat
by
a
very
visible
effort
she
kept
still
for
one
whole
minute
then
as
if
the
words
fairly
bubbled
forth
of
themselves
there
came
this
oh
but
what
an
awful
awful
place
that
was
i
just
wish
the
man
that
owned
it
had
to
live
in
it
himself
and
then
see
what
he
have
to
be
glad
for
carew
sat
suddenly
erect
her
face
showed
a
curious
change
almost
as
if
in
appeal
she
flung
out
her
hand
toward
pollyanna
do
she
cried
perhaps
she
did
know
pollyanna
perhaps
she
did
know
i
sure
she
did
know
she
owned
a
place
like
that
but
it
will
be
fixed
now
it
will
be
fixed
she
is
it
a
woman
that
owns
it
and
do
you
know
her
and
do
you
know
the
agent
too
yes
carew
bit
her
lips
i
know
her
and
i
know
the
agent
oh
i
so
glad
sighed
pollyanna
then
it
be
all
right
now
well
it
certainly
will
be
better
avowed
carew
with
emphasis
as
the
car
stopped
before
her
own
door
carew
spoke
as
if
she
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
and
perhaps
indeed
she
did
better
than
she
cared
to
tell
pollyanna
certainly
before
she
slept
that
night
a
letter
left
her
hands
addressed
to
one
henry
dodge
summoning
him
to
an
immediate
conference
as
to
certain
changes
and
repairs
to
be
made
at
once
in
tenements
she
owned
there
were
moreover
several
scathing
sentences
concerning
windows
and
rickety
stairways
that
caused
this
same
henry
dodge
to
scowl
angrily
and
to
say
a
sharp
word
behind
his
teeth
though
at
the
same
time
he
paled
with
something
very
like
fear
chapter
xi
a
surprise
for
carew
the
matter
of
repairs
and
improvements
having
been
properly
and
efficiently
attended
to
carew
told
herself
that
she
had
done
her
duty
and
that
the
matter
was
closed
she
would
forget
it
the
boy
was
not
jamie
he
could
not
be
jamie
that
ignorant
sickly
crippled
boy
her
dead
sister
son
impossible
she
would
cast
the
whole
thing
from
her
thoughts
it
was
just
here
however
that
carew
found
herself
against
an
immovable
impassable
barrier
the
whole
thing
refused
to
be
cast
from
her
thoughts
always
before
her
eyes
was
the
picture
of
that
bare
little
room
and
the
boy
always
in
her
ears
was
that
heartbreaking
what
if
it
were
jamie
and
always
too
there
was
pollyanna
for
even
though
carew
might
as
she
did
silence
the
pleadings
and
questionings
of
the
little
girl
tongue
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
prayers
and
reproaches
of
the
little
eyes
twice
again
in
desperation
carew
went
to
see
the
boy
telling
herself
each
time
that
only
another
visit
was
needed
to
convince
her
that
the
boy
was
not
the
one
she
sought
but
even
though
while
there
in
the
boy
presence
she
told
herself
that
she
was
convinced
once
away
from
it
the
old
old
questioning
returned
at
last
in
still
greater
desperation
she
wrote
to
her
sister
and
told
her
the
whole
story
i
had
not
meant
to
tell
you
she
wrote
after
she
had
stated
the
bare
facts
of
the
case
i
thought
it
a
pity
to
harrow
you
up
or
to
raise
false
hopes
i
am
so
sure
it
is
not
he
and
yet
even
as
i
write
these
words
i
know
i
am
not
sure
that
is
why
i
want
you
to
come
why
you
must
come
i
must
have
you
see
him
i
wonder
oh
i
wonder
what
you
say
of
course
we
have
seen
our
jamie
since
he
was
four
years
old
he
would
be
twelve
now
this
boy
is
twelve
i
should
judge
he
does
know
his
age
he
has
hair
and
eyes
not
unlike
our
jamie
he
is
crippled
but
that
condition
came
upon
him
through
a
fall
six
years
ago
and
was
made
worse
through
another
one
four
years
later
anything
like
a
complete
description
of
his
father
appearance
seems
impossible
to
obtain
but
what
i
have
learned
contains
nothing
conclusive
either
for
or
against
his
being
poor
doris
husband
he
was
called
professor
was
very
queer
and
seemed
to
own
nothing
save
a
few
books
this
might
or
might
not
signify
john
kent
was
certainly
always
queer
and
a
good
deal
of
a
bohemian
in
his
tastes
whether
he
cared
for
books
or
not
i
remember
do
you
and
of
course
the
title
might
easily
have
been
assumed
if
he
wished
or
it
might
have
been
merely
given
him
by
others
as
for
this
boy
i
do
know
i
do
know
but
i
do
hope
you
will
your
distracted
sister
ruth
della
came
at
once
and
she
went
immediately
to
see
the
boy
but
she
did
not
know
like
her
sister
she
said
she
did
not
think
it
was
their
jamie
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
that
chance
it
might
be
he
after
all
like
pollyanna
however
she
had
what
she
thought
was
a
very
satisfactory
way
out
of
the
dilemma
but
why
do
you
take
him
dear
she
proposed
to
her
sister
why
do
you
take
him
and
adopt
him
it
would
be
lovely
for
him
poor
little
fellow
and
but
carew
shuddered
and
would
not
even
let
her
finish
no
no
i
ca
i
ca
she
moaned
i
want
my
jamie
my
own
jamie
or
no
one
and
with
a
sigh
della
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
her
nursing
if
carew
thought
that
this
closed
the
matter
however
she
was
again
mistaken
for
her
days
were
still
restless
and
her
nights
were
still
either
sleepless
or
filled
with
dreams
of
a
may
be
or
a
might
be
masquerading
as
an
it
is
so
she
was
moreover
having
a
difficult
time
with
pollyanna
pollyanna
was
puzzled
she
was
filled
with
questionings
and
unrest
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
pollyanna
had
come
face
to
face
with
real
poverty
she
knew
people
who
did
not
have
enough
to
eat
who
wore
ragged
clothing
and
who
lived
in
dark
dirty
and
very
tiny
rooms
her
first
impulse
of
course
had
been
to
help
with
carew
she
made
two
visits
to
jamie
and
greatly
did
she
rejoice
at
the
changed
conditions
she
found
there
after
that
man
dodge
had
tended
to
things
but
this
to
pollyanna
was
a
mere
drop
in
the
bucket
there
were
yet
all
those
other
men
women
and
ragged
children
out
in
the
street
jamie
neighbors
confidently
she
looked
to
carew
for
help
for
them
also
indeed
exclaimed
carew
when
she
learned
what
was
expected
of
her
so
you
want
the
whole
street
to
be
supplied
with
fresh
paper
paint
and
new
stairways
do
you
pray
is
there
anything
else
like
oh
yes
lots
of
things
sighed
pollyanna
happily
you
see
there
are
so
many
things
they
need
all
of
them
and
what
fun
it
will
be
to
get
them
how
i
wish
i
was
rich
so
i
could
help
too
but
i
as
glad
to
be
with
you
when
you
get
them
carew
quite
gasped
aloud
in
her
amazement
she
lost
no
time
though
she
did
lose
not
a
little
patience
in
explaining
that
she
had
no
intention
of
doing
anything
further
in
murphy
alley
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
no
one
would
expect
her
to
she
had
canceled
all
possible
obligations
and
had
even
been
really
very
generous
any
one
would
say
in
what
she
had
done
for
the
tenement
where
lived
jamie
and
the
murphys
that
she
owned
the
tenement
building
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
state
at
some
length
she
explained
to
pollyanna
that
there
were
charitable
institutions
both
numerous
and
efficient
whose
business
it
was
to
aid
all
the
worthy
poor
and
that
to
these
institutions
she
gave
frequently
and
liberally
even
then
however
pollyanna
was
not
convinced
but
i
do
see
she
argued
why
it
any
better
or
even
so
nice
for
a
whole
lot
of
folks
to
club
together
and
do
what
everybody
would
like
to
do
for
themselves
i
sure
i
much
rather
give
jamie
a
a
nice
book
now
than
to
have
some
old
society
do
it
and
i
know
like
better
to
have
me
do
it
too
very
likely
returned
carew
with
some
weariness
and
a
little
exasperation
but
it
is
just
possible
that
it
would
not
be
so
well
for
jamie
as
as
if
that
book
were
given
by
a
body
of
people
who
knew
what
sort
of
one
to
select
this
led
her
to
say
much
also
none
of
which
pollyanna
in
the
least
understood
about
pauperizing
the
poor
the
evils
of
indiscriminate
giving
and
the
pernicious
effect
of
unorganized
charity
besides
she
added
in
answer
to
the
still
perplexed
expression
on
pollyanna
worried
little
face
very
likely
if
i
offered
help
to
these
people
they
would
not
take
it
you
remember
murphy
declined
at
the
first
to
let
me
send
food
and
clothing
though
they
accepted
it
readily
enough
from
their
neighbors
on
the
first
floor
it
seems
yes
i
know
sighed
pollyanna
turning
away
there
something
there
somehow
that
i
do
understand
but
it
does
seem
right
that
we
should
have
such
a
lot
of
nice
things
and
that
they
should
have
anything
hardly
as
the
days
passed
this
feeling
on
the
part
of
pollyanna
increased
rather
than
diminished
and
the
questions
she
asked
and
the
comments
she
made
were
anything
but
a
relief
to
the
state
of
mind
in
which
carew
herself
was
even
the
test
of
the
glad
game
in
this
case
pollyanna
was
finding
to
be
very
near
a
failure
for
as
she
expressed
it
i
do
see
how
you
can
find
anything
about
this
business
to
be
glad
for
of
course
we
can
be
glad
for
ourselves
that
we
poor
like
them
but
whenever
i
thinking
how
glad
i
am
for
that
i
get
so
sorry
for
them
that
i
ca
be
glad
any
longer
of
course
we
could
be
glad
there
were
poor
folks
because
we
could
help
them
but
if
we
do
help
them
where
the
glad
part
of
that
coming
in
and
to
this
pollyanna
could
find
no
one
who
could
give
her
a
satisfactory
answer
especially
she
asked
this
question
of
carew
and
carew
still
haunted
by
the
visions
of
the
jamie
that
was
and
the
jamie
that
might
be
grew
only
more
restless
more
wretched
and
more
utterly
despairing
nor
was
she
helped
any
by
the
approach
of
christmas
nowhere
was
there
glow
of
holly
or
flash
of
tinsel
that
did
not
carry
its
pang
to
her
for
always
to
carew
it
but
symbolized
a
empty
stocking
a
stocking
that
might
be
jamie
finally
a
week
before
christmas
she
fought
what
she
thought
was
the
last
battle
with
herself
resolutely
but
with
no
real
joy
in
her
face
she
gave
terse
orders
to
mary
and
summoned
pollyanna
pollyanna
she
began
almost
harshly
i
have
decided
to
to
take
jamie
the
car
will
be
here
at
once
i
going
after
him
now
and
bring
him
home
you
may
come
with
me
if
you
like
a
great
light
transfigured
pollyanna
face
oh
oh
oh
how
glad
i
am
she
breathed
why
i
so
glad
i
i
want
to
cry
carew
why
is
it
when
you
the
very
gladdest
of
anything
you
always
want
to
cry
i
do
know
i
sure
pollyanna
rejoined
carew
abstractedly
on
carew
face
there
was
still
no
look
of
joy
once
in
the
murphys
little
tenement
it
did
not
take
carew
long
to
tell
her
errand
in
a
few
short
sentences
she
told
the
story
of
the
lost
jamie
and
of
her
first
hopes
that
this
jamie
might
be
he
she
made
no
secret
of
her
doubts
that
he
was
the
one
at
the
same
time
she
said
she
had
decided
to
take
him
home
with
her
and
give
him
every
possible
advantage
then
a
little
wearily
she
told
what
were
the
plans
she
had
made
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
murphy
listened
crying
softly
across
the
room
jerry
murphy
his
eyes
dilating
emitted
an
occasional
low
gee
can
ye
beat
that
now
as
to
jamie
jamie
on
the
bed
had
listened
at
first
with
the
air
of
one
to
whom
suddenly
a
door
has
opened
into
a
paradise
but
gradually
as
carew
talked
a
new
look
came
to
his
eyes
very
slowly
he
closed
them
and
turned
away
his
face
when
carew
ceased
speaking
there
was
a
long
silence
before
jamie
turned
his
head
and
answered
they
saw
then
that
his
face
was
very
white
and
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
thank
you
carew
but
i
ca
go
he
said
simply
you
ca
what
cried
carew
as
if
she
doubted
the
evidence
of
her
own
ears
jamie
gasped
pollyanna
oh
come
kid
what
eatin
ye
scowled
jerry
hurriedly
coming
forward
do
ye
know
a
good
thing
when
ye
see
it
yes
but
i
ca
go
said
the
crippled
boy
again
but
jamie
jamie
think
think
what
it
would
mean
to
you
quavered
murphy
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
am
choked
jamie
do
you
suppose
i
know
what
doin
what
i
givin
up
then
to
carew
he
turned
eyes
i
ca
he
faltered
i
ca
let
you
do
all
that
for
me
if
you
cared
it
would
be
different
but
you
do
care
not
really
you
do
want
me
not
me
you
want
the
real
jamie
and
i
ai
the
real
jamie
you
do
think
i
am
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
i
know
but
but
began
carew
helplessly
and
it
is
as
if
as
if
i
was
like
other
boys
and
could
walk
either
interrupted
the
cripple
feverishly
you
get
tired
of
me
in
no
time
and
i
see
it
comin
i
could
stand
it
to
be
a
burden
like
that
of
course
if
you
cared
like
mumsey
here
he
threw
out
his
hand
choked
back
a
sob
then
turned
his
head
away
again
i
not
the
jamie
you
want
i
ca
go
he
said
with
the
words
his
thin
boyish
hand
fell
clenched
till
the
knuckles
showed
white
against
the
tattered
old
shawl
that
covered
the
bed
there
was
a
moment
breathless
hush
then
very
quietly
carew
got
to
her
feet
her
face
was
colorless
but
there
was
that
in
it
that
silenced
the
sob
that
rose
to
pollyanna
lips
come
pollyanna
was
all
she
said
well
if
you
ai
the
fool
limit
babbled
jerry
murphy
to
the
boy
on
the
bed
as
the
door
closed
a
moment
later
but
the
boy
on
the
bed
was
crying
very
much
as
if
the
closing
door
had
been
the
one
that
had
led
to
paradise
and
that
had
closed
now
forever
chapter
xii
from
behind
a
counter
carew
was
very
angry
to
have
brought
herself
to
the
point
where
she
was
willing
to
take
this
lame
boy
into
her
home
and
then
to
have
the
lad
calmly
refuse
to
come
was
unbearable
carew
was
not
in
the
habit
of
having
her
invitations
ignored
or
her
wishes
scorned
furthermore
now
that
she
could
not
have
the
boy
she
was
conscious
of
an
almost
frantic
terror
lest
he
were
after
all
the
real
jamie
she
knew
then
that
her
true
reason
for
wanting
him
had
been
not
because
she
cared
for
him
not
even
because
she
wished
to
help
him
and
make
him
happy
but
because
she
hoped
by
taking
him
that
she
would
ease
her
own
mind
and
forever
silence
that
awful
eternal
questioning
on
her
part
what
if
he
were
her
own
jamie
it
certainly
had
not
helped
matters
any
that
the
boy
had
divined
her
state
of
mind
and
had
given
as
the
reason
for
his
refusal
that
she
did
not
care
to
be
sure
carew
now
very
proudly
told
herself
that
she
did
not
indeed
care
that
he
was
not
her
sister
boy
and
that
she
would
forget
all
about
it
but
she
did
not
forget
all
about
it
however
insistently
she
might
disclaim
responsibility
and
relationship
just
as
insistently
responsibility
and
relationship
thrust
themselves
upon
her
in
the
shape
of
panicky
doubts
and
however
resolutely
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
other
matters
just
so
resolutely
visions
of
a
boy
in
a
room
loomed
always
before
her
then
too
there
was
pollyanna
clearly
pollyanna
was
not
herself
at
all
in
a
most
spirit
she
moped
about
the
house
finding
apparently
no
interest
anywhere
oh
no
i
not
sick
she
would
answer
when
remonstrated
with
and
questioned
but
what
is
the
trouble
why
nothing
it
it
only
that
i
was
thinking
of
jamie
you
know
how
he
has
got
all
these
beautiful
things
carpets
and
pictures
and
curtains
it
was
the
same
with
her
food
pollyanna
was
actually
losing
her
appetite
but
here
again
she
disclaimed
sickness
oh
no
she
would
sigh
mournfully
it
just
that
i
do
seem
hungry
some
way
just
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
eat
i
think
of
jamie
and
how
he
does
have
only
old
doughnuts
and
dry
rolls
and
then
i
i
do
want
anything
carew
spurred
by
a
feeling
that
she
herself
only
dimly
understood
and
recklessly
determined
to
bring
about
some
change
in
pollyanna
at
all
costs
ordered
a
huge
tree
two
dozen
wreaths
and
quantities
of
holly
and
christmas
baubles
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
the
house
was
aflame
and
aglitter
with
scarlet
and
tinsel
there
was
even
to
be
a
christmas
party
for
carew
had
told
pollyanna
to
invite
half
a
dozen
of
her
schoolgirl
friends
for
the
tree
on
christmas
eve
but
even
here
carew
met
with
disappointment
for
though
pollyanna
was
always
grateful
and
at
times
interested
and
even
excited
she
still
carried
frequently
a
sober
little
face
and
in
the
end
the
christmas
party
was
more
of
a
sorrow
than
a
joy
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
glittering
tree
sent
her
into
a
storm
of
sobs
why
pollyanna
ejaculated
carew
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
now
wept
pollyanna
it
only
that
it
so
perfectly
perfectly
beautiful
that
i
just
had
to
cry
i
was
thinking
how
jamie
would
love
to
see
it
it
was
then
that
carew
patience
snapped
jamie
jamie
she
exclaimed
pollyanna
ca
you
stop
talking
about
that
boy
you
know
perfectly
well
that
it
is
not
my
fault
that
he
is
not
here
i
asked
him
to
come
here
to
live
besides
where
is
that
glad
game
of
yours
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
idea
if
you
would
play
it
on
this
i
am
playing
it
quavered
pollyanna
and
that
what
i
understand
i
never
knew
it
to
act
so
funny
why
before
when
been
glad
about
things
i
been
happy
but
now
about
jamie
i
so
glad
i
got
carpets
and
pictures
and
nice
things
to
eat
and
that
i
can
walk
and
run
and
go
to
school
and
all
that
but
the
harder
glad
for
myself
the
sorrier
i
am
for
him
i
never
knew
the
game
to
act
so
funny
and
i
do
know
what
ails
it
do
you
but
carew
with
a
despairing
gesture
merely
turned
away
without
a
word
it
was
the
day
after
christmas
that
something
so
wonderful
happened
that
pollyanna
for
a
time
almost
forgot
jamie
carew
had
taken
her
shopping
and
it
was
while
carew
was
trying
to
decide
between
a
and
a
collar
that
pollyanna
chanced
to
spy
farther
down
the
counter
a
face
that
looked
vaguely
familiar
for
a
moment
she
regarded
it
frowningly
then
with
a
little
cry
she
ran
down
the
aisle
oh
it
you
it
is
you
she
exclaimed
joyously
to
a
girl
who
was
putting
into
the
show
case
a
tray
of
pink
bows
i
so
glad
to
see
you
the
girl
behind
the
counter
lifted
her
head
and
stared
at
pollyanna
in
amazement
but
almost
immediately
her
dark
somber
face
lighted
with
a
smile
of
glad
recognition
well
well
if
it
is
my
little
public
garden
kiddie
she
ejaculated
yes
i
so
glad
you
remembered
beamed
pollyanna
but
you
never
came
again
i
looked
for
you
lots
of
times
i
could
i
had
to
work
that
was
our
last
and
fifty
cents
madam
she
broke
off
in
answer
to
a
old
question
as
to
the
price
of
a
bow
on
the
counter
fifty
cents
the
old
lady
fingered
the
bow
hesitated
then
laid
it
down
with
a
sigh
hm
yes
well
it
very
pretty
i
sure
my
dear
she
said
as
she
passed
on
immediately
behind
her
came
two
girls
who
with
much
giggling
and
bantering
picked
out
a
jeweled
creation
of
scarlet
velvet
and
a
structure
of
tulle
and
pink
buds
as
the
girls
turned
chattering
away
pollyanna
drew
an
ecstatic
sigh
is
this
what
you
do
all
day
my
how
glad
you
must
be
you
chose
this
glad
yes
it
must
be
such
fun
such
lots
of
folks

and
all
different
and

talk
to

to
talk
to

think

this
when
i
grow
up

must
be
such
fun
to
see
what
they
all
buy

glad
bristled
the
girl
behind
the
counter
well
child
i
guess
if
you
knew
half
that
a
dollar
madam
she
interrupted
herself
hastily
in
answer
to
a
young
woman
sharp
question
as
to
the
price
of
a
flaring
yellow
bow
of
beaded
velvet
in
the
show
case
well
i
should
think
was
time
you
told
me
snapped
the
young
woman
i
had
to
ask
you
twice
the
girl
behind
the
counter
bit
her
lip
i
did
hear
you
madam
i
ca
help
that
it
is
your
business
to
hear
you
are
paid
for
it

you
how
much
is
that
black
one
fifty
cents
and
that
blue
one
one
dollar
no
impudence
miss
you
need
be
so
short
about
it
or
i
shall
report
you
let
me
see
that
tray
of
pink
ones
the
salesgirl
lips
opened
then
closed
in
a
thin
straight
line
obediently
she
reached
into
the
show
case
and
took
out
the
tray
of
pink
bows
but
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
hands
shook
visibly
as
she
set
the
tray
down
on
the
counter
the
young
woman
whom
she
was
serving
picked
up
five
bows
asked
the
price
of
four
of
them
then
turned
away
with
a
brief
i
see
nothing
i
care
for
well
said
the
girl
behind
the
counter
in
a
shaking
voice
to
the
pollyanna
what
do
you
think
of
my
business
now
anything
to
be
glad
about
there
pollyanna
giggled
a
little
hysterically
my
was
she
cross
but
she
was
kind
of
funny
too
do
you
think
anyhow
you
can
be
glad
that
that
they
are
all
like
her
ca
you
i
suppose
so
said
the
girl
with
a
faint
smile
but
i
can
tell
you
right
now
kiddie
that
glad
game
of
yours
you
was
tellin
me
about
that
day
in
the
garden
may
be
all
very
well
for
you
but
once
more
she
stopped
with
a
tired
fifty
cents
madam
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
other
side
of
the
counter
are
you
as
lonesome
as
ever
asked
pollyanna
wistfully
when
the
salesgirl
was
at
liberty
again
well
i
ca
say
i
given
five
parties
nor
been
to
seven
since
i
saw
you
replied
the
girl
so
bitterly
that
pollyanna
detected
the
sarcasm
oh
but
you
did
something
nice
christmas
did
you
oh
yes
i
stayed
in
bed
all
day
with
my
feet
done
up
in
rags
and
read
four
newspapers
and
one
magazine
then
at
night
i
hobbled
out
to
a
restaurant
where
i
had
to
blow
in
cents
for
chicken
pie
instead
of
a
quarter
but
what
ailed
your
feet
blistered
standin
on
christmas
rush
oh
shuddered
pollyanna
sympathetically
and
you
did
have
any
tree
or
party
or
anything
she
cried
distressed
and
shocked
well
hardly
o
dear
how
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
mine
sighed
the
little
girl
it
was
just
lovely
and
but
oh
say
she
exclaimed
joyously
you
can
see
it
after
all
it
is
gone
yet
now
ca
you
come
out
or
night
and
pollyanna
interrupted
carew
in
her
chilliest
accents
what
in
the
world
does
this
mean
where
have
you
been
i
have
looked
everywhere
for
you
i
even
went
back
to
the

pollyanna
turned
with
a
happy
little
cry
oh
carew
i
so
glad
you
come
she
rejoiced
this
is
well
i
do
know
her
name
yet
but
i
know
her
so
it
all
right
i
met
her
in
the
public
garden
ever
so
long
ago
and
lonesome
and
does
know
anybody
and
her
father
was
a
minister
like
mine
only
he
alive
and
she
did
have
any
christmas
tree
only
blistered
feet
and
chicken
pie
and
i
want
her
to
see
mine
you
know
the
tree
i
mean
plunged
on
pollyanna
breathlessly
asked
her
to
come
out
or
night
and
you
let
me
have
it
all
lighted
up
again
wo
you
illustration
do
know
her
name
yet
but
i
know
her
so
all
right
well
really
pollyanna
began
carew
in
cold
disapproval
but
the
girl
behind
the
counter
interrupted
with
a
voice
quite
as
cold
and
even
more
disapproving
do
worry
madam
i
no
notion
of
goin
oh
but
please
begged
pollyanna
you
do
know
how
i
want
you
and
i
notice
the
lady
ai
doin
any
askin
interrupted
the
salesgirl
a
little
maliciously
carew
flushed
an
angry
red
and
turned
as
if
to
go
but
pollyanna
caught
her
arm
and
held
it
talking
meanwhile
almost
frenziedly
to
the
girl
behind
the
counter
who
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
free
from
customers
oh
but
she
will
she
will
pollyanna
was
saying
she
wants
you
to
come
i
know
she
does
why
you
do
know
how
good
she
is
and
how
much
money
she
gives
to
to
charitable
and
everything
pollyanna
remonstrated
carew
sharply
once
more
she
would
have
gone
but
this
time
she
was
held
spellbound
by
the
ringing
scorn
in
the
low
tense
voice
of
the
salesgirl
oh
yes
i
know
there
lots
of
that
give
to
rescue
work
there
always
plenty
of
helpin
hands
stretched
out
to
them
that
has
gone
wrong
and
that
all
right
i
ai
findin
no
fault
with
that
only
sometimes
i
wonder
there
do
some
of
think
of
helpin
the
girls
before
they
go
wrong
why
do
they
give
good
girls
pretty
homes
with
books
and
pictures
and
soft
carpets
and
music
and
somebody
to
care
maybe
then
there
would
be
so
many
good
heavens
what
am
i
sayin
she
broke
off
under
her
breath
then
with
the
old
weariness
she
turned
to
a
young
woman
who
had
stopped
before
her
and
picked
up
a
blue
bow
that
fifty
cents
madam
carew
heard
as
she
hurried
pollyanna
away
chapter
xiii
a
waiting
and
a
winning
it
was
a
delightful
plan
pollyanna
had
it
entirely
formulated
in
about
five
minutes
then
she
told
carew
carew
did
not
think
it
was
a
delightful
plan
and
she
said
so
very
distinctly
oh
but
i
sure
they
think
it
is
argued
pollyanna
in
reply
to
carew
objections
and
just
think
how
easy
we
can
do
it
the
tree
is
just
as
it
was
except
for
the
presents
and
we
can
get
more
of
those
it
wo
be
so
very
long
till
just
new
year
eve
and
only
think
how
glad
she
be
to
come
would
you
be
if
you
had
had
anything
for
christmas
only
blistered
feet
and
chicken
pie
dear
dear
what
an
impossible
child
you
are
frowned
carew
even
yet
it
does
seem
to
occur
to
you
that
we
do
know
this
young
person
name
so
we
do
and
is
it
funny
when
i
feel
that
i
know
her
so
well
smiled
pollyanna
you
see
we
had
such
a
good
talk
in
the
garden
that
day
and
she
told
me
all
about
how
lonesome
she
was
and
that
she
thought
the
lonesomest
place
in
the
world
was
in
a
crowd
in
a
big
city
because
folks
did
think
nor
notice
oh
there
was
one
that
noticed
but
he
noticed
too
much
she
said
and
he
had
ought
to
notice
her
any
which
is
kind
of
funny
is
it
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
but
anyhow
he
came
for
her
there
in
the
garden
to
go
somewhere
with
him
and
she
would
go
and
he
was
a
real
handsome
gentleman
too
until
he
began
to
look
so
cross
just
at
the
last
folks
are
so
pretty
when
they
cross
are
they
now
there
was
a
lady
looking
at
bows
and
she
said
well
lots
of
things
that
were
nice
you
know
and
she
did
look
pretty
either
after
after
she
began
to
talk
but
you
will
let
me
have
the
tree
new
year
eve
wo
you
mrs
carew
and
invite
this
girl
who
sells
bows
and
jamie
he
better
you
know
now
and
he
could
come
of
course
jerry
would
have
to
wheel
him
but
then
we
want
jerry
anyway
oh
of
course
jerry
exclaimed
carew
in
ironic
scorn
but
why
stop
with
jerry
i
sure
jerry
has
hosts
of
friends
who
would
love
to
come
and
oh
carew
may
i
broke
in
pollyanna
in
uncontrollable
delight
oh
how
good
good
good
you
are
i
so
wanted
but
carew
fairly
gasped
aloud
in
surprise
and
dismay
no
no
pollyanna
i
she
began
protestingly
but
pollyanna
entirely
mistaking
the
meaning
of
her
interruption
plunged
in
again
in
stout
championship
indeed
you
are
good
just
the
bestest
ever
and
i
let
you
say
you
are
now
i
reckon
i
have
a
party
all
right
there
tommy
dolan
and
his
sister
jennie
and
the
two
macdonald
children
and
three
girls
whose
names
i
do
know
that
live
under
the
murphys
and
a
whole
lot
more
if
we
have
room
for
and
only
think
how
glad
they
be
when
i
tell
why
carew
seems
to
me
as
if
i
never
knew
anything
so
perfectly
lovely
in
all
my
life
and
it
all
your
doings
now
may
i
begin
right
away
to
invite
so
they
know
what
coming
to
and
carew
who
would
not
have
believed
such
a
thing
possible
heard
herself
murmuring
a
faint
yes
which
she
knew
bound
her
to
the
giving
of
a
party
on
new
year
eve
to
a
dozen
children
from
murphy
alley
and
a
young
salesgirl
whose
name
she
did
not
know
perhaps
in
carew
memory
was
still
lingering
a
young
sometimes
i
wonder
there
do
some
of
think
of
helpin
the
girls
before
they
go
wrong
perhaps
in
her
ears
was
still
ringing
pollyanna
story
of
that
same
girl
who
had
found
a
crowd
in
a
big
city
the
loneliest
place
in
the
world
yet
who
had
refused
to
go
with
the
handsome
man
that
had
noticed
too
much
perhaps
in
heart
was
the
undefined
hope
that
somewhere
in
it
all
lay
the
peace
she
had
so
longed
for
perhaps
it
was
a
little
of
all
three
combined
with
utter
helplessness
in
the
face
of
pollyanna
amazing
twisting
of
her
irritated
sarcasm
into
the
hospitality
of
a
willing
hostess
whatever
it
was
the
thing
was
done
and
at
once
carew
found
herself
caught
into
a
veritable
whirl
of
plans
and
plottings
the
center
of
which
was
always
pollyanna
and
the
party
to
her
sister
carew
wrote
distractedly
of
the
whole
affair
closing
with
what
i
going
to
do
i
do
know
but
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
keep
right
on
doing
as
i
am
doing
there
is
no
other
way
of
course
if
pollyanna
once
begins
to
preach
but
she
has
yet
so
i
ca
with
a
clear
conscience
send
her
back
to
you
della
reading
this
letter
at
the
sanatorium
laughed
aloud
at
the
conclusion
preached
yet
indeed
she
chuckled
to
herself
bless
her
dear
heart
and
yet
you
ruth
carew
own
up
to
giving
two
parties
within
a
week
and
as
i
happen
to
know
your
home
which
used
to
be
shrouded
in
gloom
is
aflame
with
scarlet
and
green
from
top
to
toe
but
she
has
preached
yet
oh
no
she
has
preached
yet
the
party
was
a
great
success
even
carew
admitted
that
jamie
in
his
wheel
chair
jerry
with
his
startling
but
expressive
vocabulary
and
the
girl
whose
name
proved
to
be
sadie
dean
vied
with
each
other
in
amusing
the
more
diffident
guests
sadie
dean
much
to
the
others
surprise
and
perhaps
to
her
own
disclosed
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
most
fascinating
games
and
these
games
with
stories
and
jerry
banter
kept
every
one
in
gales
of
laughter
until
supper
and
the
generous
distribution
of
presents
from
the
laden
tree
sent
the
happy
guests
home
with
tired
sighs
of
content
if
jamie
who
with
jerry
was
the
last
to
leave
looked
about
him
a
bit
wistfully
no
one
apparently
noticed
it
yet
carew
when
she
bade
him
said
low
in
his
ear
half
impatiently
half
embarrassedly
well
jamie
have
you
changed
your
mind
about
coming
the
boy
hesitated
a
faint
color
stole
into
his
cheeks
he
turned
and
looked
into
her
eyes
wistfully
searchingly
then
very
slowly
he
shook
his
head
if
it
could
always
be
like
i
could
he
sighed
but
it
would
there
be
and
next
week
and
next
month
and
next
year
comin
and
i
know
before
next
week
that
i
had
oughter
come
if
carew
had
thought
that
the
new
year
eve
party
was
to
end
the
matter
of
pollyanna
efforts
in
behalf
of
sadie
dean
she
was
soon
undeceived
for
the
very
next
morning
pollyanna
began
to
talk
of
her
and
i
so
glad
i
found
her
again
she
prattled
contentedly
even
if
i
have
been
able
to
find
the
real
jamie
for
you
i
found
somebody
else
for
you
to
love
and
of
course
you
love
to
love
her
it
just
another
way
of
loving
jamie
carew
drew
in
her
breath
and
gave
a
little
gasp
of
exasperation
this
unfailing
faith
in
her
goodness
of
heart
and
unhesitating
belief
in
her
desire
to
help
everybody
was
most
disconcerting
and
sometimes
most
annoying
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
most
difficult
thing
to
disclaim
under
the
circumstances
especially
with
pollyanna
happy
confident
eyes
full
on
her
face
but
pollyanna
she
objected
impotently
at
last
feeling
very
much
as
if
she
were
struggling
against
invisible
silken
cords
i
you
this
girl
really
is
jamie
at
all
you
know
i
know
she
is
sympathized
pollyanna
quickly
and
of
course
just
as
sorry
she
is
jamie
as
can
be
but
she
jamie
that
is
i
mean
she
has
got
anybody
down
here
to
love
her
and
and
notice
you
know
and
so
whenever
you
remember
jamie
i
should
think
you
could
be
glad
enough
there
was
somebody
you
could
help
just
as
you
want
folks
to
help
jamie
wherever
he
is
carew
shivered
and
gave
a
little
moan
but
i
want
my
jamie
she
grieved
pollyanna
nodded
with
understanding
eyes
i
know
the
presence
pendleton
told
me
about
it
only
you
got
the
hand
hand
yes
to
make
a
home
you
know
he
said
that
it
took
a
woman
hand
or
a
child
presence
to
make
a
home
that
was
when
he
wanted
me
and
i
found
him
jimmy
and
he
adopted
him
instead
jimmy
carew
looked
up
with
the
startled
something
in
her
eyes
that
always
came
into
them
at
the
mention
of
any
variant
of
that
name
yes
jimmy
bean
oh
bean
said
carew
relaxing
yes
he
was
from
an
orphan
home
and
he
ran
away
i
found
him
he
said
he
wanted
another
kind
of
a
home
with
a
mother
in
it
instead
of
a
matron
i
could
find
him
the
but
i
found
him
pendleton
and
he
adopted
him
his
name
is
jimmy
pendleton
now
but
it
was
bean
yes
it
was
bean
oh
said
carew
this
time
with
a
long
sigh
carew
saw
a
good
deal
of
sadie
dean
during
the
days
that
followed
the
new
year
eve
party
she
saw
a
good
deal
of
jamie
too
in
one
way
and
another
pollyanna
contrived
to
have
them
frequently
at
the
house
and
this
carew
much
to
her
surprise
and
vexation
could
not
seem
to
prevent
her
consent
and
even
her
delight
were
taken
by
pollyanna
as
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
she
found
herself
helpless
to
convince
the
child
that
neither
approval
nor
satisfaction
entered
into
the
matter
at
all
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
but
carew
whether
she
herself
realized
it
or
not
was
learning
many
things
things
she
never
could
have
learned
in
the
old
days
shut
up
in
her
rooms
with
orders
to
mary
to
admit
no
one
she
was
learning
something
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
lonely
young
girl
in
a
big
city
with
one
living
to
earn
and
with
no
one
to
care
except
one
who
cares
too
much
and
too
little
but
what
did
you
mean
she
nervously
asked
sadie
dean
one
evening
what
did
you
mean
that
first
day
in
the
store
what
you
said
about
helping
the
girls
sadie
dean
colored
distressfully
i
afraid
i
was
rude
she
apologized
never
mind
that
tell
me
what
you
meant
i
thought
of
it
so
many
times
since
for
a
moment
the
girl
was
silent
then
a
little
bitterly
she
said
was
because
i
knew
a
girl
once
and
i
was
thinkin
of
her
she
came
from
my
town
and
she
was
pretty
and
good
but
she
over
strong
for
a
year
we
pulled
together
sharin
the
same
room
boiling
our
eggs
over
the
same
and
eatin
our
hash
and
fish
balls
for
supper
at
the
same
cheap
restaurant
there
was
never
anything
to
do
but
to
walk
in
the
common
or
go
to
the
movies
if
we
had
the
dime
to
blow
in
or
just
stay
in
our
room
well
our
room
was
very
pleasant
it
was
hot
in
summer
and
cold
in
winter
and
the
was
so
measly
and
so
flickery
that
we
could
sew
or
read
even
if
we
had
been
too
fagged
out
to
do
either
which
we
generally
was
besides
over
our
heads
was
a
squeaky
board
that
some
one
was
always
rockin
on
and
under
us
was
a
feller
that
was
learnin
to
play
the
cornet
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
learn
to
play
the
cornet
i
do
think
so
murmured
carew
well
you
missed
a
lot
said
the
girl
dryly
then
after
a
moment
she
resumed
her
story
sometimes
at
christmas
and
holidays
we
used
to
walk
up
here
on
the
avenue
and
other
streets
huntin
for
windows
where
the
curtains
were
up
and
we
could
look
in
you
see
we
were
pretty
lonesome
them
days
and
we
said
it
did
us
good
to
see
homes
with
folks
and
lamps
on
the
and
children
games
but
we
both
of
us
knew
that
really
it
only
made
us
feel
worse
than
ever
because
we
were
so
hopelessly
out
of
it
all
was
even
harder
to
see
the
automobiles
and
the
gay
young
folks
in
them
laughing
and
chatting
you
see
we
were
young
and
i
suspect
we
wanted
to
laugh
and
chatter
we
wanted
a
good
time
too
and
by
and
by
my
chum
began
to
have
it
this
good
time
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
we
broke
partnership
one
day
and
she
went
her
way
and
i
mine
i
did
like
the
company
she
was
keepin
and
i
said
so
she
would
give
up
so
we
quit
i
see
her
again
for
two
years
then
i
got
a
note
from
her
and
i
went
this
was
just
last
month
she
was
in
one
of
them
rescue
homes
it
was
a
lovely
place
soft
rugs
fine
pictures
plants
flowers
and
books
a
piano
a
beautiful
room
and
everything
possible
done
for
her
rich
women
came
in
their
automobiles
and
carriages
to
take
her
driving
and
she
was
taken
to
concerts
and
matinees
she
was
stenography
and
they
were
going
to
help
her
to
a
position
just
as
soon
as
she
could
take
it
everybody
was
wonderfully
good
to
her
she
said
and
showed
they
wanted
to
help
her
in
every
way
but
she
said
something
else
too
she
said
if
they
taken
one
half
the
pains
to
show
me
they
cared
and
wanted
to
help
long
ago
when
i
was
an
honest
homesick
girl
i
would
have
been
here
for
them
to
help
now
and
well
i
never
forgot
it
that
all
it
ai
that
objectin
to
the
rescue
work
it
a
fine
thing
and
they
ought
to
do
it
only
i
thinkin
there
would
be
quite
so
much
of
it
for
them
to
do
if
they
just
show
a
little
of
their
interest
earlier
in
the
game
but
i
thought
there
were
homes
and
and
that
that
did
that
sort
of
thing
faltered
carew
in
a
voice
that
few
of
her
friends
would
have
recognized
there
are
did
you
ever
see
the
inside
of
one
of
them
why
though
i
i
have
given
money
to
them
this
time
carew
voice
was
almost
apologetically
pleading
in
tone
sadie
dean
smiled
curiously
yes
i
know
there
are
lots
of
good
women
that
have
given
money
to
them
and
have
never
seen
the
inside
of
one
of
them
please
understand
that
i
sayin
anythin
against
the
homes
i
not
they
good
things
they
almost
the
only
thing
that
doing
anything
to
help
but
they
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
to
what
is
really
needed
i
tried
one
once
but
there
was
an
air
about
it
somehow
i
felt
but
there
what
the
use
probably
they
all
like
that
one
and
maybe
the
fault
was
with
me
if
i
should
try
to
tell
you
you
would
understand
you
have
to
live
in
it
and
you
have
even
seen
the
inside
of
one
but
i
ca
help
sometimes
why
so
many
of
those
good
women
never
seem
to
put
the
real
heart
and
interest
into
the
preventin
that
they
do
into
the
rescuin
but
there
i
did
mean
to
talk
such
a
lot
but
you
asked
me
yes
i
asked
you
said
carew
in
a
voice
as
she
turned
away
not
only
from
sadie
dean
however
was
carew
learning
things
never
learned
before
but
from
jamie
also
jamie
was
there
a
great
deal
pollyanna
liked
to
have
him
there
and
he
liked
to
be
there
at
first
to
be
sure
he
had
hesitated
but
very
soon
he
had
quieted
his
doubts
and
yielded
to
his
longings
by
telling
himself
and
pollyanna
that
after
all
visiting
was
not
staying
for
keeps
carew
often
found
the
boy
and
pollyanna
contentedly
settled
on
the
library
with
the
empty
wheel
chair
close
by
sometimes
they
were
poring
over
a
book
she
heard
jamie
tell
pollyanna
one
day
that
he
did
think
he
mind
so
very
much
being
lame
if
he
had
so
many
books
as
carew
and
that
he
guessed
be
so
happy
he
fly
clean
away
if
he
had
both
books
and
legs
sometimes
the
boy
was
telling
stories
and
pollyanna
was
listening
and
absorbed
carew
wondered
at
pollyanna
interest
until
one
day
she
herself
stopped
and
listened
after
that
she
wondered
no
longer
but
she
listened
a
good
deal
longer
crude
and
incorrect
as
was
much
of
the
boy
language
it
was
always
wonderfully
vivid
and
picturesque
so
that
carew
found
herself
hand
in
hand
with
pollyanna
trailing
down
the
golden
ages
at
the
beck
of
a
boy
dimly
carew
was
beginning
to
realize
too
something
of
what
it
must
mean
to
be
in
spirit
and
ambition
the
center
of
brave
deeds
and
wonderful
adventures
while
in
reality
one
was
only
a
crippled
boy
in
a
wheel
chair
but
what
carew
did
not
realize
was
the
part
this
crippled
boy
was
beginning
to
play
in
her
own
life
she
did
not
realize
how
much
a
matter
of
course
his
presence
was
becoming
nor
how
interested
she
now
was
in
finding
something
new
for
jamie
to
see
neither
did
she
realize
how
day
by
day
he
was
coming
to
seem
to
her
more
and
more
the
lost
jamie
her
dead
sister
child
as
february
march
and
april
passed
however
and
may
came
bringing
with
it
the
near
approach
of
the
date
set
for
pollyanna
carew
did
suddenly
awake
to
the
knowledge
of
what
that
was
to
mean
to
her
she
was
amazed
and
appalled
up
to
now
she
had
in
belief
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
departure
of
pollyanna
she
had
said
that
then
once
again
the
house
would
be
quiet
with
the
glaring
sun
shut
out
once
again
she
would
be
at
peace
and
able
to
hide
herself
away
from
the
annoying
tiresome
world
once
again
she
would
be
free
to
summon
to
her
aching
consciousness
all
those
dear
memories
of
the
lost
little
lad
who
had
so
long
ago
stepped
into
that
vast
unknown
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
all
this
she
had
believed
would
be
the
case
when
pollyanna
should
go
home
but
now
that
pollyanna
was
really
going
home
the
picture
was
far
different
the
quiet
house
with
the
sun
shut
out
had
become
one
that
promised
to
be
gloomy
and
unbearable
the
peace
would
be
wretched
loneliness
and
as
for
her
being
able
to
hide
herself
away
from
the
annoying
tiresome
world
and
free
to
summon
to
her
aching
consciousness
all
those
dear
memories
of
that
lost
little
lad
just
as
if
anything
could
blot
out
those
other
aching
memories
of
the
new
jamie
who
yet
might
be
the
old
jamie
with
his
pitiful
pleading
eyes
full
well
now
carew
knew
that
without
pollyanna
the
house
would
be
empty
but
that
without
the
lad
jamie
it
would
be
worse
than
that
to
her
pride
this
knowledge
was
not
pleasing
to
her
heart
it
was
torture
since
the
boy
had
twice
said
that
he
would
not
come
for
a
time
during
those
last
few
days
of
pollyanna
stay
the
struggle
was
a
bitter
one
though
pride
always
kept
the
ascendancy
then
on
what
carew
knew
would
be
jamie
last
visit
her
heart
triumphed
and
once
more
she
asked
jamie
to
come
and
be
to
her
the
jamie
that
was
lost
what
she
said
she
never
could
remember
afterwards
but
what
the
boy
said
she
never
forgot
after
all
it
was
compassed
in
six
short
words
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
minute
his
eyes
had
searched
her
face
then
to
his
own
had
come
a
transfiguring
light
as
he
breathed
oh
yes
why
you
care
now
chapter
xiv
jimmy
and
the
monster
this
time
beldingsville
did
not
literally
welcome
pollyanna
home
with
brass
bands
and
bunting
perhaps
because
the
hour
of
her
expected
arrival
was
known
to
but
few
of
the
townspeople
but
there
certainly
was
no
lack
of
joyful
greetings
on
the
part
of
everybody
from
the
moment
she
stepped
from
the
railway
train
with
her
aunt
polly
and
chilton
nor
did
pollyanna
lose
any
time
in
starting
on
a
round
of
minute
calls
on
all
her
old
friends
indeed
for
the
next
few
days
according
to
nancy
there
was
no
putting
of
your
finger
on
her
anywheres
for
by
the
time
you
got
your
finger
down
she
there
and
always
everywhere
she
went
pollyanna
met
the
question
well
how
did
you
like
boston
perhaps
to
no
one
did
she
answer
this
more
fully
than
she
did
to
pendleton
as
was
usually
the
case
when
this
question
was
put
to
her
she
began
her
reply
with
a
troubled
frown
oh
i
liked
it
i
just
loved
it
some
of
it
but
not
all
of
it
smiled
pendleton
no
there
parts
of
it
oh
i
was
glad
to
be
there
she
explained
hastily
i
had
a
perfectly
lovely
time
and
lots
of
things
were
so
queer
and
different
you
know
like
eating
dinner
at
night
instead
of
noons
when
you
ought
to
eat
it
but
everybody
was
so
good
to
me
and
i
saw
such
a
lot
of
wonderful
things
bunker
hill
and
the
public
garden
and
the
seeing
boston
autos
and
miles
of
pictures
and
statues
and
and
streets
that
did
have
any
end
and
folks
i
never
saw
such
a
lot
of
folks
well
i
sure
i
thought
you
liked
folks
commented
the
man
i
do
pollyanna
frowned
again
and
pondered
but
what
the
use
of
such
a
lot
of
them
if
you
do
know
and
carew
would
let
me
she
did
know
herself
she
said
folks
did
down
there
there
was
a
slight
pause
then
with
a
sigh
pollyanna
resumed
i
reckon
maybe
that
the
part
i
do
like
the
most
that
folks
do
know
each
other
it
would
be
such
a
lot
nicer
if
they
did
why
just
think
pendleton
there
are
lots
of
folks
that
live
on
dirty
narrow
streets
and
do
even
have
beans
and
fish
balls
to
eat
nor
things
even
as
good
as
missionary
barrels
to
wear
then
there
are
other
folks
carew
and
a
whole
lot
like
her
that
live
in
perfectly
beautiful
houses
and
have
more
things
to
eat
and
wear
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
now
if
those
folks
only
knew
the
other
folks
but
pendleton
interrupted
with
a
laugh
my
dear
child
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
these
people
do
care
to
know
each
other
he
asked
quizzically
oh
but
some
of
them
do
maintained
pollyanna
in
eager
defense
now
there
sadie
dean
she
sells
bows
lovely
bows
in
a
big
store
she
wants
to
know
people
and
i
introduced
her
to
carew
and
we
had
her
up
to
the
house
and
we
had
jamie
and
lots
of
others
there
too
and
she
was
so
glad
to
know
them
and
that
what
made
me
think
that
if
only
a
lot
of
carew
kind
could
know
the
other
kind
but
of
course
could
do
the
introducing
i
did
know
many
of
them
myself
anyway
but
if
they
could
know
each
other
so
that
the
rich
people
could
give
the
poor
people
part
of
their
money
but
again
pendleton
interrupted
with
a
laugh
oh
pollyanna
pollyanna
he
chuckled
i
afraid
you
getting
into
pretty
deep
water
you
be
a
rabid
little
socialist
before
you
know
it
a
what
questioned
the
little
girl
dubiously
i
i
do
think
i
know
what
a
socialist
is
but
i
know
what
being
sociable
is
and
i
like
folks
that
are
that
if
it
anything
like
that
i
do
mind
being
one
a
mite
i
like
to
be
one
i
do
doubt
it
pollyanna
smiled
the
man
but
when
it
comes
to
this
scheme
of
yours
for
the
wholesale
distribution
of
wealth
got
a
problem
on
your
hands
that
you
might
have
difficulty
with
pollyanna
drew
a
long
sigh
i
know
she
nodded
that
the
way
carew
talked
she
says
i
do
understand
that
er
pauperize
her
and
be
indiscriminate
and
pernicious
and
well
it
was
something
like
that
anyway
bridled
the
little
girl
aggrievedly
as
the
man
began
to
laugh
and
anyway
i
do
understand
why
some
folks
should
have
such
a
lot
and
other
folks
should
have
anything
and
i
do
like
it
and
if
i
ever
have
a
lot
i
shall
just
give
some
of
it
to
folks
who
do
have
any
even
if
it
does
make
me
pauperized
and
pernicious
and
but
pendleton
was
laughing
so
hard
now
that
pollyanna
after
a
moment
struggle
surrendered
and
laughed
with
him
well
anyway
she
reiterated
when
she
had
caught
her
breath
i
do
understand
it
all
the
same
no
dear
i
afraid
you
do
agreed
the
man
growing
suddenly
very
grave
and
nor
any
of
the
rest
of
us
for
that
matter
but
tell
me
he
added
after
a
minute
who
is
this
jamie
you
been
talking
so
much
about
since
you
came
and
pollyanna
told
him
in
talking
of
jamie
pollyanna
lost
her
worried
baffled
look
pollyanna
loved
to
talk
of
jamie
here
was
something
she
understood
here
was
no
problem
that
had
to
deal
with
big
words
besides
in
this
particular
instance
would
not
pendleton
be
especially
interested
in
carew
taking
the
boy
into
her
home
for
who
better
than
himself
could
understand
the
need
of
a
presence
for
that
matter
pollyanna
talked
to
everybody
about
jamie
she
assumed
that
everybody
would
be
as
interested
as
she
herself
was
on
most
occasions
she
was
not
disappointed
in
the
interest
shown
but
one
day
she
met
with
a
surprise
it
came
through
jimmy
pendleton
say
look
he
demanded
one
afternoon
irritably
there
anybody
else
down
to
boston
but
just
that
everlasting
why
jimmy
bean
what
do
you
mean
cried
pollyanna
the
boy
lifted
his
chin
a
little
i
not
jimmy
bean
i
jimmy
pendleton
and
i
mean
that
i
should
think
from
your
talk
that
there
was
anybody
down
to
boston
but
just
that
loony
boy
who
calls
them
birds
and
squirrels
lancelot
and
all
that
tommyrot
why
jimmy
be
pendleton
gasped
pollyanna
then
with
some
spirit
jamie
is
loony
he
is
a
very
nice
boy
and
he
knows
a
lot
books
and
stories
why
he
can
make
stories
right
out
of
his
own
head
besides
it
is
lancelot
it
lancelot
if
you
knew
half
as
much
as
he
does
you
know
that
too
she
finished
with
flashing
eyes
jimmy
pendleton
flushed
miserably
and
looked
utterly
wretched
growing
more
and
more
jealous
moment
by
moment
still
doggedly
he
held
his
ground
well
anyhow
he
scoffed
i
do
think
much
of
his
name
humph
sounds
sissy
and
i
know
somebody
else
that
said
so
too
who
was
it
there
was
no
answer
who
was
it
demanded
pollyanna
more
peremptorily
dad
the
boy
voice
was
sullen
your
dad
repeated
pollyanna
in
amazement
why
how
could
he
know
jamie
he
did
was
about
that
jamie
was
about
me
the
boy
still
spoke
sullenly
with
his
eyes
turned
away
yet
there
was
a
curious
softness
in
his
voice
that
was
always
noticeable
whenever
he
spoke
of
his
father
you
yes
was
just
a
little
while
before
he
died
we
stopped
a
week
with
a
farmer
dad
helped
about
the
hayin
and
i
did
too
some
the
farmer
wife
was
awful
good
to
me
and
pretty
quick
she
was
callin
me
i
do
know
why
but
she
just
did
and
one
day
father
heard
her
he
got
awful
mad
so
mad
that
i
remembered
it
always
what
he
said
he
said
was
no
sort
of
a
name
for
a
boy
and
that
no
son
of
his
should
ever
be
called
it
he
said
was
a
sissy
name
and
he
hated
it
so
i
never
saw
him
so
mad
as
he
was
that
night
he
would
even
stay
to
finish
the
work
but
him
and
me
took
to
the
road
again
that
night
i
was
kind
of
sorry
i
liked
her
the
farmer
wife
i
mean
she
was
good
to
me
pollyanna
nodded
all
sympathy
and
interest
it
was
not
often
that
jimmy
said
much
of
that
mysterious
past
life
of
his
before
she
had
known
him
and
what
happened
next
she
prompted
pollyanna
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
all
about
the
original
subject
of
the
controversy
the
name
jamie
that
was
dubbed
sissy
the
boy
sighed
we
just
went
on
till
we
found
another
place
and
was
there
dad
died
then
they
put
me
in
the
and
then
you
ran
away
and
i
found
you
that
day
down
by
mrs
snow
exulted
pollyanna
softly
and
i
known
you
ever
since
oh
yes
and
you
known
me
ever
since
repeated
jimmy
but
in
a
far
different
voice
jimmy
had
suddenly
come
back
to
the
present
and
to
his
grievance
but
then
i
ai
you
know
he
finished
with
scornful
emphasis
as
he
turned
loftily
away
leaving
a
distressed
bewildered
pollyanna
behind
him
well
anyway
i
can
be
glad
he
does
always
act
like
this
sighed
the
little
girl
as
she
mournfully
watched
the
sturdy
boyish
figure
with
its
disagreeable
amazing
swagger
chapter

aunt

pollyanna
had
been
at

about
a
week
when
the

i
afraid
i
ca
you
would
have
to
know
what
she
was
before
you
did
see
her
to
be
sure
and
perhaps
you
saw
something
of
the
hush
and
gloom
in
which
she
has
shrouded
herself
for
so
many
years
but
you
can
have
no
conception
of
her
bitterness
of
heart
her
lack
of
aim
and
interest
her
insistence
upon
eternal
mourning
then
came
pollyanna
probably
i
did
tell
you
but
my
sister
regretted
her
promise
to
take
the
child
almost
the
minute
it
was
given
and
she
made
the
stern
stipulation
that
the
moment
pollyanna
began
to
preach
back
she
should
come
to
me
well
she
preached
at
least
my
sister
says
she
has
and
my
sister
ought
to
know
and
yet
well
just
let
me
tell
you
what
i
found
when
i
went
to
see
her
yesterday
perhaps
nothing
else
could
give
you
a
better
idea
of
what
that
wonderful
little
pollyanna
of
yours
has
accomplished
to
begin
with
as
i
approached
the
house
i
saw
that
nearly
all
the
shades
were
up
they
used
to
be
down
down
to
the
sill
the
minute
i
stepped
into
the
hall
i
heard
music
parsifal
the
were
open
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
roses
carew
and
master
jamie
are
in
the
said
the
maid
and
there
i
found
them
my
sister
and
the
youth
she
has
taken
into
her
home
listening
to
one
of
those
modern
contrivances
that
can
hold
an
entire
opera
company
including
the
orchestra
the
boy
was
in
a
wheel
chair
he
was
pale
but
plainly
beatifically
happy
my
sister
looked
ten
years
younger
her
usually
colorless
cheeks
showed
a
faint
pink
and
her
eyes
glowed
and
sparkled
a
little
later
after
i
had
talked
a
few
minutes
with
the
boy
my
sister
and
i
went
to
her
own
rooms
and
there
she
talked
to
me
of
jamie
not
of
the
old
jamie
as
she
used
to
with
eyes
and
hopeless
sighs
but
of
the
new
jamie
and
there
were
no
sighs
nor
tears
now
there
was
instead
the
eagerness
of
enthusiastic
interest
he
wonderful
she
began
that
is
best
in
music
art
and
literature
seems
to
appeal
to
him
in
a
perfectly
marvelous
fashion
only
of
course
he
needs
development
and
training
that
what
i
going
to
see
that
he
gets
a
tutor
is
coming
of
course
his
language
is
something
awful
at
the
same
time
he
has
read
so
many
good
books
that
his
vocabulary
is
quite
amazing
and
you
should
hear
the
stories
he
can
reel
off
of
course
in
general
education
he
is
very
deficient
but
he
eager
to
learn
so
that
will
soon
be
remedied
he
loves
music
and
i
shall
give
him
what
training
in
that
he
wishes
i
have
already
put
in
a
stock
of
carefully
selected
records
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
his
face
when
he
first
heard
that
holy
grail
music
he
knows
all
about
king
arthur
and
his
round
table
and
he
prattles
of
knights
and
lords
and
ladies
as
you
and
i
do
of
the
members
of
our
own
family
only
sometimes
i
do
know
whether
his
sir
lancelot
means
the
ancient
knight
or
a
squirrel
in
the
public
garden
and
della
i
believe
he
can
be
made
to
walk
i
going
to
have
ames
see
him
anyway
and
and
so
on
and
on
she
talked
while
i
sat
amazed
and
but
oh
so
happy
i
tell
you
all
this
dear
chilton
so
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
interested
she
is
how
eagerly
she
is
going
to
watch
this
boy
growth
and
development
and
how
in
spite
of
herself
it
is
all
going
to
change
her
attitude
toward
life
she
ca
do
what
she
is
doing
for
this
boy
jamie
and
not
do
for
herself
at
the
same
time
never
again
i
believe
will
she
be
the
soured
morose
woman
she
was
before
and
it
all
because
of
pollyanna
pollyanna
dear
child
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
she
is
so
unconscious
of
the
whole
thing
i
do
believe
even
my
sister
yet
quite
realizes
what
is
taking
place
within
her
own
heart
and
life
and
certainly
pollyanna
does
least
of
all
does
she
realize
the
part
she
played
in
the
change
and
now
dear
chilton
how
can
i
thank
you
i
know
i
ca
so
i
not
even
going
to
try
yet
in
your
heart
i
believe
you
know
how
grateful
i
am
to
both
you
and
pollyanna
della
wetherby
well
it
seems
to
have
worked
a
cure
all
right
smiled
chilton
when
his
wife
had
finished
reading
the
letter
to
him
to
his
surprise
she
lifted
a
quick
remonstrative
hand
thomas
do
please
she
begged
why
polly
what
the
matter
are
you
glad
that
that
the
medicine
worked
chilton
dropped
despairingly
back
in
her
chair
there
you
go
again
thomas
she
sighed
of
course
i
glad
that
this
misguided
woman
has
forsaken
the
error
of
her
ways
and
found
that
she
can
be
of
use
to
some
one
and
of
course
i
glad
that
pollyanna
did
it
but
i
am
not
glad
to
have
that
child
continually
spoken
of
as
if
she
were
a
a
bottle
of
medicine
or
a
do
you
see
nonsense
after
all
where
the
harm
i
called
pollyanna
a
tonic
ever
since
i
knew
her
harm
thomas
chilton
that
child
is
growing
older
every
day
do
you
want
to
spoil
her
thus
far
she
has
been
utterly
unconscious
of
her
extraordinary
power
and
therein
lies
the
secret
of
her
success
the
minute
she
consciously
sets
herself
to
reform
somebody
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
she
will
be
simply
impossible
consequently
heaven
forbid
that
she
ever
gets
it
into
her
head
that
she
anything
like
a
for
poor
sick
suffering
humanity
nonsense
i
would
worry
laughed
the
doctor
but
i
do
worry
thomas
but
polly
think
of
what
she
done
argued
the
doctor
think
of
mrs
snow
and
john
pendleton
and
quantities
of
others
why
not
the
same
people
at
all
that
they
used
to
be
any
more
than
carew
is
and
pollyanna
did
do
it
bless
her
heart
i
know
she
did
nodded
polly
chilton
emphatically
but
i
do
want
pollyanna
to
know
she
did
it
oh
of
course
she
knows
it
in
a
way
she
knows
she
taught
them
to
play
the
glad
game
with
her
and
that
they
are
lots
happier
in
consequence
and
that
all
right
it
a
game
her
game
and
they
playing
it
together
to
you
i
will
admit
that
pollyanna
has
preached
to
us
one
of
the
most
powerful
sermons
i
ever
heard
but
the
minute
she
knows
it
well
i
do
want
her
to
that
all
and
right
now
let
me
tell
you
that
i
decided
that
i
will
go
to
germany
with
you
this
fall
at
first
i
thought
i
would
i
did
want
to
leave
pollyanna
and
i
not
going
to
leave
her
now
i
going
to
take
her
with
me
take
her
with
us
good
why
not
i
got
to
that
all
furthermore
i
should
be
glad
to
plan
to
stay
a
few
years
just
as
you
said
you
like
to
i
want
to
get
pollyanna
away
quite
away
from
beldingsville
for
a
while
i
like
to
keep
her
sweet
and
unspoiled
if
i
can
and
she
shall
not
get
silly
notions
into
her
head
if
i
can
help
myself
why
thomas
chilton
do
we
want
that
child
made
an
insufferable
little
prig
we
certainly
do
laughed
the
doctor
but
for
that
matter
i
do
believe
anything
or
anybody
could
make
her
so
however
this
germany
idea
suits
me
to
a
you
know
i
did
want
to
come
away
when
i
did
if
it
had
been
for
pollyanna
so
the
sooner
we
get
back
there
the
better
i
satisfied
and
i
like
to
stay
for
a
little
practice
as
well
as
study
then
that
settled
and
aunt
polly
gave
a
satisfied
sigh
chapter
xvi
when
pollyanna
was
expected
all
beldingsville
was
fairly
aquiver
with
excitement
not
since
pollyanna
whittier
came
home
from
the
sanatorium
walking
had
there
been
such
a
chatter
of
talk
over
fences
and
on
every
street
corner
too
the
center
of
interest
was
pollyanna
once
again
pollyanna
was
coming
home
but
so
different
a
pollyanna
and
so
different
a
homecoming
pollyanna
was
twenty
now
for
six
years
she
had
spent
her
winters
in
germany
her
summers
leisurely
traveling
with
chilton
and
his
wife
only
once
during
that
time
had
she
been
in
beldingsville
and
then
it
was
for
but
a
short
four
weeks
the
summer
she
was
sixteen
now
she
was
coming
home
to
stay
report
said
she
and
her
aunt
polly
the
doctor
would
not
be
with
them
six
months
before
the
town
had
been
shocked
and
saddened
by
the
news
that
the
doctor
had
died
suddenly
beldingsville
had
expected
then
that
chilton
and
pollyanna
would
return
at
once
to
the
old
home
but
they
had
not
come
instead
had
come
word
that
the
widow
and
her
niece
would
remain
abroad
for
a
time
the
report
said
that
in
entirely
new
surroundings
chilton
was
trying
to
seek
distraction
and
relief
from
her
great
sorrow
very
soon
however
vague
rumors
and
rumors
not
so
vague
began
to
float
through
the
town
that
financially
all
was
not
well
with
polly
chilton
certain
railroad
stocks
in
which
it
was
known
that
the
harrington
estate
had
been
heavily
interested
wavered
uncertainly
then
tumbled
into
ruin
and
disaster
other
investments
according
to
report
were
in
a
most
precarious
condition
from
the
doctor
estate
little
could
be
expected
he
had
not
been
a
rich
man
and
his
expenses
had
been
heavy
for
the
past
six
years
beldingsville
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
not
quite
six
months
after
the
death
word
came
that
chilton
and
pollyanna
were
coming
home
once
more
the
old
harrington
homestead
so
long
closed
and
silent
showed
windows
and
doors
once
more
nancy
now
timothy
durgin
swept
and
scrubbed
and

until
the
old
place
shone
in
spotless
order

no
instructions
ter
do
it

nancy
explained
to
curious
friends
and
neighbors

at
the
gate
or
came

boldly

the
doorways

the
key
and

to

two
poor
things
ter
come
into
this
house
alone
and
all
forlorn
like
that
and

parlor

as
if

was
a
fine

his
kind
heart
an
never

shame
a
shame

of
miss
polly
i
mean
mis
chilton
bein
poor
my
stars
and
stockings
i
ca
sense
it
i
ca
i
ca
perhaps
to
no
one
did
nancy
speak
so
interestedly
as
she
did
to
a
tall
young
fellow
with
peculiarly
frank
eyes
and
a
particularly
winning
smile
who
cantered
up
to
the
side
door
on
a
mettlesome
thoroughbred
at
ten
that
thursday
morning
at
the
same
time
to
no
one
did
she
talk
with
so
much
evident
embarrassment
so
far
as
the
manner
of
address
was
concerned
for
her
tongue
stumbled
and
blundered
out
a
master
jimmy
er
bean
i
mean
pendleton
master
jimmy
with
a
nervous
precipitation
that
sent
the
young
man
himself
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
never
mind
nancy
let
it
go
at
whatever
comes
handiest
he
chuckled
i
found
out
what
i
wanted
to
know
chilton
and
her
niece
really
are
expected
yes
sir
they
be
sir
courtesied
nancy
more
the
pity
not
but
that
i
shall
be
glad
enough
ter
see
you
understand
but
the
way
they
yes
i
know
i
understand
nodded
the
youth
gravely
his
eyes
sweeping
the
fine
old
house
before
him
well
i
suppose
that
part
ca
be
helped
but
i
glad
you
doing
just
what
you
are
doing
that
will
help
a
whole
lot
he
finished
with
a
bright
smile
as
he
wheeled
about
and
rode
rapidly
down
the
driveway
back
on
the
steps
nancy
wagged
her
head
wisely
i
ai
surprised
master
jimmy
she
declared
aloud
her
admiring
eyes
following
the
handsome
figures
of
horse
and
man
i
surprised
that
you
ai
lettin
no
grass
grow
under
your
feet
inquirin
for
miss
pollyanna
i
said
long
ago
come
sometime
an
it
bound
to
what
with
your
growin
so
handsome
and
tall
an
i
hope
i
do
i
do
it
be
just
like
a
book
what
with
her
you
an
gettin
you
into
that
grand
home
with
pendleton
my
but
who
ever
take
you
now
for
that
little
jimmy
bean
that
used
to
be
i
never
did
see
such
a
change
in
anybody
i
did
i
did
she
answered
with
one
last
look
at
the
rapidly
disappearing
figures
far
down
the
road
something
of
the
same
thought
must
have
been
in
the
mind
of
john
pendleton
some
time
later
that
same
morning
for
from
the
veranda
of
his
big
gray
house
on
pendleton
hill
john
pendleton
was
watching
the
rapid
approach
of
that
same
horse
and
rider
and
in
his
eyes
was
an
expression
very
like
the
one
that
had
been
in
nancy
durgin
on
his
lips
too
was
an
admiring
jove
what
a
handsome
pair
as
the
two
dashed
by
on
the
way
to
the
stable
five
minutes
later
the
youth
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
slowly
ascended
the
veranda
steps
well
my
boy
is
it
true
are
they
coming
asked
the
man
with
visible
eagerness
yes
when
the
young
fellow
dropped
himself
into
a
chair
at
the
crisp
terseness
of
the
answer
john
pendleton
frowned
he
threw
a
quick
look
into
the
young
man
face
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
a
little
abruptly
he
asked
why
son
what
the
matter
matter
nothing
sir
nonsense
i
know
better
you
left
here
an
hour
ago
so
eager
to
be
off
that
wild
horses
could
not
have
held
you
now
you
sit
humped
up
in
that
chair
and
look
as
if
wild
horses
could
drag
you
out
of
it
if
i
did
know
better
i
think
you
were
glad
that
our
friends
are
coming
he
paused
evidently
for
a
reply
but
he
did
not
get
it
why
jim
are
you
glad
they
coming
the
young
fellow
laughed
and
stirred
restlessly
why
yes
of
course
humph
you
act
like
it
the
youth
laughed
again
a
boyish
red
flamed
into
his
face
well
it
only
that
i
was
thinking
of
pollyanna
pollyanna
why
man
alive
you
done
nothing
but
prattle
of
pollyanna
ever
since
you
came
home
from
boston
and
found
she
was
expected
i
thought
you
were
dying
to
see
pollyanna
the
other
leaned
forward
with
curious
intentness
that
exactly
it
see
you
said
it
a
minute
ago
it
just
as
if
yesterday
wild
horses
could
keep
me
from
seeing
pollyanna
and
now
when
i
know
she
coming
they
could
drag
me
to
see
her
why
jim
at
the
shocked
incredulity
on
john
pendleton
face
the
younger
man
fell
back
in
his
chair
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
yes
i
know
it
sounds
nutty
and
i
do
expect
i
can
make
you
understand
but
somehow
i
do
think
i
ever
wanted
pollyanna
to
grow
up
she
was
such
a
dear
just
as
she
was
i
like
to
think
of
her
as
i
saw
her
last
her
earnest
freckled
little
face
her
yellow
pigtails
her
tearful
yes
i
glad
i
going
but
i
think
i
shall
be
a
little
gladder
when
i
come
back
that
the
last
time
i
saw
her
you
know
we
were
in
egypt
that
time
she
was
here
four
years
ago
i
know
i
see
exactly
what
you
mean
too
i
think
i
felt
the
same
way
till
i
saw
her
last
winter
in
rome
the
other
turned
eagerly
sure
enough
you
have
seen
her
tell
me
about
her
a
shrewd
twinkle
came
into
john
pendleton
eyes
oh
but
i
thought
you
did
want
to
know
pollyanna
grown
up
with
a
grimace
the
young
fellow
tossed
this
aside
is
she
pretty
oh
ye
young
men
shrugged
john
pendleton
in
mock
despair
always
the
first
question
she
pretty
well
is
she
insisted
the
youth
i
let
you
judge
for
yourself
if
you
on
second
thoughts
though
i
believe
i
wo
you
might
be
too
disappointed
pollyanna
pretty
so
far
as
regular
features
curls
and
dimples
go
in
fact
to
my
certain
knowledge
the
great
cross
in
pollyanna
life
thus
far
is
that
she
is
so
sure
she
is
pretty
long
ago
she
told
me
that
black
curls
were
one
of
the
things
she
was
going
to
have
when
she
got
to
heaven
and
last
year
in
rome
she
said
something
else
it
was
much
perhaps
so
far
as
words
went
but
i
detected
the
longing
beneath
she
said
she
did
wish
that
sometime
some
one
would
write
a
novel
with
a
heroine
who
had
straight
hair
and
a
freckle
on
her
nose
but
that
she
supposed
she
ought
to
be
glad
girls
in
books
did
have
to
have
them
that
sounds
like
the
old
pollyanna
oh
you
still
find
her
pollyanna
smiled
the
man
quizzically
besides
think
she
pretty
her
eyes
are
lovely
she
is
the
picture
of
health
she
carries
herself
with
all
the
joyous
springiness
of
youth
and
her
whole
face
lights
up
so
wonderfully
when
she
talks
that
you
quite
forget
whether
her
features
are
regular
or
not
does
she
still
play
the
game
john
pendleton
smiled
fondly
i
imagine
she
plays
it
but
she
does
say
much
about
it
now
i
fancy
anyhow
she
did
to
me
the
two
or
three
times
i
saw
her
there
was
a
short
silence
then
a
little
slowly
young
pendleton
said
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
worrying
me
that
game
has
been
so
much
to
so
many
people
it
has
meant
so
much
everywhere
all
through
the
town
i
could
bear
to
think
of
her
giving
it
up
and
not
playing
it
at
the
same
time
i
could
fancy
a
pollyanna
perpetually
admonishing
people
to
be
glad
for
something
someway
i
well
as
i
said
i
i
just
did
want
pollyanna
to
grow
up
anyhow
well
i
would
worry
shrugged
the
elder
man
with
a
peculiar
smile
always
with
pollyanna
you
know
it
was
the
shower
both
literally
and
figuratively
and
i
think
you
find
she
lives
up
to
the
same
principle
now
though
perhaps
not
quite
in
the
same
way
poor
child
i
fear
she
need
some
kind
of
game
to
make
existence
endurable
for
a
while
at
least
do
you
mean
because
chilton
has
lost
her
money
are
they
so
very
poor
then
i
suspect
they
are
in
fact
they
are
in
rather
bad
shape
so
far
as
money
matters
go
as
i
happen
to
know
chilton
own
fortune
has
shrunk
unbelievably
and
poor
tom
estate
is
very
small
and
hopelessly
full
of
bad
debts
professional
services
never
paid
for
and
that
never
will
be
paid
for
tom
could
never
say
no
when
his
help
was
needed
and
all
the
dead
beats
in
town
knew
it
and
imposed
on
him
accordingly
expenses
have
been
heavy
with
him
lately
besides
he
expected
great
things
when
he
should
have
completed
this
special
work
in
germany
naturally
he
supposed
his
wife
and
pollyanna
were
more
than
amply
provided
for
through
the
harrington
estate
so
he
had
no
worry
in
that
direction
i
see
i
see
too
bad
too
bad
but
that
is
all
it
was
about
two
months
after
tom
death
that
i
saw
chilton
and
pollyanna
in
rome
and
chilton
then
was
in
a
terrible
state
in
addition
to
her
sorrow
she
had
just
begun
to
get
an
inkling
of
the
trouble
with
her
finances
and
she
was
nearly
frantic
she
refused
to
come
home
she
declared
she
never
wanted
to
see
beldingsville
or
anybody
in
it
again
you
see
she
has
always
been
a
peculiarly
proud
woman
and
it
was
all
affecting
her
in
a
rather
curious
way
pollyanna
said
that
her
aunt
seemed
possessed
with
the
idea
that
beldingsville
had
not
approved
of
her
marrying
chilton
in
the
first
place
at
her
age
and
now
that
he
was
dead
she
felt
that
they
were
utterly
out
of
sympathy
in
any
grief
that
she
might
show
she
resented
keenly
too
the
fact
that
they
must
now
know
that
she
was
poor
as
well
as
widowed
in
short
she
had
worked
herself
into
an
utterly
morbid
wretched
state
as
unreasonable
as
it
was
terrible
poor
little
pollyanna
it
was
a
marvel
to
me
how
she
stood
it
all
is
if
chilton
kept
it
up
and
continues
to
keep
it
up
that
child
will
be
a
wreck
that
why
i
said
pollyanna
would
need
some
kind
of
a
game
if
ever
anybody
did
the
pity
of
it
to
think
of
that
happening
to
pollyanna
exclaimed
the
young
man
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
yes
and
you
can
see
all
is
not
right
by
the
way
they
are
coming
so
quietly
with
not
a
word
to
anybody
that
was
polly
chilton
doings
i
warrant
she
did
want
to
be
met
by
anybody
i
understand
she
wrote
to
no
one
but
her
old
tom
wife
durgin
who
had
the
keys
yes
so
nancy
told
me
good
old
soul
she
got
the
whole
house
open
and
had
contrived
somehow
to
make
it
look
as
if
it
was
a
tomb
of
dead
hopes
and
lost
pleasures
of
course
the
grounds
looked
fairly
well
for
old
tom
has
kept
them
up
after
a
fashion
but
it
made
my
heart
ache
the
whole
thing
there
was
a
long
silence
then
curtly
john
pendleton
suggested
they
ought
to
be
met
they
will
be
met
are
you
going
to
the
station
i
am
then
you
know
what
train
they
coming
on
oh
no
neither
does
nancy
then
how
will
you
manage
i
going
to
begin
in
the
morning
and
go
to
every
train
till
they
come
laughed
the
young
man
a
bit
grimly
timothy
going
too
with
the
family
carriage
after
all
there
are
many
trains
anyway
that
they
can
come
on
you
know
i
know
said
john
pendleton
jim
i
admire
your
nerve
but
not
your
judgment
i
glad
you
going
to
follow
your
nerve
and
not
your
judgment
however
and
i
wish
you
good
luck
thank
you
sir
smiled
the
young
man
dolefully
i
need
your
good
wishes
all
right
all
right
as
nancy
says
chapter
xvii
when
pollyanna
came
as
the
train
neared
beldingsville
pollyanna
watched
her
aunt
anxiously
all
day
chilton
had
been
growing
more
and
more
restless
more
and
more
gloomy
and
pollyanna
was
fearful
of
the
time
when
the
familiar
home
station
should
be
reached
as
pollyanna
looked
at
her
aunt
her
heart
ached
she
was
thinking
that
she
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
any
one
could
have
changed
and
aged
so
greatly
in
six
short
months
chilton
eyes
were
lusterless
her
cheeks
pallid
and
shrunken
and
her
forehead
crossed
and
recrossed
by
fretful
lines
her
mouth
drooped
at
the
corners
and
her
hair
was
combed
tightly
back
in
the
unbecoming
fashion
that
had
been
hers
when
pollyanna
first
had
seen
her
years
before
all
the
softness
and
sweetness
that
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
with
her
marriage
had
dropped
from
her
like
a
cloak
leaving
uppermost
the
old
hardness
and
sourness
that
had
been
hers
when
she
was
miss
polly
harrington
unloved
and
unloving
pollyanna
chilton
voice
was
incisive
pollyanna
started
guiltily
she
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
her
aunt
might
have
read
her
thoughts
yes
auntie
where
is
that
black
bag
the
little
one
right
here
well
i
wish
you
get
out
my
black
veil
we
nearly
there
but
it
so
hot
and
thick
auntie
pollyanna
i
asked
for
that
black
veil
if
you
please
learn
to
do
what
i
ask
without
arguing
about
it
it
would
be
a
great
deal
easier
for
me
i
want
that
veil
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
give
all
beldingsville
a
chance
to
see
how
i
it
oh
auntie
they
never
be
there
in
that
spirit
protested
pollyanna
hurriedly
rummaging
in
the
black
bag
for
the
veil
besides
there
wo
be
anybody
there
anyway
to
meet
us
we
did
tell
any
one
we
were
coming
you
know
yes
i
know
we
did
tell
any
one
to
meet
us
but
we
instructed
durgin
to
have
the
rooms
aired
and
the
key
under
the
mat
for
do
you
suppose
mary
durgin
has
kept
that
information
to
herself
not
much
half
the
town
knows
we
coming
and
a
dozen
or
more
will
around
the
station
about
train
time
i
know
them
they
want
to
see
what
polly
harrington
poor
looks
like
they
oh
auntie
auntie
begged
pollyanna
with
tears
in
her
eyes
if
i
was
so
alone
if
the
doctor
were
only
here
and
she
stopped
speaking
and
turned
away
her
head
her
mouth
worked
convulsively
where
is
that
veil
she
choked
huskily
yes
dear
here
it
is
right
here
comforted
pollyanna
whose
only
aim
now
plainly
was
to
get
the
veil
into
her
aunt
hands
with
all
haste
and
here
we
are
now
almost
there
oh
auntie
i
do
wish
had
old
tom
or
timothy
meet
us
and
ride
home
in
state
as
if
we
could
afford
to
keep
such
horses
and
carriages
and
when
we
know
we
shall
have
to
sell
them
no
i
thank
you
pollyanna
i
prefer
to
use
the
public
carriage
under
those
circumstances
i
know
but
the
train
came
to
a
jolting
jarring
stop
and
only
a
fluttering
sigh
finished
pollyanna
sentence
as
the
two
women
stepped
to
the
platform
chilton
in
her
black
veil
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
pollyanna
however
was
nodding
and
smiling
tearfully
in
half
a
dozen
directions
before
she
had
taken
twice
as
many
steps
then
suddenly
she
found
herself
looking
into
a
familiar
yet
strangely
unfamiliar
face
why
it
is
it
is
jimmy
she
beamed
reaching
forth
a
cordial
hand
that
is
i
suppose
i
should
say
pendleton
she
corrected
herself
with
a
shy
smile
that
said
plainly
now
that
you
grown
so
tall
and
fine
i
like
to
see
you
try
it
challenged
the
youth
with
a
very
tilt
to
his
chin
he
turned
then
to
speak
to
chilton
but
that
lady
with
her
head
half
averted
was
hurrying
on
a
little
in
advance
he
turned
back
to
pollyanna
his
eyes
troubled
and
sympathetic
if
you
please
come
this
way
both
of
you
he
urged
hurriedly
timothy
is
here
with
the
carriage
oh
how
good
of
him
cried
pollyanna
but
with
an
anxious
glance
at
the
somber
veiled
figure
ahead
timidly
she
touched
her
aunt
arm
auntie
dear
timothy
here
he
come
with
the
carriage
he
over
this
side
and
this
is
jimmy
bean
auntie
you
remember
jimmy
bean
in
her
nervousness
and
embarrassment
pollyanna
did
not
notice
that
she
had
given
the
young
man
the
old
name
of
his
boyhood
chilton
however
evidently
did
notice
it
with
palpable
reluctance
she
turned
and
inclined
her
head
ever
so
slightly
pendleton
is
very
kind
i
am
sure
but
i
am
sorry
that
he
or
timothy
took
quite
so
much
trouble
she
said
frigidly
no
trouble
no
trouble
at
all
i
assure
you
laughed
the
young
man
trying
to
hide
his
embarrassment
now
if
you
just
let
me
have
your
checks
so
i
can
see
to
your
baggage
thank
you
began
chilton
but
i
am
very
sure
we
can
but
pollyanna
with
a
relieved
little
thank
you
had
already
passed
over
the
checks
and
dignity
demanded
that
chilton
say
no
more
the
drive
home
was
a
silent
one
timothy
vaguely
hurt
at
the
reception
he
had
met
with
at
the
hands
of
his
former
mistress
sat
up
in
front
stiff
and
straight
with
tense
lips
chilton
after
a
weary
well
well
child
just
as
you
please
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
ride
home
in
it
now
had
subsided
into
stern
gloom
pollyanna
however
was
neither
stern
nor
tense
nor
gloomy
with
eager
though
tearful
eyes
she
greeted
each
loved
landmark
as
they
came
to
it
only
once
did
she
speak
and
that
was
to
say
is
jimmy
fine
how
he
has
improved
and
has
he
the
nicest
eyes
and
smile
she
waited
hopefully
but
as
there
was
no
reply
to
this
she
contented
herself
with
a
cheerful
well
i
think
he
has
anyhow
timothy
had
been
both
too
aggrieved
and
too
afraid
to
tell
chilton
what
to
expect
at
home
so
the
doors
and
rooms
with
nancy
courtesying
on
the
porch
were
a
complete
surprise
to
chilton
and
pollyanna
why
nancy
how
perfectly
lovely
cried
pollyanna
springing
lightly
to
the
ground
auntie
here
nancy
to
welcome
us
and
only
see
how
charming
she
made
everything
look
pollyanna
voice
was
determinedly
cheerful
though
it
shook
audibly
this
without
the
dear
doctor
whom
she
had
loved
so
well
was
not
easy
for
her
and
if
hard
for
her
she
knew
something
of
what
it
must
be
for
her
aunt
she
knew
too
that
the
one
thing
her
aunt
was
dreading
was
a
breakdown
before
nancy
than
which
nothing
could
be
worse
in
her
eyes
behind
the
heavy
black
veil
the
eyes
were
brimming
and
the
lips
were
trembling
pollyanna
knew
she
knew
too
that
to
hide
these
facts
her
aunt
would
probably
seize
the
first
opportunity
for
faultfinding
and
make
her
anger
a
cloak
to
hide
the
fact
that
her
heart
was
breaking
pollyanna
was
not
surprised
therefore
to
hear
her
aunt
few
cold
words
of
greeting
to
nancy
followed
by
a
sharp
of
course
all
this
was
very
kind
nancy
but
really
i
would
have
much
preferred
that
you
had
not
done
it
all
the
joy
fled
from
nancy
face
she
looked
hurt
and
frightened
oh
but
miss
polly
i
mean
mis
chilton
she
entreated
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
let
you
there
there
never
mind
nancy
interrupted
chilton
i
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
and
with
her
head
proudly
high
she
swept
out
of
the
room
a
minute
later
they
heard
the
door
of
her
bedroom
shut
nancy
turned
in
dismay
oh
miss
pollyanna
what
is
it
what
have
i
done
i
thought
like
it
i
meant
it
all
right
of
course
you
did
wept
pollyanna
fumbling
in
her
bag
for
her
handkerchief
and
was
lovely
to
have
you
do
it
too
just
lovely
but
she
did
like
it
yes
she
did
but
she
did
want
to
show
she
liked
it
she
was
afraid
if
she
did
she
show
other
things
and
oh
nancy
nancy
so
glad
just
to
and
pollyanna
was
sobbing
on
nancy
shoulder
there
there
dear
so
she
shall
so
she
shall
soothed
nancy
patting
the
heaving
shoulders
with
one
hand
and
trying
with
the
other
to
make
the
corner
of
her
apron
serve
as
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
own
tears
away
you
see
i
must
cry
before
her
faltered
pollyanna
and
it
was
hard
coming
here
the
first
time
you
know
and
all
and
i
knew
how
she
was
feeling
of
course
of
course
poor
lamb
crooned
nancy
and
to
think
the
first
thing
should
have
done
was
somethin
ter
vex
her
and
oh
but
she
was
vexed
at
that
corrected
pollyanna
agitatedly
it
just
her
way
nancy
you
see
she
does
like
to
show
how
badly
she
feels
about
about
the
doctor
and
she
so
afraid
she
will
show
it
that

takes
anything
for
an
excuse

the
same

nancy

snapped
together
a
little
severely
and
her
sympathetic
pats

minute

more
loving

possible

lamb

very
economically
aunt
polly
says
ho
as
if
i
take
money
from
began
nancy
in
bridling
wrath
but
at
the
expression
on
the
other
face
she
stopped
and
let
her
words
dwindle
off
in
a
mumbling
protest
as
she
hurried
from
the
room
to
look
after
her
creamed
chicken
on
the
stove
not
until
supper
was
over
and
everything
put
in
order
did
timothy
durgin
consent
to
drive
away
with
her
husband
then
she
went
with
evident
reluctance
and
with
many
pleadings
to
be
allowed
to
come
just
ter
help
out
a
bit
at
any
time
after
nancy
had
gone
pollyanna
came
into
the
where
chilton
was
sitting
alone
her
hand
over
her
eyes
well
dearie
shall
i
light
up
suggested
pollyanna
brightly
oh
i
suppose
so
was
nancy
a
dear
to
fix
us
all
up
so
nice
no
answer
where
in
the
world
she
found
all
these
flowers
i
ca
imagine
she
has
them
in
every
room
down
here
and
in
both
bedrooms
too
still
no
answer
pollyanna
gave
a
sigh
and
threw
a
wistful
glance
into
her
aunt
averted
face
after
a
moment
she
began
again
hopefully
i
saw
old
tom
in
the
garden
poor
man
his
rheumatism
is
worse
than
ever
he
was
bent
nearly
double
he
inquired
very
particularly
for
you
and
chilton
turned
with
a
sharp
interruption
pollyanna
what
are
we
going
to
do
do
why
the
best
we
can
of
course
dearie
chilton
gave
an
impatient
gesture
come
come
pollyanna
do
be
serious
for
once
you
find
it
is
serious
fast
enough
what
are
we
going
to
do
as
you
know
my
income
has
almost
entirely
stopped
of
course
some
of
the
things
are
worth
something
i
suppose
but
hart
says
very
few
of
them
will
pay
anything
at
present
we
have
something
in
the
bank
and
a
little
coming
in
of
course
and
we
have
this
house
but
of
what
earthly
use
is
the
house
we
ca
eat
it
or
wear
it
it
too
big
for
us
the
way
we
shall
have
to
live
and
we
could
sell
it
for
half
what
really
worth
unless
we
happened
to
find
just
the
person
that
wanted
it
sell
it
oh
auntie
you
would
this
beautiful
house
full
of
lovely
things
i
may
have
to
pollyanna
we
have
to
eat
unfortunately
i
know
it
and
i
always
so
hungry
mourned
pollyanna
with
a
rueful
laugh
still
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
my
appetite
is
so
good
very
likely
you
find
something
to
be
glad
about
of
course
but
what
shall
we
do
child
i
do
wish
you
be
serious
for
a
minute
a
quick
change
came
to
pollyanna
face
i
am
serious
aunt
polly
i
been
thinking
i
i
wish
i
could
earn
some
money
oh
child
child
to
think
of
my
ever
living
to
hear
you
say
that
moaned
the
woman
a
daughter
of
the
harringtons
having
to
earn
her
bread
oh
but
that
is
the
way
to
look
at
it
laughed
pollyanna
you
ought
to
be
glad
if
a
daughter
of
the
harringtons
is
smart
enough
to
earn
her
bread
that
is
any
disgrace
aunt
polly
perhaps
not
but
it
is
very
pleasant
to
one
pride
after
the
position
we
always
occupied
in
beldingsville
pollyanna
pollyanna
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
her
eyes
were
musingly
fixed
on
space
if
only
i
had
some
talent
if
only
i
could
do
something
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
she
sighed
at
last
i
can
sing
a
little
play
a
little
embroider
a
little
and
darn
a
little
but
i
ca
do
any
of
them
well
not
well
enough
to
be
paid
for
it
i
think
i
like
best
to
cook
she
resumed
after
a
silence
and
keep
house
you
know
i
loved
that
in
germany
winters
when
gretchen
used
to
bother
us
so
much
by
not
coming
when
we
wanted
her
but
i
do
exactly
want
to
go
into
other
people
kitchens
to
do
it
as
if
i
let
you
pollyanna
shuddered
chilton
again
and
of
course
to
just
work
in
our
own
kitchen
here
does
bring
in
anything
bemoaned
pollyanna
not
any
money
i
mean
and
money
we
need
it
most
emphatically
is
sighed
aunt
polly
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
at
last
by
pollyanna
to
think
that
after
all
you
done
for
me
auntie
to
think
that
now
if
i
only
could
i
have
such
a
splendid
chance
to
help
and
yet
i
ca
do
it
oh
why
was
i
born
with
something
that
worth
money
there
there
child
do
do
of
course
if
the
doctor
the
words
choked
into
silence
pollyanna
looked
up
quickly
and
sprang
to
her
feet
dear
dear
this
will
never
do
she
exclaimed
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
do
you
fret
auntie
what
you
wager
that
i
do
develop
the
most
marvelous
talent
going
one
of
these
days
besides
think
it
real
exciting
all
this
there
so
much
uncertainty
in
it
there
a
lot
of
fun
in
wanting
things
and
then
watching
for
them
to
come
just
living
along
and
knowing
you
going
to
have
everything
you
want
is
so
so
humdrum
you
know
she
finished
with
a
gay
little
laugh
chilton
however
did
not
laugh
she
only
sighed
and
said
dear
me
pollyanna
what
a
child
you
are
chapter
xviii
a
matter
of
adjustment
the
first
few
days
at
beldingsville
were
not
easy
either
for
chilton
or
for
pollyanna
they
were
days
of
adjustment
and
days
of
adjustment
are
seldom
easy
from
travel
and
excitement
it
was
not
easy
to
put
one
mind
to
the
consideration
of
the
price
of
butter
and
the
delinquencies
of
the
butcher
from
having
all
one
time
for
one
own
it
was
not
easy
to
find
always
the
next
task
clamoring
to
be
done
friends
and
neighbors
called
too
and
although
pollyanna
welcomed
them
with
glad
cordiality
chilton
when
possible
excused
herself
and
always
she
said
bitterly
to
pollyanna
curiosity
i
suppose
to
see
how
polly
harrington
likes
being
poor
of
the
doctor
chilton
seldom
spoke
yet
pollyanna
knew
very
well
that
almost
never
was
he
absent
from
her
thoughts
and
that
more
than
half
her
taciturnity
was
but
her
usual
cloak
for
a
deeper
emotion
which
she
did
not
care
to
show
jimmy
pendleton
pollyanna
saw
several
times
during
that
first
month
he
came
first
with
john
pendleton
for
a
somewhat
stiff
and
ceremonious
call
not
that
it
was
either
stiff
or
ceremonious
until
after
aunt
polly
came
into
the
room
then
it
was
both
for
some
reason
aunt
polly
had
not
excused
herself
on
this
occasion
after
that
jimmy
had
come
by
himself
once
with
flowers
once
with
a
book
for
aunt
polly
twice
with
no
excuse
at
all
pollyanna
welcomed
him
with
frank
pleasure
always
aunt
polly
after
that
first
time
did
not
see
him
at
all
to
the
most
of
their
friends
and
acquaintances
pollyanna
said
little
about
the
change
in
their
circumstances
to
jimmy
however
she
talked
freely
and
always
her
constant
cry
was
if
only
i
could
do
something
to
bring
in
some
money
i
getting
to
be
the
most
mercenary
little
creature
you
ever
saw
she
laughed
dolefully
i
got
so
i
measure
everything
with
a
dollar
bill
and
i
actually
think
in
quarters
and
dimes
you
see
aunt
polly
does
feel
so
poor
it
a
shame
stormed
jimmy
i
know
it
but
honestly
i
think
she
feels
a
little
poorer
than
she
needs
to
she
brooded
over
it
so
but
i
do
wish
i
could
help
jimmy
looked
down
at
the
wistful
eager
face
with
its
luminous
eyes
and
his
own
eyes
softened
illustration
see
frontispiece
jimmy
looked
down
at
the
wistful
eager
face
what
do
you
want
to
do
if
you
could
do
it
he
asked
oh
i
want
to
cook
and
keep
house
smiled
pollyanna
with
a
pensive
sigh
i
just
love
to
beat
eggs
and
sugar
and
hear
the
soda
gurgle
its
little
tune
in
the
cup
of
sour
milk
i
happy
if
i
got
a
baking
before
me
but
there
is
any
money
in
that
except
in
somebody
else
kitchen
of
course
and
i
i
do
exactly
love
it
well
enough
for
that
i
should
say
not
ejaculated
the
young
fellow
once
more
he
glanced
down
at
the
expressive
face
so
near
him
this
time
a
queer
look
came
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
pursed
his
lips
then
spoke
a
slow
red
mounting
to
his
forehead
well
of
course
you
might
marry
have
you
thought
of
that
miss
pollyanna
pollyanna
gave
a
merry
laugh
voice
and
manner
were
unmistakably
those
of
a
girl
quite
untouched
by
even
the
most
of
darts
oh
no
i
shall
never
marry
she
said
blithely
in
the
first
place
i
not
pretty
you
know
and
in
the
second
place
i
going
to
live
with
aunt
polly
and
take
care
of
her
not
pretty
eh
smiled
pendleton
quizzically
did
it
ever
er
occur
to
you
that
there
might
be
a
difference
of
opinion
on
that
pollyanna
pollyanna
shook
her
head
there
could
be
i
got
a
mirror
you
see
she
objected
with
a
merry
glance
it
sounded
like
coquetry
in
any
other
girl
it
would
have
been
coquetry
pendleton
decided
but
looking
into
the
face
before
him
now
pendleton
knew
that
it
was
not
coquetry
he
knew
too
suddenly
why
pollyanna
had
seemed
so
different
from
any
girl
he
had
ever
known
something
of
her
old
literal
way
of
looking
at
things
still
clung
to
her
why
are
you
pretty
he
asked
even
as
he
uttered
the
question
and
sure
as
he
was
of
his
estimate
of
pollyanna
character
pendleton
quite
held
his
breath
at
his
temerity
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
how
quickly
any
other
girl
he
knew
would
have
resented
that
implied
acceptance
of
her
claim
to
no
beauty
but
pollyanna
first
words
showed
him
that
even
this
lurking
fear
of
his
was
quite
groundless
why
i
just
am
not
she
laughed
a
little
ruefully
i
was
made
that
way
maybe
you
do
remember
but
long
ago
when
i
was
a
little
girl
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
the
nicest
things
heaven
was
going
to
give
me
when
i
got
there
was
black
curls
and
is
that
your
chief
desire
now
maybe
not
hesitated
pollyanna
but
i
still
think
i
like
them
besides
my
eyelashes
are
long
enough
and
my
nose
grecian
or
roman
or
any
of
those
delightfully
desirable
ones
that
belong
to
a
it
just
nose
and
my
face
is
too
long
or
too
short
i
forgotten
which
but
i
measured
it
once
with
one
of
those
tests
and
it
was
right
anyhow
and
they
said
the
width
of
the
face
should
be
equal
to
five
eyes
and
the
width
of
the
eyes
equal
to
to
something
else
i
forgotten
that
too
only
that
mine
was
what
a
lugubrious
picture
laughed
pendleton
then
with
his
gaze
admiringly
regarding
the
girl
animated
face
and
expressive
eyes
he
asked
did
you
ever
look
in
the
mirror
when
you
were
talking
pollyanna
why
no
of
course
not
well
you
better
try
it
sometime
what
a
funny
idea
imagine
my
doing
it
laughed
the
girl
what
shall
i
say
like
this
you
pollyanna
what
if
your
eyelashes
are
long
and
your
nose
is
just
a
nose
be
glad
you
got
some
eyelashes
and
some
nose
pendleton
joined
in
her
laugh
but
an
odd
expression
came
to
his
face
then
you
still
play
the
game
he
said
a
little
diffidently
pollyanna
turned
soft
eyes
of
wonder
full
upon
him
why
of
course
why
jimmy
i
do
believe
i
could
have
lived
the
last
six
months
if
it
had
been
for
that
blessed
game
her
voice
shook
a
little
i
have
heard
you
say
much
about
it
he
commented
she
changed
color
i
know
i
think
i
afraid
of
saying
too
much
to
outsiders
who
do
care
you
know
it
would
sound
quite
the
same
from
me
now
at
twenty
as
it
did
when
i
was
ten
i
realize
that
of
course
folks
do
like
to
be
preached
at
you
know
she
finished
with
a
whimsical
smile
i
know
nodded
the
young
fellow
gravely
but
i
wonder
sometimes
pollyanna
if
you
really
understand
yourself
what
that
game
is
and
what
it
has
done
for
those
who
are
playing
it
i
know
what
it
has
done
for
myself
her
voice
was
low
and
her
eyes
were
turned
away
you
see
it
really
works
if
you
play
it
he
mused
aloud
after
a
short
silence
somebody
said
once
that
it
would
revolutionize
the
world
if
everybody
would
really
play
it
and
i
believe
it
would
yes
but
some
folks
do
want
to
be
revolutionized
smiled
pollyanna
i
ran
across
a
man
in
germany
last
year
he
had
lost
his
money
and
was
in
hard
luck
generally
dear
dear
but
he
was
gloomy
somebody
in
my
presence
tried
to
cheer
him
up
one
day
by
saying
come
things
might
be
worse
you
know
dear
dear
but
you
should
have
heard
that
man
then
there
is
anything
on
earth
that
makes
me
mad
clear
through
he
snarled
is
to
be
told
that
things
might
be
worse
and
to
be
thankful
for
what
i
got
left
these
people
who
go
around
with
an
everlasting
grin
on
their
faces
caroling
forth
that
they
are
thankful
that
they
can
breathe
or
eat
or
walk
or
lie
down
i
have
no
use
for
i
do
want
to
breathe
or
eat
or
walk
or
lie
down
if
things
are
as
they
are
now
with
me
and
when
i
told
that
i
ought
to
be
thankful
for
some
such
tommyrot
as
that
it
makes
me
just
want
to
go
out
and
shoot
somebody
imagine
what
i
have
gotten
if
i
have
introduced
the
glad
game
to
that
man
laughed
pollyanna
i
do
care
he
needed
it
answered
jimmy
of
course
he
did
but
he
would
have
thanked
me
for
giving
it
to
him
i
suppose
not
but
listen
as
he
was
under
his
present
philosophy
and
scheme
of
living
he
made
himself
and
everybody
else
wretched
did
he
well
just
suppose
he
was
playing
the
game
while
he
was
trying
to
hunt
up
something
to
be
glad
about
in
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
he
could
be
at
the
same
time
grumbling
and
growling
about
how
bad
things
were
so
that
much
would
be
gained
be
a
whole
lot
easier
to
live
with
both
for
himself
and
for
his
friends
meanwhile
just
thinking
of
the
doughnut
instead
of
the
hole
could
make
things
any
worse
for
him
and
it
might
make
things
better
for
it
would
give
him
such
a
gone
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
his
digestion
would
be
better
i
tell
you
troubles
are
poor
things
to
hug
they
got
too
many
prickers
pollyanna
smiled
appreciatively
that
makes
me
think
of
what
i
told
a
poor
old
lady
once
she
was
one
of
my
ladies
aiders
out
west
and
was
one
of
the
kind
of
people
that
really
enjoys
being
miserable
and
telling
over
her
causes
for
unhappiness
i
was
perhaps
ten
years
old
and
was
trying
to
teach
her
the
game
i
reckon
i
was
having
very
good
success
and
evidently
i
at
last
dimly
realized
the
reason
for
i
said
to
her
triumphantly
anyhow
you
can
be
glad
you
got
such
a
lot
of
things
to
make
you
miserable
for
you
love
to
be
miserable
so
well
well
if
that
was
a
good
one
on
her
chuckled
jimmy
pollyanna
raised
her
eyebrows
i
afraid
she
did
enjoy
it
any
more
than
the
man
in
germany
would
have
if
i
told
him
the
same
thing
but
they
ought
to
be
told
and
you
ought
to
tell
pendleton
stopped
short
with
so
queer
an
expression
on
his
face
that
pollyanna
looked
at
him
in
surprise
why
jimmy
what
is
it
oh
nothing
i
was
only
thinking
he
answered
puckering
his
lips
here
i
am
urging
you
to
do
the
very
thing
i
was
afraid
you
would
do
before
i
saw
you
you
know
that
is
i
was
afraid
before
i
saw
you
that
that
he
floundered
into
a
helpless
pause
looking
very
red
indeed
well
jimmy
pendleton
bridled
the
girl
you
need
think
you
can
stop
there
sir
now
just
what
do
you
mean
by
all
that
please
oh
er
much
i
waiting
murmured
pollyanna
voice
and
manner
were
calm
and
confident
though
the
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
the
young
fellow
hesitated
glanced
at
her
smiling
face
and
capitulated
oh
well
have
it
your
own
way
he
shrugged
it
only
that
i
was
worrying
a
little
about
that
game
for
fear
you
would
talk
it
just
as
you
used
to
you
know
and
but
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
interrupted
him
there
what
did
i
tell
you
even
you
were
worried
it
seems
lest
i
should
be
at
twenty
just
what
i
was
at
ten
i
did
mean
pollyanna
honestly
i
thought
of
course
i
knew
but
pollyanna
only
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
went
off
into
another
peal
of
laughter
chapter
xix
two
letters
it
was
toward
the
latter
part
of
june
that
the
letter
came
to
pollyanna
from
della
wetherby
i
am
writing
to
ask
you
a
favor
miss
wetherby
wrote
i
am
hoping
you
can
tell
me
of
some
quiet
private
family
in
beldingsville
that
will
be
willing
to
take
my
sister
to
board
for
the
summer
there
would
be
three
of
them
carew
her
secretary
and
her
adopted
son
jamie
you
remember
jamie
do
you
they
do
not
like
to
go
to
an
ordinary
hotel
or
boarding
house
my
sister
is
very
tired
and
the
doctor
has
advised
her
to
go
into
the
country
for
a
complete
rest
and
change
he
suggested
vermont
or
new
hampshire
we
immediately
thought
of
beldingsville
and
you
and
we
wondered
if
you
could
recommend
just
the
right
place
to
us
i
told
ruth
i
would
write
you
they
would
like
to
go
right
away
early
in
july
if
possible
would
it
be
asking
too
much
to
request
you
to
let
us
know
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
if
you
do
know
of
a
place
please
address
me
here
my
sister
is
with
us
here
at
the
sanatorium
for
a
few
weeks
treatment
hoping
for
a
favorable
reply
i
am
most
cordially
yours
della
wetherby
for
the
first
few
minutes
after
the
letter
was
finished
pollyanna
sat
with
frowning
brow
mentally
searching
the
homes
of
beldingsville
for
a
possible
boarding
house
for
her
old
friends
then
a
sudden
something
gave
her
thoughts
a
new
turn
and
with
a
joyous
exclamation
she
hurried
to
her
aunt
in
the
auntie
auntie
she
panted
i
got
just
the
loveliest
idea
i
told
you
something
would
happen
and
that
i
develop
that
wonderful
talent
sometime
well
i
have
i
have
right
now
listen
i
had
a
letter
from
miss
wetherby
carew
sister
where
i
stayed
that
winter
in
boston
you
know
and
they
want
to
come
into
the
country
to
board
for
the
summer
and
miss
wetherby
written
to
see
if
i
know
a
place
for
them
they
do
want
a
hotel
or
an
ordinary
boarding
house
you
see
and
at
first
i
did
know
of
one
but
now
i
do
i
do
aunt
polly
just
guess
where
is
dear
me
child
ejaculated
chilton
how
you
do
run
on
i
should
think
you
were
a
dozen
years
old
instead
of
a
woman
grown
now
what
are
you
talking
about
about
a
boarding
place
for
carew
and
jamie
i
found
it
babbled
pollyanna
indeed
well
what
of
it
of
what
possible
interest
can
that
be
to
me
child
murmured
chilton
drearily
because
it
here
i
going
to
have
them
here
auntie
pollyanna
chilton
was
sitting
erect
in
horror
now
auntie
please
do
say
no
please
do
begged
pollyanna
eagerly
do
you
see
this
is
my
chance
the
chance
i
been
waiting
for
and
it
just
dropped
right
into
my
hands
we
can
do
it
lovely
we
have
plenty
of
room
and
you
know
i
can
cook
and
keep
house
and
now
there
be
money
in
it
for
they
pay
well
i
know
and
they
love
to
come
i
sure
there
be
three
of
them
there
a
secretary
with
them
but
pollyanna
i
ca
turn
this
house
into
a
boarding
house
the
harrington
homestead
a
common
boarding
house
oh
pollyanna
i
ca
i
ca
but
it
would
be
a
common
boarding
house
dear
be
an
uncommon
one
besides
they
our
friends
it
would
be
like
having
our
friends
come
to
see
us
only
they
be
paying
guests
so
meanwhile
we
be
earning
money
money
that
we
need
auntie
money
that
we
need
she
emphasized
significantly
a
spasm
of
hurt
pride
crossed
polly
chilton
face
with
a
low
moan
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
but
how
could
you
do
it
she
asked
at
last
faintly
you
do
the
work
part
alone
child
oh
no
of
course
not
chirped
pollyanna
pollyanna
was
on
sure
ground
now
she
knew
her
point
was
won
but
i
could
do
the
cooking
and
the
overseeing
and
i
sure
i
could
get
one
of
nancy
younger
sisters
to
help
about
the
rest
durgin
would
do
the
laundry
part
just
as
she
does
now
but
pollyanna
i
not
well
at
all
you
know
i
not
i
could
do
much
of
course
not
there
no
reason
why
you
should
scorned
pollyanna
loftily
oh
auntie
wo
it
be
splendid
why
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
money
just
dropped
into
my
hands
like
that
dropped
into
your
hands
indeed
you
still
have
some
things
to
learn
in
this
world
pollyanna
and
one
is
that
summer
boarders
do
drop
money
into
anybody
hands
without
looking
very
sharply
to
it
that
they
get
ample
return
by
the
time
you
fetch
and
carry
and
bake
and
brew
until
you
are
ready
to
sink
and
by
the
time
you
nearly
kill
yourself
trying
to
serve
everything
to
order
from
eggs
to
the
weather
you
will
believe
what
i
tell
you
all
right
i
remember
laughed
pollyanna
but
i
not
doing
any
worrying
now
and
i
going
to
hurry
and
write
miss
wetherby
at
once
so
i
can
give
it
to
jimmy
bean
to
mail
when
he
comes
out
this
afternoon
chilton
stirred
restlessly
pollyanna
i
do
wish
you
call
that
young
man
by
his
proper
name
that
gives
me
the
shivers
his
name
is
now
as
i
understand
it
so
it
is
agreed
pollyanna
but
i
do
forget
it
half
the
time
i
even
call
him
that
to
his
face
sometimes
and
of
course
dreadful
when
he
really
is
adopted
and
all
but
you
see
i
so
excited
she
finished
as
she
danced
from
the
room
she
had
the
letter
all
ready
for
jimmy
when
he
called
at
four
she
was
still
quivering
with
excitement
and
she
lost
no
time
in
telling
her
visitor
what
it
was
all
about
and
i
crazy
to
see
them
besides
she
cried
when
she
had
told
him
of
her
plans
i
never
seen
either
of
them
since
that
winter
you
know
i
told
you
did
i
tell
you
about
jamie
oh
yes
you
told
me
there
was
a
touch
of
constraint
in
the
young
man
voice
well
is
it
splendid
if
they
can
come
why
i
do
know
as
i
should
call
it
exactly
splendid
he
parried
not
splendid
that
i
got
such
a
chance
to
help
aunt
polly
out
for
even
this
little
while
why
jimmy
of
course
it
splendid
well
it
strikes
me
that
it
going
to
be
rather
hard
for
you
bridled
jimmy
with
more
than
a
shade
of
irritation
yes
of
course
in
some
ways
but
i
shall
be
so
glad
for
the
money
coming
in
that
i
think
of
that
all
the
time
you
see
she
sighed
how
mercenary
i
am
jimmy
for
a
long
minute
there
was
no
reply
then
a
little
abruptly
the
young
man
asked
let
see
how
old
is
this
jamie
now
pollyanna
glanced
up
with
a
merry
smile
oh
i
remember
you
never
did
like
his
name
she
twinkled
never
mind
he
adopted
now
legally
i
believe
and
has
taken
the
name
of
carew
so
you
can
call
him
that
but
that
is
telling
me
how
old
he
is
reminded
jimmy
stiffly
nobody
knows
exactly
i
suppose
you
know
he
could
tell
but
i
imagine
he
about
your
age
i
wonder
how
he
is
now
i
asked
all
about
it
in
this
letter
anyway
oh
you
have
pendleton
looked
down
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
flipped
it
a
little
spitefully
he
was
thinking
that
he
would
like
to
drop
it
to
tear
it
up
to
give
it
to
somebody
to
throw
it
away
to
do
anything
with
it
but
mail
it
jimmy
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
jealous
that
he
always
had
been
jealous
of
this
youth
with
the
name
so
like
and
yet
so
unlike
his
own
not
that
he
was
in
love
with
pollyanna
he
assured
himself
wrathfully
he
was
not
that
of
course
it
was
just
that
he
did
not
care
to
have
this
strange
youth
with
the
sissy
name
come
to
beldingsville
and
be
always
around
to
spoil
all
their
good
times
he
almost
said
as
much
to
pollyanna
but
something
stayed
the
words
on
his
lips
and
after
a
time
he
took
his
leave
carrying
the
letter
with
him
that
jimmy
did
not
drop
the
letter
tear
it
up
give
it
to
anybody
or
throw
it
away
was
evidenced
a
few
days
later
for
pollyanna
received
a
prompt
and
delighted
reply
from
miss
wetherby
and
when
jimmy
came
next
time
he
heard
it
read
or
rather
he
heard
part
of
it
for
pollyanna
prefaced
the
reading
by
saying
of
course
the
first
part
is
just
where
she
says
how
glad
they
are
to
come
and
all
that
i
wo
read
that
but
the
rest
i
thought
like
to
hear
because
you
heard
me
talk
so
much
about
them
besides
you
know
them
yourself
pretty
soon
of
course
depending
a
whole
lot
on
you
jimmy
to
help
me
make
it
pleasant
for
them
oh
are
you
now
do
be
sarcastic
just
because
you
do
like
jamie
name
reproved
pollyanna
with
mock
severity
you
like
him
i
sure
when
you
know
him
and
you
love
mrs
carew
will
i
indeed
retorted
jimmy
huffily
well
that
is
a
serious
prospect
let
us
hope
if
i
do
the
lady
will
be
so
gracious
as
to
reciprocate
of
course
dimpled
pollyanna
now
listen
and
i
read
to
you
about
her
this
letter
is
from
her
sister
della
miss
wetherby
you
know
at
the
sanatorium
all
right
go
ahead
directed
jimmy
with
a
somewhat
too
evident
attempt
at
polite
interest
and
pollyanna
still
smiling
mischievously
began
to
read
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
everything
about
everybody
that
is
a
large
commission
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
to
begin
with
i
think
find
my
sister
quite
changed
the
new
interests
that
have
come
into
her
life
during
the
last
six
years
have
done
wonders
for
her
just
now
she
is
a
bit
thin
and
tired
from
overwork
but
a
good
rest
will
soon
remedy
that
and
you
see
how
young
and
blooming
and
happy
she
looks
please
notice
i
said
happy
that
wo
mean
so
much
to
you
as
it
does
to
me
of
course
for
you
were
too
young
to
realize
quite
how
unhappy
she
was
when
you
first
knew
her
that
winter
in
boston
life
was
such
a
dreary
hopeless
thing
to
her
then
and
now
it
is
so
full
of
interest
and
joy
first
she
has
jamie
and
when
you
see
them
together
you
wo
need
to
be
told
what
he
is
to
her
to
be
sure
we
are
no
nearer
knowing
whether
he
is
the
real
jamie
or
not
but
my
sister
loves
him
like
an
own
son
now
and
has
legally
adopted
him
as
i
presume
you
know
then
she
has
her
girls
do
you
remember
sadie
dean
the
salesgirl
well
from
getting
interested
in
her
and
trying
to
help
her
to
a
happier
living
my
sister
has
broadened
her
efforts
little
by
little
until
she
has
scores
of
girls
now
who
regard
her
as
their
own
best
and
particular
good
angel
she
has
started
a
home
for
working
girls
along
new
lines
half
a
dozen
wealthy
and
influential
men
and
women
are
associated
with
her
of
course
but
she
is
head
and
shoulders
of
the
whole
thing
and
never
hesitates
to
give
herself
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
girls
you
can
imagine
what
that
means
in
nerve
strain
her
chief
support
and
man
is
her
secretary
this
same
sadie
dean
you
find
her
changed
too
yet
she
is
the
same
old
sadie
as
for
jamie
poor
jamie
the
great
sorrow
of
his
life
is
that
he
knows
now
he
can
never
walk
for
a
time
we
all
had
hopes
he
was
here
at
the
sanatorium
under
ames
for
a
year
and
he
improved
to
such
an
extent
that
he
can
go
now
with
crutches
but
the
poor
boy
will
always
be
a
cripple
so
far
as
his
feet
are
concerned
but
never
as
regards
anything
else
someway
after
you
know
jamie
you
seldom
think
of
him
as
a
cripple
his
soul
is
so
free
i
ca
explain
it
but
you
know
what
i
mean
when
you
see
him
and
he
has
retained
to
a
marvelous
degree
his
old
boyish
enthusiasm
and
joy
of
living
there
is
just
one
thing
and
only
one
i
believe
that
would
utterly
quench
that
bright
spirit
and
cast
him
into
utter
despair
and
that
is
to
find
that
he
is
not
jamie
kent
our
nephew
so
long
has
he
brooded
over
this
and
so
ardently
has
he
wished
it
that
he
has
come
actually
to
believe
that
he
is
the
real
jamie
but
if
he
is
i
hope
he
will
never
find
it
out
there
that
all
she
says
about
them
announced
pollyanna
folding
up
the
sheets
in
her
hands
but
is
that
interesting
indeed
it
is
there
was
a
ring
of
genuineness
in
jimmy
voice
now
jimmy
was
thinking
suddenly
of
what
his
own
good
legs
meant
to
him
he
even
for
the
moment
was
willing
that
this
poor
crippled
youth
should
have
a
part
of
pollyanna
thoughts
and
attentions
if
he
were
not
so
presuming
as
to
claim
too
much
of
them
of
course
by
george
it
is
tough
for
the
poor
chap
and
no
mistake
tough
you
do
know
anything
about
it
jimmy
bean
choked
pollyanna
but
do
could
walk
once
know
yes
of
course
of
course
frowned
the
youth
moving
restively
in
his
seat
jimmy
looking
into
pollyanna
sympathetic
face
and
brimming
eyes
was
suddenly
not
so
sure
after
all
that
he
was
willing
to
have
this
jamie
come
to
town
if
just
to
think
of
him
made
pollyanna
look
like
that
chapter
xx
the
paying
guests
the
few
intervening
days
before
the
expected
arrival
of
those
dreadful
people
as
aunt
polly
termed
her
niece
paying
guests
were
busy
ones
indeed
for
pollyanna
but
they
were
happy
ones
too
as
pollyanna
refused
to
be
weary
or
discouraged
or
dismayed
no
matter
how
puzzling
were
the
daily
problems
she
had
to
meet
summoning
nancy
and
nancy
younger
sister
betty
to
her
aid
pollyanna
systematically
went
through
the
house
room
by
room
and
arranged
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
her
expected
boarders
chilton
could
do
but
little
to
assist
in
the
first
place
she
was
not
well
in
the
second
place
her
mental
attitude
toward
the
whole
idea
was
not
conducive
to
aid
or
comfort
for
at
her
side
stalked
always
the
harrington
pride
of
name
and
race
and
on
her
lips
was
the
constant
moan
oh
pollyanna
pollyanna
to
think
of
the
harrington
homestead
ever
coming
to
this
it
is
dearie
pollyanna
at
last
soothed
laughingly
it
the
carews
that
are
coming
to
the
harrington
homestead
but
chilton
was
not
to
be
so
lightly
diverted
and
responded
only
with
a
scornful
glance
and
a
deeper
sigh
so
pollyanna
was
forced
to
leave
her
to
travel
alone
her
road
of
determined
gloom
upon
the
appointed
day
pollyanna
with
timothy
who
owned
the
harrington
horses
now
went
to
the
station
to
meet
the
afternoon
train
up
to
this
hour
there
had
been
nothing
but
confidence
and
joyous
anticipation
in
pollyanna
heart
but
with
the
whistle
of
the
engine
there
came
to
her
a
veritable
panic
of
doubt
shyness
and
dismay
she
realized
suddenly
what
she
pollyanna
almost
alone
and
unaided
was
about
to
do
she
remembered
carew
wealth
position
and
fastidious
tastes
she
recollected
too
that
this
would
be
a
new
tall
jamie
quite
unlike
the
boy
she
had
known
for
one
awful
moment
she
thought
only
of
getting
away
somewhere
anywhere
timothy
i
i
feel
sick
i
not
well
i
tell
er
not
to
come
she
faltered
poising
as
if
for
flight
exclaimed
the
startled
timothy
one
glance
into
timothy
amazed
face
was
enough
pollyanna
laughed
and
threw
back
her
shoulders
alertly
nothing
never
mind
i
did
mean
it
of
course
timothy
quick
see
they
almost
here
she
panted
and
pollyanna
hurried
forward
quite
herself
once
more
she
knew
them
at
once
even
had
there
been
any
doubt
in
her
mind
the
crutches
in
the
hands
of
the
tall
young
man
would
have
piloted
her
straight
to
her
goal
there
were
a
brief
few
minutes
of
eager
handclasps
and
incoherent
exclamations
then
somehow
she
found
herself
in
the
carriage
with
carew
at
her
side
and
jamie
and
sadie
dean
in
front
she
had
a
chance
then
for
the
first
time
really
to
see
her
friends
and
to
note
the
changes
the
six
years
had
wrought
in
regard
to
carew
her
first
feeling
was
one
of
surprise
she
had
forgotten
that
carew
was
so
lovely
she
had
forgotten
that
the
eyelashes
were
so
long
that
the
eyes
they
shaded
were
so
beautiful
she
even
caught
herself
thinking
enviously
of
how
exactly
that
perfect
face
must
tally
figure
by
figure
with
that
dread
but
more
than
anything
else
she
rejoiced
in
the
absence
of
the
old
fretful
lines
of
gloom
and
bitterness
then
she
turned
to
jamie
here
again
she
was
surprised
and
for
much
the
same
reason
jamie
too
had
grown
handsome
to
herself
pollyanna
declared
that
he
was
really
distinguished
looking
his
dark
eyes
rather
pale
face
and
dark
waving
hair
she
thought
most
attractive
then
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
crutches
at
his
side
and
a
spasm
of
aching
sympathy
contracted
her
throat
from
jamie
pollyanna
turned
to
sadie
dean
sadie
so
far
as
features
went
looked
much
as
she
had
when
pollyanna
first
saw
her
in
the
public
garden
but
pollyanna
did
not
need
a
second
glance
to
know
that
sadie
so
far
as
hair
dress
temper
speech
and
disposition
were
concerned
was
a
very
different
sadie
indeed
then
jamie
spoke
how
good
you
were
to
let
us
come
he
said
to
pollyanna
do
you
know
what
i
thought
of
when
you
wrote
that
we
could
come
why
of
course
not
stammered
pollyanna
pollyanna
was
still
seeing
the
crutches
at
jamie
side
and
her
throat
was
still
tightened
from
that
aching
sympathy
well
i
thought
of
the
little
maid
in
the
public
garden
with
her
bag
of
peanuts
for
sir
lancelot
and
lady
guinevere
and
i
knew
that
you
were
just
putting
us
in
their
places
for
if
you
had
a
bag
of
peanuts
and
we
had
none
you
would
be
happy
till
you
shared
it
with
us
a
bag
of
peanuts
indeed
laughed
pollyanna
oh
of
course
in
this
case
your
bag
of
peanuts
happened
to
be
airy
country
rooms
and
cow
milk
and
real
eggs
from
a
real
hen
nest
returned
jamie
whimsically
but
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
and
maybe
i
better
warn
you
you
remember
how
greedy
sir
lancelot
was
well
he
paused
meaningly
all
right
i
take
the
risk
dimpled
pollyanna
thinking
how
glad
she
was
that
aunt
polly
was
not
present
to
hear
her
worst
predictions
so
nearly
fulfilled
thus
early
poor
sir
lancelot
i
wonder
if
anybody
feeds
him
now
or
if
he
there
at
all
well
if
he
there
he
fed
interposed
carew
merrily
this
ridiculous
boy
still
goes
down
there
at
least
once
a
week
with
his
pockets
bulging
with
peanuts
and
i
do
know
what
all
he
can
be
traced
any
time
by
the
trail
of
small
grains
he
leaves
behind
him
and
half
the
time
when
i
order
my
cereal
for
breakfast
it
forthcoming
because
forsooth
jamie
has
fed
it
to
the
pigeons
yes
but
let
me
tell
you
plunged
in
jamie
enthusiastically
and
the
next
minute
pollyanna
found
herself
listening
with
all
the
old
fascination
to
a
story
of
a
couple
of
squirrels
in
a
sunlit
garden
later
she
saw
what
della
wetherby
had
meant
in
her
letter
for
when
the
house
was
reached
it
came
as
a
distinct
shock
to
her
to
see
jamie
pick
up
his
crutches
and
swing
himself
out
of
the
carriage
with
their
aid
she
knew
then
that
already
in
ten
short
minutes
he
had
made
her
forget
that
he
was
lame
to
pollyanna
great
relief
that
first
dreaded
meeting
between
aunt
polly
and
the
carew
party
passed
off
much
better
than
she
had
feared
the
newcomers
were
so
frankly
delighted
with
the
old
house
and
everything
in
it
that
it
was
an
utter
impossibility
for
the
mistress
and
owner
of
it
all
to
continue
her
stiff
attitude
of
disapproving
resignation
to
their
presence
besides
as
was
plainly
evident
before
an
hour
had
passed
the
personal
charm
and
magnetism
of
jamie
had
pierced
even
aunt
polly
armor
of
distrust
and
pollyanna
knew
that
at
least
one
of
her
own
most
dreaded
problems
was
a
problem
no
longer
for
already
aunt
polly
was
beginning
to
play
the
stately
yet
gracious
hostess
to
these
her
guests
notwithstanding
her
relief
at
aunt
polly
change
of
attitude
however
pollyanna
did
not
find
that
all
was
smooth
sailing
by
any
means
there
was
work
and
plenty
of
it
that
must
be
done
sister
betty
was
pleasant
and
willing
but
she
was
not
nancy
as
pollyanna
soon
found
she
needed
training
and
training
took
time
pollyanna
worried
too
for
fear
everything
should
not
be
quite
right
to
pollyanna
those
days
a
dusty
chair
was
a
crime
and
a
fallen
cake
a
tragedy
gradually
however
after
incessant
arguments
and
pleadings
on
the
part
of
carew
and
jamie
pollyanna
came
to
take
her
tasks
more
easily
and
to
realize
that
the
real
crime
and
tragedy
in
her
eyes
was
not
the
dusty
chair
nor
the
fallen
cake
but
the
frown
of
worry
and
anxiety
on
her
own
face
just
as
if
it
was
enough
for
you
to
let
us
come
jamie
declared
without
just
killing
yourself
with
work
to
get
us
something
to
eat
besides
we
ought
not
to
eat
so
much
anyway
carew
laughed
or
else
we
shall
get
as
one
of
my
girls
calls
it
when
her
food
disagrees
with
her
it
was
wonderful
after
all
how
easily
the
three
new
members
of
the
family
fitted
into
the
daily
life
before
hours
had
passed
carew
had
gotten
chilton
to
asking
really
interested
questions
about
the
new
home
for
working
girls
and
sadie
dean
and
jamie
were
quarreling
over
the
chance
to
help
with
the
or
the
the
carews
had
been
at
the
harrington
homestead
nearly
a
week
when
one
evening
john
pendleton
and
jimmy
called
pollyanna
had
been
hoping
they
would
come
soon
she
had
indeed
urged
it
very
strongly
before
the
carews
came
she
made
the
introductions
now
with
visible
pride
you
are
such
good
friends
of
mine
i
want
you
to
know
each
other
and
be
good
friends
together
she
explained
that
jimmy
and
pendleton
should
be
clearly
impressed
with
the
charm
and
beauty
of
carew
did
not
surprise
pollyanna
in
the
least
but
the
look
that
came
into
carew
face
at
sight
of
jimmy
did
surprise
her
very
much
it
was
almost
a
look
of
recognition
why
pendleton
have
i
met
you
before
carew
cried
jimmy
frank
eyes
met
carew
gaze
squarely
admiringly
i
think
not
he
smiled
back
at
her
i
sure
i
never
have
met
you
i
should
have
remembered
it
if
had
met
you
he
bowed
so
unmistakable
was
his
significant
emphasis
that
everybody
laughed
and
john
pendleton
chuckled
well
done
son
for
a
youth
of
your
tender
years
i
could
have
done
half
so
well
myself
carew
flushed
slightly
and
joined
in
the
laugh
no
but
really
she
urged
joking
aside
there
certainly
is
a
strangely
familiar
something
in
your
face
i
think
i
must
have
seen
you
somewhere
if
i
have
actually
met
you
and
maybe
you
have
cried
pollyanna
in
boston
jimmy
goes
to
tech
there
winters
you
know
jimmy
going
to
build
bridges
and
dams
you
see
when
he
grows
up
i
mean
she
finished
with
a
merry
glance
at
the
big
fellow
still
standing
before
carew
everybody
laughed
again
that
is
everybody
but
jamie
and
only
sadie
dean
noticed
that
jamie
instead
of
laughing
closed
his
eyes
as
if
at
the
sight
of
something
that
hurt
and
only
sadie
dean
knew
how
and
why
the
subject
was
so
quickly
changed
for
it
was
sadie
herself
who
changed
it
it
was
sadie
too
who
when
the
opportunity
came
saw
to
it
that
books
and
flowers
and
beasts
and
birds
things
that
jamie
knew
and
understood
were
talked
about
as
well
as
dams
and
bridges
which
as
sadie
knew
jamie
could
never
build
that
sadie
did
all
this
however
was
not
realized
by
anybody
least
of
all
by
jamie
the
one
who
most
of
all
was
concerned
when
the
call
was
over
and
the
pendletons
had
gone
carew
referred
again
to
the
curiously
haunting
feeling
that
somewhere
she
had
seen
young
pendleton
before
i
have
i
know
i
have
somewhere
she
declared
musingly
of
course
it
may
have
been
in
boston
but
she
let
the
sentence
remain
unfinished
then
after
a
minute
she
added
he
a
fine
young
fellow
anyway
i
like
him
i
so
glad
i
do
too
nodded
pollyanna
i
always
liked
jimmy
you
known
him
some
time
then
queried
jamie
a
little
wistfully
oh
yes
i
knew
him
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
girl
you
know
he
was
jimmy
bean
then
jimmy
bean
why
is
he
pendleton
son
asked
carew
in
surprise
no
only
by
adoption
adoption
exclaimed
jamie
then
he
is
a
real
son
any
more
than
i
am
there
was
a
curious
note
of
almost
joy
in
the
lad
voice
no
pendleton
has
any
children
he
never
married
he
he
was
going
to
once
but
he
he
did
pollyanna
blushed
and
spoke
with
sudden
diffidence
pollyanna
had
never
forgotten
that
it
was
her
mother
who
in
the
long
ago
had
said
no
to
this
same
john
pendleton
and
who
had
thus
been
responsible
for
the
man
long
lonely
years
of
bachelorhood
carew
and
jamie
however
being
unaware
of
this
and
seeing
now
only
the
blush
on
pollyanna
cheek
and
the
diffidence
in
her
manner
drew
suddenly
the
same
conclusion
is
it
possible
they
asked
themselves
that
this
man
john
pendleton
ever
had
a
love
affair
with
pollyanna
child
that
she
is
naturally
they
did
not
say
this
aloud
so
naturally
there
was
no
answer
possible
naturally
too
perhaps
the
thought
though
unspoken
was
still
not
forgotten
but
was
tucked
away
in
a
corner
of
their
minds
for
future
reference
if
need
arose
chapter
xxi
summer
days
before
the
carews
came
pollyanna
had
told
jimmy
that
she
was
depending
on
him
to
help
her
entertain
them
jimmy
had
not
expressed
himself
then
as
being
overwhelmingly
desirous
to
serve
her
in
this
way
but
before
the
carews
had
been
in
town
a
fortnight
he
had
shown
himself
as
not
only
willing
but
anxious
judging
by
the
frequency
and
length
of
his
calls
and
the
lavishness
of
his
offers
of
the
pendleton
horses
and
motor
cars
between
him
and
carew
there
sprang
up
at
once
a
warm
friendship
based
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
peculiarly
strong
attraction
for
each
other
they
walked
and
talked
together
and
even
made
sundry
plans
for
the
home
for
working
girls
to
be
carried
out
the
following
winter
when
jimmy
should
be
in
boston
jamie
too
came
in
for
a
good
measure
of
attention
nor
was
sadie
dean
forgotten
sadie
as
carew
plainly
showed
was
to
be
regarded
as
if
she
were
quite
one
of
the
family
and
carew
was
careful
to
see
that
she
had
full
share
in
any
plans
for
merrymaking
nor
did
jimmy
always
come
alone
with
his
offers
for
entertainment
more
and
more
frequently
john
pendleton
appeared
with
him
rides
and
drives
and
picnics
were
planned
and
carried
out
and
long
delightful
afternoons
were
spent
over
books
and
on
the
harrington
veranda
pollyanna
was
delighted
not
only
were
her
paying
guests
being
kept
from
any
possibilities
of
ennui
and
homesickness
but
her
good
friends
the
carews
were
becoming
delightfully
acquainted
with
her
other
good
friends
the
pendletons
so
like
a
mother
hen
with
a
brood
of
chickens
she
hovered
over
the
veranda
meetings
and
did
everything
in
her
power
to
keep
the
group
together
and
happy
neither
the
carews
nor
the
pendletons
however
were
at
all
satisfied
to
have
pollyanna
merely
an
onlooker
in
their
pastimes
and
very
strenuously
they
urged
her
to
join
them
they
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
indeed
and
pollyanna
very
frequently
found
the
way
opened
for
her
just
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
you
poked
up
in
this
hot
kitchen
frosting
cake
jamie
scolded
one
day
after
he
had
penetrated
the
fastnesses
of
her
domain
it
is
a
perfectly
glorious
morning
and
we
all
going
over
to
the
gorge
and
take
our
luncheon
and
you
are
going
with
us
but
jamie
i
ca
indeed
i
ca
refused
pollyanna
why
not
you
wo
have
dinner
to
get
for
us
for
we
be
here
to
eat
it
but
there
the
the
luncheon
wrong
again
we
have
the
luncheon
with
us
so
you
ca
stay
home
to
get
that
now
what
to
hinder
your
going
along
with
the
luncheon
eh
why
jamie
i
i
ca
there
the
cake
to
frost
do
want
it
frosted
and
the
dusting
do
want
it
dusted
and
the
ordering
to
do
for
give
us
crackers
and
milk
we
lots
rather
have
you
and
crackers
and
milk
than
a
turkey
dinner
and
not
you
but
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
the
things
i
got
to
do
do
want
you
to
begin
to
tell
me
retorted
jamie
cheerfully
i
want
you
to
stop
telling
me
come
put
on
your
bonnet
i
saw
betty
in
the
dining
room
and
she
says
she
put
our
luncheon
up
now
hurry
why
jamie
you
ridiculous
boy
i
ca
go
laughed
pollyanna
holding
feebly
back
as
he
tugged
at
her
i
ca
go
to
that
picnic
with
you
but
she
went
she
went
not
only
then
but
again
and
again
she
could
not
help
going
indeed
for
she
found
arrayed
against
her
not
only
jamie
but
jimmy
and
pendleton
to
say
nothing
of
carew
and
sadie
dean
and
even
aunt
polly
herself
and
of
course
i
am
glad
to
go
she
would
sigh
happily
when
some
dreary
bit
of
work
was
taken
out
of
her
hands
in
spite
of
all
protesting
but
surely
never
before
were
there
any
boarders
like
mine
teasing
for
and
cold
things
and
never
before
was
there
a
boarding
mistress
like
me
running
around
the
country
after
this
fashion
the
climax
came
when
one
day
john
pendleton
and
aunt
polly
never
ceased
to
exclaim
because
it
was
john
pendleton
suggested
that
they
all
go
on
a
two
weeks
camping
trip
to
a
little
lake
up
among
the
mountains
forty
miles
from
beldingsville
the
idea
was
received
with
enthusiastic
approbation
by
everybody
except
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
said
privately
to
pollyanna
that
it
was
all
very
good
and
well
and
desirable
that
john
pendleton
should
have
gotten
out
of
the
sour
morose
aloofness
that
had
been
his
state
for
so
many
years
but
that
it
did
not
necessarily
follow
that
it
was
equally
desirable
that
he
should
be
trying
to
turn
himself
into
a
boy
again
and
that
was
what
in
her
opinion
he
seemed
to
be
doing
now
publicly
she
contented
herself
with
saying
coldly
that
she
certainly
should
not
go
on
any
insane
camping
trip
to
sleep
on
damp
ground
and
eat
bugs
and
spiders
under
the
guise
of
fun
nor
did
she
think
it
a
sensible
thing
for
anybody
over
forty
to
do
if
john
pendleton
felt
any
wound
from
this
shaft
he
made
no
sign
certainly
there
was
no
diminution
of
apparent
interest
and
enthusiasm
on
his
part
and
the
plans
for
the
camping
expedition
came
on
apace
for
it
was
unanimously
decided
that
even
if
aunt
polly
would
not
go
that
was
no
reason
why
the
rest
should
not
and
carew
will
be
all
the
chaperon
we
need
anyhow
jimmy
had
declared
airily
for
a
week
therefore
little
was
talked
of
but
tents
food
supplies
cameras
and
fishing
tackle
and
little
was
done
that
was
not
a
preparation
in
some
way
for
the
trip
and
let
make
it
the
real
thing
proposed
jimmy
eagerly
yes
even
to
chilton
bugs
and
spiders
he
added
with
a
merry
smile
straight
into
that
lady
severely
disapproving
eyes
none
of
your
idea
for
us
we
want
real
with
potatoes
baked
in
the
ashes
and
we
want
to
sit
around
and
tell
stories
and
roast
corn
on
a
stick
and
we
want
to
swim
and
row
and
fish
chimed
in
pollyanna
and
she
stopped
suddenly
her
eyes
on
jamie
face
that
is
of
course
she
corrected
quickly
we
would
want
to
to
do
those
things
all
the
time
there
be
a
lot
of
quiet
things
we
want
to
do
too
read
and
talk
you
know
jamie
eyes
darkened
his
face
grew
a
little
white
his
lips
parted
but
before
any
words
came
sadie
dean
was
speaking
oh
but
on
camping
trips
and
picnics
you
know
we
expect
to
do
outdoor
stunts
she
interposed
feverishly
and
i
sure
we
want
to
last
summer
we
were
down
in
maine
and
you
should
have
seen
the
fish
carew
caught
it
was
you
tell
it
she
begged
turning
to
jamie
jamie
laughed
and
shook
his
head
they
never
believe
it
he
objected
a
fish
story
like
that
try
us
challenged
pollyanna
jamie
still
shook
his
head
but
the
color
had
come
back
to
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
no
longer
somber
as
if
with
pain
pollyanna
glancing
at
sadie
dean
vaguely
wondered
why
she
suddenly
settled
back
in
her
seat
with
so
very
evident
an
air
of
relief
at
last
the
appointed
day
came
and
the
start
was
made
in
john
pendleton
big
new
touring
car
with
jimmy
at
the
wheel
a
whir
a
throbbing
rumble
a
chorus
of
and
they
were
off
with
one
long
shriek
of
the
siren
under
jimmy
mischievous
fingers
in
after
days
pollyanna
often
went
back
in
her
thoughts
to
that
first
night
in
camp
the
experience
was
so
new
and
so
wonderful
in
so
many
ways
it
was
four
when
their
automobile
journey
came
to
an
end
since
three
their
big
car
had
been
ponderously
picking
its
way
over
an
old
not
designed
for
automobiles
for
the
car
itself
and
for
the
hand
at
the
wheel
this
part
of
the
trip
was
a
most
wearing
one
but
for
the
merry
passengers
who
had
no
responsibility
concerning
hidden
holes
and
muddy
curves
it
was
nothing
but
a
delight
growing
more
poignant
with
every
new
vista
through
the
green
arches
and
with
every
echoing
laugh
that
dodged
the
branches
the
site
for
the
camp
was
one
known
to
john
pendleton
years
before
and
he
greeted
it
now
with
a
satisfied
delight
that
was
not
unmingled
with
relief
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
chorused
the
others
glad
you
like
it
i
thought
it
would
be
about
right
nodded
john
pendleton
still
i
was
a
little
anxious
after
all
for
these
places
do
change
you
know
most
remarkably
sometimes
and
of
course
this
has
grown
up
to
bushes
a
little
but
not
so
but
what
we
can
easily
clear
it
everybody
fell
to
work
then
clearing
the
ground
putting
up
the
two
little
tents
unloading
the
automobile
building
the
camp
fire
and
arranging
the
kitchen
and
pantry
it
was
then
that
pollyanna
began
especially
to
notice
jamie
and
to
fear
for
him
she
realized
suddenly
that
the
hummocks
and
hollows
and
knolls
were
not
like
a
carpeted
floor
for
a
pair
of
crutches
and
she
saw
that
jamie
was
realizing
it
too
she
saw
also
that
in
spite
of
his
infirmity
he
was
trying
to
take
his
share
in
the
work
and
the
sight
troubled
her
twice
she
hurried
forward
and
intercepted
him
taking
from
his
arms
the
box
he
was
trying
to
carry
here
let
me
take
that
she
begged
you
done
enough
and
the
second
time
she
added
do
go
and
sit
down
somewhere
to
rest
jamie
you
look
so
tired
if
she
had
been
watching
closely
she
would
have
seen
the
quick
color
sweep
to
his
forehead
but
she
was
not
watching
so
she
did
not
see
it
she
did
see
however
to
her
intense
surprise
sadie
dean
hurry
forward
a
moment
later
her
arms
full
of
boxes
and
heard
her
cry
oh
carew
please
if
you
would
give
me
a
lift
with
these
the
next
moment
jamie
once
more
struggling
with
the
problem
of
managing
a
bundle
of
boxes
and
two
crutches
was
hastening
toward
the
tents
with
a
quick
word
of
protest
on
her
tongue
pollyanna
turned
to
sadie
dean
but
the
protest
died
unspoken
for
sadie
her
finger
to
her
lips
was
hurrying
straight
toward
her
i
know
you
did
think
she
stammered
in
a
low
voice
as
she
reached
pollyanna
side
but
do
you
see
it
hurts
him
to
have
you
think
he
ca
do
things
like
other
folks
there
look
see
how
happy
he
is
now
pollyanna
looked
and
she
saw
she
saw
jamie
his
whole
self
alert
deftly
balance
his
weight
on
one
crutch
and
swing
his
burden
to
the
ground
she
saw
the
happy
light
on
his
face
and
she
heard
him
say
nonchalantly
here
another
contribution
from
miss
dean
she
asked
me
to
bring
this
over
why
yes
i
see
breathed
pollyanna
turning
to
sadie
dean
but
sadie
dean
had
gone
pollyanna
watched
jamie
a
good
deal
after
that
though
she
was
careful
not
to
let
him
or
any
one
else
see
that
she
was
watching
him
and
as
she
watched
her
heart
ached
twice
she
saw
him
essay
a
task
and
fail
once
with
a
box
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift
once
with
a
too
unwieldy
for
him
to
carry
with
his
crutches
and
each
time
she
saw
his
quick
glance
about
him
to
see
if
others
noticed
she
saw
too
that
unmistakably
he
was
getting
very
tired
and
that
his
face
in
spite
of
its
gay
smile
was
looking
white
and
drawn
as
if
he
were
in
pain
i
should
think
we
might
have
known
more
stormed
pollyanna
hotly
to
herself
her
eyes
blinded
with
tears
i
should
think
we
might
have
known
more
than
to
have
let
him
come
to
a
place
like
this
camping
indeed
and
with
a
pair
of
crutches
why
could
we
have
remembered
before
we
started
an
hour
later
around
the
camp
fire
after
supper
pollyanna
had
her
answer
to
this
question
for
with
the
glowing
fire
before
her
and
the
soft
fragrant
dark
all
about
her
she
once
more
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
witchery
that
fell
from
jamie
lips
and
she
once
more
forgot
jamie
crutches
chapter
xxii
comrades
they
were
a
merry
party
the
six
of
them
and
a
congenial
one
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
new
delights
that
came
with
every
new
day
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
new
charm
of
companionship
that
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
this
new
life
they
were
living
as
jamie
said
one
night
when
they
were
all
sitting
about
the
fire
you
see
we
seem
to
know
each
other
so
much
better
up
here
in
the
woods
better
in
a
week
than
we
would
in
a
year
in
town
i
know
it
i
wonder
why
murmured
carew
her
eyes
dreamily
following
the
leaping
blaze
i
think
it
something
in
the
air
sighed
pollyanna
happily
there
something
about
the
sky
and
the
woods
and
the
lake
so
so
well
there
just
is
that
all
i
think
you
mean
because
the
world
is
shut
out
cried
sadie
dean
with
a
curious
little
break
in
her
voice
sadie
had
not
joined
in
the
laugh
that
followed
pollyanna
limping
conclusion
up
here
everything
is
so
real
and
true
that
we
too
can
be
our
real
true
selves
not
what
the
world
says
we
are
because
we
are
rich
or
poor
or
great
or
humble
but
what
we
really
are
ourselves
ho
scoffed
jimmy
airily
all
that
sounds
very
fine
but
the
real
reason
is
because
we
do
have
any
tom
and
dick
and
harry
sitting
on
their
side
porches
and
commenting
on
every
time
we
stir
and
wondering
among
themselves
where
we
are
going
why
we
are
going
there
and
how
long
we
intending
to
stay
oh
jimmy
how
you
do
take
the
poetry
out
of
things
reproached
pollyanna
laughingly
but
that
my
business
flashed
jimmy
how
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
build
dams
and
bridges
if
i
do
see
something
besides
poetry
in
the
waterfall
you
ca
pendleton
and
it
the
bridge
that
counts
every
time
declared
jamie
in
a
voice
that
brought
a
sudden
hush
to
the
group
about
the
fire
it
was
for
only
a
moment
however
for
almost
at
once
sadie
dean
broke
the
silence
with
a
gay
pooh
i
rather
have
the
waterfall
every
time
without
any
bridge
around
to
spoil
the
view
everybody
laughed
and
it
was
as
if
a
tension
somewhere
snapped
then
carew
rose
to
her
feet
come
come
children
your
stern
chaperon
says
it
bedtime
and
with
a
merry
chorus
of
the
party
broke
up
and
so
the
days
passed
to
pollyanna
they
were
wonderful
days
and
still
the
most
wonderful
part
was
the
charm
of
close
companionship
a
companionship
that
while
differing
as
to
details
with
each
one
was
yet
delightful
with
all
with
sadie
dean
she
talked
of
the
new
home
and
of
what
a
marvelous
work
carew
was
doing
they
talked
too
of
the
old
days
when
sadie
was
selling
bows
behind
the
counter
and
of
what
carew
had
done
for
her
pollyanna
heard
also
something
of
the
old
father
and
mother
back
home
and
of
the
joy
that
sadie
in
her
new
position
had
been
able
to
bring
into
their
lives
and
after
all
it
really
you
that
began
it
you
know
she
said
one
day
to
pollyanna
but
pollyanna
only
shook
her
head
at
this
with
an
emphatic
nonsense
it
was
all
mrs
carew
with
carew
herself
pollyanna
talked
also
of
the
home
and
of
her
plans
for
the
girls
and
once
in
the
hush
of
a
twilight
walk
carew
spoke
of
herself
and
of
her
changed
outlook
on
life
and
she
like
sadie
dean
said
brokenly
after
all
it
really
you
that
began
it
pollyanna
but
pollyanna
as
in
sadie
dean
case
would
have
none
of
this
and
she
began
to
talk
of
jamie
and
of
what
he
had
done
jamie
a
dear
carew
answered
affectionately
and
i
love
him
like
an
own
son
he
could
be
dearer
to
me
if
he
were
really
my
sister
boy
then
you
do
think
he
is
i
do
know
we
never
learned
anything
conclusive
sometimes
sure
he
is
then
again
i
doubt
it
i
think
he
really
believes
he
is
bless
his
heart
at
all
events
one
thing
is
sure
he
has
good
blood
in
him
from
somewhere
jamie
no
ordinary
waif
of
the
streets
you
know
with
his
talents
and
the
wonderful
way
he
has
responded
to
teaching
and
training
proves
it
of
course
nodded
pollyanna
and
as
long
as
you
love
him
so
well
it
does
really
matter
anyway
does
it
whether
he
the
real
jamie
or
not
carew
hesitated
into
her
eyes
crept
the
old
somberness
of
heartache
not
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
she
sighed
at
last
it
only
that
sometimes
i
get
to
thinking
if
he
is
our
jamie
where
is
jamie
kent
is
he
well
is
he
happy
has
he
any
one
to
love
him
when
i
get
to
thinking
like
that
pollyanna
i
nearly
wild
i
give
everything
i
have
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
to
really
know
that
this
boy
is
jamie
kent
pollyanna
used
to
think
of
this
conversation
sometimes
in
her
after
talks
with
jamie
jamie
was
so
sure
of
himself
it
just
somehow
that
i
feel
it
so
he
said
once
to
pollyanna
i
believe
i
am
jamie
kent
i
believed
it
quite
a
while
i
afraid
i
believed
it
so
long
now
that
that
i
just
could
bear
it
to
find
out
i
was
he
carew
has
done
so
much
for
me
just
think
if
after
all
i
were
only
a
stranger
but
she
loves
you
jamie
i
know
she
does
and
that
would
only
hurt
all
the
more
do
you
see
because
it
would
be
hurting
her
she
wants
me
to
be
the
real
jamie
i
know
she
does
now
if
i
could
only
do
something
for
her
make
her
proud
of
me
in
some
way
if
i
could
only
do
something
to
support
myself
even
like
a
man
but
what
can
i
do
with
these
he
spoke
bitterly
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
crutches
at
his
side
pollyanna
was
shocked
and
distressed
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
jamie
speak
of
his
infirmity
since
the
old
boyhood
days
frantically
she
cast
about
in
her
mind
for
just
the
right
thing
to
say
but
before
she
had
even
thought
of
anything
jamie
face
had
undergone
a
complete
change
but
there
forget
it
i
did
mean
to
say
it
he
cried
gaily
and
rank
heresy
to
the
game
was
it
i
sure
i
glad
i
got
the
crutches
they
a
whole
lot
nicer
than
the
wheel
chair
and
the
jolly
book
do
you
keep
it
now
asked
pollyanna
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
sure
i
got
a
whole
library
of
jolly
books
now
he
retorted
they
all
in
leather
dark
red
except
the
first
one
that
is
the
same
little
old
notebook
that
jerry
gave
me
jerry
and
i
been
meaning
all
the
time
to
ask
for
him
cried
pollyanna
where
is
he
in
boston
and
his
vocabulary
is
just
as
picturesque
as
ever
only
he
has
to
tone
it
down
at
times
jerry
still
in
the
newspaper
business
but
he
getting
the
news
not
selling
it
reporting
you
know
i
have
been
able
to
help
him
and
mumsey
and
do
you
suppose
i
was
glad
mumsey
in
a
sanatorium
for
her
rheumatism
and
is
she
better
very
much
she
coming
out
pretty
soon
and
going
to
housekeeping
with
jerry
jerry
been
making
up
some
of
his
lost
schooling
during
these
past
few
years
he
let
me
help
him
but
only
as
a
loan
been
very
particular
to
stipulate
that
of
course
nodded
pollyanna
in
approval
he
want
it
that
way
i
sure
i
should
it
is
nice
to
be
under
obligations
that
you
ca
pay
i
know
how
it
is
that
why
i
so
wish
i
could
help
aunt
polly
out
after
all
she
done
for
me
but
you
are
helping
her
this
summer
pollyanna
lifted
her
eyebrows
yes
i
keeping
summer
boarders
i
look
it
do
i
she
challenged
with
a
flourish
of
her
hands
toward
her
surroundings
surely
never
was
a
mistress
task
quite
like
mine
and
you
should
have
heard
aunt
polly
dire
predictions
of
what
summer
boarders
would
be
she
chuckled
irrepressibly
what
was
that
pollyanna
shook
her
head
decidedly
could
possibly
tell
you
that
a
dead
secret
but
she
stopped
and
sighed
her
face
growing
wistful
again
this
is
going
to
last
you
know
it
ca
summer
boarders
do
i
got
to
do
something
winters
i
been
thinking
i
believe
i
write
stories
jamie
turned
with
a
start
you
what
he
demanded
write
stories
to
sell
you
know
you
need
look
so
surprised
lots
of
folks
do
that
i
knew
two
girls
in
germany
who
did
did
you
ever
try
it
jamie
still
spoke
a
little
queerly
not
yet
admitted
pollyanna
then
defensively
in
answer
to
the
expression
on
his
face
she
bridled
i
told
you
i
was
keeping
summer
boarders
now
i
ca
do
both
at
once
of
course
not
she
threw
him
a
reproachful
glance
you
do
think
i
can
ever
do
it
i
did
say
so
no
but
you
look
it
i
do
see
why
i
ca
it
is
like
singing
you
do
have
to
have
a
voice
for
it
and
it
is
like
an
instrument
that
you
have
to
learn
how
to
play
i
think
it
is
a
little
like
that
jamie
voice
was
low
his
eyes
were
turned
away
how
what
do
you
mean
why
jamie
just
a
pencil
and
paper
so
that
is
like
learning
to
play
the
piano
or
violin
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
came
the
answer
still
in
that
low
diffident
voice
still
with
the
eyes
turned
away
the
instrument
that
you
play
on
pollyanna
will
be
the
great
heart
of
the
world
and
to
me
that
seems
the
most
wonderful
instrument
of
all
to
learn
under
your
touch
if
you
are
skilful
it
will
respond
with
smiles
or
tears
as
you
will
illustration
instrument
that
you
play
on
pollyanna
will
be
the
great
heart
of
the
world
pollyanna
drew
a
tremulous
sigh
her
eyes
grew
wet
oh
jamie
how
beautifully
you
do
put
things
always
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way
but
it
so
is
it
how
i
would
love
to
do
it
maybe
i
could
do
all
that
but
i
read
stories
in
the
magazines
lots
of
them
seems
as
if
i
could
write
some
like
those
anyway
i
love
to
tell
stories
i
always
repeating
those
you
tell
and
i
always
laugh
and
cry
too
just
as
i
do
when
you
tell
them
jamie
turned
quickly
do
they
make
you
laugh
and
cry
pollyanna
really
there
was
a
curious
eagerness
in
his
voice
of
course
they
do
and
you
know
it
jamie
and
they
used
to
long
ago
too
in
the
public
garden
nobody
can
tell
stories
like
you
jamie
you
ought
to
be
the
one
writing
stories
not
i
and
say
jamie
why
do
you
you
could
do
it
lovely
i
know
there
was
no
answer
jamie
apparently
did
not
hear
perhaps
because
he
called
at
that
instant
to
a
chipmunk
that
was
scurrying
through
the
bushes
near
by
it
was
not
always
with
jamie
nor
yet
with
carew
and
sadie
dean
that
pollyanna
had
delightful
walks
and
talks
however
very
often
it
was
with
jimmy
or
john
pendleton
pollyanna
was
sure
now
that
she
had
never
before
known
john
pendleton
the
old
taciturn
moroseness
seemed
entirely
gone
since
they
came
to
camp
he
rowed
and
swam
and
fished
and
tramped
with
fully
as
much
enthusiasm
as
did
jimmy
himself
and
with
almost
as
much
vigor
around
the
camp
fire
at
night
he
quite
rivaled
jamie
with
his
of
adventures
both
laughable
and
thrilling
that
had
befallen
him
in
his
foreign
travels
in
the
of
sarah
nancy
used
to
call
it
laughed
pollyanna
one
night
as
she
joined
the
rest
in
begging
for
a
story
better
than
all
this
however
in
pollyanna
opinion
were
the
times
when
john
pendleton
with
her
alone
talked
of
her
mother
as
he
used
to
know
her
and
love
her
in
the
days
long
gone
that
he
did
so
talk
with
her
was
a
joy
to
pollyanna
but
a
great
surprise
too
for
never
in
the
past
had
john
pendleton
talked
so
freely
of
the
girl
whom
he
had
so
loved
hopelessly
perhaps
john
pendleton
himself
felt
some
of
the
surprise
for
once
he
said
to
pollyanna
musingly
i
wonder
why
i
talking
to
you
like
this
oh
but
i
love
to
have
you
breathed
pollyanna
yes
i
know
but
i
would
think
i
would
do
it
it
must
be
though
that
it
because
you
are
so
like
her
as
i
knew
her
you
are
very
like
your
mother
my
dear
why
i
thought
my
mother
was
beautiful
cried
pollyanna
in
unconcealed
amazement
john
pendleton
smiled
quizzically
she
was
my
dear
pollyanna
looked
still
more
amazed
then
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
like
her
the
man
laughed
outright
pollyanna
if
some
girls
had
said
that
i
well
never
mind
what
say
you
little
witch
you
poor
homely
little
pollyanna
pollyanna
flashed
a
genuinely
distressed
reproof
straight
into
the
man
merry
eyes
please
pendleton
do
look
like
that
and
do
tease
me
about
that
i
so
love
to
be
beautiful
though
of
course
it
sounds
silly
to
say
it
and
i
have
a
mirror
you
know
then
i
advise
you
to
look
in
it
when
you
talking
sometime
observed
the
man
sententiously
pollyanna
eyes
flew
wide
open
why
that
just
what
jimmy
said
she
cried
did
he
indeed
the
young
rascal
retorted
john
pendleton
dryly
then
with
one
of
the
curiously
abrupt
changes
of
manner
peculiar
to
him
he
said
very
low
you
have
your
mother
eyes
and
smile
pollyanna
and
to
me
you
are
beautiful
and
pollyanna
her
eyes
blinded
with
sudden
hot
tears
was
silenced
dear
as
were
these
talks
however
they
still
were
not
quite
like
the
talks
with
jimmy
to
pollyanna
for
that
matter
she
and
jimmy
did
not
need
to
talk
to
be
happy
jimmy
was
always
so
comfortable
and
comforting
whether
they
talked
or
not
did
not
matter
jimmy
always
understood
there
was
no
pulling
on
her
for
sympathy
with
jimmy
jimmy
was
delightfully
big
and
strong
and
happy
jimmy
was
not
sorrowing
for
a
nephew
nor
pining
for
the
loss
of
a
boyhood
sweetheart
jimmy
did
not
have
to
swing
himself
painfully
about
on
a
pair
of
crutches
all
of
which
was
so
hard
to
see
and
know
and
think
of
with
jimmy
one
could
be
just
glad
and
happy
and
free
jimmy
was
such
a
dear
he
always
rested
one
so
did
jimmy
chapter
xxiii
tied
to
two
sticks
it
was
on
the
last
day
at
camp
that
it
happened
to
pollyanna
it
seemed
such
a
pity
that
it
should
have
happened
at
all
for
it
was
the
first
cloud
to
bring
a
shadow
of
regret
and
unhappiness
to
her
heart
during
the
whole
trip
and
she
found
herself
futilely
sighing
i
wish
we
gone
home
day
before
yesterday
then
it
would
have
happened
but
they
had
not
gone
home
day
before
yesterday
and
it
had
happened
and
this
was
the
manner
of
it
early
in
the
morning
of
that
last
day
they
had
all
started
on
a
tramp
to
the
basin
we
have
one
more
fish
dinner
before
we
go
jimmy
had
said
and
the
rest
had
joyfully
agreed
with
luncheon
and
fishing
tackle
therefore
they
had
made
an
early
start
laughing
and
calling
gaily
to
each
other
they
followed
the
narrow
path
through
the
woods
led
by
jimmy
who
best
knew
the
way
at
first
close
behind
jimmy
had
walked
pollyanna
but
gradually
she
had
fallen
back
with
jamie
who
was
last
in
the
line
pollyanna
had
thought
she
detected
on
jamie
face
the
expression
which
she
had
come
to
know
was
there
only
when
he
was
attempting
something
that
taxed
almost
to
the
his
skill
and
powers
of
endurance
she
knew
that
nothing
would
so
offend
him
as
to
have
her
openly
notice
this
state
of
affairs
at
the
same
time
she
also
knew
that
from
her
more
willingly
than
from
any
one
else
would
he
accept
an
occasional
steadying
hand
over
a
troublesome
log
or
stone
therefore
at
the
first
opportunity
to
make
the
change
without
apparent
design
she
had
dropped
back
step
by
step
until
she
had
reached
her
goal
jamie
she
had
been
rewarded
instantly
in
the
way
jamie
face
brightened
and
in
the
easy
assurance
with
which
he
met
and
conquered
a
fallen
across
their
path
under
the
pleasant
fiction
carefully
fostered
by
pollyanna
of
helping
her
across
once
out
of
the
woods
their
way
led
along
an
old
stone
wall
for
a
time
with
wide
reaches
of
sunny
sloping
pastures
on
each
side
and
a
more
distant
picturesque
farmhouse
it
was
in
the
adjoining
pasture
that
pollyanna
saw
the
goldenrod
which
she
immediately
coveted
jamie
wait
i
going
to
get
it
she
exclaimed
eagerly
it
make
such
a
beautiful
bouquet
for
our
picnic
table
and
nimbly
she
scrambled
over
the
high
stone
wall
and
dropped
herself
down
on
the
other
side
it
was
strange
how
tantalizing
was
that
goldenrod
always
just
ahead
she
saw
another
bunch
and
yet
another
each
a
little
finer
than
the
one
within
her
reach
with
joyous
exclamations
and
gay
little
calls
back
to
the
waiting
jamie
pollyanna
looking
particularly
attractive
in
her
scarlet
sweater
skipped
from
bunch
to
bunch
adding
to
her
store
she
had
both
hands
full
when
there
came
the
hideous
bellow
of
an
angry
bull
the
agonized
shout
from
jamie
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
thundering
down
the
hillside
what
happened
next
was
never
clear
to
her
she
knew
she
dropped
her
goldenrod
and
ran
ran
as
she
never
ran
before
ran
as
she
thought
she
never
could
run
back
toward
the
wall
and
jamie
she
knew
that
behind
her
the
were
gaining
gaining
always
gaining
dimly
hopelessly
far
ahead
of
her
she
saw
jamie
agonized
face
and
heard
his
hoarse
cries
then
from
somewhere
came
a
new
voice
jimmy
shouting
a
cheery
call
of
courage
still
on
and
on
she
ran
blindly
hearing
nearer
and
nearer
the
thud
of
those
pounding
hoofs
once
she
stumbled
and
almost
fell
then
dizzily
she
righted
herself
and
plunged
forward
she
felt
her
strength
quite
gone
when
suddenly
close
to
her
she
heard
jimmy
cheery
call
again
the
next
minute
she
felt
herself
snatched
off
her
feet
and
held
close
to
a
great
throbbing
something
that
dimly
she
realized
was
heart
it
was
all
a
horrid
blur
then
of
cries
hot
panting
breaths
and
pounding
hoofs
thundering
nearer
ever
nearer
then
just
as
she
knew
those
hoofs
to
be
almost
upon
her
she
felt
herself
flung
still
in
jimmy
arms
sharply
to
one
side
and
yet
not
so
far
but
that
she
still
could
feel
the
hot
breath
of
the
maddened
animal
as
he
dashed
by
almost
at
once
then
she
found
herself
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
with
jimmy
bending
over
her
imploring
her
to
tell
him
she
was
not
dead
with
an
hysterical
laugh
that
was
yet
half
a
sob
she
struggled
out
of
his
arms
and
stood
upon
her
feet
dead
no
indeed
thanks
to
you
jimmy
i
all
right
i
all
right
oh
how
glad
glad
glad
i
was
to
hear
your
voice
oh
that
was
splendid
how
did
you
do
it
she
panted
pooh
that
was
nothing
i
just
an
inarticulate
choking
cry
brought
his
words
to
a
sudden
halt
he
turned
to
find
jamie
face
down
on
the
ground
a
little
distance
away
pollyanna
was
already
hurrying
toward
him
jamie
jamie
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
did
you
fall
are
you
hurt
there
was
no
answer
what
is
it
old
fellow
are
you
hurt
demanded
jimmy
still
there
was
no
answer
then
suddenly
jamie
pulled
himself
half
upright
and
turned
they
saw
his
face
then
and
fell
back
shocked
and
amazed
hurt
am
i
hurt
he
choked
huskily
flinging
out
both
his
hands
do
you
suppose
it
hurts
to
see
a
thing
like
that
and
not
be
able
to
do
anything
to
be
tied
helpless
to
a
pair
of
sticks
i
tell
you
there
no
hurt
in
all
the
world
to
equal
it
but
but
jamie
faltered
pollyanna
do
interrupted
the
cripple
almost
harshly
he
had
struggled
to
his
feet
now
do
say
anything
i
did
mean
to
make
a
scene
like
this
he
finished
brokenly
as
he
turned
and
swung
back
along
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
the
camp
for
a
minute
as
if
transfixed
the
two
behind
him
watched
him
go
well
by
jove
breathed
jimmy
then
in
a
voice
that
shook
a
little
that
was
tough
on
him
and
i
did
think
and
praised
you
right
before
him
pollyanna
and
his
hands
did
you
see
them
they
were
bleeding
where
the
nails
had
cut
right
into
the
flesh
she
finished
as
she
turned
and
stumbled
blindly
up
the
path
but
pollyanna
are
you
going
cried
jimmy
i
going
to
jamie
of
course
do
you
think
i
leave
him
like
that
come
we
must
get
him
to
come
back
and
jimmy
with
a
sigh
that
was
not
all
for
jamie
went
chapter
xxiv
jimmy
wakes
up
outwardly
the
camping
trip
was
pronounced
a
great
success
but
inwardly
pollyanna
wondered
sometimes
if
it
were
all
herself
or
if
there
really
were
a
peculiar
indefinable
constraint
in
everybody
with
everybody
else
certainly
she
felt
it
and
she
thought
she
saw
evidences
that
the
others
felt
it
too
as
for
the
cause
of
it
all
unhesitatingly
she
attributed
it
to
that
last
day
at
camp
with
its
unfortunate
trip
to
the
basin
to
be
sure
she
and
jimmy
had
easily
caught
up
with
jamie
and
had
after
considerable
coaxing
persuaded
him
to
turn
about
and
go
on
to
the
basin
with
them
but
in
spite
of
everybody
very
evident
efforts
to
act
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
happened
nobody
really
succeeded
in
doing
so
pollyanna
jamie
and
jimmy
overdid
their
gayety
a
bit
perhaps
and
the
others
while
not
knowing
exactly
what
had
happened
very
evidently
felt
that
something
was
not
quite
right
though
they
plainly
tried
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
did
feel
so
naturally
in
this
state
of
affairs
restful
happiness
was
out
of
the
question
even
the
anticipated
fish
dinner
was
flavorless
and
early
in
the
afternoon
the
start
was
made
back
to
the
camp
once
home
again
pollyanna
had
hoped
that
the
unhappy
episode
of
the
angry
bull
would
be
forgotten
but
she
could
not
forget
it
so
in
all
fairness
she
could
not
blame
the
others
if
they
could
not
always
she
thought
of
it
now
when
she
looked
at
jamie
she
saw
again
the
agony
on
his
face
the
crimson
stain
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
her
heart
ached
for
him
and
because
it
did
so
ache
his
mere
presence
had
come
to
be
a
pain
to
her
remorsefully
she
confessed
to
herself
that
she
did
not
like
to
be
with
jamie
now
nor
to
talk
with
him
but
that
did
not
mean
that
she
was
not
often
with
him
she
was
with
him
indeed
much
oftener
than
before
for
so
remorseful
was
she
and
so
fearful
was
she
that
he
would
detect
her
unhappy
frame
of
mind
that
she
lost
no
opportunity
of
responding
to
his
overtures
of
comradeship
and
sometimes
she
deliberately
sought
him
out
this
last
she
did
not
often
have
to
do
however
for
more
and
more
frequently
these
days
jamie
seemed
to
be
turning
to
her
for
companionship
the
reason
for
this
pollyanna
believed
was
to
be
found
in
this
same
incident
of
the
bull
and
the
rescue
not
that
jamie
ever
referred
to
it
directly
he
never
did
that
he
was
too
even
gayer
than
usual
but
pollyanna
thought
she
detected
sometimes
a
bitterness
underneath
it
all
that
was
never
there
before
certainly
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
at
times
he
seemed
almost
to
want
to
avoid
the
others
and
that
he
actually
sighed
as
if
with
relief
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
she
thought
she
knew
why
this
was
so
after
he
said
to
her
as
he
did
say
one
day
while
they
were
watching
the
others
play
tennis
you
see
after
all
pollyanna
there
is
any
one
who
can
quite
understand
as
you
can
pollyanna
had
not
known
what
he
meant
at
first
they
had
been
watching
the
players
for
five
minutes
without
a
word
between
them
yes
for
you
once
could
walk
yourself
yes
i
know
faltered
pollyanna
and
she
knew
that
her
great
distress
must
have
shown
in
her
face
for
so
quickly
and
so
blithely
did
he
change
the
subject
after
a
laughing
come
come
pollyanna
why
do
you
tell
me
to
play
the
game
i
would
if
i
were
in
your
place
forget
it
please
i
was
a
brute
to
make
you
look
like
that
and
pollyanna
smiled
and
said
no
no
no
indeed
but
she
did
not
forget
it
she
could
not
and
it
all
made
her
only
the
more
anxious
to
be
with
jamie
and
help
him
all
she
could
as
if
now
i
ever
let
him
see
that
i
was
ever
anything
but
glad
when
he
was
with
me
she
thought
fervently
as
she
hurried
forward
a
minute
later
to
take
her
turn
in
the
game
pollyanna
however
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
party
who
felt
a
new
awkwardness
and
constraint
jimmy
pendleton
felt
it
though
he
too
tried
not
to
show
it
jimmy
was
not
happy
these
days
from
a
youth
whose
visions
were
of
wonderful
spans
across
hitherto
unbridgeable
chasms
he
has
come
to
be
an
young
man
whose
visions
were
of
a
feared
rival
bearing
away
the
girl
he
loved
jimmy
knew
very
well
now
that
he
was
in
love
with
pollyanna
he
suspected
that
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
for
some
time
he
stood
aghast
indeed
to
find
himself
so
shaken
and
powerless
before
this
thing
that
had
come
to
him
he
knew
that
even
his
beloved
bridges
were
as
nothing
when
weighed
against
the
smile
in
a
girl
eyes
and
the
word
on
a
girl
lips
he
realized
that
the
most
wonderful
span
in
the
world
to
him
would
be
the
thing
that
could
help
him
to
cross
the
chasm
of
fear
and
doubt
that
he
felt
lay
between
him
and
pollyanna
doubt
because
of
pollyanna
fear
because
of
jamie
not
until
he
had
seen
pollyanna
in
jeopardy
that
day
in
the
pasture
had
he
realized
how
empty
would
be
the
world
his
world
without
her
not
until
his
wild
dash
for
safety
with
pollyanna
in
his
arms
had
he
realized
how
precious
she
was
to
him
for
a
moment
indeed
with
his
arms
about
her
and
hers
clinging
about
his
neck
he
had
felt
that
she
was
indeed
his
and
even
in
that
supreme
moment
of
danger
he
knew
the
thrill
of
supreme
bliss
then
a
little
later
he
had
seen
face
and
jamie
hands
to
him
they
could
mean
but
one
thing
jamie
too
loved
pollyanna
and
jamie
had
to
stand
by
helpless
tied
to
two
sticks
that
was
what
he
had
said
jimmy
believed
that
had
he
himself
been
obliged
to
stand
by
helpless
tied
to
two
sticks
while
another
rescued
the
girl
that
he
loved
he
would
have
looked
like
that
jimmy
had
gone
back
to
camp
that
day
with
his
thoughts
in
a
turmoil
of
fear
and
rebellion
he
wondered
if
pollyanna
cared
for
jamie
that
was
where
the
fear
came
in
but
even
if
she
did
care
a
little
must
he
stand
aside
weakly
and
let
jamie
without
a
struggle
make
her
learn
to
care
more
that
was
where
the
rebellion
came
in
indeed
no
he
would
not
do
it
decided
jimmy
it
should
be
a
fair
fight
between
them
then
all
by
himself
as
he
was
jimmy
flushed
hot
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
would
it
be
a
fair
fight
could
any
fight
between
him
and
jamie
be
a
fair
fight
jimmy
felt
suddenly
as
he
had
felt
years
before
when
as
a
lad
he
had
challenged
a
new
boy
to
a
fight
for
an
apple
they
both
claimed
then
at
the
first
blow
had
discovered
that
the
new
boy
had
a
crippled
arm
he
had
purposely
lost
then
of
course
and
had
let
the
crippled
boy
win
but
he
told
himself
fiercely
now
that
this
case
was
different
it
was
no
apple
that
was
at
stake
it
was
his
life
happiness
it
might
even
be
pollyanna
happiness
too
perhaps
she
did
not
care
for
jamie
at
all
but
would
care
for
her
old
friend
jimmy
if
he
but
once
showed
her
he
wanted
her
to
care
and
he
would
show
her
he
would
once
again
jimmy
blushed
hotly
but
he
frowned
too
angrily
if
only
he
could
forget
how
jamie
had
looked
when
he
had
uttered
that
moaning
tied
to
two
sticks
if
only
but
what
was
the
use
it
was
not
a
fair
fight
and
he
knew
it
he
knew
too
right
there
and
then
that
his
decision
would
be
just
what
it
afterwards
proved
to
be
he
would
watch
and
wait
he
would
give
jamie
his
chance
and
if
pollyanna
showed
that
she
cared
he
would
take
himself
off
and
away
quite
out
of
their
lives
and
they
should
never
know
either
of
them
how
bitterly
he
was
suffering
he
would
go
back
to
his
bridges
as
if
any
bridge
though
it
led
to
the
moon
itself
could
compare
for
a
moment
with
pollyanna
but
he
would
do
it
he
must
do
it
it
was
all
very
fine
and
heroic
and
jimmy
felt
so
exalted
he
was
atingle
with
something
that
was
almost
happiness
when
he
finally
dropped
off
to
sleep
that
night
but
martyrdom
in
theory
and
practice
differs
woefully
as
martyrs
have
found
out
from
time
immemorial
it
was
all
very
well
to
decide
alone
and
in
the
dark
that
he
would
give
jamie
his
chance
but
it
was
quite
another
matter
really
to
do
it
when
it
involved
nothing
less
than
the
leaving
of
pollyanna
and
jamie
together
almost
every
time
he
saw
them
then
too
he
was
very
much
worried
at
pollyanna
apparent
attitude
toward
the
lame
youth
it
looked
very
much
to
jimmy
as
if
she
did
indeed
care
for
him
so
watchful
was
she
of
his
comfort
so
apparently
eager
to
be
with
him
then
as
if
to
settle
any
possible
doubt
in
jimmy
mind
there
came
the
day
when
sadie
dean
had
something
to
say
on
the
subject
they
were
all
out
in
the
tennis
court
sadie
was
sitting
alone
when
jimmy
strolled
up
to
her
you
next
with
pollyanna
is
it
he
queried
she
shook
her
head
pollyanna
is
playing
any
more
this
morning
is
playing
frowned
jimmy
who
had
been
counting
on
his
own
game
with
pollyanna
why
not
for
a
brief
minute
sadie
dean
did
not
answer
then
with
very
evident
difficulty
she
said
pollyanna
told
me
last
night
that
she
thought
we
were
playing
tennis
too
much
that
it
was
kind
to
carew
as
long
as
he
play
i
know
but
jimmy
stopped
helplessly
the
frown
plowing
a
deeper
furrow
into
his
forehead
the
next
instant
he
fairly
started
with
surprise
at
the
tense
something
in
sadie
dean
voice
as
she
said
but
he
does
want
her
to
stop
he
does
want
any
one
of
us
to
make
any
difference
for
him
it
that
that
hurts
him
so
she
understand
she
does
understand
but
i
do
she
thinks
she
does
though
something
in
words
or
manner
sent
a
sudden
pang
to
jimmy
heart
he
threw
a
sharp
look
into
her
face
a
question
flew
to
his
lips
for
a
moment
he
held
it
back
then
trying
to
hide
his
earnestness
with
a
bantering
smile
he
let
it
come
why
miss
dean
you
do
mean
to
convey
the
idea
that
that
any
special
interest
in
each
other
between
those
two
do
you
she
gave
him
a
scornful
glance
where
have
your
eyes
been
she
worships
him
i
mean
they
worship
each
other
she
corrected
hastily
jimmy
with
an
inarticulate
ejaculation
turned
and
walked
away
abruptly
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
remain
longer
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
any
more
just
then
to
sadie
dean
so
abruptly
indeed
did
he
turn
that
he
did
not
notice
that
sadie
dean
too
turned
hurriedly
and
busied
herself
looking
in
the
grass
at
her
feet
as
if
she
had
lost
something
very
evidently
sadie
dean
also
did
not
wish
to
talk
any
more
just
then
jimmy
pendleton
told
himself
that
it
was
not
true
at
all
that
it
was
all
falderal
what
sadie
dean
had
said
yet
nevertheless
true
or
not
true
he
could
not
forget
it
it
colored
all
his
thoughts
thereafter
and
loomed
before
his
eyes
like
a
shadow
whenever
he
saw
pollyanna
and
jamie
together
he
watched
their
faces
covertly
he
listened
to
the
tones
of
their
voices
he
came
then
in
time
to
think
it
was
after
all
true
that
they
did
worship
each
other
and
his
heart
in
consequence
grew
like
lead
within
him
true
to
his
promise
to
himself
however
he
turned
resolutely
away
the
die
was
cast
he
told
himself
pollyanna
was
not
to
be
for
him
restless
days
for
jimmy
followed
to
stay
away
from
the
harrington
homestead
entirely
he
did
not
dare
lest
his
secret
be
suspected
to
be
with
pollyanna
at
all
now
was
torture
even
to
be
with
sadie
dean
was
unpleasant
for
he
could
not
forget
that
it
was
sadie
dean
who
had
finally
opened
his
eyes
jamie
certainly
was
no
haven
of
refuge
under
the
circumstances
and
that
left
only
carew
carew
however
was
a
host
in
herself
and
jimmy
found
his
only
comfort
these
days
in
her
society
gay
or
grave
she
always
seemed
to
know
how
to
fit
his
mood
exactly
and
it
was
wonderful
how
much
she
knew
about
bridges
the
kind
of
bridges
he
was
going
to
build
she
was
so
wise
too
and
so
sympathetic
knowing
always
just
the
right
word
to
say
he
even
one
day
almost
told
her
about
the
packet
but
john
pendleton
interrupted
them
at
just
the
wrong
moment
so
the
story
was
not
told
john
pendleton
was
always
interrupting
them
at
just
the
wrong
moment
jimmy
thought
vexedly
sometimes
then
when
he
remembered
what
john
pendleton
had
done
for
him
he
was
ashamed
the
packet
was
a
thing
that
dated
back
to
jimmy
boyhood
and
had
never
been
mentioned
to
any
one
save
to
john
pendleton
and
that
only
once
at
the
time
of
his
adoption
the
packet
was
nothing
but
rather
a
large
white
envelope
worn
with
time
and
plump
with
mystery
behind
a
huge
red
seal
it
had
been
given
him
by
his
father
and
it
bore
the
following
instructions
in
his
father
hand
to
my
boy
jimmy
not
to
be
opened
until
his
thirtieth
birthday
except
in
case
of
his
death
when
it
shall
be
opened
at
once
there
were
times
when
jimmy
speculated
a
good
deal
as
to
the
contents
of
that
envelope
there
were
other
times
when
he
forgot
its
existence
in
the
old
days
at
the
orphans
home
his
chief
terror
had
been
that
it
should
be
discovered
and
taken
away
from
him
in
those
days
he
wore
it
always
hidden
in
the
lining
of
his
coat
of
late
years
at
john
pendleton
suggestion
it
had
been
tucked
away
in
the
pendleton
safe
for
there
no
knowing
how
valuable
it
may
be
john
pendleton
had
said
with
a
smile
and
anyway
your
father
evidently
wanted
you
to
have
it
and
we
would
want
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
it
no
i
would
want
to
lose
it
of
course
jimmy
had
smiled
back
a
little
soberly
but
i
not
counting
on
its
being
real
valuable
sir
poor
dad
did
have
anything
that
was
very
valuable
about
him
as
i
remember
it
was
this
packet
that
jimmy
came
so
near
mentioning
to
carew
one
day
if
only
john
pendleton
had
not
interrupted
them
still
maybe
it
just
as
well
i
did
tell
her
about
it
jimmy
reflected
afterwards
on
his
way
home
she
might
have
thought
dad
had
something
in
his
life
that
was
quite
right
and
i
would
have
wanted
her
to
think
that
of
dad
chapter
xxv
the
game
and
pollyanna
before
the
middle
of
september
the
carews
and
sadie
dean
said
and
went
back
to
boston
much
as
she
knew
she
would
miss
them
pollyanna
drew
an
actual
sigh
of
relief
as
the
train
bearing
them
away
rolled
out
of
the
beldingsville
station
pollyanna
would
not
have
admitted
having
this
feeling
of
relief
to
any
one
else
and
even
to
herself
she
apologized
in
her
thoughts
it
is
that
i
do
love
them
dearly
every
one
of
them
she
sighed
watching
the
train
disappear
around
the
curve
far
down
the
track
it
only
that
that
i
so
sorry
for
poor
jamie
all
the
time
and
and
i
am
tired
i
shall
be
glad
for
a
while
just
to
go
back
to
the
old
quiet
days
with
jimmy
pollyanna
however
did
not
go
back
to
the
old
quiet
days
with
jimmy
the
days
that
immediately
followed
the
going
of
the
carews
were
quiet
certainly
but
they
were
not
passed
with
jimmy
jimmy
rarely
came
near
the
house
now
and
when
he
did
call
he
was
not
the
old
jimmy
that
she
used
to
know
he
was
moody
restless
and
silent
or
else
very
gay
and
talkative
in
a
nervous
fashion
that
was
most
puzzling
and
annoying
before
long
too
he
himself
went
to
boston
and
then
of
course
she
did
not
see
him
at
all
pollyanna
was
surprised
then
to
see
how
much
she
missed
him
even
to
know
that
he
was
in
town
and
that
there
was
a
chance
that
he
might
come
over
was
better
than
the
dreary
emptiness
of
certain
absence
and
even
his
puzzling
moods
of
alternating
gloominess
and
gayety
were
preferable
to
this
utter
silence
of
nothingness
then
one
day
suddenly
she
pulled
herself
up
with
hot
cheeks
and
shamed
eyes
well
pollyanna
whittier
she
upbraided
herself
sharply
one
would
think
you
were
in
love
with
jimmy
bean
pendleton
ca
you
think
of
anything
but
him
whereupon
forthwith
she
bestirred
herself
to
be
very
gay
and
lively
indeed
and
to
put
this
jimmy
bean
pendleton
out
of
her
thoughts
as
it
happened
aunt
polly
though
unwittingly
helped
her
to
this
with
the
going
of
the
carews
had
gone
also
their
chief
source
of
immediate
income
and
aunt
polly
was
beginning
to
worry
again
audibly
about
the
state
of
their
finances
i
do
know
really
pollyanna
what
is
going
to
become
of
us
she
would
moan
frequently
of
course
we
are
a
little
ahead
now
from
this
summer
work
and
we
have
a
small
sum
from
the
estate
right
along
but
i
never
know
how
soon
that
going
to
stop
like
all
the
rest
if
only
we
could
do
something
to
bring
in
some
ready
cash
it
was
after
one
of
these
moaning
lamentations
one
day
that
pollyanna
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
a
contest
offer
it
was
a
most
alluring
one
the
prizes
were
large
and
numerous
the
conditions
were
set
forth
in
glowing
terms
to
read
it
one
would
think
that
to
win
out
were
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
it
contained
even
a
special
appeal
that
might
have
been
framed
for
pollyanna
herself
this
is
for
you
you
who
read
this
it
ran
what
if
you
never
have
written
a
story
before
that
is
no
sign
you
can
not
write
one
try
it
that
all
would
you
like
three
thousand
dollars
two
thousand
one
thousand
five
hundred
or
even
one
hundred
then
why
not
go
after
it
the
very
thing
cried
pollyanna
clapping
her
hands
i
so
glad
i
saw
it
and
it
says
i
can
do
it
too
i
thought
i
could
if
i
just
try
i
go
tell
auntie
so
she
need
worry
any
more
pollyanna
was
on
her
feet
and
half
way
to
the
door
when
a
second
thought
brought
her
steps
to
a
pause
come
to
think
of
it
i
reckon
i
wo
after
all
it
be
all
the
nicer
to
surprise
her
and
if
i
should
get
the
first
one
pollyanna
went
to
sleep
that
night
planning
what
she
could
do
with
that
three
thousand
dollars
pollyanna
began
her
story
the
next
day
that
is
she
with
a
very
important
air
got
out
a
quantity
of
paper
sharpened
up
pencils
and
established
herself
at
the
big
harrington
desk
in
the
after
biting
restlessly
at
the
ends
of
two
of
her
pencils
she
wrote
down
three
words
on
the
fair
white
page
before
her
then
she
drew
a
long
sigh
threw
aside
the
second
ruined
pencil
and
picked
up
a
slender
green
one
with
a
beautiful
point
this
point
she
eyed
with
a
meditative
frown
o
dear
i
wonder
where
they
get
their
titles
she
despaired
maybe
though
i
ought
to
decide
on
the
story
first
and
then
make
a
title
to
fit
anyhow
i
going
to
do
it
and
forthwith
she
drew
a
black
line
through
the
three
words
and
poised
the
pencil
for
a
fresh
start
the
start
was
not
made
at
once
however
even
when
it
was
made
it
must
have
been
a
false
one
for
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
whole
page
was
nothing
but
a
jumble
of
lines
with
only
a
few
words
here
and
there
left
to
tell
the
tale
at
this
juncture
aunt
polly
came
into
the
room
she
turned
tired
eyes
upon
her
niece
well
pollyanna
what
are
you
up
to
now
she
demanded
pollyanna
laughed
and
colored
guiltily
nothing
much
auntie
anyhow
it
does
look
as
if
it
were
much
yet
she
admitted
with
a
rueful
smile
besides
it
a
secret
and
i
not
going
to
tell
it
yet
very
well
suit
yourself
sighed
aunt
polly
but
i
can
tell
you
right
now
that
if
you
trying
to
make
anything
different
out
of
those
mortgage
papers
hart
left
it
useless
i
been
all
over
them
myself
twice
no
dear
it
is
the
papers
it
a
whole
heap
nicer
than
any
papers
ever
could
be
crowed
pollyanna
triumphantly
turning
back
to
her
work
in
pollyanna
eyes
suddenly
had
risen
a
glowing
vision
of
what
it
might
be
with
that
three
thousand
dollars
once
hers
for
still
another
pollyanna
wrote
and
scratched
and
chewed
her
pencils
then
with
her
courage
dulled
but
not
destroyed
she
gathered
up
her
papers
and
pencils
and
left
the
room
i
reckon
maybe
i
do
better
by
myself
she
was
thinking
as
she
hurried
through
the
hall
i
thought
i
ought
to
do
it
at
a
desk
being
literary
work
so
but
anyhow
the
desk
did
help
me
any
this
morning
i
try
the
window
seat
in
my
room
the
window
seat
however
proved
to
be
no
more
inspiring
judging
by
the
scratched
and
pages
that
fell
from
pollyanna
hands
and
at
the
end
of
another
pollyanna
discovered
suddenly
that
it
was
time
to
get
dinner
well
i
glad
is
anyhow
she
sighed
to
herself
i
a
lot
rather
get
dinner
than
do
this
not
but
that
i
want
to
do
this
of
course
only
i
no
idea
was
such
an
awful
job
just
a
story
so
during
the
following
month
pollyanna
worked
faithfully
doggedly
but
she
soon
found
that
just
a
story
so
was
indeed
no
small
matter
to
accomplish
pollyanna
however
was
not
one
to
set
her
hand
to
the
plow
and
look
back
besides
there
was
that
prize
or
even
any
of
the
others
if
she
should
not
happen
to
win
the
first
one
of
course
even
one
hundred
dollars
was
something
so
day
after
day
she
wrote
and
erased
and
rewrote
until
finally
the
story
such
as
it
was
lay
completed
before
her
then
with
some
misgivings
it
must
be
confessed
she
took
the
manuscript
to
milly
snow
to
be
typewritten
it
reads
all
right
that
is
it
makes
sense
mused
pollyanna
doubtfully
as
she
hurried
along
toward
the
snow
cottage
and
it
a
real
nice
story
about
a
perfectly
lovely
girl
but
there
something
somewhere
that
is
quite
right
about
it
i
afraid
anyhow
i
believe
i
better
count
too
much
on
the
first
prize
then
i
wo
be
too
much
disappointed
when
i
get
one
of
the
littler
ones
pollyanna
always
thought
of
jimmy
when
she
went
to
the
snows
for
it
was
at
the
side
of
the
road
near
their
cottage
that
she
had
first
seen
him
as
a
forlorn
little
runaway
lad
from
the
orphans
home
years
before
she
thought
of
him
again
with
a
little
catch
of
her
breath
then
with
the
proud
lifting
of
her
head
that
always
came
now
with
the
second
thought
of
jimmy
she
hurried
up
the
snows
doorsteps
and
rang
the
bell
as
was
usually
the
case
the
snows
had
nothing
but
the
warmest
of
welcomes
for
pollyanna
and
also
as
usual
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
talking
of
the
game
in
no
home
in
beldingsville
was
the
glad
game
more
ardently
played
than
in
the
snows
well
and
how
are
you
getting
along
asked
pollyanna
when
she
had
finished
the
business
part
of
her
call
splendidly
beamed
milly
snow
this
is
the
third
job
i
got
this
week
oh
miss
pollyanna
i
so
glad
you
had
me
take
up
typewriting
for
you
see
i
can
do
that
right
at
home
and
it
all
owing
to
you
nonsense
disclaimed
pollyanna
merrily
but
it
is
in
the
first
place
i
could
have
done
it
anyway
if
it
had
been
for
the
game
making
mother
so
much
better
you
know
that
i
had
some
time
to
myself
and
then
at
the
very
first
you
suggested
typewriting
and
helped
me
to
buy
a
machine
i
should
like
to
know
if
that
does
come
pretty
near
owing
it
all
to
you
but
once
again
pollyanna
objected
this
time
she
was
interrupted
by
mrs
snow
from
her
wheel
chair
by
the
window
and
so
earnestly
and
gravely
did
mrs
snow
speak
that
pollyanna
in
spite
of
herself
could
but
hear
what
she
had
to
say
listen
child
i
do
think
you
know
quite
what
you
done
but
i
wish
you
could
there
a
little
look
in
your
eyes
my
dear
that
i
do
like
to
see
there
you
are
plagued
and
worried
over
something
i
know
i
can
see
it
and
i
do
wonder
your
death
your
aunt
condition
everything
i
wo
say
more
about
that
but
there
something
i
do
want
to
say
my
dear
and
you
must
let
me
say
it
for
i
ca
bear
to
see
that
shadow
in
your
eyes
without
trying
to
drive
it
away
by
telling
you
what
you
done
for
me
for
this
whole
town
and
for
countless
other
people
everywhere
mrs
snow
protested
pollyanna
in
genuine
distress
oh
i
mean
it
and
i
know
what
i
talking
about
nodded
the
invalid
triumphantly
to
begin
with
look
at
me
did
you
find
me
a
fretful
whining
creature
who
never
by
any
chance
wanted
what
she
had
until
she
found
what
she
did
have
and
did
you
open
my
eyes
by
bringing
me
three
kinds
of
things
so
i
have
to
have
what
i
wanted
for
once
oh
mrs
snow
was
i
really
ever
quite
so
impertinent
as
that
murmured
pollyanna
with
a
painful
blush
it
was
impertinent
objected
mrs
snow
stoutly
you
did
mean
it
as
impertinence
and
that
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
you
did
preach
either
my
dear
if
you
had
you
never
have
got
me
to
playing
the
game
nor
anybody
else
i
fancy
but
you
did
get
me
to
playing
it
and
see
what
it
done
for
me
and
for
milly
here
i
am
so
much
better
that
i
can
sit
in
a
wheel
chair
and
go
anywhere
on
this
floor
in
it
that
means
a
whole
lot
when
it
comes
to
waiting
on
yourself
and
giving
those
around
you
a
chance
to
breathe
meaning
milly
in
this
case
and
the
doctor
says
it
all
owing
to
the
game
then
there
others
quantities
of
others
right
in
this
town
that
i
hearing
of
all
the
time
nellie
mahoney
broke
her
wrist
and
was
so
glad
it
was
her
leg
that
she
did
mind
the
wrist
at
all
old
tibbits
has
lost
her
hearing
but
she
so
glad
is
her
eyesight
that
she
actually
happy
do
you
remember
joe
that
they
used
to
call
cross
joe
be
cause
of
his
temper
nothing
went
to
suit
him
either
any
more
than
it
did
me
well
somebody
taught
him
the
game
they
say
and
made
a
different
man
of
him
and
listen
dear
it
not
only
this
town
but
other
places
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
my
cousin
in
massachusetts
and
she
told
me
all
about
tom
payson
that
used
to
live
here
do
you
remember
them
they
lived
on
the
way
up
pendleton
hill
yes
oh
yes
i
remember
them
cried
pollyanna
well
they
left
here
that
winter
you
were
in
the
sanatorium
and
went
to
massachusetts
where
my
sister
lives
she
knows
them
well
she
says
payson
told
her
all
about
you
and
how
your
glad
game
actually
saved
them
from
a
divorce
and
now
not
only
do
they
play
it
themselves
but
they
got
quite
a
lot
of
others
playing
it
down
there
and
they
getting
still
others
so
you
see
dear
there
no
telling
where
that
glad
game
of
yours
is
going
to
stop
i
wanted
you
to
know
i
thought
it
might
help
even
you
to
play
the
game
sometimes
for
do
think
i
do
understand
dearie
that
it
is
hard
for
you
to
play
your
own
game
sometimes
pollyanna
rose
to
her
feet
she
smiled
but
her
eyes
glistened
with
tears
as
she
held
out
her
hand
in
thank
you
mrs
snow
she
said
unsteadily
it
is
hard
sometimes
and
maybe
i
did
need
a
little
help
about
my
own
game
but
anyhow
now
her
eyes
flashed
with
their
old
merriment
if
any
time
i
think
i
ca
play
the
game
myself
i
can
remember
that
i
can
still
always
be
glad
there
are
some
folks
playing
it
pollyanna
walked
home
a
little
soberly
that
afternoon
touched
as
she
was
by
what
mrs
snow
had
said
there
was
yet
an
undercurrent
of
sadness
in
it
all
she
was
thinking
of
aunt
polly
aunt
polly
who
played
the
game
now
so
seldom
and
she
was
wondering
if
she
herself
always
played
it
when
she
might
maybe
i
have
been
careful
always
to
hunt
up
the
glad
side
of
the
things
aunt
polly
says
she
thought
with
undefined
guiltiness
and
maybe
if
i
played
the
game
better
myself
aunt
polly
would
play
it
a
little
anyhow
i
going
to
try
if
i
do
look
out
all
these
other
people
will
be
playing
my
own
game
better
than
i
am
myself
chapter
xxvi
john
pendleton
it
was
just
a
week
before
christmas
that
pollyanna
sent
her
story
now
neatly
typewritten
in
for
the
contest
the
would
not
be
announced
until
april
the
magazine
notice
said
so
pollyanna
settled
herself
for
the
long
wait
with
characteristic
philosophical
patience
i
do
know
anyhow
but
i
glad
is
so
long
she
told
herself
for
all
winter
i
can
have
the
fun
of
thinking
it
may
be
the
first
one
instead
of
one
of
the
others
that
i
get
i
might
just
as
well
think
i
going
to
get
it
then
if
i
do
get
it
i
wo
have
been
unhappy
any
while
if
i
do
get
it
i
wo
have
had
all
these
weeks
of
unhappiness
beforehand
anyway
and
i
can
be
glad
for
one
of
the
smaller
ones
then
that
she
might
not
get
any
prize
was
not
in
pollyanna
calculations
at
all
the
story
so
beautifully
typed
by
milly
snow
looked
almost
as
good
as
printed
already
to
pollyanna
christmas
was
not
a
happy
time
at
the
harrington
homestead
that
year
in
spite
of
pollyanna
strenuous
efforts
to
make
it
so
aunt
polly
refused
absolutely
to
allow
any
sort
of
celebration
of
the
day
and
made
her
attitude
so
unmistakably
plain
that
pollyanna
could
not
give
even
the
simplest
of
presents
christmas
evening
john
pendleton
called
chilton
excused
herself
but
pollyanna
utterly
worn
out
from
a
long
day
with
her
aunt
welcomed
him
joyously
but
even
here
she
found
a
fly
in
the
amber
of
her
content
for
john
pendleton
had
brought
with
him
a
letter
from
jimmy
and
the
letter
was
full
of
nothing
but
the
plans
he
and
carew
were
making
for
a
wonderful
christmas
celebration
at
the
home
for
working
girls
and
pollyanna
ashamed
though
she
was
to
own
it
to
herself
was
not
in
a
mood
to
hear
about
christmas
celebrations
just
then
least
of
all
jimmy
john
pendleton
however
was
not
ready
to
let
the
subject
drop
even
when
the
letter
had
been
read
great
doings
those
he
exclaimed
as
he
folded
the
letter
yes
indeed
fine
murmured
pollyanna
trying
to
speak
with
due
enthusiasm
and
it
too
is
it
i
like
to
drop
in
on
them
about
now
yes
murmured
pollyanna
again
with
still
more
careful
enthusiasm
carew
knew
what
she
was
about
when
she
got
jimmy
to
help
her
i
fancy
chuckled
the
man
but
i
wondering
how
jimmy
likes
it
playing
santa
claus
to
half
a
hundred
young
women
at
once
why
he
finds
it
delightful
of
course
pollyanna
lifted
her
chin
ever
so
slightly
maybe
still
it
a
little
different
from
learning
to
build
bridges
you
must
confess
oh
yes
but
i
risk
jimmy
and
i
risk
wagering
that
those
girls
never
had
a
better
time
than
he
give
them
too
of
course
stammered
pollyanna
trying
to
keep
the
hated
tremulousness
out
of
her
voice
and
trying
very
hard
not
to
compare
her
own
dreary
evening
in
beldingsville
with
nobody
but
john
pendleton
to
that
of
those
fifty
girls
in
boston
with
jimmy
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
john
pendleton
gazed
dreamily
at
the
dancing
fire
on
the
hearth
she
a
wonderful
woman
carew
is
he
said
at
last
she
is
indeed
this
time
the
enthusiasm
in
pollyanna
voice
was
all
pure
gold
jimmy
written
me
before
something
of
what
she
done
for
those
girls
went
on
the
man
still
gazing
into
the
fire
in
just
the
last
letter
before
this
he
wrote
a
lot
about
it
and
about
her
he
said
he
always
admired
her
but
never
so
much
as
now
when
he
can
see
what
she
really
is
she
a
dear
that
what
carew
is
declared
pollyanna
warmly
she
a
dear
in
every
way
and
i
love
her
john
pendleton
stirred
suddenly
he
turned
to
pollyanna
with
an
oddly
whimsical
look
in
his
eyes
i
know
you
do
my
dear
for
that
matter
there
may
be
others
too
that
love
her
pollyanna
heart
skipped
a
beat
a
sudden
thought
came
to
her
with
stunning
blinding
force
jimmy
could
john
pendleton
be
meaning
that
jimmy
cared
that
way
for
carew
you
mean
she
faltered
she
could
not
finish
with
a
nervous
twitch
peculiar
to
him
john
pendleton
got
to
his
feet
i
mean
the
girls
of
course
he
answered
lightly
still
with
that
whimsical
smile
do
you
suppose
those
fifty
girls
love
her
to
death
pollyanna
said
yes
of
course
and
murmured
something
else
appropriate
in
answer
to
john
pendleton
next
remark
but
her
thoughts
were
in
a
tumult
and
she
let
the
man
do
most
of
the
talking
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
nor
did
john
pendleton
seem
averse
to
this
restlessly
he
took
a
turn
or
two
about
the
room
then
sat
down
in
his
old
place
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
on
his
old
subject
carew
queer
about
that
jamie
of
hers
is
it
i
wonder
if
he
is
her
nephew
as
pollyanna
did
not
answer
the
man
went
on
after
a
silence
he
a
fine
fellow
anyway
i
like
him
there
something
fine
and
genuine
about
him
she
bound
up
in
him
that
plain
to
be
seen
whether
he
really
her
kin
or
not
there
was
another
pause
then
in
a
slightly
altered
voice
john
pendleton
said
still
it
queer
too
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
that
she
never
married
again
she
is
certainly
now
a
very
beautiful
woman
do
you
think
so
yes
yes
indeed
she
is
plunged
in
pollyanna
with
precipitate
haste
a
a
very
beautiful
woman
there
was
a
little
break
at
the
last
in
pollyanna
voice
pollyanna
just
then
had
caught
sight
of
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
opposite
and
pollyanna
to
herself
was
never
a
very
beautiful
woman
on
and
on
rambled
john
pendleton
musingly
contentedly
his
eyes
on
the
fire
whether
he
was
answered
or
not
seemed
not
to
disturb
him
whether
he
was
even
listened
to
or
not
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
he
wanted
apparently
only
to
talk
but
at
last
he
got
to
his
feet
reluctantly
and
said
for
a
weary
pollyanna
had
been
longing
for
him
to
go
that
she
might
be
alone
but
after
he
had
gone
she
wished
he
were
back
she
had
found
suddenly
that
she
did
not
want
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
it
was
wonderfully
clear
to
pollyanna
now
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
jimmy
cared
for
carew
that
was
why
he
was
so
moody
and
restless
after
she
left
that
was
why
he
had
come
so
seldom
to
see
her
pollyanna
his
old
friend
that
was
why
countless
little
circumstances
of
the
past
summer
flocked
to
pollyanna
memory
now
mute
witnesses
that
would
not
be
denied
and
why
should
he
not
care
for
her
carew
was
certainly
beautiful
and
charming
true
she
was
older
than
jimmy
but
young
men
had
married
women
far
older
than
she
many
times
and
if
they
loved
each
other
pollyanna
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
in
the
morning
bravely
she
tried
to
face
the
thing
she
even
tried
with
a
tearful
smile
to
put
it
to
the
test
of
the
glad
game
she
was
reminded
then
of
something
nancy
had
said
to
her
years
before
if
there
is
a
set
o
folks
in
the
world
that
would
have
no
use
for
that
glad
game
o
it
be
a
pair
o
quarrellin
lovers
not
that
we
or
even
thought
pollyanna
blushingly
but
just
the
same
i
can
be
glad
he
glad
and
glad
glad
too
only
even
to
herself
pollyanna
could
not
finish
this
sentence
being
so
sure
now
that
jimmy
and
carew
cared
for
each
other
pollyanna
became
peculiarly
sensitive
to
everything
that
tended
to
strengthen
that
belief
and
being
ever
on
the
watch
for
it
she
found
it
as
was
to
be
expected
first
in
carew
letters
i
am
seeing
a
lot
of
your
friend
young
pendleton
carew
wrote
one
day
and
i
liking
him
more
and
more
i
do
wish
however
just
for
curiosity
sake
that
i
could
trace
to
its
source
that
elusive
feeling
that
i
seen
him
before
somewhere
frequently
after
this
she
mentioned
him
casually
and
to
pollyanna
in
the
very
casualness
of
these
references
lay
their
sharpest
sting
for
it
showed
so
unmistakably
that
jimmy
and
jimmy
presence
were
now
to
carew
a
matter
of
course
from
other
sources
too
pollyanna
found
fuel
for
the
fire
of
her
suspicions
more
and
more
frequently
john
pendleton
dropped
in
with
his
stories
of
jimmy
and
of
what
jimmy
was
doing
and
always
here
there
was
mention
of
carew
poor
pollyanna
wondered
indeed
sometimes
if
john
pendleton
could
not
talk
of
anything
but
carew
and
jimmy
so
constantly
was
one
or
the
other
of
those
names
on
his
lips
there
were
sadie
dean
letters
too
and
they
told
of
jimmy
and
of
what
he
was
doing
to
help
carew
even
jamie
who
wrote
occasionally
had
his
mite
to
add
for
he
wrote
one
evening
it
ten
i
sitting
here
alone
waiting
for
carew
to
come
home
she
and
pendleton
have
been
to
one
of
their
usual
socials
down
to
the
home
from
jimmy
himself
pollyanna
heard
very
rarely
and
for
that
she
told
herself
mournfully
that
she
could
be
glad
for
if
he
ca
write
about
anything
but
carew
and
those
girls
i
glad
he
does
write
very
often
she
sighed
chapter
xxvii
the
day
pollyanna
did
not
play
and
so
one
by
one
the
winter
days
passed
january
and
february
slipped
away
in
snow
and
sleet
and
march
came
in
with
a
gale
that
whistled
and
moaned
around
the
old
house
and
set
loose
blinds
to
swinging
and
loose
gates
to
creaking
in
a
way
that
was
most
trying
to
nerves
already
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
pollyanna
was
not
finding
it
very
easy
these
days
to
play
the
game
but
she
was
playing
it
faithfully
valiantly
aunt
polly
was
not
playing
it
at
all
which
certainly
did
not
make
it
any
the
easier
for
pollyanna
to
play
it
aunt
polly
was
blue
and
discouraged
she
was
not
well
too
and
she
had
plainly
abandoned
herself
to
utter
gloom
pollyanna
still
was
counting
on
the
prize
contest
she
had
dropped
from
the
first
prize
to
one
of
the
smaller
ones
however
pollyanna
had
been
writing
more
stories
and
the
regularity
with
which
they
came
back
from
their
pilgrimages
to
magazine
editors
was
beginning
to
shake
her
faith
in
her
success
as
an
author
oh
well
i
can
be
glad
that
aunt
polly
does
know
anything
about
it
anyway
declared
pollyanna
to
herself
bravely
as
she
twisted
in
her
fingers
the
slip
that
had
just
towed
in
one
more
shipwrecked
story
she
ca
worry
about
this
she
does
know
about
it
all
of
pollyanna
life
these
days
revolved
around
aunt
polly
and
it
is
doubtful
if
even
aunt
polly
herself
realized
how
exacting
she
had
become
and
how
entirely
her
niece
was
giving
up
her
life
to
her
it
was
on
a
particularly
gloomy
day
in
march
that
matters
came
in
a
way
to
a
climax
pollyanna
upon
arising
had
looked
at
the
sky
with
a
sigh
aunt
polly
was
always
more
difficult
on
cloudy
days
with
a
gay
little
song
however
that
still
sounded
a
bit
forced
pollyanna
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
began
to
prepare
breakfast
i
reckon
i
make
corn
muffins
she
told
the
stove
confidentially
then
maybe
aunt
polly
wo
mind
other
things
so
much
half
an
hour
later
she
tapped
at
her
aunt
door
up
so
soon
oh
that
fine
and
you
done
your
hair
yourself
i
could
sleep
i
had
to
get
up
sighed
aunt
polly
wearily
i
had
to
do
my
hair
too
you
were
here
but
i
did
suppose
you
were
ready
for
me
auntie
explained
pollyanna
hurriedly
never
mind
though
you
be
glad
i
when
you
find
what
i
been
doing
well
i
not
this
morning
frowned
aunt
polly
perversely
nobody
could
be
glad
this
morning
look
at
it
rain
that
makes
the
third
rainy
day
this
week
that
so
but
you
know
the
sun
never
seems
quite
so
perfectly
lovely
as
it
does
after
a
lot
of
rain
like
this
smiled
pollyanna
deftly
arranging
a
bit
of
lace
and
ribbon
at
her
aunt
throat
now
come
breakfast
all
ready
just
you
wait
till
you
see
what
i
got
for
you
aunt
polly
however
was
not
to
be
diverted
even
by
corn
muffins
this
morning
nothing
was
right
nothing
was
even
endurable
as
she
felt
and
pollyanna
patience
was
sorely
taxed
before
the
meal
was
over
to
make
matters
worse
the
roof
over
the
east
attic
window
was
found
to
be
leaking
and
an
unpleasant
letter
came
in
the
mail
pollyanna
true
to
her
creed
laughingly
declared
that
for
her
part
she
was
glad
they
had
a
roof
to
leak
and
that
as
for
the
letter
she
been
expecting
it
for
a
week
anyway
and
she
was
actually
glad
she
would
have
to
worry
any
more
for
fear
it
would
come
it
could
come
now
because
it
had
come
and
was
over
with
all
this
together
with
sundry
other
hindrances
and
annoyances
delayed
the
usual
morning
work
until
far
into
the
afternoon
something
that
was
always
particularly
displeasing
to
methodical
aunt
polly
who
ordered
her
own
life
preferably
by
the
tick
of
the
clock
but
it
three
pollyanna
already
did
you
know
it
she
fretted
at
last
and
you
have
made
the
beds
yet
no
dearie
but
i
will
do
worry
but
did
you
hear
what
i
said
look
at
the
clock
child
it
after
three
so
is
but
never
mind
aunt
polly
we
can
be
glad
is
after
four
aunt
polly
sniffed
her
disdain
i
suppose
you
can
she
observed
tartly
pollyanna
laughed
well
you
see
auntie
clocks
are
accommodating
things
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it
i
found
that
out
long
ago
at
the
sanatorium
when
i
was
doing
something
that
i
liked
and
i
did
want
the
time
to
go
fast
i
just
look
at
the
hour
hand
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lots
of
time
it
went
so
slow
then
other
days
when
i
had
to
keep
something
that
hurt
on
for
an
hour
maybe
i
watch
the
little
second
hand
and
you
see
then
i
felt
as
if
old
time
was
just
humping
himself
to
help
me
out
by
going
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
now
i
watching
the
hour
hand
i
do
want
time
to
go
fast
see
she
twinkled
mischievously
as
she
hurried
from
the
room
before
aunt
polly
had
time
to
answer
it
was
certainly
a
hard
day
and
by
night
pollyanna
looked
pale
and
worn
out
this
too
was
a
source
of
worriment
to
aunt
polly
dear
me
child
you
look
tired
to
death
she
fumed
what
going
to
do
i
do
know
i
suppose
you
be
sick
next
nonsense
auntie
i
not
sick
a
bit
declared
pollyanna
dropping
herself
with
a
sigh
on
to
the
couch
but
i
am
tired
my
how
good
this
couch
feels
i
glad
i
tired
after
all
it
so
nice
to
rest
aunt
polly
turned
with
an
impatient
gesture
glad
glad
glad
of
course
you
glad
pollyanna
you
always
glad
for
everything
i
never
saw
such
a
girl
oh
yes
i
know
it
the
game
she
went
on
in
answer
to
the
look
that
came
to
face
and
it
a
very
good
game
too
but
i
think
you
carry
it
altogether
too
far
this
eternal
doctrine
of
might
be
worse
has
got
on
my
nerves
pollyanna
honestly
it
would
be
a
real
relief
if
you
would
be
glad
for
something
sometime
why
auntie
pollyanna
pulled
herself
half
erect
well
it
would
you
just
try
it
sometime
and
see
but
auntie
i
pollyanna
stopped
and
eyed
her
aunt
reflectively
an
odd
look
came
to
her
eyes
a
slow
smile
curved
her
lips
chilton
who
had
turned
back
to
her
work
paid
no
heed
and
after
a
minute
pollyanna
lay
back
on
the
couch
without
finishing
her
sentence
the
curious
smile
still
on
her
lips
it
was
raining
again
when
pollyanna
got
up
the
next
morning
and
a
northeast
wind
was
still
whistling
down
the
chimney
pollyanna
at
the
window
drew
an
involuntary
sigh
but
almost
at
once
her
face
changed
oh
well
i
glad
she
clapped
her
hands
to
her
lips
dear
me
she
chuckled
softly
her
eyes
dancing
i
shall
forget
i
know
i
shall
and
that
spoil
it
all
i
must
just
remember
not
to
be
glad
for
anything
not
anything
pollyanna
did
not
make
corn
muffins
that
morning
she
started
the
breakfast
then
went
to
her
aunt
room
chilton
was
still
in
bed
i
see
it
rains
as
usual
she
observed
by
way
of
greeting
yes
it
horrid
perfectly
horrid
scolded
pollyanna
it
rained
every
day
this
week
too
i
hate
such
weather
aunt
polly
turned
with
a
faint
surprise
in
her
eyes
but
pollyanna
was
looking
the
other
way
are
you
going
to
get
up
now
she
asked
a
little
wearily
why
murmured
aunt
polly
still
with
that
faint
surprise
in
her
eyes
what
the
matter
pollyanna
are
you
especially
tired
yes
i
am
tired
this
morning
i
did
sleep
well
either
i
hate
not
to
sleep
things
always
plague
so
in
the
night
when
you
wake
up
i
guess
i
know
that
fretted
aunt
polly
i
did
sleep
a
wink
after
two
myself
and
there
that
roof
how
are
we
going
to
have
it
fixed
pray
if
it
never
stops
raining
have
you
been
up
to
empty
the
pans
oh
yes
and
took
up
some
more
there
a
new
leak
now
further
over
a
new
one
why
it
all
be
leaking
yet
pollyanna
opened
her
lips
she
had
almost
said
well
we
can
be
glad
to
have
it
fixed
all
at
once
then
when
she
suddenly
remembered
and
substituted
in
a
tired
voice
very
likely
it
will
auntie
it
looks
like
it
now
fast
enough
anyway
it
made
fuss
enough
for
a
whole
roof
already
and
i
sick
of
it
with
which
statement
pollyanna
her
face
carefully
averted
turned
and
trailed
listlessly
out
of
the
room
it
so
funny
and
so
so
hard
i
afraid
i
making
a
mess
of
it
she
whispered
to
herself
anxiously
as
she
hurried
to
the
kitchen
behind
her
aunt
polly
in
the
bedroom
gazed
after
her
with
eyes
that
were
again
faintly
puzzled
aunt
polly
had
occasion
a
good
many
times
before
six
that
night
to
gaze
at
pollyanna
with
surprised
and
questioning
eyes
nothing
was
right
with
pollyanna
the
fire
would
not
burn
the
wind
blew
one
particular
blind
loose
three
times
and
still
a
third
leak
was
discovered
in
the
roof
the
mail
brought
to
pollyanna
a
letter
that
made
her
cry
though
no
amount
of
questioning
on
aunt
part
would
persuade
her
to
tell
why
even
the
dinner
went
wrong
and
innumerable
things
happened
in
the
afternoon
to
call
out
fretful
discouraged
remarks
not
until
the
day
was
more
than
half
gone
did
a
look
of
shrewd
suspicion
suddenly
fight
for
supremacy
with
the
puzzled
questioning
in
aunt
polly
eyes
if
pollyanna
saw
this
she
made
no
sign
certainly
there
was
no
abatement
in
her
fretfulness
and
discontent
long
before
six
however
the
suspicion
in
aunt
polly
eyes
became
conviction
and
drove
to
ignominious
defeat
the
puzzled
questioning
but
curiously
enough
then
a
new
look
came
to
take
its
place
a
look
that
was
actually
a
twinkle
of
amusement
at
last
after
a
particularly
doleful
complaint
on
pollyanna
part
aunt
polly
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
that
do
that
do
child
i
give
up
i
confess
myself
beaten
at
my
own
game
you
can
be
glad
for
that
if
you
like
she
finished
with
a
grim
smile
i
know
auntie
but
you
said
began
pollyanna
demurely
yes
yes
but
i
never
will
again
interrupted
aunt
polly
with
emphasis
mercy
what
a
day
this
has
been
i
never
want
to
live
through
another
like
it
she
hesitated
flushed
a
little
then
went
on
with
evident
difficulty
furthermore
i
i
want
you
to
know
that
that
i
understand
i
have
played
the
game
myself
very
well
lately
but
after
this
i
going
to
to
try
where
my
handkerchief
she
finished
sharply
fumbling
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
pollyanna
sprang
to
her
feet
and
crossed
instantly
to
her
aunt
side
oh
but
aunt
polly
i
did
mean
it
was
just
a
a
joke
she
quavered
in
quick
distress
i
never
thought
of
your
taking
it
that
way
of
course
you
did
snapped
aunt
polly
with
all
the
asperity
of
a
stern
repressed
woman
who
abhors
scenes
and
sentiment
and
who
is
mortally
afraid
she
will
show
that
her
heart
has
been
touched
you
suppose
i
know
you
did
mean
it
that
way
do
you
think
if
i
thought
you
had
been
trying
to
teach
me
a
lesson
that
i
i
but
pollyanna
strong
young
arms
had
her
in
a
close
embrace
and
she
could
not
finish
the
sentence
chapter
xxviii
jimmy
and
jamie
pollyanna
was
not
the
only
one
that
was
finding
that
winter
a
hard
one
in
boston
jimmy
pendleton
in
spite
of
his
strenuous
efforts
to
occupy
his
time
and
thoughts
was
discovering
that
nothing
quite
erased
from
his
vision
a
certain
pair
of
laughing
blue
eyes
and
nothing
quite
obliterated
from
his
memory
a
certain
merry
voice
jimmy
told
himself
that
if
it
were
not
for
carew
and
the
fact
that
he
could
be
of
some
use
to
her
life
would
not
be
worth
the
living
even
at
carew
it
was
not
all
joy
for
always
there
was
jamie
and
jamie
brought
thoughts
of
pollyanna
unhappy
thoughts
being
thoroughly
convinced
that
jamie
and
pollyanna
cared
for
each
other
and
also
being
equally
convinced
that
he
himself
was
in
honor
bound
to
step
one
side
and
give
the
handicapped
jamie
full
right
of
way
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
question
further
of
pollyanna
he
did
not
like
to
talk
or
to
hear
he
knew
that
both
jamie
and
carew
heard
from
her
and
when
they
spoke
of
her
he
forced
himself
to
listen
in
spite
of
his
heartache
but
he
always
changed
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
limited
his
own
letters
to
her
to
the
briefest
and
most
infrequent
epistles
possible
for
to
jimmy
a
pollyanna
that
was
not
his
was
nothing
but
a
source
of
pain
and
wretchedness
and
he
had
been
so
glad
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
leave
beldingsville
and
take
up
his
studies
again
in
boston
to
be
so
near
pollyanna
and
yet
so
far
from
her
he
had
found
to
be
nothing
but
torture
in
boston
with
all
the
feverishness
of
a
restless
mind
that
seeks
distraction
from
itself
he
had
thrown
himself
into
the
carrying
out
of
carew
plans
for
her
beloved
working
girls
and
such
time
as
could
be
spared
from
his
own
duties
he
had
devoted
to
this
work
much
to
carew
delight
and
gratitude
and
so
for
jimmy
the
winter
had
passed
and
spring
had
come
a
joyous
blossoming
spring
full
of
soft
breezes
gentle
showers
and
tender
green
buds
expanding
into
riotous
bloom
and
fragrance
to
jimmy
however
it
was
anything
but
a
joyous
spring
for
in
his
heart
was
still
nothing
but
a
gloomy
winter
of
discontent
if
only
they
settle
things
and
announce
the
engagement
once
for
all
murmured
jimmy
to
himself
more
and
more
frequently
these
days
if
only
i
could
know
something
for
sure
i
think
i
could
stand
it
better
then
one
day
late
in
april
he
had
his
wish
a
part
of
it
he
learned
something
for
sure
it
was
ten
on
a
saturday
morning
and
mary
at
carew
had
ushered
him
into
the
with
a
i
tell
carew
you
here
sir
she
expecting
you
i
think
in
the
jimmy
had
found
himself
brought
to
a
dismayed
halt
by
the
sight
of
jamie
at
the
piano
his
arms
outflung
upon
the
rack
and
his
head
bowed
upon
them
pendleton
had
half
turned
to
beat
a
soft
retreat
when
the
man
at
the
piano
lifted
his
head
bringing
into
view
two
flushed
cheeks
and
a
pair
of
eyes
why
carew
stammered
pendleton
aghast
has
anything
er
happened
happened
happened
ejaculated
the
lame
youth
flinging
out
both
his
hands
in
each
of
which
as
pendleton
now
saw
was
an
open
letter
everything
has
happened
would
you
think
it
had
if
all
your
life
you
been
in
prison
and
suddenly
you
saw
the
gates
flung
wide
open
would
you
think
it
had
if
all
in
a
minute
you
could
ask
the
girl
you
loved
to
be
your
wife
would
you
think
it
had
if
but
listen
you
think
i
crazy
but
i
not
though
maybe
i
am
after
all
crazy
with
joy
i
like
to
tell
you
may
i
i
got
to
tell
somebody
pendleton
lifted
his
head
it
was
as
if
unconsciously
he
was
bracing
himself
for
a
blow
he
had
grown
a
little
white
but
his
voice
was
quite
steady
when
he
answered
sure
you
may
old
fellow
i
be
glad
to
hear
it
carew
however
had
scarcely
waited
for
assent
he
was
rushing
on
still
a
bit
incoherently
it
not
much
to
you
of
course
you
have
two
feet
and
your
freedom
you
have
your
ambitions
and
your
bridges
but
i
to
me
everything
it
a
chance
to
live
a
man
life
and
do
a
man
work
perhaps
even
if
it
is
dams
and
bridges
it
something
and
something
i
proved
now
i
can
do
listen
in
that
letter
there
is
the
announcement
that
a
little
story
of
mine
has
won
the
first
prize
in
a
contest
in
that
other
letter
there
a
big
publishing
house
accepts
with
flattering
enthusiasm
my
first
book
manuscript
for
publication
and
they
both
came
this
morning
do
you
wonder
i
am
crazy
glad
no
no
indeed
i
congratulate
you
carew
with
all
my
heart
cried
jimmy
warmly
thank
you
and
you
may
congratulate
me
think
what
it
means
to
me
think
what
it
means
if
by
and
by
i
can
be
independent
like
a
man
think
what
it
means
if
i
can
some
day
make
carew
proud
and
glad
that
she
gave
the
crippled
lad
a
place
in
her
home
and
heart
think
what
it
means
for
me
to
be
able
to
tell
the
girl
i
love
that
i
do
love
her
yes
yes
indeed
old
boy
jimmy
spoke
firmly
though
he
had
grown
very
white
now
of
course
maybe
i
ought
not
to
do
that
last
even
now
resumed
jamie
a
swift
cloud
shadowing
the
shining
brightness
of
his
countenance
i
still
tied
to
these
he
tapped
the
crutches
by
his
side
i
ca
forget
of
course
that
day
in
the
woods
last
summer
when
i
saw
pollyanna
i
realize
that
always
i
have
to
run
the
chance
of
seeing
the
girl
i
love
in
danger
and
not
being
able
to
rescue
her
oh
but
carew
began
the
other
huskily
carew
lifted
a
peremptory
hand
i
know
what
you
say
but
do
say
it
you
ca
understand
you
are
tied
to
two
sticks
you
did
the
rescuing
not
i
it
came
to
me
then
how
it
would
be
always
with
me
and
sadie
i
have
to
stand
aside
and
see
others
sadie
cut
in
jimmy
sharply
yes
sadie
dean
you
act
surprised
did
you
know
have
you
suspected
how
i
felt
toward
sadie
cried
jamie
have
i
kept
it
so
well
to
myself
then
i
tried
to
but
he
finished
with
a
faint
smile
and
a
gesture
well
you
certainly
kept
it
all
right
old
fellow
from
me
anyhow
cried
jimmy
gayly
the
color
had
come
back
to
jimmy
face
in
a
rich
flood
and
his
eyes
had
grown
suddenly
very
bright
indeed
so
sadie
dean
good
i
congratulate
you
again
i
do
i
do
as
nancy
says
jimmy
was
quite
babbling
with
joy
and
excitement
now
so
great
and
wonderful
had
been
the
reaction
within
him
at
the
discovery
that
it
was
sadie
not
pollyanna
whom
jamie
loved
jamie
flushed
and
shook
his
head
a
bit
sadly
no
congratulations
yet
you
see
i
have
spoken
to
her
but
i
think
she
must
know
i
supposed
everybody
knew
pray
whom
did
you
think
it
was
if
not
sadie
jimmy
hesitated
then
a
little
precipitately
he
let
it
out
why
i
thought
of
pollyanna
jamie
smiled
and
pursed
his
lips
pollyanna
a
charming
girl
and
i
love
her
but
not
that
way
any
more
than
she
does
me
besides
i
fancy
somebody
else
would
have
something
to
say
about
that
eh
jimmy
colored
like
a
happy
conscious
boy
do
you
he
challenged
trying
to
make
his
voice
properly
impersonal
of
course
john
pendleton
john
pendleton
jimmy
wheeled
sharply
what
about
john
pendleton
queried
a
new
voice
and
carew
came
forward
with
a
smile
jimmy
around
whose
ears
for
the
second
time
within
five
minutes
the
world
had
crashed
into
fragments
barely
collected
himself
enough
for
a
low
word
of
greeting
but
jamie
unabashed
turned
with
a
triumphant
air
of
assurance
nothing
only
i
just
said
that
i
believed
john
pendleton
would
have
something
to
say
about
pollyanna
loving
anybody
but
him
pollyanna
john
pendleton
carew
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
chair
nearest
her
if
the
two
men
before
her
had
not
been
so
deeply
absorbed
in
their
own
affairs
they
might
have
noticed
that
the
smile
had
vanished
from
carew
lips
and
that
an
odd
look
as
of
almost
fear
had
come
to
her
eyes
certainly
maintained
jamie
were
you
both
blind
last
summer
was
he
with
her
a
lot
why
i
thought
he
was
with
all
of
us
murmured
carew
a
little
faintly
not
as
he
was
with
pollyanna
insisted
jamie
besides
have
you
forgotten
that
day
when
we
were
talking
about
john
marrying
and
pollyanna
blushed
and
stammered
and
said
finally
that
he
had
thought
of
marrying
once
well
i
wondered
then
if
there
something
between
them
do
you
remember
i
think
i
do
now
that
you
speak
of
it
murmured
carew
again
but
i
had
forgotten
it
oh
but
i
can
explain
that
cut
in
jimmy
wetting
his
dry
lips
john
pendleton
did
have
a
love
affair
once
but
it
was
with
pollyanna
mother
pollyanna
mother
exclaimed
two
voices
in
surprise
yes
he
loved
her
years
ago
but
she
did
not
care
for
him
at
all
i
understand
she
had
another
lover
a
minister
and
she
married
him
instead
pollyanna
father
breathed
carew
leaning
forward
suddenly
in
her
chair
and
is
that
why
he
never
married
yes
avouched
jimmy
so
you
see
there
really
nothing
to
that
idea
at
all
that
he
cares
for
pollyanna
it
was
her
mother
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
makes
a
whole
lot
to
that
idea
declared
jamie
wagging
his
head
wisely
i
think
it
makes
my
case
all
the
stronger
listen
he
once
loved
the
mother
he
could
have
her
what
more
absolutely
natural
than
that
he
should
love
the
daughter
now
and
win
her
oh
jamie
you
incorrigible
spinner
of
tales
reproached
carew
with
a
nervous
laugh
this
is
no
novel
it
real
life
she
too
young
for
him
he
ought
to
marry
a
woman
not
a
girl
that
is
if
he
marries
any
one
i
mean
she
stammeringly
corrected
a
sudden
flood
of
color
in
her
face
perhaps
but
what
if
it
happens
to
be
a
girl
that
he
loves
argued
jamie
stubbornly
and
really
just
stop
to
think
have
we
had
a
single
letter
from
her
that
has
told
of
his
being
there
and
you
know
how
he
always
talking
of
pollyanna
in
his
letters
carew
got
suddenly
to
her
feet
yes
i
know
she
murmured
with
an
odd
little
gesture
as
if
throwing
something
distasteful
aside
but
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
and
a
moment
later
she
had
left
the
room
when
she
came
back
in
five
minutes
she
found
much
to
her
surprise
that
jimmy
had
gone
why
i
thought
he
was
going
with
us
on
the
girls
picnic
she
exclaimed
so
did
i
frowned
jamie
but
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
was
explaining
or
apologizing
or
something
about
unexpectedly
having
to
leave
town
and
he
come
to
tell
you
he
could
go
with
us
anyhow
the
next
thing
i
knew
he
gone
you
see
jamie
eyes
were
glowing
again
i
do
think
i
knew
quite
what
he
did
say
anyway
i
had
something
else
to
think
of
and
he
jubilantly
spread
before
her
the
two
letters
which
all
the
time
he
had
still
kept
in
his
hands
oh
jamie
breathed
carew
when
she
had
read
the
letters
through
how
proud
i
am
of
you
then
suddenly
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
look
of
ineffable
joy
that
illumined
jamie
face
chapter
xxix
jimmy
and
john
it
was
a
very
determined
young
man
that
alighted
at
the
beldingsville
station
late
that
saturday
night
and
it
was
an
even
more
determined
young
man
that
before
ten
the
next
morning
stalked
through
the
village
streets
and
climbed
the
hill
to
the
harrington
homestead
catching
sight
of
a
loved
and
familiar
flaxen
coil
of
hair
on
a
little
head
just
disappearing
into
the
summerhouse
the
young
man
ignored
the
conventional
front
steps
and
doorbell
crossed
the
lawn
and
strode
through
the
garden
paths
until
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
owner
of
the
flaxen
coil
of
hair
jimmy
gasped
pollyanna
falling
back
with
startled
eyes
why
where
did
you
come
from
boston
last
night
i
had
to
see
you
pollyanna
to
see
pollyanna
was
plainly
fencing
for
time
to
regain
her
composure
jimmy
looked
so
big
and
strong
and
dear
there
in
the
door
of
the
summerhouse
that
she
feared
her
eyes
had
been
surprised
into
a
telltale
admiration
if
not
more
yes
pollyanna
i
wanted
that
is
i
thought
i
mean
i
feared
oh
hang
it
all
pollyanna
i
ca
beat
about
the
bush
like
this
have
to
come
straight
to
the
point
it
just
this
i
stood
aside
before
but
i
wo
now
it
is
a
case
any
longer
of
fairness
he
is
crippled
like
jamie
he
got
feet
and
hands
and
a
head
like
mine
and
if
he
wins
he
have
to
win
in
a
fair
fight
i
got
some
rights
pollyanna
stared
frankly
jimmy
bean
pendleton
whatever
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
she
demanded
the
young
man
laughed
shamefacedly
no
wonder
you
do
know
it
was
very
lucid
was
it
but
i
think
i
been
really
lucid
myself
since
yesterday
when
i
found
out
from
jamie
himself
found
out
from
jamie
yes
it
was
the
prize
that
started
it
you
see
he
just
got
one
and
oh
i
know
about
that
interrupted
pollyanna
eagerly
and
it
splendid
just
think
the
first
one
three
thousand
dollars
i
wrote
him
a
letter
last
night
why
when
i
saw
his
name
and
realized
it
was
jamie
our
jamie
i
was
so
excited
i
forgot
all
about
looking
for
my
name
and
even
when
i
could
find
mine
at
all
and
knew
that
i
had
got
any
i
mean
i
was
so
excited
and
pleased
for
jamie
that
i
i
forgot
er
everything
else
corrected
pollyanna
throwing
a
dismayed
glance
into
jimmy
face
and
feverishly
trying
to
cover
up
the
partial
admission
she
had
made
jimmy
however
was
too
intent
on
his
own
problem
to
notice
hers
yes
yes
was
fine
of
course
i
glad
he
got
it
but
pollyanna
it
was
what
he
said
afterward
that
i
mean
you
see
until
then
thought
that
that
he
cared
that
you
cared
for
each
other
i
mean
and
you
thought
that
jamie
and
i
cared
for
each
other
exclaimed
pollyanna
into
whose
face
now
was
stealing
a
soft
shy
color
why
jimmy
it
sadie
dean
was
always
sadie
dean
he
used
to
talk
of
her
to
me
by
the
hour
i
think
she
likes
him
too
good
i
hope
she
does
but
you
see
i
did
know
i
thought
was
jamie
and
you
and
i
thought
that
because
he
was
was
a
cripple
you
know
that
it
would
be
fair
if
i
if
i
stayed
around
and
tried
to
win
you
myself
pollyanna
stooped
suddenly
and
picked
up
a
leaf
at
her
feet
when
she
rose
her
face
was
turned
quite
away
a
fellow
ca
ca
feel
square
you
know
running
a
race
with
a
chap
that
that
handicapped
from
the
start
so
i
i
just
stayed
away
and
gave
him
his
chance
though
it
broke
my
heart
to
do
it
little
girl
it
just
did
then
yesterday
morning
i
found
out
but
i
found
out
something
else
too
jamie
says
there
is
is
somebody
else
in
the
case
but
i
ca
stand
aside
for
him
pollyanna
i
ca
even
in
spite
of
all
he
done
for
me
john
pendleton
is
a
man
and
got
two
whole
feet
for
the
race
he
got
to
take
his
chances
if
you
care
for
him
if
you
really
care
for
him
but
pollyanna
had
turned
john
pendleton
jimmy
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
saying
about
john
pendleton
a
great
joy
transfigured
jimmy
face
he
held
out
both
his
hands
then
you
do
you
do
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
that
you
do
care
pollyanna
shrank
back
she
was
white
and
trembling
jimmy
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
she
begged
piteously
i
mean
you
do
care
for
uncle
john
that
way
do
you
understand
jamie
thinks
you
do
care
and
that
anyway
he
cares
for
you
and
then
i
began
to
see
it
that
maybe
he
did
he
always
talking
about
you
and
of
course
there
was
your
mother
pollyanna
gave
a
low
moan
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
jimmy
came
close
and
laid
a
caressing
arm
about
her
shoulders
but
again
pollyanna
shrank
from
him
pollyanna
little
girl
do
you
break
my
heart
he
begged
do
you
care
for
me
any
is
it
that
and
you
do
want
to
tell
me
she
dropped
her
hands
and
faced
him
her
eyes
had
the
hunted
look
of
some
wild
thing
at
bay
jimmy
do
you
think
he
cares
for
me
that
way
she
entreated
just
above
a
whisper
jimmy
gave
his
head
an
impatient
shake
never
mind
that
pollyanna
now
i
do
know
of
course
how
should
i
but
dearest
that
is
the
question
it
you
if
you
do
care
for
him
and
if
you
only
give
me
a
chance
half
a
chance
to
let
me
make
you
care
for
me
he
caught
her
hand
and
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
no
no
jimmy
i
must
i
ca
with
both
her
little
palms
she
pushed
him
from
her
pollyanna
you
do
mean
you
do
care
for
him
jimmy
face
whitened
no
no
indeed
not
that
way
faltered
pollyanna
but
do
you
see
if
he
cares
for
me
i
have
to
to
learn
to
someway
pollyanna
do
do
look
at
me
like
that
jimmy
you
mean
you
marry
him
pollyanna
oh
no
i
mean
why
er
i
suppose
so
she
admitted
faintly
pollyanna
you
would
you
could
pollyanna
you
breaking
my
heart
pollyanna
gave
a
low
sob
her
face
was
in
her
hands
again
for
a
moment
she
sobbed
on
chokingly
then
with
a
tragic
gesture
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
straight
into
jimmy
anguished
reproachful
eyes
i
know
it
i
know
it
she
chattered
frenziedly
i
breaking
mine
too
but
i
have
to
do
it
i
break
your
heart
i
break
mine
but
i
never
break
his
jimmy
raised
his
head
his
eyes
flashed
a
sudden
fire
his
whole
appearance
underwent
a
swift
and
marvelous
change
with
a
tender
triumphant
cry
he
swept
pollyanna
into
his
arms
and
held
her
close
now
i
know
you
care
for
me
he
breathed
low
in
her
ear
you
said
it
was
breaking
your
heart
too
do
you
think
i
give
you
up
now
to
any
man
on
earth
ah
dear
you
little
understand
a
love
like
mine
if
you
think
i
give
you
up
now
pollyanna
say
you
love
me
say
it
with
your
own
dear
lips
for
one
long
minute
pollyanna
lay
unresisting
in
the
fiercely
tender
embrace
that
encircled
her
then
with
a
sigh
that
was
half
content
half
renunciation
she
began
to
draw
herself
away
yes
jimmy
i
do
love
you
jimmy
arms
tightened
and
would
have
drawn
her
back
to
him
but
something
in
the
girl
face
forbade
i
love
you
dearly
but
i
could
ever
be
happy
with
you
and
feel
that
jimmy
do
you
see
dear
i
have
to
know
that
i
free
first
nonsense
pollyanna
of
course
you
free
jimmy
eyes
were
mutinous
again
pollyanna
shook
her
head
not
with
this
hanging
over
me
jimmy
do
you
see
it
was
mother
long
ago
that
broke
his
heart
my
mother
and
all
these
years
lived
a
lonely
unloved
life
in
consequence
if
now
he
should
come
to
me
and
ask
me
to
make
that
up
to
him
i
have
to
do
it
jimmy
have
to
i
could
refuse
do
you
see
but
jimmy
did
not
see
he
could
not
see
he
would
not
see
though
pollyanna
pleaded
and
argued
long
and
tearfully
but
pollyanna
too
was
obdurate
though
so
sweetly
and
heartbrokenly
obdurate
that
jimmy
in
spite
of
his
pain
and
anger
felt
almost
like
turning
comforter
jimmy
dear
said
pollyanna
at
last
we
have
to
wait
all
i
can
say
now
i
hope
he
does
care
and
i
i
do
believe
he
does
care
but
i
got
to
know
i
got
to
be
sure
we
just
have
to
wait
a
little
till
we
find
out
jimmy
till
we
find
out
and
to
this
plan
jimmy
had
to
submit
though
it
was
with
a
most
rebellious
heart
all
right
little
girl
it
have
to
be
as
you
say
of
course
he
despaired
but
surely
never
before
was
a
man
kept
waiting
for
his
answer
till
the
girl
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
found
out
if
the
other
man
wanted
her
i
know
but
you
see
dear
never
before
had
the
other
man
wanted
her
mother
sighed
pollyanna
her
face
puckered
into
an
anxious
frown
very
well
i
go
back
to
boston
of
course
acceded
jimmy
reluctantly
but
you
need
think
i
given
up
because
i
have
nor
i
give
up
just
so
long
as
i
know
you
really
care
for
me
my
little
sweetheart
he
finished
with
a
look
that
sent
her
palpitatingly
into
retreat
just
out
of
reach
of
his
arms
chapter
xxx
john
pendleton
turns
the
key
jimmy
went
back
to
boston
that
night
in
a
state
that
was
a
most
tantalizing
commingling
of
happiness
hope
exasperation
and
rebellion
behind
him
he
left
a
girl
who
was
in
a
scarcely
less
enviable
frame
of
mind
for
pollyanna
tremulously
happy
in
the
wondrous
thought
of
jimmy
love
for
her
was
yet
so
despairingly
terrified
at
the
thought
of
the
possible
love
of
john
pendleton
that
there
was
not
a
thrill
of
joy
that
did
not
carry
its
pang
of
fear
fortunately
for
all
concerned
however
this
state
of
affairs
was
not
of
long
duration
for
as
it
chanced
john
pendleton
in
whose
unwitting
hands
lay
the
key
to
the
situation
in
less
than
a
week
after
jimmy
hurried
visit
turned
that
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
of
doubt
it
was
late
thursday
afternoon
that
john
pendleton
called
to
see
pollyanna
as
it
happened
he
like
jimmy
saw
pollyanna
in
the
garden
and
came
straight
toward
her
pollyanna
looking
into
his
face
felt
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
it
come
it
come
she
shivered
and
involuntarily
she
turned
as
if
to
flee
illustration
involuntarily
she
turned
as
if
to
flee
oh
pollyanna
wait
a
minute
please
called
the
man
hastening
his
steps
you
just
the
one
i
wanted
to
see
come
ca
we
go
in
here
he
suggested
turning
toward
the
summerhouse
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
something
why
of
course
stammered
pollyanna
with
forced
gayety
pollyanna
knew
that
she
was
blushing
and
she
particularly
wished
not
to
blush
just
then
it
did
not
help
matters
any
either
that
he
should
have
elected
to
go
into
the
summerhouse
for
his
talk
the
summerhouse
now
to
pollyanna
was
sacred
to
certain
dear
memories
of
jimmy
and
to
think
it
should
be
here
here
she
was
shuddering
frantically
but
aloud
she
said
still
gayly
it
a
lovely
evening
is
it
there
was
no
answer
john
pendleton
strode
into
the
summerhouse
and
dropped
himself
into
a
rustic
chair
without
even
waiting
for
pollyanna
to
seat
herself
a
most
unusual
proceeding
on
the
part
of
john
pendleton
pollyanna
stealing
a
nervous
glance
at
his
face
found
it
so
startlingly
like
the
old
stern
sour
visage
of
her
remembrance
that
she
uttered
an
involuntary
exclamation
still
john
pendleton
paid
no
heed
still
moodily
he
sat
wrapped
in
thought
at
last
however
he
lifted
his
head
and
gazed
somberly
into
pollyanna
startled
eyes
pollyanna
yes
mr
pendleton
do
you
remember
the
sort
of
man
i
was
when
you
first
knew
me
years
ago
why
i
think
so
delightfully
agreeable
specimen
of
humanity
was
i
in
spite
of
her
perturbation
pollyanna
smiled
faintly
i
liked
you
sir
not
until
the
words
were
uttered
did
pollyanna
realize
just
how
they
would
sound
she
strove
then
frantically
to
recall
or
modify
them
and
had
almost
added
a
that
is
i
mean
i
liked
you
then
when
she
stopped
just
in
time
certainly
that
would
not
have
helped
matters
any
she
listened
then
fearfully
for
john
pendleton
next
words
they
came
almost
at
once
i
know
you
did
bless
your
little
heart
and
it
was
that
that
was
the
saving
of
me
i
wonder
pollyanna
if
i
could
ever
make
you
realize
just
what
your
childish
trust
and
liking
did
for
me
pollyanna
stammered
a
confused
protest
but
he
brushed
it
smilingly
aside
oh
yes
it
was
it
was
you
and
no
one
else
i
wonder
if
you
remember
another
thing
too
resumed
the
man
after
a
silence
during
which
pollyanna
looked
furtively
but
longingly
toward
the
door
i
wonder
if
you
remember
my
telling
you
once
that
nothing
but
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
child
presence
could
make
a
home
pollyanna
felt
the
blood
rush
to
her
face
i
mean
yes
i
remember
it
she
stuttered
but
i
i
do
think
it
always
so
now
i
mean
that
is
i
sure
your
home
now
is
is
lovely
just
as
is
and
but
it
my
home
i
talking
about
child
interrupted
the
man
impatiently
pollyanna
you
know
the
kind
of
home
i
once
hoped
to
have
and
how
those
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
do
think
dear
i
blaming
your
mother
i
not
she
but
obeyed
her
heart
which
was
right
and
she
made
the
wiser
choice
anyway
as
was
proved
by
the
dreary
waste
i
made
of
life
because
of
that
disappointment
after
all
pollyanna
is
it
strange
added
john
pendleton
his
voice
growing
tender
that
it
should
be
the
little
hand
of
her
own
daughter
that
led
me
into
the
path
of
happiness
at
last
pollyanna
moistened
her
lips
convulsively
oh
but
pendleton
i
i
once
again
the
man
brushed
aside
her
protests
with
a
smiling
gesture
yes
it
was
pollyanna
your
little
hand
in
the
long
ago
you
and
your
glad
game
pollyanna
relaxed
visibly
in
her
seat
the
terror
in
her
eyes
began
slowly
to
recede
and
so
all
these
years
i
been
gradually
growing
into
a
different
man
pollyanna
but
there
one
thing
i
have
changed
in
my
dear
he
paused
looked
away
then
turned
gravely
tender
eyes
back
to
her
face
i
still
think
it
takes
a
woman
hand
and
heart
or
a
presence
to
make
a
home
yes
you
the
child
presence
plunged
in
pollyanna
the
terror
coming
back
to
her
eyes
there
jimmy
you
know
the
man
gave
an
amused
laugh
i
know
but
i
do
think
even
you
would
say
that
jimmy
is
is
exactly
a
child
presence
any
longer
he
remarked
of
course
not
besides
pollyanna
i
made
up
my
mind
i
got
to
have
the
woman
hand
and
heart
his
voice
dropped
and
trembled
a
little
have
you
pollyanna
fingers
met
and
clutched
each
other
in
a
spasmodic
clasp
john
pendleton
however
seemed
neither
to
hear
nor
see
he
had
leaped
to
his
feet
and
was
nervously
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
house
pollyanna
he
stopped
and
faced
her
if
if
you
were
i
and
were
going
to
ask
the
woman
you
loved
to
come
and
make
your
old
gray
pile
of
stone
a
home
how
would
you
go
to
work
to
do
it
pollyanna
half
started
from
her
chair
her
eyes
sought
the
door
this
time
openly
longingly
oh
but
pendleton
i
would
do
it
at
all
at
all
she
stammered
a
little
wildly
i
sure
you
be
much
happier
as
as
you
are
the
man
stared
in
puzzled
surprise
then
laughed
grimly
upon
my
word
pollyanna
is
it
quite
so
bad
as
that
he
asked
pollyanna
had
the
appearance
of
being
poised
for
flight
yes
is
that
just
your
way
of
trying
to
soften
the
blow
of
saying
that
you
do
think
she
have
me
anyway
oh
no
indeed
she
say
yes
she
have
to
say
yes
you
know
explained
pollyanna
with
terrified
earnestness
but
i
been
thinking
i
mean
i
was
thinking
that
if
if
the
girl
did
love
you
you
really
would
be
happier
without
her
and
at
the
look
that
came
into
john
pendleton
face
pollyanna
stopped
short
i
should
want
her
if
she
did
love
me
pollyanna
no
i
thought
not
too
pollyanna
began
to
look
a
little
less
distracted
besides
she
does
happen
to
be
a
girl
went
on
john
pendleton
she
a
mature
woman
who
presumedly
would
know
her
own
mind
the
man
voice
was
grave
and
slightly
reproachful
oh
exclaimed
pollyanna
the
dawning
happiness
in
her
eyes
leaping
forth
in
a
flash
of
ineffable
joy
and
relief
then
you
love
somebody
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
pollyanna
choked
off
the
else
before
it
left
her
delighted
lips
love
somebody
have
i
just
been
telling
you
i
did
laughed
john
pendleton
half
vexedly
what
i
want
to
know
is
can
she
be
made
to
love
me
that
where
i
was
sort
of
of
counting
on
your
help
pollyanna
you
see
she
a
dear
friend
of
yours
is
she
gurgled
pollyanna
then
she
just
have
to
love
you
make
her
maybe
she
does
anyway
already
who
is
she
there
was
a
long
pause
before
the
answer
came
i
believe
after
all
pollyanna
i
wo
yes
i
will
too
it
ca
you
guess
mrs
carew
oh
breathed
pollyanna
with
a
face
of
unclouded
joy
how
perfectly
lovely
i
so
glad
glad
glad
a
long
hour
later
pollyanna
sent
jimmy
a
letter
it
was
confused
and
incoherent
a
series
of
illogical
but
shyly
joyous
sentences
out
of
which
jimmy
gathered
much
a
little
from
what
was
written
more
from
what
was
left
unwritten
after
all
did
he
really
need
more
than
this
oh
jimmy
he
does
love
me
a
bit
it
some
one
else
i
tell
you
who
it
is
but
her
name
is
pollyanna
jimmy
had
just
time
to
catch
the
seven
train
for
beldingsville
and
he
caught
it
chapter
xxxi
after
long
years
pollyanna
was
so
happy
that
night
after
she
had
sent
her
letter
to
jimmy
that
she
could
not
quite
keep
it
to
herself
always
before
going
to
bed
she
stepped
into
her
aunt
room
to
see
if
anything
were
needed
after
the
usual
questions
she
had
turned
to
put
out
the
light
when
a
sudden
impulse
sent
her
back
to
her
aunt
bedside
a
little
breathlessly
she
dropped
on
her
knees
aunt
polly
i
so
happy
i
just
had
to
tell
some
one
i
want
to
tell
you
may
i
tell
me
tell
me
what
child
of
course
you
may
tell
me
you
mean
it
good
news
for
me
why
yes
dear
i
hope
so
blushed
pollyanna
i
hope
it
will
make
you
glad
a
little
for
me
you
know
of
course
jimmy
will
tell
you
himself
all
properly
some
day
but
wanted
to
tell
you
first
jimmy
chilton
face
changed
perceptibly
yes
when
when
he
he
asks
you
for
me
stammered
pollyanna
with
a
radiant
flood
of
color
oh
i
i
so
happy
i
had
to
tell
you
asks
me
for
you
pollyanna
chilton
pulled
herself
up
in
bed
you
do
mean
to
say
there
anything
serious
between
you
and
jimmy
bean
pollyanna
fell
back
in
dismay
why
auntie
i
thought
you
liked
jimmy
so
i
do
in
his
place
but
that
place
is
the
husband
of
my
niece
aunt
polly
come
come
child
do
look
so
shocked
this
is
all
sheer
nonsense
and
i
glad
i
been
able
to
stop
it
before
it
gone
any
further
but
aunt
polly
it
has
gone
further
quavered
pollyanna
why
i
i
already
have
learned
to
lo
for
him
dearly
then
you
have
to
unlearn
it
pollyanna
for
never
never
will
i
give
my
consent
to
your
marrying
jimmy
bean
but
auntie
first
and
foremost
because
we
know
nothing
about
him
why
aunt
polly
we
always
known
him
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
yes
and
what
was
he
a
rough
little
runaway
urchin
from
an
home
we
know
nothing
whatever
about
his
people
and
his
pedigree
but
i
not
marrying
his
and
his
with
an
impatient
groan
aunt
polly
fell
back
on
her
pillow
pollyanna
you
making
me
positively
my
heart
is
going
like
a
trip
hammer
i
sleep
a
wink
ca
you
let
this
thing
rest
till
morning
pollyanna
was
on
her
feet
instantly
her
face
all
contrition
why
yes
yes
indeed
of
course
aunt
polly
and
feel
different
i
sure
i
sure
you
will
reiterated
the
girl
her
voice
quivering
with
hope
again
as
she
turned
to
extinguish
the
light
but
aunt
polly
did
not
feel
different
in
the
morning
if
anything
her
opposition
to
the
marriage
was
even
more
determined
in
vain
pollyanna
pleaded
and
argued
in
vain
she
showed
how
deeply
her
happiness
was
concerned
aunt
polly
was
obdurate
she
would
have
none
of
the
idea
she
sternly
admonished
pollyanna
as
to
the
possible
evils
of
heredity
and
warned
her
of
the
dangers
of
marrying
into
she
knew
not
what
sort
of
family
she
even
appealed
at
last
to
her
sense
of
duty
and
gratitude
toward
herself
and
reminded
pollyanna
of
the
long
years
of
loving
care
that
had
been
hers
in
the
home
of
her
aunt
and
she
begged
her
piteously
not
to
break
her
heart
by
this
marriage
as
had
her
mother
years
before
by
her
marriage
when
jimmy
himself
and
came
at
ten
he
was
met
by
a
frightened
little
pollyanna
that
tried
ineffectually
to
hold
him
back
with
two
trembling
hands
with
whitening
cheeks
but
with
defiantly
tender
arms
that
held
her
close
he
demanded
an
explanation
pollyanna
dearest
what
in
the
world
is
the
meaning
of
this
oh
jimmy
jimmy
why
did
you
come
why
did
you
come
i
was
going
to
write
and
tell
you
straight
away
moaned
pollyanna
but
you
did
write
me
dear
i
got
it
yesterday
afternoon
just
in
time
to
catch
my
train
no
no
again
i
mean
i
did
know
then
that
i
i
could
could
pollyanna
his
eyes
flamed
into
stern
wrath
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
anybody
else
love
you
think
you
got
to
keep
me
waiting
for
he
demanded
holding
her
at
arm
length
no
no
jimmy
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
ca
bear
it
then
what
is
it
what
is
it
you
ca
do
i
ca
marry
you
pollyanna
do
you
love
me
yes
oh
then
you
shall
marry
me
triumphed
jimmy
his
arms
enfolding
her
again
no
no
jimmy
you
do
understand
it
aunt
polly
struggled
pollyanna
aunt
polly
yes
she
wo
let
me
ho
jimmy
tossed
his
head
with
a
light
laugh
we
fix
aunt
polly
she
thinks
she
going
to
lose
you
but
we
just
remind
her
that
she
she
going
to
gain
a
a
new
nephew
he
finished
in
mock
importance
but
pollyanna
did
not
smile
she
turned
her
head
hopelessly
from
side
to
side
no
no
jimmy
you
do
understand
she
she
oh
how
can
i
tell
you
she
objects
to
to
you
for
me
jimmy
arms
relaxed
a
little
his
eyes
sobered
oh
well
i
suppose
i
ca
blame
her
for
that
i
no
wonder
of
course
he
admitted
constrainedly
still
he
turned
loving
eyes
upon
her
i
try
to
make
you
happy
dear
indeed
you
would
i
know
you
would
protested
pollyanna
tearfully
then
why
not
give
me
a
chance
to
try
pollyanna
even
if
she
does
quite
approve
at
first
maybe
in
time
after
we
were
married
we
could
win
her
over
oh
but
i
could
i
could
do
that
moaned
pollyanna
after
what
she
said
i
could
without
her
consent
you
see
she
done
so
much
for
me
and
she
so
dependent
on
me
she
is
well
a
bit
now
jimmy
and
really
lately
she
been
so
so
loving
and
been
trying
so
hard
to
to
play
the
game
you
know
in
spite
of
all
her
troubles
and
she
she
cried
jimmy
and
begged
me
not
to
break
her
heart
as
as
mother
did
long
ago
and
and
jimmy
i
i
just
could
after
all
she
done
for
me
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
with
a
vivid
red
mounting
to
her
forehead
pollyanna
spoke
again
brokenly
jimmy
if
you
if
you
could
only
tell
aunt
polly
something
about
about
your
father
and
your
people
and
jimmy
arms
dropped
suddenly
he
stepped
back
a
little
the
color
drained
from
his
face
is
that
it
he
asked
yes
pollyanna
came
nearer
and
touched
his
arm
timidly
think
it
is
for
me
jimmy
i
do
care
besides
i
know
that
your
father
and
your
people
were
all
all
fine
and
noble
because
you
are
so
fine
and
noble
but
she
jimmy
do
look
at
me
like
that
but
jimmy
with
a
low
moan
had
turned
quite
away
from
her
a
minute
later
with
only
a
few
choking
words
which
she
could
not
understand
he
had
left
the
house
from
the
harrington
homestead
jimmy
went
straight
home
and
sought
out
john
pendleton
he
found
him
in
the
great
library
where
some
years
before
pollyanna
had
looked
fearfully
about
for
the
skeleton
in
john
pendleton
closet
uncle
john
do
you
remember
that
packet
father
gave
me
demanded
jimmy
why
yes
what
the
matter
son
john
pendleton
had
given
a
start
of
surprise
at
sight
of
jimmy
face
that
packet
has
got
to
be
opened
sir
but
the
conditions
i
ca
help
it
it
got
to
be
that
all
will
you
do
it
why
my
boy
of
course
if
you
insist
but
he
paused
helplessly
uncle
john
as
perhaps
you
have
guessed
i
love
pollyanna
i
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
she
consented
the
elder
man
made
a
delighted
exclamation
but
the
other
did
not
pause
or
change
his
sternly
intent
expression
she
says
now
she
ca
marry
me
chilton
objects
she
objects
to
me
objects
to
you
john
pendleton
eyes
flashed
angrily
yes
i
found
out
why
when
when
pollyanna
begged
if
i
could
tell
her
aunt
something
about
about
my
father
and
my
people
shucks
i
thought
polly
chilton
had
more
sense
still
it
just
like
her
after
all
the
harringtons
have
always
been
inordinately
proud
of
race
and
family
snapped
john
pendleton
well
could
you
could
it
was
on
the
end
of
my
tongue
to
tell
pollyanna
that
there
could
have
been
a
better
father
than
mine
was
then
suddenly
i
remembered
the
packet
and
what
it
said
and
i
was
afraid
i
did
dare
say
a
word
till
i
knew
what
was
inside
that
packet
there
something
dad
did
want
me
to
know
till
i
was
thirty
years
old
when
i
would
be
a
man
grown
and
could
stand
anything
see
there
a
secret
somewhere
in
our
lives
i
got
to
know
that
secret
and
i
got
to
know
it
now
but
jimmy
lad
do
look
so
tragic
it
may
be
a
good
secret
perhaps
it
be
something
you
like
to
know
perhaps
but
if
it
had
been
would
he
have
been
apt
to
keep
it
from
me
till
i
was
thirty
years
old
no
uncle
john
it
was
something
he
was
trying
to
save
me
from
till
i
was
old
enough
to
stand
it
and
not
flinch
understand
i
not
blaming
dad
whatever
it
was
it
was
something
he
could
help
i
warrant
but
what
it
was
i
got
to
know
will
you
get
it
please
it
in
your
safe
you
know
john
pendleton
rose
at
once
i
get
it
he
said
three
minutes
later
it
lay
in
jimmy
hand
but
jimmy
held
it
out
at
once
i
would
rather
you
read
it
sir
please
then
tell
me
but
jimmy
i
very
well
with
a
decisive
gesture
john
pendleton
picked
up
a
opened
the
envelope
and
pulled
out
the
contents
there
was
a
package
of
several
papers
tied
together
and
one
folded
sheet
alone
apparently
a
letter
this
john
pendleton
opened
and
read
first
and
as
he
read
jimmy
tense
and
breathless
watched
his
face
he
saw
therefore
the
look
of
amazement
joy
and
something
else
he
could
not
name
that
leaped
into
john
pendleton
countenance
uncle
john
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
demanded
read
it
for
yourself
answered
the
man
thrusting
the
letter
into
jimmy
outstretched
hand
and
jimmy
read
this
the
enclosed
papers
are
the
legal
proof
that
my
boy
jimmy
is
really
james
kent
son
of
john
kent
who
married
doris
wetherby
daughter
of
william
wetherby
of
boston
there
is
also
a
letter
in
which
i
explain
to
my
boy
why
i
have
kept
him
from
his
mother
family
all
these
years
if
this
packet
is
opened
by
him
at
thirty
years
of
age
he
will
read
this
letter
and
i
hope
will
forgive
a
father
who
feared
to
lose
his
boy
entirely
so
took
this
drastic
course
to
keep
him
to
himself
if
it
is
opened
by
strangers
because
of
his
death
i
request
that
his
mother
people
in
boston
be
notified
at
once
and
the
inclosed
package
of
papers
be
given
intact
into
their
hands
john
kent
jimmy
was
pale
and
shaken
when
he
looked
up
to
meet
john
eyes
am
i
the
lost
jamie
he
faltered
that
letter
says
you
have
documents
there
to
prove
it
nodded
the
other
carew
nephew
of
course
but
why
what
i
ca
realize
it
there
was
a
moment
pause
before
into
jimmy
face
flashed
a
new
joy
then
surely
now
i
know
who
i
am
i
can
tell
chilton
something
of
my
people
i
should
say
you
could
retorted
john
pendleton
dryly
the
boston
wetherbys
can
trace
straight
back
to
the
crusades
and
i
do
know
but
to
the
year
one
that
ought
to
satisfy
her
as
for
your
father
he
came
of
good
stock
too
carew
told
me
though
he
was
rather
eccentric
and
not
pleasing
to
the
family
as
you
know
of
course
yes
poor
dad
and
what
a
life
he
must
have
lived
with
me
all
those
years
always
dreading
pursuit
i
can
understand
lots
of
things
now
that
used
to
puzzle
me
a
woman
called
me
once
jove
how
angry
he
was
i
know
now
why
he
hurried
me
away
that
night
without
even
waiting
for
supper
poor
dad
it
was
right
after
that
he
was
taken
sick
he
could
use
his
hands
or
his
feet
and
very
soon
he
could
talk
straight
something
ailed
his
speech
i
remember
when
he
died
he
was
trying
to
tell
me
something
about
this
packet
i
believe
now
he
was
telling
me
to
open
it
and
go
to
my
mother
people
but
i
thought
then
he
was
just
telling
me
to
keep
it
safe
so
that
what
i
promised
him
but
it
did
comfort
him
any
it
only
seemed
to
worry
him
more
you
see
i
did
understand
poor
dad
suppose
we
take
a
look
at
these
papers
suggested
john
pendleton
besides
there
a
letter
from
your
father
to
you
i
understand
do
you
want
to
read
it
yes
of
course
and
then
the
young
fellow
laughed
shamefacedly
and
glanced
at
the
clock
i
was
wondering
just
how
soon
i
could
go
back
to
pollyanna
a
thoughtful
frown
came
to
john
pendleton
face
he
glanced
at
jimmy
hesitated
then
spoke
i
know
you
want
to
see
pollyanna
lad
and
i
do
blame
you
but
it
strikes
me
that
under
the
circumstances
you
should
go
first
to
carew
and
take
these
he
tapped
the
papers
before
him
jimmy
drew
his
brows
together
and
pondered
all
right
sir
i
will
he
agreed
resignedly
and
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
go
with
you
further
suggested
john
pendleton
a
little
diffidently
i
i
have
a
little
matter
of
my
own
that
i
like
to
see
your
aunt
about
suppose
we
go
down
today
on
the
three
good
we
will
sir
gorry
and
so
i
jamie
i
ca
grasp
it
yet
exclaimed
the
young
man
springing
to
his
feet
and
restlessly
moving
about
the
room
i
wonder
now
he
stopped
and
colored
boyishly
do
you
think
aunt
ruth
will
mind
very
much
john
pendleton
shook
his
head
a
hint
of
the
old
somberness
came
into
his
eyes
hardly
my
boy
but
i
thinking
of
myself
how
about
it
when
you
her
boy
where
am
i
coming
in
you
do
you
think
anything
could
put
you
one
side
scoffed
jimmy
fervently
you
need
worry
about
that
and
she
wo
mind
she
has
jamie
you
know
and
he
stopped
short
a
dawning
dismay
in
his
eyes
by
george
uncle
john
i
forgot
jamie
this
is
going
to
be
tough
on
jamie
yes
i
thought
of
that
still
he
legally
adopted
is
he
oh
yes
it
is
that
it
the
fact
that
he
is
the
real
jamie
himself
and
he
with
his
two
poor
useless
legs
why
uncle
john
just
about
kill
him
i
heard
him
talk
i
know
besides
pollyanna
and
carew
both
have
told
me
how
he
feels
how
sure
he
is
and
how
happy
he
is
great
scott
i
ca
take
away
from
him
this
but
what
can
i
do
i
do
know
my
boy
i
do
see
as
there
anything
you
can
do
but
what
you
are
doing
there
was
a
long
silence
jimmy
had
resumed
his
nervous
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
suddenly
he
wheeled
his
face
alight
there
is
a
way
and
i
do
it
i
know
carew
will
agree
we
wo
tell
we
wo
tell
anybody
but
carew
herself
and
and
pollyanna
and
her
aunt
i
have
to
tell
them
he
added
defensively
you
certainly
will
my
boy
as
for
the
rest
john
pendleton
paused
doubtfully
it
nobody
business
but
remember
you
are
making
quite
a
sacrifice
in
several
ways
i
want
you
to
weigh
it
well
weigh
it
i
have
weighed
it
and
there
nothing
in
it
with
jamie
on
the
other
side
of
the
scales
sir
i
just
could
do
it
that
all
i
do
blame
you
and
i
think
you
right
declared
john
pendleton
heartily
furthermore
i
believe
carew
will
agree
with
you
particularly
as
she
know
now
that
the
real
jamie
is
found
at
last
you
know
she
always
said
she
seen
me
somewhere
chuckled
jimmy
now
how
soon
does
that
train
go
i
ready
well
i
not
laughed
john
pendleton
luckily
for
me
it
does
go
for
some
hours
yet
anyhow
he
finished
as
he
got
to
his
feet
and
left
the
room
chapter
xxxii
a
new
aladdin
whatever
were
john
pendleton
preparations
for
departure
and
they
were
both
varied
and
hurried
they
were
done
in
the
open
with
two
exceptions
the
exceptions
were
two
letters
one
addressed
to
pollyanna
and
one
to
polly
chilton
these
letters
together
with
careful
and
minute
instructions
were
given
into
the
hands
of
susan
his
housekeeper
to
be
delivered
after
they
should
be
gone
but
of
all
this
jimmy
knew
nothing
the
travelers
were
nearing
boston
when
john
pendleton
said
to
jimmy
my
boy
i
got
one
favor
to
ask
or
rather
two
the
first
is
that
we
say
nothing
to
carew
until
afternoon
the
other
is
that
you
allow
me
to
go
first
and
be
your
er
ambassador
you
yourself
not
appearing
on
the
scene
until
perhaps
say
four
are
you
willing
indeed
i
am
replied
jimmy
promptly
not
only
willing
but
delighted
i
been
wondering
how
i
was
going
to
break
the
ice
and
i
glad
to
have
somebody
else
do
it
good
then
i
try
to
get
your
aunt
on
the
telephone
morning
and
make
my
appointment
true
to
his
promise
jimmy
did
not
appear
at
the
carew
mansion
until
four
the
next
afternoon
even
then
he
felt
suddenly
so
embarrassed
that
he
walked
twice
by
the
house
before
he
summoned
sufficient
courage
to
go
up
the
steps
and
ring
the
bell
once
in
carew
presence
however
he
was
soon
his
natural
self
so
quickly
did
she
set
him
at
his
ease
and
so
tactfully
did
she
handle
the
situation
to
be
sure
at
the
very
first
there
were
a
few
tears
and
a
few
incoherent
exclamations
even
john
pendleton
had
to
reach
a
hasty
hand
for
his
handkerchief
but
before
very
long
a
semblance
of
normal
tranquillity
was
restored
and
only
the
tender
glow
in
carew
eyes
and
the
ecstatic
happiness
in
jimmy
and
john
pendleton
was
left
to
mark
the
occasion
as
something
out
of
the
ordinary
and
i
think
it
so
fine
of
you
about
jamie
exclaimed
carew
after
a
little
indeed
jimmy
i
shall
still
call
you
jimmy
for
obvious
reasons
besides
i
like
it
better
for
you
indeed
i
think
you
just
right
if
you
willing
to
do
it
and
i
making
some
sacrifice
myself
too
she
went
on
tearfully
for
i
should
be
so
proud
to
introduce
you
to
the
world
as
my
nephew
and
indeed
aunt
ruth
i
at
a
exclamation
from
john
pendleton
jimmy
stopped
short
he
saw
then
that
jamie
and
sadie
dean
stood
just
inside
the
door
jamie
face
was
very
white
aunt
ruth
he
exclaimed
looking
from
one
to
the
other
with
startled
eyes
aunt
ruth
you
do
mean
all
the
blood
receded
from
carew
face
and
from
jimmy
too
john
pendleton
however
advanced
jauntily
yes
jamie
why
not
i
was
going
to
tell
you
soon
anyway
so
tell
you
now
jimmy
gasped
and
stepped
hastily
forward
but
john
pendleton
silenced
him
with
a
look
just
a
little
while
ago
carew
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
by
saying
yes
to
a
certain
question
i
asked
now
as
jimmy
calls
me
john
why
should
he
begin
right
away
to
call
carew
ruth
oh
exclaimed
jamie
in
plain
delight
while
jimmy
under
john
pendleton
steady
gaze
just
managed
to
save
the
situation
by
not
blurting
out
his
surprise
and
pleasure
naturally
too
just
then
blushing
carew
became
the
center
of
every
one
interest
and
the
danger
point
was
passed
only
jimmy
heard
john
pendleton
say
low
in
his
ear
a
bit
later
so
you
see
you
young
rascal
i
not
going
to
lose
you
after
all
we
shall
both
have
you
now
exclamations
and
congratulations
were
still
at
their
height
when
jamie
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
turned
without
warning
to
sadie
dean
sadie
i
going
to
tell
them
now
he
declared
triumphantly
then
with
the
bright
color
in
sadie
face
telling
the
tender
story
even
before
jamie
eager
lips
could
frame
the
words
more
congratulations
and
exclamations
were
in
order
and
everybody
was
laughing
and
shaking
hands
with
everybody
else
jimmy
however
very
soon
began
to
eye
them
all
aggrievedly
longingly
this
is
all
very
well
for
you
he
complained
then
you
each
have
each
other
but
where
do
i
come
in
i
can
just
tell
you
though
that
if
only
a
certain
young
lady
i
know
were
here
should
have
something
to
tell
you
perhaps
just
a
minute
jimmy
interposed
john
pendleton
let
play
i
was
aladdin
and
let
me
rub
the
lamp
carew
have
i
your
permission
to
ring
for
mary
why
certainly
murmured
that
lady
in
a
puzzled
surprise
that
found
its
duplicate
on
the
faces
of
the
others
a
few
moments
later
mary
stood
in
the
doorway
did
i
hear
miss
pollyanna
come
in
a
short
time
ago
asked
john
pendleton
yes
sir
she
is
here
wo
you
ask
her
to
come
down
please
pollyanna
here
exclaimed
an
amazed
chorus
as
mary
disappeared
jimmy
turned
very
white
then
very
red
yes
i
sent
a
note
to
her
yesterday
by
my
housekeeper
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
her
down
for
a
few
days
to
see
you
carew
i
thought
the
little
girl
needed
a
rest
and
a
holiday
and
my
housekeeper
has
instructions
to
remain
and
care
for
chilton
i
also
wrote
a
note
to
chilton
herself
he
added
turning
suddenly
to
jimmy
with
unmistakable
meaning
in
his
eyes
and
i
thought
after
she
read
what
i
said
that
she
let
pollyanna
come
it
seems
she
did
for
here
she
is
and
there
she
was
in
the
doorway
blushing
yet
withal
just
a
bit
shy
and
questioning
pollyanna
dearest
it
was
jimmy
who
sprang
forward
to
meet
her
and
who
without
one
minute
hesitation
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
oh
jimmy
before
all
these
people
breathed
pollyanna
in
embarrassed
protest
pooh
i
should
have
kissed
you
then
pollyanna
if
you
been
straight
in
the
middle
of
of
washington
street
itself
vowed
jimmy
for
that
matter
look
at
these
people
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
need
to
worry
about
them
and
pollyanna
looked
and
she
saw
over
by
one
window
backs
carefully
turned
jamie
and
sadie
dean
over
by
another
window
backs
also
carefully
turned
carew
and
john
pendleton
pollyanna
smiled
so
adorably
that
jimmy
kissed
her
again
oh
jimmy
is
it
all
beautiful
and
wonderful
she
murmured
softly
and
aunt
polly
she
knows
everything
now
and
it
all
right
i
think
it
would
have
been
all
right
anyway
she
was
beginning
to
feel
so
bad
for
me
now
she
so
glad
and
i
am
too
why
jimmy
glad
glad
for
everything
now
illustration
glad
glad
for
everything
now
jimmy
caught
his
breath
with
a
joy
that
hurt
god
grant
little
girl
that
always
it
may
be
so
with
you
he
choked
unsteadily
his
arms
holding
her
close
i
sure
it
will
sighed
pollyanna
with
shining
eyes
of
confidence
the
end
