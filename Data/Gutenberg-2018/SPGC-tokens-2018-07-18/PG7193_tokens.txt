c
e
most
of
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
book
really
occurred
one
or
two
were
experiences
of
my
own
the
rest
those
of
boys
who
were
schoolmates
of
mine
huck
finn
is
drawn
from
life
tom
sawyer
also
but
not
from
an
individual
he
is
a
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
three
boys
whom
i
knew
and
therefore
belongs
to
the
composite
order
of
architecture
the
odd
superstitions
touched
upon
were
all
prevalent
among
children
and
slaves
in
the
west
at
the
period
of
this
story
that
is
to
say
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
although
my
book
is
intended
mainly
for
the
entertainment
of
boys
and
girls
i
hope
it
will
not
be
shunned
by
men
and
women
on
that
account
for
part
of
my
plan
has
been
to
try
to
pleasantly
remind
adults
of
what
they
once
were
themselves
and
of
how
they
felt
and
thought
and
talked
and
what
queer
enterprises
they
sometimes
engaged

tom
no

tom
no

what
gone
with
that
boy
i
wonder
you
tom
no
answer
the
old
lady
pulled
her
spectacles
down
and
looked
over
them
about
the
room
then
she
put
them
up
and
looked
out
under
them
she
seldom
or
never
looked
through
them
for
so
small
a
thing
as
a
boy
they
were
her
state
pair
the
pride
of
her
heart
and
were
built
for
style
not
service
she
could
have
seen
through
a
pair
of
just
as
well
she
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
not
fiercely
but
still
loud
enough
for
the
furniture
to
hear
well
i
lay
if
i
get
hold
of
you
i
she
did
not
finish
for
by
this
time
she
was
bending
down
and
punching
under
the
bed
with
the
broom
and
so
she
needed
breath
to
punctuate
the
punches
with
she
resurrected
nothing
but
the
cat
i
never
did
see
the
beat
of
that
boy
she
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
in
it
and
looked
out
among
the
tomato
vines
and
jimpson
weeds
that
constituted
the
garden
no
tom
so
she
lifted
up
her
voice
at
an
angle
calculated
for
distance
and
shouted
tom
there
was
a
slight
noise
behind
her
and
she
turned
just
in
time
to
seize
a
small
boy
by
the
slack
of
his
roundabout
and
arrest
his
flight
there
i
might
thought
of
that
closet
what
you
been
doing
in
there
nothing
nothing
look
at
your
hands
and
look
at
your
mouth
what
is
that
truck
i
do
know
aunt
well
i
know
it
jam
that
what
it
is
forty
times
i
said
if
you
did
let
that
jam
alone
i
skin
you
hand
me
that
switch
the
switch
hovered
in
the
air
the
peril
was
desperate
my
look
behind
you
aunt
the
old
lady
whirled
round
and
snatched
her
skirts
out
of
danger
the
lad
fled
on
the
instant
scrambled
up
the
high
and
disappeared
over
it
his
aunt
polly
stood
surprised
a
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
gentle
laugh
hang
the
boy
ca
i
never
learn
anything
ai
he
played
me
tricks
enough
like
that
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
by
this
time
but
old
fools
is
the
biggest
fools
there
is
ca
learn
an
old
dog
new
tricks
as
the
saying
is
but
my
goodness
he
never
plays
them
alike
two
days
and
how
is
a
body
to
know
what
coming
he
to
know
just
how
long
he
can
torment
me
before
i
get
my
dander
up
and
he
knows
if
he
can
make
out
to
put
me
off
for
a
minute
or
make
me
laugh
it
all
down
again
and
i
ca
hit
him
a
lick
i
ai
doing
my
duty
by
that
boy
and
that
the
lord

goodness
knows

the
rod
and
spile

child

the
good
book

a
laying
up

of
the
old
scratch
but

own
dead
sister
boy

thing
and
i
ai
got
the
heart
to
lash
him
somehow
every
time
i
let
him
off
my
conscience
does
hurt
me
so
and
every
time
i
hit
him
my
old
heart
most
breaks
man
that
is
born
of
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
as
the
scripture
says
and
i
reckon
it
so
he
play
hookey
this
evening
and
southwestern
for
afternoon
i
just
be
obleeged
to
make
him
work
to
punish
him
it
mighty
hard
to
make
him
work
saturdays
when
all
the
boys
is
having
holiday
but
he
hates
work
more
than
he
hates
anything
else
and
i
got
to
do
some
of
my
duty
by
him
or
i
be
the
ruination
of
the
child
tom
did
play
hookey
and
he
had
a
very
good
time
he
got
back
home
barely
in
season
to
help
jim
the
small
colored
boy
saw
wood
and
split
the
kindlings
before
supper
at
least
he
was
there
in
time
to
tell
his
adventures
to
jim
while
jim
did
of
the
work
tom
younger
brother
or
rather
sid
was
already
through
with
his
part
of
the
work
picking
up
chips
for
he
was
a
quiet
boy
and
had
no
adventurous
troublesome
ways
while
tom
was
eating
his
supper
and
stealing
sugar
as
opportunity
offered
aunt
polly
asked
him
questions
that
were
full
of
guile
and
very
deep
for
she
wanted
to
trap
him
into
damaging
revealments
like
many
other
souls
it
was
her
pet
vanity
to
believe
she
was
endowed
with
a
talent
for
dark
and
mysterious
diplomacy
and
she
loved
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent
devices
as
marvels
of
low
cunning
said
she
tom
it
was
middling
warm
in
school
war
it
yes
powerful
warm
war
it
yes
did
you
want
to
go
in
tom
a
bit
of
a
scare
shot
through
tom
a
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
he
searched
aunt
polly
face
but
it
told
him
nothing
so
he
said
no
well
not
very
much
the
old
lady
reached
out
her
hand
and
felt
tom
shirt
and
said
but
you
ai
too
warm
now
though
and
it
flattered
her
to
reflect
that
she
had
discovered
that
the
shirt
was
dry
without
anybody
knowing
that
that
was
what
she
had
in
her
mind
but
in
spite
of
her
tom
knew
where
the
wind
lay
now
so
he
forestalled
what
might
be
the
next
move
some
of
us
pumped
on
our
heads
mine
damp
yet
see
aunt
polly
was
vexed
to
think
she
had
overlooked
that
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
missed
a
trick
then
she
had
a
new
inspiration
tom
you
did
have
to
undo
your
shirt
collar
where
i
sewed
it
to
pump
on
your
head
did
you
unbutton
your
jacket
the
trouble
vanished
out
of
tom
face
he
opened
his
jacket
his
shirt
collar
was
securely
sewed
bother
well
go
with
you
i
made
sure
you
played
hookey
and
been
but
i
forgive
ye
tom
i
reckon
you
a
kind
of
a
singed
cat
as
the
saying
is
you
look
this
time
she
was
half
sorry
her
sagacity
had
miscarried
and
half
glad
that
tom
had
stumbled
into
obedient
conduct
for
once
but
sidney
said
well
now
if
i
did
think
you
sewed
his
collar
with
white
thread
but
it
black
why
i
did
sew
it
with
white
tom
but
tom
did
not
wait
for
the
rest
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
said
siddy
i
lick
you
for
that
in
a
safe
place
tom
examined
two
large
needles
which
were
thrust
into
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
and
had
thread
bound
about
them
one
needle
carried
white
thread
and
the
other
black
he
said
she
never
noticed
if
it
had
been
for
sid
confound
it
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
white
and
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
black
i
wish
to
geeminy
she
stick
to
one
or
i
ca
keep
the
run
of
but
i
bet
you
i
lam
sid
for
that
i
learn
him
he
was
not
the
model
boy
of
the
village
he
knew
the
model
boy
very
well
though
and
loathed
him
within
two
minutes
or
even
less
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles
not
because
his
troubles
were
one
whit
less
heavy
and
bitter
to
him
than
a
man
are
to
a
man
but
because
a
new
and
powerful
interest
bore
them
down
and
drove
them
out
of
his
mind
for
the
time
just
as
misfortunes
are
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
new
enterprises
this
new
interest
was
a
valued
novelty
in
whistling
which
he
had
just
acquired
from
a
negro
and
he
was
suffering
to
practise
it
undisturbed
it
consisted
in
a
peculiar
turn
a
sort
of
liquid
warble
produced
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
at
short
intervals
in
the
midst
of
the
music
the
reader
probably
remembers
how
to
do
it
if
he
has
ever
been
a
boy
diligence
and
attention
soon
gave
him
the
knack
of
it
and
he
strode
down
the
street
with
his
mouth
full
of
harmony
and
his
soul
full
of
gratitude
he
felt
much
as
an
astronomer
feels
who
has
discovered
a
new
planet
no
doubt
as
far
as
strong
deep
unalloyed
pleasure
is
concerned
the
advantage
was
with
the
boy
not
the
astronomer
the
summer
evenings
were
long
it
was
not
dark
yet
presently
tom
checked
his
whistle
a
stranger
was
before
him
a
boy
a
shade
larger
than
himself
a
of
any
age
or
either
sex
was
an
impressive
curiosity
in
the
poor
little
shabby
village
of
petersburg
this
boy
was
well
dressed
too
well
dressed
on
a
this
was
simply
astounding
his
cap
was
a
dainty
thing
his
blue
cloth
roundabout
was
new
and
natty
and
so
were
his
pantaloons
he
had
shoes
on
and
it
was
only
friday
he
even
wore
a
necktie
a
bright
bit
of
ribbon
he
had
a
citified
air
about
him
that
ate
into
tom
vitals
the
more
tom
stared
at
the
splendid
marvel
the
higher
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
his
finery
and
the
shabbier
and
shabbier
his
own
outfit
seemed
to
him
to
grow
neither
boy
spoke
if
one
moved
the
other
moved
but
only
sidewise
in
a
circle
they
kept
face
to
face
and
eye
to
eye
all
the
time
finally
tom
said
i
can
lick
you
i
like
to
see
you
try
it
well
i
can
do
it
no
you
ca
either
yes

can
no

i
can

an
uncomfortable
pause
then
tom
said

i
make
it
my
business

why

one
hand
tied
behind
me
if
i

you
do
it

because
you
afraid
i
ai
afraid
you
are
i
ai
you
are
another
pause
and
more
eying
and
sidling
around
each
other
presently
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
tom
said
get
away
from
here
go
away
yourself
i
wo
i
wo
either
so
they
stood
each
with
a
foot
placed
at
an
angle
as
a
brace
and
both
shoving
with
might
and
main
and
glowering
at
each
other
with
hate
but
neither
could
get
an
advantage
after
struggling
till
both
were
hot
and
flushed
each
relaxed
his
strain
with
watchful
caution
and
tom
said
you
a
coward
and
a
pup
i
tell
my
big
brother
on
you
and
he
can
thrash
you
with
his
little
finger
and
i
make
him
do
it
too
what
do
i
care
for
your
big
brother
i
got
a
brother
that
bigger
than
he
is
and
what
more
he
can
throw
him
over
that
fence
too
both
brothers
were
imaginary
that
a
lie
your
saying
so
do
make
it
so
tom
drew
a
line
in
the
dust
with
his
big
toe
and
said
i
dare
you
to
step
over
that
and
i
lick
you
till
you
ca
stand
up
anybody
that
take
a
dare
will
steal
sheep
the
new
boy
stepped
over
promptly
and
said
now
you
said
you
do
it
now
let
see
you
do
it
do
you
crowd
me
now
you
better
look
out
well
you
said
you
do
it
why
do
you
do
it
by
jingo
for
two
cents
i
will
do
it
the
new
boy
took
two
broad
coppers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
them
out
with
derision
tom
struck
them
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
both
boys
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
dirt
gripped
together
like
cats
and
for
the
space
of
a
minute
they
tugged
and
tore
at
each
other
hair
and
clothes
punched
and
scratched
each
other
nose
and
covered
themselves
with
dust
and
glory
presently
the
confusion
took
form
and
through
the
fog
of
battle
tom
appeared
seated
astride
the
new
boy
and
pounding
him
with
his
fists
holler
said
he
the
boy
only
struggled
to
free
himself
he
was
crying
mainly
from
rage
holler
and
the
pounding
went
on
at
last
the
stranger
got
out
a
smothered
and
tom
let
him
up
and
said
now
that
learn
you
better
look
out
who
you
fooling
with
next
time
the
new
boy
went
off
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
sobbing
snuffling
and
occasionally
looking
back
and
shaking
his
head
and
threatening
what
he
would
do
to
tom
the
next
time
he
caught
him
out
to
which
tom
responded
with
jeers
and
started
off
in
high
feather
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
the
new
boy
snatched
up
a
stone
threw
it
and
hit
him
between
the
shoulders
and
then
turned
tail
and
ran
like
an
antelope
tom
chased
the
traitor
home
and
thus
found
out
where
he
lived
he
then
held
a
position
at
the
gate
for
some
time
daring
the
enemy
to
come
outside
but
the
enemy
only
made
faces
at
him
through
the
window
and
declined
at
last
the
enemy
mother
appeared
and
called
tom
a
bad
vicious
vulgar
child
and
ordered
him
away
so
he
went
away
but
he
said
he
to
lay
for
that
boy
he
got
home
pretty
late
that
night
and
when
he
climbed
cautiously
in
at
the
window
he
uncovered
an
ambuscade
in
the
person
of
his
aunt
and
when
she
saw
the
state
his
clothes
were
in
her
resolution
to
turn
his
saturday
holiday
into
captivity
at
hard
labor
became
adamantine
in
its
firmness
chapter
ii
saturday
morning
was
come
and
all
the
summer
world
was
bright
and
fresh
and
brimming
with
life
there
was
a
song
in
every
heart
and
if
the
heart
was
young
the
music
issued
at
the
lips
there
was
cheer
in
every
face
and
a
spring
in
every
step
the
were
in
bloom
and
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
filled
the
air
cardiff
hill
beyond
the
village
and
above
it
was
green
with
vegetation
and
it
lay
just
far
enough
away
to
seem
a
delectable
land
dreamy
reposeful
and
inviting
tom
appeared
on
the
sidewalk
with
a
bucket
of
whitewash
and
a
brush
he
surveyed
the
fence
and
all
gladness
left
him
and
a
deep
melancholy
settled
down
upon
his
spirit
thirty
yards
of
board
fence
nine
feet
high
life
to
him
seemed
hollow
and
existence
but
a
burden
sighing
he
dipped
his
brush
and
passed
it
along
the
topmost
plank
repeated
the
operation
did
it
again
compared
the
insignificant
whitewashed
streak
with
the
continent
of
unwhitewashed
fence
and
sat
down
on
a
discouraged
jim
came
skipping
out
at
the
gate
with
a
tin
pail
and
singing
buffalo
gals
bringing
water
from
the
town
pump
had
always
been
hateful
work
in
tom
eyes
before
but
now
it
did
not
strike
him
so
he
remembered
that
there
was
company
at
the
pump
white
mulatto
and
negro
boys
and
girls
were
always
there
waiting
their
turns
resting
trading
playthings
quarrelling
fighting
skylarking
and
he
remembered
that
although
the
pump
was
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
off
jim
never
got
back
with
a
bucket
of
water
under
an
hour
and
even
then
somebody
generally
had
to
go
after
him

besides
if

i

my
sore

jim
was
only
human
this
attraction
was
too
much
for
him
he
put
down
his
pail
took
the
white
alley
and
bent
over
the
toe
with
absorbing
interest
while
the
bandage
was
being
unwound
in
another
moment
he
was
flying
down
the
street
with
his
pail
and
a
tingling
rear
tom
was
whitewashing
with
vigor
and
aunt
polly
was
retiring
from
the
field
with
a
slipper
in
her
hand
and
triumph
in
her
eye
but
tom
energy
did
not
last
he
began
to
think
of
the
fun
he
had
planned
for
this
day
and
his
sorrows
multiplied
soon
the
free
boys
would
come
tripping
along
on
all
sorts
of
delicious
expeditions
and
they
would
make
a
world
of
fun
of
him
for
having
to
work
the
very
thought
of
it
burnt
him
like
fire
he
got
out
his
worldly
wealth
and
examined
it
bits
of
toys
marbles
and
trash
enough
to
buy
an
exchange
of
work
maybe
but
not
half
enough
to
buy
so
much
as
half
an
hour
of
pure
freedom
so
he
returned
his
straitened
means
to
his
pocket
and
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
buy
the
boys
at
this
dark
and
hopeless
moment
an
inspiration
burst
upon
him
nothing
less
than
a
great
magnificent
inspiration
he
took
up
his
brush
and
went
tranquilly
to
work
ben
rogers
hove
in
sight
presently
the
very
boy
of
all
boys
whose
ridicule
he
had
been
dreading
ben
gait
was
the
proof
enough
that
his
heart
was
light
and
his
anticipations
high
he
was
eating
an
apple
and
giving
a
long
melodious
whoop
at
intervals
followed
by
a
for
he
was
personating
a
steamboat
as
he
drew
near
he
slackened
speed
took
the
middle
of
the
street
leaned
far
over
to
starboard
and
rounded
to
ponderously
and
with
laborious
pomp
and
circumstance
for
he
was
personating
the
big
missouri
and
considered
himself
to
be
drawing
nine
feet
of
water
he
was
boat
and
captain
and
combined
so
he
had
to
imagine
himself
standing
on
his
own
giving
the
orders
and
executing
them
stop
her
sir
the
headway
ran
almost
out
and
he
drew
up
slowly
toward
the
sidewalk
ship
up
to
back
his
arms
straightened
and
stiffened
down
his
sides
set
her
back
on
the
stabboard
chow
chow
his
right
hand
meantime
describing
stately
circles
for
it
was
representing
a
wheel
let
her
go
back
on
the
labboard
the
left
hand
began
to
describe
circles
stop
the
stabboard
stop
the
labboard
come
ahead
on
the
stabboard
stop
her
let
your
outside
turn
over
slow
get
out
that
lively
now
come
out
with
your
what
you
about
there
take
a
turn
round
that
stump
with
the
bight
of
it
stand
by
that
stage
now
let
her
go
done
with
the
engines
sir
trying
the
tom
went
on
whitewashing
paid
no
attention
to
the
steamboat
ben
stared
a
moment
and
then
said
you
up
a
stump
ai
you
no
answer
tom
surveyed
his
last
touch
with
the
eye
of
an
artist
then
he
gave
his
brush
another
gentle
sweep
and
surveyed
the
result
as
before
ben
ranged
up
alongside
of
him
tom
mouth
watered
for
the
apple
but
he
stuck
to
his
work
ben
said
hello
old
chap
you
got
to
work
hey
tom
wheeled
suddenly
and
said
why
it
you
ben
i
war
noticing
say
i
going
in
i
am
do
you
wish
you
could
but
of
course
you
druther
work
would
you
course
you
would
tom
contemplated
the
boy
a
bit
and
said
what
do
you
call
work
why
ai
that
work
tom
resumed
his
whitewashing
and
answered
carelessly
well
maybe
it
is
and
maybe
it
ai
all
i
know
is
it
suits
tom
sawyer
oh
come
now
you
do
mean
to
let
on
that
you
like
it
the
brush
continued
to
move
like
it
well
i
do
see
why
i
ought
to
like
it
does
a
boy
get
a
chance
to
whitewash
a
fence
every
day
that
put
the
thing
in
a
new
light
ben
stopped
nibbling
his
apple
tom
swept
his
brush
daintily
back
and
forth
stepped
back
to
note
the
effect
added
a
touch
here
and
there
criticised
the
effect
again
ben
watching
every
move
and
getting
more
and
more
interested
more
and
more
absorbed
presently
he
said
say
tom
let
me
whitewash
a
little
tom
considered
was
about
to
consent
but
he
altered
his
mind
no
no
i
reckon
it
would
hardly
do
ben
you
see
aunt
awful
particular
about
this
fence
right
here
on
the
street
you
know
but
if
it
was
the
back
fence
i
would
mind
and
she
would
yes
she
awful
particular
about
this
fence
it
got
to
be
done
very
careful
i
reckon
there
ai
one
boy
in
a
thousand
maybe
two
thousand
that
can
do
it
the
way
it
got
to
be
done
no
is
that
so
oh
come
now
lem
me
just
try
only
just
a
little
let
you
if
you
was
me
tom
ben
i
like
to
honest
injun
but
aunt
polly
well
jim
wanted
to
do
it
but
she
would
let
him
sid
wanted
to
do
it
and
she
let
sid
now
do
you
see
how
i
fixed
if
you
was
to
tackle
this
fence
and
anything
was
to
happen
to
it
oh
shucks
i
be
just
as
careful
now
lem
me
try
say
i
give
you
the
core
of
my
apple
well
here
no
ben
now
do
i
afeard
i
give
you
all
of
it
tom
gave
up
the
brush
with
reluctance
in
his
face
but
alacrity
in
his
heart
and
while
the
late
steamer
big
missouri
worked
and
sweated
in
the
sun
the
retired
artist
sat
on
a
barrel
in
the
shade
close
by
dangled
his
legs
munched
his
apple
and
planned
the
slaughter
of
more
innocents
there
was
no
lack
of
material
boys
happened
along
every
little
while
they
came
to
jeer
but
remained
to
whitewash
by
the
time
ben
was
fagged
out
tom
had
traded
the
next
chance
to
billy
fisher
for
a
kite
in
good
repair
and
when
he
played
out
johnny
miller
bought
in
for
a
dead
rat
and
a
string
to
swing
it
with
and
so
on
and
so
on
hour
after
hour
and
when
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
came
from
being
a
poor
boy
in
the
morning
tom
was
literally
rolling
in
wealth
he
had
besides
the
things
before
mentioned
twelve
marbles
part
of
a
a
piece
of
blue
to
look
through
a
spool
cannon
a
key
that
would
unlock
anything
a
fragment
of
chalk
a
glass
stopper
of
a
decanter
a
tin
soldier
a
couple
of
tadpoles
six
a
kitten
with
only
one
eye
a
brass
doorknob
a
but
no
dog
the
handle
of
a
knife
four
pieces
of
and
a
dilapidated
old
window
sash
he
had
had
a
nice
good
idle
time
all
the
while
plenty
of
company
and
the
fence
had
three
coats
of
whitewash
on
it
if
he
had
run
out
of
whitewash
he
would
have
bankrupted
every
boy
in
the
village
tom
said
to
himself
that
it
was
not
such
a
hollow
world
after
all
he
had
discovered
a
great
law
of
human
action
without
knowing
it
namely
that
in
order
to
make
a
man
or
a
boy
covet
a
thing
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
the
thing
difficult
to
attain
if
he
had
been
a
great
and
wise
philosopher
like
the
writer
of
this
book
he
would
now
have
comprehended
that
work
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
obliged
to
do
and
that
play
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
not
obliged
to
do
and
this
would
help
him
to
understand
why
constructing
artificial
flowers
or
performing
on
a
is
work
while
rolling
or
climbing
mont
blanc
is
only
amusement
there
are
wealthy
gentlemen
in
england
who
drive
twenty
or
thirty
miles
on
a
daily
line
in
the
summer
because
the
privilege
costs
them
considerable
money
but
if
they
were
offered
wages
for
the
service
that
would
turn
it
into
work
and
then
they
would
resign
the
boy
mused
awhile
over
the
substantial
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
worldly
circumstances
and
then
wended
toward
headquarters
to
report
chapter
iii
tom
presented
himself
before
aunt
polly
who
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
in
a
pleasant
rearward
apartment
which
was
bedroom
and
library
combined
the
balmy
summer
air
the
restful
quiet
the
odor
of
the
flowers
and
the
drowsing
murmur
of
the
bees
had
had
their
effect
and
she
was
nodding
over
her
knitting
for
she
had
no
company
but
the
cat
and
it
was
asleep
in
her
lap
her
spectacles
were
propped
up
on
her
gray
head
for
safety
she
had
thought
that
of
course
tom
had
deserted
long
ago
and
she
wondered
at
seeing
him
place
himself
in
her
power
again
in
this
intrepid
way
he
said
i
go
and
play
now
aunt
what
how
much
have
you
done
it
all
done
aunt
tom
do
lie
to
me
i
ca
bear
it
i
ai
aunt
it
is
all
done
aunt
polly
placed
small
trust
in
such
evidence
she
went
out
to
see
for
herself
and
she
would
have
been
content
to
find
twenty
per
cent
of
tom
statement
true
when
she
found
the
entire
fence
whitewashed
and
not
only
whitewashed
but
elaborately
coated
and
recoated
and
even
a
streak
added
to
the
ground
her
astonishment
was
almost
unspeakable
she
said
well
i
never
there
no
getting
round
it
you
can
work
when
a
mind
to
tom
and
then
she
diluted
the
compliment
by
adding
but
it
powerful
seldom
you
a
mind
to
i
bound
to
say
well
go
and
play
but
mind
you
get
back
some
time
in
a
week
or
i
tan
you
she
was
so
overcome
by
the
splendor
of
his
achievement
that
she
took
him
into
the
closet
and
selected
a
choice
apple
and
delivered
it
to
him
along
with
an
improving
lecture
upon
the
added
value
and
flavor
a
treat
took
to
itself
when
it
came
without
sin
through
virtuous
effort
and
while
she
closed
with
a
happy
scriptural
flourish
he
hooked
a
doughnut
then
he
skipped
out
and
saw
sid
just
starting
up
the
outside
stairway
that
led
to
the
back
rooms
on
the
second
floor
clods
were
handy
and
the
air
was
full
of
them
in
a
twinkling
they
raged
around
sid
like
a
and
before
aunt
polly
could
collect
her
surprised
faculties
and
sally
to
the
rescue
six
or
seven
clods
had
taken
personal
effect
and
tom
was
over
the
fence
and
gone
there
was
a
gate
but
as
a
general
thing
he
was
too
crowded
for
time
to
make
use
of
it
his
soul
was
at
peace
now
that
he
had
settled
with
sid
for
calling
attention
to
his
black
thread
and
getting
him
into
trouble
tom
skirted
the
block
and
came
round
into
a
muddy
alley
that
led
by
the
back
of
his
aunt
he
presently
got
safely
beyond
the
reach
of
capture
and
punishment
and
hastened
toward
the
public
square
of
the
village
where
two
military
companies
of
boys
had
met
for
conflict
according
to
previous
appointment
tom
was
general
of
one
of
these
armies
joe
harper
a
bosom
friend
general
of
the
other
these
two
great
commanders
did
not
condescend
to
fight
in
person
that
being
better
suited
to
the
still
smaller
fry
but
sat
together
on
an
eminence
and
conducted
the
field
operations
by
orders
delivered
through
tom
army
won
a
great
victory
after
a
long
and
battle
then
the
dead
were
counted
prisoners
exchanged
the
terms
of
the
next
disagreement
agreed
upon
and
the
day
for
the
necessary
battle
appointed
after
which
the
armies
fell
into
line
and
marched
away
and
tom
turned
homeward
alone
as
he
was
passing
by
the
house
where
jeff
thatcher
lived
he
saw
a
new
girl
in
the
garden
a
lovely
little
creature
with
yellow
hair
plaited
into
two
white
summer
frock
and
embroidered
pantalettes
the
hero
fell
without
firing
a
shot
a
certain
amy
lawrence
vanished
out
of
his
heart
and
left
not
even
a
memory
of
herself
behind
he
had
thought
he
loved
her
to
distraction
he
had
regarded
his
passion
as
adoration
and
behold
it
was
only
a
poor
little
evanescent
partiality
he
had
been
months
winning
her
she
had
confessed
hardly
a
week
ago
he
had
been
the
happiest
and
the
proudest
boy
in
the
world
only
seven
short
days
and
here
in
one
instant
of
time
she
had
gone
out
of
his
heart
like
a
casual
stranger
whose
visit
is
done
he
worshipped
this
new
angel
with
furtive
eye
till
he
saw
that
she
had
discovered
him
then
he
pretended
he
did
not
know
she
was
present
and
began
to
show
off
in
all
sorts
of
absurd
boyish
ways
in
order
to
win
her
admiration
he
kept
up
this
grotesque
foolishness
for
some
time
but
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
some
dangerous
gymnastic
performances
he
glanced
aside
and
saw
that
the
little
girl
was
wending
her
way
toward
the
house
tom
came
up
to
the
fence
and
leaned
on
it
grieving
and
hoping
she
would
tarry
yet
awhile
longer
she
halted
a
moment
on
the
steps
and
then
moved
toward
the
door
tom
heaved
a
great
sigh
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
threshold
but
his
face
lit
up
right
away
for
she
tossed
a
pansy
over
the
fence
a
moment
before
she
disappeared
the
boy
ran
around
and
stopped
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
flower
and
then
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
began
to
look
down
street
as
if
he
had
discovered
something
of
interest
going
on
in
that
direction
presently
he
picked
up
a
straw
and
began
trying
to
balance
it
on
his
nose
with
his
head
tilted
far
back
and
as
he
moved
from
side
to
side
in
his
efforts
he
edged
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
pansy
finally
his
bare
foot
rested
upon
it
his
pliant
toes
closed
upon
it
and
he
hopped
away
with
the
treasure
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
but
only
for
a
minute
only
while
he
could
button
the
flower
inside
his
jacket
next
his
heart
or
next
his
stomach
possibly
for
he
was
not
much
posted
in
anatomy
and
not
hypercritical
anyway
he
returned
now
and
hung
about
the
fence
till
nightfall
showing
off
as
before
but
the
girl
never
exhibited
herself
again
though
tom
comforted
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
she
had
been
near
some
window
meantime
and
been
aware
of
his
attentions
finally
he
strode
home
reluctantly
with
his
poor
head
full
of
visions
all
through
supper
his
spirits
were
so
high
that
his
aunt
wondered
what
had
got
into
the
child
he
took
a
good
scolding
about
clodding
sid
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
he
tried
to
steal
sugar
under
his
aunt
very
nose
and
got
his
knuckles
rapped
for
it
he
said
aunt
you
do
whack
sid
when
he
takes
it
well
sid
do
torment
a
body
the
way
you
do
you
be
always
into
that
sugar
if
i
war
watching
you
presently
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
sid
happy
in
his
immunity
reached
for
the
a
sort
of
glorying
over
tom
which
was
wellnigh
unbearable
but
sid
fingers
slipped
and
the
bowl
dropped
and
broke
tom
was
in
ecstasies
in
such
ecstasies
that
he
even
controlled
his
tongue
and
was
silent
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
not
speak
a
word
even
when
his
aunt
came
in
but
would
sit
perfectly
still
till
she
asked
who
did
the
mischief
and
then
he
would
tell
and
there
would
be
nothing
so
good
in
the
world
as
to
see
that
pet
model
catch
it
he
was
so
brimful
of
exultation
that
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
when
the
old
lady
came
back
and
stood
above
the
wreck
discharging
lightnings
of
wrath
from
over
her
spectacles
he
said
to
himself
now
it
coming
and
the
next
instant
he
was
sprawling
on
the
floor
the
potent
palm
was
uplifted
to
strike
again
when
tom
cried
out
hold
on
now
what
you
belting
me
for
sid
broke
it
aunt
polly
paused
perplexed
and
tom
looked
for
healing
pity
but
when
she
got
her
tongue
again
she
only
said
umf
well
you
did
get
a
lick
amiss
i
reckon
you
been
into
some
other
audacious
mischief
when
i
was
around
like
enough
then
her
conscience
reproached
her
and
she
yearned
to
say
something
kind
and
loving
but
she
judged
that
this
would
be
construed
into
a
confession
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
discipline
forbade
that
so
she
kept
silence
and
went
about
her
affairs
with
a
troubled
heart
tom
sulked
in
a
corner
and
exalted
his
woes
he
knew
that
in
her
heart
his
aunt
was
on
her
knees
to
him
and
he
was
morosely
gratified
by
the
consciousness
of
it
he
would
hang
out
no
signals
he
would
take
notice
of
none
he
knew
that
a
yearning
glance
fell
upon
him
now
and
then
through
a
film
of
tears
but
he
refused
recognition
of
it
he
pictured
himself
lying
sick
unto
death
and
his
aunt
bending
over
him
beseeching
one
little
forgiving
word
but
he
would
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
die
with
that
word
unsaid
ah
how
would
she
feel
then
and
he
pictured
himself
brought
home
from
the
river
dead
with
his
curls
all
wet
and
his
sore
heart
at
rest
how
she
would
throw
herself
upon
him
and
how
her
tears
would
fall
like
rain
and
her
lips
pray
god
to
give
her
back
her
boy
and
she
would
never
never
abuse
him
any
more
but
he
would
lie
there
cold
and
white
and
make
no
sign
a
poor
little
sufferer
whose
griefs
were
at
an
end
he
so
worked
upon
his
feelings
with
the
pathos
of
these
dreams
that
he
had
to
keep
swallowing
he
was
so
like
to
choke
and
his
eyes
swam
in
a
blur
of
water
which
overflowed
when
he
winked
and
ran
down
and
trickled
from
the
end
of
his
nose
and
such
a
luxury
to
him
was
this
petting
of
his
sorrows
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
any
worldly
cheeriness
or
any
grating
delight
intrude
upon
it
it
was
too
sacred
for
such
contact
and
so
presently
when
his
cousin
mary
danced
in
all
alive
with
the
joy
of
seeing
home
again
after
an
visit
of
one
week
to
the
country
he
got
up
and
moved
in
clouds
and
darkness
out
at
one
door
as
she
brought
song
and
sunshine
in
at
the
other
he
wandered
far
from
the
accustomed
haunts
of
boys
and
sought
desolate
places
that
were
in
harmony
with
his
spirit
a
log
raft
in
the
river
invited
him
and
he
seated
himself
on
its
outer
edge
and
contemplated
the
dreary
vastness
of
the
stream
wishing
the
while
that
he
could
only
be
drowned
all
at
once
and
unconsciously
without
undergoing
the
uncomfortable
routine
devised
by
nature
then
he
thought
of
his
flower
he
got
it
out
rumpled
and
wilted
and
it
mightily
increased
his
dismal
felicity
he
wondered
if
she
would
pity
him
if
she
knew
would
she
cry
and
wish
that
she
had
a
right
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
comfort
him
or
would
she
turn
coldly
away
like
all
the
hollow
world
this
picture
brought
such
an
agony
of
pleasurable
suffering
that
he
worked
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
and
set
it
up
in
new
and
varied
lights
till
he
wore
it
threadbare
at
last
he
rose
up
sighing
and
departed
in
the
darkness
about
nine
or
ten
he
came
along
the
deserted
street
to
where
the
adored
unknown
lived
he
paused
a
moment
no
sound
fell
upon
his
listening
ear
a
candle
was
casting
a
dull
glow
upon
the
curtain
of
a
window
was
the
sacred
presence
there
he
climbed
the
fence
threaded
his
stealthy
way
through
the
plants
till
he
stood
under
that
window
he
looked
up
at
it
long
and
with
emotion
then
he
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
under
it
disposing
himself
upon
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
his
breast
and
holding
his
poor
wilted
flower
and
thus
he
would
die
out
in
the
cold
world
with
no
shelter
over
his
homeless
head
no
friendly
hand
to
wipe
the
from
his
brow
no
loving
face
to
bend
pityingly
over
him
when
the
great
agony
came
and
thus
she
would
see
him
when
she
looked
out
upon
the
glad
morning
and
oh
would
she
drop
one
little
tear
upon
his
poor
lifeless
form
would
she
heave
one
little
sigh
to
see
a
bright
young
life
so
rudely
blighted
so
untimely
cut
down
the
window
went
up
a
discordant
voice
profaned
the
holy
calm
and
a
deluge
of
water
drenched
the
prone
martyr
remains
the
strangling
hero
sprang
up
with
a
relieving
snort
there
was
a
whiz
as
of
a
missile
in
the
air
mingled
with
the
murmur
of
a
curse
a
sound
as
of
shivering
glass
followed
and
a
small
vague
form
went
over
the
fence
and
shot
away
in
the
gloom
not
long
after
as
tom
all
undressed
for
bed
was
surveying
his
drenched
garments
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
dip
sid
woke
up
but
if
he
had
any
dim
idea
of
making
any
references
to
allusions
he
thought
better
of
it
and
held
his
peace
for
there
was
danger
in
tom
eye
tom
turned
in
without
the
added
vexation
of
prayers
and
sid
made
mental
note
of
the
omission
