by

no
wonder
he
been
so
interested
in
the
talk
of
whether
our

accepted

fu
march
later
published
as
a
planet
for

ace
books
will
find
the
present
story
a
challenging
departure
this
possibility
that
the
history
we
know
may
not
be
absolute
crossroads
of
destiny
i
still
have
the
dollar
bill
it
in
my
box
at
the
bank
and
i
think
that
where
it
will
stay
i
simply
wo
destroy
it
but
i
can
think
of
nobody
to
whom
i
be
willing
to
show
it
certainly
nobody
at
the
college
my
history
department
colleagues
least
of
all
merely
to
tell
the
story
would
brand
me
irredeemably
as
a
crackpot
but
crackpots
are
tolerated
even
on
college
faculties
it
only
when
they
begin
producing
physical
evidence
that
they
get
themselves
actively
resented
when
i
went
into
the
for
a
nightcap
before
going
back
to
my
compartment
to
turn
in
there
were
five
men
there
sitting
together
one
was
an
army
officer
with
the
insignia
and
badges
of
a
staff
intelligence
colonel
next
to
him
was
a
man
of
about
my
own
age
with
sandy
hair
and
a
bony
scottish
looking
face
who
sat
staring
silently
into
a
highball
which
he
held
in
both
hands
across
the
aisle
an
elderly
man
who
could
have
been
a
lawyer
or
a
banker
was
smoking
a
cigar
over
a
glass
of
port
and
beside
him
sat
a
plump
and
slightly
too
well
groomed
individual
who
had
a
tall
colorless
drink
probably
the
fifth
man
separated
from
him
by
a
vacant
chair
seemed
to
be
dividing
his
attention
between
a
book
on
his
lap
and
the
conversation
in
which
he
was
taking
no
part
i
sat
down
beside
the
man
as
i
did
so
and
rang
for
the
waiter
the
colonel
was
saying
no
that
would
i
can
think
of
a
better
one
suppose
you
have
columbus
get
his
ships
from
henry
the
seventh
of
england
and
sail
under
the
english
instead
of
the
spanish
flag
you
know
he
did
try
to
get
english
backing
before
he
went
to
spain
but
king
henry
turned
him
down
that
could
be
changed
i
pricked
up
my
ears
the
period
from
to
the
revolution
is
my
special
field
of
american
history
and
i
knew
at
once
the
enormous
difference
that
would
have
made
it
was
a
moment
later
that
i
realized
how
oddly
the
colonel
had
expressed
the
idea
and
by
that
time
the
plump
man
was
speaking
yes
that
would
work
he
agreed
those
kings
made
decisions
most
of
the
time
on
whether
or
not
they
had
a
hangover
or
what
some
court
favorite
thought
he
got
out
a
notebook
and
pen
and
scribbled
briefly
i
hand
that
to
the
planning
staff
when
i
get
to
new
york
henry
the
seventh
not
henry
the
eighth
right
we
fix
it
so
that
columbus
will
catch
him
when
he
in
a
good
humor
that
was
too
much
i
turned
to
the
man
beside
me
what
goes
on
i
asked
has
somebody
invented
a
time
machine
he
looked
up
from
the
drink
he
was
contemplating
and
gave
me
a
grin
sounds
like
it
does
it
why
no
our
friend
here
is
getting
up
a
television
program
tell
the
gentleman
about
it
he
urged
the
plump
man
across
the
aisle
the
waiter
arrived
at
that
moment
the
plump
man
who
seemed
to
need
little
urging
waited
until
i
had
ordered
a
drink
and
then
began
telling
me
what
a
positively
sensational
idea
it
was
we
calling
it
of
he
said
it
be
a
series
one
show
a
week
in
each
episode
we
take
some
historic
event
and
show
how
history
could
have
been
changed
if
something
had
happened
differently
we
dramatize
the
event
up
to
that
point
just
as
it
really
happened
and
then
a
comes
on
and
announces
that
this
is
the
crossroads
of
destiny
this
is
where
history
could
have
been
completely
changed
then
he
gives
a
resum√©
of
what
really
did
happen
and
then
he
says
suppose
so
and
so
had
done
this
and
that
instead
of
such
and
such
then
we
pick
up
the
dramatization
at
that
point
only
we
show
it
the
way
it
might
have
happened
like
this
thing
about
columbus
we
show
how
it
could
have
happened
and
end
with
columbus
wading
ashore
with
his
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
flag
in
the
other
just
like
the
painting
only
it
be
the
english
flag
and
columbus
will
shout
take
possession
of
this
new
land
in
the
name
of
his
majesty
henry
the
seventh
of
england
he
brandished
his
drink
to
the
visible
consternation
of
the
elderly
man
beside
him
and
then
the
sailors
all
sing
save
the
which
was
written
till
about
i
could
help
mentioning
huh
the
plump
man
looked
startled
are
you
sure
then
he
decided
that
i
was
and
shrugged
well
they
can
all
shout
save
king
henry
or
george
for
england
or
something
then
at
the
end
we
introduce
the
program
guest
some
history
expert
a
real
name
and
he
tells
how
he
thinks
history
would
have
been
changed
if
it
had
happened
this
way
the
conservatively
dressed
gentleman
beside
him
wanted
to
know
how
long
he
expected
to
keep
the
show
running
the
crossroads
will
give
out
before
long
he
added
the
sponsor
give
out
first
i
said
history
is
just
one
damn
crossroads
after
another
i
mentioned
in
passing
that
i
taught
the
subject
why
since
the
beginning
of
this
century
we
had
enough
of
them
to
keep
the
show
running
for
a
year
we
have
about
twenty
already
written
and
ready
to
produce
the
plump
man
said
comfortably
and
ideas
for
twice
as
many
that
the
planning
staff
is
working
on
now
the
elderly
man
accepted
that
and
took
another
cautious
sip
of
wine
what
i
wonder
though
is
whether
you
can
really
say
that
history
can
be
changed
well
of
course
the
television
man
was
taken
aback
one
always
seems
to
be
when
a
basic
assumption
is
questioned
of
course
we
only
know
what
really
did
happen
but
it
stands
to
reason
if
something
had
happened
differently
the
results
would
have
been
different
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
would
work
out
the
same
in
the
long
run
there
be
some
differences
at
the
time
but
over
the
years
would
they
all
cancel
out
non
monsieur
the
man
with
the
book
who
had
been
outside
the
conversation
until
now
told
him
earnestly
make
no
mistake
can
be
shange
i
looked
at
him
curiously
the
accent
sounded
french
but
it
quite
right
he
was
some
kind
of
a
foreigner
though
i
swear
that
he
never
bought
the
clothes
he
was
wearing
in
this
country
the
way
the
suit
fitted
and
the
cut
of
it
and
the
and
the
necktie
the
book
he
was
reading
was
langmuir
history
of
the
american
not
one
of
my
favorites
a
bit
too
much
on
the
doctrinaire
side
but
what
a
bookshop
clerk
would
give
a
foreigner
looking
for
something
to
explain
america
what
do
you
think
professor
the
plump
man
was
asking
me
it
would
work
out
the
other
way
the
differences
would
cancel
out
they
accumulate
say
something
happened
a
century
ago
to
throw
a
presidential
election
the
other
way
you
get
different
people
at
the
head
of
the
government
opposite
lines
of
policy
taken
and
eventually
we
be
getting
into
different
wars
with
different
enemies
at
different
times
and
different
batches
of
young
men
killed
before
they
could
marry
and
have
families
different
people
being
born
or
not
being
born
that
would
mean
different
ideas
good
or
bad
being
advanced
different
books
written
different
inventions
and
different
social
and
economic
problems
as
a
consequence
look
he
only
giving
himself
a
century
the
colonel
added
think
of
the
changes
if
this
thing
we
were
discussing
columbus
sailing
under
the
english
flag
had
happened
or
suppose
leif
ericson
had
been
able
to
plant
a
permanent
colony
in
america
in
the
eleventh
century
or
if
the
saracens
had
won
the
battle
of
tours
try
to
imagine
the
world
today
if
any
of
those
things
had
happened
one
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
any
errors
you
make
in
trying
to
imagine
such
a
world
will
be
on
the
side
of
the
man
beside
me
who
had
been
using
his
highball
for
a
crystal
ball
must
have
glimpsed
in
it
what
he
was
looking
for
he
finished
the
drink
set
the
empty
glass
on
the
beside
him
and
reached
back
to
push
the
button
i
do
think
you
realize
just
how
good
an
idea
you
have
here
he
told
the
plump
man
abruptly
if
you
did
you
would
ruin
it
with
such
timid
and
unimaginative
treatment
i
thought
he
been
staying
out
of
the
conversation
because
it
was
over
his
head
instead
he
had
been
taking
the
plump
man
idea
apart
examining
all
the
pieces
and
considering
what
was
wrong
with
it
and
how
it
could
be
improved
the
plump
man
looked
startled
and
then
angry
timid
and
unimaginative
were
the
last
things
he
expected
his
idea
to
be
called
then
he
became
uneasy
maybe
this
fellow
was
a
typical
representative
of
his
lord
and
master
the
faceless
abstraction
called
the
public
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
misplaced
emphasis
you
should
emphasize
the
event
that
could
have
changed
history
you
should
emphasize
the
changes
that
could
have
been
made
you
going
to
end
this
show
you
were
talking
about
with
a
shot
of
columbus
wading
up
to
the
beach
with
an
english
flag
are
you
well
that
the
logical
ending
that
the
logical
beginning
the
man
contradicted
and
after
that
your
guest
historian
comes
on
how
much
time
will
he
be
allowed
well
maybe
three
or
four
minutes
we
ca
cut
the
dramatization
too
short
and
he
have
to
explain
a
couple
of
times
and
in
words
of
one
syllable
that
what
we
have
seen
did
really
happen
because
if
he
does
the
next
morning
half
the
kids
in
the
country
will
be
rushing
into
school
to
slip
the
teacher
the
real
inside
about
the
discovery
of
america
by
the
time
he
gets
that
done
he
be
able
to
mumble
a
couple
of
generalities
about
vast
and
incalculable
effects
and
then
it
be
time
to
tell
the
public
about
widgets
the
really
safe
cigarettes
all
filter
and
absolutely
free
from
tobacco
the
waiter
arrived
at
this
point
and
the
man
ordered
another
rye
highball
i
decided
to
have
another
bourbon
on
the
rocks
and
the
tv
impresario
said
absently
and
went
into
a
reverie
which
lasted
until
the
drinks
arrived
then
he
came
awake
again
i
see
what
you
mean
he
said
most
of
the
audience
would
wonder
what
difference
it
would
have
made
where
columbus
would
have
gotten
his
ships
as
long
as
he
got
them
and
america
got
discovered
i
can
see
it
would
have
made
a
hell
of
a
big
difference
but
how
could
it
be
handled
any
other
way
how
could
you
figure
out
just
what
the
difference
would
have
been
well
you
need
a
man
who
know
the
historical
background
and
need
a
man
with
a
powerful
creative
imagination
who
is
used
to
using
it
inside
rigorously
defined
limits
do
try
to
get
them
both
in
one
a
collaboration
would
really
be
better
then
you
work
from
the
known
situation
in
europe
and
in
america
in
and
decide
on
the
immediate
effects
and
from
that
you
have
to
carry
it
along
step
by
step
down
to
the
present
it
would
be
a
lot
of
hard
and
very
exacting
work
but
the
result
would
be
worth
it
he
took
a
sip
from
his
glass
and
added
remember
you
do
have
to
prove
that
the
world
today
would
be
the
way
you
set
it
up
all
you
have
to
do
is
make
sure
that
nobody
else
would
be
able
to
prove
that
it
would
well
how
could
you
present
that
as
a
play
with
fictional
characters
and
a
plot
time
the
present
under
the
changed
conditions
the
plot
the
reason
the
coward
conquers
his
fear
and
becomes
a
hero
the
obstacle
to
the
boy
marrying
the
girl
the
reason
the
innocent
man
is
being
persecuted
will
have
to
grow
out
of
this
imaginary
world
you
constructed
and
be
impossible
in
our
real
world
as
long
as
you
stick
to
that
you
all
right
sure
i
get
that
the
plump
man
was
excited
again
he
was
about
half
sold
on
the
idea
but
how
will
we
get
the
audience
to
accept
it
asking
them
to
start
with
an
assumption
they
know
is
true
maybe
it
is
in
another
the
colonel
suggested
you
ca
prove
it
is
for
that
matter
you
ca
prove
there
other
hah
that
it
the
man
exclaimed
world
of
alternate
probability
that
takes
care
of
that
he
drank
about
a
third
of
his
highball
and
sat
gazing
into
the
rest
of
it
in
an
almost
yogic
trance
the
plump
man
looked
at
the
colonel
in
bafflement
maybe
this
stuff
means
something
to
you
he
said
be
damned
if
it
does
to
me
well
as
far
as
we
know
we
live
in
a
universe
the
colonel
started
the
elderly
man
across
from
him
groaned
fourth
dimension
good
god
are
we
going
to
talk
about
that
it
is
anything
to
be
scared
of
you
carry
an
instrument
for
measuring
in
the
fourth
dimension
all
the
time
a
watch
you
mean
it
just
time
but
that
is
we
know
of
three
dimensions
of
space
the
colonel
told
him
gesturing
to
indicate
them
we
can
use
them
for
coordinates
to
locate
things
but
we
also
locate
things
in
time
i
would
like
to
ride
on
a
train
or
a
plane
if
we
did
well
let
call
the
time
we
know
the
time
your
watch
registers
now
suppose
the
entire
infinite
extent
of
is
only
an
instant
in
another
dimension
of
time
which
we
call
the
next
instant
of
is
also
the
entire
extent
of
and
the
next
and
the
next
as
in
different
things
are
happening
at
different
instants
in
one
of
these
instants
of
one
of
the
things
that
happening
is
that
king
henry
the
seventh
of
england
is
furnishing
ships
to
christopher
columbus
the
man
with
the
odd
clothes
was
getting
excited
again
zees
you
say
zees
alternate
probabeelitay
eet
ees
a
theory
zhenerally
accept
een
zees
countree
got
it
the
man
said
before
anybody
could
answer
he
set
his
drink
on
the
and
took
a
big
jackknife
out
of
his
pocket
holding
it
unopened
in
his
hand
how
this
sound
he
asked
and
hit
the
edge
of
the
tray
with
the
back
of
the
knife
crossroads
of
he
intoned
and
hit
the
edge
of
the
tray
again
this
is
the
year
but
not
the
of
our
world
for
we
are
in
a
world
of
alternate
probability
in
another
dimension
of
time
a
world
parallel
to
and
coexistent
with
but
separate
from
our
own
in
which
history
has
been
completely
altered
by
a
single
momentous
event
he
shifted
back
to
his
normal
voice
not
bad
only
seconds
the
plump
man
said
looking
up
from
his
wrist
watch
and
a
trained
announcer
could
maybe
shave
five
seconds
off
that
yes
something
like
that
and
at
the
end
we
have
another
thirty
seconds
and
we
can
do
without
the
guest
but
zees
alternate
probibeelitay
in
anozzer
dimension
the
stranger
was
insisting
ees
zees
a
concept
original
weet
you
he
asked
the
colonel
oh
no
that
idea
been
around
for
a
long
time
i
never
heard
of
it
before
now
the
elderly
man
said
as
though
that
completely
demolished
it
zen
eet
ees
zhenerally
accept
by
zee
scienteest
umm
no
the
man
relieved
the
colonel
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
it
and
scientists
do
accept
unsupported
assumptions
unless
they
need
them
to
explain
something
and
they
do
need
this
assumption
for
anything
well
it
would
come
in
handy
to
make
some
of
these
reports
of
freak
phenomena
like
mysterious
appearances
and
disappearances
or
sightings
or
reported
falls
of
matter
theoretically
respectable
reports
like
that
usually
get

treatment

he
studied
his
drink
for
a
moment
and
lowered
the
level
in
the
glass
slightly
i
said
that
once
in
a
while
things
get
reported
that
look
as
though
such
other
worlds
in
another
may
exist
there
have
been
whole
books
published
by
people
who
collect
stories
like
that
i
must
say
that
academic
science
is
very
hospitable
to
them
you
mean
zings
sometimes
leak
in
from
one
of
zees
ozzer
worlds
zat
has
been
known
to
things
have
been
said
to
have
happened
that
might
if
true
be
cases
of
things
leaking
through
from
another
time
world
the
man
corrected
or
leaking
away
to
another
time
world
he
mentioned
a
few
of
the
more
famous
cases
of
unexplained
mysteries
the
english
diplomat
in
prussia
who
vanished
in
plain
sight
of
a
number
of
people
the
ship
found
completely
deserted
by
her
crew
the
lifeboats
all
in
place
stories
like
that
and
there
this
rash
of
alleged
sightings
of
unidentified
flying
objects
i
sooner
believe
that
they
came
from
another
dimension
than
from
another
planet
but
as
far
as
i
know
nobody
seriously
advanced
this
theory
to
explain
them
i
think
the
idea
familiar
enough
though
that
we
can
use
it
as
an
explanation
or
for
the
program
the
television
man
said
fact
is
we
are
married
to
this
crossroads
title
yet
we
could
just
as
easily
all
it
that
would
lead
the
public
to
expect
something
out
of
the
normal
before
the
show
started
that
got
the
conversation
back
onto
the
show
and
we
talked
for
some
time
about
it
each
of
us
suggesting
possibilities
the
stranger
even
suggested
one
that
the
civil
war
had
started
during
the
jackson
administration
fortunately
nobody
else
noticed
that
finally
a
porter
came
through
and
inquired
if
any
of
us
were
getting
off
at
harrisburg
saying
that
we
would
be
getting
in
in
five
minutes
the
stranger
finished
his
drink
hastily
and
got
up
saying
that
he
would
have
to
get
his
luggage
he
told
us
how
much
he
had
enjoyed
the
conversation
and
then
followed
the
porter
toward
the
rear
of
the
train
after
he
had
gone
out
the
tv
man
chuckled
was
that
one
an
oddball
he
exclaimed
where
the
hell
do
you
suppose
he
got
that
suit
it
was
a
tailored
suit
the
colonel
said
a
very
good
one
and
i
ca
think
of
any
country
in
the
world
in
which
they
cut
suits
just
like
that
and
did
you
catch
his
accent
phony
the
television
man
pronounced
the
french
accent
of
a
greek
waiter
in
a
fake
french
restaurant
in
the
bronx
not
quite
the
pronunciation
was
all
right
for
french
accent
but
the
cadence
the
way
the
were
strung
together
was
german
the
elderly
man
looked
at
the
colonel
keenly
i
see
intelligence
he
mentioned
think
he
might
be
somebody
up
your
alley
colonel
the
colonel
shook
his
head
i
doubt
it
there
are
agents
of
unfriendly
powers
in
this
country
a
lot
of
them
i
sorry
to
have
to
say
but
they
do
speak
accented
english
and
they
do
dress
eccentrically
you
know
there
an
enemy
agent
in
a
crowd
pick
out
the
most
normally
american
type
in
sight
and
you
usually
wo
have
to
look
further
the
train
ground
to
a
stop
a
young
couple
with
came
in
and
sat
at
one
end
of
the
car
waiting
until
other
accommodations
could
be
found
for
them
after
a
while
it
started
again
i
dallied
over
my
drink
and
then
got
up
and
excused
myself
saying
that
i
wanted
to
turn
in
early
in
the
next
car
behind
i
met
the
porter
who
had
come
in
just
before
the
stop
he
looked
worried
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
spoke
to
me
pardon
sir
the
man
in
the
who
got
off
at
harrisburg
did
you
know
him
never
saw
him
before
why
he
tipped
me
with
a
dollar
bill
when
he
got
off
later
i
looked
closely
at
it
i
do
not
like
it
he
showed
it
to
me
and
i
did
blame
him
it
was
marked
and
states
of
but
outside
that
there
was
a
thing
right
about
it
one
side
was
gray
all
right
but
the
other
side
was
green
the
picture
was
the
right
one
and
there
were
a
lot
of
other
things
about
it
some
of
them
absolutely
ludicrous
it
counterfeit
it
was
even
an
imitation
of
a
united
states
bill
and
then
it
hit
me
like
a
bullet
in
the
chest
not
a
bill
of
united
states
no
wonder
he
had
been
so
interested
in
whether
our
scientists
accepted
the
theory
of
other
time
dimensions
and
other
worlds
of
alternate
probability
on
an
impulse
i
got
out
two
ones
and
gave
them
to
the
porter
perfectly
good
united
states
bank
you
better
let
me
keep
this
i
said
trying
to
make
it
sound
the
way
he
think
a
federal
agent
would
say
it
he
took
the
bills
smiling
and
i
folded
his
bill
and
put
it
into
my
vest
pocket
thank
you
sir
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
keep
it
some
part
of
my
mind
below
the
level
of
consciousness
must
have
taken
over
and
guided
me
back
to
the
right
car
and
compartment
i
realize
where
i
was
going
till
i
put
on
the
light
and
recognized
my
own
luggage
then
i
sat
down
as
dizzy
as
though
the
two
drinks
i
had
had
had
been
a
dozen
for
a
moment
i
was
tempted
to
rush
back
to
the
and
show
the
thing
to
the
colonel
and
the
man
on
second
thought
i
decided
against
that
the
next
thing
i
banished
from
my
mind
was
the
adjective
incredible
i
had
to
credit
it
i
had
the
proof
in
my
vest
pocket
the
coincidence
arising
from
our
topic
of
conversation
did
bother
me
too
much
either
it
was
the
topic
which
had
drawn
him
into
it
and
as
the
man
had
pointed
out
we
know
nothing
one
way
or
another
about
these
other
worlds
we
certainly
do
know
what
barriers
separate
them
from
our
own
or
how
often
those
barriers
may
fail
i
might
have
thought
more
about
that
if
i
been
in
physical
science
i
was
i
was
in
american
history
so
what
i
thought
about
was
what
sort
of
country
that
other
united
states
must
be
and
what
its
history
must
have
been
the
man
costume
was
basically
the
same
as
ours
same
general
style
but
many
little
differences
of
fashion
i
had
the
impression
that
it
was
the
costume
of
a
less
formal
and
conservative
society
than
ours
and
a
more
casual
way
of
life
it
could
be
the
sort
of
costume
into
which
ours
would
evolve
in
another
thirty
or
so
years
there
was
another
odd
thing
i
noticed
him
looking
curiously
at
both
the
waiter
and
the
porter
as
though
something
about
them
surprised
him
the
only
thing
they
had
in
common
was
their
race
the
same
as
every
other
attendant
but
he
was
used
to
seeing
chinese
working
in
railway
cars
and
there
had
been
that
remark
about
the
civil
war
and
the
jackson
administration
i
wondered
what
jackson
he
had
been
talking
about
not
andrew
jackson
the
tennessee
militia
general
who
got
us
into
war
with
spain
in
i
hoped
and
the
civil
war
that
had
baffled
me
completely
i
wondered
if
it
had
been
a
or
a
sectional
conflict
we
had
plenty
of
the
latter
during
our
first
century
but
all
of
them
had
been
settled
peacefully
and
constitutionally
well
some
of
the
things
he
read
in
lingmuir
would
be
surprises
for
him
too
and
then
i
took
the
bill
out
for
another
examination
it
must
have
gotten
mixed
with
his
spendable
money
it
was
about
the
size
of
ours
and
i
wondered
how
he
had
acquired
enough
of
our
money
to
pay
his
train
fare
maybe
he
had
a
diamond
and
sold
it
or
maybe
he
had
a
gun
and
held
somebody
up
if
he
had
i
did
know
that
i
blamed
him
under
the
circumstances
i
had
an
idea
that
he
had
some
realization
of
what
had
happened
to
him
the
book
and
the
fake
accent
to
cover
any
mistakes
he
might
make
well
i
wished
him
luck
and
then
i
unfolded
the
dollar
bill
and
looked
at
it
again
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
issued
by
the
united
states
department
of
treasury
itself
not
the
united
states
bank
or
one
of
the
state
banks
i
have
to
think
over
the
implications
of
that
carefully
in
the
second
place
it
was
a
silver
certificate
why
in
this
other
united
states
silver
must
be
an
acceptable
monetary
metal
maybe
equally
so
with
gold
though
i
could
hardly
believe
that
then
i
looked
at
the
picture
on
the
gray
obverse
side
and
had
to
strain
my
eyes
on
the
fine
print
under
it
to
identify
it
it
was
washington
all
right
but
a
much
older
washington
than
any
of
the
pictures
of
him
i
had
ever
seen
then
i
realized
that
i
knew
just
where
the
crossroads
of
destiny
for
his
world
and
mine
had
been
as
every
schoolchild
among
us
knows
general
george
washington
was
shot
dead
at
the
battle
of
germantown
in
by
an
english
or
rather
scottish
officer
patrick
ferguson
the
same
patrick
ferguson
who
invented
the
rifle
that
smashed
napoleon
armies
washington
today
is
one
of
our
lesser
national
heroes
because
he
was
our
first
military
but
in
this
other
world
he
must
have
survived
to
lead
our
armies
to
victory
and
become
our
first
president
as
was
the
case
with
the
man
who
took
his
place
when
he
was
killed
i
folded
the
bill
and
put
it
away
carefully
among
my
identification
cards
where
it
would
a
second
time
get
mixed
with
the
money
i
spent
and
as
i
did
i
wondered
what
sort
of
a
president
george
washington
had
made
and
what
part
in
the
history
of
that
other
united
states
had
been
played
by
the
man
whose
picture
appears
on
our
dollar
bills
general
and
president
benedict
arnold
the
end
