bruce
explains
i
expert
opinions
with
apologies
to
gent
opposite
said
clowes
i
must
say
i
think
much
of
the
team
do
apologise
to
said
allardyce
disgustedly
as
he
filled
the
teapot
i
think
they
rotten
they
ought
to
have
got
into
form
by
now
too
said
trevor
it
not
as
if
this
was
the
first
game
of
the
term
first
game
allardyce
laughed
shortly
why
we
only
got
a
couple
of
club
matches
and
the
return
match
with
ripton
to
end
the
season
it
is
about
time
they
got
into
form
as
you
say
clowes
stared
pensively
into
the
fire
they
struck
me
he
said
as
the
sort
of
team
who
get
into
form
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
cricket
season
that
about
it
said
allardyce
try
those
biscuits
trevor
about
the
only
good
thing
left
in
the
place
school
is
what
it
was
inquired
trevor
plunging
a
hand
into
the
tin
that
stood
on
the
floor
beside
him
no
said
allardyce
not
only
in
footer
but
in
everything
the
place
seems
absolutely
rotten
it
bad
enough
losing
all
our
matches
or
nearly
all
did
you
hear
that
ripton
took
points
off
us
last
term
and
we
only
just
managed
to
beat
greenburgh
by
a
try
to
nil
we
got
thirty
points
last
year
he
went
on
and
the
year
before
why
we
always
simply
walked
them
an
understood
thing
that
we
smash
them
and
this
year
they
held
us
all
the
time
and
it
was
only
a
fluke
that
we
scored
at
all
their
back
miskicked
and
let
barry
in
barry
struck
me
as
the
best
of
the
outsides
today
said
clowes
heavier
than
he
was
and
faster
he
all
right
agreed
allardyce
if
only
the
centres
would
feed
him
we
might
do
something
occasionally
but
did
you
ever
see
such
a
pair
of
rotters
the
man
who
was
marking
me
certainly
did
seem
particularly
brilliant
i
do
even
know
his
name
he
did
do
anything
at
footer
in
my
time
said
trevor
he
a
chap
called
attell
he
was
here
with
you
he
came
after
the
summer
holidays
i
believe
he
was
sacked
from
somewhere
he
no
good
but
there
nobody
else
colours
have
been
simply
a
gift
this
year
to
anyone
who
can
do
a
thing
only
barry
and
myself
left
from
last
team
i
never
saw
such
a
clearance
as
there
was
after
the
summer
term
where
are
the
boys
of
the
old
brigade
sighed
clowes
i
do
know
i
wish
they
were
here
said
allardyce
trevor
and
clowes
had
come
down
after
the
easter
term
had
been
in
progress
for
a
fortnight
to
play
for
an
oxford
a
team
against
the
school
the
match
had
resulted
in
an
absurdly
easy
victory
for
the
visitors
by
over
forty
points
clowes
had
scored
five
tries
off
his
own
bat
and
trevor
if
he
had
not
fed
his
wing
so
conscientiously
would
probably
have
scored
an
equal
number
as
it
was
he
had
got
through
twice
and
also
dropped
a
goal
the
two
were
now
having
a
late
tea
with
allardyce
in
his
study
allardyce
had
succeeded
trevor
as
captain
of
football
at
wrykyn
and
had
found
the
post
anything
but
a
sinecure
for
wrykyn
had
fallen
for
the
time
being
on
evil
days
it
was
experiencing
the
reaction
which
so
often
takes
place
in
a
school
in
the
year
following
a
season
of
exceptional
athletic
prosperity
with
trevor
as
captain
of
football
both
the
ripton
matches
had
been
won
and
also
three
out
of
the
four
other
school
matches
in
cricket
the
eleven
had
had
an
even
finer
record
winning
all
their
school
matches
and
likewise
beating
the
and
old
wrykinians
it
was
too
early
to
prophesy
concerning
the
fortunes
of
next
term
cricket
team
but
if
they
were
going
to
resemble
the
fifteen
wrykyn
was
doomed
to
the
worst
athletic
year
it
had
experienced
for
a
decade
it
a
bit
of
a
after
last
season
is
it
resumed
allardyce
returning
to
his
sorrows
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
discuss
his
painful
case
without
restraint
we
were
a
fine
team
last
year
agreed
clowes
and
especially
strong
on
the
left
wing
by
the
way
i
see
you
moved
barry
across
yes
attell
ca
pass
much
but
he
passes
better
from
right
to
left
than
from
left
to
right
so
barry
being
our
scoring
man
i
shifted
him
across
the
chap
on
the
other
wing
stanning
is
bad
at
times
do
you
remember
him
he
in
appleby
then
drummond
useful
at
half
jolly
useful
said
trevor
i
thought
he
would
be
i
recommended
you
last
year
to
keep
your
eye
on
him
decent
chap
drummond
said
clowes
about
the
only
one
there
is
left
in
the
place
observed
allardyce
gloomily
our
genial
host
said
clowes
sawing
at
the
cake
appears
to
have
that
tired
feeling
he
seems
to
have
lost
that
de
of
his
what
it
must
be
pretty
sickening
said
trevor
sympathetically
i
glad
i
was
captain
in
a
bad
year
the
rummy
thing
is
that
the
worse
they
are
the
more
side
they
stick
on
you
see
chaps
who
would
have
been
in
the
third
in
a
good
year
walking
about
in
first
fifteen
blazers
and
first
fifteen
scarves
and
first
fifteen
stockings
and
sweaters
with
first
fifteen
colours
round
the
edges
i
wonder
they
do
tattoo
their
faces
with
first
fifteen
colours
it
would
improve
some
of
them
said
clowes
allardyce
resumed
his
melancholy
remarks
but
as
i
was
saying
not
only
that
the
footer
rotten
that
you
ca
help
i
suppose
the
general
beastliness
of
things
that
i
bar
rows
with
the
town
for
instance
we
been
having
them
on
and
off
ever
since
you
left
and
it
be
worse
now
because
there
an
election
coming
off
soon
are
you
fellows
stopping
for
the
night
in
the
town
if
so
i
should
advise
you
to
look
out
for
yourselves
thanks
said
clowes
i
should
like
to
see
trevor
nor
indeed
should
i
for
choice
care
to
be
myself
but
as
it
happens
the
good
donaldson
is
putting
us
up
so
we
escape
the
perils
of
the
town
everybody
seems
so
beastly
slack
now
continued
allardyce
considered
the
thing
you
looked
on
as
an
awful
blood
if
you
say
you
have
done
a
stroke
of
work
for
a
week
i
should
mind
that
so
much
if
they
were
some
good
at
anything
but
they
ca
do
a
thing
the
footer
rotten
the
gymnasium
six
is
made
up
of
kids
an
inch
high
we
shall
probably
be
about
ninetieth
at
the
public
competition
and
there
is
any
one
who
can
play
racquets
for
nuts
the
only
thing
that
wrykyn
do
this
year
is
to
get
the
at
aldershot
drummond
ought
to
manage
that
he
won
the
feathers
last
time
he
nearly
a
stone
heavier
now
and
awfully
good
but
he
the
only
man
we
shall
send
up
i
expect
now
that
and
moriarty
are
both
gone
he
the
only
chap
we
have
who
up
to
aldershot
form
and
nobody
else
take
the
trouble
to
practice
they
all
too
slack
in
fact
said
clowes
getting
up
as
was
only
to
be
expected
the
school
started
going
to
the
dogs
directly
i
left
we
shall
have
to
be
pushing
on
now
allardyce
we
promised
to
look
in
on
seymour
before
we
went
to
bed
friend
let
us
away
good
night
said
allardyce
what
you
want
said
clowes
solemnly
is
a
liver
pill
you
are
looking
on
life
too
gloomily
take
a
pill
let
there
be
no
stint
take
two
then
we
shall
hear
your
merry
laugh
ringing
through
the
old
cloisters
once
more
buck
up
and
be
a
bright
and
happy
lad
allardyce
take
more
than
a
pill
to
make
me
that
growled
that
soured
footballer
mr
seymour
views
on
the
school
resembled
those
of
allardyce
wrykyn
in
his
opinion
was
suffering
from
a
reaction
it
always
the
same
he
said
after
a
very
good
year
boys
leave
and
it
hard
to
fill
their
places
i
must
say
i
did
not
expect
quite
such
a
clearing
out
after
the
summer
we
have
had
bad
luck
in
that
way
maurice
for
instance
and
robinson
both
ought
to
have
had
another
year
at
school
it
was
quite
unexpected
their
leaving
they
would
have
made
all
the
difference
to
the
forwards
you
must
have
somebody
to
lead
the
pack
who
has
had
a
little
experience
of
first
fifteen
matches
but
even
then
said
clowes
they
ought
to
be
so
rank
as
they
were
this
afternoon
they
seemed
such
slackers
i
afraid
that
the
failing
of
the
school
just
now
agreed
mr
seymour
they
do
play
themselves
out
they
do
put
just
that
last
ounce
into
their
work
which
makes
all
the
difference
clowes
thought
of
saying
that
to
judge
by
appearances
they
did
not
put
in
even
the
first
ounce
but
refrained
however
low
an
opinion
a
games
master
may
have
and
even
express
of
his
team
he
does
not
like
people
to
agree
too
cordially
with
his
criticisms
allardyce
seems
rather
sick
about
it
said
trevor
i
am
sorry
for
allardyce
it
is
always
unpleasant
to
be
the
only
survivor
of
an
exceptionally
good
team
he
ca
forget
last
matches
and
suffers
continual
disappointments
because
the
present
team
does
not
play
up
to
the
same
form
he
was
saying
something
about
rows
with
the
town
said
trevor
after
a
pause
yes
there
has
certainly
been
some
unpleasantness
lately
it
is
the
penalty
we
pay
for
being
on
the
outskirts
of
a
town
four
years
out
of
five
nothing
happens
but
in
the
fifth
when
the
school
has
got
a
little
out
of
hand
oh
then
it
really
got
out
of
hand
asked
clowes
between
ourselves
yes
admitted
mr
seymour
what
sort
of
rows
asked
trevor
mr
seymour
could
explain
exactly
nothing
as
it
were
definite
as
yet
no
actual
complaints
so
far
but
still
well
trouble
yes
trouble
for
instance
he
said
a
boy
in
my
house
linton
you
remember
him
is
moving
in
society
at
this
moment
with
a
swollen
lip
and
minus
a
front
tooth
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
i
fancy
he
got
into
trouble
in
the
town
that
is
merely
a
straw
which
shows
how
the
wind
is
blowing
but
if
you
lived
on
the
spot
you
would
see
more
what
i
mean
there
is
trouble
in
the
air
and
now
that
this
election
is
coming
on
i
should
not
wonder
if
things
came
to
a
head
i
ca
remember
a
single
election
in
wrykyn
when
there
was
not
disorder
in
the
town
and
if
the
school
is
going
to
join
in
as
it
probably
will
i
shall
not
be
sorry
when
the
holidays
come
i
know
the
headmaster
is
only
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
put
the
town
out
of
bounds
but
the
kids
have
always
had
a
few
rows
on
with
that
school
in
the
high
street
what
it
name
st
something
said
clowes
jude
supplied
trevor
st
jude
said
mr
seymour
have
they
i
did
know
that
oh
yes
i
do
know
how
it
started
but
it
been
going
on
for
two
or
three
years
now
it
a
school
house
feud
really
but
dexter
are
mixed
up
in
it
somehow
if
a
school
house
fag
goes
down
town
he
runs
like
an
antelope
along
the
high
street
unless
he
got
one
or
two
friends
with
him
i
saved
dozens
of
kids
from
destruction
when
i
was
at
school
the
st
jude
fellows
lie
in
wait
and
dash
out
on
them
i
used
to
find
school
house
fags
fighting
for
their
lives
in
back
alleys
the
enemy
fled
on
my
approach
my
air
of
majesty
overawed
them
but
a
junior
school
feud
matters
very
little
said
mr
seymour
you
say
it
has
been
going
on
for
three
years
and
i
have
never
heard
of
it
till
now
it
is
when
the
bigger
fellows
get
mixed
up
with
the
town
that
we
have
to
interfere
i
wish
the
headmaster
would
put
the
place
out
of
bounds
entirely
until
the
election
is
over
except
at
election
time
the
town
seems
to
go
to
sleep
that
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
said
clowes
to
trevor
i
think
we
had
better
be
off
now
sir
we
promised
mr
donaldson
to
be
in
some
time
tonight
it
later
than
i
thought
said
mr
seymour
good
night
clowes
how
many
tries
was
it
that
you
scored
this
afternoon
five
i
wish
you
were
still
here
to
score
them
for
instead
of
against
us
good
night
trevor
i
was
glad
to
see
they
tried
you
for
oxford
though
you
get
your
blue
you
be
in
next
year
all
right
good
night
the
two
old
wrykinians
walked
along
the
road
towards
donaldson
it
was
a
fine
night
but
misty
jove
i
quite
tired
said
clowes
hullo
what
up
they
were
opposite
appleby
at
the
moment
clowes
drew
him
into
the
shadow
of
the
fence
there
a
chap
breaking
out
i
saw
him
shinning
down
a
rope
wait
and
see
who
it
is
a
moment
later
somebody
ran
softly
through
the
gateway
and
disappeared
down
the
road
that
led
to
the
town
who
was
it
said
trevor
i
could
see
i
spotted
him
all
right
it
was
that
chap
who
was
marking
me
today
stanning
wonder
what
he
after
perhaps
he
gone
to
tar
the
statue
like
rather
a
sportsman
rather
a
silly
idiot
said
trevor
i
hope
he
gets
caught
you
always
were
one
of
those
kind
sympathetic
chaps
said
clowes
come
on
or
donaldson
be
locking
us
out
ii
sheen
at
home
on
the
afternoon
following
the
oxford
a
match
sheen
of
seymour
was
sitting
over
the
in
his
study
with
a
thucydides
he
had
been
staying
in
that
day
with
a
cold
he
was
always
staying
in
everyone
has
his
hobby
that
was
sheen
nobody
at
wrykyn
even
at
seymour
seemed
to
know
sheen
very
well
with
the
exception
of
drummond
and
those
who
troubled
to
think
about
the
matter
at
all
rather
wondered
what
drummond
saw
in
him
to
the
superficial
observer
the
two
had
nothing
in
common
drummond
was
good
at
games
he
was
in
the
first
fifteen
and
the
second
eleven
and
had
won
the
feather
weights
at
aldershot
and
seemed
to
have
no
interests
outside
them
sheen
on
the
other
hand
played
fives
for
the
house
and
that
was
all
he
was
bad
at
cricket
and
had
given
up
football
by
special
arrangement
with
allardyce
on
the
plea
that
he
wanted
all
his
time
for
work
he
was
in
for
an
scholarship
the
gotford
allardyce
though
professing
small
sympathy
with
such
a
degraded
ambition
had
given
him
a
special
dispensation
and
since
then
sheen
had
retired
from
public
life
even
more
than
he
had
done
hitherto
the
examination
for
the
gotford
was
to
come
off
towards
the
end
of
the
term
the
only
other
wrykinians
with
whom
sheen
was
known
to
be
friendly
were
stanning
and
attell
of
appleby
and
here
those
who
troubled
to
think
about
it
wondered
still
more
for
sheen
whatever
his
other
demerits
was
not
of
the
type
of
stanning
and
attell
there
are
certain
members
of
every
public
school
just
as
there
are
certain
members
of
every
college
at
the
universities
who
are
marked
men
they
have
never
been
detected
in
any
glaring
breach
of
the
rules
and
their
manner
towards
the
powers
that
be
is
as
a
rule
suave
even
deferential
yet
it
is
one
of
the
things
which
everybody
knows
that
they
are
in
the
black
books
of
the
authorities
and
that
sooner
or
later
in
the
picturesque
phrase
of
the
new
yorker
they
will
get
it
in
the
neck
to
this
class
stanning
and
attell
belonged
it
was
plain
to
all
that
the
former
was
the
leading
member
of
the
firm
a
glance
at
the
latter
was
enough
to
show
that
whatever
ambitions
he
may
have
had
in
the
direction
of
villainy
he
had
not
the
brains
necessary
for
really
satisfactory
evildoing
as
for
stanning
he
pursued
an
even
course
of
life
always
rigidly
obeying
the
eleventh
commandment
thou
shalt
not
be
found
out
this
kept
him
from
collisions
with
the
authorities
while
a
ready
tongue
and
an
excellent
knowledge
of
the
art
of
boxing
he
was
after
drummond
the
best
in
the
place
secured
him
at
least
tolerance
at
the
hand
of
the
school
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
most
of
those
who
knew
him
disliked
him
and
particularly
those
who
like
drummond
were
what
clowes
had
called
the
old
brigade
he
had
nevertheless
a
tolerably
large
following
a
first
fifteen
man
even
in
a
bad
year
can
generally
find
boys
anxious
to
be
seen
about
with
him
that
sheen
should
have
been
amongst
these
surprised
one
or
two
people
notably
mr
seymour
who
being
games
master
had
come
a
good
deal
into
contact
with
stanning
and
had
not
been
favourably
impressed
the
fact
was
that
the
keynote
of
sheen
character
was
a
fear
of
giving
offence
within
limits
this
is
not
a
reprehensible
trait
in
a
character
but
sheen
overdid
it
and
it
frequently
complicated
his
affairs
there
come
times
when
one
has
to
choose
which
of
two
people
one
shall
offend
by
acting
in
one
way
we
offend
a
by
acting
in
the
opposite
way
we
annoy
sheen
had
found
himself
faced
by
this
problem
when
he
began
to
be
friendly
with
drummond
their
acquaintance
begun
over
a
game
of
fives
had
progressed
sheen
admired
drummond
as
the
type
of
what
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been
if
he
could
have
managed
it
and
drummond
felt
interested
in
sheen
because
nobody
knew
much
about
him
he
was
in
a
way
mysterious
also
he
played
the
piano
really
well
and
drummond
at
that
time
would
have
courted
anybody
who
could
play
for
his
benefit
mumblin
mose
and
did
mind
obliging
with
unlimited
encores
so
the
two
struck
up
an
alliance
and
as
drummond
hated
stanning
only
a
shade
less
than
stanning
hated
him
sheen
was
under
the
painful
necessity
of
choosing
between
them
he
chose
drummond
whereby
he
undoubtedly
did
wisely
sheen
sat
with
his
thucydides
over
the
and
tried
to
interest
himself
in
the
doings
of
the
athenian
expedition
at
syracuse
his
brain
felt
heavy
and
flabby
he
realised
dimly
that
this
was
because
he
took
too
little
exercise
and
he
made
a
resolution
to
diminish
his
hours
of
work
per
diem
by
one
and
to
devote
that
one
to
fives
he
would
mention
it
to
drummond
when
he
came
in
he
would
probably
come
in
to
tea
the
board
was
spread
in
anticipation
of
a
visit
from
him
herbert
the
had
been
despatched
to
the
town
earlier
in
the
afternoon
and
had
returned
with
certain
which
were
now
stacked
in
an
appetising
heap
on
the
table
sheen
was
just
making
something
more
or
less
like
sense
out
of
an
involved
passage
of
nikias
speech
in
which
that
eminent
general
himself
seemed
to
have
only
a
hazy
idea
of
what
he
was
talking
about
when
the
door
opened
he
looked
up
expecting
to
see
drummond
but
it
was
stanning
he
felt
instantly
that
warm
shooting
sensation
from
which
david
copperfield
suffered
in
moments
of
embarrassment
since
the
advent
of
drummond
he
had
avoided
stanning
and
he
could
not
see
him
without
feeling
uncomfortable
as
they
were
both
in
the
sixth
form
and
sat
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
one
another
every
day
it
will
be
realised
that
he
was
frequently
uncomfortable
great
scott
said
stanning
swotting
sheen
glanced
almost
guiltily
at
his
thucydides
still
it
was
something
of
a
relief
that
the
other
had
not
opened
the
conversation
with
an
indictment
of
drummond
you
see
he
said
apologetically
i
in
for
the
gotford
so
am
what
the
good
of
swotting
though
i
not
going
to
do
a
stroke
as
stanning
was
the
only
one
of
his
rivals
of
whom
he
had
any
real
fear
sheen
might
have
replied
with
justice
that
if
that
was
the
case
the
more
he
swotted
the
better
but
he
said
nothing
he
looked
at
the
stove
and
the
thucydides
what
a
worm
you
are
always
staying
in
said
stanning
i
caught
a
cold
watching
the
match
yesterday
you
as
flabby
as
stanning
looked
round
for
a
simile
as
a
why
do
you
take
some
exercise
i
going
to
play
fives
i
think
i
do
need
some
exercise
fives
why
do
you
play
footer
i
have
time
i
want
to
work
what
rot
i
not
doing
a
stroke
stanning
seemed
to
derive
a
spiritual
pride
from
this
admission
tell
you
what
then
said
stanning
i
play
you
tomorrow
after
school
sheen
looked
a
shade
more
uncomfortable
but
he
made
an
effort
and
declined
the
invitation
i
shall
probably
be
playing
drummond
he
said
oh
all
right
said
stanning
do
care
play
whom
you
like
there
was
a
pause
as
a
matter
of
fact
resumed
stanning
what
i
came
here
for
was
to
tell
you
about
last
night
i
got
out
and
went
to
mitchell
why
did
you
come
did
you
get
my
note
i
sent
a
kid
with
it
mitchell
was
a
young
gentleman
of
rich
but
honest
parents
who
had
left
the
school
at
christmas
he
was
in
his
father
office
and
lived
in
his
father
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
from
time
to
time
his
father
went
up
to
london
on
matters
connected
with
business
leaving
him
alone
in
the
house
on
these
occasions
mitchell
the
younger
would
write
to
stanning
with
whom
when
at
school
he
had
been
on
friendly
terms
and
stanning
breaking
out
of
his
house
after
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
would
make
his
way
to
the
mitchell
residence
and
spend
a
pleasant
hour
or
so
there
mitchell
senior
owned
turkish
cigarettes
and
a
billiard
table
stanning
appreciated
both
there
was
also
a
piano
and
stanning
had
brought
sheen
with
him
one
night
to
play
it
the
and
the
subsequent
had
nearly
whitened
hair
and
it
was
only
by
a
series
of
miracles
that
he
had
escaped
detection
once
he
felt
was
more
than
enough
and
when
a
fag
from
appleby
had
brought
him
stanning
note
containing
an
invitation
to
a
second
jaunt
of
the
kind
he
had
refused
to
be
lured
into
the
business
again
yes
i
got
the
note
he
said
then
why
did
you
come
mitchell
was
asking
where
you
were
it
so
beastly
risky
risky
rot
we
should
get
sacked
if
we
were
caught
well
do
get
caught
then
sheen
registered
an
internal
vow
that
he
would
not
he
wanted
us
to
go
again
on
monday
will
you
come
i
do
think
i
will
stanning
said
sheen
it
is
worth
it
you
mean
you
funk
it
that
what
the
matter
with
you
yes
i
do
admitted
sheen
as
a
rule
in
stories
the
person
who
owns
that
he
is
afraid
gets
unlimited
applause
and
adulation
and
feels
a
glow
of
conscious
merit
but
with
sheen
it
was
otherwise
the
admission
made
him
if
possible
more
uncomfortable
than
he
had
been
before
mitchell
will
be
sick
said
stanning
sheen
said
nothing
stanning
changed
the
subject
well
at
anyrate
he
said
give
us
some
tea
you
seem
to
have
been
victualling
for
a
siege
i
awfully
sorry
said
sheen
turning
a
deeper
shade
of
red
and
experiencing
a
redoubled
attack
of
the
warm
shooting
but
the
fact
is
i
waiting
for
drummond
stanning
got
up
and
expressed
his
candid
opinion
of
drummond
in
a
few
words
he
said
more
he
described
sheen
too
in
unflattering
terms
look
here
he
said
you
may
think
it
jolly
fine
to
drop
me
just
because
you
got
to
know
drummond
a
bit
but
you
be
sick
enough
that
you
done
it
before
you
finished
it
is
that
began
sheen
i
do
care
what
it
is
you
slink
about
trying
to
avoid
me
all
day
and
you
wo
do
a
thing
i
ask
you
to
do
but
you
see
oh
shut
up
said
stanning
iii
sheen
receives
visitors
and
advice
while
sheen
had
been
interviewing
stanning
in
study
twelve
farther
down
the
passage
linton
and
his
friend
dunstable
who
was
in
house
were
discussing
ways
and
means
like
stanning
dunstable
had
demanded
tea
and
had
been
informed
that
there
was
none
for
him
well
you
are
a
bright
specimen
are
you
said
dunstable
seating
himself
on
the
table
which
should
have
been
groaning
under
the
weight
of
cake
and
biscuits
i
should
like
to
know
where
you
expect
to
go
to
you
lure
me
in
here
and
then
have
the
cheek
to
tell
me
you
have
got
anything
to
eat
what
have
you
done
with
it
all
there
was
half
a
cake
bring
it
on
young
menzies
bagged
it
after
the
match
yesterday
his
brother
came
down
with
the
oxford
a
team
and
he
had
to
give
him
tea
in
his
study
then
there
were
some
biscuits
what
the
matter
with
biscuits
all
right
bring
them
on
biscuits
forward
show
biscuits
menzies
took
them
as
well
dunstable
eyed
him
sorrowfully
you
always
were
a
bit
of
a
maniac
he
said
but
i
never
thought
you
were
quite
such
a
complete
gibberer
as
to
let
menzies
get
away
with
all
your
grub
well
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
touch
him
for
tea
he
owes
us
one
come
on
they
proceeded
down
the
passage
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
study
three
hullo
said
menzies
as
they
entered
we
come
to
tea
said
dunstable
cut
the
satisfying
sandwich
see
a
little
more
of
that
hissing
urn
of
yours
menzies
bustle
about
and
be
the
dashing
host
i
was
expecting
you
i
ca
help
your
troubles
said
dunstable
i
not
got
anything
i
was
thinking
of
coming
to
you
linton
where
that
cake
finished
my
brother
simply
walked
into
it
greed
said
dunstable
unkindly
seems
to
be
the
besetting
sin
of
the
menzies
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
do
wish
to
threaten
but
i
a
demon
when
i
roused
being
done
out
of
my
tea
is
sure
to
rouse
me
and
owing
to
unfortunate
accident
of
being
stonily
broken
i
ca
go
to
the
shop
you
responsible
for
the
slump
in
provisions
menzies
and
you
must
see
us
through
this
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
either
of
you
chaps
know
sheen
at
all
i
do
said
linton
not
to
speak
to
you
ca
expect
us
to
know
all
your
shady
friends
said
dunstable
why
he
got
a
tea
on
this
evening
if
you
knew
him
well
enough
you
might
borrow
something
from
him
i
met
herbert
in
the
carrying
in
all
sorts
of
things
to
his
study
still
if
you
do
know
him
do
let
a
trifle
of
that
sort
stand
in
the
way
said
dunstable
which
is
his
study
come
on
linton
said
dunstable
be
a
man
and
lead
the
way
go
in
as
if
he
invited
us
ten
to
one
he
think
he
did
if
you
spoil
the
thing
by
laughing
what
invite
ourselves
to
tea
asked
linton
beginning
to
grasp
the
idea
that
it
sheen
the
sort
of
ass
who
wo
do
a
thing
anyhow
its
worth
trying
smith
in
our
house
got
a
tea
out
of
him
that
way
last
term
coming
menzies
not
much
i
hope
he
kicks
you
out
come
on
then
linton
if
menzies
cares
to
chuck
away
a
square
meal
let
him
thus
no
sooner
had
the
door
of
sheen
study
closed
upon
stanning
than
it
was
opened
again
to
admit
linton
and
dunstable
well
said
linton
affably
here
we
are
hope
we
not
late
said
dunstable
you
said
somewhere
about
five
it
just
struck
shall
we
start
he
stooped
and
took
the
kettle
from
the
stove
do
you
bother
he
said
to
sheen
who
had
watched
this
manoeuvre
with
an
air
of
amazement
i
do
all
the
dirty
work
but
began
sheen
that
all
right
said
dunstable
soothingly
i
like
it
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
affair
was
too
much
for
sheen
he
could
not
recollect
having
invited
linton
with
whom
he
had
exchanged
only
about
a
dozen
words
that
term
much
less
dunstable
whom
he
merely
knew
by
sight
yet
here
they
were
behaving
like
honoured
guests
it
was
plain
that
there
was
a
misunderstanding
somewhere
but
he
shrank
from
grappling
with
it
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
their
feelings
it
would
be
awkward
enough
if
they
discovered
their
mistake
for
themselves
so
he
exerted
himself
nervously
to
play
the
host
and
the
first
twinge
of
remorse
which
linton
felt
came
when
sheen
pressed
upon
him
a
bag
of
biscuits
which
he
knew
could
not
have
cost
less
than
one
and
sixpence
a
pound
his
heart
warmed
to
one
who
could
do
the
thing
in
such
style
dunstable
apparently
was
worried
by
no
scruples
he
leaned
back
easily
in
his
chair
and
kept
up
a
bright
flow
of
conversation
you
not
looking
well
sheen
he
said
you
ought
to
take
more
exercise
why
do
you
come
down
town
with
us
one
of
these
days
and
do
a
bit
of
canvassing
it
a
rag
linton
lost
a
tooth
at
it
the
other
day
we
going
down
on
saturday
to
do
a
bit
more
oh
said
sheen
politely
we
shall
get
one
or
two
more
chaps
to
help
next
time
it
is
good
enough
only
us
two
we
had
four
great
beefy
hooligans
on
to
us
when
linton
got
his
tooth
knocked
out
we
had
to
run
there
a
regular
gang
of
them
going
about
the
town
now
that
the
election
on
a
fellow
who
looks
like
a
butcher
seems
to
boss
the
show
they
call
him
albert
he
have
to
be
slain
one
of
these
days
for
the
credit
of
the
school
i
should
like
to
get
drummond
on
to
him
i
was
expecting
drummond
to
tea
said
sheen
he
running
and
passing
with
the
fifteen
said
linton
he
ought
to
be
in
soon
why
here
he
is
hullo
drummond
hullo
said
the
newcomer
looking
at
his
two
as
if
he
were
surprised
to
see
them
there
how
were
the
first
asked
dunstable
oh
rotten
any
tea
left
conversation
flagged
from
this
point
and
shortly
afterwards
dunstable
and
linton
went
come
and
tea
with
me
some
time
said
linton
oh
thanks
said
sheen
thanks
awfully
it
was
rather
a
shame
said
linton
to
dunstable
as
they
went
back
to
their
study
rushing
him
like
that
i
should
wonder
if
he
quite
a
good
sort
when
one
gets
to
know
him
he
must
be
a
rotter
to
let
himself
be
rushed
by
jove
i
should
like
to
see
someone
try
that
game
on
with
me
in
the
study
they
had
left
drummond
was
engaged
in
pointing
this
out
to
sheen
the
first
are
rank
bad
he
said
the
outsides
were
passing
rottenly
today
we
shall
have
another
forty
points
taken
off
us
when
we
play
ripton
by
the
way
i
did
know
you
were
a
pal
of
linton
i
not
said
sheen
well
he
seemed
pretty
much
at
home
just
now
i
ca
understand
it
i
certain
i
never
asked
him
to
tea
or
dunstable
either
yet
they
came
in
as
if
i
had
i
did
like
to
hurt
their
feelings
by
telling
them
drummond
stared
what
they
came
without
being
asked
heavens
man
you
must
buck
up
a
bit
and
keep
awake
or
you
have
an
awful
time
of
course
those
two
chaps
were
simply
trying
it
on
i
had
an
idea
it
might
be
that
when
i
came
in
why
did
you
let
them
why
did
you
scrag
them
oh
i
do
know
said
sheen
uncomfortably
but
look
here
it
rot
you
keep
your
end
up
in
a
place
like
this
or
everybody
in
the
house
be
ragging
you
chaps
will
naturally
play
the
goat
if
you
let
them
has
this
ever
happened
before
sheen
admitted
reluctantly
that
it
had
he
was
beginning
to
see
things
it
is
never
pleasant
to
feel
one
has
been
bluffed
once
last
term
he
said
smith
a
chap
in
day
came
to
tea
like
that
i
could
very
well
do
anything
and
dunstable
is
in
day
they
compared
notes
i
wonder
you
had
the
whole
school
dropping
in
on
you
lining
up
in
long
queues
down
the
passage
look
here
sheen
you
really
must
pull
yourself
together
i
not
ragging
you
have
a
beastly
time
if
you
so
feeble
i
hope
you
wo
be
sick
with
me
for
saying
it
but
i
ca
help
that
all
for
your
own
good
and
it
really
pure
slackness
that
the
cause
of
it
all
i
hate
hurting
people
feelings
said
sheen
oh
rot
as
if
anybody
here
had
any
feelings
besides
it
does
hurt
a
chap
feelings
being
told
to
get
out
when
he
knows
he
no
business
in
a
place
oh
all
right
said
sheen
shortly
glad
you
see
it
said
drummond
well
i
off
wonder
if
anybody
in
that
bath
he
reappeared
a
few
moments
later
during
his
absence
sheen
overheard
certain
shrill
protestations
which
were
apparently
being
uttered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bathroom
door
there
was
he
said
putting
his
head
into
the
study
and
grinning
cheerfully
at
sheen
there
was
young
renford
who
had
no
earthly
business
to
be
there
i
just
looked
in
to
point
the
moral
suppose
you
have
let
him
bag
all
the
hot
water
which
ought
to
have
come
to
his
elders
and
betters
for
fear
of
hurting
his
feelings
and
gone
without
your
bath
i
went
on
my
theory
that
nobody
at
wrykyn
least
of
all
a
fag
has
any
feelings
i
turfed
him
out
without
a
touch
of
remorse
you
get
much
the
best
results
my
way
so
long
and
the
head
disappeared
and
shortly
afterwards
there
came
from
across
the
passage
muffled
but
cheerful
sounds
of
splashing
iv
the
better
part
of
valour
the
borough
of
wrykyn
had
been
a
little
unfortunate
or
fortunate
according
to
the
point
of
view
in
the
matter
of
elections
the
latter
point
of
view
was
that
of
the
younger
and
more
irresponsible
section
of
the
community
which
liked
elections
because
they
were
exciting
the
former
was
that
of
the
tradespeople
who
disliked
them
because
they
got
their
windows
broken
wrykyn
had
passed
through
an
election
and
its
attendant
festivities
in
the
previous
year
when
sir
eustace
briggs
the
mayor
of
the
town
had
been
returned
by
a
comfortable
majority
since
then
had
caused
that
gentleman
to
resign
his
seat
and
the
place
was
once
more
in
a
state
of
unrest
this
time
the
school
was
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
the
previous
election
had
not
stirred
them
they
did
not
care
whether
sir
eustace
briggs
defeated
mr
saul
pedder
or
whether
mr
saul
pedder
wiped
the
political
floor
with
sir
eustace
briggs
mr
pedder
was
an
energetic
radical
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
wrykyn
had
always
returned
a
conservative
member
and
did
not
see
its
way
to
a
change
as
yet
his
energy
had
done
him
very
little
good
the
school
had
looked
on
him
as
a
sportsman
and
read
his
speeches
in
the
local
paper
with
amusement
but
they
were
not
interested
now
however
things
were
changed
the
conservative
candidate
sir
william
bruce
was
one
of
themselves
an
old
wrykinian
a
governor
of
the
school
a
man
who
always
watched
and
the
donor
of
the
bruce
challenge
cup
for
the
school
mile
in
fine
one
of
the
best
he
was
also
the
father
of
jack
bruce
a
on
the
engineering
side
the
school
would
have
liked
to
have
made
a
popular
hero
of
jack
bruce
if
he
had
liked
he
could
have
gone
about
with
quite
a
suite
of
retainers
but
he
was
a
quiet
youth
and
was
rarely
to
be
seen
in
public
the
engineering
side
of
a
public
school
has
workshops
and
other
weirdnesses
which
keep
it
occupied
after
the
ordinary
school
hours
it
was
generally
understood
that
bruce
was
a
good
sort
of
chap
if
you
knew
him
but
you
had
got
to
know
him
first
brilliant
at
his
work
and
devoted
to
it
a
useful
slow
bowler
known
to
be
able
to
drive
and
repair
the
family
one
who
seldom
spoke
unless
spoken
to
but
who
when
he
did
speak
generally
had
something
sensible
to
say
beyond
that
report
said
little
as
he
refused
to
allow
the
school
to
work
off
its
enthusiasm
on
him
they
were
obliged
to
work
it
off
elsewhere
hence
the
disturbances
which
had
become
frequent
between
school
and
town
the
inflammatory
speeches
of
mr
saul
pedder
had
caused
a
swashbuckling
spirit
to
spread
among
the
rowdy
element
of
the
town
gangs
of
youths
to
adopt
the
term
had
developed
a
habit
of
parading
the
streets
shouting
good
old
pedder
when
these
met
some
person
or
persons
who
did
not
consider
mr
pedder
good
and
old
there
was
generally
what
the
local
described
as
a
frakkus
it
was
in
one
of
these
frakkuses
that
linton
had
lost
a
valuable
tooth
two
days
had
elapsed
since
dunstable
and
linton
had
looked
in
on
sheen
for
tea
it
was
a
saturday
afternoon
and
was
just
over
there
was
no
first
fifteen
match
only
a
rather
uninteresting
templar
donaldson
and
existence
in
the
school
grounds
showed
signs
of
becoming
tame
what
a
beastly
term
the
easter
term
is
said
linton
yawning
there
wo
be
a
thing
to
do
till
the
begin
properly
seymour
had
won
their
first
match
as
had
day
they
would
not
be
called
upon
to
perform
for
another
week
or
more
let
get
a
boat
out
suggested
dunstable
such
a
beastly
day
let
have
tea
at
the
shop
rather
slow
how
about
going
to
cook
all
right
toss
you
who
pays
cook
was
a
shop
in
the
town
to
which
the
school
most
resorted
when
in
need
of
refreshment
wonder
if
we
shall
meet
albert
linton
licked
the
place
where
his
tooth
should
have
been
and
said
he
hoped
so
sergeant
cook
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
was
examining
a
broken
window
when
they
arrived
and
muttering
to
himself
hullo
said
dunstable
what
this
new
idea
for
ventilation
golly
massa
who
frew
dat
brick

mongrel
old
pedder

says
then
bang
it
comes
right
on
top
of
the
muffins
and
when
i
doubled
out
after

mrs
cook
appeared
and
corroborated
witness
evidence
dunstable
ordered
tea
we
may
meet
him
on
our
way
home
said
linton
if
we
do
i
give
him
something
from
you
with
your
love
i
owe
him
a
lot
for
myself
mrs
cook
clicked
her
tongue
compassionately
at
the
sight
of
the
obvious
void
in
the
speaker
mouth
you
to
a
forlse
one
mr
linton
said
sergeant
cook
with
gloomy
relish
the
back
shop
was
empty
dunstable
and
linton
sat
down
and
began
tea
sergeant
cook
came
to
the
door
from
time
to
time
and
dilated
further
on
his
grievances
gentlemen
from
the
school
they
come
in
and
says
ai
it
all
a
joke
and
exciting
and
what
not
but
i
says
to
them
you
got
to
live
in
it
i
says
that
what
it
is
you
got
to
live
in
it
i
says
glad
when
it
all
over
that
what
i
be
jug
of
hot
water
please
said
linton
the
sergeant
shouted
the
order
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
on
parade
and
returned
to
his
woes
you
got
to
live
in
it
i
says
that
what
it
is
it
this
everlasting
worry
and
flurry
day
in
and
day
out
and
not
knowing
going
to
next
and
one
man
coming
in
and
saying
for
bruce
and
another
for
pedder
and
another
saying
how
it
the
poor
man
loaf
he
fighting
for
if
he
only
a
loaf
now
wot
this
there
was
a
confused
noise
without
as
shakespeare
would
put
it
and
into
the
shop
came
clattering
barry
and
mctodd
of
seymour
closely
followed
by
stanning
and
attell
this
is
getting
a
bit
too
thick
said
barry
collapsing
into
a
chair
from
the
outer
shop
came
the
voice
of
sergeant
cook
let
me
jest
come
to
you
you
roars
of
derision
from
the
road
that
albert
said
linton
jumping
up
yes
i
heard
them
call
him
that
said
barry
mctodd
and
i
were
coming
down
here
to
tea
when
they
started
going
for
us
so
we
nipped
in
here
hoping
to
find
reinforcements
we
were
just
behind
you
said
stanning
i
got
one
of
them
a
beauty
he
went
down
like
a
shot
albert
inquired
linton
no
a
little
chap
let
go
out
and
smash
them
up
suggested
linton
excitedly
dunstable
treated
the
situation
more
coolly
wait
a
bit
he
said
no
hurry
let
finish
tea
at
any
rate
better
eat
as
much
as
you
can
now
linton
you
may
have
no
teeth
left
to
do
it
with
afterwards
he
added
cheerfully
let
chuck
things
at
them
said
mctodd
do
be
an
ass
said
barry
what
on
earth
the
good
of
that
well
it
would
be
something
said
mctodd
vaguely
hit
with
a
muffin
suggested
stanning
dash
i
barked
my
knuckles
on
that
man
but
i
bet
he
felt
it
look
here
i
going
out
said
linton
come
on
dunstable
dunstable
continued
his
meal
without
hurry
what
the
excitement
he
said
there
plenty
of
time
dear
old
albert
not
the
sort
of
chap
to
go
away
when
he
got
us
cornered
here
the
first
principle
of
warfare
is
to
get
a
good
feed
before
you
start
and
anyhow
said
barry
i
came
here
for
tea
and
i
going
to
have
it
sergeant
cook
was
recalled
from
the
door
and
received
the
orders
they
just
gone
round
the
corner
he
said
and
that
one
says
he
goin
to
wait
if
he
to
wait
all
night
quite
right
said
dunstable
approvingly
sensible
chap
albert
if
you
see
him
you
might
tell
him
we
sha
be
long
will
you
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
kerm
out
shouted
a
voice
from
the
street
dunstable
looked
at
the
others
perhaps
we
might
be
moving
now
he
said
getting
up
ready
we
must
keep
together
said
barry
you
goin
out
mr
dunstable
inquired
sergeant
cook
yes
good
bye
you
see
that
we
decently
buried
wo
you
the
garrison
made
its
sortie
it
happened
that
drummond
and
sheen
were
also
among
those
whom
it
had
struck
that
afternoon
that
tea
at
cook
would
be
pleasant
and
they
came
upon
the
combatants
some
five
minutes
after
battle
had
been
joined
the
town
contingent
were
filling
the
air
with
strange
cries
albert
voice
being
easily
heard
above
the
din
while
the
wrykinians
as
men
should
were
fighting
quietly
and
without
unseemly
tumult
by
jove
said
drummond
here
a
row
on
sheen
stopped
dead
with
a
queer
sinking
feeling
within
him
he
gulped
drummond
did
not
notice
these
portents
he
was
observing
the
battle
suddenly
he
uttered
an
exclamation
why
it
some
of
our
chaps
there
a
seymour
cap
is
that
mctodd
and
great
scott
there
barry
come
on
man
sheen
did
not
move
ought
we
to
get
mixed
up
he
began
drummond
looked
at
him
with
open
eyes
sheen
babbled
on
the
old
man
might
not
like
sixth
form
you
see
ought
we
to
there
was
a
yell
of
triumph
from
the
town
army
as
the
albert
plunging
through
the
fray
sent
barry
staggering
against
the
wall
sheen
caught
a
glimpse
of
albert
grinning
face
as
he
turned
he
had
a
cut
over
one
eye
it
bled
come
on
said
drummond
beginning
to
run
to
the
scene
of
action
sheen
paused
for
a
moment
irresolutely
then
he
walked
rapidly
in
the
opposite
direction
v
the
white
feather
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
his
study
that
sheen
thoroughly
realised
what
he
had
done
all
the
way
home
he
had
been
defending
himself
eloquently
against
an
imaginary
accuser
and
he
had
built
up
a
very
sound
thoughtful
and
logical
series
of
arguments
to
show
that
he
was
not
only
not
to
blame
for
what
he
had
done
but
had
acted
in
highly
statesmanlike
and
praiseworthy
manner
after
all
he
was
in
the
sixth
not
a
prefect
it
was
true
but
still
practically
a
prefect
the
headmaster
disliked
unpleasantness
between
school
and
town
much
more
so
between
the
sixth
form
of
the
school
and
the
town
therefore
he
had
done
his
duty
in
refusing
to
be
drawn
into
a
fight
with
albert
and
friends
besides
why
should
he
be
expected
to
join
in
whenever
he
saw
a
couple
of
fellows
fighting
it
was
reasonable
it
was
no
business
of
his
why
it
was
absurd
he
had
no
quarrel
with
those
fellows
it
was
cowardice
it
was
simply
that
he
had
kept
his
head
better
than
drummond
and
seen
further
into
the
matter
besides
but
when
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
this
mood
changed
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
view
one
takes
of
things
when
one
is
walking
briskly
and
that
which
comes
when
one
thinks
the
thing
over
coldly
as
he
sat
there
the
wall
of
defence
which
he
had
built
up
slipped
away
brick
by
brick
and
there
was
the
fact
staring
at
him
without
covering
or
disguise
it
was
no
good
arguing
against
himself
no
amount
of
argument
could
wipe
away
the
truth
he
had
been
afraid
and
had
shown
it
and
he
had
shown
it
when
in
a
sense
he
was
representing
the
school
when
wrykyn
looked
to
him
to
help
it
keep
its
end
up
against
the
town
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
he
saw
how
were
the
consequences
of
that
failure
in
the
hour
of
need
he
had
disgraced
himself
he
had
disgraced
seymour
he
had
disgraced
the
school
he
was
an
outcast
this
mood
the
natural
reaction
from
his
first
glow
of
almost
jaunty
lasted
till
the
bell
rang
when
it
was
succeeded
by
another
this
time
he
took
a
more
reasonable
view
of
the
affair
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
a
chance
that
his
defection
had
passed
unnoticed
nothing
could
make
his
case
seem
better
in
his
own
eyes
but
it
might
be
that
the
thing
would
end
there
the
house
might
not
have
lost
credit
an
overwhelming
curiosity
seized
him
to
find
out
how
it
had
all
ended
the
ten
minutes
of
grace
which
followed
the
ringing
of
the
bell
had
passed
drummond
and
the
rest
must
be
back
by
now
he
went
down
the
passage
to
drummond
study
somebody
was
inside
he
could
hear
him
he
knocked
at
the
door
drummond
was
sitting
at
the
table
reading
he
looked
up
and
there
was
a
silence
sheen
mouth
felt
dry
he
could
not
think
how
to
begin
he
noticed
that
drummond
face
was
unmarked
looking
down
he
saw
that
one
of
the
knuckles
of
the
hand
that
held
the
book
was
swollen
and
cut
drummond
i
drummond
lowered
the
book
get
out
he
said
he
spoke
without
heat
calmly
as
if
he
were
making
some
conventional
remark
by
way
of
starting
a
conversation
i
only
came
to
ask
get
out
said
drummond
again
there
was
another
pause
drummond
raised
his
book
and
went
on
reading
sheen
left
the
room
outside
he
ran
into
linton
unlike
drummond
linton
bore
marks
of
the
encounter
as
in
the
case
of
the
hero
of
calverley
poem
one
of
his
speaking
eyes
was
sable
the
swelling
of
his
lip
was
increased
there
was
a
deep
red
bruise
on
his
forehead
in
spite
of
these
injuries
however
he
was
cheerful
he
was
whistling
when
sheen
collided
with
him
sorry
said
linton
and
went
on
into
the
study
well
he
said
how
are
you
feeling
drummond
lucky
beggar
you
have
got
a
mark
i
wish
i
could
duck
like
you
well
we
have
fought
the
good
fight
exit
albert
sweep
him
up
you
gave
him
enough
to
last
him
for
the
rest
of
the
term
i
could
tackle
the
brute
he
as
strong
as
a
horse
my
word
it
was
lucky
you
happened
to
come
up
albert
was
making
hay
of
us
still
all
well
that
ends
well
we
have
smitten
the
philistines
this
day
by
the
way
what
up
now
who
was
that
chap
with
you
when
you
came
up
which
chap
i
thought
i
saw
some
one
you
should
eat
so
much
tea
you
saw
double
there
was
anybody
no
said
drummond
not
sheen
no
said
drummond
irritably
how
many
more
times
do
you
want
me
to
say
it
all
right
said
linton
i
only
asked
i
met
him
outside
who
sheen
oh
you
might
be
sociable
i
know
i
might
but
i
want
to
read
lucky
man
wish
i
could
i
can
hardly
see
well
good
bye
then
off
good
grunted
drummond
you
know
your
way
out
do
you
linton
went
back
to
his
own
study
it
all
very
well
he
said
to
himself
for
drummond
to
deny
it
but
i
swear
i
saw
sheen
with
him
so
did
dunstable
i
cut
out
and
ask
him
about
it
after
prep
if
he
really
was
there
and
cut
off
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
the
chap
ought
to
be
kicked
he
a
disgrace
to
the
house
dunstable
questioned
after
preparation
refused
to
commit
himself
i
thought
i
saw
somebody
with
drummond
he
said
and
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
it
was
sheen
still
i
was
pretty
busy
at
the
time
and
paying
much
attention
to
anything
except
that
long
thin
bargee
with
the
bowler
i
wish
those
men
would
hit
straight
it
beastly
difficult
to
guard
a
swing
my
right
ear
feels
like
a
cauliflower
does
it
look
rum
beastly
but
what
about
this
you
ca
swear
to
sheen
then
no
better
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
what
does
drummond
say
you
ought
to
ask
him
i
have
he
says
he
was
alone
well
that
settles
it
what
an
ass
you
are
if
drummond
does
know
who
does
i
believe
he
simply
hushing
it
up
well
let
us
hush
it
up
too
it
no
good
bothering
about
it
we
licked
them
all
right
but
it
such
a
beastly
thing
for
the
house
then
why
the
dickens
do
you
want
it
to
get
about
surely
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
dry
up
and
say
nothing
about
it
but
something
ought
to
be
done
what
the
good
of
troubling
about
a
man
like
sheen
he
never
was
any
good
and
this
does
make
him
very
much
worse
besides
probably
be
sick
enough
on
his
own
account
i
know
i
should
if
done
it
and
anyway
we
do
know
that
he
did
do
it
i
certain
he
did
i
could
swear
it
was
him
anyhow
for
goodness
sake
let
the
thing
drop
all
right
but
i
shall
cut
him
well
that
would
be
punishment
enough
for
anybody
whatever
he
done
fancy
existence
without
your
bright
conversation
it
does
bear
thinking
of
you
do
look
a
freak
with
that
eye
and
that
lump
on
your
forehead
you
ought
to
wear
a
mask
that
ear
of
yours
said
linton
with
satisfaction
will
be
about
three
times
its
ordinary
size
tomorrow
and
it
always
was
too
large
good
night
on
his
way
back
to
seymour
mason
of
appleby
who
was
standing
at
his
house
gate
imbibing
fresh
air
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
accosted
him
i
say
linton
he
said
hullo
you
look
a
wreck
do
you
i
say
what
all
this
about
your
house
what
about
my
house
funking
and
all
that
sheen
you
know
stanning
has
just
been
telling
me
then
he
saw
him
too
exclaimed
linton
involuntarily
oh
it
true
then
did
he
really
cut
off
like
that
stanning
said
he
did
but
i
would
believe
him
at
first
you
are
going
good
night
so
the
thing
was
out
linton
had
not
counted
on
stanning
having
seen
what
he
and
dunstable
had
seen
it
was
impossible
to
hush
it
up
now
the
scutcheon
of
seymour
was
definitely
blotted
the
name
of
the
house
was
being
held
up
to
scorn
in
appleby
probably
everywhere
else
as
well
it
was
a
nuisance
thought
linton
but
it
could
not
be
helped
after
all
it
was
a
judgment
on
the
house
for
harbouring
such
a
specimen
as
sheen
in
seymour
there
was
tumult
and
an
impromptu
indignation
meeting
stanning
had
gone
to
work
scientifically
from
the
moment
that
ducking
under
the
guard
of
a
sturdy
town
youth
he
had
caught
sight
of
sheen
retreating
from
the
fray
he
had
grasped
the
fact
that
here
was
his
chance
of
working
off
his
grudge
against
him
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
spread
the
news
abroad
and
the
school
would
do
the
rest
on
his
return
from
the
town
he
had
mentioned
the
facts
of
the
case
to
one
or
two
of
the
more
garrulous
members
of
his
house
and
they
had
passed
it
on
to
everybody
they
met
during
the
interval
in
the
middle
of
preparation
by
the
end
of
preparation
half
the
school
knew
what
had
happened
seymour
was
furious
the
senior
to
a
man
condemned
sheen
the
junior
was
crimson
in
the
face
and
incoherent
the
demeanour
of
a
junior
in
moments
of
excitement
generally
lacks
that
repose
which
marks
the
philosopher
he
ought
to
be
kicked
shrilled
renford
we
shall
get
rotted
by
those
kids
in
dexter
moaned
harvey
disgracing
the
house
thundered
watson
let
go
and
chuck
things
at
his
door
suggested
renford
a
move
was
made
to
the
passage
in
which
sheen
study
was
situated
and
with
divers
groans
and
howls
the
junior
hove
football
boots
and
cricket
stumps
at
the
door
the
success
of
the
meeting
however
was
entirely
neutralised
by
the
fact
that
in
the
same
passage
stood
the
study
of
rigby
the
head
of
the
house
also
rigby
was
trying
at
the
moment
to
turn
into
idiomatic
greek
verse
the
words
the
days
of
peace
and
slumberous
calm
have
fled
and
this
corroboration
of
the
statement
annoyed
him
to
the
extent
of
causing
him
to
dash
out
and
sow
lines
among
the
revellers
like
some
monarch
scattering
largesse
the
junior
retired
to
its
lair
to
inveigh
against
the
brutal
ways
of
those
in
authority
and
begin
working
off
the
commission
it
had
received
the
howls
in
the
passage
were
the
first
official
intimation
sheen
had
received
that
his
shortcomings
were
public
property
the
word
funk
shouted
through
his
keyhole
had
not
unnaturally
given
him
an
inkling
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
so
drummond
had
given
him
away
he
thought
probably
he
had
told
linton
the
whole
story
the
moment
after
he
sheen
had
met
the
latter
at
the
door
of
the
study
and
perhaps
he
was
now
telling
it
to
the
rest
of
the
house
of
all
the
mixed
sensations
from
which
he
suffered
as
he
went
to
his
dormitory
that
night
one
of
resentment
against
drummond
was
the
keenest
sheen
was
in
the
fourth
dormitory
where
the
majority
of
the
slept
he
was
in
the
position
of
a
sort
of
extra
house
prefect
as
far
as
the
dormitory
was
concerned
it
was
a
large
dormitory
and
mr
seymour
had
fancied
that
it
might
perhaps
be
something
of
a
handful
for
a
single
prefect
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
drummond
who
was
in
charge
had
shown
early
in
the
term
that
he
was
more
than
capable
of
managing
the
place
single
handed
he
was
popular
and
determined
the
dormitory
was
orderly
partly
because
it
liked
him
principally
because
it
had
to
be
he
had
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
his
powers
of
control
that
night
when
sheen
came
in
the
room
was
full
drummond
was
in
bed
reading
his
novel
the
other
ornaments
of
the
dormitory
were
in
various
stages
of
undress
as
sheen
appeared
a
sudden
hissing
broke
out
from
the
farther
corner
of
the
room
sheen
flushed
and
walked
to
his
bed
the
hissing
increased
in
volume
and
richness
shut
up
that
noise
said
drummond
without
looking
up
from
his
book
the
hissing
diminished
only
two
or
three
of
the
more
reckless
kept
it
up
drummond
looked
across
the
room
at
them
stop
that
noise
and
get
into
bed
he
said
quietly
the
hissing
ceased
he
went
on
with
his
book
again
silence

disliked
especially
by
the
vicar
but
to
be
really
an
outcast
to
feel
that
one
has
no
friend
in
the
world
one
must
break
an
important
commandment
sheen
had
always
been
something
of
a
hermit
in
his
most
sociable
moments
he
had
never
had
more
than
one
or
two
friends
but
he
had
never
before
known
what
it
meant
to
be
completely
isolated
it
was
like
living
in
a
world
of
ghosts
or
rather
like
being
a
ghost
in
a
living
world
that
disagreeable
experience
of
being
looked
through
as
if
one
were
invisible
comes
to
the
average
person
it
may
be
half
a
dozen
times
in
his
life
sheen
had
to
put
up
with
it
a
hundred
times
a
day
people
who
were
talking
to
one
another
stopped
when
he
appeared
and
waited
until
he
had
passed
on
before
beginning
again
altogether
he
was
made
to
feel
that
he
had
done
for
himself
that
as
far
as
the
life
of
the
school
was
concerned
he
did
not
exist
there
had
been
some
talk
particularly
in
the
senior
of
more
active
measures
it
was
thought
that
nothing
less
than
a
could
meet
the
case
but
the
house
prefects
had
been
against
it
sheen
was
in
the
sixth
and
however
monstrous
and
unspeakable
might
have
been
his
acts
it
would
hardly
do
to
treat
him
as
if
he
were
a
junior
and
the
scheme
had
been
definitely
discouraged
by
drummond
who
had
stated
without
wrapping
the
gist
of
his
remarks
in
elusive
phrases
that
in
the
event
of
a
being
held
he
would
interview
the
president
of
the
same
and
knock
his
head
off
so
seymour
had
fallen
back
on
the
punishment
which
from
their
earliest
beginnings
the
public
schools
have
meted
out
to
their
criminals
they
had
cut
sheen
dead
in
a
way
sheen
benefited
from
this
excommunication
now
that
he
could
not
even
play
fives
for
want
of
an
opponent
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
work
fortunately
he
had
an
object
the
gotford
would
be
coming
on
in
a
few
weeks
and
the
more
work
he
could
do
for
it
the
better
though
stanning
was
the
only
one
of
his
rivals
whom
he
feared
and
though
was
known
to
be
taking
very
little
trouble
over
the
matter
it
was
best
to
run
as
few
risks
as
possible
stanning
was
one
of
those
people
who
produce
great
results
in
their
work
without
seeming
to
do
anything
for
them
so
sheen
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
and
ground
grimly
away
at
his
books
and
for
exercise
went
for
walks
it
was
a
monotonous
kind
of
existence
for
the
space
of
a
week
the
only
wrykinian
who
spoke
a
single
word
to
him
was
bruce
the
son
of
the
conservative
candidate
for
wrykyn
and
bruce
conversation
had
been
limited
to
two
remarks
he
had
said
you
might
play
that
again
will
you
and
later
thanks
he
had
come
into
the
while
sheen
was
practising
one
afternoon
and
had
sat
down
without
speaking
on
a
chair
by
the
door
when
sheen
had
played
for
the
second
time
the
piece
which
had
won
his
approval
bruce
thanked
him
and
left
the
room
as
the
solitary
break
in
the
monotony
of
the
week
sheen
remembered
the
incident
rather
vividly
since
the
great
rout
of
albert
and
his
minions
outside
cook
things
as
far
as
the
seniors
were
concerned
had
been
quiet
between
school
and
town
linton
and
dunstable
had
gone
to
and
from
cook
two
days
in
succession
without
let
or
hindrance
it
was
generally
believed
that
owing
to
the
unerring
way
in
which
he
had
put
his
head
in
front
of
drummond
left
on
that
memorable
occasion
the
one
was
at
present
for
repairs
the
story
in
the
school
it
had
grown
with
the
days
was
that
drummond
had
laid
the
enemy
out
on
the
pavement
with
a
sickening
crash
and
that
he
had
still
been
there
at
so
to
speak
the
close
of
play
as
a
matter
of
fact
albert
was
in
excellent
shape
and
only
an
unfortunate
previous
engagement
prevented
him
from
ranging
the
streets
near
cook
as
before
sir
william
bruce
was
addressing
a
meeting
in
another
part
of
the
town
and
albert
thought
it
his
duty
to
be
on
hand
to
boo
in
the
junior
portion
of
the
school
the
feud
with
the
town
was
brisk
mention
has
been
made
of
a
certain
st
jude
between
which
seat
of
learning
and
the
fags
of
dexter
and
the
school
house
there
was
a
spirited
vendetta
jackson
of
dexter
was
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
movement
jackson
was
a
lad
yet
mad
at
moments
as
a
hatter
and
he
derived
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
from
warring
against
st
jude
it
helped
him
to
enjoy
his
meals
he
slept
the
better
for
it
after
a
little
turn
up
with
a
judy
he
was
fuller
of
that
spirit
of
manly
fortitude
and
forbearance
so
necessary
to
those
whom
fate
brought
frequently
into
contact
with
mr
dexter
the
judies
wore
and
it
was
an
enjoyable
pastime
sending
these
spinning
into
space
during
one
of
the
usual
in
the
high
street
from
the
fact
that
he
and
his
friends
were
invariably
outnumbered
there
was
a
sporting
element
in
these
affairs
though
occasionally
this
inferiority
of
numbers
was
the
cause
of
his
executing
a
scientific
retreat
with
the
enemy
harassing
his
men
up
to
the
very
edge
of
the
town
this
had
happened
on
the
last
occasion
there
had
been
casualties
no
fewer
than
six
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
and
he
himself
had
been
tripped
up
and
rolled
in
a
puddle
he
burned
to
avenge
this
disaster
coming
down
to
cook
he
said
to
his
ally
painter
it
was
just
a
week
since
the
sheen
episode
all
right
said
painter
suppose
we
go
by
the
high
street
suggested
jackson
casually
then
we
better
get
a
few
more
chaps
said
painter
a
few
more
chaps
were
collected
and
the
party
numbering
eight
set
off
for
the
town
there
were
present
such
stalwarts
as
borwick
and
crowle
both
of
dexter
and
tomlin
of
the
school
house
a
useful
man
to
have
by
you
in
an
emergency
it
was
tomlin
who
on
one
occasion
attacked
by
two
terrific
champions
of
st
jude
in
a
narrow
passage
had
vanquished
them
both
and
sent
their
miles
into
the
empyrean
so
that
they
were
never
the
same
again
but
wore
ever
after
a
bruised
and
draggled
look
the
expedition
passed
down
the
high
street
without
adventure
until
by
common
consent
it
stopped
at
the
lofty
wall
which
bounded
the
playground
of
st
jude
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
came
sounds
of
revelry
shrill
squealings
and
shoutings
the
judies
were
disporting
themselves
at
one
of
their
weird
games
it
was
known
that
they
played
and
scandal
said
that
another
of
their
favourite
recreations
was
marbles
the
juniors
at
wrykyn
believed
that
it
was
to
hide
these
excesses
from
the
gaze
of
the
public
that
the
playground
wall
had
been
made
so
high
who
had
peeped
through
the
door
in
the
said
wall
reported
that
what
the
judies
seemed
to
do
mostly
was
to
chase
one
another
about
the
playground
shrieking
at
the
top
of
their
voices
but
they
added
this
was
probably
a
mere
ruse
to
divert
suspicion
they
had
almost
certainly
got
the
marbles
in
their
pockets
all
the
time
the
expedition
stopped
and
looked
itself
in
the
face
how
about
buzzing
something
at
them
said
jackson
earnestly
you
can
get
oranges
over
the
road
said
tomlin
in
his
helpful
way
jackson
vanished
into
the
shop
indicated
and
reappeared
a
few
moments
later
with
a
brown
paper
bag
it
seems
a
beastly
waste
suggested
the
economical
painter
that
all
right
said
jackson
they
all
bad
the
man
thought
i
was
rotting
him
when
i
asked
if
he
got
any
bad
oranges
but
i
got
them
at
last
give
us
a
leg
up
some
one
willing
hands
urged
him
to
the
top
of
the
wall
he
drew
out
a
green
orange
and
threw
it
there
was
a
sudden
silence
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
then
a
howl
of
wrath
went
up
to
the
heavens
jackson
rapidly
emptied
his
bag
got
him
he
exclaimed
as
the
last
orange
sped
on
its
way
look
out
they
coming
the
expedition
had
begun
to
move
off
with
quiet
dignity
when
from
the
doorway
in
the
wall
there
poured
forth
a
stream
of
warriors
shrieking
defiance
the
expedition
advanced
to
meet
them
as
usual
the
judies
had
the
advantage
in
numbers
and
filled
to
the
brim
with
righteous
indignation
they
were
proceeding
to
make
things
uncommonly
warm
for
the
invaders
painter
had
lost
his
cap
and
tomlin
three
waistcoat
buttons
when
the
eye
of
jackson
roving
up
and
down
the
street
was
caught
by
a
seymour
cap
he
was
about
to
shout
for
assistance
when
he
perceived
that
the
newcomer
was
sheen
and
refrained
it
was
no
use
he
felt
asking
sheen
for
help
but
just
as
sheen
arrived
and
the
ranks
of
the
expedition
were
beginning
to
give
way
before
the
strenuous
onslaught
of
the
judies
the
latter
almost
with
one
accord
turned
and
bolted
into
their
playground
again
looking
round
tomlin
that
first
of
generals
saw
the
reason
and
uttered
a
warning
a
mutual
foe
had
appeared
from
a
passage
on
the
left
of
the
road
there
had
debouched
on
to
the
field
of
action
albert
himself
and
two
of
his
band
the
expedition
flew
without
false
shame
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
one
of
albert
calibre
would
have
troubled
to
attack
such
small
game
but
it
was
the
firm
opinion
of
the
wrykyn
fags
and
the
judies
that
he
and
his
men
were
to
be
avoided
the
newcomers
did
not
pursue
them
they
contented
themselves
with
shouting
at
them
one
of
the
band
threw
a
stone
then
they
caught
sight
of
sheen
albert
said
oo
er
and
advanced
at
the
double
his
companions
followed
him
sheen
watched
them
come
and
backed
against
the
wall
his
heart
was
thumping
furiously
he
was
in
for
it
now
he
felt
he
had
come
down
to
the
town
with
this
very
situation
in
his
mind
a
wild
idea
of
doing
something
to
restore
his
and
his
credit
in
the
eyes
of
the
house
had
driven
him
to
the
high
street
but
now
that
the
crisis
had
actually
arrived
he
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
in
his
study
again
albert
was
quite
close
now
sheen
could
see
the
marks
which
had
resulted
from
his
interview
with
drummond
with
all
his
force
sheen
hit
out
and
experienced
a
curious
thrill
as
his
fist
went
home
it
was
a
poor
blow
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
but
sheen
fives
had
given
him
muscle
and
it
checked
albert
that
youth
however
recovered
rapidly
and
the
next
few
moments
passed
in
a
whirl
for
sheen
he
received
a
stinging
blow
on
his
left
ear
and
another
which
deprived
him
of
his
whole
stock
of
breath
and
then
he
was
on
the
ground
conscious
only
of
a
wish
to
stay
there
for
ever
vii
mr
joe
bevan
almost
involuntarily
he
staggered
up
to
receive
another
blow
which
sent
him
down
again
that
do
said
a
voice
sheen
got
up
panting
between
him
and
his
assailant
stood
a
short
sturdy
man
in
a
tweed
suit
he
was
waving
albert
back
and
albert
appeared
to
be
dissatisfied
he
was
arguing
hotly
with
the
newcomer
now
you
go
away
said
that
worthy
mildly
just
you
go
away
albert
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
speaker
would
do
well
not
to
come
interfering
in
what
did
concern
him
what
he
wanted
asserted
albert
was
a
thick
ear
coming
pushing
yourself
in
added
albert
querulously
you
go
away
repeated
the
stranger
you
go
away
i
do
want
to
have
trouble
with
you
albert
reply
was
to
hit
out
with
his
left
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
face
the
stranger
without
fuss
touched
the
back
of
albert
wrist
gently
with
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
and
albert
turning
round
in
a
circle
ended
the
manoeuvre
with
his
back
towards
his
opponent
he
faced
round
again
irresolutely
the
thing
had
surprised
him
you
go
away
said
the
other
as
if
he
were
making
the
observation
for
the
first
time
it
joe
bevan
said
one
of
albert
friends
excitedly
albert
jaw
fell
his
freckled
face
paled
you
go
away
repeated
the
man
in
the
tweed
suit
whose
conversation
seemed
inclined
to
run
in
a
groove
this
time
albert
took
the
advice
his
friends
had
already
taken
it
thanks
said
sheen
beware
said
mr
bevan
oracularly
of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
that
th
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
always
counter
back
when
you
guard
when
a
man
shows
you
his
right
like
that
always
push
out
your
hand
straight
the
straight
left
rules
the
boxing
world
feeling
better
sir
yes
thanks
he
got
that
right
in
just
on
the
spot
i
was
watching
when
you
see
a
man
coming
to
hit
you
with
his
right
like
that
do
you
draw
back
get
on
top
of
him
he
ca
hit
you
then
that
feeling
of
utter
collapse
which
is
the
immediate
result
of
a
blow
in
the
parts
about
the
waistcoat
was
beginning
to
pass
away
and
sheen
now
felt
capable
of
taking
an
interest
in
sublunary
matters
once
more
his
ear
smarted
horribly
and
when
he
put
up
a
hand
and
felt
it
the
pain
was
so
great
that
he
could
barely
refrain
from
uttering
a
cry
but
however
physically
battered
he
might
be
he
was
feeling
happier
and
more
satisfied
with
himself
than
he
had
felt
for
years
he
had
been
beaten
but
he
had
fought
his
best
and
not
given
in
some
portion
of
his
came
back
to
him
as
he
reviewed
the
late
encounter
mr
bevan
regarded
him
approvingly
he
was
too
heavy
for
you
he
said
he
a
good
twelve
stone
i
make
it
i
should
put
you
at
ten
stone
say
ten
stone
three
call
it
nine
stone
twelve
in
condition
but
you
got
pluck
sir
sheen
opened
his
eyes
at
this
surprising
statement
some
i
met
would
have
laid
down
after
getting
that
first
hit
but
you
got
up
again
that
the
secret
of
fighting
always
keep
going
on
never
give
in
you
know
what
shakespeare
says
about
the
one
who
first
cries
enough
do
you
read
shakespeare
sir
yes
said
sheen
ah
now
knew
his
business
said
mr
bevan
enthusiastically
was
as
you
may
say
was
a
novice
sheen
agreed
that
shakespeare
had
written
some
good
things
in
his
time
that
what
you
want
to
remember
always
keep
going
on
as
the
saying
is
i
was
fighting
dick
roberts
at
the
national
an
american
he
was
from
san
francisco
he
come
at
me
with
his
right
stretched
out
and
i
think
he
going
to
hit
me
with
it
when
blessed
if
his
left
do
come
out
instead
and
my
golly
it
nearly
knocked
a
passage
through
me
just
where
that
fellow
hit
you
sir
he
hit
me
it
was
just
at
the
end
of
the
round
and
i
went
back
to
my
corner
jim
blake
was
seconding
me
this
jim
i
says
the
man
mad
or
what
he
says
that
what
the
matter
get
on
top
of
him
on
top
of
him
i
says
golly
i
get
on
top
of
the
roof
if
going
to
hit
me
another
of
those
but
i
kept
on
and
got
close
to
him
and
he
could
get
in
another
of
them
and
he
give
in
after
the
seventh
round
what
competition
was
that
asked
sheen
mr
bevan
laughed
it
was
a
contest
sir
for
aside
and
the
light
weight
championship
of
the
world
sheen
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
he
had
always
imagined
professional
pugilists
to
be
and
to
a
man
he
was
not
prepared
for
one
of
mr
joe
bevan
description
for
all
the
marks
of
his
profession
that
he
bore
on
his
face
in
the
shape
of
lumps
and
scars
he
might
have
been
a
curate
his
face
looked
tough
and
his
eyes
harboured
always
a
curiously
alert
questioning
expression
as
if
he
were
perpetually
sizing
up
the
person
he
was
addressing
but
otherwise
he
was
like
other
men
he
seemed
also
to
have
a
pretty
taste
in
literature
this
combined
with
his
strong
and
capable
air
attracted
sheen
usually
he
was
shy
and
ill
at
ease
with
strangers
joe
bevan
he
felt
he
had
known
all
his
life
do
you
still
fight
he
asked
no
said
mr
bevan
i
gave
it
up
a
man
finds
he
getting
on
as
the
saying
is
and
it
do
do
to
keep
at
it
too
long
i
teach
and
i
train
but
i
do
fight
now
a
sudden
idea
flashed
across
sheen
mind
he
was
still
glowing
with
that
pride
which
those
who
are
accustomed
to
work
with
their
brains
feel
when
they
have
gone
honestly
through
some
labour
of
the
hands
at
that
moment
he
felt
himself
capable
of
fighting
the
world
and
beating
it
the
small
point
that
albert
had
knocked
him
out
of
time
in
less
than
a
minute
did
not
damp
him
at
all
he
had
started
on
the
right
road
he
had
done
something
he
had
stood
up
to
his
man
till
he
could
stand
no
longer
an
unlimited
vista
of
action
stretched
before
him
he
had
tasted
the
pleasure
of
the
fight
and
he
wanted
more
why
he
thought
should
he
not
avail
himself
of
joe
bevan
services
to
help
him
put
himself
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
term
shortly
before
the
public
schools
competitions
at
aldershot
boxing
cups
were
competed
for
at
wrykyn
it
would
be
a
dramatic
act
of
reparation
to
the
house
if
he
could
win
the
cup
for
it
his
imagination
jumping
wide
gaps
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
his
not
being
good
enough
to
win
it
in
the
scene
which
he
conjured
up
in
his
mind
he
was
an
easy
victor
after
all
there
was
the
greater
part
of
the
term
to
learn
in
and
he
would
have
a
champion
of
the
world
to
teach
him
mr
bevan
cut
in
on
his
reflections
as
if
he
had
heard
them
by
some
process
of
wireless
telegraphy
now
look
here
sir
he
said
you
should
let
me
give
you
a
few
lessons
you
plucky
but
you
do
know
the
game
as
yet
and
boxing
a
thing
every
one
ought
to
know
supposition
is
crossing
a
field
or
going
down
a
street
with
your
sweetheart
or
your
wife
sheen
was
neither
engaged
nor
married
but
he
let
the
point
pass
and
up
comes
one
of
these
hooligans
as
they
call
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
he
starts
his
games
why
nothing
if
you
ca
box
you
may
be
plucky
but
you
ca
beat
him
and
if
you
beat
him
you
get
half
murdered
yourself
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
learn
to
box
and
then
what
happens
why
as
soon
as
he
sees
you
shaping
he
says
to
himself
this
chap
knows
too
much
for
me
i
off
and
off
he
runs
or
supposition
is
he
comes
for
you
you
do
mind
not
you
you
give
him
one
punch
in
the
right
place
and
then
you
go
off
to
your
tea
leaving
him
lying
there
he
wo
get
up
i
like
to
learn
said
sheen
i
should
be
awfully
obliged
if
teach
me
i
wonder
if
you
could
make
me
any
good
by
the
end
of
the
term
the
house
competitions
come
off
then
that
all
depends
sir
it
comes
easier
to
some
than
others
if
you
know
how
to
shoot
your
left
out
straight
that
as
good
as
six
teaching
after
that
it
all
the
straight
left
beats
the
world
where
shall
i
find
you
i
training
a
young
chap
eight
stone
seven
and
he
got
to
get
down
to
eight
stone
four
for
a
bantam
weight
match
at
an
inn
up
the
river
here
i
daresay
you
know
it
sir
or
any
one
would
tell
you
where
it
is
the
boar
it
called
you
come
there
any
time
you
like
to
name
sir
and
you
find
me

should
like
to
come

day
said
sheen
would
that
be
too
often
oftener
the
better
sir

practise
too
much
then
i
start
next
week
thanks

much
by
the
way

up
the
river
for
some
time
the
school
generally
goes
down
stream
it
not
what
you
call
far
said
bevan
but
it
would
be
easier
for
you
to
come
by
road
i
have
a
bicycle
would
one
of
your
friends
lend
you
one
sheen
flushed
no

i
think
i

on
tuesday
at
about
five
will
that
suit
you
yes
sir
that
will
be
a
good
time
then
i
say
good
bye
sir
for
the
present
sheen
went
back
to
his
house
in
a
different
mood
from
the
one
in
which
he
had
left
it
he
did
not
care
now
when
the
other
seymourites
looked
through
him
in
the
passage
he
met
linton
and
grinned
pleasantly
at
him
what
the
dickens
was
that
man
grinning
at
said
linton
to
himself
i
must
have
a
smut
or
something
on
my
face
but
a
close
inspection
in
the
dormitory
revealed
no
blemish
on
his
handsome
features
viii
a
naval
battle
and
its
consequences
what
a
go
is
life
let
us
examine
the
case
of
jackson
of
dexter
who
had
left
dexter
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
had
once
complained
to
clowes
of
the
manner
in
which
his
treated
him
and
clowes
had
remarked
in
his
melancholy
way
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
breach
of
the
law
that
dexter
should
persist
in
leading
a
fellow
a
dog
life
without
a
dog
licence
for
him
that
was
precisely
how
jackson
felt
on
the
subject
things
became
definitely
unbearable
on
the
day
after
sheen
interview
with
mr
joe
bevan
was
morn
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
jackson
sprang
from
his
little
cot
to
embark
on
the
labours
of
the
day
unfortunately
he
sprang
ten
minutes
too
late
and
came
down
to
breakfast
about
the
time
of
the
second
slice
of
bread
and
marmalade
result
a
hundred
lines
proceeding
to
school
he
had
again
fallen
foul
of
his
in
whose
form
he
was
over
a
matter
of
unprepared
livy
as
a
matter
of
fact
jackson
prepared
the
livy
or
rather
he
had
not
absolutely
it
but
he
had
meant
to
but
it
was
mr
templar
preparation
and
mr
templar
was
any
one
will
understand
therefore
that
it
would
have
been
simply
chucking
away
the
gifts
of
providence
if
he
had
not
gone
on
with
the
novel
which
he
had
been
reading
up
till
the
last
moment
before
and
had
brought
along
with
him
accidentally
as
it
were
it
was
a
book
called
spoiler
of
by
richard
marsh
and
there
was
a
repulsive
crime
on
nearly
every
page
it
was
hot
stuff
much
better
than
livy
lunch
score
two
hundred
lines
during
lunch
he
had
the
misfortune
to
upset
a
glass
of
water
pure
accident
of
course
but
there
it
was
do
you
know
all
over
the
table
mr
dexter
had
called
him
a
clumsy
b
a
pig
and
had
given
him
advice
you
had
better
be
careful
jackson
a
present
two
hundred
lines
jackson
on
the
match
being
resumed
at
two
with
four
hundred
lines
on
the
he
had
played
a
fine
free
game
during
afternoon
school
and
mr
dexter
who
objected
to
fine
free
games
or
indeed
any
games
during
school
hours
had
increased
the
total
to
six
hundred
when
stumps
were
drawn
for
the
day
so
on
a
bright
sunny
saturday
afternoon
when
he
should
have
been
out
in
the
field
cheering
the
on
to
victory
against
the
school
house
jackson
sat
in
the
junior
at
dexter
copying
out
portions
of
virgil
aeneid
two
to
him
later
on
in
the
afternoon
when
he
had
finished
half
his
task
entered
painter
with
the
news
that
dexter
had
taken
thirty
points
off
the
school
house
just
after
mopped
them
up
said
the
terse
and
epigrammatic
painter
made
rings
round
them
have
you
finished
yet
well
chuck
it
and
come
out
what
on
asked
jackson
we
going
to
have
a
boat
race
pile
it
on
we
are
really
fact
some
of
these
school
house
kids
are
awfully
sick
about
the
match
and
challenged
us
that
chap
tomlin
thinks
he
can
row
he
ca
row
for
nuts
said
jackson
he
does
know
which
end
of
the
oar
to
shove
into
the
water
i
seen
cats
that
could
row
better
than
tomlin
that
what
i
told
him
at
least
i
said
he
could
row
for
toffee
so
he
said
all
right
i
bet
i
can
lick
you
and
i
said
i
betted
he
could
and
he
said
all
right
then
let
try
and
then
the
other
chaps
wanted
to
join
in
so
we
made
an
thing
of
it
and
i
want
you
to
come
and
stroke
us
jackson
hesitated
mr
dexter
setting
the
lines
on
friday
had
certainly
said
that
they
were
to
be
shown
up
tomorrow
evening
he
had
said
it
very
loud
and
clear
still
in
a
case
like
this
after
all
by
helping
to
beat
the
school
house
on
the
river
he
would
be
giving
dexter
a
and
what
more
could
the
man
want
right
ho
said
jackson
down
at
the
school
the
enemy
were
already
afloat
when
painter
and
jackson
arrived
buck
up
cried
the
school
house
crew
dexter
embarked
five
strong
there
was
room
for
two
on
each
seat
jackson
shared
the
post
of
stroke
with
painter
crowle
steered
ready
asked
tomlin
from
the
other
boat
half
a
said
jackson
what
the
course
oh
do
you
know
yet
up
to
the
town
round
the
island
just
below
the
bridge
the
island
with
the
croquet
ground
on
it
know
and
back
again
here
ready
in
a
jiffy
look
here
crowle
remember
about
steering
you
pull
the
right
line
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
right
and
the
other
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
left
all
right
said
the
injured
crowle
as
if
i
did
know
that
thought
i
mention
it
it
your
fault
nobody
could
tell
by
looking
at
you
that
you
knew
anything
except
how
to
eat
ready
you
chaps
when
i
say
said
tomlin
it
was
a
subject
of
heated
discussion
between
the
crews
for
weeks
afterwards
whether
dexter
boat
did
or
did
not
go
off
at
the
word
two
opinions
were
divided
on
the
topic
but
it
was
certain
that
jackson
and
his
men
led
from
the
start
pulling
a
good
splashing
stroke
which
had
drenched
crowle
to
the
skin
in
the
first
thirty
yards
dexter
boat
crept
slowly
ahead
by
the
time
the
island
was
reached
it
led
by
a
length
encouraged
by
success
the
leaders
redoubled
their
already
energetic
efforts
crowle
sat
in
a
he
was
even
moved
to
speech
about
it
when
you
finished
said
crowle
jackson
intent
upon
repartee
caught
a
crab
and
the
school
house
drew
level
again
the
two
boats
passed
the
island
abreast
just
here
occurred
one
of
those
unfortunate
incidents
both
crews
had
quickened
their
stroke
until
the
boats
had
practically
been
converted
into
submarines
and
the
rival
coxswains
were
observing
bitterly
to
space
that
this
was
jolly
well
the
last
time
they
ever
let
themselves
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
when
round
the
island
there
hove
in
sight
a
flotilla
of
boats
directly
in
the
path
of
the
racers
there
were
three
of
them
and
not
even
the
spray
which
played
over
them
like
a
fountain
could
prevent
crowle
from
seeing
that
they
were
manned
by
judies
even
on
the
river
these
outcasts
wore
their
look
out
shrieked
crowle
pulling
hard
on
his
right
line
stop
rowing
you
chaps
we
shall
be
into
them
at
the
same
moment
the
school
house
oarsmen
ceased
pulling
the
two
boats
came
to
a
halt
a
few
yards
from
the
enemy
what
up
panted
jackson
crimson
from
his
exertions
hullo
the
judies
tomlin
was
parleying
with
the
foe
why
the
dickens
ca
you
keep
out
of
the
way
spoiling
our
race
wait
till
we
get
ashore
but
the
judies
it
seemed
were
not
prepared
to
wait
even
for
that
short
space
of
time
a
miscreant
larger
than
the
common
run
of
judy
made
a
brief
but
popular
address
to
his
men
splash
them
he
said
instantly
amid
shrieks
of
approval
oars
began
to
strike
the
water
and
the
water
began
to
fly
over
the
wrykyn
boats
which
were
now
surrounded
the
latter
were
not
slow
to
join
battle
with
the
same
weapons
homeric
laughter
came
from
the
bridge
above
the
town
bridge
was
a
sort
of
loafers
club
to
which
the
entrance
fee
was
a
screw
of
tobacco
and
the
subscription
an
occasional
remark
upon
the
weather
here
gathered
together
day
by
day
that
section
of
the
populace
which
resented
it
when
they
asked
for
employment
and
only
got
work
instead
from
morn
till
eve
they
lounged
against
the
balustrades
surveying
nature
and
hoping
it
would
be
kind
enough
to
give
them
some
excitement
that
day
an
occasional
found
in
them
an
eager
audience
no
runaway
horse
ever
bored
them
a
was
meat
and
drink
to
them
they
had
an
appetite
for
every
spectacle
when
therefore
the
water
began
to
fly
from
boat
to
boat
men
fetched
their
friends
from
neighbouring
public
houses
and
craned
with
them
over
the
parapet
observing
the
sport
and
commenting
thereon
it
was
these
comments
that
attracted
mr
dexter
attention
when
cycling
across
the
bridge
he
found
the
south
side
of
it
entirely
congested
and
heard
raucous
voices
urging
certain
unseen
little
now
to
go
it
and
anon
to
vote
for
pedder
his
curiosity
was
aroused
he
dismounted
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
until
he
got
a
clear
view
of
what
was
happening
below
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
most
stirring
incident
of
the
fight
the
biggest
of
the
judy
boats
had
been
propelled
by
the
current
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
dexter
argo
no
sooner
was
it
within
distance
than
jackson
dropping
his
oar
grasped
the
side
and
pulled
it
towards
him
the
two
boats
crashed
together
and
rocked
violently
as
the
crews
rose
from
their
seats
and
grappled
with
one
another
a
hurricane
of
laughter
and
applause
went
up
from
the
crowd
upon
the
bridge
the
next
moment
both
boats
were
bottom
upwards
and
drifting
sluggishly
down
towards
the
island
while
the
crews
swam
like
rats
for
the
other
boats
every
wrykinian
had
to
learn
to
swim
before
he
was
allowed
on
the
river
so
that
the
peril
of
jackson
and
his
crew
was
not
extreme
and
it
was
soon
speedily
evident
that
swimming
was
also
part
of
the
judy
curriculum
for
the
shipwrecked
ones
were
soon
climbing
drippingly
on
board
the
surviving
ships
where
they
sat
and
made
puddles
and
shrieked
defiance
at
their
antagonists
this
was
accepted
by
both
sides
as
the
end
of
the
fight
and
the
combatants
parted
without
further
hostilities
each
fleet
believing
that
the
victory
was
with
them
and
mr
dexter
mounting
his
bicycle
again
rode
home
to
tell
the
headmaster
that
evening
after
preparation
the
headmaster
held
a
reception
among
distinguished
visitors
were
jackson
painter
tomlin
crowle
and
six
others
on
the
monday
morning
the
headmaster
issued
a
manifesto
to
the
school
after
prayers
he
had
he
said
for
some
time
entertained
the
idea
of
placing
the
town
out
of
bounds
he
would
do
so
now
no
boy
unless
he
was
a
prefect
would
be
allowed
till
further
notice
to
cross
the
town
bridge
as
regarded
the
river
for
the
future
boating
wrykinians
must
confine
their
attentions
to
the
lower
river
nobody
must
take
a
boat
the
school
boatman
would
have
strict
orders
to
see
that
this
rule
was
rigidly
enforced
any
breach
of
these
bounds
would
he
concluded
be
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
the
headmaster
of
wrykyn
was
not
a
hasty
man
he
thought
before
he
put
his
foot
down
but
when
he
did
he
put
it
down
heavily
sheen
heard
the
ultimatum
with
dismay
he
was
a
person
and
here
he
was
faced
with
a
dilemma
that
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
choose
between
breaking
school
rules
of
the
most
important
kind
or
pulling
down
all
the
castles
he
had
built
in
the
air
before
the
mortar
had
had
time
to
harden
between
their
stones
he
wished
he
could
talk
it
over
with
somebody
but
he
had
nobody
with
whom
he
could
talk
over
anything
he
must
think
it
out
for
himself
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
thinking
it
out
and
by
nightfall
he
had
come
to
his
decision
even
at
the
expense
of
breaking
bounds
and
the
risk
of
being
caught
at
it
he
must
keep
his
appointment
with
joe
bevan
it
would
mean
going
to
the
town
for
a
boat
thereby
breaking
bounds
twice
over
but
it
would
have
to
be
done
ix
sheen
begins
his
education
the
blue
boar
was
a
picturesque
inn
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
river
severn
it
was
much
frequented
in
the
summer
by
fishermen
who
spent
their
days
in
punts
and
their
evenings
in
the
old
oak
parlour
where
a
picture
in
boxing
costume
of
mr
joe
bevan
whose
brother
was
the
landlord
of
the
inn
gazed
austerely
down
on
them
as
if
he
disapproved
of
the
lamentable
want
of
truth
displayed
by
the
majority
of
their
number
artists
also
congregated
there
to
paint
the
porch
at
the
back
of
the
house
were
bedrooms
to
which
the
fishermen
would
make
their
way
in
the
small
hours
of
a
summer
morning
arguing
to
the
last
as
they
stumbled
upstairs
one
of
these
bedrooms
larger
than
the
others
had
been
converted
into
a
gymnasium
for
the
use
of
mine
host
brother
thither
he
brought
pugilistic
aspirants
who
wished
to
be
trained
for
various
contests
and
it
was
the
boast
of
the
blue
boar
that
it
had
never
turned
out
a
loser
a
reputation
of
this
kind
is
a
valuable
asset
to
an
inn
and
the
boxing
world
thought
highly
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
off
the
beaten
track
certainly
the
luck
of
the
blue
boar
had
been
surprising
sheen
pulled
steadily
up
stream
on
the
appointed
day
and
after
half
an
hour
work
found
himself
opposite
the
little
at
the
foot
of
the
inn
lawn
his
journey
had
not
been
free
from
adventure
on
his
way
to
the
town
he
had
almost
run
into
mr
templar
and
but
for
the
lucky
accident
of
that
gentleman
short
sight
must
have
been
discovered
he
had
reached
the
in
safety
but
he
had
not
felt
comfortable
until
he
was
well
out
of
sight
of
the
town
it
was
fortunate
for
him
in
the
present
case
that
he
was
being
left
so
severely
alone
by
the
school
it
was
an
advantage
that
nobody
took
the
least
interest
in
his
goings
and
comings
having
moored
his
boat
and
proceeded
to
the
inn
he
was
directed
upstairs
by
the
landlord
who
was
an
enlarged
and
coloured
edition
of
his
brother
from
the
other
side
of
the
gymnasium
door
came
an
unceasing
and
mysterious
shuffling
sound
he
tapped
at
the
door
and
went
in
he
found
himself
in
a
large
airy
room
lit
by
two
windows
and
a
broad
skylight
the
floor
was
covered
with
linoleum
but
it
was
the
furniture
that
first
attracted
his
attention
in
a
farther
corner
of
the
room
was
a
circular
wooden
ceiling
supported
by
four
narrow
pillars
from
the
centre
of
this
hung
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
football
to
the
left
suspended
from
a
beam
was
an
enormous
leather
bolster
on
the
floor
underneath
a
table
bearing
several
pairs
of
a
and
some
wooden
was
something
that
looked
like
a
dozen
association
footballs
rolled
into
one
all
the
rest
of
the
room
a
space
some
few
yards
square
was
bare
of
furniture
in
this
space
a
small
youth
with
a
head
of
light
hair
cropped
very
short
was
darting
about
and
ducking
and
hitting
out
with
both
hands
at
nothing
with
such
a
serious
earnest
expression
on
his
face
that
sheen
could
not
help
smiling
on
a
chair
by
one
of
the
windows
mr
joe
bevan
was
sitting
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
as
sheen
entered
the
room
the
earnest
young
man
made
a
sudden
dash
at
him
the
next
moment
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
sort
of
heavy
shower
of
fists
they
whizzed
past
his
ear
flashed
up
from
below
within
an
inch
of
his
nose
and
tapped
him
caressingly
on
the
waistcoat
just
as
the
shower
was
at
its
heaviest
his
assailant
darted
away
again
an
imaginary
blow
ducked
another
and
came
at
him
once
more
none
of
the
blows
struck
him
but
it
was
with
more
than
a
little
pleasure
that
he
heard
joe
bevan
call
time
and
saw
the
active
young
gentleman
sink
panting
into
a
seat
you
and
your
games
francis
said
joe
bevan
reproachfully
this
is
a
young
gentleman
from
the
college
come
for
tuition
gentleman
wo
mind
little
joke
take
it
in
spirit
which
is
meant
said
francis
jerkily
sheen
hastened
to
assure
him
that
he
had
not
been
offended
you
take
your
two
minutes
francis
said
mr
bevan
and
then
have
a
turn
with
the
ball
come
this
way
mr
sheen
come
this
way
mr
sheen
and
i
show
you
where
to
put
on
your
things
sheen
had
brought
his
football
clothes
with
him
he
had
not
put
them
on
for
a
year
that
the
lad
i
was
speaking
of
getting
on
prime
he
is
fit
to
fight
for
his
life
as
the
saying
is
what
was
he
doing
when
i
came
in
oh
he
always
has
three
rounds
like
that
every
day
it
teaches
you
to
get
about
quick
you
try
it
when
you
get
back
mr
sheen
fancy
fighting
me
are
you
sure
i
not
interrupting
you
in
the
middle
of
your
work
asked
sheen
not
at
all
sir
not
at
all
i
just
have
to
rub
him
down
and
give
him
his
and
then
he
finished
for
the
day
having
donned
his
football
clothes
and
returned
to
the
gymnasium
sheen
found
francis
in
a
chair
having
his
left
leg
vigorously
rubbed
by
mr
bevan
you
fon
of
dargs
inquired
francis
affably
looking
up
as
he
came
in
sheen
replied
that
he
was
and
indeed
was
possessed
of
one
the
admission
stimulated
francis
whose
right
leg
was
now
under
treatment
to
a
flood
of
conversation
he
it
appeared
had
always
been
one
for
dargs
owned
two
answering
to
the
names
of
tim
and
tom
beggars
for
rats
yes
and
plucked
well
he
would
like
to
see
would
francis
a
dog
that
tim
or
tom
would
not
stand
up
to
clever
too
why
once
joe
bevan
cut
his
soliloquy
short
at
this
point
by
leading
him
off
to
another
room
for
his
but
before
he
went
he
expressed
a
desire
to
talk
further
with
sheen
on
the
subject
of
dogs
and
learning
that
sheen
would
be
there
every
day
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
he
added
that
for
a
brother
he
did
not
mind
stretching
a
point
so
that
if
ever
sheen
wanted
a
couple
of
rounds
any
day
he
francis
would
see
that
he
got
them
this
offer
it
may
be
mentioned
sheen
accepted
with
gratitude
and
the
extra
practice
he
acquired
thereby
was
subsequently
of
the
utmost
use
to
him
francis
as
a
boxer
excelled
in
what
is
known
in
pugilistic
circles
as
shiftiness
that
is
to
say
he
had
a
number
of
ingenious
ways
of
escaping
out
of
tight
corners
and
these
he
taught
sheen
much
to
the
latter
profit
but
this
was
later
when
the
wrykinian
had
passed
those
preliminary
stages
on
which
he
was
now
to
embark
the
art
of
teaching
boxing
really
well
is
a
gift
and
it
is
given
to
but
a
few
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
personal
magnetism
and
above
all
sympathy
a
man
may
be
a
fine
boxer
himself
up
to
every
move
of
the
game
and
a
champion
of
champions
but
for
all
that
he
may
not
be
a
good
teacher
if
he
has
not
the
sympathy
necessary
for
the
appreciation
of
the
difficulties
experienced
by
the
beginner
he
can
not
produce
good
results
a
boxing
instructor
needs
three
qualities
skill
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
joe
bevan
had
all
three
particularly
enthusiasm
his
heart
was
in
his
work
and
he
carried
sheen
with
him
beautiful
sir
beautiful
he
kept
saying
as
he
guarded
the
blows
and
sheen
though
too
clever
to
be
wholly
deceived
by
the
praise
for
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
his
efforts
up
to
the
present
had
been
anything
but
beautiful
was
nevertheless
encouraged
and
put
all
he
knew
into
his
hits
occasionally
joe
bevan
would
push
out
his
left
glove
then
if
sheen
guard
was
in
the
proper
place
and
the
push
did
not
reach
its
destination
joe
would
mutter
a
word
of
praise
if
sheen
dropped
his
right
hand
so
that
he
failed
to
stop
the
blow
bevan
would
observe
keep
that
guard
up
sir
with
almost
a
pained
intonation
as
if
he
had
been
disappointed
in
a
friend
the
constant
repetition
of
this
maxim
gradually
drove
it
into
head
so
that
towards
the
end
of
the
lesson
he
no
longer
lowered
his
right
hand
when
he
led
with
his
left
and
he
felt
the
gentle
pressure
of
joe
bevan
glove
less
frequently
at
no
stage
of
a
education
did
joe
bevan
hit
him
really
hard
and
in
the
first
few
lessons
he
could
scarcely
be
said
to
hit
him
at
all
he
merely
rested
his
glove
against
the
pupil
face
on
the
other
hand
he
was
urgent
in
imploring
the
pupil
to
hit
as
hard
as
he
could
do
be
too
kind
sir
he
would
chant
i
do
mind
being
hit
let
me
have
it
do
flap
put
it
in
with
some
weight
behind
it
he
was
also
fond
of
mentioning
that
extract
from
polonius
speech
to
laertes
which
he
had
quoted
to
sheen
on
their
first
meeting
sheen
finished
his
first
lesson
feeling
hotter
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
hullo
sir
you
out
of
condition
commented
mr
bevan
have
a
bit
of
a
rest
once
more
sheen
had
learnt
the
lesson
of
his
weakness
he
could
hardly
realise
that
he
had
only
begun
to
despise
himself
in
the
last
fortnight
before
then
he
had
been
on
the
whole
satisfied
with
himself
he
was
brilliant
at
work
and
would
certainly
get
a
scholarship
at
oxford
or
cambridge
when
the
time
came
and
he
had
specialised
in
work
to
the
exclusion
of
games
it
is
bad
to
specialise
in
games
to
the
exclusion
of
work
but
of
the
two
courses
the
latter
is
probably
the
less
injurious
one
gains
at
least
health
by
it
but
sheen
now
understood
thoroughly
what
he
ought
to
have
learned
from
his
study
of
the
classics
that
the
happy
mean
was
the
thing
at
which
to
strive
and
for
the
future
he
meant
to
aim
at
it
he
would
get
the
gotford
if
he
could
but
also
would
he
win
the
house
boxing
at
his
weight
after
he
had
rested
he
discovered
the
use
of
the
big
ball
beneath
the
table
it
was
soft
but
solid
and
heavy
by
throwing
this
the
as
they
call
it
in
the
profession
at
joe
bevan
and
catching
it
sheen
made
himself
very
hot
again
and
did
the
muscles
of
his
shoulders
a
great
deal
of
good
that
do
for
today
then
sir
said
joe
bevan
have
a
good
rub
down
tonight
or
you
find
yourself
very
stiff
in
the
morning
well
do
you
think
i
shall
be
any
good
asked
sheen
you
do
fine
sir
but
remember
what
shakespeare
says
about
vaulting
ambition
no
sir
no
i
meant
what
hamlet
says
to
the
players
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
what
you
got
to
remember
in
boxing
sir
take
it
easy
easy
and
cool
does
it
and
the
straight
left
beats
the
world
sheen
paddled
quietly
back
to
the
town
with
the
stream
pondering
over
this
advice
he
felt
that
he
had
advanced
another
step
he
was
not
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
he
knew
anything
about
boxing
as
yet
but
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
did
x
sheen
progress
sheen
improved
he
took
to
boxing
as
he
had
taken
to
fives
he
found
that
his
fives
helped
him
he
could
get
about
on
his
feet
quickly
and
his
eye
was
trained
to
rapid
work
his
second
lesson
was
not
encouraging
he
found
that
he
had
learned
just
enough
to
make
him
stiff
and
awkward
and
no
more
but
he
kept
on
and
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
joe
bevan
declared
definitely
that
he
would
do
that
he
had
the
root
of
the
matter
in
him
and
now
required
only
practice
i
wish
you
could
see
like
i
can
how
you
improving
he
said
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
lesson
as
they
were
resting
after
five
exercise
with
the
i
get
four
blows
in
on
some
of
the
gentlemen
i
teach
to
one
what
i
get
in
on
you
but
it
like
riding
when
you
can
trot
you
look
forward
to
when
you
can
gallop
and
when
you
can
gallop
you
ca
see
yourself
getting
on
any
further
but
you
improving
all
the
time
but
i
ca
gallop
yet
said
sheen
well
no
not
gallop
exactly
but
you
only
had
six
lessons
why
in
another
six
weeks
if
you
come
regular
you
wo
know
yourself
be
making
some
of
the
young
gentlemen
at
the
college
wish
they
had
never
been
born
you
make
babies
of
them
that
what
you
do
i
bet
i
could
if
i
learnt
with
some
one
else
said
sheen
sincerely
i
do
believe
i
should
have
learnt
a
thing
if
i
gone
to
the
school
instructor
who
is
your
school
instructor
sir
a
man
named
jenkins
he
used
to
be
in
the
army
well
there
you
see
that
what
it
is
i
know
old
george
jenkins
he
used
to
be
a
pretty
good
boxer
in
his
time
but
there
boxing
a
thing
like
everything
else
that
moves
with
the
times
we
used
to
go
about
in
iron
trucks
now
we
go
in
just
the
same
with
boxing
what
you
learning
now
is
the
sort
of
boxing
that
wins
championship
fights
nowadays
old
george
well
he
teaches
you
how
to
put
your
left
out
but
my
golly
he
does
know
any
tricks
he
studied
it
same
as
i
have
it
the
that
wins
battles
now
sir
if
you
ready
they
put
on
the
gloves
again
when
the
round
was
over
mr
bevan
had
further
comments
to
make
you
do
hit
hard
enough
sir
he
said
do
flap
let
it
come
straight
out
with
some
weight
behind
it
you
want
to
be
earnest
in
the
ring
the
other
man
going
to
do
his
best
to
hurt
you
and
you
got
to
stop
him
one
good
punch
is
worth
twenty
taps
you
hit
him
and
when
you
hit
him
do
you
go
back
you
hit
him
again
they
only
give
you
three
rounds
in
any
competition
you
go
in
for
so
you
want
to
do
the
work
you
can
while
you
at
it
as
the
days
went
by
sheen
began
to
imbibe
some
of
joe
bevan
rugged
philosophy
of
life
he
began
to
understand
that
the
world
is
a
place
where
every
man
has
to
look
after
himself
and
that
it
is
the
stronger
hand
that
wins
that
sentence
from
which
joe
bevan
was
so
fond
of
quoting
practically
summed
up
the
whole
duty
of
man
and
boy
too
one
should
not
seek
quarrels
but
being
in
one
should
do
best
to
ensure
that
one
opponent
thought
twice
in
future
before
seeking
them
these
afternoons
at
the
blue
boar
were
gradually
giving
sheen
what
he
had
never
before
possessed
he
was
beginning
to
find
that
he
was
capable
of
something
after
all
that
in
an
emergency
he
would
be
able
to
keep
his
end
up
the
feeling
added
a
zest
to
all
that
he
did
his
work
in
school
improved
he
looked
at
the
gotford
no
longer
as
a
prize
which
he
would
have
to
struggle
to
win
he
felt
that
his
rivals
would
have
to
struggle
to
win
it
from
him
after
his
twelfth
lesson
when
he
had
learned
the
of
the
art
and
had
begun
to
develop
a
style
of
his
own
like
some
nervous
batsman
at
cricket
who
does
not
show
his
true
form
till
he
has
been
at
the
wickets
for
several
overs
the
francis
gave
him
a
trial
this
was
a
very
different
affair
from
his
spars
with
joe
bevan
frank
hunt
was
one
of
the
cleverest
boxers
at
his
weight
in
england
but
he
had
not
joe
bevan
gift
of
hitting
gently
he
probably
imagined
that
he
was
merely
tapping
and
certainly
his
blows
were
not
to
be
compared
with
those
he
delivered
in
the
exercise
of
his
professional
duties
but
nevertheless
sheen
had
never
felt
anything
so
painful
before
not
even
in
his
passage
of
arms
with
albert
he
came
out
of
the
encounter
with
a
swollen
lip
and
a
feeling
that
one
of
his
ribs
was
broken
and
he
had
not
had
the
pleasure
of
landing
a
single
blow
upon
his
slippery
antagonist
who
flowed
about
the
room
like
quicksilver
but
he
had
not
flinched
and
the
statement
of
francis
as
they
shook
hands
that
he
had
done
varry
well
was
as
balm
boxing
is
one
of
the
few
sports
where
the
loser
can
feel
the
same
thrill
of
triumph
as
the
winner
there
is
no
satisfaction
equal
to
that
which
comes
when
one
has
forced
oneself
to
go
through
an
ordeal
from
which
one
would
have
liked
to
have
escaped
capital
sir
capital
said
joe
bevan
i
wanted
to
see
whether
you
would
lay
down
or
not
when
you
began
to
get
a
few
punches
you
did
capitally
mr
sheen
i
did
hit
him
much
said
sheen
with
a
laugh
never
mind
sir
you
got
hit
which
was
just
as
good
some
of
the
gentlemen
i
taught
would
have
taken
half
that
they
all
right
when
they
on
top
and
winning
and
to
see
them
shape
you
say
to
yourself
by
george
here
a
champion
but
let
get
a
punch
or
two
and
hullo
says
you
what
this
they
do
like
it
they
lay
down
but
you
kept
on
there
one
thing
though
you
want
to
keep
that
guard
up
when
you
duck
you
slip
him
that
way
once
very
well
next
time
waiting
for
you
he
does
hit
straight
he
hooks
you
and
you
want
many
of
those
sheen
enjoyed
his
surreptitious
visits
to
the
blue
boar
twice
he
escaped
being
caught
in
the
most
sensational
way
and
once
mr
spence
who
looked
after
the
wrykyn
cricket
and
gymnasium
and
played
everything
equally
well
nearly
caused
complications
by
inviting
sheen
to
play
fives
with
him
after
school
fortunately
the
gotford
afforded
an
excellent
excuse
as
the
time
for
the
examination
drew
near
those
who
had
entered
for
it
were
accustomed
to
become
hermits
to
a
great
extent
and
to
retire
after
school
to
work
in
their
studies
you
must
overdo
it
sheen
said
mr
spence
you
ought
to
get
some
exercise
oh
i
do
sir
said
sheen
i
still
play
fives
but
i
play
before
breakfast
now
he
had
had
one
or
two
games
with
harrington
of
the
school
house
who
did
not
care
particularly
whom
he
played
with
so
long
as
his
opponent
was
a
useful
man
sheen
being
one
of
the
few
players
in
the
school
who
were
up
to
his
form
harrington
ignored
the
cloud
under
which
sheen
rested
when
they
met
in
the
world
outside
the
harrington
was
polite
but
made
no
overtures
of
friendship
that
it
may
be
mentioned
was
the
attitude
of
every
one
who
did
not
actually
cut
sheen
the
exception
was
jack
bruce
who
had
constituted
himself
audience
to
sheen
when
the
latter
was
practising
the
piano
on
two
further
occasions
but
then
bruce
was
so
silent
by
nature
that
for
all
practical
purposes
he
might
just
as
well
have
cut
sheen
like
the
others
we
might
have
a
game
before
breakfast
some
time
then
said
mr
spence
he
had
noticed
being
a
master
who
did
notice
things
that
sheen
appeared
to
have
few
friends
and
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
try
and
bring
him
out
a
little
of
the
real
facts
of
the
case
he
knew
of
course
nothing
i
should
like
to
sir
said
sheen
next
wednesday
all
right
sir
i
be
there
at
seven
if
you
before
me
you
might
get
the
second
court
will
you
the
second
court
from
the
end
nearest
the
was
the
best
of
the
at
wrykyn
after
school
sometimes
you
would
see
fags
racing
across
the
gravel
to
appropriate
it
for
their
masters
the
rule
was
that
whoever
first
pinned
to
the
door
a
piece
of
paper
with
his
name
on
it
was
the
legal
owner
of
the
court
and
it
was
a
stirring
sight
to
see
a
dozen
fags
fighting
to
get
at
the
door
but
before
breakfast
the
court
might
be
had
with
less
trouble
meanwhile
sheen
paid
his
daily
visits
to
the
blue
boar
losing
flesh
and
gaining
toughness
with
every
lesson
the
more
he
saw
of
joe
bevan
the
more
he
liked
him
and
appreciated
his
strong
simple
outlook
on
life
shakespeare
was
a
great
bond
between
them
sheen
had
always
been
a
student
of
the
bard
and
he
and
joe
would
sit
on
the
little
verandah
of
the
inn
looking
over
the
river
until
it
was
time
for
him
to
row
back
to
the
town
quoting
passages
at
one
another
joe
knowledge
of
the
plays
especially
the
tragedies
was
wide
and
at
first
inexplicable
to
sheen
it
was
strange
to
hear
him
declaiming
long
speeches
from
or
and
to
think
that
he
was
by
profession
a
pugilist
one
evening
he
explained
his
curious
erudition
in
his
youth
before
he
took
to
the
ring
in
earnest
he
had
travelled
with
a
shakespearean
repertory
company
i
never
played
a
star
part
he
confessed
but
i
used
to
come
on
in
the
battle
of
bosworth
and
in
macbeth
castle
and
what
not
i
been
first
citizen
sometimes
i
was
the
carpenter
in
that
was
my
biggest
part
sir
in
respect
of
a
fine
workman
i
am
but
as
you
would
say
a
cobbler
but
somehow
the
stage
well
know
what
it
is
sir
leeds
one
week
manchester
the
next
brighton
the
week
after
and
travelling
all
sunday
it
was
quiet
enough
for
me
the
idea
of
becoming
a
professional
pugilist
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quiet
tickled
sheen
but
i
always
read
shakespeare
ever
since
then
continued
mr
bevan
and
i
always
shall
read
him
it
was
on
the
next
day
that
mr
bevan
made
a
suggestion
which
drew
confidences
from
sheen
in
his
turn
what
you
want
now
sir
he
said
is
to
practise
on
someone
of
about
your
own
form
as
the
saying
is
is
there
some
gentleman
friend
of
yours
at
the
college
who
would
come
here
with
you
they
were
sitting
on
the
verandah
when
he
asked
this
question
it
was
growing
dusk
and
the
evening
seemed
to
invite
confidences
sheen
looking
out
across
the
river
and
avoiding
his
friend
glance
explained
just
what
it
was
that
made
it
so
difficult
for
him
to
produce
a
gentleman
friend
at
that
particular
time
he
could
feel
mr
eye
upon
him
but
he
went
through
with
it
till
the
thing
was
told
boldly
and
with
no
attempt
to
smooth
over
any
of
the
unpleasant
points
never
you
mind
sir
said
mr
bevan
consolingly
as
he
finished
we
all
lose
our
heads
sometimes
i
seen
the
way
you
stand
up
to
francis
and
i
eat
i
eat
the
if
you
not
as
plucky
as
anyone
it
simply
a
question
of
keeping
your
head
you
would
do
a
thing
like
that
again
not
you
do
you
worry
yourself
sir
we
all
alike
when
we
get
bustled
we
do
know
what
doing
and
by
the
time
we
put
our
hands
up
and
got
into
shape
why
it
all
over
and
there
you
are
do
you
worry
yourself
sir
you
an
awfully
good
sort
joe
said
sheen
gratefully
xi
a
small
incident
failing
a
gentleman
friend
mr
bevan
was
obliged
to
do
what
he
could
by
means
of
local
talent
on
sheen
next
visit
he
was
introduced
to
a
burly
youth
of
his
own
age
very
taciturn
and
apparently
ferocious
he
it
seemed
was
the
knife
and
boot
boy
at
the
blue
boar
did
a
bit
with
the
gloves
and
was
willing
to
spar
with
sheen
provided
mr
bevan
made
it
all
right
with
the
saw
that
is
so
say
that
he
did
not
get
into
trouble
for
passing
in
unprofessional
frivolity
moments
which
should
have
been
sacred
to
knives
and
boots
these
terms
having
been
agreed
to
he
put
on
the
gloves
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
begun
his
lessons
sheen
experienced
an
attack
of
his
old
shyness
and
dislike
of
hurting
other
feelings
he
could
not
resist
the
thought
that
he
had
no
grudge
against
the
warden
of
the
knives
and
boots
he
hardly
liked
to
hit
him
the
other
however
did
not
share
this
prejudice
he
rushed
at
sheen
with
such
determination
that
almost
the
first
warning
the
latter
had
that
the
contest
had
begun
was
the
collision
of
the
back
of
his
head
with
the
wall
out
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
did
better
and
was
beginning
to
hold
his
own
in
spite
of
a
rousing
thump
on
his
left
eye
when
joe
bevan
called
time
a
second
round
went
off
in
much
the
same
way
his
guard
was
more
often
in
the
right
place
and
his
leads
less
wild
at
the
conclusion
of
the
round
pressure
of
business
forced
his
opponent
to
depart
and
sheen
wound
up
his
lesson
with
a
couple
of
minutes
at
the
on
the
whole
he
was
pleased
with
his
first
spar
with
someone
who
was
really
doing
his
best
and
trying
to
hurt
him
with
joe
bevan
and
francis
there
was
always
the
feeling
that
they
were
playing
down
to
him
joe
bevan
gentle
taps
in
particular
were
a
little
humiliating
but
with
his
late
opponent
all
had
been
serious
it
had
been
a
real
test
and
he
had
come
through
it
very
fairly
on
the
whole
he
had
taken
more
than
he
had
given
his
eye
would
look
curious
tomorrow
but
already
he
had
thought
out
a
way
of
foiling
the
burly
youth
rushes
next
time
he
would
really
show
his
true
form
the
morrow
on
which
sheen
expected
his
eye
to
look
curious
was
the
day
he
had
promised
to
play
fives
with
mr
spence
he
hoped
that
at
the
early
hour
at
which
they
had
arranged
to
play
it
would
not
have
reached
its
worst
stage
but
when
he
looked
in
the
glass
at
a
quarter
to
seven
he
beheld
a
small
ridge
of
purple
beneath
it
it
was
not
large
nor
did
it
interfere
with
his
sight
but
it
was
very
visible
mr
spence
however
was
a
sportsman
and
had
boxed
himself
in
his
time
so
there
was
a
chance
that
nothing
would
be
said
it
was
a
raw
drizzly
morning
there
would
probably
be
few
before
breakfast
and
the
capture
of
the
second
court
should
be
easy
so
it
turned
out
nobody
was
about
when
sheen
arrived
he
pinned
his
slip
of
paper
to
the
door
and
after
waiting
for
a
short
while
for
mr
spence
and
finding
the
process
chilly
went
for
a
trot
round
the
gymnasium
to
pass
the
time
mr
spence
had
not
arrived
during
his
absence
but
somebody
else
had
at
the
door
of
the
second
court
gleaming
in
blazer
sweater
stockings
and
stood
attell
sheen
looked
at
attell
and
attell
looked
through
sheen
it
was
curious
thought
sheen
that
attell
should
be
standing
in
the
very
doorway
of
court
two
it
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
claimed
some
sort
of
ownership
on
the
other
hand
there
was
his
sheen
paper
on
the
his
eye
happened
to
light
on
the
cement
flooring
in
front
of
the
court
there
was
a
crumpled
ball
of
paper
there
when
he
had
started
for
his
run
there
had
been
no
such
ball
of
paper
sheen
picked
it
up
and
straightened
it
out
on
it
was
written
sheen
he
looked
up
quickly
in
addition
to
the
look
attell
face
now
wore
a
faint
smile
as
if
he
had
seen
something
rather
funny
on
the
horizon
but
he
spake
no
word
a
curiously
calm
and
contented
feeling
came
upon
sheen
here
was
something
definite
at
last
he
could
do
nothing
however
much
he
might
resent
it
when
fellows
passed
him
by
as
if
he
did
not
exist
but
when
it
came
to
removing
his
landmark
would
you
mind
shifting
a
bit
he
said
very
politely
i
want
to
pin
my
paper
on
the
door
again
it
seems
to
have
fallen
down
attell
gaze
shifted
slowly
from
the
horizon
and
gradually
embraced
sheen
i
got
this
court
he
said
i
think
not
said
sheen
silkily
i
was
here
at
ten
to
seven
and
there
was
no
paper
on
the
door
then
so
i
put
mine
up
if
you
move
a
little
i
put
it
up
again
go
and
find
another
court
if
you
want
to
play
said
attell
and
if
you
got
anybody
to
play
with
he
added
with
a
sneer
this
is
mine
i
think
not
said
sheen
attell
resumed
his
inspection
of
the
horizon
attell
said
sheen
attell
did
not
answer
sheen
pushed
him
gently
out
of
the
way
and
tore
down
the
paper
from
the
door
their
eyes
met
attell
after
a
moment
pause
came
forward
half
irresolute
and
as
he
came
sheen
hit
him
under
the
chin
in
the
manner
recommended
by
mr
bevan
when
you
mr
bevan
was
wont
to
say
do
make
it
a
swing
just
a
jolt
all
you
want
it
was
certainly
all
attell
wanted
he
was
more
than
surprised
he
was
petrified
the
sudden
shock
of
the
blow
coming
as
it
did
from
so
unexpected
a
quarter
deprived
him
of
speech
which
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
him
for
what
he
would
have
said
would
hardly
have
commended
itself
to
mr
spence
who
came
up
at
this
moment
well
sheen
said
mr
spence
here
you
are
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
what
a
morning
you
got
the
court
i
hope
yes
sir
said
sheen
he
wondered
if
the
master
had
seen
the
little
episode
which
had
taken
place
immediately
before
his
arrival
then
he
remembered
that
it
had
happened
inside
the
court
it
must
have
been
over
by
the
time
mr
spence
had
come
upon
the
scene
are
you
waiting
for
somebody
attell
asked
mr
spence
stanning
he
will
be
here
directly
i
passed
him
on
the
way
attell
left
the
court
and
they
began
their
game
you
hurt
your
eye
sheen
said
mr
spence
at
the
end
of
the
first
game
how
did
that
happen
boxing
sir
said
sheen
oh
replied
mr
spence
and
to
sheen
relief
he
did
not
pursue
his
inquiries
attell
had
wandered
out
across
the
gravel
to
meet
stanning
got
that
court
inquired
stanning
no
you
idiot
why
on
earth
did
you
it
the
only
court
worth
playing
in
who
got
it
sheen
sheen
stanning
stopped
dead
do
you
mean
to
say
you
let
a
fool
like
sheen
take
it
from
you
why
did
you
turn
him
out
i
could
said
attell
i
was
just
going
to
when
spence
came
up
he
playing
sheen
this
morning
i
could
very
well
bag
the
court
when
a
master
wanted
it
i
suppose
not
said
stanning
what
did
sheen
say
when
you
told
him
you
wanted
the
court
this
was
getting
near
a
phase
of
the
subject
which
attell
was
not
eager
to
discuss
oh
he
did
say
much
he
said
did
you
do
anything
persisted
stanning
attell
suddenly
remembered
having
noticed
that
sheen
was
wearing
a
black
eye
this
was
obviously
a
thing
to
be
turned
to
account
i
hit
him
in
the
eye
he
said
i
bet
it
coloured
by
and
sure
enough
when
arrived
there
was
sheen
with
his
face
in
the
condition
described
and
stanning
hastened
to
spread
abroad
this
sequel
to
the
story
of
sheen
failings
in
the
town
battle
by
the
end
of
preparation
it
had
got
about
the
school
that
sheen
had
cheeked
attell
that
attell
had
hit
sheen
and
that
sheen
had
been
afraid
to
hit
him
back
at
the
precise
moment
when
sheen
was
in
the
middle
of
a
warm
round
with
francis
at
the
blue
boar
an
indignation
meeting
was
being
held
in
the
senior
at
seymour
to
discuss
this
latest
disgrace
to
the
house
this
is
getting
a
bit
too
thick
was
the
general
opinion
moreover
it
was
universally
agreed
that
something
ought
to
be
done
the
feeling
in
the
house
against
sheen
had
been
stirred
to
a
dangerous
pitch
by
this
last
episode
seymour
thought
more
of
their
reputation
than
any
house
in
the
school
for
years
past
the
house
had
led
on
the
cricket
and
football
field
and
off
it
sometimes
other
houses
would
actually
win
one
of
the
cups
but
when
this
happened
seymour
was
always
their
most
dangerous
rival
other
houses
had
their
ups
and
downs
were
very
good
one
year
and
very
bad
the
next
but
seymour
had
always
managed
to
maintain
a
steady
level
of
excellence
it
always
had
a
man
or
two
in
the
school
eleven
and
fifteen
generally
supplied
one
of
the
school
racquets
pair
for
queen
club
in
the
easter
and
when
this
did
not
happen
always
had
one
of
two
of
the
gym
six
or
shooting
eight
or
a
few
men
who
had
won
scholarships
at
the
the
pride
of
a
house
is
almost
keener
than
the
pride
of
a
school
from
the
first
minute
he
entered
the
house
a
new
boy
was
made
to
feel
that
in
coming
to
seymour
he
had
accepted
a
responsibility
that
his
reputation
was
not
his
own
but
belonged
to
the
house
if
he
did
well
the
glory
would
be
seymour
glory
if
he
did
badly
he
would
be
sinning
against
the
house
this
second
story
about
sheen
therefore
stirred
seymour
to
the
extent
of
giving
the
house
a
resemblance
to
a
hornet
nest
into
which
a
stone
had
been
hurled
after
school
that
day
the
house
literally
hummed
the
noise
of
the
two
talking
it
over
could
be
heard
in
the
road
outside
the
only
bar
that
stood
between
the
outraged
seymourites
and
sheen
was
drummond
as
had
happened
before
drummond
resolutely
refused
to
allow
anything
in
the
shape
of
an
active
protest
and
no
argument
would
draw
him
from
this
unreasonable
attitude
though
why
it
was
that
he
had
taken
it
up
he
himself
could
not
have
said
perhaps
it
was
that
rooted
hatred
a
boxer
instinctively
acquires
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
unfair
play
that
influenced
him
he
revolted
against
the
idea
of
a
whole
house
banding
together
against
one
of
its
members
so
even
this
fresh
provocation
did
not
result
in
any
active
interference
with
sheen
but
it
was
decided
that
he
must
be
cut
even
more
thoroughly
than
before
and
about
the
time
when
this
was
resolved
sheen
was
receiving
the
congratulations
of
francis
on
having
positively
landed
a
blow
upon
him
it
was
an
event
which
marked
an
epoch
in
his
career
xii
dunstable
and
linton
go
up
the
river
there
are
some
proud
spirited
natures
which
resent
rules
and
laws
on
principle
as
attempts
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
citizen
as
the
duchess
in
the
play
said
of
her
son
who
had
had
unpleasantness
with
the
authorities
at
eton
because
they
had
been
trying
to
teach
him
things
silwood
is
a
sweet
boy
but
he
will
not
stand
the
dunstable
was
also
a
sweet
boy
but
he
too
objected
to
the
and
linton
was
a
sweet
boy
and
he
had
similar
prejudices
and
this
placing
of
the
town
out
of
bounds
struck
both
of
them
simultaneously
as
a
distinct
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
headmaster
to
apply
the
it
all
very
well
to
put
it
out
of
bounds
for
the
kids
said
dunstable
firmly
but
when
it
comes
to
us
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
linton
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
such
conduct
was
quite
in
a
class
of
its
own
as
regarded
cool
cheek
it
fairly
sneaks
said
linton
with
forced
calm
the
garibaldi
kids
proceeded
dunstable
judicially
are
idiots
and
ca
be
expected
to
behave
themselves
down
town
put
the
show
out
of
bounds
to
them
if
you
like
but
we
we
echoed
linton
the
fact
is
said
dunstable
it
a
beastly
nuisance
but
we
shall
have
to
go
down
town
and
up
the
river
just
to
assert
ourselves
we
ca
have
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
coming
and
spoiling
our
liberties
we
may
as
well
chuck
life
altogether
if
we
are
able
to
go
to
the
town
whenever
we
like
and
albert
will
be
pining
away
added
linton
hullo
young
gentlemen
said
the
town
boatman
when
they
presented
themselves
to
him
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
know
it
seems
strange
said
dunstable
but
we
want
a
boat
we
are
the
british
schoolboys
league
for
demanding
liberty
and
seeing
that
we
get
it
have
you
a
boat
the
man
said
he
believed
he
had
a
boat
in
fact
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
rather
fancied
he
had
one
or
two
he
proceeded
to
get
one
ready
and
the
two
martyrs
to
the
cause
stepped
in
dunstable
settled
himself
in
the
stern
and
collected
the
hullo
said
linton
are
you
going
to
row
it
may
be
only
my
foolish
fancy
replied
dunstable
but
i
rather
think
you
going
to
do
that
i
steer
beastly
slacker
said
linton
anyhow
how
far
are
we
going
i
not
going
to
pull
all
night
if
you
row
for
about
half
an
hour
without
exerting
yourself
and
i
can
trust
you
not
to
do
that
and
then
look
to
your
left
you
see
a
certain
hostelry
if
it
has
moved
since
i
was
last
there
called
the
boar
we
will
have
tea
there
and
then
i
pull
gently
back
and
that
will
end
the
programme
except
being
caught
in
the
town
by
half
the
masters
said
linton
still
i
not
grumbling
this
had
to
be
done
ready
not
just
yet
said
dunstable
looking
past
linton
and
up
the
wait
just
one
second
here
are
some
friends
of
ours
linton
looked
over
his
shoulder
albert
he
cried
and
the
who
struck
me
divers
blows
in
sundry
places
ah
they
sighted
us
what
are
you
going
to
do
we
ca
have
another
scrap
with
them
far
from
it
said
dunstable
gently
hullo
albert
my
friend
in
the
bowler
this
is
well
met
you
come
out
here
said
albert
pausing
on
the
brink
why
asked
dunstable
you
see
what
you
get
but
we
do
want
to
see
what
we
get
you
got
such
a
narrow
mind
albert
may
i
call
you
bertie
you
seem
to
think
that
nobody
has
any
pleasures
except
vulgar
brawls
we
are
going
to
row
up
river
and
think
beautiful
thoughts
albert
was
measuring
with
his
eye
the
distance
between
the
boat
and
it
was
not
far
a
sudden
spring
if
you
want
a
fight
go
up
to
the
school
and
ask
for
mr
drummond
the
gentlemen
who
sent
you
to
hospital
last
time
any
time
passing
i
sure
he
albert
leaped
but
linton
had
had
him
under
observation
and
as
he
sprung
pushed
vigorously
with
his
oar
the
gap
between
boat
and
shore
widened
in
an
instant
and
albert
failing
to
obtain
a
foothold
on
the
boat
fell
back
with
a
splash
that
sent
a
cascade
over
his
friend
and
the
boatman
into
three
feet
of
muddy
water
by
the
time
he
had
scrambled
out
his
enemies
were
moving
pensively
the
boatman
was
annoyed
makin
me
wet
and
spoilin
my
paint
what
yer
mean
by
it
me
and
my
friend
here
we
want
a
boat
said
albert
ignoring
the
main
issue
want
a
boat
then
you
not
get
a
boat
spoil
my
cushions
too
would
you
what
next
i
wonder
you
go
to
smith
and
ask
for
a
boat
perhaps
he
ai
so
particular
about
having
his
cushions
orl
right
said
albert
right
mr
smith
proved
more
complaisant
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
dunstable
and
linton
had
disappeared
albert
and
his
friend
were
on
the
water
moist
outside
albert
burned
with
a
desire
for
revenge
he
meant
to
follow
his
men
till
he
found
them
it
almost
seemed
as
if
there
would
be
a
repetition
of
the
naval
battle
which
had
caused
the
town
to
be
put
out
of
bounds
albert
was
a
youth
and
he
had
swallowed
fully
a
pint
of
severn
water
dunstable
and
linton
sat
for
some
time
in
the
oak
parlour
of
the
blue
boar
it
was
late
when
they
went
out
as
they
reached
the
water
edge
linton
uttered
a
cry
of
consternation
what
up
asked
dunstable
i
wish
you
would
do
that
so
suddenly
it
gives
me
a
start
do
you
feel
bad
great
scott
it
gone
the
pain
our
boat
i
tied
it
up
to
this
post
you
ca
have
done
what
that
boat
over
there
that
looks
like
ours
no
it
is
that
was
there
when
we
came
i
noticed
it
i
tied
ours
up
here
to
this
post
this
is
a
shade
awkward
said
dunstable
thoughtfully
you
must
have
tied
it
up
jolly
rottenly
it
must
have
slipped
away
and
gone
this
is
where
we
find
ourselves
in
the
cart
right
among
the
ribstons
by
jove
i
feel
like
that
frenchman
in
the
story
who
lost
his
glasses
just
as
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
missed
the
view
altogezzer
i
do
not
vish
i
kom
i
certain
i
tied
it
up
all
right
and
why
look
here
the
rope
still
on
the
pole
just
as
i
left
it
for
the
first
time
dunstable
seemed
interested
this
is
getting
mysterious
did
we
hire
a
or
a
submarine
there
something
on
the
end
of
this
rope
give
it
a
tug
and
see
there
did
you
feel
it
i
do
believe
said
linton
in
an
awed
voice
the
thing
sunk
they
pulled
at
the
rope
together
the
waters
heaved
and
broke
and
up
came
the
nose
of
the
boat
to
sink
back
with
a
splash
as
they
loosened
their
hold
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
said
dunstable
wiping
his
hands
if
you
ask
me
i
should
say
an
enemy
hath
done
this
a
boat
does
sink
of
its
own
accord
albert
said
linton
the
blackguard
must
have
followed
us
up
and
done
it
while
we
were
at
tea
that
about
it
said
dunstable
and
now
how
about
getting
home
i
suppose
we
better
walk
we
shall
be
hours
late
for
you
said
dunstable
may
walk
if
you
are
fond
of
exercise
and
in
a
hurry
personally
i
going
back
by
river
but
that
looks
a
good
enough
boat
over
there
anyhow
we
must
make
it
do
one
must
be
particular
for
once
but
it
belongs
what
will
the
other
fellow
do
i
ca
help
troubles
said
dunstable
mildly
having
enough
of
my
own
coming
it
was
about
ten
minutes
later
that
sheen
approaching
the
waterside
in
quest
of
his
boat
found
no
boat
there
the
time
was
a
quarter
to
six
and
was
at
xiii
deus
ex
machina
it
did
not
occur
to
sheen
immediately
that
his
boat
had
actually
gone
the
full
beauty
of
the
situation
was
some
moments
in
coming
home
to
him
at
first
he
merely
thought
that
somebody
had
moved
it
to
another
part
of
the
bank
as
the
authorities
at
the
inn
had
done
once
or
twice
in
the
past
to
make
room
for
the
boats
of
fresh
visitors
walking
along
the
lawn
in
search
of
it
he
came
upon
the
stake
to
which
dunstable
submerged
craft
was
attached
he
gave
the
rope
a
tentative
pull
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
a
heavy
drag
on
the
end
of
it
then
suddenly
the
truth
flashed
across
him
heavens
he
cried
sunk
joe
bevan
and
other
allies
lent
their
aid
to
the
pulling
the
lost
boat
came
out
of
the
river
like
some
huge
fish
and
finally
rested
on
the
bank
oozing
water
and
drenching
the
grass
in
all
directions
joe
bevan
stooped
down
and
examined
it
in
the
dim
light
what
happened
here
sir
he
said
is
that
there
a
plank
gone
from
the
bottom
smashed
clean
out
it
is
not
started
it
is
smashed
clean
out
that
what
it
is
some
one
must
have
been
here
and
done
it
sheen
looked
at
the
boat
and
saw
that
he
was
right
a
plank
in
the
middle
had
been
splintered
it
looked
as
if
somebody
had
driven
some
heavy
instrument
into
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
albert
had
effected
the
job
with
the
of
an
oar
the
damage
was
not
ruinous
a
carpenter
could
put
the
thing
right
at
no
great
expense
but
it
would
take
time
and
meanwhile
the
minutes
were
flying
and
was
now
little
more
than
half
an
hour
away
what
you
do
sir
asked
bevan
that
was
just
what
sheen
was
asking
himself
what
could
he
do
the
road
to
the
school
twisted
and
turned
to
such
an
extent
that
though
the
distance
from
the
blue
boar
to
seymour
was
only
a
couple
of
miles
as
the
crow
flies
he
would
have
to
cover
double
that
distance
unless
he
took
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
and
if
he
took
a
short
cut
in
the
dark
he
was
certain
to
lose
himself
it
was
a
choice
of
evils
the
blue
boar
possessed
but
one
horse
and
trap
and
he
had
seen
that
driven
away
to
the
station
in
charge
of
a
fisherman
luggage
half
an
hour
before
i
shall
have
to
walk
he
said
it
a
long
way
you
be
late
wo
you
said
mr
bevan
it
ca
be
helped
i
suppose
i
shall
i
wonder
who
smashed
that
boat
he
added
after
a
pause
passing
through
the
inn
on
his
way
to
the
road
he
made
inquiries
it
appeared
that
two
young
gentlemen
from
the
school
had
been
there
to
tea
they
had
arrived
in
a
boat
and
gone
away
in
a
boat
nobody
else
had
come
into
the
inn
suspicion
obviously
rested
upon
them
do
you
remember
anything
about
them
asked
sheen
further
details
came
out
one
of
the
pair
had
worn
a
cap
like
sheen
the
other
headgear
minutely
described
showed
him
that
its
owner
was
a
member
of
the
school
second
eleven
sheen
pursued
the
inquiry
he
would
be
so
late
in
any
case
that
a
minute
or
so
more
or
less
would
make
no
material
difference
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
find
out
if
possible
who
it
was
that
had
placed
him
in
this
difficulty
he
knew
that
he
was
unpopular
in
the
school
but
he
had
not
looked
for
this
sort
of
thing
then
somebody
suddenly
remembered
having
heard
one
of
the
pair
address
the
other
by
name
what
name
asked
sheen
his
informant
was
not
sure
would
it
be
lindon
linton
said
sheen
that
was
it
sheen
thanked
him
and
departed
still
puzzled
linton
as
he
knew
him
was
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
do
a
thing
like
that
and
the
other
the
second
eleven
man
must
be
dunstable
they
were
always
about
together
he
did
not
know
much
about
dunstable
but
he
could
hardly
believe
that
this
sort
of
thing
was
his
form
either
well
he
would
have
to
think
of
that
later
he
must
concentrate
himself
now
on
covering
the
distance
to
the
school
in
the
minimum
of
time
he
looked
at
his
watch
twenty
minutes
more
if
he
hurried
he
might
not
be
so
very
late
he
wished
that
somebody
would
come
by
in
a
cart
and
give
him
a
lift
he
stopped
and
listened
no
sound
of
horse
hoof
broke
the
silence
he
walked
on
again
then
faint
at
first
but
growing
stronger
every
instant
there
came
from
some
point
in
the
road
far
behind
him
a
steady
droning
sound
he
almost
shouted
with
joy
a
motor
even
now
he
might
do
it
but
could
he
stop
it
would
the
motorist
pay
any
attention
to
him
or
would
he
flash
past
and
leave
him
in
the
dust
from
the
rate
at
which
the
drone
increased
the
car
seemed
to
be
travelling
at
a
rare
speed
he
moved
to
one
side
of
the
road
and
waited
he
could
see
the
lights
now
flying
towards
him
then
as
the
car
hummed
past
he
recognised
its
driver
and
put
all
he
knew
into
a
shout
bruce
he
cried
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
been
heard
the
driver
paid
not
the
smallest
attention
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
looked
neither
to
the
left
nor
to
right
then
the
car
slowed
down
and
backing
came
slowly
to
where
he
stood
hullo
said
the
driver
who
that
jack
bruce
was
alone
in
the
car
muffled
to
the
eyes
in
an
overcoat
it
was
more
by
his
general
appearance
than
his
face
that
sheen
had
recognised
him
it
me
sheen
i
say
bruce
i
wish
you
give
me
a
lift
to
seymour
will
you
there
was
never
any
waste
of
words
about
jack
bruce
of
all
the
six
hundred
and
boys
at
wrykyn
he
was
probably
the
only
one
whose
next
remark
in
such
circumstances
would
not
have
been
a
question
bruce
seldom
asked
questions
never
if
they
wasted
time
hop
in
he
said
sheen
consulted
his
watch
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
said
but
they
give
us
ten
minutes
grace
that
allows
us
plenty
of
time
does
it
do
it
in
seven
minutes
if
you
like
do
hurry
said
sheen
i
never
been
in
a
motor
before
and
i
do
want
to
cut
the
experience
short
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
give
me
a
lift
that
all
right
said
bruce
were
you
going
anywhere
am
i
taking
you
out
of
your
way
no
i
was
just
trying
the
car
it
a
new
one
the
pater
just
got
it
do
you
do
much
of
this
said
sheen
good
bit
i
going
in
for
the
motor
business
when
i
leave
school
so
all
this
is
training
that
it
there
was
a
pause
you
seemed
to
be
going
at
a
good
pace
just
now
said
sheen
about
thirty
miles
an
hour
she
can
move
all
right
that
faster
than
you
allowed
to
go
is
it
yes
you
never
been
caught
have
you
not
yet
i
want
to
see
how
much
pace
i
can
get
out
of
her
because
she
be
useful
when
the
election
really
comes
on
bringing
voters
to
the
poll
you
know
that
why
the
pater
bought
this
new
car
it
a
beauty
his
other
only
a
little
runabout
does
your
father
mind
your
motoring
likes
it
said
jack
bruce
it
seemed
to
sheen
that
it
was
about
time
that
he
volunteered
some
information
about
himself
instead
of
plying
his
companion
with
questions
it
was
pleasant
talking
to
a
wrykinian
again
and
jack
bruce
had
apparently
either
not
heard
of
the
albert
incident
or
else
he
was
not
influenced
by
it
in
any
way
you
got
me
out
of
an
awful
hole
bruce
he
began
that
all
right
been
out
for
a
walk
i
been
to
the
boar
oh
said
bruce
he
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
know
why
sheen
had
been
there
sheen
proceeded
to
explain
i
suppose
you
heard
all
about
me
he
said
uncomfortably
about
the
town
you
know
that
fight
not
joining
in
heard
something
about
it
said
bruce
i
went
down
town
again
after
that
said
sheen
and
met
the
same
fellows
who
were
fighting
linton
and
the
others
they
came
for
me
and
i
was
getting
awfully
mauled
when
joe
bevan
turned
up
oh
is
joe
back
again
do
you
know
him
asked
sheen
in
surprise
oh
yes
i
used
to
go
to
the
boar
to
learn
boxing
from
him
all
last
summer
holidays
did
you
really
why
that
what
i
doing
now
good
man
said
bruce
is
he
a
splendid
teacher
ripping
but
i
did
know
you
boxed
bruce
you
never
went
in
for
any
of
the
school
competitions
i
rather
a
rotten
weight
ten
six
too
heavy
for
the
and
not
heavy
enough
for
the
middles
besides
the
competitions
here
are
really
they
do
want
going
in
for
them
are
you
going
to
box
for
seymour
that
what
i
want
to
do
you
see
it
would
be
rather
a
score
would
it
after
what
happened
you
know
i
suppose
it
would
i
should
like
to
do
something
it
not
very
pleasant
he
added
with
a
forced
laugh
being
considered
a
disgrace
to
the
house
and
cut
by
everyone
suppose
not
the
difficulty
is
drummond
you
see
we
are
both
the
same
weight
and
he
much
better
than
i
am
i
hoping
that
he
go
in
for
the
middles
and
let
me
take
the
there
nobody
he
could
beat
in
the
middles
though
he
would
be
giving
away
a
stone
have
you
asked
him
not
yet
i
want
to
keep
it
dark
that
i
learning
to
box
just
at
present
spring
it
on
them
suddenly
yes
of
course
i
ca
let
it
get
about
that
i
go
to
joe
bevan
because
i
have
to
break
bounds
every
time
i
do
it
the
upper
river
out
of
bounds
now
for
boarders
is
it
yes
jack
bruce
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
his
gaze
concentrated
on
the
road
in
front
of
him
why
go
by
river
at
all
he
said
at
last
if
you
like
i
run
you
to
the
boar
in
the
motor
every
day
oh
i
say
that
awfully
decent
of
you
said
sheen
i
should
like
to
see
old
joe
again
i
think
i
come
and
spar
too
if
you
learning
what
you
want
more
than
anything
is
somebody
your
own
size
to
box
with
that
just
what
joe
was
saying
will
you
really
i
should
be
awfully
glad
if
you
would
boxing
with
joe
is
all
right
but
you
feel
all
the
time
he
fooling
with
you
i
should
like
to
try
how
i
got
on
with
somebody
else
you
better
meet
me
here
then
as
soon
after
school
as
you
can
as
he
spoke
the
car
stopped
where
are
we
asked
sheen
just
at
the
corner
of
the
road
behind
the
houses
oh
i
know
hullo
there
goes
the
bell
i
shall
do
it
comfortably
he
jumped
down
i
say
bruce
he
said
i
really
am
most
awfully
obliged
for
the
lift
something
went
wrong
with
my
boat
and
i
could
get
back
in
it
i
should
have
been
frightfully
in
the
cart
if
you
had
come
by
that
all
right
said
jack
bruce
i
say
sheen
hullo
are
you
going
to
practise
in
the
after
morning
school
tomorrow
yes
why
i
think
i
turn
up
i
wish
you
would
what
that
thing
that
goes
like
this
i
forget
most
of
it
he
whistled
a
few
bars
that
a
thing
of
greig
said
sheen
you
might
play
it
tomorrow
said
bruce
rather
of
course
i
will
thanks
said
jack
bruce
good
night
he
turned
the
car
and
vanished
down
the
road
from
the
sound
sheen
judged
that
he
was
once
more
travelling
at
a
higher
rate
of
speed
than
the
local
police
would
have
approved
xiv
a
skirmish
upon
consideration
sheen
determined
to
see
linton
about
that
small
matter
of
the
boat
without
delay
after
prayers
that
night
he
went
to
his
study
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
linton
he
said
linton
was
surprised
he
disapproved
of
this
intrusion
when
a
fellow
is
being
cut
by
the
house
he
ought
by
all
the
laws
of
school
etiquette
to
behave
as
such
and
not
speak
till
he
is
spoken
to
what
do
you
want
asked
linton
i
sha
keep
you
long
do
you
think
you
could
put
away
that
book
for
a
minute
and
listen
linton
hesitated
then
shut
the
book
hurry
up
then
he
said
i
was
going
to
said
sheen
i
simply
came
in
to
tell
you
that
i
know
perfectly
well
who
sunk
my
boat
this
afternoon
he
felt
at
once
that
he
had
now
got
linton
undivided
attention
your
boat
said
linton
you
do
mean
to
say
that
was
yours
what
on
earth
were
you
doing
at
the
place
i
do
think
that
any
business
of
yours
is
it
linton
how
did
you
get
back
i
do
think
that
any
business
of
yours
either
i
daresay
disappointed
but
i
did
manage
to
get
back
in
time
for
too
but
i
do
understand
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
was
your
boat
we
took
sunk
corrected
sheen
do
be
a
fool
sheen
what
the
dickens
should
we
want
to
sink
your
boat
for
what
happened
was
this
albert
you
remember
albert
followed
us
up
to
the
inn
and
smashed
our
boat
while
we
were
having
tea
when
we
got
out
and
found
it
sunk
we
bagged
the
only
other
one
we
could
see
we
had
a
notion
it
was
yours
we
thought
it
belonged
to
some
fisherman
chap
then
you
did
sink
my
boat
of
course
we
did
what
do
you
take
us
for
sorry
said
sheen
i
thought
it
was
a
queer
thing
for
you
to
have
done
i
glad
it
was
you
good
night
but
look
here
said
linton
do
go
it
must
have
landed
you
in
a
frightful
hole
did
it
a
little
but
it
does
matter
good
night
but
half
a
second
sheen
sheen
had
disappeared
linton
sat
on
till
lights
were
turned
off
ruminating
he
had
a
very
tender
conscience
where
other
members
of
the
school
were
concerned
though
it
was
tougher
as
regarded
masters
and
he
was
full
of
remorse
at
the
thought
of
how
nearly
he
had
got
sheen
into
trouble
by
borrowing
his
boat
that
afternoon
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
make
it
up
to
him
in
some
way
it
was
characteristic
of
linton
that
the
episode
did
not
in
any
way
alter
his
attitude
towards
sheen
another
boy
in
a
similar
position
might
have
become
effusively
friendly
linton
looked
on
the
affair
in
a
calm
judicial
spirit
he
had
done
sheen
a
bad
turn
but
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
fling
himself
on
his
neck
and
swear
eternal
friendship
his
demeanour
on
the
occasions
when
they
came
in
contact
with
each
other
remained
the
same
he
did
not
speak
to
him
and
he
did
not
seem
to
see
him
but
all
the
while
he
was
remembering
that
somehow
or
other
he
must
do
him
a
good
turn
of
some
sort
by
way
of
levelling
things
up
again
when
that
good
turn
had
been
done
he
might
dismiss
him
from
his
thoughts
altogether
sheen
for
his
part
made
no
attempt
to
trade
on
the
matter
of
the
boat
he
seemed
as
little
anxious
to
be
friendly
with
linton
as
linton
was
to
be
friendly
with
him
for
this
linton
was
grateful
and
continued
to
keep
his
eyes
open
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
opportunity
of
squaring
up
matters
between
them
his
chance
was
not
long
in
coming
the
feeling
in
the
house
against
sheen
caused
by
the
story
of
his
encounter
with
attell
had
not
diminished
stanning
had
fostered
it
in
various
little
ways
it
was
not
difficult
when
a
house
of
the
standing
in
the
school
which
possessed
exhibits
a
weak
spot
the
rest
of
the
school
do
not
require
a
great
deal
of
encouragement
to
go
on
prodding
that
weak
spot
in
short
the
school
rotted
seymour
about
sheen
and
seymour
raged
impotently
fags
of
other
houses
expended
much
crude
satire
on
seymour
fags
and
even
the
seniors
of
the
house
came
in
for
their
share
of
the
baiting
most
of
the
houses
at
wrykyn
were
jealous
of
seymour
and
this
struck
them
as
an
admirable
opportunity
of
getting
something
of
their
own
back
one
afternoon
not
long
after
sheen
conversation
with
linton
stanning
came
into
seymour
senior
and
sat
down
on
the
table
the
senior
objected
to
members
of
other
houses
coming
and
sitting
on
their
table
as
if
they
had
bought
that
rickety
piece
of
furniture
but
stanning
reputation
as
a
bruiser
kept
their
resentment
within
bounds
hullo
you
chaps
said
stanning
the
members
of
the
senior
made
no
reply
but
continued
as
mr
kipling
has
it
to
persecute
their
vocations
most
of
them
were
brewing
they
went
on
brewing
with
the
earnest
concentration
of
you
a
cheery
lot
said
stanning
but
i
do
wonder
you
got
the
hump
i
should
be
a
bit
sick
if
we
got
a
skunk
like
that
in
our
house
heard
the
latest
some
lunatic
said
no
what
thereby
delivering
the
bound
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
sheen
apologised
to
attell
there
was
a
sensation
in
the
senior
as
stanning
had
expected
he
knew
his
men
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
any
story
which
centred
round
sheen
cowardice
would
be
believed
by
them
so
he
had
not
troubled
to
invent
a
lie
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
disprove
he
knew
that
in
the
present
state
of
feeling
in
the
house
sheen
would
not
be
given
a
hearing
no
shouted
the
senior
this
was
the
last
straw
the
fellow
seemed
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
lower
the
prestige
of
the
house
fact
said
stanning
i
thought
you
knew
he
continued
to
sit
on
the
table
swinging
his
legs
while
the
full
horror
of
his
story
sunk
into
the
senior
mind
i
wonder
you
do
do
something
about
it
why
do
you
touch
him
up
he
not
a
prefect
but
they
were
not
prepared
to
go
to
that
length
the
senior
had
a
great
respect
both
for
drummond
word
and
his
skill
with
his
hands
he
had
said
he
would
slay
any
one
who
touched
sheen
and
they
were
of
opinion
that
he
would
do
it
he
is
in
said
one
of
the
brewers
looking
up
from
his
his
study
door
was
open
when
i
passed
i
say
why
not
rag
his
study
suggested
another
thickly
through
a
mouthful
of
toast
stanning
smiled
good
idea
he
said
it
struck
him
that
some
small
upheaval
of
sheen
study
furniture
coupled
with
the
burning
of
one
or
two
books
might
check
to
some
extent
that
student
work
for
the
gotford
and
if
sheen
could
be
stopped
working
for
the
gotford
he
stanning
would
romp
home
in
the
matter
of
brilliance
there
was
no
comparison
between
them
it
was
sheen
painful
habit
of
work
which
made
him
dangerous
linton
had
been
listening
to
this
conversation
in
silence
he
had
come
to
the
senior
to
borrow
a
book
he
now
slipped
out
and
made
his
way
to
drummond
study
drummond
was
in
linton
proceeded
to
business
i
say
drummond
hullo
that
man
stanning
has
come
in
he
getting
the
senior
to
rag
sheen
study
what
linton
repeated
his
statement
does
the
man
think
he
owns
the
house
said
drummond
where
is
he
coming
up
now
i
hear
them
what
are
you
going
to
do
stop
them
what
do
you
think
of
course
i
am
i
not
going
to
have
any
of
appleby
crew
coming
into
seymour
and
ragging
studies
this
ought
to
be
worth
seeing
said
linton
look
on
me
as
his
friend
i
help
if
you
want
me
but
it
your
scene
drummond
opened
his
door
just
as
stanning
and
his
myrmidons
were
passing
it
hullo
stanning
he
said
stanning
turned
the
punitive
expedition
stopped
do
you
want
anything
inquired
drummond
politely
the
members
of
the
senior
who
were
with
stanning
rallied
round
silent
and
interested
this
dramatic
situation
appealed
to
them
they
had
a
passion
for
rows
and
this
looked
distinctly
promising
there
was
a
pause
stanning
looked
carefully
at
drummond
drummond
looked
carefully
at
stanning
i
was
going
to
see
sheen
said
stanning
at
length
he
is
in
oh
another
pause
was
it
anything
special
inquired
drummond
pleasantly
the
expedition
edged
a
little
forward
no
oh
no
nothing
special
said
stanning
the
expedition
looked
disappointed
any
message
i
can
give
him
asked
drummond
no
thanks
said
stanning
sure
quite
thanks
i
do
think
it
worth
while
your
waiting
he
may
not
be
in
for
some
time
no
perhaps
not
thanks
so
long
so
long
stanning
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
down
the
passage
drummond
went
back
into
his
study
and
shut
the
door
the
expedition
deprived
of
its
paused
irresolutely
outside
then
it
followed
its
leader
example
there
was
peace
in
the
passage
xv
the
rout
at
ripton
on
the
saturday
following
this
episode
the
first
fifteen
travelled
to
ripton
to
play
the
return
match
with
that
school
on
its
own
ground
of
the
two
ripton
matches
the
one
played
at
wrykyn
was
always
the
big
event
of
the
football
year
but
the
other
came
next
in
importance
and
the
telegram
which
was
despatched
to
the
school
shop
at
the
close
of
the
game
was
always
awaited
with
anxiety
this
year
wrykyn
looked
forward
to
the
return
match
with
a
certain
amount
of
apathy
due
partly
to
the
fact
that
the
school
was
in
a
slack
unpatriotic
state
and
partly
to
the
hammering
the
team
had
received
in
the
previous
term
when
the
ripton
centre
had
run
through
and
scored
with
monotonous
regularity
we
bound
to
get
sat
on
was
the
general
verdict
of
the
school
allardyce
while
thoroughly
agreeing
with
this
opinion
did
his
best
to
conceal
the
fact
from
the
rest
of
the
team
he
had
certainly
done
his
duty
by
them
every
day
for
the
past
fortnight
the
forwards
and
outsides
had
turned
out
to
run
and
pass
and
on
the
saturdays
there
had
been
matches
with
corpus
oxford
and
the
cambridge
old
wrykinians
in
both
games
the
school
had
been
beaten
in
fact
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
only
perform
really
well
when
they
had
no
opponents
to
see
the
racing
down
the
field
at
practice
and
scoring
innumerable
imaginary
tries
one
was
apt
to
be
misled
into
considering
them
a
fine
quartette
but
when
there
was
a
match
all
the
beautiful
dash
and
precision
of
the
passing
faded
away
and
the
last
thing
they
did
was
to
run
straight
barry
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
who
played
the
game
properly
but
as
regarded
condition
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
team
even
trevor
could
not
have
made
them
train
harder
and
allardyce
in
his
more
sanguine
moments
had
a
shadowy
hope
that
the
ripton
score
might
with
care
be
kept
in
the
teens
barry
had
bought
a
at
the
station
and
he
unfolded
it
as
the
train
began
to
move
searching
the
column
of
the
middle
page
as
we
all
do
when
we
buy
the
on
saturday
to
see
how
our
names
look
in
print
and
what
sort
of
a
team
the
enemy
has
got
he
made
a
remarkable
discovery
at
the
same
moment
drummond
on
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
did
the
same
i
say
he
said
they
must
have
had
a
big
at
ripton
have
you
seen
the
team
they
got
out
today
i
was
just
looking
at
it
said
barry
what
up
with
it
inquired
allardyce
let
have
a
look
they
only
got
about
half
their
proper
team
they
got
a
different
back
grey
is
playing
both
their
centres
are
though
said
drummond
more
fun
for
us
old
chap
said
attell
i
going
home
again
stop
the
train
drummond
said
nothing
he
hated
attell
most
when
he
tried
to
be
facetious
dunn
is
playing
nor
is
waite
said
barry
so
they
have
got
either
of
their
proper
halves
i
say
we
might
have
a
chance
of
doing
something
today
of
course
we
shall
said
allardyce
you
only
got
to
buck
up
and
we
got
them
on
toast
the
atmosphere
in
the
carriage
became
charged
with
optimism
it
seemed
a
simple
thing
to
defeat
a
side
which
was
practically
a
ripton
a
team
the
centre
were
there
still
it
was
true
but
allardyce
and
drummond
ought
to
be
able
to
prevent
the
halves
ever
getting
the
ball
out
to
them
the
team
looked
on
those
two
unknown
halves
as
timid
novices
who
would
lose
their
heads
at
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
system
of
football
teaching
at
ripton
was
so
perfect
and
the
keenness
so
great
that
the
second
fifteen
was
nearly
as
good
as
the
first
every
year
but
the
wrykyn
team
did
not
know
this
with
the
exception
of
allardyce
who
kept
his
knowledge
to
himself
and
they
arrived
at
ripton
jaunty
and
confident
keith
the
ripton
captain
who
was
one
of
the
centre
who
had
made
so
many
holes
in
the
wrykyn
defence
in
the
previous
term
met
the
team
at
the
station
and
walked
up
to
the
school
with
them
carrying
allardyce
bag
you
seem
to
have
lost
a
good
many
men
at
christmas
said
allardyce
we
were
reading
the
in
the
train
apparently
only
got
ten
of
your
last
term
lot
have
they
all
left
the
ripton
captain
grinned
ruefully
not
much
he
replied
they
all
here
all
except
dunn
you
remember
dunn
little
chap
who
played
half
he
always
had
his
hair
quite
tidy
and
parted
exactly
in
the
middle
all
through
the
game
oh
yes
i
remember
dunn
what
he
doing
now
gone
to
coopers
hill
rot
his
not
going
to
the
varsity
he
have
walked
into
his
blue
allardyce
agreed
he
had
marked
dunn
in
the
match
of
the
previous
term
and
that
immaculate
sportsman
had
made
things
not
a
little
warm
for
him
where
are
all
the
others
then
he
asked
where
that
other
half
of
yours
and
the
rest
of
the
forwards
mumps
said
keith
what
it
a
fact
rot
is
it
we
had
a
regular
bout
of
it
twenty
fellows
got
it
altogether
naturally
four
of
those
were
in
the
team
that
the
way
things
happen
i
only
wonder
the
whole
scrum
did
have
it
what
beastly
luck
said
allardyce
we
had
measles
like
that
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
summer
term
and
had
to
play
the
incogs
and
zingari
with
a
sort
of
second
eleven
we
got
mopped
that
what
we
shall
get
this
afternoon
i
afraid
said
keith
oh
no
said
allardyce
of
course
you
wo
and
as
events
turned
out
that
was
one
of
the
truest
remarks
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
one
of
the
drawbacks
to
playing
ripton
on
its
own
ground
was
the
crowd
another
was
the
fact
that
one
generally
got
beaten
but
your
sportsman
can
put
up
with
defeat
what
he
does
not
like
is
a
crowd
that
regards
him
as
a
subtle
blend
of
incompetent
idiot
and
malicious
scoundrel
and
says
so
very
loud
and
clear
it
was
not
of
course
the
school
that
did
this
they
spent
their
time
blushing
for
the
shouters
it
was
the
patriotic
inhabitants
of
ripton
town
who
made
the
school
wish
that
they
could
be
saved
from
their
friends
the
football
ground
at
ripton
was
at
the
edge
of
the
school
fields
separated
from
the
road
by
narrow
iron
railings
and
along
these
railings
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
town
would
line
up
and
smoke
and
yell
and
spit
and
yell
again
as
wordsworth
wrote
there
are
two
voices
they
were
on
something
like
the
following
lines
inside
the
railings
buck
up
get
it
out
outside
the
railings
gow
it
ripton
that
the
way
ripton
twist
his
neck
ripton
sit
on
his
forcibly
described
head
ripton
gow
it
ripton
haw
haw
haw
they
ai
no
use
ripton
kick
in
the
eye
ripton
haw
haw
haw
the
bursts
of
merriment
signalised
the
violent
downfall
of
some
dangerous
opponent
the
school
loathed
these
humble
supporters
and
occasionally
fastidious
juniors
would
go
the
length
of
throwing
chunks
of
mud
at
them
through
the
railings
but
nothing
discouraged
them
or
abated
their
fervid
desire
to
see
the
school
win
every
year
they
seemed
to
increase
in
zeal
and
they
were
always
in
great
form
at
the
wrykyn
match
it
would
be
charitable
to
ascribe
to
this
reason
the
gruesome
happenings
of
that
afternoon
they
needed
some
explaining
away
allardyce
won
the
toss
and
chose
to
start
downhill
with
the
wind
in
his
favour
it
is
always
best
to
get
these
advantages
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
if
one
starts
against
the
wind
it
usually
changes
ends
at
amidst
a
roar
from
both
and
a
volley
of
howls
from
the
road
a
ripton
forward
kicked
off
the
ball
flew
in
the
direction
of
stanning
on
the
right
wing
a
storm
of
laughter
arose
from
the
road
as
he
dropped
it
the
first
scrum
was
formed
on
the
wrykyn
line
the
ripton
forwards
got
the
ball
and
heeled
with
their
usual
neatness
the
ripton
half
who
was
taking
the
scrum
gathered
it
cleanly
and
passed
to
his
colleague
he
was
a
sturdy
youth
with
a
dark
rather
forbidding
face
in
which
the
acute
observer
might
have
read
signs
of
the
savage
he
was
of
the
breed
which
is
vaguely
described
at
public
schools
as
nigger
a
term
covering
every
variety
of
shade
from
ebony
to
light
lemon
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
a
sent
home
to
england
to
be
educated
drummond
recognised
him
as
he
dived
forward
to
tackle
him
the
last
place
where
they
had
met
had
been
the
roped
ring
at
aldershot
it
was
his
opponent
in
the
final
of
the
feathers
he
reached
him
as
he
swerved
and
they
fell
together
the
ball
bounded
forward
hullo
peteiro
he
said
thought
you
left
the
other
grinned
recognition
hullo
drummond
going
up
to
aldershot
this
year
yes
so
am
i
the
scrum
had
formed
by
now
and
further
conversation
was
impossible
drummond
looked
a
little
thoughtful
as
he
put
the
ball
in
he
had
been
told
that
peteiro
was
leaving
ripton
at
christmas
it
was
a
nuisance
his
being
still
at
school
drummond
was
not
afraid
of
him
he
would
have
fought
a
champion
of
the
world
if
the
school
had
expected
him
to
but
he
could
not
help
remembering
that
it
was
only
by
the
very
narrowest
margin
and
after
a
terrific
three
rounds
that
he
had
beaten
him
in
the
feathers
the
year
before
it
would
be
too
awful
for
words
if
the
decision
were
to
be
reversed
in
the
coming
competition
but
he
was
not
allowed
much
leisure
for
pondering
on
the
future
the
present
was
too
full
of
incident
and
excitement
the
withdrawal
of
the
four
invalids
and
the
departure
of
dunn
had
not
reduced
the
ripton
team
to
that
wreck
of
its
former
self
which
the
wrykyn
fifteen
had
looked
for
on
the
contrary
their
play
seemed
if
anything
a
shade
better
than
it
had
been
in
the
former
match
there
was
all
the
old
aggressiveness
and
peteiro
and
his
partner
so
far
from
being
timid
novices
and
losing
their
heads
eclipsed
the
exhibition
given
at
wrykyn
by
waite
and
dunn
play
had
only
been
in
progress
six
minutes
when
keith
taking
a
pass
on
the
line
slipped
past
attell
ran
round
the
back
and
scored
between
the
posts
three
minutes
later
the
other
ripton
centre
scored
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
the
wrykyn
line
had
been
crossed
five
times
and
each
of
the
tries
had
been
converted
you
fellows
get
that
ball
in
the
scrum
demanded
allardyce
plaintively
as
the
team
began
for
the
fifth
time
the
old
familiar
walk
to
the
line
pack
tight
and
get
the
first
shove
the
result
of
this
address
was
to
increase
the
ripton
lead
by
four
points
in
his
anxiety
to
get
the
ball
one
of
the
wrykyn
forwards
started
heeling
before
it
was
in
and
the
referee
promptly
gave
a
free
kick
to
ripton
for
foot
up
as
this
event
took
place
within
easy
reach
of
the
wrykyn
goal
and
immediately
in
front
of
the
same
keith
had
no
difficulty
in
bringing
off
the
penalty
by
the
crowd
in
the
road
hoarse
with
laughter
had
exhausted
all
their
adjectives
and
were
repeating
themselves
the
ripton
score
was
six
goals
a
penalty
goal
and
two
tries
to
nil
and
the
wrykyn
team
was
a
demoralised
rabble
the
fact
that
the
rate
of
scoring
slackened
somewhat
after
the
interval
may
be
attributed
to
the
disinclination
of
the
riptonians
to
exert
themselves
unduly
they
ceased
playing
in
the
stern
and
scientific
spirit
in
which
they
had
started
and
instead
of
adhering
to
an
orthodox
game
began
to
enjoy
themselves
the
forwards
no
longer
heeled
like
a
machine
they
broke
through
ambitiously
and
tried
to
score
on
their
own
account
when
the
outsides
got
as
far
as
the
back
they
did
not
pass
they
tried
to
drop
goals
in
this
way
only
points
were
scored
after
allardyce
and
drummond
battled
on
nobly
but
with
their
pack
hopelessly
outclassed
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
do
anything
of
material
use
barry
on
the
wing
tackled
his
man
whenever
the
latter
got
the
ball
but
as
a
rule
the
centres
did
not
pass
but
attacked
by
themselves
at
last
by
way
of
a
fitting
conclusion
to
the
rout
the
ripton
back
catching
a
high
punt
ran
instead
of
kicking
and
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
town
contingent
scored
with
this
incident
the
visiting
team
drained
the
last
dregs
of
the
bitter
cup
humiliation
could
go
no
further
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
referee
blew
his
whistle
for
no
side
three
cheers
for
wrykyn
said
keith
to
the
fifteen
victims
it
sounded
ironical
xvi
drummond
goes
into
retirement
the
return
journey
of
a
school
team
after
a
crushing
defeat
in
a
foreign
match
is
never
a
very
exhilarating
business
those
members
of
the
side
who
have
not
yet
received
their
colours
are
wondering
which
of
them
is
to
be
sacrificed
to
popular
indignation
and
chucked
the
rest
who
have
managed
to
get
their
caps
are
feeling
that
even
now
of
the
school
will
be
saying
that
they
are
not
worth
a
place
in
the
third
fifteen
while
the
captain
brooding
apart
is
becoming
soured
at
the
thought
that
posterity
will
forget
what
little
good
he
may
have
done
and
remember
only
that
it
was
in
his
year
that
the
school
got
so
many
points
taken
off
them
by
conversation
does
not
ripple
and
sparkle
during
these
the
wrykyn
team
made
the
journey
in
almost
unbroken
silence
they
were
all
stiff
and
sore
and
their
feelings
were
such
as
to
unfit
them
for
talking
to
people
the
school
took
the
thing
very
philosophically
a
bad
sign
when
a
school
is
in
a
healthy
normal
condition
it
should
be
stirred
up
by
a
bad
defeat
by
another
school
like
a
disturbed
wasps
nest
wrykyn
made
one
or
two
remarks
about
people
who
could
not
play
footer
for
toffee
and
then
let
the
thing
drop
sheen
was
too
busy
with
his
work
and
his
boxing
to
have
much
leisure
for
mourning
over
this
latest
example
of
the
present
inefficiency
of
the
school
the
examination
for
the
gotford
was
to
come
off
in
two
days
and
the
boxing
was
fixed
for
the
following
wednesday
in
five
days
therefore
he
would
get
his
chance
of
retrieving
his
lost
place
in
the
school
he
was
certain
that
he
could
at
any
rate
make
a
very
good
show
against
anyone
in
the
school
even
drummond
joe
bevan
was
delighted
with
his
progress
and
quoted
shakespeare
volubly
in
his
admiration
jack
bruce
and
francis
added
their
tribute
and
the
knife
and
boot
boy
paid
him
the
neatest
compliment
of
all
by
refusing
to
have
any
more
dealings
with
him
whatsoever
his
professional
duties
explained
the
knife
and
boot
boy
did
not
include
being
punched
in
the
heye
by
blokes
and
he
did
not
intend
to
be
put
upon
you
do
all
right
said
jack
bruce
as
they
were
motoring
home
if
they
let
you
go
in
for
it
all
but
how
do
you
know
they
will
have
they
chosen
the
men
yet
not
yet
they
do
do
it
till
the
day
before
but
there
wo
be
any
difficulty
about
that
drummond
will
let
me
have
a
shot
if
he
thinks
i
good
enough
oh
you
good
enough
said
bruce
and
when
on
monday
evening
francis
on
receipt
of
no
fewer
than
four
blows
in
a
single
round
a
record
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
said
that
if
ever
he
happened
to
want
a
leetle
darg
that
was
a
perfect
bag
of
tricks
and
had
got
a
pedigree
mind
you
he
francis
would
be
proud
to
supply
that
animal
sheen
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
to
approach
drummond
on
the
subject
of
the
house
boxing
it
would
be
a
little
awkward
at
first
and
conversation
would
probably
run
somewhat
stiffly
but
all
would
be
well
once
he
had
explained
himself
but
things
had
been
happening
in
his
absence
which
complicated
the
situation
allardyce
was
having
tea
with
drummond
who
had
been
stopping
in
with
a
sore
throat
he
had
come
principally
to
make
arrangements
for
the
match
between
his
house
and
seymour
in
the
round
of
the
competition
you
looking
bad
he
said
taking
a
seat
i
feeling
bad
said
drummond
for
the
past
few
days
he
had
been
very
much
out
of
sorts
he
put
it
down
to
a
chill
caught
after
the
ripton
match
he
had
never
mustered
up
sufficient
courage
to
sponge
himself
with
cold
water
after
soaking
in
a
hot
bath
and
he
occasionally
suffered
for
it
what
up
inquired
allardyce
oh
i
do
know
sort
of
beastly
feeling
sore
throat
nothing
much
only
it
makes
you
feel
rather
rotten
allardyce
looked
interested
i
say
he
said
it
looks
as
if
i
wonder
i
hope
you
have
what
mumps
it
sounds
jolly
like
it
mumps
of
course
i
not
why
should
i
allardyce
produced
a
letter
from
his
pocket
i
got
this
from
keith
the
ripton
captain
this
morning
you
know
they
had
a
lot
of
the
thing
there
oh
did
you
that
was
why
they
had
such
a
bad
team
out
bad
team
murmured
drummond
well
i
mean
not
their
best
team
they
had
four
of
their
men
down
with
mumps
here
what
keith
says
listen
bit
about
hoping
we
got
back
all
right
and
so
on
first
then
he
says
here
it
is
of
our
fellows
has
got
the
mumps
one
of
the
forwards
rather
a
long
man
who
was
good
out
of
touch
he
developed
it
a
couple
of
days
after
the
match
it
lucky
that
all
our
card
games
are
over
we
beat
john
oxford
last
wednesday
and
that
finished
the
card
but
it
rather
rot
up
the
house
matches
we
should
have
walked
the
cup
but
there
no
knowing
what
will
happen
now
i
hope
none
of
your
lot
caught
the
mumps
from
browning
during
the
game
it
quite
likely
of
course
browning
ought
not
to
have
been
playing
but
i
had
no
notion
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
him
he
never
said
he
felt
bad
you
got
it
drummond
that
what
the
matter
with
you
oh
rot
said
drummond
it
only
a
chill
but
the
school
doctor
who
had
looked
in
at
the
house
to
dose
a
small
seymourite
who
had
indulged
too
heartily
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
had
other
views
and
before
drummond
was
hurried
off
to
the
infirmary
sheen
went
to
drummond
study
after
preparation
had
begun
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
out
not
being
on
speaking
terms
with
a
single
member
of
the
house
he
was
always
as
regarded
items
of
school
news
as
a
rule
he
had
to
wait
until
jack
bruce
told
him
before
learning
of
any
occurrence
of
interest
he
had
no
notion
that
mumps
was
the
cause
of
drummond
absence
and
he
sat
and
waited
patiently
for
him
in
his
study
till
the
bell
rang
for
prayers
the
only
possible
explanation
that
occurred
to
him
was
that
drummond
was
in
somebody
else
study
and
he
could
not
put
his
theory
to
the
test
by
going
and
looking
it
was
only
when
drummond
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
at
prayers
that
sheen
began
to
suspect
that
something
might
have
happened
it
was
maddening
not
to
be
able
to
make
inquiries
he
had
almost
decided
to
go
and
ask
linton
and
risk
whatever
might
be
the
consequences
of
such
a
step
when
he
remembered
that
the
matron
must
know
he
went
to
her
and
was
told
that
drummond
was
in
the
infirmary
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
this
made
his
position
a
great
deal
more
difficult
in
ten
minutes
he
could
have
explained
matters
to
drummond
if
he
had
found
him
in
his
study
but
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
task
to
put
the
thing
clearly
in
a
letter
meanwhile
it
was
and
he
soon
found
his
hands
too
full
with
his
dormitory
to
enable
him
to
think
out
the
phrasing
of
that
letter
the
dormitory
which
was
recruited
entirely
from
the
junior
had
heard
of
drummond
departure
with
rejoicings
they
liked
drummond
but
he
was
a
good
deal
too
fond
of
the
iron
hand
for
their
tastes
a
night
with
sheen
in
charge
should
prove
a
welcome
change
a
deafening
uproar
was
going
on
when
sheen
arrived
and
as
he
came
into
the
room
somebody
turned
the
gas
out
he
found
some
matches
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
lit
it
again
just
in
time
to
see
a
sportive
youth
tearing
the
clothes
off
his
bed
and
piling
them
on
the
floor
a
month
before
he
would
not
have
known
how
to
grapple
with
such
a
situation
but
his
evenings
with
joe
bevan
had
given
him
the
habit
of
making
up
his
mind
and
acting
rapidly
drummond
was
wont
to
keep
a
by
his
bedside
for
the
better
observance
of
law
and
order
sheen
possessed
himself
of
this
and
reasoned
with
the
sportive
youth
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
looked
on
in
interested
silence
it
was
a
critical
moment
and
on
his
handling
of
it
depended
sheen
victory
or
defeat
if
he
did
not
keep
his
head
he
was
lost
a
dormitory
is
merciless
to
a
prefect
whose
weakness
they
have
discovered
sheen
kept
his
head
in
a
quiet
pleasant
voice
fingering
the
as
he
spoke
in
an
absent
manner
he
requested
his
young
friend
to
the
bed
rapidly
and
completely
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
no
sound
broke
the
silence
except
the
rustle
of
sheets
and
blankets
at
the
end
of
that
period
the
bed
looked
as
good
as
new
thanks
said
sheen
gratefully
that
very
kind
of
you
he
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
do
let
me
detain
you
he
said
politely
get
into
bed
as
soon
as
you
like
the
dormitory
got
into
bed
sooner
than
they
liked
for
some
reason
the
colossal
rag
they
had
planned
had
fizzled
out
they
were
thoughtful
as
they
crept
between
the
sheets
could
these
things
be
after
much
deliberation
sheen
sent
his
letter
to
drummond
on
the
following
day
it
was
not
a
long
letter
but
it
was
carefully
worded
it
explained
that
he
had
taken
up
boxing
of
late
and
ended
with
a
request
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
act
as
drummond
understudy
in
the
house
competitions
it
was
late
that
evening
when
the
infirmary
attendant
came
over
with
the
answer
like
the
original
letter
the
answer
was
brief
dear
sheen
wrote
drummond
thanks
for
the
offer
i
am
afraid
i
ca
accept
it
we
must
have
the
best
man
linton
is
going
to
box
for
the
house
in
the
xvii
seymour
one
success
this
polite
epistle
it
may
be
mentioned
was
a
revised
version
of
the
one
which
drummond
originally
wrote
in
reply
to
sheen
request
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
answer
in
the
four
brief
words
do
be
a
fool
for
sheen
letter
had
struck
him
as
nothing
more
than
a
contemptible
piece
of
posing
and
he
had
all
the
hatred
for
poses
which
is
a
characteristic
of
the
plain
and
straightforward
type
of
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
sheen
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
was
trying
to
do
the
boy
hero
in
the
school
library
which
had
been
stocked
during
the
dark
ages
when
that
type
of
story
was
popular
there
were
numerous
school
stories
in
which
the
hero
retrieved
a
rocky
reputation
by
thrashing
the
bully
displaying
in
the
encounter
an
intuitive
but
overwhelming
skill
with
his
fists
drummond
could
not
help
feeling
that
sheen
must
have
been
reading
one
of
these
stories
it
was
all
very
fine
and
noble
of
him
to
want
to
show
that
he
was
no
coward
after
all
like
leo
cholmondeley
or
whatever
his
beastly
name
was
in
lads
of
or
some
such
piffling
book
but
thought
drummond
in
his
cold
practical
way
what
about
the
house
if
sheen
thought
that
seymour
was
going
to
chuck
away
all
chance
of
winning
one
of
the
events
simply
in
order
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
the
young
hero
the
sooner
he
got
rid
of
that
sort
of
idea
the
better
if
he
wanted
to
do
the
leo
cholmondeley
business
let
him
go
and
chuck
a
kid
into
the
river
and
jump
in
and
save
him
but
he
was
going
to
have
the
house
let
in
for
twenty
sheens
such
were
the
meditations
of
drummond
when
the
infirmary
attendant
brought
sheen
letter
to
him
and
he
seized
pencil
and
paper
and
wrote
do
be
a
fool
but
pity
succeeded
contempt
and
he
tore
up
the
writing
after
all
however
much
he
had
deserved
it
the
man
had
had
a
bad
time
it
was
no
use
jumping
on
him
and
at
one
time
they
had
been
pals
might
as
well
do
the
thing
politely
all
of
which
reflections
would
have
been
prevented
had
sheen
thought
of
mentioning
the
simple
fact
that
it
was
joe
bevan
who
had
given
him
the
lessons
to
which
he
referred
in
his
letter
but
he
had
decided
not
to
do
so
wishing
to
avoid
long
explanations
and
there
was
he
felt
a
chance
that
the
letter
might
come
into
other
hands
than
those
of
drummond
so
he
had
preserved
silence
on
that
point
thereby
wrecking
his
entire
scheme
it
struck
him
that
he
might
go
to
linton
explain
his
position
and
ask
him
to
withdraw
in
his
favour
but
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
of
that
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
red
tape
about
the
athletic
arrangements
of
a
house
at
a
public
school
when
once
an
order
has
gone
forth
it
is
difficult
to
get
it
repealed
linton
had
been
chosen
to
represent
the
house
in
the
and
he
would
carry
out
orders
only
illness
would
prevent
him
appearing
in
the
ring
sheen
made
up
his
mind
not
to
try
to
take
his
place
and
went
through
the
days
a
victim
to
gloom
which
was
caused
by
other
things
besides
his
disappointment
respecting
the
boxing
competition
the
gotford
examination
was
over
now
and
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
performance
though
he
did
not
know
it
his
dissatisfaction
was
due
principally
to
the
fact
that
owing
to
his
isolation
he
had
been
unable
to
compare
notes
after
the
examinations
with
the
others
doing
an
examination
without
comparing
notes
subsequently
with
one
rivals
is
like
playing
golf
against
a
bogey
the
imaginary
rival
against
whom
one
pits
oneself
never
makes
a
mistake
our
own
howlers
stand
out
in
all
their
horrid
nakedness
but
we
do
not
realise
that
our
rivals
have
probably
made
others
far
worse
in
this
way
sheen
plumbed
the
depths
of
depression
the
gotford
was
a
purely
classical
examination
with
the
exception
of
one
paper
a
general
knowledge
paper
and
it
was
in
this
that
sheen
fancied
he
had
failed
so
miserably
his
greek
and
latin
verse
were
always
good
his
prose
he
felt
was
not
altogether
beyond
the
pale
but
in
the
general
knowledge
paper
he
had
come
down
heavily
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
he
had
only
known
the
paper
was
an
exceptionally
hard
one
and
there
was
not
a
single
candidate
for
the
scholarship
who
felt
satisfied
with
his
treatment
of
it
it
was
to
questions
ten
eleven
and
thirteen
of
this
paper
that
cardew
of
the
school
house
who
had
entered
for
the
scholarship
for
the
sole
reason
that
competitors
got
excused
two
clear
days
of
ordinary
wrote
the
following
answer
see
encylopaedia
britannica
edition
if
they
really
wanted
to
know
he
said
subsequently
that
was
the
authority
to
go
to
he
himself
would
probably
misinform
them
altogether
in
addition
to
the
gotford
and
the
house
boxing
the
house
fives
now
came
on
and
the
authorities
of
seymour
were
in
no
small
perplexity
they
met
together
in
rigby
study
to
discuss
the
matter
their
difficulty
was
this
there
was
only
one
inmate
of
seymour
who
had
a
chance
of
carrying
off
the
house
fives
cup
and
that
was
sheen
the
house
was
asking
itself
what
was
to
be
done
about
it
you
see
said
rigby
you
can
look
at
it
in
two
ways
whichever
you
like
we
ought
certainly
to
send
in
our
best
man
for
the
pot
whatever
sort
of
chap
he
is
but
then
come
to
think
of
it
sheen
ca
very
well
be
said
to
belong
to
the
house
at
all
when
a
man
been
cut
dead
during
the
whole
term
he
ca
be
looked
on
as
one
of
the
house
very
well
see
what
i
mean
of
course
he
ca
said
mill
who
was
second
in
command
at
seymour
mill
attitude
towards
his
fellow
men
was
one
of
incessant
hostility
he
seemed
to
bear
a
grudge
against
the
entire
race
rigby
resumed
he
was
a
pacific
person
and
hated
anything
resembling
rows
in
the
house
he
had
been
sorry
for
sheen
and
would
have
been
glad
to
give
him
a
chance
of
setting
himself
on
his
legs
again
you
see
he
said
this
is
what
i
mean
we
either
recognise
existence
or
we
do
follow
we
ca
get
him
to
win
this
cup
for
us
and
then
when
he
has
done
it
go
on
cutting
him
and
treating
him
as
if
he
did
belong
to
the
house
at
all
i
know
he
let
the
house
down
awfully
badly
in
that
business
but
still
if
he
lifts
the
fives
cup
that
square
the
thing
if
he
does
anything
to
give
the
house
a
he
must
be
treated
as
if
he
never
let
it
down
at
all
of
course
said
barry
i
vote
we
send
him
in
for
the
fives
what
rot
said
mill
it
is
as
if
none
of
the
rest
of
us
played
fives
we
are
as
good
as
sheen
said
barry
i
do
care
i
call
it
rot
letting
a
chap
like
him
represent
the
house
at
anything
if
he
were
the
best
in
the
world
i
would
let
him
play
for
the
house
rigby
was
impressed
by
his
vehemence
he
hesitated
after
all
barry
he
said
i
do
know
perhaps
it
might
you
see
he
did
well
i
really
think
we
better
have
somebody
else
the
house
has
got
its
knife
into
sheen
too
much
just
at
present
to
want
him
as
a
representative
there
only
be
sickness
do
you
think
who
else
is
there
so
it
came
about
that
menzies
was
chosen
to
uphold
the
house
in
the
fives
courts
sheen
was
not
surprised
but
it
was
not
pleasant
he
was
certainly
having
bad
luck
in
his
attempts
to
do
something
for
the
house
perhaps
if
he
won
the
gotford
they
might
show
a
little
enthusiasm
the
gotford
always
caused
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
the
school
it
was
the
best
thing
of
its
kind
in
existence
at
wrykyn
and
even
the
most
abandoned
loafers
liked
to
feel
that
their
house
had
won
it
it
was
just
possible
thought
sheen
that
a
brilliant
win
might
change
the
feelings
of
seymour
towards
him
he
did
not
care
for
the
applause
of
the
multitude
more
than
a
boy
should
but
he
preferred
it
very
decidedly
to
the
cut
direct
things
went
badly
for
seymour
never
in
the
history
of
the
house
or
at
any
rate
in
the
comparatively
recent
history
of
the
house
had
there
been
such
a
slump
in
athletic
trophies
to
begin
with
they
were
soundly
beaten
in
the
for
the
house
football
cup
by
allardyce
lot
with
drummond
away
there
was
none
to
mark
the
captain
of
the
school
team
at
half
and
allardyce
had
raced
through
in
a
manner
that
must
have
compensated
him
to
a
certain
extent
for
the
poor
time
he
had
had
in
first
fifteen
matches
the
game
had
ended
in
a
seymourite
defeat
by
nineteen
points
to
five
nor
had
the
boxing
left
the
house
in
a
better
position
linton
fought
pluckily
in
the
but
went
down
before
stanning
after
beating
a
representative
of
templar
mill
did
not
show
up
well
in
the
and
was
defeated
in
his
first
bout
seymour
were
reduced
to
telling
themselves
how
different
it
all
would
have
been
if
drummond
had
been
there
sheen
watched
the
contests
and
nearly
danced
with
irritation
he
felt
that
he
could
have
eaten
stanning
the
man
was
quick
with
his
left
but
he
could
he
had
a
notion
of
and
the
appeared
to
be
entirely
outside
his
range
he
would
like
to
see
him
tackle
francis
sheen
thought
bitterly
of
drummond
why
on
earth
could
he
have
given
him
a
chance
it
was
maddening
the
fives
carried
on
the
story
menzies
was
swamped
by
a
day
man
he
might
just
as
well
have
stayed
away
altogether
the
star
of
was
very
low
on
the
horizon
and
then
the
house
scored
its
one
success
the
headmaster
announced
it
in
the
hall
after
prayers
in
his
dry
unemotional
way
i
have
received
the
list
of
marks
he
said
from
the
examiners
for
the
gotford
scholarship
he
paused
sheen
felt
a
sudden
calm
triumph
flood
over
him
somehow
intuitively
he
knew
that
he
had
won
he
waited
without
excitement
for
the
next
words
out
of
a
possible
thousand
marks
sheen
who
wins
the
scholarship
obtained
seven
hundred
and
one
stanning
six
hundred
and
four
wilson
sheen
walked
out
of
the
hall
in
the
unique
position
of
a
gotford
winner
with
only
one
friend
to
congratulate
him
jack
bruce
was
the
one
the
other
six
hundred
and
members
of
the
school
made
no
demonstration
there
was
a
pleasant
custom
at
seymour
of
applauding
at
tea
any
seymourite
who
had
won
distinction
and
so
shed
a
reflected
glory
on
the
house
the
head
of
the
house
would
observe
well
played
and
the
rest
of
the
house
would
express
their
emotion
in
the
way
that
seemed
best
to
them
to
the
subsequent
exultation
of
the
local
crockery
merchant
who
had
generally
to
supply
at
least
a
dozen
fresh
cups
and
plates
to
the
house
after
one
of
these
occasions
when
it
was
for
getting
his
first
eleven
or
first
fifteen
cap
that
the
lucky
man
was
being
cheered
the
total
of
breakages
sometimes
ran
into
the
twenties
rigby
good
easy
man
was
a
little
doubtful
as
to
what
course
to
pursue
in
the
circumstances
should
he
give
the
signal
after
all
the
fellow
won
the
gotford
it
was
a
score
for
the
house
and
they
wanted
all
the
scores
they
could
get
in
these
lean
years
perhaps
then
he
had
better
well
played
sheen
said
he
there
was
a
dead
silence
a
giggle
from
the
fags
table
showed
that
the
comedy
of
the
situation
was
not
lost
on
the
young
mind
the
head
of
the
house
looked
troubled
this
was
awfully
awkward
well
played
sheen
he
said
again
do
mention
it
rigby
said
the
winner
of
the
gotford
politely
looking
up
from
his
plate
xviii
mr
bevan
makes
a
suggestion
when
one
has
been
working
hard
with
a
single
end
in
view
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
supreme
moment
is
apt
to
leave
a
feeling
of
emptiness
as
if
life
had
been
drained
of
all
its
interest
and
left
nothing
sufficiently
exciting
to
make
it
worth
doing
horatius
as
he
followed
his
plough
on
a
warm
day
over
the
corn
land
which
his
gratified
country
bestowed
on
him
for
his
masterly
handling
of
the
traffic
on
the
bridge
must
sometimes
have
felt
it
was
a
little
tame
the
feeling
is
far
more
acute
when
one
has
been
unexpectedly
baulked
in
one
desire
for
action
sheen
for
the
first
few
days
after
he
received
drummond
brief
note
felt
that
it
was
useless
for
him
to
try
to
do
anything
the
fates
were
against
him
in
stories
as
mr
anstey
has
pointed
out
the
hero
is
never
long
without
his
chance
of
retrieving
his
reputation
a
mad
bull
comes
into
the
school
grounds
and
he
alone
the
hero
not
the
bull
is
calm
or
there
is
a
fire
and
whose
is
that
pale
and
gesticulating
form
at
the
upper
window
the
bully
of
course
and
who
is
that
climbing
nimbly
up
the
virginia
creeper
why
the
hero
who
else
three
hearty
cheers
for
the
plucky
hero
but
in
real
life
opportunities
of
distinguishing
oneself
are
less
frequent
sheen
continued
his
visits
to
the
blue
boar
but
more
because
he
shrank
from
telling
joe
bevan
that
all
his
trouble
had
been
for
nothing
than
because
he
had
any
definite
object
in
view
it
was
bitter
to
listen
to
the
eulogies
of
the
pugilist
when
all
the
while
he
knew
that
as
far
as
any
immediate
results
were
concerned
it
did
not
really
matter
whether
he
boxed
well
or
feebly
some
day
perhaps
as
mr
bevan
was
fond
of
pointing
out
when
he
approached
the
subject
of
disadvantages
of
boxing
he
might
meet
a
hooligan
when
he
was
crossing
a
field
with
his
sister
but
he
found
that
but
small
consolation
he
was
in
the
position
of
one
who
wants
a
small
sum
of
ready
money
and
is
told
that
in
a
few
years
he
may
come
into
a
fortune
by
the
time
he
got
a
chance
of
proving
himself
a
man
with
his
hands
he
would
be
an
old
wrykinian
he
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
jack
bruce
was
sympathetic
and
talked
more
freely
than
was
his
wont
i
ca
understand
it
he
said
drummond
always
seemed
a
good
sort
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
sent
you
in
for
the
house
like
a
shot
are
you
sure
you
put
it
plainly
in
your
letter
what
did
you
say
sheen
repeated
the
main
points
of
his
letter
did
you
tell
him
who
had
been
teaching
you
no
i
just
said
i
been
boxing
lately
pity
said
jack
bruce
if
you
mentioned
that
it
was
joe
who
been
training
you
he
would
probably
have
been
much
more
for
it
you
see
he
could
know
whether
you
were
any
good
or
not
from
your
letter
but
if
you
told
him
that
joe
bevan
and
hunt
both
thought
you
good
he
have
seen
there
was
something
in
it
it
never
occurred
to
me
like
a
fool
i
was
counting
on
the
thing
so
much
that
it
did
strike
me
there
would
be
any
real
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
see
my
point
especially
when
he
got
mumps
and
go
in
himself
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
and
the
conversation
turned
to
the
prospects
of
jack
bruce
father
in
the
forthcoming
election
the
polling
for
which
had
just
begun
i
busy
now
said
bruce
i
not
sure
that
i
shall
be
able
to
do
much
sparring
with
you
for
a
bit
my
dear
chap
do
let
me
oh
it
all
right
really
taking
you
to
the
boar
does
land
me
out
of
my
way
at
all
most
of
the
work
lies
round
in
this
direction
i
call
at
cottages
and
lug
oldest
inhabitants
to
the
poll
it
rare
sport
does
your
pater
know
oh
yes
he
rots
me
about
it
like
anything
but
all
the
same
i
believe
he
really
rather
bucked
because
i
roped
in
quite
a
dozen
voters
who
would
have
stirred
a
yard
if
i
had
turned
up
where
we
scoring
pedder
has
got
a
car
yet
and
these
old
rotters
round
here
are
going
to
move
out
of
their
chairs
to
go
for
a
ride
in
an
ordinary
cart
but
they
chuck
away
their
crutches
and
hop
into
a
motor
like
one
it
must
be
rather
a
rag
said
sheen
the
car
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
blue
boar
sheen
got
out
and
ran
upstairs
to
the
gymnasium
joe
bevan
was
sparring
a
round
with
francis
he
watched
them
while
he
changed
but
without
the
enthusiasm
of
which
he
had
been
conscious
on
previous
occasions
the
solid
cleverness
of
joe
bevan
and
the
quickness
and
cunning
of
the
were
as
much
in
evidence
as
before
but
somehow
the
glamour
and
romance
which
had
surrounded
them
were
gone
he
no
longer
watched
eagerly
to
pick
up
the
slightest
hint
from
these
experts
he
felt
no
more
interest
than
he
would
have
felt
in
watching
a
game
of
lawn
tennis
he
been
keen
since
his
disappointment
with
regard
to
the
house
boxing
he
had
become
indifferent
joe
bevan
noticed
this
before
he
had
been
boxing
with
him
a
minute
hullo
sir
he
said
what
this
tired
today
not
feeling
well
you
are
boxing
like
yourself
not
at
all
you
are
there
no
weight
behind
you
tapping
what
the
matter
with
your
feet
too
you
are
getting
about
as
quickly
as
i
should
like
to
see
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
nothing
that
i
know
of
said
sheen
i
sorry
i
so
rotten
have
another
try
the
second
try
proved
as
unsatisfactory
as
the
first
he
was
listless
and
his
leads
and
counters
lacked
conviction
joe
bevan
who
identified
himself
with
his
pupils
with
that
thoroughness
which
is
the
of
the
boxing
instructor
looked
so
pained
at
his
sudden
loss
of
form
that
sheen
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
confide
in
him
after
all
he
must
tell
him
some
time
the
fact
is
he
said
as
they
sat
on
the
balcony
overlooking
the
river
waiting
for
jack
bruce
to
return
with
his
car
i
had
a
bit
of
a
sickener
i
thought
you
got
sick
of
it
said
mr
bevan
well
have
a
bit
of
a
rest
i
do
mean
that
i
tired
of
boxing
sheen
hastened
to
explain
after
all
the
trouble
you
taken
with
me
it
would
be
a
bit
thick
if
i
chucked
it
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
get
on
it
is
that
but
you
know
how
keen
i
was
on
boxing
for
the
house
joe
bevan
nodded
did
you
get
beat
they
would
let
me
go
in
said
sheen
but
bless
me
you
have
made
babies
of
them
what
was
the
instructor
doing
could
he
see
that
you
were
good
i
did
get
a
chance
of
showing
what
i
could
do
he
explained
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
mr
bevan
nodded
his
head
thoughtfully
so
naturally
concluded
sheen
the
thing
has
put
me
out
a
bit
beastly
having
nothing
to
work
for
i
at
a
loose
end
up
till
now
i
always
had
the
thought
of
the
house
competition
to
keep
me
going
but
now
well
you
see
how
it
is
it
like
running
to
catch
a
train
and
then
finding
suddenly
that
you
got
plenty
of
time
there
seem
any
point
in
going
on
running
why
not
aldershot
sir
said
mr
bevan
what
cried
sheen
the
absolute
novelty
of
the
idea
and
the
gorgeous
possibilities
of
it
made
him
tingle
from
head
to
foot
aldershot
why
had
he
thought
of
it
before
the
house
competition
suddenly
lost
its
importance
in
his
eyes
it
was
a
trivial
affair
after
all
compared
with
aldershot
that
mecca
of
the
boxer
then
the
glow
began
to
fade
doubts
crept
in
he
might
have
learned
a
good
deal
from
joe
bevan
but
had
he
learned
enough
to
be
able
to
hold
his
own
with
the
best
boxers
of
all
the
public
schools
in
the
country
and
if
he
had
the
skill
to
win
had
he
the
heart
joe
bevan
had
said
that
he
would
not
disgrace
himself
again
and
he
felt
that
the
chances
were
against
his
doing
so
but
there
was
the
terrible
possibility
he
had
stood
up
to
francis
and
the
others
and
he
had
taken
their
blows
without
flinching
but
in
these
encounters
there
was
always
at
the
back
of
his
mind
the
comforting
feeling
that
there
was
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
punishment
he
would
receive
if
francis
happened
to
drive
him
into
a
corner
where
he
could
neither
attack
nor
defend
himself
against
attack
he
did
not
use
his
advantage
to
the
full
he
indicated
rather
than
used
it
a
couple
of
blows
and
he
moved
out
into
the
open
again
but
in
the
public
schools
competition
at
aldershot
there
would
be
no
quarter
there
would
be
nothing
but
deadly
earnest
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
manoeuvred
into
an
awkward
position
only
his
own
skill
or
the
call
of
time
could
extricate
him
from
it
in
a
word
at
the
blue
boar
he
sparred
at
aldershot
he
would
have
to
fight
was
he
capable
of
fighting
then
there
was
another
difficulty
how
was
he
to
get
himself
appointed
as
the
wrykyn
representative
now
that
drummond
was
unable
to
box
stanning
would
go
down
as
the
winner
of
the
school
competition
these
things
were
worked
by
an
automatic
process
sheen
felt
that
he
could
beat
stanning
but
he
had
no
means
of
publishing
this
fact
to
the
school
he
could
not
challenge
him
to
a
trial
of
skill
that
sort
of
thing
was
not
done
he
explained
this
to
joe
bevan
well
it
a
pity
said
joe
regretfully
it
a
pity
at
this
moment
jack
bruce
appeared
what
a
pity
joe
he
asked
joe
wants
me
to
go
to
aldershot
as
a
explained
sheen
and
i
was
just
saying
that
i
could
because
of
stanning
what
about
stanning
he
won
the
school
competition
you
see
so
they
bound
to
send
him
down
half
a
minute
said
jack
bruce
i
never
thought
of
aldershot
for
you
before
it
a
jolly
good
idea
i
believe
you
have
a
chance
and
all
right
about
stanning
he
not
going
down
have
you
heard
i
do
hear
anything
why
is
he
going
down
he
knocked
up
one
of
his
wrists
so
he
says
how
do
you
mean
so
he
says
asked
sheen
i
believe
he
funks
it
why
what
makes
you
think
that
oh
i
do
know
it
only
my
opinion
still
it
a
little
queer
stanning
says
he
crocked
his
left
wrist
in
the
final
of
the
house
competition
well
what
wrong
with
that
why
should
he
have
done
so
sheen
objected
strongly
to
stanning
but
he
had
the
elements
of
justice
in
him
and
he
was
not
going
to
condemn
him
on
insufficient
evidence
particularly
of
a
crime
of
which
he
himself
had
been
guilty
of
course
he
may
have
done
said
bruce
but
it
a
bit
fishy
that
he
should
have
been
playing
fives
all
right
two
days
running
just
after
the
competition
he
might
have
crocked
himself
then
then
why
did
he
say
so
a
question
which
sheen
found
himself
unable
to
answer
then
there
nothing
to
prevent
you
fighting
sir
said
joe
bevan
who
had
been
listening
attentively
to
the
conversation
do
you
really
think
i
got
a
chance
i
do
sir
of
course
you
have
said
jack
bruce
you
quite
as
good
as
drummond
was
last
time
i
saw
him
box
then
i
have
a
shot
at
it
said
sheen
good
for
you
sir
cried
joe
bevan
though
it
be
a
bit
of
a
job
getting
leave
said
sheen
how
would
you
start
about
it
bruce
you
better
ask
spence
he
the
man
to
go
to
that
all
right
i
rather
a
pal
of
spence
ask
him
tonight
after
suggested
bruce
and
then
you
can
come
here
regular
said
joe
bevan
and
we
train
you
till
you
that
fit
you
could
eat
bricks
and
you
make
babies
of
them
up
at
aldershot
xix
paving
the
way
bruce
had
been
perfectly
correct
in
his
suspicions
stanning
wrist
was
no
more
sprained
than
his
ankle
the
advisability
of
manufacturing
an
injury
had
come
home
to
him
very
vividly
on
the
saturday
morning
following
the
ripton
match
when
he
had
read
the
brief
report
of
that
painful
episode
in
that
week
number
of
the
in
the
school
library
in
the
list
of
the
ripton
team
appeared
the
name
peteiro
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
dusky
riptonian
when
drummond
had
beaten
him
in
the
the
year
before
drummond
had
returned
from
aldershot
on
that
occasion
cheerful
but
in
an
extremely
battered
condition
his
appearance
as
he
limped
about
the
field
on
sports
day
had
been
heroic
and
in
addition
a
fine
advertisement
for
the
punishing
powers
of
the
ripton
champion
it
is
true
that
at
least
one
of
his
injuries
had
been
the
work
of
a
pauline
whom
he
had
met
in
the
opening
bout
but
the
great
majority
were
presents
from
ripton
and
drummond
had
described
the
dusky
one
in
no
uncertain
terms
as
a
holy
terror
these
things
had
sunk
into
stanning
mind
it
had
been
generally
understood
at
wrykyn
that
peteiro
had
left
school
at
christmas
when
stanning
through
his
study
of
the
discovered
that
the
redoubtable
boxer
had
been
one
of
the
team
against
which
he
had
played
at
ripton
and
realised
that
owing
to
drummond
illness
it
would
fall
to
him
if
he
won
the
house
competition
to
meet
this
man
of
wrath
at
aldershot
he
resolved
on
the
instant
that
the
most
persuasive
of
wild
horses
should
not
draw
him
to
that
military
centre
on
the
day
of
the
public
schools
competition
the
difficulty
was
that
he
particularly
wished
to
win
the
house
cup
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
combine
the
two
things
win
the
competition
and
get
injured
while
doing
so
accordingly
two
days
after
the
house
boxing
he
was
observed
to
issue
from
appleby
with
his
left
arm
slung
in
a
first
fifteen
scarf
he
was
too
astute
to
injure
his
right
wrist
what
happens
to
one
left
wrist
at
school
is
one
own
private
business
when
one
injures
one
right
arm
and
so
incapacitates
oneself
for
form
work
the
authorities
begin
to
make
awkward
investigations
mr
spence
who
looked
after
the
school
efforts
to
win
medals
at
aldershot
was
the
most
disappointed
person
in
the
place
he
was
an
enthusiastic
boxer
he
had
represented
cambridge
in
the
in
his
day
and
with
no
small
trouble
had
succeeded
in
making
boxing
a
going
concern
at
wrykyn
years
of
failure
had
ended
the
easter
before
in
a
huge
triumph
when
of
dexter
and
drummond
had
won
silver
medals
and
moriarty
of
dexter
a
bronze
if
only
somebody
could
win
a
medal
this
year
the
tradition
would
be
established
and
would
not
soon
die
out
unfortunately
there
was
not
a
great
deal
of
boxing
talent
in
the
school
just
now
the
rule
that
the
winner
at
his
weight
in
the
house
competitions
should
represent
the
school
at
aldershot
only
applied
if
the
winner
were
fairly
proficient
mr
spence
exercised
his
discretion
it
was
no
use
sending
down
novices
to
be
massacred
this
year
drummond
and
stanning
were
the
only
wrykinians
up
to
aldershot
form
drummond
would
have
been
almost
a
certainty
for
a
silver
medal
and
stanning
would
probably
have
been
a
and
here
they
were
both
injured
wrykyn
would
not
have
a
single
representative
at
the
queen
avenue
gymnasium
it
would
be
a
to
the
cult
of
boxing
at
the
school
mr
spence
was
pondering
over
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
when
sheen
was
shown
in
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
sir
said
sheen
certainly
sheen
take
one
of
those
cig
i
mean
sit
down
what
is
it
sheen
had
decided
how
to
open
the
interview
before
knocking
at
the
door
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
do
you
think
i
could
go
down
to
aldershot
sir
he
asked
mr
spence
looked
surprised
go
down
you
mean
do
you
want
to
watch
the
competition
really
i
do
know
if
the
headmaster
i
mean
can
i
box
mr
spence
look
of
surprise
became
more
marked
box
he
said
but
surely
i
did
know
you
were
a
boxer
sheen
i
only
taken
it
up
lately
but
you
did
enter
for
the
house
competitions
did
you
what
weight
are
you
just
under
ten
stone
a
why
linton
boxed
for
your
house
in
the
surely
yes
sir
they
would
let
me
go
in
you
hurt
yourself
no
sir
then
why
would
they
let
you
go
in
drummond
thought
linton
was
better
he
did
know
i
boxed
but
this
is
very
curious
i
do
understand
it
at
all
you
see
if
you
were
not
up
to
house
form
you
would
hardly
at
aldershot
you
see
you
would
meet
the
best
boxers
of
all
the
public
schools
yes
sir
there
was
a
pause
it
was
like
this
sir
said
sheen
nervously
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
there
was
a
bit
of
a
row
down
in
the
town
and
i
got
mixed
up
in
it
and
i
did
i
was
afraid
to
join
in
i
funked
it
mr
spence
nodded
he
was
deeply
interested
now
the
office
of
confessor
is
always
interesting
go
on
sheen
what
happened
then
i
was
cut
by
everybody
the
fellows
thought
i
had
let
the
house
down
and
it
got
about
and
the
other
houses
scored
off
them
so
i
had
rather
a
rotten
time
here
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
telling
his
story
without
that
attention
to
polite
phraseology
which
a
master
expects
from
a
boy
so
he
amended
the
last
sentence
i
did
have
a
very
pleasant
time
sir
was
his
correction
well
said
mr
spence
so
i
was
a
bit
sick
continued
sheen
relapsing
once
more
into
the
vernacular
and
i
wanted
to
do
something
to
put
things
right
again
and
i
met
anyhow
i
took
up
boxing
i
wanted
to
box
for
the
house
if
i
was
good
enough
i
practised
every
day
and
stuck
to
it
and
after
a
bit
i
did
become
pretty
good
well
then
drummond
got
mumps
and
i
wrote
to
him
asking
if
i
might
represent
the
house
instead
of
him
and
i
suppose
he
did
believe
i
was
any
good
at
any
rate
he
would
let
me
go
in
then
joe
a
man
who
knows
something
about
boxing
suggested
i
should
go
down
to
aldershot
joe
said
mr
spence
inquiringly
sheen
had
let
the
name
slip
out
unintentionally
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
recall
it
joe
bevan
sir
he
said
he
used
to
be
champion
of
england
joe
bevan
cried
mr
spence
really
why
he
trained
me
when
i
boxed
for
cambridge
he
one
of
the
best
of
fellows
i
never
seen
any
one
who
took
such
trouble
with
his
man
i
wish
we
could
get
him
here
so
it
was
joe
who
suggested
that
you
should
go
down
to
aldershot
well
he
ought
to
know
did
he
say
you
would
have
a
good
chance
yes
sir
my
position
is
this
you
see
sheen
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
more
than
to
see
the
school
represented
at
aldershot
but
i
can
not
let
anyone
go
down
irrespective
of
his
abilities
aldershot
is
not
play
and
in
the
you
get
the
hardest
fighting
of
all
it
would
do
for
me
to
let
you
go
down
if
you
are
not
up
to
the
proper
form
you
would
be
half
killed
i
should
like
to
have
a
shot
sir
said
sheen
then
this
year
as
you
probably
know
ripton
are
sending
down
peteiro
for
the
he
was
the
fellow
whom
drummond
only
just
beat
last
year
and
you
saw
the
state
in
which
drummond
came
back
if
drummond
could
hardly
hold
him
what
would
you
do
i
believe
i
could
beat
drummond
sir
said
sheen
mr
spence
eyes
opened
wider
here
were
brave
words
this
youth
evidently
meant
business
the
thing
puzzled
him
on
the
one
hand
sheen
had
been
cut
by
his
house
for
cowardice
on
the
other
joe
bevan
who
of
all
men
was
best
able
to
judge
had
told
him
that
he
was
good
enough
to
box
at
aldershot
let
me
think
it
over
sheen
he
said
this
is
a
matter
which
i
can
not
decide
in
a
moment
i
will
tell
you
tomorrow
what
i
think
about
it
i
hope
you
will
let
me
go
down
sir
said
sheen
it
my
one
chance
yes
yes
i
see
that
i
see
that
said
mr
spence
but
all
the
same
well
i
will
think
it
over
all
the
rest
of
that
evening
he
pondered
over
the
matter
deeply
perplexed
it
would
be
nothing
less
than
cruel
to
let
sheen
enter
the
ring
at
aldershot
if
he
were
incompetent
boxing
in
the
public
schools
boxing
competition
is
not
a
pastime
for
the
incompetent
but
he
wished
very
much
that
wrykyn
should
be
represented
and
also
he
sympathised
with
sheen
eagerness
to
wipe
out
the
stain
on
his
honour
and
the
honour
of
the
house
but
like
drummond
he
could
not
help
harbouring
a
suspicion
that
this
was
a
pose
he
felt
that
sheen
was
intoxicated
by
his
imagination
every
one
likes
to
picture
himself
doing
dashing
things
in
the
limelight
with
an
appreciative
multitude
to
applaud
would
this
mood
stand
the
test
of
action
against
this
there
was
the
evidence
of
joe
bevan
joe
had
said
that
sheen
was
worthy
to
fight
for
his
school
and
joe
knew
mr
spence
went
to
bed
still
in
a
state
of
doubt
next
morning
he
hit
upon
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
wandering
in
the
grounds
before
school
he
came
upon
who
as
has
been
stated
before
had
won
the
at
aldershot
in
the
previous
year
he
had
come
to
wrykyn
for
the
sports
here
was
the
man
to
help
him
should
put
on
the
gloves
with
sheen
and
report
i
in
rather
a
difficulty
he
said
and
you
can
help
me
what
that
inquired
you
know
both
our
are
on
the
sick
list
i
had
just
resigned
myself
to
going
down
to
aldershot
without
any
one
to
box
when
a
boy
in
seymour
volunteered
for
the
vacant
place
i
do
know
if
you
knew
him
at
school
sheen
do
you
remember
him
sheen
cried
in
amazement
not
his
recollections
of
sheen
were
not
conducive
to
a
picture
of
him
as
a
boxer
yes
i
had
never
heard
of
him
as
a
boxer
still
he
seems
very
anxious
to
go
down
and
he
certainly
has
one
remarkable
testimonial
and
as
there
no
one
else
and
what
shall
i
do
asked
i
want
you
if
you
will
to
give
him
a
trial
in
the
just
see
if
he
any
good
at
all
if
he
is
of
course
do
hit
him
about
a
great
deal
but
if
he
shows
signs
of
being
a
useful
man
extend
him
see
what
he
can
do
very
well
sir
said
and
you
might
look
in
at
my
house
at
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
at
five
when
he
entered
mr
spence
study
face
wore
the
look
of
one
who
had
seen
visions
well
said
mr
spence
did
you
find
him
any
good
good
said
he
beat
them
all
he
a
champion
no
stopping
him
what
an
extraordinary
thing
said
mr
spence
xx
sheen
goes
to
aldershot
at
sheen
request
mr
spence
made
no
announcement
of
the
fact
that
wrykyn
would
be
represented
in
the
it
would
be
time
enough
sheen
felt
for
the
school
to
know
that
he
was
a
boxer
when
he
had
been
down
and
shown
what
he
could
do
his
appearance
in
his
new
role
would
be
the
most
surprising
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
place
for
years
and
it
would
be
a
painful
if
after
all
the
excitement
which
would
be
caused
by
the
discovery
that
he
could
use
his
hands
he
were
to
be
defeated
in
his
first
bout
whereas
if
he
happened
to
win
the
announcement
of
his
victory
would
be
all
the
more
impressive
coming
unexpectedly
to
himself
he
did
not
admit
the
possibility
of
defeat
he
had
braced
himself
up
for
the
ordeal
and
he
refused
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
might
not
come
out
of
it
well
besides
joe
bevan
continued
to
express
hopeful
opinions
just
you
keep
your
head
sir
he
said
and
you
win
lots
of
these
gentlemen
they
champions
when
they
practising
and
you
think
nothing
would
stop
them
when
they
get
into
the
ring
but
they
get
wild
directly
they
begin
and
forget
everything
they
been
taught
and
where
are
they
then
why
on
the
floor
waiting
for
the
referee
to
count
them
out
this
picture
might
have
encouraged
sheen
more
if
he
had
not
reflected
that
he
was
just
as
likely
to
fall
into
this
error
as
were
his
opponents
what
you
want
to
remember
is
to
keep
that
guard
up
nothing
can
beat
that
and
push
out
your
left
straight
the
straight
left
rules
the
boxing
world
and
be
earnest
about
it
be
as
friendly
as
you
like
afterwards
but
while
you
in
the
ring
say
to
yourself
you
or
me
and
do
be
too
kind
i
wish
you
could
come
down
to
second
me
joe
said
sheen
i
have
a
jolly
good
try
sir
said
joe
bevan
let
me
see
be
going
down
the
night
before
i
ca
come
down
then
but
i
try
and
manage
it
by
an
early
train
on
the
day
how
about
francis
oh
francis
can
look
after
himself
for
one
day
he
not
the
sort
of
boy
to
run
wild
if
he
left
alone
for
a
few
hours
then
you
think
you
can
manage
it
yes
sir
if
i
not
there
for
your
first
fight
i
shall
come
in
time
to
second
you
in
the
final
if
i
get
there
said
sheen
good
seconding
half
the
battle
these
soldiers
they
give
you
at
aldershot
well
they
do
know
the
business
as
the
saying
is
they
do
look
after
their
man
not
like
i
could
i
saw
young
of
rugby
stevens
he
was
beaten
in
the
final
by
a
gentleman
from
harrow
i
saw
him
fight
there
a
couple
of
years
ago
after
the
first
round
he
was
leading
not
by
much
but
still
he
was
a
point
or
two
ahead
well
he
went
to
his
corner
and
his
seconds
sent
him
up
for
the
next
round
in
the
same
state
he
got
there
in
they
had
done
a
thing
to
him
why
if
i
been
in
his
corner
i
have
taken
him
and
sponged
him
and
sent
him
up
again
as
fresh
as
he
could
be
you
must
have
a
good
second
if
you
to
win
when
you
all
on
top
of
your
man
i
do
say
but
you
get
a
young
gentleman
of
your
own
class
just
about
as
quick
and
strong
as
you
are
and
then
you
know
where
the
seconding
comes
in
then
for
goodness
sake
do
make
any
mistake
about
coming
down
said
sheen
i
be
there
sir
said
joe
bevan
the
queen
avenue
gymnasium
at
aldershot
is
a
roomy
place
but
it
is
always
crowded
on
the
public
schools
day
sisters
and
cousins
and
aunts
of
competitors
flock
there
to
see
tommy
or
bobby
perform
under
the
impression
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
he
is
about
to
take
part
in
a
pleasant
frolic
a
sort
of
merry
parlour
game
what
their
opinion
is
after
he
emerges
from
a
warm
three
rounds
is
not
known
then
there
are
soldiers
in
scores
their
views
on
boxing
as
a
sport
are
crisp
and
easily
defined
what
they
want
is
gore
others
of
the
spectators
are
old
boys
come
to
see
how
the
school
can
behave
in
an
emergency
and
to
find
out
whether
there
are
still
experts
like
jones
who
won
the
middles
in
or
robinson
who
was
in
the
feathers
in
the
same
year
or
whether
as
they
have
darkly
suspected
for
some
time
the
school
has
gone
to
the
dogs
since
they
left
the
usual
crowd
was
gathered
in
the
seats
round
the
ring
when
sheen
came
out
of
the
and
sat
down
in
an
obscure
corner
at
the
end
of
the
barrier
which
divides
the
gymnasium
into
two
parts
on
these
occasions
he
felt
very
lonely
mr
spence
and
the
school
instructor
were
watching
the
gymnastics
which
had
just
started
upon
their
lengthy
course
the
wrykyn
pair
were
not
expected
to
figure
high
on
the
list
this
year
he
could
have
joined
mr
spence
but
at
the
moment
he
felt
disinclined
for
conversation
if
he
had
been
a
more
enthusiastic
cricketer
he
would
have
recognised
the
feeling
as
that
which
attacks
a
batsman
before
he
goes
to
the
wicket
it
is
not
precisely
funk
it
is
rather
a
desire
to
accelerate
the
flight
of
time
and
get
to
business
quickly
all
things
come
to
him
who
waits
and
among
them
is
that
unpleasant
sensation
of
a
cold
hand
upon
the
portion
of
the
body
which
lies
behind
the
third
waistcoat
button
the
boxing
had
begun
with
a
bout
between
two
both
obviously
suffering
from
they
were
fighting
in
a
scrambling
and
unscientific
manner
which
bore
out
mr
statements
on
the
subject
of
losing
one
head
sheen
felt
that
both
were
capable
of
better
things
in
the
second
and
third
rounds
this
proved
to
be
the
case
and
the
contest
came
to
an
end
amidst
applause
the
next
pair
were
and
sheen
settled
himself
to
watch
more
attentively
from
these
he
would
gather
some
indication
of
what
he
might
expect
to
find
when
he
entered
the
ring
he
would
not
have
to
fight
for
some
time
yet
in
the
drawing
for
numbers
which
had
taken
place
in
the
he
had
picked
a
three
there
would
be
another
battle
before
he
was
called
upon
his
opponent
was
a
tonbridgian
who
from
the
glimpse
sheen
caught
of
him
seemed
muscular
but
he
sheen
had
the
advantage
in
reach
and
built
on
that
after
opening
tamely
the
bout
had
become
vigorous
in
the
second
round
and
both
men
had
apparently
forgotten
that
their
right
arms
had
been
given
them
by
nature
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
they
were
going
at
it
in
hurricane
fashion
all
over
the
ring
sheen
was
horrified
to
feel
symptoms
of
a
return
of
that
old
sensation
of
panic
which
had
caused
him
on
that
dark
day
early
in
the
term
to
flee
albert
and
his
wicked
works
he
set
his
teeth
and
fought
it
down
and
after
a
bad
minute
he
was
able
to
argue
himself
into
a
proper
frame
of
mind
again
after
all
that
sort
of
thing
looked
much
worse
than
it
really
was
half
those
blows
which
seemed
as
if
they
must
do
tremendous
damage
were
probably
hardly
felt
by
their
recipient
he
told
himself
that
francis
and
even
the
boy
hit
fully
as
hard
or
harder
and
he
had
never
minded
them
at
the
end
of
the
contest
he
was
once
more
looking
forward
to
his
entrance
to
the
ring
with
proper
fortitude
the
fighting
was
going
briskly
forward
now
sometimes
good
sometimes
moderate
but
always
earnest
and
he
found
himself
contemplating
without
undue
excitement
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
the
bout
which
had
just
begun
between
from
st
paul
and
wellington
it
would
be
his
turn
to
perform
as
luck
would
have
it
he
had
not
so
long
to
wait
as
he
had
expected
for
the
pauline
taking
the
lead
after
the
first
few
exchanges
his
man
so
completely
that
the
referee
stopped
the
contest
in
the
second
round
sheen
got
up
from
his
corner
and
went
to
the
the
tonbridgian
was
already
there
he
took
off
his
coat
somebody
crammed
his
hands
into
the
gloves
and
from
that
moment
the
last
trace
of
nervousness
left
him
he
trembled
with
the
excitement
of
the
thing
and
hoped
sincerely
that
no
one
would
notice
it
and
think
that
he
was
afraid
then
amidst
a
clapping
of
hands
which
sounded
faint
and
he
followed
his
opponent
to
the
ring
and
ducked
under
the
ropes
the
referee
consulted
a
paper
which
he
held
and
announced
the
names
sheen
wrykyn
college
sheen
wriggled
his
fingers
right
into
the
gloves
and
thought
of
joe
bevan
what
had
joe
said
keep
that
guard
up
the
straight
left
keep
that
guard
the
straight
left
keep
that
bird
tonbridge
school
there
was
a
fresh
outburst
of
applause
the
tonbridgian
had
shown
up
well
in
the
competition
of
the
previous
year
and
the
crowd
welcomed
him
as
an
old
friend
keep
that
guard
up
straight
left
straight
left
guard
up
seconds
out
of
the
ring
guard
up
not
too
high
straight
left
it
beats
the
world
what
an
age
that
man
was
calling
time
guard
up
straight
time
said
the
referee
sheen
filled
with
a
great
calm
walked
out
of
his
corner
and
shook
hands
with
his
opponent
xxi
a
good
start
it
was
all
over
in
half
a
minute
the
tonbridgian
was
a
fighter
of
the
rushing
type
almost
immediately
after
he
had
shaken
hands
sheen
found
himself
against
the
ropes
blinking
from
a
heavy
hit
between
the
eyes
through
the
mist
he
saw
his
opponent
sparring
up
to
him
and
as
he
hit
he
the
next
moment
he
was
out
in
the
middle
again
with
his
man
pressing
him
hard
there
was
a
quick
rally
and
then
sheen
swung
his
right
at
a
venture
the
blow
had
no
conscious
aim
it
was
purely
speculative
but
it
succeeded
the
tonbridgian
fell
with
a
thud
sheen
drew
back
the
thing
seemed
pathetic
he
had
braced
himself
up
for
a
long
fight
and
it
had
ended
in
half
a
minute
his
sensations
were
mixed
the
fighting
half
of
him
was
praying
that
his
man
would
get
up
and
start
again
the
prudent
half
realised
that
it
was
best
that
he
should
stay
down
he
had
other
fights
before
him
before
he
could
call
that
silver
medal
his
own
and
this
would
give
him
an
invaluable
start
in
the
race
his
rivals
had
all
had
to
battle
hard
in
their
opening
bouts
the
tonbridgian
rigidity
had
given
place
to
spasmodic
efforts
to
rise
he
got
on
one
knee
and
his
gloved
hand
roamed
feebly
about
in
search
of
a
hold
it
was
plain
that
he
had
shot
his
bolt
the
referee
signed
to
his
seconds
who
ducked
into
the
ring
and
carried
him
to
his
corner
sheen
walked
back
to
his
own
corner
and
sat
down
presently
the
referee
called
out
his
name
as
the
winner
and
he
went
across
the
ring
and
shook
hands
with
his
opponent
who
was
now
himself
again
he
overheard
snatches
of
conversation
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
useful
boxer
that
wrykyn
boy
shortest
fight
i
seen
here
since
hopley
won
the
fluke
do
you
think
do
know
came
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
anyhow
caught
him
fair
hard
luck
on
that
tonbridge
man
he
a
good
boxer
really
did
well
here
last
year
then
an
outburst
of
drowned
the
speakers
voices
a
swarthy
youth
with
the
ripton
pink
and
green
on
his
vest
had
pushed
past
him
and
was
entering
the
ring
as
he
entered
the
he
heard
the
referee
announcing
the
names
so
that
was
the
famous
peteiro
sheen
admitted
to
himself
that
he
looked
tough
and
hurried
into
his
coat
and
out
of
the
again
so
as
to
be
in
time
to
see
how
the
ripton
terror
shaped
it
was
plainly
not
a
encounter
peteiro
opponent
hailed
from
st
paul
a
school
that
has
a
habit
of
turning
out
boxers
at
the
end
of
the
first
round
it
seemed
that
honours
were
even
the
great
peteiro
had
taken
as
much
as
he
had
given
and
once
had
been
uncompromisingly
floored
by
the
pauline
left
but
in
the
second
round
he
began
to
gain
points
for
a
boy
of
his
weight
he
had
a
terrific
hit
with
the
right
and
three
applications
of
this
to
the
ribs
early
in
the
round
took
much
of
the
sting
out
of
the
pauline
blows
he
fought
on
with
undiminished
pluck
but
the
riptonian
was
too
strong
for
him
and
the
third
round
was
a
rout
to
quote
the
of
the
following
day
peteiro
crowded
in
a
lot
of
work
with
both
hands
and
scored
a
popular
victory
sheen
looked
thoughtful
at
the
conclusion
of
the
fight
there
was
no
doubt
that
drummond
antagonist
of
the
previous
year
was
formidable
yet
sheen
believed
himself
to
be
the
cleverer
of
the
two
at
any
rate
peteiro
had
given
no
signs
of
possessing
much
cunning
to
all
appearances
he
was
a
tough
fighter
with
a
right
which
would
drill
a
hole
in
a
steel
plate
had
he
sufficient
skill
to
baffle
his
sheen
strong
tactics
if
only
joe
bevan
would
come
with
joe
in
his
corner
to
direct
him
he
would
feel
safe
but
of
joe
up
to
the
present
there
were
no
signs
mr
spence
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
well
sheen
he
said
so
you
won
your
first
fight
keep
it
up
i
try
sir
said
sheen
what
do
you
think
of
peteiro
i
was
just
wondering
sir
he
hits
very
hard
very
hard
indeed
but
he
does
look
as
if
he
was
very
clever
not
a
bit
just
a
plain
slogger
that
all
that
why
drummond
beat
him
last
year
in
the
in
strength
there
was
no
comparison
but
drummond
was
just
too
clever
for
him
you
will
be
the
same
sheen
i
hope
so
sir
said
sheen
after
lunch
the
second
act
of
the
performance
began
sheen
had
to
meet
a
boxer
from
harrow
who
had
drawn
a
bye
in
the
first
round
of
the
competition
this
proved
a
harder
fight
than
his
first
encounter
but
by
virtue
of
a
stout
heart
and
a
straight
left
he
came
through
it
successfully
and
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
decision
would
be
both
judges
voted
for
him
peteiro
demolished
a
radleian
in
his
next
fight
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
there
were
three
in
the
running
sheen
peteiro
and
a
boy
from
clifton
sheen
drew
the
bye
and
sparred
in
an
outer
room
with
a
soldier
who
was
inclined
to
take
the
thing
easily
sheen
with
the
thought
of
the
final
in
his
mind
was
only
too
ready
to
oblige
him
they
sparred
an
innocuous
three
rounds
and
the
man
of
war
was
kind
enough
to
whisper
in
his
ear
as
they
left
the
room
that
he
hoped
he
would
win
the
final
and
that
he
himself
had
a
matter
of
with
old
spud
smith
on
his
success
for
i
a
man
said
the
amiable
warrior
confidentially
as
knows
class
when
he
sees
it
you
class
sir
that
what
you
are
this
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
fact
that
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
had
at
any
rate
won
a
medal
by
having
got
into
the
final
cheered
sheen
if
only
joe
bevan
had
appeared
he
would
have
been
perfectly
contented
but
there
were
no
signs
of
joe
xxii
a
good
finish
final
shouted
the
referee
a
murmur
of
interest
from
the
chairs
sheen
wrykyn
college
sheen
got
his
full
measure
of
applause
this
time
his
victories
in
the
preliminary
bouts
had
won
him
favour
with
the
spectators
peteiro
ripton
school
go
it
ripton
cried
a
voice
from
near
the
door
the
referee
frowned
in
the
direction
of
this
audacious
partisan
and
expressed
a
hope
that
the
audience
would
kindly
refrain
from
comment
during
the
rounds
then
he
turned
to
the
ring
again
and
announced
the
names
a
second
time
sheen
peteiro
the
ripton
man
was
sitting
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
listening
to
the
advice
of
his
school
instructor
who
had
thrust
head
and
shoulders
through
the
ropes
and
was
busy
impressing
some
point
upon
him
sheen
found
himself
noticing
the
most
trivial
things
with
extraordinary
clearness
in
the
front
row
of
the
spectators
sat
a
man
with
a
tie
he
wondered
idly
what
tie
it
was
it
was
rather
like
one
worn
by
members
of
templar
house
at
wrykyn
why
were
the
ropes
of
the
ring
red
he
rather
liked
the
colour
there
was
a
man
lighting
a
pipe
would
he
blow
out
the
match
or
extinguish
it
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
what
a
beast
peteiro
looked
he
really
was
a
nigger
he
must
look
out
for
that
right
of
his
the
straight
left
push
it
out
straight
left
ruled
the
boxing
world
where
was
joe
he
must
have
missed
the
train
or
perhaps
he
had
been
able
to
get
away
why
did
he
want
to
yawn
he
wondered
time
the
ripton
man
became
suddenly
active
he
almost
ran
across
the
ring
a
brief
handshake
and
he
had
penned
sheen
up
in
his
corner
before
he
had
time
to
leave
it
it
was
evident
what
advice
his
instructor
had
been
giving
him
he
meant
to
force
the
pace
from
the
start
the
suddenness
of
it
threw
sheen
momentarily
off
his
balance
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
whirl
of
blows
a
sharp
shock
from
behind
he
had
run
up
against
the
post
despite
everything
he
remembered
to
keep
his
guard
up
and
stopped
a
lashing
hit
from
his
antagonist
left
but
he
was
too
late
to
keep
out
his
right
in
it
came
full
on
the
weakest
spot
on
his
left
side
the
pain
of
it
caused
him
to
double
up
for
an
instant
and
as
he
did
so
his
opponent
him
there
was
no
rest
for
him
nothing
that
he
had
ever
experienced
with
the
gloves
on
approached
this
if
only
he
could
get
out
of
this
corner
then
almost
unconsciously
he
recalled
joe
bevan
advice
if
a
man
got
you
in
a
corner
joe
had
said
fall
on
him
peteiro
made
another
savage
swing
sheen
dodged
it
and
hurled
himself
forward
break
away
said
a
dispassionate
official
voice
sheen
broke
away
but
now
he
was
out
of
the
corner
with
the
whole
good
open
ring
to
manoeuvre
in
he
could
just
see
the
ripton
instructor
signalling
violently
to
his
opponent
and
in
reply
to
the
signals
peteiro
came
on
again
with
another
fierce
rush
but
sheen
in
the
open
was
a
different
person
from
sheen
cooped
up
in
a
corner
francis
hunt
had
taught
him
to
use
his
feet
he
and
turning
quickly
found
his
man
staggering
past
him
by
the
force
of
his
wasted
blow
and
now
it
was
sheen
who
attacked
and
peteiro
who
tried
to
escape
two
swift
hits
he
got
in
before
his
opponent
could
face
round
and
another
as
he
turned
and
rushed
then
for
a
while
the
battle
raged
without
science
all
over
the
ring
gradually
with
a
cold
feeling
of
dismay
sheen
realised
that
his
strength
was
going
the
pace
was
too
hot
he
could
not
keep
it
up
his
left
counters
were
losing
their
force
now
he
was
merely
pushing
his
glove
into
the
ripton
man
face
it
was
not
enough
the
other
was
getting
to
close
quarters
and
that
right
of
his
seemed
stronger
than
ever
he
was
against
the
ropes
now
gasping
for
breath
and
peteiro
right
was
thudding
against
his
ribs
it
could
not
last
he
gathered
all
his
strength
and
put
it
into
a
straight
left
it
took
the
ripton
man
in
the
throat
and
drove
him
back
a
step
he
came
on
again
again
sheen
stopped
him
it
was
his
last
effort
he
could
do
no
more
everything
seemed
black
to
him
he
leaned
against
the
ropes
and
drank
in
the
air
in
great
gulps
time
said
the
referee
the
word
was
lost
in
the
shouts
that
rose
from
the
packed
seats
sheen
tottered
to
his
corner
and
sat
down
keep
it
up
sir
keep
it
up
said
a
voice
that
the
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
do
forget
the
guard
and
the
straight
left
beats
the
world
it
was
joe
at
the
eleventh
hour
with
a
delicious
feeling
of
content
sheen
leaned
back
in
his
chair
it
would
be
all
right
now
he
felt
that
the
matter
had
been
taken
out
of
his
hands
a
more
experienced
brain
than
his
would
look
after
the
generalship
of
the
fight
as
the
moments
of
the
rest
slid
away
he
discovered
the
truth
of
joe
remarks
on
the
value
of
a
good
second
in
his
other
fights
the
napping
of
the
towel
had
hardly
stirred
the
hair
on
his
forehead
joe
energetic
arms
set
a
perfect
gale
blowing
the
cool
air
revived
him
he
opened
his
mouth
and
drank
it
in
a
spongeful
of
cold
water
completed
the
cure
long
before
the
call
of
time
he
was
ready
for
the
next
round
keep
away
from
him
sir
said
joe
and
score
with
that
left
of
yours
do
try
the
right
yet
keep
it
for
guarding
box
clever
let
him
corner
you
slip
him
when
he
rushes
cool
and
steady
does
it
do
aim
at
his
face
too
much
go
down
below
that
the
and
use
your
feet
get
about
quick
and
you
find
he
do
like
that
hullo
says
he
i
ca
touch
him
then
when
tired
go
in
the
pupil
nodded
with
closed
eyes
while
these
words
of
wisdom
were
proceeding
from
the
mouth
of
mr
bevan
another
conversation
was
taking
place
which
would
have
interested
sheen
if
he
could
have
heard
it
mr
spence
and
the
school
instructor
were
watching
the
final
from
the
seats
under
the
side
windows
it
extraordinary
said
mr
spence
the
boy
wonderfully
good
for
the
short
time
he
has
been
learning
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
your
pupil
sir
i
was
saying
that
sheen
does
you
credit
not
me
sir
what
he
told
me
he
had
been
taking
lessons
did
you
teach
him
never
set
eyes
on
him
till
this
moment
wish
i
had
sir
he
the
sort
of
pupil
i
could
wish
for
mr
spence
bent
forward
and
scanned
the
features
of
the
man
who
was
attending
the
wrykinian
why
he
said
surely
that
bevan
joe
bevan
i
knew
him
at
cambridge
yes
sir
that
bevan
replied
the
instructor
he
teaches
boxing
at
wrykyn
now
sir
at
wrykyn
where
up
the
river
at
the
boar
sir
said
the
instructor
quite
innocently
for
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
this
simple
little
bit
of
information
was
just
so
much
incriminating
evidence
against
sheen
mr
spence
said
nothing
but
he
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
recalling
his
recent
conversation
with
sheen
he
remembered
that
the
boy
had
told
him
he
had
been
taking
lessons
and
also
that
joe
bevan
the
had
expressed
a
high
opinion
of
his
work
mr
spence
had
imagined
that
bevan
had
been
a
chance
spectator
of
the
boy
skill
but
it
would
now
seem
that
bevan
himself
had
taught
sheen
this
matter
decided
mr
spence
must
be
looked
into
for
it
was
palpable
that
sheen
had
broken
bounds
in
order
to
attend
bevan
up
the
river
for
the
present
however
mr
spence
was
content
to
say
nothing
sheen
came
up
for
the
second
round
fresh
and
confident
his
head
was
clear
and
his
breath
no
longer
came
in
gasps
there
was
to
be
no
rallying
this
time
he
had
had
the
worst
of
the
first
round
and
meant
to
make
up
his
lost
points
peteiro
losing
no
time
dashed
in
sheen
met
him
with
a
left
in
the
face
and
gave
way
a
foot
again
peteiro
rushed
and
again
he
was
stopped
as
he
bored
in
for
the
third
time
sheen
slipped
him
the
ripton
man
paused
and
dropped
his
guard
for
a
moment
sheen
left
shot
out
once
more
and
found
its
mark
peteiro
swung
his
right
viciously
but
without
effect
another
swift
counter
added
one
more
point
to
sheen
score
sheen
nearly
chuckled
it
was
all
so
beautifully
simple
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
mix
it
up
in
the
first
round
if
he
only
kept
his
head
and
stuck
to
he
could
win
with
ease
the
man
could
box
he
was
nothing
more
than
a
slogger
here
he
came
as
usual
with
the
old
familiar
rush
out
went
his
left
but
it
missed
its
billet
peteiro
had
checked
his
rush
after
the
first
movement
and
now
he
came
in
with
both
hands
it
was
the
first
time
during
the
round
that
he
had
got
to
close
quarters
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
sheen
blows
were
as
frequent
but
his
were
harder
he
drove
at
the
body
right
and
left
and
once
again
the
call
of
time
extricated
sheen
from
an
awkward
position
as
far
as
points
were
concerned
he
had
had
the
best
of
the
round
but
he
was
very
sore
and
bruised
his
left
side
was
one
dull
ache
keep
away
from
him
sir
said
joe
bevan
you
were
ahead
on
that
round
keep
away
all
the
time
unless
he
gets
tired
but
if
you
see
me
signalling
then
go
in
all
you
can
and
have
a
fight
there
was
a
suspicion
of
weariness
about
the
look
of
the
ripton
champion
as
he
shook
hands
for
the
last
round
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
his
hurricane
fighting
in
the
opening
rounds
he
began
quietly
sparring
for
an
opening
sheen
led
with
his
left
peteiro
was
too
late
with
his
guard
sheen
tried
again
a
double
lead
his
opponent
guarded
the
first
blow
but
the
second
went
home
heavily
on
the
body
and
he
gave
way
a
step
then
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
sheen
saw
bevan
gesticulating
wildly
so
taking
his
life
in
his
hands
he
abandoned
his
waiting
game
dropped
his
guard
and
dashed
in
to
fight
peteiro
met
him
doggedly
for
a
few
moments
the
exchanges
were
even
then
suddenly
the
riptonian
blows
began
to
weaken
he
got
home
his
right
on
the
head
and
sheen
hardly
felt
it
and
in
a
flash
there
came
to
him
the
glorious
certainty
that
the
game
was
his
he
was
winning
winning
winning
that
enough
said
the
referee
the
ripton
man
was
leaning
against
the
ropes
utterly
spent
at
almost
the
same
spot
where
sheen
had
leaned
at
the
end
of
the
first
round
the
last
attack
had
finished
him
his
seconds
helped
him
to
his
corner
the
referee
waved
his
hand
sheen
wins
he
said
and
that
was
the
greatest
moment
of
his
life
xxiii
a
surprise
for
seymour
house
took
in
one
copy
of
the
daily
on
the
morning
after
the
aldershot
competition
linton
met
the
at
the
door
on
his
return
from
the
fives
courts
where
he
had
been
playing
a
couple
of
games
with
dunstable
he
relieved
him
of
the
house
copy
and
opened
it
to
see
how
the
wrykyn
pair
had
performed
in
the
gymnastics
he
did
not
expect
anything
great
having
a
rooted
contempt
for
both
experts
who
were
small
and
except
in
the
gymnasium
obscure
indeed
he
had
gone
so
far
on
the
previous
day
as
to
express
a
hope
that
biddle
the
more
despicable
of
the
two
would
fall
off
the
horizontal
bar
and
break
his
neck
still
he
might
as
well
see
where
they
had
come
out
after
all
with
all
their
faults
they
were
human
beings
like
himself
and
wrykinians
the
competition
was
reported
in
the
boxing
column
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
the
name
of
the
school
among
the
headlines
honours
said
the
headline
for
st
paul
harrow
and
wrykyn
hullo
said
linton
what
all
this
then
the
thing
came
on
him
with
nothing
to
soften
the
shock
he
had
folded
the
paper
and
the
last
words
on
the
half
uppermost
were
sheen
beat
linton
had
often
read
novels
in
which
some
important
document
swam
before
the
eyes
of
the
hero
or
the
heroine
but
he
had
never
understood
the
full
meaning
of
the
phrase
until
he
read
those
words
sheen
beat
peteiro
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
there
the
thing
was
it
was
impossible
for
the
to
have
been
hoaxed
no
the
incredible
outrageous
fact
must
be
faced
sheen
had
been
down
to
aldershot
and
won
a
silver
medal
sheen
sheen
who
had
who
was
well
who
in
a
word
was
sheen
linton
read
on
like
one
in
a
dream
the
fell
said
the
writer
to
a
newcomer
sheen
of
wrykyn
sheen
a
clever
youngster
with
a
strong
defence
and
a
beautiful
straight
left
doubtless
the
result
of
tuition
from
the
joe
bevan
who
was
in
his
corner
for
the
final
bout
none
of
his
opponents
gave
him
much
trouble
except
peteiro
of
ripton
whom
he
met
in
the
final
a
very
game
and
determined
fight
was
seen
when
these
two
met
but
sheen
skill
and
condition
discounted
the
rushing
tactics
of
his
adversary
and
in
the
last
minute
of
the
third
round
the
referee
stopped
the
encounter
game
and
determined
sheen
sympathy
was
freely
expressed
for
peteiro
who
has
thus
been
two
years
in
succession
he
however
met
a
better
man
and
paid
the
penalty
the
admirable
pluck
with
which
sheen
bore
his
punishment
and
gradually
wore
his
man
down
made
his
victory
the
most
popular
of
the
day
programme
details
of
the
fighting
described
sheen
as
cutting
out
the
work
popping
in
several
nice
lefts
swinging
his
right
for
the
point
and
executing
numerous
other
incredible
manoeuvres
you
caught
the
name
correctly
sheen
i
trouble
you
linton
stared
blankly
across
the
school
grounds
then
he
burst
into
a
sudden
yell
of
laughter
on
that
very
morning
the
senior
was
going
to
sheen
for
disgracing
the
house
the
resolution
had
been
passed
on
the
previous
afternoon
probably
just
as
he
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
most
popular
victory
of
the
day
programme
this
said
linton
is
rich
he
grubbed
a
little
hole
in
one
of
mr
seymour
and
laid
the
to
rest
in
it
the
news
would
be
about
the
school
at
nine
but
if
he
could
keep
it
from
the
senior
till
the
brief
interval
between
breakfast
and
school
all
would
be
well
and
he
would
have
the
pure
pleasure
of
seeing
that
backbone
of
the
house
make
a
complete
ass
of
itself
a
thought
struck
him
he
unearthed
the
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
strolled
into
the
senior
after
breakfast
any
one
seen
the
this
morning
he
inquired
no
one
had
seen
it
the
thing
has
come
said
some
one
good
said
linton
to
himself
at
this
point
stanning
strolled
into
the
room
i
a
witness
he
said
in
answer
to
linton
look
of
inquiry
we
doing
this
thing
in
style
i
depose
that
i
saw
the
prisoner
cutting
off
on
the
whatever
day
it
was
when
he
ought
to
have
been
saving
our
lives
from
the
fury
of
the
mob
had
somebody
better
bring
the
prisoner
into
the
dock
i
go
said
linton
promptly
i
may
be
a
little
time
but
do
get
worried
i
bring
him
all
right
he
went
upstairs
to
sheen
study
feeling
like
an
about
to
produce
a
new
play
which
is
sure
to
create
a
sensation
sheen
was
in
there
was
a
ridge
of
purple
under
his
left
eye
but
he
was
otherwise
intact
you
sheen
said
linton
for
an
instant
sheen
hesitated
he
had
rehearsed
this
kind
of
scene
in
his
mind
and
sometimes
he
saw
himself
playing
a
genial
forgiving
role
sometimes
being
cold
haughty
and
distant
and
repelling
friendly
advances
with
icy
disdain
if
anybody
but
linton
had
been
the
first
to
congratulate
him
he
might
have
decided
on
this
second
line
of
action
but
he
liked
linton
and
wanted
to
be
friendly
with
him
thanks
he
said
linton
sat
down
on
the
table
and
burst
into
a
torrent
of
speech
you
a
man
what
did
you
want
to
do
it
for
where
the
dickens
did
you
learn
to
box
and
why
on
earth
if
you
can
win
silver
medals
at
aldershot
did
you
box
for
the
house
and
smash
up
that
sidey
ass
stanning
i
say
look
here
i
suppose
we
have
been
making
idiots
of
ourselves
all
the
time
have
we
i
should
wonder
said
sheen
how
i
mean
you
did
what
i
mean
to
say
is
oh
hang
it
know
you
did
cut
off
when
we
had
that
row
in
the
town
did
you
yes
said
sheen
i
did
with
that
medal
in
his
pocket
it
cost
him
no
effort
to
make
the
confession
i
glad
of
that
i
mean
i
glad
we
have
been
such
fools
as
we
might
have
been
you
see
we
only
had
stanning
word
to
go
on
sheen
started
stanning
he
said
what
do
you
mean
he
was
the
chap
who
started
the
story
did
you
know
he
told
everybody
i
thought
it
was
drummond
said
sheen
blankly
you
remember
meeting
me
outside
his
study
the
day
after
i
thought
he
told
you
then
drummond
not
a
bit
of
it
he
swore
you
had
been
with
him
at
all
he
was
as
sick
as
anything
when
i
said
i
thought
i
seen
you
with
him
i
sheen
stopped
i
wish
i
known
he
concluded
then
after
a
pause
so
it
was
stanning
yes
conceited
beast
oh
i
say
um
i
see
it
all
now
joe
bevan
taught
you
to
box
yes
then
that
how
you
came
to
be
at
the
boar
that
day
he
the
bevan
who
runs
it
that
his
brother
he
got
a
gymnasium
up
at
the
top
i
used
to
go
there
every
day
but
i
say
great
scott
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
that
how
do
you
mean
why
spence
is
sure
to
ask
you
who
taught
you
to
box
he
must
know
you
did
learn
with
the
instructor
then
it
all
come
out
and
get
dropped
on
for
going
up
the
river
and
going
to
the
pub
perhaps
he
wo
ask
said
sheen
hope
not
oh
by
the
way
what
up
just
remembered
what
i
came
up
for
it

awful
rag

going
to
you

for
funking
they

about
aldershot
not
a
word
i
bagged
the
early
and

going
to
get
the
surprise
of
their
lifetime
i
said
i
come
up
and
fetch
you
i
sha

said
sheen
linton
looked
alarmed
oh
but
i
say
you
must
do
spoil
the
thing
ca
you
see
what
a
rag
it
be
i
not
going
to
sweat
downstairs
for
the
benefit
of
the
senior
i
say
said
linton
stanning
there
what
he
a
witness
said
linton
grinning
sheen
got
up
come
on
he
said
linton
came
on
down
in
the
senior
the
court
was
patiently
awaiting
the
prisoner
eager
anticipation
was
stamped
on
its
expressive
features
beastly
time
he
is
said
clayton
clayton
was
acting
as
president
we
shall
have
to
buck
up
said
stanning
hullo
here
he
is
at
last
come
in
linton
i
was
going
to
said
linton
but
thanks
all
the
same
come
along
sheen
shut
that
door
linton
said
stanning
from
his
seat
on
the
table
all
right
stanning
said
linton
anything
to
oblige
shall
i
bring
up
a
chair
for
you
to
rest
your
feet
on
forge
ahead
clayton
said
stanning
to
the
president
the
president
opened
the
in
unofficial
phraseology
look
here
sheen
he
said
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
has
got
a
bit
too
thick
you
must
talk
in
that
chatty
way
clayton
interrupted
linton
at
the
bar
the
right
expression
to
use
why
do
you
let
somebody
else
have
a
look
in
you
the
rottenest
president
of
a
i
ever
saw
do
rag
linton
said
clayton
with
an
austere
frown
this
is
serious
glad
you
told
me
said
linton
go
on
ca
you
sit
down
linton
said
stanning
i
was
only
waiting
for
leave
thanks
you
were
saying
something
clayton
it
sounded
pretty
average
rot
but
you
better
unburden
your
soul
the
president
resumed
we
want
to
know
if
you
anything
to
say
you
do
give
him
a
chance
said
linton
you
bag
the
conversation
so
about
disgracing
the
house
by
getting
the
gotford
you
know
sheen
explained
linton
clayton
thinks
that
work
a
bad
habit
and
ought
to
be
discouraged
clayton
glared
and
looked
at
stanning
he
was
not
equal
to
the
task
of
tackling
linton
himself
stanning
interposed
do
rot
linton
we
have
much
time
as
it
is
sorry
said
linton
you
let
the
house
down
awfully
said
clayton
yes
said
sheen
linton
took
the
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
smoothed
it
out
seen
the
he
asked
casually
his
neighbour
grabbed
at
it
i
thought
it
had
come
he
said
good
account
of
aldershot
said
linton
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
as
two
or
three
of
the
senior
collected
round
the
hullo
we
won
the
rot
let
have
a
look
this
tremendous
announcement
quite
eclipsed
the
as
an
object
of
popular
interest
the
senior
surged
round
the
holder
of
the
paper
give
us
a
chance
he
protested
we
ca
have
where
is
it
biddle
and
smith
are
simply
hopeless
how
the
dickens
can
they
have
got
the
shield
what
a
goat
you
are
said
a
voice
reproachfully
to
the
possessor
of
the
paper
look
at
this
it
says
cheltenham
got
it
and
here
we
are
seventeenth
fat
lot
of
shield
we
won
then
what
the
deuce
does
this
mean
for
st
paul
harrow
and
wrykyn
perhaps
it
refers
to
the
boxing
suggested
linton
but
we
did
send
any
one
up
look
here
harrow
won
the
heavies
st
paul
got
the
middles
great
scott
said
the
senior
there
was
a
blank
silence
linton
whistled
softly
to
himself
the
gaze
of
the
senior
was
concentrated
on
that
ridge
of
purple
beneath
sheen
left
eye
clayton
was
the
first
to
speak
for
some
time
he
had
been
waiting
for
sufficient
silence
to
enable
him
to
proceed
with
his
presidential
duties
he
addressed
himself
to
sheen
look
here
sheen
he
said
we
want
to
know
what
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
you
go
disgracing
the
house
the
stunned
senior
were
roused
to
speech
oh
chuck
it
clayton
do
be
a
fool
clayton
silly
idiot
clayton
looked
round
in
pained
surprise
at
this
sudden
withdrawal
of
popular
support
you
better
be
polite
to
sheen
said
linton
he
won
the
at
aldershot
yesterday
the
silence
once
more
became
strained
well
said
sheen
were
you
going
to
me
or
something
clayton
were
you
saying
something
clayton
started
he
had
not
yet
grasped
the
situation
entirely
but
he
realised
dimly
that
by
some
miracle
sheen
had
turned
in
an
instant
into
a
most
formidable
person
er
no
he
said
no
nothing
the
thing
seems
to
have
fallen
through
sheen
said
linton
great
pity
started
so
well
too
clayton
always
makes
a
mess
of
things
then
i
just
like
to
say
one
thing
said
sheen
respectful
attention
from
the
senior
i
only
want
to
know
why
you
ca
manage
things
of
this
sort
by
yourselves
without
dragging
in
men
from
other
houses
especially
men
like
stanning
said
linton
the
same
thing
occurred
to
me
it
lucky
drummond
was
here
remember
the
last
time
you
chaps
the
chaps
did
stanning
became
an
object
of
critical
interest
after
all
who
stanning
what
right
had
he
to
come
and
sit
on
tables
in
seymour
and
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
the
house
the
allusion
to
last
time
was
lost
upon
sheen
but
he
saw
that
it
had
not
improved
stanning
position
with
the
spectators
he
opened
the
door
good
bye
stanning
he
said
if
i
had
hurt
my
wrist
stanning
began
hurt
your
wrist
said
sheen
you
got
a
bad
attack
of
peteiro
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
you
you
think
that
every
one
a
funk
like
yourself
said
stanning
pity
they
are
said
linton
we
should
do
rather
well
down
at
aldershot
and
he
was
such
a
terror
after
all
sheen
was
he
you
beat
him
in
two
and
a
half
rounds
did
you
think
what
stanning
might
have
done
if
only
he
had
sprained
his
poor
wrist
just
in
time
look
here
linton
some
are
born
with
sprained
wrists
continued
the
speaker
some
achieve
sprained
wrists
like
stanning
stanning
took
a
step
towards
him
do
forget
you
a
sprained
wrist
said
linton
come
on
stanning
said
sheen
who
was
still
holding
the
door
open
you
be
much
more
comfortable
in
your
own
house
i
show
you
out
i
suppose
said
stanning
in
the
passage
you
think
you
scored
off
me
that
said
sheen
pleasantly
is
rather
the
idea
good
bye
xxiv
bruce
explains
mr
spence
was
a
master
with
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
and
a
highly
developed
sense
of
duty
it
was
the
combination
of
these
two
qualities
which
made
it
so
difficult
for
him
to
determine
on
a
suitable
course
of
action
in
relation
to
sheen
exploits
as
a
private
individual
he
had
nothing
but
admiration
for
the
sporting
way
in
which
sheen
had
fought
his
fight
he
felt
that
he
himself
in
similar
circumstances
would
have
broken
any
number
of
school
rules
but
as
a
master
it
was
his
duty
he
considered
to
report
him
if
a
master
ignored
a
breach
of
rules
in
one
case
with
which
he
happened
to
sympathise
he
would
in
common
fairness
be
compelled
to
overlook
a
similar
breach
of
rules
in
other
cases
even
if
he
did
not
sympathise
with
them
in
which
event
he
would
be
of
small
use
as
a
master
on
the
other
hand
sheen
case
was
so
exceptional
that
he
might
very
well
compromise
to
a
certain
extent
between
the
claims
of
sympathy
and
those
of
duty
if
he
were
to
go
to
the
headmaster
and
state
baldly
that
sheen
had
been
in
the
habit
for
the
last
of
visiting
an
the
headmaster
would
get
an
entirely
wrong
idea
of
the
matter
and
suspect
all
sorts
of
things
which
had
no
existence
in
fact
when
a
boy
is
accused
of
frequenting
a
the
mind
leaps
naturally
to
stale
fumes
and
the
drunken
stagger
so
mr
spence
decided
on
a
compromise
he
sent
for
sheen
and
having
congratulated
him
warmly
on
his
victory
in
the
proceeded
as
follows
you
have
given
me
to
understand
sheen
that
you
were
taught
boxing
by
bevan
yes
sir
at
the
boar
yes
sir
this
puts
me
in
a
rather
difficult
position
sheen
much
as
i
dislike
doing
it
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
report
this
matter
to
the
headmaster
sheen
said
he
supposed
so
he
saw
mr
spence
point
but
i
shall
not
mention
the
boar
if
i
did
the
headmaster
might
get
quite
the
wrong
impression
he
would
not
understand
all
the
circumstances
so
i
shall
simply
mention
that
you
broke
bounds
by
going
up
the
river
i
shall
tell
him
the
whole
story
you
understand
and
it
quite
possible
that
you
will
hear
no
more
of
the
affair
i
sure
i
hope
so
but
you
understand
my
position
yes
sir
that
all
then
sheen
oh
by
the
way
you
would
care
for
a
game
of
fives
before
breakfast
tomorrow
i
suppose
i
should
like
it
sir
not
too
stiff
no
sir
very
well
then
i
be
there
by
a
seven
jack
bruce
was
waiting
to
see
the
headmaster
in
his
study
at
the
end
of
afternoon
school
well
bruce
said
the
headmaster
coming
into
the
room
and
laying
down
some
books
on
the
table
do
you
want
to
speak
to
me
will
you
give
your
father
my
congratulations
on
his
victory
i
shall
be
writing
to
him
tonight
i
see
from
the
paper
that
the
polling
was
very
even
apparently
one
or
two
voters
arrived
at
the
last
moment
and
turned
the
scale
yes
sir
it
is
a
most
gratifying
result
i
am
sure
that
apart
from
our
political
views
we
should
all
have
been
disappointed
if
your
father
had
not
won
please
congratulate
him
sincerely
yes
sir
well
bruce
and
what
was
it
that
you
wished
to
see
me
about
bruce
was
about
to
reply
when
the
door
opened
and
mr
spence
came
in
one
moment
bruce
said
the
headmaster
yes
spence
mr
spence
made
his
report
clearly
and
concisely
bruce
listened
with
interest
he
thought
it
hardly
playing
the
game
for
the
gymnasium
master
to
hand
sheen
over
to
be
executed
at
the
very
moment
when
the
school
was
shaking
hands
with
itself
over
the
one
decent
thing
that
had
been
done
for
it
in
the
course
of
the
athletic
year
but
he
told
himself
philosophically
that
he
supposed
masters
had
to
do
these
things
then
he
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
mr
spence
was
putting
the
matter
in
a
very
favourable
light
for
the
accused
he
was
avoiding
with
some
care
any
mention
of
the
blue
boar
when
he
had
occasion
to
refer
to
the
scene
of
sheen
training
he
mentioned
it
vaguely
as
a
house
this
man
bevan
who
is
an
excellent
fellow
and
a
personal
friend
of
my
own
has
a
house
some
way
up
the
river
of
course
a
a
house
up
the
river
said
the
headmaster
meditatively
it
seemed
that
that
was
all
that
was
wrong
the
prosecution
centred
round
that
point
and
no
other
jack
bruce
as
he
listened
saw
his
way
of
coping
with
the
situation
thank
you
spence
said
the
headmaster
at
the
conclusion
of
the
narrative
i
quite
understand
that
sheen
conduct
was
very
excusable
but
i
distinctly
said
i
placed
the
upper
river
out
of
bounds
well
i
will
see
sheen
and
speak
to
him
i
will
speak
to
him
mr
spence
left
the
room
please
sir
said
jack
bruce
ah
bruce
i
am
afraid
i
have
kept
you
some
little
time
yes
i
could
help
hearing
what
mr
spence
was
saying
to
you
about
sheen
sir
i
do
think
he
knows
quite
what
really
happened
you
mean
sheen
went
there
by
road
i
used
to
take
him
in
my
motor
your
what
did
you
say
bruce
my
sir
that
to
say
my
father
we
used
to
go
together
every
day
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
am
glad
then
i
need
say
nothing
to
sheen
after
all
i
am
glad
but
er
bruce
proceeded
the
headmaster
after
a
pause
yes
sir
do
you
are
you
in
the
habit
of
driving
a
frequently
every
day
sir
you
see
i
am
going
to
take
up
motors
when
i
leave
school
so
it
all
education
the
headmaster
was
silent
to
him
the
word
education
meant
classics
there
was
a
modern
side
at
wrykyn
and
an
engineering
side
and
also
a
science
side
but
in
his
heart
he
recognised
but
one
education
the
classics
nothing
that
he
had
heard
nothing
that
he
had
read
in
the
papers
and
the
monthly
reviews
had
brought
home
to
him
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
the
fact
that
things
were
not
as
they
used
to
be
so
clearly
as
this
one
remark
of
jack
bruce
for
here
was
bruce
admitting
that
in
his
spare
time
he
drove
motors
and
stranger
still
that
he
did
it
not
as
a
wild
frolic
but
seriously
with
a
view
to
his
future
career
the
old
order
changeth
thought
the
headmaster
a
little
sadly
then
he
brought
himself
back
from
his
mental
plunge
into
the
future
well
well
bruce
he
said
we
need
not
discuss
the
merits
and
demerits
of
driving
need
we
what
did
you
wish
to
see
me
about
i
came
to
ask
if
i
might
get
off
morning

voters
who
got
to
the
poll
just
in
time
and
settled

the
policeman

a
radical
and
voted

mr
pedder

sworn

i
was
exceeding
the
the
headmaster
pressed
a
hand
to
his
forehead
and
his
mind
swam
into
the
future
well
bruce
he
said
at
length
in
the
voice
of
one
whom
nothing
can
surprise
now
he
says

hour

stolid
wariness
of
the
boy
