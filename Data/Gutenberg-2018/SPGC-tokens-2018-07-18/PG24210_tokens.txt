harriet
martineau
was
the
daughter
of
a
norwich
textile
manufacturer
of
huguenot
descent
hence
the
name
and
trade
in
the
bank
in
which
she
her
mother
and
her
sisters
had
placed
their
money
failed
and
she
was
forced
to
earn
a
living
through
writing
at
which
she
was
very
talented
particularly
on
political
issues
such
as
the
poverty
facing
a
family
on
the
death
of
the
in
after
her
travels
in
america
she
wrote
two
long
novels
of
which
deerbrook
was
one
and
a
book
about
toussaint
the
other
this
book
therefore
gives
great
insight
into
the
lives
of
upper
middle
class
families
of
the
mid
nineteenth
century
no
one
in
families
these
days
talks
to
the
rest
of
the
family
in
the
polite
perhaps
terms
used
in
this
book
for
this
reason
though
it
was
not
meant
to
be
taken
as
such
this
book
is
a
true
social
document

by
harriet
martineau
chapter
one
an
event
every
person
who
travels
in
a
rich
country
region
knows
what
it
is
to
see
a
neat
white
house
planted
in
a
pretty
situation
in
a
shrubbery
or
commanding
a
sunny
common
or
nestling
between
two
hills
and
to
say
to
himself
as
the
carriage
sweeps
past
its
gate
i
should
like
to
live
there
i
could
be
very
happy
in
that
pretty
place
transient
visions
pass
before
his
mind
eye
of
dewy
summer
mornings
when
the
shadows
are
long
on
the
grass
and
of
bright
autumn
afternoons
when
it
would
be
luxury
to
saunter
in
the
neighbouring
lanes
and
of
frosty
winter
days
when
the
sun
shines
in
over
the
laurustinus
at
the
window
while
the
fire
burns
with
a
different
light
from
that
which
it
gives
in
the
dull
parlours
of
a
city
mr
grey
house
had
probably
been
the
object
of
this
kind
of
speculation
to
one
or
more
persons
three
times
a
week
ever
since
the
had
begun
to
pass
through
deerbrook
deerbrook
was
a
rather
pretty
village
dignified
as
it
was
with
the
woods
of
a
fine
park
which
formed
the
background
to
its
best
points
of
view
of
this
pretty
village
mr
grey
was
the
prettiest
house
standing
in
a
field
round
which
the
road
swept
there
were
trees
enough
about
it
to
shade
without
darkening
it
and
the
garden
and
shrubbery
behind
were
evidently
of
no
contemptible
extent
the
timber
and
coal
yards
and
granaries
which
stretched
down
to
the
river
side
were
hidden
by
a
nice
management
of
the
garden
walls
and
training
of
the
shrubbery
in
the
of
this
tempting
white
house
sat
mrs
grey
and
her
eldest
daughter
one
spring
evening
it
was
rather
an
unusual
thing
for
them
to
be
in
the
sophia
read
history
and
practised
her
music
every
morning
in
the
little
blue
parlour
which
looked
towards
the
road
and
her
mother
sat
in
the
which
had
the
same
aspect
the
advantage
of
these
rooms
was
that
they
commanded
the
house
of
mr
rowland
mr
grey
partner
in
the
corn
coal
and
timber
business
and
also
the
dwelling
of
mrs
enderby
mrs
rowland
mother
who
lived
just
opposite
the
rowlands
the
looked
merely
into
the
garden
the
only
houses
seen
from
it
were
the
greenhouse
and
the
summerhouse
the
latter
of
which
now
served
the
purpose
of
a
schoolroom
for
the
children
of
both
families
and
stood
on
the
of
the
gardens
of
the
two
gentlemen
of
the
firm
the
was
so
dull
that
it
was
kept
for
company
that
is
it
was
used
about
three
times
when
the
pictures
were
unveiled
the
green
baize
removed
and
the
which
opened
upon
the
lawn
thrown
wide
to
afford
to
the
rare
guests
of
the
family
a
welcome
from
birds
and
flowers
the
were
open
now
and
on
one
side
sat
mrs
grey
working
a
rug
and
on
the
other
sophia
working
a
collar
the
ladies
were
evidently
in
a
state
of
expectation
a
state
exceedingly
trying
to
people
who
living
at
ease
in
the
country
have
rarely
anything
to
expect
beyond
the
days
of
the
week
the
newspaper
and
their
dinners
mrs
grey
gave
her
needle
a
rest
every
few
minutes
to
listen
and
rang
the
bell
three
times
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
make
inquiries
of
her
maid
about
the
arrangements
of
the
best
bedroom
sophia
could
not
attend
to
her
work
and
presently
gave
information
that
fanny
and
mary
were
in
the
orchard
she
was
desired
to
call
them
and
presently
fanny
and
mary
appeared
at
the
window
twins
of
ten
years
old
and
very
pretty
little
girls
my
dears
said
mrs
grey
has
miss
young
done
with
you
for
oh
yes
mamma
it
is
just
six
we
have
been
out
of
school
this
hour
almost
then
come
in
and
make
yourselves
neat
and
sit
down
with
us
i
should
not
wonder
if
the
miss
ibbotsons
should
be
here
now
before
you
are
ready
but
where
is
sydney
oh
he
is
making
a
pond
in
his
garden
there
he
dug
it
before
school
this
morning
and
he
is
filling
it
now
yes
said
the
other
and
i
do
know
when
he
will
have
done
for
as
fast
as
he
fills
it
it
empties
again
and
he
says
he
can
not
think
how
people
keep
their
ponds
filled
he
must
have
done
now
however
said
his
mother
i
suppose
he
is
tearing
his
clothes
to
pieces
with
drawing
the
and
wetting
himself
to
the
skin
besides
and
spoiling
his
garden
said
fanny
he
has
dug
up
all
his
hepaticas
and
two
to
make
his
pond
go
to
him
my
dears
and
tell
him
to
come
in
directly
and
dress
himself
for
tea
tell
him
i
insist
upon
it
do
not
run
walk
quietly
you
will
heat
yourselves
and
i
do
not
like
mrs
rowland
to
see
you
running
mary
informed
her
brother
that
he
was
to
leave
his
pond
and
come
in
and
fanny
added
that
mamma
insisted
upon
it
they
had
time
to
do
this
to
walk
quietly
to
have
their
hair
made
quite
smooth
and
to
sit
down
with
their
two
dolls
on
each
side
the
common
cradle
in
a
corner
of
the
before
the
miss
ibbotsons
arrived
the
miss
ibbotsons
were
daughters
of
a
distant
relation
of
mr
grey
their
mother
had
been
dead
many
years
they
had
now
just
lost
their
father
and
were
left
without
any
nearer
relation
than
mr
grey
he
had
invited
them
to
visit
his
family
while
their
father
affairs
were
in
course
of
arrangement
and
till
it
could
be
discovered
what
their
means
of
living
were
likely
to
be
they
had
passed
their
lives
in
birmingham
and
had
every
inclination
to
return
to
it
when
their
visit
to
their
deerbrook
relations
should
have
been
paid
their
old
schoolfellows
and
friends
all
lived
there
and
they
thought
it
would
be
easier
and
pleasanter
to
make
the
smallest
income
supply
their
wants
in
their
native
town
than
to
remove
to
any
place
where
it
might
go
further
they
had
taken
leave
of
their
friends
as
for
a
very
short
time
and
when
they
entered
deerbrook
looked
around
them
as
upon
a
place
in
which
they
were
to
pass
a
summer
all
deerbrook
had
been
informed
of
their
expected
arrival
as
it
always
was
of
everything
which
concerned
the
greys
the
little
rowlands
were
walking
with
their
mother
when
the
chaise
came
up
the
street
but
being
particularly
desired
not
to
look
at
it
they
were
not
much
benefited
by
the
event
their
grandmamma
mrs
enderby
was
not
at
the
moment
under
the
same
restriction
and
her
high
cap
might
be
seen
above
the
green
blind
of
her
parlour
as
the
chaise
turned
into
mr
grey
gate
the
stationer
the
parish
clerk
and
the
milliner
and
her
assistant
had
obtained
a
passing
view
of
sundry
boxes
the
face
of
an
elderly
woman
and
the
outline
of
two
black
bonnets
all
that
they
could
boast
of
to
repay
them
for
the
vigilance
of
a
whole
afternoon
sophia
grey
might
be
pardoned
for
some
anxiety
about
the
reception
of
the
young
ladies
she
was
four
years
younger
than
the
younger
of
them
and
hester
the
elder
was
a
venerable
age
to
a
girl
of
sixteen
sophia
began
to
think
she
had
never
been
really
afraid
of
anything
before
though
she
remembered
having
cried
bitterly
when
first
left
alone
with
her
governess
and
though
she
had
always
been
remarkable
for
clinging
to
her
mother
side
on
all
social
occasions
in
the
approaching
trial
her
mother
could
give
her
little
assistance
these
cousins
would
be
always
with
her
how
she
should
read
history
or
practise
music
with
them
in
the
room
she
could
not
imagine
nor
what
she
should
find
to
say
to
them
all
day
long
if
poor
elizabeth
had
but
lived
what
a
comfort
she
would
have
been
now
the
elder
one
would
have
taken
all
the
responsibility
and
she
heaved
a
sigh
once
more
as
she
thought
to
the
memory
of
poor
elizabeth
mr
grey
was
at
a
market
some
miles
off
and
sydney
was
sent
by
his
mother
into
the
hall
to
assist
in
the
work
of
alighting
and
causing
the
luggage
to
alight
as
any
other
boy
of
thirteen
would
have
done
he
slunk
behind
the
hall
door
without
venturing
to
speak
to
the
strangers
and
left
the
business
to
the
guests
and
the
maids
mrs
grey
and
sophia
awaited
them
in
the
and
were
ready
with
information
about
how
uneasy
they
had
all
been
about
the
rain
in
the
morning
till
they
remembered
that
it
would
lay
the
dust
and
so
make
the
journey
pleasanter
the
twins
shouldered
their
dolls
and
looked
on
from
their
stools
while
sydney
stole
in
and
for
want
of
some
better
way
of
covering
his
awkwardness
began
rocking
the
cradle
with
his
foot
till
he
tilted
it
over
sophia
found
the
first
not
at
all
difficult
to
surmount
she
and
margaret
ibbotson
informed
each
other
of
the
precise
number
of
miles
between
deerbrook
and
birmingham
she
ascertained
fully
to
her
satisfaction
that
her
guests
had
dined
she
assisted
them
in
the
observation
that
the
grass
of
the
lawn
looked
very
green
after
the
streets
of
birmingham
and
she
had
to
tell
them
that
her
father
was
obliged
to
attend
the
market
some
miles
off
and
would
not
be
home
for
an
hour
or
two
then
the
time
came
when
bonnets
were
to
be
taken
off
and
she
could
offer
to
show
the
way
to
the
there
she
took
hester
and
margaret
to
the
window
and
explained
to
them
what
they
saw
thence
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
talk
she
poured
out
what
was
most
familiar
to
her
mind
experiencing
a
sudden
relief
from
all
the
unwonted
shyness
which
had
tormented
her
that
is
mr
rowland
house
papa
partner
you
know
is
it
an
ugly
place
with
that
ridiculous
porch
to
it
but
mrs
rowland
can
never
be
satisfied
without
altering
her
house
once
a
year
she
has
made
mr
rowland
spend
more
money
upon
that
place
than
would
have
built
a
new
one
of
twice
the
that
house
opposite
is
mrs
enderby
mrs
rowland
mother
so
near
as
she
lives
to
the
rowlands
it
is
shocking
how
they
neglect
her
there
could
be
no
difficulty
in
being
properly
attentive
to
her
so
near
as
she
is
could
there
but
when
she
is
ill
we
are
obliged
to
go
and
see
her
sometimes
when
it
is
very
inconvenient
because
mrs
rowland
has
never
been
near
her
all
day
is
not
it
shocking
i
rather
wonder
she
should
complain
of
her
family
observed
margaret
oh
she
is
not
remarkable
for
keeping
her
feelings
to
herself
poor
soul
but
really
it
is
wonderful
how
little
she
says
about
it
except
when
her
heart
is
quite
full
just
to
us
she
tries
to
excuse
mrs
rowland
all
she
can
and
she
makes
out
that
mrs
rowland
is
such
an
excellent
mother
and
so
busy
with
her
children
and
all
that
but
you
know
that
is
no
excuse
for
not
taking
care
of
her
own
mother
those
are
the
verdon
woods
are
they
not
said
hester
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
survey
the
whole
of
the
sunny
prospect
i
suppose
you
spend
half
your
days
in
those
woods
in
summer
no
mamma
goes
out
very
little
and
i
seldom
walk
beyond
the
garden
but
now
you
are
come
we
shall
go
everywhere
ours
is
considered
a
very
pretty
village
the
sisters
thought
it
so
beautiful
that
they
gazed
as
if
they
feared
it
would
melt
away
if
they
withdrew
their
eyes
the
one
discovered
the
bridge
lying
in
shadow
the
other
the
pointed
roof
of
the
building
which
surmounted
the
spring
in
the
park
woods
sophia
was
well
pleased
at
their
pleasure
and
their
questions
and
her
descriptions
went
on
improving
in
rapidity
till
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
cut
short
the
catechism
it
was
morris
the
miss
ibbotsons
maid
and
her
appearance
gave
sophia
a
hint
to
leave
her
guests
to
refresh
themselves
she
glanced
over
the
room
to
see
that
nothing
was
wanting
pointed
out
the
bell
intimated
that
the
washstands
were
mahogany
which
showed
every
splash
and
explained
that
the
green
blinds
were
meant
to
be
always
down
when
the
sun
shone
in
lest
it
should
fade
the
carpet
she
then
withdrew
telling
the
young
ladies
that
they
would
find
tea
ready
when
they
came
down
how
very
handsome
hester
is
was
the
exclamation
of
both
mother
and
daughter
when
sophia
had
shut
the
door
behind
her
i
wonder
said
mrs
grey
that
nobody
ever
told
us
how
handsome
we
should
find
hester
i
should
like
to
see
what
fault
mrs
rowland
can
find
in
her
face
it
is
rather
odd
that
one
sister
should
have
all
the
beauty
said
sophia
i
do
not
see
anything
striking
in
margaret
mrs
rowland
will
say
she
is
plain
but
in
my
opinion
margaret
is
better
looking
than
any
of
the
rowlands
are
ever
likely
to
be
margaret
would
not
be
thought
plain
away
from
her
i
hope
they
are
not
fine
ladies
i
am
rather
surprised
at
their
bringing
a
maid
she
looks
a
very
respectable
person
but
i
did
not
suppose
they
would
keep
a
maid
till
they
knew
better
what
to
look
forward
to
i
do
not
know
what
mr
grey
will
think
of
it
when
hester
and
margaret
came
down
mrs
grey
was
ready
with
an
account
of
the
society
of
the
place
we
are
as
well
off
for
society
said
she
as
most
places
of
the
size
if
you
were
to
ask
the
bookseller
at
blickley
who
supplies
our
club
he
would
tell
you
that
we
are
rather
intellectual
people
and
i
hope
you
will
see
when
our
friends
have
called
on
you
that
though
we
seem
to
be
living
out
of
the
world
we
are
not
without
our
pleasures
i
think
sophia
the
levitts
will
certainly
call
oh
yes
mamma
i
have
no
doubt
dr
levitt
is
our
rector
observed
mrs
grey
to
her
guests
we
are
dissenters
as
you
know
and
our
neighbour
mrs
rowland
is
very
much
scandalised
at
it
if
mr
rowland
would
have
allowed
it
she
would
have
made
a
difficulty
on
that
ground
about
having
her
children
educated
with
mine
but
the
levitts
conduct
might
teach
her
better
they
make
no
difference
on
account
of
our
being
dissenters
they
always
call
on
our
friends
the
first
day
after
they
arrive
or
the
second
at
furthest
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
see
the
levitts
and
mrs
enderby
i
am
sure
said
sophia
if
she
is
at
all
able
to
stir
out
oh
yes
mrs
enderby
knows
what
is
right
if
her
daughter
does
not
if
she
does
not
call
i
shall
think
that
mrs
rowland
prevented
her
she
can
keep
her
mother
within
doors
as
we
know
when
it
suits
her
purposes
but
mr
philip
is
here
mamma
and
mrs
enderby
can
do
as
she
likes
when
she
has
her
son
with
i
assure
you
he
is
here
mamma
i
saw
the
cobbler
boy
carry
home
a
pair
of
boots
there
this
morning
sydney
had
better
evidence
still
to
produce
mr
enderby
had
been
talking
with
him
about
fishing
this
afternoon
he
said
he
had
come
down
for
a
fortnight
fishing
fanny
also
declared
that
matilda
rowland
had
told
miss
young
that
uncle
philip
was
coming
to
see
the
new
schoolroom
mrs
grey
was
always
glad
on
poor
mrs
enderby
account
when
she
had
her
son
with
her
but
otherwise
she
owned
she
did
not
care
for
his
coming
he
was
too
like
his
sister
to
please
her
he
is
very
high
to
be
sure
observed
sophia
and
really
there
is
no
occasion
for
that
with
us
resumed
mrs
grey
we
should
never
think
of
mixing
him
up
with
his
sister
proceedings
if
he
did
not
do
it
himself
no
one
would
suppose
him
answerable
for
her
rudeness
at
least
i
am
sure
such
a
thing
would
never
enter
my
head
but
he
forces
it
upon
one
mind
by
carrying
himself
so
high
i
do
think
he
can
help
being
so
tall
observed
sydney
but
he
buttons
up
and
makes
the
most
of
it
replied
sophia
he
stalks
in
like
a
polish
count
the
sisters
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
proof
that
the
incursions
of
the
poles
into
this
place
were
confined
to
the
book
club
they
happened
to
be
well
acquainted
with
a
polish
count
who
was
short
of
stature
and
did
not
stalk
they
were
spared
all
necessity
of
exerting
themselves
in
conversation
for
it
went
on
very
well
without
the
aid
of
more
than
a
word
or
two
from
them
do
you
think
mamma
the
andersons
will
come
asked
sophia
not
before
sunday
my
dear
the
andersons
live
three
miles
off
she
explained
and
are
much
confined
by
their
school
they
may
possibly
call
on
saturday
afternoon
as
saturday
is
a
but
sunday
after
church
is
a
more
likely
we
do
not
much
approve
of
sunday
visits
and
i
dare
say
you
feel
the
same
but
this
is
a
particular
case
people
living
three
miles
off
you
know
and
keeping
a
school
and
being
dissenters
we
do
not
like
to
appear
illiberal
to
those
who
are
not
of
our
own
way
of
thinking
so
the
andersons
sometimes
come
in
after
church
and
i
am
sure
you
will
accept
their
call
just
as
if
it
was
made
in
any
other
way
hester
and
margaret
could
only
say
that
they
should
be
happy
to
see
mr
and
mrs
anderson
in
any
mode
which
was
most
convenient
to
themselves
a
laugh
went
through
the
family
and
a
general
exclamation
of
mr
and
mrs
anderson
the
andersons
happened
to
be
two
maiden
sisters
who
kept
a
young
ladies
school
it
was
some
time
before
mrs
grey
herself
could
so
far
command
her
countenance
as
to
frown
with
becoming
severity
at
fanny
who
continued
to
giggle
for
some
time
with
intervals
of
convulsive
stillness
at
the
idea
that
the
andersons
could
mean
mr
and
mrs
anderson
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
mr
grey
entered
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
head
of
each
twin
observed
that
they
seemed
very
merry
and
asked
whether
his
cousins
had
been
kind
enough
to
make
them
laugh
already
to
these
cousins
he
offered
a
brief
and
hearty
welcome
remarking
that
he
supposed
they
had
been
told
what
had
prevented
his
being
on
the
spot
on
their
arrival
and
that
he
need
not
trouble
them
with
the
story
over
again
sydney
had
slipped
out
as
his
father
entered
for
the
chance
of
riding
his
horse
to
the
stable
a
ride
of
any
length
being
in
his
opinion
better
than
none
when
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
he
tried
to
whisper
to
sophia
over
the
back
of
her
chair
but
could
not
for
laughing
after
repeated
attempts
sophia
pushed
him
away
come
my
boy
out
with
it
said
his
father
what
you
can
tell
your
sister
you
can
tell
us
what
is
the
joke
sydney
looked
as
if
he
had
rather
not
explain
before
the
strangers
but
he
never
dared
to
trifle
with
his
father
he
had
just
heard
from
little
george
rowland
that
mrs
rowland
had
said
at
home
that
the
young
ladies
at
mr
grey
who
had
been
made
so
much
fuss
about
were
not
ladies
after
all
she
had
seen
the
face
of
one
as
they
passed
her
in
the
chaise
and
she
was
sure
the
person
could
not
be
less
than
fifty
she
saw
morris
no
doubt
said
hester
amidst
the
general
laugh
i
hope
she
will
come
and
see
some
people
who
are
very
little
like
fifty
said
mrs
grey
she
will
be
surprised
i
think
she
added
looking
at
hester
with
a
very
meaning
manner
of
admiration
i
really
hope
for
her
own
sake
she
will
come
though
you
need
not
mind
if
she
does
not
you
will
have
no
great
loss
mr
grey
i
suppose
you
think
she
will
call
no
doubt
my
dear
mrs
rowland
never
omits
calling
on
our
friends
and
why
should
she
now
and
mr
grey
applied
himself
to
conversation
with
his
cousins
while
the
rest
of
the
family
enjoyed
further
merriment
about
mrs
rowland
having
mistaken
morris
for
one
of
the
miss
ibbotsons
mr
grey
showed
a
sympathy
with
the
sisters
which
made
them
more
at
home
than
they
had
felt
since
they
entered
the
house
he
knew
some
of
their
birmingham
friends
and
could
speak
of
the
institutions
and
interests
of
the
town
for
a
whole
hour
he
engaged
them
in
brisk
conversation
without
having
once
alluded
to
their
private
affairs
or
his
own
or
said
one
word
about
deerbrook
society
at
the
end
of
that
time
just
as
mary
and
fanny
had
received
orders
to
go
to
bed
and
were
putting
their
dolls
into
the
cradle
in
preparation
the
scrambling
of
a
horse
feet
was
heard
on
the
gravel
before
the
front
door
and
the
rang
who
can
be
coming
at
this
time
of
night
said
mrs
grey
it
is
hope
i
have
no
doubt
replied
her
husband
as
i
passed
his
door
i
asked
him
to
go
out
to
old
mr
smithson
who
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
worse
than
better
and
to
let
me
know
whether
anything
can
be
done
for
the
old
gentleman
hope
has
come
to
report
of
him
no
doubt
oh
mamma
do
send
us
to
bed
if
it
is
mr
hope
cried
the
little
girls
let
us
sit
up
a
little
longer
if
it
is
mr
hope
mr
hope
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
children
with
us
all
observed
mrs
grey
to
the
sisters
we
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
him
as
our
medical
man
as
indeed
every
one
has
who
employs
him
mr
grey
brought
him
here
and
we
consider
him
the
greatest
acquisition
our
society
ever
had
the
sisters
could
not
be
surprised
at
this
when
they
saw
mr
hope
the
only
wonder
was
that
in
the
description
of
the
intellectual
society
of
deerbrook
mr
hope
had
not
been
mentioned
first
he
was
not
handsome
but
there
was
a
gaiety
of
countenance
and
manner
in
him
under
which
the
very
lamp
seemed
to
burn
brighter
he
came
as
mr
grey
had
explained
on
business
and
not
having
been
aware
of
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
would
have
retreated
when
his
errand
was
done
but
as
opposition
was
made
to
this
by
both
parents
and
children
he
sat
down
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
be
taken
into
consultation
about
how
the
miss
ibbotsons
were
to
be
conducted
through
the
process
of
seeing
the
sights
of
deerbrook
with
all
sincerity
the
sisters
declared
that
the
woods
of
the
park
would
fully
satisfy
them
that
they
had
been
accustomed
to
a
life
so
quiet
that
excursions
were
not
at
all
necessary
to
their
enjoyment
mr
grey
was
determined
that
they
should
visit
every
place
worth
seeing
in
the
neighbourhood
while
it
was
in
its
summer
beauty
mr
hope
was
exactly
the
right
person
to
consult
as
there
was
no
nook
no
hamlet
to
which
his
tastes
or
his
profession
had
not
led
him
sophia
put
paper
before
him
on
which
he
was
to
note
distances
according
to
his
and
mr
grey
computations
now
it
was
one
peculiarity
of
mr
hope
that
he
could
never
see
a
piece
of
paper
before
him
without
drawing
upon
it
sophia
and
any
sheet
of
which
might
ever
have
come
in
his
way
bore
tokens
of
this
and
now
his
fingers
were
as
busy
as
usual
while
he
was
talking
and
computing
and
arranging
when
as
he
said
enough
had
been
planned
to
occupy
a
month
he
threw
down
his
pencil
and
took
leave
till
the
morning
when
he
intended
to
make
a
call
which
should
be
less
involuntary
the
moment
he
was
gone
the
little
girls
laid
hands
on
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
been
employed
as
they
expected
it
was
covered
with
scraps
of
sketches
and
they
exclaimed
with
delight
look
here
here
is
the
spring
how
fond
mr
hope
is
of
drawing
the
spring
and
here
is
the
at
dingleford
and
what
is
this
here
is
a
place
we
do
know
papa
i
do
not
know
how
you
should
my
dears
it
is
the
abbey
ruin
down
the
river
which
i
rather
think
you
have
never
seen
no
but
we
should
like
to
see
it
are
there
no
faces
this
time
fanny
none
anywhere
no
funny
faces
this
time
i
like
them
the
best
of
mr
hope
drawings
sophia
do
let
us
show
some
of
the
faces
that
are
on
your
if
you
will
be
sure
and
put
them
away
again
but
you
know
if
mr
hope
is
ever
reminded
of
them
he
will
be
sure
to
rub
them
out
he
did
old
owen
fishing
so
that
he
ca
rub
it
out
if
he
would
said
sydney
he
did
it
in
ink
for
me
and
that
is
better
than
any
of
your
sketches
that
will
rub
out
in
a
minute
come
children
said
their
father
it
is
an
hour
past
your
bedtime
when
the
children
were
gone
and
sophia
was
attending
the
sisters
to
their
apartment
mrs
grey
looked
at
her
husband
over
her
spectacles
well
my
dear
said
she
well
my
dear
responded
mr
grey
do
not
you
think
hester
very
handsome
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
my
dear
she
is
very
handsome
do
not
you
think
mr
hope
thinks
so
too
it
is
a
fact
which
few
but
the
despisers
of
their
race
like
to
acknowledge
and
which
those
despisers
of
their
race
are
therefore
apt
to
interpret
wrongly
and
are
enabled
to
make
too
much
of
that
it
is
perfectly
natural
so
natural
as
to
appear
necessary
that
when
young
people
first
meet
the
possibility
of
their
falling
in
love
should
occur
to
all
the
minds
present
we
have
no
doubt
that
it
always
is
so
though
we
are
perfectly
aware
that
the
idea
speedily
goes
out
again
as
naturally
as
it
came
in
and
in
no
case
so
speedily
and
naturally
as
in
the
minds
of
the
parties
most
nearly
concerned
from
the
moment
that
the
concern
becomes
very
near
indeed
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
minds
in
mr
grey
underwent
the
common
succession
of
ideas
slight
and
transient
imaginations
which
pass
into
nothingness
when
unexpressed
probably
the
sisters
wondered
whether
mr
hope
was
married
whether
he
was
engaged
whether
he
was
meant
for
sophia
in
the
prospect
of
her
growing
old
enough
probably
each
speculated
for
half
a
moment
unconsciously
for
her
sister
and
sophia
for
both
probably
mr
grey
might
reflect
that
when
young
people
are
in
the
way
of
meeting
frequently
in
country
excursions
a
love
affair
is
no
very
unnatural
result
but
mrs
grey
was
the
only
one
who
fixed
the
idea
in
her
own
mind
and
another
by
speaking
of
it
do
not
you
think
mr
hope
thinks
hester
very
handsome
mr
grey
i
really
know
nothing
about
it
my
dear
he
did
not
speak
on
the
subject
as
he
mounted
his
horse
and
that
is
the
only
opportunity
he
has
had
of
saying
anything
about
the
young
ladies
it
would
have
been
strange
if
he
had
then
before
sydney
and
the
servants
very
strange
indeed
but
do
you
not
think
he
must
have
been
struck
with
her
i
should
like
very
well
to
have
her
settled
here
and
the
of
mr
rowland
might
do
nicely
for
them
i
do
not
know
what
mrs
rowland
would
think
of
mr
hope
marrying
into
our
connection
so
decidedly
my
dear
said
her
husband
smiling
just
consider
for
anything
we
know
these
young
ladies
may
both
be
attached
and
engaged
hope
may
be
attached
elsewhere
no
that
i
will
answer
for
it
he
is
not
i
well
you
may
have
your
reasons
for
being
sure
on
that
head
but
he
may
not
like
the
girls
they
may
not
like
him
in
short
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
is
that
they
have
seen
each
other
for
one
quarter
of
an
hour
well
there
is
no
saying
what
may
come
of
it
very
true
let
us
wait
and
see
but
there
is
no
harm
in
my
telling
you
whatever
comes
into
my
head
none
in
the
world
unless
you
get
it
so
fixed
there
that
somebody
else
happens
to
know
it
too
be
careful
my
dear
let
no
one
of
these
young
people
get
a
glimpse
of
your
speculation
think
of
the
consequence
to
them
and
to
yourself
dear
me
mr
grey
you
need
not
be
afraid
what
a
serious
matter
you
make
of
a
word
or
two
because
a
good
many
ideas
belong
to
that
word
or
two
my
dear
chapter
two
moonlight
to
townsfolk
the
moment
the
door
closed
behind
sophia
as
she
left
the
sisters
in
their
apartment
hester
crossed
the
room
with
a
step
very
like
a
dance
and
threw
up
the
window
i
had
rather
look
out
than
sleep
said
she
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
close
my
eyes
on
such
a
prospect
morris
if
you
are
waiting
for
us
you
may
go
i
shall
sit
up
a
long
while
yet
morris
thought
she
had
not
seen
hester
in
such
spirits
since
her
father
death
she
was
unwilling
to
check
them
but
said
something
about
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
and
being
fresh
for
the
next
day
no
fear
for
morris
we
are
in
the
country
you
know
and
i
can
not
fancy
being
tired
in
the
fields
and
in
such
a
park
as
that
morris
when
she
too
was
gone
hester
called
margaret
to
her
put
her
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
you
seem
happy
hester
said
margaret
gentle
voice
yes
sighed
hester
more
like
being
happy
than
for
a
long
time
past
how
little
we
know
what
we
shall
feel
here
have
i
been
dreading
and
dreading
this
evening
and
shrinking
from
the
idea
of
meeting
the
greys
and
wanting
to
write
at
the
last
moment
to
say
that
we
would
not
come
and
it
turns
out
oh
so
differently
think
of
day
after
day
week
after
week
of
pure
country
life
when
they
were
planning
for
us
and
talking
of
the
brook
and
lanes
and
meadows
it
made
my
very
heart
dance
thank
god
said
margaret
when
your
heart
dances
there
is
nothing
left
to
wish
but
did
not
yours
had
you
ever
such
a
prospect
before
such
a
prospect
of
delicious
pleasure
for
weeks
together
except
perhaps
when
we
caught
our
first
sight
of
the
sea
nothing
can
ever
equal
that
replied
margaret
do
not
you
hear
now
the
shout
we
gave
when
we
saw
the
sparkles
on
the
horizon
heaving
sparkles
when
we
were
a
mile
off
and
mamma
held
me
up
that
i
might
see
it
better
and
baby
dear
baby
clapped
his
little
hands
does
it
not
seem
like
yesterday
like
yesterday
and
yet
if
baby
had
lived
he
would
now
have
been
our
companion
taking
the
place
of
all
other
friends
to
us
i
thought
of
him
when
i
saw
sydney
grey
but
he
would
have
been
very
unlike
sydney
grey
he
would
have
been
five
years
older
but
still
different
from
what
sydney
will
be
at
eighteen
graver
more
manly
how
strange
is
the
idea
of
having
a
brother
said
margaret
i
never
see
girls
with
their
brothers
but
i
watch
them
and
long
to
feel
what
it
is
just
for
one
hour
i
wonder
what
difference
it
would
have
made
between
you
and
me
if
we
had
had
a
brother
you
and
he
would
have
been
close
friends
always
together
and
i
should
have
been
left
alone
said
hester
with
a
sigh
oh
yes
she
continued
interrupting
margaret
protest
it
would
have
been
so
there
can
never
be
the
same
friendship
between
three
as
between
two
and
why
should
you
have
been
the
one
left
out
asked
margaret
but
this
is
all
nonsense
all
a
dream
she
added
the
reality
is
that
baby
died
still
a
baby
and
we
know
no
more
of
what
he
would
have
been
than
of
what
he
is
the
real
truth
is
that
you
and
i
are
alone
to
be
each
other
only
friend
it
makes
me
tremble
to
think
of
it
margaret
it
is
not
so
long
since
our
home
seemed
full
how
we
used
all
to
sit
round
the
fire
and
laugh
and
play
with
papa
as
if
we
were
not
to
separate
till
we
had
all
grown
old
and
now
young
as
we
are
here
we
are
alone
how
do
we
know
that
we
shall
be
left
to
each
other
there
is
only
one
thing
we
can
do
hester
said
margaret
resting
her
head
on
her
sister
shoulder
we
must
make
the
most
of
being
together
while
we
can
there
must
not
be
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
between
us
for
a
moment
our
confidence
must
be
as
full
and
free
our
whole
minds
as
absolutely
open
as
as
i
have
read
and
heard
that
two
minds
can
never
be
those
who
say
so
do
not
know
what
may
be
exclaimed
hester
i
am
sure
there
is
not
a
thought
a
feeling
in
me
that
i
could
not
tell
you
though
i
know
i
never
could
to
any
one
else
if
i
were
to
lose
you
hester
there
are
many
many
things
that
would
be
shut
up
in
me
for
ever
there
will
never
be
any
one
on
earth
to
whom
i
could
say
the
things
that
i
can
tell
to
you
do
you
believe
this
hester
i
do
i
know
it
then
you
will
never
again
doubt
me
as
you
certainly
have
done
sometimes
you
can
not
imagine
how
my
heart
sinks
when
i
see
you
are
fancying
that
i
care
for
somebody
else
more
than
for
you
when
you
think
that
i
am
feeling
differently
from
you
oh
hester
i
know
every
change
of
your
thoughts
by
your
face
and
indeed
your
thoughts
have
been
mistaken
sometimes
they
have
been
wicked
often
said
hester
in
a
low
voice
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
i
must
be
hopelessly
bad
when
i
have
found
that
the
strongest
affection
i
have
in
the
world
has
made
me
unjust
and
cruel
to
the
person
i
love
best
i
have
a
jealous
temper
margaret
and
a
jealous
temper
is
a
wicked
temper
now
you
are
unkind
to
yourself
hester
i
do
believe
you
will
never
doubt
me
again
i
never
will
and
if
i
find
a
thought
of
the
kind
rising
in
me
i
will
tell
you
the
moment
i
am
aware
of
it
do
and
i
will
tell
you
the
moment
i
see
a
trace
of
such
a
thought
in
your
face
so
we
shall
be
safe
we
can
never
misunderstand
each
other
for
more
than
a
moment
by
the
gentle
leave
of
heaven
all
human
beings
have
visions
not
the
lowest
and
dullest
but
has
the
coarseness
of
his
life
relieved
at
moments
by
some
scenery
of
hope
rising
through
the
brooding
fogs
of
his
intellect
and
his
heart
such
visitations
of
mercy
are
the
privilege
of
the
innocent
and
the
support
of
the
infirm
here
were
the
lonely
sisters
sustained
in
bereavement
and
by
the
vision
of
a
friendship
which
should
be
unearthly
in
its
depth
and
freedom
they
were
so
happy
for
the
hour
that
nothing
could
disturb
them
i
do
not
see
observed
hester
that
it
will
be
possible
to
enjoy
any
intimate
intercourse
with
this
family
unless
they
are
of
a
different
order
from
what
they
seem
we
can
not
have
much
in
common
but
i
am
sure
they
mean
to
be
kind
and
they
will
let
us
be
happy
in
our
own
way
oh
what
mornings
you
and
i
will
have
together
in
those
woods
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
soft
as
they
look
in
this
light
and
the
bend
of
the
river
glittering
there
here
a
little
more
this
way
and
you
will
see
it
as
i
do
the
moon
is
not
at
the
full
yet
the
river
will
be
like
this
for
some
nights
to
come
and
these
rides
and
drives
i
hope
nothing
will
prevent
our
going
through
the
whole
list
of
them
what
is
the
matter
margaret
why
are
you
so
cool
about
them
i
think
all
the
pleasure
depends
upon
the
companionship
and
i
have
some
doubts
about
that
i
had
rather
sit
at
work
in
a
all
day
than
go
among
mountains
with
people
like
the
mansons
oh
that
spreading
of
shawls
and
bustle
about
the
sandwiches
before
they
could
give
a
look
at
the
waterfall
i
am
afraid
we
may
find
something
of
the
same
drawback
here
i
am
afraid
so
well
only
let
us
get
out
into
the
woods
and
lanes
and
we
will
manage
to
enjoy
ourselves
there
we
can
contrive
to
digress
here
and
there
together
without
being
missed
but
i
think
we
are
judging
rather
hastily
from
what
we
saw
this
evening
even
about
this
family
and
we
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
all
their
acquaintance
are
like
them
no
indeed
and
i
am
sure
mr
hope
for
one
is
of
a
different
order
he
dropped
one
thing
one
little
saying
which
proved
this
to
my
mind
i
know
what
you
mean
about
the
old
man
that
is
to
be
our
guide
over
that
heath
they
were
talking
of
about
why
that
heath
is
a
different
and
more
beautiful
place
to
him
than
to
us
or
to
his
former
self
is
it
not
true
what
he
said
i
am
sure
it
is
true
i
have
little
to
say
of
my
own
experience
or
wisdom
or
goodness
whichever
it
was
that
he
particularly
meant
as
giving
a
new
power
of
sight
to
the
old
man
but
i
know
that
no
tree
waves
to
my
eye
as
it
did
ten
years
ago
and
the
music
of
running
water
is
richer
to
my
ear
as
every
summer
comes
round
yes
i
almost
wonder
sometimes
whether
all
things
are
not
made
at
the
moment
by
the
mind
that
sees
them
so
wonderfully
do
they
change
with
one
mood
and
according
to
the
store
of
thoughts
they
lay
open
in
one
mind
if
i
lived
in
a
desert
island
supposing
one
intellect
could
go
on
to
grow
there
i
should
feel
sure
of
this
but
not
here
where
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
village
sot
if
there
be
one
and
mr
hope
and
the
children
and
we
ourselves
all
see
the
same
objects
in
sunlight
and
moonlight
and
acknowledge
them
to
be
the
same
though
we
can
not
measure
feelings
upon
them
i
wish
mr
hope
may
say
something
more
which
may
lead
to
the
old
man
on
the
heath
again
he
is
coming
morning
yes
we
shall
see
him
again
chapter
three
making
acquaintance
the
sisters
were
not
so
fatigued
with
their
journey
but
that
they
were
early
in
the
open
air
the
next
morning
in
the
shrubbery
they
met
the
twins
walking
hand
in
hand
each
with
a
doll
on
the
disengaged
arm
you
are
giving
your
dolls
an
airing
before
breakfast
said
hester
stopping
them
as
they
would
have
passed
on
yes
we
carry
out
our
dolls
now
because
we
must
not
run
before
breakfast
we
have
made
arbours
in
our
own
gardens
for
our
dolls
where
they
may
sit
when
we
are
swinging
i
should
like
to
see
your
arbours
and
your
gardens
said
margaret
looking
round
her
will
you
take
me
to
them
not
now
answered
they
we
should
have
to
cross
the
grass
and
we
must
not
go
upon
the
grass
before
breakfast
where
is
your
swing
i
am
very
fond
of
swinging
oh
it
is
in
the
orchard
there
under
that
large
tree
but
you
can
not
i
see
we
can
not
get
to
it
now
because
we
should
have
to
cross
the
grass
and
margaret
began
to
look
round
for
any
place
where
they
might
go
beyond
the
on
which
they
stood
she
moved
towards
the
greenhouse
but
found
it
was
never
unlocked
before
breakfast
the
summerhouse
remained
and
a
most
unexceptionable
path
led
to
it
the
sisters
turned
that
way
you
can
not
go
there
cried
the
children
miss
young
always
has
the
schoolroom
before
breakfast
we
are
going
to
see
miss
young
explained
hester
smiling
at
the
amazed
faces
with
which
the
children
stared
from
the
end
of
the
path
they
were
suddenly
seen
to
turn
and
walk
as
fast
as
they
could
without
its
being
called
running
towards
the
house
they
were
gone
to
their
mother
door
to
tell
her
that
the
miss
ibbotsons
were
gone
to
see
miss
young
before
breakfast
the
path
led
for
some
little
way
under
the
hedge
which
separated
mr
grey
from
mr
rowland
garden
there
were
voices
on
the
other
side
and
what
was
said
was
perfectly
audible
uneasy
at
hearing
what
was
not
meant
for
them
hester
and
margaret
gave
tokens
of
their
presence
the
conversation
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
proceeded
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
sisters
were
persuaded
that
they
had
been
mistaken
in
supposing
that
what
was
said
was
not
meant
for
them
my
own
matilda
said
a
voice
which
evidently
came
from
under
a
bonnet
which
moved
parallel
with
hester
and
margaret
my
own
matilda
i
would
not
be
so
harsh
as
to
prevent
your
playing
where
you
please
before
breakfast
run
where
you
like
my
love
i
am
sorry
for
little
girls
who
are
not
allowed
to
do
as
they
please
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
my
children
shall
never
suffer
such
restriction
mother
cried
a
rough
little
person
i
going
fishing
with
uncle
philip
sydney
grey
and
i
are
going
i
do
know
how
far
up
the
river
on
no
account
my
dear
boy
you
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
i
should
not
have
a
moment
peace
while
you
are
away
you
would
not
be
back
till
evening
perhaps
and
i
should
be
fancying
all
day
that
you
were
in
the
river
it
is
out
of
the
question
my
own
george
but
i
must
go
mother
uncle
philip
said
i
might
and
sydney
grey
is
going
that
is
only
another
reason
my
dear
boy
your
uncle
will
yield
to
my
wishes
i
am
sure
as
he
always
does
and
if
mrs
grey
allows
her
son
to
run
such
risks
i
am
sure
i
should
not
feel
myself
justified
you
will
stay
with
me
love
wo
you
you
will
stay
with
your
mother
my
own
boy
george
ran
roaring
away
screaming
for
uncle
philip
who
was
not
at
hand
however
to
plead
his
cause
my
matilda
resumed
the
fond
mother
you
are
making
yourself
a
sad
figure
you
will
not
be
fit
to
show
yourself
at
breakfast
do
you
suppose
your
papa
ever
saw
such
a
frock
as
that
there
look
dripping
wet
pritchard
take
miss
matilda
and
change
all
her
clothes
directly
so
much
for
my
allowing
her
to
run
on
the
grass
while
the
dew
is
on
lose
no
time
pritchard
lest
the
child
should
catch
cold
leave
miss
anna
with
me
walk
beside
me
my
anna
ah
there
is
papa
papa
we
must
find
some
amusement
for
george
today
as
i
can
not
think
of
letting
him
go
out
fishing
suppose
we
take
the
children
to
spend
the
morning
with
their
cousins
at
dingleford
would
suit
me
better
my
love
replied
the
husband
indeed
i
do
see
how
i
can
go
or
you
either
and
mr
rowland
lowered
his
voice
so
as
to
show
that
he
was
aware
of
his
liability
to
be
overheard
oh
as
to
that
there
is
no
hurry
replied
the
lady
aloud
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
i
should
not
make
that
call
any
day
will
do
as
well
as
hester
and
margaret
looked
at
each
other
they
heard
the
gentleman
softly
say
hush
but
mrs
rowland
went
on
as
audibly
as
ever
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
in
any
hurry
to
call
on
mrs
friends
whoever
and
whatever
they
may
be
any
day
will
do
for
that
my
dear
not
having
been
yet
forbidden
to
run
before
breakfast
hester
and
margaret
fled
to
the
to
avoid
hearing
any
more
of
the
domestic
dialogues
of
the
rowland
family
what
shall
we
do
when
that
woman
calls
said
hester
how
will
it
be
possible
to
speak
to
her
as
we
should
speak
to
any
other
indifferent
person
replied
margaret
her
rudeness
is
meant
for
mrs
grey
not
for
us
for
she
knows
nothing
about
us
and
mrs
grey
will
never
hear
from
us
what
has
shall
we
knock
in
answer
to
the
knock
they
were
requested
to
enter
miss
young
rose
in
some
confusion
when
she
found
her
visitors
were
other
than
her
pupils
but
she
was
so
lame
that
hester
made
her
sit
down
again
while
they
drew
seats
for
themselves
they
apologised
for
breaking
in
upon
her
with
so
little
ceremony
but
explained
that
they
were
come
to
be
inmates
at
mr
grey
for
some
months
and
that
they
wished
to
lose
no
time
in
making
themselves
acquainted
with
every
resort
of
the
family
of
which
they
considered
themselves
a
part
miss
young
was
evidently
pleased
to
see
them
she
closed
her
volume
and
assured
them
they
were
welcome
to
her
apartment
for
said
she
everybody
calls
it
my
apartment
and
why
should
not
i
do
you
spend
all
your
time
here
asked
hester
almost
the
whole
day
i
have
a
lodging
in
the
village
but
i
leave
it
early
these
fine
mornings
and
stay
here
till
dark
i
am
so
lame
as
to
make
it
inconvenient
to
pass
over
the
ground
oftener
than
is
necessary
and
i
find
it
pleasanter
to
see
trees
and
grass
through
every
window
here
than
to
look
out
into
the
farrier
yard
the
only
prospect
from
my
lodging
the
furnace
and
sparks
are
pretty
enough
on
a
evening
especially
when
one
is
too
ill
or
too
dismal
to
do
anything
but
watch
them
but
at
this
season
one
grows
tired
of
old
and
cinders
and
so
i
sit
here
to
the
sisters
there
seemed
a
world
of
desolation
in
these
words
they
were
always
mourning
for
having
no
brother
here
was
one
who
appeared
to
be
entirely
alone
from
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
margaret
opened
the
book
miss
young
had
laid
aside
it
was
german
thirty
years
war
every
one
has
something
to
say
about
german
literature
those
who
do
not
understand
it
asking
whether
it
is
not
very
mystical
and
wild
and
obscure
and
those
who
do
understand
it
saying
that
it
is
not
so
at
all
it
would
be
a
welcome
novelty
if
the
two
parties
were
to
set
about
finding
out
what
it
is
to
be
mystical
a
point
which
for
aught
that
is
known
to
the
generality
is
not
yet
ascertained
miss
young
and
her
visitors
did
not
enter
upon
precise
definitions
this
morning
these
were
left
for
a
future
occasion
meantime
it
was
ascertained
that
miss
young
had
learned
the
german
language
by
the
aid
of
dictionary
and
grammar
alone
and
also
that
if
she
should
happen
to
meet
with
any
one
who
wished
to
enjoy
what
she
was
enjoying
she
should
be
glad
to
afford
any
aid
in
her
power
hester
was
satisfied
with
thanking
her
she
was
old
enough
to
know
that
learning
a
new
language
is
a
serious
undertaking
margaret
was
somewhat
younger
and
ready
for
any
enterprise
she
thought
she
saw
before
her
hours
of
long
mornings
when
she
should
be
glad
to
escape
from
the
to
miss
young
companionship
and
to
study
the
bright
field
of
german
literature
seemed
to
open
before
her
to
be
explored
she
warmly
thanked
miss
young
and
accepted
her
offered
assistance
so
you
spend
all
your
days
alone
here
said
she
looking
round
upon
the
rather
bare
walls
the
matted
floor
the
children
desks
and
the
single
shelf
which
held
miss
young
books
not
exactly
all
the
day
alone
replied
miss
young
the
children
are
with
me
five
hours
a
day
and
a
set
of
pupils
from
the
village
comes
to
me
besides
for
a
spare
hour
of
the
afternoon
in
this
way
i
see
a
good
many
little
faces
every
day
and
some
others
too
i
should
hope
some
besides
little
faces
miss
young
was
silent
margaret
hastened
on
i
suppose
most
people
would
say
here
what
is
said
everywhere
else
about
the
nobleness
and
privilege
of
the
task
of
teaching
children
but
i
do
not
envy
those
who
have
it
to
do
i
am
as
fond
of
children
as
any
one
but
then
it
is
having
them
out
to
play
on
the
grass
or
romping
with
them
in
the
nursery
that
i
like
when
it
becomes
a
matter
of
desks
and
i
had
far
rather
study
than
teach
i
believe
everybody
except
perhaps
mothers
would
agree
with
you
said
miss
young
who
was
now
without
apology
plying
her
needle
indeed
then
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
thank
you
but
there
no
need
to
be
sorry
for
me
do
you
suppose
that
one
comfort
lies
in
having
a
choice
of
employments
my
experience
leads
me
to
think
the
contrary
i
do
not
think
i
could
be
happy
said
hester
to
be
tied
down
to
an
employment
i
did
not
like
not
to
a
positively
disgusting
one
but
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
the
greatest
number
of
happy
people
may
be
found
busy
in
employments
that
they
have
not
chosen
for
themselves
and
never
would
have
chosen
i
am
afraid
these
very
happy
people
are
haunted
by
longings
to
be
doing
something
else
yes
there
is
their
great
trouble
they
think
till
experience
makes
them
wiser
that
if
they
were
only
in
another
set
of
circumstances
if
they
only
had
a
choice
what
they
would
do
a
chance
for
the
exercise
of
the
powers
they
are
conscious
of
they
would
do
such
things
as
should
be
the
wonder
and
the
terror
of
the
earth
but
their
powers
may
be
doubted
if
they
do
not
appear
in
the
conquest
of
circumstances
so
you
conquer
these
giddy
children
when
you
had
rather
be
conquering
german
metaphysicians
or
or
what
else
there
is
little
to
conquer
in
these
children
said
miss
young
they
are
very
good
with
me
i
assure
you
i
have
much
more
to
conquer
in
myself
with
regard
to
them
it
is
but
little
that
i
can
do
for
them
and
that
little
i
am
apt
to
despise
in
the
vain
desire
to
do
more
how
more
if
i
had
them
in
a
house
by
myself
to
spend
their
whole
time
with
me
so
that
i
could
educate
instead
of
merely
teaching
them
but
here
i
am
doing
just
what
we
were
talking
of
just
now
laying
out
a
field
of
duty
in
which
there
would
probably
be
as
many
thorns
as
in
any
other
teaching
has
its
pleasures
its
great
occasional
and
small
daily
pleasures
though
they
are
not
to
be
compared
to
the
sublime
delights
of
education
you
must
have
some
of
these
sublime
delights
mixed
in
with
the
humbler
you
are
in
some
degree
educating
these
children
while
teaching
them
yes
but
it
is
more
a
negative
than
a
positive
function
a
very
humble
one
governesses
to
children
at
home
can
do
little
more
than
stand
between
children
and
the
faults
of
the
people
about
them
i
speak
quite
generally
is
such
an
occupation
one
in
which
anybody
can
be
happy
why
not
as
well
as
in
making
pins
heads
or
in
nursing
sick
people
or
in
cutting
square
blocks
out
of
a
chalk
pit
for
thirty
years
together
or
in
any
other
occupation
which
may
be
ordained
to
prove
to
us
that
happiness
lies
in
the
temper
and
not
in
the
object
of
a
pursuit
are
there
not
free
and
happy
and
and
yes
but
they
know
how
much
to
expect
they
have
no
idea
of
in
itself
being
great
happiness
just
so
well
let
a
governess
learn
what
to
expect
set
her
free
from
a
hankering
after
happiness
in
her
work
and
you
have
a
happy
governess
i
thought
such
a
thing
was
out
of
the
order
of
nature
not
quite
there
have
been
such
though
there
are
strong
influences
against
it
the
expectations
of
all
parties
are
unreasonable
and
those
who
are
too
humble
or
too
amiable
to
be
dissatisfied
with
others
are
discontented
with
themselves
when
the
inevitable
disappointment
comes
there
is
a
great
deal
said
about
the
evils
of
the
position
of
a
governess
between
the
family
and
the
servants
a
great
deal
said
that
is
very
true
and
always
will
be
true
while
governesses
have
proud
hearts
like
other
people
but
these
are
slight
evils
in
comparison
with
the
grand
one
of
the
common
failure
of
the
there
do
you
hear
that
bell
what
is
it
the
breakfast
bell
yes
you
must
go
i
would
not
be
understood
as
inviting
you
here
for
it
is
not
except
upon
sufferance
my
room
and
i
have
no
inducement
to
offer
but
i
may
just
say
that
you
will
always
be
welcome
always
said
margaret
in
and
out
of
school
hours
in
and
out
of
school
hours
unless
your
presence
should
chance
to
turn
my
pupils
heads
in
that
case
you
will
not
be
offended
if
i
ask
you
to
go
away
mary
and
fanny
had
just
reported
in
the
that
the
miss
ibbotsons
had
been
such
a
time
with
miss
young
when
hester
and
margaret
entered
the
testimony
there
was
all
in
favour
of
miss
young
mr
grey
called
her
a
most
estimable
young
woman
and
mrs
grey
declared
that
though
she
could
not
agree
with
her
on
all
points
and
decidedly
thought
that
she
overrated
matilda
rowland
talents
she
was
convinced
that
her
children
enjoyed
great
advantages
under
her
care
sophia
added
that
she
was
very
superior
quite
learned
mrs
grey
further
explained
that
though
now
so
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
of
her
daughters
education
no
one
could
have
an
idea
of
the
trouble
she
had
had
in
getting
the
plan
arranged
it
had
seemed
a
pity
that
the
rowlands
and
her
children
should
not
learn
together
it
was
such
an
advantage
for
children
to
learn
together
but
mrs
rowland
had
made
a
thousand
difficulties
after
breakfast
she
would
show
her
young
friends
the
room
which
she
had
proposed
should
be
the
schoolroom
as
airy
and
advantageous
in
every
way
as
could
be
imagined
but
mrs
rowland
had
objected
that
she
could
not
have
matilda
and
george
come
out
in
all
weathers
as
if
they
would
have
had
to
walk
a
mile
instead
of
just
the
sweep
of
the
mrs
rowland
had
proposed
that
her
should
be
the
schoolroom
but
really
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
small
and
close
and
such
a
dull
room
for
miss
young
the
gentlemen
had
been
obliged
to
take
it
up
at
last
nobody
could
ever
find
out
which
of
them
it
was
that
had
thought
of
the
summerhouse
though
she
was
satisfied
in
her
own
mind
that
mr
rowland
was
not
in
the
habit
of
having
such
clever
ideas
but
however
it
was
soon
settled
the
was
so
exactly
on
the
between
the
two
gardens
that
really
no
objection
had
been
left
for
mrs
rowland
to
make
she
came
as
near
to
it
as
she
could
however
for
she
had
had
the
walk
covered
in
at
great
expense
from
her
garden
door
to
the
when
everybody
knew
she
did
not
mind
her
children
getting
wet
at
other
times
on
the
grass
before
the
dew
was
off
and
the
covered
way
is
quite
an
eyesore
from
the
windows
added
sophia
quite
said
mrs
grey
and
it
can
be
seen
from
ours
as
i
dare
say
you
observed
last
night
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
entered
into
her
calculations
when
she
had
it
made
mr
grey
inquired
about
the
arrangements
for
the
morning
and
whether
he
could
be
of
any
service
it
happened
to
be
a
leisure
morning
with
him
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
might
have
another
at
command
sophia
reminded
her
father
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
ladies
of
the
family
to
go
out
when
they
were
expecting
the
neighbours
to
call
and
this
brought
on
another
speculation
as
to
who
would
call
and
especially
when
the
rowlands
might
be
looked
for
hester
and
margaret
believed
they
could
have
settled
this
matter
but
they
forbore
to
speak
of
what
they
had
overheard
they
began
to
wonder
whether
the
subject
of
mrs
rowland
was
to
be
served
up
with
every
meal
for
a
continuance
and
hester
found
her
anticipations
of
delight
in
a
country
life
somewhat
damped
by
the
idea
of
the
frowning
ghost
of
the
obnoxious
lady
being
for
ever
present
chapter
four
morning
calls
the
little
girls
had
been
dismissed
to
the
schoolroom
before
mr
grey
had
finally
pushed
away
his
not
being
wanted
by
the
ladies
he
walked
off
to
his
and
his
wife
followed
to
ask
him
some
question
not
intended
for
the
general
ear
sophia
was
struck
with
a
sudden
panic
at
being
left
alone
with
the
strangers
and
escaped
by
another
door
into
the
as
the
last
traces
of
the
breakfast
things
vanished
hester
exclaimed
so
we
may
please
ourselves
it
seems
as
to
what
we
are
to
do
with
our
morning
i
hope
so
said
margaret
do
let
us
get
down
to
the
meadow
we
see
from
our
window
the
meadow
that
looks
so
flat
and
green
we
may
very
well
take
two
hours
grace
before
we
need
sit
down
here
in
form
and
order
hester
was
willing
and
the
bonnets
were
soon
on
as
margaret
was
passing
down
stairs
again
she
saw
mrs
grey
and
sophia
whispering
in
a
room
the
door
of
which
stood
open
she
heard
it
shut
instantly
and
the
result
of
the
consultation
soon
appeared
just
as
the
sisters
were
turning
out
of
the
house
sophia
ran
after
them
to
say
that
mamma
wished
they
would
be
so
good
as
to
defer
their
walk
mamma
was
afraid
that
if
they
were
seen
abroad
in
the
village
it
would
be
supposed
that
they
did
not
wish
to
receive
visitors
mamma
would
rather
that
they
should
stay
within
this
morning
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
back
and
hester
threw
down
her
bonnet
with
no
very
good
grace
as
she
observed
to
her
sister
that
to
all
appearance
a
town
life
was
more
free
than
a
country
one
after
all
let
us
do
our
duty
fully
this
first
morning
said
margaret
look
i
am
going
to
carry
down
my
and
you
shall
see
me
sit
on
the
same
chair
from
this
hour
till
unless
i
receive
directions
to
the
contrary
the
restraint
did
not
amount
to
this
hester
chair
was
placed
opposite
to
mrs
grey
who
seemed
to
have
pleasure
in
gazing
at
her
and
in
indulging
in
audible
hints
and
visible
winks
and
nods
about
her
beauty
to
every
lady
visitor
who
sat
near
her
margaret
might
place
herself
where
she
pleased
in
the
intervals
of
the
visits
of
the
morning
she
was
treated
with
a
diversity
of
entertainments
by
sophia
who
occasionally
summoned
her
to
the
window
to
see
how
matilda
rowland
was
allowed
to
run
across
the
road
to
her
grandmamma
without
so
much
as
a
hat
upon
her
head
to
see
jim
bird
the
oldest
man
in
the
parish
believed
to
be
near
a
hundred
who
was
resting
himself
on
the
bank
of
the
hedge
to
see
the
peacock
which
had
been
sent
as
a
present
from
sir
william
hunter
to
mr
james
the
lawyer
and
which
was
a
great
nuisance
from
its
screaming
to
say
whether
the
two
little
reeves
dropping
their
curtseys
as
they
went
home
from
school
were
not
little
beauties
and
in
short
to
witness
all
the
village
spectacles
which
present
themselves
before
the
windows
of
an
acute
observer
on
a
fine
spring
morning
the
young
ladies
had
to
return
to
their
seats
as
often
as
wheels
were
heard
or
the
approach
of
parasols
was
discerned
among
the
earliest
visitors
were
mrs
enderby
and
her
redoubtable
son
mr
philip
mrs
enderby
was
a
brisk
little
old
lady
who
was
rather
apt
to
talk
herself
quite
out
of
breath
but
who
had
evidently
a
stronger
tendency
still
and
that
was
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
everything
and
everybody
she
smiled
smiles
full
of
meaning
and
assent
in
return
for
mrs
grey
winks
about
hester
beauty
and
really
cheered
hester
with
accounts
of
how
good
everybody
was
at
deerbrook
she
was
thankful
that
her
maid
phoebe
was
better
she
knew
that
mrs
grey
would
not
fail
to
inquire
really
phoebe
was
very
much
better
the
influenza
had
left
sad
effects
but
they
were
dispersing
it
would
be
a
pity
the
girl
should
not
quite
recover
for
she
was
a
most
invaluable
servant
such
a
servant
as
is
very
rarely
to
be
met
with
the
credit
of
restoring
her
belonged
to
mr
hope
who
indeed
had
done
everything
she
supposed
the
ladies
would
soon
be
seeing
mr
hope
he
was
extremely
busy
as
everybody
knew
had
very
large
practice
now
but
he
always
contrived
to
find
time
for
everything
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
find
time
for
everything
there
was
her
dear
daughter
priscilla
mrs
rowland
whose
husband
was
mr
grey
partner
priscilla
devoted
her
life
to
her
children
and
dear
children
they
were
and
no
one
who
knew
what
she
did
for
her
children
would
expect
anything
more
from
her
but
indeed
those
who
knew
best
she
herself
for
instance
were
fully
satisfied
that
her
dear
priscilla
did
wonders
the
apology
for
mrs
rowland
in
case
she
should
not
call
was
made
not
without
ingenuity
hester
fully
understood
it
and
mrs
grey
showed
by
her
bridling
that
it
was
not
lost
upon
her
either
mr
enderby
meanwhile
was
behaving
civilly
to
margaret
and
sophia
that
is
to
say
he
was
somewhat
more
than
merely
civil
to
margaret
and
somewhat
less
to
sophia
it
was
obviously
not
without
reason
that
sophia
had
complained
of
his
hauteur
he
could
not
as
sydney
had
pleaded
help
being
tall
but
he
might
have
helped
the
excessive
frigidity
with
which
he
stood
upright
till
invited
to
sit
down
the
fact
was
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
ladies
of
mr
family
made
very
free
with
his
sister
name
and
affairs
and
though
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
have
been
obliged
to
defend
all
she
said
and
did
he
felt
some
very
natural
emotions
of
dislike
towards
those
who
were
always
putting
the
worst
construction
upon
the
whole
of
her
conduct
he
believed
that
mr
grey
influence
was
exerted
on
behalf
of
peace
and
good
understanding
and
he
thought
he
perceived
that
sydney
with
the
shrewdness
which
some
boys
show
very
early
was
more
or
less
sensible
of
the
absurdity
of
the
feud
between
the
partners
wives
and
daughters
and
towards
these
members
of
the
grey
family
mr
enderby
felt
nothing
but
he
talked
politics
with
mr
grey
in
the
shrubbery
after
church
on
sunday
executed
commissions
for
him
in
london
and
sent
him
game
and
sydney
was
under
obligations
to
him
for
many
a
morning
of
sport
and
many
a
service
such
as
gentlemen
who
are
not
above
and
its
freaks
can
render
to
boys
entering
their
teens
whatever
might
be
his
opinion
of
women
generally
from
the
particular
specimens
which
had
come
in
his
way
he
had
too
much
sense
and
gentlemanly
feeling
to
include
mrs
grey
guests
in
the
dislike
he
felt
towards
herself
or
to
suppose
that
they
must
necessarily
share
her
disposition
towards
his
relations
perhaps
he
felt
unknown
to
himself
some
inclination
to
prepossess
them
in
favour
of
his
connections
to
stretch
his
complaisance
a
little
as
a
precaution
against
the
prejudices
with
which
he
knew
mrs
grey
would
attempt
to
occupy
their
minds
however
this
might
be
he
was
as
amicable
with
margaret
as
his
mother
was
with
her
sister
he
soon
found
out
that
the
strangers
were
more
interested
about
the
natural
features
of
deerbrook
than
about
its
gossip
he
was
amused
at
the
earnestness
of
margaret
inquiries
about
the
scenery
of
the
neighbourhood
and
he
laughingly
promised
that
she
should
see
every
nook
within
twenty
miles
people
always
care
least
about
what
they
have
just
at
hand
said
he
i
dare
say
if
i
were
to
ask
you
you
have
never
seen
a
blown
or
a
painted
if
i
have
said
margaret
i
know
many
ladies
in
birmingham
who
have
not
you
will
not
be
surprised
then
if
you
find
some
ladies
in
deerbrook
who
do
not
ride
and
who
can
tell
you
no
more
of
the
pretty
places
near
than
if
they
had
been
brought
up
in
whitechapel
they
keep
their
best
sights
for
strangers
and
not
for
common
use
i
am
in
reality
only
a
visitor
at
deerbrook
i
do
not
live
here
and
never
did
yet
i
am
better
able
to
be
your
guide
than
almost
any
resident
the
ladies
especially
are
extremely
domestic
they
are
far
too
busy
to
have
ever
looked
about
them
but
i
will
speak
to
mr
grey
and
oh
pray
do
not
trouble
mr
grey
he
has
too
much
business
on
his
hands
already
and
he
is
so
kind
he
will
be
putting
himself
out
of
his
way
for
us
and
all
we
want
is
to
be
in
the
open
air
in
the
fields
you
want
very
like
starlings
in
a
cage
and
he
looked
as
if
he
was
smiling
at
the
speech
of
the
starling
but
he
did
not
quote
it
my
mother
is
now
saying
that
mr
hope
finds
time
for
everything
and
she
is
right
he
will
help
us
you
must
see
hope
and
you
must
like
him
he
is
the
great
boast
of
the
place
next
to
the
new
sign
is
the
sign
remarkable
or
only
new
very
remarkable
for
ingenuity
if
not
for
beauty
it
is
bonnet
so
blue
a
lady
bonnet
of
blue
satin
with
brown
bows
or
whatever
you
may
call
the
trimming
when
you
see
it
and
we
are
favoured
besides
with
a
portrait
of
the
milliner
holding
the
bonnet
so
blue
we
talk
nearly
as
much
of
this
sign
as
of
mr
hope
but
you
must
see
them
both
and
tell
us
which
you
like
best
we
have
seen
mr
hope
he
was
here
yesterday
evening
well
then
you
must
see
him
again
and
you
must
not
think
the
worse
of
him
for
his
being
praised
by
everybody
you
meet
it
is
no
ordinary
case
of
a
village
apothecary
margaret
laughed
so
little
did
mr
hope
look
like
the
village
apothecary
of
her
imagination
ah
i
see
you
know
something
of
the
predilection
of
villagers
for
their
apothecary
how
the
young
people
wonder
that
he
always
cures
everybody
and
how
the
old
people
could
not
live
without
him
and
how
the
poor
folks
take
him
for
a
sort
of
magician
and
how
he
obtains
more
knowledge
of
human
affairs
than
any
other
kind
of
man
but
hope
is
though
a
very
happy
man
not
this
sort
of
privileged
person
his
friends
are
so
attached
to
him
that
they
confide
to
him
all
their
own
affairs
but
they
respect
him
too
much
to
gossip
at
large
to
him
of
other
people
i
see
you
do
not
know
how
to
credit
this
but
i
assure
you
though
the
inhabitants
of
deerbrook
are
as
accomplished
in
the
arts
of
gossip
as
any
villagers
in
england
hope
knows
little
more
than
you
do
at
this
moment
about
who
are
upon
terms
and
who
are
not
my
sister
and
i
must
learn
his
art
of
ignorance
said
margaret
if
it
be
really
true
that
the
place
is
full
of
quarrels
we
shall
be
afraid
to
stay
unless
we
can
contrive
to
know
nothing
about
them
oh
do
not
suppose
we
are
worse
than
others
who
live
in
villages
since
our
present
rector
came
we
have
risen
somewhat
above
the
rural
average
of
peace
and
quiet
and
the
country
has
always
been
identical
with
the
idea
of
peace
and
quiet
to
us
people
said
margaret
and
very
properly
in
one
sense
but
if
you
leave
behind
the
din
of
streets
for
the
sake
of
stepping
forth
from
your
upon
a
soft
lawn
or
of
looking
out
upon
the
old
church
steeple
among
the
trees
while
you
hear
nothing
but
bleating
and
chirping
you
must
expect
some
against
such
advantages
and
that
is
the
being
among
a
small
number
of
people
who
are
always
busy
looking
into
one
small
concerns
but
this
is
not
a
necessary
evil
said
margaret
from
what
you
were
saying
just
now
it
appears
that
it
may
be
avoided
from
what
i
was
saying
about
hope
yes
such
an
one
as
hope
may
get
all
the
good
out
of
every
situation
without
its
evils
but
but
nobody
else
said
margaret
smiling
well
hester
and
i
must
try
whether
we
can
not
have
to
do
with
lawns
and
sheep
for
a
few
months
without
quarrelling
or
having
to
do
with
quarrels
and
what
if
you
are
made
the
subject
of
quarrels
asked
mr
enderby
how
are
you
to
help
yourselves
in
that
case
how
does
mr
hope
help
himself
in
that
case
it
remains
to
be
seen
as
far
as
i
know
the
whole
place
is
agreed
about
him
at
present
every
one
will
tell
you
that
never
was
society
so
blessed
in
a
medical
man
before
from
the
rector
and
my
mother
who
never
quarrel
with
anybody
down
to
the
village
scold
i
am
not
going
to
prepossess
you
against
even
our
village
scold
by
telling
her
name
you
will
know
it
in
time
though
your
first
acquaintance
will
probably
be
with
her
voice
so
we
are
to
hear
something
besides
bleating
and
chirping
a
tremendous
knock
at
the
door
occurred
as
if
in
answer
to
this
all
the
conversation
in
the
room
suddenly
stopped
and
mr
and
mrs
rowland
walked
in
this
is
my
sister
mrs
rowland
observed
mr
enderby
to
margaret
this
is
my
daughter
priscilla
mrs
rowland
said
mrs
enderby
to
hester
both
sisters
were
annoyed
at
feeling
timid
and
nervous
on
being
introduced
to
the
lady
there
is
something
imposing
in
hearing
a
mere
name
very
often
in
the
proof
that
the
person
it
belongs
to
fills
a
large
space
in
people
minds
and
when
the
person
is
thus
frequently
named
with
fear
and
dislike
an
idea
is
originated
of
a
command
over
powers
of
evil
which
makes
the
actual
presence
absolutely
awful
this
seemed
now
to
be
felt
by
all
sophia
had
nothing
to
say
mrs
head
twitched
nervously
while
she
turned
from
one
to
another
with
slight
remarks
mrs
enderby
ran
on
about
their
having
all
happened
to
call
at
once
and
its
being
quite
a
family
party
in
mrs
grey
parlour
and
mr
philip
flow
of
conversation
had
stopped
margaret
thought
he
was
trying
to
help
laughing
the
call
could
not
be
an
agreeable
one
the
partners
ladies
quoted
their
own
children
sayings
about
school
and
miss
young
and
miss
young
praise
of
the
children
and
each
vied
with
the
other
in
eulogium
on
miss
young
evidently
on
the
ground
of
her
hopes
of
fanny
and
mary
on
the
one
hand
and
of
matilda
george
and
anna
on
the
other
mrs
enderby
interposed
praises
of
all
the
children
while
mr
rowland
engaged
hester
attention
calling
off
her
observation
and
his
own
from
the
sparring
of
the
rival
mothers
philip
informed
margaret
at
length
that
george
was
a
fine
little
fellow
who
would
make
a
good
sportsman
there
was
some
pleasure
in
taking
such
a
boy
out
fishing
but
mr
philip
had
lighted
on
a
dangerous
topic
as
he
soon
found
his
sister
heard
what
he
was
saying
and
began
an
earnest
protest
against
little
boys
fishing
on
account
of
the
danger
and
against
any
idea
that
she
would
allow
her
george
to
run
any
such
risks
of
course
this
made
mrs
grey
fire
up
as
at
an
imputation
upon
her
care
of
her
son
sydney
and
before
the
rest
of
the
company
could
talk
down
the
dispute
it
bore
too
much
of
the
appearance
of
a
recrimination
about
the
discharge
of
maternal
duties
margaret
thought
that
but
for
the
relationship
mrs
rowland
might
fairly
be
concluded
to
be
the
village
scold
alluded
to
by
mr
enderby
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
have
been
speaking
of
his
sister
but
deerbrook
was
an
unfortunate
place
if
it
contained
a
more
unamiable
person
than
she
appeared
at
this
moment
the
faces
of
the
two
ladies
were
still
flushed
with
excitement
when
mr
hope
came
in
the
sisters
thought
he
appeared
like
a
good
genius
so
amiable
did
the
party
grow
on
his
entrance
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
as
great
a
favourite
with
the
rowlands
as
with
the
other
family
so
friendly
was
the
gentleman
and
so
gracious
the
lady
while
mr
hope
was
to
all
appearance
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
any
unpleasant
feelings
among
his
neighbours
the
talk
flowed
on
about
the
concerns
of
personages
of
the
village
about
the
aspect
of
public
affairs
about
the
poets
of
the
age
and
what
kind
of
poetry
was
most
read
in
deerbrook
and
how
the
book
society
went
on
till
all
had
grown
cordial
and
some
began
to
propose
to
be
hospitable
mrs
rowland
hoped
for
the
honour
of
seeing
the
miss
ibbotsons
one
day
the
next
week
when
mr
rowland
should
have
returned
from
a
little
excursion
of
business
mrs
enderby
wondered
whether
she
could
prevail
on
all
her
young
friends
to
spend
an
evening
with
her
before
her
son
left
deerbrook
and
mrs
grey
gave
notice
that
she
should
shortly
issue
her
invitations
to
those
with
whom
she
wished
her
young
cousins
to
become
better
acquainted
all
went
right
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
when
the
enderbys
and
rowlands
went
away
the
levitts
came
when
dr
levitt
inquired
about
the
schools
of
birmingham
it
could
not
but
come
out
that
hester
and
margaret
were
dissenters
yet
as
they
were
desired
to
observe
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
shocked
and
his
manner
was
just
as
kind
to
them
after
this
disclosure
as
before
he
was
pronounced
a
very
liberal
man
mr
hope
was
asked
to
stay
to
dinner
and
mrs
grey
complacently
related
the
events
of
the
morning
to
her
husband
as
he
took
his
place
at
table
deerbrook
had
done
its
duty
to
hester
and
margaret
pretty
well
for
the
first
day
everybody
of
consequence
had
called
but
the
andersons
and
they
would
no
doubt
come
on
sunday
chapter
five
the
meadows
the
afternoon
was
the
time
when
miss
young
pupils
practised
the
mysteries
of
the
needle
little
girls
are
not
usually
fond
of
sewing
till
they
become
clever
enough
to
have
devices
of
their
own
to
cut
out
a
doll
petticoat
or
contrive
a
to
surprise
mamma
sewing
is
a
mere
galling
of
the
fingers
and
strain
upon
the
patience
every
wry
stitch
shows
and
is
pretty
sure
to
be
remarked
upon
the
seam
or
hem
seems
longer
the
oftener
it
is
measured
till
the
little
becomes
capable
of
the
enterprise
of
despatching
a
whole
one
at
a
sitting
after
which
the
glory
is
found
to
ameliorate
the
toil
and
there
is
a
chance
that
the
girl
may
become
fond
of
sewing
miss
young
pupils
had
not
arrived
at
this
stage
it
was
a
mystery
to
them
that
miss
young
could
sit
sewing
as
fast
as
her
needle
could
fly
for
the
whole
afternoon
and
during
the
intervals
of
their
lessons
in
the
morning
it
was
in
vain
that
she
told
them
that
some
of
her
pleasantest
hours
were
those
which
she
passed
in
this
employment
and
that
she
thought
they
would
perhaps
grow
as
fond
of
work
as
their
sister
sophia
before
they
were
as
old
as
she
with
languid
steps
did
the
twins
return
to
the
house
this
afternoon
for
another
pair
of
and
to
show
mamma
the
work
they
had
finished
hand
in
hand
as
usual
and
carrying
up
for
judgment
their
last
performance
they
entered
the
house
in
a
very
different
mood
did
they
return
running
skipping
and
jumping
they
burst
again
into
the
miss
young
oh
miss
young
we
are
to
have
a
holiday
mamma
sends
her
compliments
to
you
miss
young
and
she
hopes
you
will
give
us
a
holiday
it
is
a
fine
afternoon
she
thinks
and
my
cousins
have
never
gathered
cowslips
and
we
are
all
going
into
the
meadow
for
a
and
mr
hope
will
come
to
us
there
he
has
to
go
somewhere
now
but
he
will
come
to
us
before
we
have
half
done
matilda
rowland
looked
fall
of
dismay
till
she
was
told
that
mrs
grey
hoped
she
would
be
of
the
party
and
begged
that
she
would
go
directly
and
ask
her
mamma
leave
what
a
quantity
of
cowslips
we
shall
get
observed
mary
as
she
took
down
fanny
basket
from
the
nail
on
which
it
hung
and
then
her
own
we
are
each
to
have
a
basket
mamma
says
that
we
may
not
quarrel
what
shall
we
do
with
such
a
quantity
of
cowslips
make
tea
of
them
to
be
sure
replied
fanny
we
may
dry
them
in
this
window
may
not
we
miss
young
and
we
will
give
you
some
of
our
miss
young
smiled
and
thanked
them
she
did
not
promise
to
drink
any
of
the
promised
tea
she
had
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
of
her
young
days
when
the
picked
flowers
lay
in
a
window
till
they
were
laced
all
over
with
cobwebs
and
when
they
were
at
length
popped
into
the
teapot
with
all
speed
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
were
mouldy
she
remembered
the
attempts
of
her
father
and
mother
to
swallow
a
doll
cupful
of
her
rather
than
discourage
the
spirit
of
enterprise
which
now
that
she
had
lost
those
whom
she
loved
was
all
that
she
had
to
trust
to
fanny
said
mary
with
eyes
wide
open
can
not
we
have
a
feast
here
for
my
cousins
when
we
make
our
a
feast
oh
that
would
be
grand
replied
fanny
i
have
a
shilling
and
so
have
you
and
we
could
buy
a
good
many
nice
things
for
that
and
matilda
rowland
will
lend
us
her
doll
dishes
to
put
with
ours
miss
young
will
you
let
us
have
our
feast
here
one
afternoon
we
will
ask
my
cousins
without
telling
them
anything
and
they
will
be
so
surprised
miss
young
promised
everything
engaged
not
to
tell
smoothed
their
hair
tied
their
bonnets
and
sent
them
away
quite
happy
with
their
secret
such
a
holiday
as
this
was
one
of
miss
young
few
pleasures
there
were
several
occasions
in
the
year
when
she
could
make
sure
beforehand
of
some
hours
to
herself
her
sundays
were
much
occupied
with
the
and
with
intercourse
with
poor
neighbours
whom
she
could
not
meet
on
any
other
day
but
the
day
of
the
annual
fair
of
deerbrook
and
two
or
three
more
were
her
own
these
were
however
so
appropriated
long
before
to
some
object
that
they
lost
much
of
their
character
of
holidays
her
true
holidays
were
such
as
the
afternoon
of
this
day
hours
suddenly
set
free
little
gifts
of
leisure
to
be
spent
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
moment
let
none
pretend
to
understand
the
value
of
such
whose
lives
are
all
leisure
who
take
up
a
book
to
pass
the
time
who
saunter
in
gardens
because
there
are
no
morning
visits
to
make
who
exaggerate
the
writing
of
a
family
letter
into
important
business
such
have
their
own
enjoyments
but
they
know
nothing
of
the
paroxysm
of
pleasure
of
a
really
hardworking
person
on
hearing
the
door
shut
which
excludes
the
business
of
life
and
leaves
the
delight
of
free
thoughts
and
hands
the
worst
part
of
it
is
the
having
to
decide
how
to
make
the
most
of
liberty
miss
young
was
not
long
in
settling
this
point
she
just
glanced
up
at
her
shelf
of
books
and
down
upon
her
and
abroad
through
the
south
window
and
made
up
her
mind
the
acacia
with
its
fresh
bunches
of
blossoms
was
waving
above
the
window
casting
in
flickering
shadows
upon
the
floor
the
evergreens
of
the
shrubbery
twinkled
in
the
sun
as
the
light
breeze
swept
over
them
the
birds
were
chirruping
all
about
and
a
yellow
butterfly
alighted
and
trembled
on
the
at
the
moment
it
was
one
of
the
softest
and
gayest
days
of
spring
and
the
best
thing
was
to
do
nothing
but
enjoy
it
she
moved
to
the
south
window
with
her
work
and
sewed
or
let
the
wind
blow
upon
her
face
as
she
looked
out
the
landscape
was
a
wide
one
far
beyond
and
somewhat
below
the
garden
and
shrubberies
in
which
the
summerhouse
stood
flat
meadows
stretched
to
the
brink
of
the
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
were
the
park
woods
all
was
bathed
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
except
where
a
tree
here
and
there
cast
a
flake
of
shadow
upon
the
grass
of
the
meadows
it
is
a
luxury
thought
the
gazer
for
one
who
can
not
move
about
to
sit
here
and
look
abroad
i
wonder
whether
i
should
have
been
with
the
party
if
i
had
not
been
lame
i
dare
say
something
would
have
taken
off
from
the
pleasure
if
i
had
but
how
well
i
can
remember
what
the
pleasure
is
the
jumping
stiles
the
feel
of
the
turf
underfoot
the
running
after
every
flower
the
going
wherever
one
has
a
fancy
to
go
how
well
i
remember
it
all
and
yet
it
gives
me
a
sort
of
surprise
to
see
the
activity
of
these
children
and
how
little
they
are
aware
of
what
their
privilege
is
i
fancy
however
the
pleasure
is
more
in
the
recollection
of
all
such
natural
enjoyments
than
at
the
moment
it
is
so
with
me
and
i
believe
with
everybody
this
very
landscape
is
more
beautiful
to
me
in
the
dark
night
when
i
can
not
sleep
than
at
this
very
moment
when
it
looks
its
best
and
brightest
and
surely
this
is
the
great
difference
between
that
sort
of
pleasures
and
those
which
come
altogether
from
within
the
delight
of
a
happy
mood
of
mind
is
beyond
everything
at
the
time
it
sets
one
above
all
that
can
happen
it
steeps
one
in
heaven
itself
but
one
can
not
recall
it
one
can
only
remember
that
it
was
so
the
delight
of
being
in
such
a
place
as
those
woods
is
generally
more
or
less
spoiled
at
the
time
by
trifles
which
are
forgotten
afterwards
one
is
hungry
or
tired
or
a
little
vexed
with
somebody
or
doubtful
whether
somebody
else
is
not
vexed
but
then
the
remembrance
is
purely
delicious
brighter
in
sunshine
softer
in
shade
wholly
tempered
to
what
is
genial
the
imagination
is
a
better
medium
than
the
eye
this
is
surely
the
reason
why
byron
could
not
write
poetry
on
lake
leman
but
found
he
must
wait
till
he
got
within
four
walls
this
is
the
reason
why
we
are
all
more
moved
by
the
slightest
glimpses
of
good
descriptions
in
books
than
by
the
amplitude
of
the
same
objects
before
our
eyes
i
used
to
wonder
how
that
was
when
as
a
child
i
read
the
openings
of
scenes
and
books
in
lost
i
saw
plenty
of
summer
sunrises
but
none
of
them
gave
me
a
feeling
like
the
two
lines
morn
her
rosy
steps
in
the
eastern
clime
advancing
sowed
the
earth
with
orient
pearl
if
all
this
be
so
our
lot
is
more
equalised
than
is
commonly
thought
once
having
received
pictures
into
our
minds
and
possessing
a
clear
eye
in
the
mind
to
see
them
with
the
going
about
to
obtain
more
is
not
of
very
great
consequence
this
comforts
one
for
prisoners
suffering
and
for
townspeople
who
can
not
often
get
out
of
the
streets
and
for
lame
people
like
me
who
see
others
tripping
over
commons
and
through
fields
where
we
can
not
go
i
wish
there
was
as
much
comfort
the
other
way
about
such
as
suffer
from
unhappy
moods
of
mind
and
know
little
of
the
joy
of
the
highest
it
would
be
a
small
gain
to
them
to
fly
like
birds
to
see
like
the
eagle
oh
there
are
the
children
so
that
is
their
cowslip
meadow
how
like
children
they
all
look
together
down
on
the
grass
gathering
cowslips
i
suppose
the
two
in
black
are
more
eager
about
it
than
sophia
she
sits
on
the
stile
while
they
are
busy
the
children
are
holding
forth
to
their
cousins
teaching
them
something
evidently
how
i
love
to
overlook
people
to
watch
them
acting
unconsciously
and
speculate
for
them
it
is
the
most
tempting
thing
in
the
world
to
contrast
the
little
affairs
one
sees
them
busy
about
with
the
very
serious
ones
which
await
them
which
await
every
one
there
are
those
two
strangers
busy
gathering
cowslips
and
perhaps
thinking
of
nothing
beyond
the
fresh
pleasure
of
the
air
and
the
grass
and
the
scent
of
their
flowers
their
minds
quite
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
spring
when
who
knows
what
may
be
awaiting
them
love
may
be
just
at
hand
the
tempest
of
passion
may
be
brewing
under
this
soft
sunshine
they
think
themselves
now
as
full
of
happiness
as
possible
and
a
little
while
hence
upon
a
few
words
spoken
a
glance
exchanged
they
may
be
in
such
a
heaven
of
bliss
that
they
will
smile
at
their
own
ignorance
in
being
so
well
pleased
or
but
i
pray
they
may
escape
the
other
chance
neither
of
them
knows
anything
of
that
misery
yet
i
am
confident
they
both
look
too
young
too
open
too
free
to
have
really
i
wonder
whether
it
is
foolish
to
fancy
already
that
one
of
them
may
be
settled
here
it
can
hardly
be
foolish
when
the
thought
occurs
so
naturally
and
these
great
affairs
of
life
lie
distinctly
under
the
eye
of
such
as
are
themselves
cut
off
from
them
i
am
out
of
the
game
and
why
should
not
i
look
upon
its
chances
i
am
quite
alone
and
why
should
i
not
watch
for
others
every
situation
has
its
privileges
and
its
what
is
it
to
be
alone
and
to
be
let
alone
as
i
am
it
is
to
be
put
into
a
post
of
observation
on
others
but
the
knowledge
so
gained
is
anything
but
a
good
if
it
stops
at
mere
knowledge
if
it
does
not
make
me
feel
and
act
women
who
have
what
i
am
not
to
have
a
home
an
intimate
a
perpetual
call
out
of
themselves
may
go
on
more
safely
perhaps
without
any
thought
for
themselves
than
i
with
all
my
best
consideration
but
i
with
the
blessing
of
a
peremptory
vocation
which
is
to
stand
me
instead
of
sympathy
ties
and
spontaneous
action
i
may
find
out
that
it
is
my
proper
business
to
keep
an
intent
eye
upon
the
possible
events
of
other
people
lives
that
i
may
use
slight
occasions
of
action
which
might
otherwise
pass
me
by
if
one
were
thoroughly
wise
and
good
this
would
be
a
sort
of
divine
lot
without
being
at
all
wiser
or
better
than
others
being
even
as
weak
in
judgment
and
in
faith
as
i
am
something
may
be
made
of
it
without
daring
to
meddle
one
may
stand
ready
to
how
the
children
are
flying
over
the
meadow
towards
that
gentleman
who
is
fastening
his
horse
to
the
gate
mr
hope
no
doubt
he
is
the
oldest
cowslip
gatherer
of
them
all
i
fancy
if
one
could
overhear
the
talk
in
every
house
along
the
village
i
dare
say
some
of
it
is
about
mr
hope
winning
one
of
these
young
ladies
if
so
it
is
only
what
i
am
thinking
about
myself
every
one
wishes
to
see
mr
hope
married
every
one
even
to
the
servants
here
who
are
always
disputing
whether
he
will
not
have
miss
sophia
or
whether
miss
sophia
is
not
to
make
a
grander
match
sophia
will
not
do
for
him
but
it
is
very
possible
that
one
of
these
girls
may
and
the
other
but
i
will
not
think
about
that
how
yellow
the
glow
is
upon
those
woods
what
heavenly
hues
hang
about
the
world
we
live
in
but
how
strange
is
the
lot
of
some
in
it
one
would
wonder
why
when
all
are
so
plainly
made
to
feel
and
act
together
there
should
be
any
one
completely
solitary
there
must
be
a
reason
i
would
fain
know
it
but
i
can
wait
till
we
may
know
all
such
were
some
of
maria
young
natural
and
unchecked
thoughts
there
was
not
much
of
common
holiday
spirit
in
them
but
to
maria
liberty
and
peace
were
holiday
and
her
mind
was
not
otherwise
than
peaceful
she
was
serious
but
not
sad
any
one
who
could
at
the
moment
have
seen
her
face
would
have
pronounced
her
cheerful
at
heart
and
so
she
was
she
had
been
so
long
and
so
far
banished
from
ordinary
happiness
that
her
own
quiet
speculations
were
material
enough
for
cheerfulness
the
subject
on
which
she
would
not
think
was
the
possibility
of
one
of
the
sisters
attaching
mr
enderby
maria
young
had
not
always
been
solitary
and
lame
and
poor
her
father
had
not
been
very
long
dead
and
while
he
lived
no
one
supposed
that
his
only
child
would
be
poor
her
youth
passed
gaily
and
her
adversity
came
suddenly
her
father
was
wont
to
drive
her
out
in
his
gig
almost
every
summer
day
one
evening
the
horse
took
fright
and
upset
the
gig
on
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
mr
young
was
taken
up
dead
and
maria
was
lamed
for
life
she
had
always
known
the
enderbys
very
well
and
there
had
been
some
gossip
among
their
mutual
acquaintance
about
the
probability
that
philip
would
prove
to
be
maria
lover
when
he
should
be
old
enough
to
think
of
marrying
it
never
went
further
than
this
except
in
own
heart
she
had
indeed
hoped
even
supposed
that
in
philip
mind
the
affair
had
at
least
been
entertained
thus
far
she
could
never
settle
to
her
own
satisfaction
whether
she
had
been
weak
and
mistaken
or
whether
she
had
really
been
in
any
degree
wronged
there
had
been
words
there
had
been
looks
but
words
and
looks
are
so
easily
misinterpreted
the
probability
was
that
she
had
no
one
to
blame
but
herself
if
fault
there
was
perhaps
there
was
no
fault
anywhere
but
there
was
misery
intense
and
long
during
her
illness
no
tidings
came
of
philip
he
was
in
another
part
of
the
country
when
the
accident
happened
and
it
was
not
till
long
after
it
had
been
made
known
that
mr
young
had
died
insolvent
not
till
after
maria
had
recovered
as
far
as
recovery
was
possible
not
till
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
earning
her
bread
that
philip
reappeared
and
shook
hands
with
her
and
told
her
with
how
much
concern
he
had
heard
of
her
sufferings
this
interview
gave
her
entire
possession
of
herself
so
she
believed
she
got
through
it
calmly
and
it
left
her
with
one
subject
at
least
of
intense
thankfulness
that
her
mind
was
known
only
to
herself
whatever
might
be
her
solitary
struggles
she
might
look
without
shame
into
the
face
of
every
human
being
she
could
bear
being
pitied
for
her
poverty
for
her
lameness
for
her
change
of
prospects
when
the
recollection
of
this
came
across
any
of
her
acquaintance
if
it
had
been
necessary
she
could
probably
have
borne
to
be
pitied
for
having
loved
without
return
but
she
could
not
be
too
thankful
that
it
was
not
necessary
maria
was
right
in
her
supposition
that
the
village
was
speculating
upon
the
young
ladies
the
parish
clerk
had
for
some
years
indeed
ever
since
the
death
of
the
late
stationer
and
dispenser
of
letters
carried
on
a
flirtation
with
the
widow
notwithstanding
the
rumours
which
were
current
as
to
the
cause
to
which
her
late
husband
owed
his
death
it
was
believed
that
poor
harry
plumstead
died
of
exhaustion
from
his
wife
voice
for
she
was
no
other
than
the
village
scold
of
whose
existence
margaret
had
been
warned
by
mr
enderby
some
thought
that
owen
was
acting
a
politic
part
in
protracting
this
flirtation
keeping
her
temper
in
check
by
his
hold
upon
her
expectations
and
such
had
little
doubt
that
the
affair
would
linger
on
to
the
end
without
any
other
result
than
owen
exemption
meanwhile
from
the
inflictions
of
her
tongue
to
which
in
the
discharge
of
his
office
he
might
otherwise
become
frequently
liable
others
wished
to
see
them
married
believing
that
in
owen
a
welshman
sufficiently
irascible
mrs
plumstead
would
at
last
meet
her
match
this
afternoon
an
observer
would
have
thought
the
affair
was
proceeding
to
this
point
mrs
plumstead
looking
particularly
comely
and
gracious
was
putting
up
an
unclaimed
letter
at
the
window
for
display
when
owen
stopped
to
ask
if
she
had
seen
the
pretty
young
ladies
who
had
come
to
deerbrook
he
remarked
that
to
be
sure
they
might
have
gone
to
some
place
where
they
were
more
wanted
for
deerbrook
was
not
without
pretty
faces
of
its
own
before
and
as
he
said
so
he
smiled
hard
in
the
widow
face
he
should
not
wonder
if
some
work
for
the
rector
should
rise
up
before
long
for
where
there
were
pretty
faces
weddings
might
be
looked
for
he
even
asked
mrs
plumstead
if
she
did
not
think
so
and
added
something
so
ambiguous
about
his
own
share
in
the
work
for
the
rector
which
was
to
arise
that
the
widow
could
not
make
out
whether
he
spoke
as
her
admirer
or
as
parish
clerk
in
the
milliner
workroom
there
was
a
spirited
conversation
between
miss
nares
and
her
assistant
on
the
past
wedding
dresses
of
deerbrook
arising
out
of
the
topic
of
the
day
the
miss
ibbotsons
mrs
howell
who
with
her
shopwoman
miss
miskin
dispensed
the
haberdashery
of
the
place
smiled
winningly
at
every
customer
who
entered
her
shop
and
talked
of
delightful
acquisitions
and
what
must
be
felt
about
mr
hope
in
the
midst
of
such
charming
society
and
what
it
must
be
hoped
would
be
felt
and
how
gay
the
place
was
likely
to
be
with
riding
parties
and
boating
parties
and
some
said
dances
on
the
green
at
mrs
enderby
and
how
partners
in
a
dance
have
been
known
to
become
partners
for
life
as
she
had
been
jocosely
told
when
her
poor
dear
howell
prevailed
on
her
to
stand
up
with
him
the
first
time
for
twenty
years
at
his
niece
wedding
hester
beauty
and
what
mrs
grey
had
said
about
it
to
her
maid
were
discussed
just
at
the
moment
when
hester
passing
the
shop
was
entreated
by
sophia
to
look
at
a
new
pattern
of
embroidery
which
had
lately
arrived
from
london
and
was
suspended
at
the
window
mrs
howell
and
her
gossips
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
of
the
young
lady
through
the
drapery
of
prints
and
muslins
and
the
festoons
of
ribbons
and
when
the
party
proceeded
down
the
street
there
was
a
rush
to
the
door
in
order
to
obtain
a
view
of
her
figure
she
was
pronounced
beautiful
and
it
was
hoped
that
some
gentleman
in
the
village
would
find
her
irresistible
it
was
only
rather
strange
that
no
gentleman
was
in
attendance
on
her
now
if
the
gossips
could
have
followed
the
party
with
their
eyes
into
the
meadow
they
would
soon
have
been
satisfied
for
it
was
not
long
before
mr
hope
joined
them
there
on
leaving
mr
grey
table
he
was
as
little
disposed
to
go
and
visit
his
patient
as
medical
men
are
when
they
are
called
away
from
the
merriest
company
or
at
the
most
interesting
moment
of
a
conversation
the
liability
to
this
kind
of
interruption
is
one
of
the
great
drawbacks
of
the
profession
to
which
mr
hope
belonged
another
is
the
impossibility
of
travelling
the
being
fixed
to
one
place
for
life
without
any
but
the
shortest
intervals
of
journeying
mr
hope
had
been
settled
for
five
years
at
deerbrook
and
during
that
time
he
had
scarcely
been
out
of
sight
of
its
steeple
his
own
active
and
gladsome
mind
had
kept
him
happy
among
his
occupations
there
was
no
one
in
the
place
with
whom
he
could
hold
equal
converse
but
while
he
had
it
not
he
did
not
feel
the
pressing
want
of
it
he
loved
his
profession
and
it
kept
him
busy
his
kind
heart
was
ever
full
of
interest
for
his
poorer
patients
seeing
the
best
side
of
everybody
he
could
be
entertained
though
sometimes
vexed
by
his
intercourse
with
the
greys
and
rowlands
then
there
was
the
and
gentlemanly
rector
and
philip
enderby
often
came
down
for
a
few
weeks
and
mr
hope
had
the
chief
management
of
the
book
society
and
could
thus
see
the
best
new
books
and
his
professional
rides
lay
through
a
remarkably
pretty
country
he
kept
up
a
punctual
and
copious
correspondence
with
the
members
of
his
own
family
with
his
married
sisters
and
with
his
only
brother
now
with
his
regiment
in
india
relating
to
them
every
important
circumstance
of
his
lot
and
almost
every
interesting
feeling
of
his
heart
with
this
variety
of
resources
life
had
passed
away
cheerily
on
the
whole
with
mr
hope
for
the
five
years
of
his
residence
at
deerbrook
though
there
were
times
when
he
wondered
whether
it
was
to
be
always
thus
whether
he
was
to
pass
to
his
grave
without
any
higher
or
deeper
human
intercourses
than
he
had
here
if
it
had
been
possible
he
might
like
other
men
as
wise
as
himself
have
invested
some
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
deerbrook
with
imaginary
attributes
and
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
creature
of
his
own
fancy
but
it
really
was
not
possible
there
was
no
one
of
the
young
ladies
of
deerbrook
who
was
not
so
far
inferior
to
the
women
of
hope
own
family
to
the
mother
he
had
lost
and
the
sisters
who
were
settled
far
away
as
to
render
this
commonest
of
all
delusions
impossible
to
him
to
such
a
man
so
circumstanced
it
may
be
imagined
how
great
an
event
was
the
meeting
with
hester
and
margaret
he
could
not
be
in
their
presence
ten
minutes
without
becoming
aware
of
their
superiority
to
every
woman
he
had
seen
for
five
years
past
the
beauty
of
the
one
the
sincerity
and
unconsciousness
of
the
other
and
the
general
elevation
of
both
struck
him
forcibly
the
first
evening
his
earliest
thought
the
next
morning
was
of
some
great
event
having
taken
place
and
when
he
left
mr
grey
door
after
dinner
it
was
with
an
unwillingness
which
made
him
spur
himself
and
his
horse
on
to
their
business
that
he
might
the
sooner
return
to
his
pleasure
his
thoughts
already
darted
forward
to
the
time
when
the
miss
ibbotsons
would
be
leaving
deerbrook
it
was
already
a
heavy
thought
how
dull
deerbrook
would
be
without
them
he
was
already
unconsciously
looking
at
every
object
in
and
around
the
familiar
place
with
the
eyes
of
the
strangers
speculating
on
how
the
whole
would
appear
to
them
in
short
his
mind
was
full
of
them
there
are
perhaps
none
who
do
not
know
what
this
kind
of
impression
is
all
have
felt
it
at
some
time
or
other
many
have
felt
it
often
about
strangers
whom
they
have
been
predisposed
to
like
or
with
whom
they
have
been
struck
at
meeting
nine
times
out
of
ten
perhaps
the
impression
is
fleeting
and
when
it
is
gone
there
is
an
unwillingness
to
return
to
it
from
a
sense
of
absurdity
in
having
been
so
much
interested
about
one
who
so
soon
became
indifferent
but
the
fact
is
not
the
less
real
and
general
for
this
when
it
happens
between
two
young
people
who
are
previously
and
circumstances
favour
the
impression
till
it
sinks
deeper
than
the
fancy
it
takes
the
name
of
love
at
first
sight
otherwise
it
passes
away
without
a
name
without
a
record
for
the
hour
it
is
a
secret
in
an
after
time
it
is
forgotten
possessed
unconsciously
with
this
secret
hope
threw
himself
from
his
horse
at
the
entrance
of
the
meadow
where
the
were
busy
fastened
his
steed
to
the
gate
and
joined
the
party
the
children
ran
to
him
with
the
gleanings
of
intelligence
which
they
had
acquired
since
he
saw
them
last
half
an
hour
before
that
it
was
well
they
did
not
put
off
their
gathering
any
longer
for
some
of
the
flowers
were
beginning
to
dry
up
already
that
cousins
had
never
tasted
was
not
this
odd
that
cousin
hester
would
not
help
to
pick
the
flowers
for
drying
she
thought
it
such
a
pity
to
pull
the
blossom
out
of
the
calyx
that
sophia
would
not
help
either
because
it
was
warm
that
cousin
margaret
had
gathered
a
great
many
but
she
had
been
ever
so
long
watching
a
spider
nest
a
nasty
large
spider
nest
that
matilda
was
just
going
to
break
into
when
cousin
margaret
asked
her
not
to
spoil
it
margaret
was
indeed
on
her
knees
prying
into
the
spider
nest
when
duly
laughed
at
she
owned
to
having
seen
cobwebs
before
but
maintained
that
cobwebs
in
a
closet
were
a
very
different
affair
from
a
nest
in
a
field
i
rather
think
however
said
she
the
word
itself
has
something
to
do
with
my
liking
for
what
i
have
been
looking
at
some
of
your
commonest
country
words
have
a
charm
to
the
ear
and
imagination
of
townspeople
that
you
could
not
understand
but
said
mr
hope
i
thought
nests
were
very
common
in
birmingham
have
you
not
nests
of
boxes
and
nests
of
yes
and
so
we
have
stacks
of
chimneys
but
yet
we
do
not
think
of
when
we
see
the
smoke
of
the
i
rather
think
country
words
are
only
captivating
as
relating
to
the
country
but
then
you
can
not
think
how
bewitching
they
are
to
people
who
live
in
streets
the
children
might
have
found
you
a
prettier
sort
of
nest
to
indulge
your
fancy
with
i
should
think
there
must
be
plenty
of
creatures
besides
spiders
in
this
wide
meadow
mr
hope
called
out
to
the
little
girls
that
whoever
should
find
any
sort
of
a
nest
in
the
meadow
for
miss
margaret
ibbotson
should
have
a
ride
on
his
horse
away
flew
the
children
and
hester
and
sophia
came
from
the
to
know
what
all
the
bustle
was
about
fanny
returned
to
inquire
whether
the
nests
must
be
the
meadow
whether
just
outside
would
not
do
she
knew
there
was
an
ants
nest
in
the
bank
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
the
decision
was
that
the
ants
nest
would
do
only
in
case
of
her
not
being
able
to
find
any
other
within
bounds
sophia
looked
on
languidly
probably
thinking
all
this
very
silly
it
put
her
in
mind
of
an
old
schoolfellow
of
hers
who
had
been
called
very
clever
before
she
came
to
school
at
nine
years
old
till
she
saw
her
sophia
had
believed
that
town
children
were
always
clever
but
no
later
than
the
very
first
day
this
little
girl
had
got
into
disgrace
with
the
governess
her
task
was
to
learn
by
heart
goldsmith
country
clergyman
in
the
village
she
said
it
quite
perfectly
but
when
questioned
about
the
meaning
stopped
short
at
the
first
line
near
yonder
copse
where
once
a
garden
smiled
she
persisted
that
she
did
not
know
what
a
copse
was
the
governess
said
she
was
obstinate
and
shut
her
up
in
the
play
hours
between
morning
and
afternoon
school
sophia
never
could
make
out
whether
the
girl
was
foolish
or
obstinate
in
persisting
that
she
did
not
know
what
a
copse
was
but
her
cousin
margaret
now
put
her
in
mind
of
this
girl
with
all
her
town
feelings
and
her
fuss
about
spiders
nests
how
is
old
mr
smithson
sophia
inquired
of
mr
hope
by
way
of
introducing
something
more
rational
not
better
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
he
should
be
was
the
reply
papa
thought
last
night
he
must
be
dying
he
is
dying
have
you
just
come
from
a
patient
who
is
dying
asked
hester
with
a
look
of
anxiety
with
which
was
mixed
some
surprise
yes
from
one
who
can
not
live
many
days
sophia
observed
that
mr
james
had
been
sent
for
early
this
morning
no
doubt
to
put
the
finish
to
the
will
but
nobody
seemed
to
know
whether
the
old
gentleman
would
leave
his
money
to
his
nephew
or
his
or
whether
he
would
divide
it
between
them
hester
and
margaret
showed
no
anxiety
on
this
point
but
seemed
so
ready
to
be
interested
about
some
others
as
to
make
mr
hope
think
that
they
were
only
restrained
by
delicacy
from
asking
all
that
he
could
tell
about
his
patient
state
they
knew
enough
of
the
profession
however
to
be
aware
that
this
kind
of
inquiry
is
the
last
which
should
be
addressed
to
a
medical
man
you
are
surprised
said
he
that
i
am
come
from
a
dying
patient
to
play
with
the
children
in
the
fields
come
acknowledge
that
this
is
in
your
minds
if
it
is
it
is
an
unreasonable
thought
said
margaret
you
must
see
so
many
dying
people
it
would
be
hard
that
in
every
case
you
should
be
put
out
of
the
reach
of
pleasure
never
mind
the
hardship
if
it
be
fitting
said
hope
hard
or
not
hard
is
it
natural
is
it
possible
i
suppose
witnessing
death
so
often
does
lessen
the
feelings
about
it
observed
hester
yet
i
can
not
fancy
that
one
mind
could
be
at
liberty
for
small
concerns
immediately
after
leaving
a
house
full
of
mourners
and
the
sight
of
one
in
pain
there
must
be
something
distasteful
in
everything
that
meets
one
eyes
in
the
sunshine
itself
true
that
is
the
feeling
in
such
cases
but
such
cases
seldom
occur
yes
i
mean
what
i
say
such
cases
are
very
rare
the
dying
person
is
commonly
old
or
so
worn
out
by
illness
as
to
make
death
at
last
no
evil
when
the
illness
is
shorter
it
is
usually
found
that
a
few
hours
in
the
sick
room
do
the
work
of
months
of
common
life
in
reconciling
the
minds
of
survivors
i
am
sure
that
is
true
observed
margaret
it
is
so
generally
the
case
that
i
know
no
set
of
circumstances
in
which
i
should
more
confidently
reckon
on
the
calmness
forethought
and
composure
of
the
persons
i
have
to
deal
with
than
in
the
family
of
a
dying
person
the
news
comes
suddenly
to
the
neighbours
all
the
circumstances
rush
at
once
into
their
imaginations
all
their
recollections
and
feelings
about
the
sufferer
agitate
them
in
quick
succession
and
they
naturally
suppose
the
near
friends
must
be
more
agitated
in
proportion
to
their
nearness
the
watchers
meanwhile
said
hester
have
had
time
in
the
long
night
to
go
over
the
past
and
the
future
again
and
again
and
by
morning
all
seems
so
familiar
that
they
think
they
can
never
be
surprised
into
grief
again
so
familiar
said
mr
hope
that
their
minds
are
at
liberty
for
the
smallest
particulars
of
their
duty
i
usually
find
them
ready
for
the
minutest
directions
i
may
have
to
give
yes
the
time
for
surprise
for
consternation
is
long
afterwards
said
hester
with
some
emotion
when
the
whole
has
become
settled
and
finished
in
other
minds
the
nearest
mourners
begin
to
wake
up
to
their
mourning
and
thus
said
margaret
the
strongest
agitation
is
happily
not
witnessed
happily
not
said
mr
hope
i
doubt
whether
anybody
strongest
agitations
ever
are
witnessed
i
doubt
whether
the
sufferer
himself
is
often
aware
of
what
are
really
his
greatest
sufferings
and
he
is
so
ashamed
of
them
that
he
hides
them
from
himself
when
it
is
possible
i
can
not
but
think
that
any
grief
which
reveals
itself
is
very
endurable
is
not
that
rather
hard
asked
margaret
how
does
it
seem
to
you
hard
is
it
not
merciful
that
we
can
keep
our
worst
sorrows
that
we
are
disposed
as
it
were
forced
to
keep
them
from
afflicting
our
friends
but
is
it
not
saying
that
bereavement
of
friends
is
not
the
greatest
of
sorrows
while
all
seem
to
agree
that
it
is
is
it
generally
speaking
the
greatest
of
sorrows
i
think
not
for
my
own
part
there
are
cases
in
which
the
loss
is
too
heavy
to
bear
being
the
subject
of
any
speculation
almost
of
observation
for
instance
when
the
happiest
married
people
are
separated
or
when
a
first
or
only
child
dies
but
i
think
there
are
many
sorrows
greater
than
a
separation
by
death
of
those
who
have
faith
enough
to
live
independently
of
each
other
and
mutual
love
enough
to
deserve
as
they
hope
to
meet
again
hereafter
i
assure
you
i
have
sometimes
come
away
from
houses
unvisited
and
unlikely
to
be
visited
by
death
with
a
heart
so
heavy
as
i
have
rarely
or
never
brought
from
a
deathbed
i
should
have
thought
that
would
be
left
for
the
rector
to
say
observed
hester
i
should
have
supposed
you
meant
cases
of
guilt
or
remorse
cases
of
guilt
or
remorse
continued
mr
hope
and
also
of
infirmity
people
may
say
what
they
will
but
i
am
persuaded
that
there
is
immeasurably
more
suffering
endured
both
in
paroxysms
and
for
a
continuance
from
infirmity
tendency
to
a
particular
fault
or
the
privation
of
a
sense
than
from
the
loss
of
any
friend
upon
earth
except
the
very
nearest
and
dearest
and
even
that
case
is
no
exception
when
there
is
the
faith
of
meeting
again
which
almost
every
mourner
has
so
natural
and
welcome
as
it
is
do
you
tell
your
infirm
friends
the
high
opinion
you
have
of
their
sufferings
asked
margaret
why
not
exactly
that
would
not
be
the
kindest
thing
to
do
would
it
what
they
want
is
to
have
their
trouble
lightened
to
them
not
made
the
worst
of
lightened
not
by
using
any
deceit
of
course
but
by
simply
treating
their
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
then
surely
you
should
make
light
of
the
case
of
the
dying
too
make
light
of
it
even
to
the
survivors
do
you
do
this
in
one
sense
i
do
in
another
sense
no
one
can
do
it
not
regarding
death
as
a
misfortune
i
can
not
affect
to
consider
it
so
regarding
the
change
of
existence
as
a
very
serious
one
i
can
not
of
course
make
light
of
it
that
way
of
looking
at
it
regards
only
the
dying
person
you
have
not
said
how
you
speak
of
it
to
survivors
as
i
speak
of
it
to
you
now
or
to
myself
when
i
see
any
one
die
with
the
added
consideration
of
what
the
survivors
are
about
to
lose
that
is
a
large
consideration
certainly
but
should
not
one
give
them
credit
for
viewing
death
as
it
is
and
for
being
willing
to
bear
their
own
loss
cheerfully
as
they
would
desire
to
bear
any
other
kind
of
loss
especially
if
as
they
say
they
believe
it
to
be
only
for
a
time
this
as
looking
on
the
bright
side
observed
hester
in
a
low
voice
but
she
was
overheard
by
mr
hope
i
trust
you
do
not
object
to
the
bright
side
of
things
said
he
smiling
as
long
as
there
is
so
much
about
us
that
is
really
very
dark
what
can
religion
be
for
said
margaret
or
reason
or
philosophy
whichever
name
you
may
call
your
faith
by
but
to
show
us
the
bright
side
of
everything
of
death
among
the
rest
i
have
often
wondered
why
we
seem
to
try
to
make
the
most
of
that
evil
if
evil
it
be
while
we
think
it
a
duty
to
make
the
least
of
every
other
i
had
some
such
feeling
i
suppose
when
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
you
had
come
hither
straight
from
a
deathbed
i
do
not
wonder
at
all
now
mr
smithson
will
not
be
much
missed
observed
sophia
who
felt
herself
relieved
from
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
by
what
had
passed
and
at
liberty
to
speak
of
him
as
freely
as
if
he
was
no
nearer
death
than
ever
he
has
never
been
a
sociable
neighbour
i
always
thought
him
an
odd
old
man
from
the
earliest
time
i
can
remember
some
few
will
miss
him
said
mr
hope
he
is
a
shy
man
who
never
did
himself
justice
except
with
two
or
three
who
saw
most
of
him
their
affection
has
been
enough
for
him
enough
to
make
him
think
now
that
his
life
has
been
a
very
happy
one
there
cried
hope
as
a
lark
sprang
up
almost
from
under
the
feet
of
the
party
there
is
another
member
of
deerbrook
society
ladies
who
is
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
there
were
two
or
three
larks
hovering
above
the
meadow
at
this
moment
and
others
were
soaring
further
off
the
air
was
full
of
lark
music
the
party
stood
still
and
listened
looking
up
into
the
sunny
sky
they
watched
one
little
warbler
wheeling
round
falling
rising
again
still
warbling
till
it
seemed
as
if
it
could
never
be
exhausted
sophia
said
it
made
her
head
ache
to
look
up
so
long
and
she
seemed
impatient
for
the
bird
to
have
done
it
then
struck
her
that
she
also
might
find
a
nest
like
her
sisters
and
she
examined
the
place
whence
the
lark
had
sprung
under
a
thick
tuft
of
grass
in
a
little
hollow
she
found
a
family
of
infant
larks
huddled
together
and
pointed
them
out
to
her
cousins
the
children
came
upon
being
called
they
were
damped
in
spirits
they
did
not
see
how
they
were
to
find
any
nests
if
the
ants
nest
would
not
do
unless
indeed
mr
hope
would
hold
them
up
into
the
trees
or
hedges
to
look
but
they
could
not
climb
trees
mr
hope
knew
they
were
somewhat
further
mortified
by
perceiving
that
they
might
have
found
a
nest
by
examining
the
ground
if
they
had
happened
to
think
of
it
margaret
begged
they
would
not
be
distressed
at
not
finding
nests
for
her
and
mr
hope
proposed
to
try
his
luck
saying
that
if
he
succeeded
every
one
who
wished
should
have
a
ride
on
his
horse
to
the
surprise
of
the
children
he
turned
towards
the
water
and
walked
along
the
bank
the
brimming
river
was
smooth
as
glass
and
where
it
stood
in
among
the
rushes
and
in
every
tiny
inlet
it
was
as
clear
as
the
air
and
alive
with
small
fish
which
darted
at
the
flies
that
dimpled
the
surface
a
swan
which
had
been
quietly
sailing
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
changed
its
deportment
as
the
party
proceeded
along
the
bank
it
ruffled
its
breast
feathers
arched
back
its
neck
till
the
head
rested
between
the
erect
wings
and
drove
through
the
water
with
a
speed
which
shivered
the
pictures
in
it
as
a
sweeping
gale
would
have
done
what
is
the
matter
with
the
creature
asked
margaret
i
never
saw
a
swan
behave
so
the
children
seemed
rather
afraid
that
the
bird
would
come
on
shore
and
attack
them
mr
hope
took
the
opportunity
of
its
being
at
some
little
distance
to
open
the
rushes
and
show
where
a
fine
egg
lay
in
a
large
round
nest
oh
mr
hope
you
knew
cried
the
children
you
knew
there
was
a
swan
nest
near
yes
and
did
not
you
when
you
saw
how
the
swan
behaved
but
i
was
aware
of
this
nest
before
tom
creach
has
the
care
of
the
park
swans
he
made
this
nest
and
he
told
me
where
it
was
let
your
cousins
have
a
peep
and
then
we
will
go
before
the
poor
swan
grows
too
much
frightened
and
now
who
will
have
a
ride
on
my
horse
all
the
children
chose
to
ride
and
while
mr
hope
was
coursing
with
them
in
turn
round
and
round
the
meadow
the
young
ladies
proceeded
along
the
bank
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
on
they
fell
in
with
sydney
grey
and
his
friend
mr
philip
they
had
been
successful
in
their
sport
mr
enderby
had
had
enough
of
it
and
was
stretched
on
the
grass
reading
while
sydney
stood
on
the
roots
of
an
old
oak
casting
his
line
into
the
pool
beneath
its
shadow
so
here
you
are
quite
safe
said
sophia
george
rowland
might
have
come
after
all
poor
boy
i
am
glad
he
is
not
with
us
he
would
be
so
mortified
to
see
all
the
fish
you
have
caught
without
him
how
many
times
have
we
been
in
the
river
sydney
can
you
remember
asked
mr
enderby
i
have
seen
no
fish
big
enough
to
pull
us
in
said
sydney
and
i
do
not
know
any
other
way
of
getting
a
wetting
at
this
sport
mrs
rowland
should
have
seen
george
and
me
climbing
the
old
oak
at
the
turning
i
dared
george
to
it
and
there
he
hung
over
the
water
at
the
end
of
the
branch
riding
up
and
down
like
a
she
would
think
nothing
of
letting
him
go
fishing
after
that
if
the
branch
had
broken
said
mr
enderby
what
would
you
have
done
then
oh
it
is
not
often
that
a
branch
breaks
old
oaks
are
apt
to
break
sooner
or
later
and
the
next
time
you
dare
george
to
over
the
river
i
would
advise
you
to
consider
beforehand
how
you
would
get
him
out
in
case
of
his
dropping
in
oh
he
is
not
afraid
one
day
lately
when
the
water
was
low
he
offered
to
cross
the
weir
at
dingleford
i
did
not
persuade
him
to
that
but
he
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
got
over
and
back
safe
enough
indeed
and
you
tried
it
too
i
suppose
yes
it
would
be
a
shame
if
i
could
not
do
what
george
can
it
was
almost
as
easy
as
walking
along
this
bank
i
shall
talk
to
master
george
however
before
he
goes
to
dingleford
again
or
he
may
chance
to
find
it
easier
some
day
to
miss
his
footing
than
to
hold
it
i
wonder
mrs
rowland
is
afraid
to
let
george
go
out
with
you
said
sophia
considering
what
things
he
does
when
you
are
not
with
him
she
does
not
know
of
these
pranks
or
she
would
feel
as
you
do
and
i
hope
every
one
here
will
be
kind
enough
not
to
tell
her
it
would
only
be
making
her
anxious
to
no
purpose
whenever
the
boy
is
out
of
her
sight
it
would
be
a
pity
to
make
a
coward
of
him
and
i
think
i
can
teach
him
what
is
mischief
and
what
is
not
without
disturbing
her
come
ladies
suppose
you
rest
yourselves
here
you
will
find
a
pleasant
seat
on
this
bank
at
least
i
fell
asleep
on
it
just
now
as
if
i
had
been
on
a
sofa
i
wish
you
would
all
go
to
sleep
or
else
walk
off
said
sydney
you
make
so
much
noise
i
shall
never
catch
any
fish
suppose
you
were
to
go
somewhere
else
said
mr
enderby
would
not
that
be
rather
more
civil
than
sending
us
all
away
sydney
thought
he
would
find
another
place
there
were
plenty
along
the
bank
he
gathered
up
bait
and
basket
and
trudged
off
there
was
an
amusement
however
which
he
liked
better
even
than
fishing
and
for
which
he
now
surrendered
it
he
was
presently
seen
cantering
round
the
meadow
on
mr
hope
horse
mr
enderby
hoped
the
miss
ibbotsons
were
able
to
say
no
with
decision
if
not
he
did
not
envy
them
their
supper
this
evening
for
sydney
would
certainly
ask
them
to
eat
all
the
fish
he
had
caught
bream
and
dace
and
all
the
first
pleasure
of
young
anglers
is
to
catch
these
small
fry
and
the
next
is
to
make
their
sisters
and
cousins
eat
them
sophia
solemnly
assured
her
cousins
that
mamma
never
allowed
fish
to
come
to
table
at
least
in
the
house
if
the
children
liked
to
get
the
cook
to
boil
them
for
their
dolls
feasts
in
the
schoolroom
they
might
and
then
miss
young
is
favoured
with
a
share
i
suppose
said
margaret
have
you
made
acquaintance
with
miss
young
yet
inquired
mr
enderby
oh
yes
i
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
miss
young
long
before
i
knew
you
long
how
long
i
was
not
aware
that
you
had
ever
met
where
did
you
meet
in
the
schoolroom
before
breakfast
full
four
hours
before
you
called
this
morning
oh
that
is
all
you
mean
i
wondered
how
you
should
know
her
sophia
asked
whether
margaret
and
miss
young
were
not
going
to
study
together
margaret
assented
miss
young
was
kind
enough
to
promise
to
help
her
to
read
german
and
you
said
mr
enderby
to
hester
why
no
i
am
rather
afraid
of
the
undertaking
and
you
miss
grey
no
mamma
says
i
have
enough
to
do
with
my
history
and
my
music
especially
while
my
cousins
are
here
i
began
german
once
but
mamma
thought
i
was
growing
awry
and
so
i
left
it
off
i
find
mrs
rowland
means
matilda
to
learn
german
we
are
all
disposed
to
have
my
little
nieces
learn
whatever
miss
young
will
be
kind
enough
to
teach
them
they
will
gain
nothing
but
good
from
her
she
is
very
learned
to
be
sure
observed
sophia
and
something
more
than
learned
i
should
think
said
hester
i
fancy
she
is
wise
how
can
you
have
discovered
that
already
asked
mr
enderby
whose
fingers
were
busy
dissecting
a
stalk
of
flowering
grass
i
hardly
know
i
have
nothing
to
quote
for
my
opinion
her
conversation
leaves
a
general
impression
of
her
being
very
sensible
sensible
as
she
is
a
woman
observed
margaret
if
she
were
a
man
she
would
be
called
philosophical
she
very
superior
observed
sophia
it
was
mamma
doing
that
she
is
the
children
governess
philosophical
repeated
mr
enderby
it
is
a
happy
thing
that
she
is
philosophical
in
her
circumstances
poor
thing
as
she
happens
to
be
unprosperous
said
margaret
smiling
if
she
were
rich
and
strong
and
admired
her
philosophy
would
be
laughed
at
it
would
only
be
in
the
way
mr
enderby
sighed
and
made
no
answer
before
any
one
spoke
again
mr
hope
and
his
little
companions
came
up
how
quiet
you
all
are
exclaimed
sydney
i
a
good
mind
to
come
and
fish
here
again
if
you
will
only
go
on
to
be
so
drowsy
sophia
declared
that
they
had
been
talking
up
to
the
last
minute
about
miss
young
and
learning
german
and
being
philosophical
and
which
of
the
party
have
you
made
out
to
be
the
most
philosophical
inquired
mr
hope
we
have
not
so
much
as
made
out
what
philosophy
is
for
said
hester
can
you
tell
us
as
she
looked
up
at
mr
hope
who
was
standing
behind
her
sydney
thought
her
question
was
addressed
to
him
swinging
his
round
he
replied
doubtfully
that
he
thought
philosophy
was
good
to
know
how
to
do
things
what
sort
of
things
why
to
make
phosphorus
lights
and
electrify
people
as
dr
levitt
did
when
he
made
sophia
jump
off
the
stool
with
glass
legs
sophia
was
sure
that
any
one
else
would
have
jumped
off
the
stool
as
she
did
she
should
take
good
care
never
to
jump
on
it
again
but
she
wondered
sydney
did
not
know
any
better
than
that
what
philosophy
was
for
her
cousins
said
miss
young
was
philosophical
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
phosphorus
or
electrical
machines
mr
enderby
explained
to
mr
hope
that
he
had
said
what
he
was
ready
to
maintain
that
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
any
one
who
like
miss
young
was
not
so
prosperous
as
she
had
been
to
be
supported
by
philosophy
and
granting
this
said
margaret
it
was
next
inquired
whether
this
same
philosophy
would
have
been
considered
equally
admirable
equally
a
matter
of
congratulation
if
miss
young
had
not
wanted
it
for
solace
a
question
as
old
as
the
brigg
at
stirling
replied
mr
hope
older
older
than
any
bridges
of
man
making
why
stirling
brigg
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
do
not
you
know
the
story
that
an
old
woman
wanted
to
cross
the
forth
and
some
ferrymen
would
have
persuaded
her
to
go
in
their
boat
when
she
was
confident
that
a
tempest
was
coming
on
which
would
have
made
the
ferry
unsafe
they
told
her
at
last
that
she
must
trust
to
providence
na
said
she
will
trust
to
providence
while
there
is
a
brigg
at
stirling
the
common
practice
is
you
know
with
the
old
we
will
not
trust
to
the
highest
support
we
profess
to
have
till
nothing
else
is
left
us
we
worship
philosophy
but
never
think
of
making
use
of
it
while
we
have
prosperity
as
well
the
question
is
whether
such
practice
is
wise
said
margaret
we
all
know
it
is
common
for
my
part
said
mr
enderby
i
think
the
old
scotchwoman
was
right
providence
helps
those
that
help
themselves
and
takes
care
of
those
who
take
care
of
themselves
just
so
said
hope
her
error
was
in
supposing
that
the
one
course
was
an
alternative
from
the
other
that
she
would
not
be
trusting
in
providence
as
much
in
going
by
the
bridge
as
in
braving
the
tempest
i
think
we
are
in
the
same
error
when
we
set
up
philosophy
and
prosperity
in
opposition
to
each
other
taking
up
with
the
one
when
we
can
not
get
the
other
as
if
philosophy
were
not
over
all
compassing
our
life
as
the
blue
sky
overarches
the
earth
brightening
vivifying
harmonising
all
whether
we
look
up
to
see
whence
the
light
comes
or
not
you
think
it
a
mistake
then
said
margaret
not
to
look
up
to
it
till
all
is
night
below
and
there
is
no
light
to
be
seen
but
by
gazing
overhead
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
miss
seeing
the
white
clouds
and
blue
depths
at
noon
because
we
may
reckon
upon
moon
and
stars
at
midnight
then
again
what
is
life
at
its
best
without
philosophy
i
can
tell
you
as
well
as
anybody
said
mr
enderby
for
i
never
had
any
philosophy
no
neither
wisdom
nor
the
love
of
wisdom
nor
patience
nor
any
of
the
things
that
philosophy
is
understood
to
mean
oh
mr
enderby
cried
sydney
what
pains
you
took
to
teach
me
to
fish
and
to
make
me
wait
patiently
for
a
bite
say
you
are
not
patient
my
account
of
life
without
philosophy
said
mr
enderby
proceeding
as
if
he
did
not
hear
the
children
testifying
to
his
patience
with
them
my
account
of
life
without
philosophy
is
that
it
slips
away
mighty
easily
till
it
is
gone
you
scarcely
know
where
or
how
and
when
you
call
upon
philosophy
at
last
to
give
an
account
of
it
what
does
she
say
asked
margaret
i
do
not
understand
how
life
can
slip
away
so
said
hester
is
there
ever
a
day
without
its
sting
without
doubt
of
somebody
disappointment
in
oneself
or
another
dread
of
some
evil
or
weariness
of
spirit
prosperity
is
no
more
of
a
cure
for
these
than
for
sickness
and
death
if
philosophy
is
well
exclaimed
mr
hope
with
strong
interest
if
philosophy
is
happy
they
that
have
her
for
all
need
her
hear
a
testimony
at
least
as
candid
as
your
own
enderby
if
you
really
find
life
steal
away
as
easily
as
you
now
fancy
depend
upon
it
you
are
more
of
a
philosopher
than
you
are
aware
of
what
is
philosophy
asked
matilda
of
sydney
in
a
loud
whisper
which
the
boy
was
not
in
any
hurry
to
take
notice
of
so
little
was
there
in
the
conversation
which
seemed
to
bear
upon
phosphorus
and
electricity
a
good
question
observed
mr
enderby
hope
will
you
tell
us
children
what
we
are
talking
about
what
philosophy
is
all
this
while
you
gave
us
a
few
meanings
just
now
which
i
should
put
into
one
call
it
enlargement
of
views
and
you
have
wisdom
and
the
love
of
wisdom
and
patience
all
at
once
ay
sydney
and
your
kind
of
philosophy
too
it
was
by
looking
far
and
deep
into
nature
that
men
found
electricity
did
dr
levitt
find
it
out
asked
matilda
he
is
so
very
i
do
believe
he
would
see
those
fish
snapping
up
the
flies
if
he
sat
where
i
do
what
was
that
that
fell
on
my
bonnet
is
it
raining
sydney
tired
of
fishing
had
climbed
into
the
oak
and
was
sending
down
twigs
and
leaves
upon
the
heads
of
the
party
sophia
desired
him
to
come
down
and
even
assured
him
that
if
he
did
not
she
should
be
angry
he
replied
that
he
would
only
stay
to
see
whether
she
would
be
angry
or
not
the
experiment
was
cut
short
by
the
whole
party
rising
and
moving
homewards
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
picked
cowslips
must
not
have
any
dew
upon
them
as
the
group
passed
up
the
street
sydney
in
advance
with
his
rod
and
basket
on
mr
hope
horse
mr
hope
himself
following
with
hester
and
the
tall
mr
enderby
with
sophia
and
margaret
on
either
arm
all
like
the
little
girls
laden
with
cowslips
the
gossips
of
deerbrook
were
satisfied
that
the
stranger
ladies
must
have
enjoyed
their
walk
in
the
meadows
chapter
six
the
mrs
rowland
was
mortified
that
the
greys
had
been
beforehand
with
her
in
the
idea
of
a
from
the
moment
of
matilda
asking
leave
to
accompany
them
she
resolved
to
have
such
an
expedition
from
her
house
as
her
neighbours
should
not
be
able
to
eclipse
like
lear
she
did
not
yet
know
what
her
deed
was
to
be
but
it
should
be
the
wonder
and
terror
of
the
place
she
would
do
such
things
as
should
strike
the
strangers
with
admiration
when
she
heard
an
account
of
it
from
her
little
daughter
she
found
this
had
been
a
very
poor
beginning
a
mere
walk
in
the
meadows
and
home
again
to
tea
no
boiling
the
kettle
in
the
woods
not
even
a
surprise
of
early
strawberries
she
could
not
call
this
being
forestalled
it
could
not
give
the
young
ladies
any
idea
of
a
proper
country
excursion
with
four
or
five
carriages
or
a
boat
with
an
awning
as
soon
as
mr
rowland
came
home
in
the
evening
she
consulted
him
about
the
day
the
place
the
mode
and
the
numbers
to
be
invited
mr
rowland
was
so
well
pleased
to
find
his
lady
in
the
mood
to
be
civil
to
her
neighbours
that
he
started
no
difficulties
and
exerted
himself
to
overcome
such
as
could
not
be
overlooked
all
the
planning
prospered
so
well
that
notes
to
the
grey
family
and
to
the
miss
ibbotsons
lay
on
mr
the
next
morning
inviting
the
whole
party
to
dine
with
mrs
rowland
in
dingleford
woods
that
day
week
the
carriages
to
be
at
the
door
at
ten
the
whole
village
rang
with
the
preparations
for
this
excursion
and
the
village
was
destined
to
ring
with
other
tidings
before
it
took
place
mrs
rowland
often
said
that
she
had
the
worst
luck
in
the
world
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
small
events
fell
out
so
as
to
plague
her
she
had
an
unusual
fertility
in
such
sensible
suppositions
and
reasonable
complaints
and
her
whole
diversity
of
expressions
of
this
kind
was
called
into
play
about
this
expedition
to
dingleford
woods
the
hams
were
actually
boiled
and
the
baked
when
clouds
began
to
gather
in
the
sky
and
on
the
appointed
morning
pattens
clinked
in
the
village
street
miss
young
umbrella
was
wet
through
in
the
mere
transit
from
the
farrier
gate
to
the
schoolroom
the
before
mr
grey
house
was
full
of
yellow
pools
and
the
gurgling
of
spouts
or
drips
from
the
trees
was
heard
on
every
side
the
worst
of
it
was
this
rain
came
after
a
drought
of
many
weeks
which
had
perilled
the
young
crops
and
almost
destroyed
the
hopes
of
hay
the
ladies
and
children
had
been
far
from
sufficiently
sorry
to
hear
that
some
of
the
poorer
wheat
lands
in
the
county
had
been
ploughed
up
and
that
there
was
no
calculating
what
hay
would
be
a
ton
the
next
winter
they
were
now
to
receive
the
retribution
of
their
indifference
rain
had
set
in
and
the
farmers
hoped
that
it
might
continue
for
a
month
it
would
not
be
wise
to
fix
any
country
excursion
for
a
few
weeks
to
come
let
the
young
people
enjoy
any
fine
afternoon
that
they
might
be
able
to
turn
to
the
account
of
a
walk
or
a
drive
or
a
sail
on
the
river
but
picnic
parties
must
be
deferred
till
settled
weather
came
there
was
every
hope
that
the
middle
of
the
summer
would
be
fine
and
seasonable
if
the
rains
came
down
freely
now
this
course
of
meteorological
events
involved
two
great
vexations
to
mrs
rowland
one
was
that
the
neighbours
who
could
pretend
to
entertain
the
strangers
only
in
a
quiet
way
at
home
took
the
opportunity
of
the
rainy
weather
to
do
so
hoping
as
they
said
not
to
interfere
with
any
more
agreeable
engagements
mrs
rowland
really
never
saw
anything
so
dissipated
as
the
greys
they
were
out
almost
every
evening
when
they
had
not
company
at
home
it
was
impossible
that
sophia
studies
could
go
on
as
they
ought
to
do
what
with
taking
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
with
one
acquaintance
and
being
at
a
merry
reading
party
at
another
and
mrs
enderby
little
dance
and
dinner
at
the
levitts
there
were
few
evenings
left
and
on
those
few
evenings
they
were
never
content
to
be
alone
they
were
always
giving
the
young
men
encouragement
to
go
in
mr
hope
made
quite
a
home
house
of
mr
grey
and
as
for
philip
he
seemed
now
to
be
more
at
mr
grey
than
even
at
his
own
mother
or
sister
mrs
grey
ought
to
remember
how
bad
all
this
was
for
a
girl
of
sophia
age
it
would
completely
spoil
the
excursion
to
dingleford
woods
the
young
people
knew
one
another
so
well
by
this
time
that
the
novelty
was
all
worn
off
and
they
would
have
nothing
left
to
say
to
each
other
it
was
provoking
that
mr
rowland
had
promised
that
the
excursion
should
take
place
whenever
the
weather
should
be
settled
enough
it
might
so
fairly
have
been
given
up
and
now
it
must
be
gone
on
with
when
every
one
was
tired
of
the
idea
and
the
young
people
must
almost
be
weary
of
one
another
from
being
always
together
the
other
vexation
was
that
there
were
frequent
short
intervals
of
fine
weather
which
were
immediately
taken
advantage
of
for
a
drive
or
a
walk
or
a
sail
and
it
came
out
one
day
from
the
children
who
had
learned
it
in
the
schoolroom
that
the
miss
ibbotsons
had
been
in
dingleford
woods
there
had
been
no
such
intention
when
the
party
set
out
they
had
not
designed
to
go
nearly
so
far
but
they
had
been
tempted
on
by
the
beauty
of
the
evening
and
of
the
scenery
till
they
had
found
it
the
shortest
way
to
come
home
through
the
dingleford
woods
mrs
rowland
pronounced
this
abominable
and
she
was
not
appeased
by
hearing
that
her
brother
had
been
the
proposer
of
this
mode
of
return
and
the
guide
of
the
party
philip
forgot
everything
she
declared
in
his
fancy
for
these
girls
it
was
always
his
fault
that
he
was
carried
away
by
the
people
he
was
with
he
had
got
the
name
of
a
flirt
by
it
and
a
flirt
he
was
but
she
had
never
known
him
so
possessed
as
he
seemed
to
be
by
these
strangers
she
must
speak
to
mr
rowland
about
it
the
matter
might
really
become
serious
and
if
he
should
ever
be
entrapped
into
marrying
into
the
grey
connections
among
people
so
decidedly
objectionable
it
would
be
a
terrible
to
her
as
long
as
she
lived
that
she
had
not
interfered
in
time
she
should
speak
to
mr
rowland
meanwhile
she
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
her
brother
proceedings
she
found
from
the
children
that
their
uncle
philip
had
fulfilled
his
promise
of
going
to
see
the
schoolroom
and
had
been
so
much
better
than
his
word
that
he
had
been
there
very
often
when
he
went
it
was
always
when
the
miss
ibbotsons
were
there
learning
german
or
drawing
or
talking
with
miss
young
it
was
impossible
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
miss
young
about
this
for
she
always
sent
her
visitors
away
the
moment
the
clock
struck
the
school
hour
the
was
mr
property
too
so
that
mrs
rowland
could
only
be
angry
at
the
studies
which
went
on
in
it
and
had
no
power
to
close
the
doors
against
any
of
the
parties
the
rainy
weather
had
indeed
been
very
propitious
to
the
study
of
german
for
a
fortnight
margaret
had
spent
some
hours
of
each
day
with
miss
young
and
over
their
books
they
had
learned
so
much
of
one
another
heart
and
mind
that
a
strong
regard
had
sprung
up
between
them
this
new
friendship
was
a
great
event
to
miss
young
how
great
she
herself
could
scarcely
have
believed
beforehand
her
pupils
found
that
miss
young
was
now
very
merry
sometimes
mr
grey
observed
to
his
wife
that
the
warmer
weather
seemed
to
agree
with
the
poor
young
woman
as
she
had
some
little
colour
in
her
cheeks
at
last
and
margaret
herself
observed
a
change
in
the
tone
of
the
philosophy
she
had
admired
from
the
beginning
there
was
somewhat
less
of
reasoning
in
it
and
more
of
impulse
it
was
as
sound
as
ever
but
more
genial
while
never
forgetting
the
constancy
of
change
in
human
affairs
she
was
heartily
willing
to
enjoy
the
good
that
befell
her
while
it
lasted
it
was
well
that
she
could
do
so
for
the
good
of
this
new
friendship
was
presently
alloyed
she
was
not
aware
and
it
was
well
that
she
was
not
that
hester
was
jealous
of
her
almost
from
the
hour
of
margaret
learning
what
a
vast
number
of
irregular
verbs
there
is
in
the
german
each
sister
remembered
the
conversation
by
the
open
window
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
at
deerbrook
remembering
it
margaret
made
hester
a
partaker
in
all
her
feelings
about
maria
young
her
admiration
her
pity
her
esteem
reserving
to
herself
any
confidence
which
maria
placed
in
her
in
which
however
no
mention
of
mr
enderby
ever
occurred
she
kept
not
a
thought
or
feeling
of
her
own
from
her
sister
the
consequence
was
that
hester
found
that
maria
filled
a
large
space
in
mind
and
that
a
new
interest
had
risen
up
in
which
she
had
little
share
she
too
remembered
the
conversation
but
had
not
strength
to
act
up
to
the
spirit
of
it
she
had
then
owned
her
weakness
and
called
it
wickedness
and
fancied
that
she
could
never
mistrust
her
sister
again
she
was
now
so
ashamed
of
her
own
consciousness
of
being
once
more
jealous
that
she
strove
to
hide
the
fact
from
herself
and
was
not
therefore
likely
to
tell
it
to
margaret
she
struggled
hourly
with
herself
rebuking
her
own
temper
and
making
appeals
to
her
own
generosity
she
sat
drawing
in
the
little
blue
parlour
morning
after
morning
during
sophia
reading
or
practising
telling
herself
that
margaret
and
miss
young
had
no
secrets
no
desire
to
be
always
that
they
had
properly
invited
her
to
learn
german
and
that
she
had
only
to
go
at
any
moment
and
offer
to
join
them
to
be
joyfully
received
she
argued
with
herself
how
mean
it
would
be
to
do
so
to
agree
to
study
at
last
in
order
to
be
a
sort
of
spy
upon
them
to
watch
over
her
own
interests
as
if
margaret
the
most
sincere
and
faithful
of
living
beings
were
not
to
be
trusted
with
them
she
had
often
vowed
that
she
would
cure
the
jealousy
of
her
temper
now
was
the
occasion
and
she
would
meet
it
she
would
steadily
sit
beside
sophia
or
mrs
grey
every
morning
when
margaret
was
not
with
her
and
never
let
her
sister
know
how
selfish
she
could
be
this
was
all
very
well
but
it
could
not
make
margaret
suppose
her
sister
happy
when
she
was
not
she
could
not
be
certain
what
was
the
matter
but
she
saw
that
something
was
wrong
at
times
hester
manner
was
so
unboundedly
affectionate
that
it
was
impossible
to
suppose
that
unkind
feelings
existed
towards
herself
though
a
few
pettish
words
were
at
other
times
let
drop
hester
moods
of
magnanimity
and
jealousy
were
accounted
for
in
other
ways
by
her
sister
margaret
believed
after
a
course
of
very
close
observation
that
she
had
discovered
in
investigating
the
cause
of
hester
discomposure
a
secret
which
was
unknown
to
her
sister
herself
margaret
was
not
experienced
in
love
nor
in
watching
the
signs
of
it
but
here
was
the
mind
she
understood
best
discomposed
without
apparent
cause
more
fond
more
generous
to
herself
than
ever
yet
not
reposing
its
usual
confidence
in
her
and
subject
to
those
starts
of
delight
and
disappointment
which
she
had
heard
and
could
understand
to
be
the
moods
of
love
she
was
confirmed
in
her
suspicion
by
observing
that
the
merits
of
mr
hope
were
becoming
daily
a
less
common
subject
of
conversation
between
them
while
it
was
certain
that
he
had
in
no
degree
lost
favour
with
either
they
had
been
charmed
with
him
from
the
beginning
and
had
expressed
to
each
other
the
freest
admiration
of
his
truth
his
gaiety
his
accomplishments
and
great
superiority
to
the
people
amidst
whom
he
lived
he
was
now
spoken
of
less
every
day
while
his
visits
grew
more
frequent
longer
and
margaret
could
not
but
think
more
welcome
to
her
sister
the
hours
when
he
was
sure
not
to
come
happened
to
be
those
which
she
spent
with
miss
young
the
hours
in
which
gentlemen
are
devoted
to
their
business
margaret
thus
witnessed
all
that
passed
and
if
her
conjecture
about
hester
was
right
she
could
have
wished
to
see
mr
hope
manner
rather
different
from
what
it
was
he
was
evidently
strongly
attracted
to
the
house
and
there
was
some
reason
to
think
that
mrs
grey
believed
that
hester
was
the
attraction
but
margaret
had
no
such
impression
she
saw
that
mr
hope
admired
her
sister
beauty
listened
to
her
conversation
with
interest
and
was
moved
at
times
by
the
generosity
of
her
tone
of
moral
feeling
but
this
though
much
was
not
enough
for
the
anxious
sister
full
satisfaction
and
the
one
thing
besides
which
she
would
fain
have
discerned
she
could
not
perceive
these
were
early
days
yet
however
so
early
that
in
the
case
of
any
one
whom
she
knew
except
her
sister
she
should
have
supposed
her
own
conjectures
wild
and
almost
improper
but
hester
was
one
of
those
natures
to
which
time
and
circumstance
minister
more
speedily
and
more
abundantly
than
to
the
generality
by
the
strength
of
her
feelings
and
the
activity
of
her
affections
time
was
made
more
comprehensive
and
circumstance
more
weighty
than
to
others
a
day
would
produce
changes
in
her
which
the
impressions
of
a
week
would
not
effect
in
less
passionate
natures
and
what
were
trifling
incidents
to
the
minds
about
her
were
great
events
to
her
margaret
began
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
the
more
she
thought
the
more
plainly
she
perceived
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
occupy
hester
simply
and
naturally
with
as
many
interests
as
possible
this
was
safe
practice
be
the
cause
of
her
occasional
discomposure
what
it
might
it
was
particularly
desirable
that
she
should
not
continue
the
habit
of
sitting
in
silence
for
a
considerable
part
of
every
morning
one
day
just
after
the
voices
of
the
children
had
been
heard
in
the
hall
giving
token
that
school
was
over
hester
sitting
in
the
little
blue
parlour
alone
with
her
head
on
her
hand
was
apparently
contemplating
the
drawing
on
her
board
but
really
considering
that
margaret
was
now
beginning
to
be
happy
with
her
friend
and
asking
why
margaret
should
not
be
happy
with
her
friend
when
margaret
herself
entered
do
you
want
sophia
said
hester
she
is
no
i
want
you
indeed
there
was
an
ironical
tone
of
surprise
in
the
one
word
she
spoke
which
let
fall
a
weight
upon
margaret
heart
an
old
feeling
but
one
to
which
she
had
made
no
progress
towards
being
reconciled
i
can
not
help
you
with
your
german
you
know
how
can
you
pretend
to
want
me
it
is
not
about
the
german
at
all
that
i
want
you
maria
has
found
a
spenser
at
last
and
i
am
going
to
read
her
the
of
heavenly
beauty
i
know
you
never
can
hear
that
often
enough
so
come
perhaps
miss
young
had
rather
not
i
should
be
sorry
to
intrude
myself
upon
her
but
however
continued
she
observing
margaret
look
of
surprise
i
will
come
do
not
wait
for
me
dear
i
will
come
the
moment
i
have
put
up
my
drawing
margaret
did
wait
running
over
the
keys
of
the
open
piano
meanwhile
shall
i
call
sophia
too
asked
hester
as
she
took
up
her
i
dare
say
she
never
read
any
of
spenser
i
dare
say
not
replied
margaret
and
she
would
not
care
about
it
now
if
you
think
we
ought
we
will
call
her
if
not
hester
smiled
nodded
and
led
the
way
to
the
schoolroom
without
calling
sophia
she
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
cordial
presence
of
her
sister
and
maria
before
she
felt
the
full
absurdity
of
the
feelings
which
had
occupied
her
so
lately
and
was
angry
with
herself
to
her
own
satisfaction
her
companions
looked
at
each
other
with
a
smile
as
they
observed
at
the
same
moment
the
downcast
attitude
of
her
moistened
eyes
the
beautiful
blush
on
her
cheek
and
the
expression
of
meek
emotion
on
her
lips
they
thought
that
it
was
the
image
of
heavenly
beauty
which
moved
her
thus
before
they
had
quite
finished
the
hymn
the
door
was
burst
open
and
the
children
entered
dragging
in
mr
enderby
mr
enderby
rebuked
them
for
introducing
him
with
so
little
ceremony
and
declared
to
the
ladies
that
matilda
had
promised
to
knock
before
she
opened
the
door
hester
advised
mary
and
fanny
to
be
more
quiet
in
their
mode
of
entrance
observing
that
they
had
made
miss
young
start
with
their
hurry
matilda
was
glad
her
uncle
remembered
to
come
sometimes
he
had
promised
it
several
weeks
before
he
came
at
all
even
when
he
said
he
was
going
away
in
a
fortnight
and
if
i
had
gone
away
in
a
fortnight
said
he
i
should
not
have
seen
your
schoolroom
but
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
seen
it
as
you
remember
very
well
i
have
been
here
often
lately
but
you
never
attend
to
me
here
uncle
and
i
want
so
to
show
you
my
desk
where
i
keep
my
and
the
you
gave
me
on
my
birthday
well
you
can
show
me
now
can
not
you
so
this
is
your
desk
it
seems
convenient
enough
whatever
we
may
think
of
its
beauty
i
suppose
it
will
hold
all
the
knowledge
you
will
want
to
have
put
into
your
head
for
some
time
to
come
now
show
me
which
is
george
desk
and
which
fanny
and
now
mary
a
nice
row
of
desks
now
whispering
to
her
can
you
show
me
which
is
miss
margaret
desk
the
little
girl
giggled
as
she
answered
that
miss
margaret
was
too
old
to
be
a
so
she
is
but
she
learns
of
miss
young
and
i
know
she
keeps
some
of
her
books
here
can
you
show
me
where
there
was
a
desk
rather
larger
than
the
rest
the
lid
of
which
now
happened
to
be
standing
open
matilda
slyly
pointed
to
it
while
the
ladies
were
engaged
with
the
other
children
mr
enderby
cast
a
glance
into
this
desk
saw
a
book
which
he
knew
to
be
margaret
laid
something
upon
it
from
his
pocket
and
softly
closed
the
lid
the
whole
passing
if
it
was
observed
at
all
as
a
survey
of
the
children
desks
he
then
pretended
to
look
round
for
the
rod
no
rod
said
he
to
the
laughing
children
oh
i
should
like
to
learn
here
very
much
if
there
is
no
rod
miss
margaret
do
you
not
find
it
very
pleasant
learning
here
the
children
were
shouting
miss
young
miss
young
do
let
uncle
philip
come
and
learn
with
us
he
says
he
will
be
a
very
good
boy
wo
you
uncle
philip
miss
young
when
may
uncle
philip
come
and
learn
his
lessons
margaret
saw
that
there
was
constraint
in
the
smile
with
which
maria
answered
the
children
little
as
she
knew
it
struck
her
that
in
his
fun
with
the
children
mr
enderby
was
relying
quite
sufficiently
on
the
philosophy
he
had
professed
to
admire
in
miss
young
mr
enderby
drew
a
chair
to
the
window
round
which
the
ladies
were
sitting
and
took
up
the
volume
margaret
had
just
laid
down
go
go
children
said
he
run
away
to
your
gardens
i
can
not
spare
you
any
more
play
oh
but
uncle
we
want
to
ask
you
a
question
well
ask
it
but
it
is
a
secret
you
must
come
into
the
corner
with
fanny
and
mary
and
me
for
peace
and
quiet
he
went
into
the
corner
with
them
and
they
whispered
into
each
ear
a
question
how
many
burnt
almonds
and
and
how
much
two
shillings
and
threepence
halfpenny
would
buy
the
cowslips
were
now
ready
to
make
tea
of
and
the
feast
on
the
dolls
dishes
might
be
served
any
day
mr
enderby
promised
to
inquire
at
the
confectioner
and
not
to
tell
anybody
else
and
at
last
the
children
were
got
rid
of
now
that
we
have
done
with
mysteries
said
he
as
he
resumed
his
seat
by
the
window
that
is
with
children
mysteries
that
we
can
see
to
the
bottom
of
let
us
look
a
little
into
the
poet
mysteries
what
were
you
reading
show
me
and
i
will
be
your
reader
who
or
what
is
this
heavenly
beauty
we
have
not
done
with
mysteries
yet
i
see
i
was
wondering
said
margaret
smiling
whether
you
take
up
spenser
because
you
are
tired
of
mysteries
in
such
a
case
some
other
poet
might
suit
you
better
what
other
some
one
less
allegorical
at
least
i
do
not
know
that
said
hester
the
most
cunning
allegory
that
ever
was
devised
is
plain
and
easy
in
comparison
with
the
simplest
true
story
fully
told
and
a
man
is
a
poet
in
proportion
as
he
fully
tells
a
simple
true
story
a
story
of
the
mind
you
mean
said
mr
enderby
not
of
the
mere
events
of
life
of
the
mind
of
course
i
mean
without
the
mind
the
mere
life
is
nothing
is
not
allegory
a
very
pretty
way
of
telling
such
a
story
of
the
mind
under
the
appearance
of
telling
a
story
of
a
life
yes
said
margaret
and
that
is
the
reason
why
so
many
like
allegory
there
is
a
pleasure
in
making
one
way
about
a
grotto
in
a
garden
but
i
think
there
is
a
much
higher
one
in
exploring
a
cave
on
the
dim
and
winding
where
you
never
know
that
you
have
come
to
the
end
a
much
higher
pleasure
in
exploring
a
life
than
following
out
an
allegory
you
are
a
true
lover
of
mystery
miss
margaret
you
should
have
lived
a
thousand
years
ago
thank
you
i
am
very
glad
i
did
not
but
why
so
long
ago
are
there
not
mysteries
enough
left
and
will
there
not
be
enough
a
thousand
years
hence
said
hester
i
am
afraid
not
you
and
i
can
not
venture
to
speak
upon
what
the
germans
may
be
doing
but
these
two
ladies
can
tell
us
perhaps
whether
they
are
not
clearing
everything
up
very
fast
making
windows
in
your
cave
miss
margaret
till
nobody
will
be
afraid
to
look
into
every
cranny
of
it
and
then
our
complaint
said
miss
young
will
be
like
mrs
howell
when
somebody
told
her
that
we
were
to
have
the
drummond
light
on
every
church
steeple
dear
said
she
shall
not
know
how
in
the
world
to
get
any
darkness
you
speak
as
if
you
agreed
that
the
germans
really
are
the
makers
of
windows
that
mr
enderby
supposes
them
observed
margaret
but
you
do
not
think
we
are
any
nearer
the
end
of
mysteries
than
ever
do
you
oh
no
not
till
we
have
struck
our
stone
to
the
bottom
of
the
universe
and
walked
round
it
and
i
am
not
aware
that
the
germans
pretend
to
be
able
to
do
that
any
more
than
other
people
indeed
i
think
there
are
as
many
makers
of
grottoes
as
explorers
of
caves
among
them
what
do
you
want
my
dear
this
last
was
addressed
to
george
whose
round
face
red
with
exertion
appeared
at
a
back
window
the
little
girls
were
hoisting
him
up
that
he
might
call
out
once
more
uncle
philip
be
sure
you
remember
not
to
tell
it
would
be
a
pity
that
mysteries
should
come
to
an
end
observed
mr
enderby
when
they
seem
to
please
our
human
tastes
so
well
see
there
how
early
the
love
of
mystery
begins
and
who
can
tell
where
it
ends
is
there
one
of
your
pupils
miss
young
in
whom
you
do
not
find
it
not
one
but
is
there
not
a
wide
difference
between
the
love
of
making
mysteries
and
a
taste
for
finding
them
out
do
you
not
find
both
in
children
and
up
into
old
age
in
children
one
usually
finds
both
but
i
think
the
love
of
and
surprises
goes
off
as
people
grow
wiser
fanny
and
mary
were
plotting
all
last
week
how
to
take
their
sister
sophia
by
surprise
with
a
piece
of
a
token
of
fraternal
affection
as
they
were
pleased
to
call
it
and
you
see
george
has
a
secret
but
they
will
have
fewer
hidings
and
devices
every
year
and
if
they
grow
really
wise
they
will
find
that
amidst
the
actual
business
of
life
there
is
so
much
more
safety
and
ease
and
blessing
in
perfect
frankness
than
in
any
kind
of
concealment
that
they
will
give
themselves
the
liberty
and
peace
of
being
open
as
the
daylight
such
is
my
hope
for
them
but
all
this
need
not
prevent
their
delighting
in
the
mysteries
which
are
not
of
man
making
they
will
be
all
the
more
at
leisure
for
them
said
margaret
from
having
their
minds
free
from
plots
and
secrets
surely
you
are
rather
hard
upon
arts
and
devices
said
philip
without
more
or
fewer
of
them
we
should
make
our
world
into
a
palace
of
truth
see
the
veillees
du
chateau
which
matilda
is
reading
with
miss
young
who
ever
read
it
that
did
not
think
the
palace
of
truth
the
most
disagreeable
place
in
the
world
and
why
asked
margaret
not
because
the
people
in
it
spoke
truth
but
because
the
truth
which
they
spoke
was
hatred
and
malice
and
selfishness
and
how
much
better
inquired
hester
is
the
truth
that
we
should
speak
if
we
were
as
true
as
the
daylight
i
hope
we
shall
always
be
allowed
to
make
mysteries
of
our
own
selfish
and
unkind
fancies
there
would
be
little
mutual
respect
left
if
these
things
were
told
i
think
there
would
be
more
than
ever
said
margaret
carefully
avoiding
to
meet
her
sister
eye
i
think
so
many
mistakes
would
be
explained
so
many
false
impressions
set
right
on
the
instant
of
their
being
made
that
our
mutual
relations
would
go
on
more
harmoniously
than
now
and
what
would
you
do
with
the
affairs
now
dedicated
to
mystery
asked
mr
enderby
how
would
you
deal
with
diplomacy
and
government
and
with
courtship
you
surely
would
not
overthrow
the
whole
art
of
wooing
you
would
not
doom
lovers
plots
and
devices
the
ladies
were
all
silent
mr
enderby
however
was
determined
to
have
an
answer
he
addressed
himself
particularly
to
margaret
you
do
not
disapprove
of
the
little
hidden
tokens
with
which
a
man
may
make
his
feelings
secretly
known
where
he
wishes
them
to
be
understood
tokens
which
may
meet
the
eye
of
one
alone
and
carry
no
meaning
to
any
other
you
do
not
disapprove
of
a
more
gentle
and
mysterious
way
of
saying
love
you
than
looking
full
in
one
another
face
and
declaiming
it
like
a
quaker
upon
affirmation
you
do
not
disapprove
as
for
disapproving
said
margaret
who
chanced
to
perceive
that
maria
hand
shook
so
that
she
could
not
guide
her
needle
and
that
she
was
therefore
apparently
searching
for
something
in
her
as
for
disapproving
i
do
not
pretend
to
judge
for
other
people
she
stopped
short
struck
with
the
blunder
she
had
made
mr
enderby
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
said
laughing
well
then
speak
for
yourself
never
mind
other
people
case
what
i
mean
said
margaret
with
grave
simplicity
is
that
all
depends
upon
the
person
whose
regard
is
to
be
won
there
are
silly
girls
and
weak
women
who
liking
mysteries
in
other
affairs
are
best
pleased
to
be
wooed
with
small
artifices
with
having
their
vanity
and
their
curiosity
piqued
with
sly
compliments
sly
compliments
what
an
expression
such
women
agree
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
old
notion
suitable
enough
five
centuries
ago
that
the
life
of
courtship
should
be
as
unlike
as
possible
to
married
life
but
i
certainly
think
those
much
the
wisest
and
the
happiest
who
look
upon
the
whole
affair
as
the
solemn
matter
that
it
really
is
and
who
desire
to
be
treated
from
the
beginning
with
the
sincerity
and
seriousness
which
they
will
require
after
they
are
married
if
the
same
simplicity
and
seriousness
were
common
in
this
as
are
required
in
other
grave
transactions
said
hester
there
would
be
less
of
the
treachery
delusion
and
which
lie
heavy
upon
the
souls
of
many
a
man
and
many
a
woman
mr
enderby
happening
to
be
looking
out
of
the
window
here
as
if
for
something
to
say
caught
the
eye
of
his
sister
who
was
walking
in
her
garden
she
beckoned
to
him
but
he
took
no
notice
not
desiring
to
be
disturbed
at
present
turning
again
to
margaret
he
said
but
you
would
destroy
all
the
graces
of
courtship
you
would
nay
said
hester
what
is
so
graceful
as
the
simplicity
of
entire
mutual
trust
the
more
entire
the
more
graceful
i
wish
you
had
left
out
the
word
you
have
spoiled
something
that
i
was
going
on
to
say
about
the
simplicity
of
drawing
lots
like
the
moravians
the
most
sincere
courtship
of
all
but
that
word
puts
my
illustration
aside
you
need
not
protest
i
assure
you
i
am
not
so
dull
as
not
to
understand
that
you
think
love
necessary
to
the
wooing
which
seems
graceful
in
your
eyes
oh
yes
love
and
mutual
knowledge
and
mutual
reverence
and
perfect
trust
oh
yes
i
understand
it
all
philip
cried
a
soft
sentimental
voice
under
the
window
brother
i
want
your
arm
for
a
turn
in
the
shrubbery
mrs
rowland
bonnet
was
visible
as
she
looked
up
to
the
window
she
saw
the
braids
of
the
hair
of
the
young
ladies
and
her
voice
was
rather
less
soft
as
she
called
again
philip
do
you
hear
i
want
you
it
was
impossible
to
seem
not
to
hear
mr
enderby
was
obliged
to
go
but
he
left
his
hat
behind
him
as
a
sort
of
pledge
that
he
meant
to
limit
himself
to
the
single
turn
proposed
for
various
reasons
the
young
ladies
were
all
disinclined
to
speak
after
he
had
left
them
miss
young
was
the
first
to
move
she
rose
to
go
to
her
desk
for
something
the
desk
in
which
margaret
kept
the
books
she
used
in
this
place
ever
on
the
watch
to
save
maria
the
trouble
of
moving
about
which
was
actual
pain
to
her
margaret
flew
to
see
if
she
could
not
fetch
what
was
wanted
but
miss
young
was
already
looking
into
the
desk
her
eye
caught
the
pretty
new
little
volume
which
lay
there
she
took
it
up
found
it
was
a
volume
of
tieck
and
saw
on
the
in
the
handwriting
from
pe
one
warm
beam
of
hope
shot
through
her
heart
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
book
lying
in
her
desk
and
thus
addressed
but
it
was
only
one
moment
joy
the
next
instant
reflection
and
the
sight
of
margaret
german
exercise
on
which
the
book
had
lain
revealed
the
real
case
to
her
in
sickness
of
heart
she
would
upon
impulse
have
put
back
the
book
and
concealed
the
incident
but
she
was
not
sure
but
that
margaret
had
seen
the
volume
and
she
sure
of
what
her
own
duty
was
with
a
smile
and
a
steady
voice
she
held
out
the
book
to
margaret
and
said
here
is
something
for
you
margaret
which
looks
a
little
like
one
of
the
hidden
and
gentle
and
mysterious
tokens
mr
enderby
has
been
talking
about
here
it
is
lying
among
your
books
and
i
think
it
was
not
with
them
when
you
last
left
your
seat
margaret
blushed
with
an
emotion
which
seemed
to
the
one
who
knew
her
best
to
be
too
strong
to
be
mere
surprise
she
looked
doubtful
for
a
moment
about
the
book
being
meant
for
her
its
german
aspect
was
conclusive
against
its
being
designed
for
hester
but
miss
young
was
it
certain
that
the
volume
was
not
hers
she
asked
this
but
maria
replied
as
her
head
was
bent
over
her
desk
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
i
am
sure
it
is
nobody
but
yours
some
one
proposed
to
resume
the
reading
the
to
heavenly
was
finished
but
no
remark
followed
each
was
thinking
of
something
else
more
common
subjects
suited
their
present
mood
better
it
was
urged
upon
hester
that
she
should
be
one
of
the
daily
party
and
her
lonely
fancies
being
for
the
hour
dispersed
she
agreed
but
she
observed
other
people
visits
alter
the
case
entirely
i
do
not
see
how
study
is
to
go
on
if
any
one
may
come
in
from
either
house
as
mr
enderby
did
it
is
depriving
miss
young
of
her
leisure
too
and
making
use
of
her
apartment
in
a
way
that
she
may
well
object
to
i
am
here
out
of
school
hours
only
upon
sufferance
replied
miss
young
i
never
call
the
room
mine
without
this
explanation
besides
said
margaret
it
is
a
mere
accident
mr
enderby
coming
in
if
he
makes
a
habit
of
it
we
have
only
to
tell
him
that
we
want
our
time
to
ourselves
miss
young
knew
better
she
made
no
reply
but
she
felt
in
her
inmost
soul
that
her
pleasures
were
from
this
moment
to
be
turned
into
pains
she
knew
mr
enderby
and
knowing
him
foresaw
that
she
was
to
be
a
witness
of
his
wooings
of
another
whom
she
had
just
begun
to
take
to
her
heart
this
was
to
be
her
fate
if
she
was
strong
enough
for
it
strong
enough
to
be
generous
in
allowing
to
margaret
opportunities
which
could
not
without
her
be
enjoyed
of
fixing
the
heart
of
one
whom
she
could
not
pronounce
to
have
been
faulty
towards
herself
his
conversation
today
had
gone
far
to
make
her
suppose
him
blameless
and
herself
alone
in
fault
so
complete
had
seemed
his
unconsciousness
with
regard
to
her
her
duty
then
was
clearly
to
give
them
up
to
each
other
with
such
spirit
of
as
she
might
be
capable
of
if
not
strong
enough
for
this
the
alternative
was
a
daily
painful
retreat
to
her
lodging
whence
she
might
look
out
on
the
heaps
of
cinders
in
the
farrier
yard
her
spirit
abased
the
while
with
the
experience
of
her
own
weakness
neither
alternative
was
very
cheering
chapter
seven
family
confidence
when
do
you
leave
us
philip
inquired
mrs
rowland
putting
her
arm
within
her
brother
and
marching
him
up
the
do
you
wish
me
to
go
replied
he
laughing
is
this
what
you
were
so
anxious
to
say
why
we
understood
six
weeks
since
that
you
meant
to
leave
deerbrook
in
a
fortnight
that
is
all
so
i
did
but
my
mother
is
kind
enough
to
be
pleased
that
i
am
staying
longer
and
since
i
am
equally
pleased
myself
it
is
all
very
well
i
rather
think
too
that
the
children
consider
uncle
philip
a
good
boy
who
deserves
a
holiday
my
mother
oh
she
always
supposes
everything
right
that
you
do
and
that
is
the
reason
why
mr
rowland
and
i
the
reason
why
rowland
and
i
agree
so
well
interrupted
the
brother
yes
that
is
one
reason
among
many
rowland
wish
is
to
see
the
old
lady
happy
and
she
is
naturally
happiest
when
she
has
both
her
children
with
her
and
for
every
merry
hour
of
hers
your
good
husband
looks
the
more
kindly
upon
me
of
course
all
that
is
a
matter
of
course
though
you
are
not
aware
perhaps
of
the
fatigue
it
is
to
my
mother
to
have
any
one
with
her
too
long
a
time
she
will
not
tell
but
you
have
no
idea
how
low
she
is
for
some
time
after
you
go
away
if
you
have
stayed
more
than
a
few
days
from
exhaustion
from
pure
exhaustion
ah
you
do
not
perceive
it
because
the
excitement
keeps
her
up
while
you
are
here
and
she
naturally
makes
an
effort
you
know
but
if
you
were
to
see
her
as
we
do
after
you
are
gone
you
can
not
think
how
it
sets
the
greys
talking
about
her
low
spirits
poor
soul
i
wish
i
could
be
always
with
her
i
will
try
whether
i
can
not
for
some
time
to
come
at
least
but
sister
how
does
it
happen
that
neither
you
nor
rowland
ever
told
me
this
before
oh
we
would
not
distress
you
unnecessarily
we
knew
it
was
an
unavoidable
evil
you
can
not
always
be
here
and
you
must
yes
i
must
sometimes
come
that
is
an
unavoidable
evil
and
always
will
be
sister
while
i
have
a
good
old
mother
living
here
my
dear
philip
how
you
do
misunderstand
one
i
never
heard
anything
so
odd
why
odd
have
you
not
been
giving
me
to
understand
all
this
time
that
you
do
not
wish
to
have
me
here
that
you
want
me
to
go
away
if
not
this
i
do
not
know
what
you
have
been
talking
about
what
an
idea
my
only
brother
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
why
upon
earth
should
i
wish
you
anywhere
else
that
you
may
manage
my
mother
and
her
affairs
all
your
own
way
i
imagine
mrs
rowland
had
nothing
to
oppose
to
this
plain
speech
but
exclamations
when
she
had
exhausted
all
she
could
muster
she
avowed
that
the
only
consideration
which
could
reconcile
her
to
the
sacrifice
of
her
dear
brother
society
was
anxiety
for
his
happiness
then
supposing
i
am
happiest
here
we
are
all
satisfied
and
uncle
philip
would
have
made
a
diversion
from
the
path
to
give
george
his
favourite
swing
quite
up
to
the
second
branch
of
the
great
pray
let
george
swing
himself
for
once
brother
hold
your
tongue
george
you
are
a
very
troublesome
boy
and
your
uncle
and
i
are
busy
it
is
about
your
own
affairs
brother
that
i
want
to
open
my
mind
to
you
as
for
your
always
remaining
here
as
you
kindly
hinted
just
now
i
did
not
mean
to
hint
said
philip
i
thought
i
had
spoken
quite
plainly
well
well
we
all
know
how
to
appreciate
the
kindness
of
your
intentions
i
am
sure
but
your
happiness
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
the
good
of
any
of
us
here
we
can
take
care
of
one
another
but
as
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
find
a
companion
for
life
here
and
as
it
is
time
you
were
thinking
of
settling
we
must
not
be
selfish
and
detain
you
among
us
when
you
should
be
creating
an
interest
elsewhere
mr
rowland
and
i
are
extremely
anxious
to
see
you
happily
married
brother
and
indeed
we
feel
it
is
time
you
were
thinking
about
it
i
am
glad
of
that
sister
i
am
somewhat
of
the
same
opinion
myself
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
replied
the
lady
in
a
rather
uneasy
tone
we
have
been
delighted
to
hear
of
these
frequent
visits
of
yours
to
the
buchanans
there
is
a
strong
attraction
there
i
fancy
philip
joe
buchanan
is
the
attraction
to
me
there
if
you
mean
caroline
she
has
been
engaged
these
three
years
to
her
brother
friend
annesley
you
do
not
say
so
but
you
did
not
know
it
i
have
known
it
these
two
years
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
ah
sister
i
have
had
many
an
hour
amusement
at
your
schemes
on
my
behalf
about
caroline
buchanan
i
have
been
quite
out
i
see
when
do
you
go
to
the
bruces
to
make
the
visit
you
were
disappointed
of
at
christmas
when
they
return
from
the
continent
where
they
are
gone
for
three
years
miss
mary
is
out
of
reach
for
three
years
sister
out
of
reach
you
speak
as
if
paris
or
rome
if
you
will
was
in
australia
and
even
in
australia
one
can
hardly
speak
of
people
being
out
of
reach
if
one
wishes
to
overtake
them
said
mr
enderby
whereas
i
can
wait
very
well
for
the
bruces
till
they
come
home
again
now
no
more
sister
i
can
not
stand
and
hear
the
young
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
catalogued
as
a
speculation
for
my
advantage
i
could
not
look
them
in
the
face
again
after
having
permitted
it
there
is
somebody
in
the
schoolroom
i
declare
cried
the
lady
as
if
astonished
and
she
stood
looking
from
afar
at
the
in
which
three
heads
were
distinctly
visible
were
you
not
aware
of
that
before
did
you
suppose
i
was
asleep
there
or
writing
poetry
all
alone
or
what
the
miss
ibbotsons
are
there
and
miss
young
you
remind
me
said
the
lady
of
something
that
i
declared
to
mr
rowland
that
i
would
speak
to
you
about
my
dear
brother
you
should
have
some
compassion
on
the
young
ladies
you
fall
in
with
i
thought
your
great
anxiety
just
now
was
that
the
young
ladies
should
have
compassion
upon
me
one
philip
the
right
one
but
you
really
have
no
mercy
you
are
too
modest
to
be
aware
of
the
mischief
you
may
be
doing
but
let
me
entreat
you
not
to
turn
the
head
of
a
girl
whom
you
can
not
possibly
think
seriously
of
whom
do
you
mean
you
may
be
making
even
more
mischief
than
flattering
the
poor
girl
with
vain
hopes
if
you
once
let
it
get
into
the
heads
of
the
greys
that
any
one
belonging
to
us
could
think
of
marrying
into
their
connection
you
do
not
know
the
trouble
you
will
impose
upon
mr
rowland
and
me
does
rowland
say
so
does
he
say
so
one
would
think
dear
me
brother
there
is
nothing
one
might
not
think
from
your
manner
you
terrify
me
have
you
a
about
you
asked
philip
i
should
like
to
see
what
this
terrible
manner
of
mine
is
like
now
pray
no
joking
philip
i
declare
my
nerves
will
not
bear
it
but
i
tell
you
what
philip
if
you
let
your
old
admiration
of
beauty
carry
you
away
and
make
you
forget
yourself
so
far
as
to
dream
of
marrying
into
that
connection
you
will
repent
it
as
long
as
you
live
i
shall
never
forgive
you
and
you
will
kill
our
poor
dear
mother
i
will
ask
her
whether
she
thinks
so
said
philip
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
will
not
kill
my
mother
girls
seem
to
think
that
beauty
is
everything
continued
the
angry
lady
and
so
do
their
connections
for
them
i
declare
mrs
grey
sits
winking
at
my
mother
when
miss
ibbotson
has
a
colour
as
if
nobody
ever
saw
a
good
complexion
before
i
declare
it
makes
me
sick
now
philip
you
have
been
fairly
warned
and
if
you
fall
into
the
trap
you
will
not
deserve
any
consideration
from
me
i
have
let
you
lay
down
the
law
to
me
sister
in
your
own
way
because
i
know
your
way
say
what
you
please
to
me
of
myself
and
my
affairs
and
a
joke
is
the
worst
that
will
come
of
it
but
i
tell
you
gravely
that
i
will
not
hear
of
traps
i
will
not
hear
imputations
like
those
you
have
just
spoken
against
these
young
ladies
or
their
connections
without
rebuke
you
can
know
nothing
of
the
miss
ibbotsons
which
can
justify
this
conversation
i
shall
soon
believe
you
are
in
love
cried
the
lady
in
high
resentment
only
take
care
what
grounds
you
go
upon
before
you
speak
and
act
sister
in
my
turn
i
give
you
fair
warning
how
you
take
any
measures
against
them
even
in
your
own
inmost
mind
without
being
quite
sure
what
you
are
about
you
do
not
say
now
that
you
do
not
mean
to
have
that
girl
cried
mrs
rowland
fixing
her
fiery
eyes
upon
her
brother
face
why
should
i
you
have
not
set
about
obtaining
my
confidence
in
any
way
which
could
succeed
if
i
am
in
love
it
would
not
be
easy
to
own
it
upon
such
unwarrantable
pressure
if
i
am
not
in
love
ah
if
you
are
not
in
that
case
i
am
disinclined
to
make
my
not
caring
for
them
the
condition
on
which
those
young
ladies
may
receive
your
civilities
these
civilities
are
due
to
them
whatever
i
may
feel
or
intend
and
my
respect
for
them
is
such
that
i
shall
keep
my
mind
to
myself
at
least
said
the
lady
somewhat
humbled
do
not
be
so
much
with
them
for
my
sake
do
not
go
into
the
schoolroom
again
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
oblige
you
said
he
smiling
but
i
must
go
at
this
moment
not
to
sit
down
not
to
speak
five
words
however
but
only
to
get
my
hat
i
have
to
go
into
the
village
on
an
errand
for
the
children
can
i
do
anything
for
you
in
the
village
she
thinks
only
of
hester
it
is
plain
thought
he
if
i
am
to
have
any
more
lectures
and
advice
i
hope
they
will
proceed
on
the
same
supposition
it
will
make
my
part
easier
and
save
my
being
driven
to
assert
my
own
will
and
so
plunging
poor
priscilla
into
hysterics
i
can
bear
her
interference
as
long
as
margaret
name
is
not
on
her
lips
the
moment
she
casts
an
evil
eye
on
her
i
shall
speak
to
rowland
which
i
had
much
rather
avoid
it
would
be
delicious
too
to
be
protector
without
her
knowing
it
to
watch
over
her
as
she
walks
in
her
bright
innocence
to
shield
her
but
from
whom
from
my
own
sister
no
no
better
keep
her
out
of
suspicion
better
let
it
pass
that
it
is
really
hester
hester
has
plenty
of
friends
to
stand
by
her
the
greys
are
so
proud
of
her
beauty
they
have
no
eyes
or
ears
but
for
her
people
who
meddle
with
concerns
they
have
no
business
with
are
strangely
blind
they
make
odd
mistakes
from
running
away
with
notions
of
their
own
prepared
beforehand
here
is
everybody
determined
that
we
shall
all
fall
in
love
with
hester
priscilla
has
jumped
to
her
conclusion
at
once
perhaps
in
emulation
of
mrs
grey
mrs
grey
has
clearly
given
hester
to
hope
in
her
own
mind
i
rather
think
hope
would
be
obliged
to
her
if
she
would
not
show
so
plainly
what
is
in
her
thoughts
i
fear
so
i
may
be
jealous
but
i
am
afraid
hope
and
i
are
too
much
of
the
same
mind
about
these
girls
i
will
stand
up
for
mrs
grey
as
long
as
i
live
if
she
proves
right
here
she
shall
wink
and
nod
for
evermore
and
i
will
justify
her
if
hope
turns
out
to
be
in
love
with
hester
i
will
be
the
first
to
congratulate
him
if
he
succeeds
with
her
and
really
he
would
be
a
happy
fellow
she
is
a
lovely
creature
and
how
she
will
love
whenever
she
does
love
she
would
be
a
devoted
wife
why
can
not
he
see
the
matter
so
and
leave
my
margaret
to
me
now
how
will
she
look
up
as
i
go
in
his
vision
of
margaret
looks
remained
a
vision
no
one
was
in
the
schoolroom
but
miss
young
writing
a
letter
they
are
not
here
said
mr
enderby
no
they
are
gone
with
mrs
grey
into
the
village
i
believe
oh
well
i
only
came
for
my
hat
you
are
in
the
children
secret
of
course
miss
young
about
their
feast
yes
i
believe
i
know
all
about
it
i
am
going
to
ask
some
important
questions
for
them
at
the
confectioner
you
will
not
object
to
my
bringing
them
a
few
good
things
i
oh
no
i
would
not
act
in
so
serious
a
matter
without
asking
you
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
the
village
or
perhaps
you
may
want
some
pens
mended
before
i
go
no
i
thank
you
then
i
will
not
interrupt
your
letter
any
longer
good
morning
it
was
a
wonder
that
the
letter
was
written
at
all
when
maria
had
done
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
had
taken
up
her
pen
again
she
was
disturbed
by
painful
sounds
from
mrs
rowland
garden
the
lady
own
matilda
and
precious
george
and
darling
anna
were
now
pronounced
to
be
naughty
wilful
mischievous
and
finally
to
be
combined
together
to
break
their
mamma
heart
it
was
clear
that
they
were
receiving
the
discharge
of
the
wrath
which
was
caused
by
somebody
else
now
a
wail
now
a
scream
of
passion
went
to
maria
heart
she
hastened
on
with
her
letter
in
the
hope
that
mrs
rowland
would
presently
go
into
the
house
when
the
little
sufferers
might
be
invited
into
the
schoolroom
to
hear
a
story
or
have
their
ruffled
tempers
calmed
by
some
other
such
simple
means
what
a
life
of
discipline
this
is
thought
maria
we
all
have
it
sooner
or
later
these
poor
children
are
beginning
early
if
one
can
but
help
them
through
it
there
she
goes
in
and
shuts
the
door
behind
her
now
i
may
call
them
hither
and
tell
them
something
or
another
about
una
and
her
lion
at
the
sound
of
miss
young
lame
step
the
little
ones
all
came
about
her
one
ashamed
face
was
hid
on
her
shoulder
another
was
relieved
of
its
salt
tears
and
the
boy
pout
was
first
relaxed
and
then
forgotten
chapter
eight
family
correspondence
from
the
time
of
the
great
event
of
the
arrival
of
the
miss
ibbotsons
mr
hope
had
longed
to
communicate
all
connected
with
it
to
his
family
as
often
as
hester
looked
eminently
beautiful
he
wished
his
sisters
could
see
her
as
often
as
he
felt
his
spirit
moved
and
animated
by
his
conversations
with
margaret
he
thought
of
frank
and
wished
that
the
poor
fellow
could
for
a
day
exchange
the
heats
and
fatigues
and
vapid
society
of
which
he
complained
as
accompaniments
of
service
in
india
for
some
one
of
the
wood
and
meadow
rambles
or
garden
frolics
which
were
the
summer
pleasures
of
deerbrook
now
unspeakably
enhanced
by
the
addition
lately
made
to
its
society
frank
wrote
that
the
very
names
of
meadows
and
kine
of
cowslips
trout
and
harriers
were
a
refreshment
to
a
soldier
fancy
when
the
heats
and
the
solitude
of
spirit
in
which
he
was
compelled
to
live
made
him
weary
of
the
novelties
which
had
at
first
pleased
him
in
the
east
he
begged
that
edward
would
go
on
to
write
as
he
did
of
everything
that
passed
in
the
village
of
everything
which
could
make
him
for
a
whole
evening
fancy
himself
in
deerbrook
and
repose
himself
in
its
shacks
and
quietness
mr
hope
had
felt
for
a
month
past
that
such
a
letter
was
by
this
time
due
to
frank
and
that
he
had
for
once
failed
in
punctuality
but
he
now
for
the
first
time
found
it
difficult
to
get
time
to
write
he
never
dreamed
of
sending
frank
letters
which
would
be
esteemed
by
others
of
a
moderate
length
when
he
did
write
it
was
an
epistle
indeed
and
during
this
particular
may
and
june
there
was
always
something
happening
which
prevented
his
having
his
hours
to
himself
in
other
words
he
was
always
at
the
greys
when
not
engaged
in
his
professional
duties
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
frank
one
day
gave
him
the
necessary
stimulus
and
he
sat
down
on
the
instant
to
open
his
heart
to
his
brother
frank
was
his
younger
and
only
brother
and
the
person
in
the
world
most
deeply
indebted
to
him
their
parents
being
dead
it
was
edward
who
had
been
frank
dependence
as
he
grew
up
it
was
edward
who
had
at
great
cost
and
pains
gratified
his
wish
to
go
into
the
army
and
had
procured
him
the
best
educational
advantages
in
preparation
for
a
military
life
it
was
edward
who
had
always
treated
him
with
such
familiar
friendship
that
he
had
scarcely
felt
as
if
he
wanted
any
other
intimate
and
who
seemed
to
forget
the
five
years
difference
of
age
between
them
at
all
times
but
when
it
afforded
a
reason
for
pressing
kindness
and
assistance
upon
him
the
confidence
between
them
was
as
familiar
and
entire
as
if
they
had
been
the
epistle
which
frank
was
to
have
the
benefit
of
on
the
present
occasion
was
even
longer
than
usual
from
the
delay
which
had
caused
an
accumulation
of
tidings
and
of
thoughts
deerbrook
dear
frank
your
letter
of
december
last
has
arrived
to
remind
me
how
far
i
am
past
my
time
in
writing
to
you
i
make
no
apologies
for
my
delay
however
and
i
do
not
pretend
to
feel
any
remorse
about
it
we
never
write
to
one
another
from
a
mere
sense
of
duty
and
long
may
it
be
before
we
do
so
unless
we
write
because
we
can
not
help
it
pray
let
us
let
it
alone
as
for
the
reasons
why
my
inclination
to
talk
to
you
has
not
overpowered
all
impediments
till
now
you
shall
have
them
meanwhile
here
before
your
eyes
is
the
proof
that
i
can
not
but
spend
this
june
evening
with
you
you
ask
about
your
grandfather
and
i
have
somewhat
to
say
to
you
about
him
he
is
still
living
very
infirm
as
you
may
suppose
but
i
think
as
clear
in
mind
as
i
have
ever
known
him
he
sent
for
me
two
months
ago
as
you
will
have
heard
from
the
letter
i
find
he
caused
to
be
written
to
you
about
the
business
which
then
occupied
his
mind
my
share
in
that
business
he
would
represent
to
you
as
it
appeared
to
him
but
i
must
give
you
an
account
of
it
as
it
appears
to
myself
he
sent
for
me
to
take
leave
of
me
as
he
said
but
in
my
opinion
to
receive
my
acknowledgments
for
his
latest
disposition
of
his
property
by
will
the
new
arrangements
did
not
please
me
at
all
and
i
am
confident
that
you
would
have
liked
them
no
better
than
i
and
i
wished
not
a
little
that
you
were
nearer
that
we
might
have
acted
together
i
know
that
he
once
intended
to
divide
his
property
equally
among
us
four
but
of
late
from
some
unaccountable
feeling
of
indifference
about
emily
and
anne
or
as
is
more
likely
from
some
notion
about
women
not
wanting
money
and
not
knowing
how
to
manage
it
he
has
changed
his
mind
and
destined
his
money
for
you
and
me
leaving
my
sisters
only
a
hundred
pounds
each
as
a
remembrance
he
informed
me
of
this
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
thought
him
quite
well
enough
to
hear
reason
and
i
spoke
my
mind
plainly
to
him
i
had
no
right
to
answer
for
you
any
further
than
for
your
sense
of
justice
and
your
affection
for
your
sisters
the
way
in
which
the
matter
was
settled
at
last
therefore
with
great
pains
and
trouble
was
that
you
and
our
sisters
share
equally
and
that
i
have
the
legacy
of
pounds
which
was
destined
for
one
of
them
the
reasons
why
i
declined
a
fourth
part
of
the
property
were
sufficient
to
my
mind
and
will
be
so
i
doubt
not
to
yours
out
of
this
property
i
have
had
my
professional
education
while
you
and
my
sisters
have
received
nothing
at
all
this
professional
education
has
enabled
me
to
provide
sufficiently
for
myself
so
far
and
this
provision
will
in
all
probability
go
on
to
increase
while
my
sisters
want
as
much
as
can
fairly
be
put
into
their
hands
their
husbands
are
not
likely
ever
to
be
rich
men
and
will
probably
be
poor
for
some
years
to
come
their
children
have
to
be
educated
and
in
short
there
is
every
reason
why
emily
and
anne
should
have
this
money
and
none
why
i
should
i
am
afraid
the
old
gentleman
is
not
very
well
pleased
with
my
way
of
receiving
what
he
intended
for
kindness
but
that
can
not
be
helped
if
he
falls
back
into
his
previous
state
of
mind
and
leaves
the
whole
after
all
to
you
and
me
i
shall
set
the
matter
right
as
far
as
i
can
by
dividing
my
portion
between
my
sisters
and
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
do
the
same
but
i
earnestly
hope
this
will
not
happen
it
will
be
a
very
different
thing
to
my
sisters
receiving
this
money
by
their
grandfather
will
as
their
due
and
from
our
hands
as
a
gift
the
way
in
which
they
will
look
at
it
the
letter
to
you
was
sent
off
without
delay
in
order
that
in
case
of
any
dissatisfaction
whatever
on
your
part
your
wishes
might
have
the
better
chance
of
being
made
known
to
us
during
the
old
life
i
doubt
not
that
your
thoughts
whatever
they
may
be
will
be
on
the
way
to
me
before
this
reaches
you
and
i
can
have
as
little
doubt
what
they
are
you
know
mr
blunt
says
that
men
are
created
to
rob
their
sisters
a
somewhat
partial
view
of
the
objects
and
achievements
of
mortal
existence
it
must
be
owned
and
a
statement
which
i
conceive
the
course
of
your
life
for
one
will
not
go
to
confirm
but
a
man
must
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
of
what
he
is
talking
of
before
he
could
make
so
sweeping
a
generalisation
from
the
facts
of
life
and
i
am
afraid
mr
blunt
has
some
reason
for
what
he
says
medical
men
receive
many
confidences
in
sick
rooms
you
know
and
some
among
others
which
had
better
be
reserved
for
the
lawyer
what
i
have
seen
in
this
way
leads
me
to
imagine
that
my
grandfather
notion
is
a
very
common
one
that
women
have
little
occasion
for
money
and
do
not
know
how
to
manage
it
and
that
their
property
is
to
be
drawn
upon
to
the
very
last
to
meet
the
difficulties
and
supply
the
purposes
of
their
brothers
on
the
utter
injustice
and
absurdity
of
such
a
notion
there
can
be
no
disagreement
between
you
and
me
nor
i
imagine
in
our
actions
with
regard
to
it
i
heard
from
emily
yesterday
the
letter
is
more
than
half
full
of
stories
about
the
children
and
accounts
of
her
principles
and
plans
with
regard
to
them
she
writes
on
the
same
subjects
to
you
no
doubt
for
her
heart
is
full
of
them
her
husband
finds
the
post
of
consul
at
a
little
spanish
port
rather
a
dull
affair
as
we
anticipated
and
groans
at
the
mention
of
bristol
or
liverpool
shipping
he
says
but
i
like
the
tone
of
his
postscript
very
well
he
is
thankful
for
the
honest
independence
his
office
affords
him
and
says
he
can
tolerate
his
spanish
neighbours
though
they
are
as
ignorant
as
turkish
ladies
for
the
sake
of
his
family
and
of
the
hope
of
returning
sooner
or
later
to
live
in
his
own
country
after
having
discharged
his
duty
to
his
children
theirs
must
be
an
irksome
life
enough
as
much
of
it
as
is
passed
out
of
their
own
doors
but
they
seem
to
be
finding
out
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
and
the
as
the
people
are
that
matters
to
their
peace
of
mind
and
i
suppose
those
who
love
each
other
and
have
settled
what
they
are
living
for
can
attain
what
they
most
want
nearly
so
well
in
one
place
as
another
poor
anne
wrote
to
i
know
after
the
death
of
her
infant
her
little
highlandman
as
she
proudly
called
him
in
her
last
letter
before
she
lost
him
gilchrist
talked
last
year
of
bringing
her
and
his
boy
south
this
summer
and
i
had
some
hopes
of
seeing
them
all
here
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
them
to
speak
again
of
travelling
and
i
give
it
up
for
this
year
i
hope
your
letters
and
theirs
fall
due
seasonably
that
your
reports
of
all
your
devices
to
cool
yourself
reach
them
in
the
depth
of
their
caithness
winter
and
that
all
they
say
to
you
of
their
and
freshets
is
acceptable
when
you
are
panting
in
the
hottest
of
your
noons
anne
writes
more
cheerfully
than
she
did
and
gilchrist
says
she
is
exerting
herself
to
overcome
her
sorrow
their
love
must
be
passing
strange
in
the
eyes
of
all
such
as
despised
anne
match
it
is
such
as
should
make
anne
brothers
feel
very
cordially
towards
gilchrist
we
have
drifted
asunder
in
life
rather
strangely
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
and
our
anchorage
grounds
are
pretty
far
apart
who
would
have
thought
it
when
we
four
used
to
climb
the
old
together
and
drop
down
from
the
garden
wall
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
ever
contrive
to
meet
in
one
house
once
more
and
whether
i
may
be
honoured
by
my
house
being
the
place
it
is
possible
and
i
spend
certain
of
my
dreams
upon
the
project
do
you
not
find
that
one
effect
of
this
wide
separation
is
to
make
one
fancy
the
world
smaller
than
one
used
to
think
it
you
on
the
other
side
of
it
probably
waked
up
to
this
conviction
long
ago
it
is
just
opening
upon
me
shut
up
in
my
nook
of
our
little
island
when
i
have
a
letter
from
you
like
that
which
lies
before
me
spiced
with
an
old
family
joke
or
two
and
a
good
many
new
ones
of
your
own
all
exactly
like
yourself
i
am
persuaded
you
can
not
be
very
far
off
and
i
should
certainly
call
you
from
my
window
to
come
in
to
tea
but
from
a
disagreeable
suspicion
that
i
should
get
no
answer
but
do
tell
me
in
your
next
whether
our
globe
has
not
been
made
far
too
much
of
its
children
and
whether
its
oceans
do
not
look
very
like
ponds
when
you
cast
your
eye
over
them
to
that
small
old
i
mentioned
just
now
but
you
want
news
this
being
the
place
of
all
others
to
send
to
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
for
news
deerbrook
has
rung
with
news
and
rumours
of
news
since
winter
the
first
report
after
the
ice
broke
up
in
march
was
that
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
deborah
giles
is
deborah
giles
you
will
ask
she
is
not
going
to
be
a
relation
of
yours
in
the
first
place
secondly
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
boatman
whose
boats
enderby
and
i
are
wont
to
hire
the
young
lady
may
be
all
that
ever
woman
was
for
aught
i
know
for
i
never
spoke
to
her
in
my
life
except
that
i
one
day
asked
her
for
something
to
bale
the
boat
with
but
i
heard
that
the
astonishment
of
deerbrook
was
that
i
was
engaged
to
a
woman
who
could
not
read
or
write
so
you
see
we
of
deerbrook
follow
our
old
pastime
of
first
inventing
marvels
and
then
being
scarcely
able
to
believe
them
i
rather
suspect
that
we
have
some
wag
among
us
who
fabricates
news
to
see
how
much
will
be
received
and
retailed
but
perhaps
these
rumours
even
the
wildest
of
them
rise
natural
exhalation
from
the
nooks
and
crevices
of
village
life
my
five
years
residence
has
not
qualified
me
to
pronounce
absolutely
upon
this
old
smithson
is
dead
you
could
not
have
seen
him
times
when
you
were
here
but
you
may
chance
to
recollect
him
a
short
old
man
with
white
hair
and
grey
eyes
he
is
less
of
a
loss
to
the
village
than
almost
any
other
man
would
be
he
was
so
shy
and
quiet
and
kept
so
much
within
his
own
gate
that
some
fancied
he
must
be
a
miser
but
though
he
spent
little
on
himself
his
money
made
its
way
abroad
and
his
heirs
are
rather
disappointed
at
finding
the
property
no
larger
than
when
he
came
into
it
he
is
much
missed
by
his
household
and
i
own
by
myself
i
was
not
often
with
him
but
it
was
something
to
feel
that
there
was
one
among
us
who
was
free
from
ambition
and
worldly
cares
content
to
live
on
in
the
enjoyment
of
humble
duties
and
simple
pleasures
one
who
would
not
have
changed
colour
at
the
news
of
a
bequest
of
ten
thousand
pounds
but
could
be
very
eager
about
his
prize
at
school
and
about
the
first
of
the
season
beside
his
pond
and
the
first
mushroom
in
his
meadow
during
the
fortnight
of
his
illness
the
village
inquired
about
him
but
when
it
was
all
over
there
was
not
much
to
forget
of
one
so
little
known
and
we
hear
of
him
no
more
the
greys
and
rowlands
go
on
much
as
usual
the
gentlemen
of
the
family
agreeing
very
well
and
the
ladies
rather
the
reverse
the
great
grievance
this
spring
has
been
that
mrs
rowland
has
seen
fit
to
enlarge
her
hall
and
make
a
porch
to
her
door
her
neighbours
are
certain
that
in
the
course
of
her
alterations
every
principal
beam
of
her
house
has
been
cut
through
and
that
the
whole
will
fall
in
no
such
catastrophe
has
yet
occurred
however
i
have
not
been
called
in
to
set
any
broken
bones
and
i
have
not
much
expectation
of
an
accident
as
mr
rowland
understands
building
too
well
to
allow
his
house
to
be
cut
down
over
his
head
as
for
the
porch
i
do
not
perceive
what
can
be
alleged
to
its
disadvantage
but
that
some
people
think
it
ugly
here
i
must
cease
my
gossip
i
regularly
begin
my
letters
with
the
intention
of
telling
you
all
that
i
hear
and
see
out
of
my
profession
but
i
invariably
stop
short
as
i
do
now
from
disgust
at
the
nonsense
i
should
have
to
write
it
is
endurable
enough
to
witness
for
one
thing
quickly
dismisses
another
and
some
relief
occurs
from
the
more
amiable
or
intellectual
qualities
of
the
parties
concerned
but
i
hate
detail
in
writing
and
i
never
do
get
through
the
whole
list
of
particulars
that
i
believe
you
would
like
to
have
you
must
excuse
me
now
and
take
my
word
for
it
in
the
large
that
we
are
all
pretty
much
what
we
were
when
you
saw
us
three
years
ago
except
of
course
being
three
years
older
and
some
few
of
us
three
years
wiser
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
also
to
know
that
my
practice
has
made
a
very
good
growth
for
the
time
you
liked
my
last
year
report
of
it
it
has
increased
more
since
that
time
than
even
during
the
preceding
year
and
i
have
no
further
anxiety
about
my
worldly
prospects
i
am
as
well
satisfied
with
my
choice
of
an
occupation
in
life
as
ever
mine
has
its
anxieties
and
as
others
have
but
i
am
convinced
i
could
not
have
chosen
better
you
saw
when
you
were
with
me
something
of
the
anxiety
of
responsibility
what
it
is
for
instance
to
await
the
one
or
the
other
event
of
a
desperate
case
and
i
could
tell
you
a
good
deal
that
you
do
not
and
can
not
know
of
the
perils
and
troubles
attendant
upon
being
the
depository
of
so
much
domestic
and
personal
confidence
as
my
function
imposes
upon
me
the
necessity
of
receiving
i
sometimes
long
to
be
able
to
see
nothing
but
what
is
apparent
to
all
in
society
to
perceive
what
is
ostensible
and
to
dream
of
nothing
more
not
exactly
like
children
but
like
the
members
of
large
and
happy
families
who
carry
about
with
them
the
purity
and
peace
of
their
homes
and
therefore
take
cognisance
of
the
pure
and
peaceful
only
whom
they
meet
abroad
but
it
is
childish
or
indolent
or
cowardly
to
desire
this
while
there
is
private
vice
and
wretchedness
and
domestic
misunderstanding
one
would
desire
to
know
it
if
one
can
do
anything
to
cure
or
alleviate
it
dr
levitt
and
i
have
the
same
feeling
about
this
and
i
sometimes
hope
that
we
mutually
prepare
for
and
aid
each
other
work
there
is
a
bright
side
to
our
business
as
i
need
not
tell
you
the
mere
exercise
of
our
respective
professions
the
scientific
as
well
as
the
moral
interest
of
them
is
as
much
to
us
as
the
theory
of
your
business
to
you
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
you
will
not
quarrel
with
the
idea
of
the
scientific
interest
of
dr
profession
in
his
hands
for
you
know
how
learned
he
is
in
the
complex
science
of
humanity
you
remember
the
eternal
wonder
of
the
greys
at
his
liberality
towards
dissenters
of
that
liberality
he
is
unconscious
as
it
is
the
natural
the
inevitable
result
of
his
knowledge
of
men
of
his
having
been
the
waterfalls
from
his
youth
up
following
up
thought
and
prejudice
to
their
fountains
when
i
see
him
bland
and
gay
amongst
us
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
his
greatest
pleasure
is
the
same
as
mine
that
of
reposing
in
the
society
of
the
innocent
the
the
unburdened
after
having
seen
what
the
dark
corners
of
social
life
are
it
is
like
coming
out
of
a
foetid
cave
into
the
evening
sunshine
of
late
we
have
felt
this
in
an
extraordinary
degree
but
i
must
tell
you
in
an
orderly
way
what
has
happened
to
us
i
have
put
off
entering
upon
the
grand
subject
partly
from
the
pleasure
of
keeping
one
best
news
for
the
last
and
partly
from
shyness
in
beginning
to
describe
what
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
enter
into
i
am
well
aware
of
your
powers
of
imagination
and
sympathy
but
you
have
not
lived
five
years
within
five
miles
of
a
country
village
and
you
can
no
more
understand
our
present
condition
than
we
can
appreciate
your
sherbet
and
your
mountain
there
are
two
ladies
here
from
birmingham
so
far
beyond
any
ladies
that
we
have
to
boast
of
that
some
of
us
begin
to
suspect
that
deerbrook
is
not
the
athens
and
arcadia
united
that
we
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
it
you
can
have
no
idea
how
our
vanity
is
mortified
and
our
pride
abased
by
finding
what
the
world
can
produce
out
of
the
bounds
of
deerbrook
we
bear
our
humiliation
wonderfully
however
our
verdon
woods
echo
with
laughter
and
singing
is
heard
beside
the
brook
the
voices
of
children
grown
and
ungrown
go
up
from
all
the
meadows
around
and
wit
and
wisdom
are
wafted
over
the
surface
of
our
river
at
eventide
the
truth
is
these
girls
have
brought
in
a
new
life
among
us
and
there
is
not
one
of
us
except
the
children
that
is
not
some
years
younger
for
their
presence
mr
grey
deserts
his
business
for
them
like
a
and
mr
rowland
watches
his
opportunity
to
play
truant
in
turn
mrs
enderby
gives
dances
and
looks
quite
disposed
to
lead
off
in
person
mrs
plumstead
has
grown
quite
giddy
about
sorting
the
letters
and
her
voice
has
not
been
heard
further
than
three
doors
off
since
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
dr
levitt
is
preaching
his
old
sermons
mrs
grey
is
intoxicated
with
being
the
hostess
of
these
ladies
and
has
even
reached
the
point
of
allowing
her
to
be
used
every
afternoon
enderby
is
a
fixture
while
they
are
so
neither
mother
sister
friend
nor
frolic
ever
detained
him
here
before
for
a
month
together
he
was
going
away
in
a
fortnight
when
these
ladies
came
they
have
been
here
six
weeks
and
enderby
has
dropped
all
mention
of
the
external
world
if
you
ask
as
you
are
at
this
moment
doing
in
your
own
heart
how
i
stand
under
this
influence
i
really
can
not
tell
you
i
avoid
inquiring
too
closely
i
enjoy
every
passing
day
too
much
to
question
it
and
i
let
it
go
and
so
must
you
who
are
they
you
want
to
know
they
are
distant
cousins
of
mr
grey
orphans
and
in
mourning
for
their
father
they
are
just
above
twenty
and
their
name
is
ibbotson
they
handsome
is
your
next
question
the
eldest
hester
is
beautiful
as
the
evening
star
margaret
is
very
different
it
does
not
matter
what
she
is
as
to
beauty
for
the
question
seems
never
to
have
entered
her
own
mind
i
doubt
whether
it
has
often
occurred
to
her
whether
she
can
be
this
or
that
or
the
other
she
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
such
pure
without
question
without
introspection
without
hesitation
or
consciousness
i
never
saw
in
any
one
above
eight
years
old
yet
she
is
wise
it
becomes
not
me
to
estimate
how
wise
you
will
ask
how
i
know
this
already
i
knew
it
the
first
day
i
saw
them
i
knew
it
by
her
infinite
simplicity
from
which
all
selfishness
is
discharged
and
into
which
no
folly
can
enter
the
airs
of
heaven
must
have
been
about
her
from
her
infancy
to
nourish
such
health
of
the
soul
what
her
struggle
is
to
be
in
life
i
can
not
conceive
for
not
a
morbid
tendency
is
to
be
discerned
i
suppose
she
may
be
destined
to
make
mistakes
to
find
her
faith
deceived
her
affections
rebuked
her
full
repose
delayed
if
like
the
rest
of
us
she
be
destined
to
struggle
it
must
be
to
conflict
of
this
kind
for
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
should
arise
from
herself
yet
is
she
as
truly
human
as
the
weakest
of
us
engrossed
by
affection
and
susceptible
of
passion
her
affection
for
her
sister
is
a
sort
of
passion
it
has
some
of
the
features
of
the
serene
guardianship
of
one
from
on
high
but
it
is
yet
more
like
the
passionate
servitude
of
the
benefited
to
a
benefactor
for
instance
which
is
perhaps
the
most
graceful
attitude
in
which
our
humanity
appears
where
are
the
words
that
can
tell
what
it
is
to
witness
day
by
day
the
course
of
such
a
life
as
this
to
see
living
and
moving
before
one
eyes
the
very
spirit
that
one
had
caught
glimpses
of
wandering
in
the
brightest
vistas
of
one
imagination
in
the
holiest
hours
of
thought
yet
is
there
nothing
fearful
as
in
the
presence
of
a
spirit
there
is
scarcely
even
a
sense
of
awe
so
childlike
is
her
deportment
i
go
grave
and
longing
to
listen
i
come
away
and
i
find
i
have
been
talking
more
than
any
one
revealing
discussing
as
if
i
were
the
teacher
and
not
the
learner
you
will
say
the
worshipper
say
it
if
you
will
our
whole
little
world
worships
the
one
or
the
other
hester
is
also
well
worthy
of
worship
if
there
were
nothing
but
her
beauty
she
would
have
a
wider
world
than
ours
of
deerbrook
at
her
feet
but
she
has
much
more
she
is
what
you
would
call
a
true
woman
she
has
a
generous
soul
strong
affections
and
a
susceptibility
which
interferes
with
her
serenity
she
is
not
exempt
from
the
trouble
and
snare
into
which
the
lot
of
women
seems
to
drive
them
too
close
a
contemplation
of
self
too
nice
a
sensitiveness
which
yet
does
not
interfere
with
devotedness
to
others
she
will
be
a
devoted
wife
but
margaret
does
not
wait
to
be
a
wife
to
be
devoted
her
life
has
been
devotedness
and
will
be
to
the
end
if
she
were
left
the
last
of
her
race
she
would
spend
her
life
in
worshipping
the
unseen
that
lay
about
her
and
would
be
as
unaware
of
herself
as
now
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
speak
freely
of
them
this
is
the
first
relief
of
the
kind
i
have
had
every
one
is
praising
them
every
one
is
following
them
but
to
whom
but
you
can
i
speak
of
them
even
to
you
i
filled
my
first
sheet
with
mere
surface
matter
i
now
wonder
how
i
could
as
for
the
opinion
of
deerbrook
on
the
engrossing
subject
of
the
summer
you
will
anticipate
it
in
your
own
mind
concluding
that
hester
is
most
worshipped
on
account
of
her
beauty
and
that
margaret
influence
must
be
too
subtle
and
refined
to
operate
on
more
than
a
few
this
is
partly
but
not
wholly
the
case
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
from
the
beginning
by
the
many
that
hester
is
to
be
exclusively
the
adored
and
enderby
has
i
fancy
as
many
broad
hints
as
myself
of
this
general
conclusion
but
i
question
whether
enderby
assents
any
more
than
myself
influence
may
be
received
as
unconsciously
as
it
is
exerted
but
it
is
not
therefore
the
less
real
while
it
is
the
more
potent
i
see
old
jem
bird
raise
himself
up
from
the
churchyard
bench
by
his
staff
and
stand
uncovered
as
hester
passes
by
i
see
the
children
in
the
road
touch
one
another
and
look
up
at
her
i
see
the
admiration
which
diffuses
itself
like
sunshine
around
her
steps
all
this
homage
to
hester
is
visible
enough
but
i
also
see
sydney
grey
growing
manly
and
his
sisters
amiable
under
margaret
eye
i
fancy
i
perceive
enderby
but
that
is
his
own
affair
i
am
sure
i
daily
witness
one
healing
and
renovating
process
which
margaret
is
unconsciously
effecting
there
is
no
one
of
us
so
worthy
of
her
so
capable
of
appreciating
her
as
maria
young
they
are
friends
and
maria
young
is
becoming
a
new
creature
health
and
spirit
are
returning
to
that
poor
girl
countenance
there
is
absolutely
a
new
tone
in
her
voice
and
a
joyous
strain
in
her
conversation
which
i
for
one
never
recognised
before
it
is
a
sight
on
which
angels
might
look
down
to
see
margaret
with
her
earnest
face
listening
humbly
and
lovingly
serving
the
infirm
and
friend
whom
she
herself
is
daily
lifting
up
into
life
and
gladness
i
have
done
with
listening
to
abuse
of
life
and
the
world
i
will
never
sit
still
under
it
again
if
there
are
two
such
as
these
sisters
springing
out
of
the
bosom
of
a
busy
town
and
quietly
passing
along
their
path
of
life
casting
sanctity
around
them
as
they
go
if
there
are
two
such
why
not
more
if
god
casts
such
seeds
of
goodness
into
our
nook
how
do
we
know
but
that
he
is
sowing
the
whole
earth
with
it
i
will
believe
it
henceforth
you
will
wonder
as
i
have
wondered
many
a
time
within
the
last
six
weeks
what
is
to
become
of
us
when
we
lose
these
strangers
i
can
only
say
help
us
but
that
time
is
far
off
they
came
for
several
months
and
no
one
hints
at
their
departure
yet
they
are
the
most
unlearned
creatures
about
country
life
that
you
can
conceive
with
a
surpassing
genius
for
country
pleasures
only
imagine
the
charm
of
our
excursions
they
are
never
so
happy
as
when
in
the
fields
or
on
the
river
and
we
all
feel
ourselves
only
too
blest
in
being
able
to
indulge
them
our
mornings
are
all
activity
and
despatch
that
our
afternoons
may
be
all
mirth
and
our
evenings
repose
i
am
afraid
this
will
make
you
sigh
with
mingled
envy
and
sympathy
but
whatever
is
that
can
be
told
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
i
shall
tell
you
trusting
to
your
feeling
both
pleasure
and
pain
in
virtuous
moderation
i
have
done
my
story
and
now
i
am
going
to
look
what
it
is
a
thing
i
have
refrained
from
in
my
impulse
to
tell
you
all
the
house
is
quite
still
and
i
heard
the
church
clock
strike
something
very
long
just
now
but
i
would
not
count
it
is
so
it
was
midnight
that
the
clock
struck
i
shall
seal
this
up
directly
i
dare
not
trust
my
morning
my
broad
daylight
mood
with
it
now
as
soon
as
you
have
got
thus
far
just
take
up
your
pen
and
answer
me
telling
me
as
copiously
of
your
affairs
as
i
have
written
of
ours
heaven
bless
you
yours
ever
edward
hope
it
was
not
only
mr
hope
broad
daylight
mood
which
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
this
letter
in
this
hour
of
midnight
a
misgiving
seized
upon
him
that
it
was
extravagant
he
became
aware
when
he
laid
down
his
pen
that
he
was
agitated
the
door
of
his
room
opened
into
the
garden
he
thought
he
would
look
out
upon
the
night
it
was
the
night
of
the
full
moon
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
the
festoons
of
creepers
that
dangled
from
his
little
porch
waved
in
the
night
breeze
long
shadows
from
the
shrubs
lay
on
the
grass
and
in
the
depth
of
one
of
these
shadows
glimmered
the
green
spark
of
a
it
was
deliciously
cool
and
serene
mr
hope
stood
leaning
against
the
with
his
arms
folded
and
was
not
long
in
settling
the
question
whether
the
letter
should
go
frank
will
think
that
i
am
in
love
he
considered
he
will
not
understand
the
real
state
of
my
feeling
he
will
think
that
i
am
in
love
i
should
conclude
so
in
his
place
but
what
matters
it
what
he
infers
and
concludes
i
have
written
exactly
what
i
thought
and
felt
at
the
moment
and
it
is
not
from
such
revelations
that
wrong
inferences
are
usually
drawn
what
i
have
written
is
true
and
truth
carries
safely
over
land
and
sea
more
safely
than
confidence
compounded
with
caution
frank
deserves
the
simplest
and
freshest
confidence
from
me
i
am
glad
that
no
hesitation
occurred
to
me
while
i
wrote
it
shall
go
every
word
of
it
he
returned
to
his
desk
sealed
and
addressed
the
letter
and
placed
it
where
it
was
sure
to
be
seen
in
the
morning
and
carried
to
the
before
he
rose
chapter
nine
child
play
the
afternoon
arrived
when
the
children
were
to
have
their
feast
in
the
from
the
hour
of
dinner
the
little
people
were
as
busy
as
aldermen
cooks
spreading
their
table
sydney
thought
himself
too
old
for
such
play
he
was
hard
at
work
filling
up
the
pond
he
had
dug
in
his
garden
having
tried
experiments
with
it
for
several
weeks
and
found
that
it
never
held
water
but
in
a
pouring
rain
while
he
was
occupied
with
his
spade
his
sisters
and
the
little
rowlands
were
arranging
their
dishes
and
brewing
their
our
mamma
is
coming
said
fanny
to
matilda
is
yours
no
she
says
she
ca
come
but
papa
will
so
will
our
papa
it
was
so
funny
at
dinner
mr
paxton
came
in
and
asked
whether
papa
would
ride
with
him
and
papa
said
it
was
out
of
the
question
it
must
be
for
he
had
an
engagement
this
afternoon
a
very
particular
engagement
he
said
observed
mary
and
he
smiled
at
me
so
i
could
not
help
laughing
fanny
do
look
at
matilda
dish
of
strawberries
how
pretty
there
somebody
coming
observed
little
anna
who
being
too
young
to
help
and
liable
to
be
tempted
to
put
her
fingers
into
the
good
things
was
sent
to
amuse
herself
with
jumping
up
and
down
the
steps
there
now
that
is
always
the
way
is
not
it
miss
young
cried
fanny
who
is
it
george
mr
enderby
oh
do
not
let
him
come
in
yet
tell
him
he
must
not
come
this
mr
enderby
chose
to
enter
however
and
all
opposition
gave
way
before
him
pray
do
send
me
back
said
he
till
you
know
what
i
am
come
for
now
who
will
pick
my
pockets
little
anna
was
most
on
a
level
with
the
coat
pocket
she
almost
buried
her
face
in
it
as
she
dived
the
whole
length
of
her
arm
to
the
very
bottom
george
attacked
its
fellow
while
the
waistcoat
pockets
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
taller
children
a
number
of
white
parcels
made
their
appearance
and
the
little
girls
screamed
with
delight
miss
young
cried
fanny
do
come
and
help
us
to
pick
mr
pockets
see
what
i
have
got
the
very
largest
of
all
when
every
pocket
had
been
thoroughly
picked
without
miss
assistance
the
table
did
indeed
show
a
goodly
pile
of
white
cornucopia
that
most
agitating
form
of
paper
to
children
eyes
when
opened
there
was
found
such
a
store
of
sweet
things
as
the
little
girls
had
seldom
before
seen
out
of
the
confectioner
shop
difficulties
are
apt
to
come
with
good
fortune
and
the
anxious
question
was
now
asked
how
all
these
dainties
were
to
be
dished
up
miss
young
was
as
usual
the
friend
in
need
she
had
before
lent
two
small
china
plates
of
her
own
and
she
now
supplied
the
further
want
she
knew
how
to
make
pretty
square
boxes
out
of
and
her
nimble
scissors
and
neat
fingers
now
provided
a
sufficiency
of
these
in
a
trice
uncle
philip
was
called
upon
as
each
was
finished
to
admire
her
skill
and
admire
he
did
to
the
children
entire
content
is
this
feast
mr
enderby
inquired
mary
finally
when
anna
had
been
sent
to
summon
the
company
may
we
say
it
is
ours
to
be
sure
cried
fanny
whose
else
should
it
be
it
is
all
your
own
i
assure
you
said
mr
enderby
now
you
two
should
stand
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
matilda
at
the
foot
i
think
i
had
better
take
this
place
said
sydney
who
had
made
his
appearance
and
who
thought
much
better
of
the
affair
now
that
he
saw
mr
enderby
so
much
interested
in
it
there
should
always
be
a
gentleman
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
no
no
sydney
protested
mr
enderby
not
when
he
has
had
no
cost
nor
trouble
about
the
feast
march
off
you
are
only
one
of
the
company
stand
there
matilda
and
remember
you
must
look
very
polite
i
shall
hide
behind
the
acacia
there
and
come
in
with
the
ladies
a
sudden
and
pelting
shower
was
now
falling
however
and
instead
of
hiding
behind
a
tree
mr
enderby
had
to
run
between
the
house
and
the
schoolroom
holding
umbrellas
over
the
ladies
heads
setting
clogs
for
them
and
assuring
mrs
grey
at
each
return
that
the
feast
could
not
be
deferred
and
that
nobody
should
catch
cold
mr
grey
was
on
the
spot
to
give
his
arm
to
mrs
enderby
who
had
luckily
chanced
to
look
in
a
thing
which
she
really
never
did
after
dinner
mr
hope
had
been
seen
riding
by
and
mrs
grey
had
sent
after
him
to
beg
he
would
come
in
mr
rowland
made
a
point
of
being
present
and
thus
the
was
quite
full
really
crowded
i
am
glad
mrs
rowland
keeps
away
whispered
mrs
grey
to
sophia
she
would
say
it
is
insufferably
hot
yes
that
she
would
do
not
you
think
we
might
have
that
window
open
the
rain
does
not
come
in
on
that
side
did
you
ever
see
such
a
feast
as
the
children
have
got
i
am
sure
poor
elizabeth
and
i
never
managed
such
a
one
it
is
really
a
pity
mrs
rowland
should
not
see
it
mr
rowland
should
have
made
her
come
it
looks
so
odd
her
being
the
only
one
to
stay
away
the
room
resounded
with
exclamations
and
admiration
and
grave
jokes
upon
the
children
notwithstanding
all
uncle
philip
could
do
the
ingenuous
little
girls
answered
to
every
compliment
that
mr
enderby
brought
his
and
that
that
and
the
other
came
out
of
uncle
pocket
they
stood
in
their
places
blushing
and
laughing
and
served
out
their
dainties
with
hands
trembling
with
delight
maria
pleasure
was
as
usual
in
observing
all
that
went
on
she
could
do
this
while
replying
quite
to
the
purpose
to
mrs
enderby
praise
of
her
management
of
the
dear
children
and
to
pressing
offers
of
cake
and
to
mr
rowland
suspicions
that
the
children
would
never
have
accomplished
this
achievement
without
her
as
indeed
he
might
say
of
all
their
achievements
and
to
anna
entreaty
that
she
would
eat
a
pink
comfit
and
then
a
yellow
one
and
then
a
green
one
and
to
mrs
grey
wonder
where
she
could
have
put
away
all
her
books
and
things
to
make
so
much
room
for
the
children
she
could
see
mr
hope
look
of
delight
when
margaret
declined
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
said
she
preferred
tasting
some
of
the
she
saw
how
he
helped
mary
to
pour
out
the
tea
and
how
quietly
he
took
the
opportunity
of
getting
rid
of
it
through
the
window
behind
margaret
when
she
could
not
pretend
to
say
that
she
liked
it
she
observed
mr
rowland
somewhat
stiff
politeness
to
hester
and
mr
enderby
equal
partition
of
his
attentions
between
the
two
sisters
she
could
see
mrs
grey
watching
every
strawberry
and
that
went
down
the
throats
of
the
little
rowlands
and
her
care
seconded
by
sophia
that
her
own
children
should
have
an
exactly
equal
portion
of
the
good
things
she
believed
but
was
not
quite
sure
that
she
saw
hester
colour
and
manner
change
as
mr
hope
came
and
went
in
the
course
of
his
service
about
the
table
and
that
once
upon
receiving
some
slight
attention
from
him
she
threw
a
hasty
glance
towards
her
sister
and
turned
quite
away
upon
meeting
her
eye
the
rain
had
not
prevented
the
servants
from
trying
to
amuse
themselves
with
witnessing
the
amusement
of
the
family
they
were
clustered
together
under
umbrellas
at
the
window
nearest
the
stables
where
they
thought
they
should
be
least
observed
some
commotion
took
place
among
them
at
the
same
moment
that
an
extraordinary
sound
became
audible
from
a
distance
above
the
clatter
of
plates
and
the
mingling
of
voices
in
the
what
in
the
world
is
that
noise
asked
margaret
only
somebody
killing
a
pig
replied
sydney
decidedly
do
not
believe
him
said
mr
enderby
the
deerbrook
people
have
better
manners
than
to
kill
their
pigs
in
the
hearing
of
ladies
on
summer
afternoons
but
what
is
it
it
seems
coming
nearer
i
once
told
you
said
mr
enderby
that
we
possess
an
inhabitant
whose
voice
you
might
know
before
her
name
i
suspect
it
is
that
same
voice
which
we
hear
now
a
human
voice
impossible
what
is
the
matter
alice
mrs
grey
asked
of
her
maid
out
of
the
window
oh
it
is
mrs
plumstead
and
she
is
coming
this
way
she
will
be
upon
us
before
we
can
get
to
the
house
oh
what
shall
we
do
mrs
grey
entreated
permission
of
the
ladies
to
allow
the
to
come
into
the
their
caps
might
be
torn
from
their
heads
before
they
could
defend
themselves
she
said
if
they
remained
outside
of
course
leave
was
given
instantly
and
the
maids
crowded
in
with
chattering
teeth
and
many
a
tale
of
deeds
done
by
mrs
plumstead
in
her
paroxysms
of
rage
the
children
shared
the
panic
more
or
less
and
not
only
they
mr
grey
proposed
to
put
up
the
shutters
of
the
windows
nearest
to
the
scene
of
action
but
it
was
thought
that
this
might
draw
on
an
attack
from
the
virago
who
might
let
the
party
alone
if
she
were
left
unnoticed
by
them
she
was
now
full
in
sight
as
with
half
deerbrook
at
her
heels
she
pursued
the
object
of
her
rage
through
the
falling
shower
and
amidst
the
puddles
in
front
of
the
stables
her
widow
cap
was
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
hair
hanging
from
beneath
it
wet
in
the
rain
her
black
gown
was
splashed
to
the
shoulders
her
hands
were
clenched
her
face
was
white
as
her
apron
and
her
vociferations
were
dreadful
to
hear
she
was
hunting
a
poor
terrified
young
countrywoman
who
between
fright
and
running
looked
ready
to
sink
we
must
put
a
stop
to
this
cried
mr
grey
and
mr
rowland
each
speaking
to
the
other
it
ended
with
their
issuing
forth
together
looking
as
dignified
as
they
could
and
placing
themselves
between
the
scold
and
her
victim
it
would
not
do
they
could
not
make
themselves
heard
and
when
she
shook
her
fist
in
their
faces
they
retired
backwards
and
took
refuge
among
their
party
bringing
the
victim
in
with
them
however
mr
enderby
declared
this
retreat
too
bad
and
was
gone
before
the
entreaties
of
his
little
nieces
could
stop
him
he
held
his
ground
longer
and
the
dumb
show
he
made
was
so
energetic
as
to
cause
a
laugh
in
the
in
the
midst
of
the
uneasiness
of
his
friends
and
to
call
forth
shouts
of
mirth
from
the
crowd
at
the
virago
heels
that
will
not
do
it
will
only
exasperate
her
the
more
said
mr
hope
pressing
his
way
to
the
door
let
me
pass
will
you
oh
mr
hope
oh
sir
said
alice
do
go
do
think
of
going
sir
she
does
not
mind
killing
anybody
i
assure
you
sir
oh
mr
hope
do
go
cried
almost
everybody
maria
was
sure
she
heard
hester
voice
among
the
rest
the
young
countrywoman
and
the
children
grasped
the
skirts
of
his
coat
but
he
shook
them
off
laughing
and
went
little
mary
loved
mr
hope
very
dearly
she
shot
out
at
the
door
with
him
and
clasped
her
hands
before
mrs
plumstead
looking
up
piteously
as
if
to
implore
her
to
do
mr
hope
no
harm
already
however
the
vixen
mood
had
changed
at
the
first
glimpse
of
mr
hope
her
voice
sank
from
being
a
squall
into
some
resemblance
to
human
utterance
she
pulled
her
cap
forward
and
a
tinge
of
colour
returned
to
her
white
lips
mr
enderby
caught
up
little
mary
and
carried
her
to
her
mamma
crying
bitterly
mr
hope
might
safely
be
left
to
finish
his
conquest
of
the
otherwise
unconquerable
scold
he
stood
still
till
he
could
make
himself
heard
looking
her
full
in
the
face
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
would
listen
to
his
remonstrance
and
even
at
length
take
his
advice
to
go
home
and
compose
herself
he
went
with
her
to
ensure
the
good
behaviour
of
her
neighbours
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
lock
herself
into
her
house
alone
before
he
returned
to
his
party
it
is
as
you
told
me
said
margaret
to
mr
enderby
mr
hope
power
extends
even
to
the
temper
of
the
deerbrook
scold
how
she
began
to
grow
quiet
directly
it
was
like
magic
mr
enderby
smiled
but
there
was
some
uneasiness
in
his
smile
the
countrywoman
was
commended
to
the
servants
to
be
refreshed
and
dismissed
another
way
there
was
no
further
reason
for
detaining
her
when
it
appeared
that
she
really
could
give
no
account
of
how
she
had
offended
mrs
plumstead
in
selling
her
a
pound
of
butter
it
remained
to
console
little
mary
who
was
still
crying
more
from
grief
for
mrs
plumstead
than
from
fear
maria
thought
though
mrs
grey
was
profuse
in
assurances
to
the
child
that
mrs
plumstead
should
not
be
allowed
to
frighten
her
any
more
all
the
children
seemed
so
depressed
and
confounded
that
their
guests
exerted
themselves
to
be
merry
again
and
to
efface
as
far
as
was
possible
the
impression
of
the
late
scene
when
mr
hope
returned
he
found
mr
grey
singing
his
single
ditty
about
dame
dumshire
and
her
amidst
great
mirth
and
unbounded
applause
then
mrs
enderby
was
fluttered
and
somewhat
flattered
by
an
entreaty
that
she
would
favour
the
company
with
one
of
the
ballads
for
which
she
had
been
famous
in
her
time
she
could
not
refuse
on
such
an
occasion
if
indeed
she
had
ever
been
able
to
refuse
what
she
was
told
would
give
pleasure
she
made
her
son
choose
for
her
what
she
should
sing
and
then
followed
a
wonderful
story
of
giles
collins
who
loved
a
lady
giles
and
the
lady
both
died
of
true
love
giles
was
laid
in
the
lower
chancel
and
the
lady
in
the
higher
from
the
one
grave
grew
a
rose
and
from
the
other
a
briar
both
of
which
climbed
up
to
the
church
top
and
there
tied
themselves
into
a
knot
which
made
all
the
parish
admire
at
this
part
anna
was
seen
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
but
the
rest
had
no
eyes
but
for
mrs
enderby
as
she
gazed
full
at
the
opposite
wall
and
the
shrill
quavering
notes
of
the
monotonous
air
were
poured
out
and
the
words
were
as
distinct
as
if
they
were
spoken
is
that
true
grandmamma
asked
anna
when
all
was
over
you
had
better
ask
the
person
who
made
the
song
my
dear
i
did
not
make
it
but
did
you
ever
see
that
church
with
the
briar
growing
in
it
before
the
sexton
cut
it
down
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
about
it
said
philip
solemnly
i
wonder
grandmamma
dares
sing
such
a
sad
song
why
you
asked
her
uncle
philip
oh
ay
so
i
did
well
we
are
much
obliged
to
her
and
now
we
will
have
something
that
is
not
quite
so
miss
grey
you
will
favour
us
with
a
song
sophia
were
all
in
the
house
and
she
could
not
sing
without
mr
enderby
would
fetch
some
if
she
would
give
him
directions
what
to
bring
no
she
could
not
sing
without
the
piano
as
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
bring
that
philip
feared
the
company
must
wait
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
miss
grey
till
another
time
mr
grey
would
have
hester
and
margaret
sing
and
sing
they
did
very
simply
and
sweetly
and
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
one
thing
led
on
to
another
they
sang
together
with
mr
grey
with
mr
enderby
mr
hope
listening
with
an
unlearned
eagerness
which
made
mrs
grey
wink
at
her
husband
and
nod
at
sophia
and
exchange
smiles
with
mrs
enderby
they
proceeded
to
catches
at
last
and
when
people
really
fond
of
music
get
to
singing
catches
in
a
who
can
foresee
the
end
enslaver
cried
mr
enderby
you
must
know
enslaver
there
is
not
a
sweeter
catch
than
that
come
miss
ibbotson
begin
your
sister
will
follow
and
i
but
it
so
happened
that
miss
ibbotson
had
never
heard
enslaver
margaret
knew
it
she
believed
but
she
did
not
with
a
gay
eagerness
mr
enderby
turned
round
to
maria
saying
that
he
knew
she
could
sing
this
catch
and
everybody
was
aware
that
when
she
had
the
power
of
doing
a
kindness
she
never
wanted
the
will
he
remembered
that
she
could
sing
enslaver
he
might
well
remember
this
for
often
had
they
sung
it
together
while
several
of
the
company
were
saying
they
did
not
know
miss
young
could
sing
and
the
children
were
explaining
that
she
often
sang
at
her
work
mr
enderby
observed
some
signs
of
agitation
in
maria
and
hastened
to
say
you
had
rather
not
perhaps
pray
do
not
think
of
it
i
will
find
something
else
in
a
moment
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
very
inconsiderate
but
maria
thought
she
had
rather
not
accept
the
consideration
and
besides
the
children
were
anxious
that
she
should
sing
she
bore
her
part
in
a
way
which
made
mr
rowland
and
mrs
grey
agree
that
she
was
a
very
superior
young
woman
indeed
that
they
were
singularly
fortunate
to
have
secured
her
for
their
children
and
that
she
was
much
to
be
pitied
i
think
miss
young
has
got
a
little
cold
though
observed
sydney
her
voice
is
not
in
the
least
husky
when
she
sits
singing
here
by
father
look
there
there
are
all
the
servants
huddled
together
under
the
window
again
to
listen
to
the
singing
this
was
true
and
the
rain
was
over
it
was
presently
settled
that
the
schoolroom
should
be
evacuated
by
the
present
party
that
the
children
should
be
allowed
to
invite
the
servants
in
to
dispense
to
them
the
remains
of
the
feast
and
that
miss
young
must
favour
mrs
grey
with
her
company
this
evening
mr
rowland
was
obliged
to
return
home
to
business
but
before
his
friends
dispersed
he
must
just
say
that
mrs
rowland
and
he
had
never
for
a
moment
given
up
the
hope
of
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
them
at
dinner
in
the
dingleford
woods
and
as
the
rains
were
now
daily
abating
he
might
perhaps
be
allowed
to
name
wednesday
of
the
next
week
as
the
day
of
the
excursion
he
hoped
to
see
the
whole
of
the
present
company
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
bowing
as
he
spoke
to
mrs
enderby
and
to
his
own
little
daughter
anna
this
was
one
of
mr
rowland
pieces
of
independent
action
his
lady
had
given
him
no
commission
to
bring
the
affair
to
an
issue
and
he
returned
home
involuntarily
planning
what
kind
of
an
unconcerned
face
and
manner
he
should
put
on
while
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
chapter
ten
a
party
of
pleasure
mr
rowland
hoped
to
see
the
whole
of
the
present
company
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
this
was
the
best
part
of
his
speech
to
the
ears
of
the
children
it
made
an
impression
also
upon
some
others
two
or
three
days
afterwards
sydney
burst
laughing
into
the
where
his
mother
and
her
guests
were
at
work
to
tell
them
that
he
had
seen
mr
hope
riding
a
pony
in
the
oddest
way
in
the
lane
behind
his
lodgings
he
had
a
and
a
put
on
like
a
he
rode
the
pony
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
made
it
scramble
up
the
hill
behind
and
it
went
as
nicely
as
could
be
wherever
he
wanted
it
to
go
mr
hope
new
way
of
riding
was
easily
explained
the
next
time
he
called
miss
young
was
certainly
included
in
the
invitation
to
dingleford
woods
it
was
a
pity
she
should
not
go
and
she
could
not
walk
in
wild
places
the
pony
was
training
for
her
mrs
grey
quite
agreed
that
miss
young
ought
to
go
but
thought
that
mr
hope
was
giving
himself
much
needless
trouble
there
would
be
room
made
for
her
in
some
carriage
of
course
no
doubt
but
no
kind
of
carriage
could
make
its
way
in
the
woods
and
but
for
this
pony
miss
young
would
have
to
sit
in
a
carriage
or
under
a
tree
the
whole
time
that
the
rest
of
the
party
were
rambling
about
whereas
this
quiet
active
little
pony
would
take
care
that
she
was
nowhere
left
behind
it
could
do
everything
but
climb
trees
it
was
to
be
taken
over
to
dingleford
the
evening
before
and
would
be
waiting
for
its
rider
on
the
verge
of
the
woods
when
the
party
should
arrive
miss
young
was
touched
and
extremely
pleased
with
mr
hope
attention
in
the
days
of
her
prosperity
she
had
been
accustomed
to
ride
much
and
was
very
fond
of
it
but
since
her
misfortunes
she
had
never
once
been
in
the
saddle
lame
as
she
was
and
debarred
from
other
exercise
to
be
on
a
horse
again
and
among
the
woods
was
a
delicious
prospect
and
when
a
few
misgivings
had
been
reasoned
away
misgivings
about
being
troublesome
about
being
in
the
way
of
somebody
pleasure
or
convenience
maria
resigned
herself
to
the
full
expectation
of
a
most
delightful
day
if
the
weather
would
only
be
fine
the
children
would
be
there
and
they
were
always
willing
to
do
anything
for
her
sydney
would
guide
her
pony
in
case
of
need
or
show
her
where
she
might
stay
behind
by
herself
if
the
others
should
exhibit
a
passion
for
impracticable
places
she
knew
that
margaret
would
enjoy
the
day
all
the
more
for
her
being
there
and
so
would
mr
hope
as
he
had
amply
proved
maria
was
really
delighted
to
be
going
and
she
and
the
children
rejoiced
together
this
great
pleasure
involved
some
minor
enjoyments
too
in
the
way
of
preparation
on
sunday
mr
hope
told
her
that
he
believed
the
pony
was
now
fully
trained
but
he
should
like
that
she
should
try
it
especially
as
she
had
been
long
out
of
the
habit
of
riding
she
must
take
a
ride
with
him
on
monday
and
tuesday
afternoons
for
practice
the
ride
was
charming
through
verdon
woods
and
home
over
the
heath
from
crossley
end
the
circuit
which
was
to
have
been
three
miles
had
extended
to
ten
she
must
be
moderate
she
said
to
herself
the
next
day
and
not
let
mr
hope
spend
so
much
of
his
time
upon
her
and
besides
the
pony
had
to
be
sent
over
to
dingleford
in
the
evening
after
she
had
done
with
it
to
be
in
readiness
for
her
on
wednesday
morning
the
ride
on
tuesday
was
happily
accomplished
as
that
of
monday
but
it
was
much
shorter
mr
hope
agreed
that
it
should
be
short
as
he
had
a
patient
to
visit
on
the
dingleford
road
so
near
the
hamlet
that
he
might
as
well
take
the
pony
there
himself
it
would
trot
along
beside
his
horse
sydney
saved
him
part
of
the
charge
sydney
would
at
all
times
walk
back
any
distance
for
the
sake
of
a
ride
out
on
whatever
kind
of
saddle
or
almost
any
kind
of
quadruped
he
was
in
waiting
at
the
farrier
gate
when
miss
young
returned
from
her
ride
and
having
assisted
her
into
the
house
he
threw
himself
upon
her
pony
and
rode
three
miles
and
a
half
on
the
dingleford
road
before
he
would
dismount
and
deliver
his
bridle
into
mr
hope
hand
tea
was
over
and
the
removed
before
he
appeared
at
home
heated
and
delighted
with
his
expedition
he
ran
to
the
dairy
for
a
basin
of
milk
and
declared
that
his
being
hot
and
tired
did
not
matter
in
the
least
as
he
had
no
lessons
to
do
the
next
day
being
a
holiday
it
was
about
two
hours
after
this
when
hester
and
margaret
were
singing
to
sophia
playing
that
mr
grey
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
beckoned
mrs
grey
out
of
the
room
she
remained
absent
a
considerable
time
and
when
she
returned
the
singers
were
in
the
middle
of
another
duet
she
wandered
restlessly
about
the
room
till
the
piece
was
finished
and
then
made
a
sign
to
sophia
to
follow
her
into
the
storeroom
the
double
door
of
which
the
sisters
could
hear
carefully
closed
they
were
too
much
accustomed
to
the
appearance
of
mystery
among
the
ladies
of
the
grey
family
to
be
surprised
at
any
number
of
secret
conferences
which
might
take
place
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
evening
was
not
the
usual
time
for
these
the
family
practice
was
to
transact
all
private
consultations
in
the
morning
and
to
assemble
round
the
or
piano
after
tea
the
sisters
made
no
remark
to
each
other
on
the
present
occasion
but
continued
their
singing
each
supposing
that
the
conference
related
to
some
preparation
for
the
next
day
excursion
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
anything
in
the
room
before
their
hostess
it
margaret
was
playing
quadrilles
hester
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
the
shadows
which
the
risen
moon
was
flinging
across
the
field
and
the
lighting
up
of
mrs
enderby
parlour
behind
the
blinds
and
sydney
was
teasing
his
twin
sisters
with
rough
play
on
the
sofa
when
mrs
grey
returned
you
are
all
in
the
dark
said
she
in
a
particularly
grave
tone
why
did
you
not
ring
for
lights
my
dears
and
she
rang
immediately
be
quiet
children
i
will
not
have
you
make
so
much
noise
the
little
girls
seemed
to
wish
to
obey
but
their
brother
still
forced
them
to
giggle
and
their
struggling
entreaties
were
heard
now
do
sydney
now
pray
sydney
do
mary
and
fanny
go
to
bed
said
their
mother
decidedly
when
lights
were
brought
sydney
bid
your
cousins
and
then
come
with
me
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
already
mother
why
it
is
not
time
yet
this
it
is
enough
that
i
choose
you
to
go
to
bed
wish
your
cousins
and
come
with
me
mrs
grey
led
the
way
once
more
into
the
followed
rather
sulkily
by
sydney
what
can
all
this
be
about
whispered
hester
to
margaret
there
is
always
something
going
on
which
we
are
not
to
know
some
affair
of
fruit
or
wine
or
bonbons
perhaps
which
are
all
the
better
for
making
their
appearance
unexpectedly
at
this
moment
sophia
and
her
mother
entered
by
opposite
doors
sophia
eyes
were
red
and
there
was
every
promise
in
her
face
that
the
slightest
word
spoken
to
her
would
again
open
the
sluices
of
her
tears
mrs
grey
countenance
was
to
the
last
degree
dismal
but
she
talked
talked
industriously
of
everything
she
could
think
of
this
was
the
broadest
possible
hint
to
the
sisters
not
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
and
they
therefore
went
on
sewing
and
conversing
very
diligently
till
they
thought
they
might
relieve
mrs
grey
by
offering
to
retire
they
hesitated
only
because
mr
grey
had
not
come
in
and
he
so
regularly
appeared
at
ten
that
they
had
never
yet
retired
without
having
enjoyed
half
an
hour
chat
with
him
sophia
my
dear
said
her
mother
are
the
night
candles
there
light
your
cousins
i
am
sure
they
are
wishing
to
go
and
it
is
getting
late
you
will
not
see
mr
grey
my
dears
he
has
been
sent
for
to
a
distance
at
this
moment
the
scrambling
of
a
horse
feet
was
heard
on
the
gravel
before
the
front
door
sophia
looked
at
her
mother
and
each
lighted
a
candle
precipitately
and
thrust
it
into
a
hand
of
each
cousin
there
go
my
dears
said
mrs
grey
never
mind
stopping
for
mr
grey
i
will
deliver
your
to
him
you
will
have
to
be
rather
early
in
the
morning
you
know
thus
hester
and
margaret
were
hurried
while
the
front
door
was
in
the
act
of
being
unbarred
for
mr
grey
entrance
morris
was
despatched
after
them
with
equal
speed
by
mrs
grey
orders
and
she
reached
their
at
the
same
moment
that
they
did
hester
set
down
her
candle
bade
morris
shut
the
door
and
threw
herself
into
an
armchair
with
wonderful
decision
of
manner
declaring
that
she
had
never
been
so
treated
to
be
amused
and
sent
to
bed
like
a
baby
in
a
house
where
she
was
a
guest
i
am
afraid
something
is
the
matter
said
margaret
what
then
they
might
have
told
us
so
and
said
plainly
that
they
had
rather
be
alone
people
must
choose
their
own
ways
of
managing
their
own
affairs
you
know
and
what
those
ways
are
can
not
matter
to
us
as
long
as
we
are
not
offended
at
them
do
you
take
your
own
way
of
viewing
their
behaviour
then
and
leave
me
mine
said
hester
hastily
morris
feared
there
was
something
amiss
and
she
believed
alice
knew
what
it
was
but
she
had
not
told
either
cook
or
housemaid
a
syllable
about
it
by
morris
account
alice
had
been
playing
the
mysterious
in
the
kitchen
as
her
mistress
had
in
the
parlour
mr
grey
had
been
suddenly
sent
for
and
had
saddled
his
horse
himself
as
his
people
were
all
gone
and
there
was
no
one
on
the
premises
to
do
it
for
him
a
had
also
been
called
for
for
miss
sophia
whose
weeping
had
been
overheard
master
sydney
had
gone
to
his
room
very
cross
complaining
of
his
mother
having
questioned
him
overmuch
about
his
ride
and
then
sent
him
to
bed
half
an
hour
before
his
usual
time
a
deadly
fear
seized
upon
margaret
heart
when
she
heard
of
complaint
of
being
overmuch
questioned
about
his
ride
a
deadly
fear
for
hester
if
her
suspicion
should
prove
true
it
was
out
of
pure
consideration
that
they
had
been
amused
and
sent
to
bed
like
babies
a
glance
at
hester
showed
that
the
same
apprehension
had
crossed
her
mind
her
eyes
were
closed
for
a
moment
and
her
face
was
white
as
ashes
it
was
not
for
long
however
she
presently
said
with
decision
that
whatever
was
the
matter
it
must
be
some
entirely
private
affair
of
the
greys
if
any
accident
had
happened
to
any
one
in
the
village
if
bad
news
had
arrived
of
any
common
friend
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
secrecy
in
such
a
case
mrs
grey
would
have
given
herself
the
comfort
of
speaking
of
it
to
her
guests
it
must
certainly
be
some
entirely
private
some
family
hester
was
sincere
in
what
she
said
she
knew
so
little
of
the
state
of
her
own
heart
that
she
could
not
conceive
how
some
things
in
it
could
be
divined
or
speculated
upon
by
others
still
only
on
the
brink
of
the
discovery
that
she
loved
mr
hope
she
could
never
have
imagined
that
any
one
else
could
dream
of
such
a
thing
much
less
act
upon
it
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
letting
her
fears
now
point
for
a
moment
to
mr
hope
for
if
this
bad
news
had
related
to
him
her
sister
and
she
would
of
course
have
heard
of
it
the
next
moment
after
the
greys
margaret
caught
her
sister
meaning
and
strove
to
the
utmost
to
think
as
she
did
but
sydney
complaint
of
being
overmuch
questioned
about
his
ride
was
fatal
to
the
attempt
it
returned
upon
her
incessantly
during
the
night
and
when
towards
morning
she
slept
a
little
these
words
seemed
to
be
sounding
in
her
ear
all
the
while
before
undressing
both
she
and
hester
had
been
unable
to
resist
stepping
out
upon
the
stairs
to
watch
for
signs
whether
it
was
the
intention
of
the
family
to
sit
up
or
go
to
rest
all
had
retired
to
their
rooms
some
time
before
midnight
and
then
it
was
certain
that
nothing
more
could
be
learned
before
morning
each
sister
believed
that
the
other
slept
but
neither
could
be
sure
it
was
an
utterly
wretched
night
to
both
and
the
first
which
they
had
ever
passed
in
misery
without
speaking
to
each
other
suffering
was
all
from
apprehension
hester
was
little
alarmed
in
comparison
but
she
this
night
underwent
the
discovery
which
her
sister
had
made
some
little
time
ago
she
discovered
that
nothing
could
happen
to
her
so
dreadful
as
any
evil
befalling
mr
hope
she
discovered
that
he
was
more
to
her
than
the
sister
whom
she
could
have
declared
but
a
few
hours
before
to
be
the
dearest
on
earth
to
her
she
discovered
that
she
was
for
ever
humbled
in
her
own
eyes
that
her
had
received
an
incurable
wound
for
mr
hope
had
never
given
her
reason
to
regard
him
as
more
than
a
friend
during
the
weary
hours
of
this
night
she
revolved
every
conversation
every
act
of
intercourse
which
she
could
recall
and
from
all
that
she
could
remember
the
same
impression
resulted
that
mr
hope
was
a
friend
a
kind
and
sympathising
friend
interested
in
her
views
and
opinions
in
her
tastes
and
feelings
that
he
was
this
kind
friend
and
nothing
more
he
had
in
no
case
distinguished
her
from
her
sister
she
had
even
thought
at
times
that
margaret
had
been
the
more
important
of
the
two
to
him
that
might
be
from
her
own
jealous
temper
which
she
knew
was
apt
to
make
her
fancy
every
one
preferred
to
herself
but
she
thought
that
he
liked
margaret
best
as
she
was
sure
mr
enderby
did
whichever
way
she
looked
at
the
case
it
was
all
wretchedness
she
had
lost
her
and
and
she
was
miserable
the
first
rays
of
morning
have
a
wonderful
power
of
putting
to
flight
the
terrors
of
the
darkness
whether
their
causes
lie
without
us
or
within
when
the
first
beam
of
the
midsummer
sunshine
darted
into
the
chamber
through
the
leafy
limes
which
shaded
one
side
of
the
apartment
hester
mood
transiently
changed
there
was
a
brief
reaction
in
her
spirits
she
thought
she
had
been
making
herself
miserable
far
too
readily
the
mystery
of
the
preceding
evening
might
turn
out
a
trifle
she
had
been
thinking
too
seriously
about
her
own
fancies
if
she
had
really
been
discovering
a
great
and
sad
secret
about
herself
no
one
else
knew
it
nor
need
ever
know
it
she
could
command
herself
and
in
the
strength
of
pride
and
duty
she
would
do
so
all
was
not
lost
before
this
mood
had
passed
away
she
fell
asleep
with
prayer
in
her
heart
and
quiet
tears
upon
her
cheek
both
sisters
were
roused
from
their
brief
slumbers
by
a
loud
tapping
at
their
door
all
in
readiness
to
be
alarmed
margaret
sprang
up
and
was
at
the
door
to
know
who
was
there
it
is
us
it
is
we
fanny
and
mary
cousin
margaret
answered
the
twins
come
to
call
you
it
is
such
a
fine
morning
you
ca
think
papa
does
not
believe
we
shall
have
a
drop
of
rain
the
boy
has
just
carried
the
rolls
such
a
to
mrs
rowland
so
you
must
get
up
mamma
is
getting
up
already
the
sisters
were
vexed
to
have
been
thrown
into
a
terror
for
nothing
but
it
was
a
great
relief
to
find
mr
grey
prophesying
fine
weather
for
the
excursion
nothing
could
have
happened
to
cast
a
doubt
over
it
margaret
too
now
began
to
think
that
the
mystery
might
turn
out
a
trifle
and
she
threw
up
the
sash
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
with
a
gaiety
of
spirits
she
had
little
expected
to
feel
another
tap
at
the
door
it
was
morris
with
the
news
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
that
the
whole
house
was
astir
and
that
she
had
no
further
news
to
tell
another
tap
before
they
were
it
was
mrs
grey
with
a
face
quite
as
sorrowful
as
on
the
preceding
evening
and
the
peculiar
nervous
expression
about
the
mouth
which
served
her
instead
of
tears
have
you
done
with
morris
yet
my
dears
morris
you
may
go
said
hester
steadily
mrs
grey
gazed
at
her
with
a
mournful
inquisitiveness
while
she
spoke
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
hester
throughout
though
what
she
said
seemed
addressed
to
both
sisters
there
is
something
the
matter
mrs
grey
continued
hester
calmly
say
what
it
is
you
had
better
have
told
us
last
night
i
thought
it
best
not
to
break
your
sleep
my
dears
we
always
think
bad
news
is
best
told
in
the
morning
tell
us
said
margaret
hester
quietly
seated
herself
on
the
bed
it
concerns
our
valued
friend
mr
hope
said
mrs
grey
colour
had
been
going
from
the
moment
mrs
grey
entered
the
room
it
was
now
quite
gone
but
she
preserved
her
calmness
he
was
safe
when
sydney
lost
sight
of
him
on
the
ridge
of
the
hill
on
the
dingleford
road
but
he
afterwards
had
an
accident
what
kind
of
accident
inquired
margaret
is
he
killed
asked
hester
no
not
killed
he
was
found
insensible
in
the
road
the
miller
boy
observed
his
horse
without
a
rider
plunge
into
the
river
below
the
dam
and
swim
across
and
another
person
saw
the
pony
sydney
had
been
riding
grazing
with
a
on
on
the
common
this
made
them
search
and
they
found
mr
hope
lying
in
the
road
insensible
as
i
told
you
what
is
thought
of
his
state
asked
margaret
two
medical
men
were
called
immediately
from
the
nearest
places
and
mr
grey
saw
them
last
night
for
the
news
reached
us
while
you
were
at
the
piano
and
we
thought
yes
but
what
do
the
medical
men
say
they
do
not
speak
very
favourably
it
is
a
concussion
of
the
brain
they
declare
the
case
is
not
hopeless
and
that
is
all
they
can
say
he
has
not
spoken
yet
only
just
opened
his
eyes
but
we
are
assured
the
case
is
not
quite
desperate
so
we
must
hope
for
the
best
i
am
glad
the
case
is
not
desperate
said
hester
he
would
be
a
great
loss
to
you
all
mrs
grey
looked
at
her
in
amazement
and
then
at
margaret
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
comprehended
and
respected
the
effort
her
sister
was
making
oh
mrs
grey
said
margaret
must
we
go
surely
it
is
no
time
for
an
excursion
of
pleasure
that
must
be
as
you
feel
disposed
my
dears
it
would
annoy
mrs
rowland
very
much
to
have
the
party
broken
up
so
much
so
that
some
of
us
must
go
but
my
young
people
will
do
their
best
to
fill
your
places
if
you
feel
yourselves
unequal
to
the
exertion
she
looked
at
hester
as
she
spoke
oh
if
anybody
goes
we
go
of
course
said
hester
i
think
you
are
quite
right
in
supposing
that
the
business
of
the
day
must
proceed
if
there
was
anything
to
be
done
by
staying
at
home
if
you
could
make
us
of
any
use
mrs
grey
it
would
be
a
different
thing
but
well
if
there
is
nothing
in
your
feelings
which
if
you
believe
yourselves
equal
to
the
exertion
margaret
now
interposed
one
had
rather
stay
at
home
and
be
quiet
when
one
is
anxious
about
one
friends
but
other
people
must
be
considered
as
we
seem
to
be
agreed
mr
and
mrs
rowland
and
all
the
children
so
we
will
proceed
with
our
dressing
mrs
grey
but
can
you
tell
us
before
you
go
how
soon
how
soon
we
shall
know
when
this
case
will
probably
be
decided
it
might
be
a
few
hours
or
it
might
be
many
days
mrs
grey
said
she
should
stay
at
home
in
case
of
anything
being
sent
for
from
the
farmhouse
where
mr
hope
was
lying
he
was
well
attended
in
the
hands
of
good
nurses
former
patients
of
his
own
but
something
might
be
wanted
and
orders
had
been
left
by
mr
grey
that
application
should
be
made
to
his
house
for
whatever
could
be
of
service
so
mrs
grey
could
not
think
of
leaving
home
mr
grey
would
make
inquiry
at
the
farmhouse
as
the
party
went
by
to
the
woods
and
he
would
just
turn
his
horse
back
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
inquire
again
and
thus
the
rowlands
party
would
know
more
of
mr
hope
state
than
those
who
remained
at
home
having
explained
mrs
grey
quitted
the
room
somewhat
disappointed
that
hester
had
received
the
disclosure
so
well
the
moment
the
door
was
closed
hester
sank
forward
on
the
bed
her
face
hidden
but
her
trembling
betraying
her
emotion
i
feared
this
said
margaret
looking
mournfully
at
her
sister
you
feared
what
asked
hester
quickly
looking
up
i
feared
that
some
accident
had
happened
to
mr
hope
so
did
i
and
if
said
margaret
i
feared
something
else
nay
hester
you
must
let
me
speak
we
must
have
no
concealments
hester
you
and
i
are
alone
in
the
world
and
we
must
comfort
each
other
we
agreed
to
this
why
should
you
be
ashamed
of
what
you
feel
i
believe
that
you
have
a
stronger
interest
in
this
misfortune
than
any
one
in
the
world
and
why
how
do
you
mean
a
stronger
interest
asked
hester
trying
to
command
her
voice
tell
me
what
you
mean
margaret
i
mean
said
margaret
steadily
that
no
one
is
so
much
attached
to
mr
hope
as
you
are
i
think
said
margaret
after
a
pause
that
mr
hope
has
a
high
respect
and
strong
regard
for
you
she
paused
again
and
then
added
if
i
believed
anything
more
i
would
tell
you
when
hester
could
speak
again
she
said
gently
and
humbly
i
assure
you
margaret
i
never
knew
the
state
of
my
own
mind
till
this
last
night
if
i
had
been
aware
if
you
had
been
aware
you
would
have
been
unlike
all
who
ever
really
loved
if
people
say
true
now
that
you
have
become
aware
you
will
act
as
you
act
nobly
righteously
you
will
struggle
with
your
feelings
till
your
mind
grows
calm
peace
will
come
in
time
do
you
think
there
is
no
hope
consider
his
state
but
if
he
should
recover
oh
margaret
how
wicked
all
this
is
while
he
lies
there
we
are
grieving
about
me
what
a
selfish
wretch
i
am
margaret
had
nothing
to
reply
there
seemed
so
much
truth
in
this
even
she
reproached
herself
with
being
exclusively
anxious
about
her
sister
when
such
a
friend
might
be
dying
when
a
life
of
such
importance
to
many
was
in
jeopardy
i
could
do
anything
i
could
bear
anything
said
hester
if
i
could
be
sure
that
nobody
knew
but
you
found
me
out
margaret
and
perhaps
i
assure
you
i
believe
you
are
safe
said
margaret
you
can
hide
nothing
from
me
but
mrs
grey
and
nobody
except
myself
has
watched
you
like
mrs
grey
has
gone
away
i
am
certain
completely
deceived
but
hester
my
own
precious
sister
bear
with
one
word
from
me
do
not
trust
too
much
to
your
pride
i
do
trust
to
pride
and
i
will
replied
hester
her
cheeks
in
a
glow
do
you
suppose
i
will
allow
all
in
this
house
all
in
the
village
to
be
pitying
me
to
be
watching
how
i
suffer
when
no
one
supposes
that
he
gave
me
cause
it
is
not
to
be
endured
even
in
the
bare
thought
no
if
you
do
not
betray
me
i
betray
you
well
well
i
know
you
will
not
and
then
i
am
safe
pride
i
can
trust
to
and
i
will
it
will
betray
you
sighed
margaret
i
do
not
want
you
to
parade
your
sorrow
god
knows
it
will
be
better
borne
in
quiet
and
secrecy
what
i
wish
for
you
is
that
you
should
receive
this
otherwise
than
as
a
punishment
a
disgrace
in
your
own
eyes
for
something
wrong
you
have
done
nothing
wrong
nothing
that
you
may
not
appeal
to
god
to
help
you
to
endure
take
it
as
a
sorrow
sent
by
him
to
be
meekly
borne
as
what
no
earthly
person
has
any
concern
with
be
superior
to
the
opinions
of
the
people
about
us
instead
of
defying
them
pride
will
give
you
no
peace
resignation
will
i
am
too
selfish
for
this
sighed
hester
i
hate
myself
margaret
i
have
not
even
the
grace
to
love
except
for
my
own
sake
and
while
he
is
dying
i
am
planning
to
save
my
pride
i
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
me
come
margaret
let
us
dress
and
go
down
do
not
trouble
your
kind
heart
about
me
i
am
not
worth
it
this
mood
gave
way
a
little
to
margaret
grief
and
endearments
but
hester
issued
from
her
chamber
for
the
day
in
a
state
of
towering
pride
secretly
alternating
with
the
anguish
of
it
was
a
miserable
day
as
wretched
a
party
of
pleasure
as
could
be
imagined
mrs
rowland
was
occupied
in
thinking
and
occasionally
saying
how
strangely
everything
fell
out
to
torment
her
how
something
always
occurred
to
cross
every
plan
of
hers
she
talked
about
this
to
her
mother
sophia
and
hester
who
were
in
the
barouche
with
her
till
the
whole
cavalcade
stopped
just
before
reaching
the
farmhouse
where
mr
hope
lay
and
to
which
mr
grey
rode
on
to
make
inquiries
margaret
was
with
mr
rowland
in
his
gig
it
was
a
breathless
three
minutes
till
mr
grey
brought
the
news
margaret
wondered
how
hester
was
bearing
it
it
would
have
pleased
her
to
have
known
that
mrs
rowland
was
holding
forth
so
strenuously
upon
her
disappointment
about
a
dress
at
the
last
buckley
ball
and
about
her
children
having
had
the
measles
on
the
only
occasion
when
mr
rowland
could
have
taken
her
to
the
races
in
the
next
county
that
hester
might
sit
in
silence
and
bear
the
suspense
unobserved
mr
grey
reappeared
quite
as
soon
as
he
could
be
looked
for
there
might
have
been
worse
news
mr
hope
was
no
longer
in
a
stupor
he
was
delirious
his
medical
attendants
could
not
pronounce
any
judgment
upon
the
case
further
than
that
it
was
not
hopeless
they
had
known
recovery
in
similar
cases
as
mr
grey
bore
his
report
from
carriage
to
carriage
every
one
strove
to
speak
cheerfully
and
to
make
the
best
of
the
case
and
those
who
were
not
the
most
interested
really
satisfied
themselves
with
the
truth
that
the
tidings
were
better
than
they
might
have
been
the
damp
upon
the
spirits
of
the
party
was
most
evident
when
all
had
descended
from
the
carriages
and
were
collected
in
the
woods
there
was
a
general
tremor
about
accidents
if
one
of
the
gentlemen
had
gone
forward
to
explore
or
the
children
had
lagged
behind
for
play
there
was
a
shouting
and
a
general
stop
till
the
missing
party
appeared
miss
young
would
fain
have
declined
her
pony
which
was
duly
in
waiting
for
her
it
was
only
because
she
felt
that
no
individual
could
well
be
spared
from
the
party
that
she
mounted
at
all
mr
hope
was
to
have
had
the
charge
of
her
and
though
she
had
requested
sydney
to
take
his
place
as
far
as
was
necessary
mr
enderby
insisted
on
doing
so
a
circumstance
which
did
not
add
to
her
satisfaction
she
was
not
altogether
so
as
her
friends
the
ibbotsons
but
even
to
her
everything
was
weariness
of
spirit
the
landscape
seemed
dull
the
splendid
dinner
on
the
grass
tiresome
the
sunshine
sickly
and
even
the
children
with
their
laughter
and
practical
jokes
fatiguing
and
troublesome
even
she
could
easily
have
spoken
sharply
to
each
and
all
of
the
little
ones
if
she
felt
so
what
must
the
day
have
been
to
hester
she
bore
up
well
under
any
observation
that
she
might
suppose
herself
the
object
of
but
margaret
saw
how
laboriously
she
strove
and
in
vain
to
eat
how
welcome
was
the
glass
of
wine
how
mechanical
her
singing
after
dinner
and
how
impatient
she
was
of
sitting
still
the
strangest
thing
was
to
see
her
walking
in
a
dim
glade
in
the
afternoon
with
mrs
rowland
as
if
in
the
most
confidential
conversation
mrs
rowland
apparently
offering
the
confidence
and
hester
receiving
it
look
at
them
said
mr
enderby
who
would
believe
that
my
sister
prohibited
solitary
walks
and
only
three
hours
ago
on
the
ground
that
every
one
ought
to
be
sociable
i
shall
go
and
break
up
the
conference
pray
do
not
said
margaret
let
them
forget
rules
and
pass
their
time
as
they
like
best
oh
but
here
is
news
of
hope
mr
grey
has
now
brought
word
that
he
is
no
worse
i
begin
to
think
he
may
get
through
which
god
knows
i
had
no
idea
of
this
morning
do
you
really
think
so
but
do
not
tell
other
people
unless
you
are
quite
confident
that
you
really
mean
what
you
say
i
may
be
wrong
of
course
but
i
do
think
the
chances
improve
with
every
hour
that
he
does
not
get
worse
and
he
is
certainly
not
worse
i
have
a
strong
presentiment
that
he
will
struggle
through
go
then
and
tell
as
many
people
as
you
choose
only
make
them
understand
how
much
is
presentiment
the
between
the
ladies
being
broken
off
by
mr
enderby
with
his
tidings
was
not
renewed
hester
walked
beside
miss
pony
her
cheek
flushed
and
her
eye
bright
margaret
thought
there
was
pride
underneath
and
not
merely
the
excitement
of
renewed
hope
so
feeble
as
that
hope
must
yet
be
and
so
nearly
crushed
by
suspense
before
the
hour
fixed
for
the
carriages
to
be
in
readiness
the
party
had
given
up
all
pretence
of
amusing
themselves
and
each
other
they
sat
on
a
ridge
watching
the
spot
where
the
vehicles
were
to
assemble
and
message
after
message
was
sent
to
the
servants
to
desire
them
to
make
haste
the
general
wish
seemed
to
be
to
be
getting
home
though
the
sun
was
yet
some
way
from
its
setting
when
the
first
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
hester
whispered
to
her
sister
i
can
not
be
in
the
same
carriage
with
that
woman
no
you
must
not
either
i
can
not
now
tell
you
why
i
dare
say
miss
young
would
take
my
place
and
let
me
go
with
the
children
in
the
waggon
i
will
do
that
and
you
shall
return
in
mr
rowland
gig
you
can
talk
or
not
as
you
please
with
him
and
he
is
very
kind
he
is
no
more
to
be
blamed
for
his
wife
behaviour
you
know
than
her
mother
or
her
brother
it
shall
be
so
i
will
manage
it
margaret
could
manage
what
she
pleased
with
maria
and
mr
enderby
both
devoted
to
her
hester
was
off
with
mr
rowland
and
margaret
with
one
child
on
her
lap
and
the
others
rejoicing
at
having
possession
of
her
before
mrs
rowland
discovered
the
shifting
of
parties
which
had
taken
place
often
during
the
ride
she
wanted
to
speak
to
her
brother
three
times
out
of
four
he
was
not
to
be
had
so
busy
was
he
joking
with
the
children
as
he
trotted
his
horse
beside
the
waggon
and
when
he
did
hear
his
sister
call
he
merely
answered
her
questions
said
something
to
make
his
mother
laugh
and
dropped
into
his
place
beside
the
waggon
again
it
struck
maria
that
the
waggon
had
not
been
such
an
attraction
in
going
though
the
flowers
with
which
it
was
canopied
had
then
been
fresh
and
the
children
more
merry
and
than
now
the
report
to
be
carried
home
to
deerbrook
was
that
mr
hope
was
still
no
worse
it
was
thought
that
his
delirium
was
somewhat
quieter
mrs
grey
was
out
on
the
steps
to
hear
the
news
when
the
carriage
approached
as
it
happened
the
gig
arrived
first
and
hester
had
to
give
the
relation
she
spoke
even
cheerfully
declaring
mr
opinion
that
the
case
was
going
on
favourably
and
that
recovery
was
very
possible
mrs
grey
who
had
had
a
wretchedly
anxious
day
by
herself
not
having
enjoyed
even
the
satisfaction
of
being
useful
nothing
having
been
sent
for
from
the
farmhouse
was
truly
cheered
by
seeing
her
family
about
her
again
i
have
been
watching
for
you
this
hour
said
she
and
yet
i
hardly
expected
you
so
soon
as
it
grew
late
i
began
to
fancy
all
manner
of
accidents
that
might
befall
you
when
one
accident
happens
it
makes
one
fancy
so
many
more
i
could
not
help
thinking
about
mr
horse
does
that
horse
seem
to
you
perfectly
steady
hester
well
i
am
glad
of
it
but
i
once
saw
it
shy
from
some
linen
on
a
hedge
and
it
was
in
my
mind
all
this
afternoon
here
you
are
all
safe
however
and
i
trust
we
may
feel
more
cheerfully
now
about
our
good
friend
if
he
goes
on
to
grow
better
i
shall
get
mr
grey
to
drive
me
over
soon
to
see
him
but
my
dears
what
will
you
have
after
your
ride
shall
i
order
tea
or
will
you
have
something
more
substantial
tea
if
you
please
said
hester
her
tongue
was
parched
and
when
margaret
followed
her
she
found
her
drinking
water
as
if
she
had
been
three
days
deep
in
the
great
desert
can
you
tell
me
now
asked
margaret
what
mrs
rowland
has
been
saying
to
you
no
not
at
present
better
wait
margaret
what
do
you
think
now
i
think
that
all
looks
brighter
than
it
did
this
morning
but
what
a
wretched
day
it
has
been
you
found
it
so
did
you
oh
margaret
i
have
longed
every
hour
to
lie
down
to
sleep
in
that
wood
and
never
wake
again
i
do
not
wonder
but
you
will
soon
feel
better
the
sleep
from
which
you
will
wake
morning
will
do
nearly
as
well
we
must
sleep
and
hope
for
good
news
in
the
morning
no
good
news
will
ever
come
to
me
again
sighed
hester
no
no
i
do
not
quite
mean
that
you
need
not
look
at
me
so
it
is
ungrateful
to
say
such
a
thing
at
this
moment
come
i
am
ready
to
go
down
to
tea
it
is
really
getting
dark
i
thought
this
day
never
would
come
to
an
end
the
evening
was
wearisome
enough
mrs
grey
asked
how
mrs
rowland
had
behaved
and
sophia
was
beginning
to
tell
when
her
father
checked
her
reminding
her
that
she
had
been
enjoying
mrs
rowland
hospitality
this
was
all
he
said
but
it
was
enough
to
bring
on
one
of
interminable
fits
of
crying
the
children
were
cross
with
fatigue
mrs
grey
thought
her
husband
hard
upon
sophia
and
to
complete
the
absurdity
of
the
scene
hester
and
margaret
tears
proved
uncontrollable
the
sight
of
sophia
set
them
flowing
and
though
they
laughed
at
themselves
for
the
folly
of
weeping
from
mere
sympathy
this
did
not
mend
the
matter
mrs
grey
seemed
on
the
verge
of
tears
herself
when
she
observed
that
she
had
expected
a
cheerful
evening
after
a
lonely
and
anxious
day
a
deep
sob
from
the
three
answered
to
this
observation
and
they
all
rose
to
go
to
their
apartments
hester
was
struck
by
the
peculiar
tender
pressure
of
the
hand
given
her
by
mr
grey
as
she
offered
him
her
mute
it
caused
her
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
when
she
reached
her
own
room
margaret
was
determined
not
to
go
to
rest
without
knowing
what
it
was
that
mrs
rowland
had
said
to
her
sister
she
pressed
for
it
now
hoping
that
it
would
rouse
hester
from
more
painful
thoughts
though
i
have
been
enjoying
that
woman
hospitality
as
mr
grey
says
declared
hester
i
must
speak
of
her
as
i
think
to
you
oh
she
has
been
so
insolent
insolent
to
you
how
why
nay
you
had
better
ask
her
why
her
confidence
was
all
about
her
brother
she
seems
to
think
she
did
not
say
so
or
i
should
have
known
better
how
to
answer
her
but
she
seems
to
think
that
her
brother
is
i
can
hardly
speak
it
even
to
you
margaret
is
in
some
way
in
danger
from
me
now
you
and
i
know
that
he
cares
no
more
for
me
than
for
any
one
of
the
people
who
were
there
and
yet
she
went
on
telling
me
and
i
could
not
stop
her
about
the
views
of
his
family
for
him
what
views
views
which
i
imagine
it
by
no
means
follows
that
he
has
for
himself
if
she
has
been
impertinent
to
me
she
has
been
even
more
so
to
him
i
wonder
how
she
dares
meddle
in
his
concerns
as
she
does
well
but
what
views
persisted
margaret
oh
about
his
marrying
that
he
is
the
darling
of
his
family
that
large
family
interests
hang
upon
his
marrying
that
all
his
relations
think
it
is
time
he
was
settling
and
that
he
told
her
last
week
that
he
was
of
that
opinion
himself
and
then
she
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
the
most
delightful
accordance
in
their
views
for
him
that
they
did
not
much
value
beauty
that
they
should
require
for
him
something
of
a
far
higher
order
than
beauty
and
which
indeed
was
seldom
found
with
it
insolent
creature
did
she
say
that
to
you
indeed
she
did
and
that
her
brother
wife
must
be
of
a
good
family
with
a
fortune
worthy
of
his
own
and
naturally
of
a
county
family
a
county
family
said
margaret
half
laughing
what
matters
county
or
city
when
two
people
are
watching
over
one
another
for
life
and
death
and
for
hereafter
with
such
people
as
mrs
rowland
said
hester
marriage
is
a
very
superficial
affair
if
family
fortune
and
equipage
are
but
right
the
rest
may
be
left
to
providence
temper
mind
heart
the
worst
of
all
however
was
her
ending
or
what
was
made
her
ending
by
our
being
interrupted
well
what
was
her
finish
she
put
her
face
almost
under
my
bonnet
as
she
looked
smiling
at
me
and
said
there
was
a
young
lady
she
wished
she
could
tell
me
all
about
it
the
time
would
come
when
she
might
there
was
a
sweet
girl
beloved
by
them
all
for
many
years
from
her
very
childhood
whom
they
had
hopes
of
receiving
at
no
very
distant
time
as
philip
wife
i
do
not
believe
it
cried
margaret
after
a
pause
she
added
do
you
believe
it
hester
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
i
should
not
rate
mrs
rowland
word
very
highly
but
this
would
be
such
a
prodigious
falsehood
it
is
possible
however
that
she
may
believe
it
without
its
being
true
or
such
a
woman
might
make
the
most
for
the
occasion
of
a
mere
suspicion
of
her
own
i
do
not
believe
it
is
true
repeated
margaret
at
all
events
concluded
hester
nothing
that
mrs
rowland
says
is
worth
regarding
i
was
foolish
to
let
myself
be
ruffled
by
her
margaret
tried
to
take
the
lesson
home
but
it
was
in
vain
she
was
ruffled
and
in
spite
of
every
effort
she
did
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
nameless
young
lady
it
had
been
a
day
of
trouble
and
thus
was
it
ending
in
fresh
sorrow
and
fear
morris
came
in
hesitated
at
the
door
was
told
she
might
stay
and
immediately
busied
herself
in
the
brushing
of
hair
and
the
folding
of
clothes
many
tears
trickled
down
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
till
all
the
offices
of
the
toilet
were
finished
morris
then
asked
with
a
glance
at
the
whether
she
should
go
or
stay
stay
morris
said
hester
gently
you
shall
not
suffer
for
our
being
unhappy
margaret
will
you
can
you
read
margaret
took
the
volume
in
which
it
was
the
sisters
common
practice
to
read
together
and
with
morris
at
night
while
morris
took
her
seat
and
reverently
composed
herself
to
hear
margaret
turned
to
the
words
which
have
stilled
many
a
tempest
of
grief
from
the
moment
when
they
were
first
uttered
to
mourners
through
a
long
course
of
centuries
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
believe
in
god
believe
in
me
morris
sometimes
spoke
on
these
occasions
she
loved
to
hear
of
the
many
mansions
in
the
house
of
the
father
of
all
and
she
said
that
though
it
might
seem
to
her
young
ladies
that
their
parents
had
gone
there
full
soon
leaving
them
to
undergo
trouble
by
themselves
yet
she
had
no
doubt
they
should
all
be
at
peace
together
sooner
or
later
and
their
passing
troubles
seem
as
nothing
even
this
simple
and
obvious
remark
roused
courage
in
the
sisters
they
remembered
what
their
father
had
said
to
them
about
his
leaving
them
to
encounter
the
serious
business
and
trials
of
life
and
how
they
had
promised
to
strive
to
be
wise
and
trustful
and
to
help
each
other
this
day
the
serious
business
and
trials
of
life
had
manifestly
begun
they
must
strengthen
themselves
and
each
other
to
meet
them
they
agreed
upon
this
and
in
a
mood
of
faith
and
resolution
fell
asleep
chapter
eleven
mediation
mr
hope
case
turned
out
more
favourably
than
any
of
his
attendants
and
friends
had
ventured
to
anticipate
for
some
days
the
symptoms
continued
as
alarming
as
at
first
but
from
the
hour
that
he
began
to
amend
his
progress
towards
recovery
was
without
drawback
and
unusually
rapid
within
a
month
the
news
circulated
through
the
village
that
he
had
been
safely
brought
home
to
his
own
lodgings
and
the
day
after
the
ladies
at
mr
grey
were
startled
by
seeing
him
alight
from
a
gig
at
the
door
and
walk
up
the
steps
feebly
but
without
assistance
he
could
not
stay
away
any
longer
he
declared
he
had
been
above
a
month
shut
up
in
a
dim
room
without
seeing
any
faces
but
of
doctor
nurse
and
mrs
grey
and
debarred
from
books
now
he
was
well
enough
to
prescribe
for
himself
and
he
was
sure
that
a
little
society
and
a
gradual
return
to
his
usual
habits
of
life
would
do
him
more
good
than
anything
mrs
grey
kept
all
her
own
children
out
of
sight
during
this
first
visit
that
mr
hope
might
not
see
too
many
faces
at
once
she
admitted
only
hester
and
margaret
and
alice
who
brought
him
some
refreshment
the
girl
made
him
a
low
curtsey
and
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
awe
and
pleasure
which
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
even
her
mistress
mr
hope
had
been
a
benefactor
to
this
girl
he
had
brought
her
through
a
fever
she
had
of
late
little
expected
ever
to
see
him
again
mr
hope
replied
to
her
mute
looks
thank
you
alice
i
am
much
better
i
hope
to
be
quite
well
soon
did
not
you
make
some
of
the
good
things
mrs
grey
has
been
kind
enough
to
bring
me
i
thought
so
well
i
much
obliged
to
you
and
to
everybody
who
has
been
taking
pains
to
make
me
well
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
he
continued
when
alice
had
left
the
room
but
things
do
not
appear
as
they
used
to
do
perhaps
my
eyes
are
dim
still
but
the
room
does
not
seem
bright
and
none
of
you
look
well
and
merry
mrs
grey
observed
that
she
had
drawn
the
blinds
down
thinking
he
would
find
it
a
relief
after
the
sunshine
margaret
said
ingenuously
we
are
all
well
i
assure
you
but
you
should
not
wonder
if
you
find
us
rather
grave
much
has
happened
since
we
met
we
have
been
thinking
of
you
with
great
anxiety
for
so
long
that
we
can
not
on
a
sudden
talk
as
lightly
as
when
you
used
to
come
in
every
day
ah
said
he
i
little
thought
at
one
time
that
i
should
ever
see
any
of
you
again
in
this
world
we
have
thought
of
you
as
near
death
said
margaret
and
since
that
as
having
a
experience
which
we
respect
and
stand
in
awe
of
and
that
is
reason
enough
for
our
looking
grave
you
feel
as
if
you
had
to
become
acquainted
with
me
over
again
well
we
must
lose
no
time
here
is
a
month
gone
that
i
can
give
no
account
of
hester
felt
how
differently
the
case
stood
with
her
the
last
month
had
been
the
longest
she
had
ever
known
tedious
as
to
the
state
captive
serving
his
noviciate
to
prison
life
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
say
that
she
could
give
no
account
of
the
past
month
she
inquired
how
the
accident
happened
for
this
was
still
a
mystery
to
everybody
mr
hope
could
not
clear
up
the
matter
he
remembered
parting
with
sydney
and
trotting
with
the
bridle
of
the
pony
in
his
hand
to
the
top
of
the
ascent
the
point
where
sydney
lost
sight
of
him
he
had
no
distinct
remembrance
of
anything
more
only
a
sort
of
impression
of
his
horse
rearing
bolt
upright
he
had
never
been
thrown
before
and
his
supposition
was
that
a
stone
cast
from
behind
the
hedge
might
have
struck
his
horse
but
he
really
knew
no
more
of
the
affair
than
any
one
else
the
ladies
all
trusted
he
would
not
ride
the
same
horse
again
but
this
he
would
not
promise
his
horse
was
an
old
friend
and
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
to
part
with
old
friends
he
was
glad
to
find
that
miss
young
had
not
laid
the
blame
on
the
pony
but
had
ridden
it
through
the
woods
as
if
nothing
had
happened
not
exactly
so
said
margaret
smiling
the
young
folks
did
not
enjoy
their
excursion
very
much
i
fancy
said
mrs
grey
smiling
also
mrs
rowland
was
quite
put
out
poor
soul
you
know
she
thinks
everything
goes
wrong
on
purpose
to
plague
her
i
think
she
had
some
higher
feelings
on
that
occasion
said
mr
hope
gently
but
gravely
i
am
indebted
to
her
for
a
very
anxious
concern
on
my
account
and
for
kind
offices
in
which
perhaps
none
of
my
many
generous
friends
have
surpassed
her
mrs
grey
somewhat
abashed
said
that
mrs
rowland
had
some
good
qualities
it
was
only
a
pity
that
her
unhappy
temper
did
not
allow
them
fair
play
it
is
a
pity
observed
mr
hope
and
it
is
at
the
same
time
an
appeal
to
us
to
allow
her
the
fair
play
she
does
not
afford
herself
that
sofa
looks
delightfully
comfortable
mrs
grey
oh
you
are
tired
you
are
faint
perhaps
shall
i
ring
said
hester
moving
to
the
bell
no
no
said
he
laughing
i
am
very
well
at
present
i
only
mean
that
i
should
like
to
stay
all
day
if
you
will
let
me
i
am
sure
that
sofa
is
full
as
comfortable
as
my
own
i
may
stay
may
i
not
no
indeed
you
shall
not
this
first
day
if
you
will
go
away
now
before
you
are
tired
and
if
i
find
when
i
look
in
upon
you
this
evening
that
you
are
not
the
worse
for
this
feat
you
shall
stay
longer
but
i
assure
you
it
is
time
you
were
at
home
now
my
dears
just
see
whether
the
gig
is
at
the
door
so
i
only
get
sent
away
by
begging
to
stay
said
mr
hope
well
i
have
been
giving
orders
to
sick
people
for
so
many
years
that
i
suppose
it
is
fairly
my
turn
to
obey
now
may
i
ask
you
to
send
to
widow
i
looked
in
as
i
came
and
her
child
is
in
want
of
better
food
better
cooked
than
she
is
able
to
give
him
i
will
send
him
a
dinner
from
our
table
you
are
not
going
to
see
any
more
patients
i
hope
only
two
that
lie
quite
in
my
road
if
you
send
me
away
you
must
take
the
consequences
farewell
till
tomorrow
mr
grey
and
i
shall
look
in
upon
you
this
evening
now
do
not
look
about
you
out
of
doors
to
catch
anybody
eye
or
you
will
be
visiting
a
dozen
patients
between
this
house
and
your
own
there
were
indeed
many
people
standing
about
within
sight
of
mr
grey
door
to
see
mr
hope
come
out
all
mr
grey
children
and
servants
were
peeping
through
the
shrubbery
mrs
enderby
waved
her
hand
from
a
lower
and
her
two
maids
looked
out
from
an
upper
window
the
old
man
of
a
hundred
years
who
was
sunning
himself
on
the
bank
as
usual
rose
and
took
off
his
hat
and
the
little
reeves
and
their
schoolfellows
stood
whispering
to
one
another
that
mr
hope
looked
rarely
bad
still
mrs
plumstead
dropped
a
low
curtsey
as
she
stood
taking
in
the
at
her
distant
door
mrs
grey
observed
to
hester
on
the
respect
which
was
paid
to
mr
hope
all
through
the
place
as
if
hester
was
not
feeling
it
in
her
heart
of
hearts
at
the
moment
mrs
grey
flattered
herself
that
mr
hope
was
thinking
of
hester
when
he
said
his
friends
did
not
look
well
she
had
been
growing
thinner
and
paler
for
the
last
month
and
no
doubt
remained
in
mrs
grey
mind
about
the
cause
hester
had
commanded
herself
to
her
admiration
but
she
could
not
command
her
health
and
that
was
giving
way
under
perpetual
feelings
of
anxiety
and
humiliation
mrs
grey
thought
all
this
had
gone
quite
far
enough
she
was
more
fond
and
proud
of
hester
every
day
and
more
impatient
that
she
should
be
happy
the
more
she
watched
her
she
spoke
to
margaret
about
her
margaret
was
prepared
for
this
having
foreseen
its
probability
and
her
answers
while
perfectly
true
and
sincere
were
so
guarded
that
mrs
grey
drew
from
them
the
comfortable
inference
that
she
alone
penetrated
the
matter
and
understood
hester
state
of
mind
she
came
to
the
resolution
at
last
of
making
the
young
people
happy
a
little
sooner
than
they
could
have
managed
the
affair
for
themselves
she
would
help
them
to
an
understanding
but
it
should
be
with
all
possible
delicacy
and
regard
to
their
feelings
not
even
mr
grey
should
know
what
she
was
about
opportunities
were
not
wanting
when
are
opportunities
wanting
to
if
such
do
not
find
means
of
carrying
their
points
they
can
construct
them
few
go
to
work
so
innocently
and
securely
as
mrs
grey
for
few
can
be
so
certain
of
the
inclinations
of
the
parties
as
she
believed
herself
her
own
admiration
of
hester
was
so
exclusive
and
the
superiority
of
hester
beauty
so
unquestionable
that
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
attraction
which
drew
mr
hope
to
the
house
could
be
any
other
than
this
about
the
state
of
affections
she
felt
justly
confident
and
so
in
her
view
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
save
her
from
further
pining
by
bringing
about
an
explanation
she
was
frequently
with
mr
hope
at
his
lodgings
during
his
recovery
seeing
that
he
took
his
afternoon
rest
and
beguiling
a
part
of
his
evenings
in
short
watching
over
him
as
over
a
son
and
declaring
to
hester
that
he
was
no
less
dear
to
her
one
evening
when
she
was
spending
an
hour
in
mr
hope
parlour
where
mr
grey
had
deposited
her
till
nine
when
he
was
to
call
for
her
she
made
the
same
affectionate
declaration
to
mr
hope
himself
that
he
was
as
dear
to
her
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
son
and
she
continued
i
shall
speak
to
you
with
the
same
freedom
as
i
should
use
with
sydney
and
may
perhaps
ten
years
hence
pray
do
said
mr
hope
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
are
you
going
to
find
fault
with
me
oh
dear
no
what
fault
should
i
have
to
find
with
you
unless
indeed
it
be
a
fault
or
a
folly
to
leave
your
own
happiness
and
that
of
another
person
in
needless
uncertainty
mr
hope
changed
colour
quite
to
the
extent
of
her
wishes
i
know
continued
she
that
your
illness
has
put
a
stop
to
everything
and
that
it
has
left
you
little
nerve
for
any
explanation
of
the
kind
but
you
are
growing
stronger
every
day
now
and
the
case
is
becoming
so
serious
on
the
other
side
that
i
own
i
dread
the
consequences
of
much
further
delay
you
see
i
speak
openly
she
had
every
encouragement
to
do
so
for
mr
hope
countenance
was
flushed
with
what
appeared
to
her
to
be
delight
you
observed
yourself
you
know
that
hester
did
not
look
well
and
indeed
the
few
weeks
after
your
accident
were
so
trying
to
her
the
exertions
she
made
to
conceal
her
feelings
were
so
but
i
must
spare
her
delicacy
i
trust
you
are
quite
assured
that
she
has
not
the
most
remote
idea
of
my
speaking
to
you
thus
indeed
no
human
being
is
in
the
least
aware
of
it
hester
miss
ibbotson
pray
mrs
grey
do
not
say
another
word
let
us
talk
of
something
else
presently
when
i
have
finished
you
must
have
seen
that
i
love
this
dear
girl
as
a
daughter
and
there
is
not
a
thought
of
her
heart
that
she
can
conceal
from
me
though
her
delicacy
is
so
great
that
i
am
confident
she
thinks
me
unaware
of
her
state
of
mind
at
this
moment
but
i
saw
how
the
affair
was
going
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
failure
of
her
health
and
looks
since
your
accident
have
left
me
no
doubt
whatever
and
have
made
me
feel
it
my
duty
to
give
you
the
encouragement
your
modesty
requires
and
to
confide
to
you
how
wholly
her
happiness
lies
in
your
hands
hester
miss
ibbotson
i
assure
you
mrs
grey
you
must
be
completely
mistaken
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
not
so
easily
mistaken
as
some
people
there
is
mrs
rowland
now
i
am
sure
she
fancies
that
her
brother
is
in
love
with
hester
when
it
is
plain
to
everybody
but
herself
that
he
and
my
other
young
cousin
are
coming
to
a
conclusion
as
fast
as
need
be
however
i
know
you
do
not
like
to
hear
me
find
fault
with
mrs
rowland
and
besides
i
have
no
right
to
tell
margaret
secrets
so
we
will
say
no
more
about
that
mr
hope
sighed
heavily
these
remarks
upon
enderby
and
margaret
accorded
but
too
well
with
his
own
observations
he
could
not
let
mrs
grey
proceed
without
opposition
but
all
he
was
capable
of
was
to
repeat
that
she
was
entirely
mistaken
yes
that
is
what
men
like
you
always
say
in
all
sincerity
of
course
your
modesty
always
stands
in
the
way
of
your
happiness
for
a
while
but
you
are
no
losers
by
it
the
happiness
is
all
the
sweeter
when
it
comes
at
last
but
that
is
not
what
i
mean
you
have
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
explain
myself
i
hardly
know
how
to
say
it
but
it
must
be
said
you
have
mistaken
my
intentions
mistaken
them
altogether
it
was
now
mrs
grey
turn
to
change
colour
she
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
do
you
mean
to
say
mr
hope
that
you
have
not
been
paying
attentions
to
hester
ibbotson
i
do
say
so
that
i
have
paid
no
attentions
of
the
nature
you
suppose
you
compel
me
to
speak
plainly
then
i
must
speak
plainly
too
mr
hope
if
any
one
had
told
me
you
would
play
the
part
you
have
played
i
should
have
resented
the
imputation
as
i
resent
your
conduct
now
if
you
have
not
intended
to
win
hester
affections
you
have
behaved
infamously
you
have
won
her
attachment
by
attentions
which
have
never
varied
from
the
very
first
evening
that
she
entered
our
house
till
this
afternoon
you
have
amused
yourself
with
her
it
seems
and
now
you
are
going
to
break
her
heart
stop
stop
mrs
grey
i
can
not
hear
this
there
is
not
a
soul
in
the
place
that
does
not
think
as
i
do
there
is
not
a
soul
that
will
not
say
let
us
put
aside
what
people
may
say
if
by
any
imprudence
of
my
own
i
have
brought
blame
upon
myself
i
must
bear
it
the
important
point
is
surely
mrs
grey
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
in
error
about
miss
ibbotson
miss
ibbotson
state
of
mind
no
mr
hope
it
is
not
possible
and
being
in
for
it
as
she
said
mrs
grey
gave
such
a
detail
of
her
observations
and
of
unquestionable
facts
as
left
the
truth
indeed
in
little
doubt
and
margaret
said
mr
hope
in
a
troubled
voice
do
you
know
anything
of
her
views
of
my
conduct
margaret
is
not
so
easily
seen
through
as
hester
said
mrs
grey
an
assertion
from
which
mr
hope
silently
dissented
margaret
appearing
to
him
the
most
person
he
had
ever
known
lucid
in
her
sincerity
transparent
in
her
unconsciousness
he
was
aware
that
mrs
grey
had
been
so
occupied
with
hester
as
not
to
have
been
open
to
impression
from
margaret
margaret
is
not
so
easily
seen
through
as
hester
you
know
and
she
and
i
have
never
talked
over
your
conduct
confidentially
but
if
margaret
does
not
perceive
the
alteration
in
her
sister
and
the
cause
of
it
it
can
only
be
because
she
is
occupied
with
her
own
concerns
that
is
not
like
margaret
thought
mr
hope
however
she
does
see
it
i
am
sure
for
she
has
proposed
their
return
to
birmingham
their
immediate
return
though
their
affairs
are
far
from
being
settled
yet
and
they
do
not
know
what
they
will
have
to
live
upon
they
promised
to
stay
till
october
too
and
we
are
only
half
through
august
yet
margaret
can
hardly
have
any
wish
to
leave
us
on
her
own
account
considering
whom
she
must
leave
behind
it
is
for
hester
sake
i
am
confident
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
fact
mr
hope
your
honour
is
involved
i
repeat
you
have
won
this
dear
affections
and
now
you
must
act
as
a
man
of
conscience
which
i
have
always
supposed
you
to
be
mr
hope
was
tempted
to
ask
for
further
confirmation
from
the
opinions
of
the
people
who
were
about
hester
but
he
would
not
investigate
the
degree
of
exposure
which
might
have
taken
place
even
if
no
one
agreed
with
mrs
grey
this
would
be
no
proof
that
her
conviction
was
a
wrong
one
it
might
happen
through
hester
successful
concealment
of
what
she
must
be
striving
to
suppress
mrs
grey
urged
him
about
his
honour
and
conscience
more
closely
than
he
could
bear
he
faintly
begged
her
to
leave
him
he
obtained
from
her
a
promise
that
she
would
inform
no
person
of
what
had
been
said
and
she
again
assured
him
that
neither
hester
nor
any
one
else
had
the
remotest
idea
of
her
speaking
as
she
had
done
this
evening
on
his
part
mr
hope
declared
that
he
should
reflect
on
what
had
passed
and
act
with
the
strictest
regard
to
duty
as
in
mrs
grey
eyes
his
duty
was
perfectly
clear
this
declaration
was
completely
satisfactory
she
saw
the
young
people
with
her
mind
eye
settled
in
the
corner
house
which
belonged
to
mr
rowland
and
was
delighted
that
she
had
spoken
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
mr
hope
would
discover
she
had
little
doubt
that
he
had
loved
hester
all
this
time
without
having
been
conscious
what
the
attraction
had
really
been
and
in
a
little
while
he
would
be
thankful
to
her
for
having
smoothed
his
way
for
him
with
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
she
bade
him
just
as
mr
grey
drove
up
to
the
door
she
whispered
once
more
that
he
was
as
dear
to
her
as
a
son
and
that
this
was
the
reason
of
her
having
spoken
so
plainly
how
are
you
this
evening
hope
said
mr
grey
from
the
doorway
on
the
sofa
eh
do
rise
for
me
then
rather
done
up
eh
ah
i
was
afraid
you
were
for
getting
on
too
fast
bad
economy
in
the
end
you
will
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
us
so
i
shall
not
come
in
take
care
of
yourself
i
beg
of
you
in
what
a
state
of
mind
was
hope
left
his
motherly
friend
little
guessed
what
a
storm
she
had
raised
in
a
spirit
usually
as
calm
as
a
summer
morning
there
was
nothing
to
him
so
abhorrent
as
giving
pain
nothing
so
intolerable
in
idea
as
injuring
any
human
being
and
he
was
now
compelled
to
believe
that
through
some
conduct
of
his
own
some
imprudence
in
a
case
where
imprudence
is
guilt
he
had
broken
up
the
peace
of
a
woman
whom
though
he
did
not
love
he
respected
and
warmly
regarded
his
mind
was
in
too
tumultuous
a
state
for
him
to
attempt
to
settle
with
himself
the
degree
of
his
culpability
he
only
knew
that
he
was
abased
in
his
own
sense
of
deep
injury
towards
a
in
the
same
breath
came
the
destruction
of
his
hopes
hopes
of
which
till
the
moment
he
had
been
scarcely
conscious
with
regard
to
the
one
on
whom
his
thoughts
had
been
really
fixed
he
had
pledged
himself
to
act
strictly
according
to
his
sense
of
duty
his
consolation
his
refuge
in
every
former
trial
of
life
since
the
days
of
childhood
had
been
in
resolving
to
abide
faithfully
by
the
decisions
of
duty
in
this
he
had
found
freedom
in
this
he
had
met
strength
and
repose
so
that
no
evil
had
been
intolerable
to
him
but
what
was
his
duty
now
amidst
the
contradictions
of
honour
and
conscience
in
the
present
case
where
should
he
find
his
accustomed
refuge
at
one
moment
he
saw
clearly
the
obligation
to
devote
himself
to
her
whose
affections
he
had
gained
thoughtlessly
and
carelessly
it
is
true
but
to
other
eyes
purposely
at
the
next
moment
the
sin
of
marrying
without
love
if
not
while
loving
another
rose
vividly
before
him
and
made
him
shrink
from
what
an
instant
before
seemed
clear
duty
the
only
hope
was
in
the
possibility
of
mistake
which
might
yet
remain
the
whole
could
not
be
mistake
about
hester
and
enderby
and
margaret
and
all
mrs
grey
convictions
some
of
all
this
must
be
true
the
probability
was
that
it
was
all
true
and
if
so
he
could
almost
repine
that
he
had
not
died
when
his
death
was
expected
then
he
should
not
have
known
of
all
this
injury
and
woe
then
he
should
not
have
had
to
witness
margaret
love
for
another
then
hester
quiet
grief
would
have
melted
away
with
time
unembittered
by
reproach
of
him
no
one
had
till
this
hour
loved
and
relished
life
more
than
he
yet
now
this
gladsome
being
caught
himself
mourning
that
he
had
survived
his
accident
he
roused
himself
from
this
but
all
was
fearful
and
confused
before
him
he
could
see
nothing
as
it
was
and
as
it
ought
to
be
he
could
decide
upon
nothing
he
must
take
time
he
must
be
deliberate
upon
this
the
most
important
transaction
of
his
life
thus
he
determined
as
the
last
remains
of
twilight
faded
away
in
his
apartment
and
the
night
air
blew
in
chill
from
the
open
window
he
was
so
exhausted
by
his
mental
conflict
as
to
be
scarcely
able
to
rise
to
close
the
window
and
retire
to
rest
there
was
one
hope
familiar
as
the
sunshine
to
his
eyes
but
unusually
feeble
still
abiding
in
his
mind
for
comfort
that
he
should
sooner
or
later
clearly
discern
what
it
was
his
duty
to
do
all
was
at
present
dark
but
this
light
might
flow
in
he
would
wait
he
would
not
act
till
it
did
he
did
wait
for
many
days
he
was
not
seen
in
any
of
the
haunts
to
which
he
had
begun
to
return
the
answer
to
inquiries
was
that
mr
hope
was
not
so
well
and
wished
for
entire
quiet
everyone
was
anxious
hester
was
wretched
and
mrs
grey
extremely
restless
and
uneasy
she
made
several
attempts
to
see
him
but
in
no
instance
did
she
succeed
she
wrote
him
a
private
note
and
received
only
a
friendly
verbal
answer
such
as
all
the
world
might
hear
mr
hope
did
wait
for
his
duty
to
grow
clear
in
the
accumulating
light
of
thought
he
decided
at
length
how
to
act
and
he
decided
wrong
not
for
want
of
waiting
long
enough
but
because
some
considerations
intruded
themselves
which
warped
his
judgment
and
sophisticated
his
feelings
he
decided
upon
making
the
great
mistake
of
his
life
nothing
had
ever
been
clearer
to
his
mind
than
the
guilt
of
marrying
without
love
no
man
could
have
spoken
more
strongly
more
solemnly
than
he
on
the
presumption
the
dishonourableness
the
profligacy
of
such
an
act
but
he
was
unaware
how
a
man
may
be
betrayed
into
it
while
he
has
neither
presumption
nor
treachery
nor
profligacy
in
his
thoughts
hope
went
through
a
world
of
meditation
during
the
days
of
his
close
retirement
some
of
his
thoughts
were
superficial
and
some
deceived
him
he
considered
margaret
lost
to
him
he
glanced
forwards
to
his
desolation
when
he
should
lose
the
society
of
both
sisters
an
event
likely
to
happen
almost
immediately
unless
he
should
so
act
as
to
retain
them
he
dwelt
upon
hester
beauty
her
superiority
of
mind
to
every
woman
but
one
whom
he
had
known
her
attachment
to
himself
her
dependence
upon
him
he
pondered
these
things
till
the
tone
of
his
mind
was
lowered
and
too
many
superficial
feelings
mingled
with
the
sacredness
of
the
transaction
and
impaired
its
integrity
under
their
influence
he
decided
what
to
do
he
had
no
intention
all
this
while
of
taking
mrs
grey
word
for
the
whole
matter
without
test
or
confirmation
from
the
beginning
he
was
aware
that
his
first
step
must
be
to
ascertain
that
she
was
not
mistaken
and
this
was
his
first
step
there
were
two
obvious
methods
of
proceeding
one
was
to
consult
mr
grey
who
stood
in
the
place
of
guardian
to
these
girls
as
to
the
probability
of
his
success
with
hester
in
case
of
his
proposing
himself
to
her
the
other
was
to
ask
the
same
question
of
margaret
the
advantage
of
speaking
to
mr
grey
was
that
he
might
not
be
bound
to
proceed
in
case
of
mr
grey
differing
from
his
lady
view
of
the
case
but
then
mr
grey
was
perhaps
unaware
of
the
real
state
of
mind
from
margaret
there
was
certainty
of
hearing
nothing
but
the
truth
however
little
of
it
her
feelings
for
her
sister
might
allow
her
to
reveal
but
such
a
conversation
with
her
would
compel
him
to
proceed
all
retreat
would
be
cut
off
after
it
and
he
naturally
shrank
from
conversing
with
margaret
of
all
people
on
this
subject
but
hope
was
equal
to
any
effort
which
he
thought
a
matter
of
duty
and
he
resolved
not
to
flinch
from
this
he
would
speak
first
to
mr
grey
and
if
mr
grey
did
not
undertake
to
answer
for
hester
indifference
he
would
seek
an
interview
with
margaret
if
margaret
should
encourage
his
advances
on
her
sister
behalf
the
matter
was
decided
he
should
have
a
wife
who
might
be
the
pride
of
any
man
whom
it
would
be
an
honour
to
any
man
to
have
attached
if
as
was
still
just
possible
margaret
should
believe
that
her
sister
felt
no
peculiar
regard
for
him
he
thought
he
might
intimate
so
much
of
the
truth
as
without
offending
her
feelings
on
her
sister
account
would
secure
for
him
freedom
to
reconsider
his
purposes
no
man
disliked
more
than
he
so
circuitous
a
method
of
acting
in
the
most
important
affair
of
life
he
had
always
believed
that
in
the
case
of
a
genuine
and
virtuous
attachment
there
can
or
ought
to
be
nothing
but
the
most
entire
simplicity
of
conduct
in
the
parties
no
appeal
to
any
but
each
other
no
seeking
of
an
intervention
where
no
stranger
ought
to
intermeddle
with
the
joy
but
the
present
affair
though
perpetually
brightening
before
hope
fancy
could
not
for
a
moment
be
thought
of
as
of
this
kind
and
here
the
circuitous
method
which
had
always
appeared
disgusting
to
his
imagination
was
a
matter
of
necessity
to
his
conscience
chapter
twelve
a
turn
in
the
shrubbery
mr
grey
looked
extremely
pleased
when
asked
whether
he
supposed
hester
might
be
won
his
reply
was
simple
enough
he
was
not
in
his
young
cousin
confidence
he
could
not
undertake
to
answer
for
the
state
of
mind
of
young
ladies
but
he
knew
of
no
other
attachment
of
nothing
which
need
discourage
his
friend
hope
who
would
have
his
hearty
good
wishes
if
he
should
persevere
in
his
project
yes
yes
he
fully
understood
it
was
not
to
be
spoken
of
it
was
to
rest
entirely
between
themselves
till
hope
should
have
felt
his
way
a
little
he
knew
it
was
the
fashion
in
these
days
to
feel
the
way
a
little
more
than
was
thought
necessary
or
desirable
in
his
time
but
he
liked
that
all
should
follow
their
own
method
in
an
affair
which
concerned
themselves
so
much
more
than
any
one
else
so
the
matter
should
be
a
perfect
secret
as
mr
hope
desired
though
he
did
not
fancy
it
would
have
to
be
kept
so
close
for
any
great
length
of
time
this
was
over
now
for
the
interview
with
margaret
which
had
become
necessary
his
reappearance
in
the
family
party
at
mr
grey
under
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
mrs
grey
herself
must
be
an
awkward
business
at
the
best
while
he
remained
in
uncertainty
the
only
way
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
uncertainty
as
soon
as
possible
he
would
go
this
very
afternoon
and
ascertain
his
fate
before
the
day
was
over
he
went
boldly
up
to
the
door
and
rang
the
family
were
all
out
in
the
garden
after
dinner
alice
said
would
mr
hope
join
them
there
or
would
he
rest
himself
while
she
told
them
he
had
arrived
alice
anxiety
about
his
looks
was
not
yet
satisfied
i
will
step
in
here
said
he
the
door
of
the
blue
parlour
being
open
send
morris
to
me
morris
at
that
moment
crossing
the
hall
morris
i
want
to
see
miss
margaret
will
you
just
tell
her
that
some
one
wishes
to
speak
with
her
i
know
she
will
excuse
my
asking
the
favour
of
her
to
come
in
miss
margaret
sir
yes
i
am
sure
sir
you
look
more
fit
to
sit
here
than
to
be
gathering
apples
with
them
all
in
the
orchard
did
you
say
miss
margaret
sir
yes
whatever
else
may
be
in
morris
mind
thought
hope
it
is
clear
that
she
is
surprised
at
my
wanting
to
see
here
she
comes
he
was
not
sorry
that
the
step
paused
in
the
hall
that
there
was
a
delay
of
some
seconds
before
margaret
appeared
he
felt
as
weak
at
the
moment
as
on
first
rising
from
his
bed
after
his
accident
but
he
rallied
his
resolution
before
he
met
her
eye
now
timid
and
shrinking
as
he
had
never
seen
it
before
margaret
was
very
grave
and
as
nearly
awkward
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
she
shook
hands
with
him
however
and
hoped
that
he
was
better
again
i
am
better
thank
you
will
you
sit
down
and
let
me
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
margaret
sank
down
while
he
shut
the
door
i
hear
said
he
that
you
are
already
thinking
of
returning
to
birmingham
is
this
true
yes
we
shall
go
home
in
a
few
days
then
before
you
leave
us
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
your
advice
at
the
word
advice
a
glow
of
pleasure
passed
over
margaret
face
and
she
could
not
quite
suppress
a
sigh
of
relief
she
now
looked
up
freely
and
fearlessly
all
this
was
good
for
mr
hope
but
it
went
to
his
heart
and
for
a
moment
checked
his
speech
he
soon
proceeded
however
i
want
your
advice
as
a
friend
and
also
some
information
which
you
alone
can
give
me
what
i
have
to
say
relates
to
your
sister
margaret
ecstasy
of
hope
was
scarcely
controllable
for
her
sake
she
hung
her
head
upon
her
bosom
the
better
to
conceal
her
joy
it
was
a
bitter
moment
for
him
who
could
not
but
note
and
rightly
interpret
the
change
in
her
countenance
and
manner
i
wish
to
know
if
you
have
no
objection
to
tell
me
whether
your
sister
is
disengaged
i
have
no
objection
to
say
declared
margaret
looking
up
cheerfully
that
my
sister
is
not
engaged
that
is
the
information
i
wished
for
now
for
the
opinion
which
i
venture
to
ask
of
you
as
of
the
one
to
whom
your
sister
mind
is
best
known
do
you
believe
that
if
i
attempt
it
i
am
likely
to
win
her
margaret
was
silent
it
was
difficult
to
answer
the
question
with
perfect
truth
and
with
due
consideration
to
her
sister
i
see
said
hope
that
you
do
not
approve
my
question
nor
do
i
myself
rather
tell
me
whether
you
suppose
that
she
prefers
any
one
to
me
that
she
had
rather
i
should
not
seek
her
whether
in
short
you
would
advise
me
to
withdraw
by
no
means
said
margaret
i
can
not
say
anything
tending
to
deter
you
i
know
of
nothing
which
need
discourage
you
and
i
assure
you
you
have
my
best
wishes
that
you
may
succeed
she
looked
at
him
with
the
bright
expression
of
sincerity
and
regard
which
had
touched
his
heart
oftener
and
more
deeply
than
all
beauty
he
could
not
have
offered
to
shake
hands
at
the
moment
but
she
held
out
hers
and
he
could
not
but
take
it
the
door
burst
open
at
the
same
instant
and
mr
enderby
entered
both
let
drop
the
hand
they
held
and
looked
extremely
awkward
and
grave
a
single
glance
was
enough
to
send
mr
enderby
away
without
having
spoken
his
errand
which
was
to
summon
margaret
to
the
orchard
for
the
final
shake
of
the
when
he
was
gone
each
saw
that
the
face
of
the
other
was
crimson
but
while
hope
had
a
look
of
distress
which
margaret
wondered
at
remembering
how
soon
mr
enderby
would
understand
the
nature
of
the
interview
she
was
struggling
to
restrain
a
laugh
thank
you
for
your
truth
said
mr
hope
i
knew
i
might
depend
upon
it
from
you
i
have
told
you
all
i
can
said
margaret
rising
and
it
will
be
best
to
say
no
more
at
present
it
is
due
to
my
sister
to
close
our
conversation
here
if
she
should
choose
continued
she
gaily
to
give
us
leave
to
renew
it
hereafter
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
on
my
own
part
you
have
done
me
the
honour
of
calling
me
you
have
my
friendship
i
assure
you
and
my
good
wishes
hope
grasped
her
hand
with
a
fervour
which
absolved
him
from
the
use
of
words
he
then
opened
the
door
for
her
i
must
return
to
the
orchard
said
she
will
you
go
or
will
you
repose
yourself
here
till
we
come
in
to
tea
mr
hope
preferred
remaining
where
he
was
the
die
was
cast
and
he
must
think
his
hour
of
meditation
was
salutary
he
had
never
seen
margaret
so
he
dared
not
dwell
upon
it
but
then
never
had
her
simplicity
of
feeling
towards
him
her
ingenuous
friendship
unmixed
with
a
thought
of
love
been
so
clear
he
had
made
no
impression
upon
her
except
through
her
sister
and
for
her
sister
he
recalled
the
stiffness
and
fear
with
which
she
had
come
when
summoned
to
a
her
sudden
relief
on
the
mention
of
her
sister
and
her
joyous
encouragement
of
his
project
i
ought
to
rejoice
i
do
rejoice
at
this
thought
he
it
seems
as
if
everyone
else
would
be
made
happy
by
this
affair
it
must
have
been
my
own
doing
there
must
have
been
that
in
my
manner
and
conduct
which
authorised
all
this
expectation
and
satisfaction
an
expectation
and
satisfaction
which
prove
to
be
no
fancy
of
mrs
grey
i
have
brought
upon
myself
the
charge
of
hester
happiness
she
is
a
noble
woman
bound
to
me
by
all
that
can
engage
my
honour
my
generosity
my
affection
she
shall
be
happy
from
this
day
if
my
most
entire
devotion
can
make
her
so
margaret
loves
enderby
i
am
glad
i
know
it
i
made
him
dreadfully
jealous
just
now
i
must
relieve
him
as
soon
as
possible
i
do
not
know
how
far
matters
may
have
gone
between
them
but
margaret
is
not
at
liberty
to
explain
what
he
saw
till
i
have
spoken
to
hester
there
must
be
no
delay
i
will
do
it
this
evening
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
communicate
with
mrs
grey
if
mr
grey
is
at
home
he
will
make
the
opportunity
for
me
mr
grey
was
at
home
and
on
the
alert
to
take
a
hint
i
guessed
how
it
was
said
he
margaret
has
been
trying
to
keep
down
her
spirits
but
not
a
child
among
them
all
flew
about
the
orchard
as
she
did
when
mr
enderby
had
been
to
look
for
her
and
she
followed
him
back
i
thought
at
first
it
was
something
on
her
own
account
but
enderby
looked
too
dull
and
sulky
for
that
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
jealous
of
you
he
found
you
together
did
he
well
he
will
soon
know
why
i
trust
oh
you
have
a
hearty
in
margaret
i
am
sure
now
you
see
they
are
setting
sophia
down
to
the
piano
and
i
think
i
can
find
for
you
the
opportunity
you
want
if
you
really
wish
to
bring
the
business
to
a
conclusion
this
evening
i
will
call
hester
out
to
take
a
turn
with
me
in
the
shrubbery
as
she
and
i
often
do
these
fine
evenings
and
then
if
you
choose
you
can
meet
us
there
hester
was
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
invited
by
mr
grey
to
the
turn
in
the
shrubbery
which
was
one
of
the
best
of
her
quiet
pleasures
a
solace
which
she
enjoyed
the
more
the
more
she
became
attached
to
kind
mr
grey
and
she
did
much
respect
and
love
him
this
evening
she
was
glad
of
any
summons
from
the
room
margaret
had
fully
intended
not
to
speak
to
her
of
what
had
passed
thinking
it
best
for
her
sister
dignity
and
for
mr
hope
satisfaction
that
he
should
not
be
anticipated
all
this
was
very
wise
and
undeniable
while
she
was
walking
back
to
the
orchard
but
it
so
happened
that
hester
hand
hung
by
her
side
as
she
stood
looking
up
at
the
unaware
that
margaret
had
left
the
party
margaret
could
not
resist
seizing
the
hand
and
pressing
it
with
so
much
silent
emotion
such
a
glance
of
joy
as
threw
hester
into
a
state
of
wonder
and
expectation
not
a
syllable
could
she
extort
from
margaret
either
on
the
spot
or
afterwards
when
summoned
to
tea
whether
it
was
on
account
of
mr
hope
return
to
the
house
she
could
not
satisfy
herself
she
had
sat
conscious
and
inwardly
distressed
at
the
where
nothing
remarkable
had
occurred
and
was
glad
to
escape
from
the
circle
where
all
that
was
said
appeared
to
her
excited
spirit
to
be
tiresome
or
trifling
or
vexatious
how
different
was
it
all
when
she
returned
to
the
house
how
she
loved
the
whole
world
and
no
one
in
it
was
dull
and
nothing
was
trifling
and
it
was
out
of
the
power
of
circumstances
to
vex
her
life
had
become
heaven
its
doubts
its
cares
its
troubles
were
gone
and
all
had
given
place
to
a
joy
she
should
grow
perfect
now
for
she
had
one
whom
she
believed
perfect
to
lead
her
on
her
pride
her
jealousy
would
trouble
her
no
more
it
was
for
want
of
sympathy
perfect
sympathy
always
at
hand
that
she
had
been
a
prey
to
them
she
should
pine
no
more
for
there
was
one
who
was
her
own
a
calm
nameless
bliss
had
wrapped
itself
round
her
spirit
and
brought
her
as
near
to
her
maker
as
if
she
had
been
his
favoured
child
there
needs
no
other
proof
that
happiness
is
the
most
wholesome
moral
atmosphere
and
that
in
which
the
immortality
of
man
is
destined
ultimately
to
thrive
than
the
elevation
of
soul
the
religious
aspiration
which
attends
the
first
assurance
the
first
sober
certainty
of
true
love
there
is
much
of
this
religious
aspiration
amidst
all
warmth
of
virtuous
affections
there
is
a
vivid
love
of
god
in
the
child
that
lays
its
cheek
against
the
cheek
of
its
mother
and
clasps
its
arms
about
her
neck
god
is
thanked
perhaps
unconsciously
for
the
brightness
of
his
earth
on
summer
evenings
when
a
brother
and
sister
who
have
long
been
parted
pour
out
their
heart
stores
to
each
other
and
feel
their
course
of
thought
brightening
as
it
runs
when
the
aged
parent
hears
of
the
honours
his
children
have
won
or
looks
round
upon
their
innocent
faces
as
the
glory
of
his
decline
his
mind
reverts
to
him
who
in
them
prescribed
the
purpose
of
his
life
and
bestowed
its
grace
but
religious
as
is
the
mood
of
every
good
affection
none
is
so
devotional
as
that
of
love
especially
so
called
the
soul
is
then
the
very
temple
of
adoration
of
faith
of
holy
purity
of
heroism
of
charity
at
such
a
moment
the
human
creature
shoots
up
into
the
angel
there
is
nothing
on
earth
too
defiled
for
its
charity
nothing
in
hell
too
appalling
for
its
heroism
nothing
in
heaven
too
glorious
for
its
sympathy
strengthened
sustained
vivified
by
that
most
mysterious
power
union
with
another
spirit
it
feels
itself
set
well
forth
on
the
way
of
victory
over
evil
sent
out
conquering
and
to
conquer
there
is
no
other
such
crisis
in
human
life
the
philosopher
may
experience
uncontrollable
agitation
in
verifying
his
principle
of
balancing
systems
of
worlds
feeling
perhaps
as
if
he
actually
saw
the
creative
hand
in
the
act
of
sending
the
planets
forth
on
their
everlasting
way
but
this
philosopher
solitary
seraph
as
he
may
be
regarded
amidst
a
myriad
of
men
knows
at
such
a
moment
no
emotions
so
divine
as
those
of
the
spirit
becoming
conscious
that
it
is
beloved
be
it
the
peasant
girl
in
the
meadow
or
the
daughter
of
the
sage
reposing
in
her
father
confidence
or
the
artisan
beside
his
loom
or
the
man
of
letters
musing
by
his
fireside
the
warrior
about
to
strike
the
decisive
blow
for
the
liberties
of
a
nation
however
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
the
hour
is
not
in
a
state
of
such
lofty
resolution
as
those
who
by
joining
hearts
are
laying
their
joint
hands
on
the
whole
wide
realm
of
futurity
for
their
own
the
statesman
who
in
the
moment
of
success
feels
that
an
entire
class
of
social
sins
and
woes
is
annihilated
by
his
hand
is
not
conscious
of
so
holy
and
so
intimate
a
thankfulness
as
they
who
are
aware
that
their
redemption
is
come
in
the
presence
of
a
new
and
sovereign
affection
and
these
are
many
they
are
in
all
corners
of
every
land
the
statesman
is
the
leader
of
a
nation
the
warrior
is
the
grace
of
an
age
the
philosopher
is
the
birth
of
a
thousand
years
but
the
lover
where
is
he
not
wherever
parents
look
round
upon
their
children
there
he
has
been
wherever
children
are
at
play
together
there
he
will
soon
be
wherever
there
are
roofs
under
which
men
dwell
wherever
there
is
an
atmosphere
vibrating
with
human
voices
there
is
the
lover
and
there
is
his
lofty
worship
going
on
unspeakable
but
revealed
in
the
brightness
of
the
eye
the
majesty
of
the
presence
and
the
high
temper
of
the
discourse
men
have
been
ungrateful
and
perverse
they
have
done
what
they
could
to
counteract
to
debase
this
most
heavenly
influence
of
their
life
but
the
laws
of
their
maker
are
too
strong
the
benignity
of
their
father
is
too
patient
and
fervent
for
their
opposition
to
withstand
and
true
love
continues
and
will
continue
to
send
up
its
homage
amidst
the
meditations
of
every
eventide
and
the
busy
hum
of
noon
and
the
song
of
the
morning
stars
hester
when
she
the
house
was
full
of
the
commonest
feeling
of
all
in
happy
lovers
a
wonder
that
such
intense
happiness
should
be
permitted
to
her
margaret
was
lingering
about
the
in
the
dusk
and
met
her
sister
at
the
door
of
their
own
apartment
may
i
come
in
said
she
may
you
come
in
oh
margaret
i
want
you
all
is
right
all
is
well
is
it
hester
and
i
was
quite
wrong
throughout
i
grieve
now
that
i
helped
to
make
you
miserable
but
indeed
i
was
miserable
myself
i
saw
no
hope
i
was
completely
mistaken
we
were
both
mistaken
said
hester
resting
her
head
at
shoulder
mistaken
in
judgment
blinded
by
anxiety
but
all
that
is
over
now
margaret
what
have
i
done
that
i
should
be
so
happy
you
have
loved
one
who
deserves
such
a
love
as
yours
said
margaret
smiling
that
is
what
you
have
done
and
you
will
have
the
blessings
of
all
who
know
you
both
you
have
mine
dearest
what
an
ungrateful
wretch
shall
i
be
if
i
do
not
make
every
one
happy
that
is
within
my
reach
cried
hester
margaret
i
will
never
grieve
his
heart
as
i
have
grieved
yours
i
will
never
grieve
yours
again
but
how
is
it
asked
margaret
you
have
not
told
me
yet
is
it
all
settled
a
silent
embrace
told
that
it
was
i
may
shake
hands
with
you
upon
it
then
oh
hester
after
all
our
longings
for
a
brother
you
are
going
to
give
me
one
we
are
not
alone
in
the
world
my
father
our
mother
where
are
they
do
they
know
have
they
foreseen
while
we
have
been
suffering
so
do
they
now
foresee
for
us
there
was
not
one
word
of
his
said
hester
that
i
should
not
have
gloried
in
their
hearing
so
gentle
margaret
so
noble
so
calm
and
you
said
margaret
softly
did
you
speak
speak
openly
yes
it
was
no
time
for
pride
with
him
i
have
no
pride
i
could
not
have
believed
how
i
should
tell
him
all
but
he
was
so
noble
spoke
so
gloriously
that
it
would
have
been
an
insult
to
use
any
disguise
he
knows
all
that
you
know
margaret
and
i
am
not
ashamed
i
honour
you
said
margaret
thank
god
all
is
right
but
where
is
mr
hope
all
this
time
he
went
away
when
i
came
in
you
will
see
him
in
the
morning
can
you
go
down
this
evening
if
you
think
you
can
go
down
yes
this
moment
i
feel
as
if
i
could
face
the
whole
world
let
me
ask
one
thing
may
i
tell
maria
in
the
morning
she
will
be
so
pleased
and
no
one
but
you
understands
my
feelings
so
well
everybody
will
rejoice
with
me
but
i
can
say
anything
to
her
may
i
tell
her
all
in
the
morning
dear
maria
oh
yes
tell
her
from
me
with
my
love
i
know
i
shall
have
her
blessing
now
let
us
go
down
but
we
must
just
settle
how
matters
are
to
proceed
said
margaret
are
the
family
to
know
or
not
oh
let
all
that
take
its
chance
said
hester
i
am
sure
i
do
not
care
let
it
be
as
it
happens
for
at
least
for
at
least
agreed
margaret
all
was
going
on
as
usual
the
working
of
collars
and
of
rugs
was
proceeding
as
the
family
sat
round
the
lamp
on
the
appearance
of
hester
and
margaret
the
book
with
the
society
cover
on
it
was
produced
and
it
was
requested
that
some
one
would
read
aloud
as
it
was
necessary
that
forty
pages
a
day
should
be
gone
through
to
get
the
volume
done
by
the
time
it
must
be
sent
to
mrs
enderby
sophia
asked
whether
some
one
else
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
this
evening
as
she
thought
she
could
finish
her
collar
by
keeping
steadily
to
it
till
bedtime
margaret
took
the
book
and
was
surprised
to
find
how
easy
a
process
it
is
to
read
aloud
passably
without
taking
in
a
word
of
the
sense
fortunately
the
greys
were
not
much
given
to
make
remarks
on
what
they
read
to
have
gone
through
the
books
that
came
from
the
society
was
enough
and
they
could
not
have
accomplished
the
forty
pages
an
evening
if
they
had
stopped
to
talk
the
only
words
spoken
during
the
lecture
therefore
were
occasional
remarks
that
the
reader
seemed
hoarse
and
that
some
one
else
had
better
take
the
book
and
whispered
requests
across
the
table
for
scissors
thread
or
the
adjustment
of
the
light
such
being
the
method
of
literary
exercise
in
the
family
hester
and
margaret
were
able
to
think
of
anything
they
pleased
with
impunity
there
here
comes
papa
said
sophia
and
i
do
not
believe
we
have
read
nearly
forty
pages
where
did
you
begin
margaret
margaret
resigned
the
volume
to
her
to
have
the
place
found
and
was
told
that
she
should
not
have
shifted
the
marker
till
the
evening
reading
was
done
unless
she
at
once
set
it
forward
forty
pages
it
made
it
so
difficult
to
find
the
place
sophia
was
detained
only
five
minutes
from
her
collar
however
before
she
discovered
that
they
had
read
only
pages
mrs
grey
observed
that
mr
grey
was
coming
in
rather
earlier
than
usual
and
sophia
added
that
her
cousins
had
been
a
good
while
in
their
own
room
hester
was
conscious
that
mr
grey
cast
a
rapid
penetrating
glance
upon
her
as
he
drew
his
chair
and
took
his
seat
at
her
elbow
what
a
clever
book
this
is
said
mrs
grey
very
entertaining
added
sophia
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
asked
mr
grey
of
hester
she
smiled
and
said
she
must
read
more
of
it
before
she
could
judge
it
is
such
a
relief
said
mrs
grey
to
have
a
book
like
this
in
hand
after
the
tiresome
things
mr
rowland
orders
in
he
consults
mrs
rowland
notions
about
books
far
too
much
and
she
always
takes
a
fancy
to
the
dullest
one
would
almost
think
it
was
on
purpose
sydney
liked
the
sport
of
knocking
on
the
head
charges
against
the
rowlands
he
showed
by
a
reference
to
the
society
list
that
the
book
just
laid
down
was
ordered
by
the
rowlands
dear
me
sophia
said
her
mother
you
made
quite
a
mistake
you
told
us
it
was
ordered
in
by
mr
hope
i
am
sure
i
thought
so
all
this
time
well
i
dare
say
we
shall
not
be
able
to
finish
it
said
sophia
we
have
read
only
pages
this
evening
papa
how
shockingly
mr
hope
looks
still
does
not
he
i
think
he
looks
worse
than
when
he
was
here
last
and
i
trust
he
will
look
better
when
we
see
him
next
i
have
the
strongest
hopes
that
he
will
now
gain
ground
every
day
i
am
sure
he
seems
to
have
gained
very
little
yet
oh
yes
he
has
as
i
trust
you
will
soon
see
sophia
was
about
to
bewail
mr
hope
sickly
looks
again
when
her
mother
trod
on
her
foot
under
the
table
and
moreover
winked
and
frowned
in
a
very
awful
way
so
that
sophia
felt
silenced
she
could
not
conceive
for
what
reason
not
being
able
to
think
of
anything
else
to
say
to
cover
her
confusion
she
discovered
that
it
was
bedtime
at
least
for
people
who
had
been
gathering
apples
once
more
mrs
grey
gazed
over
her
spectacles
at
her
husband
when
the
young
people
were
gone
my
dear
said
she
what
makes
you
think
that
mr
hope
is
gaining
ground
every
day
my
dear
what
made
you
tread
on
all
our
toes
when
i
said
so
dear
me
i
only
gave
sophia
a
hint
to
prevent
her
saying
dismal
things
before
people
one
does
not
know
what
may
be
passing
in
their
minds
you
know
and
so
you
kindly
show
what
is
passing
in
yours
however
these
young
ladies
may
soon
be
able
perhaps
to
tell
us
more
about
hope
than
we
can
tell
them
my
dear
what
do
you
mean
i
saw
a
glance
between
them
a
smile
when
you
were
silencing
sophia
i
believe
you
may
prepare
yourself
for
some
news
my
dear
i
have
no
doubt
of
hester
state
of
mind
and
i
feel
confident
of
hope
so
here
is
the
case
pretty
well
made
out
between
us
mrs
grey
was
in
raptures
for
a
moment
but
she
then
resumed
her
system
of
mysterious
tokens
she
shook
her
head
and
owned
that
she
had
reason
to
think
her
husband
was
mistaken
well
just
observe
them
the
next
time
they
are
together
that
is
all
and
my
poor
hester
looks
wretchedly
mr
grey
it
really
makes
my
heart
ache
to
see
her
how
differently
people
view
things
i
was
just
thinking
that
i
never
saw
her
so
lovely
with
such
a
sprightliness
such
a
glow
in
her
face
as
five
minutes
ago
just
this
evening
she
does
not
look
so
pale
but
she
is
sadly
altered
grievously
changed
indeed
seeing
this
is
the
only
thing
which
reconciles
me
to
parting
with
her
now
mr
grey
i
should
like
to
know
what
sets
you
smiling
in
that
manner
at
the
poor
girl
i
was
smiling
to
think
how
as
young
ladies
have
been
known
to
change
their
minds
it
may
be
possible
that
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
hester
pick
up
her
good
looks
again
here
in
spite
of
all
that
morris
says
about
her
native
air
i
should
not
wonder
that
we
may
persuade
her
to
stay
yet
mrs
grey
shook
her
head
decisively
she
should
have
been
very
glad
a
little
while
since
to
hear
her
husband
opinion
that
mr
hope
views
were
fixed
upon
hester
but
now
but
men
were
always
so
positive
and
always
the
most
positive
where
they
knew
the
least
a
deep
sigh
from
the
one
party
and
a
broad
smile
from
the
other
closed
the
conversation
chapter
thirteen
sophia
in
the
village
deerbrook
was
not
a
place
where
practical
affairs
could
be
long
kept
secret
even
where
the
best
reasons
for
secrecy
existed
about
engagement
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
concealment
and
it
was
accordingly
made
known
to
every
one
in
deerbrook
in
the
course
of
the
next
margaret
shut
herself
up
with
maria
before
breakfast
and
enjoyed
an
hour
of
hearty
sympathy
from
her
in
the
first
place
as
they
were
both
aware
that
this
communication
was
a
little
out
of
order
mr
and
mrs
grey
having
a
clear
title
to
the
earliest
information
maria
had
to
be
discreet
for
nearly
three
hours
till
she
heard
the
news
from
another
quarter
immediately
after
breakfast
mr
hope
called
on
mr
grey
at
the
office
and
informed
him
mr
grey
stepped
home
and
found
margaret
enlightening
his
wife
sophia
was
next
called
in
while
morris
was
closeted
with
her
young
ladies
sophia
burst
breathless
into
the
to
tell
miss
young
which
she
did
in
whispers
so
loud
as
to
be
overheard
by
the
children
matilda
immediately
found
she
had
left
her
behind
her
and
ran
into
the
house
to
give
her
mamma
the
news
just
at
the
moment
that
mr
grey
was
relating
it
to
his
partner
in
the
office
on
returning
sophia
found
her
mother
putting
on
her
bonnet
having
remembered
that
it
was
quite
time
she
should
be
stepping
across
the
way
to
hear
how
poor
mrs
enderby
was
after
the
of
three
days
ago
this
reminded
sophia
that
she
ought
to
be
inquiring
about
the
worsteds
which
mrs
howell
must
have
got
down
from
london
by
this
time
to
finish
mrs
grey
rug
mrs
grey
could
not
trust
her
eyes
to
match
shades
of
worsteds
and
sophia
now
set
out
with
great
alacrity
to
oblige
her
mother
by
doing
it
for
her
on
the
way
she
met
dr
levitt
about
to
enter
the
house
of
a
sick
parishioner
dr
levitt
hoped
all
at
home
were
well
all
very
well
indeed
sophia
was
obliged
to
him
her
only
fear
was
that
the
excitement
of
present
circumstances
might
be
too
much
for
mamma
mamma
was
so
very
much
attached
to
cousin
hester
and
it
would
be
such
a
delightful
thing
to
have
her
settled
beside
them
perhaps
dr
levitt
had
not
heard
that
hester
and
mr
hope
were
going
to
be
married
no
indeed
he
had
not
he
wondered
his
friend
hope
had
not
told
him
of
his
good
fortune
of
which
he
heartily
wished
him
joy
how
long
had
this
happy
affair
been
settled
not
long
he
fancied
not
very
long
and
perhaps
mr
hope
did
not
consider
that
it
was
quite
made
public
yet
but
sophia
thought
that
dr
levitt
ought
to
know
dr
levitt
thanked
her
and
said
he
would
try
and
find
hope
in
the
course
of
the
morning
to
congratulate
him
and
he
and
mrs
levitt
would
give
themselves
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
the
ladies
very
shortly
ritson
how
is
your
wife
said
sophia
crossing
over
to
speak
to
a
labourer
who
was
on
his
way
up
the
street
a
deal
better
miss
she
coming
about
right
nicely
ah
that
is
mr
hope
doing
he
attends
her
of
course
oh
yes
miss
he
done
her
a
sight
o
good
ah
so
he
always
does
but
ritson
if
he
should
not
be
able
to
attend
to
her
quite
so
closely
as
usual
just
now
you
will
excuse
it
when
you
hear
how
it
is
lord
miss
the
wonder
is
that
he
has
come
at
all
so
ill
as
he
has
been
hisself
i
do
mean
that
you
will
soon
see
him
very
well
now
he
is
going
to
be
married
ritson
what
is
he
well
to
my
cousin
miss
ibbotson
he
will
be
more
at
our
house
you
know
than
anywhere
else
and
with
a
wink
which
was
a
very
good
miniature
of
her
mother
sophia
passed
on
leaving
ritson
to
bless
mr
hope
and
the
pretty
young
lady
she
cast
a
glance
into
the
butcher
shop
as
she
arrived
opposite
to
it
and
her
heart
leaped
up
when
she
saw
mrs
james
the
lawyer
wife
watching
the
weighing
of
a
loin
of
veal
you
will
excuse
my
interrupting
you
mrs
james
said
she
from
the
threshold
of
the
shop
but
we
are
anxious
to
know
whether
mr
james
thinks
mrs
enderby
really
altered
of
late
we
saw
him
go
in
last
week
and
we
heard
it
was
to
make
an
alteration
in
her
will
i
often
wonder
how
things
get
abroad
said
mrs
james
my
husband
makes
such
a
particular
point
of
never
speaking
of
such
affairs
and
i
am
sure
no
one
ever
hears
them
from
me
i
believe
mrs
enderby
told
mamma
that
about
the
will
herself
well
that
is
as
she
pleases
of
course
said
mrs
james
smiling
what
is
the
weight
with
the
kidney
mr
jones
we
should
like
so
to
know
resumed
sophia
whether
mr
james
considers
mrs
enderby
much
altered
of
late
i
should
think
you
would
be
better
able
to
judge
than
he
miss
grey
i
believe
you
see
her
ten
times
to
his
once
that
is
the
very
reason
we
see
her
so
often
that
a
gradual
change
would
be
less
likely
to
strike
us
mr
hope
will
give
you
satisfaction
he
must
be
a
better
judge
than
any
of
us
oh
yes
but
we
can
not
expect
him
to
have
eyes
for
any
person
but
one
at
present
you
know
oh
so
he
is
going
to
marry
deborah
giles
after
all
deborah
giles
yes
was
he
not
said
to
be
engaged
to
her
some
time
ago
deborah
giles
the
boatman
daughter
i
declare
i
never
heard
of
such
a
place
as
this
for
gossip
why
deborah
giles
can
barely
read
and
write
and
she
is
beneath
mr
hope
in
every
way
i
do
not
believe
he
ever
spoke
to
her
in
his
life
oh
well
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
i
heard
something
about
it
eleven
and
threepence
can
you
change
a
sovereign
mr
jones
and
pray
send
home
the
chops
immediately
it
is
my
cousin
miss
ibbotson
that
mr
hope
is
engaged
to
said
sophia
unable
to
refrain
from
disclosures
which
she
yet
saw
were
not
cared
for
the
beautiful
miss
ibbotson
you
know
indeed
i
am
sure
somebody
said
it
was
deborah
giles
then
you
think
mr
jones
we
may
depend
upon
you
for
game
when
the
season
begins
mr
jones
seemed
more
interested
in
the
news
than
his
customer
he
wished
mr
hope
all
good
luck
with
his
pretty
lady
sophia
thought
herself
fortunate
when
she
saw
mr
enderby
turn
out
of
the
with
his
youngest
nephew
a
boy
still
in
petticoats
perched
upon
his
shoulder
mr
enderby
bowed
but
did
not
seem
to
heed
her
call
he
jumped
through
the
turnstile
and
proceeded
to
canter
along
the
church
lane
amidst
the
glee
of
the
child
so
rapidly
that
sophia
was
obliged
to
give
up
the
hope
of
being
the
first
to
tell
him
the
news
it
was
very
provoking
she
should
have
liked
to
see
how
he
would
look
she
was
sure
of
a
delighted
listener
in
mrs
howell
to
whom
no
communication
ever
came
amiss
but
there
was
a
condition
to
mrs
howell
listening
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
tell
her
own
news
first
when
she
found
that
sophia
wanted
to
match
some
worsteds
she
and
her
exchanged
sympathetic
glances
mrs
howell
sighing
with
her
head
on
the
right
side
and
miss
miskin
groaning
with
her
head
on
the
left
side
are
you
ill
mrs
howell
asked
sophia
it
shook
me
a
little
i
confess
hearing
that
you
wanted
worsteds
we
have
no
relief
from
ladies
wanting
worsteds
no
relief
day
or
night
added
miss
miskin
day
or
night
surely
you
do
not
sell
worsteds
in
the
said
sophia
not
sell
them
only
match
them
the
matching
them
is
the
trial
i
assure
you
if
you
could
only
hear
my
agent
the
things
he
has
to
tell
about
people
in
my
situation
how
they
are
going
mad
all
over
the
country
with
incessantly
matching
of
worsteds
now
that
that
kind
of
work
is
all
the
fashion
and
nothing
more
likely
for
there
is
no
getting
one
natural
rest
i
am
for
ever
matching
of
worsteds
in
my
dreams
and
when
i
wake
i
seem
to
have
had
no
rest
and
as
you
see
directly
after
breakfast
ladies
come
for
worsteds
and
miss
anderson
messenger
left
a
whole
bundle
of
skeins
to
be
matched
for
her
young
ladies
as
early
as
eight
this
morning
declared
miss
miskin
and
so
we
go
on
it
will
not
be
for
long
i
dare
say
mrs
howell
it
is
a
fashionable
kind
of
work
that
we
may
soon
grow
tired
of
dear
me
think
how
long
former
generations
went
on
with
it
think
of
our
grandmothers
work
and
how
we
are
treading
in
their
steps
we
have
the
beautifulest
patterns
now
i
assure
you
miss
miskin
will
confirm
that
we
sold
one
last
week
the
very
day
we
had
it
the
interior
of
abbotsford
with
sir
walter
and
the
furniture
and
the
dogs
just
like
life
i
assure
you
that
was
beautiful
said
miss
miskin
but
not
to
compare
oh
dear
no
not
to
compare
miss
grey
with
one
that
we
were
just
allowed
the
sight
of
not
a
mere
pattern
but
a
finished
specimen
and
i
never
saw
anything
so
i
declare
i
was
quite
affected
and
so
was
miss
miskin
it
was
the
rivers
of
babylon
most
sweetly
done
there
were
the
harps
all
in
and
the
willows
all
in
i
never
saw
anything
so
touching
i
do
think
mamma
will
trouble
you
for
many
more
worsteds
for
some
time
to
come
mrs
howell
when
there
is
going
to
be
a
wedding
in
the
family
there
is
not
much
time
for
you
know
dear
me
a
wedding
smiled
mrs
howell
a
wedding
only
think
simpered
miss
miskin
yes
mr
hope
and
my
cousin
hester
are
going
to
be
married
i
am
sure
they
will
have
your
best
wishes
mrs
howell
that
they
will
as
i
shall
make
a
point
of
telling
mr
hope
but
miss
grey
i
should
think
it
probable
that
your
mamma
may
think
of
working
a
screen
or
perhaps
a
set
of
rugs
for
the
young
folks
and
i
assure
you
she
will
see
no
such
patterns
anywhere
as
my
agent
sends
down
to
me
as
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
tell
her
and
pray
where
are
mr
hope
and
his
lady
to
live
i
hope
they
have
pleased
their
fancy
with
a
house
that
point
is
not
settled
yet
it
is
a
thing
which
requires
some
consideration
you
know
oh
dear
to
be
sure
it
does
but
i
did
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
in
asking
i
am
sure
only
you
mentioned
making
miss
grey
i
did
not
mean
that
we
have
exactly
set
about
all
that
yet
i
was
only
looking
forward
to
it
and
very
right
too
my
poor
dear
howell
used
to
say
so
to
me
every
time
he
found
so
much
difficulty
in
inducing
me
to
listen
to
future
projects
about
the
happy
day
you
know
he
was
always
for
looking
forward
upon
principle
dear
soul
as
you
say
that
is
the
very
brown
no
doubt
of
it
only
two
skeins
here
ended
sophia
pleasures
in
this
kind
she
could
not
summon
courage
to
face
mrs
plumstead
without
knowing
what
was
the
mood
of
the
day
and
the
of
the
little
stationery
shop
was
closed
and
no
face
was
visible
within
all
her
father
household
and
all
whom
she
had
told
were
as
busy
as
herself
so
that
by
the
time
she
walked
down
the
street
again
nobody
remained
to
be
informed
she
could
only
go
home
put
off
her
bonnet
and
sit
with
her
mother
watching
who
would
call
and
planning
the
external
arrangements
which
constitute
the
whole
interest
of
a
wedding
to
narrow
minds
and
apathetic
hearts
no
one
in
deerbrook
enjoyed
the
news
more
than
mr
enderby
when
he
evaded
sophia
in
the
street
he
little
knew
what
pleasure
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
afford
him
it
was
only
deferred
for
a
few
minutes
however
for
on
his
returning
his
little
nephew
to
mamma
side
he
found
his
mother
and
sister
talking
the
matter
over
mrs
grey
visit
to
mrs
enderby
had
been
unusually
short
as
she
could
not
on
so
busy
a
day
spare
much
time
to
one
person
the
moment
she
was
gone
the
old
lady
rang
for
her
calash
and
shawl
and
prepared
to
cross
the
way
telling
the
news
meanwhile
to
her
maid
phoebe
it
was
a
disappointment
to
find
mrs
rowland
already
informed
but
then
came
philip
ignorant
and
unconscious
as
could
be
desired
the
extreme
graciousness
of
his
sister
guided
him
in
his
guess
when
he
was
desired
to
say
who
was
going
to
be
married
but
there
was
a
trembling
heart
beneath
his
light
speech
it
was
more
difficult
to
disguise
his
joy
when
he
heard
the
truth
he
carried
it
off
by
romping
with
the
child
who
owed
several
rides
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
to
the
fact
that
mr
hope
was
going
to
be
married
to
hester
i
am
delighted
to
see
philip
take
it
in
this
way
observed
mrs
rowland
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
thing
cried
mrs
enderby
but
i
believe
i
should
not
have
said
so
if
you
had
not
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
a
sad
disappointment
to
poor
philip
and
this
prevented
my
saying
quite
so
much
as
i
should
have
done
to
mrs
grey
now
i
find
it
is
all
right
i
shall
just
call
in
and
express
myself
more
warmly
on
my
way
home
i
beg
philip
pardon
i
am
sure
said
mrs
rowland
for
supposing
for
a
moment
that
he
would
think
of
marrying
into
the
grey
connexion
i
did
him
great
injustice
i
own
by
no
means
said
philip
because
i
did
not
happen
to
wish
to
marry
miss
ibbotson
it
does
not
follow
that
i
should
have
been
wrong
if
i
had
it
was
feeling
this
and
a
sense
of
justice
to
her
and
myself
which
made
me
refuse
to
answer
your
questions
some
weeks
ago
or
to
make
any
promises
well
well
let
us
keep
clear
of
mrs
grey
connexions
and
then
you
may
talk
of
them
as
you
please
said
the
sister
in
the
complaisance
of
the
hour
philip
remembered
his
pledge
to
himself
to
uphold
mrs
grey
as
long
as
he
lived
if
she
should
prove
right
about
mr
hope
and
hester
he
began
immediately
to
discharge
his
obligations
to
her
avowing
that
he
did
not
see
why
her
connexion
was
not
as
good
as
his
own
that
mrs
grey
had
many
excellent
points
that
she
was
a
woman
of
a
good
deal
of
sagacity
that
she
had
shown
herself
capable
of
strong
family
attachments
that
she
had
been
gracious
and
kind
to
himself
of
late
in
a
degree
which
he
felt
he
had
not
deserved
and
that
he
considered
that
all
his
family
were
obliged
to
her
for
her
neighbourly
attentions
to
his
mother
mrs
enderby
seized
the
occasion
of
her
son
support
to
say
some
kind
thing
of
the
greys
it
gave
her
frequent
pain
to
hear
them
spoken
of
after
mrs
rowland
usual
fashion
but
when
she
was
alone
with
her
daughter
she
dared
not
object
under
cover
of
mr
rowland
presence
occasionally
and
of
philip
she
ventured
to
say
that
she
thought
the
greys
a
very
fine
family
and
kind
neighbours
to
her
and
much
looked
up
to
in
deerbrook
added
philip
and
a
great
blessing
to
their
poor
neighbours
said
his
mother
dr
levitt
respects
them
for
their
conscientious
dissent
observed
philip
and
mr
hope
who
knows
them
best
says
they
are
a
very
united
family
among
themselves
declared
mrs
enderby
mrs
rowland
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
each
spoke
and
asked
whether
they
were
both
out
of
their
senses
by
no
means
said
philip
i
never
was
more
in
earnest
in
my
life
i
have
always
thought
just
what
i
now
say
protested
mrs
enderby
yes
my
dear
said
the
daughter
scornfully
we
are
all
aware
of
your
ways
of
thinking
on
some
points
of
your
of
my
mother
love
of
justice
and
neighbourly
temper
said
philip
giving
his
little
nephew
a
glorious
somerset
from
his
shoulder
i
believe
if
we
could
find
my
mother
match
the
two
would
be
an
excellent
pair
to
put
into
eddystone
lighthouse
they
would
chat
away
for
a
twelvemonth
together
without
ever
quarrelling
philip
do
let
that
poor
boy
alone
said
mamma
you
are
shaking
him
to
pieces
we
have
both
had
enough
for
the
present
eh
ned
mother
i
am
at
your
service
if
you
are
going
to
call
at
the
greys
mrs
enderby
rose
with
great
alacrity
come
to
me
my
pet
cried
mamma
poor
ned
shall
rest
his
head
in
mamma
lap
there
there
my
pet
mamma
pet
was
not
the
most
agreeable
companion
to
her
when
they
were
left
alone
he
was
crying
lustily
after
uncle
philip
for
all
mamma
could
say
about
uncle
philip
always
tiring
him
to
death
chapter
fourteen
preparing
for
home
the
affair
proceeded
rapidly
as
such
affairs
should
do
where
there
is
no
reason
for
delay
there
was
no
more
talk
of
birmingham
the
journey
which
was
to
have
been
taken
in
a
few
days
was
not
spoken
of
again
the
external
arrangements
advanced
well
so
many
as
there
were
anxious
about
this
part
of
the
matter
and
accomplished
in
habits
of
business
mr
rowland
was
happy
to
let
the
to
mr
hope
not
even
taking
advantage
as
his
lady
advised
of
its
being
peculiarly
fit
for
a
surgeon
residence
from
its
having
a
door
round
the
corner
made
to
be
a
to
raise
the
rent
mr
rowland
behaved
handsomely
about
everything
rent
alterations
painting
and
papering
and
laying
out
the
garden
anew
mr
grey
bestirred
himself
to
get
the
affairs
at
birmingham
settled
and
he
was
soon
enabled
to
inform
mr
hope
that
hester
fortune
was
ascertained
and
that
it
was
smaller
than
could
have
been
wished
he
believed
his
cousins
would
have
seventy
pounds
each
and
no
more
it
was
some
compensation
for
the
mortifying
nature
of
this
announcement
that
mr
hope
evidently
did
not
care
at
all
about
the
matter
he
was
not
an
ambitious
nor
yet
a
luxurious
man
his
practice
supplied
an
income
sufficient
for
the
ease
of
young
married
people
and
it
was
on
the
increase
no
one
seemed
to
doubt
for
a
moment
that
margaret
would
live
with
her
sister
there
was
no
other
home
for
her
she
and
hester
had
never
been
parted
there
seemed
no
reason
for
their
parting
now
and
every
inducement
for
their
remaining
together
margaret
did
not
dream
of
objecting
to
this
she
only
made
it
a
condition
that
fifty
pounds
of
her
yearly
income
should
go
into
the
thus
saving
her
from
obligation
to
any
one
for
her
maintenance
living
was
so
cheap
in
deerbrook
that
margaret
was
assured
that
she
would
render
herself
quite
independent
by
paying
fifty
pounds
for
her
share
of
the
household
expenses
and
reserving
twenty
for
her
personal
wants
both
the
sisters
were
surprised
to
find
how
much
pleasure
they
took
in
the
preparations
for
this
marriage
they
could
not
have
believed
it
and
but
that
they
were
too
happy
to
feel
any
kind
of
contempt
they
would
have
despised
themselves
for
it
but
such
contempt
would
have
been
misplaced
all
things
are
according
to
the
ideas
and
feelings
with
which
they
are
connected
and
if
as
old
george
herbert
says
dusting
a
room
is
an
act
of
religious
grace
when
it
is
done
from
a
feeling
of
religious
duty
furnishing
a
house
is
a
process
of
high
enjoyment
when
it
is
the
preparation
of
a
home
for
happy
love
the
dwelling
is
hung
all
round
with
bright
anticipations
and
crowded
with
blissful
thoughts
spoken
by
none
perhaps
but
present
to
all
on
this
table
and
by
this
snug
fireside
will
the
cheerful
winter
breakfast
go
forward
when
each
is
about
to
enter
on
the
gladsome
business
of
the
day
and
that
sofa
will
be
drawn
out
and
those
will
be
closed
when
the
intellectual
pleasures
of
the
evening
the
rewards
of
the
laborious
day
begin
those
will
stand
open
all
the
summer
noon
and
the
flower
stands
will
be
gay
and
fragrant
and
the
shaded
parlour
will
be
the
cool
retreat
of
the
wearied
husband
when
he
comes
in
to
rest
from
his
professional
toils
there
will
stand
the
books
destined
to
refresh
and
refine
his
higher
tastes
and
there
the
music
with
which
the
wife
will
indulge
him
here
will
they
first
feel
what
it
is
to
have
a
home
of
their
own
where
they
will
first
enjoy
the
privacy
of
it
the
security
the
freedom
the
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
others
the
sacredness
in
their
own
here
they
will
first
exercise
the
graces
of
hospitality
and
the
responsibility
of
control
here
will
they
feel
that
they
have
attained
the
great
of
their
life
the
of
their
individual
lot
but
only
the
of
their
activity
such
is
the
work
of
furnishing
a
house
once
in
a
lifetime
it
may
be
a
welcome
task
to
the
fine
lady
decking
her
anew
to
gratify
her
ambition
or
divert
her
it
may
be
a
satisfactory
labour
to
the
elderly
couple
settling
themselves
afresh
when
their
children
are
dispersed
abroad
and
it
becomes
necessary
to
discard
the
furniture
that
the
boys
have
battered
and
spoiled
it
may
be
a
refined
amusement
to
the
selfish
man
of
taste
wishing
to
prolong
or
recall
the
pleasures
of
foreign
travel
but
to
none
is
it
the
conscious
delight
that
it
is
to
young
lovers
and
their
sympathising
friends
whether
the
scene
be
the
two
rooms
of
the
hopeful
young
artisan
about
to
bring
home
his
bride
from
service
or
the
palace
of
a
nobleman
enriched
with
intellectual
luxuries
for
the
lady
of
his
adoration
or
the
quiet
abode
of
an
unambitious
professional
man
whose
aim
is
privacy
and
comfort
margaret
delight
in
the
process
of
preparation
was
the
most
intense
of
all
that
was
felt
except
perhaps
by
one
person
mrs
grey
and
sophia
enjoyed
the
bustle
and
the
consequence
and
the
exercise
of
their
feminine
talents
and
the
gossip
of
the
village
and
the
spitefulness
of
mrs
rowland
criticisms
when
she
had
recovered
from
her
delight
at
her
brother
escape
from
hester
and
had
leisure
to
be
offended
at
mr
hope
marrying
into
the
grey
connexion
so
decidedly
the
children
relished
the
mystery
of
buying
their
presents
secretly
and
hiding
them
from
their
cousins
till
the
day
before
the
wedding
sydney
was
proud
to
help
margaret
in
training
the
chrysanthemums
putting
the
garden
into
winter
trim
and
in
planting
round
the
walls
of
the
surgery
with
large
evergreens
mr
grey
came
down
almost
every
evening
to
suggest
and
approve
and
morris
left
her
needle
now
busy
from
morning
till
night
in
hester
service
to
admire
and
to
speak
her
wishes
when
desired
about
the
preparations
in
her
department
morris
another
maid
and
a
were
the
only
servants
and
morris
was
to
have
everything
as
she
liked
best
for
her
own
region
but
margaret
was
as
eager
and
interested
as
all
the
rest
together
her
heart
was
light
for
her
sister
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
was
capable
of
thought
she
believed
that
hester
was
going
to
be
happy
her
own
gain
was
almost
too
great
for
gratitude
a
home
a
brother
and
relief
from
the
responsibility
of
her
sister
peace
as
often
as
she
thought
of
these
blessings
she
looked
almost
as
bright
as
hester
herself
how
was
mr
hope
all
this
while
well
and
growing
happier
every
day
he
believed
himself
a
perfectly
happy
man
and
looked
back
with
wonder
to
the
struggle
which
it
had
cost
him
to
accept
his
present
lot
he
was
not
only
entirely
recovered
from
his
accident
before
the
rich
month
of
october
came
in
but
truly
thankful
for
it
as
the
means
of
bringing
to
his
knowledge
sooner
at
least
the
devoted
affection
which
he
had
inspired
it
can
not
but
be
animating
flattering
delightful
to
a
man
of
strong
domestic
tendencies
to
know
himself
the
object
of
the
exclusive
attachment
of
a
and
woman
and
when
in
addition
to
this
her
society
affords
the
delight
of
mental
accomplishment
and
personal
beauty
such
as
hester
he
must
be
a
churl
indeed
if
he
does
not
greatly
enjoy
the
present
and
indulge
in
sweet
anticipations
for
the
future
hope
also
brought
the
whole
power
of
his
will
to
bear
upon
his
circumstances
he
dwelt
upon
all
the
happiest
features
of
his
lot
and
in
his
admiration
of
hester
thought
as
little
as
he
could
of
margaret
he
had
the
daily
delight
of
seeing
how
he
constituted
the
happiness
of
her
whose
life
was
to
be
devoted
to
him
he
heard
of
nothing
but
rejoicings
and
blessings
and
fully
believed
himself
the
happy
man
that
every
one
declared
him
he
dwelt
on
the
prospect
of
a
home
full
of
domestic
attachment
of
rational
pursuit
of
intellectual
resource
and
looked
forward
to
a
life
of
religious
usefulness
of
vigorous
devotedness
to
others
of
which
he
trusted
that
his
first
act
of
and
its
consequences
were
the
earnest
and
the
pledge
he
had
never
for
a
moment
repented
what
he
had
done
and
now
when
he
hastily
recurred
to
the
struggle
it
had
cost
him
it
was
chiefly
to
moralise
on
the
of
men
in
their
wishes
and
to
be
grateful
for
his
own
present
satisfaction
a
few
cold
misgivings
had
troubled
him
and
continued
to
trouble
him
if
hester
at
any
time
looked
at
all
less
bright
and
serene
than
usual
but
he
concluded
that
these
were
merely
the
which
necessarily
chequer
all
the
sunshine
of
this
world
he
told
himself
that
when
two
human
beings
become
closely
dependent
on
each
other
their
peace
must
hang
upon
the
variations
in
one
another
moods
and
that
moods
must
vary
in
all
mortals
he
persuaded
himself
that
this
was
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
relation
and
to
be
received
as
a
slight
against
the
unfathomable
blessings
of
sympathy
he
concluded
that
he
had
deceived
himself
about
his
feelings
for
margaret
he
must
have
been
mistaken
for
he
could
now
receive
from
her
the
opening
confidence
of
a
sister
he
could
cordially
agree
to
the
arrangement
of
her
living
with
them
he
could
with
her
in
the
preparation
for
the
coming
time
without
any
emotion
which
was
inconsistent
with
his
duty
to
hester
with
unconscious
prudence
he
merely
said
this
to
himself
and
let
it
pass
reverting
to
his
beautiful
his
happy
his
own
hester
and
the
future
years
over
which
her
image
spread
its
sunshine
the
one
person
who
relished
the
task
of
preparation
more
than
margaret
herself
was
hope
every
advance
in
the
work
seemed
to
bring
him
nearer
to
the
source
of
the
happiness
he
felt
every
day
of
which
they
marked
the
lapse
appeared
to
open
wider
the
portals
of
that
home
which
he
was
now
more
than
ever
habituated
to
view
as
the
sanctuary
of
duty
of
holiness
and
of
peace
all
remarked
on
mr
hope
altered
looks
the
shyness
and
coldness
with
which
he
had
seemed
to
receive
the
first
congratulations
on
his
engagement
and
which
excited
wonder
in
many
and
uneasiness
in
a
few
had
now
given
place
to
a
gaiety
only
subdued
by
a
more
tender
happiness
even
mrs
grey
need
no
longer
watch
his
countenance
and
manner
and
weigh
his
words
with
anxiety
and
try
to
forget
that
there
was
a
secret
between
them
one
ground
of
mr
hope
confidence
was
hester
candour
she
had
truly
told
her
sister
she
felt
it
was
no
time
for
pride
when
he
offered
himself
to
her
her
pride
was
strong
but
there
was
something
in
her
as
much
stronger
in
force
than
her
pride
as
it
was
higher
in
its
nature
and
she
had
owned
her
love
with
a
frankness
which
had
commanded
his
esteem
as
much
as
it
engaged
his
generosity
she
had
made
a
no
less
open
avowal
of
her
faults
to
him
she
had
acknowledged
the
imperfections
of
her
temper
the
sorest
of
her
troubles
both
at
the
outset
of
their
engagement
and
often
since
at
first
the
confession
was
made
in
an
undoubting
confidence
that
she
should
be
reasonable
and
amiable
and
serene
henceforth
for
ever
while
she
had
him
by
her
side
subsequent
experience
had
moderated
this
confidence
into
a
hope
that
by
his
example
and
under
his
guidance
she
should
be
enabled
to
surmount
her
failings
he
shared
this
hope
with
her
pledged
himself
to
her
and
to
himself
to
forbear
as
he
would
be
forborne
to
aid
her
and
to
honour
her
efforts
and
he
frequently
declared
for
his
own
satisfaction
and
hers
that
all
must
be
safe
between
them
while
such
generous
candour
was
the
foundation
of
their
intercourse
a
generosity
and
candour
in
whose
noble
presence
superficial
failings
of
temper
were
as
nothing
he
admitted
that
her
temper
was
not
perfect
and
he
must
ever
remember
his
own
foreknowledge
of
this
but
he
must
also
bear
in
mind
whence
this
foreknowledge
was
derived
and
pay
everlasting
honour
to
the
greatness
of
soul
to
which
he
owed
it
an
early
day
in
december
was
fixed
for
the
marriage
and
no
cause
of
delay
occurred
there
happened
to
be
no
patients
so
dangerously
ill
as
to
prevent
mr
hope
absence
for
his
brief
wedding
trip
the
were
as
nearly
punctual
as
could
be
expected
and
the
house
was
all
but
ready
the
wedding
was
really
to
take
place
therefore
though
mrs
rowland
gave
out
that
in
her
opinion
the
engagement
had
been
a
surprisingly
short
one
that
she
hoped
the
young
people
knew
what
they
were
about
while
all
their
friends
were
in
such
a
hurry
that
it
was
a
wretched
time
of
year
for
a
wedding
and
that
in
her
opinion
it
would
have
been
much
pleasanter
to
wait
for
fine
spring
weather
as
it
happened
the
weather
was
finer
than
it
had
been
almost
any
day
of
the
preceding
spring
the
day
before
the
wedding
was
sunny
and
mild
as
an
october
morning
and
the
fires
seemed
to
be
blazing
more
for
show
than
use
when
mr
hope
dropped
in
at
the
greys
at
two
he
found
the
family
dining
it
was
a
fancy
of
mrs
grey
to
dine
early
on
what
she
considered
busy
days
an
early
dinner
was
with
her
a
specific
for
the
despatch
of
business
on
this
day
the
arrangement
was
rather
absurd
for
the
great
evil
of
the
time
was
that
everything
was
done
except
what
could
not
be
transacted
till
the
evening
and
the
hours
were
actually
hanging
heavy
on
the
hands
of
some
members
of
the
family
morris
had
packed
hester
clothes
for
her
little
journey
and
put
out
of
sight
all
the
mourning
of
both
sisters
except
what
they
actually
had
on
sophia
dress
for
the
next
morning
was
laid
out
in
readiness
to
be
put
on
and
the
preparations
for
the
breakfast
were
as
complete
as
they
could
be
twenty
hours
beforehand
it
only
remained
to
take
a
final
view
of
the
house
in
the
evening
when
the
presents
were
to
be
discovered
and
to
cut
the
in
the
interval
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
conversation
flagged
every
one
was
dull
and
it
was
a
relief
to
the
rest
when
mr
hope
proposed
to
hester
to
take
a
walk
mrs
rowland
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
a
walk
on
a
december
afternoon
if
she
had
happened
to
know
of
the
circumstance
but
others
than
lovers
might
have
considered
it
pleasant
the
sun
was
still
an
hour
from
its
setting
and
high
in
the
pale
heaven
was
the
large
moon
ready
to
shine
upon
the
fields
and
woods
and
shed
a
milder
day
no
frost
had
yet
bound
up
the
earth
it
had
only
stripped
the
trees
with
a
touch
as
gentle
as
that
of
the
no
wintry
gusts
had
yet
swept
through
the
woods
and
all
there
was
this
day
as
still
as
in
the
autumn
noon
when
the
nut
is
heard
to
drop
upon
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
light
squirrel
is
startled
at
the
rustle
along
its
own
path
as
a
matter
of
course
the
lovers
took
their
way
to
the
spring
in
the
vernon
woods
the
spot
which
had
witnessed
more
of
their
confidence
than
any
other
in
the
alcove
above
it
they
had
taken
shelter
from
the
summer
storm
and
the
autumn
shower
they
had
sat
on
its
brink
for
many
an
hour
when
the
pure
depths
of
its
rocky
basin
seemed
like
coolness
itself
in
the
midst
of
heat
and
when
falling
leaves
fluttered
down
the
wind
and
dimpled
the
surface
of
the
water
they
now
paused
once
more
under
shelter
of
the
rock
which
overhung
one
side
of
the
basin
and
listened
to
the
trickle
of
the
spring
if
aside
the
devil
turned
for
envy
in
the
presence
of
the
pair
in
paradise
it
might
be
thought
that
he
would
take
flight
from
this
scene
also
from
the
view
of
this
resting
of
the
lovers
on
their
marriage
eve
when
the
last
sun
of
their
separate
lives
was
sinking
and
the
separate
business
of
their
existence
was
finished
and
their
paths
had
met
before
the
gate
of
their
paradise
and
they
were
only
waiting
for
the
portal
to
open
to
them
but
there
was
that
on
hester
brow
which
would
have
made
the
devil
look
closer
she
was
discomposed
and
her
replies
to
what
was
said
were
brief
and
not
much
to
the
purpose
after
a
few
moments
silence
mr
hope
said
gaily
there
is
something
on
our
minds
hester
come
what
is
it
do
not
say
minds
you
know
you
never
have
anything
on
yours
i
believe
it
is
against
your
nature
and
i
know
it
is
against
your
principles
do
not
say
minds
i
say
it
because
it
is
true
i
never
see
you
look
grave
but
my
heart
is
as
heavy
but
never
mind
that
what
is
the
matter
love
nothing
sighed
hester
nothing
that
any
one
can
help
people
may
say
what
they
will
edward
but
there
can
be
no
escape
from
living
alone
in
this
world
after
all
what
you
mean
i
mean
what
no
one
not
even
you
can
gainsay
i
mean
that
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
that
we
have
disappointments
and
anxieties
and
remorse
and
many
many
kinds
of
trouble
that
we
can
never
tell
to
any
human
being
that
none
have
any
concern
with
that
we
should
never
dare
to
tell
we
must
be
alone
in
the
world
after
all
where
is
your
faith
while
you
feel
so
asked
edward
smiling
do
you
really
think
that
confidence
proceeds
only
while
people
believe
each
other
perfect
while
they
have
not
anxieties
and
disappointments
and
remorse
do
you
not
feel
that
our
faults
or
rather
our
failures
bind
us
together
our
faults
bind
us
together
exclaimed
hester
oh
how
happy
i
should
be
if
i
could
think
that
we
can
not
but
think
it
we
shall
find
it
so
love
every
day
when
our
faith
fails
when
we
are
discouraged
instead
of
fighting
the
battle
with
our
faithlessness
alone
we
shall
come
to
one
another
for
courage
for
stimulus
for
help
to
see
the
bright
the
true
side
of
everything
that
supposes
that
we
can
do
so
said
hester
sadly
but
i
can
not
i
have
all
my
life
intended
to
repose
entire
confidence
and
i
have
never
done
it
yet
yes
you
have
in
me
you
can
not
help
it
you
think
that
you
can
not
only
because
you
mean
more
by
reposing
confidence
than
others
do
your
spirit
is
too
noble
too
ingenuous
too
humble
for
concealment
you
can
not
help
yourself
hester
you
have
fully
confided
in
me
and
you
will
go
on
to
do
so
hester
shook
her
head
mournfully
i
have
done
it
hitherto
with
you
and
with
you
only
said
she
and
the
mason
has
been
you
know
the
reason
the
same
which
made
me
own
all
to
you
that
first
evening
in
the
shrubbery
ah
i
see
you
think
that
this
is
a
lasting
security
that
as
you
will
never
change
i
never
shall
but
you
do
not
understand
me
wholly
yet
there
is
something
that
you
do
not
know
that
i
can
not
make
you
believe
but
you
will
find
it
true
when
it
is
too
late
no
good
influence
is
permanent
with
me
many
all
have
been
tried
and
the
evil
that
is
in
me
gets
the
better
of
them
all
at
last
she
snatched
her
hand
from
her
lover
and
covered
her
face
to
hide
her
tears
i
shall
not
contradict
you
hester
said
he
tenderly
because
you
will
only
abase
yourself
the
more
in
your
own
eyes
but
tell
me
again
where
is
your
faith
while
you
let
spectres
from
the
past
glide
over
into
the
future
to
terrify
you
i
say
and
not
because
i
am
not
terrified
i
fear
nothing
i
trust
you
and
i
trust
him
who
brought
us
together
and
moved
you
to
lay
open
your
honest
heart
to
me
my
sick
heart
edward
it
is
sick
with
fear
i
thought
i
had
got
over
it
i
thought
you
had
cured
it
and
that
now
on
this
day
of
all
days
i
should
have
been
full
of
your
spirit
of
the
spirit
which
made
me
so
happy
a
few
weeks
ago
that
i
was
sure
i
should
never
fall
back
again
but
i
am
disappointed
in
myself
edward
wholly
disappointed
in
myself
i
have
often
been
so
before
but
this
time
it
is
fatal
i
shall
never
make
you
happy
edward
neither
god
nor
man
requires
it
of
you
hester
dismiss
it
oh
hear
me
cried
hester
in
great
agitation
i
vowed
to
devote
myself
to
my
father
happiness
when
my
mother
died
i
promised
to
place
the
most
absolute
confidence
in
him
i
failed
i
fancied
miserable
things
i
fancied
he
loved
margaret
better
and
that
i
was
not
necessary
to
him
and
i
was
too
proud
too
selfish
to
tell
him
so
and
when
he
was
dying
and
commended
margaret
and
me
to
each
other
oh
so
solemnly
i
am
sure
it
was
in
compassion
to
me
and
i
shrank
from
it
even
at
that
moment
when
we
came
here
and
margaret
and
i
felt
ourselves
alone
among
strangers
we
promised
the
same
confidence
i
vowed
to
my
father
the
next
thing
was
perhaps
you
saw
it
i
grew
jealous
of
margaret
having
another
friend
though
maria
was
as
ready
to
be
my
friend
as
hers
if
i
had
only
been
worthy
of
it
up
to
this
hour
at
this
very
moment
i
believe
i
am
jealous
of
maria
and
with
margaret
before
my
eyes
margaret
who
loves
me
as
her
own
soul
and
yet
has
never
felt
one
moment
jealousy
of
you
i
am
certain
if
her
heart
was
known
we
will
rejoice
then
in
margaret
peace
of
mind
the
reward
of
her
faith
oh
so
i
do
i
bless
god
that
she
is
rewarded
better
than
by
me
but
you
see
how
it
is
you
see
how
i
poison
every
one
life
i
never
made
anybody
happy
i
never
shall
make
anyone
happy
let
us
put
the
thought
of
making
happiness
out
of
our
minds
altogether
said
hope
i
am
persuaded
that
half
the
misery
in
the
world
comes
of
straining
after
happiness
after
our
own
said
hester
i
could
give
up
my
own
but
yours
i
can
not
put
yours
out
of
my
thoughts
yes
you
can
and
you
will
when
you
give
your
faith
fair
play
why
can
not
you
trust
god
with
my
happiness
as
well
as
your
own
and
why
can
not
you
trust
me
to
do
without
happiness
if
it
be
necessary
as
well
as
yourself
i
know
said
hester
that
you
are
as
willing
to
forego
all
for
me
as
i
am
for
you
but
i
can
not
i
dare
not
consent
to
the
risk
oh
edward
if
ever
you
wished
to
give
me
ease
do
what
i
ask
now
give
me
up
i
shall
make
you
wretched
give
me
up
edward
hope
spirit
was
for
one
instant
wrapped
in
storm
he
recoiled
from
the
future
and
at
the
moment
of
recoil
came
this
offer
of
release
one
moment
thought
of
freedom
one
moment
thought
of
margaret
convulsed
his
soul
but
before
he
could
speak
the
tempest
had
passed
away
hester
face
frightfully
agitated
was
upraised
his
countenance
seemed
heavenly
to
her
when
he
smiled
upon
her
and
replied
i
will
not
you
are
mine
and
as
i
said
before
all
our
failures
all
our
must
bind
us
the
more
to
each
other
then
you
must
sustain
me
you
must
cure
me
you
must
do
what
no
one
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
do
but
above
all
edward
you
must
never
happen
what
may
cast
me
off
that
is
as
you
say
what
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
do
said
he
smiling
your
father
tenderness
was
greatest
at
the
last
and
margaret
loves
you
you
know
as
her
own
soul
let
us
avoid
promises
but
let
us
rest
upon
these
truths
and
now
continued
he
as
he
drew
nearer
to
her
and
made
his
shoulder
a
for
her
throbbing
head
i
have
heard
your
thoughts
for
the
future
will
you
hear
mine
hester
made
an
effort
to
still
her
weeping
i
said
just
now
that
i
believe
half
the
misery
in
our
lives
is
owing
to
straining
after
happiness
and
i
think
too
that
much
of
our
sin
is
owing
to
our
disturbing
ourselves
too
much
about
our
duty
instead
of
yielding
a
glad
obedience
from
hour
to
hour
it
is
the
weakness
of
many
of
us
to
stretch
far
forward
into
the
future
which
is
beyond
our
present
reach
and
torment
ourselves
with
apprehensions
of
sin
which
we
should
be
ashamed
of
if
they
related
to
pain
and
danger
oh
if
you
could
prove
to
me
that
such
is
my
weakness
cried
hester
i
believe
that
it
is
yours
and
i
know
that
it
is
my
own
my
hester
we
must
watch
over
one
another
tell
me
is
it
not
faithless
to
let
our
hearts
be
troubled
about
possible
evil
which
we
can
not
at
the
moment
of
the
trouble
prevent
and
are
we
not
sacrificing
what
is
at
the
time
of
the
most
importance
our
repose
of
mind
the
holiness
the
religion
of
the
hour
i
know
i
have
defiled
the
holiness
of
this
hour
said
hester
humbly
but
as
my
thoughts
were
troubled
was
it
not
better
to
speak
them
i
could
not
but
speak
them
you
can
not
but
do
and
speak
what
is
most
honourable
and
true
and
generous
hester
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
i
would
fain
have
you
trust
for
the
future
as
well
as
the
present
to
the
impulse
of
the
hour
surely
love
the
probation
of
the
hour
is
enough
for
the
strength
of
every
one
of
us
far
far
too
much
for
me
at
times
too
much
for
all
well
then
what
have
we
to
do
to
rest
the
care
of
each
other
happiness
upon
him
whose
care
it
is
to
be
ready
to
do
without
it
as
we
would
hold
ourselves
ready
to
do
without
this
or
that
or
the
other
comfort
or
supposed
means
of
happiness
depend
upon
it
this
happiness
is
too
subtle
and
too
divine
a
thing
for
our
management
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
to
enjoy
it
when
it
comes
men
say
of
it
it
is
here
there
but
never
has
man
laid
hold
of
it
with
a
voluntary
grasp
but
we
can
banish
it
said
hester
alas
yes
and
what
else
do
we
do
at
the
very
moment
when
we
afflict
ourselves
about
the
future
surely
our
business
is
to
keep
our
hearts
open
for
it
holy
and
at
peace
from
moment
to
moment
from
day
to
day
and
yet
is
it
not
our
privilege
said
at
least
to
be
so
to
look
before
and
after
i
am
not
sure
however
that
i
always
think
this
a
privilege
i
long
sometimes
to
be
any
bird
of
the
air
that
i
might
live
for
the
present
moment
alone
let
us
be
so
far
birds
of
the
air
free
as
they
neither
toiling
nor
spinning
out
anxious
thoughts
for
the
future
but
why
with
all
this
should
we
not
use
our
human
privilege
of
looking
before
and
after
to
enrich
and
sanctify
the
present
should
we
enjoy
the
in
june
as
we
do
if
we
knew
nothing
of
and
had
never
heard
of
harvest
and
how
should
you
and
i
feel
at
this
moment
sitting
here
if
we
had
no
recollection
of
walks
in
shrubberies
and
no
prospect
of
a
home
and
a
lifetime
to
spend
in
it
to
make
this
moment
sacred
look
at
those
shall
we
change
lots
with
them
no
no
let
us
look
forward
but
how
we
can
not
persuade
ourselves
that
we
are
better
than
we
are
for
the
sake
of
making
the
future
bright
true
and
therefore
it
must
be
god
future
and
not
our
own
that
we
must
look
forward
to
that
is
for
confessors
and
martyrs
said
hester
they
can
look
peacefully
before
and
after
when
there
is
a
bright
life
and
a
world
of
hopes
lying
behind
and
nothing
around
and
before
them
but
ignominy
and
poverty
or
prison
or
torture
or
death
they
can
do
this
but
not
such
as
i
god
future
is
enough
for
them
the
triumph
of
truth
and
holiness
but
and
i
believe
it
would
be
enough
for
you
in
their
situation
hester
i
believe
you
could
be
a
martyr
for
opinion
why
can
not
you
and
i
brave
the
suffering
of
our
own
faults
as
we
would
meet
sickness
or
bereavement
from
heaven
and
torture
and
death
from
men
is
this
the
prospect
in
view
of
which
you
marry
me
it
is
the
prospect
in
view
of
which
all
of
us
are
ever
living
since
we
are
all
faulty
and
must
all
suffer
but
marriage
justifies
a
holier
and
happier
anticipation
the
faults
of
human
beings
are
temporary
features
of
their
prospect
their
virtues
are
the
firm
ground
under
their
feet
and
the
bright
arch
over
their
heads
is
it
not
so
if
so
how
selfish
how
ungrateful
have
i
been
in
making
myself
and
you
so
miserable
but
i
do
so
fear
myself
let
us
fear
nothing
but
give
all
our
care
to
the
day
and
the
hour
i
am
confident
that
this
is
the
true
obedience
and
the
true
wisdom
if
the
temper
of
the
hour
is
right
nothing
is
wrong
and
i
am
sure
if
the
temper
of
the
hour
is
wrong
nothing
is
right
if
one
could
always
remember
this
if
we
could
always
remember
this
we
should
perhaps
find
ourselves
a
little
above
the
angels
instead
of
being
like
the
serene
the
fenelons
of
our
race
a
little
below
them
we
shall
not
always
remember
it
love
but
we
must
remind
each
other
as
faithfully
as
may
be
you
must
bring
me
here
when
i
forget
said
hester
this
spring
will
always
murmur
the
truth
to
me
the
temper
of
the
hour
is
right
nothing
is
wrong
how
wrong
has
my
temper
been
within
this
hour
let
it
pass
my
hester
we
are
all
faithless
at
times
and
without
the
excuse
of
meek
and
anxious
love
is
it
possible
that
the
moon
casts
that
shadow
the
dark
dark
hour
is
gone
said
hester
smiling
as
she
looked
up
and
the
moon
shone
on
her
face
nothing
is
wrong
who
would
have
believed
an
hour
ago
that
i
should
now
say
so
when
you
would
have
given
me
up
said
hope
smiling
oh
let
us
forget
it
all
let
us
go
somewhere
else
who
will
say
this
is
winter
is
it
october
or
first
mild
day
of
march
it
might
be
either
there
is
not
a
breath
to
chill
us
and
these
leaves
what
a
soft
autumn
carpet
they
make
they
have
no
wintry
crispness
yet
there
was
one
inexhaustible
subject
to
which
they
now
recurred
mr
hope
family
he
told
over
again
what
hester
was
never
weary
of
hearing
how
his
sisters
would
cherish
her
whenever
circumstances
should
allow
them
to
meet
how
emily
and
she
would
suit
best
but
how
anne
would
look
up
to
her
as
for
frank
but
this
representation
of
what
frank
would
say
and
think
and
do
was
somewhat
checked
and
impaired
by
the
recollection
that
frank
was
just
about
this
time
receiving
the
letter
in
which
margaret
superiority
to
hester
was
pretty
plainly
set
forth
the
answer
to
that
letter
would
arrive
some
time
or
other
and
the
anticipated
awkwardness
of
that
circumstance
caused
some
unpleasant
feelings
at
this
moment
as
it
had
often
done
before
during
the
last
few
weeks
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
set
the
matter
right
with
frank
as
was
already
done
with
emily
and
anne
the
first
letter
might
occasion
some
difficulty
frank
was
passed
over
lightly
and
the
foreground
of
the
picture
of
family
welcome
was
occupied
by
emily
and
anne
it
was
almost
an
hour
from
their
leaving
the
spring
before
the
lovers
reached
home
they
were
neither
cold
nor
tired
they
were
neither
merry
nor
sad
the
traces
of
tears
were
on
hester
face
but
even
margaret
was
satisfied
when
she
saw
her
leaning
on
edward
arm
receiving
the
presents
of
the
children
where
alone
the
children
would
present
them
in
the
new
house
there
was
no
fancy
about
the
arrangements
no
ceremony
about
the
cake
and
the
ring
to
which
hester
did
not
submit
with
perfect
grace
notwithstanding
the
traces
of
her
tears
she
had
never
looked
so
beautiful
the
same
opinion
was
repeated
the
next
morning
by
all
the
many
who
saw
her
in
church
or
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
her
way
to
and
from
it
no
wedding
was
ever
kept
a
secret
in
deerbrook
and
mr
hope
was
the
one
in
which
concealment
was
least
of
all
possible
the
church
was
half
full
and
the
path
to
the
was
lined
with
gazers
those
who
were
obliged
to
remain
at
home
looked
abroad
from
their
doors
so
that
all
were
gratified
more
or
less
every
one
on
mr
grey
premises
had
a
holiday
including
miss
young
though
mrs
rowland
did
not
see
why
her
children
should
lose
a
day
instruction
because
a
distant
cousin
of
mr
grey
was
married
the
marriage
was
made
far
too
much
a
fuss
of
for
her
taste
and
she
vowed
that
whenever
she
parted
with
her
own
matilda
there
should
be
a
much
greater
refinement
in
the
mode
every
one
else
appeared
satisfied
the
sun
shone
the
bells
rang
and
the
servants
drank
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
margaret
succeeded
in
swallowing
her
tears
and
was
in
her
inmost
soul
thankful
for
hester
and
herself
the
letters
to
mr
hope
sisters
and
brother
left
open
for
the
signatures
of
edward
and
hester
hope
were
closed
and
despatched
and
the
news
was
communicated
to
two
or
three
of
the
ibbotsons
nearest
friends
at
birmingham
mr
and
mrs
grey
agreed
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
a
wedding
was
to
be
sure
a
most
fatiguing
affair
for
quiet
people
like
themselves
but
that
nothing
could
have
gone
off
better
chapter
fifteen
maria
and
margaret
mr
hope
professional
duties
would
not
permit
him
to
be
long
absent
even
on
such
an
occasion
as
his
wedding
journey
the
young
couple
went
only
to
oxford
and
were
to
return
in
a
week
margaret
thought
that
this
week
never
would
be
over
it
was
not
only
that
she
longed
for
rest
in
a
home
once
more
and
was
eager
to
repose
upon
her
new
privilege
of
having
a
brother
she
was
also
anxious
about
hester
anxious
to
be
convinced
by
the
observation
of
the
eye
and
the
hearing
of
the
ear
that
her
sister
was
enjoying
that
peace
of
spirit
which
reason
seemed
to
declare
must
be
hers
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
how
much
margaret
attachment
to
her
sister
was
deepened
and
strengthened
by
the
incessant
solicitude
she
had
felt
for
her
ever
since
this
attachment
had
grown
out
of
the
companionship
of
their
childhood
she
could
scarcely
remember
the
time
when
she
had
not
been
in
a
state
of
either
hope
or
fear
for
hester
hope
that
in
some
new
circumstances
she
would
be
happy
at
last
or
dread
lest
these
new
circumstances
should
fail
as
all
preceding
influences
had
failed
if
hester
had
been
less
candid
and
less
generous
than
she
was
her
sister
affection
might
have
given
way
under
the
repeated
trials
and
disappointments
it
had
had
to
sustain
and
there
were
times
when
margaret
patience
given
way
and
she
had
for
a
brief
while
wished
and
almost
resolved
that
she
could
and
would
regard
with
indifference
the
state
of
mind
of
one
who
was
not
reasonable
and
who
seemed
incapable
of
being
contented
but
such
resolutions
of
indifference
dissolved
before
her
sister
next
manifestations
of
generosity
or
appeals
to
the
forgiveness
of
those
about
her
margaret
always
ended
by
supposing
herself
the
cause
of
the
evil
that
she
had
been
inconsiderate
that
she
could
not
allow
sufficiently
for
a
sensitiveness
greater
than
her
own
and
above
all
that
she
was
not
fully
worthy
of
such
affection
as
hester
not
sufficient
for
such
a
mind
and
heart
she
had
looked
forward
with
ardent
expectation
when
she
was
happiest
and
with
sickly
dread
when
she
was
depressed
to
the
event
of
hester
marriage
as
that
which
must
decide
whether
she
could
be
happy
or
whether
her
life
was
to
be
throughout
the
scene
of
conflict
that
its
opening
years
had
been
hester
connexion
was
all
that
she
could
have
desired
and
far
beyond
her
utmost
hopes
this
was
one
of
a
thousand
one
whom
she
was
ready
to
consider
a
good
angel
sent
to
shed
peace
over
her
sister
life
and
during
the
months
of
her
engagement
she
had
kept
anxiety
at
bay
and
resigned
herself
to
the
delights
of
gratitude
and
of
sweet
anticipations
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
her
own
responsibilities
might
be
considered
at
an
end
she
had
delivered
hester
happiness
over
into
the
charge
of
one
who
would
cherish
it
better
and
more
successfully
than
she
had
done
and
she
could
not
but
feel
the
relief
of
the
freedom
she
had
gained
but
neither
could
she
repress
her
anxiety
to
know
at
the
outset
whether
all
was
indeed
as
well
as
she
had
till
now
undoubtingly
supposed
that
it
would
be
margaret
attachment
to
her
sister
would
have
been
in
greater
danger
of
being
worn
out
but
for
the
existence
of
a
closer
sympathy
between
them
than
any
one
but
themselves
and
perhaps
morris
was
aware
of
margaret
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
in
hester
place
her
temper
would
have
been
exactly
what
hester
was
in
its
least
happy
characteristics
she
had
tendencies
to
jealousy
and
if
not
to
morbid
and
to
dissatisfaction
with
present
circumstances
she
was
indebted
for
this
she
knew
to
her
being
occupied
with
her
sister
and
yet
more
to
the
perpetual
warning
held
up
before
her
eyes
this
conviction
generated
no
sense
of
superiority
in
margaret
interfered
in
no
degree
with
the
reverence
she
entertained
for
hester
a
reverence
rather
enhanced
than
impaired
by
the
tender
compassion
with
which
she
regarded
her
mental
conflicts
and
sufferings
every
movement
of
irritability
in
herself
and
she
was
conscious
of
many
alarmed
and
humbled
her
but
at
the
same
time
enabled
her
better
to
make
allowance
for
her
sister
and
every
harsh
word
and
unreasonable
mood
of
hester
by
restoring
her
to
her
and
stimulating
her
magnanimity
made
her
sensible
that
she
owed
much
of
her
power
over
herself
to
that
circumstance
which
kept
the
necessity
of
it
perpetually
before
her
mind
for
the
same
reason
that
men
hate
those
whom
they
have
injured
margaret
loved
with
unusual
fervour
the
sister
with
whom
she
had
to
forbear
for
the
same
reason
that
the
children
even
the
affectionate
children
of
tyrannical
or
lax
parents
love
liberty
and
conscientiousness
above
all
else
margaret
was
in
practice
gentle
and
forgetful
of
self
for
the
same
reason
that
the
afflicted
are
looked
upon
by
the
as
sacred
margaret
regarded
her
sister
with
a
reverence
which
preserved
her
patience
from
being
spent
and
her
attachment
from
wasting
away
the
first
letter
from
her
brother
and
sister
had
been
opened
in
great
internal
agitation
all
was
well
however
it
was
certain
that
all
was
well
for
while
hester
said
not
one
word
about
being
happy
she
was
full
of
thought
for
others
she
knew
that
margaret
meant
to
take
possession
of
the
to
go
home
a
few
days
before
the
arrival
of
the
travellers
in
order
to
make
all
comfortable
for
them
hester
begged
that
she
would
take
care
to
be
well
amused
during
these
few
days
perhaps
she
might
induce
maria
young
to
waive
the
ceremony
of
being
first
invited
by
the
real
housekeepers
and
to
spend
as
much
time
as
she
could
with
her
friend
give
my
kind
regards
to
maria
said
the
letter
and
tell
her
i
like
to
fancy
you
two
passing
a
long
evening
by
that
fireside
where
we
all
hope
we
shall
often
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
six
months
ago
hester
would
not
have
spoken
so
freely
and
so
kindly
of
maria
she
would
not
have
so
sanctioned
margaret
intimacy
with
her
all
was
right
and
margaret
was
happy
maria
came
and
thanks
to
the
holiday
spirit
of
a
wedding
week
for
a
long
day
delicious
are
the
pleasures
of
those
whose
appetite
for
them
is
whetted
by
abstinence
charming
wholly
charming
was
this
day
to
maria
spent
in
quiet
free
from
the
children
free
from
the
observation
of
other
guests
passed
in
all
external
luxury
and
in
confidence
with
the
friend
to
whom
she
had
owed
some
of
the
best
pleasures
of
the
last
year
margaret
was
no
less
happy
in
indulging
her
and
in
opening
much
more
of
her
heart
to
her
than
she
could
to
any
one
else
since
hester
married
which
now
at
the
end
of
six
days
seemed
a
long
time
ago
miss
young
came
early
that
she
might
see
the
house
and
everything
in
it
before
dark
and
the
days
were
now
at
their
shortest
she
did
not
mind
the
fatigue
of
mounting
to
the
very
top
of
the
house
she
must
see
the
view
from
the
window
of
morris
attic
yesterday
fall
of
snow
had
made
the
meadows
one
sheet
of
white
and
the
river
looked
black
and
the
woods
somewhat
frowning
and
dismal
but
those
who
knew
the
place
so
well
could
imagine
what
all
this
must
be
in
summer
and
morris
was
assured
that
her
room
was
the
pleasantest
in
the
house
morris
curtseyed
and
smiled
and
did
not
say
how
cold
and
dreary
a
wide
landscape
appeared
to
her
and
how
much
better
she
should
have
liked
to
look
out
upon
a
street
if
only
mr
hope
had
happened
to
have
been
settled
in
birmingham
she
pointed
out
to
maria
how
good
miss
hester
had
been
in
thinking
about
the
furnishing
of
this
attic
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
have
the
pictures
of
morris
father
and
mother
which
had
always
hung
opposite
her
bed
at
birmingham
brought
hither
and
fixed
up
in
the
same
place
the
had
come
too
so
that
except
for
its
being
so
much
lighter
and
the
prospect
from
the
window
so
different
it
was
almost
like
the
same
room
she
had
slept
in
for
years
before
when
maria
looked
at
the
pictures
silhouettes
taken
from
shadows
on
the
wall
with
numerous
little
deformities
and
disproportions
incident
to
that
method
of
taking
likenesses
she
appreciated
hester
thoughtfulness
though
she
fully
agreed
in
what
margaret
said
that
if
morris
was
willing
to
leave
a
place
where
she
had
lived
so
many
years
for
the
sake
of
remaining
with
hester
and
her
it
was
the
least
they
could
do
to
make
her
feel
as
much
at
home
as
possible
in
her
new
abode
margaret
own
chamber
was
one
of
the
prettiest
rooms
in
the
house
with
its
light
green
paper
its
french
bed
and
toilet
at
one
end
and
the
table
and
footstool
and
armchair
at
the
other
i
shall
spend
many
hours
alone
here
in
the
bright
summer
mornings
said
margaret
here
i
shall
write
my
letters
and
study
and
think
and
nod
over
your
books
perhaps
said
maria
these
seem
comfortable
arrangements
for
an
old
or
infirm
person
but
i
should
be
afraid
they
would
send
you
to
sleep
you
have
had
little
experience
of
being
alone
do
you
know
the
strong
tendency
that
solitary
people
have
to
napping
margaret
laughed
she
had
never
slept
in
the
daytime
in
her
life
except
in
illness
she
could
not
conceive
of
it
in
the
case
of
a
young
person
full
of
occupation
with
a
hundred
things
to
think
about
and
twenty
books
at
a
time
that
she
wanted
to
read
she
thought
that
regular
daily
solitude
must
be
the
most
delightful
the
most
improving
thing
in
the
world
she
had
always
envied
the
privilege
of
people
who
could
command
solitude
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
going
to
enjoy
it
and
try
to
profit
by
it
you
began
yesterday
i
think
said
maria
how
did
you
like
it
it
was
no
fair
trial
i
felt
restless
at
having
the
house
in
my
charge
and
i
was
thinking
of
hester
perpetually
and
then
i
did
not
know
but
that
some
of
the
greys
might
come
in
at
any
moment
and
besides
i
was
so
busy
considering
whether
i
was
making
the
most
of
the
precious
hours
that
i
really
did
next
to
nothing
all
day
but
you
looked
sadly
tired
at
night
miss
margaret
said
morris
i
never
saw
you
more
fit
for
bed
after
any
party
or
ball
maria
smiled
she
knew
something
of
the
fatigues
as
well
as
the
pleasures
of
solitude
margaret
smiled
too
but
she
said
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
when
the
family
were
settled
and
when
it
should
have
become
a
habit
to
spend
the
morning
hours
alone
and
to
this
maria
fully
agreed
morris
thought
that
people
liking
or
not
liking
to
be
alone
depended
much
on
their
having
easy
or
irksome
thoughts
in
their
minds
margaret
answered
gaily
that
in
that
case
she
was
pretty
sure
of
liking
solitude
she
was
made
grave
by
a
sigh
and
a
shake
of
the
head
from
morris
morris
what
do
you
mean
said
margaret
apprehensively
why
do
you
sigh
and
shake
your
head
why
should
not
i
have
easy
thoughts
as
often
as
i
sit
in
that
chair
we
never
know
miss
margaret
my
dear
how
things
will
turn
out
do
you
remember
miss
stevenson
that
married
a
gentleman
her
family
all
thought
a
great
deal
of
and
he
turned
out
a
swindler
and
the
girls
burst
out
and
maria
assured
morris
that
she
could
answer
for
no
accident
of
that
kind
happening
with
regard
to
mr
hope
morris
laughed
too
and
said
she
did
not
mean
that
but
only
that
she
never
saw
anybody
more
confident
of
everything
going
right
than
miss
stevenson
and
all
her
family
and
within
a
month
after
the
wedding
they
were
in
the
deepest
distress
that
was
what
she
meant
but
there
were
many
other
ways
of
distress
happening
there
is
death
my
dears
she
said
remember
death
miss
margaret
indeed
morris
i
do
said
margaret
i
never
thought
so
much
of
death
as
i
have
done
since
mr
hope
accident
when
i
believed
death
was
coming
to
make
us
all
miserable
and
the
more
i
have
since
recoiled
from
it
the
oftener
has
the
thought
come
back
that
is
all
right
my
dear
all
very
natural
it
does
not
seem
natural
to
undertake
any
great
new
thing
in
life
without
reminding
one
self
of
the
end
that
must
come
to
all
our
doings
however
i
trust
my
master
and
mistress
and
you
have
many
a
happy
year
to
live
i
like
those
words
morris
i
like
to
hear
you
speak
of
your
master
and
mistress
it
has
such
a
domestic
sound
does
it
not
make
one
feel
at
home
maria
yes
morris
there
i
shall
sit
and
feel
so
at
ease
so
at
home
once
more
but
there
may
be
other
morris
stopped
and
changed
her
mood
she
stepped
to
the
closet
and
opened
the
door
to
show
miss
young
the
provision
of
shelves
and
pegs
and
pointed
out
the
part
of
the
room
where
she
had
hoped
there
would
be
a
sofa
she
should
have
liked
that
miss
margaret
should
have
had
a
sofa
to
lie
down
on
when
she
pleased
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
thing
wanting
margaret
gaily
declared
that
nothing
was
wanting
she
had
never
seen
a
room
more
entirely
to
her
taste
though
she
had
inhabited
some
that
were
grander
by
the
time
the
little
had
been
duly
visited
and
it
had
been
explained
that
the
other
small
parlour
must
necessarily
be
kept
for
a
for
mr
hope
patients
and
the
young
ladies
had
returned
to
the
maria
was
in
full
flow
of
sympathy
with
the
housekeeping
interests
and
ideas
which
occupied
or
rather
amused
her
companion
women
do
inevitably
love
housekeeping
unless
educational
or
other
impediments
interfere
with
their
natural
tastes
household
management
is
to
them
the
object
of
their
talents
the
subject
of
their
interests
the
vehicle
of
their
hopes
and
fears
the
medium
through
which
their
affections
are
manifested
and
much
of
their
benevolence
gratified
if
it
be
true
as
has
been
said
that
there
is
no
good
quality
of
a
woman
heart
and
mind
which
is
not
necessary
to
perfect
housekeeping
it
follows
that
there
is
no
power
of
the
mind
or
affection
of
the
heart
which
may
not
be
gratified
in
the
course
of
its
discharge
as
margaret
and
her
guest
enjoyed
their
pheasant
their
table
drawn
close
to
the
sofa
and
the
fire
that
maria
might
be
saved
the
trouble
of
moving
their
talk
was
of
tradespeople
of
shopping
at
deerbrook
and
the
market
at
birmingham
of
the
kitchen
and
and
the
winter
and
summer
arrangements
of
the
table
the
whom
margaret
was
teaching
to
wait
often
forgot
his
function
and
stood
still
to
listen
and
at
last
left
the
room
deeply
impressed
with
the
wisdom
of
his
instructor
and
her
guest
when
the
dinner
and
the
wine
were
gone
they
sang
they
gossiped
they
quizzed
the
greys
were
sacred
of
course
but
many
an
anecdote
came
out
told
honestly
and
with
of
dear
old
mrs
enderby
and
her
talent
for
being
pleased
of
mrs
rowland
transactions
abroad
and
at
home
all
regulated
by
the
principle
of
eclipsing
the
greys
and
of
mrs
howell
and
miss
fine
sentiments
and
extraordinary
pieces
of
news
margaret
produced
some
of
her
outlines
which
she
had
picked
up
and
preserved
sketches
of
the
children
in
the
oddest
attitudes
of
children
of
dr
levitt
resting
his
book
on
the
end
of
his
nose
as
he
read
in
his
of
mrs
plumstead
exasperated
by
the
arrival
of
an
illegible
letter
of
almost
every
oddity
in
the
place
then
out
came
the
pencils
and
the
girls
supplied
omissions
they
sketched
mr
hope
himself
listening
to
an
old
woman
theory
of
her
own
case
they
sketched
each
other
mr
enderby
was
almost
the
only
person
omitted
altogether
in
conversation
and
on
paper
where
can
i
have
hidden
my
work
bag
asked
maria
after
tea
you
laid
it
beside
you
and
i
put
it
away
said
margaret
i
wanted
to
see
whether
you
could
spend
a
whole
afternoon
without
the
feel
of
your
thimble
you
shall
have
it
again
now
for
you
never
once
asked
for
it
between
dinner
and
tea
i
forgot
it
but
now
you
must
give
it
me
i
must
finish
my
collar
or
i
shall
not
duly
honour
your
sister
in
my
first
call
we
can
talk
as
well
working
as
idle
can
not
i
help
you
our
affairs
are
all
in
such
dreadfully
perfect
order
that
i
have
not
a
stitch
of
work
to
do
i
see
a
hole
in
your
glove
let
me
mend
it
do
and
when
you
have
done
that
there
is
the
other
two
years
hence
how
you
will
wonder
that
there
ever
was
a
time
when
you
had
not
a
stitch
of
work
in
the
house
wedding
clothes
last
about
two
years
and
then
they
all
wear
out
together
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
work
you
will
have
to
do
then
if
nothing
should
come
between
you
and
it
what
should
come
between
us
and
it
said
margaret
struck
by
the
tone
in
which
maria
spoke
the
last
words
are
you
following
morris
lead
are
you
going
to
say
death
miss
margaret
oh
no
but
there
are
other
things
which
happen
sometimes
besides
death
i
beg
your
pardon
margaret
if
i
am
impertinent
how
should
you
be
impertinent
you
the
most
intimate
friend
but
one
that
i
have
in
the
world
you
mean
marriage
of
course
that
i
may
marry
within
these
same
two
years
any
one
may
naturally
say
so
i
suppose
to
a
girl
whose
sister
is
just
married
and
in
another
person
case
it
would
seem
to
me
probable
enough
but
i
assure
you
maria
i
do
not
feel
as
if
it
was
at
all
likely
that
i
should
marry
i
quite
believe
you
margaret
i
have
no
doubt
you
feel
so
and
that
you
will
feel
so
till
but
dear
you
may
one
day
find
yourself
feeling
very
differently
without
a
moment
warning
and
that
day
may
happen
within
two
years
such
things
have
been
known
if
there
was
any
one
said
margaret
simply
if
i
had
ever
seen
any
one
for
whom
i
could
fancy
myself
feeling
as
hester
did
if
there
was
any
one
repeated
maria
looking
up
in
some
surprise
my
dear
margaret
do
you
mean
to
say
there
is
no
one
yes
i
do
i
think
so
i
know
what
you
mean
maria
i
understand
your
face
and
your
voice
but
i
do
think
it
is
very
hard
that
one
can
not
enjoy
a
pleasant
friendship
with
anybody
without
seeing
people
on
the
watch
for
something
more
it
is
so
very
painful
to
have
such
ideas
put
into
one
mind
to
spoil
all
one
intercourse
to
throw
restraint
over
it
to
mix
up
selfishness
with
it
it
is
so
wrong
to
interfere
between
those
who
might
and
would
be
the
most
useful
and
delightful
companions
to
each
other
without
having
a
thought
which
need
put
constraint
between
them
those
who
so
interfere
have
a
great
deal
to
answer
for
they
do
not
know
what
mischief
they
may
be
doing
what
pain
they
may
be
giving
while
they
are
gossiping
and
making
remarks
to
one
another
about
what
they
know
nothing
at
all
about
i
have
no
patience
with
such
meddling
so
i
perceive
indeed
replied
maria
somewhat
amused
but
margaret
you
have
been
enlarging
a
good
deal
on
what
i
said
not
a
syllable
was
spoken
about
any
remarks
any
observations
between
any
people
or
even
about
reference
to
any
particular
person
i
alone
must
be
subject
to
all
this
displeasure
and
even
i
did
not
throw
out
a
single
hint
about
any
friend
of
yours
no
you
did
not
that
is
all
very
true
said
margaret
blushing
but
neither
was
i
vexed
with
you
at
least
not
so
much
as
with
some
others
i
was
hasty
you
were
indeed
said
maria
laughing
i
never
witnessed
such
an
outburst
from
you
before
and
you
shall
not
see
such
another
but
i
was
answering
less
what
you
said
than
what
i
have
reason
to
suppose
is
in
the
minds
of
several
other
people
in
their
minds
they
have
not
told
you
their
thoughts
then
and
other
people
too
why
margaret
i
really
think
it
is
not
very
reasonable
in
you
to
find
fault
with
others
for
thinking
something
which
they
have
not
troubled
you
to
listen
to
and
which
is
so
natural
that
it
has
struck
of
them
surely
margaret
you
must
be
a
little
just
a
very
little
touchy
upon
the
matter
touchy
what
should
make
me
touchy
ay
what
i
do
assure
you
maria
nothing
whatever
has
passed
between
that
person
and
me
which
has
anything
more
than
the
commonest
no
i
will
not
say
the
commonest
friendship
because
i
believe
ours
is
a
very
warm
and
intimate
friendship
but
indeed
it
is
nothing
more
you
may
be
sure
that
if
it
had
been
otherwise
i
should
not
have
said
a
word
upon
the
whole
matter
even
to
you
and
i
would
not
have
allowed
even
you
to
speak
ten
words
to
me
about
it
are
you
satisfied
now
i
am
satisfied
that
you
any
what
you
think
oh
maria
what
a
sigh
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
sigh
i
was
thinking
of
course
of
true
love
but
not
that
it
does
run
smooth
that
is
not
true
witness
hester
dear
margaret
be
not
presumptuous
consider
how
early
the
days
of
that
love
are
yet
and
that
love
in
their
case
has
only
just
leaped
out
of
the
fountain
and
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
begun
its
course
well
may
heaven
smile
on
it
but
tell
me
about
that
course
of
love
which
made
you
sigh
as
you
did
just
now
what
can
i
tell
you
about
it
and
yet
you
shall
know
if
you
like
how
it
appears
to
me
oh
tell
me
i
shall
see
whether
you
would
have
understood
case
the
first
strange
thing
is
that
every
woman
approaches
this
crisis
of
her
life
as
unawares
as
if
she
were
the
first
that
ever
loved
and
yet
all
girls
are
brought
up
to
think
of
marriage
as
almost
the
only
event
in
life
their
minds
are
stuffed
with
thoughts
of
it
almost
before
they
have
had
time
to
gain
any
other
ideas
merely
as
means
to
ends
low
enough
for
their
comprehension
it
is
not
marriage
wonderful
holy
mysterious
marriage
that
their
minds
are
full
of
but
connection
with
somebody
or
something
which
will
give
them
money
and
ease
and
station
and
independence
of
their
parents
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
love
i
was
speaking
of
love
the
grand
influence
of
a
woman
life
but
whose
name
is
a
mere
empty
sound
to
her
till
it
becomes
suddenly
secretly
a
voice
which
shakes
her
being
to
the
very
centre
more
awful
more
tremendous
than
the
crack
of
doom
but
why
why
so
tremendous
from
the
struggle
which
it
calls
upon
her
to
endure
silently
and
alone
from
the
agony
of
a
change
of
existence
which
must
be
wrought
without
any
eye
perceiving
it
depend
upon
it
margaret
there
is
nothing
in
death
to
compare
with
this
change
and
there
can
be
nothing
in
entrance
upon
another
state
which
can
transcend
the
experience
i
speak
of
our
powers
can
but
be
taxed
to
the
utmost
our
being
can
but
be
strained
till
not
another
effort
can
be
made
this
is
all
that
we
can
conceive
to
happen
in
death
and
it
happens
in
love
with
the
additional
burden
of
fearful
secrecy
one
may
lie
down
and
await
death
with
sympathy
about
one
to
the
last
though
the
passage
hence
must
be
solitary
and
it
would
be
a
small
trouble
if
all
the
world
looked
on
to
see
the
parting
of
soul
and
body
but
that
other
passage
into
a
new
state
that
other
process
of
becoming
a
new
creature
must
go
on
in
the
darkness
of
the
spirit
while
the
body
is
up
and
abroad
and
no
one
must
know
what
is
passing
within
the
spirit
leap
from
heaven
to
hell
must
be
made
while
the
smile
is
on
the
lips
and
light
words
are
upon
the
tongue
the
struggles
of
shame
the
pangs
of
despair
must
be
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
every
groan
must
be
stifled
before
it
is
heard
and
as
for
tears
they
are
a
solace
too
gentle
for
the
case
the
agony
is
too
strong
for
tears
is
this
true
love
asked
margaret
in
agitation
this
is
true
love
but
not
the
whole
of
it
as
for
what
follows
but
is
this
what
every
woman
has
to
undergo
do
you
suppose
that
every
woman
knows
what
love
really
is
no
not
even
every
unmarried
woman
there
are
some
among
them
though
i
believe
but
few
who
know
nothing
of
what
love
is
and
there
are
undoubtedly
a
multitude
of
wives
who
have
experienced
liking
preference
affection
and
taken
it
for
love
and
who
reach
their
life
end
without
being
aware
that
they
have
never
loved
there
are
also
i
trust
a
multitude
of
wives
who
have
really
loved
and
who
have
reaped
the
best
fruits
of
it
in
regeneration
of
soul
but
how
dreadful
is
the
process
if
it
be
as
you
say
i
said
i
had
alluded
to
only
a
part
of
it
as
for
what
follows
according
as
it
is
prosperous
or
unreturned
love
heaven
ensues
upon
this
purgatory
or
one
may
attain
a
middle
region
somewhat
dim
but
serene
you
wish
me
to
be
plainer
i
wish
to
hear
all
you
think
all
you
know
but
do
not
let
us
go
on
with
it
if
it
makes
you
sigh
so
what
woman
ever
spoke
of
love
without
sighing
said
maria
with
a
smile
you
sighed
yourself
just
now
i
was
thinking
of
hester
i
believe
how
strange
if
this
process
really
awaits
women
if
it
is
a
region
through
which
their
path
of
life
must
stretch
and
no
one
gives
warning
or
preparation
or
help
it
is
not
so
strange
as
at
first
sight
it
seems
every
mother
and
friend
hopes
that
no
one
else
has
suffered
as
she
did
that
her
particular
charge
may
escape
entirely
or
get
off
more
easily
then
there
is
the
shame
of
confession
which
is
involved
some
conclude
at
a
distance
of
time
that
they
must
have
exaggerated
their
own
sufferings
or
have
been
singularly
rebellious
and
unreasonable
some
lose
the
sense
of
the
anguish
in
the
subsequent
happiness
and
there
are
not
a
few
who
from
constitution
of
mind
forget
altogether
things
that
are
behind
when
you
remember
too
that
it
is
the
law
of
nature
and
providence
that
each
should
bear
his
and
her
own
burden
and
that
no
warning
would
be
of
any
avail
it
seems
no
longer
so
strange
that
while
girls
hear
endlessly
of
marriage
they
are
kept
wholly
in
the
dark
about
love
would
warning
really
be
of
no
avail
of
no
more
avail
than
warning
to
a
pilgrim
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
that
he
will
suffer
from
thirst
and
be
deluded
by
the
mirage
before
he
gets
into
green
fields
again
he
has
no
longer
the
choice
whether
to
be
a
pilgrim
in
the
desert
or
to
stay
at
home
no
one
of
us
has
the
choice
to
be
or
not
to
be
and
we
must
go
through
with
our
experience
under
its
natural
conditions
be
or
not
to
be
said
margaret
with
a
grave
smile
you
remind
one
that
the
choice
of
suicide
remains
and
i
almost
wonder
surely
suicide
has
been
committed
from
dread
of
lighter
woes
than
you
have
described
i
believe
so
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
dread
we
find
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
before
we
are
aware
and
then
ay
and
then
he
who
appoints
the
struggles
of
the
spirit
supplies
aids
and
supports
i
fully
believe
that
this
time
of
conflict
is
that
in
which
religion
first
becomes
to
many
the
reality
for
which
they
ever
afterwards
live
it
may
have
been
hitherto
a
name
a
fancy
a
dim
abstraction
or
an
intermitting
though
bright
influence
and
it
may
yet
be
resorted
to
merely
as
a
refuge
for
the
spirit
which
can
find
no
other
but
there
is
a
strong
probability
that
it
may
now
be
found
to
be
a
wonderful
reality
not
only
a
potent
charm
in
sorrow
but
the
life
of
our
life
this
is
with
many
the
reason
why
and
the
mode
in
which
the
conflict
is
endured
to
the
end
but
the
beginning
said
margaret
what
can
be
the
beginning
of
this
wonderful
experience
the
same
with
that
of
all
the
most
serious
of
our
experiences
levity
unconsciousness
confidence
upon
what
subject
in
the
world
is
there
a
greater
accumulation
of
jokes
than
upon
love
and
marriage
and
upon
what
subject
are
jokes
so
indefatigably
current
a
girl
laughs
at
her
companions
and
blushes
or
pouts
for
herself
as
girls
have
done
for
thousands
of
years
before
her
she
finds
by
degrees
new
and
sweet
and
elevated
ideas
of
friendship
stealing
their
way
into
her
mind
and
she
laments
and
wonders
that
the
range
of
friendship
is
not
wider
that
its
action
is
not
freer
that
girls
may
not
enjoy
intimate
friendship
with
the
companions
of
their
brothers
as
well
as
with
their
own
there
is
a
quick
and
strong
resentment
at
any
one
who
smiles
at
or
speculates
upon
or
even
observes
the
existence
of
such
a
friendship
oh
maria
exclaimed
margaret
throwing
down
her
work
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
this
goes
on
for
a
while
proceeded
maria
as
if
she
did
not
observe
her
companion
this
goes
on
for
a
while
smoothly
innocently
serenely
mankind
are
then
true
and
noble
the
world
is
passing
fair
and
god
is
tender
and
bountiful
all
evil
is
seen
to
be
tending
to
good
all
tears
are
meant
to
be
wiped
away
the
gloom
of
the
gloomy
is
faithless
virtue
is
easy
and
charming
and
the
vice
of
the
vicious
is
unaccountable
thus
does
young
life
glide
on
for
a
time
then
there
comes
a
day
it
is
often
a
mystery
why
it
should
be
that
day
of
all
days
when
the
innocent
and
gay
and
confident
young
creature
finds
herself
in
sudden
trouble
the
film
on
which
she
lightly
trod
has
burst
and
she
is
in
an
abyss
it
seems
a
mere
trifle
that
plunged
her
there
her
friend
did
not
come
when
she
looked
for
him
or
he
is
gone
somewhere
or
he
has
said
something
that
she
did
not
expect
some
such
trifle
reveals
to
her
that
she
depends
wholly
upon
him
that
she
has
for
long
been
living
only
for
him
and
on
the
unconscious
conclusion
that
he
has
been
living
only
for
her
at
the
image
of
his
dwelling
anywhere
but
by
her
side
of
his
having
any
interest
apart
from
hers
the
universe
is
in
a
moment
shrouded
in
gloom
her
heart
is
sick
and
there
is
no
rest
for
it
for
her
is
gone
she
has
been
reared
in
a
maidenly
pride
and
an
innocent
confidence
her
confidence
is
wholly
her
pride
is
wounded
and
the
agony
of
the
wound
is
intolerable
we
are
wont
to
say
margaret
that
everything
is
endurable
but
a
sense
of
guilt
if
there
be
an
exception
this
is
it
this
wounding
of
the
spirit
ought
not
perhaps
to
be
but
it
is
very
like
the
sting
of
guilt
and
a
spirit
who
can
bear
how
is
it
borne
so
many
as
are
the
sufferers
and
of
a
class
usually
thought
so
weak
that
is
a
mistake
there
is
not
on
earth
a
being
stronger
than
a
woman
in
the
concealment
of
her
love
the
soldier
is
called
brave
who
cheerfully
bears
about
the
pain
of
a
laceration
to
his
dying
day
and
criminals
who
after
years
of
struggle
unbosom
themselves
of
their
secret
give
tremendous
accounts
of
the
sufferings
of
those
years
but
i
question
whether
a
woman
whose
existence
has
been
burdened
with
an
unrequited
love
will
not
have
to
unfold
in
the
next
world
a
more
harrowing
tale
than
either
of
these
it
ought
not
to
be
so
it
ought
not
where
there
is
no
guilt
but
how
noble
is
such
power
of
though
the
principle
of
society
may
be
to
cultivate
our
pride
to
excess
what
fortitude
grows
out
of
it
there
are
no
bounds
to
the
horror
disgust
and
astonishment
expressed
when
a
woman
owns
her
love
to
its
object
unasked
even
urges
it
upon
him
but
i
acknowledge
my
surprise
to
be
the
other
way
that
the
cases
are
so
rare
yet
fancying
the
case
one
own
oh
dreadful
cried
margaret
no
woman
can
endure
the
bare
thought
of
the
case
being
her
own
and
this
proves
the
strong
natural
and
educational
restraint
under
which
we
all
lie
but
i
must
think
that
the
frequent
and
patient
endurance
proves
a
strength
of
soul
a
vigour
of
moral
power
which
ought
to
console
and
animate
us
in
the
depth
of
our
abasement
if
we
could
but
recall
it
then
when
we
want
support
and
solace
most
it
can
be
little
estimated
little
understood
said
margaret
or
it
would
not
be
sported
with
as
it
is
do
not
let
us
speak
of
that
margaret
you
talk
of
my
philosophy
sometimes
i
own
that
that
part
of
the
subject
is
too
much
for
any
philosophy
i
have
i
see
nothing
philosophical
said
margaret
in
making
light
of
the
deepest
cruelty
and
treachery
which
is
transacted
under
the
sun
a
man
who
trifles
with
such
affections
and
abuses
such
moral
power
and
calls
his
cruelty
flirtation
is
such
an
one
as
we
will
not
speak
of
now
well
it
can
not
be
but
that
good
moral
and
intellectual
good
must
issue
from
such
exercise
and
discipline
as
this
and
such
good
does
issue
often
perhaps
generally
there
are
sad
tales
sung
and
told
everywhere
of
brains
crazed
and
graves
dug
by
hopeless
love
and
i
fear
that
many
more
sink
down
into
disease
and
death
from
this
cause
than
are
at
all
suspected
to
be
its
victims
but
not
a
few
find
themselves
lifted
up
from
their
abyss
and
set
free
from
their
bondage
of
pride
and
humiliation
they
marry
their
loves
and
stand
amazed
at
their
own
bliss
and
are
truly
the
happiest
people
upon
earth
and
in
the
broad
road
to
be
the
wisest
in
my
belief
the
happiest
are
ever
so
bless
you
for
that
for
hester
sake
and
what
of
those
who
are
not
thus
released
they
get
out
of
the
abyss
too
but
they
have
to
struggle
out
alone
their
condition
must
depend
much
on
what
they
were
before
the
conflict
befell
them
some
are
soured
and
live
restlessly
some
are
weak
and
come
out
worldly
and
sacrifice
themselves
in
marriage
or
otherwise
for
low
objects
some
strive
to
forget
and
to
become
as
like
as
possible
to
what
they
were
before
and
of
this
order
are
many
of
the
women
whom
we
meet
whose
minds
are
in
a
state
of
perpetual
and
incurable
infancy
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
purpose
of
their
suffering
from
any
effects
it
appears
to
have
produced
but
then
there
is
the
hope
that
their
griefs
were
not
of
the
deepest
and
what
of
those
whose
griefs
are
of
the
deepest
they
rise
the
highest
above
them
some
of
these
must
be
content
with
having
learned
more
or
less
of
what
life
is
and
of
what
it
is
for
and
with
reconciling
themselves
to
its
objects
and
conditions
in
short
with
being
philosophical
said
margaret
with
an
inquiring
and
affectionate
glance
at
her
friend
with
being
philosophical
maria
smilingly
agreed
others
of
a
happier
nature
to
whom
philosophy
and
religion
come
as
one
and
are
welcomed
by
energies
not
wholly
destroyed
and
affections
not
altogether
crushed
are
strong
in
the
new
strength
which
they
have
found
with
hearts
as
wide
as
the
universe
and
spirits
the
gayest
of
the
gay
you
never
told
me
anything
of
all
this
before
said
margaret
yet
it
is
plain
that
you
must
have
thought
much
about
it
that
it
must
have
been
long
in
your
mind
it
has
and
i
tell
it
to
you
that
you
may
share
what
i
have
learned
instead
of
going
without
the
knowledge
or
alas
gathering
it
up
for
yourself
oh
then
it
is
so
it
is
from
your
own
it
is
from
my
own
experience
that
i
speak
said
maria
without
looking
up
and
now
there
is
some
one
in
the
world
who
knows
it
beside
myself
i
hope
you
do
not
i
hope
you
never
will
repent
having
told
me
said
margaret
rising
and
taking
her
seat
on
the
sofa
beside
her
friend
i
do
not
and
i
shall
not
repent
said
maria
you
are
faithful
and
it
will
be
a
relief
to
me
to
have
sympathy
to
be
able
to
speak
sometimes
instead
of
having
to
deny
and
repress
my
whole
heart
and
soul
but
i
can
tell
you
no
more
not
one
word
do
not
only
show
me
how
i
can
comfort
how
i
can
gratify
you
i
need
no
special
comfort
now
said
maria
smiling
i
sometimes
grievously
wanted
a
friend
to
love
and
speak
with
and
if
i
could
to
serve
now
i
have
a
friend
and
the
look
with
which
she
gazed
at
her
companion
brought
the
tears
into
margaret
eyes
come
let
us
speak
of
something
else
said
maria
cheerfully
when
do
you
expect
your
friend
mr
enderby
at
deerbrook
again
his
sister
says
nobody
knows
and
i
do
not
think
he
can
tell
himself
you
know
he
does
not
live
at
deerbrook
i
am
aware
of
that
but
his
last
visit
was
such
a
long
one
six
days
said
margaret
laughing
ah
i
did
not
mean
his
last
week
appearance
or
any
of
his
pop
visits
i
was
thinking
of
his
summer
visitation
it
was
so
long
that
some
people
began
to
look
upon
him
as
a
resident
if
his
mother
does
not
grow
much
better
soon
we
shall
see
him
again
said
margaret
it
is
always
her
illness
that
brings
do
you
not
believe
me
maria
i
believe
as
before
that
you
say
what
you
think
whether
you
are
mistaken
is
another
question
which
i
can
not
pretend
to
answer
i
hope
maria
that
as
you
have
placed
so
much
confidence
in
me
you
will
not
stop
short
at
the
very
point
which
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
me
i
will
not
dear
what
i
think
on
the
subject
of
mr
enderby
in
relation
to
you
is
that
some
of
your
friends
believe
that
you
are
the
cause
of
his
stay
having
been
so
long
in
the
summer
and
of
his
coming
so
often
since
i
know
no
more
than
this
how
should
i
then
i
will
tell
you
something
more
that
i
might
as
well
have
mentioned
before
when
mrs
rowland
had
an
idea
that
mr
enderby
might
think
of
hester
she
told
hester
that
miserable
day
in
dingleford
woods
that
his
family
expected
he
would
soon
marry
a
young
lady
of
family
and
fortune
who
was
a
great
favourite
with
all
his
connections
who
may
this
young
lady
be
oh
she
did
not
say
some
one
too
high
for
our
acquaintance
if
we
are
to
believe
what
mrs
rowland
declared
and
do
you
believe
it
why
do
you
i
dare
say
mrs
rowland
may
believe
it
herself
but
she
may
be
mistaken
that
is
exactly
what
hester
said
observed
margaret
eagerly
and
that
was
more
than
five
months
ago
and
we
have
not
heard
a
syllable
of
the
matter
since
and
so
intimate
a
friendship
as
yours
and
mr
enderby
is
said
maria
smiling
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
his
mind
should
be
full
of
such
an
affair
and
that
he
should
be
able
to
conceal
it
so
perfectly
from
you
i
am
glad
you
think
so
said
margaret
ingenuously
you
can
not
imagine
how
strange
it
is
to
see
mrs
grey
and
others
taking
for
granted
that
he
is
free
when
hester
and
i
could
tell
them
in
a
moment
what
mrs
rowland
said
but
if
you
think
mrs
rowland
is
all
wrong
what
do
you
really
suppose
about
his
coming
so
much
to
deerbrook
i
have
little
doubt
that
those
friends
of
yours
mrs
grey
and
the
others
are
right
but
but
what
just
this
if
i
might
warn
you
by
myself
i
would
caution
you
not
only
against
dwelling
much
upon
such
a
fact
but
against
interpreting
it
to
mean
more
than
it
possibly
may
this
is
my
reason
for
speaking
to
you
upon
the
matter
at
all
i
do
it
because
you
will
be
pretty
sure
to
hear
how
the
fact
itself
is
viewed
by
others
while
no
one
else
would
be
likely
to
give
you
the
caution
mr
enderby
come
as
you
suppose
entirely
to
see
his
mother
he
may
come
to
see
you
but
supposing
he
does
if
he
is
like
other
men
he
may
not
know
his
own
mind
yet
and
there
is
another
possible
thing
a
thing
which
is
possible
margaret
though
he
is
such
a
dear
and
intimate
friend
that
he
may
not
know
yours
all
its
strength
of
affection
all
its
fidelity
all
its
trust
and
power
of
oh
stop
pray
stop
said
margaret
you
frighten
me
with
the
thoughts
of
all
you
have
been
saying
this
evening
though
i
could
so
entirely
satisfy
you
as
to
what
our
intercourse
has
been
though
i
know
mr
enderby
so
much
better
than
you
do
you
need
warn
me
no
more
i
will
think
of
what
you
have
said
if
i
find
myself
doubting
whether
he
comes
to
see
his
mother
if
i
find
myself
listening
to
what
others
may
suppose
about
his
reasons
indeed
i
will
remember
what
you
have
said
then
i
am
glad
i
ventured
to
say
it
particularly
as
you
are
not
angry
with
me
this
time
i
am
not
at
all
angry
how
could
i
be
so
but
i
do
not
agree
with
you
about
the
fact
i
know
it
and
i
may
be
mistaken
now
tell
me
said
margaret
what
you
suppose
morris
meant
when
she
said
what
you
heard
about
the
pleasure
of
solitude
depending
on
thoughts
being
happy
or
otherwise
i
know
it
is
a
common
old
idea
enough
but
morris
does
not
know
that
and
i
am
sure
she
had
some
particular
instance
in
view
morris
does
not
make
general
propositions
except
with
a
particular
case
in
her
mind
eye
and
she
is
a
wise
woman
and
we
think
her
sayings
are
weighty
it
struck
me
that
she
had
a
real
probability
in
her
mind
but
i
did
not
think
it
related
to
mr
enderby
or
to
anything
so
exclusively
your
own
concern
no
i
hope
not
but
what
then
i
think
that
morris
knows
more
of
life
and
the
world
than
you
and
that
she
does
not
anticipate
quite
so
much
happiness
from
hester
marriage
as
you
do
do
not
be
distressed
or
alarmed
she
means
no
mistrust
of
anybody
i
imagine
but
only
that
there
is
no
perfect
happiness
in
this
life
that
nobody
is
faultless
and
no
home
not
even
where
her
young
ladies
live
is
quite
free
from
care
and
trouble
it
would
not
hurt
you
surely
if
she
was
to
say
this
outright
to
you
oh
no
nor
a
good
deal
more
of
the
same
tendency
she
might
come
much
nearer
to
the
point
good
soul
without
hurting
me
suppose
i
ask
her
what
it
was
she
did
mean
or
when
she
and
i
are
alone
well
if
she
is
such
a
wise
woman
but
i
doubt
whether
you
could
get
her
nearer
to
the
point
without
danger
of
hurting
her
can
she
bring
herself
to
own
that
either
of
you
have
faults
oh
yes
she
has
never
spared
us
from
the
time
we
were
two
feet
high
what
can
make
you
so
anxious
as
to
what
she
meant
i
really
hardly
know
unless
it
be
that
where
one
loves
very
much
one
fears
oh
so
faithlessly
i
know
i
ought
to
fear
less
for
hester
than
ever
and
yet
the
door
burst
open
and
the
entered
with
his
jingling
tray
and
news
that
the
sedan
for
miss
young
was
at
the
door
what
sedan
margaret
had
asked
mrs
grey
for
hers
as
the
snow
had
fallen
heavily
and
the
streets
were
not
fit
for
maria
walking
maria
was
very
thankful
here
was
an
end
of
maria
bright
holiday
mr
grey
porters
must
not
be
kept
waiting
the
friends
assured
each
other
that
they
should
never
forget
this
day
it
was
little
likely
that
they
should
chapter
sixteen
home
margaret
had
an
unconscious
expectation
of
seeing
her
sister
altered
this
is
an
irresistible
persuasion
in
almost
every
case
where
an
intimate
friend
is
absent
and
is
under
new
influences
and
amidst
new
circumstances
these
accessories
alter
the
image
of
the
beloved
one
in
our
minds
our
fancy
follows
it
acting
and
being
acted
upon
in
ways
in
which
we
have
no
share
our
sympathy
is
at
fault
or
we
conceive
it
to
be
so
and
doubt
and
trouble
creep
over
us
we
scarcely
know
why
though
the
letters
which
come
may
be
natural
and
hearty
as
of
old
breathing
the
very
spirit
of
our
friend
we
feel
a
sort
of
surprise
at
the
handwriting
being
quite
familiar
we
look
forward
with
a
kind
of
timidity
to
meeting
and
fear
there
may
be
some
restraint
in
it
when
the
hour
of
meeting
comes
there
is
the
very
same
face
the
line
of
the
cheek
the
trick
of
the
lip
the
glance
of
the
eye
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
voice
are
the
same
and
the
intense
familiarity
makes
our
very
spirit
swim
in
joy
we
are
amazed
at
our
previous
fancy
we
laugh
at
the
solemn
stiffness
in
which
our
friend
stood
before
our
mind
eye
and
to
relieve
which
we
had
striven
to
recall
the
ludicrous
situations
and
merry
moods
in
which
that
form
and
that
face
had
been
seen
and
perhaps
we
have
no
peace
till
we
have
acknowledged
to
the
beloved
one
the
ingenuity
of
our
is
there
a
girl
whose
heart
is
with
her
brother
at
college
who
does
not
feel
this
regularly
as
the
vacation
comes
round
is
there
a
parent
whose
child
is
reaping
honours
in
the
field
of
life
and
returning
childlike
from
time
to
time
to
rest
in
the
old
is
there
such
a
parent
who
is
not
conscious
of
the
misgiving
and
the
as
often
as
the
absence
and
the
occur
is
there
even
the
most
trustful
of
wives
whose
husband
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
that
is
wholly
undisturbed
by
the
transmutation
of
the
idol
in
her
mind
when
the
husband
is
returning
and
her
hungry
heart
is
feasting
on
the
anticipation
of
his
appearance
she
may
revel
in
the
thought
and
will
i
see
his
face
again
and
will
i
hear
him
speak
but
it
is
not
till
that
vivid
face
and
that
piercing
voice
thrill
her
sight
and
her
ear
again
that
all
misgiving
vanishes
there
is
nothing
in
life
that
can
compensate
for
long
partings
there
ought
to
be
few
or
no
insurmountable
obstacles
to
the
frequent
meetings
however
short
of
those
who
love
each
other
no
duties
and
no
privileges
can
be
of
more
importance
than
the
preservation
in
all
their
entireness
of
domestic
familiarity
and
faith
a
very
short
separation
will
afford
the
experience
of
a
long
one
if
it
be
full
of
events
or
if
the
image
of
the
absent
one
be
dwelt
upon
from
hour
to
hour
with
laborious
strivings
of
the
fancy
it
has
been
said
that
this
week
of
hester
absence
was
the
longest
that
margaret
had
ever
known
besides
this
she
felt
that
she
had
forgotten
her
sister
further
than
she
could
have
supposed
possible
after
a
ten
separation
on
the
evening
when
she
was
expecting
the
travellers
home
her
heart
was
sick
with
expectation
and
yet
she
was
conscious
of
a
timidity
which
made
her
feel
as
if
alone
in
the
world
again
and
again
she
looked
round
her
to
fancy
what
would
be
the
aspect
of
everything
to
hester
eye
she
wandered
about
the
house
to
see
once
more
that
all
was
in
its
right
place
and
every
arrangement
in
due
order
she
watched
the
bright
fire
nervously
and
made
herself
anxious
about
the
and
sat
upright
on
the
sofa
listening
for
the
sound
of
horses
feet
in
the
snowy
street
as
if
it
had
been
a
solemn
stranger
that
she
was
expecting
instead
of
her
own
sister
hester
with
whom
she
had
shared
all
her
heart
and
spent
all
her
days
but
a
small
part
of
this
anxiety
was
given
to
mr
hope
she
retained
her
image
of
him
unperplexed
as
a
treasure
of
a
brother
and
a
man
with
a
mind
so
healthy
that
he
was
sure
to
receive
all
things
rightly
and
be
pleased
and
satisfied
happen
what
might
they
came
and
hester
spring
from
the
carriage
and
her
husband
way
of
rubbing
his
hands
over
the
fire
put
all
margaret
anxieties
to
flight
how
sweet
was
the
welcome
how
delicious
the
contest
about
which
was
to
give
the
welcome
to
this
the
lasting
home
of
the
three
whether
she
who
had
put
all
in
order
for
them
or
they
who
claimed
to
have
the
charge
of
her
margaret
eyes
overflowed
when
hester
led
her
to
edward
for
his
brotherly
kiss
mr
hope
mind
was
disturbed
for
one
single
moment
that
he
had
not
given
this
kiss
with
all
the
heartiness
and
simplicity
of
a
brother
but
the
feeling
was
gone
almost
before
he
was
conscious
of
it
the
fire
crackled
the
kettle
sang
hester
took
her
own
place
at
once
at
the
and
her
husband
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
after
ascertaining
that
there
were
no
family
letters
for
him
he
knew
that
it
was
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
in
answer
to
the
announcement
of
his
marriage
even
anne
could
not
arrive
these
four
or
five
days
yet
he
desired
margaret
not
to
tell
him
at
present
if
there
were
any
messages
for
him
for
if
all
deerbrook
had
colds
he
had
no
inclination
to
go
out
to
cure
them
there
was
a
long
list
of
messages
margaret
said
but
they
were
in
the
surgery
and
the
pupil
there
might
bring
them
in
if
he
thought
proper
they
should
not
be
sent
for
this
one
evening
might
be
stolen
for
home
and
comfort
their
journey
had
been
delightful
oxford
was
more
splendid
than
hester
had
had
an
idea
of
every
facility
had
been
afforded
them
for
seeing
it
and
mr
acquaintances
there
had
been
as
kind
as
possible
the
fall
of
snow
had
not
put
them
in
any
danger
and
the
inconveniences
it
had
caused
were
rather
stimulating
to
people
who
had
travelled
but
little
hester
had
had
to
get
out
of
the
carriage
twice
and
once
she
had
walked
a
mile
when
the
driver
had
been
uncertain
about
the
road
but
as
mrs
grey
had
had
the
foresight
to
cause
a
pair
of
snow
boots
to
be
put
into
the
carriage
at
the
last
moment
no
harm
had
happened
not
even
to
the
wetting
of
feet
only
enough
inconvenience
to
make
them
glad
to
be
now
by
their
snug
fireside
hester
was
full
of
mirth
and
anecdote
she
seemed
to
have
been
pleased
with
everybody
and
awake
to
everything
as
her
sister
looked
upon
her
brow
now
open
as
a
sleeping
child
upon
the
thick
curl
of
glossy
brown
hair
and
upon
the
bright
smile
which
lighted
up
her
exquisite
face
she
was
amazed
at
herself
for
having
perplexed
such
an
image
with
apprehensive
fancies
how
had
margaret
spent
her
week
above
all
it
was
to
be
hoped
she
had
not
fatigued
herself
in
their
service
there
were
four
days
grace
yet
for
preparation
before
they
should
receive
their
company
margaret
should
not
have
worked
so
hard
had
maria
young
come
yesterday
dear
maria
she
must
often
come
should
not
the
greys
be
asked
to
dine
in
a
quiet
way
before
any
one
else
was
admitted
into
the
house
was
it
not
due
to
them
but
could
the
footboy
wait
at
table
would
it
be
possible
to
bring
him
into
such
training
as
would
prevent
mrs
grey
being
too
much
shocked
at
their
way
of
getting
through
dinner
or
was
there
any
one
in
deerbrook
who
went
out
as
a
waiter
morris
must
be
consulted
but
they
must
have
the
greys
to
dinner
before
monday
how
was
mrs
enderby
was
her
illness
really
thought
serious
or
was
it
only
mrs
rowland
way
of
talking
which
was
just
the
same
whether
mrs
enderby
had
a
twinge
of
rheumatism
or
one
of
her
frightful
attacks
was
mr
enderby
coming
that
was
the
chief
point
if
he
did
not
appear
it
was
certain
that
he
could
not
be
feeling
uneasy
about
his
mother
margaret
blushed
when
she
replied
that
she
had
not
heard
of
mr
enderby
being
expected
she
could
not
but
blush
for
the
conversation
with
maria
came
full
into
her
mind
mr
hope
saw
the
blush
and
painfully
wondered
that
it
sent
trouble
through
his
soul
how
were
morris
and
the
new
maid
likely
to
agree
did
morris
think
the
girl
promising
surely
it
was
time
to
take
some
notice
of
the
servants
edward
would
ring
the
bell
twice
the
signal
for
morris
and
morris
should
introduce
the
other
two
into
the
parlour
they
came
morris
in
her
best
gown
and
with
her
wedding
ribbon
on
when
she
had
shaken
hands
with
her
master
and
mistress
and
spoken
a
good
word
for
her
as
she
called
them
the
girl
appeared
her
cheeks
many
shades
deeper
than
usual
and
her
cap
quillings
standing
off
like
the
rays
on
a
picture
of
the
sun
following
her
came
the
boy
feeling
awkward
in
his
new
clothes
and
scraping
with
his
left
leg
till
the
process
was
put
a
stop
to
by
his
master
entering
into
conversation
with
him
hester
beauty
was
really
so
striking
as
with
a
blushing
bashfulness
she
for
the
first
time
enacted
the
mistress
before
her
husband
eyes
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
observe
it
margaret
glanced
towards
her
brother
and
they
exchanged
smiles
but
the
effect
of
margaret
smile
was
that
mr
hope
died
away
and
left
him
grave
brother
said
margaret
what
is
the
true
story
belonging
to
that
great
book
about
the
polar
sea
that
you
see
lying
there
how
do
you
mean
is
there
any
story
belonging
to
it
at
all
three
at
least
and
deerbrook
has
been
so
hot
about
it
you
should
send
round
the
book
to
cool
them
it
is
enough
to
freeze
one
to
look
at
the
plates
of
those
polar
books
sending
round
the
book
is
exactly
the
thing
i
wanted
to
do
and
could
not
mrs
rowland
insists
that
mrs
enderby
ordered
it
in
and
mrs
grey
demands
to
have
it
first
and
mr
rowland
is
certain
that
you
bespoke
it
before
anybody
else
i
was
afraid
of
the
responsibility
of
acting
in
so
nice
a
case
an
everlasting
quarrel
might
come
out
of
it
so
i
covered
it
and
put
in
the
list
all
ready
to
be
sent
at
a
warning
and
then
i
amused
myself
with
it
while
you
were
away
now
brother
what
will
you
do
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
i
ordered
it
in
myself
as
mr
rowland
says
but
mrs
enderby
shall
have
it
at
once
because
she
is
ill
it
is
a
fine
large
type
for
her
and
she
will
pore
over
the
plates
and
forget
deerbrook
and
all
her
own
ailments
in
wondering
how
the
people
will
get
out
of
the
ice
do
you
remember
margaret
said
hester
how
she
looked
one
summer
day
like
a
ghost
from
the
grave
when
she
came
down
from
her
books
and
had
even
forgotten
her
shawl
oh
about
the
battle
cried
margaret
laughing
what
battle
asked
hope
an
historical
one
i
suppose
and
not
that
of
the
rowlands
and
greys
mrs
enderby
is
of
a
higher
order
than
the
rest
of
us
deerbrook
people
she
gets
most
of
her
news
and
all
her
battles
out
of
history
yes
she
alighted
among
us
to
tell
us
that
such
a
great
such
a
wonderful
battle
had
been
fought
at
a
place
called
blenheim
by
the
duke
of
marlborough
who
really
seemed
a
surprisingly
clever
man
it
was
such
a
good
thought
of
his
to
have
a
swamp
at
one
end
of
his
line
and
to
put
some
of
his
soldiers
behind
some
bushes
so
that
the
enemy
could
not
get
at
them
and
he
won
the
battle
this
book
will
be
the
very
thing
for
her
said
margaret
it
is
only
a
pity
that
it
did
not
come
in
at
midsummer
instead
of
christmas
i
am
afraid
she
will
sympathise
so
thoroughly
that
phoebe
will
never
be
able
to
put
on
coals
enough
to
warm
her
nay
said
mr
hope
it
is
better
as
it
is
she
must
be
told
now
at
all
events
whereas
if
this
book
came
to
her
at
midsummer
it
would
chill
her
whole
month
of
july
she
would
start
every
time
she
looked
out
of
her
window
and
saw
the
meadows
green
i
hope
she
is
not
really
very
ill
said
hester
you
were
thinking
the
same
thought
that
i
was
said
her
husband
starting
up
from
the
sofa
it
is
certainly
my
business
to
go
and
see
her
if
she
wishes
it
i
will
step
down
into
the
surgery
and
learn
if
there
is
any
message
from
her
and
if
there
is
not
from
her
there
will
be
from
some
one
else
said
hester
sorrowfully
what
a
cold
night
for
you
to
go
out
and
leave
this
warm
room
mr
hope
laughed
as
he
observed
what
an
innocent
speech
that
was
for
a
surgeon
wife
it
was
plain
that
her
education
in
that
capacity
had
not
begun
and
down
he
went
here
are
some
things
for
you
cards
and
notes
said
margaret
to
her
sister
as
she
opened
a
drawer
of
the
one
from
mrs
grey
marked
i
do
not
suppose
your
husband
may
not
see
it
but
that
is
your
affair
my
duty
is
to
give
it
you
privately
one
of
the
grey
mysteries
i
suppose
said
hester
colouring
and
tearing
open
the
letter
with
some
vehemence
these
mysteries
were
foolish
enough
before
they
are
ridiculous
now
so
you
are
going
out
cried
she
as
her
husband
came
in
with
his
hat
on
yes
the
old
lady
will
be
the
easier
for
my
seeing
her
this
evening
and
i
shall
carry
her
the
polar
sea
where
is
pen
and
ink
margaret
we
do
not
know
the
ways
of
our
own
house
yet
margaret
brought
pen
and
ink
and
while
mr
hope
wrote
down
the
dates
in
the
book
society
list
hester
exclaimed
against
mrs
grey
for
having
sent
her
a
letter
marked
private
now
that
she
was
married
if
you
mean
it
not
to
be
private
you
shall
tell
me
about
it
when
i
come
back
said
her
husband
if
i
see
mrs
enderby
i
must
be
gone
it
was
not
twenty
minutes
before
he
was
seated
by
his
own
fireside
again
his
wife
looked
disturbed
and
was
so
she
even
forgot
to
inquire
after
mrs
enderby
there
is
mrs
grey
precious
letter
said
she
she
may
mean
to
be
very
kind
to
me
i
dare
say
she
does
but
she
might
know
that
it
is
not
kindness
to
write
so
of
my
husband
i
do
not
see
that
she
writes
any
harm
of
me
my
dear
said
he
laying
the
letter
open
upon
the
table
she
only
wants
to
manage
me
a
little
and
that
is
her
way
you
know
so
exceedingly
impertinent
cried
hester
turning
to
margaret
she
wants
me
to
use
my
influence
quietly
and
without
betraying
her
to
make
my
husband
she
glanced
into
her
husband
face
and
checked
her
communication
in
short
she
said
mrs
grey
wants
to
be
meddling
between
my
husband
and
one
of
his
patients
well
what
then
said
margaret
what
then
why
if
she
is
to
be
interfering
already
in
our
affairs
if
she
is
to
be
always
fancying
that
she
has
anything
to
do
with
edward
and
we
living
so
near
i
shall
never
be
able
to
bear
it
and
hester
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
my
dear
is
it
possible
cried
edward
such
a
trifle
it
is
no
trifle
said
hester
trying
to
command
her
voice
it
can
never
be
a
trifle
to
me
that
any
one
shows
disrespect
to
you
i
shall
never
be
able
to
keep
terms
with
any
one
who
does
margaret
believed
that
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
put
a
stop
to
any
such
attempts
if
indeed
they
were
serious
mrs
grey
was
so
fond
of
hester
that
she
would
permit
anything
from
her
and
it
would
be
easy
for
hester
to
say
that
not
wishing
to
receive
any
exclusively
private
letters
she
had
shown
mrs
grey
to
her
husband
though
to
no
one
else
and
that
it
was
to
be
the
principle
of
the
family
not
to
interfere
more
or
less
with
mr
hope
professional
affairs
or
better
still
take
no
notice
of
the
matter
in
any
way
whatever
this
time
said
mr
hope
we
can
let
her
have
her
way
while
we
keep
our
own
can
not
we
so
let
us
put
the
mysterious
epistle
into
the
fire
shall
we
i
wait
your
leave
said
he
laughing
as
he
held
the
letter
over
the
flame
it
is
your
property
hester
signed
to
have
it
burned
but
she
could
not
forget
it
she
recurred
to
mrs
grey
again
and
again
so
near
as
they
lived
she
said
so
much
as
they
must
be
together
the
nearer
we
all
live
and
the
more
we
must
be
with
our
neighbours
said
her
husband
the
more
important
it
is
that
we
should
allow
each
other
our
own
ways
you
will
soon
find
what
it
is
to
live
in
a
village
my
love
and
then
you
will
not
mind
these
little
trifles
if
they
would
meddle
only
with
me
said
hester
i
should
not
mind
i
hope
you
do
not
think
i
should
care
so
much
for
anything
they
could
say
or
do
about
me
if
they
only
would
let
you
alone
that
is
the
last
thing
we
can
expect
said
margaret
do
they
let
any
public
man
alone
dr
levitt
or
mr
james
or
the
parish
clerk
added
mr
hope
it
was
reported
lately
that
steps
were
to
be
taken
to
intimate
to
owen
that
it
was
a
constant
habit
of
his
to
cough
as
he
took
his
seat
in
the
desk
i
was
told
once
myself
that
it
was
remarked
throughout
deerbrook
that
i
seemed
to
be
half
whistling
as
i
walked
up
the
street
in
the
mornings
and
that
it
was
considered
a
practice
too
undignified
for
my
profession
hester
colour
rose
again
margaret
laughed
and
asked
what
did
you
do
i
made
my
best
bow
and
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
till
events
brought
it
to
mind
again
at
this
moment
so
hester
suppose
we
think
no
more
of
mrs
grey
hints
seeing
that
her
brow
did
not
entirely
clear
he
took
his
seat
by
her
saying
supposing
love
that
her
letter
does
not
show
enough
deference
to
my
important
self
to
satisfy
you
still
it
remains
that
we
owe
respect
to
mrs
grey
she
is
one
of
my
oldest
and
most
hospitable
and
faithful
friends
here
and
i
need
say
nothing
of
her
attachment
to
you
can
not
we
overlook
in
her
one
little
error
of
judgment
oh
yes
certainly
said
hester
cheerfully
then
i
will
say
nothing
to
her
unless
she
asks
and
then
tell
her
as
lightly
as
i
may
what
margaret
proposed
just
now
so
be
it
and
all
was
bright
and
smooth
again
to
all
appearance
but
this
little
cloud
did
not
pass
away
without
leaving
its
gloom
in
more
hearts
than
one
as
margaret
set
down
her
lamp
on
her
own
and
sank
into
the
chair
of
whose
ease
she
had
bidden
maria
make
trial
she
might
have
decided
if
she
had
happened
at
the
moment
to
remember
the
conversation
that
the
pleasure
of
solitude
does
depend
much
on
the
ease
of
the
thoughts
she
sat
long
wondering
how
she
could
have
overlooked
the
obvious
probability
that
hester
instead
of
finding
the
habit
of
mind
of
a
lifetime
altered
by
the
circumstances
of
love
and
marriage
would
henceforth
suffer
from
jealousy
for
her
husband
in
addition
to
the
burden
she
had
borne
for
herself
long
did
margaret
sit
there
turning
her
voluntary
musings
on
the
joy
of
their
meeting
and
the
perfect
picture
of
comfort
which
their
little
party
had
presented
but
perpetually
recurring
against
her
will
to
the
trouble
which
had
succeeded
and
following
back
the
track
of
this
cloud
to
see
whether
there
were
more
in
the
wind
whether
it
did
not
come
from
a
horizon
of
storm
yet
hers
was
not
the
most
troubled
spirit
in
the
house
vexation
had
passed
away
and
she
was
unconscious
as
sufferers
of
her
class
usually
are
of
the
disturbance
she
had
caused
she
presently
slept
and
was
at
peace
not
so
her
husband
a
strange
trouble
a
fearful
suspicion
had
seized
upon
him
he
was
amazed
at
the
return
of
his
feelings
about
margaret
and
filled
with
horror
when
he
thought
of
the
days
and
months
and
years
of
close
domestic
companionship
with
her
from
which
there
was
no
escape
there
was
no
escape
the
peace
of
his
wife
of
margaret
his
own
peace
in
theirs
depended
wholly
on
the
deep
secrecy
in
which
he
should
preserve
the
mistake
he
had
made
it
was
a
mistake
he
could
scarcely
endure
the
thought
but
it
was
so
for
some
months
he
had
never
had
a
doubt
that
he
was
absolutely
in
the
road
of
duty
and
if
some
apprehension
about
his
entire
happiness
had
chilled
him
from
time
to
time
he
had
cast
them
off
as
inconsistent
with
the
resolution
of
his
conscience
now
he
feared
he
felt
he
had
mistaken
his
duty
as
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
the
apprehension
assailed
him
that
he
had
thrown
away
the
opportunity
and
the
promise
of
his
life
that
he
had
desecrated
his
own
home
and
doomed
to
withering
the
best
affections
of
his
nature
he
for
the
moment
wished
himself
dead
but
his
was
a
soul
never
long
thrown
off
its
balance
he
convinced
himself
in
the
course
of
a
long
sleepless
night
that
whatever
might
have
been
his
errors
his
way
was
now
clear
though
difficult
he
must
devote
himself
wholly
to
her
whose
devotion
to
him
had
caused
him
his
present
struggles
and
he
must
trust
that
if
margaret
did
not
ere
long
remove
from
the
daily
companionship
which
must
be
his
sorest
trial
he
should
grow
perpetually
stronger
in
his
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
that
no
human
being
suspected
the
real
state
of
his
mind
this
was
a
comfort
and
support
of
something
else
he
felt
nearly
certain
that
margaret
loved
philip
this
was
another
comfort
if
he
could
only
feel
it
so
and
he
had
little
doubt
that
philip
loved
her
he
had
also
a
deep
conviction
which
he
now
aroused
for
his
support
that
no
consecration
of
a
home
is
so
holy
as
that
of
a
kindly
trustful
spirit
in
him
who
is
the
head
and
life
of
his
house
if
there
was
in
himself
a
love
which
must
be
denied
there
was
also
one
which
might
be
indulged
without
trammelling
himself
with
vows
he
cheered
his
soul
with
the
image
of
the
life
he
might
yet
fulfil
shedding
on
all
under
his
charge
the
blessings
of
his
activity
patience
and
love
and
daily
casting
off
the
burden
of
the
day
leaving
all
care
for
the
morrow
to
such
as
happier
than
himself
would
have
the
future
the
image
of
the
present
chapter
seventeen
first
hospitality
the
greys
needed
only
to
be
asked
to
come
and
dine
before
the
rest
of
the
world
could
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
bride
and
bridegroom
they
had
previously
settled
among
themselves
that
they
should
be
invited
and
the
answer
was
given
on
the
instant
the
only
doubt
was
how
far
down
in
the
family
the
pleasure
ought
to
extend
sydney
was
full
of
anxiety
about
it
his
mother
decided
that
he
ought
to
be
asked
but
that
perhaps
he
had
better
not
go
as
he
would
be
in
the
way
and
sophia
was
sure
it
would
be
very
dull
for
him
a
sentence
which
made
sydney
rather
sulky
but
hester
insisted
on
having
him
and
pleaded
that
william
levitt
would
come
and
meet
him
and
if
the
lads
should
find
the
dull
there
was
the
surgery
with
some
very
curious
things
in
it
where
they
might
be
able
to
amuse
themselves
so
sydney
was
to
take
up
his
lot
with
the
elderly
ones
and
the
little
girls
were
to
be
somewhat
differently
entertained
another
day
oh
the
anxieties
of
a
young
wife
first
if
remembered
they
become
laughable
enough
when
looked
back
upon
from
future
years
but
they
are
no
laughing
matter
at
the
time
the
terror
lest
there
should
be
too
little
on
the
table
and
the
consequent
danger
of
there
being
too
much
the
fear
at
once
of
worrying
the
cook
with
too
many
directions
and
leaving
any
necessary
thing
unsaid
the
trembling
doubt
of
any
power
of
entertainment
that
may
exist
in
the
house
the
anticipation
of
a
yawn
on
the
part
of
any
guest
or
of
such
a
silence
as
may
make
the
creaking
of
the
footboy
shoes
heard
at
dinner
or
the
striking
of
the
hall
clock
in
the
evening
these
are
the
apprehensions
which
make
the
young
wife
wish
herself
on
the
other
side
of
her
first
and
render
alluring
the
prospect
of
sitting
down
next
day
to
hash
or
cold
fowl
followed
by
odd
custards
and
tartlets
with
a
stray
where
a
guest
so
experienced
and
so
vigilant
as
mrs
grey
is
expected
the
anxiety
is
redoubled
and
the
servants
are
sure
to
discover
it
by
some
means
or
other
morris
woke
this
saturday
morning
with
the
feeling
that
something
great
was
to
happen
that
day
and
sally
began
to
be
sharp
with
the
footboy
as
early
as
ten
hester
and
margaret
were
surprised
to
find
how
soon
there
was
nothing
more
left
for
them
to
do
the
wine
was
decanted
the
dessert
dished
up
in
the
little
storeroom
and
even
the
cake
cut
for
tea
soon
enough
to
leave
almost
the
whole
morning
to
be
spent
as
usual
margaret
sat
down
to
study
german
and
hester
to
read
she
had
just
observed
that
they
could
not
expect
to
see
edward
for
some
hours
as
he
had
been
sent
for
to
the
almshouses
and
meant
to
pay
a
country
visit
which
would
cost
him
a
circuit
on
his
return
these
almshouses
were
six
miles
off
and
when
mr
hope
was
sent
for
by
one
of
the
inmates
nearly
all
the
rest
were
wont
to
discover
that
they
ailed
more
or
less
so
that
their
medical
guardian
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
get
away
and
his
horse
had
learned
by
practice
to
stand
longer
there
than
anywhere
else
without
fidgeting
knowing
this
margaret
fully
agreed
to
her
sister
proposition
that
it
must
be
some
hours
before
edward
could
appear
in
a
little
while
however
hester
threw
down
her
book
and
took
up
her
work
laying
her
watch
just
under
her
eyes
upon
the
table
do
you
mean
to
do
that
for
life
when
your
husband
takes
a
country
ride
said
margaret
laughing
i
hate
these
everlasting
country
rides
cried
hester
i
do
wish
he
would
give
up
those
almshouses
give
them
up
yes
they
are
nothing
but
trouble
and
anxiety
the
old
folks
are
never
satisfied
and
never
would
be
if
he
lived
among
them
and
attended
to
nobody
else
and
as
often
as
he
goes
there
he
is
sure
to
be
more
wanted
here
than
at
any
other
time
there
is
another
knock
there
have
been
two
people
wanting
him
within
this
hour
and
a
country
gentleman
has
left
word
that
he
shall
call
with
his
daughter
at
one
well
let
them
come
if
he
is
home
well
and
good
if
not
they
must
wait
till
he
arrives
hester
started
up
and
walked
about
the
room
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
said
margaret
the
truth
is
you
are
afraid
of
another
accident
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
but
dearest
hester
you
must
control
this
fear
consider
supposing
it
to
be
pleasure
that
you
and
he
should
live
for
forty
or
fifty
years
together
what
a
world
of
anxiety
you
will
inflict
on
yourself
if
you
are
to
suffer
in
this
way
every
time
he
rides
six
miles
out
and
back
again
perhaps
i
shall
grow
used
to
it
but
i
do
wish
he
would
give
up
those
almshouses
suppose
we
ask
him
to
give
up
practice
at
once
said
margaret
that
we
may
have
him
always
with
us
no
no
hester
we
must
consider
him
first
and
ourselves
next
and
let
him
have
his
profession
all
to
himself
and
as
much
of
it
as
he
likes
ourselves
cried
hester
contemptuously
well
yourself
then
said
margaret
smiling
i
only
put
myself
in
that
i
might
lecture
myself
at
the
same
time
with
you
lecture
away
dear
said
hester
till
you
make
me
as
reasonable
as
if
i
had
no
husband
to
care
for
margaret
might
have
asked
whether
hester
had
been
reasonable
when
she
had
had
neither
husband
nor
lover
to
care
for
but
instead
of
this
she
opened
the
piano
and
tempted
her
sister
away
from
her
watch
to
practise
a
duet
i
will
tell
you
what
i
am
thinking
of
cried
hester
breaking
off
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
of
the
second
page
perhaps
you
thought
me
hasty
just
now
but
you
do
not
know
what
i
had
in
my
head
you
remember
how
late
edward
was
called
out
the
night
before
last
to
mrs
marsh
child
yes
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
went
there
was
no
moon
mr
marsh
wanted
to
send
a
servant
back
with
him
as
far
as
the
but
he
was
sure
he
knew
the
way
he
was
riding
very
fast
when
his
horse
suddenly
stopped
and
almost
threw
him
over
its
head
he
spurred
in
vain
the
animal
only
turned
round
and
round
till
a
voice
called
from
somewhere
near
there
for
god
sake
wait
till
i
bring
a
light
a
man
soon
came
with
a
lantern
and
where
do
you
think
edward
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
a
another
step
in
the
dark
night
and
he
might
have
been
heard
of
no
more
margaret
was
not
at
all
surprised
that
hester
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
at
the
end
of
this
very
disagreeable
anecdote
it
is
clear
said
she
that
edward
is
the
person
who
wants
lecturing
we
must
bid
him
not
ride
very
fast
on
dark
nights
on
roads
that
he
does
not
know
but
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
this
horse
of
his
one
of
the
two
is
prudent
and
that
is
a
great
comfort
and
for
the
present
there
is
the
consolation
that
there
are
no
in
the
way
to
the
almshouses
and
that
it
is
broad
daylight
so
let
us
go
on
with
our
duet
or
shall
we
begin
again
hester
played
through
the
duet
and
then
sighed
over
a
new
apprehension
that
some
of
those
old
invalids
would
certainly
be
taking
mr
hope
away
from
home
on
the
two
mornings
when
their
neighbours
were
to
pay
the
wedding
visit
and
what
shall
we
do
then
she
inquired
we
shall
see
when
the
time
comes
replied
margaret
meanwhile
we
are
sure
of
one
good
thing
that
edward
will
not
be
called
away
from
the
by
the
almshouse
people
come
let
us
play
this
over
once
more
that
it
may
be
ready
for
mr
grey
in
the
evening
sooner
than
he
was
looked
for
sooner
than
it
was
supposed
possible
that
he
could
have
come
edward
appeared
safe
cried
he
laughing
what
should
prevent
my
being
safe
what
sort
of
a
soldier
or
sailor
wife
would
you
have
made
he
asked
looking
in
hester
happy
face
she
would
be
crazed
with
every
gale
and
die
at
of
wars
said
margaret
are
horror
enough
for
her
and
to
say
the
truth
brother
for
other
people
too
while
you
ride
as
you
do
that
was
an
accident
which
can
not
recur
observed
hope
i
am
sorry
mr
marsh
man
mentioned
it
but
hester
i
see
what
you
would
say
sighed
hester
your
mention
of
and
sailors
wives
reminds
me
i
have
no
faith
i
know
and
i
thought
i
should
when
oh
i
wonder
how
those
old
crusaders
wives
endured
their
lives
but
perhaps
seven
years
suspense
was
easier
to
bear
than
seven
hours
hester
joined
in
the
laugh
at
this
speech
and
edward
went
to
see
his
patients
in
a
place
where
there
was
really
no
danger
in
the
yet
hester
was
a
little
ruffled
when
the
greys
appeared
so
many
messages
had
arrived
for
edward
that
the
country
gentleman
and
his
daughter
had
been
kept
waiting
and
a
livery
servant
had
called
twice
as
if
impatient
she
was
afraid
that
people
would
blame
edward
that
he
would
never
manage
to
satisfy
them
all
her
colour
was
raised
and
her
brow
slightly
bent
when
her
guests
entered
but
all
was
right
when
edward
followed
looking
perfectly
at
leisure
and
stood
talking
before
the
fire
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
no
profession
mr
hope
had
caused
his
feelings
to
be
so
well
understood
on
one
important
subject
that
it
was
necessary
to
respect
them
and
no
mention
of
the
rowlands
was
made
either
before
dinner
or
in
the
presence
of
the
servants
nor
was
there
any
need
of
the
topic
there
was
abundance
to
be
said
without
having
recourse
to
doubtful
subjects
and
margaret
became
so
far
relieved
from
all
apprehension
on
this
account
by
the
time
the
cheese
appeared
that
she
assured
herself
that
the
day
was
passing
off
extremely
well
there
had
not
been
a
single
pause
left
to
be
filled
up
with
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
mrs
grey
pronounced
the
room
delightfully
warm
sophia
protested
that
she
liked
having
the
fire
at
her
back
and
mr
grey
inquired
where
hope
got
his
ale
the
boys
who
had
looked
for
the
first
as
if
they
could
not
speak
for
the
stiffness
of
their
collars
were
now
in
a
full
career
of
jokes
to
judge
by
their
stifled
laughter
hester
blushed
beautifully
at
every
little
circumstance
that
occurred
and
played
the
hostess
very
gracefully
the
day
was
going
off
extremely
well
the
approaching
county
election
was
the
principal
topic
at
dinner
as
it
was
probably
at
every
in
deerbrook
mrs
grey
first
told
hope
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
all
about
her
wonder
at
seeing
seven
or
eight
gentlemen
on
horseback
entering
their
field
she
was
exceedingly
surprised
to
observe
such
a
troop
approaching
the
door
and
she
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
when
the
servant
came
in
to
say
that
the
gentlemen
wished
to
see
her
as
mr
grey
was
at
a
distance
at
market
that
day
it
was
strange
that
she
should
so
entirely
forget
that
there
was
to
be
an
election
soon
to
be
sure
it
might
have
occurred
to
her
that
the
party
came
to
canvass
mr
grey
but
she
did
not
happen
to
remember
at
first
and
she
thought
the
gentleman
who
was
spokesman
excessively
complimentary
both
about
the
place
and
about
some
other
things
till
he
mentioned
his
name
and
that
he
was
candidate
for
the
county
such
a
highly
complimentary
strain
was
not
to
her
taste
she
acknowledged
and
it
lost
all
its
value
when
it
was
made
so
common
as
in
this
instance
this
gentleman
had
kissed
the
little
rowlands
all
round
she
had
since
been
assured
not
that
she
wished
to
enlarge
on
that
subject
but
it
only
showed
what
gentlemen
will
do
when
they
are
canvassing
the
other
candidate
mr
lowry
seemed
a
very
high
personage
indeed
when
he
found
mr
grey
was
not
at
home
he
and
all
his
party
rode
straight
on
without
inquiring
for
the
ladies
everyone
seemed
to
think
that
mr
lowry
was
not
likely
to
carry
his
election
his
manners
were
so
extremely
high
meanwhile
mr
grey
was
observing
to
his
hostess
that
he
was
sorry
to
find
there
was
an
election
impending
people
in
a
small
place
like
deerbrook
were
quite
apt
enough
to
quarrel
day
by
day
an
election
threw
the
place
into
an
uproar
delightful
those
boys
are
thinking
said
hester
laughing
i
am
sure
said
sophia
it
is
anything
but
delightful
to
me
i
remember
last
time
sydney
brought
some
squibs
into
the
garden
and
let
them
off
while
mamma
and
i
were
in
the
shrubbery
and
we
could
none
of
us
get
to
sleep
till
after
midnight
for
the
light
of
the
bonfire
down
the
street
they
should
manage
those
things
more
quietly
observed
mr
grey
this
time
however
there
will
be
only
a
little
effusion
of
joy
and
then
an
end
for
they
say
ballinger
will
carry
every
vote
in
the
place
why
father
cried
sydney
are
you
going
to
vote
for
ballinger
this
time
no
my
boy
i
did
not
say
so
i
shall
not
vote
at
all
he
added
observing
that
he
was
expected
to
explain
himself
no
remark
being
made
he
continued
it
will
not
be
convenient
to
me
to
meddle
in
election
matters
this
time
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
as
lowry
has
not
the
slightest
chance
one
gets
nothing
but
and
trouble
by
meddling
so
my
dear
turning
to
hester
your
husband
and
i
will
just
keep
quiet
and
let
deerbrook
have
its
own
way
i
believe
you
may
speak
for
yourself
replied
hester
her
eyes
sparkling
edward
has
no
idea
then
remembering
that
she
was
speaking
to
a
guest
she
cut
short
her
assurance
that
edward
had
no
idea
of
neglecting
his
duty
when
it
was
wanted
most
for
such
a
reason
as
that
it
was
then
most
irksome
there
is
no
occasion
in
the
world
for
your
husband
to
come
forward
observed
mr
grey
with
kind
anxiety
i
was
saying
hope
that
you
are
quite
absolved
from
interfering
in
politics
nobody
expects
it
from
a
medical
man
everyone
knows
the
disadvantage
to
a
professional
man
circumstanced
like
you
of
taking
any
side
in
a
party
matter
you
might
find
the
consequences
very
serious
i
assure
you
and
nobody
expects
it
of
a
medical
man
echoed
mrs
grey
mr
hope
did
not
reply
that
he
voted
for
other
reasons
than
that
it
was
expected
of
him
he
had
argued
the
subject
with
mr
grey
before
and
knew
that
they
must
agree
to
differ
he
quietly
declared
his
intention
of
voting
for
mr
lowry
and
then
asked
sophia
to
take
wine
his
manner
left
no
resource
to
mrs
grey
but
to
express
her
feelings
to
his
wife
in
the
after
dinner
she
there
drew
hester
arm
within
her
own
and
kindly
observed
what
pleasure
it
gave
her
to
see
her
anticipations
so
fulfilled
she
had
had
this
home
fitted
up
and
inhabited
as
it
now
was
in
her
mind
eye
for
a
longer
time
than
she
should
choose
to
tell
elderly
folks
might
be
allowed
to
look
forward
and
mr
grey
could
bear
witness
that
she
had
done
so
it
was
delightful
to
look
round
and
see
how
all
had
come
to
pass
everybody
is
so
interested
observed
sophia
mrs
howell
says
some
have
observed
to
her
what
a
pity
it
is
that
you
are
dissenters
so
that
you
will
not
be
at
church
on
sunday
everybody
would
be
sure
to
be
there
and
she
says
she
is
of
opinion
that
considering
how
many
friends
wish
to
see
you
make
your
first
appearance
you
ought
to
go
for
once
she
can
not
imagine
what
harm
it
could
do
you
to
go
for
once
but
whatever
you
may
think
about
that
it
shows
her
interest
and
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
it
have
you
seen
mrs
howell
window
my
dear
how
should
they
exclaimed
her
mother
i
forgot
they
could
not
go
out
before
sunday
but
margaret
you
must
look
at
mrs
howell
window
the
first
thing
when
you
can
get
out
it
is
so
festooned
with
purple
and
white
that
i
told
miss
miskin
i
thought
they
would
be
obliged
to
light
up
in
the
daytime
they
have
made
the
shop
so
dark
and
they
have
thrust
all
the
green
and
orange
into
the
little
side
window
where
nobody
can
see
it
cried
sydney
you
managed
to
see
it
i
perceive
said
hester
sydney
having
at
the
moment
mounted
a
cockade
and
drawn
out
his
green
and
orange
into
the
fullest
view
william
levitt
lost
no
time
in
going
through
the
same
process
with
his
purple
and
white
you
will
be
the
ornaments
of
deerbrook
said
margaret
if
you
walk
about
in
that
gay
style
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
both
in
the
street
that
i
may
judge
of
the
effect
they
will
have
lost
their
finery
by
that
time
said
sophia
we
had
a
terrible
snatching
of
cockades
last
time
snatching
let
them
try
to
snatch
mine
and
see
what
they
get
by
it
cried
sydney
what
would
they
get
but
the
ribbons
asked
margaret
sydney
drew
her
to
the
light
opened
the
bows
of
his
cockade
and
displayed
a
stuck
upright
under
each
bow
is
it
horrid
said
sophia
horrid
it
is
not
half
so
horrid
as
and
sydney
related
how
had
actually
been
used
during
the
last
election
to
detain
with
their
barbs
the
fingers
of
snatchers
of
cockades
which
do
you
use
he
asked
of
william
levitt
neither
my
father
wo
let
me
do
anything
more
than
just
wear
a
cockade
and
i
have
got
a
too
you
see
for
fear
of
losing
my
watch
but
you
wo
get
my
cockade
off
a
bit
the
sooner
for
my
having
no
spikes
under
it
i
have
a
particular
way
of
fastening
it
on
only
try
any
day
i
defy
you
to
it
hush
hush
boys
do
talk
of
defiance
said
mrs
grey
i
am
sure
i
wish
there
were
no
such
things
as
elections
in
country
places
at
least
they
make
nothing
but
mischief
and
indeed
hester
my
dear
it
is
a
great
pity
that
those
should
meddle
who
can
keep
out
of
them
as
your
husband
fairly
may
whichever
way
he
might
vote
a
great
many
disagreeable
remarks
would
be
made
and
if
he
votes
as
he
says
for
mr
lowry
i
really
think
and
so
does
mr
grey
that
it
will
be
a
serious
injury
to
him
in
his
profession
hester
replied
with
some
gravity
that
people
could
never
do
their
whole
duty
without
causing
disagreeable
remarks
and
seldom
without
suffering
serious
injury
but
why
should
he
vote
persisted
mrs
grey
because
he
considers
it
his
duty
which
is
commonly
his
reason
for
whatever
he
does
an
excellent
reason
too
but
i
rather
thought
i
always
fancied
he
defended
acting
from
impulse
but
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
and
she
nodded
and
winked
towards
the
young
people
who
were
trying
the
impression
of
a
new
seal
at
the
centre
table
heeding
nothing
about
either
duty
or
impulse
margaret
had
fixed
the
attention
of
the
boys
upon
this
curious
seal
of
hers
in
order
to
obviate
a
snatching
of
cockades
or
other
political
feud
upon
the
spot
it
seems
as
if
i
could
speak
about
nothing
but
your
husband
my
dear
continued
mrs
grey
in
a
whisper
but
you
know
i
feel
towards
him
as
towards
a
son
as
i
have
told
him
do
you
think
he
has
quite
entirely
got
over
his
accident
entirely
he
thinks
he
calls
himself
in
perfect
health
well
he
ought
to
know
best
but
but
what
asked
hester
anxiously
it
has
occurred
to
us
that
he
may
still
want
watching
and
care
it
has
struck
both
mr
grey
and
me
that
he
is
not
quite
the
same
that
he
was
before
that
accident
it
is
natural
enough
and
yet
i
thought
in
the
autumn
that
he
was
entirely
himself
again
but
there
is
still
a
little
difference
a
little
flatness
of
spirits
sometimes
a
little
more
gravity
than
used
to
be
natural
to
him
but
you
do
not
think
he
looks
ill
tell
me
just
what
you
think
oh
no
not
ill
rather
delicate
perhaps
but
i
am
sure
it
is
wonderful
that
he
is
so
well
after
such
an
accident
he
calls
himself
perfectly
well
does
he
perfectly
oh
then
we
may
be
quite
easy
for
he
must
know
best
do
not
let
anything
that
i
have
said
dwell
upon
your
mind
my
dear
i
only
just
thought
i
would
ask
how
common
it
is
for
one
friends
to
drop
a
heavy
weight
upon
heart
and
then
desire
one
not
to
let
it
dwell
there
hester
spirits
were
irrecoverably
damped
for
this
evening
her
husband
seemed
to
be
an
altered
man
flat
in
spirits
and
looking
delicate
and
she
told
not
to
be
uneasy
she
was
most
eager
for
the
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
from
the
that
she
might
watch
him
and
till
they
came
she
had
not
a
word
of
amusement
to
furnish
to
her
guests
margaret
perceived
that
something
had
gone
wrong
and
talked
industriously
till
reinforced
from
the
sophia
whispered
a
hint
to
her
mother
to
inquire
particularly
about
mrs
enderby
health
at
the
mention
of
her
name
mr
hope
took
his
seat
on
the
sofa
beside
mrs
grey
and
replied
gravely
and
fully
that
he
thought
mrs
enderby
really
very
unwell
more
so
than
he
had
ever
known
her
she
was
occasionally
in
a
state
of
great
suffering
and
any
attention
that
her
old
friends
could
show
her
in
the
way
of
a
quiet
call
would
be
a
true
kindness
had
he
alarmed
her
family
there
was
quite
hint
enough
for
alarm
he
said
in
the
state
in
which
her
relations
saw
her
at
times
but
mrs
rowland
was
always
trying
to
make
out
that
nothing
was
the
matter
with
her
mother
was
it
not
so
not
exactly
so
mrs
rowland
knew
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
that
her
mother
might
live
many
months
or
even
a
few
years
but
mr
hope
believed
neither
mrs
rowland
nor
any
one
else
could
deny
her
sufferings
they
say
mr
philip
is
coming
observed
mr
grey
oh
i
hope
he
is
cried
sydney
turning
round
to
listen
some
people
say
that
he
is
otherwise
occupied
observed
sophia
if
all
accounts
be
true
she
caught
her
mother
eye
and
stopped
suddenly
and
awkwardly
mr
hope
involuntarily
glanced
at
margaret
as
one
or
two
others
were
doing
at
the
same
time
nothing
was
to
be
discerned
for
she
was
stooping
over
the
volume
of
engravings
that
she
was
showing
to
william
levitt
and
she
remained
stooping
for
a
long
while
when
the
proper
amount
of
playing
and
singing
had
been
gone
through
and
mrs
grey
sedan
was
announced
the
cloaked
and
muffled
guest
left
behind
a
not
very
happy
party
margaret
gaiety
seemed
exhausted
and
she
asked
if
it
was
not
late
hester
was
gazing
at
her
husband
she
saw
the
perspiration
on
his
brow
she
put
her
arm
within
his
and
anxiously
inquired
whether
he
was
not
unwell
she
was
sure
he
had
never
fully
recovered
his
strength
she
had
not
taken
care
enough
of
him
why
did
he
not
tell
her
when
he
was
weary
and
wanted
nursing
mr
hope
looked
at
her
with
an
unaffected
surprise
which
went
far
to
console
her
and
assured
her
that
he
was
perfectly
well
and
that
moreover
he
was
so
fond
of
indulgence
that
she
would
be
sure
to
hear
of
it
if
ever
he
could
find
a
pretence
for
getting
upon
the
sofa
hester
was
comforted
but
said
that
his
spirits
were
not
always
what
they
had
been
and
she
appealed
to
margaret
margaret
declared
that
any
failure
of
spirits
in
edward
was
such
a
new
idea
that
she
must
consider
before
she
gave
an
answer
she
thought
that
he
had
been
too
busy
to
draw
so
many
caricatures
as
usual
lately
but
she
had
observed
no
deeper
signs
of
despondency
than
that
do
not
let
us
get
into
the
habit
of
talking
about
spirits
said
hope
i
hear
quite
enough
about
that
away
from
home
and
i
can
assure
you
professionally
that
it
is
a
bad
subject
to
dwell
upon
every
one
who
lives
has
variations
of
spirits
they
are
like
the
sunshine
or
like
dr
levitt
last
sermon
of
which
mrs
enderby
says
every
sunday
in
the
church
porch
is
to
be
felt
not
talked
about
but
as
a
sign
of
health
said
hester
as
a
sign
of
health
my
dear
the
spirits
of
all
this
household
may
be
left
to
my
professional
discrimination
will
you
trust
me
my
dear
oh
yes
she
uttered
with
a
sigh
of
relief
chapter
eighteen
grandmamma
in
retreat
i
am
better
now
phoebe
said
mrs
enderby
sinking
back
faintly
in
her
after
one
of
her
attacks
of
spasms
i
am
better
now
and
if
you
will
fan
me
for
a
minute
or
two
i
shall
be
quite
fit
to
see
the
children
quite
delighted
to
have
them
i
declare
said
the
maid
here
are
the
drops
standing
upon
your
face
this
cold
day
as
if
it
was
august
but
if
the
pain
is
cone
never
mind
anything
else
and
i
for
one
wo
say
anything
against
your
having
the
children
in
for
i
sure
the
seeing
your
friends
has
done
you
no
harm
and
nothing
but
good
pray
draw
up
the
blind
phoebe
and
let
me
see
something
of
the
sunshine
bless
me
how
frosty
the
field
looks
while
i
have
been
stifled
with
heat
for
this
hour
past
i
had
better
not
go
to
the
window
however
for
i
begin
to
feel
almost
chilly
already
thank
you
phoebe
you
have
fanned
me
enough
now
call
the
children
phoebe
phoebe
wrapped
a
cloak
about
her
mistress
knees
pinned
her
shawl
up
closer
around
her
throat
and
went
to
call
the
children
in
from
the
parlour
below
matilda
drew
up
her
head
and
flattened
her
back
and
then
asked
her
grandmamma
how
she
did
george
looked
up
anxiously
in
the
old
lady
face
ah
george
said
she
smiling
it
is
an
odd
face
to
look
at
is
not
it
how
would
you
like
your
face
to
look
as
mine
does
not
at
all
said
george
mrs
enderby
laughed
heartily
and
then
told
him
that
her
face
was
not
unlike
his
once
as
round
and
as
red
and
as
shining
in
frosty
weather
perhaps
if
you
were
to
go
out
now
into
the
frost
your
face
would
look
as
it
used
to
do
i
am
afraid
not
when
my
face
looked
like
yours
it
was
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
used
to
slide
and
make
snowballs
as
you
do
that
was
a
long
time
ago
my
face
is
wrinkled
now
because
i
am
old
and
it
is
pale
because
i
am
george
heard
nothing
after
the
word
snowballs
i
wish
some
more
snow
would
come
he
observed
we
have
plenty
of
ice
down
in
the
meadows
but
there
has
been
only
one
fall
of
snow
and
that
melted
almost
directly
papa
thinks
there
will
be
more
snow
very
soon
observed
matilda
if
there
is
you
children
can
do
something
for
me
that
i
should
like
very
much
said
grandmamma
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
is
yes
you
can
make
a
in
that
field
i
am
sure
mr
grey
will
give
you
leave
what
good
will
that
do
you
asked
matilda
i
can
sit
here
and
watch
you
and
i
shall
like
that
exceedingly
i
shall
see
you
gathering
the
snow
and
building
up
your
man
and
if
you
will
turn
about
and
shake
your
hand
this
way
now
and
then
i
shall
be
sure
to
observe
it
and
i
shall
think
you
are
saying
something
kind
to
me
i
wish
the
snow
would
come
cried
george
stamping
with
impatience
i
do
not
believe
mamma
will
let
us
observed
matilda
she
prohibits
our
going
into
mr
grey
field
but
she
shall
let
us
that
one
time
cried
george
i
will
ask
papa
and
mr
grey
and
sydney
and
uncle
philip
and
all
when
will
uncle
philip
come
again
some
time
soon
i
dare
say
but
george
we
must
do
as
your
mamma
pleases
about
my
plan
you
know
if
she
does
not
wish
you
to
go
into
mr
grey
field
you
can
make
your
somewhere
else
but
then
you
wo
see
us
but
i
know
what
i
will
do
i
will
speak
to
sydney
and
he
and
fanny
and
mary
shall
make
you
a
yonder
where
we
should
have
made
him
mrs
enderby
pressed
the
boy
to
her
and
laughed
while
she
thanked
him
but
said
it
was
not
the
same
thing
seeing
the
greys
make
a
why
george
said
matilda
contemptuously
when
uncle
philip
come
asked
the
boy
who
was
of
opinion
that
uncle
philip
could
bring
all
things
to
pass
why
i
will
tell
you
how
it
is
my
dear
uncle
philip
is
very
busy
learning
his
lessons
the
boy
stared
yes
people
who
mean
to
be
great
lawyers
as
i
believe
uncle
philip
does
have
to
learn
lessons
like
little
boys
only
much
longer
and
much
harder
when
will
he
have
done
them
not
for
a
long
while
yet
but
he
will
make
a
holiday
some
time
soon
and
come
to
see
us
i
should
like
to
get
well
before
that
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
and
sometimes
i
think
not
does
he
expect
you
will
he
expects
nothing
about
it
he
does
not
know
that
i
am
ill
i
do
not
wish
that
he
should
know
it
my
dears
so
when
i
feel
particularly
well
and
when
i
have
heard
anything
that
pleases
me
i
ask
phoebe
to
bring
me
the
pen
and
ink
and
i
write
to
uncle
philip
and
why
does
not
mamma
tell
him
how
you
are
ah
why
indeed
muttered
phoebe
she
knows
that
i
do
not
wish
it
uncle
philip
writes
charming
long
letters
to
me
as
i
will
show
you
bring
me
my
reticule
here
here
is
a
large
sheet
of
paper
quite
full
you
see
under
the
seal
and
all
when
will
you
write
such
long
letters
i
wonder
i
shall
when
i
am
married
i
suppose
said
matilda
again
drawing
up
her
little
head
you
married
my
love
and
pray
when
are
you
to
be
married
mamma
often
talks
of
the
time
when
she
shall
lose
me
and
of
what
things
have
to
be
done
while
she
has
me
with
her
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
indeed
love
before
that
day
if
it
ever
comes
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
losing
a
child
observed
phoebe
in
her
straightforward
way
if
mrs
rowland
thinks
so
long
beforehand
of
the
one
way
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
keeps
miss
matilda
up
to
the
thought
of
the
other
which
must
happen
sooner
or
later
while
marrying
may
not
well
phoebe
said
the
old
lady
we
will
not
put
any
dismal
thoughts
into
this
little
head
time
enough
for
that
we
will
leave
all
that
to
miss
young
then
stroking
matilda
round
cheek
she
inquired
my
love
did
you
ever
in
your
life
feel
any
pain
oh
dear
yes
grandmamma
to
be
sure
i
have
twice
why
do
you
remember
last
spring
i
had
a
dreadful
pain
in
my
head
for
nearly
two
hours
on
george
birthday
and
last
week
after
i
went
to
bed
i
had
such
a
pain
in
my
arm
i
did
not
know
how
to
bear
it
and
what
became
of
it
oh
i
found
at
last
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
i
began
to
think
what
i
should
do
i
meant
to
ring
the
bell
but
i
fell
asleep
phoebe
laughed
with
very
little
ceremony
and
grandmamma
could
not
help
joining
she
supposed
matilda
hoped
it
might
be
long
enough
before
she
had
any
more
pain
in
the
certainly
matilda
said
and
not
in
the
daytime
is
not
pain
as
bad
in
the
daytime
matilda
acknowledged
that
she
should
like
to
be
ill
in
the
daytime
mamma
took
her
on
her
lap
when
she
was
ill
and
miss
young
was
so
very
sorry
for
her
and
she
had
something
nice
to
drink
then
i
am
afraid
my
dear
you
do
pity
me
at
all
said
grandmamma
perhaps
you
think
you
would
like
to
live
in
a
room
like
this
with
a
sofa
and
a
screen
and
phoebe
to
wait
upon
you
and
whatever
you
might
fancy
to
eat
and
drink
would
you
like
to
be
ill
as
i
am
not
at
present
said
matilda
not
till
i
am
married
i
shall
enjoy
doing
as
i
like
when
i
am
married
how
the
child
head
runs
upon
being
married
said
phoebe
and
to
suppose
that
being
ill
is
doing
as
one
likes
of
all
odd
things
i
should
often
like
to
fly
all
over
the
world
said
mrs
enderby
and
to
get
anywhere
out
of
this
room
i
am
so
tired
of
it
but
i
know
i
can
not
so
i
get
books
and
read
about
all
the
strange
places
far
off
that
mungo
park
tells
us
about
and
gulliver
and
captain
parry
and
i
should
often
like
to
sleep
at
night
when
i
can
not
and
then
i
get
up
softly
without
waking
phoebe
and
look
out
at
the
bright
stars
and
think
over
all
we
are
told
about
them
about
their
being
all
full
of
men
and
women
did
you
know
that
george
asked
she
george
being
now
at
the
window
oh
yes
answered
matilda
for
him
we
know
all
about
those
things
are
falling
stars
all
full
of
men
and
women
asked
george
there
were
none
on
a
star
that
my
father
saw
fall
on
the
dingleford
road
observed
phoebe
it
was
big
enough
to
hold
men
and
women
did
it
fall
in
the
middle
of
the
road
asked
george
turning
from
the
window
what
was
it
like
it
was
a
round
thing
as
big
as
a
house
and
all
bright
and
crystal
like
said
phoebe
with
absolute
confidence
it
blocked
up
the
road
from
the
great
oak
that
you
may
remember
close
by
the
second
milestone
to
the
ditch
on
the
opposite
side
phoebe
are
you
sure
of
that
asked
mrs
enderby
with
a
face
full
of
anxious
doubt
my
father
came
straight
home
after
seeing
it
fall
and
he
let
my
brother
john
and
me
go
the
next
morning
early
to
bring
home
some
of
the
splinters
oh
well
said
mrs
enderby
who
always
preferred
believing
to
doubting
i
have
heard
of
stones
falling
from
the
moon
this
was
a
falling
star
can
you
show
me
any
of
the
splinters
asked
george
eagerly
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
left
of
them
said
phoebe
by
the
time
john
and
i
went
we
could
not
find
a
piece
of
crystal
so
big
as
my
thimble
my
father
has
often
laughed
at
john
and
me
since
for
not
having
been
there
in
time
before
it
was
all
gone
it
is
a
good
thing
my
dears
depend
upon
it
as
i
was
saying
observed
mrs
enderby
to
know
all
such
things
about
the
stars
and
so
on
against
the
time
when
you
can
not
do
as
you
like
and
go
where
you
please
matilda
my
jewel
when
you
are
married
as
you
were
talking
about
and
can
please
yourself
you
will
take
great
care
to
be
kind
to
your
mamma
my
dear
if
poor
mamma
should
be
old
and
you
will
always
wish
to
be
tender
to
your
mother
love
i
am
sure
and
that
will
do
her
more
good
than
anything
perhaps
mamma
wo
be
ill
replied
matilda
then
if
she
is
never
ill
she
will
certainly
be
old
some
day
and
then
you
will
be
as
kind
to
her
as
ever
you
can
be
promise
me
my
love
your
mamma
loves
you
dearly
matilda
she
says
i
dance
better
than
any
girl
in
miss
anderson
school
grandmamma
i
heard
her
tell
mrs
levitt
so
yesterday
here
comes
mamma
said
george
from
the
window
your
mamma
my
dear
phoebe
sweep
up
the
hearth
hang
that
curtain
straight
give
me
that
letter
no
not
that
the
large
letter
there
now
put
it
into
my
make
haste
down
phoebe
to
be
ready
to
open
the
door
for
mrs
rowland
do
keep
her
waiting
a
moment
on
the
steps
she
has
not
got
to
the
steps
yet
said
george
she
is
talking
to
mrs
grey
mrs
grey
was
coming
here
and
mamma
went
and
spoke
to
her
oh
matilda
come
and
look
how
they
are
nodding
their
bonnets
at
each
other
i
think
mrs
grey
is
very
angry
she
wags
her
head
about
so
there
now
she
is
going
away
there
she
goes
across
the
road
and
mamma
is
coming
up
the
steps
after
a
minute
or
two
of
silent
expectation
mrs
rowland
entered
her
mother
room
she
brought
with
her
a
draught
of
wintry
air
which
as
she
jerked
aside
her
ample
silk
cloak
on
taking
her
seat
on
the
sofa
seemed
to
chill
the
invalid
though
there
was
now
a
patch
of
colour
on
each
withered
cheek
how
much
better
you
look
was
the
daughter
greeting
i
always
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
disturb
philip
about
you
and
now
if
he
were
to
see
you
he
would
not
believe
that
you
had
been
mr
rowland
would
be
satisfied
that
i
am
right
i
am
sure
if
he
were
to
come
in
my
mistress
is
noways
better
said
phoebe
bluntly
she
is
not
the
better
for
that
flush
she
has
got
now
but
the
worse
never
mind
phoebe
i
shall
do
very
well
i
dare
say
said
mrs
enderby
with
a
sigh
well
my
dear
how
do
you
all
go
on
at
home
much
as
usual
but
that
reminds
me
matilda
my
own
love
miss
young
must
be
wanting
you
for
your
lesson
on
objects
go
my
dear
i
hoped
matilda
was
come
for
the
day
said
mrs
enderby
i
quite
expected
she
was
to
stay
with
me
do
let
me
have
her
my
dear
it
will
do
me
so
much
good
you
are
very
kind
but
it
is
quite
impossible
it
is
totally
out
of
the
question
i
assure
you
matilda
my
love
go
this
instant
we
make
a
great
point
of
the
lessons
on
objects
pray
phoebe
tie
miss
rowland
bonnet
and
make
haste
phoebe
did
so
taking
leave
to
observe
that
little
girls
were
likely
to
live
long
enough
to
know
plenty
of
things
after
they
had
no
grandmammas
left
to
be
a
comfort
to
mrs
enderby
struggled
to
say
hush
phoebe
but
she
found
she
could
not
speak
george
was
desired
to
go
with
his
sister
and
was
scarcely
allowed
time
to
kiss
his
grandmamma
while
phoebe
was
taking
the
children
down
stairs
mrs
rowland
wondered
that
some
people
allowed
their
servants
to
take
such
liberties
as
were
taken
and
gave
notice
that
though
she
tolerated
phoebe
because
phoebe
mistress
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
she
could
not
allow
her
family
plans
to
be
made
a
subject
of
remark
to
her
mother
domestics
mrs
enderby
had
not
quite
decided
upon
her
line
of
reply
when
phoebe
came
back
and
occupied
herself
in
supplying
her
mistress
first
with
a
footstool
and
then
with
a
cup
of
arrowroot
where
do
you
get
your
arrowroot
asked
mrs
rowland
i
want
some
extremely
for
my
poor
dear
anna
and
i
can
procure
none
that
is
at
all
to
compare
with
yours
mrs
grey
was
so
kind
as
to
send
me
some
my
dear
and
it
really
is
excellent
phoebe
how
much
of
it
is
there
left
i
dare
say
there
may
be
enough
for
a
cup
or
two
for
dear
little
anna
phoebe
replied
that
there
was
very
little
left
not
any
more
than
her
mistress
would
require
before
she
could
grow
stronger
mrs
rowland
would
not
take
the
rest
of
the
arrowroot
on
any
account
she
was
only
wondering
where
mrs
grey
got
it
and
how
it
was
that
the
greys
always
contrived
to
help
themselves
to
the
best
of
everything
phoebe
was
going
to
observe
that
they
helped
their
neighbours
to
good
things
as
well
as
themselves
but
a
look
from
her
mistress
stopped
her
mrs
enderby
remarked
that
she
had
no
doubt
she
could
learn
from
mrs
grey
or
sophia
the
next
time
she
saw
either
of
them
where
they
procured
their
arrowroot
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
saw
mrs
grey
she
observed
timidly
my
dear
how
can
you
think
of
seeing
any
one
in
your
present
state
inquired
the
daughter
one
need
but
see
the
flush
in
your
face
to
know
that
it
would
be
highly
improper
for
you
to
admit
company
i
could
not
take
the
responsibility
of
allowing
it
but
mrs
grey
is
not
company
my
love
any
one
is
company
to
an
invalid
i
assure
you
i
prevented
mr
rowland
coming
for
the
reason
i
assign
he
was
coming
yesterday
but
i
would
not
let
him
i
should
like
to
see
him
however
and
i
should
like
to
see
mrs
grey
too
under
pretence
of
arranging
her
mistress
shawl
phoebe
touched
the
old
lady
shoulder
in
token
of
intelligence
mrs
enderby
was
somewhat
flurried
at
the
liberty
which
she
felt
her
maid
had
taken
with
her
daughter
but
she
could
not
notice
it
now
and
she
introduced
another
subject
had
everybody
done
calling
on
the
hopes
were
the
wedding
visits
all
over
oh
yes
mrs
rowland
was
thankful
to
say
that
fuss
was
at
an
end
at
last
one
would
think
nobody
had
ever
been
married
before
by
the
noise
that
had
been
made
in
deerbrook
about
this
young
couple
mr
hope
is
such
a
favourite
observed
mrs
enderby
he
has
been
so
but
it
wo
last
i
never
saw
a
young
man
so
gone
off
as
he
is
he
has
not
been
like
the
same
man
since
he
connected
himself
with
the
greys
so
decidedly
surely
you
must
perceive
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
my
dear
he
comes
very
often
and
he
is
always
extremely
kind
and
very
entertaining
he
brought
his
bride
with
him
yesterday
which
i
thought
very
attentive
as
i
could
not
go
and
pay
my
respects
to
her
and
really
priscilla
whether
it
was
that
i
had
not
seen
her
for
some
time
or
that
pretty
young
ladies
look
prettiest
in
an
old
woman
i
thought
she
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
is
handsome
admitted
mrs
rowland
poor
thing
it
makes
one
sorry
for
her
when
one
thinks
what
is
before
her
what
is
before
her
ask
mrs
enderby
alarmed
if
she
loves
her
husband
at
all
she
must
suffer
cruelly
in
seeing
him
act
as
he
persists
in
doing
and
she
must
tremble
in
looking
forward
to
the
consequences
he
is
quite
obstinate
about
voting
for
mr
lowry
though
there
is
not
a
soul
in
deerbrook
to
keep
him
in
countenance
and
everybody
knows
how
strongly
sir
william
hunter
has
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
mr
ballinger
it
is
thought
the
consequences
will
be
very
serious
to
mr
hope
there
is
his
almshouse
practice
at
stake
at
all
events
and
i
fancy
a
good
many
families
will
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
if
he
defies
the
hunters
and
goes
against
the
opinions
of
all
his
neighbours
his
wife
must
see
that
he
has
nobody
with
him
i
do
pity
the
poor
young
thing
dear
me
said
the
old
lady
can
nothing
be
done
i
wonder
i
declare
i
am
quite
concerned
i
should
hope
something
may
be
done
i
would
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
to
him
myself
rather
than
that
any
harm
should
happen
to
him
he
has
always
been
so
very
kind
to
me
that
i
think
i
could
venture
to
say
anything
to
him
i
will
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
and
see
what
can
be
done
you
will
not
prevail
with
him
i
am
afraid
if
mr
grey
speaks
in
vain
as
i
know
he
has
done
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
else
will
have
any
influence
over
him
no
no
the
wilful
must
be
left
to
their
own
devices
whatever
you
do
do
not
speak
to
the
bride
about
it
or
there
is
no
knowing
what
you
may
bring
upon
yourself
what
could
i
bring
upon
myself
my
dear
oh
those
who
do
not
see
the
vixen
in
that
pretty
face
of
hers
have
not
such
good
eyes
as
she
has
herself
for
god
sake
do
not
offend
her
mrs
enderby
was
now
full
of
concern
and
being
as
unhappy
as
she
could
be
made
for
the
present
her
daughter
took
her
leave
the
old
lady
looked
into
the
fire
and
sighed
for
some
minutes
after
she
was
left
alone
when
phoebe
her
mistress
declared
that
she
felt
quite
tired
out
and
must
lie
down
before
she
closed
her
eyes
she
raised
her
head
again
and
said
phoebe
i
am
surprised
at
you
oh
you
mean
about
my
taking
the
liberty
to
make
a
sign
to
you
but
i
trust
you
will
excuse
it
because
i
am
sure
mr
hope
would
have
no
objection
to
your
seeing
mrs
grey
and
to
my
thought
there
is
no
occasion
to
consult
with
anybody
else
and
i
have
no
doubt
mrs
grey
will
be
calling
again
some
day
soon
just
at
a
time
when
you
are
fit
to
see
her
is
not
there
any
book
or
anything
that
i
could
be
carrying
over
to
mrs
grey
while
you
are
resting
yourself
ah
do
so
phoebe
carry
that
book
it
is
not
quite
due
but
that
does
not
signify
carry
that
book
over
and
give
my
regards
and
beg
to
know
how
mrs
grey
and
all
the
family
are
and
if
mrs
grey
come
in
this
evening
she
continued
in
excuse
to
herself
for
her
devices
i
shall
be
able
to
find
out
in
a
quiet
way
where
she
gets
her
arrowroot
and
priscilla
will
be
glad
to
know
whatever
it
might
be
that
phoebe
said
to
alice
and
that
brought
mrs
grey
out
into
the
hall
to
speak
herself
to
phoebe
the
result
was
that
mrs
grey
lantern
was
ordered
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
and
that
she
arrived
in
mrs
enderby
apartment
just
as
the
old
lady
had
waked
from
her
doze
and
while
the
few
tears
that
had
escaped
from
under
her
eyelids
before
she
slept
were
yet
scarcely
dried
upon
her
cheeks
chapter
nineteen
home
at
the
hopes
the
evil
consequences
of
mr
hope
voting
for
lowry
had
not
been
exaggerated
in
the
anticipations
of
his
friends
and
vigilant
neighbours
and
these
consequences
were
rather
aggravated
than
alleviated
by
the
circumstance
that
mr
lowry
won
the
election
first
the
inhabitants
of
deerbrook
were
on
the
watch
for
any
words
which
might
fall
from
sir
william
or
lady
hunter
and
when
it
was
reported
that
sir
william
had
frowned
and
sworn
an
oath
at
mr
hope
on
hearing
how
he
had
voted
and
that
lady
hunter
had
asked
whether
it
was
possible
that
mr
hope
had
forgotten
under
whose
interest
he
held
his
appointment
to
attend
the
almshouses
and
the
neighbouring
hamlet
several
persons
determined
to
be
beforehand
with
their
great
neighbours
and
to
give
the
benefit
of
their
family
practice
to
some
one
of
better
politics
than
mr
hope
in
another
set
of
minds
a
real
fear
of
mr
hope
as
a
dangerous
person
sprang
up
under
the
heat
of
the
displeasure
of
the
influential
members
of
society
such
were
slow
to
have
recourse
to
another
medical
attendant
and
undertook
the
management
of
the
health
of
their
own
families
till
they
could
find
an
adviser
in
whom
they
could
perfectly
confide
when
mr
lowry
gained
the
contest
the
population
of
deerbrook
was
electrified
and
the
unpleasantness
of
their
surprise
was
visited
upon
the
only
supporter
of
mr
lowry
whom
the
place
contained
wise
folks
were
not
wanting
who
talked
of
the
skill
which
some
persons
had
in
keeping
on
the
winning
side
of
reasons
which
time
sometimes
revealed
for
persons
choosing
to
be
singular
and
some
remarkable
incidents
were
reported
of
conversations
between
mr
lowry
and
mr
hope
in
the
lanes
and
of
certain
wonderful
advantages
which
had
lately
fallen
to
one
or
another
of
mr
hope
acquaintances
through
some
strong
political
interest
mr
rowland
doubted
at
his
own
table
all
the
news
he
heard
on
the
subject
and
said
everywhere
that
he
did
not
see
why
a
man
should
not
vote
as
he
pleased
mr
grey
was
very
sorry
about
the
whole
affair
he
was
sorry
that
there
had
been
any
contest
at
all
for
the
county
as
it
disturbed
the
peace
of
deerbrook
he
was
sorry
that
the
candidate
he
preferred
had
won
as
the
fact
exasperated
the
temper
of
deerbrook
he
was
sorry
that
hope
had
voted
to
the
detriment
of
his
name
and
rising
fortunes
and
he
was
sorry
that
he
himself
had
been
unable
at
last
to
vote
for
lowry
to
keep
his
young
friend
in
countenance
it
was
truly
unlucky
that
he
should
have
passed
his
promise
early
to
sir
william
hunter
not
to
vote
it
was
a
sad
business
altogether
it
was
only
to
be
hoped
that
it
would
pass
out
of
people
minds
that
things
would
soon
get
into
their
usual
train
and
that
it
might
be
seven
years
before
there
was
another
election
hester
complained
to
her
husband
and
sister
of
the
manner
in
which
she
was
treated
by
the
tradespeople
of
the
place
she
had
desired
to
put
herself
on
a
footing
of
acquaintanceship
with
them
as
neighbours
and
persons
with
whom
there
must
be
a
constant
transaction
of
business
for
life
she
saw
at
once
the
difference
in
the
relation
between
tradespeople
and
their
customers
in
a
large
town
like
birmingham
and
in
a
village
where
there
is
but
one
baker
where
the
grocer
and
hatter
are
the
same
personage
and
where
you
can
not
fly
from
your
butcher
be
he
ever
so
much
your
foe
hester
therefore
made
it
her
business
to
transact
herself
all
affairs
with
the
village
tradesmen
she
began
her
housekeeping
energetically
and
might
be
seen
in
mr
jones
open
shop
in
the
coldest
morning
of
january
selecting
her
joint
of
meat
or
deciding
among
brown
sugars
at
tucker
the
grocer
after
the
election
she
found
some
difference
in
the
manner
of
most
of
the
towards
her
and
she
fancied
more
than
there
was
with
some
of
these
persons
there
was
no
more
in
their
minds
than
the
consciousness
of
having
discussed
the
new
family
and
mr
hope
vote
and
come
to
a
conclusion
against
his
principles
with
others
mrs
rowland
influence
had
done
deeper
mischief
a
few
words
dropped
by
herself
or
reports
of
her
sayings
circulated
by
her
servants
occasioned
dislike
or
alarm
which
hester
sensitiveness
apprehended
at
once
and
forthwith
exaggerated
she
complained
to
her
husband
that
she
could
not
go
to
the
shops
with
any
comfort
and
that
she
thought
she
must
turn
over
the
housekeeping
to
morris
margaret
remonstrated
against
this
and
by
being
her
sister
constant
companion
in
her
walks
of
business
as
well
as
pleasure
hoped
to
be
able
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
preserve
or
restore
if
need
were
a
good
understanding
between
parties
who
could
most
materially
promote
or
injure
each
comfort
the
leisure
hours
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
such
transport
were
all
chequered
with
anxiety
on
this
subject
in
the
intervals
of
speculation
on
another
matter
to
which
she
found
her
mind
constantly
recurring
in
spite
of
her
conviction
that
it
was
no
concern
of
hers
where
mr
enderby
was
what
he
was
doing
and
when
he
would
come
day
by
day
as
she
spread
her
books
before
her
or
began
to
write
she
wondered
at
her
own
listlessness
about
employments
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
so
much
eagerness
and
when
she
detected
herself
gazing
into
the
fire
by
the
together
or
allowing
the
ink
to
dry
in
her
suspended
pen
she
found
that
she
was
as
far
as
ever
from
deciding
whether
hester
was
not
now
in
the
way
to
be
less
happy
than
ever
and
how
it
was
that
with
all
her
close
friendship
with
philip
enderby
of
which
she
had
spoken
so
confidently
to
maria
she
was
now
in
perfect
ignorance
of
his
movements
and
intentions
the
whole
was
very
strange
and
in
the
experience
somewhat
dreary
her
great
comfort
was
edward
this
was
a
new
support
and
a
strong
one
but
even
here
she
was
compelled
to
own
herself
somewhat
disappointed
this
brotherly
relation
for
which
she
had
longed
all
her
life
did
not
bring
the
fulness
of
satisfaction
which
she
had
anticipated
she
had
not
a
fault
to
find
with
edward
she
was
always
called
upon
by
his
daily
conduct
for
admiration
esteem
and
affection
but
all
this
was
not
of
the
profit
to
her
which
she
had
expected
he
seemed
altered
the
flow
of
his
spirits
was
much
moderated
but
perhaps
this
was
no
loss
as
his
calmness
his
gentle
seriousness
and
domestic
benevolence
were
brought
out
more
strikingly
than
ever
margaret
disappointment
lay
in
the
intercourse
between
themselves
that
edward
was
reserved
that
beneath
his
remarkable
frankness
there
lay
an
uncommunicativeness
of
disposition
no
one
could
before
his
marriage
have
made
her
believe
yet
it
certainly
was
so
though
hester
and
she
never
discussed
character
more
or
less
though
hester
love
for
him
and
respect
for
that
love
rendered
all
such
conversation
unpossible
margaret
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
hester
conviction
on
this
particular
point
was
the
same
as
her
own
that
hester
had
discovered
that
she
had
not
fully
understood
her
husband
and
that
there
remained
a
region
of
his
character
into
which
she
had
not
yet
penetrated
margaret
was
obliged
to
conclude
that
all
this
was
natural
and
right
and
that
what
she
had
heard
said
of
men
generally
was
true
even
of
edward
hope
that
there
are
depths
of
character
where
there
are
not
regions
of
experience
which
defy
the
sympathy
and
sagacity
of
women
however
natural
and
right
all
this
might
be
she
could
not
but
be
sorry
for
it
it
brought
disappointment
to
herself
and
as
she
sadly
suspected
to
hester
while
continually
and
delightedly
compelled
to
honour
and
regard
him
more
and
more
and
to
rely
upon
him
as
she
had
never
before
relied
she
felt
that
he
did
not
win
and
even
did
not
desire
any
intimate
confidence
she
found
that
she
could
still
say
things
to
maria
which
she
could
not
say
to
him
and
that
while
their
domestic
conversation
rarely
flagged
while
it
embraced
a
boundless
range
of
fact
and
all
that
they
could
ascertain
of
morals
philosophy
and
religion
the
greatest
psychological
events
the
most
interesting
experiences
of
her
life
might
go
forward
without
express
recognition
from
edward
such
was
her
view
of
the
case
and
this
was
the
disappointment
which
in
the
early
days
of
her
new
mode
of
life
she
had
to
acknowledge
to
herself
and
to
conceal
from
all
others
one
fine
bright
morning
towards
the
end
of
january
the
sisters
set
out
for
their
walk
willingly
quitting
the
clear
crackling
fire
within
for
the
sharp
air
and
sparkling
pathways
without
which
way
shall
we
go
asked
margaret
oh
i
suppose
along
the
as
usual
how
provoking
it
is
that
we
are
prevented
day
after
day
from
getting
to
the
woods
by
my
not
having
arrived
we
will
go
by
mrs
howell
for
the
chance
of
their
having
come
mrs
howell
had
two
expressions
of
countenance
the
gracious
and
the
prim
till
lately
hester
had
been
favoured
with
the
first
exclusively
she
was
now
to
be
amused
with
variety
and
the
prim
was
offered
to
her
contemplation
never
did
mrs
howell
look
more
inaccessible
than
when
she
scarcely
rose
from
her
stool
behind
the
counter
to
learn
what
was
the
errand
of
her
customer
you
guess
what
i
am
come
for
mrs
howell
i
dare
say
have
my
boots
arrived
yet
i
am
not
aware
of
their
having
arrived
but
miss
miskin
is
now
occupied
in
that
department
only
consider
how
the
winter
is
getting
on
mrs
howell
and
i
can
walk
nowhere
but
in
the
for
want
of
my
boot
mrs
howell
curtsied
can
you
not
hasten
your
agent
or
help
me
to
my
boots
one
way
or
another
is
there
no
one
in
deerbrook
whom
you
could
employ
to
make
me
a
pair
mrs
howell
cast
up
her
hands
and
eyes
how
do
other
ladies
manage
to
obtain
their
boots
before
the
snow
comes
instead
of
after
it
has
melted
perhaps
you
will
ask
them
yourself
i
conceive
you
know
all
the
ladies
in
deerbrook
you
will
find
miss
miskin
in
that
department
ladies
if
you
wish
to
investigate
hester
invaded
the
domain
of
miss
miskin
the
behind
the
other
counter
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
to
put
on
her
feet
which
should
enable
her
to
walk
where
she
pleased
while
engaged
in
turning
over
the
stock
without
any
help
from
miss
miskin
who
was
imitating
mrs
howell
distant
manner
with
considerable
success
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
which
could
be
no
other
than
sir
william
hunter
and
lady
hunter
voice
was
accordingly
heard
the
next
minute
asking
for
green
the
gentle
drawl
of
mrs
howell
tone
conveyed
that
her
countenance
had
resumed
its
primary
expression
she
observed
upon
the
horrors
of
the
fire
which
had
happened
at
blickley
the
night
before
lady
hunter
had
not
heard
of
it
and
the
relation
therefore
followed
of
the
burning
down
of
a
house
and
shop
in
blickley
when
a
nursemaid
and
baby
were
lost
in
the
flames
i
should
hope
it
is
not
true
observed
lady
hunter
last
night
did
you
say
early
this
morning
there
has
scarcely
been
time
for
the
news
to
arrive
of
a
fire
at
blickley
early
this
morning
it
is
certainly
true
however
my
lady
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
catastrophe
i
am
grieved
to
say
and
mrs
howell
sighs
were
sympathetically
responded
to
by
miss
miskin
in
the
back
shop
but
how
did
you
hear
it
asked
lady
hunter
there
was
no
audible
answer
there
were
probably
signs
and
intimations
of
something
for
lady
hunter
made
a
circuit
round
the
shop
on
some
pretence
and
stared
in
at
the
door
of
the
just
at
the
right
moment
for
perceiving
if
she
so
pleased
the
beautiful
smallness
of
hester
foot
some
low
murmuring
conversation
then
passed
at
mrs
howell
counter
when
the
words
black
servant
alone
met
ear
hester
found
nothing
that
she
could
wear
the
more
she
pressed
for
information
and
assistance
about
obtaining
boots
the
more
provokingly
cool
miss
miskin
grew
at
last
hester
turned
to
her
sister
with
a
hasty
inquiry
what
was
to
be
done
we
must
hope
for
better
fortune
before
next
winter
i
suppose
said
margaret
smiling
and
wet
my
feet
every
day
this
winter
said
hester
for
i
will
not
be
confined
to
the
for
any
such
reason
as
this
dear
me
you
are
warm
simpered
miss
miskin
i
warm
what
do
you
mean
miss
miskin
you
are
warm
not
that
it
is
of
any
consequence
but
you
are
a
little
warm
at
present
nobody
can
charge
that
upon
you
miss
miskin
i
must
say
observed
margaret
laughing
no
that
they
can
not
nor
ever
will
i
am
not
apt
to
be
warm
and
i
hope
i
can
excuse
good
morning
ladies
mrs
howell
treated
her
customers
with
a
swimming
curtsey
as
they
went
out
glancing
at
her
the
while
lady
hunter
favoured
them
with
a
full
stare
what
excessive
impertinence
exclaimed
hester
to
tell
me
that
i
was
warm
and
she
hoped
she
could
excuse
my
husband
will
hardly
believe
it
oh
yes
he
will
he
knows
them
for
two
ignorant
silly
women
worth
observing
perhaps
but
not
worth
minding
have
you
any
other
shop
to
go
to
yes
the
tinman
for
a
saucepan
or
two
of
a
size
not
yet
supplied
for
which
morris
had
petitioned
the
tinman
was
either
unable
or
not
very
anxious
to
understand
requisitions
he
brought
out
everything
but
what
was
wanted
and
was
so
extremely
interested
in
observing
something
that
was
going
on
over
the
way
that
he
was
every
moment
casting
glances
abroad
between
the
and
fenders
that
his
window
the
ladies
at
last
looked
over
the
way
too
and
saw
a
gig
containing
a
black
footman
standing
before
the
opposite
house
a
stranger
in
deerbrook
observed
margaret
as
they
issued
from
the
shop
i
do
not
wonder
that
mr
hill
had
so
little
attention
to
spare
for
us
the
sisters
had
been
so
accustomed
during
all
the
years
of
their
birmingham
life
to
see
faces
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
could
not
yet
sympathise
with
the
emotions
caused
in
deerbrook
by
the
appearance
of
a
stranger
they
walked
on
forgetting
in
conversation
all
about
the
gig
and
black
servant
hester
had
not
been
pleased
by
the
insufficient
attention
she
had
met
with
in
both
the
shops
she
had
visited
and
she
did
not
enjoy
her
walk
as
was
her
wont
as
they
trod
the
crisp
and
glittering
snow
margaret
hoped
the
little
rowlands
and
greys
were
happy
in
making
the
which
had
been
the
vision
of
their
imaginations
since
the
winter
set
in
but
hester
cast
longing
eyes
on
the
dark
woods
which
sprang
from
the
sheeted
meadows
and
thought
nothing
could
be
so
delightful
as
to
wander
among
them
and
gather
icicles
from
the
boughs
even
though
the
paths
should
be
in
snow
just
when
they
were
proposing
to
turn
back
a
horseman
appeared
on
the
ridge
of
the
rising
ground
over
which
the
road
passed
it
is
edward
cried
hester
i
had
no
idea
we
should
meet
him
on
this
road
and
she
quickened
her
pace
and
her
countenance
brightened
as
if
she
had
not
seen
him
for
a
month
before
they
met
him
however
the
gig
with
the
black
footman
now
containing
also
a
gentleman
driving
overtook
and
slowly
passed
them
the
gentleman
looking
round
him
as
if
in
search
of
some
dwelling
hereabouts
on
approaching
hope
the
stranger
drew
up
touched
his
hat
and
asked
a
question
and
on
receiving
the
answer
bowed
turned
round
and
repassed
hester
and
margaret
hope
joined
his
wife
and
sister
and
walked
his
horse
beside
the
path
who
is
that
gentleman
edward
i
believe
it
is
mr
foster
the
surgeon
at
blickley
what
did
he
want
with
you
he
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
in
the
right
road
to
the
russell
taylors
the
russell
taylors
your
patients
once
my
patients
but
no
longer
so
it
seems
they
are
mr
patients
now
hester
made
no
reply
can
you
see
from
your
pathway
what
is
going
on
below
there
in
the
meadow
i
see
the
skaters
very
busy
on
the
ponds
why
do
not
you
go
there
instead
of
walking
here
every
day
margaret
had
to
explain
the
case
about
the
for
hester
face
was
bathed
in
tears
edward
rallied
her
gently
but
it
would
not
do
she
motioned
to
him
to
ride
on
and
he
thought
it
best
to
do
so
the
sisters
proceeded
in
silence
hester
tears
flowing
faster
and
faster
instead
of
walking
through
deerbrook
she
took
a
back
road
homewards
and
drew
down
her
veil
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
however
they
met
sophia
grey
and
her
sisters
and
sophia
would
stop
she
was
about
to
turn
back
with
them
when
she
saw
that
something
was
the
matter
and
then
she
checked
herself
awkwardly
and
wished
her
cousins
good
morning
while
fanny
and
mary
were
staring
at
hester
one
ought
not
to
mind
said
margaret
half
laughing
there
are
so
many
causes
for
grown
people
tears
but
i
always
feel
now
as
i
did
when
i
was
a
child
a
shame
at
being
seen
in
tears
and
an
excessive
desire
to
tell
people
that
i
have
not
been
naughty
you
could
not
have
told
sophia
so
of
me
i
am
sure
said
hester
yes
i
could
you
are
not
crying
because
you
have
been
naughty
but
you
are
naughty
because
you
cry
and
that
may
be
cured
presently
it
was
not
presently
cured
however
during
the
whole
of
hester
tears
continued
to
flow
and
she
could
not
eat
though
she
made
efforts
to
do
so
edward
and
margaret
talked
a
great
deal
about
skating
and
and
about
the
fire
at
blickley
but
they
came
to
a
stand
at
last
the
went
about
on
tiptoe
and
shut
the
door
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
and
this
made
hester
short
sobs
only
the
more
audible
it
was
a
relief
when
the
oranges
were
on
the
table
at
last
and
the
door
closed
behind
the
dinner
and
the
boy
margaret
began
to
peel
an
orange
for
her
sister
and
edward
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
he
placed
it
before
her
and
then
drew
his
chair
to
her
side
saying
now
my
dear
let
us
get
to
the
bottom
of
all
this
distress
no
do
not
try
edward
never
mind
me
i
shall
get
the
better
of
this
only
let
me
alone
thank
you
said
hope
smiling
i
like
to
see
people
reasonable
i
am
to
see
you
sorrowing
in
this
way
and
for
very
sufficient
cause
and
i
am
neither
to
mind
your
troubles
nor
my
own
but
to
be
as
merry
as
if
nothing
had
happened
is
not
this
reasonable
margaret
for
very
sufficient
cause
said
hester
eagerly
yes
indeed
for
very
sufficient
cause
it
must
be
a
painful
thing
to
you
to
find
my
neighbours
beginning
to
dislike
me
to
have
the
tradespeople
impertinent
to
you
on
my
account
to
see
my
patients
leave
me
and
call
in
somebody
from
a
distance
in
the
face
of
all
deerbrook
it
must
make
you
anxious
to
think
what
is
to
become
of
us
if
the
discontent
continues
and
spreads
and
it
must
be
a
bitter
disappointment
to
you
to
find
that
to
be
my
wife
is
not
to
be
so
happy
as
we
expected
here
is
cause
enough
for
tears
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
hester
looked
up
at
her
husband
with
an
expression
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
which
consoled
him
for
her
i
will
not
answer
for
it
he
continued
but
that
we
may
all
three
sit
down
to
weep
together
one
of
these
days
and
then
said
margaret
hester
will
be
the
first
to
cheer
up
and
comfort
us
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
replied
hope
meantime
is
there
anything
that
you
would
have
had
done
otherwise
by
me
was
i
right
or
not
to
vote
and
was
there
anything
wrong
in
my
manner
of
doing
it
is
there
any
cause
whatever
for
repentance
none
none
cried
hester
you
have
been
right
throughout
i
glory
in
all
you
do
to
me
it
seems
that
you
could
not
have
done
otherwise
observed
margaret
it
was
a
simple
unavoidable
act
done
with
the
simplicity
of
affairs
which
happen
in
natural
course
i
neither
repent
it
for
you
nor
glory
in
it
that
is
just
my
view
of
it
margaret
and
it
follows
that
the
consequences
are
to
be
taken
as
coming
in
natural
course
too
does
not
this
again
simplify
the
affair
hester
it
lights
it
up
replied
hester
it
reminds
me
how
all
would
have
been
if
you
had
acted
otherwise
than
as
you
did
it
is
to
be
sure
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
of
such
a
thing
but
if
you
had
not
voted
i
should
have
not
despised
you
in
any
degree
but
lost
confidence
in
you
a
little
that
is
a
very
mild
way
of
putting
it
said
hope
laughing
thank
heaven
we
are
spared
that
exclaimed
margaret
but
brother
tell
us
the
worst
that
you
think
can
come
of
this
displeasure
against
you
i
rather
suspect
however
that
we
have
suffered
the
worst
already
in
discovering
that
people
can
be
displeased
with
you
that
being
so
extremely
rare
a
lot
in
this
world
and
especially
in
the
world
of
a
village
replied
hope
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
expect
as
the
last
result
of
this
affair
nor
am
i
anxious
to
foresee
i
never
liked
the
sort
of
attachment
that
most
of
my
neighbours
have
testified
for
me
it
was
to
their
honour
in
as
far
as
it
showed
kindness
of
heart
but
it
was
unreasonable
so
unreasonable
that
i
imagine
the
opposite
feelings
which
are
now
succeeding
may
be
just
as
much
in
excess
suppose
it
should
be
so
hester
well
what
then
she
asked
sighing
suppose
our
neighbours
should
send
me
to
coventry
and
my
patients
should
leave
me
so
far
as
that
we
should
not
have
enough
to
live
on
that
would
be
persecution
cried
hester
brightening
i
could
bear
persecution
downright
persecution
you
could
bear
seeing
your
husband
torn
by
lions
in
the
amphitheatre
said
margaret
smiling
but
but
a
toss
of
mrs
howell
head
is
unendurable
said
hope
with
solemnity
hester
looked
down
blushing
like
a
chidden
child
but
about
this
persecution
said
she
what
made
you
ask
those
questions
just
now
i
find
my
neighbours
more
angry
with
me
than
i
could
have
supposed
possible
my
dear
i
have
been
treated
with
great
and
growing
rudeness
for
some
days
in
a
place
like
this
you
know
offences
seldom
come
alone
if
you
do
a
thing
which
a
village
public
does
not
approve
there
will
be
offence
in
whatever
else
you
say
and
do
for
some
time
after
and
i
suspect
that
is
my
case
now
i
may
be
mistaken
however
and
whatever
happens
i
hope
my
love
we
shall
all
be
to
the
last
degree
careful
not
to
see
offence
where
it
is
not
intended
not
to
do
the
very
thing
we
are
suffering
under
ourselves
observed
margaret
we
will
not
watch
our
neighbours
and
canvass
their
opinions
of
us
by
our
own
fireside
said
hope
we
will
conclude
them
all
to
be
our
friends
till
they
give
us
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary
shall
it
not
be
so
love
i
know
what
you
mean
said
hester
with
some
resentment
in
her
voice
and
manner
you
can
not
trust
my
temper
in
your
affairs
and
you
are
perfectly
right
my
temper
is
not
to
be
trusted
very
few
are
in
the
first
agonies
of
unpopularity
and
such
faith
in
one
neighbours
as
shall
supersede
watching
them
ought
hardly
to
be
looked
for
in
the
atmosphere
of
deerbrook
we
must
all
look
to
ourselves
i
understand
you
said
hester
i
take
the
lesson
home
i
assure
you
it
is
clear
to
me
through
your
cautious
phrase
the
and
of
us
and
but
remember
this
that
people
are
not
made
alike
and
are
not
able
and
not
intended
to
feel
alike
and
if
some
have
less
power
than
others
over
their
sorrow
at
least
over
their
tears
it
does
not
follow
that
they
can
not
bear
as
well
what
they
have
to
bear
if
i
can
not
sit
looking
as
margaret
does
peeling
oranges
and
philosophising
it
may
not
be
that
i
have
less
strength
at
my
heart
but
that
i
have
more
at
stake
more
hope
started
from
her
side
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
at
this
moment
the
boy
entered
with
a
message
from
a
patient
in
the
next
street
who
wanted
mr
hope
oh
do
not
leave
me
edward
do
not
leave
me
at
this
moment
cried
hester
come
back
for
five
minutes
hope
quietly
said
that
he
should
return
presently
and
went
out
when
the
hall
door
was
heard
to
close
behind
him
hester
flung
herself
down
on
the
sofa
whatever
momentary
resentment
margaret
might
have
felt
at
her
sister
words
it
vanished
at
the
sight
of
hester
attitude
of
wretchedness
she
sat
on
a
footstool
beside
the
sofa
and
took
her
sister
hand
in
hers
you
are
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
murmured
hester
but
margaret
mind
what
i
say
never
marry
margaret
never
love
and
never
marry
margaret
margaret
laid
her
hand
on
her
sister
shoulder
saying
stop
here
hester
while
i
was
the
only
friend
you
had
it
was
right
and
kind
to
tell
me
all
that
was
in
your
heart
but
now
that
there
is
one
nearer
and
dearer
and
far
far
worthier
than
i
i
can
hear
nothing
like
this
nor
are
you
fit
just
now
to
speak
of
these
serious
things
you
are
discomposed
one
would
think
you
were
echoing
miss
miskin
margaret
are
warm
but
you
must
hear
this
much
i
insist
upon
it
if
you
would
have
heard
me
you
would
have
found
that
i
was
not
going
to
say
a
word
about
my
husband
inconsistent
with
all
the
love
and
honour
you
would
have
him
enjoy
i
assure
you
you
might
trust
me
not
to
complain
of
my
husband
i
have
no
words
in
which
to
say
how
noble
he
is
but
oh
it
is
all
true
about
the
wretchedness
of
married
life
i
am
wretched
margaret
so
i
see
said
margaret
in
deep
sorrow
life
is
a
blank
to
me
i
have
no
hope
left
i
am
neither
wiser
nor
better
nor
happier
for
god
having
given
me
all
that
should
make
a
woman
what
i
meant
to
be
what
can
god
give
me
more
than
i
have
i
was
just
thinking
so
replied
margaret
mournfully
what
follows
then
not
that
all
married
people
are
unhappy
because
you
are
yes
oh
yes
all
who
are
capable
of
happiness
all
who
can
love
the
truth
is
there
is
no
perfect
confidence
in
the
world
there
is
no
rest
for
one
heart
i
believed
there
was
and
i
am
disappointed
and
if
you
believe
there
is
you
will
be
disappointed
too
i
warn
you
i
shall
not
neglect
your
warning
but
i
do
believe
there
is
rest
for
rational
affections
i
am
confident
there
is
if
the
primary
condition
is
fulfilled
if
there
is
repose
in
god
together
with
human
love
you
think
that
trust
in
god
is
wanting
in
me
do
let
us
speak
of
something
else
said
margaret
we
are
wrong
to
think
and
talk
of
ourselves
as
we
do
there
is
something
sickly
about
our
state
while
we
do
so
and
we
deserve
to
be
suffering
as
we
are
come
let
us
be
up
and
doing
let
me
read
to
you
or
will
you
practise
with
me
till
edward
comes
back
not
till
you
have
answered
my
question
margaret
do
you
believe
that
my
wretchedness
is
from
want
of
trust
in
god
i
believe
said
margaret
seriously
that
all
restless
and
passionate
suffering
is
from
that
cause
and
now
hester
no
more
hester
allowed
margaret
to
read
to
her
but
it
would
not
do
she
was
too
highly
wrought
up
for
common
interests
the
reading
was
broken
off
by
her
hysterical
sobs
and
it
was
clear
that
the
best
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
her
to
bed
under
morris
care
that
all
agitating
conversation
might
be
avoided
when
mr
hope
returned
he
found
margaret
sitting
alone
at
the
if
she
had
had
no
greater
power
of
than
her
sister
edward
might
have
been
made
wretched
enough
for
her
heart
was
full
of
dismay
but
she
felt
the
importance
of
the
duty
of
supporting
him
and
he
found
her
though
serious
apparently
cheerful
i
have
sent
hester
to
bed
said
she
as
he
entered
she
was
worn
out
yes
just
go
and
speak
to
her
but
do
not
give
her
the
opportunity
of
any
more
conversation
till
she
has
slept
tell
her
that
i
am
going
to
send
her
some
tea
and
by
that
time
yours
will
be
ready
just
one
word
upon
the
events
of
said
hope
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
after
having
reported
that
hester
was
tolerably
composed
just
one
word
and
no
more
we
must
avoid
bringing
emotions
to
a
point
giving
occasion
for
i
entirely
agree
with
you
said
margaret
she
requires
to
be
drawn
out
of
herself
she
can
not
bear
that
opening
of
the
sluices
which
is
a
benefit
and
comfort
to
some
people
let
us
keep
them
shut
and
when
it
comes
to
acting
see
how
she
will
act
bless
you
for
that
was
on
hope
lips
but
he
did
not
say
it
tea
was
soon
dismissed
and
he
then
took
up
the
newspaper
and
when
that
was
finished
he
found
he
could
not
read
to
margaret
he
must
write
he
had
a
case
to
report
for
a
medical
journal
i
hope
i
have
not
spoiled
your
evening
said
hester
languidly
when
her
sister
went
to
bid
her
i
have
been
listening
but
i
could
not
hear
you
either
laughing
or
talking
because
we
have
been
neither
laughing
nor
talking
my
brother
has
been
writing
writing
to
whom
to
emily
or
to
anne
to
a
far
more
redoubtable
person
than
either
to
the
editor
of
some
one
of
those
green
and
blue
periodicals
that
he
devours
as
if
they
were
poetry
and
i
have
been
copying
music
how
tired
you
look
well
then
margaret
might
well
look
tired
but
she
did
not
go
to
rest
for
long
how
should
she
rest
while
her
soul
was
sick
with
dismay
her
heart
weighed
down
with
disappointment
her
sister
sobs
still
sounding
in
her
ear
her
sister
agonised
countenance
rising
up
from
moment
to
moment
as
often
as
she
closed
her
eyes
and
all
this
within
the
sacred
enclosure
of
home
in
the
very
sanctuary
of
peace
all
this
where
love
had
guided
the
suffering
one
to
marriage
where
there
was
present
neither
sickness
nor
calamity
nor
guilt
but
the
very
opposites
of
all
these
could
it
then
be
true
that
the
only
sanctuary
of
peace
is
in
the
heart
that
while
love
is
the
master
passion
of
humanity
the
of
human
action
the
crowning
interest
of
human
life
while
it
is
ordained
natural
inevitable
it
should
issue
as
if
it
were
discountenanced
by
providence
unnatural
and
to
be
repelled
could
it
be
so
was
hester
warning
against
love
against
marriage
reasonable
and
to
be
regarded
that
warning
margaret
thought
she
could
never
put
aside
so
heavily
had
it
sunk
upon
her
heart
crushing
she
knew
not
what
there
if
it
was
not
a
reasonable
warning
whither
should
she
turn
for
consolation
for
hester
if
this
misery
arose
out
of
an
incapacity
in
hester
herself
for
happiness
in
domestic
life
then
farewell
sisterly
comfort
farewell
all
the
bright
visions
she
had
ever
indulged
on
behalf
of
the
one
who
had
always
been
her
nearest
and
dearest
instead
of
these
there
must
be
struggle
and
grief
far
deeper
than
in
the
anxious
years
that
were
gone
struggle
with
an
evil
which
must
grow
if
it
does
not
diminish
and
grief
for
an
added
sufferer
for
one
who
deserved
blessing
where
he
was
destined
to
receive
torture
this
was
not
the
first
time
by
a
hundred
that
hester
had
kept
margaret
from
her
pillow
and
then
driven
rest
from
it
but
never
had
the
trial
been
so
great
as
now
there
had
been
anxiety
formerly
now
there
was
something
like
despair
after
an
interval
of
hope
and
comparative
ease
mankind
are
ignorant
enough
heaven
knows
both
in
the
mass
about
general
interests
and
individually
about
the
things
which
belong
to
their
peace
but
of
all
mortals
none
perhaps
are
so
awfully
as
the
unamiable
they
do
not
any
more
than
others
sin
for
the
sake
of
sinning
but
the
amount
of
woe
caused
by
their
selfish
unconsciousness
is
such
as
may
well
make
their
weakness
an
equivalent
for
other
men
gravest
crimes
there
is
a
great
diversity
of
for
their
consciences
many
mansions
in
the
dim
prison
of
discontent
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
the
hour
when
all
shall
be
uncovered
to
the
eternal
day
there
will
be
revealed
a
lower
deep
than
the
hell
which
they
have
made
they
perhaps
are
the
only
order
of
evil
ones
who
suffer
hell
without
seeing
and
knowing
that
it
is
hell
but
they
are
under
a
heavier
curse
even
than
this
they
inflict
torments
second
only
to
their
own
with
an
unconsciousness
almost
worthy
of
spirits
of
light
while
they
complacently
conclude
themselves
the
victims
of
others
or
pronounce
inwardly
or
aloud
that
they
are
too
singular
or
too
refined
for
common
appreciation
they
are
putting
in
motion
an
enginery
of
torture
whose
aspect
will
one
day
blast
their
minds
sight
the
dumb
groans
of
their
victims
will
sooner
or
later
return
upon
their
ears
from
the
depths
of
the
heaven
to
which
the
sorrows
of
men
daily
ascend
the
spirit
sinks
under
the
prospect
of
the
retribution
of
the
unamiable
if
all
that
happens
be
indeed
for
eternity
if
there
be
indeed
a
record
an
impress
on
some
one
or
other
human
spirit
of
every
chilling
frown
of
every
querulous
tone
of
every
bitter
jest
of
every
insulting
word
of
all
abuses
of
that
tremendous
power
which
mind
has
over
mind
the
throbbing
pulses
the
quivering
nerves
the
wrung
hearts
that
surround
the
unamiable
what
a
cloud
of
witnesses
is
here
and
what
plea
shall
avail
against
them
the
terror
of
innocents
who
should
know
no
fear
the
vindictive
emotions
of
dependants
who
dare
not
complain
the
faintness
of
heart
of
companions
the
anguish
of
those
who
love
the
unholy
exultation
of
those
who
hate
what
an
array
of
judges
is
here
and
where
can
appeal
be
lodged
against
their
sentence
is
pride
of
singularity
a
rational
plea
is
or
circumstance
of
god
or
uncongeniality
in
man
a
sufficient
ground
of
appeal
when
the
refinement
of
one
is
a
grace
granted
for
the
luxury
of
all
when
circumstance
is
given
to
be
conquered
and
uncongeniality
is
appointed
for
discipline
the
sensualist
has
brutified
the
seraphic
nature
with
which
he
was
endowed
the
depredator
has
intercepted
the
rewards
of
toil
and
marred
the
image
of
justice
and
dimmed
the
lustre
of
faith
in
men
minds
the
imperial
tyrant
has
invoked
a
whirlwind
to
lay
waste
for
an
hour
of
eternal
year
some
region
of
society
but
the
unamiable
the
domestic
torturer
has
heaped
wrong
upon
wrong
and
woe
upon
woe
through
the
whole
portion
of
time
which
was
given
into
his
power
till
it
would
be
rash
to
say
that
any
others
are
more
guilty
than
he
if
there
be
hope
or
solace
for
such
it
is
that
there
may
have
been
tempers
about
him
the
opposite
of
his
own
it
is
matter
of
humiliating
gratitude
that
there
were
some
which
he
could
not
ruin
and
that
he
was
the
medium
of
discipline
by
which
they
were
exercised
in
forbearance
in
divine
forgiveness
and
love
if
there
be
solace
in
such
an
occasional
result
let
it
be
made
the
most
of
by
those
who
need
it
for
it
is
the
only
possible
alleviation
to
their
remorse
let
them
accept
it
as
the
free
gift
of
a
mercy
which
they
have
insulted
and
a
which
they
have
defied
not
thus
however
did
margaret
regard
the
case
of
her
sister
she
had
but
of
late
ceased
to
suppose
herself
in
the
wrong
when
hester
was
unhappy
and
though
she
was
now
relieved
from
the
responsibility
of
her
sister
peace
she
was
slow
to
blame
reluctant
to
class
the
case
lower
than
as
one
of
infirmity
her
last
waking
thoughts
and
they
were
very
late
were
of
pity
and
of
prayer
as
the
door
closed
behind
margaret
hope
had
flung
down
his
pen
in
one
moment
she
had
returned
for
a
book
and
she
found
him
by
the
fireside
leaning
his
head
upon
his
arms
against
the
wall
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
which
startled
her
out
of
her
wish
for
her
book
and
she
quietly
withdrew
without
it
he
turned
and
spoke
but
she
was
gone
so
this
is
home
thought
he
as
he
surveyed
the
room
filled
as
it
was
with
tokens
of
occupation
and
appliances
of
domestic
life
it
is
home
to
be
more
lonely
than
ever
before
and
yet
never
to
be
alone
with
my
secret
at
my
own
table
by
my
own
hearth
i
can
not
look
up
into
the
faces
around
me
nor
say
what
i
am
thinking
in
every
act
and
every
word
i
am
in
danger
of
disturbing
the
innocent
even
of
sullying
the
pure
and
of
breaking
the
bruised
reed
would
to
god
i
had
never
seen
them
how
have
i
abhorred
bondage
all
my
life
and
i
am
in
bondage
every
hour
that
i
spend
at
home
i
have
always
insisted
that
there
was
no
bondage
but
in
guilt
is
it
so
if
it
be
so
then
i
am
either
guilty
or
in
reality
free
i
have
settled
this
before
i
am
guilty
or
rather
i
have
been
guilty
and
this
is
my
retribution
not
guilty
towards
margaret
thank
god
i
have
done
her
no
wrong
thank
god
i
have
never
been
in
her
eyes
what
i
must
not
think
of
nor
could
i
ever
have
been
if
she
loves
enderby
i
am
certain
though
she
does
not
know
it
herself
it
is
a
blessing
that
she
loves
him
if
i
could
but
always
feel
it
so
i
am
not
guilty
towards
her
nor
towards
hester
except
in
the
weakness
of
declining
to
inflict
that
suffering
upon
her
which
fearful
as
it
must
have
been
might
perhaps
have
proved
less
than
with
all
my
care
she
must
undergo
now
there
was
my
fault
i
did
not
i
declare
seek
to
attach
her
i
did
nothing
wrong
so
far
but
i
dared
to
measure
suffering
to
calculate
consequences
presumptuously
and
vainly
and
this
is
my
retribution
how
would
it
have
been
if
i
had
allowed
them
to
go
back
to
birmingham
and
had
been
haunted
with
the
image
of
her
there
but
why
go
over
this
again
when
my
very
soul
is
weary
of
it
all
it
lies
behind
and
let
it
be
forgotten
the
present
is
what
i
have
to
do
with
and
it
is
quite
enough
i
have
injured
cruelly
injured
myself
and
i
must
bear
with
myself
here
i
am
charged
with
the
duty
of
not
casting
my
shadow
over
the
innocent
and
of
strengthening
the
infirm
i
have
a
clear
duty
before
me
that
is
one
blessing
the
innocent
will
soon
be
taken
from
under
my
shadow
i
trust
so
for
my
duty
there
is
almost
too
hard
how
she
would
confide
in
me
and
i
must
not
let
her
and
must
continually
disappoint
her
and
suffer
in
her
affection
i
can
not
even
be
to
her
what
our
relation
warrants
and
all
the
while
her
thoughts
are
my
thoughts
her
but
this
will
never
do
it
is
enough
that
she
trusts
me
and
that
i
deserve
that
she
should
this
is
all
that
i
can
ever
have
or
hope
for
but
i
have
won
thus
much
and
i
shall
keep
it
not
a
doubt
or
fear
not
a
moment
ruffle
of
spirits
shall
she
ever
experience
from
me
as
for
my
own
poor
sufferer
what
months
and
years
are
before
us
both
what
a
discipline
before
she
can
be
at
peace
if
she
were
to
look
forward
as
i
do
her
heart
would
sink
as
mine
does
and
perhaps
she
would
try
but
we
must
not
look
forward
her
heart
must
not
sink
i
must
keep
it
up
she
has
strength
under
her
weakness
and
i
must
help
her
to
bring
it
out
and
use
it
there
ought
to
be
there
must
be
peace
in
store
for
such
generosity
of
spirit
as
lies
under
the
jealousy
for
such
devotedness
for
such
power
margaret
says
it
comes
to
acting
see
how
she
will
act
oh
that
it
might
please
heaven
to
send
such
adversity
as
would
prove
to
herself
how
nobly
she
can
act
if
some
strong
call
on
her
power
would
come
in
aid
of
what
i
would
fain
do
for
her
i
care
not
what
it
is
if
i
can
only
witness
my
own
wrong
repaired
if
i
can
but
see
her
blessed
from
within
let
all
other
things
be
as
they
may
the
very
thought
frees
me
and
i
breathe
again
chapter
twenty
enderby
news
mamma
what
do
you
think
fanny
and
mary
grey
say
asked
matilda
of
her
mother
my
dear
i
wish
you
would
not
tease
me
with
what
the
greys
say
they
say
very
little
that
is
worth
repeating
well
but
you
must
hear
this
mamma
fanny
and
mary
were
walking
with
sophia
yesterday
and
they
met
mrs
hope
and
miss
ibbotson
in
lane
and
mrs
hope
was
crying
so
you
ca
think
indeed
crying
what
in
the
middle
of
the
day
yes
just
before
dinner
she
had
her
veil
down
and
she
did
not
want
to
stop
evidently
mamma
she
i
should
wonder
if
she
did
observed
mr
rowland
from
the
other
side
of
the
newspaper
he
was
reading
if
dr
and
mrs
levitt
were
to
come
in
the
next
time
you
cry
matilda
you
would
not
want
to
stay
in
the
parlour
evidently
i
should
think
for
my
part
i
never
show
my
face
when
i
am
crying
you
cry
papa
cried
little
anna
do
you
ever
cry
have
you
never
found
me
behind
the
deals
or
among
the
sacks
in
the
granary
with
my
finger
in
my
eye
no
papa
do
show
us
how
you
look
when
you
cry
mr
rowland
face
all
dolefulness
emerged
from
behind
the
newspaper
and
the
children
shouted
but
said
matilda
observing
that
her
mother
brow
began
to
lower
i
think
it
is
very
odd
that
mrs
hope
did
not
stay
at
home
if
she
wanted
to
cry
it
is
so
very
odd
to
go
crying
about
the
streets
i
dare
say
deerbrook
is
very
much
obliged
to
her
said
papa
it
will
be
something
to
talk
about
for
a
week
but
what
could
she
be
crying
for
papa
suppose
you
ask
her
my
dear
had
you
not
better
put
on
your
bonnet
and
go
directly
to
mr
hope
and
ask
with
our
compliments
what
mrs
hope
was
crying
for
at
four
yesterday
afternoon
of
course
she
can
tell
better
than
anybody
else
nonsense
mr
rowland
observed
his
lady
go
children
it
is
very
near
no
mamma
not
by
go
i
insist
upon
it
matilda
i
will
have
you
do
as
you
are
bid
go
george
go
now
my
love
did
i
not
tell
you
so
long
ago
do
not
you
remember
my
observing
to
you
how
coldly
mr
hope
took
our
congratulations
on
his
engagement
in
the
summer
i
was
sure
there
was
something
wrong
they
are
not
happy
depend
upon
it
what
a
charming
discovery
that
would
be
you
are
very
provoking
mr
rowland
i
do
believe
you
try
to
imitate
mr
grey
dry
way
of
talking
to
his
wife
i
thought
i
had
heard
you
admire
that
way
my
dear
for
her
yes
it
does
very
well
for
a
woman
like
her
but
i
beg
you
will
not
try
it
upon
me
mr
rowland
well
then
mrs
rowland
i
am
going
to
be
as
serious
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
when
i
warn
you
how
you
breathe
such
a
suspicion
as
that
the
hopes
are
not
happy
remember
you
have
no
evidence
whatever
about
the
matter
when
you
offered
mr
hope
your
congratulations
he
was
feeble
from
illness
and
probably
too
much
exhausted
at
the
moment
to
show
any
feeling
one
way
or
another
and
as
for
this
crying
fit
of
mrs
hope
no
one
is
better
able
than
you
my
dear
to
tell
how
many
causes
there
may
be
for
ladies
tears
besides
being
unhappily
married
pray
mr
rowland
make
yourself
easy
i
beg
whom
do
you
suppose
i
should
mention
such
a
thing
to
you
have
already
mentioned
it
to
yourself
and
me
my
dear
which
is
just
two
persons
too
many
not
a
word
more
on
the
subject
if
you
please
mrs
rowland
saw
that
this
was
one
of
her
husband
authority
days
rare
days
when
she
could
not
have
her
own
way
and
her
quiet
husband
was
really
formidable
she
buckled
on
her
armour
therefore
forthwith
that
armour
was
silence
mr
rowland
was
sufficiently
aware
of
the
process
now
to
be
gone
through
to
avoid
speaking
when
he
knew
he
should
obtain
no
reply
he
finished
his
newspaper
without
further
remark
looked
out
a
book
from
the
shelves
all
the
while
and
left
the
room
meantime
the
children
had
gone
to
the
schoolroom
disturbing
miss
young
nearly
an
hour
too
soon
miss
young
told
them
she
was
not
at
liberty
and
when
she
heard
that
their
mamma
had
sent
them
away
from
the
she
asked
why
they
could
not
play
as
usual
it
was
so
cold
how
did
george
manage
to
play
george
had
not
come
in
with
the
rest
if
he
could
play
so
could
they
the
little
girls
had
no
doubt
george
would
present
himself
soon
they
did
not
know
where
he
had
run
but
he
would
soon
have
enough
of
the
cold
abroad
or
of
the
dullness
of
the
nursery
in
another
moment
miss
young
was
informed
of
the
fact
of
hester
tears
of
yesterday
and
much
as
she
wanted
the
time
she
was
deprived
of
she
was
glad
the
children
had
come
to
her
that
this
piece
of
gossip
might
be
stopped
she
went
somewhat
at
length
with
them
into
the
subject
of
tears
showing
that
it
is
very
hasty
to
conclude
that
any
one
has
been
doing
wrong
even
in
the
case
of
a
child
weeping
and
much
more
with
regard
to
grown
people
when
they
had
arrived
at
wondering
whether
some
poor
person
had
been
begging
of
mrs
hope
or
whether
one
of
mr
hope
patients
that
she
cared
about
was
very
ill
or
whether
anybody
had
been
telling
her
an
affecting
story
miss
young
brought
them
to
see
that
they
ought
not
to
wish
to
know
that
they
should
no
more
desire
to
read
mrs
hope
thoughts
than
to
look
over
her
shoulder
while
she
was
writing
a
letter
she
was
just
telling
them
a
story
of
a
friend
of
hers
who
called
on
an
old
gentleman
and
found
him
in
very
low
spirits
with
his
eyes
all
red
and
swollen
and
how
her
friend
did
not
know
whether
to
take
any
notice
and
how
the
truth
came
out
that
the
old
gentleman
had
been
reading
a
touching
story
she
was
just
coming
to
the
end
of
this
anecdote
when
the
door
opened
and
margaret
entered
holding
george
by
the
hand
margaret
looked
rather
grave
and
said
i
thought
i
had
better
come
to
you
first
maria
for
an
explanation
which
you
may
be
able
to
give
do
you
know
who
sent
little
george
with
a
message
to
my
sister
just
now
i
concluded
you
did
not
george
has
been
calling
at
my
brother
door
with
his
papa
and
compliments
and
a
request
to
know
what
mrs
hope
was
crying
for
yesterday
at
four
maria
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
with
as
much
shame
as
if
she
had
been
in
fault
while
oh
george
was
reproachfully
uttered
by
the
little
girls
matilda
said
miss
young
i
trust
you
to
go
straight
to
your
papa
without
saying
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
else
and
to
ask
him
to
come
here
this
moment
i
trust
you
my
dear
matilda
discharged
her
trust
she
peeped
into
the
and
popped
out
again
without
speaking
when
she
saw
papa
was
no
longer
there
she
found
him
in
the
office
and
brought
him
without
giving
any
hint
of
what
had
happened
he
was
full
of
concern
of
course
said
that
he
could
not
blame
george
though
he
was
certainly
much
surprised
that
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
not
to
use
irony
with
children
since
even
the
broadest
might
be
thus
misunderstood
and
that
a
little
family
scene
had
thus
been
laid
open
which
he
should
hardly
regret
if
it
duly
impressed
his
children
with
the
folly
and
unkindness
of
village
gossip
he
declared
he
could
not
be
satisfied
without
apologising
well
then
without
explaining
to
mrs
hope
how
it
had
happened
and
he
would
do
it
through
the
medium
of
mr
hope
for
to
say
the
truth
he
was
ashamed
to
face
mrs
hope
till
his
peace
was
made
margaret
laughed
at
this
and
begged
him
to
go
home
with
her
but
he
preferred
stepping
over
to
mrs
enderby
where
mr
hope
had
just
been
seen
to
enter
mr
rowland
concluded
by
saying
that
he
should
accept
it
as
a
favour
in
miss
ibbotson
as
well
as
miss
young
if
she
would
steadily
refuse
to
gratify
any
impertinent
curiosity
shown
by
his
children
in
whatever
direction
it
might
show
itself
they
were
exposed
to
great
danger
from
example
in
deerbrook
like
most
children
brought
up
in
small
villages
he
supposed
and
he
owned
he
dreaded
the
idea
of
his
children
growing
up
the
scourges
to
society
that
he
considered
foolish
and
malignant
gossips
to
be
do
sit
down
margaret
said
maria
i
shall
feel
uncomfortable
when
you
are
gone
if
you
do
not
stay
a
minute
to
turn
our
thoughts
to
something
pleasanter
than
this
terrible
mistake
of
poor
george
i
can
not
stay
now
however
said
margaret
smiling
you
know
i
must
go
and
turn
my
sister
thoughts
to
something
pleasanter
there
she
is
sitting
at
home
waiting
to
know
how
all
this
has
happened
whether
she
has
not
been
insulted
you
are
right
margaret
make
haste
back
to
her
and
beg
her
pardon
for
us
all
shall
she
not
children
if
she
will
be
so
kind
margaret
was
overwhelmed
with
the
petitions
for
pardon
she
had
to
carry
and
not
one
of
the
children
asked
what
mrs
hope
had
been
crying
for
after
all
hester
looked
up
anxiously
as
margaret
entered
the
at
home
it
is
all
a
trifle
said
margaret
gaily
how
can
it
be
a
trifle
the
little
greys
told
what
they
saw
yesterday
of
course
and
one
of
the
little
rowlands
wondered
what
was
the
reason
children
can
never
understand
what
grown
people
who
have
no
lessons
to
learn
can
cry
for
you
know
and
mr
rowland
to
make
their
gossip
ridiculous
to
themselves
told
them
they
had
better
come
and
ask
and
poor
george
who
can
not
take
a
joke
came
without
any
one
knowing
where
he
was
gone
they
were
all
in
great
consternation
when
i
told
them
and
there
is
an
ample
apology
coming
to
you
through
edward
that
is
the
whole
story
except
that
mr
rowland
would
have
come
himself
to
you
instead
of
going
to
your
husband
but
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
joke
so
there
is
an
end
of
that
silly
matter
unless
it
be
to
make
george
always
ask
henceforth
whether
people
are
in
joke
or
in
earnest
i
think
mr
rowland
might
have
come
to
me
observed
hester
are
you
sure
mrs
rowland
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
neither
saw
her
nor
heard
of
her
you
had
better
not
go
out
it
is
so
like
snow
i
shall
be
back
soon
but
as
i
have
my
bonnet
on
i
shall
go
and
see
johnny
rye
and
his
mother
can
i
do
anything
for
you
oh
my
but
i
would
not
have
you
go
to
mrs
howell
while
she
is
in
such
a
mood
as
she
was
in
yesterday
i
would
not
go
myself
oh
i
will
go
i
am
not
afraid
of
mrs
howell
and
we
shall
have
to
encounter
her
again
sooner
or
later
i
will
buy
something
and
then
see
what
my
diplomacy
will
effect
about
the
boots
mr
hope
presently
came
in
and
found
his
wife
prepared
for
the
apology
he
brought
from
mr
rowland
but
it
was
obvious
that
hope
mind
was
far
more
occupied
with
something
else
where
is
margaret
she
is
gone
out
to
widow
rye
and
to
mrs
howell
no
matter
where
as
long
as
she
is
out
i
want
to
consult
you
about
something
and
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
told
that
he
had
visited
mrs
enderby
whom
he
found
very
poorly
apparently
from
agitation
of
spirits
she
had
shed
a
few
tears
on
reporting
her
health
and
had
dropped
something
which
he
could
not
understand
about
this
being
almost
the
last
time
she
should
be
able
to
speak
freely
to
him
hester
anxiously
hoped
that
the
good
old
lady
was
not
really
going
to
die
there
was
no
near
probability
of
this
her
husband
assured
her
he
thought
mrs
enderby
referred
to
some
other
change
than
dying
but
what
she
did
not
explain
she
had
gone
on
talking
in
rather
an
excited
way
and
at
last
hinted
that
she
supposed
she
should
not
see
her
son
for
some
time
as
mrs
rowland
had
intimated
that
he
was
fully
occupied
with
the
young
lady
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
mrs
enderby
plainly
said
that
she
had
not
heard
this
from
philip
himself
but
she
seemed
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
information
she
had
received
she
appeared
to
be
struggling
to
be
glad
at
the
news
but
it
was
clear
that
the
uppermost
feeling
was
disappointment
at
having
no
immediate
prospect
of
seeing
her
son
now
what
are
we
to
think
and
do
said
hope
this
agrees
with
what
mrs
rowland
told
me
in
dingleford
woods
six
months
ago
said
hester
and
i
suppose
what
she
then
said
may
have
been
true
all
this
time
how
does
that
agree
with
his
conduct
to
margaret
or
am
i
mistaken
in
what
i
have
told
you
i
thought
about
that
seriously
very
seriously
how
do
you
suppose
the
case
stands
with
margaret
i
know
no
more
than
you
i
think
he
went
further
than
he
ought
if
he
was
thinking
of
another
and
but
for
his
conduct
since
i
should
have
quite
concluded
from
some
observations
that
i
made
that
he
was
attached
to
margaret
and
she
and
she
certainly
likes
him
very
well
but
i
can
hardly
fancy
her
happiness
at
stake
i
have
thought
her
spirit
rather
flat
of
late
hope
sighed
deeply
ah
you
may
well
sigh
said
hester
sighing
herself
and
sinking
back
in
her
chair
you
know
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
thought
i
might
be
the
cause
of
her
being
less
gay
than
she
should
be
i
have
disappointed
her
expectations
i
know
but
let
us
talk
only
of
her
yes
let
us
talk
only
of
her
till
we
have
settled
what
is
our
duty
to
her
ought
we
to
tell
her
of
this
or
not
both
considered
long
at
length
hester
said
i
think
she
ought
to
hear
it
quietly
at
home
first
whether
it
be
true
or
not
to
prepare
her
for
anything
that
may
be
reported
abroad
perhaps
if
you
were
to
drop
as
we
sit
together
here
what
mrs
enderby
said
no
no
not
i
said
hope
quickly
he
went
on
more
calmly
her
sister
and
bosom
friend
is
the
only
person
to
do
this
if
indeed
it
ought
to
be
done
but
the
news
may
be
untrue
and
then
she
need
perhaps
never
hear
it
do
not
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
hester
thought
that
if
margaret
felt
nothing
more
than
friendship
for
enderby
she
would
still
consider
herself
for
the
friendship
had
been
so
close
an
one
that
she
might
reasonably
expect
that
she
should
not
be
left
to
learn
such
an
event
as
this
from
common
report
but
was
it
certain
hope
asked
that
she
had
anything
new
to
learn
was
it
certain
that
she
was
not
in
his
confidence
all
this
time
that
she
had
not
known
ten
times
as
much
as
mrs
rowland
from
the
beginning
certainly
not
from
the
beginning
hester
said
and
she
had
a
strong
persuasion
that
margaret
was
as
ignorant
as
themselves
of
present
proceedings
and
intentions
at
this
moment
a
note
was
brought
in
it
was
from
mrs
enderby
to
mr
hope
written
hurriedly
and
blistered
with
tears
it
told
that
she
had
been
extremely
wrong
in
mentioning
to
him
prematurely
what
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
about
a
certain
family
affair
and
begged
the
great
favour
of
him
to
keep
to
himself
what
she
had
divulged
and
if
possible
to
forget
it
once
more
mr
hope
unconsciously
sighed
it
was
at
the
idea
that
he
could
forget
such
a
piece
of
intelligence
poor
old
lady
said
hester
she
has
been
taken
to
task
i
suppose
for
relieving
her
mind
to
you
but
edward
this
looks
more
and
more
as
if
the
news
were
true
my
darling
margaret
how
will
it
be
with
her
does
it
not
look
too
like
being
true
love
it
looks
as
if
enderby
family
all
believed
it
certainly
this
note
settles
the
matter
of
our
duty
however
if
the
affair
is
so
private
that
mrs
enderby
is
to
be
punished
for
telling
me
it
is
hardly
likely
that
margaret
will
hear
it
by
chance
you
are
spared
the
task
for
the
present
at
least
my
dear
i
should
like
to
be
sure
that
margaret
does
not
love
that
she
might
pass
through
life
without
loving
said
hester
sighing
but
here
she
comes
burn
the
note
the
note
curled
in
the
flames
was
consumed
and
its
ashes
fluttered
up
the
chimney
and
margaret
did
not
enter
she
had
gone
straight
she
did
not
come
down
till
dinner
was
on
the
table
she
was
then
prepared
with
the
announcement
that
the
might
be
looked
for
very
soon
she
told
of
her
visit
to
widow
rye
and
had
something
to
say
of
the
probability
of
snow
but
she
was
rather
absent
and
she
took
wine
these
were
all
the
circumstances
that
her
anxious
sister
could
fix
upon
during
dinner
for
silent
comment
after
dinner
having
eaten
an
orange
with
something
like
avidity
margaret
withdrew
for
a
very
few
minutes
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
hester
whispered
she
has
heard
she
knows
is
it
not
so
there
is
no
question
about
it
replied
hope
examining
the
screen
he
held
in
his
hand
i
wonder
who
can
have
told
her
tellers
of
bad
news
are
never
wanting
especially
in
deerbrook
said
hope
with
a
bitterness
of
tone
which
hester
had
never
heard
from
him
before
margaret
took
up
the
other
screen
when
she
returned
and
played
with
it
till
the
table
was
cleared
so
that
she
could
have
the
use
of
her
it
was
morris
who
removed
the
dessert
morris
said
mr
hope
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
i
want
charles
pray
send
him
charles
is
out
sir
out
when
will
he
be
back
he
will
be
back
presently
said
margaret
i
sent
him
with
a
note
to
maria
as
she
leant
over
her
work
again
hester
and
her
husband
exchanged
glances
an
answer
from
maria
soon
arrived
margaret
read
it
as
she
sat
her
brother
and
sister
carefully
withdrawing
their
observation
from
her
whatever
else
might
be
in
the
note
she
read
aloud
the
latter
part
two
or
three
lines
relating
to
the
incident
of
the
morning
her
voice
was
husky
but
her
manner
was
gay
during
the
whole
evening
she
was
gay
she
insisted
on
making
tea
and
was
too
quick
with
the
kettle
for
edward
to
help
her
she
proposed
music
and
she
sang
song
after
song
hester
was
completely
relieved
about
her
and
even
edward
gave
himself
up
to
the
hope
that
all
was
well
with
her
from
music
they
got
to
dancing
margaret
had
learned
by
sitting
with
maria
during
the
a
new
dance
which
had
struck
her
fancy
and
they
must
be
ready
with
it
next
week
at
dr
levitt
alternately
playing
the
dance
and
teaching
it
she
ran
from
the
piano
to
them
and
from
them
to
the
piano
till
they
were
perfect
and
her
face
was
as
flushed
as
it
could
possibly
be
at
mrs
levitt
dance
next
week
but
in
the
midst
of
this
flush
hope
saw
a
shiver
and
hester
remarked
that
during
the
teaching
margaret
had
evidently
without
being
aware
of
it
squeezed
her
hand
with
a
force
which
could
not
have
been
supposed
to
be
in
her
these
things
made
hope
still
doubt
chapter
twenty
one
consciousness
to
the
unconscious
mr
hope
might
well
doubt
margaret
was
not
gay
but
desperate
yes
even
the
innocent
may
be
desperate
under
circumstances
of
education
and
custom
by
which
feelings
natural
and
inevitable
are
made
occasions
of
shame
while
others
which
are
wrong
and
against
the
better
nature
of
man
bask
in
daylight
and
impunity
there
was
not
a
famishing
wretch
prowling
about
a
baker
door
more
desperate
than
margaret
this
day
there
was
not
a
gambler
setting
his
teeth
while
watching
the
last
turn
of
the
die
more
desperate
than
margaret
this
day
if
there
was
a
criminal
standing
above
a
sea
of
faces
with
the
abominable
hands
about
his
throat
margaret
was
for
the
time
as
wretched
as
he
if
any
asked
why
why
it
should
be
thus
with
one
who
has
done
no
wrong
the
answer
is
why
is
there
pride
in
the
human
heart
why
is
there
a
particular
nurture
of
this
pride
into
womanly
reserve
why
is
it
that
love
is
the
chief
experience
and
almost
the
only
object
of
a
life
why
is
it
that
it
is
painful
to
beings
who
look
before
and
after
to
have
the
one
hope
of
existence
dashed
away
the
generous
faith
outraged
all
overthrown
life
in
one
moment
made
dreary
as
the
desert
heaven
itself
overclouded
and
death
all
the
while
standing
at
such
a
weary
distance
that
there
is
no
refuge
within
the
horizon
of
endurance
be
these
things
right
or
wrong
they
are
and
while
they
are
will
the
woman
who
loves
unrequited
feel
desperate
on
the
discovery
of
her
loneliness
and
the
more
pure
and
proud
innocent
and
humble
the
more
lonely
for
some
little
time
past
margaret
had
been
in
a
state
of
great
tranquillity
about
philip
a
tranquillity
which
she
now
much
wondered
at
now
that
it
was
all
over
she
had
had
an
unconscious
faith
in
him
and
living
in
this
faith
she
had
forgotten
herself
she
had
not
thought
of
the
future
she
had
not
felt
impatient
for
any
change
often
as
she
wished
for
his
presence
irksome
as
she
had
sometimes
felt
it
to
know
nothing
of
him
from
week
to
week
she
had
been
tacitly
satisfied
that
she
was
in
his
thoughts
as
he
was
in
hers
and
this
had
been
enough
for
the
time
what
an
awakening
from
this
quiescent
state
was
hers
this
day
it
was
from
no
other
than
dr
levitt
that
she
had
heard
in
the
morning
that
mr
enderby
was
shortly
going
to
be
married
to
miss
mary
bruce
dr
levitt
was
at
widow
rye
when
margaret
went
and
had
walked
part
of
the
way
home
with
her
during
the
walk
this
piece
of
news
had
dropped
out
while
they
were
talking
of
mrs
enderby
health
all
that
dr
levitt
knew
of
miss
mary
bruce
was
that
she
was
of
sufficiently
good
family
and
fortune
to
make
the
rowlands
extremely
well
satisfied
with
the
match
that
mrs
enderby
had
never
seen
her
and
that
it
would
be
some
time
before
she
could
see
her
as
the
whole
family
of
the
bruces
was
at
rome
for
the
winter
when
dr
levitt
parted
from
margaret
at
the
gate
of
the
churchyard
these
last
words
contained
the
hope
she
clung
to
a
hope
which
might
turn
into
the
deepest
reason
for
despair
philip
had
certainly
not
been
abroad
was
it
likely
that
he
should
lately
have
become
engaged
to
any
young
lady
who
had
been
some
time
in
rome
it
was
not
likely
but
then
if
it
was
true
he
must
have
been
long
engaged
he
must
have
been
engaged
at
the
time
of
his
last
visit
of
six
days
when
he
had
talked
over
his
views
of
life
with
margaret
and
been
so
anxious
to
obtain
hers
he
must
surely
have
been
engaged
in
the
summer
when
she
found
tieck
in
the
desk
and
when
he
used
to
spend
so
many
evenings
at
the
greys
certainly
not
on
hester
account
at
one
moment
she
was
confident
all
this
could
not
be
she
was
relieved
she
stepped
lightly
the
next
moment
a
misgiving
came
that
it
was
all
too
true
the
weight
fell
again
upon
her
heart
she
lost
breath
and
it
was
intolerable
to
have
to
curtesy
to
mrs
james
and
to
answer
the
butcher
inquiry
about
the
meat
that
had
been
ordered
if
these
people
would
only
go
on
with
their
own
business
and
take
no
notice
of
her
then
again
the
thought
occurred
that
she
knew
philip
better
than
any
than
even
his
own
family
and
that
say
what
they
might
he
was
all
her
own
in
these
changes
of
mood
she
had
got
through
dinner
the
dominant
idea
was
then
that
she
must
by
some
means
or
other
obtain
certainty
she
thought
of
maria
maria
was
likely
to
know
the
facts
from
her
constant
intercourse
with
the
rowlands
and
besides
there
was
certainly
a
something
in
maria
mind
in
relation
to
philip
a
keen
insight
which
might
be
owing
to
the
philosophical
habit
of
her
mind
or
to
something
else
but
which
issued
in
information
about
him
which
it
was
surprising
that
she
could
obtain
she
seldom
spoke
of
him
but
when
she
did
it
was
wonderfully
to
the
purpose
margaret
thought
she
could
learn
from
maria
in
a
very
simple
and
natural
way
that
which
she
so
much
wished
to
know
and
when
she
left
the
room
after
dinner
it
was
to
write
the
note
which
might
bring
certainty
dear
friend
i
saw
dr
levitt
this
morning
while
i
was
out
and
he
told
me
with
all
possible
assurance
that
mr
enderby
is
going
to
be
married
very
shortly
to
a
young
lady
at
rome
miss
mary
bruce
now
this
is
true
or
it
is
not
if
true
you
are
as
well
aware
as
we
are
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
known
it
otherwise
and
earlier
than
by
common
report
if
not
true
the
rumour
should
not
be
allowed
to
spread
if
you
know
anything
certainly
one
way
or
the
other
pray
tell
us
yours
affectionately
margaret
ibbotson
the
we
and
us
were
not
quite
honest
but
margaret
meant
to
make
them
as
nearly
so
as
possible
by
communication
with
her
brother
and
sister
a
resolution
so
easily
made
that
it
did
not
occur
to
her
how
difficult
it
might
be
to
execute
while
her
messenger
was
gone
she
wrought
herself
up
to
a
resolution
to
bear
the
answer
whatever
it
might
be
with
the
same
quietness
with
which
she
must
bear
the
whole
of
her
future
life
if
dr
levitt
news
should
prove
to
be
founded
in
fact
the
door
opening
seemed
to
prick
the
nerves
of
her
ears
her
heart
heaved
to
her
throat
at
the
sight
of
the
white
paper
yet
it
was
with
neatness
that
she
broke
the
seal
and
with
a
steady
hand
that
she
held
the
note
to
read
it
the
handwriting
was
only
too
distinct
it
seemed
to
burn
itself
in
upon
her
brain
all
was
over
dear
margaret
i
do
not
know
where
dr
levitt
got
his
news
but
i
believe
it
is
true
mrs
rowland
pretends
to
absolute
certainty
about
her
brother
engagement
to
miss
bruce
and
it
is
from
this
that
others
speak
so
positively
about
it
whatever
are
the
grounds
that
mrs
goes
upon
there
are
others
which
afford
a
strong
presumption
that
she
is
right
some
of
these
may
be
known
to
you
they
leave
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
report
is
true
as
to
the
failure
of
confidence
in
his
friends
what
can
be
said
unless
by
way
of
reminder
of
the
old
truth
that
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
wrongs
be
they
but
deep
enough
may
chasten
a
human
temper
into
something
divine
george
has
been
very
grave
for
the
last
three
hours
pandering
i
fancy
what
irony
can
be
for
your
sister
will
not
grudge
him
his
lesson
though
afforded
at
her
expense
yours
affectionately
maria
young
wrongs
thought
she
maria
goes
too
far
when
she
speaks
of
wrongs
there
was
nothing
in
my
note
to
bring
such
an
expression
in
answer
it
is
going
too
far
this
was
but
the
irritability
of
a
racked
soul
needing
to
spend
its
agony
somewhere
the
remembrance
of
the
conversation
with
maria
held
so
lately
and
of
maria
views
of
philip
relation
to
her
returned
upon
her
and
her
soul
melted
within
her
she
felt
that
maria
had
understood
her
better
than
she
did
herself
and
was
justified
in
the
words
she
had
used
under
severe
calamity
to
be
endured
alone
evil
thoughts
sometimes
come
before
good
ones
margaret
was
for
an
hour
or
two
possessed
with
the
bad
spirit
of
defiance
her
mind
sank
back
into
what
it
had
been
in
her
childhood
when
she
had
hidden
herself
in
the
or
behind
the
for
many
hours
to
make
the
family
uneasy
because
she
had
been
punished
in
the
days
when
she
bore
every
infliction
that
her
father
dared
to
try
with
apparent
unconcern
rather
than
show
to
watchful
eyes
that
she
was
moved
in
the
days
when
the
slightest
concession
would
dissolve
her
stubbornness
in
an
instant
but
when
to
get
rid
of
a
life
of
contradiction
she
had
had
serious
thoughts
of
cutting
her
throat
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
door
to
get
the
and
had
been
much
disappointed
to
find
the
servants
at
dinner
and
the
out
of
reach
this
spirit
so
long
ago
driven
out
by
the
genial
influences
of
family
love
by
the
religion
of
an
expanding
intellect
and
the
solace
of
appreciation
now
came
back
to
inhabit
the
purified
bosom
which
had
been
kept
carefully
swept
and
garnished
it
was
the
motion
of
this
spirit
uneasy
in
its
unfit
abode
that
showed
itself
by
the
shiver
the
flushed
cheek
the
clenching
hand
and
the
flashing
eye
it
kept
whispering
wicked
things
i
will
baffle
and
deceive
maria
she
shall
withdraw
her
pity
and
laugh
at
it
with
me
i
defy
edward
and
hester
they
shall
wonder
how
it
is
that
my
fancy
alone
is
free
that
my
heart
alone
is
untouched
that
the
storms
of
life
pass
high
over
my
head
and
dare
not
lower
i
will
humble
philip
and
convince
him
but
no
it
would
not
do
the
abode
was
too
lowly
and
too
pure
for
the
evil
spirit
of
defiance
the
demon
did
not
wait
to
be
cast
out
but
as
margaret
sat
down
in
her
chamber
alone
with
her
lot
to
face
it
as
she
might
the
strange
inmate
escaped
and
left
her
at
least
herself
margaret
was
in
agonised
amazement
at
the
newness
of
the
misery
she
was
suffering
she
really
fancied
she
had
sympathised
with
hester
that
dreadful
night
of
hope
accident
she
had
then
actually
believed
that
she
was
entering
into
her
sister
feelings
it
had
been
as
much
like
it
as
seeing
a
picture
of
one
on
the
rack
is
like
being
racked
but
hester
had
not
had
so
much
cause
for
misery
for
she
never
had
to
believe
edward
unworthy
her
pride
had
been
wounded
at
finding
that
her
peace
was
no
longer
in
her
own
power
but
she
had
not
been
trifled
with
duped
here
again
margaret
refused
to
believe
the
fault
was
all
her
own
she
had
been
full
of
herself
full
of
vanity
fancying
without
cause
that
she
was
much
to
another
when
she
was
little
she
was
humbled
now
and
she
no
doubt
deserved
it
but
how
ineffably
weak
and
mean
did
she
appear
in
her
own
eyes
it
was
this
which
clouded
heaven
to
her
at
the
moment
that
earth
had
become
a
desert
she
felt
so
debased
that
she
durst
not
ask
for
strength
where
she
was
wont
to
find
it
if
she
had
done
one
single
wrong
thing
she
thought
she
could
bear
the
consequences
cheerfully
and
seek
support
and
vigorously
set
about
repairing
the
causes
of
her
fault
but
here
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
whole
state
of
mind
had
been
low
and
selfish
it
must
be
this
sort
of
blindness
which
had
led
her
so
far
in
so
fearful
a
delusion
and
if
the
whole
condition
of
her
mind
had
been
low
and
selfish
while
her
conscience
had
given
her
no
hint
of
anything
being
amiss
where
was
she
to
begin
to
rectify
her
being
she
felt
wholly
degraded
and
then
what
a
set
of
pictures
rose
up
before
her
excited
fancy
philip
going
forth
for
a
walk
with
her
and
hester
after
having
just
sealed
a
letter
to
miss
bruce
carrying
the
consciousness
of
what
he
had
been
saying
to
the
mistress
of
his
heart
while
she
margaret
had
supposed
herself
the
chief
object
of
his
thought
and
care
again
philip
discussing
her
mind
and
character
with
miss
bruce
as
those
of
a
friend
for
whom
he
had
a
regard
or
bestowing
a
passing
imagination
on
how
she
would
receive
the
intelligence
of
his
engagement
perhaps
he
reserved
the
news
till
he
could
come
down
to
deerbrook
and
call
and
tell
her
himself
as
one
whose
friendship
deserved
that
he
should
be
the
bearer
of
his
own
tidings
that
footstep
whose
spring
she
had
strangely
considered
her
own
signal
of
joy
was
not
hers
but
another
that
laugh
the
recollection
of
which
made
her
smile
even
in
these
dreadful
moments
was
to
echo
in
another
home
she
was
stripped
of
all
her
heart
treasure
of
his
tones
his
ways
his
thoughts
a
treasure
which
she
had
lived
upon
without
knowing
it
she
was
stripped
of
it
all
cast
out
left
alone
and
he
and
all
others
would
go
on
their
ways
unaware
that
anything
had
happened
let
them
do
so
it
was
hard
to
bear
up
in
solitude
when
was
gone
with
all
the
rest
but
it
must
be
possible
to
live
on
no
matter
how
if
to
live
on
was
appointed
if
not
there
was
death
which
was
better
these
thoughts
were
not
beneath
one
like
margaret
one
who
was
religious
as
she
it
requires
time
for
religion
to
avail
anything
when
is
utterly
a
devout
sufferer
may
surmount
the
pangs
of
persecution
at
the
first
onset
and
wrestle
with
bodily
pain
and
calmly
endure
bereavement
by
death
but
there
is
no
power
of
faith
by
which
a
woman
can
attain
resignation
under
the
agony
of
unrequited
passion
otherwise
than
by
conflict
long
and
terrible
margaret
laid
down
at
last
because
her
eyes
were
weary
of
seeing
and
she
would
fain
have
shut
out
all
sounds
the
occasional
flicker
of
a
tiny
blaze
however
and
the
fall
of
a
cinder
in
the
hearth
served
to
lull
her
senses
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
slept
but
oh
the
horrors
of
that
sleep
the
lines
of
maria
note
stared
her
in
the
face
glaring
glowing
gigantic
sometimes
she
was
trying
to
read
them
and
could
not
though
her
life
depended
on
them
now
mrs
rowland
had
got
hold
of
them
and
now
they
were
thrown
into
the
flames
but
would
not
burn
and
the
letters
grew
then
came
the
image
of
philip
and
that
horror
was
mixed
up
with
whatever
was
most
ludicrous
once
she
was
struggling
for
voice
to
speak
to
him
and
he
mocked
her
useless
efforts
oh
how
she
struggled
till
some
strong
arm
raised
her
and
some
other
voice
murmured
gently
in
her
throbbing
ear
wake
my
dear
wake
up
margaret
what
is
it
dear
wake
mother
is
it
you
oh
mother
have
you
come
at
last
murmured
margaret
sinking
her
head
on
morris
shoulder
it
was
some
moments
before
margaret
felt
a
warm
tear
fall
upon
her
cheek
and
heard
morris
say
no
my
dear
not
yet
your
mother
is
in
a
better
place
than
this
where
we
shall
all
rest
with
her
at
last
miss
margaret
what
is
all
this
said
margaret
raising
herself
and
looking
round
her
what
did
i
mean
about
my
mother
oh
morris
my
head
is
all
confused
and
i
think
i
have
been
frightened
they
were
laughing
at
me
and
when
somebody
came
to
help
me
i
thought
it
must
be
my
mother
oh
morris
it
is
a
long
while
i
wish
i
was
with
her
morris
did
not
desire
to
hear
what
margaret
dream
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
margaret
distress
she
did
not
know
but
she
had
for
some
time
suspected
that
which
only
one
person
in
the
world
was
aware
of
besides
herself
the
terrible
secret
of
this
household
was
no
secret
to
her
she
was
experienced
enough
in
love
and
its
signs
to
know
without
being
told
where
love
was
absent
and
where
it
rested
she
had
not
doubted
up
to
the
return
from
the
that
all
was
right
but
she
had
never
been
quite
happy
since
she
had
perceived
no
sign
that
either
sister
was
aware
of
the
truth
the
continuance
of
their
sisterly
friendship
was
a
proof
that
neither
of
them
was
but
she
wished
to
avoid
hearing
the
particulars
of
margaret
dream
and
all
revelations
which
in
the
weakness
and
confusion
of
an
hour
like
this
she
might
be
tempted
to
make
morris
withdrew
from
margaret
clasp
moved
softly
across
the
room
gently
put
the
red
embers
together
in
the
grate
and
lighted
the
lamp
which
stood
on
the
table
i
hope
whispered
margaret
trying
to
still
her
shivering
that
nobody
heard
me
but
you
how
came
you
to
think
of
coming
to
me
my
room
being
over
this
you
know
it
was
easy
to
hear
the
voice
of
a
person
in
an
uneasy
sleep
i
am
glad
i
happened
to
be
awake
so
i
put
on
my
cloak
and
came
morris
did
not
say
that
edward
had
heard
the
stifled
cry
also
and
that
she
had
met
him
on
the
stairs
coming
to
beg
that
she
would
see
what
could
be
done
hester
having
slept
through
it
margaret
need
never
know
that
other
ears
than
morris
had
heard
her
thus
had
hope
and
morris
tacitly
agreed
now
my
dear
when
i
have
warmed
this
flannel
to
put
about
your
feet
you
must
go
to
sleep
again
i
will
not
leave
you
till
daylight
till
the
house
is
near
being
astir
so
you
may
sleep
without
being
afraid
of
bad
dreams
i
will
rouse
you
if
i
see
you
disturbed
now
no
more
talking
or
we
shall
have
the
house
up
and
all
this
had
better
be
between
you
and
me
to
satisfy
margaret
morris
lay
down
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
warmly
covered
and
the
nurse
once
more
as
in
old
days
felt
her
favourite
child
breathing
quietly
against
her
shoulder
once
more
she
wiped
away
the
standing
tears
and
prayed
in
her
heart
for
the
object
of
her
care
if
her
prayer
had
had
words
it
would
have
been
this
thou
hast
been
pleased
to
take
to
thyself
the
parents
of
these
dear
children
and
surely
thou
wilt
be
therefore
pleased
to
be
to
them
as
father
and
mother
or
to
raise
up
or
spare
to
them
such
as
may
be
so
this
is
what
i
would
ask
for
myself
that
i
may
be
that
comfort
to
them
thou
knowest
that
a
strange
trouble
hath
entered
this
house
thou
knowest
for
thine
eye
seeth
beneath
the
face
into
the
heart
as
the
sun
shines
into
a
locked
chamber
at
noon
thou
knowest
what
these
young
creatures
know
not
make
holy
to
them
what
thou
knowest
let
thy
silence
rest
upon
that
which
must
not
be
spoken
let
thy
strength
be
supplied
where
temptation
is
hardest
let
the
innocence
which
has
come
forth
from
thine
own
hand
be
kept
fit
to
appear
in
all
the
light
of
thy
countenance
oh
let
them
never
be
seen
sinking
with
shame
before
thee
father
if
thou
hast
made
thy
children
to
love
one
another
for
their
good
let
not
love
be
a
grief
and
a
snare
to
such
as
these
thou
canst
turn
the
hearts
even
of
the
wicked
turn
the
hearts
of
these
thy
dutiful
children
to
love
where
love
may
be
all
honour
and
no
shame
so
that
they
may
have
no
more
mysteries
from
each
other
as
i
am
sure
they
have
none
from
thee
all
who
know
them
have
doubtless
asked
thy
blessing
on
their
house
their
health
their
basket
and
store
let
me
ask
it
also
on
the
workings
of
their
hearts
since
if
their
hearts
be
right
all
is
well
or
will
be
in
thine
own
best
time
when
margaret
entered
the
in
the
morning
she
found
her
brother
sketching
the
skaters
of
deerbrook
while
the
tea
was
brewing
hester
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
laughing
as
she
recognised
one
after
another
of
her
neighbours
in
the
act
of
skating
this
one
by
the
stoop
that
by
the
formality
and
the
other
by
the
flying
out
behind
no
inquiries
were
made
not
a
word
was
said
of
health
or
spirits
it
seems
strange
that
sufferers
have
not
yet
found
means
to
stop
the
practice
of
such
inquiries
a
practice
begun
in
kindness
and
carried
on
in
the
spirit
of
hospitality
but
productive
of
great
annoyance
to
all
but
those
who
do
not
need
such
inquiries
the
healthful
and
the
happy
there
are
multitudes
of
invalids
who
can
give
no
comfortable
answer
respecting
their
health
and
who
are
averse
from
giving
an
uncomfortable
one
and
for
whom
nothing
is
therefore
left
but
evasion
there
are
only
too
many
sufferers
to
whom
it
is
irksome
to
be
questioned
about
their
hours
of
sleeplessness
or
who
do
not
choose
to
have
it
known
that
they
have
not
slept
the
unpleasant
old
custom
of
pressing
people
to
eat
has
gone
out
the
sooner
the
other
observance
of
hospitality
is
allowed
to
follow
it
the
better
all
who
like
to
tell
of
illness
and
sleeplessness
can
do
so
and
those
who
have
reasons
for
reserve
upon
such
points
as
margaret
had
this
morning
can
keep
their
own
counsel
at
the
earliest
possible
hour
that
the
etiquette
of
deerbrook
would
allow
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
that
must
be
mrs
rowland
exclaimed
hester
one
may
know
that
woman
temper
by
her
knock
so
consequential
and
yet
so
sharp
margaret
love
you
can
run
upstairs
there
is
time
yet
if
you
do
not
wish
to
see
her
why
should
i
said
margaret
looking
up
with
a
calmness
which
perplexed
hester
this
is
either
ignorance
thought
she
or
such
patience
as
i
wish
i
had
it
mrs
rowland
and
she
come
to
tell
what
hester
feared
margaret
might
not
be
able
to
bear
to
hear
she
was
attended
only
by
the
little
fellow
who
was
so
fond
of
riding
on
uncle
philip
shoulder
it
was
rather
lucky
that
ned
came
as
margaret
was
furnished
with
something
to
do
in
taking
off
his
worsted
gloves
and
rubbing
his
little
red
hands
between
her
own
and
then
she
could
say
a
great
many
things
to
him
about
learning
to
slide
and
the
difficulty
of
keeping
on
the
nose
and
about
her
wonder
that
they
had
not
thought
of
putting
a
pipe
into
his
mouth
before
this
subject
was
finished
mrs
rowland
turned
full
round
to
margaret
and
said
that
the
purpose
of
her
visit
was
to
explain
fully
something
that
her
poor
mother
had
let
drop
yesterday
to
mr
hope
her
mother
was
not
what
she
had
been
though
indeed
she
had
always
been
rather
apt
to
let
out
things
that
she
should
not
she
found
that
mr
hope
had
been
informed
by
her
mother
of
her
brother
philip
engagement
to
a
charming
young
lady
who
would
indeed
be
a
great
ornament
to
the
connexion
i
assure
you
said
margaret
my
brother
is
very
careful
and
always
remembers
that
he
is
upon
honour
as
to
what
he
hears
in
a
he
has
not
mentioned
it
oh
then
it
is
safe
we
are
much
obliged
to
mr
hope
i
am
sure
i
said
to
my
mother
dear
but
i
must
mention
said
margaret
that
the
news
was
abroad
before
i
must
beg
that
you
will
not
suppose
my
brother
has
spoken
of
it
if
you
should
find
that
everybody
knows
it
i
heard
it
from
dr
levitt
yesterday
about
the
same
time
i
fancy
that
mr
hope
was
hearing
it
from
mrs
enderby
hester
sat
perfectly
still
to
avoid
all
danger
of
showing
that
this
was
news
to
her
how
very
strange
exclaimed
the
lady
i
often
say
there
is
no
keeping
anything
quiet
in
deerbrook
do
you
know
where
dr
levitt
got
his
information
no
said
margaret
smiling
dr
levitt
generally
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
i
dare
say
he
had
it
from
some
good
authority
the
young
lady
is
at
rome
i
find
are
you
acquainted
with
miss
bruce
asked
hester
thinking
it
time
to
relieve
margaret
of
her
share
of
the
conversation
margaret
started
a
little
on
finding
that
her
sister
had
heard
the
news
was
it
possible
that
her
brother
and
sister
had
been
afraid
to
tell
her
no
it
was
a
piece
of
edward
professional
discretion
his
wife
alone
had
a
right
to
the
news
he
heard
among
his
patients
oh
yes
replied
mrs
rowland
i
have
long
loved
mary
as
a
sister
their
early
attachment
made
a
sister
of
her
to
me
an
age
ago
it
has
been
a
long
engagement
then
said
hester
glad
to
say
anything
which
might
occupy
mrs
rowland
as
margaret
lips
were
now
turning
very
white
not
now
my
dear
margaret
was
heard
to
say
to
little
ned
over
whom
she
was
bending
her
head
as
he
stood
by
her
side
stand
still
here
she
continued
with
wonderful
cheerfulness
of
tone
i
want
to
hear
your
mamma
tell
us
about
uncle
philip
with
the
effort
her
strength
rallied
and
the
paleness
was
gone
before
mrs
rowland
had
turned
round
how
long
the
engagement
has
existed
said
the
lady
i
can
not
venture
to
say
i
speak
only
of
the
attachment
young
people
understand
their
own
affairs
you
know
and
have
their
little
mysteries
and
laugh
behind
our
backs
i
dare
say
at
our
ignorance
of
what
they
are
about
philip
has
been
sly
enough
as
to
this
i
own
but
i
must
say
i
had
my
suspicions
i
was
pretty
confident
of
his
being
engaged
from
the
day
that
he
told
me
in
the
summer
that
he
fully
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
time
he
was
settled
how
differently
some
people
understood
that
thought
hester
and
margaret
at
the
same
moment
is
mr
enderby
at
rome
now
asked
hester
no
he
is
hard
at
work
studying
law
he
is
really
going
to
apply
to
a
profession
now
not
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
mary
has
a
very
good
fortune
but
mary
wishes
so
much
that
he
should
like
a
sensible
girl
as
she
is
it
is
what
i
urged
when
he
consulted
me
thought
margaret
she
had
had
little
idea
whose
counsel
she
was
following
up
we
shall
soon
hear
of
his
setting
off
for
the
continent
however
i
have
no
doubt
said
the
lady
to
bring
home
his
bride
observed
margaret
calmly
why
i
do
not
know
that
the
bruces
will
be
returning
early
in
the
spring
and
i
should
like
the
young
people
to
marry
in
town
that
we
may
have
them
here
for
their
wedding
trip
how
you
do
hug
me
cried
the
laughing
little
boy
around
whom
margaret
arm
was
passed
have
i
made
you
warm
at
last
asked
margaret
if
not
you
may
go
and
stand
by
the
fire
no
indeed
we
must
be
going
said
mamma
as
i
find
this
news
is
abroad
i
must
call
on
mrs
grey
she
will
take
offence
at
once
if
she
hears
it
from
anybody
but
me
so
much
for
people
husbands
being
partners
in
business
margaret
was
now
fully
qualified
to
comprehend
her
irritability
every
trifle
annoyed
her
the
rustle
of
mrs
handsome
cloak
almost
made
her
sick
and
she
thought
the
hall
clock
would
never
have
done
striking
twelve
when
conscious
of
this
she
put
a
strong
check
upon
herself
hester
stood
by
the
mantelpiece
looking
into
the
fire
and
taking
no
notice
of
their
mutual
silence
upon
this
piece
of
news
at
last
she
muttered
in
a
soliloquising
tone
do
not
know
but
i
am
not
sure
this
news
is
true
after
all
after
a
moment
pause
margaret
replied
i
think
that
is
not
very
reasonable
what
must
one
suppose
of
everybody
else
if
it
is
not
true
hester
was
going
to
say
what
must
we
think
of
him
if
it
is
but
she
checked
herself
she
should
not
have
said
what
she
had
she
felt
this
and
only
replied
just
so
yes
it
must
be
true
margaret
heart
once
more
sank
within
her
at
this
corroboration
of
her
own
remark
chapter
twenty
two
the
meadows
in
winter
hester
was
tired
of
her
before
she
saw
them
she
had
spent
more
trouble
on
them
than
they
were
worth
and
it
was
three
weeks
yet
before
they
came
it
was
now
past
the
middle
of
february
rather
late
in
the
season
for
to
arrive
but
then
there
was
consolatory
idea
that
they
would
be
ready
for
next
year
snow
it
is
not
too
late
yet
said
mr
hope
there
is
skating
every
day
in
the
meadow
it
will
soon
be
over
so
do
not
lose
your
opportunity
come
let
us
go
not
unless
the
sun
shines
out
said
hester
looking
with
a
shiver
up
at
the
windows
yes
said
edward
because
i
have
time
to
go
with
you
you
have
seen
me
quiz
other
skaters
you
must
go
and
see
other
skaters
quiz
me
what
points
of
your
skating
do
they
get
hold
of
to
quiz
asked
margaret
why
i
hardly
know
we
shall
see
is
it
so
very
good
then
no
i
believe
the
worst
of
my
skating
is
that
it
is
totally
devoid
of
every
sort
of
expression
that
is
just
the
true
account
of
it
he
continued
as
his
wife
laughed
i
do
not
square
my
elbows
nor
set
my
coat
flying
nor
stoop
nor
rear
but
neither
is
there
any
grace
i
just
go
straight
on
and
as
far
as
i
know
nobody
ever
bids
any
other
body
look
at
me
so
you
bid
your
own
family
come
and
look
at
you
but
how
are
your
neighbours
to
quiz
you
if
they
do
not
observe
you
oh
that
was
only
a
bit
of
antithesis
for
effect
my
last
account
is
the
true
one
as
you
will
see
i
shall
come
in
for
you
at
twelve
by
twelve
the
sun
had
shone
out
and
the
ladies
booted
furred
and
veiled
were
ready
to
encounter
the
risks
and
rigours
of
the
ice
and
snow
as
they
opened
the
hall
door
they
met
on
the
steps
a
young
woman
who
was
just
raising
her
hand
to
the
knocker
her
errand
was
soon
told
please
i
heard
that
you
wanted
a
servant
that
is
true
said
hester
where
do
you
come
from
from
any
place
near
so
that
you
can
call
again
surely
said
margaret
it
is
mrs
enderby
susan
yes
miss
i
have
been
living
with
mrs
enderby
mrs
enderby
will
give
me
a
good
character
why
are
you
leaving
her
susan
oh
only
because
she
is
gone
gone
where
what
do
you
mean
gone
to
live
at
mrs
rowland
you
did
know
it
very
sudden
but
she
moved
yesterday
and
we
were
paid
off
except
phoebe
who
stays
to
wait
upon
her
i
am
left
in
charge
of
the
house
so
i
can
step
here
again
if
you
wish
it
some
time
when
you
are
not
going
out
do
so
any
time
this
evening
or
before
noon
did
you
know
of
this
edward
said
his
wife
as
they
turned
the
corner
not
i
think
mrs
rowland
is
mistaken
in
saying
that
nothing
can
be
kept
secret
in
deerbrook
i
do
not
believe
anybody
has
dreamed
of
the
poor
old
lady
giving
up
her
house
very
likely
mrs
rowland
never
dreamed
of
it
herself
till
the
day
it
was
done
observed
margaret
oh
yes
she
did
said
mr
hope
i
understand
now
the
old
agitation
and
the
expressions
she
dropped
about
times
nearly
a
month
ago
that
was
the
last
time
you
saw
her
was
it
not
yes
the
next
day
when
i
called
i
was
told
that
she
was
better
and
that
she
would
send
when
she
wished
to
see
me
again
to
save
me
the
trouble
of
calling
when
she
might
be
asleep
she
has
been
asleep
or
engaged
every
time
i
have
inquired
at
the
door
of
late
observed
margaret
i
hope
she
is
doing
nothing
but
what
she
likes
in
this
change
of
plan
i
believe
she
finds
most
peace
and
quiet
in
doing
what
her
daughter
likes
said
mr
hope
here
margaret
where
are
you
going
this
is
the
gate
i
believe
you
have
not
learned
your
way
about
yet
i
will
follow
you
immediately
said
margaret
i
will
only
go
a
few
steps
to
see
if
this
can
really
be
true
before
the
hopes
had
half
crossed
the
meadow
margaret
joined
them
perfectly
convinced
the
large
bills
in
the
closed
windows
of
mrs
enderby
house
bore
to
be
let
or
sold
too
plainly
to
leave
any
doubt
as
the
skating
season
was
nearly
over
all
the
skaters
in
deerbrook
were
eager
to
make
use
of
their
remaining
opportunities
and
the
banks
of
the
brook
and
of
the
river
were
full
of
their
wives
sisters
and
children
sydney
grey
was
busy
cutting
before
the
eyes
of
his
sisters
and
in
defiance
of
his
mother
careful
warnings
not
to
go
here
and
not
to
venture
there
and
not
to
attempt
to
cross
the
river
mr
hope
begged
his
wife
to
engage
mrs
grey
in
conversation
so
that
sydney
might
be
left
free
for
a
while
and
promised
to
keep
near
the
boy
for
half
an
hour
during
which
time
mrs
grey
might
amuse
herself
with
watching
other
and
better
performers
further
on
as
might
have
been
foreseen
however
mrs
grey
could
talk
of
nothing
but
mrs
removal
of
which
she
had
not
been
informed
till
this
morning
and
which
she
had
intended
to
discuss
in
hester
house
on
leaving
the
meadows
it
appeared
that
mrs
enderby
had
been
in
agitated
and
variable
spirits
for
some
time
apparently
wishing
to
say
something
that
she
did
not
say
and
expressing
a
stronger
regard
than
ever
for
her
old
friends
a
regular
sign
that
some
act
of
tyranny
or
rudeness
might
speedily
be
expected
from
mrs
rowland
the
greys
were
in
the
midst
of
their
speculations
as
to
what
might
be
coming
to
pass
when
sydney
burst
in
with
the
news
that
mrs
enderby
house
was
to
be
let
or
sold
mrs
grey
had
mounted
her
spectacles
first
to
verify
the
fact
and
then
sent
alice
over
to
inquire
and
had
immediately
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
called
on
her
old
friend
at
mrs
rowland
she
had
been
told
at
the
door
that
mrs
enderby
was
too
much
fatigued
with
her
removal
to
see
any
visitors
so
i
shall
try
again
concluded
mrs
grey
how
does
mr
hope
think
her
spasms
have
been
lately
asked
sophia
he
has
not
seen
her
for
nearly
a
month
so
i
suppose
they
are
better
i
fear
that
does
not
follow
my
dear
said
mrs
grey
winking
some
people
are
afraid
of
your
husband
politics
you
are
aware
and
i
know
mrs
rowland
has
been
saying
and
doing
things
on
that
score
which
you
had
better
not
hear
about
i
have
my
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
old
lady
spasms
are
far
from
being
better
but
mrs
rowland
has
been
so
busy
crying
up
those
drops
of
hers
that
cure
everything
and
praising
her
maid
that
i
have
a
great
idea
your
husband
will
not
be
admitted
to
see
her
till
she
is
past
cure
and
her
daughter
thoroughly
frightened
mr
hope
has
never
been
forgiven
you
know
for
marrying
into
our
connection
so
decidedly
and
i
really
do
know
what
would
have
been
the
consequence
if
as
we
once
fancied
likely
mr
philip
and
margaret
had
thought
of
each
other
margaret
was
happily
out
of
hearing
a
fresh
blow
had
just
been
struck
she
had
looked
to
mrs
enderby
for
information
on
the
subject
which
for
ever
occupied
her
and
on
which
she
felt
that
she
must
know
more
or
sink
she
had
been
much
disappointed
at
being
refused
admission
to
the
old
lady
time
after
time
now
all
hope
of
free
access
and
private
conversation
was
over
she
had
set
it
as
an
object
before
her
to
see
mrs
enderby
and
learn
as
much
of
philip
affair
as
his
mother
chose
to
offer
now
this
object
was
lost
and
nothing
remained
to
be
done
or
hoped
for
it
was
too
certain
that
mrs
enderby
friends
would
not
be
allowed
unrestrained
intercourse
with
her
in
her
daughter
house
for
some
little
time
margaret
had
been
practising
the
device
so
familiar
to
the
unhappy
of
carrying
off
mental
agitation
by
bodily
exertion
she
was
now
eager
to
be
doing
something
more
active
than
walking
by
mrs
grey
side
listening
to
ideas
which
she
knew
just
as
well
without
their
being
spoken
mrs
grey
thoughts
about
mrs
rowland
and
mrs
rowland
ideas
of
mrs
grey
might
always
be
anticipated
by
those
who
knew
the
ladies
hester
and
margaret
had
learned
to
think
of
something
else
while
this
sort
of
comment
was
proceeding
and
to
resume
their
attention
when
it
came
to
an
end
margaret
had
withdrawn
from
it
now
and
was
upon
the
ice
with
sydney
why
cousin
margaret
you
do
mean
that
you
are
afraid
of
walking
on
the
ice
cried
sydney
balancing
himself
on
his
heels
mr
hope
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
called
out
as
hope
skimmed
past
them
cousin
margaret
is
afraid
of
going
on
the
ice
what
does
she
think
can
happen
to
her
asked
mr
hope
his
last
words
vanishing
in
the
distance
it
looks
so
grey
and
clear
and
dark
sydney
pooh
it
is
thick
enough
between
you
and
the
water
you
would
have
to
get
down
a
good
way
i
can
tell
you
before
you
could
get
drowned
but
it
is
so
slippery
what
of
that
what
else
did
you
expect
with
ice
if
you
tumble
you
can
get
up
again
i
have
been
down
three
times
this
morning
well
that
is
a
great
consolation
certainly
which
way
do
you
want
me
to
walk
oh
any
way
across
the
river
to
the
other
bank
if
you
like
you
will
remember
next
summer
when
we
come
this
way
in
a
boat
that
you
have
walked
across
the
very
place
that
is
true
said
margaret
i
will
go
if
sophia
will
go
with
me
there
is
no
use
in
asking
any
of
them
said
sydney
they
stand
dawdling
and
looking
till
their
lips
and
noses
are
all
blue
and
red
and
they
are
never
up
to
any
fun
i
will
try
as
far
as
that
pole
first
said
margaret
i
should
not
care
if
they
had
not
swept
away
all
the
snow
here
so
as
to
make
the
ice
look
so
grey
and
slippery
that
pole
said
sydney
why
that
pole
is
put
up
on
purpose
to
show
that
you
must
not
go
there
do
you
see
how
the
ice
is
broken
all
round
it
oh
i
know
how
it
is
that
you
are
so
stupid
and
cowardly
you
lived
in
birmingham
all
your
winters
and
you
never
been
used
to
walk
on
the
ice
i
am
glad
you
have
found
that
out
at
last
now
look
i
am
really
going
what
a
horrid
sensation
she
cried
as
she
cautiously
put
down
one
foot
before
the
other
on
the
transparent
floor
she
did
better
when
she
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
where
the
ice
had
been
ground
by
the
skates
now
you
would
get
on
beautifully
said
sydney
if
you
would
not
look
at
your
feet
why
ca
you
look
at
the
people
and
the
trees
opposite
suppose
i
should
step
into
a
hole
there
are
no
holes
trust
me
for
the
holes
what
do
you
flinch
so
for
the
ice
always
cracks
so
in
one
part
or
another
i
thought
you
had
been
shot
so
did
i
said
she
laughing
but
sydney
we
are
a
long
way
from
both
banks
to
be
sure
that
is
what
we
came
for
margaret
looked
somewhat
timidly
about
her
an
indistinct
idea
flitted
through
her
mind
how
glad
she
should
be
to
be
accidentally
innocently
drowned
and
scarcely
recognising
it
she
proceeded
you
get
on
well
shouted
mr
hope
as
he
flew
past
on
his
return
up
the
river
there
now
said
sydney
presently
it
is
a
very
little
way
to
the
bank
i
will
just
take
a
trip
up
and
down
and
come
for
you
again
to
go
back
and
then
we
will
try
whether
we
ca
get
cousin
hester
over
when
she
sees
you
have
been
safe
there
and
back
this
was
a
sight
which
hester
was
not
destined
to
behold
margaret
had
an
ignorant
partiality
for
the
ice
which
was
the
least
grey
and
when
left
to
herself
she
made
for
a
part
which
looked
less
like
glass
nobody
particularly
heeded
her
she
slipped
and
recovered
herself
she
slipped
again
and
fell
hearing
the
ice
crack
under
her
every
time
she
attempted
to
rise
she
found
the
place
too
slippery
to
keep
her
feet
next
there
was
a
hole
under
her
she
felt
the
cold
water
she
was
sinking
through
she
caught
at
the
surrounding
edges
they
broke
away
there
was
a
cry
from
the
bank
just
as
the
waters
seemed
to
close
all
round
her
and
she
felt
the
ice
like
a
heavy
weight
above
her
one
thought
of
joy
it
will
soon
be
all
over
now
was
the
only
experience
she
was
conscious
of
in
two
minutes
more
she
was
breathing
the
air
again
sitting
on
the
bank
and
helping
to
wring
out
her
clothes
how
much
may
pass
in
two
minutes
mr
hope
was
coming
up
the
river
again
when
he
saw
a
bustle
on
the
bank
and
slipped
off
his
skates
to
be
ready
to
be
of
service
he
ran
as
others
ran
and
arrived
just
when
a
dress
was
emerging
from
the
water
and
then
a
dripping
fur
tippet
and
then
the
bonnet
making
the
gradual
revelation
to
him
who
it
was
for
one
instant
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
an
expression
of
agony
so
intense
that
a
bystander
who
saw
it
said
take
comfort
sir
she
has
been
in
but
a
very
short
time
she
recover
i
do
doubt
hope
leaped
to
the
bank
and
received
her
from
the
arms
of
the
men
who
had
drawn
her
out
the
first
thing
she
remembered
was
hearing
in
the
lowest
tone
she
could
conceive
of
oh
god
my
margaret
and
a
groan
which
she
felt
rather
than
heard
then
there
were
many
warm
and
busy
hands
about
her
head
removing
her
bonnet
shaking
out
her
hair
and
chafing
her
temples
she
sighed
out
oh
dear
and
she
heard
that
soft
groan
again
in
another
moment
she
roused
herself
sat
up
saw
hope
convulsed
countenance
and
sydney
standing
motionless
and
deadly
pale
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
she
heard
her
brother
exclaim
oh
i
am
very
well
said
she
remembering
all
about
it
the
air
feels
quite
warm
give
me
my
bonnet
i
can
walk
home
can
you
the
sooner
the
better
then
said
hope
raising
her
she
could
stand
very
well
but
the
water
was
everywhere
dripping
from
her
clothes
many
bystanders
employed
themselves
in
wringing
them
out
and
in
the
meanwhile
margaret
inquired
for
her
sister
and
hoped
she
did
not
know
of
the
accident
hester
did
not
know
of
it
for
margaret
happened
to
be
the
first
to
think
of
any
one
but
herself
sydney
was
flying
off
to
report
when
he
was
stopped
and
recalled
you
must
go
to
her
edward
said
margaret
or
she
will
be
frightened
you
can
do
me
no
good
sydney
will
go
home
with
me
or
any
one
here
i
am
sure
twenty
people
stepped
forward
at
the
word
margaret
parted
with
her
heavy
fur
tippet
accepted
a
long
cloth
cloak
from
a
poor
woman
to
throw
over
her
wet
clothes
selected
mr
jones
the
butcher
for
her
escort
sent
sydney
forward
with
directions
to
morris
to
warm
her
bed
and
then
she
set
forth
homeward
mr
hope
and
half
a
dozen
more
would
see
her
across
the
ice
and
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
other
bank
she
was
able
to
walk
very
much
as
if
nothing
had
happened
mr
hope
had
perfectly
recovered
his
composure
before
he
reached
the
somewhat
distant
pond
where
hester
and
the
greys
were
watching
sliding
as
good
as
could
be
seen
within
twenty
miles
it
had
reached
perfection
like
everything
else
in
deerbrook
what
tired
already
said
hester
to
her
husband
what
have
you
done
with
your
skates
oh
i
have
left
them
somewhere
there
i
suppose
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
own
come
my
dear
let
us
go
home
margaret
is
gone
gone
why
is
not
she
well
it
is
not
so
very
cold
she
has
got
wet
and
she
has
gone
home
to
warm
herself
hester
did
not
wait
to
speak
again
to
the
greys
when
she
comprehended
that
her
sister
had
been
in
the
river
her
husband
was
obliged
to
forbid
her
walking
so
fast
and
assured
her
all
the
way
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
hester
reproached
him
for
his
coolness
you
need
not
reproach
me
said
he
i
shall
never
cease
to
reproach
myself
for
letting
her
go
where
she
did
and
yet
his
heart
told
him
that
he
had
only
acted
according
to
his
deliberate
design
of
keeping
aloof
from
all
margaret
pursuits
and
amusements
that
were
not
shared
with
her
sister
and
as
for
the
risk
he
had
seen
fifty
people
walking
across
the
ice
this
very
morning
judging
by
the
event
however
he
very
sincerely
declared
that
he
should
never
forgive
himself
for
having
left
her
when
they
reached
home
margaret
was
quite
warm
and
comfortable
and
her
hair
drying
rapidly
under
morris
hands
hester
was
convinced
that
everybody
might
dine
as
usual
margaret
herself
came
to
tea
and
the
only
consequence
of
the
accident
seemed
to
be
that
charles
was
kept
very
busy
opening
the
door
to
inquirers
how
miss
ibbotson
was
this
evening
it
made
hope
uneasy
to
perceive
how
much
margaret
remembered
of
what
had
passed
around
her
in
the
midst
of
the
bustle
of
the
morning
if
she
was
still
aware
of
some
circumstances
that
she
mentioned
might
she
not
retain
others
the
words
extorted
from
him
the
frantic
action
which
he
now
blushed
to
remember
brother
said
she
what
the
meaning
of
something
that
i
heard
some
one
say
just
as
i
sat
up
on
the
bank
a
baulk
for
the
doctor
he
is
baulked
of
a
body
in
his
own
house
oh
margaret
cried
her
sister
who
sat
looking
at
her
all
the
evening
as
if
they
had
been
parted
for
ten
years
you
dreamed
that
it
was
a
fancy
think
what
a
state
your
poor
head
was
in
it
may
have
a
few
strange
imaginations
left
in
it
still
may
it
not
edward
this
is
not
one
he
replied
she
heard
very
accurately
what
did
they
mean
there
is
a
report
abroad
about
me
arising
out
of
the
old
prejudice
about
dissection
some
of
my
neighbours
think
that
dissecting
is
the
employment
and
the
passion
of
my
life
and
that
i
rob
the
churchyard
as
often
as
anybody
is
buried
oh
edward
how
frightful
how
ridiculous
it
is
very
disagreeable
my
dear
i
am
taunted
with
this
wherever
i
go
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
wait
till
the
prejudices
against
me
die
out
but
i
see
that
we
shall
have
to
wait
some
time
for
before
one
suspicion
is
given
up
another
rises
since
that
unhappy
election
said
hester
sighing
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
that
men
like
you
should
be
no
better
treated
here
is
mrs
enderby
taken
out
of
your
hands
and
your
neighbours
suspecting
and
slandering
you
whose
commonest
words
they
are
not
worthy
to
repeat
my
dear
hester
said
he
in
a
tone
of
serious
remonstrance
that
is
rather
a
way
of
putting
the
case
to
be
sure
said
margaret
smiling
but
in
as
far
as
it
is
true
the
matter
surely
ceases
to
be
strange
good
men
do
not
come
into
the
world
to
be
what
the
world
calls
fortunate
but
to
be
something
far
better
the
best
men
do
not
use
the
means
to
be
rich
to
be
praised
by
their
neighbours
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
trouble
and
if
they
will
not
use
the
means
it
does
not
become
them
nor
their
wives
to
be
discouraged
at
losing
their
occupation
or
being
slandered
or
suspected
as
dangerous
people
edward
smile
thanked
her
and
so
did
her
sister
kiss
but
hester
looked
grave
again
when
she
said
i
suppose
we
shall
know
sooner
or
later
why
it
is
that
good
people
are
not
to
be
happy
here
and
that
the
more
they
love
one
another
the
more
struggles
and
sorrows
they
have
to
undergo
do
we
not
know
something
of
it
already
said
hope
after
a
pretty
long
pause
is
it
not
to
put
us
off
from
the
too
vehement
desire
of
being
what
we
commonly
call
happy
by
the
time
higher
things
become
more
interesting
to
us
than
this
we
begin
to
find
that
it
is
given
to
us
to
put
our
own
happiness
under
our
feet
in
reaching
forward
to
something
better
we
become
by
natural
consequence
practised
in
this
forgetful
of
the
things
that
are
behind
and
if
the
practice
be
painful
what
then
we
shall
not
quarrel
with
it
surely
unless
we
are
willing
to
exchange
what
we
have
gained
for
money
and
praise
and
animal
spirits
shutting
in
an
abject
mind
oh
no
no
said
hester
but
yet
there
are
troubles
she
stopped
short
on
observing
margaret
quivering
lip
there
are
troubles
i
own
which
it
is
difficult
to
classify
and
interpret
said
her
husband
we
can
only
struggle
through
them
taking
the
closest
heed
to
our
innocence
but
these
affairs
of
ours
these
mistakes
of
my
neighbours
are
not
of
that
sort
they
are
intelligible
enough
and
need
not
therefore
trouble
us
much
hope
was
right
in
his
suspicion
of
the
accuracy
of
margaret
memory
his
tones
his
words
had
sunk
deep
into
her
heart
her
innocent
heart
in
which
everything
that
entered
it
became
safe
and
pure
as
itself
oh
god
my
margaret
sounded
there
like
music
what
a
heart
he
has
she
thought
i
was
very
selfish
to
fancy
him
reserved
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
my
brother
loves
me
so
if
it
is
such
a
blessing
to
be
his
sister
how
happy
must
hester
be
in
spite
of
everything
god
has
preserved
my
life
and
he
has
given
these
two
to
each
other
and
oh
how
he
has
shown
me
that
they
love
me
i
will
rouse
myself
and
try
to
suffer
less
chapter
twenty
three
moods
of
the
mind
hester
sleeping
as
well
as
waking
thoughts
were
this
night
full
of
solicitude
as
to
her
feelings
and
conduct
towards
her
sister
a
thousand
times
before
the
morning
she
had
said
to
herself
in
dreams
and
in
meditation
that
she
had
failed
in
this
relation
the
oldest
and
till
of
late
the
dearest
she
shuddered
to
think
how
nearly
she
had
lost
margaret
and
to
imagine
what
her
state
of
mind
would
have
been
if
her
sister
had
now
been
beyond
the
reach
of
the
voice
the
eye
the
hand
which
she
was
resolved
should
henceforth
dispense
to
her
nothing
but
the
love
and
the
benefits
she
deserved
she
reflected
that
to
few
was
granted
such
a
warning
of
the
death
of
beloved
ones
to
few
was
it
permitted
to
feel
while
it
was
yet
not
too
late
the
agony
of
remorse
for
pain
inflicted
for
gratifications
withheld
for
selfish
neglect
for
insufficient
love
she
remembered
vividly
what
her
emotions
had
been
as
a
child
on
finding
her
canary
dead
in
its
cage
how
she
had
wept
all
day
not
so
much
for
its
loss
as
from
the
recollection
of
the
many
times
when
she
had
failed
to
cheer
it
with
sugar
and
groundsel
and
play
and
of
the
number
of
hours
when
she
had
needlessly
covered
up
its
cage
in
impatience
at
its
song
shutting
out
its
sunshine
and
changing
the
brightest
seasons
of
its
little
life
into
dull
night
if
it
had
been
thus
with
her
sister
many
a
hasty
word
many
an
unjust
thought
came
back
now
to
wring
her
heart
when
she
imagined
margaret
sinking
in
the
water
the
soft
breathing
on
which
our
life
so
marvellously
hangs
stopped
without
struggle
or
cry
how
near
how
very
near
had
death
in
his
hovering
stooped
towards
their
home
how
strange
while
treading
thus
precariously
the
film
which
covers
the
abyss
into
which
all
must
some
day
drop
and
which
may
crack
under
the
feet
of
any
one
at
any
hour
how
strange
to
be
engrossed
with
petty
jealousies
with
selfish
cares
and
to
be
unmindful
of
the
great
interests
of
existence
the
exercises
of
mutual
love
and
trust
thank
god
it
was
not
too
late
margaret
lived
to
be
cherished
to
be
consoled
for
her
private
griefs
as
far
as
consolation
might
be
possible
to
have
her
innocent
affections
redeemed
from
the
waste
to
which
they
now
seemed
doomed
gathered
gradually
up
again
and
knit
into
the
interests
of
the
home
life
in
which
she
was
externally
bearing
her
part
full
of
these
thoughts
and
forgetting
how
often
her
best
feelings
had
melted
away
beneath
the
transient
heats
kindled
by
the
little
provocations
of
daily
life
hester
now
believed
that
margaret
would
never
have
to
suffer
from
her
more
that
their
love
would
be
henceforth
like
that
of
angels
like
that
which
it
would
have
been
if
margaret
had
really
died
yesterday
it
was
yet
early
when
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
undoubting
thoughts
hester
stood
by
her
bedside
margaret
was
still
sleeping
but
with
that
expression
of
weariness
in
her
face
which
had
of
late
become
too
common
hester
gazed
long
at
the
countenance
grieving
at
the
languor
and
anxiety
which
it
revealed
she
had
not
taken
margaret
suffering
to
heart
she
had
been
unfeeling
strangely
forgetful
she
would
minister
to
her
now
with
reverent
care
as
she
thus
resolved
she
bent
down
and
kissed
her
forehead
margaret
started
shook
off
sleep
felt
quite
well
would
rise
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
rise
at
once
when
she
entered
the
hester
was
there
placing
her
chair
by
the
fire
and
inventing
indulgences
for
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
invalid
it
was
in
vain
that
margaret
protested
that
no
effects
of
the
accident
remained
not
a
single
sensation
of
chill
she
was
to
be
taken
care
of
and
she
submitted
she
was
touched
by
her
sister
gentle
offices
and
felt
more
like
being
free
and
at
peace
more
like
being
lifted
up
out
of
her
woe
than
she
had
yet
done
since
the
fatal
hour
which
rendered
her
conscious
and
wretched
breakfast
went
on
cheerfully
the
fire
blazed
bright
the
rain
pelting
against
the
windows
gave
welcome
promise
of
exemption
from
inquiries
in
person
and
from
having
to
relate
many
times
over
the
particulars
of
the
event
of
yesterday
hester
was
beautiful
in
all
the
glow
of
her
sensibilities
and
edward
was
for
this
morning
in
no
hurry
no
blue
or
yellow
backed
pamphlet
lay
beside
his
plate
and
when
his
last
cup
was
empty
he
still
sat
talking
as
if
he
forgot
that
he
should
have
to
go
out
in
the
rain
in
the
midst
of
a
laugh
which
had
prevented
their
hearing
a
premonitory
knock
the
door
opened
and
mrs
grey
twin
daughters
entered
looking
never
before
had
they
been
known
to
come
out
in
heavy
rain
but
they
were
so
very
desirous
to
see
cousin
margaret
after
she
had
been
in
the
water
and
sydney
had
held
the
great
gig
umbrella
over
himself
and
them
as
papa
would
not
hear
of
sydney
not
coming
he
was
standing
outside
the
door
now
under
the
large
umbrella
for
he
said
nothing
should
make
him
come
in
and
see
cousin
margaret
he
would
never
see
her
again
if
he
could
help
it
sydney
had
said
another
thing
such
a
wicked
thing
mamma
was
quite
ashamed
of
him
mr
hope
thought
they
had
better
not
repeat
anything
wicked
that
any
one
had
said
but
hester
considered
it
possible
that
it
might
not
appear
so
wicked
if
spoken
as
if
left
to
the
imagination
what
sydney
had
said
was
that
if
cousin
margaret
had
been
really
drowned
he
would
have
drowned
himself
before
mary
added
that
she
heard
him
mutter
that
he
was
almost
ready
to
do
it
now
mr
hope
thought
that
must
be
the
reason
why
he
was
standing
out
at
present
to
catch
all
this
rain
which
was
very
nearly
enough
to
drown
anybody
and
he
went
to
bring
him
in
but
sydney
was
not
to
be
caught
he
was
on
the
watch
and
the
moment
he
saw
mr
coat
instead
of
his
sisters
cloaks
he
ran
off
with
a
speed
which
defied
pursuit
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
with
the
large
umbrella
his
cousins
were
sorry
that
he
felt
the
event
so
painfully
and
that
he
could
not
come
in
and
confide
his
trouble
of
mind
to
them
hope
resolved
not
to
let
the
morning
pass
without
seeing
him
and
if
possible
bringing
him
home
to
dinner
with
william
levitt
to
take
off
the
awkwardness
what
are
we
to
do
exclaimed
sydney
little
sisters
he
has
carried
off
the
great
umbrella
i
can
not
conveniently
send
you
just
at
present
said
hester
so
you
had
better
put
off
your
cloaks
and
amuse
yourselves
here
till
the
rain
abates
or
some
one
comes
for
you
we
will
speak
to
miss
young
to
excuse
your
not
being
with
her
oh
cousin
margaret
said
the
children
if
you
will
speak
to
miss
young
she
will
give
us
any
sort
of
a
holiday
she
minds
everything
you
say
she
will
let
us
stop
all
day
and
dine
here
if
you
ask
her
hester
said
she
could
not
have
them
stay
all
day
she
did
not
mean
to
have
them
to
dinner
and
the
little
girls
both
looked
up
in
her
face
at
once
to
find
out
what
made
her
speak
so
angrily
they
saw
cousin
margaret
glancing
the
same
way
too
do
you
know
mary
said
fanny
you
have
not
said
a
word
yet
of
what
miss
young
bade
you
say
mary
told
cousin
margaret
that
miss
young
was
wishing
very
much
to
see
her
and
would
be
pleased
if
margaret
would
mention
what
evening
she
would
spend
with
her
a
nice
long
evening
mary
added
to
begin
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
and
on
till
nobody
knew
when
maria
had
better
come
here
observed
hester
quickly
and
then
some
one
else
besides
margaret
may
have
the
benefit
of
her
conversation
she
seems
to
forget
that
anybody
cares
for
her
besides
margaret
tell
miss
young
she
had
better
fix
an
evening
to
come
here
i
do
not
think
she
will
do
that
said
both
the
little
girls
why
not
she
is
very
lame
now
replied
mary
and
she
can
not
walk
further
than
just
to
school
and
back
again
and
besides
remarked
fanny
she
wants
to
talk
with
cousin
margaret
alone
i
am
sure
they
have
such
a
great
deal
of
talk
to
do
whenever
they
are
together
we
watch
them
sometimes
in
the
schoolroom
through
the
window
when
we
are
at
play
in
the
garden
and
their
heads
nod
at
one
another
in
this
way
i
believe
they
never
leave
off
for
a
minute
we
often
wonder
what
it
can
be
all
about
ah
my
dears
you
and
i
had
better
not
ask
said
hester
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
better
that
we
should
not
know
margaret
looked
beseechingly
at
her
sister
hester
replied
to
her
look
i
mean
what
i
say
margaret
you
can
not
but
be
aware
how
much
more
you
have
to
communicate
to
maria
than
to
me
our
conversation
soon
comes
to
a
stand
and
i
must
say
i
have
had
much
occasion
to
admire
your
great
talent
for
silence
of
late
maria
has
still
to
learn
your
accomplishments
in
that
direction
i
fancy
margaret
quietly
told
the
little
girls
that
she
would
write
a
note
to
maria
with
her
answer
you
must
not
do
that
said
fanny
miss
young
said
you
must
not
that
was
the
reason
why
she
sent
you
a
message
instead
of
a
note
that
you
might
not
have
to
write
back
again
when
a
message
would
do
as
well
margaret
nevertheless
sat
down
at
the
you
go
of
course
said
hester
in
the
voice
of
forced
calmness
which
margaret
knew
so
well
the
little
girls
may
as
well
stay
and
dine
after
all
as
i
shall
otherwise
be
alone
in
the
evening
i
shall
not
go
said
margaret
without
turning
her
head
you
will
not
stay
away
on
my
account
of
course
i
have
said
that
i
shall
go
on
thursday
thursday
that
is
almost
a
week
hence
now
margaret
do
not
be
pettish
and
deny
yourself
what
you
know
you
like
best
do
not
be
a
baby
and
quarrel
with
your
supper
i
had
far
rather
you
should
go
and
have
done
with
it
than
that
you
should
wait
till
thursday
thinking
all
day
long
till
then
that
you
are
obliging
me
by
staying
with
me
i
can
not
bear
that
i
wish
i
knew
what
you
could
bear
said
margaret
in
a
voice
which
the
children
could
not
hear
i
wish
i
knew
how
i
could
save
you
pain
the
moment
the
words
were
out
margaret
was
sorry
for
them
she
was
aware
that
the
best
kindness
to
her
sister
was
to
take
as
little
notice
as
possible
of
her
discontents
to
turn
the
conversation
to
avoid
scenes
or
any
remarks
which
could
bring
them
on
it
was
hard
sometimes
it
seemed
impossible
to
speak
calmly
and
lightly
while
every
pulse
was
throbbing
and
every
fibre
trembling
with
fear
and
wretchedness
but
yet
it
was
best
to
assume
such
calmness
and
lightness
margaret
now
asked
the
little
girls
while
she
sealed
her
note
how
their
patchwork
was
getting
on
thus
far
the
handsomest
patchwork
quilt
she
had
ever
seen
oh
it
will
be
far
handsomer
before
it
is
done
mrs
howell
has
found
up
some
beautiful
pieces
of
print
for
us
remnants
of
her
first
after
she
was
married
and
of
her
poor
dear
howell
last
as
she
says
we
were
quite
sorry
to
take
those
but
she
would
put
them
up
for
us
and
she
is
to
see
the
quilt
sometimes
in
return
but
miss
nares
parcel
was
the
best
cousin
margaret
such
a
quantity
of
nankeen
for
the
ground
and
the
loveliest
chintz
for
the
centre
medallion
is
not
it
mary
oh
lovely
do
you
know
cousin
margaret
miss
nares
and
miss
flint
both
cried
when
they
heard
how
nearly
you
were
drowned
i
am
sure
i
had
no
idea
they
would
have
cared
so
much
nor
i
my
dear
but
i
dare
say
they
feel
kindly
towards
anyone
saved
from
great
danger
not
everybody
said
fanny
only
you
because
you
are
a
great
favourite
everybody
says
you
are
a
great
favourite
papa
cried
last
night
just
a
little
tear
or
two
as
gentlemen
do
when
he
told
mamma
how
sorry
everybody
in
deerbrook
would
have
been
if
you
had
died
there
that
will
do
said
hester
struggling
between
her
better
and
worse
feelings
her
remorse
of
this
morning
and
her
present
jealousy
and
losing
her
temper
between
the
two
you
have
said
quite
enough
about
what
you
do
not
understand
my
dears
i
can
not
have
you
make
so
free
with
your
cousin
name
children
the
little
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
wonder
and
hester
thought
she
detected
a
lurking
smile
i
see
what
you
are
thinking
children
yes
look
the
rain
is
nearly
over
and
then
you
may
go
and
tell
mrs
howell
and
miss
nares
and
all
the
people
you
see
on
your
way
home
that
they
had
better
attend
to
their
own
concerns
than
pretend
to
understand
what
would
have
been
felt
if
your
cousin
had
been
drowned
i
wonder
at
their
impertinence
are
you
in
earnest
cousin
hester
shall
we
go
and
tell
them
so
no
she
is
not
in
earnest
said
margaret
but
before
you
go
morris
shall
give
you
some
pieces
for
your
quilt
some
very
pretty
ones
such
as
she
knows
i
can
spare
margaret
rang
and
morris
took
the
children
to
choose
for
themselves
out
of
margaret
drawer
of
pieces
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
margaret
said
sister
do
not
make
me
wish
that
i
had
died
under
the
ice
yesterday
margaret
how
dare
you
say
anything
so
wicked
if
it
be
wicked
god
forgive
me
i
was
wretched
enough
before
i
would
fain
have
never
come
to
life
again
and
now
you
almost
make
me
believe
that
you
would
have
been
best
pleased
if
i
never
had
at
this
moment
hope
entered
he
had
left
them
in
a
far
different
mood
it
made
him
breathless
to
see
his
wife
face
of
passion
and
of
woe
hear
her
exclaimed
hester
she
says
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
lost
her
yesterday
have
mercy
upon
me
cried
margaret
in
excessive
agitation
you
oppress
me
beyond
what
i
can
bear
i
can
not
bear
on
as
i
used
to
do
my
strength
is
gone
and
you
give
me
none
you
take
away
what
i
had
will
you
hear
me
spoken
to
in
this
way
cried
hester
turning
to
her
husband
i
will
margaret
emotion
prevented
her
hearing
this
or
caring
who
was
by
she
went
on
you
leave
me
nothing
nothing
but
yourself
and
you
abuse
my
love
for
you
you
warn
me
against
love
against
marriage
you
chill
my
very
soul
with
terror
at
it
i
have
found
a
friend
in
maria
and
you
poison
my
comfort
in
my
friendship
and
insult
my
friend
there
is
not
an
infant
in
a
neighbour
house
but
you
become
jealous
of
it
the
moment
i
take
it
in
my
arms
there
is
not
a
flower
in
your
garden
not
a
book
on
my
table
that
you
will
let
me
love
in
peace
how
ungenerous
while
you
have
one
to
cherish
and
who
cherishes
you
that
you
will
have
me
lonely
that
you
quarrel
with
all
who
show
regard
to
me
that
you
refuse
me
the
least
solace
when
my
heart
is
breaking
with
its
loneliness
oh
it
is
cruel
will
you
hear
this
edward
i
will
because
it
is
the
truth
for
once
hester
you
must
hear
another
mind
you
have
often
told
your
own
god
knows
why
i
was
saved
yesterday
murmured
margaret
for
a
more
desolate
creature
does
not
breathe
hope
leaned
against
the
wall
hester
relieved
her
torment
of
mind
with
reproaches
of
margaret
you
do
not
trust
me
she
cried
it
is
you
who
make
me
miserable
you
go
to
others
for
the
comfort
you
ought
to
seek
in
me
you
place
that
confidence
in
others
which
ought
to
be
mine
alone
you
are
cheered
when
you
learn
that
the
commonest
gossips
in
deerbrook
care
about
you
and
you
set
no
value
on
your
own
sister
feelings
for
you
you
have
faith
and
charity
for
people
out
of
doors
and
mistrust
and
misconstruction
for
those
at
home
i
am
the
injured
one
margaret
not
you
margaret
said
hope
your
sister
speaks
for
herself
i
think
that
you
are
the
injured
one
as
hester
herself
will
soon
agree
so
far
from
having
anything
to
reproach
you
with
i
honour
your
forbearance
unremitting
till
this
hour
i
mourn
that
we
can
not
if
we
would
console
you
in
return
but
whatever
i
can
do
shall
be
done
your
friendships
your
pursuits
shall
be
protected
if
we
persecute
your
affections
at
home
i
will
take
care
that
you
are
allowed
their
exercise
abroad
rely
upon
me
and
do
not
think
yourself
utterly
lonely
while
you
have
a
brother
i
have
been
very
selfish
said
margaret
recovering
herself
at
the
first
word
of
kindness
wretchedness
makes
me
selfish
i
think
she
raised
herself
up
on
the
sofa
and
timidly
held
out
her
hand
to
her
sister
hester
thrust
it
away
margaret
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
such
as
had
never
been
heard
from
her
since
her
childhood
hope
fell
on
the
floor
he
had
fainted
at
the
sound
even
now
there
was
no
one
but
morris
who
understood
it
margaret
reproached
herself
bitterly
for
her
selfishness
for
her
loss
of
the
power
of
hester
remorse
however
greater
in
degree
was
of
its
usual
kind
strong
and
brief
she
repeated
as
she
had
done
before
that
she
made
her
husband
wretched
that
she
should
never
have
another
happy
moment
that
she
wished
he
had
never
seen
her
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
was
humbled
contrite
convinced
that
she
should
give
way
to
her
temper
no
more
her
eyes
filled
when
her
husband
spoke
tenderly
to
her
and
her
conduct
to
margaret
was
one
act
of
supplication
but
a
lesser
degree
of
this
same
kind
of
penitence
had
produced
no
permanent
good
effect
before
and
there
was
no
security
that
the
present
paroxysm
would
have
a
different
result
morris
had
seen
that
the
children
were
engaged
when
she
came
down
at
margaret
silent
summons
to
help
to
revive
her
master
when
she
saw
that
there
had
been
distress
before
there
was
illness
she
took
her
part
she
resolved
that
no
one
but
herself
should
hear
his
first
words
and
sent
the
ladies
away
when
she
saw
that
his
consciousness
was
returning
all
the
world
might
have
heard
his
first
words
he
recovered
himself
with
a
vigorous
effort
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
and
within
a
few
minutes
was
examining
a
patient
in
the
there
the
little
girls
saw
him
as
they
passed
the
door
on
their
way
out
with
their
treasure
of
chintz
and
print
and
having
heard
some
bustle
below
they
carried
home
word
that
they
believed
mr
hope
had
been
doing
something
to
somebody
which
had
made
somebody
faint
and
sophia
shuddering
observed
how
horrid
it
must
be
to
be
a
wife
chapter
twenty
four
warnings
maria
young
lodging
at
the
farrier
had
one
advantage
over
many
better
dwellings
it
was
pleasanter
in
winter
than
in
summer
there
was
little
to
find
fault
with
in
the
tiny
after
candles
were
lighted
the
fire
burned
clear
in
the
grate
and
when
the
screen
was
up
there
were
no
draughts
this
screen
was
quite
a
modern
improvement
when
fanny
and
mary
grey
had
experienced
the
pleasure
of
surprising
sophia
with
a
token
of
sisterly
affection
in
the
shape
of
a
piece
of
and
their
mother
with
a
token
of
filial
affection
in
the
form
of
a
they
were
unwilling
to
stop
and
looked
round
to
see
whether
they
could
not
present
somebody
with
a
token
of
some
other
sort
of
affection
sophia
was
taken
into
their
counsels
and
she
being
aware
of
how
miss
young
candle
flared
when
the
wind
was
high
devised
this
screen
the
carpenter
made
the
frame
sydney
covered
it
with
canvas
and
black
paper
for
a
ground
and
the
little
girls
pasted
on
it
all
the
drawings
and
prints
they
could
muster
here
was
the
dargle
an
everlasting
waterfall
that
looked
always
the
same
in
the
print
there
was
morland
woodcutter
with
his
tall
figure
his
pipe
his
dog
and
his
faggot
with
the
snow
lying
all
around
him
two
or
three
cathedrals
were
interspersed
and
in
the
midst
of
them
and
larger
than
any
of
them
a
silhouette
of
mr
grey
with
the
eyelash
wonderfully
like
and
the
wart
upon
his
nose
not
to
be
mistaken
then
there
was
charles
the
first
taking
leave
of
his
family
and
on
either
side
of
this
an
evening
primrose
in
by
mary
and
a
head
of
terror
with
a
square
mouth
and
starting
eyes
in
crayon
by
fanny
mrs
grey
produced
some
gay
border
which
the
had
left
over
when
the
attics
were
last
furnished
and
sydney
cut
out
in
white
paper
a
huntsman
with
his
whip
in
the
air
a
fox
a
gate
and
two
hounds
mr
grey
pleaded
that
having
contributed
his
face
he
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
of
him
nevertheless
he
brought
home
one
day
on
his
return
from
market
a
beautiful
stream
of
time
which
made
the
children
dance
round
their
screen
it
was
settled
at
first
that
this
would
nobly
ornament
the
whole
of
one
side
but
it
popped
into
sydney
head
just
as
he
was
falling
asleep
one
night
how
pretty
it
would
be
to
stick
it
round
with
the
planets
so
the
planets
were
cut
out
in
white
and
shaded
with
indian
ink
there
was
no
mistaking
saturn
with
his
ring
or
jupiter
with
his
moons
at
length
all
was
done
and
the
cook
was
glad
to
hear
that
no
more
paste
would
be
wanted
and
the
little
girls
might
soon
leave
off
giggling
when
miss
young
asked
them
in
the
schoolroom
why
they
were
jogging
one
another
elbows
mr
grey
spared
one
of
his
men
to
deposit
the
precious
piece
of
handiwork
at
miss
young
lodging
and
there
when
she
went
home
one
cold
afternoon
she
found
the
screen
standing
between
the
fire
and
the
door
and
pinned
on
it
a
piece
of
paper
inscribed
a
token
of
friendly
affection
this
was
not
however
the
only
nor
the
first
gift
with
which
parlour
was
enriched
amidst
all
the
bustle
of
furnishing
the
house
margaret
had
found
time
to
plan
and
execute
a
for
her
friend
benefit
and
another
person
no
other
than
philip
enderby
had
sent
in
a
just
the
right
size
to
stand
between
the
fire
and
the
table
it
had
gone
hard
with
maria
to
accept
this
last
gift
but
his
nephew
and
nieces
were
philip
plea
of
excuse
for
the
act
and
this
plea
cut
her
off
from
refusing
though
in
her
heart
she
believed
that
neither
the
children
nor
ancient
regard
were
in
his
thoughts
when
he
did
it
but
rather
margaret
affection
for
her
for
some
time
this
was
a
couch
of
thorns
but
now
affairs
had
put
on
a
newer
aspect
still
and
maria
forgot
her
own
perplexities
and
troubles
in
sympathy
with
her
friend
there
was
nothing
to
quarrel
with
in
the
look
of
the
when
margaret
entered
maria
room
in
the
twilight
in
the
afternoon
of
the
appointed
thursday
reading
by
said
margaret
i
suppose
i
am
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
the
daylight
went
away
so
softly
six
i
declare
the
days
lengthening
as
we
say
every
year
but
we
will
have
something
better
than
firelight
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
set
those
candles
on
the
table
the
time
was
long
put
when
maria
thought
of
apologising
for
asking
her
friend
to
do
what
her
lameness
rendered
painful
to
herself
margaret
laid
aside
her
bonnet
and
cloak
behind
the
screen
lighted
the
candles
put
more
coals
on
the
fire
and
took
her
seat
not
beside
maria
but
in
a
goodly
armchair
which
she
drew
forward
from
its
recess
now
said
she
we
only
want
a
cat
to
be
purring
on
the
rug
to
make
us
a
complete
winter
picture
the
kettle
will
be
coming
soon
to
sing
on
the
hob
and
that
will
do
nearly
as
well
but
maria
i
wonder
have
no
cat
we
have
set
up
a
cat
i
think
i
will
send
you
a
kitten
some
day
as
a
token
of
neighbourly
affection
thank
you
do
you
know
i
was
positively
assured
lately
that
i
had
a
cat
i
said
all
i
could
in
proof
that
i
had
none
but
mrs
tucker
persisted
in
her
inquiries
after
its
health
notwithstanding
what
did
she
mean
she
said
she
saw
a
kitten
run
into
the
passage
and
that
it
never
came
out
again
so
that
it
followed
of
course
that
it
must
be
here
still
one
day
when
i
was
in
school
she
came
over
to
satisfy
herself
and
true
enough
there
had
been
a
kitten
the
poor
thing
jumped
from
the
passage
window
into
the
yard
and
went
to
see
what
they
were
about
at
the
forge
a
hot
fell
upon
its
back
and
it
mewed
so
dolefully
that
the
people
drowned
it
so
there
you
have
the
story
of
my
cat
as
it
was
told
to
me
thank
you
it
is
a
good
thing
to
know
but
what
does
mrs
grey
say
to
your
setting
up
a
cat
when
she
heard
mrs
tucker
first
inquiries
she
took
them
for
an
imputation
and
was
vexed
accordingly
young
said
she
must
be
mistaken
mrs
tucker
miss
young
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
kitten
oh
for
shame
said
margaret
laughing
but
what
is
the
annual
expense
of
a
kitten
can
you
tell
us
i
am
afraid
we
never
considered
that
why
there
is
the
breast
of
a
fowl
once
a
year
or
so
when
your
cook
forgets
to
shut
the
behind
her
cats
never
take
the
drumsticks
when
there
is
a
breast
you
are
aware
you
know
best
how
mr
hope
looks
when
the
drumsticks
and
side
bones
come
to
table
with
an
empty
space
in
the
middle
of
the
dish
where
the
breast
ought
to
have
been
i
will
tell
you
the
first
time
it
happens
and
margaret
sank
into
an
absent
fit
brought
on
by
the
bare
suggestion
of
discontent
at
home
hester
had
made
her
uncomfortable
the
last
thing
before
she
left
the
house
by
speaking
sharply
of
maria
without
any
fresh
provocation
undisciplined
still
by
what
had
happened
so
lately
she
had
wished
maria
young
a
hundred
miles
off
margaret
meditated
and
sighed
it
was
some
time
before
maria
spoke
when
she
did
she
said
margaret
do
not
you
think
people
had
better
not
persuade
themselves
and
their
very
intimate
friends
that
they
are
happy
when
they
are
not
they
had
better
not
think
even
in
their
own
innermost
minds
whether
they
are
happy
or
not
if
they
can
help
it
true
but
there
are
times
when
that
is
impossible
when
it
is
far
better
to
avoid
the
effort
come
i
suspect
we
may
relieve
each
other
just
now
by
allowing
the
truth
i
will
own
if
you
will
that
i
am
very
unhappy
never
mind
what
it
is
about
i
will
if
you
will
replied
margaret
faintly
smiling
there
now
that
right
we
shall
be
all
the
better
for
it
we
have
quite
enough
of
seeming
happy
god
knows
beyond
these
doors
we
can
talk
there
about
kittens
and
cold
fowl
here
we
will
not
talk
at
all
unless
we
like
and
we
will
each
groan
as
much
as
we
please
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
speak
so
said
margaret
tenderly
not
that
i
do
not
agree
with
you
i
think
it
is
a
terrible
mistake
to
fancy
that
it
is
religious
to
charm
away
grief
which
after
all
is
rejecting
it
before
it
has
done
its
work
and
as
for
concealing
it
there
must
be
very
good
reasons
indeed
for
that
to
save
it
from
being
hypocrisy
but
the
more
i
agree
with
you
the
more
sorry
i
am
to
hear
you
say
just
what
i
was
thinking
i
am
afraid
you
must
be
very
unhappy
maria
i
in
great
pain
and
i
do
not
find
that
pain
becomes
less
of
an
evil
by
one
being
used
to
it
indeed
i
think
the
reverse
happens
for
the
future
comes
into
the
consideration
do
you
expect
to
go
on
to
suffer
this
same
pain
can
nothing
cure
it
is
there
no
help
none
but
in
patience
there
are
intermissions
happily
and
pretty
long
ones
i
get
through
the
summer
very
well
but
the
end
of
the
winter
this
same
month
of
february
is
a
sad
aching
time
and
so
it
must
be
for
as
many
winters
as
i
may
have
to
live
but
i
am
better
off
than
i
was
last
february
i
did
not
know
you
oh
margaret
if
they
had
not
brought
you
up
from
under
the
ice
the
other
day
how
different
would
all
have
been
how
strange
it
seems
to
think
of
the
difference
that
hung
on
that
one
act
said
margaret
shivering
again
at
the
remembrance
of
her
icy
prison
what
and
where
should
i
have
been
now
and
what
would
have
been
the
change
in
this
little
world
of
ours
you
would
have
missed
me
i
know
and
on
that
account
i
am
glad
it
ended
as
it
did
and
on
no
other
asked
maria
looking
earnestly
at
her
friend
my
sister
would
have
grieved
sadly
at
first
you
do
not
know
what
care
she
takes
of
me
how
often
she
is
thinking
of
my
comfort
and
edward
is
fond
of
me
too
i
know
he
is
but
they
live
for
each
other
and
could
spare
every
one
else
you
and
morris
would
have
been
my
mourners
and
you
two
are
enough
to
live
for
to
say
nothing
of
others
who
may
arise
i
hope
nothing
more
will
arise
in
my
life
maria
i
want
no
change
i
have
had
enough
of
it
you
think
so
now
i
understand
your
feeling
very
well
but
yet
i
can
fancy
that
when
you
are
twice
as
old
as
you
are
when
a
few
grey
hairs
peep
out
among
all
that
brown
when
this
plump
little
hand
grows
thin
and
that
girlish
figure
of
yours
looks
dignified
and
and
people
say
that
nobody
thought
when
you
were
young
that
you
would
turn
out
a
handsome
woman
i
can
fancy
that
when
all
this
has
happened
you
may
be
more
disposed
to
look
forward
and
less
disinclined
to
change
than
you
feel
at
this
moment
but
there
is
no
use
in
saying
so
now
you
shake
your
head
and
i
nod
mine
you
say
and
i
say
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
where
will
you
be
then
i
wonder
i
do
not
wish
to
know
nor
even
to
inquire
of
my
own
judgment
my
health
is
very
bad
worse
than
you
are
aware
of
i
can
not
expect
to
be
able
to
work
always
some
of
my
present
pupils
are
growing
very
tall
and
no
strangers
will
take
me
if
i
do
not
get
much
better
which
is
i
believe
impossible
the
future
therefore
is
all
a
mystery
and
so
let
it
remain
i
am
not
anxious
about
that
but
i
am
here
comes
tea
now
you
will
be
doing
a
finer
thing
in
making
us
a
good
cup
of
tea
than
in
settling
my
future
ever
so
satisfactorily
seeing
that
you
can
not
touch
it
with
so
much
as
your
little
finger
the
tea
is
wholly
in
your
power
you
look
forward
to
other
people
grey
hair
and
sedateness
of
face
though
you
will
not
to
your
own
mere
grey
hair
is
as
certain
as
futurity
itself
and
i
will
allow
you
to
prophesy
that
much
for
me
or
for
anybody
why
should
we
not
prophesy
about
your
pupils
too
they
seem
to
be
improving
very
much
they
certainly
are
and
i
am
glad
you
have
lighted
upon
the
pleasantest
subject
i
ever
think
about
oh
margaret
you
do
not
know
what
encouragement
i
have
about
some
of
those
children
their
lot
is
and
will
be
a
hard
one
in
many
respects
it
will
be
difficult
for
them
to
grow
kindly
and
liberal
and
truthful
with
such
examples
as
they
have
before
their
eyes
they
advance
like
the
snail
on
the
wall
creeping
three
inches
on
in
the
day
and
falling
back
two
at
night
they
get
out
of
a
pretty
mood
of
mind
in
the
morning
and
expand
and
grow
interested
in
things
out
of
deerbrook
and
then
in
the
evening
the
greater
part
of
this
is
undone
and
they
go
to
bed
with
their
heads
full
of
small
vile
notions
about
their
neighbours
and
when
they
grow
too
wise
to
have
their
heads
so
filled
their
hearts
will
be
heavy
for
those
who
are
not
rising
like
themselves
that
is
unavoidable
and
they
must
bear
the
sorrow
we
must
hope
that
they
will
disperse
from
deerbrook
and
find
their
way
into
a
more
genial
society
than
they
can
ever
know
here
i
must
keep
the
confidence
of
my
children
sacred
even
from
you
margaret
but
you
may
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
you
knew
all
that
we
have
to
say
to
one
another
you
would
find
some
of
these
children
animated
with
really
noble
thoughts
and
capable
of
really
generous
acts
of
them
mary
in
particular
i
venture
to
conjecture
to
be
in
your
thoughts
yes
mary
in
particular
but
she
had
always
a
more
gentle
and
generous
temper
than
her
sisters
fanny
however
is
improving
remarkably
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
and
i
had
begun
to
suspect
it
fanny
i
observe
lays
fewer
informations
than
she
did
and
there
is
more
of
thought
and
less
of
a
prying
expression
in
her
face
she
is
really
growing
more
like
mary
in
countenance
the
little
rowlands
the
younger
ones
seem
simple
enough
but
matilda
what
a
disagreeable
child
she
is
the
most
that
can
be
done
with
her
is
to
leave
her
only
a
poor
creature
to
strip
her
of
the
conceit
and
malice
with
which
her
mother
would
overlay
her
feeble
intellect
this
sounds
deplorably
enough
but
as
parents
will
not
speak
the
plain
truth
to
themselves
about
their
charge
governesses
must
there
is
perhaps
little
better
material
in
fanny
but
i
trust
we
may
one
day
see
her
more
lowly
than
she
can
at
present
relish
the
idea
of
being
and
with
energy
enough
to
improve
under
the
discipline
of
life
when
she
can
no
longer
have
that
of
school
she
and
mary
have
been
acknowledging
a
fine
piece
of
experience
mr
grey
is
pleased
with
their
great
improvement
in
latin
he
finds
they
can
read
with
ease
and
pleasure
some
favourite
classical
scraps
which
he
used
to
talk
about
without
exciting
any
interest
in
them
they
honestly
denied
having
devoted
any
more
time
to
latin
than
before
or
having
taken
any
more
pains
and
no
new
methods
have
been
tried
here
was
a
mystery
they
have
solved
it
they
find
that
all
is
owing
to
their
getting
up
earlier
in
the
morning
to
teach
those
little
orphans
the
woods
to
read
and
sew
not
a
very
circuitous
process
said
margaret
love
and
kind
interest
energy
and
improvement
whether
in
latin
or
anything
else
but
what
did
you
mean
just
now
about
truth
what
should
make
the
greys
otherwise
than
truthful
oh
not
the
greys
i
was
thinking
of
the
other
family
when
i
said
that
but
that
is
a
large
subject
let
us
leave
it
till
after
tea
will
you
give
me
another
cup
now
shall
we
begin
upon
our
large
subject
said
she
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
and
kettle
and
margaret
handed
her
her
i
am
aware
that
i
asked
for
it
replied
margaret
but
it
is
a
disagreeable
topic
and
perhaps
we
had
better
avoid
it
you
will
take
me
for
a
deerbrook
person
if
i
say
we
will
go
into
it
will
not
you
oh
no
you
have
a
reason
i
see
so
why
should
not
the
little
rowlands
be
truthful
because
they
have
so
perpetual
an
example
of
falsehood
before
them
at
home
i
have
made
some
painful
discoveries
there
lately
is
it
possible
you
did
not
know
that
woman
long
ago
i
knew
her
obvious
qualities
which
there
is
no
need
to
specify
but
the
depth
of
her
untruth
is
a
new
fact
to
me
are
you
sure
of
it
now
quite
sure
of
it
in
some
particulars
and
strongly
suspecting
it
in
others
do
not
tell
your
sister
anything
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
unless
you
find
it
necessary
for
the
direction
of
her
conduct
let
your
disclosures
be
rather
to
mr
hope
that
is
settled
is
it
well
mrs
rowland
ruling
passion
just
now
is
hatred
to
your
household
i
suspected
as
much
but
the
untruth
wait
a
little
she
dislikes
you
all
and
severally
what
my
brother
oh
yes
for
marrying
into
the
grey
connection
so
decidedly
did
you
ever
hear
that
before
margaret
laughed
and
her
friend
went
on
this
capture
and
imprisonment
of
her
mother
for
the
poor
old
lady
is
not
allowed
to
see
whom
she
pleases
is
chiefly
to
get
her
from
under
mr
hope
care
i
fancy
from
her
air
and
from
some
things
she
has
dropped
that
she
has
some
grand
in
reserve
about
that
matter
but
this
is
merely
suspicion
i
will
now
speak
only
of
what
i
know
to
exist
she
is
injuring
your
brother
to
an
extent
that
he
is
not
but
ought
to
be
aware
of
what
does
she
say
she
shudders
at
his
politics
i
know
yes
that
might
be
ignorance
merely
and
even
conscientious
ignorance
so
we
will
let
that
pass
she
also
hints
very
plainly
and
extensively
that
your
brother
and
sister
are
not
happy
together
she
is
a
wicked
woman
said
margaret
with
a
deep
sigh
i
half
suspected
what
you
tell
me
from
poor
george
errand
that
unhappy
day
right
mr
rowland
irony
was
intended
to
stop
his
insinuations
before
the
children
she
says
the
most
unwarrantable
things
about
mrs
grey
having
made
the
match
and
she
intimates
that
hester
has
several
times
gone
to
bed
in
hysterics
from
mr
hope
having
upbraided
her
with
taking
him
in
what
to
be
done
cried
margaret
throwing
down
her
work
your
brother
will
decide
for
himself
whether
to
speak
to
mr
rowland
or
to
let
the
slander
pass
and
live
it
down
our
duty
is
to
give
him
information
and
i
feel
that
it
is
a
duty
and
now
have
you
been
told
anything
about
mr
hope
practice
of
dissection
margaret
related
what
she
had
heard
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
explanation
of
it
he
knows
more
than
he
told
you
i
have
no
doubt
replied
maria
the
beginning
of
it
was
your
brother
having
sent
a
great
toe
in
a
sealed
packet
to
some
lad
in
the
village
who
happened
to
open
it
at
table
you
may
imagine
the
conjectures
as
to
where
it
came
from
and
the
revival
of
stories
about
robbing
churchyards
and
of
prejudices
about
dissection
mrs
rowland
could
not
let
such
an
opportunity
as
this
pass
by
and
her
neighbours
have
been
favoured
with
dark
hints
as
to
what
has
been
heard
under
the
churchyard
wall
and
what
she
herself
has
seen
from
her
window
in
sleepless
nights
now
mr
hope
must
take
notice
of
this
it
is
too
dangerous
a
subject
to
be
left
quietly
to
the
ignorance
and
superstitions
of
such
a
set
of
people
as
those
among
whom
his
calling
lies
no
ignorance
on
earth
exceeds
that
of
the
country
folks
whom
he
attends
but
they
worship
him
cried
margaret
they
have
worshipped
him
but
you
know
worship
easily
gives
place
to
hatred
among
the
extremely
ignorant
and
nothing
is
so
likely
to
quicken
the
process
as
to
talk
about
violating
graves
do
not
be
frightened
i
tell
you
this
to
prevent
mischief
not
to
prophesy
it
mr
hope
will
take
what
measures
he
thinks
fit
and
i
shall
tell
mr
rowland
tomorrow
morning
that
i
am
the
source
of
your
information
i
was
just
going
to
warn
him
that
i
meant
to
speak
to
you
in
this
way
but
i
left
it
till
that
i
might
not
be
prevented
dear
maria
this
will
cost
you
your
bread
i
believe
not
but
this
consideration
belongs
to
that
future
of
time
on
which
as
i
was
saying
we
can
not
lay
our
little
fingers
the
present
is
clear
enough
that
mr
hope
ought
to
know
his
own
case
he
shall
know
it
but
maria
do
you
mean
that
mrs
rowland
talks
of
all
these
affairs
before
her
children
when
mr
rowland
is
not
present
to
check
it
and
this
brings
me
to
something
which
i
think
ought
to
be
said
though
i
have
no
proof
to
bring
having
found
of
late
what
things
mrs
rowland
can
say
for
a
purpose
how
variously
and
how
monstrously
untrue
and
seeing
that
all
her
enterprises
are
at
present
directed
against
the
people
who
live
in
a
pleasant
little
but
why
you
have
not
yet
fully
accounted
for
this
enmity
i
have
not
but
i
will
now
i
think
she
joins
your
name
with
her
brother
and
that
she
accordingly
hates
you
now
as
she
once
hated
hester
but
mind
i
am
not
sure
of
this
but
how
why
you
will
divine
that
i
have
changed
my
opinion
about
mr
being
engaged
to
miss
bruce
since
you
asked
me
for
my
judgment
upon
it
i
may
very
possibly
be
mistaken
but
as
mr
enderby
lies
under
censure
for
forming
and
carrying
on
such
an
arrangement
in
strange
concealment
from
his
most
intimate
friends
i
think
it
due
to
him
at
least
to
put
the
supposition
that
he
may
not
be
guilty
margaret
could
not
speak
though
a
thousand
questions
struggled
in
her
heart
i
am
aware
continued
maria
with
what
confidence
she
has
everywhere
stated
the
fact
of
this
engagement
and
that
mrs
enderby
fully
believes
it
but
i
have
been
struck
throughout
with
a
failure
of
particularity
in
mrs
rowland
knowledge
she
can
not
tell
when
her
brother
last
saw
miss
bruce
nor
whether
he
has
any
intention
of
going
to
rome
she
does
not
know
evidently
whether
he
was
engaged
when
he
was
last
here
and
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
that
his
being
engaged
now
is
a
matter
of
inference
from
a
small
set
of
facts
which
will
bear
more
than
one
interpretation
surely
she
would
not
dare
margaret
paused
it
is
a
bold
stroke
supposing
me
right
but
she
would
strike
boldly
to
make
a
quarrel
between
her
brother
and
his
friends
in
the
and
if
the
device
should
fail
at
last
she
has
the
intermediate
satisfaction
of
making
them
uncomfortable
horrid
creature
said
margaret
feeling
however
that
she
would
forgive
all
the
horridness
for
the
sake
of
finding
that
mrs
rowland
had
done
this
horrid
thing
we
must
not
forget
said
maria
that
there
is
another
side
to
the
question
young
men
have
been
known
to
engage
themselves
mysteriously
and
without
sufficient
respect
to
the
confidence
of
intimate
friends
this
must
be
ascertained
maria
and
again
margaret
stopped
short
with
a
blush
of
shame
by
time
margaret
in
no
other
way
i
can
not
of
course
speak
to
mr
rowland
or
any
one
on
so
private
an
affair
of
the
family
nor
under
the
circumstances
can
mr
hope
stir
in
it
we
must
wait
but
it
can
not
be
for
long
some
illumination
must
reach
deerbrook
soon
either
from
mr
enderby
going
to
rome
or
coming
here
to
see
his
mother
mrs
rowland
said
he
would
come
here
she
hoped
for
his
wedding
journey
she
did
say
so
i
know
and
she
has
told
plenty
of
people
that
her
brother
is
delighted
that
mrs
enderby
is
settled
with
her
whereas
some
beautiful
plants
arrived
this
morning
for
mrs
enderby
conservatory
by
his
orders
the
rowlands
have
no
conservatory
you
know
the
children
were
desired
not
to
mention
the
arrival
of
these
plants
to
grandmamma
and
mrs
rowland
wrote
by
return
of
post
i
imagine
to
inform
him
for
the
first
time
of
his
mother
removal
margaret
thought
these
things
were
too
bad
to
be
true
i
should
have
said
so
too
some
time
ago
and
as
i
can
not
too
earnestly
repeat
i
may
be
wrong
now
but
i
have
done
my
duty
in
giving
you
reason
for
suspending
your
judgment
of
mr
enderby
this
being
done
we
will
talk
of
something
now
do
not
you
think
there
may
be
some
difficulty
in
preserving
my
pupils
from
a
habit
of
untruth
yes
indeed
but
the
talking
of
something
else
did
not
operate
so
well
as
it
sounded
the
pauses
were
long
after
what
had
passed
at
length
when
margaret
detected
herself
in
the
midst
of
the
speculation
if
he
is
not
engaged
to
miss
bruce
it
does
not
follow
she
roused
herself
and
exclaimed
how
very
good
it
is
of
you
maria
to
have
laid
all
this
open
to
me
maria
hung
her
head
over
her
work
and
thought
within
herself
that
her
friend
could
not
judge
of
the
deed
she
replied
thank
you
i
thought
i
should
get
some
sympathy
from
you
in
the
end
to
repay
me
for
the
irksomeness
of
exposing
such
a
piece
of
social
vice
as
this
poor
lady
conduct
yes
indeed
i
ought
to
have
acknowledged
it
before
as
i
feel
it
but
you
know
there
is
so
much
to
think
over
it
is
so
wonderful
so
almost
inconceivable
it
is
so
is
it
quite
necessary
maria
yes
i
see
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
speak
to
mr
rowland
you
are
bound
in
honesty
to
do
so
but
it
will
be
very
painful
can
we
not
help
you
can
we
not
in
some
way
spare
you
no
you
can
not
thank
you
for
mr
rowland
sake
no
one
must
be
by
and
none
of
you
can
testify
to
the
facts
no
leave
me
alone
by
this
time
night
it
will
be
done
what
knock
is
that
no
one
ever
knocks
on
my
account
surely
it
can
not
be
your
servant
already
it
is
only
now
eight
i
promised
hester
i
would
go
home
early
she
can
not
want
you
half
so
much
as
i
do
stay
another
hour
margaret
could
not
hester
made
a
point
of
her
returning
at
this
time
when
the
cloaking
and
final
chat
were
done
and
margaret
was
at
the
door
maria
called
her
margaret
came
skipping
back
to
hear
her
friend
whisper
how
is
your
wretchedness
margaret
how
is
yours
was
margaret
reply
much
better
the
disburdening
of
it
is
a
great
comfort
and
the
pain
the
aching
oh
never
mind
that
margaret
shook
her
head
she
could
not
but
mind
it
but
wish
that
she
could
take
it
upon
herself
sometimes
she
had
often
thought
lately
that
she
should
rather
enjoy
a
few
weeks
of
maria
pain
as
an
alternative
to
the
woe
under
which
she
had
been
suffering
but
this
if
she
could
have
tried
the
experiment
she
would
probably
have
found
to
be
a
mistake
when
she
saw
her
friend
cover
her
eyes
with
her
hand
as
if
for
a
listless
hour
of
solitude
she
felt
that
she
had
been
wrong
in
yielding
to
her
sister
jealousy
of
her
being
so
much
with
maria
and
she
resolved
that
next
time
maria
should
appoint
the
hour
for
her
return
home
when
maria
was
thus
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
she
was
thinking
now
half
this
task
is
over
the
other
half
and
then
the
consequences
when
margaret
entered
the
at
home
where
her
brother
was
reading
aloud
to
hester
he
exclaimed
we
beat
all
deerbrook
for
early
visiting
i
think
here
are
you
home
and
i
dare
say
mr
tucker
has
still
another
pipe
to
smoke
and
the
wine
is
not
mulled
yet
at
the
jameses
it
is
quite
time
margaret
was
giving
us
a
little
of
her
company
i
am
sure
said
hester
you
forget
how
early
she
went
if
it
was
not
for
the
school
i
think
she
and
maria
would
spend
all
their
time
together
i
have
every
wish
not
to
interfere
but
i
can
not
think
that
this
friendship
has
made
maria
less
selfish
it
would
i
dare
say
my
dear
but
that
there
was
no
selfishness
to
begin
upon
i
am
afraid
she
is
very
unwell
margaret
in
much
pain
i
fear
i
will
go
and
see
if
i
can
do
her
any
good
you
can
glance
over
what
we
have
read
and
i
shall
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
go
on
with
it
i
wonder
you
left
maria
if
she
is
so
poorly
i
determined
that
i
would
not
another
time
but
this
time
i
had
promised
pray
do
not
make
out
that
i
am
any
restraint
upon
your
intercourse
with
maria
and
yet
it
is
not
quite
fair
to
say
that
either
i
do
not
think
it
is
quite
fair
but
you
should
warn
me
you
should
tell
me
if
i
ask
anything
unreasonable
when
are
you
going
again
an
old
patient
of
my
has
sent
us
a
quarter
of
a
chest
of
very
fine
oranges
we
will
carry
maria
a
basketful
of
oranges
chapter
twenty
five
long
walks
the
unhappy
are
indisposed
to
employment
all
active
occupations
are
wearisome
and
disgusting
in
prospect
at
a
time
when
everything
life
itself
is
full
of
weariness
and
disgust
yet
the
unhappy
must
be
employed
or
they
will
go
mad
comparatively
blessed
are
they
if
they
are
set
in
families
where
claims
and
duties
abound
and
can
not
be
escaped
in
the
pressure
of
business
there
is
present
safety
and
ultimate
relief
harder
is
the
lot
of
those
who
have
few
necessary
occupations
enforced
by
other
claims
than
their
own
harmlessness
and
profitableness
reading
often
fails
now
and
then
it
may
beguile
but
much
oftener
the
attention
is
languid
the
thoughts
wander
and
associations
with
the
subject
of
grief
are
awakened
women
who
find
that
reading
will
not
do
will
obtain
no
relief
from
sewing
sewing
is
pleasant
enough
in
moderation
to
those
whose
minds
are
at
ease
the
while
but
it
is
an
employment
which
is
trying
to
the
nerves
when
long
continued
at
the
best
and
nothing
can
be
worse
for
the
harassed
and
for
those
who
want
to
escape
from
themselves
writing
is
bad
the
pen
hangs
idly
suspended
over
the
paper
or
the
sad
thoughts
that
are
alive
within
write
themselves
down
the
safest
and
best
of
all
occupations
for
such
sufferers
as
are
fit
for
it
is
intercourse
with
young
children
an
infant
might
beguile
satan
and
his
peers
the
day
after
they
were
couched
on
the
lake
of
fire
if
the
love
of
children
chanced
to
linger
amidst
the
ruins
of
their
angelic
nature
next
to
this
comes
honest
genuine
acquaintanceship
among
the
poor
not
mere
grounded
on
and
blankets
but
intercourse
of
mind
with
real
mutual
interest
between
the
parties
gardening
is
excellent
because
it
unites
bodily
exertion
with
a
sufficient
engagement
of
the
faculties
while
sweet
compassionate
nature
is
ministering
cure
in
every
sprouting
leaf
and
scented
blossom
and
beckoning
sleep
to
draw
nigh
and
be
ready
to
follow
up
her
benignant
work
walking
is
good
not
stepping
from
shop
to
shop
or
from
neighbour
to
neighbour
but
stretching
out
far
into
the
country
to
the
freshest
fields
and
the
highest
ridges
and
the
quietest
lanes
however
sullen
the
imagination
may
have
been
among
its
griefs
at
home
here
it
cheers
up
and
smiles
however
listless
the
limbs
may
have
been
when
sustaining
a
too
heavy
heart
here
they
are
braced
and
the
lagging
gait
becomes
buoyant
again
however
perverse
the
memory
may
have
been
in
presenting
all
that
was
agonising
and
insisting
only
on
what
can
not
be
retrieved
here
it
is
first
disregarded
and
then
it
sleeps
and
the
sleep
of
the
memory
is
the
day
in
paradise
to
the
unhappy
the
mere
breathing
of
the
cool
wind
on
the
face
in
the
commonest
highway
is
rest
and
comfort
which
must
be
felt
at
such
times
to
be
believed
it
is
disbelieved
in
the
shortest
intervals
between
its
seasons
of
enjoyment
and
every
time
the
sufferer
has
resolution
to
go
forth
to
meet
it
it
penetrates
to
the
very
heart
in
glad
surprise
the
fields
are
better
still
for
there
is
the
lark
to
fill
up
the
hours
with
mirthful
music
or
at
worst
the
robin
and
flocks
of
fieldfares
to
show
that
the
hardest
day
has
its
life
and
hilarity
but
the
calmest
region
is
the
upland
where
human
life
is
spread
out
beneath
the
bodily
eye
where
the
mind
roves
from
the
peasant
nest
to
the
spiry
town
from
the
to
the
churchyard
from
the
diminished
team
in
the
patch
of
fallow
or
the
fisherman
boat
in
the
cove
to
the
viaduct
that
spans
the
valley
or
the
fleet
that
glides
on
the
horizon
this
is
the
perch
where
the
spirit
plumes
its
ruffled
and
drooping
wines
and
makes
ready
to
let
itself
down
any
wind
that
heaven
may
send
no
doubt
margaret
found
the
benefit
of
exercise
and
the
solitary
enjoyment
of
the
country
for
during
the
last
few
weeks
walking
seemed
to
have
become
a
passion
with
her
hester
was
almost
out
of
patience
about
it
when
for
a
moment
she
lost
sight
of
what
she
well
knew
must
be
the
cause
of
this
strong
new
interest
every
doubtful
morning
margaret
was
at
the
window
exploring
the
clouds
every
fine
day
she
laid
her
watch
on
the
table
before
her
impatiently
waiting
the
approach
of
the
hour
when
her
brother
was
to
come
in
for
hester
and
when
she
might
set
off
by
herself
not
to
return
till
she
became
renowned
in
deerbrook
for
the
length
of
her
excursions
the
grocer
had
met
her
far
out
in
one
direction
when
returning
from
making
his
purchases
at
the
market
town
the
butcher
had
seen
her
in
the
distant
fields
when
he
paid
a
visit
to
his
grazier
in
the
pastures
dr
levitt
had
walked
his
horse
beside
her
in
the
lane
which
formed
the
limit
of
the
longer
of
his
two
common
rides
and
many
a
neighbour
or
patient
of
mr
hope
had
been
surprised
at
her
declining
a
cast
in
a
or
gig
when
there
was
only
a
long
stretch
of
plain
road
before
her
and
the
lanes
and
fields
were
too
miry
to
enable
her
to
seek
any
variety
in
them
in
her
way
home
these
were
in
fact
margaret
times
of
refreshing
of
practical
worship
these
were
the
times
when
she
saw
what
at
other
moments
she
only
repeated
to
herself
that
all
things
are
right
and
that
our
personal
trials
derive
their
bitterness
from
our
ignorance
and
spiritual
inexperience
at
these
times
she
could
not
only
pity
all
who
suffered
but
congratulate
all
who
enjoyed
and
could
afford
feelings
of
disinterested
regard
to
philip
and
of
complacency
to
miss
bruce
she
remembered
that
miss
bruce
was
unconscious
of
having
injured
her
was
possibly
unaware
even
of
her
existence
and
then
she
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
blessing
her
rival
and
of
longing
for
an
opportunity
to
serve
her
secretly
and
silently
as
the
happy
girl
innocence
of
all
wrong
towards
her
deserved
margaret
desire
for
a
long
solitary
walk
was
as
strong
as
ever
the
day
after
she
had
visited
maria
no
opportunity
had
occurred
of
speaking
to
her
brother
without
alarming
hester
and
she
had
almost
determined
merely
to
refer
him
to
maria
instead
of
telling
the
story
herself
she
should
not
see
him
again
till
dinner
he
was
gone
into
the
country
the
day
was
gloomy
and
cold
and
hester
was
not
disposed
to
leave
the
fireside
so
margaret
issued
forth
with
thick
shoes
umbrella
and
muff
guarded
against
everything
that
might
occur
overhead
and
under
foot
she
had
generally
found
hope
or
at
least
comfort
abroad
when
she
ought
to
have
been
much
happier
she
found
anxiety
and
fear
the
thought
the
very
words
would
incessantly
recur
he
is
not
engaged
to
miss
bruce
it
does
not
follow
then
she
seriously
grieved
for
her
brother
and
the
troubles
which
she
feared
awaited
him
and
then
she
reproached
herself
with
not
grieving
enough
not
having
attention
enough
to
spare
from
her
own
concerns
while
she
was
walking
along
on
the
dry
causeway
looking
straight
before
her
but
thinking
of
far
other
things
than
the
she
was
startled
by
the
stroke
of
a
horse
foot
against
a
stone
close
by
her
side
and
a
voice
speaking
almost
in
her
ear
it
was
only
edward
he
was
going
a
couple
of
miles
forward
and
he
brought
his
horse
beside
the
raised
causeway
so
that
they
could
converse
as
if
walking
together
there
is
nobody
to
overhear
us
i
think
said
margaret
looking
round
i
have
been
wanting
since
yesterday
evening
to
speak
to
you
alone
about
something
very
disagreeable
which
i
would
not
disturb
hester
with
you
of
course
can
do
as
you
please
about
telling
her
she
related
to
him
the
whole
story
of
mrs
rowland
imputations
and
proceedings
her
reports
of
the
hysterics
and
their
origin
the
and
the
cause
and
mode
of
mrs
enderby
removal
margaret
had
always
considered
her
brother
as
a
man
of
uncommon
nerve
and
her
surprise
was
therefore
great
at
seeing
him
change
colour
as
he
did
we
shall
agree
said
she
that
the
worst
of
all
this
is
that
there
is
some
truth
at
the
bottom
part
of
it
oh
heavens
thought
hope
is
it
possible
that
mrs
grey
can
have
told
the
share
she
had
in
my
marriage
it
was
but
a
momentary
fear
margaret
went
on
i
have
never
hoped
i
never
hoped
at
birmingham
and
much
less
here
that
hester
could
escape
the
observation
of
her
neighbours
that
her
occasional
agitation
of
spirits
should
not
excite
remark
and
speculation
as
we
are
not
quite
whole
and
sound
in
our
domestic
peace
i
must
speak
plainly
brother
at
such
a
time
as
this
i
should
think
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice
of
that
set
of
imputations
i
trust
we
shall
live
them
down
you
gave
me
great
comfort
in
a
few
words
once
said
hope
do
you
remember
saying
the
time
for
acting
comes
see
how
she
will
act
you
know
her
well
and
you
judge
her
rightly
and
you
will
perhaps
be
the
less
sorry
to
hear
that
the
time
seems
coming
when
we
may
all
have
to
act
i
scarcely
see
how
but
against
adversity
she
will
come
out
nobly
then
i
fear
nothing
for
her
but
too
much
prosperity
there
is
no
fear
of
that
i
assure
you
said
hope
smiling
somewhat
sadly
you
find
the
effect
of
this
woman
slanders
my
situation
has
from
one
cause
or
more
totally
changed
since
you
first
knew
me
it
would
break
hester
heart
to
hear
what
i
am
subjected
to
in
the
discharge
of
my
daily
business
i
tell
her
a
trifle
now
and
then
to
prepare
her
for
what
may
happen
but
she
and
you
do
not
know
a
tenth
part
of
what
is
inflicted
upon
me
and
what
may
happen
i
can
not
see
the
extent
of
it
myself
but
i
am
losing
my
practice
every
day
no
not
through
any
failure
not
through
any
of
the
accidents
which
will
happen
in
all
medical
practice
there
are
reports
of
such
abroad
i
believe
but
nothing
is
commoner
than
those
reports
the
truth
is
no
patient
of
mine
has
died
or
failed
to
do
well
for
an
unusually
long
space
of
time
the
discontent
with
me
is
from
other
causes
from
mrs
rowland
tongue
i
doubt
not
more
than
from
your
politics
the
ignorance
of
the
people
about
us
is
the
great
evil
without
this
neither
mrs
rowland
nor
any
one
else
could
persuade
them
that
i
rob
the
churchyard
and
vaccinate
children
to
get
patients
and
draw
good
teeth
to
sell
again
oh
monstrous
said
margaret
who
yet
could
not
help
laughing
you
never
draw
teeth
do
you
sometimes
but
not
when
i
can
get
people
to
go
to
the
dentist
at
blickley
mrs
grey
used
to
boast
to
you
of
my
popularity
but
i
never
liked
it
much
i
had
to
be
perpetually
on
the
watch
to
avoid
confidences
and
you
see
how
fast
the
stream
is
at
present
running
the
contrary
way
i
can
hardly
get
on
my
horse
now
without
being
insulted
at
my
own
door
must
you
submit
to
all
this
by
no
means
i
have
called
two
or
three
men
to
account
and
shaken
my
whip
over
one
or
two
more
with
excellent
effect
if
there
were
none
but
bullies
among
my
enemies
i
could
easily
deal
with
them
but
can
not
we
go
away
and
settle
somewhere
else
oh
no
wherever
i
might
go
it
would
soon
be
understood
that
i
had
been
obliged
to
leave
deerbrook
from
being
detected
in
and
the
like
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
stay
we
must
remain
and
live
down
all
imputations
whatever
if
we
can
and
if
we
can
not
then
we
shall
see
what
to
do
when
the
time
comes
and
having
managed
the
bullies
how
do
you
propose
to
manage
mrs
rowland
what
do
you
think
of
speaking
to
mr
grey
i
shall
not
do
that
the
greys
have
no
concern
with
it
but
they
will
think
they
have
then
there
will
be
a
partisan
warfare
with
me
for
the
pretext
and
the
two
families
have
had
quite
warfare
enough
for
a
lifetime
already
no
i
shall
not
bring
the
greys
into
it
i
am
sorry
enough
for
mr
rowland
for
i
am
sure
he
has
no
part
in
all
this
i
shall
go
to
him
i
should
confront
the
lady
at
once
and
call
her
to
account
but
that
miss
young
must
be
considered
the
more
courageous
and
disinterested
she
is
the
more
care
we
must
take
of
her
perhaps
she
is
at
this
moment
telling
mr
rowland
what
we
talked
about
last
night
how
very
painful
do
you
know
she
thinks
it
is
right
to
tell
the
whole
for
other
people
sake
she
thinks
that
what
mrs
rowland
says
is
not
to
be
trusted
in
any
case
where
she
feels
enmity
maria
even
doubts
whether
mr
enderby
has
treated
you
and
his
other
friends
so
very
negligently
whether
he
is
engaged
to
miss
bruce
after
all
mr
hope
was
so
much
engaged
about
one
of
his
stirrups
while
margaret
said
this
that
he
could
not
observe
where
and
how
she
was
looking
very
likely
replied
hope
at
length
hester
has
thought
all
along
that
this
was
possible
we
shall
know
the
truth
from
enderby
himself
one
of
these
days
by
act
or
word
meantime
i
for
one
shall
wait
to
hear
his
own
story
there
was
another
pause
at
the
end
of
which
mr
hope
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
said
he
must
be
riding
on
margaret
called
him
back
for
a
moment
to
ask
what
he
wished
her
to
do
about
informing
hester
of
the
state
of
affairs
mr
hope
was
disposed
to
tell
her
the
whole
if
possible
but
not
till
he
should
have
come
to
some
issue
with
mr
rowland
he
hated
mysteries
any
concealments
in
families
and
it
was
due
both
to
hester
and
to
himself
that
there
should
be
no
concealment
of
important
affairs
from
her
the
only
cautions
to
be
observed
were
to
save
her
from
suspense
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
a
formal
telling
of
bad
news
and
to
choose
an
opportunity
when
she
might
have
time
before
seeing
any
of
the
rowlands
to
consider
the
principles
which
should
regulate
her
conduct
to
them
that
she
might
do
herself
honour
by
the
consistency
and
temper
of
which
she
was
capable
under
any
circumstances
when
she
was
only
allowed
time
this
was
settled
and
he
rode
off
with
almost
his
usual
gaiety
of
air
he
saw
mr
rowland
before
night
the
next
day
but
one
a
from
blickley
was
seen
standing
at
mr
door
and
before
the
clock
struck
nine
it
was
loaded
with
trunks
and
and
crowded
with
people
as
it
drove
down
the
village
street
merry
little
faces
appeared
at
each
carriage
window
mr
rowland
was
on
the
box
he
was
going
to
take
his
family
to
cheltenham
for
the
spring
months
miss
rowland
was
rather
delicate
and
deerbrook
was
cold
in
march
mrs
enderby
was
left
behind
but
there
was
phoebe
to
take
care
of
her
and
mr
rowland
was
to
return
as
soon
as
he
had
settled
his
family
it
seemed
rather
a
pity
to
be
sure
that
the
old
lady
had
been
moved
out
of
her
own
house
just
before
she
was
to
be
left
alone
in
her
new
residence
but
between
mr
rowland
and
her
maid
she
would
be
taken
good
care
of
and
the
family
would
return
when
the
warm
weather
set
in
chapter
twenty
six
disclosures
the
whole
village
seemed
relieved
by
the
departure
of
the
rowlands
mrs
grey
who
had
always
been
refused
admission
to
her
old
friend
on
one
pretence
or
another
was
joyfully
welcomed
by
phoebe
and
was
plunged
into
all
the
delights
of
neighbourly
chat
before
the
clock
struck
twelve
on
the
very
first
morning
fanny
and
mary
grey
voluntarily
offered
to
go
to
miss
young
now
that
they
were
her
only
pupils
to
save
her
the
trouble
of
the
walk
to
the
schoolroom
this
was
a
great
relief
to
maria
and
her
little
parlour
held
the
three
very
nicely
and
when
the
girls
had
sufficiently
admired
the
screen
over
again
their
father
profile
the
planets
and
the
dargle
they
settled
quite
as
well
as
at
home
there
was
still
a
corner
left
for
cousin
margaret
when
she
chose
to
come
with
her
german
books
or
her
work
and
her
useful
remarks
on
what
they
were
doing
no
immediate
consequences
had
happened
to
maria
from
her
with
mr
rowland
and
she
was
quite
ready
to
enjoy
the
three
months
of
freedom
without
looking
too
anxiously
towards
the
end
of
them
the
very
gardener
at
the
rowlands
seemed
to
bestir
himself
with
unusual
alacrity
to
put
the
garden
into
spring
trim
and
the
cook
and
housemaid
might
be
seen
over
the
hedge
walking
on
the
smelling
at
the
mezereon
and
admiring
miss
anna
border
of
yellow
crocuses
as
the
gardener
said
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
fine
plants
out
of
a
conservatory
the
birds
themselves
seemed
to
begin
their
twittering
in
the
trees
and
the
cows
their
lowing
in
the
meadow
from
the
hour
that
mrs
rowland
went
away
in
other
words
there
were
many
whom
that
event
left
free
and
at
ease
to
observe
the
harmonies
of
nature
who
were
usually
compelled
to
observe
only
the
lady
and
the
discords
of
her
household
it
was
only
the
second
day
after
the
departure
of
the
family
that
margaret
took
her
seat
in
the
offered
corner
of
maria
parlour
she
laid
down
her
book
and
took
up
her
work
when
the
question
arose
which
has
probably
interested
all
intelligent
for
many
a
year
what
made
so
many
athenians
so
many
that
there
must
have
been
some
wise
and
good
men
among
them
treat
such
a
person
as
socrates
in
the
way
they
did
margaret
was
quite
occupied
in
admiring
the
sort
of
socratic
method
with
which
maria
drew
out
from
the
minds
of
her
pupils
some
of
the
difficult
philosophy
of
opinion
and
the
liberality
with
which
she
allowed
for
the
distress
of
heathen
moralists
at
having
the
sanction
of
custom
broken
up
margaret
was
thus
quite
occupied
with
the
delight
of
seeing
a
great
subject
skilfully
let
down
into
young
minds
and
the
others
were
no
less
busy
with
the
subject
itself
when
mary
started
and
said
it
made
her
jump
to
see
sydney
bring
fairy
close
up
to
the
window
fanny
imperiously
bade
her
mind
what
she
was
about
and
let
sydney
alone
but
yet
in
a
minute
or
two
fanny
own
eyes
were
detected
wandering
into
the
yard
where
sydney
still
remained
he
is
getting
fairy
shod
she
said
in
a
soliloquising
tone
every
one
laughed
the
idea
of
shoeing
a
fairy
was
so
ridiculous
and
some
witticisms
about
bottom
the
weaver
and
his
ass
head
were
sported
it
was
evident
that
socrates
had
no
more
chance
this
day
and
maria
changed
the
subject
sydney
looks
very
much
as
if
he
wanted
to
come
in
observed
mary
sydney
did
particularly
wish
to
come
in
but
he
saw
that
cousin
margaret
was
there
and
he
had
felt
an
unconquerable
awe
of
cousin
margaret
ever
since
the
day
of
his
conveying
her
over
the
ice
so
he
stood
irresolutely
watching
as
nail
after
nail
was
driven
into
fairy
hoof
casting
glances
every
minute
at
the
window
shall
i
see
what
he
wants
asked
margaret
perceiving
that
lessons
would
not
go
on
till
sydney
had
got
out
what
he
wished
to
say
may
i
open
the
window
for
a
moment
maria
to
speak
to
him
what
do
you
think
cried
sydney
taking
instant
advantage
of
the
movement
and
carrying
off
his
awkwardness
by
whipping
the
while
he
spoke
what
you
think
mr
enderby
is
come
by
the
coach
this
morning
i
saw
him
myself
and
you
might
have
met
our
ben
carrying
his
portmanteau
home
from
where
he
was
put
down
half
an
hour
ago
we
have
rare
sport
if
he
stays
as
long
as
he
did
last
summer
i
do
believe
he
continued
leaning
into
the
room
and
speaking
with
a
touch
of
his
mother
mystery
he
would
have
come
long
since
if
mrs
rowland
had
not
been
here
i
wish
she
had
taken
herself
off
two
months
ago
and
then
i
might
have
had
a
run
with
the
harriers
with
him
as
he
promised
i
should
now
you
have
said
just
a
little
too
much
sydney
so
you
may
go
said
maria
shut
down
the
window
will
you
it
was
well
for
margaret
that
there
was
the
recess
of
the
window
to
lean
in
there
she
stood
not
speaking
a
word
it
was
not
in
nature
for
maria
to
refrain
from
casting
a
glance
at
her
which
glance
grew
into
a
look
of
intelligence
you
do
not
quite
wink
as
mamma
does
observed
fanny
but
i
know
very
well
what
you
mean
miss
young
so
people
always
fancy
when
they
observe
upon
nothing
or
upon
what
they
know
nothing
about
fanny
but
i
thought
you
were
convinced
some
time
ago
that
you
should
not
watch
people
countenances
to
find
out
what
they
are
thinking
any
more
than
i
should
read
a
letter
they
are
writing
interrupted
fanny
well
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
young
but
i
really
thought
i
saw
you
looking
at
cousin
margaret
face
however
i
dare
say
everybody
supposes
the
same
that
mr
enderby
would
not
have
been
here
now
if
mrs
rowland
had
not
gone
away
you
need
not
mind
mary
and
me
miss
young
you
know
we
hear
all
about
mrs
rowland
at
home
i
know
you
are
apt
to
fancy
that
you
understand
all
about
mrs
rowland
my
dear
but
perhaps
mrs
rowland
herself
might
happen
to
differ
from
you
if
she
could
look
into
your
mind
it
is
for
you
to
settle
with
yourself
whether
you
think
she
would
be
satisfied
that
you
have
done
by
her
as
you
would
have
her
do
by
you
this
is
your
own
affair
fanny
so
now
without
any
one
trying
to
see
in
your
face
what
you
think
of
yourself
we
will
go
to
our
business
the
scratching
of
pens
in
the
and
the
turning
over
of
the
dictionary
now
proceeded
for
some
time
in
profound
silence
in
the
midst
of
which
margaret
stole
back
to
her
corner
there
goes
twelve
softly
exclaimed
mary
mamma
said
we
might
go
with
her
to
call
at
cousin
hester
if
we
were
home
and
ready
by
twelve
we
shall
not
have
nearly
done
miss
young
miss
young
did
not
take
the
hint
she
only
said
is
your
mamma
going
to
call
on
mrs
hope
then
margaret
do
not
let
us
detain
you
here
you
will
wish
to
be
at
home
i
am
sure
never
as
maria
supposed
had
margaret
more
impatiently
desired
to
be
at
home
though
accustomed
to
go
in
and
out
of
maria
abode
with
or
without
reason
assigned
she
had
not
now
ventured
to
move
though
the
little
room
felt
like
a
prison
an
awkward
consciousness
had
fixed
her
to
her
seat
now
however
she
made
haste
to
depart
promising
to
visit
her
friend
again
very
soon
the
little
girls
wanted
her
to
arrange
to
come
every
morning
and
stay
all
the
time
of
lessons
but
margaret
declined
making
any
such
engagement
as
she
went
home
she
scarcely
raised
her
eyes
for
fear
of
seeing
and
yet
she
lingered
for
an
instant
at
her
brother
door
from
a
feeling
of
disappointment
at
having
met
no
one
she
knew
she
had
fully
and
undoubtingly
intended
to
tell
hester
of
arrival
but
when
she
had
taken
off
her
bonnet
and
settled
herself
beside
her
sister
in
the
she
found
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
open
the
subject
while
she
was
meditating
upon
this
the
entrance
of
the
greys
seemed
to
settle
the
matter
she
supposed
they
would
make
the
disclosure
for
her
but
she
soon
perceived
that
they
had
not
heard
the
news
mrs
grey
went
on
quoting
mrs
enderby
and
phoebe
and
sophia
remarked
on
the
forsaken
condition
of
the
old
lady
in
a
way
which
was
quite
incompatible
with
any
knowledge
of
the
new
aspect
which
affairs
had
assumed
this
morning
it
was
a
great
relief
to
margaret
to
be
spared
the
discussion
of
a
fact
on
which
so
much
was
to
be
said
but
lo
in
the
midst
of
a
flow
of
talk
about
fomentations
and
the
best
kind
of
for
a
sick
room
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
every
stroke
of
which
was
recognised
to
a
certainty
by
margaret
while
the
other
ladies
were
pushing
back
their
chairs
to
break
up
the
appearance
of
a
gossip
and
make
room
for
another
party
of
visitors
margaret
was
wholly
occupied
with
contriving
to
sit
upright
notwithstanding
the
dimness
that
came
over
her
sight
it
was
he
he
entered
the
room
quickly
looked
taller
than
ever
as
sophia
thought
to
herself
and
more
than
ever
like
a
polish
count
now
that
his
blue
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
he
stopped
for
half
a
moment
on
seeing
ladies
in
cloaks
and
bonnets
and
then
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
everybody
hester
observed
that
he
looked
full
at
margaret
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
but
margaret
did
not
see
this
for
though
she
commanded
herself
wonderfully
she
could
not
meet
his
eye
of
course
he
was
asked
when
he
arrived
and
had
to
answer
the
question
and
also
the
remarks
which
were
made
on
the
length
of
his
absence
and
on
the
expectations
of
everybody
in
deerbrook
that
he
would
have
visited
the
old
place
at
christmas
or
new
year
he
was
then
pitied
on
account
of
the
state
of
his
mother
health
to
this
he
made
no
reply
whatever
but
when
mrs
grey
inquired
how
he
found
mrs
enderby
he
briefly
somewhat
abruptly
answered
that
he
thought
her
very
ill
it
was
equally
impossible
for
margaret
to
sit
totally
silent
while
all
this
was
going
on
and
to
address
herself
to
him
she
therefore
kept
some
conversation
with
sophia
on
the
greenhouse
and
the
fate
of
the
evergreens
in
the
shrubbery
in
consequence
of
the
severity
of
the
frost
in
january
which
laurestinus
had
been
lost
and
how
the
arbutus
had
suffered
and
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
laurels
on
the
grass
could
grow
up
to
their
former
size
and
beauty
while
sophia
was
telling
that
the
greenhouse
occupied
a
great
deal
of
time
and
that
she
had
therefore
turned
over
her
interest
in
it
to
sydney
and
begged
the
little
girls
to
divide
her
garden
between
them
mr
enderby
was
seen
to
take
hester
into
the
window
and
after
remarking
upon
the
snowdrops
beneath
to
speak
privately
to
her
margaret
was
afraid
mrs
grey
would
take
the
hint
and
go
away
her
presence
now
appeared
a
sort
of
protection
which
margaret
exerted
herself
to
retain
by
not
allowing
the
conversation
to
flag
she
need
not
have
feared
mrs
grey
was
turning
over
in
her
mind
how
she
might
best
introduce
her
congratulations
on
mr
enderby
engagement
and
her
inquiries
after
miss
bruce
welfare
topics
on
which
she
conceived
that
good
manners
required
her
to
enter
meantime
mr
enderby
had
been
saying
to
hester
you
will
excuse
the
offer
of
my
good
wishes
on
your
settlement
here
being
briefly
and
hastily
made
but
i
am
at
this
moment
in
great
anxiety
is
hope
at
home
no
he
is
some
miles
off
in
the
country
then
i
must
charge
you
with
a
message
to
him
i
think
my
mother
very
ill
and
i
find
it
is
some
time
since
hope
has
seen
her
will
you
beg
him
to
come
to
her
without
loss
of
time
when
he
returns
certainly
he
will
be
home
within
two
or
three
hours
i
have
no
doubt
and
then
ask
him
whether
he
will
not
prescribe
a
visit
from
you
to
my
mother
it
will
do
her
good
i
am
confident
you
know
she
is
all
alone
now
with
her
maid
i
am
aware
of
that
it
is
not
from
negligence
or
disinclination
i
assure
you
that
we
have
seen
so
little
of
mrs
enderby
for
some
time
past
i
know
it
i
know
it
said
he
shaking
his
head
then
after
a
pause
shall
you
be
at
home
this
evening
yes
and
alone
yes
will
you
come
thank
you
i
will
come
in
for
an
hour
i
shall
then
hear
hope
report
of
my
mother
and
between
ourselves
i
want
a
few
words
with
your
sister
can
you
manage
this
for
me
no
doubt
he
was
gone
in
another
moment
with
a
bow
to
the
whole
party
gone
cried
mrs
grey
and
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
him
about
his
engagement
and
miss
bruce
how
very
odd
he
must
think
us
sophia
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
all
we
have
to
say
observed
hester
he
is
so
uneasy
about
his
mother
i
see
that
he
will
not
leave
her
yet
awhile
margaret
was
sure
she
perceived
in
her
sister
beautiful
eye
and
lip
the
subtle
expression
of
amusement
that
they
bore
when
a
gay
thought
was
in
her
mind
or
when
her
neighbours
were
setting
off
in
speculation
on
a
wrong
scent
but
half
the
grace
of
one
good
wishes
is
in
their
being
offered
readily
said
mrs
grey
as
i
was
saying
to
sophia
the
other
day
when
we
were
considering
whether
mr
grey
should
not
write
to
mr
enderby
with
our
congratulations
should
not
like
to
appear
backward
on
such
an
occasion
for
many
reasons
well
now
my
dears
one
thing
more
you
must
come
to
tea
with
us
this
evening
it
will
be
a
mild
evening
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
have
sent
to
miss
young
to
say
that
my
sedan
will
bring
her
at
six
we
have
quite
set
our
hearts
upon
having
you
for
a
sociable
evening
thank
you
said
hester
we
would
come
with
great
pleasure
but
that
we
are
engaged
engaged
my
dear
margaret
has
just
told
us
that
you
have
no
engagement
so
margaret
thought
but
we
are
engaged
a
friend
of
mr
hope
is
coming
to
spend
the
evening
and
i
promised
that
we
would
be
at
home
dear
said
sophia
and
we
had
quite
set
our
hearts
upon
your
coming
can
not
you
bring
the
gentleman
with
you
my
dear
i
am
sure
mr
grey
will
be
happy
to
see
any
friend
of
mr
hope
thank
you
but
he
is
coming
on
business
oh
well
but
margaret
can
be
spared
surely
i
suppose
you
must
stay
and
make
tea
my
dear
it
would
not
do
i
know
for
you
to
appear
to
neglect
your
husband
country
patients
particularly
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
but
margaret
can
come
surely
sydney
shall
step
for
her
a
little
before
six
oh
yes
said
sophia
margaret
can
come
the
gentleman
can
have
no
business
with
her
i
suppose
margaret
was
again
puzzled
with
the
fun
that
lurked
in
the
eye
and
lip
she
had
been
passive
till
now
but
seeing
hester
determination
that
she
should
not
go
she
said
very
decidedly
that
she
should
much
prefer
coming
some
evening
when
her
brother
and
sister
need
not
be
left
behind
mrs
grey
is
not
very
well
pleased
observed
margaret
when
their
visitors
were
gone
could
not
you
have
been
a
little
more
explicit
as
to
this
gentleman
whoever
he
may
be
i
thought
it
better
not
to
say
more
said
hester
now
unable
to
help
stealing
a
glance
at
her
sister
our
visitor
is
to
be
mr
enderby
he
is
so
uneasy
about
his
mother
that
my
husband
is
to
see
her
this
afternoon
and
mr
enderby
offers
to
come
in
the
evening
to
discuss
her
case
after
a
slight
pause
hester
continued
sophia
was
very
positive
about
its
being
impossible
that
our
visitor
could
have
any
business
with
you
was
not
she
oh
hester
said
margaret
imploringly
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
well
well
said
hester
remembering
how
cruel
this
speech
might
appear
to
her
sister
i
ought
not
to
speak
to
you
from
my
own
habitual
disbelief
of
mrs
rowland
news
i
will
go
away
dear
only
just
saying
first
that
i
like
philip
looks
very
well
he
does
not
seem
happier
than
he
ought
to
be
while
his
mother
is
so
ill
nor
does
he
act
as
if
he
felt
he
had
neglected
us
his
old
friends
as
my
husband
says
we
must
hear
his
own
story
before
we
judge
him
when
she
left
the
room
margaret
could
not
have
settled
with
herself
whether
there
was
most
pain
or
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
this
evening
five
minutes
before
she
had
believed
that
she
should
spend
it
at
the
greys
should
hear
the
monotonous
hiss
of
the
urn
which
seemed
to
take
up
its
song
every
time
she
went
where
it
had
left
off
last
should
see
mrs
grey
winks
from
behind
it
should
have
the
same
sort
of
cake
cut
by
sophia
into
pieces
of
exactly
the
same
size
should
hear
sydney
told
to
be
quiet
and
the
little
girls
to
go
to
bed
should
have
to
play
mrs
grey
favourite
waltz
and
sing
mr
grey
favourite
song
and
at
last
to
refuse
a
glass
of
sherry
three
times
over
and
come
away
after
hearing
much
wonder
expressed
that
the
evening
was
gone
already
now
instead
of
this
there
was
to
be
the
fear
and
constraint
of
presence
so
unlike
what
that
had
ever
been
before
no
longer
gay
easy
and
delightful
but
all
that
was
awkward
no
one
would
be
sure
of
what
the
others
were
feeling
or
whether
there
was
any
sufficient
reason
for
their
mutual
feelings
being
so
changed
who
would
find
the
conversation
what
could
be
talked
about
which
would
not
bring
one
or
another
into
collision
with
mrs
rowland
or
miss
bruce
but
yet
there
would
be
his
presence
and
with
it
bliss
there
would
be
his
very
voice
and
something
of
his
thoughts
could
not
but
come
out
she
was
better
pleased
than
if
his
evening
was
to
be
spent
anywhere
else
dinner
passed
she
did
not
know
how
except
that
her
brother
thought
mrs
enderby
not
materially
worse
than
when
he
saw
her
last
the
came
and
stood
an
hour
mr
hope
being
evidently
restless
and
on
the
watch
he
said
at
last
that
it
would
be
better
to
get
tea
over
before
enderby
came
and
margaret
repeated
in
her
own
mind
that
it
less
awkward
and
yet
she
was
disappointed
the
moment
the
table
was
cleared
knock
was
heard
he
would
not
have
tea
he
had
been
making
his
mother
tea
and
had
had
a
cup
with
her
and
now
what
was
hope
judgment
on
her
state
of
health
the
gentlemen
had
scarcely
entered
upon
the
subject
when
a
note
was
brought
in
for
margaret
everything
made
her
nervous
but
the
purport
of
this
note
was
merely
to
ask
for
a
book
which
she
had
promised
to
lend
mrs
levitt
as
she
went
up
to
her
room
for
it
she
was
vexed
that
the
interruption
had
occurred
now
and
was
heartily
angry
with
herself
that
she
could
command
herself
no
better
and
be
no
more
like
other
people
than
she
fancied
she
had
been
this
day
there
is
hester
thought
she
looking
nothing
less
than
merry
and
talking
about
whatever
occurs
as
if
nothing
had
happened
since
we
met
him
last
while
i
sit
feeling
like
a
fool
with
not
a
word
to
say
and
no
courage
to
say
it
if
i
had
i
wonder
whether
i
have
always
been
as
insignificant
and
dull
as
i
have
seen
myself
to
be
i
do
not
believe
i
ever
thought
about
the
matter
before
i
wish
i
could
forget
it
now
notwithstanding
her
feeling
of
insignificance
in
the
however
she
was
so
impatient
to
be
there
again
that
her
hands
trembled
with
eagerness
in
doing
up
the
parcel
for
mrs
levitt
when
she
the
philip
was
there
alone
standing
by
the
fire
margaret
first
impulse
was
to
retreat
but
her
better
judgment
prevailed
in
time
to
intercept
the
act
philip
said
mr
and
mrs
hope
have
at
my
desire
given
me
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
alone
you
must
not
refuse
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
because
it
is
necessary
to
the
vindication
of
my
honour
and
it
is
also
due
to
another
person
of
course
margaret
sat
down
she
seemed
to
intend
to
speak
and
philip
waited
to
hear
her
but
no
words
came
so
he
went
on
you
have
been
told
i
find
that
i
have
been
for
some
time
engaged
to
a
lady
who
is
now
at
rome
miss
bruce
how
such
a
notion
originated
we
need
not
inquire
the
truth
is
that
i
am
but
slightly
acquainted
with
miss
bruce
and
that
nothing
has
ever
occurred
which
could
warrant
such
a
use
of
that
lady
name
i
heard
nothing
of
this
till
and
is
it
possible
breathed
margaret
i
was
shocked
to
hear
of
it
from
my
poor
mother
but
infinitely
more
shocked
grieved
to
the
very
soul
to
find
that
you
margaret
believed
it
how
could
we
help
it
it
was
your
sister
who
told
us
what
does
my
sister
know
of
me
compared
with
you
i
thought
i
hoped
but
i
see
now
that
i
was
presumptuous
i
thought
that
you
knew
me
enough
and
cared
for
me
enough
to
understand
my
mind
and
trust
my
conduct
through
whatever
you
might
hear
of
me
from
others
i
have
been
deceived
i
mean
i
have
deceived
myself
as
to
the
relation
in
which
we
stand
i
do
not
blame
you
margaret
that
is
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
for
what
you
have
given
credit
to
about
me
but
i
did
not
think
you
would
have
mortified
me
so
deeply
you
are
partly
wrong
now
you
are
unjust
at
this
moment
replied
margaret
looking
up
with
some
spirit
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
of
mrs
rowland
but
remember
your
mother
never
doubted
what
your
sister
said
the
information
was
given
in
such
a
way
as
left
almost
an
impossibility
of
disbelief
there
was
nothing
to
set
against
the
most
positive
assurances
nothing
from
you
not
a
word
to
any
of
your
old
friends
and
there
was
i
working
away
on
a
new
and
good
plan
of
life
living
for
you
and
counting
the
weeks
and
days
between
me
and
the
time
when
i
might
come
and
show
you
what
your
power
over
me
had
enabled
me
to
do
and
you
were
all
the
while
despising
or
forgetting
me
allowing
me
no
means
of
defending
myself
yielding
me
up
to
dishonour
with
a
mere
shake
of
the
head
as
if
i
had
been
an
acquaintance
of
two
or
three
it
is
clear
that
you
knew
my
mind
no
better
than
i
now
find
i
knew
yours
what
would
you
have
had
me
do
asked
margaret
with
such
voice
as
she
had
i
believe
i
had
not
thought
of
that
said
philip
half
laughing
i
only
felt
that
you
ought
to
have
trusted
me
that
you
must
have
known
that
i
loved
neither
miss
bruce
nor
any
one
but
you
and
that
i
could
not
be
engaged
to
any
one
while
i
loved
tell
me
at
once
margaret
did
i
not
deserve
this
much
from
you
you
did
said
margaret
distinctly
but
there
is
another
way
of
viewing
the
whole
which
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
you
i
have
been
to
blame
perhaps
but
if
you
had
thought
of
the
other
possibility
what
other
oh
do
speak
plainly
i
must
at
such
a
time
as
this
if
i
could
not
think
you
guilty
i
might
fancy
myself
to
have
been
mistaken
and
did
you
fancy
so
did
you
suppose
i
neither
loved
you
nor
meant
you
to
think
that
i
did
i
did
conclude
myself
mistaken
oh
margaret
i
should
say
if
i
dared
that
such
a
thought
such
humility
such
generosity
could
come
of
nothing
but
love
margaret
made
no
reply
they
understood
one
another
too
completely
for
words
even
in
the
first
gush
of
joy
there
was
intense
bitterness
in
the
thought
of
what
margaret
must
have
suffered
and
philip
vowed
in
the
bottom
of
his
soul
that
his
whole
life
should
be
devoted
to
make
her
forget
it
he
could
have
cursed
his
sister
with
equal
energy
there
was
no
end
to
what
had
to
be
said
philip
was
impatient
to
tell
what
he
had
been
doing
and
the
reasons
of
the
whole
of
his
conduct
margaret
views
had
become
his
own
as
to
the
desultoriness
of
the
life
he
had
hitherto
led
he
had
applied
himself
diligently
to
the
study
of
the
law
intending
to
prove
to
himself
and
to
her
that
he
was
capable
of
toil
and
of
a
steady
aim
at
an
object
in
life
before
he
asked
her
to
decide
what
their
relation
to
each
other
was
henceforth
to
be
surely
said
he
you
might
have
discovered
this
much
from
my
letters
to
my
mother
and
how
were
we
to
know
what
was
in
your
letters
to
your
mother
do
you
mean
that
you
have
not
read
or
heard
them
all
this
time
not
a
word
for
these
three
months
we
have
scarcely
seen
her
for
many
weeks
past
and
then
she
merely
showed
us
what
long
letters
you
wrote
her
and
they
were
all
written
for
you
she
told
me
the
last
time
i
was
here
that
she
could
keep
nothing
from
you
and
relying
upon
her
words
i
have
supposed
this
to
be
a
medium
of
communication
between
us
throughout
i
could
have
no
other
you
know
when
did
my
mother
leave
off
reading
my
letters
to
you
from
the
week
you
went
away
last
mrs
rowland
came
in
while
we
were
in
the
midst
of
one
and
the
consequence
was
that
you
have
been
in
the
dark
about
me
ever
since
you
saw
that
i
did
write
yes
i
have
seen
most
of
the
and
the
interiors
upside
down
but
mrs
rowland
was
always
there
or
else
phoebe
and
have
you
really
known
nothing
about
me
whatever
little
george
told
me
that
you
had
lessons
to
learn
very
hard
and
very
long
and
if
possible
more
difficult
than
his
and
did
not
you
see
then
that
i
was
acting
upon
your
views
i
supposed
miss
bruce
might
have
had
them
first
miss
bruce
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
i
know
nothing
of
miss
bruce
views
on
any
subject
i
can
not
conceive
how
my
sister
got
such
a
notion
into
her
head
why
she
selected
her
margaret
was
going
to
mention
the
sisterly
affection
which
had
long
subsisted
between
miss
bruce
and
mrs
rowland
according
to
the
latter
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
just
possible
that
philip
might
not
be
altogether
so
indifferent
to
miss
bruce
as
miss
bruce
was
to
him
and
this
thought
sealed
her
lips
i
wonder
whether
rowland
believed
it
all
the
time
said
philip
and
hope
it
was
unworthy
of
hope
judgment
of
his
faith
to
view
the
case
so
wrongly
i
am
glad
you
are
beginning
to
be
angry
with
somebody
else
said
margaret
your
wrath
seemed
all
to
be
for
me
but
your
old
friends
even
to
your
mother
appear
to
have
had
no
doubt
about
the
matter
there
is
an
excuse
for
them
which
i
thought
you
had
not
i
am
an
altered
man
margaret
you
can
not
conceive
how
altered
since
i
began
to
know
you
they
judged
of
me
by
what
i
was
once
we
will
not
say
how
lately
i
assure
you
i
do
not
forget
the
accounts
you
used
to
give
of
yourself
what
accounts
of
how
you
found
life
pleasant
enough
without
philosophy
and
without
anything
to
do
and
other
wise
sayings
of
the
kind
it
is
by
such
things
that
those
who
knew
me
long
ago
have
judged
me
lately
a
retribution
which
i
ought
not
to
complain
of
if
they
believed
me
fickle
idle
selfish
it
is
all
fair
oh
margaret
men
know
nothing
of
morals
till
they
know
women
are
you
serious
i
am
solemnly
persuaded
of
it
happy
they
who
grow
up
beside
mothers
and
sisters
whom
they
can
revere
but
for
this
almost
all
men
would
be
without
earnestness
of
heart
without
a
moral
purpose
without
generosity
while
they
are
all
the
while
talking
of
honour
it
was
so
with
me
before
i
knew
you
i
am
feeble
enough
and
selfish
enough
yet
god
knows
but
i
hope
still
to
prove
that
you
have
made
a
man
of
me
out
of
a
light
selfish
but
what
right
have
i
you
may
think
to
ask
you
to
rely
upon
me
when
i
have
so
lately
been
what
i
tell
you
i
did
not
mean
to
ask
you
yet
this
very
morning
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
intentions
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
should
have
waited
before
i
should
have
dared
my
sister
has
rendered
me
an
inestimable
service
amidst
all
the
mischief
she
did
me
i
thank
her
ah
margaret
you
smile
margaret
smiled
again
the
smile
owned
that
she
was
thinking
the
same
thing
about
their
obligations
to
mrs
rowland
whatever
you
might
have
said
to
me
this
evening
continued
philip
if
your
regard
for
me
had
proved
to
have
been
quite
overthrown
if
you
had
continued
to
despise
me
as
you
must
have
done
at
times
i
should
still
have
blessed
you
all
my
life
i
should
have
worshipped
you
as
the
being
who
opened
a
new
world
to
me
you
lifted
me
out
of
a
life
of
trifling
of
trifling
which
i
thought
very
elegant
at
the
time
trifling
with
my
own
time
and
faculties
trifling
with
other
people
serious
business
trifling
with
something
more
serious
still
i
fear
with
their
feelings
as
far
as
i
remember
i
thought
all
this
manly
and
refined
enough
and
but
for
you
i
should
have
thought
so
still
you
early
opened
my
eyes
to
all
the
meanness
and
gross
selfishness
of
such
a
life
and
if
you
were
never
to
let
me
see
you
again
i
believe
i
could
not
fall
back
into
the
delusion
but
if
you
will
be
the
guide
of
my
life
margaret
sighed
deeply
even
at
this
moment
of
vital
happiness
her
thoughts
rested
on
her
sister
she
remembered
what
anticipations
had
been
in
prospect
of
having
edward
for
the
guide
of
her
life
i
frighten
you
i
see
said
philip
with
my
confessions
but
be
the
consequences
what
they
may
i
must
speak
margaret
if
you
despise
me
i
must
do
you
the
justice
and
give
myself
the
consolation
of
acknowledging
what
i
have
been
and
what
i
owe
to
you
it
is
not
that
said
margaret
let
the
past
go
let
it
be
forgotten
in
reaching
forward
to
better
things
but
do
not
let
us
be
confident
about
the
future
i
have
seen
too
much
of
that
we
must
not
provide
for
disappointment
let
us
leave
it
till
it
comes
surely
she
added
with
a
gentle
smile
we
have
enough
for
the
present
i
can
not
look
forward
yet
how
you
must
have
suffered
cried
philip
in
a
tone
of
grief
you
have
lost
some
of
your
confidence
love
you
did
not
cling
to
the
present
and
shrink
from
the
future
when
oh
it
is
bitter
even
now
to
think
that
while
i
was
working
on
in
hope
and
resolution
you
were
suffering
here
making
it
a
duty
to
extinguish
your
regard
for
me
i
all
the
time
toiling
to
deserve
it
and
there
was
no
one
to
set
us
right
and
the
whole
world
in
league
to
divide
us
that
is
all
over
now
but
not
the
consequences
margaret
they
have
shaken
you
they
have
made
you
know
doubt
and
fear
we
are
both
changed
philip
we
are
older
and
i
trust
it
will
appear
that
we
are
wiser
than
we
were
yes
older
there
are
times
in
life
when
days
do
the
work
of
years
and
our
days
have
been
of
that
kind
you
have
discovered
a
new
life
and
my
wishes
and
expectations
are
much
altered
they
may
not
be
fewer
or
less
bright
but
they
are
very
different
if
they
were
pure
from
fears
they
are
pure
from
fears
at
this
moment
i
can
fear
nothing
we
have
been
brought
together
by
the
unquestionable
providence
which
rules
our
lives
and
this
is
enough
the
present
is
all
right
and
the
future
which
is
to
come
out
of
it
will
be
all
right
in
its
way
i
have
no
fear
but
i
do
not
want
to
anticipate
this
hour
with
its
satisfactions
is
all
that
i
can
bear
notwithstanding
this
and
philip
transport
in
learning
it
they
did
go
back
again
and
again
into
the
past
and
many
a
glance
did
they
cast
into
the
future
there
was
no
end
to
their
revelations
of
the
circumstances
of
the
last
two
months
and
of
the
interior
history
which
belonged
to
them
at
last
the
burning
out
of
one
of
the
candles
startled
them
into
a
recollection
of
how
long
their
conversation
had
lasted
and
of
the
suspense
in
which
edward
and
hester
had
been
kept
enderby
offered
to
go
and
tell
them
the
fact
which
they
must
be
anticipating
and
after
having
agreed
that
no
one
else
should
know
at
present
that
miss
bruce
name
should
be
allowed
to
die
out
of
deerbrook
speculations
for
mrs
rowland
sake
before
any
other
was
put
in
its
place
philip
left
his
margaret
and
went
into
the
where
his
presence
was
not
wholly
unexpected
in
five
minutes
margaret
heard
the
hall
door
shut
and
in
another
moment
her
brother
and
sister
came
to
her
hester
face
was
all
smiles
and
tears
her
mind
all
tumult
with
the
vivid
recollection
of
her
own
first
hours
of
happy
hopeful
love
mingled
with
the
griefs
which
always
lay
heavy
within
her
and
with
that
warm
attachment
to
her
sister
which
circumstances
occasionally
exalted
into
a
passion
we
ought
to
rejoice
with
nothing
but
joy
margaret
said
she
but
i
can
not
see
how
we
are
to
spare
you
i
do
not
believe
i
can
live
without
you
her
husband
started
at
this
echo
of
the
thoughts
for
which
he
was
at
the
moment
painfully
rebuking
himself
he
had
nothing
to
say
but
gave
his
greeting
in
a
brotherly
kiss
like
that
which
he
had
offered
on
his
marriage
with
her
sister
and
on
his
entrance
upon
his
home
how
quiet
how
very
quiet
she
is
exclaimed
hester
an
margaret
left
the
room
after
a
few
words
on
the
events
of
the
evening
and
a
calm
i
hope
it
is
all
right
i
hope
she
is
quite
satisfied
satisfied
is
the
word
said
her
husband
people
are
quiet
when
they
are
relieved
calm
when
they
are
satisfied
people
like
margaret
it
is
only
great
minds
i
believe
which
feel
real
satisfaction
hester
gave
him
pain
by
a
deep
sigh
she
was
thinking
how
seldom
and
for
how
short
a
time
she
had
ever
felt
real
satisfaction
and
how
often
and
for
how
long
she
asked
do
great
minds
find
themselves
in
that
heaven
by
the
blessing
of
god
not
seldom
i
trust
replied
he
though
not
so
often
as
by
obeying
their
nature
they
might
intellectual
satisfaction
is
perhaps
not
for
this
world
except
in
a
few
of
the
inspired
hours
of
the
newtons
and
the
bacons
who
are
sent
to
teach
what
the
human
intellect
is
but
as
often
as
a
great
mind
meets
with
full
moral
sympathy
as
often
as
it
is
loved
in
return
for
love
as
often
as
it
confides
itself
unreservedly
to
the
good
power
which
bestowed
its
existence
and
appointed
all
its
attributes
i
imagine
it
must
repose
in
satisfaction
then
satisfaction
ought
to
be
no
new
feeling
to
margaret
said
hester
she
always
loves
every
one
she
meets
with
sympathy
wherever
she
turns
and
i
believe
she
has
faith
enough
for
a
martyr
without
knowing
it
ought
not
she
must
not
she
have
often
felt
real
satisfaction
yes
i
wonder
you
dole
out
your
words
so
sparingly
about
such
a
being
as
margaret
said
hester
resentfully
i
can
tell
you
edward
though
you
take
so
coolly
the
privilege
of
having
such
a
one
so
nearly
connected
with
you
you
might
search
the
world
in
vain
for
her
equal
you
little
know
the
wealth
of
her
heart
and
soul
edward
i
ask
you
whether
she
does
not
deserve
to
feel
full
satisfaction
of
conscience
and
affections
and
you
just
answer
with
as
much
languor
as
if
i
had
asked
you
whether
the
clock
has
struck
eleven
yet
i
can
tell
you
this
i
have
said
in
my
own
heart
and
just
to
morris
for
years
that
the
happiest
man
of
his
generation
will
be
he
who
has
margaret
for
a
wife
and
here
you
who
ought
to
know
this
give
me
a
grudging
in
answer
to
the
first
question
arising
out
of
my
reverence
for
margaret
that
i
ever
asked
you
you
mistake
me
replied
hope
in
a
tone
of
gentleness
which
touched
her
very
soul
one
words
may
be
restrained
by
reverence
as
well
as
by
want
of
heart
i
regard
margaret
with
a
reverence
which
i
should
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
put
into
words
for
your
conviction
oh
i
am
wrong
as
i
always
am
cried
hester
you
must
forgive
me
again
as
you
do
far
far
too
often
but
tell
me
edward
ought
not
margaret
husband
to
be
the
happiest
man
living
yes
said
edward
with
a
smile
will
that
do
this
time
oh
yes
yes
replied
she
the
thought
passing
through
her
mind
that
whether
or
not
her
husband
excepted
himself
as
a
matter
of
course
she
should
not
have
asked
a
question
to
which
she
could
not
bear
all
possible
answers
even
if
he
meant
that
margaret
husband
might
be
a
happier
man
than
himself
it
was
only
too
true
as
quick
as
lightning
these
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
and
apparently
without
a
pause
she
went
on
and
now
as
to
enderby
is
he
worthy
to
be
this
happy
husband
does
he
deserve
her
mr
hope
did
pause
before
he
replied
i
think
we
had
better
dwell
as
little
as
we
can
on
that
point
of
the
story
not
because
i
am
afraid
do
not
take
fright
and
suppose
i
mean
more
than
i
say
not
because
i
am
afraid
but
because
we
can
do
nothing
discern
nothing
about
it
time
must
show
what
enderby
is
or
rather
what
he
has
the
power
of
becoming
meanwhile
the
thing
is
settled
they
love
and
have
promised
and
are
happy
let
us
shun
all
comparison
of
the
one
with
the
other
of
them
and
hope
everything
from
him
there
will
be
some
amusement
said
hester
after
a
smiling
reverie
in
having
this
secret
to
ourselves
for
a
time
while
all
the
rest
of
deerbrook
is
so
busy
with
a
different
idea
and
expectation
how
mrs
rowland
bear
it
mrs
grey
might
have
said
that
said
hope
laughing
well
but
is
it
not
true
will
it
not
be
very
amusing
to
see
the
circulation
of
stories
about
miss
bruce
given
the
best
authority
and
to
have
all
manner
of
news
told
us
about
philip
and
to
watch
how
mrs
rowland
will
get
out
of
the
scrape
she
is
in
surely
edward
you
are
not
above
being
amused
with
all
this
i
shall
be
best
pleased
when
it
is
all
over
i
have
lived
some
years
longer
than
you
in
deerbrook
and
have
had
more
time
to
get
tired
of
its
mysteries
and
mistakes
for
your
comfort
then
it
can
not
be
long
before
all
is
open
and
rightly
understood
we
need
only
leave
mrs
rowland
time
to
extricate
herself
i
suppose
i
wonder
how
she
will
manage
it
we
shall
be
taken
by
surprise
with
some
clever
device
i
dare
say
it
is
a
pity
so
much
ingenuity
should
be
wasted
on
mischief
chapter
twenty
seven
a
morning
in
march
margaret
was
as
calm
as
she
appeared
to
be
to
a
nature
like
hers
blissful
repose
was
congenial
and
anxiety
both
appeared
and
felt
unnatural
in
her
there
was
no
weak
wonder
that
providence
had
blessed
her
as
she
felt
she
was
blessed
while
she
suffered
she
concluded
with
certainty
that
the
suffering
was
for
some
good
purpose
but
no
degree
of
happiness
took
her
by
surprise
or
seemed
other
than
a
natural
influence
shed
by
the
great
parent
into
the
souls
of
his
children
she
had
of
late
been
fearfully
shaken
not
in
her
faith
but
in
her
serenity
in
a
moment
this
experience
appeared
like
a
sick
dream
and
her
present
certainty
of
being
beloved
spread
its
calm
over
her
spirit
somewhat
as
her
nightly
devotions
had
done
from
her
childhood
upwards
even
now
it
was
little
that
she
thought
of
herself
her
recovered
philip
filled
her
mind
he
who
had
been
a
stranger
who
had
been
living
in
a
world
of
which
she
could
conceive
nothing
who
had
suddenly
vanished
from
her
companionship
as
if
an
earthquake
had
swallowed
him
up
and
who
was
now
all
her
own
again
by
her
side
and
to
be
lived
for
amidst
this
security
this
natural
and
delightful
state
of
things
that
restless
uneasiness
now
jealousy
and
now
which
she
had
called
her
own
vanity
and
selfishness
disappeared
and
she
felt
like
one
who
has
escaped
from
the
horrors
of
a
feverish
bed
into
the
cool
fragrant
airs
and
mild
sunshine
of
the
early
morning
anxieties
soon
arose
gentle
doubts
expressing
themselves
in
soft
sighs
which
were
so
endeared
by
the
love
from
which
they
sprang
that
she
would
not
have
banished
them
if
she
could
anxieties
lest
she
should
be
insufficient
for
philip
happiness
lest
he
should
overrate
the
peace
of
home
which
she
now
knew
was
not
to
be
looked
for
in
full
measure
there
any
more
than
in
other
scenes
of
human
probation
gentle
questionings
like
these
there
were
but
they
tended
rather
to
preserve
than
to
disturb
her
calmness
of
spirit
misery
had
broken
her
sleep
by
night
and
constrained
her
conduct
by
day
happy
love
restored
her
at
once
to
her
natural
mood
lulling
her
to
the
deepest
rest
when
she
rested
and
rendering
her
free
and
in
all
the
employments
and
intercourses
of
life
there
was
one
person
who
must
not
be
kept
waiting
for
this
intelligence
till
mrs
rowland
return
as
margaret
told
philip
and
that
was
maria
philip
heart
was
now
overflowing
with
kindness
towards
all
whom
margaret
loved
and
he
spoke
with
strong
interest
of
maria
of
her
virtues
her
misfortunes
and
the
grace
and
promise
which
once
bloomed
in
her
you
knew
her
before
her
misfortunes
then
to
be
sure
i
did
that
was
the
time
when
i
did
know
her
for
as
you
may
perceive
there
is
not
much
opportunity
now
and
besides
she
is
so
totally
changed
that
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
i
understand
her
feelings
i
am
too
much
in
awe
of
them
to
approach
her
very
nearly
oh
yes
i
knew
maria
young
once
much
better
than
i
know
her
now
she
never
told
me
so
how
very
strange
does
she
ever
speak
of
any
other
circumstance
of
her
prosperous
days
that
is
true
only
incidentally
time
was
said
philip
when
some
boyish
dreams
connected
themselves
with
maria
young
only
transiently
and
quite
at
the
bottom
of
my
own
fancy
i
never
spoke
of
them
to
any
one
before
nor
fully
acknowledged
them
to
myself
she
was
the
first
sensible
woman
i
ever
knew
the
first
who
conveyed
to
me
any
conception
of
what
the
moral
nature
of
a
woman
may
be
under
favourable
circumstances
for
this
i
am
under
great
obligations
to
her
and
this
is
all
the
feeling
that
i
brought
out
of
our
intercourse
it
might
possibly
have
come
to
more
but
that
i
disliked
her
father
excessively
and
left
off
going
there
on
that
account
what
a
selfish
wretch
i
was
in
those
days
i
can
hardly
believe
it
now
but
i
distinctly
remember
rejoicing
on
hearing
of
her
accident
that
my
esteem
for
her
had
not
passed
into
a
warmer
feeling
as
i
should
then
have
suffered
so
much
on
her
account
is
it
possible
cried
margaret
who
in
the
midst
of
the
unpleasant
feeling
excited
by
this
fact
did
not
fail
to
remark
to
herself
that
there
could
have
been
no
love
in
such
a
case
i
ought
for
my
own
sake
however
margaret
to
say
that
maria
young
had
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
her
influence
over
me
superficial
and
transient
as
it
was
i
never
conveyed
it
to
her
by
word
or
act
and
i
am
thankful
i
did
not
for
this
reason
among
many
that
i
am
now
perfectly
free
to
show
her
all
the
kindness
she
deserves
both
from
her
own
merits
and
from
her
being
a
beloved
friend
of
yours
margaret
had
no
doubt
of
philip
full
conviction
of
what
he
was
saying
but
she
was
far
from
certain
that
he
was
not
mistaken
that
looks
and
tones
might
not
have
communicated
what
words
and
acts
had
been
forbidden
to
convey
she
thought
of
maria
silence
about
her
former
acquaintance
with
philip
of
her
surprising
knowledge
of
his
thoughts
and
ways
betraying
itself
to
a
vigilant
observer
through
the
most
trivial
conversation
and
of
her
confession
that
there
had
been
an
attachment
to
some
one
and
thinking
of
these
things
her
heart
melted
within
her
for
her
friend
she
silently
resolved
upon
the
only
method
she
could
think
of
to
spare
her
feelings
she
would
write
the
news
of
this
engagement
instead
of
going
to
tell
it
as
she
had
intended
she
was
confident
that
it
would
be
no
surprise
to
maria
but
maria
should
have
time
and
solitude
in
which
to
reconcile
herself
to
it
what
was
to
be
done
about
mrs
enderby
she
had
been
told
at
once
on
philip
arrival
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
about
miss
bruce
and
she
had
appeared
relieved
when
freed
from
the
image
of
an
unknown
philip
and
margaret
agreed
that
they
must
deny
themselves
the
pleasure
of
revealing
the
rest
of
the
truth
to
her
till
it
had
been
inflicted
upon
mrs
rowland
mrs
enderby
would
never
be
able
to
keep
it
from
the
greys
and
she
would
be
disturbed
and
alarmed
in
the
expectation
of
the
scenes
which
might
ensue
when
mrs
rowland
should
discover
that
her
brother
meant
to
choose
his
wife
for
himself
instead
of
taking
one
of
her
selection
margaret
must
go
and
see
his
mother
as
often
as
possible
but
her
new
interest
in
her
old
friend
must
be
concealed
for
the
present
how
margaret
motherless
for
so
many
long
years
felt
her
heart
yearn
towards
the
old
lady
who
seemed
to
be
everybody
charge
but
whom
she
felt
now
to
be
a
sacred
object
of
her
care
the
lovers
immediately
experienced
some
of
the
evils
attendant
on
concealment
in
the
difficulty
of
meeting
as
freely
as
they
wished
there
was
the
at
mr
hope
for
them
and
by
a
little
management
on
the
part
of
brother
and
sister
a
branching
off
in
country
walks
out
of
sight
of
the
good
people
of
deerbrook
in
company
too
they
were
always
together
and
without
awkwardness
true
lovers
do
not
want
to
talk
together
in
company
they
had
rather
not
it
is
enough
to
be
in
mutual
presence
and
they
have
nothing
to
say
at
such
times
and
prefer
joining
in
what
everybody
else
is
saying
when
philip
had
once
put
a
stop
to
all
congratulations
about
miss
bruce
by
earnestly
and
most
respectfully
though
gaily
releasing
that
lady
name
from
all
connection
with
his
own
no
further
awkwardness
remained
he
treated
the
affair
as
one
of
the
false
reports
which
are
circulating
every
day
and
left
it
for
his
sister
to
explain
how
she
had
been
misled
by
it
it
was
amusing
to
the
family
to
see
that
mrs
grey
and
sophia
insisted
on
believing
that
either
mr
enderby
was
a
rejected
lover
of
miss
bruce
or
that
it
had
been
an
engagement
which
was
now
broken
off
or
that
it
would
soon
be
an
engagement
the
gay
state
of
spirits
accorded
best
with
the
latter
supposition
but
this
gaiety
might
be
assumed
to
cover
his
mortification
margaret
was
daily
made
a
listener
to
one
or
other
of
these
suppositions
one
bright
mild
march
day
hester
and
margaret
were
accompanying
philip
to
mr
rowland
to
call
on
mrs
enderby
when
they
met
mr
rowland
in
the
street
returned
the
evening
before
from
cheltenham
ladies
your
most
obedient
said
he
stopping
up
the
path
before
them
i
was
on
my
way
to
call
on
you
but
if
you
will
step
in
to
see
mrs
enderby
we
can
have
our
chat
there
and
he
at
once
offered
his
arm
to
margaret
bestowing
a
meaning
smile
on
hester
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
on
their
way
he
entered
at
once
on
the
compliments
it
had
been
his
errand
to
pay
but
spoke
for
himself
alone
i
did
not
write
said
he
because
i
expected
to
deliver
my
good
wishes
in
person
so
soon
but
they
are
not
the
less
hearty
for
being
a
little
delayed
i
find
however
that
i
am
still
beforehand
with
my
neighbours
that
even
mrs
enderby
does
not
know
nor
my
family
all
in
good
time
but
i
am
sorry
for
this
mistake
about
the
lady
it
is
rather
awkward
i
do
not
know
where
mrs
rowland
got
her
information
or
what
induced
her
to
rely
so
implicitly
upon
it
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
duly
warned
her
to
be
sure
of
her
news
before
she
regularly
announced
it
but
i
believe
such
reports
oftener
unfounded
than
true
have
been
the
annoyance
of
young
people
ever
since
there
has
been
marriage
and
giving
in
marriage
we
have
all
suffered
in
our
turn
i
dare
say
though
the
case
is
not
always
so
broad
an
one
as
come
mr
philip
what
are
you
about
standing
there
and
keeping
the
ladies
standing
and
i
do
believe
you
have
not
knocked
our
doors
do
not
open
of
themselves
though
it
be
to
let
in
the
most
welcome
guests
in
the
world
now
ladies
will
you
walk
in
philip
will
prepare
mrs
enderby
to
expect
you
and
meanwhile
let
me
show
you
what
a
splendid
jonquil
we
have
in
blow
here
the
day
was
so
mild
and
the
sun
shone
into
the
house
so
pleasantly
that
mrs
enderby
had
been
permitted
to
leave
her
chamber
and
establish
herself
for
the
day
in
the
there
she
was
found
in
a
flutter
of
pleasure
at
the
change
of
scene
matilda
canary
sang
in
the
sunshine
philip
had
filled
the
window
with
flowering
plants
for
his
mother
and
the
whole
room
was
fragrant
with
his
hyacinths
the
little
greys
had
sent
mrs
enderby
a
bunch
of
violets
phoebe
had
made
bold
while
the
gardener
was
at
breakfast
to
abstract
a
bough
from
the
almond
tree
on
the
grass
and
its
pink
blossoms
now
decked
the
mantelpiece
these
things
were
almost
too
much
for
the
old
lady
her
black
eyes
looked
rather
too
bright
and
her
pale
thin
face
twitched
when
she
spoke
she
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
goodness
of
everybody
to
her
and
said
it
was
almost
worth
while
being
ever
so
ill
to
find
one
self
so
kindly
regarded
it
rejoiced
her
to
see
her
friends
around
her
again
in
this
way
it
was
quite
a
meeting
of
friends
again
if
only
her
dear
priscilla
and
the
sweet
children
had
been
here
it
was
a
great
drawback
certainly
their
being
away
but
she
hoped
they
would
soon
be
back
if
they
had
been
here
there
would
have
been
nothing
left
to
wish
hester
asked
if
mr
hope
had
visited
her
this
morning
she
had
rather
expected
to
meet
him
here
and
had
brought
something
for
him
which
he
had
wished
very
much
to
have
a
letter
from
his
brother
in
india
she
was
impatient
till
it
was
in
his
hands
had
he
made
his
call
or
might
she
expect
him
presently
mrs
enderby
seemed
to
find
difficulty
in
comprehending
the
question
and
then
she
could
not
recollect
whether
mr
hope
had
paid
his
visit
this
morning
or
not
she
grew
nervous
at
her
own
confusion
of
mind
talked
faster
than
ever
and
at
last
when
the
canary
sang
out
a
sudden
loud
strain
she
burst
into
tears
we
are
too
much
for
her
said
hester
let
us
go
we
have
been
very
wrong
yes
go
said
philip
and
send
phoebe
you
will
find
your
way
into
the
garden
and
i
will
join
you
there
presently
rowland
you
will
go
with
them
margaret
cast
a
beseeching
look
at
philip
and
he
gratefully
permitted
her
to
stay
hester
carried
off
the
canary
margaret
drew
down
the
blinds
and
then
kneeled
by
mrs
enderby
soothing
and
speaking
cheerfully
to
her
while
tears
called
up
by
a
strange
mixture
of
emotions
were
raining
down
her
cheeks
philip
stood
by
the
mantelpiece
weeping
without
restraint
the
first
time
that
margaret
had
ever
seen
tears
from
him
i
am
a
silly
old
woman
said
mrs
enderby
half
laughing
in
the
midst
of
her
sobs
here
comes
phoebe
phoebe
i
have
been
very
silly
and
i
hardly
know
what
about
i
declare
my
dear
she
exclaimed
as
she
felt
tears
drop
upon
the
hand
which
margaret
was
chafing
my
dear
miss
ibbotson
oh
call
me
margaret
but
my
dear
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
the
matter
after
all
something
has
happened
oh
dear
no
said
phoebe
only
we
do
like
to
see
you
in
this
way
there
is
nothing
the
matter
i
assure
you
said
margaret
we
were
too
much
for
you
we
tired
you
and
we
are
very
sorry
that
is
all
but
the
room
will
be
kept
quite
quiet
now
and
you
will
soon
feel
better
i
am
better
my
dear
thank
you
how
are
you
sitting
so
low
bless
me
you
are
kneeling
pray
my
dear
rise
to
think
of
your
kneeling
to
take
care
of
me
give
me
one
kiss
and
i
will
rise
said
margaret
bending
over
her
it
was
a
hearty
kiss
which
mrs
enderby
gave
her
for
the
old
lady
put
all
her
energy
into
it
margaret
rose
satisfied
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
accepted
for
a
daughter
as
soon
as
mrs
enderby
appeared
disposed
to
shut
her
eyes
and
lie
quiet
philip
and
margaret
withdrew
leaving
her
to
phoebe
care
they
sauntered
about
the
walks
till
they
came
upon
hester
and
mr
rowland
who
were
sitting
in
the
sun
under
the
shelter
of
an
evergreen
hedge
have
you
heard
nothing
of
my
husband
yet
asked
hester
i
do
wish
he
would
come
and
read
this
letter
from
frank
her
anxiety
is
purely
disinterested
said
margaret
to
philip
there
can
be
nothing
about
her
in
that
letter
his
greetings
to
her
will
come
in
the
next
edward
enjoys
frank
letters
above
everything
observed
hester
suppose
you
go
in
next
door
and
we
will
send
hope
to
you
when
he
comes
said
philip
intending
thus
to
set
mr
rowland
free
to
dismiss
hester
and
have
margaret
to
himself
for
a
garden
walk
the
greys
are
all
out
for
the
day
observed
mr
rowland
my
partner
and
all
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
to
you
ladies
for
wishing
you
a
good
morning
there
is
a
lighter
at
the
wharf
down
there
whose
lading
waits
for
me
ay
go
said
philip
we
have
detained
you
long
enough
we
will
find
our
way
by
some
means
into
the
greys
grounds
and
amuse
ourselves
there
if
you
will
bid
one
of
your
people
call
us
when
hope
comes
we
shall
hear
by
the
help
of
an
overturned
wheelbarrow
and
some
activity
and
at
the
expense
of
a
very
little
detriment
to
the
hedge
the
ladies
were
presently
landed
on
mr
grey
territories
by
common
consent
the
three
directed
their
steps
towards
the
end
of
the
green
walk
whence
might
be
seen
the
prospect
of
which
the
sisters
were
never
tired
a
purple
and
golden
crocus
peeped
up
here
and
there
from
the
turf
of
this
walk
there
was
a
wilderness
of
daffodils
on
either
side
the
blossoms
just
bursting
from
their
green
sheaths
the
periwinkle
with
its
starry
flowers
and
dark
shining
sprays
overran
the
borders
and
the
hedge
which
bounded
the
walk
was
red
with
swollen
buds
as
the
gazers
leaned
on
this
compact
hedge
they
overlooked
a
wide
extent
of
country
they
stood
on
a
sort
of
terrace
and
below
them
was
the
field
where
the
greys
pet
animals
were
wont
to
range
the
old
pony
trotted
towards
the
terrace
as
if
expecting
notice
fanny
and
mary
lambs
approached
and
looked
up
as
awaiting
something
good
philip
amused
himself
and
them
with
odd
noises
but
had
nothing
better
for
them
and
so
they
soon
scampered
off
the
pony
throwing
out
his
hind
legs
as
if
in
indignation
at
his
bad
entertainment
beyond
this
field
a
few
white
cottages
in
the
rear
of
the
village
peeped
out
from
the
lanes
and
seemed
to
sit
down
to
rest
in
the
meadows
so
profound
was
the
repose
which
they
seemed
to
express
the
river
wound
quietly
through
the
green
level
filling
its
channel
and
looking
pearly
under
the
light
spring
sky
and
behind
it
the
woods
uprose
their
softened
masses
and
outlines
prophesying
of
leafy
summer
shades
near
at
hand
the
air
was
alive
with
twitterings
afar
off
nature
seemed
asleep
and
nothing
was
seen
to
move
but
the
broad
sail
of
a
wherry
and
a
diminished
figure
of
a
man
beside
his
horse
in
a
distant
green
field
hester
judged
rightly
that
the
lovers
would
like
to
have
this
scene
to
themselves
and
having
surveyed
it
with
that
sigh
of
delight
with
which
spring
causes
the
heart
to
swell
she
softly
stole
away
and
sauntered
down
the
green
walk
she
proceeded
till
she
reached
a
bench
whence
she
could
gaze
upon
the
grey
old
church
tower
rising
between
the
intervening
trees
and
at
the
same
time
overlook
mr
rowland
garden
she
had
not
sat
many
minutes
before
her
husband
leaped
the
hedge
and
bounded
over
the
grass
towards
her
what
news
cried
he
there
is
good
news
in
your
face
there
is
good
news
in
my
bag
i
trust
and
she
produced
the
large
square
epistle
marked
ship
letter
in
those
red
characters
which
have
a
peculiar
power
of
making
the
heart
beat
she
did
not
wonder
that
her
husband
changed
colour
as
she
held
up
the
letter
she
knew
that
the
arrival
of
news
from
frank
was
a
great
event
in
life
to
edward
she
gloried
in
being
for
the
first
time
the
medium
through
which
this
rare
pleasure
reached
him
and
she
longed
to
share
for
the
first
time
the
confidence
of
a
brother
margaret
had
for
some
months
reposed
upon
the
possession
of
a
brother
she
was
now
to
have
the
same
privilege
she
made
room
upon
the
bench
for
her
husband
and
proposed
to
lose
no
time
in
reading
the
letter
together
but
hope
did
not
sit
down
though
from
his
agitation
she
would
have
supposed
him
glad
of
a
seat
he
said
he
would
read
in
the
shrubbery
and
walked
slowly
away
breaking
the
seal
as
he
went
hester
was
rather
disconcerted
but
she
suppressed
her
disappointment
begged
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
bench
and
herself
retired
into
the
orchard
while
he
read
his
epistle
there
as
she
stood
apparently
amusing
herself
by
the
pond
wiping
away
a
tear
or
two
which
would
have
way
she
little
imagined
what
agony
her
husband
was
enduring
from
this
letter
which
she
was
supposing
must
make
his
heart
overflow
with
pleasure
the
letter
was
half
full
of
reply
to
edward
account
of
margaret
in
his
epistle
of
last
june
of
raillery
about
her
of
intreaty
that
edward
would
give
him
such
a
and
of
intimations
that
nothing
could
be
more
apparent
than
that
the
whole
rich
treasure
of
his
heart
love
was
margaret
own
hope
soul
sickened
as
he
read
with
that
deadly
sickness
which
he
had
believed
was
past
but
last
june
with
its
delights
and
opening
love
was
too
suddenly
and
too
vividly
in
his
memory
and
imagination
the
margaret
of
yesterday
of
last
month
he
trusted
he
had
arrived
at
regarding
as
a
sister
not
so
the
margaret
of
last
summer
in
vain
he
repeated
again
and
again
to
himself
that
he
had
expected
this
that
he
always
knew
it
must
come
that
this
was
the
very
thing
and
no
more
that
he
had
been
dreading
for
half
a
year
past
that
it
was
over
now
that
he
ought
to
rejoice
that
he
held
in
his
hand
the
last
witness
and
reminder
of
the
mistake
of
his
life
in
vain
did
he
repeat
to
himself
these
reasonable
things
these
satisfactory
truths
they
did
not
still
the
throbbing
of
his
brain
or
relieve
the
agony
of
his
spirit
an
agony
under
which
he
could
almost
have
cursed
the
hilarity
of
his
brother
as
levity
and
his
hearty
affection
as
cruel
mockery
he
recovered
some
breath
and
composure
when
he
read
the
latter
half
of
frank
volume
of
communication
and
before
he
had
finished
it
the
sound
of
distant
footsteps
fell
upon
his
excited
ear
he
knew
they
were
coming
the
three
who
would
be
full
of
expectation
as
to
what
he
should
have
to
tell
them
from
india
it
was
they
walking
very
slowly
as
if
waiting
for
the
news
come
said
he
starting
up
and
going
to
meet
them
now
to
the
green
walk
we
shall
be
quiet
there
and
i
will
read
you
all
about
frank
he
did
read
them
all
about
frank
all
the
last
half
of
the
letter
hester
hanging
on
his
arm
and
philip
and
margaret
listening
as
if
they
were
taking
in
their
share
of
family
news
when
it
was
done
and
some
one
said
it
was
time
to
be
turning
homewards
hope
disengaged
his
arm
from
hester
and
ran
off
saying
that
he
would
report
of
mrs
enderby
to
mr
rowland
in
the
office
and
meet
them
before
they
should
be
out
of
the
shrubbery
he
did
so
but
he
first
took
his
way
round
by
a
fence
which
was
undergoing
the
operation
of
tarring
thrust
frank
letter
into
the
fire
over
which
the
tar
was
heating
and
saw
every
inch
of
it
consumed
before
he
proceeded
when
he
regained
his
party
hester
took
his
arm
and
turned
once
more
towards
the
shrubbery
saying
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
i
am
not
at
all
tired
so
now
read
me
the
rest
my
love
i
have
read
you
all
i
can
hester
stopped
short
and
with
flashing
eyes
whose
fire
was
scarcely
dimmed
by
her
tears
cried
do
you
mean
to
give
me
no
more
of
your
confidence
than
others
is
your
wife
my
dear
it
is
not
my
confidence
it
is
frank
and
is
not
frank
my
brother
he
is
nothing
to
them
he
was
not
your
brother
when
this
letter
was
written
nor
did
he
know
that
he
should
ever
be
so
consider
this
letter
as
one
of
old
time
as
belonging
to
the
antiquity
of
our
separate
lives
i
hope
there
will
never
be
another
letter
from
frank
or
anybody
else
out
of
the
range
of
my
professional
affairs
whose
contents
will
not
be
as
much
yours
as
mine
this
must
satisfy
you
now
hester
for
i
can
tell
you
no
more
this
ought
to
satisfy
you
it
does
not
satisfy
me
i
never
will
be
satisfied
with
giving
all
and
having
nothing
in
return
i
have
given
you
all
not
a
thought
has
there
been
in
my
heart
about
margaret
from
the
day
we
married
that
i
have
not
imparted
to
you
has
it
not
been
so
i
believe
it
and
i
thank
you
for
it
and
what
is
it
to
you
to
have
a
sister
you
who
have
always
had
sisters
what
is
it
to
you
in
comparison
with
my
longing
to
have
a
brother
and
now
you
make
him
no
more
mine
than
he
is
margaret
and
philip
he
himself
if
he
has
the
heart
of
a
brother
would
cry
out
upon
you
for
disappointing
me
i
can
allow
for
your
feelings
hester
i
have
known
too
well
what
disappointment
is
not
to
feel
for
you
but
here
the
fault
is
not
mine
whose
is
it
then
it
is
to
be
charged
upon
providence
i
suppose
like
most
of
our
evils
no
hester
i
charge
it
upon
you
the
disappointment
was
unavoidable
but
the
sting
of
it
lies
in
yourself
you
are
unreasonable
it
is
at
your
own
request
that
i
remind
you
to
be
reasonable
and
when
was
that
request
made
when
i
believed
that
you
would
hold
me
your
friend
that
no
others
were
to
come
near
my
place
in
your
confidence
that
all
you
cared
for
was
to
be
equally
mine
that
your
brother
himself
was
to
be
my
brother
it
was
when
you
promised
me
these
things
that
i
put
my
conscience
and
my
feelings
into
your
charge
but
now
all
that
is
over
you
are
as
much
alone
in
your
own
soul
as
ever
and
i
am
thrust
out
from
it
as
if
you
were
like
other
men
oh
she
cried
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
call
me
your
housekeeper
at
once
for
i
am
not
your
wife
and
breathe
not
upon
my
conscience
look
not
into
my
heart
for
what
are
they
to
you
i
reclaim
from
you
as
your
servant
the
power
i
gave
you
over
my
soul
when
i
supposed
i
was
to
be
your
wife
now
you
must
hear
me
hester
sit
down
for
you
can
not
stand
under
the
tempest
of
your
own
feelings
now
what
are
the
facts
out
of
which
all
this
has
arisen
i
have
had
a
letter
written
before
we
were
known
to
be
engaged
containing
something
which
is
confided
to
my
honour
we
had
both
rather
that
such
had
not
been
the
case
would
you
now
have
me
violate
my
honour
let
us
have
done
the
supposition
is
too
ridiculous
but
the
manner
pleaded
hester
it
is
not
curiosity
about
the
letter
i
care
nothing
if
it
contained
the
affairs
of
twenty
nations
but
oh
your
manner
was
cruel
if
you
loved
me
as
you
once
did
you
could
not
treat
me
exactly
as
you
treat
margaret
and
philip
you
do
not
love
me
as
you
once
did
you
do
not
answer
me
she
continued
in
a
tone
of
wretchedness
nay
do
not
answer
me
now
it
will
not
satisfy
me
to
hear
you
say
upon
compulsion
that
you
love
me
ah
i
had
margaret
once
and
once
i
had
you
philip
has
taken
my
margaret
from
me
and
if
you
despise
me
i
will
lie
down
and
die
fear
not
said
hope
with
great
solemnity
while
i
live
you
shall
be
honoured
and
have
such
rest
as
you
will
allow
to
your
own
heart
but
do
you
not
see
that
you
have
now
been
distrusting
me
not
i
you
shall
i
begin
to
question
whether
you
love
me
could
you
complain
of
injustice
if
i
did
when
you
have
been
tempting
my
honour
insulting
my
trust
in
you
and
wounding
my
soul
is
this
the
love
you
imagine
i
can
not
estimate
and
return
this
is
madness
hester
rouse
yourself
from
it
waken
up
the
most
generous
part
of
yourself
we
shall
both
have
need
of
it
all
oh
god
what
do
you
intend
consider
again
before
you
break
my
heart
if
you
mean
to
say
that
we
must
edward
forgive
me
edward
i
mean
to
say
that
we
must
support
each
other
under
troubles
of
sending
instead
of
creating
woes
of
our
own
support
each
other
thank
heaven
i
see
how
your
spirit
rouses
itself
at
the
first
sound
of
threatening
from
without
i
knew
it
would
rough
and
trying
times
are
coming
love
and
i
must
have
your
support
trouble
is
coming
daily
and
hourly
annoyance
and
no
end
of
it
that
i
can
see
and
poverty
perhaps
instead
of
the
ease
to
which
we
looked
forward
when
you
married
me
i
do
not
ask
you
whether
you
can
bear
these
things
for
i
know
you
can
i
shall
look
to
you
to
help
me
to
keep
my
temper
are
you
not
mocking
me
doubtfully
whispered
hester
no
my
love
her
husband
replied
looking
calmly
in
her
face
i
know
you
to
be
a
friend
made
for
adversity
let
it
come
then
exclaimed
she
and
she
felt
herself
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
life
in
which
all
the
past
might
yet
be
redeemed
they
soon
rejoined
margaret
and
went
home
to
relate
and
to
hear
what
new
threats
the
day
had
disclosed
chapter
twenty
eight
deerbrook
commotions
among
many
vague
threats
there
was
one
pretty
definite
menace
which
had
encountered
hope
from
various
quarters
of
late
by
whose
agency
and
by
what
means
he
did
not
know
but
he
apprehended
a
design
to
supplant
him
in
his
practice
there
was
something
more
meant
than
that
mr
foster
from
blickley
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
the
village
hope
imagined
that
there
was
a
looking
forward
to
somebody
else
who
was
to
cure
all
maladies
as
soon
as
they
appeared
and
keep
death
at
a
distance
from
deerbrook
it
seemed
to
be
among
the
poor
people
chiefly
that
such
an
expectation
prevailed
philip
was
sure
that
mr
rowland
knew
nothing
of
it
nor
mrs
enderby
mr
grey
when
spoken
to
did
not
believe
it
but
would
quietly
and
discreetly
inquire
mrs
grey
was
sure
that
the
deerbrook
people
would
not
venture
to
discountenance
altogether
any
one
who
had
married
into
their
connection
so
decidedly
her
young
folks
were
to
hear
nothing
of
the
matter
as
it
would
not
do
to
propagate
an
idea
which
might
bring
about
its
own
accomplishment
at
the
almshouses
the
threat
had
been
spoken
plainly
enough
and
hope
had
found
his
visit
there
a
very
unpleasant
one
it
had
been
wholly
disagreeable
when
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
houses
a
stone
had
been
thrown
at
him
from
behind
a
hedge
it
narrowly
missed
him
a
little
further
on
there
was
another
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
this
indication
was
not
to
be
mistaken
hope
leaped
his
horse
over
a
gate
and
rode
about
the
field
to
discover
who
had
attacked
him
for
some
time
he
could
see
no
one
but
on
looking
more
closely
to
the
fence
he
saw
signs
in
one
part
that
hedging
was
going
on
as
he
approached
the
spot
a
labourer
rose
up
from
the
ditch
and
was
suddenly
very
busy
at
his
work
he
looked
stupid
and
denied
having
thrown
any
stones
but
admitted
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
field
that
he
knew
of
further
on
more
stones
were
thrown
it
was
evidently
a
conspiracy
but
hope
could
find
no
one
to
call
to
account
for
it
but
an
old
woman
in
one
case
and
two
boys
in
as
he
rode
up
to
the
almshouses
the
aged
inmates
came
out
to
their
doors
or
looked
from
their
fanciful
gothic
windows
with
every
indication
of
displeasure
in
their
faces
and
manner
the
old
women
shook
their
heads
at
him
and
some
their
fists
the
old
men
shook
their
sticks
at
him
he
stopped
to
speak
to
one
man
of
who
was
sitting
in
the
sun
at
his
door
but
he
could
get
no
answer
out
of
him
nothing
but
growls
about
the
doctor
being
a
pretty
doctor
not
to
have
mended
his
yet
not
a
bit
better
could
he
see
now
than
he
could
a
year
ago
with
all
the
doctoring
he
had
had
and
now
the
gentleman
would
not
try
anything
more
a
pretty
doctor
indeed
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
there
would
be
another
who
would
cure
poor
people
eyes
as
if
they
were
rich
and
poor
people
eyes
were
as
precious
to
them
as
rich
he
next
went
into
a
house
where
an
aged
woman
was
confined
to
bed
with
rheumatism
but
her
gossips
stopped
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
would
not
let
him
approach
her
for
fear
he
should
be
her
death
as
she
had
been
lying
awake
the
night
before
she
had
heard
her
deceased
husband
shoes
dance
of
their
own
accord
in
the
closet
and
this
was
a
sign
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
somebody
she
thought
of
the
doctor
at
the
time
and
prayed
that
he
might
be
kept
from
coming
near
her
for
she
knew
he
would
be
the
death
of
her
somehow
as
he
had
been
of
other
folks
so
hope
was
obliged
to
leave
her
and
her
rheumatism
to
the
gossips
the
particular
object
of
his
visit
to
the
place
however
was
a
little
girl
a
grandchild
of
one
of
the
pensioners
admitted
by
special
favour
into
the
establishment
this
girl
had
and
her
case
was
a
severe
one
hope
was
admitted
with
unwillingness
even
to
her
and
was
obliged
to
assume
his
ultimate
degree
of
peremptoriness
of
manner
with
her
nurses
he
found
her
muffled
up
about
the
head
with
flannel
and
with
a
slice
of
fat
bacon
folded
in
flannel
tied
about
her
throat
a
means
considered
a
specific
for
in
some
regions
the
discarding
of
the
flannel
and
bacon
of
course
caused
great
offence
and
there
was
but
too
much
reason
to
fear
that
all
his
directions
as
to
the
management
of
the
girl
would
be
observed
by
contraries
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
he
had
long
ago
found
explanation
and
argument
to
be
useless
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
declare
authoritatively
that
if
his
directions
were
not
followed
the
girl
would
die
and
her
death
would
lie
at
the
door
of
her
nurses
that
in
that
case
he
expected
some
of
the
people
about
her
would
be
ill
after
her
but
that
if
he
was
obeyed
he
trusted
she
might
get
through
and
nobody
else
be
the
worse
almost
before
he
was
out
of
the
house
another
slice
of
fat
bacon
was
cut
and
the
flannels
put
to
the
fire
to
heat
again
hope
mounted
his
horse
to
depart
just
at
the
hour
when
the
labourers
were
at
their
dinners
in
all
the
cottages
around
they
poured
out
to
stare
at
him
some
shouting
that
they
should
not
have
him
long
to
look
at
as
they
would
get
a
better
doctor
soon
some
sent
their
dogs
yelping
at
his
horse
heels
and
others
vented
wrath
or
jokes
about
churchyards
soon
after
he
had
left
the
noise
behind
him
he
met
sir
william
hunter
riding
attended
by
his
groom
hope
stopped
him
making
it
his
apology
that
sir
william
might
aid
in
saving
the
life
of
a
patient
in
whom
he
was
much
interested
he
told
the
story
of
the
of
the
rural
method
of
treating
it
with
which
he
had
to
contend
and
proposed
that
sir
william
should
use
his
influence
in
securing
for
the
patient
a
fair
chance
of
her
life
sir
william
listened
coolly
would
certainly
call
at
the
almshouses
and
make
inquiry
but
did
not
like
to
interfere
with
the
notions
of
the
people
there
made
a
point
indeed
of
leaving
them
pretty
much
to
their
own
ways
owned
that
it
would
be
a
pity
the
girl
should
die
if
she
really
might
be
got
through
would
call
therefore
and
inquire
and
see
whether
lady
hunter
could
not
send
down
anything
from
the
hall
he
smiled
rather
incredulously
when
assured
that
it
was
not
anything
that
could
be
sent
down
from
the
hall
that
was
wanted
by
the
patient
but
only
the
use
of
the
fresh
air
that
was
about
her
and
the
observance
of
her
doctor
simple
directions
sir
william
next
began
to
make
his
horse
fidget
and
hope
took
the
hint
this
has
been
my
business
with
you
at
present
said
he
at
some
more
convenient
time
i
should
be
glad
of
a
little
conversation
with
you
on
other
matters
connected
with
these
almshouses
sir
william
hunter
bowed
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
off
as
if
life
or
death
depended
on
his
reaching
the
hall
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
these
hints
of
another
doctor
a
better
doctor
a
new
man
met
hope
in
other
directions
mrs
howell
was
once
quoted
as
a
whisperer
of
the
fact
and
the
milliner
young
lady
was
known
to
have
speculated
on
whether
the
new
doctor
would
prove
to
be
a
single
man
no
one
turned
away
from
such
gossip
with
more
indifference
than
hope
but
it
came
to
him
in
the
form
of
inquiries
which
he
was
supposed
best
able
to
answer
he
now
told
hester
of
them
all
warned
her
of
the
probable
advent
of
a
rival
practitioner
and
at
the
same
time
urged
upon
her
a
close
economy
in
the
management
of
the
house
as
his
funds
were
rapidly
failing
if
his
practice
continued
to
fall
off
as
it
was
now
doing
he
scarcely
saw
how
they
were
to
keep
up
their
present
mode
of
living
it
grieved
him
extremely
to
have
to
say
this
to
his
wife
in
the
very
first
year
of
their
marriage
he
had
hoped
to
have
put
larger
means
in
her
power
from
year
to
year
but
at
present
he
owned
his
way
was
far
from
being
clear
they
had
already
descended
to
having
no
prospect
at
all
for
all
this
hester
cared
little
she
had
never
known
the
pinchings
of
poverty
any
more
than
the
embarrassments
of
wealth
she
could
not
conceive
of
such
a
thing
as
being
very
anxious
about
what
they
should
eat
and
what
they
should
drink
and
wherewith
they
should
be
clothed
though
if
she
had
looked
more
narrowly
at
her
own
imaginations
of
poverty
she
would
perhaps
have
discovered
on
the
visionary
table
always
a
delicate
dish
for
her
husband
in
the
wardrobe
always
a
sleek
black
coat
and
in
his
a
clear
fire
in
winter
while
the
rest
of
the
picture
was
made
up
of
bread
and
vegetables
and
shabby
gowns
for
herself
and
devices
to
keep
herself
warm
without
burning
fuel
her
imagination
was
rather
amused
than
alarmed
with
anticipations
of
this
sort
of
poverty
it
was
certainly
not
poverty
that
she
dreaded
a
more
serious
question
was
how
she
could
bear
to
see
her
husband
supplanted
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
disgraced
this
question
the
husband
and
wife
now
often
asked
each
other
and
always
concluded
by
agreeing
that
time
must
show
the
girl
at
the
almshouses
died
in
a
fortnight
some
pains
were
taken
to
conceal
from
the
doctor
the
time
and
the
precise
spot
of
her
which
the
doctor
never
thought
of
inquiring
about
and
of
which
it
was
therefore
easy
to
keep
him
in
ignorance
a
few
of
the
neighbouring
cottagers
agreed
to
watch
the
grave
for
ten
nights
to
save
the
body
from
the
designs
of
evil
surgeons
one
of
the
watchers
reported
after
the
seventh
night
that
he
had
plainly
heard
a
horse
coming
along
the
road
and
that
he
rather
thought
it
stopped
opposite
the
churchyard
he
had
raised
himself
up
and
coughed
aloud
and
that
was
no
doubt
the
reason
why
nobody
came
the
horse
must
have
turned
back
and
gone
away
whoever
might
be
with
it
this
put
people
on
the
watch
and
on
the
eighth
night
two
men
walked
about
the
churchyard
they
had
to
tell
that
they
once
thought
they
had
caught
the
doctor
in
the
fact
they
had
both
heard
a
loud
whistle
and
had
stood
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
they
could
see
very
well
for
it
had
dawned
some
time
a
person
came
through
the
turnstile
with
a
sack
which
seemed
to
leave
his
intentions
in
no
doubt
they
hid
themselves
behind
two
opposite
trees
and
both
sprang
out
upon
him
at
once
but
it
was
only
the
miller
boy
on
his
way
to
the
mill
on
the
ninth
and
tenth
nights
nothing
happened
the
neighbours
began
to
feel
the
want
of
their
regular
sleep
and
the
querulous
grandmother
who
seemed
more
angry
that
they
meant
to
leave
the
poor
girl
body
to
itself
now
than
pleased
that
it
had
been
watched
at
all
was
compelled
to
put
up
with
assurances
that
doctors
were
considered
to
wish
to
cut
up
bodies
within
the
first
ten
days
if
at
all
and
were
not
apt
to
meddle
with
them
afterwards
it
was
full
three
weeks
from
this
time
when
hope
was
sent
for
to
the
almshouses
after
a
longer
interval
than
he
had
ever
known
to
elapse
without
the
old
folks
having
some
complaint
to
make
the
inmate
who
was
now
ill
was
the
least
aged
and
the
least
ignorant
and
unreasonable
person
in
the
establishment
he
was
grateful
to
hope
for
having
restored
him
from
a
former
illness
and
though
now
much
shaken
in
confidence
had
enough
remaining
to
desire
extremely
to
see
his
old
friend
when
he
found
himself
ill
and
in
pain
his
neighbours
wondered
at
him
for
wishing
to
court
destruction
by
putting
himself
again
into
the
hands
of
the
suspicious
doctor
but
he
said
he
could
have
no
ease
in
his
mind
and
was
sure
he
should
never
get
well
till
he
saw
the
gentleman
face
again
and
he
engaged
an
acquaintance
to
go
to
deerbrook
and
summon
him
this
acquaintance
spread
the
fact
of
his
errand
along
the
road
as
he
went
and
therefore
though
hope
took
care
to
choose
his
time
so
as
not
to
ride
past
the
while
the
labourers
were
at
dinner
his
visit
was
not
more
private
or
agreeable
than
on
the
preceding
occasion
the
first
symptom
of
his
being
expected
on
the
road
was
that
sir
william
hunter
riding
as
before
with
his
groom
behind
him
fell
in
with
hope
evidently
by
design
sir
william
hunter
visit
to
the
almshouses
had
produced
the
effect
of
making
him
acquainted
with
the
discontents
of
the
people
and
had
afforded
him
a
good
opportunity
of
listening
to
their
complaints
of
their
surgeon
without
being
troubled
with
the
answers
since
the
election
he
had
been
eager
to
hear
whatever
could
be
said
against
hope
whose
vote
given
contrary
to
sir
william
example
and
influence
was
regarded
by
the
baronet
as
an
unpardonable
impertinence
so
you
lost
your
patient
down
there
i
find
said
sir
william
rudely
the
girl
slipped
through
your
fingers
after
all
however
i
did
my
duty
by
you
i
told
the
people
they
ought
to
allow
you
a
fair
chance
i
requested
your
interference
on
the
girl
account
and
not
on
my
own
said
hope
but
as
you
allude
to
my
position
among
these
people
you
will
allow
me
to
ask
as
i
have
for
some
time
intended
whether
you
are
aware
of
the
treatment
to
which
i
am
subjected
in
your
neighbourhood
and
among
your
dependants
i
find
you
are
not
very
popular
hereabouts
indeed
sir
replied
the
baronet
with
a
which
was
immediately
reflected
in
the
face
of
the
groom
with
your
leave
we
will
have
our
conversation
to
ourselves
said
hope
the
baronet
directed
his
groom
to
ride
on
slowly
hope
continued
the
extreme
ignorance
of
the
country
people
has
caused
some
absurd
stories
against
me
to
be
circulated
and
believed
if
those
who
are
not
in
this
state
of
extreme
ignorance
will
do
me
justice
and
give
me
as
you
say
a
fair
chance
i
have
no
fear
but
that
i
shall
live
down
calumnies
and
by
perseverance
in
my
professional
duty
recover
the
station
i
lately
held
here
this
justice
this
fair
chance
i
claim
sir
william
from
all
who
have
the
intelligence
to
understand
the
case
and
rightly
observe
my
conduct
i
have
done
my
best
in
the
service
of
these
pensioners
of
yours
and
excuse
my
saying
that
i
must
be
protected
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
ay
there
the
thing
mr
hope
that
ca
be
done
you
see
if
the
people
do
not
like
you
why
then
the
only
thing
is
for
you
to
stay
away
then
what
is
to
become
of
the
sick
ay
there
the
thing
mr
hope
if
they
do
not
like
one
you
see
why
then
they
must
try
another
that
is
what
we
have
been
thinking
now
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
not
go
forward
you
will
repent
it
if
you
do
depend
upon
it
they
do
not
like
you
mr
hope
i
need
no
convincing
of
that
you
do
not
seem
disposed
to
stir
sir
william
to
improve
the
state
of
things
so
i
will
go
and
try
what
i
can
do
by
myself
i
advise
you
not
mr
hope
shouted
sir
william
as
hope
rode
rapidly
forward
take
care
what
you
are
about
they
do
not
want
to
see
you
again
the
consequences
may
be
serious
and
this
man
is
a
magistrate
and
he
fancies
himself
my
patron
thought
hope
as
he
rode
on
he
wants
me
to
throw
up
the
appointment
but
i
will
not
till
i
see
that
the
poor
old
creatures
can
be
consigned
to
care
as
good
as
my
own
if
he
chooses
to
dismiss
me
he
may
though
we
can
ill
afford
the
loss
just
now
for
one
moment
he
had
thought
of
turning
back
as
sir
william
caution
had
seemed
to
foretell
some
personal
risk
in
proceeding
but
the
remembrance
of
hester
parting
look
inspired
him
afresh
instead
of
the
querulous
anxiety
which
had
formerly
harassed
him
from
its
groundlessness
and
apparent
selfishness
it
was
now
an
anxiety
worthy
of
the
occasion
that
flushed
her
cheek
so
far
from
entreating
him
to
remain
with
her
she
had
bidden
him
go
where
his
duty
led
him
she
had
calculated
the
probable
length
of
his
absence
and
the
watch
was
laid
on
the
table
as
formerly
but
she
had
used
the
utmost
expedition
in
sewing
on
the
ring
of
his
umbrella
and
had
kissed
her
hand
to
him
from
the
window
with
a
smile
he
would
not
return
to
her
without
having
fully
discharged
his
errand
she
might
be
a
soldier
or
sailor
wife
after
all
thought
he
the
hours
of
his
absence
were
indeed
very
anxious
ones
to
the
family
at
home
for
nearly
two
hours
the
sisters
amused
themselves
and
one
another
as
well
as
they
could
but
it
was
a
great
relief
when
philip
came
in
he
would
not
believe
anything
they
said
however
about
their
reasons
for
fear
it
was
nonsense
it
was
deerbrook
talk
what
harm
could
a
dozen
old
men
and
women
at
almost
a
hundred
years
apiece
do
to
hope
and
the
country
people
the
labourers
round
they
had
their
own
business
to
attend
to
they
would
just
swear
an
oath
at
him
and
let
him
pass
and
if
they
ventured
to
lay
a
finger
on
his
bridle
hope
knew
how
to
use
his
whip
he
would
come
home
and
get
his
dinner
and
be
very
dull
they
would
see
from
having
nothing
to
before
philip
had
finished
his
picture
of
the
dull
dining
they
might
expect
morris
entered
and
shut
the
door
before
she
came
forward
to
the
table
and
spoke
she
said
she
did
not
like
to
make
mysteries
out
of
fear
of
frightening
people
and
she
hoped
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
really
afraid
of
now
but
if
mr
enderby
thought
he
could
contrive
to
meet
her
master
out
on
the
road
and
get
him
to
leave
his
horse
somewhere
and
come
walking
home
by
turnstile
lane
she
thought
it
would
be
best
and
save
some
bad
language
at
least
charles
had
brought
in
word
that
people
angry
people
were
gathering
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
and
her
master
could
quite
disappoint
them
by
coming
home
on
foot
the
back
how
many
angry
people
were
there
and
what
sort
of
people
they
were
mostly
countrymen
out
of
the
places
round
more
of
those
than
of
deerbrook
folks
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
so
many
as
nearly
to
block
up
the
street
at
one
part
if
the
ladies
would
step
up
into
the
boy
attic
they
would
see
something
of
what
was
going
on
from
the
little
window
there
without
being
seen
philip
snatched
his
hat
and
said
he
would
soon
bring
them
news
he
hoped
they
would
go
up
to
the
attic
and
amuse
themselves
with
the
show
for
a
mere
show
it
would
end
in
being
he
was
confident
he
observed
however
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
keep
charles
at
home
in
case
as
was
possible
of
a
messenger
being
wanted
he
himself
would
soon
be
back
charles
was
called
up
into
the
and
questioned
never
before
having
been
of
so
much
importance
he
was
very
grand
in
his
statements
and
made
the
most
of
all
he
had
to
say
still
however
it
was
a
story
which
no
telling
could
have
made
other
than
an
unpleasant
one
some
of
the
people
who
had
come
in
from
the
country
had
pitchforks
two
or
three
of
the
shopkeepers
had
put
up
their
shutters
many
strangers
were
in
the
churchyard
peeping
about
the
new
graves
and
others
had
set
scouts
on
the
road
to
give
notice
when
master
was
coming
mrs
plumstead
was
very
busy
scolding
the
people
all
round
but
it
did
not
do
any
good
for
they
only
laughed
at
her
you
may
go
charles
but
do
not
set
foot
out
of
the
house
till
you
are
bid
said
hester
when
she
found
the
boy
had
told
all
he
knew
and
perhaps
something
more
morris
left
the
room
with
him
in
order
to
keep
her
eye
upon
him
oh
margaret
this
is
very
terrible
said
hester
most
disagreeable
we
must
allow
something
for
charles
way
of
telling
the
story
but
yet
is
there
anything
we
can
do
hester
mr
grey
will
surely
be
here
presently
do
not
you
think
so
either
he
or
mr
rowland
no
doubt
dr
levitt
is
a
magistrate
but
this
is
saturday
and
he
is
so
deep
in
his
sermon
he
could
not
be
made
to
understand
and
believe
till
it
would
be
too
do
you
go
up
to
the
attic
margaret
and
i
will
keep
the
hall
door
i
shall
hear
his
horse
sooner
than
any
one
and
i
shall
stand
ready
to
open
to
him
in
an
instant
hark
now
it
was
only
the
boy
with
the
trotting
slowly
to
mrs
plumstead
amusing
himself
by
the
way
with
observations
on
the
unusual
animation
of
deerbrook
it
is
too
soon
yet
by
half
an
hour
said
margaret
he
can
not
possibly
be
here
for
this
i
think
do
not
wear
yourself
out
with
standing
in
the
hall
so
long
i
must
just
say
one
thing
love
i
fear
all
kinds
of
danger
less
for
edward
than
for
almost
any
one
else
in
the
world
he
does
always
what
is
most
simple
and
right
and
i
think
he
could
melt
anybody
heart
if
he
tried
thank
you
said
hester
gratefully
i
agree
and
trust
with
you
but
what
hearts
have
these
people
or
how
can
you
get
at
them
through
such
heads
but
yet
he
will
triumph
i
feel
when
margaret
went
to
the
attic
window
hester
moved
a
chair
into
the
hall
softly
opened
the
window
a
little
to
facilitate
her
hearing
whatever
passed
outside
and
took
her
seat
by
it
listening
intently
there
was
soon
but
too
much
to
listen
to
shuffling
feet
multiplied
about
the
door
and
some
of
the
grumbling
voices
seemed
to
come
from
men
who
had
stationed
themselves
on
the
steps
hester
rose
and
with
the
utmost
care
to
avoid
noise
put
up
the
chain
of
the
house
door
while
she
was
doing
this
morris
came
from
the
kitchen
for
the
same
purpose
she
feared
there
was
an
intention
to
surround
the
house
she
wished
her
master
would
keep
away
for
a
few
hours
at
least
she
could
not
think
where
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
place
were
that
they
did
not
come
and
see
after
her
young
ladies
before
the
words
were
uttered
there
was
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
morris
made
her
mistress
keep
back
while
she
found
out
who
it
was
before
letting
down
the
chain
hester
knew
it
was
not
her
husband
knock
and
it
turned
out
to
be
mr
grey
margaret
came
flying
down
and
they
all
exclaimed
how
glad
they
were
to
see
him
i
wish
i
could
do
you
any
good
said
he
but
this
is
really
a
sad
business
my
dears
have
you
heard
anything
sir
nothing
about
your
husband
enderby
bade
me
tell
you
that
he
is
gone
out
to
meet
him
and
to
stir
up
sir
william
hunter
who
may
be
said
to
be
the
cause
of
all
this
inasmuch
as
he
never
attempted
to
stop
the
discontent
when
he
might
but
that
unlucky
vote
my
dear
that
was
much
to
be
deplored
no
use
casting
that
up
now
surely
observed
morris
yes
morris
there
is
said
her
mistress
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
saying
that
i
glory
in
the
vote
and
i
would
have
my
husband
give
it
again
if
he
had
to
pass
through
yonder
crowd
to
go
up
to
the
poll
my
dear
remonstrated
mr
grey
be
prudent
do
not
urge
your
husband
on
into
danger
he
has
quite
enthusiasm
enough
without
and
you
see
what
comes
of
but
i
am
here
to
say
that
my
wife
hopes
you
and
margaret
will
retire
to
our
house
if
you
can
get
round
without
bringing
any
of
these
troublesome
people
with
you
we
think
you
might
slip
out
from
the
surgery
and
along
the
lane
and
through
the
rowlands
garden
door
and
over
the
hedge
which
they
tell
me
you
managed
to
climb
one
day
lately
for
pleasure
by
this
way
you
might
reach
our
house
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
on
no
account
whatever
said
hester
i
shall
not
leave
home
under
any
circumstances
you
are
very
kind
said
margaret
but
we
are
expecting
my
brother
every
moment
but
he
will
follow
you
by
the
same
road
both
wife
and
sister
were
sure
he
would
do
no
such
thing
they
thought
the
kindest
thing
mr
grey
could
do
would
be
to
go
out
the
back
way
and
see
that
the
constable
was
kept
up
to
his
duty
he
promised
to
do
so
and
that
he
would
speak
to
dr
levitt
to
have
some
of
grey
and
rowlands
men
sworn
in
as
special
constables
if
such
a
measure
should
appear
to
be
desirable
i
do
not
know
how
to
believe
all
this
now
said
margaret
it
seems
so
causeless
and
ridiculous
in
birmingham
we
could
never
have
given
credit
to
the
story
of
such
a
riot
about
nothing
morris
was
not
sure
of
this
in
large
towns
there
were
riots
sometimes
for
very
small
matters
or
on
account
of
entire
mistakes
she
had
always
heard
that
one
of
the
worst
things
about
living
in
a
village
is
that
when
the
people
once
get
a
wrong
idea
into
their
heads
there
is
no
getting
it
out
again
and
that
they
will
even
be
violent
upon
it
against
all
reason
but
such
things
she
knew
to
happen
occasionally
in
towns
another
knock
it
was
mr
rowland
and
hester
heart
turned
sick
at
there
being
no
news
of
her
husband
mr
rowland
had
every
expectation
of
course
that
mr
hope
would
be
quite
safe
and
that
this
would
turn
out
a
disturbance
of
very
slight
consequence
but
he
would
just
ask
whether
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
close
the
if
stones
should
find
their
way
into
the
parlours
it
might
be
disagreeable
to
the
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
would
not
closing
the
shutters
be
a
hint
to
the
people
outside
to
throw
stones
well
perhaps
so
he
only
thought
he
would
offer
the
suggestion
and
see
if
he
could
be
of
any
service
to
the
ladies
morris
go
up
to
the
attic
and
watch
and
margaret
do
you
stay
here
yes
mr
rowland
said
hester
fixing
her
glorious
eyes
full
on
him
you
can
be
of
service
to
us
if
my
husband
outlives
this
day
you
ought
to
pray
that
he
may
for
if
not
it
is
your
wife
who
has
murdered
him
mr
rowland
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
we
know
well
that
you
have
no
share
in
all
this
injury
we
believe
that
you
respect
my
husband
and
have
friendly
feelings
towards
us
all
i
will
spare
you
what
i
might
say
what
mrs
rowland
should
sink
to
the
earth
to
hear
if
she
were
standing
where
you
stand
i
look
upon
you
as
no
enemy
you
do
me
only
justice
said
mr
rowland
leaning
upon
the
chair
which
hester
had
brought
for
herself
i
wish
to
do
you
justice
and
therefore
i
warn
you
that
if
you
do
not
procure
complete
protection
for
my
husband
not
only
for
this
day
but
for
the
future
if
you
do
not
cause
your
wife
to
retract
her
slanders
stop
mrs
hope
this
is
going
too
far
said
mr
rowland
drawing
himself
up
and
putting
on
an
air
of
offended
dignity
it
is
not
going
too
far
you
can
not
you
dare
not
pretend
to
be
offended
with
what
i
say
when
you
know
that
my
noble
husband
has
been
injured
in
his
character
and
his
prospects
attacked
in
his
domestic
peace
and
now
exposed
to
peril
of
his
life
by
the
falsehoods
your
wife
has
told
i
tell
you
that
we
do
not
impute
her
crimes
to
you
if
this
is
justice
you
will
prove
it
by
doing
your
full
duty
to
my
husband
if
you
decline
any
part
of
this
duty
if
you
countenance
her
slanders
if
you
shrink
from
my
husband
side
in
whatever
we
may
have
to
go
through
if
you
do
not
either
compel
your
wife
to
do
us
right
or
do
it
yourself
in
opposition
to
her
you
are
her
partner
in
guilt
as
well
as
in
life
and
lot
consider
what
a
situation
you
place
me
in
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
would
have
you
see
that
every
false
charge
she
has
brought
is
retracted
every
vile
insinuation
recanted
you
must
make
her
say
everywhere
that
my
husband
has
not
stolen
dead
bodies
that
he
is
not
a
plotter
against
the
peace
and
order
of
society
that
he
has
not
poisoned
a
child
by
mistake
or
cut
off
a
sound
limb
for
the
sake
of
practice
and
amusement
your
wife
has
said
these
things
and
you
know
it
and
you
must
make
her
contradict
them
all
consider
what
a
situation
you
place
me
in
said
mr
rowland
again
be
generous
hester
said
margaret
do
not
trample
on
a
wretched
man
cried
mr
rowland
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
generous
exclaimed
hester
in
a
softened
tone
i
might
well
say
consider
what
a
situation
my
husband
is
placed
in
and
that
i
must
see
justice
done
to
him
before
i
can
be
generous
to
others
but
i
have
such
a
husband
that
i
can
afford
to
spare
the
wretched
and
be
generous
to
the
humbled
go
now
and
do
duty
by
us
and
the
next
time
you
hear
your
wife
say
that
we
do
not
love
and
are
not
happy
tell
her
that
if
we
forbear
to
crush
her
it
is
because
we
are
too
strong
for
her
too
strong
in
heart
however
weak
in
fortunes
because
we
are
strong
in
a
peace
which
she
can
not
poison
and
a
love
which
she
will
never
understand
even
at
a
moment
like
this
and
while
feeling
that
she
could
not
have
said
the
things
that
hester
said
margaret
eyes
swam
in
tears
of
joy
here
was
her
sister
in
a
moment
of
that
high
excitement
when
nothing
but
truth
ventures
upon
utterance
acknowledging
herself
blessed
in
peace
which
could
not
be
poisoned
and
love
which
the
vile
could
not
understand
the
day
whatever
might
be
its
events
was
worth
enduring
for
this
mr
rowland
walked
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
hall
wiped
his
brows
and
then
evidently
unable
to
endure
hester
presence
said
he
would
let
himself
out
and
there
await
mr
hope
arrival
or
anything
else
that
might
occur
oh
would
he
ever
come
it
seemed
to
hester
like
a
week
since
she
had
given
him
his
umbrella
and
seen
him
ride
away
hark
surely
this
must
be
it
certainly
was
his
horse
this
time
yes
there
was
morris
calling
from
the
stairs
that
her
master
was
fighting
his
way
down
the
street
there
was
charles
giving
notice
that
the
crowd
was
running
round
from
the
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
there
was
the
noise
among
the
people
outside
the
groaning
the
cries
now
said
morris
breathless
with
the
haste
she
had
made
down
stairs
morris
supposed
her
mistress
would
softly
let
down
the
chain
open
the
door
just
wide
enough
for
hope
to
slip
in
and
shut
bolt
and
chain
it
again
this
was
what
hester
had
intended
but
her
mood
was
changed
she
bade
the
servants
all
step
out
of
sight
and
then
threw
the
door
wide
open
going
forth
herself
upon
the
steps
the
people
had
closed
round
hope
horse
but
philip
was
pushing
his
in
between
the
mob
and
their
object
and
riding
round
and
round
him
with
a
sort
of
ludicrous
gravity
which
lowered
the
tone
of
the
whole
affair
to
margaret
mind
and
gave
her
great
relief
mr
rowland
was
shaking
hands
with
hope
with
one
hand
and
holding
the
bridle
of
the
uneasy
horse
with
the
other
hope
himself
was
bespattered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
and
his
umbrella
was
broken
to
pieces
he
nodded
cheerfully
to
hester
when
she
threw
open
the
door
when
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
smile
as
he
ascended
the
steps
the
noise
of
the
crowd
was
suddenly
hushed
they
understood
rather
more
of
what
they
saw
than
of
anything
that
could
be
said
to
them
they
allowed
charles
to
come
out
and
lead
the
horse
away
round
the
corner
to
the
stable
they
stood
gaping
and
staring
while
hope
invited
mr
rowland
in
and
mr
rowland
declined
entering
while
that
gentleman
shook
hands
with
the
ladies
spoke
with
mr
enderby
mounted
mr
enderby
horse
and
rode
off
they
saw
philip
turn
slowly
into
the
house
with
the
family
party
and
the
door
closed
before
they
thought
of
giving
another
groan
well
love
said
hester
looking
anxiously
at
her
husband
you
made
good
battle
said
philip
yes
i
had
a
pretty
hard
fight
of
it
from
the
hither
said
hope
stretching
vigorously
they
wrenched
my
whip
out
of
my
hand
five
hands
to
one
but
then
i
had
my
umbrella
i
broke
it
to
pieces
with
rapping
their
knuckles
which
are
as
hard
as
their
pates
observed
philip
what
are
we
to
do
next
if
they
do
not
disperse
presently
i
will
go
and
speak
to
them
but
i
dare
say
they
have
had
enough
of
the
show
for
mrs
plumstead
must
have
satisfied
them
with
oratory
that
poor
woman
face
and
voice
will
haunt
me
when
i
have
forgotten
all
the
rest
one
had
almost
rather
have
her
against
one
than
that
such
screaming
should
be
on
behalf
now
my
love
how
has
the
morning
gone
with
you
very
pleasantly
i
would
answer
for
it
from
her
looks
said
philip
and
hester
face
was
certainly
full
of
the
beauty
of
happiness
thank
god
the
morning
is
over
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
replied
she
surely
those
people
outside
are
growing
more
noisy
observed
margaret
i
must
change
my
clothes
in
case
of
its
being
necessary
to
speak
to
them
said
hope
i
look
too
like
a
victim
at
present
while
he
and
hester
were
out
of
the
room
philip
told
margaret
how
her
brother
had
been
treated
at
the
almshouses
he
had
narrowly
escaped
being
pulled
from
his
horse
and
thrown
into
the
pond
he
had
been
followed
to
deerbrook
by
a
crowd
throwing
stones
and
shrieking
and
just
when
he
had
got
beyond
their
reach
he
had
met
philip
and
learned
that
he
had
the
same
thing
to
go
through
at
the
other
extremity
of
his
journey
finding
that
both
his
doors
were
surrounded
he
had
judged
it
best
to
make
for
the
front
coming
home
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
usual
manner
he
had
kept
his
temper
admirably
joking
with
his
detainers
while
dealing
his
blows
upon
their
hands
where
will
all
this
end
cried
margaret
with
some
going
to
dinner
and
others
to
supper
i
imagine
replied
philip
stepping
to
the
window
from
what
i
see
that
seems
likely
to
be
the
upshot
for
here
is
sir
william
hunter
talking
to
the
people
i
had
rather
he
should
do
it
than
hope
and
margaret
i
had
rather
set
my
mischievous
sister
to
do
it
than
either
this
uproar
is
all
of
her
making
i
am
afraid
hester
has
been
telling
mr
rowland
so
this
morning
i
am
glad
of
it
he
must
help
me
to
work
upon
her
fears
if
there
is
nothing
better
left
to
operate
upon
you
will
not
succeed
said
margaret
your
sister
is
as
strong
a
heroine
in
one
direction
as
mine
is
in
another
she
shall
yield
however
she
may
be
thankful
that
she
is
not
here
if
she
was
i
would
have
her
out
upon
the
steps
and
make
her
retract
everything
and
if
she
should
not
be
able
to
speak
i
would
stand
by
her
and
say
it
for
her
oh
philip
what
a
horrible
idea
not
half
so
horrible
as
the
mischief
she
has
done
why
margaret
if
you
were
part
as
guilty
as
priscilla
is
i
should
require
you
to
make
reparation
indeed
i
hope
you
would
or
rather
that
but
do
not
let
us
conjure
up
such
dreadful
images
my
margaret
you
never
wronged
any
one
and
you
never
will
edward
never
did
i
am
sure
said
margaret
not
even
by
poisoning
children
nor
cutting
off
limbs
for
sport
are
you
quite
sure
love
what
is
sir
william
doing
here
with
only
his
groom
he
and
the
people
look
in
high
with
each
other
with
all
this
shaking
of
hands
and
nodding
and
laughing
i
can
not
conceive
what
he
can
be
saying
to
them
for
there
are
not
three
faces
among
the
whole
array
that
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
rational
creatures
never
mind
said
margaret
if
what
he
says
sends
them
away
i
care
for
nothing
else
about
it
oh
but
i
do
one
would
like
to
be
favoured
with
a
specimen
of
this
kind
of
rural
oratory
i
ought
to
benefit
by
all
the
oratory
that
comes
in
my
way
you
know
so
i
shall
just
open
the
window
an
inch
or
two
now
he
is
drawing
hitherward
and
take
a
lesson
it
seemed
as
if
sir
william
hunter
desired
that
his
powers
of
persuasion
should
be
expended
on
none
but
the
immediate
objects
of
them
for
whatever
he
said
was
spoken
as
he
bent
from
his
horse
and
with
the
air
of
a
mystery
many
a
plump
red
face
was
thrust
close
up
to
his
many
a
pair
of
round
staring
eyes
was
puckered
up
with
mirth
as
he
spoke
the
teamster
in
his
smock
the
hedger
in
his
and
the
little
bumpkins
who
had
snatched
a
holiday
from
scaring
the
crows
all
seemed
by
their
delight
to
be
capable
of
entering
into
the
baronet
method
of
argumentation
all
this
stimulated
curiosity
to
learn
what
the
speechifying
tended
to
he
could
catch
only
a
few
words
and
those
were
about
a
new
man
teach
him
to
take
himself
off
all
bad
things
come
to
an
end
new
state
of
things
soon
philip
was
afraid
there
was
treachery
here
margaret
had
no
other
expectation
from
the
man
the
tyrannical
politician
who
bore
a
grudge
against
a
neighbour
for
having
used
his
constitutional
liberty
according
to
his
conscience
some
spectacle
now
drew
the
attention
of
the
crowd
another
way
it
was
lady
hunter
in
her
chariot
and
greys
statelily
pacing
through
the
village
she
had
heard
that
there
was
some
commotion
in
deerbrook
and
as
sights
are
rare
in
the
country
she
thought
she
would
venture
to
come
to
the
village
to
shop
rather
than
wait
for
sir
william
account
of
the
affair
in
the
evening
over
their
wine
and
oranges
and
before
he
dropped
off
into
his
nap
she
rightly
confided
in
the
people
that
they
would
respect
her
chariot
and
greys
and
allow
her
to
pass
amidst
them
in
safety
and
honour
she
had
never
seen
a
person
mobbed
here
was
a
good
opportunity
it
was
even
possible
that
she
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
ladies
in
their
terrors
at
all
events
she
should
be
a
great
person
and
see
and
hear
a
great
deal
so
she
would
go
orders
were
given
that
she
should
be
driven
quickly
up
to
the
milestone
beyond
the
and
then
very
slowly
through
deerbrook
to
mrs
howell
her
servants
were
prompt
for
they
too
longed
to
see
what
was
going
forward
and
thus
they
arrived
finding
a
nice
little
mob
to
their
expectations
and
no
cause
of
regret
but
that
they
arrived
too
late
to
see
mr
hope
get
home
there
were
no
ladies
in
terror
within
sight
but
then
there
was
the
affecting
spectacle
of
sir
popularity
in
full
view
of
all
the
mob
lady
hunter
put
a
corner
of
her
embroidered
handkerchief
to
each
eye
on
witnessing
the
affection
of
his
neighbours
to
her
husband
shown
by
the
final
shaking
of
hands
which
was
now
gone
through
sir
william
then
rode
slowly
up
to
the
followed
by
his
groom
who
touched
his
hat
orders
were
given
to
drive
on
and
then
lady
hunter
servants
touched
their
hats
the
carriage
resumed
its
slow
motion
and
sir
william
rode
beside
it
his
hand
on
the
door
and
his
countenance
solemn
as
if
he
was
on
the
bench
instead
of
on
horseback
the
great
blessing
of
the
arrangement
was
that
everybody
followed
lady
hunter
having
come
to
see
the
mob
the
mob
now
in
return
went
to
see
lady
hunter
and
while
they
were
cherishing
their
mutual
interest
the
family
in
the
were
left
in
peace
to
prosecute
their
dinners
philip
threw
up
the
window
which
looked
into
the
garden
and
then
ran
down
to
bring
margaret
some
flowers
to
refresh
her
senses
after
the
hurry
of
the
morning
margaret
let
down
the
chain
of
the
hall
door
and
morris
laid
the
cloth
as
she
had
sent
charles
to
sweep
down
the
steps
and
pavement
before
the
house
that
all
things
might
wear
as
much
as
possible
their
usual
appearance
hester
ordered
up
a
bottle
of
her
husband
best
ale
and
the
servants
went
about
with
something
of
the
air
peculiar
to
a
day
of
frolic
dear
heart
lady
hunter
can
it
be
your
ladyship
exclaimed
mrs
howell
venturing
to
show
her
face
at
the
door
of
her
darkened
shop
and
to
make
free
entrance
for
her
most
exalted
customer
good
heavens
your
ladyship
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
your
ladyship
here
on
such
a
day
cried
miss
miskin
where
bob
miss
miskin
do
miss
miskin
send
bob
to
take
down
the
shutters
that
is
if
your
ladyship
thinks
that
sir
william
would
recommend
it
if
sir
william
thinks
it
safe
that
is
my
criterion
i
hope
we
are
all
safe
now
mrs
howell
replied
the
lady
sir
william
popularity
is
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
for
us
all
and
for
the
place
at
large
oh
dear
your
ladyship
what
should
we
be
not
to
estimate
sir
william
we
have
our
faults
like
other
people
but
really
if
we
did
not
know
how
to
value
sir
william
thank
heaven
said
miss
miskin
we
have
not
fallen
so
low
as
that
now
your
ladyship
can
see
a
little
of
our
goings
on
now
the
shutters
are
down
but
dear
heart
your
ladyship
would
not
have
wondered
at
our
putting
them
up
i
am
sure
i
thought
for
my
part
that
that
middle
shutter
never
would
have
gone
up
it
stuck
your
ladyship
oh
cried
mrs
howell
putting
her
hands
before
her
face
as
if
the
recollection
was
even
now
too
much
for
her
the
middle
shutter
stuck
bob
had
got
it
awry
and
jammed
it
between
the
other
two
and
there
nothing
that
bob
could
do
would
move
it
and
there
we
heard
the
noise
at
a
distance
the
cries
your
ladyship
and
the
shutter
would
not
go
up
and
miss
miskin
ran
out
and
so
did
i
did
you
really
well
i
must
say
i
admire
your
courage
mrs
howell
oh
your
ladyship
in
a
moment
of
desperation
you
know
if
anybody
had
seen
miss
miskin
face
i
sure
as
she
tugged
at
the
shutter
it
was
as
red
really
scarlet
and
i
sure
so
was
yours
mrs
howell
downright
crimson
and
after
all
resumed
mrs
howell
we
should
never
have
got
the
shutter
up
if
mr
tucker
had
not
had
the
politeness
to
come
and
help
us
but
we
are
talking
all
this
time
and
perhaps
your
ladyship
may
be
almost
fainting
with
the
fright
would
not
your
ladyship
step
into
my
parlour
and
have
a
little
drop
of
something
let
me
have
the
honour
a
glass
of
mulled
port
wine
or
a
drop
of
miss
miskin
you
will
oblige
us
the
you
know
miss
miskin
received
the
keys
from
the
girdle
with
a
smile
of
readiness
but
lady
hunter
declined
refreshment
she
explained
that
she
felt
more
collected
than
she
might
otherwise
have
done
from
her
not
having
been
taken
by
surprise
she
had
been
partly
aware
before
she
left
the
hall
of
what
she
should
have
to
encounter
dear
heart
what
courage
goodness
how
brave
i
could
not
be
satisfied
to
remain
safe
at
the
hall
you
know
when
i
did
not
know
what
might
be
happening
to
sir
william
so
i
ordered
the
carriage
and
came
it
was
a
very
anxious
ride
i
assure
you
mrs
howell
but
i
found
when
i
got
here
that
i
need
not
have
been
under
any
alarm
for
sir
william
he
has
made
himself
so
beloved
that
i
believe
we
have
nothing
to
fear
for
him
under
any
circumstances
but
what
can
we
think
mrs
howell
of
those
who
try
to
create
such
danger
what
indeed
any
one
i
sure
who
would
so
much
as
dream
of
hurting
a
hair
of
sir
william
head
as
i
said
to
miss
miskin
when
mr
tucker
told
us
sir
william
was
come
among
them
the
criterion
said
i
as
it
happens
sir
william
is
in
no
danger
i
believe
but
no
thanks
to
those
who
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
disturbance
it
is
no
merit
of
theirs
that
sir
william
is
so
popular
no
indeed
your
ladyship
we
may
thank
heaven
for
that
not
them
but
what
to
be
done
your
ladyship
i
declare
it
is
not
safe
to
go
on
in
this
way
it
makes
one
think
of
being
burnt
in
one
bed
and
all
the
three
shuddered
sir
william
will
take
the
right
measures
you
need
not
doubt
mrs
howell
sir
william
looks
forward
sir
william
is
very
cautious
though
from
his
intrepidity
some
might
doubt
it
the
safety
of
deerbrook
may
very
well
be
left
to
sir
william
no
doubt
your
ladyship
no
doubt
we
should
be
really
afraid
to
go
to
our
beds
if
we
had
not
sir
william
to
rely
on
as
miss
miskin
said
to
me
only
this
morning
but
dear
heart
what
can
sir
william
or
an
angel
from
heaven
do
in
some
sorts
of
dangers
if
one
might
ask
for
one
confidential
satisfaction
what
does
sir
william
think
of
this
affair
of
the
amidst
shrugs
and
sighs
miss
miskin
drew
quite
near
to
hear
the
fate
of
deerbrook
revealed
by
lady
hunter
but
lady
hunter
did
not
know
the
facts
about
the
on
which
the
inquiry
was
based
this
only
showed
how
secret
some
people
could
be
in
their
designs
there
was
no
saying
what
lady
hunter
might
think
of
it
it
really
seemed
as
if
deerbrook
that
had
had
such
a
good
character
hitherto
was
going
to
be
on
a
level
with
popish
places
a
place
of
devastation
and
conflagration
lady
hunter
looked
excessively
grave
when
she
heard
this
and
if
possible
graver
than
ever
when
she
was
told
that
not
only
had
a
lantern
been
found
in
the
churchyard
with
a
bit
of
candle
left
in
the
socket
but
that
a
piece
of
charred
stick
full
three
inches
long
had
been
picked
up
close
by
the
after
hearing
this
lady
hunter
would
not
commit
herself
any
further
she
asked
for
some
with
a
dignified
and
melancholy
air
while
she
was
selecting
the
article
she
let
mrs
howell
talk
on
about
the
lantern
and
the
stick
that
no
one
wondered
about
the
lantern
knowing
what
practices
went
on
in
the
churchyard
when
quiet
people
were
asleep
but
that
the
charred
stick
was
too
alarming
only
that
to
be
sure
anybody
might
be
aware
that
those
who
would
go
into
churchyards
for
one
bad
purpose
would
be
ready
enough
for
another
and
that
heaven
only
knew
how
long
the
churches
of
the
land
would
be
safe
while
lowrys
were
sent
to
parliament
and
those
that
sent
them
there
were
all
abroad
lady
hunter
sighed
emphatically
whispered
her
desire
that
the
should
be
set
down
in
her
account
and
went
away
amidst
deep
and
mournful
curtseys
from
those
whom
she
left
behind
under
certain
circumstances
the
mind
becomes
so
rapidly
possessed
of
an
idea
is
enabled
to
assimilate
it
so
completely
and
speedily
that
the
possessor
becomes
unaware
how
very
recently
the
notion
was
received
and
deals
with
it
as
an
thought
this
must
be
lady
excuse
for
no
other
can
be
found
for
speaking
of
the
plot
for
burning
deerbrook
church
as
one
of
the
signs
of
the
times
which
had
alarmed
sir
william
and
herself
of
late
she
had
so
digested
mrs
howell
fact
by
the
time
she
had
reached
mr
tucker
shop
that
she
thus
represented
the
case
of
the
charred
stick
to
mr
tucker
without
any
immediate
sting
of
conscience
for
telling
a
lie
she
felt
rather
uncomfortable
when
mr
jones
the
butcher
who
had
stepped
in
at
tucker
to
discuss
the
event
of
the
morning
observed
with
deference
but
with
much
decision
that
he
was
sorry
to
hear
sir
william
was
made
uneasy
by
the
circumstance
of
the
charred
stick
having
been
found
as
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
simple
matter
to
account
for
several
of
the
boys
of
the
village
his
own
son
john
for
one
had
lately
taken
to
the
old
sport
of
whirling
round
a
lighted
stick
at
the
end
of
a
string
to
make
a
circle
of
fire
in
the
dark
sometimes
it
happened
that
a
spark
caught
the
string
and
then
the
stick
was
apt
to
fly
off
nobody
knew
where
it
was
an
unsafe
sport
certainly
and
as
such
he
had
forbidden
it
to
his
son
john
but
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
without
defending
the
sport
that
the
stick
in
question
had
jerked
itself
over
the
churchyard
wall
and
had
not
been
put
there
by
anybody
to
say
nothing
of
its
having
lain
so
far
from
the
door
and
in
the
grass
too
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
what
could
be
expected
to
catch
fire
from
it
jones
took
up
his
hat
from
the
counter
saying
that
as
sir
william
was
close
at
hand
he
would
step
and
tell
him
what
he
thought
would
ease
his
mind
about
this
affair
this
movement
laid
open
to
lady
hunter
mind
the
enormity
of
her
fib
and
remembering
that
as
far
as
she
knew
her
husband
had
never
heard
of
the
charred
stick
she
vigorously
interfered
to
keep
mr
jones
where
he
was
averring
that
sir
william
had
rather
hear
the
explanation
from
her
than
from
any
person
actually
resident
in
deerbrook
he
had
his
reasons
and
she
must
insist
mr
jones
bowed
her
alarm
ceased
and
her
compunction
gradually
died
away
when
mr
tucker
had
received
his
orders
about
the
which
occasioned
his
whispering
that
there
had
never
been
so
much
need
in
deerbrook
of
guards
against
fire
as
now
lady
hunter
footman
came
into
the
shop
to
say
that
his
master
was
in
the
carriage
sir
william
had
sent
his
horse
home
and
would
return
in
the
chariot
with
his
lady
she
hastened
away
to
prevent
any
chat
between
sir
william
and
mr
jones
but
once
in
the
carriage
in
all
the
glory
of
being
surrounded
and
watched
by
a
number
of
gaping
clowns
and
shouting
boys
she
could
not
resolve
to
bury
herself
in
the
seclusion
of
the
hall
without
enjoying
the
bustle
a
little
longer
she
therefore
suddenly
discovered
that
she
wanted
to
order
a
morning
cap
at
miss
nares
and
the
carriage
drew
up
in
state
before
the
milliner
door
miss
flint
whose
hair
had
come
out
of
curl
from
her
having
leaned
out
of
an
upper
window
to
watch
the
commotion
now
flew
to
the
glass
to
pull
off
her
miss
nares
herself
hastily
drew
out
of
drawers
and
cupboards
the
smart
things
which
had
been
huddled
away
under
the
alarm
about
the
sacking
of
deerbrook
and
then
threw
a
silk
handkerchief
over
the
tray
on
which
stood
the
elder
wine
and
toast
with
which
she
and
her
assistant
had
been
comforting
themselves
after
the
panic
of
the
morning
all
the
caps
were
tried
on
with
mysterious
melancholy
but
with
some
haste
sir
william
must
not
be
kept
long
waiting
in
times
like
these
a
moments
were
valuable
sir
william
was
reading
the
newspaper
in
order
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
considered
the
affair
of
this
morning
a
trifling
one
but
these
are
strange
times
miss
nares
very
alarming
my
lady
i
am
sure
i
do
know
when
we
shall
recover
from
the
fright
and
no
further
back
than
six
weeks
i
had
that
person
in
my
lady
to
attend
miss
flint
in
a
sore
throat
so
little
were
we
aware
i
am
thankful
enough
it
was
not
for
a
broken
arm
observed
miss
flint
in
accents
of
devout
gratitude
yes
indeed
my
dear
observed
miss
nares
it
would
have
ruined
all
your
prospects
in
life
if
he
had
done
by
you
as
he
did
by
the
russell
taylors
nursemaid
have
you
never
heard
that
my
lady
well
i
am
astonished
i
find
the
story
is
in
everybody
mouth
mrs
russell
taylor
nursemaid
was
crossing
the
court
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
when
she
tripped
over
the
string
of
master
hampden
taylor
kite
well
my
lady
she
fell
and
her
first
thought
you
know
was
to
save
the
baby
so
she
let
all
her
weight
go
on
the
other
arm
the
right
and
as
you
may
suppose
broke
it
it
snapped
below
the
elbow
the
gentleman
in
the
was
sent
for
immediately
to
set
it
now
they
say
you
my
lady
know
all
about
it
of
course
that
there
are
two
bones
in
that
part
of
one
arm
below
the
elbow
there
are
so
quite
correct
there
are
two
bones
well
my
lady
all
the
story
depends
upon
that
the
gentleman
in
question
did
set
the
bones
but
he
set
them
across
you
see
as
it
might
be
so
and
miss
nares
arranged
four
pieces
of
whalebone
on
the
table
in
the
shape
of
a
long
narrow
letter
x
there
could
not
have
been
a
better
exemplification
the
consequence
was
my
lady
that
the
poor
girl
hand
was
found
when
she
had
got
well
to
be
turned
completely
round
and
in
fact
it
is
all
but
useless
when
her
hands
are
in
her
lap
observed
miss
flint
the
palm
of
the
right
lies
uppermost
ugh
when
she
beckons
the
children
with
that
hand
observed
miss
nares
they
think
she
means
them
to
go
further
off
a
girl
who
has
to
earn
her
bread
my
lady
it
is
in
everybody
mouth
i
assure
you
what
has
become
of
the
girl
asked
lady
hunter
oh
she
was
got
rid
of
sent
away
to
save
the
credit
of
the
gentleman
in
the
but
these
things
will
come
out
my
lady
you
are
aware
that
the
russell
taylors
have
for
some
time
been
employing
mr
foster
from
blickley
ah
true
i
had
heard
of
that
with
unrelaxed
gravity
lady
hunter
returned
to
her
equipage
carrying
with
her
miss
nares
newest
cap
and
story
as
the
carriage
drew
near
the
the
driver
as
if
sympathising
with
his
lady
thoughts
made
his
horses
go
their
very
slowest
lady
hunter
raised
herself
and
leaned
forward
that
she
might
see
what
she
could
see
in
this
dangerous
abode
the
spring
evening
sunshine
was
streaming
in
at
the
garden
window
at
the
back
of
the
house
so
that
the
party
in
the
room
was
perfectly
visible
in
the
thorough
light
to
any
one
who
could
surmount
the
obstacle
of
the
blind
lady
hunter
saw
four
people
sitting
at
dinner
and
somebody
was
waiting
on
them
she
could
scarcely
have
told
what
it
was
that
surprised
her
but
she
exclaimed
to
sir
william
good
heavens
they
are
at
dinner
sir
william
called
out
angrily
to
the
coachman
to
drive
faster
and
asked
whether
he
meant
to
keep
everybody
out
till
midnight
the
hopes
were
far
less
moved
by
seeing
the
baronet
and
his
lady
driving
by
than
the
baronet
and
his
lady
were
by
seeing
the
hopes
dining
they
had
not
the
slightest
objection
to
the
great
folks
from
the
hall
deriving
all
the
excitement
and
amusement
they
could
from
an
airing
through
the
village
and
they
were
happily
ignorant
of
the
most
atrocious
stories
about
hope
which
were
now
circulating
from
mouth
to
mouth
all
round
deerbrook
it
was
not
long
however
before
they
found
that
they
had
been
indebted
to
the
great
folks
from
the
hall
for
a
certain
degree
of
protection
partly
from
the
equipage
having
drawn
off
the
attention
of
some
of
the
idlers
and
partly
from
the
people
having
been
unwilling
to
indulge
all
their
anger
and
impertinence
in
the
presence
of
a
magistrate
scarcely
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
after
the
sound
of
the
carriage
wheels
had
died
away
before
a
face
was
seen
surmounting
the
blind
of
the
windows
towards
the
street
presently
another
appeared
and
another
men
below
were
hoisting
up
boys
to
make
grimaces
at
the
family
and
see
what
was
going
on
the
shutters
were
closed
rather
earlier
than
usual
philip
went
out
to
make
a
survey
he
and
mr
grey
soon
returned
to
advise
that
the
ladies
should
quit
the
house
and
that
a
guard
should
enter
it
the
first
proposition
was
refused
the
second
accepted
mr
grey
carried
off
all
the
money
and
small
valuables
hester
and
margaret
bestirred
themselves
to
provide
refreshments
for
grey
and
rowland
men
who
were
to
be
ready
to
act
in
their
defence
they
scarcely
knew
what
to
expect
but
they
resolved
to
remain
where
edward
was
and
to
fear
nothing
from
which
he
did
not
shrink
there
was
much
noise
round
the
house
a
multitude
of
feet
and
of
voices
messengers
were
sent
off
to
the
hall
and
to
dr
levitt
who
must
now
be
disturbed
whatever
might
become
of
his
sermon
philip
brought
in
mr
rowland
men
and
declared
he
should
not
leave
the
premises
again
if
the
ladies
would
not
be
persuaded
to
go
he
took
up
his
station
in
the
hall
whence
he
thought
he
could
learn
most
of
what
it
was
that
the
people
had
intended
to
do
and
be
most
ready
to
act
as
occasion
might
require
no
one
could
imagine
what
was
designed
or
whether
there
was
any
design
at
all
on
foot
the
only
fact
at
present
apparent
was
that
the
crowd
was
every
moment
increasing
hester
was
stooping
over
the
cellaret
in
the
room
where
they
had
dined
when
a
tremendous
crash
startled
her
and
a
stone
struck
down
the
light
which
stood
beside
her
leaving
her
in
total
darkness
philip
came
to
her
in
a
moment
no
one
had
thought
of
closing
the
shutters
of
the
back
windows
and
now
the
garden
was
full
of
people
the
house
was
besieged
back
and
front
and
in
ten
minutes
from
the
entrance
of
this
first
stone
not
a
pane
of
glass
was
left
unbroken
in
any
of
the
lower
windows
hope
ran
out
his
spirit
thoroughly
roused
by
these
insults
and
he
was
the
first
to
seize
and
detain
one
of
the
offenders
but
the
feat
was
rather
too
dangerous
to
bear
repetition
he
was
recognised
surrounded
and
had
some
heavy
blows
inflicted
upon
him
he
succeeded
in
bringing
off
his
man
but
it
was
by
the
help
of
a
sally
of
his
friends
from
the
house
and
having
locked
up
his
prisoner
in
his
he
found
it
best
to
await
the
arrival
of
a
magistrate
before
he
went
forth
again
the
surgery
was
the
most
open
to
attack
and
this
being
the
place
where
the
people
expected
to
find
the
greatest
number
of
dead
bodies
their
energies
were
directed
towards
the
professional
part
of
the
premises
the
pupil
took
flight
and
left
the
intruders
to
work
their
pleasure
they
found
no
bodies
and
were
angry
accordingly
when
the
crashing
of
all
the
glass
was
over
the
shelves
and
cases
were
torn
down
and
with
the
table
and
chairs
carried
out
into
the
street
and
cast
into
a
heap
other
wood
was
brought
and
it
was
owing
to
the
pertinacity
of
the
mob
in
front
of
the
house
in
attacking
the
shutters
that
the
rioters
met
with
no
opposition
in
the
surgery
hope
enderby
and
their
assistants
had
more
on
their
hands
than
they
could
well
manage
in
beating
off
the
assailants
in
front
if
the
shutters
were
destroyed
the
whole
furniture
of
the
house
would
go
and
no
protection
would
remain
to
anybody
in
it
the
surgery
must
be
left
to
take
its
chance
rather
than
this
barrier
between
the
women
and
the
mob
be
thrown
down
whatever
offensive
warfare
was
offered
from
the
house
was
from
the
servants
from
the
upper
window
the
women
poured
down
a
quick
succession
of
pails
of
water
and
charles
returned
with
good
aim
such
stones
as
had
found
their
way
in
the
gentlemen
were
little
aware
for
some
time
that
the
cries
of
vexation
or
ridicule
which
were
uttered
now
and
then
were
caused
by
the
feats
of
their
own
coadjutors
overhead
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
seeing
hester
and
margaret
laughing
in
the
midst
of
their
panic
that
the
fact
became
known
to
them
soon
after
a
bright
light
was
visible
between
the
crevices
of
the
shutters
and
a
prodigious
shout
arose
outside
the
bonfire
was
kindled
hester
and
margaret
went
to
the
upper
windows
to
see
it
and
when
the
attacks
upon
the
shutters
seemed
to
have
ceased
enderby
joined
them
there
were
very
few
faces
among
the
crowd
that
were
known
even
to
charles
whose
business
it
was
in
his
own
opinion
to
know
everybody
mr
tucker
was
evidently
only
looking
on
from
a
distance
mrs
plumstead
had
been
on
the
spot
but
was
gone
terrified
into
quietness
by
the
fire
into
which
the
rioters
had
threatened
to
throw
her
if
she
disturbed
their
proceedings
she
had
professed
to
despise
the
idea
of
a
ducking
in
the
brook
but
a
scorching
in
the
fire
was
not
to
be
braved
so
no
more
was
heard
of
her
this
night
three
or
four
of
the
frequenters
of
the
were
on
the
spot
but
though
they
lent
a
hand
to
throw
fresh
loads
of
fuel
on
the
fire
they
did
not
take
their
pipes
from
their
mouths
nor
seem
to
be
prime
movers
in
the
riot
the
yellow
blaze
lighted
up
a
hundred
faces
scowling
with
anger
or
grinning
with
mirth
but
they
were
all
strange
strange
as
the
incidents
of
the
day
a
little
retired
from
the
glare
of
the
fire
was
a
figure
revealed
only
when
the
flame
shot
up
from
being
freshly
fed
sir
william
hunter
on
horseback
with
his
immovable
groom
behind
him
how
long
he
had
been
there
nobody
in
the
house
could
tell
nor
whether
he
had
attempted
to
do
anything
in
behalf
of
peace
and
quiet
there
he
sat
as
if
looking
on
for
his
amusement
and
forgetting
that
he
had
any
business
with
the
scene
it
was
no
wonder
that
dr
levitt
was
not
yet
visible
if
he
should
arrive
by
dawn
that
was
all
that
could
be
expected
but
where
were
mr
grey
and
sydney
where
was
mr
rowland
like
some
of
mr
hope
other
neighbours
who
ought
to
have
come
to
his
aid
on
such
an
occasion
these
gentlemen
were
detained
at
home
by
the
emotions
of
their
families
sydney
grey
was
locked
up
by
his
tender
mother
as
securely
as
mr
prisoner
and
all
the
boy
efforts
to
break
the
door
availed
only
to
bruise
him
full
as
seriously
as
the
mob
would
have
done
his
father
was
detained
by
the
tremors
of
his
wife
the
palpitations
of
sophia
and
the
tears
and
sobs
of
the
twins
all
of
which
began
with
the
certainty
of
the
first
stone
having
been
thrown
and
were
by
no
means
abated
by
the
sight
of
the
reflection
of
the
flames
on
the
sky
mr
grey
found
it
really
impossible
to
leave
his
family
as
he
afterwards
said
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
by
sending
his
men
these
things
were
exactly
what
his
partner
said
he
too
had
done
the
best
he
could
in
sending
his
men
he
too
found
it
impossible
to
leave
his
family
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
when
the
first
stones
had
begun
to
fly
the
carriage
which
was
heard
in
the
intervals
of
the
crashes
to
roll
by
contained
mrs
rowland
and
her
children
and
some
one
else
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
it
was
made
impossible
to
mr
rowland
to
leave
his
family
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
people
in
the
a
fresh
shout
soon
announced
some
new
device
a
kind
of
procession
appeared
to
be
advancing
up
the
street
and
some
notes
of
rude
music
were
heard
a
party
was
bringing
an
effigy
of
mr
hope
to
burn
on
the
pile
there
was
the
odious
thing
plain
enough
in
the
light
of
the
fire
with
the
halter
round
its
neck
a
knife
in
the
right
hand
and
a
phial
a
real
phial
out
of
hope
own
surgery
in
the
left
this
is
too
bad
to
be
borne
cried
enderby
while
hope
who
had
come
up
to
see
what
others
were
seeing
laughed
heartily
at
the
representative
of
himself
this
is
not
to
be
endured
morris
quick
fetch
me
half
a
dozen
candles
candles
sir
yes
candles
i
will
put
this
rabble
to
flight
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
it
before
oh
philip
said
margaret
apprehensively
fear
nothing
margaret
i
am
going
to
do
something
most
eminently
safe
as
you
will
see
he
would
not
let
any
one
go
with
him
but
charles
and
morris
it
was
some
minutes
before
any
effect
from
his
absence
was
perceived
but
at
length
just
when
the
effigy
had
been
sufficiently
insulted
and
was
about
to
be
cast
into
the
flames
and
hester
had
begged
her
husband
not
to
laugh
at
it
any
more
a
roar
of
anguish
and
terror
was
heard
from
the
crowd
which
began
to
disperse
in
all
directions
the
ladies
ventured
to
lean
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
uproar
they
understood
it
in
a
moment
mr
enderby
had
possessed
himself
of
the
skeleton
which
hung
in
the
mahogany
case
in
the
had
lighted
it
up
behind
the
eyes
and
the
ribs
and
was
carrying
it
aloft
before
him
approaching
round
the
corner
and
thus
confronting
the
effigy
the
spectre
moved
steadily
on
while
the
people
fled
it
made
straight
for
sir
william
hunter
who
now
seemed
for
the
first
time
disposed
to
shift
his
place
he
did
so
with
as
much
slowness
and
dignity
as
were
compatible
with
the
urgency
of
the
circumstances
edging
his
horse
further
and
further
into
the
shade
when
he
found
however
that
the
spectre
continued
to
light
its
own
path
towards
him
there
was
something
rather
piteous
in
the
tone
of
his
appeal
i
am
sir
william
hunter
i
am
i
am
sir
william
hunter
the
spectre
disregarding
even
this
information
there
was
nothing
for
the
baronet
to
do
but
to
gallop
off
his
groom
for
once
in
advance
of
him
when
they
were
out
of
sight
the
spectre
turned
sharp
round
and
encountered
dr
levitt
who
was
now
arriving
just
when
every
one
else
was
departing
he
started
as
might
have
been
expected
spoke
angrily
to
the
idle
boy
whom
he
supposed
to
be
behind
the
case
of
bones
and
laughed
heartily
when
he
learned
who
was
the
perpetrator
and
what
the
purpose
of
the
joke
he
entered
hope
house
to
learn
the
particulars
of
the
outrage
and
order
off
the
prisoner
into
confinement
elsewhere
his
ideas
being
too
extensively
discomposed
to
admit
of
any
more
this
night
charles
had
already
captured
the
effigy
and
set
it
up
in
the
hall
a
few
more
pailsful
of
water
extinguished
the
fire
in
the
street
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
neighbourhood
seemed
to
be
as
quiet
as
usual
where
are
you
to
sleep
after
all
this
fatigue
said
hope
to
his
wife
and
sister
when
dr
levitt
and
philip
were
gone
and
the
men
were
at
their
supper
below
i
do
not
believe
they
have
left
you
a
room
which
is
not
open
to
the
night
air
what
a
strange
home
to
have
put
you
in
who
would
have
thought
it
a
year
ago
hester
smiled
and
said
she
was
never
less
sleepy
morris
believed
that
not
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
in
the
attics
and
her
ladies
could
sleep
there
if
they
preferred
remaining
at
home
to
stepping
to
mr
grey
they
much
preferred
remaining
where
they
were
and
on
examination
it
was
found
that
margaret
room
was
also
entire
hope
proposed
to
take
possession
of
charles
attic
for
once
and
charles
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
having
a
mattress
laid
down
for
him
in
a
corner
of
the
upper
landing
morris
tempted
the
ladies
and
her
master
to
refresh
themselves
with
tea
she
piled
up
the
fire
to
a
christmas
height
to
compensate
for
the
draughts
which
blew
in
from
the
broken
windows
hope
soon
grew
discontented
with
her
plan
this
will
never
do
said
he
shivering
you
will
all
be
ill
and
nobody
must
be
ill
now
for
i
have
no
medicines
left
morris
murmured
a
wish
that
the
physic
had
been
forced
down
the
throats
it
is
better
where
it
is
morris
said
her
master
and
we
will
forgive
these
poor
people
shall
we
not
they
are
lamentably
ignorant
you
see
morris
thought
forgiveness
was
always
pretty
sure
to
come
in
time
but
it
was
not
very
easy
at
the
moment
she
thought
she
could
get
over
their
robbing
her
master
of
any
amount
of
property
but
she
could
not
excuse
their
making
him
ridiculous
before
his
lady
own
eyes
they
can
not
make
him
ridiculous
morris
said
hester
cheerfully
people
who
are
persecuted
are
considered
great
you
know
morris
said
margaret
bravo
ladies
cried
hope
you
keep
up
your
own
spirits
and
my
complacency
bravely
but
seriously
morris
he
continued
perceiving
that
the
vulgarity
of
the
present
affliction
weighed
down
the
good
woman
heart
is
it
not
true
that
few
of
our
trials
none
of
those
which
are
most
truly
trials
seem
dignified
at
the
time
if
they
did
patience
would
be
easier
than
it
is
the
death
of
martyrs
to
their
faith
is
grand
to
look
back
upon
but
it
did
not
appear
so
to
the
best
of
the
martyrs
at
the
time
this
little
trial
of
ours
looks
provoking
and
foolish
and
mean
to
us
but
whether
it
really
is
so
will
depend
on
how
we
bear
it
and
whatever
it
may
bring
after
it
grand
or
mean
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
be
with
it
morris
morris
curtsied
low
and
now
to
your
rooms
resumed
hope
this
place
is
growing
too
chilly
for
you
notwithstanding
morris
capital
fire
one
thing
more
said
margaret
i
am
a
little
uneasy
about
maria
has
any
one
thought
of
her
she
must
be
anxious
about
us
i
will
go
this
moment
said
hope
nay
my
love
it
is
early
yet
no
one
in
deerbrook
is
gone
to
rest
yet
but
the
children
i
can
be
back
in
ten
minutes
and
the
street
is
empty
let
him
go
said
margaret
it
will
be
a
great
kindness
and
surely
there
is
no
danger
now
hope
was
gone
he
did
not
come
back
in
ten
minutes
nor
in
half
an
hour
even
margaret
heartily
repented
having
urged
him
to
leave
home
during
his
absence
she
thus
repented
but
no
longer
when
he
returned
he
brought
news
which
made
her
hasten
to
dress
herself
for
the
open
air
when
she
was
quite
ready
to
retire
to
rest
it
was
well
that
her
brother
had
gone
maria
had
been
thrown
down
by
the
crowd
which
had
overtaken
her
as
she
was
walking
homewards
and
she
had
broken
her
leg
the
limb
was
set
the
case
was
a
simple
and
promising
one
but
she
was
in
pain
and
margaret
must
go
and
pass
the
night
with
her
how
thankful
were
they
all
now
that
some
one
had
thought
of
maria
she
had
been
in
extreme
anxiety
for
them
and
she
would
not
certainly
have
sent
for
aid
before
the
morning
it
was
indeed
a
blessing
that
some
one
had
thought
of
maria
chapter
twenty
nine
coming
to
an
understanding
mr
enderby
was
too
angry
with
his
sister
to
see
her
that
night
he
went
straight
to
his
room
at
his
mother
old
house
and
did
not
breakfast
with
the
rowlands
he
knocked
at
their
door
when
breakfast
was
finished
and
sent
to
request
mrs
rowland
presence
in
the
all
this
had
given
the
lady
time
to
prepare
her
mood
and
some
very
clever
and
bold
sayings
but
when
the
interview
was
over
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
some
of
these
sayings
had
gone
out
of
her
mind
and
how
others
had
remained
there
for
want
of
opportunity
to
speak
them
so
that
she
had
not
made
nearly
so
good
a
figure
as
she
had
intended
there
was
all
due
politeness
in
enderby
way
of
inducing
his
sister
to
sit
down
and
of
asking
after
the
health
of
herself
and
her
children
we
are
all
wonderfully
improved
thank
you
brother
indeed
i
have
hopes
that
we
shall
all
enjoy
better
health
henceforward
than
we
have
ever
known
mr
walcot
care
will
be
new
life
to
us
whose
care
mr
walcot
we
brought
him
with
us
last
night
and
he
is
to
go
at
once
into
my
mother
house
he
is
a
surgeon
of
the
first
degree
of
eminence
i
think
myself
extremely
fortunate
in
having
secured
him
the
chief
reason
however
of
my
inviting
him
here
was
that
my
poor
mother
might
be
properly
taken
care
of
now
i
shall
be
at
peace
on
her
account
which
i
really
never
was
before
now
that
she
will
be
in
good
hands
i
shall
feel
that
i
have
done
my
duty
and
pray
does
rowland
know
of
your
having
brought
this
stranger
here
of
course
mr
walcot
is
our
guest
till
his
own
house
can
be
prepared
for
him
as
i
tell
you
he
arrived
with
me
last
night
and
now
let
me
tell
you
sister
that
either
mr
walcot
is
not
a
man
of
honour
or
you
have
misinformed
him
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
here
i
suspect
the
latter
to
be
the
case
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
whole
of
your
conduct
towards
mr
hope
conduct
unpardonable
for
its
untruthfulness
and
hateful
for
its
malice
not
one
of
mrs
rowland
prepared
answers
would
suit
in
this
place
before
she
could
think
of
anything
to
say
enderby
proceeded
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
for
a
brother
to
have
to
speak
to
a
sister
as
i
now
speak
to
you
but
it
is
your
own
doing
mr
hope
must
have
justice
and
you
have
no
one
to
blame
but
yourself
that
justice
must
be
done
at
your
expense
i
give
you
fair
notice
that
i
shall
discharge
my
duty
fully
in
the
painful
circumstances
in
which
you
have
contrived
to
place
all
your
family
do
what
you
will
philip
my
first
duty
is
to
take
care
of
the
health
of
my
parent
and
my
children
and
if
by
the
same
means
deerbrook
is
provided
with
a
medical
man
worthy
of
its
confidence
all
deerbrook
will
thank
me
ignorant
and
stupid
as
deerbrook
is
about
many
things
priscilla
it
is
not
so
wicked
as
to
thank
any
one
for
waging
a
cowardly
war
against
the
good
for
disparaging
the
able
and
accomplished
and
fabricating
and
circulating
injurious
stories
against
people
too
magnanimous
for
the
slanderer
to
understand
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
philip
i
mean
that
you
have
done
all
this
towards
the
hopes
you
do
not
know
that
he
and
his
wife
are
not
happy
you
know
that
hope
is
an
able
and
most
humane
man
in
his
profession
and
that
he
does
not
steal
dead
bodies
you
know
the
falsehood
of
the
whole
set
of
vulgar
stories
that
you
have
put
into
circulation
against
him
you
know
also
that
my
mother
has
entire
confidence
in
him
and
that
it
will
go
near
to
break
her
heart
to
have
him
dismissed
for
any
one
else
this
is
the
meaning
of
what
i
say
as
for
what
i
mean
to
do
it
is
this
i
shall
speak
to
mr
walcot
at
once
before
his
intention
to
settle
here
is
known
you
are
too
late
my
dear
sir
every
one
in
deerbrook
knows
it
as
well
as
if
dr
levitt
was
to
give
notice
of
it
from
the
pulpit
so
much
the
worse
for
you
priscilla
i
shall
explain
the
whole
of
hope
case
to
mr
walcot
avoiding
if
possible
all
exposure
of
you
oh
pray
do
not
disturb
yourself
about
that
mr
walcot
knows
me
very
well
i
am
not
afraid
avoiding
if
possible
all
exposure
of
you
resumed
enderby
but
not
shrinking
from
the
full
statement
of
the
facts
if
that
should
prove
necessary
to
hope
justification
if
this
gentleman
be
honourable
he
will
decline
attending
my
mother
and
go
away
more
willingly
than
he
came
i
shall
bear
testimony
to
my
friend
with
equal
freedom
everywhere
else
and
i
will
never
rest
till
the
wrongs
you
have
done
him
are
repaired
as
far
as
reparation
is
possible
you
take
the
tone
of
defiance
i
see
philip
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
we
defy
each
other
then
i
can
not
but
take
that
tone
for
a
purpose
which
i
conceive
is
the
kindest
which
under
the
circumstances
can
be
entertained
towards
you
sister
i
do
it
in
the
hope
that
before
it
is
too
late
you
will
yourself
do
the
justice
which
i
vow
shall
be
done
i
give
you
peremptory
warning
leaving
you
opportunity
to
retrieve
yourself
to
repair
the
mischief
you
have
done
and
to
alleviate
the
misery
which
i
see
is
coming
upon
you
you
are
very
good
but
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
i
shall
proceed
in
my
own
way
i
mean
to
get
rid
of
these
hopes
and
perhaps
you
may
be
surprised
to
see
how
soon
i
succeed
the
hopes
shall
remain
as
long
as
they
wish
to
stay
if
truth
can
prevail
against
falsehood
i
am
sorry
for
you
if
you
can
not
endure
the
presence
of
neighbours
whose
whole
minds
and
conduct
are
noble
and
humane
and
known
by
you
to
be
so
this
desire
to
get
rid
of
them
is
a
bad
symptom
priscilla
a
symptom
of
a
malady
which
neither
hope
nor
mr
walcot
nor
any
one
but
yourself
can
cure
i
would
have
you
look
to
it
is
your
sermon
ended
it
is
time
i
was
getting
ready
to
hear
dr
levitt
what
i
have
to
say
is
not
finished
i
desire
to
know
what
you
mean
by
telling
everybody
that
i
am
engaged
to
miss
mary
bruce
i
said
so
because
it
is
true
the
cool
assurance
with
which
she
said
this
was
too
much
for
gravity
he
burst
out
if
not
precisely
true
when
i
said
it
it
was
sure
to
be
so
soon
which
is
just
the
same
thing
i
mean
that
it
shall
be
true
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
your
marrying
and
upon
your
marrying
mary
bruce
i
know
she
would
like
it
and
stop
there
not
another
word
about
miss
bruce
i
will
not
have
you
take
liberties
with
her
name
to
me
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
told
you
so
it
is
not
true
that
she
would
like
it
no
more
true
than
many
other
things
that
you
have
said
and
if
you
were
to
repeat
it
till
night
it
would
make
no
sort
of
impression
upon
me
miss
bruce
knows
little
and
cares
less
about
me
and
beware
how
you
say
to
the
contrary
and
now
for
the
plain
fact
i
am
engaged
elsewhere
no
you
are
not
yes
i
am
you
will
marry
no
one
but
mary
bruce
at
last
you
will
see
whatever
you
may
think
now
for
heaven
sake
priscilla
if
you
have
any
of
the
regard
you
profess
to
have
for
miss
bruce
treat
her
name
with
some
respect
i
am
accepted
by
margaret
ibbotson
i
dare
say
you
are
margaret
ibbotson
so
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
your
energy
about
the
hopes
i
admired
hope
before
i
ever
saw
margaret
with
sufficient
energy
to
prompt
me
to
anything
i
mean
to
do
in
his
support
but
margaret
has
certainly
exalted
my
feelings
towards
him
as
she
has
towards
everything
morally
great
and
beautiful
i
hope
you
will
all
make
yourselves
happy
with
your
greatness
and
your
beauty
for
these
friends
of
yours
seem
likely
to
have
little
else
left
to
comfort
themselves
with
they
will
be
happy
with
their
greatness
and
loveliness
sister
for
it
is
heaven
decree
that
they
should
why
will
you
not
let
yourself
be
happy
in
witnessing
it
priscilla
why
will
you
not
throw
off
the
restraint
of
bad
feelings
and
do
magnanimous
justice
to
this
family
and
having
thus
opened
and
freed
your
mind
glory
in
their
goodness
the
next
best
thing
to
being
as
good
as
they
you
have
power
of
mind
to
do
this
the
very
force
with
which
you
persist
in
persecuting
them
shows
that
you
have
power
for
better
things
believe
me
they
are
full
of
the
spirit
of
forgiveness
do
but
try
thank
you
i
am
glad
you
are
aware
of
my
power
if
they
forgive
me
for
anything
it
shall
be
for
my
power
that
is
not
for
you
to
determine
happily
to
what
extent
they
forgive
is
between
god
and
themselves
you
lie
under
their
forgiveness
whether
you
will
or
not
i
own
priscilla
i
would
fain
bestow
on
margaret
a
sister
whom
she
might
respect
rather
than
forgive
pray
how
many
persons
have
you
persuaded
that
margaret
ibbotson
is
to
be
my
very
few
for
your
sake
scarcely
any
we
have
been
willing
to
allow
you
your
own
time
and
methods
for
extricating
yourself
from
the
difficulties
you
have
made
for
yourself
by
your
inconsiderate
talk
about
miss
bruce
i
own
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
could
originate
and
carry
on
such
a
device
you
must
now
get
out
of
the
scrape
in
your
own
way
i
am
glad
you
have
told
so
few
people
of
your
entanglement
it
makes
it
an
easier
matter
to
help
you
i
shall
deny
the
engagement
everywhere
that
will
hardly
avail
against
my
testimony
it
will
when
you
are
gone
the
deerbrook
people
always
attend
to
the
last
speaker
indeed
i
think
i
have
the
majority
with
me
now
as
the
events
of
last
night
pretty
plainly
show
hope
is
not
the
first
good
man
who
has
been
slandered
and
suffered
violence
oh
priscilla
i
am
unwilling
to
give
you
up
let
me
hope
that
the
pride
the
insane
pride
of
this
morning
is
but
the
reaction
of
your
internal
suffering
from
witnessing
the
results
of
your
influence
in
the
outrages
of
last
night
confide
this
to
me
now
and
give
yourself
such
ease
as
you
yet
can
thank
you
but
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
was
extremely
glad
to
arrive
when
i
did
it
satisfied
me
as
to
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
these
people
and
it
proved
to
mr
walcot
as
i
observed
to
him
at
the
time
how
much
he
was
wanted
here
now
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
i
must
go
i
shall
deny
your
engagement
everywhere
philip
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
with
an
earnestness
from
which
for
one
moment
she
shrank
but
she
instantly
rallied
and
returned
him
a
stare
which
lasted
till
she
reached
the
door
there
is
something
almost
sublime
in
audacity
like
this
thought
he
but
it
can
not
last
it
comes
from
internal
torture
a
thing
as
necessarily
temporary
as
faith
the
source
of
the
other
kind
of
strength
is
durable
not
the
slightest
compunction
has
she
for
having
caused
the
misery
she
knows
of
and
not
a
whit
would
she
relent
if
she
could
become
aware
which
she
never
shall
of
what
she
made
margaret
suffer
i
fear
my
margaret
has
still
much
to
endure
from
her
i
will
watch
and
struggle
to
ward
off
from
her
every
evil
word
and
thought
this
is
the
only
comfort
under
the
misery
of
her
being
exposed
to
the
malice
of
any
one
belonging
to
me
no
not
the
only
comfort
she
does
not
suffer
from
these
things
as
she
did
she
says
she
has
a
new
strength
and
thank
god
i
believe
it
now
for
mr
walcot
i
must
catch
him
as
he
comes
out
of
church
and
see
what
i
can
make
of
him
if
he
is
an
honourable
man
all
may
turn
out
well
if
not
rowland
and
i
must
see
what
can
be
done
next
chapter
thirty
condolence
the
family
in
the
thought
this
the
strangest
sunday
morning
they
had
ever
looked
upon
outside
their
premises
all
was
like
a
may
sabbath
the
gardens
sent
up
their
fragrance
into
the
warm
still
air
the
cottage
windows
were
open
and
early
roses
and
late
hyacinths
appeared
within
the
casements
the
swallows
were
skimming
and
dipping
about
the
meadows
and
the
swans
steered
their
majestic
course
along
the
river
rippling
its
otherwise
unbroken
surface
the
men
of
the
village
sat
on
the
thresholds
of
their
doors
smoking
an
early
pipe
and
their
tidy
children
the
boys
with
hair
combed
straight
and
the
girls
with
clean
pinafores
came
abroad
some
to
carry
the
sunday
dinner
to
the
baker
and
others
to
nurse
the
baby
in
the
sunshine
or
to
snatch
a
bit
of
play
behind
a
neighbour
dwelling
the
contrast
within
the
was
strange
morris
and
the
boy
had
been
up
early
to
gather
the
stones
and
sweep
up
the
fragments
of
glass
from
the
floors
to
put
the
effigy
out
of
sight
and
efface
the
marks
of
feet
in
the
hall
and
parlours
the
supper
had
been
cleared
away
in
the
kitchen
and
the
smell
of
spirits
and
tobacco
got
rid
of
but
this
was
all
that
the
most
zealous
servants
could
do
the
front
shutters
must
remain
closed
and
the
garden
windows
empty
of
glass
the
garden
itself
was
a
mournful
spectacle
the
pretty
garden
which
had
been
the
pride
and
pleasure
of
the
family
all
this
spring
part
of
the
wall
was
thrown
down
the
ivy
trailed
on
the
earth
of
the
shrubs
some
were
pulled
up
and
others
cut
off
at
the
roots
the
beds
were
trodden
into
clay
and
the
grass
so
green
and
sunny
yesterday
was
now
trampled
black
where
it
was
not
hidden
with
fragments
of
the
of
the
surgery
and
with
the
refuse
of
the
broken
glasses
and
spilled
drugs
hope
had
also
risen
early
he
had
found
his
scared
pupil
returned
and
wandering
about
the
ruins
of
his
abode
the
surgery
they
set
to
work
together
to
put
out
of
sight
whatever
was
least
seemly
of
the
scattered
contents
of
the
professional
apartment
but
with
all
their
pains
the
garden
looked
forlorn
and
disagreeable
enough
when
hester
came
down
shawled
to
make
breakfast
in
the
open
air
of
the
parlour
and
her
husband
thought
it
time
to
go
and
see
how
maria
had
passed
the
night
and
to
bring
margaret
home
hester
received
from
her
husband
and
sister
a
favourable
report
of
maria
she
had
slept
and
margaret
had
slept
beside
her
maria
carried
her
philosophy
into
all
the
circumstances
of
her
lot
and
she
had
been
long
used
to
pain
and
interruption
of
her
plans
these
things
and
the
hurry
of
an
accident
in
the
street
might
dismay
one
inexperienced
in
suffering
but
not
her
when
not
kept
awake
by
actual
pain
she
slept
and
when
assured
that
her
case
was
perfectly
simple
and
that
there
was
every
probability
of
her
being
as
well
as
usual
in
a
few
weeks
all
her
anxieties
were
for
the
hopes
no
report
of
them
could
have
satisfied
her
so
well
as
mr
hope
early
visit
as
his
serene
countenance
and
cheerful
voice
she
saw
that
he
was
not
sad
at
heart
and
warmly
as
she
honoured
his
temper
she
could
hardly
understand
this
no
wonder
for
she
did
not
know
what
his
sufferings
had
previously
been
from
other
causes
nor
how
vivid
was
his
delight
at
the
spirit
in
which
hester
received
their
present
misfortunes
margaret
saw
at
once
that
all
was
well
at
home
and
made
no
inquiries
about
her
sister
here
is
a
letter
for
you
with
a
magnificent
seal
said
hester
as
they
entered
and
here
is
tea
as
hot
i
believe
as
if
we
were
still
blessed
with
glass
windows
the
letter
had
just
been
left
by
sir
william
hunter
groom
it
was
from
the
baronet
and
its
contents
informed
mr
hope
that
his
attendance
would
not
be
required
at
the
almshouses
in
future
as
their
inmates
were
placed
under
the
medical
superintendence
of
mr
walcot
i
am
glad
said
hester
no
more
danger
and
insult
from
that
quarter
nor
funds
either
my
dear
it
is
pleasant
enough
to
have
no
insult
and
danger
to
apprehend
but
what
will
you
say
to
having
no
funds
we
shall
see
when
that
time
comes
love
meantime
here
is
breakfast
and
the
sweet
sunday
all
before
us
the
pressure
of
her
hand
by
her
husband
effaced
all
woes
present
and
future
who
is
mr
walcot
asked
margaret
somebody
from
blickley
i
suppose
said
hester
no
replied
hope
mr
walcot
is
a
surgeon
last
from
cheltenham
who
settled
in
deerbrook
at
seven
yesterday
evening
and
who
has
already
swept
the
greater
part
of
the
practice
of
the
place
i
suspect
he
is
no
doubt
the
doctor
new
man
of
whom
we
have
heard
so
much
of
late
hester
changed
colour
and
margaret
too
while
hope
related
the
arrival
of
mrs
rowland
and
her
party
as
he
had
heard
it
from
his
pupil
early
this
what
sort
of
man
was
mr
walcot
time
must
show
his
coming
to
settle
in
this
manner
at
such
a
conjuncture
of
circumstances
did
not
look
very
well
hope
said
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
he
must
necessarily
be
extremely
prejudiced
against
the
family
in
the
if
his
information
about
deerbrook
was
derived
from
mrs
rowland
he
ought
not
to
be
judged
till
he
had
had
time
and
opportunity
to
learn
for
himself
what
was
the
real
state
of
affairs
in
the
place
he
must
have
fair
play
and
it
was
very
possible
that
he
might
turn
out
a
man
who
would
give
others
fair
play
at
the
next
knock
hester
started
thereby
showing
that
she
was
moved
mr
jones
had
called
to
know
how
the
family
were
and
after
satisfying
himself
on
this
point
had
left
a
delicate
sweetbread
with
his
respects
and
wishes
that
mrs
hope
might
relish
it
after
her
fright
this
incident
gave
the
little
family
more
pleasure
than
mr
walcot
had
yet
caused
them
pain
here
was
sympathy
the
most
acceptable
offering
they
could
receive
next
came
a
message
of
inquiry
from
dr
and
mrs
levitt
with
an
intimation
that
they
would
call
if
not
inconvenient
to
the
family
after
church
this
was
pleasant
too
while
it
was
being
agreed
that
a
nurse
must
be
found
immediately
for
maria
and
that
the
glazier
at
blickley
must
have
notice
to
send
people
to
mend
the
windows
as
early
as
possible
morning
a
letter
was
brought
in
which
looked
longer
but
less
grand
than
sir
william
hunter
it
was
from
mr
rowland
private
my
dear
sir
morning
during
the
greater
part
of
an
anxious
night
my
mind
was
full
of
the
intention
of
calling
on
you
this
morning
for
some
conversation
on
a
topic
which
must
be
discussed
between
us
but
the
more
i
dwell
upon
what
must
be
said
the
more
i
shrink
from
an
interview
which
can
not
but
be
extremely
painful
to
each
party
and
i
have
at
length
come
to
the
conclusion
that
for
both
our
sakes
it
is
best
to
write
what
i
have
to
say
it
is
painful
enough
god
knows
to
write
it
your
position
here
my
dear
sir
must
have
been
anything
but
pleasant
for
some
time
past
i
regret
that
its
uneasiness
should
have
been
augmented
as
i
fear
it
has
by
the
influence
of
any
one
connected
with
myself
my
respect
for
you
has
been
as
undeviating
as
it
is
sincere
and
i
have
not
to
reproach
myself
with
having
uttered
a
word
concerning
you
or
your
family
which
i
should
be
unwilling
to
repeat
to
yourselves
but
i
am
aware
that
the
same
can
not
be
said
with
regard
to
every
one
for
whom
i
am
in
a
manner
answerable
in
relation
to
this
unpleasant
fact
i
can
only
say
that
i
entreat
you
to
accept
the
assurance
of
my
deep
regret
and
mortification
a
new
aspect
of
affairs
has
presented
itself
to
me
very
suddenly
as
i
trust
you
will
believe
on
my
word
of
honour
a
gentleman
of
your
profession
named
walcot
arrived
last
night
with
a
view
to
settling
in
deerbrook
the
first
inducement
held
out
to
him
was
the
medical
charge
of
mrs
enderby
and
of
the
whole
of
my
family
but
of
course
it
is
not
probable
that
his
expectations
of
practice
among
your
patients
stop
here
and
the
present
unfortunate
state
of
the
public
mind
of
deerbrook
regarding
yourself
makes
it
too
probable
that
his
most
sanguine
expectations
will
be
realised
i
write
this
with
extreme
pain
but
i
owe
it
to
you
not
to
disguise
the
truth
however
distasteful
may
be
its
nature
these
being
the
circumstances
of
the
case
it
appears
to
me
hopeless
to
press
the
departure
of
mr
walcot
and
if
he
went
away
i
should
fear
that
some
one
would
arrive
to
occupy
his
position
yet
my
dear
sir
justice
must
be
done
to
you
after
protracted
and
anxious
consideration
one
mode
of
action
has
occurred
to
me
by
which
atonement
may
be
made
to
you
for
what
has
passed
let
me
recommend
it
to
your
earnest
and
favourable
consideration
some
other
place
of
residence
would
i
should
hope
yield
you
and
your
family
the
consideration
and
comfort
of
which
you
have
here
been
most
unjustly
deprived
elsewhere
you
might
ensure
the
due
reward
of
that
professional
ability
and
humanity
which
we
have
shown
ourselves
unworthy
to
appreciate
if
you
could
reconcile
yourself
to
removing
with
your
family
i
believe
that
the
peace
of
our
society
would
be
promoted
that
unpleasant
collisions
of
opinions
and
interests
would
be
avoided
and
that
that
reparation
would
be
made
to
you
which
i
fear
would
be
impracticable
here
all
difficulty
about
the
process
of
removal
might
and
should
be
obviated
to
speak
frankly
i
should
in
that
case
consider
myself
your
debtor
to
such
an
amount
as
by
a
comparison
of
your
losses
and
my
means
should
appear
to
us
both
to
be
just
i
believe
i
might
venture
to
make
myself
answerable
for
so
much
as
would
settle
you
in
some
more
favourable
locality
and
enable
you
to
wait
a
moderate
time
for
that
appreciation
of
your
professional
merits
which
would
be
certain
to
ensue
i
need
not
add
that
in
case
of
your
acceding
to
my
proposition
all
idea
of
would
be
misplaced
i
offer
no
more
than
i
consider
actually
your
due
the
circumstance
of
the
father
of
a
large
and
rising
family
offering
to
become
responsible
to
such
an
extent
indicates
that
my
sense
of
your
claim
upon
me
is
very
strong
i
should
be
glad
to
be
relieved
from
it
and
i
therefore
once
more
beseech
your
best
attention
to
my
proposal
latter
particulars
of
which
have
been
confided
to
no
person
nor
shall
they
be
under
any
circumstances
unless
you
desire
it
i
shall
await
your
reply
with
anxiety
yet
with
patience
as
i
am
aware
that
such
a
step
as
i
propose
can
not
be
decided
on
without
some
reflection
i
rejoice
to
find
that
your
family
have
not
suffered
materially
from
the
outrages
of
last
night
it
was
matter
of
sincere
regret
to
me
that
the
unexpected
arrival
of
my
family
at
the
very
time
prevented
my
hastening
to
offer
my
best
services
to
you
and
yours
the
magistracy
will
of
course
repair
all
damages
and
then
i
trust
no
evil
consequences
will
survive
i
beg
my
best
compliments
to
mrs
hope
and
miss
ibbotson
and
entreat
you
to
believe
me
my
dear
sir
with
the
highest
respect
your
obedient
servant
h
rowland
for
one
moment
hester
looked
up
in
her
husband
face
as
he
read
this
letter
in
a
subdued
voice
for
one
moment
she
hoped
he
would
make
haste
to
live
elsewhere
in
some
place
where
he
would
again
be
honoured
as
he
once
was
here
and
where
all
might
be
bright
and
promising
as
ever
but
that
moment
gaze
at
her
husband
changed
her
thoughts
and
wishes
her
colour
rose
with
the
same
feelings
which
drew
a
deep
seriousness
over
his
countenance
mr
rowland
means
well
said
margaret
but
surely
this
will
never
do
i
hardly
know
what
you
would
consider
meaning
well
replied
hope
rowland
would
buy
himself
out
of
an
affair
which
he
has
not
the
courage
to
manage
by
nobler
means
he
would
give
for
the
concealment
of
his
wife
offences
he
would
bribe
me
from
the
assertion
of
my
own
character
and
would
for
his
private
ends
stop
the
working
out
of
the
question
between
deerbrook
and
me
this
is
to
my
mind
the
real
aspect
of
his
proposal
however
persuaded
he
himself
may
be
that
he
intends
peace
to
his
neighbours
and
justice
to
me
this
letter
he
continued
waving
it
before
him
is
worthy
only
of
the
fire
where
i
would
put
it
this
moment
but
that
i
suppose
prudence
requires
that
we
should
retain
in
our
own
hands
all
evidence
whatever
relating
to
the
present
state
of
our
affairs
i
do
not
exactly
see
what
is
to
become
of
us
said
hester
cheerfully
nor
do
i
love
but
is
not
all
the
world
in
the
same
condition
how
much
does
the
millionaire
know
of
what
is
to
intervene
between
and
his
death
and
the
labouring
classes
observed
margaret
that
prodigious
multitude
of
toiling
thinking
loving
trusting
beings
how
many
of
them
see
further
than
the
week
which
is
coming
round
and
who
spends
life
to
more
purpose
than
some
of
them
they
toil
they
think
they
love
they
obey
they
trust
and
who
will
say
that
the
most
secure
in
worldly
fortune
are
making
a
better
start
for
eternity
than
they
they
see
duty
around
them
and
god
above
them
and
what
more
need
they
see
you
are
right
said
hester
what
i
said
was
cowardly
i
wish
i
had
your
faith
you
have
it
said
her
husband
there
was
faith
in
your
voice
and
nothing
faithless
in
what
you
said
it
is
a
simple
truth
that
we
can
not
see
our
way
before
us
we
must
be
satisfied
to
discern
the
duty
of
the
day
and
for
the
future
to
do
what
we
ought
always
to
be
doing
walk
by
faith
and
not
by
sight
now
as
to
this
present
duty
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
it
is
my
duty
to
offer
moral
resistance
to
oppression
and
to
make
a
stand
for
my
reputation
when
it
pleases
god
that
men
should
be
overwhelmed
by
calumny
it
is
a
dreadful
evil
which
must
be
borne
as
well
as
it
may
but
not
without
a
struggle
we
must
not
too
hastily
conclude
that
this
is
to
be
the
issue
in
our
case
we
must
stay
and
struggle
for
right
and
justice
struggle
for
it
by
living
on
with
firm
patient
and
gentle
minds
this
is
surely
what
we
ought
to
do
rather
than
go
away
for
the
sake
of
ease
leaving
the
prejudices
of
our
neighbours
in
all
their
virulence
because
we
have
not
strength
to
combat
them
and
letting
the
right
succumb
to
the
wrong
for
want
of
faith
and
constancy
to
vindicate
it
oh
we
will
stay
cried
hester
i
will
try
to
bear
everything
and
be
thankful
to
have
to
bear
for
such
reasons
it
is
all
easy
love
when
you
lay
open
your
views
of
our
life
when
you
give
us
your
insight
into
the
providence
of
it
i
believe
i
should
have
looked
at
it
in
this
way
before
if
you
had
been
suffering
in
any
great
cause
any
cause
manifestly
great
because
the
welfare
of
many
others
was
involved
in
it
i
see
now
that
the
principle
of
endurance
and
the
duty
of
steadfastness
are
the
same
though
and
yet
she
paused
and
bit
her
lip
though
the
occasion
looks
insignificant
enough
said
her
husband
true
some
might
laugh
at
our
having
to
appeal
to
our
faith
because
we
have
been
mobbed
on
pretences
which
make
us
blush
to
think
what
nonsense
they
are
and
because
a
rival
has
come
to
supplant
me
in
my
profession
but
with
all
this
we
have
nothing
to
do
the
truth
to
us
is
that
we
are
living
in
the
midst
of
malice
and
hatred
and
that
poverty
stares
us
in
the
face
if
these
things
are
quite
enough
for
our
strength
and
i
imagine
we
shall
find
they
are
so
we
have
no
business
to
quarrel
with
our
trial
because
it
is
not
of
a
grander
kind
well
wife
and
sister
we
stay
is
it
not
so
then
i
will
go
and
write
to
mr
rowland
the
sisters
were
silent
for
some
moments
after
he
had
left
them
margaret
was
refreshing
her
flowers
the
flowers
which
philip
had
brought
in
from
the
garden
the
day
before
how
precious
were
they
now
even
above
other
flowers
brought
by
the
same
hand
for
not
another
blossom
was
left
in
the
desolate
garden
margaret
was
resolving
silently
that
she
would
keep
these
alive
as
long
as
she
could
and
then
dry
them
in
memory
of
the
place
they
came
from
in
its
wedding
trim
hester
presently
showed
the
direction
her
thoughts
had
taken
by
saying
i
should
think
that
it
must
be
always
possible
for
able
and
industrious
people
in
health
to
obtain
bread
almost
always
possible
provided
they
can
cast
pride
behind
them
ah
i
suspect
that
pride
is
the
real
evil
of
poverty
of
poverty
i
could
not
promise
for
my
own
part
to
cast
pride
behind
me
but
then
you
know
it
has
pleased
god
to
give
me
something
to
be
proud
of
far
different
from
rank
and
money
i
could
go
to
jail
or
the
workhouse
with
my
husband
without
a
blush
the
agony
of
it
would
not
be
from
pride
happily
we
are
sure
of
bread
mere
bread
said
margaret
for
the
present
and
for
what
we
call
certainty
what
you
and
i
have
is
enough
for
bread
what
i
have
can
hardly
be
called
sufficient
for
even
that
said
hester
and
you
i
must
speak
my
thankfulness
for
that
you
will
soon
be
out
of
the
reach
of
such
considerations
not
soon
and
i
can
not
separate
my
life
from
yours
i
can
not
fancy
it
do
not
let
us
fancy
it
just
now
well
we
will
not
i
am
glad
susan
has
warning
from
me
to
go
it
is
well
that
we
began
retrenching
so
soon
we
must
come
to
some
full
explanation
with
morris
that
we
may
see
what
can
best
be
done
for
her
she
will
never
leave
you
while
you
will
let
her
stay
it
may
be
necessary
to
dismiss
charles
but
we
will
wait
to
talk
that
over
with
my
husband
he
will
tell
us
what
we
ought
to
do
was
that
a
knock
at
the
door
i
rather
think
it
was
a
feeble
knock
it
was
mrs
grey
accompanied
by
sydney
mrs
grey
countenance
wore
an
expression
of
solemn
misery
with
a
little
of
the
complacency
of
excitement
under
it
the
occasion
was
too
great
for
winks
mute
grief
was
the
mood
of
the
hour
sydney
was
evidently
full
of
awe
he
seemed
hardly
to
like
to
come
into
the
parlour
margaret
had
to
go
to
the
door
and
laugh
at
him
for
his
shyness
his
mother
ideas
were
as
much
deranged
as
his
own
by
the
gaiety
with
which
hester
received
them
boasting
of
the
thorough
ventilation
of
the
room
and
asking
whether
sophia
did
not
think
their
bonfire
surpassed
the
famous
one
at
the
last
election
but
one
sophia
had
not
seen
anything
of
the
fire
of
last
night
she
had
been
so
much
agitated
that
the
whole
family
mr
grey
and
all
had
been
obliged
to
exert
themselves
to
compose
her
spirits
much
as
she
had
wished
to
come
this
morning
to
make
her
inquiries
in
person
she
had
been
unable
to
summon
courage
to
appear
in
the
streets
and
indeed
her
parents
could
not
press
it
she
had
been
so
extremely
agitated
she
was
now
left
in
alice
charge
hester
and
margaret
hoped
that
when
sophia
found
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
and
that
her
cousins
were
perfectly
well
she
would
be
able
to
spare
alice
for
some
hours
to
wait
upon
miss
young
maria
hostess
was
with
her
now
and
margaret
would
spend
the
night
with
her
again
if
a
nurse
could
not
be
procured
before
that
time
mrs
grey
had
not
neglected
maria
in
her
anxiety
for
her
cousins
she
was
just
going
to
propose
that
alice
should
be
the
nurse
and
had
left
word
at
miss
young
door
that
she
herself
would
visit
her
for
the
hour
and
half
that
people
were
in
church
her
time
this
morning
was
therefore
short
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
her
young
friends
look
so
much
like
themselves
so
differently
from
what
she
had
dared
to
expect
and
mr
hope
it
was
not
fair
perhaps
to
ask
where
he
was
he
had
probably
rather
not
have
it
known
where
he
might
be
found
and
here
the
countenance
relaxed
into
a
winking
frame
not
afraid
to
show
himself
abroad
had
been
out
twice
and
without
any
bad
consequences
it
would
be
a
cordial
to
sophia
to
hear
this
and
a
great
relief
to
mr
grey
but
what
courage
it
was
a
fine
lesson
for
sydney
if
mr
hope
was
really
only
writing
and
could
spare
a
minute
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
see
him
hester
went
for
him
he
had
just
finished
his
letter
she
read
and
approved
it
and
sat
down
to
take
a
copy
of
it
while
her
husband
occupied
her
seat
beside
mrs
grey
the
wife
let
fall
a
few
tears
tears
of
gentle
sorrow
and
proud
love
not
on
her
husband
letter
for
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
had
that
letter
bear
a
trace
of
tears
but
on
the
paper
on
which
she
wrote
the
letter
appeared
to
her
very
touching
but
others
might
not
think
so
there
was
so
much
in
it
which
she
alone
could
see
it
took
her
only
a
few
minutes
to
copy
it
but
the
copying
gave
her
strength
for
all
the
day
the
letter
was
as
follows
my
dear
sir
your
letter
expresses
both
in
its
matter
and
phrase
the
personal
regard
which
i
have
always
believed
you
to
entertain
towards
me
and
mine
i
can
not
agree
with
you
however
in
thinking
that
the
proceeding
you
propose
involves
real
good
to
any
of
the
parties
concerned
in
it
the
peace
of
society
in
deerbrook
is
not
likely
to
be
permanently
secured
by
such
deference
to
ignorant
prejudice
as
would
be
expressed
by
the
act
of
my
departure
nor
would
my
wrongs
be
repaired
by
my
merely
leaving
them
behind
me
i
can
not
take
money
from
your
hands
as
the
price
of
your
tranquillity
and
as
a
commutation
for
my
good
name
and
the
just
rewards
of
my
professional
labours
my
wife
and
i
will
not
remove
from
deerbrook
we
shall
stay
and
endeavour
to
discharge
our
duty
and
to
bear
our
wrongs
till
our
neighbours
learn
to
understand
us
better
than
they
do
you
will
permit
to
say
with
the
respect
which
i
feel
that
we
sympathise
fully
in
the
distress
of
mind
which
you
must
be
experiencing
if
you
should
find
comfort
in
doing
us
manful
justice
we
shall
congratulate
you
yet
more
than
ourselves
if
not
we
shall
grieve
for
you
only
the
more
deeply
my
wife
joins
me
in
what
i
have
said
and
in
kindly
regards
yours
sincerely
edward
hope
edward
had
left
his
seal
with
hester
she
sealed
the
letter
rang
for
charles
and
charged
him
to
deliver
it
into
mr
rowland
own
hands
placed
the
copy
in
her
bosom
to
show
to
margaret
and
returned
to
the
parlour
mrs
grey
who
was
alone
with
hope
stopped
short
in
what
she
was
saying
go
on
said
hope
we
have
no
secrets
here
and
no
fears
of
being
frightened
for
one
another
any
more
than
for
ourselves
mrs
grey
was
saying
my
dear
that
mr
walcot
is
very
popular
here
already
and
that
everybody
is
going
to
church
to
see
him
mrs
grey
had
faults
or
oddities
of
mr
walcot
to
tell
of
already
but
she
was
quietly
checked
in
the
middle
of
her
list
by
mr
hope
who
observed
that
he
was
bound
to
exercise
the
same
justice
towards
mr
walcot
that
he
hoped
to
receive
from
him
to
listen
to
no
evil
of
him
which
could
not
be
substantiated
and
it
was
certainly
too
early
yet
for
anything
to
be
known
about
him
by
strangers
beyond
what
he
looked
like
to
go
no
deeper
than
his
looks
then
continued
mrs
grey
nobody
can
pretend
to
admire
them
he
is
extremely
short
have
you
heard
how
short
he
is
yes
that
inspired
me
with
some
respect
for
him
to
begin
with
i
have
heard
so
much
of
my
being
too
tall
all
my
life
that
i
am
apt
to
feel
a
profound
veneration
for
men
who
have
made
the
furthest
escape
from
that
evil
by
the
way
my
dear
i
should
not
wonder
if
enderby
is
disposed
in
walcot
favour
by
this
for
he
is
even
taller
than
i
i
am
surprised
that
you
can
joke
on
such
a
subject
mr
hope
i
assure
you
you
are
not
the
only
sufferers
by
this
extraordinary
circumstance
of
mr
walcot
arrival
it
is
very
hard
upon
us
that
we
are
to
have
him
for
an
opposite
neighbour
in
mrs
enderby
house
you
know
sophia
and
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
observing
that
house
for
the
old
lady
sake
many
times
in
a
day
we
scarcely
ever
looked
out
but
we
saw
her
cap
over
the
blind
or
some
one
or
another
was
at
the
door
about
one
little
affair
or
another
it
has
been
a
great
blank
since
she
was
removed
the
shutters
shut
and
the
bills
up
and
nobody
going
and
coming
but
now
we
can
never
look
that
way
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
get
paxton
to
put
up
a
weathercock
for
you
on
his
barn
so
that
you
may
look
in
the
opposite
direction
for
the
wind
nay
edward
it
is
really
an
evil
said
hester
to
have
an
unwelcome
stranger
settled
in
an
opposite
house
where
an
old
friend
has
long
lived
i
can
sympathise
with
mrs
grey
so
can
i
my
dear
it
is
an
evil
but
i
should
under
any
circumstances
hold
myself
free
to
look
out
of
my
window
in
any
direction
that
is
all
do
mrs
grey
indulge
yourself
so
far
we
can
not
possibly
notice
him
you
know
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
an
interloper
like
mr
walcot
mr
grey
is
quite
of
my
opinion
you
will
have
our
support
in
every
way
my
dear
sir
for
it
is
perfectly
plain
to
our
minds
that
all
this
would
not
have
happened
but
for
your
having
married
into
our
connection
so
decidedly
but
this
intruder
has
been
thought
and
talked
about
by
us
more
than
he
is
worth
i
want
to
hear
all
you
can
tell
me
about
the
riot
hester
love
your
husband
has
been
giving
me
some
idea
of
it
but
bless
me
there
is
the
first
bell
for
church
and
i
ought
to
have
been
at
miss
young
by
this
time
we
must
have
the
whole
story
some
day
soon
and
indeed
sophia
would
quarrel
with
me
for
hearing
it
when
she
is
not
by
where
is
sydney
sydney
and
margaret
were
in
the
garden
consulting
about
its
restoration
sydney
declared
he
would
come
and
work
at
it
every
day
till
it
was
cleared
and
planted
he
would
begin
with
the
cairn
for
the
i
am
glad
the
levitts
are
to
call
after
church
observed
mrs
grey
they
always
do
what
is
proper
i
must
say
and
not
less
towards
dissenters
than
their
own
people
i
suppose
dr
levitt
will
consult
with
you
about
the
damages
sooner
or
later
i
have
no
doubt
come
sydney
we
must
be
gone
you
hear
the
bell
sophia
will
be
quite
revived
by
what
i
shall
tell
her
my
dears
no
do
not
come
out
to
the
door
i
will
not
allow
it
on
my
account
there
is
no
knowing
what
i
might
have
to
answer
for
if
you
let
yourself
be
seen
at
the
door
on
my
account
i
am
sorry
you
will
not
come
in
this
evening
are
you
quite
determined
well
perhaps
mr
grey
will
say
you
are
right
not
to
leave
your
premises
in
the
evening
at
present
no
you
must
not
say
anything
about
coming
just
now
we
have
not
courage
really
for
that
now
hold
your
tongue
sydney
it
is
out
of
the
question
your
being
out
of
our
sight
after
dark
good
morning
my
love
as
soon
as
charles
returned
home
after
having
delivered
the
letter
into
mr
rowland
own
hands
mr
hope
gathered
his
family
together
for
their
sunday
worship
the
servants
entered
the
room
with
countenances
full
of
the
melancholy
which
they
concluded
notwithstanding
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
their
master
and
mistress
must
be
experiencing
but
when
service
was
over
they
retired
with
the
feeling
that
the
had
never
been
more
gladsome
chapter
thirty
one
keeping
sunday
mr
enderby
was
in
the
churchyard
when
the
congregation
poured
out
from
the
porch
group
after
group
walked
away
and
he
saw
no
signs
of
the
party
he
was
waiting
for
mrs
rowland
lingered
in
the
aisle
with
the
intention
of
allowing
all
deerbrook
time
to
look
at
mr
walcot
when
none
but
the
levitts
remained
the
lady
issued
forth
from
the
porch
leaning
on
mr
walcot
arm
and
followed
by
four
of
her
children
who
were
walking
two
and
two
holding
up
their
heads
and
glancing
round
to
see
how
many
people
were
observing
the
new
gentleman
they
had
brought
with
them
from
cheltenham
mr
enderby
approached
the
family
party
and
said
sister
will
you
introduce
me
to
mr
walcot
with
the
greatest
pleasure
my
dear
brother
mr
walcot
my
brother
mr
enderby
brother
my
friend
mr
walcot
mr
walcot
blushed
with
delight
looked
as
if
he
longed
to
shake
hands
if
he
dared
and
said
something
of
his
joy
at
becoming
acquainted
with
the
brother
of
so
kind
a
friend
as
mrs
rowland
there
is
not
much
to
be
apprehended
here
thought
mr
enderby
how
perfectly
unlike
what
i
had
fancied
this
dragon
which
was
to
devour
the
hopes
seems
a
pretty
harmless
creature
why
he
looks
a
mere
boy
and
with
hair
so
light
one
ca
see
it
without
spectacles
what
will
he
do
with
himself
in
my
mother
good
house
fanny
grey
would
suit
him
better
and
then
he
might
hang
in
rowland
hall
and
be
always
ready
for
use
when
the
children
are
ill
i
must
have
out
what
i
mean
to
say
to
him
however
and
from
his
looks
i
should
fancy
i
may
do
what
i
please
with
him
he
will
go
away
before
dinner
if
i
ask
him
i
have
little
doubt
i
wonder
that
while
she
was
about
it
priscilla
did
not
find
out
somebody
who
had
the
outside
of
a
professional
man
at
least
this
youth
looks
as
if
he
would
not
draw
one
tooth
for
the
world
because
it
would
hurt
one
so
how
he
admires
the
rooks
and
the
green
grass
on
the
graves
because
the
children
do
sister
he
continued
aloud
i
am
sorry
to
deprive
you
of
your
companion
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
mr
walcot
and
i
should
have
some
conversation
together
immediately
the
children
will
go
home
with
you
and
we
will
follow
presently
mrs
rowland
looked
thunder
and
lightning
at
her
brother
but
mr
walcot
appeared
so
highly
pleased
that
she
considered
it
safest
to
acquiesce
in
the
present
arrangement
trusting
to
undo
philip
work
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
so
she
sailed
away
with
the
children
this
is
no
time
for
ceremony
observed
enderby
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
walk
under
the
trees
i
have
used
none
with
my
sister
as
you
perceive
and
i
shall
use
none
with
you
thank
you
sir
my
dear
parents
have
always
taught
me
that
there
could
be
no
occasion
for
ceremony
where
people
feel
kindly
and
mean
only
what
is
right
they
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
you
do
not
think
ceremony
necessary
between
us
the
circumstances
are
too
urgent
for
it
in
the
present
case
that
is
what
i
mean
said
philip
i
am
confident
mr
walcot
from
what
you
say
about
feeling
kindly
and
meaning
rightly
that
you
can
not
be
aware
what
is
the
real
state
of
affairs
in
deerbrook
or
you
could
not
have
been
induced
to
think
of
settling
here
oh
i
assure
you
sir
you
are
mistaken
mrs
rowland
herself
was
the
person
who
told
me
all
about
it
and
i
repeated
all
she
said
to
my
parents
they
strongly
advised
my
coming
and
i
am
sure
they
would
never
recommend
me
to
do
anything
that
was
not
right
then
if
i
tell
you
what
i
know
to
be
the
true
state
of
the
case
here
will
you
represent
it
fully
to
your
parents
and
see
what
they
will
say
then
certainly
i
can
have
no
objection
to
that
they
will
be
very
sorry
however
if
any
difficulty
should
arise
i
had
a
letter
from
them
this
very
morning
in
which
they
say
that
they
consider
me
a
fortunate
youth
to
have
fallen
in
with
such
a
friend
as
mrs
rowland
who
promises
she
will
be
a
mother
or
rather
i
should
say
a
sister
to
me
and
to
have
stepped
at
once
into
such
practice
as
mrs
rowland
says
i
shall
certainly
have
here
they
say
what
is
very
true
that
it
is
a
singular
and
happy
chance
to
befall
a
youth
who
has
only
just
finished
his
education
that
is
so
true
that
you
ought
not
to
be
surprised
if
it
should
turn
out
that
there
is
something
wrong
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
i
am
going
to
show
you
what
this
wrong
is
that
you
may
take
warning
in
time
and
not
discover
when
it
is
too
late
that
you
have
been
injuring
an
honourable
man
who
has
been
too
hardly
treated
already
i
should
be
sorry
to
do
that
but
i
can
not
think
what
you
can
mean
i
dare
say
not
pray
have
you
been
told
of
a
mr
hope
who
lives
here
oh
yes
we
saw
the
people
breaking
his
windows
as
we
drove
past
yesterday
evening
he
must
be
a
very
improper
disagreeable
man
and
it
is
very
hard
upon
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
here
to
have
no
one
to
attend
them
but
that
sort
of
person
that
is
one
account
of
mr
hope
now
you
must
hear
the
other
and
mr
enderby
gave
a
full
statement
of
hope
character
past
services
and
present
position
in
terms
which
he
conceived
to
be
level
with
the
capacity
of
the
young
man
he
kept
his
sister
out
of
the
story
as
far
as
it
was
possible
but
did
not
soften
the
statement
of
her
calumnies
though
refraining
from
exhibiting
their
origin
now
said
he
at
the
end
of
his
story
have
i
not
shown
cause
for
consideration
as
to
whether
you
should
settle
here
or
not
for
consideration
certainly
but
you
see
it
is
so
difficult
to
know
what
to
think
here
is
mrs
rowland
telling
me
one
set
of
things
about
mr
hope
and
you
tell
me
something
quite
different
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
shall
consult
my
parents
of
course
had
not
you
better
set
off
by
the
coach
morning
and
tell
your
parents
all
about
it
before
you
commit
yourself
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
do
that
very
well
as
i
have
engaged
to
go
over
and
see
these
people
in
sir
william
hunter
almshouses
that
i
am
to
have
the
charge
of
no
i
think
my
best
way
will
be
this
i
will
write
fully
to
my
parents
first
i
will
do
that
this
afternoon
then
considering
that
i
have
said
i
shall
stay
here
and
that
the
house
is
going
to
be
got
ready
for
me
and
considering
how
hard
it
is
upon
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
here
to
have
nobody
to
attend
them
but
a
person
they
do
not
like
and
considering
too
that
i
can
not
tell
for
myself
what
mr
hope
really
is
while
people
differ
so
about
him
i
think
i
had
better
wait
here
just
as
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
not
told
me
all
this
till
mrs
rowland
and
you
and
sir
william
hunter
and
everybody
have
settled
whether
mr
hope
is
really
a
good
man
or
not
and
then
you
know
i
can
go
away
after
all
if
i
please
philip
thought
that
dr
levitt
must
have
been
preaching
to
his
new
parishioner
to
join
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
with
the
harmlessness
of
the
dove
mr
walcot
himself
seemed
quietly
satisfied
with
his
own
decision
for
he
adhered
to
it
repeating
it
in
answer
to
every
appeal
that
philip
could
devise
i
think
it
right
to
warn
you
said
philip
that
if
the
prospect
of
being
my
mother
medical
attendant
has
been
part
of
your
inducement
to
settle
here
you
have
been
misled
in
relying
on
it
my
mother
is
much
attached
to
mr
hope
and
his
family
she
prefers
him
to
every
other
medical
attendant
and
i
shall
take
care
that
she
has
her
own
way
in
this
particular
while
i
am
in
mrs
rowland
house
i
shall
of
course
attend
mrs
rowland
family
replied
mr
walcot
her
children
if
she
pleases
but
not
necessarily
her
mother
yes
her
mother
too
as
i
dare
say
you
will
see
you
will
allow
mrs
enderby
to
choose
her
own
medical
attendant
i
presume
oh
yes
and
i
have
no
doubt
she
will
choose
me
mrs
rowland
says
so
here
comes
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
want
to
speak
said
philip
seeing
mr
grey
approaching
from
a
distance
he
is
as
warm
a
friend
and
admirer
of
mr
hope
as
i
am
and
mr
hope
married
into
his
family
did
not
he
yes
but
mr
grey
and
mr
hope
were
friends
long
before
either
of
them
was
acquainted
with
mrs
hope
the
friendship
between
the
gentlemen
was
more
likely
to
have
caused
the
marriage
than
the
marriage
the
friendship
ah
that
does
happen
sometimes
i
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
this
mr
walcot
that
mr
hope
friends
have
determined
to
see
justice
done
him
and
that
if
in
the
prosecution
of
this
design
you
should
imagine
that
you
are
remarkably
coolly
treated
by
myself
for
instance
you
must
remember
that
i
fairly
warned
you
from
the
beginning
that
i
shall
give
no
countenance
to
any
one
who
comes
knowingly
to
establish
himself
on
the
ruins
of
a
traduced
man
reputation
you
will
remember
this
mr
walcot
oh
certainly
i
am
sure
i
shall
expect
nothing
from
anybody
for
nobody
here
knows
me
it
is
only
through
mrs
rowland
kindness
that
i
have
any
prospect
here
at
all
i
will
just
give
you
one
more
warning
as
you
seem
a
very
young
man
the
deerbrook
people
are
apt
to
be
extremely
angry
when
they
are
angry
at
all
what
would
you
think
of
it
if
they
should
break
your
windows
as
they
broke
mr
hope
last
night
when
they
find
that
you
have
been
thriving
upon
his
practice
while
they
were
under
a
mistake
concerning
him
which
you
were
fully
informed
of
i
do
not
think
i
should
mind
it
i
might
get
over
it
you
know
as
mr
hope
would
then
have
done
or
i
might
go
away
after
all
if
i
pleased
but
you
want
to
speak
to
that
gentleman
so
i
will
wish
you
good
morning
you
will
represent
to
your
parents
all
i
have
said
then
pray
do
not
omit
the
last
about
what
dreadful
people
the
deerbrook
people
are
when
they
are
angry
and
how
likely
it
is
that
they
may
be
very
angry
with
you
some
day
i
advise
you
by
all
means
to
mention
this
yes
certainly
thank
you
i
shall
write
this
afternoon
i
wish
mrs
rowland
joy
of
her
fledgling
said
enderby
as
he
joined
mr
grey
i
was
just
thinking
as
you
and
he
came
up
that
a
few
lessons
from
the
at
blickley
would
do
him
no
harm
perhaps
however
your
sister
will
teach
him
to
hold
up
his
head
better
i
rather
think
he
is
a
little
scared
with
the
rooks
is
not
he
what
in
the
world
is
your
sister
to
do
with
him
now
she
has
got
him
here
i
hope
little
anna
will
lend
him
her
cup
and
ball
on
rainy
days
do
you
find
him
a
simpleton
i
hardly
know
one
must
see
him
more
than
once
to
be
quite
sure
but
enough
of
him
for
the
present
i
have
just
come
from
the
but
i
am
not
going
to
talk
about
the
hopes
either
and
yet
i
have
something
out
of
the
common
way
to
say
to
you
my
good
friend
i
am
glad
you
call
me
by
that
name
observed
mr
grey
kindly
i
never
could
see
for
the
life
of
me
why
men
should
look
askance
upon
one
another
because
their
relations
no
matter
on
which
side
or
perhaps
on
both
happen
to
be
more
or
less
in
the
wrong
and
there
are
other
reasons
why
you
and
i
should
beware
of
being
affected
by
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
our
connections
mr
grey
and
that
is
what
i
have
now
to
say
i
mean
because
we
may
become
connected
ourselves
how
will
you
like
me
for
a
relation
i
wonder
it
is
so
then
it
is
so
and
it
is
by
margaret
desire
that
i
inform
you
of
it
now
before
the
circumstance
becomes
generally
known
if
you
think
mrs
grey
will
be
gratified
by
early
information
i
believe
i
must
beg
that
you
will
go
home
and
tell
her
directly
we
are
as
fully
aware
as
you
can
be
of
the
absurdity
of
this
way
of
talking
but
circumstances
compel
us
to
i
know
i
understand
people
here
have
been
persuaded
that
you
were
engaged
to
some
other
lady
and
you
will
have
no
help
in
contradicting
this
from
your
own
family
who
may
not
like
your
marrying
into
our
connection
so
decidedly
as
i
have
heard
the
ladies
say
about
our
friend
hope
just
so
well
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
of
little
consequence
what
your
friends
may
say
now
when
time
is
so
sure
to
justify
your
choice
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
a
happy
man
mr
enderby
there
is
not
a
more
amiable
girl
living
than
that
cousin
margaret
of
mine
i
charge
you
to
make
her
happy
enderby
i
do
not
mean
that
i
have
any
doubt
of
it
but
i
charge
you
to
make
her
happy
philip
did
not
like
to
speak
any
more
than
to
do
other
things
without
being
pretty
sure
of
doing
it
well
he
was
silent
now
because
he
could
not
well
speak
he
was
anything
but
ashamed
of
his
attachment
to
margaret
but
he
could
not
open
his
lips
upon
it
i
trust
there
is
the
better
chance
of
her
being
happy
continued
mr
grey
that
she
is
going
to
marry
a
man
of
somewhat
less
enthusiasm
than
her
sister
has
chosen
mr
enderby
do
not
speak
of
that
mr
grey
we
might
not
agree
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
so
fully
sensible
of
my
immeasurable
inferiority
to
hope
i
know
i
am
hardly
worthy
to
appreciate
him
i
can
not
give
you
an
idea
of
my
sense
of
his
superiority
and
to
hear
him
set
below
me
do
not
mistake
me
my
dear
friend
no
one
can
value
mr
hope
more
than
i
do
as
indeed
i
have
every
reason
to
do
only
you
see
the
effects
of
that
unfortunate
vote
of
his
that
is
just
what
i
mean
now
if
you
had
been
in
his
place
i
rather
think
you
would
have
done
what
was
prudent
you
would
not
have
run
into
anything
so
useless
as
giving
that
vote
when
there
was
not
another
person
in
deerbrook
to
vote
the
same
way
you
would
not
enderby
i
trust
i
should
if
i
had
had
margaret
to
keep
me
up
to
my
duty
well
well
i
may
be
wrong
but
it
vexes
me
to
see
anxiety
and
sorrow
in
my
cousin
hester
beautiful
face
and
that
is
the
truth
of
it
but
indeed
her
husband
is
a
fine
fellow
and
i
respect
him
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
and
it
makes
me
extremely
happy
to
hear
that
margaret
has
met
with
one
whom
i
can
as
cordially
approve
you
have
my
hearty
good
wishes
i
assure
you
now
when
may
i
see
my
cousin
to
wish
her
joy
i
must
go
home
now
and
let
my
family
know
about
it
you
say
if
you
please
for
i
must
tell
margaret
how
kindly
you
have
received
what
i
had
to
communicate
she
will
be
waiting
anxiously
why
she
could
not
doubt
my
good
will
surely
how
should
i
be
otherwise
than
pleased
nor
have
i
any
doubt
of
my
wife
feeling
you
stand
very
high
in
her
good
graces
enderby
i
can
assure
you
i
was
not
fully
aware
of
this
myself
till
i
saw
how
vexed
she
was
at
hearing
that
you
were
engaged
to
that
lady
abroad
she
never
could
make
out
what
margaret
was
feeling
about
that
but
she
used
to
say
to
me
when
we
were
by
ourselves
that
if
margaret
was
not
hurt
and
angry
she
was
but
i
suppose
the
little
gipsy
was
laughing
at
us
and
all
deerbrook
all
the
time
though
she
kept
her
gravity
wonderfully
philip
was
not
disposed
to
throw
any
light
on
this
part
of
the
affair
and
the
gentlemen
parted
at
the
turnstile
after
a
few
steps
philip
heard
himself
called
mr
grey
was
hastening
after
him
to
know
whether
this
matter
was
to
be
spoken
of
or
to
remain
quiet
after
mrs
grey
had
been
informed
he
had
perfectly
understood
that
all
deerbrook
was
soon
to
know
it
but
it
was
a
different
question
whether
his
family
were
to
be
authorised
to
tell
it
mr
enderby
desired
they
would
follow
their
own
inclinations
entirely
margaret
only
wish
was
that
her
kind
relations
should
be
informed
directly
from
herself
before
anybody
else
but
her
friend
miss
young
and
his
own
only
desire
was
that
on
margaret
account
every
one
should
understand
that
his
engagement
was
to
her
and
not
to
any
lady
at
rome
or
elsewhere
virtual
provision
having
thus
been
made
for
the
enlightenment
of
all
deerbrook
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
gentlemen
once
more
went
their
respective
ways
in
her
present
mood
of
amiability
mrs
rowland
determined
on
giving
the
greys
the
pleasure
of
a
call
from
mr
walcot
in
the
afternoon
when
fanny
was
saying
her
catechism
to
her
mamma
and
mary
was
repeating
a
hymn
to
sophia
mrs
rowland
knock
was
heard
and
any
religious
feelings
which
might
have
been
aroused
in
the
minds
of
the
little
girls
were
put
to
flight
by
the
sound
sophia
turned
her
feet
off
the
sofa
where
she
had
been
lying
all
day
that
mrs
rowland
might
not
suspect
that
she
had
suffered
from
the
mobbing
of
the
hopes
the
children
were
enjoined
not
to
refer
to
it
and
were
recommended
to
avoid
the
subject
of
miss
young
also
if
possible
the
amazement
and
wrath
of
the
party
at
hearing
mr
walcot
announced
was
beyond
expression
mrs
grey
was
sufficiently
afraid
of
her
neighbour
to
confine
herself
to
negative
rudeness
she
did
the
most
she
dared
in
not
looking
at
mr
walcot
or
asking
him
to
sit
down
he
did
not
appear
to
miss
her
attentions
but
seated
himself
beside
her
daughter
and
offered
remarks
on
the
difference
between
deerbrook
and
cheltenham
sophia
made
no
intelligible
replies
and
looked
impenetrably
reserved
he
therefore
tried
another
subject
enlarged
upon
mrs
rowland
extreme
kindness
to
him
and
said
that
his
parents
wrote
that
they
considered
him
a
fortunate
youth
in
having
met
with
a
friend
who
would
be
a
mother
or
sister
to
him
now
that
he
was
no
longer
under
the
parental
wing
sophia
had
intended
to
be
quite
distant
and
silent
but
his
praises
of
all
the
rowlands
were
too
much
for
her
she
observed
that
it
was
generally
considered
that
there
was
nobody
in
deerbrook
to
compare
with
the
family
in
the
the
hopes
and
miss
ibbotson
from
this
moment
the
became
animated
the
speakers
alternated
rapidly
and
regularly
for
every
virtue
in
a
rowland
there
was
a
noble
quality
in
a
hope
for
every
accomplishment
in
matilda
and
anna
there
was
a
grace
in
our
dear
mr
hope
or
our
sweet
hester
fanny
and
mary
listened
with
some
amusement
to
what
they
heard
on
either
side
of
their
pair
of
low
stools
as
sure
as
they
were
desired
particularly
to
avoid
any
subject
with
the
rowlands
they
knew
that
their
mother
would
presently
be
in
the
midst
of
it
the
prohibition
showed
that
her
mind
was
full
of
it
and
whatever
her
mind
was
full
of
was
poured
out
upon
mrs
rowland
the
two
ladies
were
presently
deep
in
the
riot
and
almost
at
high
words
about
miss
young
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
strove
to
keep
the
corners
of
their
mouths
in
order
in
the
midst
of
the
conflict
of
sentiment
on
these
two
subjects
mrs
rowland
ear
caught
what
sophia
was
saying
that
there
was
one
person
in
the
same
house
with
mr
walcot
who
properly
estimated
the
hopes
mr
enderby
who
was
engaged
to
margaret
ibbotson
while
mr
walcot
was
carefully
explaining
that
mr
enderby
was
not
in
the
same
house
mr
enderby
having
a
bed
at
his
mother
house
still
though
that
house
was
already
preparing
for
the
reception
of
himself
its
new
tenant
mrs
rowland
leaned
forward
with
her
most
satirical
air
and
begged
to
assure
miss
grey
that
she
had
been
misinformed
that
what
she
had
just
been
saying
was
a
mistake
sophia
looked
at
her
mother
in
absolute
terror
lest
they
should
have
adopted
a
joke
of
her
father
for
earnest
but
mrs
grey
was
positive
mrs
rowland
laughed
more
and
more
provokingly
mrs
grey
grew
more
and
more
angry
and
at
last
sent
the
little
girls
to
see
whether
their
father
was
at
home
that
he
might
bear
his
testimony
he
came
and
in
reply
to
his
astonishment
about
what
she
could
mean
mrs
rowland
said
that
she
did
not
deny
that
there
was
some
present
entanglement
but
that
she
warned
margaret
connections
not
to
suppose
that
her
brother
would
ever
be
married
to
miss
ibbotson
mr
grey
observed
that
time
would
show
and
inquired
after
mrs
enderby
the
report
of
her
was
very
flattering
indeed
she
was
to
be
quite
well
now
soon
mr
opinion
of
her
case
was
precisely
what
mrs
rowland
had
always
held
mrs
enderby
complaints
were
nervous
nervous
altogether
with
retirement
from
common
acquaintances
and
the
society
of
the
dear
children
and
the
attendance
of
a
servant
most
highly
recommended
who
would
not
humour
her
fancies
as
phoebe
had
done
and
above
all
with
a
medical
attendant
under
the
same
roof
for
the
present
she
was
to
be
quite
well
immediately
mr
walcot
countenance
wore
an
expression
of
perfect
delight
at
the
prospect
and
mr
grey
of
the
blackest
displeasure
when
the
visitors
were
gone
mr
walcot
being
allowed
to
find
his
way
out
as
he
could
the
little
girls
heard
them
discussed
in
the
way
which
might
be
expected
and
were
then
desired
to
finish
their
catechism
and
hymn
mamma
and
sophia
were
still
flushed
and
agitated
with
what
they
had
been
hearing
and
saying
when
the
low
serious
voices
of
fanny
and
mary
recited
the
one
an
abjuration
of
all
envy
malice
hatred
and
uncharitableness
and
the
other
teach
me
to
feel
for
others
woe
to
hide
the
faults
i
see
the
mercy
i
to
others
show
that
mercy
show
to
me
you
have
a
warning
my
dear
said
mrs
grey
to
fanny
in
the
lady
who
was
here
just
now
a
terrible
warning
against
malice
and
all
those
faults
you
see
how
unhappy
she
makes
every
one
about
her
by
her
having
indulged
her
temper
to
such
a
degree
you
see
mary
my
darling
said
mr
grey
repeat
that
hymn
to
me
again
me
to
feel
for
others
woe
to
hide
the
faults
i
see
let
us
have
that
hymn
over
again
my
dear
child
chapter
thirty
two
going
to
rest
mr
walcot
had
arrived
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
letter
to
his
parents
when
summoned
to
attend
mrs
rowland
to
call
on
the
greys
he
was
afterwards
glad
that
he
had
left
room
to
put
in
that
perhaps
what
mr
enderby
had
said
about
deerbrook
ought
to
be
the
less
regarded
from
its
having
come
out
that
he
was
in
an
entanglement
with
the
of
this
mr
hope
when
he
had
rather
have
been
engaged
to
another
person
being
actually
indeed
attached
to
a
lady
now
abroad
he
represented
that
mrs
rowland
evidently
paid
very
little
regard
to
her
views
of
deerbrook
affairs
now
that
his
mind
was
in
a
state
of
distraction
between
his
proper
attachment
and
his
new
entanglement
so
mr
enderby
opinion
ought
not
to
go
for
more
than
it
was
worth
the
letter
was
still
not
quite
finished
when
he
was
called
to
mrs
enderby
she
was
very
ill
and
mr
rowland
and
phoebe
were
alarmed
philip
was
at
the
mrs
rowland
was
gone
to
see
miss
young
to
convince
her
that
she
must
put
herself
into
mr
walcot
hands
immediately
to
declare
indeed
that
she
should
send
her
own
medical
man
to
attend
her
dear
children
governess
the
argument
occupied
some
time
and
mrs
rowland
absence
was
protracted
mrs
enderby
had
been
extremely
terrified
the
evening
before
at
the
noises
she
had
heard
and
the
light
of
the
bonfire
upon
the
sky
the
children
were
permitted
to
carry
to
her
all
the
extravagant
reports
that
were
afloat
about
mr
hope
being
roasted
in
the
fire
the
ladies
being
in
the
hands
of
the
mob
and
so
forth
and
though
her
had
seen
her
before
she
settled
for
the
night
and
had
assured
her
that
everybody
was
safe
she
could
not
be
tranquillised
she
thought
he
was
deceiving
her
for
her
good
and
that
the
children
were
probably
nearest
the
truth
she
was
unable
to
close
her
eyes
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
told
phoebe
that
she
could
not
be
satisfied
she
should
not
have
a
moment
peace
till
she
had
seen
some
one
of
the
dear
people
from
the
to
know
from
themselves
that
they
were
quite
safe
phoebe
had
found
it
difficult
to
persuade
her
that
it
was
now
two
in
the
morning
and
that
they
were
all
no
doubt
sleeping
in
their
beds
she
passed
a
wretched
night
and
the
next
day
after
philip
had
succeeded
in
composing
her
a
strange
gentleman
was
brought
to
her
to
prescribe
for
her
this
revived
her
terrors
she
said
she
would
ask
no
more
questions
for
all
were
in
league
to
deceive
her
then
she
cried
because
she
had
said
so
harsh
a
thing
and
begged
that
phoebe
would
not
expose
it
her
weeping
continued
till
phoebe
heart
was
almost
broken
the
infallible
drops
failed
arrowroot
was
in
vain
the
children
were
sent
away
as
soon
as
they
came
in
as
it
would
hurt
their
spirits
their
mother
thought
to
see
distress
of
this
kind
in
the
afternoon
quiet
was
prescribed
by
the
authorities
and
the
old
lady
was
left
alone
with
phoebe
to
the
weeping
succeeded
the
spasms
so
violent
that
little
george
was
despatched
with
all
speed
to
summon
his
uncle
and
mr
walcot
was
called
away
from
crossing
the
ends
of
his
letter
no
one
but
he
proposed
sending
for
mrs
rowland
and
his
hint
to
that
effect
was
not
taken
philip
arrived
in
a
shorter
time
than
could
have
been
supposed
possible
mr
rowland
then
immediately
disappeared
he
had
formed
the
heroic
resolution
of
bringing
margaret
into
the
house
on
his
own
responsibility
for
mrs
enderby
relief
and
gratification
and
he
was
gone
to
tell
margaret
that
he
considered
her
now
as
mrs
daughter
and
was
come
to
summon
her
to
the
sick
bed
philip
presently
discovered
that
the
presence
of
some
one
from
the
hopes
would
be
the
best
cordial
that
could
be
administered
and
he
set
forth
on
the
same
errand
to
bring
margaret
that
she
might
have
his
protection
in
case
of
his
sister
returning
before
her
arrival
mrs
rowland
did
return
and
the
two
gentlemen
having
taken
different
roads
to
the
it
being
a
matter
of
old
dispute
which
was
the
shortest
missed
each
other
margaret
was
gone
with
mr
rowland
before
philip
arrived
here
i
will
leave
you
said
mr
rowland
to
margaret
on
the
steps
of
his
own
house
you
will
find
philip
and
phoebe
upstairs
and
mr
walcot
i
must
go
in
search
of
mr
hope
and
beg
the
favour
of
him
to
tell
me
whether
we
are
proceeding
rightly
with
our
patient
she
is
too
ill
for
ceremony
margaret
wondered
why
if
this
was
the
case
mr
rowland
did
not
bring
edward
to
the
patient
at
once
but
she
had
her
wonder
to
herself
for
her
escort
was
gone
the
servant
did
not
more
than
the
door
and
seemed
unwilling
to
let
margaret
enter
but
she
passed
in
saying
that
she
must
see
phoebe
for
a
moment
she
soon
found
that
she
was
to
be
left
standing
on
the
mat
for
no
person
appeared
though
she
thought
she
heard
whispers
upstairs
ned
coming
to
peep
from
the
she
beckoned
him
to
her
and
asked
to
be
shown
to
where
phoebe
was
the
child
took
her
hand
and
led
her
upstairs
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
she
met
the
lady
of
the
house
who
asked
her
with
an
air
of
astonishment
what
she
wanted
there
margaret
replied
that
mr
rowland
had
brought
her
to
see
mrs
enderby
that
was
impossible
the
lady
replied
mr
rowland
knew
that
mrs
enderby
was
too
ill
to
receive
visitors
she
herself
would
send
for
miss
ibbotson
whenever
it
should
be
proper
for
mrs
enderby
to
admit
strangers
margaret
replied
that
she
must
see
phoebe
that
she
should
not
retire
till
she
had
spoken
to
her
or
till
mr
rowland
return
mrs
rowland
sent
ned
to
desire
the
servant
to
open
the
door
for
miss
ibbotson
and
margaret
took
her
seat
on
a
chair
on
the
landing
saying
that
relying
on
her
title
to
be
admitted
to
mrs
enderby
at
the
desire
of
her
old
friend
herself
and
of
all
the
family
but
mrs
rowland
she
should
wait
till
she
could
obtain
admittance
how
rejoiced
was
she
at
this
moment
to
hear
the
house
door
open
to
hear
the
step
she
knew
so
well
to
see
philip
and
to
have
her
arm
drawn
within
his
let
us
pass
said
he
to
his
sister
who
stopped
the
way
rest
a
moment
said
margaret
recover
your
breath
a
little
or
we
shall
flurry
her
she
is
flurried
to
death
already
said
philip
in
his
deepest
tone
of
emotion
priscilla
our
mother
is
dying
it
is
my
belief
that
she
is
dying
if
you
have
any
humanity
if
you
have
any
regard
for
your
own
future
peace
of
mind
conduct
yourself
decently
now
govern
your
own
family
as
you
will
when
you
have
lost
your
mother
but
hold
off
your
hand
from
her
last
hours
your
own
last
hours
are
to
come
said
margaret
as
you
would
have
matilda
be
to
you
then
be
you
to
your
mother
now
i
must
ascertain
one
thing
philip
said
mrs
rowland
does
my
mother
know
of
what
you
call
your
engagement
to
miss
ibbotson
she
does
not
and
the
sole
reason
is
that
i
would
not
subject
her
to
what
you
might
say
and
do
i
wished
for
her
own
sake
to
keep
the
whole
affair
out
of
her
thoughts
when
once
i
had
removed
the
false
impressions
you
had
given
her
but
margaret
and
i
may
see
fit
to
tell
her
now
i
may
see
fit
to
give
her
the
comfort
of
a
daughter
who
will
be
to
her
what
you
ought
to
have
been
he
gently
drew
his
sister
aside
to
make
way
for
margaret
to
pass
in
my
own
house
exclaimed
mrs
rowland
in
a
tone
of
subdued
rage
we
should
have
been
in
the
house
over
the
way
replied
her
brother
and
we
act
as
if
we
were
there
come
my
margaret
we
are
doing
right
we
are
replied
margaret
but
yet
she
trembled
i
must
go
in
first
and
tell
her
that
i
have
brought
you
said
philip
and
yet
i
do
not
like
to
leave
you
even
for
a
moment
oh
never
mind
i
am
not
to
be
shaken
now
mrs
rowland
did
not
appear
during
the
two
long
minutes
that
margaret
was
left
by
herself
in
the
when
philip
came
for
her
he
said
you
must
not
leave
her
again
you
will
stay
will
not
you
you
shall
be
protected
but
you
must
stay
i
shall
tell
her
how
we
stand
to
each
other
we
will
tell
her
carefully
for
she
can
not
bear
much
you
are
tired
you
must
be
tired
he
continued
looking
at
her
with
anxiety
but
do
not
speak
of
it
i
did
sleep
last
night
and
there
will
be
time
enough
for
sleep
when
duty
is
done
the
duty
for
which
i
have
longed
ever
since
i
knew
what
duty
was
and
her
eyes
swam
in
tears
phoebe
face
was
a
dismal
sight
too
dismal
for
the
sickroom
for
so
many
hours
had
she
been
in
tears
she
was
dismissed
to
refresh
herself
with
a
turn
in
the
garden
it
was
philip
doing
that
she
was
at
hand
at
all
mrs
rowland
had
ordained
that
she
should
go
but
philip
had
supported
the
girl
in
her
resolution
to
bear
anything
rather
than
leave
her
mistress
while
it
was
essential
to
her
mistress
comfort
that
she
should
stay
mrs
enderby
was
in
great
pain
but
yet
not
suffering
too
much
to
be
comforted
by
finding
that
all
were
safe
and
well
in
the
she
even
smiled
when
the
others
laughed
at
the
ridiculous
stories
with
which
the
children
had
assaulted
her
imagination
she
thought
it
was
very
wrong
for
people
to
fabricate
such
things
and
tell
them
to
children
they
might
chance
to
put
some
extremely
old
ladies
into
a
terrible
she
was
soothed
in
the
very
midst
of
a
spasm
by
hearing
that
margaret
would
stay
with
her
as
long
as
she
liked
if
it
would
be
of
any
comfort
to
her
in
answer
to
her
surprise
and
almost
alarm
at
such
a
blessing
philip
said
that
margaret
wished
it
as
a
pleasure
and
asked
it
as
a
sort
of
right
now
could
she
not
guess
any
reason
why
it
was
a
sort
of
right
of
margaret
to
attend
upon
her
like
a
daughter
yes
it
was
so
indeed
margaret
was
to
be
her
daughter
some
time
or
other
when
her
big
boy
should
have
learned
all
his
lessons
as
little
george
would
say
i
am
thankful
indeed
i
thankful
my
dears
to
hear
this
but
my
loves
that
will
be
too
late
for
me
i
rejoice
indeed
but
it
will
be
too
late
for
me
well
then
let
me
be
your
daughter
now
the
old
lady
clasped
her
arms
about
margaret
and
endured
her
next
paroxysm
with
her
head
upon
her
young
friend
shoulder
i
have
a
daughter
already
said
she
when
she
revived
a
little
but
i
have
room
in
my
heart
for
another
and
i
always
had
you
in
my
heart
my
love
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
you
hold
all
the
world
in
your
heart
i
think
ah
my
love
you
flatter
me
i
mean
i
took
to
you
particularly
from
the
very
hour
i
saw
you
you
have
always
been
so
kind
and
gentle
with
me
margaret
heart
swelled
at
the
thought
that
any
one
could
ever
have
been
otherwise
than
kind
and
gentle
to
one
so
lowly
and
so
loving
nothing
more
could
be
done
than
was
done
for
the
sufferer
hope
saw
her
at
mr
rowland
desire
and
said
this
he
left
directions
with
margaret
and
then
declined
staying
where
his
presence
could
be
of
no
use
and
caused
much
annoyance
mrs
enderby
was
sinking
rapidly
the
probability
was
that
a
few
hours
would
end
the
struggle
mrs
rowland
was
much
alarmed
and
shocked
she
went
and
came
between
the
and
her
mother
chamber
but
talked
of
the
claims
of
her
children
at
such
a
time
and
persuaded
herself
that
her
duty
lay
chiefly
with
them
others
wanted
no
persuasion
about
the
matter
they
were
too
glad
to
have
her
dispose
herself
where
she
would
be
out
of
her
way
mrs
enderby
looked
round
now
and
then
and
seemed
as
if
on
the
point
of
asking
for
her
but
that
her
courage
failed
at
last
about
eight
in
the
evening
when
mrs
rowland
had
come
in
softly
and
phoebe
had
met
her
at
the
door
to
say
something
very
unceremonious
mrs
enderby
voice
was
heard
phoebe
i
hope
you
are
not
preventing
any
person
from
coming
in
i
should
wish
to
see
my
daughter
priscilla
my
dear
let
me
see
you
come
to
me
my
dear
mrs
rowland
face
was
very
pale
and
her
brow
told
of
a
dreadful
headache
there
was
a
dark
expression
in
her
countenance
but
the
traces
of
irritability
were
gone
she
was
subdued
for
the
hour
my
dear
daughter
said
mrs
enderby
i
may
not
be
able
at
another
time
to
thank
you
as
i
should
like
for
all
the
care
you
have
taken
of
me
nor
can
i
now
do
it
as
i
could
wish
but
i
thank
you
my
love
mrs
rowland
involuntarily
cast
a
glance
at
her
brother
and
margaret
to
see
how
they
took
this
but
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
mother
and
i
can
only
say
continued
mrs
enderby
that
i
am
aware
that
you
must
have
had
many
things
to
bear
from
me
i
must
have
been
much
in
your
way
and
often
margaret
and
philip
implored
her
to
say
nothing
of
this
kind
they
could
not
bear
it
from
one
who
was
all
patience
herself
and
gave
no
cause
for
forbearance
in
others
mrs
rowland
did
not
speak
perhaps
because
she
could
not
well
well
i
will
not
dwell
upon
these
things
you
are
all
very
kind
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
i
was
sensible
of
of
many
things
priscilla
mother
said
she
starting
this
dear
young
friend
of
ours
she
calls
herself
my
daughter
bless
her
is
to
be
your
sister
my
love
philip
has
been
telling
me
let
me
see
give
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
margaret
could
have
opened
her
arms
to
any
spectre
from
the
pale
kingdoms
at
a
moment
like
this
and
under
the
imploring
eye
of
mrs
enderby
she
disengaged
her
hand
from
that
of
her
old
friend
and
took
mrs
rowland
offering
to
kiss
her
cheek
mrs
rowland
returned
the
kiss
with
some
little
visible
agitation
thank
you
my
dears
said
mrs
enderby
in
a
strong
voice
of
satisfaction
she
had
made
a
great
effort
her
speech
now
failed
her
but
they
thought
she
would
have
said
something
about
the
children
the
children
said
mrs
rowland
rather
eagerly
she
turned
and
went
slowly
out
of
the
room
the
moment
the
door
was
shut
there
was
a
heavy
fall
she
had
fainted
on
the
outside
her
mother
heard
it
not
when
mrs
rowland
was
found
to
be
reviving
the
children
were
brought
to
their
grandmamma
room
they
quietly
visited
the
bed
one
by
one
and
with
solemnity
kissed
the
wasted
cheek
the
first
time
they
had
ever
kissed
grandmamma
without
return
the
baby
made
its
remark
upon
this
in
its
own
way
as
it
had
often
done
before
it
patted
the
cheek
rather
roughly
several
hands
were
instantly
stretched
out
to
stop
its
play
it
set
up
a
cry
and
was
hurried
out
of
the
room
by
the
middle
of
the
night
margaret
was
longing
to
be
at
home
and
alone
it
was
all
over
she
was
ashamed
to
think
of
her
own
share
of
the
loss
while
witnessing
philip
manly
grief
or
even
while
seeing
how
phoebe
lamented
and
how
mr
rowland
himself
was
but
not
the
less
for
this
was
her
heart
repeating
till
it
was
sick
of
itself
i
have
lost
another
mother
she
did
not
see
mrs
rowland
again
in
the
earliest
grey
of
the
morning
mr
rowland
took
margaret
home
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
waiting
to
be
let
in
she
observed
that
the
morning
star
was
yellow
and
bright
in
the
sky
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
risen
the
toll
of
the
church
bell
conveyed
to
every
ear
in
deerbrook
the
news
that
mrs
enderby
was
dead
perhaps
there
might
have
been
compunction
in
the
breasts
of
some
who
had
been
abroad
on
saturday
night
on
hearing
the
universal
remark
that
it
must
have
been
rather
sudden
at
last
chapter
thirty
three
moving
onward
the
world
rolls
on
let
what
may
be
happening
to
the
individuals
who
occupy
it
the
sun
rises
and
sets
and
harvest
come
and
go
generations
arise
and
pass
away
law
and
authority
hold
on
their
course
while
hundreds
of
millions
of
human
hearts
have
stirring
within
them
struggles
and
emotions
eternally
new
an
experience
so
diversified
as
that
no
two
days
appear
alike
to
any
one
and
to
no
two
does
any
one
day
appear
the
same
there
is
something
so
striking
in
this
perpetual
contrast
between
the
external
uniformity
and
internal
variety
of
the
procedure
of
existence
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
multitudes
have
formed
a
conception
of
fate
of
a
mighty
unchanging
power
blind
to
the
differences
of
spirits
and
deaf
to
the
appeals
of
human
delight
and
misery
a
huge
insensible
force
beneath
which
all
that
is
spiritual
is
sooner
or
later
wounded
and
is
ever
liable
to
be
crushed
this
conception
of
fate
is
grand
is
natural
and
fully
warranted
to
minds
too
lofty
to
be
satisfied
with
the
details
of
human
life
but
which
have
not
risen
to
the
far
higher
conception
of
a
providence
to
whom
this
uniformity
and
variety
are
but
means
to
a
higher
end
than
they
apparently
involve
there
is
infinite
blessing
in
having
reached
the
nobler
conception
the
feeling
of
helplessness
is
relieved
the
craving
for
sympathy
from
the
ruling
power
is
satisfied
there
is
a
hold
for
veneration
there
is
room
for
hope
there
is
above
all
the
stimulus
and
support
of
an
end
perceived
or
anticipated
a
purpose
which
steeps
in
sanctity
all
human
experience
yet
even
where
this
blessing
is
the
most
fully
felt
and
recognised
the
spirit
can
not
but
be
at
times
overwhelmed
by
the
vast
regularity
of
aggregate
existence
thrown
back
upon
its
faith
for
support
when
it
reflects
how
all
things
go
on
as
they
did
before
it
became
conscious
of
existence
and
how
all
would
go
on
as
now
if
it
were
to
die
on
it
rolls
not
only
the
great
globe
itself
but
the
life
which
stirs
and
hums
on
its
surface
enveloping
it
like
an
atmosphere
on
it
rolls
and
the
vastest
tumult
that
may
take
place
among
its
inhabitants
can
no
more
make
itself
seen
and
heard
above
the
general
stir
and
hum
of
life
than
chimborazo
or
the
loftiest
himalaya
can
lift
its
peak
into
space
above
the
atmosphere
on
on
it
rolls
and
the
strong
arm
of
the
united
race
could
not
turn
from
its
course
one
planetary
mote
of
the
myriads
that
swim
in
space
no
shriek
of
passion
nor
shrill
song
of
joy
sent
up
from
a
group
of
nations
on
a
continent
could
attain
the
ear
of
the
eternal
silence
as
she
sits
throned
among
the
stars
death
is
less
dreary
than
life
in
this
view
a
view
which
at
times
perhaps
presents
itself
to
every
mind
but
which
speedily
vanishes
before
the
faith
of
those
who
with
the
heart
believe
that
they
are
not
the
accidents
of
fate
but
the
children
of
a
father
in
the
house
of
every
wise
parent
may
then
be
seen
an
epitome
of
life
a
sight
whose
consolation
is
needed
at
times
perhaps
by
all
which
of
the
little
children
of
a
virtuous
household
can
conceive
of
his
entering
into
his
parent
pursuits
or
interfering
with
them
how
sacred
are
the
study
and
the
office
the
apparatus
of
a
knowledge
and
a
power
which
he
can
only
venerate
which
of
these
little
ones
dreams
of
disturbing
the
course
of
his
parent
thought
or
achievement
which
of
them
conceives
of
the
daily
routine
of
the
household
its
going
forth
and
coming
in
its
rising
and
its
rest
having
been
different
before
his
birth
or
that
it
would
be
altered
by
his
absence
it
is
even
a
matter
of
surprise
to
him
when
it
now
and
then
occurs
to
him
that
there
is
anything
set
apart
for
him
that
he
has
clothes
and
couch
and
that
his
mother
thinks
and
cares
for
him
if
he
lags
behind
in
a
walk
or
finds
himself
alone
among
the
trees
he
does
not
dream
of
being
missed
but
home
rises
up
before
him
as
he
has
always
seen
it
his
father
thoughtful
his
mother
occupied
and
the
rest
gay
with
the
one
difference
of
his
not
being
there
thus
he
believes
and
has
no
other
trust
than
in
his
shrieks
of
terror
for
being
ever
remembered
more
yet
all
the
while
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
without
one
moment
intermission
is
the
providence
of
his
parent
around
him
brooding
over
the
workings
of
his
infant
spirit
chastening
its
passions
nourishing
its
affections
now
troubling
it
with
salutary
pain
now
animating
it
with
even
more
wholesome
delight
all
the
while
is
the
order
of
household
affairs
regulated
for
the
comfort
and
profit
of
these
lowly
little
ones
though
they
regard
it
reverently
because
they
can
not
comprehend
it
they
may
not
know
of
all
this
how
their
guardian
bends
over
their
pillow
nightly
and
lets
no
word
of
their
careless
talk
drop
unheeded
hails
every
brightening
gleam
of
reason
and
records
every
sob
of
infant
grief
and
every
chirp
of
childish
glee
they
may
not
know
this
because
they
could
not
understand
it
aright
and
each
little
heart
would
be
inflated
with
pride
each
little
mind
would
lose
the
grace
and
purity
of
its
unconsciousness
but
the
guardianship
is
not
the
less
real
constant
and
tender
for
its
being
unrecognised
by
its
objects
as
the
spirit
expands
and
perceives
that
it
is
one
of
an
innumerable
family
it
would
be
in
danger
of
sinking
into
the
despair
of
loneliness
if
it
were
not
capable
of
belief
in
mercy
carried
infinite
degrees
beyond
the
tenderness
of
human
hearts
while
the
very
circumstance
of
multitude
obviates
the
danger
of
undue
elation
but
though
it
is
good
to
be
lowly
it
behoves
every
one
to
be
sensible
of
the
guardianship
of
which
so
many
evidences
are
around
all
who
breathe
while
the
world
and
life
roll
on
and
on
the
feeble
reason
of
the
child
of
providence
may
be
at
times
overpowered
with
the
vastness
of
the
system
amidst
which
he
lives
but
his
faith
will
smile
upon
his
fear
rebuke
him
for
averting
his
eyes
and
inspire
him
with
the
thought
nothing
can
crush
me
for
i
am
made
for
eternity
i
will
do
suffer
and
enjoy
as
my
father
wills
and
let
the
world
and
life
roll
on
such
is
the
faith
which
supports
which
alone
can
support
the
many
who
having
been
whirled
in
the
eddying
stream
of
social
affairs
are
withdrawn
by
one
cause
or
another
to
abide
in
some
still
little
creek
the
passage
of
the
mighty
tide
the
statesman
who
knows
himself
to
be
spoken
of
as
politically
dead
and
sees
his
successors
at
work
building
on
his
foundations
without
more
than
a
passing
thought
on
who
had
laboured
before
them
has
need
of
this
faith
the
aged
who
find
affairs
proceeding
at
the
will
of
the
young
and
hardy
whatever
the
may
think
and
say
have
need
of
this
faith
so
have
the
sick
when
they
find
none
but
themselves
disposed
to
look
on
life
in
the
light
which
comes
from
beyond
the
grave
so
have
the
persecuted
when
with
or
without
cause
they
see
themselves
pointed
at
in
the
streets
and
the
despised
who
find
themselves
neglected
whichever
way
they
turn
so
have
the
prosperous
during
those
moments
which
must
occur
to
all
when
sympathy
fails
and
means
to
much
desired
ends
are
wanting
or
when
satiety
makes
the
spirit
roam
abroad
in
search
of
something
better
than
it
has
found
this
universal
eternal
filial
relation
is
the
only
universal
and
eternal
refuge
it
is
the
solace
of
royalty
weeping
in
the
inner
chambers
of
its
palaces
and
of
poverty
drooping
beside
its
cold
hearth
it
is
the
glad
tidings
preached
to
the
poor
and
in
which
all
must
be
poor
in
spirit
to
have
part
if
they
be
poor
in
spirit
it
matters
little
what
is
their
external
state
or
whether
the
world
which
rolls
on
beside
or
over
them
be
the
world
of
a
solar
system
or
of
a
conquering
empire
or
of
a
village
it
now
and
then
seemed
strange
to
hope
his
wife
and
sister
now
and
then
and
for
a
passing
moment
that
while
their
hearts
were
full
of
motion
and
their
hands
occupied
with
the
vicissitudes
of
their
lot
the
little
world
around
them
which
was
wont
to
busy
itself
so
strenuously
with
their
affairs
should
work
its
yearly
round
as
if
it
heeded
them
not
as
often
as
they
detected
themselves
in
this
thought
they
smiled
at
it
for
might
not
each
neighbour
say
the
same
of
them
as
constituting
a
part
of
the
surrounding
world
there
a
cottage
where
some
engrossing
interest
did
not
defy
sympathy
where
there
was
not
some
secret
joy
some
hidden
from
every
eye
some
important
change
while
all
looked
as
familiar
as
the
thatch
and
paling
and
the
faces
which
appeared
within
them
yet
there
seemed
something
wonderful
in
the
regularity
with
which
affairs
proceeded
the
hawthorn
hedges
blossomed
and
the
corn
was
green
in
the
furrows
the
saw
of
the
carpenter
was
heard
from
day
to
day
and
the
anvil
of
the
blacksmith
rang
the
blew
his
horn
as
the
times
came
round
the
children
shouted
in
the
road
and
their
parents
bought
and
sold
planted
and
delved
ate
and
slept
as
they
had
ever
done
and
as
if
existence
were
as
mechanical
as
the
clock
which
told
the
hours
without
fail
from
the
grey
steeple
amidst
all
this
how
great
were
the
changes
in
the
in
the
early
spring
the
hearts
of
the
dwellers
in
that
house
had
been
though
far
less
dreary
than
in
the
winter
still
heavy
at
times
with
care
hester
thought
that
she
should
never
again
look
upon
the
palm
boughs
of
the
willow
swelling
with
sap
and
full
of
the
hum
of
the
early
bees
or
upon
the
bright
green
sprouts
of
the
gooseberry
in
the
cottage
gardens
or
upon
the
earliest
primrose
of
the
season
on
its
moist
bank
without
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
anxieties
of
this
first
spring
season
of
her
married
life
the
balmy
month
of
may
rich
in
its
tulips
and
lilacs
and
guelder
roses
was
sacred
to
margaret
from
the
sorrow
which
it
brought
in
the
death
of
mrs
enderby
she
wandered
under
the
hedgerows
with
philip
during
the
short
remainder
of
his
stay
and
alone
when
he
was
gone
and
grew
into
better
acquaintance
with
her
own
state
of
heart
and
mind
and
into
higher
hope
for
the
future
of
all
whom
she
loved
most
when
the
mowers
were
in
the
field
and
the
chirping
fledgelings
had
become
birds
of
the
air
and
the
days
were
at
the
longest
her
country
rambles
became
more
precious
for
they
must
henceforth
be
restricted
they
must
be
scarcer
and
shorter
in
the
place
of
the
leisure
and
solitude
for
books
in
her
own
room
and
for
meditation
in
the
field
leisure
and
solitude
which
had
been
to
this
day
more
dreamed
of
than
enjoyed
she
must
now
betake
herself
to
more
active
duty
the
maid
susan
was
discharged
at
midsummer
and
not
only
susan
after
ample
consultation
with
morris
it
was
decided
that
charles
must
go
too
his
place
being
in
part
supplied
by
a
boy
of
yet
humbler
pretensions
out
of
the
house
who
should
carry
out
the
medicines
from
the
surgery
and
do
the
errands
of
the
family
morris
spoke
cheerfully
enough
of
these
changes
smiled
as
if
amused
at
the
idea
of
her
leaving
her
young
ladies
and
did
not
doubt
but
that
if
miss
margaret
would
lend
her
a
helping
hand
sometimes
she
should
be
able
to
preserve
the
credit
of
the
family
there
was
something
more
to
be
done
than
to
lend
this
helping
hand
in
the
lighter
domestic
offices
their
midsummer
remittance
had
been
eagerly
looked
for
by
the
sisters
not
only
because
it
was
exceedingly
wanted
for
the
current
expenses
of
the
household
but
because
it
was
high
time
that
preparations
were
begun
for
the
great
event
of
the
autumn
the
birth
of
hester
little
one
during
this
summer
margaret
was
up
early
and
was
busy
as
morris
herself
about
the
house
till
breakfast
and
for
some
time
after
hope
had
gone
forth
on
his
daily
round
now
so
small
that
he
soon
returned
to
his
books
and
his
pen
in
the
study
the
morning
hours
passed
pleasantly
away
while
hester
and
margaret
sat
at
work
by
the
window
which
looked
into
their
garden
now
by
sydney
care
trimmed
up
into
a
state
of
promise
once
more
hester
was
so
much
happier
so
reasonable
so
brave
amidst
her
sinking
fortunes
that
margaret
could
scarcely
have
been
gayer
than
in
plying
her
needle
by
her
side
their
cares
lay
chiefly
out
of
doors
now
the
villagers
behaved
rudely
to
edward
and
cherished
mr
walcot
mrs
rowland
took
every
opportunity
of
insulting
margaret
and
throwing
discredit
on
her
engagement
and
the
greys
caused
their
cousins
much
uneasiness
by
the
spirit
in
which
they
conducted
their
share
of
the
great
controversy
of
the
place
these
troubles
awaited
the
family
abroad
but
their
peace
was
perpetually
on
the
increase
at
home
morris
and
they
were
so
completely
in
one
interest
edward
was
so
easily
pleased
and
they
were
so
free
from
jealous
dependants
that
they
could
carry
their
economy
to
any
extent
that
suited
their
conscience
and
convenience
one
superfluity
after
another
vanished
from
the
table
every
day
something
which
had
always
been
a
want
was
discovered
to
be
a
fancy
and
with
every
new
act
of
frugality
each
fresh
exertion
of
industry
their
spirits
rose
with
a
sense
of
achievement
and
the
complacency
proper
to
cheerful
sacrifice
in
the
evenings
of
their
busy
days
the
sisters
went
out
with
edward
into
their
garden
or
into
the
meadows
or
spent
an
hour
in
the
greys
pretty
shrubbery
maria
often
saw
them
thus
and
thought
how
happy
are
they
who
can
ramble
abroad
and
find
their
cares
dispersed
by
the
breeze
or
dissolved
in
the
sunshine
of
the
fields
the
little
rowlands
sometimes
met
them
in
the
lanes
and
the
younger
ones
would
thrust
upon
them
the
wild
flowers
which
mr
walcot
had
helped
them
to
gather
while
mrs
rowland
and
matilda
would
draw
down
their
black
crape
veils
and
walk
on
with
scarcely
a
passing
salutation
every
such
meeting
with
the
lady
every
civil
bow
from
mr
walcot
every
tale
which
mrs
grey
and
sophia
had
to
tell
against
the
new
surgeon
seemed
to
do
hester
good
and
make
her
happier
these
things
were
appeals
to
her
magnanimity
and
she
could
bear
for
sake
many
a
trial
which
she
could
not
otherwise
have
endured
all
this
told
upon
the
intercourse
at
home
and
morris
heart
was
often
cheered
as
she
pursued
her
labours
in
kitchen
or
chamber
with
the
sound
of
such
merry
laughter
as
had
seldom
been
heard
in
the
family
during
the
anxious
winter
that
had
gone
by
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
depressed
her
young
ladies
now
there
was
frequent
intelligence
of
the
going
over
of
another
patient
to
mr
walcot
the
summer
was
not
a
favourable
one
and
everybody
else
was
complaining
of
unseasonable
weather
of
the
certainty
of
storms
in
the
autumn
of
blight
and
the
prospect
of
scarcity
yet
though
mr
grey
shook
his
head
and
the
parish
clerk
could
never
be
seen
but
with
a
doleful
prophecy
in
his
mouth
morris
young
master
and
mistresses
were
gay
as
she
could
desire
she
was
piously
thankful
for
margaret
engagement
for
she
concluded
that
it
was
by
means
of
this
that
other
hearts
were
working
round
into
their
true
relation
and
into
a
peace
which
the
world
with
all
its
wealth
and
favours
can
neither
make
nor
mar
in
one
of
margaret
hedgerow
rambles
with
philip
a
few
days
after
his
mother
funeral
she
had
been
strongly
urged
to
leave
deerbrook
and
its
troubles
behind
her
to
marry
at
once
and
be
free
from
the
trials
from
which
he
could
not
protect
her
if
she
remained
in
the
same
place
with
mrs
rowland
but
margaret
steadily
refused
you
will
be
wretched
said
philip
you
will
be
wretched
i
know
you
will
the
moment
i
am
gone
i
never
was
less
likely
to
be
wretched
mrs
rowland
can
not
make
me
so
and
other
people
will
not
i
have
every
expectation
of
a
happy
summer
which
i
mention
for
your
sake
for
i
do
not
like
to
indulge
in
that
sort
of
anticipation
without
some
such
good
reason
as
comforting
you
you
can
not
be
happy
here
priscilla
will
never
let
you
have
an
easy
day
while
she
fancies
she
can
separate
us
when
i
think
of
the
pertinacity
with
which
she
disowns
you
the
scorn
with
which
she
speaks
about
you
even
in
my
presence
i
see
that
nothing
will
do
but
your
being
mine
at
once
that
would
not
mend
the
matter
our
haste
and
imprudence
would
go
to
countenance
the
scandal
she
spreads
why
can
not
we
rather
live
it
down
because
your
spirit
will
be
broken
in
the
mean
time
margaret
i
must
be
your
guardian
this
is
my
first
duty
and
an
absolute
necessity
if
you
will
not
go
with
me
i
will
not
leave
this
place
and
if
my
plan
of
life
is
broken
up
you
will
be
answerable
for
it
it
was
your
plan
and
you
may
demolish
it
if
you
choose
i
have
a
plan
of
life
too
said
margaret
it
is
to
do
the
duty
that
lies
nearest
at
hand
and
the
duty
that
lies
nearest
at
hand
is
to
keep
you
up
to
yours
after
this
there
is
one
which
lies
almost
as
close
i
can
not
leave
hester
and
edward
till
this
crisis
in
their
fortunes
is
past
i
am
bound
to
them
for
the
present
what
are
their
claims
to
mine
nothing
if
they
were
fortunate
as
i
trust
they
yet
may
be
nothing
if
you
had
followed
your
plan
of
life
up
to
the
point
when
we
may
carry
it
out
together
we
are
wrong
philip
in
even
thinking
of
what
you
say
you
must
go
and
study
law
and
you
must
go
without
me
indeed
i
could
not
be
happy
to
join
you
yet
your
good
name
would
suffer
from
what
mrs
rowland
might
then
say
your
future
prospects
would
suffer
from
the
interruption
of
your
preparation
for
your
profession
i
should
feel
that
i
had
injured
you
and
deserted
my
own
duty
indeed
philip
i
could
not
be
happy
and
how
happy
do
you
imagine
we
shall
be
apart
margaret
gave
him
a
look
which
said
what
words
could
not
what
it
was
to
be
assured
of
his
love
what
it
seemed
to
ask
could
all
the
evil
tongues
in
the
world
do
to
poison
this
joy
besides
said
she
i
have
the
idea
that
i
could
not
be
spared
and
there
is
great
pleasure
in
that
vanity
edward
and
hester
can
not
do
without
me
at
present
you
may
say
so
at
any
future
time
no
when
the
right
time
comes
they
will
not
want
me
oh
philip
you
are
grieved
for
them
and
you
long
to
see
them
prosperous
do
not
tempt
me
to
desert
them
now
they
want
my
help
they
want
the
little
money
i
have
they
want
my
hands
and
head
let
this
be
your
share
of
the
penalty
mrs
rowland
imposes
upon
us
all
to
spare
me
to
them
while
their
adversity
lasts
i
would
not
be
selfish
margaret
i
would
not
trespass
upon
your
wishes
and
your
duty
but
the
truth
is
i
sometimes
fear
that
i
may
have
some
heavier
penalty
even
than
this
to
pay
for
priscilla
temper
ah
you
wonder
what
can
be
heavier
remember
she
has
put
misunderstanding
between
us
before
but
she
never
can
again
ours
was
then
merely
a
tacit
understanding
now
supposing
me
ever
to
hear
what
she
may
hint
or
say
do
you
imagine
i
should
give
the
slightest
heed
to
it
i
would
not
believe
her
news
of
a
person
i
had
never
seen
and
do
you
think
she
can
make
the
slightest
impression
on
me
with
regard
to
you
it
seems
unreasonable
at
this
moment
but
yet
i
have
a
superstitious
dread
of
the
power
of
spirits
of
evil
superstitious
indeed
i
defy
them
all
now
that
we
have
once
understood
each
other
if
she
were
able
to
do
far
more
than
she
can
if
she
could
load
the
winds
with
accusations
against
you
if
she
could
haunt
my
dreams
and
raise
you
up
in
visions
mocking
at
me
i
believe
she
could
not
move
me
now
before
i
blamed
myself
i
thought
i
was
lost
in
vanity
and
error
now
that
i
have
once
had
certainty
we
are
safe
you
are
right
i
trust
i
believe
it
but
there
is
a
long
hard
battle
to
be
fought
yet
it
fills
me
with
shame
to
think
how
she
treats
you
in
every
relation
you
have
she
is
cruel
to
maria
young
she
hopes
to
reach
you
through
her
ah
you
will
hear
nothing
of
it
from
maria
i
dare
say
but
she
spoke
infamously
to
her
this
morning
before
mrs
levitt
mrs
levitt
happened
to
be
sitting
with
maria
when
priscilla
and
one
or
two
of
the
children
went
in
mrs
levitt
spoke
of
us
priscilla
denied
our
engagement
maria
asserted
it
very
gently
but
quite
decidedly
priscilla
reminded
her
of
her
poverty
and
infirmities
spoke
of
the
gratitude
she
owed
to
those
from
whom
she
derived
her
subsistence
and
reproached
her
with
having
purposes
of
her
own
to
answer
in
making
matches
in
the
families
of
her
employers
and
maria
maria
trembled
excessively
the
children
say
weak
and
reduced
by
pain
as
she
is
one
can
hardly
conceive
of
temper
carrying
any
woman
into
such
cruelty
mrs
levitt
rose
in
great
concern
and
displeasure
to
go
but
maria
begged
her
to
sit
down
again
sent
one
of
the
children
for
me
and
appealed
to
me
to
declare
what
share
she
had
had
in
my
engagement
with
you
i
set
her
right
with
mrs
levitt
who
i
am
convinced
sees
how
the
matter
stands
but
it
was
really
a
distressing
scene
and
before
the
children
too
that
was
the
worst
part
of
it
they
stood
looking
from
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
in
utter
dismay
it
would
have
moved
any
one
but
priscilla
to
see
the
torrent
of
tears
maria
shed
over
them
when
they
came
timidly
to
wish
her
good
morning
after
mrs
levitt
was
gone
she
said
she
could
do
nothing
more
for
them
they
had
been
taught
to
despise
her
and
her
relation
to
them
was
at
an
end
it
is
it
must
be
exclaimed
margaret
is
there
no
way
of
stopping
a
career
of
vice
like
this
while
mrs
plumstead
gets
a
parish
boy
whipped
for
picking
up
her
hens
eggs
from
among
the
nettles
is
maria
to
have
no
redress
for
slander
which
takes
away
her
peace
and
her
bread
she
shall
have
redress
for
the
children
sake
as
well
as
her
own
her
connection
with
them
must
go
on
i
do
not
exactly
see
how
but
the
thing
must
be
done
i
dread
speaking
to
poor
rowland
about
any
of
these
things
i
know
it
makes
him
so
wretched
but
the
good
and
the
innocent
must
not
be
sacrificed
if
these
poor
children
must
despise
somebody
their
contempt
must
be
made
to
fall
in
the
right
place
even
though
it
be
upon
their
mother
let
us
go
and
see
maria
said
margaret
turning
back
if
there
is
a
just
and
merciful
way
of
proceeding
in
this
case
she
will
point
it
out
i
wish
you
had
told
me
all
this
before
here
have
we
been
rambling
over
the
grass
and
among
the
where
at
the
best
maria
can
never
go
and
she
lies
weeping
all
alone
looking
for
me
i
dare
say
every
moment
let
us
make
haste
philip
made
all
the
haste
that
was
compatible
with
gathering
a
handful
of
wild
hyacinth
and
meadow
narcissus
for
poor
maria
he
found
himself
farther
from
success
than
ever
when
he
would
have
again
urged
margaret
to
marry
at
once
a
new
duty
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
to
keep
her
at
deerbrook
maria
wanted
her
her
summer
work
lay
clear
before
her
she
must
nurse
and
cheer
maria
she
must
ply
her
needle
for
hester
and
play
the
housewife
spending
many
of
her
hours
in
the
business
of
living
a
business
which
is
often
supposed
to
transact
itself
but
which
in
reality
requires
all
the
faculties
which
can
be
brought
to
it
and
all
the
good
moral
habits
which
conscience
can
originate
the
most
that
philip
could
obtain
was
permission
to
come
when
his
duties
would
fairly
allow
it
and
a
promise
that
he
should
be
summoned
if
margaret
found
herself
placed
in
any
difficulty
by
mrs
rowland
maria
was
not
now
literally
alone
nor
did
she
depend
on
her
hostess
or
on
margaret
for
nursing
and
companionship
it
occurred
to
all
the
kindest
of
her
friends
immediately
after
mrs
enderby
death
that
phoebe
might
be
her
attendant
phoebe
was
not
just
then
the
most
cheerful
of
nurses
so
truly
did
she
mourn
her
good
old
mistress
but
she
was
glad
of
occupation
glad
to
be
out
of
mrs
rowland
way
glad
to
be
useful
and
she
was
an
inestimable
comfort
to
maria
nothing
could
be
done
about
placing
the
children
again
under
care
when
she
had
recovered
mr
rowland
was
naturally
unwilling
to
stir
in
the
business
and
saw
that
the
best
chance
for
his
children
was
to
send
them
to
school
at
a
distance
from
deerbrook
and
maria
had
been
too
grossly
insulted
in
the
presence
of
her
pupils
to
choose
to
resume
her
authority
the
greys
took
her
up
with
double
zeal
as
the
rowlands
let
her
down
they
assured
her
that
her
little
income
should
not
suffer
for
her
being
able
to
devote
all
her
time
to
fanny
and
mary
the
money
indeed
was
nothing
to
mrs
grey
in
comparison
with
the
pleasure
it
procured
her
it
put
her
upon
equal
terms
with
mrs
rowland
at
last
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
patronise
mr
hope
he
always
contrived
to
baffle
her
praise
but
here
was
an
unconnected
person
thrown
upon
her
care
and
if
mrs
rowland
had
a
young
surgeon
to
push
mrs
grey
had
an
incomparable
governess
now
all
to
herself
chapter
thirty
four
old
and
young
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
summer
at
deerbrook
was
the
rival
parties
of
pleasure
with
which
the
village
was
entertained
there
had
been
rival
parties
of
pleasure
the
preceding
year
but
from
what
a
different
cause
then
all
were
anxious
to
do
honour
to
hester
and
margaret
or
to
show
off
in
their
eyes
now
the
efforts
made
were
on
the
one
hand
to
mortify
and
on
the
other
to
sustain
them
the
rowlands
had
a
carriage
party
to
the
woods
one
week
and
the
greys
a
cavalcade
to
the
at
blickley
the
next
the
rowlands
gave
a
dinner
to
introduce
mr
walcot
to
more
and
more
of
their
country
neighbours
and
the
greys
had
a
dance
in
the
green
walk
for
the
young
people
of
the
village
the
rowlands
went
to
a
strawberry
gathering
at
sir
william
hunter
and
the
greys
with
all
their
faction
as
mrs
rowland
called
it
were
invited
to
a
syllabub
under
the
cow
at
the
miss
andersons
for
the
holidays
all
pretence
of
a
good
understanding
between
the
two
families
was
now
at
an
end
they
ceased
to
invite
each
other
and
scrambled
for
their
mutual
acquaintances
the
best
of
their
mutual
acquaintances
saw
no
reason
for
taking
part
in
the
quarrel
and
preserved
a
strict
neutrality
and
the
worst
enjoyed
being
scrambled
for
the
levitts
visited
both
families
and
entertained
everybody
in
return
as
if
nothing
was
happening
sir
william
and
lady
hunter
ate
their
annual
dinner
with
each
and
condescended
to
pay
two
or
three
extra
visits
to
mrs
rowland
without
making
a
point
of
a
full
moon
every
circumstance
that
happened
afforded
occasion
for
comment
of
course
mrs
grey
thought
it
very
improper
in
the
rowlands
to
indulge
in
all
this
gaiety
while
they
were
in
deep
mourning
it
was
painful
to
her
feelings
she
owned
to
hear
the
children
shouting
with
laughter
while
they
were
all
bombazine
and
crape
from
head
to
foot
she
had
hoped
to
see
the
memory
of
her
dear
old
friend
treated
with
more
respect
in
vain
did
mr
hope
plead
mrs
enderby
delight
in
the
mirth
of
children
and
that
their
innocent
gaiety
would
cheer
her
in
her
grave
if
it
could
reach
her
there
in
vain
did
hester
urge
the
danger
and
sin
of
training
the
little
creatures
to
hypocrisy
a
probable
result
if
they
were
to
be
kept
solemn
and
unamused
to
the
day
when
they
might
put
off
their
mourning
mrs
grey
felt
herself
only
the
more
called
upon
by
all
this
to
furnish
the
amount
of
sighs
and
tears
which
she
believed
to
be
due
to
mrs
enderby
memory
margaret
rather
sided
with
her
it
was
so
sweet
to
her
to
hear
philip
mother
mourned
mrs
grey
tears
were
however
interspersed
with
smiles
on
the
day
of
the
rowlands
great
when
all
was
to
be
so
stately
for
the
hunters
when
the
new
dessert
service
was
procured
from
staffordshire
the
fish
had
not
arrived
from
london
this
was
certainly
a
fact
the
fish
had
come
by
the
coach
the
next
morning
and
what
was
still
more
remarkable
it
had
not
occurred
to
mrs
rowland
that
such
an
accident
might
happen
was
very
likely
to
happen
and
as
if
she
had
been
an
inexperienced
housekeeper
she
had
not
any
dish
in
reserve
in
case
of
the
of
the
fish
it
was
said
that
mrs
rowland
had
sat
down
to
table
with
a
face
perfectly
crimson
with
anxiety
and
vexation
to
such
a
temper
as
hers
what
a
vexation
it
must
have
been
there
was
a
counterpart
to
this
story
for
mrs
rowland
she
fancied
that
mrs
grey
friends
the
andersons
must
have
looked
rather
foolish
on
occasion
of
their
great
syllabub
party
she
hoped
the
miss
andersons
trained
their
pupils
better
than
their
cows
they
had
a
sad
obstreperous
cow
she
understood
some
of
the
young
ladies
had
lured
it
up
the
lawn
with
a
potato
and
got
it
to
stand
still
to
be
milked
but
when
somebody
began
to
sing
she
had
no
doubt
it
was
miss
ibbotson
who
sang
the
poor
animal
found
the
music
was
not
to
its
taste
and
of
course
it
kicked
away
the
china
bowl
and
pranced
down
the
lawn
again
there
was
a
dirge
sung
over
the
syllabub
no
doubt
the
poor
miss
andersons
must
have
been
terribly
annoyed
the
good
understanding
of
the
gentlemen
seemed
all
this
time
to
be
uninterrupted
they
had
much
to
put
up
with
at
home
on
this
account
but
their
towards
each
other
remained
unbroken
mr
rowland
anxious
face
and
his
retirement
within
the
enclosure
of
his
own
business
told
his
neighbours
something
of
what
he
had
to
go
through
at
home
mrs
grey
was
vexed
with
her
husband
that
he
did
not
visit
hope
misfortunes
upon
mr
rowland
and
call
the
husband
to
account
for
the
mischief
the
wife
had
caused
and
hester
more
than
once
expressed
some
resentment
against
her
relation
for
not
espousing
edward
cause
more
warmly
hope
told
her
this
was
not
reasonable
remember
said
he
as
they
sauntered
in
their
garden
one
evening
that
these
gentlemen
must
be
more
weary
than
we
are
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
of
these
perpetual
squabbles
and
they
must
earnestly
desire
to
have
peace
in
the
god
forbid
that
their
dominions
should
be
invaded
for
our
sake
not
for
our
sake
only
but
for
the
sake
of
justice
everything
depends
on
the
sort
of
men
you
have
to
deal
with
in
such
cases
as
this
you
must
not
expect
too
much
here
are
two
men
bound
to
each
other
by
mutual
good
will
and
mutual
interest
there
is
no
other
resemblance
between
them
except
that
they
are
both
overpowered
made
rather
cowardly
by
the
circumstances
of
their
environment
once
departing
from
their
plan
of
keeping
the
peace
they
would
be
plunged
into
quarrel
they
view
things
so
differently
from
the
differences
of
their
minds
that
their
only
safety
is
in
avoiding
altogether
all
subjects
of
deerbrook
contention
if
you
expect
the
heroism
of
devoted
friendship
or
of
an
enthusiastic
sense
of
justice
from
such
men
you
will
not
find
it
we
must
take
them
as
they
are
and
humbly
accept
such
countenance
as
they
choose
to
bestow
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
will
there
is
no
use
in
quarrelling
with
them
for
not
being
what
they
are
not
that
is
all
be
generous
with
them
and
do
not
expect
from
them
the
conduct
which
they
have
a
right
to
expect
from
you
i
rather
wonder
observed
margaret
that
they
have
had
the
courage
to
go
so
far
as
they
do
in
bearing
testimony
in
your
favour
they
have
been
very
handsome
in
their
conduct
on
the
whole
and
it
would
grieve
me
sincerely
if
they
were
to
suffer
further
than
they
have
already
done
on
my
account
i
am
afraid
mr
rowland
is
wretched
now
because
i
will
accept
no
assistance
from
him
he
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
should
receive
no
rent
for
this
house
while
walcot
occupies
the
other
he
was
beyond
measure
mortified
when
i
positively
declined
being
under
any
such
obligation
to
any
landlord
if
mr
rowland
steadily
refuses
to
turn
us
out
of
our
house
and
goes
on
offering
favours
that
i
can
not
accept
that
is
all
we
can
expect
from
him
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
he
can
turn
us
out
said
hester
that
we
are
tenants
at
will
oh
how
sorry
i
should
be
to
go
she
continued
as
she
surveyed
the
place
i
should
grieve
to
quit
our
first
home
there
is
no
danger
i
believe
mr
rowland
will
be
firm
on
that
head
and
there
is
no
danger
i
should
think
said
margaret
but
that
the
greys
would
find
us
something
better
the
next
day
oh
i
do
not
know
where
or
how
but
it
would
be
such
a
splendid
opportunity
for
patronage
that
they
would
work
miracles
rather
than
let
it
slip
how
far
this
ivy
has
trailed
over
the
wall
already
i
should
be
sorry
to
leave
this
garden
now
that
it
promises
to
look
like
itself
so
soon
again
sydney
despises
me
for
my
admiration
of
it
at
present
he
looks
melancholy
about
the
blight
it
is
a
pity
certainly
look
at
this
how
curled
and
withered
it
is
sydney
is
doing
like
every
one
else
in
looking
grave
about
the
blight
observed
hope
so
bad
a
season
has
not
been
known
since
i
came
to
deerbrook
i
see
care
in
the
face
of
many
an
one
who
does
not
stand
anything
like
our
chance
of
want
here
comes
sydney
with
news
of
every
field
for
five
miles
round
i
doubt
not
and
mr
and
mrs
grey
and
sophia
said
hester
quitting
her
arm
and
hastening
to
meet
her
friends
the
greys
pronounced
it
so
pleasant
an
evening
that
they
had
no
wish
to
sit
down
within
doors
they
preferred
walking
in
the
garden
they
seemed
to
come
for
two
purposes
to
offer
an
invitation
and
to
relate
that
mr
walcot
was
gone
to
dine
at
sir
william
hunter
and
that
sir
william
had
sent
the
carriage
for
him
mr
walcot
had
not
been
ready
for
full
five
minutes
after
the
carriage
had
driven
up
to
the
door
this
delay
was
no
doubt
intended
to
give
all
deerbrook
time
to
observe
the
peculiar
consideration
with
which
mr
walcot
was
treated
by
sir
william
and
lady
hunter
who
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
of
sending
their
carriage
for
their
deerbrook
guests
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
said
sophia
as
sending
a
carriage
for
a
young
man
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
because
he
can
not
ride
there
you
are
out
sophy
cried
sydney
mr
walcot
rides
as
well
as
mr
hope
every
bit
i
can
not
think
what
has
happened
to
sydney
observed
his
mother
he
does
nothing
but
stand
up
for
mr
walcot
in
the
most
unaccountable
way
i
hope
you
will
forgive
it
mr
hope
boys
take
strange
fancies
you
know
you
must
forgive
it
my
dears
in
consideration
of
the
rest
of
us
instead
of
forgiving
it
said
hope
i
shall
take
leave
rather
to
admire
it
there
is
a
fine
chivalrous
spirit
shown
in
fighting
mr
walcot
battles
with
our
friends
and
relations
there
now
cried
sydney
triumphantly
but
i
ca
help
it
you
see
mr
walcot
can
ride
and
he
does
ride
well
and
he
is
very
civil
to
me
and
asks
me
to
go
fishing
with
him
and
i
am
sure
he
always
inquires
very
respectfully
after
the
rest
of
them
i
never
said
any
more
than
that
in
praise
of
him
and
i
ca
say
less
can
i
when
they
are
all
abusing
him
for
whatever
he
does
i
think
not
i
believe
we
may
spare
him
that
much
credit
without
grudging
but
sydney
you
know
it
is
not
pleasant
to
us
to
hear
you
speak
in
praise
of
mr
walcot
under
present
circumstances
and
you
should
have
a
little
consideration
for
us
well
mother
if
you
will
not
speak
of
him
at
all
no
more
will
i
and
he
glanced
up
into
his
mother
face
to
see
how
the
proposition
was
taken
that
is
fair
is
not
it
he
inquired
of
mr
hope
excellent
in
theory
sydney
but
who
likes
to
be
tied
down
not
to
speak
on
any
subject
especially
one
which
is
turning
up
every
hour
your
plan
will
not
answer
i
will
ask
you
because
i
said
i
would
and
all
the
more
because
you
are
not
cross
about
mr
walcot
hold
your
tongue
sydney
said
the
mother
do
not
be
ridiculous
sydney
advised
the
sister
mr
hope
will
say
whether
it
is
ridiculous
sophy
now
mr
hope
would
not
you
and
cousin
hester
and
margaret
go
down
the
water
with
us
to
the
abbey
just
the
same
if
mr
walcot
was
with
us
with
any
guest
of
your
father
and
mother
sydney
we
have
no
quarrel
with
mr
walcot
the
truth
is
we
feel
after
all
we
have
heard
that
we
know
very
little
about
him
we
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
meet
mr
walcot
neither
wish
nor
objection
said
hester
calmly
we
are
perfectly
indifferent
about
him
sydney
vehemently
beckoned
his
father
who
left
the
apricot
he
and
margaret
were
examining
by
the
surgery
wall
and
came
to
see
what
he
was
wanted
for
you
see
said
he
to
hope
when
the
matter
was
explained
i
have
naturally
been
rather
anxious
to
bring
this
about
this
meeting
between
you
and
the
young
man
in
a
small
place
like
this
it
is
painful
to
have
everybody
quarrelling
and
not
to
be
able
to
get
one
friends
about
one
for
fear
they
should
brawl
in
one
very
mr
rowland
is
of
my
mind
there
and
i
know
it
would
gratify
him
if
i
were
to
take
some
notice
of
this
young
man
i
really
could
hardly
refuse
knowing
how
handsomely
mr
rowland
always
speaks
of
you
and
yours
and
believing
mr
walcot
to
be
a
very
respectable
harmless
young
man
if
i
thought
it
would
injure
your
interests
in
the
least
i
would
see
him
at
cape
horn
before
i
would
invite
him
of
course
you
must
be
aware
of
that
and
i
should
not
think
of
asking
you
to
meet
mrs
rowland
that
would
be
going
too
far
but
mrs
grey
wishes
that
your
wife
and
margaret
should
visit
these
ruins
that
we
were
always
prevented
from
getting
to
last
year
and
mr
walcot
is
anxious
to
see
them
too
and
he
has
been
civil
to
sydney
and
in
short
i
believe
that
sydney
half
promised
that
he
should
go
with
us
say
no
more
replied
hope
you
will
have
no
difficulty
with
us
i
really
know
nothing
against
mr
walcot
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
settle
where
he
pleased
whether
the
manner
of
doing
it
was
handsome
or
otherwise
is
of
far
more
consequence
to
himself
than
to
me
or
to
any
one
else
i
wish
we
all
viewed
the
matter
as
you
do
if
the
ladies
had
your
temper
we
should
have
a
heaven
upon
earth
but
they
take
things
up
so
warmly
you
see
when
their
feelings
are
interested
for
anybody
mrs
rowland
for
one
and
my
wife
for
another
i
hardly
know
what
she
will
say
to
the
idea
of
our
having
walcot
with
us
let
us
go
and
see
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
first
do
you
know
of
any
one
who
wants
a
horse
i
am
going
to
dispose
of
mine
mr
walcot
wants
a
horse
said
sydney
delighted
at
the
idea
of
solving
a
difficulty
hope
smiled
and
told
mr
grey
that
he
had
rather
sell
his
horse
at
a
distance
mr
walcot
had
already
hired
the
boy
charles
whom
hope
had
just
dismissed
and
if
he
obtained
the
horse
too
the
old
servant
who
knew
his
way
to
every
patient
door
all
the
country
round
it
really
would
look
too
like
the
unpopular
man
patronising
his
opponent
besides
it
would
be
needlessly
publishing
in
deerbrook
that
the
horse
was
given
up
what
is
the
fault
of
your
horse
asked
mr
grey
rousing
himself
from
an
absent
fit
merely
that
he
eats
and
therefore
is
expensive
i
can
not
afford
now
to
keep
a
horse
he
declared
in
answer
to
mr
grey
stare
of
amazement
i
have
so
few
patients
now
out
of
walking
reach
that
i
have
no
right
to
keep
a
horse
i
can
always
hire
you
know
from
reeves
upon
my
soul
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
extremely
sorry
to
hear
it
matters
must
have
gone
further
than
i
had
any
idea
of
my
dear
fellow
we
must
see
how
we
can
serve
you
you
must
let
me
accommodate
you
indeed
you
must
rather
than
give
up
your
horse
do
not
speak
of
it
you
are
very
kind
but
we
need
no
help
i
do
assure
you
my
mind
is
quite
made
up
about
the
horse
it
would
only
be
an
incumbrance
now
and
to
satisfy
you
i
will
mention
that
i
have
declined
repeated
offers
of
accommodation
offers
very
strongly
urged
all
i
need
ask
of
you
is
to
help
me
to
dispose
of
my
horse
somewhere
out
of
deerbrook
i
will
manage
that
for
you
the
next
time
i
go
to
market
and
in
the
emotion
of
the
moment
mr
grey
was
on
the
point
of
offering
the
use
of
his
own
horse
when
it
should
be
at
home
but
he
stopped
short
on
the
verge
of
his
rash
generosity
he
was
very
particular
about
no
one
riding
his
horse
but
himself
and
the
man
who
groomed
it
he
remembered
his
friend
hope
rapid
riding
and
and
suspected
that
he
should
sooner
or
later
repent
the
offer
so
he
changed
it
into
i
will
get
your
horse
disposed
of
to
the
best
advantage
you
may
depend
upon
it
but
i
am
very
sorry
very
sorry
indeed
it
is
probable
that
nothing
could
have
reconciled
the
ladies
of
mr
grey
family
to
the
idea
of
admitting
mr
walcot
into
their
party
but
the
fact
that
they
had
of
late
cut
rather
a
poor
figure
in
contrast
to
mrs
rowland
that
lady
had
the
advantage
of
novelty
in
the
person
of
mr
walcot
and
her
was
by
far
the
larger
of
the
two
the
greys
found
fault
with
all
its
elements
but
there
was
no
denying
its
superiority
of
numbers
it
was
a
great
hardship
to
have
mr
walcot
forced
upon
them
but
they
reflected
that
his
presence
might
bring
a
reinforcement
that
some
neighbours
would
perhaps
come
to
meet
him
who
would
be
otherwise
engaged
to
the
rowlands
for
the
very
day
on
which
they
were
wanted
for
mrs
rowland
had
the
art
of
just
the
people
the
greys
intended
to
have
sophia
observed
that
mr
presence
would
be
less
of
a
restraint
in
a
boat
and
at
tea
among
the
ruins
than
in
the
there
was
always
something
to
be
said
about
the
banks
and
the
woods
and
there
was
singing
and
in
a
boat
people
were
not
obliged
to
talk
unless
they
liked
she
should
not
wonder
if
he
would
rather
relish
a
little
neglect
he
had
been
made
much
of
lately
at
such
a
ridiculous
rate
if
we
do
our
part
my
love
said
mrs
grey
to
hester
in
a
mysterious
low
voice
i
think
you
should
exert
yourselves
a
little
nothing
can
be
done
without
a
little
exertion
in
this
world
you
know
sophia
and
i
were
agreeing
that
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
had
any
of
your
friends
about
you
very
few
since
your
wedding
company
observed
sophia
we
remember
you
had
all
your
acquaintance
in
the
winter
my
dear
it
was
very
proper
i
am
sure
all
you
did
then
but
it
is
now
the
middle
of
july
you
know
and
our
neighbours
if
deerbrook
always
expect
to
be
invited
twice
a
year
i
should
be
happy
to
see
them
i
assure
you
said
hester
but
it
happens
to
be
not
convenient
not
convenient
my
dear
just
so
we
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
and
yours
but
we
have
no
hospitality
to
spare
for
the
common
world
just
now
we
have
no
servants
you
know
but
morris
and
we
are
spending
as
little
as
we
can
tea
company
costs
so
very
little
said
sophia
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
you
need
not
light
candles
till
people
are
going
away
and
when
fruit
is
cheap
and
plentiful
and
we
will
take
care
of
the
cake
interposed
mrs
grey
sophia
will
make
you
some
of
her
and
a
batch
of
almond
biscuits
and
alice
shall
come
and
wait
we
can
manage
it
very
easily
you
are
extremely
kind
but
if
our
acquaintance
are
to
eat
your
cake
it
had
better
be
at
your
house
it
does
not
suit
our
present
circumstances
to
entertain
company
but
it
costs
so
very
little
persisted
sophia
mr
russell
father
used
to
give
a
general
invitation
to
all
his
friends
to
come
to
tea
in
the
summer
because
as
he
said
they
then
cost
him
only
i
am
afraid
we
are
not
such
good
managers
as
mr
russell
father
replied
hester
laughing
and
if
we
were
it
is
not
convenient
to
spend
even
upon
our
common
acquaintance
at
present
if
we
grow
richer
we
will
get
our
friends
about
us
without
counting
the
cost
so
closely
as
that
that
time
will
soon
come
sophia
my
dear
said
her
mother
winking
at
hester
in
every
profession
you
know
there
are
little
ups
and
downs
and
particularly
in
the
medical
i
dare
say
if
the
truth
were
told
there
is
scarcely
any
professional
man
without
private
fortune
who
has
not
at
some
time
of
his
life
broken
into
his
last
guinea
without
knowing
where
he
is
to
get
another
but
professional
people
generally
keep
their
difficulties
to
themselves
i
fancy
hester
they
are
not
often
so
frank
as
you
mind
that
sophia
you
will
be
discreet
sophia
we
have
no
intention
of
proclaiming
in
the
streets
that
we
are
poor
said
hester
but
we
owe
it
to
you
dear
mrs
grey
to
give
our
reasons
for
not
doing
all
that
we
and
you
might
wish
we
are
not
dissatisfied
we
want
no
help
or
pity
but
we
must
live
as
we
think
right
that
is
all
indeed
my
dear
i
must
say
you
do
not
look
as
if
anything
was
amiss
you
look
charmingly
indeed
charmingly
indeed
echoed
sophia
and
mrs
levitt
was
saying
that
margaret
seems
to
have
grown
quite
handsome
this
summer
i
fancy
mrs
rowland
gets
very
few
to
agree
with
her
as
to
margaret
being
so
very
plain
no
indeed
margaret
countenance
is
so
intelligent
and
pleasant
that
i
always
said
from
the
beginning
that
nobody
but
mrs
rowland
could
call
her
plain
i
suppose
we
shall
soon
be
losing
her
hester
oh
no
not
soon
she
has
no
thought
of
leaving
us
at
present
she
would
not
go
in
the
spring
and
sit
beside
philip
while
he
was
learning
his
lessons
and
now
they
will
wait
i
believe
till
the
lessons
are
finished
she
would
not
well
that
shows
what
love
will
do
that
shows
what
her
power
over
mr
enderby
is
we
used
to
think
indeed
everybody
used
to
say
it
of
mr
enderby
that
he
always
managed
to
do
as
he
liked
he
carried
all
his
points
yet
even
he
is
obliged
to
yield
margaret
has
a
way
of
carrying
her
points
too
said
hester
the
best
way
in
the
world
by
being
always
right
mind
that
sophia
but
my
dear
hester
i
am
really
anxious
about
you
i
had
no
idea
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
get
your
natural
rest
perfectly
i
assure
you
mrs
howell
might
envy
me
if
she
still
can
not
sleep
for
matching
of
worsteds
the
simple
truth
is
mrs
grey
we
never
were
so
happy
in
our
lives
this
may
seem
rather
perverse
but
so
it
is
mrs
grey
sighed
that
mrs
rowland
could
not
be
aware
of
this
hester
thought
it
was
no
business
of
mrs
rowland
but
mrs
grey
could
not
but
feel
that
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
that
she
should
know
that
those
whom
she
hated
slept
she
heard
margaret
and
sydney
saying
something
in
the
middle
of
the
about
the
milky
way
looking
up
she
was
surprised
to
perceive
how
plain
it
was
and
how
many
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
sky
she
was
sure
hester
must
be
dreadfully
tired
with
sauntering
about
so
long
they
had
been
very
inconsiderate
and
must
go
away
directly
sydney
must
call
his
father
they
are
delightful
young
people
really
observed
mrs
grey
to
her
husband
during
their
walk
home
one
never
knows
how
to
get
away
lady
hunter
little
supposes
what
she
loses
in
not
cultivating
them
go
on
before
us
sophia
make
haste
home
with
your
sister
sydney
but
my
dear
they
speak
in
a
very
poor
way
of
their
affairs
oh
hester
spoke
to
you
did
she
hope
told
me
he
must
part
with
his
horse
so
hester
spoke
to
you
yes
not
at
all
in
a
melancholy
way
however
she
keeps
up
her
spirits
wonderfully
poor
girl
we
really
must
push
them
mr
grey
i
see
nothing
but
ruin
before
them
if
we
do
not
push
them
ah
there
is
the
difficulty
that
is
where
that
little
enthusiasm
of
hope
comes
in
i
have
a
great
respect
for
him
but
i
own
i
should
like
to
see
him
a
little
more
practical
i
really
am
pleased
to
hear
you
say
so
it
is
just
what
i
think
and
i
always
fancied
you
did
not
agree
with
me
it
really
puts
me
almost
out
of
patience
to
hear
him
speak
of
mr
walcot
encouraging
sydney
in
his
notions
it
is
unnatural
it
looks
a
little
like
affectation
all
that
sort
of
feeling
about
mr
walcot
i
do
not
object
to
that
i
confess
his
thinking
fairly
of
walcot
can
do
no
harm
and
may
save
mischief
and
it
looks
honourable
and
well
i
do
not
regret
that
i
own
but
i
think
he
is
clearly
wrong
in
selling
his
horse
in
such
a
hurry
all
deerbrook
will
know
it
directly
and
it
will
not
look
well
i
offered
him
such
accommodation
as
would
enable
him
to
keep
it
but
he
is
quite
obstinate
some
enthusiastic
notion
of
honour
i
suppose
but
i
told
them
that
there
is
no
profession
or
business
in
the
world
that
has
not
its
ups
and
downs
exactly
what
i
told
hester
when
she
declined
having
any
parties
at
present
in
the
very
crisis
in
my
opinion
when
it
is
of
great
consequence
that
they
should
get
their
friends
about
them
sophia
would
have
made
the
cake
and
alice
would
have
waited
at
tea
but
the
fact
is
mr
hope
has
put
some
of
his
spirit
into
his
wife
and
they
must
take
their
own
way
i
suppose
he
gave
me
his
reasons
however
observed
mr
grey
he
regards
this
as
something
more
than
one
of
the
slack
times
common
in
his
profession
he
will
not
accept
obligation
while
he
sees
no
clear
prospect
of
being
able
to
discharge
it
i
could
not
prevail
upon
him
however
they
must
have
enough
they
can
not
be
actually
pinched
i
never
saw
him
in
better
spirits
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
our
doing
anything
more
than
just
being
on
the
to
serve
them
we
must
push
them
that
is
all
we
can
do
they
can
not
really
be
wanting
anything
as
you
say
such
fine
spirits
as
they
are
in
hester
looks
sweetly
the
first
game
that
we
have
to
spare
this
season
shall
go
to
them
and
i
shall
bear
them
in
mind
when
we
gather
our
apples
if
you
find
we
have
any
apples
to
gather
my
dear
i
doubt
it
do
you
really
it
will
be
unfortunate
for
our
young
friends
if
prices
rise
next
winter
as
you
seem
to
expect
there
goes
ten
i
declare
and
there
are
the
children
looking
out
for
us
as
well
they
may
but
those
are
really
delightful
young
people
there
is
no
getting
away
from
them
chapter
thirty
five
boating
mr
walcot
was
delighted
with
the
invitation
to
the
but
was
fully
engaged
for
the
next
three
weeks
mr
grey
decreed
that
he
was
to
be
waited
for
then
the
lady
moon
had
to
be
waited
for
another
ten
days
so
that
it
was
past
the
middle
of
august
before
mrs
grey
and
sophia
were
called
upon
to
endure
mr
walcot
society
for
six
hours
the
weather
was
somewhat
dubious
when
the
day
arrived
but
in
so
bad
a
season
as
the
present
it
would
never
do
to
let
a
doubt
put
a
stop
to
an
excursion
which
had
been
planned
above
a
month
one
of
mr
grey
men
was
sent
round
among
the
ladies
in
the
morning
to
request
to
be
the
bearer
of
their
cloaks
as
it
was
thought
they
would
be
cold
on
the
water
without
all
the
wraps
they
had
hester
sent
as
many
warm
things
as
she
thought
margaret
could
possibly
wear
she
was
not
going
herself
she
wished
it
much
but
it
was
decided
on
all
hands
that
it
would
be
imprudent
as
there
was
no
calculating
the
amount
of
fatigue
which
each
might
have
to
incur
at
three
the
party
assembled
on
the
wharf
on
grey
and
rowland
premises
everyone
having
dined
at
home
mrs
rowland
had
tried
to
persuade
mr
walcot
that
he
ought
not
to
be
out
of
the
way
after
what
lady
hunter
had
said
in
a
note
about
her
terrible
headache
of
yesterday
it
might
be
the
beginning
of
a
feverish
attack
and
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
he
should
be
six
miles
down
the
river
not
expected
home
till
nine
or
ten
at
night
when
a
messenger
should
arrive
from
the
hall
but
mr
walcot
had
seen
few
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
he
was
resolved
to
go
margaret
and
her
brother
repaired
in
gay
spirits
to
the
in
the
days
of
poverty
trifles
become
great
events
and
ease
is
luxury
hope
felt
himself
clear
of
the
world
he
had
received
the
money
from
the
sale
of
his
horse
and
after
paying
for
its
corn
there
was
fifteen
pounds
left
to
be
put
by
for
his
rent
hester
had
bidden
adieu
to
the
horse
with
a
sort
of
glee
as
she
had
never
been
able
to
overcome
her
panic
during
her
husband
long
country
rides
and
hope
found
that
he
hung
more
and
more
upon
hester
smiles
they
cheered
him
from
whatever
cause
they
arose
margaret
was
gay
from
discourse
with
philip
she
had
just
despatched
a
letter
to
him
a
letter
which
had
acknowledged
that
it
was
indeed
long
since
they
had
met
that
it
was
almost
time
that
he
was
coming
to
deerbrook
again
the
party
they
joined
looked
less
merry
than
themselves
the
two
boats
which
lay
at
the
wharf
were
gay
enough
the
one
with
crimson
cushions
and
the
other
with
blue
a
was
to
go
in
each
to
take
care
of
the
provisions
and
provide
tea
at
the
ruins
and
alice
and
her
companion
were
alert
and
smiling
but
mrs
grey
wore
a
countenance
of
extraordinary
anxiety
and
the
twitching
of
her
face
showed
that
something
had
gone
very
seriously
wrong
sophia
nearly
turned
her
back
upon
mr
walcot
who
continued
to
address
her
with
patient
diligence
maria
was
sitting
on
some
deals
waiting
to
be
called
to
enter
the
boat
and
some
of
the
people
of
the
village
were
staring
at
her
from
a
little
distance
margaret
immediately
joined
her
what
are
those
people
looking
at
you
for
i
can
not
conceive
i
fancied
that
while
i
was
sitting
i
looked
pretty
much
like
other
people
to
be
sure
you
do
i
will
ask
mr
grey
i
am
sure
there
is
some
meaning
in
their
gaze
so
ridiculously
compassionate
do
not
you
know
said
mr
grey
do
not
you
know
the
story
they
have
got
up
about
miss
young
case
they
say
mr
hope
set
her
limb
so
badly
that
he
had
to
break
it
again
twice
i
have
been
asked
several
times
whether
he
did
not
get
me
to
help
him
and
they
will
not
believe
me
when
i
deny
the
whole
maria
laughed
and
margaret
observed
that
they
would
presently
see
how
much
better
maria
could
walk
now
than
she
did
before
her
last
accident
such
being
the
effect
of
the
long
and
complete
rest
which
had
been
enforced
upon
her
nothing
like
seeing
for
themselves
observed
mr
grey
surveying
the
company
all
come
but
dr
levitt
now
i
think
it
really
goes
to
my
heart
not
to
take
some
of
my
partner
children
there
they
are
peeping
at
us
one
head
behind
another
from
that
gate
there
is
room
for
two
or
three
from
the
jameses
failing
us
at
the
last
the
little
things
might
as
well
go
but
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
use
in
saying
anything
about
it
i
must
have
a
word
with
my
daughter
before
we
embark
sophia
my
dear
sophia
sophia
came
and
margaret
overheard
her
father
say
to
her
that
every
person
present
was
his
guest
and
to
be
treated
with
the
civility
and
attention
due
to
him
as
such
sophia
looked
rather
sulky
at
hearing
this
and
walked
far
away
from
mr
walcot
to
devote
herself
to
miss
anderson
by
dint
of
sending
a
messenger
to
dr
levitt
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
his
presence
was
secured
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
it
he
made
his
usual
approach
looking
bland
and
gentlemanly
and
fearing
he
was
late
the
party
were
ordered
into
the
boats
as
if
they
had
been
going
to
dinner
mr
walcot
was
appointed
to
hand
margaret
in
but
he
showed
amidst
great
simplicity
an
entire
determination
to
be
companion
hope
was
approaching
maria
seat
to
give
her
his
arm
when
some
bustle
was
heard
at
the
gate
where
the
little
rowlands
were
clustered
there
is
my
partner
he
will
go
with
us
after
all
said
mr
grey
come
my
dear
sir
we
have
plenty
of
room
so
much
the
better
for
my
you
have
room
for
enderby
have
you
he
will
be
delighted
to
join
you
i
have
no
doubt
room
for
me
too
i
really
think
i
must
indulge
myself
yes
enderby
took
us
quite
by
surprise
this
morning
but
that
is
his
way
you
know
philip
here
and
without
notice
margaret
thought
she
was
dreaming
the
words
she
heard
she
felt
much
oppressed
as
if
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
so
sudden
and
strange
a
proceeding
at
the
very
moment
of
suspense
she
caught
mrs
grey
eye
fixed
upon
her
with
the
saddest
expression
she
thought
she
had
ever
seen
philip
was
come
it
was
no
dream
he
was
presently
in
the
midst
of
the
party
making
his
compliments
compliments
paid
to
margaret
in
a
manner
scarcely
different
in
the
eyes
of
others
from
those
which
were
shared
by
all
but
to
her
a
world
of
wonder
and
of
horror
was
revealed
by
the
glance
of
the
eye
and
the
quiver
of
the
lip
too
slight
to
be
detected
by
any
eye
less
intently
fixed
than
hers
margaret
stood
alone
as
the
others
were
stepping
into
the
boats
but
philip
did
not
approach
her
he
interfered
between
hope
and
maria
young
maria
looked
agitated
and
uncertain
but
she
thought
she
had
no
right
to
cause
any
delay
or
difficulty
and
she
took
his
arm
though
she
felt
herself
unable
to
conceal
her
trembling
hope
saw
that
margaret
was
scarcely
able
to
support
herself
i
can
not
go
she
said
as
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
leave
me
behind
they
will
not
miss
me
nobody
will
miss
me
the
agonised
tone
of
these
last
words
brought
back
the
colour
which
hope
had
lost
in
the
tempest
of
emotions
in
which
anger
was
uppermost
he
was
no
longer
deadly
pale
when
he
said
impossible
i
can
not
leave
you
you
must
not
stay
behind
it
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
that
you
should
go
can
not
you
do
try
i
will
place
you
beside
mrs
grey
can
not
you
make
the
effort
she
did
make
the
effort
with
desperate
steadiness
she
stepped
into
the
boat
where
mrs
grey
was
seated
she
was
conscious
that
philip
watched
to
see
what
she
would
do
and
then
seated
maria
and
himself
in
the
other
boat
hope
followed
margaret
if
he
had
been
in
the
same
boat
with
enderby
the
temptation
to
throw
him
overboard
would
have
been
too
strong
till
they
were
past
the
weir
and
the
lock
and
all
the
erections
belonging
to
the
village
and
to
the
great
firm
which
dignified
it
the
boats
were
rowed
conversation
went
on
the
grey
church
steeple
was
pronounced
picturesque
as
it
rose
above
the
trees
and
the
children
looked
up
at
dr
levitt
as
if
the
credit
of
it
by
some
means
belonged
to
him
the
rector
sydney
desired
his
younger
sisters
not
to
trail
their
hands
through
the
water
as
it
retarded
the
passage
of
the
boat
the
precise
distance
of
the
ruins
from
deerbrook
ferry
was
argued
and
dr
levitt
gave
some
curious
traditions
about
the
old
abbey
they
were
going
to
see
then
towing
took
the
place
of
rowing
and
the
party
became
very
quiet
the
boat
cut
steadily
through
the
still
waters
the
slight
ripple
at
the
bows
being
the
only
sound
which
marked
its
progress
dr
levitt
pointed
with
his
stick
to
the
verdurous
wall
which
sprang
up
from
the
brink
of
the
river
every
spray
of
the
beech
every
pyramid
of
the
larch
every
leaf
of
the
oak
and
the
tall
column
of
the
occasional
poplar
reflected
true
as
the
natural
magic
of
light
and
waters
could
make
them
some
then
wished
the
sun
would
come
out
without
which
it
could
scarcely
be
called
seeing
the
woods
others
tried
to
recognise
the
person
who
stood
fishing
under
the
great
ash
and
it
took
a
minute
or
two
to
settle
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
boy
and
two
minutes
more
to
decide
that
it
was
nobody
belonging
to
deerbrook
margaret
almost
wondered
that
edward
could
talk
on
about
these
things
as
he
did
so
much
in
his
common
tone
and
manner
but
for
his
ease
and
steadiness
in
small
talk
she
should
suppose
he
was
striving
to
have
her
left
unnoticed
to
look
down
into
the
water
as
strenuously
as
she
pleased
she
little
knew
what
a
training
he
had
had
in
wearing
his
usual
manner
while
his
heart
was
wretched
there
now
cried
fanny
we
have
passed
the
place
the
place
where
cousin
margaret
fell
in
last
winter
we
wanted
to
have
gone
directly
over
it
margaret
looked
up
and
caught
sydney
glance
he
had
not
yet
recovered
from
that
day
if
you
had
mentioned
it
sooner
said
margaret
i
could
have
shown
you
the
very
place
we
did
pass
directly
over
it
oh
why
did
you
not
tell
us
you
should
have
told
us
dr
levitt
smiled
as
he
remarked
that
he
thought
miss
ibbotson
was
likely
to
be
the
last
person
to
point
out
that
spot
to
other
people
as
well
as
to
forget
it
herself
margaret
had
indeed
been
far
from
forgetting
it
she
had
looked
down
into
its
depths
and
had
brought
thence
something
that
had
been
useful
to
her
something
on
which
she
was
meditating
when
fanny
spoke
she
had
been
saved
and
doubtless
for
a
purpose
if
it
was
only
to
suffer
for
her
own
part
and
to
find
no
rest
and
peace
but
in
devoting
herself
to
others
this
was
a
high
purpose
maria
could
live
and
was
thankful
to
live
without
home
or
family
or
prospect
but
it
was
not
certain
that
this
was
all
that
was
to
be
done
and
enjoyed
in
life
something
dreadful
had
happened
but
philip
loved
her
he
still
loved
her
for
nothing
but
agonised
love
could
have
inspired
the
glance
which
yet
thrilled
through
her
there
was
some
mistake
some
fearful
mistake
and
the
want
of
confidence
in
her
which
it
revealed
the
fault
of
temper
in
him
opened
a
long
perspective
of
misery
but
yet
he
loved
her
and
all
was
not
over
at
times
she
felt
certain
that
mrs
rowland
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
new
injury
but
it
was
inconceivable
that
philip
should
be
deluded
by
her
after
his
warnings
and
his
jealous
fears
lest
his
margaret
should
give
heed
to
any
of
his
sister
misrepresentations
no
light
shone
upon
the
question
from
the
cloudy
sky
above
or
the
clear
waters
beneath
but
both
yielded
comfort
through
that
gentle
law
by
which
things
eminently
real
providence
the
mercy
of
death
and
the
blessing
of
godlike
life
are
presented
or
prophesied
to
the
spirit
by
the
shadows
amidst
which
we
live
when
margaret
spoke
there
was
a
calmness
in
her
voice
so
like
an
echo
of
comfort
in
her
heart
that
it
almost
made
edward
start
the
party
in
the
other
boat
were
noisier
whether
or
not
they
were
happier
than
those
in
whose
wake
they
followed
mr
walcot
had
begun
to
be
inspired
as
soon
as
the
oars
had
made
their
first
splash
and
was
now
reciting
to
sophia
some
lines
to
the
setting
sun
which
he
had
learned
when
a
little
boy
and
had
never
forgotten
he
asked
her
whether
it
was
not
a
sweet
idea
that
of
the
declining
sun
being
like
a
good
man
going
to
his
rest
to
rise
again
morning
sophia
was
fond
of
poetry
that
was
not
too
difficult
and
she
found
little
disinclination
in
herself
now
to
observe
her
father
directions
about
being
civil
to
mr
walcot
the
gentleman
perceived
that
he
had
won
some
advantage
and
he
persevered
he
next
spoke
of
the
amiable
poet
cowper
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
miss
grey
was
acquainted
with
some
of
his
writings
that
she
had
at
one
time
been
able
to
repeat
his
piece
on
a
poplar
field
and
those
sweet
lines
beginning
the
rose
had
been
washed
just
washed
in
a
shower
but
she
had
never
heard
the
passage
about
the
twanging
horn
yonder
bridge
and
the
wheeling
the
sofa
round
and
the
cups
that
cheer
but
not
inebriate
so
mr
walcot
repeated
them
not
as
before
in
a
high
key
and
with
his
face
turned
up
towards
the
sky
but
almost
in
a
whisper
and
inclining
towards
her
ear
sophia
sighed
and
thought
it
very
beautiful
and
was
sorry
for
people
who
were
not
fond
of
poetry
a
pause
of
excited
feeling
followed
during
which
they
found
that
the
gentlemen
were
questioning
a
boatman
who
was
awaiting
his
turn
to
tow
about
the
swans
in
the
river
the
swans
have
much
increased
in
number
this
season
surely
those
are
all
of
one
family
i
suppose
those
about
the
island
observed
mr
grey
yes
sir
they
ca
abide
neighbours
they
wo
suffer
a
nest
within
a
mile
they
fight
it
out
if
they
approach
too
near
eh
said
enderby
yes
sir
they
leave
one
another
for
dead
i
have
lost
some
of
the
finest
swans
under
my
charge
in
that
way
do
you
not
part
them
when
they
fight
asked
walcot
i
would
i
always
part
little
boys
whom
i
see
fighting
in
the
streets
and
tell
them
they
should
not
quarrel
you
would
repent
meddling
with
the
swans
sir
if
you
tried
when
i
knew
no
better
i
meddled
once
and
i
thought
i
should
hardly
get
away
alive
one
of
the
creatures
flapped
my
arm
so
hard
that
i
thought
more
than
once
it
was
broken
i
would
advise
you
sir
never
to
go
near
swans
when
they
are
angry
you
will
find
ample
employment
for
your
talents
among
the
deerbrook
people
mr
walcot
said
philip
they
may
break
your
windows
and
perhaps
your
heart
but
they
will
leave
you
your
eyes
and
your
right
arm
for
my
part
i
do
not
know
but
i
had
rather
do
battle
with
the
swans
better
not
sir
said
the
boatman
i
would
advise
you
never
to
go
near
swans
when
they
are
angry
look
said
sophia
anxiously
is
not
this
one
angry
yes
it
is
i
am
sure
it
is
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
its
feathers
and
it
is
coming
this
way
it
is
just
upon
us
oh
mr
walcot
sophia
threw
herself
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
boat
and
mr
walcot
started
up
looking
very
pale
sit
down
cried
mr
grey
in
his
loudest
voice
mr
walcot
sat
down
as
if
shot
and
sophia
crept
back
to
her
place
with
an
anxious
glance
at
the
retreating
bird
of
course
the
two
young
people
were
plentifully
lectured
about
shifting
their
places
in
a
boat
without
leave
and
were
asked
the
question
more
easily
put
than
answered
how
they
should
have
felt
if
they
had
been
the
means
of
precipitating
the
whole
party
into
the
water
then
there
was
a
calling
out
from
the
other
boat
to
know
what
was
the
matter
and
an
explanation
so
that
sophia
and
mr
walcot
had
to
take
refuge
in
mutual
sympathy
from
universal
censure
the
birds
always
quarrel
with
the
boats
boats
of
this
make
explained
the
boatman
because
their
enemies
go
out
in
skiffs
to
take
them
they
let
a
lighter
pass
without
taking
any
notice
while
they
always
scour
the
water
near
a
skiff
but
i
never
heard
of
their
flying
at
a
pleasure
party
in
any
sort
of
boat
where
are
the
black
swans
that
a
brought
to
lady
hunter
asked
philip
i
see
nothing
of
them
the
male
died
choked
sir
with
a
crust
of
bread
a
stranger
gave
him
but
for
that
he
would
have
been
now
in
sight
i
do
doubt
for
he
prospered
very
well
till
that
day
of
a
crust
of
bread
what
a
death
exclaimed
philip
and
the
other
she
died
sir
by
the
visitation
of
god
replied
the
boatman
solemnly
it
was
obviously
so
far
from
the
man
intention
that
any
one
should
laugh
that
nobody
did
laugh
maria
observed
to
her
next
neighbour
that
to
a
keeper
of
swans
his
birds
were
more
companionable
and
quite
as
important
as
their
human
charge
to
coroners
and
jurymen
the
boat
got
aground
amongst
the
flags
at
a
point
where
the
had
to
be
carried
over
a
at
some
little
distance
inland
one
of
the
men
in
attempting
to
leap
the
ditch
had
fallen
in
and
emerged
dripping
with
mud
ben
jumped
ashore
to
take
his
turn
at
the
rope
and
enderby
pushed
the
boat
off
again
with
an
oar
with
some
little
effort
mr
walcot
had
squeezed
sophia
parasol
so
hard
during
the
crisis
as
to
break
its
ivory
ring
the
accident
mortifying
as
it
was
to
him
did
not
prevent
his
exclaiming
in
a
fervour
of
gratitude
when
the
vibration
of
the
boat
was
over
and
they
were
once
more
afloat
what
an
exceedingly
clever
man
mr
enderby
is
extremely
clever
i
really
think
he
can
do
everything
ah
he
would
not
have
managed
to
break
the
ring
of
your
parasol
as
i
have
been
so
awkward
as
to
do
but
i
will
see
about
getting
it
mended
if
i
were
as
clever
as
mr
enderby
now
i
might
be
able
to
mend
it
myself
you
will
not
be
able
to
get
another
ring
in
deerbrook
but
never
mind
i
beg
you
will
not
feel
uncomfortable
about
it
i
can
fasten
it
with
a
loop
of
green
ribbon
and
a
button
till
the
next
time
i
go
to
blickley
pray
do
not
feel
uncomfortable
how
can
i
help
it
you
say
there
is
no
ring
in
deerbrook
not
any
sort
of
ring
my
dear
miss
grey
if
i
can
not
repair
this
sort
of
ring
sophia
was
a
good
deal
flurried
she
begged
he
would
think
no
more
of
the
parasol
it
was
no
manner
of
consequence
do
not
be
too
good
to
me
whispered
he
i
trust
i
know
my
duty
better
than
to
take
you
at
your
word
from
my
earliest
years
my
parents
have
instilled
into
me
the
duty
of
making
reparation
for
the
injuries
we
cause
to
others
sophia
gave
him
an
affecting
look
of
approbation
and
asked
with
much
interest
where
his
parents
lived
and
how
many
brothers
and
sisters
he
had
and
assured
him
at
last
that
she
saw
he
belonged
to
a
charming
family
it
does
not
become
me
to
speak
proudly
of
such
near
relations
said
he
and
one
who
has
so
lately
left
the
parental
roof
is
perhaps
scarcely
to
be
trusted
to
be
impartial
but
i
will
say
for
my
family
that
though
not
perhaps
so
clever
as
mrs
rowland
and
mr
enderby
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
not
name
them
together
mr
walcot
saw
that
he
had
broken
the
charm
he
hastened
to
repair
the
mischief
which
one
unhappy
name
had
caused
it
is
natural
i
know
that
you
should
take
the
most
interest
in
that
member
of
the
family
who
is
to
be
your
relation
you
consider
him
in
that
light
i
believe
of
course
he
is
to
be
our
cousin
the
parties
wish
it
to
be
kept
a
secret
i
conclude
said
he
glancing
at
enderby
and
then
stretching
back
as
far
as
he
thought
safe
to
look
at
the
other
boat
oh
dear
no
there
is
no
secret
about
the
matter
i
should
not
have
supposed
them
to
be
engaged
by
their
manner
to
each
other
perhaps
it
is
off
said
he
quickly
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
off
what
an
odd
idea
who
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
such
things
have
been
heard
of
as
engagements
going
off
you
know
both
had
raised
their
voices
during
the
last
few
eager
sentences
sophia
became
aware
that
they
had
been
overheard
by
seeing
the
deep
flush
which
overspread
miss
young
pale
face
philip
looked
at
mr
walcot
as
if
he
would
have
knocked
him
down
if
they
had
only
been
on
land
the
young
man
took
off
his
hat
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
white
hair
for
the
sake
of
something
to
do
replaced
his
hat
and
shook
his
head
manfully
as
if
to
settle
his
heart
in
his
breast
as
well
as
his
beaver
on
his
crown
he
glanced
down
the
river
in
hopes
that
the
abbey
was
not
yet
too
near
it
was
important
to
him
that
the
wrath
of
so
extremely
clever
a
man
as
mr
enderby
should
have
subsided
before
the
party
went
on
shore
it
would
have
been
a
strange
thing
to
have
known
how
many
of
that
company
were
dreading
to
reach
the
object
of
their
excursion
a
thrill
passed
through
many
hearts
when
the
ruins
with
their
overshadowing
ivy
were
at
length
discerned
seated
in
the
meadow
to
which
the
boats
seemed
approaching
far
too
rapidly
in
the
bustle
of
landing
however
it
was
easy
for
those
who
wished
to
avoid
one
another
to
do
so
most
of
the
guests
walked
straight
up
to
the
abbey
walls
to
examine
all
that
was
left
of
them
mrs
grey
and
her
maids
went
to
the
little
farmhouse
which
was
at
one
corner
of
the
old
building
and
chiefly
constructed
out
of
its
ruins
and
while
the
parties
on
whom
the
cares
of
hospitality
devolved
were
consulting
with
the
farmer
wife
about
preparations
for
tea
any
stray
guest
might
search
for
in
the
skirts
of
the
copse
on
the
hill
behind
or
talk
with
the
children
who
were
jumping
in
and
out
of
an
old
in
the
wood
or
if
contemplative
might
watch
the
minnows
in
the
brook
which
was
here
running
parallel
with
the
river
mrs
grey
obviously
considered
that
margaret
was
her
peculiar
charge
she
spoke
little
to
her
but
when
philip
was
off
somewhere
she
took
her
arm
and
seemed
to
insist
on
her
company
when
she
proceeded
to
her
treaty
with
the
dame
of
the
farm
margaret
stood
for
some
time
patiently
while
they
discussed
whether
it
should
be
tea
in
the
farmhouse
parlour
which
was
too
small
or
tea
in
the
meadow
which
might
be
damp
or
tea
in
the
ruins
where
there
might
be
draughts
and
the
water
could
not
be
supplied
hot
before
this
matter
was
settled
margaret
saw
that
her
friend
maria
was
seated
on
a
log
beside
the
brook
and
gazing
wistfully
at
her
margaret
tried
to
disengage
her
arm
from
mrs
grey
mrs
grey
objected
wait
a
moment
my
dear
i
will
not
detain
you
five
minutes
you
must
not
go
anywhere
without
me
my
dear
child
never
before
had
mrs
grey
spoken
to
margaret
with
tenderness
like
this
margaret
was
resolved
to
know
why
now
but
she
would
first
speak
to
maria
she
said
she
would
return
presently
she
wished
to
return
but
she
must
speak
to
maria
margaret
what
is
all
this
said
maria
in
a
voice
whose
agitation
she
could
not
control
have
i
been
doing
wrong
am
i
now
thinking
what
is
wrong
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
with
him
or
not
i
was
afraid
to
speak
to
him
and
afraid
not
to
speak
to
him
how
is
it
tell
me
margaret
i
wish
i
could
said
margaret
in
a
tone
calmer
than
her
friend
i
am
in
a
miserable
dream
i
wrote
to
him
this
morning
to
london
yes
to
london
he
must
have
been
in
deerbrook
while
i
was
writing
it
i
heard
from
him
as
usual
three
days
ago
and
since
then
i
have
never
had
a
line
or
a
word
to
prepare
me
for
this
there
is
some
dreadful
mistake
the
mistake
is
not
his
i
fear
said
maria
her
eyes
filling
as
she
spoke
the
mistake
is
yours
margaret
and
mine
and
everybody
who
took
a
selfish
man
of
the
world
for
a
being
with
a
heart
and
a
conscience
you
are
wrong
maria
you
go
too
far
you
will
find
that
you
are
unjust
he
is
as
wretched
as
i
am
there
is
some
mistake
which
may
be
explained
for
he
he
loves
me
i
am
certain
but
i
wish
i
was
anywhere
but
here
it
is
so
wretched
i
am
afraid
i
have
done
wrong
in
speaking
with
him
at
all
said
maria
i
longed
for
three
words
with
you
for
i
did
not
know
what
i
ought
to
do
we
must
learn
something
before
we
return
your
friends
must
act
for
you
where
is
mr
hope
i
do
not
know
everybody
deserts
me
i
think
i
will
not
it
is
little
i
can
do
but
stay
by
me
do
not
leave
me
i
will
watch
for
you
margaret
fell
into
the
common
error
of
the
wretched
when
she
said
these
last
words
her
brother
was
at
work
on
her
behalf
hope
had
gone
towards
the
ruins
with
the
rest
of
the
party
to
keep
his
eye
on
enderby
sophia
hung
on
his
arm
which
she
had
taken
that
she
might
relieve
herself
of
some
thoughts
which
she
could
not
so
well
speak
to
any
one
of
the
strangers
of
the
party
oh
mr
hope
cried
she
how
very
much
mistaken
we
have
been
in
mr
walcot
all
this
time
he
is
a
most
delightful
young
man
so
refined
and
so
domestic
indeed
you
will
trust
sydney
judgment
more
readily
another
time
yes
indeed
but
i
could
not
help
telling
you
i
know
you
will
not
be
offended
though
some
people
perhaps
would
not
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
but
i
know
you
will
excuse
it
and
not
be
offended
so
far
from
being
offended
i
like
what
you
now
say
far
better
than
the
way
i
have
heard
you
sometimes
speak
of
mr
walcot
i
have
thought
before
that
you
did
not
allow
him
fair
play
now
in
my
turn
i
must
ask
you
not
to
be
offended
with
me
oh
i
never
could
be
offended
with
you
you
are
always
so
good
and
amiable
mamma
seemed
a
little
vexed
when
you
encouraged
sydney
to
praise
mr
walcot
but
she
will
be
delighted
at
your
opinion
of
him
when
she
finds
how
accomplished
he
is
and
so
refined
you
speak
of
my
opinion
i
have
no
opinion
about
mr
walcot
yet
because
i
do
not
know
him
you
must
remember
that
though
all
deerbrook
has
been
busy
about
him
since
may
i
have
scarcely
heard
him
say
five
words
i
do
not
speak
as
having
any
opinion
of
him
one
way
or
another
how
dark
this
place
looks
that
aisle
how
gloomy
i
think
it
is
the
weather
there
is
no
sun
and
the
ivy
tosses
about
strangely
what
do
you
think
of
the
weather
i
think
we
shall
have
the
least
possible
benefit
of
the
moon
how
like
a
solid
wall
those
clouds
look
low
down
in
the
sky
here
comes
mr
walcot
suppose
you
let
him
take
you
after
the
rest
of
the
party
you
will
not
like
the
gloom
of
that
aisle
where
i
am
going
both
sophia
and
mr
walcot
much
preferred
each
other
company
to
the
damp
and
shadow
of
the
interior
of
the
abbey
they
walked
off
together
and
gathered
meadow
flowers
and
admired
poetry
and
poets
till
all
were
summoned
and
they
were
compelled
to
join
the
groups
who
were
converging
from
copse
brook
and
cloister
towards
the
green
before
the
farmhouse
where
after
all
the
long
was
spread
the
reason
of
hope
anxiety
to
consign
sophia
to
mr
walcot
charge
was
that
he
saw
enderby
pacing
the
aisle
alone
with
rapid
steps
his
face
hung
with
gloom
as
deep
as
darkened
the
walls
about
him
enderby
are
you
mad
cried
hope
hastening
in
to
him
i
believe
i
am
as
you
are
aware
no
man
has
better
cause
i
wait
your
explanation
till
i
have
it
your
conduct
is
a
perfect
mystery
to
margaret
or
to
me
for
her
you
must
explain
yourself
and
that
immediately
in
the
mean
time
i
do
not
know
how
to
address
you
how
to
judge
you
then
mrs
grey
has
not
told
you
of
our
conversation
of
this
morning
no
said
hope
his
heart
suddenly
failing
him
the
whole
dreadful
story
has
become
known
to
me
and
i
am
thankful
that
it
is
revealed
before
it
is
too
late
my
sister
is
sometimes
right
however
she
may
be
often
wrong
she
has
done
me
a
cruel
kindness
now
i
know
all
hope
how
you
loved
margaret
how
when
it
was
too
late
you
discovered
that
margaret
loved
you
how
when
i
burst
in
upon
you
and
her
she
was
oh
why
did
i
ever
see
her
again
she
was
learning
from
you
the
absurd
resolution
which
mrs
grey
had
been
urging
upon
you
by
working
upon
your
false
sense
of
honour
a
sense
of
honour
of
which
i
am
to
have
none
of
the
benefit
since
after
marrying
the
one
sister
out
of
compassion
and
to
please
mrs
grey
you
turn
the
other
over
to
me
innocent
in
soul
and
conscience
i
know
but
no
longer
with
virgin
affections
you
give
her
to
me
for
your
mutual
security
and
consolation
enderby
you
mad
cried
hope
his
strength
being
roused
by
this
extent
of
accusation
from
the
depression
caused
by
the
mixture
of
truth
in
the
dreadful
words
philip
had
just
spoken
but
mad
deluded
or
wicked
however
you
may
have
been
wrought
into
this
state
of
mind
there
are
two
things
which
must
be
said
on
the
instant
and
regarded
by
you
in
all
coming
time
these
charges
as
they
relate
to
myself
had
better
be
spoken
of
at
another
opportunity
and
when
you
are
in
a
calmer
state
of
mind
but
meanwhile
i
as
a
husband
forbid
you
to
speak
lightly
of
my
beloved
and
honoured
wife
and
i
also
charge
you
as
you
revere
the
purity
of
margaret
soul
of
the
innocent
soul
and
conscience
of
which
you
speak
that
you
do
not
convey
to
her
by
the
remotest
intimation
any
conception
of
the
horrible
tale
with
which
some
wretch
has
been
deluding
you
she
never
loved
any
one
but
you
if
you
pollute
and
agonise
her
imagination
with
these
vile
fancies
of
your
sister
for
from
whom
else
can
such
inventions
come
remember
that
you
peril
the
peace
of
an
innocent
family
you
poison
the
friendship
of
sisters
whom
bereavement
has
bound
to
each
other
and
deprive
margaret
of
all
that
life
contains
for
her
you
will
not
impair
my
wife
faith
in
me
i
am
confident
but
you
may
turn
margaret
brain
if
you
say
to
her
anything
like
what
passed
your
lips
just
now
it
seems
but
a
short
time
enderby
since
we
committed
margaret
happiness
to
your
care
and
now
i
have
to
appeal
on
her
behalf
to
your
honour
and
conscience
mrs
grey
mrs
grey
enderby
repeated
fixing
his
eyes
upon
countenance
the
quarrel
between
you
and
me
shall
be
attended
to
in
its
turn
enderby
i
must
first
secure
my
wife
and
margaret
from
any
rashness
on
your
part
if
you
put
distrust
between
them
and
pollute
their
home
by
the
wildest
of
fancies
it
would
be
better
for
you
that
these
walls
should
fall
upon
us
and
bury
us
both
oh
that
they
would
cried
philip
i
am
sick
of
living
in
the
midst
of
treachery
life
is
a
waste
to
a
man
treated
as
i
have
been
answer
me
enderby
answer
me
this
instant
hope
cried
advancing
to
place
himself
between
enderby
and
margaret
whom
he
saw
now
entering
the
ruin
and
rapidly
approaching
them
you
are
right
said
enderby
aloud
you
may
trust
me
philip
what
am
i
to
think
said
margaret
walking
quite
up
to
him
and
looking
intently
in
his
face
i
hardly
know
whether
we
are
living
and
in
our
common
world
hope
shuddered
to
see
the
glance
she
cast
round
the
dreary
place
philip
half
turned
away
and
did
not
speak
why
will
not
you
speak
what
reason
can
there
be
for
this
silence
when
you
last
left
me
you
feared
your
sister
might
make
mischief
between
us
and
then
i
promised
that
if
such
a
thing
could
happen
as
that
i
should
doubt
you
i
would
tell
you
my
doubt
as
soon
as
i
was
aware
of
it
myself
and
now
you
are
angry
with
me
you
would
strike
me
dead
this
moment
if
you
dared
and
you
will
not
speak
go
now
margaret
said
hope
gently
he
can
not
speak
to
you
now
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
can
not
i
will
not
go
i
will
take
nobody
word
what
are
you
edward
between
me
and
him
it
is
my
right
to
know
how
i
have
offended
him
i
require
no
more
than
my
right
i
do
not
ask
him
to
love
me
nor
need
i
for
he
loves
me
still
i
know
it
and
feel
it
it
is
true
said
enderby
mournfully
gazing
upon
her
agitated
countenance
but
retreating
as
he
gazed
i
do
not
ask
to
be
yours
any
farther
than
i
am
now
now
when
our
affections
are
true
and
our
word
is
broken
but
i
do
insist
upon
your
esteem
as
far
as
i
have
ever
possessed
it
i
have
done
nothing
to
forfeit
it
and
i
demand
your
reasons
for
supposing
that
i
have
not
now
said
philip
faintly
shrinking
in
the
presence
of
the
two
concerning
whom
he
entertained
so
painful
a
complexity
of
feelings
there
stood
hope
firm
as
the
pillar
behind
him
there
stood
margaret
agitated
but
unabashed
as
the
angels
that
come
in
dreams
was
it
possible
that
these
two
had
loved
could
they
then
stand
before
him
thus
but
mrs
grey
what
she
admitted
this
in
confirmation
with
other
evidence
could
not
be
cast
aside
yet
philip
dared
not
speak
fearing
to
injure
beyond
reparation
oh
margaret
not
now
he
faintly
repeated
my
heart
is
almost
broken
give
me
time
you
have
given
me
none
let
that
pass
however
but
i
can
not
give
you
time
i
can
not
hold
out
who
can
hold
out
under
injurious
secrecy
under
mocking
injustice
under
torturing
doubt
from
the
one
who
is
pledged
to
the
extreme
of
confidence
let
us
once
understand
one
another
and
we
will
never
meet
more
and
i
will
endure
whatever
must
be
endured
and
we
shall
have
time
oh
what
a
weary
time
to
learn
to
submit
but
not
till
you
have
given
me
the
confidence
you
owe
the
last
i
shall
ever
ask
from
you
will
i
endure
one
moment
suspense
i
will
not
give
you
time
yes
margaret
you
will
you
must
said
hope
it
is
hard
very
hard
but
enderby
is
so
far
right
god
help
me
for
every
one
is
against
me
cried
margaret
sinking
down
among
the
long
grass
and
laying
her
throbbing
head
upon
the
cold
stone
he
comes
without
notice
to
terrify
me
by
his
anger
me
whom
he
loves
above
all
the
world
he
leaves
my
heart
to
break
with
his
unkindness
in
the
midst
of
all
these
indifferent
people
he
denies
me
the
explanation
i
demand
and
you
you
of
all
others
tell
me
he
is
right
i
will
do
without
protection
since
the
two
who
owe
it
forsake
me
but
god
is
my
witness
how
you
wrong
me
enderby
why
do
not
you
go
said
hope
sternly
almost
before
the
words
were
spoken
enderby
had
disappeared
at
the
further
end
of
the
aisle
patience
margaret
a
little
patience
my
dear
sister
all
may
be
well
all
must
be
well
for
such
as
you
but
i
mean
that
i
trust
all
may
be
repaired
he
has
been
wrought
upon
by
some
bad
influence
then
all
is
over
if
knowing
me
as
he
did
but
edward
do
not
speak
to
me
go
leave
me
i
can
not
speak
another
word
now
i
can
not
leave
you
here
this
is
no
place
for
you
think
of
your
sister
margaret
you
will
do
nothing
to
alarm
her
if
she
were
to
see
you
now
margaret
raised
herself
took
her
brother
arm
and
went
out
into
the
air
no
one
was
near
now
leave
me
brother
i
must
be
alone
i
will
walk
here
and
think
what
i
must
do
but
how
can
i
know
when
all
is
made
such
a
mystery
oh
brother
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
calm
yourself
now
command
yourself
for
this
day
you
innocent
as
you
are
may
well
do
so
if
i
had
such
a
conscience
as
yours
if
i
were
only
in
your
place
margaret
if
i
had
nothing
to
bear
but
wrongs
i
would
thank
heaven
as
heaven
was
never
yet
thanked
you
edward
if
the
universe
heaped
injuries
upon
me
they
should
not
crush
me
if
i
had
a
like
yours
i
would
lift
my
head
to
the
stars
you
edward
margaret
wretched
as
you
are
your
misery
is
nothing
to
mine
have
pity
upon
me
and
command
yourself
for
my
sake
and
your
sister
look
and
act
like
yourself
and
hope
peacefully
trust
steadily
that
all
will
yet
be
right
it
can
not
be
that
you
have
wronged
me
brother
you
sent
him
from
me
i
know
and
that
was
unkind
but
you
could
never
really
wrong
any
one
i
never
meant
it
i
honour
you
and
would
protect
you
i
will
protect
you
as
a
brother
should
only
do
not
say
again
that
you
are
forsaken
it
would
break
our
hearts
to
hear
you
say
that
again
i
will
not
and
i
will
try
to
be
for
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
promise
no
more
than
to
endeavour
i
am
so
bewildered
then
i
will
leave
you
i
shall
not
be
far
off
no
one
shall
come
to
disturb
you
there
is
perhaps
no
mood
of
mind
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
sweet
ministrations
of
nature
to
be
accepted
even
now
as
margaret
stood
on
the
the
influences
of
the
scene
flowed
in
upon
her
the
operations
of
thought
were
quickened
and
she
was
presently
convinced
that
the
next
time
she
saw
philip
she
should
learn
all
she
might
even
find
him
repentant
for
having
been
weak
and
credulous
edward
was
the
most
inexplicable
mystery
of
all
in
his
brotherly
grief
he
had
no
doubt
exaggerated
some
slight
carelessness
of
speech
some
deficiency
of
watchfulness
and
zeal
hester
must
never
know
of
these
sorrowful
things
that
edward
had
said
there
was
substantial
comfort
in
other
of
his
words
it
was
true
that
she
was
only
wronged
in
her
former
season
of
wretchedness
it
had
been
far
worse
there
was
not
only
disappointment
but
humiliation
loss
not
only
of
hope
but
of
now
she
was
innocent
of
any
wrong
towards
philip
and
herself
and
in
this
consciousness
any
lot
must
be
supportable
while
thus
musing
she
walked
slowly
along
sighing
away
some
of
her
oppression
her
heart
and
head
throbbed
less
her
eye
was
caught
by
the
little
fish
that
leaped
out
of
the
water
after
the
evening
flies
she
stood
to
watch
them
the
splash
of
a
roused
her
ear
and
she
turned
to
track
him
across
the
stream
then
she
saw
a
fine
yellow
iris
growing
among
the
flags
on
the
very
brink
and
she
must
have
it
for
maria
to
reach
it
without
a
wetting
required
some
skill
and
time
she
tried
this
way
she
tried
that
but
the
flower
was
just
out
of
reach
she
went
to
the
next
for
a
bough
which
answered
her
purpose
and
she
had
drawn
the
tuft
of
flags
towards
her
and
laid
hold
of
the
iris
when
sydney
shouted
her
name
from
a
distance
and
summoned
her
to
tea
maria
was
seated
at
the
table
amidst
the
greater
proportion
of
the
party
when
margaret
arrived
escorted
by
sydney
and
followed
at
a
little
distance
by
mr
hope
never
had
flower
been
more
welcome
to
maria
than
this
iris
offered
to
her
with
a
smile
pale
as
the
face
was
and
heavy
as
were
the
eyes
there
was
a
genuine
smile
maria
had
kept
a
place
for
margaret
which
she
took
though
mrs
grey
kept
gazing
at
her
and
assured
her
that
she
must
sit
beside
her
mr
enderby
was
not
to
be
seen
frequent
proclamation
was
made
for
him
but
he
did
not
appear
and
it
was
settled
that
if
he
preferred
to
good
cheer
he
must
have
his
own
way
tea
passed
off
well
enough
dr
levitt
and
mr
hope
went
over
the
subject
of
the
abbey
again
for
the
benefit
of
the
rearward
portion
of
the
company
who
had
not
heard
it
before
mr
rowland
and
the
farmer
discussed
the
bad
crops
sophia
spilled
her
tea
from
mr
walcot
having
made
her
laugh
when
she
was
carrying
the
cup
to
her
lips
and
sydney
collected
a
portion
of
every
good
thing
that
was
on
the
table
for
mr
enderby
to
enjoy
on
his
return
mr
enderby
did
not
return
till
it
was
quite
time
to
be
gone
mr
grey
had
long
been
hurrying
the
servants
in
their
business
of
packing
up
plates
and
spoons
he
even
offered
help
and
repeated
his
cautions
to
his
guests
not
to
stray
beyond
call
the
farmer
shook
his
head
as
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
across
which
black
masses
of
cloud
like
condensed
smoke
were
whirled
and
prophesied
a
stormy
night
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
boatmen
came
bustling
out
of
the
still
munching
and
they
put
the
boats
in
trim
with
all
speed
while
the
ladies
stood
on
the
bank
quite
ready
to
step
in
mrs
grey
assorted
the
two
parties
still
claiming
margaret
for
her
own
boat
but
allowing
maria
to
enter
instead
of
sydney
hope
chose
to
remain
with
them
so
dr
levitt
exchanged
with
sophia
mr
walcot
thought
there
was
a
lion
in
his
path
either
way
mr
hope
his
professional
rival
in
one
boat
and
mr
enderby
whom
he
fancied
he
had
offended
in
the
other
he
adhered
to
sophia
as
a
sure
ally
mr
enderby
where
can
he
be
was
the
exclamation
when
all
were
seated
and
the
boatmen
stood
ready
to
start
with
the
about
their
shoulders
when
the
dame
of
the
farm
had
made
her
parting
curtsey
and
had
stepped
a
few
paces
backward
after
her
swimming
obeisance
the
farmer
was
running
over
the
meadow
towards
the
copse
in
search
of
the
missing
gentleman
and
sydney
would
have
sprung
out
of
the
boat
to
join
in
the
chase
when
his
father
laid
a
strong
hand
on
him
and
said
that
one
stray
member
of
a
party
on
a
threatening
evening
was
enough
he
could
not
have
people
running
after
one
another
till
the
storm
came
on
mr
rowland
was
full
of
concern
and
would
have
had
sydney
throw
away
the
basketful
of
good
things
he
had
hoarded
for
his
friend
if
enderby
chose
to
absent
himself
for
his
own
enjoyments
mr
rowland
said
he
could
not
expect
to
share
other
people
hope
was
standing
up
in
the
first
boat
gazing
anxiously
round
and
margaret
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
face
when
every
body
cried
out
at
once
here
he
is
here
he
comes
and
enderby
was
seen
leaping
through
a
gap
in
the
farthest
hedge
and
bounding
over
the
meadow
he
sprang
into
the
boat
with
a
force
which
set
it
rocking
and
made
the
ladies
catch
at
whatever
could
be
grasped
your
hat
exclaimed
several
voices
why
mr
enderby
where
is
your
hat
cried
sydney
laughing
enderby
clapped
his
hand
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
declared
he
did
not
know
he
had
not
missed
his
hat
till
this
moment
hope
called
from
the
first
boat
to
the
farmer
and
asked
him
to
look
in
the
aisle
of
the
abbey
for
the
gentleman
hat
it
was
brought
thence
and
fanny
and
mary
laughed
at
mr
hope
for
being
such
a
good
guesser
as
to
fancy
where
mr
enderby
hat
might
be
when
mr
enderby
did
not
know
himself
the
moment
the
hat
was
tossed
into
the
lap
of
its
owner
mr
grey
voice
was
heard
shouting
to
the
men
start
off
and
get
us
home
as
soon
as
you
can
the
men
gave
a
glance
at
the
sky
and
set
forth
at
a
smart
pace
mr
grey
saw
that
the
umbrellas
lay
at
his
hand
ready
for
distribution
and
advised
each
lady
to
draw
her
cloak
about
her
as
the
air
felt
to
him
damp
and
chill
a
general
flatness
being
perceptible
some
one
proposed
that
somebody
else
should
sing
all
declined
at
first
however
except
maria
whose
voice
was
always
most
ready
when
it
was
most
difficult
to
sing
when
the
party
was
dull
or
when
no
one
else
would
begin
she
wanted
to
prevent
margaret
being
applied
to
and
she
sang
once
and
again
on
the
slightest
hint
sophia
had
no
and
could
not
sing
without
the
piano
as
every
one
knew
beforehand
she
would
say
mrs
grey
dropped
a
tear
to
the
memory
of
mrs
enderby
whose
ballad
was
never
wanting
on
such
occasions
as
these
sydney
concluded
that
it
was
the
same
thought
which
made
mr
enderby
bury
his
head
in
his
hat
between
his
knees
while
miss
young
was
singing
it
could
not
surely
be
all
from
shame
at
having
kept
the
party
waiting
it
was
with
some
uncertainty
and
awe
that
he
whispered
in
his
ear
do
you
think
you
could
sing
your
new
song
that
cousin
margaret
is
so
fond
of
do
we
are
all
as
flat
as
flounders
and
everybody
will
be
asleep
presently
if
we
do
do
something
ca
you
get
over
a
thing
or
two
and
sing
for
us
i
am
sure
i
would
if
i
only
could
enderby
shook
his
head
without
raising
it
from
his
knees
mr
walcot
had
no
idea
of
refusing
when
he
was
asked
he
could
sing
the
canadian
boat
song
but
he
was
afraid
they
might
have
heard
it
before
never
mind
that
let
us
have
it
said
everybody
but
there
should
be
two
it
is
a
duet
properly
you
know
sophia
believed
she
could
sing
that
just
that
without
the
piano
she
would
try
the
first
part
if
he
would
take
the
second
mr
grey
thought
to
himself
that
his
daughter
seemed
to
have
adopted
his
hint
about
civility
to
his
guests
very
dutifully
but
mr
walcot
could
sing
only
the
first
part
because
he
had
a
brother
at
home
who
always
took
the
second
he
could
soon
learn
it
he
had
no
doubt
but
he
did
not
know
it
at
present
so
he
had
the
duet
all
to
himself
uplifting
a
slender
voice
in
a
very
odd
key
which
fanny
and
mary
did
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
they
looked
round
into
all
the
faces
in
their
boat
to
see
whether
anyone
was
going
to
laugh
but
everybody
was
immoveable
except
that
sophia
whispered
softly
to
miss
young
that
mr
walcot
was
a
most
delightful
young
man
after
all
so
accomplished
and
so
refined
mr
walcot
song
ended
with
a
quaver
from
a
large
cold
startling
drop
of
rain
falling
on
his
nose
as
he
closed
his
eyes
to
draw
out
his
last
note
he
blushed
at
having
started
and
flinched
from
a
drop
of
rain
and
so
spoiled
his
conclusion
some
of
his
hearers
supposed
he
had
till
assured
by
others
that
he
had
finished
then
everybody
thanked
him
and
agreed
that
the
rain
was
really
coming
on
there
were
now
odd
fleeces
of
white
cloud
between
the
lead
colour
and
the
black
they
were
hurried
about
in
the
sky
evidently
by
counter
currents
the
river
was
almost
inky
in
its
hue
and
every
large
drop
made
its
own
splash
and
circle
up
went
the
umbrellas
in
both
boats
but
almost
before
they
were
raised
some
were
turned
inside
out
and
all
were
dragged
down
again
the
gust
had
come
and
brought
with
it
a
pelt
of
hail
large
hailstones
which
fell
in
at
fanny
collar
behind
while
she
put
down
her
head
to
save
her
face
and
which
almost
took
away
mary
breath
by
coming
sharp
and
fast
against
her
cheeks
then
somebody
descried
a
gleam
of
lightning
quivering
in
the
grey
roof
of
the
sky
and
next
every
one
saw
the
tremendous
flash
which
blazed
over
the
surface
of
the
water
all
round
about
how
mr
walcot
would
have
quavered
if
he
had
been
singing
still
but
a
very
different
voice
was
now
to
be
heard
the
hoarse
thunder
rolling
up
like
advancing
artillery
first
growling
then
roaring
and
presently
crashing
and
rattling
overhead
the
boatmen
thoughts
were
for
the
ladies
exposed
as
they
were
without
the
possibility
of
putting
up
umbrellas
it
felt
almost
dark
to
those
in
the
boats
as
they
cut
rapidly
more
and
more
rapidly
through
the
water
which
seethed
about
the
bows
the
men
were
trotting
running
presently
it
was
darker
still
the
bent
heads
were
raised
and
it
appeared
that
the
boats
were
brought
to
under
the
wide
branches
of
two
oaks
which
overhung
the
water
the
woods
were
reached
already
shelter
for
the
ladies
sir
said
the
panting
boatmen
touching
their
hats
and
then
taking
them
off
to
wipe
their
brows
mr
grey
looked
doubtful
stood
up
to
survey
and
then
asked
if
there
was
no
farm
no
sort
of
house
anywhere
near
none
nearer
than
you
village
where
the
spire
was
and
that
was
very
little
nearer
than
deerbrook
itself
the
ladies
who
were
disposed
to
say
anything
observed
that
they
were
very
well
as
they
were
the
tree
kept
off
a
great
deal
of
the
hail
and
the
wind
was
not
felt
quite
so
much
as
on
the
open
river
should
they
sit
still
or
step
on
shore
sit
still
by
all
means
packed
closely
as
they
were
they
would
be
warmer
and
drier
than
standing
on
shore
and
they
were
now
ready
to
start
homewards
as
soon
as
the
storm
should
abate
it
did
not
appear
that
there
was
any
abatement
of
the
storm
in
five
minutes
nor
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
young
people
looked
up
at
the
elder
ones
as
if
asking
what
to
expect
several
of
the
party
happened
to
be
glancing
in
the
same
direction
with
the
boatmen
when
they
saw
a
shaft
of
lightning
strike
perpendicularly
from
the
upper
range
of
cloud
upon
the
village
spire
and
light
it
up
lord
bless
us
exclaimed
mr
grey
as
the
spire
sent
its
smoke
up
like
a
little
volcano
fanny
burst
out
but
was
called
a
silly
child
and
desired
not
to
make
a
noise
everyone
was
silent
enough
now
most
hiding
their
faces
that
they
might
not
see
what
happened
next
half
way
between
the
river
and
the
smoking
church
in
the
farther
part
of
the
opposite
meadow
was
a
fine
spreading
oak
under
which
as
might
just
be
seen
a
flock
of
sheep
were
huddled
together
for
shelter
another
fiery
dart
shot
down
from
the
dark
canopy
upon
the
crown
of
this
oak
the
tree
quivered
and
fell
asunder
its
fragments
lying
in
a
circle
there
was
a
rush
forth
of
such
of
the
sheep
as
escaped
and
a
rattle
of
thunder
which
would
have
overpowered
any
ordinary
voices
but
in
the
midst
of
which
a
scream
was
heard
from
the
first
boat
it
was
a
singular
thing
that
in
talking
over
this
storm
in
at
home
no
lady
would
own
this
scream
i
thinking
sir
said
ben
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
we
are
in
a
bad
place
here
as
the
storm
seems
thickening
this
way
we
had
best
get
from
under
the
trees
for
all
the
hail
do
so
ben
and
make
haste
when
the
first
boat
was
brought
a
little
out
into
the
stream
in
order
to
clear
it
of
the
flags
margaret
became
aware
that
philip
was
gazing
earnestly
at
her
from
the
other
boat
she
alone
of
the
ladies
had
sat
with
face
upraised
watching
the
advance
of
the
storm
she
alone
perhaps
of
all
the
company
had
enjoyed
it
with
pure
relish
it
had
animated
her
mind
and
restored
her
to
herself
when
she
saw
philip
leaning
back
on
his
elbow
almost
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
to
contemplate
her
she
returned
his
gaze
with
such
an
expression
of
mournful
wonder
and
composed
sorrow
as
moved
him
to
draw
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
resolve
to
look
no
more
the
storm
abated
but
did
not
cease
rain
succeeded
to
hail
lightning
still
hovered
in
the
air
and
thunder
continued
to
growl
afar
off
but
the
umbrellas
could
now
be
kept
up
and
the
ladies
escaped
with
a
slight
wetting
before
the
party
dispersed
from
the
wharf
hope
sought
philip
and
had
a
few
moments
conversation
with
him
the
object
of
which
was
to
agree
upon
further
discourse
on
the
morrow
hope
and
margaret
then
accompanied
maria
to
her
lodging
and
walked
thence
silently
home
hester
was
on
the
watch
for
them
a
little
anxious
lest
they
should
have
suffered
from
the
storm
and
ready
with
some
reflections
on
the
liabilities
of
parties
of
pleasure
but
yet
blithe
and
beaming
her
countenance
fell
when
she
saw
her
sister
pale
face
margaret
how
you
look
cried
she
cold
wet
and
weary
and
ill
too
i
am
sure
cold
wet
and
weary
margaret
admitted
let
me
make
haste
to
bed
and
do
you
make
tea
for
edward
and
send
some
up
to
me
i
can
not
talk
now
edward
will
tell
you
tell
me
what
hester
asked
her
husband
when
she
found
that
margaret
had
really
rather
have
no
attendance
that
margaret
is
unhappy
love
from
some
misunderstanding
with
enderby
some
busy
devil
i
have
no
doubt
the
same
that
has
caused
so
much
mischief
already
has
come
between
him
and
margaret
he
then
told
the
story
of
philip
sudden
appearance
and
his
conduct
throughout
the
day
omitting
all
hint
that
any
conversation
with
himself
had
taken
place
he
hoped
in
conclusion
that
all
would
be
cleared
up
and
the
mutual
faith
of
the
lovers
restored
hester
thought
this
impossible
if
philip
could
be
prejudiced
against
margaret
by
any
man
or
woman
on
earth
or
any
devil
in
hell
there
must
be
an
instability
in
his
character
to
which
margaret
happiness
must
not
be
committed
hope
was
not
sure
of
this
there
were
circumstances
of
temptation
modes
of
delusion
under
which
the
faith
of
a
seraph
might
sink
but
worse
still
hester
said
was
his
conduct
of
torturing
margaret
affection
wounding
her
pride
insulting
her
cruelly
in
the
presence
of
all
those
among
whom
she
lived
hope
was
disposed
to
suspend
his
judgment
even
upon
this
enderby
was
evidently
his
love
was
undiminished
it
was
clear
it
was
the
soul
of
all
the
madness
of
margaret
had
conducted
herself
nobly
her
innocence
her
faith
must
triumph
at
last
they
might
bring
her
lover
to
her
side
again
hester
had
little
doubt
but
she
did
not
see
what
could
now
render
philip
worthy
of
margaret
this
had
always
been
her
apprehension
how
after
the
passions
of
this
day
could
they
ever
again
be
as
they
had
been
and
tears
as
gentle
and
sorrowful
as
margaret
had
ever
shed
for
her
now
rained
from
hester
eyes
be
comforted
my
hester
my
generous
wife
be
comforted
you
live
for
us
you
are
our
best
blessing
my
love
and
we
can
never
bear
to
see
you
suffer
for
her
be
comforted
and
wait
trust
that
the
retribution
of
this
will
fall
where
it
ought
and
that
will
never
be
upon
our
margaret
pray
that
the
retribution
may
fall
where
it
ought
and
that
its
bitterness
may
be
intense
as
the
joy
which
margaret
and
you
deserve
i
never
knew
you
so
revengeful
edward
said
his
wife
taking
the
hand
he
held
before
his
eyes
shall
i
admonish
you
for
once
shall
i
give
you
a
reproof
for
wishing
woe
to
our
enemies
shall
i
remind
you
to
forgive
fully
freely
as
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
yes
love
anything
for
the
hope
of
being
forgiven
ah
how
deep
your
sorrow
for
margaret
is
grief
always
humbles
us
in
our
own
eyes
such
humiliation
is
the
test
of
sorrow
bless
you
love
that
you
grieve
so
for
margaret
chapter
thirty
six
the
next
day
the
hours
of
a
sleepless
night
were
not
too
long
for
hope
to
revolve
what
he
must
say
and
do
on
the
morrow
he
must
meet
enderby
and
the
day
would
probably
decide
margaret
fate
that
this
decision
would
implicate
his
own
happiness
or
misery
was
a
subordinate
thought
it
was
not
till
after
he
had
viewed
margaret
case
in
every
light
in
which
apprehension
could
place
it
that
he
dwelt
upon
what
the
suffering
to
himself
must
be
of
seeing
margaret
day
by
day
living
on
in
meek
patience
amidst
the
destruction
of
hope
and
happiness
which
his
attachment
had
caused
when
he
did
dwell
upon
it
his
heart
sank
within
him
all
that
had
made
him
unhappy
seemed
of
late
to
have
passed
away
for
many
months
he
had
seen
margaret
satisfied
in
her
attachment
to
another
he
had
seen
hester
coming
out
nobly
from
the
trial
of
adversity
in
which
all
her
fine
qualities
had
been
exercised
and
her
weaknesses
almost
subdued
she
had
been
not
only
the
devoted
wife
but
patient
and
generous
towards
her
foes
full
of
faith
and
cheerfulness
in
her
temper
and
capable
of
any
degree
of
in
the
conduct
of
her
daily
life
she
had
been
of
late
all
that
in
the
days
of
their
engagement
in
the
days
when
he
had
dealt
falsely
with
his
own
mind
he
had
trusted
she
would
be
a
friendship
whose
tenderness
was
life
enough
for
them
both
had
grown
up
in
his
soul
and
he
had
been
at
peace
it
had
been
a
subject
of
incessant
thankfulness
to
him
that
the
evil
of
what
he
could
now
hardly
consider
as
a
false
step
had
been
confined
to
himself
that
his
struggles
his
strivings
the
dreadful
solitary
conflicts
of
a
few
months
had
not
been
in
vain
that
he
had
fulfilled
the
claims
of
both
relations
and
marred
no
one
peace
now
he
was
plunged
into
the
struggle
again
the
cause
was
at
an
end
but
consequences
of
perhaps
endless
wretchedness
remained
to
be
borne
his
secret
was
known
and
made
the
basis
of
untruths
to
which
the
whole
happiness
of
his
household
so
victoriously
struggled
for
so
carefully
cherished
by
him
and
so
lately
secured
must
be
sacrificed
again
and
again
he
turned
from
the
fearful
visions
of
margaret
cast
off
of
the
estrangement
of
the
sisters
of
the
possible
loss
of
some
of
their
fair
fame
from
these
harrowing
thoughts
he
turned
again
and
again
to
consider
what
must
be
the
most
certain
thing
was
that
he
must
not
by
word
look
pause
or
admission
countenance
to
enderby
himself
the
supposition
that
he
had
not
preferred
hester
at
the
time
she
became
his
wife
in
the
present
state
of
their
attachment
this
was
the
merest
justice
to
her
nothing
that
it
was
in
mrs
grey
power
to
reveal
bore
a
relation
to
any
time
later
than
his
early
and
it
might
be
assumed
superficial
intercourse
with
the
sisters
and
as
far
as
he
knew
no
one
else
unless
it
were
frank
by
this
time
in
possession
of
the
facts
had
ever
conceived
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
he
must
decline
all
question
about
his
domestic
relations
except
as
far
as
margaret
was
concerned
beyond
this
he
would
allow
of
no
inquisition
and
would
forbid
all
speculation
for
margaret
sake
no
less
than
hester
this
was
necessary
if
she
should
ever
be
enderby
wife
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
enderby
should
not
in
his
most
secret
soul
hold
this
information
however
strongly
he
might
be
convinced
that
margaret
was
in
ignorance
of
it
and
had
never
loved
any
but
himself
there
must
be
no
admission
to
enderby
of
that
which
had
been
truth
but
which
would
become
untruth
by
being
first
admitted
now
there
must
be
entire
silence
upon
the
whole
subject
of
as
to
margaret
he
did
not
see
what
could
be
done
but
to
declare
his
true
and
perfect
belief
that
she
had
never
loved
any
but
enderby
but
alas
what
chance
was
there
of
this
testimony
being
received
the
very
point
of
enderby
accusation
being
that
they
both
looked
perhaps
in
at
the
connection
with
him
as
their
security
from
the
consequences
of
weakness
in
marrying
hester
it
was
all
confused
all
wretched
all
nearly
hopeless
margaret
would
be
sacrificed
without
knowing
why
would
have
her
heart
wrung
with
the
sense
of
injury
in
addition
to
her
woe
from
reflections
and
anticipations
hope
rose
early
to
the
great
duty
of
the
day
he
told
hester
that
he
was
going
to
meet
enderby
in
the
meadows
to
receive
a
full
explanation
of
his
conduct
of
the
preceding
day
and
that
it
was
probable
that
he
should
bring
home
whatever
tidings
it
might
be
margaret
lot
to
hear
he
found
during
the
long
and
anxious
conversation
in
the
meadow
that
he
had
need
of
all
the
courage
calmness
and
discretion
he
could
command
it
was
a
cruel
trial
to
one
whose
wont
it
had
been
from
his
childhood
to
converse
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
it
was
a
cruel
trial
to
hear
evidence
upon
evidence
brought
of
what
he
knew
to
have
been
fact
and
to
find
connected
with
this
revolting
falsehoods
against
which
he
could
only
utter
the
indignation
of
his
soul
when
he
afterwards
reflected
how
artfully
the
facts
and
falsehoods
were
connected
he
could
no
longer
wonder
at
enderby
convictions
nor
at
the
conduct
which
proceeded
from
them
there
was
in
enderby
this
morning
no
undue
anger
no
contempt
which
could
excite
anger
in
another
no
doubt
cast
by
him
upon
hope
honour
or
margaret
purity
of
mind
as
the
world
esteems
purity
however
this
might
have
been
before
their
meeting
of
yesterday
it
was
now
clear
that
though
immoveably
convinced
of
their
mutual
attachment
he
supposed
it
to
have
been
entertained
as
innocently
as
it
was
formed
that
hope
had
been
wrought
upon
by
mrs
grey
and
by
a
consciousness
of
hester
love
that
he
had
married
from
a
false
sense
of
honour
and
then
discovered
his
mistake
that
he
had
striven
naturally
and
with
success
to
persuade
himself
that
margaret
loved
his
friend
while
margaret
had
made
the
same
effort
and
would
have
married
that
friend
for
security
and
with
the
hope
of
rest
in
a
home
of
her
own
with
one
whom
she
might
possibly
love
and
to
whom
she
was
bound
by
his
love
of
herself
as
for
the
evidence
on
which
his
belief
was
founded
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
it
hope
could
do
little
but
listen
to
the
detail
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
conduct
of
an
imputed
criminal
he
would
have
wrestled
with
the
evidence
obstinately
and
long
but
what
could
he
do
when
it
was
the
lover
of
his
who
was
declaring
why
his
confidence
in
her
was
gone
and
he
must
resume
his
plighted
faith
none
but
those
who
had
done
the
mischief
could
repair
it
and
least
of
all
hope
himself
he
could
only
make
one
single
solemn
protestation
of
his
belief
that
margaret
had
loved
none
but
enderby
and
deny
the
truth
of
every
statement
that
was
inconsistent
with
this
the
exhibition
of
the
evidence
showed
how
penetrating
how
sagacious
as
well
as
how
industrious
malice
can
be
there
seemed
to
be
no
circumstance
connected
with
the
sisters
and
their
relation
to
mr
hope
that
mrs
rowland
had
not
laid
hold
of
mrs
grey
visit
to
hope
during
his
convalescence
his
subsequent
seclusion
and
his
depression
when
he
reappeared
all
these
were
noted
and
it
was
these
which
sent
enderby
to
mrs
grey
for
an
explanation
which
she
had
not
had
courage
or
judgment
to
withhold
which
indeed
she
had
been
hurried
into
giving
she
had
admitted
all
that
had
passed
between
herself
and
mr
hope
his
consternation
at
finding
that
it
was
hester
who
loved
him
and
whom
he
must
marry
and
the
force
with
which
mrs
grey
had
felt
herself
obliged
to
urge
that
duty
upon
him
enderby
connected
with
this
his
own
observations
and
feelings
at
the
time
his
last
summer
conviction
that
it
was
margaret
whom
hope
loved
his
rapturous
surprise
on
hearing
of
the
engagement
being
to
hester
and
his
wonder
at
the
coldness
with
which
his
friend
received
his
congratulations
he
now
thought
that
he
must
have
been
doomed
to
blindness
not
to
have
discerned
the
truth
through
all
then
there
was
his
own
intrusion
during
the
interview
which
hope
had
with
margaret
their
countenances
had
haunted
him
ever
since
hope
was
full
of
constraint
and
anxiety
he
was
telling
his
intentions
margaret
face
was
downcast
and
her
attitude
motionless
she
was
hearing
her
then
after
hope
was
married
all
deerbrook
was
aware
of
his
failure
of
spirits
and
of
margaret
no
less
it
was
a
matter
of
common
remark
that
there
must
be
something
amiss
that
all
was
not
right
at
home
they
had
then
doubtless
discovered
that
the
attachment
was
mutual
and
they
might
well
be
those
who
ought
to
know
best
had
been
convinced
of
this
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
intercourse
mrs
rowland
had
met
at
cheltenham
a
young
officer
an
intimate
friend
of
mr
hope
family
who
would
not
be
persuaded
that
it
was
not
to
the
younger
sister
that
mr
hope
was
married
he
declared
that
he
knew
from
the
highest
authority
that
hope
was
attached
to
margaret
and
that
the
attachment
was
returned
it
was
not
till
mrs
rowland
had
shown
him
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
in
an
old
blickley
newspaper
which
she
happened
to
have
used
in
packing
her
trunk
that
he
would
believe
that
it
was
the
elder
sister
who
was
there
was
one
person
however
who
had
known
the
whole
enderby
said
perhaps
she
was
the
only
person
who
had
been
aware
of
it
all
and
that
was
his
mother
in
answer
to
hope
exclamations
upon
the
absurdity
of
this
enderby
said
that
a
thousand
circumstances
rose
up
to
confirm
mrs
statement
that
her
mother
had
known
all
and
had
learned
it
from
margaret
herself
margaret
had
confided
in
her
old
friend
as
in
a
mother
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
nothing
probably
more
necessary
to
an
overburdened
heart
this
explained
his
mother
never
having
shown
his
letters
to
margaret
the
person
for
whom
as
she
knew
they
were
chiefly
written
this
explained
the
words
of
concern
about
the
domestic
troubles
of
the
hopes
which
now
and
then
during
her
long
confinement
she
had
dropped
in
phoebe
hearing
and
even
in
her
letters
to
her
son
she
had
repeatedly
regretted
that
margaret
would
not
leave
her
sister
house
and
return
to
birmingham
saying
that
income
and
convenience
were
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
in
comparison
with
some
other
considerations
in
fact
she
had
it
was
weakness
perhaps
but
one
not
to
be
too
hardly
judged
under
the
circumstances
she
had
revealed
the
whole
to
her
daughter
under
injunctions
to
secrecy
which
had
been
strictly
observed
while
she
lived
and
broken
now
only
for
a
brother
sake
and
after
a
long
conflict
between
obligations
apparently
contradictory
when
from
her
deathbed
she
had
welcomed
margaret
as
a
it
was
in
the
gratitude
which
it
was
natural
for
a
mother
to
feel
on
finding
the
attachment
of
an
only
son
at
length
appreciated
and
rewarded
when
she
had
implored
mrs
rowland
to
receive
margaret
as
a
sister
and
had
seen
them
embrace
her
generous
spirit
had
rejoiced
in
her
young
conquest
of
an
unhappy
passion
and
she
had
meant
to
convey
to
priscilla
an
admonition
to
bury
in
oblivion
what
had
become
known
to
her
and
to
forgive
margaret
for
having
loved
any
one
but
philip
priscilla
could
not
make
a
difficulty
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
presence
she
had
submitted
to
the
embrace
but
her
soul
had
recoiled
from
it
she
had
actually
fainted
under
the
shock
and
ever
since
she
had
declared
to
her
brother
with
a
pertinacity
which
he
had
been
unable
to
understand
which
indeed
had
looked
like
sheer
audacity
that
he
would
never
marry
margaret
ibbotson
philip
was
now
convinced
that
he
had
done
his
sister
much
wrong
her
temper
and
conduct
were
in
some
instances
indefensible
but
since
he
had
learned
all
this
and
become
aware
how
much
of
what
he
had
censured
had
been
said
and
done
out
of
affection
for
himself
he
had
been
disposed
rather
to
blame
her
for
the
lateness
of
her
explanations
than
for
any
excess
of
zeal
on
his
account
zeal
which
he
admitted
had
carried
her
a
point
or
two
beyond
the
truth
in
some
of
her
aims
these
statements
about
the
condition
of
margaret
mind
were
borne
out
by
circumstances
known
to
others
when
margaret
had
been
rescued
from
drowning
hope
was
heard
to
breathe
as
he
bent
over
her
oh
god
my
margaret
and
it
was
observed
that
she
rallied
instantly
on
hearing
the
exclamation
and
repaid
him
with
a
look
worthy
of
his
words
this
had
been
admitted
to
enderby
himself
by
the
one
who
heard
it
and
who
might
be
trusted
to
speak
of
it
to
no
one
else
then
it
was
known
that
when
margaret
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
long
walks
alone
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
she
was
met
occasionally
by
her
in
his
rides
naturally
enough
their
conversation
had
been
overheard
once
at
least
when
they
consulted
about
the
peace
of
their
home
how
much
of
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
they
should
communicate
to
mrs
hope
and
whether
or
not
mr
enderby
was
engaged
to
a
lady
abroad
without
these
testimonies
enderby
felt
that
he
had
only
to
recur
to
his
own
experience
to
be
convinced
that
margaret
had
never
loved
him
though
striving
to
persuade
herself
as
well
as
him
that
she
did
the
calmness
with
which
she
had
received
his
avowals
that
first
evening
last
winter
struck
him
with
admiration
at
the
time
he
now
understood
it
better
he
wondered
he
had
felt
so
little
till
now
the
coldness
of
the
tone
of
her
correspondence
the
first
thing
which
awakened
him
to
an
admission
of
it
was
her
refusal
to
marry
him
in
the
spring
she
shrank
as
she
avowed
from
leaving
her
present
residence
she
might
have
said
from
quitting
those
she
loved
best
it
was
clear
that
in
marrying
she
was
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
duty
to
secure
innocence
and
safety
for
herself
and
those
who
were
dearest
to
her
and
that
when
the
time
drew
near
she
recoiled
from
the
effort
enderby
was
thankful
that
all
had
become
clear
in
time
for
her
release
and
his
own
the
horror
with
which
hope
listened
to
this
was
beyond
what
he
had
prepared
himself
for
beyond
all
that
he
had
yet
endured
enderby
seemed
quite
willing
to
hear
him
but
what
could
be
said
only
that
which
he
had
planned
his
protest
against
the
truth
of
certain
of
the
statements
and
the
justice
of
some
of
the
constructions
of
facts
was
strong
he
declared
that
in
his
perfect
satisfaction
with
his
domestic
state
his
happiness
with
his
beloved
and
honoured
wife
he
would
admit
of
no
question
about
his
family
affairs
as
far
as
he
and
hester
were
concerned
he
denied
at
once
and
for
ever
all
that
went
to
show
that
margaret
had
for
a
moment
regarded
him
otherwise
than
as
a
friend
and
a
brother
and
declared
that
the
bare
mention
to
her
of
the
idea
which
was
uppermost
in
enderby
mind
would
be
a
cruelty
and
insult
which
could
never
be
retrieved
he
was
not
going
to
plead
for
her
bitterly
as
she
must
suffer
it
was
from
a
cause
which
lay
too
deep
for
cure
from
a
want
of
faith
in
her
in
one
who
ought
to
know
her
best
but
from
whom
she
would
be
henceforth
best
separated
if
what
he
had
been
saying
was
his
deliberate
belief
and
enderby
declaring
that
it
was
so
and
that
it
was
his
intention
to
release
margaret
from
her
engagement
gently
and
carefully
without
useless
explanation
and
without
reproach
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
done
hope
prophesied
in
parting
that
of
all
the
days
of
enderby
life
this
was
perhaps
that
of
which
he
would
one
day
most
heartily
repent
and
while
he
spoke
he
felt
that
this
same
day
was
the
one
which
he
might
himself
find
the
most
difficult
to
endure
he
left
enderby
still
pacing
the
meadow
and
walked
homewards
with
a
heart
weighed
down
with
grief
a
grief
which
yet
he
would
fain
have
increased
to
any
degree
of
intensity
by
taking
margaret
upon
himself
margaret
was
at
the
with
her
sister
when
he
entered
her
eyes
were
swollen
but
her
manner
was
gentle
and
composed
she
looked
up
at
edward
when
he
appeared
with
an
expression
of
timid
expectation
in
her
face
which
went
to
his
soul
a
few
words
passed
a
very
few
and
then
no
more
was
said
yes
i
have
seen
him
he
is
very
wretched
he
will
not
come
but
we
shall
hear
something
i
have
no
doubt
a
strange
persuasion
which
i
can
not
remove
of
a
prior
attachment
of
a
want
of
frankness
and
confidence
he
will
explain
himself
presently
but
his
persuasion
is
irremoveable
hester
had
much
to
say
of
him
out
of
her
throbbing
heart
but
she
looked
at
margaret
and
restrained
herself
what
must
there
be
in
heart
to
utter
one
word
would
be
irreverent
the
breakfast
passed
in
an
almost
unbroken
silence
it
had
not
been
long
over
when
the
expected
letter
came
hope
never
saw
it
but
there
was
no
need
he
perfectly
anticipated
its
contents
while
to
her
for
whom
they
were
written
they
were
incomprehensible
i
spare
you
and
myself
the
misery
of
an
interview
it
must
be
agonising
to
you
and
there
would
be
dishonour
as
well
as
pain
to
me
in
witnessing
that
agony
if
as
i
fully
believe
you
have
been
hitherto
blind
to
the
injustice
of
your
connecting
yourself
with
me
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
expediency
when
you
had
not
a
first
genuine
love
to
give
i
think
you
will
see
it
now
and
i
pity
your
suffering
in
the
discovery
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
i
wish
or
intend
to
hang
any
reproach
why
did
you
not
when
i
had
become
entitled
to
your
confidence
lay
your
heart
fully
open
to
me
did
i
not
do
so
by
you
did
i
not
reveal
to
you
even
the
transient
fancy
which
i
entertained
long
ago
and
which
i
showed
my
faith
in
you
her
friend
by
revealing
if
you
had
only
done
the
same
if
you
had
only
let
me
know
without
a
hint
as
to
the
object
that
you
had
been
attached
and
that
you
believed
i
might
succeed
to
your
affections
in
time
if
you
had
done
this
i
do
not
say
that
we
should
then
have
been
what
i
so
lately
trusted
we
were
to
be
for
my
soul
is
jealous
has
been
made
so
by
what
i
thought
you
and
will
bear
none
but
a
first
and
an
entire
and
an
exclusive
love
but
in
that
case
i
should
have
cherished
you
in
my
inmost
heart
as
all
that
i
have
believed
you
to
be
though
not
destined
for
me
but
i
do
not
blame
you
you
have
done
what
you
meant
to
be
right
though
from
too
great
regard
to
one
set
of
considerations
you
have
mistaken
the
right
and
have
sacrificed
me
i
make
allowance
for
your
difficulty
and
for
my
own
part
pardon
you
and
testify
most
sincerely
and
earnestly
to
the
purity
of
your
mind
and
intentions
do
not
reject
this
parting
testimony
i
offer
it
because
i
would
not
have
you
think
me
harsh
or
suppose
that
passion
has
made
me
unjust
i
love
you
too
deeply
to
do
more
than
mourn
i
have
no
heart
to
blame
except
for
your
want
of
confidence
of
that
i
have
a
right
to
complain
but
for
the
rest
spare
yourself
the
effort
of
it
is
not
needed
i
do
not
accuse
you
you
were
right
in
saying
yesterday
that
i
love
you
still
i
shall
ever
love
you
be
our
separate
lives
what
they
may
god
bless
you
pe
will
you
not
wait
my
dearest
margaret
said
hester
when
within
half
an
hour
of
the
arrival
of
enderby
letter
she
met
her
sister
on
the
stairs
with
the
reply
in
her
hand
sealed
and
ready
to
be
sent
why
such
haste
the
events
of
your
life
may
hang
on
this
day
on
this
one
letter
can
it
be
right
to
be
so
rapid
in
what
you
think
and
do
the
event
of
my
life
is
decided
she
replied
unless
no
the
event
of
my
life
decided
i
have
nothing
more
to
wait
for
i
have
written
what
i
think
and
it
must
go
it
was
as
follows
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
reply
to
your
letter
for
i
can
not
understand
it
yet
i
wonder
less
at
your
letter
than
at
your
having
written
it
instead
of
coming
to
me
to
say
all
that
is
in
your
mind
at
some
moments
i
still
think
that
you
will
i
feel
that
you
are
on
your
way
hither
and
i
fancy
that
this
dreadful
dream
of
your
displeasure
will
pass
away
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
any
one
has
been
seriously
and
lastingly
displeased
with
me
and
though
i
feel
that
i
have
not
deserved
it
i
am
very
wretched
that
you
of
all
others
should
blame
me
and
cease
to
trust
me
there
ought
to
be
some
comfort
in
the
thought
that
your
anger
is
without
cause
but
i
can
not
find
such
comfort
for
i
feel
that
though
i
could
endure
your
loss
by
long
absence
or
death
i
can
not
live
in
the
spirit
in
which
i
should
wish
to
live
without
your
esteem
it
is
useless
alas
to
entreat
of
you
to
come
and
explain
yourself
or
in
some
other
way
to
put
me
in
possession
of
the
cause
of
your
anger
if
you
could
resist
the
claims
i
had
upon
you
for
confidence
before
i
knew
what
was
going
to
befall
me
if
you
could
resist
the
demand
i
made
yesterday
i
fear
there
is
little
use
in
imploring
you
to
do
me
justice
if
i
thought
there
was
any
chance
i
would
submit
to
entreat
though
i
would
not
have
you
any
more
than
myself
forget
that
i
have
a
right
to
demand
but
indeed
i
would
yield
everything
that
i
dare
forego
to
have
you
awakened
from
this
strange
delusion
which
makes
us
both
wretched
it
is
no
time
for
pride
now
i
care
not
how
fully
you
know
what
i
feel
i
only
wish
that
you
could
see
into
my
soul
as
into
your
own
for
then
you
would
not
misjudge
me
as
you
do
i
care
not
what
any
one
may
think
of
my
throwing
myself
upon
the
love
which
i
am
certain
you
feel
for
me
if
i
can
only
persuade
you
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
and
to
hear
what
i
shall
then
have
to
say
what
can
i
now
say
i
will
not
reproach
you
for
i
know
you
must
be
even
if
possible
more
miserable
than
i
but
yet
how
can
i
help
feeling
that
you
have
been
unjust
and
harsh
with
me
yes
though
the
tone
of
your
letter
seems
to
be
gentle
and
you
clearly
mean
it
to
be
so
i
feel
that
you
have
been
very
harsh
to
me
nothing
that
you
can
do
shall
ever
make
me
so
cruel
to
you
you
may
rest
satisfied
that
if
we
should
not
meet
again
i
will
never
be
unjust
to
you
to
every
one
about
me
it
will
appear
that
you
are
fickle
and
dishonourable
that
you
have
acted
towards
me
as
it
is
in
the
nature
of
some
men
to
act
towards
the
women
whose
affections
they
possess
in
the
nature
of
some
men
but
not
in
yours
i
know
you
to
be
incapable
of
anything
worse
than
error
and
mistrust
and
till
yesterday
i
could
not
have
believed
you
capable
of
this
much
wrong
and
you
may
trust
me
to
impute
to
you
nothing
worse
than
this
suffering
as
i
now
am
as
we
both
are
under
this
error
and
mistrust
may
i
not
implore
you
for
your
own
sake
for
mine
it
is
too
late
to
nourish
the
weak
part
of
yourself
to
question
your
own
unworthy
doubts
and
to
study
the
best
parts
of
the
minds
you
meet
till
you
grow
assured
as
a
religious
man
ought
to
be
that
there
can
be
no
and
much
less
falsehood
mixed
up
with
any
real
affection
with
any
such
affection
as
has
existed
between
us
two
i
must
not
write
more
for
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
conjecture
how
you
may
receive
what
i
have
written
thinking
of
me
as
you
now
do
it
seems
strange
to
remember
that
at
this
time
yesterday
in
this
very
chair
i
was
writing
to
you
oh
how
differently
is
it
possible
that
it
was
only
yesterday
such
a
world
of
misery
as
we
have
lived
through
since
but
i
can
write
no
more
it
may
be
that
you
will
despise
me
in
every
line
as
you
read
after
what
has
happened
i
can
not
tell
notwithstanding
all
i
have
said
about
trusting
i
feel
at
this
moment
as
if
i
could
never
depend
on
anything
in
this
world
again
if
you
should
come
within
this
hour
and
explain
all
how
could
i
be
sure
that
the
same
thing
might
not
happen
again
but
do
not
let
this
weigh
a
moment
with
you
if
indeed
you
think
of
coming
if
i
do
not
see
you
i
shall
never
see
you
i
will
then
bear
in
mind
as
you
desire
and
as
i
can
not
help
that
you
love
me
still
but
how
little
comfort
is
there
in
such
love
when
trust
is
gone
god
comfort
us
both
margaret
ibbotson
mrs
rowland
was
crossing
the
hall
at
the
moment
that
her
maid
betsy
opened
the
door
to
mr
hope
and
took
in
this
letter
where
are
you
carrying
that
letter
said
she
as
betsy
passed
her
to
the
study
against
mr
enderby
comes
in
it
is
for
mr
enderby
very
well
the
letter
was
placed
on
the
study
mantelpiece
the
place
of
deposit
for
letters
for
absent
members
of
the
family
mrs
rowland
meantime
resumed
her
seat
in
the
where
the
nursemaid
was
amusing
the
baby
mamma
took
the
baby
and
sent
the
maid
away
she
had
a
strong
belief
that
her
brother
might
be
found
somewhere
in
the
shrubbery
though
some
feeling
had
prevented
her
telling
the
servant
so
when
the
letter
was
taken
in
she
went
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
into
the
study
to
see
whether
philip
was
visible
in
any
part
of
the
garden
that
could
be
seen
thence
but
she
stopped
short
of
the
window
the
handwriting
on
the
address
of
the
letter
troubled
her
sight
more
than
as
she
was
of
the
truth
of
much
that
she
had
told
her
brother
strenuously
as
she
had
nourished
the
few
facts
she
was
in
possession
of
till
she
had
made
them
yield
a
double
crop
of
inferences
she
was
yet
conscious
of
large
exaggerations
of
what
she
knew
and
of
huge
additions
to
what
she
believed
to
be
probabilities
and
had
delivered
as
facts
there
was
in
that
handwriting
a
prophecy
of
detection
and
like
other
cowards
she
began
to
tamper
with
her
reason
and
conscience
there
is
great
mischief
in
letters
at
such
times
she
thought
they
are
so
difficult
to
answer
and
it
is
so
possible
to
produce
any
effect
that
may
be
wished
by
them
as
my
husband
was
reading
the
other
day
is
so
easy
to
be
virtuous
to
be
perfect
upon
paper
nothing
that
the
girl
can
say
ought
to
alter
the
state
of
the
case
it
can
only
harass
philip
feelings
and
perhaps
cause
all
the
work
to
be
gone
over
again
his
letter
was
meant
to
be
final
i
am
confident
from
his
intending
to
go
away
this
evening
there
should
have
been
no
answer
this
letter
is
a
pure
impertinence
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
such
it
is
a
sort
of
duty
to
use
it
as
it
deserves
many
parents
at
least
i
know
old
mr
boyle
did
burn
letters
which
they
know
to
contain
offers
to
daughters
whom
they
do
not
wish
to
part
with
mr
boyle
had
no
scruple
and
i
am
sure
this
is
a
stronger
case
better
end
the
whole
affair
at
once
and
then
philip
will
be
free
to
form
a
better
connection
he
will
thank
me
one
day
for
having
broken
off
this
she
carried
the
letter
into
the
slowly
contemplating
it
as
she
went
she
thought
for
one
fleeting
instant
of
reading
it
she
was
not
withheld
by
honour
but
by
fear
she
shrank
from
encountering
its
contents
she
glanced
over
the
mantelpiece
and
saw
that
the
were
at
hand
to
make
the
letter
burn
quickly
it
was
necessary
to
unfold
it
she
put
the
child
down
upon
the
rug
a
favourite
for
the
sake
of
the
gay
pink
and
green
shavings
which
at
this
time
of
the
year
curtained
the
grate
while
baby
crawled
and
gazed
quietly
and
contentedly
there
mrs
rowland
broke
the
seal
of
margaret
letter
turning
her
eyes
from
the
writing
laid
the
blistered
sheet
in
the
hearth
and
set
fire
to
it
the
child
set
up
a
loud
crow
of
delight
at
the
flame
at
that
moment
even
this
simple
and
familiar
sound
startled
its
mother
out
of
all
power
of
she
snatched
up
the
child
with
a
vehemence
which
frightened
it
into
a
shrill
cry
she
feared
the
nursemaid
would
come
before
all
the
sparks
were
out
and
she
tried
to
quiet
the
baby
by
dancing
it
before
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
she
met
her
own
face
there
white
as
ashes
and
the
child
saw
nothing
that
could
amuse
it
while
its
eyes
were
blinded
with
tears
she
opened
the
window
to
let
it
hearken
to
the
church
clock
and
the
device
was
effectual
baby
composed
its
face
to
serious
listening
before
the
long
succession
of
strokes
was
finished
and
allowed
the
tears
to
be
wiped
from
its
cheeks
one
thing
more
remained
to
be
done
mrs
rowland
heard
a
step
in
the
hall
and
looked
out
it
was
betsy
i
thought
it
was
you
pray
desire
cook
to
send
up
a
cup
of
broth
for
miss
rowland
lunch
and
be
sure
and
let
miss
rowland
know
the
moment
it
is
ready
mr
enderby
is
in
the
shrubbery
i
think
yes
seeing
he
was
there
i
was
coming
to
ask
about
the
letter
to
carry
it
to
him
oh
that
letter
i
sent
it
to
him
he
has
got
it
tell
cook
directly
about
the
broth
at
one
of
the
children
was
desired
to
summon
uncle
philip
mrs
rowland
took
care
to
meet
him
at
the
garden
door
she
saw
him
cast
a
wistful
eye
towards
the
study
mantelpiece
as
he
passed
the
open
door
his
sister
observed
that
she
believed
it
was
past
post
time
for
this
he
sighed
deeply
and
she
felt
that
no
sigh
of
his
had
ever
so
gone
to
her
heart
before
why
mamma
do
look
cried
george
as
well
as
a
mouthful
of
bread
would
allow
look
at
the
chimney
where
are
all
the
shavings
gone
there
is
the
knot
at
the
top
that
they
were
tied
together
with
but
not
a
bit
of
shaving
left
have
they
blown
up
the
chimney
what
will
poor
baby
say
exclaimed
matilda
all
the
pretty
pink
and
green
gone
there
is
some
tinder
blowing
about
observed
george
i
do
believe
they
have
been
burnt
shut
the
window
george
will
you
there
is
no
bearing
this
draught
there
is
no
bearing
betsy
waste
either
she
has
burned
those
shavings
somehow
in
cleaning
the
grate
her
carelessness
is
past
endurance
make
her
buy
some
new
shavings
mamma
for
baby
sake
do
be
quiet
and
get
your
lunch
hand
your
uncle
the
dish
of
currants
philip
languidly
picked
a
few
bunches
he
had
noticed
nothing
that
had
passed
as
his
sister
was
glad
to
observe
besides
being
too
much
accustomed
to
hear
complaints
of
the
servants
to
give
any
heed
to
them
he
was
now
engrossed
with
his
own
wretched
thoughts
every
five
minutes
that
passed
without
bringing
a
reply
from
margaret
went
to
confirm
his
most
painful
impressions
margaret
meantime
was
sitting
alone
in
her
chamber
enduring
the
long
morning
as
she
best
might
now
plying
her
needle
as
if
life
depended
on
her
industry
and
now
throwing
up
her
employment
in
disgust
she
listened
for
the
one
sound
she
needed
to
hear
till
her
soul
was
sick
of
every
other
i
must
live
wholly
within
myself
now
she
thought
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
i
can
never
speak
of
him
or
allow
hester
and
maria
to
speak
of
him
to
me
for
they
will
blame
him
every
one
will
blame
him
maria
did
yesterday
no
one
will
do
him
justice
i
can
not
ask
mrs
grey
as
i
intended
anything
of
what
she
may
have
seen
and
heard
about
all
this
i
have
had
my
joy
to
myself
i
have
carried
about
my
solitary
glory
and
bliss
in
his
being
mine
and
now
i
must
live
alone
upon
my
grief
for
him
for
no
one
person
in
the
world
will
pity
and
justify
him
but
myself
he
has
done
me
no
wrong
that
he
could
help
his
staying
away
is
to
save
me
pain
as
he
thinks
i
wish
i
had
not
said
in
my
letter
that
he
has
been
harsh
to
me
perhaps
he
would
have
been
here
by
this
time
if
i
had
not
said
that
how
afraid
he
was
that
day
in
the
spring
when
he
urged
me
so
to
marry
at
once
oh
if
i
had
all
this
would
have
been
saved
and
yet
i
thought
and
i
still
think
i
was
right
but
how
afraid
he
was
of
our
parting
lest
evil
should
come
between
us
i
promised
him
it
should
not
for
my
own
part
but
who
could
have
thought
that
the
mistrust
would
be
on
his
side
he
had
a
superstitious
feeling
he
said
that
something
would
happen
that
we
should
be
parted
and
i
would
not
hear
of
it
how
presumptuous
i
was
how
did
i
dare
to
make
so
light
of
what
has
come
so
dreadfully
true
oh
why
are
we
so
made
that
we
can
not
see
into
one
hearts
if
we
are
made
to
depend
on
one
another
so
absolutely
as
we
are
so
that
we
hold
one
another
peace
to
cherish
or
to
crush
why
is
it
such
a
blind
dependence
why
are
we
left
so
helpless
why
with
so
many
powers
as
are
given
us
have
we
not
that
one
other
worth
all
the
rest
of
mutual
insight
if
god
would
bestow
this
power
for
this
one
day
i
would
give
up
all
else
for
it
for
ever
after
philip
would
trust
me
again
then
and
i
should
understand
him
and
i
could
rest
afterwards
happen
what
might
though
then
nothing
would
happen
but
what
was
good
but
now
shut
in
each
into
ourselves
with
anger
and
sorrow
all
about
us
from
some
mistake
which
a
moment
insight
might
remove
it
is
the
dreariest
the
most
tormenting
state
what
are
all
the
locks
and
bars
and
fetters
in
the
world
to
it
so
near
each
other
too
when
one
look
one
tone
might
perhaps
lead
to
the
clearing
up
of
it
all
there
is
no
occasion
to
bear
this
however
so
near
as
we
are
nothing
should
prevent
our
meeting
nothing
shall
prevent
it
she
started
up
and
hastily
put
on
her
bonnet
and
gloves
but
when
her
hand
was
on
the
lock
of
her
door
her
heart
misgave
her
if
it
should
fail
she
thought
if
he
should
neither
look
at
me
nor
speak
to
me
if
he
should
leave
me
as
he
did
yesterday
i
should
never
get
over
the
shame
i
dare
not
store
up
such
a
wretched
remembrance
to
make
me
miserable
as
often
as
i
think
of
it
for
as
long
as
i
live
if
he
will
not
come
after
reading
my
letter
neither
would
he
hear
me
if
i
went
to
him
oh
he
is
very
unjust
after
all
his
feats
of
my
being
influenced
against
him
he
might
have
distrusted
himself
after
making
me
promise
to
write
on
the
first
doubt
that
any
one
might
try
to
put
into
my
mind
he
might
have
remembered
to
do
the
same
by
me
instead
of
coming
down
in
this
way
not
to
explain
but
to
overwhelm
me
with
his
displeasure
without
giving
me
a
moment
time
to
justify
myself
edward
seems
strangely
unkind
too
she
sighed
as
she
slowly
untied
her
bonnet
and
put
it
away
as
if
to
avoid
tempting
herself
with
the
sight
of
it
again
i
never
knew
edward
unjust
or
unkind
before
but
i
heard
him
ask
philip
why
he
staid
to
hear
me
in
the
abbey
yesterday
and
though
he
has
been
with
philip
this
morning
he
does
not
seem
to
have
made
the
slightest
attempt
to
bring
us
together
when
such
as
edward
and
philip
do
so
wrong
one
does
not
know
where
to
trust
or
what
to
hope
there
is
nothing
to
trust
but
god
and
the
right
i
will
live
for
these
and
no
one
shall
henceforth
hear
me
complain
or
see
me
droop
or
know
anything
of
what
lies
deepest
in
my
heart
this
must
be
possible
it
has
been
done
many
nuns
in
their
convents
have
carried
it
through
and
missionaries
in
heathen
countries
and
all
the
wisest
who
have
been
before
their
age
and
some
say
maria
would
say
almost
every
person
who
has
loved
as
i
have
but
i
do
not
believe
this
i
do
not
believe
that
many
that
any
can
have
felt
as
i
do
now
it
is
not
natural
and
right
that
any
should
live
as
i
mean
to
do
we
are
made
for
confidence
not
for
such
solitude
and
concealment
but
it
may
be
done
when
circumstances
press
as
they
do
upon
me
and
if
god
gives
me
strength
i
will
do
it
i
will
live
for
him
and
his
and
my
heart
let
it
suffer
as
it
may
shall
never
complain
to
human
ear
it
shall
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
the
resolution
held
for
some
hours
margaret
was
quiet
and
composed
through
dinner
though
her
expectation
instead
of
dying
out
grew
more
intense
with
every
hour
after
dinner
hope
urged
his
wife
to
walk
with
him
it
had
been
a
fine
day
and
she
had
not
been
out
there
was
still
another
hour
before
dark
would
not
margaret
go
too
no
margaret
could
not
leave
home
when
hester
came
down
equipped
for
her
walk
she
sat
beside
her
sister
on
the
sofa
for
a
minute
or
two
while
waiting
for
edward
margaret
said
she
will
you
let
me
say
one
word
to
you
anything
hester
if
you
will
not
be
hard
upon
any
one
whom
you
can
not
fully
understand
i
would
not
for
the
world
be
hard
love
but
there
was
once
a
time
above
a
year
ago
when
you
warned
me
kindly
warned
me
though
i
did
not
receive
it
kindly
against
pride
as
a
support
you
said
it
could
not
support
me
and
you
said
truly
may
i
say
the
same
to
you
now
thank
you
it
is
kind
of
you
i
will
consider
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
any
pride
in
me
i
feel
humbled
enough
it
is
not
for
you
to
feel
humbled
love
reverence
yourself
for
you
may
nothing
has
happened
to
impair
your
admit
freely
to
your
own
mind
and
to
us
that
you
have
been
cruelly
injured
and
that
you
suffer
as
you
must
and
ought
admit
this
freely
and
then
rely
on
yourself
and
us
margaret
shook
her
head
she
did
not
say
it
but
she
felt
that
she
could
not
rely
on
edward
while
he
seemed
to
stand
between
her
and
philip
he
came
in
at
the
moment
and
she
averted
her
eyes
from
him
he
felt
her
displeasure
in
his
heart
core
when
they
returned
sooner
than
she
had
expected
from
their
walk
they
had
bad
news
for
her
which
they
had
agreed
it
was
most
merciful
not
to
delay
they
had
seen
enderby
in
mr
rowland
gig
on
the
blickley
road
he
had
his
with
him
and
mr
rowland
man
was
undoubtedly
driving
him
to
blickley
to
meet
the
night
coach
for
london
it
is
better
to
save
you
all
further
useless
expectation
observed
edward
we
keep
nothing
from
you
you
keep
nothing
from
me
said
margaret
now
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
then
what
is
your
reason
for
not
having
brought
us
together
if
indeed
you
have
not
kept
us
apart
do
you
suppose
i
did
not
hear
you
send
him
from
me
yesterday
and
how
do
i
know
that
you
have
not
kept
him
away
my
dear
margaret
exclaimed
hester
but
a
look
from
her
husband
and
the
recollection
of
margaret
misery
silenced
her
for
the
first
time
hester
forgave
on
the
instant
the
act
of
blaming
her
husband
whatever
i
have
done
whether
it
appears
clear
to
you
or
not
replied
hope
it
is
from
the
most
tender
respect
for
your
feelings
i
shall
always
respect
them
most
tenderly
and
not
the
less
for
their
being
hurt
with
me
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
meaning
all
that
is
kind
edward
but
surely
when
two
people
misunderstand
each
other
it
is
best
that
they
should
meet
if
you
have
acted
from
a
regard
to
what
you
consider
my
dignity
i
could
wish
that
you
had
left
the
charge
of
it
to
myself
you
are
right
quite
right
then
why
oh
edward
if
you
repent
what
you
have
done
it
may
not
yet
be
too
late
i
do
not
repent
i
have
done
you
no
wrong
margaret
i
grieve
for
you
but
i
could
not
have
helped
you
let
us
never
speak
on
this
subject
again
said
margaret
stung
by
the
consciousness
of
having
so
soon
broken
the
resolution
of
the
morning
that
her
suffering
heart
should
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
it
is
not
from
pride
hester
that
i
say
so
but
let
us
never
again
speak
of
all
this
let
us
know
but
one
thing
margaret
said
edward
that
yours
is
the
generous
silence
of
forgiveness
i
do
not
mean
with
regard
to
him
for
i
fear
you
will
forgive
him
sooner
than
we
can
do
i
do
not
mean
him
particularly
nor
those
who
have
poisoned
his
ear
but
all
only
tell
us
that
your
silence
is
the
oblivion
of
mercy
so
mourning
for
the
erring
that
for
its
own
sake
it
remembers
their
transgressions
no
more
margaret
looked
up
at
them
both
though
her
eyes
swam
in
tears
there
was
a
smile
upon
her
lips
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
brother
and
yielded
herself
to
hester
kiss
chapter
thirty
seven
the
conqueror
mrs
rowland
did
not
find
herself
much
the
happier
for
being
borne
out
by
the
whole
world
in
her
assertions
that
philip
and
margaret
were
not
engaged
she
knew
that
with
regard
to
this
she
now
stood
justified
in
the
eyes
of
all
deerbrook
that
almost
everyone
there
now
believed
that
it
had
been
an
entanglement
from
which
she
had
released
her
brother
from
selfish
fear
from
dread
of
the
consequences
of
going
so
far
as
to
be
again
sent
by
her
husband
to
cheltenham
or
by
the
levitts
to
coventry
from
foresight
of
the
results
which
would
ensue
from
her
provoking
an
inquiry
into
the
domestic
concerns
of
the
hopes
an
inquiry
which
might
end
in
the
reconciliation
of
philip
and
margaret
and
in
some
unpleasant
discoveries
about
herself
she
was
very
guarded
respecting
the
grand
accusation
by
which
she
had
wrought
on
her
brother
no
hint
of
it
got
abroad
in
deerbrook
nothing
was
added
to
the
ancient
gossip
about
the
hopes
not
being
very
happy
together
mrs
rowland
knew
that
affairs
stood
in
this
satisfactory
state
she
knew
that
margaret
was
exposed
to
as
much
observation
and
inquiry
as
a
country
village
affords
respecting
her
disappointed
attachment
that
the
greys
were
very
angry
and
praised
margaret
to
every
person
they
met
that
mr
walcot
eulogised
mrs
rowland
discernment
to
all
mrs
party
that
mrs
howell
and
miss
miskin
lifted
up
their
eyes
in
thankfulness
at
mr
enderby
escape
from
such
a
connection
that
mr
hope
was
reported
to
be
rather
flat
in
spirits
and
that
margaret
was
certainly
looking
thin
she
knew
of
all
this
success
and
yet
she
was
not
happier
than
six
months
ago
the
drawback
on
such
successes
is
that
they
are
never
complete
there
is
always
some
mordecai
sitting
at
the
gate
to
mar
the
enjoyment
mrs
rowland
was
aware
of
mrs
james
having
dropped
that
she
and
her
husband
had
nothing
to
do
with
family
quarrels
that
there
was
always
a
great
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
in
such
cases
and
that
they
had
never
seen
anything
but
what
was
amiable
and
pleasant
in
miss
ibbotson
and
her
connections
she
knew
that
dr
levitt
called
on
the
hopes
full
as
often
as
at
any
house
in
deerbrook
and
that
mrs
levitt
had
offered
to
take
some
of
plants
into
her
greenhouse
to
be
nursed
through
the
winter
she
was
always
hearing
that
miss
young
and
margaret
were
much
together
and
that
they
were
happy
in
each
other
society
and
she
alternately
fancied
them
talking
about
her
exposing
to
each
other
the
injuries
she
had
wrought
to
both
and
enjoying
an
oblivion
of
their
cares
in
her
despite
she
could
never
see
maria
taking
an
airing
in
the
greys
shrubbery
leaning
on
margaret
arm
or
margaret
turning
in
at
the
farrier
gate
without
feeling
her
colour
rise
she
knew
that
mr
jones
was
apt
to
accommodate
miss
ibbotson
with
a
choice
of
meat
in
preference
to
his
other
customers
and
that
mrs
jones
had
spoken
indignantly
to
a
neighbour
about
fine
gentlemen
from
london
that
think
little
of
breaking
one
young
heart
after
another
to
please
their
own
vanity
and
never
come
back
to
look
upon
the
eyes
that
they
have
made
dim
and
the
cheeks
that
grow
pale
for
them
all
these
things
mrs
rowland
knew
and
they
ate
into
her
heart
in
these
days
of
her
triumph
she
moved
about
in
fear
and
no
hour
passed
without
troubling
her
victory
she
felt
that
she
could
not
rest
till
the
family
was
got
rid
of
they
did
not
seem
disposed
to
move
of
their
own
accord
she
incessantly
expressed
her
scorn
of
the
want
of
spirit
of
a
professional
man
who
would
live
on
in
a
place
where
he
had
lost
his
practice
and
where
a
rival
was
daily
rising
upon
his
ruins
but
the
hopes
staid
on
still
week
after
week
they
were
to
be
met
in
the
lanes
and
meadows
now
gleaning
in
the
wake
of
the
with
fanny
and
mary
for
the
benefit
of
widow
rye
now
blackberry
gathering
in
the
fields
now
nutting
in
the
hedgerows
the
quarterly
term
came
round
and
no
notice
that
he
might
look
out
for
another
tenant
reached
mr
rowland
if
they
would
not
go
of
their
own
accord
they
must
be
dislodged
for
she
felt
though
she
did
not
fully
admit
the
truth
to
herself
that
she
could
not
much
longer
endure
their
presence
she
looked
out
for
an
opportunity
of
opening
the
subject
advantageously
with
mr
rowland
the
wine
and
walnuts
were
on
the
table
and
the
gentleman
and
lady
were
amusing
themselves
with
letting
anna
and
ned
try
to
crack
walnuts
the
three
elder
children
being
by
this
time
at
school
at
blickley
when
mrs
rowland
began
her
attack
my
dear
said
she
is
the
in
perfectly
good
repair
at
present
i
believe
so
it
was
thoroughly
set
to
rights
when
mr
hope
went
into
it
and
again
after
the
riot
and
i
have
heard
no
complaint
since
ah
after
the
riot
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know
the
surgery
is
well
fitted
up
is
it
no
doubt
the
magistrates
took
care
that
everything
should
be
done
handsomely
mr
hope
was
fully
satisfied
he
was
then
there
seems
no
doubt
that
mr
walcot
had
better
remove
to
the
when
the
hopes
go
away
it
is
made
to
be
a
residence
and
i
own
i
do
not
like
to
see
those
blinds
of
mr
walcot
with
that
staring
word
upon
them
in
the
windows
of
my
poor
mother
nor
i
but
the
hopes
are
not
going
to
remove
i
believe
they
will
be
leaving
deerbrook
before
long
i
believe
not
my
dear
mr
rowland
i
have
reason
for
what
i
say
so
have
i
take
care
of
that
little
thumb
of
yours
my
darling
or
you
will
be
cracking
it
instead
of
the
walnut
what
is
your
reason
for
thinking
that
the
hopes
will
not
leave
deerbrook
mr
rowland
mr
hope
told
me
so
himself
ah
that
is
nothing
you
will
be
about
the
last
person
he
will
inform
of
his
plans
mr
walcot
nearest
friends
will
be
the
last
to
know
of
course
pray
do
not
make
me
out
one
of
mr
walcot
nearest
friends
my
dear
i
have
a
very
slight
acquaintance
with
the
young
gentleman
and
do
not
intend
to
have
more
you
say
so
now
to
annoy
me
my
love
but
you
may
change
your
mind
if
you
should
see
mr
walcot
your
at
some
future
day
you
will
not
go
on
to
call
him
a
slight
acquaintance
i
suppose
my
have
you
been
asking
him
to
marry
matilda
i
wait
mr
rowland
till
he
asks
it
himself
which
i
foresee
he
will
do
as
soon
as
our
dear
girl
is
old
enough
to
warrant
his
introducing
the
subject
her
accomplishments
are
not
lost
upon
him
he
has
the
prophetic
eye
which
sees
what
a
wonderful
creature
she
must
become
and
if
we
are
permitted
to
witness
such
an
attachment
as
theirs
will
be
and
our
dear
girl
settled
beside
us
here
we
shall
have
nothing
left
to
wish
to
speak
of
something
more
nearly
at
hand
i
beg
my
dear
that
you
will
hold
out
no
expectation
of
the
to
mr
walcot
as
it
is
not
likely
to
be
vacated
has
the
rent
been
regularly
paid
so
far
to
be
sure
it
has
by
mr
grey
help
i
have
no
doubt
my
dear
i
know
what
i
am
saying
the
hopes
are
as
poor
as
the
rats
in
your
granary
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
mr
grey
will
long
go
on
paying
their
rent
for
them
just
for
the
frolic
of
sustaining
mr
hope
against
mr
walcot
it
is
paying
too
dear
for
the
fancy
the
hopes
are
wretchedly
pinched
for
money
they
have
dropped
their
subscription
to
the
book
club
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
i
would
give
half
i
am
worth
that
it
were
otherwise
give
it
them
at
once
then
and
it
will
be
otherwise
i
would
gladly
but
they
will
not
take
it
i
advise
you
to
try
however
it
would
make
such
a
pretty
romantic
story
well
mr
grey
is
extremely
mortified
at
their
withdrawing
from
the
book
club
he
remonstrated
very
strongly
indeed
that
does
not
agree
very
well
with
his
paying
their
rent
for
them
perfectly
well
he
thinks
that
if
he
undertakes
the
large
thing
for
the
sake
of
their
credit
they
might
have
managed
the
small
this
is
his
way
of
viewing
the
matter
no
doubt
he
sees
how
their
credit
will
suffer
by
their
giving
up
the
book
club
he
sees
how
everybody
will
remark
upon
it
so
do
they
i
have
no
doubt
and
the
matter
will
not
be
mended
by
sophia
grey
nonsense
what
absurd
things
that
girl
does
i
wonder
her
mother
allows
it
only
that
to
be
sure
she
is
not
much
wiser
herself
sophia
has
told
some
of
her
acquaintance
and
all
deerbrook
will
hear
it
before
long
that
her
cousins
have
withdrawn
from
the
book
club
on
account
of
situation
that
they
are
to
be
so
busy
with
the
baby
that
is
coming
that
they
will
have
no
time
to
read
as
long
as
the
hopes
are
above
false
pretences
they
need
not
care
for
such
as
are
made
for
them
there
show
mamma
what
a
nice
plump
walnut
you
have
cracked
for
her
nicely
done
my
pet
but
mr
rowland
the
hopes
can
not
hold
out
they
can
not
possibly
stay
here
you
will
not
get
their
rent
at
christmas
depend
upon
it
i
shall
not
press
them
for
it
i
assure
you
then
you
will
be
unjust
to
your
family
you
owe
it
to
your
children
to
say
nothing
of
myself
to
look
after
your
property
i
owe
it
to
them
not
to
show
myself
a
harsh
landlord
to
excellent
tenants
but
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
what
will
happen
at
christmas
it
may
be
that
the
rent
will
make
its
appearance
on
the
morning
of
then
if
not
you
will
give
them
notice
that
the
house
is
let
from
the
next
quarter
will
you
not
by
no
means
my
dear
if
you
do
not
like
to
undertake
the
office
yourself
perhaps
you
will
let
me
do
it
i
have
a
good
deal
of
courage
about
doing
disagreeable
things
on
occasion
you
have
my
dear
but
i
do
not
wish
that
this
should
be
done
i
mean
i
desire
that
it
be
not
done
the
hopes
shall
live
in
that
house
of
mine
as
long
as
they
please
and
if
continued
mr
rowland
not
liking
the
expression
of
his
lady
eye
if
any
one
disturbs
them
in
their
present
abode
the
consequence
will
be
that
i
shall
be
compelled
to
invite
them
here
i
shall
establish
them
in
this
very
house
sooner
than
that
they
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
deerbrook
against
their
will
and
then
my
dear
you
will
have
to
be
off
to
cheltenham
again
what
nonsense
you
talk
mr
rowland
who
should
disturb
them
if
you
wo
be
open
to
reason
so
as
to
do
it
yourself
i
thought
you
knew
enough
of
what
it
is
to
be
ridden
by
poor
tenants
to
wish
to
avoid
the
plague
if
warned
in
time
but
some
people
can
never
take
warning
let
us
see
that
you
can
my
love
you
will
remember
what
i
have
said
about
the
hopes
being
disturbed
i
have
no
doubt
and
now
we
have
done
with
that
i
want
to
tell
you
presently
when
we
have
really
done
with
this
subject
my
dear
i
have
other
reasons
which
you
will
spare
me
the
hearing
my
dear
priscilla
there
are
no
reasons
on
earth
which
can
justify
me
in
turning
this
family
out
of
their
house
or
you
in
asking
me
to
do
it
let
us
hear
no
more
about
it
but
you
must
hear
i
will
be
heard
on
a
subject
in
which
i
have
such
an
interest
mr
rowland
ring
the
bell
my
little
fellow
pull
hard
that
it
candles
in
the
office
immediately
and
mr
rowland
tossed
off
the
last
half
of
his
glass
of
port
kissed
the
little
ones
and
was
gone
the
lady
remained
to
compassionate
herself
which
she
did
very
deeply
that
she
could
find
no
means
of
ridding
herself
of
the
great
plague
of
her
life
these
people
were
always
in
her
way
and
no
one
would
help
her
to
dislodge
them
her
own
husband
was
against
her
quite
unmanageable
and
perverse
chapter
thirty
eight
the
victims
if
mrs
rowland
was
dissatisfied
with
her
success
while
seeing
that
some
resources
of
comfort
remained
to
the
hopes
and
margaret
a
view
of
the
interior
of
the
would
probably
have
affected
her
deeply
and
set
her
moralising
on
the
incompleteness
of
all
human
triumphs
there
was
peace
there
which
even
she
could
not
invade
could
only
if
she
had
known
it
envy
her
power
was
now
exhausted
and
her
work
was
unfinished
for
many
weeks
she
had
made
margaret
as
miserable
as
she
had
intended
to
make
her
margaret
had
suffered
from
an
exasperating
sense
of
injury
but
that
was
only
for
a
few
hours
hers
was
not
a
nature
which
could
retain
personal
resentment
for
any
length
of
time
she
needed
the
relief
of
compassionate
and
forgiving
feelings
and
she
cast
herself
into
them
for
solace
as
the
traveller
emerging
from
the
glaring
desert
throws
himself
down
beside
the
gushing
spring
in
the
shade
from
the
moment
that
she
did
this
it
became
her
chief
trouble
that
philip
was
blamed
by
others
her
friends
said
as
little
as
they
could
in
reference
to
him
out
of
regard
for
her
feelings
but
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
maria
indignation
was
strong
and
that
hester
considered
that
her
sister
had
had
a
happy
escape
from
a
man
capable
of
treating
her
as
philip
had
done
if
it
had
been
possible
to
undertake
his
defence
margaret
would
have
done
so
as
there
were
no
means
of
working
upon
others
to
forgive
her
wrongs
she
made
it
her
consolation
to
forgive
them
doubly
herself
to
cheer
up
under
them
to
live
for
the
aim
of
being
more
worthy
of
philip
love
the
less
he
believed
her
to
be
so
her
lot
was
far
easier
now
than
it
had
been
in
the
winter
she
had
been
his
and
she
believed
that
she
still
occupied
his
whole
soul
she
was
not
now
the
solitary
being
she
had
felt
herself
before
though
cut
off
from
intercourse
with
him
as
if
the
grave
lay
between
them
she
knew
that
sympathy
with
her
heart
and
mind
existed
she
experienced
the
struggles
the
moaning
efforts
of
affections
doomed
to
solitude
and
silence
the
shrinking
from
a
whole
long
life
of
of
exclusion
from
domestic
life
the
occasional
horror
of
contemplating
the
waste
and
withering
of
some
of
the
noblest
parts
of
the
immortal
nature
a
waste
and
withering
which
are
the
almost
certain
consequence
of
violence
done
to
its
instincts
and
its
laws
from
these
pains
and
terrors
she
suffered
and
from
some
of
smaller
account
from
the
petty
insults
or
speculations
of
the
more
of
her
neighbours
and
the
being
too
suddenly
reminded
by
passing
circumstances
of
the
change
which
had
come
over
her
expectations
and
prospects
but
her
love
her
forgiveness
her
conviction
of
being
beloved
bore
her
through
all
these
and
saved
her
from
that
fever
of
the
heart
in
the
paroxysms
of
which
she
had
in
her
former
and
severer
trial
longed
for
death
even
for
she
could
enjoy
but
little
of
what
had
been
her
favourite
solace
at
that
time
she
had
but
few
opportunities
now
for
long
solitary
walks
she
saw
the
autumn
fading
away
melting
in
rain
and
cold
fog
without
its
having
been
made
use
of
it
had
been
as
unfavourable
a
season
as
the
summer
dreary
unproductive
disappointing
in
every
way
but
there
had
been
days
in
the
latter
autumn
when
the
sun
had
shown
his
dim
face
when
the
dank
hedges
had
looked
fresh
and
the
fallen
leaves
in
the
had
rustled
under
the
tread
of
the
squirrel
and
margaret
would
on
such
days
have
liked
to
spend
the
whole
morning
in
rambles
by
herself
but
there
were
reasons
why
she
should
not
almost
before
the
chilliness
of
the
coming
season
began
to
be
felt
hardship
was
complained
of
throughout
the
country
the
prices
of
provisions
were
inordinately
high
and
the
evil
consequences
which
in
the
rural
districts
follow
upon
a
scarcity
began
to
make
themselves
felt
the
poachers
were
daring
beyond
belief
and
deep
was
the
enmity
between
the
large
proprietors
and
the
labourers
around
them
the
oldest
men
and
women
and
children
scarcely
able
to
walk
were
found
trespassing
day
by
day
in
all
plantations
with
bags
aprons
or
pinafores
full
of
and
wood
snapped
off
from
the
trees
or
plucked
out
of
the
hedges
there
was
no
end
to
repairing
the
fences
there
were
unpleasant
rumours
too
of
its
being
no
longer
safe
to
walk
singly
in
the
more
retired
places
no
such
thing
as
highway
robbery
had
ever
before
been
heard
of
at
deerbrook
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
the
oldest
of
the
inhabitants
being
jim
bird
the
man
of
a
hundred
years
but
there
was
reason
now
for
the
caution
mr
had
been
stopped
on
the
by
two
men
who
came
out
of
the
hedge
and
helped
themselves
to
what
the
cart
contained
an
fellow
had
crossed
the
path
of
mrs
james
and
her
young
sister
in
the
verdon
woods
evidently
with
the
intention
of
stopping
the
ladies
but
luckily
the
jingling
of
a
was
heard
below
and
the
man
had
retreated
mr
grey
had
desired
that
the
ladies
of
his
family
would
not
go
further
without
his
escort
than
a
mile
out
and
back
again
on
the
they
were
not
to
attempt
the
lanes
the
miss
andersons
no
longer
came
into
deerbrook
in
their
and
mrs
howell
reported
to
all
her
customers
that
lady
hunter
never
walked
in
her
own
grounds
without
a
footman
behind
her
two
dogs
before
her
and
the
within
hearing
of
a
scream
mr
walcot
was
advised
to
leave
his
watch
and
purse
at
home
when
he
set
forth
to
visit
his
country
patients
and
it
did
not
comfort
him
much
to
perceive
that
his
neighbours
were
always
vigilant
to
note
the
hour
and
minute
of
his
setting
forth
and
to
learn
the
precise
time
when
he
might
be
looked
for
at
home
again
it
was
observed
that
he
was
generally
back
sooner
than
he
was
expected
with
a
very
red
face
and
his
horse
all
in
a
foam
in
addition
to
these
grounds
of
objection
to
solitary
walks
margaret
had
strong
domestic
reasons
for
denying
herself
the
rambles
she
delighted
in
as
the
months
rolled
on
poverty
pressed
closer
and
closer
when
the
rent
was
secured
and
some
of
the
comforts
provided
which
hester
must
have
in
her
confinement
so
little
was
left
that
it
became
necessary
to
limit
the
weekly
expenses
of
the
family
to
a
sum
small
enough
to
require
the
nicest
management
and
the
most
strenuous
domestic
industry
to
make
it
suffice
hope
would
not
pledge
his
credit
while
he
saw
so
little
prospect
of
redeeming
it
his
family
were
of
one
mind
as
to
purchasing
nothing
which
they
were
not
certainly
able
to
pay
for
this
being
his
principle
he
made
every
effort
to
increase
his
funds
a
guinea
or
two
dropped
in
now
and
then
in
return
for
contributions
to
medical
periodicals
money
was
due
to
him
from
some
of
his
patients
to
these
he
sent
in
his
bills
again
and
even
made
personal
application
from
several
he
obtained
promises
from
two
or
three
the
amount
of
whose
debt
was
very
small
he
got
his
money
disgraced
by
smiles
of
wonder
and
contempt
from
the
greater
number
he
received
nothing
but
excuses
on
account
of
the
pressure
of
the
times
the
small
sums
he
did
recover
were
of
a
value
which
none
of
the
three
had
ever
imagined
that
money
could
be
to
them
every
little
extra
comfort
thus
obtained
the
dinner
of
meat
once
oftener
in
the
week
the
fire
in
the
evening
the
new
gloves
for
hope
when
the
old
ones
could
no
longer
by
any
mending
be
made
to
look
fit
for
him
what
a
luxury
it
was
and
all
the
more
for
being
secretly
enjoyed
no
one
out
of
the
house
had
a
suspicion
how
far
their
poverty
had
gone
mr
grey
had
really
been
vexed
at
them
for
withdrawing
from
the
book
club
had
attributed
this
instance
of
economy
to
the
enthusiasm
which
was
in
his
eyes
the
fault
of
the
family
and
never
dreamed
of
their
not
dining
on
meat
vegetables
and
pudding
with
their
glass
of
wine
every
day
the
greys
little
knew
what
a
blessing
they
were
conferring
on
their
cousins
when
they
insisted
on
having
them
for
a
long
day
once
more
before
hester
confinement
and
set
them
down
to
steaming
soup
and
a
plentiful
joint
and
accompaniments
without
stint
the
guests
laughed
when
they
were
at
home
again
over
the
new
sort
of
pleasure
they
had
felt
the
delight
at
the
sight
of
a
good
dinner
to
which
nothing
was
wanting
but
that
morris
should
have
had
her
share
morris
for
her
part
had
been
very
happy
at
home
she
had
put
aside
for
her
luncheon
next
day
the
broth
which
she
had
been
told
was
for
her
and
had
feasted
on
potatoes
and
water
and
the
idea
of
the
good
dinner
her
young
ladies
were
to
enjoy
while
their
affairs
were
in
this
state
it
was
a
great
luxury
in
the
family
to
have
any
unusual
comfort
which
betokened
that
hope
had
been
successful
in
some
of
his
errands
had
received
a
fee
or
recovered
the
amount
of
a
bill
one
day
morris
brought
in
a
goose
and
giblets
which
had
been
bought
and
paid
for
by
mr
hope
the
messenger
said
another
morning
came
a
sack
of
apples
from
the
orchard
of
a
country
patient
who
was
willing
to
pay
in
kind
at
another
time
edward
emptied
his
pockets
of
knitted
worsted
stockings
and
mittens
the
handiwork
of
a
farmer
dame
who
was
flattered
by
his
taking
the
produce
of
her
evening
industry
instead
of
money
which
she
could
not
well
spare
at
the
present
season
there
was
more
mirth
more
real
gladness
in
the
house
on
the
arrival
of
windfalls
like
these
than
if
hope
had
daily
exhibited
a
purse
full
of
gold
there
was
no
sting
in
their
poverty
no
adventitious
misery
belonging
to
it
they
suffered
its
genuine
force
and
that
was
all
what
is
poverty
not
destitution
but
poverty
it
has
many
shapes
aspects
almost
as
various
as
the
minds
and
circumstances
of
those
whom
it
visits
it
is
famine
to
the
savage
in
the
wilds
it
is
hardship
to
the
labourer
in
the
cottage
it
is
disgrace
to
the
proud
and
to
the
miser
despair
it
is
a
spectre
which
with
dread
of
change
perplexes
him
who
lives
at
ease
such
are
its
aspects
but
what
is
it
it
is
a
deficiency
of
the
comforts
of
life
a
deficiency
present
and
to
come
it
involves
many
other
things
but
this
is
what
it
is
is
it
then
worth
all
the
apprehension
and
grief
it
occasions
is
it
an
adequate
cause
for
the
gloom
of
the
merchant
the
discontent
of
the
artisan
the
foreboding
sighs
of
the
mother
the
ghastly
dreams
which
haunt
the
avaricious
the
conscious
debasement
of
the
subservient
the
humiliation
of
the
proud
these
are
severe
sufferings
are
they
authorised
by
the
nature
of
poverty
certainly
not
if
poverty
induced
no
adventitious
evils
involved
nothing
but
a
deficiency
of
the
comforts
of
life
leaving
life
itself
unimpaired
the
life
is
more
than
food
and
the
body
than
raiment
and
the
untimely
extinction
of
the
life
itself
would
not
be
worth
the
pangs
which
apprehended
poverty
excites
but
poverty
involves
woes
which
in
their
sum
are
far
greater
than
itself
to
a
multitude
it
is
the
loss
of
a
pursuit
which
they
have
yet
to
learn
will
be
certainly
supplied
for
such
alleviation
or
compensation
is
in
store
in
the
rising
up
of
objects
new
and
the
creation
of
fresh
hopes
the
impoverished
merchant
who
may
no
longer
look
out
for
his
argosies
may
yet
be
in
glee
when
he
finds
it
a
rare
dropping
morning
for
the
early
colewort
to
another
multitude
poverty
involves
loss
of
rank
a
letting
down
among
strangers
whose
manners
are
ungenial
and
their
thoughts
unfamiliar
for
these
there
may
be
solace
in
retirement
or
the
evil
may
fall
short
of
its
threats
the
reduced
gentlewoman
may
live
in
patient
solitude
or
may
grow
into
sympathy
with
her
neighbours
by
raising
some
of
them
up
to
herself
and
by
warming
her
heart
at
the
great
central
fire
of
humanity
which
burns
on
under
the
crust
of
manners
as
rough
as
the
storms
of
the
tropics
or
as
frigid
as
polar
snows
the
avaricious
are
out
of
the
pale
of
peace
already
and
at
all
events
poverty
is
most
seriously
an
evil
to
sons
and
daughters
who
see
their
parents
stripped
of
comfort
at
an
age
when
comfort
is
almost
one
with
life
itself
and
to
parents
who
watch
the
narrowing
of
the
capacities
of
their
children
by
the
pressure
of
poverty
the
impairing
of
their
promise
the
blotting
out
of
their
prospects
to
such
mourning
children
there
is
little
comfort
but
in
contemplating
the
easier
life
which
lies
behind
and
it
may
be
hoped
the
happier
one
which
stretches
before
their
parents
on
the
other
side
the
postern
of
life
if
there
is
sunshine
on
the
two
grand
reaches
of
their
path
the
shadow
which
lies
in
the
midst
is
necessarily
but
a
temporary
gloom
to
grieving
parents
it
should
be
a
consoling
truth
that
as
the
life
is
more
than
food
so
is
the
soul
more
than
instruction
and
opportunity
and
such
accomplishments
as
man
can
administer
that
as
the
fowls
are
fed
and
the
lilies
clothed
by
him
whose
hand
made
the
air
musical
with
the
one
and
dressed
the
fields
with
the
other
so
is
the
human
spirit
nourished
and
adorned
by
airs
from
heaven
which
blow
over
the
whole
earth
and
light
from
the
skies
which
no
hand
is
permitted
to
intercept
parents
know
not
but
that
providence
may
be
substituting
the
noblest
education
for
the
misteaching
of
intermediate
guardians
it
may
possibly
be
so
but
if
not
still
there
is
appointed
to
every
human
being
much
training
many
privileges
which
capricious
fortune
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
the
father
may
sigh
to
see
his
boy
condemned
to
the
toil
of
the
loom
or
the
gossip
and
drudgery
of
the
shop
when
he
would
fain
have
beheld
him
the
ornament
of
a
university
but
he
knows
not
whether
a
more
simple
integrity
a
loftier
disinterestedness
may
not
come
out
of
the
humbler
discipline
than
the
higher
privilege
the
mother
eyes
may
swim
as
she
hears
her
little
daughter
sing
her
baby
brother
to
sleep
on
the
cottage
threshold
her
eyes
may
swim
at
the
thought
how
those
wild
and
moving
tones
might
have
been
exalted
by
art
such
art
would
have
been
in
itself
a
good
but
would
this
child
then
have
been
as
now
about
her
father
business
which
in
ministering
to
one
of
his
little
ones
she
is
as
surely
as
the
archangel
who
suspends
new
systems
of
worlds
in
the
furthest
void
her
occupation
is
now
earnest
and
holy
and
what
need
the
true
mother
wish
for
more
what
is
poverty
to
those
who
are
not
thus
set
in
families
what
is
it
to
the
solitary
or
to
the
husband
and
wife
who
have
faith
in
each
other
strength
if
they
have
the
higher
faith
which
usually
originates
mutual
trust
mere
poverty
is
scarcely
worth
a
passing
fear
if
they
have
plucked
out
the
stings
of
pride
and
selfishness
and
purified
their
vision
by
faith
what
is
there
to
dread
what
is
their
case
they
have
life
without
certainty
how
it
is
to
be
nourished
they
do
without
certainty
like
the
young
ravens
which
cry
and
work
for
and
enjoy
the
subsistence
of
the
day
leaving
the
morrow
to
take
care
of
what
concerns
it
if
living
in
the
dreariest
abodes
of
a
town
the
light
from
within
shines
in
the
dark
place
and
dispelling
the
mists
of
worldly
care
guides
to
the
blessing
of
tending
the
sick
and
sharing
the
food
of
with
the
orphan
and
him
who
has
no
help
but
in
them
if
the
philosopher
goes
into
such
retreats
with
his
lantern
there
may
he
best
find
the
generous
and
the
brave
if
instead
of
the
alleys
of
a
city
they
live
under
the
open
sky
they
are
yet
lighter
under
their
poverty
there
however
blank
the
future
may
lie
before
them
they
have
the
living
reality
of
lawns
and
woods
and
flocks
in
the
green
pasture
and
beside
the
still
waters
which
silently
remind
them
of
the
shepherd
under
whom
they
shall
not
want
any
real
good
thing
the
quiet
of
the
shady
lane
is
theirs
and
the
beauty
of
the
blossoming
thorn
above
the
pool
delight
steals
through
them
with
the
scent
of
the
violet
or
the
new
mown
hay
if
they
have
hushed
the
voices
of
complaint
and
fear
within
them
there
is
the
music
of
the
merry
lark
for
them
or
of
the
leaping
waterfall
or
of
a
whole
orchestra
of
harps
when
the
breeze
sweeps
through
a
grove
of
pines
while
it
is
not
for
fortune
to
rob
them
of
free
nature
grace
and
while
she
leaves
them
life
and
strength
of
limb
and
soul
the
certainty
of
a
future
though
they
can
not
see
what
and
the
assurance
of
progression
though
they
can
not
see
how
is
poverty
worth
for
themselves
more
than
a
passing
doubt
can
it
ever
be
worth
the
torment
of
fear
the
bondage
of
subservience
the
compromise
of
free
thought
the
sacrifice
of
free
speech
the
bending
of
the
erect
head
the
veiling
of
the
open
brow
the
repression
of
the
salient
soul
if
instead
of
this
poverty
should
act
as
the
liberator
of
the
spirit
awakening
it
to
trust
in
god
and
sympathy
for
man
and
placing
it
aloft
fresh
and
free
like
morning
on
the
to
survey
the
expanse
of
life
and
recognise
its
realities
from
beneath
its
mists
it
should
be
greeted
with
that
holy
joy
before
which
all
sorrow
and
sighing
flee
away
their
poverty
which
had
never
afflicted
them
very
grievously
was
almost
lost
sight
of
by
the
family
when
hester
infant
was
born
they
were
all
happy
and
satisfied
then
though
there
were
people
in
deerbrook
who
found
fault
with
their
arrangements
and
were
extremely
scandalised
when
it
was
found
that
no
nurse
had
arrived
from
blickley
and
that
morris
took
the
charge
of
her
mistress
upon
herself
the
greys
pronounced
by
their
own
fireside
that
it
was
a
strange
fancy
carrying
an
affection
for
an
old
servant
to
a
rather
romantic
extreme
that
it
was
a
fresh
instance
of
the
enthusiasm
which
adversity
had
not
yet
moderated
in
their
cousins
as
might
have
been
wished
however
sophia
vaunted
the
attachment
of
morris
to
her
young
mistress
an
attachment
so
strong
as
that
she
would
have
been
really
hurt
if
any
one
else
had
been
allowed
to
sit
up
with
hester
and
indeed
no
one
could
have
filled
her
place
half
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
family
morris
had
had
so
much
experience
and
was
as
fond
of
her
charge
as
a
mother
could
be
no
one
knew
what
a
treasure
her
cousins
had
in
morris
all
of
which
was
true
in
its
separate
particulars
though
altogether
it
did
not
constitute
the
reason
why
hester
had
no
nurse
from
buckley
they
were
happy
and
satisfied
yes
even
margaret
this
infant
opened
up
a
spring
of
consolation
in
her
heart
which
she
could
not
have
believed
existed
there
on
this
child
she
could
pour
out
some
of
her
repressed
affections
and
on
him
did
she
rest
her
baffled
hopes
he
beguiled
her
into
the
future
from
which
she
had
hitherto
recoiled
that
helpless
unconscious
little
creature
cradled
on
her
arm
and
knowing
nothing
of
its
was
more
powerful
than
sister
brother
or
friend
than
philosophy
or
religion
in
luring
her
imagination
onward
into
future
years
of
honour
and
peace
holy
and
sweet
was
the
calm
of
her
mind
as
forgetting
herself
and
her
griefs
she
watched
the
first
efforts
of
this
infant
to
acquaint
himself
with
his
own
powers
and
with
the
world
about
him
when
she
smiled
at
the
ungainly
stretching
of
the
little
limbs
and
the
unpractised
movement
of
his
eyes
seeking
the
light
holy
and
sweet
were
the
tears
which
swelled
into
her
eyes
when
she
saw
him
at
his
mother
breast
and
could
not
but
gaze
at
the
fresh
and
divine
beauty
now
mantling
on
that
mother
face
amidst
the
joy
of
this
new
relation
it
was
a
delicious
moment
when
hope
came
in
the
first
day
that
hester
sat
by
the
fireside
when
he
stopped
short
for
a
brief
instant
as
if
arrested
by
the
beauty
of
what
he
saw
and
then
glanced
towards
margaret
for
sympathy
it
was
a
delicious
moment
to
her
the
moment
of
that
full
free
unembarrassed
glance
which
she
had
scarcely
met
since
the
first
days
of
their
acquaintance
it
was
a
pleasure
to
them
all
to
see
hester
well
provided
with
luxuries
maria
knowing
that
her
surgeon
would
not
accept
money
from
her
took
this
opportunity
of
sending
in
wine
oh
the
pleasure
of
finding
the
neglected
corkscrew
and
making
morris
take
a
glass
with
them
the
greys
brought
game
and
hester
little
table
was
well
served
every
day
with
what
zeal
did
margaret
apply
herself
under
morris
teaching
to
cook
hester
choice
little
dinners
yes
to
cook
them
margaret
was
learning
all
morris
arts
from
her
for
of
two
troubles
which
somewhat
disturbed
this
season
of
comfort
one
was
that
it
appeared
too
certain
that
morris
must
go
as
susan
and
charles
had
gone
before
her
no
one
had
expressly
declared
this
it
was
left
undiscussed
apparently
by
common
consent
till
it
should
be
ascertained
that
baby
was
healthy
and
hester
getting
strong
but
the
thought
was
in
the
minds
of
them
all
and
their
plans
involved
preparation
for
this
the
other
trouble
was
that
with
peace
and
comfort
some
slight
very
slight
symptoms
recurred
of
hester
propensity
to
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
wonder
was
that
for
weeks
and
months
she
had
been
relieved
from
her
old
enemy
to
the
extent
she
had
been
the
reverence
with
which
her
husband
and
sister
regarded
the
temper
in
which
she
had
borne
unbounded
provocation
and
most
unmerited
adversity
sometimes
beguiled
them
into
a
hope
that
her
troubles
from
within
were
over
for
ever
but
a
little
reflection
and
some
slight
experience
taught
them
that
this
was
unreasonable
they
remembered
that
the
infirmity
of
a
lifetime
was
not
to
be
wholly
cured
in
and
that
they
must
expect
some
recurrence
of
her
old
malady
at
times
when
there
was
no
immediate
appeal
to
her
magnanimity
and
no
present
cause
for
anxiety
for
those
in
whom
she
forgot
herself
the
first
time
that
hester
was
in
the
for
the
whole
day
morris
was
laying
the
cloth
for
dinner
and
margaret
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
the
baby
on
her
arm
when
hope
came
in
hester
forgot
everybody
and
everything
else
when
her
husband
appeared
a
fact
which
morris
benevolence
was
never
weary
of
noting
and
commenting
upon
to
herself
she
often
wondered
if
ever
lady
loved
her
husband
as
her
young
mistress
did
and
she
smiled
to
herself
to
see
the
welcome
that
beamed
upon
hester
whole
face
when
hope
came
to
take
his
seat
beside
her
on
the
sofa
this
was
in
her
mind
when
her
master
presently
said
where
is
my
boy
i
have
not
seen
him
for
hours
why
do
you
put
him
out
of
his
father
way
oh
margaret
has
him
come
margaret
yield
him
up
you
can
have
him
all
the
hours
that
i
am
away
you
do
not
grudge
him
to
me
do
you
my
master
wo
have
to
complain
as
many
gentlemen
do
said
morris
or
as
many
gentlemen
feel
if
they
do
complain
that
he
is
neglected
for
the
sake
of
his
baby
if
you
enjoy
your
dinner
love
said
hester
you
must
not
give
me
the
credit
of
it
you
and
i
are
to
sit
down
to
our
pheasant
together
they
tell
me
margaret
and
morris
will
have
it
that
they
have
both
dined
there
is
little
in
getting
a
comfortable
dinner
ready
said
morris
whether
it
is
the
lady
herself
or
another
that
looks
to
a
trifle
like
that
it
is
the
seeing
his
wife
so
full
of
care
and
thought
about
her
baby
as
to
have
none
to
spare
for
him
that
frets
many
an
one
who
does
not
like
to
say
anything
about
it
fathers
can
not
be
so
taken
with
a
very
young
baby
as
the
mothers
are
and
it
is
mortifying
to
feel
themselves
neglected
for
a
newcomer
i
have
often
seen
that
my
dears
but
i
shall
never
see
it
here
i
find
i
do
not
know
how
you
should
morris
said
hester
in
something
of
the
old
tone
which
made
her
sister
heart
throb
almost
before
it
reached
her
ear
margaret
will
save
me
from
any
such
danger
margaret
takes
care
that
nobody
shall
be
engrossed
with
the
baby
but
herself
she
has
not
a
thought
to
spare
for
any
of
us
while
she
has
baby
in
her
arms
the
little
fellow
has
cut
us
all
out
margaret
quickly
transferred
the
infant
to
her
brother
arm
and
left
the
room
she
thought
it
best
for
her
heart
was
very
full
and
she
could
not
speak
she
restrained
her
tears
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
busy
herself
about
the
dinner
she
had
cooked
is
a
fine
pheasant
indeed
miss
margaret
my
dear
and
beautifully
roasted
i
am
sure
and
i
hope
you
will
go
up
and
see
them
enjoy
it
i
am
so
sorry
my
dear
for
what
i
said
just
now
i
merely
spoke
what
came
up
in
my
mind
when
i
felt
pleased
and
never
thought
of
its
bringing
on
any
remark
nor
was
anything
intended
i
am
sure
that
should
make
you
look
so
sad
so
do
you
go
up
and
take
the
baby
again
when
they
sit
down
to
dinner
as
if
nothing
had
been
said
do
my
dear
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
i
will
follow
you
with
the
dinner
in
a
minute
i
wonder
how
it
is
my
love
said
hope
in
a
voice
which
spoke
all
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
you
can
endure
wrong
so
nobly
and
that
you
can
not
bear
the
natural
course
of
events
tell
me
how
it
is
hester
that
you
have
sustained
magnanimously
all
the
injuries
and
misfortunes
of
many
months
and
that
you
now
quarrel
with
margaret
affection
for
our
child
ah
why
indeed
edward
she
replied
humbly
why
but
that
i
am
unworthy
that
such
an
one
as
margaret
should
love
me
and
my
child
enough
enough
i
only
want
to
show
you
how
i
regard
the
case
about
this
new
love
of
margaret
do
you
not
see
how
much
happier
she
has
been
since
this
little
fellow
was
born
oh
yes
one
may
now
fancy
that
she
may
be
gay
again
let
us
remember
what
an
oppressed
heart
she
had
and
what
it
must
be
to
her
to
have
a
new
object
so
innocent
and
unconscious
as
this
child
to
lavish
her
affection
upon
do
not
let
us
grudge
her
the
consolation
or
poison
the
pleasure
of
this
fresh
interest
i
am
afraid
it
is
done
cried
hester
in
great
distress
i
was
wicked
i
was
more
cruel
than
any
of
our
enemies
when
i
said
what
i
did
i
may
well
bear
with
them
for
god
knows
i
am
at
times
no
better
than
they
i
have
robbed
my
margaret
of
her
only
comfort
spoiled
her
only
pleasure
no
no
here
she
comes
look
at
her
margaret
face
was
indeed
serene
and
she
made
as
light
of
the
matter
as
she
could
when
hester
implored
that
she
would
pardon
her
hasty
and
cruel
words
and
that
she
would
show
her
forgiveness
by
continuing
to
cherish
the
child
he
must
not
begin
to
suffer
already
for
his
faults
hester
said
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
margaret
forgiveness
nor
of
her
forgetfulness
of
what
had
been
said
as
far
as
forgetfulness
was
possible
but
the
worst
of
such
sayings
is
that
they
carry
in
them
that
which
prevents
their
being
ever
quite
forgotten
hester
had
effectually
established
a
constraint
in
her
sister
intercourse
with
the
baby
and
imposed
upon
margaret
the
incessant
care
of
scrupulously
adjusting
the
claims
of
the
mother
and
the
child
the
evils
arising
from
faulty
temper
may
be
borne
may
be
concealed
but
can
never
be
fully
repaired
happy
they
whose
part
it
is
to
endure
and
to
conceal
rather
than
to
inflict
and
to
strive
uselessly
to
repair
margaret
part
was
the
easiest
of
the
three
as
they
sat
at
the
table
she
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
all
agreeing
that
the
time
was
come
for
an
explanation
with
morris
for
depending
on
themselves
for
almost
all
the
work
of
the
house
come
morris
said
hester
when
the
cloth
was
removed
you
must
spare
us
we
want
to
consult
with
you
come
and
sit
down
morris
came
with
a
foreboding
heart
it
will
be
no
news
to
you
said
hope
that
we
are
very
poor
you
know
nearly
as
much
of
our
affairs
as
we
do
ourselves
as
it
is
right
that
you
should
we
have
not
wished
to
make
any
further
change
in
our
domestic
plans
till
this
little
fellow
was
born
but
now
that
he
is
beginning
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
and
that
his
mother
is
well
and
strong
we
feel
that
we
must
consider
of
some
further
effort
to
spend
still
less
than
we
do
now
there
are
two
ways
in
which
this
may
be
done
we
think
morris
said
hester
we
may
either
keep
the
comfort
of
having
you
with
us
and
pinch
ourselves
more
as
to
dress
and
the
table
oh
i
hope
you
will
not
carry
that
any
further
well
if
we
do
not
carry
that
any
further
the
only
thing
to
be
done
i
fear
is
to
part
with
you
is
there
no
other
way
i
wonder
said
morris
as
if
thinking
aloud
if
it
must
be
one
of
these
ways
it
certainly
seems
to
me
to
be
better
for
ladies
to
work
hard
with
good
food
than
to
have
a
servant
and
stint
themselves
in
health
and
strength
but
who
would
have
thought
of
my
young
ladies
coming
to
this
it
is
a
situation
in
which
hundreds
and
thousands
are
placed
morris
and
why
not
we
as
well
as
they
may
be
so
but
it
grieves
one
too
do
not
grieve
i
believe
we
all
think
that
this
parting
with
you
is
the
first
real
grief
that
our
change
of
fortune
has
caused
us
somehow
or
other
we
have
been
exceedingly
comfortable
in
our
poverty
if
that
had
been
all
we
should
have
had
a
very
happy
year
of
it
one
would
desire
to
say
nothing
against
what
is
god
will
but
one
may
be
allowed
perhaps
to
hope
that
better
times
will
come
i
do
hope
it
and
believe
it
said
her
master
and
if
better
times
come
morris
you
will
return
to
us
will
you
not
my
dear
you
know
nothing
would
make
me
leave
you
now
as
you
say
i
am
a
comfort
to
you
if
i
had
any
right
to
say
i
would
stay
i
could
live
upon
as
little
as
anybody
and
could
do
almost
without
any
wages
but
there
is
my
poor
sister
you
know
ladies
she
depends
upon
me
for
everything
now
that
she
can
not
work
herself
and
i
must
earn
money
for
her
we
are
quite
aware
of
that
said
margaret
it
is
for
your
sake
and
hers
quite
as
much
as
for
our
own
that
we
think
we
must
part
we
wish
to
know
what
you
would
like
to
do
said
hester
shall
we
try
to
find
a
situation
for
you
near
us
or
would
you
be
happier
to
go
down
among
your
old
friends
i
had
better
go
where
i
am
sure
of
employment
better
go
down
to
birmingham
at
once
i
should
never
have
left
it
but
for
my
young
ladies
sakes
but
i
should
be
right
glad
my
dears
to
leave
it
again
for
you
if
you
can
at
any
time
write
to
say
you
wish
for
me
back
there
is
another
way
i
have
thought
of
sometimes
but
of
course
you
can
not
have
overlooked
anything
that
could
occur
to
me
if
you
would
all
go
to
birmingham
you
have
so
many
friends
there
and
my
master
would
be
valued
as
he
ought
to
be
which
there
is
no
sign
of
his
being
in
this
place
i
do
not
like
this
place
my
dears
it
is
not
good
enough
for
you
we
think
any
place
good
enough
for
us
where
there
are
men
and
women
living
said
hope
kindly
but
gravely
others
have
thought
as
you
do
morris
and
have
offered
us
temptations
to
go
away
but
we
do
not
think
it
right
if
we
go
we
shall
leave
behind
us
a
bad
character
which
we
do
not
deserve
if
we
stay
i
have
very
little
doubt
of
recovering
my
professional
character
and
winning
over
our
neighbours
to
think
better
of
us
and
be
kind
to
us
again
we
mean
to
try
for
it
if
i
should
have
to
hire
myself
out
as
a
porter
in
mr
grey
yards
pray
do
say
that
sir
but
indeed
i
believe
you
are
so
far
right
as
that
the
good
always
conquers
at
last
just
so
morris
that
is
what
we
trust
and
for
the
sake
of
this
little
fellow
if
for
nothing
else
we
must
stand
by
our
good
name
who
knows
but
that
i
may
leave
him
a
fine
flourishing
practice
in
this
very
place
when
i
retire
or
die
always
supposing
he
means
to
follow
his
father
profession
sir
that
is
looking
forward
very
far
so
it
is
morris
but
however
people
may
disapprove
of
looking
forward
too
far
it
is
difficult
to
help
it
when
they
become
parents
your
mistress
could
tell
you
if
she
would
own
the
truth
that
she
sees
her
son
manly
beauty
already
under
that
little
wry
mouth
and
that
odd
button
of
a
nose
why
may
not
i
just
as
well
fancy
him
a
young
surgeon
morris
would
say
as
she
once
said
to
me
observed
margaret
death
my
dear
remember
death
we
will
remember
it
said
morris
but
we
must
remember
at
the
same
time
god
mercy
in
giving
life
he
who
gave
life
can
preserve
it
and
this
shall
be
my
trust
for
you
all
my
dears
when
i
am
far
away
from
you
there
is
a
knock
i
must
go
oh
miss
margaret
who
will
there
be
to
go
to
the
door
when
i
am
gone
but
you
mr
jones
had
knocked
at
the
door
and
left
a
letter
these
were
its
contents
sir
i
hope
you
will
excuse
the
liberty
i
take
in
applying
to
you
for
my
own
satisfaction
my
wife
and
i
have
perceived
with
much
concern
that
we
have
lost
much
of
your
custom
of
late
we
mind
little
the
mere
falling
off
of
custom
in
any
quarter
in
comparison
with
failing
to
give
satisfaction
we
have
always
tried
i
am
sure
to
give
satisfaction
in
our
dealings
with
your
family
sir
and
if
there
has
been
any
offence
i
can
assure
you
it
is
unintentional
and
shall
feel
obliged
by
knowing
what
it
is
we
can
not
conceive
sir
where
you
get
your
meat
if
not
from
us
and
if
you
have
the
trouble
of
buying
it
from
a
distance
i
can
only
say
we
should
be
happy
to
save
you
the
trouble
if
we
knew
how
to
serve
you
to
your
liking
for
sir
we
have
a
great
respect
for
you
and
yours
your
obedient
servants
john
jones
mary
jones
the
kind
soul
cried
hester
what
must
we
say
to
them
we
must
set
their
minds
at
ease
about
our
to
them
how
that
little
fellow
stares
about
him
like
a
child
of
double
his
age
i
do
believe
i
could
make
him
look
wise
at
my
watch
already
yes
we
must
set
the
joneses
at
ease
at
all
events
but
how
we
must
not
tell
them
that
we
can
not
afford
to
buy
of
them
as
we
did
no
that
would
be
begging
we
must
trust
to
their
delicacy
not
to
press
too
closely
for
a
reason
when
once
assured
that
we
respect
them
as
highly
as
they
possibly
can
us
you
may
trust
them
said
margaret
i
am
convinced
they
will
look
in
your
face
and
be
satisfied
without
further
question
and
my
advice
therefore
is
that
you
do
not
write
but
go
i
will
and
now
they
shall
not
suffer
a
moment
pain
that
i
can
save
them
my
boy
what
you
have
not
learned
to
kiss
yet
well
among
us
all
you
will
soon
know
how
if
teaching
will
do
it
what
a
spirit
he
has
i
fancy
he
will
turn
out
like
frank
chapter
thirty
nine
the
long
nights
almost
as
soon
as
hope
had
left
the
house
sydney
grey
arrived
looking
full
of
importance
he
took
care
to
shut
the
door
before
he
would
tell
his
errand
his
mother
had
been
obliged
to
trust
him
for
want
of
another
messenger
and
he
delivered
his
message
with
a
little
of
the
parade
of
mystery
he
had
derived
from
her
mr
grey
family
had
become
uneasy
about
his
returning
from
the
markets
in
the
evening
since
robberies
had
become
so
frequent
as
they
now
were
and
the
days
so
short
and
had
at
length
persuaded
him
to
sleep
at
the
more
distant
he
had
to
visit
and
return
the
next
morning
from
blickley
he
could
get
home
before
the
evening
closed
in
but
on
two
days
in
the
week
he
was
to
remain
out
all
night
when
he
had
agreed
to
this
his
family
had
applauded
him
and
felt
satisfied
but
as
the
evening
drew
on
on
occasion
of
this
his
first
absence
mrs
grey
and
sophia
had
grown
nervous
on
their
own
account
they
recalled
story
after
story
which
they
had
lately
heard
of
robberies
at
several
solitary
houses
in
the
country
round
and
though
their
house
was
not
solitary
they
could
not
reconcile
themselves
to
going
to
rest
without
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
there
was
as
usual
a
strong
man
on
their
premises
if
they
had
been
aware
how
many
strong
men
there
were
sometimes
on
their
premises
at
night
they
would
not
have
been
satisfied
with
having
one
within
their
walls
not
having
been
informed
however
how
cleverly
their
dogs
were
silenced
how
much
poached
game
was
divided
under
the
shelter
of
their
stacks
of
deals
and
what
dextrous
abstractions
were
at
such
times
made
from
the
store
of
corn
in
their
granaries
and
coal
in
their
lighters
they
proposed
nothing
further
than
to
beg
the
favour
of
mr
hope
that
he
would
take
a
bed
in
their
house
for
this
one
night
they
dared
not
engage
any
of
the
men
from
the
yards
to
defend
them
they
had
not
mr
grey
leave
and
he
might
not
be
pleased
if
they
showed
any
fear
to
their
own
servants
but
it
would
be
the
greatest
comfort
if
mr
hope
would
come
as
if
to
supper
and
stay
the
night
the
spare
room
was
ready
and
mrs
grey
hoped
he
would
not
object
to
leaving
his
family
just
for
once
mr
grey
intended
to
do
the
same
thing
twice
a
week
till
the
days
should
lengthen
and
the
roads
become
safer
though
sydney
made
the
most
of
his
message
he
declared
himself
not
thoroughly
pleased
with
it
they
might
have
trusted
me
to
take
care
of
them
said
he
if
they
had
just
let
me
have
my
father
pistols
come
come
sydney
do
not
talk
of
pistols
said
hester
who
did
not
relish
any
part
of
the
affair
he
would
not
talk
of
them
if
he
thought
they
were
likely
to
be
wanted
observed
margaret
likely
when
were
they
ever
more
likely
to
be
wanted
i
should
like
to
know
did
you
hear
what
happened
at
the
russell
taylors
last
night
no
and
we
do
not
wish
to
hear
do
not
tell
us
any
horrible
stories
unless
you
mean
my
husband
to
stay
at
home
oh
you
must
just
hear
this
because
it
ended
well
that
is
nobody
was
killed
mr
walcot
told
sophia
all
about
it
this
morning
and
it
was
partly
that
which
made
her
so
anxious
to
have
some
one
sleep
in
the
house
well
then
do
not
tell
us
or
you
will
make
us
anxious
for
the
same
thing
what
would
your
mother
say
if
you
were
to
carry
home
word
that
mr
hope
could
not
come
that
his
family
dare
not
part
with
him
oh
then
she
must
let
me
have
my
father
pistols
and
watch
for
the
fellows
if
they
came
about
our
windows
as
they
did
about
the
russell
taylors
how
i
would
let
fly
among
them
they
came
rapping
at
the
shutters
at
two
this
morning
and
when
mr
taylor
looked
out
from
his
bedroom
above
they
said
they
would
not
trouble
themselves
to
get
in
if
he
would
throw
out
his
money
and
did
he
yes
they
raised
a
hat
upon
a
pole
and
he
put
in
four
or
five
pounds
all
he
had
in
the
house
he
told
them
so
they
went
away
but
none
of
the
family
thought
of
going
to
bed
again
i
dare
say
not
and
what
sort
of
thieves
are
these
supposed
to
be
they
set
about
their
business
very
oddly
not
like
london
thieves
said
sydney
consequentially
as
if
he
knew
all
about
london
thieves
they
are
the
distressed
country
people
no
doubt
such
as
would
no
more
think
of
standing
a
second
shot
from
my
pistol
than
of
keeping
the
straits
of
thermopylae
look
here
he
continued
showing
the
end
of
a
pistol
which
peeped
from
a
pocket
inside
his
coat
here
a
thing
that
will
put
such
gentry
into
a
fine
taking
pray
is
that
pistol
loaded
inquired
hester
pressing
her
infant
to
her
to
be
sure
what
is
the
use
of
a
pistol
if
it
is
not
loaded
it
might
as
well
be
in
the
shop
as
in
my
pocket
then
look
at
her
cousin
margaret
if
she
is
not
in
as
great
a
fright
as
the
cowardly
thieves
why
cousin
hester
do
you
see
if
this
pistol
went
off
it
would
not
shoot
you
or
the
baby
it
would
go
straight
through
me
that
is
a
great
comfort
but
i
had
rather
you
would
go
away
you
and
your
pistol
pray
does
your
mother
know
that
you
carry
one
no
mind
you
do
tell
her
i
trust
you
not
to
tell
her
remember
i
would
not
have
told
you
if
i
had
not
felt
sure
of
you
you
had
better
not
have
felt
sure
of
us
however
we
will
not
tell
your
mother
but
my
husband
will
tell
mr
grey
when
he
comes
home
if
he
chooses
that
you
should
carry
loaded
pistols
about
there
will
be
no
harm
done
i
have
a
great
mind
to
say
i
will
shoot
you
if
you
tell
cried
sydney
presenting
the
pistol
with
a
grand
air
but
he
saw
that
he
made
his
cousins
really
uneasy
and
he
laid
it
down
on
the
table
offering
to
leave
it
with
them
for
the
night
if
they
thought
it
would
make
them
feel
any
safer
there
were
plenty
more
at
home
thank
you
said
margaret
but
i
believe
we
are
more
afraid
of
loaded
pistols
than
of
thieves
the
sooner
you
take
it
away
the
better
you
can
go
now
presently
for
here
comes
my
brother
sydney
quickly
pocketed
his
pistol
hope
agreed
to
go
and
promised
to
be
at
mr
grey
to
supper
by
nine
margaret
was
incessantly
thinking
of
maria
in
these
long
evenings
when
alarms
of
one
kind
or
another
were
all
abroad
she
now
thought
she
would
go
with
sydney
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
maria
returning
by
the
time
her
brother
would
be
going
to
the
greys
maria
landlord
would
see
her
home
no
doubt
she
found
her
friend
busy
with
book
and
needle
and
as
well
in
health
as
usual
but
obviously
somewhat
moved
by
the
dismal
stories
which
had
travelled
from
mouth
to
mouth
through
deerbrook
during
the
day
it
seemed
hardly
right
that
any
person
in
delicate
health
should
be
lonely
at
such
a
time
and
it
occurred
to
margaret
that
her
friend
might
like
to
go
home
with
her
and
occupy
the
bed
which
was
this
night
to
spare
maria
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
and
let
margaret
put
up
her
little
bundle
for
her
the
farrier
escorted
them
to
the
steps
of
the
and
then
left
them
the
door
was
as
morris
was
talking
with
some
one
on
the
mat
in
the
hall
an
extremely
tall
woman
with
a
crying
baby
in
her
arms
made
way
for
the
ladies
not
by
going
out
of
the
house
but
by
stepping
further
into
the
hall
morris
had
you
not
better
shut
the
door
said
margaret
the
wind
blows
in
so
it
is
enough
to
chill
the
whole
house
but
morris
held
the
door
open
rather
wider
than
before
so
the
gentleman
is
not
at
home
said
the
tall
woman
gruffly
if
i
come
again
in
an
hour
with
my
poor
baby
will
he
be
at
home
then
is
my
brother
gone
morris
yes
miss
three
minutes
ago
then
he
will
not
be
back
in
an
hour
we
do
not
expect
him
this
good
woman
had
better
go
to
mr
walcot
as
i
have
been
telling
her
there
no
doubt
he
is
at
home
i
could
wait
here
till
the
gentleman
comes
home
said
the
tall
woman
and
so
get
the
first
advice
for
my
poor
baby
is
very
ill
better
go
to
mr
walcot
persisted
morris
or
to
my
brother
at
mr
grey
said
margaret
unwilling
to
lose
the
chance
of
a
new
patient
for
edward
and
thinking
his
advice
better
for
the
child
sake
than
mr
walcot
it
is
far
the
readiest
way
to
go
to
mr
walcot
declared
maria
whose
arm
margaret
felt
to
tremble
within
her
own
i
believe
you
are
right
said
margaret
you
had
better
not
waste
any
more
time
here
good
woman
it
may
make
all
the
difference
to
your
child
if
you
would
let
me
wait
till
the
gentleman
comes
home
said
the
tall
woman
impossible
it
is
too
late
for
patients
to
wait
this
landlord
without
there
will
show
you
the
way
to
mr
walcot
call
him
morris
morris
went
out
upon
the
steps
but
the
tall
woman
passed
her
and
was
gone
morris
stepped
in
briskly
and
put
up
the
chain
you
were
very
ready
to
send
a
new
patient
to
mr
walcot
morris
said
margaret
smiling
i
had
a
fancy
that
it
was
a
sort
of
patient
that
my
master
would
not
be
the
better
for
replied
morris
i
did
not
like
the
looks
of
the
person
nor
i
said
maria
the
door
was
heard
to
open
and
morris
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
hester
had
been
alone
nearly
ten
minutes
she
was
growing
nervous
and
wanted
to
know
what
all
this
talking
in
the
hall
was
about
she
was
told
that
mr
hope
had
been
inquired
for
about
a
sick
baby
and
the
rest
of
the
discourse
went
to
the
account
of
maria
unexpected
arrival
hester
welcomed
maria
kindly
ordered
up
the
cold
pheasant
and
the
wine
and
then
leaving
the
friends
to
enjoy
themselves
over
the
fire
retired
to
rest
morris
was
desired
to
go
too
as
she
still
slept
in
her
mistress
room
and
ought
to
keep
early
hours
since
in
addition
to
her
labours
of
the
day
she
was
at
the
baby
call
in
the
night
margaret
would
see
her
friend
to
her
room
morris
must
not
remain
up
on
their
account
how
comfortable
this
is
cried
maria
in
a
gleeful
tone
as
she
looked
round
upon
the
crackling
fire
the
tray
the
wine
and
her
companion
how
unlooked
for
to
pass
a
whole
evening
and
night
without
being
afraid
of
anything
what
an
admission
from
you
that
you
are
afraid
of
something
every
night
that
is
just
the
plain
truth
when
i
used
to
read
about
the
horrors
of
living
in
a
solitary
house
in
the
country
i
little
thought
how
much
of
the
same
terror
i
should
feel
from
living
solitary
in
a
house
in
a
village
you
wonder
what
could
happen
to
me
i
dare
say
and
perhaps
it
would
not
be
very
easy
to
suppose
any
peril
which
would
stand
examination
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
and
we
are
particularly
safe
from
being
so
poor
that
there
is
no
inducement
to
rob
us
we
and
you
have
neither
money
nor
jewels
nor
plate
that
can
tempt
thieves
for
our
few
forks
and
spoons
are
hardly
worth
breaking
into
a
house
for
people
who
want
bread
however
may
think
it
worth
while
to
break
in
for
that
and
while
our
thieves
are
this
sort
of
people
and
not
the
london
gentry
whom
sydney
is
so
fond
of
talking
of
it
may
be
enough
that
gentlemen
and
ladies
live
in
houses
to
make
the
starving
suppose
that
they
shall
find
something
valuable
there
they
would
soon
learn
better
if
they
came
here
i
doubt
whether
when
you
and
i
have
done
our
supper
they
would
find
anything
to
eat
but
how
do
you
show
your
terrors
i
should
like
to
know
do
you
scream
i
never
screamed
in
my
life
as
far
as
i
remember
screaming
appears
to
me
the
most
unnatural
of
human
sounds
i
never
felt
the
slightest
inclination
to
express
myself
in
that
manner
nor
i
but
i
never
said
so
because
i
thought
no
one
would
believe
me
no
the
true
mood
for
these
doleful
winter
nights
is
to
sit
trying
to
read
but
never
able
to
fix
your
attention
for
five
minutes
for
some
odd
noise
or
another
and
yet
it
is
almost
worse
to
hear
nothing
but
a
cinder
falling
on
the
hearth
now
and
then
startling
you
like
a
then
it
seems
as
if
somebody
was
opening
the
shutter
outside
and
then
tapping
at
the
window
i
have
got
so
into
the
habit
of
looking
at
the
window
at
night
expecting
to
see
a
face
squeezed
flat
against
the
pane
that
i
have
yielded
up
my
credit
to
myself
and
actually
have
the
blinds
drawn
down
when
the
outside
shutters
are
closed
how
glad
i
am
to
find
you
are
no
braver
than
the
rest
of
us
no
do
not
be
glad
it
is
very
painful
night
after
night
every
step
clinks
or
craunches
in
the
farrier
yard
you
know
this
ought
to
be
a
comfort
but
sometimes
i
can
not
clearly
tell
where
the
sound
comes
from
more
than
once
lately
i
have
fancied
it
was
behind
me
and
have
turned
round
in
a
greater
hurry
than
you
would
think
i
could
use
my
rooms
are
a
good
way
from
the
rest
of
the
house
you
remember
the
length
of
the
passage
between
i
do
not
like
disturbing
the
family
in
the
evenings
but
i
have
been
selfish
enough
to
ring
once
or
twice
this
week
without
any
sufficient
reason
just
for
the
sake
of
a
sight
of
my
landlady
a
very
sufficient
reason
but
i
had
no
idea
of
all
this
from
you
you
have
heard
me
say
some
fine
things
about
the
value
of
time
to
me
about
the
blessings
of
my
long
evenings
for
all
that
true
as
it
is
i
have
got
into
the
way
of
going
to
bed
soon
after
ten
just
because
i
know
every
one
else
in
the
house
is
in
bed
and
i
do
not
like
to
be
the
only
person
up
that
is
the
reason
why
you
are
looking
so
well
notwithstanding
all
these
terrors
but
maria
what
has
become
of
your
bravery
it
is
just
where
it
was
i
am
no
more
afraid
than
i
used
to
be
of
evils
which
may
be
met
with
a
mature
mind
and
just
as
much
afraid
as
ever
of
those
which
terrified
my
childhood
our
baby
shall
never
be
afraid
of
anything
asserted
margaret
but
maria
something
must
be
done
for
your
relief
that
is
just
what
i
hoped
and
expected
you
would
say
and
the
reason
why
i
exposed
myself
to
you
why
do
not
the
greys
offer
you
a
room
there
for
the
winter
that
seems
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
plan
it
is
not
convenient
how
should
that
be
the
bed
would
have
to
be
uncovered
you
know
and
the
mahogany
might
be
splashed
they
can
get
a
room
ready
for
a
guest
to
relieve
their
own
fears
but
not
yours
can
nothing
be
done
about
it
not
unless
the
rowlands
should
take
in
mr
walcot
because
he
is
afraid
to
live
alone
in
such
case
the
greys
would
take
me
in
for
the
same
reason
but
that
will
not
be
so
margaret
i
will
ask
you
plainly
and
you
will
answer
as
plainly
could
you
without
too
much
pain
trouble
and
inconvenience
spend
an
evening
or
two
a
week
with
me
just
till
this
panic
is
passed
if
you
could
put
it
in
my
power
to
be
always
looking
forward
to
an
evening
of
relief
it
would
break
the
sense
of
solitude
and
make
all
the
difference
to
me
i
see
the
selfishness
of
this
but
i
really
think
it
is
better
to
own
my
weakness
than
to
struggle
uselessly
against
it
any
longer
i
could
do
that
should
like
of
all
things
to
do
it
till
morris
goes
but
that
will
be
so
soon
morris
where
is
she
going
margaret
related
this
piece
of
domestic
news
too
private
to
be
told
to
any
one
else
till
the
last
moment
maria
forgot
her
own
troubles
or
despised
them
as
she
listened
so
grieved
was
she
for
her
friends
including
morris
margaret
was
not
very
sorry
on
morris
own
account
morris
wanted
rest
an
easier
place
she
had
had
too
much
upon
her
for
some
time
past
what
then
will
you
have
when
she
is
gone
if
i
have
work
enough
to
drive
all
thought
out
of
my
head
i
shall
be
thankful
meantime
i
will
bestow
my
best
wit
upon
your
case
i
am
ashamed
of
my
case
already
while
sitting
in
all
this
comfort
here
i
can
hardly
believe
in
my
own
tremors
of
no
earlier
date
than
last
night
come
let
us
draw
to
the
fire
i
hope
we
shall
not
end
with
sitting
up
all
night
but
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
it
very
much
margaret
stirred
up
a
blaze
and
put
out
the
candles
no
economy
was
now
beneath
her
care
as
she
took
her
seat
beside
her
friend
she
said
maria
did
you
ever
know
any
place
so
dull
and
dismal
as
deerbrook
is
now
is
it
not
enough
to
make
any
heart
as
heavy
as
the
fortunes
of
the
place
even
the
little
that
i
see
of
it
in
going
to
and
from
the
greys
looks
sad
enough
you
see
the
outskirts
which
i
suppose
are
worse
still
the
very
air
feels
too
heavy
to
breathe
the
cottages
and
even
the
better
houses
appear
to
my
eyes
damp
and
on
the
outside
and
silent
within
the
children
sit
shivering
on
the
thresholds
do
not
they
instead
of
shouting
at
their
play
as
they
did
every
one
looks
discontented
and
complains
the
poor
of
want
of
bread
and
every
one
else
of
hard
times
and
all
manner
of
woes
that
one
never
hears
of
in
prosperous
seasons
mr
james
says
the
actions
for
trespass
are
beyond
all
example
mr
tucker
declares
his
dog
that
died
the
other
day
was
poisoned
and
i
never
pass
the
green
but
the
women
are
even
quarrelling
for
precedence
at
the
pump
i
have
witnessed
some
of
this
but
not
all
and
neither
i
suspect
have
you
margaret
though
you
think
you
have
we
see
the
affairs
of
the
world
in
shadow
you
know
when
our
own
hearts
are
sad
my
heart
is
not
so
sad
as
you
think
you
do
not
believe
me
but
that
is
because
you
do
not
believe
what
i
am
sure
of
that
he
is
not
to
blame
for
anything
that
has
happened
that
at
least
he
has
only
been
mistaken
that
there
his
been
no
fickleness
no
selfishness
in
him
i
could
not
speak
of
this
even
to
you
maria
if
it
were
not
a
duty
to
him
you
must
not
be
left
to
suppose
from
my
silence
that
he
is
to
blame
as
you
think
he
is
i
suffer
from
no
sense
of
injury
from
him
i
got
over
that
long
ago
maria
would
not
say
as
she
thought
you
had
to
get
over
it
then
it
makes
me
very
unhappy
to
think
how
he
is
suffering
how
much
more
he
has
to
bear
than
i
so
much
more
than
the
separation
and
the
blank
he
can
not
trust
me
as
i
trusted
him
and
that
is
indeed
to
be
without
consolation
do
men
ever
trust
as
women
do
yes
edward
does
if
he
were
to
go
to
india
for
twenty
years
he
would
know
as
certainly
as
i
should
that
hester
would
be
widowed
in
every
thought
till
his
return
and
the
time
will
come
when
philip
will
know
this
as
certainly
of
me
it
is
but
a
little
while
yet
that
i
have
waited
maria
but
it
does
sometimes
seem
a
weary
waiting
maria
took
her
friend
hand
in
token
of
the
sympathy
she
could
not
speak
so
much
of
hopelessness
was
there
mingled
with
it
i
know
you
and
others
think
that
this
waiting
is
to
go
on
for
ever
no
love
not
so
or
that
a
certainty
which
is
even
worse
will
come
some
day
but
it
will
be
otherwise
his
love
can
no
more
be
quenched
or
alienated
by
the
slanders
of
a
wicked
woman
than
the
sun
can
be
put
out
by
an
eclipse
or
sent
to
enlighten
another
world
leaving
us
mourning
you
judge
by
your
own
soul
margaret
and
that
should
be
a
faithful
guide
you
judge
him
by
your
own
soul
and
how
much
by
this
she
added
with
a
smile
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
turquoise
ring
which
was
philip
gift
and
which
safely
guarded
was
on
a
finger
of
the
hand
she
held
margaret
blushed
she
could
not
have
denied
if
closely
pressed
that
some
little
tinge
of
the
eastern
superstition
had
entered
into
this
sacred
ring
and
lay
there
like
the
fire
in
the
opal
she
could
not
have
denied
that
when
she
drew
it
on
every
morning
she
noted
with
satisfaction
that
its
blue
was
as
clear
and
bright
as
ever
how
is
it
that
this
ring
is
still
here
asked
maria
is
it
possible
that
he
retains
gifts
of
yours
yet
i
think
if
he
did
not
this
ring
would
not
be
on
your
finger
he
does
keep
whatever
i
gave
him
thank
god
he
keeps
them
this
is
one
of
my
greatest
comforts
it
is
the
only
way
i
have
left
of
speaking
to
him
but
if
it
were
not
so
this
ring
would
still
be
where
it
is
i
would
not
give
it
up
i
am
not
altered
i
am
not
angry
with
him
his
love
is
as
precious
to
me
as
it
ever
was
and
i
will
not
give
up
the
tokens
of
it
why
maria
you
surely
can
not
suppose
that
these
things
have
any
other
value
or
use
but
as
given
by
him
you
can
not
suppose
that
i
dread
the
imputation
of
keeping
them
for
their
own
sakes
no
but
but
what
is
any
proof
of
his
former
regard
of
value
now
that
is
the
question
it
has
only
very
lately
become
a
question
with
me
i
have
only
lately
learned
to
think
him
in
fault
i
excused
him
before
i
excused
him
as
long
as
i
could
you
will
unlearn
your
present
opinion
of
him
yes
everything
that
was
ever
valuable
from
him
is
more
precious
than
ever
now
now
that
he
is
under
a
spell
and
can
not
speak
his
soul
if
it
were
as
you
think
if
he
loved
me
no
longer
they
would
be
still
more
precious
as
a
relic
of
the
dead
but
it
is
not
so
if
faith
can
remove
mountains
we
may
have
to
rejoice
for
you
still
margaret
for
there
can
be
no
mass
of
calumnies
between
you
and
him
which
you
have
not
faith
enough
to
overthrow
thank
you
for
that
it
is
the
best
word
of
comfort
that
has
come
to
me
from
without
for
many
a
day
now
there
is
one
thing
more
in
which
you
can
perhaps
help
me
i
have
heard
nothing
about
him
for
so
long
you
see
mr
rowland
sometimes
i
know
he
feels
a
great
friendship
for
you
and
you
meet
the
younger
children
do
you
hear
nothing
whatever
about
nothing
nor
do
they
mr
rowland
told
me
a
fortnight
ago
that
mrs
rowland
and
he
are
seriously
uneasy
at
obtaining
no
answers
to
their
repeated
letters
to
mr
enderby
mrs
rowland
is
more
disturbed
i
believe
than
she
chooses
to
show
she
must
feel
herself
responsible
she
has
tried
various
means
of
accounting
for
his
silence
all
the
autumn
now
she
gives
that
up
and
is
silent
in
her
turn
if
it
were
not
for
the
impossibility
of
leaving
home
at
such
a
time
as
this
mr
rowland
would
go
to
london
to
satisfy
himself
margaret
i
believe
you
are
the
only
person
who
has
smiled
at
this
perhaps
i
am
the
only
one
who
understands
him
i
had
rather
know
of
this
silence
than
of
all
the
letters
he
could
have
written
to
mrs
rowland
if
he
had
been
ill
they
would
certainly
have
heard
yes
they
say
so
then
that
is
enough
let
us
say
no
more
now
you
have
said
that
which
has
cheered
me
for
you
margaret
though
as
we
poor
irreligious
human
beings
often
say
to
each
other
wish
i
had
your
faith
you
have
given
me
more
than
i
had
however
but
are
we
to
say
no
more
about
anything
must
we
leave
this
comfortable
fire
and
go
to
sleep
not
unless
you
wish
it
i
have
more
to
ask
if
you
are
not
tired
come
ask
me
can
not
you
tell
me
of
some
way
in
which
a
woman
may
earn
money
a
woman
what
rate
of
woman
do
you
mean
yourself
that
question
is
easily
answered
a
woman
from
the
uneducated
classes
can
get
a
subsistence
by
washing
and
cooking
by
milking
cows
and
going
to
service
and
in
some
parts
of
the
kingdom
by
working
in
a
cotton
mill
or
burnishing
plate
as
you
have
no
doubt
seen
for
yourself
at
birmingham
but
for
an
educated
woman
a
woman
with
the
powers
which
god
gave
her
religiously
improved
with
a
reason
which
lays
life
open
before
her
an
understanding
which
surveys
science
as
its
appropriate
task
and
a
conscience
which
would
make
every
species
of
responsibility
safe
for
such
a
woman
there
is
in
all
england
no
chance
of
subsistence
but
by
teaching
that
almost
ineffectual
teaching
which
can
never
countervail
the
education
of
circumstances
and
for
which
not
one
in
a
thousand
is
fit
or
by
being
a
superior
miss
nares
the
feminine
gender
of
the
tailor
and
the
hatter
the
tutor
the
tailor
and
the
hatter
is
this
all
all
except
that
there
are
departments
of
art
and
literature
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
shut
women
out
these
are
not
however
to
be
regarded
as
resources
for
bread
besides
the
number
who
succeed
in
art
and
literature
being
necessarily
extremely
small
it
seems
pretty
certain
that
no
great
achievements
in
the
domains
of
art
and
imagination
can
be
looked
for
from
either
men
or
women
who
labour
there
to
supply
their
lower
wants
or
for
any
other
reason
than
the
pure
love
of
their
work
while
they
toil
in
any
one
of
the
arts
of
expression
if
they
are
not
engrossed
by
some
loftier
meaning
the
highest
which
they
will
end
with
expressing
will
be
the
need
of
bread
true
quite
true
i
must
not
think
of
any
of
those
higher
departments
of
labour
because
even
if
i
were
qualified
what
i
want
is
not
employment
but
money
i
am
anxious
to
earn
some
money
maria
we
are
very
poor
edward
is
trying
one
way
and
another
to
earn
money
to
live
upon
till
his
practice
comes
back
to
him
as
he
is
for
ever
trusting
it
will
i
wish
to
earn
something
too
if
it
be
ever
so
little
can
you
tell
me
of
no
way
i
believe
i
should
not
if
i
could
why
because
i
think
you
have
quite
enough
to
do
already
and
will
soon
have
too
much
just
consider
when
morris
goes
what
hour
of
the
day
will
you
have
to
spare
let
us
see
do
you
mean
to
sweep
the
rooms
with
your
own
hands
yes
said
margaret
smiling
and
to
scour
them
too
no
not
quite
that
we
shall
hire
a
neighbour
to
come
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
do
the
rougher
parts
of
the
work
but
i
mean
to
light
the
fire
in
the
morning
and
we
shall
have
but
one
and
get
breakfast
ready
and
hester
will
help
me
to
make
the
beds
that
is
nearly
all
i
shall
let
her
do
besides
the
sewing
for
baby
will
give
her
employment
enough
indeed
i
think
so
and
that
will
leave
you
too
much
do
not
think
dear
of
earning
money
you
are
doing
all
you
ought
in
saving
it
i
must
think
about
it
because
earning
is
so
much
nobler
and
more
effectual
than
saving
i
can
not
help
seeing
that
it
would
be
far
better
to
earn
the
amount
of
morris
maintenance
than
to
save
it
by
doing
her
work
badly
myself
not
that
i
shrink
from
the
labour
i
am
rather
enjoying
the
prospect
of
it
as
i
told
you
hark
what
footstep
is
that
i
heard
it
a
minute
or
two
ago
whispered
maria
but
i
did
not
like
to
mention
it
they
listened
in
the
deepest
silence
for
a
while
at
first
they
were
not
sure
whether
they
heard
anything
above
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
but
they
were
soon
certain
that
there
were
feet
moving
outside
the
room
door
the
church
clock
has
but
lately
gone
twelve
said
maria
in
the
faint
hope
that
it
might
be
some
one
of
the
household
yet
stirring
margaret
shook
her
head
she
rose
softly
from
her
seat
and
took
a
candle
from
the
table
to
light
it
saying
she
would
go
and
see
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
she
held
the
match
and
the
candle
would
not
immediately
light
meantime
the
door
opened
without
noise
and
some
one
walked
in
and
quite
up
to
the
gazing
ladies
it
was
the
tall
woman
maria
made
an
effort
to
reach
the
bell
but
the
tall
woman
seized
her
arm
and
made
her
sit
down
a
capricious
jet
of
flame
from
a
coal
in
the
fire
at
this
moment
lighted
up
the
face
of
the
stranger
for
a
moment
and
enabled
maria
to
spy
a
creat
peard
under
the
muffler
what
do
you
want
at
this
time
said
margaret
i
want
money
and
what
else
i
can
get
said
the
intruder
in
the
no
longer
disguised
voice
of
a
man
i
have
been
into
your
larder
but
you
seem
to
have
nothing
there
that
is
true
said
margaret
firmly
nor
have
we
any
money
we
are
very
poor
you
could
not
have
come
to
a
worse
place
if
you
are
in
want
here
is
something
however
said
the
man
turning
to
the
tray
with
your
leave
i
see
what
you
have
left
us
to
eat
he
thrust
one
of
the
candles
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
to
light
it
telling
the
ladies
they
had
better
start
no
difficulty
lest
they
should
have
reason
to
repent
it
there
were
others
with
him
in
the
house
who
would
show
themselves
in
an
instant
if
any
noise
were
made
then
do
you
make
none
i
beg
it
as
a
favour
said
margaret
there
is
a
lady
asleep
with
a
very
young
infant
if
you
respect
her
life
you
will
be
quiet
the
man
did
not
answer
but
he
was
quiet
he
cut
slices
from
the
loaf
and
carried
them
to
the
door
and
they
were
taken
by
somebody
outside
he
quickly
devoured
the
remains
of
the
pheasant
tearing
the
meat
from
the
bones
with
his
teeth
he
drank
from
the
decanter
of
wine
and
then
carried
it
where
he
had
taken
the
bread
two
men
put
their
heads
in
at
the
door
nodded
to
the
ladies
before
they
drank
and
again
withdrew
the
girls
cast
a
look
at
each
other
a
glance
of
agreement
that
resistance
was
not
to
be
thought
of
yet
each
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
rather
pleasant
surprise
that
she
was
not
more
alarmed
now
for
it
said
the
man
striding
oddly
about
in
his
petticoats
and
evidently
out
of
patience
with
them
now
for
your
money
as
he
spoke
he
put
the
spoons
from
the
tray
into
the
bosom
of
his
gown
proceeding
to
murmur
at
his
deficiency
of
pockets
margaret
held
out
her
purse
to
him
it
contained
one
single
shilling
you
do
mean
this
is
all
you
are
going
to
give
me
it
is
all
i
have
and
i
believe
there
is
not
another
shilling
in
the
house
i
told
you
we
have
no
money
and
you
said
he
turning
to
maria
i
have
not
my
purse
about
me
and
if
i
had
there
is
nothing
in
it
worth
your
taking
i
assure
you
i
have
not
got
my
purse
i
am
only
a
visitor
here
for
this
one
night
and
an
odd
night
it
is
to
have
chosen
as
it
turns
out
give
me
your
watches
i
have
no
watch
i
have
not
had
a
watch
these
five
years
said
maria
i
have
no
watch
said
margaret
i
sold
mine
a
month
ago
i
told
you
we
were
very
poor
the
man
muttered
something
about
the
plague
of
gentlefolks
being
so
poor
and
about
wondering
that
gentlefolks
were
not
ashamed
of
being
so
poor
you
have
got
something
however
he
continued
fixing
his
eye
on
the
ring
on
margaret
finger
give
me
that
ring
give
it
me
or
else
i
take
it
margaret
heart
sank
with
a
worse
than
her
grief
when
she
remembered
how
easily
she
might
have
saved
this
ring
how
easily
she
might
have
thrust
it
under
the
fender
or
dropped
it
into
her
shoe
into
her
hair
anywhere
while
the
intruder
was
gone
to
the
room
door
to
his
companions
she
felt
that
she
could
never
forgive
herself
for
this
neglect
of
the
most
precious
thing
she
had
in
the
world
of
that
which
most
belonged
to
philip
she
can
not
part
with
that
ring
said
maria
look
you
may
see
she
had
rather
part
with
any
money
she
is
ever
likely
to
have
than
with
that
ring
she
pointed
to
margaret
who
was
sitting
with
her
hands
clasped
as
if
they
were
never
to
be
disjoined
and
with
a
face
of
the
deepest
distress
i
ca
help
that
said
the
man
i
must
have
what
i
can
get
he
seized
her
hands
and
with
one
gripe
of
his
made
hers
fly
open
margaret
could
no
longer
endure
to
expose
any
of
her
feelings
to
the
notice
of
a
stranger
of
this
character
be
patient
a
moment
said
she
and
she
drew
off
the
ring
after
its
guard
made
of
hester
hair
and
put
them
into
the
large
hand
which
was
held
out
to
receive
them
feeling
at
the
moment
as
if
her
heart
was
breaking
the
man
threw
the
hair
ring
back
into
her
lap
and
tied
the
turquoise
in
the
corner
of
the
shawl
he
wore
the
lady
has
got
a
watch
i
suppose
yes
she
has
let
me
go
and
fetch
it
do
let
me
go
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
so
much
as
her
being
terrified
if
you
have
any
humanity
let
me
go
indeed
i
will
bring
the
watch
well
there
is
no
man
in
the
house
i
know
for
you
to
call
you
may
go
miss
but
i
must
step
behind
you
to
the
room
door
no
further
she
sha
see
me
nor
know
any
one
is
there
unless
you
tell
her
this
young
lady
will
sit
as
still
as
a
mouse
till
we
come
back
never
mind
me
said
maria
to
her
friend
while
they
were
gone
she
sat
as
she
was
desired
as
still
as
a
mouse
enforced
thereto
by
the
certainty
that
a
man
stood
in
the
shadow
by
the
door
with
his
eye
upon
her
the
whole
time
margaret
lighted
a
chamber
candle
in
order
as
she
said
to
look
as
usual
if
her
sister
should
see
her
the
robber
did
tread
very
softly
on
the
stairs
and
stop
outside
the
morris
was
sitting
up
in
her
evidently
listening
and
was
on
the
point
of
starting
out
of
it
on
seeing
that
margaret
face
was
pale
when
margaret
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
motioned
to
her
to
lie
down
hester
was
asleep
with
her
sleeping
infant
on
her
arm
margaret
set
down
the
light
and
leaned
over
her
to
take
the
watch
from
its
hook
at
the
head
of
the
bed
are
you
still
up
said
hester
drowsily
and
just
opening
her
eyes
what
do
you
want
it
must
be
very
late
nearly
twelve
by
your
watch
i
am
sorry
i
disturbed
you
as
she
withdrew
with
the
watch
in
her
hand
she
whispered
to
morris
lie
still
do
be
uneasy
i
will
come
again
presently
so
in
a
few
minutes
as
seemed
to
intently
listening
ears
the
house
was
clear
of
the
intruders
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
margaret
had
beckoned
morris
out
of
hester
room
and
had
explained
the
case
to
her
they
went
round
the
house
and
found
that
all
the
little
plate
they
had
was
gone
and
the
cheese
from
the
pantry
morris
cloth
cloak
was
left
hanging
on
its
pin
and
even
edward
old
hat
from
these
circumstances
and
from
the
dialect
of
the
only
speaker
margaret
thought
the
thieves
must
be
country
people
from
the
neighbourhood
who
could
not
wear
the
old
clothes
of
the
gentry
without
danger
of
detection
they
had
come
in
from
the
surgery
whose
outer
door
was
sufficiently
distant
from
the
inhabited
rooms
of
the
house
to
be
forced
without
the
noise
being
heard
morris
and
margaret
barricaded
this
door
as
well
as
they
could
with
such
chests
and
benches
as
they
were
able
to
move
without
making
themselves
heard
and
then
morris
at
margaret
earnest
desire
stole
back
to
bed
anything
rather
than
alarm
hester
while
they
were
below
maria
had
put
on
more
coals
and
restored
some
order
and
comfort
to
the
table
and
the
fireside
she
concluded
that
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
for
this
night
for
some
moments
after
margaret
came
and
sat
down
by
her
neither
of
them
spoke
at
length
margaret
said
half
laughing
that
you
should
have
come
here
for
rest
this
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
i
am
glad
it
happened
so
yes
indeed
i
am
i
know
it
must
have
been
a
comfort
to
you
to
have
some
one
with
you
though
only
poor
lame
me
and
i
am
glad
on
my
own
account
too
i
assure
you
such
a
visitation
is
not
half
so
dreadful
as
i
had
fancied
not
worth
half
the
fear
i
have
spent
upon
it
all
my
life
i
am
sure
you
felt
as
i
did
while
he
was
here
you
felt
quite
yourself
did
not
you
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
woman
clothes
it
would
really
have
been
scarcely
terrifying
at
all
there
is
something
much
more
human
about
a
housebreaker
than
i
had
fancied
but
yet
it
was
very
inhuman
of
him
to
take
your
ring
margaret
wept
more
bitterly
than
any
one
had
seen
her
weep
since
her
unhappy
days
began
and
her
friend
could
not
comfort
her
it
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
comfort
to
be
given
unless
in
the
very
faint
and
unreasonable
hope
that
the
ring
might
be
offered
for
sale
to
some
jeweller
in
some
market
town
in
the
county
a
hope
sadly
faint
and
unreasonable
since
country
people
who
would
take
plate
and
ornaments
must
in
all
probability
be
in
communication
with
london
rogues
who
would
turn
the
property
into
money
in
the
great
city
still
there
was
a
possibility
of
recovering
the
lost
treasure
and
on
this
possibility
maria
dwelt
perseveringly
but
margaret
she
went
on
to
ask
what
is
this
about
your
watch
have
you
indeed
sold
it
yes
morris
managed
that
for
me
while
hester
was
confined
i
am
glad
now
that
i
parted
with
it
as
i
did
it
has
paid
some
bills
which
i
know
made
edward
anxious
and
that
is
far
better
than
its
being
in
a
housebreaker
hands
yes
indeed
but
i
am
sorry
you
all
have
such
a
struggle
to
live
not
a
shilling
in
the
house
but
the
one
you
gave
up
so
much
for
edward
being
out
it
happened
very
well
for
he
could
not
have
helped
us
if
he
had
been
here
you
saw
there
were
three
of
them
what
i
meant
was
that
edward
has
about
him
the
little
money
that
is
to
last
us
till
christmas
the
rent
is
safe
enough
it
is
in
mr
grey
strong
box
or
the
bank
at
blickley
the
rent
is
too
important
a
matter
to
be
put
to
any
hazard
considering
that
mr
rowland
is
our
landlord
it
is
all
ready
and
safe
that
is
well
now
margaret
could
you
swear
to
this
visitor
of
ours
no
said
margaret
softly
looking
round
as
if
to
convince
herself
that
he
was
not
there
still
no
his
bonnet
was
so
large
and
he
kept
the
shadow
of
it
so
carefully
upon
his
face
that
i
should
not
know
him
again
at
least
not
in
any
other
dress
and
we
shall
never
see
him
again
in
this
it
is
very
disagreeable
she
continued
shuddering
slightly
to
think
that
we
may
pass
him
any
day
or
every
day
and
that
he
may
say
to
himself
as
we
go
by
go
the
ladies
that
sat
with
their
feet
on
the
fender
so
comfortably
when
i
went
in
without
leave
poor
wretch
he
will
rather
say
goes
the
young
lady
that
i
made
so
unhappy
about
her
ring
i
wish
i
had
choked
with
the
wine
i
drank
before
i
took
that
ring
the
first
man
you
meet
that
can
not
look
you
in
the
face
is
the
thief
depend
upon
it
margaret
i
must
not
depend
upon
that
but
maria
could
you
swear
to
him
i
am
not
quite
sure
at
this
moment
but
i
believe
i
could
the
light
from
the
fire
shone
brightly
upon
his
black
chin
and
a
bit
of
lank
hair
that
came
from
under
his
mob
cap
i
could
swear
to
the
shawl
so
could
i
but
that
will
be
burned
morning
now
maria
do
go
to
bed
well
if
you
had
rather
can
not
we
be
together
must
i
be
treated
as
a
guest
and
have
a
room
to
myself
not
if
you
think
we
can
make
room
in
mine
we
shall
be
most
comfortable
there
shall
not
we
near
to
morris
and
hester
rather
than
separate
they
both
betook
themselves
to
the
bed
in
margaret
room
maria
lay
still
as
if
asleep
but
wide
awake
and
listening
margaret
mourned
her
turquoise
with
silent
tears
all
the
rest
of
the
night
chapter
forty
lightsome
days
before
he
returned
home
in
the
morning
hope
went
to
dr
levitt
to
report
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
on
mr
grey
premises
in
the
course
of
the
night
he
was
persuaded
that
several
persons
had
been
about
the
yards
and
he
had
seen
a
light
appearing
and
disappearing
among
the
shrubs
which
grew
thick
in
the
rear
of
the
house
sydney
and
he
had
examined
the
premises
this
morning
in
company
with
mr
clerk
and
they
had
found
the
trampled
and
drops
of
tallow
from
a
candle
which
had
probably
been
taken
out
of
a
lantern
and
ashes
from
scattered
under
the
lee
of
a
pile
of
logs
nothing
was
missed
from
the
yards
it
was
probable
that
they
were
the
resort
of
persons
who
had
been
plundering
elsewhere
but
the
danger
from
fire
was
so
great
and
the
unpleasantness
of
having
such
night
neighbours
so
extreme
that
the
gentlemen
agreed
that
no
time
must
be
lost
in
providing
a
watch
which
would
keep
the
premises
clear
of
intruders
the
dog
which
had
by
some
means
been
cajoled
out
of
his
duty
must
be
replaced
by
a
more
faithful
one
and
dr
levitt
was
disposed
to
establish
a
patrol
in
the
village
the
astonishment
of
both
was
great
when
margaret
appeared
early
as
it
was
with
her
story
it
was
the
faint
hope
of
recovering
her
ring
which
brought
her
thus
early
to
the
magistrate
her
brother
was
satisfied
to
stay
and
listen
when
he
found
that
hester
knew
as
yet
nothing
of
the
matter
it
was
a
clear
case
that
the
greys
must
find
some
other
guardian
for
the
nights
that
mr
grey
spent
from
home
and
dr
levitt
said
that
no
man
was
justified
in
leaving
his
family
unprotected
for
a
single
night
in
such
times
as
these
he
spoke
with
the
deepest
concern
of
the
state
of
the
neighbourhood
this
winter
and
of
his
own
inability
to
preserve
security
by
his
influence
either
as
clergyman
or
magistrate
the
fact
was
he
said
that
neither
law
nor
gospel
could
deter
men
from
crime
when
pressed
by
want
and
hardened
against
all
other
claims
by
those
of
their
starving
families
such
times
had
never
been
known
within
his
remembrance
and
the
guardians
of
the
public
peace
and
safety
were
almost
as
much
at
their
wits
end
as
the
sickly
and
savage
population
they
had
to
control
he
must
consult
with
as
many
of
his
brother
magistrates
as
he
could
reach
as
to
what
could
be
done
for
the
general
security
and
relief
as
hope
and
margaret
returned
home
to
breakfast
they
agreed
that
their
little
household
was
more
free
to
discharge
the
duties
of
such
a
time
than
most
of
their
neighbours
of
their
own
rank
could
possibly
be
they
had
now
little
or
nothing
of
which
they
could
be
robbed
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
how
they
could
be
further
injured
they
might
now
wholly
free
from
fear
and
devote
themselves
to
forgive
and
serve
their
neighbours
such
emancipation
from
care
as
is
the
blessing
of
poverty
even
more
than
of
wealth
was
theirs
and
as
a
great
blessing
in
the
midst
of
very
tolerable
evil
they
felt
it
margaret
laughed
as
she
asked
edward
if
he
could
spare
a
few
pence
to
buy
horn
spoons
in
the
village
as
all
the
silver
ones
were
gone
hester
was
not
at
all
too
much
alarmed
or
disturbed
when
she
missed
her
watch
and
heard
what
had
happened
she
was
chiefly
vexed
that
she
had
slept
through
it
all
it
seemed
so
ridiculous
that
the
master
of
the
house
should
be
safe
at
a
distance
and
the
mistress
comfortably
asleep
during
such
an
event
leaving
it
to
sister
maid
and
guest
to
bear
all
the
terror
of
it
dr
levitt
absence
of
mind
did
not
interfere
with
the
activity
of
his
heart
or
with
his
penetration
in
cases
where
the
hearts
of
others
were
concerned
he
perceived
that
the
lost
turquoise
was
from
some
cause
inestimable
to
margaret
and
he
spared
no
pains
to
recover
it
but
weeks
passed
on
without
any
tidings
of
it
margaret
told
herself
that
she
must
give
up
this
as
she
had
given
up
so
much
else
with
as
much
cheerfulness
as
she
could
but
she
missed
her
ring
every
hour
of
the
day
christmas
came
and
the
expected
contest
took
place
about
the
rent
of
the
mr
rowland
showed
his
lady
the
on
the
morning
of
and
then
immediately
and
secretly
sent
them
back
mrs
rowland
had
never
been
so
sorry
to
see
yet
she
would
have
been
so
angry
at
their
being
returned
that
her
husband
concealed
the
fact
from
her
within
an
hour
the
money
was
in
mr
rowland
hands
again
with
a
request
that
he
would
desist
from
pressing
favours
upon
those
who
could
not
but
consider
them
as
pecuniary
obligation
and
not
as
justice
mr
rowland
sighed
turned
the
key
of
his
desk
upon
the
money
and
set
forth
to
the
to
see
whether
no
repairs
were
wanted
whether
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
as
landlord
to
promote
the
comfort
and
security
of
his
excellent
tenants
christmas
came
and
morris
found
she
could
not
leave
her
young
ladies
while
the
days
were
so
very
short
she
would
receive
no
wages
after
christmas
and
she
would
take
care
that
she
cost
them
next
to
nothing
but
she
could
not
be
easy
to
go
till
brighter
days
days
externally
brighter
at
least
were
at
hand
nor
till
the
baby
was
a
little
less
tender
and
had
shown
beyond
dispute
that
he
was
likely
to
be
a
stout
little
fellow
she
could
not
think
of
miss
margaret
getting
up
quite
in
the
dark
to
light
the
fire
it
was
a
dismal
time
to
begin
such
a
new
sort
of
work
margaret
privately
explained
to
her
that
these
little
circumstances
brought
no
discouragement
to
persons
who
undertake
such
labour
with
sufficient
motive
and
morris
admitted
this
she
saw
the
difference
between
the
case
of
a
poor
girl
first
going
to
service
who
trembles
half
the
night
at
the
idea
of
her
mistress
displeasure
if
she
should
not
happen
to
wake
in
time
such
poor
girl
undertaking
service
for
a
maintenance
and
by
no
means
from
love
in
either
party
towards
the
other
morris
saw
the
difference
between
the
morning
waking
to
such
a
service
and
margaret
being
called
from
her
bed
by
love
of
those
whom
she
was
going
to
serve
through
the
day
and
by
an
exhilarating
sense
of
honour
and
duty
morris
saw
that
while
to
the
solitary
dependant
every
accessory
of
cheerfulness
is
necessary
to
make
her
willingly
leave
her
rest
the
early
sunshine
through
her
window
and
the
morning
songs
of
birds
it
mattered
little
to
margaret
under
what
circumstances
she
went
about
her
business
whether
in
darkness
or
in
light
in
keen
frost
or
genial
warmth
she
had
the
strength
of
will
in
whose
glow
all
the
disgust
all
the
meanness
all
the
hardship
of
the
most
sordid
occupations
is
consumed
leaving
unimpaired
the
dignity
and
delight
of
toil
morris
saw
and
fully
admitted
all
this
and
yet
she
stayed
on
till
the
end
of
january
by
that
time
her
friends
were
not
satisfied
to
have
her
remain
any
longer
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
earn
money
and
she
had
an
opportunity
now
of
earning
what
she
needed
at
birmingham
the
time
was
come
when
morris
must
go
the
family
had
their
sorrow
all
to
themselves
that
dismal
evening
for
not
a
soul
in
deerbrook
except
maria
knew
that
morris
was
going
at
all
maria
had
known
all
along
and
it
had
been
settled
that
maria
should
occupy
morris
room
after
it
was
vacated
as
often
as
she
felt
nervous
and
lonely
in
her
lodging
but
she
was
not
aware
of
the
precise
day
when
the
separation
of
these
old
and
dear
friends
was
to
take
place
so
they
mourned
morris
as
privately
as
she
had
long
grieved
over
their
adversity
mr
hope
meant
to
drive
morris
to
buckley
himself
and
to
see
her
into
the
coach
for
birmingham
and
he
had
borrowed
mr
grey
gig
for
the
purpose
he
had
been
urged
by
mr
grey
not
to
think
of
returning
that
night
had
desired
his
wife
and
sister
not
to
expect
him
and
had
engaged
a
neighbour
to
sleep
in
the
house
the
sisters
might
well
look
forward
to
a
sad
evening
and
their
hearts
were
heavy
when
the
gig
came
to
the
door
when
they
were
fortifying
morris
with
a
parting
glass
of
wine
and
wrapping
her
up
with
warm
things
which
were
to
come
back
with
her
master
and
expressing
their
by
the
tenderness
with
which
they
melted
the
very
soul
of
poor
morris
she
could
not
speak
she
could
resist
nothing
she
took
all
they
offered
her
to
comfort
herself
with
from
having
neither
heart
nor
voice
to
refuse
morris
never
gave
way
to
tears
but
she
was
as
solemn
as
if
she
were
going
to
execution
the
baby
alone
was
insensible
to
her
gravity
he
laughed
in
her
face
when
she
took
him
into
her
arms
for
the
last
time
a
seasonable
laugh
it
was
for
it
relieved
his
mother
of
some
slight
superstitious
dread
which
was
stealing
upon
her
as
she
witnessed
the
solemnity
of
morris
farewell
to
him
they
all
spoke
of
her
return
to
them
but
no
one
felt
that
there
was
any
comfort
in
so
vague
a
hope
amidst
the
sadness
of
the
present
certainty
as
hester
and
margaret
stood
out
on
the
steps
to
watch
the
gig
till
the
last
moment
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
driven
against
their
faces
they
feared
morris
would
have
a
dreary
journey
and
this
was
not
the
pleasantest
thought
to
carry
with
them
into
the
house
while
hester
nursed
her
infant
by
the
fire
margaret
went
round
the
house
to
see
what
there
was
for
her
to
do
it
moved
her
to
find
how
thoughtfully
everything
was
done
busy
as
morris
had
been
with
a
thousand
little
affairs
and
preparations
every
part
of
the
house
was
left
in
the
completest
order
the
very
blinds
of
the
chambers
were
drawn
down
and
a
fire
was
laid
in
every
grate
in
case
of
its
being
wanted
the
was
set
in
the
pantry
and
not
a
plate
left
from
dinner
unwashed
margaret
felt
and
said
how
badly
she
should
supply
the
place
of
morris
hands
to
say
nothing
of
their
loss
of
her
head
and
heart
she
sighed
her
thankfulness
to
her
old
friend
that
she
was
already
at
liberty
to
sit
down
beside
her
sister
with
actually
nothing
on
her
hands
to
be
done
before
it
was
always
a
holiday
to
margaret
when
she
could
sit
by
at
leisure
as
the
morning
and
evening
dressing
and
undressing
of
the
baby
went
on
hester
would
never
entrust
the
business
to
her
or
to
any
one
but
it
was
the
next
best
thing
to
watch
the
pranks
of
the
little
fellow
and
the
play
between
him
and
his
mother
and
then
to
see
the
fun
subside
into
drowsiness
and
be
lost
in
that
exquisite
spectacle
the
quiet
sleep
of
an
infant
when
he
was
this
evening
laid
in
his
basket
and
all
was
unusually
still
from
there
being
no
one
but
themselves
in
the
house
and
the
snow
having
by
this
time
fallen
thickly
outside
margaret
said
to
her
sister
if
i
remember
rightly
it
is
just
a
twelvemonth
since
you
warned
me
how
wretched
marriage
was
just
a
year
is
it
not
is
it
possible
said
hester
withdrawing
her
eyes
from
her
infant
i
wish
i
could
have
foreseen
then
how
soon
i
might
remind
you
of
this
is
it
possible
that
i
said
so
and
of
all
marriage
of
all
love
and
all
marriage
i
remember
it
distinctly
you
have
but
too
much
reason
to
remember
it
love
but
how
thankless
how
wicked
of
me
ever
to
say
so
we
all
perhaps
say
some
wretched
things
which
dwell
on
other
minds
long
after
we
have
forgotten
them
ourselves
it
is
one
of
the
acts
we
shall
waken
up
to
as
sins
perhaps
every
one
of
us
whenever
we
become
qualified
to
review
our
lives
dispassionately
as
sins
no
doubt
for
the
pain
does
not
die
with
the
utterance
and
to
give
pain
needlessly
and
to
give
lasting
pain
is
surely
a
sin
we
are
none
of
us
guiltless
but
i
am
glad
you
said
this
particular
thing
dreadful
as
it
was
to
hear
it
it
has
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
thought
within
the
year
and
it
now
makes
us
both
aware
how
much
happier
we
are
than
we
were
then
we
yes
all
of
us
i
rather
shrink
from
measuring
states
of
fortune
and
of
mind
as
they
are
at
one
time
against
those
of
another
but
it
is
impossible
to
recall
that
warning
of
yours
and
be
unaware
how
differently
we
have
cause
to
think
and
speak
now
i
felt
at
the
time
that
it
was
too
late
for
us
to
complain
of
love
and
of
marriage
the
die
was
then
cast
for
us
all
it
is
much
better
to
feel
now
that
those
complaints
were
the
expression
of
passing
pain
long
since
over
i
rejoice
to
hear
you
say
this
for
yourself
margaret
though
i
own
i
should
scarcely
have
expected
it
and
yet
no
one
is
more
aware
than
i
that
it
is
a
blessing
to
love
a
blessing
still
whatever
may
be
the
woe
that
must
come
with
the
love
it
is
a
blessing
to
live
for
another
to
feel
far
more
deeply
than
the
most
selfish
being
on
earth
ever
felt
for
himself
i
know
that
it
is
better
to
have
felt
this
disinterested
attachment
to
another
even
in
the
midst
of
storms
of
passion
hidden
in
the
heart
and
of
pangs
from
disappointment
than
to
live
on
in
the
very
best
peace
of
those
who
have
never
loved
yet
knowing
this
i
have
been
cowardly
for
you
margaret
and
at
one
time
sank
under
my
own
troubles
any
one
who
loved
as
i
did
should
have
been
braver
i
should
have
been
more
willing
both
for
you
and
for
myself
to
meet
the
suffering
which
belongs
to
the
exercise
of
all
the
highest
and
best
part
of
our
nature
but
i
was
unworthy
then
of
the
benignant
discipline
appointed
to
me
and
at
the
moment
i
doubt
not
i
should
have
preferred
if
the
choice
had
been
offered
to
me
the
safety
and
quiet
of
a
passionless
existence
to
the
glorious
exercise
which
has
been
graciously
appointed
me
against
my
will
i
do
try
now
margaret
to
be
thankful
that
you
have
had
some
of
this
exercise
and
discipline
but
i
have
not
faith
enough
my
thanks
are
all
up
in
grief
before
i
have
done
grief
that
you
have
the
struggle
and
the
sorrow
without
the
support
and
the
full
return
which
have
been
granted
to
me
you
need
not
grieve
much
for
me
i
have
not
only
had
the
full
return
you
speak
of
but
i
have
it
still
it
can
not
be
spoken
or
written
or
even
indulged
but
i
know
it
exists
and
therefore
am
i
happier
than
i
was
last
year
how
foolish
it
is
she
continued
as
if
thinking
aloud
how
perfectly
childish
to
set
our
hearts
on
what
we
call
happiness
on
any
arrangement
of
circumstances
either
in
our
minds
or
our
fortunes
so
little
as
we
know
how
you
and
i
should
have
dreaded
this
night
and
if
they
could
have
been
foreshown
to
us
a
while
ago
how
we
should
have
shrunk
from
sitting
down
under
the
cloud
of
sorrow
which
appears
to
have
settled
upon
this
house
and
now
this
evening
has
come
the
evening
of
morris
going
away
and
everything
else
so
dreary
no
servant
no
money
no
prospect
careful
economy
at
home
abroad
the
times
bad
the
future
all
blank
we
two
sitting
here
alone
with
the
snow
falling
without
and
our
hearts
aching
with
parting
with
morris
we
must
come
back
to
that
principal
grief
how
dismal
all
this
would
have
looked
if
we
could
have
seen
it
in
a
at
birmingham
long
ago
and
yet
i
would
not
change
this
very
evening
for
any
we
ever
spent
in
birmingham
when
we
were
exceedingly
proud
of
being
very
happy
nor
i
this
is
life
and
to
live
to
live
with
the
whole
soul
and
mind
and
strength
is
enough
it
is
not
often
that
i
have
strength
to
feel
this
and
courage
to
say
it
but
i
have
both
and
in
time
we
may
be
strong
enough
to
pray
that
this
child
may
truly
and
wholly
live
may
live
in
every
capacity
of
his
being
whatever
suffering
may
be
the
condition
of
such
life
but
it
requires
some
courage
to
pray
so
for
him
he
looks
so
unfit
for
anything
but
ease
at
present
for
anything
but
feeding
and
sleeping
and
laughing
in
our
faces
did
you
ever
see
an
infant
sleep
so
softly
are
not
those
wheels
passing
yes
surely
i
heard
wheels
rolling
over
the
snow
she
was
right
in
five
minutes
more
margaret
had
to
open
the
door
to
her
brother
hope
had
arrived
at
blickley
only
just
in
time
to
drive
morris
up
to
the
door
of
the
birmingham
coach
and
put
her
in
as
the
guard
was
blowing
his
horn
mr
grey
horse
had
gone
badly
and
they
had
been
full
late
in
setting
off
he
had
not
liked
the
prospect
of
staying
where
he
was
till
morning
and
had
resolved
to
bid
defiance
to
footpads
and
return
so
he
stepped
into
the
and
read
the
papers
while
the
horse
was
feeding
and
came
home
as
quickly
after
as
he
could
as
he
was
safe
all
the
three
were
glad
he
had
done
so
and
the
more
that
for
once
edward
seemed
sad
they
made
a
bright
fire
and
gave
him
tea
but
their
household
offices
did
not
seem
to
cheer
him
as
usual
hester
asked
at
length
whether
he
had
heard
any
bad
news
only
public
news
the
papers
are
full
of
everything
that
is
dismal
the
epidemic
is
spreading
frightfully
it
is
a
most
serious
affair
the
people
you
meet
in
the
streets
at
blickley
look
as
if
they
had
the
plague
raging
in
the
town
they
say
the
funerals
have
never
ceased
passing
through
the
streets
all
this
week
and
really
the
churchyard
i
saw
seemed
full
of
new
graves
i
believe
the
case
is
little
better
in
any
town
in
the
kingdom
and
in
the
villages
the
villages
follow
of
course
with
differences
according
to
their
circumstances
none
will
be
worse
than
this
place
when
once
the
fever
appears
among
us
i
would
not
say
so
anywhere
but
by
our
own
fireside
because
everything
should
be
done
to
encourage
the
people
instead
of
frightening
them
but
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
place
better
prepared
for
destruction
than
our
pretty
village
is
just
now
from
the
extreme
poverty
of
most
of
the
people
and
their
ignorance
which
renders
them
unfit
to
take
any
rational
care
of
themselves
you
say
the
fever
comes
do
you
think
it
must
certainly
come
yes
and
i
have
had
some
suspicions
within
a
day
or
two
that
it
is
here
already
i
must
see
walcot
and
learn
what
he
has
discovered
in
his
practice
mr
walcot
will
not
dr
levitt
do
as
well
i
must
see
dr
levitt
too
to
consult
about
some
means
of
cleansing
and
drying
the
worst
of
the
houses
in
the
village
but
it
is
quite
necessary
that
i
should
have
some
conversation
with
walcot
about
the
methods
of
treatment
of
this
dreadful
disease
if
he
is
not
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
consulting
with
a
brother
in
the
profession
he
ought
to
be
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
be
for
he
will
very
soon
have
as
much
upon
him
as
any
head
and
hands
in
the
world
could
manage
can
not
you
let
him
come
to
you
for
advice
and
assistance
when
he
wants
it
i
must
not
wait
for
that
he
is
young
and
as
we
all
imagine
not
over
wise
and
a
dozen
of
our
poor
neighbours
might
die
before
he
became
aware
of
as
much
as
i
know
about
this
epidemic
no
love
my
dignity
must
give
way
to
the
safety
of
our
neighbours
depend
upon
it
walcot
will
be
glad
enough
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
if
not
by
next
week
at
furthest
so
soon
what
makes
you
say
next
week
i
judge
partly
from
the
rate
of
progress
of
the
fever
elsewhere
and
partly
from
the
present
state
of
health
in
deerbrook
there
are
other
reasons
too
i
have
seen
some
birds
of
ill
omen
on
the
wing
hitherward
this
evening
what
can
you
mean
i
mean
are
you
not
aware
that
in
seasons
of
plague
of
the
epidemics
of
our
times
as
well
as
the
plagues
of
former
days
conjurors
and
and
quacks
appear
as
a
sort
of
heralds
of
the
disease
they
are
not
really
so
for
the
disease
in
fact
precedes
them
but
they
show
themselves
so
immediately
on
its
arrival
and
usually
before
its
presence
is
acknowledged
that
they
have
often
been
thought
to
bring
it
they
have
early
information
of
its
existence
in
any
place
and
they
come
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
panic
of
the
inhabitants
where
there
are
enough
who
are
ignorant
to
make
the
speculation
a
good
one
i
saw
two
parties
of
these
people
trooping
hither
and
we
shall
have
heard
something
of
their
prophecies
and
of
a
fever
case
or
two
before
this
time
i
have
little
doubt
it
is
this
prospect
which
has
made
you
sad
said
hester
no
my
dear
not
that
alone
but
do
not
let
us
talk
about
being
sad
what
does
it
matter
yes
do
let
us
talk
about
it
said
margaret
if
as
i
suspect
you
are
sad
for
us
it
is
about
morris
going
away
is
it
not
about
many
things
it
is
impossible
to
be
at
all
times
unaffected
by
such
changes
as
have
come
upon
us
i
can
not
always
forget
what
my
profession
once
was
to
me
for
honour
for
occupation
and
for
income
i
confidently
reckoned
on
bringing
you
both
to
a
home
full
of
comfort
never
were
women
so
cherished
as
i
meant
that
you
should
be
and
now
it
has
ended
in
your
little
incomes
being
almost
our
only
resource
and
in
your
being
deprived
of
your
old
friend
morris
some
years
before
her
time
i
can
hardly
endure
to
think
of
and
do
you
really
call
this
the
end
asked
margaret
do
you
consider
our
destiny
fixed
for
evermore
as
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
love
said
hester
to
him
i
could
almost
wish
that
this
were
the
end
i
feel
as
if
almost
any
change
would
be
for
the
worse
i
mean
supposing
you
not
to
look
as
you
do
now
but
as
you
have
always
been
till
now
oh
edward
i
am
so
happy
her
husband
could
not
speak
for
astonishment
and
delight
you
remember
that
evening
in
verdon
woods
edward
the
evening
before
we
were
married
remember
it
well
how
infinitely
happier
are
we
now
than
then
oh
that
fear
that
mistrust
of
myself
you
reproved
me
for
my
fear
and
mistrust
then
and
i
must
beg
leave
to
remind
you
of
what
you
then
said
it
is
not
often
that
i
can
have
the
honour
of
preaching
to
you
my
dear
husband
as
it
is
rather
difficult
to
find
an
occasion
but
now
i
have
caught
you
tripping
what
is
there
for
you
to
be
uneasy
about
now
that
can
at
all
be
compared
with
what
i
troubled
myself
about
then
since
that
time
i
have
caused
you
much
misery
i
know
misery
which
i
partly
foresaw
i
should
cause
you
but
that
is
over
i
trust
it
is
over
at
least
for
the
time
that
we
are
poor
and
persecuted
i
dare
not
and
do
not
wish
for
anything
otherwise
than
as
we
have
it
flow
persecution
seems
to
have
made
us
wiser
and
poverty
happier
and
how
if
only
margaret
were
altogether
as
we
would
see
her
how
could
we
be
better
than
we
are
you
are
right
my
dear
wife
these
few
tender
words
and
her
husband
brightened
looks
sufficed
hester
had
no
cares
she
forgot
even
the
fever
in
seeing
edward
look
as
gay
as
usual
again
and
in
feeling
that
she
was
everything
to
that
feeling
that
conviction
for
which
she
had
sighed
in
vain
for
long
after
her
marriage
she
had
then
fancied
that
his
profession
his
family
his
own
thoughts
were
as
important
to
him
as
herself
she
now
knew
that
she
was
supreme
and
this
was
supreme
satisfaction
when
margaret
sprang
up
to
her
new
labours
in
the
chill
dusk
of
the
next
morning
she
flattered
herself
that
she
was
the
first
awake
but
it
was
not
so
when
she
went
down
she
found
her
brother
busy
shovelling
the
snow
away
and
making
a
clear
path
from
the
kitchen
door
to
the
he
declared
it
delightfully
warm
work
by
the
time
he
had
brought
in
coals
enough
for
the
day
and
wanted
more
employment
of
the
same
sort
he
went
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
cleared
the
steps
and
pavement
there
caring
nothing
for
the
fact
that
two
or
three
neighbours
gazed
from
their
doors
and
that
some
children
stood
blowing
upon
their
fingers
and
stamping
with
their
feet
enduring
the
cold
for
the
sake
of
seeing
the
gentleman
clearing
his
own
steps
what
would
the
greys
say
asked
margaret
laughing
as
duster
in
hand
she
looked
from
the
open
window
and
spoke
to
her
brother
outside
i
am
sure
they
ought
to
say
i
have
done
my
work
well
that
is
just
what
hester
is
observing
within
here
you
are
almost
ready
for
breakfast
are
you
not
she
is
setting
the
table
quite
ready
what
warm
work
this
is
really
i
do
not
believe
there
is
such
a
bit
of
pavement
in
all
deerbrook
as
this
of
ours
come
come
in
to
breakfast
you
have
admired
your
work
quite
enough
for
this
morning
the
three
who
sat
down
to
breakfast
were
as
reasonable
and
philosophical
as
most
people
but
even
they
were
taken
by
surprise
with
the
sweetness
of
comforts
provided
by
their
own
immediate
toil
there
was
something
in
the
novelty
perhaps
but
hope
threw
on
the
fire
with
remarkable
energy
the
coals
he
had
himself
brought
in
from
the
and
ate
with
great
relish
the
toast
toasted
by
his
wife
own
hands
margaret
too
looked
round
the
room
more
than
once
with
a
new
sort
of
pride
in
there
being
not
a
particle
of
dust
on
table
chair
or
book
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
persuade
edward
that
there
was
nothing
more
for
him
to
do
about
the
house
till
the
next
morning
that
the
would
come
in
an
hour
and
clean
the
shoes
and
that
the
only
assistance
the
master
of
the
house
could
render
would
be
to
take
charge
of
the
baby
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
hester
helped
her
sister
to
make
the
beds
after
breakfast
when
hester
was
dressing
her
infant
and
margaret
washing
up
the
and
saucers
the
postman
knock
was
heard
margaret
went
to
the
door
and
paid
for
the
letter
from
the
emergency
purse
as
they
called
the
little
sum
of
money
they
had
put
aside
for
unforeseen
expenses
the
letter
was
for
edward
and
so
brief
that
it
must
be
on
business
it
was
on
business
it
was
from
the
lawyer
of
mr
hope
aged
grandfather
and
it
told
that
the
old
gentleman
had
at
last
sunk
rather
suddenly
under
his
many
infirmities
mr
hope
was
invited
to
go
not
to
the
funeral
for
it
must
be
over
before
he
could
arrive
but
to
see
the
will
in
which
he
had
a
large
beneficial
interest
the
property
being
divided
between
himself
and
his
brother
subject
to
legacies
of
one
hundred
pounds
to
each
of
his
sisters
and
a
few
smaller
bequests
to
the
servants
this
is
as
you
always
feared
said
hester
to
her
husband
observing
the
expression
of
concern
in
his
face
on
reading
the
letter
indeed
i
always
feared
it
would
be
so
he
replied
i
did
what
i
could
to
prevent
this
act
of
posthumous
injustice
and
i
am
grieved
that
i
failed
for
nothing
can
repair
it
my
sisters
will
have
their
money
the
same
in
amount
but
how
different
in
value
they
will
receive
it
as
a
gift
from
their
brothers
instead
of
as
their
due
from
their
grandfather
i
am
very
sorry
his
last
act
was
of
this
character
will
you
go
must
you
go
no
i
shall
not
go
at
least
not
at
present
the
funeral
would
be
over
you
see
before
i
could
get
there
and
i
doubt
not
the
rest
of
the
business
may
be
managed
quietly
and
easily
by
letter
i
have
no
inclination
to
travel
just
now
and
no
money
to
do
it
with
and
strong
reasons
of
another
kind
for
staying
at
home
no
i
shall
not
go
i
am
very
glad
now
the
first
duty
is
to
write
to
emily
and
anne
i
suppose
and
to
frank
not
to
frank
just
yet
he
knows
what
i
meant
to
do
in
case
of
my
grandfather
recurring
to
this
disposition
of
his
property
and
further
than
this
i
must
not
influence
frank
he
must
be
left
entirely
free
to
do
as
he
thinks
proper
and
i
shall
not
communicate
with
him
till
he
has
had
ample
time
to
decide
on
his
course
i
shall
write
to
emily
and
anne
i
am
sorry
for
them
so
am
i
what
a
pity
it
is
when
the
aged
whom
one
would
wish
to
honour
after
they
are
gone
to
their
graves
impair
one
respect
by
an
unjust
arrangement
of
their
affairs
how
easily
might
my
grandfather
have
satisfied
us
all
and
secured
our
due
reverence
at
the
last
by
merely
being
just
now
after
admitting
what
was
just
he
has
gone
back
into
his
prejudices
and
placed
us
all
in
a
painful
position
from
which
it
will
be
difficult
to
every
one
of
us
to
regard
his
memory
as
we
should
wish
he
little
thought
you
would
look
upon
his
rich
legacy
in
this
way
said
margaret
smiling
i
gave
him
warning
that
i
should
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
it
more
peremptorily
than
i
did
that
must
be
your
satisfaction
now
love
you
have
done
everything
that
was
right
so
we
will
not
discompose
ourselves
because
another
has
done
a
wrong
which
you
can
partly
repair
my
dear
wife
what
comfort
you
give
what
a
blessing
it
is
that
you
think
and
feel
and
will
act
with
me
making
my
duty
easy
instead
of
difficult
i
was
going
to
ask
observed
margaret
whether
you
have
no
misgiving
no
doubt
whatever
that
you
are
right
in
refusing
all
this
money
not
the
slightest
doubt
margaret
the
case
is
not
in
any
degree
altered
by
my
change
of
fortune
the
facts
remain
that
my
sisters
have
received
nothing
yet
from
the
property
while
i
have
had
my
professional
education
out
of
it
that
my
profession
does
not
at
present
supply
us
with
bread
does
not
affect
the
question
at
all
nor
can
you
think
that
it
does
i
am
sure
but
hester
my
love
what
think
you
of
our
prospect
of
a
hundred
pounds
a
hundred
pounds
yes
that
is
the
sum
set
down
for
me
when
the
honest
will
was
made
and
that
sum
i
shall
of
course
retain
oh
delightful
what
a
quantity
of
comfort
we
may
get
out
of
a
hundred
pounds
how
rich
we
shall
be
she
is
thinking
already
said
margaret
what
sort
of
a
pretty
cloak
baby
is
to
have
for
the
summer
and
margaret
must
have
something
out
of
it
must
not
she
love
asked
hester
we
will
all
enjoy
it
with
many
thanks
to
my
poor
grandfather
surely
this
hundred
pounds
will
set
us
on
through
the
year
that
will
be
very
pleasant
really
observed
margaret
to
be
sure
of
bread
for
all
the
rest
of
the
year
oh
the
value
of
a
hundred
pounds
to
some
people
what
a
pity
that
morris
did
not
stay
this
one
other
day
exclaimed
hester
and
yet
perhaps
not
so
it
might
have
perplexed
her
mind
about
leaving
us
and
induced
her
to
give
up
her
new
place
and
there
is
nothing
in
a
chance
hundred
pounds
to
justify
that
it
is
better
as
it
is
all
things
are
very
well
as
they
are
said
hope
as
long
as
we
think
so
now
i
am
going
to
call
on
walcot
stop
stop
one
moment
stay
and
see
what
i
have
found
cried
his
wife
in
a
tone
of
glee
look
feel
tell
me
is
not
this
our
first
tooth
it
is
it
certainly
is
i
give
you
joy
my
little
fellow
worth
all
the
hundreds
of
pounds
in
the
world
observed
margaret
coming
in
her
turn
to
see
and
feel
the
little
pearly
edge
whose
value
its
owner
was
far
from
appreciating
while
worried
with
the
inquisition
which
was
made
into
the
mysteries
of
his
mouth
now
it
a
pity
that
morris
is
not
here
all
exclaimed
we
must
write
to
her
perhaps
we
might
have
found
it
yesterday
if
we
had
had
any
idea
it
would
come
so
soon
no
hester
was
quite
positive
there
was
no
tooth
to
be
seen
or
felt
last
night
well
we
must
write
to
morris
you
must
leave
me
a
corner
said
hope
we
must
all
try
our
skill
in
describing
a
first
tooth
i
will
consider
my
part
as
i
walk
bite
my
finger
once
more
before
i
go
my
boy
the
sisters
busied
themselves
in
putting
the
parlour
in
order
for
the
reception
of
any
visitors
who
might
chance
to
call
though
the
streets
were
so
deep
in
snow
as
to
render
the
chance
a
remote
one
margaret
believed
that
when
the
time
should
come
she
might
set
the
potatoes
over
the
parlour
fire
to
boil
and
thus
without
detection
save
the
lighting
another
fire
but
before
she
had
taken
off
her
apron
while
she
was
in
the
act
of
sweeping
up
the
hearth
there
was
a
loud
knock
which
she
recognised
as
proceeding
from
the
hand
of
a
grey
the
family
resemblance
extended
to
their
knocks
at
the
door
as
if
no
snow
had
fallen
mrs
grey
and
sophia
entered
you
are
surprised
to
see
us
my
dears
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
could
not
be
satisfied
without
knowing
what
mr
hope
thinks
of
this
epidemic
this
terrible
fever
which
every
one
is
speaking
about
so
frightfully
why
what
can
he
think
i
mean
my
dear
does
he
suppose
that
it
will
come
here
are
we
likely
to
have
it
he
tells
us
what
i
suppose
you
hear
from
mr
grey
that
the
fever
seems
to
be
spreading
everywhere
and
is
just
now
very
destructive
at
buckley
does
not
mr
grey
tell
you
so
no
indeed
there
is
no
learning
anything
from
mr
grey
that
he
does
not
like
to
tell
sophia
i
think
we
must
take
in
a
newspaper
again
that
we
may
stand
a
chance
of
knowing
something
sophia
agreed
sophia
and
i
found
that
we
really
had
no
time
to
read
the
newspaper
there
it
lay
and
nobody
touched
it
for
mr
grey
reads
the
news
in
the
office
always
i
told
mr
grey
it
was
just
paying
so
much
for
no
good
to
anybody
and
i
begged
he
would
countermand
the
paper
but
we
must
take
it
in
again
really
to
know
how
this
fever
goes
on
does
mr
hope
think
my
dears
as
many
people
are
saying
here
this
morning
that
it
is
a
sort
of
plague
oh
mamma
exclaimed
sophia
how
can
you
say
anything
so
dreadful
i
have
not
heard
my
husband
speak
of
it
so
said
hester
he
thinks
it
a
very
serious
affair
happening
as
it
does
in
the
midst
of
a
scarcity
when
the
poor
are
already
depressed
and
sickly
ah
that
is
always
the
way
mr
grey
tells
me
after
a
scarcity
comes
the
fever
he
says
the
poor
are
much
to
be
pitied
indeed
but
what
should
those
do
who
are
not
poor
have
you
heard
mr
hope
say
he
thinks
they
should
help
their
poor
neighbours
to
the
very
utmost
oh
yes
of
course
but
what
i
mean
is
what
precautions
would
be
advise
we
will
ask
him
i
have
not
heard
him
speak
particularly
of
this
on
the
present
occasion
then
he
has
not
established
any
regulations
in
his
own
family
no
but
i
know
his
opinion
on
such
cases
in
general
to
be
that
the
safest
way
is
to
go
on
as
usual
taking
rational
care
of
health
and
avoiding
all
unnecessary
terror
this
common
way
of
living
and
a
particularly
diligent
care
of
those
who
want
the
good
offices
of
the
rich
are
what
he
would
recommend
i
believe
at
this
time
but
when
he
comes
in
we
will
ask
him
you
had
better
stay
till
he
returns
he
may
bring
some
news
meantime
i
am
sorry
my
baby
is
asleep
i
should
like
to
show
you
his
first
tooth
his
first
tooth
indeed
he
is
a
forward
little
fellow
but
hester
do
you
happen
to
have
heard
your
husband
say
what
sort
of
fumigation
he
would
recommend
in
case
of
such
a
fever
as
this
showing
itself
in
the
house
indeed
i
have
not
heard
him
speak
of
fumigations
at
all
have
you
margaret
i
should
just
like
to
know
for
mrs
jones
told
me
of
a
very
good
one
and
mrs
howell
thinks
ill
of
it
mrs
jones
recommended
me
to
pour
some
sulphuric
acid
upon
salt
common
salt
in
a
saucer
but
mrs
howell
says
there
is
nothing
half
so
good
as
hot
vinegar
somebody
has
come
and
put
up
a
stall
said
sophia
where
he
sells
fumigating
powders
and
some
pills
which
he
says
are
an
infallible
remedy
against
the
fever
preventive
my
dear
well
mamma
is
just
the
same
thing
does
mr
hope
know
anything
of
the
people
who
have
set
up
that
stall
hester
thought
she
might
venture
to
answer
that
question
without
waiting
for
her
husband
return
she
laughed
as
she
said
that
medical
men
avoided
acquaintance
with
quacks
does
mr
hope
think
that
medical
men
are
in
any
particular
danger
asked
sophia
bashfully
but
with
great
anxiety
i
think
they
must
be
going
among
so
many
people
who
are
ill
if
there
is
a
whole
family
in
the
fever
in
a
cottage
at
crossly
end
as
mrs
howell
says
there
is
how
very
dangerous
it
must
be
to
attend
them
sophia
was
checked
by
a
wink
from
her
mother
and
then
first
remembered
that
she
was
speaking
to
a
surgeon
wife
she
tried
to
explain
away
what
she
had
said
but
there
was
no
need
hester
calmly
remarked
that
it
was
the
duty
of
many
to
expose
themselves
at
such
times
in
an
equal
degree
with
the
medical
men
and
that
she
believed
that
few
were
more
secure
than
those
who
did
so
without
selfish
thoughts
and
ignorant
panic
sophia
believed
that
every
one
did
not
think
so
some
of
mr
walcot
friends
had
been
remonstrating
with
him
about
going
so
much
among
the
poor
sick
people
just
at
this
time
and
mr
walcot
had
been
consulting
her
as
to
whether
his
duty
to
his
parents
did
not
require
that
he
should
have
some
regard
to
his
own
safety
he
had
not
known
what
to
do
about
going
to
a
house
in
where
some
people
were
a
dead
silence
followed
this
explanation
mrs
grey
broke
it
by
asking
margaret
if
she
might
speak
plainly
to
her
the
common
preface
to
a
lecture
as
usual
margaret
replied
oh
certainly
i
would
only
just
hint
my
dear
that
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
did
not
open
the
door
yourself
you
can
not
think
how
strangely
it
looks
and
some
very
unpleasant
remarks
might
be
made
upon
it
it
is
of
no
consequence
such
a
thing
happening
when
sophia
and
i
come
to
your
door
i
would
not
have
you
think
we
regard
it
for
ourselves
in
the
least
the
not
being
properly
shown
in
by
a
servant
oh
not
in
the
least
protested
sophia
but
you
know
it
might
have
been
the
levitts
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
if
the
levitts
had
called
it
certainly
would
it
might
have
been
the
levitts
certainly
observed
hester
but
i
must
just
explain
that
it
was
to
oblige
me
that
margaret
went
to
the
door
then
my
dear
i
hope
you
will
point
out
some
other
way
in
which
margaret
may
oblige
you
for
really
you
have
no
idea
how
oddly
it
looks
for
young
ladies
to
answer
knocks
at
the
door
it
is
not
proper
proper
regard
to
appearance
and
was
it
to
oblige
you
that
margaret
carried
a
basket
all
through
deerbrook
on
wednesday
with
the
small
end
of
a
carrot
peeping
out
from
under
the
lid
fie
my
dears
i
must
say
fie
it
grieves
me
to
find
fault
with
you
but
really
this
is
folly
it
is
really
neglecting
appearances
too
far
mr
hope
did
not
return
in
time
to
see
mrs
grey
when
she
could
wait
no
longer
hester
promised
to
send
her
husband
to
solve
mrs
difficulties
what
would
she
have
said
exclaimed
hester
if
she
had
seen
my
husband
doings
of
this
morning
ah
what
indeed
actually
shovelling
snow
from
his
own
steps
oh
i
thought
you
meant
giving
away
a
competence
which
act
would
she
have
thought
the
least
she
would
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
on
his
duty
to
his
family
in
both
cases
but
it
is
all
out
of
kindness
that
she
grieves
so
much
over
his
and
lectures
us
for
our
disregard
of
appearances
if
she
loved
us
less
we
should
hear
less
of
her
concern
and
it
would
be
told
to
others
behind
our
backs
so
we
will
not
mind
it
you
do
not
mind
it
margaret
i
rather
enjoy
it
that
is
right
now
i
wish
my
husband
would
come
in
he
has
been
gone
very
long
and
i
want
to
hear
the
whole
truth
about
this
fever
chapter
forty
one
deerbrook
in
shadow
it
was
some
hours
before
hope
appeared
at
home
again
and
when
he
did
he
was
very
grave
mr
walcot
had
been
truly
glad
to
see
him
and
it
was
plain
would
have
applied
to
him
for
aid
and
some
days
before
if
mrs
rowland
had
not
interfered
to
prevent
any
consultation
of
the
kind
the
state
of
health
of
deerbrook
was
bad
much
worse
than
hope
had
had
any
suspicion
of
whole
families
were
prostrated
by
the
fever
in
the
labourers
cottages
and
it
was
creeping
into
the
better
sort
of
houses
mr
walcot
had
requested
hope
to
visit
some
of
his
patients
with
him
and
what
he
had
seen
had
convinced
him
that
the
disease
was
of
a
most
formidable
character
and
that
a
great
mortality
must
be
expected
in
deerbrook
walcot
appeared
to
be
doing
his
duty
with
more
energy
than
might
have
been
expected
and
it
seemed
as
if
whatever
talent
he
had
was
exercised
in
his
profession
hope
opinion
of
him
was
raised
by
what
he
had
seen
this
morning
walcot
had
complained
that
his
skill
and
knowledge
could
have
no
fair
play
among
a
set
of
people
so
ignorant
as
the
families
of
his
deerbrook
patients
they
put
more
faith
in
charms
than
in
medicines
or
care
and
were
running
out
in
the
cold
and
damp
to
have
their
fortunes
told
by
night
or
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
if
a
promised
long
life
all
the
warnings
of
the
doctor
went
for
nothing
then
again
the
people
mistook
the
oppression
which
was
one
of
the
first
symptoms
of
the
fever
for
debility
and
before
the
doctor
was
sent
for
or
in
defiance
of
his
directions
the
patient
was
plied
with
strong
drinks
and
his
case
rendered
desperate
from
the
beginning
mr
walcot
had
complained
that
the
odds
were
really
too
much
against
him
and
that
he
believed
himself
likely
to
lose
almost
every
fever
patient
he
had
it
may
be
imagined
how
welcome
to
him
were
mr
hope
countenance
suggestions
and
influence
such
as
the
prejudices
of
the
people
had
left
it
dr
levitt
influence
was
of
little
more
avail
than
mr
hope
from
this
day
he
was
as
busily
engaged
among
the
sick
as
the
medical
gentlemen
themselves
laying
aside
his
books
and
spending
all
his
time
among
his
parishioners
not
neglecting
the
rich
but
especially
devoting
himself
to
the
poor
he
with
hope
in
every
way
raising
money
to
cleanse
air
and
dry
the
most
cheerless
of
the
cottages
and
to
supply
the
indigent
sick
with
warmth
and
food
but
all
appeared
to
be
of
little
avail
the
disease
stole
on
through
the
village
as
if
it
had
been
left
to
work
its
own
way
from
day
to
day
tidings
came
abroad
of
another
and
another
who
was
down
in
the
fever
the
maidservant
mr
hill
poor
mrs
paxton
always
sure
to
be
ill
when
anybody
else
was
and
all
john
ringworth
five
children
in
a
fortnight
the
church
bell
began
to
give
token
how
fatal
the
sickness
was
becoming
it
tolled
till
those
who
lived
very
near
the
church
were
weary
of
hearing
it
on
the
afternoon
of
a
day
when
its
sound
had
scarcely
ceased
since
sunrise
dr
levitt
and
hope
met
at
the
door
of
the
you
are
the
man
i
wanted
to
meet
said
dr
levitt
i
have
been
inquiring
for
you
but
your
household
could
give
me
no
account
of
you
could
you
just
step
home
with
me
or
come
to
me
in
the
evening
will
you
but
stay
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
after
all
so
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
walk
in
with
you
now
and
if
you
are
going
to
dinner
i
will
make
one
i
have
nobody
to
sit
down
with
me
at
home
at
present
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
not
know
indeed
i
was
not
aware
of
the
absence
of
your
family
said
hope
leading
the
way
into
the
parlour
where
margaret
at
the
moment
was
laying
the
cloth
you
must
have
wondered
that
you
had
seen
nothing
of
my
wife
all
this
week
if
you
did
not
know
where
she
was
i
thought
it
best
all
things
considered
to
send
them
every
one
away
i
hope
we
have
done
right
i
find
i
am
more
free
for
the
discharge
of
my
own
duty
now
that
i
am
unchecked
by
their
fears
for
me
and
untroubled
by
my
own
anxiety
for
them
i
have
sent
them
all
abroad
and
shall
go
for
them
when
this
epidemic
has
run
its
course
and
not
till
then
i
little
thought
what
satisfaction
i
could
feel
in
walking
about
my
own
house
to
see
how
deserted
it
looks
i
never
hear
that
bell
but
i
rejoice
that
all
that
belong
to
me
are
so
far
off
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
that
bell
said
hope
my
question
may
seem
to
you
to
savour
strongly
of
dissent
but
i
must
inquire
whether
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
bad
news
to
be
announced
to
all
deerbrook
every
day
and
almost
all
day
long
however
far
we
may
be
from
objecting
to
hear
it
in
ordinary
times
should
not
our
first
consideration
now
be
for
the
living
is
not
the
case
altered
by
the
number
of
deaths
that
takes
place
at
a
season
like
this
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
mr
hope
and
i
have
talked
with
owen
and
many
others
about
that
matter
within
this
week
i
have
proposed
to
dispense
for
the
present
with
a
custom
which
i
own
myself
to
be
attached
to
in
ordinary
times
but
which
i
now
see
may
be
pernicious
but
it
can
not
be
done
we
must
yield
the
point
i
will
not
engage
to
cure
any
sick
or
to
keep
any
well
who
live
within
sound
of
that
bell
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
but
this
practice
has
so
become
a
part
of
people
religion
that
it
seems
as
if
worse
effects
would
follow
from
discontinuing
it
than
from
pursuing
the
usual
course
owen
says
there
is
scarcely
a
person
in
deerbrook
who
would
not
talk
of
a
heathen
death
and
burial
if
the
bell
were
silenced
and
if
once
the
people
repose
in
their
religion
is
shaken
i
really
know
not
what
will
become
of
them
i
agree
with
you
there
their
religious
feelings
must
be
left
untouched
or
all
is
over
but
i
am
sorry
that
this
particular
observance
is
implicated
with
them
so
completely
as
you
say
it
will
be
well
if
it
does
not
soon
become
an
impossibility
to
toll
the
bell
for
all
who
die
it
would
be
well
too
said
dr
levitt
if
this
were
the
only
superstition
the
people
entertained
they
are
more
terrified
with
some
others
than
with
this
bell
i
am
afraid
they
are
more
depressed
by
their
superstitions
than
sustained
by
their
religion
have
you
observed
hope
how
many
of
them
stand
looking
at
the
sky
every
night
yes
and
we
hear
wherever
we
go
of
fiery
swords
and
dreadful
angels
seen
in
the
clouds
and
the
old
prophecies
have
all
come
up
again
at
least
all
of
them
that
are
dismal
as
for
the
they
are
out
of
number
and
there
is
never
a
fire
lighted
but
a
coffin
flies
out
and
this
story
of
a
ghost
of
a
coffin
with
four
ghosts
to
bear
it
that
goes
up
and
down
in
the
village
all
night
long
said
hester
i
really
do
not
wonder
that
it
shakes
the
nerves
of
the
sick
to
hear
of
it
they
say
that
no
one
can
stop
those
bearers
or
get
any
answer
from
them
but
on
they
glide
let
what
will
be
in
their
way
come
tell
me
said
dr
levitt
have
not
you
yourself
looked
out
for
that
sight
hester
acknowledged
that
she
had
seen
a
real
substantial
coffin
carried
by
human
bearers
pass
down
the
middle
of
the
street
at
an
hour
past
midnight
the
removal
of
a
body
from
a
house
where
it
had
died
she
supposed
to
another
whence
it
was
to
be
buried
this
coffin
and
the
ghostly
one
she
took
to
be
one
and
the
same
dr
levitt
mentioned
instances
of
superstition
which
could
scarcely
have
been
believed
by
him
if
related
by
another
do
you
know
the
platts
he
inquired
of
hope
have
you
seen
the
poor
woman
that
lies
ill
there
with
her
child
yes
what
a
state
of
destitution
they
are
in
at
the
very
time
that
that
woman
and
her
child
are
lying
on
shavings
begged
from
the
carpenter
yard
her
mother
finds
means
to
fee
the
in
the
lane
for
reading
a
dream
the
dooms
the
child
and
speaks
doubtfully
of
the
mother
i
could
not
conceive
the
reason
why
no
one
of
the
family
would
do
anything
for
the
boy
i
used
what
authority
i
could
while
i
was
there
but
i
fear
he
has
been
left
to
his
fate
since
the
neighbours
will
not
enter
the
house
what
neighbours
said
margaret
you
have
never
so
much
as
asked
me
you
are
our
main
stay
at
home
margaret
i
could
ask
no
more
of
you
than
you
do
here
margaret
was
now
putting
the
dinner
on
the
table
it
consisted
of
a
bowl
of
potatoes
salt
the
loaf
and
butter
and
a
pitcher
of
water
dr
levitt
said
grace
and
they
sat
down
without
one
word
of
apology
from
host
or
hostess
though
dr
levitt
had
not
been
prepared
for
an
evidence
like
this
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
family
he
had
known
enough
of
their
adversity
to
understand
the
case
now
at
a
glance
no
one
ate
more
heartily
than
he
and
the
conversation
went
on
as
if
a
sumptuous
feast
had
been
spread
before
the
party
i
own
myself
disappointed
said
hope
in
finding
among
our
neighbours
so
little
disposition
to
help
each
other
i
hardly
understand
it
trusting
as
i
have
ever
done
in
the
generosity
of
the
poor
and
having
always
before
seen
my
faith
justified
the
apathy
of
some
and
the
selfish
terrors
of
others
are
worse
to
witness
than
the
disease
itself
how
can
you
wonder
said
dr
levitt
when
they
have
such
an
example
before
their
eyes
in
certain
of
their
neighbours
to
whom
they
are
accustomed
to
look
up
sir
william
hunter
and
his
lady
are
enough
to
paralyse
the
morals
of
the
whole
parish
at
a
time
like
this
do
not
you
know
the
plan
they
go
upon
they
keep
their
outer
gates
locked
lest
any
one
from
the
village
should
set
foot
within
their
grounds
every
article
left
at
the
lodge
for
the
use
of
the
family
is
fumigated
before
it
is
admitted
into
the
house
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
neither
the
gentleman
nor
the
lady
will
leave
the
estate
in
any
emergency
whatever
till
the
disease
has
entirely
passed
away
our
poor
are
not
to
have
the
solace
of
their
presence
even
in
church
during
this
time
of
peril
when
the
face
of
the
prosperous
is
like
light
in
a
dark
place
sir
william
makes
it
no
secret
that
they
would
have
left
home
altogether
if
they
could
have
hoped
to
be
safer
anywhere
else
if
they
could
have
gone
anywhere
without
danger
of
meeting
the
fever
if
the
fact
had
not
been
said
hester
as
mrs
howell
states
it
that
the
epidemic
prevails
partially
everywhere
there
is
a
case
where
lady
hunter
example
immediately
operates
observed
dr
levitt
if
lady
hunter
had
not
forgotten
herself
in
her
duty
mrs
howell
would
have
given
the
benefit
of
her
good
offices
to
some
whom
she
might
have
served
for
she
is
really
a
woman
but
she
is
struck
with
a
panic
because
lady
hunter
is
and
one
can
not
get
a
word
with
her
or
miss
miskin
i
saw
that
her
shutters
were
nearly
closed
observed
margaret
i
supposed
she
had
lost
some
relation
no
she
is
only
trying
to
shut
out
the
fever
she
and
miss
miskin
are
afraid
of
the
milkman
and
each
tries
to
put
upon
the
other
the
peril
of
serving
a
customer
this
panic
will
destroy
us
if
it
spreads
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
and
in
one
glance
exchanged
agreement
that
the
time
was
fully
come
for
them
to
act
abroad
let
what
would
become
of
their
home
comforts
i
ought
to
add
however
said
dr
levitt
that
sir
william
hunter
has
supplied
my
poor
purse
with
money
very
liberally
i
spend
his
money
as
freely
as
my
own
at
a
time
like
this
but
i
tell
him
that
one
hour
of
his
presence
among
us
would
do
more
good
than
all
the
gold
he
can
send
his
answer
comes
in
the
shape
of
a
handsome
draft
on
his
banker
smelling
strongly
of
aromatic
vinegar
they
fumigate
even
their
it
seems
to
me
i
did
hope
my
last
letter
would
have
brought
him
to
call
our
friends
are
very
ready
with
their
money
said
hope
i
should
have
begged
of
you
before
this
but
that
mr
grey
has
been
liberal
in
that
way
he
concludes
it
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
look
himself
into
the
wants
of
the
village
but
he
permits
me
to
use
his
purse
pretty
freely
is
there
anything
that
you
can
suggest
that
can
be
done
by
me
dr
levitt
is
there
any
case
unknown
to
me
where
i
can
be
of
service
or
i
said
margaret
my
brother
and
sister
will
spare
me
and
put
up
with
some
hardship
at
home
i
know
if
you
can
point
out
any
place
where
i
can
be
more
useful
to
be
sure
i
can
much
as
i
like
to
come
to
your
house
to
witness
and
feel
the
thorough
comfort
which
i
always
find
in
it
i
own
i
shall
care
little
to
see
everything
at
sixes
and
sevens
here
for
a
few
weeks
if
you
will
give
me
your
time
and
talents
for
such
services
as
we
gentlemen
can
not
perform
and
as
we
can
not
at
present
hire
persons
to
undertake
you
see
i
take
you
at
your
word
my
dear
young
lady
if
you
had
not
offered
i
should
not
have
asked
you
as
you
have
i
snatch
at
the
good
you
hold
out
i
mean
to
preach
a
very
plain
sermon
next
sunday
on
the
duties
of
neighbours
in
a
season
of
distress
like
this
and
i
shall
do
it
with
the
better
hope
if
i
have
meanwhile
a
of
your
sex
no
less
valuable
in
her
way
than
my
friend
hope
in
his
i
shall
come
and
hear
your
sermon
said
hester
if
margaret
will
take
charge
of
my
boy
for
the
hour
i
want
to
see
clearly
what
is
my
duty
at
a
time
when
claims
conflict
as
they
do
now
there
was
at
present
no
time
for
the
conscientious
and
charitable
to
lose
in
daylight
loiterings
over
the
table
or
chat
by
the
fireside
in
a
few
minutes
the
table
was
cleared
and
margaret
ready
to
proceed
with
dr
levitt
to
the
platts
cottage
as
soon
as
margaret
saw
what
was
the
real
state
of
affairs
in
the
cottage
she
sent
away
dr
levitt
who
could
be
of
no
use
till
some
degree
of
decency
was
instituted
in
the
miserable
abode
what
to
set
about
first
was
margaret
difficulty
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
but
mrs
platt
mother
who
was
sitting
down
to
wait
the
result
of
the
predictions
her
daughter
lay
moaning
on
a
bedstead
spread
with
shavings
only
and
she
had
no
covering
whatever
but
a
blanket
worn
into
a
large
hole
in
the
middle
the
poor
woman
long
hair
unconfined
by
any
cap
strayed
about
her
bare
and
emaciated
shoulders
and
her
shrunken
bands
picked
at
the
blanket
incessantly
everything
appearing
to
her
diseased
vision
covered
with
black
spots
never
before
had
so
squalid
an
object
met
margaret
eyes
the
husband
sat
by
the
empty
grate
stooping
and
shrinking
and
looking
at
the
floor
with
an
idiotic
expression
of
countenance
as
appeared
through
the
handkerchief
which
was
tied
over
his
head
he
was
just
sinking
into
the
fever
his
boy
lay
on
a
heap
of
rags
in
the
corner
his
head
also
tied
up
but
the
handkerchief
stiff
with
the
black
blood
which
was
still
oozing
from
his
nose
ears
and
mouth
it
was
inconceivable
to
margaret
that
her
brother
with
mr
grey
money
in
his
pocket
could
have
left
the
family
in
this
state
he
had
not
there
were
cinders
in
the
hearth
which
showed
that
there
had
been
a
fire
and
the
old
woman
acknowledged
that
a
pair
of
sheets
and
a
rug
had
been
pawned
to
the
in
the
lane
since
the
morning
there
had
been
food
but
nobody
had
any
appetite
but
herself
and
she
had
eaten
it
up
the
had
charmed
the
pail
of
fresh
water
that
stood
under
the
bed
and
had
promised
a
new
spell
in
the
morning
in
a
case
of
such
extremity
margaret
had
no
fears
she
set
forth
alone
for
the
not
far
off
and
redeemed
the
sheets
and
blanket
which
were
quite
clean
as
she
went
she
was
sorry
she
had
dismissed
dr
levitt
so
soon
as
a
magistrate
he
could
have
immediately
compelled
the
restoration
of
the
bedding
the
use
of
his
name
however
answered
the
purpose
and
the
conjurer
even
offered
to
carry
the
articles
for
her
to
platt
house
she
so
earnestly
desired
to
keep
him
and
her
charge
apart
that
she
preferred
loading
herself
with
the
package
then
the
shavings
were
found
to
be
in
such
a
state
that
every
shred
of
them
must
be
removed
before
the
sick
man
could
be
allowed
to
lie
down
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
the
face
of
the
old
woman
protestations
that
her
daughter
should
not
stir
margaret
spread
the
bedding
on
the
floor
wrapped
the
sick
woman
in
a
sheet
and
laid
her
upon
it
finding
the
poor
creature
so
light
from
emaciation
that
she
was
as
easy
to
lift
as
a
child
the
only
thing
that
the
old
woman
would
consent
to
do
was
to
go
with
a
pencil
note
to
mr
grey
and
bring
back
the
clean
dry
straw
which
would
be
given
her
in
his
yard
she
went
in
hopes
of
receiving
something
else
with
the
straw
and
while
she
was
gone
margaret
was
quite
alone
with
the
sick
family
struggling
to
surmount
her
disgust
at
the
task
she
resolved
to
employ
the
interval
in
removing
the
shavings
the
pail
containing
the
charmed
water
was
the
only
thing
in
the
cottage
which
would
hold
them
and
she
made
bold
to
empty
it
in
the
ditch
close
at
hand
platt
was
capable
of
watching
all
she
did
and
he
made
a
frightful
gesture
of
rage
at
her
as
she
she
saw
in
the
shadow
of
the
handkerchief
his
quivering
lips
move
in
the
act
of
speaking
and
her
ear
caught
the
words
of
an
oath
her
situation
now
was
far
from
pleasant
but
it
was
still
a
relief
that
no
one
was
by
to
witness
what
she
saw
and
was
doing
she
conveyed
pailful
after
pailful
of
the
noisome
shavings
to
the
dunghill
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
wondering
the
while
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
dwelling
were
not
all
dead
of
the
fever
long
ago
she
almost
gave
over
her
task
when
a
huge
toad
crawled
upon
her
foot
from
its
among
the
shavings
she
shrunk
from
it
and
was
glad
to
see
it
make
for
the
door
of
its
own
accord
platt
again
growled
and
clenched
his
fist
at
her
he
probably
thought
that
she
had
again
broken
a
charm
for
which
he
had
paid
money
she
spoke
kindly
and
cheerfully
again
and
again
but
he
was
either
deaf
or
too
ill
to
understand
to
relieve
the
sense
of
dreariness
she
went
to
work
again
she
thoroughly
cleansed
the
pail
and
filled
it
afresh
from
the
brook
looking
anxiously
down
the
lane
for
the
approach
of
some
human
creature
and
then
applied
herself
to
rubbing
the
bedstead
as
dry
and
clean
as
she
could
with
an
apron
of
the
old
woman
in
due
time
her
messenger
returned
and
with
her
ben
carrying
a
truss
of
straw
his
face
was
the
face
of
a
friend
we
must
have
some
warm
water
ben
to
clean
these
poor
creatures
and
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
make
a
fire
with
and
it
would
take
a
long
time
miss
to
get
the
coals
and
heat
the
water
and
the
poor
soul
lying
there
all
the
time
could
not
i
bring
you
a
pail
of
hot
water
from
the
quicker
than
that
do
and
soap
and
towels
from
home
ben
was
gone
with
the
pail
during
the
whole
time
of
spreading
the
straw
on
the
bedstead
the
old
woman
remonstrated
against
anything
being
done
to
her
daughter
beyond
laying
her
where
she
was
before
and
giving
her
a
little
warm
spirits
but
when
she
discovered
that
the
charmed
water
had
been
thrown
out
into
the
ditch
all
to
her
seemed
over
her
last
hope
was
gone
and
she
sat
down
in
sulky
silence
eyeing
proceedings
without
any
offer
to
help
when
the
warm
water
arrived
and
the
sick
woman
seemed
to
like
the
sponging
and
drying
of
her
fevered
limbs
the
mother
began
to
relent
and
at
last
approached
to
give
her
assistance
holding
her
poor
daughter
in
her
arms
while
margaret
spread
the
blanket
and
sheet
on
the
straw
and
then
lifting
the
patient
into
the
now
clean
bed
she
was
still
unwilling
to
waste
any
time
and
trouble
on
the
child
in
the
corner
but
margaret
was
peremptory
she
saw
that
he
was
dying
but
not
the
less
for
this
must
he
be
made
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
permit
in
half
an
hour
he
too
was
laid
on
his
bed
of
clean
straw
and
the
filthy
rags
with
which
he
had
been
surrounded
were
deposited
out
of
doors
till
some
one
who
would
wash
them
could
come
for
them
by
a
promise
of
fire
and
food
margaret
bribed
the
old
woman
to
let
things
remain
as
they
were
while
she
went
for
her
brother
whose
skill
and
care
she
hoped
might
now
have
some
chance
of
saving
his
patients
she
recommended
that
platt
himself
should
not
attempt
to
sit
up
any
longer
and
engaged
to
return
in
half
an
hour
she
paused
on
the
threshold
a
minute
to
see
how
far
platt
was
able
to
walk
so
great
seemed
to
be
the
difficulty
with
which
he
raised
himself
from
his
chair
with
the
old
woman
assistance
once
he
stumbled
and
would
have
fallen
if
margaret
had
not
sprung
to
his
side
on
recovering
himself
he
wrenched
his
arm
from
her
and
pushed
her
backwards
with
more
force
than
she
had
supposed
he
possessed
there
was
a
on
the
old
woman
face
as
he
did
this
which
made
margaret
shudder
but
she
was
more
troubled
by
a
look
from
the
man
which
she
caught
from
beneath
the
handkerchief
that
bound
his
head
a
look
which
she
could
not
but
fancy
she
had
met
before
with
the
same
feeling
of
uneasiness
when
she
had
seen
him
safely
seated
on
the
bedside
she
hastened
away
for
her
brother
they
lost
no
more
time
in
returning
than
just
to
step
to
widow
rye
to
ask
whether
she
would
sit
up
with
this
miserable
family
this
night
the
widow
would
have
done
anything
else
in
the
world
for
mr
hope
and
she
did
not
positively
refuse
to
do
this
but
the
fear
of
her
neighbours
had
so
infected
her
and
her
terror
of
a
was
so
extreme
that
it
was
evident
her
presence
there
would
do
more
harm
than
good
she
was
glad
to
compound
for
a
less
hazardous
service
and
agreed
to
wash
for
the
sick
with
all
diligence
if
she
was
not
required
to
enter
the
houses
but
might
fetch
the
linen
from
tubs
of
water
placed
outside
the
doors
after
setting
on
plenty
of
water
to
heat
she
now
followed
hope
and
margaret
to
the
cottage
in
the
lane
it
was
nearly
dark
and
they
walked
rapidly
margaret
describing
as
they
went
what
she
had
done
and
what
she
thought
remained
to
be
done
to
give
mrs
platt
a
chance
of
recovery
what
now
why
do
you
start
so
cried
hope
as
she
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
margaret
even
stood
still
for
one
moment
hope
looked
the
way
she
was
looking
and
saw
in
the
little
twilight
that
remained
the
figure
of
some
one
who
had
been
walking
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
but
whose
walk
was
now
quickened
to
a
run
it
is
it
is
he
said
hope
as
philip
disappeared
in
the
darkness
answering
to
what
he
knew
must
be
in
margaret
thoughts
he
continued
he
knows
the
state
the
village
is
in
the
danger
that
we
are
all
in
and
he
can
not
stay
away
when
i
say
i
mean
you
particularly
if
you
think
so
murmured
margaret
and
stopped
for
breath
i
think
so
but
it
does
not
follow
that
there
is
any
change
he
has
always
loved
you
margaret
do
not
deceive
yourself
do
not
afflict
yourself
with
expectations
do
not
speak
to
me
brother
i
can
not
bear
a
word
from
you
about
him
hope
sighed
deeply
but
he
could
not
remonstrate
he
knew
that
margaret
had
only
too
much
reason
for
saying
this
they
walked
on
in
entire
silence
to
the
lane
a
fire
was
now
kindled
and
a
light
dimly
burned
in
platt
cottage
as
margaret
stood
by
the
bedside
watching
her
brother
examination
of
his
patient
and
anxious
to
understand
rightly
the
directions
he
was
giving
the
poor
woman
half
raised
her
head
from
her
pillow
and
fixed
her
dull
eyes
on
margaret
face
saying
as
if
thinking
aloud
the
lady
has
heard
some
good
news
sure
she
looks
the
mother
herself
turned
round
to
stare
and
for
the
first
time
dropped
a
curtsey
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
look
cheerful
too
one
day
soon
if
we
nurse
you
well
said
margaret
then
miss
do
let
them
move
me
to
take
the
blankets
away
again
you
shall
not
be
moved
unless
you
wish
it
i
am
going
to
stay
with
you
her
brother
did
not
oppose
this
for
he
did
not
know
of
the
unpleasant
glances
and
mutterings
with
which
platt
rewarded
all
margaret
good
offices
hope
believed
he
should
himself
be
out
all
night
among
his
patients
he
would
come
early
in
the
morning
and
now
fairly
warned
margaret
that
it
was
very
possible
that
the
child
might
die
in
the
course
of
the
night
she
was
not
deterred
by
this
nor
by
her
dread
of
the
sick
man
she
had
gained
a
new
strength
of
soul
and
this
night
she
feared
nothing
during
the
long
hours
there
was
much
to
do
three
sufferers
at
once
requiring
her
cares
and
amidst
all
that
she
did
she
was
sustained
by
the
thought
that
she
had
seen
philip
and
that
he
was
near
the
abyss
of
nothingness
was
passed
and
she
now
trod
the
ground
of
certainty
of
his
existence
and
of
his
remembrance
when
her
brother
entered
letting
in
the
first
grey
of
the
morning
as
he
opened
the
cottage
door
he
found
her
almost
untired
almost
gay
platt
was
worse
his
wife
much
the
same
and
the
child
still
living
the
old
heart
was
so
far
touched
with
the
unwonted
comfort
of
the
past
night
and
with
her
having
been
allowed
and
even
encouraged
to
take
her
rest
that
she
now
offered
her
bundle
of
clothes
for
the
lady
to
lie
down
upon
and
when
that
favour
was
declined
readily
promised
not
to
part
with
any
article
to
the
till
she
should
see
some
of
mr
hope
family
again
hope
thought
mrs
platt
might
possibly
get
through
and
this
was
all
that
was
said
on
the
way
home
margaret
lay
down
to
rest
to
sweet
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
when
she
appeared
below
her
brother
and
sister
had
half
done
breakfast
and
mr
grey
and
his
twin
daughters
were
with
them
mr
grey
came
to
say
that
he
and
all
his
family
were
to
leave
deerbrook
in
two
hours
where
they
should
settle
for
the
present
they
had
not
yet
made
up
their
minds
the
first
object
was
to
get
away
the
epidemic
being
now
really
too
frightful
to
be
encountered
any
longer
they
should
proceed
immediately
to
brighton
and
there
determine
whether
to
go
to
the
continent
or
seek
some
healthy
place
nearer
home
to
stay
in
till
deerbrook
should
again
be
habitable
they
were
extremely
anxious
to
carry
hester
margaret
and
the
baby
with
them
they
knew
mr
hope
could
not
desert
his
posts
but
they
thought
he
would
feel
as
dr
levitt
did
far
happier
to
know
that
his
family
were
out
of
danger
than
to
have
them
with
him
hester
had
firmly
refused
to
go
from
the
first
mention
of
the
plan
and
now
margaret
was
equally
decided
in
expressing
her
determination
to
stay
mr
grey
urged
the
extreme
danger
fanny
and
mary
hung
about
her
and
implored
her
to
go
and
to
carry
the
baby
with
her
they
should
so
like
to
have
the
baby
with
them
for
a
great
many
weeks
and
they
would
take
care
of
him
and
play
with
him
all
day
long
their
father
once
more
interposed
for
the
child
sake
hester
might
go
to
brighton
there
wean
her
infant
and
return
to
her
husband
so
that
the
little
helpless
creature
might
at
least
be
safe
mr
grey
would
not
conceal
that
he
considered
this
a
positive
duty
that
the
parents
would
have
much
to
answer
for
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
boy
at
home
the
parents
hearts
swelled
they
looked
at
each
other
and
felt
that
this
was
not
a
moment
in
which
to
perplex
themselves
with
calculations
of
incalculable
things
with
comparisons
of
the
dangers
which
threatened
their
infant
abroad
and
at
home
this
was
a
decision
for
their
hearts
to
make
their
hearts
decided
that
their
child
right
place
was
in
his
parents
arms
and
that
their
best
hope
now
as
at
all
other
times
was
to
live
and
die
together
hester
had
heard
from
her
husband
of
the
apparition
of
the
preceding
evening
and
she
therefore
knew
that
there
was
less
of
as
mr
grey
called
what
some
others
would
have
named
virtue
in
determination
to
stay
than
might
appear
if
philip
was
here
how
vain
must
be
all
attempts
to
remove
her
mr
grey
might
as
well
set
about
persuading
the
old
church
tower
to
go
with
him
and
so
he
found
oh
cousin
margaret
said
mary
in
a
whisper
with
a
face
of
much
sorrow
mamma
will
not
ask
miss
young
to
go
with
us
if
she
should
be
ill
while
we
are
gone
if
she
should
die
nonsense
mary
cried
fanny
partly
overhearing
and
partly
guessing
what
her
sister
had
said
you
know
mamma
says
it
is
not
convenient
and
miss
young
is
not
like
my
cousins
as
mamma
says
a
member
of
a
family
with
people
depending
upon
her
it
is
quite
a
different
case
mary
as
you
must
know
very
well
only
think
cousin
margaret
what
an
odd
thing
it
will
be
to
be
so
many
weeks
without
saying
any
lessons
how
we
shall
enjoy
ourselves
but
if
miss
young
should
be
ill
and
die
persisted
mary
pooh
why
should
she
be
ill
and
die
more
than
dr
levitt
and
ben
and
our
cook
and
my
cousins
and
all
that
are
going
to
stay
behind
margaret
i
do
wish
cousin
hester
would
let
us
carry
the
baby
with
us
we
shall
have
no
lessons
to
do
you
know
and
we
could
play
with
him
all
day
long
yes
i
wish
he
might
go
said
mary
but
margaret
do
you
not
think
if
you
spoke
a
word
to
papa
and
mamma
they
would
let
me
stay
with
miss
young
i
know
she
would
make
room
for
me
for
she
did
for
phoebe
when
phoebe
nursed
her
and
i

mamma

kiss

baby

more
i
ca
think
why
you
wo
let
him
go
with
us
we
should
like
so
to
have
him
so
do
we
said
hester
laughing
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
greys
the
three
looked
in
each
faces
that
glance
assured
each
other
that
they
had
done
right
in
that
glance
was
a
mutual
promise
of
cheerful
fidelity
through
whatever
might
be
impending
there
was
no
sadness
in
the
tone
of
their
conversation
and
when
within
two
hours
the
greys
went
by
driven
slowly
because
there
was
a
funeral
train
on
each
side
of
the
way
there
was
full
as
much
happiness
in
the
faces
that
smiled
a
farewell
from
the
windows
as
in
the
gestures
of
the
young
people
who
started
up
in
the
carriage
to
kiss
their
hands
and
who
were
being
borne
away
from
the
abode
of
danger
and
death
to
spend
several
weeks
without
doing
any
lessons
often
during
this
day
was
the
voice
of
mirth
even
heard
in
this
dwelling
it
was
not
like
the
mirth
of
the
company
of
prisoners
in
the
first
french
revolution
men
who
knew
that
they
should
leave
their
prison
only
to
lose
their
heads
and
who
once
mutually
acknowledging
this
agreed
vainly
and
pusillanimously
to
banish
from
that
hour
all
sad
all
grave
thoughts
and
laugh
till
they
died
it
was
not
this
mirth
of
despair
nor
yet
that
of
carelessness
nor
yet
that
of
defiance
nor
were
theirs
the
spirits
of
the
patriot
in
the
hour
of
struggle
nor
of
the
hero
in
the
crisis
of
danger
in
a
peril
like
theirs
there
is
nothing
imposing
to
the
imagination
or
flattering
to
the
pride
or
immediately
appealing
to
the
energies
of
the
soul
there
were
no
resources
for
them
in
emotions
of
valour
or
patriotism
theirs
was
the
gaiety
of
simple
faith
and
innocence
they
had
acted
from
pure
inclination
from
affection
unconscious
of
pride
of
difficulty
of
merit
and
they
were
satisfied
and
gay
as
the
innocent
ought
to
be
enjoying
what
there
was
to
enjoy
and
questioning
and
fearing
nothing
beyond
from
a
distant
point
of
time
or
place
such
a
state
of
spirits
in
the
midst
of
a
pestilence
may
appear
unnatural
and
wrong
but
experience
proves
that
it
is
neither
whatever
observers
may
think
it
is
natural
and
it
is
right
that
minds
strong
enough
to
be
settled
either
in
a
good
or
evil
frame
should
preserve
their
usual
character
amidst
any
changes
of
circumstance
to
those
involved
in
new
events
they
appear
less
strange
than
in
prospect
or
in
review
habitual
thoughts
are
present
familiarising
wonderful
incidents
and
the
fears
of
the
selfish
the
repose
of
the
religious
the
speculations
of
the
thoughtful
and
the
gaiety
of
the
innocent
pervade
the
life
of
each
let
what
will
be
happening
yet
to
the
prevailing
mood
the
circumstances
of
the
time
will
interpose
an
occasional
check
this
very
evening
when
margaret
was
absent
at
the
cottage
in
the
lane
and
hope
wearied
with
his
toils
among
the
sick
all
the
night
and
all
this
day
was
apparently
sleeping
for
an
hour
on
the
sofa
hester
heart
grew
heavy
as
she
lulled
her
infant
to
rest
by
the
fire
as
she
thought
on
what
was
passing
in
the
houses
of
her
neighbours
death
seemed
to
close
around
the
little
being
she
held
in
her
arms
as
she
gazed
in
his
face
watching
the
slumber
stealing
on
she
murmured
over
him
oh
my
child
my
child
if
i
should
lose
you
what
i
do
hester
my
love
said
her
husband
in
a
tone
of
tender
remonstrance
what
you
mean
i
did
not
think
you
would
hear
me
love
but
i
thank
you
what
did
i
mean
not
exactly
what
i
said
for
god
knows
i
would
strive
to
part
willingly
with
whatever
he
might
see
fit
to
take
away
but
oh
edward
what
a
struggle
it
would
be
and
how
near
it
comes
to
us
how
many
mothers
are
now
parting
from
their
children
god
will
be
done
cried
hope
starting
up
and
standing
over
his
babe
are
you
sure
edward
may
we
feel
quite
certain
that
we
have
done
rightly
by
our
boy
in
keeping
him
here
i
am
satisfied
my
love
then
i
am
prepared
how
still
he
is
now
how
like
death
it
looks
what
that
warm
breathing
sleep
no
more
like
death
than
his
laugh
is
like
sin
and
hope
looked
about
him
for
pencil
and
paper
and
hastily
sketched
his
boy
in
all
the
beauty
of
repose
before
he
went
forth
again
among
the
sick
and
wretched
it
was
very
like
and
hester
placed
it
before
her
as
she
plied
her
needle
all
that
long
solitary
evening
chapter
forty
two
hester
went
to
church
the
next
sunday
as
she
wished
to
hear
dr
levitt
promised
plain
sermon
on
the
duties
of
the
times
margaret
gladly
staid
at
home
with
the
baby
thankful
for
the
relief
from
the
sight
of
sickness
and
for
the
quiet
of
solitude
while
the
infant
slept
edward
was
busy
among
those
who
wanted
his
good
offices
as
he
now
was
almost
without
intermission
hester
had
to
go
alone
everything
abroad
looked
very
strange
quite
unlike
the
common
sunday
aspect
of
the
place
the
streets
were
empty
except
that
a
party
of
mourners
were
returning
from
a
funeral
either
people
were
already
all
in
church
or
nobody
was
going
she
quickened
her
pace
in
the
fear
that
she
might
be
late
though
the
bell
seemed
to
assure
her
that
she
was
not
widow
rye
little
was
all
covered
with
linen
put
out
to
dry
and
mrs
rye
might
be
seen
through
the
window
at
the
the
want
of
fresh
linen
was
so
pressing
that
the
sick
must
not
be
kept
waiting
though
it
was
sunday
miss
nares
and
miss
flint
were
in
plying
their
needles
they
had
been
up
all
night
and
were
now
putting
the
last
stitches
to
a
suit
of
family
mourning
which
was
to
enable
the
bereaved
to
attend
afternoon
church
miss
nares
looked
quite
haggard
as
she
well
might
having
scarcely
left
her
seat
for
the
last
fortnight
except
to
take
orders
for
mourning
and
to
snatch
a
scanty
portion
of
rest
she
had
endeavoured
to
procure
an
additional
or
two
from
among
her
neighbours
and
then
from
blickley
but
her
neighbours
were
busy
with
their
domestic
troubles
and
the
blickley
people
wanted
more
mourning
than
the
hands
there
could
supply
so
miss
nares
and
miss
flint
had
been
compelled
to
work
night
and
day
till
they
both
looked
as
if
they
had
had
the
sickness
and
were
justified
in
saying
that
no
money
could
pay
them
for
what
they
were
undergoing
they
began
earnestly
to
wish
what
they
had
till
now
deprecated
that
dr
levitt
might
succeed
in
inducing
some
of
his
flock
to
forego
the
practice
of
wearing
mourning
but
of
this
there
was
little
prospect
the
people
were
as
determined
upon
wearing
black
as
upon
having
the
bell
tolled
for
the
dead
and
miss
nares
heart
sank
at
the
prospect
before
her
if
the
epidemic
should
continue
and
she
should
be
able
to
get
no
help
almost
every
second
house
in
the
place
was
shut
up
the
blank
windows
of
the
cottages
where
plants
or
smiling
faces
were
usually
to
be
seen
on
a
sunday
morning
looked
dreary
the
inhabitants
of
many
of
the
better
dwellings
were
absent
there
were
no
voices
of
children
about
the
little
courts
no
groups
of
boys
under
the
churchyard
wall
of
those
who
had
frequented
this
spot
several
were
under
the
sod
some
were
laid
low
in
fever
within
the
houses
and
others
were
with
their
parents
forming
a
larger
congregation
round
the
tents
in
the
lanes
than
dr
levitt
could
assemble
in
the
church
hester
heard
the
strokes
of
the
hammer
and
the
saw
as
she
passed
the
closed
shop
of
the
carpenter
who
was
also
the
undertaker
she
knew
that
people
were
making
coffins
by
candlelight
within
happening
to
look
round
after
she
had
passed
she
saw
a
woman
come
out
wan
in
countenance
and
carrying
under
her
cloak
something
which
a
puff
of
wind
showed
to
be
an
infant
coffin
a
sight
from
which
every
young
mother
averts
her
eyes
as
hester
approached
a
cottage
whose
thatch
had
not
been
weeded
for
long
she
was
startled
by
a
howl
and
whine
from
within
and
a
dog
emaciated
to
the
last
degree
sprang
upon
the
sill
of
an
open
window
a
neighbour
who
perceived
her
shrink
back
and
hesitate
to
pass
assured
her
that
she
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
dog
the
poor
animal
would
not
leave
the
place
whose
inmates
were
all
dead
of
the
fever
the
window
was
left
open
for
the
dog
escape
but
he
never
came
out
though
he
looked
famished
some
persons
had
thrown
in
food
at
first
but
now
no
one
had
time
or
thought
to
spare
for
dogs
mr
walcot
issued
from
a
house
near
the
church
as
hester
passed
and
he
stopped
her
he
was
roused
or
frightened
out
of
his
usual
simplicity
of
manner
and
observed
with
an
air
of
deep
anxiety
that
he
trusted
mr
hope
had
better
success
with
his
patients
than
he
could
boast
of
the
disease
was
most
terrific
and
the
saving
of
a
life
was
a
chance
now
seemingly
too
rare
to
be
reckoned
on
it
really
required
more
strength
than
most
men
had
to
stand
by
their
duty
at
such
a
time
when
they
could
do
little
more
than
see
their
patients
die
hester
thought
him
so
much
moved
that
he
was
at
this
moment
hardly
fit
for
business
she
said
we
all
have
need
of
all
our
strength
i
do
not
know
whether
worship
gives
it
to
you
as
it
does
to
me
will
it
not
be
an
hour
or
even
half
an
hour
well
spent
if
you
go
with
me
there
pointing
to
the
church
you
will
say
you
are
wanted
elsewhere
but
will
you
not
be
stronger
and
calmer
for
the
comfort
you
may
find
there
i
should
like
it
i
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
going
to
church
it
would
do
me
good
i
know
but
mrs
hope
how
is
this
i
thought
you
had
been
a
dissenter
i
always
said
so
i
have
been
very
wrong
very
i
am
a
dissenter
said
hester
smiling
but
you
are
not
and
therefore
i
may
urge
you
to
go
to
church
as
for
the
rest
of
the
mystery
i
will
explain
it
when
we
have
more
time
meanwhile
i
hope
you
do
not
suppose
that
dissenters
do
not
worship
and
need
and
love
worship
as
other
people
do
mr
walcot
replied
by
timidly
offering
his
arm
which
hester
accepted
and
they
entered
the
church
together
the
rowlands
were
already
in
their
pew
there
was
a
general
commotion
among
the
children
when
they
saw
mrs
hope
and
mr
walcot
walking
up
the
aisle
matilda
called
her
mother
attention
to
the
remarkable
fact
and
the
little
heads
all
whispered
together
the
church
looked
really
almost
empty
there
were
no
hunters
with
their
train
of
servants
there
were
no
levitts
the
miss
andersons
had
not
entered
deerbrook
for
weeks
and
maria
young
sat
alone
in
the
large
double
pew
commonly
occupied
by
her
scholars
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
poor
but
hester
observed
that
every
one
in
the
church
was
in
mourning
but
maria
and
herself
it
looked
sadly
chill
and
dreary
the
sights
and
sounds
she
had
met
and
the
aspect
of
the
place
she
was
in
disposed
her
to
welcome
every
thought
of
comfort
that
the
voice
of
the
preacher
could
convey
there
were
others
to
whom
consolation
appeared
even
more
necessary
than
to
herself
philip
enderby
had
certainly
seen
her
and
was
distressed
at
it
he
could
not
have
expected
to
meet
her
here
and
his
discomposure
was
obvious
he
looked
thin
and
grave
not
to
say
subdued
hester
was
surprised
to
find
how
she
relented
towards
him
the
moment
she
saw
he
was
not
gay
and
careless
and
how
her
feelings
grew
softer
and
softer
under
the
religious
emotions
of
the
hour
she
was
so
near
forgiving
him
that
she
was
very
glad
margaret
was
not
by
her
side
if
she
could
forgive
how
would
it
be
with
margaret
the
next
most
melancholy
person
present
perhaps
was
mr
walcot
he
knew
that
the
whole
family
of
the
rowlands
remained
in
deerbrook
from
mrs
rowland
ostentation
of
confidence
in
his
skill
he
knew
that
mr
rowland
would
have
removed
his
family
when
the
greys
departed
but
that
the
lady
had
refused
to
go
and
he
felt
how
groundless
was
her
confidence
not
that
he
had
pretended
to
more
professional
merit
than
he
had
believed
himself
to
possess
but
that
amidst
this
disease
he
was
like
a
in
the
stream
he
became
so
impressed
with
his
responsibilities
now
in
the
presence
of
the
small
and
congregation
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
whispering
to
hester
that
he
could
never
be
thankful
enough
that
mr
hope
had
not
left
deerbrook
long
ago
and
that
he
hoped
they
should
be
friends
henceforth
that
mr
hope
would
take
his
proper
place
again
and
forgive
and
forget
all
that
had
passed
he
thought
he
might
trust
mr
hope
not
to
desert
him
and
deerbrook
now
hester
smiled
gently
but
made
no
reply
and
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
proffered
hand
it
was
no
time
or
place
to
ratify
a
compact
for
her
husband
in
his
absence
all
this
time
mr
countenance
and
manner
were
sufficiently
subdued
but
his
agitation
increased
when
the
solemn
voice
of
dr
levitt
uttered
the
prayer
have
pity
upon
us
miserable
sinners
who
now
are
visited
with
great
sickness
and
mortality
here
the
voice
of
weeping
became
so
audible
from
the
lower
part
of
the
church
that
the
preacher
stopped
for
a
moment
to
give
other
people
and
possibly
himself
time
to
recover
composure
he
then
went
on
that
like
as
thou
didst
then
accept
of
an
atonement
and
didst
command
the
destroying
angel
to
cease
from
punishing
so
it
may
now
please
thee
to
withdraw
from
us
this
plague
and
grievous
sickness
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
every
voice
in
the
church
uttered
except
mr
walcot
he
was
struggling
with
his
sobs
unexpected
and
excessive
as
were
the
tokens
of
his
grief
hester
could
not
but
respect
it
it
was
so
much
better
than
gross
selfishness
and
carelessness
that
she
could
pity
and
almost
honour
it
she
felt
that
mr
walcot
was
as
far
superior
to
the
quacks
who
were
making
a
market
of
the
credulity
of
the
suffering
people
as
her
husband
with
his
professional
decision
his
manly
composure
and
his
forgetfulness
of
the
injuries
of
his
foes
in
their
hour
of
suffering
was
above
mr
walcot
the
poor
young
man
drank
in
as
if
they
were
direct
from
heaven
the
suggestions
contained
in
the
preacher
plain
sermon
on
the
duties
of
the
time
plain
it
was
indeed
familiarly
practical
to
an
unexampled
degree
so
that
most
of
his
hearers
quitted
the
church
with
a
far
clearer
notion
of
their
business
as
nurses
and
neighbours
than
they
had
ever
before
had
the
effect
was
visible
as
they
left
their
seats
in
the
brightening
of
their
countenances
and
the
increased
activity
of
their
step
as
they
walked
there
go
said
hester
kindly
to
her
companion
many
must
be
wanting
you
but
you
have
lost
no
time
by
coming
here
no
indeed
but
mr
hope
rely
upon
him
he
will
do
his
duty
go
and
do
yours
god
bless
you
cried
walcot
squeezing
her
hand
affectionately
mrs
rowland
saw
this
as
she
always
saw
everything
she
beckoned
to
mr
walcot
with
her
most
engaging
smile
and
whispered
him
with
an
air
of
the
most
intimate
confidence
till
she
saw
that
her
presence
was
wanted
elsewhere
when
she
let
him
go
mr
rowland
followed
by
philip
slipped
out
of
his
pew
as
hester
passed
and
walked
down
the
aisle
with
her
he
was
glad
to
see
her
there
he
hoped
it
was
a
proof
that
all
her
household
were
well
in
this
sickly
time
philip
bent
forward
to
hear
the
answer
mr
rowland
went
on
to
say
how
still
and
dull
the
village
was
the
shutters
up
or
the
blinds
down
at
all
the
greys
windows
looked
quite
sad
and
he
never
saw
any
of
his
friends
from
the
in
the
shrubbery
now
they
had
too
many
painful
duties
he
feared
to
allow
of
their
permitting
themselves
such
pleasures
but
his
friends
must
take
care
not
to
overstrain
their
powers
they
and
he
must
be
very
thankful
that
their
respective
households
were
thus
far
unvisited
by
the
disease
and
they
should
all
in
his
opinion
favour
their
health
by
the
indulgence
of
a
little
rational
cheerfulness
hester
smiled
aware
that
never
had
their
household
been
more
cheerful
than
now
whether
it
was
that
hester
smile
was
irresistible
or
that
other
influences
were
combined
with
it
it
had
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
philip
he
started
forward
in
front
of
her
and
offered
his
hand
saying
so
as
to
be
heard
by
her
alone
will
you
not
i
have
no
quarrel
with
you
and
can
you
suppose
she
replied
in
a
tone
more
of
compassion
than
of
anger
that
i
have
none
with
you
how
strangely
you
must
forget
she
added
as
he
precipitately
withdrew
his
offered
hand
and
turned
from
her
forget
i
forget
he
murmured
turning
his
face
of
woe
towards
her
for
one
instant
how
little
you
know
me
how
little
we
all
know
each
other
said
hester
for
the
moment
careless
what
construction
might
be
put
upon
her
words
even
in
this
place
said
dr
levitt
who
had
now
joined
them
and
had
heard
the
last
words
even
in
this
place
where
all
hearts
should
be
open
and
all
resentments
forgotten
are
there
any
here
who
refuse
to
shake
hands
at
such
a
time
as
this
it
is
not
for
myself
said
hester
distressed
but
how
can
i
it
is
true
she
can
not
do
not
blame
her
dr
levitt
said
philip
and
he
was
gone
it
was
this
meeting
which
had
cut
short
mrs
rowland
whispers
with
mr
walcot
and
brought
her
down
the
aisle
in
all
her
stateliness
with
her
train
of
children
behind
her
when
hester
went
home
she
thought
it
right
to
tell
margaret
exactly
what
had
happened
i
knew
it
was
all
that
margaret
said
but
her
heightened
colour
during
the
day
told
what
unspeakable
things
were
in
her
heart
hester
was
occupied
with
speculations
as
to
what
might
have
been
the
event
if
margaret
had
been
to
church
instead
of
herself
her
husband
would
only
shake
his
head
and
look
hopeless
but
she
still
thought
all
might
have
come
right
under
the
influences
of
the
hour
whether
it
were
to
be
wished
that
philip
and
margaret
should
understand
each
other
again
was
another
question
yesterday
hester
would
have
earnestly
desired
that
margaret
should
never
see
enderby
again
she
did
not
know
what
to
wish
she
and
margaret
came
silently
to
the
same
conclusion
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
waiting
if
he
had
heard
this
hope
would
have
shaken
his
head
again
chapter
forty
three
working
round
several
days
passed
and
there
was
no
direct
news
of
enderby
maria
never
spoke
of
him
though
many
little
intervals
in
margaret
busy
life
occurred
when
the
friends
were
together
and
maria
ought
have
taken
occasion
to
say
anything
she
wished
it
was
clear
that
she
chose
to
avoid
the
subject
her
talk
was
almost
entirely
about
the
sick
for
whom
she
laboured
as
strenuously
as
her
strength
would
permit
she
could
not
go
about
among
them
nor
sit
up
with
the
sufferers
but
she
cooked
good
things
over
her
fire
for
them
all
day
long
and
she
took
to
her
home
many
children
who
were
too
young
to
be
useful
and
old
enough
to
be
troublesome
in
a
sick
house
between
her
cooking
teaching
and
playing
with
the
children
she
was
as
fully
occupied
as
her
friends
in
the
and
perhaps
might
not
really
know
anything
about
mr
enderby
each
one
of
the
family
had
caught
glimpses
of
him
at
one
time
or
another
there
was
reason
to
think
that
he
was
active
among
mr
walcot
poor
patients
and
hope
had
encountered
him
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
his
rounds
when
a
few
words
on
the
business
of
the
moment
were
exchanged
and
nothing
more
happened
margaret
saw
him
twice
once
on
horseback
when
he
turned
suddenly
down
a
lane
to
avoid
her
and
at
the
rowlands
window
with
ned
in
his
arms
she
never
now
passed
that
house
when
she
could
help
it
but
this
once
it
was
necessary
and
she
was
glad
that
philip
had
certainly
not
seen
her
his
back
was
to
the
window
at
the
moment
as
if
some
one
within
was
speaking
to
him
each
time
his
image
was
so
stamped
in
upon
her
mind
that
amidst
all
the
trials
of
such
near
neighbourhood
without
intercourse
his
presence
in
deerbrook
was
on
the
whole
certainly
a
luxury
she
had
gained
something
to
compensate
for
all
her
restlessness
in
the
three
glimpses
of
him
with
which
she
had
now
been
favoured
a
thought
sometimes
occurred
to
her
of
which
she
was
so
ashamed
that
she
made
every
endeavour
to
banish
it
she
asked
herself
now
and
then
whether
if
she
had
been
able
to
sit
at
home
or
take
her
accustomed
walks
she
should
not
have
beheld
philip
oftener
whether
she
was
not
sadly
out
of
the
way
of
seeing
him
at
the
cottage
in
the
lane
and
the
other
sordid
places
where
her
presence
was
necessary
not
for
this
occasional
question
did
she
stay
away
one
moment
longer
than
she
would
otherwise
have
done
from
the
cottage
in
the
lane
but
while
she
was
there
it
was
apt
to
recur
there
she
sat
one
afternoon
somewhat
weary
but
not
dreaming
of
going
home
there
lay
the
three
sick
creatures
still
the
woman
was
likely
to
recover
the
boy
lingered
and
seemed
waiting
for
his
father
to
go
with
him
platt
had
sunk
very
rapidly
and
this
day
had
made
a
great
change
margaret
had
taken
the
moaning
and
restless
child
on
her
lap
for
the
ease
of
change
of
posture
and
she
was
now
shading
from
his
eyes
with
her
shawl
the
last
level
rays
of
the
sun
which
shone
in
upon
her
from
the
window
she
was
unwilling
to
change
her
seat
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
slightest
movement
would
quench
the
lingering
life
of
the
child
and
there
was
no
one
to
draw
the
the
old
woman
having
gone
to
buy
food
in
the
village
mrs
platt
slept
almost
all
the
day
and
night
through
and
she
was
asleep
now
so
margaret
sat
quite
still
holding
up
her
shawl
before
the
pallid
face
which
looked
already
dead
nothing
broke
the
silence
but
the
twitter
of
the
young
birds
in
the
thatch
and
the
mutterings
of
the
sick
man
whom
margaret
imagined
to
be
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
unusual
light
that
was
in
the
room
it
had
not
been
the
custom
of
the
sun
to
shine
into
any
houses
of
late
and
the
place
full
of
yellow
light
did
not
look
like
itself
she
knew
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
sun
would
have
set
and
she
hoped
that
then
poor
platt
would
be
still
meantime
she
appeared
to
take
no
notice
but
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
boy
face
marking
that
each
sigh
was
fainter
than
the
last
at
length
a
louder
sound
than
she
had
yet
heard
from
the
sick
man
made
her
look
towards
him
and
the
instant
throb
of
her
heart
seemed
to
be
felt
by
the
child
for
he
moved
his
head
slightly
platt
was
trying
to
support
himself
upon
his
elbow
while
in
the
other
shaking
hand
he
held
towards
her
her
turquoise
ring
she
remembered
her
charge
and
did
not
spring
to
seize
it
but
there
was
something
in
her
countenance
that
strongly
excited
the
sick
man
he
struggled
to
rise
from
his
bed
and
his
face
was
fierce
margaret
spoke
gently
as
calmly
as
she
could
told
him
she
would
come
presently
that
there
was
no
hurry
and
urged
him
to
lie
down
till
she
could
put
the
child
off
her
lap
but
her
voice
failed
her
in
spite
of
herself
for
now
at
last
she
recognised
in
platt
the
tall
woman
this
was
the
look
which
had
perplexed
her
more
than
once
patience
a
little
further
patience
she
said
to
herself
as
she
saw
the
ring
still
trembling
in
the
sick
man
hand
and
felt
one
more
sigh
from
the
little
fellow
on
her
lap
no
more
patience
was
needed
this
was
the
boy
last
breath
his
head
fell
back
and
the
sunlight
which
streamed
in
upon
his
eyes
could
now
disturb
them
no
more
margaret
gently
closed
them
and
laid
the
body
on
its
little
bed
in
the
corner
straightening
and
covering
the
limbs
before
she
turned
away
she
then
gently
approached
the
bed
and
took
her
ring
into
a
hand
which
trembled
little
less
than
the
sick
man
own
she
spoke
calmly
however
she
strove
earnestly
to
learn
something
of
the
facts
she
tried
to
understand
the
mutterings
amidst
which
only
a
word
here
and
there
sounded
like
speech
she
thought
from
the
earnestness
with
which
platt
seized
and
pressed
her
hand
that
he
was
seeking
pardon
from
her
and
she
spoke
as
if
it
were
so
it
grew
very
distressing
the
earnestness
of
the
man
and
the
uncertainty
whether
his
mind
was
wandering
or
not
she
wished
the
old
woman
would
come
back
she
went
to
the
door
to
look
for
her
the
old
woman
was
coming
down
the
lane
margaret
put
on
her
ring
and
drew
on
her
gloves
and
determined
to
say
nothing
about
it
at
present
mr
platt
has
been
talking
almost
ever
since
you
went
said
margaret
and
i
can
make
out
nothing
that
he
says
do
try
if
you
can
understand
him
i
am
sure
there
is
something
he
wishes
me
to
hear
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
am
afraid
do
try
the
woman
coaxed
him
to
lie
down
and
then
turning
round
said
she
thought
he
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
is
that
all
tell
him
that
the
sun
is
now
setting
but
if
you
have
a
watch
that
will
show
more
exactly
are
you
sure
you
have
no
watch
in
the
house
the
old
woman
looked
suspiciously
at
her
and
asked
her
what
made
her
suppose
that
poor
folks
had
watches
when
some
gentlefolks
had
none
margaret
inquired
whether
a
watch
was
not
a
possession
handed
down
from
father
to
son
and
sometimes
found
in
the
poorest
cottages
she
believed
she
had
seen
such
at
deerbrook
the
old
woman
replied
by
saying
she
believed
margaret
might
have
understood
some
few
things
among
the
many
the
poor
sick
creature
had
been
saying
not
one
margaret
declared
but
it
was
so
plain
that
she
was
not
believed
that
she
had
little
doubt
of
hester
watch
having
been
harboured
in
this
very
house
if
it
was
not
there
still
the
poor
boy
who
had
had
little
care
from
his
natural
guardians
while
alive
from
the
hour
of
his
being
doomed
by
the
was
now
loudly
mourned
as
dead
yet
the
mourning
was
strangely
mixed
with
exultation
at
the
having
been
right
in
the
end
the
mother
suddenly
awakened
groaned
and
screamed
so
that
it
was
fearful
to
hear
her
all
efforts
to
restore
quiet
were
in
vain
margaret
was
moved
shocked
terrified
she
could
not
keep
her
own
calmness
in
such
a
scene
of
confusion
but
while
her
cheeks
were
covered
with
tears
while
her
voice
trembled
as
she
implored
silence
she
never
took
off
her
glove
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
platt
sank
back
and
died
the
renewed
cries
had
the
effect
of
bringing
some
neighbours
from
the
end
of
the
lane
while
they
were
there
margaret
could
be
of
no
further
use
she
promised
to
send
coffins
immediately
that
stage
of
pestilence
being
now
reached
when
coffins
were
the
first
consideration
and
then
slipped
out
from
the
door
into
the
darkness
and
ran
till
she
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
long
lane
she
usually
considered
herself
safe
abroad
even
in
times
like
these
as
she
carried
no
property
of
value
about
with
her
but
now
that
she
was
wearing
her
precious
ring
again
she
felt
too
rich
to
be
walking
alone
in
the
dark
she
did
not
slacken
her
pace
till
she
approached
lights
and
people
and
then
she
was
glad
to
stop
for
breath
she
could
not
resist
going
first
to
maria
to
show
her
the
recovered
treasure
and
this
caused
her
to
direct
her
steps
through
the
churchyard
it
was
there
that
she
came
in
view
of
lights
and
people
and
under
the
limes
it
was
that
she
stopped
for
breath
the
churchyard
was
now
the
most
frequented
spot
in
the
village
the
path
by
the
turnstile
was
indeed
grown
over
with
grass
but
the
great
gate
was
almost
always
open
and
the
ground
near
it
was
trodden
bare
by
the
feet
of
many
mourners
funeral
trains
trains
which
daily
grew
shorter
till
each
coffin
was
now
followed
only
by
two
or
by
three
were
passing
in
from
early
morning
at
intervals
till
sunset
and
now
might
be
often
seen
by
torchlight
far
into
the
night
the
villager
passing
the
churchyard
wall
might
hear
in
the
night
air
the
deep
voice
of
the
clergyman
announcing
the
farewell
to
some
brother
or
sister
committing
ashes
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
there
was
no
disturbance
now
from
boys
leaping
over
the
graves
or
from
little
children
eager
to
renew
their
noisy
play
such
of
the
young
villagers
as
remained
above
ground
appeared
to
be
silenced
and
subdued
by
the
privation
the
dreariness
the
neglect
of
these
awful
days
they
looked
on
from
afar
or
avoided
the
spot
instead
of
such
the
observer
of
the
two
funerals
which
were
now
in
the
churchyard
was
a
person
quite
at
the
other
extremity
of
life
margaret
saw
the
man
of
a
hundred
years
jem
bird
the
pride
of
the
village
in
his
way
seated
on
the
bench
under
the
spreading
tree
which
was
youthful
in
comparison
with
himself
he
was
listlessly
watching
the
black
figures
which
moved
about
in
the
light
of
a
solitary
torch
by
an
open
grave
while
waiting
for
the
clergyman
who
was
engaged
with
the
group
beyond
you
are
late
abroad
mr
bird
said
margaret
i
should
not
have
looked
for
you
here
so
far
on
in
the
evening
what
your
will
said
the
old
man
grandfather
wo
go
home
ever
till
they
have
done
here
said
a
of
the
old
man
running
up
from
his
amusement
of
hooting
to
the
owls
in
the
church
tower
they
soon
have
done
with
these
two
and
then
grandfather
and
i
shall
go
home
wo
we
granny
does
it
not
make
you
sad
to
see
so
many
funerals
said
margaret
sitting
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
ay
had
you
not
better
stay
at
home
than
see
so
many
that
you
knew
laid
in
the
ground
does
he
understand
she
asked
aside
of
the
boy
does
he
never
answer
but
in
this
way
oh
he
talks
fast
enough
sometimes
it
is
just
as
you
happen
to
take
him
margaret
was
curious
to
know
what
were
the
meditations
among
the
tombs
of
one
so
aged
as
this
man
so
she
spoke
again
i
have
heard
that
you
knew
this
place
before
anybody
lived
in
it
and
now
you
seem
likely
to
see
it
empty
again
it
was
a
wild
place
enough
in
my
young
time
said
jem
speaking
now
very
fluently
there
was
nothing
of
it
but
the
church
and
that
was
never
used
because
it
had
had
its
roof
pulled
off
in
the
wars
there
was
only
a
footpath
to
it
through
the
fields
then
and
few
people
went
nigh
it
except
a
few
gentry
that
came
here
into
the
woods
the
owls
and
i
knew
it
as
well
then
as
we
do
and
nobody
else
that
is
now
living
the
owls
and
i
and
the
old
man
laughed
the
chuckling
laugh
which
was
all
he
had
strength
for
the
woods
said
margaret
did
the
verdon
woods
spread
as
far
as
this
church
in
those
days
and
were
they
not
private
property
then
it
was
all
forest
hereabouts
except
a
clear
space
round
the
church
tower
it
might
be
thin
sprinkled
but
it
was
called
forest
the
place
where
i
was
born
had
thorns
all
about
it
and
when
i
could
scarce
walk
alone
i
used
to
scramble
among
the
blossoms
that
made
the
ground
white
all
under
those
thorns
the
birds
that
lived
by
the
haws
in
winter
were
prodigious
that
cottage
stood
as
near
as
i
can
tell
where
grey
and
rowland
great
granary
is
now
there
used
to
be
much
swine
in
the
woods
then
and
many
the
time
they
have
thrown
me
down
when
i
was
a
young
thing
getting
acorns
that
was
about
the
time
of
my
hearing
the
first
music
i
ever
heard
unless
you
call
the
singing
of
the
birds
music
we
had
plenty
of
that
and
the
bells
on
the
breeze
from
a
distance
when
the
wind
was
south
the
first
music
so
to
call
it
that
i
heard
was
from
a
blind
fiddler
that
came
to
us
what
brought
him
i
know
whether
he
lost
his
way
or
what
but
he
lost
his
way
after
he
left
us
his
dog
seems
to
have
been
in
fault
but
he
got
into
a
pool
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
and
there
he
lay
drowned
with
one
foot
up
on
the
bank
when
i
went
to
see
what
the
harking
of
the
dog
could
be
about
he
clutched
his
fiddle
in
drowning
and
i
remember
i
tried
to
get
the
music
out
of
it
as
it
lay
wet
and
broken
on
the
bank
while
father
was
saying
the
poor
soul
must
have
been
under
the
water
now
two
days
so
i
have
reason
to
remember
the
first
music
i
heard
you
have
got
him
talking
now
said
the
grandchild
running
off
and
presently
the
owls
were
heard
hooting
again
whereabouts
was
this
pool
asked
margaret
it
is
a
deep
part
of
the
brook
that
in
hot
summers
is
left
a
pond
it
is
there
that
the
chief
of
the
sliding
goes
on
in
winter
now
in
the
meadow
it
is
meadow
now
but
then
the
deer
used
to
come
down
through
the
wood
to
drink
at
the
brook
there
that
is
how
the
village
got
its
name
so
you
remember
the
time
when
the
deer
came
down
to
drink
at
the
brook
how
many
things
have
happened
since
then
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
music
since
those
days
ay
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
fiddling
at
our
weddings
since
that
and
we
have
had
recruiting
parties
through
in
war
times
and
many
a
mother
singing
to
her
baby
and
the
psalm
in
the
church
for
so
many
years
yes
the
place
has
been
full
of
music
for
long
but
it
seems
likely
to
be
silent
enough
now
i
began
to
think
i
should
be
left
the
last
as
i
was
the
first
said
the
old
man
but
they
say
the
sickness
is
abating
now
and
that
several
are
beginning
to
recover
pray
god
it
may
be
so
first
after
the
wood
was
somewhat
cleared
there
was
a
labourer
cottage
or
two
now
standing
empty
and
the
folk
that
lived
in
them
lying
yonder
then
there
was
the
farmhouse
and
then
a
carpenter
came
and
a
wheeler
then
there
was
a
shop
wanted
and
the
church
was
roofed
in
and
used
and
some
gentry
came
and
sat
down
by
the
river
side
and
the
place
grew
to
what
it
is
they
say
now
it
is
not
near
its
end
yet
but
it
is
strange
to
me
to
see
the
churchyard
the
fullest
place
near
so
that
i
have
to
come
here
for
company
and
the
old
man
chuckled
again
as
she
rose
to
go
margaret
asked
whether
he
knew
the
platts
who
lived
in
the
cottage
in
the
lane
i
know
him
to
see
to
is
he
down
he
is
dead
and
his
child
but
his
wife
is
recovering
ay
there
many
recovering
now
they
say
indeed
who
why
a
many
but
the
fever
has
got
into
rowland
house
they
say
margaret
heart
turned
sick
at
hearing
these
words
and
she
hastily
pursued
her
way
it
was
not
philip
however
who
was
seized
he
was
in
the
churchyard
at
this
moment
she
saw
him
walking
quickly
along
the
turnstile
path
slackening
his
pace
only
for
a
moment
as
he
passed
the
funeral
group
the
light
from
the
torch
shone
full
upon
his
face
the
face
settled
and
composed
as
she
knew
it
would
not
be
if
he
were
aware
who
was
within
a
few
paces
of
him
she
felt
the
strongest
impulse
to
show
him
her
ring
the
strongest
desire
for
his
sympathy
in
its
recovery
but
an
instant
showed
her
the
absurdity
of
the
thought
and
she
hung
down
her
blushing
head
in
the
darkness
from
maria
she
had
sympathy
such
as
it
was
sympathy
without
any
faith
in
philip
she
had
from
her
also
good
news
of
the
state
of
the
village
there
were
recoveries
talked
of
and
there
would
be
more
now
that
those
who
were
seized
would
no
longer
consider
death
inevitable
mrs
howell
was
ill
and
poor
miss
nares
was
down
with
the
fever
which
no
one
could
wonder
at
but
mr
jones
and
his
son
john
were
both
out
of
danger
and
the
little
tuckers
were
likely
to
do
well
mr
james
was
already
talking
of
sending
for
his
wife
and
home
again
as
the
worst
days
of
the
disease
seemed
to
be
past
and
so
many
families
had
not
been
attacked
at
all
it
was
too
true
that
matilda
rowland
was
unwell
but
mr
walcot
hoped
it
was
only
a
slight
feverish
attack
which
would
be
thought
nothing
of
under
any
other
on
the
whole
maria
thought
the
neighbours
she
had
seen
in
better
spirits
than
at
any
time
since
the
fever
made
its
appearance
margaret
found
more
good
news
at
home
in
the
first
place
the
door
was
opened
to
her
by
morris
hester
stood
behind
to
witness
the
meeting
she
had
her
bonnet
on
she
was
going
with
her
husband
to
see
mrs
howell
and
make
some
provision
for
her
comfort
but
she
had
waited
a
little
while
in
hopes
that
margaret
would
return
and
be
duly
astonished
to
see
morris
you
must
make
tea
for
each
other
and
be
comfortable
while
we
are
away
said
hester
we
will
go
now
directly
that
we
may
be
back
as
early
as
we
can
i
have
several
things
to
tell
you
said
margaret
when
you
return
and
one
now
brother
which
must
not
be
delayed
platt
and
his
child
are
dead
and
coffins
must
be
sent
the
sooner
the
better
or
we
shall
lose
the
poor
woman
too
hope
promised
to
speak
to
the
undertaker
as
he
went
by
we
have
become
very
familiar
with
death
morris
since
you
went
away
said
margaret
as
she
obliged
her
old
friend
to
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
prepared
to
make
tea
for
both
that
is
why
you
see
me
here
miss
margaret
every
piece
of
news
i
could
get
of
this
place
was
worse
than
the
last
and
i
could
perceive
from
your
last
letter
that
you
had
sickness
all
about
you
and
i
could
not
persuade
myself
but
that
it
was
my
duty
to
come
and
be
useful
and
to
take
care
of
you
my
dear
if
i
may
say
so
and
now
you
are
here
i
trust
you
may
stay
i
trust
we
may
be
justified
in
keeping
you
we
have
meat
every
day
now
morris
at
least
when
we
have
time
to
cook
it
since
my
brother
has
been
attending
so
many
of
mr
jones
family
we
have
had
meat
almost
every
day
indeed
my
dear
i
do
know
how
you
could
keep
up
without
it
so
busy
as
i
find
you
are
among
the
sick
busy
night
and
day
my
mistress
tells
me
till
the
people
have
got
to
call
you
good
lady
you
do
not
look
as
if
you
had
lost
much
of
your
natural
rest
but
i
know
how
the
mind
keeps
the
body
up
yours
is
an
earnest
mind
margaret
that
will
always
keep
you
up
but
my
dear
i
do
hope
it
has
been
an
easy
mind
too
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
margaret
more
than
excused
it
but
she
could
not
immediately
answer
the
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
and
her
lip
quivered
when
she
would
have
spoken
morris
stroked
her
hair
and
kissed
her
forehead
as
if
she
had
been
still
a
child
and
whispered
that
all
things
ended
well
in
own
time
oh
yes
i
know
said
margaret
has
hester
told
you
how
prosperous
we
are
growing
i
do
not
mean
only
about
money
we
are
likely
to
have
enough
of
that
too
for
my
brother
old
patients
have
almost
all
sent
for
him
again
but
we
care
the
less
about
that
from
having
discovered
that
we
were
as
happy
with
little
money
as
with
much
but
it
is
a
satisfaction
and
pleasure
to
find
my
brother
regarded
more
and
more
as
he
ought
to
be
and
yet
greater
to
see
how
nobly
he
deserves
the
best
that
can
be
thought
of
him
he
forgives
his
enemies
no
doubt
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
their
heads
you
will
witness
it
morris
you
will
see
him
among
them
and
it
will
make
your
heart
glow
poor
creatures
i
have
heard
some
of
them
own
to
him
from
their
sick
beds
with
dread
and
tears
that
they
broke
his
windows
and
slandered
his
name
then
you
should
see
him
smile
when
he
tells
them
that
is
all
over
now
and
that
they
will
not
mistake
him
so
much
again
no
never
he
has
shown
himself
now
what
he
is
he
sat
up
two
nights
with
one
poor
boy
who
is
now
likely
to
get
through
and
in
the
middle
of
the
second
night
the
boy
father
got
up
from
his
sick
bed
in
the
next
room
and
came
to
my
brother
to
say
that
he
felt
that
ill
luck
would
be
upon
them
all
if
he
did
not
confess
that
he
put
that
very
boy
behind
the
hedge
with
stones
in
his
hand
to
throw
at
edward
the
day
he
was
mobbed
at
the
almshouses
he
was
deluded
by
the
neighbours
he
said
into
thinking
that
my
brother
meant
ill
by
the
poor
they
have
learned
to
the
contrary
now
my
dear
and
what
does
sir
william
hunter
say
of
my
master
do
you
know
there
is
very
little
heard
of
sir
william
and
lady
hunter
at
present
shut
up
at
home
as
they
are
but
dr
levitt
who
loves
to
make
peace
you
know
and
tell
what
is
pleasant
declares
that
sir
william
hunter
has
certainly
said
that
after
all
it
does
not
so
much
signify
which
way
a
man
votes
at
an
election
if
he
shows
a
kind
heart
to
his
neighbours
in
troublesome
times
sir
william
hunter
has
learned
his
lesson
then
it
seems
from
this
affliction
i
suppose
he
sees
that
one
who
does
his
duty
as
my
master
does
at
a
season
like
this
is
just
the
one
to
vote
according
to
his
conscience
at
an
election
but
my
dear
what
sort
of
a
heart
have
these
hunters
got
that
they
shut
themselves
up
as
you
say
they
give
their
money
freely
and
that
is
all
that
we
can
expect
from
them
if
they
have
always
been
brought
up
and
accustomed
to
fear
sickness
and
danger
and
death
we
can
not
expect
that
they
should
lose
their
fear
at
a
time
like
this
we
must
be
thankful
for
what
they
give
and
their
money
has
been
of
great
service
though
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
example
would
have
been
of
more
one
would
like
to
look
into
their
minds
and
see
how
they
regard
my
master
there
they
regard
him
no
doubt
so
far
rightly
as
to
consider
him
quite
a
different
sort
of
person
from
themselves
and
no
rule
for
them
so
far
they
are
right
they
do
not
comprehend
his
satisfactions
and
ease
of
mind
and
it
is
very
likely
that
they
have
pleasures
of
their
own
which
we
do
not
understand
and
they
are
quite
welcome
i
am
sure
my
dear
as
long
as
they
do
not
meddle
with
my
master
name
that
is
as
he
says
all
over
now
after
this
however
the
people
in
deerbrook
will
be
more
ready
to
trust
in
my
master
skill
and
kindness
than
in
sir
william
hunter
grandeur
and
money
which
can
do
little
to
save
them
in
time
of
need
margaret
explained
how
ignorantly
the
poor
in
the
neighbourhood
had
relied
on
the
who
had
only
duped
them
how
that
which
would
have
been
religion
in
them
if
they
had
been
early
taught
and
which
would
have
enabled
them
to
rely
on
the
only
power
which
really
can
save
had
been
degraded
by
ignorance
into
a
foolish
and
pernicious
superstition
morris
hoped
that
this
also
was
over
now
she
had
met
some
of
these
conjurors
on
the
blickley
road
and
seen
others
breaking
up
their
establishment
in
the
lanes
and
turning
their
backs
upon
deerbrook
whether
they
were
scared
away
by
the
mortality
of
the
place
or
had
found
the
tide
of
beginning
to
turn
mattered
nothing
as
long
as
they
were
gone
the
was
cleared
and
morris
and
margaret
were
admiring
the
baby
as
he
slept
when
hester
and
her
husband
returned
mrs
howell
was
very
unwell
and
likely
to
be
worse
all
attempts
to
bring
miss
miskin
to
reason
and
induce
her
to
enter
her
friend
room
were
in
vain
she
bestowed
abundance
of
tears
tremors
and
foreboding
on
mrs
state
and
prospects
but
shut
herself
up
in
a
fumigated
apartment
where
she
promised
to
pray
for
a
good
result
and
to
await
it
the
maid
was
a
hearty
lass
who
would
sit
up
willingly
under
hester
promise
that
she
should
be
relieved
in
the
morning
the
girl
fear
was
of
not
being
able
to
satisfy
her
mistress
whom
it
was
not
so
easy
to
nurse
as
it
might
have
been
from
her
insisting
on
having
everything
arranged
precisely
as
it
was
in
her
poor
dear
howell
last
illness
as
miss
miskin
had
refused
to
enter
the
chamber
hester
had
been
obliged
to
search
a
chest
of
drawers
for
mr
howell
last
which
miss
miskin
had
promised
should
be
mended
and
aired
and
ready
for
wear
by
the
morning
margaret
cried
hester
as
her
sister
was
lighting
her
candle
the
exclamation
made
edward
turn
round
and
brought
back
morris
into
the
parlour
after
saying
margaret
your
ring
there
was
as
much
joy
as
shame
in
margaret
crimson
blush
she
let
her
sister
examine
the
turquoise
and
said
yes
this
is
the
boon
of
edward
hundred
pounds
has
come
said
hester
but
that
is
nothing
to
this
margaret
eyes
thanked
her
she
just
explained
that
poor
platt
had
been
the
thief
and
had
restored
it
to
her
before
he
died
and
that
she
could
get
no
explanation
no
tidings
of
hester
watch
and
she
was
gone
dr
levitt
early
stir
about
this
ring
prevented
its
being
disposed
of
i
have
no
doubt
said
edward
if
so
it
is
yet
possible
that
we
may
recover
your
watch
i
will
speak
to
dr
levitt
in
the
morning
dear
margaret
said
hester
she
is
now
drinking
in
the
hue
of
that
turquoise
and
blessing
it
for
being
unchanged
she
regards
this
recovery
of
it
as
a
good
omen
i
see
and
far
be
it
from
us
to
mock
at
such
a
superstition
as
usual
when
she
was
upon
this
subject
hester
looked
up
into
her
husband
face
and
as
usual
when
she
spoke
on
this
subject
he
made
no
reply
chapter
forty
four
late
religion
a
few
days
after
morris
return
she
told
margaret
that
the
tidings
in
the
village
of
miss
rowland
illness
were
not
good
mrs
rowland
was
quite
as
sure
as
ever
that
if
anybody
could
cure
matilda
it
was
mr
walcot
but
mr
walcot
himself
looked
anxious
and
a
bed
had
been
put
up
for
him
in
the
room
next
to
the
sick
child
margaret
wondered
why
mr
rowland
did
not
send
to
blickley
for
further
advice
but
morris
thought
that
mrs
rowland
would
not
give
up
her
perfect
faith
in
mr
walcot
if
all
her
children
should
die
before
her
face
when
morris
had
left
the
room
margaret
was
absorbed
in
speculations
as
she
played
with
her
sister
infant
speculations
on
the
little
life
of
children
and
on
their
death
her
memory
followed
matilda
through
every
circumstance
in
which
she
had
seen
her
the
poor
little
girl
very
attitude
voice
and
words
words
full
alas
of
folly
and
vanity
rose
again
upon
her
eye
and
ear
in
immediate
contrast
with
the
image
of
death
and
the
solemnity
of
the
life
to
come
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
came
tears
of
shame
and
for
another
thought
how
low
how
selfish
thrust
itself
in
among
them
that
she
was
secure
for
the
present
from
philip
departure
that
he
would
not
leave
deerbrook
while
matilda
was
in
a
critical
state
as
these
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
the
baby
looked
full
in
her
face
and
caught
the
infection
of
grief
he
hung
his
little
lip
and
looked
so
that
margaret
dashed
away
the
signs
of
her
sorrow
and
spoke
gaily
to
him
and
as
the
sun
shone
in
at
the
moment
upon
the
lustres
on
the
mantelpiece
she
set
the
in
motion
and
let
the
baby
try
to
catch
the
bright
colours
that
danced
upon
the
walls
and
ceiling
at
this
moment
hester
burst
in
with
a
countenance
of
dismay
margaret
my
husband
has
a
headache
a
headache
was
no
trifle
in
these
days
anything
more
than
a
headache
asked
margaret
no
other
feeling
of
illness
there
is
nothing
to
wonder
at
in
a
mere
headache
it
is
very
surprising
that
he
has
not
had
it
before
with
all
his
toil
and
want
of
sleep
he
declares
it
is
a
trifle
said
hester
but
i
see
he
can
hardly
hold
up
what
shall
i
do
make
him
lie
down
and
rest
and
let
me
go
to
mrs
howell
instead
of
you
she
will
be
a
little
disappointed
but
that
can
not
be
helped
she
must
put
up
with
my
services
now
do
not
frighten
yourself
as
if
no
one
ever
had
a
headache
without
having
a
fever
i
shall
desire
morris
to
let
no
one
in
and
to
bring
no
messages
to
her
master
while
his
headache
lasts
very
right
i
will
tell
her
as
i
go
for
my
bonnet
one
more
kiss
before
i
go
baby
do
not
wait
tea
for
me
hester
i
can
not
say
when
i
shall
be
back
margaret
had
been
gone
to
mrs
howell
about
an
hour
and
a
half
when
there
was
a
loud
and
hasty
knock
at
the
door
of
the
it
roused
hope
from
a
doze
into
which
he
had
just
fallen
and
provoked
hester
accordingly
there
was
a
parley
between
morris
and
somebody
in
the
hall
and
presently
a
voice
was
heard
calling
loudly
upon
mr
hope
hester
could
not
prevent
her
husband
from
springing
from
the
bed
and
going
out
upon
the
stairs
mr
rowland
was
already
up
looking
almost
beside
himself
with
grief
you
must
excuse
me
mr
hope
you
must
not
judge
me
hardly
if
you
are
ill
i
am
sorry
sir
but
sir
my
child
is
dying
we
fear
she
is
dying
sir
and
you
must
come
and
see
if
anything
can
save
her
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
going
on
as
we
have
been
doing
she
has
been
sacrificed
fairly
sacrificed
i
fear
nay
mr
rowland
i
must
comfort
you
there
said
hope
as
they
walked
rapidly
along
the
street
i
have
had
occasion
to
see
a
great
deal
of
mr
walcot
and
his
professional
conduct
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
i
am
certain
that
he
has
a
very
competent
knowledge
of
his
business
i
assure
you
he
shows
more
talent
more
power
altogether
in
his
professional
than
his
unprofessional
conduct
and
in
this
particular
disease
he
has
now
had
much
experience
god
bless
you
for
saying
so
my
dear
sir
it
is
like
you
always
generous
always
just
and
kind
you
must
forgive
us
mr
hope
at
a
time
like
this
you
must
overlook
all
causes
of
offence
they
are
very
great
i
know
but
you
will
not
visit
them
upon
us
now
we
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
now
said
hope
not
a
word
about
the
past
i
entreat
you
mrs
rowland
reckless
of
everything
but
her
child
was
standing
out
on
the
steps
watching
as
for
the
last
hope
for
her
matilda
she
is
much
worse
mr
hope
suddenly
and
alarmingly
worse
this
way
follow
me
hope
would
speak
with
mr
walcot
first
as
he
entered
the
study
to
await
mr
walcot
philip
passed
out
they
did
not
speak
oh
philip
speak
to
mr
hope
cried
mrs
rowland
for
god
sake
do
not
do
anything
to
offend
him
now
i
will
do
everything
in
my
power
madam
to
save
your
child
said
hope
do
not
fear
that
the
conduct
of
her
relations
will
be
allowed
to
injure
her
my
love
said
mr
rowland
mr
hope
came
from
a
sick
bed
to
help
us
do
not
distrust
him
indeed
he
deserves
better
from
us
pray
forgive
me
said
the
miserable
mother
i
do
not
well
know
what
i
am
saying
but
i
will
atone
for
all
if
you
save
my
child
priscilla
cried
her
brother
from
the
doorway
against
which
he
was
leaning
his
tone
of
wonder
was
lost
as
walcot
entered
and
the
study
was
left
for
the
conference
of
the
medical
men
as
the
gentlemen
went
upstairs
to
matilda
room
they
saw
one
child
here
and
another
there
peeping
about
in
silence
and
dismay
as
hope
put
his
hand
on
the
head
of
one
in
passing
mr
rowland
said
there
is
a
carriage
coming
for
them
presently
to
take
them
away
anna
and
george
are
now
with
miss
young
and
she
will
take
them
all
away
she
is
very
good
but
i
knew
we
might
depend
upon
her
upon
her
heart
and
her
forgiveness
ah
you
hear
the
poor
child
voice
that
shows
you
the
way
matilda
was
wandering
and
for
the
moment
talking
very
loud
something
about
grandmamma
seeing
her
dance
and
when
i
am
married
struck
the
ear
as
hope
entered
her
chamber
and
entirely
overset
the
mother
matilda
was
soon
in
a
stupor
again
it
was
impossible
to
hold
out
much
prospect
of
her
recovery
it
was
painful
to
every
one
to
hear
how
mrs
rowland
attempted
to
bribe
mr
hope
by
promises
of
doing
him
justice
to
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
in
matilda
behalf
he
turned
away
from
her
again
and
again
with
a
disgust
which
his
compassion
could
scarcely
restrain
philip
was
so
far
roused
by
the
few
words
which
had
been
let
drop
as
to
choose
to
hear
what
passed
now
in
the
antechamber
to
the
room
it
was
he
who
decidedly
interposed
at
last
he
sent
his
to
matilda
bedside
dismissed
mr
walcot
from
the
room
and
then
said
a
very
few
minutes
will
suffice
i
believe
sister
to
relieve
your
mind
and
they
will
be
well
spent
tell
us
what
you
mean
by
what
you
have
been
saying
so
often
within
this
quarter
of
an
hour
as
you
hope
in
heaven
as
you
dare
to
ask
god
to
spare
your
child
tell
us
the
extent
to
which
you
feel
that
you
have
injured
mr
hope
hope
sank
down
into
the
by
which
he
had
been
standing
he
thought
the
whole
story
of
his
love
was
now
coming
out
he
waited
for
the
first
words
as
for
a
thunderclap
the
first
words
were
oh
philip
i
am
the
most
wretched
woman
living
i
never
saw
it
so
strongly
before
i
believe
i
did
it
with
an
idea
of
good
to
you
but
i
burned
a
letter
of
margaret
to
you
what
letter
when
the
day
you
left
us
last
the
day
you
were
in
the
shrubbery
all
the
morning
the
day
the
children
found
the
shavings
burnt
what
was
in
the
letter
did
you
read
it
no
i
dared
not
what
made
you
burn
it
i
was
afraid
you
would
go
to
her
and
that
your
engagement
would
come
on
again
then
what
you
told
me
what
made
me
break
it
off
could
not
have
been
true
no
it
was
not
not
all
true
what
was
true
and
what
was
not
mrs
rowland
did
not
answer
but
looked
timidly
at
mr
hope
now
was
the
moment
for
him
to
speak
it
was
true
said
he
that
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
acquaintance
with
hester
and
margaret
i
preferred
margaret
and
that
my
family
discerned
that
i
did
as
true
as
that
hester
has
long
been
the
beloved
of
my
heart
beloved
as
but
i
can
not
speak
of
my
wife
of
my
home
in
the
hearing
of
one
who
has
endeavoured
to
profane
both
all
i
need
say
is
that
neither
hester
nor
margaret
ever
knew
where
my
first
transient
fancy
lighted
while
they
both
know
know
as
they
know
their
own
hearts
where
it
has
fixed
it
is
not
true
that
margaret
ever
loved
any
one
but
you
enderby
and
mrs
rowland
can
not
truly
say
that
she
ever
did
what
was
it
then
that
margaret
confided
to
my
mother
asked
enderby
turning
to
his
sister
i
can
not
tell
what
possessed
me
at
the
time
to
say
so
but
that
i
thought
i
was
doing
the
best
for
your
happiness
but
but
philip
i
really
believe
now
that
margaret
never
did
love
any
one
but
you
i
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
but
my
mother
she
knew
very
little
of
any
troubles
in
mr
hope
family
and
and
what
she
did
hear
was
all
from
me
do
you
mean
that
all
you
told
me
of
margaret
confidences
to
my
mother
was
false
there
was
no
answer
but
mrs
rowland
pale
cheeks
grew
paler
oh
god
what
can
margaret
have
thought
of
me
all
this
time
cried
philip
i
can
tell
you
what
she
has
thought
i
believe
said
hope
her
brother
and
sister
have
read
her
innocent
mind
as
you
yourself
might
have
done
if
your
faith
in
her
had
been
what
she
deserved
she
has
believed
that
you
loved
her
and
that
you
love
her
still
she
has
believed
that
some
one
that
mrs
rowland
traduced
her
to
you
and
in
her
generosity
she
blames
you
for
nothing
but
that
you
would
not
see
and
hear
her
that
you
went
away
on
the
receipt
of
her
letter
of
that
letter
which
it
now
appears
you
never
saw
where
is
she
cried
enderby
striding
to
the
door
she
is
not
at
home
you
can
not
find
her
at
this
moment
and
if
you
could
you
must
hear
me
first
you
remember
the
caution
i
gave
you
when
we
last
conversed
in
the
abbey
and
again
in
the
meadows
i
do
and
i
will
observe
it
now
you
remember
that
she
is
unaware
that
you
ever
that
that
interview
with
mrs
grey
ever
took
place
she
shall
never
learn
it
from
me
it
is
one
of
those
facts
which
have
ceased
to
exist
which
is
absolutely
dead
and
should
be
buried
in
oblivion
you
hear
priscilla
she
bowed
her
head
you
believe
that
say
no
more
brother
do
not
humble
me
further
i
will
make
what
reparation
i
can
indeed
i
will
and
then
perhaps
god
will
spare
my
child
hope
passing
reflection
was
how
alike
is
the
superstition
of
the
ignorant
and
of
the
wicked
my
poor
neighbours
stealing
to
the
conjuror
tent
in
the
lane
and
this
wretched
lady
hope
alike
to
bribe
heaven
in
their
extremity
they
by
gifts
and
rites
she
by
remorse
and
how
different
from
the
faith
which
say
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
where
margaret
will
you
tell
me
asked
enderby
impatiently
but
before
i
see
her
i
ought
to
ask
forgiveness
from
you
hope
you
find
how
cruelly
i
have
been
deceived
by
what
incredible
falsehood
but
glancing
at
his
pale
sister
we
will
speak
no
more
of
that
if
in
the
midst
of
all
this
error
and
wretchedness
i
have
hurt
your
feelings
more
than
my
false
persuasions
rendered
necessary
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
and
me
will
you
forgive
me
asked
mrs
rowland
faintly
there
is
nothing
to
pardon
in
you
said
hope
to
philip
your
belief
in
what
your
own
sister
told
you
in
so
much
detail
can
scarcely
be
called
a
weakness
and
you
did
and
said
nothing
to
me
that
was
not
warranted
by
what
you
and
i
forgive
you
madam
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
relieve
your
present
affliction
and
as
long
as
you
attempt
no
further
injustice
towards
my
family
no
words
shall
be
spoken
by
any
of
us
to
remind
you
of
what
is
past
you
are
very
good
mr
hope
i
tell
you
plainly
he
resumed
that
you
can
not
injure
us
beyond
a
certain
point
you
can
not
make
it
goodness
in
us
to
forget
what
is
past
it
is
of
far
less
consequence
to
us
what
you
and
others
think
of
us
than
what
we
think
of
our
neighbours
our
chief
sorrow
has
been
the
spectacle
of
yourself
in
your
dealings
with
us
we
shall
be
thankful
to
be
reminded
of
it
no
more
and
now
enough
of
this
where
margaret
again
asked
enderby
as
if
in
despair
of
an
answer
she
is
nursing
mrs
howell
as
soon
as
i
have
seen
this
poor
child
again
i
will
go
home
and
take
care
that
margaret
is
prepared
to
see
you
remember
how
great
the
surprise
the
mystery
must
be
to
her
if
the
surprise
were
all
said
but
will
she
hear
me
will
she
forgive
me
will
she
trust
me
was
there
ever
a
woman
who
really
loved
who
would
not
hear
would
not
forgive
would
not
trust
said
hope
smiling
i
must
not
answer
for
margaret
but
i
think
i
may
answer
for
woman
in
the
abstract
i
will
follow
you
in
an
hour
hope
do
so
now
madam
and
hope
followed
mrs
rowland
again
to
the
bedside
of
her
dying
child
chapter
forty
five
rest
of
the
placable
margaret
was
not
at
mrs
howell
at
the
moment
that
her
brother
believed
and
said
she
was
she
had
been
there
just
in
time
to
witness
the
poor
woman
departure
and
she
was
soon
home
again
and
relating
the
circumstances
to
hester
by
the
fireside
even
the
news
that
edward
was
now
in
the
same
house
with
philip
could
not
efface
from
her
mind
what
she
had
seen
nor
could
hester
help
listening
though
full
of
anxiety
about
her
husband
miss
miskin
was
prevailed
upon
to
leave
her
room
at
the
last
i
suppose
scarcely
poor
nanny
was
supporting
her
mistress
head
when
i
went
in
and
she
said
with
tears
that
there
was
no
depending
on
any
one
but
us
they
both
looked
glad
enough
to
see
me
but
then
nothing
would
satisfy
mrs
howell
but
that
i
should
warm
myself
and
be
seated
to
the
last
and
she
offered
you
some
i
suppose
yes
just
as
usual
then
she
told
me
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
mention
now
in
case
she
should
grow
worse
and
be
in
any
danger
that
she
should
be
gratified
if
you
and
i
would
select
each
a
rug
or
screen
pattern
from
her
stock
and
worsteds
to
work
it
with
and
she
gave
a
broad
hint
that
there
was
one
with
a
mausoleum
and
two
weeping
willows
which
she
hoped
one
of
us
would
choose
and
that
perhaps
her
name
might
fill
up
the
space
on
the
tomb
poor
nanny
began
to
cry
and
this
affected
mrs
howell
and
she
begged
earnestly
to
see
miss
miskin
and
then
she
came
i
suppose
not
she
she
would
not
come
till
her
friend
sent
a
message
threatening
to
haunt
her
if
she
did
not
did
you
carry
the
message
no
but
nanny
did
and
i
thought
with
hearty
good
will
miss
miskin
came
trembling
but
too
much
frightened
to
cry
she
would
not
approach
nearer
than
the
doorway
and
there
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
so
remained
the
whole
time
she
was
receiving
directions
about
the
shop
and
the
stock
case
as
the
poor
soul
again
said
my
getting
worse
so
as
to
be
in
any
danger
and
yet
dr
levitt
thought
he
had
told
her
plainly
enough
what
he
thought
of
her
state
this
morning
and
was
she
aware
at
last
or
did
she
go
off
unconsciously
i
think
she
was
aware
i
think
so
from
her
last
words
my
poor
dear
howell
i
sat
behind
the
curtain
while
she
was
speaking
to
miss
miskin
sometimes
so
faintly
that
nanny
had
to
repeat
her
words
to
make
them
heard
as
far
as
the
door
that
selfish
wretch
miss
miskin
it
was
very
moving
i
assure
you
to
hear
not
one
word
of
reproach
or
even
notice
of
miss
miskin
desertion
in
this
illness
what
was
said
was
enough
but
every
word
was
kind
i
have
it
all
i
took
it
down
with
my
pencil
behind
the
curtain
for
i
was
sure
miss
miskin
would
never
remember
it
mrs
howell
went
on
till
she
came
to
directions
about
the
bullfinch
that
her
poor
dear
howell
used
to
laugh
to
see
perched
upon
her
nightcap
of
a
morning
and
then
she
grew
unintelligible
i
thought
she
was
only
fainting
but
while
we
were
trying
to
revive
her
nanny
said
she
was
going
miss
miskin
drew
back
into
the
passage
shut
the
door
and
made
her
escape
her
friend
looked
that
way
once
more
and
said
that
we
had
all
been
very
good
to
her
she
mentioned
her
husband
as
i
told
you
and
then
died
very
quietly
miss
miskin
knows
of
course
i
told
her
and
did
not
pretend
to
feel
much
sympathy
in
her
lamentations
i
told
her
she
had
lost
a
friend
who
would
have
watched
over
her
i
believed
till
her
last
breath
if
she
had
been
the
one
attacked
by
the
fever
what
did
she
say
she
exclaimed
a
great
deal
about
how
good
we
all
were
and
wondered
what
deerbrook
would
have
done
without
us
and
said
she
was
sure
i
was
too
kind
to
think
of
leaving
her
in
the
house
with
the
corpse
with
only
nanny
when
i
declined
passing
the
night
there
she
comforted
herself
with
thinking
aloud
that
her
friend
would
not
haunt
her
certainly
would
not
haunt
her
as
she
gone
to
her
room
at
last
her
final
question
was
how
soon
i
thought
it
likely
that
she
should
feel
the
fever
coming
on
in
case
of
her
having
caught
it
after
all
by
going
into
the
room
what
an
end
to
a
sentimental
friendship
of
so
many
years
i
rather
expect
to
hear
in
the
morning
that
she
has
taken
refuge
in
some
neighbour
house
and
left
nanny
alone
with
the
corpse
my
husband
knock
cried
hester
starting
up
how
is
your
headache
love
asked
she
anxiously
as
she
met
him
at
the
room
door
gone
quite
gone
he
replied
i
must
step
down
into
the
surgery
for
a
minute
about
this
poor
little
girl
medicine
and
then
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
the
sisters
sat
in
perfect
silence
till
his
return
matilda
said
margaret
looking
up
at
her
brother
she
is
very
ill
not
likely
to
be
better
and
poor
mrs
howell
is
gone
said
hester
what
a
sweep
it
is
did
you
hear
love
mrs
howell
is
dead
i
hear
it
is
a
terrible
destruction
that
we
have
witnessed
but
i
trust
it
is
nearly
over
i
know
of
only
one
or
two
cases
of
danger
now
besides
this
little
girl
poor
matilda
but
we
have
little
thought
to
spare
even
for
her
if
i
did
not
know
that
margaret
is
ready
for
whatever
may
betide
he
continued
fixing
his
benevolent
gaze
upon
her
and
if
moreover
i
were
not
afraid
that
some
one
would
be
coming
to
tell
my
news
if
i
do
not
get
it
out
at
once
i
should
hesitate
about
saying
what
i
have
to
say
philip
has
been
explaining
he
is
coming
said
margaret
with
such
calmness
as
she
could
command
enderby
is
coming
and
some
one
else
whose
explanations
are
more
to
the
purpose
has
been
explaining
mrs
rowland
alarmed
and
shaken
by
her
misery
has
been
acknowledging
the
whole
series
of
falsehoods
by
which
she
persuaded
convinced
her
brother
that
you
did
not
love
him
that
you
were
in
fact
attached
elsewhere
i
see
how
angry
you
are
hester
i
see
you
asking
in
your
own
mind
how
enderby
could
be
thus
deluded
how
he
could
trust
his
sister
rather
than
margaret
how
i
can
speak
of
him
as
deserving
to
have
her
after
all
this
your
questions
are
reasonable
enough
love
and
yet
they
can
not
be
answered
your
doubts
of
enderby
are
reasonable
enough
and
yet
i
declare
to
you
that
he
is
in
my
eyes
almost
if
not
quite
blameless
thank
you
brother
said
margaret
looking
up
with
swimming
eyes
there
is
one
great
point
to
be
settled
resumed
hope
and
that
is
whether
you
will
both
be
content
to
bury
in
silence
the
subject
of
this
quarrel
from
this
hour
relying
upon
my
testimony
and
mrs
rowland
oh
edward
do
not
put
your
name
and
hers
together
for
enderby
justification
and
for
margaret
sake
my
name
shall
be
joined
with
the
if
necessary
my
love
you
must
as
i
was
saying
rely
upon
the
testimony
of
those
who
know
the
whole
that
enderby
conduct
throughout
has
been
if
not
the
very
wisest
and
best
perfectly
natural
and
consistent
with
the
love
for
margaret
which
he
has
cherished
to
this
hour
i
knew
it
murmured
margaret
he
will
himself
disclose
as
much
as
he
thinks
proper
when
he
comes
but
he
comes
full
of
fear
and
doubt
about
his
reception
margaret
hung
her
head
feeling
that
it
was
well
she
was
reminded
what
reason
there
was
for
his
coming
with
doubt
and
trembling
in
his
heart
as
he
comes
full
of
fear
and
doubt
resumed
hope
i
must
tell
you
first
that
he
never
received
your
last
letter
margaret
he
thought
you
would
not
answer
his
he
thought
you
took
him
at
his
word
about
not
attempting
explanation
what
an
unhappy
accident
cried
hester
who
carried
that
letter
how
did
it
happen
it
was
no
accident
my
dear
mrs
rowland
burned
that
letter
margaret
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
suddenly
looking
up
she
cried
did
she
read
it
no
she
says
she
dared
not
why
margaret
you
seem
sorry
that
she
did
not
you
think
it
would
have
cleared
you
i
have
no
doubt
she
thought
so
too
and
that
that
was
the
reason
why
she
averted
her
eyes
from
it
yes
it
was
a
cruel
injury
margaret
can
you
forgive
it
do
you
think
not
said
hester
do
not
ask
it
of
her
i
believe
i
may
ask
it
at
this
very
moment
the
happy
can
forgive
is
it
not
so
margaret
for
myself
i
could
and
i
do
brother
i
would
go
now
and
nurse
her
child
and
comfort
her
but
but
you
can
not
forgive
the
wretchedness
she
has
caused
to
philip
well
if
you
each
forgive
her
for
your
own
part
there
is
a
chance
that
she
may
yet
lift
up
her
humbled
head
what
possessed
her
to
hate
us
so
said
hester
her
hatred
to
us
is
the
result
of
long
habits
of
of
selfish
pride
and
of
low
pertinacity
about
small
objects
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
account
for
it
all
she
disliked
you
first
for
your
connection
with
the
greys
and
then
she
disliked
me
for
my
connection
with
you
she
nourished
up
all
her
personal
feelings
into
an
opposition
to
us
and
our
doings
and
when
she
had
done
this
and
found
her
own
only
brother
going
over
to
the
enemy
as
she
regarded
it
her
dislike
grew
into
a
passion
of
hatred
under
the
influence
of
this
passion
she
has
been
led
on
to
say
and
to
do
more
and
more
that
would
suit
her
purposes
till
she
has
found
herself
sunk
in
an
abyss
of
guilt
i
really
believe
she
was
not
fully
aware
of
her
situation
till
her
misery
of
revealed
it
to
her
poor
thing
said
margaret
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
to
help
her
we
will
ask
enderby
i
take
hers
to
be
no
uncommon
case
the
dislikes
of
low
and
selfish
minds
generally
bear
very
much
the
character
of
hers
though
they
may
not
be
pampered
by
circumstances
into
such
a
luxuriance
as
in
this
case
in
a
city
mrs
rowland
might
have
been
an
ordinary
spiteful
fine
lady
in
such
a
place
as
deerbrook
and
with
a
family
of
rivals
cousins
incessantly
before
her
eyes
to
exercise
her
passions
upon
she
has
ended
in
being
what
she
is
said
margaret
as
hope
stopped
for
a
word
margaret
is
less
surprised
than
you
expected
is
she
not
said
hester
you
did
not
suppose
that
she
would
sit
and
listen
as
she
does
to
your
analysis
of
mrs
rowland
but
if
the
truth
were
known
she
carries
a
prophecy
about
her
on
her
finger
i
have
no
doubt
she
has
been
expecting
this
very
news
ever
since
she
recovered
her
ring
yes
or
no
margaret
i
should
rather
say
she
has
carried
a
prophecy
in
her
heart
all
these
long
months
said
hope
of
which
that
on
her
finger
is
only
the
symbol
however
it
may
be
said
hester
it
has
prepared
a
reception
for
mr
enderby
there
is
no
resisting
a
prophecy
what
is
written
is
written
i
must
hear
him
you
know
said
margaret
gently
you
must
and
you
must
hear
him
favourably
said
her
brother
i
had
forgotten
said
hester
ringing
the
bell
morris
a
good
fire
in
the
immediately
within
the
hour
philip
and
margaret
were
by
that
fireside
finally
wedded
in
heart
and
soul
it
was
astonishing
how
little
explanation
was
needed
when
margaret
had
once
been
told
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
her
letter
having
been
destroyed
that
she
was
declared
to
have
made
mrs
enderby
the
depository
of
her
confidence
about
a
prior
attachment
there
was
however
as
much
to
relate
as
there
was
little
to
explain
how
enderby
heart
burned
within
him
when
in
sporting
with
the
idea
of
a
prior
attachment
it
came
out
what
margaret
had
felt
at
the
moment
of
his
intrusion
upon
the
conference
with
hope
of
which
he
had
since
as
at
the
time
been
so
jealous
the
amusement
on
her
own
part
and
the
joy
on
hester
which
she
was
trying
to
conceal
by
her
downcast
looks
how
his
soul
melted
within
him
when
she
owned
her
momentary
regret
at
being
saved
from
under
the
ice
and
the
consolation
and
stimulus
she
had
derived
from
her
brother
expression
of
affection
for
her
on
the
spot
how
clear
how
true
a
refutation
were
these
revealings
of
the
imputations
that
had
been
cast
upon
her
and
how
strangely
had
the
facts
been
distorted
by
a
prejudiced
imagination
how
sweet
in
the
telling
was
the
story
of
the
ring
so
sad
in
the
experience
and
the
recountings
of
the
times
that
they
had
seen
each
other
of
late
philip
had
caught
more
glimpses
than
she
he
came
down
he
dared
not
say
to
watch
over
her
in
this
time
of
sickness
but
because
he
could
not
stay
away
when
he
heard
of
the
condition
of
deerbrook
but
for
this
sickness
would
they
have
met
should
they
ever
have
understood
each
other
again
this
was
a
speculation
on
which
they
could
not
dwell
it
led
them
too
near
the
verge
of
the
grave
which
was
yawning
for
matilda
mrs
rowland
would
have
been
relieved
but
the
relief
would
have
been
not
unmixed
with
humiliation
if
she
could
have
known
how
easily
she
was
let
off
in
this
long
conference
not
only
can
the
happy
easily
forgive
but
they
are
exceedingly
apt
to
forget
the
causes
and
the
history
of
their
woes
and
the
wretched
lady
who
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
and
terror
for
her
child
trembled
at
home
at
the
image
of
the
lovers
she
had
injured
was
to
those
lovers
in
their
happiness
much
as
if
she
had
never
existed
mrs
howell
said
margaret
hearing
her
sister
mention
their
departed
neighbour
after
philip
was
gone
is
it
possible
that
it
was
this
very
afternoon
that
i
saw
that
poor
woman
die
even
so
dear
how
many
days
or
months
or
years
have
you
lived
since
a
whole
age
of
bliss
margaret
margaret

said

chapter
forty
six
deerbrook
in
sunshine
on
the
first
news
of
the
fever
being
gone
the
greys
returned
to
deerbrook
and
dr
levitt
family
soon
followed
the
place
wore
a
strange
appearance
to
those
who
had
been
absent
for
some
time
large
patches
of
grass
overspread
the
main
street
and
cows
might
have
pastured
on
the
thatch
of
some
of
the
cottages
while
the
once
green
churchyard
looked
brown
and
bare
from
the
number
of
new
graves
crowded
in
among
the
old
ones
in
many
a
court
were
the
running
wild
over
the
weedy
borders
for
want
of
hands
to
tend
them
and
the
birds
built
in
many
a
chimney
from
which
the
blue
smoke
had
been
wont
to
rise
in
the
morning
air
sophia
and
her
sisters
noted
these
things
as
they
walked
through
the
place
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
while
their
father
was
engaged
in
inspecting
the
parish
register
to
learn
how
many
of
his
neighbours
were
gone
and
their
mother
was
paying
her
visit
of
condolence
to
mrs
rowland
fanny
and
mary
were
much
impressed
this
day
with
matilda
death
they
had
first
wondered
and
then
wept
when
they
heard
of
it
at
a
distance
and
now
when
once
more
on
the
spot
where
they
had
seen
her
daily
and
had
hourly
criticised
her
looks
her
sayings
and
doings
they
were
under
a
strong
sense
of
the
meanness
and
frivolity
of
their
talk
and
the
unkindness
of
their
feelings
about
one
whose
faults
could
hardly
be
called
her
own
and
who
might
now
they
supposed
be
living
and
moving
in
scenes
and
amidst
circumstances
whose
solemnity
and
importance
put
to
shame
the
petty
intercourse
they
had
carried
on
with
her
here
both
resolved
in
their
hearts
that
if
anna
rowland
should
praise
her
own
dancing
and
flatten
her
back
before
she
spoke
and
talk
often
of
the
time
when
she
should
be
married
they
would
let
it
all
pass
and
not
tell
mamma
or
sophia
or
exchange
satirical
looks
with
each
other
they
remembered
now
that
matilda
had
done
good
and
kind
things
which
had
been
disregarded
at
the
time
when
they
were
bent
on
ridiculing
her
it
was
just
hereabouts
that
she
took
off
her
worsted
gloves
one
bitter
day
in
the
winter
and
put
them
on
the
hands
of
her
little
brother
who
was
crying
with
cold
and
it
was
by
yonder
corner
that
she
directed
a
stranger
gentleman
into
the
right
road
so
prettily
that
he
looked
after
her
as
she
walked
away
and
said
she
would
be
the
pride
of
the
place
some
day
alas
there
she
lay
in
the
vault
under
the
church
and
she
would
be
no
one
pride
in
this
world
except
in
her
poor
heart
there
is
somebody
not
in
mourning
cried
fanny
the
very
first
besides
my
cousins
that
we
have
seen
oh
it
is
mrs
james
shall
we
not
speak
to
her
mrs
james
seemed
warmed
out
of
her
usual
indifference
she
shook
hands
almost
affectionately
with
sophia
the
meeting
of
acquaintances
who
find
themselves
alive
after
a
pestilence
is
unlike
any
other
kind
of
meeting
it
animates
the
most
indifferent
and
almost
makes
friends
of
enemies
while
mrs
james
and
sophia
were
making
mutual
inquiries
mary
called
fanny
attention
to
what
was
to
be
seen
opposite
there
was
a
glittering
row
of
large
letters
miskin
late
howell
haberdasher
etcetera
miss
miskin
in
the
deepest
mourning
with
a
countenance
trained
to
melancholy
was
peeping
through
the
ribbons
and
handkerchiefs
which
veiled
her
window
to
see
whether
the
miss
greys
were
on
their
way
to
her
or
not
sophia
would
not
have
been
able
to
resist
going
in
but
that
on
parting
from
mrs
james
she
saw
the
true
object
of
her
morning
walk
approaching
in
the
person
of
mr
walcot
her
intention
had
been
to
meet
him
in
his
rounds
and
here
he
was
if
mrs
james
had
been
almost
affectionate
what
was
mr
walcot
he
had
really
gone
through
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
and
suffering
lately
and
his
heart
was
very
soft
and
tender
just
now
he
turned
about
and
walked
with
sophia
walked
a
mile
out
into
the
country
by
her
side
and
neither
seemed
to
have
any
thought
of
turning
back
till
fanny
reminded
her
sister
how
long
mamma
would
have
been
kept
waiting
for
her
to
go
and
call
on
the
levitts
the
conversation
had
been
in
an
under
voice
all
the
way
out
and
back
but
when
the
parting
was
to
take
place
when
mr
walcot
was
to
leave
them
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
the
little
girls
heard
a
few
words
which
threw
some
light
on
what
had
been
passing
they
caught
from
sophia
i
must
consult
my
parents
and
as
they
hurried
homewards
with
her
they
ventured
to
cast
up
a
glance
of
droll
meaning
into
her
face
which
made
her
try
to
help
smiling
and
to
speak
sharply
and
then
they
knew
that
they
had
guessed
the
truth
mr
grey
made
his
call
upon
his
cousins
that
evening
he
requested
some
private
conversation
with
hope
his
objects
were
to
learn
opinion
of
mr
walcot
as
he
had
seen
him
of
late
under
very
trying
circumstances
and
if
this
opinion
should
be
sufficiently
favourable
to
warrant
the
proposition
to
open
the
subject
of
a
partnership
a
partnership
in
which
as
was
fair
mr
walcot
should
have
a
small
share
at
present
of
the
income
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
labour
which
was
all
that
the
young
man
under
the
effect
of
his
recent
terrors
and
of
his
veneration
for
mr
hope
wished
or
desired
he
had
declared
that
if
he
could
obtain
his
beloved
sophia
and
be
permitted
to
rely
on
mr
hope
as
his
partner
and
friend
he
should
be
the
happiest
man
alive
and
he
was
confident
that
his
parents
would
consider
him
a
most
fortunate
youth
to
be
received
at
his
outset
into
life
into
such
a
family
as
mr
grey
and
under
the
professional
guidance
of
such
a
practitioner
and
such
a
man
as
mr
hope
there
seemed
to
be
every
probability
of
his
becoming
the
happiest
man
alive
for
the
greys
were
clearly
well
disposed
towards
him
and
mr
hope
had
nothing
to
say
of
him
which
could
hurt
their
feelings
he
repeated
what
he
had
declared
to
mr
rowland
that
mr
walcot
energies
seemed
to
be
concentrated
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
and
that
his
professional
knowledge
appeared
to
be
sufficient
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
kindness
of
heart
and
though
it
could
not
be
expected
of
him
that
he
would
ever
make
a
striking
figure
in
the
world
yet
he
might
sustain
a
fair
portion
of
respectability
and
usefulness
in
a
country
station
as
to
the
partnership
no
difficulty
arose
mr
grey
frankly
explained
that
present
income
was
far
less
of
an
object
than
to
have
his
daughter
settled
beside
her
parents
and
his
usefully
and
honourably
occupied
sophia
would
have
enough
money
to
make
walcot
income
an
affair
of
inferior
consideration
if
he
should
deserve
an
increase
by
and
by
it
would
be
all
very
well
if
not
the
young
people
must
get
on
without
anything
was
better
than
sending
the
young
man
away
to
establish
himself
in
a
new
place
with
no
happier
prospects
to
family
than
that
of
parting
with
her
to
a
distance
at
last
it
did
not
require
many
days
to
complete
the
arrangements
hester
was
at
first
a
little
vexed
but
on
the
whole
much
more
amused
at
the
idea
of
her
husband
having
mr
walcot
for
a
partner
and
she
soon
saw
the
advantage
of
his
being
spared
many
a
long
country
ride
and
many
a
visit
at
inconvenient
seasons
by
his
junior
being
at
hand
she
made
no
substantial
objection
and
invited
mr
walcot
to
the
house
with
all
due
cordiality
the
young
man
gratitude
and
devotion
knew
no
bounds
and
the
only
trouble
hope
felt
in
the
business
was
the
awkwardness
of
checking
his
expressions
of
thankfulness
when
the
announcement
of
the
double
arrangement
was
to
be
made
mrs
grey
could
not
resist
going
herself
to
mrs
rowland
and
sophia
was
sorry
that
she
could
not
be
present
too
to
see
how
the
lady
would
receive
the
news
of
a
third
gentleman
marrying
into
the
connection
so
decidedly
but
mr
grey
took
care
to
enlighten
his
partner
on
the
matter
some
hours
before
so
that
mrs
rowland
was
prepared
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
very
apathetic
that
she
had
no
feelings
left
for
the
affairs
of
life
that
her
interests
were
all
buried
in
the
tomb
of
her
own
matilda
mrs
grey
had
therefore
nothing
in
particular
to
tell
sophia
when
she
returned
from
paying
the
visit
in
exchange
for
the
news
sir
william
and
lady
hunter
sent
back
their
congratulations
and
a
very
gracious
and
extensive
invitation
to
dinner
finding
that
mrs
rowland
brother
was
really
with
the
approbation
of
his
family
going
to
marry
mrs
hope
sister
and
that
mrs
was
entering
into
partnership
with
mr
hope
himself
they
thought
it
the
right
time
to
give
their
sanction
to
the
reconciliations
which
were
taking
place
by
being
civil
to
all
the
parties
round
so
lady
hunter
came
in
state
to
deerbrook
one
fine
day
made
all
due
apologies
and
invited
to
dinner
the
whole
connection
mrs
rowland
could
not
go
of
course
and
margaret
declined
but
all
the
rest
went
margaret
was
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
and
she
preferred
one
more
day
with
maria
to
a
visit
of
ceremony
she
begged
philip
to
go
as
his
sister
could
not
and
he
obeyed
with
a
good
grace
grudging
the
loss
of
a
sweet
spring
evening
over
sir
william
hunter
the
less
that
he
knew
margaret
and
maria
were
making
the
best
use
of
it
together
once
more
the
friends
sat
in
the
by
the
window
whence
they
loved
to
look
abroad
upon
meadow
wood
and
stream
here
they
had
studied
together
and
cherished
each
other
here
they
had
eagerly
imparted
a
multitude
of
thoughts
and
carefully
concealed
a
few
here
they
were
now
conversing
together
for
the
last
time
before
their
approaching
separation
maria
sighed
often
as
she
well
might
and
when
margaret
looked
abroad
upon
the
in
the
distant
field
and
listened
to
the
bleat
of
the
lambs
which
came
up
from
the
pastures
and
was
aware
of
the
scent
of
the
hyacinths
occasionally
wafted
in
from
poor
matilda
neighbouring
she
sighed
too
you
must
take
some
of
our
hyacinths
with
you
to
london
and
see
whether
they
will
not
blossom
there
said
maria
answering
to
her
thought
i
hardly
know
whether
there
would
be
most
pain
or
pleasure
in
seeing
plants
sprout
and
then
wither
in
the
little
balcony
of
a
back
which
overlooks
gables
or
stables
instead
of
these
delicious
green
meadows
how
fond
you
were
two
years
ago
of
imagining
the
bliss
of
living
always
in
sight
of
this
very
landscape
yet
it
has
yielded
already
to
the
back
with
a
prospect
of
stables
and
gables
we
shall
come
and
look
upon
your
woods
sometimes
you
know
i
am
not
bidding
to
this
place
or
to
you
god
forbid
now
tell
me
margaret
said
maria
after
a
pause
tell
me
when
you
are
to
be
married
that
is
what
i
was
just
about
to
do
we
go
on
tuesday
indeed
in
three
days
but
why
should
it
not
be
so
it
is
a
weary
time
since
you
promised
first
a
year
ago
there
were
reasons
as
philip
admits
now
why
i
could
not
leave
hester
and
edward
there
are
no
such
reasons
now
they
are
prosperous
their
days
of
struggle
when
they
wanted
me
my
head
my
hands
my
little
income
are
past
edward
practice
has
come
back
to
him
with
increase
for
mr
walcot
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
for
them
you
have
done
your
duty
by
them
now
duty
what
has
it
been
to
theirs
oh
maria
what
a
spectacle
has
that
been
when
i
think
how
they
have
evil
with
good
how
they
have
endured
how
forgiven
how
toiled
and
watched
on
their
enemies
behalf
till
they
have
ruled
all
the
minds
and
touched
all
the
hearts
of
friends
and
foes
for
miles
round
i
think
theirs
the
most
gracious
piece
of
tribulation
that
ever
befell
at
home
oh
even
you
do
not
know
what
a
home
it
is
nor
was
margaret
herself
aware
what
that
home
was
now
she
saw
how
edward
had
there
too
evil
with
good
how
he
had
permanently
established
hester
in
her
highest
moods
of
mind
strengthened
her
to
overcome
the
one
unhappy
tendency
from
which
she
had
suffered
through
the
whole
of
her
life
and
dispersed
all
storms
from
the
dwelling
wherein
his
child
was
to
grow
up
but
she
did
not
know
half
the
extent
of
his
victory
or
the
delight
of
its
rewards
she
knew
nothing
of
the
secret
shudder
with
which
he
looked
back
upon
the
entanglement
the
peril
the
suffering
he
had
gone
through
or
of
the
deep
peace
which
had
settled
down
upon
his
soul
now
that
the
struggle
was
well
past
she
little
imagined
how
when
all
the
world
regarded
him
as
an
old
married
man
his
was
now
in
truth
the
soul
of
the
lover
how
from
having
at
one
time
pitied
feared
recoiled
from
her
with
whom
he
had
connected
himself
for
life
he
had
risen
by
dint
of
a
religious
discharge
of
duty
towards
her
from
and
mere
compassion
to
patience
to
hope
to
interest
to
admiration
to
love
love
at
last
worthy
of
hers
love
which
satisfied
even
hester
imperious
affections
and
set
even
her
mind
and
heart
at
rest
little
did
margaret
imagine
all
this
there
was
but
one
beside
edward
himself
who
knew
it
and
that
one
was
morris
who
daily
thanked
god
that
strength
had
been
given
according
to
the
need
there
is
but
one
person
in
the
world
maria
said
her
friend
on
whose
account
i
can
not
help
being
anxious
i
was
faithless
about
hester
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
have
an
uneasy
thought
for
her
and
now
i
am
afraid
i
shall
sin
in
the
same
way
about
you
and
why
should
you
margaret
if
i
were
without
object
without
hope
without
experience
without
the
power
of
which
such
experience
gives
you
might
well
fear
for
me
but
why
now
it
is
not
reasonable
towards
the
providence
under
which
we
live
it
is
not
just
to
me
that
is
very
true
but
though
it
is
not
too
much
for
your
faith
that
you
are
infirm
and
suffering
in
body
poor
solitary
living
by
toil
without
love
without
prospect
though
all
this
may
not
be
too
much
for
your
faith
maria
i
own
it
is
at
times
for
mine
of
all
these
evils
there
is
but
one
which
is
very
hard
to
bear
i
solitary
and
the
suffering
from
the
sense
of
this
is
great
but
what
has
been
borne
may
be
borne
and
this
evil
is
precisely
that
which
has
been
the
peculiar
trial
of
the
greatest
and
best
of
their
race
or
of
those
who
have
been
recognised
as
such
you
will
not
suppose
that
i
try
to
flatter
my
pride
with
this
thought
or
that
the
most
insane
pride
could
be
a
support
under
this
kind
of
suffering
i
mean
only
that
there
can
be
nothing
morally
fatal
in
a
trial
which
many
of
the
wisest
and
best
have
sustained
but
it
is
painful
very
painful
for
the
mere
pain
let
it
pass
and
for
the
other
of
my
lot
let
us
not
dare
to
speak
evil
of
them
lest
we
should
be
slandering
my
best
friends
if
infirmity
toil
poverty
and
the
foibles
of
people
about
us
all
go
to
fortify
us
in
god
forbid
that
we
should
quarrel
with
them
but
are
you
sure
quite
sure
that
you
can
stand
the
discipline
that
your
nerves
as
well
as
your
soul
can
endure
far
from
sure
but
my
peril
is
less
than
it
was
and
i
have
therefore
every
hope
of
victory
at
last
in
my
wilderness
some
tempter
or
another
comes
at
times
when
my
heart
is
hungry
and
my
faith
is
fainting
and
shows
me
such
a
lot
as
yours
all
the
sunny
kingdoms
of
love
and
hope
given
into
your
hand
and
then
the
desert
of
my
lot
looks
dreary
enough
for
the
moment
but
then
arises
the
very
reasonable
question
why
we
should
demand
that
one
lot
should
in
this
exceedingly
small
section
of
our
immortality
be
as
happy
as
another
why
we
can
not
each
husband
our
own
life
and
means
without
wanting
to
be
all
equal
let
us
bless
heaven
for
your
lot
by
all
means
but
why
in
the
name
of
providence
should
mine
be
like
it
nay
margaret
why
these
tears
for
their
sake
i
will
tell
you
and
then
we
shall
have
talked
quite
enough
about
me
that
you
are
no
fair
judge
of
my
lot
you
see
me
often
generally
in
the
midst
of
annoyance
and
you
do
not
because
no
one
can
look
with
the
eye
of
my
mind
upon
the
future
if
you
could
for
one
day
and
night
feel
with
my
feelings
and
see
through
my
eyes
oh
that
i
could
i
should
be
the
holier
for
ever
after
nay
nay
but
if
you
could
do
this
you
would
know
from
henceforth
that
there
are
glimpses
of
heaven
for
me
in
solitude
as
for
you
in
love
and
that
it
is
almost
as
good
to
look
forward
without
fear
of
chance
or
change
as
with
such
a
flutter
of
hope
as
is
stirring
in
you
now
so
much
for
the
solitaries
of
the
earth
and
because
providence
should
be
justified
of
his
children
now
when
is
this
family
meeting
to
take
place
in
the
frank
hopes
to
land
in
august
and
anne
mrs
gilchrist
will
meet
him
as
soon
as
she
can
hear
in
her
of
the
world
of
his
arrival
the
other
sister
is
still
abroad
and
can
not
come
i
hope
anne
may
be
a
friend
to
you
an
intimate
judging
by
her
brothers
and
her
own
letters
i
think
she
must
be
worthy
thank
you
but
you
are
and
ever
will
be
my
intimate
there
can
be
no
other
we
shall
be
often
seeing
you
here
sometimes
and
we
shall
have
you
with
us
no
i
can
not
come
to
london
i
shall
never
leave
this
place
again
i
believe
but
you
will
be
often
coming
to
it
when
that
crowd
of
new
graves
in
the
churchyard
shall
be
waving
with
grass
and
those
old
woods
looking
more
ancient
still
and
the
grown
people
of
deerbrook
telling
their
little
ones
all
about
the
pestilence
that
swept
the
place
at
the
end
of
the
great
scarcity
when
were
children
you
and
yours
and
perhaps
i
may
sit
a
knot
of
friends
and
hear
over
again
about
those
good
old
days
of
ours
as
we
shall
then
call
them
and
tell
how
there
was
an
aged
man
who
told
us
of
his
seeing
the
deer
come
down
through
the
forest
to
drink
at
the
brook
i
should
like
to
behold
those
future
days
and
to
remember
whose
face
you
saw
in
the
torchlight
at
the
time
and
place
of
your
hearing
the
old
man
tale
whose
horse
do
i
hear
stopping
at
the
stable
it
is
philip
he
has
galloped
home
before
the
rest
said
margaret
drawing
back
from
the
window
with
the
smile
still
upon
her
face
now
maria
before
any
one
comes
tell
me
would
you
like
to
be
with
me
on
tuesday
morning
or
not
do
as
you
like
i
will
come
to
be
sure
said
maria
smiling
and
now
while
there
is
any
twilight
left
go
and
give
mr
enderby
the
walk
in
the
shrubbery
that
he
galloped
home
for
margaret
kept
philip
waiting
while
she
lighted
her
friend
lamp
and
its
gleam
shone
from
the
window
of
the
for
long
while
talking
of
maria
the
lovers
paced
the
shrubbery
and
let
the
twilight
go
