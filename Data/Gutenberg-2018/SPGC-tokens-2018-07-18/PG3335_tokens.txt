foreword
naturally
there
are
chapters
of
my
autobiography
which
can
not
now
be
written
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
nation
as
for
the
individual
what
is
most
important
is
to
insist
on
the
vital
need
of
combining
certain
sets
of
qualities
which
separately
are
common
enough
and
alas
useless
enough
practical
efficiency
is
common
and
lofty
idealism
not
uncommon
it
is
the
combination
which
is
necessary
and
the
combination
is
rare
love
of
peace
is
common
among
weak
timid
and
lazy
persons
and
on
the
other
hand
courage
is
found
among
many
men
of
evil
temper
and
bad
character
neither
quality
shall
by
itself
avail
justice
among
the
nations
of
mankind
and
the
uplifting
of
humanity
can
be
brought
about
only
by
those
strong
and
daring
men
who
with
wisdom
love
peace
but
who
love
righteousness
more
than
peace
facing
the
immense
complexity
of
modern
social
and
industrial
conditions
there
is
need
to
use
freely
and
unhesitatingly
the
collective
power
of
all
of
us
and
yet
no
exercise
of
collective
power
will
ever
avail
if
the
average
individual
does
not
keep
his
or
her
sense
of
personal
duty
initiative
and
responsibility
there
is
need
to
develop
all
the
virtues
that
have
the
state
for
their
sphere
of
action
but
these
virtues
are
as
dust
in
a
windy
street
unless
back
of
them
lie
the
strong
and
tender
virtues
of
a
family
life
based
on
the
love
of
the
one
man
for
the
one
woman
and
on
their
joyous
and
fearless
acceptance
of
their
common
obligation
to
the
children
that
are
theirs
there
must
be
the
keenest
sense
of
duty
and
with
it
must
go
the
joy
of
living
there
must
be
shame
at
the
thought
of
shirking
the
hard
work
of
the
world
and
at
the
same
time
delight
in
the
beauty
of
life
with
soul
of
flame
and
temper
of
steel
we
must
act
as
our
coolest
judgment
bids
us
we
must
exercise
the
largest
charity
towards
the
that
is
compatible
with
relentless
war
against
the
we
must
be
just
to
others
generous
to
others
and
yet
we
must
realize
that
it
is
a
shameful
and
a
wicked
thing
not
to
withstand
oppression
with
high
heart
and
ready
hand
with
gentleness
and
tenderness
there
must
go
dauntless
bravery
and
grim
acceptance
of
labor
and
hardship
and
peril
all
for
each
and
each
for
all
is
a
good
motto
but
only
on
condition
that
each
works
with
might
and
main
to
so
maintain
himself
as
not
to
be
a
burden
to
others
we
of
the
great
modern
democracies
must
strive
unceasingly
to
make
our
several
countries
lands
in
which
a
poor
man
who
works
hard
can
live
comfortably
and
honestly
and
in
which
a
rich
man
can
not
live
dishonestly
nor
in
slothful
avoidance
of
duty
and
yet
we
must
judge
rich
man
and
poor
man
alike
by
a
standard
which
rests
on
conduct
and
not
on
caste
and
we
must
frown
with
the
same
stern
severity
on
the
mean
and
vicious
envy
which
hates
and
would
plunder
a
man
because
he
is
well
off
and
on
the
brutal
and
selfish
arrogance
which
looks
down
on
and
exploits
the
man
with
whom
life
has
gone
hard

chapter
i
boyhood
and
youth
my
grandfather
on
my
father
side
was
of
almost
purely
dutch
blood
when
he
was
young
he
still
spoke
some
dutch
and
dutch
was
last
used
in
the
services
of
the
dutch
reformed
church
in
new
york
while
he
was
a
small
boy
about
his
ancestor
klaes
martensen
van
roosevelt
came
to
new
amsterdam
as
a
settler
the
euphemistic
name
for
an
immigrant
who
came
over
in
the
steerage
of
a
sailing
ship
in
the
seventeenth
century
instead
of
the
steerage
of
a
steamer
in
the
nineteenth
century
from
that
time
for
the
next
seven
generations
from
father
to
son
every
one
of
us
was
born
on
manhattan
island
my
father
paternal
ancestors
were
of
holland
stock
except
that
there
was
one
named
waldron
a
wheelwright
who
was
one
of
the
pilgrims
who
remained
in
holland
when
the
others
came
over
to
found
massachusetts
and
who
then
accompanied
the
dutch
adventurers
to
new
amsterdam
my
father
mother
was
a
pennsylvanian
her
forebears
had
come
to
pennsylvania
with
william
penn
some
in
the
same
ship
with
him
they
were
of
the
usual
type
of
the
immigration
of
that
particular
place
and
time
they
included
welsh
and
english
quakers
an
irishman
with
a
celtic
name
and
apparently
not
a
quaker
and
germans
who
were
among
the
founders
of
germantown
having
been
driven
from
their
rhineland
homes
when
the
armies
of
louis
the
fourteenth
ravaged
the
palatinate
and
in
addition
representatives
of
a
altogether
peaceful
people
the
scotch
irish
who
came
to
pennsylvania
a
little
later
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
my
grandmother
was
a
woman
of
singular
sweetness
and
strength
the
keystone
of
the
arch
in
her
relations
with
her
husband
and
sons
although
she
was
not
herself
dutch
it
was
she
who
taught
me
the
only
dutch
i
ever
knew
a
baby
song
of
which
the
first
line
ran
trippe
troppa
tronjes
i
always
remembered
this
and
when
i
was
in
east
africa
it
proved
a
bond
of
union
between
me
and
the
boer
settlers
not
a
few
of
whom
knew
it
although
at
first
they
always
had
difficulty
in
understanding
my
pronunciation
at
which
i
do
not
wonder
it
was
interesting
to
meet
these
men
whose
ancestors
had
gone
to
the
cape
about
the
time
that
mine
went
to
america
two
centuries
and
a
half
previously
and
to
find
that
the
descendants
of
the
two
streams
of
emigrants
still
crooned
to
their
children
some
at
least
of
the
same
nursery
songs
of
my
roosevelt
and
his
family
life
a
century
and
over
ago
i
know
little
beyond
what
is
implied
in
some
of
his
books
that
have
come
down
to
me
the
letters
of
junius
a
biography
of
john
paul
jones
chief
justice
marshall
life
of
washington
they
seem
to
indicate
that
his
library
was
less
interesting
than
that
of
my
at
the
same
time
which
certainly
included
such
volumes
as
the
original
for
we
have
them
now
on
our
own
of
my
grandfather
roosevelt
my
most
vivid
childish
reminiscence
is
not
something
i
saw
but
a
tale
that
was
told
me
concerning
him
in
boyhood
sunday
was
as
dismal
a
day
for
small
calvinistic
children
of
dutch
descent
as
if
they
had
been
of
puritan
or
scotch
covenanting
or
french
huguenot
descent
and
i
speak
as
one
proud
of
his
holland
huguenot
and
covenanting
ancestors
and
proud
that
the
blood
of
that
stark
puritan
divine
jonathan
edwards
flows
in
the
veins
of
his
children
one
summer
afternoon
after
listening
to
an
unusually
long
dutch
reformed
sermon
for
the
second
time
that
day
my
grandfather
a
small
boy
running
home
before
the
congregation
had
dispersed
ran
into
a
party
of
pigs
which
then
wandered
free
in
new
york
streets
he
promptly
mounted
a
big
boar
which
no
less
promptly
bolted
and
carried
him
at
full
speed
through
the
midst
of
the
outraged
congregation
by
the
way
one
of
the
roosevelt
documents
which
came
down
to
me
illustrates
the
change
that
has
come
over
certain
aspects
of
public
life
since
the
time
which
pessimists
term
the
earlier
and
better
days
of
the
republic
old
isaac
roosevelt
was
a
member
of
an
auditing
committee
which
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
revolution
approved
the
following
bill
the
state
of
new
york
to
john

and
the
president
of
the
united
states
falstaff
views
of
the
proper
proportion
between
sack
and
bread
are
borne
out
by
the
proportion
between
the
number
of
bowls
of
punch
and
bottles
of
port
madeira
and
beer
consumed
and
the
coffee
for
eight
gentlemen
apparently
the
only
ones
who
lasted
through
to
that
stage
of
the
dinner
especially
admirable
is
the
nonchalant
manner
in
which
obviously
as
a
result
of
the
drinking
of
said
bottles
of
wine
and
bowls
of
punch
it
is
recorded
that
eight
decanters
and
sixty
were
broken
during
the
revolution
some
of
my
forefathers
north
and
south
served
respectably
but
without
distinction
in
the
army
and
others
rendered
similar
service
in
the
continental
congress
or
in
various
local
legislatures
by
that
time
those
who
dwelt
in
the
north
were
for
the
most
part
merchants
and
those
who
dwelt
in
the
south
planters
my
mother
people
were
predominantly
of
scotch
but
also
of
huguenot
and
english
descent
she
was
a
georgian
her
people
having
come
to
georgia
from
south
carolina
before
the
revolution
the
original
bulloch
was
a
lad
from
near
glasgow
who
came
hither
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
just
as
hundreds
of
thousands
of
needy
enterprising
scotchmen
have
gone
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
in
the
intervening
two
hundred
years
my
mother
archibald
bulloch
was
the
first
revolutionary
president
of
georgia
my
grandfather
her
father
spent
the
winters
in
savannah
and
the
summers
at
roswell
in
the
georgia
uplands
near
atlanta
finally
making
roswell
his
permanent
home
he
used
to
travel
thither
with
his
family
and
their
belongings
in
his
own
carriage
followed
by
a
baggage
wagon
i
never
saw
roswell
until
i
was
president
but
my
mother
told
me
so
much
about
the
place
that
when
i
did
see
it
i
felt
as
if
i
already
knew
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
and
as
if
it
were
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
all
the
men
and
women
who
had
lived
there
i
do
not
mean
merely
my
own
family
i
mean
the
slaves
my
mother
and
her
sister
my
aunt
used
to
tell
us
children
all
kinds
of
stories
about
the
slaves
one
of
the
most
fascinating
referred
to
a
very
old
darky
called
bear
bob
because
in
the
early
days
of
settlement
he
had
been
partially
scalped
by
a
black
bear
then
there
was
mom
grace
who
was
for
a
time
my
mother
nurse
and
whom
i
had
supposed
to
be
dead
but
who
greeted
me
when
i
did
come
to
roswell
very
respectable
and
apparently
with
years
of
life
before
her
the
two
chief
personages
of
the
drama
that
used
to
be
repeated
to
us
were
daddy
luke
the
negro
overseer
and
his
wife
mom
charlotte
i
never
saw
either
daddy
luke
or
mom
charlotte
but
i
inherited
the
care
of
them
when
my
mother
died
after
the
close
of
the
war
they
resolutely
refused
to
be
emancipated
or
leave
the
place
the
only
demand
they
made
upon
us
was
enough
money
annually
to
get
a
new
critter
that
is
a
mule
with
a
certain
lack
of
ingenuity
the
mule
was
reported
each
christmas
as
having
passed
away
or
at
least
as
having
become
so
infirm
as
to
necessitate
a
successor
a
solemn
fiction
which
neither
deceived
nor
was
intended
to
deceive
but
which
furnished
a
gauge
for
the
size
of
the
christmas
gift
my
maternal
grandfather
house
was
on
the
line
of
sherman
march
to
the
sea
and
pretty
much
everything
in
it
that
was
portable
was
taken
by
the
boys
in
blue
including
most
of
the
books
in
the
library
when
i
was
president
the
facts
about
my
ancestry
were
published
and
a
former
soldier
in
sherman
army
sent
me
back
one
of
the
books
with
my
grandfather
name
in
it
it
was
a
little
copy
of
the
poems
of
gray
an
edition
printed
in
glasgow
on
october
i
was
born
at
no
east
twentieth
street
new
york
city
in
the
house
in
which
we
lived
during
the
time
that
my
two
sisters
and
my
brother
and
i
were
small
children
it
was
furnished
in
the
canonical
taste
of
the
new
york
which
george
william
curtis
described
in
the
the
black
haircloth
furniture
in
the
scratched
the
bare
legs
of
the
children
when
they
sat
on
it
the
middle
room
was
a
library
with
tables
chairs
and
bookcases
of
gloomy
respectability
it
was
without
windows
and
so
was
available
only
at
night
the
front
room
the
parlor
seemed
to
us
children
to
be
a
room
of
much
splendor
but
was
open
for
general
use
only
on
sunday
evening
or
on
rare
occasions
when
there
were
parties
the
sunday
evening
family
gathering
was
the
redeeming
feature
in
a
day
which
otherwise
we
children
did
not
enjoy
chiefly
because
we
were
all
of
us
made
to
wear
clean
clothes
and
keep
neat
the
ornaments
of
that
parlor
i
remember
now
including
the
gas
chandelier
decorated
with
a
great
quantity
of
prisms
these
prisms
struck
me
as
possessing
peculiar
magnificence
one
of
them
fell
off
one
day
and
i
hastily
grabbed
it
and
stowed
it
away
passing
several
days
of
furtive
delight
in
the
treasure
a
delight
always
alloyed
with
fear
that
i
would
be
found
out
and
convicted
of
larceny
there
was
a
swiss
representing
a
very
big
hunter
on
one
side
of
an
exceedingly
small
mountain
and
a
herd
of
chamois
disproportionately
small
for
the
hunter
and
large
for
the
mountain
just
across
the
ridge
this
always
fascinated
us
but
there
was
a
small
chamois
kid
for
which
we
felt
agonies
lest
the
hunter
might
come
on
it
and
kill
it
there
was
also
a
russian
moujik
drawing
a
gilt
sledge
on
a
piece
of
malachite
some
one
mentioned
in
my
hearing
that
malachite
was
a
valuable
marble
this
fixed
in
my
mind
that
it
was
valuable
exactly
as
diamonds
are
valuable
i
accepted
that
moujik
as
a
priceless
work
of
art
and
it
was
not
until
i
was
well
in
middle
age
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
mistaken
now
and
then
we
children
were
taken
round
to
our
grandfather
house
a
big
house
for
the
new
york
of
those
days
on
the
corner
of
fourteenth
street
and
broadway
fronting
union
square
inside
there
was
a
large
hall
running
up
to
the
roof
there
was
a
tessellated
marble
floor
and
a
circular
staircase
round
the
sides
of
the
hall
from
the
top
floor
down
we
children
much
admired
both
the
tessellated
floor
and
the
circular
staircase
i
think
we
were
right
about
the
latter
but
i
am
not
so
sure
as
to
the
tessellated
floor
the
summers
we
spent
in
the
country
now
at
one
place
now
at
another
we
children
of
course
loved
the
country
beyond
anything
we
disliked
the
city
we
were
always
wildly
eager
to
get
to
the
country
when
spring
came
and
very
sad
when
in
the
late
fall
the
family
moved
back
to
town
in
the
country
we
of
course
had
all
kinds
of
pets
cats
dogs
rabbits
a
coon
and
a
sorrel
shetland
pony
named
general
grant
when
my
younger
sister
first
heard
of
the
real
general
grant
by
the
way
she
was
much
struck
by
the
coincidence
that
some
one
should
have
given
him
the
same
name
as
the
pony
thirty
years
later
my
own
children
had
pony
grant
in
the
country
we
children
ran
barefoot
much
of
the
time
and
the
seasons
went
by
in
a
round
of
uninterrupted
and
enthralling
pleasures
supervising
the
haying
and
harvesting
picking
apples
hunting
frogs
successfully
and
woodchucks
unsuccessfully
gathering
and
chestnuts
for
sale
to
patient
parents
building
wigwams
in
the
woods
and
sometimes
playing
indians
in
too
realistic
manner
by
staining
ourselves
and
incidentally
our
clothes
in
liberal
fashion
with
juice
thanksgiving
was
an
appreciated
festival
but
it
in
no
way
came
up
to
christmas
christmas
was
an
occasion
of
literally
delirious
joy
in
the
evening
we
hung
up
our
stockings
or
rather
the
biggest
stockings
we
could
borrow
from
the
and
before
dawn
we
trooped
in
to
open
them
while
sitting
on
father
and
mother
bed
and
the
bigger
presents
were
arranged
those
for
each
child
on
its
own
table
in
the
the
doors
to
which
were
thrown
open
after
breakfast
i
never
knew
any
one
else
have
what
seemed
to
me
such
attractive
christmases
and
in
the
next
generation
i
tried
to
reproduce
them
exactly
for
my
own
children
my
father
theodore
roosevelt
was
the
best
man
i
ever
knew
he
combined
strength
and
courage
with
gentleness
tenderness
and
great
unselfishness
he
would
not
tolerate
in
us
children
selfishness
or
cruelty
idleness
cowardice
or
untruthfulness
as
we
grew
older
he
made
us
understand
that
the
same
standard
of
clean
living
was
demanded
for
the
boys
as
for
the
girls
that
what
was
wrong
in
a
woman
could
not
be
right
in
a
man
with
great
love
and
patience
and
the
most
understanding
sympathy
and
consideration
he
combined
insistence
on
discipline
he
never
physically
punished
me
but
once
but
he
was
the
only
man
of
whom
i
was
ever
really
afraid
i
do
not
mean
that
it
was
a
wrong
fear
for
he
was
entirely
just
and
we
children
adored
him
we
used
to
wait
in
the
library
in
the
evening
until
we
could
hear
his
key
rattling
in
the
latch
of
the
front
hall
and
then
rush
out
to
greet
him
and
we
would
troop
into
his
room
while
he
was
dressing
to
stay
there
as
long
as
we
were
permitted
eagerly
examining
anything
which
came
out
of
his
pockets
which
could
be
regarded
as
an
attractive
novelty
every
child
has
fixed
in
his
memory
various
details
which
strike
it
as
of
grave
importance
the
trinkets
he
used
to
keep
in
a
little
box
on
his
we
children
always
used
to
speak
of
as
treasures
the
word
and
some
of
the
trinkets
themselves
passed
on
to
the
next
generation
my
own
children
when
small
used
to
troop
into
my
room
while
i
was
dressing
and
the
gradually
accumulating
trinkets
in
the
the
gift
of
an
enlisted
man
in
the
navy
always
excited
rapturous
joy
on
occasions
of
solemn
festivity
each
child
would
receive
a
trinket
for
his
or
her
very
own
my
children
by
the
way
enjoyed
one
pleasure
i
do
not
remember
enjoying
myself
when
i
came
back
from
riding
the
child
who
brought
the
bootjack
would
itself
promptly
get
into
the
boots
and
clump
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
delightful
feeling
of
kinship
with
jack
of
the
strides
the
punishing
incident
i
have
referred
to
happened
when
i
was
four
years
old
i
bit
my
elder
sister
arm
i
do
not
remember
biting
her
arm
but
i
do
remember
running
down
to
the
yard
perfectly
conscious
that
i
had
committed
a
crime
from
the
yard
i
went
into
the
kitchen
got
some
dough
from
the
cook
and
crawled
under
the
kitchen
table
in
a
minute
or
two
my
father
entered
from
the
yard
and
asked
where
i
was
the
irish
cook
had
a
characteristic
contempt
for
informers
but
although
she
said
nothing
she
compromised
between
informing
and
her
conscience
by
casting
a
look
under
the
table
my
father
immediately
dropped
on
all
fours
and
darted
for
me
i
feebly
heaved
the
dough
at
him
and
having
the
advantage
of
him
because
i
could
stand
up
under
the
table
got
a
fair
start
for
the
stairs
but
was
caught
halfway
up
them
the
punishment
that
ensued
fitted
the
crime
and
i
hope
and
believe
that
it
did
me
good
i
never
knew
any
one
who
got
greater
joy
out
of
living
than
did
my
father
or
any
one
who
more
performed
every
duty
and
no
one
whom
i
have
ever
met
approached
his
combination
of
enjoyment
of
life
and
performance
of
duty
he
and
my
mother
were
given
to
a
hospitality
that
at
that
time
was
associated
more
commonly
with
southern
than
northern
households
and
especially
in
their
later
years
when
they
had
moved
up
town
in
the
neighborhood
of
central
park
they
kept
a
charming
open
house
my
father
worked
hard
at
his
business
for
he
died
when
he
was
too
early
to
have
retired
he
was
interested
in
every
social
reform
movement
and
he
did
an
immense
amount
of
practical
charitable
work
himself
he
was
a
big
powerful
man
with
a
leonine
face
and
his
heart
filled
with
gentleness
for
those
who
needed
help
or
protection
and
with
the
possibility
of
much
wrath
against
a
bully
or
an
oppressor
he
was
very
fond
of
riding
both
on
the
road
and
across
the
country
and
was
also
a
great
whip
he
usually
drove
or
else
a
spike
team
that
is
a
pair
with
a
third
horse
in
the
lead
i
do
not
suppose
that
such
a
team
exists
now
the
trap
that
he
drove
we
always
called
the
high
phaeton
the
wheels
turned
under
in
front
i
have
it
yet
he
drove
horses
harnessed
loose
in
light
american
harness
so
that
the
whole
rig
had
no
possible
resemblance
to
anything
that
would
be
seen
now
my
father
always
excelled
in
improving
every
spare
or
of
an
hour
whether
for
work
or
enjoyment
much
of
his
driving
was
done
in
the
summer
afternoons
when
he
would
come
out
on
the
train
from
his
business
in
new
york
my
mother
and
one
or
perhaps
two
of
us
children
might
meet
him
at
the
station
i
can
see
him
now
getting
out
of
the
car
in
his
linen
duster
jumping
into
the
wagon
and
instantly
driving
off
at
a
rattling
pace
the
duster
sometimes
bagging
like
a
balloon
the
as
can
be
gathered
from
the
above
description
did
not
in
any
way
in
his
eyes
represent
possible
pageantry
he
drove
it
because
he
liked
it
he
was
always
preaching
caution
to
his
boys
but
in
this
respect
he
did
not
practice
his
preaching
overmuch
himself
and
being
an
excellent
whip
he
liked
to
take
chances
generally
they
came
out
all
right
occasionally
they
did
not
but
he
was
even
better
at
getting
out
of
a
scrape
than
into
it
once
when
we
were
driving
into
new
york
late
at
night
the
leaders
stopped
he
flicked
them
and
the
next
moment
we
could
dimly
make
out
that
they
had
jumped
it
then
appeared
that
the
street
was
closed
and
that
a
board
had
been
placed
across
it
resting
on
two
barrels
but
without
a
lantern
over
this
board
the
leaders
had
jumped
and
there
was
considerable
excitement
before
we
got
the
board
taken
off
the
barrels
and
resumed
our
way
when
in
the
city
on
thanksgiving
or
christmas
my
father
was
very
apt
to
drive
my
mother
and
a
couple
of
friends
up
to
the
racing
park
to
take
lunch
but
he
was
always
back
in
time
to
go
to
the
dinner
at
the
newsboys
and
not
infrequently
also
to
miss
sattery
night
school
for
little
italians
at
a
very
early
age
we
children
were
taken
with
him
and
were
required
to
help
he
was
a
staunch
friend
of
charles
loring
brace
and
was
particularly
interested
in
the
newsboys
and
in
the
night
schools
and
in
getting
the
children
off
the
streets
and
out
on
farms
in
the
west
when
i
was
president
the
governor
of
alaska
under
me
governor
brady
was
one
of
these
who
had
been
sent
from
new
york
out
west
by
brace
and
my
father
my
father
was
greatly
interested
in
the
societies
to
prevent
cruelty
to
children
and
cruelty
to
animals
on
sundays
he
had
a
mission
class
on
his
way
to
it
he
used
to
drop
us
children
at
our
in
adams
presbyterian
church
on
madison
square
i
remember
hearing
my
aunt
my
mother
sister
saying
that
when
he
walked
along
with
us
children
he
always
reminded
her
of
greatheart
in
bunyan
under
the
spur
of
his
example
i
taught
a
mission
class
myself
for
three
years
before
going
to
college
and
for
all
four
years
that
i
was
in
college
i
do
not
think
i
made
much
of
a
success
of
it
but
the
other
day
on
getting
out
of
a
taxi
in
new
york
the
chauffeur
spoke
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
one
of
my
old
pupils
i
remembered
him
well
and
was
much
pleased
to
find
that
he
was
an
ardent
bull
mooser
my
mother
martha
bulloch
was
a
sweet
gracious
beautiful
southern
woman
a
delightful
companion
and
beloved
by
everybody
she
was
entirely
unreconstructed
to
the
day
of
her
death
her
mother
my
grandmother
one
of
the
dearest
of
old
ladies
lived
with
us
and
was
distinctly
overindulgent
to
us
children
being
quite
unable
to
harden
her
heart
towards
us
even
when
the
occasion
demanded
it
towards
the
close
of
the
civil
war
although
a
very
small
boy
i
grew
to
have
a
partial
but
alert
understanding
of
the
fact
that
the
family
were
not
one
in
their
views
about
that
conflict
my
father
being
a
strong
lincoln
republican
and
once
when
i
felt
that
i
had
been
wronged
by
maternal
discipline
during
the
day
i
attempted
a
partial
vengeance
by
praying
with
loud
fervor
for
the
success
of
the
union
arms
when
we
all
came
to
say
our
prayers
before
my
mother
in
the
evening
she
was
not
only
a
most
devoted
mother
but
was
also
blessed
with
a
strong
sense
of
humor
and
she
was
too
much
amused
to
punish
me
but
i
was
warned
not
to
repeat
the
offense
under
penalty
of
my
father
being
informed
he
being
the
dispenser
of
serious
punishment
morning
prayers
were
with
my
father
we
used
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
when
father
came
down
we
called
out
i
speak
for
you
and
the
too
there
were
three
of
us
young
children
and
we
used
to
sit
with
father
on
the
sofa
while
he
conducted
morning
prayers
the
place
between
father
and
the
arm
of
the
sofa
we
called
the
the
child
who
got
that
place
we
regarded
as
especially
favored
both
in
comfort
and
somehow
or
other
in
rank
and
title
the
two
who
were
left
to
sit
on
the
much
wider
expanse
of
sofa
on
the
other
side
of
father
were
outsiders
for
the
time
being
my
aunt
anna
my
mother
sister
lived
with
us
she
was
as
devoted
to
us
children
as
was
my
mother
herself
and
we
were
equally
devoted
to
her
in
return
she
taught
us
our
lessons
while
we
were
little
she
and
my
mother
used
to
entertain
us
by
the
hour
with
tales
of
life
on
the
georgia
plantations
of
hunting
fox
deer
and
wildcat
of
the
driving
horses
boone
and
crockett
and
of
the
riding
horses
one
of
which
was
named
buena
vista
in
a
fit
of
patriotic
exaltation
during
the
mexican
war
and
of
the
queer
in
the
negro
quarters
she
knew
all
the
rabbit
stories
and
i
was
brought
up
on
them
one
of
my
uncles
robert
roosevelt
was
much
struck
with
them
and
took
them
down
from
her
dictation
publishing
them
in
where
they
fell
flat
this
was
a
good
many
years
before
a
genius
arose
who
in
uncle
remus
made
the
stories
immortal
my
mother
two
brothers
james
dunwoodie
bulloch
and
irvine
bulloch
came
to
visit
us
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
war
both
came
under
assumed
names
as
they
were
among
the
confederates
who
were
at
that
time
exempted
from
the
amnesty
uncle
jimmy
bulloch
was
a
dear
old
retired
utterly
unable
to
get
on
in
the
worldly
sense
of
that
phrase
as
valiant
and
simple
and
upright
a
soul
as
ever
lived
a
veritable
colonel
newcome
he
was
an
admiral
in
the
confederate
navy
and
was
the
builder
of
the
famous
confederate
war
vessel
alabama
my
uncle
irvine
bulloch
was
a
midshipman
on
the
and
fired
the
last
gun
discharged
from
her
batteries
in
the
fight
with
the
both
of
these
uncles
lived
in
liverpool
after
the
war
my
uncle
jimmy
bulloch
was
forgiving
and
just
in
reference
to
the
union
forces
and
could
discuss
all
phases
of
the
civil
war
with
entire
fairness
and
generosity
but
in
english
politics
he
promptly
became
a
tory
of
the
most
school
lincoln
and
grant
he
could
admire
but
he
would
not
listen
to
anything
in
favor
of
gladstone
the
only
occasions
on
which
i
ever
shook
his
faith
in
me
were
when
i
would
venture
meekly
to
suggest
that
some
of
the
manifestly
preposterous
falsehoods
about
gladstone
could
not
be
true
my
uncle
was
one
of
the
best
men
i
have
ever
known
and
when
i
have
sometimes
been
tempted
to
wonder
how
good
people
can
believe
of
me
the
unjust
and
impossible
things
they
do
believe
i
have
consoled
myself
by
thinking
of
uncle
jimmy
bulloch
perfectly
sincere
conviction
that
gladstone
was
a
man
of
quite
exceptional
and
nameless
infamy
in
both
public
and
private
life
i
was
a
sickly
delicate
boy
suffered
much
from
asthma
and
frequently
had
to
be
taken
away
on
trips
to
find
a
place
where
i
could
breathe
one
of
my
memories
is
of
my
father
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
me
in
his
arms
at
night
when
i
was
a
very
small
person
and
of
sitting
up
in
bed
gasping
with
my
father
and
mother
trying
to
help
me
i
went
very
little
to
school
i
never
went
to
the
public
schools
as
my
own
children
later
did
both
at
the
cove
school
at
oyster
bay
and
at
the
ford
school
in
washington
for
a
few
months
i
attended
professor
school
in
twentieth
street
near
the
house
where
i
was
born
but
most
of
the
time
i
had
tutors
as
i
have
already
said
my
aunt
taught
me
when
i
was
small
at
one
time
we
had
a
french
governess
a
loved
and
valued
in
the
household
when
i
was
ten
years
old
i
made
my
first
journey
to
europe
my
birthday
was
spent
in
cologne
and
in
order
to
give
me
a
thoroughly
party
feeling
i
remember
that
my
mother
put
on
full
dress
for
my
birthday
dinner
i
do
not
think
i
gained
anything
from
this
particular
trip
abroad
i
cordially
hated
it
as
did
my
younger
brother
and
sister
practically
all
the
enjoyment
we
had
was
in
exploring
any
ruins
or
mountains
when
we
could
get
away
from
our
elders
and
in
playing
in
the
different
hotels
our
one
desire
was
to
get
back
to
america
and
we
regarded
europe
with
the
most
ignorant
chauvinism
and
contempt
four
years
later
however
i
made
another
journey
to
europe
and
was
old
enough
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
and
profit
by
it
while
still
a
small
boy
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
natural
history
i
remember
distinctly
the
first
day
that
i
started
on
my
career
as
zoologist
i
was
walking
up
broadway
and
as
i
passed
the
market
to
which
i
used
sometimes
to
be
sent
before
breakfast
to
get
strawberries
i
suddenly
saw
a
dead
seal
laid
out
on
a
slab
of
wood
that
seal
filled
me
with
every
possible
feeling
of
romance
and
adventure
i
asked
where
it
was
killed
and
was
informed
in
the
harbor
i
had
already
begun
to
read
some
of
mayne
reid
books
and
other
boys
books
of
adventure
and
i
felt
that
this
seal
brought
all
these
adventures
in
realistic
fashion
before
me
as
long
as
that
seal
remained
there
i
haunted
the
neighborhood
of
the
market
day
after
day
i
measured
it
and
i
recall
that
not
having
a
tape
measure
i
had
to
do
my
best
to
get
its
girth
with
a
folding
pocket
a
difficult
undertaking
i
carefully
made
a
record
of
the
utterly
useless
measurements
and
at
once
began
to
write
a
natural
history
of
my
own
on
the
strength
of
that
seal
this
and
subsequent
natural
histories
were
written
down
in
blank
books
in
simplified
spelling
wholly
unpremeditated
and
unscientific
i
had
vague
aspirations
of
in
some
way
or
another
owning
and
preserving
that
seal
but
they
never
got
beyond
the
purely
formless
stage
i
think
however
i
did
get
the
seal
skull
and
with
two
of
my
cousins
promptly
started
what
we
ambitiously
called
the
roosevelt
museum
of
natural
history
the
collections
were
at
first
kept
in
my
room
until
a
rebellion
on
the
part
of
the
chambermaid
received
the
approval
of
the
higher
authorities
of
the
household
and
the
collection
was
moved
up
to
a
kind
of
bookcase
in
the
back
hall
upstairs
it
was
the
ordinary
small
boy
collection
of
curios
quite
incongruous
and
entirely
valueless
except
from
the
standpoint
of
the
boy
himself
my
father
and
mother
encouraged
me
warmly
in
this
as
they
always
did
in
anything
that
could
give
me
wholesome
pleasure
or
help
to
develop
me
the
adventure
of
the
seal
and
the
novels
of
mayne
reid
together
strengthened
my
instinctive
interest
in
natural
history
i
was
too
young
to
understand
much
of
mayne
reid
excepting
the
adventure
part
and
the
natural
history
part
these
enthralled
me
but
of
course
my
reading
was
not
wholly
confined
to
natural
history
there
was
very
little
effort
made
to
compel
me
to
read
books
my
father
and
mother
having
the
good
sense
not
to
try
to
get
me
to
read
anything
i
did
not
like
unless
it
was
in
the
way
of
study
i
was
given
the
chance
to
read
books
that
they
thought
i
ought
to
read
but
if
i
did
not
like
them
i
was
then
given
some
other
good
book
that
i
did
like
there
were
certain
books
that
were
taboo
for
instance
i
was
not
allowed
to
read
dime
novels
i
obtained
some
surreptitiously
and
did
read
them
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
enjoyment
compensated
for
the
feeling
of
guilt
i
was
also
forbidden
to
read
the
only
one
of
ouida
books
which
i
wished
to
read
under
two
flags
i
did
read
it
nevertheless
with
greedy
and
fierce
hope
of
coming
on
something
unhealthy
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
parts
that
might
have
seemed
unhealthy
to
an
older
person
made
no
impression
on
me
whatever
i
simply
enjoyed
in
a
rather
confused
way
the
general
adventures
i
think
there
ought
to
be
children
books
i
think
that
the
child
will
like
books
also
and
i
do
not
believe
a
child
book
is
really
good
unless
get
something
out
of
it
for
instance
there
is
a
book
i
did
not
have
when
i
was
a
child
because
it
was
not
written
it
is
laura
richard
nursery
rhymes
my
own
children
loved
them
dearly
and
their
mother
and
i
loved
them
almost
equally
the
delightfully
man
from
new
mexico
who
lost
his
grandmother
out
in
the
snow
the
adventures
of
the
owl
the
eel
and
the
and
the
extraordinary
genealogy
of
the
kangaroo
whose
father
was
a
whale
with
a
feather
in
his
tail
who
lived
in
the
greenland
sea
while
his
mother
was
a
shark
who
kept
very
dark
in
the
gulf
of
caribee
as
a
small
boy
i
had
young
which
i
then
firmly
believed
to
be
the
very
best
magazine
in
the
world
a
belief
i
may
add
which
i
have
kept
to
this
day
unchanged
for
i
seriously
doubt
if
any
magazine
for
old
or
young
has
ever
surpassed
it
both
my
wife
and
i
have
the
bound
volumes
of
young
which
we
preserved
from
our
youth
i
have
tried
to
read
again
the
mayne
reid
books
which
i
so
dearly
loved
as
a
boy
only
to
find
alas
that
it
is
impossible
but
i
really
believe
that
i
enjoy
going
over
young
now
nearly
as
much
as
ever
cast
away
in
the
cold
grandfather
struggle
for
a
homestead
the
william
henry
letters
and
a
dozen
others
like
them
were
good
healthy
stories
interesting
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
next
place
teaching
manliness
decency
and
good
conduct
at
the
cost
of
being
deemed
effeminate
i
will
add
that
i
greatly
liked
the
stories
pussy
willow
and
a
summer
in
leslie
life
just
as
i
worshiped
little
men
and
little
women
and
an
girl
this
enjoyment
of
the
gentler
side
of
life
did
not
prevent
my
reveling
in
such
tales
of
adventure
as
ballantyne
stories
or
midshipman
easy
i
suppose
everybody
has
kinks
in
him
and
even
as
a
child
there
were
books
which
i
ought
to
have
liked
and
did
not
for
instance
i
never
cared
at
all
for
the
first
part
of
robinson
crusoe
and
although
it
is
unquestionably
the
best
part
i
do
not
care
for
it
now
whereas
the
second
part
containing
the
adventures
of
robinson
crusoe
with
the
wolves
in
the
pyrenees
and
out
in
the
far
east
simply
fascinated
me
what
i
did
like
in
the
first
part
were
the
adventures
before
crusoe
finally
reached
his
island
the
fight
with
the
sallee
rover
and
the
allusion
to
the
strange
beasts
at
night
taking
their
improbable
bath
in
the
ocean
thanks
to
being
already
an
embryo
zoologist
i
disliked
the
swiss
family
robinson
because
of
the
wholly
impossible
collection
of
animals
met
by
that
worthy
family
as
they
ambled
inland
from
the
wreck
even
in
poetry
it
was
the
relation
of
adventures
that
most
appealed
to
me
as
a
boy
at
a
pretty
early
age
i
began
to
read
certain
books
of
poetry
notably
longfellow
poem
the
saga
of
king
olaf
which
absorbed
me
this
introduced
me
to
scandinavian
literature
and
i
have
never
lost
my
interest
in
and
affection
for
it
among
my
first
books
was
a
volume
of
a
hopelessly
unscientific
kind
by
mayne
reid
about
mammals
illustrated
with
pictures
no
more
artistic
than
but
quite
as
thrilling
as
those
in
the
typical
school
geography
when
my
father
found
how
deeply
interested
i
was
in
this
not
very
accurate
volume
he
gave
me
a
little
book
by
wood
the
english
writer
of
popular
books
on
natural
history
and
then
a
larger
one
of
his
called
homes
without
hands
both
of
these
were
cherished
possessions
they
were
studied
eagerly
and
they
finally
descended
to
my
children
the
homes
without
hands
by
the
way
grew
to
have
an
added
association
in
connection
with
a
pedagogical
failure
on
my
part
in
accordance
with
what
i
believed
was
some
kind
of
modern
theory
of
making
education
interesting
and
not
letting
it
become
a
task
i
endeavored
to
teach
my
eldest
small
boy
one
or
two
of
his
letters
from
the
as
the
letter
h
appeared
in
the
title
an
unusual
number
of
times
i
selected
that
to
begin
on
my
effort
being
to
keep
the
small
boy
interested
not
to
let
him
realize
that
he
was
learning
a
lesson
and
to
convince
him
that
he
was
merely
having
a
good
time
whether
it
was
the
theory
or
my
method
of
applying
it
that
was
defective
i
do
not
know
but
i
certainly
absolutely
eradicated
from
his
brain
any
ability
to
learn
what
h
was
and
long
after
he
had
learned
all
the
other
letters
of
the
alphabet
in
the
way
he
proved
wholly
unable
to
remember
h
under
any
circumstances
quite
unknown
to
myself
i
was
while
a
boy
under
a
hopeless
disadvantage
in
studying
nature
i
was
very
so
that
the
only
things
i
could
study
were
those
i
ran
against
or
stumbled
over
when
i
was
about
thirteen
i
was
allowed
to
take
lessons
in
taxidermy
from
a
bell
a
tall
old
gentleman
as
straight
as
an
indian
who
had
been
a
companion
of
audubon
he
had
a
musty
little
shop
somewhat
on
the
order
of
venus
shop
in
our
mutual
friend
a
little
shop
in
which
he
had
done
very
valuable
work
for
science
this
vocational
study
as
i
suppose
it
would
be
called
by
modern
educators
spurred
and
directed
my
interest
in
collecting
specimens
for
mounting
and
preservation
it
was
this
summer
that
i
got
my
first
gun
and
it
puzzled
me
to
find
that
my
companions
seemed
to
see
things
to
shoot
at
which
i
could
not
see
at
all
one
day
they
read
aloud
an
advertisement
in
huge
letters
on
a
distant
billboard
and
i
then
realized
that
something
was
the
matter
for
not
only
was
i
unable
to
read
the
sign
but
i
could
not
even
see
the
letters
i
spoke
of
this
to
my
father
and
soon
afterwards
got
my
first
pair
of
spectacles
which
literally
opened
an
entirely
new
world
to
me
i
had
no
idea
how
beautiful
the
world
was
until
i
got
those
spectacles
i
had
been
a
clumsy
and
awkward
little
boy
and
while
much
of
my
clumsiness
and
awkwardness
was
doubtless
due
to
general
characteristics
a
good
deal
of
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
could
not
see
and
yet
was
wholly
ignorant
that
i
was
not
seeing
the
recollection
of
this
experience
gives
me
a
keen
sympathy
with
those
who
are
trying
in
our
public
schools
and
elsewhere
to
remove
the
physical
causes
of
deficiency
in
children
who
are
often
unjustly
blamed
for
being
obstinate
or
unambitious
or
mentally
stupid
this
same
summer
too
i
obtained
various
new
books
on
mammals
and
birds
including
the
publications
of
spencer
baird
for
instance
and
made
an
industrious
of
the
subject
i
did
not
accomplish
much
in
outdoor
study
because
i
did
not
get
spectacles
until
late
in
the
fall
a
short
time
before
i
started
with
the
rest
of
the
family
for
a
second
trip
to
europe
we
were
living
at
dobbs
ferry
on
the
hudson
my
gun
was
a
of
french
manufacture
it
was
an
excellent
gun
for
a
clumsy
and
often
boy
there
was
no
spring
to
open
it
and
if
the
mechanism
became
rusty
it
could
be
opened
with
a
brick
without
serious
damage
when
the
cartridges
stuck
they
could
be
removed
in
the
same
fashion
if
they
were
loaded
however
the
result
was
not
always
happy
and
i
tattooed
myself
with
partially
unburned
grains
of
powder
more
than
once
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
in
the
winter
of
and
i
visited
europe
for
the
second
time
and
this
trip
formed
a
really
useful
part
of
my
education
we
went
to
egypt
journeyed
up
the
nile
traveled
through
the
holy
land
and
part
of
syria
visited
greece
and
constantinople
and
then
we
children
spent
the
summer
in
a
german
family
in
dresden
my
first
real
collecting
as
a
student
of
natural
history
was
done
in
egypt
during
this
journey
by
this
time
i
had
a
good
working
knowledge
of
american
bird
life
from
the
superficially
scientific
standpoint
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
ornithology
of
egypt
but
i
picked
up
in
cairo
a
book
by
an
english
clergyman
whose
name
i
have
now
forgotten
who
described
a
trip
up
the
nile
and
in
an
appendix
to
his
volume
gave
an
account
of
his
bird
collection
i
wish
i
could
remember
the
name
of
the
author
now
for
i
owe
that
book
very
much
without
it
i
should
have
been
collecting
entirely
in
the
dark
whereas
with
its
aid
i
could
generally
find
out
what
the
birds
were
my
first
knowledge
of
latin
was
obtained
by
learning
the
scientific
names
of
the
birds
and
mammals
which
i
collected
and
classified
by
the
aid
of
such
books
as
this
one
the
birds
i
obtained
up
the
nile
and
in
palestine
represented
merely
the
usual
boy
collection
some
years
afterward
i
gave
them
together
with
the
other
ornithological
specimens
i
had
gathered
to
the
smithsonian
institution
in
washington
and
i
think
some
of
them
also
to
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
in
new
york
i
am
told
that
the
skins
are
to
be
found
yet
in
both
places
and
in
other
public
collections
i
doubt
whether
they
have
my
original
labels
on
them
with
great
pride
the
directors
of
the
roosevelt
museum
consisting
of
myself
and
the
two
cousins
aforesaid
had
printed
a
set
of
roosevelt
museum
labels
in
pink
ink
preliminary
to
what
was
regarded
as
my
adventurous
trip
to
egypt
this
gave
what
was
really
the
chief
zest
to
my
nile
journey
i
was
old
enough
and
had
read
enough
to
enjoy
the
temples
and
the
desert
scenery
and
the
general
feeling
of
romance
but
this
in
time
would
have
palled
if
i
had
not
also
had
the
serious
work
of
collecting
and
preparing
my
specimens
doubtless
the
family
had
their
moments
of
suffering
especially
on
one
occasion
when
a
maid
extracted
from
my
taxidermist
outfit
the
old
with
which
i
put
on
the
skins
the
arsenical
soap
necessary
for
their
preservation
partially
washed
it
and
left
it
with
the
rest
of
my
wash
kit
for
my
own
personal
use
i
suppose
that
all
growing
boys
tend
to
be
grubby
but
the
ornithological
small
boy
or
indeed
the
boy
with
the
taste
for
natural
history
of
any
kind
is
generally
the
very
grubbiest
of
all
an
added
element
in
my
case
was
the
fact
that
while
in
egypt
i
suddenly
started
to
grow
as
there
were
no
tailors
up
the
nile
when
i
got
back
to
cairo
i
needed
a
new
outfit
but
there
was
one
suit
of
clothes
too
good
to
throw
away
which
we
kept
for
a
change
and
which
was
known
as
my
smike
suit
because
it
left
my
wrists
and
ankles
as
bare
as
those
of
poor
smike
himself
when
we
reached
dresden
we
younger
children
were
left
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
house
of
herr
minckwitz
a
member
of
either
the
municipal
or
the
saxon
government
i
have
forgotten
which
it
was
hoped
that
in
this
way
we
would
acquire
some
knowledge
of
the
german
language
and
literature
they
were
the
very
kindest
family
imaginable
i
shall
never
forget
the
unwearied
patience
of
the
two
daughters
the
father
and
mother
and
a
shy
thin
student
cousin
who
was
living
in
the
flat
were
no
less
kind
whenever
i
could
get
out
into
the
country
i
collected
specimens
industriously
and
enlivened
the
household
with
and
other
small
beasts
and
reptiles
which
persisted
in
escaping
from
partially
closed
bureau
drawers
the
two
sons
were
fascinating
students
from
the
university
of
leipsic
both
of
them
belonging
to
dueling
corps
and
much
scarred
in
consequence
one
a
famous
swordsman
was
called
rothe
the
red
duke
and
the
other
was
nicknamed
sir
rhinoceros
because
the
tip
of
his
nose
had
been
cut
off
in
a
duel
and
sewn
on
again
i
learned
a
good
deal
of
german
here
in
spite
of
myself
and
above
all
i
became
fascinated
with
the
nibelungenlied
german
prose
never
became
really
easy
to
me
in
the
sense
that
french
prose
did
but
for
german
poetry
i
cared
as
much
as
for
english
poetry
above
all
i
gained
an
impression
of
the
german
people
which
i
never
got
over
from
that
time
to
this
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
to
make
me
feel
that
the
germans
were
really
foreigners
the
affection
the
a
quality
which
can
not
be
exactly
expressed
by
any
single
english
word
the
capacity
for
hard
work
the
sense
of
duty
the
delight
in
studying
literature
and
science
the
pride
in
the
new
germany
the
more
than
kind
and
friendly
interest
in
three
strange
children
all
these
manifestations
of
the
german
character
and
of
german
family
life
made
a
subconscious
impression
upon
me
which
i
did
not
in
the
least
define
at
the
time
but
which
is
very
vivid
still
forty
years
later
when
i
got
back
to
america
at
the
age
of
fifteen
i
began
serious
study
to
enter
harvard
under
arthur
cutler
who
later
founded
the
cutler
school
in
new
york
i
could
not
go
to
school
because
i
knew
so
much
less
than
most
boys
of
my
age
in
some
subjects
and
so
much
more
in
others
in
science
and
history
and
geography
and
in
unexpected
parts
of
german
and
french
i
was
strong
but
lamentably
weak
in
latin
and
greek
and
mathematics
my
grandfather
had
made
his
summer
home
in
oyster
bay
a
number
of
years
before
and
my
father
now
made
oyster
bay
the
summer
home
of
his
family
also
along
with
my
college
preparatory
studies
i
carried
on
the
work
of
a
practical
student
of
natural
history
i
worked
with
greater
industry
than
either
intelligence
or
success
and
made
very
few
additions
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
but
to
this
day
certain
obscure
ornithological
publications
may
be
found
in
which
are
recorded
such
items
as
for
instance
that
on
one
occasion
a
and
on
another
an
ipswich
sparrow
were
obtained
by
one
theodore
roosevelt
at
oyster
bay
on
the
shore
of
long
island
sound
in
the
fall
of
i
entered
harvard
graduating
in
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
harvard
and
i
am
sure
it
did
me
good
but
only
in
the
general
effect
for
there
was
very
little
in
my
actual
studies
which
helped
me
in
after
life
more
than
one
of
my
own
sons
have
already
profited
by
their
friendship
with
certain
of
their
masters
in
school
or
college
i
certainly
profited
by
my
friendship
with
one
of
my
tutors
cutler
and
in
harvard
i
owed
much
to
the
professor
of
english
hill
doubtless
through
my
own
fault
i
saw
almost
nothing
of
president
eliot
and
very
little
of
the
professors
i
ought
to
have
gained
much
more
than
i
did
gain
from
writing
the
themes
and
forensics
my
failure
to
do
so
may
have
been
partly
due
to
my
taking
no
interest
in
the
subjects
before
i
left
harvard
i
was
already
writing
one
or
two
chapters
of
a
book
i
afterwards
published
on
the
naval
war
of
those
chapters
were
so
dry
that
they
would
have
made
a
dictionary
seem
light
reading
by
comparison
still
they
represented
purpose
and
serious
interest
on
my
part
not
the
perfunctory
effort
to
do
well
enough
to
get
a
certain
mark
and
corrections
of
them
by
a
skilled
older
man
would
have
impressed
me
and
have
commanded
my
respectful
attention
but
i
was
not
sufficiently
developed
to
make
myself
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
some
of
the
subjects
assigned
me
the
character
of
the
gracchi
for
instance
a
very
clever
and
studious
lad
would
no
doubt
have
done
so
but
i
personally
did
not
grow
up
to
this
particular
subject
until
a
good
many
years
later
the
frigate
and
sloop
actions
between
the
american
and
british
of
were
much
more
within
my
grasp
i
worked
drearily
at
the
gracchi
because
i
had
to
my
conscientious
and
professor
dragging
me
through
the
theme
by
main
strength
with
my
feet
firmly
planted
in
dull
and
totally
resistance
i
had
at
the
time
no
idea
of
going
into
public
life
and
i
never
studied
elocution
or
practiced
debating
this
was
a
loss
to
me
in
one
way
in
another
way
it
was
not
personally
i
have
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
debating
contests
in
which
each
side
is
arbitrarily
assigned
a
given
proposition
and
told
to
maintain
it
without
the
least
reference
to
whether
those
maintaining
it
believe
in
it
or
not
i
know
that
under
our
system
this
is
necessary
for
lawyers
but
i
emphatically
disbelieve
in
it
as
regards
general
discussion
of
political
social
and
industrial
matters
what
we
need
is
to
turn
out
of
our
colleges
young
men
with
ardent
convictions
on
the
side
of
the
right
not
young
men
who
can
make
a
good
argument
for
either
right
or
wrong
as
their
interest
bids
them
the
present
method
of
carrying
on
debates
on
such
subjects
as
our
colonial
policy
or
the
need
of
a
navy
or
the
proper
position
of
the
courts
in
constitutional
questions
encourages
precisely
the
wrong
attitude
among
those
who
take
part
in
them
there
is
no
effort
to
instill
sincerity
and
intensity
of
conviction
on
the
contrary
the
net
result
is
to
make
the
contestants
feel
that
their
convictions
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
arguments
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
study
elocution
in
college
but
i
am
exceedingly
glad
that
i
did
not
take
part
in
the
type
of
debate
in
which
stress
is
laid
not
upon
getting
a
speaker
to
think
rightly
but
on
getting
him
to
talk
glibly
on
the
side
to
which
he
is
assigned
without
regard
either
to
what
his
convictions
are
or
to
what
they
ought
to
be
i
was
a
reasonably
good
student
in
college
standing
just
within
the
first
tenth
of
my
class
if
i
remember
rightly
although
i
am
not
sure
whether
this
means
the
tenth
of
the
whole
number
that
entered
or
of
those
that
graduated
i
was
given
a
phi
beta
kappa
key
my
chief
interests
were
scientific
when
i
entered
college
i
was
devoted
to
natural
history
and
my
ambition
was
to
be
a
scientific
man
of
the
audubon
or
wilson
or
baird
or
coues
type
a
man
like
hart
merriam
or
frank
chapman
or
hornaday
my
father
had
from
the
earliest
days
instilled
into
me
the
knowledge
that
i
was
to
work
and
to
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
and
i
had
always
supposed
that
this
meant
that
i
must
enter
business
but
in
my
freshman
year
he
died
when
i
was
a
sophomore
he
told
me
that
if
i
wished
to
become
a
scientific
man
i
could
do
so
he
explained
that
i
must
be
sure
that
i
really
intensely
desired
to
do
scientific
work
because
if
i
went
into
it
i
must
make
it
a
serious
career
that
he
had
made
enough
money
to
enable
me
to
take
up
such
a
career
and
do
work
of
value
i
intended
to
do
the
very
best
work
there
was
in
but
that
i
must
not
dream
of
taking
it
up
as
a
dilettante
he
also
gave
me
a
piece
of
advice
that
i
have
always
remembered
namely
that
if
i
was
not
going
to
earn
money
i
must
even
things
up
by
not
spending
it
as
he
expressed
it
i
had
to
keep
the
fraction
constant
and
if
i
was
not
able
to
increase
the
numerator
then
i
must
reduce
the
denominator
in
other
words
if
i
went
into
a
scientific
career
i
must
definitely
abandon
all
thought
of
the
enjoyment
that
could
accompany
a
career
and
must
find
my
pleasures
elsewhere
after
this
conversation
i
fully
intended
to
make
science
my
i
did
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
at
that
time
harvard
and
i
suppose
our
other
colleges
utterly
ignored
the
possibilities
of
the
faunal
naturalist
the
outdoor
naturalist
and
observer
of
nature
they
treated
biology
as
purely
a
science
of
the
laboratory
and
the
microscope
a
science
whose
adherents
were
to
spend
their
time
in
the
study
of
minute
forms
of
marine
life
or
else
in
and
the
study
of
the
tissues
of
the
higher
organisms
under
the
microscope
this
attitude
was
no
doubt
in
part
due
to
the
fact
that
in
most
colleges
then
there
was
a
not
always
intelligent
copying
of
what
was
done
in
the
great
german
universities
the
sound
revolt
against
superficiality
of
study
had
been
carried
to
an
extreme
thoroughness
in
minutiae
as
the
only
end
of
study
had
been
erected
into
a
fetish
there
was
a
total
failure
to
understand
the
great
variety
of
kinds
of
work
that
could
be
done
by
naturalists
including
what
could
be
done
by
outdoor
naturalists
the
kind
of
work
which
hart
merriam
and
his
assistants
in
the
biological
survey
have
carried
to
such
a
high
degree
of
perfection
as
regards
north
american
mammals
in
the
entirely
proper
desire
to
be
thorough
and
to
avoid
slipshod
methods
the
tendency
was
to
treat
as
not
serious
as
unscientific
any
kind
of
work
that
was
not
carried
on
with
laborious
minuteness
in
the
laboratory
my
taste
was
specialized
in
a
totally
different
direction
and
i
had
no
more
desire
or
ability
to
be
a
microscopist
and
than
to
be
a
mathematician
accordingly
i
abandoned
all
thought
of
becoming
a
scientist
doubtless
this
meant
that
i
really
did
not
have
the
intense
devotion
to
science
which
i
thought
i
had
for
if
i
had
possessed
such
devotion
i
would
have
carved
out
a
career
for
myself
somehow
without
regard
to
discouragements
as
regards
political
economy
i
was
of
course
while
in
college
taught
the
doctrines
one
of
them
being
free
trade
then
accepted
as
canonical
most
american
boys
of
my
age
were
taught
both
by
their
surroundings
and
by
their
studies
certain
principles
which
were
very
valuable
from
the
standpoint
of
national
interest
and
certain
others
which
were
very
much
the
reverse
the
political
economists
were
not
especially
to
blame
for
this
it
was
the
general
attitude
of
the
writers
who
wrote
for
us
of
that
generation
take
my
beloved
young
the
magazine
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
and
which
taught
me
much
more
than
any
of
my
everything
in
this
magazine
instilled
the
individual
virtues
and
the
necessity
of
character
as
the
chief
factor
in
any
man
success
a
teaching
in
which
i
now
believe
as
sincerely
as
ever
for
all
the
laws
that
the
wit
of
man
can
devise
will
never
make
a
man
a
worthy
citizen
unless
he
has
within
himself
the
right
stuff
unless
he
has
energy
courage
the
power
of
insisting
on
his
own
rights
and
the
sympathy
that
makes
him
regardful
of
the
rights
of
others
all
this
individual
morality
i
was
taught
by
the
books
i
read
at
home
and
the
books
i
studied
at
harvard
but
there
was
almost
no
teaching
of
the
need
for
collective
action
and
of
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
not
as
a
substitute
for
individual
responsibility
there
is
a
collective
responsibility
books
such
as
herbert
promise
of
american
life
and
walter
weyl
new
democracy
would
generally
at
that
time
have
been
treated
either
as
unintelligible
or
else
as
pure
heresy
the
teaching
which
i
received
was
genuinely
democratic
in
one
way
it
was
not
so
democratic
in
another
i
grew
into
manhood
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
feeling
that
a
man
must
be
respected
for
what
he
made
of
himself
but
i
had
also
consciously
or
unconsciously
been
taught
that
socially
and
industrially
pretty
much
the
whole
duty
of
the
man
lay
in
thus
making
the
best
of
himself
that
he
should
be
honest
in
his
dealings
with
others
and
charitable
in
the
way
to
the
unfortunate
but
that
it
was
no
part
of
his
business
to
join
with
others
in
trying
to
make
things
better
for
the
many
by
curbing
the
abnormal
and
excessive
development
of
individualism
in
a
few
now
i
do
not
mean
that
this
training
was
by
any
means
all
bad
on
the
contrary
the
insistence
upon
individual
responsibility
was
and
is
and
always
will
be
a
prime
necessity
teaching
of
the
kind
i
absorbed
from
both
my
and
my
surroundings
is
a
healthy
to
the
sentimentality
which
by
complacently
excusing
the
individual
for
all
his
shortcomings
would
finally
hopelessly
weaken
the
spring
of
moral
purpose
it
also
keeps
alive
that
virile
vigor
for
the
lack
of
which
in
the
average
individual
no
possible
perfection
of
law
or
of
community
action
can
ever
atone
but
such
teaching
if
not
corrected
by
other
teaching
means
acquiescence
in
a
riot
of
lawless
business
individualism
which
would
be
quite
as
destructive
to
real
civilization
as
the
lawless
military
individualism
of
the
dark
ages
i
left
college
and
entered
the
big
world
owing
more
than
i
can
express
to
the
training
i
had
received
especially
in
my
own
home
but
with
much
else
also
to
learn
if
i
were
to
become
really
fitted
to
do
my
part
in
the
work
that
lay
ahead
for
the
generation
of
americans
to
which
i
belonged
chapter
ii
the
vigor
of
life
looking
back
a
man
really
has
a
more
objective
feeling
about
himself
as
a
child
than
he
has
about
his
father
or
mother
he
feels
as
if
that
child
were
not
the
present
he
individually
but
an
ancestor
just
as
much
an
ancestor
as
either
of
his
parents
the
saying
that
the
child
is
the
father
to
the
man
may
be
taken
in
a
sense
almost
the
reverse
of
that
usually
given
to
it
the
child
is
father
to
the
man
in
the
sense
that
his
individuality
is
separate
from
the
individuality
of
the
into
which
he
turns
this
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
a
man
can
speak
of
his
childhood
and
early
youth
with
a
sense
of
detachment
having
been
a
sickly
boy
with
no
natural
bodily
prowess
and
having
lived
much
at
home
i
was
at
first
quite
unable
to
hold
my
own
when
thrown
into
contact
with
other
boys
of
rougher
antecedents
i
was
nervous
and
timid
yet
from
reading
of
the
people
i
admired
ranging
from
the
soldiers
of
valley
forge
and
morgan
riflemen
to
the
heroes
of
my
favorite
stories
and
from
hearing
of
the
feats
performed
by
my
southern
forefathers
and
kinsfolk
and
from
knowing
my
father
i
felt
a
great
admiration
for
men
who
were
fearless
and
who
could
hold
their
own
in
the
world
and
i
had
a
great
desire
to
be
like
them
until
i
was
nearly
fourteen
i
let
this
desire
take
no
more
definite
shape
than
then
an
incident
happened
that
did
me
real
good
having
an
attack
of
asthma
i
was
sent
off
by
myself
to
moosehead
lake
on
the
ride
thither
i
encountered
a
couple
of
other
boys
who
were
about
my
own
age
but
very
much
more
competent
and
also
much
more
mischievous
i
have
no
doubt
they
were
boys
but
they
were
boys
they
found
that
i
was
a
foreordained
and
predestined
victim
and
industriously
proceeded
to
make
life
miserable
for
me
the
worst
feature
was
that
when
i
finally
tried
to
fight
them
i
discovered
that
either
one
singly
could
not
only
handle
me
with
easy
contempt
but
handle
me
so
as
not
to
hurt
me
much
and
yet
to
prevent
my
doing
any
damage
whatever
in
return
the
experience
taught
me
what
probably
no
amount
of
good
advice
could
have
taught
me
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
must
try
to
learn
so
that
i
would
not
again
be
put
in
such
a
helpless
position
and
having
become
quickly
and
bitterly
conscious
that
i
did
not
have
the
natural
prowess
to
hold
my
own
i
decided
that
i
would
try
to
supply
its
place
by
training
accordingly
with
my
father
hearty
approval
i
started
to
learn
to
box
i
was
a
painfully
slow
and
awkward
pupil
and
certainly
worked
two
or
three
years
before
i
made
any
perceptible
improvement
whatever
my
first
was
john
long
an
i
can
see
his
rooms
now
with
colored
pictures
of
the
fights
between
tom
hyer
and
yankee
sullivan
and
heenan
and
sayers
and
other
great
events
in
the
annals
of
the
squared
circle
on
one
occasion
to
excite
interest
among
his
patrons
he
held
a
series
of
championship
matches
for
the
different
weights
the
prizes
being
at
least
in
my
own
class
pewter
mugs
of
a
value
i
should
suppose
approximating
fifty
cents
neither
he
nor
i
had
any
idea
that
i
could
do
anything
but
i
was
entered
in
the
lightweight
contest
in
which
it
happened
that
i
was
pitted
in
succession
against
a
couple
of
reedy
striplings
who
were
even
worse
than
i
was
equally
to
their
surprise
and
to
my
own
and
to
john
long
i
won
and
the
pewter
mug
became
one
of
my
most
prized
possessions
i
kept
it
and
alluded
to
it
and
i
fear
bragged
about
it
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
only
wish
i
knew
where
it
was
now
years
later
i
read
an
account
of
a
little
man
who
once
in
a
handicap
race
won
a
worthless
pewter
medal
and
joyed
in
it
ever
after
well
as
soon
as
i
read
that
story
i
felt
that
that
little
man
and
i
were
brothers
this
was
as
far
as
i
remember
the
only
one
of
my
exceedingly
rare
athletic
triumphs
which
would
be
worth
relating
i
did
a
good
deal
of
boxing
and
wrestling
in
harvard
but
never
attained
to
the
first
rank
in
either
even
at
my
own
weight
once
in
the
big
contests
in
the
gym
i
got
either
into
the
finals
or
i
forget
which
but
aside
from
this
the
chief
part
i
played
was
to
act
as
trial
horse
for
some
friend
or
classmate
who
did
have
a
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
in
the
championship
contests
i
was
fond
of
but
i
took
to
it
slowly
and
with
difficulty
exactly
as
with
boxing
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
became
even
a
respectable
rider
and
i
never
got
much
higher
i
mean
by
this
that
i
never
became
a
man
in
the
hunting
field
and
never
even
approached
the
class
in
the
west
any
man
if
he
chooses
can
gradually
school
himself
to
the
requisite
nerve
and
gradually
learn
the
requisite
seat
and
hands
that
will
enable
him
to
do
respectably
across
country
or
to
perform
the
average
work
on
a
ranch
of
my
ranch
experiences
i
shall
speak
later
at
intervals
after
leaving
college
i
hunted
on
long
island
with
the
meadowbrook
hounds
almost
the
only
experience
i
ever
had
in
this
connection
that
was
of
any
interest
was
on
one
occasion
when
i
broke
my
arm
my
purse
did
not
permit
me
to
own
expensive
horses
on
this
occasion
i
was
riding
an
animal
a
buggy
horse
originally
which
its
owner
sold
because
now
and
then
it
insisted
on
thoughtfully
lying
down
when
in
harness
it
never
did
this
under
the
saddle
and
when
he
turned
it
out
to
grass
it
would
solemnly
hop
over
the
fence
and
get
somewhere
where
it
did
not
belong
the
last
trait
was
what
converted
it
into
a
hunter
it
was
a
natural
jumper
although
without
any
speed
on
the
hunt
in
question
i
got
along
very
well
until
the
pace
winded
my
horse
and
it
turned
a
somersault
over
a
fence
when
i
got
on
it
after
the
fall
i
found
i
could
not
use
my
left
arm
i
supposed
it
was
merely
a
strain
the
buggy
horse
was
a
sedate
animal
which
i
rode
with
a
snaffle
so
we
pounded
along
at
the
tail
of
the
hunt
and
i
did
not
appreciate
that
my
arm
was
broken
for
three
or
four
fences
then
we
came
to
a
big
drop
and
the
jar
made
the
bones
slip
past
one
another
so
as
to
throw
the
hand
out
of
position
it
did
not
hurt
me
at
all
and
as
the
horse
was
as
easy
to
sit
as
a
i
got
in
at
the
death
i
think
august
belmont
was
master
of
the
hunt
when
the
above
incident
occurred
i
know
he
was
master
on
another
occasion
on
which
i
met
with
a
mild
adventure
on
one
of
the
hunts
when
i
was
out
a
man
was
thrown
dragged
by
one
stirrup
and
killed
in
consequence
i
bought
a
pair
of
safety
stirrups
which
i
used
the
next
time
i
went
out
within
five
minutes
after
the
run
began
i
found
that
the
stirrups
were
so
very
safe
that
they
would
not
stay
in
at
all
first
one
went
off
at
one
jump
and
then
the
other
at
another
jump
with
a
fall
for
me
on
each
occasion
i
hated
to
give
up
the
fun
so
early
and
accordingly
finished
the
run
without
any
stirrups
my
horse
never
went
as
fast
as
on
that
run
doubtless
a
horseman
can
ride
as
well
without
stirrups
as
with
them
but
i
was
not
a
horseman
when
anything
unexpected
happened
i
was
apt
to
clasp
the
solemn
buggy
horse
firmly
with
my
spurred
heels
and
the
result
was
that
he
laid
himself
out
to
do
his
best
in
the
way
of
galloping
he
speedily
found
that
thanks
to
the
snaffle
bit
i
could
not
pull
him
in
so
when
we
came
to
a
down
grade
he
would
usually
put
on
steam
then
if
there
was
a
fence
at
the
bottom
and
he
checked
at
all
i
was
apt
to
shoot
forward
and
in
such
event
we
went
over
the
fence
in
a
way
that
reminded
me
of
leech
picture
in
of
tom
noddy
and
his
mare
jumping
a
fence
in
the
following
order
tom
noddy
i
his
mare
ii
however
i
got
in
at
the
death
this
time
also
i
was
fond
of
walking
and
climbing
as
a
lad
i
used
to
go
to
the
north
woods
in
maine
both
in
fall
and
winter
there
i
made
life
friends
of
two
men
will
dow
and
bill
sewall
i
canoed
with
them
and
tramped
through
the
woods
with
them
visiting
the
winter
logging
camps
on
afterward
they
were
with
me
in
the
west
will
dow
is
dead
bill
sewall
was
collector
of
customs
under
me
on
the
aroostook
border
except
when
hunting
i
never
did
any
mountaineering
save
for
a
couple
of
conventional
trips
up
the
matterhorn
and
the
jungfrau
on
one
occasion
when
i
was
in
switzerland
i
never
did
much
with
the
shotgun
but
i
practiced
a
good
deal
with
the
rifle
i
had
a
at
sagamore
hill
where
i
often
took
friends
to
shoot
once
or
twice
when
i
was
visited
by
parties
of
released
boer
prisoners
after
the
close
of
the
south
african
war
they
and
i
held
shooting
matches
together
the
best
man
with
both
pistol
and
rifle
who
ever
shot
there
was
stewart
edward
white
among
the
many
other
good
men
was
a
stanch
friend
baron
speck
von
sternberg
afterwards
german
ambassador
at
washington
during
my
presidency
he
was
a
capital
shot
rider
and
walker
a
devoted
and
most
efficient
servant
of
germany
who
had
fought
with
distinction
in
the
war
when
barely
more
than
a
boy
he
was
the
hero
of
the
story
of
the
pig
dog
in
archibald
forbes
volume
of
reminiscences
it
was
he
who
first
talked
over
with
me
the
raising
of
a
regiment
of
horse
riflemen
from
among
the
ranchmen
and
cowboys
of
the
plains
when
ambassador
the
poor
gallant
fellow
was
dying
of
a
slow
and
painful
disease
so
that
he
could
not
play
with
the
rest
of
us
but
the
agony
of
his
mortal
illness
never
in
the
slightest
degree
interfered
with
his
work
among
the
other
men
who
shot
and
rode
and
walked
with
me
was
cecil
who
has
just
been
appointed
british
ambassador
to
the
united
states
he
was
my
groomsman
my
best
man
when
i
was
married
at
george
hanover
square
which
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
living
in
one
of
thackeray
novels
my
own
experience
as
regards
marksmanship
was
much
the
same
as
my
experience
as
regards
horsemanship
there
are
men
whose
eye
and
hand
are
so
quick
and
so
sure
that
they
achieve
a
perfection
of
marksmanship
to
which
no
practice
will
enable
ordinary
men
to
attain
there
are
other
men
who
can
not
learn
to
shoot
with
any
accuracy
at
all
in
between
come
the
mass
of
men
of
ordinary
abilities
who
if
they
choose
resolutely
to
practice
can
by
sheer
industry
and
judgment
make
themselves
fair
rifle
shots
the
men
who
show
this
requisite
industry
and
judgment
can
without
special
difficulty
raise
themselves
to
the
second
class
of
respectable
rifle
shots
and
it
is
to
this
class
that
i
belong
but
to
have
reached
this
point
of
marksmanship
with
the
rifle
at
a
target
by
no
means
implies
ability
to
hit
game
in
the
field
especially
dangerous
game
all
kinds
of
other
qualities
moral
and
physical
enter
into
being
a
good
hunter
and
especially
a
good
hunter
after
dangerous
game
just
as
all
kinds
of
other
qualities
in
addition
to
skill
with
the
rifle
enter
into
being
a
good
soldier
with
dangerous
game
after
a
fair
degree
of
efficiency
with
the
rifle
has
been
attained
the
prime
requisites
are
cool
judgment
and
that
kind
of
nerve
which
consists
in
avoiding
being
rattled
any
beginner
is
apt
to
have
buck
fever
and
therefore
no
beginner
should
go
at
dangerous
game
buck
fever
means
a
state
of
intense
nervous
excitement
which
may
be
entirely
divorced
from
timidity
it
may
affect
a
man
the
first
time
he
has
to
speak
to
a
large
audience
just
as
it
affects
him
the
first
time
he
sees
a
buck
or
goes
into
battle
what
such
a
man
needs
is
not
courage
but
nerve
control
this
he
can
get
only
by
actual
practice
he
must
by
custom
and
repeated
exercise
of
get
his
nerves
thoroughly
under
control
this
is
largely
a
matter
of
habit
in
the
sense
of
repeated
effort
and
repeated
exercise
of
will
power
if
the
man
has
the
right
stuff
in
him
his
will
grows
stronger
and
stronger
with
each
exercise
of
it
and
if
he
has
not
the
right
stuff
in
him
he
had
better
keep
clear
of
dangerous
game
hunting
or
indeed
of
any
other
form
of
sport
or
work
in
which
there
is
bodily
peril
after
he
has
achieved
the
ability
to
exercise
wariness
and
judgment
and
the
control
over
his
nerves
will
make
him
shoot
as
well
at
the
game
as
at
a
he
can
begin
his
essays
at
dangerous
game
hunting
and
he
will
then
find
that
it
does
not
demand
such
abnormal
prowess
as
the
outsider
is
apt
to
imagine
a
man
who
can
hit
a
bottle
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
can
brain
a
lion
or
a
bear
or
an
elephant
at
that
distance
and
if
he
can
not
brain
it
when
it
charges
he
can
at
least
bring
it
to
a
standstill
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
shoot
as
accurately
as
he
would
at
a
bottle
and
to
do
this
requires
nerve
at
least
as
much
as
it
does
physical
address
having
reached
this
point
the
hunter
must
not
imagine
that
he
is
warranted
in
taking
desperate
chances
there
are
degrees
in
proficiency
and
what
is
a
warrantable
and
legitimate
risk
for
a
man
to
take
when
he
has
reached
a
certain
grade
of
efficiency
may
be
a
foolish
risk
for
him
to
take
before
he
has
reached
that
grade
a
man
who
has
reached
the
degree
of
proficiency
indicated
above
is
quite
warranted
in
walking
in
at
a
lion
at
bay
in
an
open
plain
to
say
within
a
hundred
yards
if
the
lion
has
not
charged
the
man
ought
at
that
distance
to
knock
him
over
and
prevent
his
charging
and
if
the
lion
is
already
charging
the
man
ought
at
that
distance
to
be
able
to
stop
him
but
the
amount
of
prowess
which
warrants
a
man
in
relying
on
his
ability
to
perform
this
feat
does
not
by
any
means
justify
him
in
thinking
that
for
instance
he
can
crawl
after
a
wounded
lion
into
thick
cover
i
have
known
men
of
indifferent
prowess
to
perform
this
latter
feat
successfully
but
at
least
as
often
they
have
been
unsuccessful
and
in
these
cases
the
result
has
been
unpleasant
the
man
who
habitually
follows
wounded
lions
into
thick
cover
must
be
a
hunter
of
the
highest
skill
or
he
can
count
with
certainty
on
an
ultimate
mauling
the
first
two
or
three
bucks
i
ever
saw
gave
me
buck
fever
badly
but
after
i
had
gained
experience
with
ordinary
game
i
never
had
buck
fever
at
all
with
dangerous
game
in
my
case
the
overcoming
of
buck
fever
was
the
result
of
conscious
effort
and
a
deliberate
determination
to
overcome
it
more
happily
constituted
men
never
have
to
make
this
determined
effort
at
all
which
may
perhaps
show
that
the
average
man
can
profit
more
from
my
experiences
than
he
can
from
those
of
the
exceptional
man
i
have
shot
only
five
kinds
of
animals
which
can
fairly
be
called
dangerous
game
that
is
the
lion
elephant
rhinoceros
and
buffalo
in
africa
and
the
big
grizzly
bear
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
in
the
rockies
taking
into
account
not
only
my
own
personal
experience
but
the
experiences
of
many
veteran
hunters
i
regard
all
the
four
african
animals
but
especially
the
lion
elephant
and
buffalo
as
much
more
dangerous
than
the
grizzly
as
it
happened
however
the
only
narrow
escape
i
personally
ever
had
was
from
a
grizzly
and
in
africa
the
animal
killed
closest
to
me
as
it
was
charging
was
a
rhinoceros
all
of
which
goes
to
show
that
a
man
must
not
generalize
too
broadly
from
his
own
personal
experiences
on
the
whole
i
think
the
lion
the
most
dangerous
of
all
these
five
animals
that
is
i
think
that
if
fairly
hunted
there
is
a
larger
percentage
of
hunters
killed
or
mauled
for
a
given
number
of
lions
killed
than
for
a
given
number
of
any
one
of
the
other
animals
yet
i
personally
had
no
difficulties
with
lions
i
twice
killed
lions
which
were
at
bay
and
just
starting
to
charge
and
i
killed
a
male
while
it
was
in
full
charge
but
in
each
instance
i
had
plenty
of
leeway
the
animal
being
so
far
off
that
even
if
my
bullet
had
not
been
fatal
i
should
have
had
time
for
a
couple
more
shots
the
african
buffalo
is
undoubtedly
a
dangerous
beast
but
it
happened
that
the
few
that
i
shot
did
not
charge
a
bull
elephant
a
vicious
rogue
which
had
been
killing
people
in
the
native
villages
did
charge
before
being
shot
at
my
son
kermit
and
i
stopped
it
at
forty
yards
another
bull
elephant
also
unwounded
which
charged
nearly
got
me
as
i
had
just
fired
both
cartridges
from
my
heavy
rifle
in
killing
the
bull
i
was
after
the
first
wild
elephant
i
had
ever
seen
the
second
bull
came
through
the
thick
brush
to
my
left
like
a
steam
plow
through
a
light
snowdrift
everything
snapping
before
his
rush
and
was
so
near
that
he
could
have
hit
me
with
his
trunk
i
slipped
past
him
behind
a
tree
people
have
asked
me
how
i
felt
on
this
occasion
my
answer
has
always
been
that
i
suppose
i
felt
as
most
men
of
like
experience
feel
on
such
occasions
at
such
a
moment
a
hunter
is
so
very
busy
that
he
has
no
time
to
get
frightened
he
wants
to
get
in
his
cartridges
and
try
another
shot
rhinoceros
are
truculent
blustering
beasts
much
the
most
stupid
of
all
the
dangerous
game
i
know
generally
their
attitude
is
one
of
mere
stupidity
and
bluff
but
on
occasions
they
do
charge
wickedly
both
when
wounded
and
when
entirely
unprovoked
the
first
i
ever
shot
i
mortally
wounded
at
a
few
rods
distance
and
it
charged
with
the
utmost
determination
whereat
i
and
my
companion
both
fired
and
more
by
good
luck
than
anything
else
brought
it
to
the
ground
just
thirteen
paces
from
where
we
stood
another
rhinoceros
may
or
may
not
have
been
meaning
to
charge
me
i
have
never
been
certain
which
it
heard
us
and
came
at
us
through
rather
thick
brush
snorting
and
tossing
its
head
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
it
had
fixedly
hostile
intentions
and
indeed
with
my
present
experience
i
think
it
likely
that
if
i
had
not
fired
it
would
have
flinched
at
the
last
moment
and
either
retreated
or
gone
by
me
but
i
am
not
a
rhinoceros
mind
reader
and
its
actions
were
such
as
to
warrant
my
regarding
it
as
a
suspicious
character
i
stopped
it
with
a
couple
of
bullets
and
then
followed
it
up
and
killed
it
the
skins
of
all
these
animals
which
i
thus
killed
are
in
the
national
museum
at
washington
but
as
i
said
above
the
only
narrow
escape
i
met
with
was
not
from
one
of
these
dangerous
african
animals
but
from
a
grizzly
bear
it
was
about
years
ago
i
had
wounded
the
bear
just
at
sunset
in
a
wood
of
pines
and
following
him
i
wounded
him
again
as
he
stood
on
the
other
side
of
a
thicket
he
then
charged
through
the
brush
coming
with
such
speed
and
with
such
an
irregular
gait
that
try
as
i
would
i
was
not
able
to
get
the
sight
of
my
rifle
on
the
though
i
hit
him
very
hard
with
both
the
remaining
barrels
of
my
magazine
winchester
it
was
in
the
days
of
black
powder
and
the
smoke
hung
after
my
last
shot
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
bear
left
paw
as
he
struck
at
me
so
close
that
i
made
a
quick
movement
to
one
side
he
was
however
practically
already
dead
and
after
another
jump
and
while
in
the
very
act
of
trying
to
turn
to
come
at
me
he
collapsed
like
a
shot
rabbit
by
the
way
i
had
a
most
exasperating
time
trying
to
bring
in
his
skin
i
was
alone
traveling
on
foot
with
one
very
docile
little
mountain
mare
for
a
pack
pony
the
little
mare
cared
nothing
for
bears
or
anything
else
so
there
was
no
difficulty
in
packing
her
but
the
man
without
experience
can
hardly
realize
the
work
it
was
to
get
that
bearskin
off
the
carcass
and
then
to
pack
it
wet
slippery
and
heavy
so
that
it
would
ride
evenly
on
the
pony
i
was
at
the
time
fairly
well
versed
in
packing
with
a
diamond
hitch
the
standby
of
rocky
mountain
packers
in
my
day
but
the
diamond
hitch
is
a
job
and
even
working
with
a
squaw
hitch
i
got
into
endless
trouble
with
that
wet
and
slippery
bearskin
with
infinite
labor
i
would
get
the
skin
on
the
pony
and
run
the
ropes
over
it
until
to
all
seeming
it
was
fastened
properly
then
off
we
would
start
and
after
going
about
a
hundred
yards
i
would
notice
the
hide
beginning
to
bulge
through
between
two
ropes
i
would
shift
one
of
them
and
then
the
hide
would
bulge
somewhere
else
i
would
shift
the
rope
again
and
still
the
hide
would
flow
slowly
out
as
if
it
was
lava
the
first
thing
i
knew
it
would
come
down
on
one
side
and
the
little
mare
with
her
feet
planted
resolutely
would
wait
for
me
to
perform
my
part
by
getting
that
bearskin
back
in
its
proper
place
on
the
mcclellan
saddle
which
i
was
using
as
a
makeshift
pack
saddle
the
feat
of
killing
the
bear
the
previous
day
sank
into
nothing
compared
with
the
feat
of
making
the
bearskin
ride
properly
as
a
pack
on
the
following
three
days
the
reason
why
i
was
alone
in
the
mountains
on
this
occasion
was
because
for
the
only
time
in
all
my
experience
i
had
a
difficulty
with
my
guide
he
was
a
crippled
old
mountain
man
with
a
profound
contempt
for
tenderfeet
a
contempt
that
in
my
case
was
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
i
wore
spectacles
which
at
that
day
and
in
that
region
were
usually
held
to
indicate
a
defective
moral
character
in
the
wearer
he
had
never
previously
acted
as
guide
or
as
he
expressed
it
trundled
a
tenderfoot
and
though
a
good
hunter
who
showed
me
much
game
our
experience
together
was
not
happy
he
was
very
rheumatic
and
liked
to
lie
abed
late
so
that
i
usually
had
to
get
breakfast
and
in
fact
do
most
of
the
work
around
camp
finally
one
day
he
declined
to
go
out
with
me
saying
that
he
had
a
pain
when
that
afternoon
i
got
back
to
camp
i
speedily
found
what
the
pain
was
we
were
traveling
very
light
indeed
i
having
practically
nothing
but
my
buffalo
my
wash
kit
and
a
pair
of
socks
i
had
also
taken
a
flask
of
whisky
for
emergencies
although
as
i
found
that
the
emergencies
never
arose
and
that
tea
was
better
than
whisky
when
a
man
was
cold
or
done
out
i
abandoned
the
practice
of
taking
whisky
on
hunting
trips
twenty
years
ago
when
i
got
back
to
camp
the
old
fellow
was
sitting
on
a
very
erect
with
his
rifle
across
his
knees
and
in
response
to
my
nod
of
greeting
he
merely
leered
at
me
i
leaned
my
rifle
against
a
tree
walked
over
to
where
my
bed
was
lying
and
happening
to
rummage
in
it
for
something
i
found
the
whisky
flask
was
empty
i
turned
on
him
at
once
and
accused
him
of
having
drunk
it
to
which
he
merely
responded
by
asking
what
i
was
going
to
do
about
it
there
did
not
seem
much
to
do
so
i
said
that
we
would
part
company
we
were
only
four
or
five
days
from
a
settlement
and
i
would
go
in
alone
taking
one
of
the
horses
he
responded
by
cocking
his
rifle
and
saying
that
i
could
go
alone
and
be
damned
to
me
but
i
could
not
take
any
horse
i
answered
all
right
that
if
i
could
not
i
could
not
and
began
to
move
around
to
get
some
flour
and
salt
pork
he
was
misled
by
my
quietness
and
by
the
fact
that
i
had
not
in
any
way
resented
either
his
actions
or
his
language
during
the
days
we
had
been
together
and
did
not
watch
me
as
closely
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
was
sitting
with
the
cocked
rifle
across
his
knees
the
muzzle
to
the
left
my
rifle
was
leaning
against
a
tree
near
the
cooking
things
to
his
right
managing
to
get
near
it
i
whipped
it
up
and
threw
the
bead
on
him
calling
hands
up
he
of
course
put
up
his
hands
and
then
said
oh
come
i
was
only
joking
to
which
i
answered
well
i
am
not
now
straighten
your
legs
and
let
your
rifle
go
to
the
ground
he
remonstrated
saying
the
rifle
would
go
off
and
i
told
him
to
let
it
go
off
however
he
straightened
his
legs
in
such
fashion
that
it
came
to
the
ground
without
a
jar
i
then
made
him
move
back
and
picked
up
the
rifle
by
this
time
he
was
quite
sober
and
really
did
not
seem
angry
looking
at
me
quizzically
he
told
me
that
if
i
would
give
him
back
his
rifle
he
would
call
it
quits
and
we
could
go
on
together
i
did
not
think
it
best
to
trust
him
so
i
told
him
that
our
hunt
was
pretty
well
through
anyway
and
that
i
would
go
home
there
was
a
blasted
pine
on
the
trail
in
plain
view
of
the
camp
about
a
mile
off
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
leave
his
rifle
at
that
blasted
pine
if
i
could
see
him
in
camp
but
that
he
must
not
come
after
me
for
if
he
did
i
should
assume
that
it
was
with
hostile
intent
and
would
shoot
he
said
he
had
no
intention
of
coming
after
me
and
as
he
was
very
much
crippled
with
rheumatism
i
did
not
believe
he
would
do
so
accordingly
i
took
the
little
mare
with
nothing
but
some
flour
bacon
and
tea
and
my
and
started
off
at
the
blasted
pine
i
looked
round
and
as
i
could
see
him
in
camp
i
left
his
rifle
there
i
then
traveled
till
dark
and
that
night
for
the
only
time
in
my
experience
i
used
in
camping
a
trick
of
the
trappers
in
the
indian
days
i
did
not
believe
i
would
be
followed
but
still
it
was
not
possible
to
be
sure
so
after
getting
supper
while
my
pony
fed
round
i
left
the
fire
burning
repacked
the
mare
and
pushed
ahead
until
it
literally
became
so
dark
that
i
could
not
see
then
i
picketed
the
mare
slept
where
i
was
without
a
fire
until
the
first
streak
of
dawn
and
then
pushed
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
before
halting
to
take
breakfast
and
to
let
the
little
mare
have
a
good
feed
no
plainsman
needs
to
be
told
that
a
man
should
not
lie
near
a
fire
if
there
is
danger
of
an
enemy
creeping
up
on
him
and
that
above
all
a
man
should
not
put
himself
in
a
position
where
he
can
be
ambushed
at
dawn
on
this
second
day
i
lost
the
trail
and
toward
nightfall
gave
up
the
effort
to
find
it
camped
where
i
was
and
went
out
to
shoot
a
grouse
for
supper
it
was
while
hunting
in
vain
for
a
grouse
that
i
came
on
the
bear
and
killed
it
as
above
described
when
i
reached
the
settlement
and
went
into
the
store
the
storekeeper
identified
me
by
remarking
you
the
tenderfoot
that
old
hank
was
trundling
ai
you
i
admitted
that
i
was
a
good
many
years
later
after
i
had
been
elected
i
went
on
a
cougar
hunt
in
northwestern
colorado
with
johnny
goff
a
famous
hunter
and
mountain
man
it
was
midwinter
i
was
rather
proud
of
my
achievements
and
pictured
myself
as
being
known
to
the
few
settlers
in
the
neighborhood
as
a
successful
hunter
i
could
not
help
grinning
when
i
found
out
that
they
did
not
even
allude
to
me
as
the
let
alone
as
a
hunter
but
merely
as
johnny
goff
tourist
of
course
during
the
years
when
i
was
most
busy
at
serious
work
i
could
do
no
hunting
and
even
my
riding
was
of
a
decorous
kind
but
a
man
whose
business
is
sedentary
should
get
some
kind
of
exercise
if
he
wishes
to
keep
himself
in
as
good
physical
trim
as
his
brethren
who
do
manual
labor
when
i
worked
on
a
ranch
i
needed
no
form
of
exercise
except
my
work
but
when
i
worked
in
an
office
the
case
was
different
a
couple
of
summers
i
played
polo
with
some
of
my
neighbors
i
shall
always
believe
we
played
polo
in
just
the
right
way
for
men
with
stables
of
the
general
utility
order
of
course
it
was
polo
which
was
chiefly
of
interest
to
ourselves
the
only
onlookers
being
the
members
of
our
faithful
families
my
two
ponies
were
the
only
occupants
of
my
stable
except
a
my
wife
and
i
rode
and
drove
them
and
they
were
used
for
household
errands
and
for
the
children
and
for
two
afternoons
a
week
they
served
me
as
polo
ponies
polo
is
a
good
game
infinitely
better
for
vigorous
men
than
tennis
or
golf
or
anything
of
that
kind
there
is
all
the
fun
of
football
with
the
horse
thrown
in
and
if
only
people
would
be
willing
to
play
it
in
simple
fashion
it
would
be
almost
as
much
within
their
reach
as
golf
but
at
oyster
bay
our
great
and
permanent
amusements
were
rowing
and
sailing
i
do
not
care
for
the
latter
and
am
fond
of
the
former
i
suppose
it
sounds
archaic
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
people
with
motor
boats
miss
a
great
deal
if
they
would
only
keep
to
rowboats
or
canoes
and
use
oar
or
paddle
themselves
they
would
get
infinitely
more
benefit
than
by
having
their
work
done
for
them
by
gasoline
but
i
rarely
took
exercise
merely
as
exercise
primarily
i
took
it
because
i
liked
it
play
should
never
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
work
and
a
life
devoted
merely
to
play
is
of
all
forms
of
existence
the
most
dismal
but
the
joy
of
life
is
a
very
good
thing
and
while
work
is
the
essential
in
it
play
also
has
its
place
when
obliged
to
live
in
cities
i
for
a
long
time
found
that
boxing
and
wrestling
enabled
me
to
get
a
good
deal
of
exercise
in
condensed
and
attractive
form
i
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
abandon
both
as
i
grew
older
i
dropped
the
wrestling
earliest
when
i
became
governor
the
champion
middleweight
wrestler
of
america
happened
to
be
in
albany
and
i
got
him
to
come
round
three
or
four
afternoons
a
week
incidentally
i
may
mention
that
his
presence
caused
me
a
difficulty
with
the
comptroller
who
refused
to
audit
a
bill
i
put
in
for
a
explaining
that
i
could
have
a
billiards
being
recognized
as
a
proper
gubernatorial
amusement
but
that
a
symbolized
something
unusual
and
unheard
of
and
could
not
be
permitted
the
middleweight
champion
was
of
course
so
much
better
than
i
was
that
he
could
not
only
take
care
of
himself
but
of
me
too
and
see
that
i
was
not
hurt
for
wrestling
is
a
much
more
violent
amusement
than
boxing
but
after
a
couple
of
months
he
had
to
go
away
and
he
left
as
a
substitute
a
stalwart
professional
oarsman
the
oarsman
turned
out
to
know
very
little
about
wrestling
he
could
not
even
take
care
of
himself
not
to
speak
of
me
by
the
end
of
our
second
afternoon
one
of
his
long
ribs
had
been
caved
in
and
two
of
my
short
ribs
badly
damaged
and
my
left
so
nearly
shoved
out
of
place
that
it
creaked
he
was
nearly
as
pleased
as
i
was
when
i
told
him
i
thought
we
would
vote
the
war
a
failure
and
abandon
wrestling
after
that
i
took
up
boxing
again
while
president
i
used
to
box
with
some
of
the
aides
as
well
as
play
with
general
wood
after
a
few
years
i
had
to
abandon
boxing
as
well
as
wrestling
for
in
one
bout
a
young
captain
of
artillery
me
on
the
eye
and
the
blow
smashed
the
little
fortunately
it
was
my
left
eye
but
the
sight
has
been
dim
ever
since
and
if
it
had
been
the
right
eye
i
should
have
been
entirely
unable
to
shoot
accordingly
i
thought
it
better
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
become
an
elderly
man
and
would
have
to
stop
boxing
i
then
took
up
for
a
year
or
two
when
i
was
in
the
legislature
and
was
working
very
hard
with
little
chance
of
getting
out
of
doors
all
the
exercise
i
got
was
boxing
and
wrestling
a
young
fellow
turned
up
who
was
a
the
son
of
one
of
my
old
boxing
teachers
for
several
weeks
i
had
him
come
round
to
my
rooms
in
the
morning
to
put
on
the
gloves
with
me
for
half
an
hour
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
some
days
later
i
received
a
letter
of
woe
from
him
from
the
jail
i
found
that
he
was
by
profession
a
burglar
and
merely
followed
boxing
as
the
amusement
of
his
lighter
moments
or
when
business
was
slack
naturally
being
fond
of
boxing
i
grew
to
know
a
good
many
and
to
most
of
those
i
knew
i
grew
genuinely
attached
i
have
never
been
able
to
sympathize
with
the
outcry
against
the
only
objection
i
have
to
the
prize
ring
is
the
crookedness
that
has
attended
its
commercial
development
outside
of
this
i
regard
boxing
whether
professional
or
amateur
as
a
sport
and
i
do
not
regard
it
as
brutalizing
of
course
matches
can
be
conducted
under
conditions
that
make
them
brutalizing
but
this
is
true
of
football
games
and
of
most
other
rough
and
vigorous
sports
most
certainly
is
not
half
as
brutalizing
or
demoralizing
as
many
forms
of
big
business
and
of
the
legal
work
carried
on
in
connection
with
big
business
powerful
vigorous
men
of
strong
animal
development
must
have
some
way
in
which
their
animal
spirits
can
find
vent
when
i
was
police
commissioner
i
found
and
jacob
riis
will
back
me
up
in
this
that
the
establishment
of
a
boxing
club
in
a
tough
neighborhood
always
tended
to
do
away
with
knifing
and
among
the
young
fellows
who
would
otherwise
have
been
in
murderous
gangs
many
of
these
young
fellows
were
not
naturally
criminals
at
all
but
they
had
to
have
some
outlet
for
their
activities
in
the
same
way
i
have
always
regarded
boxing
as
a
sport
to
encourage
in
the
young
men
christian
association
i
do
not
like
to
see
young
christians
with
shoulders
that
slope
like
a
champagne
bottle
of
course
boxing
should
be
encouraged
in
the
army
and
navy
i
was
first
drawn
to
two
naval
chaplains
fathers
chidwick
and
rainey
by
finding
that
each
of
them
had
bought
half
a
dozen
sets
of
and
encouraged
their
crews
in
boxing
when
i
was
police
commissioner
i
heartily
approved
the
effort
to
get
boxing
clubs
started
in
new
york
on
a
clean
basis
later
i
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prize
ring
had
become
hopelessly
debased
and
demoralized
and
as
governor
i
aided
in
the
passage
of
and
signed
the
bill
putting
a
stop
to
professional
boxing
for
money
this
was
because
some
of
the
themselves
were
crooked
while
the
crowd
of
who
attended
and
made
up
and
profited
by
the
matches
had
placed
the
whole
business
on
a
basis
of
commercialism
and
brutality
that
was
intolerable
i
shall
always
maintain
that
boxing
contests
themselves
make
good
healthy
sport
it
is
idle
to
compare
them
with
the
torture
and
death
of
the
wretched
horses
in
is
enough
of
itself
to
blast
the
sport
no
matter
how
great
the
skill
and
prowess
shown
by
the
any
sport
in
which
the
death
and
torture
of
animals
is
made
to
furnish
pleasure
to
the
spectators
is
debasing
there
should
always
be
the
opportunity
provided
in
a
glove
fight
or
fight
to
stop
it
when
one
competitor
is
hopelessly
outclassed
or
too
badly
hammered
but
the
men
who
take
part
in
these
fights
are
hard
as
nails
and
it
is
not
worth
while
to
feel
sentimental
about
their
receiving
punishment
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
not
mind
of
course
the
men
who
look
on
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
up
with
the
gloves
or
without
them
themselves
i
have
scant
use
for
the
type
of
sportsmanship
which
consists
merely
in
looking
on
at
the
feats
of
some
one
else
some
as
good
citizens
as
i
know
are
or
were
take
mike
donovan
of
new
york
he
and
his
family
represent
a
type
of
american
citizenship
of
which
we
have
a
right
to
be
proud
mike
is
a
devoted
temperance
man
and
can
be
relied
upon
for
every
movement
in
the
interest
of
good
citizenship
i
was
first
intimately
thrown
with
him
when
i
was
police
commissioner
one
evening
he
and
i
both
in
dress
suits
attended
a
temperance
meeting
of
catholic
societies
it
culminated
in
a
lively
between
myself
and
a
tammany
senator
who
was
a
very
good
fellow
but
whose
ideas
of
temperance
differed
radically
from
mine
and
as
the
event
proved
from
those
of
the
majority
of
the
meeting
mike
evidently
regarded
himself
as
my
backer
he
was
sitting
on
the
platform
beside
me
and
i
think
felt
as
pleased
and
interested
as
if
the
had
been
physical
instead
of
merely
verbal
afterward
i
grew
to
know
him
well
both
while
i
was
governor
and
while
i
was
president
and
many
a
time
he
came
on
and
boxed
with
me
battling
nelson
was
another
stanch
friend
and
he
and
i
think
alike
on
most
questions
of
political
and
industrial
life
although
he
once
expressed
to
me
some
commiseration
because
as
president
i
did
not
get
anything
like
the
money
return
for
my
services
that
he
aggregated
during
the
same
term
of
years
in
the
ring
bob
fitzsimmons
was
another
good
friend
of
mine
he
has
never
forgotten
his
early
skill
as
a
blacksmith
and
among
the
things
that
i
value
and
always
keep
in
use
is
a
penholder
made
by
bob
out
of
a
horseshoe
with
an
inscription
saying
that
it
is
made
for
and
presented
to
president
theodore
roosevelt
by
his
friend
and
admirer
robert
fitzsimmons
i
have
for
a
long
time
had
the
friendship
of
john
sullivan
than
whom
in
his
prime
no
better
man
ever
stepped
into
the
ring
he
is
now
a
massachusetts
farmer
john
used
occasionally
to
visit
me
at
the
white
house
his
advent
always
causing
a
distinct
flutter
among
the
waiting
senators
and
congressmen
when
i
went
to
africa
he
presented
me
with
a
rabbit
foot
for
luck
i
carried
it
through
my
african
trip
and
i
certainly
had
good
luck
on
one
occasion
one
of
my
friends
called
on
me
at
the
white
house
on
business
he
explained
that
he
wished
to
see
me
alone
sat
down
opposite
me
and
put
a
very
expensive
cigar
on
the
desk
saying
have
a
cigar
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
did
not
smoke
to
which
he
responded
put
it
in
your
pocket
he
then
added
take
another
put
both
in
your
pocket
this
i
accordingly
did
having
thus
shown
at
the
outset
the
necessary
formal
courtesy
my
visitor
an
old
and
valued
friend
proceeded
to
explain
that
a
nephew
of
his
had
enlisted
in
the
marine
corps
but
had
been
absent
without
leave
and
was
threatened
with
dishonorable
discharge
on
the
ground
of
desertion
my
visitor
a
good
citizen
and
a
patriotic
american
was
stung
to
the
quick
at
the
thought
of
such
an
incident
occurring
in
his
family
and
he
explained
to
me
that
it
must
not
occur
that
there
must
not
be
the
disgrace
to
the
family
although
he
would
be
delighted
to
have
the
offender
handled
rough
to
teach
him
a
needed
lesson
he
added
that
he
wished
i
would
take
him
and
handle
him
myself
for
he
knew
that
i
would
see
that
he
got
all
that
was
coming
to
him
then
a
look
of
pathos
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
explained
that
boy
i
just
can
not
understand
he
was
my
favorite
son
and
i
always
took
a
special
interest
in
him
myself
i
did
my
best
to
bring
him
up
the
way
he
ought
to
go
but
there
was
just
nothing
to
be
done
with
him
his
tastes
were
naturally
low
he
took
to
music
what
form
this
debasing
taste
for
music
assumed
i
did
not
inquire
and
i
was
able
to
grant
my
friend
wish
while
in
the
white
house
i
always
tried
to
get
a
couple
of
exercise
in
the
afternoons
sometimes
tennis
more
often
riding
or
else
a
rough
walk
perhaps
down
rock
creek
which
was
then
as
wild
as
a
stream
in
the
white
mountains
or
on
the
virginia
side
along
the
potomac
my
companions
at
tennis
or
on
these
rides
and
walks
we
gradually
grew
to
style
the
tennis
cabinet
and
then
we
extended
the
term
to
take
in
many
of
my
western
friends
such
as
ben
daniels
seth
bullock
luther
kelly
and
others
who
had
taken
part
with
me
in
more
serious
outdoor
adventures
than
walking
and
riding
for
pleasure
most
of
the
men
who
were
oftenest
with
me
on
these
trips
men
like
leonard
wood
or
thomas
henry
barry
or
presley
marion
rixey
of
the
navy
or
robert
bacon
who
was
afterwards
secretary
of
state
or
james
garfield
who
was
secretary
of
the
interior
or
gifford
pinchot
who
was
chief
of
the
forest
service
were
better
men
physically
than
i
was
but
i
could
ride
and
walk
well
enough
for
us
all
thoroughly
to
enjoy
it
often
especially
in
the
winters
and
early
springs
we
would
arrange
for
a
point
to
point
walk
not
turning
aside
for
anything
for
instance
swimming
rock
creek
or
even
the
potomac
if
it
came
in
our
way
of
course
under
such
circumstances
we
had
to
arrange
that
our
return
to
washington
should
be
when
it
was
dark
so
that
our
appearance
might
scandalize
no
one
on
several
occasions
we
thus
swam
rock
creek
in
the
early
spring
when
the
ice
was
floating
thick
upon
it
if
we
swam
the
potomac
we
usually
took
off
our
clothes
i
remember
one
such
occasion
when
the
french
ambassador
jusserand
who
was
a
member
of
the
tennis
cabinet
was
along
and
just
as
we
were
about
to
get
in
to
swim
somebody
said
mr
ambassador
mr
ambassador
you
have
taken
off
your
gloves
to
which
he
promptly
responded
i
think
i
will
leave
them
on
we
might
meet
ladies
we
liked
rock
creek
for
these
walks
because
we
could
do
so
much
scrambling
and
climbing
along
the
cliffs
there
was
almost
as
much
climbing
when
we
walked
down
the
potomac
to
washington
from
the
virginia
end
of
the
chain
bridge
i
would
occasionally
take
some
friend
from
abroad
selous
or
george
littledale
or
captain
radclyffe
or
paul
niedicke
on
these
walks
once
i
invited
an
entire
class
of
officers
who
were
attending
lectures
at
the
war
college
to
come
on
one
of
these
walks
i
chose
a
route
which
gave
us
the
hardest
climbing
along
the
rocks
and
the
deepest
crossings
of
the
creek
and
my
army
friends
enjoyed
it
hugely
being
the
right
sort
to
a
man
on
march
three
days
before
leaving
the
presidency
various
members
of
the
tennis
cabinet
lunched
with
me
at
the
white
house
tennis
cabinet
was
an
elastic
term
and
of
course
many
who
ought
to
have
been
at
the
lunch
were
for
one
reason
or
another
away
from
washington
but
to
make
up
for
this
a
goodly
number
of
honorary
members
so
to
speak
were
present
for
instance
seth
bullock
luther
kelly
better
known
as
yellowstone
kelly
in
the
days
when
he
was
an
army
scout
against
the
sioux
and
abernathy
the
at
the
end
of
the
lunch
seth
bullock
suddenly
reached
forward
swept
aside
a
mass
of
flowers
which
made
a
centerpiece
on
the
table
and
revealed
a
bronze
cougar
by
proctor
which
was
a
parting
gift
to
me
the
lunch
party
and
the
cougar
were
then
photographed
on
the
lawn
some
of
the
younger
officers
who
were
my
constant
companions
on
these
walks
and
rides
pointed
out
to
me
the
condition
of
utter
physical
worthlessness
into
which
certain
of
the
elder
ones
had
permitted
themselves
to
lapse
and
the
very
bad
effect
this
would
certainly
have
if
ever
the
army
were
called
into
service
i
then
looked
into
the
matter
for
myself
and
was
really
shocked
at
what
i
found
many
of
the
older
officers
were
so
unfit
physically
that
their
condition
would
have
excited
laughter
had
it
not
been
so
serious
to
think
that
they
belonged
to
the
military
arm
of
the
government
a
cavalry
colonel
proved
unable
to
keep
his
horse
at
a
smart
trot
for
even
half
a
mile
when
i
visited
his
post
a
proved
afraid
even
to
let
his
horse
canter
when
he
went
on
a
ride
with
us
and
certain
otherwise
good
men
proved
as
unable
to
walk
as
if
they
had
been
sedentary
brokers
i
consulted
with
men
like
wood
and
bell
who
were
themselves
of
fine
physique
with
bodies
fit
to
meet
any
demand
it
was
late
in
my
administration
and
we
deemed
it
best
only
to
make
a
beginning
experience
teaches
the
most
inveterate
reformer
how
hard
it
is
to
get
a
totally
nation
to
accept
seriously
any
military
improvement
accordingly
i
merely
issued
directions
that
each
officer
should
prove
his
ability
to
walk
fifty
miles
or
ride
one
hundred
in
three
days
this
is
of
course
a
test
which
many
a
healthy
woman
would
be
able
to
meet
but
a
large
portion
of
the
press
adopted
the
view
that
it
was
a
bit
of
capricious
tyranny
on
my
part
and
a
considerable
number
of
elderly
officers
with
desk
rather
than
field
experience
intrigued
with
their
friends
in
congress
to
have
the
order
annulled
so
one
day
i
took
a
ride
of
a
little
over
one
hundred
miles
myself
in
company
with
rixey
and
two
other
officers
the
virginia
roads
were
frozen
and
in
ruts
and
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
there
was
a
storm
of
snow
and
sleet
and
when
it
had
been
thus
experimentally
shown
under
unfavorable
conditions
how
easy
it
was
to
do
in
one
day
the
task
for
which
the
army
officers
were
allowed
three
days
all
open
objection
ceased
but
some
bureau
chiefs
still
did
as
much
underhanded
work
against
the
order
as
they
dared
and
it
was
often
difficult
to
reach
them
in
the
marine
corps
captain
leonard
who
had
lost
an
arm
at
tientsin
with
two
of
his
lieutenants
did
the
fifty
miles
in
one
day
for
they
were
vigorous
young
men
who
laughed
at
the
idea
of
treating
a
walk
as
well
the
navy
department
officials
rebuked
them
and
made
them
take
the
walk
over
again
in
three
days
on
the
ground
that
taking
it
in
one
day
did
not
comply
with
the
regulations
this
seems
unbelievable
but
leonard
assures
me
it
is
true
he
did
not
inform
me
at
the
time
being
afraid
to
get
in
wrong
with
his
permanent
superiors
if
i
had
known
of
the
order
short
work
would
have
been
made
of
the
bureaucrat
who
issued
it
one
of
our
best
naval
officers
sent
me
the
following
letter
after
the
above
had
appeared
i
note
in
your
autobiography
now
being
published
in
the
outlook
that
you
refer
to
the
reasons
which
led
you
to
establish
a
physical
test
for
the
army
and
to
the
action
you
took
your
ride
to
prevent
the
test
being
abolished
doubtless
you
did
not
know
the
following
facts
the
first
annual
navy
test
of
miles
in
three
days
was
subsequently
reduced
to
miles
in
two
days
in
each
quarter
this
was
further
reduced
to
miles
each
month
which
is
the
present
and
there
is
danger
lest
even
this
utterly
insufficient
test
be
abolished
i
enclose
a
copy
of
a
recent
letter
to
the
surgeon
general
which
will
show
our
present
deplorable
condition
and
the
worse
condition
into
which
we
are
slipping
back
the
original
test
of
miles
in
three
days
did
a
very
great
deal
of
good
it
decreased
by
thousands
of
dollars
the
money
expended
on
street
car
fare
and
by
a
much
greater
sum
the
amount
expended
over
the
bar
it
eliminated
a
number
of
the
wholly
unfit
it
taught
officers
to
walk
it
forced
them
to
learn
the
care
of
their
feet
and
that
of
their
men
and
it
improved
their
general
health
and
was
rapidly
forming
a
taste
for
physical
exercise
the
enclosed
letter
ran
in
part
as
follows
i
am
returning
under
separate
cover
soldiers
foot
and
the
military
shoe
the
book
contains
knowledge
of
a
practical
character
that
is
valuable
for
the
men
who
have
to
march
who
have
suffered
from
foot
troubles
and
who
must
avoid
them
in
order
to
attain
efficiency
the
words
in
capitals
express
according
to
my
idea
the
gist
of
the
whole
matter
as
regards
military
men
the
army
officer
whose
men
break
down
on
test
gets
a
black
eye
the
one
whose
men
show
efficiency
in
this
respect
gets
a
bouquet
to
such
men
the
book
is
invaluable
there
is
no
danger
that
they
will
neglect
it
they
will
actually
learn
it
for
exactly
the
same
reasons
that
our
fellows
learn
the
gunnery
instructions
or
did
learn
them
before
they
were
withdrawn
and
burned
b
u
t
i
have
not
been
able
to
interest
a
single
naval
officer
in
this
fine
book
they
will
look
at
the
pictures
and
say
it
is
a
good
book
but
they
wo
read
it
the
marine
officers
on
the
contrary
are
very
much
interested
because
they
have
to
teach
their
men
to
care
for
their
feet
and
they
must
know
how
to
care
for
their
own
but
the
naval
officers
feel
no
such
necessity
simply
because
their
men
do
not
have
to
demonstrate
their
efficiency
by
practice
marches
and
they
themselves
do
not
have
to
do
a
stunt
that
will
show
up
their
own
ignorance
and
inefficiency
in
the
matter
for
example
some
time
ago
i
was
talking
with
some
chaps
about
shoes
the
necessity
of
having
them
long
enough
and
wide
enough
and
one
of
them
said
have
no
use
for
such
shoes
as
i
never
walk
except
when
i
have
to
and
any
old
shoes
do
for
the
stunt
so
there
you
are
when
the
first
test
was
ordered
edmonston
washington
shoe
man
told
me
that
he
sold
more
real
walking
shoes
to
naval
officers
in
three
months
than
he
had
in
the
three
preceding
years
i
know
three
officers
who
lost
both
nails
after
the
first
test
and
another
who
walked
nine
miles
in
practice
with
a
pair
of
heavy
walking
shoes
that
were
too
small
and
was
laid
up
for
three
days
could
not
come
to
the
office
i
know
plenty
of
men
who
after
the
first
test
had
to
borrow
shoes
from
larger
men
until
their
feet
down
to
their
normal
size
this
test
may
have
been
a
bit
too
strenuous
for
old
hearts
of
men
who
had
never
taken
any
exercise
but
it
was
excellent
as
a
matter
of
instruction
and
training
of
handling
feet
and
in
an
emergency
such
as
we
soon
may
have
in
mexico
sound
hearts
are
not
much
good
if
the
feet
stand
however
the
test
in
two
days
each
quarter
answered
the
same
purpose
for
the
reason
that
miles
will
produce
sore
feet
with
bad
shoes
and
sore
feet
and
lame
muscles
even
with
good
shoes
if
there
has
been
no
practice
marching
it
was
the
necessity
of
doing
more
miles
on
the
second
day
with
sore
feet
and
lame
muscles
that
made
sit
up
and
take
notice
made
practice
walking
made
avoid
street
cars
buy
proper
shoes
show
some
curiosity
about
sox
and
the
care
of
the
feet
in
general
all
this
passed
out
with
the
introduction
of
the
last
test
of
miles
a
month
as
one
fellow
said
can
do
that
in
sneakers
but
he
could
if
the
second
day
involved
a
tramp
on
the
sore
feet
the
point
is
that
whereas
formerly
officers
had
to
practice
walking
a
bit
and
give
some
attention
to
proper
footgear
now
they
do
have
to
and
the
natural
consequence
is
that
they
do
do
it
there
are
plenty
of
officers
who
do
not
walk
any
more
than
is
necessary
to
reach
a
street
car
that
will
carry
them
from
their
residences
to
their
offices
some
who
have
motors
do
not
do
so
much
they
take
no
exercise
they
take
cocktails
instead
and
are
getting
beefy
and
and
something
should
be
done
to
remedy
this
state
of
affairs
it
would
not
be
necessary
if
service
opinion
required
officers
so
to
order
their
lives
that
it
would
be
common
knowledge
that
they
were
in
order
to
avoid
the
danger
of
being
selected
out
we
have
no
such
service
opinion
and
it
is
not
in
process
of
formation
on
the
contrary
it
is
known
that
the
dignitaries
unanimously
advised
the
secretary
to
abandon
all
physical
tests
he
a
civilian
was
wise
enough
not
to
take
the
advice
i
would
like
to
see
a
test
established
that
would
oblige
officers
to
take
sufficient
exercise
to
pass
it
without
inconvenience
for
the
reasons
given
above
miles
in
two
days
every
other
month
would
do
the
business
while
miles
each
month
does
not
touch
it
simply
because
nobody
has
to
walk
on
day
feet
as
for
the
proposed
test
of
so
many
hours
a
week
the
flat
foots
of
the
pendulous
belly
muscles
are
delighted
they
are
looking
into
the
question
of
pedometers
and
will
hang
one
of
these
on
their
wheezy
chests
and
let
it
count
every
shuffling
step
they
take
out
of
doors
if
we
had
an
adequate
test
throughout
years
there
would
at
the
end
of
that
time
be
few
if
any
sacks
of
blubber
at
the
upper
end
of
the
list
and
service
opinion
against
that
sort
of
thing
would
be
established
these
tests
were
kept
during
my
administration
they
were
afterwards
abandoned
not
through
perversity
or
viciousness
but
through
weakness
and
inability
to
understand
the
need
of
preparedness
in
advance
if
the
emergencies
of
war
are
to
be
properly
met
when
or
if
they
arrive
in
no
country
with
an
army
worth
calling
such
is
there
a
chance
for
a
man
physically
unfit
to
stay
in
the
service
our
countrymen
should
understand
that
every
army
officer
and
every
marine
officer
ought
to
be
summarily
removed
from
the
service
unless
he
is
able
to
undergo
far
severer
tests
than
those
which
as
a
beginning
i
imposed
to
follow
any
other
course
is
to
put
a
premium
on
slothful
incapacity
and
to
do
the
gravest
wrong
to
the
nation
i
have
mentioned
all
these
experiences
and
i
could
mention
scores
of
others
because
out
of
them
grew
my
philosophy
perhaps
they
were
in
part
caused
by
my
philosophy
of
bodily
vigor
as
a
method
of
getting
that
vigor
of
soul
without
which
vigor
of
the
body
counts
for
nothing
the
dweller
in
cities
has
less
chance
than
the
dweller
in
the
country
to
keep
his
body
sound
and
vigorous
but
he
can
do
so
if
only
he
will
take
the
trouble
any
young
lawyer
shopkeeper
or
clerk
or
can
keep
himself
in
good
condition
if
he
tries
some
of
the
best
men
who
have
ever
served
under
me
in
the
national
guard
and
in
my
regiment
were
former
clerks
or
why
johnny
hayes
the
marathon
victor
and
at
one
time
world
champion
one
of
my
valued
friends
and
supporters
was
a
in
bloomingdale
big
department
store
surely
with
johnny
hayes
as
an
example
any
young
man
in
a
city
can
hope
to
make
his
body
all
that
a
vigorous
man
body
should
be
i
once
made
a
speech
to
which
i
gave
the
title
the
strenuous
life
afterwards
i
published
a
volume
of
essays
with
this
for
a
title
there
were
two
translations
of
it
which
always
especially
pleased
me
one
was
by
a
japanese
officer
who
knew
english
well
and
who
had
carried
the
essay
all
through
the
manchurian
campaign
and
later
translated
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
countrymen
the
other
was
by
an
italian
lady
whose
brother
an
officer
in
the
italian
army
who
had
died
on
duty
in
a
foreign
land
had
also
greatly
liked
the
article
and
carried
it
round
with
him
in
translating
the
title
the
lady
rendered
it
in
italian
as
di
i
thought
this
translation
a
great
improvement
on
the
original
and
have
always
wished
that
i
had
myself
used
the
vigor
of
life
as
a
heading
to
indicate
what
i
was
trying
to
preach
instead
of
the
heading
i
actually
did
use
there
are
two
kinds
of
success
or
rather
two
kinds
of
ability
displayed
in
the
achievement
of
success
there
is
first
the
success
either
in
big
things
or
small
things
which
comes
to
the
man
who
has
in
him
the
natural
power
to
do
what
no
one
else
can
do
and
what
no
amount
of
training
no
perseverance
or
will
power
will
enable
any
ordinary
man
to
do
this
success
of
course
like
every
other
kind
of
success
may
be
on
a
very
big
scale
or
on
a
small
scale
the
quality
which
the
man
possesses
may
be
that
which
enables
him
to
run
a
hundred
yards
in
nine
and
seconds
or
to
play
ten
separate
games
of
chess
at
the
same
time
blindfolded
or
to
add
five
columns
of
figures
at
once
without
effort
or
to
write
the
ode
to
a
grecian
urn
or
to
deliver
the
gettysburg
speech
or
to
show
the
ability
of
frederick
at
leuthen
or
nelson
at
trafalgar
no
amount
of
training
of
body
or
mind
would
enable
any
good
ordinary
man
to
perform
any
one
of
these
feats
of
course
the
proper
performance
of
each
implies
much
previous
study
or
training
but
in
no
one
of
them
is
success
to
be
attained
save
by
the
altogether
exceptional
man
who
has
in
him
the
something
additional
which
the
ordinary
man
does
not
have
this
is
the
most
striking
kind
of
success
and
it
can
be
attained
only
by
the
man
who
has
in
him
the
quality
which
separates
him
in
kind
no
less
than
in
degree
from
his
fellows
but
much
the
commoner
type
of
success
in
every
walk
of
life
and
in
every
species
of
effort
is
that
which
comes
to
the
man
who
differs
from
his
fellows
not
by
the
kind
of
quality
which
he
possesses
but
by
the
degree
of
development
which
he
has
given
that
quality
this
kind
of
success
is
open
to
a
large
number
of
persons
if
only
they
seriously
determine
to
achieve
it
it
is
the
kind
of
success
which
is
open
to
the
average
man
of
sound
body
and
fair
mind
who
has
no
remarkable
mental
or
physical
attributes
but
who
gets
just
as
much
as
possible
in
the
way
of
work
out
of
the
aptitudes
that
he
does
possess
it
is
the
only
kind
of
success
that
is
open
to
most
of
us
yet
some
of
the
greatest
successes
in
history
have
been
those
of
this
second
class
when
i
call
it
second
class
i
am
not
running
it
down
in
the
least
i
am
merely
pointing
out
that
it
differs
in
kind
from
the
first
class
to
the
average
man
it
is
probably
more
useful
to
study
this
second
type
of
success
than
to
study
the
first
from
the
study
of
the
first
he
can
learn
inspiration
he
can
get
uplift
and
lofty
enthusiasm
from
the
study
of
the
second
he
can
if
he
chooses
find
out
how
to
win
a
similar
success
himself
i
need
hardly
say
that
all
the
successes
i
have
ever
won
have
been
of
the
second
type
i
never
won
anything
without
hard
labor
and
the
exercise
of
my
best
judgment
and
careful
planning
and
working
long
in
advance
having
been
a
rather
sickly
and
awkward
boy
i
was
as
a
young
man
at
first
both
nervous
and
distrustful
of
my
own
prowess
i
had
to
train
myself
painfully
and
laboriously
not
merely
as
regards
my
body
but
as
regards
my
soul
and
spirit
when
a
boy
i
read
a
passage
in
one
of
marryat
books
which
always
impressed
me
in
this
passage
the
captain
of
some
small
british
is
explaining
to
the
hero
how
to
acquire
the
quality
of
fearlessness
he
says
that
at
the
outset
almost
every
man
is
frightened
when
he
goes
into
action
but
that
the
course
to
follow
is
for
the
man
to
keep
such
a
grip
on
himself
that
he
can
act
just
as
if
he
was
not
frightened
after
this
is
kept
up
long
enough
it
changes
from
pretense
to
reality
and
the
man
does
in
very
fact
become
fearless
by
sheer
dint
of
practicing
fearlessness
when
he
does
not
feel
it
i
am
using
my
own
language
not
marryat
this
was
the
theory
upon
which
i
went
there
were
all
kinds
of
things
of
which
i
was
afraid
at
first
ranging
from
grizzly
bears
to
mean
horses
and
but
by
acting
as
if
i
was
not
afraid
i
gradually
ceased
to
be
afraid
most
men
can
have
the
same
experience
if
they
choose
they
will
first
learn
to
bear
themselves
well
in
trials
which
they
anticipate
and
which
they
school
themselves
in
advance
to
meet
after
a
while
the
habit
will
grow
on
them
and
they
will
behave
well
in
sudden
and
unexpected
emergencies
which
come
upon
them
unawares
it
is
of
course
much
pleasanter
if
one
is
naturally
fearless
and
i
envy
and
respect
the
men
who
are
naturally
fearless
but
it
is
a
good
thing
to
remember
that
the
man
who
does
not
enjoy
this
advantage
can
nevertheless
stand
beside
the
man
who
does
and
can
do
his
duty
with
the
like
efficiency
if
he
chooses
to
of
course
he
must
not
let
his
desire
take
the
form
merely
of
a
let
him
dream
about
being
a
fearless
man
and
the
more
he
dreams
the
better
he
will
be
always
provided
he
does
his
best
to
realize
the
dream
in
practice
he
can
do
his
part
honorably
and
well
provided
only
he
sets
fearlessness
before
himself
as
an
ideal
schools
himself
to
think
of
danger
merely
as
something
to
be
faced
and
overcome
and
regards
life
itself
as
he
should
regard
it
not
as
something
to
be
thrown
away
but
as
a
pawn
to
be
promptly
hazarded
whenever
the
hazard
is
warranted
by
the
larger
interests
of
the
great
game
in
which
we
are
all
engaged
chapter
iii
practical
politics
when
i
left
harvard
i
took
up
the
study
of
law
if
i
had
been
sufficiently
fortunate
to
come
under
professor
thayer
of
the
harvard
law
school
it
may
well
be
that
i
would
have
realized
that
the
lawyer
can
do
a
great
work
for
justice
and
against
legalism
but
doubtless
chiefly
through
my
own
fault
some
of
the
teaching
of
the
law
books
and
of
the
classroom
seemed
to
me
to
be
against
justice
the
side
of
the
law
like
the
side
of
business
seemed
to
me
repellent
it
did
not
make
for
social
fair
dealing
the
let
the
buyer
beware
maxim
when
translated
into
actual
practice
whether
in
law
or
business
tends
to
translate
itself
further
into
the
seller
making
his
profit
at
the
expense
of
the
buyer
instead
of
by
a
bargain
which
shall
be
to
the
profit
of
both
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
the
law
was
framed
to
discourage
as
it
should
sharp
practice
and
all
other
kinds
of
bargains
except
those
which
are
fair
and
of
benefit
to
both
sides
i
was
young
there
was
much
in
the
judgment
which
i
then
formed
on
this
matter
which
i
should
now
revise
but
then
as
now
many
of
the
big
corporation
lawyers
to
whom
the
ordinary
members
of
the
bar
then
as
now
looked
up
held
certain
standards
which
were
difficult
to
recognize
as
compatible
with
the
idealism
i
suppose
every
young
man
is
apt
to
feel
if
i
had
been
obliged
to
earn
every
cent
i
spent
i
should
have
gone
into
the
business
of
making
both
ends
meet
and
should
have
taken
up
the
law
or
any
other
respectable
occupation
for
i
then
held
and
now
hold
the
belief
that
a
man
first
duty
is
to
pull
his
own
weight
and
to
take
care
of
those
dependent
upon
him
and
i
then
believed
and
now
believe
that
the
greatest
privilege
and
greatest
duty
for
any
man
is
to
be
happily
married
and
that
no
other
form
of
success
or
service
for
either
man
or
woman
can
be
wisely
accepted
as
a
substitute
or
alternative
but
it
happened
that
i
had
been
left
enough
money
by
my
father
not
to
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
think
solely
of
earning
bread
for
myself
and
my
family
i
had
enough
to
get
bread
what
i
had
to
do
if
i
wanted
butter
and
jam
was
to
provide
the
butter
and
jam
but
to
count
their
cost
as
compared
with
other
things
in
other
words
i
made
up
my
mind
that
while
i
must
earn
money
i
could
afford
to
make
earning
money
the
secondary
instead
of
the
primary
object
of
my
career
if
i
had
had
no
money
at
all
then
my
first
duty
would
have
been
to
earn
it
in
any
honest
fashion
as
i
had
some
money
i
felt
that
my
need
for
more
money
was
to
be
treated
as
a
secondary
need
and
that
while
it
was
my
business
to
make
more
money
where
i
legitimately
and
properly
could
yet
that
it
was
also
my
business
to
treat
other
kinds
of
work
as
more
important
than
almost
immediately
after
leaving
harvard
in
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
politics
i
did
not
then
believe
and
i
do
not
now
believe
that
any
man
should
ever
attempt
to
make
politics
his
only
career
it
is
a
dreadful
misfortune
for
a
man
to
grow
to
feel
that
his
whole
livelihood
and
whole
happiness
depend
upon
his
staying
in
office
such
a
feeling
prevents
him
from
being
of
real
service
to
the
people
while
in
office
and
always
puts
him
under
the
heaviest
strain
of
pressure
to
barter
his
convictions
for
the
sake
of
holding
office
a
man
should
have
some
other
occupation
i
had
several
other
occupations
to
which
he
can
resort
if
at
any
time
he
is
thrown
out
of
office
or
if
at
any
time
he
finds
it
necessary
to
choose
a
course
which
will
probably
result
in
his
being
thrown
out
unless
he
is
willing
to
stay
in
at
cost
to
his
conscience
at
that
day
in
a
young
man
of
my
bringing
up
and
convictions
could
join
only
the
republican
party
and
join
it
i
accordingly
did
it
was
no
simple
thing
to
join
it
then
that
was
long
before
the
era
of
ballot
reform
and
the
control
of
primaries
long
before
the
era
when
we
realized
that
the
government
must
take
official
notice
of
the
deeds
and
acts
of
party
organizations
the
party
was
still
treated
as
a
private
corporation
and
in
each
district
the
organization
formed
a
kind
of
social
and
political
club
a
man
had
to
be
regularly
proposed
for
and
elected
into
this
club
just
as
into
any
other
club
as
a
friend
of
mine
picturesquely
phrased
it
i
had
to
break
into
the
organization
with
a
jimmy
under
these
circumstances
there
was
some
difficulty
in
joining
the
local
organization
and
considerable
amusement
and
excitement
to
be
obtained
out
of
it
after
i
had
joined
it
was
over
years
ago
that
i
thus
became
a
member
of
the
district
republican
association
in
the
city
of
new
york
the
men
i
knew
best
were
the
men
in
the
clubs
of
social
pretension
and
the
men
of
cultivated
taste
and
easy
life
when
i
began
to
make
inquiries
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
local
republican
association
and
the
means
of
joining
it
these
men
and
the
big
business
men
and
lawyers
also
laughed
at
me
and
told
me
that
politics
were
low
that
the
organizations
were
not
controlled
by
gentlemen
that
i
would
find
them
run
by
conductors
and
the
like
and
not
by
men
with
any
of
whom
i
would
come
in
contact
outside
and
moreover
they
assured
me
that
the
men
i
met
would
be
rough
and
brutal
and
unpleasant
to
deal
with
i
answered
that
if
this
were
so
it
merely
meant
that
the
people
i
knew
did
not
belong
to
the
governing
class
and
that
the
other
people
did
and
that
i
intended
to
be
one
of
the
governing
class
that
if
they
proved
too
for
me
i
supposed
i
would
have
to
quit
but
that
i
certainly
would
not
quit
until
i
had
made
the
effort
and
found
out
whether
i
really
was
too
weak
to
hold
my
own
in
the
rough
and
tumble
the
republican
association
of
which
i
became
a
member
held
its
meetings
in
morton
hall
a
large
room
over
a
saloon
its
furniture
was
of
the
canonical
kind
dingy
benches
spittoons
a
dais
at
one
end
with
a
table
and
chair
and
a
stout
pitcher
for
iced
water
and
on
the
walls
pictures
of
general
grant
and
of
levi
morton
to
whose
generosity
we
owed
the
room
we
had
regular
meetings
once
or
twice
a
month
and
between
times
the
place
was
treated
at
least
on
certain
nights
as
a
kind
of
i
went
around
there
often
enough
to
have
the
men
get
accustomed
to
me
and
to
have
me
get
accustomed
to
them
so
that
we
began
to
speak
the
same
language
and
so
that
each
could
begin
to
live
down
in
the
other
mind
what
bret
harte
has
called
the
defective
moral
quality
of
being
a
stranger
it
is
not
often
that
a
man
can
make
opportunities
for
himself
but
he
can
put
himself
in
such
shape
that
when
or
if
the
opportunities
come
he
is
ready
to
take
advantage
of
them
this
was
what
happened
to
me
in
connection
with
my
experiences
in
morton
hall
i
soon
became
on
good
terms
with
a
number
of
the
ordinary
heelers
and
even
some
of
the
minor
leaders
the
big
leader
was
jake
hess
who
treated
me
with
rather
distant
affability
there
were
prominent
lawyers
and
business
men
who
belonged
but
they
took
little
part
in
the
actual
meetings
what
they
did
was
done
elsewhere
the
running
of
the
machine
was
left
to
jake
hess
and
his
captains
of
tens
and
of
hundreds
among
these
lesser
captains
i
soon
struck
up
a
friendship
with
joe
murray
a
friendship
which
is
as
strong
now
as
it
was
years
ago
he
had
been
born
in
ireland
but
brought
to
new
york
by
his
parents
when
he
was
three
or
four
years
old
and
as
he
expressed
it
raised
as
a
barefooted
boy
on
first
avenue
when
not
eighteen
he
had
enlisted
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
taken
part
in
the
campaign
that
closed
the
civil
war
then
he
came
back
to
first
avenue
and
being
a
fearless
powerful
energetic
young
fellow
careless
and
reckless
speedily
grew
to
some
prominence
as
leader
of
a
gang
in
that
district
and
at
that
time
politics
was
a
rough
business
and
tammany
hall
held
unquestioned
sway
the
district
was
overwhelmingly
democratic
and
joe
and
his
friends
were
democrats
who
on
election
day
performed
the
usual
gang
work
for
the
local
democratic
leader
whose
business
it
was
to
favor
and
reward
them
in
return
this
same
local
leader
like
many
other
greater
leaders
became
puffed
up
by
prosperity
and
forgot
the
instruments
through
which
he
had
achieved
prosperity
after
one
election
he
showed
a
callous
indifference
to
the
hard
work
of
the
gang
and
complete
disregard
of
his
promises
he
counted
upon
the
resentment
wearing
itself
out
as
usual
in
threats
and
bluster
but
joe
murray
was
not
a
man
who
forgot
he
explained
to
his
gang
his
purposes
and
the
necessity
of
being
quiet
accordingly
they
waited
for
their
revenge
until
the
next
election
day
they
then
as
joe
expressed
it
decided
to
vote
furdest
away
from
the
leader
i
am
using
the
language
of
joe
youth
and
the
best
way
to
do
this
was
to
vote
the
republican
ticket
in
those
days
each
party
had
a
booth
near
the
in
each
election
district
where
the
party
representative
dispensed
the
party
ballots
this
had
been
a
district
in
which
as
a
rule
very
early
in
the
day
the
republican
election
leader
had
his
hat
knocked
over
his
eyes
and
his
booth
kicked
over
and
his
ballots
scattered
and
then
the
size
of
the
democratic
majority
depended
on
an
elastic
appreciation
of
exactly
how
much
was
demanded
from
headquarters
but
on
this
day
things
went
differently
the
gang
with
a
roman
sense
of
duty
took
an
active
interest
in
seeing
that
the
republican
was
given
his
full
rights
moreover
they
made
the
most
energetic
reprisals
on
their
opponents
and
as
they
were
distinctly
the
tough
and
fighting
element
justice
came
to
her
own
with
a
whoop
repeaters
were
thrown
out
on
their
heads
every
person
who
could
be
cajoled
or
i
fear
intimidated
was
given
the
republican
ticket
and
the
upshot
was
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
district
which
had
never
hitherto
polled
more
than
two
or
three
per
cent
of
its
vote
republican
broke
about
even
between
the
two
parties
to
joe
it
had
been
merely
an
act
of
retribution
in
so
far
as
it
was
not
simply
a
spree
but
the
leaders
at
the
republican
headquarters
did
not
know
this
and
when
they
got
over
their
paralyzed
astonishment
at
the
returns
they
investigated
to
find
out
what
it
meant
somebody
told
them
that
it
represented
the
work
of
a
young
man
named
joseph
murray
accordingly
they
sent
for
him
the
room
in
which
they
received
him
was
doubtless
some
place
like
morton
hall
and
the
men
who
received
him
were
akin
to
those
who
had
leadership
in
morton
hall
but
in
joe
eyes
they
stood
for
a
higher
civilization
for
opportunity
for
generous
recognition
of
successful
effort
in
short
for
all
the
things
that
an
eager
young
man
desires
he
was
received
and
patted
on
the
back
by
a
man
who
was
a
great
man
to
the
world
in
which
he
lived
he
was
introduced
to
the
audience
as
a
young
man
whose
achievement
was
such
as
to
promise
much
for
the
future
and
moreover
he
was
given
a
place
in
the
as
i
have
said
this
was
long
before
the
day
of
civil
service
reform
now
to
the
wrong
kind
of
man
all
this
might
have
meant
nothing
at
all
but
in
joe
murray
case
it
meant
everything
he
was
by
nature
as
straight
a
man
as
fearless
and
as
stanchly
loyal
as
any
one
whom
i
have
ever
met
a
man
to
be
trusted
in
any
position
demanding
courage
integrity
and
good
faith
he
did
his
duty
in
the
public
service
and
became
devotedly
attached
to
the
organization
which
he
felt
had
given
him
his
chance
in
life
when
i
knew
him
he
was
already
making
his
way
up
one
of
the
proofs
and
evidences
of
which
was
that
he
owned
a
racing
trotter
alice
lane
behind
which
he
gave
me
more
than
one
spin
during
this
first
winter
i
grew
to
like
joe
and
his
particular
cronies
but
i
had
no
idea
that
they
especially
returned
the
liking
and
in
the
first
row
we
had
in
the
organization
which
arose
over
a
movement
that
i
backed
to
stand
by
a
method
of
joe
and
all
his
friends
stood
stiffly
with
the
machine
and
my
side
the
reform
side
was
left
with
only
some
votes
out
of
three
or
four
hundred
i
had
expected
no
other
outcome
and
took
it
but
without
changing
my
attitude
next
fall
as
the
elections
drew
near
joe
thought
he
would
like
to
make
a
drive
at
jake
hess
and
after
considerable
planning
decided
that
his
best
chance
lay
in
the
fight
for
the
nomination
to
the
assembly
the
lower
house
of
the
legislature
he
picked
me
as
the
candidate
with
whom
he
would
be
most
likely
to
win
and
win
he
did
it
was
not
my
fight
it
was
joe
and
it
was
to
him
that
i
owe
my
entry
into
politics
i
had
at
that
time
neither
the
reputation
nor
the
ability
to
have
won
the
nomination
for
myself
and
indeed
never
would
have
thought
of
trying
for
it
jake
hess
was
entirely
about
it
in
spite
of
my
being
my
relations
with
him
had
been
friendly
and
human
and
when
he
was
beaten
he
turned
in
to
help
joe
elect
me
at
first
they
thought
they
would
take
me
on
a
personal
canvass
through
the
saloons
along
sixth
avenue
the
canvass
however
did
not
last
beyond
the
first
saloon
i
was
introduced
with
proper
solemnity
to
the
a
very
important
personage
for
this
was
before
the
days
when
became
merely
the
mortgaged
chattels
of
the
brewers
and
he
began
to
me
a
little
too
much
in
the
tone
of
one
who
was
dealing
with
a
suppliant
for
his
favor
he
said
he
expected
that
i
would
of
course
treat
the
liquor
business
fairly
to
which
i
answered
none
too
cordially
that
i
hoped
i
should
treat
all
interests
fairly
he
then
said
that
he
regarded
the
licenses
as
too
high
to
which
i
responded
that
i
believed
they
were
really
not
high
enough
and
that
i
should
try
to
have
them
made
higher
the
conversation
threatened
to
become
stormy
murray
and
hess
on
some
hastily
improvised
plea
took
me
out
into
the
street
and
then
joe
explained
to
me
that
it
was
not
worth
my
while
staying
in
sixth
avenue
any
longer
that
i
had
better
go
right
back
to
fifth
avenue
and
attend
to
my
friends
there
and
that
he
would
look
after
my
interests
on
sixth
avenue
i
was
triumphantly
elected
once
before
joe
had
interfered
in
similar
fashion
and
secured
the
nomination
of
an
assemblyman
and
shortly
after
election
he
had
grown
to
feel
toward
this
assemblyman
that
he
must
have
fed
on
the
meat
which
rendered
caesar
proud
as
he
became
inaccessible
to
the
ordinary
mortals
whose
place
of
resort
was
morton
hall
he
eyed
me
warily
for
a
short
time
to
see
if
i
was
likely
in
this
respect
to
follow
in
my
predecessor
footsteps
finding
that
i
did
not
he
and
all
my
other
friends
and
supporters
assumed
toward
me
the
very
pleasantest
attitude
that
it
was
possible
to
assume
they
did
not
ask
me
for
a
thing
they
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
the
view
that
i
was
absolutely
straight
and
was
trying
to
do
the
best
i
could
in
the
legislature
they
desired
nothing
except
that
i
should
make
a
success
and
they
supported
me
with
hearty
enthusiasm
i
am
a
little
at
a
loss
to
know
quite
how
to
express
the
quality
in
my
relationship
with
joe
murray
and
my
other
friends
of
this
period
which
rendered
that
relationship
so
beneficial
to
me
when
i
went
into
politics
at
this
time
i
was
not
conscious
of
going
in
with
the
set
purpose
to
benefit
other
people
but
of
getting
for
myself
a
privilege
to
which
i
was
entitled
in
common
with
other
people
so
it
was
in
my
relationship
with
these
men
if
there
had
lurked
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
mind
anywhere
the
thought
that
i
was
in
some
way
a
patron
or
a
benefactor
or
was
doing
something
noble
by
taking
part
in
politics
or
that
i
expected
the
smallest
consideration
save
what
i
could
earn
on
my
own
merits
i
am
certain
that
somehow
or
other
the
existence
of
that
feeling
would
have
been
known
and
resented
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
not
the
slightest
temptation
on
my
part
to
have
any
such
feeling
or
any
one
of
such
feelings
i
no
more
expected
special
consideration
in
politics
than
i
would
have
expected
it
in
the
boxing
ring
i
wished
to
act
squarely
to
others
and
i
wished
to
be
able
to
show
that
i
could
hold
my
own
as
against
others
the
attitude
of
my
new
friends
toward
me
was
first
one
of
polite
reserve
and
then
that
of
friendly
alliance
afterwards
i
became
admitted
to
comradeship
and
then
to
leadership
i
need
hardly
say
how
earnestly
i
believe
that
men
should
have
a
keen
and
lively
sense
of
their
obligations
in
politics
of
their
duty
to
help
forward
great
causes
and
to
struggle
for
the
betterment
of
conditions
that
are
unjust
to
their
fellows
the
men
and
women
who
are
less
fortunate
in
life
but
in
addition
to
this
feeling
there
must
be
a
feeling
of
real
fellowship
with
the
other
men
and
women
engaged
in
the
same
task
fellowship
of
work
with
fun
to
vary
the
work
for
unless
there
is
this
feeling
of
fellowship
of
common
effort
on
an
equal
plane
for
a
common
end
it
will
be
difficult
to
keep
the
relations
wholesome
and
natural
to
be
patronized
is
as
offensive
as
to
be
insulted
no
one
of
us
cares
permanently
to
have
some
one
else
conscientiously
striving
to
do
him
good
what
we
want
is
to
work
with
that
some
one
else
for
the
good
of
both
of
us
any
man
will
speedily
find
that
other
people
can
benefit
him
just
as
much
as
he
can
benefit
them
neither
joe
murray
nor
i
nor
any
of
our
associates
at
that
time
were
alive
to
social
and
industrial
needs
which
we
now
all
of
us
recognize
but
we
then
had
very
clearly
before
our
minds
the
need
of
practically
applying
certain
elemental
virtues
the
virtues
of
honesty
and
efficiency
in
politics
the
virtue
of
efficiency
side
by
side
with
honesty
in
private
and
public
life
alike
the
virtues
of
consideration
and
fair
dealing
in
business
as
between
man
and
man
and
especially
as
between
the
man
who
is
an
employer
and
the
man
who
is
an
employee
on
all
fundamental
questions
joe
murray
and
i
thought
alike
we
never
parted
company
excepting
on
the
question
of
civil
service
reform
where
he
sincerely
felt
that
i
showed
doctrinaire
affinities
that
i
sided
with
the
pharisees
we
got
back
again
into
close
relations
as
soon
as
i
became
police
commissioner
under
mayor
strong
for
joe
was
then
made
excise
commissioner
and
was
i
believe
the
best
excise
commissioner
the
city
of
new
york
ever
had
he
is
now
a
farmer
his
boys
have
been
through
columbia
college
and
he
and
i
look
at
the
questions
political
social
and
industrial
which
confront
us
in
from
practically
the
same
standpoint
just
as
we
once
looked
at
the
questions
that
confronted
us
in
there
are
many
debts
that
i
owe
joe
murray
and
some
for
which
he
was
only
unconsciously
responsible
i
do
not
think
that
a
man
is
fit
to
do
good
work
in
our
american
democracy
unless
he
is
able
to
have
a
genuine
for
understanding
of
and
sympathy
with
his
whatever
their
creed
or
their
birthplace
the
section
in
which
they
live
or
the
work
which
they
do
provided
they
possess
the
only
kind
of
americanism
that
really
counts
the
americanism
of
the
spirit
it
was
no
small
help
to
me
in
the
effort
to
make
myself
a
good
citizen
and
good
american
that
the
political
associate
with
whom
i
was
on
closest
and
most
intimate
terms
during
my
early
years
was
a
man
born
in
ireland
by
creed
a
catholic
with
joe
murray
upbringing
just
as
it
helped
me
greatly
at
a
later
period
to
work
for
certain
vitally
necessary
public
needs
with
arthur
von
briesen
in
whom
the
spirit
of
the
idealists
was
embodied
just
as
my
whole
life
was
influenced
by
my
long
association
with
jacob
riis
whom
i
am
tempted
to
call
the
best
american
i
ever
knew
although
he
was
already
a
young
man
when
he
came
hither
from
denmark
i
was
elected
to
the
legislature
in
the
fall
of
and
found
myself
the
youngest
man
in
that
body
i
was
reelected
the
two
following
years
like
all
young
men
and
inexperienced
members
i
had
considerable
difficulty
in
teaching
myself
to
speak
i
profited
much
by
the
advice
of
a
old
countryman
who
was
unconsciously
paraphrasing
the
duke
of
wellington
who
was
himself
doubtless
paraphrasing
somebody
else
the
advice
ran
do
speak
until
you
are
sure
you
have
something
to
say
and
know
just
what
it
is
then
say
it
and
sit
down
my
first
days
in
the
legislature
were
much
like
those
of
a
boy
in
a
strange
school
my
and
i
eyed
one
another
with
mutual
distrust
each
of
us
chose
his
seat
each
began
by
following
the
lead
of
some
veteran
in
the
first
routine
matters
and
then
in
a
week
or
two
we
began
to
drift
into
groups
according
to
our
several
affinities
the
legislature
was
democratic
i
was
a
republican
from
the
silk
stocking
district
the
wealthiest
district
in
new
york
and
i
was
put
as
one
of
the
minority
members
on
the
committee
of
cities
it
was
a
coveted
position
i
did
not
make
any
effort
to
get
on
and
as
far
as
i
know
was
put
there
merely
because
it
was
felt
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
fitness
of
things
a
very
short
experience
showed
me
that
as
the
legislature
was
then
constituted
the
party
contests
had
no
interest
whatever
for
me
there
was
no
real
party
division
on
most
of
the
things
that
were
of
concern
in
state
politics
both
republicans
and
democrats
being
for
and
against
them
my
friendships
were
made
not
with
regard
to
party
lines
but
because
i
found
and
my
friends
found
that
we
had
the
same
convictions
on
questions
of
principle
and
questions
of
policy
the
only
difference
was
that
there
was
a
larger
proportion
of
these
men
among
the
republicans
than
among
the
democrats
and
that
it
was
easier
for
me
at
the
outset
to
scrape
acquaintance
among
the
men
who
felt
as
i
did
with
the
republicans
they
were
for
the
most
part
from
the
country
districts
my
closest
friend
for
the
three
years
i
was
there
was
billy
from
the
adirondacks
he
kept
a
small
crossroads
store
he
was
a
young
man
although
a
few
years
older
than
i
was
and
like
myself
had
won
his
position
without
regard
to
the
machine
he
had
thought
he
would
like
to
be
assemblyman
so
he
had
taken
his
buggy
and
had
driven
around
franklin
county
visiting
everybody
had
upset
the
local
ring
and
came
to
the
legislature
as
his
own
master
there
is
surely
something
in
american
traditions
that
does
tend
toward
real
democracy
in
spite
of
our
faults
and
shortcomings
in
most
other
countries
two
men
of
as
different
antecedents
ancestry
and
surroundings
as
billy
and
i
would
have
had
far
more
difficulty
in
coming
together
i
came
from
the
biggest
city
in
america
and
from
the
wealthiest
ward
of
that
city
and
he
from
a
backwoods
county
where
he
kept
a
store
at
a
crossroads
in
all
the
unimportant
things
we
seemed
far
apart
but
in
all
the
important
things
we
were
close
together
we
looked
at
all
questions
from
substantially
the
same
and
we
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
every
legislative
fight
during
those
three
years
he
abhorred
demagogy
just
as
he
abhorred
corruption
he
had
thought
much
on
political
problems
he
admired
alexander
hamilton
as
much
as
i
did
being
a
strong
believer
in
a
powerful
national
government
and
we
both
of
us
differed
from
alexander
hamilton
in
being
stout
adherents
of
abraham
lincoln
views
wherever
the
rights
of
the
people
were
concerned
any
man
who
has
met
with
success
if
he
will
be
frank
with
himself
must
admit
that
there
has
been
a
big
element
of
fortune
in
the
success
fortune
favored
me
whereas
her
hand
was
heavy
against
billy
all
his
life
he
had
to
strive
hard
to
wring
his
bread
from
harsh
surroundings
and
a
reluctant
fate
if
fate
had
been
but
a
little
kinder
i
believe
he
would
have
had
a
great
political
career
and
he
would
have
done
good
service
for
the
country
in
any
position
in
which
he
might
have
been
put
there
were
other
republicans
like
isaac
hunt
and
jonas
van
duzer
and
walter
howe
and
henry
sprague
who
were
among
my
close
friends
and
allies
and
a
gigantic
veteran
of
the
civil
war
a
gallant
general
curtis
from
lawrence
county
and
a
capital
fellow
whom
afterwards
when
governor
i
put
on
the
bench
kruse
from
cattaraugus
county
kruse
was
a
german
by
birth
as
far
as
i
know
the
only
german
from
cattaraugus
county
at
that
time
and
besides
being
a
german
he
was
also
a
prohibitionist
among
the
democrats
were
hamden
robb
and
thomas
newbold
and
tom
welch
of
niagara
who
did
a
great
service
in
getting
the
state
to
set
aside
niagara
falls
park
after
a
discouraging
experience
with
the
first
governor
before
whom
we
brought
the
bill
who
listened
with
austere
patience
to
our
arguments
in
favor
of
the
state
establishing
a
park
and
then
conclusively
answered
us
by
the
question
but
gentlemen
why
should
we
spend
the
people
money
when
just
as
much
water
will
run
over
the
falls
without
a
park
as
with
it
then
there
were
a
couple
of
members
from
new
york
and
brooklyn
mike
costello
and
pete
kelly
mike
costello
had
been
elected
as
a
tammany
man
he
was
as
fearless
as
he
was
honest
he
came
from
ireland
and
had
accepted
the
tammany
fourth
of
july
orations
as
indicating
the
real
attitude
of
that
organization
towards
the
rights
of
the
people
a
month
or
two
in
albany
converted
him
to
a
profound
distrust
of
applied
tammany
methods
he
and
i
worked
hand
in
hand
with
equal
indifference
to
our
local
machines
his
machine
leaders
warned
him
fairly
that
they
would
throw
him
out
at
the
next
election
which
they
did
but
he
possessed
a
toughness
of
ability
to
contend
with
adverse
circumstances
and
kept
his
head
well
above
water
a
better
citizen
does
not
exist
and
our
friendship
has
never
faltered
peter
kelly
fate
was
a
tragedy
he
was
a
bright
young
fellow
an
ardent
believer
in
henry
george
at
the
beginning
he
and
i
failed
to
understand
each
other
or
to
get
on
together
for
our
theories
of
government
were
radically
opposed
after
a
couple
of
months
spent
in
active
contests
with
men
whose
theories
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
their
practices
kelly
and
i
found
in
our
turn
that
it
really
did
not
make
much
difference
what
our
abstract
theories
were
on
questions
that
were
not
before
the
legislature
in
view
of
the
fact
that
on
the
actual
matters
before
the
legislature
the
most
important
of
which
involved
questions
of
elementary
morality
we
were
heartily
at
one
we
began
to
vote
together
and
act
together
and
by
the
end
of
the
session
found
that
in
all
practical
matters
that
were
up
for
action
we
thought
together
indeed
each
of
us
was
beginning
to
change
his
theories
so
that
even
in
theory
we
were
coming
closer
together
he
was
ardent
and
generous
he
was
a
young
lawyer
with
a
wife
and
children
whose
ambition
had
tempted
him
into
politics
and
who
had
been
befriended
by
the
local
bosses
under
the
belief
that
they
could
count
upon
him
for
anything
they
really
wished
unfortunately
what
they
really
wished
was
often
corrupt
kelly
defied
them
fought
the
battles
of
the
people
with
ardor
and
good
faith
and
when
the
bosses
refused
him
a
renomination
he
appealed
from
them
to
the
people
when
we
both
came
up
for
reelection
i
won
easily
in
my
district
where
circumstances
conspired
to
favor
me
and
kelly
with
exactly
the
same
record
that
i
had
except
that
it
was
more
creditable
because
he
took
his
stand
against
greater
odds
was
beaten
in
his
district
defeat
to
me
would
have
meant
merely
chagrin
to
kelly
it
meant
terrible
material
disaster
he
had
no
money
like
every
rigidly
honest
man
he
had
found
that
going
into
politics
was
expensive
and
that
his
salary
as
assemblyman
did
not
cover
the
financial
outgo
he
had
lost
his
practice
and
he
had
incurred
the
ill
will
of
the
powerful
so
that
it
was
impossible
at
the
moment
to
pick
up
his
practice
again
and
the
worry
and
disappointment
affected
him
so
much
that
shortly
after
election
he
was
struck
down
by
sickness
just
before
christmas
some
of
us
were
informed
that
kelly
was
in
such
financial
straits
that
he
and
his
family
would
be
put
out
into
the
street
before
new
year
this
was
prevented
by
the
action
of
some
of
his
friends
who
had
served
with
him
in
the
legislature
and
he
recovered
at
least
to
a
degree
and
took
up
the
practice
of
his
profession
but
he
was
a
broken
man
in
the
legislature
in
which
he
served
one
of
his
from
brooklyn
was
the
speaker
alfred
chapin
the
leader
and
the
foremost
representative
of
the
reform
democracy
whom
kelly
zealously
supported
a
few
years
later
chapin
a
very
able
man
was
elected
mayor
of
brooklyn
on
a
reform
democratic
ticket
shortly
after
his
election
i
was
asked
to
speak
at
a
meeting
in
a
brooklyn
club
at
which
various
prominent
citizens
including
the
mayor
were
present
i
spoke
on
civic
decency
and
toward
the
close
of
my
speech
i
sketched
kelly
career
for
my
audience
told
them
how
he
had
stood
up
for
the
rights
of
the
people
of
brooklyn
and
how
the
people
had
failed
to
stand
up
for
him
and
the
way
he
had
been
punished
precisely
because
he
had
been
a
good
citizen
who
acted
as
a
good
citizen
should
act
i
ended
by
saying
that
the
reform
democracy
had
now
come
into
power
that
chapin
was
mayor
and
that
i
very
earnestly
hoped
recognition
would
at
last
be
given
to
kelly
for
the
fight
he
had
waged
at
such
bitter
cost
to
himself
my
words
created
some
impression
and
mayor
chapin
at
once
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
kelly
and
see
that
justice
was
done
him
i
went
home
that
evening
much
pleased
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
i
received
a
brief
note
from
chapin
in
these
words
it
was
nine
last
evening
when
you
finished
speaking
of
what
kelly
had
done
and
when
i
said
that
i
would
take
care
of
him
at
ten
last
night
kelly
died
he
had
been
dying
while
i
was
making
my
speech
and
he
never
knew
that
at
last
there
was
to
be
a
tardy
recognition
of
what
he
had
done
a
tardy
justification
for
the
sacrifices
he
had
made
the
man
had
fought
at
heavy
cost
to
himself
and
with
entire
disinterestedness
for
popular
rights
but
no
recognition
for
what
he
had
done
had
come
to
him
from
the
people
whose
interest
he
had
so
manfully
upheld
where
there
is
no
chance
of
statistical
or
mathematical
measurement
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
just
the
degree
to
which
conditions
change
from
one
period
to
another
this
is
peculiarly
hard
to
do
when
we
deal
with
such
a
matter
as
corruption
personally
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
public
life
we
are
on
the
whole
a
little
better
and
not
a
little
worse
than
we
were
thirty
years
ago
when
i
was
serving
in
the
new
york
legislature
i
think
the
conditions
are
a
little
better
in
national
in
state
and
in
municipal
politics
doubtless
there
are
points
in
which
they
are
worse
and
there
is
an
enormous
amount
that
needs
reformation
but
it
does
seem
to
me
as
if
on
the
whole
things
had
slightly
improved
when
i
went
into
politics
new
york
city
was
under
the
control
of
tammany
which
was
from
time
to
time
opposed
by
some
other
and
evanescent
city
democratic
organization
the
democrats
had
not
yet
fallen
under
tammany
sway
and
were
on
the
point
of
developing
a
big
country
political
boss
in
the
shape
of
david
hill
the
republican
party
was
split
into
the
stalwart
and
factions
accordingly
neither
party
had
one
dominant
boss
or
one
dominant
machine
each
being
controlled
by
jarring
and
warring
bosses
and
machines
the
corruption
was
not
what
it
had
been
in
the
days
of
tweed
when
outside
individuals
controlled
the
legislators
like
puppets
nor
was
there
any
such
centralization
of
the
boss
system
as
occurred
later
many
of
the
members
were
under
the
control
of
local
bosses
or
local
machines
but
the
corrupt
work
was
usually
done
through
the
members
directly
of
course
i
never
had
anything
in
the
nature
of
legal
proof
of
corruption
and
the
figures
i
am
about
to
give
are
merely
approximate
but
three
years
experience
convinced
me
in
the
first
place
that
there
were
a
great
many
thoroughly
corrupt
men
in
the
legislature
perhaps
a
third
of
the
whole
number
and
in
the
next
place
that
the
honest
men
outnumbered
the
corrupt
men
and
that
if
it
were
ever
possible
to
get
an
issue
of
right
and
wrong
put
vividly
and
unmistakably
before
them
in
a
way
that
would
arrest
their
attention
and
that
would
arrest
the
attention
of
their
constituents
we
could
count
on
the
triumph
of
the
right
the
trouble
was
that
in
most
cases
the
issue
was
confused
to
read
some
kinds
of
literature
one
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
corruption
in
legislative
circles
was
in
the
form
of
bribery
by
corporations
and
that
the
line
was
sharp
between
the
honest
man
who
was
always
voting
against
corporations
and
the
dishonest
man
who
was
always
bribed
to
vote
for
them
my
experience
was
the
direct
contrary
of
this
for
every
one
bill
introduced
not
passed
corruptly
to
favor
a
corporation
there
were
at
least
ten
introduced
not
passed
and
in
this
case
not
intended
to
be
passed
to
blackmail
corporations
the
majority
of
the
corrupt
members
would
be
found
voting
for
the
blackmailing
bills
if
they
were
not
paid
and
would
also
be
found
voting
in
the
interests
of
the
corporation
if
they
were
paid
the
blackmailing
or
as
they
were
always
called
the
strike
bills
could
themselves
be
roughly
divided
into
two
categories
bills
which
it
would
have
been
proper
to
pass
and
those
that
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
pass
some
of
the
bills
aimed
at
corporations
were
utterly
wild
and
improper
and
of
these
a
proportion
might
be
introduced
by
honest
and
foolish
zealots
whereas
most
of
them
were
introduced
by
men
who
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
passing
them
but
who
wished
to
be
paid
not
to
pass
them
the
most
profitable
type
of
bill
to
the
accomplished
blackmailer
however
was
a
bill
aimed
at
a
real
corporate
abuse
which
the
corporation
either
from
wickedness
or
folly
was
unwilling
to
remedy
of
the
measures
introduced
in
the
interest
of
corporations
there
were
also
some
that
were
proper
and
some
that
were
improper
the
corrupt
legislators
the
black
horse
cavalry
as
they
were
termed
would
demand
payment
to
vote
as
the
corporations
wished
no
matter
whether
the
bill
was
proper
or
improper
sometimes
if
the
bill
was
a
proper
one
the
corporation
would
have
the
virtue
or
the
strength
of
mind
to
refuse
to
pay
for
its
passage
and
sometimes
it
would
not
a
very
slight
consideration
of
the
above
state
of
affairs
will
show
how
difficult
it
was
at
times
to
keep
the
issue
clear
for
honest
and
dishonest
men
were
continually
found
side
by
side
voting
now
against
and
now
for
a
corporation
measure
the
one
set
from
proper
and
the
other
set
from
grossly
improper
motives
of
course
part
of
the
fault
lay
in
the
attitudes
of
outsiders
it
was
very
early
borne
in
upon
me
that
almost
equal
harm
was
done
by
indiscriminate
defense
of
and
indiscriminate
attack
on
corporations
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
the
man
who
prided
himself
upon
always
antagonizing
the
corporations
or
the
man
who
on
the
plea
that
he
was
a
good
conservative
always
stood
up
for
them
was
the
more
mischievous
agent
of
corruption
and
demoralization
in
one
fight
in
the
house
over
a
bill
as
to
which
there
was
a
bitter
contest
between
two
new
york
city
street
railway
organizations
i
saw
lobbyists
come
down
on
the
floor
itself
and
draw
venal
men
out
into
the
lobbies
with
almost
no
pretense
of
concealing
what
they
were
doing
in
another
case
in
which
the
elevated
railway
corporations
of
new
york
city
against
the
protest
of
the
mayor
and
the
other
local
authorities
rushed
through
a
bill
remitting
over
half
their
taxes
some
of
the
members
who
voted
for
the
measure
probably
thought
it
was
right
but
every
corrupt
man
in
the
house
voted
with
them
and
the
man
must
indeed
have
been
stupid
who
thought
that
these
votes
were
given
disinterestedly
the
effective
fight
against
this
bill
for
the
revision
of
the
elevated
railway
taxes
perhaps
the
most
openly
crooked
measure
which
during
my
time
was
pushed
at
albany
was
waged
by
mike
costello
and
myself
we
used
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
industrious
research
into
the
various
bills
introduced
so
as
to
find
out
what
their
authors
really
had
in
mind
this
research
by
the
way
being
highly
unappreciated
and
much
resented
by
the
authors
in
the
course
of
his
researches
mike
had
been
puzzled
by
an
unimportant
bill
seemingly
related
to
a
constitutional
amendment
introduced
by
a
local
whose
interests
as
far
as
we
knew
were
wholly
remote
from
the
constitution
or
from
any
form
of
abstract
legal
betterment
however
the
measure
seemed
harmless
we
did
not
interfere
and
it
passed
the
house
mike
however
followed
its
career
in
the
senate
and
at
the
last
moment
almost
by
accident
discovered
that
it
had
been
amended
by
the
simple
process
of
striking
out
everything
after
the
enacting
clause
and
unobtrusively
substituting
the
proposal
to
remit
the
elevated
railway
taxes
the
authors
of
the
change
wished
to
avoid
unseemly
publicity
their
hope
was
to
slip
the
measure
through
the
legislature
and
have
it
instantly
signed
by
the
governor
before
any
public
attention
was
excited
in
the
senate
their
plan
worked
to
perfection
there
was
in
the
senate
no
fighting
leadership
of
the
forces
of
decency
and
for
such
leadership
of
the
type
the
representatives
of
corruption
cared
absolutely
nothing
by
bold
and
adroit
management
the
substitution
in
the
senate
was
effected
without
opposition
or
comment
the
bill
in
reality
of
course
an
absolutely
new
and
undebated
bill
then
came
back
to
the
house
nominally
as
a
merely
amended
measure
which
under
the
rules
was
not
open
to
debate
unless
the
amendment
was
first
by
vote
rejected
this
was
the
great
bill
of
the
session
for
the
lobby
and
the
lobby
was
keenly
alive
to
the
need
of
quick
wise
action
no
public
attention
whatever
had
so
far
been
excited
every
measure
was
taken
to
secure
immediate
and
silent
action
a
powerful
leader
whom
the
beneficiaries
of
the
bill
trusted
a
fearless
and
unscrupulous
man
of
much
force
and
great
knowledge
of
parliamentary
law
was
put
in
the
chair
costello
and
i
were
watched
and
when
for
a
moment
we
were
out
of
the
house
the
bill
was
brought
over
from
the
senate
and
the
clerk
began
to
read
it
all
the
black
horse
cavalry
in
expectant
mood
being
in
their
seats
but
mike
costello
who
was
in
the
clerk
room
happened
to
catch
a
few
words
of
what
was
being
read
in
he
rushed
despatched
a
messenger
for
me
and
began
a
filibuster
the
speaker
pro
tem
called
him
to
order
mike
continued
to
speak
and
protest
the
speaker
hammered
him
down
mike
continued
his
protests
the
was
sent
to
arrest
and
remove
him
and
then
i
bounced
in
and
continued
the
protest
and
refused
to
sit
down
or
be
silent
amid
wild
confusion
the
amendment
was
declared
adopted
and
the
bill
was
ordered
engrossed
and
sent
to
the
governor
but
we
had
carried
our
point
the
next
morning
the
whole
press
rang
with
what
had
happened
every
detail
of
the
bill
and
every
detail
of
the
way
it
had
been
slipped
through
the
legislature
were
made
public
all
the
slow
and
cautious
men
in
the
house
who
had
been
afraid
of
taking
sides
now
came
forward
in
support
of
us
another
debate
was
held
on
the
proposal
to
rescind
the
vote
the
city
authorities
waked
up
to
protest
the
governor
refused
to
sign
the
bill
two
or
three
years
later
after
much
litigation
the
taxes
were
paid
in
the
newspapers
it
was
stated
that
the
amount
was
over
it
was
mike
costello
to
whom
primarily
was
due
the
fact
that
this
sum
was
saved
the
public
and
that
the
forces
of
corruption
received
a
stinging
rebuff
he
did
not
expect
recognition
or
reward
for
his
services
and
he
got
none
the
public
if
it
knew
of
what
he
had
done
promptly
forgot
it
the
machine
did
not
forget
it
and
turned
him
down
at
the
next
election
one
of
the
strikes
was
a
bill
for
reducing
the
elevated
railway
fare
which
at
that
time
was
ten
cents
to
five
cents
in
one
legislature
the
men
responsible
for
the
introduction
of
the
bill
suffered
such
an
extraordinary
change
of
heart
that
when
the
bill
came
up
being
pushed
by
zealous
radicals
who
really
were
honest
the
introducers
actually
voted
against
it
a
number
of
us
who
had
been
very
doubtful
about
the
principle
of
the
bill
voted
for
it
simply
because
we
were
convinced
that
money
was
being
used
to
stop
it
and
we
hated
to
seem
to
side
with
the
corruptionists
then
there
came
a
wave
of
popular
feeling
in
its
favor
the
bill
was
reintroduced
at
the
next
session
the
railways
very
wisely
decided
that
they
would
simply
fight
it
on
its
merits
and
the
entire
black
horse
cavalry
contingent
together
with
all
the
former
friends
of
the
measure
voted
against
it
some
of
us
who
in
our
anger
at
the
methods
formerly
resorted
to
for
killing
the
bill
had
voted
for
it
the
previous
year
with
much
again
voted
for
it
as
i
now
think
unwisely
and
the
bill
was
vetoed
by
the
then
governor
grover
cleveland
i
believe
the
veto
was
proper
and
those
who
felt
as
i
did
supported
the
veto
for
although
it
was
entirely
right
that
the
fare
should
be
reduced
to
five
cents
which
was
soon
afterwards
done
the
method
was
unwise
and
would
have
set
a
mischievous
precedent
an
instance
of
an
opposite
kind
occurred
in
connection
with
a
great
railway
corporation
which
wished
to
increase
its
terminal
facilities
in
one
of
our
great
cities
the
representatives
of
the
railway
brought
the
bill
to
me
and
asked
me
to
look
into
it
saying
that
they
were
well
aware
that
it
was
the
kind
of
bill
that
lent
itself
to
blackmail
and
that
they
wished
to
get
it
through
on
its
merits
and
invited
the
most
careful
examination
i
looked
carefully
into
it
found
that
the
municipal
authorities
and
the
whose
property
was
to
be
taken
favored
it
and
also
found
that
it
was
an
absolute
necessity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
city
no
less
than
from
the
standpoint
of
the
railway
so
i
said
i
would
take
charge
of
it
if
i
had
guarantees
that
no
money
should
be
used
and
nothing
improper
done
in
order
to
push
it
this
was
agreed
to
i
was
then
acting
as
chairman
of
the
committee
before
which
the
bill
went
a
very
brief
experience
proved
what
i
had
already
been
practically
sure
of
that
there
was
a
secret
combination
of
the
majority
of
the
committee
on
a
crooked
basis
on
one
pretext
or
another
the
crooked
members
of
the
committee
held
the
bill
up
refusing
to
report
it
either
favorably
or
unfavorably
there
were
one
or
two
members
of
the
committee
who
were
pretty
rough
characters
and
when
i
decided
to
force
matters
i
was
not
sure
that
we
would
not
have
trouble
there
was
a
broken
chair
in
the
room
and
i
got
a
leg
of
it
loose
and
put
it
down
beside
me
where
it
was
not
visible
but
where
i
might
get
at
it
in
a
hurry
if
necessary
i
moved
that
the
bill
be
reported
favorably
this
was
voted
down
without
debate
by
the
combine
some
of
whom
kept
a
wooden
stolidity
of
look
while
others
leered
at
me
with
sneering
insolence
i
then
moved
that
it
be
reported
unfavorably
and
again
the
motion
was
voted
down
by
the
same
majority
and
in
the
same
fashion
i
then
put
the
bill
in
my
pocket
and
announced
that
i
would
report
it
anyhow
this
almost
precipitated
a
riot
especially
when
i
explained
in
answer
to
statements
that
my
conduct
would
be
exposed
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature
that
in
that
case
i
should
give
the
legislature
the
reasons
why
i
suspected
that
the
men
holding
up
all
report
of
the
bill
were
holding
it
up
for
purposes
of
blackmail
the
riot
did
not
come
off
partly
i
think
because
the
opportune
production
of
the
had
a
sedative
effect
and
partly
owing
to
wise
counsels
from
one
or
two
of
my
opponents
accordingly
i
got
the
bill
reported
to
the
legislature
and
put
on
the
calendar
but
here
it
came
to
a
dead
halt
i
think
this
was
chiefly
because
most
of
the
newspapers
which
noticed
the
matter
at
all
treated
it
in
such
a
cynical
spirit
as
to
encourage
the
men
who
wished
to
blackmail
these
papers
reported
the
introduction
of
the
bill
and
said
that
all
the
hungry
legislators
were
clamoring
for
their
share
of
the
pie
and
they
accepted
as
certain
the
fact
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
division
of
pie
this
succeeded
in
frightening
honest
men
and
also
in
relieving
the
rogues
the
former
were
afraid
they
would
be
suspected
of
receiving
money
if
they
voted
for
the
bill
and
the
latter
were
given
a
shield
behind
which
to
stand
until
they
were
paid
i
was
wholly
unable
to
move
the
bill
forward
in
the
legislature
and
finally
a
representative
of
the
railway
told
me
that
he
thought
he
would
like
to
take
the
bill
out
of
my
hands
that
i
did
not
seem
able
to
get
it
through
and
that
perhaps
some
older
and
more
experienced
leader
could
be
more
successful
i
was
pretty
certain
what
this
meant
but
of
course
i
had
no
kind
of
proof
and
moreover
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
say
that
i
could
promise
success
accordingly
the
bill
was
given
into
the
charge
of
a
veteran
whom
i
believe
to
have
been
a
personally
honest
man
but
who
was
not
inquisitive
about
the
motives
influencing
his
colleagues
this
gentleman
who
went
by
a
nickname
which
i
shall
incorrectly
call
the
bald
eagle
of
weehawken
was
efficient
and
knew
his
job
after
a
couple
of
weeks
a
motion
to
put
the
bill
through
was
made
by
the
bald
eagle
the
black
horse
cavalry
whose
feelings
had
undergone
a
complete
change
in
the
intervening
time
voted
unanimously
for
it
in
company
with
all
the
decent
members
and
that
was
the
end
now
here
was
a
bit
of
work
in
the
interest
of
a
corporation
and
in
the
interest
of
a
community
which
the
corporation
at
first
tried
honestly
to
have
put
through
on
its
merits
the
blame
for
the
failure
lay
primarily
in
the
supine
indifference
of
the
community
to
legislative
so
long
as
only
the
corporations
were
blackmailed
except
as
above
mentioned
i
was
not
brought
in
contact
with
big
business
save
in
the
effort
to
impeach
a
certain
judge
this
judge
had
been
used
as
an
instrument
in
their
business
by
certain
of
the
men
connected
with
the
elevated
railways
and
other
great
corporations
at
that
time
we
got
hold
of
his
correspondence
with
one
of
these
men
and
it
showed
a
shocking
willingness
to
use
the
judicial
office
in
any
way
that
one
of
the
kings
of
finance
of
that
day
desired
he
had
actually
held
court
in
one
of
that
financier
rooms
one
expression
in
one
of
the
judge
letters
to
this
financier
i
shall
always
remember
i
am
willing
to
go
to
the
very
verge
of
judicial
discretion
to
serve
your
vast
interests
the
curious
thing
was
that
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
the
judge
himself
was
corrupt
he
may
have
been
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
aside
from
his
being
a
man
of
coarse
moral
fiber
the
trouble
lay
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
he
had
a
genuine
if
i
had
not
so
often
seen
it
i
would
say
a
wholly
inexplicable
reverence
for
the
possessor
of
a
great
fortune
as
such
he
sincerely
believed
that
business
was
the
end
of
existence
and
that
judge
and
legislator
alike
should
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
favor
it
and
the
bigger
the
business
the
more
he
desired
to
favor
it
big
business
of
the
kind
that
is
allied
with
politics
thoroughly
appreciated
the
usefulness
of
such
a
judge
and
every
effort
was
strained
to
protect
him
we
fought
hard
by
we
i
mean
some
thirty
or
forty
legislators
both
republicans
and
democrats
but
the
black
horse
cavalry
and
the
timid
good
men
and
the
dull
conservative
men
were
all
against
us
and
the
vote
in
the
legislature
was
heavily
against
impeachment
the
minority
of
the
committee
that
investigated
him
with
chapin
at
its
head
recommended
impeachment
the
argument
for
impeachment
before
the
committee
was
made
by
francis
lynde
stetson
it
was
my
first
experience
of
the
kind
various
men
whom
i
had
known
well
socially
and
had
been
taught
to
look
up
to
prominent
business
men
and
lawyers
acted
in
a
way
which
not
only
astounded
me
but
which
i
was
quite
unable
to
reconcile
with
the
theories
i
had
formed
as
to
their
high
standing
i
was
little
more
than
a
year
out
of
college
at
the
time
generally
as
has
been
always
the
case
since
they
were
careful
to
avoid
any
direct
conversation
with
me
on
a
concrete
case
of
what
we
now
call
privilege
in
business
and
in
politics
that
is
of
the
alliance
between
business
and
politics
which
represents
improper
favors
rendered
to
some
men
in
return
for
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
others
being
ignored
or
permitted
one
member
of
a
prominent
law
firm
an
old
family
friend
did
however
take
me
out
to
lunch
one
day
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
just
what
it
was
that
i
wished
and
intended
to
do
i
believe
he
had
a
genuine
personal
liking
for
me
he
explained
that
i
had
done
well
in
the
legislature
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
made
the
reform
play
that
i
had
shown
that
i
possessed
ability
such
as
would
make
me
useful
in
the
right
kind
of
law
office
or
business
concern
but
that
i
must
not
overplay
my
hand
that
i
had
gone
far
enough
and
that
now
was
the
time
to
leave
politics
and
identify
myself
with
the
right
kind
of
people
the
people
who
would
always
in
the
long
run
control
others
and
obtain
the
real
rewards
which
were
worth
having
i
asked
him
if
that
meant
that
i
was
to
yield
to
the
ring
in
politics
he
answered
somewhat
impatiently
that
i
was
entirely
mistaken
as
in
fact
i
was
about
there
being
merely
a
political
ring
of
the
kind
of
which
the
papers
were
fond
of
talking
that
the
ring
if
it
could
be
called
such
that
is
the
inner
circle
included
certain
big
business
men
and
the
politicians
lawyers
and
judges
who
were
in
alliance
with
and
to
a
certain
extent
dependent
upon
them
and
that
the
successful
man
had
to
win
his
success
by
the
backing
of
the
same
forces
whether
in
law
business
or
politics
this
conversation
not
only
interested
me
but
made
such
an
impression
that
i
always
remembered
it
for
it
was
the
first
glimpse
i
had
of
that
combination
between
business
and
politics
which
i
was
in
after
years
so
often
to
oppose
in
the
america
of
that
day
and
especially
among
the
people
whom
i
knew
the
successful
business
man
was
regarded
by
everybody
as
preeminently
the
good
citizen
the
orthodox
books
on
political
economy
not
only
in
america
but
in
england
were
written
for
his
especial
glorification
the
tangible
rewards
came
to
him
the
admiration
of
his
of
the
respectable
type
was
apt
to
be
his
and
the
severe
newspaper
moralists
who
were
never
tired
of
denouncing
politicians
and
political
methods
were
wont
to
hold
up
business
methods
as
the
ideal
which
we
were
to
strive
to
introduce
into
political
life
herbert
croly
in
the
promise
of
american
life
has
set
forth
the
reasons
why
our
individualistic
democracy
which
taught
that
each
man
was
to
rely
exclusively
on
himself
was
in
no
way
to
be
interfered
with
by
others
and
was
to
devote
himself
to
his
own
personal
welfare
necessarily
produced
the
type
of
business
man
who
sincerely
believed
as
did
the
rest
of
the
community
that
the
individual
who
amassed
a
big
fortune
was
the
man
who
was
the
best
and
most
typical
american
in
the
legislature
the
problems
with
which
i
dealt
were
mainly
problems
of
honesty
and
decency
and
of
legislative
and
administrative
efficiency
they
represented
the
effort
the
wise
the
vitally
necessary
effort
to
get
efficient
and
honest
government
but
as
yet
i
understood
little
of
the
effort
which
was
already
beginning
for
the
most
part
under
very
bad
leadership
to
secure
a
more
genuine
social
and
industrial
justice
nor
was
i
especially
to
blame
for
this
the
good
citizens
i
then
knew
best
even
when
themselves
men
of
limited
means
men
like
my
colleague
billy
and
my
backwoods
friends
sewall
and
dow
were
no
more
awake
than
i
was
to
the
changing
needs
the
changing
times
were
bringing
their
outlook
was
as
narrow
as
my
own
and
within
its
limits
as
fundamentally
sound
i
wish
to
dwell
on
the
soundness
of
our
outlook
on
life
even
though
as
yet
it
was
not
broad
enough
we
were
no
respecters
of
persons
where
our
vision
was
developed
to
a
degree
that
enabled
us
to
see
crookedness
we
opposed
it
whether
in
great
or
small
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
found
that
it
needed
much
more
courage
to
stand
up
openly
against
labor
men
when
they
were
wrong
than
against
capitalists
when
they
were
wrong
the
sins
against
labor
are
usually
committed
and
the
improper
services
to
capitalists
are
usually
rendered
behind
closed
doors
very
often
the
man
with
the
moral
courage
to
speak
in
the
open
against
labor
when
it
is
wrong
is
the
only
man
anxious
to
do
effective
work
for
labor
when
labor
is
right
the
only
kinds
of
courage
and
honesty
which
are
permanently
useful
to
good
institutions
anywhere
are
those
shown
by
men
who
decide
all
cases
with
impartial
justice
on
grounds
of
conduct
and
not
on
grounds
of
class
we
found
that
in
the
long
run
the
men
who
in
public
blatantly
insisted
that
labor
was
never
wrong
were
the
very
men
who
in
private
could
not
be
trusted
to
stand
for
labor
when
it
was
right
we
grew
heartily
to
distrust
the
reformer
who
never
denounced
wickedness
unless
it
was
embodied
in
a
rich
man
human
nature
does
not
change
and
that
type
of
reformer
is
as
noxious
now
as
he
ever
was
the
upholder
of
popular
rights
who
attacks
wickedness
only
when
it
is
allied
with
wealth
and
who
never
publicly
assails
any
misdeed
no
matter
how
flagrant
if
committed
nominally
in
the
interest
of
labor
has
either
a
warped
mind
or
a
tainted
soul
and
should
be
trusted
by
no
honest
man
it
was
largely
the
indignant
and
contemptuous
dislike
aroused
in
our
minds
by
the
demagogues
of
this
class
which
then
prevented
those
of
us
whose
instincts
at
bottom
were
sound
from
going
as
far
as
we
ought
to
have
gone
along
the
lines
of
governmental
control
of
corporations
and
governmental
interference
on
behalf
of
labor
i
did
however
have
one
exceedingly
useful
experience
a
bill
was
introduced
by
the
union
to
prohibit
the
manufacture
of
cigars
in
i
was
appointed
one
of
a
committee
of
three
to
investigate
conditions
in
the
and
see
if
legislation
should
be
had
of
my
two
colleagues
on
the
committee
one
took
no
interest
in
the
measure
and
privately
said
he
did
not
think
it
was
right
but
that
he
had
to
vote
for
it
because
the
labor
unions
were
strong
in
his
district
and
he
was
pledged
to
support
the
bill
the
other
a
sporting
tammany
man
who
afterwards
abandoned
politics
for
the
was
a
very
good
fellow
he
told
me
frankly
that
he
had
to
be
against
the
bill
because
certain
interests
which
were
and
with
which
he
had
dealings
required
him
to
be
against
it
but
that
i
was
a
free
agent
and
that
if
i
would
look
into
the
matter
he
believed
i
would
favor
the
legislation
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
supposed
i
would
be
against
the
legislation
and
i
rather
think
that
i
was
put
on
the
committee
with
that
idea
for
the
respectable
people
i
knew
were
against
it
it
was
contrary
to
the
principles
of
political
economy
of
the
kind
and
the
business
men
who
spoke
to
me
about
it
shook
their
heads
and
said
that
it
was
designed
to
prevent
a
man
doing
as
he
wished
and
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
with
what
was
his
own
however
my
first
visits
to
the
districts
in
question
made
me
feel
that
whatever
the
theories
might
be
as
a
matter
of
practical
common
sense
i
could
not
conscientiously
vote
for
the
continuance
of
the
conditions
which
i
saw
these
conditions
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
families
of
the
workers
to
live
so
that
the
children
might
grow
up
fitted
for
the
exacting
duties
of
american
citizenship
i
visited
the
once
with
my
colleagues
of
the
committee
once
with
some
of
the
labor
union
representatives
and
once
or
twice
by
myself
in
a
few
of
the
there
were
suites
of
rooms
ample
in
number
where
the
work
on
the
tobacco
was
done
in
rooms
not
occupied
for
cooking
or
sleeping
or
living
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
however
there
were
one
two
or
three
room
apartments
and
the
work
of
manufacturing
the
tobacco
by
men
women
and
children
went
on
day
and
night
in
the
eating
living
and
sleeping
rooms
sometimes
in
one
room
i
have
always
remembered
one
room
in
which
two
families
were
living
on
my
inquiry
as
to
who
the
third
adult
male
was
i
was
told
that
he
was
a
boarder
with
one
of
the
families
there
were
several
children
three
men
and
two
women
in
this
room
the
tobacco
was
stowed
about
everywhere
alongside
the
foul
bedding
and
in
a
corner
where
there
were
scraps
of
food
the
men
women
and
children
in
this
room
worked
by
day
and
far
on
into
the
evening
and
they
slept
and
ate
there
they
were
bohemians
unable
to
speak
english
except
that
one
of
the
children
knew
enough
to
act
as
interpreter
instead
of
opposing
the
bill
i
ardently
championed
it
it
was
a
poorly
drawn
measure
and
the
governor
grover
cleveland
was
at
first
doubtful
about
signing
it
the
union
then
asked
me
to
appear
before
the
governor
and
argue
for
it
i
accordingly
did
so
acting
as
spokesman
for
the
battered
undersized
foreigners
who
represented
the
union
and
the
workers
the
governor
signed
the
bill
afterwards
this
cigar
legislation
was
declared
invalid
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
jacobs
decision
jacobs
was
one
of
the
rare
manufacturers
of
cigars
who
occupied
quite
a
suite
of
rooms
so
that
in
his
case
the
living
conditions
were
altogether
exceptional
what
the
reason
was
which
influenced
those
bringing
the
suit
to
select
the
exceptional
instead
of
the
average
worker
i
do
not
know
of
course
such
action
was
precisely
the
action
which
those
most
interested
in
having
the
law
broken
down
were
anxious
to
see
taken
the
court
of
appeals
declared
the
law
unconstitutional
and
in
their
decision
the
judges
reprobated
the
law
as
an
assault
upon
the
hallowed
influences
of
home
it
was
this
case
which
first
waked
me
to
a
dim
and
partial
understanding
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
were
not
necessarily
the
best
judges
of
what
should
be
done
to
better
social
and
industrial
conditions
the
judges
who
rendered
this
decision
were
men
they
knew
nothing
whatever
of
conditions
they
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
needs
or
of
the
life
and
labor
of
of
their
in
great
cities
they
knew
legalism
but
not
life
their
choice
of
the
words
hallowed
and
home
as
applicable
to
the
revolting
conditions
attending
the
manufacture
of
cigars
in
showed
that
they
had
no
idea
what
it
was
that
they
were
deciding
imagine
the
hallowed
associations
of
a
home
consisting
of
one
room
where
two
families
one
of
them
with
a
boarder
live
eat
and
work
this
decision
completely
blocked
reform
legislation
in
new
york
for
a
score
of
years
and
hampers
it
to
this
day
it
was
one
of
the
most
serious
setbacks
which
the
cause
of
industrial
and
social
progress
and
reform
ever
received
i
had
been
brought
up
to
hold
the
courts
in
especial
reverence
the
people
with
whom
i
was
most
intimate
were
apt
to
praise
the
courts
for
just
such
decisions
as
this
and
to
speak
of
them
as
bulwarks
against
disorder
and
barriers
against
demagogic
legislation
these
were
the
same
people
with
whom
the
judges
who
rendered
these
decisions
were
apt
to
foregather
at
social
clubs
or
dinners
or
in
private
life
very
naturally
they
all
tended
to
look
at
things
from
the
same
standpoint
of
course
it
took
more
than
one
experience
such
as
this
tenement
cigar
case
to
shake
me
out
of
the
attitude
in
which
i
was
brought
up
but
various
decisions
not
only
of
the
new
york
court
but
of
certain
other
state
courts
and
even
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
during
the
quarter
of
a
century
following
the
passage
of
this
legislation
did
at
last
thoroughly
wake
me
to
the
actual
fact
i
grew
to
realize
that
all
that
abraham
lincoln
had
said
about
the
dred
scott
decision
could
be
said
with
equal
truth
and
justice
about
the
numerous
decisions
which
in
our
own
day
were
erected
as
bars
across
the
path
of
social
reform
and
which
brought
to
naught
so
much
of
the
effort
to
secure
justice
and
fair
dealing
for
workingmen
and
workingwomen
and
for
plain
citizens
generally
some
of
the
wickedness
and
inefficiency
in
public
life
was
then
displayed
in
simpler
fashion
than
would
probably
now
be
the
case
once
or
twice
i
was
a
member
of
committees
which
looked
into
gross
and
widely
ramifying
governmental
abuses
on
the
whole
the
most
important
part
i
played
was
in
the
third
legislature
in
which
i
served
when
i
acted
as
chairman
of
a
committee
which
investigated
various
phases
of
new
york
city
official
life
the
most
important
of
the
reform
measures
our
committee
recommended
was
the
bill
taking
away
from
the
aldermen
their
power
of
confirmation
over
the
mayor
appointments
we
found
that
it
was
possible
to
get
citizens
interested
in
the
character
and
capacity
of
the
head
of
the
city
so
that
they
would
exercise
some
intelligent
interest
in
his
conduct
and
qualifications
but
we
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
impossible
to
get
them
interested
in
the
aldermen
and
other
subordinate
officers
in
actual
practice
the
aldermen
were
merely
the
creatures
of
the
local
ward
bosses
or
of
the
big
municipal
bosses
and
where
they
controlled
the
appointments
the
citizens
at
large
had
no
chance
whatever
to
make
their
will
felt
accordingly
we
fought
for
the
principle
which
i
believe
to
be
of
universal
application
that
what
is
needed
in
our
popular
government
is
to
give
plenty
of
power
to
a
few
officials
and
to
make
these
few
officials
genuinely
and
readily
responsible
to
the
people
for
the
exercise
of
that
power
taking
away
the
confirming
power
of
the
board
of
aldermen
did
not
give
the
citizens
of
new
york
good
government
we
knew
that
if
they
chose
to
elect
the
wrong
kind
of
mayor
they
would
have
bad
government
no
matter
what
the
form
of
the
law
was
but
we
did
secure
to
them
the
chance
to
get
good
government
if
they
desired
and
this
was
impossible
as
long
as
the
old
system
remained
the
change
was
fought
in
the
way
in
which
all
similar
changes
always
are
fought
the
corrupt
and
interested
politicians
were
against
it
and
the
they
used
which
rallied
to
them
most
of
the
unthinking
conservatives
were
that
we
were
changing
the
old
constitutional
system
that
we
were
defacing
the
monuments
of
the
wisdom
of
the
founders
of
the
government
that
we
were
destroying
that
distinction
between
legislative
and
executive
power
which
was
the
bulwark
of
our
liberties
and
that
we
were
violent
and
unscrupulous
radicals
with
no
reverence
for
the
past
of
course
the
investigations
disclosures
and
proceedings
of
the
investigating
committee
of
which
i
was
chairman
brought
me
into
bitter
personal
conflict
with
very
powerful
financiers
very
powerful
politicians
and
with
certain
newspapers
which
these
financiers
and
politicians
controlled
a
number
of
able
and
unscrupulous
men
were
fighting
some
for
their
financial
lives
and
others
to
keep
out
of
unpleasantly
close
neighborhood
to
state
prison
this
meant
that
there
were
blows
to
be
taken
as
well
as
given
in
such
political
struggles
those
who
went
in
for
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
did
speedily
excited
animosities
among
strong
and
cunning
men
who
would
stop
at
little
to
gratify
their
animosity
any
man
engaged
in
this
particular
type
of
militant
and
practical
reform
movement
was
soon
made
to
feel
that
he
had
better
not
undertake
to
push
matters
home
unless
his
own
character
was
unassailable
on
one
of
the
investigating
committees
on
which
i
served
there
was
a
countryman
a
very
able
man
who
when
he
reached
new
york
city
felt
as
certain
americans
do
when
they
go
to
paris
that
the
moral
restraints
of
his
native
place
no
longer
applied
with
all
his
ability
he
was
not
shrewd
enough
to
realize
that
the
police
department
was
having
him
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
carefully
shadowed
he
was
caught
by
a
man
doing
what
he
had
no
business
to
do
and
from
that
time
on
he
dared
not
act
save
as
those
who
held
his
secret
permitted
him
to
act
thenceforth
those
officials
who
stood
behind
the
police
department
had
one
man
on
the
committee
on
whom
they
could
count
i
never
saw
terror
more
ghastly
on
a
strong
man
face
than
on
the
face
of
this
man
on
one
or
two
occasions
when
he
feared
that
events
in
the
committee
might
take
such
a
course
as
to
force
him
into
a
position
where
his
colleagues
would
expose
him
even
if
the
city
officials
did
not
however
he
escaped
for
we
were
never
able
to
get
the
kind
of
proof
which
would
warrant
our
asking
for
the
action
in
which
this
man
could
not
have
joined
traps
were
set
for
more
than
one
of
us
and
if
we
had
walked
into
these
traps
our
public
careers
would
have
ended
at
least
so
far
as
following
them
under
the
conditions
which
alone
make
it
worth
while
to
be
in
public
life
at
all
a
man
can
of
course
hold
public
office
and
many
a
man
does
hold
public
office
and
lead
a
public
career
of
a
sort
even
if
there
are
other
men
who
possess
secrets
about
him
which
he
can
not
afford
to
have
divulged
but
no
man
can
lead
a
public
career
really
worth
leading
no
man
can
act
with
rugged
independence
in
serious
crises
nor
strike
at
great
abuses
nor
afford
to
make
powerful
and
unscrupulous
foes
if
he
is
himself
vulnerable
in
his
private
character
nor
will
clean
conduct
by
itself
enable
a
man
to
render
good
service
i
have
always
been
fond
of
josh
billings
remark
that
it
is
much
easier
to
be
a
harmless
dove
than
a
wise
serpent
there
are
plenty
of
decent
legislators
and
plenty
of
able
legislators
but
the
blamelessness
and
the
fighting
edge
are
not
always
combined
both
qualities
are
necessary
for
the
man
who
is
to
wage
active
battle
against
the
powers
that
prey
he
must
be
clean
of
life
so
that
he
can
laugh
when
his
public
or
his
private
record
is
searched
and
yet
being
clean
of
life
will
not
avail
him
if
he
is
either
foolish
or
timid
he
must
walk
warily
and
fearlessly
and
while
he
should
never
brawl
if
he
can
avoid
it
he
must
be
ready
to
hit
hard
if
the
need
arises
let
him
remember
by
the
way
that
the
unforgivable
crime
is
soft
hitting
do
not
hit
at
all
if
it
can
be
avoided
but
never
hit
softly
like
most
young
men
in
politics
i
went
through
various
oscillations
of
feeling
before
i
found
myself
at
one
period
i
became
so
impressed
with
the
virtue
of
complete
independence
that
i
proceeded
to
act
on
each
case
purely
as
i
personally
viewed
it
without
paying
any
heed
to
the
principles
and
prejudices
of
others
the
result
was
that
i
speedily
and
deservedly
lost
all
power
of
accomplishing
anything
at
all
and
i
thereby
learned
the
invaluable
lesson
that
in
the
practical
activities
of
life
no
man
can
render
the
highest
service
unless
he
can
act
in
combination
with
his
fellows
which
means
a
certain
amount
of
between
him
and
them
again
i
at
one
period
began
to
believe
that
i
had
a
future
before
me
and
that
it
behooved
me
to
be
very
and
scan
each
action
carefully
with
a
view
to
its
possible
effect
on
that
future
this
speedily
made
me
useless
to
the
public
and
an
object
of
aversion
to
myself
and
i
then
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
try
not
to
think
of
the
future
at
all
but
would
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
each
office
i
held
would
be
the
last
i
ever
should
hold
and
that
i
would
confine
myself
to
trying
to
do
my
work
as
well
as
possible
while
i
held
that
office
i
found
that
for
me
personally
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
either
enjoy
myself
or
render
good
service
to
the
country
and
i
never
afterwards
deviated
from
this
plan
as
regards
political
advancement
the
bosses
could
of
course
do
a
good
deal
at
that
time
the
warring
stalwart
and
factions
of
the
republican
party
were
supporting
respectively
president
arthur
and
senator
miller
neither
side
cared
for
me
the
first
year
in
the
legislature
i
rose
to
a
position
of
leadership
so
that
in
the
second
year
when
the
republicans
were
in
a
minority
i
received
the
minority
nomination
for
speaker
although
i
was
still
the
youngest
man
in
the
house
being
years
old
the
third
year
the
republicans
carried
the
legislature
and
the
bosses
at
once
took
a
hand
in
the
speakership
contest
i
made
a
stout
fight
for
the
nomination
but
the
bosses
of
the
two
factions
the
stalwarts
and
the
combined
and
i
was
beaten
i
was
much
chagrined
for
the
moment
but
the
fact
that
i
had
fought
hard
and
efficiently
even
though
defeated
and
that
i
had
made
the
fight
with
no
machine
back
of
me
assured
my
standing
as
floor
leader
my
defeat
in
the
end
materially
strengthened
my
position
and
enabled
me
to
accomplish
far
more
than
i
could
have
accomplished
as
speaker
as
so
often
i
found
that
the
titular
position
was
of
no
consequence
what
counted
was
the
combination
of
the
opportunity
with
the
ability
to
accomplish
results
the
achievement
was
the
thing
the
position
whether
titularly
high
or
low
was
of
consequence
only
in
so
far
as
it
widened
the
chance
for
achievement
after
the
session
closed
four
of
us
who
looked
at
politics
from
the
same
standpoint
and
were
known
as
independent
or
republicans
were
sent
by
the
state
convention
as
to
the
republican
national
convention
of
where
i
advocated
as
vigorously
as
i
knew
how
the
nomination
of
senator
george
edmunds
edmunds
was
defeated
and
blaine
nominated
blaine
was
clearly
the
choice
of
the
rank
and
file
of
the
party
his
nomination
was
won
in
fair
and
aboveboard
fashion
because
the
rank
and
file
of
the
party
stood
back
of
him
and
i
supported
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
in
the
ensuing
campaign
the
speakership
contest
enlightened
me
as
regards
more
things
than
the
attitude
of
the
bosses
i
had
already
had
some
exasperating
experiences
with
the
silk
stocking
reformer
type
as
abraham
lincoln
called
it
the
gentlemen
who
were
very
nice
very
refined
who
shook
their
heads
over
political
corruption
and
discussed
it
in
and
parlors
but
who
were
wholly
unable
to
grapple
with
real
men
in
real
life
they
were
apt
vociferously
to
demand
reform
as
if
it
were
some
concrete
substance
like
cake
which
could
be
handed
out
at
will
in
tangible
masses
if
only
the
demand
were
urgent
enough
these
parlor
reformers
made
up
for
inefficiency
in
action
by
zeal
in
criticising
and
they
delighted
in
criticising
the
men
who
really
were
doing
the
things
which
they
said
ought
to
be
done
but
which
they
lacked
the
sinewy
power
to
do
they
often
upheld
ideals
which
were
not
merely
impossible
but
highly
undesirable
and
thereby
played
into
the
hands
of
the
very
politicians
to
whom
they
professed
to
be
most
hostile
moreover
if
they
believed
that
their
own
interests
individually
or
as
a
class
were
jeoparded
they
were
apt
to
show
no
higher
standards
than
did
the
men
they
usually
denounced
one
of
their
shibboleths
was
that
the
office
should
seek
the
man
and
not
the
man
the
office
this
is
entirely
true
of
certain
offices
at
certain
times
it
is
entirely
untrue
when
the
circumstances
are
different
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
and
undesirable
for
washington
to
have
sought
the
presidency
but
if
abraham
lincoln
had
not
sought
the
presidency
he
never
would
have
been
nominated
the
objection
in
such
a
case
as
this
lies
not
to
seeking
the
office
but
to
seeking
it
in
any
but
an
honorable
and
proper
manner
the
effect
of
the
shibboleth
in
question
is
usually
merely
to
put
a
premium
on
hypocrisy
and
therefore
to
favor
the
creature
who
is
willing
to
rise
by
hypocrisy
when
i
ran
for
speaker
the
whole
body
of
machine
politicians
was
against
me
and
my
only
chance
lay
in
arousing
the
people
in
the
different
districts
to
do
this
i
had
to
visit
the
districts
put
the
case
fairly
before
the
men
whom
i
saw
and
make
them
understand
that
i
was
really
making
a
fight
and
would
stay
in
the
fight
to
the
end
yet
there
were
reformers
who
shook
their
heads
and
deplored
my
activity
in
the
canvass
of
course
the
one
thing
which
corrupt
machine
politicians
most
desire
is
to
have
decent
men
frown
on
the
activity
that
is
on
the
efficiency
of
the
honest
man
who
genuinely
wishes
to
reform
politics
if
efficiency
is
left
solely
to
bad
men
and
if
virtue
is
confined
solely
to
inefficient
men
the
result
can
not
be
happy
when
i
entered
politics
there
were
as
there
always
had
been
and
as
there
always
will
be
any
number
of
bad
men
in
politics
who
were
thoroughly
efficient
and
any
number
of
good
men
who
would
like
to
have
done
lofty
things
in
politics
but
who
were
thoroughly
inefficient
if
i
wished
to
accomplish
anything
for
the
country
my
business
was
to
combine
decency
and
efficiency
to
be
a
thoroughly
practical
man
of
high
ideals
who
did
his
best
to
reduce
those
ideals
to
actual
practice
this
was
my
ideal
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
strove
to
live
up
to
it
to
a
young
man
life
in
the
new
york
legislature
was
always
interesting
and
often
entertaining
there
was
always
a
struggle
of
some
kind
on
hand
sometimes
it
was
on
a
naked
question
of
right
and
wrong
sometimes
it
was
on
a
question
of
real
constructive
statesmanship
moreover
there
were
all
kinds
of
humorous
incidents
the
humor
being
usually
of
the
unconscious
kind
in
one
session
of
the
legislature
the
new
york
city
democratic
representatives
were
split
into
two
camps
and
there
were
two
rivals
for
leadership
one
of
these
was
a
thoroughly
person
who
was
afterwards
for
several
years
in
congress
he
had
been
a
local
magistrate
and
was
called
judge
generally
he
and
i
were
friendly
but
occasionally
i
did
something
that
irritated
him
he
was
always
willing
to
vote
for
any
other
member
bill
himself
and
he
regarded
it
as
for
any
one
to
oppose
one
of
his
bills
especially
if
the
opposition
was
upon
the
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
his
views
of
the
constitution
were
so
excessively
liberal
as
to
make
even
me
feel
as
if
i
belonged
to
the
straitest
sect
of
strict
constructionists
on
one
occasion
he
had
a
bill
to
appropriate
money
with
obvious
impropriety
for
the
relief
of
some
miscreant
whom
he
styled
one
of
the
honest
yeomanry
of
the
state
when
i
explained
to
him
that
it
was
clearly
unconstitutional
he
answered
me
friend
the
constitution
do
touch
little
things
like
that
and
then
added
with
an
ingratiating
smile
anyhow
i
never
allow
the
constitution
to
come
between
friends
at
the
time
i
was
looking
over
the
proofs
of
bryce
american
commonwealth
and
i
told
him
the
incident
he
put
it
into
the
first
edition
of
the
commonwealth
whether
it
is
in
the
last
edition
or
not
i
can
not
say
on
another
occasion
the
same
gentleman
came
to
an
issue
with
me
in
a
debate
and
wound
up
his
speech
by
explaining
that
i
occupied
what
lawyers
would
call
a
quasi
position
on
the
bill
his
rival
was
a
man
of
totally
different
type
a
man
of
great
natural
dignity
also
born
in
ireland
he
had
served
with
gallantry
in
the
civil
war
after
the
close
of
the
war
he
organized
an
expedition
to
conquer
canada
the
expedition
however
got
so
drunk
before
reaching
albany
that
it
was
there
incarcerated
in
jail
whereupon
its
leader
abandoned
it
and
went
into
new
york
politics
instead
he
was
a
man
of
influence
and
later
occupied
in
the
police
department
the
same
position
as
commissioner
which
i
myself
at
one
time
occupied
he
felt
that
his
rival
had
gained
too
much
glory
at
my
expense
and
walking
over
with
ceremonious
solemnity
to
where
the
said
rival
was
sitting
close
beside
me
he
said
to
him
i
would
like
you
to
know
cameron
cameron
of
course
was
not
the
real
name
that
roosevelt
knows
more
law
in
a
wake
than
you
do
in
a
month
and
more
than
that
michael
cameron
what
do
you
mane
by
quoting
latin
on
the
floor
of
this
house
when
you
do
know
the
alpha
and
omayga
of
the
language
there
was
in
the
legislature
during
the
deadlock
above
mentioned
a
man
whom
i
will
call
brogan
he
looked
like
a
serious
elderly
frog
i
never
heard
him
speak
more
than
once
it
was
before
the
legislature
was
organized
or
had
adopted
any
rules
and
each
day
the
only
business
was
for
the
clerk
to
call
the
roll
one
day
brogan
suddenly
rose
and
the
following
dialogue
occurred
brogan
misther
the
clerk
the
gentleman
from
new
york
brogan
i
rise
to
a
point
of
ordher
under
the
rules
the
clerk
there
are
no
rules
brogan
thin
i
object
to
them
the
clerk
there
are
no
rules
to
object
to
brogan
oh
nonplussed
but
immediately
recovering
himself
thin
i
move
that
they
be
amended
until
there
the
deadlock
was
tedious
and
we
hailed
with
joy
such
enlivening
incidents
as
the
above
during
my
three
years
service
in
the
legislature
i
worked
on
a
very
simple
philosophy
of
government
it
was
that
personal
character
and
initiative
are
the
prime
requisites
in
political
and
social
life
it
was
not
only
a
good
but
an
absolutely
indispensable
theory
as
far
as
it
went
but
it
was
defective
in
that
it
did
not
sufficiently
allow
for
the
need
of
collective
action
i
shall
never
forget
the
men
with
whom
i
worked
hand
in
hand
in
these
legislative
struggles
not
only
my
but
some
of
the
newspaper
reporters
such
as
spinney
and
cunningham
and
then
in
addition
the
men
in
the
various
districts
who
helped
us
we
had
made
up
our
minds
that
we
must
not
fight
fire
with
fire
that
on
the
contrary
the
way
to
win
out
was
to
equal
our
foes
in
practical
efficiency
and
yet
to
stand
at
the
opposite
plane
from
them
in
applied
morality
it
was
not
always
easy
to
keep
the
just
middle
especially
when
it
happened
that
on
one
side
there
were
corrupt
and
unscrupulous
demagogues
and
on
the
other
side
corrupt
and
unscrupulous
reactionaries
our
effort
was
to
hold
the
scales
even
between
both
we
tried
to
stand
with
the
cause
of
righteousness
even
though
its
advocates
were
anything
but
righteous
we
endeavored
to
cut
out
the
abuses
of
property
even
though
good
men
of
property
were
misled
into
upholding
those
abuses
we
refused
to
be
frightened
into
sanctioning
improper
assaults
upon
property
although
we
knew
that
the
champions
of
property
themselves
did
things
that
were
wicked
and
corrupt
we
were
as
yet
by
no
means
as
thoroughly
awake
as
we
ought
to
have
been
to
the
need
of
controlling
big
business
and
to
the
damage
done
by
the
combination
of
politics
with
big
business
in
this
matter
i
was
not
behind
the
rest
of
my
friends
indeed
i
was
ahead
of
them
for
no
serious
leader
in
political
life
then
appreciated
the
prime
need
of
grappling
with
these
questions
one
partial
reason
not
an
excuse
or
a
justification
but
a
partial
reason
for
my
slowness
in
grasping
the
importance
of
action
in
these
matters
was
the
corrupt
and
unattractive
nature
of
so
many
of
the
men
who
championed
popular
reforms
their
insincerity
and
the
folly
of
so
many
of
the
actions
which
they
advocated
even
at
that
date
i
had
neither
sympathy
with
nor
admiration
for
the
man
who
was
merely
a
money
king
and
i
did
not
regard
the
money
touch
when
divorced
from
other
qualities
as
entitling
a
man
to
either
respect
or
consideration
as
recited
above
we
did
on
more
than
one
occasion
fight
battles
in
which
we
neither
took
nor
gave
quarter
against
the
most
prominent
and
powerful
financiers
and
financial
interests
of
the
day
but
most
of
the
fights
in
which
we
were
engaged
were
for
pure
honesty
and
decency
and
they
were
more
apt
to
be
against
that
form
of
corruption
which
found
its
expression
in
demagogy
than
against
that
form
of
corruption
which
defended
or
advocated
privilege
fundamentally
our
fight
was
part
of
the
eternal
war
against
the
powers
that
prey
and
we
cared
not
a
whit
in
what
rank
of
life
these
powers
were
found
to
play
the
demagogue
for
purposes
of
is
a
cardinal
sin
against
the
people
in
a
democracy
exactly
as
to
play
the
courtier
for
such

chapter
iv
in
cowboy
land
though
i
had
previously
made
a
trip
into
the
then
territory
of
dakota
beyond
the
red
river
it
was
not
until
that
i
went
to
the
little
missouri
and
there
took
hold
of
two
cattle
ranches
the
chimney
butte
and
the
elkhorn
it
was
still
the
wild
west
in
those
days
the
far
west
the
west
of
owen
wister
stories
and
frederic
remington
drawings
the
west
of
the
indian
and
the
the
soldier
and
the
that
land
of
the
west
has
gone
now
gone
gone
with
lost
atlantis
gone
to
the
isle
of
ghosts
and
of
strange
dead
memories
it
was
a
land
of
vast
silent
spaces
of
lonely
rivers
and
of
plains
where
the
wild
game
stared
at
the
passing
horseman
it
was
a
land
of
scattered
ranches
of
herds
of
cattle
and
of
reckless
riders
who
unmoved
looked
in
the
eyes
of
life
or
of
death
in
that
land
we
led
a
free
and
hardy
life
with
horse
and
with
rifle
we
worked
under
the
scorching
midsummer
sun
when
the
wide
plains
shimmered
and
wavered
in
the
heat
and
we
knew
the
freezing
misery
of
riding
night
guard
round
the
cattle
in
the
late
fall
in
the
soft
springtime
the
stars
were
glorious
in
our
eyes
each
night
before
we
fell
asleep
and
in
the
winter
we
rode
through
blinding
blizzards
when
the
driven
burned
our
faces
there
were
monotonous
days
as
we
guided
the
trail
cattle
or
the
beef
herds
hour
after
hour
at
the
slowest
of
walks
and
minutes
or
hours
teeming
with
excitement
as
we
stopped
stampedes
or
swam
the
herds
across
rivers
treacherous
with
quicksands
or
brimmed
with
running
ice
we
knew
toil
and
hardship
and
hunger
and
thirst
and
we
saw
men
die
violent
deaths
as
they
worked
among
the
horses
and
cattle
or
fought
in
evil
feuds
with
one
another
but
we
felt
the
beat
of
hardy
life
in
our
veins
and
ours
was
the
glory
of
work
and
the
joy
of
living
it
was
right
and
necessary
that
this
life
should
pass
for
the
safety
of
our
country
lies
in
its
being
made
the
country
of
the
small
the
great
unfenced
ranches
in
the
days
of
free
grass
necessarily
represented
a
temporary
stage
in
our
history
the
large
migratory
flocks
of
sheep
each
guarded
by
the
hired
shepherds
of
absentee
owners
were
the
first
enemies
of
the
cattlemen
and
owing
to
the
way
they
ate
out
the
grass
and
destroyed
all
other
vegetation
these
roving
sheep
bands
represented
little
of
permanent
good
to
the
country
but
the
homesteaders
the
permanent
settlers
the
men
who
took
up
each
his
own
farm
on
which
he
lived
and
brought
up
his
family
these
represented
from
the
national
standpoint
the
most
desirable
of
all
possible
users
of
and
dwellers
on
the
soil
their
advent
meant
the
breaking
up
of
the
big
ranches
and
the
change
was
a
national
gain
although
to
some
of
us
an
individual
loss
i
first
reached
the
little
missouri
on
a
northern
pacific
train
about
three
in
the
morning
of
a
cool
september
day
in
aside
from
the
station
the
only
building
was
a
ramshackle
structure
called
the
pyramid
park
hotel
i
dragged
my
thither
and
hammered
at
the
door
until
the
frowsy
proprietor
appeared
muttering
oaths
he
ushered
me
upstairs
where
i
was
given
one
of
the
fourteen
beds
in
the
room
which
by
itself
constituted
the
entire
upper
floor
next
day
i
walked
over
to
the
abandoned
army
post
and
after
some
hours
among
the
gray
log
shacks
a
ranchman
who
had
driven
into
the
station
agreed
to
take
me
out
to
his
ranch
the
chimney
butte
ranch
where
he
was
living
with
his
brother
and
their
partner
the
ranch
was
a
log
structure
with
a
dirt
roof
a
corral
for
the
horses
near
by
and
a
jabbed
against
the
rear
of
the
ranch
house
inside
there
was
only
one
room
with
a
table
three
or
four
chairs
a
and
three
bunks
the
owners
were
sylvane
and
joe
ferris
and
william
merrifield
later
all
three
of
them
held
my
commissions
while
i
was
president
merrifield
was
marshal
of
montana
and
as
presidential
elector
cast
the
vote
of
that
state
for
me
in
sylvane
ferris
was
land
officer
in
north
dakota
and
joe
ferris
postmaster
at
medora
there
was
a
fourth
man
george
meyer
who
also
worked
for
me
later
that
evening
we
all
played
old
sledge
round
the
table
and
at
one
period
the
game
was
interrupted
by
a
frightful
squawking
outside
which
told
us
that
a
bobcat
had
made
a
raid
on
the
after
a
buffalo
hunt
with
my
original
friend
joe
ferris
i
entered
into
partnership
with
merrifield
and
sylvane
ferris
and
we
started
a
cow
ranch
with
the
maltese
cross
brand
always
known
as
maltee
cross
by
the
way
as
the
general
impression
along
the
little
missouri
was
that
maltese
must
be
a
plural
years
later
my
four
friends
of
that
night
were
delegates
to
the
first
progressive
national
convention
at
chicago
they
were
among
my
most
constant
companions
for
the
few
years
next
succeeding
the
evening
when
the
bobcat
interrupted
the
game
of
old
sledge
i
lived
and
worked
with
them
on
the
ranch
and
with
them
and
many
others
like
them
on
the
and
i
brought
out
from
maine
in
order
to
start
the
elkhorn
ranch
lower
down
the
river
my
two
backwoods
friends
sewall
and
dow
my
brands
for
the
lower
ranch
were
the
elkhorn
and
triangle
i
do
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
life
more
attractive
to
a
vigorous
young
fellow
than
life
on
a
cattle
ranch
in
those
days
it
was
a
fine
healthy
life
too
it
taught
a
man
hardihood
and
the
value
of
instant
decision
in
short
the
virtues
that
ought
to
come
from
life
in
the
open
country
i
enjoyed
the
life
to
the
full
after
the
first
year
i
built
on
the
elkhorn
ranch
a
long
low
ranch
house
of
hewn
logs
with
a
veranda
and
with
in
addition
to
the
other
rooms
a
bedroom
for
myself
and
a
with
a
big
i
got
out
a
i
am
very
fond
of
and
enough
books
to
fill
two
or
three
shelves
and
a
rubber
bathtub
so
that
i
could
get
a
bath
and
then
i
do
not
see
how
any
one
could
have
lived
more
comfortably
we
had
buffalo
robes
and
bearskins
of
our
own
killing
we
always
kept
the
house
clean
using
the
word
in
a
rather
large
sense
there
were
at
least
two
rooms
that
were
always
warm
even
in
the
bitterest
weather
and
we
had
plenty
to
eat
commonly
the
mainstay
of
every
meal
was
game
of
our
own
killing
usually
antelope
or
deer
sometimes
grouse
or
ducks
and
occasionally
in
the
earlier
days
buffalo
or
elk
we
also
had
flour
and
bacon
sugar
salt
and
canned
tomatoes
and
later
when
some
of
the
men
married
and
brought
out
their
wives
we
had
all
kinds
of
good
things
such
as
jams
and
jellies
made
from
the
wild
plums
and
the
buffalo
berries
and
potatoes
from
the
forlorn
little
garden
patch
moreover
we
had
milk
most
ranchmen
at
that
time
never
had
milk
i
knew
more
than
one
ranch
with
ten
thousand
head
of
cattle
where
there
was
not
a
cow
that
could
be
milked
we
made
up
our
minds
that
we
would
be
more
enterprising
accordingly
we
started
to
domesticate
some
of
the
cows
our
first
effort
was
not
successful
chiefly
because
we
did
not
devote
the
needed
time
and
patience
to
the
matter
and
we
found
that
to
race
a
cow
two
miles
at
full
speed
on
horseback
then
rope
her
throw
her
and
turn
her
upside
down
to
milk
her
while
exhilarating
as
a
pastime
was
not
productive
of
results
gradually
we
accumulated
tame
cows
and
after
we
had
thinned
out
the
bobcats
and
coyotes
more
chickens
the
ranch
house
stood
on
the
brink
of
a
low
bluff
overlooking
the
broad
shallow
bed
of
the
little
missouri
through
which
at
most
seasons
there
ran
only
a
trickle
of
water
while
in
times
of
freshet
it
was
filled
brimful
with
the
boiling
foaming
muddy
torrent
there
was
no
neighbor
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
on
either
side
of
me
the
river
twisted
down
in
long
curves
between
narrow
bottoms
bordered
by
sheer
cliff
walls
for
the
bad
lands
a
chaos
of
peaks
plateaus
and
ridges
rose
abruptly
from
the
edges
of
the
level
or
grassy
alluvial
meadows
in
front
of
the
veranda
was
a
row
of
cottonwood
trees
with
leaves
which
quivered
all
day
long
if
there
was
a
breath
of
air
from
these
trees
came
the
melancholy
cooing
of
mourning
doves
and
little
owls
perched
in
them
and
called
tremulously
at
night
in
the
long
summer
afternoons
we
would
sometimes
sit
on
the
piazza
when
there
was
no
work
to
be
done
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
watching
the
cattle
on
the
and
the
sharply
channeled
and
strangely
carved
amphitheater
of
cliffs
across
the
bottom
opposite
while
the
vultures
wheeled
overhead
their
black
shadows
gliding
across
the
glaring
white
of
the
dry
sometimes
from
the
ranch
we
saw
deer
and
once
when
we
needed
meat
i
shot
one
across
the
river
as
i
stood
on
the
piazza
in
the
winter
in
the
days
of
iron
cold
when
everything
was
white
under
the
snow
the
river
lay
in
its
bed
fixed
and
immovable
as
a
bar
of
bent
steel
and
then
at
night
wolves
and
lynxes
traveled
up
and
down
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
highway
passing
in
front
of
the
ranch
house
often
in
the
late
fall
or
early
winter
after
a
hard
day
hunting
or
when
returning
from
one
of
the
winter
line
camps
we
did
not
reach
the
ranch
until
hours
after
sunset
and
after
the
weary
tramping
in
the
cold
it
was
keen
pleasure
to
catch
the
first
red
gleam
of
the
windows
across
the
snowy
wastes
the
elkhorn
ranch
house
was
built
mainly
by
sewall
and
dow
who
like
most
men
from
the
maine
woods
were
mighty
with
the
ax
i
could
chop
fairly
well
for
an
amateur
but
i
could
not
do
the
work
they
could
one
day
when
we
were
cutting
down
the
cottonwood
trees
to
begin
our
building
operations
i
heard
some
one
ask
dow
what
the
total
cut
had
been
and
dow
not
realizing
that
i
was
within
hearing
answered
well
bill
cut
down
i
cut
and
the
boss
he
beavered
down
seventeen
those
who
have
seen
the
stump
of
a
tree
which
has
been
gnawed
down
by
a
beaver
will
understand
the
exact
force
of
the
comparison
in
those
days
on
a
cow
ranch
the
men
were
apt
to
be
away
on
the
various
at
least
half
the
time
it
was
interesting
and
exciting
work
and
except
for
the
lack
of
sleep
on
the
spring
and
summer
it
was
not
exhausting
work
compared
to
lumbering
or
mining
or
blacksmithing
to
sit
in
the
saddle
is
an
easy
form
of
labor
the
ponies
were
of
course
and
unshod
each
man
had
his
own
string
of
nine
or
ten
one
pony
would
be
used
for
the
morning
work
one
for
the
afternoon
and
neither
would
again
be
used
for
the
next
three
days
a
separate
pony
was
kept
for
night
riding
the
spring
and
early
summer
were
especially
for
the
branding
of
calves
there
was
much
hard
work
and
some
risk
on
a
but
also
much
fun
the
was
appointed
weeks
beforehand
and
all
the
ranchmen
of
the
territory
to
be
covered
by
the
sent
their
representatives
there
were
no
fences
in
the
west
that
i
knew
and
their
place
was
taken
by
the
cowboy
and
the
the
cattle
wandered
free
each
calf
was
branded
with
the
brand
of
the
cow
it
was
following
sometimes
in
winter
there
was
what
we
called
line
riding
that
is
camps
were
established
and
the
line
riders
traveled
a
definite
beat
across
the
desolate
wastes
of
snow
to
and
fro
from
one
camp
to
another
to
prevent
the
cattle
from
drifting
but
as
a
rule
nothing
was
done
to
keep
the
cattle
in
any
one
place
in
the
spring
there
was
a
general
in
each
locality
each
outfit
took
part
in
its
own
and
all
the
outfits
of
a
given
region
combined
to
send
representatives
to
the
two
or
three
that
covered
the
neighborhoods
near
by
into
which
their
cattle
might
drift
for
example
our
little
missouri
generally
worked
down
the
river
from
a
distance
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
miles
above
my
ranch
toward
the
kildeer
mountains
about
the
same
distance
below
in
addition
we
would
usually
send
representatives
to
the
yellowstone
and
to
the
along
the
upper
little
missouri
and
moreover
if
we
heard
that
cattle
had
drifted
perhaps
toward
the
indian
reservation
southeast
of
us
we
would
send
a
wagon
and
rider
after
them
at
the
which
might
be
in
the
valley
of
a
stream
or
in
some
broad
bottom
of
the
river
itself
or
perchance
by
a
couple
of
ponds
under
some
queerly
shaped
butte
that
was
a
landmark
for
the
region
round
about
we
would
all
gather
on
the
appointed
day
the
containing
the
bedding
and
food
each
drawn
by
four
horses
and
driven
by
the
teamster
cook
would
come
jolting
and
rattling
over
the
uneven
sward
accompanying
each
wagon
were
eight
or
ten
riders
the
while
their
horses
a
band
of
a
hundred
or
so
were
driven
by
the
two
herders
one
of
whom
was
known
as
the
day
wrangler
and
one
as
the
night
wrangler
the
men
were
lean
sinewy
fellows
accustomed
to
riding
horses
at
any
speed
over
any
country
by
day
or
by
night
they
wore
flannel
shirts
with
loose
handkerchiefs
knotted
round
their
necks
broad
hats
boots
with
jingling
spurs
and
sometimes
leather
shaps
although
often
they
merely
had
their
trousers
tucked
into
the
tops
of
their
high
boots
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rough
and
as
with
any
other
gathering
of
men
or
boys
of
high
animal
spirits
the
sometimes
became
very
rough
indeed
and
as
the
men
usually
carried
revolvers
and
as
there
were
occasionally
one
or
two
noted
among
them
there
was
now
and
then
a
shooting
affray
a
man
who
was
a
coward
or
who
shirked
his
work
had
a
bad
time
of
course
a
man
could
not
afford
to
let
himself
be
bullied
or
treated
as
a
butt
and
on
the
other
hand
if
he
was
looking
for
a
fight
he
was
certain
to
find
it
but
my
own
experience
was
that
if
a
man
did
not
talk
until
his
associates
knew
him
well
and
liked
him
and
if
he
did
his
work
he
never
had
any
difficulty
in
getting
on
in
my
own
district
i
speedily
grew
to
be
friends
with
most
of
the
men
when
i
went
among
strangers
i
always
had
to
spend
hours
in
living
down
the
fact
that
i
wore
spectacles
remaining
as
long
as
i
could
judiciously
deaf
to
any
side
remarks
about
four
eyes
unless
it
became
evident
that
my
being
quiet
was
misconstrued
and
that
it
was
better
to
bring
matters
to
a
head
at
once
if
for
instance
i
was
sent
off
to
represent
the
little
missouri
brands
on
some
neighboring
such
as
the
yellowstone
i
usually
showed
that
kind
of
diplomacy
which
consists
in
not
uttering
one
word
that
can
be
avoided
i
would
probably
have
a
couple
of
days
solitary
ride
mounted
on
one
horse
and
driving
eight
or
ten
others
before
me
one
of
them
carrying
my
bedding
loose
horses
drive
best
at
a
trot
or
canter
and
if
a
man
is
traveling
alone
in
this
fashion
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
them
reach
the
camp
ground
sufficiently
late
to
make
them
desire
to
feed
and
sleep
where
they
are
until
morning
in
consequence
i
never
spent
more
than
two
days
on
the
journey
from
whatever
the
point
was
at
which
i
left
the
little
missouri
sleeping
the
one
night
for
as
limited
a
number
of
hours
as
possible
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
i
would
find
out
the
wagon
to
which
i
was
assigned
riding
to
it
i
turned
my
horses
into
the
and
reported
to
the
wagon
boss
or
in
his
absence
to
the
cook
always
a
privileged
character
who
was
allowed
and
expected
to
order
men
around
he
would
usually
grumble
savagely
and
profanely
about
my
having
been
put
with
his
wagon
but
this
was
merely
conventional
on
his
part
and
if
i
sat
down
and
said
nothing
he
would
probably
soon
ask
me
if
i
wanted
anything
to
eat
to
which
the
correct
answer
was
that
i
was
not
hungry
and
would
wait
until
the
bedding
rolls
of
the
riders
would
be
strewn
round
the
grass
and
i
would
put
mine
down
a
little
outside
the
ring
where
i
would
not
be
in
any
one
way
with
my
six
or
eight
beside
it
the
men
would
ride
in
laughing
and
talking
with
one
another
and
perhaps
nodding
to
me
one
of
their
number
usually
the
wagon
foreman
might
put
some
question
to
me
as
to
what
brands
i
represented
but
no
other
word
would
be
addressed
to
me
nor
would
i
be
expected
to
volunteer
any
conversation
supper
would
consist
of
bacon
dutch
oven
bread
and
possibly
beef
once
i
won
the
good
graces
of
my
companions
at
the
outset
by
appearing
with
two
antelope
which
i
had
shot
after
supper
i
would
roll
up
in
my
bedding
as
soon
as
possible
and
the
others
would
follow
suit
at
their
pleasure
at
three
in
the
morning
or
thereabouts
at
a
yell
from
the
cook
all
hands
would
turn
hurriedly
out
dressing
was
a
simple
affair
then
each
man
rolled
and
corded
his
bedding
if
he
did
not
the
cook
would
leave
it
behind
and
he
would
go
without
any
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
and
came
to
the
fire
where
he
picked
out
a
tin
cup
tin
plate
and
knife
and
fork
helped
himself
to
coffee
and
to
whatever
food
there
was
and
ate
it
standing
or
squatting
as
best
suited
him
dawn
was
probably
breaking
by
this
time
and
the
trampling
of
unshod
hoofs
showed
that
the
night
wrangler
was
bringing
in
the
pony
herd
two
of
the
men
would
then
run
ropes
from
the
wagon
at
right
angles
to
one
another
and
into
this
as
a
corral
the
horses
would
be
driven
each
man
might
rope
one
of
his
own
horses
or
more
often
point
it
out
to
the
most
skillful
roper
of
the
outfit
who
would
rope
it
for
him
for
if
the
man
was
an
unskillful
roper
and
roped
the
wrong
horse
or
roped
the
horse
in
the
wrong
place
there
was
a
chance
of
the
whole
herd
stampeding
each
man
then
saddled
and
bridled
his
horse
this
was
usually
followed
by
some
resolute
bucking
on
the
part
of
two
or
three
of
the
horses
especially
in
the
early
days
of
each
the
bucking
was
always
a
source
of
amusement
to
all
the
men
whose
horses
did
not
buck
and
these
fortunate
ones
would
gather
round
giving
ironical
advice
and
especially
adjuring
the
rider
not
to
go
to
leather
that
is
not
to
steady
himself
in
the
saddle
by
catching
hold
of
the
as
soon
as
the
men
had
mounted
the
whole
outfit
started
on
the
long
circle
the
morning
circle
usually
the
ranch
foreman
who
bossed
a
given
wagon
was
put
in
charge
of
the
men
of
one
group
by
the
foreman
he
might
keep
his
men
together
until
they
had
gone
some
ten
or
fifteen
miles
from
camp
and
then
drop
them
in
couples
at
different
points
each
couple
made
its
way
toward
the
wagon
gathering
all
the
cattle
it
could
find
the
morning
ride
might
last
six
or
eight
hours
and
it
was
still
longer
before
some
of
the
men
got
in
singly
and
in
twos
and
threes
they
appeared
from
every
quarter
of
the
horizon
the
dust
rising
from
the
hoofs
of
the
steers
and
bulls
the
cows
and
calves
they
had
collected
two
or
three
of
the
men
were
left
to
take
care
of
the
herd
while
the
others
changed
horses
ate
a
hasty
dinner
and
then
came
out
to
the
afternoon
work
this
consisted
of
each
man
in
succession
being
sent
into
the
herd
usually
with
a
companion
to
cut
out
the
cows
of
his
brand
or
brands
which
were
followed
by
unbranded
calves
and
also
to
cut
out
any
mavericks
or
unbranded
yearlings
we
worked
each
animal
gently
out
to
the
edge
of
the
herd
and
then
with
a
sudden
dash
took
it
off
at
a
run
it
was
always
desperately
anxious
to
break
back
and
rejoin
the
herd
there
was
much
breakneck
galloping
and
twisting
and
turning
before
its
desire
was
thwarted
and
it
was
driven
to
join
the
rest
of
the
cut
that
is
the
other
animals
which
had
been
cut
out
and
which
were
being
held
by
one
or
two
other
men
cattle
hate
being
alone
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
hold
the
first
one
or
two
that
were
cut
out
but
soon
they
got
a
little
herd
of
their
own
and
then
they
were
contented
when
the
cutting
out
had
all
been
done
the
calves
were
branded
and
all
misadventures
of
the
calf
wrestlers
the
men
who
seized
threw
and
held
each
calf
when
roped
by
the
mounted
roper
were
hailed
with
yelling
laughter
then
the
animals
which
for
one
reason
or
another
it
was
desired
to
drive
along
with
the
were
put
into
one
herd
and
left
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
night
guards
and
the
rest
of
us
would
loaf
back
to
the
wagon
for
supper
and
bed
by
this
time
i
would
have
been
accepted
as
one
of
the
rest
of
the
outfit
and
all
strangeness
would
have
passed
off
the
attitude
of
my
fellow
being
one
of
friendly
forgiveness
even
toward
my
spectacles
night
guards
for
the
cattle
herd
were
then
assigned
by
the
captain
of
the
wagon
or
perhaps
by
the
foreman
according
to
the
needs
of
the
case
the
guards
standing
for
two
hours
at
a
time
from
eight
in
the
evening
till
four
in
the
morning
the
first
and
last
watches
were
preferable
because
sleep
was
not
broken
as
in
both
of
the
other
two
if
things
went
well
the
cattle
would
soon
bed
down
and
nothing
further
would
occur
until
morning
when
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
work
the
wagon
moving
each
day
eight
or
ten
miles
to
some
appointed
each
man
would
picket
his
night
horse
near
the
wagon
usually
choosing
the
quietest
animal
in
his
string
for
that
purpose
because
to
saddle
and
mount
a
mean
horse
at
night
is
not
pleasant
when
utterly
tired
it
was
hard
to
have
to
get
up
for
one
trick
at
night
herd
nevertheless
on
ordinary
nights
the
two
hours
round
the
cattle
in
the
still
darkness
were
pleasant
the
loneliness
under
the
vast
empty
sky
and
the
silence
in
which
the
breathing
of
the
cattle
sounded
loud
and
the
alert
readiness
to
meet
any
emergency
which
might
suddenly
arise
out
of
the
formless
night
all
combined
to
give
one
a
sense
of
subdued
interest
then
one
soon
got
to
know
the
cattle
of
marked
individuality
the
ones
that
led
the
others
into
mischief
and
one
also
grew
to
recognize
the
traits
they
all
possessed
in
common
and
the
impulses
which
for
instance
made
a
whole
herd
get
up
towards
midnight
each
beast
turning
round
and
then
lying
down
again
but
by
the
end
of
the
watch
each
rider
had
studied
the
cattle
until
it
grew
monotonous
and
heartily
welcomed
his
relief
guard
a
newcomer
of
course
had
any
amount
to
learn
and
sometimes
the
simplest
things
were
those
which
brought
him
to
grief
one
night
early
in
my
career
i
failed
satisfactorily
to
identify
the
direction
in
which
i
was
to
go
in
order
to
reach
the
night
herd
it
was
a
night
i
managed
to
get
started
wrong
and
i
never
found
either
the
herd
or
the
wagon
again
until
sunrise
when
i
was
greeted
with
withering
scorn
by
the
injured
who
had
been
obliged
to
stand
double
guard
because
i
failed
to
relieve
him
there
were
other
misadventures
that
i
met
with
where
the
excuse
was
greater
the
punchers
on
night
guard
usually
rode
round
the
cattle
in
reverse
directions
calling
and
singing
to
them
if
the
beasts
seemed
restless
to
keep
them
quiet
on
rare
occasions
something
happened
that
made
the
cattle
stampede
and
then
the
duty
of
the
riders
was
to
keep
with
them
as
long
as
possible
and
try
gradually
to
get
control
of
them
one
night
there
was
a
heavy
storm
and
all
of
us
who
were
at
the
wagons
were
obliged
to
turn
out
hastily
to
help
the
night
herders
after
a
while
there
was
a
terrific
peal
of
thunder
the
lightning
struck
right
by
the
herd
and
away
all
the
beasts
went
heads
and
horns
and
tails
in
the
air
for
a
minute
or
two
i
could
make
out
nothing
except
the
dark
forms
of
the
beasts
running
on
every
side
of
me
and
i
should
have
been
very
sorry
if
my
horse
had
stumbled
for
those
behind
would
have
trodden
me
down
then
the
herd
split
part
going
to
one
side
while
the
other
part
seemingly
kept
straight
ahead
and
i
galloped
as
hard
as
ever
beside
them
i
was
trying
to
reach
the
point
the
leading
animals
in
order
to
turn
them
when
suddenly
there
was
a
tremendous
splashing
in
front
i
could
dimly
make
out
that
the
cattle
immediately
ahead
and
to
one
side
of
me
were
disappearing
and
the
next
moment
the
horse
and
i
went
off
a
cut
bank
into
the
little
missouri
i
bent
away
back
in
the
saddle
and
though
the
horse
almost
went
down
he
just
recovered
himself
and
plunging
and
struggling
through
water
and
quicksand
we
made
the
other
side
here
i
discovered
that
there
was
another
cowboy
with
the
same
part
of
the
herd
that
i
was
with
but
almost
immediately
we
separated
i
galloped
hard
through
a
bottom
covered
with
big
cottonwood
trees
and
stopped
the
part
of
the
herd
that
i
was
with
but
very
soon
they
broke
on
me
again
and
repeated
this
twice
finally
toward
morning
the
few
i
had
left
came
to
a
halt
it
had
been
raining
hard
for
some
time
i
got
off
my
horse
and
leaned
against
a
tree
but
before
long
the
infernal
cattle
started
on
again
and
i
had
to
ride
after
them
dawn
came
soon
after
this
and
i
was
able
to
make
out
where
i
was
and
head
the
cattle
back
collecting
other
little
bunches
as
i
went
after
a
while
i
came
on
a
cowboy
on
foot
carrying
his
saddle
on
his
head
he
was
my
companion
of
the
previous
night
his
horse
had
gone
full
speed
into
a
tree
and
killed
itself
the
man
however
not
being
hurt
i
could
not
help
him
as
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
handle
the
cattle
when
i
got
them
to
the
wagon
most
of
the
other
men
had
already
come
in
and
the
riders
were
just
starting
on
the
long
circle
one
of
the
men
changed
my
horse
for
me
while
i
ate
a
hasty
breakfast
and
then
we
were
off
for
the
day
work
as
only
about
half
of
the
night
herd
had
been
brought
back
the
circle
riding
was
particularly
heavy
and
it
was
ten
hours
before
we
were
back
at
the
wagon
we
then
changed
horses
again
and
worked
the
whole
herd
until
after
sunset
finishing
just
as
it
grew
too
dark
to
do
anything
more
by
this
time
i
had
been
nearly
forty
hours
in
the
saddle
changing
horses
five
times
and
my
clothes
had
thoroughly
dried
on
me
and
i
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
i
touched
the
bedding
fortunately
some
men
who
had
gotten
in
late
in
the
morning
had
had
their
sleep
during
the
daytime
so
that
the
rest
of
us
escaped
night
guard
and
were
not
called
until
four
next
morning
nobody
ever
gets
enough
sleep
on
a
the
above
was
the
longest
number
of
consecutive
hours
i
ever
had
to
be
in
the
saddle
but
as
i
have
said
i
changed
horses
five
times
and
it
is
a
great
lightening
of
labor
for
a
rider
to
have
a
fresh
horse
once
when
with
sylvane
ferris
i
spent
about
sixteen
hours
on
one
horse
riding
seventy
or
eighty
miles
the
had
reached
a
place
called
the
of
the
little
missouri
and
we
had
to
ride
there
do
some
work
around
the
cattle
and
ride
back
another
time
i
was
hours
on
horseback
in
company
with
merrifield
without
changing
horses
on
this
occasion
we
did
not
travel
fast
we
had
been
coming
back
with
the
wagon
from
a
hunting
trip
in
the
big
horn
mountains
the
team
was
fagged
out
and
we
were
tired
of
walking
at
a
snail
pace
beside
it
when
we
reached
country
that
the
driver
thoroughly
knew
we
thought
it
safe
to
leave
him
and
we
loped
in
one
night
across
a
distance
which
it
took
the
wagon
the
three
following
days
to
cover
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
ride
was
delightful
all
day
long
we
had
plodded
at
a
walk
weary
and
hot
at
supper
time
we
had
rested
two
or
three
hours
and
the
tough
little
riding
horses
seemed
as
fresh
as
ever
it
was
in
september
as
we
rode
out
of
the
circle
of
the
firelight
the
air
was
cool
in
our
faces
under
the
bright
moonlight
and
then
under
the
starlight
we
loped
and
cantered
mile
after
mile
over
the
high
prairie
we
passed
bands
of
antelope
and
herds
of
texas
cattle
and
at
last
just
as
the
first
red
beams
of
the
sun
flamed
over
the
bluffs
in
front
of
us
we
rode
down
into
the
valley
of
the
little
missouri
where
our
ranch
house
stood
i
never
became
a
good
roper
nor
more
than
an
average
rider
according
to
ranch
standards
of
course
a
man
on
a
ranch
has
to
ride
a
good
many
bad
horses
and
is
bound
to
encounter
a
certain
number
of
accidents
and
of
these
i
had
my
share
at
one
time
cracking
a
rib
and
on
another
occasion
the
point
of
my
shoulder
we
were
hundreds
of
miles
from
a
doctor
and
each
time
as
i
was
on
the
i
had
to
get
through
my
work
for
the
next
few
weeks
as
best
i
could
until
the
injury
healed
of
itself
when
i
had
the
opportunity
i
broke
my
own
horses
doing
it
gently
and
gradually
and
spending
much
time
over
it
and
choosing
the
horses
that
seemed
gentle
to
begin
with
with
these
horses
i
never
had
any
difficulty
but
frequently
there
was
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
handle
our
mounts
so
elaborately
we
might
get
a
band
of
horses
each
having
been
bridled
and
saddled
two
or
three
times
but
none
of
them
having
been
broken
beyond
the
extent
implied
in
this
bridling
and
saddling
then
each
of
us
in
succession
would
choose
a
horse
for
his
string
i
as
owner
of
the
ranch
being
given
the
first
choice
on
each
round
so
to
speak
the
first
time
i
was
ever
on
a
sylvane
ferris
merrifield
meyer
and
i
each
chose
his
string
in
this
fashion
three
or
four
of
the
animals
i
got
were
not
easy
to
ride
the
effort
both
to
ride
them
and
to
look
as
if
i
enjoyed
doing
so
on
some
cool
morning
when
my
grinning
cowboy
friends
had
gathered
round
to
see
whether
the
bay
could
buck
the
boss
off
doubtless
was
of
benefit
to
me
but
lacked
much
of
being
enjoyable
the
time
i
smashed
my
rib
i
was
bucked
off
on
a
stone
the
time
i
hurt
the
point
of
my
shoulder
i
was
riding
a
big
sulky
horse
named
ben
butler
which
went
over
backwards
with
me
when
we
got
up
it
still
refused
to
go
anywhere
so
while
i
sat
it
sylvane
ferris
and
george
meyer
got
their
ropes
on
its
neck
and
dragged
it
a
few
hundred
yards
choking
but
stubborn
all
four
feet
firmly
planted
and
plowing
the
ground
when
they
released
the
ropes
it
lay
down
and
would
get
up
the
had
started
so
sylvane
gave
me
his
horse
baldy
which
sometimes
bucked
but
never
went
over
backwards
and
he
got
on
the
now
rearisen
ben
butler
to
my
discomfiture
ben
started
quietly
beside
us
while
sylvane
remarked
why
there
nothing
the
matter
with
this
horse
he
a
plumb
gentle
horse
then
ben
fell
slightly
behind
and
i
heard
sylvane
again
all
right
come
along
here
you
go
on
you
hi
hi
fellows
help
me
out
he
lying
on
me
sure
enough
he
was
and
when
we
dragged
sylvane
from
under
him
the
first
thing
the
rescued
sylvane
did
was
to
execute
a
spurs
and
all
on
the
iniquitous
ben
we
could
do
nothing
with
him
that
day
subsequently
we
got
him
so
that
we
could
ride
him
but
he
never
became
a
nice
as
with
all
other
forms
of
work
so
on
the
a
man
of
ordinary
power
who
nevertheless
does
not
shirk
things
merely
because
they
are
disagreeable
or
irksome
soon
earns
his
place
there
were
crack
riders
and
ropers
who
just
because
they
felt
such
overweening
pride
in
their
own
prowess
were
not
really
very
valuable
men
continually
on
the
circles
a
cow
or
a
calf
would
get
into
some
thick
patch
of
bulberry
bush
and
refuse
to
come
out
or
when
it
was
getting
late
we
would
pass
some
bad
lands
that
would
probably
not
contain
cattle
but
might
or
a
steer
would
turn
fighting
mad
or
a
calf
grow
tired
and
want
to
lie
down
if
in
such
a
case
the
man
steadily
persists
in
doing
the
unattractive
thing
and
after
two
hours
of
exasperation
and
harassment
does
finally
get
the
cow
out
and
keep
her
out
of
the
bulberry
bushes
and
drives
her
to
the
wagon
or
finds
some
animals
that
have
been
passed
by
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
patch
of
bad
lands
he
hunts
through
or
gets
the
calf
up
on
his
saddle
and
takes
it
in
anyhow
the
foreman
soon
grows
to
treat
him
as
having
his
uses
and
as
being
an
asset
of
worth
in
the
even
though
neither
a
fancy
roper
nor
a
fancy
rider
when
at
the
progressive
convention
last
august
i
met
george
meyer
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
and
he
recalled
to
me
an
incident
on
one
where
we
happened
to
be
thrown
together
while
driving
some
cows
and
calves
to
camp
when
the
camp
was
only
just
across
the
river
two
of
the
calves
positively
refused
to
go
any
further
he
took
one
of
them
in
his
arms
and
after
some
hazardous
maneuvering
managed
to
get
on
his
horse
in
spite
of
the
objections
of
the
latter
and
rode
into
the
river
my
calf
was
too
big
for
such
treatment
so
in
despair
i
roped
it
intending
to
drag
it
over
however
as
soon
as
i
roped
it
the
calf
started
bouncing
and
bleating
and
owing
to
some
lack
of
dexterity
on
my
part
suddenly
swung
round
the
rear
of
the
horse
bringing
the
rope
under
his
tail
down
went
the
tail
tight
and
the
horse
went
into
figures
as
the
phrase
of
that
day
was
there
was
a
cut
bank
about
four
feet
high
on
the
hither
side
of
the
river
and
over
this
the
horse
bucked
we
went
into
the
water
with
a
splash
with
a
pluck
the
calf
followed
described
a
parabola
in
the
air
and
landed
beside
us
fortunately
this
took
the
rope
out
from
under
the
horse
tail
but
left
him
thoroughly
frightened
he
could
not
do
much
bucking
in
the
stream
for
there
were
one
or
two
places
where
we
had
to
swim
and
the
shallows
were
either
sandy
or
muddy
but
across
we
went
at
speed
and
the
calf
made
a
wake
like
pharaoh
army
in
the
red
sea
on
several
occasions
we
had
to
fight
fire
in
the
geography
books
of
my
youth
prairie
fires
were
always
portrayed
as
taking
place
in
long
grass
and
all
living
things
ran
before
them
on
the
northern
cattle
plains
the
grass
was
never
long
enough
to
be
a
source
of
danger
to
man
or
beast
the
fires
were
nothing
like
the
forest
fires
in
the
northern
woods
but
they
destroyed
large
quantities
of
feed
and
we
had
to
stop
them
where
possible
the
process
we
usually
followed
was
to
kill
a
steer
split
it
in
two
lengthwise
and
then
have
two
riders
drag
each
the
rope
of
one
running
from
his
to
the
front
leg
and
that
of
the
other
to
the
hind
leg
one
of
the
men
would
spur
his
horse
over
or
through
the
line
of
fire
and
the
two
would
then
ride
forward
dragging
the
steer
bloody
side
downward
along
the
line
of
flame
men
following
on
foot
with
slickers
or
wet
to
beat
out
any
flickering
blaze
that
was
still
left
it
was
exciting
work
for
the
fire
and
the
twitching
and
plucking
of
the
ox
carcass
over
the
uneven
ground
maddened
the
fierce
little
horses
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
some
riding
in
order
to
keep
them
to
their
work
after
a
while
it
also
became
very
exhausting
the
thirst
and
fatigue
being
great
as
with
parched
lips
and
blackened
from
head
to
foot
we
toiled
at
our
task
in
those
years
the
stockman
association
of
montana
was
a
powerful
body
i
was
the
delegate
to
it
from
the
little
missouri
the
meetings
that
i
attended
were
held
in
miles
city
at
that
time
a
typical
cow
town
stockmen
of
all
kinds
attended
including
the
biggest
men
in
the
stock
business
men
like
old
conrad
kohrs
who
was
and
is
the
finest
type
of
pioneer
in
all
the
rocky
mountain
country
and
granville
stewart
who
was
afterwards
appointed
minister
by
cleveland
i
think
to
the
argentine
and
hashknife
simpson
a
texan
who
had
brought
his
cattle
the
hashknife
brand
up
the
trail
into
our
country
he
and
i
grew
to
be
great
friends
i
can
see
him
now
the
first
time
we
met
grinning
at
me
as
none
too
comfortable
i
sat
a
horse
at
the
edge
of
a
cattle
herd
we
were
working
his
son
sloan
simpson
went
to
harvard
was
one
of
the
men
in
my
regiment
and
afterwards
held
my
commission
as
postmaster
at
dallas
at
the
stockmen
meeting
in
miles
city
in
addition
to
the
big
stockmen
there
were
always
hundreds
of
cowboys
galloping
up
and
down
the
wide
dusty
streets
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
it
was
a
picturesque
sight
during
the
three
days
the
meetings
lasted
there
was
always
at
least
one
big
dance
at
the
hotel
there
were
few
dress
suits
but
there
was
perfect
decorum
at
the
dance
and
in
the
square
dances
most
of
the
men
knew
the
figures
far
better
than
i
did
with
such
a
crowd
in
town
sleeping
accommodations
of
any
sort
were
at
a
premium
and
in
the
hotel
there
were
two
men
in
every
bed
on
one
occasion
i
had
a
roommate
whom
i
never
saw
because
he
always
went
to
bed
much
later
than
i
did
and
i
always
got
up
much
earlier
than
he
did
on
the
last
day
however
he
rose
at
the
same
time
and
i
saw
that
he
was
a
man
i
knew
named
carter
and
nicknamed
modesty
carter
he
was
a
stalwart
fellow
and
i
was
sorry
when
later
i
heard
that
he
had
been
killed
in
a
shooting
row
when
i
went
west
the
last
great
indian
wars
had
just
come
to
an
end
but
there
were
still
sporadic
outbreaks
here
and
there
and
occasionally
bands
of
marauding
young
braves
were
a
menace
to
outlying
and
lonely
settlements
many
of
the
white
men
were
themselves
lawless
and
brutal
and
prone
to
commit
outrages
on
the
indians
unfortunately
each
race
tended
to
hold
all
the
members
of
the
other
race
responsible
for
the
misdeeds
of
a
few
so
that
the
crime
of
the
miscreant
red
or
white
who
committed
the
original
outrage
too
often
invited
retaliation
upon
entirely
innocent
people
and
this
action
would
in
its
turn
arouse
bitter
feeling
which
found
vent
in
still
more
indiscriminate
retaliation
the
first
year
i
was
on
the
little
missouri
some
sioux
bucks
ran
off
all
the
horses
of
a
outfit
one
of
the
tried
to
get
even
by
stealing
the
horses
of
a
cheyenne
hunting
party
and
when
pursued
made
for
a
cow
camp
with
as
a
result
a
skirmish
between
the
cowboys
and
the
cheyennes
one
of
the
latter
was
wounded
but
this
particular
wounded
man
seemed
to
have
more
sense
than
the
other
participants
in
the
chain
of
and
discriminated
among
the
whites
he
came
into
our
camp
and
had
his
wound
dressed
a
year
later
i
was
at
a
desolate
little
mud
road
ranch
on
the
deadwood
trail
it
was
kept
by
a
very
capable
and
very
forceful
woman
with
sound
ideas
of
justice
and
abundantly
well
able
to
hold
her
own
her
husband
was
a
worthless
devil
who
finally
got
drunk
on
some
whisky
he
obtained
from
an
outfit
of
missouri
that
is
freighters
driving
ox
wagons
under
the
stimulus
of
the
whisky
he
picked
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
and
attempted
to
beat
her
she
knocked
him
down
with
a
lifter
and
the
admiring
bore
him
off
leaving
the
lady
in
full
possession
of
the
ranch
when
i
visited
her
she
had
a
man
named
crow
joe
working
for
her
a
person
who
later
as
i
heard
my
foreman
explain
skipped
the
country
with
a
bunch
of
horses
the
mistress
of
the
ranch
made
buckskin
shirts
of
great
durability
the
one
she
made
for
me
and
which
i
used
for
years
was
used
by
one
of
my
sons
in
arizona
a
couple
of
winters
ago
i
had
ridden
down
into
the
country
after
some
lost
horses
and
visited
the
ranch
to
get
her
to
make
me
the
buckskin
shirt
in
question
there
were
at
the
moment
three
indians
there
sioux
well
behaved
and
and
she
explained
to
me
that
they
had
been
resting
there
waiting
for
dinner
and
that
a
white
man
had
come
along
and
tried
to
run
off
their
horses
the
indians
were
on
the
lookout
however
and
running
out
they
caught
the
man
but
after
retaking
their
horses
and
depriving
him
of
his
gun
they
let
him
go
i
do
see
why
they
let
him
go
exclaimed
my
hostess
i
do
believe
in
stealing
indians
horses
any
more
than
white
folks
so
i
told
they
could
go
along
and
hang
him
i
never
cheep
anyhow
i
wo
charge
them
anything
for
their
dinner
concluded
my
hostess
she
was
in
advance
of
the
usual
morality
of
the
time
and
place
which
drew
a
sharp
line
between
stealing
citizens
horses
and
stealing
horses
from
the
government
or
the
indians
a
fairly
decent
citizen
jap
hunt
who
long
ago
met
a
violent
death
exemplified
this
attitude
towards
indians
in
some
remarks
i
once
heard
him
make
he
had
started
a
horse
ranch
and
had
quite
honestly
purchased
a
number
of
horses
of
different
brands
with
the
view
of
doctoring
them
and
selling
them
again
about
this
time
there
had
been
much
and
in
our
territory
and
in
montana
and
under
the
direction
of
some
of
the
big
a
committee
of
vigilantes
had
been
organized
to
take
action
against
the
rustlers
as
the
horse
thieves
and
cattle
thieves
were
called
the
vigilantes
or
stranglers
as
they
were
locally
known
did
their
work
thoroughly
but
as
always
happens
with
bodies
of
the
kind
toward
the
end
they
grew
reckless
in
their
actions
paid
off
private
grudges
and
hung
men
on
slight
provocation
riding
into
jap
hunt
ranch
they
nearly
hung
him
because
he
had
so
many
horses
of
different
brands
he
was
finally
let
off
he
was
much
upset
by
the
incident
and
explained
again
and
again
the
idea
of
saying
that
i
was
a
horse
thief
why
i
never
stole
a
horse
in
my
life
leastways
from
a
white
man
i
do
count
indians
nor
the
government
of
course
jap
had
been
reared
among
men
still
in
the
stage
of
tribal
morality
and
while
they
recognized
their
obligations
to
one
another
both
the
government
and
the
indians
seemed
alien
bodies
in
regard
to
which
the
laws
of
morality
did
not
apply
on
the
other
hand
parties
of
savage
young
bucks
would
treat
lonely
settlers
just
as
badly
and
in
addition
sometimes
murder
them
such
a
party
was
generally
composed
of
young
fellows
burning
to
distinguish
themselves
some
one
of
their
number
would
have
obtained
a
pass
from
the
indian
agent
allowing
him
to
travel
off
the
reservation
which
pass
would
be
flourished
whenever
their
action
was
questioned
by
bodies
of
whites
of
equal
strength
i
once
had
a
trifling
encounter
with
such
a
band
i
was
making
my
way
along
the
edge
of
the
bad
lands
northward
from
my
lower
ranch
and
was
just
crossing
a
plateau
when
five
indians
rode
up
over
the
further
rim
the
instant
they
saw
me
they
whipped
out
their
guns
and
raced
full
speed
at
me
yelling
and
flogging
their
horses
i
was
on
a
favorite
horse
manitou
who
was
a
wise
old
fellow
with
nerves
not
to
be
shaken
by
anything
i
at
once
leaped
off
him
and
stood
with
my
rifle
ready
it
was
possible
that
the
indians
were
merely
making
a
bluff
and
intended
no
mischief
but
i
did
not
like
their
actions
and
i
thought
it
likely
that
if
i
allowed
them
to
get
hold
of
me
they
would
at
least
take
my
horse
and
rifle
and
possibly
kill
me
so
i
waited
until
they
were
a
hundred
yards
off
and
then
drew
a
bead
on
the
first
indians
and
for
the
matter
of
that
white
men
do
not
like
to
ride
in
on
a
man
who
is
cool
and
means
shooting
and
in
a
twinkling
every
man
was
lying
over
the
side
of
his
horse
and
all
five
had
turned
and
were
galloping
backwards
having
altered
their
course
as
quickly
as
so
many
teal
ducks
after
this
one
of
them
made
the
peace
sign
with
his
blanket
first
and
then
as
he
rode
toward
me
with
his
open
hand
i
halted
him
at
a
fair
distance
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
he
exclaimed
how
me
good
injun
me
good
injun
and
tried
to
show
me
the
dirty
piece
of
paper
on
which
his
agency
pass
was
written
i
told
him
with
sincerity
that
i
was
glad
that
he
was
a
good
indian
but
that
he
must
not
come
any
closer
he
then
asked
for
sugar
and
tobacco
i
told
him
i
had
none
another
indian
began
slowly
drifting
toward
me
in
spite
of
my
calling
out
to
keep
back
so
i
once
more
aimed
with
my
rifle
whereupon
both
indians
slipped
to
the
other
side
of
their
horses
and
galloped
off
with
oaths
that
did
credit
to
at
least
one
side
of
their
acquaintance
with
english
i
now
mounted
and
pushed
over
the
plateau
on
to
the
open
prairie
in
those
days
an
indian
although
not
as
good
a
shot
as
a
white
man
was
infinitely
better
at
crawling
under
and
taking
advantage
of
cover
and
the
worst
thing
a
white
man
could
do
was
to
get
into
cover
whereas
out
in
the
open
if
he
kept
his
head
he
had
a
good
chance
of
standing
off
even
half
a
dozen
assailants
the
indians
accompanied
me
for
a
couple
of
miles
then
i
reached
the
open
prairie
and
resumed
my
northward
ride
not
being
further
molested
in
the
old
days
in
the
ranch
country
we
depended
upon
game
for
fresh
meat
nobody
liked
to
kill
a
beef
and
although
now
and
then
a
maverick
yearling
might
be
killed
on
the
most
of
us
looked
askance
at
the
deed
because
if
the
practice
of
was
ever
allowed
to
start
the
rustlers
the
horse
thieves
and
cattle
thieves
would
be
sure
to
seize
on
it
as
an
excuse
for
general
slaughter
getting
meat
for
the
ranch
usually
devolved
upon
me
i
almost
always
carried
a
rifle
when
i
rode
either
in
a
scabbard
under
my
thigh
or
across
the
pommel
often
i
would
pick
up
a
deer
or
antelope
while
about
my
regular
work
when
visiting
a
line
camp
or
riding
after
the
cattle
at
other
times
i
would
make
a
day
trip
after
them
in
the
fall
we
sometimes
took
a
wagon
and
made
a
week
hunt
returning
with
eight
or
ten
deer
carcasses
and
perhaps
an
elk
or
a
mountain
sheep
as
well
i
never
became
more
than
a
fair
hunter
and
at
times
i
had
most
exasperating
experiences
either
failing
to
see
game
which
i
ought
to
have
seen
or
committing
some
blunder
in
the
stalk
or
failing
to
kill
when
i
fired
looking
back
i
am
inclined
to
say
that
if
i
had
any
good
quality
as
a
hunter
it
was
that
of
perseverance
it
is
dogged
that
does
it
in
hunting
as
in
many
other
things
unless
in
wholly
exceptional
cases
when
we
were
very
hungry
i
never
killed
anything
but
bucks
occasionally
i
made
long
trips
away
from
the
ranch
and
among
the
rocky
mountains
with
my
ranch
foreman
merrifield
or
in
later
years
with
tazewell
woody
john
willis
or
john
goff
we
hunted
bears
both
the
black
and
the
grizzly
cougars
and
wolves
and
moose
wapiti
and
white
goat
on
one
of
these
trips
i
killed
a
bison
bull
and
i
also
killed
a
bison
bull
on
the
little
missouri
some
fifty
miles
south
of
my
ranch
on
a
trip
which
joe
ferris
and
i
took
together
it
was
rather
a
rough
trip
each
of
us
carried
only
his
slicker
behind
him
on
the
saddle
with
some
flour
and
bacon
done
up
in
it
we
met
with
all
kinds
of
misadventures
finally
one
night
when
we
were
sleeping
by
a
slimy
little
prairie
pool
where
there
was
not
a
stick
of
wood
we
had
to
tie
the
horses
to
the
horns
of
our
saddles
and
then
we
went
to
sleep
with
our
heads
on
the
saddles
in
the
middle
of
the
night
something
stampeded
the
horses
and
away
they
went
with
the
saddles
after
them
as
we
jumped
to
our
feet
joe
eyed
me
with
an
evident
suspicion
that
i
was
the
jonah
of
the
party
and
said
o
lord
i
never
done
anything
to
deserve
this
did
you
ever
do
anything
to
deserve
this
in
addition
to
my
private
duties
i
sometimes
served
as
deputy
sheriff
for
the
northern
end
of
our
county
the
sheriff
and
i
crisscrossed
in
our
public
and
private
relations
he
often
worked
for
me
as
a
hired
hand
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
his
deputy
his
name
or
at
least
the
name
he
went
by
was
bill
jones
and
as
there
were
in
the
neighborhood
several
bill
joneses
three
seven
bill
jones
texas
bill
jones
and
the
like
the
sheriff
was
known
as
hell
roaring
bill
jones
he
was
a
thorough
frontiersman
excellent
in
all
kinds
of
emergencies
and
a
very
game
man
i
became
much
attached
to
him
he
was
a
thoroughly
good
citizen
when
sober
but
he
was
a
little
wild
when
drunk
unfortunately
toward
the
end
of
his
life
he
got
to
drinking
very
heavily
when
in
john
burroughs
and
i
visited
the
yellowstone
park
poor
bill
jones
very
much
down
in
the
world
was
driving
a
team
in
gardiner
outside
the
park
i
had
looked
forward
to
seeing
him
and
he
was
equally
anxious
to
see
me
he
kept
telling
his
cronies
of
our
intimacy
and
of
what
we
were
going
to
do
together
and
then
got
drinking
and
the
result
was
that
by
the
time
i
reached
gardiner
he
had
to
be
carried
out
and
left
in
the
when
i
came
out
of
the
park
i
sent
on
in
advance
to
tell
them
to
be
sure
to
keep
him
sober
and
they
did
so
but
it
was
a
rather
sad
interview
the
old
fellow
had
gone
to
pieces
and
soon
after
i
left
he
got
lost
in
a
blizzard
and
was
dead
when
they
found
him
bill
jones
was
a
and
also
a
good
man
with
his
fists
on
one
occasion
there
was
an
election
in
town
there
had
been
many
threats
that
the
party
of
disorder
would
import
section
hands
from
the
neighboring
railway
stations
to
down
our
side
i
did
not
reach
medora
the
forlorn
little
cattle
town
which
was
our
county
seat
until
the
election
was
well
under
way
i
then
asked
one
of
my
friends
if
there
had
been
any
disorder
bill
jones
was
standing
by
disorder
hell
said
my
friend
bill
jones
just
stood
there
with
one
hand
on
his
gun
and
the
other
pointing
over
toward
the
new
jail
whenever
any
man
who
did
have
a
right
to
vote
came
near
the
polls
there
was
only
one
of
them
tried
to
vote
and
bill
knocked
him
down
lord
added
my
friend
meditatively
the
way
that
man
fell
well
struck
in
bill
jones
if
he
fell
i
have
walked
round
behind
him
to
see
what
was
propping
him
up
in
the
days
when
i
lived
on
the
ranch
i
usually
spent
most
of
the
winter
in
the
east
and
when
i
returned
in
the
early
spring
i
was
always
interested
in
finding
out
what
had
happened
since
my
departure
on
one
occasion
i
was
met
by
bill
jones
and
sylvane
ferris
and
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
they
mentioned
the
lunatic
this
led
to
a
question
on
my
part
and
sylvane
ferris
began
the
story
well
you
see
he
was
on
a
train
and
he
shot
the
newsboy
at
first
they
were
going
to
do
anything
to
him
for
they
thought
he
just
had
it
in
for
the
newsboy
but
then
somebody
said
he
plumb
crazy
and
he
liable
to
shoot
any
of
us
and
then
they
threw
him
off
the
train
it
was
here
at
medora
and
they
asked
if
anybody
would
take
care
of
him
and
bill
jones
said
he
would
because
he
was
the
sheriff
and
the
jail
had
two
rooms
and
he
was
living
in
one
and
would
put
the
lunatic
in
the
other
here
bill
jones
interrupted
yes
and
more
fool
me
i
would
take
charge
of
another
lunatic
if
the
whole
county
asked
me
why
with
the
air
of
a
man
announcing
an
astounding
discovery
that
lunatic
did
have
his
right
senses
he
would
eat
till
me
and
snyder
got
him
down
on
the
shavings
and
made
him
eat
snyder
was
a
huge
pennsylvania
dutchman
and
was
bill
jones
chief
deputy
bill
continued
you
know
snyder
he
is
well
he
think
that
lunatic
looked
peaked
and
he
take
him
out
for
an
airing
then
the
boys
would
get
joshing
him
as
to
how
much
start
he
could
give
him
over
the
prairie
and
catch
him
again
apparently
the
amount
of
the
start
given
the
lunatic
depended
upon
the
amount
of
the
bet
to
which
the
joshing
led
up
i
asked
bill
what
he
would
have
done
if
snyder
caught
the
lunatic
this
was
evidently
a
new
idea
and
he
responded
that
snyder
always
did
catch
him
well
but
suppose
he
had
caught
him
well
said
bill
jones
if
snyder
had
caught
the
lunatic
i
have
whaled
hell
out
of
snyder
under
these
circumstances
snyder
ran
his
best
and
always
did
catch
the
patient
it
must
not
be
gathered
from
this
that
the
lunatic
was
badly
treated
he
was
well
treated
he
become
greatly
attached
to
both
bill
jones
and
snyder
and
he
objected
strongly
when
after
the
frontier
theory
of
treatment
of
the
insane
had
received
a
full
trial
he
was
finally
sent
off
to
the
territorial
capital
it
was
merely
that
all
the
relations
of
life
in
that
place
and
day
were
so
managed
as
to
give
ample
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
individuality
whether
in
sheriff
or
ranchman
the
local
practical
joker
once
attempted
to
have
some
fun
at
the
expense
of
the
lunatic
and
bill
jones
described
the
result
you
know
bixby
do
you
well
with
deep
disapproval
bixby
thinks
he
is
funny
he
does
he
come
and
he
wake
that
lunatic
up
at
night
and
i
have
to
get
up
and
soothe
him
i
fixed
bixby
all
right
though
i
fastened
a
rope
on
the
latch
and
next
time
bixby
came
i
let
the
lunatic
out
on
him
he
bit
bixby
nose
off
i
learned
bixby
bill
jones
had
been
unconventional
in
other
relations
besides
that
of
sheriff
he
once
casually
mentioned
to
me
that
he
had
served
on
the
police
force
of
bismarck
but
he
had
left
because
he
beat
the
mayor
over
the
head
with
his
gun
one
day
he
added
the
mayor
he
mind
it
but
the
superintendent
of
police
said
he
guessed
i
better
resign
his
feeling
obviously
was
that
the
superintendent
of
police
was
a
martinet
unfit
to
take
large
views
of
life
it
was
while
with
bill
jones
that
i
first
made
acquaintance
with
seth
bullock
seth
was
at
that
time
sheriff
in
the
black
hills
district
and
a
man
he
had
wanted
a
horse
thief
i
finally
got
i
being
at
the
time
deputy
sheriff
two
or
three
hundred
miles
to
the
north
the
man
went
by
a
nickname
which
i
will
call
crazy
steve
a
year
or
two
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
asking
about
him
from
his
uncle
a
thoroughly
respectable
man
in
a
western
state
and
later
this
uncle
and
i
met
at
washington
when
i
was
president
and
he
a
united
states
senator
it
was
some
time
after
steve
capture
that
i
went
down
to
deadwood
on
business
sylvane
ferris
and
i
on
horseback
while
bill
jones
drove
the
wagon
at
a
little
town
spearfish
i
think
after
crossing
the
last
eighty
or
ninety
miles
of
gumbo
prairies
we
met
seth
bullock
we
had
had
rather
a
rough
trip
and
had
lain
out
for
a
fortnight
so
i
suppose
we
looked
somewhat
unkempt
seth
received
us
with
rather
distant
courtesy
at
first
but
unbent
when
he
found
out
who
we
were
remarking
you
see
by
your
looks
i
thought
you
were
some
kind
of
a
gambling
outfit
and
that
i
might
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
he
then
inquired
after
the
capture
of
steve
with
a
little
of
the
air
of
one
sportsman
when
another
has
shot
a
quail
that
either
might
have
claimed
my
bird
i
believe
later
seth
bullock
became
and
has
ever
since
remained
one
of
my
stanchest
and
most
valued
friends
he
served
as
marshal
for
south
dakota
under
me
as
president
when
after
the
close
of
my
term
i
went
to
africa
on
getting
back
to
europe
i
cabled
seth
bullock
to
bring
over
bullock
and
meet
me
in
london
which
he
did
by
that
time
i
felt
that
i
just
had
to
meet
my
own
people
who
spoke
my
neighborhood
dialect
when
serving
as
deputy
sheriff
i
was
impressed
with
the
advantage
the
officer
of
the
law
has
over
ordinary
provided
he
thoroughly
knows
his
own
mind
there
are
exceptional
outlaws
men
with
a
price
on
their
heads
and
of
remarkable
prowess
who
are
utterly
indifferent
to
taking
life
and
whose
warfare
against
society
is
as
open
as
that
of
a
savage
on
the
the
law
officer
has
no
advantage
whatever
over
these
men
save
what
his
own
prowess
may
or
may
not
give
him
such
a
man
was
billy
the
kid
the
notorious
and
desperado
of
new
mexico
who
was
himself
finally
slain
by
a
friend
of
mine
pat
garrett
whom
when
i
was
president
i
made
collector
of
customs
at
el
paso
but
the
ordinary
criminal
even
when
murderously
inclined
feels
just
a
moment
hesitation
as
to
whether
he
cares
to
kill
an
officer
of
the
law
engaged
in
his
duty
i
took
in
more
than
one
man
who
was
probably
a
better
man
than
i
was
with
both
rifle
and
revolver
but
in
each
case
i
knew
just
what
i
wanted
to
do
and
like
david
harum
i
did
it
first
whereas
the
fraction
of
a
second
that
the
other
man
hesitated
put
him
in
a
position
where
it
was
useless
for
him
to
resist
i
owe
more
than
i
can
ever
express
to
the
west
which
of
course
means
to
the
men
and
women
i
met
in
the
west
there
were
a
few
people
of
bad
type
in
my
neighborhood
that
would
be
true
of
every
group
of
men
even
in
a
theological
seminary
but
i
could
not
speak
with
too
great
affection
and
respect
of
the
great
majority
of
my
friends
the
men
and
women
who
dwelt
for
a
space
of
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
along
the
little
missouri
i
was
always
as
welcome
at
their
houses
as
they
were
at
mine
everybody
worked
everybody
was
willing
to
help
everybody
else
and
yet
nobody
asked
any
favors
the
same
thing
was
true
of
the
people
whom
i
got
to
know
fifty
miles
east
and
fifty
miles
west
of
my
own
range
and
of
the
men
i
met
on
the
they
soon
accepted
me
as
a
friend
and
who
stood
on
an
equal
footing
with
them
and
i
believe
the
most
of
them
have
kept
their
feeling
for
me
ever
since
no
guests
were
ever
more
welcome
at
the
white
house
than
these
old
friends
of
the
cattle
ranches
and
the
cow
camps
the
men
with
whom
i
had
ridden
the
long
circle
and
eaten
at
the
of
a
whenever
they
turned
up
at
washington
during
my
presidency
i
remember
one
of
them
who
appeared
at
washington
one
day
just
before
lunch
a
huge
powerful
man
who
when
i
knew
him
had
been
distinctly
a
fighting
character
it
happened
that
on
that
day
another
old
friend
the
british
ambassador
bryce
was
among
those
coming
to
lunch
just
before
we
went
in
i
turned
to
my
friend
and
said
to
him
with
great
solemnity
remember
jim
that
if
you
shot
at
the
feet
of
the
british
ambassador
to
make
him
dance
it
would
be
likely
to
cause
international
complications
to
which
jim
responded
with
unaffected
horror
why
colonel
i
should
think
of
it
i
should
think
of
it
not
only
did
the
men
and
women
whom
i
met
in
the
cow
country
quite
unconsciously
help
me
by
the
insight
which
working
and
living
with
them
enabled
me
to
get
into
the
mind
and
soul
of
the
average
american
of
the
right
type
but
they
helped
me
in
another
way
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
men
were
of
just
the
kind
whom
it
would
be
well
to
have
with
me
if
ever
it
became
necessary
to
go
to
war
when
the
spanish
war
came
i
gave
this
thought
practical
realization
fortunately
wister
and
remington
with
pen
and
pencil
have
made
these
men
live
as
long
as
our
literature
lives
i
have
sometimes
been
asked
if
wister
virginian
is
not
overdrawn
why
one
of
the
men
i
have
mentioned
in
this
chapter
was
in
all
essentials
the
virginian
in
real
life
not
only
in
his
force
but
in
his
charm
half
of
the
men
i
worked
with
or
played
with
and
half
of
the
men
who
soldiered
with
me
afterwards
in
my
regiment
might
have
walked
out
of
wister
stories
or
pictures
there
were
bad
characters
in
the
western
country
at
that
time
of
course
and
under
the
conditions
of
life
they
were
probably
more
dangerous
than
they
would
have
been
elsewhere
i
hardly
ever
had
any
difficulty
however
i
never
went
into
a
saloon
and
in
the
little
hotels
i
kept
out
of
the
unless
as
sometimes
happened
the
was
the
only
room
on
the
lower
floor
except
the
i
always
endeavored
to
keep
out
of
a
quarrel
until
forbade
my
making
any
further
effort
to
avoid
it
and
i
very
rarely
had
even
the
semblance
of
trouble
of
course
amusing
incidents
occurred
now
and
then
usually
these
took
place
when
i
was
hunting
lost
horses
for
in
hunting
lost
horses
i
was
ordinarily
alone
and
occasionally
had
to
travel
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
from
my
own
country
on
one
such
occasion
i
reached
a
little
cow
town
long
after
dark
stabled
my
horse
in
an
empty
outbuilding
and
when
i
reached
the
hotel
was
informed
in
response
to
my
request
for
a
bed
that
i
could
have
the
last
one
left
as
there
was
only
one
other
man
in
it
the
room
to
which
i
was
shown
contained
two
double
beds
one
contained
two
men
fast
asleep
and
the
other
only
one
man
also
asleep
this
man
proved
to
be
a
friend
one
of
the
bill
joneses
whom
i
have
previously
mentioned
i
undressed
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
day
and
place
that
is
i
put
my
trousers
boots
shaps
and
gun
down
beside
the
bed
and
turned
in
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
was
awakened
by
the
door
being
thrown
open
and
a
lantern
flashed
in
my
face
the
light
gleaming
on
the
muzzle
of
a
cocked
another
man
said
to
the
it
ai
him
the
next
moment
my
bedfellow
was
covered
with
two
guns
and
addressed
now
bill
do
make
a
fuss
but
come
along
quiet
i
not
thinking
of
making
a
fuss
said
bill
that
right
was
the
answer
we
your
friends
we
do
want
to
hurt
you
we
just
want
you
to
come
along
you
know
why
and
bill
pulled
on
his
trousers
and
boots
and
walked
out
with
them
up
to
this
time
there
had
not
been
a
sound
from
the
other
bed
now
a
match
was
scratched
a
candle
lit
and
one
of
the
men
in
the
other
bed
looked
round
the
room
at
this
point
i
committed
the
breach
of
etiquette
of
asking
questions
i
wonder
why
they
took
bill
i
said
there
was
no
answer
and
i
repeated
i
wonder
why
they
took
bill
well
said
the
man
with
the
candle
dryly
i
reckon
they
wanted
him
and
with
that
he
blew
out
the
candle
and
conversation
ceased
later
i
discovered
that
bill
in
a
fit
of
playfulness
had
held
up
the
northern
pacific
train
at
a
station
by
shooting
at
the
feet
of
the
conductor
to
make
him
dance
this
was
purely
a
joke
on
bill
part
but
the
northern
pacific
people
possessed
a
less
robust
sense
of
humor
and
on
their
complaint
the
united
states
marshal
was
sent
after
bill
on
the
ground
that
by
delaying
the
train
he
had
interfered
with
the
mails
the
only
time
i
ever
had
serious
trouble
was
at
an
even
more
primitive
little
hotel
than
the
one
in
question
it
was
also
on
an
occasion
when
i
was
out
after
lost
horses
below
the
hotel
had
merely
a
a
and
a
kitchen
above
was
a
loft
with
fifteen
or
twenty
beds
in
it
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
i
reached
the
place
i
heard
one
or
two
shots
in
the
as
i
came
up
and
i
disliked
going
in
but
there
was
nowhere
else
to
go
and
it
was
a
cold
night
inside
the
room
were
several
men
who
including
the
bartender
were
wearing
the
kind
of
smile
worn
by
men
who
are
making
believe
to
like
what
they
do
like
a
shabby
individual
in
a
broad
hat
with
a
cocked
gun
in
each
hand
was
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
talking
with
strident
profanity
he
had
evidently
been
shooting
at
the
clock
which
had
two
or
three
holes
in
its
face
he
was
not
a
bad
man
of
the
really
dangerous
type
the
true
type
but
he
was
an
objectionable
creature
a
bad
man
a
bully
who
for
the
moment
was
having
things
all
his
own
way
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
hailed
me
as
four
eyes
in
reference
to
my
spectacles
and
said
four
eyes
is
going
to
treat
i
joined
in
the
laugh
and
got
behind
the
stove
and
sat
down
thinking
to
escape
notice
he
followed
me
however
and
though
i
tried
to
pass
it
off
as
a
jest
this
merely
made
him
more
offensive
and
he
stood
leaning
over
me
a
gun
in
each
hand
using
very
foul
language
he
was
foolish
to
stand
so
near
and
moreover
his
heels
were
close
together
so
that
his
position
was
unstable
accordingly
in
response
to
his
reiterated
command
that
i
should
set
up
the
drinks
i
said
well
if
i
got
to
i
got
to
and
rose
looking
past
him
as
i
rose
i
struck
quick
and
hard
with
my
right
just
to
one
side
of
the
point
of
his
jaw
hitting
with
my
left
as
i
straightened
out
and
then
again
with
my
right
he
fired
the
guns
but
i
do
not
know
whether
this
was
merely
a
convulsive
action
of
his
hands
or
whether
he
was
trying
to
shoot
at
me
when
he
went
down
he
struck
the
corner
of
the
bar
with
his
head
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
one
could
afford
to
take
chances
and
if
he
had
moved
i
was
about
to
drop
on
his
ribs
with
my
knees
but
he
was
senseless
i
took
away
his
guns
and
the
other
people
in
the
room
who
were
now
loud
in
their
denunciation
of
him
hustled
him
out
and
put
him
in
a
shed
i
got
dinner
as
soon
as
possible
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
away
from
the
windows
and
then
went
upstairs
to
bed
where
it
was
dark
so
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
any
one
shooting
at
me
from
the
outside
however
nothing
happened
when
my
assailant
came
to
he
went
down
to
the
station
and
left
on
a
freight
as
i
have
said
most
of
the
men
of
my
regiment
were
just
such
men
as
those
i
knew
in
the
ranch
country
indeed
some
of
my
ranch
friends
were
in
the
regiment
fred
herrig
the
forest
ranger
for
instance
in
whose
company
i
shot
my
biggest
mountain
ram
after
the
regiment
was
disbanded
the
careers
of
certain
of
the
men
were
diversified
by
odd
incidents
our
relations
were
of
the
friendliest
and
as
they
explained
they
felt
as
if
i
was
a
father
to
them
the
manifestations
of
this
feeling
were
sometimes
less
attractive
than
the
phrase
sounded
as
it
was
chiefly
used
by
the
few
who
were
behaving
like
very
bad
children
indeed
the
great
majority
of
the
men
when
the
regiment
disbanded
took
up
the
business
of
their
lives
where
they
had
dropped
it
a
few
months
previously
and
these
men
merely
tried
to
help
me
or
help
one
another
as
the
occasion
arose
no
man
ever
had
more
cause
to
be
proud
of
his
regiment
than
i
had
of
mine
both
in
war
and
in
peace
but
there
was
a
minority
among
them
who
in
certain
ways
were
unsuited
for
a
life
of
peaceful
regularity
although
often
enough
they
had
been
soldiers
it
was
from
these
men
that
letters
came
with
a
stereotyped
opening
which
always
caused
my
heart
to
sink
dear
colonel
i
write
you
because
i
am
in
trouble
the
trouble
might
take
almost
any
form
one
correspondent
continued
i
did
not
take
the
horse
but
they
say
i
did
another
complained
that
his
had
put
him
in
jail
for
bigamy
in
the
case
of
another
the
incident
was
more
markworthy
i
will
call
him
gritto
he
wrote
me
a
letter
beginning
dear
colonel
i
write
you
because
i
am
in
trouble
i
have
shot
a
lady
in
the
eye
but
colonel
i
was
not
shooting
at
the
lady
i
was
shooting
at
my
wife
which
he
apparently
regarded
as
a
sufficient
excuse
as
between
men
of
the
world
i
answered
that
i
drew
the
line
at
shooting
at
ladies
and
did
not
hear
any
more
of
the
incident
for
several
years
then
while
i
was
president
a
member
of
the
regiment
major
llewellyn
who
was
federal
district
attorney
under
me
in
new
mexico
wrote
me
a
letter
filled
as
his
letters
usually
were
with
bits
of
interesting
gossip
about
the
comrades
it
ran
in
part
as
follows
since
i
last
wrote
you
comrade
ritchie
has
killed
a
man
in
colorado
i
understand
that
the
comrade
was
playing
a
poker
game
and
the
man
sat
into
the
game
and
used
such
language
that
comrade
ritchie
had
to
shoot
comrade
webb
has
killed
two
men
in
beaver
arizona
comrade
webb
is
in
the
forest
service
and
the
killing
was
in
the
line
of
professional
duty
i
was
out
at
the
penitentiary
the
other
day
and
saw
comrade
gritto
who
you
may
remember
was
put
there
for
shooting
his
this
was
the
first
information
i
had
had
as
to
the
identity
of
the
lady
who
was
shot
in
the
eye
since
he
was
in
there
comrade
boyne
has
run
off
to
old
mexico
with
his
gritto
wife
and
the
people
of
grant
county
think
he
ought
to
be
let
out
evidently
the
sporting
instincts
of
the
people
of
grant
county
had
been
roused
and
they
felt
that
as
comrade
boyne
had
had
a
fair
start
the
other
comrade
should
be
let
out
in
order
to
see
what
would
happen
the
men
of
the
regiment
always
enthusiastically
helped
me
when
i
was
running
for
office
on
one
occasion
buck
taylor
of
texas
accompanied
me
on
a
trip
and
made
a
speech
for
me
the
crowd
took
to
his
speech
from
the
beginning
and
so
did
i
until
the
peroration
which
ran
as
follows
my
vote
for
my
colonel
vote
for
my
colonel
he
will
lead
you
as
he
led
us
like
sheep
to
the
this
hardly
seemed
a
tribute
to
my
military
skill
but
it
delighted
the
crowd
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
did
me
nothing
but
good
on
another
tour
when
i
was
running
for
a
member
of
the
regiment
who
was
along
on
the
train
got
into
a
discussion
with
a
populist
editor
who
had
expressed
an
unfavorable
estimate
of
my
character
and
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
shot
the
editor
not
fatally
we
had
to
leave
him
to
be
tried
and
as
he
had
no
money
i
left
him
to
hire
counsel
having
borrowed
the
money
from
senator
wolcott
of
colorado
who
was
also
with
me
after
election
i
received
from
my
friend
a
letter
running
dear
colonel
i
find
i
will
not
have
to
use
that
you
lent
me
as
we
have
elected
our
candidate
for
district
attorney
so
i
have
used
it
to
settle
a
horse
transaction
in
which
i
unfortunately
became
involved
a
few
weeks
later
however
i
received
a
heartbroken
letter
setting
forth
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
whom
he
evidently
felt
to
be
a
formalist
had
put
him
in
jail
then
the
affair
dropped
out
of
sight
until
two
or
three
years
later
when
as
president
i
visited
a
town
in
another
state
and
the
leaders
of
the
delegation
which
received
me
included
both
my
correspondent
and
the
editor
now
fast
friends
and
both
of
them
ardent
supporters
of
mine
at
one
of
the
regimental
reunions
a
man
who
had
been
an
excellent
soldier
in
greeting
me
mentioned
how
glad
he
was
that
the
judge
had
let
him
out
in
time
to
get
to
the
reunion
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
he
replied
with
some
surprise
why
colonel
do
you
know
i
had
a
difficulty
with
a
gentleman
and
er
well
i
killed
the
gentleman
but
you
can
see
that
the
judge
thought
it
was
all
right
or
he
would
have
let
me
go
waiving
the
latter
point
i
said
how
did
it
happen
how
did
you
do
it
misinterpreting
my
question
as
showing
an
interest
only
in
the
technique
of
the
performance
the
replied
with
a
on
a
frame
colonel
i
chuckled
over
the
answer
and
it
became
proverbial
with
my
family
and
some
of
my
friends
including
seth
bullock
when
i
was
shot
at
milwaukee
seth
bullock
wired
an
inquiry
to
which
i
responded
that
it
was
all
right
that
the
weapon
was
merely
a
on
a
frame
the
telegram
in
some
way
became
public
and
puzzled
outsiders
by
the
way
both
the
men
of
my
regiment
and
the
friends
i
had
made
in
the
old
days
in
the
west
were
themselves
a
little
puzzled
at
the
interest
shown
in
my
making
my
speech
after
being
shot
this
was
what
they
expected
what
they
accepted
as
the
right
thing
for
a
man
to
do
under
the
circumstances
a
thing
the
of
which
would
have
been
discreditable
rather
than
the
performance
being
creditable
they
would
not
have
expected
a
man
to
leave
a
battle
for
instance
because
of
being
wounded
in
such
fashion
and
they
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
abandon
a
less
important
and
less
risky
duty
one
of
the
best
soldiers
of
my
regiment
was
a
huge
man
whom
i
made
marshal
of
a
rocky
mountain
state
he
had
spent
his
hot
and
lusty
youth
on
the
frontier
during
its
viking
age
and
at
that
time
had
naturally
taken
part
in
incidents
which
seemed
queer
to
men
accustomed
to
die
decently
of
zymotic
diseases
i
told
him
that
an
effort
would
doubtless
be
made
to
prevent
his
confirmation
by
the
senate
and
therefore
that
i
wanted
to
know
all
the
facts
in
his
case
had
he
played
faro
he
had
but
it
was
when
everybody
played
faro
and
he
had
never
played
a
brace
game
had
he
killed
anybody
yes
but
it
was
in
dodge
city
on
occasions
when
he
was
deputy
marshal
or
town
marshal
at
a
time
when
dodge
city
now
the
most
peaceful
of
communities
was
the
toughest
town
on
the
continent
and
crowded
with
outlaws
and
road
agents
and
he
produced
telegrams
from
judges
of
high
character
testifying
to
the
need
of
the
actions
he
had
taken
finally
i
said
now
ben
how
did
you
lose
that
half
of
your
ear
to
which
looking
rather
shy
he
responded
well
colonel
it
was
bit
off
how
did
it
happen
ben
well
you
see
i
was
sent
to
arrest
a
gentleman
and
him
and
me
mixed
it
up
and
he
bit
off
my
ear
what
did
you
do
to
the
gentleman
ben
and
ben
looking
more
coy
than
ever
responded
well
colonel
we
broke
about
even
i
forebore
to
inquire
what
variety
of
mayhem
he
had
committed
on
the
gentleman
after
considerable
struggle
i
got
him
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
he
made
one
of
the
best
marshals
in
the
entire
service
exactly
as
he
had
already
made
one
of
the
best
soldiers
in
the
regiment
and
i
never
wish
to
see
a
better
citizen
nor
a
man
in
whom
i
would
more
implicitly
trust
in
every
way
when
in
i
was
nominated
for
i
was
sent
by
the
national
committee
on
a
trip
into
the
states
of
the
high
plains
and
the
rocky
mountains
these
had
all
gone
overwhelmingly
for
bryan
on
the
issue
four
years
previously
and
it
was
thought
that
i
because
of
my
knowledge
of
and
acquaintanceship
with
the
people
might
accomplish
something
towards
bringing
them
back
into
line
it
was
an
interesting
trip
and
the
monotony
usually
attendant
upon
such
a
campaign
of
political
speaking
was
diversified
in
vivid
fashion
by
occasional
hostile
audiences
one
or
two
of
the
meetings
ended
in
riots
one
meeting
was
finally
broken
up
by
a
mob
everybody
fought
so
that
the
speaking
had
to
stop
soon
after
this
we
reached
another
town
where
we
were
told
there
might
be
trouble
here
the
local
committee
included
an
old
and
valued
friend
a
man
of
repute
who
was
not
in
the
least
quarrelsome
but
who
always
kept
his
word
we
marched
round
to
the
local
which
was
packed
with
a
mass
of
men
many
of
them
rather
my
friend
the
man
sat
immediately
behind
me
a
gun
on
each
hip
his
arms
folded
looking
at
the
audience
fixing
his
gaze
with
instant
intentness
on
any
section
of
the
house
from
which
there
came
so
much
as
a
whisper
the
audience
listened
to
me
with
rapt
attention
at
the
end
with
a
pride
in
my
rhetorical
powers
which
proceeded
from
a
misunderstanding
of
the
situation
i
remarked
to
the
chairman
i
held
that
audience
well
there
was
an
interruption
to
which
the
chairman
replied
interruption
well
i
guess
not
seth
had
sent
round
word
that
if
any
son
of
a
gun
peeped
he
kill
him
there
was
one
bit
of
frontier
philosophy
which
i
should
like
to
see
imitated
in
more
advanced
communities
certain
crimes
of
revolting
baseness
and
cruelty
were
never
forgiven
but
in
the
case
of
ordinary
offenses
the
man
who
had
served
his
term
and
who
then
tried
to
make
good
was
given
a
fair
chance
and
of
course
this
was
equally
true
of
the
women
every
one
who
has
studied
the
subject
at
all
is
only
too
well
aware
that
the
world
offsets
the
readiness
with
which
it
condones
a
crime
for
which
a
man
escapes
punishment
by
its
unforgiving
relentlessness
to
the
often
far
less
guilty
man
who
punished
and
who
therefore
has
made
his
atonement
on
the
frontier
if
the
man
honestly
tried
to
behave
himself
there
was
generally
a
disposition
to
give
him
fair
play
and
a
decent
show
several
of
the
men
i
knew
and
whom
i
particularly
liked
came
in
this
class
there
was
one
such
man
in
my
regiment
a
man
who
had
served
a
term
for
robbery
under
arms
and
who
had
atoned
for
it
by
many
years
of
fine
performance
of
duty
i
put
him
in
a
high
official
position
and
no
man
under
me
rendered
better
service
to
the
state
nor
was
there
any
man
whom
as
soldier
as
civil
officer
as
citizen
and
as
friend
i
valued
and
respected
and
now
value
and
respect
more
now
i
suppose
some
good
people
will
gather
from
this
that
i
favor
men
who
commit
crimes
i
certainly
do
not
favor
them
i
have
not
a
particle
of
sympathy
with
the
sentimentality
as
i
deem
it
the
mawkishness
which
overflows
with
foolish
pity
for
the
criminal
and
cares
not
at
all
for
the
victim
of
the
criminal
i
am
glad
to
see
punished
the
punishment
is
an
absolute
necessity
from
the
standpoint
of
society
and
i
put
the
reformation
of
the
criminal
second
to
the
welfare
of
society
but
i
do
desire
to
see
the
man
or
woman
who
has
paid
the
penalty
and
who
wishes
to
reform
given
a
helping
hand
surely
every
one
of
us
who
knows
his
own
heart
must
know
that
he
too
may
stumble
and
should
be
anxious
to
help
his
brother
or
sister
who
has
stumbled
when
the
criminal
has
been
punished
if
he
then
shows
a
sincere
desire
to
lead
a
decent
and
upright
life
he
should
be
given
the
chance
he
should
be
helped
and
not
hindered
and
if
he
makes
good
he
should
receive
that
respect
from
others
which
so
often
aids
in
creating
the
most
invaluable
of
all
possessions
chapter
v
applied
idealism
in
the
spring
of
i
was
appointed
by
president
harrison
civil
service
commissioner
for
nearly
five
years
i
had
not
been
very
active
in
political
life
although
i
had
done
some
routine
work
in
the
organization
and
had
made
campaign
speeches
and
in
had
run
for
mayor
of
new
york
against
abram
hewitt
democrat
and
henry
george
independent
and
had
been
defeated
i
served
six
years
as
civil
service
commissioner
four
years
under
president
harrison
and
then
two
years
under
president
cleveland
i
was
treated
by
both
presidents
with
the
utmost
consideration
among
my
there
was
at
one
time
hugh
thompson
of
south
carolina
and
at
another
time
john
proctor
of
kentucky
they
were
democrats
and
soldiers
i
became
deeply
attached
to
both
and
we
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
every
contest
in
which
the
commission
was
forced
to
take
part
civil
service
reform
had
two
sides
there
was
first
the
effort
to
secure
a
more
efficient
administration
of
the
public
service
and
second
the
even
more
important
effort
to
withdraw
the
administrative
offices
of
the
government
from
the
domain
of
spoils
politics
and
thereby
cut
out
of
american
political
life
a
fruitful
source
of
corruption
and
degradation
the
spoils
theory
of
politics
is
that
public
office
is
so
much
plunder
which
the
victorious
political
party
is
entitled
to
appropriate
to
the
use
of
its
adherents
under
this
system
the
work
of
the
government
was
often
done
well
even
in
those
days
when
civil
service
reform
was
only
an
experiment
because
the
man
running
an
office
if
himself
an
able
and
man
knew
that
inefficiency
in
administration
would
be
visited
on
his
head
in
the
long
run
and
therefore
insisted
upon
most
of
his
subordinates
doing
good
work
and
moreover
the
men
appointed
under
the
spoils
system
were
necessarily
men
of
a
certain
initiative
and
power
because
those
who
lacked
these
qualities
were
not
able
to
shoulder
themselves
to
the
front
yet
there
were
many
flagrant
instances
of
inefficiency
where
a
powerful
chief
quartered
friend
adherent
or
kinsman
upon
the
government
moreover
the
necessarily
haphazard
nature
of
the
employment
the
need
of
obtaining
and
holding
the
office
by
service
wholly
unconnected
with
official
duty
inevitably
tended
to
lower
the
standard
of
public
morality
alike
among
the
and
among
the
politicians
who
rendered
party
service
with
the
hope
of
reward
in
office
indeed
the
doctrine
that
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
the
cynical
of
the
spoils
politician
in
america
for
the
sixty
years
preceding
my
own
entrance
into
public
life
is
so
nakedly
vicious
that
few
men
of
trained
mind
defend
it
to
appoint
promote
reduce
and
expel
from
the
public
service
stenographers
women
typewriters
clerks
because
of
the
politics
of
themselves
or
their
friends
without
regard
to
their
own
service
is
from
the
standpoint
of
the
people
at
large
as
foolish
and
degrading
as
it
is
wicked
such
being
the
case
it
would
seem
at
first
sight
extraordinary
that
it
should
be
so
difficult
to
uproot
the
system
unfortunately
it
was
permitted
to
become
habitual
and
traditional
in
american
life
so
that
the
conception
of
public
office
as
something
to
be
used
primarily
for
the
good
of
the
dominant
political
party
became
ingrained
in
the
mind
of
the
average
american
and
he
grew
so
accustomed
to
the
whole
process
that
it
seemed
part
of
the
order
of
nature
not
merely
the
politicians
but
the
bulk
of
the
people
accepted
this
in
a
way
as
the
only
proper
attitude
there
were
plenty
of
communities
where
the
citizens
themselves
did
not
think
it
natural
or
indeed
proper
that
the
should
be
held
by
a
man
belonging
to
the
defeated
party
moreover
unless
both
sides
were
forbidden
to
use
the
offices
for
purposes
of
political
reward
the
side
that
did
use
them
possessed
such
an
advantage
over
the
other
that
in
the
long
run
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
other
not
to
follow
the
bad
example
that
had
been
set
each
party
profited
by
the
offices
when
in
power
and
when
in
opposition
each
party
insincerely
denounced
its
opponents
for
doing
exactly
what
it
itself
had
done
and
intended
again
to
do
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
remedy
the
evil
both
gradually
to
change
the
average
citizen
mental
attitude
toward
the
question
and
also
to
secure
proper
laws
and
proper
administration
of
the
laws
the
work
is
far
from
finished
even
yet
there
are
still
masses
of
who
can
be
used
by
an
unscrupulous
administration
to
debauch
political
conventions
and
fraudulently
overcome
public
sentiment
especially
in
the
rotten
borough
districts
those
where
the
party
is
not
strong
and
where
the
in
consequence
have
a
disproportionate
influence
this
was
done
by
the
republican
administration
in
to
the
ruin
of
the
republican
party
moreover
there
are
numbers
of
states
and
municipalities
where
very
little
has
as
yet
been
done
to
do
away
with
the
spoils
system
but
in
the
national
government
scores
of
thousands
of
offices
have
been
put
under
the
merit
system
chiefly
through
the
action
of
the
national
civil
service
commission
the
use
of
government
offices
as
patronage
is
a
handicap
difficult
to
overestimate
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
strive
to
get
good
government
any
effort
for
reform
of
any
sort
national
state
or
municipal
results
in
the
reformers
immediately
finding
themselves
face
to
face
with
an
organized
band
of
drilled
mercenaries
who
are
paid
out
of
the
public
chest
to
train
themselves
with
such
skill
that
ordinary
good
citizens
when
they
meet
them
at
the
polls
are
in
much
the
position
of
militia
matched
against
regular
troops
yet
these
citizens
themselves
support
and
pay
their
opponents
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
drilled
to
overthrow
the
very
men
who
support
them
civil
service
reform
is
designed
primarily
to
give
the
average
american
citizen
a
fair
chance
in
politics
to
give
to
this
citizen
the
same
weight
in
politics
that
the
ward
heeler
has
patronage
does
not
really
help
a
party
it
helps
the
bosses
to
get
control
of
the
machinery
of
the
party
as
in
was
true
of
the
republican
party
but
it
does
not
help
the
party
on
the
average
the
most
sweeping
party
victories
in
our
history
have
been
won
when
the
patronage
was
against
the
victors
all
that
the
patronage
does
is
to
help
the
worst
element
in
the
party
retain
control
of
the
party
organization
two
of
the
evil
elements
in
our
government
against
which
good
citizens
have
to
contend
are
the
lack
of
continuous
activity
on
the
part
of
these
good
citizens
themselves
and
the
activity
of
those
who
have
only
an
evil
in
political
life
it
is
difficult
to
interest
the
average
citizen
in
any
particular
movement
to
the
degree
of
getting
him
to
take
an
efficient
part
in
it
he
wishes
the
movement
well
but
he
will
not
or
often
can
not
take
the
time
and
the
trouble
to
serve
it
efficiently
and
this
whether
he
happens
to
be
a
mechanic
or
a
banker
a
telegraph
operator
or
a
storekeeper
he
has
his
own
interests
his
own
business
and
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
spare
the
time
to
go
around
to
the
primaries
to
see
to
the
organization
to
see
to
getting
out
the
vote
in
short
to
attend
to
all
the
thousand
details
of
political
management
on
the
other
hand
the
spoils
system
breeds
a
class
of
men
whose
financial
interest
it
is
to
take
this
necessary
time
and
trouble
they
are
paid
for
so
doing
and
they
are
paid
out
of
the
public
chest
under
the
spoils
system
a
man
is
appointed
to
an
ordinary
clerical
or
ministerial
position
in
the
municipal
federal
or
state
government
not
primarily
because
he
is
expected
to
be
a
good
servant
but
because
he
has
rendered
help
to
some
big
boss
or
to
the
henchman
of
some
big
boss
his
stay
in
office
depends
not
upon
how
he
performs
service
but
upon
how
he
retains
his
influence
in
the
party
this
necessarily
means
that
his
attention
to
the
interests
of
the
public
at
large
even
though
real
is
secondary
to
his
devotion
to
his
organization
or
to
the
interest
of
the
ward
leader
who
put
him
in
his
place
so
he
and
his
fellows
attend
to
politics
not
once
a
year
not
two
or
three
times
a
year
like
the
average
citizen
but
every
day
in
the
year
it
is
the
one
thing
that
they
talk
of
for
it
is
their
bread
and
butter
they
plan
about
it
and
they
scheme
about
it
they
do
it
because
it
is
their
business
i
do
not
blame
them
in
the
least
i
blame
us
the
people
for
we
ought
to
make
it
clear
as
a
bell
that
the
business
of
serving
the
people
in
one
of
the
ordinary
ministerial
government
positions
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
deciding
the
policy
of
the
government
should
have
no
necessary
connection
with
the
management
of
primaries
of
caucuses
and
of
nominating
conventions
as
a
result
of
our
wrong
thinking
and
supineness
we
american
citizens
tend
to
breed
a
mass
of
men
whose
interests
in
governmental
matters
are
often
adverse
to
ours
who
are
thoroughly
drilled
thoroughly
organized
who
make
their
livelihood
out
of
politics
and
who
frequently
make
their
livelihood
out
of
bad
politics
they
know
every
little
twist
and
turn
no
matter
how
intricate
in
the
politics
of
their
several
wards
and
when
election
day
comes
the
ordinary
citizen
who
has
merely
the
interest
that
all
good
men
all
decent
citizens
should
have
in
political
life
finds
himself
as
helpless
before
these
men
as
if
he
were
a
solitary
volunteer
in
the
presence
of
a
band
of
drilled
mercenaries
on
a
field
of
battle
there
are
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
federal
offices
not
to
speak
of
state
and
municipal
offices
the
men
who
fill
these
offices
and
the
men
who
wish
to
fill
them
within
and
without
the
dominant
party
for
the
time
being
make
a
regular
army
whose
interest
it
is
that
the
system
of
politics
shall
continue
against
their
concrete
interest
we
have
merely
the
generally
unorganized
sentiment
of
the
community
in
favor
of
putting
things
on
a
decent
basis
the
large
number
of
men
who
believe
vaguely
in
good
are
pitted
against
the
smaller
but
still
larger
number
of
men
whose
interest
it
often
becomes
to
act
very
concretely
and
actively
for
evil
and
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
struggle
is
doubtful
during
my
six
years
service
as
commissioner
the
field
of
the
merit
system
was
extended
at
the
expense
of
the
spoils
system
so
as
to
include
several
times
the
number
of
offices
that
had
originally
been
included
generally
this
was
done
by
the
introduction
of
competitive
entrance
examinations
sometimes
as
in
the
by
a
system
of
registration
this
of
itself
was
good
work
even
better
work
was
making
the
law
efficient
and
genuine
where
it
applied
as
was
inevitable
in
the
introduction
of
such
a
system
there
was
at
first
only
partial
success
in
its
application
for
instance
it
applied
to
the
ordinary
employees
in
the
big
and
but
not
to
the
heads
of
these
offices
a
number
of
the
heads
of
the
offices
were
slippery
politicians
of
a
low
moral
grade
themselves
appointed
under
the
spoils
system
and
anxious
directly
or
indirectly
to
break
down
the
merit
system
and
to
pay
their
own
political
debts
by
appointing
their
henchmen
and
supporters
to
the
positions
under
them
occasionally
these
men
acted
with
open
and
naked
brutality
ordinarily
they
sought
by
cunning
to
evade
the
law
the
civil
service
reformers
on
the
other
hand
were
in
most
cases
not
much
used
to
practical
politics
and
were
often
helpless
when
pitted
against
veteran
professional
politicians
in
consequence
i
found
at
the
beginning
of
my
experiences
that
there
were
many
offices
in
which
the
execution
of
the
law
was
a
sham
this
was
very
damaging
because
it
encouraged
the
politicians
to
assault
the
law
everywhere
and
on
the
other
hand
made
good
people
feel
that
the
law
was
not
worth
while
defending
the
first
effort
of
myself
and
my
colleagues
was
to
secure
the
genuine
enforcement
of
the
law
in
this
we
succeeded
after
a
number
of
lively
fights
but
of
course
in
these
fights
we
were
obliged
to
strike
a
large
number
of
influential
politicians
some
of
them
in
congress
some
of
them
the
supporters
and
backers
of
men
who
were
in
congress
accordingly
we
soon
found
ourselves
engaged
in
a
series
of
contests
with
prominent
senators
and
congressmen
there
were
a
number
of
senators
and
congressmen
men
like
congressman
afterwards
senator
lodge
of
massachusetts
senator
cushman
davis
of
minnesota
senator
orville
platt
of
connecticut
senator
cockrell
of
missouri
congressman
afterwards
president
mckinley
of
ohio
and
congressman
dargan
of
south
carolina
who
abhorred
the
business
of
the
spoilsman
who
efficiently
and
resolutely
championed
the
reform
at
every
turn
and
without
whom
the
whole
reform
would
certainly
have
failed
but
there
were
plenty
of
other
senators
and
congressmen
who
hated
the
whole
reform
and
everything
concerned
with
it
and
everybody
who
championed
it
and
sometimes
to
use
a
legal
phrase
their
hatred
was
for
cause
and
sometimes
it
was
peremptory
that
is
sometimes
the
commission
interfered
with
their
most
efficient
and
incidentally
most
corrupt
and
unscrupulous
supporters
and
at
other
times
where
there
was
no
such
interference
a
man
nevertheless
had
an
innate
dislike
of
anything
that
tended
to
decency
in
government
these
men
were
always
waging
war
against
us
and
they
usually
had
the
more
or
less
open
support
of
a
certain
number
of
government
officials
from
cabinet
officers
down
the
senators
and
congressmen
in
question
opposed
us
in
many
different
ways
sometimes
for
instance
they
had
committees
appointed
to
investigate
us
during
my
public
career
without
and
within
office
i
grew
accustomed
to
accept
appearances
before
investigating
committees
as
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
sometimes
they
tried
to
cut
off
the
appropriation
for
the
commission
occasionally
we
would
bring
to
terms
these
senators
or
congressmen
who
fought
the
commission
by
the
simple
expedient
of
not
holding
examinations
in
their
districts
this
always
brought
frantic
appeals
from
their
constituents
and
we
would
explain
that
unfortunately
the
appropriations
had
been
cut
so
that
we
could
not
hold
examinations
in
every
district
and
that
obviously
we
could
not
neglect
the
districts
of
those
congressmen
who
believed
in
the
reform
and
therefore
in
the
examinations
the
constituents
then
turned
their
attention
to
the
congressman
and
the
result
was
that
in
the
long
run
we
obtained
sufficient
money
to
enable
us
to
do
our
work
on
the
whole
the
most
prominent
leaders
favored
us
any
man
who
is
the
head
of
a
big
department
if
he
has
any
fitness
at
all
wishes
to
see
that
department
run
well
and
a
very
little
practical
experience
shows
him
that
it
can
not
be
run
well
if
he
must
make
his
appointments
to
please
spoilsmongering
politicians
as
with
almost
every
reform
that
i
have
ever
undertaken
most
of
the
opposition
took
the
guise
of
shrewd
slander
our
opponents
relied
chiefly
on
downright
misrepresentation
of
what
it
was
that
we
were
trying
to
accomplish
and
of
our
methods
acts
and
personalities
i
had
more
than
one
lively
encounter
with
the
authors
and
sponsors
of
these
misrepresentations
which
at
the
time
were
full
of
interest
to
me
but
it
would
be
a
dreary
thing
now
to
go
over
the
record
of
exploded
mendacity
or
to
expose
the
meanness
and
malice
shown
by
some
men
of
high
official
position
a
favorite
argument
was
to
call
the
reform
chinese
because
the
chinese
had
constructed
an
inefficient
governmental
system
based
in
part
on
the
theory
of
written
competitive
examinations
the
argument
was
simple
there
had
been
written
examinations
in
china
it
was
proposed
to
establish
written
examinations
in
the
united
states
therefore
the
proposed
system
was
chinese
the
argument
might
have
been
applied
still
further
for
instance
the
chinese
had
used
gunpowder
for
centuries
gunpowder
is
used
in
springfield
rifles
therefore
springfield
rifles
were
chinese
one
argument
is
quite
as
logical
as
the
other
it
was
impossible
to
answer
every
falsehood
about
the
system
but
it
was
possible
to
answer
certain
falsehoods
especially
when
uttered
by
some
senator
or
congressman
of
note
usually
these
false
statements
took
the
form
of
assertions
that
we
had
asked
preposterous
questions
of
applicants
at
times
they
also
included
the
assertion
that
we
credited
people
to
districts
where
they
did
not
live
this
simply
meaning
that
these
persons
were
not
known
to
the
active
ward
politicians
of
those
districts
one
opponent
with
whom
we
had
a
rather
lively
tilt
was
a
republican
congressman
from
ohio
grosvenor
one
of
the
floor
leaders
grosvenor
made
his
attack
in
the
house
and
enumerated
our
sins
in
picturesque
rather
than
accurate
fashion
there
was
a
congressional
committee
investigating
us
at
the
time
and
on
my
next
appearance
before
them
i
asked
that
grosvenor
be
requested
to
meet
me
before
the
committee
grosvenor
did
not
take
up
the
challenge
for
several
weeks
until
it
was
announced
that
i
was
leaving
for
my
ranch
in
dakota
whereupon
deeming
it
safe
he
wrote
me
a
letter
expressing
his
ardent
wish
that
i
should
appear
before
the
committee
to
meet
him
i
promptly
canceled
my
ticket
waited
and
met
him
he
proved
to
be
a
person
of
happily
treacherous
memory
so
that
the
simple
expedient
of
arranging
his
statements
in
pairs
was
sufficient
to
reduce
him
to
confusion
for
instance
he
had
been
trapped
into
making
the
unwary
remark
i
do
not
want
to
repeal
the
civil
service
law
and
i
never
said
so
i
produced
the
following
extract
from
one
of
his
speeches
i
will
vote
not
only
to
strike
out
this
provision
but
i
will
vote
to
repeal
the
whole
law
to
this
he
merely
replied
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
between
those
two
statements
he
asserted
that
rufus
putnam
fraudulently
credited
to
washington
county
ohio
never
lived
in
washington
county
ohio
or
in
my
congressional
district
or
in
ohio
as
far
as
i
know
we
produced
a
letter
which
thanks
to
a
beneficent
providence
he
had
himself
written
about
rufus
putnam
in
which
he
said
rufus
putnam
is
a
legal
resident
of
my
district
and
has
relatives
living
there
now
he
explained
first
that
he
had
not
written
the
letter
second
that
he
had
forgotten
he
had
written
the
letter
and
third
that
he
was
grossly
deceived
when
he
wrote
it
he
said
i
have
not
been
informed
of
one
applicant
who
has
found
a
place
in
the
classified
service
from
my
district
we
confronted
him
with
the
names
of
eight
he
looked
them
over
and
said
yes
the
eight
men
are
living
in
my
district
as
now
constituted
but
added
that
his
district
had
been
gerrymandered
so
that
he
could
no
longer
tell
who
did
and
who
did
live
in
it
when
i
started
further
to
question
him
he
accused
me
of
a
lack
of
humor
in
not
appreciating
that
his
statements
were
made
in
a
jesting
way
and
then
announced
that
a
congressman
making
a
speech
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
was
perhaps
in
a
little
different
position
from
a
witness
on
the
witness
stand
a
frank
admission
that
he
did
not
consider
exactitude
of
statement
necessary
when
he
was
speaking
as
a
congressman
finally
he
rose
with
great
dignity
and
said
that
it
was
his
constitutional
right
not
to
be
questioned
elsewhere
as
to
what
he
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
accordingly
he
left
the
delighted
committee
to
pursue
its
investigations
without
further
aid
from
him
a
more
important
opponent
was
the
then
democratic
leader
of
the
senate
gorman
in
a
speech
attacking
the
commission
gorman
described
with
moving
pathos
how
a
friend
of
his
a
bright
young
man
from
baltimore
a
scholar
well
recommended
by
his
pastor
wished
to
be
a
and
how
he
went
before
us
to
be
examined
the
first
question
we
asked
him
said
gorman
was
the
shortest
route
from
baltimore
to
china
to
which
the
bright
young
man
responded
that
he
did
want
to
go
to
china
and
had
never
studied
up
that
route
thereupon
said
gorman
we
asked
him
all
about
the
steamship
lines
from
the
united
states
to
europe
then
branched
him
off
into
geology
tried
him
in
chemistry
and
finally
turned
him
down
apparently
gorman
did
not
know
that
we
kept
full
records
of
our
examinations
i
at
once
wrote
to
him
stating
that
i
had
carefully
looked
through
all
our
examination
papers
and
had
not
been
able
to
find
one
question
even
remotely
resembling
any
of
these
questions
which
he
alleged
had
been
asked
and
that
i
would
be
greatly
obliged
if
he
would
give
me
the
name
of
the
bright
young
man
who
had
deceived
him
however
that
bright
young
man
remained
permanently
without
a
name
i
also
asked
gorman
if
he
did
not
wish
to
give
us
the
name
of
his
informant
to
give
us
the
date
of
the
examination
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
taken
part
and
i
offered
if
he
would
send
down
a
representative
to
look
through
our
files
to
give
him
all
the
aid
we
could
in
his
effort
to
discover
any
such
questions
but
gorman
not
hitherto
known
as
a
sensitive
soul
expressed
himself
as
so
shocked
at
the
thought
that
the
veracity
of
the
bright
young
man
should
be
doubted
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
answer
my
letter
so
i
made
a
public
statement
to
the
effect
that
no
such
questions
had
ever
been
asked
gorman
brooded
over
this
and
during
the
next
session
of
congress
he
rose
and
complained
that
he
had
received
a
very
impudent
letter
from
me
my
letter
was
a
respectful
note
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
he
wished
he
could
by
personal
examination
satisfy
himself
that
his
statements
had
no
foundation
in
fact
he
further
stated
that
he
had
been
cruelly
called
to
account
by
me
because
he
had
been
endeavoring
to
right
a
great
wrong
that
the
civil
service
commission
had
committed
but
he
never
then
or
afterwards
furnished
any
clue
to
the
identity
of
that
child
of
his
fondest
fancy
the
bright
young
man
without
a
name
this
is
a
condensation
of
a
speech
i
at
the
time
made
to
the
louis
civil
service
reform
association
senator
gorman
was
then
the
senate
leader
of
the
party
that
had
just
been
victorious
in
the
congressional
elections
the
incident
is
of
note
chiefly
as
shedding
light
on
the
mental
of
the
man
who
at
the
time
was
one
of
the
two
or
three
most
influential
leaders
of
the
democratic
party
gorman
had
been
party
manager
in
the
presidential
campaign
and
was
the
democratic
leader
in
congress
it
seemed
extraordinary
that
he
should
be
so
reckless
as
to
make
statements
with
no
foundation
in
fact
which
he
might
have
known
that
i
would
not
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
then
as
now
the
ordinary
newspaper
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
was
quite
as
reckless
in
its
misstatements
of
fact
about
public
men
and
measures
but
for
a
man
in
gorman
position
of
responsible
leadership
such
action
seemed
hardly
worth
while
however
it
is
at
least
to
be
said
for
gorman
that
he
was
not
trying
by
falsehood
to
take
away
any
character
it
would
be
well
for
writers
and
speakers
to
bear
in
mind
the
remark
of
wilson
to
the
effect
that
while
there
are
nine
hundred
and
kinds
of
falsehood
the
only
kind
specifically
condemned
in
scripture
just
as
murder
theft
and
adultery
are
condemned
is
bearing
false
witness
against
one
neighbor
one
of
the
worst
features
of
the
old
spoils
system
was
the
ruthless
cruelty
and
brutality
it
so
often
bred
in
the
treatment
of
faithful
public
servants
without
political
influence
life
is
hard
enough
and
cruel
enough
at
best
and
this
is
as
true
of
public
service
as
of
private
service
under
no
system
will
it
be
possible
to
do
away
with
all
favoritism
and
brutality
and
meanness
and
malice
but
at
least
we
can
try
to
minimize
the
exhibition
of
these
qualities
i
once
came
across
a
case
in
washington
which
very
keenly
excited
my
sympathy
under
an
administration
prior
to
the
one
with
which
i
was
connected
a
lady
had
been
ousted
from
a
government
position
she
came
to
me
to
see
if
she
could
be
reinstated
this
was
not
possible
but
by
active
work
i
did
get
her
put
back
in
a
somewhat
lower
position
and
this
only
by
an
appeal
to
the
sympathy
of
a
certain
official
she
was
so
pallid
and
so
careworn
that
she
excited
my
sympathy
and
i
made
inquiries
about
her
she
was
a
poor
woman
with
two
children
a
widow
she
and
her
two
children
were
in
actual
want
she
could
barely
keep
the
two
children
decently
clad
and
she
could
not
give
them
the
food
growing
children
need
three
years
before
she
had
been
employed
in
a
bureau
in
a
department
of
washington
doing
her
work
faithfully
at
a
salary
of
about
it
was
enough
to
keep
her
and
her
two
children
in
clothing
food
and
shelter
one
day
the
chief
of
the
bureau
called
her
up
and
told
her
he
was
very
sorry
that
he
had
to
dismiss
her
in
great
distress
she
asked
him
why
she
thought
that
she
had
been
doing
her
work
satisfactorily
he
answered
her
that
she
had
been
doing
well
and
that
he
wished
very
much
that
he
could
keep
her
that
he
would
do
so
if
he
possibly
could
but
that
he
could
not
for
a
certain
senator
giving
his
name
a
very
influential
member
of
the
senate
had
demanded
her
place
for
a
friend
of
his
who
had
influence
the
woman
told
the
bureau
chief
that
it
meant
turning
her
out
to
starve
she
had
been
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
in
the
public
service
she
had
lost
all
touch
with
her
friends
in
her
native
state
dismissal
meant
absolute
want
for
her
and
her
children
on
this
the
chief
who
was
a
kind
man
said
he
would
not
have
her
turned
out
and
sent
her
back
to
her
work
but
three
weeks
afterwards
he
called
her
up
again
and
told
her
he
could
not
say
how
sorry
he
was
but
the
thing
had
to
be
done
the
senator
had
been
around
in
person
to
know
why
the
change
had
not
been
made
and
had
told
the
chief
that
he
would
be
himself
removed
if
the
place
were
not
given
him
the
senator
was
an
extremely
influential
man
his
wants
had
to
be
attended
to
and
the
woman
had
to
go
and
go
she
did
and
turned
out
she
was
to
suffer
with
her
children
and
to
starve
outright
or
to
live
in
just
as
might
befall
i
do
not
blame
the
bureau
chief
who
hated
to
do
what
he
did
although
he
lacked
the
courage
to
refuse
i
do
not
even
very
much
blame
the
senator
who
did
not
know
the
hardship
that
he
was
causing
and
who
had
been
calloused
by
long
training
in
the
spoils
system
but
this
system
a
system
which
permits
and
encourages
such
deeds
is
a
system
of
brutal
iniquity
any
man
accustomed
to
dealing
with
practical
politics
can
with
difficulty
keep
a
straight
face
when
he
reads
or
listens
to
some
of
the
arguments
advanced
against
civil
service
reform
one
of
these
arguments
a
favorite
with
machine
politicians
takes
the
form
of
an
appeal
to
party
loyalty
in
filling
minor
offices
why
again
and
again
these
very
same
machine
politicians
take
just
as
good
care
of
henchmen
of
the
opposite
party
as
of
those
of
their
own
party
in
the
underworld
of
politics
the
closest
ties
are
sometimes
those
which
knit
together
the
active
professional
workers
of
opposite
political
parties
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
new
york
legislature
the
hero
of
the
alpha
and
omega
incident
once
remarked
to
me
when
you
have
been
in
public
life
a
little
longer
roosevelt
you
will
understand
that
there
are
no
politics
in
politics
in
the
politics
to
which
he
was
referring
this
remark
could
be
taken
literally
another
illustration
of
this
truth
was
incidentally
given
me
at
about
the
same
time
by
an
acquaintance
a
tammany
man
named
costigan
a
good
fellow
according
to
his
lights
i
had
been
speaking
to
him
of
a
fight
in
one
of
the
new
york
downtown
districts
a
democratic
district
in
which
the
republican
party
was
in
a
hopeless
minority
and
moreover
was
split
into
the
and
stalwart
factions
it
had
been
an
interesting
fight
in
more
than
one
way
for
instance
the
republican
party
at
the
general
election
polled
something
like
five
hundred
and
fifty
votes
and
yet
at
the
primary
the
two
factions
polled
seven
hundred
and
all
told
the
sum
of
the
parts
was
thus
considerably
greater
than
the
whole
there
had
been
other
little
details
that
made
the
contest
worthy
of
note
the
hall
in
which
the
primary
was
held
had
been
hired
by
the
stalwarts
from
a
conscientious
gentleman
to
him
the
applied
to
know
whether
they
could
not
hire
the
hall
away
from
their
opponents
and
offered
him
a
substantial
money
advance
the
conscientious
gentleman
replied
that
his
word
was
as
good
as
his
bond
that
he
had
hired
the
hall
to
the
stalwarts
and
that
it
must
be
theirs
but
he
added
that
he
was
willing
to
hire
the
doorway
to
the
if
they
paid
him
the
additional
sum
of
money
they
had
mentioned
the
bargain
was
struck
and
the
meeting
of
the
hostile
hosts
was
spirited
when
the
men
who
had
rented
the
doorway
sought
to
bar
the
path
of
the
men
who
had
rented
the
hall
i
was
asking
my
friend
costigan
about
the
details
of
the
struggle
as
he
seemed
thoroughly
acquainted
with
them
and
he
smiled
over
my
surprise
at
there
having
been
more
votes
cast
than
there
were
members
of
the
party
in
the
whole
district
said
i
costigan
you
seem
to
have
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
about
this
how
did
it
happen
to
which
he
replied
come
now
roosevelt
you
know
it
the
same
gang
that
votes
in
all
the
primaries
so
much
for
most
of
the
opposition
to
the
reform
there
was
however
some
honest
and
at
least
partially
justifiable
opposition
both
to
certain
of
the
methods
advocated
by
civil
service
reformers
and
to
certain
of
the
civil
service
reformers
themselves
the
pet
shibboleths
of
the
opponents
of
the
reform
were
that
the
system
we
proposed
to
introduce
would
give
rise
to
mere
bureaucracy
and
that
the
reformers
were
pharisees
neither
statement
was
true
each
statement
contained
some
truth
if
men
are
not
to
be
appointed
by
favoritism
wise
or
unwise
honest
or
dishonest
they
must
be
appointed
in
some
automatic
way
which
generally
means
by
competitive
examination
the
easiest
kind
of
competitive
examination
is
an
examination
in
writing
this
is
entirely
appropriate
for
certain
classes
of
work
for
lawyers
stenographers
typewriters
clerks
mathematicians
and
assistants
in
an
astronomical
observatory
for
instance
it
is
utterly
inappropriate
for
carpenters
detectives
and
mounted
cattle
inspectors
along
the
rio
grande
to
instance
three
types
of
employment
as
to
which
i
had
to
do
battle
to
prevent
bureaucrats
from
insisting
on
written
competitive
entrance
examinations
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
hold
a
very
good
competitive
examination
for
mounted
cattle
inspectors
by
means
of
practical
tests
in
brand
reading
and
shooting
with
rifle
and
revolver
in
riding
mean
horses
and
in
roping
and
throwing
steers
i
did
my
best
to
have
examinations
of
this
kind
instituted
but
my
proposal
was
of
precisely
the
type
which
most
shocks
the
routine
official
mind
and
i
was
never
able
to
get
it
put
into
practical
effect
the
important
point
and
the
point
most
often
forgotten
by
zealous
civil
service
reformers
was
to
remember
that
the
routine
competitive
examination
was
merely
a
means
to
an
end
it
did
not
always
produce
ideal
results
but
it
was
normally
better
than
a
system
of
appointments
for
spoils
purposes
it
sometimes
worked
out
very
well
indeed
and
in
most
big
governmental
offices
it
not
only
gave
satisfactory
results
but
was
the
only
system
under
which
good
results
could
be
obtained
for
instance
when
i
was
police
commissioner
we
appointed
some
two
thousand
policemen
at
one
time
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
the
commissioners
each
to
examine
personally
the
six
or
eight
thousand
applicants
therefore
they
had
to
be
appointed
either
on
the
recommendation
of
outsiders
or
else
by
written
competitive
examination
the
latter
method
the
one
we
adopted
was
infinitely
preferable
we
held
a
rigid
physical
and
moral
pass
examination
and
then
among
those
who
passed
we
held
a
written
competitive
examination
requiring
only
the
knowledge
that
any
good
primary
common
school
education
would
meet
that
is
a
test
of
ordinary
intelligence
and
simple
mental
training
occasionally
a
man
who
would
have
been
a
good
officer
failed
and
occasionally
a
man
who
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
officer
passed
but
as
a
rule
the
men
with
intelligence
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
answer
the
questions
were
of
a
type
very
distinctly
above
that
of
those
who
failed
the
answers
returned
to
some
of
the
questions
gave
an
illuminating
idea
of
the
intelligence
of
those
answering
them
for
instance
one
of
our
questions
in
a
given
examination
was
a
request
to
name
five
of
the
new
england
states
one
competitor
obviously
of
foreign
birth
answered
england
ireland
scotland
wales
and
cork
his
neighbor
who
had
probably
looked
over
his
shoulder
but
who
had
north
of
ireland
prejudices
made
the
same
answer
except
that
he
substituted
belfast
for
cork
a
request
for
a
statement
as
to
the
life
of
abraham
lincoln
elicited
among
other
less
startling
pieces
of
information
the
fact
that
many
of
the
applicants
thought
that
he
was
a
general
in
the
civil
war
several
thought
that
he
was
president
of
the
confederate
states
three
thought
he
had
been
assassinated
by
jefferson
davis
one
by
thomas
jefferson
one
by
garfield
several
by
guiteau
and
one
by
ballington
booth
the
last
representing
a
memory
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
shot
by
a
man
named
booth
to
whose
surname
the
writer
added
the
name
with
which
he
was
most
familiar
in
connection
therewith
a
request
to
name
five
of
the
states
that
seceded
in
received
answers
that
included
almost
every
state
in
the
union
it
happened
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
silver
agitation
in
the
west
and
the
rocky
mountain
states
accordingly
figured
in
a
large
percentage
of
the
answers
some
of
the
men
thought
that
chicago
was
on
the
pacific
ocean
others
in
answer
to
a
query
as
to
who
was
the
head
of
the
united
states
government
wavered
between
myself
and
recorder
goff
one
brilliant
genius
for
inscrutable
reasons
placed
the
leadership
in
the
new
york
fire
department
now
of
course
some
of
the
men
who
answered
these
questions
wrong
were
nevertheless
quite
capable
of
making
good
policemen
but
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
on
the
average
the
candidate
who
has
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
the
government
geography
and
history
of
his
country
is
a
little
better
fitted
in
point
of
intelligence
to
be
a
policeman
than
the
one
who
has
not
therefore
i
felt
convinced
after
full
experience
that
as
regards
very
large
classes
of
public
servants
by
far
the
best
way
to
choose
the
men
for
appointment
was
by
means
of
written
competitive
examination
but
i
absolutely
split
off
from
the
bulk
of
my
professional
civil
service
reform
friends
when
they
advocated
written
competitive
examinations
for
promotion
in
the
police
department
i
found
these
examinations
a
serious
handicap
in
the
way
of
getting
the
best
men
promoted
and
never
in
any
office
did
i
find
that
the
written
competitive
promotion
examination
did
any
good
the
reason
for
a
written
competitive
entrance
examination
is
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
head
of
the
office
or
the
prospective
immediate
superior
himself
to
know
the
average
candidate
or
to
test
his
ability
but
when
once
in
office
the
best
way
to
test
any
man
ability
is
by
long
experience
in
seeing
him
actually
at
work
his
promotion
should
depend
upon
the
judgment
formed
of
him
by
his
superiors
so
much
for
the
objections
to
the
examinations
now
for
the
objections
to
the
men
who
advocated
the
reform
as
a
rule
these
men
were
and
disinterested
certain
of
them
men
like
the
leaders
in
the
maryland
and
indiana
reform
associations
for
instances
bonaparte
and
rose
foulke
and
swift
added
common
sense
broad
sympathy
and
practical
efficiency
to
their
but
in
new
york
philadelphia
and
boston
there
really
was
a
certain
mental
and
moral
thinness
among
very
many
of
the
leaders
in
the
civil
service
reform
movement
it
was
this
quality
which
made
them
so
profoundly
antipathetic
to
vigorous
and
intensely
human
people
of
the
stamp
of
my
friend
joe
murray
who
as
i
have
said
always
felt
that
my
civil
service
reform
affiliations
formed
the
one
blot
on
an
otherwise
excellent
public
record
the
civil
service
reform
movement
was
one
from
above
downwards
and
the
men
who
took
the
lead
in
it
were
not
men
who
as
a
rule
possessed
a
very
profound
sympathy
with
or
understanding
of
the
ways
of
thought
and
life
of
their
average
they
were
not
men
who
themselves
desired
to
be
or
clerks
or
policemen
or
to
have
their
friends
appointed
to
these
positions
having
no
temptation
themselves
in
this
direction
they
were
eagerly
anxious
to
prevent
other
people
getting
such
appointments
as
a
reward
for
political
services
in
this
they
were
quite
right
it
would
be
impossible
to
run
any
big
public
office
to
advantage
save
along
the
lines
of
the
strictest
application
of
civil
service
reform
principles
and
the
system
should
be
extended
throughout
our
governmental
service
far
more
widely
than
is
now
the
case
but
there
are
other
and
more
vital
reforms
than
this
too
many
civil
service
reformers
when
the
trial
came
proved
tepidly
indifferent
or
actively
hostile
to
reforms
that
were
of
profound
and
social
and
industrial
consequence
many
of
them
were
at
best
lukewarm
about
movements
for
the
improvement
of
the
conditions
of
toil
and
life
among
men
and
women
who
labor
under
hard
surroundings
and
were
positively
hostile
to
movements
which
curbed
the
power
of
the
great
corporation
magnates
and
directed
into
useful
instead
of
pernicious
channels
the
activities
of
the
great
corporation
lawyers
who
advised
them
most
of
the
newspapers
which
regarded
themselves
as
the
especial
champions
of
civil
service
reform
and
as
the
highest
exponents
of
civic
virtue
and
which
distrusted
the
average
citizen
and
shuddered
over
the
coarseness
of
the
professional
politicians
were
nevertheless
given
to
vices
even
more
contemptible
than
although
not
so
gross
as
those
they
denounced
and
derided
their
editors
were
refined
men
of
cultivated
tastes
whose
pet
temptations
were
backbiting
mean
slander
and
the
snobbish
worship
of
anything
clothed
in
wealth
and
the
outward
appearances
of
conventional
respectability
they
were
not
robust
or
powerful
men
they
felt
ill
at
ease
in
the
company
of
rough
strong
men
often
they
had
in
them
a
vein
of
physical
timidity
they
avenged
themselves
to
themselves
for
an
uneasy
subconsciousness
of
their
own
shortcomings
by
sitting
in
cloistered
or
rather
pleasantly
upholstered
seclusion
and
sneering
at
and
lying
about
men
who
made
them
feel
uncomfortable
sometimes
these
were
bad
men
who
made
them
feel
uncomfortable
by
the
exhibition
of
coarse
and
repellent
vice
and
sometimes
they
were
men
of
high
character
who
held
ideals
of
courage
and
of
service
to
others
and
who
looked
down
and
warred
against
the
shortcomings
of
swollen
wealth
and
the
effortless
easy
lives
of
those
whose
horizon
is
bounded
by
a
sheltered
and
timid
respectability
these
newspapers
owned
and
edited
by
these
men
although
free
from
the
repulsive
vulgarity
of
the
yellow
press
were
susceptible
to
influence
by
the
privileged
interests
and
were
almost
or
quite
as
hostile
to
manliness
as
they
were
to
unrefined
vice
and
were
much
more
hostile
to
it
than
to
the
typical
shortcomings
of
wealth
and
refinement
they
favored
civil
service
reform
they
favored
copyright
laws
and
the
removal
of
the
tariff
on
works
of
art
they
favored
all
the
proper
and
even
more
strongly
all
the
improper
movements
for
international
peace
and
arbitration
in
short
they
favored
all
good
and
many
measures
so
long
as
they
did
not
cut
deep
into
social
wrong
or
make
demands
on
national
and
individual
virility
they
opposed
or
were
lukewarm
about
efforts
to
build
up
the
army
and
the
navy
for
they
were
not
sensitive
concerning
national
honor
and
above
all
they
opposed
every
effort
however
sane
to
change
our
social
and
economic
system
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
substitute
the
ideal
of
justice
towards
all
for
the
ideal
of
kindly
charity
from
the
favored
few
to
the
possibly
grateful
many
some
of
the
men
foremost
in
the
struggle
for
civil
service
reform
have
taken
a
position
of
honorable
leadership
in
the
battle
for
those
other
and
more
vital
reforms
but
many
of
them
promptly
abandoned
the
field
of
effort
for
decency
when
the
battle
took
the
form
not
of
a
fight
against
the
petty
grafting
of
small
bosses
and
small
politicians
a
vitally
necessary
battle
be
it
remembered
but
of
a
fight
against
the
great
intrenched
powers
of
privilege
a
fight
to
secure
justice
through
the
law
for
ordinary
men
and
women
instead
of
leaving
them
to
suffer
cruel
injustice
either
because
the
law
failed
to
protect
them
or
because
it
was
twisted
from
its
legitimate
purposes
into
a
means
for
oppressing
them
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
boss
so
often
keeps
his
hold
especially
in
municipal
matters
is
or
at
least
has
been
in
the
past
because
so
many
of
the
men
who
claim
to
be
reformers
have
been
blind
to
the
need
of
working
in
human
fashion
for
social
and
industrial
betterment
such
words
as
boss
and
machine
now
imply
evil
but
both
the
implication
the
words
carry
and
the
definition
of
the
words
themselves
are
somewhat
vague
a
leader
is
necessary
but
his
opponents
always
call
him
a
boss
an
organization
is
necessary
but
the
men
in
opposition
always
call
it
a
machine
nevertheless
there
is
a
real
and
deep
distinction
between
the
leader
and
the
boss
between
organizations
and
machines
a
political
leader
who
fights
openly
for
principles
and
who
keeps
his
position
of
leadership
by
stirring
the
consciences
and
convincing
the
intellects
of
his
followers
so
that
they
have
confidence
in
him
and
will
follow
him
because
they
can
achieve
greater
results
under
him
than
under
any
one
else
is
doing
work
which
is
indispensable
in
a
democracy
the
boss
on
the
other
hand
is
a
man
who
does
not
gain
his
power
by
open
means
but
by
secret
means
and
usually
by
corrupt
means
some
of
the
worst
and
most
powerful
bosses
in
our
political
history
either
held
no
public
office
or
else
some
unimportant
public
office
they
made
no
appeal
either
to
intellect
or
conscience
their
work
was
done
behind
closed
doors
and
consisted
chiefly
in
the
use
of
that
greed
which
gives
in
order
that
in
return
it
may
get
a
boss
of
this
kind
can
pull
wires
in
conventions
can
manipulate
members
of
the
legislature
can
control
the
giving
or
withholding
of
office
and
serves
as
the
intermediary
for
bringing
together
the
powers
of
corrupt
politics
and
corrupt
business
if
he
is
at
one
end
of
the
social
scale
he
may
through
his
agents
traffic
in
the
most
brutal
forms
of
vice
and
give
protection
to
the
purveyors
of
shame
and
sin
in
return
for
money
bribes
if
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
he
may
be
the
means
of
securing
favors
from
high
public
officials
legislative
or
executive
to
great
industrial
interests
the
transaction
being
sometimes
a
naked
matter
of
bargain
and
sale
and
sometimes
being
carried
on
in
such
manner
that
both
parties
thereto
can
more
or
less
successfully
disguise
it
to
their
consciences
as
in
the
public
interest
the
machine
is
simply
another
name
for
the
kind
of
organization
which
is
certain
to
grow
up
in
a
party
or
section
of
a
party
controlled
by
such
bosses
as
these
and
by
their
henchmen
whereas
of
course
an
effective
organization
of
decent
men
is
essential
in
order
to
secure
decent
politics
if
these
bosses
were
responsible
for
nothing
but
pure
wickedness
they
would
probably
last
but
a
short
time
in
any
community
and
in
any
event
if
the
men
who
are
horrified
by
their
wickedness
were
themselves
as
practical
and
as
thoroughly
in
touch
with
human
nature
the
bosses
would
have
a
short
shrift
the
trouble
is
that
the
boss
does
understand
human
nature
and
that
he
fills
a
place
which
the
reformer
can
not
fill
unless
he
likewise
understands
human
nature
sometimes
the
boss
is
a
man
who
cares
for
political
power
purely
for
its
own
sake
as
he
might
care
for
any
other
hobby
more
often
he
has
in
view
some
definitely
selfish
object
such
as
political
or
financial
advancement
he
can
rarely
accomplish
much
unless
he
has
another
side
to
him
a
successful
boss
is
very
apt
to
be
a
man
who
in
addition
to
committing
wickedness
in
his
own
interest
also
does
look
after
the
interests
of
others
even
if
not
from
good
motives
there
are
some
communities
so
fortunate
that
there
are
very
few
men
who
have
private
interests
to
be
served
and
in
these
the
power
of
the
boss
is
at
a
minimum
there
are
many
country
communities
of
this
type
but
in
communities
where
there
is
poverty
and
ignorance
the
conditions
are
ripe
for
the
growth
of
a
boss
moreover
wherever
big
business
interests
are
liable
either
to
be
improperly
favored
or
improperly
discriminated
against
and
blackmailed
by
public
officials
and
the
result
is
just
as
vicious
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
boss
is
almost
certain
to
develop
the
best
way
of
getting
at
this
type
of
boss
is
by
keeping
the
public
conscience
aroused
and
alert
so
that
it
will
tolerate
neither
improper
attack
upon
nor
improper
favoritism
towards
these
corporations
and
will
quickly
punish
any
public
servant
guilty
of
either
there
is
often
much
good
in
the
type
of
boss
especially
common
in
big
cities
who
fulfills
towards
the
people
of
his
district
in
rough
and
ready
fashion
the
position
of
friend
and
protector
he
uses
his
influence
to
get
jobs
for
young
men
who
need
them
he
goes
into
court
for
a
wild
young
fellow
who
has
gotten
into
trouble
he
helps
out
with
cash
or
credit
the
widow
who
is
in
straits
or
the
breadwinner
who
is
crippled
or
for
some
other
cause
temporarily
out
of
work
he
organizes
clambakes
and
chowder
parties
and
picnics
and
is
consulted
by
the
local
labor
leaders
when
a
cut
in
wages
is
threatened
for
some
of
his
constituents
he
does
proper
favors
and
for
others
wholly
improper
favors
but
he
preserves
human
relations
with
all
he
may
be
a
very
bad
and
very
corrupt
man
a
man
whose
action
in
blackmailing
and
protecting
vice
is
of
damage
to
his
constituents
but
these
constituents
are
for
the
most
part
men
and
women
who
struggle
hard
against
poverty
and
with
whom
the
problem
of
living
is
very
real
and
very
close
they
would
prefer
clean
and
honest
government
if
this
clean
and
honest
government
is
accompanied
by
human
sympathy
human
understanding
but
an
appeal
made
to
them
for
virtue
in
the
abstract
an
appeal
made
by
good
men
who
do
not
really
understand
their
needs
will
often
pass
quite
unheeded
if
on
the
other
side
stands
the
boss
the
friend
and
benefactor
who
may
have
been
guilty
of
much
in
things
that
they
are
hardly
aware
concern
them
but
who
appeals
to
them
not
only
for
the
sake
of
favors
to
come
but
in
the
name
of
gratitude
and
loyalty
and
above
all
of
understanding
and
they
have
a
feeling
of
to
him
his
and
their
relations
may
be
substantially
those
which
are
right
and
proper
among
primitive
people
still
in
the
clan
stage
of
moral
development
the
successful
fight
against
this
type
of
vicious
boss
and
the
type
of
vicious
politics
which
produces
it
can
be
made
only
by
men
who
have
a
genuine
for
and
understanding
of
the
people
for
and
with
whom
they
are
to
work
and
who
in
practical
fashion
seek
their
social
and
industrial
benefit
there
are
communities
of
poor
men
whose
lives
are
hard
in
which
the
boss
though
he
would
be
out
of
place
in
a
more
advanced
community
if
fundamentally
an
honest
man
meets
a
real
need
which
would
otherwise
not
be
met
because
of
his
limitations
in
other
than
purely
local
matters
it
may
be
our
duty
to
fight
such
a
boss
but
it
may
also
be
our
duty
to
recognize
within
his
limitations
both
his
sincerity
and
his
usefulness
yet
again
even
the
boss
who
really
is
evil
like
the
business
man
who
really
is
evil
may
on
certain
points
be
sound
and
be
doing
good
work
it
may
be
the
highest
duty
of
the
patriotic
public
servant
to
work
with
the
big
boss
or
the
big
business
man
on
these
points
while
refusing
to
work
with
him
on
others
in
the
same
way
there
are
many
reformers
whose
conduct
is
such
as
to
warrant
tom
reed
bitter
remark
that
when
johnson
defined
patriotism
as
the
last
refuge
of
a
scoundrel
he
was
ignorant
of
the
infinite
possibilities
contained
in
the
word
reform
yet
none
the
less
it
is
our
duty
to
work
for
the
reforms
these
men
champion
without
regard
to
the
misconduct
of
the
men
themselves
on
other
points
i
have
known
in
my
life
many
big
business
men
and
many
big
political
bosses
who
often
or
even
generally
did
evil
but
who
on
some
occasions
and
on
certain
issues
were
right
i
never
hesitated
to
do
battle
against
these
men
when
they
were
wrong
and
on
the
other
hand
as
long
as
they
were
going
my
way
i
was
glad
to
have
them
do
so
to
have
repudiated
their
aid
when
they
were
right
and
were
striving
for
a
right
end
and
for
what
was
of
benefit
to
the
people
no
matter
what
their
motives
may
have
been
would
have
been
childish
and
moreover
would
have
itself
been
misconduct
against
the
people
my
duty
was
to
stand
with
every
one
while
he
was
right
and
to
stand
against
him
when
he
went
wrong
and
this
i
have
tried
to
do
as
regards
individuals
and
as
regards
groups
of
individuals
when
a
business
man
or
labor
leader
politician
or
reformer
is
right
i
support
him
when
he
goes
wrong
i
leave
him
when
lorimer
upheld
the
war
for
the
liberation
of
cuba
i
supported
him
when
he
became
united
states
senator
by
improper
methods
i
opposed
him
the
principles
or
methods
which
the
socialists
advocate
and
which
i
believe
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
people
i
support
and
those
which
i
believe
to
be
against
the
interest
of
the
people
i
oppose
moreover
when
a
man
has
done
evil
but
changes
and
works
for
decency
and
righteousness
and
when
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
change
is
real
and
the
man
conduct
sincere
then
i
welcome
him
and
work
heartily
with
him
as
an
equal
with
an
equal
for
thirty
years
after
the
civil
war
the
creed
of
mere
materialism
was
rampant
in
both
american
politics
and
american
business
and
many
many
strong
men
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
commercial
and
political
morality
did
things
for
which
they
deserve
blame
and
condemnation
but
if
they
now
sincerely
change
and
strive
for
better
things
it
is
unwise
and
unjust
to
bar
them
from
fellowship
so
long
as
they
work
for
evil
smite
them
with
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
when
they
change
and
show
their
faith
by
their
works
remember
the
words
of
ezekiel
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
the
sins
he
has
committed
and
keep
all
my
statutes
and
do
that
which
is
lawful
and
right
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
die
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
they
shall
not
be
mentioned
unto
him
in
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
he
shall
live
have
i
any
pleasure
at
all
that
the
wicked
should
die
saith
the
lord
god
and
not
that
he
should
return
from
his
ways
and
live
every
man
who
has
been
in
practical
politics
grows
to
realize
that
politicians
big
and
little
are
no
more
all
of
them
bad
than
they
are
all
of
them
good
many
of
these
men
are
very
bad
men
indeed
but
there
are
others
among
them
and
some
among
those
held
up
to
special
obloquy
too
who
even
although
they
may
have
done
much
that
is
evil
also
show
traits
of
sterling
worth
which
many
of
their
critics
wholly
lack
there
are
few
men
for
whom
i
have
ever
felt
a
more
cordial
and
contemptuous
dislike
than
for
some
of
the
bosses
and
big
professional
politicians
with
whom
i
have
been
brought
into
contact
on
the
other
hand
in
the
case
of
some
political
leaders
who
were
most
bitterly
attacked
as
bosses
i
grew
to
know
certain
sides
of
their
characters
which
inspired
in
me
a
very
genuine
regard
and
respect
to
read
much
of
the
assault
on
senator
hanna
one
would
have
thought
that
he
was
a
man
incapable
of
patriotism
or
of
devotion
to
the
country
good
i
was
brought
into
intimate
contact
with
him
only
during
the
two
and
a
half
years
immediately
preceding
his
death
i
was
then
president
and
perforce
watched
all
his
actions
at
close
range
during
that
time
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
rugged
sincerity
of
purpose
of
great
courage
and
loyalty
and
of
unswerving
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
nation
and
the
people
as
he
saw
those
interests
he
was
as
sincerely
desirous
of
helping
laboring
men
as
of
helping
capitalists
his
ideals
were
in
many
ways
not
my
ideals
and
there
were
points
where
both
by
temperament
and
by
conviction
we
were
far
apart
before
this
time
he
had
always
been
unfriendly
to
me
and
i
do
not
think
he
ever
grew
to
like
me
at
any
rate
not
until
the
very
end
of
his
life
moreover
i
came
to
the
presidency
under
circumstances
which
if
he
had
been
a
smaller
man
would
inevitably
have
thrown
him
into
violent
antagonism
to
me
he
was
the
close
and
intimate
friend
of
president
mckinley
he
was
mckinley
devoted
ally
and
follower
and
his
trusted
adviser
who
was
in
complete
sympathy
with
him
partly
because
of
this
friendship
his
position
in
the
senate
and
in
the
country
was
unique
with
mckinley
sudden
death
senator
hanna
found
himself
bereft
of
his
dearest
friend
while
i
who
had
just
come
to
the
presidency
was
in
his
view
an
untried
man
whose
trustworthiness
on
many
public
questions
was
at
least
doubtful
ordinarily
as
has
been
shown
not
only
in
our
history
but
in
the
history
of
all
other
countries
in
countless
instances
over
and
over
again
this
situation
would
have
meant
suspicion
ill
will
and
at
the
last
open
and
violent
antagonism
such
was
not
the
result
in
this
case
primarily
because
senator
hanna
had
in
him
the
quality
that
enabled
him
to
meet
a
serious
crisis
with
dignity
with
power
and
with
disinterested
desire
to
work
for
the
common
good
within
a
few
days
of
my
accession
he
called
on
me
and
with
entire
friendliness
and
obvious
sincerity
but
also
with
entire
explained
that
he
mourned
mckinley
as
probably
no
other
man
did
that
he
had
not
been
especially
my
friend
but
that
he
wished
me
to
understand
that
thenceforward
on
every
question
where
he
could
conscientiously
support
me
i
could
count
upon
his
giving
me
as
loyal
aid
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
render
he
added
that
this
must
not
be
understood
as
committing
him
to
favor
me
for
nomination
and
election
because
that
matter
must
be
left
to
take
care
of
itself
as
events
should
decide
but
that
aside
from
this
what
he
said
was
to
be
taken
literally
in
other
words
he
would
do
his
best
to
make
my
administration
a
success
by
supporting
me
heartily
on
every
point
on
which
he
conscientiously
could
and
that
this
i
could
count
upon
he
kept
his
word
absolutely
he
never
became
especially
favorable
to
my
nomination
and
most
of
his
close
friends
became
bitterly
opposed
to
me
and
used
every
effort
to
persuade
him
to
try
to
bring
about
my
downfall
most
men
in
his
position
would
have
been
tempted
to
try
to
make
capital
at
my
expense
by
antagonizing
me
and
discrediting
me
so
as
to
make
my
policies
fail
just
for
the
sake
of
making
them
fail
senator
hanna
on
the
contrary
did
everything
possible
to
make
them
succeed
he
kept
his
word
in
the
letter
and
the
spirit
and
on
every
point
on
which
he
felt
conscientiously
able
to
support
me
he
gave
me
the
heartiest
and
most
effective
support
and
did
all
in
his
power
to
make
my
administration
a
success
and
this
with
no
hope
of
any
reward
for
himself
of
any
gratitude
from
me
or
of
any
appreciation
by
the
public
at
large
but
solely
because
he
deemed
such
action
necessary
for
the
of
the
country
as
a
whole
my
experience
with
senator
quay
was
similar
i
had
no
personal
relations
with
him
before
i
was
president
and
knew
nothing
of
him
save
by
hearsay
soon
after
i
became
president
senator
quay
called
upon
me
told
me
he
had
known
me
very
slightly
that
he
thought
most
men
who
claimed
to
be
reformers
were
hypocrites
but
that
he
deemed
me
sincere
that
he
thought
conditions
had
become
such
that
aggressive
courage
and
honesty
were
necessary
in
order
to
remedy
them
that
he
believed
i
intended
to
be
a
good
and
efficient
president
and
that
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
would
support
me
in
it
making
my
administration
a
success
he
kept
his
word
with
absolute
good
faith
he
had
been
in
the
civil
war
and
was
a
medal
of
honor
man
and
i
think
my
having
been
in
the
spanish
war
gave
him
at
the
outset
a
kindly
feeling
toward
me
he
was
also
a
very
man
i
owe
to
him
for
instance
my
acquaintance
with
the
writings
of
the
finnish
novelist
topelius
not
only
did
he
support
me
on
almost
every
public
question
in
which
i
was
most
interested
including
i
am
convinced
every
one
on
which
he
felt
he
conscientiously
could
do
so
but
he
also
at
the
time
of
his
death
gave
a
striking
proof
of
his
disinterested
desire
to
render
a
service
to
certain
poor
people
and
this
under
conditions
in
which
not
only
would
he
never
know
if
the
service
were
rendered
but
in
which
he
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
his
part
in
it
would
ever
be
made
known
to
any
other
man
quay
was
descended
from
a
french
voyageur
who
had
some
indian
blood
in
him
he
was
proud
of
this
indian
blood
took
an
especial
interest
in
indians
and
whenever
indians
came
to
washington
they
always
called
on
him
once
during
my
administration
a
delegation
of
iroquois
came
over
from
canada
to
call
on
me
at
the
white
house
their
visit
had
in
it
something
that
was
pathetic
as
well
as
amusing
they
represented
the
descendants
of
the
six
nations
who
fled
to
canada
after
sullivan
harried
their
towns
in
the
revolutionary
war
now
a
century
and
a
quarter
later
their
people
thought
that
they
would
like
to
come
back
into
the
united
states
and
these
representatives
had
called
upon
me
with
the
dim
hope
that
perhaps
i
could
give
their
tribes
land
on
which
they
could
settle
as
soon
as
they
reached
washington
they
asked
quay
to
bring
them
to
call
on
me
which
he
did
telling
me
that
of
course
their
errand
was
hopeless
and
that
he
had
explained
as
much
to
them
but
that
they
would
like
me
to
extend
the
courtesy
of
an
interview
at
the
close
of
the
interview
which
had
been
conducted
with
all
the
solemnities
of
calumet
and
wampum
the
indians
filed
out
quay
before
following
them
turned
to
me
with
his
usual
emotionless
face
and
said
president
this
reminds
one
of
the
flight
of
a
tartar
tribe
it
i
answered
so
you
fond
of
de
quincey
senator
to
which
quay
responded
yes
always
liked
de
quincey
and
away
he
went
with
the
tribesmen
who
seemed
to
have
walked
out
of
a
remote
past
quay
had
become
particularly
concerned
about
the
delawares
in
the
indian
territory
he
felt
that
the
interior
department
did
not
do
them
justice
he
also
felt
that
his
colleagues
of
the
senate
took
no
interest
in
them
when
in
the
spring
of
he
lay
in
his
house
mortally
sick
he
sent
me
word
that
he
had
something
important
to
say
to
me
and
would
have
himself
carried
round
to
see
me
i
sent
back
word
not
to
think
of
doing
so
and
that
on
my
way
back
from
church
next
sunday
i
would
stop
in
and
call
on
him
this
i
accordingly
did
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
death
written
on
his
face
he
thanked
me
for
coming
and
then
explained
that
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
death
and
knew
he
would
never
return
to
washington
it
was
late
spring
and
he
was
about
to
leave
he
wished
to
see
me
to
get
my
personal
promise
that
after
he
died
i
would
myself
look
after
the
interests
of
the
delaware
indians
he
added
that
he
did
not
trust
the
interior
department
although
he
knew
that
i
did
not
share
his
views
on
this
point
and
that
still
less
did
he
believe
that
any
of
his
colleagues
in
the
senate
would
exert
themselves
in
the
interests
of
the
delawares
and
that
therefore
he
wished
my
personal
assurance
that
i
would
personally
see
that
no
injustice
was
done
them
i
told
him
i
would
do
so
and
then
added
in
rather
perfunctory
fashion
that
he
must
not
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
himself
that
when
he
got
away
for
the
summer
i
hoped
he
would
recover
and
be
back
all
right
when
congress
opened
a
gleam
came
into
the
old
fighter
eyes
and
he
answered
no
i
am
dying
and
you
know
it
i
do
mind
dying
but
i
do
wish
it
were
possible
for
me
to
get
off
into
the
great
north
woods
and
crawl
out
on
a
rock
in
the
sun
and
die
like
a
wolf
i
never
saw
him
again
when
he
died
i
sent
a
telegram
of
sympathy
to
his
wife
a
paper
which
constantly
preached
reform
and
which
kept
up
its
circulation
by
the
no
less
constant
practice
of
slander
a
paper
which
in
theory
condemned
all
public
men
who
violated
the
eighth
commandment
and
in
practice
subsisted
by
incessant
violation
of
the
ninth
assailed
me
for
sending
my
message
to
the
dead
man
wife
i
knew
the
editors
of
this
paper
and
the
editor
who
was
their
predecessor
they
had
led
lives
of
bodily
ease
and
the
avoidance
of
bodily
risk
they
earned
their
livelihood
by
the
practice
of
mendacity
for
profit
and
they
delivered
malignant
judgment
on
a
dead
man
who
whatever
his
faults
had
in
his
youth
freely
risked
his
life
for
a
great
ideal
and
who
when
death
was
already
clutching
his
breast
had
spent
almost
his
last
breath
on
behalf
of
humble
and
friendless
people
whom
he
had
served
with
disinterested
loyalty
there
is
no
greater
duty
than
to
war
on
the
corrupt
and
unprincipled
boss
and
on
the
corrupt
and
unprincipled
business
man
and
for
the
matter
of
that
on
the
corrupt
and
unprincipled
labor
leader
also
and
on
the
corrupt
and
unprincipled
editor
and
on
any
one
else
who
is
corrupt
and
unprincipled
but
where
the
conditions
are
such
whether
in
politics
or
in
business
that
the
great
majority
of
men
have
behaved
in
a
way
which
is
gradually
seen
to
be
improper
but
which
at
one
time
did
not
conflict
with
the
generally
accepted
morality
then
the
warfare
on
the
system
should
not
include
warfare
on
the
men
themselves
unless
they
decline
to
amend
their
ways
and
to
dissociate
themselves
from
the
system
there
are
many
good
unimaginative
citizens
who
in
politics
or
in
business
act
in
accordance
with
accepted
standards
in
a
way
without
questioning
these
standards
until
something
happens
which
sharply
arouses
them
to
the
situation
whereupon
they
try
to
work
for
better
things
the
proper
course
in
such
event
is
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
if
the
men
prove
by
their
actions
the
sincerity
of
their
conversion
heartily
to
work
with
them
for
the
betterment
of
business
and
political
conditions
by
the
time
that
i
was
ending
my
career
as
civil
service
commissioner
i
was
already
growing
to
understand
that
mere
improvement
in
political
conditions
by
itself
was
not
enough
i
dimly
realized
that
an
even
greater
fight
must
be
waged
to
improve
economic
conditions
and
to
secure
social
and
industrial
justice
justice
as
between
individuals
and
justice
as
between
classes
i
began
to
see
that
political
effort
was
largely
valuable
as
it
found
expression
and
resulted
in
such
social
and
industrial
betterment
i
was
gradually
puzzling
out
or
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
answers
to
various
questions
some
as
yet
unsolvable
to
any
of
us
but
for
the
solution
of
which
it
is
the
bounden
duty
of
all
of
us
to
work
i
had
grown
to
realize
very
keenly
that
the
duty
of
the
government
to
protect
women
and
children
must
be
extended
to
include
the
protection
of
all
the
crushable
elements
of
labor
i
saw
that
it
was
the
affair
of
all
our
people
to
see
that
justice
obtained
between
the
big
corporation
and
its
employees
and
between
the
big
corporation
and
its
smaller
rivals
as
well
as
its
customers
and
the
general
public
i
saw
that
it
was
the
affair
of
all
of
us
and
not
only
of
the
employer
if
dividends
went
up
and
wages
went
down
that
it
was
to
the
interest
of
all
of
us
that
a
full
share
of
the
benefit
of
improved
machinery
should
go
to
the
workman
who
used
the
machinery
and
also
that
it
was
to
the
interest
of
all
of
us
that
each
man
whether
brain
worker
or
hand
worker
should
do
the
best
work
of
which
he
was
capable
and
that
there
should
be
some
correspondence
between
the
value
of
the
work
and
the
value
of
the
reward
it
is
these
and
many
similar
questions
which
in
their
sum
make
up
the
great
social
and
industrial
problems
of
the
most
interesting
and
important
of
the
problems
with
which
our
public
life
must
deal
in
handling
these
problems
i
believe
that
much
can
be
done
by
the
government
furthermore
i
believe
that
after
all
that
the
government
can
do
has
been
done
there
will
remain
as
the
most
vital
of
all
factors
the
individual
character
of
the
average
man
and
the
average
woman
no
governmental
action
can
do
more
than
supplement
individual
action
moreover
there
must
be
collective
action
of
kinds
distinct
from
governmental
action
a
body
of
public
opinion
must
be
formed
must
make
itself
felt
and
in
the
end
transform
and
be
transformed
by
the
gradual
raising
of
individual
standards
of
conduct
it
is
curious
to
see
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
some
men
understand
that
insistence
upon
one
factor
does
not
and
must
not
mean
failure
fully
to
recognize
other
factors
the
selfish
individual
needs
to
be
taught
that
we
must
now
shackle
cunning
by
law
exactly
as
a
few
centuries
back
we
shackled
force
by
law
unrestricted
individualism
spells
ruin
to
the
individual
himself
but
so
does
the
elimination
of
individualism
whether
by
law
or
custom
it
is
a
capital
error
to
fail
to
recognize
the
vital
need
of
good
laws
it
is
also
a
capital
error
to
believe
that
good
laws
will
accomplish
anything
unless
the
average
man
has
the
right
stuff
in
him
the
toiler
the
manual
laborer
has
received
less
than
justice
and
he
must
be
protected
both
by
law
by
custom
and
by
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
increase
his
wage
and
yet
to
decrease
the
quantity
and
quality
of
his
work
will
work
only
evil
there
must
be
a
far
greater
meed
of
respect
and
reward
for
the
hand
worker
than
we
now
give
him
if
our
society
is
to
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
and
this
respect
and
reward
can
not
be
given
him
unless
he
is
as
ambitious
to
do
the
best
possible
work
as
is
the
highest
type
of
brain
worker
whether
doctor
or
writer
or
artist
there
must
be
a
raising
of
standards
and
not
a
leveling
down
to
the
standard
of
the
poorest
and
most
inefficient
there
is
urgent
need
of
intelligent
governmental
action
to
assist
in
making
the
life
of
the
man
who
tills
the
soil
all
that
it
should
be
and
to
see
that
the
manual
worker
gets
his
full
share
of
the
reward
for
what
he
helps
produce
but
if
either
farmer
mechanic
or
day
laborer
is
shiftless
or
lazy
if
he
shirks
downright
hard
work
if
he
is
stupid
or
then
no
law
can
save
him
and
he
must
give
way
to
a
better
type
i
suppose
that
some
good
people
will
misunderstand
what
i
say
and
will
insist
on
taking
only
half
of
it
as
representing
the
whole
let
me
repeat
when
i
say
that
even
after
we
have
all
the
good
laws
necessary
the
chief
factor
in
any
given
man
success
or
failure
must
be
that
man
own
character
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
i
am
in
the
least
minimizing
the
importance
of
these
laws
the
real
and
vital
need
for
them
the
struggle
for
individual
advancement
and
development
can
be
brought
to
naught
or
indefinitely
retarded
by
the
absence
of
law
or
by
bad
law
it
can
be
immeasurably
aided
by
organized
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
collective
action
and
individual
action
public
law
and
private
character
are
both
necessary
it
is
only
by
a
slow
and
patient
inward
transformation
such
as
these
laws
aid
in
bringing
about
that
men
are
really
helped
upward
in
their
struggle
for
a
higher
and
a
fuller
life
recognition
of
individual
character
as
the
most
important
of
all
factors
does
not
mean
failure
fully
to
recognize
that
we
must
have
good
laws
and
that
we
must
have
our
best
men
in
office
to
enforce
these
laws
the
nation
collectively
will
in
this
way
be
able
to
be
of
real
and
genuine
service
to
each
of
us
individually
and
on
the
other
hand
the
wisdom
of
the
collective
action
will
mainly
depend
on
the
high
individual
average
of
citizenship
the
relationship
of
man
and
woman
is
the
fundamental
relationship
that
stands
at
the
base
of
the
whole
social
structure
much
can
be
done
by
law
towards
putting
women
on
a
footing
of
complete
and
entire
equal
rights
with
man
including
the
right
to
vote
the
right
to
hold
and
use
property
and
the
right
to
enter
any
profession
she
desires
on
the
same
terms
as
a
man
yet
when
this
has
been
done
it
will
amount
to
little
unless
on
the
one
hand
the
man
himself
realizes
his
duty
to
the
woman
and
unless
on
the
other
hand
the
woman
realizes
that
she
has
no
claim
to
rights
unless
she
performs
the
duties
that
go
with
those
rights
and
that
alone
justify
her
in
appealing
to
them
a
cruel
selfish
or
licentious
man
is
an
abhorrent
member
of
the
community
but
after
all
his
actions
are
no
worse
in
the
long
run
than
those
of
the
woman
who
is
content
to
be
a
parasite
on
others
who
is
cold
selfish
caring
for
nothing
but
frivolous
pleasure
and
ignoble
ease
the
law
of
worthy
effort
the
law
of
service
for
a
worthy
end
without
regard
to
whether
it
brings
pleasure
or
pain
is
the
only
right
law
of
life
whether
for
man
or
for
woman
the
man
must
not
be
selfish
nor
if
the
woman
is
wise
will
she
let
the
man
grow
selfish
and
this
not
only
for
her
own
sake
but
for
his
one
of
the
prime
needs
is
to
remember
that
almost
every
duty
is
composed
of
two
seemingly
conflicting
elements
and
that
on
one
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
may
defeat
its
own
end
any
man
who
studies
the
statistics
of
the
among
the
native
americans
of
new
england
or
among
the
native
french
of
france
needs
not
to
be
told
that
when
prudence
and
forethought
are
carried
to
the
point
of
cold
selfishness
and
the
race
is
bound
to
disappear
taking
into
account
the
women
who
for
good
reasons
do
not
marry
or
who
when
married
are
childless
or
are
able
to
have
but
one
or
two
children
it
is
evident
that
the
married
woman
able
to
have
children
must
on
an
average
have
four
or
the
race
will
not
perpetuate
itself
this
is
the
mere
statement
of
a
truth
yet
foolish
and
people
often
resent
this
statement
as
if
it
were
in
some
way
possible
by
denunciation
to
reverse
the
facts
of
nature
and
on
the
other
hand
improvident
and
shiftless
people
inconsiderate
and
brutal
people
treat
the
statement
as
if
it
justified
heads
of
families
in
having
enormous
numbers
of
badly
nourished
badly
brought
up
and
badly
cared
for
children
for
whom
they
make
no
effort
to
provide
a
man
must
think
well
before
he
marries
he
must
be
a
tender
and
considerate
husband
and
realize
that
there
is
no
other
human
being
to
whom
he
owes
so
much
of
love
and
regard
and
consideration
as
he
does
to
the
woman
who
with
pain
bears
and
with
labor
rears
the
children
that
are
his
no
words
can
paint
the
scorn
and
contempt
which
must
be
felt
by
all
men
not
only
for
the
brutal
husband
but
for
the
husband
who
fails
to
show
full
loyalty
and
consideration
to
his
wife
moreover
he
must
work
he
must
do
his
part
in
the
world
on
the
other
hand
the
woman
must
realize
that
she
has
no
more
right
to
shirk
the
business
of
wifehood
and
motherhood
than
the
man
has
to
shirk
his
business
as
breadwinner
for
the
household
women
should
have
free
access
to
every
field
of
labor
which
they
care
to
enter
and
when
their
work
is
as
valuable
as
that
of
a
man
it
should
be
paid
as
highly
yet
normally
for
the
man
and
the
woman
whose
welfare
is
more
important
than
the
welfare
of
any
other
human
beings
the
woman
must
remain
the
housemother
the
homekeeper
and
the
man
must
remain
the
breadwinner
the
provider
for
the
wife
who
bears
his
children
and
for
the
children
she
brings
into
the
world
no
other
work
is
as
valuable
or
as
exacting
for
either
man
or
woman
it
must
always
in
every
healthy
society
be
for
both
man
and
woman
the
prime
work
the
most
important
work
normally
all
other
work
is
of
secondary
importance
and
must
come
as
an
addition
to
not
a
substitute
for
this
primary
work
the
partnership
should
be
one
of
equal
rights
one
of
love
of
and
unselfishness
above
all
a
partnership
for
the
performance
of
the
most
vitally
important
of
all
duties
the
performance
of
duty
and
not
an
indulgence
in
vapid
ease
and
vapid
pleasure
is
all
that
makes
life
worth
while
suffrage
for
women
should
be
looked
on
from
this
standpoint
personally
i
feel
that
it
is
exactly
as
much
a
right
of
women
as
of
men
to
vote
but
the
important
point
with
both
men
and
women
is
to
treat
the
exercise
of
the
suffrage
as
a
duty
which
in
the
long
run
must
be
well
performed
to
be
of
the
slightest
value
i
always
favored
suffrage
but
only
tepidly
until
my
association
with
women
like
jane
addams
and
frances
kellor
who
desired
it
as
one
means
of
enabling
them
to
render
better
and
more
efficient
service
changed
me
into
a
zealous
instead
of
a
lukewarm
adherent
of
the
cause
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
few
of
the
best
women
of
the
same
type
women
like
mary
antin
did
not
favor
the
movement
a
vote
is
like
a
rifle
its
usefulness
depends
upon
the
character
of
the
user
the
mere
possession
of
the
vote
will
no
more
benefit
men
and
women
not
sufficiently
developed
to
use
it
than
the
possession
of
rifles
will
turn
untrained
egyptian
fellaheen
into
soldiers
this
is
as
true
of
woman
as
of
man
and
no
more
true
universal
suffrage
in
hayti
has
not
made
the
haytians
able
to
govern
themselves
in
any
true
sense
and
woman
suffrage
in
utah
in
no
shape
or
way
affected
the
problem
of
polygamy
i
believe
in
suffrage
for
women
in
america
because
i
think
they
are
fit
for
it
i
believe
for
women
as
for
men
more
in
the
duty
of
fitting
one
self
to
do
well
and
wisely
with
the
ballot
than
in
the
naked
right
to
cast
the
ballot
i
wish
that
people
would
read
books
like
the
novels
and
stories
at
once
strong
and
charming
of
henry
bordeaux
books
like
kathleen
mother
and
cornelia
comer
preliminaries
and
would
use
these
and
other
such
books
as
tracts
now
and
then
perhaps
the
following
correspondence
will
give
a
better
idea
than
i
can
otherwise
give
of
the
problems
that
in
everyday
life
come
before
men
and
women
and
of
the
need
that
the
man
shall
show
himself
unselfish
and
considerate
and
do
his
full
share
of
the
joint
duty
january
theodore
dear
sir
i
suppose
you
are
willing
to
stand
sponsor
for
the
assertion
that
the
women
of
the
country
are
not
doing
their
duty
unless
they
have
large
families
i
wonder
if
you
know
the
real
reason
after
all
society
and
clubs
are
held
largely
to
blame
but
society
really
takes
in
so
few
people
after
all
i
thought
when
i
got
married
at
twenty
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
have
a
family
and
as
we
had
very
little
of
this
world
goods
also
thought
it
the
thing
to
do
all
the
necessary
work
for
them
i
have
had
nine
children
did
all
my
own
work
including
washing
ironing
and
the
care
of
the
little
ones
as
they
came
along
which
was
about
every
two
years
also
sewed
everything
they
wore
including
trousers
for
the
boys
and
caps
and
jackets
for
the
girls
while
little
i
also
helped
them
all
in
their
school
work
and
started
them
in
music
etc
but
as
they
grew
older
i
got
behind
the
times
i
never
belonged
to
a
club
or
a
society
or
lodge
nor
went
to
any
one
house
scarcely
there
was
time
in
consequence
i
knew
nothing
that
was
going
on
in
the
town
much
less
the
events
of
the
country
and
at
the
same
time
my
husband
kept
growing
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
from
mixing
with
men
and
hearing
topics
of
the
times
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
our
married
life
i
had
just
as
quick
a
mind
to
grasp
things
as
he
did
and
had
more
school
education
having
graduated
from
a
three
years
high
school
my
husband
more
and
more
declined
to
discuss
things
with
me
as
he
said
i
did
know
anything
about
it
when
i
ask
he
say
oh
you
would
understand
if
i
tell
you
so
here
i
am
at
years
hopelessly
dull
and
uninteresting
while
he
can
mix
with
the
brightest
minds
in
the
country
as
an
equal
he
a
strong
progressive
man
took
very
active
part
in
the
late
campaign
etc
i
am
also
progressive
and
tried
my
best
after
so
many
years
of
life
to
grasp
the
ideas
you
stood
for
and
read
everything
i
could
find
during
the
summer
and
fall
but
i
been
out
of
touch
with
people
too
long
now
and
my
husband
would
much
rather
go
and
talk
to
some
woman
who
has
had
any
children
because
she
knows
things
i
am
not
specifying
any
particular
woman
i
simply
bore
him
to
death
because
i
not
interesting
now
tell
me
how
was
it
my
fault
i
was
only
doing
what
i
thought
was
my
duty
no
woman
can
keep
up
with
things
who
never
talks
with
any
one
but
young
children
as
soon
as
my
children
grew
up
they
took
the
same
attitude
as
their
father
and
frequently
say
oh
mother
does
know
they
look
up
to
and
admire
their
father
because
he
a
man
of
the
world
and
knows
how
to
act
when
he
goes
out
how
can
i
urge
my
daughters
now
to
go
and
raise
large
families
it
means
by
the
time
you
have
lost
your
figure
and
charm
for
them
they
are
all
ashamed
of
you
now
as
a
believer
in
woman
rights
do
a
little
talking
to
the
men
as
to
their
duties
to
their
wives
or
else
refrain
from
urging
us
women
to
have
children
i
am
only
one
of
thousands
of
respectable
women
who
give
their
lives
to
raise
a
nice
family
and
then
who
become
bitter
from
the
injustice
done
us
do
let
this
go
into
the
but
think
it
over
yours
respectfully
new
york
january
dear
most
certainly
your
letter
will
not
go
into
the
basket
i
shall
think
it
over
and
show
it
to
roosevelt
will
you
let
me
say
in
the
first
place
that
a
woman
who
can
write
such
a
letter
is
certainly
not
hopelessly
dull
and
uninteresting
if
the
facts
are
as
you
state
then
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
feel
bitterly
and
that
you
feel
that
the
gravest
kind
of
injustice
has
been
done
you
i
have
always
tried
to
insist
to
men
that
they
should
do
their
duty
to
the
women
even
more
than
the
women
to
them
now
i
hardly
like
to
write
specifically
about
your
husband
because
you
might
not
like
it
yourself
it
seems
to
me
almost
incredible
that
any
man
who
is
the
husband
of
a
woman
who
has
borne
him
nine
children
should
not
feel
that
they
and
he
are
lastingly
her
debtors
you
say
that
you
have
had
nine
children
that
you
did
all
your
own
work
including
washing
ironing
and
the
care
of
the
little
ones
as
they
came
along
that
you
sewed
everything
they
wore
including
trousers
for
the
boys
and
caps
and
jackets
for
the
girls
while
little
that
you
helped
them
all
in
their
school
work
and
started
them
in
music
but
that
as
they
grew
older
you
got
behind
the
times
that
you
never
belonged
to
a
club
or
society
or
lodge
nor
went
to
any
one
house
as
you
hardly
had
time
to
do
so
and
that
in
consequence
your
husband
outgrew
you
and
that
your
children
look
up
to
him
and
not
to
you
and
feel
that
they
have
outgrown
you
if
these
facts
are
so
you
have
done
a
great
and
wonderful
work
and
the
only
explanation
i
can
possibly
give
of
the
attitude
you
describe
on
the
part
of
your
husband
and
children
is
that
they
do
not
understand
what
it
is
that
you
have
done
i
emphatically
believe
in
unselfishness
but
i
also
believe
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
let
other
people
grow
selfish
even
when
the
other
people
are
husband
and
children
now
i
suggest
that
you
take
your
letter
to
me
of
which
i
send
you
back
a
copy
and
this
letter
and
then
select
out
of
your
family
the
one
with
whom
you
feel
most
sympathy
whether
it
is
your
husband
or
one
of
your
children
show
the
two
letters
to
him
or
her
and
then
have
a
frank
talk
about
the
matter
if
any
man
as
you
say
becomes
ashamed
of
his
wife
because
she
has
lost
her
figure
in
bearing
his
children
then
that
man
is
a
hound
and
has
every
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
i
am
sending
you
a
little
book
called
mother
by
kathleen
norris
which
will
give
you
my
views
on
the
matter
of
course
there
are
base
and
selfish
men
just
as
there
are
although
i
believe
in
smaller
number
base
and
selfish
women
man
and
woman
alike
should
profit
by
the
teachings
in
such
a
story
as
this
of
mother
sincerely
yours
theodore
roosevelt
january
theodore
my
dear
sir
your
letter
came
as
a
surprise
for
i
was
expecting
an
answer
the
next
day
the
book
came
and
i
thank
you
for
your
ready
sympathy
and
understanding
i
feel
as
though
you
and
roosevelt
would
think
i
was
hardly
loyal
to
my
husband
and
children
but
knowing
of
no
other
way
to
bring
the
idea
which
was
so
strong
in
my
mind
to
your
notice
i
told
my
personal
story
if
it
will
in
a
small
measure
be
the
means
of
helping
some
one
else
by
molding
public
opinion
through
you
i
shall
be
content
you
have
helped
me
more
than
you
know
just
having
you
interested
is
as
good
as
a
tonic
and
braces
me
up
till
i
feel
as
though
i
shall
refuse
to
be
laid
on
the
shelf
to
think
that
bother
to
send
me
a
book
i
shall
always
treasure
it
both
for
the
text
of
the
book
and
the
sender
i
read
it
with
absorbing
interest
the
mother
was
so
splendid
she
was
ideal
the
situations
are
so
startlingly
real
just
like
what
happens
here
every
day
with
variations
a
narrative
of
facts
is
often
more
convincing
than
a
homily
and
these
two
letters
of
my
correspondent
carry
their
own
lesson
parenthetically
let
me
remark
that
whenever
a
man
thinks
that
he
has
outgrown
the
woman
who
is
his
mate
he
will
do
well
carefully
to
consider
whether
his
growth
has
not
been
downward
instead
of
upward
whether
the
facts
are
not
merely
that
he
has
fallen
away
from
his
standard
of
refinement
and
of
duty
chapter
vi
the
new
york
police
in
the
spring
of
i
was
appointed
by
mayor
strong
police
commissioner
and
i
served
as
president
of
the
police
commission
of
new
york
for
the
two
following
years
mayor
strong
had
been
elected
mayor
the
preceding
fall
when
the
general
wave
of
that
year
coincided
with
one
of
the
city
occasional
insurrections
of
virtue
and
consequent
turning
out
of
tammany
from
municipal
control
he
had
been
elected
on
a
ticket
usually
although
not
always
the
right
kind
of
ticket
in
municipal
affairs
provided
it
represents
not
a
bargain
among
factions
but
genuine
with
the
genuine
purpose
to
get
the
right
men
in
control
of
the
city
government
on
a
platform
which
deals
with
the
needs
of
the
average
men
and
women
the
men
and
women
who
work
hard
and
who
too
often
live
hard
i
was
appointed
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
i
was
to
administer
the
police
department
with
entire
disregard
of
partisan
politics
and
only
from
the
standpoint
of
a
good
citizen
interested
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
all
good
citizens
my
task
therefore
was
really
simple
mayor
strong
had
already
offered
me
the
department
for
this
work
i
did
not
feel
that
i
had
any
especial
fitness
i
resolutely
refused
to
accept
the
position
and
the
mayor
ultimately
got
a
far
better
man
for
his
purpose
in
colonel
george
waring
the
work
of
the
police
department
however
was
in
my
line
and
i
was
glad
to
undertake
it
the
man
who
was
closest
to
me
throughout
my
two
years
in
the
police
department
was
jacob
riis
by
this
time
as
i
have
said
i
was
getting
our
social
industrial
and
political
needs
into
pretty
fair
perspective
i
was
still
ignorant
of
the
extent
to
which
big
men
of
great
wealth
played
a
mischievous
part
in
our
industrial
and
social
life
but
i
was
well
awake
to
the
need
of
making
ours
in
good
faith
both
an
economic
and
an
industrial
as
well
as
a
political
democracy
i
already
knew
jake
riis
because
his
book
how
the
other
half
lives
had
been
to
me
both
an
enlightenment
and
an
inspiration
for
which
i
felt
i
could
never
be
too
grateful
soon
after
it
was
written
i
had
called
at
his
office
to
tell
him
how
deeply
impressed
i
was
by
the
book
and
that
i
wished
to
help
him
in
any
practical
way
to
try
to
make
things
a
little
better
i
have
always
had
a
horror
of
words
that
are
not
translated
into
deeds
of
speech
that
does
not
result
in
action
in
other
words
i
believe
in
realizable
ideals
and
in
realizing
them
in
preaching
what
can
be
practiced
and
then
in
practicing
it
jacob
riis
had
drawn
an
indictment
of
the
things
that
were
wrong
pitifully
and
dreadfully
wrong
with
the
tenement
homes
and
the
tenement
lives
of
our
in
his
book
he
had
pointed
out
how
the
city
government
and
especially
those
connected
with
the
departments
of
police
and
health
could
aid
in
remedying
some
of
the
wrongs
as
president
of
the
police
board
i
was
also
a
member
of
the
health
board
in
both
positions
i
felt
that
with
jacob
riis
guidance
i
would
be
able
to
put
a
goodly
number
of
his
principles
into
actual
effect
he
and
i
looked
at
life
and
its
problems
from
substantially
the
same
standpoint
our
ideals
and
principles
and
purposes
and
our
beliefs
as
to
the
methods
necessary
to
realize
them
were
alike
after
the
election
in
i
had
written
him
a
letter
which
ran
in
part
as
follows
it
is
very
important
to
the
city
to
have
a
business
man
mayor
but
it
is
more
important
to
have
a
workingman
mayor
and
i
want
strong
to
be
that
also
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
rapid
transit
but
it
is
a
good
deal
more
important
if
you
look
at
matters
with
a
proper
perspective
to
have
ample
playgrounds
in
the
poorer
quarters
of
the
city
and
to
take
the
children
off
the
streets
so
as
to
prevent
them
growing
up
toughs
in
the
same
way
it
is
an
admirable
thing
to
have
clean
streets
indeed
it
is
an
essential
thing
to
have
them
but
it
would
be
a
better
thing
to
have
our
schools
large
enough
to
give
ample
accommodation
to
all
who
should
be
pupils
and
to
provide
them
with
proper
playgrounds
and
i
added
while
expressing
my
regret
that
i
had
not
been
able
to
accept
the
commissionership
that
i
would
have
been
delighted
to
smash
up
the
corrupt
contractors
and
put
the
force
absolutely
out
of
the
domain
of
politics
this
was
nineteen
years
ago
but
it
makes
a
pretty
good
platform
in
municipal
politics
even
smash
corruption
take
the
municipal
service
out
of
the
domain
of
politics
insist
upon
having
a
mayor
who
shall
be
a
workingman
mayor
even
more
than
a
business
man
mayor
and
devote
all
attention
possible
to
the
welfare
of
the
children
therefore
as
i
viewed
it
there
were
two
sides
to
the
work
first
the
actual
handling
of
the
police
department
second
using
my
position
to
help
in
making
the
city
a
better
place
in
which
to
live
and
work
for
those
to
whom
the
conditions
of
life
and
labor
were
hardest
the
two
problems
were
closely
connected
for
one
thing
never
to
be
forgotten
in
striving
to
better
the
conditions
of
the
new
york
police
force
is
the
connection
between
the
standard
of
morals
and
behavior
in
that
force
and
the
general
standard
of
morals
and
behavior
in
the
city
at
large
the
form
of
government
of
the
police
department
at
that
time
was
such
as
to
make
it
a
matter
of
extreme
difficulty
to
get
good
results
it
represented
that
device
of
american
political
thought
the
desire
to
establish
checks
and
balances
so
elaborate
that
no
man
shall
have
power
enough
to
do
anything
very
bad
in
practice
this
always
means
that
no
man
has
power
enough
to
do
anything
good
and
that
what
is
bad
is
done
anyhow
in
most
positions
the
division
of
powers
theory
works
unmitigated
mischief
the
only
way
to
get
good
service
is
to
give
somebody
power
to
render
it
facing
the
fact
that
power
which
will
enable
a
man
to
do
a
job
well
will
also
necessarily
enable
him
to
do
it
ill
if
he
is
the
wrong
kind
of
man
what
is
normally
needed
is
the
concentration
in
the
hands
of
one
man
or
of
a
very
small
body
of
men
of
ample
power
to
enable
him
or
them
to
do
the
work
that
is
necessary
and
then
the
devising
of
means
to
hold
these
men
fully
responsible
for
the
exercise
of
that
power
by
the
people
this
of
course
means
that
if
the
people
are
willing
to
see
power
misused
it
will
be
misused
but
it
also
means
that
if
as
we
hold
the
people
are
fit
for
if
in
other
words
our
talk
and
our
institutions
are
not
shams
we
will
get
good
government
i
do
not
contend
that
my
theory
will
automatically
bring
good
government
i
do
contend
that
it
will
enable
us
to
get
as
good
government
as
we
deserve
and
that
the
other
way
will
not
the
then
government
of
the
police
department
was
so
devised
as
to
render
it
most
difficult
to
accomplish
anything
good
while
the
field
for
intrigue
and
conspiracy
was
limitless
there
were
four
commissioners
two
supposed
to
belong
to
one
party
and
two
to
the
other
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
never
divided
on
party
lines
there
was
a
chief
appointed
by
the
commissioners
but
whom
they
could
not
remove
without
a
regular
trial
subject
to
review
by
the
courts
of
law
this
chief
and
any
one
commissioner
had
power
to
hold
up
most
of
the
acts
of
the
other
three
commissioners
it
was
made
easy
for
the
four
commissioners
to
come
to
a
deadlock
among
themselves
and
if
this
danger
was
avoided
it
was
easy
for
one
commissioner
by
intriguing
with
the
chief
to
bring
the
other
three
to
a
standstill
the
commissioners
were
appointed
by
the
mayor
but
he
could
not
remove
them
without
the
assent
of
the
governor
who
was
usually
politically
opposed
to
him
in
the
same
way
the
commissioners
could
appoint
the
patrolmen
but
they
could
not
remove
them
save
after
a
trial
which
went
up
for
review
to
the
courts
as
was
inevitable
under
our
system
of
law
procedure
this
meant
that
the
action
of
the
court
was
apt
to
be
determined
by
legal
technicalities
it
was
possible
to
dismiss
a
man
from
the
service
for
quite
insufficient
reasons
and
to
provide
against
the
reversal
of
the
sentence
if
the
technicalities
of
procedure
were
observed
but
the
worst
criminals
were
apt
to
be
adroit
men
against
whom
it
was
impossible
to
get
legal
evidence
which
a
court
could
properly
consider
in
a
criminal
trial
and
the
mood
of
the
court
might
be
to
treat
the
case
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
trial
although
it
was
easy
to
get
evidence
which
would
render
it
not
merely
justifiable
but
necessary
for
a
man
to
remove
them
from
his
private
employ
and
surely
the
public
should
be
as
well
treated
as
a
private
employer
accordingly
most
of
the
worst
men
put
out
were
reinstated
by
the
courts
and
when
the
mayor
attempted
to
remove
one
of
my
colleagues
who
made
it
his
business
to
try
to
nullify
the
work
done
by
the
rest
of
us
the
governor
sided
with
the
recalcitrant
commissioner
and
refused
to
permit
his
removal
nevertheless
an
astounding
quantity
of
work
was
done
in
reforming
the
force
we
had
a
good
deal
of
power
anyhow
we
exercised
it
to
the
full
and
we
accomplished
some
things
by
assuming
the
appearance
of
a
power
which
we
did
not
really
possess
the
first
fight
i
made
was
to
keep
politics
absolutely
out
of
the
force
and
not
only
politics
but
every
kind
of
improper
favoritism
doubtless
in
making
thousands
of
appointments
and
hundreds
of
promotions
there
were
men
who
contrived
to
use
influence
of
which
i
was
ignorant
but
these
cases
must
have
been
few
and
far
between
as
far
as
was
humanly
possible
the
appointments
and
promotions
were
made
without
regard
to
any
question
except
the
fitness
of
the
man
and
the
needs
of
the
service
as
civil
service
commissioner
i
had
been
instructing
heads
of
departments
and
bureaus
how
to
get
men
appointed
without
regard
to
politics
and
assuring
them
that
by
following
our
methods
they
would
obtain
results
as
police
commissioner
i
was
able
practically
to
apply
my
own
teachings
the
appointments
to
the
police
force
were
made
as
i
have
described
in
the
last
chapter
we
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
a
politics
or
creed
or
where
he
was
born
so
long
as
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
on
an
average
we
obtained
far
and
away
the
best
men
that
had
ever
come
into
the
police
department
it
was
of
course
very
difficult
at
first
to
convince
both
the
politicians
and
the
people
that
we
really
meant
what
we
said
and
that
every
one
really
would
have
a
fair
trial
there
had
been
in
previous
years
the
most
widespread
and
gross
corruption
in
connection
with
every
activity
in
the
police
department
and
there
had
been
a
regular
tariff
for
appointments
and
promotions
many
powerful
politicians
and
many
corrupt
outsiders
believed
that
in
some
way
or
other
it
would
still
be
possible
to
secure
appointments
by
corrupt
and
improper
methods
and
many
good
citizens
felt
the
same
conviction
i
endeavored
to
remove
the
impression
from
the
minds
of
both
sets
of
people
by
giving
the
widest
publicity
to
what
we
were
doing
and
how
we
were
doing
it
by
making
the
whole
process
open
and
aboveboard
and
by
making
it
evident
that
we
would
probe
to
the
bottom
every
charge
of
corruption
for
instance
i
received
visits
at
one
time
from
a
catholic
priest
and
at
another
time
from
a
methodist
clergyman
who
had
parishioners
who
wished
to
enter
the
police
force
but
who
did
not
believe
they
could
get
in
save
by
the
payment
of
money
or
through
political
pressure
the
priest
was
running
a
temperance
lyceum
in
connection
with
his
church
and
he
wished
to
know
if
there
would
be
a
chance
for
some
of
the
young
men
who
belonged
to
that
lyceum
the
methodist
clergyman
came
from
a
little
patch
of
old
native
america
which
by
a
recent
extension
had
been
taken
within
the
limits
of
the
huge
polyglot
city
his
was
a
small
church
most
of
the
members
being
shipwrights
mechanics
and
sailormen
from
the
local
coasters
in
each
case
i
assured
my
visitor
that
we
wanted
on
the
force
men
of
the
exact
type
which
he
said
he
could
furnish
i
also
told
him
that
i
was
as
anxious
as
he
was
to
find
out
if
there
was
any
improper
work
being
done
in
connection
with
the
examinations
and
that
i
would
like
him
to
get
four
or
five
of
his
men
to
take
the
examinations
without
letting
me
know
their
names
then
whether
the
men
failed
or
succeeded
he
and
i
would
take
their
papers
and
follow
them
through
every
stage
so
that
we
could
tell
at
once
whether
they
had
been
either
improperly
favored
or
improperly
discriminated
against
this
was
accordingly
done
and
in
each
case
my
visitor
turned
up
a
few
weeks
later
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
to
say
that
his
candidates
had
passed
and
that
everything
was
evidently
all
straight
during
my
two
years
as
president
of
the
commission
i
think
i
appointed
a
dozen
or
fifteen
members
of
that
little
methodist
congregation
and
certainly
twice
that
number
of
men
from
the
temperance
lyceum
of
the
catholic
church
in
question
they
were
all
men
of
the
very
type
i
most
wished
to
see
on
the
force
men
of
strong
physique
and
resolute
temper
sober
with
a
strong
wish
to
improve
themselves
occasionally
i
would
myself
pick
out
a
man
and
tell
him
to
take
the
examination
thus
one
evening
i
went
down
to
speak
in
the
bowery
at
the
young
men
institute
a
branch
of
the
young
men
christian
association
at
the
request
of
cleveland
dodge
while
there
he
told
me
he
wished
to
show
me
a
young
jew
who
had
recently
by
an
exhibition
of
marked
pluck
and
bodily
prowess
saved
some
women
and
children
from
a
burning
building
the
young
jew
whose
name
was
otto
raphael
was
brought
up
to
see
me
a
powerful
fellow
with
a
intelligent
face
i
asked
him
about
his
education
and
told
him
to
try
the
examination
he
did
passed
was
appointed
and
made
an
admirable
officer
and
he
and
all
his
family
wherever
they
may
dwell
have
been
close
friends
of
mine
ever
since
otto
raphael
was
a
genuine
east
sider
he
and
i
were
both
straight
new
york
to
use
the
vernacular
of
our
native
city
to
show
our
community
of
feeling
and
our
grasp
of
the
facts
of
life
i
may
mention
that
we
were
almost
the
only
men
in
the
police
department
who
picked
fitzsimmons
as
a
winner
against
corbett
otto
parents
had
come
over
from
russia
and
not
only
in
social
standing
but
in
pay
a
policeman
position
meant
everything
to
him
it
enabled
otto
to
educate
his
little
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
been
born
in
this
country
and
to
bring
over
from
russia
two
or
three
kinsfolk
who
had
perforce
been
left
behind
rather
curiously
it
was
by
no
means
as
easy
to
keep
politics
and
corruption
out
of
the
promotions
as
out
of
the
entrance
examinations
this
was
because
i
could
take
complete
charge
of
the
entrance
examinations
myself
and
moreover
they
were
largely
automatic
in
promotions
on
the
other
hand
the
prime
element
was
the
record
and
capacity
of
the
officer
and
for
this
we
had
largely
to
rely
upon
the
judgment
of
the
man
immediate
superiors
this
doubtless
meant
that
in
certain
cases
that
judgment
was
given
for
improper
reasons
however
there
were
cases
where
i
could
act
on
personal
knowledge
one
thing
that
we
did
was
to
endeavor
to
recognize
gallantry
we
did
not
have
to
work
a
revolution
in
the
force
as
to
courage
in
the
way
that
we
had
to
work
a
revolution
in
honesty
they
had
always
been
brave
in
dealing
with
riotous
and
violent
criminals
but
they
had
gradually
become
very
corrupt
our
great
work
therefore
was
the
stamping
out
of
dishonesty
and
this
work
we
did
thoroughly
so
far
as
the
ridiculous
law
under
which
the
department
was
administered
would
permit
but
we
were
anxious
that
while
stamping
out
what
was
evil
in
the
force
we
should
keep
and
improve
what
was
good
while
warring
on
dishonesty
we
made
every
effort
to
increase
efficiency
it
has
unfortunately
been
shown
by
sad
experience
that
at
times
a
police
organization
which
is
free
from
the
taint
of
corruption
may
yet
show
itself
weak
in
some
great
crisis
or
unable
to
deal
with
the
more
dangerous
kinds
of
criminals
this
we
were
determined
to
prevent
our
efforts
were
crowned
with
entire
success
the
improvement
in
the
efficiency
of
the
force
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
improvement
in
its
honesty
the
men
in
uniform
and
the
men
in
plain
clothes
the
detectives
did
better
work
than
ever
before
the
aggregate
of
crimes
where
punishment
followed
the
commission
of
the
crime
increased
while
the
aggregate
of
crimes
where
the
criminal
escaped
punishment
decreased
every
discredited
politician
every
sensational
newspaper
and
every
timid
fool
who
could
be
scared
by
clamor
was
against
us
all
three
classes
strove
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
show
that
in
making
the
force
honest
we
had
impaired
its
efficiency
and
by
their
utterances
they
tended
to
bring
about
the
very
condition
of
things
against
which
they
professed
to
protest
but
we
went
steadily
along
the
path
we
had
marked
out
the
fight
was
hard
and
there
was
plenty
of
worry
and
anxiety
but
we
won
i
was
appointed
in
may
in
february
three
months
before
i
resigned
to
become
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
the
judge
who
charged
the
grand
jury
of
new
york
county
was
able
to
congratulate
them
on
the
phenomenal
decrease
in
crime
especially
of
the
violent
sort
this
decrease
was
steady
during
the
two
years
the
police
after
the
reform
policy
was
thoroughly
tried
proved
more
successful
than
ever
before
in
protecting
life
and
property
and
in
putting
down
crime
and
criminal
vice
the
part
played
by
the
recognition
and
reward
of
actual
personal
prowess
among
the
members
of
the
police
force
in
producing
this
state
of
affairs
was
appreciable
though
there
were
many
other
factors
that
combined
to
bring
about
the
betterment
the
immense
improvement
in
discipline
by
punishing
all
offenders
without
mercy
no
matter
how
great
their
political
or
personal
influence
the
resolute
warfare
against
every
kind
of
criminal
who
had
hitherto
been
able
corruptly
to
purchase
protection
the
prompt
recognition
of
ability
even
where
it
was
entirely
unconnected
with
personal
prowess
all
these
were
elements
which
had
enormous
weight
in
producing
the
change
mere
courage
and
daring
and
the
rewarding
of
courage
and
daring
can
not
supply
the
lack
of
discipline
of
ability
of
honesty
but
they
are
of
vital
consequence
nevertheless
no
police
force
is
worth
anything
if
its
members
are
not
intelligent
and
honest
but
neither
is
it
worth
anything
unless
its
members
are
brave
hardy
and
well
disciplined
we
showed
recognition
of
daring
and
of
personal
prowess
in
two
ways
first
by
awarding
a
medal
or
a
certificate
in
remembrance
of
the
deed
and
second
by
giving
it
weight
in
making
any
promotion
especially
to
the
lower
grades
in
the
higher
grades
in
all
promotions
above
that
of
sergeant
for
instance
resolute
and
daring
courage
can
not
normally
be
considered
as
a
factor
of
determining
weight
in
making
promotions
rather
is
it
a
quality
the
lack
of
which
unfits
a
man
for
promotion
for
in
the
higher
places
we
must
assume
the
existence
of
such
a
quality
in
any
fit
candidate
and
must
make
the
promotion
with
a
view
to
the
energy
executive
capacity
and
power
of
command
in
the
lower
grades
however
marked
gallantry
should
always
be
taken
into
account
in
deciding
among
different
candidates
for
any
given
place
during
our
two
years
service
we
found
it
necessary
over
a
hundred
times
to
single
out
men
for
special
mention
because
of
some
feat
of
heroism
the
heroism
usually
took
one
of
four
forms
saving
somebody
from
drowning
saving
somebody
from
a
burning
building
stopping
a
runaway
team
or
arresting
some
violent
lawbreaker
under
exceptional
circumstances
to
illustrate
our
method
of
action
i
will
take
two
of
the
first
promotions
made
after
i
became
commissioner
one
case
was
that
of
an
old
fellow
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
who
was
at
the
time
a
roundsman
i
happened
to
notice
one
day
that
he
had
saved
a
woman
from
drowning
and
had
him
summoned
so
that
i
might
look
into
the
matter
the
old
fellow
brought
up
his
record
before
me
and
showed
not
a
little
nervousness
and
agitation
for
it
appeared
that
he
had
grown
gray
in
the
service
had
performed
feat
after
feat
of
heroism
but
had
no
political
backing
of
any
account
no
heed
had
ever
been
paid
him
he
was
one
of
the
quiet
men
who
attend
solely
to
duty
and
although
a
grand
army
man
he
had
never
sought
to
use
influence
of
any
kind
now
at
last
he
thought
there
was
a
chance
for
him
he
had
been
years
on
the
force
and
during
that
time
had
saved
some
persons
from
death
by
drowning
varying
the
performance
two
or
three
times
by
saving
persons
from
burning
buildings
twice
congress
had
passed
laws
especially
to
empower
the
then
secretary
of
the
treasury
john
sherman
to
give
him
a
medal
for
distinguished
gallantry
in
saving
life
the
society
had
also
given
him
its
medal
and
so
had
the
police
department
there
was
not
a
complaint
in
all
his
record
against
him
for
any
infraction
of
duty
and
he
was
sober
and
trustworthy
he
was
entitled
to
his
promotion
and
he
got
it
there
and
then
it
may
be
worth
mentioning
that
he
kept
on
saving
life
after
he
was
given
his
sergeantcy
on
october
he
again
rescued
a
man
from
drowning
it
was
at
night
nobody
else
was
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
dock
from
which
he
jumped
was
in
absolute
darkness
and
he
was
ten
minutes
in
the
water
which
was
very
cold
he
was
years
old
when
he
saved
this
man
it
was
the
person
whose
life
he
had
saved
during
his
years
service
in
the
department
the
other
man
was
a
patrolman
whom
we
promoted
to
roundsman
for
activity
in
catching
a
burglar
under
rather
peculiar
circumstances
i
happened
to
note
his
getting
a
burglar
one
week
apparently
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
for
he
got
another
next
week
in
the
latter
case
the
burglar
escaped
from
the
house
soon
after
midnight
and
ran
away
toward
park
avenue
with
the
policeman
in
hot
chase
the
new
york
central
railroad
runs
under
park
avenue
and
there
is
a
succession
of
openings
in
the
top
of
the
tunnel
finding
that
the
policeman
was
gaining
on
him
the
burglar
took
a
desperate
chance
and
leaped
down
one
of
these
openings
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
now
the
burglar
was
running
for
his
liberty
and
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
for
him
to
imperil
life
or
limb
but
the
policeman
was
merely
doing
his
duty
and
nobody
could
have
blamed
him
for
not
taking
the
jump
however
he
jumped
and
in
this
particular
case
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
heavy
upon
the
unrighteous
the
burglar
had
the
breath
knocked
out
of
him
and
the
cop
did
when
his
victim
could
walk
the
officer
trotted
him
around
to
the
and
a
week
after
i
had
the
officer
up
and
promoted
him
for
he
was
sober
trustworthy
and
strictly
attentive
to
duty
now
i
think
that
any
decent
man
of
reasonable
intelligence
will
agree
that
we
were
quite
right
in
promoting
men
in
cases
like
these
and
quite
right
in
excluding
politics
from
promotions
yet
it
was
because
of
our
consistently
acting
in
this
manner
resolutely
warring
on
dishonesty
and
on
that
peculiar
form
of
baseness
which
masquerades
as
practical
politics
and
steadily
refusing
to
pay
heed
to
any
consideration
except
the
good
of
the
service
and
the
city
and
the
merits
of
the
men
themselves
that
we
drew
down
upon
our
heads
the
bitter
and
malignant
animosity
of
the
spoils
politicians
they
secured
the
repeal
of
the
civil
service
law
by
the
state
legislature
they
attempted
and
almost
succeeded
in
the
effort
to
legislate
us
out
of
office
they
joined
with
the
baser
portion
of
the
sensational
press
in
every
species
of
foul
indecent
falsehood
and
slander
as
to
what
we
were
doing
they
attempted
to
seduce
or
frighten
us
by
every
species
of
intrigue
and
cajolery
of
promise
of
political
reward
and
threat
of
political
punishment
they
failed
in
their
purpose
i
believe
in
political
organizations
and
i
believe
in
practical
politics
if
a
man
is
not
practical
he
is
of
no
use
anywhere
but
when
politicians
treat
practical
politics
as
foul
politics
and
when
they
turn
what
ought
to
be
a
necessary
and
useful
political
organization
into
a
machine
run
by
professional
spoilsmen
of
low
morality
in
their
own
interest
then
it
is
time
to
drive
the
politician
from
public
life
and
either
to
mend
or
destroy
the
machine
according
as
the
necessity
may
determine
we
promoted
to
roundsman
a
patrolman
with
an
already
excellent
record
for
gallantry
shown
in
a
fray
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
his
antagonist
he
was
after
a
gang
of
toughs
who
had
just
waylaid
robbed
and
beaten
a
man
they
scattered
and
he
pursued
the
ringleader
running
hard
he
gained
on
his
man
whereupon
the
latter
suddenly
turned
and
fired
full
in
his
face
the
officer
already
had
his
revolver
drawn
and
the
two
shots
rang
out
almost
together
the
policeman
was
within
a
fraction
of
death
for
the
bullet
from
his
opponent
pistol
went
through
his
helmet
and
just
broke
the
skin
of
his
head
his
own
aim
was
truer
and
the
man
he
was
after
fell
dead
shot
through
the
heart
i
may
explain
that
i
have
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
any
policy
which
tends
to
put
the
policeman
at
the
mercy
of
a
tough
or
which
deprives
him
of
efficient
weapons
while
police
commissioner
we
punished
any
brutality
by
the
police
with
such
immediate
severity
that
all
cases
of
brutality
practically
came
to
an
end
no
decent
citizen
had
anything
to
fear
from
the
police
during
the
two
years
of
my
service
but
we
consistently
encouraged
the
police
to
prove
that
the
violent
criminal
who
endeavored
to
molest
them
or
to
resist
arrest
or
to
interfere
with
them
in
the
discharge
of
their
duty
was
himself
in
grave
jeopardy
and
we
had
every
gang
broken
up
and
the
members
punished
with
whatever
severity
was
necessary
of
course
where
possible
the
officer
merely
crippled
the
criminal
who
was
violent
one
of
the
things
that
we
did
while
in
office
was
to
train
the
men
in
the
use
of
the
pistol
a
school
of
pistol
practice
was
established
and
the
marksmanship
of
the
force
was
wonderfully
improved
the
man
in
charge
of
the
school
was
a
roundsman
petty
whom
we
promoted
to
sergeant
he
was
one
of
the
champion
revolver
shots
of
the
country
and
could
hit
just
about
where
he
aimed
twice
he
was
forced
to
fire
at
criminals
who
resisted
arrest
and
in
each
case
he
hit
his
man
in
the
arm
or
leg
simply
stopping
him
without
danger
to
his
life
in
may
a
number
of
burglaries
occurred
far
uptown
in
the
neighborhood
of
one
hundred
and
street
and
union
avenue
two
officers
were
sent
out
each
night
to
patrol
the
streets
in
plain
clothes
about
two
on
the
morning
of
may
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
men
loitering
about
a
large
corner
house
and
determined
to
make
them
explain
their
actions
in
order
to
cut
off
their
escape
one
officer
went
down
one
street
and
one
the
other
the
first
officer
whose
name
was
ryan
found
the
two
men
at
the
gateway
of
the
side
entrance
of
the
house
and
hailed
to
know
what
they
were
doing
without
answering
they
turned
and
ran
toward
prospect
avenue
with
ryan
in
close
pursuit
after
running
about
one
hundred
feet
one
of
them
turned
and
fired
three
shots
at
ryan
but
failed
to
hit
him
the
two
then
separated
and
the
man
who
had
done
the
shooting
escaped
the
other
man
whose
name
proved
to
be
again
took
to
his
heels
with
ryan
still
after
him
they
turned
the
corner
and
met
the
other
officer
whose
name
was
reid
running
as
hard
as
he
could
toward
the
shooting
when
saw
himself
cut
off
by
reid
he
fired
at
his
new
foe
the
bullet
cutting
reid
overcoat
on
the
left
shoulder
reid
promptly
fired
in
return
his
bullet
going
into
neck
and
causing
him
to
turn
a
complete
somersault
the
two
officers
then
cared
for
their
prisoner
until
the
ambulance
arrived
when
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
pronounced
mortally
wounded
his
companion
was
afterward
caught
and
they
turned
out
to
be
the
very
burglars
for
whom
reid
and
ryan
had
been
on
the
lookout
in
december
one
of
our
officers
was
shot
a
row
occurred
in
a
restaurant
which
ended
in
two
young
toughs
drawing
their
revolvers
and
literally
running
amuck
shooting
two
or
three
men
a
policeman
attracted
by
the
noise
ran
up
and
seized
one
of
them
whereupon
the
other
shot
him
in
the
mouth
wounding
him
badly
nevertheless
the
officer
kept
his
prisoner
and
carried
him
to
the
the
tough
who
had
done
the
shooting
ran
out
and
was
seized
by
another
officer
the
tough
fired
at
him
the
bullet
passing
through
the
officer
overcoat
but
he
was
promptly
knocked
down
disarmed
and
brought
to
the
in
this
case
neither
policeman
used
his
revolver
and
each
brought
in
his
man
although
the
latter
was
armed
and
resisted
arrest
one
of
the
officers
taking
in
his
prisoner
after
having
been
himself
severely
wounded
a
lamentable
feature
of
the
case
was
that
this
same
officer
was
a
man
who
though
capable
of
great
gallantry
was
also
given
to
shirking
his
work
and
we
were
finally
obliged
to
dismiss
him
from
the
force
after
passing
over
two
or
three
glaring
misdeeds
in
view
of
his
record
for
courage
we
promoted
another
man
on
account
of
finding
out
accidentally
that
he
had
performed
a
notable
feat
which
he
had
forborne
even
to
mention
so
that
his
name
never
came
on
the
roll
of
honor
late
at
night
while
patrolling
a
lonely
part
of
his
post
he
came
upon
three
young
toughs
who
had
turned
highwaymen
and
were
robbing
a
peddler
he
ran
in
at
once
with
his
whereupon
the
toughs
showed
fight
and
one
of
them
struck
at
him
with
a
bludgeon
breaking
his
left
hand
the
officer
however
made
such
good
use
of
his
that
he
knocked
down
two
of
his
assailants
whereupon
the
third
ran
away
and
he
brought
both
of
his
prisoners
to
the
then
he
went
round
to
the
hospital
had
his
broken
hand
set
in
plaster
and
actually
reported
for
duty
at
the
next
tour
without
losing
one
hour
he
was
a
quiet
fellow
with
a
record
free
from
complaints
and
we
made
him
roundsman
the
mounted
squad
have
of
course
many
opportunities
to
distinguish
themselves
in
stopping
runaways
in
may
a
mounted
policeman
named
heyer
succeeded
in
stopping
a
runaway
at
kingsbridge
under
rather
noteworthy
circumstances
two
men
were
driving
in
a
buggy
when
the
horse
stumbled
and
in
recovering
himself
broke
the
so
that
the
bridle
fell
off
the
horse
was
a
spirited
trotter
and
at
once
ran
away
at
full
speed
heyer
saw
the
occurrence
and
followed
at
a
run
when
he
got
alongside
the
runaway
he
seized
him
by
the
forelock
guided
him
dexterously
over
the
bridge
preventing
him
from
running
into
the
numerous
wagons
that
were
on
the
road
and
finally
forced
him
up
a
hill
and
into
a
three
months
later
this
same
officer
saved
a
man
from
drowning
the
members
of
the
bicycle
squad
which
was
established
shortly
after
we
took
office
soon
grew
to
show
not
only
extraordinary
proficiency
on
the
wheel
but
extraordinary
daring
they
frequently
stopped
runaways
wheeling
alongside
of
them
and
grasping
the
horses
while
going
at
full
speed
and
what
was
even
more
remarkable
they
managed
not
only
to
overtake
but
to
jump
into
the
vehicle
and
capture
on
two
or
three
different
occasions
men
who
were
guilty
of
reckless
driving
and
who
fought
violently
in
resisting
arrest
they
were
picked
men
being
young
and
active
and
any
feat
of
daring
which
could
be
accomplished
on
the
wheel
they
were
certain
to
accomplish
three
of
the
best
riders
of
the
bicycle
squad
whose
names
and
records
happen
to
occur
to
me
were
men
of
the
three
ethnic
strains
most
strongly
represented
in
the
new
york
police
force
being
respectively
of
native
american
german
and
irish
parentage
the
german
was
a
man
of
enormous
power
and
he
was
able
to
stop
each
of
the
many
runaways
he
tackled
without
losing
his
wheel
choosing
his
time
he
would
get
alongside
the
horse
and
seize
the
bit
in
his
left
hand
keeping
his
right
on
the
crossbar
of
the
wheel
by
degrees
he
then
got
the
animal
under
control
he
never
failed
to
stop
it
and
he
never
lost
his
wheel
he
also
never
failed
to
overtake
any
scorcher
although
many
of
these
were
professional
riders
who
deliberately
violated
the
law
to
see
if
they
could
not
get
away
from
him
for
the
wheelmen
soon
get
to
know
the
officers
whose
beats
they
cross
the
yankee
though
a
tall
powerful
man
and
a
very
good
rider
scarcely
came
up
to
the
german
in
either
respect
he
possessed
exceptional
ability
however
as
well
as
exceptional
nerve
and
coolness
and
he
also
won
his
promotion
he
stopped
about
as
many
runaways
but
when
the
horse
was
really
he
usually
had
to
turn
his
wheel
loose
getting
a
firm
grip
on
the
horse
reins
and
then
kicking
his
wheel
so
that
it
would
fall
out
of
the
way
of
injury
from
the
wagon
on
one
occasion
he
had
a
fight
with
a
drunken
and
reckless
driver
who
was
urging
to
top
speed
a
spirited
horse
he
first
got
hold
of
the
horse
whereupon
the
driver
lashed
both
him
and
the
beast
and
the
animal
already
mad
with
terror
could
not
be
stopped
the
officer
had
of
course
kicked
away
his
wheel
at
the
beginning
and
after
being
dragged
along
for
some
distance
he
let
go
the
beast
and
made
a
grab
at
the
wagon
the
driver
hit
him
with
his
whip
but
he
managed
to
get
in
and
after
a
vigorous
tussle
overcame
his
man
and
disposed
of
him
by
getting
him
down
and
sitting
on
him
this
left
his
hands
free
for
the
reins
by
degrees
he
got
the
horse
under
control
and
drove
the
wagon
round
to
the
still
sitting
on
his
victim
i
jounced
up
and
down
on
him
to
keep
him
quiet
when
he
turned
ugly
he
remarked
to
me
parenthetically
having
disposed
of
the
wagon
he
took
the
man
round
to
the
court
and
on
the
way
the
prisoner
suddenly
sprang
on
him
and
tried
to
throttle
him
convinced
at
last
that
patience
had
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
he
quieted
his
assailant
with
a
smash
on
the
head
that
took
all
the
fight
out
of
him
until
he
was
brought
before
the
judge
and
fined
like
the
other
bicycle
cops
this
officer
made
a
number
of
arrests
of
criminals
such
as
thieves
highwaymen
and
the
like
in
addition
to
his
natural
prey
scorchers
runaways
and
reckless
drivers
the
third
member
of
the
trio
a
tall
sinewy
man
with
flaming
red
hair
which
rather
added
to
the
terror
he
inspired
in
was
usually
stationed
in
a
tough
part
of
the
city
where
there
was
a
tendency
to
crimes
of
violence
and
incidentally
an
occasional
desire
to
harass
wheelmen
the
officer
was
as
good
off
his
wheel
as
on
it
and
he
speedily
established
perfect
order
on
his
beat
being
always
willing
to
take
chances
in
getting
his
man
he
was
no
respecter
of
persons
and
when
it
became
his
duty
to
arrest
a
wealthy
man
for
persistently
refusing
to
have
his
carriage
lamps
lighted
after
nightfall
he
brought
him
in
with
the
same
indifference
that
he
displayed
in
arresting
a
tough
who
had
thrown
a
brick
at
a
wheelman
occasionally
a
policeman
would
perform
work
which
ordinarily
comes
within
the
domain
of
the
fireman
in
november
an
officer
who
had
previously
saved
a
man
from
death
by
drowning
added
to
his
record
by
saving
five
persons
from
burning
he
was
at
the
time
asleep
when
he
was
aroused
by
a
fire
in
a
house
a
few
doors
away
running
over
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
houses
until
he
reached
the
burning
building
he
found
that
on
the
fourth
floor
the
flames
had
cut
off
all
exit
from
an
apartment
in
which
there
were
four
women
two
of
them
over
fifty
and
one
of
the
others
with
a
baby
the
officer
ran
down
to
the
adjoining
house
broke
open
the
door
of
the
apartment
on
the
same
floor
the
fourth
and
crept
out
on
the
coping
less
than
three
inches
wide
that
ran
from
one
house
to
the
other
being
a
large
and
very
powerful
and
active
man
he
managed
to
keep
hold
of
the
casing
of
the
window
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
to
reach
to
the
window
of
the
apartment
where
the
women
and
child
were
the
firemen
appeared
and
stretched
a
net
underneath
the
crowd
that
was
looking
on
suddenly
became
motionless
and
silent
then
one
by
one
he
drew
the
women
out
of
their
window
and
holding
them
tight
against
the
wall
passed
them
into
the
other
window
the
exertion
in
such
an
attitude
was
great
and
he
strained
himself
badly
but
he
possessed
a
practical
mind
and
as
soon
as
the
women
were
saved
he
began
a
prompt
investigation
of
the
cause
of
the
fire
and
arrested
two
men
whose
carelessness
as
was
afterward
proved
caused
it
now
and
then
a
man
though
a
brave
man
proved
to
be
slack
or
stupid
or
vicious
and
we
could
make
nothing
out
of
him
but
hardihood
and
courage
were
qualities
upon
which
we
insisted
and
which
we
rewarded
whenever
i
see
the
police
force
attacked
and
vilified
i
always
remember
my
association
with
it
the
cases
i
have
given
above
are
merely
instances
chosen
almost
at
random
among
hundreds
of
others
men
such
as
those
i
have
mentioned
have
the
right
stuff
in
them
if
they
go
wrong
the
trouble
is
with
the
system
and
therefore
with
us
the
citizens
for
permitting
the
system
to
go
unchanged
the
conditions
of
new
york
life
are
such
as
to
make
the
police
problem
therein
more
difficult
than
in
any
other
of
the
world
great
capitals
i
am
often
asked
if
policemen
are
honest
i
believe
that
the
great
majority
of
them
want
to
be
honest
and
will
be
honest
whenever
they
are
given
the
chance
the
new
york
police
force
is
a
body
thoroughly
representative
of
the
great
city
itself
as
i
have
said
above
the
predominant
ethnic
strains
in
it
are
first
the
men
of
irish
birth
or
parentage
and
following
these
the
native
americans
usually
from
the
country
districts
and
the
men
of
german
birth
or
parentage
there
are
also
jews
scandinavians
italians
slavs
and
men
of
other
nationalities
all
soon
become
welded
into
one
body
they
are
physically
a
fine
lot
moreover
their
instincts
are
right
they
are
game
they
are
alert
and
they
prefer
to
act
squarely
if
they
are
allowed
so
to
act
all
that
they
need
is
to
be
given
the
chance
to
prove
themselves
honest
brave
and
the
law
at
present
is
much
better
than
in
our
day
so
far
as
governing
the
force
is
concerned
there
is
now
a
single
commissioner
and
the
mayor
has
complete
power
over
him
the
mayor
through
his
commissioner
now
has
power
to
keep
the
police
force
on
a
good
level
of
conduct
if
with
resolution
and
common
sense
he
insists
on
absolute
honesty
within
the
force
and
at
the
same
time
heartily
supports
it
against
the
criminal
classes
to
weaken
the
force
in
its
dealings
with
gangs
and
toughs
and
criminals
generally
is
as
damaging
as
to
permit
dishonesty
and
moreover
works
towards
dishonesty
but
while
under
the
present
law
very
much
improvement
can
be
worked
there
is
need
of
change
of
the
law
which
will
make
the
police
commissioner
a
permanent
official
holding
office
so
long
as
he
proves
thoroughly
fit
for
the
job
completely
independent
of
the
politicians
and
privileged
interests
and
with
complete
power
over
the
force
this
means
that
there
must
be
the
right
law
and
the
right
public
opinion
back
of
the
law
the
ethnic
character
of
the
force
now
and
then
gives
rise
to
or
affords
opportunity
for
queer
happenings
occasionally
it
enables
one
to
meet
emergencies
in
the
best
possible
fashion
while
i
was
police
commissioner
an
preacher
from
berlin
rector
ahlwardt
came
over
to
new
york
to
preach
a
crusade
against
the
jews
many
of
the
new
york
jews
were
much
excited
and
asked
me
to
prevent
him
from
speaking
and
not
to
give
him
police
protection
this
i
told
them
was
impossible
and
if
possible
would
have
been
undesirable
because
it
would
have
made
him
a
martyr
the
proper
thing
to
do
was
to
make
him
ridiculous
accordingly
i
detailed
for
his
protection
a
jew
sergeant
and
a
score
or
two
of
jew
policemen
he
made
his
harangue
against
the
jews
under
the
active
protection
of
some
forty
policemen
every
one
of
them
a
jew
it
was
the
most
effective
possible
answer
and
incidentally
it
was
an
to
our
people
whose
greatest
need
it
is
to
learn
that
there
must
be
no
division
by
class
hatred
whether
this
hatred
be
that
of
creed
against
creed
nationality
against
nationality
section
against
section
or
men
of
one
social
or
industrial
condition
against
men
of
another
social
and
industrial
condition
we
must
ever
judge
each
individual
on
his
own
conduct
and
merits
and
not
on
his
membership
in
any
class
whether
that
class
be
based
on
theological
social
or
industrial
considerations
among
my
political
opponents
when
i
was
police
commissioner
was
the
head
of
a
very
influential
local
democratic
organization
he
was
a
state
senator
usually
known
as
big
tim
sullivan
big
tim
represented
the
morals
of
another
era
that
is
his
principles
and
actions
were
very
much
those
of
a
norman
noble
in
the
years
immediately
succeeding
the
battle
of
hastings
this
will
seem
flattery
only
to
those
who
are
not
acquainted
with
the
real
histories
and
antecedents
of
the
norman
nobles
of
the
epoch
in
question
his
application
of
these
theories
to
our
municipal
democratic
conditions
brought
him
into
sharp
contact
with
me
and
with
one
of
my
men
in
the
department
inspector
john
mccullough
under
the
old
dispensation
this
would
have
meant
that
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
were
under
the
ban
now
it
happened
that
in
the
department
at
that
time
there
was
a
nephew
or
cousin
of
his
jerry
sullivan
i
found
that
jerry
was
an
uncommonly
good
man
a
conscientious
capable
officer
and
i
promoted
him
i
do
not
know
whether
jerry
or
jerry
cousin
senator
sullivan
was
more
astonished
the
senator
called
upon
me
to
express
what
i
am
sure
was
a
very
genuine
feeling
of
appreciation
poor
jerry
died
i
think
of
consumption
a
year
or
two
after
i
left
the
department
he
was
promoted
again
after
i
left
and
he
then
showed
that
he
possessed
the
very
rare
quality
of
gratitude
for
he
sent
me
a
telegram
dated
january
running
as
follows
was
made
sergeant
i
thank
you
for
all
in
my
first
advancement
and
in
a
letter
written
to
me
he
said
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
i
will
endeavor
at
all
times
to
perform
my
duty
honestly
and
fearlessly
and
never
cause
you
to
feel
that
you
were
mistaken
in
me
so
that
you
will
be
justly
proud
of
my
record
the
senator
though
politically
opposed
to
me
always
kept
a
feeling
of
friendship
for
me
after
this
incident
he
served
in
congress
while
i
was
president
the
police
can
be
used
to
help
all
kinds
of
good
purposes
when
i
was
police
commissioner
much
difficulty
had
been
encountered
in
locating
illegal
and
fraudulent
practitioners
of
medicine
maurice
lewi
called
on
me
with
a
letter
from
james
russell
parsons
the
secretary
of
the
board
of
regents
at
albany
and
asked
me
if
i
could
not
help
after
questioning
him
i
found
that
the
local
authorities
were
eager
to
prosecute
these
men
but
could
not
locate
them
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
try
my
hand
at
it
accordingly
a
sealed
order
was
sent
to
the
commanding
officer
of
each
police
precinct
in
new
york
not
to
be
opened
until
just
before
the
morning
roll
call
previous
to
the
police
squad
going
on
duty
this
order
required
that
immediately
upon
reaching
post
each
patrolman
should
go
over
his
beat
and
enter
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
provided
for
that
purpose
the
full
name
and
address
of
every
doctor
sign
there
appearing
immediately
upon
securing
this
information
the
patrolman
was
instructed
to
return
the
sheet
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
precinct
the
latter
in
turn
was
instructed
to
collect
and
place
in
one
large
envelope
and
to
return
to
police
headquarters
all
the
data
thus
received
as
a
result
of
this
procedure
within
two
hours
the
prosecuting
officials
of
the
city
of
new
york
were
in
possession
of
the
name
and
address
of
every
person
in
new
york
who
announced
himself
as
a
physician
and
scores
of
pretended
physicians
were
brought
to
book
or
driven
from
the
city
one
of
the
perennially
serious
and
difficult
problems
and
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
police
blackmail
and
corruption
is
to
be
found
in
the
excise
situation
in
new
york
when
i
was
police
commissioner
new
york
was
a
city
with
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
saloons
with
a
state
law
which
said
they
should
be
closed
on
sundays
and
with
a
local
sentiment
which
put
a
premium
on
violating
the
law
by
making
sunday
the
most
profitable
day
in
the
week
to
the
who
was
willing
to
take
chances
it
was
this
willingness
to
take
chances
that
furnished
to
the
corrupt
politician
and
the
corrupt
police
officer
their
opportunities
there
was
in
new
york
city
a
strong
sentiment
in
favor
of
honesty
in
politics
there
was
also
a
strong
sentiment
in
favor
of
opening
the
saloons
on
sundays
and
finally
there
was
a
strong
sentiment
in
favor
of
keeping
the
saloons
closed
on
sunday
unfortunately
many
of
the
men
who
favored
honest
government
nevertheless
preferred
keeping
the
saloons
open
to
having
honest
government
and
many
others
among
the
men
who
favored
honest
government
put
it
second
to
keeping
the
saloons
closed
moreover
among
the
people
who
wished
the
law
obeyed
and
the
saloons
closed
there
were
plenty
who
objected
strongly
to
every
step
necessary
to
accomplish
the
result
although
they
also
insisted
that
the
result
should
be
accomplished
meanwhile
the
politicians
found
an
incredible
profit
in
using
the
law
as
a
club
to
keep
the
saloons
in
line
all
except
the
biggest
the
owners
of
which
or
the
owners
of
the
breweries
back
of
which
sat
in
the
inner
councils
of
tammany
or
controlled
tammany
allies
in
the
republican
organization
the
police
used
the
partial
and
spasmodic
enforcement
of
the
law
as
a
means
of
collecting
blackmail
the
result
was
that
the
officers
of
the
law
the
politicians
and
the
became
inextricably
tangled
in
a
network
of
crime
and
connivance
at
crime
the
most
powerful
controlled
the
politicians
and
the
police
while
the
latter
in
turn
terrorized
and
blackmailed
all
the
other
it
was
not
a
case
of
of
the
law
the
law
was
very
actively
enforced
but
it
was
enforced
with
corrupt
discrimination
it
is
difficult
for
men
who
have
not
been
brought
into
contact
with
that
side
of
political
life
which
deals
with
the
underworld
to
understand
the
brazen
openness
with
which
this
blackmailing
of
lawbreakers
was
carried
out
a
further
very
dark
fact
was
that
many
of
the
men
responsible
for
putting
the
law
on
the
in
order
to
please
one
element
of
their
constituents
also
connived
at
or
even
profited
by
the
corrupt
and
partial
of
the
law
in
order
to
please
another
set
of
their
constituents
or
to
secure
profit
for
themselves
the
organ
of
the
at
that
time
was
the
wine
and
spirit
gazette
the
editor
of
this
paper
believed
in
selling
liquor
on
sunday
and
felt
that
it
was
an
outrage
to
forbid
it
but
he
also
felt
that
corruption
and
blackmail
made
too
big
a
price
to
pay
for
the
partial
of
the
law
he
made
in
his
paper
a
statement
the
correctness
of
which
was
never
questioned
which
offers
a
startling
commentary
on
new
york
politics
of
that
period
in
this
statement
he
recited
the
fact
that
the
system
of
blackmail
had
been
brought
to
such
a
state
of
perfection
and
had
become
so
oppressive
to
the
liquor
dealers
themselves
that
they
communicated
at
length
on
the
subject
with
governor
hill
the
state
democratic
boss
and
then
with
croker
the
city
democratic
boss
finally
the
matter
was
formally
taken
up
by
a
committee
of
the
central
association
of
liquor
dealers
in
an
interview
they
held
with
martin
my
tammany
predecessor
as
president
of
the
police
force
in
way
the
editor
statement
continues
an
agreement
was
made
between
the
leaders
of
tammany
hall
and
the
liquor
dealers
according
to
which
the
monthly
blackmail
paid
to
the
force
should
be
discontinued
in
return
for
political
support
not
only
did
the
big
bosses
state
and
local
treat
this
agreement
and
the
corruption
to
which
it
was
due
as
normal
and
proper
but
they
never
even
took
the
trouble
to
deny
what
had
been
done
when
it
was
made
public
tammany
and
the
police
however
did
not
fully
live
up
to
the
agreement
and
much
discrimination
of
a
very
corrupt
kind
and
of
a
very
exasperating
kind
to
who
wished
to
be
honest
continued
in
connection
with
the
enforcing
of
the
law
in
short
the
agreement
was
kept
only
with
those
who
had
pull
these
men
with
pull
were
benefited
when
their
rivals
were
bullied
and
blackmailed
by
the
police
the
police
meanwhile
who
had
bought
appointment
or
promotion
and
the
politicians
back
of
them
extended
the
blackmailing
to
include
about
everything
from
the
pushcart
peddler
and
the
big
or
small
merchant
who
wished
to
use
the
sidewalk
illegally
for
his
goods
up
to
the
keepers
of
the
brothel
the
and
the
the
total
blackmail
ran
into
millions
of
dollars
new
york
was
a
town
the
big
bosses
rolled
in
wealth
and
the
corrupt
policemen
who
ran
the
force
lost
all
sense
of
decency
and
justice
nevertheless
i
wish
to
insist
on
the
fact
that
the
honest
men
on
the
patrol
posts
the
men
with
the
remained
desirous
to
see
honesty
obtain
although
they
were
losing
courage
and
hope
this
was
the
situation
that
confronted
me
when
i
came
to
mulberry
street
the
saloon
was
the
chief
source
of
mischief
it
was
with
the
saloon
that
i
had
to
deal
and
there
was
only
one
way
to
deal
with
it
that
was
to
enforce
the
law
the
howl
that
rose
was
deafening
the
professional
politicians
raved
the
yellow
press
surpassed
themselves
in
clamor
and
mendacity
a
favorite
assertion
was
that
i
was
enforcing
a
blue
law
an
obsolete
law
that
had
never
before
been
enforced
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
only
enforcing
honestly
a
law
that
had
hitherto
been
enforced
dishonestly
there
was
very
little
increase
in
the
number
of
arrests
made
for
violating
the
sunday
law
indeed
there
were
weeks
when
the
number
of
arrests
went
down
the
only
difference
was
that
there
was
no
protected
class
everybody
was
arrested
alike
and
i
took
especial
pains
to
see
that
there
was
no
discrimination
and
that
the
big
men
and
the
men
with
political
influence
were
treated
like
every
one
else
the
immediate
effect
was
wholly
good
i
had
been
told
that
it
was
not
possible
to
close
the
saloons
on
sunday
and
that
i
could
not
succeed
however
i
did
succeed
the
warden
of
bellevue
hospital
reported
two
or
three
weeks
after
we
had
begun
that
for
the
first
time
in
its
existence
there
had
not
been
a
case
due
to
a
drunken
brawl
in
the
hospital
all
monday
the
police
courts
gave
the
same
testimony
while
savings
banks
recorded
increased
deposits
and
pawnshops
hard
times
the
most
touching
of
all
things
was
the
fact
that
we
received
letters
literally
by
the
hundred
from
mothers
in
who
had
never
been
allowed
to
take
their
children
to
the
country
in
the
days
and
who
now
found
their
husbands
willing
to
take
them
and
their
families
for
an
outing
on
sunday
jake
riis
and
i
spent
one
sunday
from
morning
till
night
in
the
tenement
districts
seeing
for
ourselves
what
had
happened
during
the
two
years
that
we
were
in
office
things
never
slipped
back
to
anything
like
what
they
had
been
before
but
we
did
not
succeed
in
keeping
them
quite
as
highly
keyed
as
during
these
first
weeks
as
regards
the
law
this
was
partly
because
public
sentiment
was
not
really
with
us
the
people
who
had
demanded
honesty
but
who
did
not
like
to
pay
for
it
by
the
loss
of
illegal
pleasure
joined
the
openly
dishonest
in
attacking
us
moreover
all
kinds
of
ways
of
evading
the
law
were
tried
and
some
of
them
were
successful
the
statute
for
instance
permitted
any
man
to
take
liquor
with
meals
after
two
or
three
months
a
magistrate
was
found
who
decided
judicially
that
seventeen
beers
and
one
pretzel
made
a
meal
after
which
decision
joy
again
became
unconfined
in
at
least
some
of
the
saloons
and
the
yellow
press
gleefully
announced
that
my
tyranny
had
been
curbed
but
my
prime
object
that
of
stopping
blackmail
was
largely
attained
all
kinds
of
incidents
occurred
in
connection
with
this
crusade
one
of
them
introduced
me
to
a
friend
who
remains
a
friend
yet
his
name
was
edward
bourke
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
entered
the
police
force
through
our
examinations
shortly
after
i
took
office
i
had
summoned
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
successful
applicants
to
let
me
look
over
them
and
as
i
walked
into
the
hall
one
of
them
a
man
called
out
sharply
to
the
others
gangway
making
them
move
to
one
side
i
found
he
had
served
in
the
united
states
navy
the
incident
was
sufficient
to
make
me
keep
him
in
mind
a
month
later
i
was
notified
by
a
police
reporter
a
very
good
fellow
that
bourke
was
in
difficulties
and
that
he
thought
i
had
better
look
into
the
matter
myself
as
bourke
was
being
accused
by
certain
very
influential
men
of
grave
misconduct
in
an
arrest
he
had
made
the
night
before
accordingly
i
took
the
matter
up
personally
i
found
that
on
the
new
patrolman
beat
the
preceding
night
a
new
beat
there
was
a
big
saloon
run
by
a
man
of
great
influence
in
political
circles
known
as
king
calahan
after
midnight
the
saloon
was
still
running
in
full
blast
and
bourke
stepping
inside
told
calahan
to
close
up
it
was
at
the
time
filled
with
friends
of
personal
liberty
as
governor
hill
used
at
that
time
in
moments
of
pathos
to
term
everybody
who
regarded
as
tyranny
any
restriction
on
the
sale
of
liquor
calahan
saloon
had
never
before
in
its
history
been
closed
and
to
have
a
green
cop
tell
him
to
close
it
seemed
to
him
so
incredible
that
he
regarded
it
merely
as
a
bad
jest
on
his
next
round
bourke
stepped
in
and
repeated
the
order
calahan
felt
that
the
jest
had
gone
too
far
and
by
way
of
protest
knocked
bourke
down
this
was
an
error
of
judgment
on
his
part
for
when
bourke
arose
he
knocked
down
calahan
the
two
then
grappled
and
fell
on
the
floor
while
the
friends
of
personal
liberty
danced
around
the
fight
and
endeavored
to
stamp
on
everything
they
thought
was
calahan
however
bourke
though
pretty
roughly
handled
got
his
man
and
shut
the
saloon
when
he
appeared
against
the
lawbreaker
in
court
next
day
he
found
the
crowded
with
influential
tammany
hall
politicians
backed
by
one
or
two
republican
leaders
of
the
same
type
for
calahan
was
a
baron
of
the
underworld
and
both
his
feudal
superiors
and
his
feudal
inferiors
gathered
to
the
rescue
his
backers
in
court
included
a
congressman
and
a
state
senator
and
so
was
the
police
belief
in
pull
that
his
own
superiors
had
turned
against
bourke
and
were
preparing
to
sacrifice
him
just
at
this
time
i
acted
on
the
information
given
me
by
my
newspaper
friend
by
starting
in
person
for
the
court
the
knowledge
that
i
knew
what
was
going
on
that
i
meant
what
i
said
and
that
i
intended
to
make
the
affair
personal
was
all
that
was
necessary
before
i
reached
the
court
all
effort
to
defend
calahan
had
promptly
ceased
and
bourke
had
come
forth
triumphant
i
immediately
promoted
him
to
roundsman
he
is
a
captain
now
he
has
been
on
the
force
ever
since
save
that
when
the
spanish
war
came
he
obtained
a
holiday
without
pay
for
six
months
and
reentered
the
navy
serving
as
gun
captain
in
one
of
the
gunboats
and
doing
his
work
as
was
to
be
expected
in
fashion
especially
when
under
fire
let
me
again
say
that
when
men
tell
me
that
the
police
are
irredeemably
bad
i
remember
scores
and
hundreds
of
cases
like
this
of
bourke
like
the
case
i
have
already
mentioned
of
raphael
like
the
other
cases
i
have
given
above
it
is
useless
to
tell
me
that
these
men
are
bad
they
are
naturally
men
there
are
no
better
men
anywhere
than
the
men
of
the
new
york
police
force
and
when
they
go
bad
it
is
because
the
system
is
wrong
and
because
they
are
not
given
the
chance
to
do
the
good
work
they
can
do
and
would
rather
do
i
never
coddled
these
men
i
punished
them
severely
whenever
i
thought
their
conduct
required
it
all
i
did
was
to
try
to
be
just
to
reward
them
when
they
did
well
in
short
to
act
squarely
by
them
i
believe
that
as
a
whole
they
liked
me
when
in
i
ran
for
president
on
the
progressive
ticket
i
received
a
number
of
unsigned
letters
inclosing
sums
of
money
for
the
campaign
one
of
these
inclosed
twenty
dollars
the
writer
who
did
not
give
his
name
said
that
he
was
a
policeman
that
i
had
once
had
him
before
me
on
charges
and
had
fined
him
twenty
dollars
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
not
committed
the
offense
for
which
i
fined
him
but
that
the
evidence
was
such
that
he
did
not
wonder
that
i
had
been
misled
and
never
blamed
me
for
it
because
i
had
acted
squarely
and
had
given
honest
and
decent
men
a
chance
in
the
police
department
and
that
now
he
inclosed
a
bill
the
amount
of
the
fine
inflicted
on
him
so
many
years
before
i
have
always
wished
i
knew
who
the
man
was
the
disciplinary
courts
were
very
interesting
but
it
was
extraordinarily
difficult
to
get
at
the
facts
in
the
more
complicated
cases
as
must
always
be
true
under
similar
circumstances
for
ordinarily
it
is
necessary
to
back
up
the
superior
officer
who
makes
the
charge
and
yet
it
is
always
possible
that
this
superior
officer
is
consciously
or
unconsciously
biased
against
his
subordinate
in
the
courts
the
charges
were
sometimes
brought
by
police
officers
and
sometimes
by
private
citizens
in
the
latter
case
we
would
get
queer
insights
into
twilight
phases
of
new
york
life
it
was
necessary
to
be
always
on
our
guard
often
an
accusation
would
be
brought
against
the
policeman
because
he
had
been
guilty
of
misconduct
much
more
often
the
accusation
merely
meant
that
the
officer
had
incurred
animosity
by
doing
his
duty
i
remember
one
amusing
case
where
the
officer
was
wholly
to
blame
but
had
acted
in
entire
good
faith
one
of
the
favorite
and
most
demoralizing
forms
of
gambling
in
new
york
was
the
policy
slips
consisted
of
papers
with
three
rows
of
figures
written
on
them
the
officer
in
question
was
a
huge
pithecoid
lout
of
a
creature
with
a
wooden
face
and
a
receding
forehead
and
his
accuser
whom
he
had
arrested
the
preceding
evening
was
a
little
grig
of
a
man
obviously
respectable
and
almost
incoherent
with
rage
the
anger
of
the
little
man
was
but
natural
for
he
had
just
come
out
from
a
night
in
the
he
had
been
arrested
late
in
the
evening
on
suspicion
that
he
was
a
because
of
the
rows
of
figures
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
and
because
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
had
just
stepped
into
the
entrance
of
the
hall
of
a
in
order
to
read
by
lamplight
the
paper
was
produced
in
evidence
there
were
the
three
rows
of
figures
all
right
but
as
the
accused
explained
hopping
up
and
down
with
rage
and
excitement
they
were
all
of
them
the
numbers
of
hymns
he
was
the
superintendent
of
a
small
he
had
written
down
the
hymns
for
several
future
services
one
under
the
other
and
on
the
way
home
was
stopping
to
look
at
them
under
convenient
and
finally
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
a
hallway
and
it
was
this
conduct
which
struck
the
sagacious
man
in
uniform
as
suspicious
one
of
the
saddest
features
of
police
work
is
dealing
with
the
social
evil
with
prostitutes
and
houses
of
ill
fame
in
so
far
as
the
law
gave
me
power
i
always
treated
the
men
taken
in
any
raid
on
these
houses
precisely
as
the
women
were
treated
my
experience
brought
me
to
the
very
strong
conviction
that
there
ought
not
to
be
any
toleration
by
law
of
the
vice
i
do
not
know
of
any
method
which
will
put
a
complete
stop
to
the
evil
but
i
do
know
certain
things
that
ought
to
be
done
to
minimize
it
one
of
these
is
treating
men
and
women
on
an
exact
equality
for
the
same
act
another
is
the
establishment
of
night
courts
and
of
special
commissions
to
deal
with
this
special
class
of
cases
another
is
that
suggested
by
the
rev
charles
stelzle
of
the
labor
temple
to
publish
conspicuously
the
name
of
the
owner
of
any
property
used
for
immoral
purposes
after
said
owner
had
been
notified
of
the
use
and
has
failed
to
prevent
it
another
is
to
prosecute
the
keepers
and
backers
of
brothels
men
and
women
as
relentlessly
and
punish
them
as
severely
as
pickpockets
and
common
thieves
they
should
never
be
fined
they
should
be
imprisoned
as
for
the
girls
the
very
young
ones
and
first
offenders
should
be
put
in
the
charge
of
probation
officers
or
sent
to
reformatories
and
the
large
percentage
of
girls
and
of
incorrigible
girls
and
women
should
be
sent
to
institutions
created
for
them
we
would
thus
remove
from
this
hideous
commerce
the
articles
of
commerce
moreover
the
federal
government
must
in
measure
proceed
against
the
degraded
promoters
of
this
commercialism
for
their
activities
are
and
the
nation
can
often
deal
with
them
more
effectively
than
the
states
although
as
public
sentiment
becomes
aroused
nation
state
and
municipality
will
all
cooperate
towards
the
same
end
of
rooting
out
the
traffic
but
the
prime
need
is
to
raise
the
level
of
individual
morality
and
moreover
to
encourage
early
marriages
the
single
standard
of
and
a
strict
sense
of
reciprocal
conjugal
obligation
the
women
who
preach
late
marriages
are
by
just
so
much
making
it
difficult
to
better
the
standard
of
chastity
as
regards
the
white
slave
traffic
the
men
engaged
in
it
and
the
women
too
are
far
worse
criminals
than
any
ordinary
murderers
can
be
for
them
there
is
need
of
such
a
law
as
that
recently
adopted
in
england
through
the
efforts
of
arthur
lee
a
law
which
includes
whipping
for
the
male
offenders
there
are
brutes
so
low
so
infamous
so
degraded
and
bestial
in
their
cruelty
and
brutality
that
the
only
way
to
get
at
them
is
through
their
skins
sentimentality
on
behalf
of
such
men
is
really
almost
as
unhealthy
and
wicked
as
the
criminality
of
the
men
themselves
my
experience
is
that
there
should
be
no
toleration
of
any
tenderloin
or
red
light
district
and
that
above
all
there
should
be
the
most
relentless
war
on
commercialized
vice
the
men
who
profit
and
make
their
living
by
the
depravity
and
the
awful
misery
of
other
human
beings
stand
far
below
any
ordinary
criminals
and
no
measures
taken
against
them
can
be
too
severe
as
for
the
wretched
girls
who
follow
the
dreadful
trade
in
question
a
good
deal
can
be
done
by
a
change
in
economic
conditions
this
ought
to
be
done
when
girls
are
paid
wages
inadequate
to
keep
them
from
starvation
or
to
permit
them
to
live
decently
a
certain
proportion
are
forced
by
their
economic
misery
into
lives
of
vice
the
employers
and
all
others
responsible
for
these
conditions
stand
on
a
moral
level
not
far
above
the
white
slavers
themselves
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
either
the
correction
of
these
economic
conditions
or
the
abolition
of
the
white
slave
trade
will
wholly
correct
the
evil
or
will
even
reach
the
major
part
of
it
the
economic
factor
is
very
far
from
being
the
chief
factor
in
inducing
girls
to
go
into
this
dreadful
life
as
with
so
many
other
problems
while
there
must
be
governmental
action
there
must
also
be
strengthening
of
the
average
individual
character
in
order
to
achieve
the
desired
end
even
where
economic
conditions
are
bad
girls
who
are
both
strong
and
pure
will
remain
unaffected
by
temptations
to
which
girls
of
weak
character
or
lax
standards
readily
yield
any
man
who
knows
the
wide
variation
in
the
proportions
of
the
different
races
and
nationalities
engaged
in
prostitution
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
treat
economic
conditions
as
the
sole
conditions
or
even
as
the
chief
conditions
that
determine
this
question
there
are
certain
races
the
irish
are
honorably
conspicuous
among
them
which
no
matter
what
the
economic
pressure
furnish
relatively
few
inmates
of
houses
of
ill
fame
i
do
not
believe
that
the
differences
are
due
to
permanent
race
characteristics
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
best
settlement
houses
find
that
practically
all
their
graduates
so
to
speak
all
the
girls
that
come
for
a
long
period
under
their
influence
no
matter
what
their
race
or
national
origin
remain
pure
in
every
race
there
are
some
naturally
vicious
individuals
and
some
weak
individuals
who
readily
succumb
under
economic
pressure
a
girl
who
is
lazy
and
hates
hard
work
a
girl
whose
mind
is
rather
feeble
and
who
is
of
subnormal
intelligence
as
the
phrase
now
goes
or
a
girl
who
craves
cheap
finery
and
vapid
pleasure
is
always
in
danger
a
high
ideal
of
personal
purity
is
essential
where
the
same
pressure
under
the
same
economic
conditions
has
tenfold
the
effect
on
one
set
of
people
that
it
has
on
another
it
is
evident
that
the
question
of
moral
standards
is
even
more
important
than
the
question
of
economic
standards
very
important
though
this
question
is
it
is
important
for
us
to
remember
that
the
girl
ought
to
have
the
chance
not
only
for
the
necessaries
of
life
but
for
innocent
pleasure
and
that
even
more
than
the
man
she
must
not
be
broken
by
overwork
by
excessive
toil
moreover
public
opinion
and
the
law
should
combine
to
hunt
down
the
flagrant
man
swine
who
himself
hunts
down
poor
or
silly
or
unprotected
girls
but
we
must
not
in
foolish
sentimentality
excuse
the
girl
from
her
duty
to
keep
herself
pure
our
duty
to
achieve
the
same
moral
level
for
the
two
sexes
must
be
performed
by
raising
the
level
for
the
man
not
by
lowering
it
for
the
woman
and
the
fact
that
society
must
recognize
its
duty
in
no
shape
or
way
relieves
not
even
to
the
smallest
degree
the
individual
from
doing
his
or
her
duty
sentimentality
which
grows
maudlin
on
behalf
of
the
willful
prostitute
is
a
curse
to
confound
her
with
the
entrapped
or
coerced
girl
the
real
white
slave
is
both
foolish
and
wicked
there
are
evil
women
just
as
there
are
evil
men
naturally
depraved
girls
just
as
there
are
naturally
depraved
young
men
and
the
right
and
wise
thing
the
just
thing
to
them
and
the
generous
thing
to
innocent
girls
and
decent
men
is
to
wage
stern
war
against
the
evil
creatures
of
both
sexes
in
company
with
jacob
riis
i
did
much
work
that
was
not
connected
with
the
actual
discipline
of
the
force
or
indeed
with
the
actual
work
of
the
force
there
was
one
thing
which
he
and
i
abolished
police
which
were
simply
tramp
and
a
fruitful
encouragement
to
vagrancy
those
who
read
riis
story
of
his
own
life
will
remember
the
incidents
that
gave
him
from
actual
personal
experience
his
horror
of
these
tramp
as
member
of
the
health
board
i
was
brought
into
very
close
relations
with
the
conditions
of
life
in
the
districts
here
again
i
used
to
visit
the
different
regions
usually
in
company
with
riis
to
see
for
myself
what
the
conditions
were
it
was
largely
this
personal
experience
that
enabled
me
while
on
the
health
board
to
struggle
not
only
zealously
but
with
reasonable
efficiency
and
success
to
improve
conditions
we
did
our
share
in
making
forward
strides
in
the
matter
of
housing
the
working
people
of
the
city
with
some
regard
to
decency
and
comfort
the
midnight
trips
that
riis
and
i
took
enabled
me
to
see
what
the
police
department
was
doing
and
also
gave
me
personal
insight
into
some
of
the
problems
of
city
life
it
is
one
thing
to
listen
in
perfunctory
fashion
to
tales
of
overcrowded
tenements
and
it
is
quite
another
actually
to
see
what
that
overcrowding
means
some
hot
summer
night
by
even
a
single
inspection
during
the
hours
of
darkness
there
was
a
very
hot
spell
one
midsummer
while
i
was
police
commissioner
and
most
of
each
night
i
spent
walking
through
the
districts
and
visiting
police
stations
to
see
what
was
being
done
it
was
a
tragic
week
we
did
everything
possible
to
alleviate
the
suffering
much
of
it
was
heartbreaking
especially
the
gasping
misery
of
the
little
children
and
of
the
mothers
every
resource
of
the
health
department
of
the
police
department
and
even
the
fire
department
which
flooded
the
hot
streets
was
taxed
in
the
effort
to
render
service
the
heat
killed
such
multitudes
of
horses
that
the
means
at
our
disposal
for
removing
the
poor
dead
beasts
proved
quite
inadequate
although
every
nerve
was
strained
to
the
limit
in
consequence
we
received
scores
of
complaints
from
persons
before
whose
doors
dead
horses
had
remained
festering
in
the
heat
for
two
or
three
days
one
irascible
man
sent
us
furious
denunciations
until
we
were
at
last
able
to
send
a
big
dray
to
drag
away
the
horse
that
lay
dead
before
his
shop
door
the
huge
dray
already
contained
eleven
other
dead
horses
and
when
it
reached
this
particular
door
it
broke
down
and
it
was
hours
before
it
could
be
moved
the
unfortunate
man
who
had
thus
been
cursed
with
a
granted
wish
closed
his
doors
in
despair
and
wrote
us
a
final
pathetic
letter
in
which
he
requested
us
to
remove
either
the
horses
or
his
shop
he
did
care
which
i
have
spoken
before
of
my
experience
with
the
cigar
factory
law
which
the
highest
court
of
new
york
state
declared
unconstitutional
my
experience
in
the
police
department
taught
me
that
not
a
few
of
the
worst
were
owned
by
wealthy
individuals
who
hired
the
best
and
most
expensive
lawyers
to
persuade
the
courts
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
insist
on
the
betterment
of
conditions
these
business
men
and
lawyers
were
very
adroit
in
using
a
word
with
fine
and
noble
associations
to
cloak
their
opposition
to
vitally
necessary
movements
for
industrial
fair
play
and
decency
they
made
it
evident
that
they
valued
the
constitution
not
as
a
help
to
righteousness
but
as
a
means
for
thwarting
movements
against
unrighteousness
after
my
experience
with
them
i
became
more
set
than
ever
in
my
distrust
of
those
men
whether
business
men
or
lawyers
judges
legislators
or
executive
officers
who
seek
to
make
of
the
constitution
a
fetich
for
the
prevention
of
the
work
of
social
reform
for
the
prevention
of
work
in
the
interest
of
those
men
women
and
children
on
whose
behalf
we
should
be
at
liberty
to
employ
freely
every
governmental
agency
occasionally
during
the
two
years
we
had
to
put
a
stop
to
riotous
violence
and
now
and
then
on
these
occasions
some
of
the
labor
union
leaders
protested
against
the
actions
of
the
police
by
this
time
i
was
becoming
a
strong
believer
in
labor
unions
a
strong
believer
in
the
rights
of
labor
for
that
very
reason
i
was
all
the
more
bound
to
see
that
lawlessness
and
disorder
were
put
down
and
that
no
rioter
was
permitted
to
masquerade
under
the
guise
of
being
a
friend
of
labor
or
a
sympathizer
with
labor
i
was
scrupulous
to
see
that
the
labor
men
had
fair
play
that
for
instance
they
were
allowed
to
picket
just
so
far
as
under
the
law
picketing
could
be
permitted
so
that
the
strikers
had
ample
opportunity
peacefully
to
persuade
other
labor
men
not
to
take
their
places
but
i
made
it
clearly
and
definitely
understood
that
under
no
circumstances
would
i
permit
violence
or
fail
to
insist
upon
the
keeping
of
order
if
there
were
wrongs
i
would
join
with
a
full
heart
in
striving
to
have
them
corrected
but
where
there
was
violence
all
other
questions
had
to
drop
until
order
was
restored
this
is
a
democracy
and
the
people
have
the
power
if
they
choose
to
exercise
it
to
make
conditions
as
they
ought
to
be
made
and
to
do
this
strictly
within
the
law
and
therefore
the
first
duty
of
the
true
democrat
of
the
man
really
loyal
to
the
principles
of
popular
government
is
to
see
that
law
is
enforced
and
order
upheld
it
was
a
peculiar
gratification
to
me
that
so
many
of
the
labor
leaders
with
whom
i
was
thrown
in
contact
grew
cordially
to
accept
this
view
when
i
left
the
department
several
called
upon
me
to
say
how
sorry
they
were
that
i
was
not
to
continue
in
office
one
the
secretary
of
the
journeyman
bakers
and
confectioners
international
union
henry
weismann
wrote
me
expressing
his
regret
that
i
was
going
and
his
appreciation
as
a
citizen
of
what
i
had
done
as
police
commissioner
he
added
i
am
particularly
grateful
for
your
liberal
attitude
toward
organized
labor
your
cordial
championship
of
those
speaking
in
behalf
of
the
toilers
and
your
evident
desire
to
do
the
right
thing
as
you
saw
it
at
whatever
cost
some
of
the
letters
i
received
on
leaving
the
department
were
from
unexpected
sources
godkin
an
editor
who
in
international
matters
was
not
a
patriotic
man
wrote
protesting
against
my
taking
the
of
the
navy
and
adding
i
have
a
concern
as
the
quakers
say
to
put
on
record
my
earnest
belief
that
in
new
york
you
are
doing
the
greatest
work
of
which
any
american
is
capable
and
exhibiting
to
the
young
men
of
the
country
the
spectacle
of
a
very
important
office
administered
by
a
man
of
high
character
in
the
most
efficient
way
amid
a
thousand
difficulties
as
a
lesson
in
politics
i
can
not
think
of
anything
more
instructive
about
the
same
time
i
had
a
letter
from
afterwards
ambassador
james
bryce
also
expressing
regret
that
i
was
leaving
the
police
department
but
naturally
with
much
more
appreciation
of
the
work
that
was
to
be
done
in
the
navy
department
this
letter
i
quote
with
his
permission
because
it
conveys
a
lesson
to
those
who
are
inclined
always
to
think
that
the
conditions
of
the
present
time
are
very
bad
it
was
written
july
bryce
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
coming
to
america
in
a
month
or
so
and
continued
i
hope
i
may
have
a
chance
of
seeing
you
if
i
do
get
over
and
of
drawing
some
comfort
from
you
as
regards
your
political
phenomena
which
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
those
of
your
countrymen
i
have
lately
seen
furnish
some
good
opportunities
for
a
persistent
optimist
like
myself
to
show
that
he
is
not
to
be
lightly
discouraged
do
suppose
that
things
are
specially
as
a
lady
would
say
in
europe
either
they
are
not
bryce
was
a
very
friendly
and
extraordinary
competent
observer
of
things
american
and
there
was
this
distinct
note
of
discouragement
about
our
future
in
the
intimate
letter
he
was
thus
sending
yet
this
was
at
the
very
time
when
the
united
states
was
entering
on
a
dozen
years
during
which
our
people
accomplished
more
good
and
came
nearer
realizing
the
possibilities
of
a
great
free
and
conscientious
democracy
than
during
any
other
dozen
years
in
our
history
save
only
the
years
of
presidency
and
the
period
during
which
the
nation
was
founded
chapter
vii
the
war
of
america
the
unready
i
suppose
the
united
states
will
always
be
unready
for
war
and
in
consequence
will
always
be
exposed
to
great
expense
and
to
the
possibility
of
the
gravest
calamity
when
the
nation
goes
to
war
this
is
no
new
thing
americans
learn
only
from
catastrophes
and
not
from
experience
there
would
have
been
no
war
in
if
in
the
previous
decade
america
instead
of
announcing
that
peace
was
her
passion
instead
of
acting
on
the
theory
that
unpreparedness
averts
war
had
been
willing
to
go
to
the
expense
of
providing
a
fleet
of
a
score
of
ships
of
the
line
however
in
that
case
doubtless
the
very
men
who
in
the
actual
event
deplored
the
loss
of
life
and
waste
of
capital
which
their
own
supineness
had
brought
about
would
have
loudly
inveighed
against
the
excessive
and
improper
cost
of
armaments
so
it
all
came
to
about
the
same
thing
in
the
end
there
is
no
more
thoroughgoing
international
gummidge
and
no
more
utterly
useless
and
often
utterly
mischievous
citizen
than
the
type
of
being
who
is
always
complaining
either
about
war
or
else
about
the
cost
of
the
armaments
which
act
as
the
insurance
against
war
there
is
every
reason
why
we
should
try
to
limit
the
cost
of
armaments
as
these
tend
to
grow
excessive
but
there
is
also
every
reason
to
remember
that
in
the
present
stage
of
civilization
a
proper
armament
is
the
surest
guarantee
of
peace
and
is
the
only
guarantee
that
war
if
it
does
come
will
not
mean
irreparable
and
overwhelming
disaster
in
the
spring
of
president
mckinley
appointed
me
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
i
owed
the
appointment
chiefly
to
the
efforts
of
senator
lodge
of
massachusetts
who
doubtless
was
actuated
mainly
by
his
long
and
close
friendship
for
me
but
also
i
like
to
believe
by
his
keen
interest
in
the
navy
the
first
book
i
had
ever
published
fifteen
years
previously
was
the
history
of
the
naval
war
of
and
i
have
always
taken
the
interest
in
the
navy
which
every
good
american
ought
to
take
at
the
time
i
wrote
the
book
in
the
early
eighties
the
navy
had
reached
its
nadir
and
we
were
then
utterly
incompetent
to
fight
spain
or
any
other
power
that
had
a
navy
at
all
shortly
afterwards
we
began
timidly
and
hesitatingly
to
build
up
a
fleet
it
is
amusing
to
recall
the
roundabout
steps
we
took
to
accomplish
our
purpose
in
the
reaction
after
the
colossal
struggle
of
the
civil
war
our
strongest
and
most
capable
men
had
thrown
their
whole
energy
into
business
into
into
the
development
and
above
all
the
exploitation
and
exhaustion
at
the
most
rapid
rate
possible
of
our
natural
resources
mines
forests
soil
and
rivers
these
men
were
not
weak
men
but
they
permitted
themselves
to
grow
shortsighted
and
selfish
and
while
many
of
them
down
at
the
bottom
possessed
the
fundamental
virtues
including
the
fighting
virtues
others
were
purely
of
the
glorified
huckster
or
glorified
pawnbroker
type
which
when
developed
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
makes
about
as
poor
a
national
type
as
the
world
has
seen
this
unadulterated
huckster
or
pawnbroker
type
is
rarely
keenly
sympathetic
in
matters
of
social
and
industrial
justice
and
is
usually
physically
timid
and
likes
to
cover
an
unworthy
fear
of
the
most
just
war
under
names
it
was
reinforced
by
the
large
mollycoddle
vote
the
people
who
are
soft
physically
and
morally
or
who
have
a
twist
in
them
which
makes
them
acidly
cantankerous
and
unpleasant
as
long
as
they
can
be
so
with
safety
to
their
bodies
in
addition
there
are
the
good
people
with
no
imagination
and
no
foresight
who
think
war
will
not
come
but
that
if
it
does
come
armies
and
navies
can
be
improvised
a
very
large
element
typified
by
a
senator
i
knew
personally
who
in
a
public
speech
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
what
we
would
do
if
america
were
suddenly
assailed
by
a
military
power
answered
that
we
would
build
a
in
every
creek
then
among
the
wise
and
people
who
in
and
genuine
fashion
strive
earnestly
for
peace
there
are
the
foolish
fanatics
always
to
be
found
in
such
a
movement
and
always
discrediting
it
the
men
who
form
the
lunatic
fringe
in
all
reform
movements
all
these
elements
taken
together
made
a
body
of
public
opinion
so
important
during
the
decades
immediately
succeeding
the
civil
war
as
to
put
a
stop
to
any
serious
effort
to
keep
the
nation
in
a
condition
of
reasonable
military
preparedness
the
representatives
of
this
opinion
then
voted
just
as
they
now
do
when
they
vote
against
or
against
fortifying
the
panama
canal
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
if
we
had
been
content
to
be
weak
and
in
view
of
our
weakness
not
to
bluster
but
we
were
not
content
with
such
a
policy
we
wished
to
enjoy
the
incompatible
luxuries
of
an
unbridled
tongue
and
an
unready
hand
there
was
a
very
large
element
which
was
ignorant
of
our
military
weakness
or
naturally
enough
unable
to
understand
it
and
another
large
element
which
liked
to
please
its
own
vanity
by
listening
to
offensive
talk
about
foreign
nations
accordingly
too
many
of
our
politicians
especially
in
congress
found
that
the
cheap
and
easy
thing
to
do
was
to
please
the
foolish
peace
people
by
keeping
us
weak
and
to
please
the
foolish
violent
people
by
passing
denunciatory
resolutions
about
international
matters
resolutions
which
would
have
been
improper
even
if
we
had
been
strong
their
idea
was
to
please
both
the
mollycoddle
vote
and
the
vote
of
the
international
by
upholding
with
pretended
ardor
and
mean
intelligence
a
national
policy
of
peace
with
insult
i
abhor
unjust
war
i
abhor
injustice
and
bullying
by
the
strong
at
the
expense
of
the
weak
whether
among
nations
or
individuals
i
abhor
violence
and
bloodshed
i
believe
that
war
should
never
be
resorted
to
when
or
so
long
as
it
is
honorably
possible
to
avoid
it
i
respect
all
men
and
women
who
from
high
motives
and
with
sanity
and
do
all
they
can
to
avert
war
i
advocate
preparation
for
war
in
order
to
avert
war
and
i
should
never
advocate
war
unless
it
were
the
only
alternative
to
dishonor
i
describe
the
folly
of
which
so
many
of
our
people
were
formerly
guilty
in
order
that
we
may
in
our
own
day
be
on
our
guard
against
similar
folly
we
did
not
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
take
our
foreign
duties
seriously
and
as
we
combined
bluster
in
speech
with
refusal
to
make
any
preparation
whatsoever
for
action
we
were
not
taken
seriously
in
return
gradually
a
slight
change
for
the
better
occurred
the
writings
of
captain
mahan
playing
no
small
part
therein
we
built
some
modern
cruisers
to
start
with
the
people
who
felt
that
were
wicked
compromising
with
their
misguided
consciences
by
saying
that
the
cruisers
could
be
used
to
protect
our
commerce
which
they
could
not
be
unless
they
had
to
back
them
then
we
attempted
to
build
more
powerful
fighting
vessels
and
as
there
was
a
section
of
the
public
which
regarded
as
possessing
a
name
immorally
suggestive
of
violence
we
compromised
by
calling
the
new
ships
armored
cruisers
and
making
them
combine
with
exquisite
nicety
all
the
defects
and
none
of
the
virtues
of
both
types
then
we
got
to
the
point
of
building
but
there
still
remained
a
public
opinion
as
old
as
the
time
of
jefferson
which
thought
that
in
the
event
of
war
all
our
problem
ought
to
be
one
of
coast
defense
that
we
should
do
nothing
except
repel
attack
an
attitude
about
as
sensible
as
that
of
a
who
expected
to
win
by
merely
parrying
instead
of
hitting
to
meet
the
susceptibilities
of
this
large
class
of
people
we
provided
for
the
under
the
name
of
coast
defense
meaning
thereby
that
we
did
not
make
them
quite
as
seaworthy
as
they
ought
to
have
been
or
with
quite
as
much
coal
capacity
as
they
ought
to
have
had
then
we
decided
to
build
real
but
there
still
remained
a
lingering
remnant
of
public
opinion
that
clung
to
the
coast
defense
theory
and
we
met
this
in
beautiful
fashion
by
providing
for
coast
defense
the
fact
that
the
name
was
a
contradiction
in
terms
being
of
very
small
consequence
compared
to
the
fact
that
we
did
thereby
get
real
our
men
had
to
be
trained
to
handle
the
ships
singly
and
in
fleet
formation
and
they
had
to
be
trained
to
use
the
new
weapons
of
precision
with
which
the
ships
were
armed
not
a
few
of
the
older
officers
kept
in
the
service
under
our
foolish
rule
of
pure
seniority
promotion
were
not
competent
for
the
task
but
a
proportion
of
the
older
officers
were
excellent
and
this
was
true
of
almost
all
the
younger
officers
they
were
naturally
men
trained
in
the
admirable
naval
school
at
annapolis
they
were
overjoyed
that
at
last
they
were
given
proper
instruments
to
work
with
and
they
speedily
grew
to
handle
these
ships
individually
in
the
best
fashion
they
were
fast
learning
to
handle
them
in
squadron
and
fleet
formation
but
when
the
war
with
spain
broke
out
they
had
as
yet
hardly
grasped
the
principles
of
modern
scientific
naval
gunnery
soon
after
i
began
work
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
i
became
convinced
that
the
war
would
come
the
revolt
in
cuba
had
dragged
its
weary
length
until
conditions
in
the
island
had
become
so
dreadful
as
to
be
a
standing
disgrace
to
us
for
permitting
them
to
exist
there
is
much
that
i
sincerely
admire
about
the
spanish
character
and
there
are
few
men
for
whom
i
have
felt
greater
respect
than
for
certain
gentlemen
of
spain
whom
i
have
known
but
spain
attempted
to
govern
her
colonies
on
archaic
principles
which
rendered
her
control
of
them
incompatible
with
the
advance
of
humanity
and
intolerable
to
the
conscience
of
mankind
in
the
war
in
cuba
had
dragged
along
for
years
with
unspeakable
horror
degradation
and
misery
it
was
not
war
at
all
but
murderous
oppression
cuba
was
devastated
during
those
years
while
we
continued
at
peace
several
hundred
times
as
many
lives
were
lost
lives
of
men
women
and
children
as
were
lost
during
the
three
months
war
which
put
an
end
to
this
slaughter
and
opened
a
career
of
peaceful
progress
to
the
cubans
yet
there
were
misguided
professional
philanthropists
who
cared
so
much
more
for
names
than
for
facts
that
they
preferred
a
peace
of
continuous
murder
to
a
war
which
stopped
the
murder
and
brought
real
peace
humiliation
was
certain
anyhow
indeed
it
was
more
certain
without
war
than
with
it
for
she
could
not
permanently
keep
the
island
and
she
minded
yielding
to
the
cubans
more
than
yielding
to
us
our
own
direct
interests
were
great
because
of
the
cuban
tobacco
and
sugar
and
especially
because
of
cuba
relation
to
the
projected
isthmian
canal
but
even
greater
were
our
interests
from
the
standpoint
of
humanity
cuba
was
at
our
very
doors
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
for
us
to
sit
supinely
and
watch
her
death
agony
it
was
our
duty
even
more
from
the
standpoint
of
national
honor
than
from
the
standpoint
of
national
interest
to
stop
the
devastation
and
destruction
because
of
these
considerations
i
favored
war
and
when
in
retrospect
it
is
easier
to
see
things
clearly
there
are
few
humane
and
honorable
men
who
do
not
believe
that
the
war
was
both
just
and
necessary
the
big
financiers
and
the
men
generally
who
were
susceptible
to
touch
on
the
money
nerve
and
who
cared
nothing
for
national
honor
if
it
conflicted
even
temporarily
with
business
prosperity
were
against
the
war
the
more
fatuous
type
of
philanthropist
agreed
with
them
the
newspapers
controlled
by
or
run
in
the
interests
of
these
two
classes
deprecated
war
and
did
everything
in
their
power
to
prevent
any
preparation
for
war
as
a
whole
the
people
in
congress
were
at
that
time
and
are
now
a
shortsighted
set
as
regards
international
matters
there
were
a
few
men
senators
cushman
davis
for
instance
and
john
morgan
who
did
look
ahead
and
senator
lodge
who
throughout
his
quarter
of
a
century
of
service
in
the
senate
and
house
has
ever
stood
foremost
among
those
who
uphold
with
farsighted
fearlessness
and
strict
justice
to
others
our
national
honor
and
interest
but
most
of
the
congressmen
were
content
to
follow
the
worst
of
all
possible
courses
that
is
to
pass
resolutions
which
made
war
more
likely
and
yet
to
decline
to
take
measures
which
would
enable
us
to
meet
the
war
if
it
did
come
in
a
letter
written
me
just
before
i
became
assistant
secretary
senator
davis
unburdened
his
mind
about
one
of
the
foolish
peace
proposals
of
that
period
his
letter
running
in
part
i
left
the
senate
chamber
about
three
this
afternoon
when
there
was
going
on
a
deal
of
mowing
and
chattering
over
the
treaty
by
which
the
united
states
is
to
be
bound
to
arbitrate
its
sovereign
functions
for
policies
are
matters
of
sovereignty
the
aberrations
of
the
social
movement
are
neither
progress
nor
retrogression
they
represent
merely
a
local
and
temporary
sagging
of
the
line
of
the
great
orbit
tennyson
knew
this
when
he
wrote
that
fine
and
noble
i
often
read
it
for
to
do
so
does
me
good
after
quoting
one
of
stories
the
letter
continues
the
world
will
come
out
all
right
let
him
who
believes
in
the
decline
of
the
military
spirit
observe
the
boys
of
a
common
school
during
the
recess
or
the
noon
hour
of
course
when
american
patriotism
speaks
out
from
its
rank
and
file
and
demands
action
or
expression
and
when
thereupon
the
man
so
called
places
his
hand
on
his
stack
of
reds
as
if
he
feared
a
policeman
were
about
to
disturb
the
game
and
protests
until
american
patriotism
ceases
to
continue
to
speak
as
it
had
started
to
do
why
you
and
i
get
mad
and
i
swear
i
hope
you
will
be
with
us
here
after
march
we
can
then
pass
judgment
together
on
the
things
we
do
like
and
together
indulge
in
hopes
that
i
believe
are
prophetic
however
in
the
navy
department
we
were
able
to
do
a
good
deal
thanks
to
the
energy
and
ability
of
some
of
the
bureau
chiefs
and
to
the
general
good
tone
of
the
service
i
soon
found
my
natural
friends
and
allies
in
such
men
as
evans
taylor
sampson
wainwright
brownson
schroeder
bradford
cowles
cameron
winslow
and
others
like
them
i
used
all
the
power
there
was
in
my
office
to
aid
these
men
in
getting
the
material
ready
i
also
tried
to
gather
from
every
source
information
as
to
who
the
best
men
were
to
occupy
the
fighting
positions
sound
naval
opinion
was
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
dewey
to
command
one
squadron
i
was
already
watching
him
for
i
had
been
struck
by
an
incident
in
his
past
career
it
was
at
a
time
when
there
was
threat
of
trouble
with
chile
dewey
was
off
the
argentine
and
was
told
to
get
ready
to
move
to
the
other
coast
of
south
america
if
the
move
became
necessary
he
would
have
to
have
coal
and
yet
if
he
did
not
make
the
move
the
coal
would
not
be
needed
in
such
a
case
a
man
afraid
of
responsibility
always
acts
rigidly
by
the
regulations
and
communicates
with
the
department
at
home
to
get
authority
for
everything
he
does
and
therefore
he
usually
accomplishes
nothing
whatever
but
is
able
to
satisfy
all
individuals
with
minds
by
triumphantly
pointing
out
his
compliance
with
the
regulations
in
a
crisis
the
man
worth
his
salt
is
the
man
who
meets
the
needs
of
the
situation
in
whatever
way
is
necessary
dewey
purchased
the
coal
and
was
ready
to
move
at
once
if
need
arose
the
affair
blew
over
the
need
to
move
did
not
occur
and
for
some
time
there
seemed
to
be
a
chance
that
dewey
would
get
into
trouble
over
having
purchased
the
coal
for
our
people
are
like
almost
all
other
peoples
in
requiring
responsible
officers
under
such
conditions
to
decide
at
their
own
personal
peril
no
matter
which
course
they
follow
however
the
people
higher
up
ultimately
stood
by
dewey
the
incident
made
me
feel
that
here
was
a
man
who
could
be
relied
upon
to
prepare
in
advance
and
to
act
promptly
fearlessly
and
on
his
own
responsibility
when
the
emergency
arose
accordingly
i
did
my
best
to
get
him
put
in
command
of
the
asiatic
fleet
the
fleet
where
it
was
most
essential
to
have
a
man
who
would
act
without
referring
things
back
to
the
home
authorities
an
officer
senior
to
him
of
the
respectable
commonplace
type
was
being
pushed
by
certain
politicians
who
i
knew
had
influence
with
the
navy
department
and
with
the
president
i
would
have
preferred
to
see
dewey
get
the
appointment
without
appealing
to
any
politician
at
all
but
while
this
was
my
preference
the
essential
thing
was
to
get
him
the
appointment
for
a
naval
officer
to
bring
pressure
to
get
himself
a
soft
and
easy
place
is
unpardonable
but
a
large
leniency
should
be
observed
toward
the
man
who
uses
influence
only
to
get
himself
a
place
in
the
picture
near
the
flashing
of
the
guns
there
was
a
senator
proctor
of
vermont
who
i
knew
was
close
to
mckinley
and
who
was
very
ardent
for
the
war
and
desirous
to
have
it
fought
in
the
most
efficient
fashion
i
suggested
to
dewey
that
he
should
enlist
the
services
of
senator
proctor
which
was
accordingly
done
in
a
fortunate
hour
for
the
nation
dewey
was
given
command
of
the
asiatic
squadron
when
the
maine
was
blown
up
in
havana
harbor
war
became
inevitable
a
number
of
the
men
of
course
promptly
assumed
the
position
that
she
had
blown
herself
up
but
investigation
showed
that
the
explosion
was
from
outside
and
in
any
event
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
prevent
war
the
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
who
often
grew
bored
to
the
point
of
desertion
in
peace
became
keyed
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
efficiency
and
crowds
of
fine
young
fellows
from
the
interior
as
well
as
from
the
seacoast
thronged
to
enlist
the
navy
officers
showed
alert
ability
and
unwearied
industry
in
getting
things
ready
there
was
one
deficiency
however
which
there
was
no
time
to
remedy
and
of
the
very
existence
of
which
strange
to
say
most
of
our
best
men
were
ignorant
our
navy
had
no
idea
how
low
our
standard
of
marksmanship
was
we
had
not
realized
that
the
modern
had
become
such
a
complicated
piece
of
mechanism
that
the
old
methods
of
training
in
marksmanship
were
as
obsolete
as
the
old
broadside
guns
themselves
almost
the
only
man
in
the
navy
who
fully
realized
this
was
our
naval
attache
at
paris
lieutenant
sims
he
wrote
letter
after
letter
pointing
out
how
frightfully
backward
we
were
in
marksmanship
i
was
much
impressed
by
his
letters
but
wainwright
was
about
the
only
other
man
who
was
and
as
sims
proved
to
be
mistaken
in
his
belief
that
the
french
had
taught
the
spaniards
how
to
shoot
and
as
the
spaniards
proved
to
be
much
worse
even
than
we
were
in
the
service
generally
sims
was
treated
as
an
alarmist
but
although
i
at
first
partly
acquiesced
in
this
view
i
grew
uneasy
when
i
studied
the
small
proportion
of
hits
to
shots
made
by
our
vessels
in
battle
when
i
was
president
i
took
up
the
matter
and
speedily
became
convinced
that
we
needed
to
revolutionize
our
whole
training
in
marksmanship
sims
was
given
the
lead
in
organizing
and
introducing
the
new
system
and
to
him
more
than
to
any
other
one
man
was
due
the
astonishing
progress
made
by
our
fleet
in
this
respect
a
progress
which
made
the
fleet
gun
for
gun
at
least
three
times
as
effective
in
point
of
fighting
efficiency
in
as
it
was
in
the
shots
that
hit
are
the
shots
that
count
like
the
people
the
government
was
for
a
long
time
unwilling
to
prepare
for
war
because
so
many
honest
but
misguided
men
believed
that
the
preparation
itself
tended
to
bring
on
the
war
i
did
not
in
the
least
share
this
feeling
and
whenever
i
was
left
as
acting
secretary
i
did
everything
in
my
power
to
put
us
in
readiness
i
knew
that
in
the
event
of
war
dewey
could
be
slipped
like
a
from
a
leash
i
was
sure
that
if
he
were
given
half
a
chance
he
would
strike
instantly
and
with
telling
effect
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
all
i
could
do
to
give
him
that
should
be
done
i
was
in
the
closest
touch
with
senator
lodge
throughout
this
period
and
either
consulted
him
about
or
notified
him
of
all
the
moves
i
was
taking
by
the
end
of
february
i
felt
it
was
vital
to
send
dewey
as
well
as
each
of
our
other
commanders
who
were
not
in
home
waters
instructions
that
would
enable
him
to
be
in
readiness
for
immediate
action
on
the
afternoon
of
saturday
february
when
i
was
acting
secretary
lodge
called
on
me
just
as
i
was
preparing
the
order
which
as
it
was
addressed
to
a
man
of
the
right
stamp
was
of
much
importance
to
the
subsequent
operations
admiral
dewey
speaks
of
the
incident
as
follows
in
his
autobiography
the
first
real
step
as
regards
active
naval
preparations
was
taken
on
february
when
telegraphic
instructions
were
sent
to
the
asiatic
european
and
south
atlantic
squadrons
to
rendezvous
at
certain
convenient
points
where
should
war
break
out
they
would
be
most
available
the
message
to
the
asiatic
squadron
bore
the
signature
of
that
assistant
secretary
who
had
seized
the
opportunity
while
acting
secretary
to
hasten
preparations
for
a
conflict
which
was
inevitable
as
roosevelt
reasoned
precautions
for
readiness
would
cost
little
in
time
of
peace
and
yet
would
be
invaluable
in
case
of
war
his
cablegram
was
as
follows
february
hong
the
squadron
except
the
monocacy
to
hong
kong
keep
full
of
coal
in
the
event
of
declaration
of
war
spain
your
duty
will
be
to
see
that
the
spanish
squadron
does
not
leave
the
asiatic
coast
and
then
offensive
operations
in
philippine
islands
keep
olympia
until
further
orders
the
reference
to
keeping
the
olympia
until
further
orders
was
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
been
notified
that
she
would
soon
be
recalled
to
the
united
states
all
that
was
needed
with
dewey
was
to
give
him
the
chance
to
get
ready
and
then
to
strike
without
being
hampered
by
orders
from
those
not
on
the
ground
success
in
war
depends
very
largely
upon
choosing
a
man
fit
to
exercise
such
powers
and
then
giving
him
the
powers
it
would
be
instructive
to
remember
if
only
we
were
willing
to
do
so
the
fairly
comic
panic
which
swept
in
waves
over
our
seacoast
first
when
it
became
evident
that
war
was
about
to
be
declared
and
then
when
it
was
declared
the
public
waked
up
to
the
sufficiently
obvious
fact
that
the
government
was
in
its
usual
state
perennial
unreadiness
for
war
thereupon
the
people
of
the
seaboard
district
passed
at
one
bound
from
unreasoning
confidence
that
war
never
could
come
to
unreasoning
fear
as
to
what
might
happen
now
that
it
had
come
that
acute
philosopher
dooley
proclaimed
that
in
the
spanish
war
we
were
in
a
dream
but
that
the
spaniards
were
in
a
trance
this
just
about
summed
up
the
facts
our
people
had
for
decades
scoffed
at
the
thought
of
making
ready
for
possible
war
now
when
it
was
too
late
they
not
only
backed
every
measure
wise
and
unwise
that
offered
a
chance
of
supplying
a
need
that
ought
to
have
been
met
before
but
they
also
fell
into
a
condition
of
panic
apprehension
as
to
what
the
foe
might
do
for
years
we
had
been
saying
just
as
any
number
of
our
people
now
say
that
no
nation
would
venture
to
attack
us
then
when
we
did
go
to
war
with
an
exceedingly
feeble
nation
we
for
the
time
being
rushed
to
the
other
extreme
of
feeling
and
attributed
to
this
feeble
nation
plans
of
offensive
warfare
which
it
never
dreamed
of
making
and
which
if
made
it
would
have
been
wholly
unable
to
execute
some
of
my
readers
doubtless
remember
the
sinister
intentions
and
unlimited
potentialities
for
destruction
with
which
the
fertile
imagination
of
the
yellow
press
endowed
the
armored
cruiser
viscaya
when
she
appeared
in
american
waters
just
before
war
was
declared
the
state
of
nervousness
along
much
of
the
seacoast
was
funny
in
view
of
the
lack
of
foundation
for
it
but
it
offered
food
for
serious
thought
as
to
what
would
happen
if
we
ever
became
engaged
with
a
serious
foe
the
governor
of
one
state
actually
announced
that
he
would
not
permit
the
national
guard
of
that
state
to
leave
its
borders
the
idea
being
to
retain
it
against
a
possible
spanish
invasion
so
many
of
the
business
men
of
the
city
of
boston
took
their
securities
inland
to
worcester
that
the
safe
deposit
companies
of
worcester
proved
unable
to
take
care
of
them
in
my
own
neighborhood
on
long
island
clauses
were
gravely
put
into
leases
to
the
effect
that
if
the
property
were
destroyed
by
the
spaniards
the
lease
should
lapse
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
i
had
every
conceivable
impossible
request
made
to
me
members
of
congress
who
had
actively
opposed
building
any
navy
came
clamorously
around
to
ask
each
for
a
ship
for
some
special
purpose
of
protection
connected
with
his
district
it
seems
incredible
but
it
is
true
that
not
only
these
congressmen
but
the
chambers
of
commerce
and
boards
of
trade
of
different
coast
cities
all
lost
their
heads
for
the
time
being
and
raised
a
deafening
clamor
and
brought
every
species
of
pressure
to
bear
on
the
administration
to
get
it
to
adopt
the
one
most
fatal
course
that
is
to
distribute
the
navy
ship
by
ship
at
all
kinds
of
points
and
in
all
kinds
of
ports
with
the
idea
of
protecting
everything
everywhere
and
thereby
rendering
it
absolutely
certain
that
even
the
spanish
fleet
poor
though
it
was
would
be
able
to
pick
up
our
own
navy
ship
by
ship
in
detail
one
congressman
besought
me
for
a
ship
to
protect
jekyll
island
off
the
coast
of
georgia
an
island
which
derived
its
sole
consequence
because
it
contained
the
winter
homes
of
certain
millionaires
a
lady
whose
husband
occupied
a
very
influential
position
and
who
was
normally
a
most
admirable
and
sensible
woman
came
to
insist
that
a
ship
should
be
anchored
off
a
huge
seaside
hotel
because
she
had
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
there
were
many
such
instances
one
stood
out
above
the
others
a
certain
seaboard
state
contained
in
its
congressional
delegation
one
of
the
most
influential
men
in
the
senate
and
one
of
the
most
influential
men
in
the
lower
house
these
two
men
had
been
worse
than
lukewarm
about
building
up
the
navy
and
had
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
there
ever
being
any
danger
from
any
foreign
power
with
the
advent
of
war
the
feelings
of
their
constituents
and
therefore
their
own
feelings
suffered
an
immediate
change
and
they
demanded
that
a
ship
be
anchored
in
the
harbor
of
their
city
as
a
protection
getting
no
comfort
from
me
they
went
higher
up
and
became
a
kind
of
permanent
committee
in
attendance
upon
the
president
they
were
very
influential
men
in
the
houses
with
whom
it
was
important
for
the
administration
to
keep
on
good
terms
and
moreover
they
possessed
a
pertinacity
as
great
as
the
widow
who
won
her
case
from
the
unjust
judge
finally
the
president
gave
in
and
notified
me
to
see
that
a
ship
was
sent
to
the
city
in
question
i
was
bound
that
as
long
as
a
ship
had
to
be
sent
it
should
not
be
a
ship
worth
anything
accordingly
a
civil
war
monitor
with
one
gun
managed
by
a
crew
of
about
naval
militia
was
sent
to
the
city
in
question
under
convoy
of
a
tug
it
was
a
hazardous
trip
for
the
unfortunate
naval
militiamen
but
it
was
safely
accomplished
and
joy
and
peace
descended
upon
the
senator
and
the
congressman
and
upon
the
president
whom
they
had
jointly
harassed
incidentally
the
fact
that
the
protecting
would
not
have
been
a
formidable
foe
to
any
antagonists
of
much
more
modern
construction
than
the
galleys
of
alcibiades
seemed
to
disturb
nobody
this
was
one
side
of
the
picture
the
other
side
was
that
the
crisis
at
once
brought
to
the
front
any
amount
of
latent
fighting
strength
there
were
plenty
of
congressmen
who
showed
wisdom
and
resolution
the
plain
people
the
men
and
women
back
of
the
persons
who
lost
their
heads
set
seriously
to
work
to
see
that
we
did
whatever
was
necessary
and
made
the
job
a
thorough
one
the
young
men
swarmed
to
enlist
in
time
of
peace
it
had
been
difficult
to
fill
the
scanty
regular
army
and
navy
and
there
were
innumerable
desertions
now
the
ships
and
regiments
were
and
so
many
deserters
returned
in
order
to
fight
that
it
became
difficult
to
decide
what
to
do
with
them
england
and
to
a
less
degree
japan
were
friendly
the
great
powers
of
continental
europe
were
all
unfriendly
they
jeered
at
our
ships
and
men
and
with
fatuous
partisanship
insisted
that
the
spaniards
would
prove
too
much
for
our
mercenaries
because
we
were
a
commercial
people
of
low
ideals
who
could
not
fight
while
the
men
whom
we
attempted
to
hire
for
that
purpose
were
certain
to
run
on
the
day
of
battle
among
my
friends
was
the
then
army
surgeon
leonard
wood
he
was
a
surgeon
not
having
an
income
he
had
to
earn
his
own
living
he
had
gone
through
the
harvard
medical
school
and
had
then
joined
the
army
in
the
southwest
as
a
contract
doctor
he
had
every
physical
moral
and
mental
quality
which
fitted
him
for
a
soldier
life
and
for
the
exercise
of
command
in
the
inconceivably
wearing
and
harassing
campaigns
against
the
apaches
he
had
served
nominally
as
a
surgeon
really
in
command
of
troops
on
more
than
one
expedition
he
was
as
anxious
as
i
was
that
if
there
were
war
we
should
both
have
our
part
in
it
i
had
always
felt
that
if
there
were
a
serious
war
i
wished
to
be
in
a
position
to
explain
to
my
children
why
i
did
take
part
in
it
and
not
why
i
did
not
take
part
in
it
moreover
i
had
very
deeply
felt
that
it
was
our
duty
to
free
cuba
and
i
had
publicly
expressed
this
feeling
and
when
a
man
takes
such
a
position
he
ought
to
be
willing
to
make
his
words
good
by
his
deeds
unless
there
is
some
very
strong
reason
to
the
contrary
he
should
pay
with
his
body
as
soon
as
war
was
upon
us
wood
and
i
began
to
try
for
a
chance
to
go
to
the
front
congress
had
authorized
the
raising
of
three
national
volunteer
cavalry
regiments
wholly
apart
from
the
state
contingents
secretary
alger
of
the
war
department
was
fond
of
me
personally
and
wood
was
his
family
doctor
alger
had
been
a
gallant
soldier
in
the
civil
war
and
was
almost
the
only
member
of
the
administration
who
felt
all
along
that
we
would
have
to
go
to
war
with
spain
over
cuba
he
liked
my
attitude
in
the
matter
and
because
of
his
remembrance
of
his
own
experiences
he
sympathized
with
my
desire
to
go
to
the
front
accordingly
he
offered
me
the
command
of
one
of
the
regiments
i
told
him
that
after
six
weeks
service
in
the
field
i
would
feel
competent
to
handle
the
regiment
but
that
i
would
not
know
how
to
equip
it
or
how
to
get
it
into
the
first
action
but
that
wood
was
entirely
competent
at
once
to
take
command
and
that
if
he
would
make
wood
colonel
i
would
accept
the
general
alger
thought
this
an
act
of
foolish
on
my
part
instead
of
its
being
what
it
was
the
wisest
act
i
could
have
performed
he
told
me
to
accept
the
colonelcy
and
that
he
would
make
wood
and
that
wood
would
do
the
work
anyway
but
i
answered
that
i
did
not
wish
to
rise
on
any
man
shoulders
that
i
hoped
to
be
given
every
chance
that
my
deeds
and
abilities
warranted
but
that
i
did
not
wish
what
i
did
not
earn
and
that
above
all
i
did
not
wish
to
hold
any
position
where
any
one
else
did
the
work
he
laughed
at
me
a
little
and
said
i
was
foolish
but
i
do
not
think
he
really
minded
and
he
promised
to
do
as
i
wished
true
to
his
word
he
secured
the
appointment
of
wood
as
colonel
and
of
myself
as
of
the
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
this
was
soon
nicknamed
both
by
the
public
and
by
the
rest
of
the
army
the
rough
riders
doubtless
because
the
bulk
of
the
men
were
from
the
southwestern
ranch
country
and
were
skilled
in
the
wild
horsemanship
of
the
great
plains
wood
instantly
began
the
work
of
raising
the
regiment
he
first
assembled
several
old
officers
of
experience
put
them
in
office
and
gave
them
blanks
for
requisitions
for
the
full
equipment
of
a
cavalry
regiment
he
selected
san
antonio
as
the
as
it
was
in
a
good
horse
country
near
the
gulf
from
some
port
on
which
we
would
have
to
embark
and
near
an
old
arsenal
and
an
old
army
post
from
which
we
got
a
good
deal
of
stuff
some
of
it
practically
condemned
but
which
we
found
serviceable
at
a
pinch
and
much
better
than
nothing
he
organized
a
horse
board
in
texas
and
began
purchasing
all
horses
that
were
not
too
big
and
were
sound
a
day
or
two
after
he
was
commissioned
he
wrote
out
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
war
under
his
authority
telegrams
to
the
governors
of
arizona
new
mexico
oklahoma
and
indian
territory
in
substance
as
follows
the
president
desires
to
raise
volunteers
in
your
territory
to
form
part
of
a
regiment
of
mounted
riflemen
to
be
commanded
by
leonard
wood
colonel
theodore
roosevelt
he
desires
that
the
men
selected
should
be
young
sound
good
shots
and
good
riders
and
that
you
expedite
by
all
means
in
your
power
the
enrollment
of
these
men
signed
alger
secretary
of
war
as
soon
as
he
had
attended
to
a
few
more
odds
and
ends
he
left
washington
and
the
day
after
his
arrival
in
san
antonio
the
troops
began
to
arrive
for
several
weeks
before
i
joined
the
regiment
to
which
wood
went
ahead
of
me
i
continued
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
trying
to
get
some
coherence
of
plan
between
the
war
department
and
the
navy
department
and
also
being
used
by
wood
to
finish
getting
the
equipment
for
the
regiment
as
regards
finding
out
what
the
plans
of
the
war
department
were
the
task
was
simple
they
had
no
plans
even
during
the
final
months
before
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
very
little
was
done
in
the
way
of
efficient
preparation
on
one
occasion
when
every
one
knew
that
the
declaration
of
war
was
sure
to
come
in
a
few
days
i
went
on
military
business
to
the
office
of
one
of
the
highest
line
generals
of
the
army
a
man
who
at
that
moment
ought
to
have
been
working
eighteen
hours
out
of
the
on
the
vital
problems
ahead
of
him
what
he
was
actually
doing
was
trying
on
a
new
type
of
uniform
on
certain
enlisted
men
and
he
called
me
in
to
ask
my
advice
as
to
the
position
of
the
pockets
in
the
blouse
with
a
view
to
making
it
look
attractive
an
aide
of
this
general
funnily
enough
a
good
fighting
man
in
actual
service
when
i
consulted
him
as
to
what
my
uniform
for
the
campaign
should
be
laid
special
stress
upon
my
purchasing
a
pair
of
black
top
boots
for
full
dress
explaining
that
they
were
very
effective
on
hotel
piazzas
and
in
parlors
i
did
not
intend
to
be
in
any
hotel
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
and
as
things
turned
out
i
had
no
uniform
nothing
but
my
service
uniform
during
my
brief
experience
in
the
army
i
suppose
that
war
always
does
bring
out
what
is
highest
and
lowest
in
human
nature
the
contractors
who
furnish
poor
materials
to
the
army
or
the
navy
in
time
of
war
stand
on
a
level
of
infamy
only
one
degree
above
that
of
the
participants
in
the
white
slave
traffic
themselves
but
there
is
conduct
far
short
of
this
which
yet
seems
inexplicable
to
any
man
who
has
in
him
any
spirit
of
disinterested
patriotism
combined
with
any
power
of
imagination
respectable
men
who
i
suppose
lack
the
imagination
thoroughly
to
realize
what
they
are
doing
try
to
make
money
out
of
the
nation
necessities
in
war
at
the
very
time
that
other
men
are
making
every
sacrifice
financial
and
personal
for
the
cause
in
the
closing
weeks
of
my
service
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
we
were
collecting
ships
for
auxiliary
purposes
some
men
at
cost
to
their
own
purses
helped
us
freely
and
with
efficiency
others
treated
the
affair
as
an
ordinary
business
transaction
and
yet
others
endeavored
at
some
given
crisis
when
our
need
was
great
to
sell
us
inferior
vessels
at
exorbitant
prices
and
used
every
pressure
through
senators
and
congressmen
to
accomplish
their
ends
in
one
or
two
cases
they
did
accomplish
them
too
until
we
got
a
really
board
established
to
superintend
such
purchases
a
more
curious
experience
was
in
connection
with
the
point
chosen
for
the
starting
of
the
expedition
against
cuba
i
had
not
supposed
that
any
human
being
could
consider
this
matter
save
from
the
standpoint
of
military
need
but
one
morning
a
very
wealthy
and
influential
man
a
respectable
and
upright
man
according
to
his
own
lights
called
on
me
to
protest
against
our
choice
of
tampa
and
to
put
in
a
plea
for
a
certain
other
port
on
the
ground
that
his
railroad
was
entitled
to
its
share
of
the
profit
for
hauling
the
army
and
equipment
i
happened
to
know
that
at
this
time
this
very
man
had
kinsfolk
with
the
army
who
served
gallantly
and
the
circumstances
of
his
coming
to
me
were
such
as
to
show
that
he
was
not
acting
secretly
and
had
no
idea
that
there
was
anything
out
of
the
way
in
his
proposal
i
think
the
facts
were
merely
that
he
had
been
trained
to
regard
business
as
the
sole
object
in
life
and
that
he
lacked
the
imagination
to
enable
him
to
understand
the
real
nature
of
the
request
that
he
was
making
and
moreover
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
one
of
his
business
competitors
had
been
unduly
favored
the
war
department
was
in
far
worse
shape
than
the
navy
department
the
young
officers
turned
out
from
west
point
are
precisely
as
good
as
the
young
officers
turned
out
from
annapolis
and
this
always
has
been
true
but
at
that
time
something
has
been
done
to
remedy
the
worst
conditions
since
and
ever
since
the
close
of
the
civil
war
the
conditions
were
such
that
after
a
few
years
the
army
officer
stagnated
so
far
as
his
profession
was
concerned
when
the
spanish
war
broke
out
the
navy
really
was
largely
on
a
war
footing
as
any
navy
which
is
even
respectably
cared
for
in
time
of
peace
must
be
the
admirals
captains
and
lieutenants
were
continually
practicing
their
profession
in
almost
precisely
the
way
that
it
has
to
be
practiced
in
time
of
war
except
actually
shooting
at
a
foe
most
of
the
men
on
board
ship
went
through
in
time
of
peace
practically
all
that
they
would
have
to
go
through
in
time
of
war
the
heads
of
bureaus
in
the
navy
department
were
for
the
most
part
men
who
had
seen
sea
service
who
expected
to
return
to
sea
service
and
who
were
preparing
for
needs
which
they
themselves
knew
by
experience
moreover
the
civilian
head
of
the
navy
had
to
provide
for
keeping
the
ships
in
a
state
of
reasonable
efficiency
and
congress
could
not
hopelessly
misbehave
itself
about
the
navy
without
the
fact
at
once
becoming
evident
all
this
was
changed
so
far
as
the
army
was
concerned
not
only
was
it
possible
to
decrease
the
efficiency
of
the
army
without
being
called
to
account
for
it
but
the
only
way
in
which
the
secretary
of
war
could
gain
credit
for
himself
or
the
administration
was
by
economy
and
the
easiest
way
to
economize
was
in
connection
with
something
that
would
not
be
felt
unless
war
should
arise
the
people
took
no
interest
whatever
in
the
army
demagogues
clamored
against
it
and
inadequate
though
it
was
in
size
insisted
that
it
should
be
still
further
reduced
popular
orators
always
appealed
to
the
volunteers
the
regulars
had
no
votes
and
there
was
no
point
in
politicians
thinking
of
them
the
chief
activity
shown
by
congressmen
about
the
army
was
in
getting
special
army
posts
built
in
places
where
there
was
no
need
for
them
even
the
work
of
the
army
in
its
campaigns
against
the
indians
was
of
such
a
character
that
it
was
generally
performed
by
small
bodies
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
men
until
a
man
ceased
being
a
lieutenant
he
usually
had
plenty
of
professional
work
to
attend
to
and
was
employed
in
the
field
and
in
short
had
the
same
kind
of
practice
that
his
brother
in
the
navy
had
and
he
did
his
work
as
well
but
once
past
this
stage
he
had
almost
no
opportunity
to
perform
any
work
corresponding
to
his
rank
and
but
little
opportunity
to
do
any
military
work
whatsoever
the
very
best
men
men
like
lawton
young
chaffee
hawkins
and
sumner
to
mention
only
men
under
or
beside
whom
i
served
remained
good
soldiers
soldiers
of
the
best
stamp
in
spite
of
the
disheartening
conditions
but
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
average
man
could
continue
to
grow
when
every
influence
was
against
him
accordingly
when
the
spanish
war
suddenly
burst
upon
us
a
number
of
inert
elderly
captains
and
field
officers
were
much
against
their
own
wishes
suddenly
pitchforked
into
the
command
of
regiments
brigades
and
even
divisions
and
army
corps
often
these
men
failed
painfully
this
was
not
their
fault
it
was
the
fault
of
the
nation
that
is
the
fault
of
all
of
us
of
you
my
reader
and
of
myself
and
of
those
like
us
because
we
had
permitted
conditions
to
be
such
as
to
render
these
men
unfit
for
command
take
a
stout
captain
of
an
post
where
nothing
in
the
world
ever
occurred
even
resembling
military
action
and
where
the
only
military
problem
that
really
convulsed
the
post
to
its
foundations
was
the
quarrel
between
the
captain
and
the
quartermaster
as
to
how
high
a
mule
tail
ought
to
be
shaved
i
am
speaking
of
an
actual
incident
what
could
be
expected
of
such
a
man
even
though
years
before
he
had
been
a
gallant
second
lieutenant
in
the
civil
war
if
after
this
intervening
period
he
was
suddenly
put
in
command
of
raw
troops
in
a
midsummer
campaign
in
the
tropics
the
bureau
chiefs
were
for
the
most
part
elderly
incompetents
whose
idea
was
to
do
their
routine
duties
in
such
way
as
to
escape
the
censure
of
routine
bureaucratic
superiors
and
to
avoid
a
congressional
investigation
they
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
preparing
the
army
for
war
it
was
impossible
that
they
could
have
any
such
conception
the
people
and
the
congress
did
not
wish
the
army
prepared
for
war
and
those
editors
and
philanthropists
and
peace
advocates
who
felt
vaguely
that
if
the
army
were
incompetent
their
principles
were
safe
always
inveighed
against
any
proposal
to
make
it
efficient
on
the
ground
that
this
showed
a
natural
bloodthirstiness
in
the
proposer
when
such
were
the
conditions
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
either
the
war
department
or
the
army
could
do
well
in
the
event
of
war
secretary
alger
happened
to
be
secretary
when
war
broke
out
and
all
the
responsibility
for
the
shortcomings
of
the
department
were
visited
upon
his
devoted
head
he
was
made
the
scapegoat
for
our
national
shortcomings
the
fault
was
not
his
the
fault
and
responsibility
lay
with
us
the
people
who
for
years
had
permitted
our
representatives
in
congress
and
in
national
executive
office
to
bear
themselves
so
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
avoid
the
great
bulk
of
all
the
trouble
that
occurred
and
of
all
the
shortcomings
of
which
our
people
complained
during
the
spanish
war
the
chief
immediate
cause
was
the
conditions
of
bureaucracy
which
existed
in
the
war
department
at
washington
which
had
prevented
any
good
organization
or
the
preparation
of
any
good
plan
of
operation
for
using
our
men
and
supplies
the
recurrence
of
these
conditions
even
though
in
somewhat
less
aggravated
form
in
any
future
emergency
is
as
certain
as
sunrise
unless
we
bring
about
the
principle
of
a
four
years
detail
in
the
staff
corps
a
principle
which
congress
has
now
for
years
stubbornly
refused
to
grant
there
are
nations
who
only
need
to
have
peaceful
ideals
inculcated
and
to
whom
militarism
is
a
curse
and
a
misfortune
there
are
other
nations
like
our
own
so
happily
situated
that
the
thought
of
war
is
never
present
to
their
minds
they
are
wholly
free
from
any
tendency
improperly
to
exalt
or
to
practice
militarism
these
nations
should
never
forget
that
there
must
be
military
ideals
no
less
than
peaceful
ideals
the
exaltation
of
nogi
career
set
forth
so
strikingly
in
stanley
washburn
little
volume
on
the
great
japanese
warrior
contains
much
that
is
especially
needed
for
us
of
america
prone
as
we
are
to
regard
the
exigencies
of
a
purely
commercial
and
industrial
civilization
as
excusing
us
from
the
need
of
admiring
and
practicing
the
heroic
and
warlike
virtues
our
people
are
not
military
we
need
normally
only
a
small
standing
army
but
there
should
be
behind
it
a
reserve
of
instructed
men
big
enough
to
fill
it
up
to
full
war
strength
which
is
over
twice
the
peace
strength
moreover
the
young
men
of
the
country
should
realize
that
it
is
the
duty
of
every
one
of
them
to
prepare
himself
so
that
in
time
of
need
he
may
speedily
become
an
efficient
soldier
a
duty
now
generally
forgotten
but
which
should
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
vitally
essential
parts
of
every
man
training
in
endeavoring
to
get
the
rough
riders
equipped
i
met
with
some
experiences
which
were
both
odd
and
instructive
there
were
not
enough
arms
and
other
necessaries
to
go
round
and
there
was
keen
rivalry
among
the
intelligent
and
zealous
commanders
of
the
volunteer
organizations
as
to
who
should
get
first
choice
wood
experience
was
what
enabled
us
to
equip
ourselves
in
short
order
there
was
another
cavalry
organization
whose
commander
was
at
the
war
department
about
this
time
and
we
had
been
eyeing
him
with
much
alertness
as
a
rival
one
day
i
asked
him
what
his
plans
were
about
arming
and
drilling
his
troops
who
were
of
precisely
the
type
of
our
own
men
he
answered
that
he
expected
to
give
each
of
the
boys
two
revolvers
and
a
lariat
and
then
just
turn
them
loose
i
reported
the
conversation
to
wood
with
the
remark
that
we
might
feel
ourselves
safe
from
rivalry
in
that
quarter
and
safe
we
were
in
trying
to
get
the
equipment
i
met
with
checks
and
rebuffs
and
in
return
was
the
cause
of
worry
and
concern
to
various
bureau
chiefs
who
were
unquestionably
estimable
men
in
their
private
and
domestic
relations
and
who
doubtless
had
been
good
officers
thirty
years
before
but
who
were
as
unfit
for
modern
war
as
if
they
were
so
many
one
fine
old
fellow
did
his
best
to
persuade
us
to
take
black
powder
rifles
explaining
with
paternal
indulgence
that
no
one
yet
really
knew
just
what
smokeless
powder
might
do
and
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
favor
of
having
smoke
to
conceal
us
from
the
enemy
i
saw
this
pleasing
theory
actually
worked
out
in
practice
later
on
for
the
national
guard
regiments
with
us
at
santiago
had
black
powder
muskets
and
the
regular
artillery
black
powder
guns
and
they
really
might
almost
as
well
have
replaced
these
weapons
by
crossbows
and
mangonels
we
succeeded
thanks
to
wood
in
getting
the
same
cavalry
carbines
that
were
used
by
the
regulars
we
were
determined
to
do
this
not
only
because
the
weapons
were
good
but
because
this
would
in
all
probability
mean
that
we
were
brigaded
with
the
regular
cavalry
which
it
was
certain
would
be
sent
immediately
to
the
front
for
the
fighting
there
was
one
worthy
bureau
chief
who
was
continually
refusing
applications
of
mine
as
irregular
in
each
case
i
would
appeal
to
secretary
alger
who
helped
me
in
every
way
and
get
an
order
from
him
countenancing
the
irregularity
for
instance
i
found
out
that
as
we
were
nearer
the
july
date
than
the
january
date
for
the
issuance
of
clothing
and
as
it
had
long
been
customary
to
issue
the
winter
clothing
in
july
so
as
to
give
ample
leisure
for
getting
it
to
all
the
various
posts
it
was
therefore
solemnly
proposed
to
issue
this
same
winter
clothing
to
us
who
were
about
to
start
for
a
summer
campaign
in
the
tropics
this
would
seem
incredible
to
those
who
have
never
dealt
with
an
inert
officialdom
a
bureaucracy
but
such
is
the
fact
i
rectified
this
and
got
an
order
for
khaki
clothing
we
were
then
told
we
would
have
to
advertise
thirty
days
for
horses
this
meant
that
we
would
have
missed
the
santiago
expedition
so
i
made
another
successful
appeal
to
the
secretary
other
difficulties
came
up
about
wagons
and
various
articles
and
in
each
case
the
same
result
followed
on
the
last
occasion
when
i
came
up
in
triumph
with
the
needed
order
the
worried
office
head
who
bore
me
no
animosity
but
who
did
feel
that
fate
had
been
very
unkind
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
oh
dear
i
had
this
office
running
in
such
good
shape
and
then
along
came
the
war
and
upset
everything
his
feeling
was
that
war
was
an
illegitimate
interruption
to
the
work
of
the
war
department
there
were
of
course
department
heads
and
bureau
chiefs
and
assistants
who
in
spite
of
the
worthlessness
of
the
system
and
of
the
paralyzing
conditions
that
had
prevailed
remained
men
an
example
of
these
was
weston
his
energy
activity
administrative
efficiency
and
common
sense
were
supplemented
by
an
eager
desire
to
help
everybody
do
the
best
that
could
be
done
both
in
washington
and
again
down
at
santiago
we
owed
him
very
much
when
i
was
president
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
repay
him
in
part
our
debt
which
means
the
debt
of
the
people
of
the
country
by
making
him
a
the
regiment
assembled
at
san
antonio
when
i
reached
there
the
men
rifles
and
horses
which
were
the
essentials
were
coming
in
fast
and
the
saddles
blankets
and
the
like
were
also
accumulating
thanks
to
wood
exertions
when
we
reached
tampa
we
were
rather
better
equipped
than
most
of
the
regular
regiments
we
adhered
strictly
to
field
equipment
allowing
no
luxuries
or
anything
else
unnecessary
and
so
we
were
able
to
move
off
the
field
when
ordered
with
our
own
transportation
leaving
nothing
behind
i
suppose
every
man
tends
to
brag
about
his
regiment
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
never
was
a
regiment
better
worth
bragging
about
than
ours
wood
was
an
exceptional
commander
of
great
power
with
a
remarkable
gift
for
organization
the
rank
and
file
were
as
fine
natural
fighting
men
as
ever
carried
a
rifle
or
rode
a
horse
in
any
country
or
any
age
we
had
a
number
of
young
fellows
from
the
east
most
of
them
from
colleges
like
harvard
yale
and
princeton
but
the
great
majority
of
the
men
were
southwesterners
from
the
then
territories
of
oklahoma
indian
territory
arizona
and
new
mexico
they
were
accustomed
to
the
use
of
firearms
accustomed
to
taking
care
of
themselves
in
the
open
they
were
intelligent
and
they
possessed
hardihood
and
endurance
and
physical
prowess
and
above
all
they
had
the
fighting
edge
the
cool
and
resolute
fighting
temper
they
went
into
the
war
with
full
knowledge
having
deliberately
counted
the
cost
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
each
man
was
chiefly
anxious
to
find
out
what
he
should
do
to
make
the
regiment
a
success
they
bought
first
and
last
about
copies
of
the
cavalry
drill
regulations
and
studied
them
industriously
such
men
were
practically
soldiers
to
start
with
in
all
the
essentials
it
is
small
wonder
that
with
them
as
material
to
work
upon
the
regiment
was
raised
armed
equipped
drilled
sent
on
trains
to
tampa
embarked
disembarked
and
put
through
two
victorious
offensive
not
defensive
fights
in
which
a
third
of
the
officers
and
of
the
men
were
killed
or
wounded
all
within
sixty
days
it
is
a
good
record
and
it
speaks
well
for
the
men
of
the
regiment
and
it
speaks
well
for
wood
to
counterbalance
the
newspapers
which
ignorantly
and
indiscriminately
praised
all
the
volunteers
there
were
others
whose
blame
was
of
the
same
intelligent
quality
the
new
york
on
june
gave
expression
to
the
following
gloomy
foreboding
competent
observers
have
remarked
that
nothing
more
extraordinary
has
been
done
than
the
sending
to
cuba
of
the
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
known
as
the
riders
organized
but
four
weeks
barely
given
their
full
complement
of
officers
and
only
a
week
of
regular
drill
these
men
have
been
sent
to
the
front
before
they
have
learned
the
first
elements
of
soldiering
and
discipline
or
have
even
become
acquainted
with
their
officers
in
addition
to
all
this
like
the
regular
cavalry
they
have
been
sent
with
only
their
carbines
and
revolvers
to
meet
an
enemy
armed
with
rifles
there
have
been
few
cases
of
such
military
cruelty
in
our
military
annals
a
week
or
so
after
this
not
wholly
happy
prophecy
was
promulgated
the
cruelty
was
consummated
first
at
las
guasimas
and
then
in
the
san
juan
fighting
wood
was
so
busy
getting
the
regiment
ready
that
when
i
reached
san
antonio
he
turned
most
of
the
drilling
of
it
over
to
me
this
was
a
piece
of
great
good
fortune
for
me
and
i
drilled
the
men
industriously
mounted
and
unmounted
i
had
plenty
to
learn
and
the
men
and
the
officers
even
more
but
we
went
at
our
work
with
the
heartiest
good
will
we
speedily
made
it
evident
that
there
was
no
room
and
no
mercy
for
any
man
who
shirked
any
duty
and
we
accomplished
good
results
the
fact
is
that
the
essentials
of
drill
and
work
for
a
cavalry
or
an
infantry
regiment
are
easy
to
learn
which
of
course
is
not
true
for
the
artillery
or
the
engineers
or
for
the
navy
the
reason
why
it
takes
so
long
to
turn
the
average
civilized
man
into
a
good
infantryman
or
cavalryman
is
because
it
takes
a
long
while
to
teach
the
average
untrained
man
how
to
shoot
to
ride
to
march
to
take
care
of
himself
in
the
open
to
be
alert
resourceful
cool
daring
and
resolute
to
obey
quickly
as
well
as
to
be
willing
and
to
fit
himself
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
if
he
already
possesses
these
qualities
there
is
very
little
difficulty
in
making
him
a
soldier
all
the
drill
that
is
necessary
to
enable
him
to
march
and
to
fight
is
of
a
simple
character
parade
ground
and
barrack
square
maneuvers
are
of
no
earthly
consequence
in
real
war
when
men
can
readily
change
from
line
to
column
and
column
to
line
can
form
front
in
any
direction
and
assemble
and
scatter
and
can
do
these
things
with
speed
and
precision
they
have
a
fairly
good
grasp
of
the
essentials
when
our
regiment
reached
tampa
it
could
already
be
handled
creditably
at
fast
gaits
and
both
in
mass
and
extended
formations
mounted
and
dismounted
i
had
served
three
years
in
the
new
york
national
guard
finally
becoming
a
captain
this
experience
was
invaluable
to
me
it
enabled
me
at
once
to
train
the
men
in
the
simple
drill
without
which
they
would
have
been
a
mob
for
although
the
drill
requirements
are
simple
they
are
also
absolutely
indispensable
but
if
i
had
believed
that
my
experience
in
the
national
guard
had
taught
me
all
that
there
was
to
teach
about
a
soldier
career
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
not
to
have
been
in
it
at
all
there
were
in
the
regiment
a
number
of
men
who
had
served
in
the
national
guard
and
a
number
of
others
who
had
served
in
the
regular
army
some
of
these
latter
had
served
in
the
field
in
the
west
under
campaign
conditions
and
were
accustomed
to
long
marches
privation
risk
and
unexpected
emergencies
these
men
were
of
the
utmost
benefit
to
the
regiment
they
already
knew
their
profession
and
could
teach
and
help
the
others
but
if
the
man
had
merely
served
in
a
national
guard
regiment
or
in
the
regular
army
at
some
post
in
a
civilized
country
where
he
learned
nothing
except
what
could
be
picked
up
on
the
parade
ground
in
the
barracks
and
in
practice
marches
of
a
few
miles
along
good
roads
then
it
depended
purely
upon
his
own
good
sense
whether
he
had
been
helped
or
hurt
by
the
experience
if
he
realized
that
he
had
learned
only
five
per
cent
of
his
profession
that
there
remained
per
cent
to
accomplish
before
he
would
be
a
good
soldier
why
he
had
profited
immensely
to
start
with
five
per
cent
handicap
was
a
very
great
advantage
and
if
the
man
was
really
a
good
man
he
could
not
be
overtaken
but
if
the
man
thought
that
he
had
learned
all
about
the
profession
of
a
soldier
because
he
had
been
in
the
national
guard
or
in
the
regular
army
under
the
conditions
i
have
described
then
he
was
actually
of
less
use
than
if
he
had
never
had
any
military
experience
at
all
such
a
man
was
apt
to
think
that
nicety
of
alignment
precision
in
wheeling
and
correctness
in
the
manual
of
arms
were
the
ends
of
training
and
the
guarantees
of
good
soldiership
and
that
from
guard
mounting
to
sentry
duty
everything
in
war
was
to
be
done
in
accordance
with
what
he
had
learned
in
peace
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
what
he
had
learned
was
never
used
at
all
and
some
of
it
had
to
be
unlearned
the
one
thing
for
instance
that
a
sentry
ought
never
to
do
in
an
actual
campaign
is
to
walk
up
and
down
a
line
where
he
will
be
conspicuous
his
business
is
to
lie
down
somewhere
off
a
ridge
crest
where
he
can
see
any
one
approaching
but
where
a
man
approaching
can
not
see
him
as
for
the
ceremonies
during
the
really
hard
part
of
a
campaign
only
the
barest
essentials
are
kept
almost
all
of
the
junior
regular
officers
and
many
of
the
senior
regular
officers
were
fine
men
but
through
no
fault
of
their
own
had
been
forced
to
lead
lives
that
fairly
paralyzed
their
efficiency
when
the
strain
of
modern
war
came
on
them
the
routine
elderly
regular
officer
who
knew
nothing
whatever
of
modern
war
was
in
most
respects
nearly
as
worthless
as
a
raw
recruit
the
positions
and
commands
prescribed
in
the
were
made
into
fetishes
by
some
of
these
men
and
treated
as
if
they
were
the
ends
instead
of
the
not
always
important
means
by
which
the
ends
were
to
be
achieved
in
the
cuban
fighting
for
instance
it
would
have
been
folly
for
me
to
have
taken
my
place
in
the
rear
of
the
regiment
the
canonical
position
my
business
was
to
be
where
i
could
keep
most
command
over
the
regiment
and
in
a
scrambling
fight
in
thick
jungle
this
had
to
depend
upon
the
course
of
events
and
usually
meant
that
i
had
to
be
at
the
front
i
saw
in
that
fighting
more
than
one
elderly
regimental
commander
who
unwittingly
rendered
the
only
service
he
could
render
to
his
regiment
by
taking
up
his
proper
position
several
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
when
the
fighting
began
for
then
the
regiment
disappeared
in
the
jungle
and
for
its
good
fortune
the
commanding
officer
never
saw
it
again
until
long
after
the
fight
was
over
after
one
cuban
fight
a
of
the
regulars
in
command
of
a
regiment
who
had
met
with
just
such
an
experience
and
had
rejoined
us
at
the
front
several
hours
after
the
close
of
the
fighting
asked
me
what
my
men
were
doing
when
the
fight
began
i
answered
that
they
were
following
in
trace
in
column
of
twos
and
that
the
instant
the
shooting
began
i
deployed
them
as
skirmishers
on
both
sides
of
the
trail
he
answered
triumphantly
you
ca
deploy
men
as
skirmishers
from
column
formation
to
which
i
responded
well
i
did
and
what
is
more
if
any
captain
had
made
any
difficulty
about
it
i
would
have
sent
him
to
the
rear
my
critic
was
quite
correct
from
the
parade
ground
standpoint
the
prescribed
orders
at
that
time
were
to
deploy
the
column
first
into
a
line
of
squads
at
correct
intervals
and
then
to
give
an
order
which
if
my
memory
serves
correctly
ran
as
skirmishers
by
the
right
and
left
flanks
at
six
yards
take
intervals
march
the
order
i
really
gave
ran
more
like
this
scatter
out
to
the
right
there
quick
you
scatter
to
the
left
look
alive
look
alive
and
they
looked
alive
and
they
scattered
and
each
took
advantage
of
cover
and
forward
went
the
line
now
i
do
not
wish
what
i
have
said
to
be
misunderstood
if
ever
we
have
a
great
war
the
bulk
of
our
soldiers
will
not
be
men
who
have
had
any
opportunity
to
train
soul
and
mind
and
body
so
as
to
meet
the
iron
needs
of
an
actual
campaign
long
continued
and
faithful
drill
will
alone
put
these
men
in
shape
to
begin
to
do
their
duty
and
failure
to
recognize
this
on
the
part
of
the
average
man
will
mean
laziness
and
folly
and
not
the
possession
of
efficiency
moreover
if
men
have
been
trained
to
believe
for
instance
that
they
can
arbitrate
questions
of
vital
interest
and
national
honor
if
they
have
been
brought
up
with
flabbiness
of
moral
fiber
as
well
as
flabbiness
of
physique
then
there
will
be
need
of
long
and
laborious
and
faithful
work
to
give
the
needed
tone
to
mind
and
body
but
if
the
men
have
in
them
the
right
stuff
it
is
not
so
very
difficult
at
san
antonio
we
entrained
for
tampa
in
various
sociological
books
by
authors
of
continental
europe
there
are
jeremiads
as
to
the
way
in
which
service
in
the
great
european
armies
with
their
minute
and
efficiency
and
regularity
tends
to
dwarf
the
capacity
for
individual
initiative
among
the
officers
and
men
there
is
no
such
danger
for
any
officer
or
man
of
a
volunteer
organization
in
america
when
our
country
with
playful
has
pranced
into
war
without
making
any
preparation
for
it
i
know
no
larger
or
finer
field
for
the
display
of
an
advanced
individualism
than
that
which
opened
before
us
as
we
went
from
san
antonio
to
tampa
camped
there
and
embarked
on
a
transport
for
cuba
nobody
ever
had
any
definite
information
to
give
us
and
whatever
information
we
unearthed
on
our
own
account
was
usually
wrong
each
of
us
had
to
show
an
alert
and
not
overscrupulous
in
order
to
obtain
food
for
his
men
provender
for
his
horses
or
transportation
of
any
kind
for
any
object
one
lesson
early
impressed
on
me
was
that
if
i
wanted
anything
to
eat
it
was
wise
to
carry
it
with
me
and
if
any
new
war
should
arise
i
would
earnestly
advise
the
men
of
every
volunteer
organization
always
to
proceed
upon
the
belief
that
their
supplies
will
not
turn
up
and
to
take
every
opportunity
of
getting
food
for
themselves
tampa
was
a
scene
of
the
wildest
confusion
there
were
miles
of
tracks
loaded
with
cars
of
the
contents
of
which
nobody
seemed
to
have
any
definite
knowledge
general
miles
who
was
supposed
to
have
supervision
over
everything
and
general
shafter
who
had
charge
of
the
expedition
were
both
there
but
thanks
to
the
fact
that
nobody
had
had
any
experience
in
handling
even
such
a
small
force
as
ours
about
men
there
was
no
semblance
of
order
wood
and
i
were
bound
that
we
should
not
be
left
behind
when
the
expedition
started
when
we
were
finally
informed
that
it
was
to
leave
next
morning
we
were
ordered
to
go
to
a
certain
track
to
meet
a
train
we
went
to
the
track
but
the
train
never
came
then
we
were
sent
to
another
track
to
meet
another
train
again
it
never
came
however
we
found
a
coal
train
of
which
we
took
possession
and
the
conductor
partly
under
duress
and
partly
in
a
spirit
of
friendly
helpfulness
took
us
down
to
the
quay
all
kinds
of
other
organizations
infantry
and
cavalry
regular
and
volunteer
were
arriving
at
the
quay
and
wandering
around
it
and
there
was
no
place
where
we
could
get
any
specific
information
as
to
what
transport
we
were
to
have
finally
wood
was
told
to
get
any
ship
you
can
get
which
is
not
already
assigned
he
borrowed
without
leave
a
small
motor
boat
and
commandeered
the
transport
yucatan
when
asked
by
the
captain
what
his
authority
was
he
reported
that
he
was
acting
by
orders
of
general
shafter
and
directed
the
ship
to
be
brought
to
the
dock
he
had
already
sent
me
word
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
the
ship
touched
the
pier
to
put
the
regiment
aboard
her
i
found
that
she
had
already
been
assigned
to
a
regular
regiment
and
to
another
volunteer
regiment
and
as
it
was
evident
that
not
more
than
half
of
the
men
assigned
to
her
could
possibly
get
on
i
was
determined
that
we
should
not
be
among
the
men
left
off
the
volunteer
regiment
offered
a
comparatively
easy
problem
i
simply
marched
my
men
past
them
to
the
allotted
place
and
held
the
gangway
with
the
regulars
i
had
to
be
a
little
more
diplomatic
because
their
commander
a
was
my
superior
in
rank
and
also
doubtless
knew
his
rights
he
sent
word
to
me
to
make
way
to
draw
my
regiment
off
to
one
side
and
let
his
take
possession
of
the
gangway
i
could
see
the
transport
coming
in
and
could
dimly
make
out
wood
figure
thereon
accordingly
i
played
for
time
i
sent
respectful
requests
through
his
officers
to
the
commander
of
the
regulars
entered
into
parleys
and
made
protestations
until
the
transport
got
near
enough
so
that
by
yelling
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
was
able
to
get
into
a
highly
constructive
communication
with
wood
what
he
was
saying
i
had
no
idea
but
he
was
evidently
speaking
and
on
my
own
responsibility
i
translated
it
into
directions
to
hold
the
gangway
and
so
informed
the
regulars
that
i
was
under
the
orders
of
my
superior
and
of
a
ranking
officer
and
to
my
great
regret
could
not
give
way
as
they
desired
as
soon
as
the
transport
was
fast
we
put
our
men
aboard
at
the
double
half
of
the
regular
regiment
got
on
and
the
other
half
and
the
other
volunteer
regiment
went
somewhere
else
we
were
kept
several
days
on
the
transport
which
was
jammed
with
men
so
that
it
was
hard
to
move
about
on
the
deck
then
the
fleet
got
under
way
and
we
steamed
slowly
down
to
santiago
here
we
disembarked
just
as
we
had
embarked
different
parts
of
different
outfits
were
jumbled
together
and
it
was
no
light
labor
afterwards
to
assemble
the
various
batteries
for
instance
one
transport
had
guns
and
another
the
locks
for
the
guns
the
two
not
getting
together
for
several
days
after
one
of
them
had
been
landed
soldiers
went
here
provisions
there
and
who
got
ashore
first
largely
depended
upon
individual
activity
fortunately
for
us
my
former
naval
aide
when
i
had
been
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
sharp
a
fellow
was
there
in
command
of
a
little
ship
to
which
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
him
appointed
before
i
left
the
navy
department
he
gave
us
a
black
pilot
who
took
our
transport
right
in
shore
the
others
following
like
a
flock
of
sheep
and
we
disembarked
with
our
rifles
ammunition
belts
and
not
much
else
in
theory
it
was
out
of
our
turn
but
if
we
had
not
disembarked
then
heaven
only
knows
when
our
turn
would
have
come
and
we
did
not
intend
to
be
out
of
the
fighting
if
we
could
help
it
i
carried
some
food
in
my
pockets
and
a
light
waterproof
coat
which
was
my
sole
camp
equipment
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
hours
after
getting
ashore
we
marched
from
daiquiri
where
we
had
landed
to
siboney
also
on
the
coast
reaching
it
during
a
terrific
downpour
of
rain
when
this
was
over
we
built
a
fire
dried
our
clothes
and
ate
whatever
we
had
brought
with
us
we
were
brigaded
with
the
first
and
tenth
regular
cavalry
under
sam
young
he
was
a
fine
type
of
the
american
regular
like
general
chaffee
another
of
the
same
type
he
had
entered
the
army
in
the
civil
war
as
a
private
later
when
i
was
president
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
make
each
of
them
in
succession
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
when
general
young
retired
and
general
chaffee
was
to
take
his
place
the
former
sent
to
the
latter
his
three
stars
to
wear
on
his
first
official
presentation
with
a
note
that
they
were
from
private
young
to
private
chaffee
the
two
fine
old
fellows
had
served
in
the
ranks
one
in
the
cavalry
one
in
the
infantry
in
their
golden
youth
in
the
days
of
the
great
war
nearly
half
a
century
before
each
had
grown
gray
in
a
lifetime
of
honorable
service
under
the
flag
and
each
closed
his
active
career
in
command
of
the
army
general
young
was
one
of
the
few
men
who
had
given
and
taken
wounds
with
the
saber
he
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
when
in
washington
before
starting
for
the
front
he
told
me
that
if
we
got
in
his
brigade
he
would
put
us
into
the
fighting
all
right
he
kept
his
word
general
young
had
actively
superintended
getting
his
two
regular
regiments
or
at
least
a
squadron
of
each
off
the
transports
and
late
that
night
he
sent
us
word
that
he
had
received
permission
to
move
at
dawn
and
strike
the
spanish
advance
position
he
directed
us
to
move
along
a
ridge
trail
with
our
two
squadrons
one
squadron
having
been
left
at
tampa
while
with
the
two
squadrons
of
regulars
one
of
the
first
and
one
of
the
tenth
under
his
personal
supervision
he
marched
up
the
valley
trail
accordingly
wood
took
us
along
the
hill
trail
early
next
morning
till
we
struck
the
spaniards
and
began
our
fight
just
as
the
regulars
began
the
fight
in
the
valley
trail
it
was
a
mountainous
country
covered
with
thick
jungle
a
most
confusing
country
and
i
had
an
awful
time
trying
to
get
into
the
fight
and
trying
to
do
what
was
right
when
in
it
and
all
the
while
i
was
thinking
that
i
was
the
only
man
who
did
not
know
what
i
was
about
and
that
all
the
others
did
whereas
as
i
found
out
later
pretty
much
everybody
else
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
i
was
there
was
no
surprise
we
struck
the
spaniards
exactly
where
we
had
expected
then
wood
halted
us
and
put
us
into
the
fight
deliberately
and
in
order
he
ordered
us
to
deploy
alternately
by
troops
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
trail
giving
our
senior
major
brodie
a
west
pointer
and
as
good
a
soldier
as
ever
wore
a
uniform
the
left
wing
while
i
took
the
right
wing
i
was
told
if
possible
to
connect
with
the
regulars
who
were
on
the
right
in
theory
this
was
excellent
but
as
the
jungle
was
very
dense
the
first
troop
that
deployed
to
the
right
vanished
forthwith
and
i
never
saw
it
again
until
the
fight
was
over
having
a
frightful
feeling
meanwhile
that
i
might
be
for
losing
it
the
next
troop
deployed
to
the
left
under
brodie
then
the
third
came
along
and
i
started
to
deploy
it
to
the
right
as
before
by
the
time
the
first
platoon
had
gotten
into
the
jungle
i
realized
that
it
likewise
would
disappear
unless
i
kept
hold
of
it
i
managed
to
keep
possession
of
the
last
platoon
one
learns
fast
in
a
fight
and
i
marched
this
platoon
and
my
next
two
troops
in
column
through
the
jungle
without
any
attempt
to
deploy
until
we
got
on
the
firing
line
this
sounds
simple
but
it
was
not
i
did
not
know
when
i
had
gotten
on
the
firing
line
i
could
hear
a
good
deal
of
firing
some
over
to
my
right
at
a
good
distance
and
the
rest
to
the
left
and
ahead
i
pushed
on
expecting
to
strike
the
enemy
somewhere
between
soon
we
came
to
the
brink
of
a
deep
valley
there
was
a
good
deal
of
cracking
of
rifles
way
off
in
front
of
us
but
as
they
used
smokeless
powder
we
had
no
idea
as
to
exactly
where
they
were
or
who
they
were
shooting
at
then
it
dawned
on
us
that
we
were
the
target
the
bullets
began
to
come
overhead
making
a
sound
like
the
ripping
of
a
silk
dress
with
sometimes
a
kind
of
pop
a
few
of
my
men
fell
and
i
deployed
the
rest
making
them
lie
down
and
get
behind
trees
richard
harding
davis
was
with
us
and
as
we
scanned
the
landscape
with
our
glasses
it
was
he
who
first
pointed
out
to
us
some
spaniards
in
a
trench
some
of
a
mile
off
it
was
difficult
to
make
them
out
there
were
not
many
of
them
however
we
finally
did
make
them
out
and
we
could
see
their
conical
hats
for
the
trench
was
a
poor
one
we
advanced
firing
at
them
and
drove
them
off
what
to
do
then
i
had
not
an
idea
the
country
in
front
fell
away
into
a
very
difficult
valley
there
was
nothing
but
jungle
all
around
and
if
i
advanced
i
was
afraid
i
might
get
out
of
touch
with
everybody
and
not
be
going
in
the
right
direction
moreover
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
was
now
nobody
in
front
who
was
shooting
at
us
although
some
of
the
men
on
my
left
insisted
that
our
own
men
had
fired
into
us
an
allegation
which
i
soon
found
was
almost
always
made
in
such
a
fight
and
which
in
this
case
was
not
true
at
this
moment
some
of
the
regulars
appeared
across
the
ravine
on
our
right
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
fire
a
volley
at
us
but
one
of
our
first
sergeants
went
up
a
tree
and
waved
a
guidon
at
them
and
they
stopped
firing
was
still
going
on
to
our
left
however
and
i
was
never
more
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
i
did
not
wish
to
take
my
men
out
of
their
position
without
orders
for
fear
that
i
might
thereby
be
leaving
a
gap
if
there
was
a
spanish
force
which
meditated
an
offensive
return
on
the
other
hand
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
i
had
been
doing
enough
fighting
to
justify
my
existence
and
there
was
obviously
fighting
going
on
to
the
left
i
remember
that
i
kept
thinking
of
the
refrain
of
the
song
here
to
every
friend
who
struggled
to
the
end
in
the
hunting
field
i
had
always
acted
on
this
theory
and
no
matter
how
discouraging
appearances
might
be
had
never
stopped
trying
to
get
in
at
the
death
until
the
hunt
was
actually
over
and
now
that
there
was
work
and
not
play
on
hand
i
intended
to
struggle
as
hard
as
i
knew
how
not
to
be
left
out
of
any
fighting
into
which
i
could
with
any
possible
propriety
get
so
i
left
my
men
where
they
were
and
started
off
at
a
trot
toward
where
the
firing
was
with
a
couple
of
orderlies
to
send
back
for
the
men
in
case
that
proved
advisable
like
most
tyros
i
was
wearing
my
sword
which
in
thick
jungle
now
and
then
got
between
my
legs
from
that
day
on
it
always
went
corded
in
the
baggage
i
struck
the
trail
and
began
to
pass
occasional
dead
men
pretty
soon
i
reached
wood
and
found
much
to
my
pleasure
that
i
had
done
the
right
thing
for
as
i
came
up
word
was
brought
to
him
that
brodie
had
been
shot
and
he
at
once
sent
me
to
take
charge
of
the
left
wing
it
was
more
open
country
here
and
at
least
i
was
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
my
own
men
and
exercise
some
control
over
them
there
was
much
firing
going
on
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
see
any
spaniards
and
neither
could
any
one
else
finally
we
made
up
our
minds
that
they
were
shooting
at
us
from
a
set
of
ranch
buildings
a
good
way
in
front
and
these
i
assaulted
finally
charging
them
before
we
came
anywhere
near
the
spaniards
who
as
it
proved
really
were
inside
and
around
them
abandoned
them
leaving
a
few
dead
men
by
the
time
i
had
taken
possession
of
these
buildings
all
firing
had
ceased
everywhere
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
had
happened
whether
the
fight
was
over
or
whether
this
was
merely
a
lull
in
the
fight
or
where
the
spaniards
were
or
whether
we
might
be
attacked
again
or
whether
we
ought
ourselves
to
attack
somebody
somewhere
else
i
got
my
men
in
order
and
sent
out
small
parties
to
explore
the
ground
in
front
who
returned
without
finding
any
foe
by
this
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
spaniards
were
in
full
retreat
meanwhile
i
was
extending
my
line
so
as
to
get
into
touch
with
our
people
on
the
right
word
was
brought
to
me
that
wood
had
been
shot
which
fortunately
proved
not
to
be
true
and
as
if
this
were
so
it
meant
that
i
must
take
charge
of
the
regiment
i
moved
over
personally
to
inquire
soon
i
learned
that
he
was
all
right
that
the
spaniards
had
retreated
along
the
main
road
and
that
colonel
wood
and
two
or
three
other
officers
were
a
short
distance
away
before
i
reached
them
i
encountered
a
captain
of
the
ninth
cavalry
very
glum
because
his
troopers
had
not
been
up
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
fight
and
he
congratulated
me
with
visible
effort
upon
my
share
in
our
first
victory
i
thanked
him
cordially
not
confiding
in
him
that
till
that
moment
i
myself
knew
exceeding
little
about
the
victory
and
proceeded
to
where
generals
wheeler
lawton
and
chaffee
who
had
just
come
up
in
company
with
wood
were
seated
on
a
bank
they
expressed
appreciation
of
the
way
that
i
had
handled
my
troops
first
on
the
right
wing
and
then
on
the
left
as
i
was
quite
prepared
to
find
i
had
committed
some
awful
sin
i
did
my
best
to
accept
this
in
a
nonchalant
manner
and
not
to
look
as
relieved
as
i
felt
as
throughout
the
morning
i
had
preserved
a
specious
aspect
of
wisdom
and
had
commanded
first
one
and
then
the
other
wing
the
fight
was
really
a
capital
thing
for
me
for
practically
all
the
men
had
served
under
my
actual
command
and
thenceforth
felt
an
enthusiastic
belief
that
i
would
lead
them
aright
it
was
a
week
after
this
skirmish
before
the
army
made
the
advance
on
santiago
just
before
this
occurred
general
young
was
stricken
down
with
fever
general
wheeler
who
had
commanded
the
cavalry
division
was
put
in
general
charge
of
the
left
wing
of
the
army
which
fought
before
the
city
itself
sam
sumner
an
excellent
officer
who
had
the
second
cavalry
brigade
took
command
of
the
cavalry
division
and
wood
took
command
of
our
brigade
while
to
my
intense
delight
i
got
my
regiment
i
therefore
had
command
of
the
regiment
before
the
stiffest
fighting
occurred
later
when
wood
was
put
in
command
in
santiago
i
became
the
brigade
commander
late
in
the
evening
we
camped
at
el
poso
there
were
two
regular
officers
the
brigade
commander
aides
lieutenants
mills
and
shipp
who
were
camped
by
our
regiment
each
of
my
men
had
food
in
his
haversack
but
i
had
none
and
i
would
have
gone
supperless
to
bed
if
mills
and
shipp
had
not
given
me
out
of
their
scanty
stores
a
big
sandwich
which
i
shared
with
my
orderly
who
also
had
nothing
next
morning
my
body
servant
marshall
an
of
the
ninth
colored
cavalry
a
fine
and
faithful
fellow
had
turned
up
and
i
was
able
in
my
turn
to
ask
mills
and
shipp
who
had
eaten
all
their
food
the
preceding
evening
to
take
breakfast
with
me
a
few
hours
later
gallant
shipp
was
dead
and
mills
an
exceptionally
able
officer
had
been
shot
through
the
head
from
side
to
side
just
back
of
the
eyes
yet
he
lived
although
one
eye
was
blinded
and
before
i
left
the
presidency
i
gave
him
his
commission
as
early
in
the
morning
our
artillery
began
firing
from
the
immediately
in
front
of
where
our
men
were
camped
several
of
the
regiment
were
killed
and
wounded
by
the
shrapnel
of
the
return
fire
of
the
spaniards
one
of
the
shrapnel
bullets
fell
on
my
wrist
and
raised
a
bump
as
big
as
a
hickory
nut
but
did
not
even
break
the
skin
then
we
were
marched
down
from
the
hill
on
a
muddy
road
through
thick
jungle
towards
santiago
the
heat
was
great
and
we
strolled
into
the
fight
with
no
definite
idea
on
the
part
of
any
one
as
to
what
we
were
to
do
or
what
would
happen
there
was
no
plan
that
our
left
wing
was
to
make
a
serious
fight
that
day
and
as
there
were
no
plans
it
was
naturally
exceedingly
hard
to
get
orders
and
each
of
us
had
to
act
largely
on
his
own
responsibility
lawton
infantry
division
attacked
the
little
village
of
el
caney
some
miles
to
the
right
kent
infantry
division
and
sumner
dismounted
cavalry
division
were
supposed
to
detain
the
spanish
army
in
santiago
until
lawton
had
captured
el
caney
spanish
towns
and
villages
however
with
their
massive
buildings
are
natural
fortifications
as
the
french
found
in
the
peninsular
war
and
as
both
the
french
and
our
people
found
in
mexico
the
spanish
troops
in
el
caney
fought
very
bravely
as
did
the
spanish
troops
in
front
of
us
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
lawton
accomplished
his
task
meanwhile
we
of
the
left
wing
had
by
degrees
become
involved
in
a
fight
which
toward
the
end
became
not
even
a
colonel
fight
but
a
squad
leader
fight
the
cavalry
division
was
put
at
the
head
of
the
line
we
were
told
to
march
forward
cross
a
little
river
in
front
and
then
turning
to
the
right
march
up
alongside
the
stream
until
we
connected
with
lawton
incidentally
this
movement
would
not
have
brought
us
into
touch
with
lawton
in
any
event
but
we
speedily
had
to
abandon
any
thought
of
carrying
it
out
the
maneuver
brought
us
within
fair
range
of
the
spanish
intrenchments
along
the
line
of
hills
which
we
called
the
san
juan
hills
because
on
one
of
them
was
the
san
juan
blockhouse
on
that
day
my
regiment
had
the
lead
of
the
second
brigade
and
we
marched
down
the
trail
following
in
trace
behind
the
first
brigade
apparently
the
spaniards
could
not
make
up
their
minds
what
to
do
as
the
three
regular
regiments
of
the
first
brigade
crossed
and
defiled
along
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
but
when
our
regiment
was
crossing
they
began
to
fire
at
us
under
this
flank
fire
it
soon
became
impossible
to
continue
the
march
the
first
brigade
halted
deployed
and
finally
began
to
fire
back
then
our
brigade
was
halted
from
time
to
time
some
of
our
men
would
fall
and
i
sent
repeated
word
to
the
rear
to
try
to
get
authority
to
attack
the
hills
in
front
finally
general
sumner
who
was
fighting
the
division
in
fine
shape
sent
word
to
advance
the
word
was
brought
to
me
by
mills
who
said
that
my
orders
were
to
support
the
regulars
in
the
assault
on
the
hills
and
that
my
objective
would
be
the
in
front
on
a
hill
which
we
afterwards
christened
kettle
hill
i
mention
mills
saying
this
because
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
definite
order
the
giving
of
which
does
so
much
to
insure
success
in
a
fight
as
it
prevents
all
obscurity
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
the
order
to
attack
did
not
reach
the
first
brigade
until
after
we
ourselves
reached
it
so
that
at
first
there
was
doubt
on
the
part
of
their
officers
whether
they
were
at
liberty
to
join
in
the
advance
i
had
not
enjoyed
the
guasimas
fight
at
all
because
i
had
been
so
uncertain
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
but
the
san
juan
fight
was
entirely
different
the
spaniards
had
a
hard
position
to
attack
it
is
true
but
we
could
see
them
and
i
knew
exactly
how
to
proceed
i
kept
on
horseback
merely
because
i
found
it
difficult
to
convey
orders
along
the
line
as
the
men
were
lying
down
and
it
is
always
hard
to
get
men
to
start
when
they
can
not
see
whether
their
comrades
are
also
going
so
i
rode
up
and
down
the
lines
keeping
them
straightened
out
and
gradually
worked
through
line
after
line
until
i
found
myself
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
lines
of
the
regulars
of
the
first
brigade
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
silly
to
stay
in
the
valley
firing
at
the
hills
because
that
was
really
where
we
were
most
exposed
and
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
try
to
rush
the
intrenchments
where
i
struck
the
regulars
there
was
no
one
of
superior
rank
to
mine
and
after
asking
why
they
did
not
charge
and
being
answered
that
they
had
no
orders
i
said
i
would
give
the
order
there
was
naturally
a
little
reluctance
shown
by
the
elderly
officer
in
command
to
accept
my
order
so
i
said
then
let
my
men
through
sir
and
i
marched
through
followed
by
my
grinning
men
the
younger
officers
and
the
enlisted
men
of
the
regulars
jumped
up
and
joined
us
i
waved
my
hat
and
we
went
up
the
hill
with
a
rush
having
taken
it
we
looked
across
at
the
spaniards
in
the
trenches
under
the
san
juan
blockhouse
to
our
left
which
hawkins
brigade
was
assaulting
i
ordered
our
men
to
open
fire
on
the
spaniards
in
the
trenches
memory
plays
funny
tricks
in
such
a
fight
where
things
happen
quickly
and
all
kinds
of
mental
images
succeed
one
another
in
a
detached
kind
of
way
while
the
work
goes
on
as
i
gave
the
order
in
question
there
slipped
through
my
mind
mahan
account
of
nelson
orders
that
each
ship
as
it
sailed
forward
if
it
saw
another
ship
engaged
with
an
enemy
ship
should
rake
the
latter
as
it
passed
when
soldiers
captured
the
blockhouse
i
very
much
elated
ordered
a
charge
on
my
own
hook
to
a
line
of
hills
still
farther
on
hardly
anybody
heard
this
order
however
only
four
men
started
with
me
three
of
whom
were
shot
i
gave
one
of
them
who
was
only
wounded
my
canteen
of
water
and
ran
back
much
irritated
that
i
had
not
been
followed
which
was
quite
unjustifiable
because
i
found
that
nobody
had
heard
my
orders
general
sumner
had
come
up
by
this
time
and
i
asked
his
permission
to
lead
the
charge
he
ordered
me
to
do
so
and
this
time
away
we
went
and
stormed
the
spanish
intrenchments
there
was
some
close
fighting
and
we
took
a
few
prisoners
we
also
captured
the
spanish
provisions
and
ate
them
that
night
with
great
relish
one
of
the
items
was
salted
by
the
way
there
were
also
bottles
of
wine
and
jugs
of
fiery
spirit
and
as
soon
as
possible
i
had
these
broken
although
not
before
one
or
two
of
my
men
had
taken
too
much
liquor
lieutenant
howze
of
the
regulars
an
aide
of
general
sumner
brought
me
an
order
to
halt
where
i
was
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
return
until
he
had
spent
an
hour
or
two
with
us
under
fire
the
spaniards
attempted
a
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
but
were
driven
back
without
effort
our
men
laughing
and
cheering
as
they
rose
to
fire
because
hitherto
they
had
been
assaulting
breastworks
or
lying
still
under
artillery
fire
and
they
were
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
shoot
at
the
spaniards
in
the
open
we
lay
on
our
arms
that
night
and
as
we
were
drenched
with
sweat
and
had
no
blankets
save
a
few
we
took
from
the
dead
spaniards
we
found
even
the
tropic
night
chilly
before
morning
came
during
the
afternoon
fighting
while
i
was
the
highest
officer
at
our
immediate
part
of
the
front
captains
boughton
and
morton
of
the
regular
cavalry
two
as
fine
officers
as
any
man
could
wish
to
have
beside
him
in
battle
came
along
the
firing
line
to
tell
me
that
they
had
heard
a
rumor
that
we
might
fall
back
and
that
they
wished
to
record
their
emphatic
protest
against
any
such
course
i
did
not
believe
there
was
any
truth
in
the
rumor
for
the
spaniards
were
utterly
incapable
of
any
effective
however
late
in
the
evening
after
the
fight
general
wheeler
visited
us
at
the
front
and
he
told
me
to
keep
myself
in
readiness
as
at
any
moment
it
might
be
decided
to
fall
back
jack
greenway
was
beside
me
when
general
wheeler
was
speaking
i
answered
well
general
i
really
do
know
whether
we
would
obey
an
order
to
fall
back
we
can
take
that
city
by
a
rush
and
if
we
have
to
move
out
of
here
at
all
i
should
be
inclined
to
make
the
rush
in
the
right
direction
greenway
nodded
an
eager
assent
the
old
general
after
a
moment
pause
expressed
his
hearty
agreement
and
said
that
he
would
see
that
there
was
no
falling
back
he
had
been
very
sick
for
a
couple
of
days
but
sick
as
he
was
he
managed
to
get
into
the
fight
he
was
a
gamecock
if
ever
there
was
one
but
he
was
in
very
bad
physical
shape
on
the
day
of
the
fight
if
there
had
been
any
one
in
high
command
to
supervise
and
press
the
attack
that
afternoon
we
would
have
gone
right
into
santiago
in
my
part
of
the
line
the
advance
was
halted
only
because
we
received
orders
not
to
move
forward
but
to
stay
on
the
crest
of
the
captured
hill
and
hold
it
we
are
always
told
that
courage
is
the
most
desirable
kind
well
my
men
and
the
regulars
of
the
cavalry
had
just
that
brand
of
courage
at
about
three
on
the
morning
after
the
first
fight
shooting
began
in
our
front
and
there
was
an
alarm
of
a
spanish
advance
i
was
never
more
pleased
than
to
see
the
way
in
which
the
hungry
tired
shabby
men
all
jumped
up
and
ran
forward
to
the
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
attack
which
however
did
not
come
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
the
spaniards
again
opened
upon
us
with
artillery
a
shell
burst
between
dave
goodrich
and
myself
blacking
us
with
powder
and
killing
and
wounding
several
of
the
men
immediately
behind
us
next
day
the
fight
turned
into
a
siege
there
were
some
stirring
incidents
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
trench
work
a
fortnight
later
santiago
surrendered
wood
won
his
by
the
capital
way
in
which
he
handled
his
brigade
in
the
fight
and
in
the
following
siege
he
was
put
in
command
of
the
captured
city
and
in
a
few
days
i
succeeded
to
the
command
of
the
brigade
the
health
of
the
troops
was
not
good
and
speedily
became
very
bad
there
was
some
dysentery
and
a
little
yellow
fever
but
most
of
the
trouble
was
from
a
severe
form
of
malarial
fever
the
washington
authorities
had
behaved
better
than
those
in
actual
command
of
the
expedition
at
one
crisis
immediately
after
the
first
day
fighting
around
santiago
the
latter
had
hinted
by
cable
to
washington
that
they
might
like
to
withdraw
and
washington
had
emphatically
vetoed
the
proposal
i
record
this
all
the
more
gladly
because
there
were
not
too
many
gleams
of
good
sense
shown
in
the
home
management
of
the
war
although
i
wish
to
repeat
that
the
real
blame
for
this
rested
primarily
with
us
ourselves
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
had
for
years
pursued
in
military
matters
a
policy
that
rendered
it
certain
that
there
would
be
ineptitude
and
failure
in
high
places
if
ever
a
crisis
came
after
the
siege
the
people
in
washington
showed
no
knowledge
whatever
of
the
conditions
around
santiago
and
proposed
to
keep
the
army
there
this
would
have
meant
that
at
least
of
the
men
would
either
have
died
or
have
been
permanently
invalided
as
a
virulent
form
of
malaria
was
widespread
and
there
was
a
steady
growth
of
dysentery
and
other
complaints
no
object
of
any
kind
was
to
be
gained
by
keeping
the
army
in
or
near
the
captured
city
general
shafter
tried
his
best
to
get
the
washington
authorities
to
order
the
army
home
as
he
failed
to
accomplish
anything
he
called
a
council
of
the
division
and
brigade
commanders
and
the
chief
medical
officers
to
consult
over
the
situation
although
i
had
command
of
a
brigade
i
was
only
a
colonel
and
so
i
did
not
intend
to
attend
but
the
general
informed
me
that
i
was
particularly
wanted
and
accordingly
i
went
at
the
council
general
shafter
asked
the
medical
authorities
as
to
conditions
and
they
united
in
informing
him
that
they
were
very
bad
and
were
certain
to
grow
much
worse
and
that
in
order
to
avoid
frightful
ravages
from
disease
chiefly
due
to
malaria
the
army
should
be
sent
back
at
once
to
some
part
of
the
northern
united
states
the
general
then
explained
that
he
could
not
get
the
war
department
to
understand
the
situation
that
he
could
not
get
the
attention
of
the
public
and
that
he
felt
that
there
should
be
some
authoritative
publication
which
would
make
the
war
department
take
action
before
it
was
too
late
to
avert
the
ruin
of
the
army
all
who
were
in
the
room
expressed
their
agreement
then
the
reason
for
my
being
present
came
out
it
was
explained
to
me
by
general
shafter
and
by
others
that
as
i
was
a
volunteer
officer
and
intended
immediately
to
return
to
civil
life
i
could
afford
to
take
risks
which
the
regular
army
men
could
not
afford
to
take
and
ought
not
to
be
expected
to
take
and
that
therefore
i
ought
to
make
the
publication
in
question
because
to
incur
the
hostility
of
the
war
department
would
not
make
any
difference
to
me
whereas
it
would
be
destructive
to
the
men
in
the
regular
army
or
to
those
who
hoped
to
get
into
the
regular
army
i
thought
this
true
and
said
i
would
write
a
letter
or
make
a
statement
which
could
then
be
published
ames
who
was
in
the
same
position
that
i
was
also
announced
that
he
would
make
a
statement
when
i
left
the
meeting
it
was
understood
that
i
was
to
make
my
statement
as
an
interview
in
the
press
but
wood
who
was
by
that
time
commanding
the
city
of
santiago
gave
me
a
quiet
hint
to
put
my
statement
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
general
shafter
and
this
i
accordingly
did
when
i
had
written
my
letter
the
correspondent
of
the
associated
press
who
had
been
informed
by
others
of
what
had
occurred
accompanied
me
to
general
shafter
i
presented
the
letter
to
general
shafter
who
waved
it
away
and
said
i
do
want
to
take
it
do
whatever
you
wish
with
it
i
however
insisted
on
handing
it
to
him
whereupon
he
shoved
it
toward
the
correspondent
of
the
associated
press
who
took
hold
of
it
and
i
released
my
hold
general
ames
made
a
statement
direct
to
the
correspondent
and
also
sent
a
cable
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
at
washington
a
copy
of
which
he
gave
to
the
correspondent
by
this
time
the
other
division
and
brigade
commanders
who
were
present
felt
that
they
had
better
take
action
themselves
they
united
in
a
round
robin
to
general
shafter
which
general
wood
dictated
and
which
was
signed
by
generals
kent
gates
chaffee
sumner
ludlow
ames
and
wood
and
by
myself
general
wood
handed
this
to
general
shafter
and
it
was
made
public
by
general
shafter
precisely
as
mine
was
made
public
later
i
was
much
amused
when
general
shafter
stated
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
my
letter
and
the
round
robin
got
out
when
i
saw
this
statement
i
appreciated
how
wise
wood
had
been
in
hinting
to
me
not
to
act
on
the
suggestion
of
the
general
that
i
should
make
a
statement
to
the
newspapers
but
to
put
my
statement
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
him
as
my
superior
officer
a
letter
which
i
delivered
to
him
both
the
letter
and
the
round
robin
were
written
at
general
shafter
wish
and
at
the
unanimous
suggestion
of
all
the
commanding
and
medical
officers
of
the
fifth
army
corps
and
both
were
published
by
general
shafter
general
wood
writes
me
the
representative
of
the
associated
press
was
very
anxious
to
get
a
copy
of
this
despatch
or
see
it
and
i
told
him
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
have
it
or
see
it
i
then
went
in
to
general
shafter
and
stated
the
case
to
him
handing
him
the
despatch
saying
matter
is
now
in
your
hands
he
general
shafter
then
said
do
care
whether
this
gentleman
has
it
or
not
and
i
left
then
when
i
went
back
the
general
told
me
he
had
given
the
press
representative
a
copy
of
the
despatch
and
that
he
had
gone
to
the
office
with
it
in
a
regiment
the
prime
need
is
to
have
fighting
men
the
prime
virtue
is
to
be
able
and
eager
to
fight
with
the
utmost
effectiveness
i
have
never
believed
that
this
was
incompatible
with
other
virtues
on
the
contrary
while
there
are
of
course
exceptions
i
believe
that
on
the
average
the
best
fighting
men
are
also
the
best
citizens
i
do
not
believe
that
a
finer
set
of
natural
soldiers
than
the
men
of
my
regiment
could
have
been
found
anywhere
and
they
were
citizens
in
civil
life
also
one
fact
may
perhaps
be
worthy
of
note
whenever
we
were
in
camp
and
so
fixed
that
we
could
have
regular
meals
we
used
to
have
a
general
officers
mess
over
which
i
of
course
presided
during
our
entire
service
there
was
never
a
foul
or
indecent
word
uttered
at
the
officers
mess
i
mean
this
literally
and
there
was
very
little
swearing
although
now
and
then
in
the
fighting
if
there
was
a
moment
when
swearing
seemed
to
be
the
best
method
of
reaching
the
heart
of
the
matter
it
was
resorted
to
the
men
i
cared
for
most
in
the
regiment
were
the
men
who
did
the
best
work
and
therefore
my
liking
for
them
was
obliged
to
take
the
shape
of
exposing
them
to
the
most
fatigue
and
hardship
of
demanding
from
them
the
greatest
service
and
of
making
them
incur
the
greatest
risk
once
i
kept
greenway
and
goodrich
at
work
for
hours
without
sleeping
and
with
very
little
food
fighting
and
digging
trenches
i
freely
sent
the
men
for
whom
i
cared
most
to
where
death
might
smite
them
and
death
often
smote
them
as
it
did
the
two
best
officers
in
my
regiment
allyn
capron
and
bucky
my
men
would
not
have
respected
me
had
i
acted
otherwise
their
creed
was
my
creed
the
life
even
of
the
most
useful
man
of
the
best
citizen
is
not
to
be
hoarded
if
there
be
need
to
spend
it
i
felt
and
feel
this
about
others
and
of
course
also
about
myself
this
is
one
reason
why
i
have
always
felt
impatient
contempt
for
the
effort
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
on
account
of
sympathy
with
criminals
i
am
willing
to
listen
to
arguments
in
favor
of
abolishing
the
death
penalty
so
far
as
they
are
based
purely
on
grounds
of
public
expediency
although
these
arguments
have
never
convinced
me
but
inasmuch
as
without
hesitation
in
the
performance
of
duty
i
have
again
and
again
sent
good
and
gallant
and
upright
men
to
die
it
seems
to
me
the
height
of
a
folly
both
mischievous
and
mawkish
to
contend
that
criminals
who
have
deserved
death
should
nevertheless
be
allowed
to
shirk
it
no
brave
and
good
man
can
properly
shirk
death
and
no
criminal
who
has
earned
death
should
be
allowed
to
shirk
it
one
of
the
best
men
with
our
regiment
was
the
british
military
attache
captain
arthur
lee
an
old
friend
the
other
military
attaches
were
herded
together
at
headquarters
and
saw
little
captain
lee
who
had
known
me
in
washington
escaped
and
stayed
with
the
regiment
we
grew
to
feel
that
he
was
one
of
us
and
made
him
an
honorary
member
there
were
two
other
honorary
members
one
was
richard
harding
davis
who
was
with
us
continually
and
who
performed
valuable
service
on
the
fighting
line
the
other
was
a
regular
officer
lieutenant
parker
who
had
a
battery
of
gatlings
we
were
with
this
battery
throughout
the
san
juan
fighting
and
we
grew
to
have
the
strongest
admiration
for
parker
as
a
soldier
and
the
strongest
liking
for
him
as
a
man
during
our
brief
campaign
we
were
closely
and
intimately
thrown
with
various
regular
officers
of
the
type
of
mills
howze
and
parker
we
felt
not
merely
fondness
for
them
as
officers
and
gentlemen
but
pride
in
them
as
americans
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
feel
that
we
have
in
the
army
and
in
the
navy
modest
efficient
gallant
gentlemen
of
this
type
doing
such
disinterested
work
for
the
honor
of
the
flag
and
of
the
nation
no
american
can
overpay
the
debt
of
gratitude
we
all
of
us
owe
to
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
army
and
of
the
navy
of
course
with
a
regiment
of
our
type
there
was
much
to
learn
both
among
the
officers
and
the
men
there
were
all
kinds
of
funny
incidents
one
of
my
men
an
and
former
cook
a
very
good
shot
and
rider
got
into
trouble
on
the
way
down
on
the
transport
he
understood
entirely
that
he
had
to
obey
the
officers
of
his
own
regiment
but
like
so
many
volunteers
or
at
least
like
so
many
volunteers
of
my
regiment
he
did
not
understand
that
this
obligation
extended
to
officers
of
other
regiments
one
of
the
regular
officers
on
the
transport
ordered
him
to
do
something
which
he
declined
to
do
when
the
officer
told
him
to
consider
himself
under
arrest
he
responded
by
offering
to
fight
him
for
a
trifling
consideration
he
was
brought
before
a
court
martial
which
sentenced
him
to
a
year
imprisonment
at
hard
labor
with
dishonorable
discharge
and
the
commanding
the
division
approved
the
sentence
we
were
on
the
transport
there
was
no
hard
labor
to
do
and
the
prison
consisted
of
another
who
kept
guard
over
him
with
his
carbine
evidently
divided
in
his
feelings
as
to
whether
he
would
like
most
to
shoot
him
or
to
let
him
go
when
we
landed
somebody
told
the
prisoner
that
i
intended
to
punish
him
by
keeping
him
with
the
baggage
he
at
once
came
to
me
in
great
agitation
saying
colonel
they
say
you
going
to
leave
me
with
the
baggage
when
the
fight
is
on
colonel
if
you
do
that
i
will
never
show
my
face
in
arizona
again
colonel
if
you
will
let
me
go
to
the
front
i
promise
i
will
obey
any
one
you
say
any
one
you
say
colonel
with
the
evident
feeling
that
after
this
concession
i
could
not
as
a
gentleman
refuse
his
request
accordingly
i
answered
shields
there
is
no
one
in
this
regiment
more
entitled
to
be
shot
than
you
are
and
you
shall
go
to
the
front
his
gratitude
was
great
and
he
kept
repeating
i
never
forget
this
colonel
never
nor
did
he
when
we
got
very
hard
up
he
would
now
and
then
manage
to
get
hold
of
some
flour
and
sugar
and
would
cook
a
doughnut
and
bring
it
round
to
me
and
watch
me
with
a
delighted
smile
as
i
ate
it
he
behaved
extremely
well
in
both
fights
and
after
the
second
one
i
had
him
formally
before
me
and
remitted
his
sentence
something
which
of
course
i
had
not
the
slightest
power
to
do
although
at
the
time
it
seemed
natural
and
proper
to
me
when
we
came
to
be
mustered
out
the
regular
officer
who
was
doing
the
mustering
after
all
the
men
had
been
discharged
finally
asked
me
where
the
prisoner
was
i
said
what
prisoner
he
said
the
prisoner
the
man
who
was
sentenced
to
a
year
imprisonment
with
hard
labor
and
dishonorable
discharge
i
said
oh
i
pardoned
him
to
which
he
responded
i
beg
your
pardon
you
did
what
this
made
me
grasp
the
fact
that
i
had
exceeded
authority
and
i
could
only
answer
well
i
did
pardon
him
anyhow
and
he
has
gone
with
the
rest
whereupon
the
officer
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
remarked
he
was
sentenced
by
a
court
martial
and
the
sentence
was
approved
by
the
commanding
the
division
you
were
a
and
you
pardoned
him
well
it
was
nervy
that
all
i
say
the
simple
fact
was
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
enforce
discipline
and
control
the
regiment
and
therefore
to
reward
and
punish
individuals
in
whatever
way
the
exigencies
demanded
i
often
explained
to
the
men
what
the
reasons
for
an
order
were
the
first
time
it
was
issued
if
there
was
any
trouble
on
their
part
in
understanding
what
they
were
required
to
do
they
were
very
intelligent
and
very
eager
to
do
their
duty
and
i
hardly
ever
had
any
difficulty
the
second
time
with
them
if
however
there
was
the
slightest
willful
shirking
of
duty
or
insubordination
i
punished
instantly
and
mercilessly
and
the
whole
regiment
cordially
backed
me
up
to
have
punished
men
for
faults
and
shortcomings
which
they
had
no
opportunity
to
know
were
such
would
have
been
as
unwise
as
to
have
permitted
any
of
the
occasional
bad
characters
to
exercise
the
slightest
license
it
was
a
regiment
which
was
sensitive
about
its
dignity
and
was
very
keenly
alive
to
justice
and
to
courtesy
but
which
cordially
approved
absence
of
mollycoddling
insistence
upon
the
performance
of
duty
and
summary
punishment
of
in
the
final
fighting
at
san
juan
when
we
captured
one
of
the
trenches
jack
greenway
had
seized
a
spaniard
and
shortly
afterwards
i
found
jack
leading
his
captive
round
with
a
string
i
told
him
to
turn
him
over
to
a
man
who
had
two
or
three
other
captives
so
that
they
should
all
be
taken
to
the
rear
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
jack
look
aggrieved
why
colonel
ca
i
keep
him
for
myself
he
asked
plaintively
i
think
he
had
an
idea
that
as
a
trophy
of
his
bow
and
spear
the
spaniard
would
make
a
fine
body
servant
one
reason
that
we
never
had
the
slightest
trouble
in
the
regiment
was
because
when
we
got
down
to
hard
pan
officers
and
men
shared
exactly
alike
it
is
all
right
to
have
differences
in
food
and
the
like
in
times
of
peace
and
plenty
when
everybody
is
comfortable
but
in
really
hard
times
officers
and
men
must
share
alike
if
the
best
work
is
to
be
done
as
long
as
i
had
nothing
but
two
hardtacks
which
was
the
allowance
to
each
man
on
the
morning
after
the
san
juan
fight
no
one
could
complain
but
if
i
had
had
any
private
little
luxuries
the
men
would
very
naturally
have
realized
keenly
their
own
shortages
soon
after
the
guasimas
fight
we
were
put
on
short
commons
and
as
i
knew
that
a
good
deal
of
food
had
been
landed
and
was
on
the
beach
at
siboney
i
marched
thirty
or
forty
of
the
men
down
to
see
if
i
could
not
get
some
and
bring
it
up
i
finally
found
a
commissary
officer
and
he
asked
me
what
i
wanted
and
i
answered
anything
he
had
so
he
told
me
to
look
about
for
myself
i
found
a
number
of
sacks
of
beans
i
think
about
eleven
hundred
pounds
on
the
beach
and
told
the
officer
that
i
wanted
eleven
hundred
pounds
of
beans
he
produced
a
book
of
regulations
and
showed
me
the
appropriate
section
and
subdivision
which
announced
that
beans
were
issued
only
for
the
officers
mess
this
did
me
no
good
and
i
told
him
so
he
said
he
was
sorry
and
i
answered
that
he
was
not
as
sorry
as
i
was
i
then
studied
on
it
as
rabbit
would
say
and
came
back
with
a
request
for
eleven
hundred
pounds
of
beans
for
the
officers
mess
he
said
why
colonel
your
officers
ca
eat
eleven
hundred
pounds
of
beans
to
which
i
responded
you
do
know
what
appetites
my
officers
have
he
then
said
he
would
send
the
requisition
to
washington
i
told
him
i
was
quite
willing
so
long
as
he
gave
me
the
beans
he
was
a
good
fellow
so
we
finally
effected
a
working
compromise
he
got
the
requisition
and
i
got
the
beans
although
he
warned
me
that
the
price
would
probably
be
deducted
from
my
salary
under
some
regulation
or
other
only
the
regular
supply
trains
were
allowed
to
act
and
we
were
supposed
not
to
have
any
horses
or
mules
in
the
regiment
itself
this
was
very
pretty
in
theory
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
supply
trains
were
not
numerous
enough
my
men
had
a
natural
genius
for
acquiring
horseflesh
in
odd
ways
and
i
continually
found
that
they
had
staked
out
in
the
brush
various
captured
spanish
cavalry
horses
and
cuban
ponies
and
abandoned
commissary
mules
putting
these
together
i
would
organize
a
small
pack
train
and
work
it
industriously
for
a
day
or
two
until
they
learned
about
it
at
headquarters
and
confiscated
it
then
i
would
have
to
wait
for
a
week
or
so
until
my
men
had
accumulated
some
more
ponies
horses
and
mules
the
regiment
meanwhile
living
in
plenty
on
what
we
had
got
before
the
train
was
confiscated
all
of
our
men
were
good
at
accumulating
horses
but
within
our
own
ranks
i
think
we
were
inclined
to
award
the
palm
to
our
chaplain
there
was
not
a
better
man
in
the
regiment
than
the
chaplain
and
there
could
not
have
been
a
better
chaplain
for
our
men
he
took
care
of
the
sick
and
the
wounded
he
never
spared
himself
and
he
did
every
duty
in
addition
he
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
acquiring
mules
which
made
some
admirer
when
the
regiment
was
disbanded
propose
that
we
should
have
a
special
medal
struck
for
him
with
on
the
obverse
a
mule
passant
and
chaplain
regardant
after
the
surrender
of
santiago
a
philadelphia
clergyman
whom
i
knew
came
down
to
general
wheeler
headquarters
and
after
visiting
him
announced
that
he
intended
to
call
on
the
rough
riders
because
he
knew
their
colonel
one
of
general
wheeler
aides
lieutenant
steele
who
liked
us
both
individually
and
as
a
regiment
and
who
appreciated
some
of
our
ways
asked
the
clergyman
after
he
had
announced
that
he
knew
colonel
roosevelt
but
do
you
know
colonel
roosevelt
regiment
no
said
the
clergyman
very
well
then
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
when
you
go
down
to
see
the
colonel
do
let
your
horse
out
of
your
sight
and
if
the
chaplain
is
there
do
get
off
the
horse
we
came
back
to
montauk
point
and
soon
after
were
disbanded
we
had
been
in
the
service
only
a
little
over
four
months
there
are
no
four
months
of
my
life
to
which
i
look
back
with
more
pride
and
satisfaction
i
believe
most
earnestly
and
sincerely
in
peace
but
as
things
are
yet
in
this
world
the
nation
that
can
not
fight
the
people
that
have
lost
the
fighting
edge
that
have
lost
the
virile
virtues
occupy
a
position
as
dangerous
as
it
is
ignoble
the
future
greatness
of
america
in
no
small
degree
depends
upon
the
possession
by
the
average
american
citizen
of
the
qualities
which
my
men
showed
when
they
served
under
me
at
santiago
moreover
there
is
one
thing
in
connection
with
this
war
which
it
is
well
that
our
people
should
remember
our
people
who
genuinely
love
the
peace
of
righteousness
the
peace
of
justice
and
i
would
be
ashamed
to
be
other
than
a
lover
of
the
peace
of
righteousness
and
of
justice
the
true
preachers
of
peace
who
strive
earnestly
to
bring
nearer
the
day
when
peace
shall
obtain
among
all
peoples
and
who
really
do
help
forward
the
cause
are
men
who
never
hesitate
to
choose
righteous
war
when
it
is
the
only
alternative
to
unrighteous
peace
these
are
the
men
who
like
lyman
abbott
have
backed
every
genuine
movement
for
peace
in
this
country
and
who
nevertheless
recognized
our
clear
duty
to
war
for
the
freedom
of
cuba
but
there
are
other
men
who
put
peace
ahead
of
righteousness
and
who
care
so
little
for
facts
that
they
treat
fantastic
declarations
for
immediate
universal
arbitration
as
being
valuable
instead
of
detrimental
to
the
cause
they
profess
to
champion
and
who
seek
to
make
the
united
states
impotent
for
international
good
under
the
pretense
of
making
us
impotent
for
international
evil
all
the
men
of
this
kind
and
all
of
the
organizations
they
have
controlled
since
we
began
our
career
as
a
nation
all
put
together
have
not
accomplished
one
hundredth
part
as
much
for
both
peace
and
righteousness
have
not
done
one
hundredth
part
as
much
either
for
ourselves
or
for
other
peoples
as
was
accomplished
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
when
they
fought
the
war
with
spain
and
with
resolute
good
faith
and
common
sense
worked
out
the
solution
of
the
problems
which
sprang
from
the
war
our
army
and
navy
and
above
all
our
people
learned
some
lessons
from
the
spanish
war
and
applied
them
to
our
own
uses
during
the
following
decade
the
improvement
in
our
navy
and
army
was
very
great
not
in
material
only
but
also
in
personnel
and
above
all
in
the
ability
to
handle
our
forces
in
units
by
when
our
battle
fleet
steamed
round
the
world
the
navy
had
become
in
every
respect
as
fit
a
fighting
instrument
as
any
other
navy
in
the
world
fleet
for
fleet
even
in
size
there
was
but
one
nation
england
which
was
completely
out
of
our
class
and
in
view
of
our
relations
with
england
and
all
the
peoples
this
was
of
no
consequence
of
our
army
of
course
as
much
could
not
be
said
nevertheless
the
improvement
in
efficiency
was
marked
our
artillery
was
still
very
inferior
in
training
and
practice
to
the
artillery
arm
of
any
one
of
the
great
powers
such
as
germany
france
or
japan
a
condition
which
we
only
then
began
to
remedy
but
the
workmanlike
speed
and
efficiency
with
which
the
expedition
of
some
troops
of
all
arms
was
mobilized
and
transported
to
cuba
during
the
revolution
of
showed
that
as
regards
our
cavalry
and
infantry
we
had
at
least
reached
the
point
where
we
could
assemble
and
handle
in
fashion
expeditionary
forces
this
is
mighty
little
to
boast
of
for
a
nation
of
our
wealth
and
population
it
is
not
pleasant
to
compare
it
with
the
extraordinary
feats
of
contemporary
japan
and
the
balkan
peoples
but
such
as
it
is
it
represents
a
long
stride
in
advance
over
conditions
as
they
were
in
appendix
a
a
manly
letter
there
was
a
sequel
to
the
round
robin
incident
which
caused
a
little
stir
at
the
moment
secretary
alger
had
asked
me
to
write
him
freely
from
time
to
time
accordingly
after
the
surrender
of
santiago
i
wrote
him
begging
that
the
cavalry
division
might
be
put
into
the
porto
rican
fighting
preparatory
to
what
we
supposed
would
be
the
big
campaign
against
havana
in
the
fall
in
the
letter
i
extolled
the
merits
of
the
rough
riders
and
of
the
regulars
announcing
with
much
complacency
that
each
of
our
regiments
was
worth
three
of
the
national
guard
regiments
armed
with
their
archaic
black
powder
rifles
secretary
alger
believed
mistakenly
that
i
had
made
public
the
round
robin
and
was
naturally
irritated
and
i
suddenly
received
from
him
a
published
telegram
not
alluding
to
the
round
robin
incident
but
quoting
my
reference
to
the
comparative
merits
of
the
cavalry
regiments
and
the
national
guard
regiments
and
rebuking
me
for
it
the
publication
of
the
extract
from
my
letter
was
not
calculated
to
help
me
secure
the
votes
of
the
national
guard
if
i
ever
became
a
candidate
for
office
however
i
did
not
mind
the
matter
much
for
i
had
at
the
time
no
idea
of
being
a
candidate
for
anything
while
in
the
campaign
i
ate
and
drank
and
thought
and
dreamed
regiment
and
nothing
but
regiment
until
i
got
the
brigade
and
then
i
devoted
all
my
thoughts
to
handling
the
brigade
anyhow
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
about
the
matter
i
quote
this
sentence
from
memory
it
is
substantially
correct
when
our
transport
reached
montauk
point
an
army
officer
came
aboard
and
before
doing
anything
else
handed
me
a
sealed
letter
from
the
secretary
of
war
which
ran
as
follows
war
department
washington
august
dear
roosevelt
you
have
been
a
most
gallant
officer
and
in
the
battle
before
santiago
showed
superb
soldierly
qualities
i
would
rather
add
to
than
detract
from
the
honors
you
have
so
fairly
won
and
i
wish
you
all
good
things
in
a
moment
of
aggravation
under
great
stress
of
feeling
first
because
i
thought
you
spoke
in
a
disparaging
manner
of
the
volunteers
probably
without
intent
but
because
of
your
great
enthusiasm
for
your
own
men
and
second
that
i
believed
your
published
letter
would
embarrass
the
department
i
sent
you
a
telegram
which
with
an
extract
from
a
private
letter
of
yours
i
gave
to
the
press
i
would
gladly
recall
both
if
i
could
but
unable
to
do
that
i
write
you
this
letter
which
i
hope
you
will
receive
in
the
same
friendly
spirit
in
which
i
send
it
come
and
see
me
at
a
very
early
day
no
one
will
welcome
you
more
heartily
than
yours
very
truly
signed
alger
i
thought
this
a
manly
letter
and
paid
no
more
heed
to
the
incident
and
when
i
was
president
and
general
alger
was
senator
from
michigan
he
was
my
stanch
friend
and
on
most
matters
my
supporter
appendix
b
the
san
juan
fight
the
san
juan
fight
took
its
name
from
the
san
juan
hill
or
hills
i
do
not
know
whether
the
name
properly
belonged
to
a
line
of
hills
or
to
only
one
hill
to
compare
small
things
with
large
things
this
was
precisely
as
the
battle
of
gettysburg
took
its
name
from
the
village
of
gettysburg
where
only
a
small
part
of
the
fighting
was
done
and
the
battle
of
waterloo
from
the
village
of
waterloo
where
none
of
the
fighting
was
done
when
it
became
the
political
interest
of
certain
people
to
endeavor
to
minimize
my
part
in
the
santiago
fighting
which
was
merely
like
that
of
various
other
squadron
battalion
and
regimental
commanders
some
of
my
opponents
laid
great
stress
on
the
alleged
fact
that
the
cavalry
did
not
charge
up
san
juan
hill
we
certainly
charged
some
hills
but
i
did
not
ask
their
names
before
charging
them
to
say
that
the
rough
riders
and
the
cavalry
division
and
among
other
people
myself
were
not
in
the
san
juan
fight
is
precisely
like
saying
that
the
men
who
made
charge
or
the
men
who
fought
at

round
top
and
culps

were
not
at
gettysburg

that
picton
and
the
scotch

the

were
not
at
waterloo
the

very

samuel

united

west
point
december
my
dear
colonel
i
saw
you
lead
the
line
up
the
first
hill
you
were
certainly
the
first
officer
to
reach
the
top
and
through
your
efforts
and
your
personally
jumping
to
the
front
a
line
more
or
less
thin
but
strong
enough
to
take
it
was
led
by
you
to
the
san
juan
or
first
hill
in
this
your
life
was
placed
in
extreme
jeopardy
as
you
may
recall
and
as
it
proved
by
the
number
of
dead
left
in
that
vicinity
captain
stevens
then
of
the
ninth
cavalry
now
of
the
second
cavalry
was
with
you
and
i
am
sure
he
recalls
your
gallant
conduct
after
the
line
started
on
the
advance
from
the
first
hill
i
did
not
see
you
until
our
line
was
halted
under
a
most
galling
fire
at
the
extreme
front
where
you
afterwards
entrenched
i
spoke
to
you
there
and
gave
instructions
from
general
sumner
that
the
position
was
to
be
held
and
that
there
would
be
no
further
advance
till
further
orders
you
were
the
senior
officer
there
took
charge
of
the
line
scolded
me
for
having
my
horse
so
high
upon
the
ridge
at
the
same
time
you
were
exposing
yourself
most
conspicuously
while
adjusting
the
line
for
the
example
was
necessary
as
was
proved
when
several
colored
soldiers
about
eight
or
ten
infantry
i
think
started
at
a
run
to
the
rear
to
assist
a
wounded
colored
soldier
and
you
drew
your
revolver
and
put
a
short
and
effective
stop
to
such
apparent
stampede
it
quieted
them
that
position
was
hot
and
now
i
marvel
at
your
escaping
there
very
sincerely
yours
robert
howze
west
point
december
i
hereby
certify
that
on
july
colonel
then
theodore
roosevelt
first
volunteer
cavalry
distinguished
himself
through
the
action
and
on
two
occasions
during
the
battle
when
i
was
an
his
conduct
was
most
conspicuous
and
clearly
distinguished
above
other
men
as
follows
at
the
base
of
san
juan
or
first
hill
there
was
a
strong
wire
fence
or
entanglement
at
which
the
line
hesitated
under
a
galling
fire
and
where
the
losses
were
severe
colonel
roosevelt
jumped
through
the
fence
and
by
his
enthusiasm
his
example
and
courage
succeeded
in
leading
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
a
line
sufficiently
strong
to
capture
it
in
this
charge
the
cavalry
brigade
suffered
its
greatest
loss
and
the
colonel
life
was
placed
in
extreme
jeopardy
owing
to
the
conspicuous
position
he
took
in
leading
the
line
and
being
the
first
to
reach
the
crest
of
that
hill
while
under
heavy
fire
of
the
enemy
at
close
range
at
the
extreme
advanced
position
occupied
by
our
lines
colonel
roosevelt
found
himself
the
senior
and
under
his
instructions
from
general
sumner
to
hold
that
position
he
displayed
the
greatest
bravery
and
placed
his
life
in
extreme
jeopardy
by
unavoidable
exposure
to
severe
fire
while
adjusting
and
strengthening
the
line
placing
the
men
in
positions
which
afforded
best
protection
etc
his
conduct
and
example
steadied
the
men
and
on
one
occasion
by
severe
but
not
unnecessary
measures
prevented
a
small
detachment
from
stampeding
to
the
rear
he
displayed
the
most
conspicuous
gallantry
courage
and
coolness
in
performing
extraordinarily
hazardous
duty

i
have

to
submit
the
following
my
duties
on

brought
me
in
constant
observation
of
and
contact
with
colonel

from
early
morning
until
shortly
before
the
climax
of
the
assault
of
the
cavalry
division
on
the
san

hill
the
kettle

during
this
time
while
under

at

while
on

march
from

by
the
san
juan
ford
to
the
point
from
which
his
regiment
moved
to
the
assault
about
two
miles
the
greater
part
under
fire
colonel
roosevelt
was
conspicuous
above
any
others
i
observed
in
his
regiment
in
the
zealous
performance
of
duty
in
total
disregard
of
his
personal
danger
and
in
his
eagerness
to
meet
the
enemy
at
el
poso
when
the
enemy
opened
on
that
place
with
artillery
fire
a
shrapnel
bullet
grazed
and
bruised
one
of
colonel
roosevelt
wrists
the
incident
did
not
lessen
his
hazardous
exposure
but
he
continued
so
exposed
until
he
had
placed
his
command
under
cover
in
moving
to
the
assault
of
san
juan
hill
colonel
roosevelt
was
most
conspicuously
brave
gallant
and
indifferent
to
his
own
safety
he
in
the
open
led
his
regiment
no
officer
could
have
set
a
more
striking
example
to
his
men
or
displayed
greater

very
respectfully
your

santiago

december
to
the
united

army
washington
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
make
the
following
statement
relative
to
the
conduct
of
colonel
theodore
roosevelt
late
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
during
the
assault
upon
san
juan
hill
july
i
have
already
recommended
this
officer
for
a
medal
of
honor
which
i
understand
has
been
denied
him
upon
the
ground
that
my
previous
letter
was
too
indefinite
i
based
my
recommendation
upon
the
fact
that
colonel
roosevelt
accompanied
only
by
four
or
five
men
led
a
very
desperate
and
extremely
gallant
charge
on
san
juan
hill
thereby
setting
a
splendid
example
to
the
troops
and
encouraging
them
to
pass
over
the
open
country
intervening
between
their
position
and
the
trenches
of
the
enemy
in
leading
this
charge
he
started
off
first
as
he
supposed
with
quite
a
following
of
men
but
soon
discovered
that
he
was
alone
he
then
returned
and
gathered
up
a
few
men
and
led
them
to
the
charge
as
above
stated
the
charge
in
itself
was
an
extremely
gallant
one
and
the
example
set
a
most
inspiring
one
to
the
troops
in
that
part
of
the
line
and
while
it
is
perfectly
true
that
everybody
finally
went
up
the
hill
in
good
style
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
magnificent
example
set
by
colonel
roosevelt
had
a
very
encouraging
effect
and
had
great
weight
in
bringing
up
the
troops
behind
him
during
the
assault
colonel
roosevelt
was
the
first
to
reach
the
trenches
in
his
part
of
the
line
and
killed
one
of
the
enemy
with
his
own
hand
i
earnestly
recommend
that
the
medal
be
conferred
upon
colonel
roosevelt
for
i
believe
that
he
in
every
way
deserves
it
and
that
his
services
on
the
day
in
question
were
of
great
value
and
of
a
most
distinguished
character

hereby
certify
that
on

at

i
witnessed
colonel
then
roosevelt
first
volunteer

mounted
leading
his
regiment
in
the
charge
on

by
his
gallantry
and
strong
personality
he
contributed
most
materially
to
the
success
of
the
charge
of
the
cavalry
division
up
san
juan
hill
colonel
roosevelt
was
among
the
first
to
reach
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
his
dashing
example
his
absolute
fearlessness
and
gallant
leading
rendered
his

young

sir
believing
that
information
relating
to
superior
conduct
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
higher
officers
who
participated
in
the
war
and
which
information
may
not
have
been
given
would
be
appreciated
by
the
department
over
which
you
preside
i
have
the
honor
to
call
your
attention
to
the
part
borne
by
colonel
theodore
roosevelt
of
the
late
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
in
the
battle
of
july
last
i
do
this
not
only
because
i
think
you
ought
to
know
but
because
his
regiment
as
a
whole
were
very
proud
of
his
splendid
actions
that
day
and
believe
they
call
for
that
most
coveted
distinction
of
the
american
officer
the
medal
of
honor
held
in
support
he
brought
his
regiment
at
exactly
the
right
time
not
only
up
to
the
line
of
regulars
but
went
through
them
and
headed
on
horseback
the
charge
on
kettle
hill
this
being
done
on
his
own
initiative
the
regulars
as
well
as
his
own
men
following
he
then
headed
the
charge
on
the
next
hill
both
regulars
and
the
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
following
he
was
so
near
the
intrenchments
on
the
second
hill
that
he
shot
and
killed
with
a
revolver
one
of
the
enemy
before
they
broke
completely
he
then
led
the
cavalry
on
the
chain
of
hills
overlooking
santiago
where
he
remained
in
charge
of
all
the
cavalry
that
was
at
the
extreme
front
for
the
rest
of
that
day
and
night
his
unhesitating
gallantry
in
taking
the
initiative
against
intrenchments
lined
by
men
armed
with
rapid
fire
guns
certainly
won
him
the
highest
consideration
and
admiration
of
all
who
witnessed
his
conduct
throughout
that
day
what
i
here
write
i
can
bear
witness
to
from
personally
having
seen
very
respectfully
jenkins
major
late
first
united
states
cavalry
prescott
december
i
was
colonel
roosevelt
orderly
at
the
battle
of
san
juan
hill
and
from
that
time
on
until
our
return
to
montauk
point
i
was
with
him
all
through
the
fighting
and
believe
i
was
the
only
man
who
was
always
with
him
though
during
part
of
the
time
lieutenants
ferguson
and
greenwald
were
also
close
to
him
he
led
our
regiment
forward
on
horseback
until
he
came
to
the
men
of
the
ninth
cavalry
lying
down
he
led
us
through
these
and
they
got
up
and
joined
us
he
gave
the
order
to
charge
on
kettle
hill
and
led
us
on
horseback
up
the
hill
both
rough
riders
and
the
ninth
cavalry
he
was
the
first
on
the
hill
i
being
very
nearly
alongside
of
him
some
spanish
riflemen
were
coming
out
of
the
intrenchments
and
he
killed
one
with
his
revolver
he
took
the
men
on
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
bade
them
begin
firing
on
the
blockhouse
on
the
hill
to
our
left
the
one
the
infantry
were
attacking
when
he
took
it
he
gave
the
order
to
charge
and
led
the
troops
on
kettle
hill
forward
against
the
blockhouse
on
our
front
he
then
had
charge
of
all
the
cavalry
on
the
hills
overlooking
santiago
where
we
afterwards
dug
our
trenches
he
had
command
that
afternoon
and
night
and
for
the
rest
of
the
time
commanded
our
regiment
at
this
point

theodore

dear
sir
at
your
request
i
send
you
the
following
extracts
from
my
diary
and
from
notes
taken
on
the
day
of
the
assault
on
san
juan
i
kept
in
my
pocket
a
small
pad
on
which
incidents
were
noted
daily
from
the
landing
until
the
surrender
on
the
day
of
the
fight
notes
were
taken
just
before
grimes
fired
his
first
gun
just
after
the
third
reply
from
the
enemy
when
we
were
massed
in
the
road
about
seventy
paces
from
grimes
guns
and
when
i
was
beginning
to
get
scared
and
to
think
i
would
be
killed
at
the
halt
just
before
you
advanced
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
hills
in
the
evening
each
time
that
notes
were
taken
the
page
was
put
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
my
wife
at
the
first
chance
they
were
mailed
to
her
and
on
my
arrival
in
the
united
states
the
story
of
the
fight
taken
from
these
notes
was
entered
in
the
diary
i
keep
in
a
book
i
make
this
lengthy
explanation
that
you
may
see
that
everything
put
down
was
fresh
in
my
memory
i
quote
from
my
diary
the
tension
on
the
men
was
great
suddenly
a
line
of
men
appeared
coming
from
our
right
they
were
advancing
through
the
long
grass
deployed
as
skirmishers
and
were
under
fire
at
their
head
or
rather
in
front
of
them
and
leading
them
rode
colonel
roosevelt
he
was
very
conspicuous
mounted
as
he
was
the
men
were
the
riders
i
heard
some
one
calling
to
them
not
to
fire
into
us
and
seeing
colonel
carrol
reported
to
him
and
was
told
to
go
out
and
meet
them
and
caution
them
as
to
our
position
we
being
between
them
and
the
enemy
i
did
so
speaking
to
colonel
roosevelt
i
also
told
him
we
were
under
orders
not
to
advance
and
asked
him
if
he
had
received
any
orders
he
replied
that
he
was
going
to
charge
the
spanish
trenches
i
told
this
to
colonel
carrol
and
to
captain
dimmick
our
squadron
commander
a
few
moments
after
the
word
passed
down
that
our
left
captain
taylor
was
about
to
charge
captain
mcblain
called
out
must
go
in
with
those
troops
we
must
support
taylor
i
called
this
to
captain
dimmick
and
he
gave
the
order
to
assault
the
cheer
was
taken
up
and
taken
up
again
on
the
left
and
in
the
distance
it
rolled
on
and
on
and
so
we
started
colonel
roosevelt
of
the
rough
riders
started
the
whole
movement
on
the
left
which
was
the
first
advance
of
the
assault
the
following
is
taken
from
my
notes
and
was
hastily
jotted
down
on
the
field
the
rough
riders
came
in
line
colonel
roosevelt
said
he
would
assault
taylor
joined
them
with
his
troop
mcblain
called
to
dimmick
us
go
we
must
go
to
support
them
dimmick
said
all
right
and
so
with
no
orders
we
went
in
i
find
many
of
my
notes
are
illegible
from
perspiration
my
authority
for
saying
taylor
went
in
with
you
joined
with
his
troop
was
the
word
passed
to
me
and
repeated
to
captain
dimmick
that
taylor
was
about
to
charge
with
you
i
could
not
see
his
troop
i
have
not
put
it
in
my
diary
but
in
another
place
i
have
noted
that
colonel
carrol
who
was
acting
as
brigade
commander
told
me
to
ask
you
if
you
had
any
orders
i
have
the
honor
to
be
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
henry
anson
barber
captain
infantry
formerly
of
ninth
cavalry
headquarters
pacific
division
san
francisco
may
dear
president
as
some
discussion
has
arisen
in
the
public
prints
regarding
the
battle
of
san
juan
cuba
july
and
your
personal
movements
during
that
day
have
been
the
subject
of
comment
it
may
not
be
amiss
in
me
to
state
some
facts
coming
under
my
personal
observation
as
commanding
general
of
the
cavalry
division
of
which
your
regiment
formed
a
part
it
will
perhaps
be
advisable
to
show
first
how
i
came
to
be
in
command
in
order
that
my
statement
may
have
due
weight
as
an
authoritative
statement
of
facts
i
was
placed
in
command
of
the
cavalry
division
on
the
afternoon
of
june
by
general
shafter
the
assignment
was
made
owing
to
the
severe
illness
of
general
wheeler
who
was
the
permanent
commander
of
said
division
brigadier
general
young
who
commanded
the
second
cavalry
brigade
of
which
your
regiment
the
first
volunteer
cavalry
formed
a
part
was
also
very
ill
and
i
found
it
necessary
to
relieve
him
from
command
and
place
colonel
wood
of
the
rough
riders
in
command
of
the
brigade
this
change
placed
you
in
command
of
your
regiment
the
division
moved
from
its
camp
on
the
evening
of
june
and
bivouacked
at
and
about
el
poso
i
saw
you
personally
in
the
vicinity
of
el
poso
about
july
i
saw
you
again
on
the
road
leading
from
el
poso
to
the
san
juan
river
you
were
at
the
head
of
your
regiment
which
was
leading
the
second
brigade
and
immediately
behind
the
rear
regiment
of
the
first
brigade
my
orders
were
to
turn
to
the
right
at
san
juan
river
and
take
up
a
line
along
that
stream
and
try
and
connect
with
general
lawton
who
was
to
engage
the
enemy
at
el
caney
on
reaching
the
river
we
came
under
the
fire
of
the
spanish
forces
posted
on
san
juan
ridge
and
kettle
hill
the
first
brigade
was
faced
to
the
front
in
line
as
soon
as
it
had
cleared
the
road
and
the
second
brigade
was
ordered
to
pass
in
rear
of
the
first
and
face
to
the
front
when
clear
of
the
first
brigade
this
movement
was
very
difficult
owing
to
the
heavy
undergrowth
and
the
regiments
became
more
or
less
tangled
up
but
eventually
the
formation
was
accomplished
and
the
division
stood
in
an
irregular
line
along
the
san
juan
river
the
second
brigade
on
the
right
we
were
subjected
to
a
heavy
fire
from
the
forces
on
san
juan
ridge
and
kettle
hill
our
position
was
untenable
and
it
became
necessary
to
assault
the
enemy
or
fall
back
kettle
hill
was
immediately
in
front
of
the
cavalry
and
it
was
determined
to
assault
that
hill
the
first
brigade
was
ordered
forward
and
the
second
brigade
was
ordered
to
support
the
attack
personally
i
accompanied
a
portion
of
the
tenth
cavalry
second
brigade
and
the
rough
riders
were
to
the
right
this
brought
your
regiment
to
the
right
of
the
house
which
was
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
shortly
after
i
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
you
came
to
me
accompanied
i
think
by
captain
stevens
of
the
ninth
cavalry
we
were
then
in
a
position
to
see
the
line
of
intrenchments
along
san
juan
ridge
and
could
see
kent
infantry
division
engaged
on
our
left
and
hawkins
assault
against
fort
san
juan
you
asked
me
for
permission
to
move
forward
and
assault
san
juan
ridge
i
gave
you
the
order
in
person
to
move
forward
and
i
saw
you
move
forward
and
assault
san
juan
ridge
with
your
regiment
and
portions
of
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
belonging
to
your
brigade
i
held
a
portion
of
the
second
brigade
as
a
reserve
on
kettle
hill
not
knowing
what
force
the
enemy
might
have
in
reserve
behind
the
ridge
the
first
brigade
also
moved
forward
and
assaulted
the
ridge
to
the
right
of
fort
san
juan
there
was
a
small
lake
between
kettle
hill
and
san
juan
ridge
and
in
moving
forward
your
command
passed
to
the
right
of
this
lake
this
brought
you
opposite
a
house
on
san
juan
ridge
not
fort
san
juan
proper
but
a
frame
house
surrounded
by
an
earthwork
the
enemy
lost
a
number
of
men
at
this
point
whose
bodies
lay
in
the
trenches
later
in
the
day
i
rode
along
the
line
and
as
i
recall
it
a
portion
of
the
tenth
cavalry
was
immediately
about
this
house
and
your
regiment
occupied
an
irregular
position
along
the
ridge
and
immediately
to
the
right
of
the
house
you
had
pickets
out
to
your
front
and
several
hundred
yards
to
your
front
the
spaniards
had
a
heavy
outpost
occupying
a
house
with
rifle
pits
surrounding
it
later
in
the
day
and
during
the
following
day
the
various
regiments
forming
the
division
were
rearranged
and
brought
into
tactical
formation
the
first
brigade
on
the
left
and
immediately
to
the
right
of
fort
san
juan
and
the
second
brigade
on
the
right
of
the
first
this
was
the
position
occupied
by
the
cavalry
division
until
the
final
surrender
of
the
spanish
forces
on
july
in
conclusion
allow
me
to
say
that
i
saw
you
personally
at
about
at
el
poso
later
on
the
road
to
san
juan
river
later
on
the
summit
of
kettle
hill
immediately
after
its
capture
by
the
cavalry
division
i
saw
you
move
forward
with
your
command
to
assault
san
juan
ridge
and
i
saw
you
on
san
juan
ridge
where
we
visited
your
line
together
and
you
explained
to
me
the
disposition
of
your
command

am
sir
with
much
respect

chapter
viii
the
new
york
governorship
in
september
the
first
volunteer
cavalry
in
company
with
most
of
the
rest
of
the
fifth
army
corps
was
disembarked
at
montauk
point
shortly
after
it
was
disbanded
and
a
few
days
later
i
was
nominated
for
governor
of
new
york
by
the
republican
party
timothy
woodruff
was
nominated
for
he
was
my
stanch
friend
throughout
the
term
of
our
joint
service
the
previous
year
the
machine
or
standpat
republicans
who
were
under
the
domination
of
senator
platt
had
come
to
a
complete
break
with
the
element
over
the
new
york
mayoralty
this
had
brought
the
republican
party
to
a
smash
not
only
in
new
york
city
but
in
the
state
where
the
democratic
candidate
for
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
alton
parker
was
elected
by
sixty
or
eighty
thousand
majority
parker
was
an
able
man
a
lieutenant
of
hill
standing
close
to
the
conservative
democrats
of
the
wall
street
type
these
conservative
democrats
were
planning
how
to
wrest
the
democratic
party
from
the
control
of
bryan
they
hailed
judge
parker
victory
as
a
godsend
the
judge
at
once
loomed
up
as
a
presidential
possibility
and
was
carefully
groomed
for
the
position
by
the
new
york
democratic
machine
and
its
financial
allies
in
the
new
york
business
world
the
republicans
realized
that
the
chances
were
very
much
against
them
accordingly
the
leaders
were
in
a
chastened
mood
and
ready
to
nominate
any
candidate
with
whom
they
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
winning
i
was
the
only
possibility
and
accordingly
under
pressure
from
certain
of
the
leaders
who
recognized
this
fact
and
who
responded
to
popular
pressure
senator
platt
picked
me
for
the
nomination
he
was
entirely
frank
in
the
matter
he
made
no
pretense
that
he
liked
me
personally
but
he
deferred
to
the
judgment
of
those
who
insisted
that
i
was
the
only
man
who
could
be
elected
and
that
therefore
i
had
to
be
nominated
foremost
among
the
leaders
who
pressed
me
on
platt
who
pestered
him
about
me
to
use
his
own
words
were
quigg
odell
then
state
chairman
of
the
republican
organization
and
afterwards
governor
and
hazel
now
united
states
judge
judge
hazel
did
not
know
me
personally
but
felt
that
the
sentiment
in
his
city
buffalo
demanded
my
nomination
and
that
the
then
republican
governor
black
could
not
be
reelected
odell
who
hardly
knew
me
personally
felt
the
same
way
about
black
chances
and
as
he
had
just
taken
the
state
chairmanship
he
was
very
anxious
to
win
a
victory
quigg
knew
me
quite
well
personally
he
had
been
in
touch
with
me
for
years
while
he
was
a
reporter
on
the
and
also
when
he
edited
a
paper
in
montana
he
had
been
on
good
terms
with
me
while
he
was
in
congress
and
i
was
civil
service
commissioner
meeting
me
often
in
company
with
my
especial
cronies
in
congress
men
like
lodge
speaker
tom
reed
greenhalge
butterworth
and
dolliver
and
he
had
urged
my
appointment
as
police
commissioner
on
mayor
strong
it
was
quigg
who
called
on
me
at
montauk
point
to
sound
me
about
the
governorship
platt
being
by
no
means
enthusiastic
over
mission
largely
because
he
disapproved
of
the
spanish
war
and
of
my
part
in
bringing
it
about
quigg
saw
me
in
my
tent
in
which
he
spent
a
couple
of
hours
with
me
my
douglas
robinson
being
also
present
quigg
spoke
very
frankly
to
me
stating
that
he
earnestly
desired
to
see
me
nominated
and
believed
that
the
great
body
of
republican
voters
in
the
state
so
desired
but
that
the
organization
and
the
state
convention
would
finally
do
what
senator
platt
desired
he
said
that
county
leaders
were
already
coming
to
senator
platt
hinting
at
a
close
election
expressing
doubt
of
governor
black
availability
for
reelection
and
asking
why
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
to
nominate
me
that
now
that
i
had
returned
to
the
united
states
this
would
go
on
more
and
more
all
the
time
and
that
he
quigg
did
not
wish
that
these
men
should
be
discouraged
and
be
sent
back
to
their
localities
to
suppress
a
rising
sentiment
in
my
favor
for
this
reason
he
said
that
he
wanted
from
me
a
plain
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
i
wanted
the
nomination
and
as
to
what
would
be
my
attitude
toward
the
organization
in
the
event
of
my
nomination
and
election
whether
or
not
i
would
make
war
on
platt
and
his
friends
or
whether
i
would
confer
with
them
and
with
the
organization
leaders
generally
and
give
fair
consideration
to
their
point
of
view
as
to
party
policy
and
public
interest
he
said
he
had
not
come
to
make
me
any
offer
of
the
nomination
and
had
no
authority
to
do
so
nor
to
get
any
pledges
or
promises
he
simply
wanted
a
frank
definition
of
my
attitude
towards
existing
party
conditions
to
this
i
replied
that
i
should
like
to
be
nominated
and
if
nominated
would
promise
to
throw
myself
into
the
campaign
with
all
possible
energy
i
said
that
i
should
not
make
war
on
platt
or
anybody
else
if
war
could
be
avoided
that
what
i
wanted
was
to
be
governor
and
not
a
faction
leader
that
i
certainly
would
confer
with
the
organization
men
as
with
everybody
else
who
seemed
to
me
to
have
knowledge
of
and
interest
in
public
affairs
and
that
as
to
platt
and
the
organization
leaders
i
would
do
so
in
the
sincere
hope
that
there
might
always
result
harmony
of
opinion
and
purpose
but
that
while
i
would
try
to
get
on
well
with
the
organization
the
organization
must
with
equal
sincerity
strive
to
do
what
i
regarded
as
essential
for
the
public
good
and
that
in
every
case
after
full
consideration
of
what
everybody
had
to
say
who
might
possess
real
knowledge
of
the
matter
i
should
have
to
act
finally
as
my
own
judgment
and
conscience
dictated
and
administer
the
state
government
as
i
thought
it
ought
to
be
administered
quigg
said
that
this
was
precisely
what
he
supposed
i
would
say
that
it
was
all
anybody
could
expect
and
that
he
would
state
it
to
senator
platt
precisely
as
i
had
put
it
to
him
which
he
accordingly
did
and
throughout
my
term
as
governor
quigg
lived
loyally
up
to
our
understanding
in
a
letter
to
me
quigg
states
what
i
had
forgotten
that
i
told
him
to
tell
the
senator
that
i
would
talk
freely
with
him
and
had
no
intention
of
becoming
a
factional
leader
with
a
personal
organization
yet
that
i
must
have
direct
personal
relations
with
everybody
and
get
their
views
at
first
hand
whenever
i
so
desired
because
i
could
not
have
one
man
speaking
for
all
after
being
nominated
i
made
a
hard
and
aggressive
campaign
through
the
state
my
opponent
was
a
respectable
man
a
judge
behind
whom
stood
croker
the
boss
of
tammany
hall
my
object
was
to
make
the
people
understand
that
it
was
croker
and
not
the
nominal
candidate
who
was
my
real
opponent
that
the
choice
lay
between
crokerism
and
myself
croker
was
a
powerful
and
truculent
man
the
autocrat
of
his
organization
and
of
a
domineering
nature
for
his
own
reasons
he
insisted
upon
turning
down
an
excellent
democratic
judge
who
was
a
candidate
for
reelection
this
gave
me
my
chance
under
my
attack
croker
who
was
a
stalwart
fighting
man
and
who
would
not
take
an
attack
tamely
himself
came
to
the
front
i
was
able
to
fix
the
contest
in
the
public
mind
as
one
between
himself
and
myself
and
against
all
probabilities
i
won
by
the
rather
narrow
margin
of
eighteen
thousand
plurality
as
i
have
already
said
there
is
a
lunatic
fringe
to
every
reform
movement
at
least
of
all
the
sincere
reformers
supported
me
but
the
the
or
or
men
preferred
croker
to
me
and
another
knot
of
extremists
who
had
at
first
ardently
insisted
that
i
must
be
forced
on
platt
as
soon
as
platt
supported
me
themselves
opposed
me
he
supported
me
after
election
john
hay
wrote
me
as
follows
while
you
are
governor
i
believe
the
party
can
be
made
solid
as
never
before
you
have
already
shown
that
a
man
may
be
absolutely
honest
and
yet
practical
a
reformer
by
instinct
and
a
wise
politician
brave
bold
and
uncompromising
and
yet
not
a
wild
ass
of
the
desert
the
exhibition
made
by
the
professional
independents
in
voting
against
you
for
no
reason
on
earth
except
that
somebody
else
was
voting
for
you
is
a
lesson
that
is
worth
its
cost
at
that
time
boss
rule
was
at
its
very
zenith
bryan
candidacy
in
on
a
free
silver
platform
had
threatened
such
frightful
business
disaster
as
to
make
the
business
men
the
and
the
professional
classes
generally
turn
eagerly
to
the
republican
party
east
of
the
mississippi
the
republican
vote
for
mckinley
was
larger
by
far
than
it
had
been
for
abraham
lincoln
in
the
days
when
the
life
of
the
nation
was
at
stake
bryan
championed
many
sorely
needed
reforms
in
the
interest
of
the
plain
people
but
many
of
his
platform
proposals
economic
and
otherwise
were
of
such
a
character
that
to
have
put
them
into
practice
would
have
meant
to
plunge
all
our
people
into
conditions
far
worse
than
any
of
those
for
which
he
sought
a
remedy
the
free
silver
advocates
included
sincere
and
upright
men
who
were
able
to
make
a
strong
case
for
their
position
but
with
them
and
dominating
them
were
all
the
believers
in
the
complete
or
partial
repudiation
of
national
state
and
private
debts
and
not
only
the
business
men
but
the
workingmen
grew
to
feel
that
under
these
circumstances
too
heavy
a
price
could
not
be
paid
to
avert
the
democratic
triumph
the
fear
of
bryan
threw
almost
all
the
leading
men
of
all
classes
into
the
arms
of
whoever
opposed
him
the
republican
bosses
who
were
already
very
powerful
and
who
were
already
in
fairly
close
alliance
with
the
privileged
interests
now
found
everything
working
to
their
advantage
good
and
men
of
conservative
temperament
in
their
panic
played
into
the
hands
of
the
of
business
and
politics
the
alliance
between
the
two
kinds
of
privilege
political
and
financial
was
closely
cemented
and
wherever
there
was
any
attempt
to
break
it
up
the
cry
was
at
once
raised
that
this
merely
represented
another
phase
of
the
assault
on
national
honesty
and
individual
and
mercantile
integrity
as
so
often
happens
the
excesses
and
threats
of
an
unwise
and
extreme
radicalism
had
resulted
in
immensely
strengthening
the
position
of
the
beneficiaries
of
reaction
this
was
the
era
when
the
standard
oil
company
achieved
a
mastery
of
pennsylvania
politics
so
and
so
corrupt
that
it
is
difficult
to
describe
it
without
seeming
to
exaggerate
in
new
york
state
united
states
senator
platt
was
the
absolute
boss
of
the
republican
party
big
business
was
back
of
him
yet
at
the
time
this
the
most
important
element
in
his
strength
was
only
imperfectly
understood
it
was
not
until
i
was
elected
governor
that
i
myself
came
to
understand
it
we
were
still
accustomed
to
talking
of
the
machine
as
if
it
were
something
merely
political
with
which
business
had
nothing
to
do
senator
platt
did
not
use
his
political
position
to
advance
his
private
fortunes
therein
differing
absolutely
from
many
other
political
bosses
he
lived
in
hotels
and
had
few
extravagant
tastes
indeed
i
could
not
find
that
he
had
any
tastes
at
all
except
for
politics
and
on
rare
occasions
for
a
very
dry
theology
wholly
divorced
from
moral
implications
but
big
business
men
contributed
to
him
large
sums
of
money
which
enabled
him
to
keep
his
grip
on
the
machine
and
secured
for
them
the
help
of
the
machine
if
they
were
threatened
with
adverse
legislation
the
contributions
were
given
in
the
guise
of
contributions
for
campaign
purposes
of
money
for
the
good
of
the
party
when
the
money
was
contributed
there
was
rarely
talk
of
specific
favors
in
return
it
was
simply
put
into
platt
hands
and
treated
by
him
as
in
the
campaign
chest
then
he
distributed
it
in
the
districts
where
it
was
most
needed
by
the
candidates
and
organization
leaders
ordinarily
no
pledge
was
required
from
the
latter
to
the
bosses
any
more
than
it
was
required
by
the
business
men
from
platt
or
his
lieutenants
no
pledge
was
needed
it
was
all
a
gentlemen
understanding
as
the
senator
once
said
to
me
if
a
character
was
such
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
a
promise
from
him
it
was
clear
proof
that
his
character
was
such
that
the
promise
would
not
be
worth
anything
after
it
was
made
each
nation
has
its
own
pet
sins
to
which
it
is
merciful
and
also
sins
which
it
treats
as
most
abhorrent
in
america
we
are
peculiarly
sensitive
about
big
money
contributions
for
which
the
donors
expect
any
reward
in
england
where
in
some
ways
the
standard
is
higher
than
here
such
contributions
are
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
nay
as
one
of
the
methods
by
which
wealthy
men
obtain
peerages
it
would
be
an
impossibility
for
a
man
to
secure
a
seat
in
the
united
states
senate
by
mere
campaign
contributions
in
the
way
that
seats
in
the
british
house
of
lords
have
often
been
secured
without
any
scandal
being
caused
thereby
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
some
of
the
worst
practices
of
the
machine
in
dealings
of
this
kind
represented
merely
virtues
in
the
wrong
place
virtues
wrenched
out
of
proper
relation
to
their
surroundings
a
man
in
a
doubtful
district
might
win
only
because
of
the
help
platt
gave
him
he
might
be
a
decent
young
fellow
without
money
enough
to
finance
his
own
campaign
who
was
able
to
finance
it
only
because
platt
of
his
own
accord
found
out
or
was
apprised
of
his
need
and
advanced
the
money
such
a
man
felt
grateful
and
because
of
his
good
qualities
joined
with
the
purely
sordid
and
corrupt
heelers
and
crooked
politicians
to
become
part
of
the
platt
machine
in
his
turn
platt
was
recognized
by
the
business
men
the
big
contributors
as
an
honorable
man
not
only
a
man
of
his
word
but
a
man
who
whenever
he
received
a
favor
could
be
trusted
to
do
his
best
to
repay
it
on
any
occasion
that
arose
i
believe
that
usually
the
contributors
and
the
recipient
sincerely
felt
that
the
transaction
was
proper
and
subserved
the
cause
of
good
politics
and
good
business
and
indeed
as
regards
the
major
part
of
the
contributions
it
is
probable
that
this
was
the
fact
and
that
the
only
criticism
that
could
properly
be
made
about
the
contributions
was
that
they
were
not
made
with
publicity
and
at
that
time
neither
the
parties
nor
the
public
had
any
realization
that
publicity
was
necessary
or
any
adequate
understanding
of
the
dangers
of
the
invisible
empire
which
throve
by
what
was
done
in
secrecy
many
probably
most
of
the
contributors
of
this
type
never
wished
anything
personal
in
exchange
for
their
contributions
and
made
them
with
sincere
patriotism
desiring
in
return
only
that
the
government
should
be
conducted
on
a
proper
basis
unfortunately
it
was
in
practice
exceedingly
difficult
to
distinguish
these
men
from
the
others
who
contributed
big
sums
to
the
various
party
bosses
with
the
expectation
of
gaining
concrete
and
personal
advantages
in
which
the
bosses
shared
at
the
expense
of
the
general
public
it
was
very
hard
to
draw
the
line
between
these
two
types
of
contributions
there
was
but
one
kind
of
money
contributions
as
to
which
it
seemed
to
me
absolutely
impossible
for
either
the
contributor
or
the
recipient
to
disguise
to
themselves
the
evil
meaning
of
the
contribution
this
was
where
a
big
corporation
contributed
to
both
political
parties
i
knew
of
one
such
case
where
in
a
state
campaign
a
big
corporation
which
had
many
dealings
with
public
officials
frankly
contributed
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
one
campaign
fund
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
the
campaign
fund
of
the
other
side
and
i
believe
made
some
further
substantial
contributions
in
the
same
ratio
of
two
dollars
to
one
side
for
every
one
dollar
given
to
the
other
the
contributors
were
democrats
and
the
big
contributions
went
to
the
democratic
managers
the
republican
was
elected
and
after
his
election
when
a
matter
came
up
affecting
the
company
in
which
its
interests
were
hostile
to
those
of
the
general
public
the
successful
candidate
then
holding
a
high
state
office
was
approached
by
his
campaign
managers
and
the
situation
put
frankly
before
him
he
was
less
disturbed
than
astonished
and
remarked
why
i
thought
and
his
associates
were
democrats
and
subscribed
to
the
democratic
campaign
fund
so
they
did
was
the
answer
they
subscribed
to
them
twice
as
much
as
they
subscribed
to
us
but
if
they
had
had
any
idea
that
you
intended
doing
what
you
now
say
you
will
do
they
would
have
subscribed
it
all
to
the
other
side
and
more
too
the
state
official
in
his
turn
answered
that
he
was
very
sorry
if
any
one
had
subscribed
under
a
misapprehension
that
it
was
no
fault
of
his
for
he
had
stated
definitely
and
clearly
his
position
that
he
of
course
had
no
money
wherewith
himself
to
return
what
without
his
knowledge
had
been
contributed
and
that
all
he
could
say
was
that
any
man
who
had
subscribed
to
his
campaign
fund
under
the
impression
that
the
receipt
of
the
subscription
would
be
a
bar
to
the
performance
of
public
duty
was
sadly
mistaken
the
control
by
platt
and
his
lieutenants
over
the
organization
was
complete
there
were
splits
among
the
bosses
and
insurgent
movements
now
and
then
but
the
ordinary
citizens
had
no
control
over
the
political
machinery
except
in
a
very
few
districts
there
were
however
plenty
of
good
men
in
politics
men
who
either
came
from
districts
where
there
was
popular
control
or
who
represented
a
genuine
aspiration
towards
good
citizenship
on
the
part
of
some
boss
or
group
of
bosses
or
else
who
had
been
nominated
frankly
for
reasons
of
expediency
by
bosses
whose
attitude
towards
good
citizenship
was
at
best
one
of
indifference
at
the
time
when
i
was
nominated
for
governor
as
later
when
hughes
was
nominated
and
renominated
for
governor
there
was
no
possibility
of
securing
the
nomination
unless
the
bosses
permitted
it
in
each
case
the
bosses
the
machine
leaders
took
a
man
for
whom
they
did
not
care
because
he
was
the
only
man
with
whom
they
could
win
in
the
case
of
hughes
there
was
of
course
also
the
fact
of
pressure
from
the
national
administration
but
the
bosses
were
never
overcome
in
a
fair
fight
when
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
fight
until
the
saratoga
convention
in
when
stimson
was
nominated
for
governor
senator
platt
had
the
same
inborn
capacity
for
the
kind
of
politics
which
he
liked
that
many
big
wall
street
men
have
shown
for
not
wholly
dissimilar
types
of
finance
it
was
his
chief
interest
and
he
applied
himself
to
it
unremittingly
he
handled
his
private
business
successfully
but
it
was
politics
in
which
he
was
absorbed
and
he
concerned
himself
therewith
every
day
in
the
year
he
had
built
up
an
excellent
system
of
organization
and
the
necessary
funds
came
from
corporations
and
men
of
wealth
who
contributed
as
i
have
described
above
the
majority
of
the
men
with
a
natural
capacity
for
organization
leadership
of
the
type
which
has
generally
been
prevalent
in
new
york
politics
turned
to
senator
platt
as
their
natural
chief
and
helped
build
up
the
organization
until
under
his
leadership
it
became
more
powerful
and
in
a
position
of
greater
control
than
any
other
republican
machine
in
the
country
excepting
in
pennsylvania
the
democratic
machines
in
some
of
the
big
cities
as
in
new
york
and
boston
and
the
country
democratic
machine
of
new
york
under
david
hill
were
probably
even
more
efficient
representing
an
even
more
complete
mastery
by
the
bosses
and
an
even
greater
degree
of
drilled
obedience
among
the
henchmen
it
would
be
an
entire
mistake
to
suppose
that
lieutenants
were
either
all
bad
men
or
all
influenced
by
unworthy
motives
he
was
constantly
doing
favors
for
men
he
had
won
the
gratitude
of
many
good
men
in
the
country
districts
especially
there
were
many
places
where
his
machine
included
the
majority
of
the
best
citizens
the
leading
and
substantial
citizens
among
the
inhabitants
some
of
his
strongest
and
most
efficient
lieutenants
were
disinterested
men
of
high
character
there
had
always
been
a
good
deal
of
opposition
to
platt
and
the
machine
but
the
leadership
of
this
opposition
was
apt
to
be
found
only
among
those
whom
abraham
lincoln
called
the
silk
stockings
and
much
of
it
excited
almost
as
much
derision
among
the
plain
people
as
the
machine
itself
excited
anger
or
dislike
very
many
of
opponents
really
disliked
him
and
his
methods
for
aesthetic
rather
than
for
moral
reasons
and
the
bulk
of
the
people
felt
this
and
refused
to
submit
to
their
leadership
the
men
who
opposed
him
in
this
manner
were
good
citizens
according
to
their
lights
prominent
in
the
social
clubs
and
in
philanthropic
circles
men
of
means
and
often
men
of
business
standing
they
disliked
coarse
and
vulgar
politicians
and
they
sincerely
reprobated
all
the
shortcomings
that
were
recognized
by
and
were
offensive
to
people
of
their
own
caste
they
had
not
the
slightest
understanding
of
the
needs
interests
ways
of
thought
and
convictions
of
the
average
small
man
and
the
small
man
felt
this
although
he
could
not
express
it
and
sensed
that
they
were
really
not
concerned
with
his
welfare
and
that
they
did
not
offer
him
anything
materially
better
from
his
point
of
view
than
the
machine
when
reformers
of
this
type
attempted
to
oppose
platt
they
usually
put
up
either
some
rather
inefficient
person
who
bathed
every
day
and
did
steal
but
whose
only
good
point
was
respectability
and
who
knew
nothing
of
the
great
fundamental
questions
looming
before
us
or
else
they
put
up
some
big
business
man
or
corporation
lawyer
who
was
wedded
to
the
gross
wrong
and
injustice
of
our
economic
system
and
who
neither
by
personality
nor
by
programme
gave
the
ordinary
plain
people
any
belief
that
there
was
promise
of
vital
good
to
them
in
the
change
the
correctness
of
their
view
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
fundamental
economic
and
social
reforms
were
at
stake
the
aesthetic
as
distinguished
from
the
genuinely
moral
reformers
for
the
most
part
sided
with
the
bosses
against
the
people
when
i
became
governor
the
conscience
of
the
people
was
in
no
way
or
shape
aroused
as
it
has
since
become
roused
the
people
accepted
and
practiced
in
a
way
as
quite
proper
things
which
they
would
not
now
tolerate
they
had
no
definite
and
clearly
outlined
conception
of
what
they
wished
in
the
way
of
reform
they
on
the
whole
tolerated
and
indeed
approved
of
the
machine
and
there
had
been
no
development
on
any
considerable
scale
of
reformers
with
the
vision
to
see
what
the
needs
of
the
people
were
and
the
high
purpose
sanely
to
achieve
what
was
necessary
in
order
to
meet
these
needs
i
knew
both
the
machine
and
the
reformers
fairly
well
from
many
close
association
with
them
the
machine
as
such
had
no
ideals
at
all
although
many
of
the
men
composing
it
did
have
on
the
other
hand
the
ideals
of
very
many
of
the
reformers
did
not
relate
to
the
questions
of
real
and
vital
interest
to
our
people
and
singularly
enough
in
international
matters
these
same
were
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
the
average
ignorant
demagogue
or
shortsighted
spoils
politicians
i
felt
that
these
men
would
be
broken
reeds
to
which
to
trust
in
any
vital
contest
for
betterment
of
social
and
industrial
conditions
i
had
neither
the
training
nor
the
capacity
that
would
have
enabled
me
to
match
platt
and
his
machine
people
on
their
own
ground
nor
did
i
believe
that
the
effort
to
build
up
a
machine
of
my
own
under
the
then
existing
conditions
would
meet
the
needs
of
the
situation
so
far
as
the
people
were
concerned
i
therefore
made
no
effort
to
create
a
machine
of
my
own
and
consistently
adopted
the
plan
of
going
over
the
heads
of
the
men
holding
public
office
and
of
the
men
in
control
of
the
organization
and
appealing
directly
to
the
people
behind
them
the
machine
for
instance
had
a
more
or
less
strong
control
over
the
great
bulk
of
the
members
of
the
state
legislature
but
in
the
last
resort
the
people
behind
these
legislators
had
a
still
greater
control
over
them
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
only
way
i
could
beat
the
bosses
whenever
the
need
to
do
so
arose
and
unless
there
was
such
need
i
did
not
wish
to
try
was
not
by
attempting
to
manipulate
the
machinery
and
not
by
trusting
merely
to
the
professional
reformers
but
by
making
my
appeal
as
directly
and
as
emphatically
as
i
knew
how
to
the
mass
of
voters
themselves
to
the
people
to
the
men
who
if
waked
up
would
be
able
to
impose
their
will
on
their
representatives
my
success
depended
upon
getting
the
people
in
the
different
districts
to
look
at
matters
in
my
way
and
getting
them
to
take
such
an
active
interest
in
affairs
as
to
enable
them
to
exercise
control
over
their
representatives
there
were
a
few
of
the
senators
and
assemblymen
whom
i
could
reach
by
seeing
them
personally
and
putting
before
them
my
arguments
but
most
of
them
were
too
much
under
the
control
of
the
machine
for
me
to
shake
them
loose
unless
they
knew
that
the
people
were
actively
behind
me
in
making
my
appeal
to
the
people
as
a
whole
i
was
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
constituency
from
that
which
especially
in
the
big
cities
liked
to
think
of
itself
as
the
better
element
the
particular
exponent
of
reform
and
good
citizenship
i
was
dealing
with
shrewd
kindly
men
and
women
chiefly
concerned
with
the
absorbing
work
of
earning
their
own
living
and
impatient
of
fads
who
had
grown
to
feel
that
the
associations
with
the
word
reformer
were
not
much
better
than
the
associations
with
the
word
politician
i
had
to
convince
these
men
and
women
of
my
good
faith
and
moreover
of
my
common
sense
and
efficiency
they
were
most
of
them
strong
partisans
and
an
outrage
had
to
be
very
real
and
very
great
to
shake
them
even
partially
loose
from
their
party
affiliations
moreover
they
took
little
interest
in
any
fight
of
mere
personalities
they
were
not
influenced
in
the
least
by
the
reform
view
of
platt
i
knew
that
if
they
were
persuaded
that
i
was
engaged
in
a
mere
faction
fight
against
him
that
it
was
a
mere
issue
between
his
ambition
and
mine
they
would
at
once
become
indifferent
and
my
fight
would
be
lost
but
i
felt
that
i
could
count
on
their
support
wherever
i
could
show
them
that
the
fight
was
not
made
just
for
the
sake
of
the
row
that
it
was
not
made
merely
as
a
factional
contest
against
senator
platt
and
the
organization
but
was
waged
from
a
sense
of
duty
for
real
and
tangible
causes
such
as
the
promotion
of
governmental
efficiency
and
honesty
and
forcing
powerful
moneyed
men
to
take
the
proper
attitude
toward
the
community
at
large
they
stood
by
me
when
i
insisted
upon
having
the
canal
department
the
insurance
department
and
the
various
departments
of
the
state
government
run
with
efficiency
and
honesty
they
stood
by
me
when
i
insisted
upon
making
wealthy
men
who
owned
franchises
pay
the
state
what
they
properly
ought
to
pay
they
stood
by
me
when
in
connection
with
the
strikes
on
the
croton
aqueduct
and
in
buffalo
i
promptly
used
the
military
power
of
the
state
to
put
a
stop
to
rioting
and
violence
in
the
latter
case
my
chief
opponents
and
critics
were
local
politicians
who
were
truckling
to
the
labor
vote
but
in
all
cases
coming
under
the
first
two
categories
i
had
serious
trouble
with
the
state
leaders
of
the
machine
i
always
did
my
best
in
good
faith
to
get
platt
and
the
other
heads
of
the
machine
to
accept
my
views
and
to
convince
them
by
repeated
private
conversations
that
i
was
right
i
never
wantonly
antagonized
or
humiliated
them
i
did
not
wish
to
humiliate
them
or
to
seem
victorious
over
them
what
i
wished
was
to
secure
the
things
that
i
thought
it
essential
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
state
to
secure
if
i
could
finally
persuade
them
to
support
me
well
and
good
in
such
case
i
continued
to
work
with
them
in
the
friendliest
manner
if
after
repeated
and
persistent
effort
i
failed
to
get
them
to
support
me
then
i
made
a
fair
fight
in
the
open
and
in
a
majority
of
cases
i
carried
my
point
and
succeeded
in
getting
through
the
legislation
which
i
wished
in
theory
the
executive
has
nothing
to
do
with
legislation
in
practice
as
things
now
are
the
executive
is
or
ought
to
be
peculiarly
representative
of
the
people
as
a
whole
as
often
as
not
the
action
of
the
executive
offers
the
only
means
by
which
the
people
can
get
the
legislation
they
demand
and
ought
to
have
therefore
a
good
executive
under
the
present
conditions
of
american
political
life
must
take
a
very
active
interest
in
getting
the
right
kind
of
legislation
in
addition
to
performing
his
executive
duties
with
an
eye
single
to
the
public
welfare
more
than
half
of
my
work
as
governor
was
in
the
direction
of
getting
needed
and
important
legislation
i
accomplished
this
only
by
arousing
the
people
and
riveting
their
attention
on
what
was
done
gradually
the
people
began
to
wake
up
more
and
more
to
the
fact
that
the
machine
politicians
were
not
giving
them
the
kind
of
government
which
they
wished
as
this
waking
up
grew
more
general
not
merely
in
new
york
or
any
other
one
state
but
throughout
most
of
the
nation
the
power
of
the
bosses
waned
then
a
curious
thing
happened
the
professional
reformers
who
had
most
loudly
criticized
these
bosses
began
to
change
toward
them
newspaper
editors
college
presidents
corporation
lawyers
and
big
business
men
all
alike
had
denounced
the
bosses
and
had
taken
part
in
reform
movements
against
them
so
long
as
these
reforms
dealt
only
with
things
that
were
superficial
or
with
fundamental
things
that
did
not
affect
themselves
and
their
associates
but
the
majority
of
these
men
turned
to
the
support
of
the
bosses
when
the
great
new
movement
began
clearly
to
make
itself
evident
as
one
against
privilege
in
business
no
less
than
against
privilege
in
politics
as
one
for
social
and
industrial
no
less
than
for
political
righteousness
and
fair
dealing
the
big
corporation
lawyer
who
had
antagonized
the
boss
in
matters
which
he
regarded
as
purely
political
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
boss
when
the
movement
for
betterment
took
shape
in
direct
attack
on
the
combination
of
business
with
politics
and
with
the
judiciary
which
has
done
so
much
to
enthrone
privilege
in
the
economic
world
the
reformers
who
denounced
political
corruption
and
fraud
when
shown
at
the
expense
of
their
own
candidates
by
machine
ward
heelers
of
a
low
type
hysterically
applauded
similar
corrupt
trickery
when
practiced
by
these
same
politicians
against
men
with
whose
political
and
industrial
programme
the
reformers
were
not
in
sympathy
i
had
always
been
instinctively
and
by
nature
a
democrat
but
if
i
had
needed
conversion
to
the
democratic
ideal
here
in
america
the
stimulus
would
have
been
supplied
by
what
i
saw
of
the
attitude
not
merely
of
the
bulk
of
the
men
of
greatest
wealth
but
of
the
bulk
of
the
men
who
most
prided
themselves
upon
their
education
and
culture
when
we
began
in
good
faith
to
grapple
with
the
wrong
and
injustice
of
our
social
and
industrial
system
and
to
hit
at
the
men
responsible
for
the
wrong
no
matter
how
high
they
stood
in
business
or
in
politics
at
the
bar
or
on
the
bench
it
was
while
i
was
governor
and
especially
in
connection
with
the
franchise
tax
legislation
that
i
first
became
thoroughly
aware
of
the
real
causes
of
this
attitude
among
the
men
of
great
wealth
and
among
the
men
who
took
their
tone
from
the
men
of
great
wealth
very
soon
after
my
victory
in
the
race
for
governor
i
had
one
or
two
experiences
with
senator
platt
which
showed
in
amusing
fashion
how
absolute
the
rule
of
the
boss
was
in
the
politics
of
that
day
senator
platt
who
was
always
most
kind
and
friendly
in
his
personal
relations
with
me
asked
me
in
one
day
to
talk
over
what
was
to
be
done
at
albany
he
had
the
two
or
three
nominal
heads
of
the
organization
with
him
they
were
his
lieutenants
who
counseled
and
influenced
him
whose
advice
he
often
followed
but
who
when
he
had
finally
made
up
his
mind
merely
registered
and
carried
out
his
decrees
after
a
little
conversation
the
senator
asked
if
i
had
any
member
of
the
assembly
whom
i
wished
to
have
put
on
any
committee
explaining
that
the
committees
were
being
arranged
i
answered
no
and
expressed
my
surprise
at
what
he
had
said
because
i
had
not
understood
the
speaker
who
appointed
the
committees
had
himself
been
agreed
upon
by
the
oh
responded
the
senator
with
a
tolerant
smile
he
has
not
been
chosen
yet
but
of
course
whoever
we
choose
as
speaker
will
agree
beforehand
to
make
the
appointments
we
wish
i
made
a
mental
note
to
the
effect
that
if
they
attempted
the
same
process
with
the
they
would
find
themselves
mistaken
in
a
few
days
the
opportunity
to
prove
this
arrived
under
the
preceding
administration
there
had
been
grave
scandals
about
the
erie
canal
the
canal
and
these
scandals
had
been
one
of
the
chief
issues
in
the
campaign
for
the
governorship
the
construction
of
this
work
was
under
the
control
of
the
superintendent
of
public
works
in
the
actual
state
of
affairs
his
office
was
by
far
the
most
important
office
under
me
and
i
intended
to
appoint
to
it
some
man
of
high
character
and
capacity
who
could
be
trusted
to
do
the
work
not
merely
honestly
and
efficiently
but
without
regard
to
politics
a
week
or
so
after
the
speakership
incident
senator
platt
asked
me
to
come
and
see
him
he
was
an
old
and
physically
feeble
man
able
to
move
about
only
with
extreme
difficulty
on
arrival
i
found
the
elect
woodruff
who
had
also
been
asked
to
come
the
senator
informed
me
that
he
was
glad
to
say
that
i
would
have
a
most
admirable
man
as
superintendent
of
public
works
as
he
had
just
received
a
telegram
from
a
certain
gentleman
whom
he
named
saying
that
he
would
accept
the
position
he
handed
me
the
telegram
the
man
in
question
was
a
man
i
liked
later
i
appointed
him
to
an
important
office
in
which
he
did
well
but
he
came
from
a
city
along
the
line
of
the
canal
so
that
i
did
not
think
it
best
that
he
should
be
appointed
anyhow
and
moreover
what
was
far
more
important
it
was
necessary
to
have
it
understood
at
the
very
outset
that
the
administration
was
my
administration
and
was
no
one
else
but
mine
so
i
told
the
senator
very
politely
that
i
was
sorry
but
that
i
could
not
appoint
his
man
this
produced
an
explosion
but
i
declined
to
lose
my
temper
merely
repeating
that
i
must
decline
to
accept
any
man
chosen
for
me
and
that
i
must
choose
the
man
myself
although
i
was
very
polite
i
was
also
very
firm
and
platt
and
his
friends
finally
abandoned
their
position
i
appointed
an
engineer
from
brooklyn
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
colonel
partridge
who
had
served
in
mayor
low
administration
he
was
an
excellent
man
in
every
way
he
chose
as
his
assistant
actively
to
superintend
the
work
a
cornell
graduate
named
elon
hooker
a
man
with
no
political
backing
at
all
picked
simply
because
he
was
the
best
equipped
man
for
the
place
the
office
the
most
important
office
under
me
was
run
in
admirable
fashion
throughout
my
administration
i
doubt
if
there
ever
was
an
important
department
of
the
new
york
state
government
run
with
a
higher
standard
of
efficiency
and
integrity
but
this
was
not
all
that
had
to
be
done
about
the
canals
evidently
the
whole
policy
hitherto
pursued
had
been
foolish
and
inadequate
i
appointed
a
commission
of
business
men
and
expert
engineers
who
went
into
the
matter
exhaustively
and
their
report
served
as
the
basis
upon
which
our
entire
present
canal
system
is
based
there
remained
the
question
of
determining
whether
the
canal
officials
who
were
in
office
before
i
became
governor
and
whom
i
had
declined
to
reappoint
had
been
guilty
of
any
action
because
of
which
it
would
be
possible
to
proceed
against
them
criminally
or
otherwise
under
the
law
such
criminal
action
had
been
freely
charged
against
them
during
the
campaign
by
the
democratic
including
the
mugwump
press
to
determine
this
matter
i
appointed
two
democratic
lawyers
fox
and
macfarlane
the
latter
federal
district
attorney
for
new
york
under
president
cleveland
and
put
the
whole
investigation
in
their
hands
these
gentlemen
made
an
exhaustive
investigation
lasting
several
months
they
reported
that
there
had
been
grave
delinquency
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
delinquency
which
justified
public
condemnation
of
those
responsible
for
it
who
were
out
of
office
but
that
there
was
no
ground
for
criminal
prosecution
i
laid
their
report
before
the
legislature
with
a
message
in
which
i
said
there
is
probably
no
lawyer
of
high
standing
in
the
state
who
after
studying
the
report
of
counsel
in
this
case
and
the
testimony
taken
by
the
investigating
commission
would
disagree
with
them
as
to
the
impracticability
of
a
successful
prosecution
under
such
circumstances
the
one
remedy
was
a
thorough
change
in
the
methods
and
management
this
change
has
been
made
when
my
successor
in
the
governorship
took
office
colonel
partridge
retired
and
elon
hooker
finding
that
he
could
no
longer
act
with
entire
disregard
of
politics
and
with
an
eye
single
to
the
efficiency
of
the
work
also
left
a
dozen
years
later
having
in
the
meantime
made
a
marked
success
in
a
business
career
he
became
the
treasurer
of
the
national
progressive
party
my
action
in
regard
to
the
canals
and
the
management
of
his
office
the
most
important
office
under
me
by
colonel
partridge
established
my
relations
with
platt
from
the
outset
on
pretty
nearly
the
right
basis
but
besides
various
small
difficulties
we
had
one
or
two
serious
bits
of
trouble
before
my
duties
as
governor
ceased
it
must
be
remembered
that
platt
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
large
part
of
and
sometimes
a
majority
of
the
legislature
there
were
a
few
entirely
independent
men
such
as
nathaniel
elsberg
regis
post
and
alford
cooley
in
each
of
the
two
houses
the
remainder
were
under
the
control
of
the
republican
and
democratic
bosses
but
could
also
be
more
or
less
influenced
by
an
aroused
public
opinion
the
two
machines
were
apt
to
make
common
cause
if
their
vital
interests
were
touched
it
was
my
business
to
devise
methods
by
which
either
the
two
machines
could
be
kept
apart
or
else
overthrown
if
they
came
together
my
desire
was
to
achieve
results
and
not
merely
to
issue
manifestoes
of
virtue
it
is
very
easy
to
be
efficient
if
the
efficiency
is
based
on
unscrupulousness
and
it
is
still
easier
to
be
virtuous
if
one
is
content
with
the
purely
negative
virtue
which
consists
in
not
doing
anything
wrong
but
being
wholly
unable
to
accomplish
anything
positive
for
good
my
favorite
quotation
from
josh
billings
again
applies
it
is
so
much
easier
to
be
a
harmless
dove
than
a
wise
serpent
my
duty
was
to
combine
both
idealism
and
efficiency
at
that
time
the
public
conscience
was
still
dormant
as
regards
many
species
of
political
and
business
misconduct
as
to
which
during
the
next
decade
it
became
sensitive
i
had
to
work
with
the
tools
at
hand
and
to
take
into
account
the
feeling
of
the
people
which
i
have
already
described
my
aim
was
persistently
to
refuse
to
be
put
in
a
position
where
what
i
did
would
seem
to
be
a
mere
faction
struggle
against
senator
platt
my
aim
was
to
make
a
fight
only
when
i
could
so
manage
it
that
there
could
be
no
question
in
the
minds
of
honest
men
that
my
prime
purpose
was
not
to
attack
platt
or
any
one
else
except
as
a
necessary
incident
to
securing
clean
and
efficient
government
in
each
case
i
did
my
best
to
persuade
platt
not
to
oppose
me
i
endeavored
to
make
it
clear
to
him
that
i
was
not
trying
to
wrest
the
organization
from
him
and
i
always
gave
him
in
detail
the
reasons
why
i
felt
i
had
to
take
the
position
i
intended
to
adopt
it
was
only
after
i
had
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
my
patience
that
i
would
finally
if
he
still
proved
obstinate
tell
him
that
i
intended
to
make
the
fight
anyhow
as
i
have
said
the
senator
was
an
old
and
feeble
man
in
physique
and
it
was
possible
for
him
to
go
about
very
little
until
friday
evening
he
would
be
kept
at
his
duties
at
washington
while
i
was
in
albany
if
i
wished
to
see
him
it
generally
had
to
be
at
his
hotel
in
new
york
on
saturday
and
usually
i
would
go
there
to
breakfast
with
him
the
one
thing
i
would
not
permit
was
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
secret
or
clandestine
meeting
i
always
insisted
on
going
openly
solemn
reformers
of
the
variety
who
according
to
their
custom
paid
attention
to
the
name
and
not
the
thing
were
much
exercised
over
my
breakfasting
with
platt
whenever
i
breakfasted
with
him
they
became
sure
that
the
fact
carried
with
it
some
sinister
significance
the
worthy
creatures
never
took
the
trouble
to
follow
the
sequence
of
facts
and
events
for
themselves
if
they
had
done
so
they
would
have
seen
that
any
series
of
breakfasts
with
platt
always
meant
that
i
was
going
to
do
something
he
did
not
like
and
that
i
was
trying
courteously
and
frankly
to
reconcile
him
to
it
my
object
was
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
him
to
come
with
me
as
long
as
there
was
no
clash
between
us
there
was
no
object
in
my
seeing
him
it
was
only
when
the
clash
came
or
was
imminent
that
i
had
to
see
him
a
series
of
breakfasts
was
always
the
prelude
to
some
active
warfare
in
every
instance
i
substantially
carried
my
point
although
in
some
cases
not
in
exactly
the
way
in
which
i
had
originally
hoped
to
illustrate
my
meaning
i
quote
from
a
letter
of
mine
to
senator
platt
of
december
he
had
been
trying
to
get
me
to
promote
a
certain
judge
x
over
the
head
of
another
judge
i
wrote
there
is
a
strong
feeling
among
the
judges
and
the
leading
members
of
the
bar
that
judge
y
ought
not
to
have
judge
x
jumped
over
his
head
and
i
do
not
see
my
way
clear
to
doing
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
solution
i
mentioned
to
you
is
the
solution
i
shall
have
to
adopt
remember
the
breakfast
at
douglas
robinson
at
there
were
various
measures
to
which
he
gave
a
grudging
and
querulous
assent
without
any
break
being
threatened
i
secured
the
reenactment
of
the
civil
service
law
which
under
my
predecessor
had
very
foolishly
been
repealed
i
secured
a
mass
of
labor
legislation
including
the
enactment
of
laws
to
increase
the
number
of
factory
inspectors
to
create
a
tenement
house
commission
whose
findings
resulted
in
further
and
excellent
legislation
to
improve
housing
conditions
to
regulate
and
improve
sweatshop
labor
to
make
the
and
prevailing
rate
of
wages
law
effective
to
secure
the
genuine
enforcement
of
the
act
relating
to
the
hours
of
railway
workers
to
compel
railways
to
equip
freight
trains
with
to
regulate
the
working
hours
of
women
and
protect
both
women
and
children
from
dangerous
machinery
to
enforce
good
scaffolding
provisions
for
workmen
on
buildings
to
provide
seats
for
the
use
of
waitresses
in
hotels
and
restaurants
to
reduce
the
hours
of
labor
for
clerks
to
provide
for
the
registration
of
laborers
for
municipal
employment
i
tried
hard
but
failed
to
secure
an
employers
liability
law
and
the
state
control
of
employment
offices
there
was
hard
fighting
over
some
of
these
bills
and
what
was
much
more
serious
there
was
effort
to
get
round
the
law
by
trickery
and
by
securing
its
inefficient
enforcement
i
was
continually
helped
by
men
with
whom
i
had
gotten
in
touch
while
in
the
police
department
men
such
as
james
bronson
reynolds
through
whom
i
first
became
interested
in
settlement
work
on
the
east
side
once
or
twice
i
went
suddenly
down
to
new
york
city
without
warning
any
one
and
traversed
the
quarters
visiting
various
picked
at
random
jake
riis
accompanied
me
and
as
a
result
of
our
inspection
we
got
not
only
an
improvement
in
the
law
but
a
still
more
marked
improvement
in
its
administration
thanks
chiefly
to
the
activity
and
good
sense
of
john
pryor
of
buffalo
and
by
the
use
of
every
pound
of
pressure
which
as
governor
i
could
bring
to
bear
in
legitimate
fashion
including
a
special
emergency
message
we
succeeded
in
getting
through
a
bill
providing
for
the
first
state
hospital
for
incipient
tuberculosis
we
got
valuable
laws
for
the
farmer
laws
preventing
the
adulteration
of
food
products
which
laws
were
equally
valuable
to
the
consumer
and
laws
helping
the
dairyman
in
addition
to
labor
legislation
i
was
able
to
do
a
good
deal
for
forest
preservation
and
the
protection
of
our
wild
life
all
that
later
i
strove
for
in
the
nation
in
connection
with
conservation
was
foreshadowed
by
what
i
strove
to
obtain
for
new
york
state
when
i
was
governor
and
i
was
already
working
in
connection
with
gifford
pinchot
and
newell
i
secured
better
administration
and
some
improvement
in
the
laws
themselves
the
improvement
in
administration
and
in
the
character
of
the
game
and
forest
wardens
was
secured
partly
as
the
result
of
a
conference
in
the
executive
chamber
which
i
held
with
forty
of
the
best
guides
and
woodsmen
of
the
adirondacks
as
regards
most
legislation
even
that
affecting
labor
and
the
forests
i
got
on
fairly
well
with
the
machine
but
on
the
two
issues
in
which
big
business
and
the
kind
of
politics
which
is
allied
to
big
business
were
most
involved
we
clashed
hard
and
clashing
with
senator
platt
meant
clashing
with
the
entire
republican
organization
and
with
the
organized
majority
in
each
house
of
the
legislature
one
clash
was
in
connection
with
the
superintendent
of
insurance
a
man
whose
office
made
him
a
factor
of
immense
importance
in
the
big
business
circles
of
new
york
the
then
incumbent
of
the
office
was
an
efficient
man
the
boss
of
an
county
a
veteran
politician
and
one
of
men
certain
investigations
which
i
made
in
the
course
of
the
fight
showed
that
this
superintendent
of
insurance
had
been
engaged
in
large
business
operations
in
new
york
city
these
operations
had
thrown
him
into
a
peculiarly
intimate
business
contact
of
one
sort
and
another
with
various
financiers
with
whom
i
did
not
deem
it
expedient
that
the
superintendent
of
insurance
while
such
should
have
any
intimate
and
secret
relations
moreover
the
gentleman
in
question
represented
the
straitest
sect
of
the
spoils
politicians
i
therefore
determined
not
to
reappoint
him
unless
i
could
get
his
successor
confirmed
however
he
would
stay
in
under
the
law
and
the
republican
machine
with
the
assistance
of
tammany
expected
to
control
far
more
than
a
majority
of
all
the
senators
platt
issued
an
ultimatum
to
me
that
the
incumbent
must
be
reappointed
or
else
that
he
would
fight
and
that
if
he
chose
to
fight
the
man
would
stay
in
anyhow
because
i
could
not
oust
him
for
under
the
new
york
constitution
the
assent
of
the
senate
was
necessary
not
only
to
appoint
a
man
to
office
but
to
remove
him
from
office
as
always
with
platt
i
persistently
refused
to
lose
my
temper
no
matter
what
he
said
he
was
much
too
old
and
physically
feeble
for
there
to
be
any
point
of
honor
in
taking
up
any
of
his
remarks
and
i
merely
explained
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
and
that
the
gentleman
in
question
would
not
be
retained
as
for
not
being
able
to
get
his
successor
confirmed
i
pointed
out
that
as
soon
as
the
legislature
adjourned
i
could
and
would
appoint
another
man
temporarily
platt
then
said
that
the
incumbent
would
be
put
back
as
soon
as
the
legislature
reconvened
i
admitted
that
this
was
possible
but
added
cheerfully
that
i
would
remove
him
again
just
as
soon
as
that
legislature
adjourned
and
that
even
though
i
had
an
uncomfortable
time
myself
i
would
guarantee
to
make
my
opponents
more
uncomfortable
still
we
parted
without
any
sign
of
reaching
an
agreement
there
remained
some
weeks
before
final
action
could
be
taken
and
the
senator
was
confident
that
i
would
have
to
yield
his
most
efficient
allies
were
the
pretended
reformers
most
of
them
my
open
or
covert
enemies
who
loudly
insisted
that
i
must
make
an
open
fight
on
the
senator
himself
and
on
the
republican
organization
this
was
what
he
wished
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
way
of
upsetting
him
within
the
republican
party
and
as
i
have
said
if
i
had
permitted
the
contest
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
mere
faction
fight
between
the
governor
and
the
united
states
senator
i
would
have
insured
the
victory
of
the
machine
so
i
blandly
refused
to
let
the
thing
become
a
personal
fight
explaining
again
and
again
that
i
was
perfectly
willing
to
appoint
an
organization
man
and
naming
two
or
three
whom
i
was
willing
to
appoint
but
also
explaining
that
i
would
not
retain
the
incumbent
and
would
not
appoint
any
man
of
his
type
meanwhile
pressure
on
behalf
of
the
said
incumbent
began
to
come
from
the
business
men
of
new
york
the
superintendent
of
insurance
was
not
a
man
whose
ill
will
the
big
life
insurance
companies
cared
to
incur
and
company
after
company
passed
resolutions
asking
me
to
reappoint
him
although
in
private
some
of
the
men
who
signed
these
resolutions
nervously
explained
that
they
did
not
mean
what
they
had
written
and
hoped
i
would
remove
the
man
a
citizen
prominent
in
reform
circles
marked
by
the
austerity
of
his
reform
professions
had
a
son
who
was
a
counsel
for
one
of
the
insurance
companies
the
father
was
engaged
in
writing
letters
to
the
papers
demanding
in
the
name
of
uncompromising
virtue
that
i
should
not
only
get
rid
of
the
superintendent
of
insurance
but
in
his
place
should
appoint
somebody
or
other
personally
offensive
to
senator
platt
which
last
proposition
if
adopted
would
have
meant
that
the
superintendent
of
insurance
would
have
stayed
in
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
given
meanwhile
the
son
came
to
see
me
on
behalf
of
the
insurance
company
he
represented
and
told
me
that
the
company
was
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
change
in
the
superintendency
that
if
i
really
meant
to
fight
they
thought
they
had
influence
with
four
of
the
state
senators
democrats
and
republicans
whom
they
could
get
to
vote
to
confirm
the
man
i
nominated
but
that
they
wished
to
be
sure
that
i
would
not
abandon
the
fight
because
it
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
them
if
i
started
the
fight
and
then
backed
down
i
told
my
visitor
that
he
need
be
under
no
apprehensions
that
i
would
certainly
see
the
fight
through
a
man
who
has
much
to
do
with
that
kind
of
politics
which
concerns
both
new
york
politicians
and
new
york
business
men
and
lawyers
is
not
easily
surprised
and
therefore
i
felt
no
other
emotion
than
a
rather
sardonic
amusement
when
hours
later
i
read
in
the
morning
paper
an
open
letter
from
the
officials
of
the
very
company
who
had
been
communicating
with
me
in
which
they
enthusiastically
advocated
the
renomination
of
the
superintendent
shortly
afterwards
my
visitor
the
young
lawyer
called
me
up
on
the
telephone
and
explained
that
the
officials
did
not
mean
what
they
had
said
in
this
letter
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
write
it
for
fear
of
the
superintendent
but
that
if
they
got
the
chance
they
intended
to
help
me
get
rid
of
him
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
thought
i
could
manage
the
fight
by
myself
i
did
not
hear
from
him
again
though
his
father
continued
to
write
public
demands
that
i
should
practice
pure
virtue
undefiled
and
offensive
meanwhile
senator
platt
declined
to
yield
i
had
picked
out
a
man
a
friend
of
his
who
i
believed
would
make
an
honest
and
competent
official
and
whose
position
in
the
organization
was
such
that
i
did
not
believe
the
senate
would
venture
to
reject
him
however
up
to
the
day
before
the
appointment
was
to
go
to
the
senate
platt
remained
unyielding
i
saw
him
that
afternoon
and
tried
to
get
him
to
yield
but
he
said
no
that
if
i
insisted
it
would
be
war
to
the
knife
and
my
destruction
and
perhaps
the
destruction
of
the
party
i
said
i
was
very
sorry
that
i
could
not
yield
and
if
the
war
came
it
would
have
to
come
and
that
next
morning
i
should
send
in
the
name
of
the
superintendent
successor
we
parted
and
soon
afterwards
i
received
from
the
man
who
was
at
the
moment
platt
lieutenant
a
request
to
know
where
he
could
see
me
that
evening
i
appointed
the
union
league
club
my
visitor
went
over
the
old
ground
explained
that
the
senator
would
under
no
circumstances
yield
that
he
was
certain
to
win
in
the
fight
that
my
reputation
would
be
destroyed
and
that
he
wished
to
save
me
from
such
a
lamentable
as
an
ending
to
my
career
i
could
only
repeat
what
i
had
already
said
and
after
half
an
hour
of
futile
argument
i
rose
and
said
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
further
talk
and
that
i
might
as
well
go
my
visitor
repeated
that
i
had
this
last
chance
and
that
ruin
was
ahead
of
me
if
i
refused
it
whereas
if
i
accepted
everything
would
be
made
easy
i
shook
my
head
and
answered
there
is
nothing
to
add
to
what
i
have
already
said
he
responded
you
have
made
up
your
mind
and
i
said
i
have
he
then
said
you
know
it
means
your
ruin
and
i
answered
well
we
will
see
about
that
and
walked
toward
the
door
he
said
you
understand
the
fight
will
begin
and
will
be
carried
on
to
the
bitter
end
i
said
yes
and
added
as
i
reached
the
door
good
night
then
as
the
door
opened
my
opponent
or
visitor
whichever
one
chooses
to
call
him
whose
face
was
as
impassive
and
as
inscrutable
as
that
of
john
hamlin
in
a
poker
game
said
hold
on
we
accept
send
in
the
man
i
had
named
the
senator
is
very
sorry
but
he
will
make
no
further
opposition
i
never
saw
a
bluff
carried
more
resolutely
through
to
the
final
limit
my
success
in
the
affair
coupled
with
the
appointment
of
partridge
and
hooker
secured
me
against
further
effort
to
interfere
with
my
handling
of
the
executive
departments
it
was
in
connection
with
the
insurance
business
that
i
first
met
george
perkins
he
came
to
me
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
the
then
speaker
of
the
national
house
of
representatives
tom
reed
which
ran
perkins
is
a
personal
friend
of
mine
whose
straightforwardness
and
intelligence
will
commend
to
you
whatever
he
has
to
say
if
you
will
give
him
proper
opportunity
to
explain
his
business
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
he
will
say
will
be
worthy
of
your
attention
perkins
wished
to
see
me
with
reference
to
a
bill
that
had
just
been
introduced
in
the
legislature
which
aimed
to
limit
the
aggregate
volume
of
insurance
that
any
new
york
state
company
could
assume
there
were
then
three
big
insurance
companies
in
new
york
the
mutual
life
equitable
and
new
york
life
perkins
was
a
of
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
and
john
mccall
was
its
president
i
had
just
finished
my
fight
against
the
superintendent
of
insurance
whom
i
refused
to
continue
in
office
mccall
had
written
me
a
very
strong
letter
urging
that
he
be
retained
and
had
done
everything
he
could
to
aid
senator
platt
in
securing
his
retention
the
mutual
life
and
equitable
people
had
openly
followed
the
same
course
but
in
private
had
hedged
they
were
both
backing
the
proposed
bill
mccall
was
opposed
to
it
he
was
in
california
and
just
before
starting
thither
he
had
been
told
by
the
mutual
life
and
equitable
that
the
limitation
bill
was
favored
by
me
and
would
be
put
through
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
mccall
did
not
know
me
and
on
leaving
for
california
told
perkins
that
from
all
he
could
learn
he
was
sure
i
was
bent
on
putting
this
bill
through
and
that
nothing
he
could
say
to
me
would
change
my
view
in
fact
because
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
retain
the
old
insurance
superintendent
he
felt
that
i
would
be
particularly
opposed
to
anything
he
might
wish
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
no
such
feeling
i
had
been
carefully
studying
the
question
i
had
talked
with
the
mutual
life
and
equitable
people
about
it
but
was
not
committed
to
any
particular
course
and
had
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
it
was
well
to
draw
the
line
on
size
instead
of
on
conduct
i
was
therefore
very
glad
to
see
perkins
and
get
a
new
point
of
view
i
went
over
the
matter
with
a
great
deal
of
care
and
at
considerable
length
and
after
we
had
thrashed
the
matter
out
pretty
fully
and
perkins
had
laid
before
me
in
detail
the
methods
employed
by
austria
germany
switzerland
and
other
european
countries
to
handle
their
large
insurance
companies
i
took
the
position
that
there
undoubtedly
were
evils
in
the
insurance
business
but
that
they
did
not
consist
in
insuring
people
lives
for
that
certainly
was
not
an
evil
and
i
did
not
see
how
the
real
evils
could
be
eradicated
by
limiting
or
suppressing
a
company
ability
to
protect
an
additional
number
of
lives
with
insurance
i
therefore
announced
that
i
would
not
favor
a
bill
that
limited
volume
of
business
and
would
not
sign
it
if
it
were
passed
but
that
i
favored
legislation
that
would
make
it
impossible
to
place
through
agents
policies
that
were
ambiguous
and
misleading
or
to
pay
exorbitant
prices
to
agents
for
business
or
to
invest
money
in
improper
securities
or
to
give
power
to
officers
to
use
the
company
funds
for
their
own
personal
profit
in
reaching
this
determination
i
was
helped
by
loeb
then
merely
a
stenographer
in
my
office
but
who
had
already
attracted
my
attention
both
by
his
efficiency
and
by
his
loyalty
to
his
former
employers
who
were
for
the
most
part
my
political
opponents
loeb
gave
me
much
information
about
various
improper
practices
in
the
insurance
business
i
began
to
gather
data
on
the
subject
with
the
intention
of
bringing
about
corrective
legislation
for
at
that
time
i
expected
to
continue
in
office
as
governor
but
in
a
few
weeks
i
was
nominated
as
and
my
successor
did
nothing
about
the
matter
so
far
as
i
remember
this
was
the
first
time
the
question
of
correcting
evils
in
a
business
by
limiting
the
volume
of
business
to
be
done
was
ever
presented
to
me
and
my
decision
in
the
matter
was
on
all
fours
with
the
position
i
have
always
since
taken
when
any
similar
principle
was
involved
at
the
time
when
i
made
my
decision
about
the
limitation
bill
i
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
mutual
and
equitable
people
who
were
back
of
it
whereas
i
did
not
know
mccall
at
all
and
perkins
only
from
hearing
him
discuss
the
bill
an
interesting
feature
of
the
matter
developed
subsequently
five
years
later
after
the
insurance
investigations
took
place
the
mutual
life
strongly
urged
the
passage
of
a
limitation
bill
and
because
of
the
popular
feeling
developed
by
the
exposure
of
the
improper
practices
of
the
companies
this
bill
was
generally
approved
governor
hughes
adopted
the
suggestion
such
a
bill
was
passed
by
the
legislature
and
governor
hughes
signed
it
this
bill
caused
the
three
great
new
york
companies
to
reduce
markedly
the
volume
of
business
they
were
doing
it
threw
a
great
many
agents
out
of
employment
and
materially
curtailed
the
foreign
business
of
the
companies
which
business
was
bringing
annually
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
this
country
for
investment
in
short
the
experiment
worked
so
badly
that
before
governor
hughes
went
out
of
office
one
of
the
very
last
bills
he
signed
was
one
that
permitted
the
life
insurance
companies
to
increase
their
business
each
year
by
an
amount
representing
a
certain
percentage
of
the
business
they
had
previously
done
this
in
practice
within
a
few
years
practically
annulled
the
limitation
bill
that
had
been
previously
passed
the
experiment
of
limiting
the
size
of
business
of
legislating
against
it
merely
because
it
was
big
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
so
completely
that
the
authors
of
the
bill
had
themselves
in
effect
repealed
it
my
action
in
refusing
to
try
the
experiment
had
been
completely
justified
as
a
sequel
to
this
incident
i
got
perkins
to
serve
on
the
palisade
park
commission
at
the
time
i
was
taking
active
part
in
the
effort
to
save
the
palisades
from
vandalism
and
destruction
by
getting
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
jointly
to
include
them
in
a
public
park
it
is
not
easy
to
get
a
responsible
and
capable
man
of
business
to
undertake
such
a
task
which
is
unpaid
which
calls
on
his
part
for
an
immense
expenditure
of
time
money
and
energy
which
offers
no
reward
of
any
kind
and
which
entails
the
certainty
of
abuse
and
misrepresentation
perkins
accepted
the
position
and
has
filled
it
for
the
last
thirteen
years
doing
as
disinterested
efficient
and
useful
a
bit
of
public
service
as
any
man
in
the
state
has
done
throughout
these
thirteen
years
the
case
of
most
importance
in
which
i
clashed
with
senator
platt
related
to
a
matter
of
fundamental
governmental
policy
and
was
the
first
step
i
ever
took
toward
bringing
big
corporations
under
effective
governmental
control
in
this
case
i
had
to
fight
the
democratic
machine
as
well
as
the
republican
machine
for
senator
hill
and
senator
platt
were
equally
opposed
to
my
action
and
the
big
corporation
men
the
big
business
men
back
of
both
of
them
took
precisely
the
same
view
of
these
matters
without
regard
to
their
party
feelings
on
other
points
what
i
did
convulsed
people
at
that
time
and
marked
the
beginning
of
the
effort
at
least
in
the
eastern
states
to
make
the
great
corporations
really
responsible
to
popular
wish
and
governmental
command
but
we
have
gone
so
far
past
the
stage
in
which
we
then
were
that
now
it
seems
incredible
that
there
should
have
been
any
opposition
at
all
to
what
i
at
that
time
proposed
the
substitution
of
electric
power
for
horse
power
in
the
street
car
lines
of
new
york
offered
a
fruitful
chance
for
the
most
noxious
type
of
dealing
between
business
men
and
politicians
the
franchises
granted
by
new
york
were
granted
without
any
attempt
to
secure
from
the
grantees
returns
in
the
way
of
taxation
or
otherwise
for
the
value
received
the
fact
that
they
were
thus
granted
by
improper
favoritism
a
favoritism
which
in
many
cases
was
unquestionably
secured
by
downright
bribery
led
to
all
kinds
of
trouble
in
return
for
the
continuance
of
these
improper
favors
to
the
corporations
the
politicians
expected
improper
favors
in
the
way
of
excessive
campaign
contributions
often
contributed
by
the
same
corporation
at
the
same
time
to
two
opposing
parties
before
i
became
governor
a
bill
had
been
introduced
into
the
new
york
legislature
to
tax
the
franchises
of
these
street
railways
it
affected
a
large
number
of
corporations
but
particularly
those
in
new
york
and
buffalo
it
had
been
suffered
to
slumber
undisturbed
as
none
of
the
people
in
power
dreamed
of
taking
it
seriously
and
both
the
republican
and
democratic
machines
were
hostile
to
it
under
the
rules
of
the
new
york
legislature
a
bill
could
always
be
taken
up
out
of
its
turn
and
passed
if
the
governor
sent
in
a
special
emergency
message
on
its
behalf
after
i
was
elected
governor
i
had
my
attention
directed
to
the
franchise
tax
matter
looked
into
the
subject
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
matter
of
plain
decency
and
honesty
that
these
companies
should
pay
a
tax
on
their
franchises
inasmuch
as
they
did
nothing
that
could
be
considered
as
service
rendered
the
public
in
lieu
of
a
tax
this
seemed
to
me
so
evidently
the
and
decent
thing
to
do
that
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
the
storm
of
protest
and
anger
which
my
proposal
aroused
senator
platt
and
the
other
machine
leaders
did
everything
to
get
me
to
abandon
my
intention
as
usual
i
saw
them
talked
the
matter
all
over
with
them
and
did
my
best
to
convert
them
to
my
way
of
thinking
senator
platt
i
believe
was
quite
sincere
in
his
opposition
he
did
not
believe
in
popular
rule
and
he
did
believe
that
the
big
business
men
were
entitled
to
have
things
their
way
he
profoundly
distrusted
the
people
naturally
enough
for
the
kind
of
human
nature
with
which
a
boss
comes
in
contact
is
not
of
an
exalted
type
he
felt
that
anarchy
would
come
if
there
was
any
interference
with
a
system
by
which
the
people
in
mass
were
under
various
necessary
cloaks
controlled
by
the
leaders
in
the
political
and
business
worlds
he
wrote
me
a
very
strong
letter
of
protest
against
my
attitude
expressed
in
dignified
friendly
and
temperate
language
but
using
one
word
in
a
curious
way
this
was
the
word
altruistic
he
stated
in
his
letter
that
he
had
not
objected
to
my
being
independent
in
politics
because
he
had
been
sure
that
i
had
the
good
of
the
party
at
heart
and
meant
to
act
fairly
and
honorably
but
that
he
had
been
warned
before
i
became
a
candidate
by
a
number
of
his
business
friends
that
i
was
a
dangerous
man
because
i
was
altruistic
and
that
he
now
feared
that
my
conduct
would
justify
the
alarm
thus
expressed
i
was
interested
in
this
not
only
because
senator
platt
was
obviously
sincere
but
because
of
the
way
in
which
he
used
altruistic
as
a
term
of
reproach
as
if
it
was
communistic
or
socialistic
the
last
being
a
word
he
did
use
to
me
when
as
now
and
then
happened
he
thought
that
my
proposals
warranted
fairly
reckless
vituperation
senator
platt
letter
ran
in
part
as
follows
when
the
subject
of
your
nomination
was
under
consideration
there
was
one
matter
that
gave
me
real
anxiety
i
think
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
appreciating
the
fact
that
it
was
the
matter
of
your
independence
i
think
we
have
got
far
enough
along
in
our
political
acquaintance
for
you
to
see
that
my
support
in
a
convention
does
not
imply
subsequent
nor
any
other
relation
that
may
not
reasonably
exist
for
the
welfare
of
the
party
the
thing
that
did
bother
me
was
this
i
had
heard
from
a
good
many
sources
that
you
were
a
little
loose
on
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
on
trusts
and
combinations
and
indeed
on
those
numerous
questions
which
have
recently
arisen
in
politics
affecting
the
security
of
earnings
and
the
right
of
a
man
to
run
his
own
business
in
his
own
way
with
due
respect
of
course
to
the
ten
commandments
and
the
penal
code
or
to
get
at
it
even
more
clearly
i
understood
from
a
number
of
business
men
and
among
them
many
of
your
own
personal
friends
that
you
entertained
various
altruistic
ideas
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
which
before
they
could
safely
be
put
into
law
needed
very
profound
consideration
you
have
just
adjourned
a
legislature
which
created
a
good
opinion
throughout
the
state
i
congratulate
you
heartily
upon
this
fact
because
i
sincerely
believe
as
everybody
else
does
that
this
good
impression
exists
very
largely
as
a
result
of
your
personal
influence
in
the
legislative
chambers
but
at
the
last
moment
and
to
my
very
great
surprise
you
did
a
thing
which
has
caused
the
business
community
of
new
york
to
wonder
how
far
the
notions
of
populism
as
laid
down
in
kansas
and
nebraska
have
taken
hold
upon
the
republican
party
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
my
answer
i
pointed
out
to
the
senator
that
i
had
as
governor
unhesitatingly
acted
at
buffalo
and
elsewhere
to
put
down
mobs
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
professed
leaders
of
labor
furiously
denounced
me
for
so
doing
but
that
i
could
no
more
tolerate
wrong
committed
in
the
name
of
property
than
wrong
committed
against
property
my
letter
ran
in
part
as
follows
i
knew
that
you
had
just
the
feelings
that
you
describe
that
is
apart
from
my
you
felt
that
there
was
a
justifiable
anxiety
among
men
of
means
and
especially
men
representing
large
corporate
interests
lest
i
might
feel
too
strongly
on
what
you
term
the
side
in
matters
of
labor
and
capital
and
as
regards
the
relations
of
the
state
to
great
corporations
i
know
that
when
parties
divide
on
such
issues
as
bryanism
the
tendency
is
to
force
everybody
into
one
of
two
camps
and
to
throw
out
entirely
men
like
myself
who
are
as
strongly
opposed
to
populism
in
every
stage
as
the
greatest
representative
of
corporate
wealth
but
who
also
feel
strongly
that
many
of
these
representatives
of
enormous
corporate
wealth
have
themselves
been
responsible
for
a
portion
of
the
conditions
against
which
bryanism
is
in
ignorant
revolt
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
wise
or
safe
for
us
as
a
party
to
take
refuge
in
mere
negation
and
to
say
that
there
are
no
evils
to
be
corrected
it
seems
to
me
that
our
attitude
should
be
one
of
correcting
the
evils
and
thereby
showing
that
whereas
the
populists
socialists
and
others
really
do
not
correct
the
evils
at
all
or
else
only
do
so
at
the
expense
of
producing
others
in
aggravated
form
on
the
contrary
we
republicans
hold
the
just
balance
and
set
ourselves
as
resolutely
against
improper
corporate
influence
on
the
one
hand
as
against
demagogy
and
mob
rule
on
the
other
i
understand
perfectly
that
such
an
attitude
of
moderation
is
apt
to
be
misunderstood
when
passions
are
greatly
excited
and
when
victory
is
apt
to
rest
with
the
extremists
on
one
side
or
the
other
yet
i
think
it
is
in
the
long
run
the
only
wise
attitude
i
appreciate
absolutely
what
platt
had
said
that
any
applause
i
get
will
be
too
evanescent
for
a
moment
consideration
i
appreciate
absolutely
that
the
people
who
now
loudly
approve
of
my
action
in
the
franchise
tax
bill
will
forget
all
about
it
in
a
fortnight
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
very
powerful
interests
adversely
affected
will
always
remember
it
the
leaders
urged
upon
me
that
i
personally
could
not
afford
to
take
this
action
for
under
no
circumstances
could
i
ever
again
be
nominated
for
any
public
office
as
no
corporation
would
subscribe
to
a
campaign
fund
if
i
was
on
the
ticket
and
that
they
would
subscribe
most
heavily
to
beat
me
and
when
i
asked
if
this
were
true
of
republican
corporations
the
cynical
answer
was
made
that
the
corporations
that
subscribed
most
heavily
to
the
campaign
funds
subscribed
impartially
to
both
party
organizations
under
all
these
circumstances
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
do
what
i
could
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
bill
these
two
letters
written
in
the
spring
of
express
clearly
the
views
of
the
two
elements
of
the
republican
party
whose
hostility
gradually
grew
until
it
culminated
thirteen
years
later
in
the
political
and
financial
forces
of
which
platt
had
once
been
the
spokesman
usurped
the
control
of
the
party
machinery
and
drove
out
of
the
party
the
men
who
were
loyally
endeavoring
to
apply
the
principles
of
the
founders
of
the
party
to
the
needs
and
issues
of
their
own
day
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
if
i
could
get
a
show
in
the
legislature
the
bill
would
pass
because
the
people
had
become
interested
and
the
representatives
would
scarcely
dare
to
vote
the
wrong
way
accordingly
on
april
i
sent
a
special
message
to
the
assembly
certifying
that
the
emergency
demanded
the
immediate
passage
of
the
bill
the
machine
leaders
were
bitterly
angry
and
the
speaker
actually
tore
up
the
message
without
reading
it
to
the
assembly
that
night
they
were
busy
trying
to
arrange
some
device
for
the
defeat
of
the
bill
which
was
not
difficult
as
the
session
was
about
to
close
at
seven
the
next
morning
i
was
informed
of
what
had
occurred
at
eight
i
was
in
the
capitol
at
the
executive
chamber
and
sent
in
another
special
message
which
opened
as
follows
i
learn
that
the
emergency
message
which
i
sent
last
evening
to
the
assembly
on
behalf
of
the
franchise
tax
bill
has
not
been
read
i
therefore
send
hereby
another
message
on
the
subject
i
need
not
impress
upon
the
assembly
the
need
of
passing
this
bill
at
once
i
sent
this
message
to
the
assembly
by
my
secretary
william
youngs
afterwards
united
states
district
attorney
of
kings
with
an
intimation
that
if
this
were
not
promptly
read
i
should
come
up
in
person
and
read
it
then
as
so
often
happens
the
opposition
collapsed
and
the
bill
went
through
both
houses
with
a
rush
i
had
in
the
house
stanch
friends
such
as
regis
post
and
alford
cooley
men
of
character
and
courage
who
would
have
fought
to
a
finish
had
the
need
arisen
my
troubles
were
not
at
an
end
however
the
bill
put
the
taxation
in
the
hands
of
the
local
county
boards
and
as
the
railways
sometimes
passed
through
several
different
counties
this
was
inadvisable
it
was
the
end
of
the
session
and
the
legislature
adjourned
the
corporations
affected
through
various
counsel
and
the
different
party
leaders
of
both
organizations
urged
me
not
to
sign
the
bill
laying
especial
stress
on
this
feature
and
asking
that
i
wait
until
the
following
year
when
a
good
measure
could
be
put
through
with
this
obnoxious
feature
struck
out
i
had
thirty
days
under
the
law
in
which
to
sign
the
bill
if
i
did
not
sign
it
by
the
end
of
that
time
it
would
not
become
a
law
i
answered
my
political
and
corporation
friends
by
telling
them
that
i
agreed
with
them
that
this
feature
was
wrong
but
that
i
would
rather
have
the
bill
with
this
feature
than
not
have
it
at
all
and
that
i
was
not
willing
to
trust
to
what
might
be
done
a
year
later
therefore
i
explained
i
would
reconvene
the
legislature
in
special
session
and
if
the
legislators
chose
to
amend
the
bill
by
placing
the
power
of
taxation
in
the
state
instead
of
in
the
county
or
municipality
i
would
be
glad
but
that
if
they
failed
to
amend
it
or
amended
it
improperly
i
would
sign
the
original
bill
and
let
it
become
law
as
it
was
when
the
representatives
of
platt
and
of
the
corporations
affected
found
they
could
do
no
better
they
assented
to
this
proposition
efforts
were
tentatively
made
to
outwit
me
by
inserting
amendments
that
would
nullify
the
effect
of
the
law
or
by
withdrawing
the
law
when
the
legislature
convened
which
would
at
once
have
deprived
me
of
the
whip
hand
on
may
i
wrote
senator
platt
outlining
the
amendments
i
desired
and
said
of
course
it
must
be
understood
that
i
will
sign
the
present
bill
if
the
proposed
bill
containing
the
changes
outlined
above
fails
to
pass
on
may
i
notified
the
senate
leader
john
raines
by
telegram
legislature
has
no
power
to
withdraw
the
ford
bill
if
attempt
is
made
to
do
so
i
will
sign
the
bill
at
once
on
the
same
day
by
telegram
i
wired
odell
concerning
the
bill
the
leaders
were
preparing
some
provisions
of
bill
very
objectionable
i
am
at
work
on
bill
to
show
you
the
bill
must
not
contain
greater
changes
than
those
outlined
in
my
message
my
wishes
were
heeded
and
when
i
had
reconvened
the
legislature
it
amended
the
bill
as
i
outlined
in
my
message
and
in
its
amended
form
the
bill
became
law
there
promptly
followed
something
which
afforded
an
index
of
the
good
faith
of
the
corporations
that
had
been
protesting
to
me
as
soon
as
the
change
for
which
they
had
begged
was
inserted
in
the
law
and
the
law
was
signed
they
turned
round
and
refused
to
pay
the
taxes
and
in
the
lawsuit
that
followed
they
claimed
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
because
it
contained
the
very
clause
which
they
had
so
clamorously
demanded
senator
david
hill
had
appeared
before
me
on
behalf
of
the
corporations
to
argue
for
the
change
and
he
then
appeared
before
the
courts
to
make
the
argument
on
the
other
side
the
suit
was
carried
through
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
which
declared
the
law
constitutional
during
the
time
that
i
was
president
one
of
the
painful
duties
of
the
chief
executive
in
states
like
new
york
as
well
as
in
the
nation
is
the
refusing
of
pardons
yet
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
necessary
from
the
standpoint
of
good
citizenship
than
the
ability
to
steel
one
heart
in
this
matter
of
granting
pardons
the
pressure
is
always
greatest
in
two
classes
of
cases
first
that
where
capital
punishment
is
inflicted
second
that
where
the
man
is
prominent
socially
and
in
the
business
world
and
where
in
consequence
his
crime
is
apt
to
have
been
one
concerned
in
some
way
with
finance
as
regards
capital
cases
the
trouble
is
that
emotional
men
and
women
always
see
only
the
individual
whose
fate
is
up
at
the
moment
and
neither
his
victim
nor
the
many
millions
of
unknown
individuals
who
would
in
the
long
run
be
harmed
by
what
they
ask
moreover
almost
any
criminal
however
brutal
has
usually
some
person
often
a
person
whom
he
has
greatly
wronged
who
will
plead
for
him
if
the
mother
is
alive
she
will
always
come
and
she
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
case
in
which
she
is
so
concerned
is
peculiar
that
in
this
case
a
pardon
should
be
granted
it
was
really
heartrending
to
have
to
see
the
kinsfolk
and
friends
of
murderers
who
were
condemned
to
death
and
among
the
very
rare
occasions
when
anything
governmental
or
official
caused
me
to
lose
sleep
were
the
times
when
i
had
to
listen
to
some
poor
mother
making
a
plea
for
a
criminal
so
wicked
so
utterly
brutal
and
depraved
that
it
would
have
been
a
crime
on
my
part
to
remit
his
punishment
on
the
other
hand
there
were
certain
crimes
where
requests
for
leniency
merely
made
me
angry
such
crimes
were
for
instance
rape
or
the
circulation
of
indecent
literature
or
anything
connected
with
what
would
now
be
called
the
white
slave
traffic
or
wife
murder
or
gross
cruelty
to
women
and
children
or
seduction
and
abandonment
or
the
action
of
some
man
in
getting
a
girl
whom
he
had
seduced
to
commit
abortion
i
am
speaking
in
each
instance
of
cases
that
actually
came
before
me
either
while
i
was
governor
or
while
i
was
president
in
an
astonishing
number
of
these
cases
men
of
high
standing
signed
petitions
or
wrote
letters
asking
me
to
show
leniency
to
the
criminal
in
two
or
three
of
the
cases
one
where
some
young
roughs
had
committed
rape
on
a
helpless
immigrant
girl
and
another
in
which
a
physician
of
wealth
and
high
standing
had
seduced
a
girl
and
then
induced
her
to
commit
abortion
i
rather
lost
my
temper
and
wrote
to
the
individuals
who
had
asked
for
the
pardon
saying
that
i
extremely
regretted
that
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
increase
the
sentence
i
then
let
the
facts
be
made
public
for
i
thought
that
my
petitioners
deserved
public
censure
whether
they
received
this
public
censure
or
not
i
did
not
know
but
that
my
action
made
them
very
angry
i
do
know
and
their
anger
gave
me
real
satisfaction
the
list
of
these
petitioners
was
a
fairly
long
one
and
included
two
united
states
senators
a
governor
of
a
state
two
judges
an
editor
and
some
eminent
lawyers
and
business
men
in
the
class
of
cases
where
the
offense
was
one
involving
the
misuse
of
large
sums
of
money
the
reason
for
the
pressure
was
different
cases
of
this
kind
more
frequently
came
before
me
when
i
was
president
but
they
also
came
before
me
when
i
was
governor
chiefly
in
the
cases
of
county
treasurers
who
had
embezzled
funds
a
big
bank
president
a
railway
magnate
an
official
connected
with
some
big
corporation
or
a
government
official
in
a
responsible
fiduciary
position
necessarily
belongs
among
the
men
who
have
succeeded
in
life
this
means
that
his
family
are
living
in
comfort
and
perhaps
luxury
and
refinement
and
that
his
sons
and
daughters
have
been
well
educated
in
such
a
case
the
misdeed
of
the
father
comes
as
a
crushing
disaster
to
the
wife
and
children
and
the
people
of
the
community
however
bitter
originally
against
the
man
grow
to
feel
the
most
intense
sympathy
for
the
women
and
children
who
suffer
for
the
man
fault
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
in
life
that
so
much
of
atonement
for
is
vicarious
if
it
were
possible
in
such
a
case
to
think
only
of
the
banker
or
county
treasurer
wife
and
children
any
man
would
pardon
the
offender
at
once
unfortunately
it
is
not
right
to
think
only
of
the
women
and
children
the
very
fact
that
in
cases
of
this
class
there
is
certain
to
be
pressure
from
high
sources
pressure
sometimes
by
men
who
have
been
beneficially
even
though
remotely
interested
in
the
man
criminality
no
less
than
pressure
because
of
honest
sympathy
with
the
wife
and
children
makes
it
necessary
that
the
good
public
servant
shall
no
matter
how
deep
his
sympathy
and
regret
steel
his
heart
and
do
his
duty
by
refusing
to
let
the
out
my
experience
of
the
way
in
which
pardons
are
often
granted
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
do
not
believe
that
life
imprisonment
for
murder
and
rape
is
a
proper
substitute
for
the
death
penalty
the
average
term
of
life
imprisonment
in
this
country
is
only
about
fourteen
years
of
course
there
were
cases
where
i
either
commuted
sentences
or
pardoned
offenders
with
very
real
pleasure
for
instance
when
president
i
frequently
commuted
sentences
for
horse
stealing
in
the
indian
territory
because
the
penalty
for
stealing
a
horse
was
disproportionate
to
the
penalty
for
many
other
crimes
and
the
offense
was
usually
committed
by
some
ignorant
young
fellow
who
found
a
horse
and
really
did
not
commit
anything
like
as
serious
an
offense
as
the
penalty
indicated
the
judges
would
be
obliged
to
give
the
minimum
penalty
but
would
forward
me
memoranda
stating
that
if
there
had
been
a
less
penalty
they
would
have
inflicted
it
and
i
would
then
commute
the
sentence
to
the
penalty
thus
indicated
in
one
case
in
new
york
i
pardoned
outright
a
man
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
and
i
did
this
on
the
recommendation
of
a
friend
father
doyle
of
the
paulist
fathers
i
had
become
intimate
with
the
paulist
fathers
while
i
was
police
commissioner
and
i
had
grown
to
feel
confidence
in
their
judgment
for
i
had
found
that
they
always
told
me
exactly
what
the
facts
were
about
any
man
whether
he
belonged
to
their
church
or
not
in
this
case
the
convicted
man
was
a
strongly
built
respectable
old
irishman
employed
as
a
watchman
around
some
big
establishments
the
young
roughs
of
the
neighborhood
which
was
then
of
a
rather
lawless
type
used
to
try
to
destroy
the
property
of
the
companies
in
a
conflict
with
a
watchman
a
member
of
one
of
the
gangs
was
slain
the
watchman
was
acquitted
but
the
neighborhood
was
much
wrought
up
over
the
acquittal
shortly
afterwards
a
gang
of
the
same
roughs
attacked
another
watchman
the
old
irishman
in
question
and
finally
to
save
his
own
life
he
was
obliged
in
to
kill
one
of
his
assailants
the
feeling
in
the
community
however
was
strongly
against
him
and
some
of
the
men
high
up
in
the
corporation
became
frightened
and
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
throw
over
the
watchman
he
was
convicted
father
doyle
came
to
me
told
me
that
he
knew
the
man
well
that
he
was
one
of
the
best
members
of
his
church
admirable
in
every
way
that
he
had
simply
been
forced
to
fight
for
his
life
while
loyally
doing
his
duty
and
that
the
conviction
represented
the
triumph
of
the
tough
element
of
the
district
and
the
abandonment
of
this
man
by
those
who
should
have
stood
by
him
under
the
influence
of
an
unworthy
fear
i
looked
into
the
case
came
to
the
conclusion
that
father
doyle
was
right
and
gave
the
man
a
full
pardon
before
he
had
served
thirty
days
the
various
clashes
between
myself
and
the
machine
my
triumph
in
them
and
the
fact
that
the
people
were
getting
more
and
more
interested
and
aroused
brought
on
a
curious
situation
in
the
republican
national
convention
at
philadelphia
in
june
senator
platt
and
the
new
york
machine
leaders
had
become
very
anxious
to
get
me
out
of
the
governorship
chiefly
because
of
the
hostility
of
the
big
corporation
men
towards
me
but
they
had
also
become
convinced
that
there
was
such
popular
feeling
on
my
behalf
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
refuse
me
a
renomination
if
i
demanded
it
they
accordingly
decided
to
push
me
for
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
there
was
at
that
time
a
good
deal
of
feeling
for
me
in
the
country
at
large
see
appendix
b
to
this
chapter
i
myself
did
not
appreciate
that
there
was
any
such
feeling
and
as
i
greatly
disliked
the
office
of
and
was
much
interested
in
the
governorship
i
announced
that
i
would
not
accept
the
i
was
one
of
the
delegates
to
philadelphia
on
reaching
there
i
found
that
the
situation
was
complicated
senator
hanna
appeared
on
the
surface
to
have
control
of
the
convention
he
was
anxious
that
i
should
not
be
nominated
as
senator
platt
was
anxious
that
i
should
be
nominated
as
in
order
to
get
me
out
of
the
new
york
governorship
each
took
a
position
opposite
to
that
of
the
other
but
each
at
that
time
cordially
sympathized
with
the
other
feelings
about
me
it
was
the
manifestations
and
not
the
feelings
that
differed
my
supporters
in
new
york
state
did
not
wish
me
nominated
for
because
they
wished
me
to
continue
as
governor
but
in
every
other
state
all
the
people
who
admired
me
were
bound
that
i
should
be
nominated
as
these
people
were
almost
all
desirous
of
seeing
mckinley
renominated
as
president
but
they
became
angry
at
senator
hanna
opposition
to
me
as
he
in
his
turn
suddenly
became
aware
that
if
he
persisted
he
might
find
that
in
their
anger
these
men
would
oppose
mckinley
renomination
and
although
they
could
not
have
prevented
the
nomination
such
opposition
would
have
been
a
serious
blow
in
the
campaign
which
was
to
follow
senator
hanna
therefore
began
to
waver
meanwhile
a
meeting
of
the
new
york
delegation
was
called
most
of
the
delegates
were
under
the
control
of
senator
platt
the
senator
notified
me
that
if
i
refused
to
accept
the
nomination
for
i
would
be
beaten
for
the
nomination
for
governor
i
answered
that
i
would
accept
the
challenge
that
we
would
have
a
fight
on
the
proposition
and
that
i
would
begin
it
at
once
by
telling
the
assembled
delegates
of
the
threat
and
giving
fair
warning
that
i
intended
to
fight
for
the
governorship
nomination
and
moreover
that
i
intended
to
get
it
this
brought
senator
platt
to
terms
the
effort
to
instruct
the
new
york
delegation
for
me
was
abandoned
and
woodruff
was
presented
for
nomination
in
my
place
i
supposed
that
this
closed
the
incident
and
that
no
further
effort
would
be
made
to
nominate
me
for
the
on
the
contrary
the
effect
was
directly
the
reverse
the
upset
of
the
new
york
machine
increased
the
feeling
of
the
delegates
from
other
states
that
it
was
necessary
to
draft
me
for
the
nomination
by
next
day
senator
hanna
himself
concluded
that
this
was
a
necessity
and
acquiesced
in
the
movement
as
new
york
was
already
committed
against
me
and
as
i
was
not
willing
that
there
should
be
any
chance
of
supposing
that
the
new
yorkers
had
nominated
me
to
get
rid
of
me
the
result
was
that
i
was
nominated
and
seconded
from
outside
states
no
other
candidate
was
placed
in
the
field
by
this
time
the
legislature
had
adjourned
and
most
of
my
work
as
governor
of
new
york
was
over
one
unexpected
bit
of
business
arose
however
it
was
the
year
of
the
presidential
campaign
tammany
which
had
been
lukewarm
about
bryan
in
cordially
supported
him
in
and
when
tammany
heartily
supports
a
candidate
it
is
well
for
the
opposing
candidate
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
election
frauds
the
city
government
was
in
the
hands
of
tammany
but
i
had
power
to
remove
the
mayor
the
sheriff
and
the
district
attorney
for
malfeasance
or
misfeasance
in
office
such
power
had
not
been
exercised
by
any
previous
governor
as
far
as
i
knew
but
it
existed
and
if
the
misfeasance
or
malfeasance
warranted
it
and
if
the
governor
possessed
the
requisite
determination
the
power
could
be
and
ought
to
be
exercised
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
a
state
bureau
of
elections
had
been
created
in
new
york
city
and
a
superintendent
of
elections
appointed
by
the
governor
the
chief
of
the
state
bureau
of
elections
was
john
mccullagh
formerly
in
the
police
department
when
i
was
police
commissioner
the
chief
of
police
for
the
city
was
william
devery
one
of
the
tammany
leaders
who
represented
in
the
police
department
all
that
i
had
warred
against
while
commissioner
on
november
devery
directed
his
subordinates
in
the
police
department
to
disregard
the
orders
which
mccullagh
had
given
to
his
deputies
orders
which
were
essential
if
we
were
to
secure
an
honest
election
in
the
city
i
had
just
returned
from
a
western
campaign
trip
and
was
at
sagamore
hill
i
had
no
direct
power
over
devery
but
the
mayor
had
and
i
had
power
over
the
mayor
accordingly
i
at
once
wrote
to
the
mayor
of
new
york
to
the
sheriff
of
new
york
and
to
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
the
following
letters

november
to
the
mayor
of
the
city
of

sir
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
official
order
issued
by
chief
of

devery
in
which
he
directs
his
subordinates
to
disregard
the
chief
of
the
state
election
bureau
john
mccullagh
and
his
deputies
unless
you
have
already
taken
steps
to
secure
the
recall
of
this
order
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
point
out
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
hold
you
responsible
as
the
head
of
the
city
government
for
the
action
of
the
chief
of
police
if
it
should
result
in
any
breach
of
the
peace
and
intimidation
or
any
crime
whatever
against
the
election
laws
the
state
and
city
authorities
should
work
together
i
will
not
fail
to
call
to
summary
account
either
state
or
city
authority
in
the
event
of
either
being
guilty
of
intimidation
or
connivance
at
fraud
or
of
failure
to
protect
every
legal
voter
in
his
rights
i
therefore
hereby
notify
you
that
in
the
event
of
any
following
upon
the
failure
immediately
to
recall
chief
devery
order
or
upon
any
action
or
inaction
on
the
part
of
chief
devery
i
must
necessarily
call
you
to
account
yours
theodore

state
of

november
to
the
sheriff
of
the

of

sir
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
official

issued
by

it

and
i
shall
hold
you
strictly
responsible
for
any

for
any

truly
theodore

to
the
district

of
the

sir
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
official
order
issued
by
chief
of

in
which
he
directs
his
subordinates
to

john

in

of
this

i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
your
duty
to
assist
in
the
orderly

there
must
be
no
failure
on
your
part
to
do
your
full
duty
in
the
matter
yours
truly
theodore
roosevelt
these
letters
had
the
desired
effect
the
mayor
promptly
required
chief
devery
to
rescind
the
obnoxious
order
which
was
as
promptly
done
the
sheriff
also
took
prompt
action
the
district
attorney
refused
to
heed
my
letter
and
assumed
an
attitude
of
defiance
and
i
removed
him
from
office
on
election
day
there
was
no
clash
between
the
city
and
state
authorities
the
election
was
orderly
and
honest
appendix
a
conservation
as
foreshadowing
the
course
i
later
as
president
followed
in
this
matter
i
give
extracts
from
one
of
my
letters
to
the
commission
and
from
my
second
and
last
annual
message
i
spent
the
first
months
of
my
term
in
investigations
to
find
out
just
what
the
situation
was
on
november
i
wrote
to
the
commission
as
follows
i
have
had
very
many
complaints
before
this
as
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
game
wardens
and
game
protectors
the
complaints
usually
taking
the
form
that
the
men
have
been
appointed
and
are
retained
without
due
regard
to
the
duties
to
be
performed
i
do
not
wish
a
man
to
be
retained
or
appointed
who
is
not
thoroughly
fit
to
perform
the
duties
of
game
protector
the
adirondacks
are
entitled
to
a
peculiar
share
of
the
commission
attention
both
from
the
standpoint
of
forestry
and
from
the
less
important
but
still
very
important
standpoint
of
game
and
fish
protection
the
men
who
do
duty
as
game
protectors
in
the
adirondacks
should
by
preference
be
appointed
from
the
locality
itself
and
should
in
all
cases
be
thorough
woodsmen
the
mere
fact
that
a
game
protector
has
to
hire
a
guide
to
pilot
him
through
the
woods
is
enough
to
show
his
unfitness
for
the
position
i
want
as
game
protectors
men
of
courage
resolution
and
hardihood
who
can
handle
the
rifle
ax
and
paddle
who
can
camp
out
in
summer
or
winter
who
can
go
on
if
necessary
who
can
go
through
the
woods
by
day
or
by
night
without
regard
to
trails
i
should
like
full
information
about
all
your
employees
as
to
their
capacities
as
to
the
labor
they
perform
as
to
their
distribution
from
and
where
they
do
their
work
many
of
the
men
hitherto
appointed
owed
their
positions
principally
to
political
preference
the
changes
i
recommended
were
promptly
made
and
much
to
the
good
of
the
public
service
in
my
annual
message
in
january
i
said
great
progress
has
been
made
through
the
fish
hatcheries
in
the
propagation
of
valuable
food
and
sporting
fish
the
laws
for
the
protection
of
deer
have
resulted
in
their
increase
nevertheless
as
railroads
tend
to
encroach
on
the
wilderness
the
temptation
to
illegal
hunting
becomes
greater
and
the
danger
from
forest
fires
increases
there
is
need
of
great
improvement
both
in
our
laws
and
in
their
administration
the
game
wardens
have
been
too
few
in
number
more
should
be
provided
none
save
fit
men
must
be
appointed
and
their
retention
in
office
must
depend
purely
upon
the
zeal
ability
and
efficiency
with
which
they
perform
their
duties
the
game
wardens
in
the
forests
must
be
woodsmen
and
they
should
have
no
outside
business
in
short
there
should
be
a
thorough
reorganization
of
the
work
of
the
commission
a
careful
study
of
the
resources
and
condition
of
the
forests
on
state
land
must
be
made
it
is
certainly
not
too
much
to
expect
that
the
state
forests
should
be
managed
as
efficiently
as
the
forests
on
private
lands
in
the
same
neighborhoods
and
the
measure
of
difference
in
efficiency
of
management
must
be
the
measure
of
condemnation
or
praise
of
the
way
the
public
forests
have
been
managed
the
subject
of
forest
preservation
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
state
the
adirondacks
and
catskills
should
be
great
parks
kept
in
perpetuity
for
the
benefit
and
enjoyment
of
our
people
much
has
been
done
of
late
years
towards
their
preservation
but
very
much
remains
to
be
done
the
provisions
of
law
in
reference
to
sawmills
and
mills
are
defective
and
should
be
changed
so
as
to
prohibit
dumping
sawdust
or
in
any
amount
whatsoever
into
the
streams
reservoirs
should
be
made
but
not
where
they
will
tend
to
destroy
large
sections
of
the
forest
and
only
after
a
careful
and
scientific
study
of
the
water
resources
of
the
region
the
people
of
the
forest
regions
are
themselves
growing
more
and
more
to
realize
the
necessity
of
preserving
both
the
trees
and
the
game
a
live
deer
in
the
woods
will
attract
to
the
neighborhood
ten
times
the
money
that
could
be
obtained
for
the
deer
dead
carcass
timber
theft
on
the
state
lands
is
of
course
a
grave
offense
against
the
whole
public
hardy
outdoor
sports
like
hunting
are
in
themselves
of
no
small
value
to
the
national
character
and
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
men
who
go
into
the
wilderness
indeed
men
who
take
part
in
any
field
sports
with
horse
or
rifle
receive
a
benefit
which
can
hardly
be
given
by
even
the
most
vigorous
athletic
games
there
is
a
further
and
more
immediate
and
practical
end
in
view
a
primeval
forest
is
a
great
sponge
which
absorbs
and
distills
the
rain
water
and
when
it
is
destroyed
the
result
is
apt
to
be
an
alternation
of
flood
and
drought
forest
fires
ultimately
make
the
land
a
desert
and
are
a
detriment
to
all
that
portion
of
the
state
tributary
to
the
streams
through
the
woods
where
they
occur
every
effort
should
be
made
to
minimize
their
destructive
influence
we
need
to
have
our
system
of
forestry
gradually
developed
and
conducted
along
scientific
principles
when
this
has
been
done
it
will
be
possible
to
allow
marketable
lumber
to
be
cut
everywhere
without
damage
to
the
forests
indeed
with
positive
advantage
to
them
but
until
lumbering
is
thus
conducted
on
strictly
scientific
principles
no
less
than
upon
principles
of
the
strictest
honesty
toward
the
state
we
can
not
afford
to
suffer
it
at
all
in
the
state
forests
unrestrained
greed
means
the
ruin
of
the
great
woods
and
the
drying
up
of
the
sources
of
the
rivers
ultimately
the
administration
of
the
state
lands
must
be
so
centralized
as
to
enable
us
definitely
to
place
responsibility
in
respect
to
everything
concerning
them
and
to
demand
the
highest
degree
of
trained
intelligence
in
their
use
the
state
should
not
permit
within
its
limits
factories
to
make
bird
skins
or
bird
feathers
into
articles
of
ornament
or
wearing
apparel
ordinary
birds
and
especially
song
birds
should
be
rigidly
protected
game
birds
should
never
be
shot
to
a
greater
extent
than
will
offset
the
natural
rate
of
increase
care
should
be
taken
not
to
encourage
the
use
of
cold
storage
or
other
market
systems
which
are
a
benefit
to
no
one
but
the
wealthy
epicure
who
can
afford
to
pay
a
heavy
price
for
luxuries
these
systems
tend
to
the
destruction
of
the
game
which
would
bear
most
severely
upon
the
very
men
whose
rapacity
has
been
appealed
to
in
order
to
secure
its
extermination
i
reorganized
the
commission
putting
austin
wadsworth
at
its
head
appendix
b
the
political
situation
in
my
general
scheme
of
action
as
governor
was
given
in
a
letter
i
wrote
one
of
my
supporters
among
the
independent
district
organization
leaders
norton
goddard
on
april
it
runs
in
part
as
follows
nobody
can
tell
and
least
of
all
the
machine
itself
whether
the
machine
intends
to
renominate
me
next
fall
or
not
if
for
some
reason
i
should
be
weak
whether
on
account
of
faults
or
virtues
doubtless
the
machine
will
throw
me
over
and
i
think
i
am
not
uncharitable
when
i
say
they
would
feel
no
acute
grief
at
so
doing
it
would
be
very
strange
if
they
did
feel
such
grief
if
for
instance
we
had
strikes
which
led
to
riots
i
would
of
course
be
obliged
to
preserve
order
and
stop
the
riots
decent
citizens
would
demand
that
i
should
do
it
and
in
any
event
i
should
do
it
wholly
without
regard
to
their
demands
but
once
it
was
done
they
would
forget
all
about
it
while
a
great
many
laboring
men
honest
but
ignorant
and
prejudiced
would
bear
a
grudge
against
me
for
doing
it
this
might
put
me
out
of
the
running
as
a
candidate
again
the
big
corporations
undoubtedly
want
to
beat
me
they
prefer
the
chance
of
being
blackmailed
to
the
certainty
that
they
will
not
be
allowed
any
more
than
their
due
of
course
they
will
try
to
beat
me
on
some
entirely
different
issue
and
as
they
are
very
able
and
very
unscrupulous
nobody
can
tell
that
they
wo
succeed
i
have
been
trying
to
stay
in
with
the
organization
i
did
not
do
it
with
the
idea
that
they
would
renominate
me
i
did
it
with
the
idea
of
getting
things
done
and
in
that
i
have
been
absolutely
successful
whether
senator
platt
and
odell
endeavor
to
beat
me
or
do
beat
me
for
the
renomination
next
fall
is
of
very
small
importance
compared
to
the
fact
that
for
my
two
years
i
have
been
able
to
make
a
republican
majority
in
the
legislature
do
good
and
decent
work
and
have
prevented
any
split
within
the
party
the
task
was
one
of
great
difficulty
because
on
the
one
hand
i
had
to
keep
clearly
before
me
the
fact
that
it
was
better
to
have
a
split
than
to
permit
bad
work
to
be
done
and
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
to
have
that
split
would
absolutely
prevent
all
work
the
result
has
been
that
i
have
avoided
a
split
and
that
as
a
net
result
of
my
two
years
and
the
two
sessions
of
the
legislature
there
has
been
an
enormous
improvement
in
the
administration
of
the
government
and
there
has
also
been
a
great
advance
in
legislation
to
show
my
reading
of
the
situation
at
the
time
i
quote
from
a
letter
of
mine
to
joseph
bishop
then
editor
of
the
with
whom
towards
the
end
of
my
term
i
had
grown
into
very
close
relations
and
who
together
with
two
other
old
friends
albert
shaw
of
the

now

of
the
knew
the
inside
of
every
movement
so
far
as
i
knew
it
myself
the
letter
which
is
dated
april
runs
in
part
as
follows
the
dangerous
element
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
comes
from
the
corporations
the
naming
certain
men
crowd
and
those
like
them
have
been
greatly
exasperated
by
the
franchise
tax
they
would
like
to
get
me
out
of
politics
for
good
but
at
the
moment
they
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
put
me
into
the
naturally
i
will
not
be
opposed
openly
on
the
ground
of
the
corporations
grievance
but
every
kind
of
false
statement
will
continually
be
made
and
men
like
naming
the
editors
of
certain
newspapers
will
attack
me
not
as
the
enemy
of
corporations
but
as
their
tool
there
is
no
question
whatever
that
if
the
leaders
can
they
will
upset
me
one
position
which
as
governor
and
as
president
i
consistently
took
seems
to
me
to
represent
what
ought
to
be
a
fundamental
principle
in
american
legislative
work
i
steadfastly
refused
to
advocate
any
law
no
matter
how
admirable
in
theory
if
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
that
in
practice
it
would
not
be
executed
i
have
always
sympathized
with
the
view
set
forth
by
pelatiah
webster
in
quoted
by
hannis
taylor
in
his
of
the
supreme
laws
or
ordinances
of
any
kind
especially
of
august
bodies
of
high
dignity
and
consequence
which
fail
of
execution
are
much
worse
than
none
they
weaken
the
government
expose
it
to
contempt
destroy
the
confidence
of
all
men
native
and
foreigners
in
it
and
expose
both
aggregate
bodies
and
individuals
who
have
placed
confidence
in
it
to
many
ruinous
disappointments
which
they
would
have
escaped
had
no
such
law
or
ordinance
been
made
this
principle
by
the
way
not
only
applies
to
an
internal
law
which
can
not
be
executed
it
applies
even
more
to
international
action
such
as
a
universal
arbitration
treaty
which
can
not
and
will
not
be
kept
and
most
of
all
it
applies
to
proposals
to
make
such
universal
arbitration
treaties
at
the
very
time
that
we
are
not
keeping
our
solemn
promise
to
execute
limited
arbitration
treaties
which
we
have
already
made
a
general
arbitration
treaty
is
merely
a
promise
it
represents
merely
a
debt
of
honorable
obligation
and
nothing
is
more
discreditable
for
a
nation
or
an
individual
than
to
cover
up
the
repudiation
of
a
debt
which
can
be
and
ought
to
be
paid
by
recklessly
promising
to
incur
a
new
and
insecure
debt
which
no
wise
man
for
one
moment
supposes
ever
will
be
paid
chapter
ix
outdoors
and
indoors
there
are
men
who
love
who
yet
never
open
a
book
and
other
men
who
love
books
but
to
whom
the
great
book
of
nature
is
a
sealed
volume
and
the
lines
written
therein
blurred
and
illegible
nevertheless
among
those
men
whom
i
have
known
the
love
of
books
and
the
love
of
outdoors
in
their
highest
expressions
have
usually
gone
hand
in
hand
it
is
an
affectation
for
the
man
who
is
praising
outdoors
to
sneer
at
books
usually
the
keenest
appreciation
of
what
is
seen
in
nature
is
to
be
found
in
those
who
have
also
profited
by
the
hoarded
and
recorded
wisdom
of
their
love
of
outdoor
life
love
of
simple
and
hardy
pastimes
can
be
gratified
by
men
and
women
who
do
not
possess
large
means
and
who
work
hard
and
so
can
love
of
good
books
not
of
good
bindings
and
of
first
editions
excellent
enough
in
their
way
but
sheer
luxuries
i
mean
love
of
reading
books
owning
them
if
possible
of
course
but
if
that
is
not
possible
getting
them
from
a

library
sagamore
hill
takes
its
name
from
the
old
sagamore
mohannis
who
as
chief
of
his
little
tribe
signed
away
his
rights
to
the
land
two
centuries
and
a
half
ago
the
house
stands
right
on
the
top
of
the
hill
separated
by
fields
and
belts
of
woodland
from
all
other
houses
and
looks
out
over
the
bay
and
the
sound
we
see
the
sun
go
down
beyond
long
reaches
of
land
and
of
water
many
birds
dwell
in
the
trees
round
the
house
or
in
the
pastures
and
the
woods
near
by
and
of
course
in
winter
gulls
loons
and
wild
fowl
frequent
the
waters
of
the
bay
and
the
sound
we
love
all
the
seasons
the
snows
and
bare
woods
of
winter
the
rush
of
growing
things
and
the
of
spring
the
yellow
grain
the
ripening
fruits
and
tasseled
corn
and
the
deep
leafy
shades
that
are
heralded
by
the
green
dance
of
summer
and
the
sharp
fall
winds
that
tear
the
brilliant
banners
with
which
the
trees
greet
the
dying
year
the
sound
is
always
lovely
in
the
summer
nights
we
watch
it
from
the
piazza
and
see
the
lights
of
the
tall
fall
river
boats
as
they
steam
steadily
by
now
and
then
we
spend
a
day
on
it
the
two
of
us
together
in
the
light
rowing
skiff
or
perhaps
with
one
of
the
boys
to
pull
an
extra
pair
of
oars
we
land
for
lunch
at
noon
under
oaks
on
the
edge
of
a
low
bluff
or
among
the
wild
plum
bushes
on
a
spit
of
white
sand
while
the
sails
of
the
coasting
schooners
gleam
in
the
sunlight
and
the
tolling
of
the
comes
landward
across
the
waters
long
island
is
not
as
rich
in
flowers
as
the
valley
of
the
hudson
yet
there
are
many
early
in
april
there
is
one
hillside
near
us
which
glows
like
a
tender
flame
with
the
white
of
the
bloodroot
about
the
same
time
we
find
the
shy
mayflower
the
trailing
arbutus
and
although
we
rarely
pick
wild
flowers
one
member
of
the
household
always
plucks
a
little
bunch
of
mayflowers
to
send
to
a
friend
working
in
panama
whose
soul
hungers
for
the
northern
spring
then
there
are
shadblow
and
delicate
anemones
about
the
time
of
the
cherry
blossoms
the
brief
glory
of
the
apple
orchards
follows
and
then
the
thronging
dogwoods
fill
the
forests
with
their
radiance
and
so
flowers
follow
flowers
until
the
springtime
splendor
closes
with
the
laurel
and
the
evanescent
locust
bloom
the
late
summer
flowers
follow
the
flaunting
lilies
and
cardinal
flowers
and
marshmallows
and
pale
beach
rosemary
and
the
goldenrod
and
the
asters
when
the
afternoons
shorten
and
we
again
begin
to
think
of
fires
in
the
wide
fireplaces
most
of
the
birds
in
our
neighborhood
are
the
ordinary
home
friends
of
the
house
and
the
barn
the
wood
lot
and
the
pasture
but
now
and
then
the
species
make
queer
shifts
the
cheery
quail
alas
are
rarely
found
near
us
now
and
we
no
longer
hear
the
at
night
but
some
birds
visit
us
now
which
formerly
did
not
when
i
was
a
boy
neither
the
green
warbler
nor
the
purple
finch
nested
around
us
nor
were
bobolinks
found
in
our
fields
the
green
warbler
is
now
one
of
our
commonest
summer
warblers
there
are
plenty
of
purple
finches
and
best
of
all
the
bobolinks
are
far
from
infrequent
i
had
written
about
these
new
visitors
to
john
burroughs
and
once
when
he
came
out
to
see
me
i
was
able
to
show
them
to
him
when
i
was
president
we
owned
a
little
house
in
western
virginia
a
delightful
house
to
us
at
least
although
only
a
shell
of
rough
boards
we
used
sometimes
to
go
there
in
the
fall
perhaps
at
thanksgiving
and
on
these
occasions
we
would
have
quail
and
rabbits
of
our
own
shooting
and
once
in
a
while
a
wild
turkey
we
also
went
there
in
the
spring
of
course
many
of
the
birds
were
different
from
our
long
island
friends
there
were
the
most
attractive
of
all
birds
and
blue
grosbeaks
and
cardinals
and
summer
redbirds
instead
of
scarlet
tanagers
and
those
wonderful
singers
the
bewick
wrens
and
carolina
wrens
all
these
i
was
able
to
show
john
burroughs
when
he
came
to
visit
us
although
by
the
way
he
did
not
appreciate
as
much
as
we
did
one
set
of
inmates
of
the
cottage
the
flying
squirrels
we
loved
having
the
flying
squirrels
father
and
mother
and
young
in
their
nest
among
the
rafters
and
at
night
we
slept
so
soundly
that
we
did
not
in
the
least
mind
the
wild
gambols
of
the
little
fellows
through
the
rooms
even
when
as
sometimes
happened
they
would
swoop
down
to
the
bed
and
scuttle
across
it
one
april
i
went
to
yellowstone
park
when
the
snow
was
still
very
deep
and
i
took
john
burroughs
with
me
i
wished
to
show
him
the
big
game
of
the
park
the
wild
creatures
that
have
become
so
astonishingly
tame
and
tolerant
of
human
presence
in
the
yellowstone
the
animals
seem
always
to
behave
as
one
wishes
them
to
it
is
always
possible
to
see
the
sheep
and
deer
and
antelope
and
also
the
great
herds
of
elk
which
are
shyer
than
the
smaller
beasts
in
april
we
found
the
elk
weak
after
the
short
commons
and
hard
living
of
winter
once
without
much
difficulty
i
regularly
rounded
up
a
big
band
of
them
so
that
john
burroughs
could
look
at
them
i
do
not
think
however
that
he
cared
to
see
them
as
much
as
i
did
the
birds
interested
him
more
especially
a
tiny
owl
the
size
of
a
robin
which
we
saw
perched
on
the
top
of
a
tree
in
entirely
uninfluenced
by
the
sun
and
making
a
queer
noise
like
a
cork
being
pulled
from
a
bottle
i
was
rather
ashamed
to
find
how
much
better
his
eyes
were
than
mine
in
seeing
the
birds
and
grasping
their
differences
when
in
texas
and
when
in
louisiana
and
mississippi
i
was
not
only
enthralled
by
the
sport
but
also
by
the
strange
new
birds
and
other
creatures
and
the
trees
and
flowers
i
had
not
known
before
by
the
way
there
was
one
feast
at
the
white
house
which
stands
above
all
others
in
my
memory
even
above
the
time
when
i
lured
joel
chandler
harris
thither
for
a
night
a
deed
in
which
to
triumph
as
all
who
knew
that
inveterately
shy
recluse
will
testify
this
was
the
dinner
i
had
been
treated
so
kindly
by
my
friends
on
these
hunts
and
they
were
such
fine
fellows
men
whom
i
was
so
proud
to
think
of
as
americans
that
i
set
my
heart
on
having
them
at
a
hunters
dinner
at
the
white
house
one
december
i
succeeded
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
all
told
as
good
hunters
as
daring
riders
as
citizens
as
could
be
found
anywhere
no
finer
set
of
guests
ever
sat
at
meat
in
the
white
house
and
among
other
game
on
the
table
was
a
black
bear
itself
contributed
by
one
of
these
same
guests
when
i
first
visited
california
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
see
the
big
trees
the
sequoias
and
then
to
travel
down
into
the
yosemite
with
john
muir
of
course
of
all
people
in
the
world
he
was
the
one
with
whom
it
was
best
worth
while
thus
to
see
the
yosemite
he
told
me
that
when
emerson
came
to
california
he
tried
to
get
him
to
come
out
and
camp
with
him
for
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
to
see
at
their
best
the
majesty
and
charm
of
the
sierras
but
at
the
time
emerson
was
getting
old
and
could
not
go
john
muir
met
me
with
a
couple
of
packers
and
two
mules
to
carry
our
tent
bedding
and
food
for
a
three
days
trip
the
first
night
was
clear
and
we
lay
down
in
the
darkening
aisles
of
the
great
sequoia
grove
the
majestic
trunks
beautiful
in
color
and
in
symmetry
rose
round
us
like
the
pillars
of
a
mightier
cathedral
than
ever
was
conceived
even
by
the
fervor
of
the
middle
ages
hermit
thrushes
sang
beautifully
in
the
evening
and
again
with
a
burst
of
wonderful
music
at
dawn
i
was
interested
and
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
unlike
john
burroughs
john
muir
cared
little
for
birds
or
bird
songs
and
knew
little
about
them
the
meant
nothing
to
him
the
trees
and
the
flowers
and
the
cliffs
everything
the
only
birds
he
noticed
or
cared
for
were
some
that
were
very
conspicuous
such
as
the
always
particular
favorites
of
mine
too
the
second
night
we
camped
in
a
on
the
edge
of
the
canyon
walls
under
the
spreading
limbs
of
a
grove
of
mighty
silver
fir
and
next
day
we
went
down
into
the
wonderland
of
the
valley
itself
i
shall
always
be
glad
that
i
was
in
the
yosemite
with
john
muir
and
in
the
yellowstone
with
john
burroughs
like
most
americans
interested
in
birds
and
books
i
know
a
good
deal
about
english
birds
as
they
appear
in
books
i
know
the
lark
of
shakespeare
and
shelley
and
the
ettrick
shepherd
i
know
the
nightingale
of
milton
and
keats
i
know
wordsworth
cuckoo
i
know
mavis
and
merle
singing
in
the
merry
green
wood
of
the
old
ballads
i
know
jenny
wren
and
cock
robin
of
the
nursery
books
therefore
i
had
always
much
desired
to
hear
the
birds
in
real
life
and
the
opportunity
offered
in
june
when
i
spent
two
or
three
weeks
in
england
as
i
could
snatch
but
a
few
hours
from
a
very
exciting
round
of
pleasures
and
duties
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
with
some
companion
who
could
identify
both
song
and
singer
in
sir
edward
grey
a
keen
lover
of
outdoor
life
in
all
its
phases
and
a
delightful
companion
who
knows
the
songs
and
ways
of
english
birds
as
very
few
do
know
them
i
found
the
best
possible
guide
we
left
london
on
the
morning
of
june
hours
before
i
sailed
from
southampton
getting
off
the
train
at
basingstoke
we
drove
to
the
pretty
smiling
valley
of
the
itchen
here
we
tramped
for
three
or
four
hours
then
again
drove
this
time
to
the
edge
of
the
new
forest
where
we
first
took
tea
at
an
inn
and
then
tramped
through
the
forest
to
an
inn
on
its
other
side
at
brockenhurst
at
the
conclusion
of
our
walk
my
companion
made
a
list
of
the
birds
we
had
seen
putting
an
asterisk
opposite
those
which
we
had
heard
sing
there
were
of
the
former
and
of
the
latter
as
follows
thrush
blackbird
lark
yellowhammer
robin
wren
goldfinch
chaffinch
pied
wagtail
sparrow
dunnock
hedge
accentor
missel
thrush
starling
rook
jackdaw

grebe

pheasant
partridge
the
valley
of
the
itchen
is
typically
the
england
that
we
know
from
novel
and
story
and
essay
it
is
very
beautiful
in
every
way
with
a
rich
civilized
fertile
beauty
the
rapid
brook
twisting
among
its
reed
beds
the
rich
green
of
trees
and
grass
the
stately
woods
the
gardens
and
fields
the
exceedingly
picturesque
cottages
the
great
handsome
houses
standing
in
their
parks
birds
were
plentiful
i
know
but
few
places
in
america
where
one
would
see
such
an
abundance
of
individuals
and
i
was
struck
by
seeing
such
large
birds
as
coots
water
hens
grebes
tufted
ducks
pigeons
and
peewits
in
places
in
america
as
thickly
settled
as
the
valley
of
the
itchen
i
should
not
expect
to
see
any
like
number
of
birds
of
this
size
but
i
hope
that
the
efforts
of
the
audubon
societies
and
kindred
organizations
will
gradually
make
themselves
felt
until
it
becomes
a
point
of
honor
not
only
with
the
american
man
but
with
the
american
small
boy
to
shield
and
protect
all
forms
of
harmless
wild
life
true
sportsmen
should
take
the
lead
in
such
a
movement
for
if
there
is
to
be
any
shooting
there
must
be
something
to
shoot
the
prime
necessity
is
to
keep
and
not
kill
out
even
the
birds
which
in
legitimate
numbers
may
be
shot
the
new
forest
is
a
wild
uninhabited
stretch
of
heath
and
woodland
many
of
the
trees
gnarled
and
aged
and
its
very
wildness
the
lack
of
cultivation
the
ruggedness
made
it
strongly
attractive
in
my
eyes
and
suggested
my
own
country
the
birds
of
course
were
much
less
plentiful
than
beside
the
itchen
the
bird
that
most
impressed
me
on
my
walk
was
the
blackbird
i
had
already
heard
nightingales
in
abundance
near
lake
como
and
had
also
listened
to
larks
but
i
had
never
heard
either
the
blackbird
the
song
thrush
or
the
blackcap
warbler
and
while
i
knew
that
all
three
were
good
singers
i
did
not
know
what
really
beautiful
singers
they
were
blackbirds
were
very
abundant
and
they
played
a
prominent
part
in
the
chorus
which
we
heard
throughout
the
day
on
every
hand
though
perhaps
loudest
the
following
morning
at
dawn
in
its
habits
and
manners
the
blackbird
strikingly
resembles
our
american
robin
and
indeed
looks
exactly
like
a
robin
with
a
yellow
bill
and
plumage
it
hops
everywhere
over
the
lawns
just
as
our
robin
does
and
it
lives
and
nests
in
the
gardens
in
the
same
fashion
its
song
has
a
general
resemblance
to
that
of
our
robin
but
many
of
the
notes
are
far
more
musical
more
like
those
of
our
wood
thrush
indeed
there
were
individuals
among
those
we
heard
certain
of
whose
notes
seemed
to
me
almost
to
equal
in
point
of
melody
the
chimes
of
the
wood
thrush
and
the
highest
possible
praise
for
any
is
to
liken
its
song
to
that
of
the
wood
thrush
or
hermit
thrush
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
the
blackbird
has
received
full
justice
in
the
books
i
knew
that
he
was
a
singer
but
i
really
had
no
idea
how
fine
a
singer
he
was
i
suppose
one
of
his
troubles
has
been
his
name
just
as
with
our
own
catbird
when
he
appears
in
the
ballads
as
the
merle
bracketed
with
his
cousin
the
mavis
the
song
thrush
it
is
far
easier
to
recognize
him
as
the
master
singer
that
he
is
it
is
a
fine
thing
for
england
to
have
such
an
asset
of
the
countryside
a
bird
so
common
so
much
in
evidence
so
fearless
and
such
a
really
beautiful
singer
the
thrush
is
a
fine
singer
too
a
better
singer
than
our
american
robin
but
to
my
mind
not
at
the
best
quite
as
good
as
the
blackbird
at
his
best
although
often
i
found
difficulty
in
telling
the
song
of
one
from
the
song
of
the
other
especially
if
i
only
heard
two
or
three
notes
the
larks
were
of
course
exceedingly
attractive
it
was
fascinating
to
see
them
spring
from
the
grass
circle
upwards
steadily
singing
and
soaring
for
several
minutes
and
then
return
to
the
point
whence
they
had
started
as
my
companion
pointed
out
they
exactly
fulfilled
wordsworth
description
they
soared
but
did
not
roam
it
is
quite
impossible
wholly
to
differentiate
a
bird
voice
from
its
habits
and
surroundings
although
in
the
lark
song
there
are
occasional
musical
notes
the
song
as
a
whole
is
not
very
musical
but
it
is
so
joyous
buoyant
and
unbroken
and
uttered
under
such
conditions
as
fully
to
entitle
the
bird
to
the
place
he
occupies
with
both
poet
and
prose
writer
the
most
musical
singer
we
heard
was
the
blackcap
warbler
to
my
ear
its
song
seemed
more
musical
than
that
of
the
nightingale
it
was
astonishingly
powerful
for
so
small
a
bird
in
volume
and
continuity
it
does
not
come
up
to
the
songs
of
the
thrushes
and
of
certain
other
birds
but
in
quality
as
an
isolated
bit
of
melody
it
can
hardly
be
surpassed
among
the
minor
singers
the
robin
was
noticeable
we
all
know
this
pretty
little
bird
from
the
books
and
i
was
prepared
to
find
him
as
friendly
and
attractive
as
he
proved
to
be
but
i
had
not
realized
how
well
he
sang
it
is
not
a
loud
song
but
very
musical
and
attractive
and
the
bird
is
said
to
sing
practically
all
through
the
year
the
song
of
the
wren
interested
me
much
because
it
was
not
in
the
least
like
that
of
our
house
wren
but
on
the
contrary
like
that
of
our
winter
wren
the
theme
is
the
same
as
the
winter
wren
but
the
song
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
as
brilliantly
musical
as
that
of
the
tiny
singer
of
the
north
woods
the
sedge
warbler
sang
in
the
thick
reeds
a
mocking
ventriloquial
lay
which
reminded
me
at
times
of
the
less
pronounced
parts
of
our
chat
song
the
cuckoo
cry
was
singularly
attractive
and
musical
far
more
so
than
the
rolling
many
times
repeated
note
of
our
we
did
not
reach
the
inn
at
brockenhurst
until
about
nine
just
at
nightfall
and
a
few
minutes
before
that
we
heard
a
nightjar
it
did
not
sound
in
the
least
like
either
our
or
our
uttering
a
call
of
one
or
two
syllables
repeated
over
and
over
the
chaffinch
was
very
much
in
evidence
continually
chaunting
its
unimportant
little
ditty
i
was
pleased
to
see
the
bold
masterful
missel
thrush
the
stormcock
as
it
is
often
called
but
this
bird
breeds
and
sings
in
the
early
spring
when
the
weather
is
still
tempestuous
and
had
long
been
silent
when
we
saw
it
the
starlings
rooks
and
jackdaws
did
not
sing
and
their
calls
were
attractive
merely
as
the
calls
of
our
grackles
are
attractive
and
the
other
birds
that
we
heard
sing
though
they
played
their
part
in
the
general
chorus
were
performers
of
no
especial
note
like
our
pine
warblers
and
chipping
sparrows
the
great
spring
chorus
had
already
begun
to
subside
but
the
woods
and
fields
were
still
vocal
with
beautiful
bird
music
the
country
was
very
lovely
the
inn
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
the
bath
and
supper
very
enjoyable
after
our
tramp
and
altogether
i
passed
no
pleasanter
hours
during
my
entire
european
trip
ten
days
later
at
sagamore
hill
i
was
among
my
own
birds
and
was
much
interested
as
i
listened
to
and
looked
at
them
in
remembering
the
notes
and
actions
of
the
birds
i
had
seen
in
england
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
i
sat
in
my
on
the
broad
veranda
looking
across
the
sound
towards
the
glory
of
the
sunset
the
thickly
grassed
hillside
sloped
down
in
front
of
me
to
a
belt
of
forest
from
which
rose
the
golden
leisurely
chiming
of
the
wood
thrushes
chanting
their
vespers
through
the
still
air
came
the
warble
of
vireo
and
tanager
and
after
nightfall
we
heard
the
flight
song
of
an
ovenbird
from
the
same
belt
of
timber
overhead
an
oriole
sang
in
the
weeping
elm
now
and
then
breaking
his
song
to
scold
like
an
overgrown
wren
and
catbirds
sang
in
the
shrubbery
one
robin
had
built
its
nest
over
the
front
and
one
over
the
back
door
and
there
was
a
chippy
nest
in
the
wistaria
vine
by
the
stoop
during
the
next
hours
i
saw
and
heard
either
right
around
the
house
or
while
walking
down
to
bathe
through
the
woods
the
following
birds
little
green

thistlefinch

indigo

towhee
and
screech
owl
the
birds
were
still
in
full
song
for
on
long
island
there
is
little
abatement
in
the
chorus
until
about
the
second
week
of
july
when
the
blossoming
of
the
chestnut
trees
patches
the
woodland
with
frothy
alas
the
blight
has
now
destroyed
the
chestnut
trees
and
robbed
our
woods
of
one
of
their
distinctive
beauties
our
most
beautiful
singers
are
the
wood
thrushes
they
sing
not
only
in
the
early
morning
but
throughout
the
long
hot
june
afternoons
sometimes
they
sing
in
the
trees
immediately
around
the
house
and
if
the
air
is
still
we
can
always
hear
them
from
among
the
tall
trees
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
thrashers
sing
in
the
hedgerows
beyond
the
garden
the
catbirds
everywhere
the
catbirds
have
such
an
attractive
song
that
it
is
extremely
irritating
to
know
that
at
any
moment
they
may
interrupt
it
to
mew
and
squeal
the
bold
cheery
music
of
the
robins
always
seems
typical
of
the
bold
cheery
birds
themselves
the
baltimore
orioles
nest
in
the
young
elms
around
the
house
and
the
orchard
orioles
in
the
apple
trees
near
the
garden
and
outbuildings
among
the
earliest
sounds
of
spring
is
the
cheerful
simple
homely
song
of
the
and
in
march
we
also
hear
the
piercing
cadence
of
the
to
us
one
of
the
most
attractive
of
all
bird
calls
of
late
years
now
and
then
we
hear
the
rollicking
bubbling
melody
of
the
bobolink
in
the
pastures
back
of
the
barn
and
when
the
full
chorus
of
these
and
of
many
other
of
the
singers
of
spring
is
dying
down
there
are
some
true
songsters
such
as
the
brightly
hued
indigo
buntings
and
thistlefinches
among
the
finches
one
of
the
most
musical
and
plaintive
songs
is
that
of
the
i
do
not
know
why
the
books
call
it
for
it
does
not
dwell
in
the
open
fields
like
the
vesperfinch
the
and
but
among
the
cedars
and
bayberry
bushes
and
young
locusts
in
the
same
places
where
the
prairie
warbler
is
found
nor
is
it
only
the
true
songs
that
delight
us
we
love
to
hear
the
flickers
call
and
we
readily
pardon
any
one
of
their
number
which
as
occasionally
happens
is
bold
enough
to
wake
us
in
the
early
morning
by
drumming
on
the
shingles
of
the
roof
in
our
ears
the
blackbirds
have
a
very
attractive
note
we
love
the
screaming
of
the
hawks
as
they
soar
high
overhead
and
even
the
calls
of
the
night
heron
that
nest
in
the
tall
water
maples
by
one
of
the
wood
ponds
on
our
place
and
the
little
green
herons
that
nest
beside
the
salt
marsh
it
is
hard
to
tell
just
how
much
of
the
attraction
in
any
lies
in
the
music
itself
and
how
much
in
the
associations
this
is
what
makes
it
so
useless
to
try
to
compare
the
bird
songs
of
one
country
with
those
of
another
a
man
who
is
worth
anything
can
no
more
be
entirely
impartial
in
speaking
of
the
bird
songs
with
which
from
his
earliest
childhood
he
has
been
familiar
than
he
can
be
entirely
impartial
in
speaking
of
his
own
family
at
sagamore
hill
we
love
a
great
many
things
birds
and
trees
and
books
and
all
things
beautiful
and
horses
and
rifles
and
children
and
hard
work
and
the
joy
of
life
we
have
great
fireplaces
and
in
them
the
logs
roar
and
crackle
during
the
long
winter
evenings
the
big
piazza
is
for
the
hot
still
afternoons
of
summer
as
in
every
house
there
are
things
that
appeal
to
the
householder
because
of
their
associations
but
which
would
not
mean
much
to
others
naturally
any
man
who
has
been
president
and
filled
other
positions
accumulates
such
things
with
scant
regard
to
his
own
personal
merits
perhaps
our
most
cherished
possessions
are
a
remington
bronze
the
bronco
buster
given
me
by
my
men
when
the
regiment
was
mustered
out
and
a
big
tiffany
silver
vase
given
to
roosevelt
by
the
enlisted
men
of
the
battleship
louisiana
after
we
returned
from
a
cruise
on
her
to
panama
it
was
a
real
surprise
gift
presented
to
her
in
the
white
house
on
behalf
of
the
whole
crew
by
four
as
strapping
as
ever
swung
a
turret
or
pointed
a
gun
the
enlisted
men
of
the
army
i
already
knew
well
of
course
i
knew
well
the
officers
of
both
army
and
navy
but
the
enlisted
men
of
the
navy
i
only
grew
to
know
well
when
i
was
president
on
the
louisiana
roosevelt
and
i
once
dined
at
the
chief
petty
mess
and
on
another
battleship
the
missouri
when
i
was
in
company
with
admiral
evans
and
captain
cowles
and
again
on
the
sylph
and
on
the
mayflower
we
also
dined
as
guests
of
the
crew
when
we
finished
our
trip
on
the
louisiana
i
made
a
short
speech
to
the
assembled
crew
and
at
its
close
one
of
the
petty
officers
the
very
picture
of
what
a
should
look
like
proposed
three
cheers
for
me
in
terms
that
struck
me
as
curiously
illustrative
of
america
at
her
best
he
said
now
then
men
three
cheers
for
theodore
roosevelt
the
typical
american
citizen
that
was
the
way
in
which
they
thought
of
the
american
president
and
a
very
good
way
too
it
was
an
expression
that
would
have
come
naturally
only
to
men
in
whom
the
american
principles
of
government
and
life
were
ingrained
just
as
they
were
ingrained
in
the
men
of
my
regiment
i
need
scarcely
add
but
i
will
add
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
do
not
know
that
this
attitude
of
identification
of
interest
and
purpose
is
not
only
compatible
with
but
can
only
exist
when
there
is
fine
and
real
discipline
as
thorough
and
genuine
as
the
discipline
that
has
always
obtained
in
the
most
formidable
fighting
fleets
and
armies
the
discipline
and
the
mutual
respect
are
complementary
not
antagonistic
during
the
presidency
all
of
us
but
especially
the
children
became
close
friends
with
many
of
the
sailor
men
the
four
bearers
of
the
vase
to
roosevelt
were
promptly
hailed
as
delightful
big
brothers
by
our
two
smallest
boys
who
at
once
took
them
to
see
the
sights
of
washington
in
the
landau
the
president
as
with
seafaring
humor
our
guests
immediately
styled
it
once
after
we
were
in
private
life
again
roosevelt
was
in
a
railway
station
and
had
some
difficulty
with
her
ticket
a
quiet
man
stepped
up
and
asked
if
he
could
be
of
help
he
remarked
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
mayflower
crew
and
knew
us
well
and
in
answer
to
a
question
explained
that
he
had
left
the
navy
in
order
to
study
dentistry
and
added
a
delicious
touch
that
while
thus
preparing
himself
to
be
a
dentist
he
was
earning
the
necessary
money
to
go
on
with
his
studies
by
practicing
the
profession
of
a
being

a

the

of
a
uganda
king
the
gold
box
in
which
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
london
was
given
me
a
beautiful
head
of
abraham
lincoln
given
me
by
the
french
authorities
after
my
speech
at
the
sorbonne
and
many
other
things
from
sources
as
diverse
as
the
sultan
of
turkey
and
the
dowager
empress
of
china
then
there
are
things
from
home
friends
a
polar
bear
skin
from
peary
a
sioux
buffalo
robe
with
on
it
painted
by
some
sioux
artist
the
picture
story
of
custer

a
bronze
portrait
plaque
of

the

used
in
sealing
the
treaty
of
portsmouth
sent
me
by
captain
cameron
winslow
a
shoe
worn
by
dan
patch
when
he
paced
a
mile
in
sent
me
by
his
owner
there
is
a
picture
of
a
bull
moose
by
carl
rungius
which
seems
to
me
as
spirited
an
animal
painting
as
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
north
room
with
its
tables
and
mantelpiece
and
desks
and
chests
made
of
woods
sent
from
the
philippines
by
army
friends
or
by
other
friends
for
other
reasons
with
its
bison
and
wapiti
heads
there
are
three
paintings
by
marcus
symonds
where
light
and
shadow
meet
the
porcelain
towers
and
the
seats
of
the
mighty
he
is
dead
now
and
he
had
scant
recognition
while
he
lived
yet
surely
he
was
a
great
imaginative
artist
a
wonderful
colorist
and
a
man
with
a
vision
more
wonderful
still
there
is
one
of
lungren
pictures
of
the
western
plains
and
a
picture
of
the
grand
canyon
and
one
by
a
scandinavian
artist
who
could
see
the
fierce
picturesqueness
of
workaday
pittsburgh
and
sketches
of
the
white
house
by
sargent
and
by
hopkinson
smith
the
books
are
everywhere
there
are
as
many
in
the
north
room
and
in
the
parlor
is
a
more
appropriate
name
than
parlor
as
in
the
library
the
at
the
top
of
the
house
which
incidentally
has
the
loveliest
view
of
all
contains
more
books
than
any
of
the
other
rooms
and
they
are
particularly
delightful
books
to
browse
among
just
because
they
have
not
much
relevance
to
one
another
this
being
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
are
relegated
to
their
present
abode
but
the
books
have
overflowed
into
all
the
other
rooms
too
i
could
not
name
any
principle
upon
which
the
books
have
been
gathered
books
are
almost
as
individual
as
friends
there
is
no
earthly
use
in
laying
down
general
laws
about
them
some
meet
the
needs
of
one
person
and
some
of
another
and
each
person
should
beware
of
the
besetting
sin
of
what
edgar
allan
poe
calls
the
mad
pride
of
intellectuality
taking
the
shape
of
arrogant
pity
for
the
man
who
does
not
like
the
same
kind
of
books
of
course
there
are
books
which
a
man
or
woman
uses
as
instruments
of
a
profession
law
books
medical
books
cookery
books
and
the
like
i
am
not
speaking
of
these
for
they
are
not
properly
books
at
all
they
come
in
the
category
of
telephone
directories
and
other
useful
agencies
of
civilized
life
i
am
speaking
of
books
that
are
meant
to
be
read
personally
granted
that
these
books
are
decent
and
healthy
the
one
test
to
which
i
demand
that
they
all
submit
is
that
of
being
interesting
if
the
book
is
not
interesting
to
the
reader
then
in
all
but
an
infinitesimal
number
of
cases
it
gives
scant
benefit
to
the
reader
of
course
any
reader
ought
to
cultivate
his
or
her
taste
so
that
good
books
will
appeal
to
it
and
that
trash
wo
but
after
this
point
has
once
been
reached
the
needs
of
each
reader
must
be
met
in
a
fashion
that
will
appeal
to
those
needs
personally
the
books
by
which
i
have
profited
infinitely
more
than
by
any
others
have
been
those
in
which
profit
was
a
of
the
pleasure
that
is
i
read
them
because
i
enjoyed
them
because
i
liked
reading
them
and
the
profit
came
in
as
part
of
the
enjoyment
of
course
each
individual
is
apt
to
have
some
special
tastes
in
which
he
can
not
expect
that
any
but
a
few
friends
will
share
now
i
am
very
proud
of
my
library
i
suppose
there
must
be
many
libraries
in
continental
europe
and
possibly
in
england
more
extensive
than
mine
but
i
have
not
happened
to
come
across
any
such
library
in
this
country
some
of
the
originals
go
back
to
the
sixteenth
century
and
there
are
copies
or
reproductions
of
the
two
or
three
most
famous
hunting
books
of
the
middle
ages
such
as
the
duke
of
york
translation
of
gaston
phoebus
and
the
queer
book
of
the
emperor
maximilian
it
is
only
very
occasionally
that
i
meet
any
one
who
cares
for
any
of
these
books
on
the
other
hand
i
expect
to
find
many
friends
who
will
turn
naturally
to
some
of
the
old
or
the
new
books
of
poetry
or
romance
or
history
to
which
we
of
the
household
habitually
turn
let
me
add
that
ours
is
in
no
sense
a
collector
library
each
book
was
procured
because
some
one
of
the
family
wished
to
read
it
we
could
never
afford
to
take
overmuch
thought
for
the
outsides
of
books
we
were
too
much
interested
in
their
insides
now
and
then
i
am
asked
as
to
what
books
a
statesman
should
read
and
my
answer
is
poetry
and
novels
including
short
stories
under
the
head
of
novels
i
do
mean
that
he
should
read
only
novels
and
modern
poetry
if
he
can
not
also
enjoy
the
hebrew
prophets
and
the
greek
dramatists
he
should
be
sorry
he
ought
to
read
interesting
books
on
history
and
government
and
books
of
science
and
philosophy
and
really
good
books
on
these
subjects
are
as
enthralling
as
any
fiction
ever
written
in
prose
or
verse
gibbon
and
macaulay
herodotus
thucydides
and
tacitus
the
heimskringla
froissart
joinville
and
villehardouin
parkman
and
mahan
mommsen
and
ranke
why
there
are
scores
and
scores
of
solid
histories
the
best
in
the
world
which
are
as
absorbing
as
the
best
of
all
the
novels
and
of
as
permanent
value
the
same
thing
is
true
of
darwin
and
huxley
and
carlyle
and
emerson
and
parts
of
kant
and
of
volumes
like
sutherland
growth
of
the
moral
instinct
or
acton
essays
and
lounsbury
studies
here
again
i
am
not
trying
to
class
books
together
or
measure
one
by
another
or
enumerate
one
in
a
thousand
of
those
worth
reading
but
just
to
indicate
that
any
man
or
woman
of
some
intelligence
and
some
cultivation
can
in
some
line
or
other
of
serious
thought
scientific
or
historical
or
philosophical
or
economic
or
governmental
find
any
number
of
books
which
are
charming
to
read
and
which
in
addition
give
that
for
which
his
or
her
soul
hungers
i
do
not
for
a
minute
mean
that
the
statesman
ought
not
to
read
a
great
many
different
books
of
this
character
just
as
every
one
else
should
read
them
but
in
the
final
event
the
statesman
and
the
publicist
and
the
reformer
and
the
agitator
for
new
things
and
the
upholder
of
what
is
good
in
old
things
all
need
more
than
anything
else
to
know
human
nature
to
know
the
needs
of
the
human
soul
and
they
will
find
this
nature
and
these
needs
set
forth
as
nowhere
else
by
the
great
imaginative
writers
whether
of
prose
or
of
poetry
the
room
for
choice
is
so
limitless
that
to
my
mind
it
seems
absurd
to
try
to
make
catalogues
which
shall
be
supposed
to
appeal
to
all
the
best
thinkers
this
is
why
i
have
no
sympathy
whatever
with
writing
lists
of
the
one
hundred
best
books
or
the
library
it
is
all
right
for
a
man
to
amuse
himself
by
composing
a
list
of
a
hundred
very
good
books
and
if
he
is
to
go
off
for
a
year
or
so
where
he
can
not
get
many
books
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
choose
a
library
of
particular
books
which
in
that
particular
year
and
on
that
particular
trip
he
would
like
to
read
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
hundred
books
that
are
best
for
all
men
or
for
the
majority
of
men
or
for
one
man
at
all
times
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
library
which
will
satisfy
the
needs
of
even
one
particular
man
on
different
occasions
extending
over
a
number
of
years
milton
is
best
for
one
mood
and
pope
for
another
because
a
man
likes
whitman
or
browning
or
lowell
he
should
not
feel
himself
debarred
from
tennyson
or
kipling
or
korner
or
heine
or
the
bard
of
the
dimbovitza
tolstoy
novels
are
good
at
one
time
and
those
of
sienkiewicz
at
another
and
he
is
fortunate
who
can
relish
salammbo
and
tom
brown
and
the
two
admirals
and
quentin
durward
and
artemus
ward
and
the
ingoldsby
legends
and
pickwick
and
vanity
fair
why
there
are
hundreds
of
books
like
these
each
one
of
which
if
really
read
really
assimilated
by
the
person
to
whom
it
happens
to
appeal
will
enable
that
person
quite
unconsciously
to
furnish
himself
with
much
ammunition
which
he
will
find
of
use
in
the
battle
of
life
a
book
must
be
interesting
to
the
particular
reader
at
that
particular
time
but
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
interesting
books
and
some
of
them
are
sealed
to
some
men
and
some
are
sealed
to
others
and
some
stir
the
soul
at
some
given
point
of
a
man
life
and
yet
convey
no
message
at
other
times
the
reader
the
booklover
must
meet
his
own
needs
without
paying
too
much
attention
to
what
his
neighbors
say
those
needs
should
be
he
must
not
hypocritically
pretend
to
like
what
he
does
not
like
yet
at
the
same
time
he
must
avoid
that
most
unpleasant
of
all
the
indications
of
vanity
which
consists
in
treating
mere
individual
and
perhaps
unfortunate
idiosyncrasy
as
a
matter
of
pride
i
happen
to
be
devoted
to
macbeth
whereas
i
very
seldom
read
hamlet
though
i
like
parts
of
it
now
i
am
humbly
and
sincerely
conscious
that
this
is
a
demerit
in
me
and
not
in
hamlet
and
yet
it
would
not
do
me
any
good
to
pretend
that
i
like
hamlet
as
much
as
macbeth
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
i
am
very
fond
of
simple
epics
and
of
ballad
poetry
from
the
nibelungenlied
and
the
roland
song
through
chevy
chase
and
patrick
spens
and
twa
corbies
to
scott
poems
and
longfellow
saga
of
king
olaf
and
othere
on
the
other
hand
i
do
care
to
read
dramas
as
a
rule
i
can
not
read
them
with
enjoyment
unless
they
appeal
to
me
very
strongly
they
must
almost
be
aeschylus
or
euripides
goethe
or
moliere
in
order
that
i
may
not
feel
after
finishing
them
a
sense
of
virtuous
pride
in
having
achieved
a
task
now
i
would
be
the
first
to
deny
that
even
the
most
delightful
old
english
ballad
should
be
put
on
a
par
with
any
one
of
scores
of
dramatic
works
by
authors
whom
i
have
not
mentioned
i
know
that
each
of
these
dramatists
has
written
what
is
of
more
worth
than
the
ballad
only
i
enjoy
the
ballad
and
i
do
enjoy
the
drama
and
therefore
the
ballad
is
better
for
me
and
this
fact
is
not
altered
by
the
other
fact
that
my
own
shortcomings
are
to
blame
in
the
matter
i
still
read
a
number
of
scott
novels
over
and
over
again
whereas
if
i
finish
anything
by
miss
austen
i
have
a
feeling
that
duty
performed
is
a
rainbow
to
the
soul
but
other
booklovers
who
are
very
close
kin
to
me
and
whose
taste
i
know
to
be
better
than
mine
read
miss
austen
all
the
time
and
moreover
they
are
very
kind
and
never
pity
me
in
too
offensive
a
manner
for
not
reading
her
myself
aside
from
the
masters
of
literature
there
are
all
kinds
of
books
which
one
person
will
find
delightful
and
which
he
certainly
ought
not
to
surrender
just
because
nobody
else
is
able
to
find
as
much
in
the
beloved
volume
there
is
on
our
a
little
novel
or
tale
called
the
couple
it
is
told
with
much
humor
it
is
a
story
of
gentlefolk
who
are
really
gentlefolk
and
to
me
it
is
altogether
delightful
but
outside
the
members
of
my
own
family
i
have
never
met
a
human
being
who
had
even
heard
of
it
and
i
suppose
i
ever
shall
meet
one
i
often
enjoy
a
story
by
some
living
author
so
much
that
i
write
to
tell
him
so
or
to
tell
her
so
and
at
least
half
the
time
i
regret
my
action
because
it
encourages
the
writer
to
believe
that
the
public
shares
my
views
and
he
then
finds
that
the
public
does
books
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
and
we
love
them
at
sagamore
hill
but
children
are
better
than
books
sagamore
hill
is
one
of
three
neighboring
houses
in
which
small
cousins
spent
very
happy
years
of
childhood
in
the
three
houses
there
were
at
one
time
sixteen
of
these
small
cousins
all
told
and
once
we
ranged
them
in
order
of
size
and
took
their
photograph
there
are
many
kinds
of
success
in
life
worth
having
it
is
exceedingly
interesting
and
attractive
to
be
a
successful
business
man
or
railroad
man
or
farmer
or
a
successful
lawyer
or
doctor
or
a
writer
or
a
president
or
a
ranchman
or
the
colonel
of
a
fighting
regiment
or
to
kill
grizzly
bears
and
lions
but
for
unflagging
interest
and
enjoyment
a
household
of
children
if
things
go
reasonably
well
certainly
makes
all
other
forms
of
success
and
achievement
lose
their
importance
by
comparison
it
may
be
true
that
he
travels
farthest
who
travels
alone
but
the
goal
thus
reached
is
not
worth
reaching
and
as
for
a
life
deliberately
devoted
to
pleasure
as
an
end
why
the
greatest
happiness
is
the
happiness
that
comes
as
a
of
striving
to
do
what
must
be
done
even
though
sorrow
is
met
in
the
doing
there
is
a
bit
of
homely
philosophy
quoted
by
squire
bill
widener
of
widener
valley
virginia
which
sums
up
one
duty
in
life
do
what
you
can
with
what
you
got
where
you
are
the
country
is
the
place
for
children
and
if
not
the
country
a
city
small
enough
so
that
one
can
get
out
into
the
country
when
our
own
children
were
little
we
were
for
several
winters
in
washington
and
each
sunday
afternoon
the
whole
family
spent
in
rock
creek
park
which
was
then
very
real
country
indeed
i
would
drag
one
of
the
wagons
and
when
the
very
smallest
pairs
of
feet
grew
tired
of
trudging
bravely
after
us
or
of
racing
on
rapturous
side
trips
after
flowers
and
other
treasures
the
owners
would
clamber
into
the
wagon
one
of
these
wagons
by
the
way
a
gorgeous
red
one
had
express
painted
on
it
in
gilt
letters
and
was
known
to
the
younger
children
as
the
wagon
they
evidently
associated
the
color
with
the
term
once
while
we
were
at
sagamore
something
happened
to
the
cherished
wagon
to
the
distress
of
the
children
and
especially
of
the
child
who
owned
it
their
mother
and
i
were
just
starting
for
a
drive
in
the
buggy
and
we
promised
the
bereaved
owner
that
we
would
visit
a
store
we
knew
in
east
norwich
a
village
a
few
miles
away
and
bring
back
another
wagon
when
we
reached
the
store
we
found
to
our
dismay
that
the
wagon
which
we
had
seen
had
been
sold
we
could
not
bear
to
return
without
the
promised
gift
for
we
knew
that
the
brains
of
small
persons
are
much
puzzled
when
their
elders
seem
to
break
promises
fortunately
we
saw
in
the
store
a
delightful
little
chair
and
table
and
these
we
brought
home
and
handed
solemnly
over
to
the
expectant
recipient
explaining
that
as
there
unfortunately
was
not
a
wagon
we
had
brought
him
back
a
chair
and
table
it
worked
beautifully
the
chair
and
table
were
received
with
such
rapture
that
we
had
to
get
duplicates
for
the
other
small
member
of
the
family
who
was
the
particular
crony
of
the
proprietor
of
the
new
treasures
when
their
mother
and
i
returned
from
a
row
we
would
often
see
the
children
waiting
for
us
running
like
along
the
beach
they
always
liked
to
swim
in
company
with
a
of
buoyant
temperament
and
inventive
mind
and
the
float
offered
limitless
opportunities
for
enjoyment
while
bathing
all
dutiful
parents
know
the
game
of
each
child
is
given
a
name
such
as
the
whip
the
nigh
leader
the
off
wheeler
the
old
lady
passenger
and
under
penalty
of
paying
a
forfeit
must
get
up
and
turn
round
when
the
who
is
improvising
a
thrilling
story
mentions
that
particular
object
and
when
the
word
is
mentioned
everybody
has
to
get
up
and
turn
round
well
we
used
to
play
on
the
float
while
in
swimming
and
instead
of
tamely
getting
up
and
turning
round
the
child
whose
turn
it
was
had
to
plunge
overboard
when
i
mentioned
the
water
fairly
foamed
with
vigorously
kicking
little
legs
and
then
there
was
always
a
moment
of
interest
while
i
counted
so
as
to
be
sure
that
the
number
of
heads
that
came
up
corresponded
with
the
number
of
children
who
had
gone
down
no
man
or
woman
will
ever
forget
the
time
when
some
child
lies
sick
of
a
disease
that
threatens
its
life
moreover
much
less
serious
sickness
is
unpleasant
enough
at
the
time
looking
back
however
there
are
elements
of
comedy
in
certain
of
the
less
serious
cases
i
well
remember
one
such
instance
which
occurred
when
we
were
living
in
washington
in
a
small
house
with
barely
enough
room
for
everybody
when
all
the
chinks
were
filled
measles
descended
on
the
household
in
the
effort
to
keep
the
children
that
were
well
and
those
that
were
sick
apart
their
mother
and
i
had
to
camp
out
in
improvised
fashion
when
the
eldest
small
boy
was
getting
well
and
had
recovered
his
spirits
i
slept
on
a
sofa
beside
his
bed
the
sofa
being
so
short
that
my
feet
projected
over
anyhow
one
afternoon
the
small
boy
was
given
a
toy
organ
by
a
sympathetic
friend
next
morning
early
i
was
waked
to
find
the
small
boy
very
vivacious
and
requesting
a
story
having
drowsily
told
the
story
i
said
now
father
told
you
a
story
so
you
amuse
yourself
and
let
father
go
to
sleep
to
which
the
small
boy
responded
most
virtuously
yes
father
will
go
to
sleep
and
i
play
the
organ
which
he
did
at
a
distance
of
two
feet
from
my
head
later
his
sister
who
had
just
come
down
with
the
measles
was
put
into
the
same
room
the
small
boy
was
convalescing
and
was
engaged
in
playing
on
the
floor
with
some
tin
ships
together
with
two
or
three
pasteboard
monitors
and
rams
of
my
own
manufacture
he
was
giving
a
vivid
rendering
of
farragut
at
mobile
bay
from
memories
of
how
i
had
told
the
story
my
pasteboard
rams
and
monitors
were
fascinating
if
a
naval
architect
may
be
allowed
to
praise
his
own
work
and
as
property
they
were
equally
divided
between
the
little
girl
and
the
small
boy
the
little
girl
looked
on
with
alert
suspicion
from
the
bed
for
she
was
not
yet
convalescent
enough
to
be
allowed
down
on
the
floor
the
small
boy
was
busily
reciting
the
phases
of
the
fight
which
now
approached
its
climax
and
the
little
girl
evidently
suspected
that
her
monitor
was
destined
to
play
the
part
of
victim
little
boy
and
then
they
steamed
bang
into
the
monitor
little
girl
brother
do
you
sink
my
monitor
little
boy
without
heeding
and
hurrying
toward
the
climax
and
the
torpedo
went
at
the
monitor
little
girl
my
monitor
is
not
to
sink
little
boy
dramatically
and
bang
the
monitor
sank
little
girl
it
did
do
any
such
thing
my
monitor
always
goes
to
bed
at
seven
and
it
now
quarter
past
my
monitor
was
in
bed
and
sink
when
i
was
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
leonard
wood
and
i
used
often
to
combine
forces
and
take
both
families
of
children
out
to
walk
and
occasionally
some
of
their
playmates
leonard
wood
son
i
found
attributed
the
paternity
of
all
of
those
not
of
his
own
family
to
me
once
we
were
taking
the
children
across
rock
creek
on
a
fallen
tree
i
was
standing
on
the
middle
of
the
log
trying
to
prevent
any
of
the
children
from
falling
off
and
while
making
a
clutch
at
one
peculiarly
active
and
heedless
child
i
fell
off
myself
as
i
emerged
from
the
water
i
heard
the
little
wood
boy
calling
frantically
to
the
general
oh
oh
the
father
of
all
the
children
fell
into
the
creek
which
made
me
feel
like
an
uncommonly
moist
patriarch
of
course
the
children
took
much
interest
in
the
trophies
i
occasionally
brought
back
from
my
hunts
when
i
started
for
my
regiment
in
the
stress
of
leaving
home
which
was
naturally
not
pleasant
was
somewhat
lightened
by
the
next
to
the
youngest
boy
whose
ideas
of
what
was
about
to
happen
were
hazy
clasping
me
round
the
legs
with
a
beaming
smile
and
saying
and
is
my
father
going
to
the
war
and
will
he
bring
me
back
a
bear
when
some
five
months
later
i
returned
of
course
in
my
uniform
this
little
boy
was
much
puzzled
as
to
my
identity
although
he
greeted
me
affably
with
good
afternoon
colonel
half
an
hour
later
somebody
asked
him
where
father
to
which
he
responded
i
do
know
but
the
colonel
is
taking
a
bath
of
course
the
children
anthropomorphized
if
that
is
the
proper
term
their
friends
of
the
animal
world
among
these
friends
at
one
period
was
the
baker
horse
and
on
a
very
rainy
day
i
heard
the
little
girl
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
say
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
oh
there
poor
kraft
horse
all
soppin
wet
while
i
was
in
the
white
house
the
youngest
boy
became
an
of
a
small
and
rather
noisome
animal
shop
and
the
owner
would
occasionally
let
him
take
pets
home
to
play
with
on
one
occasion
i
was
holding
a
conversation
with
one
of
the
leaders
in
congress
uncle
pete
hepburn
about
the
railroad
rate
bill
the
children
were
strictly
trained
not
to
interrupt
business
but
on
this
particular
occasion
the
little
boy
feelings
overcame
him
he
had
been
loaned
a
which
as
all
know
is
not
only
a
useful
but
a
beautiful
snake
very
friendly
to
human
beings
and
he
came
rushing
home
to
show
the
treasure
he
was
holding
it
inside
his
coat
and
it
contrived
to
wiggle
partly
down
the
sleeve
uncle
pete
hepburn
naturally
did
not
understand
the
full
import
of
what
the
little
boy
was
saying
to
me
as
he
endeavored
to
wriggle
out
of
his
jacket
and
kindly
started
to
help
him
and
then
jumped
back
with
alacrity
as
the
small
boy
and
the
snake
both
popped
out
of
the
jacket
there
could
be
no
healthier
and
pleasanter
place
in
which
to
bring
up
children
than
in
that
nook
of
america
around
sagamore
hill
certainly
i
never
knew
small
people
to
have
a
better
time
or
a
better
training
for
their
work
in
after
life
than
the
three
families
of
cousins
at
sagamore
hill
it
was
real
country
and
speaking
from
the
somewhat
detached
point
of
view
of
the
masculine
parent
i
should
say
there
was
just
the
proper
mixture
of
freedom
and
control
in
the
management
of
the
children
they
were
never
allowed
to
be
disobedient
or
to
shirk
lessons
or
work
and
they
were
encouraged
to
have
all
the
fun
possible
they
often
went
barefoot
especially
during
the
many
hours
passed
in
various
enthralling
pursuits
along
and
in
the
waters
of
the
bay
they
swam
they
tramped
they
boated
they
coasted
and
skated
in
winter
they
were
intimate
friends
with
the
cows
chickens
pigs
and
other
live
stock
they
had
in
succession
two
ponies
general
grant
and
when
the
legs
became
such
that
he
lay
down
too
often
and
too
unexpectedly
in
the
road
a
calico
pony
named
algonquin
who
is
still
living
a
life
of
honorable
leisure
in
the
stable
and
in
the
pasture
where
he
has
to
be
picketed
because
otherwise
he
chases
the
cows
sedate
pony
grant
used
to
draw
the
cart
in
which
the
children
went
driving
when
they
were
very
small
the
driver
being
their
old
nurse
mame
who
had
held
their
mother
in
her
arms
when
she
was
born
and
who
was
knit
to
them
by
a
tie
as
close
as
any
tie
of
blood
i
doubt
whether
i
ever
saw
mame
really
offended
with
them
except
once
when
out
of
pure
but
misunderstood
affection
they
named
a
pig
after
her
they
loved
pony
grant
once
i
saw
the
then
little
boy
of
three
hugging
pony
grant
fore
legs
as
he
leaned
over
his
broad
straw
hat
tilted
on
end
and
pony
grant
meditatively
munched
the
brim
whereupon
the
small
boy
looked
up
with
a
wail
of
anguish
evidently
thinking
the
pony
had
decided
to
treat
him
like
a
radish
the
children
had
pets
of
their
own
too
of
course
among
them
guinea
pigs
were
the
their
highly
unemotional
nature
fits
them
for
companionship
with
adoring
but
young
masters
and
mistresses
then
there
were
flying
squirrels
and
kangaroo
rats
gentle
and
trustful
and
a
badger
whose
temper
was
short
but
whose
nature
was
fundamentally
friendly
the
badger
name
was
josiah
the
particular
little
boy
whose
property
he
was
used
to
carry
him
about
clasped
firmly
around
what
would
have
been
his
waist
if
he
had
had
any
inasmuch
as
when
on
the
ground
the
badger
would
play
energetic
games
of
tag
with
the
little
boy
and
nip
his
bare
legs
i
suggested
that
it
would
be
uncommonly
disagreeable
if
he
took
advantage
of
being
held
in
the
little
boy
arms
to
bite
his
face
but
this
suggestion
was
repelled
with
scorn
as
an
unworthy
assault
on
the
character
of
josiah
he
bites
legs
sometimes
but
he
never
bites
faces
said
the
little
boy
we
also
had
a
young
black
bear
whom
the
children
christened
jonathan
edwards
partly
out
of
compliment
to
their
mother
who
was
descended
from
that
great
puritan
divine
and
partly
because
the
bear
possessed
a
temper
in
which
gloom
and
strength
were
combined
in
what
the
children
regarded
as
calvinistic
proportions
as
for
the
dogs
of
course
there
were
many
and
during
their
lives
they
were
intimate
and
valued
family
friends
and
their
deaths
were
household
tragedies
one
of
them
a
large
yellow
animal
of
several
good
breeds
and
valuable
rather
because
of
psychical
than
physical
traits
was
named
susan
by
his
small
owners
in
commemoration
of
another
retainer
a
white
cow
the
fact
that
the
cow
and
the
dog
were
not
of
the
same
sex
being
treated
with
indifference
much
the
most
individual
of
the
dogs
and
the
one
with
the
strongest
character
was
sailor
boy
a
chesapeake
bay
dog
he
had
a
masterful
temper
and
a
strong
sense
of
both
dignity
and
duty
he
would
never
let
the
other
dogs
fight
and
he
himself
never
fought
unless
circumstances
imperatively
demanded
it
but
he
was
a
murderous
animal
when
he
did
fight
he
was
not
only
exceedingly
fond
of
the
water
as
was
to
be
expected
but
passionately
devoted
to
gunpowder
in
every
form
for
he
loved
firearms
and
fairly
reveled
in
the
fourth
of
july
celebrations
the
latter
being
rather
hazardous
occasions
as
the
children
strongly
objected
to
any
safe
and
sane
element
being
injected
into
them
and
had
the
normal
number
of
close
shaves
with
rockets
roman
candles
and
firecrackers
one
of
the
for
enjoyment
especially
in
rainy
weather
was
the
old
barn
this
had
been
built
nearly
a
century
previously
and
was
as
delightful
as
only
the
pleasantest
kind
of
old
barn
can
be
it
stood
at
the
of
three
fences
a
favorite
amusement
used
to
be
an
obstacle
race
when
the
barn
was
full
of
hay
the
contestants
were
timed
and
were
started
successively
from
outside
the
door
they
rushed
inside
clambered
over
or
burrowed
through
the
hay
as
suited
them
best
dropped
out
of
a
place
where
a
loose
board
had
come
off
got
over
through
or
under
the
three
fences
and
raced
back
to
the
when
they
were
little
their
respective
fathers
were
expected
also
to
take
part
in
the
obstacle
race
and
when
with
the
advance
of
years
the
fathers
finally
refused
to
be
contestants
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
pained
regret
among
the
children
at
such
a
decline
in
the
sporting
spirit
another
famous
place
for
handicap
races
was
cooper
bluff
a
gigantic
rising
from
the
edge
of
the
bay
a
mile
from
the
house
if
the
tide
was
high
there
was
an
added
thrill
for
some
of
the
contestants
were
sure
to
run
into
the
water
as
soon
as
the
little
boys
learned
to
swim
they
were
allowed
to
go
off
by
themselves
in
rowboats
and
camp
out
for
the
night
along
the
sound
sometimes
i
would
go
along
so
as
to
take
the
smaller
children
once
a
schooner
was
wrecked
on
a
point
half
a
dozen
miles
away
she
held
together
well
for
a
season
or
two
after
having
been
cleared
of
everything
down
to
the
timbers
and
this
gave
us
the
chance
to
make
trips
in
which
the
girls
could
also
be
included
for
we
put
them
to
sleep
in
the
wreck
while
the
boys
slept
on
the
shore
squaw
picnics
the
children
called
them
my
children
when
young
went
to
the
public
school
near
us
the
little
cove
school
as
it
is
called
for
nearly
thirty
years
we
have
given
the
christmas
tree
to
the
school
before
the
gifts
are
distributed
i
am
expected
to
make
an
address
which
is
always
mercifully
short
my
own
children
having
impressed
upon
me
with
frank
sincerity
the
attitude
of
other
children
to
addresses
of
this
kind
on
such
occasions
there
are
of
course
performances
by
the
children
themselves
while
all
of
us
parents
look
admiringly
on
each
sympathizing
with
his
or
her
particular
offspring
in
the
somewhat
wooden
recital
of
darius
green
and
his
flying
machine
or
the
mountain
and
the
squirrel
had
a
quarrel
but
the
tree
and
the
gifts
make
up
for
all
shortcomings
we
had
a
sleigh
for
winter
but
if
when
there
was
much
snow
the
whole
family
desired
to
go
somewhere
we
would
put
the
body
of
the
farm
wagon
on
runners
and
all
bundle
in
together
we
always
liked
snow
at
christmas
time
and
the
down
to
the
church
on
christmas
eve
one
of
the
hymns
always
sung
at
this
christmas
eve
festival
begins
christmas
eve
on
the
river
it
christmas
eve
on
the
bay
all
good
natives
of
the
village
firmly
believe
that
this
hymn
was
written
here
and
with
direct
reference
to
oyster
bay
although
if
such
were
the
case
the
word
river
would
have
to
be
taken
in
a
hyperbolic
sense
as
the
nearest
approach
to
a
river
is
the
village
pond
i
used
to
share
this
belief
myself
until
my
faith
was
shaken
by
a
denver
lady
who
wrote
that
she
had
sung
that
hymn
when
a
child
in
michigan
and
that
at
the
present
time
her
little
denver
babies
also
loved
it
although
in
their
case
the
river
was
not
represented
by
even
a
village
pond
when
we
were
in
washington
the
children
usually
went
with
their
mother
to
the
episcopal
church
while
i
went
to
the
dutch
reformed
but
if
any
child
misbehaved
itself
it
was
sometimes
sent
next
sunday
to
church
with
me
on
the
theory
that
my
companionship
would
have
a
sedative
effect
which
it
did
as
i
and
the
child
walked
along
with
rather
constrained
politeness
each
eying
the
other
with
watchful
readiness
for
the
unexpected
on
one
occasion
when
the
child
conduct
fell
just
short
of
warranting
such
extreme
measures
his
mother
as
they
were
on
the
point
of
entering
church
concluded
a
homily
by
a
quotation
which
showed
a
certain
haziness
of
memory
concerning
the
marriage
and
baptismal
services
no
little
boy
if
this
conduct
continues
i
shall
think
that
you
neither
love
honor
nor
obey
me
however
the
culprit
was
much
impressed
with
a
sense
of
shortcoming
as
to
the
obligations
he
had
undertaken
so
the
result
was
as
satisfactory
as
if
the
quotation
had
been
from
the
right
service
as
for
the
education
of
the
children
there
was
of
course
much
of
it
that
represented
downright
hard
work
and
drudgery
there
was
also
much
training
that
came
as
a
and
was
perhaps
almost
as
valuable
not
as
a
substitute
but
as
an
addition
after
their
supper
the
children
when
little
would
come
trotting
up
to
their
room
to
be
read
to
and
it
was
always
a
surprise
to
me
to
notice
the
extremely
varied
reading
which
interested
them
from
howard
robin
hood
mary
alicia
owen
voodoo
tales
and
joel
chandler
harris
aaron
in
the
wild
woods
to
lycides
and
king
john
if
their
mother
was
absent
i
would
try
to
act
as
a
poor
substitute
i
fear
superintending
the
supper
and
reading
aloud
afterwards
the
children
did
not
wish
me
to
read
the
books
they
desired
their
mother
to
read
and
i
usually
took
some
such
book
as
hereward
the
wake
or
guy
mannering
or
the
last
of
the
mohicans
or
else
some
story
about
a
tiger
or
a
lion
from
one
of
the
hunting
books
in
my
library
these
latter
stories
were
always
favorites
and
as
the
authors
told
them
in
the
first
person
my
interested
auditors
grew
to
know
them
by
the
name
of
the
i
stories
and
regarded
them
as
adventures
all
of
which
happened
to
the
same
individual
when
selous
the
african
hunter
visited
us
i
had
to
get
him
to
tell
to
the
younger
children
two
or
three
of
the
stories
with
which
they
were
already
familiar
from
my
reading
and
as
selous
is
a
most
graphic
narrator
and
always
enters
thoroughly
into
the
feeling
not
only
of
himself
but
of
the
opposing
lion
or
buffalo
my
own
rendering
of
the
incidents
was
cast
entirely
into
the
shade
besides
profiting
by
the
more
canonical
books
on
education
we
profited
by
certain
essays
and
articles
of
a
less
orthodox
type
i
wish
to
express
my
warmest
gratitude
for
such
books
not
of
avowedly
didactic
purpose
as
laura
richards
books
josephine
dodge
daskam
madness
of
philip
palmer
cox
queer
people
the
melodies
of
father
goose
and
mother
wild
goose
flandreau
white
myra
kelly
stories
of
her
little
east
side
pupils
and
michelson
madigans
it
is
well
to
take
duties
and
life
generally
seriously
it
is
also
well
to
remember
that
a
sense
of
humor
is
a
healthy
to
that
portentous
seriousness
which
defeats
its
own
purpose
occasionally
bits
of
proved
of
unexpected
help
to
the
children
in
later
years
like
other
children
they
were
apt
to
take
to
bed
with
them
treasures
which
they
particularly
esteemed
one
of
the
boys
just
before
his
sixteenth
birthday
went
moose
hunting
with
the
family
doctor
and
close
personal
friend
of
the
entire
family
alexander
lambert
once
night
overtook
them
before
they
camped
and
they
had
to
lie
down
just
where
they
were
next
morning
lambert
rather
enviously
congratulated
the
boy
on
the
fact
that
stones
and
roots
evidently
did
not
interfere
with
the
soundness
of
his
sleep
to
which
the
boy
responded
well
doctor
you
see
it
is
very
long
since
i
used
to
take
fourteen
china
animals
to
bed
with
me
every
night
as
the
children
grew
up
sagamore
hill
remained
delightful
for
them
there
were
picnics
and
riding
parties
there
were
dances
in
the
north
room
sometimes
fancy
dress
dances
and
plays
on
the
green
tennis
court
of
one
of
the
cousin
houses
the
children
are
no
longer
children
now
most
of
them
are
men
and
women
working
out
their
own
fates
in
the
big
world
some
in
our
own
land
others
across
the
great
oceans
or
where
the
southern
cross
blazes
in
the
tropic
nights
some
of
them
have
children
of
their
own
some
are
working
at
one
thing
some
at
another
in
cable
ships
in
business
offices
in
factories
in
newspaper
offices
building
steel
bridges
bossing
gravel
trains
and
steam
shovels
or
laying
tracks
and
superintending
freight
traffic
they
have
had
their
share
of
accidents
and
escapes
as
i
write
word
comes
from
a
land
that
one
of
them
whom
seth
bullock
used
to
call
kim
because
he
was
the
friend
of
all
mankind
while
bossing
a
dangerous
but
necessary
steel
structural
job
has
had
two
ribs
and
two
back
teeth
broken
and
is
back
at
work
they
have
known
and
they
will
know
joy
and
sorrow
triumph
and
temporary
defeat
but
i
believe
they
are
all
the
better
off
because
of
their
happy
and
healthy
childhood
it
is
impossible
to
win
the
great
prizes
of
life
without
running
risks
and
the
greatest
of
all
prizes
are
those
connected
with
the
home
no
father
and
mother
can
hope
to
escape
sorrow
and
anxiety
and
there
are
dreadful
moments
when
death
comes
very
near
those
we
love
even
if
for
the
time
being
it
passes
by
but
life
is
a
great
adventure
and
the
worst
of
all
fears
is
the
fear
of
living
there
are
many
forms
of
success
many
forms
of
triumph
but
there
is
no
other
success
that
in
any
shape
or
way
approaches
that
which
is
open
to
most
of
the
many
many
men
and
women
who
have
the
right
ideals
these
are
the
men
and
the
women
who
see
that
it
is
the
intimate
and
homely
things
that
count
most
they
are
the
men
and
women
who
have
the
courage
to
strive
for
the
happiness
which
comes
only
with
labor
and
effort
and
and
only
to
those
whose
joy
in
life
springs
in
part
from
power
of
work
and
sense
of
duty
chapter
x
the
presidency
making
an
old
party
progressive
on
september
president
mckinley
was
shot
by
an
anarchist
in
the
city
of
buffalo
i
went
to
buffalo
at
once
the
president
condition
seemed
to
be
improving
and
after
a
day
or
two
we
were
told
that
he
was
practically
out
of
danger
i
then
joined
my
family
who
were
in
the
adirondacks
near
the
foot
of
mount
tahawus
a
day
or
two
afterwards
we
took
a
long
tramp
through
the
forest
and
in
the
afternoon
i
climbed
mount
tahawus
after
reaching
the
top
i
had
descended
a
few
hundred
feet
to
a
shelf
of
land
where
there
was
a
little
lake
when
i
saw
a
guide
coming
out
of
the
woods
on
our
trail
from
below
i
felt
at
once
that
he
had
bad
news
and
sure
enough
he
handed
me
a
telegram
saying
that
the
president
condition
was
much
worse
and
that
i
must
come
to
buffalo
immediately
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
darkness
had
fallen
by
the
time
i
reached
the
clubhouse
where
we
were
staying
it
was
some
time
afterwards
before
i
could
get
a
wagon
to
drive
me
out
to
the
nearest
railway
station
north
creek
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
distant
the
roads
were
the
ordinary
wilderness
roads
and
the
night
was
dark
but
we
changed
horses
two
or
three
times
when
i
say
we
i
mean
the
driver
and
i
as
there
was
no
one
else
with
us
and
reached
the
station
just
at
dawn
to
learn
from
loeb
who
had
a
special
train
waiting
that
the
president
was
dead
that
evening
i
took
the
oath
of
office
in
the
house
of
ansley
wilcox
at
buffalo
on
three
previous
occasions
the
had
succeeded
to
the
presidency
on
the
death
of
the
president
in
each
case
there
had
been
a
reversal
of
party
policy
and
a
nearly
immediate
and
nearly
complete
change
in
the
personnel
of
the
higher
offices
especially
the
cabinet
i
had
never
felt
that
this
was
wise
from
any
standpoint
if
a
man
is
fit
to
be
president
he
will
speedily
so
impress
himself
in
the
office
that
the
policies
pursued
will
be
his
anyhow
and
he
will
not
have
to
bother
as
to
whether
he
is
changing
them
or
not
while
as
regards
the
offices
under
him
the
important
thing
for
him
is
that
his
subordinates
shall
make
a
success
in
handling
their
several
departments
the
subordinate
is
sure
to
desire
to
make
a
success
of
his
department
for
his
own
sake
and
if
he
is
a
fit
man
whose
views
on
public
policy
are
sound
and
whose
abilities
entitle
him
to
his
position
he
will
do
excellently
under
almost
any
chief
with
the
same
purposes
i
at
once
announced
that
i
would
continue
unchanged
mckinley
policies
for
the
honor
and
prosperity
of
the
country
and
i
asked
all
the
members
of
the
cabinet
to
stay
there
were
no
changes
made
among
them
save
as
changes
were
made
among
their
successors
whom
i
myself
appointed
i
continued
mckinley
policies
changing
and
developing
them
and
adding
new
policies
only
as
the
questions
before
the
public
changed
and
as
the
needs
of
the
public
developed
some
of
my
friends
shook
their
heads
over
this
telling
me
that
the
men
i
retained
would
not
be
loyal
to
me
and
that
i
would
seem
as
if
i
were
a
pale
copy
of
mckinley
i
told
them
that
i
was
not
nervous
on
this
score
and
that
if
the
men
i
retained
were
loyal
to
their
work
they
would
be
giving
me
the
loyalty
for
which
i
most
cared
and
that
if
they
were
not
i
would
change
them
anyhow
and
that
as
for
being
a
pale
copy
of
mckinley
i
was
not
primarily
concerned
with
either
following
or
not
following
in
his
footsteps
but
in
facing
the
new
problems
that
arose
and
that
if
i
were
competent
i
would
find
ample
opportunity
to
show
my
competence
by
my
deeds
without
worrying
myself
as
to
how
to
convince
people
of
the
fact
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
given
in
my
chapter
on
the
governorship
of
new
york
the
republican
party
which
in
the
days
of
abraham
lincoln
was
founded
as
the
radical
progressive
party
of
the
nation
had
been
obliged
during
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
uphold
the
interests
of
popular
government
against
a
foolish
and
illjudged
it
remained
the
nationalist
as
against
the
particularist
or
state
rights
party
and
in
so
far
it
remained
absolutely
sound
for
little
permanent
good
can
be
done
by
any
party
which
worships
the
state
rights
fetish
or
which
fails
to
regard
the
state
like
the
county
or
the
municipality
as
merely
a
convenient
unit
for
local
while
in
all
national
matters
of
importance
to
the
whole
people
the
nation
is
to
be
supreme
over
state
county
and
town
alike
but
the
state
rights
fetish
although
still
effectively
used
at
certain
times
by
both
courts
and
congress
to
block
needed
national
legislation
directed
against
the
huge
corporations
or
in
the
interests
of
workingmen
was
not
a
prime
issue
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
in
and
the
campaigns
were
waged
on
two
great
moral
issues
the
imperative
need
of
a
sound
and
honest
currency
the
need
after
of
meeting
in
manful
and
straightforward
fashion
the
extraterritorial
problems
arising
from
the
spanish
war
on
these
great
moral
issues
the
republican
party
was
right
and
the
men
who
were
opposed
to
it
and
who
claimed
to
be
the
radicals
and
their
allies
among
the
sentimentalists
were
utterly
and
hopelessly
wrong
this
had
regrettably
but
perhaps
inevitably
tended
to
throw
the
party
into
the
hands
not
merely
of
the
conservatives
but
of
the
reactionaries
of
men
who
sometimes
for
personal
and
improper
reasons
but
more
often
with
entire
sincerity
and
uprightness
of
purpose
distrusted
anything
that
was
progressive
and
dreaded
radicalism
these
men
still
from
force
of
habit
applauded
what
lincoln
had
done
in
the
way
of
radical
dealing
with
the
abuses
of
his
day
but
they
did
not
apply
the
spirit
in
which
lincoln
worked
to
the
abuses
of
their
own
day
both
houses
of
congress
were
controlled
by
these
men
their
leaders
in
the
senate
were
aldrich
and
hale
the
speaker
of
the
house
when
i
became
president
was
henderson
but
in
a
little
over
a
year
he
was
succeeded
by
cannon
who
although
widely
differing
from
senator
aldrich
in
matters
of
detail
represented
the
same
type
of
public
sentiment
there
were
many
points
on
which
i
agreed
with
cannon
and
aldrich
and
some
points
on
which
i
agreed
with
hale
i
made
a
resolute
effort
to
get
on
with
all
three
and
with
their
followers
and
i
have
no
question
that
they
made
an
equally
resolute
effort
to
get
on
with
me
we
succeeded
in
working
together
although
with
increasing
friction
for
some
years
i
pushing
forward
and
they
hanging
back
gradually
however
i
was
forced
to
abandon
the
effort
to
persuade
them
to
come
my
way
and
then
i
achieved
results
only
by
appealing
over
the
heads
of
the
senate
and
house
leaders
to
the
people
who
were
the
masters
of
both
of
us
i
continued
in
this
way
to
get
results
until
almost
the
close
of
my
term
and
the
republican
party
became
once
more
the
progressive
and
indeed
the
fairly
radical
progressive
party
of
the
nation
when
my
successor
was
chosen
however
the
leaders
of
the
house
and
senate
or
most
of
them
felt
that
it
was
safe
to
come
to
a
break
with
me
and
the
last
or
short
session
of
congress
held
between
the
election
of
my
successor
and
his
inauguration
four
months
later
saw
a
series
of
contests
between
the
majorities
in
the
two
houses
of
congress
and
the
president
myself
quite
as
bitter
as
if
they
and
i
had
belonged
to
opposite
political
parties
however
i
held
my
own
i
was
not
able
to
push
through
the
legislation
i
desired
during
these
four
months
but
i
was
able
to
prevent
them
doing
anything
i
did
not
desire
or
undoing
anything
that
i
had
already
succeeded
in
getting
done
there
were
of
course
many
senators
and
members
of
the
lower
house
with
whom
up
to
the
very
last
i
continued
to
work
in
hearty
accord
and
with
a
growing
understanding
i
have
not
the
space
to
enumerate
as
i
would
like
to
these
men
for
many
years
senator
lodge
had
been
my
close
personal
and
political
friend
with
whom
i
discussed
all
public
questions
that
arose
usually
with
agreement
and
our
intimately
close
relations
were
of
course
unchanged
by
my
entry
into
the
white
house
he
was
of
all
our
public
men
the
man
who
had
made
the
closest
and
wisest
study
of
our
foreign
relations
and
more
clearly
than
almost
any
other
man
he
understood
the
vital
fact
that
the
efficiency
of
our
navy
conditioned
our
national
efficiency
in
foreign
affairs
anything
relating
to
our
international
relations
from
panama
and
the
navy
to
the
alaskan
boundary
question
the
algeciras
negotiations
or
the
peace
of
portsmouth
i
was
certain
to
discuss
with
senator
lodge
and
also
with
certain
other
members
of
congress
such
as
senator
turner
of
washington
and
representative
hitt
of
illinois
anything
relating
to
labor
legislation
and
to
measures
for
controlling
big
business
or
efficiently
regulating
the
giant
railway
systems
i
was
certain
to
discuss
with
senator
dolliver
or
congressman
hepburn
or
congressman
cooper
with
men
like
senator
beveridge
congressman
afterwards
senator
dixon
and
congressman
murdock
i
was
apt
to
discuss
pretty
nearly
everything
relating
to
either
our
internal
or
our
external
affairs
there
were
many
many
others
the
present
president
of
the
senate
senator
clark
of
arkansas
was
as
fearless
and
a
representative
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
i
ever
dealt
with
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
combined
loyalty
to
his
own
state
with
an
equally
keen
loyalty
to
the
people
of
all
the
united
states
he
was
politically
opposed
to
me
but
when
the
interests
of
the
country
were
at
stake
he
was
incapable
of
considering
party
differences
and
this
was
especially
his
attitude
in
international
matters
including
certain
treaties
which
most
of
his
party
colleagues
with
narrow
lack
of
patriotism
and
complete
subordination
of
national
to
factional
interest
opposed
i
have
never
anywhere
met
finer
more
faithful
more
disinterested
and
more
loyal
public
servants
than
senator
platt
a
republican
from
connecticut
and
senator
cockrell
a
democrat
from
missouri
they
were
already
old
men
when
i
came
to
the
presidency
and
doubtless
there
were
points
on
which
i
seemed
to
them
to
be
extreme
and
radical
but
eventually
they
found
that
our
motives
and
beliefs
were
the
same
and
they
did
all
in
their
power
to
help
any
movement
that
was
for
the
interest
of
our
people
as
a
whole
i
had
met
them
when
i
was
civil
service
commissioner
and
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
all
i
ever
had
to
do
with
either
was
to
convince
him
that
a
given
measure
i
championed
was
right
and
he
then
at
once
did
all
he
could
to
have
it
put
into
effect
if
i
could
not
convince
them
why
that
was
my
fault
or
my
misfortune
but
if
i
could
convince
them
i
never
had
to
think
again
as
to
whether
they
would
or
would
not
support
me
there
were
many
other
men
of
mark
in
both
houses
with
whom
i
could
work
on
some
points
whereas
on
others
we
had
to
differ
there
was
one
powerful
leader
a
burly
forceful
man
of
admirable
traits
who
had
however
been
trained
in
the
school
of
business
and
politics
so
that
his
attitude
towards
life
quite
unconsciously
reminded
me
a
little
of
artemus
ward
view
of
the
tower
of
london
if
i
like
it
i
buy
it
there
was
a
big
governmental
job
in
which
this
leader
was
much
interested
and
in
reference
to
which
he
always
wished
me
to
consult
a
man
whom
he
trusted
whom
i
will
call
pitt
rodney
one
day
i
answered
him
the
trouble
with
rodney
is
that
he
misestimates
his
relations
to
cosmos
to
which
he
responded
cosmos
cosmos
never
heard
of
him
you
stick
to
rodney
he
your
man
outside
of
the
public
servants
there
were
multitudes
of
men
in
newspaper
offices
in
magazine
offices
in
business
or
the
professions
or
on
farms
or
in
shops
who
actively
supported
the
policies
for
which
i
stood
and
did
work
of
genuine
leadership
which
was
quite
as
effective
as
any
work
done
by
men
in
public
office
without
the
active
support
of
these
men
i
would
have
been
powerless
in
particular
the
leading
newspaper
correspondents
at
washington
were
as
a
whole
a
singularly
able
trustworthy
and
body
of
men
and
the
most
useful
of
all
agents
in
the
fight
for
efficient
and
decent
government
as
for
the
men
under
me
in
executive
office
i
could
not
overstate
the
debt
of
gratitude
i
owe
them
from
the
heads
of
the
departments
the
cabinet
officers
down
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
administration
was
the
devoted
zealous
and
efficient
work
that
was
done
as
soon
as
it
became
understood
that
the
one
bond
of
interest
among
all
of
us
was
the
desire
to
make
the
government
the
most
effective
instrument
in
advancing
the
interests
of
the
people
as
a
whole
the
interests
of
the
average
men
and
women
of
the
united
states
and
of
their
children
i
do
not
think
i
overstate
the
case
when
i
say
that
most
of
the
men
who
did
the
best
work
under
me
felt
that
ours
was
a
partnership
that
we
all
stood
on
the
same
level
of
purpose
and
service
and
that
it
mattered
not
what
position
any
one
of
us
held
so
long
as
in
that
position
he
gave
the
very
best
that
was
in
him
we
worked
very
hard
but
i
made
a
point
of
getting
a
couple
of
hours
off
each
day
for
equally
vigorous
play
the
men
with
whom
i
then
played
whom
we
laughingly
grew
to
call
the
tennis
cabinet
have
been
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
of
this
book
in
connection
with
the
gift
they
gave
me
at
the
last
breakfast
which
they
took
at
the
white
house
there
were
many
others
in
the
public
service
under
me
with
whom
i
happened
not
to
play
but
who
did
their
share
of
our
common
work
just
as
effectively
as
it
was
done
by
us
who
did
play
of
course
nothing
could
have
been
done
in
my
administration
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
zeal
intelligence
masterful
ability
and
downright
hard
labor
of
these
men
in
countless
positions
under
me
i
was
helpless
to
do
anything
except
as
my
thoughts
and
orders
were
translated
into
action
by
them
and
moreover
each
of
them
as
he
grew
specially
fit
for
his
job
used
to
suggest
to
me
the
right
thought
to
have
and
the
right
order
to
give
concerning
that
job
it
is
of
course
hard
for
me
to
speak
with
cold
and
dispassionate
partiality
of
these
men
who
were
as
close
to
me
as
were
the
men
of
my
regiment
but
the
outside
observers
best
fitted
to
pass
judgment
about
them
felt
as
i
did
at
the
end
of
my
administration
bryce
the
british
ambassador
told
me
that
in
a
long
life
during
which
he
had
studied
intimately
the
government
of
many
different
countries
he
had
never
in
any
country
seen
a
more
eager
and
efficient
set
of
public
servants
men
more
useful
and
more
creditable
to
their
country
than
the
men
then
doing
the
work
of
the
american
government
in
washington
and
in
the
field
i
repeat
this
statement
with
the
permission
of
bryce
at
about
the
same
time
or
a
little
before
in
the
spring
of
there
appeared
in
the
english
an
article
evidently
by
a
competent
eye
witness
setting
forth
more
in
detail
the
same
views
to
which
the
british
ambassador
thus
privately
gave
expression
it
was
in
part
as
follows
roosevelt
has
gathered
around
him
a
body
of
public
servants
who
are
nowhere
surpassed
i
question
whether
they
are
anywhere
equaled
for
efficiency
and
an
absolute
devotion
to
their
interests
many
of
them
are
poor
men
without
private
means
who
have
voluntarily
abandoned
high
professional
ambitions
and
turned
their
backs
on
the
rewards
of
business
to
serve
their
country
on
salaries
that
are
not
merely
inadequate
but
indecently
so
there
is
not
one
of
them
who
is
not
constantly
assailed
by
offers
of
positions
in
the
world
of
commerce
finance
and
the
law
that
would
satisfy
every
material
ambition
with
which
he
began
life
there
is
not
one
of
them
who
could
not
if
he
chose
earn
outside
washington
from
ten
to
twenty
times
the
income
on
which
he
economizes
as
a
state
official
but
these
men
are
as
indifferent
to
money
and
to
the
power
that
money
brings
as
to
the
allurements
of
newport
and
new
york
or
to
merely
personal
distinctions
or
to
the
commercialized
ideals
which
the
great
bulk
of
their
accept
without
question
they
are
content
and
more
than
content
to
sink
themselves
in
the
national
service
without
a
thought
of
private
advancement
and
often
at
a
heavy
sacrifice
of
worldly
honors
and
to
toil
on
sustained
by
their
own
native
impulse
to
make
of
patriotism
an
efficient
instrument
of
public
betterment
the
american
public
rarely
appreciate
the
high
quality
of
the
work
done
by
some
of
our
diplomats
work
usually
entirely
unnoticed
and
unrewarded
which
redounds
to
the
interest
and
the
honor
of
all
of
us
the
most
useful
man
in
the
entire
diplomatic
service
during
my
presidency
and
for
many
years
before
was
henry
white
and
i
say
this
having
in
mind
the
high
quality
of
work
done
by
such
admirable
ambassadors
and
ministers
as
bacon
meyer
straus
rockhill
and
egan
to
name
only
a
few
among
many
when
i
left
the
presidency
white
was
ambassador
to
france
shortly
afterwards
he
was
removed
by
taft
for
reasons
unconnected
with
the
good
of
the
service
the
most
important
factor
in
getting
the
right
spirit
in
my
administration
next
to
the
insistence
upon
courage
honesty
and
a
genuine
democracy
of
desire
to
serve
the
plain
people
was
my
insistence
upon
the
theory
that
the
executive
power
was
limited
only
by
specific
restrictions
and
prohibitions
appearing
in
the
constitution
or
imposed
by
the
congress
under
its
constitutional
powers
my
view
was
that
every
executive
officer
and
above
all
every
executive
officer
in
high
position
was
a
steward
of
the
people
bound
actively
and
affirmatively
to
do
all
he
could
for
the
people
and
not
to
content
himself
with
the
negative
merit
of
keeping
his
talents
undamaged
in
a
napkin
i
declined
to
adopt
the
view
that
what
was
imperatively
necessary
for
the
nation
could
not
be
done
by
the
president
unless
he
could
find
some
specific
authorization
to
do
it
my
belief
was
that
it
was
not
only
his
right
but
his
duty
to
do
anything
that
the
needs
of
the
nation
demanded
unless
such
action
was
forbidden
by
the
constitution
or
by
the
laws
under
this
interpretation
of
executive
power
i
did
and
caused
to
be
done
many
things
not
previously
done
by
the
president
and
the
heads
of
the
departments
i
did
not
usurp
power
but
i
did
greatly
broaden
the
use
of
executive
power
in
other
words
i
acted
for
the
public
welfare
i
acted
for
the
common
of
all
our
people
whenever
and
in
whatever
manner
was
necessary
unless
prevented
by
direct
constitutional
or
legislative
prohibition
i
did
not
care
a
rap
for
the
mere
form
and
show
of
power
i
cared
immensely
for
the
use
that
could
be
made
of
the
substance
the
senate
at
one
time
objected
to
my
communicating
with
them
in
printing
preferring
the
expensive
foolish
and
laborious
practice
of
writing
out
the
messages
by
hand
it
was
not
possible
to
return
to
the
outworn
archaism
of
hand
writing
but
we
endeavored
to
have
the
printing
made
as
pretty
as
possible
whether
i
communicated
with
the
congress
in
writing
or
by
word
of
mouth
and
whether
the
writing
was
by
a
machine
or
a
pen
were
equally
and
absolutely
unimportant
matters
the
importance
lay
in
what
i
said
and
in
the
heed
paid
to
what
i
said
so
as
to
my
meeting
and
consulting
senators
congressmen
politicians
financiers
and
labor
men
i
consulted
all
who
wished
to
see
me
and
if
i
wished
to
see
any
one
i
sent
for
him
and
where
the
consultation
took
place
was
a
matter
of
supreme
unimportance
i
consulted
every
man
with
the
sincere
hope
that
i
could
profit
by
and
follow
his
advice
i
consulted
every
member
of
congress
who
wished
to
be
consulted
hoping
to
be
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
of
action
with
him
and
i
always
finally
acted
as
my
conscience
and
common
sense
bade
me
act
about
appointments
i
was
obliged
by
the
constitution
to
consult
the
senate
and
the
custom
of
the
senate
meant
that
in
practice
this
consultation
was
with
individual
senators
and
even
with
big
politicians
who
stood
behind
the
senators
i
was
only
the
appointing
power
i
nominated
but
the
senate
confirmed
in
practice
by
what
was
called
the
courtesy
of
the
senate
the
senate
normally
refused
to
confirm
any
appointment
if
the
senator
from
the
state
objected
to
it
in
exceptional
cases
where
i
could
arouse
public
attention
i
could
force
through
the
appointment
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
senators
in
all
ordinary
cases
this
was
impossible
on
the
other
hand
the
senator
could
of
course
do
nothing
for
any
man
unless
i
chose
to
nominate
him
in
consequence
the
constitution
itself
forced
the
president
and
the
senators
from
each
state
to
come
to
a
working
agreement
on
the
appointments
in
and
from
that
state
my
course
was
to
insist
on
absolute
fitness
including
honesty
as
a
prerequisite
to
every
appointment
and
to
remove
only
for
good
cause
and
where
there
was
such
cause
to
refuse
even
to
discuss
with
the
senator
in
interest
the
unfit
servant
retention
subject
to
these
considerations
i
normally
accepted
each
senator
recommendations
for
offices
of
a
routine
kind
such
as
most
and
the
like
but
insisted
on
myself
choosing
the
men
for
the
more
important
positions
i
was
willing
to
take
any
good
man
for
postmaster
but
in
the
case
of
a
judge
or
district
attorney
or
canal
commissioner
or
ambassador
i
was
apt
to
insist
either
on
a
given
man
or
else
on
any
man
with
a
given
class
of
qualifications
if
the
senator
deceived
me
i
took
care
that
he
had
no
opportunity
to
repeat
the
deception
i
can
perhaps
best
illustrate
my
theory
of
action
by
two
specific
examples
in
new
york
governor
odell
and
senator
platt
sometimes
worked
in
agreement
and
sometimes
were
at
swords
points
and
both
wished
to
be
consulted
to
a
friendly
congressman
who
was
also
their
friend
i
wrote
as
follows
on
july
i
want
to
work
with
platt
i
want
to
work
with
odell
i
want
to
support
both
and
take
the
advice
of
both
but
of
course
ultimately
i
must
be
the
judge
as
to
acting
on
the
advice
given
when
as
in
the
case
of
the
judgeship
i
am
convinced
that
the
advice
of
both
is
wrong
i
shall
act
as
i
did
when
i
appointed
holt
when
i
can
find
a
friend
of
like
cooley
who
is
thoroughly
fit
for
the
position
i
desire
to
fill
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
appoint
him
when
platt
proposes
to
me
a
man
like
hamilton
fish
it
is
equally
a
pleasure
to
appoint
him
this
was
written
in
connection
with
events
which
led
up
to
my
refusing
to
accept
senator
platt
or
governor
odell
suggestions
as
to
a
federal
judgeship
and
a
federal
district
attorneyship
and
insisting
on
the
appointment
first
of
judge
hough
and
later
of
district
attorney
stimson
because
in
each
case
i
felt
that
the
work
to
be
done
was
of
so
high
an
order
that
i
could
not
take
an
ordinary
man
the
other
case
was
that
of
senator
fulton
of
oregon
through
francis
heney
i
was
prosecuting
men
who
were
implicated
in
a
vast
network
of
conspiracy
against
the
law
in
connection
with
the
theft
of
public
land
in
oregon
i
had
been
acting
on
senator
fulton
recommendations
for
office
in
the
usual
manner
heney
had
been
insisting
that
fulton
was
in
league
with
the
men
we
were
prosecuting
and
that
he
had
recommended
unfit
men
fulton
had
been
protesting
against
my
following
advice
particularly
as
regards
appointing
judge
wolverton
as
united
states
judge
finally
heney
laid
before
me
a
report
which
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
his
statements
i
then
wrote
to
fulton
as
follows
on
november
my
dear
senator
fulton
i
inclose
you
herewith
a
copy
of
the
report
made
to
me
by
heney
i
have
seen
the
originals
of
the
letters
from
you
and
senator
mitchell
quoted
therein
i
do
not
at
this
time
desire
to
discuss
the
report
itself
which
of
course
i
must
submit
to
the
but
i
have
been
obliged
to
reach
the
painful
conclusion
that
your
own
letters
as
therein
quoted
tend
to
show
that
you
recommended
for
the
position
of
district
attorney
b
when
you
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
himself
been
guilty
of
fraudulent
conduct
that
you
recommended
c
for
the
same
position
simply
because
it
was
for
b
interest
that
he
should
be
so
recommended
and
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
because
he
had
agreed
to
divide
the
fees
with
b
if
he
were
appointed
and
that
you
finally
recommended
the
reappointment
of
h
with
the
knowledge
that
if
h
were
appointed
he
would
abstain
from
prosecuting
b
for
criminal
misconduct
this
being
why
b
advocated
claims
for
reappointment
if
you
care
to
make
any
statement
in
the
matter
i
shall
of
course
be
glad
to
hear
it
as
the
district
judge
of
oregon
i
shall
appoint
judge
wolverton
in
the
letter
i
of
course
gave
in
full
the
names
indicated
above
by

senator
fulton
gave
no
explanation
i
therefore
ceased
to
consult
him
about
appointments
under
the
department
of
justice
and
the
interior
the
two
departments
in
which
the
crookedness
had
occurred
there
was
no
question
of
crookedness
in
the
other
offices
in
the
state
and
they
could
be
handled
in
the
ordinary
manner
legal
proceedings
were
undertaken
against
his
colleague
in
the
senate
and
one
of
his
colleagues
in
the
lower
house
and
the
former
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
in
a
number
of
instances
the
legality
of
executive
acts
of
my
administration
was
brought
before
the
courts
they
were
uniformly
sustained
for
example
prior
to
statutes
relating
to
the
disposition
of
coal
lands
had
been
construed
as
fixing
the
flat
price
at
to
per
acre
the
result
was
that
valuable
coal
lands
were
sold
for
wholly
inadequate
prices
chiefly
to
big
corporations
by
executive
order
the
coal
lands
were
withdrawn
and
not
opened
for
entry
until
proper
classification
was
placed
thereon
by
government
agents
there
was
a
great
clamor
that
i
was
usurping
legislative
power
but
the
acts
were
not
assailed
in
court
until
we
brought
suits
to
set
aside
entries
made
by
persons
and
associations
to
obtain
larger
areas
than
the
statutes
authorized
this
position
was
opposed
on
the
ground
that
the
restrictions
imposed
were
illegal
that
the
executive
orders
were
illegal
the
supreme
court
sustained
the
government
in
the
same
way
our
attitude
in
the
water
power
question
was
sustained
the
supreme
court
holding
that
the
federal
government
had
the
rights
we
claimed
over
streams
that
are
or
may
be
declared
navigable
by
congress
again
when
oklahoma
became
a
state
we
were
obliged
to
use
the
executive
power
to
protect
indian
rights
and
property
for
there
had
been
an
enormous
amount
of
fraud
in
the
obtaining
of
indian
lands
by
white
men
here
we
were
denounced
as
usurping
power
over
a
state
as
well
as
usurping
power
that
did
not
belong
to
the
executive
the
supreme
court
sustained
our
action
in
connection
with
the
indians
by
the
way
it
was
again
and
again
necessary
to
assert
the
position
of
the
president
as
steward
of
the
whole
people
i
had
a
capital
indian
commissioner
francis
leupp
i
found
that
i
could
rely
on
his
judgment
not
to
get
me
into
fights
that
were
unnecessary
and
therefore
i
always
backed
him
to
the
limit
when
he
told
me
that
a
fight
was
necessary
on
one
occasion
for
example
congress
passed
a
bill
to
sell
to
settlers
about
half
a
million
acres
of
indian
land
in
oklahoma
at
one
and
a
half
dollars
an
acre
i
refused
to
sign
it
and
turned
the
matter
over
to
leupp
the
bill
was
accordingly
withdrawn
amended
so
as
to
safeguard
the
welfare
of
the
indians
and
the
minimum
price
raised
to
five
dollars
an
acre
then
i
signed
the
bill
we
sold
that
land
under
sealed
bids
and
realized
for
the
kiowa
comanche
and
apache
indians
more
than
four
million
dollars
three
millions
and
a
quarter
more
than
they
would
have
obtained
if
i
had
signed
the
bill
in
its
original
form
in
another
case
where
there
had
been
a
division
among
the
sac
and
fox
indians
part
of
the
tribe
removing
to
iowa
the
iowa
delegation
in
congress
backed
by
two
iowans
who
were
members
of
my
cabinet
passed
a
bill
awarding
a
sum
of
nearly
a
half
million
dollars
to
the
iowa
seceders
they
had
not
consulted
the
indian
bureau
leupp
protested
against
the
bill
and
i
vetoed
it
a
subsequent
bill
was
passed
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
indian
bureau
referring
the
whole
controversy
to
the
courts
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
end
justified
our
position
by
deciding
against
the
iowa
seceders
and
awarding
the
money
to
the
oklahoma
as
to
all
action
of
this
kind
there
have
long
been
two
schools
of
political
thought
upheld
with
equal
sincerity
the
division
has
not
normally
been
along
political
but
temperamental
lines
the
course
i
followed
of
regarding
the
executive
as
subject
only
to
the
people
and
under
the
constitution
bound
to
serve
the
people
affirmatively
in
cases
where
the
constitution
does
not
explicitly
forbid
him
to
render
the
service
was
substantially
the
course
followed
by
both
andrew
jackson
and
abraham
lincoln
other
honorable
and
presidents
such
as
james
buchanan
took
the
opposite
and
as
it
seems
to
me
narrowly
legalistic
view
that
the
president
is
the
servant
of
congress
rather
than
of
the
people
and
can
do
nothing
no
matter
how
necessary
it
be
to
act
unless
the
constitution
explicitly
commands
the
action
most
able
lawyers
who
are
past
middle
age
take
this
view
and
so
do
large
numbers
of
respectable
citizens
my
successor
in
office
took
this
the
buchanan
view
of
the
president
powers
and
duties
for
example
under
my
administration
we
found
that
one
of
the
favorite
methods
adopted
by
the
men
desirous
of
stealing
the
public
domain
was
to
carry
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
into
court
by
vigorously
opposing
such
action
and
only
by
so
doing
we
were
able
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
properly
protecting
the
public
domain
my
successor
not
only
took
the
opposite
view
but
recommended
to
congress
the
passage
of
a
bill
which
would
have
given
the
courts
direct
appellate
power
over
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
these
land
matters
this
bill
was
reported
favorably
by
mondell
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
public
lands
a
congressman
who
took
the
lead
in
every
measure
to
prevent
the
conservation
of
our
natural
resources
and
the
preservation
of
the
national
domain
for
the
use
of
fortunately
congress
declined
to
pass
the
bill
its
passage
would
have
been
a
veritable
calamity
i
acted
on
the
theory
that
the
president
could
at
any
time
in
his
discretion
withdraw
from
entry
any
of
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states
and
reserve
the
same
for
forestry
for
sites
for
irrigation
and
other
public
purposes
without
such
action
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
stop
the
activity
of
the
land
thieves
no
one
ventured
to
test
its
legality
by
lawsuit
my
successor
however
himself
questioned
it
and
referred
the
matter
to
congress
again
congress
showed
its
wisdom
by
passing
a
law
which
gave
the
president
the
power
which
he
had
long
exercised
and
of
which
my
successor
had
shorn
himself
perhaps
the
sharp
difference
between
what
may
be
called
the
and
the
schools
in
their
views
of
the
power
and
duties
of
the
president
may
be
best
illustrated
by
comparing
the
attitude
of
my
successor
toward
his
secretary
of
the
interior
ballinger
when
the
latter
was
accused
of
gross
misconduct
in
office
with
my
attitude
towards
my
chiefs
of
department
and
other
subordinate
officers
more
than
once
while
i
was
president
my
officials
were
attacked
by
congress
generally
because
these
officials
did
their
duty
well
and
fearlessly
in
every
such
case
i
stood
by
the
official
and
refused
to
recognize
the
right
of
congress
to
interfere
with
me
excepting
by
impeachment
or
in
other
constitutional
manner
on
the
other
hand
wherever
i
found
the
officer
unfit
for
his
position
i
promptly
removed
him
even
although
the
most
influential
men
in
congress
fought
for
his
retention
the
view
is
that
a
president
who
is
fit
to
do
good
work
should
be
able
to
form
his
own
judgment
as
to
his
own
subordinates
and
above
all
of
the
subordinates
standing
highest
and
in
closest
and
most
intimate
touch
with
him
my
secretaries
and
their
subordinates
were
responsible
to
me
and
i
accepted
the
responsibility
for
all
their
deeds
as
long
as
they
were
satisfactory
to
me
i
stood
by
them
against
every
critic
or
assailant
within
or
without
congress
and
as
for
getting
congress
to
make
up
my
mind
for
me
about
them
the
thought
would
have
been
inconceivable
to
me
my
successor
took
the
opposite
or
buchanan
view
when
he
permitted
and
requested
congress
to
pass
judgment
on
the
charges
made
against
ballinger
as
an
executive
officer
these
charges
were
made
to
the
president
the
president
had
the
facts
before
him
and
could
get
at
them
at
any
time
and
he
alone
had
power
to
act
if
the
charges
were
true
however
he
permitted
and
requested
congress
to
investigate
ballinger
the
party
minority
of
the
committee
that
investigated
him
and
one
member
of
the
majority
declared
that
the
charges
were
well
founded
and
that
ballinger
should
be
removed
the
other
members
of
the
majority
declared
the
charges
ill
founded
the
president
abode
by
the
view
of
the
majority
of
course
believers
in
the
theory
of
the
presidency
would
not
be
content
with
this
town
meeting
majority
and
minority
method
of
determining
by
another
branch
of
the
government
what
it
seems
the
especial
duty
of
the
president
himself
to
determine
for
himself
in
dealing
with
his
own
subordinate
in
his
own
department
there
are
many
worthy
people
who
reprobate
the
buchanan
method
as
a
matter
of
history
but
who
in
actual
life
reprobate
still
more
strongly
the
method
when
it
is
put
into
practice
these
persons
conscientiously
believe
that
the
president
should
solve
every
doubt
in
favor
of
inaction
as
against
action
that
he
should
construe
strictly
and
narrowly
the
constitutional
grant
of
powers
both
to
the
national
government
and
to
the
president
within
the
national
government
in
addition
however
to
the
men
who
conscientiously
believe
in
this
course
from
high
although
as
i
hold
misguided
motives
there
are
many
men
who
affect
to
believe
in
it
merely
because
it
enables
them
to
attack
and
to
try
to
hamper
for
partisan
or
personal
reasons
an
executive
whom
they
dislike
there
are
other
men
in
whom
especially
when
they
are
themselves
in
office
practical
adherence
to
the
buchanan
principle
represents
not
devotion
to
an
unwise
course
but
simple
weakness
of
character
and
desire
to
avoid
trouble
and
responsibility
unfortunately
in
practice
it
makes
little
difference
which
class
of
ideas
actuates
the
president
who
by
his
action
sets
a
cramping
precedent
whether
he
is
highminded
and
wrongheaded
or
merely
infirm
of
purpose
whether
he
means
well
feebly
or
is
bound
by
a
mischievous
misconception
of
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
national
government
and
of
the
president
the
effect
of
his
actions
is
the
same
the
duty
is
to
act
so
that
he
himself
and
his
subordinates
shall
be
able
to
do
efficient
work
for
the
people
and
this
efficient
work
he
and
they
can
not
do
if
congress
is
permitted
to
undertake
the
task
of
making
up
his
mind
for
him
as
to
how
he
shall
perform
what
is
clearly
his
sole
duty
one
of
the
ways
in
which
by
independent
action
of
the
executive
we
were
able
to
accomplish
an
immense
amount
of
work
for
the
public
was
through
volunteer
unpaid
commissions
appointed
by
the
president
it
was
possible
to
get
the
work
done
by
these
volunteer
commissions
only
because
of
the
enthusiasm
for
the
public
service
which
starting
in
the
higher
offices
at
washington
made
itself
felt
throughout
the
government
departments
as
i
have
said
i
never
knew
harder
and
more
disinterested
work
done
by
any
people
than
was
done
by
the
men
and
women
of
all
ranks
in
the
government
service
the
contrast
was
really
extraordinary
between
their
live
interest
in
their
work
and
the
traditional
clerical
apathy
which
has
so
often
been
the
distinguishing
note
of
governmental
work
in
washington
most
of
the
public
service
performed
by
these
volunteer
commissions
carried
on
without
a
cent
of
pay
to
the
men
themselves
and
wholly
without
cost
to
the
government
was
done
by
men
the
great
majority
of
whom
were
already
in
the
government
service
and
already
charged
with
responsibilities
amounting
each
to
a
full
man
job
the
first
of
these
commissions
was
the
commission
on
the
organization
of
government
scientific
work
whose
chairman
was
charles
walcott
appointed
march
its
duty
was
to
report
directly
to
the
president
upon
the
organization
present
condition
and
needs
of
the
executive
government
work
wholly
or
partly
scientific
in
character
and
upon
the
steps
which
should
be
taken
if
any
to
prevent
the
duplication
of
such
work
to
its
various
branches
to
increase
its
efficiency
and
economy
and
to
promote
its
usefulness
to
the
nation
at
large
this
commission
spent
four
months
in
an
examination
which
covered
the
work
of
about
thirty
of
the
larger
scientific
and
executive
bureaus
of
the
government
and
prepared
a
report
which
furnished
the
basis
for
numerous
improvements
in
the
government
service
another
commission
appointed
june
was
that
on
department
methods
charles
keep
chairman
whose
task
was
to
find
out
what
changes
are
needed
to
place
the
conduct
of
the
executive
business
of
the
government
in
all
its
branches
on
the
most
economical
and
effective
basis
in
the
light
of
the
best
modern
business
practice
the
letter
appointing
this
commission
laid
down
nine
principles
of
effective
governmental
work
the
most
striking
of
which
was
the
existence
of
any
method
standard
custom
or
practice
is
no
reason
for
its
continuance
when
a
better
is
offered
this
commission
composed
like
that
just
described
of
men
already
charged
with
important
work
performed
its
functions
wholly
without
cost
to
the
government
it
was
assisted
by
a
body
of
about
seventy
experts
in
the
government
departments
chosen
for
their
special
qualifications
to
carry
forward
a
study
of
the
best
methods
in
business
and
organized
into
assistant
committees
under
the
leadership
of
overton
price
secretary
of
the
commission
these
assistant
committees
all
of
whose
members
were
still
carrying
on
their
regular
work
made
their
reports
during
the
last
half
of
the
committee
informed
itself
fully
regarding
the
business
methods
of
practically
every
individual
branch
of
the
business
of
the
government
and
effected
a
marked
improvement
in
general
efficiency
throughout
the
service
the
conduct
of
the
routine
business
of
the
government
had
never
been
thoroughly
overhauled
before
and
this
examination
of
it
resulted
in
the
promulgation
of
a
set
of
working
principles
for
the
transaction
of
public
business
which
are
as
sound
as
they
were
when
the
committee
finished
its
work
the
somewhat
elaborate
and
costly
investigations
of
government
business
methods
since
made
have
served
merely
to
confirm
the
findings
of
the
committee
on
departmental
methods
which
were
achieved
without
costing
the
government
a
dollar
the
actual
saving
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
the
government
through
the
better
methods
thus
introduced
amounted
yearly
to
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
but
a
far
more
important
gain
was
due
to
the
remarkable
success
of
the
commission
in
establishing
a
new
point
of
view
in
public
servants
toward
their
work
the
need
for
improvement
in
the
governmental
methods
of
transacting
business
may
be
illustrated
by
an
actual
case
an
officer
in
charge
of
an
indian
agency
made
a
requisition
in
the
autumn
for
a
stove
costing
seven
dollars
certifying
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
needed
to
keep
the
infirmary
warm
during
the
winter
because
the
old
stove
was
worn
out
thereupon
the
customary
papers
went
through
the
customary
routine
without
unusual
delay
at
any
point
the
transaction
moved
like
a
glacier
with
dignity
to
its
appointed
end
and
the
stove
reached
the
infirmary
in
good
order
in
time
for
the
indian
agent
to
acknowledge
its
arrival
in
these
words
the
stove
is
here
so
is
spring
the
civil
service
commission
under
men
like
john
mcilhenny
and
garfield
rendered
service
without
which
the
government
could
have
been
conducted
with
neither
efficiency
nor
honesty
the
politicians
were
not
the
only
persons
at
fault
almost
as
much
improper
pressure
for
appointments
is
due
to
mere
misplaced
sympathy
and
to
the
spiritless
inefficiency
which
seeks
a
government
office
as
a
haven
for
the
incompetent
an
amusing
feature
of
office
seeking
is
that
each
man
desiring
an
office
is
apt
to
look
down
on
all
others
with
the
same
object
as
forming
an
objectionable
class
with
which
has
nothing
in
common
at
the
time
of
the
eruption
of
mt
pelee
when
among
others
the
american
consul
was
killed
a
man
who
had
long
been
seeking
an
appointment
promptly
applied
for
the
vacancy
he
was
a
good
man
of
persistent
nature
who
felt
i
had
been
somewhat
blind
to
his
merits
the
morning
after
the
catastrophe
he
wrote
saying
that
as
the
consul
was
dead
he
would
like
his
place
and
that
i
could
surely
give
it
to
him
because
even
the
office
seekers
could
not
have
applied
for
it
yet
the
method
of
public
service
involved
in
the
appointment
and
the
work
of
the
two
commissions
just
described
was
applied
also
in
the
establishment
of
four
other
commissions
each
of
which
performed
its
task
without
salary
or
expense
for
its
members
and
wholly
without
cost
to
the
government
the
other
four
commissions
were
commission
on
public
lands
commission
on
inland
waterways
commission
on
country
life
and
commission
on
national
conservation
all
of
these
commissions
were
suggested
to
me
by
gifford
pinchot
who
served
upon
them
all
the
work
of
the
last
four
will
be
touched
upon
in
connection
with
the
chapter
on
conservation
these
commissions
by
their
reports
and
findings
directly
interfered
with
many
who
were
doing
inefficient
work
and
their
reports
and
the
action
taken
thereon
by
the
administration
strengthened
the
hands
of
those
administrative
officers
who
in
the
various
departments
and
especially
in
the
secret
service
were
proceeding
against
land
thieves
and
other
corrupt
moreover
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
efficient
work
for
the
public
along
lines
new
to
veteran
and
cynical
politicians
of
the
old
type
created
vehement
hostility
to
them
senators
like
hale
and
congressmen
like
tawney
were
especially
bitter
against
these
commissions
and
towards
the
end
of
my
term
they
were
followed
by
the
majority
of
their
fellows
in
both
houses
who
had
gradually
been
sundered
from
me
by
the
open
or
covert
hostility
of
the
financial
or
wall
street
leaders
and
of
the
newspaper
editors
and
politicians
who
did
their
bidding
in
the
interest
of
privilege
these
senators
and
congressmen
asserted
that
they
had
a
right
to
forbid
the
president
profiting
by
the
unpaid
advice
of
disinterested
experts
of
course
i
declined
to
admit
the
existence
of
any
such
right
and
continued
the
commissions
my
successor
acknowledged
the
right
upheld
the
view
of
the
politicians
in
question
and
abandoned
the
commissions
to
the
lasting
detriment
of
the
people
as
a
whole
one
thing
is
worth
pointing
out
during
the
seven
and
a
half
years
of
my
administration
we
greatly
and
usefully
extended
the
sphere
of
governmental
action
and
yet
we
reduced
the
burden
of
the
taxpayers
for
we
reduced
the
debt
by
more
than
to
achieve
a
marked
increase
in
efficiency
and
at
the
same
time
an
increase
in
economy
is
not
an
easy
feat
but
we
performed
it
there
was
one
ugly
and
very
necessary
task
this
was
to
discover
and
root
out
corruption
wherever
it
was
found
in
any
of
the
departments
the
first
essential
was
to
make
it
clearly
understood
that
no
political
or
business
or
social
influence
of
any
kind
would
for
one
moment
be
even
considered
when
the
honesty
of
a
public
official
was
at
issue
it
took
a
little
time
to
get
this
fact
thoroughly
drilled
into
the
heads
both
of
the
men
within
the
service
and
of
the
political
leaders
without
the
feat
was
accomplished
so
thoroughly
that
every
effort
to
interfere
in
any
shape
or
way
with
the
course
of
justice
was
abandoned
definitely
and
for
good
most
although
not
all
of
the
frauds
occurred
in
connection
with
the
department
and
the
land
office
it
was
in
the
department
that
we
first
definitely
established
the
rule
of
conduct
which
became
universal
throughout
the
whole
service
rumors
of
corruption
in
the
department
became
rife
and
finally
i
spoke
of
them
to
the
then
first
assistant
afterwards
robert
wynne
he
reported
to
me
after
some
investigation
that
in
his
belief
there
was
doubtless
corruption
but
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
at
it
and
that
the
offenders
were
confident
and
defiant
because
of
their
great
political
and
business
backing
and
the
ramifications
of
their
crimes
talking
the
matter
over
with
him
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
right
man
to
carry
on
the
investigation
was
the
then
fourth
assistant
now
a
senator
from
kansas
joseph
bristow
who
possessed
the
iron
fearlessness
needful
to
front
such
a
situation
bristow
had
perforce
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
seamy
side
of
politics
and
of
the
extent
of
the
unscrupulousness
with
which
powerful
influence
was
brought
to
bear
to
shield
offenders
before
undertaking
the
investigation
he
came
to
see
me
and
said
that
he
did
not
wish
to
go
into
it
unless
he
could
be
assured
that
i
would
stand
personally
behind
him
and
no
matter
where
his
inquiries
led
him
would
support
him
and
prevent
interference
with
him
i
answered
that
i
would
certainly
do
so
he
went
into
the
investigation
with
relentless
energy
dogged
courage
and
keen
intelligence
his
success
was
complete
and
the
extent
of
his
services
to
the
nation
are
not
easily
to
be
exaggerated
he
unearthed
a
really
appalling
amount
of
corruption
and
he
did
his
work
with
such
absolute
thoroughness
that
the
corruption
was
completely
eradicated
we
had
of
course
the
experience
usual
in
all
such
investigations
at
first
there
was
popular
incredulity
and
disbelief
that
there
was
much
behind
the
charges
or
that
much
could
be
unearthed
then
when
the
corruption
was
shown
there
followed
a
yell
of
anger
from
all
directions
and
a
period
during
which
any
man
accused
was
forthwith
held
guilty
by
the
public
and
violent
demands
were
made
by
the
newspapers
for
the
prosecution
not
only
of
the
men
who
could
be
prosecuted
with
a
fair
chance
of
securing
conviction
and
imprisonment
but
of
other
men
whose
misconduct
had
been
such
as
to
warrant
my
removing
them
from
office
but
against
whom
it
was
not
possible
to
get
the
kind
of
evidence
which
would
render
likely
conviction
in
a
criminal
case
suits
were
brought
against
all
the
officials
whom
we
thought
we
could
convict
and
the
public
complained
bitterly
that
we
did
not
bring
further
suits
we
secured
several
convictions
including
convictions
of
the
most
notable
offenders
the
trials
consumed
a
good
deal
of
time
public
attention
was
attracted
to
something
else
indifference
succeeded
to
excitement
and
in
some
subtle
way
the
juries
seemed
to
respond
to
the
indifference
one
of
the
worst
offenders
was
acquitted
by
a
jury
whereupon
not
a
few
of
the
same
men
who
had
insisted
that
the
government
was
derelict
in
not
criminally
prosecuting
every
man
whose
misconduct
was
established
so
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
turn
him
out
of
office
now
turned
round
and
inasmuch
as
the
jury
had
not
found
this
man
guilty
of
crime
demanded
that
he
should
be
reinstated
in
office
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
demand
was
not
granted
there
were
two
or
three
other
acquittals
of
prominent
outsiders
nevertheless
the
net
result
was
that
the
majority
of
the
worst
offenders
were
sent
to
prison
and
the
remainder
dismissed
from
the
government
service
if
they
were
public
officials
and
if
they
were
not
public
officials
at
least
so
advertised
as
to
render
it
impossible
that
they
should
ever
again
have
dealings
with
the
government
the
department
was
absolutely
cleaned
and
became
one
of
the
very
best
in
the
government
several
senators
came
to
me
garfield
was
present
on
the
occasion
and
said
that
they
were
glad
i
was
putting
a
stop
to
corruption
but
they
hoped
i
would
avoid
all
scandal
that
if
i
would
make
an
example
of
some
one
man
and
then
let
the
others
quietly
resign
it
would
avoid
a
disturbance
which
might
hurt
the
party
they
were
advising
me
in
good
faith
and
i
was
as
courteous
as
possible
in
my
answer
but
explained
that
i
would
have
to
act
with
the
utmost
rigor
against
the
offenders
no
matter
what
the
effect
on
the
party
and
moreover
that
i
did
not
believe
it
would
hurt
the
party
it
did
not
hurt
the
party
it
helped
the
party
a
favorite
in
american
political
life
has
always
been
turn
the
rascals
out
we
made
it
evident
that
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
this
was
pointless
for
we
turned
our
own
rascals
out
there
were
important
and
successful
land
fraud
prosecutions
in
several
western
states
probably
the
most
important
were
the
cases
prosecuted
in
oregon
by
francis
heney
with
the
assistance
of
william
burns
a
secret
service
agent
who
at
that
time
began
his
career
as
a
great
detective
it
would
be
impossible
to
overstate
the
services
rendered
to
the
cause
of
decency
and
honesty
by
heney
and
burns
heney
was
my
close
and
intimate
adviser
professionally
and
not
only
as
regards
putting
a
stop
to
frauds
in
the
public
lands
but
in
many
other
matters
of
vital
interest
to
the
republic
no
man
in
the
country
has
waged
the
battle
for
national
honesty
with
greater
courage
and
success
with
more
devotion
to
the
public
good
and
no
man
has
been
more
traduced
and
maligned
by
the
agents
and
representatives
of
the
great
sinister
forces
of
evil
he
secured
the
conviction
of
various
men
of
high
political
and
financial
standing
in
connection
with
the
oregon
prosecutions
he
and
burns
behaved
with
scrupulous
fairness
and
propriety
but
their
services
to
the
public
caused
them
to
incur
the
bitter
hatred
of
those
who
had
wronged
the
public
and
after
i
left
office
the
national
administration
turned
against
them
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
men
whom
they
had
succeeded
in
convicting
was
pardoned
by
president
taft
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
presiding
judge
judge
hunt
had
held
that
the
evidence
amply
warranted
the
conviction
and
had
sentenced
the
man
to
imprisonment
as
was
natural
the
one
hundred
and
defendants
in
oregon
who
included
the
foremost
machine
political
leaders
in
the
state
furnished
the
backbone
of
the
opposition
to
me
in
the
presidential
contest
of
the
opposition
rallied
behind
taft
and
lafollette
and
although
i
carried
the
primaries
handsomely
half
of
the
delegates
elected
from
oregon
under
instructions
to
vote
for
me
sided
with
my
opponents
in
the
national
convention
and
as
regards
some
of
them
i
became
convinced
that
the
mainspring
of
their
motive
lay
in
the
intrigue
for
securing
the
pardon
of
certain
of
the
men
whose
conviction
heney
had
secured
land
fraud
and
cases
were
not
the
only
ones
we
were
especially
zealous
in
prosecuting
all
of
the
higher
up
offenders
in
the
realms
of
politics
and
finance
who
swindled
on
a
large
scale
special
assistants
of
the
such
as
frank
kellogg

and
various

district
attorneys
in
different
parts
of

notable
results

for

in
connection
with
the
prosecution
of
the
sugar
trust
and
of
the
banker

and
of
a
great
metropolitan
newspaper
for
opening
its
columns
to
obscene
and
immoral
advertisements
and
in
louis
dyer
and

among
other
services
secured
the
conviction
and
imprisonment
of
senator

of
kansas
and
in
chicago

who
raised
his
office
to
the
highest
pitch
of
efficiency
secured

conviction
of
the
banker

and
of
the
beef
trust
and
first
broke
through
the
armor
of
the
standard
oil
trust
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
these
men
and
others
like
them
worked
a
complete
revolution
in
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
laws
and
made
their
offices
organized
legal
machines
fit
and
ready
to
conduct
smashing
fights
for
the
rights
and
to
enforce
the
laws
in
aggressive
fashion
when
i
took
the
presidency
it
was
a
common
and
bitter
saying
that
a
big
man
a
rich
man
could
not
be
put
in
jail
we
put
many
big
and
rich
men
in
jail

senators

these
were
merely
individual
cases
among
many
others
like
them
moreover
we
were
just
as
relentless
in
dealing
with
crimes
of
violence
among
the
disorderly
and
brutal
classes
as
in
dealing
with
the
crimes
of
cunning
and
fraud
of
which
certain
wealthy

and
big
politicians
were
guilty
sims

efficient

infamous

when
by

announced

to

international
agreement

suppression

the
views
i
then
held

this
man
committed
the
most
hideous
crime
known
to
our
laws
and
twice
before
he
has
committed
crimes
of
a
similar
though
less
horrible
character
in
my
judgment
there
is
no
justification
whatever
for
paying
heed
to
the
allegations
that
he
is
not
of
sound
mind
allegations
made
after
the
trial
and
conviction
nobody
would
pretend
that
there
has
ever
been
any
such
degree
of
mental
unsoundness
shown
as
would
make
people
even
consider
sending
him
to
an
asylum
if
he
had
not
committed
this
crime
under
such
circumstances
he
should
certainly
be
esteemed
sane
enough
to
suffer
the
penalty
for
his
monstrous
deed
i
have
scant
sympathy
with
the
plea
of
insanity
advanced
to
save
a
man
from
the
consequences
of
crime
when
unless
that
crime
had
been
committed
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
persuade
any
responsible
authority
to
commit
him
to
an
asylum
as
insane
among
the
most
dangerous
criminals
and
especially
among
those
prone
to
commit
this
particular
kind
of
offense
there
are
plenty
of
a
temper
so
fiendish
or
so
brutal
as
to
be
incompatible
with
any
other
than
a
brutish
order
of
intelligence
but
these
men
are
nevertheless
responsible
for
their
acts
and
nothing
more
tends
to
encourage
crime
among
such
men
than
the
belief
that
through
the
plea
of
insanity
or
any
other
method
it
is
possible
for
them
to
escape
paying
the
just
penalty
of
their
crimes
the
crime
in
question
is
one
to
the
existence
of
which
we
largely
owe
the
existence
of
that
spirit
of
lawlessness
which
takes
form
in
lynching
it
is
a
crime
so
revolting
that
the
criminal
is
not
entitled
to
one
particle
of
sympathy
from
any
human
being
it
is
essential
that
the
punishment
for
it
should
be
not
only
as
certain
but
as
swift
as
possible
the
jury
in
this
case
did
their
duty
by
recommending
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
we
do
not
have
special
provision
for
more
summary
dealing
with
this
type
of
case
the
more
we
do
what
in
us
lies
to
secure
certain
and
swift
justice
in
dealing
with
these
cases
the
more
effectively
do
we
work
against
the
growth
of
that
lynching
spirit
which
is
so
full
of
evil
omen
for
this
people
because
it
seeks
to
avenge
one
infamous
crime
by
the
commission
of
another
of
equal
infamy

application
is
denied

roosevelt
one
of
the
most
curious
incidents
of
lawlessness
with
which
i
had
to
deal
affected
an
entire
state
the
state
of
nevada
in
the
year
was
gradually
drifting
into
utter
governmental
impotence
and
downright
anarchy
the
people
were
at
heart
all
right
but
the
forces
of
evil
had
been
permitted
to
get
the
upper
hand
and
for
the
time
being
the
decent
citizens
had
become
helpless
to
assert
themselves
either
by
controlling
the
greedy
corporations
on
the
one
hand
or
repressing
the
murderous
violence
of
certain
lawless
labor
organizations
on
the
other
hand
the
governor
of
the
state
was
a
democrat
and
a
southern
man
and
in
the
abstract
a
strong
believer
in
the
doctrine
of
state
rights
but
his
experience
finally
convinced
him
that
he
could
obtain
order
only
through
the
intervention
of
the
national
government
and
then
he
went
over
too
far

to
have

do
his

work
for
him

the
rocky
mountain
states
there
had
existed
for
years
what
was
practically
a
condition
of
almost
constant
war
between
the
wealthy
and
the
western
federation
of
miners
at
whose
head
stood
haywood
pettibone
and
moyer
who
were
about
that
time
indicted
for
the
murder
of
the
governor
of
idaho
much
that
was
lawless
much
that
was
indefensible
had
been
done
by
both
sides
the
legislature
of
nevada
was
in
sympathy
with
or
at
least
was
afraid
of
not
expressing
sympathy
for
moyer
haywood
pettibone
and
their
associates
the
state
was
practically
without
any
police
and
the
governor
had
recommended
the
establishment
of
a
state
constabulary
along
the
lines
of
the
texas
rangers
but
the
legislature
rejected
his
request
the
governor
reported
to
me
the
conditions
as
follows
during
the
goldfield
mining
district
became
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
half
of
the
western
federation
of
miners
were
constantly
armed
and
arms
and
ammunition
were
purchased
and
kept
by
the
union
as
a
body
while
the
on
their
side
retained
large
numbers
of
watchmen
and
guards
who
were
also
armed
and
always
on
duty
in
addition
to
these
opposing
forces
there
was
as
the
governor
reported
an
unusually
large
number
of
the
violent
and
criminal
element
always
attracted
to
a
new
and
booming
mining
camp
under
such
conditions
the
civil
authorities
were
practically
powerless
and
the
governor
being
helpless
to
avert
civil
war
called
on
me
to
keep
order
i
accordingly
threw
in
a
body
of
regular
troops
under
general
funston
these
kept
order
completely
and
the
governor
became
so
well
satisfied
that
he
thought
he
would
like
to
have
them
there
permanently
this
seemed
to
me
unhealthy
and
on
december
i
notified
him
that
while
i
would
do
my
duty
the
first
need
was
that
the
state
authorities
should
do
theirs
and
that
the
first
step
towards
this
was
the
assembling
of
the
legislature
i
concluded
my
telegram
if
within
five
days
from
receipt
of
this
telegram
you
shall
have
issued
the
necessary
notice
to
convene
the
legislature
of
nevada
i
shall
continue
the
troops
during
a
period
of
three
weeks
if
when
the
term
of
five
days
has
elapsed
the
notice
has
not
been
issued
the
troops
will
be
immediately
returned
to
their
former
stations
i
had
already
investigated
the
situation
through
a
committee
composed
of
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
smith
the
chief
of
the
bureau
of
labor
neill
and
the
comptroller
of
the
treasury
lawrence
murray
these
men
i
could
thoroughly
trust
and
their
report
which
was
not
to
either
side
had
convinced
me
that
the
only
permanent
way
to
get
good
results
was
to
insist
on
the
people
of
the
state
themselves
grappling
with
and
solving
their
own
troubles
the
governor
summoned
the
legislature
it
met
and
the
constabulary
bill
was
passed
the
troops
remained
in
nevada
until
time
had
been
given
for
the
state
authorities
to
organize
their
force
so
that
violence
could
at
once
be
checked
then
they
were
withdrawn
nor
was
it
only
as
regards
their
own
internal
affairs
that
i
sometimes
had
to
get
into
active
communication
with
the
state
authorities
there
has
always
been
a
strong
feeling
in
california
against
the
immigration
of
asiatic
laborers
whether
these
are
or
men
who
occupy
and
till
the
soil
i
believe
this
to
be
fundamentally
a
sound
and
proper
attitude
an
attitude
which
must
be
insisted
upon
and
yet
which
can
be
insisted
upon
in
such
a
manner
and
with
such
courtesy
and
such
sense
of
mutual
fairness
and
reciprocal
obligation
and
respect
as
not
to
give
any
just
cause
of
offense
to
asiatic
peoples
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
progress
it
is
highly
inadvisable
that
peoples
in
wholly
different
stages
of
civilization
or
of
wholly
different
types
of
civilization
even
although
both
equally
high
shall
be
thrown
into
intimate
contact
this
is
especially
undesirable
when
there
is
a
difference
of
both
race
and
standard
of
living
in
california
the
question
became
acute
in
connection
with
the
admission
of
the
japanese
i
then
had
and
now
have
a
hearty
admiration
for
the
japanese
people
i
believe
in
them
i
respect
their
great
qualities
i
wish
that
our
american
people
had
many
of
these
qualities
japanese
and
american
students
travelers
scientific
and
literary
men
merchants
engaged
in
international
trade
and
the
like
can
meet
on
terms
of
entire
equality
and
should
be
given
the
freest
access
each
to
the
country
of
the
other
but
the
japanese
themselves
would
not
tolerate
the
intrusion
into
their
country
of
a
mass
of
americans
who
would
displace
japanese
in
the
business
of
the
land
i
think
they
are
entirely
right
in
this
position
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
japan
has
the
absolute
right
to
declare
on
what
terms
foreigners
shall
be
admitted
to
work
in
her
country
or
to
own
land
in
her
country
or
to
become
citizens
of
her
country
america
has
and
must
insist
upon
the
same
right
the
people
of
california
were
right
in
insisting
that
the
japanese
should
not
come
thither
in
mass
that
there
should
be
no
influx
of
laborers
of
agricultural
workers
or
small
tradesmen
in
short
no
mass
settlement
or
immigration
unfortunately
during
the
latter
part
of
my
term
as
president
certain
unwise
and
demagogic
agitators
in
california
to
show
their
disapproval
of
the
japanese
coming
into
the
state
adopted
the
very
foolish
procedure
of
trying
to
provide
by
law
that
the
japanese
children
should
not
be
allowed
to
attend
the
schools
with
the
white
children
and
offensive
and
injurious
language
was
used
in
connection
with
the
proposal
the
federal
administration
promptly
took
up
the
matter
with
the
california
authorities
and
i
got
into
personal
touch
with
them
at
my
request
the
mayor
of
san
francisco
and
other
leaders
in
the
movement
came
on
to
see
me
i
explained
that
the
duty
of
the
national
government
was
twofold
in
the
first
place
to
meet
every
reasonable
wish
and
every
real
need
of
the
people
of
california
or
any
other
state
in
dealing
with
the
people
of
a
foreign
power
and
in
the
next
place
itself
exclusively
and
fully
to
exercise
the
right
of
dealing
with
this
foreign
power
inasmuch
as
in
the
last
resort
including
that
last
of
all
resorts
war
the
dealing
of
necessity
had
to
be
between
the
foreign
power
and
the
national
government
it
was
impossible
to
admit
that
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
could
be
invoked
in
such
a
matter
as
soon
as
legislative
or
other
action
in
any
state
affects
a
foreign
nation
then
the
affair
becomes
one
for
the
nation
and
the
state
should
deal
with
the
foreign
power
purely
through
the
nation
i
explained
that
i
was
in
entire
sympathy
with
the
people
of
california
as
to
the
subject
of
immigration
of
the
japanese
in
mass
but
that
of
course
i
wished
to
accomplish
the
object
they
had
in
view
in
the
way
that
would
be
most
courteous
and
most
agreeable
to
the
feelings
of
the
japanese
that
all
relations
between
the
two
peoples
must
be
those
of
reciprocal
justice
and
that
it
was
an
intolerable
outrage
on
the
part
of
newspapers
and
public
men
to
use
offensive
and
insulting
language
about
a
sensitive
and
friendly
people
and
that
such
action
as
was
proposed
about
the
schools
could
only
have
bad
effects
and
would
in
no
shape
or
way
achieve
the
purpose
that
the
californians
had
in
mind
i
also
explained
that
i
would
use
every
resource
of
the
national
government
to
protect
the
japanese
in
their
treaty
rights
and
would
count
upon
the
state
authorities
backing
me
up
to
the
limit
in
such
action
in
short
i
insisted
upon
the
two
points
that
the
nation
and
not
the
individual
states
must
deal
with
matters
of
such
international
significance
and
must
treat
foreign
nations
with
entire
courtesy
and
respect
and
that
the
nation
would
at
once
and
in
efficient
and
satisfactory
manner
take
action
that
would
meet
the
needs
of
california
i
both
asserted
the
power
of
the
nation
and
offered
a
full
remedy
for
the
needs
of
the
state
this
is
the
right
and
the
only
right
course
the
worst
possible
course
in
such
a
case
is
to
fail
to
insist
on
the
right
of
the
nation
to
offer
no
action
of
the
nation
to
remedy
what
is
wrong
and
yet
to
try
to
coax
the
state
not
to
do
what
it
is
mistakenly
encouraged
to
believe
it
has
the
power
to
do
when
no
other
alternative
is
offered
after
a
good
deal
of
discussion
we
came
to
an
entirely
satisfactory
conclusion
the
obnoxious
school
legislation
was
abandoned
and
i
secured
an
arrangement
with
japan
under
which
the
japanese
themselves
prevented
any
immigration
to
our
country
of
their
laboring
people
it
being
distinctly
understood
that
if
there
was
such
emigration
the
united
states
would
at
once
pass
an
exclusion
law
it
was
of
course
infinitely
better
that
the
japanese
should
stop
their
own
people
from
coming
rather
than
that
we
should
have
to
stop
them
but
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
hold
this
power
in
reserve
unfortunately
after
i
left
office
a
most
mistaken
and
policy
was
pursued
towards
japan
combining
irritation
and
inefficiency
which
culminated
in
a
treaty
under
which
we
surrendered
this
important
and
necessary
right
it
was
alleged
in
excuse
that
the
treaty
provided
for
its
own
abrogation
but
of
course
it
is
infinitely
better
to
have
a
treaty
under
which
the
power
to
exercise
a
necessary
right
is
explicitly
retained
rather
than
a
treaty
so
drawn
that
recourse
must
be
had
to
the
extreme
step
of
abrogating
if
it
ever
becomes
necessary
to
exercise
the
right
in
question
the
arrangement
we
made
worked
admirably
and
entirely
achieved
its
purpose
no
small
part
of
our
success
was
due
to
the
fact
that
we
succeeded
in
impressing
on
the
japanese
that
we
sincerely
admired
and
respected
them
and
desired
to
treat
them
with
the
utmost
consideration
i
can
not
too
strongly
express
my
indignation
with
and
abhorrence
of
reckless
public
writers
and
speakers
who
with
coarse
and
vulgar
insolence
insult
the
japanese
people
and
thereby
do
the
greatest
wrong
not
only
to
japan
but
to
their
own
country
such
conduct
represents
that
nadir
of
underbreeding
and
folly
the
japanese
are
one
of
the
great
nations
of
the
world
entitled
to
stand
and
standing
on
a
footing
of
full
equality
with
any
nation
of
europe
or
america
i
have
the
heartiest
admiration
for
them
they
can
teach
us
much
their
civilization
is
in
some
respects
higher
than
our
own
it
is
eminently
undesirable
that
japanese
and
americans
should
attempt
to
live
together
in
masses
any
such
attempt
would
be
sure
to
result
disastrously
and
the
statesmen
of
both
countries
should
join
to
prevent
it
but
this
is
not
because
either
nation
is
inferior
to
the
other
it
is
because
they
are
different
the
two
peoples
represent
two
civilizations
which
although
in
many
respects
equally
high
are
so
totally
distinct
in
their
past
history
that
it
is
idle
to
expect
in
one
or
two
generations
to
overcome
this
difference
one
civilization
is
as
old
as
the
other
and
in
neither
case
is
the
line
of
cultural
descent
coincident
with
that
of
ethnic
descent
unquestionably
the
ancestors
of
the
great
majority
both
of
the
modern
americans
and
the
modern
japanese
were
barbarians
in
that
remote
past
which
saw
the
origins
of
the
cultured
peoples
to
which
the
americans
and
the
japanese
of
severally
trace
their
civilizations
but
the
lines
of
development
of
these
two
civilizations
of
the
orient
and
the
occident
have
been
separate
and
divergent
since
thousands
of
years
before
the
christian
era
certainly
since
that
hoary
eld
in
which
the
akkadian
predecessors
of
the
chaldean
semites
held
sway
in
mesopotamia
an
effort
to
mix
together
out
of
hand
the
peoples
representing
the
culminating
points
of
two
such
lines
of
divergent
cultural
development
would
be
fraught
with
peril
and
this
i
repeat
because
the
two
are
different
not
because
either
is
inferior
to
the
other
wise
statesmen
looking
to
the
future
will
for
the
present
endeavor
to
keep
the
two
nations
from
mass
contact
and
intermingling
precisely
because
they
wish
to
keep
each
in
relations
of
permanent
good
will
and
friendship
with
the
other
exactly
what
was
done
in
the
particular
crisis
to
which
i
refer
is
shown
in
the
following
letter
which
after
our
policy
had
been
successfully
put
into
execution
i
sent
to
the
then
speaker
of
the
california
lower
house
of
the
legislature
the
white
house
washington
february
hon
stanton
speaker
of
the
assembly
sacramento
california
i
trust
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding
of
the
federal
attitude
we
are
jealously
endeavoring
to
guard
the
interests
of
california
and
of
the
entire
west
in
accordance
with
the
desires
of
our
western
people
by
friendly
agreement
with
japan
we
are
now
carrying
out
a
policy
which
while
meeting
the
interests
and
desires
of
the
pacific
slope
is
yet
compatible
not
merely
with
mutual
but
with
mutual
esteem
and
admiration
between
the
americans
and
japanese
the
japanese
government
is
loyally
and
in
good
faith
doing
its
part
to
carry
out
this
policy
precisely
as
the
american
government
is
doing
the
policy
aims
at
mutuality
of
obligation
and
behavior
in
accordance
with
it
the
purpose
is
that
the
japanese
shall
come
here
exactly
as
americans
go
to
japan
which
is
in
effect
that
travelers
students
persons
engaged
in
international
business
men
who
sojourn
for
pleasure
or
study
and
the
like
shall
have
the
freest
access
from
one
country
to
the
other
and
shall
be
sure
of
the
best
treatment
but
that
there
shall
be
no
settlement
in
mass
by
the
people
of
either
country
in
the
other
during
the
last
six
months
under
this
policy
more
japanese
have
left
the
country
than
have
come
in
and
the
total
number
in
the
united
states
has
diminished
by
over
two
thousand
these
figures
are
absolutely
accurate
and
can
not
be
impeached
in
other
words
if
the
present
policy
is
consistently
followed
and
works
as
well
in
the
future
as
it
is
now
working
all
difficulties
and
causes
of
friction
will
disappear
while
at
the
same
time
each
nation
will
retain
its
and
the
good
will
of
the
other
but
such
a
bill
as
this
school
bill
accomplishes
literally
nothing
whatever
in
the
line
of
the
object
aimed
at
and
gives
just
and
grave
cause
for
irritation
while
in
addition
the
united
states
government
would
be
obliged
immediately
to
take
action
in
the
federal
courts
to
test
such
legislation
as
we
hold
it
to
be
clearly
a
violation
of
the
treaty
on
this
point
i
refer
you
to
the
numerous
decisions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
regard
to
state
laws
which
violate
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states
the
legislation
would
accomplish
nothing
beneficial
and
would
certainly
cause
some
mischief
and
might
cause
very
grave
mischief
in
short
the
policy
of
the
administration
is
to
combine
the
maximum
of
efficiency
in
achieving
the
real
object
which
the
people
of
the
pacific
slope
have
at
heart
with
the
minimum
of
friction
and
trouble
while
the
misguided
men
who
advocate
such
action
as
this
against
which
i
protest
are
following
a
policy
which
combines
the
very
minimum
of
efficiency
with
the
maximum
of
insult
and
which
while
totally
failing
to
achieve
any
real
result
for
good
yet
might
accomplish
an
infinity
of
harm
if
in
the
next
year
or
two
the
action
of
the
federal
government
fails
to
achieve
what
it
is
now
achieving
then
through
the
further
action
of
the
president
and
congress
it
can
be
made
entirely
efficient
i
am
sure
that
the
sound
judgment
of
the
people
of
california
will
support
you
speaker
in
your
effort
let
me
repeat
that
at
present
we
are
actually
doing
the
very
thing
which
the
people
of
california
wish
to
be
done
and
to
upset
the
arrangement
under
which
this
is
being
done
can
not
do
good
and
may
do
great
harm
if
in
the
next
year
or
two
the
figures
of
immigration
prove
that
the
arrangement
which
has
worked
so
successfully
during
the
last
six
months
is
no
longer
working
successfully
then
there
would
be
ground
for
grievance
and
for
the
reversal
by
the
national
government
of
its
present
policy
but
at
present
the
policy
is
working
well
and
until
it
works
badly
it
would
be
a
grave
misfortune
to
change
it
and
when
changed
it
can
only
be
changed
effectively
by
the
national
government
theodore
roosevelt
in
foreign
and
domestic
affairs
alike
the
policy
pursued
during
my
administration
was
simple
in
foreign
affairs
the
principle
from
which
we
never
deviated
was
to
have
the
nation
behave
toward
other
nations
precisely
as
a
strong
honorable
and
upright
man
behaves
in
dealing
with
his
there
is
no
such
thing
as
international
law
in
the
sense
that
there
is
municipal
law
or
law
within
a
nation
within
the
nation
there
is
always
a
judge
and
a
policeman
who
stands
back
of
the
judge
the
whole
system
of
law
depends
first
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
judge
competent
to
pass
judgment
and
second
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
some
competent
officer
whose
duty
it
is
to
carry
out
this
judgment
by
force
if
necessary
in
international
law
there
is
no
judge
unless
the
parties
in
interest
agree
that
one
shall
be
constituted
and
there
is
no
policeman
to
carry
out
the
judge
orders
in
consequence
as
yet
each
nation
must
depend
upon
itself
for
its
own
protection
the
frightful
calamities
that
have
befallen
china
solely
because
she
has
had
no
power
of
ought
to
make
it
inexcusable
in
any
wise
american
citizen
to
pretend
to
patriotic
purpose
and
yet
to
fail
to
insist
that
the
united
states
shall
keep
in
a
condition
of
ability
if
necessary
to
assert
its
rights
with
a
strong
hand
it
is
folly
of
the
criminal
type
for
the
nation
not
to
keep
up
its
navy
not
to
fortify
its
vital
strategic
points
and
not
to
provide
an
adequate
army
for
its
needs
on
the
other
hand
it
is
wicked
for
the
nation
to
fail
in
either
justice
courtesy
or
consideration
when
dealing
with
any
other

john
hay
was
secretary
of
state
when
i
became
president
and
continued
to
serve
under
me
until
his
death
and
his
and
my
views
as
to
the
attitude
that
the
nation
should
take
in
foreign
affairs
were
identical
both
as
regards
our
duty
to
be
able
to
protect
ourselves
against
the
strong
and
as
regards
our
duty
always
to
act
not
only
justly
but
generously
toward
the
weak
john
hay
was
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
companions
one
of
the
most
charming
of
all
men
of
cultivation
and
action
our
views
on
foreign
affairs
coincided
absolutely
but
as
was
natural
enough
in
domestic
matters
he
felt
much
more
conservative
than
he
did
in
the
days
when
as
a
young
man
he
was
private
secretary
to
the
great
radical
democratic
leader
of
the
abraham
lincoln
he
was
fond
of
jesting
with
me
about
my
supposedly
dangerous
tendencies
in
favor
of
labor
against
capital
when
i
was
inaugurated
on
march
i
wore
a
ring
he
sent
me
the
evening
before
containing
the
hair
of
abraham
lincoln
this
ring
was
on
my
finger
when
the
chief
justice
administered
to
me
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
i
often
thereafter
told
john
hay
that
when
i
wore
such
a
ring
on
such
an
occasion
i
bound
myself
more
than
ever
to
treat
the
constitution
after
the
manner
of
abraham
lincoln
as
a
document
which
put
human
rights
above
property
rights
when
the
two
conflicted
the
last
christmas
john
hay
was
alive
he
sent
me
the
manuscript
of
a
norse
saga
by
william
morris
with
the
following
note
christmas
eve
dear
theodore
in
your
quality
of
viking
this
norse
saga
should
belong
to
you
and
in
your
character
of
enemy
of
property
this
of
william
morris
will
appeal
to
you
wishing
you
a
merry
christmas
and
many
happy
years
i
am
yours
affectionately
john
hay
in
internal
affairs
i
can
not
say
that
i
entered
the
presidency
with
any
deliberately
planned
and
scheme
of
social
betterment
i
had
however
certain
strong
convictions
and
i
was
on
the
lookout
for
every
opportunity
of
realizing
those
convictions
i
was
bent
upon
making
the
government
the
most
efficient
possible
instrument
in
helping
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
better
themselves
in
every
way
politically
socially
and
industrially
i
believed
with
all
my
heart
in
real
and
thoroughgoing
democracy
and
i
wished
to
make
this
democracy
industrial
as
well
as
political
although
i
had
only
partially
formulated
the
methods
i
believed
we
should
follow
i
believed
in
the
people
rights
and
therefore
in
national
rights
and
states
rights
just
exactly
to
the
degree
in
which
they
severally
secured
popular
rights
i
believed
in
invoking
the
national
power
with
absolute
freedom
for
every
national
need
and
i
believed
that
the
constitution
should
be
treated
as
the
greatest
document
ever
devised
by
the
wit
of
man
to
aid
a
people
in
exercising
every
power
necessary
for
its
own
betterment
and
not
as
a
straitjacket
cunningly
fashioned
to
strangle
growth
as
for
the
particular
methods
of
realizing
these
various
beliefs
i
was
content
to
wait
and
see
what
method
might
be
necessary
in
each
given
case
as
it
arose
and
i
was
certain
that
the
cases
would
arise
fast
enough
as
the
time
for
the
presidential
nomination
of
drew
near
it
became
evident
that
i
was
strong
with
the
rank
and
file
of
the
party
but
that
there
was
much
opposition
to
me
among
many
of
the
big
political
leaders
and
especially
among
many
of
the
wall
street
men
a
group
of
these
men
met
in
conference
to
organize
this
opposition
it
was
to
be
done
with
complete
secrecy
but
such
secrets
are
very
hard
to
keep
i
speedily
knew
all
about
it
and
took
my
measures
accordingly
the
big
men
in
question
who
possessed
much
power
so
long
as
they
could
work
under
cover
or
so
long
as
they
were
merely
throwing
their
weight
one
way
or
the
other
between
forces
fairly
evenly
balanced
were
quite
helpless
when
fighting
in
the
open
by
themselves
i
never
found
out
that
anything
practical
was
even
attempted
by
most
of
the
men
who
took
part
in
the
conference
three
or
four
of
them
however
did
attempt
something
the
head
of
one
big
business
corporation
attempted
to
start
an
effort
to
control
the
delegations
from
new
jersey
north
carolina
and
certain
gulf
states
against
me
the
head
of
a
great
railway
system
made
preparations
for
a
more
ambitious
effort
looking
towards
the
control
of
the
delegations
from
iowa
kansas
nebraska
colorado
and
california
against
me
he
was
a
very
powerful
man
financially
but
his
power
politically
was
much
more
limited
and
he
did
not
really
understand
his
own
limitations
or
the
situation
itself
whereas
i
did
he
could
not
have
secured
a
delegate
against
me
from
iowa
nebraska
or
kansas
in
colorado
and
california
he
could
have
made
a
fight
but
even
there
i
think
he
would
have
been
completely
beaten
however
long
before
the
time
for
the
convention
came
around
it
was
recognized
that
it
was
hopeless
to
make
any
opposition
to
my
nomination
the
effort
was
abandoned
and
i
was
nominated
unanimously
judge
parker
was
nominated
by
the
democrats
against
me
practically
all
the
metropolitan
newspapers
of
largest
circulation
were
against
me
in
new
york
city
fifteen
out
of
every
sixteen
copies
of
papers
issued
were
hostile
to
me
i
won
by
a
popular
majority
of
about
two
million
and
a
half
and
in
the
electoral
college
carried
votes
against
it
was
by
far
the
largest
popular
majority
ever
hitherto
given
any
presidential
candidate
my
opponents
during
the
campaign
had
laid
much
stress
upon
my
supposed
personal
ambition
and
intention
to
use
the
office
of
president
to
perpetuate
myself
in
power
i
did
not
say
anything
on
the
subject
prior
to
the
election
as
i
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
that
could
be
construed
into
a
promise
offered
as
a
consideration
in
order
to
secure
votes
but
on
election
night
after
the
returns
were
in
i
issued
the
following
statement
the
wise
custom
which
limits
the
president
to
two
terms
regards
the
substance
and
not
the
form
and
under
no
circumstances
will
i
be
a
candidate
for
or
accept
another
nomination
the
reason
for
my
choice
of
the
exact
phraseology
used
was
twofold
in
the
first
place
many
of
my
supporters
were
insisting
that
as
i
had
served
only
three
and
a
half
years
of
my
first
term
coming
in
from
the
when
president
mckinley
was
killed
i
had
really
had
only
one
elective
term
so
that
the
third
term
custom
did
not
apply
to
me
and
i
wished
to
repudiate
this
suggestion
i
believed
then
and
i
believe
now
the
third
term
custom
or
tradition
to
be
wholesome
and
therefore
i
was
determined
to
regard
its
substance
refusing
to
quibble
over
the
words
usually
employed
to
express
it
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
wish
simply
and
specifically
to
say
that
i
would
not
be
a
candidate
for
the
nomination
in
because
if
i
had
specified
the
year
when
i
would
not
be
a
candidate
it
would
have
been
widely
accepted
as
meaning
that
i
intended
to
be
a
candidate
some
other
year
and
i
had
no
such
intention
and
had
no
idea
that
i
would
ever
be
a
candidate
again
certain
newspaper
men
did
ask
me
if
i
intended
to
apply
my
prohibition
to
and
i
answered
that
i
was
not
thinking
of
nor
of
nor
of
and
that
i
must
decline
to
say
anything
whatever
except
what
appeared
in
my
statement
the
presidency
is
a
great
office
and
the
power
of
the
president
can
be
effectively
used
to
secure
a
renomination
especially
if
the
president
has
the
support
of
certain
great
political
and
financial
interests
it
is
for
this
reason
and
this
reason
alone
that
the
wholesome
principle
of
continuing
in
office
so
long
as
he
is
willing
to
serve
an
incumbent
who
has
proved
capable
is
not
applicable
to
the
presidency
therefore
the
american
people
have
wisely
established
a
custom
against
allowing
any
man
to
hold
that
office
for
more
than
two
consecutive
terms
but
every
shred
of
power
which
a
president
exercises
while
in
office
vanishes
absolutely
when
he
has
once
left
office
an
stands
precisely
in
the
position
of
any
other
private
citizen
and
has
not
one
particle
more
power
to
secure
a
nomination
or
election
than
if
he
had
never
held
the
office
at
all
indeed
he
probably
has
less
because
of
the
very
fact
that
he
has
held
the
office
therefore
the
reasoning
on
which
the
term
custom
is
based
has
no
application
whatever
to
an
and
no
application
whatever
to
anything
except
consecutive
terms
as
a
barrier
of
precaution
against
more
than
two
consecutive
terms
the
custom
embodies
a
valuable
principle
applied
in
any
other
way
it
becomes
a
mere
formula
and
like
all
formulas
a
potential
source
of
mischievous
confusion
having
this
in
mind
i
regarded
the
custom
as
applying
practically
if
not
just
as
much
to
a
president
who
had
been
seven
and
a
half
years
in
office
as
to
one
who
had
been
eight
years
in
office
and
therefore
in
the
teeth
of
a
practically
unanimous
demand
from
my
own
party
that
i
accept
another
nomination
and
the
reasonable
certainty
that
the
nomination
would
be
ratified
at
the
polls
i
felt
that
the
substance
of
the
custom
applied
to
me
in
on
the
other
hand
it
had
no
application
whatever
to
any
human
being
save
where
it
was
invoked
in
the
case
of
a
man
desiring
a
third
consecutive
term
having
given
such
substantial
proof
of
my
own
regard
for
the
custom
i
deem
it
a
duty
to
add
this
comment
on
it
i
believe
that
it
is
well
to
have
a
custom
of
this
kind
to
be
generally
observed
but
that
it
would
be
very
unwise
to
have
it
definitely
hardened
into
a
constitutional
prohibition
it
is
not
desirable
ordinarily
that
a
man
should
stay
in
office
twelve
consecutive
years
as
president
but
most
certainly
the
american
people
are
fit
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
stand
in
no
need
of
an
irrevocable
ordinance
they
should
not
bind
themselves
never
to
take
action
which
under
some
quite
conceivable
circumstances
it
might
be
to
their
great
interest
to
take
it
is
obviously
of
the
last
importance
to
the
safety
of
a
democracy
that
in
time
of
real
peril
it
should
be
able
to
command
the
service
of
every
one
among
its
citizens
in
the
precise
position
where
the
service
rendered
will
be
most
valuable
it
would
be
a
benighted
policy
in
such
event
to
disqualify
absolutely
from
the
highest
office
a
man
who
while
holding
it
had
actually
shown
the
highest
capacity
to
exercise
its
powers
with
the
utmost
effect
for
the
public
defense
if
for
instance
a
tremendous
crisis
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
second
term
of
a
man
like
lincoln
as
such
a
crisis
occurred
at
the
end
of
his
first
term
it
would
be
a
veritable
calamity
if
the
american
people
were
forbidden
to
continue
to
use
the
services
of
the
one
man
whom
they
knew
and
did
not
merely
guess
could
carry
them
through
the
crisis
the
third
term
tradition
has
no
value
whatever
except
as
it
applies
to
a
third
consecutive
term
while
it
is
well
to
keep
it
as
a
custom
it
would
be
a
mark
both
of
weakness
and
unwisdom
for
the
american
people
to
embody
it
into
a
constitutional
provision
which
could
not
do
them
good
and
on
some
given
occasion
might
work
real
harm
there
was
one
cartoon
made
while
i
was
president
in
which
i
appeared
incidentally
that
was
always
a
great
favorite
of
mine
it
pictured
an
old
fellow
with
chin
whiskers
a
farmer
in
his
with
his
boots
off
sitting
before
the
fire
reading
the
president
message
on
his
feet
were
stockings
of
the
kind
i
have
seen
hung
up
by
the
dozen
in
joe
ferris
store
at
medora
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
come
in
to
town
and
sleep
in
one
of
the
rooms
over
the
store
the
title
of
the
picture
was
his
favorite
author
this
was
the
old
fellow
whom
i
always
used
to
keep
in
mind
he
had
probably
been
in
the
civil
war
in
his
youth
he
had
worked
hard
ever
since
he
left
the
army
he
had
been
a
good
husband
and
father
he
had
brought
up
his
boys
and
girls
to
work
he
did
not
wish
to
do
injustice
to
any
one
else
but
he
wanted
justice
done
to
himself
and
to
others
like
him
and
i
was
bound
to
secure
that
justice
for
him
if
it
lay
in
my
power
to
do
so
i
believe
i
realized
fairly
well
this
ambition
i
shall
turn
to
my
enemies
to
attest
the
truth
of
this
statement
the
new
york
shortly
before
the
national
convention
of
spoke
of
me
as
follows
president
roosevelt
holds
that
his
nomination
by
the
national
republican
convention
of
is
an
assured
thing
he
makes
no
concealment
of
his
conviction
and
it
is
unreservedly
shared
by
his
friends
we
think
president
roosevelt
is
right
there
are
strong
and
convincing
reasons
why
the
president
should
feel
that
success
is
within
his
grasp
he
has
used
the
opportunities
that
he
found
or
created
and
he
has
used
them
with
consummate
skill
and
undeniable
success
the
president
has
disarmed
all
his
enemies
every
weapon
they
had
new
or
old
has
been
taken
from
them
and
added
to
the
now
unassailable
roosevelt
arsenal
why
should
people
wonder
that
bryan
clings
to
silver
has
not
roosevelt
absorbed
and
sequestered
every
vestige
of
the
kansas
city
platform
that
had
a
shred
of
practical
value
suppose
that
bryan
had
been
elected
president
what
could
he
have
accomplished
compared
with
what
roosevelt
has
accomplished
will
his
most
passionate
followers
pretend
for
one
moment
that
bryan
could
have
conceived
much
less
enforced
any
such
pursuit
of
the
trusts
as
that
which
roosevelt
has
just
brought
to
a
triumphant
issue
will
bryan
himself
intimate
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
turned
to
his
projects
the
friendly
countenance
which
they
have
lent
to
those
of
roosevelt
where
is
by
injunction
gone
to
the
very
emptiness
of
that
once
potent
phrase
is
beyond
description
a
regiment
of
bryans
could
not
compete
with
roosevelt
in
harrying
the
trusts
in
bringing
wealth
to
its
knees
and
in
converting
into
the
palpable
actualities
of
action
the
wildest
dreams
of
bryan
campaign
orators
he
has
outdone
them
all
and
how
utterly
the
president
has
routed
the
pretensions
of
bryan
and
of
the
whole
democratic
horde
in
respect
to
organized
labor
how
empty
were
all
their
professions
their
mouthings
and
their
howlings
in
the
face
of
the
simple
and
unpretentious
achievements
of
the
president
in
his
own
straightforward
fashion
he
inflicted
upon
capital
in
one
short
hour
of
the
coal
strike
a
greater
humiliation
than
bryan
could
have
visited
upon
it
in
a
century
he
is
the
leader
of
the
labor
unions
of
the
united
states
roosevelt
has
put
them
above
the
law
and
above
the
constitution
because
for
him
they
are
the
american
people
this
last
i
need
hardly
say
is
merely
a
rhetorical
method
of
saying
that
i
gave
the
labor
union
precisely
the
same
treatment
as
the
corporation
senator
la
follette
in
the
issue
of
his
magazine
immediately
following
my
leaving
the
presidency
in
march
wrote
as
follows
roosevelt
steps
from
the
stage
gracefully
he
has
ruled
his
party
to
a
large
extent
against
its
will
he
has
played
a
large
part
in
the
world
work
for
the
past
seven
years
the
activities
of
his
remarkably
forceful
personality
have
been
so
manifold
that
it
will
be
long
before
his
true
rating
will
be
fixed
in
the
opinion
of
the
race
he
is
said
to
think
that
the
three
great
things
done
by
him
are
the
undertaking
of
the
construction
of
the
panama
canal
and
its
rapid
and
successful
carrying
forward
the
making
of
peace
between
russia
and
japan
and
the
sending
around
the
world
of
the
fleet
these
are
important
things
but
many
will
be
slow
to
think
them
his
greatest
services
the
panama
canal
will
surely
serve
mankind
when
in
operation
and
the
manner
of
organizing
this
work
seems
to
be
fine
but
no
one
can
say
whether
this
project
will
be
a
gigantic
success
or
a
gigantic
failure
and
the
task
is
one
which
must
in
the
nature
of
things
have
been
undertaken
and
carried
through
some
time
soon
as
historic
periods
go
anyhow
the
peace
of
portsmouth
was
a
great
thing
to
be
responsible
for
and
roosevelt
good
offices
undoubtedly
saved
a
great
and
bloody
battle
in
manchuria
but
the
war
was
fought
out
and
the
parties
ready
to
quit
and
there
is
reason
to
think
that
it
was
only
when
this
situation
was
arrived
at
that
the
good
offices
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
were
more
or
less
indirectly
invited
the
fleet
cruise
was
a
strong
piece
of
diplomacy
by
which
we
informed
japan
that
we
will
send
our
fleet
wherever
we
please
and
whenever
we
please
it
worked
out
well
but
none
of
these
things
it
will
seem
to
many
can
compare
with
some
of
roosevelt
other
achievements
perhaps
he
is
loath
to
take
credit
as
a
reformer
for
he
is
prone
to
spell
the
word
with
question
marks
and
to
speak
disparagingly
of
but
for
all
that
this
contemner
of
made
reform
respectable
in
the
united
states
and
this
rebuker
of
has
been
the
chief
agent
in
making
the
history
of
in
the
united
states
a
national
one
conceded
to
be
useful
he
has
preached
from
the
white
house
many
doctrines
but
among
them
he
has
left
impressed
on
the
american
mind
the
one
great
truth
of
economic
justice
couched
in
the
pithy
and
stinging
phrase
square
deal
the
task
of
making
reform
respectable
in
a
commercialized
world
and
of
giving
the
nation
a
slogan
in
a
phrase
is
greater
than
the
man
who
performed
it
is
likely
to
think
and
then
there
is
the
great
and
statesmanlike
movement
for
the
conservation
of
our
national
resources
into
which
roosevelt
so
energetically
threw
himself
at
a
time
when
the
nation
as
a
whole
knew
not
that
we
are
ruining
and
bankrupting
ourselves
as
fast
as
we
can
this
is
probably
the
greatest
thing
roosevelt
did
undoubtedly
this
globe
is
the
capital
stock
of
the
race
it
is
just
so
much
coal
and
oil
and
gas
this
may
be
economized
or
wasted
the
same
thing
is
true
of
phosphates
and
other
mineral
resources
our
water
resources
are
immense
and
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
use
them
our
forests
have
been
destroyed
they
must
be
restored
our
soils
are
being
depleted
they
must
be
built
up
and
conserved
these
questions
are
not
of
this
day
only
or
of
this
generation
they
belong
all
to
the
future
their
consideration
requires
that
high
moral
tone
which
regards
the
earth
as
the
home
of
a
posterity
to
whom
we
owe
a
sacred
duty
this
immense
idea
roosevelt
with
high
statesmanship
dinned
into
the
ears
of
the
nation
until
the
nation
heeded
he
held
it
so
high
that
it
attracted
the
attention
of
the
neighboring
nations
of
the
continent
and
will
so
spread
and
intensify
that
we
will
soon
see
the
conferences
devoted
to
it
nothing
can
be
greater
or
finer
than
this
it
is
so
great
and
so
fine
that
when
the
historian
of
the
future
shall
speak
of
theodore
roosevelt
he
is
likely
to
say
that
he
did
many
notable
things
among
them
that
of
inaugurating
the
movement
which
finally
resulted
in
the
square
deal
but
that
his
greatest
work
was
inspiring
and
actually
beginning
a
world
movement
for
staying
terrestrial
waste
and
saving
for
the
human
race
the
things
upon
which
and
upon
which
alone
a
great
and
peaceful
and
progressive
and
happy
race
life
can
be
founded
what
statesman
in
all
history
has
done
anything
calling
for
so
wide
a
view
and
for
a
purpose
more
lofty
chapter
xi
the
natural
resources
of
the
nation
when
governor
of
new
york
as
i
have
already
described
i
had
been
in
consultation
with
gifford
pinchot
and
newell
and
had
shaped
my
recommendations
about
forestry
largely
in
accordance
with
their
suggestions
like
other
men
who
had
thought
about
the
national
future
at
all
i
had
been
growing
more
and
more
concerned
over
the
destruction
of
the
forests
while
i
had
lived
in
the
west
i
had
come
to
realize
the
vital
need
of
irrigation
to
the
country
and
i
had
been
both
amused
and
irritated
by
the
attitude
of
eastern
men
who
obtained
from
congress
grants
of
national
money
to
develop
harbors
and
yet
fought
the
use
of
the
power
to
develop
the
irrigation
work
of
the
west
major
john
wesley
powell
the
explorer
of
the
grand
canyon
and
director
of
the
geological
survey
was
the
first
man
who
fought
for
irrigation
and
he
lived
to
see
the
reclamation
act
passed
and
construction
actually
begun
newell
the
present
director
of
the
reclamation
service
began
his
work
as
an
assistant
hydraulic
engineer
under
major
powell
and
unlike
powell
he
appreciated
the
need
of
saving
the
forests
and
the
soil
as
well
as
the
need
of
irrigation
between
powell
and
newell
came
as
director
of
the
geological
survey
charles
walcott
who
after
the
reclamation
act
was
passed
by
his
force
pertinacity
and
tact
succeeded
in
putting
the
act
into
effect
in
the
best
possible
manner
senator
francis
newlands
of
nevada
fought
hard
for
the
cause
of
reclamation
in
congress
he
attempted
to
get
his
state
to
act
and
when
that
proved
hopeless
to
get
the
nation
to
act
and
was
ably
assisted
by
maxwell
a
californian
who
had
taken
a
deep
interest
in
irrigation
matters
mcgee
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
all
the
later
stages
of
the
movement
but
gifford
pinchot
is
the
man
to
whom
the
nation
owes
most
for
what
has
been
accomplished
as
regards
the
preservation
of
the
natural
resources
of
our
country
he
led
and
indeed
during
its
most
vital
period
embodied
the
fight
for
the
preservation
through
use
of
our
forests
he
played
one
of
the
leading
parts
in
the
effort
to
make
the
national
government
the
chief
instrument
in
developing
the
irrigation
of
the
arid
west
he
was
the
foremost
leader
in
the
great
struggle
to
coordinate
all
our
social
and
governmental
forces
in
the
effort
to
secure
the
adoption
of
a
rational
and
farseeing
policy
for
securing
the
conservation
of
all
our
national
resources
he
was
already
in
the
government
service
as
head
of
the
forestry
bureau
when
i
became
president
he
continued
throughout
my
term
not
only
as
head
of
the
forest
service
but
as
the
moving
and
directing
spirit
in
most
of
the
conservation
work
and
as
counsellor
and
assistant
on
most
of
the
other
work
connected
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country
taking
into
account
the
varied
nature
of
the
work
he
did
its
vital
importance
to
the
nation
and
the
fact
that
as
regards
much
of
it
he
was
practically
breaking
new
ground
and
taking
into
account
also
his
tireless
energy
and
activity
his
fearlessness
his
complete
disinterestedness
his
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
plain
people
and
his
extraordinary
efficiency
i
believe
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
among
the
many
many
public
officials
who
under
my
administration
rendered
literally
invaluable
service
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
he
on
the
whole
stood
first
a
few
months
after
i
left
the
presidency
he
was
removed
from
office
by
president
taft
the
first
work
i
took
up
when
i
became
president
was
the
work
of
reclamation
immediately
after
i
had
come
to
washington
after
the
assassination
of
president
mckinley
while
staying
at
the
house
of
my
sister
cowles
before
going
into
the
white
house
newell
and
pinchot
called
upon
me
and
laid
before
me
their
plans
for
national
irrigation
of
the
arid
lands
of
the
west
and
for
the
consolidation
of
the
forest
work
of
the
government
in
the
bureau
of
forestry
at
that
time
a
narrowly
legalistic
point
of
view
toward
natural
resources
obtained
in
the
departments
and
controlled
the
governmental
administrative
machinery
through
the
general
land
office
and
other
government
bureaus
the
public
resources
were
being
handled
and
disposed
of
in
accordance
with
the
small
considerations
of
petty
legal
formalities
instead
of
for
the
large
purposes
of
constructive
development
and
the
habit
of
deciding
whenever
possible
in
favor
of
private
interests
against
the
public
welfare
was
firmly
fixed
it
was
as
little
customary
to
favor
the
settler
and
home
builder
as
against
the
strict
construction
of
the
law
as
it
was
to
use
the
law
in
thwarting
the
operations
of
the
land
grabbers
a
technical
compliance
with
the
letter
of
the
law
was
all
that
was
required
the
idea
that
our
natural
resources
were
inexhaustible
still
obtained
and
there
was
as
yet
no
real
knowledge
of
their
extent
and
condition
the
relation
of
the
conservation
of
natural
resources
to
the
problems
of
national
welfare
and
national
efficiency
had
not
yet
dawned
on
the
public
mind
the
reclamation
of
arid
public
lands
in
the
west
was
still
a
matter
for
private
enterprise
alone
and
our
magnificent
river
system
with
its
superb
possibilities
for
public
usefulness
was
dealt
with
by
the
national
government
not
as
a
unit
but
as
a
disconnected
series
of
problems
whose
only
real
interest
was
in
their
effect
on
the
reelection
or
defeat
of
a
congressman
here
and
there
a
theory
which
i
regret
to
say
still
obtains
the
place
of
the
farmer
in
the
national
economy
was
still
regarded
solely
as
that
of
a
grower
of
food
to
be
eaten
by
others
while
the
human
needs
and
interests
of
himself
and
his
wife
and
children
still
remained
wholly
outside
the
recognition
of
the
government
all
the
forests
which
belonged
to
the
united
states
were
held
and
administered
in
one
department
and
all
the
foresters
in
government
employ
were
in
another
department
forests
and
foresters
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
each
other
the
national
forests
in
the
west
then
called
forest
reserves
were
wholly
inadequate
in
area
to
meet
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
created
while
the
need
for
forest
protection
in
the
east
had
not
yet
begun
to
enter
the
public
mind
such
was
the
condition
of
things
when
newell
and
pinchot
called
on
me
i
was
a
warm
believer
in
reclamation
and
in
forestry
and
after
listening
to
my
two
guests
i
asked
them
to
prepare
material
on
the
subject
for
me
to
use
in
my
first
message
to
congress
of
december
this
message
laid
the
foundation
for
the
development
of
irrigation
and
forestry
during
the
next
seven
and
years
it
set
forth
the
new
attitude
toward
the
natural
resources
in
the
words
the
forest
and
water
problems
are
perhaps
the
most
vital
internal
problems
of
the
united
states
on
the
day
the
message
was
read
a
committee
of
western
senators
and
congressmen
was
organized
to
prepare
a
reclamation
bill
in
accordance
with
the
recommendations
by
far
the
most
effective
of
the
senators
in
drafting
and
pushing
the
bill
which
became
known
by
his
name
was
newlands
the
draft
of
the
bill
was
worked
over
by
me
and
others
at
several
conferences
and
revised
in
important
particulars
my
active
interference
was
necessary
to
prevent
it
from
being
made
unworkable
by
an
undue
insistence
upon
states
rights
in
accordance
with
the
efforts
of
mondell
and
other
congressmen
who
consistently
fought
for
local
and
private
interests
as
against
the
interests
of
the
people
as
a
whole
on
june
the
reclamation
act
was
passed
it
set
aside
the
proceeds
of
the
disposal
of
public
lands
for
the
purpose
of
reclaiming
the
waste
areas
of
the
arid
west
by
irrigating
lands
otherwise
worthless
and
thus
creating
new
homes
upon
the
land
the
money
so
appropriated
was
to
be
repaid
to
the
government
by
the
settlers
and
to
be
used
again
as
a
revolving
fund
continuously
available
for
the
work
the
impatience
of
the
western
people
to
see
immediate
results
from
the
reclamation
act
was
so
great
that
red
tape
was
disregarded
and
the
work
was
pushed
forward
at
a
rate
previously
unknown
in
government
affairs
later
as
in
almost
all
such
cases
there
followed
the
criticisms
of
alleged
illegality
and
haste
which
are
so
easy
to
make
after
results
have
been
accomplished
and
the
need
for
the
measures
without
which
nothing
could
have
been
done
has
gone
by
these
criticisms
were
in
character
precisely
the
same
as
that
made
about
the
acquisition
of
panama
the
settlement
of
the
anthracite
coal
strike
the
suits
against
the
big
trusts
the
stopping
of
the
panic
of
by
the
action
of
the
executive
concerning
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
and
in
short
about
most
of
the
best
work
done
during
my
administration
with
the
reclamation
work
as
with
much
other
work
under
me
the
men
in
charge
were
given
to
understand
that
they
must
get
into
the
water
if
they
would
learn
to
swim
and
furthermore
they
learned
to
know
that
if
they
acted
honestly
and
boldly
and
fearlessly
accepted
responsibility
i
would
stand
by
them
to
the
limit
in
this
as
in
every
other
case
in
the
end
the
boldness
of
the
action
fully
justified
itself
every
item
of
the
whole
great
plan
of
reclamation
now
in
effect
was
undertaken
between
and
by
the
spring
of
the
work
was
an
assured
success
and
the
government
had
become
fully
committed
to
its
continuance
the
work
of
reclamation
was
at
first
under
the
united
states
geological
survey
of
which
charles
walcott
was
at
that
time
director
in
the
spring
of
the
united
states
reclamation
service
was
established
to
carry
it
on
under
the
direction
of
frederick
hayes
newell
to
whom
the
inception
of
the
plan
was
due
devotion
to
this
great
task
the
constructive
imagination
which
enabled
him
to
conceive
it
and
the
executive
power
and
high
character
through
which
he
and
his
assistant
arthur
davis
built
up
a
model
service
all
these
have
made
him
a
model
servant
the
final
proof
of
his
merit
is
supplied
by
the
character
and
records
of
the
men
who
later
assailed
him
although
the
gross
expenditure
under
the
reclamation
act
is
not
yet
as
large
as
that
for
the
panama
canal
the
engineering
obstacles
to
be
overcome
have
been
almost
as
great
and
the
political
impediments
many
times
greater
the
reclamation
work
had
to
be
carried
on
at
widely
separated
points
remote
from
railroads
under
the
most
difficult
pioneer
conditions
the
projects
begun
in
the
years
to
contemplated
the
irrigation
of
more
than
three
million
acres
and
the
watering
of
more
than
thirty
thousand
farms
many
of
the
dams
required
for
this
huge
task
are
higher
than
any
previously
built
anywhere
in
the
world
they
feed
canals
over
seven
thousand
miles
in
total
length
and
involve
minor
constructions
such
as
culverts
and
bridges
tens
of
thousands
in
number
what
the
reclamation
act
has
done
for
the
country
is
by
no
means
limited
to
its
material
accomplishment
this
act
and
the
results
flowing
from
it
have
helped
powerfully
to
prove
to
the
nation
that
it
can
handle
its
own
resources
and
exercise
direct
and
control
over
them
the
population
which
the
reclamation
act
has
brought
into
the
arid
west
while
comparatively
small
when
compared
with
that
in
the
more
closely
inhabited
east
has
been
a
most
effective
contribution
to
the
national
life
for
it
has
gone
far
to
transform
the
social
aspect
of
the
west
making
for
the
stability
of
the
institutions
upon
which
the
welfare
of
the
whole
country
rests
it
has
substituted
actual
homemakers
who
have
settled
on
the
land
with
their
families
for
huge
migratory
bands
of
sheep
herded
by
the
hired
shepherds
of
absentee
owners
the
recent
attacks
on
the
reclamation
service
and
on
newell
arise
in
large
part
if
not
altogether
from
an
organized
effort
to
repudiate
the
obligation
of
the
settlers
to
repay
the
government
for
what
it
has
expended
to
reclaim
the
land
the
repudiation
of
any
debt
can
always
find
supporters
and
in
this
case
it
has
attracted
the
support
not
only
of
certain
men
among
the
settlers
who
hope
to
be
relieved
of
paying
what
they
owe
but
also
of
a
variety
of
unscrupulous
politicians
some
highly
placed
it
is
unlikely
that
their
efforts
to
deprive
the
west
of
the
revolving
irrigation
fund
will
succeed
in
doing
anything
but
discrediting
these
politicians
in
the
sight
of
all
honest
men
when
in
the
spring
of
i
visited
the
roosevelt
dam
in
arizona
and
opened
the
reservoir
i
made
a
short
speech
to
the
assembled
people
among
other
things
i
said
to
the
engineers
present
that
in
the
name
of
all
good
citizens
i
thanked
them
for
their
admirable
work
as
efficient
as
it
was
honest
and
conducted
according
to
the
highest
standards
of
public
service
as
i
looked
at
the
fine
strong
eager
faces
of
those
of
the
force
who
were
present
and
thought
of
the
similar
men
in
the
service
in
the
higher
positions
who
were
absent
and
who
were
no
less
responsible
for
the
work
done
i
felt
a
foreboding
that
they
would
never
receive
any
real
recognition
for
their
achievement
and
only
half
humorously
i
warned
them
not
to
expect
any
credit
or
any
satisfaction
except
their
own
knowledge
that
they
had
done
well
a
job
for
that
probably
the
only
attention
congress
would
ever
pay
them
would
be
to
investigate
them
well
a
year
later
a
congressional
committee
actually
did
investigate
them
the
investigation
was
instigated
by
some
unscrupulous
local
politicians
and
by
some
settlers
who
wished
to
be
relieved
from
paying
their
just
obligations
and
the
members
of
the
committee
joined
in
the
attack
on
as
fine
and
honorable
a
set
of
public
servants
as
the
government
has
ever
had
an
attack
made
on
them
solely
because
they
were
honorable
and
efficient
and
loyal
to
the
interests
both
of
the
government
and
the
settlers
when
i
became
president
the
bureau
of
forestry
since
the
united
states
forest
service
was
a
small
but
growing
organization
under
gifford
pinchot
occupied
mainly
with
laying
the
foundation
of
american
forestry
by
scientific
study
of
the
forests
and
with
the
promotion
of
forestry
on
private
lands
it
contained
all
the
trained
foresters
in
the
government
service
but
had
charge
of
no
public
timberland
whatsoever
the
government
forest
reserves
of
that
day
were
in
the
care
of
a
division
in
the
general
land
office
under
the
management
of
clerks
wholly
without
knowledge
of
forestry
few
if
any
of
whom
had
ever
seen
a
foot
of
the
timberlands
for
which
they
were
responsible
thus
the
reserves
were
neither
well
protected
nor
well
used
there
were
no
foresters
among
the
men
who
had
charge
of
the
national
forests
and
no
government
forests
in
charge
of
the
government
foresters
in
my
first
message
to
congress
i
strongly
recommended
the
consolidation
of
the
forest
work
in
the
hands
of
the
trained
men
of
the
bureau
of
forestry
this
recommendation
was
repeated
in
other
messages
but
congress
did
not
give
effect
to
it
until
three
years
later
in
the
meantime
by
thorough
study
of
the
western
public
timberlands
the
groundwork
was
laid
for
the
responsibilities
which
were
to
fall
upon
the
bureau
of
forestry
when
the
care
of
the
national
forests
came
to
be
transferred
to
it
it
was
evident
that
trained
american
foresters
would
be
needed
in
considerable
numbers
and
a
forest
school
was
established
at
yale
to
supply
them
in
at
my
suggestion
as
president
the
secretary
of
the
interior
hitchcock
made
a
formal
request
for
technical
advice
from
the
bureau
of
forestry
in
handling
the
national
forests
and
an
extensive
examination
of
their
condition
and
needs
was
accordingly
taken
up
the
same
year
a
study
was
begun
of
the
proposed
appalachian
national
forest
the
plan
of
which
already
formulated
at
that
time
has
since
been
carried
out
a
year
later
experimental
planting
on
the
national
forests
was
also
begun
and
studies
preparatory
to
the
application
of
practical
forestry
to
the
indian
reservations
were
undertaken
in
so
rapidly
did
the
public
work
of
the
bureau
of
forestry
increase
that
the
examination
of
land
for
new
forest
reserves
was
added
to
the
study
of
those
already
created
the
forest
lands
of
the
various
states
were
studied
and
cooperation
with
several
of
them
in
the
examination
and
handling
of
their
forest
lands
was
undertaken
while
these
practical
tasks
were
pushed
forward
a
technical
knowledge
of
american
forests
was
rapidly
accumulated
the
special
knowledge
gained
was
made
public
in
printed
bulletins
and
at
the
same
time
the
bureau
undertook
through
the
newspaper
and
periodical
press
to
make
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
acquainted
with
the
needs
and
the
purposes
of
practical
forestry
it
is
doubtful
whether
there
has
ever
been
elsewhere
under
the
government
such
effective
publicity
publicity
purely
in
the
interest
of
the
people
at
so
low
a
cost
before
the
educational
work
of
the
forest
service
was
stopped
by
the
taft
administration
it
was
securing
the
publication
of
facts
about
forestry
in
fifty
million
copies
of
newspapers
a
month
at
a
total
expense
of
a
year
not
one
cent
has
ever
been
paid
by
the
forest
service
to
any
publication
of
any
kind
for
the
printing
of
this
material
it
was
given
out
freely
and
published
without
cost
because
it
was
news
without
this
publicity
the
forest
service
could
not
have
survived
the
attacks
made
upon
it
by
the
representatives
of
the
great
special
interests
in
congress
nor
could
forestry
in
america
have
made
the
rapid
progress
it
has
the
result
of
all
the
work
outlined
above
was
to
bring
together
in
the
bureau
of
forestry
by
the
end
of
the
only
body
of
forest
experts
under
the
government
and
practically
all
of
the
information
about
the
public
forests
which
was
then
in
existence
in
the
obvious
foolishness
of
continuing
to
separate
the
foresters
and
the
forests
reenforced
by
the
action
of
the
first
national
forest
congress
held
in
washington
brought
about
the
act
of
february
which
transferred
the
national
forests
from
the
care
of
the
interior
department
to
the
department
of
agriculture
and
resulted
in
the
creation
of
the
present
united
states
forest
service
the
men
upon
whom
the
responsibility
of
handling
some
sixty
million
acres
of
national
forest
lands
was
thus
thrown
were
ready
for
the
work
both
in
the
office
and
in
the
field
because
they
had
been
preparing
for
it
for
more
than
five
years
without
delay
they
proceeded
under
the
leadership
of
pinchot
to
apply
to
the
new
work
the
principles
they
had
already
formulated
one
of
these
was
to
open
all
the
resources
of
the
national
forests
to
regulated
use
another
was
that
of
putting
every
part
of
the
land
to
that
use
in
which
it
would
best
serve
the
public
following
this
principle
the
act
of
june
was
drawn
and
its
passage
was
secured
from
congress
this
law
throws
open
to
settlement
all
land
in
the
national
forests
that
is
found
on
examination
to
be
chiefly
valuable
for
agriculture
hitherto
all
such
land
had
been
closed
to
the
settler
the
principles
thus
formulated
and
applied
may
be
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
the
rights
of
the
public
to
the
natural
resources
outweigh
private
rights
and
must
be
given
its
first
consideration
until
that
time
in
dealing
with
the
national
forests
and
the
public
lands
generally
private
rights
had
almost
uniformly
been
allowed
to
overbalance
public
rights
the
change
we
made
was
right
and
was
vitally
necessary
but
of
course
it
created
bitter
opposition
from
private
interests
one
of
the
principles
whose
application
was
the
source
of
much
hostility
was
this
it
is
better
for
the
government
to
help
a
poor
man
to
make
a
living
for
his
family
than
to
help
a
rich
man
make
more
profit
for
his
company
this
principle
was
too
sound
to
be
fought
openly
it
is
the
kind
of
principle
to
which
politicians
delight
to
pay
unctuous
homage
in
words
but
we
translated
the
words
into
deeds
and
when
they
found
that
this
was
the
case
many
rich
men
especially
sheep
owners
were
stirred
to
hostility
and
they
used
the
congressmen
they
controlled
to
assault
us
getting
most
aid
from
certain
demagogues
who
were
equally
glad
improperly
to
denounce
rich
men
in
public
and
improperly
to
serve
them
in
private
the
forest
service
established
and
enforced
regulations
which
favored
the
settler
as
against
the
large
stock
owner
required
that
necessary
reductions
in
the
stock
grazed
on
any
national
forest
should
bear
first
on
the
big
man
before
the
few
head
of
the
small
man
upon
which
the
living
of
his
family
depended
were
reduced
and
made
grazing
in
the
national
forests
a
help
instead
of
a
hindrance
to
permanent
settlement
as
a
result
the
small
settlers
and
their
families
became
on
the
whole
the
best
friends
the
forest
service
has
although
in
places
their
ignorance
was
played
on
by
demagogues
to
influence
them
against
the
policy
that
was
primarily
for
their
own
interest
another
principle
which
led
to
the
bitterest
antagonism
of
all
was
this
whoever
except
a
settler
takes
public
property
for
private
profit
should
pay
for
what
he
gets
in
the
effort
to
apply
this
principle
the
forest
service
obtained
a
decision
from
the
that
it
was
legal
to
make
the
men
who
grazed
sheep
and
cattle
on
the
national
forests
pay
for
what
they
got
accordingly
in
the
summer
of
for
the
first
time
such
a
charge
was
made
and
in
the
face
of
the
bitterest
opposition
it
was
collected
up
to
the
time
the
national
forests
were
put
under
the
charge
of
the
forest
service
the
interior
department
had
made
no
effort
to
establish
public
regulation
and
control
of
water
powers
upon
the
transfer
the
service
immediately
began
its
fight
to
handle
the
power
resources
of
the
national
forests
so
as
to
prevent
speculation
and
monopoly
and
to
yield
a
fair
return
to
the
government
on
may
an
act
was
passed
granting
the
use
of
certain
power
sites
in
southern
california
to
the
edison
electric
power
company
which
act
at
the
suggestion
of
the
service
limited
the
period
of
the
permit
to
forty
years
and
required
the
payment
of
an
annual
rental
by
the
company
the
same
conditions
which
were
thereafter
adopted
by
the
service
as
the
basis
for
all
permits
for
power
development
then
began
a
vigorous
fight
against
the
position
of
the
service
by
the
interests
the
right
to
charge
for
development
was
however
sustained
by
the
in
the
area
of
the
national
forests
was
increased
by
presidential
proclamation
more
than
million
acres
the
plant
necessary
for
the
full
use
of
the
forests
such
as
roads
trails
and
telephone
lines
began
to
be
provided
on
a
large
scale
the
interchange
of
field
and
office
men
so
as
to
prevent
the
antagonism
between
them
which
is
so
destructive
of
efficiency
in
most
great
businesses
was
established
as
a
permanent
policy
and
the
really
effective
management
of
the
enormous
area
of
the
national
forests
began
to
be
secured
with
all
this
activity
in
the
field
the
progress
of
technical
forestry
and
popular
education
was
not
neglected
in
for
example
publications
on
various
phases
of
forestry
with
a
total
of
more
than
a
million
copies
were
issued
as
against
three
publications
with
a
total
of
thousand
copies
in
by
this
time
also
the
opposition
of
the
servants
of
the
special
interests
in
congress
to
the
forest
service
had
become
strongly
developed
and
more
time
appeared
to
be
spent
in
the
yearly
attacks
upon
it
during
the
passage
of
the
appropriation
bills
than
on
all
other
government
bureaus
put
together
every
year
the
forest
service
had
to
fight
for
its
life
one
incident
in
these
attacks
is
worth
recording
while
the
agricultural
appropriation
bill
was
passing
through
the
senate
in
senator
fulton
of
oregon
secured
an
amendment
providing
that
the
president
could
not
set
aside
any
additional
national
forests
in
the
six
northwestern
states
this
meant
retaining
some
sixteen
million
of
acres
to
be
exploited
by
land
grabbers
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
great
special
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
public
interest
but
for
four
years
the
forest
service
had
been
gathering
field
notes
as
to
what
forests
ought
to
be
set
aside
in
these
states
and
so
was
prepared
to
act
it
was
equally
undesirable
to
veto
the
whole
agricultural
bill
and
to
sign
it
with
this
amendment
effective
accordingly
a
plan
to
create
the
necessary
national
forest
in
these
states
before
the
agricultural
bill
could
be
passed
and
signed
was
laid
before
me
by
pinchot
i
approved
it
the
necessary
papers
were
immediately
prepared
i
signed
the
last
proclamation
a
couple
of
days
before
by
my
signature
the
bill
became
law
and
when
the
friends
of
the
special
interests
in
the
senate
got
their
amendment
through
and
woke
up
they
discovered
that
sixteen
million
acres
of
timberland
had
been
saved
for
the
people
by
putting
them
in
the
national
forests
before
the
land
grabbers
could
get
at
them
the
opponents
of
the
forest
service
turned
handsprings
in
their
wrath
and
dire
were
their
threats
against
the
executive
but
the
threats
could
not
be
carried
out
and
were
really
only
a
tribute
to
the
efficiency
of
our
action
by
the
fire
prevention
work
of
the
forest
service
had
become
so
successful
that
per
cent
of
the
fires
that
did
occur
were
held
down
to
an
area
of
five
acres
or
less
and
the
timber
sales
which
yielded
in
in
produced
in
the
same
year
in
addition
to
the
work
of
the
national
forests
the
responsibility
for
the
proper
handling
of
indian
timberlands
was
laid
upon
the
forest
service
where
it
remained
with
great
benefit
to
the
indians
until
it
was
withdrawn
as
a
part
of
the
attack
on
the
conservation
policy
made
after
i
left
office
by
march
nearly
half
a
million
acres
of
agricultural
land
in
the
national
forests
had
been
opened
to
settlement
under
the
act
of
june
the
business
management
of
the
forest
service
became
so
excellent
thanks
to
the
remarkable
executive
capacity
of
the
associate
forester
overton
price
removed
after
i
left
office
that
it
was
declared
by
a
firm
of
business
organizers
to
compare
favorably
with
the
best
managed
of
the
great
private
corporations
an
opinion
which
was
confirmed
by
the
report
of
a
congressional
investigation
and
by
the
report
of
the
presidential
committee
on
department
method
the
area
of
the
national
forests
had
increased
from
to
million
acres
the
force
from
about
to
more
than
there
was
saved
for
public
use
in
the
national
forests
more
government
timberland
during
the
seven
and
a
half
years
prior
to
march
than
during
all
previous
and
succeeding
years
put
together
the
idea
that
the
executive
is
the
steward
of
the
public
welfare
was
first
formulated
and
given
practical
effect
in
the
forest
service
by
its
law
officer
george
woodruff
the
laws
were
often
insufficient
and
it
became
impossible
to
get
them
amended
in
the
public
interest
when
once
the
representatives
of
privilege
in
congress
grasped
the
fact
that
i
would
sign
no
amendment
that
contained
anything
not
in
the
public
interest
it
was
necessary
to
use
what
law
was
already
in
existence
and
then
further
to
supplement
it
by
executive
action
the
practice
of
examining
every
claim
to
public
land
before
passing
it
into
private
ownership
offers
a
good
example
of
the
policy
in
question
this
practice
which
has
since
become
general
was
first
applied
in
the
national
forests
enormous
areas
of
valuable
public
timberland
were
thereby
saved
from
fraudulent
acquisition
more
than
acres
were
thus
saved
in
a
single
case
this
theory
of
stewardship
in
the
interest
of
the
public
was
well
illustrated
by
the
establishment
of
a
policy
until
the
forest
service
changed
the
plan
on
the
navigable
streams
on
the
public
domain
and
in
the
national
forests
were
given
away
for
nothing
and
substantially
without
question
to
whoever
asked
for
them
at
last
under
the
principle
that
public
property
should
be
paid
for
and
should
not
be
permanently
granted
away
when
such
permanent
grant
is
avoidable
the
forest
service
established
the
policy
of
regulating
the
use
of
power
in
the
national
forests
in
the
public
interest
and
making
a
charge
for
value
received
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
policy
now
substantially
accepted
by
the
public
and
doubtless
soon
to
be
enacted
into
law
but
there
was
at
the
outset
violent
opposition
to
it
on
the
part
of
the
companies
and
such
representatives
of
their
views
in
congress
as
tawney
and
bede
many
bills
were
introduced
in
congress
aimed
in
one
way
or
another
at
relieving
the
power
companies
of
control
and
payment
when
these
bills
reached
me
i
refused
to
sign
them
and
the
injury
to
the
public
interest
which
would
follow
their
passage
was
brought
sharply
to
public
attention
in
my
message
of
february
the
bills
made
no
further
progress
under
the
same
principle
of
stewardship
railroads
and
other
corporations
which
applied
for
and
were
given
rights
in
the
national
forests
were
regulated
in
the
use
of
those
rights
in
short
the
public
resources
in
charge
of
the
forest
service
were
handled
frankly
and
openly
for
the
public
welfare
under
the
and
clearly
set
forth
principle
that
the
public
rights
come
first
and
private
interest
second
the
natural
result
of
this
new
attitude
was
the
assertion
in
every
form
by
the
representatives
of
special
interests
that
the
forest
service
was
exceeding
its
legal
powers
and
thwarting
the
intention
of
congress
suits
were
begun
wherever
the
chance
arose
it
is
worth
recording
that
in
spite
of
the
novelty
and
complexity
of
the
legal
questions
it
had
to
face
no
court
of
last
resort
has
ever
decided
against
the
forest
service
this
statement
includes
two
unanimous
decisions
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
grimaud
and
light
in
its
administration
of
the
national
forests
the
forest
service
found
that
valuable
coal
lands
were
in
danger
of
passing
into
private
ownership
without
adequate
money
return
to
the
government
and
without
safeguard
against
monopoly
and
that
existing
legislation
was
insufficient
to
prevent
this
when
this
condition
was
brought
to
my
attention
i
withdrew
from
all
forms
of
entry
about
million
acres
of
coal
land
in
the
united
states
including
alaska
the
refusal
of
congress
to
act
in
the
public
interest
was
solely
responsible
for
keeping
these
lands
from
entry
the
conservation
movement
was
a
direct
outgrowth
of
the
forest
movement
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
application
to
our
other
natural
resources
of
the
principles
which
had
been
worked
out
in
connection
with
the
forests
without
the
basis
of
public
sentiment
which
had
been
built
up
for
the
protection
of
the
forests
and
without
the
example
of
public
foresight
in
the
protection
of
this
one
of
the
great
natural
resources
the
conservation
movement
would
have
been
impossible
the
first
formal
step
was
the
creation
of
the
inland
waterways
commission
appointed
on
march
in
my
letter
appointing
the
commission
i
called
attention
to
the
value
of
our
streams
as
great
natural
resources
and
to
the
need
for
a
progressive
plan
for
their
development
and
control
and
said
it
is
not
possible
to
properly
frame
so
large
a
plan
as
this
for
the
control
of
our
rivers
without
taking
account
of
the
orderly
development
of
other
natural
resources
therefore
i
ask
that
the
inland
waterways
commission
shall
consider
the
relations
of
the
streams
to
the
use
of
all
the
great
permanent
natural
resources
and
their
conservation
for
the
making
and
maintenance
of
prosperous
homes
over
a
year
later
writing
on
the
report
of
the
commission
i
said
the
preliminary
report
of
the
inland
waterways
commission
was
excellent
in
every
way
it
outlines
a
general
plan
of
waterway
improvement
which
when
adopted
will
give
assurance
that
the
improvements
will
yield
practical
results
in
the
way
of
increased
navigation
and
water
transportation
in
every
essential
feature
the
plan
recommended
by
the
commission
is
new
in
the
principle
of
coordinating
all
uses
of
the
waters
and
treating
each
waterway
system
as
a
unit
in
the
principle
of
correlating
water
traffic
with
rail
and
other
land
traffic
in
the
principle
of
expert
initiation
of
projects
in
accordance
with
commercial
foresight
and
the
needs
of
a
growing
country
and
in
the
principle
of
cooperation
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
in
the
administration
and
use
of
waterways
etc
the
general
plan
proposed
by
the
commission
is
new
and
at
the
same
time
sane
and
simple
the
plan
deserves
unqualified
support
i
regret
that
it
has
not
yet
been
adopted
by
congress
but
i
am
confident
that
ultimately
it
will
be
adopted
the
most
striking
incident
in
the
history
of
the
commission
was
the
trip
down
the
mississippi
river
in
october
when
as
president
of
the
united
states
i
was
the
chief
guest
this
excursion
with
the
meetings
which
were
held
and
the
wide
public
attention
it
attracted
gave
the
development
of
our
inland
waterways
a
new
standing
in
public
estimation
during
the
trip
a
letter
was
prepared
and
presented
to
me
asking
me
to
summon
a
conference
on
the
conservation
of
natural
resources
my
intention
to
call
such
a
conference
was
publicly
announced
at
a
great
meeting
at
memphis
tenn
in
the
november
following
i
wrote
to
each
of
the
governors
of
the
several
states
and
to
the
presidents
of
various
important
national
societies
concerned
with
natural
resources
inviting
them
to
attend
the
conference
which
took
place
may
to
in
the
east
room
of
the
white
house
it
is
doubtful
whether
except
in
time
of
war
any
new
idea
of
like
importance
has
ever
been
presented
to
a
nation
and
accepted
by
it
with
such
effectiveness
and
rapidity
as
was
the
case
with
this
conservation
movement
when
it
was
introduced
to
the
american
people
by
the
conference
of
governors
the
first
result
was
the
unanimous
declaration
of
the
governors
of
all
the
states
and
territories
upon
the
subject
of
conservation
a
document
which
ought
to
be
hung
in
every
schoolhouse
throughout
the
land
a
further
result
was
the
appointment
of
state
conservation
commissions
and
on
june
of
the
national
conservation
commission
the
task
of
this
commission
was
to
prepare
an
inventory
the
first
ever
made
for
any
nation
of
all
the
natural
resources
which
underlay
its
property
the
making
of
this
inventory
was
made
possible
by
an
executive
order
which
placed
the
resources
of
the
government
departments
at
the
command
of
the
commission
and
made
possible
the
organization
of
subsidiary
committees
by
which
the
actual
facts
for
the
inventory
were
prepared
and
digested
gifford
pinchot
was
made
chairman
of
the
commission
the
report
of
the
national
conservation
commission
was
not
only
the
first
inventory
of
our
resources
but
was
unique
in
the
history
of
government
in
the
amount
and
variety
of
information
brought
together
it
was
completed
in
six
months
it
laid
squarely
before
the
american
people
the
essential
facts
regarding
our
natural
resources
when
facts
were
greatly
needed
as
the
basis
for
constructive
action
this
report
was
presented
to
the
joint
conservation
congress
in
december
at
which
there
were
present
governors
of
twenty
states
representatives
of
state
conservation
commissions
and
representatives
of
sixty
national
organizations
previously
represented
at
the
white
house
conference
the
report
was
unanimously
approved
and
transmitted
to
me
january
on
january
i
transmitted
the
report
of
the
national
conservation
commission
to
congress
with
a
special
message
in
which
it
was
accurately
described
as
one
of
the
most
fundamentally
important
documents
ever
laid
before
the
american
people
the
joint
conservation
conference
of
december
suggested
to
me
the
practicability
of
holding
a
north
american
conservation
conference
i
selected
gifford
pinchot
to
convey
this
invitation
in
person
to
lord
grey
governor
general
of
canada
to
sir
wilfrid
laurier
and
to
president
diaz
of
mexico
giving
as
reason
for
my
action
in
the
letter
in
which
this
invitation
was
conveyed
the
fact
that
it
is
evident
that
natural
resources
are
not
limited
by
the
boundary
lines
which
separate
nations
and
that
the
need
for
conserving
them
upon
this
continent
is
as
wide
as
the
area
upon
which
they
exist
in
response
to
this
invitation
which
included
the
colony
of
newfoundland
the
commissioners
assembled
in
the
white
house
on
february
the
american
commissioners
were
gifford
pinchot
robert
bacon
and
james
garfield
after
a
session
continuing
through
five
days
the
conference
united
in
a
declaration
of
principles
and
suggested
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
all
nations
should
be
invited
to
join
together
in
conference
on
the
subject
of
world
resources
and
their
inventory
conservation
and
wise
utilization
accordingly
on
february
robert
bacon
secretary
of
state
addressed
to
nations
a
letter
of
invitation
to
send
delegates
to
a
conference
to
be
held
at
the
hague
at
such
date
to
be
found
convenient
there
to
meet
and
consult
the
like
delegates
of
the
other
countries
with
a
view
of
considering
a
general
plan
for
an
inventory
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
world
and
to
devising
a
uniform
scheme
for
the
expression
of
the
results
of
such
inventory
to
the
end
that
there
may
be
a
general
understanding
and
appreciation
of
the
world
supply
of
the
material
elements
which
underlie
the
development
of
civilization
and
the
welfare
of
the
peoples
of
the
earth
after
i
left
the
white
house
the
project
lapsed
throughout
the
early
part
of
my
administration
the
public
land
policy
was
chiefly
directed
to
the
defense
of
the
public
lands
against
fraud
and
theft
secretary
hitchcock
efforts
along
this
line
resulted
in
the
oregon
land
fraud
cases
which
led
to
the
conviction
of
senator
mitchell
and
which
made
francis
heney
known
to
the
american
people
as
one
of
their
best
and
most
effective
servants
these
land
fraud
prosecutions
under
heney
together
with
the
study
of
the
public
lands
which
preceded
the
passage
of
the
reclamation
act
in
and
the
investigation
of
land
titles
in
the
national
forests
by
the
forest
service
all
combined
to
create
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
need
of
land
law
reform
and
thus
led
to
the
appointment
of
the
public
lands
commission
this
commission
appointed
by
me
on
october
was
directed
to
report
to
the
president
upon
the
condition
operation
and
effect
of
the
present
land
laws
and
to
recommend
such
changes
as
are
needed
to
effect
the
largest
practicable
disposition
of
the
public
lands
to
actual
settlers
who
will
build
permanent
homes
upon
them
and
to
secure
in
permanence
the
fullest
and
most
effective
use
of
the
resources
of
the
public
lands
it
proceeded
without
loss
of
time
to
make
a
personal
study
on
the
ground
of
public
land
problems
throughout
the
west
to
confer
with
the
governors
and
other
public
men
most
concerned
and
to
assemble
the
information
concerning
the
public
lands
the
laws
and
decisions
which
governed
them
and
the
methods
of
defeating
or
evading
those
laws
which
was
already
in
existence
but
which
remained
unformulated
in
the
records
of
the
general
land
office
and
in
the
mind
of
its
employees
the
public
lands
commission
made
its
first
preliminary
report
on
march
it
found
that
the
present
land
laws
do
not
fit
the
conditions
of
the
remaining
public
lands
and
recommended
specific
changes
to
meet
the
public
needs
a
year
later
the
second
report
of
the
commission
recommended
still
further
changes
and
said
the
fundamental
fact
that
characterizes
the
situation
under
the
present
land
laws
is
this
that
the
number
of
patents
issued
is
increasing
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
number
of
new
homes
this
report
laid
the
foundation
of
the
movement
for
government
control
of
the
open
range
and
included
by
far
the
most
complete
statement
ever
made
of
the
disposition
of
the
public
domain
among
the
most
difficult
topics
considered
by
the
public
lands
commission
was
that
of
the
mineral
land
laws
this
subject
was
referred
by
the
commission
to
the
american
institute
of
mining
engineers
which
reported
upon
it
through
a
committee
this
committee
made
the
very
important
recommendation
among
others
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
should
retain
title
to
all
minerals
including
coal
and
oil
in
the
lands
of
unceded
territory
and
lease
the
same
to
individuals
or
corporations
at
a
fixed
rental
the
necessity
for
this
action
has
since
come
to
be
very
generally
recognized
another
recommendation
since
partly
carried
into
effect
was
for
the
separation
of
the
surface
and
the
minerals
in
lands
containing
coal
and
oil
our
land
laws
have
of
recent
years
proved
inefficient
yet
the
land
laws
themselves
have
not
been
so
much
to
blame
as
the
lax
unintelligent
and
often
corrupt
administration
of
these
laws
the
appointment
on
march
of
james
garfield
as
secretary
of
the
interior
led
to
a
new
era
in
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
the
laws
governing
the
public
lands
his
administration
of
the
interior
department
was
beyond
comparison
the
best
we
have
ever
had
it
was
based
primarily
on
the
conception
that
it
is
as
much
the
duty
of
public
land
officials
to
help
the
honest
settler
get
title
to
his
claim
as
it
is
to
prevent
the
looting
of
the
public
lands
the
essential
fact
about
public
land
frauds
is
not
merely
that
public
property
is
stolen
but
that
every
claim
fraudulently
acquired
stands
in
the
way
of
the
making
of
a
home
or
a
livelihood
by
an
honest
man
as
the
study
of
the
public
land
laws
proceeded
and
their
administration
improved
a
public
land
policy
was
formulated
in
which
the
saving
of
the
resources
on
the
public
domain
for
public
use
became
the
leading
principle
there
followed
the
withdrawal
of
coal
lands
as
already
described
of
oil
lands
and
phosphate
lands
and
finally
just
at
the
end
of
the
administration
of
sites
on
the
public
domain
these
withdrawals
were
made
by
the
executive
in
order
to
afford
to
congress
the
necessary
opportunity
to
pass
wise
laws
dealing
with
their
use
and
disposal
and
the
great
crooked
special
interests
fought
them
with
incredible
bitterness
among
the
men
of
this
nation
interested
in
the
vital
problems
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
ordinary
men
and
women
of
the
nation
there
is
none
whose
interest
has
been
more
intense
and
more
wholly
free
from
taint
of
thought
of
self
than
that
of
thomas
watson
of
georgia
while
president
i
often
discussed
with
him
the
condition
of
women
on
the
small
farms
and
on
the
frontier
the
hardship
of
their
lives
as
compared
with
those
of
the
men
and
the
need
for
taking
their
welfare
into
consideration
in
whatever
was
done
for
the
improvement
of
life
on
the
land
i
also
went
over
the
matter
with
barrett
of
georgia
a
leader
in
the
southern
farmers
movement
and
with
other
men
such
as
henry
wallace
dean
bailey
of
cornell
and
kenyon
butterfield
one
man
from
whose
advice
i
especially
profited
was
not
an
american
but
an
irishman
sir
horace
plunkett
in
various
conversations
he
described
to
me
and
my
close
associates
the
reconstruction
of
farm
life
which
had
been
accomplished
by
the
agricultural
organization
society
of
ireland
of
which
he
was
the
founder
and
the
controlling
force
and
he
discussed
the
application
of
similar
methods
to
the
improvements
of
farm
life
in
the
united
states
in
the
spring
of
at
my
request
plunkett
conferred
on
the
subject
with
garfield
and
pinchot
and
the
latter
suggested
to
him
the
appointment
of
a
commission
on
country
life
as
a
means
for
directing
the
attention
of
the
nation
to
the
problems
of
the
farm
and
for
securing
the
necessary
knowledge
of
the
actual
conditions
of
life
in
the
open
country
after
long
discussion
a
plan
for
a
country
life
commission
was
laid
before
me
and
approved
the
appointment
of
the
commission
followed
in
august
in
the
letter
of
appointment
the
reasons
for
creating
the
commission
were
set
forth
as
follows
i
doubt
if
any
other
nation
can
bear
comparison
with
our
own
in
the
amount
of
attention
given
by
the
government
both
federal
and
state
to
agricultural
matters
but
practically
the
whole
of
this
effort
has
hitherto
been
directed
toward
increasing
the
production
of
crops
our
attention
has
been
concentrated
almost
exclusively
on
getting
better
farming
in
the
beginning
this
was
unquestionably
the
right
thing
to
do
the
farmer
must
first
of
all
grow
good
crops
in
order
to
support
himself
and
his
family
but
when
this
has
been
secured
the
effort
for
better
farming
should
cease
to
stand
alone
and
should
be
accompanied
by
the
effort
for
better
business
and
better
living
on
the
farm
it
is
at
least
as
important
that
the
farmer
should
get
the
largest
possible
return
in
money
comfort
and
social
advantages
from
the
crops
he
grows
as
that
he
should
get
the
largest
possible
return
in
crops
from
the
land
he
farms
agriculture
is
not
the
whole
of
country
life
the
great
rural
interests
are
human
interests
and
good
crops
are
of
little
value
to
the
farmer
unless
they
open
the
door
to
a
good
kind
of
life
on
the
farm
the
commission
on
country
life
did
work
of
capital
importance
by
means
of
a
widely
circulated
set
of
questions
the
commission
informed
itself
upon
the
status
of
country
life
throughout
the
nation
its
trip
through
the
east
south
and
west
brought
it
into
contact
with
large
numbers
of
practical
farmers
and
their
wives
secured
for
the
commissioners
a
most
valuable
body
of
information
and
laid
the
foundation
for
the
remarkable
awakening
of
interest
in
country
life
which
has
since
taken
place
throughout
the
nation
one
of
the
most
illuminating
and
incidentally
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
amusing
series
of
answers
sent
to
the
commission
was
from
a
farmer
in
missouri
he
stated
that
he
had
a
wife
and
living
children
he
and
his
wife
being
each
years
old
and
that
they
owned
acres
of
land
without
any
mortgage
hanging
over
their
heads
he
had
himself
done
well
and
his
views
as
to
why
many
of
his
neighbors
had
done
less
well
are
entitled
to
consideration
these
views
are
expressed
in
terse
and
vigorous
english
they
can
not
always
be
quoted
in
full
he
states
that
the
farm
homes
in
his
neighborhood
are
not
as
good
as
they
should
be
because
too
many
of
them
are
encumbered
by
mortgages
that
the
schools
do
not
train
boys
and
girls
satisfactorily
for
life
on
the
farm
because
they
allow
them
to
get
an
idea
in
their
heads
that
city
life
is
better
and
that
to
remedy
this
practical
farming
should
be
taught
to
the
question
whether
the
farmers
and
their
wives
in
his
neighborhood
are
satisfactorily
organized
he
answers
oh
there
is
a
little
grange
gang
in
our
locality
and
every
darned
one
thinks
they
ought
to
be
a
king
to
the
question
are
the
renters
of
farms
in
your
neighborhood
making
a
satisfactory
living
he
answers
no
because
they
move
about
so
much
hunting
a
better
job
to
the
question
is
the
supply
of
farm
labor
in
your
neighborhood
satisfactory
the
answer
is
no
because
the
people
have
gone
out
of
the
baby
business
and
when
asked
as
to
the
remedy
he
answers
give
a
pension
to
every
mother
who
gives
birth
to
seven
living
boys
on
american
soil
to
the
question
are
the
conditions
surrounding
hired
labor
on
the
farm
in
your
neighborhood
satisfactory
to
the
hired
men
he
answers
yes
unless
he
is
a
drunken
cuss
adding
that
he
would
like
to
blow
up
the
stillhouses
and
root
out
whiskey
and
beer
to
the
question
are
the
sanitary
conditions
on
the
farms
in
your
neighborhood
satisfactory
he
answers
no
too
careless
about
chicken
yards
and
the
like
and
poorly
covered
wells
in
one
well
on
neighbor
farm
i
counted
seven
snakes
in
the
wall
of
the
well
and
they
used
the
water
daily
his
wife
dead
now
and
he
is
looking
for
another
he
ends
by
stating
that
the
most
important
single
thing
to
be
done
for
the
betterment
of
country
life
is
good
roads
but
in
his
answers
he
shows
very
clearly
that
most
important
of
all
is
the
individual
equation
of
the
man
or
woman
like
the
rest
of
the
commissions
described
in
this
chapter
the
country
life
commission
cost
the
government
not
one
cent
but
laid
before
the
president
and
the
country
a
mass
of
information
so
accurate
and
so
vitally
important
as
to
disturb
the
serenity
of
the
advocates
of
things
as
they
are
and
therefore
it
incurred
the
bitter
opposition
of
the
reactionaries
the
report
of
the
country
life
commission
was
transmitted
to
congress
by
me
on
february
in
the
accompanying
message
i
asked
for
to
print
and
circulate
the
report
and
to
prepare
for
publication
the
immense
amount
of
valuable
material
collected
by
the
commission
but
still
unpublished
the
reply
made
by
congress
was
not
only
a
refusal
to
appropriate
the
money
but
a
positive
prohibition
against
continuing
the
work
the
tawney
amendment
to
the
sundry
civil
bill
forbade
the
president
to
appoint
any
further
commissions
unless
specifically
authorized
by
congress
to
do
so
had
this
prohibition
been
enacted
earlier
complied
it
would
have
prevented
the
appointment
of
the
six
roosevelt
commissions
but
i
would
not
have
complied
with
it
tawney
one
of
the
most
efficient
representatives
of
the
cause
of
special
privilege
as
against
public
interest
to
be
found
in
the
house
was
later
in
conjunction
with
senator
hale
and
others
able
to
induce
my
successor
to
accept
their
view
as
what
was
almost
my
last
official
act
i
replied
to
congress
that
if
i
did
not
believe
the
tawney
amendment
to
be
unconstitutional
i
would
veto
the
sundry
civil
bill
which
contained
it
and
that
if
i
were
remaining
in
office
i
would
refuse
to
obey
it
the
memorandum
ran
in
part
the
chief
object
of
this
provision
however
is
to
prevent
the
executive
repeating
what
it
has
done
within
the
last
year
in
connection
with
the
conservation
commission
and
the
country
life
commission
it
is
for
the
people
of
the
country
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
believe
in
the
work
done
by
the
conservation
commission
and
by
the
country
life
commission
if
they
believe
in
improving
our
waterways
in
preventing
the
waste
of
soil
in
preserving
the
forests
in
thrifty
use
of
the
mineral
resources
of
the
country
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
rather
than
merely
for
private
monopolies
in
working
for
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
the
men
and
women
who
live
on
the
farms
then
they
will
unstintedly
condemn
the
action
of
every
man
who
is
in
any
way
responsible
for
inserting
this
provision
and
will
support
those
members
of
the
legislative
branch
who
opposed
its
adoption
i
would
not
sign
the
bill
at
all
if
i
thought
the
provision
entirely
effective
but
the
congress
can
not
prevent
the
president
from
seeking
advice
any
future
president
can
do
as
i
have
done
and
ask
disinterested
men
who
desire
to
serve
the
people
to
give
this
service
free
to
the
people
through
these
commissions
my
successor
the
in
a
letter
to
the
senate
committee
on
appropriations
asked
for
the
continuance
and
support
of
the
conservation
commission
the
conservation
commission
was
appointed
at
the
request
of
the
governors
of
over
forty
states
and
almost
all
of
these
states
have
since
appointed
commissions
to
cooperate
with
the
national
commission
nearly
all
the
great
national
organizations
concerned
with
natural
resources
have
been
heartily
cooperating
with
the
commission
with
all
these
facts
before
it
the
congress
has
refused
to
pass
a
law
to
continue
and
provide
for
the
commission
and
it
now
passes
a
law
with
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
executive
from
continuing
the
commission
at
all
the
executive
therefore
must
now
either
abandon
the
work
and
reject
the
cooperation
of
the
states
or
else
must
continue
the
work
personally
and
through
executive
officers
whom
he
may
select
for
that
purpose
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
spokane
washington
a
singularly
energetic
and
organization
itself
published
the
report
which
congress
had
thus
discreditably
refused
to
publish
the
work
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
under
herbert
knox
smith
formed
an
important
part
of
the
conservation
movement
almost
from
the
beginning
smith
was
a
member
of
the
inland
waterways
commission
and
of
the
national
conservation
commission
and
his
bureau
prepared
material
of
importance
for
the
reports
of
both
the
investigation
of
standing
timber
in
the
united
states
by
the
bureau
of
corporations
furnished
for
the
first
time
a
positive
knowledge
of
the
facts
over
nine
hundred
counties
in
timbered
regions
were
covered
by
the
bureau
and
the
work
took
five
years
the
most
important
facts
ascertained
were
that
forty
years
ago
of
the
standing
timber
in
the
united
states
was
publicly
owned
while
at
the
date
of
the
report
of
the
timber
in
the
country
was
in
private
hands
the
concentration
of
private
ownership
had
developed
to
such
an
amazing
extent
that
about
two
hundred
holders
owned
nearly
of
all
privately
owned
timber
in
the
united
states
and
of
this
the
three
greatest
holders
the
southern
pacific
railway
the
northern
pacific
railway
and
the
weyerhaeuser
timber
company
held
over
ten
per
cent
of
this
work
smith
says
it
was
important
indeed
to
know
the
facts
so
that
we
could
take
proper
action
toward
saving
the
timber
still
left
to
the
public
but
of
far
more
importance
was
the
light
that
this
history
and
the
history
of
our
other
resources
throws
on
the
basic
attitude
tradition
and
governmental
beliefs
of
the
american
people
the
whole
standpoint
of
the
people
toward
the
proper
aim
of
government
toward
the
relation
of
property
to
the
citizen
and
the
relation
of
property
to
the
government
were
brought
out
first
by
this
conservation
work
the
work
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
as
to
water
power
was
equally
striking
in
addition
to
bringing
the
concentration
of
control
first
prominently
to
public
attention
through
material
furnished
for
my
message
in
my
veto
of
the
james
river
dam
bill
the
work
of
the
bureau
showed
that
ten
great
interests
and
their
allies
held
nearly
sixty
per
cent
of
the
developed
water
power
of
the
united
states
says
commissioner
smith
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
in
the
whole
work
was
its
clear
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
the
only
effective
place
to
control
water
power
in
the
public
interest
is
at
the
power
sites
that
as
to
powers
now
owned
by
the
public
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
the
public
shall
retain
title
the
only
way
in
which
the
public
can
get
back
to
itself
the
margin
of
natural
advantage
in
the
site
is
to
rent
that
site
at
a
rental
which
added
to
the
cost
of
power
production
there
will
make
the
total
cost
of
water
power
about
the
same
as
fuel
power
and
then
let
the
two
sell
at
the
same
price
the
price
of
fuel
power
of
the
fight
of
the
men
for
states
rights
at
the
paul
conservation
congress
in
september
commissioner
smith
says
it
was
the
first
open
sign
of
the
shift
of
the
special
interests
to
the
democratic
party
for
a
logical
political
reason
namely
because
of
the
availability
of
the
states
rights
idea
for
the
purposes
of
the
large
corporations
it
marked
openly
the
turn
of
the
tide
smith
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
inland
waterways
commission
the
overshadowing
importance
to
waterways
of
their
relation
with
railroad
lines
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
the
traffic
is
long
distance
traffic
that
it
can
not
pass
over
the
whole
distance
by
water
while
it
can
go
anywhere
by
rail
and
that
therefore
the
power
of
the
rail
lines
to
or
not
to
with
water
lines
really
determines
the
practical
value
of
a
river
channel
the
controlling
value
of
terminals
and
the
fact
that
out
of
fifty
of
our
leading
ports
over
half
the
active
water
frontage
in
ports
was
controlled
by
the
railroads
was
also
brought
to
the
commission
attention
and
reports
of
great
value
were
prepared
both
for
the
inland
waterways
commission
and
for
the
national
conservation
commission
in
addition
to
developing
the
basic
facts
about
the
available
timber
supply
about
waterways
water
power
and
iron
ore
smith
helped
to
develop
and
drive
into
the
public
conscience
the
idea
that
the
people
ought
to
retain
title
to
our
natural
resources
and
handle
them
by
the
leasing
system
the
things
accomplished
that
have
been
enumerated
above
were
of
immediate
consequence
to
the
economic
of
our
people
in
addition
certain
things
were
done
of
which
the
economic
bearing
was
more
remote
but
which
bore
directly
upon
our
welfare
because
they
add
to
the
beauty
of
living
and
therefore
to
the
joy
of
life
securing
a
great
artist
to
give
us
the
most
beautiful
coinage
since
the
decay
of
hellenistic
greece
was
one
such
act
in
this
case
i
had
power
myself
to
direct
the
mint
to
employ
the
first
and
most
beautiful
of
his
coins
were
issued
in
thousands
before
congress
assembled
or
could
intervene
and
a
great
and
permanent
improvement
was
made
in
the
beauty
of
the
coinage
in
the
same
way
on
the
advice
and
suggestion
of
frank
millet
we
got
some
really
capital
medals
by
sculptors
of
the
first
rank
similarly
the
new
buildings
in
washington
were
erected
and
placed
in
proper
relation
to
one
another
on
plans
provided
by
the
best
architects
and
landscape
architects
i
also
appointed
a
fine
arts
council
an
unpaid
body
of
the
best
architects
painters
and
sculptors
in
the
country
to
advise
the
government
as
to
the
erection
and
decoration
of
all
new
buildings
the
senators
and
congressmen
felt
for
this
body
an
instinctive
and
perhaps
from
their
standpoint
a
natural
hostility
and
my
successor
a
couple
of
months
after
taking
office
revoked
the
appointment
and
disbanded
the
council
even
more
important
was
the
taking
of
steps
to
preserve
from
destruction
beautiful
and
wonderful
wild
creatures
whose
existence
was
threatened
by
greed
and
wantonness
during
the
seven
and
a
half
years
closing
on
march
more
was
accomplished
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
in
the
united
states
than
during
all
the
previous
years
excepting
only
the
creation
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
the
record
includes
the
creation
of
five
national
parks
crater
lake
oregon
wind
cave
south
dakota
platt
oklahoma
sully
hill
north
dakota
and
mesa
verde
colorado
four
big
game
refuges
in
oklahoma
arizona
montana
and
washington
bird
reservations
and
the
enactment
of
laws
for
the
protection
of
wild
life
in
alaska
the
district
of
columbia
and
on
national
bird
reserves
these
measures
may
be
briefly
enumerated
as
follows
the
enactment
of
the
first
game
laws
for
the
territory
of
alaska
in
and
resulting
in
the
regulation
of
the
export
of
heads
and
trophies
of
big
game
and
putting
an
end
to
the
slaughter
of
deer
for
hides
along
the
southern
coast
of
the
territory
the
securing
in
of
the
first
appropriation
for
the
preservation
of
buffalo
and
the
establishment
in
the
yellowstone
national
park
of
the
first
and
now

chapter

the
big
stick
and
the
square
deal
one
of
the
vital
questions
with
which
as
president
i
had
to
deal
was
the
attitude
of
the
nation
toward
the
great
corporations
men
who
understand
and
practice
the
deep
underlying
philosophy
of
the
lincoln
school
of
american
political
thought
are
necessarily
hamiltonian
in
their
belief
in
a
strong
and
efficient
national
government
and
jeffersonian
in
their
belief
in
the
people
as
the
ultimate
authority
and
in
the
welfare
of
the
people
as
the
end
of
government
the
men
who
first
applied
the
extreme
democratic
theory
in
american
life
were
like
jefferson
ultra
individualists
for
at
that
time
what
was
demanded
by
our
people
was
the
largest
liberty
for
the
individual
during
the
century
that
had
elapsed
since
jefferson
became
president
the
need
had
been
exactly
reversed
there
had
been
in
our
country
a
riot
of
individualistic
materialism
under
which
complete
freedom
for
the
individual
that
ancient
license
which
president
wilson
a
century
after
the
term
was
excusable
has
called
the
new
freedom
turned
out
in
practice
to
mean
perfect
freedom
for
the
strong
to
wrong
the
weak
the
total
absence
of
governmental
control
had
led
to
a
portentous
growth
in
the
financial
and
industrial
world
both
of
natural
individuals
and
of
artificial
individuals
that
is
corporations
in
no
other
country
in
the
world
had
such
enormous
fortunes
been
gained
in
no
other
country
in
the
world
was
such
power
held
by
the
men
who
had
gained
these
fortunes
and
these
men
almost
always
worked
through
and
by
means
of
the
giant
corporations
which
they
controlled
the
power
of
the
mighty
industrial
overlords
of
the
country
had
increased
with
giant
strides
while
the
methods
of
controlling
them
or
checking
abuses
by
them
on
the
part
of
the
people
through
the
government
remained
archaic
and
therefore
practically
impotent
the
courts
not
unnaturally
but
most
regrettably
and
to
the
grave
detriment
of
the
people
and
of
their
own
standing
had
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
been
on
the
whole
the
agents
of
reaction
and
by
conflicting
decisions
which
however
in
their
sum
were
hostile
to
the
interests
of
the
people
had
left
both
the
nation
and
the
several
states
impotent
to
deal
with
the
great
business
combinations
sometimes
they
forbade
the
nation
to
interfere
because
such
interference
trespassed
on
the
rights
of
the
states
sometimes
they
forbade
the
states
to
interfere
and
often
they
were
wise
in
this
because
to
do
so
would
trespass
on
the
rights
of
the
nation
but
always
or
always
their
action
was
negative
action
against
the
interests
of
the
people
ingeniously
devised
to
limit
their
power
against
wrong
instead
of
affirmative
action
giving
to
the
people
power
to
right
wrong
they
had
rendered
these
decisions
sometimes
as
upholders
of
property
rights
against
human
rights
being
especially
zealous
in
securing
the
rights
of
the
very
men
who
were
most
competent
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
sometimes
in
the
name
of
liberty
in
the
name
of
the
new
freedom
in
reality
the
old
old
freedom
which
secured
to
the
powerful
the
freedom
to
prey
on
the
poor
and
the
helpless
one
of
the
main
troubles
was
the
fact
that
the
men
who
saw
the
evils
and
who
tried
to
remedy
them
attempted
to
work
in
two
wholly
different
ways
and
the
great
majority
of
them
in
a
way
that
offered
little
promise
of
real
betterment
they
tried
by
the
sherman
law
method
to
bolster
up
an
individualism
already
proved
to
be
both
futile
and
mischievous
to
remedy
by
more
individualism
the
concentration
that
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
already
existing
individualism
they
saw
the
evil
done
by
the
big
combinations
and
sought
to
remedy
it
by
destroying
them
and
restoring
the
country
to
the
economic
conditions
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
this
was
a
hopeless
effort
and
those
who
went
into
it
although
they
regarded
themselves
as
radical
progressives
really
represented
a
form
of
sincere
rural
toryism
they
confounded
monopolies
with
big
business
combinations
and
in
the
effort
to
prohibit
both
alike
instead
of
where
possible
prohibiting
one
and
drastically
controlling
the
other
they
succeeded
merely
in
preventing
any
effective
control
of
either
on
the
other
hand
a
few
men
recognized
that
corporations
and
combinations
had
become
indispensable
in
the
business
world
that
it
was
folly
to
try
to
prohibit
them
but
that
it
was
also
folly
to
leave
them
without
thoroughgoing
control
these
men
realized
that
the
doctrines
of
the
old
laissez
faire
economists
of
the
believers
in
unlimited
competition
unlimited
individualism
were
in
the
actual
state
of
affairs
false
and
mischievous
they
realized
that
the
government
must
now
interfere
to
protect
labor
to
subordinate
the
big
corporation
to
the
public
welfare
and
to
shackle
cunning
and
fraud
exactly
as
centuries
before
it
had
interfered
to
shackle
the
physical
force
which
does
wrong
by
violence
the
big
reactionaries
of
the
business
world
and
their
allies
and
instruments
among
politicians
and
newspaper
editors
took
advantage
of
this
division
of
opinion
and
especially
of
the
fact
that
most
of
their
opponents
were
on
the
wrong
path
and
fought
to
keep
matters
absolutely
unchanged
these
men
demanded
for
themselves
an
immunity
from
governmental
control
which
if
granted
would
have
been
as
wicked
and
as
foolish
as
immunity
to
the
barons
of
the
twelfth
century
many
of
them
were
evil
men
many
others
were
just
as
good
men
as
were
some
of
these
same
barons
but
they
were
as
utterly
unable
as
any
medieval
to
understand
what
the
public
interest
really
was
there
have
been
aristocracies
which
have
played
a
great
and
beneficent
part
at
stages
in
the
growth
of
mankind
but
we
had
come
to
the
stage
where
for
our
people
what
was
needed
was
a
real
democracy
and
of
all
forms
of
tyranny
the
least
attractive
and
the
most
vulgar
is
the
tyranny
of
mere
wealth
the
tyranny
of
a
plutocracy
when
i
became
president
the
question
as
to
the
method
by
which
the
united
states
government
was
to
control
the
corporations
was
not
yet
important
the
absolutely
vital
question
was
whether
the
government
had
power
to
control
them
at
all
this
question
had
not
yet
been
decided
in
favor
of
the
united
states
government
it
was
useless
to
discuss
methods
of
controlling
big
business
by
the
national
government
until
it
was
definitely
settled
that
the
national
government
had
the
power
to
control
it
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
had
with
seeming
definiteness
settled
that
the
national
government
had
not
the
power
this
decision
i
caused
to
be
annulled
by
the
court
that
had
rendered
it
and
the
present
power
of
the
national
government
to
deal
effectively
with
the
trusts
is
due
solely
to
the
success
of
the
administration
in
securing
this
reversal
of
its
former
decision
by
the
supreme
court
the
constitution
was
formed
very
largely
because
it
had
become
imperative
to
give
to
some
central
authority
the
power
to
regulate
and
control
interstate
commerce
at
that
time
when
corporations
were
in
their
infancy
and
big
combinations
unknown
there
was
no
difficulty
in
exercising
the
power
granted
in
theory
the
right
of
the
nation
to
exercise
this
power
continued
unquestioned
but
changing
conditions
obscured
the
matter
in
the
sight
of
the
people
as
a
whole
and
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
advocates
of
an
unlimited
and
uncontrollable
capitalism
gradually
secured
the
whittling
away
of
the
national
power
to
exercise
this
theoretical
right
of
control
until
it
practically
vanished
after
the
civil
war
with
the
portentous
growth
of
industrial
combinations
in
this
country
came
a
period
of
reactionary
decisions
by
the
courts
which
as
regards
corporations
culminated
in
what
is
known
as
the
knight
case
the
sherman
law
was
enacted
in
because
the
formation
of
the
tobacco
trust
and
the
sugar
trust
the
only
two
great
trusts
then
in
the
country
aside
from
the
standard
oil
trust
which
was
a
gradual
growth
had
awakened
a
popular
demand
for
legislation
to
destroy
monopoly
and
curb
industrial
combinations
this
demand
the
law
was
intended
to
satisfy
the
administrations
of
harrison
and
cleveland
evidently
construed
this
law
as
prohibiting
such
combinations
in
the
future
not
as
condemning
those
which
had
been
formed
prior
to
its
enactment
in
however
the
sugar
trust
whose
output
originally
was
about
per
cent
of
all
sugar
produced
in
the
united
states
obtained
control
of
three
other
companies
in
philadelphia
by
exchanging
its
stock
for
theirs
and
thus
increased
its
business
until
it
controlled
per
cent
of
the
entire
product
under
cleveland
the
government
brought
proceedings
against
the
sugar
trust
invoking
the
law
to
set
aside
the
acquisition
of
these
corporations
the
test
case
was
on
the
absorption
of
the
knight
company
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
with
but
one
dissenting
vote
held
adversely
to
the
government
they
took
the
ground
that
the
power
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
regulate
and
control
interstate
commerce
did
not
extend
to
the
production
or
manufacture
of
commodities
within
a
state
and
that
nothing
in
the
sherman
law
prohibited
a
corporation
from
acquiring
all
the
stock
of
other
corporations
through
exchange
of
its
stock
for
theirs
such
exchange
not
being
commerce
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
even
though
by
such
acquisition
the
corporation
was
enabled
to
control
the
entire
production
of
a
commodity
that
was
a
necessary
of
life
the
effect
of
this
decision
was
not
merely
the
absolute
nullification
of
the
law
so
far
as
industrial
corporations
were
concerned
but
was
also
in
effect
a
declaration
that
under
the
constitution
the
national
government
could
pass
no
law
really
effective
for
the
destruction
or
control
of
such
combinations
this
decision
left
the
national
government
that
is
the
people
of
the
nation
practically
helpless
to
deal
with
the
large
combinations
of
modern
business
the
courts
in
other
cases
asserted
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
enforce
the
law
so
far
as
transportation
rates
by
railways
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
were
concerned
but
so
long
as
the
trusts
were
free
to
control
the
production
of
commodities
without
interference
from
the
general
government
they
were
well
content
to
let
the
transportation
of
commodities
take
care
of
itself
especially
as
the
law
against
rebates
was
at
that
time
a
dead
letter
and
the
court
by
its
decision
in
the
knight
case
had
interdicted
any
interference
by
the
president
or
by
congress
with
the
production
of
commodities
it
was
on
the
authority
of
this
case
that
practically
all
the
big
trusts
in
the
united
states
excepting
those
already
mentioned
were
formed
usually
they
were
organized
as
holding
companies
each
one
acquiring
control
of
its
constituent
corporations
by
exchanging
its
stock
for
theirs
an
operation
which
the
supreme
court
had
thus
decided
could
not
be
prohibited
controlled
regulated
or
even
questioned
by
the
federal
government
such
was
the
condition
of
our
laws
when
i
acceded
to
the
presidency
just
before
my
accession
a
small
group
of
financiers
desiring
to
profit
by
the
governmental
impotence
to
which
we
had
been
reduced
by
the
knight
decision
had
arranged
to
take
control
of
practically
the
entire
railway
system
in
the
northwest
possibly
as
the
first
step
toward
controlling
the
entire
railway
system
of
the
country
this
control
of
the
northwestern
railway
systems
was
to
be
effected
by
organizing
a
new
holding
company
and
exchanging
its
stock
against
the
stock
of
the
various
corporations
engaged
in
railway
transportation
throughout
that
vast
territory
exactly
as
the
sugar
trust
had
acquired
control
of
the
knight
company
and
other
concerns
this
company
was
called
the
northern
securities
company
not
long
after
i
became
president
on
the
advice
of
the
knox
and
through
him
i
ordered
proceedings
to
be
instituted
for
the
dissolution
of
the
company
as
far
as
could
be
told
by
their
utterances
at
the
time
among
all
the
great
lawyers
in
the
united
states
knox
was
the
only
one
who
believed
that
this
action
could
be
sustained
the
defense
was
based
expressly
on
the
ground
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
knight
case
had
explicitly
sanctioned
the
formation
of
such
a
company
as
the
northern
securities
company
the
representatives
of
privilege
intimated
and
sometimes
asserted
outright
that
in
directing
the
action
to
be
brought
i
had
shown
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
supreme
court
which
had
already
decided
the
question
at
issue
by
a
vote
of
eight
to
one
justice
white
then
on
the
court
and
now
chief
justice
set
forth
the
position
that
the
two
cases
were
in
principle
identical
with
incontrovertible
logic
in
giving
the
views
of
the
dissenting
minority
on
the
action
i
had
brought
he
said
the
parallel
between
the
two
cases
the
knight
case
and
the
northern
securities
case
is
complete
the
one
corporation
acquired
the
stock
of
other
and
competing
corporations
in
exchange
for
its
own
it
was
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
the
case
that
in
doing
so
monopoly
had
been
brought
about
in
the
refining
of
sugar
that
the
sugar
to
be
produced
was
likely
to
become
the
subject
of
interstate
commerce
and
indeed
that
part
of
it
would
certainly
become
so
but
the
power
of
congress
was
decided
not
to
extend
to
the
subject
because
the
ownership
of
the
stock
in
the
corporations
was
not
itself
commerce
justice
white
was
entirely
correct
in
this
statement
the
cases
were
parallel
it
was
necessary
to
reverse
the
knight
case
in
the
interests
of
the
people
against
monopoly
and
privilege
just
as
it
had
been
necessary
to
reverse
the
dred
scott
case
in
the
interest
of
the
people
against
slavery
and
privilege
just
as
later
it
became
necessary
to
reverse
the
new
york
bakeshop
case
in
the
interest
of
the
people
against
that
form
of
monopolistic
privilege
which
put
human
rights
below
property
rights
where
wage
workers
were
concerned
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four
the
supreme
court
reversed
its
decision
in
the
knight
case
and
in
the
northern
securities
case
sustained
the
government
the
power
to
deal
with
industrial
monopoly
and
suppress
it
and
to
control
and
regulate
combinations
of
which
the
knight
case
had
deprived
the
federal
government
was
thus
restored
to
it
by
the
northern
securities
case
after
this
later
decision
was
rendered
suits
were
brought
by
my
direction
against
the
american
tobacco
company
and
the
standard
oil
company
both
were
adjudged
criminal
conspiracies
and
their
dissolution
ordered
the
knight
case
was
finally
overthrown
the
vicious
doctrine
it
embodied
no
longer
remains
as
an
obstacle
to
obstruct
the
pathway
of
justice
when
it
assails
monopoly
knox
moody
and
bonaparte
who
successively
occupied
the
position
of
under
me
were
profound
lawyers
and
fearless
and
able
men
and
they
completely
established
the
newer
and
more
wholesome
doctrine
under
which
the
federal
government
may
now
deal
with
monopolistic
combinations
and
conspiracies
the
decisions
rendered
in
these
various
cases
brought
under
my
direction
constitute
the
entire
authority
upon
which
any
action
must
rest
that
seeks
through
the
exercise
of
national
power
to
curb
monopolistic
control
the
men
who
organized
and
directed
the
northern
securities
company
were
also
the
controlling
forces
in
the
steel
corporation
which
has
since
been
prosecuted
under
the
act
the
proceedings
against
the
sugar
trust
for
corruption
in
connection
with
the
new
york
custom
house
are
sufficiently
interesting
to
be
considered
separately
from
the
standpoint
of
giving
complete
control
to
the
national
government
over
big
corporations
engaged
in
business
it
would
be
impossible
to
the
importance
of
the
northern
securities
decision
and
of
the
decisions
afterwards
rendered
in
line
with
it
in
connection
with
the
other
trusts
whose
dissolution
was
ordered
the
success
of
the
northern
securities
case
definitely
established
the
power
of
the
government
to
deal
with
all
great
corporations
without
this
success
the
national
government
must
have
remained
in
the
impotence
to
which
it
had
been
reduced
by
the
knight
decision
as
regards
the
most
important
of
its
internal
functions
but
our
success
in
establishing
the
power
of
the
national
government
to
curb
monopolies
did
not
establish
the
right
method
of
exercising
that
power
we
had
gained
the
power
we
had
not
devised
the
proper
method
of
exercising
it
monopolies
can
although
in
rather
cumbrous
fashion
be
broken
up
by
law
suits
great
business
combinations
however
can
not
possibly
be
made
useful
instead
of
noxious
industrial
agencies
merely
by
law
suits
and
especially
by
law
suits
supposed
to
be
carried
on
for
their
destruction
and
not
for
their
control
and
regulation
i
at
once
began
to
urge
upon
congress
the
need
of
laws
supplementing
the
law
for
this
law
struck
at
all
big
business
good
and
bad
alike
and
as
the
event
proved
was
very
inefficient
in
checking
bad
big
business
and
yet
was
a
constant
threat
against
decent
business
men
i
strongly
urged
the
inauguration
of
a
system
of
thoroughgoing
and
drastic
governmental
regulation
and
control
over
all
big
business
combinations
engaged
in
industry
here
i
was
able
to
accomplish
only
a
small
part
of
what
i
desired
to
accomplish
i
was
opposed
both
by
the
foolish
radicals
who
desired
to
break
up
all
big
business
with
the
impossible
ideal
of
returning
to
century
industrial
conditions
and
also
by
the
great
privileged
interests
themselves
who
used
these
ordinarily
but
sometimes
not
entirely
stool
pigeon
progressives
to
further
their
own
cause
the
worst
representatives
of
big
business
encouraged
the
outcry
for
the
total
abolition
of
big
business
because
they
knew
that
they
could
not
be
hurt
in
this
way
and
that
such
an
outcry
distracted
the
attention
of
the
public
from
the
really
efficient
method
of
controlling
and
supervising
them
in
just
but
masterly
fashion
which
was
advocated
by
the
sane
representatives
of
reform
however
we
succeeded
in
making
a
good
beginning
by
securing
the
passage
of
a
law
creating
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
and
with
it
the
erection
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
the
first
head
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
was
cortelyou
later
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
was
succeeded
by
oscar
straus
the
first
head
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
was
garfield
who
was
succeeded
by
herbert
knox
smith
no
four
better
public
servants
from
the
standpoint
of
the
people
as
a
whole
could
have
been
found
the
standard
oil
company
took
the
lead
in
opposing
all
this
legislation
this
was
natural
for
it
had
been
the
worst
offender
in
the
amassing
of
enormous
fortunes
by
improper
methods
of
all
kinds
at
the
expense
of
business
rivals
and
of
the
public
including
the
corruption
of
public
servants
if
any
man
thinks
this
condemnation
extreme
i
refer
him
to
the
language
officially
used
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
nation
in
its
decision
against
the
standard
oil
company
through
their
counsel
and
by
direct
telegrams
and
letters
to
senators
and
congressmen
from
various
heads
of
the
standard
oil
organization
they
did
their
best
to
kill
the
bill
providing
for
the
bureau
of
corporations
i
got
hold
of
one
or
two
of
these
telegrams
and
letters
however
and
promptly
published
them
and
as
generally
happens
in
such
a
case
the
men
who
were
as
long
as
they
could
work
in
secret
and
behind
closed
doors
became
powerless
as
soon
as
they
were
forced
into
the
open
the
bill
went
through
without
further
difficulty
the
true
way
of
dealing
with
monopoly
is
to
prevent
it
by
administrative
action
before
it
grows
so
powerful
that
even
when
courts
condemn
it
they
shrink
from
destroying
it
the
supreme
court
in
the
tobacco
and
standard
oil
cases
for
instance
used
very
vigorous
language
in
condemning
these
trusts
but
the
net
result
of
the
decision
was
of
positive
advantage
to
the
wrongdoers
and
this
has
tended
to
bring
the
whole
body
of
our
law
into
disrepute
in
quarters
where
it
is
of
the
very
highest
importance
that
the
law
be
held
in
respect
and
even
in
reverence
my
effort
was
to
secure
the
creation
of
a
federal
commission
which
should
neither
excuse
nor
tolerate
monopoly
but
prevent
it
when
possible
and
uproot
it
when
discovered
and
which
should
in
addition
effectively
control
and
regulate
all
big
combinations
and
should
give
honest
business
certainty
as
to
what
the
law
was
and
security
as
long
as
the
law
was
obeyed
such
a
commission
would
furnish
a
steady
expert
control
a
control
adapted
to
the
problem
and
dissolution
is
neither
control
nor
regulation
but
is
purely
negative
and
negative
remedies
are
of
little
permanent
avail
such
a
commission
would
have
complete
power
to
examine
into
every
big
corporation
engaged
or
proposing
to
engage
in
business
between
the
states
it
would
have
the
power
to
discriminate
sharply
between
corporations
that
are
doing
well
and
those
that
are
doing
ill
and
the
distinction
between
those
who
do
well
and
those
who
do
ill
would
be
defined
in
terms
so
clear
and
unmistakable
that
no
one
could
misapprehend
them
where
a
company
is
found
seeking
its
profits
through
serving
the
community
by
stimulating
production
lowering
prices
or
improving
service
while
scrupulously
respecting
the
rights
of
others
including
its
rivals
its
employees
its
customers
and
the
general
public
and
strictly
obeying
the
law
then
no
matter
how
large
its
capital
or
how
great
the
volume
of
its
business
it
would
be
encouraged
to
still
more
abundant
production
or
better
service
by
the
fullest
protection
that
the
government
could
afford
it
on
the
other
hand
if
a
corporation
were
found
seeking
profit
through
injury
or
oppression
of
the
community
by
restricting
production
through
trick
or
device
by
plot
or
conspiracy
against
competitors
or
by
oppression
of
and
then
extorting
high
prices
for
the
commodity
it
had
made
artificially
scarce
it
would
be
prevented
from
organizing
if
its
nefarious
purpose
could
be
discovered
in
time
or
pursued
and
suppressed
by
all
the
power
of
government
whenever
found
in
actual
operation
such
a
commission
with
the
power
i
advocate
would
put
a
stop
to
abuses
of
big
corporations
and
small
corporations
alike
it
would
draw
the
line
on
conduct
and
not
on
size
it
would
destroy
monopoly
and
make
the
biggest
business
man
in
the
country
conform
squarely
to
the
principles
laid
down
by
the
american
people
while
at
the
same
time
giving
fair
play
to
the
little
man
and
certainty
of
knowledge
as
to
what
was
wrong
and
what
was
right
both
to
big
man
and
little
man
although
under
the
decision
of
the
courts
the
national
government
had
power
over
the
railways
i
found
when
i
became
president
that
this
power
was
either
not
exercised
at
all
or
exercised
with
utter
inefficiency
the
law
against
rebates
was
a
dead
letter
all
the
unscrupulous
railway
men
had
been
allowed
to
violate
it
with
impunity
and
because
of
this
as
was
inevitable
the
scrupulous
and
decent
railway
men
had
been
forced
to
violate
it
themselves
under
penalty
of
being
beaten
by
their
less
scrupulous
rivals
it
was
not
the
fault
of
these
decent
railway
men
it
was
the
fault
of
the
government
thanks
to
a
railway
man
paul
morton
of
the
santa
fe
son
of
cleveland
secretary
of
agriculture
i
was
able
completely
to
stop
the
practice
morton
volunteered
to
aid
the
government
in
abolishing
rebates
he
frankly
stated
that
he
like
every
one
else
had
been
guilty
in
the
matter
but
he
insisted
that
he
uttered
the
sentiments
of
the
decent
railway
men
of
the
country
when
he
said
that
he
hoped
the
practice
would
be
stopped
and
that
if
i
would
really
stop
it
and
not
merely
make
believe
to
stop
it
he
would
give
the
testimony
which
would
put
into
the
hands
of
the
government
the
power
to
put
a
complete
check
to
the
practice
accordingly
he
testified
and
on
the
information
which
he
gave
us
we
were
able
to
take
such
action
through
the
commerce
commission
and
the
department
of
justice
supplemented
by
the
necessary
additional
legislation
that
the
evil
was
absolutely
eradicated
he
thus
rendered
of
his
own
accord
at
his
own
personal
risk
and
from
purely
disinterested
motives
an
invaluable
service
to
the
people
a
service
which
no
other
man
who
was
able
to
render
was
willing
to
render
as
an
immediate
sequel
the
alliance
between
blifil
and
black
george
was
immediately
revived
against
paul
morton
in
giving
rebates
he
had
done
only
what
every
honest
railway
man
in
the
country
had
been
obliged
to
do
because
of
the
failure
of
the
government
to
enforce
the
prohibition
as
regards
dishonest
railway
men
but
unlike
his
fellows
he
had
then
shown
the
courage
and
sense
of
obligation
to
the
public
which
made
him
come
forward
and
without
evasion
or
concealment
state
what
he
had
done
in
order
that
we
might
successfully
put
an
end
to
the
practice
and
put
an
end
to
the
practice
we
did
and
we
did
it
because
of
the
courage
and
patriotism
he
had
shown
the
unscrupulous
railway
men
whose
dishonest
practices
were
thereby
put
a
stop
to
and
the
unscrupulous
demagogues
who
were
either
under
the
influence
of
these
men
or
desirous
of
gaining
credit
with
thoughtless
and
ignorant
people
no
matter
who
was
hurt
joined
in
vindictive
clamor
against
morton
they
actually
wished
me
to
prosecute
him
although
such
prosecution
would
have
been
a
piece
of
unpardonable
ingratitude
and
treachery
on
the
part
of
the
public
toward
him
for
i
was
merely
acting
as
the
steward
of
the
public
in
this
matter
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
stood
by
him
and
later
he
served
under
me
as
secretary
of
the
navy
and
a
capital
secretary
he
made
too
we
not
only
secured
the
stopping
of
rebates
but
in
the
hepburn
rate
bill
we
were
able
to
put
through
a
measure
which
gave
the
commerce
commission
for
the
first
time
real
control
over
the
railways
there
were
two
or
three
amusing
features
in
the
contest
over
this
bill
all
of
the
great
business
interests
which
objected
to
governmental
control
banded
to
fight
it
and
they
were
helped
by
the
honest
men
of
type
who
always
dread
change
whether
good
or
bad
we
finally
forced
it
through
the
house
in
the
senate
it
was
referred
to
a
committee
in
which
the
republican
majority
was
under
the
control
of
senator
aldrich
who
took
the
lead
in
opposing
the
bill
there
was
one
republican
on
the
committee
however
whom
senator
aldrich
could
not
control
senator
dolliver
of
iowa
the
leading
democrat
on
the
committee
was
senator
tillman
of
south
carolina
with
whom
i
was
not
on
good
terms
because
i
had
been
obliged
to
cancel
an
invitation
to
him
to
dine
at
the
white
house
on
account
of
his
having
made
a
personal
assault
in
the
senate
chamber
on
his
colleague
from
south
carolina
and
later
i
had
to
take
action
against
him
on
account
of
his
conduct
in
connection
with
certain
land
matters
senator
tillman
favored
the
bill
the
republican
majority
in
the
committee
under
senator
aldrich
when
they
acted
adversely
on
the
bill
turned
it
over
to
senator
tillman
thereby
making
him
its
sponsor
the
object
was
to
create
what
it
was
hoped
would
be
an
impossible
situation
in
view
of
the
relations
between
senator
tillman
and
myself
i
regarded
the
action
as
simply
childish
it
was
a
curious
instance
of
how
able
and
astute
men
sometimes
commit
blunders
because
of
sheer
inability
to
understand
intensity
of
disinterested
motive
in
others
i
did
not
care
a
rap
about
tillman
getting
credit
for
the
bill
or
having
charge
of
it
i
was
delighted
to
go
with
him
or
with
any
one
else
just
so
long
as
he
was
traveling
in
my
way
and
no
longer
there
was
another
amusing
incident
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
the
bill
all
the
wise
friends
of
the
effort
to
secure
governmental
control
of
corporations
know
that
this
government
control
must
be
exercised
through
administrative
and
not
judicial
officers
if
it
is
to
be
effective
everything
possible
should
be
done
to
minimize
the
chance
of
appealing
from
the
decisions
of
the
administrative
officer
to
the
courts
but
it
is
not
possible
constitutionally
and
probably
would
not
be
desirable
anyhow
completely
to
abolish
the
appeal
unwise
zealots
wished
to
make
the
effort
totally
to
abolish
the
appeal
in
connection
with
the
hepburn
bill
representatives
of
the
special
interests
wished
to
extend
the
appeal
to
include
what
it
ought
not
to
include
between
stood
a
number
of
men
whose
votes
would
mean
the
passage
of
or
the
failure
to
pass
the
bill
and
who
were
not
inclined
towards
either
side
three
or
four
substantially
identical
amendments
were
proposed
and
we
then
suddenly
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
an
absurd
situation
the
good
men
who
were
willing
to
go
with
us
but
had
conservative
misgivings
about
the
would
not
accept
a
good
amendment
if
one
of
the
latter
proposed
it
and
the
radicals
would
not
accept
their
own
amendment
if
one
of
the
conservatives
proposed
it
each
side
got
so
wrought
up
as
to
be
utterly
unable
to
get
matters
into
proper
perspective
each
prepared
to
stand
on
unimportant
trifles
each
announced
with
hysterical
emphasis
the
reformers
just
as
hysterically
as
the
reactionaries
that
the
decision
as
regards
each
unimportant
trifle
determined
the
worth
or
worthlessness
of
the
measure
gradually
we
secured
a
measurable
return
to
sane
appreciation
of
the
essentials
finally
both
sides
reluctantly
agreed
to
accept
the
allison
amendment
which
did
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
work
any
change
in
the
bill
at
all
the
amendment
was
drawn
by
moody
after
consultation
with
the
commerce
commission
and
was
forwarded
by
me
to
senator
dolliver
it
was
accepted
and
the
bill
became
law
thanks
to
this
law
and
to
the
way
in
which
the
commerce
commission
was
backed
by
the
administration
the
commission
under
men
like
prouty
lane
and
clark
became
a
most
powerful
force
for
good
some
of
the
good
that
we
had
accomplished
was
undone
after
the
close
of
my
administration
by
the
unfortunate
law
creating
a
commerce
court
but
the
major
part
of
the
immense
advance
we
had
made
remained
there
was
one
point
on
which
i
insisted
and
upon
which
it
is
necessary
always
to
insist
the
commission
can
not
do
permanent
good
unless
it
does
justice
to
the
corporations
precisely
as
it
exacts
justice
from
them
the
public
the
shippers
the
stock
and
bondholders
and
the
employees
all
have
their
rights
and
none
should
be
allowed
unfair
privileges
at
the
expense
of
the
others
stock
watering
and
swindling
of
any
kind
should
of
course
not
only
be
stopped
but
punished
when
however
a
road
is
managed
fairly
and
honestly
and
when
it
renders
a
real
and
needed
service
then
the
government
must
see
that
it
is
not
so
burdened
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
run
it
at
a
profit
there
is
much
wise
legislation
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
public
or
like
compensation
necessary
to
the
of
the
employee
which
nevertheless
imposes
such
a
burden
on
the
road
that
the
burden
must
be
distributed
between
the
general
public
and
the
corporation
or
there
will
be
no
dividends
in
such
a
case
it
may
be
the
highest
duty
of
the
commission
to
raise
rates
and
the
commission
when
satisfied
that
the
necessity
exists
in
order
to
do
justice
to
the
owners
of
the
road
should
no
more
hesitate
to
raise
rates
than
under
other
circumstances
to
lower
them
so
much
for
the
big
stick
in
dealing
with
the
corporations
when
they
went
wrong
now
for
a
sample
of
the
square
deal
in
the
fall
of
there
were
severe
business
disturbances
and
financial
stringency
culminating
in
a
panic
which
arose
in
new
york
and
spread
over
the
country
the
damage
actually
done
was
great
and
the
damage
threatened
was
incalculable
thanks
largely
to
the
action
of
the
government
the
panic
was
stopped
before
instead
of
being
merely
a
serious
business
check
it
became
a
frightful
and
calamity
a
disaster
fraught
with
untold
misery
and
woe
to
all
our
people
for
several
days
the
nation
trembled
on
the
brink
of
such
a
calamity
of
such
a
disaster
during
these
days
both
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
i
personally
were
in
hourly
communication
with
new
york
following
every
change
in
the
situation
and
trying
to
anticipate
every
development
it
was
the
obvious
duty
of
the
administration
to
take
every
step
possible
to
prevent
appalling
disaster
by
checking
the
spread
of
the
panic
before
it
grew
so
that
nothing
could
check
it
and
events
moved
with
such
speed
that
it
was
necessary
to
decide
and
to
act
on
the
instant
as
each
successive
crisis
arose
if
the
decision
and
action
were
to
accomplish
anything
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
took
various
actions
some
on
his
own
initiative
some
by
my
direction
late
one
evening
i
was
informed
that
two
representatives
of
the
steel
corporation
wished
to
see
me
early
the
following
morning
the
precise
object
not
being
named
next
morning
while
at
breakfast
i
was
informed
that
frick
and
gary
were
waiting
at
the
office
i
at
once
went
over
and
as
the
bonaparte
had
not
yet
arrived
from
baltimore
where
he
had
been
passing
the
night
i
sent
a
message
asking
the
secretary
of
state
root
who
was
also
a
lawyer
to
join
us
which
he
did
before
the
close
of
the
interview
and
in
the
presence
of
the
three
gentlemen
named
i
dictated
a
note
to
bonaparte
setting
forth
exactly
what
frick
and
gary
had
proposed
and
exactly
what
i
had
answered
so
that
there
might
be
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
this
note
was
published
in
a
senate
document
while
i
was
still
president
it
runs
as
follows
the
white
house
washington
november
my
dear
judge
gary
and
frick
on
behalf
of
the
steel
corporation
have
just
called
upon
me
they
state
that
there
is
a
certain
business
firm
the
name
of
which
i
have
not
been
told
but
which
is
of
real
importance
in
new
york
business
circles
which
will
undoubtedly
fail
this
week
if
help
is
not
given
among
its
assets
are
a
majority
of
the
securities
of
the
tennessee
coal
company
application
has
been
urgently
made
to
the
steel
corporation
to
purchase
this
stock
as
the
only
means
of
avoiding
a
failure
judge
gary
and
frick
informed
me
that
as
a
mere
business
transaction
they
do
not
care
to
purchase
the
stock
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
they
would
not
consider
purchasing
the
stock
because
but
little
benefit
will
come
to
the
steel
corporation
from
the
purchase
that
they
are
aware
that
the
purchase
will
be
used
as
a
handle
for
attack
upon
them
on
the
ground
that
they
are
striving
to
secure
a
monopoly
of
the
business
and
prevent
competition
not
that
this
would
represent
what
could
honestly
be
said
but
what
might
recklessly
and
untruthfully
be
said
they
further
informed
me
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
policy
of
the
company
has
been
to
decline
to
acquire
more
than
sixty
per
cent
of
the
steel
properties
and
that
this
purpose
has
been
persevered
in
for
several
years
past
with
the
object
of
preventing
these
accusations
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
their
proportion
of
steel
properties
has
slightly
decreased
so
that
it
is
below
this
sixty
per
cent
and
the
acquisition
of
the
property
in
question
will
not
raise
it
above
sixty
per
cent
but
they
feel
that
it
is
immensely
to
their
interest
as
to
the
interest
of
every
responsible
business
man
to
try
to
prevent
a
panic
and
general
industrial
at
this
time
and
that
they
are
willing
to
go
into
this
transaction
which
they
would
not
otherwise
go
into
because
it
seems
the
opinion
of
those
best
fitted
to
express
judgment
in
new
york
that
it
will
be
an
important
factor
in
preventing
a
break
that
might
be
ruinous
and
that
this
has
been
urged
upon
them
by
the
combination
of
the
most
responsible
bankers
in
new
york
who
are
now
thus
engaged
in
endeavoring
to
save
the
situation
but
they
asserted
that
they
did
not
wish
to
do
this
if
i
stated
that
it
ought
not
to
be
done
i
answered
that
while
of
course
i
could
not
advise
them
to
take
the
action
proposed
i
felt
it
no
public
duty
of
mine
to
interpose
any
objections

charles
bonaparte
bonaparte
received
this
note
in
about
an
hour
and
that
same
morning
he
came
over
acknowledged
its
receipt
and
said
that
my
answer
was
the
only
proper
answer
that
could
have
been
made
having
regard
both
to
the
law
and
to
the
needs
of
the
situation
he
stated
that
the
legal
situation
had
been
in
no
way
changed
and
that
no
sufficient
ground
existed
for
prosecution
of
the
steel
corporation
but
i
acted
purely
on
my
own
initiative
and
the
responsibility
for
the
act
was
solely
mine
i
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
situation
in
new
york
the
word
panic
means
fear
unreasoning
fear
to
stop
a
panic
it
is
necessary
to
restore
confidence
and
at
the
moment
the
morgan
interests
were
the
only
interests
which
retained
a
full
hold
on
the
confidence
of
the
people
of
new
york
not
only
the
business
people
but
the
immense
mass
of
men
and
women
who
owned
small
investments
or
had
small
savings
in
the
banks
and
trust
companies
morgan
and
his
associates
were
of
course
fighting
hard
to
prevent
the
loss
of
confidence
and
the
panic
distrust
from
increasing
to
such
a
degree
as
to
bring
any
other
big
financial
institutions
down
for
this
would
probably
have
been
followed
by
a
general
and
very
likely
a
worldwide
crash
the
knickerbocker
trust
company
had
already
failed
and
runs
had
begun
on
or
were
threatened
as
regards
two
other
big
trust
companies
these
companies
were
now
on
the
fighting
line
and
it
was
to
the
interest
of
everybody
to
strengthen
them
in
order
that
the
situation
might
be
saved
it
was
a
matter
of
general
knowledge
and
belief
that
they
or
the
individuals
prominent
in
them
held
the
securities
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
which
securities
had
no
market
value
and
were
useless
as
a
source
of
strength
in
the
emergency
the
steel
corporation
securities
on
the
contrary
were
immediately
marketable
their
great
value
being
known
and
admitted
all
over
the
world
as
the
event
showed
the
proposal
of
frick
and
gary
was
that
the
steel
corporation
should
at
once
acquire
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
and
thereby
substitute
among
the
assets
of
the
threatened
institutions
which
by
the
way
they
did
not
name
to
me
securities
of
great
and
immediate
value
for
securities
which
at
the
moment
were
of
no
value
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
decide
on
the
instant
before
the
stock
exchange
opened
for
the
situation
in
new
york
was
such
that
any
hour
might
be
vital
and
failure
to
act
for
even
an
hour
might
make
all
subsequent
effort
to
act
utterly
useless
from
the
best
information
at
my
disposal
i
believed
what
was
actually
the
fact
that
the
addition
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
property
would
only
increase
the
proportion
of
the
steel
holdings
by
about
four
per
cent
making
them
about
per
cent
instead
of
about
per
cent
of
the
total
value
in
the
country
an
addition
which
by
itself
in
my
judgment
concurred
in
not
only
by
the
but
by
every
competent
lawyer
worked
no
change
in
the
legal
status
of
the
steel
corporation
the
diminution
in
the
percentage
of
holdings
and
production
has
gone
on
steadily
and
the
percentage
is
now
about
ten
per
cent
less
than
it
was
ten
years
ago
the
action
was
emphatically
for
the
general
good
it
offered
the
only
chance
for
arresting
the
panic
and
it
did
arrest
the
panic
i
answered
frick
and
gary
as
set
forth
in
the
letter
quoted
above
to
the
effect
that
i
did
not
deem
it
my
duty
to
interfere
that
is
to
forbid
the
action
which
more
than
anything
else
in
actual
fact
saved
the
situation
the
result
justified
my
judgment
the
panic
was
stopped
public
confidence
in
the
solvency
of
the
threatened
institution
being
at
once
restored
business
was
vitally
helped
by
what
i
did
the
benefit
was
not
only
for
the
moment
it
was
permanent
particularly
was
this
the
case
in
the
south
three
or
four
years
afterwards
i
visited
birmingham
every
man
i
met
without
exception
who
was
competent
to
testify
informed
me
voluntarily
that
the
results
of
the
action
taken
had
been
of
the
utmost
benefit
to
birmingham
and
therefore
to
alabama
the
industry
having
profited
to
an
extraordinary
degree
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
the
business
but
from
the
standpoint
of
the
community
at
large
and
of
the
by
the
change
in
ownership
the
results
of
the
action
i
took
were
beneficial
from
every
standpoint
and
the
action
itself
at
the
time
when
it
was
taken
was
vitally
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
would
have
been
derelict
in
my
duty
i
would
have
shown
myself
a
timid
and
unworthy
public
servant
if
in
that
extraordinary
crisis
i
had
not
acted
precisely
as
i
did
act
in
every
such
crisis
the
temptation
to
indecision
to
is
great
for
excuses
can
always
be
found
for
and
action
means
risk
and
the
certainty
of
blame
to
the
man
who
acts
but
if
the
man
is
worth
his
salt
he
will
do
his
duty
he
will
give
the
people
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
act
in
any
way
which
their
interests
demand
and
which
is
not
affirmatively
prohibited
by
law
unheeding
the
likelihood
that
he
himself
when
the
crisis
is
over
and
the
danger
past
will
be
assailed
for
what
he
has
done
every
step
i
took
in
this
matter
was
open
as
the
day
and
was
known
in
detail
at
the
moment
to
all
people
the
press
contained
full
accounts
of
the
visit
to
me
of
frick
and
gary
and
heralded
widely
and
with
acclamation
the
results
of
that
visit
at
the
time
the
relief
and
rejoicing
over
what
had
been
done
were
universal
the
danger
was
too
imminent
and
too
appalling
for
me
to
be
willing
to
condemn
those
who
were
successful
in
saving
them
from
it
but
i
fully
understood
and
expected
that
when
there
was
no
longer
danger
when
the
fear
had
been
forgotten
attack
would
be
made
upon
me
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
a
year
had
elapsed
the
attack
was
begun
and
has
continued
at
intervals
ever
since
my
ordinary
assailant
being
some
politician
of
rather
cheap
type
if
i
were
on
a
i
should
not
ordinarily
meddle
with
any
of
the
gear
but
if
a
sudden
squall
struck
us
and
the
main
sheet
jammed
so
that
the
boat
threatened
to
capsize
i
would
unhesitatingly
cut
the
main
sheet
even
though
i
were
sure
that
the
owner
no
matter
how
grateful
to
me
at
the
moment
for
having
saved
his
life
would
a
few
weeks
later
when
he
had
forgotten
his
danger
and
his
fear
decide
to
sue
me
for
the
value
of
the
cut
rope
but
i
would
feel
a
hearty
contempt
for
the
owner
who
so
acted
there
were
many
other
things
that
we
did
in
connection
with
corporations
one
of
the
most
important
was
the
passage
of
the
meat
inspection
law
because
of
scandalous
abuses
shown
to
exist
in
the
great
in
chicago
and
elsewhere
there
was
a
curious
result
of
this
law
similar
to
what
occurred
in
connection
with
the
law
providing
for
effective
railway
regulation
the
big
beef
men
bitterly
opposed
the
law
just
as
the
big
railway
men
opposed
the
hepburn
act
yet
three
or
four
years
after
these
laws
had
been
put
on
the
statute
books
every
honest
man
both
in
the
beef
business
and
the
railway
business
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
worked
good
and
not
harm
to
the
decent
business
concerns
they
hurt
only
those
who
were
not
acting
as
they
should
have
acted
the
law
providing
for
the
inspection
of
and
the
pure
food
and
drugs
act
were
also
extremely
important
and
the
way
in
which
they
were
administered
was
even
more
important
it
would
be
hard
to
overstate
the
value
of
the
service
rendered
in
all
these
cases
by
such
cabinet
officers
as
moody
and
bonaparte
and
their
outside
assistants
of
the
stamp
of
frank
kellogg
it
would
be
useless
to
enumerate
all
the
suits
we
brought
some
of
them
i
have
already
touched
upon
others
such
as
the
suits
against
the
harriman
railway
corporations
which
were
successful
and
which
had
been
rendered
absolutely
necessary
by
the
grossly
improper
action
of
the
corporations
concerned
offered
no
special
points
of
interest
the
sugar
trust
proceedings
however
may
be
mentioned
as
showing
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
done
and
the
kind
of
obstacle
encountered
and
overcome
in
prosecutions
of
this
character
it
was
on
the
advice
of
my
secretary
william
loeb
afterward
head
of
the
new
york
that
the
action
was
taken
which
started
the
uncovering
of
the
frauds
perpetrated
by
the
sugar
trust
and
other
companies
in
connection
with
the
importing
of
sugar
loeb
had
from
time
to
time
told
me
that
he
was
sure
that
there
was
fraud
in
connection
with
the
importations
by
the
sugar
trust
through
the
new
york
finally
some
time
toward
the
end
of
he
informed
me
that
richard
parr
a
sampler
at
the
new
york
appraisers
stores
whose
duties
took
him
almost
continually
on
the
docks
in
connection
with
the
sampling
of
merchandise
had
called
on
him
and
had
stated
that
in
his
belief
the
sugar
companies
were
defrauding
the
government
in
the
matter
of
weights
and
had
stated
that
if
he
could
be
made
an
investigating
officer
of
the
treasury
department
he
was
confident
that
he
could
show
there
was
wrongdoing
parr
had
been
a
former
school
fellow
of
loeb
in
albany
and
loeb
believed
him
to
be
loyal
honest
and
efficient
he
thereupon
laid
the
matter
before
me
and
advised
the
appointment
of
parr
as
a
special
employee
of
the
treasury
department
for
the
specific
purpose
of
investigating
the
alleged
sugar
frauds
i
instructed
the
treasury
department
accordingly
and
was
informed
that
there
was
no
vacancy
in
the
force
of
special
employees
but
that
parr
would
be
given
the
first
place
that
opened
up
early
in
the
spring
of
parr
came
to
loeb
again
and
said
that
he
had
received
additional
information
about
the
sugar
frauds
and
was
anxious
to
begin
the
investigation
loeb
again
discussed
the
matter
with
me
and
i
notified
the
treasury
department
to
appoint
parr
immediately
on
june
he
received
his
appointment
and
was
assigned
to
the
port
of
boston
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
some
experience
as
an
investigating
officer
during
the
month
he
was
transferred
to
the
maine
district
with
headquarters
at
portland
where
he
remained
until
march
during
his
service
in
maine
he
uncovered
extensive
wool
smuggling
frauds
at
the
conclusion
of
the
wool
case
he
appealed
to
loeb
to
have
him
transferred
to
new
york
so
that
he
might
undertake
the
investigation
of
the
sugar
underweighing
frauds
i
now
called
the
attention
of
secretary
cortelyou
personally
to
the
matter
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
keep
a
check
over
any
subordinates
who
might
try
to
interfere
with
parr
for
the
conspiracy
was
evidently
widespread
the
wealth
of
the
offenders
great
and
the
corruption
in
the
service
while
moreover
as
always
happens
with
respectable
offenders
there
were
many
good
men
who
sincerely
disbelieved
in
the
possibility
of
corruption
on
the
part
of
men
of
such
high
financial
standing
parr
was
assigned
to
new
york
early
in
march
and
at
once
began
an
active
investigation
of
the
conditions
existing
on
the
sugar
docks
this
terminated
in
the
discovery
of
a
steel
spring
in
one
of
the
scales
of
the
havemeyer
elder
docks
in
brooklyn
november
which
enabled
us
to
uncover
what
were
probably
the
most
colossal
frauds
ever
perpetrated
in
the
customs
service
from
the
beginning
of
his
active
work
in
the
investigation
of
the
sugar
frauds
in
march
to
march
parr
from
time
to
time
personally
reported
to
loeb
at
the
white
house
the
progress
of
his
investigations
and
loeb
in
his
turn
kept
me
personally
advised
on
one
occasion
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
shunt
parr
off
the
investigation
and
substitute
another
agent
of
the
treasury
who
was
suspected
of
having
some
relations
with
the
sugar
companies
under
investigation
but
parr
reported
the
facts
to
loeb
i
sent
for
secretary
cortelyou
and
secretary
cortelyou
promptly
took
charge
of
the
matter
himself
putting
parr
back
on
the
investigation
during
the
investigation
parr
was
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
harassments
including
an
attempt
to
bribe
him
by
spitzer
the
dock
superintendent
of
the
havemeyer
elder
refinery
for
which
spitzer
was
convicted
and
served
a
term
in
prison
brzezinski
a
special
agent
who
was
assisting
parr
was
convicted
of
perjury
and
also
served
a
term
in
prison
he
having
changed
his
testimony
in
the
trial
of
spitzer
for
the
attempted
bribery
of
parr
from
that
which
he
gave
before
the
grand
jury
for
his
extraordinary
services
in
connection
with
this
investigation
parr
was
granted
an
award
of
by
the
treasury
department
stimson
of
new
york
assisted
by
denison
frankfurter
wise
and
other
employees
of
the
department
of
justice
took
charge
of
the
case
and
carried
on
both
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
the
trial
in
the
action
against
the
sugar
trust
for
the
recovery
of
duties
on
the
cargo
of
sugar
which
was
being
sent
over
the
scales
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
steel
spring
by
parr
was
begun
in
judgment
was
rendered
against
the
defendants
on
march
the
day
after
i
left
office
over
four
million
dollars
were
recovered
and
paid
back
into
the
united
states
treasury
by
the
sugar
companies
which
had
perpetrated
the
various
forms
of
fraud
these
frauds
were
unearthed
by
parr
loeb
stimson
frankfurter
and
the
other
men
mentioned
and
their
associates
and
it
was
to
them
that
the
people
owed
the
refunding
of
the
huge
sum
of
money
mentioned
we
had
already
secured
heavy
fines
from
the
sugar
trust
and
from
various
big
railways
and
private
individuals
such
as
edwin
earle
for
unlawful
rebates
in
the
case
of
the
chief
offender
the
american
sugar
refining
company
the
sugar
trust
criminal
prosecutions
were
carried
on
against
every
living
man
whose
position
was
such
that
he
would
naturally
know
about
the
fraud
all
of
them
were
indicted
and
the
biggest
and
most
responsible
ones
were
convicted
the
evidence
showed
that
the
president
of
the
company
henry
havemeyer
virtually
ran
the
entire
company
and
was
responsible
for
all
the
details
of
the
management
he
died
two
weeks
after
the
fraud
was
discovered
just
as
proceedings
were
being
begun
next
to
him
in
importance
was
the
secretary
and
treasurer
charles
heike
who
was
convicted
various
other
officials
and
employees
of
the
trust
and
various
government
employees
were
indicted
and
most
of
them
convicted
ernest
gerbracht
the
superintendent
of
one
of
the
refineries
was
convicted
but
his
sentence
was
commuted
to
a
short
jail
imprisonment
because
he
became
a
government
witness
and
greatly
assisted
the
government
in
the
suits
heike
sentence
was
commuted
so
as
to
excuse
him
from
going
to
the
penitentiary
just
as
the
penitentiary
sentence
of
morse
the
big
new
york
banker
who
was
convicted
of
gross
fraud
and
misapplication
of
funds
was
commuted
both
commutations
were
granted
long
after
i
left
office
in
each
case
the
commutation
was
granted
because
as
was
stated
of
the
prisoner
age
and
state
of
health
in
morse
case
the
president
originally
refused
the
request
saying
that
morse
had
exhibited
fraudulent
and
criminal
disregard
of
the
trust
imposed
upon
him
that
he
was
entirely
unscrupulous
as
to
the
methods
he
adopted
and
that
he
seemed
at
times
to
be
absolutely
heartless
with
regard
to
the
consequences
to
others
and
he
showed
great
shrewdness
in
obtaining
large
sums
of
money
from
the
bank
without
adequate
security
and
without
making
himself
personally
liable
therefor
the
two
cases
may
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
announcement
in
the
public
press
that
on
may
the
president
commuted
the
sentence
of
lewis
a
banks
who
was
serving
a
very
long
term
penitentiary
sentence
for
an
attack
on
a
girl
in
the
indian
territory
the
reason
for
the
commutation
which
is
set
forth
in
the
press
being
that
is
in
poor
health
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
balance
the
claims
of
justice
and
mercy
in
such
cases
in
these
three
cases
of
all
of
which
i
had
personal
cognizance
i
disagreed
radically
with
the
views
my
successors
took
and
with
the
views
which
many
respectable
men
took
who
in
these
and
similar
cases
both
while
i
was
in
office
and
afterward
urged
me
to
show
or
to
ask
others
to
show
clemency
it
then
seemed
to
me
and
it
now
seems
to
me
that
such
clemency
is
from
the
larger
standpoint
a
gross
wrong
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
country
one
of
the
former
special
assistants
of
the
cleveland
runyon
in
commenting
bitterly
on
the
release
of
heike
and
morse
on
account
of
their
health
pointed
out
that
their
health
apparently
became
good
when
once
they
themselves
became
free
men
and
added
the
commutation
of
these
sentences
amounts
to
a
direct
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
courts
heike
got
a
salary
and
has
escaped
his
imprisonment
but
what
about
the
six
a
week
checkers
who
were
sent
to
jail
one
of
them
a
man
of
more
than
sixty
it
is
cases
like
this
that
create
discontent
and
anarchy
they
make
it
seem
plain
that
there
is
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
man
and
i
for
one
will
protest
in
dealing
with
heike
the
individual
or
morse
or
any
other
individual
it
is
necessary
to
emphasize
the
social
aspects
of
his
case
the
moral
of
the
heike
case
as
has
been
well
said
is
how
easy
it
is
for
a
man
in
modern
corporate
organization
to
drift
into
wrongdoing
the
moral
restraints
are
loosened
in
the
case
of
a
man
like
heike
by
the
insulation
of
himself
from
the
sordid
details
of
crime
through
industrially
coerced
intervening
agents
professor
ross
has
made
the
penetrating
observation
that
distance
disinfects
dividends
it
also
weakens
individual
responsibility
particularly
on
the
part
of
the
very
managers
of
large
business
who
should
feel
it
most
acutely
one
of
the
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
who
conducted
the
suit
and
who
inclined
to
the
side
of
mercy
in
the
matter
nevertheless
writes
heike
is
a
beautiful
illustration
of
mental
and
moral
obscuration
in
the
business
life
of
an
otherwise
valuable
member
of
society
heike
had
an
ample
share
in
the
guidance
of
the
affairs
of
the
american
sugar
company
and
we
are
apt
to
have
a
foreshortened
picture
of
his
responsibility
because
he
operated
from
the
easy
coign
of
vantage
of
executive
remoteness
it
is
difficult
to
say
to
what
extent
he
did
directly
or
indirectly
profit
by
the
sordid
practices
of
his
company
but
the
social
damage
of
an
individual
in
his
position
may
be
just
as
deep
whether
merely
the
zest
of
the
game
or
hard
cash
be
his
dominant
motive
i
have
coupled
the
cases
of
the
big
banker
and
the
sugar
trust
official
and
the
case
of
the
man
convicted
of
a
criminal
assault
on
a
woman
all
of
the
criminals
were
released
from
penitentiary
sentences
on
grounds
of
ill
health
the
offenses
were
typical
of
the
worst
crimes
committed
at
the
two
ends
of
the
social
scale
one
offense
was
a
crime
of
brutal
violence
the
other
offenses
were
crimes
of
astute
corruption
all
of
them
were
offenses
which
in
my
judgment
were
of
such
a
character
that
clemency
towards
the
offender
worked
grave
injustice
to
the
community
as
a
whole
injustice
so
grave
that
its
effects
might
be
in
their
damage
every
time
that
rape
or
criminal
assault
on
a
woman
is
pardoned
and
anything
less
than
the
full
penalty
of
the
law
exacted
a
premium
is
put
on
the
practice
of
lynching
such
offenders
every
time
a
big
moneyed
offender
who
naturally
excites
interest
and
sympathy
and
who
has
many
friends
is
excused
from
serving
a
sentence
which
a
man
of
less
prominence
and
fewer
friends
would
have
to
serve
justice
is
discredited
in
the
eyes
of
plain
people
and
to
undermine
faith
in
justice
is
to
strike
at
the
foundation
of
the
republic
as
for
ill
health
it
must
be
remembered
that
few
people
are
as
healthy
in
prison
as
they
would
be
outside
and
there
should
be
no
discrimination
among
criminals
on
this
score
either
all
criminals
who
grow
unhealthy
should
be
let
out
or
none
pardons
must
sometimes
be
given
in
order
that
the
cause
of
justice
may
be
served
but
in
cases
such
as
these
i
am
considering
while
i
know
that
many
amiable
people
differ
from
me
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
in
my
judgment
the
pardons
work
harm
to
the
cause
of
justice
among
the
big
corporations
themselves
even
where
they
did
wrong
there
was
a
wide
difference
in
the
moral
obliquity
indicated
by
the
wrongdoer
there
was
a
wide
distinction
between
the
offenses
committed
in
the
case
of
the
northern
securities
company
and
the
offenses
because
of
which
the
sugar
trust
the
tobacco
trust
and
the
standard
oil
trust
were
successfully
prosecuted
under
my
administration
it
was
vital
to
destroy
the
northern
securities
company
but
the
men
creating
it
had
done
so
in
open
and
fashion
acting
under
what
they
and
most
of
the
members
of
the
bar
thought
to
be
the
law
established
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
knight
sugar
case
but
the
supreme
court
in
its
decree
dissolving
the
standard
oil
and
tobacco
trusts
condemned
them
in
the
severest
language
for
moral
turpitude
and
an
even
severer
need
of
condemnation
should
be
visited
on
the
sugar
trust
however
all
the
trusts
and
big
corporations
against
which
we
proceeded
which
included
in
their
directorates
practically
all
the
biggest
financiers
in
the
country
joined
in
making
the
bitterest
assaults
on
me
and
on
my
administration
of
their
actions
i
wrote
as
follows
to
bonaparte
who
had
been
a
peculiarly
close
friend
and
adviser
through
the
period
covered
by
my
public
life
in
high
office
and
who
together
with
moody
possessed
the
same
understanding
sympathy
with
my
social
and
industrial
program
that
was
possessed
by
such
officials
as
straus
garfield
smith
and
pinchot
the
letter
runs
january
my
dear
bonaparte
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
admirable
speech
at
chicago
you
said
the
very
things
it
was
good
to
say
at
this
time
what
you
said
bore
especial
weight
because
it
represented
what
you
had
done
you
have
shown
by
what
you
have
actually
accomplished
that
the
law
is
enforced
against
the
wealthiest
corporation
and
the
richest
and
most
powerful
manager
or
manipulator
of
that
corporation
just
as
resolutely
and
fearlessly
as
against
the
humblest
citizen
the
department
of
justice
is
now
in
very
fact
the
department
of
justice
and
justice
is
meted
out
with
an
even
hand
to
great
and
small
rich
and
poor
weak
and
strong
those
who
have
denounced
you
and
the
action
of
the
department
of
justice
are
either
misled
or
else
are
the
very
wrongdoers
and
the
agents
of
the
very
wrongdoers
who
have
for
so
many
years
gone
and
flouted
the
laws
with
impunity
above
all
you
are
to
be
congratulated
upon
the
bitterness
felt
and
expressed
towards
you
by
the
representatives
and
agents
of
the
great
corporations
of
immense
wealth
who
until
within
the
last
years
have
treated
themselves
and
have
expected
others
to
treat
them
as
being
beyond
and
above
all
possible
check
from
law
it
was
time
to
say
something
for
the
representatives
of
predatory
wealth
of
wealth
accumulated
on
a
giant
scale
by
iniquity
by
wrongdoing
in
many
forms
by
plain
swindling
by
oppressing
by
manipulating
securities
by
unfair
and
unwholesome
competition
and
by
in
short
by
conduct
abhorrent
to
every
man
of
ordinarily
decent
conscience
have
during
the
last
few
months
made
it
evident
that
they
are
banded
together
to
work
for
a
reaction
to
endeavor
to
overthrow
and
discredit
all
who
honestly
administer
the
law
and
to
secure
a
return
to
the
days
when
every
unscrupulous
wrongdoer
could
do
what
he
wished
unchecked
provided
he
had
enough
money
they
attack
you
because
they
know
your
honesty
and
fearlessness
and
dread
them
the
enormous
sums
of
money
these
men
have
at
their
control
enable
them
to
carry
on
an
effective
campaign
they
find
their
tools
in
a
portion
of
the
public
press
including
especially
certain
of
the
great
new
york
newspapers
they
find
their
agents
in
some
men
in
public
life
now
and
then
occupying
or
having
occupied
positions
as
high
as
senator
or
governor
in
some
men
in
the
pulpit
and
most
melancholy
of
all
in
a
few
men
on
the
bench
by
gifts
to
colleges
and
universities
they
are
occasionally
able
to
subsidize
in
their
own
interest
some
head
of
an
educational
body
who
save
only
a
judge
should
of
all
men
be
most
careful
to
keep
his
skirts
clear
from
the
taint
of
such
corruption
there
are
ample
material
rewards
for
those
who
serve
with
fidelity
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
but
they
are
dearly
paid
for
by
that
institution
of
learning
whose
head
by
example
and
precept
teaches
the
scholars
who
sit
under
him
that
there
is
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
the
amount
of
money
the
representatives
of
the
great
moneyed
interests
are
willing
to
spend
can
be
gauged
by
their
recent
publication
broadcast
throughout
the
papers
of
this
country
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
of
huge
advertisements
attacking
with
envenomed
bitterness
the
administration
policy
of
warring
against
successful
dishonesty
advertisements
that
must
have
cost
enormous
sums
of
money
this
advertisement
as
also
a
pamphlet
called
the
roosevelt
panic
and
one
or
two
similar
books
and
pamphlets
are
written
especially
in
the
interest
of
the
standard
oil
and
harriman
combinations
but
also
defend
all
the
individuals
and
corporations
of
great
wealth
that
have
been
guilty
of
wrongdoing
from
the
railroad
rate
law
to
the
pure
food
law
every
measure
for
honesty
in
business
that
has
been
pressed
during
the
last
six
years
has
been
opposed
by
these
men
on
its
passage
and
in
its
administration
with
every
resource
that
bitter
and
unscrupulous
craft
could
suggest
and
the
command
of
almost
unlimited
money
secure
these
men
do
not
themselves
speak
or
write
they
hire
others
to
do
their
bidding
their
spirit
and
purpose
are
made
clear
alike
by
the
editorials
of
the
papers
owned
in
or
whose
policy
is
dictated
by
wall
street
and
by
the
speeches
of
public
men
who
as
senators
governors
or
mayors
have
served
these
their
masters
to
the
cost
of
the
plain
people
at
one
time
one
of
their
writers
or
speakers
attacks
the
rate
law
as
the
cause
of
the
panic
he
is
whether
in
public
life
or
not
usually
a
clever
corporation
lawyer
and
he
is
not
so
foolish
a
being
as
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
what
he
says
he
has
too
closely
represented
the
railroads
not
to
know
well
that
the
hepburn
rate
bill
has
helped
every
honest
railroad
and
has
hurt
only
the
railroads
that
regarded
themselves
as
above
the
law
at
another
time
one
of
them
assails
the
administration
for
not
imprisoning
people
under
the
sherman
law
for
declining
to
make
what
he
well
knows
in
view
of
the
actual
attitude
of
juries
as
shown
in
the
tobacco
trust
cases
and
in
san
francisco
in
one
or
two
of
the
cases
brought
against
corrupt
business
men
would
have
been
the
futile
endeavor
to
imprison
defendants
whom
we
are
actually
able
to
fine
he
raises
the
usual
clamor
raised
by
all
who
object
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
that
we
are
fining
corporations
instead
of
putting
the
heads
of
the
corporations
in
jail
and
he
states
that
this
does
not
really
harm
the
chief
offenders
were
this
statement
true
he
himself
would
not
be
found
attacking
us
the
extraordinary
violence
of
the
assault
upon
our
policy
contained
in
speeches
like
these
in
the
articles
in
the
subsidized
press
in
such
huge
advertisements
and
pamphlets
as
those
above
referred
to
and
the
enormous
sums
of
money
spent
in
these
various
ways
give
a
fairly
accurate
measure
of
the
anger
and
terror
which
our
actions
have
caused
the
corrupt
men
of
vast
wealth
to
feel
in
the
very
marrow
of
their
being
the
man
thus
attacking
us
is
usually
like
so
many
of
his
fellows
either
a
great
lawyer
or
a
paid
editor
who
takes
his
commands
from
the
financiers
and
his
arguments
from
their
attorneys
if
the
former
he
has
defended
many
malefactors
and
he
knows
well
that
thanks
to
the
advice
of
lawyers
like
himself
a
certain
kind
of
modern
corporation
has
been
turned
into
an
admirable
instrument
by
which
to
render
it
well
nigh
impossible
to
get
at
the
really
guilty
man
so
that
in
most
cases
the
only
way
of
punishing
the
wrong
is
by
fining
the
corporation
or
by
proceeding
personally
against
some
of
the
minor
agents
these
lawyers
and
their
employers
are
the
men
mainly
responsible
for
this
state
of
things
and
their
responsibility
is
shared
with
the
legislators
who
ingeniously
oppose
the
passing
of
just
and
effective
laws
and
with
those
judges
whose
one
aim
seems
to
be
to
construe
such
laws
so
that
they
can
not
be
executed
nothing
is
sillier
than
this
outcry
on
behalf
of
the
innocent
stockholders
in
the
corporations
we
are
besought
to
pity
the
standard
oil
company
for
a
fine
relatively
far
less
great
than
the
fines
every
day
inflicted
in
the
police
courts
upon
multitudes
of
push
cart
peddlers
and
other
petty
offenders
whose
woes
never
extort
one
word
from
the
men
whose
withers
are
wrung
by
the
woes
of
the
mighty
the
stockholders
have
the
control
of
the
corporation
in
their
own
hands
the
corporation
officials
are
elected
by
those
holding
the
majority
of
the
stock
and
can
keep
office
only
by
having
behind
them
the
of
these
majority
stockholders
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
slightest
pity
if
they
deliberately
choose
to
resign
into
the
hands
of
great
wrongdoers
the
control
of
the
corporations
in
which
they
own
the
stock
of
course
innocent
people
have
become
involved
in
these
big
corporations
and
suffer
because
of
the
misdeeds
of
their
criminal
associates
let
these
innocent
people
be
careful
not
to
invest
in
corporations
where
those
in
control
are
not
men
of
probity
men
who
respect
the
laws
above
all
let
them
avoid
the
men
who
make
it
their
one
effort
to
evade
or
defy
the
laws
but
if
these
honest
innocent
people
are
in
the
majority
in
any
corporation
they
can
immediately
resume
control
and
throw
out
of
the
directory
the
men
who
misrepresent
them
does
any
man
for
a
moment
suppose
that
the
majority
stockholders
of
the
standard
oil
are
others
than
rockefeller
and
his
associates
themselves
and
the
beneficiaries
of
their
wrongdoing
when
the
stock
is
watered
so
that
the
innocent
investors
suffer
a
grave
wrong
is
indeed
done
to
these
innocent
investors
as
well
as
to
the
public
but
the
public
men
lawyers
and
editors
to
whom
i
refer
do
not
under
these
circumstances
express
sympathy
for
the
innocent
on
the
contrary
they
are
the
first
to
protest
with
frantic
vehemence
against
our
efforts
by
law
to
put
a
stop
to
and
the
apologists
of
successful
dishonesty
always
declaim
against
any
effort
to
punish
or
prevent
it
on
the
ground
that
such
effort
will
unsettle
business
it
is
they
who
by
their
acts
have
unsettled
business
and
the
very
men
raising
this
cry
spend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
securing
by
speech
editorial
book
or
pamphlet
the
defense
by
misstatement
of
what
they
have
done
and
yet
when
we
correct
their
misstatements
by
telling
the
truth
they
declaim
against
us
for
breaking
silence
lest
values
be
unsettled
they
have
hurt
honest
business
men
honest
working
men
honest
farmers
and
now
they
clamor
against
the
truth
being
told
the
keynote
of
all
these
attacks
upon
the
effort
to
secure
honesty
in
business
and
in
politics
is
expressed
in
a
recent
speech
in
which
the
speaker
stated
that
prosperity
had
been
checked
by
the
effort
for
the
moral
regeneration
of
the
business
world
an
effort
which
he
denounced
as
unnatural
unwarranted
and
injurious
and
for
which
he
stated
the
panic
was
the
penalty
the
morality
of
such
a
plea
is
precisely
as
great
as
if
made
on
behalf
of
the
men
caught
in
a
gambling
establishment
when
that
gambling
establishment
is
raided
by
the
police
if
such
words
mean
anything
they
mean
that
those
whose
sentiments
they
represent
stand
against
the
effort
to
bring
about
a
moral
regeneration
of
business
which
will
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
insurance
banking
and
street
railroad
scandals
in
new
york
a
repetition
of
the
chicago
and
alton
deal
a
repetition
of
the
combination
between
certain
professional
politicians
certain
professional
labor
leaders
and
certain
big
financiers
from
the
disgrace
of
which
san
francisco
has
just
been
rescued
a
repetition
of
the
successful
efforts
by
the
standard
oil
people
to
crush
out
every
competitor
to
overawe
the
common
carriers
and
to
establish
a
monopoly
which
treats
the
public
with
the
contempt
which
the
public
deserves
so
long
as
it
permits
men
like
the
public
men
of
whom
i
speak
to
represent
it
in
politics
men
like
the
heads
of
colleges
to
whom
i
refer
to
educate
its
youth
the
outcry
against
stopping
dishonest
practices
among
the
very
wealthy
is
precisely
similar
to
the
outcry
raised
against
every
effort
for
cleanliness
and
decency
in
city
government
because
forsooth
it
will
hurt
business
the
same
outcry
is
made
against
the
department
of
justice
for
prosecuting
the
heads
of
colossal
corporations
that
is
made
against
the
men
who
in
san
francisco
are
prosecuting
with
impartial
severity
the
wrongdoers
among
business
men
public
officials
and
labor
leaders
alike
the
principle
is
the
same
in
the
two
cases
just
as
the
blackmailer
and
the
bribe
giver
stand
on
the
same
evil
eminence
of
infamy
so
the
man
who
makes
an
enormous
fortune
by
corrupting
legislatures
and
municipalities
and
fleecing
his
stockholders
and
the
public
stands
on
a
level
with
the
creature
who
fattens
on
the
blood
money
of
the
gambling
house
the
saloon
and
the
brothel
moreover
both
kinds
of
corruption
in
the
last
analysis
are
far
more
intimately
connected
than
would
at
first
sight
appear
the
is
at
bottom
the
same
corrupt
business
and
corrupt
politics
act
and
react
with
ever
increasing
debasement
one
on
the
other
the
the
the
manipulator
of
securities
the
purveyor
and
protector
of
vice
the
ward
boss
the
ballot
box
stuffer
the
demagogue
the
mob
leader
the
hired
bully
and
mankiller
all
alike
work
at
the
same
web
of
corruption
and
all
alike
should
be
abhorred
by
honest
men
the
business
which
is
hurt
by
the
movement
for
honesty
is
the
kind
of
business
which
in
the
long
run
it
pays
the
country
to
have
hurt
it
is
the
kind
of
business
which
has
tended
to
make
the
very
name
high
finance
a
term
of
scandal
to
which
all
honest
american
men
of
business
should
join
in
putting
an
end
one
of
the
special
pleaders
for
business
dishonesty
in
a
recent
speech
in
denouncing
the
administration
for
enforcing
the
law
against
the
huge
and
corrupt
corporations
which
have
defied
the
law
also
denounced
it
for
endeavoring
to
secure
a
law
making
employers
liable
for
injuries
to
their
employees
it
is
meet
and
fit
that
the
apologists
for
corrupt
wealth
should
oppose
every
effort
to
relieve
weak
and
helpless
people
from
crushing
misfortune
brought
upon
them
by
injury
in
the
business
from
which
they
gain
a
bare
livelihood
and
their
employers
fortunes
it
is
hypocritical
baseness
to
speak
of
a
girl
who
works
in
a
factory
where
the
dangerous
machinery
is
unprotected
as
having
the
right
freely
to
contract
to
expose
herself
to
dangers
to
life
and
limb
she
has
no
alternative
but
to
suffer
want
or
else
to
expose
herself
to
such
dangers
and
when
she
loses
a
hand
or
is
otherwise
maimed
or
disfigured
for
life
it
is
a
moral
wrong
that
the
burden
of
the
risk
necessarily
incidental
to
the
business
should
be
placed
with
crushing
weight
upon
her
weak
shoulders
and
the
man
who
has
profited
by
her
work
escape
this
is
what
our
opponents
advocate
and
it
is
proper
that
they
should
advocate
it
for
it
rounds
out
their
advocacy
of
those
most
dangerous
members
of
the
criminal
class
the
criminals
of
vast
wealth
the
men
who
can
afford
best
to
pay
for
such
championship
in
the
press
and
on
the
stump
it
is
difficult
to
speak
about
the
judges
for
it
behooves
us
all
to
treat
with
the
utmost
respect
the
high
office
of
judge
and
our
judges
as
a
whole
are
brave
and
upright
men
but
there
is
need
that
those
who
go
wrong
should
not
be
allowed
to
feel
that
there
is
no
condemnation
of
their
wrongdoing
a
judge
who
on
the
bench
either
truckles
to
the
mob
or
bows
down
before
a
corporation
or
who
having
left
the
bench
to
become
a
corporation
lawyer
seeks
to
aid
his
clients
by
denouncing
as
enemies
of
property
all
those
who
seek
to
stop
the
abuses
of
the
criminal
rich
such
a
man
performs
an
even
worse
service
to
the
body
politic
than
the
legislator
or
executive
who
goes
wrong
in
no
way
can
respect
for
the
courts
be
so
quickly
undermined
as
by
teaching
the
public
through
the
action
of
a
judge
himself
that
there
is
reason
for
the
loss
of
such
respect
the
judge
who
by
word
or
deed
makes
it
plain
that
the
corrupt
corporation
the
corporation
the
rich
man
has
in
him
a
sure
and
trustworthy
ally
the
judge
who
by
misuse
of
the
process
of
injunction
makes
it
plain
that
in
him
the
has
a
determined
and
unscrupulous
enemy
the
judge
who
when
he
decides
in
an
employers
liability
or
a
tenement
house
factory
case
shows
that
he
has
neither
sympathy
for
nor
understanding
of
those
of
his
who
most
need
his
sympathy
and
understanding
these
judges
work
as
much
evil
as
if
they
pandered
to
the
mob
as
if
they
shrank
from
sternly
repressing
violence
and
disorder
the
judge
who
does
his
full
duty
well
stands
higher
and
renders
a
better
service
to
the
people
than
any
other
public
servant
he
is
entitled
to
greater
respect
and
if
he
is
a
true
servant
of
the
people
if
he
is
upright
wise
and
fearless
he
will
unhesitatingly
disregard
even
the
wishes
of
the
people
if
they
conflict
with
the
eternal
principles
of
right
as
against
wrong
he
must
serve
the
people
but
he
must
serve
his
conscience
first
all
honor
to
such
a
judge
and
all
honor
can
not
be
rendered
him
if
it
is
rendered
equally
to
his
brethren
who
fall
immeasurably
below
the
high
ideals
for
which
he
stands
there
should
be
a
sharp
discrimination
against
such
judges
they
claim
immunity
from
criticism
and
the
claim
is
heatedly
advanced
by
men
and
newspapers
like
those
of
whom
i
speak
most
certainly
they
can
claim
immunity
from
untruthful
criticism
and
their
champions
the
newspapers
and
the
public
men
i
have
mentioned
exquisitely
illustrate
by
their
own
actions
mendacious
criticism
in
its
most
flagrant
and
iniquitous
form
but
no
servant
of
the
people
has
a
right
to
expect
to
be
free
from
just
and
honest
criticism
it
is
the
newspapers
and
the
public
men
whose
thoughts
and
deeds
show
them
to
be
most
alien
to
honesty
and
truth
who
themselves
loudly
object
to
truthful
and
honest
criticism
of
their
of
the
great
moneyed
interests
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
individuals
whether
public
men
lawyers
or
editors
to
whom
i
refer
these
men
derive
their
sole
power
from
the
great
sinister
offenders
who
stand
behind
them
they
are
but
puppets
who
move
as
the
strings
are
pulled
by
those
who
control
the
enormous
masses
of
corporate
wealth
which
if
itself
left
uncontrolled
threatens
dire
evil
to
the
republic
it
is
not
the
puppets
but
the
strong
cunning
men
and
the
mighty
forces
working
for
evil
behind
and
to
a
certain
extent
through
the
puppets
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
we
seek
to
control
wealth
in
the
first
place
to
prevent
its
doing
evil
and
in
the
next
place
to
avoid
the
vindictive
and
dreadful
radicalism
which
if
left
uncontrolled
it
is
certain
in
the
end
to
arouse
sweeping
attacks
upon
all
property
upon
all
men
of
means
without
regard
to
whether
they
do
well
or
ill
would
sound
the
death
knell
of
the
republic
and
such
attacks
become
inevitable
if
decent
citizens
permit
rich
men
whose
lives
are
corrupt
and
evil
to
domineer
in
swollen
pride
unchecked
and
unhindered
over
the
destinies
of
this
country
we
act
in
no
vindictive
spirit
and
we
are
no
respecters
of
persons
if
a
labor
union
does
what
is
wrong
we
oppose
it
as
fearlessly
as
we
oppose
a
corporation
that
does
wrong
and
we
stand
with
equal
stoutness
for
the
rights
of
the
man
of
wealth
and
for
the
rights
of
the
just
as
much
so
for
one
as
for
the
other
we
seek
to
stop
wrongdoing
and
we
desire
to
punish
the
wrongdoer
only
so
far
as
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
this
end
we
are
the
stanch
upholders
of
every
honest
man
whether
business
man
or
i
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
our
actions
have
brought
on
business
distress
so
far
as
this
is
due
to
local
and
not
causes
and
to
the
actions
of
any
particular
individuals
it
is
due
to
the
speculative
folly
and
flagrant
dishonesty
of
a
few
men
of
great
wealth
who
now
seek
to
shield
themselves
from
the
effects
of
their
own
wrongdoings
by
ascribing
its
results
to
the
actions
of
those
who
have
sought
to
put
a
stop
to
the
wrongdoing
but
if
it
were
true
that
to
cut
out
rottenness
from
the
body
politic
meant
a
momentary
check
to
an
unhealthy
seeming
prosperity
i
should
not
for
one
moment
hesitate
to
put
the
knife
to
the
cancer
on
behalf
of
all
our
people
on
behalf
no
less
of
the
honest
man
of
means
than
of
the
honest
man
who
earns
each
day
livelihood
by
that
day
sweat
of
his
brow
it
is
necessary
to
insist
upon
honesty
in
business
and
politics
alike
in
all
walks
of
life
in
big
things
and
in
little
things
upon
just
and
fair

as
between

we

social
and
industrial
justice
by
the
time
i
became
president
i
had
grown
to
feel
with
deep
intensity
of
conviction
that
governmental
agencies
must
find
their
justification
largely
in
the
way
in
which
they
are
used
for
the
practical
betterment
of
living
and
working
conditions
among
the
mass
of
the
people
i
felt
that
the
fight
was
really
for
the
abolition
of
privilege
and
one
of
the
first
stages
in
the
battle
was
necessarily
to
fight
for
the
rights
of
the
workingman
for
this
reason
i
felt
most
strongly
that
all
that
the
government
could
do
in
the
interest
of
labor
should
be
done
the
federal
government
can
rarely
act
with
the
directness
that
the
state
governments
act
it
can
however
do
a
good
deal
my
purpose
was
to
make
the
national
government
itself
a
model
employer
of
labor
the
effort
being
to
make
the
per
diem
employee
just
as
much
as
the
cabinet
officer
regard
himself
as
one
of
the
partners
employed
in
the
service
of
the
public
proud
of
his
work
eager
to
do
it
in
the
best
possible
manner
and
confident
of
just
treatment
our
aim
was
also
to
secure
good
laws
wherever
the
national
government
had
power
notably
in
the
territories
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
connection
with
commerce
i
found
the
law
a
mere
farce
the
departments
rarely
enforcing
it
with
any
degree
of
efficiency
this
i
remedied
by
executive
action
unfortunately
thoroughly
efficient
government
servants
often
proved
to
be
the
prime
offenders
so
far
as
the
enforcement
of
the
law
was
concerned
because
in
their
zeal
to
get
good
work
done
for
the
government
they
became
harsh
taskmasters
and
declined
to
consider
the
needs
of
their
who
served
under
them
the
more
i
had
studied
the
subject
the
more
strongly
i
had
become
convinced
that
an
day
under
the
conditions
of
labor
in
the
united
states
was
all
that
could
with
wisdom
and
propriety
be
required
either
by
the
government
or
by
private
employers
that
more
than
this
meant
on
the
average
a
decrease
in
the
qualities
that
tell
for
good
citizenship
i
finally
solved
the
problem
as
far
as
government
employees
were
concerned
by
calling
in
charles
neill
the
head
of
the
labor
bureau
and
acting
on
his
advice
i
speedily
made
the
law
really
effective
any
man
who
shirked
his
work
who
dawdled
and
idled
received
no
mercy
slackness
is
even
worse
than
harshness
for
exactly
as
in
battle
mercy
to
the
coward
is
cruelty
to
the
brave
man
so
in
civil
life
slackness
towards
the
vicious
and
idle
is
harshness
towards
the
honest
and
hardworking
we
passed
a
good
law
protecting
the
lives
and
health
of
miners
in
the
territories
and
other
laws
providing
for
the
supervision
of
employment
agencies
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
protecting
the
health
of
motormen
and
conductors
on
street
railways
in
the
district
we
practically
started
the
bureau
of
mines
we
provided
for
safeguarding
factory
employees
in
the
district
against
accidents
and
for
the
restriction
of
child
labor
therein
we
passed
a
workmen
compensation
law
for
the
protection
of
government
employees
a
law
which
did
not
go
as
far
as
i
wished
but
which
was
the
best
i
could
get
and
which
committed
the
government
to
the
right
policy
we
provided
for
an
investigation
of
woman
and
child
labor
in
the
united
states
we
incorporated
the
national
child
labor
committee
where
we
had
most
difficulty
was
with
the
railway
companies
engaged
in
business
we
passed
an
act
improving
safety
appliances
on
railway
trains
without
much
opposition
but
we
had
more
trouble
with
acts
regulating
the
hours
of
labor
of
railway
employees
and
making
those
railways
which
were
engaged
in
commerce
liable
for
injuries
to
or
the
death
of
their
employees
while
on
duty
one
important
step
in
connection
with
these
latter
laws
was
taken
by
moody
when
on
behalf
of
the
government
he
intervened
in
the
case
of
a
wronged
employee
it
is
unjust
that
a
law
which
has
been
declared
public
policy
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
should
be
submitted
to
the
possibility
of
nullification
because
the
government
leaves
the
enforcement
of
it
to
the
private
initiative
of
poor
people
who
have
just
suffered
some
crushing
accident
it
should
be
the
business
of
the
government
to
enforce
laws
of
this
kind
and
to
appear
in
court
to
argue
for
their
constitutionality
and
proper
enforcement
thanks
to
moody
the
government
assumed
this
position
the
first
employers
liability
law
affecting
railroads
was
declared
unconstitutional
we
got
through
another
which
stood
the
test
of
the
courts
the
principle
to
which
we
especially
strove
to
give
expression
through
these
laws
and
through
executive
action
was
that
a
right
is
valueless
unless
reduced
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
this
sounds
like
a
truism
so
far
from
being
such
the
effort
practically
to
apply
it
was
almost
revolutionary
and
gave
rise
to
the
bitterest
denunciation
of
us
by
all
the
big
lawyers
and
all
the
big
newspaper
editors
who
whether
sincerely
or
for
hire
gave
expression
to
the
views
of
the
privileged
classes
ever
since
the
civil
war
very
many
of
the
decisions
of
the
courts
not
as
regards
ordinary
actions
between
man
and
man
but
as
regards
the
application
of
great
governmental
policies
for
social
and
industrial
justice
had
been
in
reality
nothing
but
ingenious
justification
of
the
theory
that
these
policies
were
mere
abstractions
and
were
not
to
be
given
practical
effect
the
tendency
of
the
courts
had
been
in
the
majority
of
cases
jealously
to
exert
their
great
power
in
protecting
those
who
least
needed
protection
and
hardly
to
use
their
power
at
all
in
the
interest
of
those
who
most
needed
protection
our
desire
was
to
make
the
federal
government
efficient
as
an
instrument
for
protecting
the
rights
of
labor
within
its
province
and
therefore
to
secure
and
enforce
judicial
decisions
which
would
permit
us
to
make
this
desire
effective
not
only
some
of
the
federal
judges
but
some
of
the
state
courts
invoked
the
constitution
in
a
spirit
of
the
narrowest
legalistic
obstruction
to
prevent
the
government
from
acting
in
defense
of
labor
on
railways
in
effect
these
judges
took
the
view
that
while
congress
had
complete
power
as
regards
the
goods
transported
by
the
railways
and
could
protect
wealthy
or
owners
of
these
goods
yet
that
it
had
no
power
to
protect
the
lives
of
the
men
engaged
in
transporting
the
goods
such
judges
freely
issued
injunctions
to
prevent
the
obstruction
of
traffic
in
the
interest
of
the
property
owners
but
declared
unconstitutional
the
action
of
the
government
in
seeking
to
safeguard
the
men
and
the
families
of
the
men
without
whose
labor
the
traffic
could
not
take
place
it
was
an
instance
of
the
largely
unconscious
way
in
which
the
courts
had
been
twisted
into
the
exaltation
of
property
rights
over
human
rights
and
the
subordination
of
the
welfare
of
the
laborer
when
compared
with
the
profit
of
the
man
for
whom
he
labored
by
what
i
fear
my
conservative
friends
regarded
as
frightfully
aggressive
missionary
work
which
included
some
uncommonly
plain
speaking
as
to
certain
unjust
and
judicial
decisions
we
succeeded
in
largely
but
by
no
means
altogether
correcting
this
view
at
least
so
far
as
the
best
and
most
enlightened
judges
were
concerned
very
much
the
most
important
action
i
took
as
regards
labor
had
nothing
to
do
with
legislation
and
represented
executive
action
which
was
not
required
by
the
constitution
it
illustrated
as
well
as
anything
that
i
did
the
theory
which
i
have
called
the
theory
of
the
presidency
that
is
that
occasionally
great
national
crises
arise
which
call
for
immediate
and
vigorous
executive
action
and
that
in
such
cases
it
is
the
duty
of
the
president
to
act
upon
the
theory
that
he
is
the
steward
of
the
people
and
that
the
proper
attitude
for
him
to
take
is
that
he
is
bound
to
assume
that
he
has
the
legal
right
to
do
whatever
the
needs
of
the
people
demand
unless
the
constitution
or
the
laws
explicitly
forbid
him
to
do
it
early
in
the
spring
of
a
universal
strike
began
in
the
anthracite
regions
the
miners
and
the
operators
became
deeply
embittered
and
the
strike
went
on
throughout
the
summer
and
the
early
fall
without
any
sign
of
reaching
an
end
and
with
almost
complete
stoppage
of
mining
in
many
cities
especially
in
the
east
the
heating
apparatus
is
designed
for
anthracite
so
that
the
bituminous
coal
is
only
a
very
partial
substitute
moreover
in
many
regions
even
in
farmhouses
many
of
the
provisions
are
for
burning
coal
and
not
wood
in
consequence
the
coal
famine
became
a
national
menace
as
the
winter
approached
in
most
big
cities
and
many
farming
districts
east
of
the
mississippi
the
shortage
of
anthracite
threatened
calamity
in
the
populous
industrial
states
from
ohio
eastward
it
was
not
merely
calamity
but
the
direct
disaster
that
was
threatened
ordinarily
conservative
men
men
very
sensitive
as
to
the
rights
of
property
under
normal
conditions
when
faced
by
this
crisis
felt
quite
rightly
that
there
must
be
some
radical
action
the
governor
of
massachusetts
and
the
mayor
of
new
york
both
notified
me
as
the
cold
weather
came
on
that
if
the
coal
famine
continued
the
misery
throughout
the
northeast
and
especially
in
the
great
cities
would
become
appalling
and
the
consequent
public
disorder
so
great
that
frightful
consequences
might
follow
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
situation
which
confronted
pennsylvania
new
york
and
new
england
and
to
a
less
degree
the
states
of
the
middle
west
in
october
was
quite
as
serious
as
if
they
had
been
threatened
by
the
invasion
of
a
hostile
army
of
overwhelming
force
the
big
coal
operators
had
banded
together
and
positively
refused
to
take
any
steps
looking
toward
an
accommodation
they
knew
that
the
suffering
among
the
miners
was
great
they
were
confident
that
if
order
were
kept
and
nothing
further
done
by
the
government
they
would
win
and
they
refused
to
consider
that
the
public
had
any
rights
in
the
matter
they
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
unquestionably
good
private
life
and
they
were
merely
taking
the
extreme
individualistic
view
of
the
rights
of
property
and
the
freedom
of
individual
action
upheld
in
the
political
economics
the
mines
were
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
there
was
no
duty
whatever
laid
upon
me
by
the
constitution
in
the
matter
and
i
had
in
theory
the
power
to
act
directly
unless
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
or
the
legislature
if
it
were
in
session
should
notify
me
that
pennsylvania
could
not
keep
order
and
request
me
as
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
to
intervene
and
keep
order
as
long
as
i
could
avoid
interfering
i
did
so
but
i
directed
the
head
of
the
labor
bureau
carroll
wright
to
make
a
thorough
investigation
and
lay
the
facts
fully
before
me
as
september
passed
without
any
sign
of
weakening
either
among
the
employers
or
the
striking
workmen
the
situation
became
so
grave
that
i
felt
i
would
have
to
try
to
do
something
the
thing
most
feasible
was
to
get
both
sides
to
agree
to
a
commission
of
arbitration
with
a
promise
to
accept
its
findings
the
miners
to
go
to
work
as
soon
as
the
commission
was
appointed
at
the
old
rate
of
wages
to
this
proposition
the
miners
headed
by
john
mitchell
agreed
stipulating
only
that
i
should
have
the
power
to
name
the
commission
the
operators
however
positively
refused
they
insisted
that
all
that
was
necessary
to
do
was
for
the
state
to
keep
order
using
the
militia
as
a
police
force
although
both
they
and
the
miners
asked
me
to
intervene
under
the
commerce
law
each
side
requesting
that
i
proceed
against
the
other
and
both
requests
being
impossible
finally
on
october
the
representatives
of
both
the
operators
and
the
miners
met
before
me
in
pursuance
of
my
request
the
representatives
of
the
miners
included
as
their
head
and
spokesman
john
mitchell
who
kept
his
temper
admirably
and
showed
to
much
advantage
the
representatives
of
the
operators
on
the
contrary
came
down
in
a
most
insolent
frame
of
mind
refused
to
talk
of
arbitration
or
other
accommodation
of
any
kind
and
used
language
that
was
insulting
to
the
miners
and
offensive
to
me
they
were
curiously
ignorant
of
the
popular
temper
and
when
they
went
away
from
the
interview
they
with
much
pride
gave
their
own
account
of
it
to
the
papers
exulting
in
the
fact
that
they
had
turned
down
both
the
miners
and
the
president
i
refused
to
accept
the
rebuff
however
and
continued
the
effort
to
get
an
agreement
between
the
operators
and
the
miners
i
was
anxious
to
get
this
agreement
because
it
would
prevent
the
necessity
of
taking
the
extremely
drastic
action
i
meditated
and
which
is
hereinafter
described
fortunately
this
time
we
were
successful
yet
we
were
on
the
verge
of
failure
because
of
obstinacy
on
the
part
of
the
operators
this
obstinacy
was
utterly
silly
from
their
own
standpoint
and
criminal
from
the
standpoint
of
the
people
at
large
the
miners
proposed
that
i
should
name
the
commission
and
that
if
i
put
on
a
representative
of
the
employing
class
i
should
also
put
on
a
labor
union
man
the
operators
positively
declined
to
accept
the
suggestion
they
insisted
upon
my
naming
a
commission
of
only
five
men
and
specified
the
qualifications
these
men
should
have
carefully
choosing
these
qualifications
so
as
to
exclude
those
whom
it
had
leaked
out
i
was
thinking
of
appointing
including
cleveland
they
made
the
condition
that
i
was
to
appoint
one
officer
of
the
engineer
corps
of
the
army
or
navy
one
man
with
experience
of
mining
one
man
of
prominence
eminent
as
a
sociologist
one
federal
judge
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
and
one
mining
engineer
they
positively
refused
to
have
me
appoint
any
representative
of
labor
or
to
put
on
an
extra
man
i
was
desirous
of
putting
on
the
extra
man
because
mitchell
and
the
other
leaders
of
the
miners
had
urged
me
to
appoint
some
high
catholic
ecclesiastic
most
of
the
miners
were
catholics
and
mitchell
and
the
leaders
were
very
anxious
to
secure
peaceful
acquiescence
by
the
miners
in
any
decision
rendered
and
they
felt
that
their
hands
would
be
strengthened
if
such
an
appointment
were
made
they
also
quite
properly
insisted
that
there
should
be
one
representative
of
labor
on
the
commission
as
all
of
the
others
represented
the
propertied
classes
the
operators
however
absolutely
refused
to
acquiesce
in
the
appointment
of
any
representative
of
labor
and
also
announced
that
they
would
refuse
to
accept
a
sixth
man
on
the
commission
although
they
spoke
much
less
decidedly
on
this
point
the
labor
men
left
everything
in
my
hands
the
final
conferences
with
the
representatives
of
the
operators
took
place
in
my
rooms
on
the
evening
of
october
hour
after
hour
went
by
while
i
endeavored
to
make
the
operators
through
their
representatives
see
that
the
country
would
not
tolerate
their
insisting
upon
such
conditions
but
in
vain
the
two
representatives
of
the
operators
were
robert
bacon
and
george
perkins
they
were
entirely
reasonable
but
the
operators
themselves
were
entirely
unreasonable
they
had
worked
themselves
into
a
frame
of
mind
where
they
were
prepared
to
sacrifice
everything
and
see
civil
war
in
the
country
rather
than
back
down
and
acquiesce
in
the
appointment
of
a
representative
of
labor
it
looked
as
if
a
deadlock
were
inevitable
then
suddenly
after
about
two
hours
argument
it
dawned
on
me
that
they
were
not
objecting
to
the
thing
but
to
the
name
i
found
that
they
did
not
mind
my
appointing
any
man
whether
he
was
a
labor
man
or
not
so
long
as
he
was
not
appointed
a
labor
man
or
a
representative
of
labor
they
did
not
object
to
my
exercising
any
latitude
i
chose
in
the
appointments
so
long
as
they
were
made
under
the
headings
they
had
given
i
shall
never
forget
the
mixture
of
relief
and
amusement
i
felt
when
i
thoroughly
grasped
the
fact
that
while
they
would
heroically
submit
to
anarchy
rather
than
have
tweedledum
yet
if
i
would
call
it
tweedledee
they
would
accept
it
with
rapture
it
gave
me
an
illuminating
glimpse
into
one
corner
of
the
mighty
brains
of
these
captains
of
industry
in
order
to
carry
the
great
and
vital
point
and
secure
agreement
by
both
parties
all
that
was
necessary
for
me
to
do
was
to
commit
a
technical
and
nominal
absurdity
with
a
solemn
face
this
i
gladly
did
i
announced
at
once
that
i
accepted
the
terms
laid
down
with
this
understanding
i
appointed
the
labor
man
i
had
all
along
had
in
view
clark
the
head
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
conductors
calling
him
an
eminent
sociologist
a
term
which
i
doubt
whether
he
had
ever
previously
heard
he
was
a
man
whom
i
afterward
put
on
the
commerce
commission
i
added
to
the
arbitration
commission
on
my
own
authority
a
sixth
member
in
the
person
of
bishop
spalding
a
catholic
bishop
of
peoria
one
of
the
very
best
men
to
be
found
in
the
entire
country
the
man
whom
the
operators
had
expected
me
to
appoint
as
the
sociologist
was
carroll
wright
who
really
was
an
eminent
sociologist
i
put
him
on
as
recorder
of
the
commission
and
added
him
as
a
seventh
member
as
soon
as
the
commission
got
fairly
started
in
publishing
the
list
of
the
commissioners
when
i
came
to
clark
appointment
i
added
as
a
sociologist
the
president
assuming
that
for
the
purposes
of
such
a
commission
the
term
sociologist
means
a
man
who
has
thought
and
studied
deeply
on
social
questions
and
has
practically
applied
his
knowledge
the
relief
of
the
whole
country
was
so
great
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
head
of
the
brotherhood
of
railway
conductors
as
an
eminent
sociologist
merely
furnished
material
for
puzzled
comment
on
the
part
of
the
press
it
was
a
most
admirable
commission
it
did
a
noteworthy
work
and
its
report
is
a
monument
in
the
history
of
the
relations
of
labor
and
capital
in
this
country
the
strike
by
the
way
brought
me
into
contact
with
more
than
one
man
who
was
afterward
a
valued
friend
and
on
the
suggestion
of
carroll
wright
i
appointed
as
assistant
recorders
to
the
commission
charles
neill
whom
i
afterward
made
labor
commissioner
to
succeed
wright
himself
and
edward
moseley
was
the
center
of
the
strike
and
the
man
in
who
helped
me
most
was
father
curran
i
grew
to
know
and
trust
and
believe
in
him
and
throughout
my
term
in
office
and
afterward
he
was
not
only
my
stanch
friend
but
one
of
the
men
by
whose
advice
and
counsel
i
profited
most
in
matters
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
miners
and
their
families
i
was
greatly
relieved
at
the
result
for
more
than
one
reason
of
course
first
and
foremost
my
concern
was
to
avert
a
frightful
calamity
to
the
united
states
in
the
next
place
i
was
anxious
to
save
the
great
coal
operators
and
all
of
the
class
of
big
propertied
men
of
which
they
were
members
from
the
dreadful
punishment
which
their
own
folly
would
have
brought
on
them
if
i
had
not
acted
and
one
of
the
exasperating
things
was
that
they
were
so
blinded
that
they
could
not
see
that
i
was
trying
to
save
them
from
themselves
and
to
avert
not
only
for
their
sakes
but
for
the
sake
of
the
country
the
excesses
which
would
have
been
indulged
in
at
their
expense
if
they
had
longer
persisted
in
their
conduct
the
great
anthracite
strike
of
left
an
indelible
impress
upon
the
people
of
the
united
states
it
showed
clearly
to
all
wise
and
men
that
the
labor
problem
in
this
country
had
entered
upon
a
new
phase
industry
had
grown
great
financial
corporations
doing
a
and
even
a
business
had
taken
the
place
of
the
smaller
concerns
of
an
earlier
time
the
old
familiar
intimate
relations
between
employer
and
employee
were
passing
a
few
generations
before
the
boss
had
known
every
man
in
his
shop
he
called
his
men
bill
tom
dick
john
he
inquired
after
their
wives
and
babies
he
swapped
jokes
and
stories
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
tobacco
with
them
in
the
small
establishment
there
had
been
a
friendly
human
relationship
between
employer
and
employee
there
was
no
such
relation
between
the
great
railway
magnates
who
controlled
the
anthracite
industry
and
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
who
worked
in
their
mines
or
the
half
million
women
and
children
who
were
dependent
upon
these
miners
for
their
daily
bread
very
few
of
these
mine
workers
had
ever
seen
for
instance
the
president
of
the
reading
railroad
had
they
seen
him
many
of
them
could
not
have
spoken
to
him
for
tens
of
thousands
of
the
mine
workers
were
recent
immigrants
who
did
not
understand
the
language
which
he
spoke
and
who
spoke
a
language
which
he
could
not
understand
again
a
few
generations
ago
an
american
workman
could
have
saved
money
gone
west
and
taken
up
a
homestead
now
the
free
lands
were
gone
in
earlier
days
a
man
who
began
with
pick
and
shovel
might
have
come
to
own
a
mine
that
outlet
too
was
now
closed
as
regards
the
immense
majority
and
few
if
any
of
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
mine
workers
could
ever
aspire
to
enter
the
small
circle
of
men
who
held
in
their
grasp
the
great
anthracite
industry
the
majority
of
the
men
who
earned
wages
in
the
coal
industry
if
they
wished
to
progress
at
all
were
compelled
to
progress
not
by
ceasing
to
be
but
by
improving
the
conditions
under
which
all
the
in
all
the
industries
of
the
country
lived
and
worked
as
well
of
course
as
improving
their
own
individual
efficiency
another
change
which
had
come
about
as
a
result
of
the
foregoing
was
a
crass
inequality
in
the
bargaining
relation
between
the
employer
and
the
individual
employee
standing
alone
the
great
and
companies
which
employed
their
tens
of
thousands
could
easily
dispense
with
the
services
of
any
particular
miner
the
miner
on
the
other
hand
however
expert
could
not
dispense
with
the
companies
he
needed
a
job
his
wife
and
children
would
starve
if
he
did
not
get
one
what
the
miner
had
to
sell
his
labor
was
a
perishable
commodity
the
labor
of
if
not
sold
was
lost
forever
moreover
his
labor
was
not
like
most
commodities
a
mere
thing
it
was
part
of
a
living
breathing
human
being
the
workman
saw
and
all
citizens
who
gave
earnest
thought
to
the
matter
saw
that
the
labor
problem
was
not
only
an
economic
but
also
a
moral
a
human
problem
individually
the
miners
were
impotent
when
they
sought
to
enter
a
with
the
great
companies
they
could
make
fair
terms
only
by
uniting
into
trade
unions
to
bargain
collectively
the
men
were
forced
to
cooperate
to
secure
not
only
their
economic
but
their
simple
human
rights
they
like
other
workmen
were
compelled
by
the
very
conditions
under
which
they
lived
to
unite
in
unions
of
their
industry
or
trade
and
these
unions
were
bound
to
grow
in
size
in
strength
and
in
power
for
good
and
evil
as
the
industries
in
which
the
men
were
employed
grew
larger
and
larger
a
democracy
can
be
such
in
fact
only
if
there
is
some
rough
approximation
in
similarity
in
stature
among
the
men
composing
it
one
of
us
can
deal
in
our
private
lives
with
the
grocer
or
the
butcher
or
the
carpenter
or
the
chicken
raiser
or
if
we
are
the
grocer
or
carpenter
or
butcher
or
farmer
we
can
deal
with
our
customers
because
are
all
of
about
the
same
therefore
a
simple
and
poor
society
can
exist
as
a
democracy
on
a
basis
of
sheer
individualism
but
a
rich
and
complex
industrial
society
can
not
so
exist
for
some
individuals
and
especially
those
artificial
individuals
called
corporations
become
so
very
big
that
the
ordinary
individual
is
utterly
dwarfed
beside
them
and
can
not
deal
with
them
on
terms
of
equality
it
therefore
becomes
necessary
for
these
ordinary
individuals
to
combine
in
their
turn
first
in
order
to
act
in
their
collective
capacity
through
that
biggest
of
all
combinations
called
the
government
and
second
to
act
also
in
their
own
through
private
combinations
such
as
associations
and
trade
unions
this
the
great
coal
operators
did
not
see
they
did
not
see
that
their
property
rights
which
they
so
stoutly
defended
were
of
the
same
texture
as
were
the
human
rights
which
they
so
blindly
and
hotly
denied
they
did
not
see
that
the
power
which
they
exercised
by
representing
their
stockholders
was
of
the
same
texture
as
the
power
which
the
union
leaders
demanded
of
representing
the
workmen
who
had
democratically
elected
them
they
did
not
see
that
the
right
to
use
one
property
as
one
will
can
be
maintained
only
so
long
as
it
is
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
certain
fundamental
human
rights
of
the
rights
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
or
as
we
may
restate
them
in
these
later
days
of
the
rights
of
the
worker
to
a
living
wage
to
reasonable
hours
of
labor
to
decent
working
and
living
conditions
to
freedom
of
thought
and
speech
and
industrial
representation
in
short
to
a
measure
of
industrial
democracy
and
in
return
for
his
arduous
toil
to
a
worthy
and
decent
life
according
to
american
standards
still
another
thing
these
great
business
leaders
did
not
see
they
did
not
see
that
both
their
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
workers
must
be
accommodated
and
if
need
be
subordinated
to
the
fundamental
permanent
interests
of
the
whole
community
no
man
and
no
group
of
men
may
so
exercise
their
rights
as
to
deprive
the
nation
of
the
things
which
are
necessary
and
vital
to
the
common
life
a
strike
which
ties
up
the
coal
supplies
of
a
whole
section
is
a
strike
invested
with
a
public
interest
so
great
was
that
public
interest
in
the
coal
strike
of
so
deeply
and
strongly
did
i
feel
the
wave
of
indignation
which
swept
over
the
whole
country
that
had
i
not
succeeded
in
my
efforts
to
induce
the
operators
to
listen
to
reason
i
should
reluctantly
but
none
the
less
decisively
have
taken
a
step
which
would
have
brought
down
upon
my
head
the
execrations
of
many
of
the
captains
of
industry
as
well
as
of
sundry
respectable
newspapers
who
dutifully
take
their
cue
from
them
as
a
man
should
be
judged
by
his
intentions
as
well
as
by
his
actions
i
will
give
here
the
story
of
the
intervention
that
never
happened
while
the
coal
operators
were
exulting
over
the
fact
that
they
had
turned
down
the
miners
and
the
president
there
arose
in
all
parts
of
the
country
an
outburst
of
wrath
so
universal
that
even
so
naturally
conservative
a
man
as
grover
cleveland
wrote
to
me
expressing
his
sympathy
with
the
course
i
was
following
his
indignation
at
the
conduct
of
the
operators
and
his
hope
that
i
would
devise
some
method
of
effective
action
in
my
own
mind
i
was
already
planning
effective
action
but
it
was
of
a
very
drastic
character
and
i
did
not
wish
to
take
it
until
the
failure
of
all
other
expedients
had
rendered
it
necessary
above
all
i
did
not
wish
to
talk
about
it
until
and
unless
i
actually
acted
i
had
definitely
determined
that
somehow
or
other
act
i
would
that
somehow
or
other
the
coal
famine
should
be
broken
to
accomplish
this
end
it
was
necessary
that
the
mines
should
be
run
and
if
i
could
get
no
voluntary
agreement
between
the
contending
sides
that
an
arbitration
commission
should
be
appointed
which
would
command
such
public
confidence
as
to
enable
me
without
too
much
difficulty
to
enforce
its
terms
upon
both
parties
cleveland
letter
not
merely
gratified
me
but
gave
me
the
chance
to
secure
him
as
head
of
the
arbitration
commission
i
at
once
wrote
him
stating
that
i
would
very
probably
have
to
appoint
an
arbitration
commission
or
investigating
commission
to
look
into
the
matter
and
decide
on
the
rights
of
the
case
whether
or
not
the
operators
asked
for
or
agreed
to
abide
by
the
decisions
of
such
a
commission
and
that
i
would
ask
him
to
accept
the
chief
place
on
the
commission
he
answered
that
he
would
do
so
i
picked
out
several
men
for
other
positions
on
the
commission
meanwhile
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
had
all
the
pennsylvania
militia
in
the
anthracite
region
although
without
any
effect
upon
the
resumption
of
mining
the
method
of
action
upon
which
i
had
determined
in
the
last
resort
was
to
get
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
to
ask
me
to
keep
order
then
i
would
put
in
the
army
under
the
command
of
some
general
i
would
instruct
this
general
to
keep
absolute
order
taking
any
steps
whatever
that
was
necessary
to
prevent
interference
by
the
strikers
or
their
sympathizers
with
men
who
wanted
to
work
i
would
also
instruct
him
to
dispossess
the
operators
and
run
the
mines
as
a
receiver
until
such
time
as
the
commission
might
make
its
report
and
until
i
as
president
might
issue
further
orders
in
view
of
this
report
i
had
to
find
a
man
who
possessed
the
necessary
good
sense
judgment
and
nerve
to
act
in
such
event
he
was
ready
to
hand
in
the
person
of
schofield
i
sent
for
him
telling
him
that
if
i
had
to
make
use
of
him
it
would
be
because
the
crisis
was
only
less
serious
than
that
of
the
civil
war
that
the
action
taken
would
be
practically
a
war
measure
and
that
if
i
sent
him
he
must
act
in
a
purely
military
capacity
under
me
as
paying
no
heed
to
any
authority
judicial
or
otherwise
except
mine
he
was
a
fine
fellow
a
most
old
boy
with
side
whiskers
and
a
black
without
any
of
the
outward
aspect
of
the
conventional
military
dictator
but
in
both
nerve
and
judgment
he
was
all
right
and
he
answered
quietly
that
if
i
gave
the
order
he
would
take
possession
of
the
mines
and
would
guarantee
to
open
them
and
to
run
them
without
permitting
any
interference
either
by
the
owners
or
the
strikers
or
anybody
else
so
long
as
i
told
him
to
stay
i
then
saw
senator
quay
who
like
every
other
responsible
man
in
high
position
was
greatly
wrought
up
over
the
condition
of
things
i
told
him
that
he
need
be
under
no
alarm
as
to
the
problem
not
being
solved
that
i
was
going
to
make
another
effort
to
get
the
operators
and
miners
to
come
together
but
that
i
would
solve
the
problem
in
any
event
and
get
coal
that
however
i
did
not
wish
to
tell
him
anything
of
the
details
of
my
intention
but
merely
to
have
him
arrange
that
whenever
i
gave
the
word
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
should
request
me
to
intervene
that
when
this
was
done
i
would
be
responsible
for
all
that
followed
and
would
guarantee
that
the
coal
famine
would
end
forthwith
the
senator
made
no
inquiry
or
comment
and
merely
told
me
that
he
in
his
turn
would
guarantee
that
the
governor
would
request
my
intervention
the
minute
i
asked
that
the
request
be
made
these
negotiations
were
concluded
with
the
utmost
secrecy
general
schofield
being
the
only
man
who
knew
exactly
what
my
plan
was
and
senator
quay
two
members
of
my
cabinet
and
cleveland
and
the
other
men
whom
i
proposed
to
put
on
the
commission
the
only
other
men
who
knew
that
i
had
a
plan
as
i
have
above
outlined
my
efforts
to
bring
about
an
agreement
between
the
operators
and
miners
were
finally
successful
i
was
glad
not
to
have
to
take
possession
of
the
mines
on
my
own
initiative
by
means
of
general
schofield
and
the
regulars
i
was
all
ready
to
act
and
would
have
done
so
without
the
slightest
hesitation
or
a
moment
delay
if
the
negotiations
had
fallen
through
and
my
action
would
have
been
entirely
effective
but
it
is
never
well
to
take
drastic
action
if
the
result
can
be
achieved
with
equal
efficiency
in
less
drastic
fashion
and
although
this
was
a
minor
consideration
i
was
personally
saved
a
good
deal
of
future
trouble
by
being
able
to
avoid
this
drastic
action
at
the
time
i
should
have
been
almost
unanimously
supported
with
the
famine
upon
them
the
people
would
not
have
tolerated
any
conduct
that
would
have
thwarted
what
i
was
doing
probably
no
man
in
congress
and
no
man
in
the
pennsylvania
state
legislature
would
have
raised
his
voice
against
me
although
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
muttering
nothing
would
have
been
done
to
interfere
with
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
i
had
devised
the
solution
was
accomplished
and
the
problem
ceased
to
be
a
once
this
was
done
and
when
people
were
no
longer
afraid
of
a
coal
famine
and
began
to
forget
that
they
ever
had
been
afraid
of
it
and
to
be
indifferent
as
regards
the
consequences
to
those
who
put
an
end
to
it
then
my
enemies
would
have
plucked
up
heart
and
begun
a
campaign
against
me
i
doubt
if
they
could
have
accomplished
much
anyway
for
the
only
effective
remedy
against
me
would
have
been
impeachment
and
that
they
would
not
have
ventured
to
try
one
of
my
appointees
on
the
anthracite
strike
commission
was
judge
george
gray
of
delaware
a
democrat
whose
standing
in
the
country
was
second
only
to
that
of
grover
cleveland
a
year
later
he
commented
on
my
action
as
follows
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
confronted
in
october
by
the
existence
of
a
crisis
more
grave
and
threatening
than
any
that
had
occurred
since
the
civil
war
i
mean
that
the
cessation
of
mining
in
the
anthracite
country
brought
about
by
the
dispute
between
the
miners
and
those
who
controlled
the
greatest
natural
monopoly
in
this
country
and
perhaps
in
the
world
had
brought
upon
more
than
of
the
american
people
a
condition
of
deprivation
of
one
of
the
necessaries
of
life
and
the
probable
continuance
of
the
dispute
threatened
not
only
the
comfort
and
health
but
the
safety
and
good
order
of
the
nation
he
was
without
legal
or
constitutional
power
to
interfere
but
his
position
as
president
of
the
united
states
gave
him
an
influence
a
leadership
as
first
citizen
of
the
republic
that
enabled
him
to
appeal
to
the
patriotism
and
good
sense
of
the
parties
to
the
controversy
and
to
place
upon
them
the
moral
coercion
of
public
opinion
to
agree
to
an
arbitrament
of
the
strike
then
existing
and
threatening
consequences
so
direful
to
the
whole
country
he
acted
promptly
and
courageously
and
in
so
doing
averted
the
dangers
to
which
i
have
alluded
so
far
from
interfering
or
infringing
upon
property
rights
the
presidents
action
tended
to
conserve
them
the
peculiar
situation
as
regards
the
anthracite
coal
interest
was
that
they
controlled
a
natural
monopoly
of
a
product
necessary
to
the
comfort
and
to
the
very
life
of
a
large
portion
of
the
people
a
prolonged
deprivation
of
the
enjoyment
of
this
necessary
of
life
would
have
tended
to
precipitate
an
attack
upon
these
property
rights
of
which
you
speak
for
after
all
it
is
vain
to
deny
that
this
property
so
peculiar
in
its
conditions
and
which
is
properly
spoken
of
as
a
natural
monopoly
is
affected
with
a
public
interest
i
do
not
think
that
any
president
ever
acted
more
wisely
courageously
or
promptly
in
a
national
crisis
roosevelt
deserves
unstinted
praise
for
what
he
did
they
would
doubtless
have
acted
precisely
as
they
acted
as
regards
the
acquisition
of
the
panama
canal
zone
in
and
the
stoppage
of
the
panic
of
by
my
action
in
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
matter
nothing
could
have
made
the
american
people
surrender
the
canal
zone
but
after
it
was
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
canal
was
under
way
then
they
settled
down
to
comfortable
acceptance
of
the
accomplished
fact
and
as
their
own
interests
were
no
longer
in
jeopardy
they
paid
no
heed
to
the
men
who
attacked
me
because
of
what
i
had
done
and
also
continue
to
attack
me
although
they
are
exceedingly
careful
not
to
propose
to
right
the
wrong
in
the
only
proper
way
if
it
really
was
a
wrong
by
replacing
the
old
republic
of
panama
under
the
tyranny
of
colombia
and
giving
colombia
sole
or
joint
ownership
of
the
canal
itself
in
the
case
of
the
panic
of
as
in
the
case
of
panama
what
i
did
was
not
only
done
openly
but
depended
for
its
effect
upon
being
done
and
with
the
widest
advertisement
nobody
in
congress
ventured
to
make
an
objection
at
the
time
no
serious
leader
outside
made
any
objection
the
one
concern
of
everybody
was
to
stop
the
panic
and
everybody
was
overjoyed
that
i
was
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
of
stopping
it
upon
my
own
shoulders
but
a
few
months
afterward
the
panic
was
a
thing
of
the
past
people
forgot
the
frightful
condition
of
alarm
in
which
they
had
been
they
no
longer
had
a
personal
interest
in
preventing
any
interference
with
the
stoppage
of
the
panic
then
the
men
who
had
not
dared
to
raise
their
voices
until
all
danger
was
past
came
bravely
forth
from
their
hiding
places
and
denounced
the
action
which
had
saved
them
they
had
kept
a
hushed
silence
when
there
was
danger
they
made
clamorous
outcry
when
there
was
safety
in
doing
so
just
the
same
course
would
have
been
followed
in
connection
with
the
anthracite
coal
strike
if
i
had
been
obliged
to
act
in
the
fashion
i
intended
to
act
had
i
failed
to
secure
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
miners
and
the
operators
even
as
it
was
my
action
was
remembered
with
rancor
by
the
heads
of
the
great
moneyed
interests
and
as
time
went
by
was
assailed
with
constantly
increasing
vigor
by
the
newspapers
these
men
controlled
had
i
been
forced
to
take
possession
of
the
mines
these
men
and
the
politicians
hostile
to
me
would
have
waited
until
the
popular
alarm
was
over
and
the
popular
needs
met
just
as
they
waited
in
the
case
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
and
then
they
would
have
attacked
me
precisely
as
they
did
attack
me
as
regards
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
of
course
in
labor
controversies
it
was
not
always
possible
to
champion
the
cause
of
the
workers
because
in
many
cases
strikes
were
called
which
were
utterly
unwarranted
and
were
fought
by
methods
which
can
not
be
too
harshly
condemned
no
straightforward
man
can
believe
and
no
fearless
man
will
assert
that
a
trade
union
is
always
right
that
man
is
an
unworthy
public
servant
who
by
speech
or
silence
by
direct
statement
or
cowardly
evasion
invariably
throws
the
weight
of
his
influence
on
the
side
of
the
trade
union
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
it
has
occasionally
been
my
duty
to
give
utterance
to
the
feelings
of
all
right
thinking
men
by
expressing
the
most
emphatic
disapproval
of
unwise
or
even
immoral
notions
by
representatives
of
labor
the
man
is
no
true
democrat
and
if
an
american
is
unworthy
of
the
traditions
of
his
country
who
in
problems
calling
for
the
exercise
of
a
moral
judgment
fails
to
take
his
stand
on
conduct
and
not
on
class
there
are
good
and
bad
just
as
there
are
good
and
bad
employers
and
good
and
bad
men
of
small
means
and
of
large
means
alike
but
a
willingness
to
do
equal
and
exact
justice
to
all
citizens
irrespective
of
race
creed
section
or
economic
interest
and
position
does
not
imply
a
failure
to
recognize
the
enormous
economic
political
and
moral
possibilities
of
the
trade
union
just
as
democratic
government
can
not
be
condemned
because
of
errors
and
even
crimes
committed
by
men
democratically
elected
so
must
not
be
condemned
because
of
errors
or
crimes
of
occasional
leaders
the
problem
lies
deeper
while
we
must
repress
all
illegalities
and
discourage
all
immoralities
whether
of
labor
organizations
or
of
corporations
we
must
recognize
the
fact
that
the
organization
of
labor
into
trade
unions
and
federations
is
necessary
is
beneficent
and
is
one
of
the
greatest
possible
agencies
in
the
attainment
of
a
true
industrial
as
well
as
a
true
political
democracy
in
the
united
states
this
is
a
fact
which
many
people
even
do
not
understand
they
do
not
understand
that
the
labor
problem
is
a
human
and
a
moral
as
well
as
an
economic
problem
that
a
fall
in
wages
an
increase
in
hours
a
deterioration
of
labor
conditions
mean
wholesale
moral
as
well
as
economic
degeneration
and
the
needless
sacrifice
of
human
lives
and
human
happiness
while
a
rise
of
wages
a
lessening
of
hours
a
bettering
of
conditions
mean
an
intellectual
moral
and
social
uplift
of
millions
of
american
men
and
women
there
are
employers
who
like
the
great
coal
operators
speak
as
though
they
were
lords
of
these
countless
armies
of
americans
who
toil
in
factory
in
shop
in
mill
and
in
the
dark
places
under
the
earth
they
fail
to
see
that
all
these
men
have
the
right
and
the
duty
to
combine
to
protect
themselves
and
their
families
from
want
and
degradation
they
fail
to
see
that
the
nation
and
the
government
within
the
range
of
fair
play
and
a
just
administration
of
the
law
must
inevitably
sympathize
with
the
men
who
have
nothing
but
their
wages
with
the
men
who
are
struggling
for
a
decent
life
as
opposed
to
men
however
honorable
who
are
merely
fighting
for
larger
profits
and
an
autocratic
control
of
big
business
each
man
should
have
all
he
earns
whether
by
brain
or
body
and
the
director
the
great
industrial
leader
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
earners
and
should
have
a
proportional
reward
but
no
man
should
live
on
the
earnings
of
another
and
there
should
not
be
too
gross
inequality
between
service
and
reward
there
are
many
men
men
of
integrity
and
intelligence
who
honestly
believe
that
we
must
go
back
to
the
labor
conditions
of
half
a
century
ago
they
are
opposed
to
trade
unions
root
and
branch
they
note
the
unworthy
conduct
of
many
labor
leaders
they
find
instances
of
bad
work
by
union
men
of
a
voluntary
restriction
of
output
of
vexations
and
violent
strikes
of
jurisdictional
disputes
between
unions
which
often
disastrously
involve
the
best
intentioned
and
fairest
of
employers
all
these
things
occur
and
should
be
repressed
but
the
same
critic
of
the
trade
union
might
find
equal
causes
of
complaint
against
individual
employers
of
labor
or
even
against
great
associations
of
manufacturers
he
might
find
many
instances
of
an
unwarranted
cutting
of
wages
of
flagrant
violations
of
factory
laws
and
tenement
house
laws
of
the
deliberate
and
systematic
cheating
of
employees
by
means
of
truck
stores
of
the
speeding
up
of
work
to
a
point
which
is
fatal
to
the
health
of
the
workman
of
the
sweating
of
workers
of
the
drafting
of
feeble
little
children
into
dusty
workshops
of
of
putting
spies
into
union
meetings
and
of
the
employment
in
strike
times
of
vicious
and
desperate
ruffians
who
are
neither
better
nor
worse
than
are
the
thugs
who
are
occasionally
employed
by
unions
under
the
sinister
name
entertainment
committees
i
believe
that
the
overwhelming
majority
both
of
workmen
and
of
employers
are
peaceful
and
honorable
citizens
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
just
to
lay
up
the
errors
and
wrongs
of
individuals
to
the
entire
group
to
which
they
belong
i
also
think
and
this
is
a
belief
which
has
been
borne
upon
me
through
many
years
of
practical
experience
that
the
trade
union
is
growing
constantly
in
wisdom
as
well
as
in
power
and
is
becoming
one
of
the
most
efficient
agencies
toward
the
solution
of
our
industrial
problems
the
elimination
of
poverty
and
of
industrial
disease
and
accidents
the
lessening
of
unemployment
the
achievement
of
industrial
democracy
and
the
attainment
of
a
larger
measure
of
social
and
industrial
justice
if
i
were
a
factory
employee
a
workman
on
the
railroads
or
a
of
any
sort
i
would
undoubtedly
join
the
union
of
my
trade
if
i
disapproved
of
its
policy
i
would
join
in
order
to
fight
that
policy
if
the
union
leaders
were
dishonest
i
would
join
in
order
to
put
them
out
i
believe
in
the
union
and
i
believe
that
all
men
who
are
benefited
by
the
union
are
morally
bound
to
help
to
the
extent
of
their
power
in
the
common
interests
advanced
by
the
union
nevertheless
irrespective
of
whether
a
man
should
or
should
not
and
does
or
does
not
join
the
union
of
his
trade
all
the
rights
privileges
and
immunities
of
that
man
as
an
american
and
as
a
citizen
should
be
safeguarded
and
upheld
by
the
law
we
dare
not
make
an
outlaw
of
any
individual
or
any
group
whatever
his
or
its
opinions
or
professions
the
like
the
unionist
must
be
protected
in
all
his
legal
rights
by
the
full
weight
and
power
of
the
law
this
question
came
up
before
me
in
the
shape
of
the
right
of
a
printer
named
miller
to
hold
his
position
in
the
government
printing
office
as
i
said
before
i
believe
in
trade
unions
i
always
prefer
to
see
a
union
shop
but
any
private
preferences
can
not
control
my
public
actions
the
government
can
recognize
neither
union
men
nor
men
as
such
and
is
bound
to
treat
both
exactly
alike
in
the
government
printing
office
not
many
months
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
presidential
campaign
of
when
i
was
up
for
reelection
i
discovered
that
a
man
had
been
dismissed
because
he
did
not
belong
to
the
union
i
reinstated
him
gompers
the
president
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
with
various
members
of
the
executive
council
of
that
body
called
upon
me
to
protest
on
september
and
i
answered
them
as
follows
i
thank
you
and
your
committee
for
your
courtesy
and
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
you
it
will
always
be
a
pleasure
to
see
you
or
any
representative
of
your
organizations
or
of
your
federation
as
a
whole
as
regards
the
miller
case
i
have
little
to
add
to
what
i
have
already
said
in
dealing
with
it
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
am
dealing
purely
with
the
relation
of
the
government
to
its
employees
i
must
govern
my
action
by
the
laws
of
the
land
which
i
am
sworn
to
administer
and
which
differentiate
any
case
in
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
a
party
from
all
other
cases
whatsoever
these
laws
are
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
people
and
can
not
and
must
not
be
construed
as
permitting
the
crimination
against
some
of
the
people
i
am
president
of
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
creed
color
birthplace
occupation
or
social
condition
my
aim
is
to
do
equal
and
exact
justice
as
among
them
all
in
the
employment
and
dismissal
of
men
in
the
government
service
i
can
no
more
recognize
the
fact
that
a
man
does
or
does
not
belong
to
a
union
as
being
for
or
against
him
than
i
can
recognize
the
fact
that
he
is
a
protestant
or
a
catholic
a
jew
or
a
gentile
as
being
for
or
against
him
in
the
communications
sent
me
by
various
labor
organizations
protesting
against
the
retention
of
miller
in
the
government
printing
office
the
grounds
alleged
are
twofold
that
he
is
a
man
that
he
is
not
personally
fit
the
question
of
his
personal
fitness
is
one
to
be
settled
in
the
routine
of
administrative
detail
and
can
not
be
allowed
to
conflict
with
or
to
complicate
the
larger
question
of
governmental
discrimination
for
or
against
him
or
any
other
man
because
he
is
or
is
not
a
member
of
a
union
this
is
the
only
question
now
before
me
for
decision
and
as
to
this
my
decision
is
final
because
of
things
i
have
done
on
behalf
of
justice
to
the
workingman
i
have
often
been
called
a
socialist
usually
i
have
not
taken
the
trouble
even
to
notice
the
epithet
i
am
not
afraid
of
names
and
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
fear
to
do
what
is
right
because
some
one
else
will
confound
me
with
partisans
with
whose
principles
i
am
not
in
accord
moreover
i
know
that
many
american
socialists
are
and
honorable
citizens
who
in
reality
are
merely
radical
social
reformers
they
are
oppressed
by
the
brutalities
and
industrial
injustices
which
we
see
everywhere
about
us
when
i
recall
how
often
i
have
seen
socialists
and
ardent
working
side
by
side
for
some
specific
measure
of
social
or
industrial
reform
and
how
i
have
found
opposed
to
them
on
the
side
of
privilege
many
shrill
reactionaries
who
insist
on
calling
all
reformers
socialists
i
refuse
to
be
by
having
this
title
mistakenly
applied
to
me
none
the
less
without
impugning
their
motives
i
do
disagree
most
emphatically
with
both
the
fundamental
philosophy
and
the
proposed
remedies
of
the
marxian
socialists
these
socialists
are
unalterably
opposed
to
our
whole
industrial
system
they
believe
that
the
payment
of
wages
means
everywhere
and
inevitably
an
exploitation
of
the
laborer
by
the
employer
and
that
this
leads
inevitably
to
a
class
war
between
those
two
groups
or
as
they
would
say
between
the
capitalists
and
the
proletariat
they
assert
that
this
class
war
is
already
upon
us
and
can
only
be
ended
when
capitalism
is
entirely
destroyed
and
all
the
machines
mills
mines
railroads
and
other
private
property
used
in
production
are
confiscated
expropriated
or
taken
over
by
the
workers
they
do
not
as
a
rule
claim
although
some
of
the
sinister
extremists
among
them
do
that
there
is
and
must
be
a
continual
struggle
between
two
great
classes
whose
interests
are
opposed
and
can
not
be
reconciled
in
this
war
they
insist
that
the
whole
government
national
state
and
local
is
on
the
side
of
the
employers
and
is
used
by
them
against
the
workmen
and
that
our
law
and
even
our
common
morality
are
class
weapons
like
a
policeman
club
or
a
gatling
gun
i
have
never
believed
and
do
not
believe
that
such
a
class
war
is
upon
us
or
need
ever
be
upon
us
nor
do
i
believe
that
the
interests
of
and
employers
can
not
be
harmonized
compromised
and
adjusted
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
have
certain
different
economic
interests
from
let
us
say
manufacturers
or
importers
just
as
farmers
have
different
interests
from
sailors
and
fishermen
from
bankers
there
is
no
reason
why
any
of
these
economic
groups
should
not
consult
their
group
interests
by
any
legitimate
means
and
with
due
regard
to
the
common
overlying
interests
of
all
i
do
not
even
deny
that
the
majority
of
because
they
have
less
property
and
less
industrial
security
than
others
and
because
they
do
not
own
the
machinery
with
which
they
work
as
does
the
farmer
are
perhaps
in
greater
need
of
acting
together
than
are
other
groups
in
the
community
but
i
do
insist
and
i
believe
that
the
great
majority
of
take
the
same
view
that
employers
and
employees
have
overwhelming
interests
in
common
both
as
partners
in
industry
and
as
citizens
of
the
republic
and
that
where
these
interests
are
apart
they
can
be
adjusted
by
so
altering
our
laws
and
their
interpretation
as
to
secure
to
all
members
of
the
community
social
and
industrial
justice
i
have
always
maintained
that
our
worst
revolutionaries
are
those
reactionaries
who
do
not
see
and
will
not
admit
that
there
is
any
need
for
change
such
men
seem
to
believe
that
the
four
and
a
half
million
progressive
voters
who
in
registered
their
solemn
protest
against
our
social
and
industrial
injustices
are
anarchists
who
are
not
willing
to
let
ill
enough
alone
if
these
reactionaries
had
lived
at
an
earlier
time
in
our
history
they
would
have
advocated
sedition
laws
opposed
free
speech
and
free
assembly
and
voted
against
free
schools
free
access
by
settlers
to
the
public
lands
mechanics
lien
laws
the
prohibition
of
truck
stores
and
the
abolition
of
imprisonment
for
debt
and
they
are
the
men
who
oppose
minimum
wage
laws
insurance
of
workmen
against
the
ills
of
industrial
life
and
the
reform
of
our
legislators
and
our
courts
which
can
alone
render
such
measures
possible
some
of
these
reactionaries
are
not
bad
men
but
merely
shortsighted
and
belated
it
is
these
reactionaries
however
who
by
standing
pat
on
industrial
injustice
incite
inevitably
to
industrial
revolt
and
it
is
only
we
who
advocate
political
and
industrial
democracy
who
render
possible
the
progress
of
our
american
industry
on
large
constructive
lines
with
a
minimum
of
friction
because
with
a
maximum
of
justice
everything
possible
should
be
done
to
secure
the
fair
treatment
there
should
be
an
increased
wage
for
the
worker
of
increased
productiveness
everything
possible
should
be
done
against
the
capitalist
who
strives
not
to
reward
special
efficiency
but
to
use
it
as
an
excuse
for
reducing
the
reward
of
moderate
efficiency
the
capitalist
is
an
unworthy
citizen
who
pays
the
efficient
man
no
more
than
he
has
been
content
to
pay
the
average
man
and
nevertheless
reduces
the
wage
of
the
average
man
and
effort
should
be
made
by
the
government
to
check
and
punish
him
when
machinery
is
introduced
special
care
should
be
taken
by
the
government
if
necessary
to
see
that
the
gets
his
share
of
the
benefit
and
that
it
is
not
all
absorbed
by
the
employer
or
capitalist
the
following
case
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
illustrates
what
i
mean
a
number
of
new
machines
were
installed
in
a
certain
shoe
factory
and
as
a
result
there
was
a
heavy
increase
in
production
even
though
there
was
no
increase
in
the
labor
force
some
of
the
workmen
were
instructed
in
the
use
of
these
machines
by
special
demonstrators
sent
out
by
the
makers
of
the
machines
these
men
by
reason
of
their
special
aptitudes
and
the
fact
that
they
were
not
called
upon
to
operate
the
machines
continuously
nine
hours
every
day
week
in
and
week
out
but
only
for
an
hour
or
so
at
special
times
were
naturally
able
to
run
the
machines
at
their
maximum
capacity
when
these
demonstrators
had
left
the
factory
and
the
company
own
employees
had
become
used
to
operating
the
machines
at
a
fair
rate
of
speed
the
foreman
of
the
establishment
gradually
speeded
the
machines
and
demanded
a
larger
and
still
larger
output
constantly
endeavoring
to
drive
the
men
on
to
greater
exertions
even
with
a
slightly
less
maximum
capacity
the
introduction
of
this
machinery
resulted
in
a
great
increase
over
former
production
with
the
same
amount
of
labor
and
so
great
were
the
profits
from
the
business
in
the
following
two
years
as
to
equal
the
total
capitalized
stock
of
the
company
but
not
a
cent
got
into
the
pay
envelope
of
the
workmen
beyond
what
they
had
formerly
been
receiving
before
the
introduction
of
this
new
machinery
notwithstanding
that
it
had
meant
an
added
strain
physical
and
mental
upon
their
energies
and
that
they
were
forced
to
work
harder
than
ever
before
the
whole
of
the
increased
profits
remained
with
the
company
now
this
represented
an
increase
of
efficiency
with
a
positive
decrease
of
social
and
industrial
justice
the
increase
of
prosperity
which
came
from
increase
of
production
in
no
way
benefited
the
i
hold
that
they
were
treated
with
gross
injustice
and
that
society
acting
if
necessary
through
the
government
in
such
a
case
should
bend
its
energies
to
remedy
such
injustice
and
i
will
support
any
proper
legislation
that
will
aid
in
securing
the
desired
end
the
should
not
only
receive
fair
treatment
he
should
give
fair
treatment
in
order
that
prosperity
may
be
passed
around
it
is
necessary
that
the
prosperity
exist
in
order
that
labor
shall
receive
its
fair
share
in
the
division
of
reward
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
a
reward
to
divide
any
proposal
to
reduce
efficiency
by
insisting
that
the
most
efficient
shall
be
limited
in
their
output
to
what
the
least
efficient
can
do
is
a
proposal
to
limit
by
so
much
production
and
therefore
to
impoverish
by
so
much
the
public
and
specifically
to
reduce
the
amount
that
can
be
divided
among
the
producers
this
is
all
wrong
our
protest
must
be
against
unfair
division
of
the
reward
for
production
every
encouragement
should
be
given
the
business
man
the
employer
to
make
his
business
prosperous
and
therefore
to
earn
more
money
for
himself
and
in
like
fashion
every
encouragement
should
be
given
the
efficient
workman
we
must
always
keep
in
mind
that
to
reduce
the
amount
of
production
serves
merely
to
reduce
the
amount
that
is
to
be
divided
is
in
no
way
permanently
efficient
as
a
protest
against
unequal
distribution
and
is
permanently
detrimental
to
the
entire
community
but
increased
productiveness
is
not
secured
by
excessive
labor
amid
unhealthy
surroundings
the
contrary
is
true
shorter
hours
and
healthful
conditions
and
opportunity
for
the
to
make
more
money
and
the
chance
for
enjoyment
as
well
as
work
all
add
to
efficiency
my
contention
is
that
there
should
be
no
penalization
of
efficient
productiveness
brought
about
under
healthy
conditions
but
that
every
increase
of
production
brought
about
by
an
increase
in
efficiency
should
benefit
all
the
parties
to
it
including
as
well
as
employers
or
capitalists
men
who
work
with
their
hands
as
well
as
men
who
work
with
their
heads
with
the
western
federation
of
miners
i
more
than
once
had
serious
trouble
the
leaders
of
this
organization
had
preached
anarchy
and
certain
of
them
were
indicted
for
having
practiced
murder
in
the
case
of
governor
steunenberg
of
idaho
on
one
occasion
in
a
letter
or
speech
i
coupled
condemnation
of
these
labor
leaders
and
condemnation
of
certain
big
capitalists
describing
them
all
alike
as
undesirable
citizens
this
gave
great
offense
to
both
sides
the
open
attack
upon
me
was
made
for
the
most
part
either
by
the
new
york
newspapers
which
were
frankly
representatives
of
wall
street
or
else
by
those
and
miscalled
socialists
who
had
anarchistic
leanings
many
of
the
latter
sent
me
open
letters
of
denunciation
and
to
one
of
them
i
responded
as
follows
the
white
house
washington
april
dear
sir
i
have
received
your
letter
of
the
instant
in
which
you
enclose
the
draft
of
the
formal
letter
which
is
to
follow
i
have
been
notified
that
several
delegations
bearing
similar
requests
are
on
the
way
hither
in
the
letter
you
on
behalf
of
the
cook
county
conference
protest
against
certain
language
i
used
in
a
recent
letter
which
you
assert
to
be
designed
to
influence
the
course
of
justice
in
the
case
of
the
trial
for
murder
of
moyer
and
haywood
i
entirely
agree
with
you
that
it
is
improper
to
endeavor
to
influence
the
course
of
justice
whether
by
threats
or
in
any
similar
manner
for
this
reason
i
have
regretted
most
deeply
the
actions
of
such
organizations
as
your
own
in
undertaking
to
accomplish
this
very
result
in
the
very
case
of
which
you
speak
for
instance
your
letter
is
headed
cook
county
conference
with
the
headlines
can
not
will
not
and
shall
not
claim
our
brothers
this
shows
that
you
and
your
associates
are
not
demanding
a
fair
trial
or
working
for
a
fair
trial
but
are
announcing
in
advance
that
the
verdict
shall
only
be
one
way
and
that
you
will
not
tolerate
any
other
verdict
such
action
is
flagrant
in
its
impropriety
and
i
join
heartily
in
condemning
it
but
it
is
a
simple
absurdity
to
suppose
that
because
any
man
is
on
trial
for
a
given
offense
he
is
therefore
to
be
freed
from
all
criticism
upon
his
general
conduct
and
manner
of
life
in
my
letter
to
which
you
object
i
referred
to
a
certain
prominent
financier
harriman
on
the
one
hand
and
to
moyer
haywood
and
debs
on
the
other
as
being
equally
undesirable
citizens
it
is
as
foolish
to
assert
that
this
was
designed
to
influence
the
trial
of
moyer
and
haywood
as
to
assert
that
it
was
designed
to
influence
the
suits
that
have
been
brought
against
harriman
i
neither
expressed
nor
indicated
any
opinion
as
to
whether
moyer
and
haywood
were
guilty
of
the
murder
of
governor
steunenberg
if
they
are
guilty
they
certainly
ought
to
be
punished
if
they
are
not
guilty
they
certainly
ought
not
to
be
punished
but
no
possible
outcome
either
of
the
trial
or
the
suits
can
affect
my
judgment
as
to
the
undesirability
of
the
type
of
citizenship
of
those
whom
i
mentioned
moyer
haywood
and
debs
stand
as
representatives
of
those
men
who
have
done
as
much
to
discredit
the
labor
movement
as
the
worst
speculative
financiers
or
most
unscrupulous
employers
of
labor
and
debauchers
of
legislatures
have
done
to
discredit
honest
capitalists
and
business
men
they
stand
as
the
representatives
of
those
men
who
by
their
public
utterances
and
manifestoes
by
the
utterances
of
the
papers
they
control
or
inspire
and
by
the
words
and
deeds
of
those
associated
with
or
subordinated
to
them
habitually
appear
as
guilty
of
incitement
to
or
apology
for
bloodshed
and
violence
if
this
does
not
constitute
undesirable
citizenship
then
there
can
never
be
any
undesirable
citizens
the
men
whom
i
denounce
represent
the
men
who
have
abandoned
that
legitimate
movement
for
the
uplifting
of
labor
with
which
i
have
the
most
hearty
sympathy
they
have
adopted
practices
which
cut
them
off
from
those
who
lead
this
legitimate
movement
in
every
way
i
shall
support
the
and
upright
representatives
of
labor
and
in
no
way
can
i
better
support
them
than
by
drawing
the
sharpest
possible
line
between
them
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
those
preachers
of
violence
who
are
themselves
the
worst
foes
of
the
honest
laboring
man
let
me
repeat
my
deep
regret
that
any
body
of
men
should
so
far
forget
their
duty
to
the
country
as
to
endeavor
by
the
formation
of
societies
and
in
other
ways
to
influence
the
course
of
justice
in
this
matter
i
have
received
many
such
letters
as
yours
accompanying
them
were
newspaper
clippings
announcing
demonstrations
parades
and
designed
to
show
that
the
representatives
of
labor
without
regard
to
the
facts
demand
the
acquittal
of
haywood
and
moyer
such
meetings
can
of
course
be
designed
only
to
coerce
court
or
jury
in
rendering
a
verdict
and
they
therefore
deserve
all
the
condemnation
which
you
in
your
letters
say
should
be
awarded
to
those
who
endeavor
improperly
to
influence
the
course
of
justice
you
would
of
course
be
entirely
within
your
rights
if
you
merely
announced
that
you
thought
moyer
and
haywood
were
desirable
citizens
though
in
such
case
i
should
take
frank
issue
with
you
and
should
say
that
wholly
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
are
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
they
are
now
being
tried
they
represent
as
thoroughly
undesirable
a
type
of
citizenship
as
can
be
found
in
this
country
a
type
which
in
the
letter
to
which
you
so
unreasonably
take
exception
i
showed
not
to
be
confined
to
any
one
class
but
to
exist
among
some
representatives
of
great
capitalists
as
well
as
among
some
representatives
of
in
that
letter
i
condemned
both
types
certain
representatives
of
the
great
capitalists
in
turn
condemned
me
for
including
harriman
in
my
condemnation
of
moyer
and
haywood
certain
of
the
representatives
of
labor
in
their
turn
condemned
me
because
i
included
moyer
and
haywood
as
undesirable
citizens
together
with
harrison
i
am
as
profoundly
indifferent
to
the
condemnation
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
i
challenge
as
a
right
the
support
of
all
good
americans
whether
or
capitalists
whatever
their
occupation
or
creed
or
in
whatever
portion
of
the
country
they
live
when
i
condemn
both
the
types
of
bad
citizenship
which
i
have
held
up
to
reprobation
it
seems
to
be
a
mark
of
utter
insincerity
to
fail
thus
to
condemn
both
and
to
apologize
for
either
robs
the
man
thus
apologizing
of
all
right
to
condemn
any
wrongdoing
in
any
man
rich
or
poor
in
public
or
in
private
life
you
say
you
ask
for
a
square
deal
for
moyer
and
haywood
so
do
i
when
i
say
square
deal
i
mean
a
square
deal
to
every
one
it
is
equally
a
violation
of
the
policy
of
the
square
deal
for
a
capitalist
to
protest
against
denunciation
of
a
capitalist
who
is
guilty
of
wrongdoing
and
for
a
labor
leader
to
protest
against
the
denunciation
of
a
labor
leader
who
has
been
guilty
of
wrongdoing
i
stand
for
equal
justice
to
both
and
so
far
as
in
my
power
lies
i
shall
uphold
justice
whether
the
man
accused
of
guilt
has
behind
him
the
wealthiest
corporation
the
greatest
aggregations
of
riches
in
the
country
or
whether
he
has
behind
him
the
most
influential
labor
organization
in
the
country
i
treated
anarchists
and
the
and
dynamiting
gentry
precisely
as
i
treated
other
criminals
murder
is
murder
it
is
not
rendered
one
whit
better
by
the
allegation
that
it
is
committed
on
behalf
of
a
cause
it
is
true
that
law
and
order
are
not
all
sufficient
but
they
are
essential
lawlessness
and
murderous
violence
must
be
quelled
before
any
permanence
of
reform
can
be
obtained
yet
when
they
have
been
quelled
the
beneficiaries
of
the
enforcement
of
law
must
in
their
turn
be
taught
that
law
is
upheld
as
a
means
to
the
enforcement
of
justice
and
that
we
will
not
tolerate
its
being
turned
into
an
engine
of
injustice
and
oppression
the
fundamental
need
in
dealing
with
our
people
whether
laboring
men
or
others
is
not
charity
but
justice
we
must
all
work
in
common
for
the
common
end
of
helping
each
and
all
in
a
spirit
of
the
sanest
broadest
and
deepest
brotherhood
it
was
not
always
easy
to
avoid
feeling
very
deep
anger
with
the
selfishness
and
shown
both
by
the
representatives
of
certain
employers
organizations
and
by
certain
great
labor
federations
or
unions
one
such
employers
association
was
called
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
extreme
though
the
attacks
sometimes
made
upon
me
by
the
extreme
labor
organizations
were
they
were
not
quite
as
extreme
as
the
attacks
made
upon
me
by
the
head
of
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
and
as
regards
their
attitude
toward
legislation
i
came
to
the
conclusion
toward
the
end
of
my
term
that
the
latter
had
actually
gone
further
the
wrong
way
than
did
the
former
and
the
former
went
a
good
distance
also
the
opposition
of
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
to
every
rational
and
moderate
measure
for
benefiting
workingmen
such
as
measures
abolishing
child
labor
or
securing
workmen
compensation
caused
me
real
and
grave
concern
for
i
felt
that
it
was
ominous
of
evil
for
the
whole
country
to
have
men
who
ought
to
stand
high
in
wisdom
and
in
guiding
force
take
a
course
and
use
language
of
such
reactionary
type
as
directly
to
incite
revolution
for
this
is
what
the
extreme
reactionary
always
does
often
i
was
attacked
by
the
two
sides
at
once
in
the
spring
of
i
received
in
the
same
mail
a
letter
from
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
who
thought
that
i
had
been
unduly
hard
on
some
labor
men
and
a
letter
from
another
friend
the
head
of
a
great
corporation
who
complained
about
me
for
both
favoring
labor
and
speaking
against
large
fortunes
my
answers
ran
as
follows
april
personal
dear
in
one
of
my
last
letters
to
you
i
enclosed
you
a
copy
of
a
letter
of
mine
in
which
i
quoted
from
so
and
so
advocacy
of
murder
you
may
be
interested
to
know
that
he
and
his
brother
socialists
in
reality
anarchists
of
the
frankly
murderous
type
have
been
violently
attacking
my
speech
because
of
my
allusion
to
the
sympathy
expressed
for
murder
in
of
toledo
ohio
of
april
for
instance
the
attack
on
me
is
based
specifically
on
the
following
paragraph
of
my
speech
to
which
he
takes
violent
exception
we
can
no
more
and
no
less
afford
to
condone
evil
in
the
man
of
capital
than
evil
in
the
man
of
no
capital
the
wealthy
man
who
exults
because
there
is
a
failure
of
justice
in
the
effort
to
bring
some
trust
magnate
to
an
account
for
his
misdeeds
is
as
bad
as
and
no
worse
than
the
labor
leader
who
clamorously
strives
to
excite
a
foul
class
feeling
on
behalf
of
some
other
labor
leader
who
is
implicated
in
murder
one
attitude
is
as
bad
as
the
other
and
no
worse
in
each
case
the
accused
is
entitled
to
exact
justice
and
in
neither
case
is
there
need
of
action
by
others
which
can
be
construed
into
an
expression
of
sympathy
for
crime
remember
that
this
crowd
of
labor
leaders
have
done
all
in
their
power
to
overawe
the
executive
and
the
courts
of
idaho
on
behalf
of
men
accused
of
murder
and
beyond
question
inciters
of
murder
in
the
past
april
dear
i
wish
the
papers
had
given
more
prominence
to
what
i
said
as
to
the
murder
part
of
my
speech
but
oh
my
dear
sir
i
utterly
and
radically
disagree
with
you
in
what
you
say
about
large
fortunes
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
devise
some
scheme
to
make
it
increasingly
difficult
to
heap
them
up
beyond
a
certain
amount
as
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
such
a
scheme
are
very
great
let
us
at
least
prevent
their
being
bequeathed
after
death
or
given
during
life
to
any
one
man
in
excessive
amount
you
and
other
capitalist
friends
on
one
side
shy
off
at
what
i
say
against
them
have
you
seen
the
frantic
articles
against
me
by
the
anarchists
and
the
socialists
of
the
persuasion
on
the
other
side
because
of
what
i
said
in
my
speech
in
reference
to
those
who
in
effect
advocate
murder
on
another
occasion
i
was
vehemently
denounced
in
certain
capitalistic
papers
because
i
had
a
number
of
labor
leaders
including
miners
from
butte
lunch
with
me
at
the
white
house
and
this
at
the
very
time
that
the
western
federation
of
miners
was
most
ferocious
in
its
denunciation
of
me
because
of
what
it
alleged
to
be
my
unfriendly
attitude
toward
labor
to
one
of
my
critics
i
set
forth
my
views
in
the
following
letter
november
i
have
your
letter
of
the
instant
with
enclosure
these
men
not
all
of
whom
were
miners
by
the
way
came
here
and
were
at
lunch
with
me
in
company
with
carroll
wright
wayne
macveagh
and
secretary
cortelyou
they
are
as
decent
a
set
of
men
as
can
be
they
all
agreed
entirely
with
me
in
my
denunciation
of
what
had
been
done
in
the
court
country
and
it
appeared
that
some
of
them
were
on
the
platform
with
me
when
i
denounced
this
type
of
outrage
three
years
ago
in
butte
there
is
not
one
man
who
was
here
who
i
believe
was
in
any
way
shape
or
form
responsible
for
such
outrages
i
find
that
the
members
of
the
unions
in
butte
denounced
these
men
for
coming
here
in
a
manner
as
violent
and
i
may
say
as
irrational
as
the
denunciation
by
the
capitalistic
writer
in
the
article
you
sent
me
doubtless
the
gentleman
of
whom
you
speak
as
your
general
manager
is
an
admirable
man
i
of
course
was
not
alluding
to
him
but
i
most
emphatically
alluding
to
men
who
write
such
articles
as
that
you
sent
me
these
articles
are
to
be
paralleled
by
the
similar
articles
in
the
populist
and
socialist
papers
when
two
years
ago
i
had
at
dinner
at
one
time
pierpont
morgan
and
at
another
time
hill
and
at
another
harriman
and
at
another
time
schiff
furthermore
they
could
be
paralleled
by
the
articles
in
the
same
type
of
paper
which
at
the
time
of
the
miller
incident
in
the
printing
office
were
in
a
condition
of
nervous
anxiety
because
i
met
the
labor
leaders
to
discuss
it
it
would
have
been
a
great
misfortune
if
i
had
not
met
them
and
it
would
have
been
an
even
greater
misfortune
if
after
meeting
them
i
had
yielded
to
their
protests
in
the
matter
you
say
in
your
letter
that
you
know
that
i
am
record
as
opposed
to
violence
pardon
my
saying
that
this
seems
to
me
not
the
right
way
to
put
the
matter
if
by
you
mean
utterance
and
not
action
aside
from
what
happened
when
i
was
governor
in
connection
for
instance
with
the
croton
dam
strike
riots
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
turn
back
to
what
took
place
last
june
in
arizona
and
you
can
find
out
about
it
from
x
of
new
york
the
miners
struck
violence
followed
and
the
arizona
territorial
authorities
notified
me
they
could
not
grapple
with
the
situation
within
twenty
minutes
of
the
receipt
of
the
telegram
orders
were
issued
to
the
nearest
available
troops
and
hours
afterwards
general
baldwin
and
his
regulars
were
on
the
ground
and
hours
later
every
vestige
of
disorder
had
disappeared
the
miners
federation
in
their
meeting
i
think
at
denver
a
short
while
afterwards
passed
resolutions
denouncing
me
i
do
not
know
whether
the
and
engineering
paid
any
heed
to
this
incident
or
know
of
it
if
the
did
i
suppose
it
can
hardly
have
failed
to
understand
that
to
put
an
immediate
stop
to
rioting
by
the
use
of
the
united
states
army
is
a
fact
of
importance
beside
which
the
criticism
of
my
having
leaders
to
lunch
shrinks
into
the
same
insignificance
as
the
criticism
in
a
different
type
of
paper
about
my
having
magnates
to
lunch
while
i
am
president
i
wish
the
labor
man
to
feel
that
he
has
the
same
right
of
access
to
me
that
the
capitalist
has
that
the
doors
swing
open
as
easily
to
the
as
to
the
head
of
a
big
corporation
no
anything
else
seems
to
be
not
only
but
as
symptomatic
of
an
attitude
which
will
cost
grave
trouble
if
persevered
in
to
discriminate
against
labor
men
from
butte
because
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
rioting
has
been
excited
in
other
districts
by
certain
labor
unions
or
individuals
in
labor
unions
in
butte
would
be
to
adopt
precisely
the
attitude
of
those
who
desire
me
to
discriminate
against
all
capitalists
in
wall
street
because
there
are
plenty
of
capitalists
in
wall
street
who
have
been
guilty
of
bad
financial
practices
and
who
have
endeavored
to
override
or
evade
the
laws
of
the
land
in
my
judgment
the
only
safe
attitude
for
a
private
citizen
and
still
more
for
a
public
servant
to
assume
is
that
he
will
draw
the
line
on
conduct
discriminating
against
neither
corporation
nor
union
as
such
nor
in
favor
of
either
as
such
but
endeavoring
to
make
the
decent
member
of
the
union
and
the
upright
capitalists
alike
feel
that
they
are
bound
not
only
by
but
by
every
consideration
of
principle
and
duty
to
stand
together
on
the
matters
of
most
moment
to
the
nation
on
another
of
the
various
occasions
when
i
had
labor
leaders
to
dine
at
the
white
house
my
critics
were
rather
shocked
because
i
had
john
morley
to
meet
them
the
labor
leaders
in
question
included
the
heads
of
the
various
railroad
brotherhoods
men
like
morrissey
in
whose
sound
judgment
and
high
standard
of
citizenship
i
had
peculiar
confidence
and
i
asked
morley
to
meet
them
because
they
represented
the
exact
type
of
american
citizen
with
whom
i
thought
he
ought
to
be
brought
in
contact
one
of
the
devices
sometimes
used
by
big
corporations
to
break
down
the
law
was
to
treat
the
passage
of
laws
as
an
excuse
for
action
on
their
part
which
they
knew
would
be
resented
by
the
public
it
being
their
purpose
to
turn
this
resentment
against
the
law
instead
of
against
themselves
the
heads
of
the
louisville
and
nashville
road
were
bitter
opponents
of
everything
done
by
the
government
toward
securing
good
treatment
for
their
employees
in
february
they
and
various
other
railways
announced
that
they
intended
to
reduce
the
wages
of
their
employees
a
general
strike
with
all
the
attendant
disorder
and
trouble
was
threatened
in
consequence
i
accordingly
sent
the
following
open
letter
to
the
commerce
commission
february
to
the
commerce
commission
i
am
informed
that
a
number
of
railroad
companies
have
served
notice
of
a
proposed
reduction
of
wages
of
their
employees
one
of
them
the
louisville
and
nashville
in
announcing
the
reduction
states
that
drastic
laws
inimical
to
the
interests
of
the
railroads
that
have
in
the
past
year
or
two
been
enacted
by
congress
and
the
state
are
largely
or
chiefly
responsible
for
the
conditions
requiring
the
reduction
under
such
circumstances
it
is
possible
that
the
public
may
soon
be
confronted
by
serious
industrial
disputes
and
the
law
provides
that
in
such
case
either
party
may
demand
the
services
of
your
chairman
and
of
the
commissioner
of
labor
as
a
board
of
mediation
and
conciliation
these
reductions
in
wages
may
be
warranted
or
they
may
not
as
to
this
the
public
which
is
a
vitally
interested
party
can
form
no
judgment
without
a
more
complete
knowledge
of
the
essential
facts
and
real
merits
of
the
case
than
it
now
has
or
than
it
can
possibly
obtain
from
the
special
pleadings
certain
to
be
put
forth
by
each
side
in
case
their
dispute
should
bring
about
serious
interruption
to
traffic
if
the
reduction
in
wages
is
due
to
natural
causes
the
loss
of
business
being
such
that
the
burden
should
be
and
is
equitably
distributed
between
capitalist
and
the
public
should
know
it
if
it
is
caused
by
legislation
the
public
and
congress
should
know
it
and
if
it
is
caused
by
misconduct
in
the
past
financial
or
other
operations
of
any
railroad
then
everybody
should
know
it
especially
if
the
excuse
of
unfriendly
legislation
is
advanced
as
a
method
of
covering
up
past
business
misconduct
by
the
railroad
managers
or
as
a
justification
for
failure
to
treat
fairly
the
employees
of
the
company
moreover
an
industrial
conflict
between
a
railroad
corporation
and
its
employees
offers
peculiar
opportunities
to
any
small
number
of
persons
to
destroy
life
and
property
and
foment
public
disorder
of
course
if
life
property
and
public
order
are
endangered
prompt
and
drastic
measures
for
their
protection
become
the
first
plain
duty
all
other
issues
then
become
subordinate
to
the
preservation
of
the
public
peace
and
the
real
merits
of
the
original
controversy
are
necessarily
lost
from
view
this
vital
consideration
should
be
ever
kept
in
mind
by
all
and
members
of
labor
organizations
it
is
sincerely
to
be
hoped
therefore
that
any
wage
controversy
that
may
arise
between
the
railroads
and
their
employees
may
find
a
peaceful
solution
through
the
methods
of
conciliation
and
arbitration
already
provided
by
congress
which
have
proven
so
effective
during
the
past
year
to
this
end
the
commission
should
be
in
a
position
to
have
available
for
any
board
of
conciliation
or
arbitration
relevant
data
pertaining
to
such
carriers
as
may
become
involved
in
industrial
disputes
should
conciliation
fail
to
effect
a
settlement
and
arbitration
be
rejected
accurate
information
should
be
available
in
order
to
develop
a
properly
informed
public
opinion
i
therefore
ask
you
to
make
such
investigation
both
of
your
records
and
by
any
other
means
at
your
command
as
will
enable
you
to
furnish
data
concerning
such
conditions
obtaining
on
the
louisville
and
nashville
and
any
other
roads
as
may
relate
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
real
merits
of
the
possibly
impending
controversy
theodore
roosevelt
this
letter
achieved
its
purpose
and
the
threatened
reduction
of
wages
was
not
made
it
was
an
instance
of
what
could
be
accomplished
by
governmental
action
let
me
add
however
with
all
the
emphasis
i
possess
that
this
does
not
mean
any
failure
on
my
part
to
recognize
the
fact
that
if
governmental
action
places
too
heavy
burdens
on
railways
it
will
be
impossible
for
them
to
operate
without
doing
injustice
to
somebody
railways
can
not
pay
proper
wages
and
render
proper
service
unless
they
make
money
the
investors
must
get
a
reasonable
profit
or
they
will
not
invest
and
the
public
can
not
be
well
served
unless
the
investors
are
making
reasonable
profits
there
is
every
reason
why
rates
should
not
be
too
high
but
they
must
be
sufficiently
high
to
allow
the
railways
to
pay
good
wages
moreover
when
laws
like
compensation
laws
and
the
like
are
passed
it
must
always
be
kept
in
mind
by
the
legislature
that
the
purpose
is
to
distribute
over
the
whole
community
a
burden
that
should
not
be
borne
only
by
those
least
able
to
bear
it
that
is
by
the
injured
man
or
the
widow
and
orphans
of
the
dead
man
if
the
railway
is
already
receiving
a
disproportionate
return
from
the
public
then
the
burden
may
with
propriety
bear
purely
on
the
railway
but
if
it
is
not
earning
a
disproportionate
return
then
the
public
must
bear
its
share
of
the
burden
of
the
increased
service
the
railway
is
rendering
dividends
and
wages
should
go
up
together
and
the
relation
of
rates
to
them
should
never
be
forgotten
this
of
course
does
not
apply
to
dividends
based
on
water
nor
does
it
mean
that
if
foolish
people
have
built
a
road
that
renders
no
service
the
public
must
nevertheless
in
some
way
guarantee
a
return
on
the
investment
but
it
does
mean
that
the
interests
of
the
honest
investor
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection
as
the
interests
of
the
honest
manager
the
honest
shipper
and
the
honest
all
these
conflicting
considerations
should
be
carefully
considered
by
legislatures
before
passing
laws
one
of
the
great
objects
in
creating
commissions
should
be
the
provision
of
disinterested
experts
who
will
really
and
wisely
consider
all
these
matters
and
will
shape
their
actions
accordingly
this
is
one
reason
why
such
matters
as
the
regulation
of
rates
the
provision
for
full
crews
on
roads
and
the
like
should
be
left
for
treatment
by
railway
commissions
and
not
be
settled
off
hand
by
direct
legislative
action
appendix
socialism
as
regards
what
i
have
said
in
this
chapter
concerning
socialism
i
wish
to
call
especial
attention
to
the
admirable
book
on
marxism
versus
socialism
which
has
just
been
published
by
vladimir
simkhovitch
what
i
have
here
and
elsewhere
merely
pointed
out
in
rough
and
ready
fashion
from
actual
observation
of
the
facts
of
life
around
me
professor
simkhovitch
in
his
book
has
discussed
with
keen
practical
insight
with
profundity
of
learning
and
with
a
wealth
of
applied
philosophy
crude
thinkers
in
the
united
states
and
moreover
honest
and
intelligent
men
who
are
not
crude
thinkers
but
who
are
oppressed
by
the
sight
of
the
misery
around
them
and
have
not
deeply
studied
what
has
been
done
elsewhere
are
very
apt
to
adopt
as
their
own
the
theories
of
european
marxian
socialists
of
half
a
century
ago
ignorant
that
the
course
of
events
has
so
completely
falsified
the
prophecies
contained
in
these
theories
that
they
have
been
abandoned
even
by
the
authors
themselves
with
quiet
humor
professor
simkhovitch
now
and
then
makes
an
allusion
which
shows
that
he
appreciates
to
perfection
this
rather
curious
quality
of
some
of
our
fellow
countrymen
as
for
example
when
he
says
that
a
socialist
state
with
the
farmer
outside
of
it
is
a
conception
that
can
rest
comfortably
only
in
the
head
of
an
american
socialist
or
as
when
he
speaks
of
marx
and
engels
as
men
to
whom
thinking
was
not
an
irrelevant
foreign
tradition
too
many
thoroughly
men
and
women
in
the
america
of
glibly
repeat
and
accept
much
as
medieval
schoolmen
repeated
and
accepted
authorized
dogma
in
their
day
various
assumptions
and
speculations
by
marx
and
others
which
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
by
actual
experiment
have
been
shown
to
possess
not
one
shred
of
value
professor
simkhovitch
possesses
the
gift
of
condensation
as
well
as
the
gift
of
clear
and
logical
statement
and
it
is
not
possible
to
give
in
brief
any
idea
of
his
admirable
work
every
social
reformer
who
desires
to
face
facts
should
study
it
just
as
social
reformers
should
study
john
graham
american
syndicalism
from
professor
simkhovitch
book
we
americans
should
learn
first
to
discard
crude
thinking
second
to
realize
that
the
orthodox
or
scientific
or
purely
economic
or
materialistic
socialism
of
the
type
preached
by
marx
is
an
exploded
theory
and
third
that
many
of
the
men
who
call
themselves
socialists
are
in
reality
merely
radical
social
reformers
with
whom
on
many
points
good
citizens
can
and
ought
to
work
in
hearty
general
agreement
and
whom
in
many
practical
matters
of
government
good
citizens
well
afford
to
follow
chapter
xiv
the
monroe
doctrine
and
the
panama
canal
no
nation
can
claim
rights
without
acknowledging
the
duties
that
go
with
the
rights
it
is
a
contemptible
thing
for
a
great
nation
to
render
itself
impotent
in
international
action
whether
because
of
cowardice
or
sloth
or
sheer
inability
or
unwillingness
to
look
into
the
future
it
is
a
very
wicked
thing
for
a
nation
to
do
wrong
to
others
but
the
most
contemptible
and
most
wicked
course
of
conduct
is
for
a
nation
to
use
offensive
language
or
be
guilty
of
offensive
actions
toward
other
people
and
yet
fail
to
hold
its
own
if
the
other
nation
retaliates
and
it
is
almost
as
bad
to
undertake
responsibilities
and
then
not
fulfil
them
during
the
seven
and
a
half
years
that
i
was
president
this
nation
behaved
in
international
matters
toward
all
other
nations
precisely
as
an
honorable
man
behaves
to
his
we
made
no
promise
which
we
could
not
and
did
not
keep
we
made
no
threat
which
we
did
not
carry
out
we
never
failed
to
assert
our
rights
in
the
face
of
the
strong
and
we
never
failed
to
treat
both
strong
and
weak
with
courtesy
and
justice
and
against
the
weak
when
they
misbehaved
we
were
slower
to
assert
our
rights
than
we
were
against
the
strong
as
a
legacy
of
the
spanish
war
we
were
left
with
peculiar
relations
to
the
philippines
cuba
and
porto
rico
and
with
an
immensely
added
interest
in
central
america
and
the
caribbean
sea
as
regards
the
philippines
my
belief
was
that
we
should
train
them
for
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
then
leave
them
free
to
decide
their
own
fate
i
did
not
believe
in
setting
the
within
which
we
would
give
them
independence
because
i
did
not
believe
it
wise
to
try
to
forecast
how
soon
they
would
be
fit
for
and
once
having
made
the
promise
i
would
have
felt
that
it
was
imperative
to
keep
it
within
a
few
months
of
my
assuming
office
we
had
stamped
out
the
last
armed
resistance
in
the
philippines
that
was
not
of
merely
sporadic
character
and
as
soon
as
peace
was
secured
we
turned
our
energies
to
developing
the
islands
in
the
interests
of
the
natives
we
established
schools
everywhere
we
built
roads
we
administered
an
justice
we
did
everything
possible
to
encourage
agriculture
and
industry
and
in
constantly
increasing
measure
we
employed
natives
to
do
their
own
governing
and
finally
provided
a
legislative
chamber
no
higher
grade
of
public
officials
ever
handled
the
affairs
of
any
colony
than
the
public
officials
who
in
succession
governed
the
philippines
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
sudan
and
not
even
excepting
algiers
i
know
of
no
country
ruled
and
administered
by
men
of
the
white
race
where
that
rule
and
that
administration
have
been
exercised
so
emphatically
with
an
eye
single
to
the
welfare
of
the
natives
themselves
the
english
and
dutch
administrators
of
malaysia
have
done
admirable
work
but
the
profit
to
the
europeans
in
those
states
has
always
been
one
of
the
chief
elements
considered
whereas
in
the
philippines
our
whole
attention
was
concentrated
upon
the
welfare
of
the
filipinos
themselves
if
anything
to
the
neglect
of
our
own
interests
i
do
not
believe
that
america
has
any
special
beneficial
interest
in
retaining
the
philippines
our
work
there
has
benefited
us
only
as
any
efficiently
done
work
performed
for
the
benefit
of
others
does
incidentally
help
the
character
of
those
who
do
it
the
people
of
the
islands
have
never
developed
so
rapidly
from
every
standpoint
as
during
the
years
of
the
american
occupation
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
wise
to
take
their
own
judgment
as
to
whether
they
wish
to
continue
their
association
with
america
or
not
there
is
however
one
consideration
upon
which
we
should
insist
either
we
should
retain
complete
control
of
the
islands
or
absolve
ourselves
from
all
responsibility
for
them
any
half
and
half
course
would
be
both
foolish
and
disastrous
we
are
governing
and
have
been
governing
the
islands
in
the
interests
of
the
filipinos
themselves
if
after
due
time
the
filipinos
themselves
decide
that
they
do
not
wish
to
be
thus
governed
then
i
trust
that
we
will
leave
but
when
we
do
leave
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
retain
no
protectorate
and
above
all
that
we
take
part
in
no
joint
protectorate
over
the
islands
and
give
them
no
guarantee
of
neutrality
or
otherwise
that
in
short
we
are
absolutely
quit
of
responsibility
for
them
of
every
kind
and
description
the
filipinos
were
quite
incapable
of
standing
by
themselves
when
we
took
possession
of
the
islands
and
we
had
made
no
promise
concerning
them
but
we
had
explicitly
promised
to
leave
the
island
of
cuba
had
explicitly
promised
that
cuba
should
be
independent
early
in
my
administration
that
promise
was
redeemed
when
the
promise
was
made
i
doubt
if
there
was
a
single
ruler
or
diplomat
in
europe
who
believed
that
it
would
be
kept
as
far
as
i
know
the
united
states
was
the
first
power
which
having
made
such
a
promise
kept
it
in
letter
and
spirit
england
was
unwise
enough
to
make
such
a
promise
when
she
took
egypt
it
would
have
been
a
capital
misfortune
to
have
kept
the
promise
and
england
has
remained
in
egypt
for
over
thirty
years
and
will
unquestionably
remain
indefinitely
but
though
it
is
necessary
for
her
to
do
so
the
fact
of
her
doing
so
has
meant
the
breaking
of
a
positive
promise
and
has
been
a
real
evil
japan
made
the
same
guarantee
about
korea
but
as
far
as
can
be
seen
there
was
never
even
any
thought
of
keeping
the
promise
in
this
case
and
korea
which
had
shown
herself
utterly
impotent
either
for
or
was
in
actual
fact
almost
immediately
annexed
to
japan
we
made
the
promise
to
give
cuba
independence
and
we
kept
the
promise
leonard
wood
was
left
in
as
governor
for
two
or
three
years
and
evolved
order
out
of
chaos
raising
the
administration
of
the
island
to
a
level
moral
and
material
which
it
had
never
before
achieved
we
also
by
treaty
gave
the
cubans
substantial
advantages
in
our
markets
then
we
left
the
island
turning
the
government
over
to
its
own
people
after
four
or
five
years
a
revolution
broke
out
during
my
administration
and
we
again
had
to
intervene
to
restore
order
we
promptly
sent
thither
a
small
army
of
pacification
under
general
barry
order
was
restored
and
kept
and
absolute
justice
done
the
american
troops
were
then
withdrawn
and
the
cubans
reestablished
in
complete
possession
of
their
own
beautiful
island
and
they
are
in
possession
of
it
now
there
are
plenty
of
occasions
in
our
history
when
we
have
shown
weakness
or
inefficiency
and
some
occasions
when
we
have
not
been
as
scrupulous
as
we
should
have
been
as
regards
the
rights
of
others
but
i
know
of
no
action
by
any
other
government
in
relation
to
a
weaker
power
which
showed
such
disinterested
efficiency
in
rendering
service
as
was
true
in
connection
with
our
intervention
in
cuba
in
cuba
as
in
the
philippines
and
as
in
porto
rico
santo
domingo
and
later
in
panama
no
small
part
of
our
success
was
due
to
the
fact
that
we
put
in
the
highest
grade
of
men
as
public
officials
this
practice
was
inaugurated
under
president
mckinley
i
found
admirable
men
in
office
and
i
continued
them
and
appointed
men
like
them
as
their
successors
the
way
that
the
in
santo
domingo
were
administered
by
colton
definitely
established
the
success
of
our
experiment
in
securing
peace
for
that
island
republic
and
in
porto
rico
under
the
administration
of
affairs
under
such
officials
as
hunt
winthrop
post
ward
and
grahame
more
substantial
progress
was
achieved
in
a
decade
than
in
any
previous
century
the
philippines
cuba
and
porto
rico
came
within
our
own
sphere
of
governmental
action
in
addition
to
this
we
asserted
certain
rights
in
the
western
hemisphere
under
the
monroe
doctrine
my
endeavor
was
not
only
to
assert
these
rights
but
frankly
and
fully
to
acknowledge
the
duties
that
went
with
the
rights
the
monroe
doctrine
lays
down
the
rule
that
the
western
hemisphere
is
not
hereafter
to
be
treated
as
subject
to
settlement
and
occupation
by
old
world
powers
it
is
not
international
law
but
it
is
a
cardinal
principle
of
our
foreign
policy
there
is
no
difficulty
at
the
present
day
in
maintaining
this
doctrine
save
where
the
american
power
whose
interest
is
threatened
has
shown
itself
in
international
matters
both
weak
and
delinquent
the
great
and
prosperous
civilized
commonwealths
such
as
the
argentine
brazil
and
chile
in
the
southern
half
of
south
america
have
advanced
so
far
that
they
no
longer
stand
in
any
position
of
tutelage
toward
the
united
states
they
occupy
toward
us
precisely
the
position
that
canada
occupies
their
friendship
is
the
friendship
of
equals
for
equals
my
view
was
that
as
regards
these
nations
there
was
no
more
necessity
for
asserting
the
monroe
doctrine
than
there
was
to
assert
it
in
regard
to
canada
they
were
competent
to
assert
it
for
themselves
of
course
if
one
of
these
nations
or
if
canada
should
be
overcome
by
some
old
world
power
which
then
proceeded
to
occupy
its
territory
we
would
undoubtedly
if
the
american
nation
needed
our
help
give
it
in
order
to
prevent
such
occupation
from
taking
place
but
the
initiative
would
come
from
the
nation
itself
and
the
united
states
would
merely
act
as
a
friend
whose
help
was
invoked
the
case
was
and
is
widely
different
as
regards
certain
not
all
of
the
tropical
states
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
caribbean
sea
where
these
states
are
stable
and
prosperous
they
stand
on
a
footing
of
absolute
equality
with
all
other
communities
but
some
of
them
have
been
a
prey
to
such
continuous
revolutionary
misrule
as
to
have
grown
impotent
either
to
do
their
duties
to
outsiders
or
to
enforce
their
rights
against
outsiders
the
united
states
has
not
the
slightest
desire
to
make
aggressions
on
any
one
of
these
states
on
the
contrary
it
will
submit
to
much
from
them
without
showing
resentment
if
any
great
civilized
power
russia
or
germany
for
instance
had
behaved
toward
us
as
venezuela
under
castro
behaved
this
country
would
have
gone
to
war
at
once
we
did
not
go
to
war
with
venezuela
merely
because
our
people
declined
to
be
irritated
by
the
actions
of
a
weak
opponent
and
showed
a
forbearance
which
probably
went
beyond
the
limits
of
wisdom
in
refusing
to
take
umbrage
at
what
was
done
by
the
weak
although
we
would
certainly
have
resented
it
had
it
been
done
by
the
strong
in
the
case
of
two
states
however
affairs
reached
such
a
crisis
that
we
had
to
act
these
two
states
were
santo
domingo
and
the
then
owner
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
colombia
the
santo
domingan
case
was
the
less
important
and
yet
it
possessed
a
real
importance
and
moreover
is
instructive
because
the
action
there
taken
should
serve
as
a
precedent
for
american
action
in
all
similar
cases
during
the
early
years
of
my
administration
santo
domingo
was
in
its
usual
condition
of
chronic
revolution
there
was
always
fighting
always
plundering
and
the
successful
graspers
for
governmental
power
were
always
pawning
ports
and
or
trying
to
put
them
up
as
guarantees
for
loans
of
course
the
foreigners
who
made
loans
under
such
conditions
demanded
exorbitant
interest
and
if
they
were
europeans
expected
their
governments
to
stand
by
them
so
utter
was
the
disorder
that
on
one
occasion
when
admiral
dewey
landed
to
pay
a
call
of
ceremony
on
the
president
he
and
his
party
were
shot
at
by
revolutionists
in
crossing
the
square
and
had
to
return
to
the
ships
leaving
the
call
unpaid
there
was
default
on
the
interest
due
to
the
creditors
and
finally
the
latter
insisted
upon
their
governments
intervening
two
or
three
of
the
european
powers
were
endeavoring
to
arrange
for
concerted
action
and
i
was
finally
notified
that
these
powers
intended
to
take
and
hold
several
of
the
seaports
which
held
this
meant
that
unless
i
acted
at
once
i
would
find
foreign
powers
in
partial
possession
of
santo
domingo
in
which
event
the
very
individuals
who
in
the
actual
event
deprecated
the
precaution
taken
to
prevent
such
action
would
have
advocated
extreme
and
violent
measures
to
undo
the
effect
of
their
own
supineness
of
wisdom
is
to
be
wise
in
time
and
at
the
right
time
and
my
whole
foreign
policy
was
based
on
the
exercise
of
intelligent
forethought
and
of
decisive
action
sufficiently
far
in
advance
of
any
likely
crisis
to
make
it
improbable
that
we
would
run
into
serious
trouble
santo
domingo
had
fallen
into
such
chaos
that
once
for
some
weeks
there
were
two
rival
governments
in
it
and
a
revolution
was
being
carried
on
against
each
at
one
period
one
government
was
at
sea
in
a
small
gunboat
but
still
stoutly
maintained
that
it
was
in
possession
of
the
island
and
entitled
to
make
loans
and
declare
peace
or
war
the
situation
had
become
intolerable
by
the
time
that
i
interfered
there
was
a
naval
commander
in
the
waters
whom
i
directed
to
prevent
any
fighting
which
might
menace
the
he
carried
out
his
orders
both
to
his
and
my
satisfaction
in
thoroughgoing
fashion
on
one
occasion
when
an
insurgent
force
threatened
to
attack
a
town
in
which
americans
had
interests
he
notified
the
commanders
on
both
sides
that
he
would
not
permit
any
fighting
in
the
town
but
that
he
would
appoint
a
certain
place
where
they
could
meet
and
fight
it
out
and
that
the
victors
should
have
the
town
they
agreed
to
meet
his
wishes
the
fight
came
off
at
the
appointed
place
and
the
victors
who
if
i
remember
rightly
were
the
insurgents
were
given
the
town
it
was
the
that
caused
the
trouble
for
they
offered
the
only
means
of
raising
money
and
the
revolutions
were
carried
on
to
get
possession
of
them
accordingly
i
secured
an
agreement
with
the
governmental
authorities
who
for
the
moment
seemed
best
able
to
speak
for
the
country
by
which
these
were
placed
under
american
control
the
arrangement
was
that
we
should
keep
order
and
prevent
any
interference
with
the
or
the
places
where
they
stood
and
should
collect
the
revenues
per
cent
of
the
revenue
was
then
turned
over
to
the
santo
domingan
government
and
per
cent
put
in
a
sinking
fund
in
new
york
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors
the
arrangement
worked
in
capital
style
on
the
per
cent
basis
the
santo
domingan
government
received
from
us
a
larger
sum
than
it
had
ever
received
before
when
nominally
all
the
revenue
went
to
it
the
creditors
were
entirely
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
and
no
excuse
for
interference
by
european
powers
remained
occasional
disturbances
occurred
in
the
island
of
course
but
on
the
whole
there
ensued
a
degree
of
peace
and
prosperity
which
the
island
had
not
known
before
for
at
least
a
century
all
this
was
done
without
the
loss
of
a
life
with
the
assent
of
all
the
parties
in
interest
and
without
subjecting
the
united
states
to
any
charge
while
practically
all
of
the
interference
after
the
naval
commander
whom
i
have
mentioned
had
taken
the
initial
steps
in
preserving
order
consisted
in
putting
a
man
trained
in
our
insular
service
at
the
head
of
the
santo
domingan
customs
service
we
secured
peace
we
protected
the
people
of
the
islands
against
foreign
foes
and
we
minimized
the
chance
of
domestic
trouble
we
satisfied
the
creditors
and
the
foreign
nations
to
which
the
creditors
belonged
and
our
own
part
of
the
work
was
done
with
the
utmost
efficiency
and
with
rigid
honesty
so
that
not
a
particle
of
scandal
was
ever
so
much
as
hinted
at
under
these
circumstances
those
who
do
not
know
the
nature
of
the
professional
international
philanthropists
would
suppose
that
these
apostles
of
international
peace
would
have
been
overjoyed
with
what
we
had
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
they
took
any
notice
of
it
at
all
it
was
to
denounce
it
and
those
american
newspapers
which
are
fondest
of
proclaiming
themselves
the
foes
of
war
and
the
friends
of
peace
violently
attacked
me
for
averting
war
from
and
bringing
peace
to
the
island
they
insisted
i
had
no
power
to
make
the
agreement
and
demanded
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
which
was
to
perpetuate
the
agreement
they
were
of
course
wholly
unable
to
advance
a
single
sound
reason
of
any
kind
for
their
attitude
i
suppose
the
real
explanation
was
partly
their
dislike
of
me
personally
and
unwillingness
to
see
peace
come
through
or
national
honor
upheld
by
me
and
in
the
next
place
their
sheer
simple
devotion
to
prattle
and
dislike
of
efficiency
they
liked
to
have
people
come
together
and
talk
about
peace
or
even
sign
bits
of
paper
with
something
about
peace
or
arbitration
on
them
but
they
took
no
interest
whatever
in
the
practical
achievement
of
a
peace
that
told
for
good
government
and
decency
and
honesty
they
were
joined
by
the
many
moderately
men
who
always
demand
that
a
thing
be
done
but
also
always
demand
that
it
be
not
done
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
possible
to
do
it
the
men
of
this
kind
insisted
that
of
course
santo
domingo
must
be
protected
and
made
to
behave
itself
and
that
of
course
the
panama
canal
must
be
dug
but
they
insisted
even
more
strongly
that
neither
feat
should
be
accomplished
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
was
possible
to
accomplish
it
at
all
the
constitution
did
not
explicitly
give
me
power
to
bring
about
the
necessary
agreement
with
santo
domingo
but
the
constitution
did
not
forbid
my
doing
what
i
did
i
put
the
agreement
into
effect
and
i
continued
its
execution
for
two
years
before
the
senate
acted
and
i
would
have
continued
it
until
the
end
of
my
term
if
necessary
without
any
action
by
congress
but
it
was
far
preferable
that
there
should
be
action
by
congress
so
that
we
might
be
proceeding
under
a
treaty
which
was
the
law
of
the
land
and
not
merely
by
a
direction
of
the
chief
executive
which
would
lapse
when
that
particular
executive
left
office
i
therefore
did
my
best
to
get
the
senate
to
ratify
what
i
had
done
there
was
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
about
it
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
men
like
clark
of
arkansas
the
democratic
senators
acted
in
that
spirit
of
unworthy
partisanship
which
subordinates
national
interest
to
some
fancied
partisan
advantage
and
they
were
cordially
backed
by
all
that
portion
of
the
press
which
took
its
inspiration
from
wall
street
and
was
violently
hostile
to
the
administration
because
of
its
attitude
towards
great
corporations
most
of
the
republican
senators
under
the
lead
of
senator
lodge
stood
by
me
but
some
of
them
of
the
more
conservative
or
reactionary
type
who
were
already
growing
hostile
to
me
on
the
trust
question
first
proceeded
to
sneer
at
what
had
been
done
and
to
raise
all
kinds
of
meticulous
objections
which
they
themselves
finally
abandoned
but
which
furnished
an
excuse
on
which
the
opponents
of
the
treaty
could
hang
adverse
action
unfortunately
the
senators
who
were
most
apt
to
speak
of
the
dignity
of
the
senate
and
to
insist
upon
its
importance
were
the
very
ones
who
were
also
most
apt
to
try
to
make
display
of
this
dignity
and
importance
by
thwarting
the
public
business
this
case
was
typical
the
republicans
in
question
spoke
against
certain
provisions
of
the
proposed
treaty
they
then
having
ingeniously
provided
ammunition
for
the
foes
of
the
treaty
abandoned
their
opposition
to
it
and
the
democrats
stepped
into
the
position
they
had
abandoned
enough
republicans
were
absent
to
prevent
the
securing
of
a
vote
for
the
treaty
and
the
senate
adjourned
without
any
action
at
all
and
with
a
feeling
of
entire
at
having
left
the
country
in
the
position
of
assuming
a
responsibility
and
then
failing
to
fulfil
it
apparently
the
senators
in
question
felt
that
in
some
way
they
had
upheld
their
dignity
all
that
they
had
really
done
was
to
shirk
their
duty
somebody
had
to
do
that
duty
and
accordingly
i
did
it
i
went
ahead
and
administered
the
proposed
treaty
anyhow
considering
it
as
a
simple
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
executive
which
would
be
converted
into
a
treaty
whenever
the
senate
acted
after
a
couple
of
years
the
senate
did
act
having
previously
made
some
utterly
unimportant
changes
which
i
ratified
and
persuaded
santo
domingo
to
ratify
in
all
its
history
santo
domingo
has
had
nothing
happen
to
it
as
fortunate
as
this
treaty
and
the
passing
of
it
saved
the
united
states
from
having
to
face
serious
difficulties
with
one
or
more
foreign
powers
it
can
not
in
the
long
run
prove
possible
for
the
united
states
to
protect
delinquent
american
nations
from
punishment
for
the
of
their
duties
unless
she
undertakes
to
make
them
perform
their
duties
people
may
theorize
about
this
as
much
as
they
wish
but
whenever
a
sufficiently
strong
outside
nation
becomes
sufficiently
aggrieved
then
either
that
nation
will
act
or
the
united
states
government
itself
will
have
to
act
we
were
face
to
face
at
one
period
of
my
administration
with
this
condition
of
affairs
in
venezuela
when
germany
rather
feebly
backed
by
england
undertook
a
blockade
against
venezuela
to
make
venezuela
adopt
the
german
and
english
view
about
certain
agreements
there
was
real
danger
that
the
blockade
would
finally
result
in
germany
taking
possession
of
certain
cities
or
i
succeeded
however
in
getting
all
the
parties
in
interest
to
submit
their
cases
to
the
hague
tribunal
by
far
the
most
important
action
i
took
in
foreign
affairs
during
the
time
i
was
president
related
to
the
panama
canal
here
again
there
was
much
accusation
about
my
having
acted
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
a
position
which
can
be
upheld
only
if
jefferson
action
in
acquiring
louisiana
be
also
treated
as
unconstitutional
and
at
different
stages
of
the
affair
believers
in
a
policy
denounced
me
as
having
usurped
authority
which
meant
that
when
nobody
else
could
or
would
exercise
efficient
authority
i
exercised
it
during
the
nearly
four
hundred
years
that
had
elapsed
since
balboa
crossed
the
isthmus
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
building
an
isthmus
canal
and
there
had
been
various
discussions
of
the
subject
and
negotiations
about
it
in
washington
for
the
previous
half
century
so
far
it
had
all
resulted
merely
in
conversation
and
the
time
had
come
when
unless
somebody
was
prepared
to
act
with
decision
we
would
have
to
resign
ourselves
to
at
least
half
a
century
of
further
conversation
under
the
treaty
signed
shortly
after
i
became
president
and
thanks
to
our
negotiations
with
the
french
panama
company
the
united
states
at
last
acquired
a
possession
so
far
as
europe
was
concerned
which
warranted
her
in
immediately
undertaking
the
task
it
remained
to
decide
where
the
canal
should
be
whether
along
the
line
already
pioneered
by
the
french
company
in
panama
or
in
nicaragua
panama
belonged
to
the
republic
of
colombia
nicaragua
bid
eagerly
for
the
privilege
of
having
the
united
states
build
the
canal
through
her
territory
as
long
as
it
was
doubtful
which
route
we
would
decide
upon
colombia
extended
every
promise
of
friendly
cooperation
at
the
congress
in
mexico
her
delegate
joined
in
the
unanimous
vote
which
requested
the
united
states
forthwith
to
build
the
canal
and
at
her
eager
request
we
negotiated
the
treaty
with
her
which
gave
us
the
right
to
build
the
canal
across
panama
a
board
of
experts
sent
to
the
isthmus
had
reported
that
this
route
was
better
than
the
nicaragua
route
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
build
the
canal
over
it
provided
we
could
purchase
the
rights
of
the
french
company
for
forty
million
dollars
but
that
otherwise
they
would
advise
taking
the
nicaragua
route
ever
since
we
had
had
a
treaty
with
the
power
then
in
control
of
the
isthmus
the
republic
of
new
granada
the
predecessor
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
of
the
present
republic
of
panama
by
which
treaty
the
united
states
was
guaranteed
free
and
open
right
of
way
across
the
isthmus
of
panama
by
any
mode
of
communication
that
might
be
constructed
while
in
return
our
government
guaranteed
the
perfect
neutrality
of
the
isthmus
with
a
view
to
the
preservation
of
free
transit
for
nearly
fifty
years
we
had
asserted
the
right
to
prevent
the
closing
of
this
highway
of
commerce
secretary
of
state
cass
in
officially
stated
the
american
position
as
follows
sovereignty
has
its
duties
as
well
as
its
rights
and
none
of
these
local
governments
even
if
administered
with
more
regard
to
the
just
demands
of
other
nations
than
they
have
been
would
be
permitted
in
a
spirit
of
eastern
isolation
to
close
the
gates
of
intercourse
of
the
great
highways
of
the
world
and
justify
the
act
by
the
pretension
that
these
avenues
of
trade
and
travel
belong
to
them
and
that
they
choose
to
shut
them
or
what
is
almost
equivalent
to
encumber
them
with
such
unjust
relations
as
would
prevent
their
general
use
we
had
again
and
again
been
forced
to
intervene
to
protect
the
transit
across
the
isthmus
and
the
intervention
was
frequently
at
the
request
of
colombia
herself
the
effort
to
build
a
canal
by
private
capital
had
been
made
under
de
lesseps
and
had
resulted
in
lamentable
failure
every
serious
proposal
to
build
the
canal
in
such
manner
had
been
abandoned
the
united
states
had
repeatedly
announced
that
we
would
not
permit
it
to
be
built
or
controlled
by
any
government
colombia
was
utterly
impotent
to
build
it
herself
under
these
circumstances
it
had
become
a
matter
of
imperative
obligation
that
we
should
build
it
ourselves
without
further
delay
i
took
final
action

during
the
preceding
years

governments
of
new
granada
and
of
its
successor
colombia
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
flux
and
the
state
of
panama
had
sometimes
been
treated
as
almost
independent
in
a
loose
federal
league
and
sometimes
as
the
mere
property
of
the
government
at

there
had
been
innumerable

the
above
is
only
a
partial
list
of
the
revolutions
rebellions
insurrections
riots
and
other
outbreaks
that
occurred
during
the
period
in
question
yet
they
number
for
the
years
and
they
showed
a
tendency
to
increase
rather
than
decrease
in
numbers
and
intensity
one
of
them
lasted
for
nearly
three
years
before
it
was
quelled
another
for
nearly
a
year
in
short
the
experience
of
over
half
a
century
had
shown
colombia
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
keeping
order
on
the
isthmus
only
the
active
interference
of
the
united
states
had
enabled
her
to
preserve
so
much
as
a
semblance
of
sovereignty
had
it
not
been
for
the
exercise
by
the
united
states
of
the
police
power
in
her
interest
her
connection
with
the
isthmus
would
have
been
sundered
long
before
it
was
in
in
in
in
in
and
again
in
sailors
and
marines
from
united
states
warships
were
forced
to
land
in
order
to
patrol
the
isthmus
to
protect
life
and
property
and
to
see
that
the
transit
across
the
isthmus
was
kept
open
in
in
in
and
in
the
colombian
government
asked
that
the
united
states
government
would
land
troops
to
protect
colombian
interests
and
maintain
order
on
the
isthmus
the
people
of
panama
during
the
preceding
twenty
years
had
three
times
sought
to
establish
their
independence
by
revolution
or
secession
in
in
and
in
the
peculiar
relations
of
the
united
states
toward
the
isthmus
and
the
acquiescence
by
colombia
in
acts
which
were
quite
incompatible
with
the
theory
of
her
having
an
absolute
and
unconditioned
sovereignty
on
the
isthmus
are
illustrated
by
the
following
three
telegrams
between
two
of
our
naval
officers
whose
ships
were
at
the
isthmus
and
the
secretary
of
the
navy
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
outbreak
that
occurred
on
the
isthmus
after
i
became
president
a

before

not

which
might

or

casey
when
the
government
in
nominal
control
of
the
isthmus
continually
besought
american
interference
to
protect
the
rights
it
could
not
itself
protect
and
permitted
our
government
to
transport
colombian
troops
unarmed
under
protection
of
our
own
armed
men
while
the
colombian
arms
and
ammunition
came
in
a
separate
train
it
is
obvious
that
the
colombian
sovereignty
was
of
such
a
character
as
to
warrant
our
insisting
that
inasmuch
as
it
only
existed
because
of
our
protection
there
should
be
in
requital
a
sense
of
the
obligations
that
the
acceptance
of
this
protection
implied
meanwhile
colombia
was
under
a
dictatorship
in
sanclamente
was
elected
president
and
maroquin
of
the
republic
of
colombia
on
july
the
maroquin
executed
a
coup
by
seizing
the
person
of
the
president
sanclamente
and
imprisoning
him
at
a
place
a
few
miles
out
of
bogota
maroquin
thereupon
declared
himself
possessed
of
the
executive
power
because
of
the
absence
of
the
president
a
delightful
touch
of
unconscious
humor
he
then
issued
a
decree
that
public
order
was
disturbed
and
upon
that
ground
assumed
to
himself
legislative
power
under
another
provision
of
the
constitution
that
is
having
himself
disturbed
the
public
order
he
alleged
the
disturbance
as
a
justification
for
seizing
absolute
power
thenceforth
maroquin
without
the
aid
of
any
legislative
body
ruled
as
a
dictator
combining
the
supreme
executive
legislative
civil
and
military
authorities
in
the
republic
of
colombia
the
absence
of
sanclamente
from
the
capital
became
permanent
by
his
death
in
prison
in
the
year
when
the
people
of
panama
declared
their
independence
in
november
no
congress
had
sat
in
colombia
since
the
year
except
the
special
congress
called
by
maroquin
to
reject
the
canal
treaty
and
which
did
reject
it
by
a
unanimous
vote
and
adjourned
without
legislating
on
any
other
subject
the
constitution
of
had
taken
away
from
panama
the
power
of
and
vested
it
in
columbia
the
of
maroquin
took
away
from
colombia
herself
the
power
of
government
and
vested
it
in
an
irresponsible
dictator
consideration
of
the
above
facts
ought
to
be
enough
to
show
any
human
being
that
we
were
not
dealing
with
normal
conditions
on
the
isthmus
and
in
colombia
we
were
dealing
with
the
government
of
an
irresponsible
alien
dictator
and
with
a
condition
of
affairs
on
the
isthmus
itself
which
was
marked
by
one
uninterrupted
series
of
outbreaks
and
revolutions
as
for
the
consent
of
the
governed
theory
that
absolutely
justified
our
action
the
people
on
the
isthmus
were
the
governed
they
were
governed
by
colombia
without
their
consent
and
they
unanimously
repudiated
the
colombian
government
and
demanded
that
the
united
states
build
the
canal
i
had
done
everything
possible
personally
and
through
secretary
hay
to
persuade
the
colombian
government
to
keep
faith
under
the
treaty
it
was
explicitly
provided
that
the
united
states
should
build
the
canal
should
control
police
and
protect
it
and
keep
it
open
to
the
vessels
of
all
nations
on
equal
terms
we
had
assumed
the
position
of
guarantor
of
the
canal
including
of
course
the
building
of
the
canal
and
of
its
peaceful
use
by
all
the
world
the
enterprise
was
recognized
everywhere
as
responding
to
an
international
need
it
was
a
mere
travesty
on
justice
to
treat
the
government
in
possession
of
the
isthmus
as
having
the
right
which
secretary
cass
years
before
had
so
emphatically
repudiated
to
close
the
gates
of
intercourse
on
one
of
the
great
highways
of
the
world
when
we
submitted
to
colombia
the
treaty
it
had
been
settled
that
the
time
for
delay
the
time
for
permitting
any
government
of
character
or
of
imperfect
development
to
bar
the
work
had
passed
the
united
states
had
assumed
in
connection
with
the
canal
certain
responsibilities
not
only
to
its
own
people
but
to
the
civilized
world
which
imperatively
demanded
that
there
should
be
no
further
delay
in
beginning
the
work
the
treaty
if
it
erred
at
all
erred
in
being
overgenerous
toward
colombia
the
people
of
panama
were
delighted
with
the
treaty
and
the
president
of
colombia
who
embodied
in
his
own
person
the
entire
government
of
colombia
had
authorized
the
treaty
to
be
made
but
after
the
treaty
had
been
made
the
colombia
government
thought
it
had
the
matter
in
its
own
hands
and
the
further
thought
equally
wicked
and
foolish
came
into
the
heads
of
the
people
in
control
at
bogota
that
they
would
seize
the
french
company
at
the
end
of
another
year
and
take
for
themselves
the
forty
million
dollars
which
the
united
states
had
agreed
to
pay
the
panama
canal
company
president
maroquin
through
his
minister
had
agreed
to
the
treaty
in
january
he
had
the
absolute
power
of
an
unconstitutional
dictator
to
keep
his
promise
or
break
it
he
determined
to
break
it
to
furnish
himself
an
excuse
for
breaking
it
he
devised
the
plan
of
summoning
a
congress
especially
called
to
reject
the
canal
treaty
this
the
congress
a
congress
of
mere
puppets
did
without
a
dissenting
vote
and
the
puppets
adjourned
forthwith
without
legislating
on
any
other
subject
the
fact
that
this
was
a
mere
sham
and
that
the
president
had
entire
power
to
confirm
his
own
treaty
and
act
on
it
if
he
desired
was
shown
as
soon
as
the
revolution
took
place
for
on
november
general
reyes
of
colombia
addressed
the
american
minister
at
bogota
on
behalf
of
president
maroquin
saying
that
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
land
troops
and
restore
the
colombian
sovereignty
the
colombian
president
would
declare
martial
law
and
by
virtue
of
vested
constitutional
authority
when
public
order
is
disturbed
would
approve
by
decree
the
ratification
of
the
canal
treaty
as
signed
or
if
the
government
of
the
united
states
prefers
would
call
an
extra
session
of
the
congress
with
new
and
friendly
members
next
may
to
approve
the
treaty
this
of
course
is
proof
positive
that
the
colombian
dictator
had
used
his
congress
as
a
mere
shield
and
a
sham
shield
at
that
and
it
shows
how
utterly
useless
it
would
have
been
further
to
trust
his
good
faith
in
the
matter
when
in
august
i
became
convinced
that
colombia
intended
to
repudiate
the
treaty
made
the
preceding
january
under
cover
of
securing
its
rejection
by
the
colombian
legislature
i
began
carefully
to
consider
what
should
be
done
by
my
direction
secretary
hay
personally
and
through
the
minister
at
bogota
repeatedly
warned
colombia
that
grave
consequences
might
follow
her
rejection
of
the
treaty
the
possibility
of
ratification
did
not
wholly
pass
away
until
the
close
of
the
session
of
the
colombian
congress
on
the
last
day
of
october
there
would
then
be
two
possibilities
one
was
that
panama
would
remain
quiet
in
that
case
i
was
prepared
to
recommend
to
congress
that
we
should
at
once
occupy
the
isthmus
anyhow
and
proceed
to
dig
the
canal
and
i
had
drawn
out
a
draft
of
my
message
to
this
effect
but
from
the
information
i
received
i
deemed
it
likely
that
there
would
be
a
revolution
in
panama
as
soon
as
the
colombian
congress
adjourned
without
ratifying
the
treaty
for
the
entire
population
of
panama
felt
that
the
immediate
building
of
the
canal
was
of
vital
concern
to
their
correspondents
of
the
different
newspapers
on
the
isthmus
had
sent
to
their
respective
papers
widely
published
forecasts
indicating
that
there
would
be
a
revolution
in
such
event
see
appendix
at
end
of
this
chapter
moreover
on
october
at
the
request
of
young
captain
humphrey
and
lieutenant
murphy
two
army
officers
who
had
returned
from
the
isthmus
saw
me
and
told
me
that
there
would
unquestionably
be
a
revolution
on
the
isthmus
that
the
people
were
unanimous
in
their
criticism
of
the
bogota
government
and
their
disgust
over
the
failure
of
that
government
to
ratify
the
treaty
and
that
the
revolution
would
probably
take
place
immediately
after
the
adjournment
of
the
colombian
congress
they
did
not
believe
that
it
would
be
before
october
but
they
were
confident
that
it
would
certainly
come
at
the
end
of
october
or
immediately
afterwards
when
the
colombian
congress
had
adjourned
accordingly
i
directed
the
navy
department
to
station
various
ships
within
easy
reach
of
the
isthmus
to
be
ready
to
act
in
the
event
of
need
arising
these
ships
were
barely
in
time
on
november
the
revolution
occurred
practically
everybody
on
the
isthmus
including
all
the
colombian
troops
that
were
already
stationed
there
joined
in
the
revolution
and
there
was
no
bloodshed
but
on
that
same
day
four
hundred
new
colombian
troops
were
landed
at
colon
fortunately
the
gunboat
under
commander
hubbard
reached
colon
almost
immediately
afterwards
and
when
the
commander
of
the
colombian
forces
threatened
the
lives
and
property
of
the
american
citizens
including
women
and
children
in
colon
commander
hubbard
landed
a
few
score
sailors
and
marines
to
protect
them
by
a
mixture
of
firmness
and
tact
he
not
only
prevented
any
assault
on
our
citizens
but
persuaded
the
colombian
commander
to
reembark
his
troops
for
cartagena
on
the
pacific
side
a
colombian
gunboat
shelled
the
city
of
panama
with
the
result
of
killing
one
chinaman
the
only
life
lost
in
the
whole
affair
no
one
connected
with
the
american
government
had
any
part
in
preparing
inciting
or
encouraging
the
revolution
and
except
for
the
reports
of
our
military
and
naval
officers
which
i
forwarded
to
congress
no
one
connected
with
the
government
had
any
previous
knowledge
concerning
the
proposed
revolution
except
such
as
was
accessible
to
any
person
who
read
the
newspapers
and
kept
abreast
of
current
questions
and
current
affairs
by
the
unanimous
action
of
its
people
and
without
the
firing
of
a
shot
the
state
of
panama
declared
themselves
an
independent
republic
the
time
for
hesitation
on
our
part
had
passed
my
belief
then
was
and
the
events
that
have
occurred
since
have
more
than
justified
it
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
united
states
it
was
imperative
not
only
for
civil
but
for
military
reasons
that
there
should
be
the
immediate
establishment
of
easy
and
speedy
communication
by
sea
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
these
reasons
were
not
of
convenience
only
but
of
vital
necessity
and
did
not
admit
of
indefinite
delay
the
action
of
colombia
had
shown
not
only
that
the
delay
would
be
indefinite
but
that
she
intended
to
confiscate
the
property
and
rights
of
the
french
panama
canal
company
the
report
of
the
panama
canal
committee
of
the
colombian
senate
on
october
on
the
proposed
treaty
with
the
united
states
proposed
that
all
consideration
of
the
matter
should
be
postponed
until
october
when
the
next
colombian
congress
would
have
convened
because
by
that
time
the
new
congress
would
be
in
condition
to
determine
whether
through
lapse
of
time
the
french
company
had
not
forfeited
its
property
and
rights
when
that
time
arrives
the
report
significantly
declared
the
republic
without
any
impediment
will
be
able
to
contract
and
will
be
in
more
clear
more
definite
and
more
advantageous
possession
both
legally
and
materially
the
naked
meaning
of
this
was
that
colombia
proposed
to
wait
a
year
and
then
enforce
a
forfeiture
of
the
rights
and
property
of
the
french
panama
company
so
as
to
secure
the
forty
million
dollars
our
government
had
authorized
as
payment
to
this
company
if
we
had
sat
supine
this
would
doubtless
have
meant
that
france
would
have
interfered
to
protect
the
company
and
we
should
then
have
had
on
the
isthmus
not
the
company
but
france
and
the
gravest
international
complications
might
have
ensued
every
consideration
of
international
morality
and
expediency
of
duty
to
the
panama
people
and
of
satisfaction
of
our
own
national
interests
and
honor
bade
us
take
immediate
action
i
recognized
panama
forthwith
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
practically
all
the
countries
of
the
world
immediately
followed
suit
the
state
department
immediately
negotiated
a
canal
treaty
with
the
new
republic
one
of
the
foremost
men
in
securing
the
independence
of
panama
and
the
treaty
which
authorized
the
united
states
forthwith
to
build
the
canal

eminent

and
then
living
on
the
isthmus
his
services
to
civilization
were
notable
and
deserve
the
fullest
recognition
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
our
course
was
straightforward
and
in
absolute
accord
with
the
highest
of
standards
of
international
morality
criticism
of
it
can
come
only
from
misinformation
or
else
from
a
sentimentality
which
represents
both
mental
weakness
and
a
moral
twist
to
have
acted
otherwise
than
i
did
would
have
been
on
my
part
betrayal
of
the
interests
of
the
united
states
indifference
to
the
interests
of
panama
and
recreancy
to
the
interests
of
the
world
at
large
colombia
had
forfeited
every
claim
to
consideration
indeed
this
is
not
stating
the
case
strongly
enough
she
had
so
acted
that
yielding
to
her
would
have
meant
on
our
part
that
culpable
form
of
weakness
which
stands
on
a
level
with
wickedness
as
for
me
personally
if
i
had
hesitated
to
act
and
had
not
in
advance
discounted
the
clamor
of
those
americans
who
have
made
a
fetish
of
disloyalty
to
their
country
i
should
have
esteemed
myself
as
deserving
a
place
in
dante
inferno
beside
the
cleric
who
was
guilty
of
il
gran
rifiuto
the
facts
i
have
given
above
are
mere
bald
statements
from
the
record
they
show
that
from
the
beginning
there
had
been
acceptance
of
our
right
to
insist
on
free
transit
in
whatever
form
was
best
across
the
isthmus
and
that
towards
the
end
there
had
been
a
no
less
universal
feeling
that
it
was
our
duty
to
the
world
to
provide
this
transit
in
the
shape
of
a
canal
the
resolution
of
the
congress
was
practically
a
mandate
to
this
effect
colombia
was
then
under
a
government
a
dictatorship
founded
on
usurpation
of
absolute
and
irresponsible
power
she
eagerly
pressed
us
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
her
as
long
as
there
was
any
chance
of
our
going
to
the
alternative
route
through
nicaragua
when
she
thought
we
were
committed
she
refused
to
fulfil
the
agreement
with
the
avowed
hope
of
seizing
the
french
company
property
for
nothing
and
thereby
holding
us
up
this
was
a
bit
of
pure
bandit
morality
it
would
have
achieved
its
purpose
had
i
possessed
as
weak
moral
fiber
as
those
of
my
critics
who
announced
that
i
ought
to
have
confined
my
action
to
feeble
scolding
and
temporizing
until
the
opportunity
for
action
passed
i
did
not
lift
my
finger
to
incite
the
revolutionists
the
right
simile
to
use
is
totally
different
i
simply
ceased
to
stamp
out
the
different
revolutionary
fuses
that
were
already
burning
when
colombia
committed
flagrant
wrong
against
us
i
considered
it
no
part
of
my
duty
to
aid
and
abet
her
in
her
wrongdoing
at
our
expense
and
also
at
the
expense
of
panama
of
the
french
company
and
of
the
world
generally
there
had
been
fifty
years
of
continuous
bloodshed
and
civil
strife
in
panama
because
of
my
action
panama
has
now
known
ten
years
of
such
peace
and
prosperity
as
she
never
before
saw
during
the
four
centuries
of
her
existence
for
in
panama
as
in
cuba
and
santo
domingo
it
was
the
action
of
the
american
people
against
the
outcries
of
the
professed
apostles
of
peace
which
alone
brought
peace
we
gave
to
the
people
of
panama
and
freed
them
from
subjection
to
alien
oppressors
we
did
our
best
to
get
colombia
to
let
us
treat
her
with
a
more
than
generous
justice
we
exercised
patience
to
beyond
the
verge
of
proper
forbearance
when
we
did
act
and
recognize
panama
colombia
at
once
acknowledged
her
own
guilt
by
promptly
offering
to
do
what
we
had
demanded
and
what
she
had
protested
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
do
but
the
offer
came
too
late
what
we
would
gladly
have
done
before
it
had
by
that
time
become
impossible
for
us
honorably
to
do
for
it
would
have
necessitated
our
abandoning
the
people
of
panama
our
friends
and
turning
them
over
to
their
and
our
foes
who
would
have
wreaked
vengeance
on
them
precisely
because
they
had
shown
friendship
to
us
colombia
was
solely
responsible
for
her
own
humiliation
and
she
had
not
then
and
has
not
now
one
shadow
of
claim
upon
us
moral
or
legal
all
the
wrong
that
was
done
was
done
by
her
if
as
representing
the
american
people
i
had
not
acted
precisely
as
i
did
i
would
have
been
an
unfaithful
or
incompetent
representative
and
inaction
at
that
crisis
would
have
meant
not
only
indefinite
delay
in
building
the
canal
but
also
practical
admission
on
our
part
that
we
were
not
fit
to
play
the
part
on
the
isthmus
which
we
had
arrogated
to
ourselves
i
acted
on
my
own
responsibility
in
the
panama
matter
john
hay
spoke
of
this
action
as
follows
the
action
of
the
president
in
the
panama
matter
is
not
only
in
the
strictest
accordance
with
the
principles
of
justice
and
equity
and
in
line
with
all
the
best
precedents
of
our
public
policy
but
it
was
the
only
course
he
could
have
taken
in
compliance
with
our
treaty
rights
and
obligations
i
deeply
regretted
and
now
deeply
regret
the
fact
that
the
colombian
government
rendered
it
imperative
for
me
to
take
the
action
i
took
but
i
had
no
alternative
consistent
with
the
full
performance
of
my
duty
to
my
own
people
and
to
the
nations
of
mankind
for
be
it
remembered
that
certain
other
nations
chile
for
example
will
probably
benefit
even
more
by
our
action
than
will
the
united
states
itself
i
am
well
aware
that
the
colombian
people
have
many
fine
traits
that
there
is
among
them
a
circle
of
men
and
women
which
would
reflect
honor
on
the
social
life
of
any
country
and
that
there
has
been
an
intellectual
and
literary
development
within
this
small
circle
which
partially
atones
for
the
stagnation
and
illiteracy
of
the
mass
of
the
people
and
i
also
know
that
even
the
illiterate
mass
possesses
many
sterling
qualities
but
unfortunately
in
international
matters
every
nation
must
be
judged
by
the
action
of
its
government
the
good
people
in
colombia
apparently
made
no
effort
certainly
no
successful
effort
to
cause
the
government
to
act
with
reasonable
good
faith
towards
the
united
states
and
colombia
had
to
take
the
consequences
if
brazil
or
the
argentine
or
chile
had
been
in
possession
of
the
isthmus
doubtless
the
canal
would
have
been
built
under
the
governmental
control
of
the
nation
thus
controlling
the
isthmus
with
the
hearty
acquiescence
of
the
united
states
and
of
all
other
powers
but
in
the
actual
fact
the
canal
would
not
have
been
built
at
all
save
for
the
action
i
took
if
men
choose
to
say
that
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
build
it
than
to
build
it
as
the
result
of
such
action
their
position
although
foolish
is
compatible
with
belief
in
their
wrongheaded
sincerity
but
it
is
hypocrisy
alike
odious
and
contemptible
for
any
man
to
say
both
that
we
ought
to
have
built
the
canal
and
that
we
ought
not
to
have
acted
in
the
way
we
did
act
after
a
sufficient
period
of
wrangling
the
senate
ratified
the
treaty
with
panama
and
work
on
the
canal
was
begun
the
first
thing
that
was
necessary
was
to
decide
the
type
of
canal
i
summoned
a
board
of
engineering
experts
foreign
and
native
they
divided
on
their
report
the
majority
of
the
members
including
all
the
foreign
members
approved
a
canal
the
minority
including
most
of
the
american
members
approved
a
lock
canal
studying
these
conclusions
i
came
to
the
belief
that
the
minority
was
right
the
two
great
traffic
canals
of
the
world
were
the
suez
and
the
soo
the
suez
canal
is
a
canal
and
it
was
the
one
best
known
to
european
engineers
the
soo
canal
through
which
an
even
greater
volume
of
traffic
passes
every
year
is
a
lock
canal
and
the
american
engineers
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
whereas
in
my
judgment
the
european
engineers
had
failed
to
pay
proper
heed
to
the
lessons
taught
by
its
operation
and
management
moreover
the
engineers
who
were
to
do
the
work
at
panama
all
favored
a
lock
canal
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
canal
would
be
slightly
less
exposed
to
damage
in
the
event
of
war
that
the
running
expenses
apart
from
the
heavy
cost
of
interest
on
the
amount
necessary
to
build
it
would
be
less
and
that
for
small
ships
the
time
of
transit
would
be
less
but
i
also
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lock
canal
at
the
proposed
level
would
cost
only
about
half
as
much
to
build
and
would
be
built
in
half
the
time
with
much
less
risk
that
for
large
ships
the
transit
would
be
quicker
and
that
taking
into
account
the
interest
saved
the
cost
of
maintenance
would
be
less
accordingly
i
recommended
to
congress
on
february
that
a
lock
canal
should
be
built
and
my
recommendation
was
adopted
congress
insisted
upon
having
it
built
by
a
commission
of
several
men
i
tried
faithfully
to
get
good
work
out
of
the
commission
and
found
it
quite
impossible
for
a
commission
is
an
extremely
poor
executive
instrument
at
last
i
put
colonel
goethals
in
as
head
of
the
commission
then
when
congress
still
refused
to
make
the
commission
i
solved
the
difficulty
by
an
executive
order
of
january
which
practically
accomplished
the
object
by
enlarging
the
powers
of
the
chairman
making
all
the
other
members
of
the
commission
dependent
upon
him
and
thereby
placing
the
work
under
control
gorgas
had
already
performed
an
inestimable
service
by
caring
for
the
sanitary
conditions
so
thoroughly
as
to
make
the
isthmus
as
safe
as
a
health
resort
colonel
goethals
proved
to
be
the
man
of
all
others
to
do
the
job
it
would
be
impossible
to
overstate
what
he
has
done
it
is
the
greatest
task
of
any
kind
that
any
man
in
the
world
has
accomplished
during
the
years
that
colonel
goethals
has
been
at
work
it
is
the
greatest
task
of
its
own
kind
that
has
ever
been
performed
in
the
world
at
all
colonel
goethals
has
succeeded
in
instilling
into
the
men
under
him
a
spirit
which
elsewhere
has
been
found
only
in
a
few
victorious
armies
it
is
proper
and
appropriate
that
like
the
soldiers
of
such
armies
they
should
receive
medals
which
are
allotted
each
man
who
has
served
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
a
finer
body
of
men
has
never
been
gathered
by
any
nation
than
the
men
who
have
done
the
work
of
building
the
panama
canal
the
conditions
under
which
they
have
lived
and
have
done
their
work
have
been
better
than
in
any
similar
work
ever
undertaken
in
the
tropics
they
have
all
felt
an
eager
pride
in
their
work
and
they
have
made
not
only
america
but
the
whole
world
their
debtors
by
what
they
have
accomplished
appendix
colombia
the
proposed
message
to
congress
the
rough
draft
of
the
message
i
had
proposed
to
send
congress
ran
as
follows
the
colombian
government
through
its
representative
here
and
directly
in
communication
with
our
representative
at
colombia
has
refused
to
come
to
any
agreement
with
us
and
has
delayed
action
so
as
to
make
it
evident
that
it
intends
to
make
extortionate
and
improper
terms
with
us
the
isthmian
canal
bill
was
of
course
passed
upon
the
assumption
that
whatever
route
was
used
the
benefit
to
the
particular
section
of
the
isthmus
through
which
it
passed
would
be
so
great
that
the
country
controlling
this
part
would
be
eager
to
facilitate
the
building
of
the
canal
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
submit
to
extortion
on
the
part
of
a
beneficiary
of
the
scheme
all
the
labor
all
the
expense
all
the
risk
are
to
be
assumed
by
us
and
all
the
skill
shown
by
us
those
controlling
the
ground
through
which
the
canal
is
to
be
put
are
wholly
incapable
of
building
it
yet
the
interest
of
international
commerce
generally
and
the
interest
of
this
country
generally
demands
that
the
canal
should
be
begun
with
no
needless
delay
the
refusal
of
colombia
properly
to
respond
to
our
sincere
and
earnest
efforts
to
come
to
an
agreement
or
to
pay
heed
to
the
many
concessions
we
have
made
renders
it
in
my
judgment
necessary
that
the
united
states
should
take
immediate
action
on
one
of
two
lines
either
we
should
drop
the
panama
canal
project
and
immediately
begin
work
on
the
nicaraguan
canal
or
else
we
should
purchase
all
the
rights
of
the
french
company
and
without
any
further
parley
with
colombia
enter
upon
the
completion
of
the
canal
which
the
french
company
has
begun
i
feel
that
the
latter
course
is
the
one
demanded
by
the
interests
of
this
nation
and
i
therefore
bring
the
matter
to
your
attention
for
such
action
in
the
premises
as
you
may
deem
wise
if
in
your
judgment
it
is
better
not
to
take
such
action
then
i
shall
proceed
at
once
with
the
nicaraguan
canal
the
reason
that
i
advocate
the
action
above
outlined
in
regard
to
the
panama
canal
is
in
the
first
place
the
strong
testimony
of
the
experts
that
this
route
is
the
most
feasible
and
in
the
next
place
the
impropriety
from
an
international
standpoint
of
permitting
such
conduct
as
that
to
which
colombia
seems
to
incline
the
testimony
of
the
experts
is
very
strong
not
only
that
the
panama
route
is
feasible
but
that
in
the
nicaragua
route
we
may
encounter
some
unpleasant
surprises
and
that
it
is
far
more
difficult
to
forecast
the
result
with
any
certainty
as
regards
this
latter
route
as
for
colombia
attitude
it
is
incomprehensible
upon
any
theory
of
desire
to
see
the
canal
built
upon
the
basis
of
mutual
advantage
alike
to
those
building
it
and
to
colombia
herself
all
we
desire
to
do
is
to
take
up
the
work
begun
by
the
french
government
and
to
finish
it
obviously
it
is
colombia
duty
to
help
towards
such
completion
we
are
most
anxious
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
her
in
which
most
scrupulous
care
should
be
taken
to
guard
her
interests
and
ours
but
we
can
not
consent
to
permit
her
to
block
the
performance
of
the
work
which
it
is
so
greatly
to
our
interest
immediately
to
begin
and
carry
through
shortly
after
this
rough
draft
was
dictated
the
panama
revolution
came
and
i
never
thought
of
the
rough
draft
again
until
i
was
accused
of
having
instigated
the
revolution
this
accusation
is
preposterous
in
the
eyes
of
any
one
who
knows
the
actual
conditions
at
panama
only
the
menace
of
action
by
us
in
the
interest
of
colombia
kept
down
revolution
as
soon
as
colombia
own
conduct
removed
such
menace
all
check
on
the
various
revolutionary
movements
there
were
at
least
three
from
entirely
separate
sources
ceased
and
then
an
explosion
was
inevitable
for
the
french
company
knew
that
all
their
property
would
be
confiscated
if
colombia
put
through
her
plans
and
the
entire
people
of
panama
felt
that
if
in
disgust
with
colombia
extortions
the
united
states
turned
to
nicaragua
they
the
people
of
panama
would
be
ruined
knowing
the
character
of
those
then
in
charge
of
the
colombian
government
i
was
not
surprised
at
their
bad
faith
but
i
was
surprised
at
their
folly
they
apparently
had
no
idea
either
of
the
power
of
france
or
the
power
of
the
united
states
and
expected
to
be
permitted
to
commit
wrong
with
impunity
just
as
castro
in
venezuela
had
done
the
difference
was
that
unless
we
acted
in
colombia
had
it
in
her
power
to
do
us
serious
harm
and
venezuela
did
not
have
such
power
wrongdoing
therefore
recoiled
on
her
own
head
there
was
no
new
lesson
taught
it
ought
already
to
have
been
known
to
every
one
that
wickedness
weakness
and
folly
combined
rarely
fail
to
meet
punishment
and
that
the
intent
to
do
wrong
when
joined
to
inability
to
carry
the
evil
purpose
to
a
successful
conclusion
inevitably
reacts
on
the
wrongdoer
for
the
full
history
of
the
acquisition
and
building

bishop
has
been
for
eight
years
secretary
of
the
commission
and
is
one
of
the
most
efficient
of
the
many
efficient
men

whose

owes
so
much
chapter
xv
the
peace
of
righteousness
there
can
be
no
nobler
cause
for
which
to
work
than
the
peace
of
righteousness
and
high
honor
is
due
those
serene
and
lofty
souls
who
with
wisdom
and
courage
with
high
idealism
tempered
by
sane
facing
of
the
actual
facts
of
life
have
striven
to
bring
nearer
the
day
when
armed
strife
between
nation
and
nation
between
class
and
class
between
man
and
man
shall
end
throughout
the
world
because
all
this
is
true
it
is
also
true
that
there
are
no
men
more
ignoble
or
more
foolish
no
men
whose
actions
are
fraught
with
greater
possibility
of
mischief
to
their
country
and
to
mankind
than
those
who
exalt
unrighteous
peace
as
better
than
righteous
war
the
men
who
have
stood
highest
in
our
history
as
in
the
history
of
all
countries
are
those
who
scorned
injustice
who
were
incapable
of
oppressing
the
weak
or
of
permitting
their
country
with
their
consent
to
oppress
the
weak
but
who
did
not
hesitate
to
draw
the
sword
when
to
leave
it
undrawn
meant
inability
to
arrest
triumphant
wrong
all
this
is
so
obvious
that
it
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
repeat
it
yet
every
man
in
active
affairs
who
also
reads
about
the
past
grows
by
bitter
experience
to
realize
that
there
are
plenty
of
men
not
only
among
those
who
mean
ill
but
among
those
who
mean
well
who
are
ready
enough
to
praise
what
was
done
in
the
past
and
yet
are
incapable
of
profiting
by
it
when
faced
by
the
needs
of
the
present
during
our
generation
this
seems
to
have
been
peculiarly
the
case
among
the
men
who
have
become
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
obtaining
universal
peace
by
some
cheap
patent
panacea
there
has
been
a
real
and
substantial
growth
in
the
feeling
for
international
responsibility
and
justice
among
the
great
civilized
nations
during
the
past
threescore
or
fourscore
years
there
has
been
a
real
growth
of
recognition
of
the
fact
that
moral
turpitude
is
involved
in
the
wronging
of
one
nation
by
another
and
that
in
most
cases
war
is
an
evil
method
of
settling
international
difficulties
but
as
yet
there
has
been
only
a
rudimentary
beginning
of
the
development
of
international
tribunals
of
justice
and
there
has
been
no
development
at
all
of
any
international
police
power
now
as
i
have
already
said
the
whole
fabric
of
municipal
law
of
law
within
each
nation
rests
ultimately
upon
the
judge
and
the
policeman
and
the
complete
absence
of
the
policeman
and
the
almost
complete
absence
of
the
judge
in
international
affairs
prevents
there
being
as
yet
any
real
homology
between
municipal
and
international
law
moreover
the
questions
which
sometimes
involve
nations
in
war
are
far
more
difficult
and
complex
than
any
questions
that
affect
merely
individuals
almost
every
great
nation
has
inherited
certain
questions
either
with
other
nations
or
with
sections
of
its
own
people
which
it
is
quite
impossible
in
the
present
state
of
civilization
to
decide
as
matters
between
private
individuals
can
be
decided
during
the
last
century
at
least
half
of
the
wars
that
have
been
fought
have
been
civil
and
not
foreign
wars
there
are
big
and
powerful
nations
which
habitually
commit
either
upon
other
nations
or
upon
sections
of
their
own
people
wrongs
so
outrageous
as
to
justify
even
the
most
peaceful
persons
in
going
to
war
there
are
also
weak
nations
so
utterly
incompetent
either
to
protect
the
rights
of
foreigners
against
their
own
citizens
or
to
protect
their
own
citizens
against
foreigners
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
sheer
duty
for
some
outside
power
to
interfere
in
connection
with
them
as
yet
in
neither
case
is
there
any
efficient
method
of
getting
international
action
and
if
joint
action
by
several
powers
is
secured
the
result
is
usually
considerably
worse
than
if
only
one
power
interfered
the
worst
infamies
of
modern
times
such
affairs
as
the
massacres
of
the
armenians
by
the
turks
for
instance
have
been
perpetrated
in
a
time
of
nominally
profound
international
peace
when
there
has
been
a
concert
of
big
powers
to
prevent
the
breaking
of
this
peace
although
only
by
breaking
it
could
the
outrages
be
stopped
be
it
remembered
that
the
peoples
who
suffered
by
these
hideous
massacres
who
saw
their
women
violated
and
their
children
tortured
were
actually
enjoying
all
the
benefits
of
disarmament
otherwise
they
would
not
have
been
massacred
for
if
the
jews
in
russia
and
the
armenians
in
turkey
had
been
armed
and
had
been
efficient
in
the
use
of
their
arms
no
mob
would
have
meddled
with
them
yet
amiable
but
fatuous
persons
with
all
these
facts
before
their
eyes
pass
resolutions
demanding
universal
arbitration
for
everything
and
the
disarmament
of
the
free
civilized
powers
and
their
abandonment
of
their
armed
forces
or
else
they
write
solemn
little
books
or
pamphlets
or
editorials
and
articles
in
magazines
or
newspapers
to
show
that
it
is
an
illusion
to
believe
that
war
ever
pays
because
it
is
expensive
this
is
precisely
like
arguing
that
we
should
disband
the
police
and
devote
our
sole
attention
to
persuading
criminals
that
it
is
an
illusion
to
suppose
that
burglary
highway
robbery
and
white
slavery
are
profitable
it
is
almost
useless
to
attempt
to
argue
with
these
persons
because
they
are
suffering
under
an
obsession
and
are
not
open
to
reason
they
go
wrong
at
the
outset
for
they
lay
all
the
emphasis
on
peace
and
none
at
all
on
righteousness
they
are
not
all
of
them
physically
timid
men
but
they
are
usually
men
of
soft
life
and
they
rarely
possess
a
high
sense
of
honor
or
a
keen
patriotism
they
rarely
try
to
prevent
their
fellow
countrymen
from
insulting
or
wronging
the
people
of
other
nations
but
they
always
ardently
advocate
that
we
in
our
turn
shall
tamely
submit
to
wrong
and
insult
from
other
nations
as
americans
their
folly
is
peculiarly
scandalous
because
if
the
principles
they
now
uphold
are
right
it
means
that
it
would
have
been
better
that
americans
should
never
have
achieved
their
independence
and
better
that
in
they
should
have
peacefully
submitted
to
seeing
their
country
split
into
half
a
dozen
jangling
confederacies
and
slavery
made
perpetual
if
unwilling
to
learn
from
their
own
history
let
those
who
think
that
it
is
an
illusion
to
believe
that
a
war
ever
benefits
a
nation
look
at
the
difference
between
china
and
japan
china
has
neither
a
fleet
nor
an
efficient
army
it
is
a
huge
civilized
empire
one
of
the
most
populous
on
the
globe
and
it
has
been
the
helpless
prey
of
outsiders
because
it
does
not
possess
the
power
to
fight
japan
stands
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
european
and
american
nations
because
it
does
possess
this
power
china
now
sees
japan
russia
germany
england
and
france
in
possession
of
fragments
of
her
empire
and
has
twice
within
the
lifetime
of
the
present
generation
seen
her
capital
in
the
hands
of
allied
invaders
because
she
in
very
fact
realizes
the
ideals
of
the
persons
who
wish
the
united
states
to
disarm
and
then
trust
that
our
helplessness
will
secure
us
a
contemptuous
immunity
from
attack
by
outside
nations
the
chief
trouble
comes
from
the
entire
inability
of
these
worthy
people
to
understand
that
they
are
demanding
things
that
are
mutually
incompatible
when
they
demand
peace
at
any
price
and
also
justice
and
righteousness
i
remember
one
representative
of
their
number
who
used
to
write
little
sonnets
on
behalf
of
the
mahdi
and
the
sudanese
these
sonnets
setting
forth
the
need
that
the
sudan
should
be
both
independent
and
peaceful
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
sudan
valued
independence
only
because
it
desired
to
war
against
all
christians
and
to
carry
on
an
unlimited
slave
trade
it
was
independent
under
the
mahdi
for
a
dozen
years
and
during
those
dozen
years
the
bigotry
tyranny
and
cruel
religious
intolerance
were
such
as
flourished
in
the
seventh
century
and
in
spite
of
systematic
slave
raids
the
population
decreased
by
nearly
and
practically
all
the
children
died
peace
came
came
freedom
from
rape
and
murder
and
torture
and
highway
robbery
and
every
brutal
gratification
of
lust
and
greed
came
only
when
the
sudan
lost
its
independence
and
passed
under
english
rule
yet
this
little
sonneteer
sincerely
felt
that
his
verses
were
issued
in
the
cause
of
humanity
looking
back
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
score
of
years
probably
every
one
will
agree
that
he
was
an
absurd
person
but
he
was
not
one
whit
more
absurd
than
most
of
the
more
prominent
persons
who
advocate
disarmament
by
the
united
states
the
cessation
of
the
navy
and
the
promise
to
agree
to
arbitrate
all
matters
including
those
affecting
our
national
interests
and
honor
with
all
foreign
nations
these
persons
would
do
no
harm
if
they
affected
only
themselves
many
of
them
are
in
the
ordinary
relations
of
life
good
citizens
they
are
exactly
like
the
other
good
citizens
who
believe
that
enforced
universal
vegetarianism
or
is
the
panacea
for
all
ills
but
in
their
particular
case
they
are
able
to
do
harm
because
they
affect
our
relations
with
foreign
powers
so
that
other
men
pay
the
debt
which
they
themselves
have
really
incurred
it
is
the
foolish
persons
who
try
to
persuade
our
people
to
make
unwise
and
improper
treaties
or
to
stop
building
up
the
navy
but
if
trouble
comes
and
the
treaties
are
repudiated
or
there
is
a
demand
for
armed
intervention
it
is
not
these
people
who
will
pay
anything
they
will
stay
at
home
in
safety
and
leave
brave
men
to
pay
in
blood
and
honest
men
to
pay
in
shame
for
their
folly
the
trouble
is
that
our
policy
is
apt
to
go
in
zigzags
because
different
sections
of
our
people
exercise
at
different
times
unequal
pressure
on
our
government
one
class
of
our
citizens
clamors
for
treaties
impossible
of
fulfilment
and
improper
to
fulfil
another
class
has
no
objection
to
the
passage
of
these
treaties
so
long
as
there
is
no
concrete
case
to
which
they
apply
but
instantly
oppose
a
veto
on
their
application
when
any
concrete
case
does
actually
arise
one
of
our
cardinal
doctrines
is
freedom
of
speech
which
means
freedom
of
speech
about
foreigners
as
well
as
about
ourselves
and
inasmuch
as
we
exercise
this
right
with
complete
absence
of
restraint
we
can
not
expect
other
nations
to
hold
us
harmless
unless
in
the
last
resort
we
are
able
to
make
our
own
words
good
by
our
deeds
one
class
of
our
citizens
indulges
in
gushing
promises
to
do
everything
for
foreigners
another
class
offensively
and
improperly
reviles
them
and
it
is
hard
to
say
which
class
more
thoroughly
misrepresents
the
sober
judgment
of
the
american
people
as
a
whole
the
only
safe
rule
is
to
promise
little
and
faithfully
to
keep
every
promise
to
speak
softly
and
carry
a
big
stick
a
prime
need
for
our
nation
as
of
course
for
every
other
nation
is
to
make
up
its
mind
definitely
what
it
wishes
and
not
to
try
to
pursue
paths
of
conduct
incompatible
one
with
the
other
if
this
nation
is
content
to
be
the
china
of
the
new
world
then
and
then
only
can
it
afford
to
do
away
with
the
navy
and
the
army
if
it
is
content
to
abandon
hawaii
and
the
panama
canal
to
cease
to
talk
of
the
monroe
doctrine
and
to
admit
the
right
of
any
european
or
asiatic
power
to
dictate
what
immigrants
shall
be
sent
to
and
received
in
america
and
whether
or
not
they
shall
be
allowed
to
become
citizens
and
hold
land
why
of
course
if
america
is
content
to
have
nothing
to
say
on
any
of
these
matters
and
to
keep
silent
in
the
presence
of
armed
outsiders
then
it
can
abandon
its
navy
and
agree
to
arbitrate
all
questions
of
all
kinds
with
every
foreign
power
in
such
event
it
can
afford
to
pass
its
spare
time
in
one
continuous
round
of
universal
peace
celebrations
and
of
smug
in
having
earned
the
derision
of
all
the
virile
peoples
of
mankind
those
who
advocate
such
a
policy
do
not
occupy
a
lofty
position
but
at
least
their
position
is
understandable
it
is
entirely
inexcusable
however
to
try
to
combine
the
unready
hand
with
the
unbridled
tongue
it
is
folly
to
permit
freedom
of
speech
about
foreigners
as
well
as
ourselves
and
the
persons
are
much
too
feeble
a
folk
to
try
to
interfere
with
freedom
of
speech
and
yet
to
try
to
shirk
the
consequences
of
freedom
of
speech
it
is
folly
to
try
to
abolish
our
navy
and
at
the
same
time
to
insist
that
we
have
a
right
to
enforce
the
monroe
doctrine
that
we
have
a
right
to
control
the
panama
canal
which
we
ourselves
dug
that
we
have
a
right
to
retain
hawaii
and
prevent
foreign
nations
from
taking
cuba
and
a
right
to
determine
what
immigrants
asiatic
or
european
shall
come
to
our
shores
and
the
terms
on
which
they
shall
be
naturalized
and
shall
hold
land
and
exercise
other
privileges
we
are
a
rich
people
and
an
unmilitary
people
in
international
affairs
we
are
a
people
but
i
know
my
countrymen
down
at
bottom
their
temper
is
such
that
they
will
not
permanently
tolerate
injustice
done
to
them
in
the
long
run
they
will
no
more
permit
affronts
to
their
national
honor
than
injuries
to
their
national
interest
such
being
the
case
they
will
do
well
to
remember
that
the
surest
of
all
ways
to
invite
disaster
is
to
be
opulent
aggressive
and
unarmed
throughout
the
seven
and
a
half
years
that
i
was
president
i
pursued
without
faltering
one
consistent
foreign
policy
a
policy
of
genuine
international
good
will
and
of
consideration
for
the
rights
of
others
and
at
the
same
time
of
steady
preparedness
the
weakest
nations
knew
that
they
no
less
than
the
strongest
were
safe
from
insult
and
injury
at
our
hands
and
the
strong
and
the
weak
alike
also
knew
that
we
possessed
both
the
will
and
the
ability
to
guard
ourselves
from
wrong
or
insult
at
the
hands
of
any
one
it
was
under
my
administration
that
the
hague
court
was
saved
from
becoming
an
empty
farce
it
had
been
established
by
joint
international
agreement
but
no
power
had
been
willing
to
resort
to
it
those
establishing
it
had
grown
to
realize
that
it
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
mere
paper
court
so
that
it
would
never
really
come
into
being
at
all
de
constant
had
been
especially
alive
to
this
danger
by
correspondence
and
in
personal
interviews
he
impressed
upon
me
the
need
not
only
of
making
advances
by
actually
applying
arbitration
not
merely
promising
by
treaty
to
apply
it
to
questions
that
were
up
for
settlement
but
of
using
the
hague
tribunal
for
this
purpose
i
cordially
sympathized
with
these
views
on
the
recommendation
of
john
hay
i
succeeded
in
getting
an
agreement
with
mexico
to
lay
a
matter
in
dispute
between
the
two
republics
before
the
hague
court
this
was
the
first
case
ever
brought
before
the
hague
court
it
was
followed
by
numerous
others
and
it
definitely
established
that
court
as
the
great
international
peace
tribunal
by
mutual
agreement
with
great
britain
through
the
decision
of
a
joint
commission
of
which
the
american
members
were
senators
lodge
and
turner
and
secretary
root
we
were
able
peacefully
to
settle
the
alaska
boundary
question
the
only
question
remaining
between
ourselves
and
the
british
empire
which
it
was
not
possible
to
settle
by
friendly
arbitration
this
therefore
represented
the
removal
of
the
last
obstacle
to
absolute
agreement
between
the
two
peoples
we
were
of
substantial
service
in
bringing
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
the
negotiations
at
algeciras
concerning
morocco
we
concluded
with
great
britain
and
with
most
of
the
other
great
nations
arbitration
treaties
specifically
agreeing
to
arbitrate
all
matters
and
especially
the
interpretation
of
treaties
save
only
as
regards
questions
affecting
territorial
integrity
national
honor
and
vital
national
interest
we
made
with
great
britain
a
treaty
guaranteeing
the
free
use
of
the
panama
canal
on
equal
terms
to
the
ships
of
all
nations
while
reserving
to
ourselves
the
right
to
police
and
fortify
the
canal
and
therefore
to
control
it
in
time
of
war
under
this
treaty
we
are
in
honor
bound
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
canal
tolls
for
coastwise
traffic
between
the
western
and
eastern
coasts
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
the
american
position
as
regards
this
matter
is
right
but
i
also
believe
that
under
the
arbitration
treaty
we
are
in
honor
bound
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration
in
view
of
great
contention
although
i
hold
it
to
be
an
unwise
contention
that
our
position
is
unsound
i
emphatically
disbelieve
in
making
universal
arbitration
treaties
which
neither
the
makers
nor
any
one
else
would
for
a
moment
dream
of
keeping
i
no
less
emphatically
insist
that
it
is
our
duty
to
keep
the
limited
and
sensible
arbitration
treaties
which
we
have
already
made
the
importance
of
a
promise
lies
not
in
making
it
but
in
keeping
it
and
the
poorest
of
all
positions
for
a
nation
to
occupy
in
such
a
matter
is
readiness
to
make
impossible
promises
at
the
same
time
that
there
is
failure
to
keep
promises
which
have
been
made
which
can
be
kept
and
which
it
is
discreditable
to
break
during
the
early
part
of
the
year
the
strain
on
the
civilized
world
caused
by
the
war
became
serious
the
losses
of
life
and
of
treasure
were
frightful
from
all
the
sources
of
information
at
hand
i
grew
most
strongly
to
believe
that
a
further
continuation
of
the
struggle
would
be
a
very
bad
thing
for
japan
and
an
even
worse
thing
for
russia
japan
was
already
suffering
terribly
from
the
drain
upon
her
men
and
especially
upon
her
resources
and
had
nothing
further
to
gain
from
continuance
of
the
struggle
its
continuance
meant
to
her
more
loss
than
gain
even
if
she
were
victorious
russia
in
spite
of
her
gigantic
strength
was
in
my
judgment
apt
to
lose
even
more
than
she
had
already
lost
if
the
struggle
continued
i
deemed
it
probable
that
she
would
no
more
be
able
successfully
to
defend
eastern
siberia
and
northern
manchuria
than
she
had
been
able
to
defend
southern
manchuria
and
korea
if
the
war
went
on
i
thought
it
on
the
whole
likely
that
russia
would
be
driven
west
of
lake
baikal
but
it
was
very
far
from
certain
there
is
no
certainty
in
such
a
war
japan
might
have
met
defeat
and
defeat
to
her
would
have
spelt
overwhelming
disaster
and
even
if
she
had
continued
to
win
what
she
thus
won
would
have
been
of
no
value
to
her
and
the
cost
in
blood
and
money
would
have
left
her
drained
white
i
believed
therefore
that
the
time
had
come
when
it
was
greatly
to
the
interest
of
both
combatants
to
have
peace
and
when
therefore
it
was
possible
to
get
both
to
agree
to
peace
i
first
satisfied
myself
that
each
side
wished
me
to
act
but
that
naturally
and
properly
each
side
was
exceedingly
anxious
that
the
other
should
not
believe
that
the
action
was
taken
on
its
initiative
i
then
sent
an
identical
note
to
the
two
powers
proposing
that
they
should
meet
through
their
representatives
to
see
if
peace
could
not
be
made
directly
between
them
and
offered
to
act
as
an
intermediary
in
bringing
about
such
a
meeting
but
not
for
any
other
purpose
each
assented
to
my
proposal
in
principle
there
was
difficulty
in
getting
them
to
agree
on
a
common
meeting
place
but
each
finally
abandoned
its
original
contention
in
the
matter
and
the
representatives
of
the
two
nations
finally
met
at
portsmouth
in
new
hampshire
i
previously
received
the
two
delegations
at
oyster
bay
on
the
mayflower
which
together
with
another
naval
vessel
i
put
at
their
disposal
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government
to
take
them
from
oyster
bay
to
portsmouth
as
is
customary
but
both
unwise
and
undesirable
in
such
cases
each
side
advanced
claims
which
the
other
could
not
grant
the
chief
difficulty
came
because
of
japan
demand
for
a
money
indemnity
i
felt
that
it
would
be
better
for
russia
to
pay
some
indemnity
than
to
go
on
with
the
war
for
there
was
little
chance
in
my
judgment
of
the
war
turning
out
favorably
for
russia
and
the
revolutionary
movement
already
under
way
bade
fair
to
overthrow
the
negotiations
entirely
i
advised
the
russian
government
to
this
effect
at
the
same
time
urging
them
to
abandon
their
pretensions
on
certain
other
points
notably
concerning
the
southern
half
of
saghalien
which
the
japanese
had
taken
i
also
however
and
equally
strongly
advised
the
japanese
that
in
my
judgment
it
would
be
the
gravest
mistake
on
their
part
to
insist
on
continuing
the
war
for
the
sake
of
a
money
indemnity
for
russia
was
absolutely
firm
in
refusing
to
give
them
an
indemnity
and
the
longer
the
war
continued
the
less
able
she
would
be
to
pay
i
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
possible
analogy
between
their
case
and
that
of
germany
in
the
war
with
france
which
they
were
fond
of
quoting
the
germans
held
paris
and
half
of
france
and
gave
up
much
territory
in
lieu
of
the
indemnity
whereas
the
japanese
were
still
many
thousand
miles
from
moscow
and
had
no
territory
whatever
which
they
wished
to
give
up
i
also
pointed
out
that
in
my
judgment
whereas
the
japanese
had
enjoyed
the
sympathy
of
most
of
the
civilized
powers
at
the
outset
of
and
during
the
continuance
of
the
war
they
would
forfeit
it
if
they
turned
the
war
into
one
merely
for
getting
money
and
moreover
they
would
almost
certainly
fail
to
get
the
money
and
would
simply
find
themselves
at
the
end
of
a
year
even
if
things
prospered
with
them
in
possession
of
territory
they
did
not
want
having
spent
enormous
additional
sums
of
money
and
lost
enormous
additional
numbers
of
men
and
yet
without
a
penny
of
remuneration
the
treaty
of
peace
was
finally
signed
as
is
inevitable
under
such
circumstances
each
side
felt
that
it
ought
to
have
got
better
terms
and
when
the
danger
was
well
past
each
side
felt
that
it
had
been
by
the
other
and
that
if
the
war
had
gone
on
it
would
have
gotten
more
than
it
actually
did
get
the
japanese
government
had
been
wise
throughout
except
in
the
matter
of
announcing
that
it
would
insist
on
a
money
indemnity
neither
in
national
nor
in
private
affairs
is
it
ordinarily
advisable
to
make
a
bluff
which
can
not
be
put
through
personally
i
never
believe
in
doing
it
under
any
circumstances
the
japanese
people
had
been
misled
by
this
bluff
of
their
government
and
the
unwisdom
of
the
government
action
in
the
matter
was
shown
by
the
great
resentment
the
treaty
aroused
in
japan
although
it
was
so
beneficial
to
japan
there
were
various
mob
outbreaks
especially
in
the
japanese
cities
the
police
were
roughly
handled
and
several
christian
churches
were
burned
as
reported
to
me
by
the
american
minister
in
both
russia
and
japan
i
believe
that
the
net
result
as
regards
myself
was
a
feeling
of
injury
and
of
dislike
of
me
among
the
people
at
large
i
had
expected
this
i
regarded
it
as
entirely
natural
and
i
did
not
resent
it
in
the
least
the
governments
of
both
nations
behaved
toward
me
not
only
with
correct
and
entire
propriety
but
with
much
courtesy
and
the
fullest
acknowledgment
of
the
good
effect
of
what
i
had
done
and
in
japan
at
least
i
believe
that
the
leading
men
sincerely
felt
that
i
had
been
their
friend
i
had
certainly
tried
my
best
to
be
the
friend
not
only
of
the
japanese
people
but
of
the
russian
people
and
i
believe
that
what
i
did
was
for
the
best
interests
of
both
and
of
the
world
at
large
during
the
course
of
the
negotiations
i
tried
to
enlist
the
aid
of
the
governments
of
one
nation
which
was
friendly
to
russia
and
of
another
nation
which
was
friendly
to
japan
in
helping
bring
about
peace
i
got
no
aid
from
either
i
did
however
receive
aid
from
the
emperor
of
germany
his
ambassador
at
petersburg
was
the
one
ambassador
who
helped
the
american
ambassador
meyer
at
delicate
and
doubtful
points
of
the
negotiations
meyer
who
was
with
the
exception
of
white
the
most
useful
diplomat
in
the
american
service
rendered
literally
invaluable
aid
by
insisting
upon
himself
seeing
the
czar
at
critical
periods
of
the
transaction
when
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
me
to
act
successfully
through
the
representatives
of
the
czar
who
were
often
at
cross
purposes
with
one
another
as
a
result
of
the
portsmouth
peace
i
was
given
the
nobel
peace
prize
this
consisted
of
a
medal
which
i
kept
and
a
sum
of
which
i
turned
over
as
a
foundation
of
industrial
peace
to
a
board
of
trustees
which
included
oscar
straus
seth
low
and
john
mitchell
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
development
industrial
peace
is
even
more
essential
than
international
peace
and
it
was
fitting
and
appropriate
to
devote
the
peace
prize
to
such
a
purpose
in
while
in
europe
one
of
my
most
pleasant
experiences
was
my
visit
to
norway
where
i
addressed
the
nobel
committee
and
set
forth
in
full
the
principles
upon
which
i
had
acted
not
only
in
this
particular
case
but
throughout
my
administration
i
received
another
gift
which
i
deeply
appreciated
an
original
copy
of
sully
memoires
of
henry
le
grand
sent
me
with
the
following
inscription
i
translate
it
roughly
paris
january
the
undersigned
members
of
the
french
parliamentary
group
of
international
arbitration
and
conciliation
have
decided
to
tender
president
roosevelt
a
token
of
their
high
esteem
and
their
sympathetic
recognition
of
the
persistent
and
decisive
initiative
he
has
taken
towards
gradually
substituting
friendly
and
judicial
for
violent
methods
in
case
of
conflict
between
nations
they
believe
that
the
action
of
president
roosevelt
which
has
realized
the
most
generous
hopes
to
be
found
in
history
should
be
classed
as
a
continuance
of
similar
illustrious
attempts
of
former
times
notably
the
project
for
international
concord
known
under
the
name
of
the
design
of
henry
iv
in
the
memoirs
of
his
prime
minister
the
duke
de
sully
in
consequence
they
have
sought
out
a
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
these
memoirs
and
they
take
pleasure
in
offering
it
to
him
with
the
request
that
he
will
keep
it
among
his
family
papers
the
signatures
include
those
of
emile
loubet
carnot
de
constant
aristide
briand
sully
prudhomme
jean
jaurés
fallieres
poincare
and
two
or
three
hundred
others
of
course
what
i
had
done
in
connection
with
the
portsmouth
peace
was
misunderstood
by
some
good
and
sincere
people
just
as
after
the
settlement
of
the
coal
strike
there
were
persons
who
thereupon
thought
that
it
was
in
my
power
and
was
my
duty
to
settle
all
other
strikes
so
after
the
peace
of
portsmouth
there
were
other
persons
not
only
americans
by
the
way
who
thought
it
my
duty
forthwith
to
make
myself
a
kind
of
international
meddlesome
mattie
and
interfere
for
peace
and
justice
promiscuously
over
the
world
others
with
a
delightful
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
inasmuch
as
i
had
helped
to
bring
about
a
beneficent
and
necessary
peace
i
must
of
necessity
have
changed
my
mind
about
war
being
ever
necessary
a
couple
of
days
after
peace
was
concluded
i
wrote
to
a
friend
do
you
be
misled
by
the
fact
that
just
at
the
moment
men
are
speaking
well
of
me
they
will
speak
ill
soon
enough
as
loeb
remarked
to
me
some
time
soon
i
shall
have
to
spank
some
little
international
brigand
and
then
all
the
idiots
will
turn
and
shriek
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
what
i
did
at
the
peace
conference
whereas
in
reality
it
will
be
exactly
in
line
with
it
to
one
of
my
political
opponents
schurz
who
wrote
me
congratulating
me
upon
the
outcome
at
portsmouth
and
suggesting
that
the
time
was
opportune
for
a
move
towards
disarmament
i
answered
in
a
letter
setting
forth
views
which
i
thought
sound
then
and
think
sound
now
the
letter
ran
as
follows
oyster
bay
september
my
dear
schurz
i
thank
you
for
your
congratulations
as
to
what
you
say
about
disarmament
which
i
suppose
is
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
oppressive
burdens
imposed
upon
the
world
by
armed
peace
i
am
not
clear
either
as
to
what
can
be
done
or
what
ought
to
be
done
if
i
had
been
known
as
one
of
the
conventional
type
of
peace
advocates
i
could
have
done
nothing
whatever
in
bringing
about
peace
now
i
would
be
powerless
in
the
future
to
accomplish
anything
and
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
help
confer
the
boons
upon
cuba
the
philippines
porto
rico
and
panama
brought
about
by
our
action
therein
if
the
japanese
had
not
armed
during
the
last
twenty
years
this
would
indeed
be
a
sorrowful
century
for
japan
if
this
country
had
not
fought
the
spanish
war
if
we
had
failed
to
take
the
action
we
did
about
panama
all
mankind
would
have
been
the
loser
while
the
turks
were
butchering
the
armenians
the
european
powers
kept
the
peace
and
thereby
added
a
burden
of
infamy
to
the
nineteenth
century
for
in
keeping
that
peace
a
greater
number
of
lives
were
lost
than
in
any
european
war
since
the
days
of
napoleon
and
these
lives
were
those
of
women
and
children
as
well
as
of
men
while
the
moral
degradation
the
brutality
inflicted
and
endured
the
aggregate
of
hideous
wrong
done
surpassed
that
of
any
war
of
which
we
have
record
in
modern
times
until
people
get
it
firmly
fixed
in
their
minds
that
peace
is
valuable
chiefly
as
a
means
to
righteousness
and
that
it
can
only
be
considered
as
an
end
when
it
also
coincides
with
righteousness
we
can
do
only
a
limited
amount
to
advance
its
coming
on
this
earth
there
is
of
course
no
analogy
at
present
between
international
law
and
private
or
municipal
law
because
there
is
no
sanction
of
force
for
the
former
while
there
is
for
the
latter
inside
our
own
nation
the
man
does
not
have
to
arm
himself
against
the
lawless
simply
because
there
is
some
armed
force
the
police
the
sheriff
posse
the
national
guard
the
regulars
which
can
be
called
out
to
enforce
the
laws
at
present
there
is
no
similar
international
force
to
call
on
and
i
do
not
as
yet
see
how
it
could
at
present
be
created
hitherto
peace
has
often
come
only
because
some
strong
and
on
the
whole
just
power
has
by
armed
force
or
the
threat
of
armed
force
put
a
stop
to
disorder
in
a
very
interesting
french
book
the
other
day
i
was
reading
how
the
mediterranean
was
freed
from
pirates
only
by
the
pax
britannica
established
by
england
naval
force
the
hopeless
and
hideous
bloodshed
and
wickedness
of
algiers
and
turkestan
was
stopped
and
could
only
be
stopped
when
civilized
nations
in
the
shape
of
russia
and
france
took
possession
of
them
the
same
was
true
of
burma
and
the
malay
states
as
well
as
egypt
with
regard
to
england
peace
has
come
only
as
the
sequel
to
the
armed
interference
of
a
civilized
power
which
relatively
to
its
opponent
was
a
just
and
beneficent
power
if
england
had
disarmed
to
the
point
of
being
unable
to
conquer
the
sudan
and
protect
egypt
so
that
the
mahdists
had
established
their
supremacy
in
northeastern
africa
the
result
would
have
been
a
horrible
and
bloody
calamity
to
mankind
it
was
only
the
growth
of
the
european
powers
in
military
efficiency
that
freed
eastern
europe
from
the
dreadful
scourge
of
the
tartar
and
partially
freed
it
from
the
dreadful
scourge
of
the
turk
unjust
war
is
dreadful
a
just
war
may
be
the
highest
duty
to
have
the
best
nations
the
free
and
civilized
nations
disarm
and
leave
the
despotisms
and
barbarisms
with
great
military
force
would
be
a
calamity
compared
to
which
the
calamities
caused
by
all
the
wars
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
be
trivial
yet
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
we
can
by
international
agreement
state
exactly
which
power
ceases
to
be
free
and
civilized
and
which
comes
near
the
line
of
barbarism
or
despotism
for
example
i
suppose
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
get
russia
and
japan
to
come
to
a
common
agreement
on
this
point
and
there
are
at
least
some
citizens
of
other
nations
not
to
speak
of
their
governments
whom
it
would
also
be
hard
to
get
together
this
does
not
in
the
least
mean
that
it
is
hopeless
to
make
the
effort
it
may
be
that
some
scheme
will
be
developed
america
fortunately
can
cordially
assist
in
such
an
effort
for
no
one
in
his
senses
would
suggest
our
disarmament
and
though
we
should
continue
to
perfect
our
small
navy
and
our
minute
army
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
increase
the
number
of
our
ships
at
any
rate
as
things
look
now
nor
the
number
of
our
soldiers
of
course
our
navy
must
be
kept
up
to
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
and
the
replacing
of
old
and
worthless
vessels
by
new
ones
may
involve
an
increase
in
the
personnel
but
not
enough
to
interfere
with
our
action
along
the
lines
you
have
suggested
but
before
i
would
know
how
to
advocate
such
action
save
in
some
such
way
as
commending
it
to
the
attention
of
the
hague
tribunal
i
would
have
to
have
a
feasible
and
rational
plan
of
action
presented
it
seems
to
me
that
a
general
stop
in
the
increase
of
the
war
navies
of
the
world
be
a
good
thing
but
i
would
not
like
to
speak
too
positively
offhand
of
course
it
is
only
in
continental
europe
that
the
armies
are
too
large
and
before
advocating
action
as
regards
them
i
should
have
to
weigh
matters
carefully
including
by
the
way
such
a
matter
as
the
turkish
army
at
any
rate
nothing
useful
can
be
done
unless
with
the
clear
recognition
that
we
object
to
putting
peace
second
to
righteousness
sincerely
yours
theodore
roosevelt
hon
carl
schurz
bolton
landing

george
y
in
my
own
judgment
the
most
important
service
that
i
rendered
to
peace
was
the
voyage
of
the
battle
fleet
round
the
world
i
had
become
convinced
that
for
many
reasons
it
was
essential
that
we
should
have
it
clearly
understood
by
our
own
people
especially
but
also
by
other
peoples
that
the
pacific
was
as
much
our
home
waters
as
the
atlantic
and
that
our
fleet
could
and
would
at
will
pass
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
great
oceans
it
seemed
to
me
evident
that
such
a
voyage
would
greatly
benefit
the
navy
itself
would
arouse
popular
interest
in
and
enthusiasm
for
the
navy
and
would
make
foreign
nations
accept
as
a
matter
of
course
that
our
fleet
should
from
time
to
time
be
gathered
in
the
pacific
just
as
from
time
to
time
it
was
gathered
in
the
atlantic
and
that
its
presence
in
one
ocean
was
no
more
to
be
accepted
as
a
mark
of
hostility
to
any
asiatic
power
than
its
presence
in
the
atlantic
was
to
be
accepted
as
a
mark
of
hostility
to
any
european
power
i
determined
on
the
move
without
consulting
the
cabinet
precisely
as
i
took
panama
without
consulting
the
cabinet
a
council
of
war
never
fights
and
in
a
crisis
the
duty
of
a
leader
is
to
lead
and
not
to
take
refuge
behind
the
generally
timid
wisdom
of
a
multitude
of
councillors
at
that
time
as
i
happen
to
know
neither
the
english
nor
the
german
authorities
believed
it
possible
to
take
a
fleet
of
great
battleships
round
the
world
they
did
not
believe
that
their
own
fleets
could
perform
the
feat
and
still
less
did
they
believe
that
the
american
fleet
could
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
time
to
have
a
show
down
in
the
matter
because
if
it
was
really
true
that
our
fleet
could
not
get
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
it
was
much
better
to
know
it
and
be
able
to
shape
our
policy
in
view
of
the
knowledge
many
persons
publicly
and
privately
protested
against
the
move
on
the
ground
that
japan
would
accept
it
as
a
threat
to
this
i
answered
nothing
in
public
in
private
i
said
that
i
did
not
believe
japan
would
so
regard
it
because
japan
knew
my
sincere
friendship
and
admiration
for
her
and
realized
that
we
could
not
as
a
nation
have
any
intention
of
attacking
her
and
that
if
there
were
any
such
feeling
on
the
part
of
japan
as
was
alleged
that
very
fact
rendered
it
imperative
that
that
fleet
should
go
when
in
the
spring
of
i
was
in
europe
i
was
interested
to
find
that
high
naval
authorities
in
both
germany
and
italy
had
expected
that
war
would
come
at
the
time
of
the
voyage
they
asked
me
if
i
had
not
been
afraid
of
it
and
if
i
had
not
expected
that
hostilities
would
begin
at
least
by
the
time
that
the
fleet
reached
the
straits
of
magellan
i
answered
that
i
did
not
expect
it
that
i
believed
that
japan
would
feel
as
friendly
in
the
matter
as
we
did
but
that
if
my
expectations
had
proved
mistaken
it
would
have
been
proof
positive
that
we
were
going
to
be
attacked
anyhow
and
that
in
such
event
it
would
have
been
an
enormous
gain
to
have
had
the
three
months
preliminary
preparation
which
enabled
the
fleet
to
start
perfectly
equipped
in
a
personal
interview
before
they
left
i
had
explained
to
the
officers
in
command
that
i
believed
the
trip
would
be
one
of
absolute
peace
but
that
they
were
to
take
exactly
the
same
precautions
against
sudden
attack
of
any
kind
as
if
we
were
at
war
with
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
that
no
excuse
of
any
kind
would
be
accepted
if
there
were
a
sudden
attack
of
any
kind
and
we
were
taken
unawares
my
prime
purpose
was
to
impress
the
american
people
and
this
purpose
was
fully
achieved
the
cruise
did
make
a
very
deep
impression
abroad
boasting
about
what
we
have
done
does
not
impress
foreign
nations
at
all
except
unfavorably
but
positive
achievement
does
and
the
two
american
achievements
that
really
impressed
foreign
peoples
during
the
first
dozen
years
of
this
century
were
the
digging
of
the
panama
canal
and
the
cruise
of
the
battle
fleet
round
the
world
but
the
impression
made
on
our
own
people
was
of
far
greater
consequence
no
single
thing
in
the
history
of
the
new
united
states
navy
has
done
as
much
to
stimulate
popular
interest
and
belief
in
it
as
the
world
cruise
this
effect
was
forecast
in
a
and
friendly
english
periodical
the
london
writing
in
october
a
month
before
the
fleet
sailed
from
hampton
roads
the
all
over
america
the
people
will
follow
the
movements
of
the
fleet
they
will
learn
something
of
the
intricate
details
of
the
coaling
and
commissariat
work
under
warlike
conditions
and
in
a
word
their
attention
will
be
aroused
next
time
roosevelt
or
his
representatives
appeal
to
the
country
for
new
battleships
they
will
do
so
to
people
whose
minds
have
been
influenced
one
way
or
the
other
the
naval
programme
will
not
have
stood
still
we
are
sure
that
apart
from
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
existing
fleet
this
is
the
aim
which
roosevelt
has
in
mind
he
has
a
policy
which
projects
itself
far
into
the
future
but
it
is
an
entire
misreading
of
it
to
suppose
that
it
is
aimed
narrowly
and
definitely
at
any
single
power
i
first
directed
the
fleet
of
sixteen
battleships
to
go
round
through
the
straits
of
magellan
to
san
francisco
from
thence
i
ordered
them
to
new
zealand
and
australia
then
to
the
philippines
china
and
japan
and
home
through
suez
they
stopped
in
the
mediterranean
to
help
the
sufferers
from
the
earthquake
at
messina
by
the
way
and
did
this
work
as
effectively
as
they
had
done
all
their
other
work
admiral
evans
commanded
the
fleet
to
san
francisco
there
admiral
sperry
took
it
admirals
thomas
wainwright
and
schroeder
rendered
distinguished
service
under
evans
and
sperry
the
coaling
and
other
preparations
were
made
in
such
excellent
shape
by
the
department
that
there
was
never
a
hitch
not
so
much
as
the
delay
of
an
hour
in
keeping
every
appointment
made
all
the
repairs
were
made
without
difficulty
the
ship
concerned
merely
falling
out
of
column
for
a
few
hours
and
when
the
job
was
done
steaming
at
speed
until
she
regained
her
position
not
a
ship
was
left
in
any
port
and
there
was
hardly
a
desertion
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
voyage
was
to
be
undertaken
men
crowded
to
enlist
just
as
freely
from
the
mississippi
valley
as
from
the
seaboard
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
spanish
war
the
ships
put
to
sea
overmanned
and
by
as
stalwart
a
set
of
men
as
ever
looked
through
a
porthole
game
for
a
fight
or
a
frolic
but
withal
so
and
with
such
a
sense
of
responsibility
that
in
all
the
ports
in
which
they
landed
their
conduct
was
exemplary
the
fleet
practiced
incessantly
during
the
voyage
both
with
the
guns
and
in
battle
tactics
and
came
home
a
much
more
efficient
fighting
instrument
than
when
it
started
sixteen
months
before
the
best
men
of
command
rank
in
our
own
service
were
confident
that
the
fleet
would
go
round
in
safety
in
spite
of
the
incredulity
of
foreign
critics
even
they
however
did
not
believe
that
it
was
wise
to
send
the
torpedo
craft
around
i
accordingly
acquiesced
in
their
views
as
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
consult
the
lieutenants
but
shortly
before
the
fleet
started
i
went
in
the
government
yacht
mayflower
to
inspect
the
target
practice
off
provincetown
i
was
accompanied
by
two
torpedo
boat
destroyers
in
charge
of
a
couple
of
naval
lieutenants
thorough
gamecocks
and
i
had
the
two
lieutenants
aboard
to
dine
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
the
dinner
they
could
not
refrain
from
asking
if
the
torpedo
flotilla
was
to
go
round
with
the
big
ships
i
told
them
no
that
the
admirals
and
captains
did
not
believe
that
the
torpedo
boats
could
stand
it
and
believed
that
the
officers
and
crews
aboard
the
cockle
shells
would
be
worn
out
by
the
constant
pitching
and
bouncing
and
the
everlasting
need
to
make
repairs
my
two
guests
chorused
an
eager
assurance
that
the
boats
could
stand
it
they
assured
me
that
the
enlisted
men
were
even
more
anxious
to
go
than
were
the
officers
mentioning
that
on
one
of
their
boats
the
terms
of
enlistment
of
most
of
the
crew
were
out
and
the
men
were
waiting
to
see
whether
or
not
to
reenlist
as
they
did
not
care
to
do
so
unless
the
boats
were
to
go
on
the
cruise
i
answered
that
i
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
the
word
of
the
men
who
were
to
do
the
job
and
that
they
should
certainly
go
and
within
half
an
hour
i
sent
out
the
order
for
the
flotilla
to
be
got
ready
it
went
round
in
fine
shape
not
a
boat
being
laid
up
i
felt
that
the
feat
reflected
even
more
credit
upon
the
navy
than
did
the
circumnavigation
of
the
big
ships
and
i
wrote
the
flotilla
commander
the
following
letter
may
my
dear
captain
cone
a
great
deal
of
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
feat
of
our
battleship
fleet
in
encircling
south
america
and
getting
to
san
francisco
and
it
would
be
hard
too
highly
to
compliment
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
that
fleet
for
what
they
have
done
yet
if
i
should
draw
any
distinction
at
all
it
would
be
in
favor
of
you
and
your
associates
who
have
taken
out
the
torpedo
flotilla
yours
was
an
even
more
notable
feat
and
every
officer
and
every
enlisted
man
in
the
torpedo
boat
flotilla
has
the
right
to
feel
that
he
has
rendered
distinguished
service
to
the
united
states
navy
and
therefore
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
i
wish
i
could
thank
each
of
them
personally
will
you
have
this
letter
read
by
the
commanding
officer
of
each
torpedo
boat
to
his
officers
and
crew

there
were
various
amusing
features
connected
with
the
trip
most
of
the
wealthy
people
and
leaders
of
opinion
in
the
eastern
cities
were
at
the
proposal
to
take
the
fleet
away
from
atlantic
waters
the
great
new
york
dailies
issued
frantic
appeals
to
congress
to
stop
the
fleet
from
going
the
head
of
the
senate
committee
on
naval
affairs
announced
that
the
fleet
should
not
and
could
not
go
because
congress
would
refuse
to
appropriate
the
money
he
being
from
an
eastern
seaboard
state
however
i
announced
in
response
that
i
had
enough
money
to
take
the
fleet
around
to
the
pacific
anyhow
that
the
fleet
would
certainly
go
and
that
if
congress
did
not
choose
to
appropriate
enough
money
to
get
the
fleet
back
why
it
would
stay
in
the
pacific
there
was
no
further
difficulty
about
the
money
it
was
not
originally
my
intention
that
the
fleet
should
visit
australia
but
the
australian
government
sent
a
most
cordial
invitation
which
i
gladly
accepted
for
i
have
as
every
american
ought
to
have
a
hearty
admiration
for
and
fellow
feeling
with
australia
and
i
believe
that
america
should
be
ready
to
stand
back
of
australia
in
any
serious
emergency
the
reception
accorded
the
fleet
in
australia
was
wonderful
and
it
showed
the
fundamental
community
of
feeling
between
ourselves
and
the
great
commonwealth
of
the
south
seas
the
considerate
generous
and
hospitality
with
which
the
entire
australian
people
treated
our
officers
and
men
could
not
have
been
surpassed
had
they
been
our
own
countrymen
the
fleet
first
visited
sydney
which
has
a
singularly
beautiful
harbor
the
day
after
the
arrival
one
of
our
captains
noticed
a
member
of
his
crew
trying
to
go
to
sleep
on
a
bench
in
the
park
he
had
fixed
above
his
head
a
large
paper
with
some
lines
evidently
designed
to
forestall
any
questions
from
friendly
hosts
i
am
delighted
with
the
australian
people
i
think
your
harbor
the
finest
in
the
world
i
am
very
tired
and
would
like
to
go
to
sleep
the
most
noteworthy
incident
of
the
cruise
was
the
reception
given
to
our
fleet
in
japan
in
courtesy
and
good
breeding
the
japanese
can
certainly
teach
much
to
the
nations
of
the
western
world
i
had
been
very
sure
that
the
people
of
japan
would
understand
aright
what
the
cruise
meant
and
would
accept
the
visit
of
our
fleet
as
the
signal
honor
which
it
was
meant
to
be
a
proof
of
the
high
regard
and
friendship
i
felt
and
which
i
was
certain
the
american
people
felt
for
the
great
island
empire
the
event
even
surpassed
my
expectations
i
can
not
too
strongly
express
my
appreciation
of
the
generous
courtesy
the
japanese
showed
the
officers
and
crews
of
our
fleet
and
i
may
add
that
every
man
of
them
came
back
a
friend
and
admirer
of
the
japanese
admiral
sperry
wrote
me
a
letter
of
much
interest
dealing
not
only
with
the
reception
in
tokyo
but
with
the
work
of
our
men
at
sea
i
herewith
give
it
almost
in
full
october
dear
roosevelt
my
official
report
of
the
visit
to
japan
goes
forward
in
this
mail
but
there
are
certain
aspects
of
the
affair
so
successfully
concluded
which
can
not
well
be
included
in
the
report
you
are
perhaps
aware
that
denison
of
the
japanese
foreign
office
was
one
of
my
colleagues
at
the
hague
for
whom
i
have
a
very
high
regard
desiring
to
avoid
every
possibility
of
trouble
or
misunderstanding
i
wrote
to
him
last
june
explaining
fully
the
character
of
our
men
which
they
have
so
well
lived
up
to
the
desirability
of
ample
landing
places
guides
rest
houses
and
places
for
changing
money
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
delay
in
getting
the
men
away
from
the
docks
on
the
excursions
in
which
they
delight
very
few
of
them
go
into
a
drinking
place
except
to
get
a
resting
place
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
paying
for
it
by
taking
a
drink
i
also
explained
our
system
of
landing
with
liberty
men
an
unarmed
patrol
properly
officered
to
quietly
take
in
charge
and
send
off
to
their
ships
any
men
who
showed
the
slightest
trace
of
disorderly
conduct
this
letter
he
showed
to
the
minister
of
the
navy
who
highly
approved
of
all
our
arrangements
including
the
patrol
of
which
i
feared
they
might
be
jealous
denison
reply
reached
me
in
manila
with
a
memorandum
from
the
minister
of
the
navy
which
removed
all
doubts
three
temporary
piers
were
built
for
our
boat
landings
each
feet
long
brilliantly
lighted
and
decorated
the
sleeping
accommodations
did
not
permit
two
or
three
thousand
sailors
to
remain
on
shore
but
the
ample
landings
permitted
them
to
be
handled
night
and
day
with
perfect
order
and
safety
at
the
landings
and
railroad
station
in
yokohama
there
were
rest
houses
or
booths
reputable
money
changers
and
as
many
as
a
thousand
japanese
college
students
acted
as
volunteer
guides
besides
japanese
sailors
and
petty
officers
detailed
for
the
purpose
in
tokyo
there
were
a
great
many
excellent
refreshment
places
where
the
men
got
excellent
meals
and
could
rest
smoke
and
write
letters
and
in
none
of
these
places
would
they
allow
the
men
to
pay
anything
though
they
were
more
than
ready
to
do
so
the
arrangements
were
marvelously
perfect
as
soon
as
your
telegram
of
october
giving
the
address
to
be
made
to
the
emperor
was
received
i
gave
copies
of
it
to
our
ambassador
to
be
sent
to
the
foreign
office
it
seems
that
the
emperor
had
already
prepared
a
very
cordial
address
to
be
forwarded
through
me
to
you
after
delivery
at
the
audience
but
your
telegram
reversed
the
situation
and
his
reply
was
prepared
i
am
convinced
that
your
kind
and
courteous
initiative
on
this
occasion
helped
cause
the
pleasant
feeling
which
was
so
obvious
in
the
emperor
bearing
at
the
luncheon
which
followed
the
audience
who
is
reticent
and
conservative
told
me
that
not
only
the
emperor
but
all
the
ministers
were
profoundly
gratified
by
the
course
of
events
i
am
confident
that
not
even
the
most
trifling
incident
has
taken
place
which
could
in
any
way
mar
the
general
satisfaction
and
our
ambassador
has
expressed
to
me
his
great
satisfaction
with
all
that
has
taken
place
owing
to
heavy
weather
encountered
on
the
passage
up
from
manila
the
fleet
was
obliged
to
take
about
tons
of
coal
the
yankton
remained
behind
to
keep
up
communication
for
a
few
days
and
yesterday
she
transmitted
the
emperor
telegram
to
you
which
was
sent
in
reply
to
your
message
through
our
ambassador
after
the
sailing
of
the
fleet
it
must
be
profoundly
gratifying
to
you
to
have
the
mission
on
which
you
sent
the
fleet
terminate
so
happily
and
i
am
profoundly
thankful
that
owing
to
the
confidence
which
you
displayed
in
giving
me
this
command
my
active
career
draws
to
a
close
with
such
honorable
distinction
as
for
the
effect
of
the
cruise
upon
the
training
discipline
and
effectiveness
of
the
fleet
the
good
can
not
be
exaggerated
it
is
a
war
game
in
every
detail
the
wireless
communication
has
been
maintained
with
an
efficiency
hitherto
unheard
of
between
honolulu
and
auckland
miles
we
were
out
of
communication
with
a
cable
station
for
only
one
night
whereas
three
trying
recently
to
maintain
a
chain
of
only
miles
between
auckland
and
sydney
were
only
able
to
do
so
for
a
few
hours
the
officers
and
men
as
soon
as
we
put
to
sea
turn
to
their
gunnery
and
tactical
work
far
more
eagerly
than
they
go
to
functions
every
morning
certain
ships
leave
the
column
and
move
off
seven
or
eight
thousand
yards
as
targets
for
range
measuring
fire
control
and
battery
practice
for
the
others
and
at
night
certain
ships
do
the
same
thing
for
night
battery
practice
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
this
practice
is
unsatisfactory
and
in
some
points
misleading
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
ships
are
painted
white
at
portland
in
i
saw
admiral
barker
white
battleships
under
the
searchlights
of
the
army
at
a
distance
of
yards
seven
sea
miles
without
glasses
while
the
hartford
a
black
ship
was
never
discovered
at
all
though
she
passed
within
a
mile
and
a
half
i
have
for
years
while
a
member
of
the
general
board
advocated
painting
the
ships
war
color
at
all
times
and
by
this
mail
i
am
asking
the
department
to
make
the
necessary
change
in
the
regulations
and
paint
the
ships
properly
i
do
not
know
that
any
one
now
dissents
from
my
view
admiral
wainwright
strongly
concurs
and
the
war
college
conference
recommended
it
year
after
year
without
a
dissenting
voice
in
the
afternoons
the
fleet
has
two
or
three
hours
practice
at
battle
maneuvers
which
excite
as
keen
interest
as
gunnery
exercises
the
competition
in
coal
economy
goes
on
automatically
and
reacts
in
a
hundred
ways
it
has
reduced
the
waste
in
the
use
of
electric
light
and
water
and
certain
chief
engineers
are
said
to
keep
men
ranging
over
the
ships
all
night
turning
out
every
light
not
in
actual
and
immediate
use
perhaps
the
most
important
effect
is
the
keen
hunt
for
defects
in
the
machinery
causing
waste
of
power
the
yankton
by
resetting
valves
increased
her
speed
from
to
knots
on
the
same
expenditure
all
this
has
been
done
but
the
field
is
widening
the
work
has
only
begun
sperry
when
i
left
the
presidency
i
finished
seven
and
a
half
years
of
administration
during
which
not
one
shot
had
been
fired
against
a
foreign
foe
we
were
at
absolute
peace
and
there
was
no
nation
in
the
world
with
whom
a
war
cloud
threatened
no
nation
in
the
world
whom
we
had
wronged
or
from
whom
we
had
anything
to
fear
the
cruise
of
the
battle
fleet
was
not
the
least
of
the
causes
which
ensured
so
peaceful
an
outlook
when
the
fleet
returned
after
its
sixteen
months
voyage
around
the
world
i
went
down
to
hampton
roads
to
greet
it
the
day
was
birthday
february
literally
on
the
minute
the
homing
battlecraft
came
into
view
on
the
flagship
of
the
admiral
i
spoke
to
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
as
follows
admiral
sperry
officers
and
men
of
the
battle
fleet
over
a
year
has
passed
since
you
steamed
out
of
this
harbor
and
over
the
world
rim
and
this
morning
the
hearts
of
all
who
saw
you
thrilled
with
pride
as
the
hulls
of
the
mighty
warships
lifted
above
the
horizon
you
have
been
in
the
northern
and
the
southern
hemispheres
four
times
you
have
crossed
the
line
you
have
steamed
through
all
the
great
oceans
you
have
touched
the
coast
of
every
continent
ever
your
general
course
has
been
westward
and
now
you
come
back
to
the
port
from
which
you
set
sail
this
is
the
first
battle
fleet
that
has
ever
circumnavigated
the
globe
those
who
perform
the
feat
again
can
but
follow
in
your
footsteps
the
little
torpedo
flotilla
went
with
you
around
south
america
through
the
straits
of
magellan
to
our
own
pacific
coast
the
armored
cruiser
squadron
met
you
and
left
you
again
when
you
were
half
way
round
the
world
you
have
falsified
every
prediction
of
the
prophets
of
failure
in
all
your
long
cruise
not
an
accident
worthy
of
mention
has
happened
to
a
single
battleship
nor
yet
to
the
cruisers
or
torpedo
boats
you
left
this
coast
in
a
high
state
of
battle
efficiency
and
you
return
with
your
efficiency
increased
better
prepared
than
when
you
left
not
only
in
personnel
but
even
in
material
during
your
world
cruise
you
have
taken
your
regular
gunnery
practice
and
skilled
though
you
were
before
with
the
guns
you
have
grown
more
skilful
still
and
through
practice
you
have
improved
in
battle
tactics
though
here
there
is
more
room
for
improvement
than
in
your
gunnery
incidentally
i
suppose
i
need
hardly
say
that
one
measure
of
your
fitness
must
be
your
clear
recognition
of
the
need
always
steadily
to
strive
to
render
yourselves
more
fit
if
you
ever
grow
to
think
that
you
are
fit
enough
you
can
make
up
your
minds
that
from
that
moment
you
will
begin
to
go
backward
as
a
the
fleet
comes
back
in
better
shape
than
it
went
out
in
addition
you
the
officers
and
men
of
this
formidable
fighting
force
have
shown
yourselves
the
best
of
all
possible
ambassadors
and
heralds
of
peace
wherever
you
have
landed
you
have
borne
yourselves
so
as
to
make
us
at
home
proud
of
being
your
countrymen
you
have
shown
that
the
best
type
of
fighting
man
of
the
sea
knows
how
to
appear
to
the
utmost
possible
advantage
when
his
business
is
to
behave
himself
on
shore
and
to
make
a
good
impression
in
a
foreign
land
we
are
proud
of
all
the
ships
and
all
the
men
in
this
whole
fleet
and
we
welcome
you
home
to
the
country
whose
good
repute
among
nations
has
been
raised
by
what
you
have
done
appendix
a
the
trusts
the
people
and
the
square
deal
written
when
taft
administration
brought
suit
to
dissolve
the
steel
corporation
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
suit
being
the
acquisition
by
the
corporation
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
this
action
was
taken
with
my
acquiescence
while
i
was
president
and
while
taft
was
a
member
of
my
cabinet
at
the
time
he
never
protested
against
and
as
far
as
i
knew
approved
of
my
action
in
this
case
as
in
the
harvester
trust
case
and
all
similar
cases
the
suit
against
the
steel
trust
by
the
government
has
brought
vividly
before
our
people
the
need
of
reducing
to
order
our
chaotic
government
policy
as
regards
business
as
president
in
messages
to
congress
i
repeatedly
called
the
attention
of
that
body
and
of
the
public
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
law
by
itself
to
meet
business
conditions
and
secure
justice
to
the
people
and
to
the
further
fact
that
it
might
if
left
unsupplemented
by
additional
legislation
work
mischief
with
no
compensating
advantage
and
i
urged
as
strongly
as
i
knew
how
that
the
policy
followed
with
relation
to
railways
in
connection
with
the
commerce
law
should
be
followed
by
the
national
government
as
regards
all
great
business
concerns
and
therefore
that
as
a
first
step
the
powers
of
the
bureau
of
corporations
should
be
greatly
enlarged
or
else
that
there
should
be
created
a
governmental
board
or
commission
with
powers
somewhat
similar
to
those
of
the
commerce
commission
but
covering
the
whole
field
of
business
exclusive
of
transportation
which
should
by
law
be
kept
wholly
separate
from
ordinary
industrial
business
all
common
ownership
of
the
industry
and
the
railway
being
forbidden
in
the
end
i
have
always
believed
that
it
would
also
be
necessary
to
give
the
national
government
complete
power
over
the
organization
and
capitalization
of
all
business
concerns
engaged
in
commerce
a
member
of
my
cabinet
with
whom
even
more
than
with
the
various
i
went
over
every
detail
of
the
trust
situation
was
the
one
time
secretary
of
the
interior
james
garfield
he
writes
me
as
follows
concerning
the
suit
against
the
steel
corporation
nothing
appeared
before
the
house
committee
that
made
me
believe
we
were
deceived
by
judge
gary
this
i
think
is
a
case
that
shows
clearly
the
difference
between
destructive
litigation
and
constructive
legislation
i
have
not
yet
seen
a
full
copy
of
the
government
petition
but
our
papers
give
nothing
that
indicates
any
kind
of
unfair
or
dishonest
competition
such
as
existed
in
both
the
standard
oil
and
tobacco
cases
as
i
understand
it
the
competitors
of
the
steel
company
have
steadily
increased
in
strength
during
the
last
six
or
seven
years
furthermore
the
per
cent
of
the
business
done
by
the
steel
corporation
has
decreased
during
that
time
as
you
will
remember
at
our
first
conference
with
judge
gary
the
judge
stated
that
it
was
the
desire
and
purpose
of
the
company
to
conform
to
what
the
government
wished
it
being
the
purpose
of
the
company
absolutely
to
obey
the
law
both
in
spirit
and
letter
throughout
the
time
that
i
had
charge
of
the
investigation
and
while
we
were
in
washington
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
instance
where
the
steel
company
refused
any
information
requested
but
on
the
contrary
aided
in
every
possible
way
our
investigation
the
position
now
taken
by
the
government
is
absolutely
destructive
of
legitimate
business
because
they
outline
no
rule
of
conduct
for
business
of
any
magnitude
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
the
courts
can
lay
down
such
rules
the
most
the
courts
can
do
is
to
find
as
legal
or
illegal
the
particular
transactions
brought
before
them
hence
after
years
of
tedious
litigation
there
would
be
no
rule
for
future
action
this
method
of
procedure
is
dealing
with
the
device
not
the
result
and
drives
business
to
the
elaboration
of
clever
devices
each
of
which
must
be
tested
in
the
courts
i
have
yet
to
find
a
better
method
of
dealing
with
the
situation
than
that
suggested
by
the
bill
which
we
agreed
upon
in
the
last
days
of
your
administration
that
bill
should
be
used
as
a
basis
for
legislation
and
there
could
be
incorporated
upon
it
whatever
may
be
determined
wise
regarding
the
direct
control
and
supervision
of
the
national
government
either
through
a
commission
similar
to
the
commerce
commission
or
otherwise
before
taking
up
the
matter
in
its
large
aspect
i
wish
to
say
one
word
as
to
one
feature
of
the
government
suit
against
the
steel
corporation
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
suit
is
the
acquisition
by
the
steel
corporation
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
and
it
has
been
alleged
on
the
authority
of
the
government
officials
engaged
in
carrying
on
the
suit
that
as
regards
this
transaction
i
was
misled
by
the
representatives
of
the
steel
corporation
and
that
the
facts
were
not
accurately
or
truthfully
laid
before
me
this
statement
is
not
correct
i
believed
at
the
time
that
the
facts
in
the
case
were
as
represented
to
me
on
behalf
of
the
steel
corporation
and
my
further
knowledge
has
convinced
me
that
this
was
true
i
believed
at
the
time
that
the
representatives
of
the
steel
corporation
told
me
the
truth
as
to
the
change
that
would
be
worked
in
the
percentage
of
the
business
which
the
proposed
acquisition
would
give
the
steel
corporation
and
further
inquiry
has
convinced
me
that
they
did
so
i
was
not
misled
the
representatives
of
the
steel
corporation
told
me
the
truth
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
action
at
that
time
would
be
and
any
statement
that
i
was
misled
or
that
the
representatives
of
the
steel
corporation
did
not
thus
tell
me
the
truth
as
to
the
facts
of
the
case
is
itself
not
in
accordance
with
the
truth
in
of
august
last
i
gave
in
full
the
statement
i
had
made
to
the
investigating
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
on
this
matter
that
statement
is
accurate
and
i
reaffirm
everything
i
therein
said
not
only
as
to
what
occurred
but
also
as
to
my
belief
in
the
wisdom
and
propriety
of
my
action
indeed
the
action
not
merely
was
wise
and
proper
but
it
would
have
been
a
calamity
from
every
standpoint
had
i
failed
to
take
it
on
page
of
the
printed
report
of
the
testimony
before
the
committee
will
be
found
judge
gary
account
of
the
meeting
between
himself
and
frick
and
root
and
myself
this
account
states
the
facts
accurately
it
has
been
alleged
that
the
purchase
by
the
steel
corporation
of
the
property
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
gave
the
steel
corporation
practically
a
monopoly
of
the
southern
iron
ores
that
is
of
the
iron
ores
south
of
the
potomac
and
the
ohio
my
information
which
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
is
accurate
and
not
successfully
to
be
challenged
is
that
of
these
southern
iron
ores
the
steel
corporation
has
including
the
property
gained
from
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
less
than
per
cent
perhaps
not
over
per
cent
this
is
a
very
much
smaller
percentage
than
the
percentage
it
holds
of
the
lake
superior
ores
which
even
after
the
surrender
of
the
hill
lease
will
be
slightly
over
per
cent
according
to
my
view
therefore
and
unless
which
i
do
not
believe
possible
these
figures
can
be
successfully
challenged
the
acquisition
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
ores
in
no
way
changed
the
situation
as
regards
making
the
steel
corporation
a
monopoly
the
showing
as
to
the
percentage
of
production
of
all
kinds
of
steel
ingots
and
steel
castings
in
the
united
states
by
the
steel
corporation
and
by
all
other
manufacturers
respectively
makes
an
even
stronger
case
it
makes
the
case
even
stronger
than
i
put
it
in
my
testimony
before
the
investigating
committee
for
i
was
scrupulously
careful
to
make
statements
that
erred
if
at
all
against
my
own
position
it
appears
from
the
figures
of
production
that
in
the
steel
corporation
had
to
its
credit
nearly
per
cent
of
the
total
production
as
against
a
little
over
per
cent
by
all
other
steel
manufacturers
the
percentage
then
shrank
steadily
until
in
the
year
before
the
acquisition
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
properties
the
percentage
was
a
little
under
per
cent
in
spite
of
the
acquisition
of
these
properties
the
following
year
the
total
percentage
shrank
slightly
and
this
shrinking
has
continued
until
in
the
total
percentage
of
the
steel
corporation
is
but
a
little
over
per
cent
and
the
percentage
by
all
other
steel
manufacturers
but
a
fraction
less
than
per
cent
of
the
per
cent
produced
by
the
steel
corporation
per
cent
is
produced
by
the
former
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
in
other
words
these
figures
show
that
the
acquisition
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
company
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
change
the
situation
and
that
during
the
ten
years
which
include
the
acquisition
of
these
properties
by
the
steel
corporation
the
percentage
of
total
output
of
steel
manufacturers
in
this
country
by
the
steel
corporation
has
shrunk
from
nearly
per
cent
to
but
a
trifle
over
per
cent
i
do
not
believe
that
these
figures
can
be
successfully
controverted
and
if
not
successfully
controverted
they
show
clearly
not
only
that
the
acquisition
of
the
tennessee
coal
and
iron
properties
wrought
no
change
in
the
status
of
the
steel
corporation
but
that
the
steel
corporation
during
the
decade
has
steadily
lost
instead
of
gained
in
monopolistic
character
my
own
belief
is
that
our
nation
should
long
ago
have
adopted
the
policy
of
merely
leasing
for
a
term
of
years
land
but
it
is
the
fault
of
us
ourselves
of
the
people
not
of
the
steel
corporation
that
this
policy
has
not
been
adopted
so
much
for
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
now
for
the
general
subject
when
my
administration
took
office
i
found
not
only
that
there
had
been
little
real
enforcement
of
the
law
and
but
little
more
effective
enforcement
of
the
commerce
law
but
also
that
the
decisions
were
so
chaotic
and
the
laws
themselves
so
vaguely
drawn
or
at
least
interpreted
in
such
widely
varying
fashions
that
the
biggest
business
men
tended
to
treat
both
laws
as
dead
letters
the
series
of
actions
by
which
we
succeeded
in
making
the
commerce
law
an
efficient
and
most
useful
instrument
in
regulating
the
transportation
of
the
country
and
exacting
justice
from
the
big
railways
without
doing
them
injustice
while
indeed
on
the
contrary
securing
them
against
injustice
need
not
here
be
related
the
law
it
was
also
necessary
to
enforce
as
it
had
never
hitherto
been
enforced
both
because
it
was
on
the
and
because
it
was
imperative
to
teach
the
masters
of
the
biggest
corporations
in
the
land
that
they
were
not
and
would
not
be
permitted
to
regard
themselves
as
above
the
law
moreover
where
the
combination
has
really
been
guilty
of
misconduct
the
law
serves
a
useful
purpose
and
in
such
cases
as
those
of
the
standard
oil
and
tobacco
trusts
if
effectively
enforced
the
law
confers
a
real
and
great
good
suits
were
brought
against
the
most
powerful
corporations
in
the
land
which
we
were
convinced
had
clearly
and
beyond
question
violated
the
law
these
suits
were
brought
with
great
care
and
only
where
we
felt
so
sure
of
our
facts
that
we
could
be
fairly
certain
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
success
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
most
of
the
important
suits
we
were
successful
it
was
imperative
that
these
suits
should
be
brought
and
very
real
good
was
achieved
by
bringing
them
for
it
was
only
these
suits
that
made
the
great
masters
of
corporate
capital
in
america
fully
realize
that
they
were
the
servants
and
not
the
masters
of
the
people
that
they
were
subject
to
the
law
and
that
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
be
a
law
unto
themselves
and
the
corporations
against
which
we
proceeded
had
sinned
not
merely
by
being
big
which
we
did
not
regard
as
in
itself
a
sin
but
by
being
guilty
of
unfair
practices
towards
their
competitors
and
by
procuring
fair
advantages
from
the
railways
but
the
resulting
situation
has
made
it
evident
that
the
law
is
not
adequate
to
meet
the
situation
that
has
grown
up
because
of
modern
business
conditions
and
the
accompanying
tremendous
increase
in
the
business
use
of
vast
quantities
of
corporate
wealth
as
i
have
said
this
was
already
evident
to
my
mind
when
i
was
president
and
in
communications
to
congress
i
repeatedly
stated
the
facts
but
when
i
made
these
communications
there
were
still
plenty
of
people
who
did
not
believe
that
we
would
succeed
in
the
suits
that
had
been
instituted
against
the
standard
oil
the
tobacco
and
other
corporations
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
public
as
a
whole
to
realize
what
the
situation
was
sincere
zealots
who
believed
that
all
combinations
could
be
destroyed
and
the
conditions
of
unregulated
competition
restored
insincere
politicians
who
knew
better
but
made
believe
that
they
thought
whatever
their
constituents
wished
them
to
think
crafty
reactionaries
who
wished
to
see
on
the
laws
which
they
believed
unenforceable
and
the
almost
solid
wall
street
crowd
or
representatives
of
big
business
who
at
that
time
opposed
with
equal
violence
both
wise
and
necessary
and
unwise
and
improper
regulation
of
fought
against
the
adoption
of
a
sane
effective
and
policy
it
is
a
vitally
necessary
thing
to
have
the
persons
in
control
of
big
trusts
of
the
character
of
the
standard
oil
trust
and
tobacco
trust
taught
that
they
are
under
the
law
just
as
it
was
a
necessary
thing
to
have
the
sugar
trust
taught
the
same
lesson
in
drastic
fashion
by
henry
stimson
when
he
was
united
states
district
attorney
in
the
city
of
new
york
but
to
attempt
to
meet
the
whole
problem
not
by
administrative
governmental
action
but
by
a
succession
of
lawsuits
is
hopeless
from
the
standpoint
of
working
out
a
permanently
satisfactory
solution
moreover
the
results
sought
to
be
achieved
are
achieved
only
in
extremely
insufficient
and
fragmentary
measure
by
breaking
up
all
big
corporations
whether
they
have
behaved
well
or
ill
into
a
number
of
little
corporations
which
it
is
perfectly
certain
will
be
largely
and
perhaps
altogether
under
the
same
control
such
action
is
harsh
and
mischievous
if
the
corporation
is
guilty
of
nothing
except
its
size
and
where
as
in
the
case
of
the
standard
oil
and
especially
the
tobacco
trusts
the
corporation
has
been
guilty
of
immoral
and
practices
there
is
need
for
far
more
drastic
and
thoroughgoing
action
than
any
that
has
been
taken
under
the
recent
decree
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
the
tobacco
trust
for
instance
the
settlement
in
the
circuit
court
in
which
the
representatives
of
the
government
seem
inclined
to
concur
practically
leaves
all
of
the
companies
still
substantially
under
the
control
of
the
original
defendants
such
a
result
is
lamentable
from
the
standpoint
of
justice
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
if
allowed
to
stand
means
that
the
tobacco
trust
has
merely
been
obliged
to
change
its
clothes
that
none
of
the
real
offenders
have
received
any
real
punishment
while
as
the
new
york
times
a
paper
says
the
tobacco
concerns
in
their
new
clothes
are
in
positions
of
ease
and
luxury
and
immune
from
prosecution
under
the
law
surely
miscarriage
of
justice
is
not
too
strong
a
term
to
apply
to
such
a
result
when
considered
in
connection
with
what
the
supreme
court
said
of
this
trust
that
great
court
in
its
decision
used
language
which
in
spite
of
its
habitual
and
severe
in
stigmatizing
yet
unhesitatingly
condemns
the
tobacco
trust
for
moral
turpitude
saying
that
the
case
shows
an
ever
present
manifestation
of
conscious
by
the
trust
whose
history
is
replete
with
the
doing
of
acts
which
it
was
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
statute
to
forbid
demonstrative
of
the
existence
from
the
beginning
of
a
purpose
to
acquire
dominion
and
control
of
the
tobacco
trade
not
by
the
mere
exertion
of
the
ordinary
right
to
contract
and
to
trade
but
by
methods
devised
in
order
to
monopolize
the
trade
by
driving
competitors
out
of
business
which
were
ruthlessly
carried
out
upon
the
assumption
that
to
work
upon
the
fears
or
play
upon
the
cupidity
of
competitors
would
make
success
possible
the
letters
from
and
to
various
officials
of
the
trust
which
were
put
in
evidence
show
a
literally
astounding
and
horrifying
indulgence
by
the
trust
in
wicked
and
depraved
business
methods
such
as
the
endeavor
to
cause
a
strike
in
their
a
rival
business
firm
factory
or
the
shutting
off
the
market
of
an
independent
tobacco
firm
by
taking
the
necessary
steps
to
give
them
a
warm
reception
or
forcing
importers
into
a
price
agreement
by
causing
and
continuing
a
demoralization
of
the
business
for
such
length
of
time
as
may
be
deemed
desirable
i
quote
from
the
letters
a
trust
guilty
of
such
conduct
should
be
absolutely
disbanded
and
the
only
way
to
prevent
the
repetition
of
such
conduct
is
by
strict
government
supervision
and
not
merely
by
lawsuits
the
law
can
not
meet
the
whole
situation
nor
can
any
modification
of
the
principle
of
the
law
avail
to
meet
the
whole
situation
the
fact
is
that
many
of
the
men
who
have
called
themselves
progressives
and
who
certainly
believe
that
they
are
progressives
represent
in
reality
in
this
matter
not
progress
at
all
but
a
kind
of
sincere
rural
toryism
these
men
believe
that
it
is
possible
by
strengthening
the
law
to
restore
business
to
the
competitive
conditions
of
the
middle
of
the
last
century
any
such
effort
is
foredoomed
to
end
in
failure
and
if
successful
would
be
mischievous
to
the
last
degree
business
can
not
be
successfully
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
practices
and
theories
of
sixty
years
ago
unless
we
abolish
steam
electricity
big
cities
and
in
short
not
only
all
modern
business
and
modern
industrial
conditions
but
all
the
modern
conditions
of
our
civilization
the
effort
to
restore
competition
as
it
was
sixty
years
ago
and
to
trust
for
justice
solely
to
this
proposed
restoration
of
competition
is
just
as
foolish
as
if
we
should
go
back
to
the
flintlocks
of
washington
continentals
as
a
substitute
for
modern
weapons
of
precision
the
effort
to
prohibit
all
combinations
good
or
bad
is
bound
to
fail
and
ought
to
fail
when
made
it
merely
means
that
some
of
the
worst
combinations
are
not
checked
and
that
honest
business
is
checked
our
purpose
should
be
not
to
strangle
business
as
an
incident
of
strangling
combinations
but
to
regulate
big
corporations
in
thoroughgoing
and
effective
fashion
so
as
to
help
legitimate
business
as
an
incident
to
thoroughly
and
completely
safeguarding
the
interests
of
the
people
as
a
whole
against
all
such
increase
of
government
regulation
the
argument
is
raised
that
it
would
amount
to
a
form
of
socialism
this
argument
is
familiar
it
is
precisely
the
same
as
that
which
was
raised
against
the
creation
of
the
commerce
commission
and
of
all
the
different
utilities
commissions
in
the
different
states
as
i
myself
saw
thirty
years
ago
when
i
was
a
legislator
at
albany
and
these
questions
came
up
in
connection
with
our
state
government
nor
can
action
be
effectively
taken
by
any
one
state
congress
alone
has
power
under
the
constitution
effectively
and
thoroughly
and
at
all
points
to
deal
with
commerce
and
where
congress
as
it
should
do
provides
laws
that
will
give
the
nation
full
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
field
then
that
jurisdiction
becomes
of
necessity
exclusive
although
until
congress
does
act
affirmatively
and
thoroughly
it
is
idle
to
expect
that
the
states
will
or
ought
to
rest
content
with
on
the
part
of
both
federal
and
state
authorities
this
statement
by
the
way
applies
also
to
the
question
of
usurpation
by
any
one
branch
of
our
government
of
the
rights
of
another
branch
it
is
contended
that
in
these
recent
decisions
the
supreme
court
legislated
so
it
did
and
it
had
to
because
congress
had
signally
failed
to
do
its
duty
by
legislating
for
the
supreme
court
to
nullify
an
act
of
the
legislature
as
unconstitutional
except
on
the
clearest
grounds
is
usurpation
to
interpret
such
an
act
in
an
obviously
wrong
sense
is
usurpation
but
where
the
legislative
body
persistently
leaves
open
a
field
which
it
is
absolutely
imperative
from
the
public
standpoint
to
fill
then
no
possible
blame
attaches
to
the
official
or
officials
who
step
in
because
they
have
to
and
who
then
do
the
needed
work
in
the
interest
of
the
people
the
blame
in
such
cases
lies
with
the
body
which
has
been
derelict
and
not
with
the
body
which
reluctantly
makes
good
the
dereliction
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
senator

the

of
the
sternest
adherence
to
the
principles
laid
down
by
an
exacting
sense
of
duty
an
unflinching
believer
in

who

a

delivered
at

of

spoke
as

their
power

cynical
contempt
for

their
sorcery

we
look
into
the
origin
of
feudalism
and
of
the
modern
corporations
those
dromios
of
history
we
find
that
the
former
originated
in
a
strict
paternalism
which
is
scouted
by
modern
economists
and
that
the
latter
has
grown
from
an
unrestrained
freedom
of
action
aggression
and
development
which
they
commend
as
the
very
ideal
of

wisdom
says
the
professor
when
it
often
means
bind
and
gag
that
the
strongest
may
work
his
will
it
is
a
plea
for
the
survival
of
the
fittest
for
the
strongest
male
to
take
possession
of
the
herd
by
a
process
of
extermination
if
we
examine
this
battle
cry
of
political
polemics
we
find
that
it
is
based
upon
the
conception
of
the
divine
right
of
property
and
the
preoccupation
by
older
or
more
favored
or
more
alert
or
richer
men
or
nations
of
territory
of
the
forces
of
nature
of
machinery
of
all
the
functions
of
what
we
call
civilization
some
of
these
men
who
are
really
great
follow
these
conceptions
to
their
conclusions
with
dauntless
intrepidity
when
senator
davis
spoke
few
men
of
great
power
had
the
sympathy
and
the
vision
necessary
to
perceive
the
menace
contained
in
the
growth
of
corporations
and
the
men
who
did
see
the
evil
were
struggling
blindly
to
get
rid
of
it
not
by
frankly
meeting
the
new
situation
with
new
methods
but
by
insisting
upon
the
entirely
futile
effort
to
abolish
what
modern
conditions
had
rendered
absolutely
inevitable
senator
davis
was
under
no
such
illusion
he
realized
keenly
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
go
back
to
an
outworn
social
status
and
that
we
must
abandon
definitely
the
theory
of
political
economy
and
fearlessly
champion
a
system
of
increased
governmental
control
paying
no
heed
to
the
cries
of
the
worthy
people
who
denounce
this
as
socialistic
he
saw
that
in
order
to
meet
the
inevitable
increase
in
the
power
of
corporations
produced
by
modern
industrial
conditions
it
would
be
necessary
to
increase
in
like
fashion
the
activity
of
the
sovereign
power
which
alone
could
control
such
corporations
as
has
been
aptly
said
the
only
way
to
meet
a
corporation
is
by
invoking
the
protection
of
a
government
in
other
words
of
the
national
government
for
no
state
government
is
strong
enough
both
to
do
justice
to
corporations
and
to
exact
justice
from
them
said
senator
davis
in
this
admirable
address
which
should
be
reprinted
and
distributed
broadcast
the
liberty
of
the
individual
has
been
annihilated
by
the
logical
process
constructed
to
maintain
it
we
have
come
to
a
political
deification
of
mammon
is
not
utterly
blameworthy
it
begat
modern
democracy
and
made
the
modern
republic
possible
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
but
there
it
reached
its
limit
of
political
benefaction
and
began
to
incline
toward
the
point
where
extremes
meet
to
every
assertion
that
the
people
in
their
collective
capacity
of
a
government
ought
to
exert
their
indefeasible
right
of
it
is
said
you
touch
the
sacred
rights
of
property
the
senator
then
goes
on
to
say
that
we
now
have
to
deal
with
an
oligarchy
of
wealth
and
that
the
government
must
develop
power
sufficient
enough
to
enable
it
to
do
the
task
few
will
dispute
the
fact
that
the
present
situation
is
not
satisfactory
and
can
not
be
put
on
a
permanently
satisfactory
basis
unless
we
put
an
end
to
the
period
of
groping
and
declare
for
a
fixed
policy
a
policy
which
shall
clearly
define
and
punish
which
shall
put
a
stop
to
the
iniquities
done
in
the
name
of
business
but
which
shall
do
strict
equity
to
business
we
demand
that
big
business
give
the
people
a
square
deal
in
return
we
must
insist
that
when
any
one
engaged
in
big
business
honestly
endeavors
to
do
right
he
shall
himself
be
given
a
square
deal
and
the
first
and
most
elementary
kind
of
square
deal
is
to
give
him
in
advance
full
information
as
to
just
what
he
can
and
what
he
can
not
legally
and
properly
do
it
is
absurd
and
much
worse
than
absurd
to
treat
the
deliberate
lawbreaker
as
on
an
exact
par
with
the
man
eager
to
obey
the
law
whose
only
desire
is
to
find
out
from
some
competent
governmental
authority
what
the
law
is
and
then
to
live
up
to
it
moreover
it
is
absurd
to
treat
the
size
of
a
corporation
as
in
itself
a
crime
as
judge
hook
says
in
his
opinion
in
the
standard
oil
case
magnitude
of
business
does
not
alone
constitute
a
monopoly
the
genius
and
industry
of
man
when
kept
to
ethical
standards
still
have
full
play
and
what
he
achieves
is
his
success
and
magnitude
of
business
the
rewards
of
fair
and
honorable
endeavor
are
not
forbidden
the
public
welfare
is
threatened
only
when
success
is
attained
by
wrongful
or
unlawful
methods
size
may
and
in
my
opinion
does
make
a
corporation
fraught
with
potential
menace
to
the
community
and
may
and
in
my
opinion
should
therefore
make
it
incumbent
upon
the
community
to
exercise
through
its
administrative
not
merely
through
its
judicial
officers
a
strict
supervision
over
that
corporation
in
order
to
see
that
it
does
not
go
wrong
but
the
size
in
itself
does
not
signify
and
should
not
be
held
to
signify
not
only
should
any
huge
corporation
which
has
gained
its
position
by
unfair
methods
and
by
interference
with
the
rights
of
others
by
demoralizing
and
corrupt
practices
in
short
by
sheer
baseness
and
be
broken
up
but
it
should
be
made
the
business
of
some
administrative
governmental
body
by
constant
supervision
to
see
that
it
does
not
come
together
again
save
under
such
strict
control
as
shall
insure
the
community
against
all
repetition
of
the
bad
conduct
and
it
should
never
be
permitted
thus
to
assemble
its
parts
as
long
as
these
parts
are
under
the
control
of
the
original
offenders
for
actual
experience
has
shown
that
these
men
are
from
the
standpoint
of
the
people
at
large
unfit
to
be
trusted
with
the
power
implied
in
the
management
of
a
large
corporation
but
nothing
of
importance
is
gained
by
breaking
up
a
huge
and
international
industrial
organization
has
not
offended
otherwise
than
by
its
into
a
number
of
small
concerns
without
any
attempt
to
regulate
the
way
in
which
those
concerns
as
a
whole
shall
do
business
nothing
is
gained
by
depriving
the
american
nation
of
good
weapons
wherewith
to
fight
in
the
great
field
of
international
industrial
competition
those
who
would
seek
to
restore
the
days
of
unlimited
and
uncontrolled
competition
and
who
believe
that
a
panacea
for
our
industrial
and
economic
ills
is
to
be
found
in
the
mere
breaking
up
of
all
big
corporations
simply
because
they
are
big
are
attempting
not
only
the
impossible
but
what
if
possible
would
be
undesirable
they
are
acting
as
we
should
act
if
we
tried
to
dam
the
mississippi
to
stop
its
flow
outright
the
effort
would
be
certain
to
result
in
failure
and
disaster
we
would
have
attempted
the
impossible
and
so
would
have
achieved
nothing
or
worse
than
nothing
but
by
building
levees
along
the
mississippi
not
seeking
to
dam
the
stream
but
to
control
it
we
are
able
to
achieve
our
object
and
to
confer
inestimable
good
in
the
course
of
so
doing
this
nation
should
definitely
adopt
the
policy
of
attacking
not
the
mere
fact
of
combination
but
the
evils
and
which
so
frequently
accompany
combination
the
fact
that
a
combination
is
very
big
is
ample
reason
for
exercising
a
close
and
jealous
supervision
over
it
because
its
size
renders
it
potent
for
mischief
but
it
should
not
be
punished
unless
it
actually
does
the
mischief
it
should
merely
be
so
supervised
and
controlled
as
to
guarantee
us
the
people
against
its
doing
mischief
we
should
not
strive
for
a
policy
of
unregulated
competition
and
of
the
destruction
of
all
big
corporations
that
is
of
all
the
most
efficient
business
industries
in
the
land
nor
should
we
persevere
in
the
hopeless
experiment
of
trying
to
regulate
these
industries
by
means
only
of
lawsuits
each
lasting
several
years
and
of
uncertain
result
we
should
enter
upon
a
course
of
supervision
control
and
regulation
of
these
great
corporations
a
regulation
which
we
should
not
fear
if
necessary
to
bring
to
the
point
of
control
of
monopoly
prices
just
as
in
exceptional
cases
railway
rates
are
now
regulated
either
the
bureau
of
corporations
should
be
authorized
or
some
other
governmental
body
similar
to
the
commerce
commission
should
be
created
to
exercise
this
supervision
this
authoritative
control
when
once
immoral
business
practices
have
been
eliminated
by
such
control
competition
will
thereby
be
again
revived
as
a
healthy
factor
although
not
as
formerly
an
factor
in
keeping
the
general
business
situation
sound
wherever
immoral
business
practices
still
obtain
as
they
obtained
in
the
cases
of
the
standard
oil
trust
and
tobacco
trust
the
law
can
be
invoked
and
wherever
such
a
prosecution
is
successful
and
the
courts
declare
a
corporation
to
possess
a
monopolistic
character
then
that
corporation
should
be
completely
dissolved
and
the
parts
ought
never
to
be
again
assembled
save
on
whatever
terms
and
under
whatever
conditions
may
be
imposed
by
the
governmental
body
in
which
is
vested
the
regulatory
power
methods
can
readily
be
devised
by
which
corporations
sincerely
desiring
to
act
fairly
and
honestly
can
on
their
own
initiative
come
under
this
thoroughgoing
administrative
control
by
the
government
and
thereby
be
free
from
the
working
of
the
law
but
the
law
will
remain
to
be
invoked
against
wrongdoers
and
under
such
conditions
it
could
be
invoked
far
more
vigorously
and
successfully
than
at
present
it
is
not
necessary
in
an
article
like
this
to
attempt
to
work
out
such
a
plan
in
detail
it
can
assuredly
be
worked
out
moreover
in
my
opinion
substantially
some
such
plan
must
be
worked
out
or
business
chaos
will
continue
wrongdoing
such
as
was
perpetrated
by
the
standard
oil
trust
and
especially
by
the
tobacco
trust
should
not
only
be
punished
but
if
possible
punished
in
the
persons
of
the
chief
authors
and
beneficiaries
of
the
wrong
far
more
severely
than
at
present
but
punishment
should
not
be
the
only
or
indeed
the
main
end
in
view
our
aim
should
be
a
policy
of
construction
and
not
one
of
destruction
our
aim
should
not
be
to
punish
the
men
who
have
made
a
big
corporation
successful
merely
because
they
have
made
it
big
and
successful
but
to
exercise
such
thoroughgoing
supervision
and
control
over
them
as
to
insure
their
business
skill
being
exercised
in
the
interest
of
the
public
and
not
against
the
public
interest
ultimately
i
believe
that
this
control
should
undoubtedly
indirectly
or
directly
extend
to
dealing
with
all
questions
connected
with
their
treatment
of
their
employees
including
the
wages
the
hours
of
labor
and
the
like
not
only
is
the
proper
treatment
of
a
corporation
from
the
standpoint
of
the
managers
shareholders
and
employees
compatible
with
securing
from
that
corporation
the
best
standard
of
public
service
but
when
the
effort
is
wisely
made
it
results
in
benefit
both
to
the
corporation
and
to
the
public
the
success
of
wisconsin
in
dealing
with
the
corporations
within
her
borders
so
as
both
to
do
them
justice
and
to
exact
justice
in
return
from
them
toward
the
public
has
been
signal
and
this
nation
should
adopt
a
progressive
policy
in
substance
akin
to
the
progressive
policy
not
merely
formulated
in
theory
but
reduced
to
actual
practice
with
such
striking
success
in
wisconsin
to
sum
up
then
it
is
practically
impossible
and
if
possible
it
would
be
mischievous
and
undesirable
to
try
to
break
up
all
combinations
merely
because
they
are
large
and
successful
and
to
put
the
business
of
the
country
back
into
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
conditions
of
intense
and
unregulated
competition
between
small
and
weak
business
concerns
such
an
effort
represents
not
progressiveness
but
an
unintelligent
though
doubtless
entirely
toryism
moreover
the
effort
to
administer
a
law
merely
by
lawsuits
and
court
decisions
is
bound
to
end
in
signal
failure
and
meanwhile
to
be
attended
with
delays
and
uncertainties
and
to
put
a
premium
upon
legal
sharp
practice
such
an
effort
does
not
adequately
punish
the
guilty
and
yet
works
great
harm
to
the
innocent
moreover
it
entirely
fails
to
give
the
publicity
which
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
system
of
control
by
administrative
officials
publicity
which
is
not
only
good
in
itself
but
furnishes
the
data
for
whatever
further
action
may
be
necessary
we
need
to
formulate
immediately
and
definitely
a
policy
which
in
dealing
with
big
corporations
that
behave
themselves
and
which
contain
no
menace
save
what
is
necessarily
potential
in
any
corporation
which
is
of
great
size
and
very
well
managed
shall
aim
not
at
their
destruction
but
at
their
regulation
and
supervision
so
that
the
government
shall
control
them
in
such
fashion
as
amply
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
the
whole
public
including
producers
consumers
and
this
control
should
if
necessary
be
pushed
in
extreme
cases
to
the
point
of
exercising
control
over
monopoly
prices
as
rates
on
railways
are
now
controlled
although
this
is
not
a
power
that
should
be
used
when
it
is
possible
to
avoid
it
the
law
should
be
clear
unambiguous
certain
so
that
honest
men
may
not
find
that
unwittingly
they
have
violated
it
in
short
our
aim
should
be
not
to
destroy
but
effectively
and
in
thoroughgoing
fashion
to
regulate
and
control
in
the
public
interest
the
great
instrumentalities
of
modern
business
which
it
is
destructive
of
the
general
welfare
of
the
community
to
destroy
and
which
nevertheless
it
is
vitally
necessary
to
that
general
welfare
to
regulate
and
control
competition
will
remain
as
a
very
important
factor
when
once
we
have
destroyed
the
unfair
business
methods
the
criminal
interference
with
the
rights
of
others
which
alone
enabled
certain
swollen
combinations
to
crush
out
their
competitors
and
incidentally
the
conservatives
will
do
well
to
remember
that
these
unfair
and
iniquitous
methods
by
great
masters
of
corporate
capital
have
done
more
to
cause
popular
discontent
with
the
propertied
classes
than
all
the
orations
of
all
the
socialist
orators
in
the
country
put
together
i
have
spoken
above
of
senator
davis
admirable
address
delivered
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
senator
davis
partner
frank
kellogg
the
government
counsel
who
did
so
much
to
win
success
for
the
government
in
its
prosecutions
of
the
trusts
has
recently
delivered
before
the
palimpsest
club
of
omaha
an
excellent
address
on
the
subject
prouty
of
the
commerce
commission
has
recently
in
his
speech
before
the
congregational
club
of
brooklyn
dealt
with
the
subject
from
the
constructive
side
and
in
the
proceedings
of
the
american
bar
association
for
there
is
an
admirable
paper
on
the
need
of
thoroughgoing
federal
control
over
corporations
doing
an
business
by
professor
horace
wilgus
of
the
university
of
michigan
the
national
government
exercises
control
over
commerce
railways
and
it
can
in
similar
fashion
through
an
appropriate
governmental
body
exercise
control
over
all
industrial
organizations
engaged
in
commerce
this
control
should
be
exercised
not
by
the
courts
but
by
an
administrative
bureau
or
board
such
as
the
bureau
of
corporations
or
the
commerce
commission
for
the
courts
can
not
with
advantage
permanently
perform
executive
and
administrative
functions
appendix
b
the
control
of
corporations
and
the
new
freedom
in
his
book
the
new
freedom
and
in
the
magazine
articles
of
which
it
is
composed
which
appeared
just
after
he
had
been
inaugurated
as
president
woodrow
wilson
made
an
entirely
unprovoked
attack
upon
me
and
upon
the
progressive
party
in
connection
with
what
he
asserts
the
policy
of
that
party
to
be
concerning
the
trusts
and
as
regards
my
attitude
while
president
about
the
trusts
i
am
reluctant
to
say
anything
whatever
about
president
wilson
at
the
outset
of
his
administration
unless
i
can
speak
of
him
with
praise
i
have
scrupulously
refrained
from
saying
or
doing
one
thing
since
election
that
could
put
the
slightest
obstacle
even
of
misinterpretation
in
his
path
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
country
that
he
should
succeed
in
his
office
i
cordially
wish
him
success
and
i
shall
cordially
support
any
policy
of
his
that
i
believe
to
be
in
the
interests
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
but
when
wilson
after
being
elected
president
within
the
first
fortnight
after
he
has
been
inaugurated
into
that
high
office
permits
himself
to
be
betrayed
into
a
public
misstatement
of
what
i
have
said
and
what
i
stand
for
then
he
forces
me
to
correct
his
statements
wilson
opens
his
article
by
saying
that
the
progressive
doctrine
is
that
monopoly
is
inevitable
and
that
the
only
course
open
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
is
to
submit
to
it
this
statement
is
without
one
particle
of
foundation
in
fact
i
challenge
him
to
point
out
a
sentence
in
the
progressive
platform
or
in
any
speech
of
mine
which
bears
him
out
i
can
point
him
out
any
number
which
flatly
contradict
him
we
have
never
made
any
such
statement
as
he
alleges
about
monopolies
we
have
said
the
corporation
is
an
essential
part
of
modern
business
the
concentration
of
modern
business
in
some
degree
is
both
inevitable
and
necessary
for
national
and
international
business
efficiency
does
wilson
deny
this
let
him
answer
yes
or
no
directly
it
is
easy
for
a
politician
detected
in
a
misstatement
to
take
refuge
in
evasive
rhetorical
hyperbole
but
wilson
is
president
of
the
united
states
and
as
such
he
is
bound
to
candid
utterance
on
every
subject
of
public
interest
which
he
himself
has
broached
if
he
disagrees
with
us
let
him
be
frank
and
consistent
and
recommend
to
congress
that
all
corporations
be
made
illegal
wilson
whole
attack
is
largely
based
on
a
deft
but
far
from
ingenuous
confounding
of
what
we
have
said
of
monopoly
which
we
propose
so
far
as
possible
to
abolish
and
what
we
have
said
of
big
corporations
which
we
propose
to
regulate
wilson
own
vaguely
set
forth
proposals
being
to
attempt
the
destruction
of
both
in
ways
that
would
harm
neither
in
our
platform
we
use
the
word
monopoly
but
once
and
then
we
speak
of
it
as
an
abuse
of
power
coupling
it
with
unfair
competition
and
unfair
privileges
does
wilson
deny
this
if
he
does
then
where
else
will
he
assert
that
we
speak
of
monopoly
as
he
says
we
do
he
certainly
owes
the
people
of
the
united
states
a
plain
answer
to
the
question
in
my
speech
of
acceptance
i
said
we
favor
strengthening
the
sherman
law
by
prohibiting
agreements
to
divide
territory
or
limit
output
refusing
to
sell
to
customers
who
buy
from
business
rivals
to
sell
below
cost
in
certain
areas
while
maintaining
higher
prices
in
other
places
using
the
power
of
transportation
to
aid
or
injure
special
business
concerns
and
all
other
unfair
trade
practices
the
platform
pledges
us
to
guard
and
keep
open
equally
to
all
the
highways
of
american
commerce
this
is
the
exact
negation
of
monopoly
unless
wilson
is
prepared
to
show
the
contrary
surely
he
is
bound
in
honor
to
admit
frankly
that
he
has
been
betrayed
into
a
misrepresentation
and
to
correct
it
wilson
says
that
for
sixteen
years
the
national
administration
has
been
virtually
under
the
regulation
of
the
trusts
and
that
the
big
business
men
have
already
captured
the
government
such
a
statement
as
this
might
perhaps
be
pardoned
as
mere
rhetoric
in
a
candidate
seeking
office
although
it
is
the
kind
of
statement
that
never
under
any
circumstances
have
i
permitted
myself
to
make
whether
on
the
stump
or
off
the
stump
about
any
opponent
unless
i
was
prepared
to
back
it
up
with
explicit
facts
but
there
is
an
added
seriousness
to
the
charge
when
it
is
made
deliberately
and
in
cold
blood
by
a
man
who
is
at
the
time
president
in
this
volume
i
have
set
forth
my
relations
with
the
trusts
i
challenge
wilson
to
controvert
anything
i
have
said
or
to
name
any
trusts
or
any
big
business
men
who
regulated
or
in
any
shape
or
way
controlled
or
captured
the
government
during
my
term
as
president
he
must
furnish
specifications
if
his
words
are
taken
at
their
face
value
and
i
venture
to
say
in
advance
that
the
absurdity
of
such
a
charge
is
patent
to
all
my
not
excepting
wilson
wilson
says
that
the
new
party
was
founded
under
the
leadership
of
roosevelt
with
the
conspicuous
aid
i
mention
him
with
no
satirical
intention
but
merely
to
set
the
facts
down
accurately
of
george
perkins
organizer
of
the
steel
trust
whether
wilson
intention
was
satirical
or
not
is
of
no
concern
but
i
call
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
has
conspicuously
and
strikingly
failed
to
set
the
facts
down
accurately
perkins
was
not
the
organizer
of
the
steel
trust
and
when
it
was
organized
he
had
no
connection
with
it
or
with
the
morgan
people
this
is
well
known
and
it
has
again
and
again
been
testified
to
before
congressional
committees
controlled
by
friends
who
were
endeavoring
to
find
out
something
against
perkins
if
wilson
does
not
know
that
my
statement
is
correct
he
ought
to
know
it
and
he
is
not
to
be
excused
for
making
such
a
misstatement
as
he
has
made
when
he
has
not
a
particle
of
evidence
in
support
of
it
perkins
was
from
the
beginning
in
the
harvester
trust
but
when
wilson
points
out
this
fact
why
does
he
not
add
that
he
was
the
only
man
in
that
trust
who
supported
me
and
that
the
president
of
the
trust
ardently
supported
wilson
himself
it
is
disingenuous
to
endeavor
to
conceal
these
facts
and
to
mislead
ordinary
citizens
about
them
under
the
administrations
of
both
taft
and
wilson
perkins
has
been
singled
out
for
special
attack
obviously
not
because
he
belonged
to
the
harvester
and
steel
trusts
but
because
he
alone
among
the
prominent
men
of
the
two
corporations
fearlessly
supported
the
only
party
which
afforded
any
real
hope
of
checking
the
evil
of
the
trusts
wilson
states
that
the
progressives
have
a
programme
perfectly
agreeable
to
monopolies
the
plain
and
unmistakable
inference
to
be
drawn
from
this
and
other
similar
statements
in
his
article
and
the
inference
which
he
obviously
desired
to
have
drawn
is
that
the
big
corporations
approved
the
progressive
plan
and
supported
the
progressive
candidate
if
president
wilson
does
not
know
perfectly
well
that
this
is
not
the
case
he
is
the
only
intelligent
person
in
the
united
states
who
is
thus
ignorant
everybody
knows
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
heads
of
the
big
corporations
supported
him
or
taft
it
is
equally
well
known
that
of
the
corporations
he
mentions
the
steel
and
the
harvester
trusts
there
was
but
one
man
who
took
any
part
in
the
progressive
campaign
and
that
almost
all
the
others
some
thirty
in
number
were
against
us
and
some
of
them
including
the
president
of
the
harvester
trust
openly
and
enthusiastically
for
wilson
himself
if
he
reads
the
newspapers
at
all
he
must
know
that
practically
every
man
representing
the
great
financial
interests
of
the
country
and
without
exception
every
newspaper
controlled
by
wall
street
or
state
street
actively
supported
either
him
or
taft
and
showed
perfect
willingness
to
accept
either
if
only
they
could
prevent
the
progressive
party
from
coming
into
power
and
from
putting
its
platform
into
effect
wilson
says
of
the
trust
plank
in
that
platform
that
it
did
not
anywhere
condemn
monopoly
except
in
words
exactly
of
what
else
could
a
platform
consist
does
wilson
expect
us
to
use
algebraic
signs
this
criticism
is
much
as
if
he
said
the
constitution
or
the
declaration
of
independence
contained
nothing
but
words
the
progressive
platform
did
contain
words
and
the
words
were
admirably
designed
to
express
thought
and
meaning
and
purpose
wilson
says
that
i
long
ago
classified
trusts
for
us
as
good
and
bad
and
said
that
i
was
afraid
only
of
the
bad
ones
wilson
would
do
well
to
quote
exactly
what
my
language
was
and
where
it
was
used
for
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
statement
of
mine
it
is
to
which
he
refers
but
if
he
means
that
i
say
that
corporations
can
do
well
and
that
corporations
can
also
do
ill
he
is
stating
my
position
correctly
i
hold
that
a
corporation
does
ill
if
it
seeks
profit
in
restricting
production
and
then
by
extorting
high
prices
from
the
community
by
reason
of
the
scarcity
of
the
product
through
adulterating
lyingly
advertising
or
the
help
or
replacing
men
workers
with
children
or
by
rebates
or
in
any
illegal
or
improper
manner
driving
competitors
out
of
its
way
or
seeking
to
achieve
monopoly
by
illegal
or
unethical
treatment
of
its
competitors
or
in
any
shape
or
way
offending
against
the
moral
law
either
in
connection
with
the
public
or
with
its
employees
or
with
its
rivals
any
corporation
which
seeks
its
profit
in
such
fashion
is
acting
badly
it
is
in
fact
a
conspiracy
against
the
public
welfare
which
the
government
should
use
all
its
powers
to
suppress
if
on
the
other
hand
a
corporation
seeks
profit
solely
by
increasing
its
products
through
eliminating
waste
improving
its
processes
utilizing
its
installing
better
machines
raising
wages
in
the
effort
to
secure
more
efficient
help
introducing
the
principle
of
cooperation
and
mutual
benefit
dealing
fairly
with
labor
unions
setting
its
face
against
the
underpayment
of
women
and
the
employment
of
children
in
a
word
treating
the
public
fairly
and
its
rivals
fairly
then
such
a
corporation
is
behaving
well
it
is
an
instrumentality
of
civilization
operating
to
promote
abundance
by
cheapening
the
cost
of
living
so
as
to
improve
conditions
everywhere
throughout
the
whole
community
does
wilson
controvert
either
of
these
statements
if
so
let
him
answer
directly
it
is
a
matter
of
capital
importance
to
the
country
that
his
position
in
this
respect
be
stated
directly
not
by
indirect
suggestion
much
of
wilson
article
although
apparently
aimed
at
the
progressive
party
is
both
so
rhetorical
and
so
vague
as
to
need
no
answer
he
does
however
specifically
assert
among
other
things
equally
without
warrant
in
fact
that
the
progressive
party
says
that
it
is
futile
to
undertake
to
prevent
monopoly
and
only
ventures
to
ask
the
trusts
to
be
kind
and
pitiful
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
answer
a
misrepresentation
of
the
facts
so
radical
not
to
say
preposterous
with
the
respect
that
one
desires
to
use
in
speaking
of
or
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
challenge
president
wilson
to
point
to
one
sentence
of
our
platform
or
of
my
speeches
which
affords
the
faintest
justification
for
these
assertions
having
made
this
statement
in
the
course
of
an
unprovoked
attack
on
me
he
can
not
refuse
to
show
that
it
is
true
i
deem
it
necessary
to
emphasize
here
but
with
perfect
respect
that
i
am
asking
for
a
plain
statement
of
fact
not
for
a
display
of
rhetoric
i
ask
him
as
is
my
right
under
the
circumstances
to
quote
the
exact
language
which
justifies
him
in
attributing
these
views
to
us
if
he
can
not
do
this
then
a
frank
acknowledgment
on
his
part
is
due
to
himself
and
to
the
people
i
quote
from
the
progressive
platform
behind
the
ostensible
government
sits
enthroned
an
invisible
government
owing
no
allegiance
and
acknowledging
no
responsibility
to
the
people
to
destroy
this
invisible
government
to
dissolve
the
unholy
alliance
between
corrupt
business
and
corrupt
politics
is
the
first
task
of
the
statesmanship
of
the
day
this
country
belongs
to
the
people
its
resources
its
business
its
laws
its
institutions
should
be
utilized
maintained
or
altered
in
whatever
manner
will
best
promote
the
general
interest
this
assertion
is
explicit
we
say
directly
that
the
people
are
absolutely
to
control
in
any
way
they
see
fit
the
business
of
the
country
i
again
challenge
wilson
to
quote
any
words
of
the
platform
that
justify
the
statements
he
has
made
to
the
contrary
if
he
can
not
do
it
and
of
course
he
can
not
do
it
and
he
must
know
that
he
can
not
do
it
surely
he
will
not
hesitate
to
say
so
frankly
wilson
must
know
that
every
monopoly
in
the
united
states
opposes
the
progressive
party
if
he
challenges
this
statement
i
challenge
him
in
return
as
is
clearly
my
right
to
name
the
monopoly
that
did
support
the
progressive
party
whether
it
was
the
sugar
trust
the
steel
trust
the
harvester
trust
the
standard
oil
trust
the
tobacco
trust
or
any
other
every
sane
man
in
the
country
knows
well
that
there
is
not
one
word
of
justification
that
can
truthfully
be
adduced
for
statement
that
the
progressive
programme
was
agreeable
to
the
monopolies
ours
was
the
only
programme
to
which
they
objected
and
they
supported
either
wilson
or
taft
against
me
indifferent
as
to
which
of
them
might
be
elected
so
long
as
i
was
defeated
wilson
says
that
i
got
my
idea
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
monopoly
from
the
gentlemen
who
form
the
united
states
steel
corporation
does
wilson
pretend
that
van
hise
and
croly
got
their
ideas
from
the
steel
corporation
is
wilson
unaware
of
the
elementary
fact
that
most
modern
economists
believe
that
unlimited
unregulated
competition
is
the
source
of
evils
which
all
men
now
concede
must
be
remedied
if
this
civilization
of
ours
is
to
survive
is
he
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
socialist
party
has
long
been
against
unlimited
competition
this
statement
of
wilson
can
not
be
characterized
properly
with
any
degree
of
regard
for
the
office
wilson
holds
why
the
ideas
that
i
have
championed
as
to
controlling
and
regulating
both
competition
and
combination
in
the
interest
of
the
people
so
that
the
people
shall
be
masters
over
both
have
been
in
the
air
in
this
country
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
was
merely
the
first
prominent
candidate
for
president
who
took
them
up
they
are
the
progressive
ideas
and
progressive
business
men
must
in
the
end
come
to
them
for
i
firmly
believe
that
in
the
end
all
wise
and
honest
business
men
big
and
little
will
support
our
programme
wilson
in
opposing
them
is
the
mere
apostle
of
reaction
he
says
that
i
got
my
ideas
from
the
gentlemen
who
form
the
steel
corporation
i
did
not
but
i
will
point
out
to
him
something
in
return
it
was
he
himself
and
taft
who
got
the
votes
and
the
money
of
these
same
gentlemen
and
of
those
in
the
harvester
trust
wilson
has
promised
to
break
up
all
trusts
he
can
do
so
only
by
proceeding
at
law
if
he
proceeds
at
law
he
can
hope
for
success
only
by
taking
what
i
have
done
as
a
precedent
in
fact
what
i
did
as
president
is
the
base
of
every
action
now
taken
or
that
can
be
now
taken
looking
toward
the
control
of
corporations
or
the
suppression
of
monopolies
the
decisions
rendered
in
various
cases
brought
by
my
direction
constitute
the
authority
on
which
wilson
must
base
any
action
that
he
may
bring
to
curb
monopolistic
control
will
wilson
deny
this
or
question
it
in
any
way
with
what
grace
can
he
describe
my
administration
as
satisfactory
to
the
trusts
when
he
knows
that
he
can
not
redeem
a
single
promise
that
he
has
made
to
war
upon
the
trusts
unless
he
avails
himself
of
weapons
of
which
the
federal
government
had
been
deprived
before
i
became
president
and
which
were
restored
to
it
during
my
administration
and
through
proceedings
which
i
directed
without
my
action
wilson
could
not
now
undertake
or
carry
on
a
single
suit
against
a
monopoly
and
moreover
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
action
and
for
the
judicial
decision
in
consequence
obtained
congress
would
be
helpless
to
pass
a
single
law
against
monopoly
let
wilson
mark
that
the
men
who
organized
and
directed
the
northern
securities
company
were
also
the
controlling
forces
in
the
very
steel
corporation
which
wilson
makes
believe
to
think
was
supporting
me
i
challenge
wilson
to
deny
this
and
yet
he
well
knew
that
it
was
my
successful
suit
against
the
northern
securities
company
which
first
efficiently
established
the
power
of
the
people
over
the
trusts
after
reading
wilson
book
i
am
still
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
he
means
by
the
new
freedom
wilson
is
an
accomplished
and
scholarly
man
a
master
of
rhetoric
and
the
sentences
in
the
book
are
statements
usually
inculcating
a
morality
which
is
sound
although
vague
and
ill
defined
there
are
certain
proposals
already
long
set
forth
and
practiced
by
me
and
by
others
who
have
recently
formed
the
progressive
party
made
by
wilson
with
which
i
cordially
agree
there
are
however
certain
things
he
has
said
even
as
regards
matters
of
abstract
morality
with
which
i
emphatically
disagree
for
example
in
arguing
for
proper
business
publicity
as
to
which
i
cordially
agree
with
wilson
he
commits
himself
to
the
following
statement
you
know
there
is
temptation
in
loneliness
and
secrecy
have
you
experienced
it
i
have
we
are
never
so
proper
in
our
conduct
as
when
everybody
can
look
and
see
exactly
what
we
are
doing
if
you
are
off
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
and
suppose
that
nobody
who
lives
within
a
mile
of
your
home
is
anywhere
around
there
are
times
when
you
adjourn
your
ordinary
standards
you
say
to
yourself
i
have
a
fling
this
time
nobody
will
know
anything
about
it
if
you
were
on
the
desert
of
sahara
you
would
feel
that
you
might
permit
yourself
well
say
some
slight
latitude
of
conduct
but
if
you
saw
one
of
your
immediate
neighbors
coming
the
other
way
on
a
camel
you
would
behave
yourself
until
he
got
out
of
sight
the
most
dangerous
thing
in
the
world
is
to
get
off
where
nobody
knows
you
i
advise
you
to
stay
around
among
the
neighbors
and
then
you
may
keep
out
of
jail
that
is
the
only
way
some
of
us
can
keep
out
of
jail
i
emphatically
disagree
with
what
seems
to
be
the
morality
inculcated
in
this
statement
which
is
that
a
man
is
expected
to
do
and
is
to
be
pardoned
for
doing
all
kinds
of
immoral
things
if
he
does
them
alone
and
does
not
expect
to
be
found
out
surely
it
is
not
necessary
in
insisting
upon
proper
publicity
to
preach
a
morality
of
so
basely
material
a
character
there
is
much
more
that
wilson
says
as
to
which
i
do
not
understand
him
clearly
and
where
i
condemn
what
i
do
understand
in
economic
matters
the
course
he
advocates
as
part
of
the
new
freedom
simply
means
the
old
old
freedom
of
leaving
the
individual
strong
man
at
liberty
unchecked
by
common
action
to
prey
on
the
weak
and
the
helpless
the
new
freedom
in
the
abstract
seems
to
be
the
freedom
of
the
big
to
devour
the
little
in
the
concrete
i
may
add
that
wilson
misrepresentations
of
what
i
have
said
seem
to
indicate
that
he
regards
the
new
freedom
as
freedom
from
all
obligation
to
obey
the
ninth
commandment
but
after
all
my
views
or
the
principles
of
the
progressive
party
are
of
much
less
importance
now
than
the
purposes
of
wilson
these
are
wrapped
in
impenetrable
mystery
his
speeches
and
writings
serve
but
to
make
them
more
obscure
if
these
attempts
to
refute
his
misrepresentation
of
my
attitude
towards
the
trusts
should
result
in
making
his
own
clear
then
this
discussion
will
have
borne
fruits
of
substantial
value
to
the
country
if
wilson
has
any
plan
of
his
own
for
dealing
with
the
trusts
it
is
to
suppress
all
great
industrial
organizations
presumably
on
the
principle
proclaimed
by
his
secretary
of
state
four
years
ago
that
every
corporation
which
produced
more
than
a
certain
percentage
of
a
given
commodity
i
think
the
amount
specified
was
per
cent
no
matter
how
valuable
its
service
should
be
suppressed
the
simple
fact
is
that
such
a
plan
is
futile
in
operation
it
would
do
far
more
damage
than
it
could
remedy
the
progressive
plan
would
give
the
people
full
control
of
and
in
masterful
fashion
prevent
all
wrongdoing
by
the
trusts
while
utilizing
for
the
public
welfare
every
industrial
energy
and
ability
that
operates
to
swell
abundance
while
obeying
strictly
the
moral
law
and
the
law
of
the
land
wilson
plan
would
ultimately
benefit
the
trusts
and
would
permanently
damage
nobody
but
the
people
for
example
one
of
the
steel
corporations
which
has
been
guilty
of
the
worst
practices
towards
its
employees
is
the
colorado
fuel
and
iron
company
wilson
and
bryan
plan
would
if
successful
merely
mean
permitting
four
such
companies
absolutely
uncontrolled
to
monopolize
every
big
industry
in
the
country
to
talk
of
such
an
accomplishment
as
being
the
new
freedom
is
enough
to
make
the
term
one
of
contemptuous
derision
president
wilson
has
made
explicit
promises
and
the
democratic
platform
has
made
explicit
promises
wilson
is
now
in
power
with
a
democratic
congress
in
both
branches
he
and
the
democratic
platform
have
promised
to
destroy
the
trusts
to
reduce
the
cost
of
living
and
at
the
same
time
to
increase
the
of
the
farmer
and
of
the
workingman
which
of
course
must
mean
to
increase
the
profits
of
the
farmer
and
the
wages
of
the
workingman
he
and
his
party
won
the
election
on
this
promise
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
they
will
keep
it
if
wilson
promises
mean
anything
except
the
very
emptiest
words
he
is
pledged
to
accomplish
the
beneficent
purposes
he
avows
by
breaking
up
all
the
trusts
and
combinations
and
corporations
so
as
to
restore
competition
precisely
as
it
was
fifty
years
ago
if
he
does
not
mean
this
he
means
nothing
he
can
not
do
anything
else
under
penalty
of
showing
that
his
promise
and
his
performance
do
not
square
with
each
other
wilson
says
that
the
trusts
are
our
masters
now
but
i
for
one
do
not
care
to
live
in
a
country
called
free
even
under
kind
masters
good
the
progressives
are
opposed
to
having
masters
kind
or
unkind
and
they
do
not
believe
that
a
new
freedom
which
in
practice
would
mean
leaving
four
fuel
and
iron
companies
free
to
do
what
they
like
in
every
industry
would
be
of
much
benefit
to
the
country
the
progressives
have
a
clear
and
definite
programme
by
which
the
people
would
be
the
masters
of
the
trusts
instead
of
the
trusts
being
their
masters
as
wilson
says
they
are
with
practical
unanimity
the
trusts
supported
the
opponents
of
this
programme
taft
and
wilson
and
they
evidently
dreaded
our
programme
infinitely
more
than
anything
that
wilson
threatened
the
people
have
accepted
wilson
assurances
now
let
him
make
his
promises
good
he
is
committed
if
his
words
mean
anything
to
the
promise
to
break
up
every
trust
every
big
corporation
perhaps
every
small
corporation
in
the
united
states
not
to
go
through
the
motions
of
breaking
them
up
but
really
to
break
them
up
he
is
committed
against
the
policy
of
efficient
control
and
mastery
of
the
big
corporations
both
by
law
and
by
administrative
action
in
cooperation
proposed
by
the
progressives
let
him
keep
faith
with
the
people
let
him
in
good
faith
try
to
keep
the
promises
he
has
thus
repeatedly
made
i
believe
that
his
promise
is
futile
and
can
not
be
kept
i
believe
that
any
attempt
sincerely
to
keep
it
and
in
good
faith
to
carry
it
out
will
end
in
either
nothing
at
all
or
in
disaster
but
my
beliefs
are
of
no
consequence
wilson
is
president
it
is
his
acts
that
are
of
consequence
he
is
bound
in
honor
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
keep
his
promise
and
to
break
up
not
nominally
but
in
reality
all
big
business
all
trusts
all
combinations
of
every
sort
kind
and
description
and
probably
all
corporations
what
he
says
is
henceforth
of
little
consequence
the
important
thing
is
what
he
does
and
how
the
results
of
what
he
does
square
with
the
promises
and
prophecies
he
made
when
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
speak
not
to
act
appendix
c
the
blaine
campaign
in
the
house
of
harper
written
by
henry
harper
the
following
passage
occurs
curtis
returned
from
the
convention
in
company
with
young
theodore
roosevelt
and
they
discussed
the
situation
thoroughly
on
their
trip
to
new
york
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
consistently
support
blaine
roosevelt
however
had
a
conference
afterward
with
senator
lodge
and
eventually
fell
in
line
behind
blaine
curtis
came
to
our
office
and
found
that
we
were
unanimously
opposed
to
the
support
of
blaine
and
with
a
hearty
he
trained
his
editorial
guns
on
the
knight
of
mulligan
letter
fame
his
work
was
as
effective
and
deadly
as
any
fight
he
ever
conducted
in
the
this
statement
has
no
foundation
whatever
in
fact
i
did
not
return
from
the
convention
in
company
with
curtis
he
went
back
to
new
york
from
the
convention
whereas
i
went
to
my
ranch
in
north
dakota
no
such
conversation
as
that
ever
took
place
between
me
and
curtis
in
my
presence
in
speaking
to
a
number
of
men
at
the
time
in
chicago
curtis
said
you
younger
men
can
if
you
think
right
refuse
to
support
blaine
but
i
am
too
old
a
republican
and
have
too
long
been
associated
with
the
party
to
break
with
it
now
not
only
did
i
never
entertain
after
the
convention
but
i
never
during
the
convention
or
at
any
other
time
entertained
the
intention
alleged
in
the
quotation
in
question
i
discussed
the
whole
situation
with
lodge
before
going
to
the
convention
and
we
had
made
up
our
minds
that
if
the
nomination
of
blaine
was
fairly
made
we
would
with
equal
good
faith
support
him
