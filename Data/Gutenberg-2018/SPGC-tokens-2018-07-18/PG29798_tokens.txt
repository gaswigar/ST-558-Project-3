preface
it
is
the
object
of
this
book
to
trace
the
story
of
japan
from
its
beginnings
to
the
establishment
of
constitutional
government
concerned
as
this
story
is
with
the
period
of
vague
and
legendary
antiquity
as
well
as
with
the
disorders
of
mediæval
time
and
with
centuries
of
seclusion
it
is
plain
that
it
is
not
an
easy
task
to
present
a
trustworthy
and
connected
account
of
the
momentous
changes
through
which
the
empire
has
been
called
to
pass
it
would
be
impossible
to
state
in
detail
the
sources
from
which
i
have
derived
the
material
for
this
work
i
place
first
and
as
most
important
a
residence
of
several
years
in
japan
during
which
i
became
familiar
with
the
character
of
the
japanese
people
and
with
the
traditions
and
events
of
their
history
most
of
the
works
treating
of
japan
during
and
prior
to
the
period
of
her
seclusion
as
well
as
the
more
recent
works
i
have
had
occasion
to
consult
they
will
be
found
referred
to
in
the
following
pages
beyond
all
others
however
i
desire
to
acknowledge
my
obligations
to
the
of
the
asiatic
society
of
a
list
of
the
contributors
to
these
transactions
would
include
such
names
as
satow
aston
chamberlain
mcclatchie
gubbins
geerts
milne
whitney
wigmore
and
others
whose
investigations
have
made
possible
a
reasonably
complete
knowledge
of
japan
the
of
the
german
asiatic
are
scarcely
less
noteworthy
than
those
of
her
sister
society
to
these
invaluable
sources
of
information
are
to
be
added

have
taken
an
interest
in
this
publication
i
owe
many
thanks
for
valuable
and
timely
help
to

who
for
so
many
years
was
a
resident
in
yokohama
to

who
still
retains
his
interest
in
and
knowledge
of
things
japanese
to

the
japanese
minister
at
washington
and
to
the
departments
of
the
japanese
government
which
have
furnished
me
material
assistance
in
the
spelling
of
japanese
words
i
have
followed
with
a
few
exceptions
the
system
of
the
roman

association
rōmaji

as
given
in

have
also
had

chapter
i
the
japanese
archipelago
the
first
knowledge
of
the
japanese
empire
was
brought
to
europe
by
marco
polo
after
his
return
from
his
travels
in
china
in
he
had
been
told
in
china
of
chipangu
an
island
towards
the
east
in
the
high
seas
miles
from
the
continent
and
a
very
great
island
it
is
the
people
are
white
civilized
and
well
favored
they
are
idolaters
and
are
dependent
on
nobody
and
i
can
tell
you
the
quantity
of
gold
they
have
is
endless
for
they
find
it
in
their
own
the
name
chipangu
is
the
transliteration
of
the
chinese
name
which
modern
scholars
write
by
which
japan
was
then
known
in
china
from
it
the
japanese
derived
the
name
nippon
and
then
prefixed
the
term
dai
great
making
it
dai
nippon
the
name
which
is
now
used
by
them
to
designate
their
empire
europeans
transformed
the
chinese
name
into
japan
or
japon
by
which
the
country
is
known
among
them
at
present
marco
polo
s
mention
of
this
island
produced
a
great
impression
on
the
discoverers
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
toscanelli
s
map
used
by
columbus
as
the
basis
of
his
voyages
cipango
occupies
a
prominent
place
to
the
east
of
asia
with
no
american
continent
between
it
and
europe
it
was
the
aim
of
columbus
and
of
many
subsequent
explorers
to
find
a
route
to
this
reputedly
rich
island
and
to
the
eastern
shores
of
asia
the
islands
composing
the
empire
of
japan
are
situated
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
they
are
part
of
the
long
line
of
volcanic
islands
stretching
from
the
peninsula
of
kamtschatka
on
the
north
to
formosa
on
the
south
the
direction
in
which
they
lie
is
northeast
and
southwest
and
in
a
general
way
they
are
parallel
to
the
continent
the
latitude
of
the
most
northern
point
of
yezo
is
and
the
latitude
of
the
most
southern
point
of
kyūshū
is
the
longitude
of
the
most
eastern
point
of
yezo
is
and
the
longitude
of
the
most
western
point
of
kyūshū
is
the
four
principal
islands
therefore
extend
through
of
latitude
and
of
longitude
the
kurile
islands
extending
from
yezo
northeast
to
the
straits
separating
kamtschatka
from
the
island
of
shumushu
belong
also
to
japan
this
last
island
has
a
latitude
of
and
a
longitude
of
in
like
manner
the
ryūkyū
islands
lying
in
a
southwest
direction
from
kyūshū
belong
to
japan
the
most
distant
island
has
a
latitude

a
longitude
of
the
empire
consists
of
four
large
islands
and
not
less
than
three
thousand
small
ones
some
of
these
small
islands
are
large
enough
to
constitute
distinct
provinces
but
the
greater
part
are
too
small
to
have
a
separate
political
existence
and
are
attached
for
administrative
purposes
to
the
parts
of
the
large
islands
opposite
to
which
they
lie
the
principal

shimonoseki
straits
the
greatest
extension
of
the

a
distance
of
about
miles
that
is
measuring
in
the
direction
of
the
greatest
extension
the
island
is
about
miles
long
the
width
of
the
island
is
nowhere
greater
than
two
hundred

for
much
of
its

not
more
than
one

the
manner
in
which
it
was
divided
in
early
times
it

kyūshū
which
in
climate
and
productions
it
much
resembles
it
is
south
of
the
western
extension
of
the
main

and
is
nearly
parallel
to
it
its
length
is
about
miles
in
the
early
history
of
japan
one
of
its
names
among
the
natives
was
ōyashima

the
kuro
shiwo
black
current
flows
from
the
tropical
waters
in
a
northeast
direction
skirting
the
islands
of
japan
on
their
east
coasts
and
deflecting
its
course
to
the
eastward
carries
its
ameliorating
influences
to
the
west
coast
of
america
it
is
divided
by
the
projecting
southern
extremity
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
and
a
perceptible
portion
of
it
flows
on
the
west
coast
of
the
japanese
islands
through
the
japan
sea
and
out
again
into
the
pacific
ocean
through
the
tsugaru
and
the
la
perouse
straits
the
effect
of
the
kuro
shiwo
upon
the
climate
and
productions
of
the
lands
along
which
it
flows
is
not
greatly
different
from
that
of
the
gulf
stream
in
the
atlantic
ocean
which
in
situation
direction
and
volume
it
resembles
the
body
of
water
known
among
foreigners
as
the
inland
sea
but
which
the
japanese
call
the
sea
within
the
straits
is
a
picturesque
sheet
of
water
situated
between
the
linschoten
straits
on
the
east
and
the
shimonoseki
straits
on
the
west
the
latter
is
seven
miles
long
and
at
its
narrowest
part
not
more
than
two
thousand
feet
wide
it
separates
kyūshū
on
the
south
from
the
main
island
on
the
north
the
inland
sea
is
occupied
by
an
almost
countless
number
of
islands
which
bear
evidence
of
volcanic
origin
and
are
covered
with
luxuriant
vegetation
the
lines
of
steamers
from
shanghai
and
nagasaki
to
the
various
ports
on
the
main
island
and
numberless
smaller
craft
in
every
direction
run
through
the
inland
sea
the
principal
islands
of
japan
are
interspersed
with
mountains
hills
and
valleys
yezo
the
most
northern
of
these
islands
is
traversed
by
two
ranges
of
mountains
the
one
being
the
extension
of
the
island
of
saghalien
the
other
the
extension
of
the
kurile
islands
these
two
ranges
cross
each
other
at
the
centre
of
the
island
and
here
the
greatest
elevation
is
to
be
found
the
shape
given
to
the
island
by
these
intersecting
ranges
is
that
of
a
star
the
rivers
in
nearly
all
cases
flow
from
the
centre
outward
to
the
sea
there
are
few
large
rivers
the
most
important
is
the
ishikari
which
empties
into
ishikari
bay
the
valley
of
this
river
is
the
most
rich
and
fertile
part
of
the
island
the
mountain
ranges
on
the
main
island
extend
usually
in
the
greatest
direction
of
the
island
in
the
northern
and
central
portions
the
ranges
chiefly
run
north
and
south
in
the
western
extension
of
this
island
the
mountain
ranges
run
in
nearly
an
east
and
west
direction
the
ordinary
height
attained
by
these
ranges
is
not
great
but
there
are
many
volcanic
peaks
which
rise
out
of
the
surrounding
mass
to
a
great
elevation
the
highest
mountain
in
japan
is
sometimes
called
it
is
almost
conical
in
shape
although
one
side
has
been
deformed
by
a
volcanic
eruption
which
occurred
in
it
stands
not
far
from
the
coast
and
is
directly
in
view
from
the
steamers
entering
the
bay
of
tōkyō
on
their
way
to
yokohama
it
is
about
sixty
miles
from
tōkyō
in
a
direct
line
and
there
are
many
places
in
the
city
from
which
it
can
be
seen
its
top
is
covered
with
snow
during
ten
months
of
the
year
which
the
heat
of
august
and
september
melts
away
the
height
of
according
to
the
measurement
of
english
naval
officers
is
feet
next
to
the
mountains
most
worthy
of
notice
are
in
uzen
mitake
in
shinano
the
nikkō
mountains
in
shimotsuke
in
kaga
in
hyūga
and
in
shinano
is
about
feet
high
and
is
an
active
volcano
from
time
immemorial
the
japanese
islands
have
been
affected
with
earthquakes
occasionally
they
have
been
severe
and
destructive
but
usually
slight
and
ineffective
it
is
said
that
not
less
than
five
hundred
shocks
occur
in
japan
each
year
the
last
severe
earthquake
was
in
the
autumn
of
when
the
central
part
of
the
main
island
especially
in
the
neighborhood
of
gifu
was
destructively
disturbed
during
the
long
history
of
the
empire
many
notable
cases
have
occurred
in
a
paper
read
before
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
march
has
compiled
a
list
of
destructive
earthquakes
and
has
deduced
from
it
some
important
generalizations
closely
associated
with
earthquakes
in
japan
as
elsewhere
are
the
phenomena
of
volcanoes
the
whole
archipelago
bears
evidence
of
volcanic
formation
the
long
line
of
islands
stretching
from
kamtschatka
to
borneo
is
plainly
the
product
of
continued
volcanic
action
dr
rein
enumerates
eighteen
active
volcanoes
now
in
existence
within
the
empire
in
all
its
beauty
was
no
doubt
thrown
up
as
a
volcano
the
last
time
it
was
in
action
was
in
when
in
connection
with
a
series
of
severe
earthquake
shocks
an
eruption
took
place
on
the
south
side
of
the
mountain
and
its
symmetrical
form
was
destroyed
by
the
production
of
the
new
crater
among
the
mountainous
districts
many
small
lakes
are
found
a
few
of
which
are
large
enough
to
be
navigated
in
yezo
there
are
six
considerable
lakes
in
the
main
island
the
largest
lake
is
biwa
in
the
beautiful
mountain
region
north
of
kyōto
it
received
its
name
from
its
fancied
resemblance
to
the
shape
of
a
musical
instrument
called
a
there
is
a
legend
that
this
lake
came
into
existence
in
a
single
night
when
the
volcanic
mountain
miles
distant
was
raised
to
its
present
height
it
is
about
fifty
miles
long
and
about
twenty
miles
broad
at
its
greatest
width
it
is
said
to
be
not
less
than
feet
at
its
greatest
depth
it
is
navigated
by
steamboats
and
smaller
craft
it
is
situated
about

rivers
of
a
large
size
most
of
them
take
their
rise
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
middle
of
the
islands
and
by
a
more
or
less
circuitous
route
find
their
way
to
the
ocean
the
means
river
is
the
longest
and
broadest
of
the
rivers
of
japan
it
rises
in
kōtsuke
and
flows
in
an
eastern
direction
receiving
many
tributaries
attains
a
breadth
of
more
than
a
mile
and
with
a
current
much
narrowed
empties
into
the
pacific
ocean
at
chōshi
point
it
is
about
miles
long
and
is
navigated
by
boats
for
a
great
distance
the
which
may
be
named
as
second
in
size
rises
in
the
province
of
shinano
flows
in
a
northern
direction
and
empties
into
the
japan
sea
at
the
also
rises
in
the
high
lands
of
shinano
and
flowing
southward
empties
into
owari
bay
the
takes
its
rise
in
the
northern
part
of
the
province
of
kai
and
in
its
course
skirting
the
base
of
on
the
west
empties
into
suruga
bay
it
is
chiefly
notable
for
being
one
of
the
swiftest
streams
in
japan
and
liable
to
sudden
and
great
floods
to
these
rivers
may
be
added
the
which
is
the
outlet
of
lake
biwa
in
the
province
of
ōmi
and
which
flows
through
kyōto
and
empties
into
the
inland
sea
at
ōsaka
this
river
is
navigable
for
steamboats
as
far
as
kyōto
in
the
islands
of
kyūshū
and
shikoku
there
are
no
large
rivers
but
there
are
many
streams
which
give
to
these
islands
their
richness
and
fertility
the
climate
of
japan
as
might
be
expected
from
its
great
stretch
from
north
to
south
and
the
varied
circumstances
of
ocean
currents
winds
and
mountains
is
very
different
in
the
different
parts
the
latitude
of
tōkyō
is
which
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
cyprus
in
the
mediterranean
or
the
city
of
raleigh
in
north
carolina
besides
the
latitude
of
the
islands
of
japan
the
most
noticeable
cause
of
their
climatic
condition
is
the
kuro
shiwo
black
current
this
current
flows
from
the
tropical
regions
near
the
philippine
islands
impinges
on
the
southern
islands
and
is
divided
by
them
into
two
unequal
parts
the
greater
part
skirts
the
japanese
islands
on
their
east
coast
imparting
to
them
that
warm
and
moist
atmosphere
which
is
one
source
of
the
fertility
of
their
soil
and
beauty
of
their
vegetation
to
this
important
cause
must
be
added
another
which
is
closely
related
to
it
in
its
effects
the
japanese
islands
are
in
the
region
of
the
monsoon
which
affects
in
a
marked
degree
the
climate
of
all
parts
over
which
the
winds
extend
the
same
monsoon
blows
over
the
eastern
countries
of
the
continent
but
the
insular
character
of
japan
and
the
proximity
of
the
warm
current
on
both
sides
of
the
islands
give
to
the
winds
which
prevail
a
character
which
they
do
not
possess
on
the
continent
during
the
greater
part
of
september
the
northern
wind
blows
which
brings
a
colder
temperature
condensing
the
moisture
contained
in
the
atmosphere
this
month
is
therefore
generally
a
rainy
month
gradually
the
atmosphere
becomes
more
dry
and
the
beautiful
autumn
and
early
winter
follow
in
course
the
winter
is
very
different
in
the
different
parts
on
the
east
coast
the
temperature
is
very
moderate
even
as
far
north
as
tōkyō
the
snow
rarely
falls
to
a
depth
of
more
than
a
few
inches
and
then
rapidly
melts
away
ice
seldom
forms
to
a
thickness
even
on
protected
waters
to
permit
skating
in
all
this
region
however
snow
covers
the
high
mountains
on
the
west
coast
of
the
main
island
the
conditions
are
very
different
the
winds
of
the
continent
take
up
the
moisture
of
the
japan
sea
and
carry
it
to
the
west
coast
and
then
coming
in
contact
with
high
ranges
of
mountains
which
run
down
the
middle
of
the
island
impart
their
moisture
in
the
form
of
rain
in
summer
and
snow
in
winter
these
circumstances
produce
extraordinary
falls
of
snow
on
the
west
coast
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
provinces
of
kaga
noto
etchū
echigo
and
even
farther
north
especially
in
the
mountainous
regions
in
the
northern
part
of
these
districts
the
snow
is
often
as
much
as
twenty
feet
deep
during
the
winter
months
the
inhabitants
are
obliged
to
live
in
the
second
stories
of
their
houses
and
often
find
it
necessary
to
make
steps
from
their
houses
out
to
the
top
of
the
snow
one
effect
of
these
deep
snows
is
to
cover
up
with
a
safe
protection
the
shrubs
and
tender
plants
which
would
otherwise
be
exposed
to
the
chilling
winds
of
winter
by
this
means
the
and
the
camellia
which
could
not
withstand
the
open
winter
winds
are
protected
so
as
to
grow
luxuriantly
the
southern
islands
are
materially
warmer
than
the
main
island
the
tropical
current
together
with
the
warm
sunshine
due
to
their
low
latitude
immerses
them
in
a
moist
and
warm
atmosphere
their
productions
are
of
a
character
cotton
rice
tobacco
sugar
sweet
potatoes
oranges
yams
and
other
plants
of
a
warm
latitude
flourish
in
kyūshū
and
shikoku
the
high
mountains
and
the
well
watered
valleys
the
abundance
of
forest
trees
and
wild
and
luxuriant
vegetation
give
to
these
islands
an
aspect
of
perennial
verdure
the
productions
of
the
main
island
are
as
might
be
expected
far
more
various
in
the
southern
part
especially
that
part
bordering
on
the
inland
sea
the
productions
are
to
a
large
extent
similar
to
those
in
the
southern
islands
rice
and
cotton
are
raised
in
great
abundance
tea
flourishes
particularly
in
the
provinces
near
kyōto
and
also
in
the
rich
valleys
of
the
east
coast
is
a
principal
occupation
nearly
one
half
in
value
of
all
the
exports
from
japan
is
raw
and
manufactured
silk
and
a
large
part
of
the
remainder
is
tea
the
principal
food
raised
in
nearly
all
the
islands
is
rice
the
streams
of
water
which
abound
everywhere
make
the
irrigation
which
rice
cultivation
requires
easy
and
effective
besides
the
rice
which
is
raised
in
paddy
land
there
is
also
a
variety
called
upland
rice
this
grows
without
irrigation
but
is
inferior
to
the
principal
variety
in
productiveness
in
the
early
rituals
of
the
shintō
temples
prayers
were
always
offered
for
the
five
cereals
these
were
understood
to
be
rice
millet
barley
beans
and
sorghum
all
these
have
been
cultivated
from
early
times
and
can
be
successfully
raised
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
islands
rice
can
not
however
be
raised
north
of
the
main
island
millet
barley
and
beans
are
cultivated
everywhere
and
are
the
principal
articles
of
food
among
the
country
population
buckwheat
is
also
cultivated
in
all
northern
parts
it
is
believed
to
have
been
introduced
from
manchuria
where
it
is
found
growing
wild
the
domestic
animals
of
japan
are
by
no
means
so
abundant
as
in
the
corresponding
parts
of
the
continent
the
horse
has
existed
here
from
antiquity
but
was
only
used
for
riding
or
as
a
but
never
until
recently
was
used
for
driving
the
cow
owing
perhaps
to
the
restrictive
influence
of
the
buddhist
doctrines
was
never
used
for
food
even
milk
butter
and
cheese
which
from
time
immemorial
formed
such
important
articles
of
food
throughout
europe
and
among
the
nomadic
peoples
of
asia
were
never
used
sheep
are
almost
unknown
even
to
this
day
and
where
they
have
been
introduced
it
is
only
in
very
recent
times
and
by
foreign
enterprise
goats
are
sometimes
but
not
commonly
found
on
the
island
of
ōshima
off
the
province
of
izu
they
had
multiplied
to
so
great
an
extent
and
were
so
destructive
to
vegetation
that
about
the
inhabitants
combined
to
extirpate
them
swine
are
found
in
the
ryūkyū
islands
where
they
had
been
brought
from
china
and
they
are
found
only
incidentally
in
other
places
when
introduced
by
foreigners
dogs
and
cats
and
barnyard
fowl
are
found
in
all
the
islands
wild
animals
are
only
moderately
abundant
as
is
natural
in
a
country
so
thickly
inhabited
the
black
bear
is
found
frequently
in
the
mountains
of
yezo
and
the
northern
part
of
the
main
island
the
great
bear
called
also
by
the
japanese
the
red
bear
and
which
is
the
same
as
the
grizzly
bear
of
north
america
is
also
common
in
the
kurile
islands
and
in
yezo
the
wolf
is
sometimes
found
and
the
fox
is
common
the
superstitions
concerning
the
fox
are
as
remarkable
as
those
in
the
north
of
europe
and
have
doubtless
prevented
its
destruction
deer
are
found
in
abundance
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
islands
they
are
however
most
common
in
yezo
where
immense
herds
feed
upon
the
plentiful
herbage
the
waters
around
japan
abound
in
fish
the
coast
is
indented
by
bays
and
inlets
which
give
opportunity
for
fishing
the
warm
currents
flowing
past
the
islands
bring
a
great
variety
of
fish
which
otherwise
would
not
reach
these
islands
by
far
the
most
common
article
of
food
other
than
vegetable
is
the
fish
of
various
kinds
and
the
which
are
caught
on
the
coasts
and
carried
inland
to
almost
all
parts
the
division
of
the
empire
into
provinces
was
an
important
step
in
practical
administration
and
it
is
often
referred
to
in
these
pages
this
division
was
first
made
by
the
emperor
seimu
when
provinces
were
constituted
the
northern
boundary
of
the
empire
was
indicated
by
a
line
across
the
main
island
from
sendai
bay
to
a
place
on
the
west
coast
nearly
corresponding
to
the
present
situation
of
north
of
this
line
was
the
acknowledged
territory
of
the
ainos
and
even
south
of
it
were
many
tracts
which
were
the
disputed
border
the
empress
jingō
after
her
return
from
the
expedition
against
korea
in
introduced
the
korean
system
of
division
by
constituting
the
home
provinces
and
circuits
after
some
changes
and
subdivisions
in
subsequent
times
the
apportionment
was
settled
as
follows
or
the
five
home
provinces
viz
yamashiro
yamato
kawachi
izumi
and
settsu
or
eastern
sea
circuit
provinces
or
eastern

eight
provinces
or
mountain
back
circuit
eight
provinces
or
mountain
front
circuit
eight
provinces
and
or
western
sea
circuit
nine
provinces
in
all
provinces
after
the
close
of
the
war
of
restoration
in
the
large
territories
in
the
north
of
the
main
island
represented
by
the
provinces
of
mutsu
and
dewa
which
had
been
conquered
from
the
ainos
were
subdivided
into
seven
provinces
thus
making
still
later
the
island
of
yezo
with
which
were
associated
the
kurile
islands
was
created
a
circuit
under
the
name
of
or
north
sea
circuit
having
eleven
provinces
the
number
of
existing
provinces
therefore
is
in
recent
times
these
provinces
have
for
administrative
purposes
been
consolidated
into
three
imperial
cities
prefectures
and
one
territory
the
imperial
cities
are
tōkyō
ōsaka
and
kyōto
the
one
territory
comprises
the
island
of
yezo
and
the
adjacent
small
islands
including
the
kuriles
and
the
prefectures
have
been
formed
from
the
provinces
by
combining
and
consolidating
them
in
accordance
with
their
convenience
and
proximity
there
are
only
a
few
large
cities
in
japan
but
very
many
of
a
small
size
tōkyō
the
capital
contains
inhabitants
ōsaka
the
second
largest
city
contains
kyōto
the
old
capital
nagoya
kōbé
and
yokohama
these
are
all
the
cities
containing
as
many
as
inhabitants
besides
these
there
are
four
cities
which
have
between
and
twelve
which
have
between
and
and
twelve
which
have
between
and
the
number
of
smaller
towns
is
very
great
the
division
of
the
country
into
and
the
maintenance
of
a
town
in
each
led
to
the
establishment
of
many
cities
and
large
villages
the
population
of
the
empire
of
japan
is
to
a
large
extent
massed
in
cities
and
villages
even
in
the
country
among
the
farmers
the
people
are
gathered
in
settlements
with
wide
spaces
of
cultivated
and
uncultivated
land
between
this
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
character
of
the
crops
and
to
the
primitive
nature
of
the
cultivation
rice
which
is
the
most
common
crop
requires
irrigation
for
its
successful
tillage
this
limits
the
area
occupied
to
the
valleys
and
to
those
hillsides
where
the
streams
can
be
diverted
to
the
rice
fields
the
area
of
land
under
actual
cultivation
is
about
acres
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
average
amount
of
land
under
cultivation
is
only
three
quarters
of
an
acre
for
each
of
those
engaged
in
farming
this
amount
seems
to
us
very
little
and
can
only
be
explained
by
the
character
of
the
cultivation
the
land
almost
always
is
made
to
bear
two
crops
each
year
as
soon
as
one
crop
is
cleared
away
and
often
even
before
that
another
is
planted

the
original

races
in

there
are
two
distinct
races
the

the
japanese
of
the
former
there
is
only
a
small
number
now
remaining
in
the
island

there
was
also
a
remnant
in

in
when
a
treaty
was
made
with
russia
ceding
the
japanese
claim
to
the
southern
half
of
saghalien
in
exchange
for
the
kurile
islands
permission
was
granted
for
all

island
of

accordingly
among
other
japanese
subjects
seven
hundred
and
fifty
ainos
removed
to
the
valley
of
the
ishikari
where
they
have
continued
to
reside
illustration
aino
family
the
ainos
are
probably
the
original
race
who
in
early
times
inhabited
the
main
island
down
to
the
hakoné
pass
and
possibly
farther
to
the
south
from
japanese
history
we
learn
that
the
military
forces
of
the
empire
were
constantly
employed
to
suppress
the
disturbances
caused
by
the
barbarous
people
of
the
north
the
necessity
of
this
forcible
repression
which
frequently
recurred
was
a
chief
reason
for
the
formation
of
a
military
class
in
the
early
history
of
japan
one
of
the
duties
imposed
on
by
his
imperial
father
was
to
chastise
and
subdue
the
yemishi
this
is
the
name
by
which
the
barbarous
peoples
of
the
north
and
east
were
known
among
the
japanese
according
to
chamberlain
in
his
translation
of
the
chinese
characters
with
which
the
yemishi
is
written
mean
prawn
barbarians
in
allusion
to
the
long
beards
which
make
their
faces
resemble
a
prawn
s
head
the
hairy
people
now
known
as
ainos
are
almost
certainly
referred
to
the
origin
of
the
term
aino
is
unknown
by
the
japanese
it
is
believed
to
be
derived
from
meaning
a
dog
and
to
have
been
bestowed
on
them
in
contempt
the
name
is
not
used
by
the
ainos
themselves
in
common
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
kurile
islands
and
the
japanese
portion
of
saghalien
they
call
themselves
yezo
the
present
characteristics
of
the
ainos
have
led
many
to
doubt
whether
they
are
really
the
descendants
of
the
hardy
barbarians
who
so
long
withstood
the
military
power
of
the
japanese
but
the
effect
of
centuries
of
repression
and
conquest
must
be
taken
into
account
the
ainos
have
become
the
peaceable
and
inoffensive
people
which
we
now
find
them
by
many
generations
of
cruel
and
imperious
restraint
that
they
should
have
become
in
this
sequence
of
events
a
quiet
and
submissive
people
is
not
wonderful
the
number
of
ainos
in
the
island
of
yezo
is
given
in
which
is
the
last
census
made
of
them
as
and
this
number
is
believed
to
be
gradually
decreasing
travellers
who
have
visited
them
unite
in
testifying
to
their
great
amiability
and
docility
physically
they
are
a
sturdy
and
well
developed
race
the
characteristic
which
has
been
noticed
in
them
more
than
any
other
is
the
abundant

the

have
a
heavy
and
bushy
head
of
hair
and
a
full
beard
which
is
allowed
to
grow
down
to
their
chests
other
parts
of
the
body
are
also
covered
with
a
growth
which
far
surpasses
that
of
the
ordinary
races
in
the
matter
of
food
clothing
houses
and
implements
they
remain
in
the
most
primitive
condition
in
personal
habits
they
are
far
less
cleanly
than
their
japanese
neighbors
travellers
who
have
remained
with
them
for
many
weeks
assert
that
in
all
that
time
they
never
saw
them
wash
either
their
persons
or
their
clothes
they
practise
few
arts
the
making
of
pottery
even
in
its
rudest
forms
is
unknown
all
vessels
in
use
are
obtained
by
barter
from
the
japanese
occasionally
an
japanese
matchlock
gun
is
found
among
them
but
mainly
their
hunting
is
carried
on
with
bows
and
arrows
their
fishing
is
conducted
with
the
rude
apparatus
which
their
ancestors
used
they
have
no
written
language
and
even
the
pictorial
writing
which
has
often
been
found
among
rude
people
seems
to
be
utterly
unknown
among
them
their
religious
ideas
are
of
the
most
vague
and
incoherent
description
the
objects
of
worship
are
chiefly
inanimate
objects
such
as
rivers
rocks
and
mountains
they
seem
to
have
a
certain
fear
of
the
spirit
land
they
do
not
readily
talk
about
their
deceased
ancestors
their
places
of
burial
are
concealed
and
foreigners
rarely
obtain
access
to
them
in
their
rude
superstitions
the
bear
seems
to
have
a
singular
part
whether
their
traditions
concerning
this
animal
had
their
origin
in
some
earlier
fear
of
the
bear
as
a
ferocious
neighbor
it
is
impossible
to
determine
in
every
community
the
men
capture
each
spring
a
young
cub
which
they
bring
home
they
entrust
it
to
a
woman
who
feeds
it
on
the
milk
from
her
breast
when
it
is
too
old
to
be
further
nursed
in
this
way
it
is
confined
in
a
bear
cage
provided
for
the
purpose
then
in
the
autumn
of
the
following
year
the
grand
bear
festival
is
held
at
an
appointed
signal
the
door
of
the
cage
is
opened
and
the
bear
which
has
been
infuriated
by
hunger
and
teasing
attacks
rushes
out
the
assembled
hunters
rush
upon
him
with
bows
and
arrows
clubs
and
knives
and
after
an
exciting
struggle
despatch
him
the
carcass
is
cut
in
pieces
and
distributed
among
the
families
of
the
community
who
feast
upon
it
with
great
delight
mingled
with
this
rough
and
exciting
scene
is
much
drinking
this
is
one
accomplishment
which
they
have
learned
from
the
japanese
the
men
are
all
confirmed
drinkers
and
both
men
and
women
persistent
smokers
of
the
meaning
and
object
of
this
bear
feast
the
ainos
themselves
are
ignorant
it
goes
back
to
a
period
beyond
their
present
traditions
whether
it
has
in
it
an
element
of
bear
worship
it
is
impossible
to
learn
the
remains
of
the
stone
age
which
are
found
in
the
northern
part
of
the
main
island
are
usually
attributed
to
the
ainos
these
remains
have
been
collected
and
studied
both
by
native
scholars
and
by
foreigners
among
the
most
important
of
them
have
been
the
articles
found
in
shell
heaps
uncovered
in
different
parts
of
the
empire
the
first
to
which
foreign
attention
was
drawn
was
that
at
ōmori
near
tōkyō
since
then
many
others
have
been
opened
and
many
valuable
finds
have
been
reported
the
shell
heaps
have
evidently
been
used
like
in
europe
and
elsewhere
as
places
for
dumping
the
refuse
of
used
for
food
these
became
places
for
the
throwing
of
useless
and
broken
articles
used
in
the
household
and
thus
have
been
the
means
of
preserving
many
of
the
implements
used
in
prehistoric
times
the
most
significant
discovery
made
in
these
shell
heaps
was
that
at
ōmori
of
the
bones
of
human
beings
artificially
broken
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
that
cannibalism
had
been
prevalent
at
the
time
whether
this
can
be
assumed
as
sufficient
proof
of
so
grave
a
charge
has
been
disputed
it
is
claimed
that
in
at
least
seven
similar
shell
heaps
no
human
bones
and
no
evidences
of
cannibalism
were
found
if
however
the
case
is
considered
as
sufficiently
proved
it
is
clear
from
this
as
well
as
from
many
other
circumstances
that
the
ainos
of
that
early
day
were
by
no
means
the
mild
and
gentle
race
which
we
now
find
them
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
marco
polo
mentions
cannibalism
as
one
of
the
customs
which
were
believed
to
exist
in
japan
in
his
day
besides
the
ainos
there
is
evidence
of
the
existence
of
another
savage
tribe
which
at
an
early
date
seems
to
have
been
found
in
many
parts
of
the
main
island
and
at
a
later
date
in
the
island
of
yezo
and
the
kurile
islands
on
the
north
they
are
the
in
the
very
earliest
writings
of
the
japanese
we
find
references
to
them
they
dug
pits
in
the
earth
and
built
over
them
a
roof
and
used
these
pits
or
cellars
as
rooms
in
which
to
sleep
the
japanese
conquerors
in
the
central
parts
of
the
main
island
had
many
conflicts
with
these
and
in
the
north
and
east
they
as
well
as
the
ainos
were
encountered
by
the
military
forces
of
the
empire
they
were
probably
driven
north
by
the
more
powerful
ainos
and
have
almost
disappeared
abundant
evidence
however
is
found
in
the
island
of
yezo
of
their
previous
existence
the
ainos
in
their
traditions
call
them
or
among
the
japanese
they
are
spoken
of
as
or
dwarfs
there
are
said
to
be
still
in
yezo
the
remains
of
villages
where
these
men
lived
in
earlier
times
in
the
kurile
islands
in
the
peninsula
of
kamtschatka
and
in
the
southern
part
of
saghalien
remnants
of
this
primitive
people
are
met
with
turning
now
to
the
japanese
race
which
extends
from
the
kurile
islands
on
the
north
to
the
ryūkyū
islands
on
the
south
we
see
at
once
that
it
is
a
mixed
race
containing
widely
different
elements
even
after
the
many
centuries
during
which
the
amalgamation
has
been
going
on
we
recognize
still
the
varying
types
to
which
the
individuals
tend
in
the
south
more
than
in
the
north
and
more
among
the
ruling
classes
than
in
the
laboring
classes
there
are
specimens
of
a
delicate
refined
appearance
face
oval
eyes
oblique
nose
slightly
roman
and
frame
delicate
but
well
proportioned
then
there
is
another
type
which
has
been
recognized
by
all
observers
it
is
found
more
in
the
north
than
the
south
and
is
much
more
common
among
the
laboring
population
than
among
the
higher
classes
the
face
is
broad
and
the
cheek
bones
prominent
the
nose
is
flat
and
the
eyes
are
horizontal
the
frame
is
robust
and
muscular
but
not
so
well
proportioned
and
regular
as
in
the
former
type
these
two
types
with
many
intervening
links
are
found
everywhere
the
characteristics
are
perhaps
more
marked
among
the
women
than
the
men
especially
among
the
aristocracy
the
women
have
been
less
affected
by
weather
and
exposure
and
physical
exertion
than
the
men
in
the
regions
about
kyōto
and
in
the
western
portions
of
the
main
island
the
prevalence
of
what
may
be
called
the
aristocratic
type
is
most
marked
even
in
the
time
of
the
dutch
trade
with
japan
kaempfer
refers
to
the
women
of
saga
on
the
south
coast
of
the
inland
sea
as
handsomer
than
in
any
other
asiatic
the
northern
regions
including
the
old
provinces
of
mutsu
and
dewa
show
a
much
larger
element
of
the
more
robust
type
the
men
are
more
muscular
and
of
a
darker
complexion
their
faces
are
broader
and
flatter
and
their
hair
and
beard
more
abundant
they
show
probably
the
influence
of
the
admixture
with
the
aino
race
which
within
historic
times
inhabited
these
provinces
baelz
a
german
scholar
who
has
spent
many
years
in
japan
has
devoted
much
study
to
the
races
of
japan
and
has
made
elaborate
measurements
both
of
living
specimens
and
skeletons
his
conclusions
may
be
safely
followed
as
having
been
reached
by
adequate
study
and
by
personal
investigation
mainly
following
him
therefore
we
give
briefly
the
results
of
the
best
thought
in
regard
to
the
ethnography
of
the
races
now
inhabiting
the
japanese
islands
the
ainos
of
the
present
day
are
the
descendants
of
the
original
occupants
of
northern
and
central
portions
of
the
main
island
their
share
in
the
ancestry
of
the
present
japanese
people
is
not
great
but
still
sensible
and
has
contributed
to
the
personal
peculiarities
which
are
found
in
the
inhabitants
of
these
regions
they
probably
came
originally
from
the
continent
by
way
of
the
kurile
islands
or
by
the
island
of
saghalien
they
belong
to
the
northern
group
of
the
mongolians
who
inhabit
the
regions
about
kamtschatka
and
adjacent
parts
of
siberia
they
have
left
marks
of
their
occupancy
on
the
main
island
as
far
south
as
the
hakoné
pass
in
the
shell
heaps
flint
and
remains
of
primitive
pottery
which
are
still
found
these
marks
indicate
a
low
degree
of
civilization
and
the
persistence
with
which
they
withstood
the
japanese
conquerors
and
the
harshness
and
contempt
with
which
they
were
always
treated
have
prevented
them
from
mingling
to
any
great
extent
with
their
conquerors
or
accepting
their
culture
the
twofold
character
of
the
japanese
race
as
it
is
seen
at
present
can
best
be
explained
by
two
extensive
migrations
from
the
continent
the
first
of
these
migrations
probably
took
place
from
korea
whence
they
landed
on
the
main
island
in
the
province
of
izumo
this
will
account
for
the
mythological
legends
which
in
the
early
japanese
accounts
cluster
to
so
great
an
extent
around
izumo
it
will
also
explain
why
it
was
that
when
jimmu
tennō
came
on
his
expedition
from
the
island
of
kyūshū
he
found
on
the
main
island
inhabitants
who
in
all
essential
particulars
resembled
his
own
forces
and
with
whom
he
formed
alliances
this
first
migration
seems
to
have
belonged
to
a
rougher
and
more
barbarous
tribe
of
the
mongolian
race
and
has
given
rise
to
the
more
robust
and
muscular
element
now
found
among
the
people
the
second
migration
may
have
come
across
by
the
same
route
and
landed
on
the
island
of
kyūshū
they
may
have
marched
across
the
island
or
skirted
around
its
southern
cape
and
spread
themselves
out
in
the
province
of
hyūga
where
in
the
japanese
accounts
we
first
find
them
this
migration
probably
occurred
long
after
the
first
and
came
evidently
from
a
more
cultured
tribe
of
the
great
mongolian
race
that
they
came
from
the
same
race
is
evident
from
their
understanding
the
same
language
and
having
habits
and
methods
of
government
which
were
not
a
surprise
to
the
and
in
which
they
readily
on
the
contrary
the
ruder
tribes
at
the
north
of
the
main
island
were
spoken
of
as
yemishi
is
barbarians
and
recognized
from
the
first
as
different
and
inferior
while
the
natural
and
easiest
route
to
japan
would
be
by
way
of
the
peninsula
of
korea
and
by
the
narrow
straits
about
miles
in
width
into
two
shorter
parts
by
the
island
tsushima
lying
about
between
is
possible
that
this
second
migration
may
have
taken
place
through
formosa
and
the
ryūkyū
islands
this
would
perhaps
account
better
for
the
malay
element
which
is
claimed
by
many
to
be
found
in
the
population
of
the
southern
islands
this
is
attempted
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
drifting
of
malay
castaways
along
the
equatorial
current
upon
the
ryūkyū
islands
whence
they
spread
to
the
southern
islands
of
japan
but
the
existence
of
this
malay
element
is
denied
by
many
observers
who
have
visited
the
ryūkyū
islands
and
aver
that
among
the
islanders
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
existence
at
any
time
of
a
malay
immigration
that
the
language
is
only
slightly
different
from
the
japanese
and
in
personal
appearance
they
are
as
like
to
the
koreans
and
chinese
as
the
japanese
themselves
some
of
the
most
important
measurements
which
baelz
has
made
of
the
japanese
races
are
here
given
converted
into
english
measures
for
more
ready
comprehension
the
average
height
of
the
males
among
the
japanese
as
obtained
by
the
measurements
of
skeletons
verified
by
measurements
of
living
specimens
is
feet
ranging
from
feet
to
feet
the
average
height
of
the
females
measured
was
feet
ranging
from
feet
to
feet
referring
to
the
skulls
measured
by
him
he
says
that
relatively
they
are
large
as
is
always
the
case
among
people
of
small
size
the
measurements
of
the
ainos
by
scheube
as
given
by
dr
rein
are
average
height
of
males
feet
to
feet
and
of
females
feet
to
feet
which
do
not
differ
very
greatly
from
the
measurements
of
the
japanese
as
given
by
baelz
chapter
iii
myths
and
legends
the
art
of
writing
and
printing
was
not
introduced
into
japan
until
when
it
was
brought
from
china
up
to
that
time
therefore
no
written
accounts
existed
or
could
exist
of
the
early
history
of
the
country
oral
tradition
was
the
only
agency
by
which
a
knowledge
of
the
events
of
that
epoch
could
be
preserved
and
transmitted
that
such
a
method
of
preserving
history
is
uncertain
and
questionable
no
one
can
doubt
we
may
expect
to
find
therefore
in
the
accounts
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
those
centuries
which
transpired
before
written
records
were
introduced
much
that
is
contradictory
and
unintelligible
and
much
out
of
which
the
truth
can
be
gleaned
only
by
the
most
painstaking
research
the
oldest
book
of
japanese
history
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
called
or
of
ancient
this
work
was
undertaken
by
the
direction
of
the
emperor
temmu
who
became
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
collecting
the
ancient
traditions
which
were
still
extant
and
preserving
them
in
a
permanent
record
before
the
work
was
ended
the
emperor
died
and
for
years
the
collected
traditions
were
preserved
in
the
memory
of
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
empress
gemmyō
superintended
its
completion
and
it
was
finally
presented
to
the
court
in
by
a
comparison
of
this
work
with
or
of
which
was
completed
only
nine
years
after
the
other
we
are
convinced
that
the
era
of
chinese
classicism
had
not
yet
fallen
upon
the
country
the
style
of
the
older
book
is
a
purer
japanese
and
imparts
to
us
the
traditions
of
japanese
history
uncolored
by
chinese
philosophical
ideas
and
classic
pedantry
which
shortly
after
overwhelmed
japanese
literature
but
in
many
particulars
these
two
works
almost
equally
ancient
supplement
and
explain
each
other
the
events
given
in
the
two
are
in
most
respects
the
same
the
principal
difference
being
that
the
is
much
more
tinctured
with
chinese
philosophy
and
the
myths
concerning
the
creation
especially
show
the
influence
of
that
dual
system
which
had
been
introduced
to
give
a
philosophical
aspect
to
the
japanese
cosmogony
the
has
been
translated
into
english
to
which
have
been
added
a
valuable
introduction
and
notes
the
of
has
never
been
translated
entire
into
english
but
has
been
used
by
scholars
in
connection
with
the
among
the
japanese
it
has
always
been
more
highly
esteemed
than
the
perhaps
because
of
its
more
learned
and
classical
style
besides
these
two
historical
works
the
student
of
early
times
finds
his
chief
assistance
in
the
shintō
rituals
contained
in
a
work
called
of
ceremonial
they
have
been
in
part
translated
by
satow
who
for
many
years
was
the
learned
japanese
secretary
of
the
british
legation
and
who
read
two
papers
on
them
before
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
and
afterward
prepared
an
article
on
the
same
subject
for
the
it
will
be
apparent
from
these
circumstances
that
the
knowledge
of
the
earlier
events
indeed
of
all
preceding
the
ninth
century
must
be
derived
from
tradition
and
can
not
claim
the
same
certainty
as
when
based
on
contemporaneous
documents
not
only
the
whole
of
the
divine
age
but
the
reigns
of
the
emperors
from
jimmu
to
richū
must
be
reckoned
as
belonging
to
the
traditional
period
of
japanese
history
and
must
be
sifted
and
weighed
by
the
processes
of
reason
relying
on
the
narratives
of
the
and
the
japanese
scholars
have
constructed
a
table
of
the
emperors
which
has
been
accepted
by
the
great
mass
of
the
readers
both
foreign
and
native
it
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
names
of
these
early
emperors
their
ages
at
the
time
of
accession
and
at
the
time
of
death
and
the
length
of
reign
must
have
all
been
handed
down
by
tradition
during
almost
a
thousand
years
that
errors
and
uncertainties
should
have
crept
in
seems
inevitable
either
the
names
and
order
of
the
successive
emperors
or
the
length
of
time
during
which
they
reigned
would
be
liable
to
be
misstated
if
we
examine
the
list
of
emperors
we
find
that
the
ages
at
death
of
the
first
seventeen
beginning
with
jimmu
and
ending
with
nintoku
sum
up
years
with
an
average
of
years
for
each
the
age
of
jimmu
is
given
as
years
of
kōan
years
of
kōrei
years
of
keikō
years
of
nintoku
the
last
years
etc
then
suddenly
the
ages
of
the
emperors
from
richū
onward
drop
to
so
that
the
ages
of
the
seventeen
emperors
beginning
with
richū
have
an
average
of
only
years
this
reasonable
average
extends
down
through
the
long
series
to
the
present
time
it
is
plain
that
up
to
this
time
there
must
have
existed
a
different
system
of
reckoning
the
ages
than
that
which
pertained
afterwards
either
the
original
epoch
of
the
emperor
jimmu
has
been
rendered
more
remote
and
the
lives
of
the
emperors
have
been
prolonged
to
fill
up
the
space
or
if
we
assume
the
epoch
of
jimmu
to
be
correct
we
must
suppose
that
a
number
of
the
emperors
have
been
dropped
from
the
count
the
sudden
depression
in
the
ages
occurs
about
the
time
of
the
introduction
of
writing
from
china
which
occurred
in
wani
who
came
from
korea
to
japan
bringing
continental
culture
with
him
was
appointed
tutor
to
the
who
became
the
emperor
nintoku
during
his
and
subsequent
reigns
a
knowledge
of
chinese
writing
gradually
spread
so
that
the
annals
of
the
imperial
court
were
kept
in
regular
and
stated
order
this
will
account
without
difficulty
for
the
sudden
change
and
for
the
irregularity
of
the
early
chronology
notwithstanding
the
almost
absolute
certainty
of
error
which
exists
in
the
received
japanese
chronology
it
is
by
far
more
convenient
to
accept
it
in
the
form
it
is
presented
to
us
and
use
it
as
if
it
were
true
the
early
history
must
be
treated
as
traditional
and
only
the
later
period
from
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
can
be
accepted
as
in
any
sense
historical
yet
the
events
of
the
earlier
period
which
have
been
preserved
for
us
by
oral
tradition
are
capable
with
due
care
and
inspection
of
furnishing
important
lessons
and
disclosing
many
facts
in
regard
to
the
lives
and
characteristics
of
the
primitive
japanese
in
writing
the
history
of
rome
thomas
arnold
said
that
the
only
way
to
treat
its
early
history
was
to
give
the
early
legends
in
as
nearly
the
form
in
which
they
had
been
handed
down
as
possible
that
in
this
way
the
spirit
of
the
people
would
be
preserved
and
the
residuum
of
truth
in
them
would
become
the
heritage
of
the
present
generation
we
have
tried
to
treat
the
myths
and
legends
of
japanese
history
in
this
manner
and
have
given
the
principal
stories
as
they
are
preserved
among
the
japanese
origin
of
the
celestial
the
scene
opens
in
the
plain
of
high
heaven
when
heaven
and
earth
began
there
were
three
deities
in
existence
that
is
these
three
came
into
existence
without
creation
and
afterwards
died
then
two
other
deities
were
born
from
a
thing
that
sprouted
up
like
unto
a
reed
shoot
when
the
earth
young
and
like
unto
floating
oil
drifted
about
viz
these
two
deities
likewise
came
into
existence
without
creation
and
afterward
died
the
five
deities
above
named
are
called
the
heavenly
deities
next
were
born
these
two
deities
likewise
came
into
existence
without
creation
and
afterwards
died
next
were
born
and
and
and
and
and
or
izanagi
and
izanami
the
two
deities
named
above
together
with
these
five
pairs
are
called
the
seven
divine
generations
creation
of
the
japanese
then
the
heavenly
deities
gave
commandment
to
izanagi
and
izanami
to
make
consolidate
and
give
birth
to
this
drifting
land
for
their
divine
mission
they
received
a
heavenly
jewelled
spear
with
this
standing
on
the
floating
bridge
of
heaven
they
reached
down
and
stirred
the
brine
and
then
drew
up
the
spear
the
brine
that
dripped
from
the
end
of
the
spear
was
piled
up
and
became
the
island
of
onogoro
or
island
then
the
pair
descended
upon
this
island
and
erected
thereon
a
palace
eight
fathoms
long
here
they
lived
and
begat
successive
islands
the
first
was
the
island
of
hirugo
which
as
it
was
a
miscarriage
they
put
in
a
boat
of
bulrushes
and
let
it
float
away
the
second
was
the
island
of
awa
which
also
is
not
reckoned
among
their
offspring
the
next
was
the
island
of
awaji
and
the
next
the
land
of
iyo
by
which
is
understood
the
present
island
of
shikoku
so
in
succession
they
produced
the
islands
of
mitsugo
near
the
island
of
oki
the
island
of
tsukushi
which
is
now
called
kyūshū
the
island
of
iki
the
island
of
tsu
and
the
island
of
sado
and
lastly
the
which
is
supposed
to
mean
the
principal
island
named
in
these
pages
the
main
island
afterward
they
produced
kojima
in
kibi
ōshima
the
island
of
adzuki
the
island
of
hime
the
island
of
chika
and
the
islands
of
futago
thus
were
finished
the
labors
of
this
industrious
pair
in
producing
the
islands
of
japan
then
they
turned
to
the
duty
of
begetting
additional
deities
and
are
named
as
their
descendants
but
as
their
names
do
not
appear
in
the
record
of
subsequent
events
we
omit
them
here
finally
the
deity
of
fire
was
born
and
the
mother
in
giving
birth
to
this
child
died
and
departed
into
hades
izanagi
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
his
wife
s
death
the
tears
which
he
shed
turned
into
the
in
his
madness
he
drew
the
sabre
with
which
he
was
augustly
girded
and
cut
off
the
head
of
the
deity
of
fire
three
deities
were
born
from
the
blood
that
stuck
to
the
blade
three
were
born
from
the
blood
that
besprinkled
the
sword
guard
two
were
born
from
the
blood
which
oozed
out
through
his
fingers
as
they
grasped
the
hilt
and
eight
were
born
from
the
head
and
trunk
of
the
slaughtered
deity
into
then
izanagi
resolved
to
follow
his
spouse
into
the
land
of
hades
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
of
hades
she
came
out
to
meet
him
after
an
interview
with
him
she
went
back
to
seek
the
advice
of
the
deities
of
hades
to
her
impatient
husband
she
seemed
to
tarry
too
long
so
he
broke
off
the
of
the
comb
stuck
in
his
hair
and
kindling
it
as
a
torch
he
went
in
he
was
appalled
by
the
dreadful
pollution
of
the
place
and
by
the
loathsome
condition
of
his
spouse
he
fled
from
the
scene
followed
by
the
furious
guards
by
guile
and
by
force
however
he
escaped
and
came
again
to
the
upper
regions
of
then
izanagi
in
order
to
purify
himself
from
the
pollution
of
hades
came
to
a
small
stream
on
the
island
of
tsukushi
so
he
threw
down
the
august
staff
which
he
carried
and
it
became
a
deity
he
took
off
his
girdle
and
it
became
a
deity
he
threw
down
his
skirt
and
it
became
a
deity
and
he
took
off
his
upper
garment
and
it
became
a
deity
and
from
his
trousers
which
he
threw
down
there
was
born
a
deity
three
deities
were
born
from
the
bracelet
which
he
took
from
his
left
arm
and
three
from
the
bracelet
which
he
took
from
his
right
arm
thus
twelve
deities
were
born
from
the
things
which
he
took
off
then
he
found
that
the
waters
in
the
upper
reach
were
too
rapid
and
the
waters
in
the
lower
reach
were
too
sluggish
so
he
plunged
into
the
waters
of
the
middle
reach
and
as
he
washed
there
were
born
successive
deities
whose
names
it
is
not
needful
to
mention
but
when
he
washed
his
left
august
eye
there
was
born
from
it
the
or
as
she
is
often
called
the
sun
goddess
when
he
washed
his
right
august
eye
there
was
born
then
when
he
washed
his
august
nose
there
was
born
thus
fourteen
deities
were
born
from
his
bathing
all
these
deities
as
well
as
those
before
produced
seem
to
have
come
into
being
in
full
maturity
and
did
not
need
years
of
growth
to
develop
their
final
powers
izanagi
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
beauty
and
brilliancy
of
these
last
three
children
he
took
from
his
neck
his
august
necklace
and
gave
it
to
the
sun
goddess
saying
rule
thou
in
the
plains
of
high
heaven
then
he
gave
command
to
the
rule
thou
the
dominion
of
the
night
and
to
he
commanded
rule
thou
the
plain
of
the
sea
but
did
not
assume
command
of
his
domain
but
cried
and
wept
till
his
beard
reached
the
pit
of
his
stomach
then
izanagi
said
to
him
how
is
it
that
thou
dost
not
take
possession
of
thy
domain
but
dost
wail
and
weep
he
replied
i
weep
because
i
wish
to
go
to
my
mother
in
hades
then
izanagi
said
if
that
be
so
thou
shalt
not
dwell
in
this
land
so
he
expelled
him
with
a
divine
expulsion
whatever
that
may
mean
of
to
the
heavenly
then
said
i
will
first
take
leave
of
my
sister
who
rules
in
the
plains
of
heaven
when
the
sun
goddess
saw
her
brother
coming
she
put
jewels
in
her
hair
and
on
her
arms
slung
two
quivers
of
arrows
on
her
back
put
an
elbow
pad
upon
her
left
arm
and
brandishing
her
bow
she
went
out
to
meet
him
she
demanded
of
him
why
he
ascended
hither
then
he
replied
that
he
had
no
malicious
intentions
that
his
august
father
had
expelled
him
with
a
divine
expulsion
and
that
he
had
come
to
take
leave
of
her
before
departing
to
the
land
of
hades
thereupon
she
proposed
to
him
a
test
of
his
sincerity
they
stood
on
opposite
sides
of
the
tranquil
river
of
heaven
she
begged
him
to
reach
her
his
mighty
sabre
she
broke
it
into
three
pieces
and
crunched
the
pieces
in
her
mouth
and
blew
the
fragments
away
her
breath
and
the
fragments
which
she
blew
away
were
turned
into
three
female
deities
then
took
the
jewels
which
she
wore
in
her
hair
and
the
jewels
which
she
wore
in
her
and
the
jewels
she
wore
on
her
left
arm
and
the
jewels
she
wore
on
her
right
arm
and
crunched
them
and
blew
them
out
and
they
were
turned
into
five
male
deities
then
the
sun
goddess
declared
that
the
three
female
deities
which
were
produced
from
her
brother
s
sword
belonged
to
him
and
the
five
male
deities
which
were
produced
from
her
own
jewels
belonged
to
her
but
was
angry
at
this
decision
and
broke
down
the
fences
of
her
rice
fields
and
filled
up
the
water
sluices
and
defiled
her
garden
and
as
she
sat
with
her
maidens
in
the
weaving
hall
he
broke
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
dropped
upon
them
a
piebald
horse
which
he
had
flayed
with
a
backward
flaying
of
the
sun
then
the
sun
goddess
closed
the
door
of
the
cave
in
which
the
weaving
hall
was
and
the
whole
plain
of
heaven
and
the
were
darkened
and
night
prevailed
and
portents
of
woe
were
seen
on
every
hand
myriads
of
deities
assembled
in
the
bed
of
the
tranquil
river
of
heaven
and
besought
the
deity
child
of
the
the
second
of
the
original
trio
of
deities
to
propose
a
plan
for
inducing
the
sun
goddess
to
reappear
they
gathered
the
cocks
of
the
fowl
and
made
them
crow
they
wrought
a
metal
mirror
they
constructed
a
string
of
beautiful
jewels
they
performed
divination
with
the
of
a
stag
they
took
a
plant
of
sakaki
and
hung
on
its
branches
the
strings
of
jewels
the
mirror
and
offerings
of
peace
then
they
caused
the
rituals
to
be
recited
and
a
dance
to
be
danced
and
all
the
assembled
deities
laughed
aloud
the
sun
goddess
heard
these
sounds
of
merriment
and
was
amazed
she
softly
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
and
asked
the
meaning
of
all
this
tumult
they
told
her
it
was
because
they
had
found
another
goddess
more
illustrious
than
she
at
the
same
time
they
held
before
her
luminous
face
the
mirror
which
they
had
made
astonished
she
stepped
out
and
they
shut
and
fastened
the
door
behind
her
and
the
plain
of
heaven
and
the
became
light
again
then
the
assembled
deities
took
council
together
and
caused
to
be
punished
and
expelled
with
a
divine
expulsion
in
so
came
to
the
river
hi
in
izumo
and
he
found
there
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
and
a
young
girl
and
they
were
weeping
and
he
asked
them
why
they
wept
and
the
old
man
answered
i
once
had
eight
daughters
but
every
year
an
serpent
comes
and
devours
one
of
them
and
now
it
is
the
time
for
it
to
come
again
then
the
deity
said
wilt
thou
give
me
thy
daughter
if
i
save
her
from
the
serpent
and
he
eagerly
promised
her
then
the
deity
said
do
you
brew
eight
tubs
of
strong
and
set
each
on
a
platform
within
an
enclosure
so
they
brewed
and
set
the
according
to
his
bidding
then
the
serpent
came
and
putting
a
head
in
each
tub
drank
up
all
the
and
being
intoxicated
therewith
went
to
sleep
the
deity
then
with
his
sabre
hacked
the
serpent
in
pieces
and
the
blood
flowed
out
and
reddened
the
river
but
when
he
came
to
the
middle
tail
his
sabre
was
broken
and
when
he
searched
he
found
that
within
the
tail
was
a
great
sword
which
he
took
out
and
this
is
the
then
built
for
himself
a
palace
and
dwelt
there
with
his
wife
and
made
the
old
man
the
master
of
his
palace
here
follows
a
line
of
legends
relating
to
the
deities
of
the
land
of
izumo
which
do
not
concern
particularly
our
story
except
that
they
show
that
izumo
was
closely
connected
with
the
early
migrations
from
the
continent
it
must
be
remembered
that
izumo
lies
almost
directly
opposite
to
korea
and
that
this
would
be
a
natural
point
to
which
the
nomadic
tribes
of
asia
would
turn
in
seeking
for
new
fields
in
which
to
settle
for
pacifying
the
then
the
heavenly
deities
consulted
together
how
they
might
pacify
the
lands
of
japan
they
sent
down
one
of
their
number
to
report
on
its
condition
but
he
went
no
farther
than
the
floating
bridge
of
heaven
and
seeing
the
violence
which
prevailed
he
returned
then
they
sent
another
but
he
made
friends
with
the
insurgent
deities
and
brought
back
no
report
again
they
sent
an
envoy
who
married
the
daughter
of
the
insurgent
deity
and
for
eight
years
sent
back
no
report
after
this
they
sent
a
pheasant
down
to
inquire
why
a
report
was
not
sent
this
bird
perched
on
a
cassia
tree
at
the
palace
gate
of
the
delinquent
envoy
and
he
hearing
its
mournful
croaking
shot
it
with
an
arrow
which
flew
up
through
the
ether
and
landed
in
the
plains
of
heaven
the
arrow
was
shot
down
again
and
killed
the
envoy
finally
two
other
envoys
were
sent
down
who
landed
in
izumo
and
after
some
parley
with
the
refractory
deities
of
the
land
received
their
adhesion
and
settled
and
pacified
the
land
then
they
returned
to
the
heavenly
plains
and
reported
that
peace
was
established
of
the
august
the
being
now
reported
as
peaceful
the
heavenly
deities
sent
who
was
a
grandson
of
to
dwell
in
and
rule
over
it
there
were
joined
to
him
in
this
mission
the
as
his
vanguard
and
five
chiefs
of
companies
they
gave
him
also
the
string
of
jewels
and
the
mirror
with
which
the
sun
goddess
had
been
allured
from
the
cave
and
also
the
which
had
taken
from
the
tail
of
the
serpent
and
they
charged
him
saying
regard
this
mirror
precisely
as
if
it
were
our
august
spirit
and
reverence
it
as
if
reverencing
us
then
taking
leave
of
the
plains
of
heaven
and
pushing
asunder
the
heavenly
spreading
clouds
descended
upon
the
peak
of
takachiho
in
tsukushi
a
mountain
which
is
still
pointed
out
in
the
present
island
of
kyūshū
and
noting
that
the
place
was
an
exceedingly
good
country
he
built
for
himself
a
palace
and
dwelt
there
and
he
married
a
wife
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
deity
of
the
place
who
bore
him
three
sons
whom
he
named
prince
prince
and
prince
and
now
prince
was
a
notable
fisherman
and
prince
was
a
hunter
and
prince
said
unto
his
elder
brother
let
us
exchange
our
occupations
and
try
our
luck
and
after
some
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
elder
brother
the
exchange
was
made
but
prince
was
not
successful
and
lost
the
in
the
sea
then
prince
proposed
to
his
younger
brother
to
exchange
back
the
implements
which
they
had
used
but
the
younger
brother
said
he
had
had
no
luck
and
had
lost
the
hook
in
the
sea
but
prince
was
angry
and
demanded
his
hook
then
prince
broke
his
sword
into
many
fragments
and
made
them
into
which
he
gave
to
his
brother
in
place
of
the
one
he
had
lost
but
he
would
not
receive
them
then
he
made
a
thousand
and
offered
these
but
he
said
i
want
my
original
hook
and
as
prince
was
weeping
by
the
sea
shore
the
deity
came
to
him
and
asked
him
why
he
wept
he
replied
i
have
exchanged
a
with
my
elder
brother
and
have
lost
it
and
he
will
not
be
satisfied
with
any
compensation
i
can
make
but
demands
the
original
hook
then
the
deity
built
a
boat
and
set
him
in
it
and
said
to
him
sail
on
in
this
boat
along
this
way
and
you
will
come
to
a
palace
built
of
fishes
scales
it
is
the
palace
of
the
deity
there
will
be
a
cassia
tree
by
the
well
near
the
palace
go
and
sit
in
the
top
of
that
tree
and
the
daughter
of
the
will
come
to
thee
and
tell
thee
what
to
do
so
he
sailed
away
in
the
boat
and
came
to
the
palace
of
the
and
he
climbed
the
cassia
tree
and
sat
there
and
the
maidens
of
the
daughter
of
the
sea
deity
came
out
to
draw
water
and
saw
the
beautiful
young
man
sitting
in
the
tree
then
he
asked
them
for
some
water
and
they
drew
water
and
gave
it
to
him
in
a
jewelled
cup
without
drinking
from
it
he
took
the
jewel
from
his
neck
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
spat
it
into
the
vessel
and
it
clung
to
the
vessel
so
the
maidens
took
the
vessel
and
the
jewel
clinging
to
it
into
the
palace
to
their
mistress
and
they
told
her
that
a
beautiful
young
man
was
sitting
in
the
cassia
tree
by
the
well
the
sea
deity
then
went
out
himself
and
recognized
the
young
man
as
prince
he
brought
him
into
the
palace
spread
rugs
for
him
to
sit
on
and
made
a
banquet
for
him
he
gave
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
he
abode
there
three
years
at
last
one
morning
his
daughter
reported
to
the
sea
deity
that
prince
although
he
had
passed
three
years
without
a
sigh
yet
last
night
he
had
heaved
one
deep
sigh
the
sea
deity
asked
him
why
he
sighed
then
prince
told
him
about
his
difficulty
with
his
brother
and
how
he
would
accept
no
compensation
for
his
lost
but
demanded
the
return
of
the
original
thereupon
the
sea
deity
summoned
together
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
and
asked
them
if
any
one
of
them
had
swallowed
this
hook
and
all
the
fishes
said
that
the
had
complained
of
something
sticking
in
its
throat
and
doubtless
that
was
the
lost
hook
the
throat
of
the
therefore
being
examined
the
hook
was
found
and
given
to
prince
then
the
sea
deity
dismissed
him
to
his
own
country
and
gave
him
two
jewels
a
jewel
and
an
jewel
and
he
set
him
on
the
head
of
an
immense
crocodile
and
bade
the
crocodile
convey
him
carefully
and
come
back
and
make
a
report
and
prince
gave
the
recovered
hook
to
his
brother
but
a
spirit
of
animosity
still
dwelt
in
his
heart
and
he
tried
to
kill
his
brother
then
prince
threw
out
the
jewel
and
the
tide
came
in
upon
the
prince
and
was
about
to
drown
him
and
he
cried
out
to
his
brother
and
expressed
his
repentance
then
prince
threw
out
the
jewel
and
the
tide
flowed
back
and
left
him
safe
then
prince
bowed
his
head
before
his
younger
brother
and
said
henceforth
i
will
be
thy
guard
by
day
and
night
and
will
faithfully
serve
thee
and
succeeded
his
father
and
dwelt
in
the
palace
of
takachiho
five
hundred
and
eighty
years
the
place
of
his
tomb
is
still
shown
on
mount
takachiho
in
the
province
of
hyūga
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
and
he
left
as
his
successor
his
son
whom
the
daughter
of
the
sea
deity
had
borne
him
and
this
son
was
the
father
of
who
is
known
to
posterity
by
his
canonical
name
of
jimmu
the
first
emperor
of
japan
chapter
iv
founding
the
empire
we
have
now
come
to
the
time
when
the
movements
which
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
the
empire
of
japan
took
place
the
events
are
still
overlaid
with
myth
and
legend
which
could
only
have
been
transmitted
by
oral
tradition
but
they
have
to
do
with
characters
and
places
which
are
tied
to
the
present
by
stronger
cords
than
those
of
the
divine
age
what
the
events
really
were
which
are
involved
in
the
myths
of
the
preceding
chapter
it
is
impossible
to
predicate
that
the
celestial
invasion
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
means
the
coming
thither
of
a
chief
and
his
followers
from
the
continent
by
way
of
korea
seems
most
reasonable
the
of
izumo
with
these
legends
may
mean
that
another
migration
of
a
kindred
race
took
place
to
that
part
of
the
main
island
the
easy
access
to
both
izumo
and
kyūshū
from
korea
makes
these
migrations
the
natural
explanation
of
the
landing
of
the
japanese
upon
these
fertile
and
tempting
islands
without
settling
the
difficult
ethnographical
questions
which
are
involved
in
this
problem
we
propose
to
follow
the
kyūshū
invaders
into
the
main
island
we
will
note
the
slow
and
laborious
steps
by
which
they
proceeded
to
establish
a
government
which
through
many
changes
and
emergencies
continues
to
this
day
the
prince
whom
we
will
continue
to
call
jimmu
had
an
elder
brother
prince
who
seems
however
to
have
been
less
active
and
energetic
than
the
younger
at
least
even
from
the
first
it
is
prince
jimmu
who
is
represented
as
taking
the
initiative
in
the
movements
which
were
now
begun
the
two
brothers
consulted
together
and
resolved
to
conduct
an
expedition
towards
the
east
it
will
be
remembered
that
their
grandfather
had
established
his
palace
on
mount
takachiho
which
is
one
of
the
two
highest
peaks
in
kyūshū
situated
in
the
province
of
hyūga
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
southern
extension
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
it
was
from
this
place
that
the
two
brothers
started
on
their
expedition
it
was
no
doubt
such
an
expedition
as
the
norse
vikings
of
a
later
day
often
led
into
the
islands
of
their
neighbors
they
had
with
them
a
force
composed
of
the
descendants
of
the
invaders
who
had
come
with
their
grandfather
from
the
continent
they
marched
first
through
the
country
called
toyo
which
was
a
luxuriant
and
fertile
region
on
the
northeast
part
of
the
island
thence
they
marched
to
the
palace
of
wokada
situated
in
a
district
of
the
island
of
tsukushi
lying
on
the
northwest
coast
facing
tsushima
and
the
peninsula
of
korea
and
bordering
on
the
straits
of
the
inland
sea
here
they
remained
a
year
and
probably
built
the
boats
by
which
they
crossed
the
inland
sea
from
tsukushi
they
crossed
to
the
province
of
aki
in
the
main
island
on
the
coast
of
the
inland
sea
where
it
is
said
they
remained
seven
years
the
progress
seems
like
that
of
the
hordes
of
the
goths
in
the
early
ages
of
european
history
it
was
not
merely
a
military
expedition
but
a
migration
of
a
tribe
with
all
its
belongings
women
and
children
old
men
and
old
women
and
household
and
agricultural
effects
the
military
band
under
prince
jimmu
and
his
brother
formed
the
vanguard
and
protection
of
the
tribe
during
their
seven
years
sojourn
in
aki
they
were
compelled
to
resort
to
agriculture
as
well
as
fishing
for
their
support
then
they
skirted
along
the
north
coast
of
the
inland
sea
to
takashima
in
the
province
of
kibi
thence
they
crept
with
their
awkward
boats
eastward
among
the
luxuriant
islands
they
met
a
native
of
the
coast
out
in
his
boat
fishing
and
engaged
his
services
as
a
guide
he
conducted
them
to
naniwa
which
now
bears
the
name
of
ōsaka
where
they
encountered
the
swift
tides
and
rough
sea
which
navigators
still
meet
in
this
place
finally
they
landed
at
a
point
which
we
can
not
recognize
but
which
must
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of
ōsaka
at
the
mouth
of
the
yodo
river
here
their
conflicts
with
the
natives
began
the
whole
region
seems
to
have
been
occupied
by
tribes
not
unlike
their
own
who
had
probably
come
thither
from
the
settlements
in
izumo
the
first
to
dispute
their
progress
was
prince
nagasuné
long
legs
of
tomi
who
raised
an
army
and
resisted
the
landing
of
the
invaders
it
was
in
the
battle
that
ensued
at
this
place
that
prince
the
elder
brother
received
a
wound
in
his
hand
from
an
arrow
shot
by
prince
nagasuné
the
reason
given
reveals
a
curious
superstition
which
seems
to
have
prevailed
from
this
early
time
the
japanese
prince
on
receiving
the
wound
exclaims
it
is
not
right
for
me
an
august
child
of
the
sun
goddess
to
fight
facing
the
sun
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
am
stricken
by
the
wretched
villain
s
hurtful
prince
after
a
few
days
died
from
the
effects
of
the
wound
he
is
buried
on
mount
kama
in
the
province
of
kii
it
is
needless
to
recount
all
the
legends
which
cluster
around
this
invasion
of
the
central
provinces
of
japan
about
the
wild
boar
which
came
out
of
the
mountains
near
kumano
before
which
prince
jimmu
and
all
his
warriors
fell
down
in
a
faint
about
the
miraculous
sword
which
was
sent
down
from
the
heavenly
plains
to
aid
him
in
subduing
the
about
a
crow
eight
feet
long
which
was
sent
to
guide
him
in
his
expedition
and
about
the
deities
with
tails
who
in
several
places
were
encountered
to
our
conception
they
seem
meaningless
and
do
not
in
any
measure
contribute
to
the
progress
of
the
story
they
bear
evidence
of
a
later
invention
and
do
not
belong
legitimately
to
the
narrative
at
uda
on
the
east
coast
of
the
yamato
peninsula
there
lived
two
brothers
named
ukashi
the
elder
brother
undertook
to
deceive
prince
jimmu
and
set
a
trap
in
which
to
capture
and
slay
him
but
the
younger
brother
revealed
the
plot
whereupon
the
followers
of
prince
jimmu
compelled
the
traitor
to
retreat
into
his
own
trap
where
they
killed
him
the
younger
brother
was
honored
and
rewarded
by
jimmu
and
appears
afterward
among
the
hereditary
princes
of
the
country
again
as
he
was
making
his
progress
through
the
country
prince
jimmu
came
upon
a
company
of
the
savages
known
as
whom
the
calls
and
describes
them
as
having
tails
there
appear
to
have
existed
at
this
period
remnants
of
these
tribes
as
far
south
as
the
parallel
at
a
later
period
they
were
driven
out
by
the
ainos
and
nothing
but
some
of
their
relics
now
exists
even
in
yezo
the
peculiarity
by
which
they
were
known
was
that
they
lived
in
a
sort
of
pit
dug
out
of
the
earth
in
the
sides
of
the
mountains
over
which
they
built
a
roof
of
limbs
and
grass
in
the
present
case
there
were
eighty
of
the
warriors
of
this
tribe
prince
jimmu
made
a
banquet
for
them
in
one
of
their
pits
and
assigned
an
equal
number
of
his
own
men
to
act
as
attendants
each
of
these
attendants
was
girded
with
a
sword
then
from
a
post
outside
he
sang
a
song
and
at
a
given
signal
in
this
song
the
eighty
attendants
fell
upon
the
eighty
and
slew
them
all
thus
having
subdued
all
opposing
forces
and
brought
the
country
into
subjection
prince
jimmu
established
himself
in
a
palace
built
for
him
at
kashiwara
in
the
province
of
yamato
this
is
usually
regarded
by
japanese
historians
as
the
beginning
of
the
empire
and
the
present
era
is
reckoned
from
this
establishment
of
a
capital
in
yamato
from
the
record
of
the
length
of
the
reigns
of
the
several
emperors
contained
in
the
and
the
and
later
books
the
date
of
the
accession
of
the
emperor
jimmu
is
fixed
at
we
have
given
elsewhere
our
reason
for
believing
the
record
of
the
early
reigns
of
doubtful
authenticity
nevertheless
as
it
is
impossible
to
propose
a
definite
change
it
is
better
to
use
the
accepted
scheme
with
its
admitted
defects
the
emperor
jimmu
after
his
accession
continued
to
reign
years
and
according
to
the
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
the
however
gives
his
age
at
death
as
one
hundred
and
and
this
has
been
adopted
by
the
government
in
its
published
chronology
his
burial
place
is
said
to
be
on
the
northern
side
of
mount
unebi
in
the
province
of
yamato
it
is
just
to
assign
to
the
emperor
jimmu
the
exalted
place
which
the
japanese
claim
for
him
in
their
history
that
he
was
a
prince
of
high
enterprise
is
evident
from
his
adventurous
expedition
from
the
home
of
his
family
into
the
barbarous
and
unknown
regions
of
the
main
island
he
accomplished
its
conquest
with
less
slaughter
and
cruelty
than
the
customs
of
the
times
seemed
to
justify
he
made
it
his
policy
to
effect
terms
with
the
native
princes
and
seek
their
in
his
government
he
extended
his
sway
so
that
it
covered
anato
now
known
as
nagato
and
izumo
on
the
west
and
reached
probably
to
owari
on
the
east
all
this
time
he
had
held
a
firm
hand
on
the
island
from
which
he
had
come
so
that
few
if
any
outbreaks
occurred
among
its
restless
turanian
or
native
inhabitants
the
emperor
jimmu
was
succeeded
by
his
third
son
known
by
his
canonical
name
as
the
emperor
suizei
the
reigning
emperor
it
seems
exercised
the
right
to
select
the
son
who
should
succeed
him
this
was
not
always
the
oldest
son
but
from
the
time
he
was
chosen
he
was
known
as
which
is
nearly
equivalent
to
the
english
term
crown
prince
the
emperor
suizei
it
is
said
occupied
a
palace
at
takaoka
in
kazuraki
in
the
province
of
yamato
this
palace
was
not
far
from
that
occupied
by
his
father
yet
it
was
not
the
same
and
in
the
reigns
of
the
successive
sovereigns
down
to
when
the
capital
was
for
a
time
established
at
nara
we
observe
it
as
a
most
singular
circumstance
that
each
new
emperor
resided
in
a
new
palace
in
the
first
place
the
palace
spoken
of
in
these
early
times
was
probably
a
very
simple
structure
satow
in
his
paper
on
the
temples
at
isé
gives
an
account
of
the
form
and
construction
of
the
prehistoric
japanese
house
the
shintō
temple
in
its
pure
form
is
probably
a
survival
of
the
original
palace
before
the
introduction
of
of
iron
and
boring
implements
or
nails
the
building
must
have
been
constructed
in
a
very
primitive
fashion
it
will
be
understood
that
stone
or
brick
were
never
used
wood
was
the
only
material
for
the
frame
the
roof
was
thatched
with
rushes
or
rice
straw
the
pure
shintō
temples
of
modern
times
are
built
with
the
utmost
simplicity
and
plainness
although
the
occasion
for
adhering
to
primitive
methods
has
long
since
passed
away
yet
the
buildings
are
conformed
to
the
styles
of
structure
necessary
before
the
introduction
of
modern
tools
and
appliances
to
build
a
new
palace
therefore
for
a
new
emperor
involved
by
no
means
such
an
outlay
of
time
and
work
as
might
be
imagined
it
is
not
improbable
that
when
a
young
man
was
chosen
crown
prince
he
had
an
establishment
of
his
own
assigned
to
him
and
this
became
his
palace
which
he
occupied
when
he
became
emperor
when
a
man
died
and
especially
when
an
emperor
died
it
was
an
ancient
custom
to
abandon
his
abode
it
became
unclean
by
the
presence
in
it
of
a
dead
body
and
therefore
was
no
longer
used

it
is
narrated
that
during
his
reign
a
pestilence
broke
out
which
was
so
severe
that
the
country
was
almost
depopulated
the
emperor
was
greatly
disturbed
by
this
calamity
and
there
appeared
to
him
in

night
a
divine
vision
the
great
deity
the
great
master

appeared

revealed
to

worship
was

ordained

forthwith
abated

expeditions
were
also
sent
into
the
northwestern
and
northeastern
districts
of
the
main
island
to
repress
the
disturbances
which
had
arisen
the
reports
from
these
expeditions
were
in
each
case
favorable
and
the
whole
empire
was
in
a
condition
of
quiet
and
prosperity
such
as
had
not
before
existed
taxes
were
for
the

for
the

provinces
and
encouragement
was
everywhere
given
to
the
growing
industries
of
the
country
the
emperor
sūjin
was
succeeded
by
his
younger
son
who
is
known
as
the
eleventh
emperor
under
the
name
of
suinin
he
is
said
to
have
reigned
years
and
to
have
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
a
conspiracy
came
near
ending
the
life
of
this
emperor
a
brother
of
the
empress
was
ambitious
to
attain
supreme
authority
he
approached
his
sister
with
the
subtle
question
which
is
dearer
to
thee
thine
elder
brother
or
thy
husband
she
replied
my
elder
brother
is
dearer
then
he
said
if
i
be
truly
the
dearer
to
thee
let
me
and
thee
rule
the
empire
and
he
gave
her
a
finely
tempered
dagger
and
said
to
her
slay
the
emperor
with
this
in
his
sleep
so
the
emperor
unconscious
of
danger
was
sleeping
one
day
with
his
head
on
the
lap
of
the
empress
and
she
thinking
the
time
had
come
was
about
to
strike
him
with
the
dagger
but
her
courage
failed
her
and
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
on
the
face
of
the
sleeping
emperor
he
started
up
awakened
by
the
falling
tears
and
said
to
her
i
have
had
a
strange
dream
a
violent
shower
came
up
from
the
direction
of
saho
and
suddenly
wet
my
face
and
a
small
snake
coiled
itself
around
my
neck
what
can
such
a
dream
betoken
then
the
empress
confessed
the
conspiracy
with
her
brother
the
emperor
knowing
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
immediately
collected
a
force
of
troops
and
marched
against
his
he
had
entrenched
himself
behind
palisades
of
timber
and
awaited
the
emperor
s
attack
the
empress
hesitating
between
her
brother
and
her
husband
had
made
her
escape
to
her
brother
s
palace
at
this
terrible
juncture
she
was
delivered
of
a
child
she
brought
the
child
to
the
palisades
in
sight
of
the
emperor
and
cried
out
to
him
to
take
it
under
his
care
he
was
deeply
moved
by
her
appeal
to
him
and
forthwith
planned
to
rescue
both
the
child
and
its
mother
he
chose
from
among
his
warriors
a
band
of
the
bravest
and
most
cunning
and
commanded
them
saying
when
ye
go
to
take
the
child
be
sure
that
ye
seize
also
the
mother
but
she
fearing
that
the
soldiers
would
try
to
snatch
her
when
they
came
for
the
child
shaved
off
her
hair
and
covered
her
head
with
the
loose
hair
as
if
it
were
still
adhering
and
she
made
the
around
her
neck
and
arms
rotten
and
she
rendered
her
garments
by
which
they
might
catch
hold
of
her
tender
by
soaking
them
in
when
the
soldiers
came
to
her
she
gave
them
the
child
and
fled
then
they
seized
her
by
the
hair
and
it
came
away
in
their
hands
and
they
clutched
at
the
and
they
broke
and
then
they
grasped
her
garments
but
they
had
been
rendered
tender
and
gave
way
in
their
hands
so
she
escaped
from
them
and
fled
then
they
went
back
to
the
emperor
and
reported
that
they
had
been
unable
to
capture
the
mother
but
they
had
brought
the
babe
the
emperor
was
angry
at
what
the
soldiers
told
him
he
was
angry
at
the
jewellers
who
had
made
the
rotten
and
deprived
them
of
their
lands
he
called
to
the
empress
through
the
burning
palisades
around
the
the
soldiers
had
set
fire
to
the
a
child
s
name
must
be
given
by
its
mother
what
shall
be
the
name
of
this
child
and
she
answered
let
it
be
called
prince
and
again
he
called
how
shall
he
be
reared
she
replied
take
for
him
a
and
bathing
woman
who
shall
care
for
him
then
he
asked
again
saying
who
shall
loosen
the
small
fresh
pendant
which
you
have
tied
upon
him
and
she
gave
directions
concerning
this
also
then
the
emperor
paused
no
longer
but
slew
the
rebellious
prince
in
his
burning
palace
and
the
empress
perished
with
her
wicked
brother
following
this
is
a
long
legend
concerning
this
child
which
was
dumb
from
its
birth
and
how
he
was
sent
to
worship
at
the
temple
of
the
deities
of
izumo
and
how
he
miraculously
attained
the
power
of
speech
and
was
brought
back
to
his
father
it
was
during
the
reign
of
this
emperor
also
that
was
sent
to
china
to
fetch
specimens
of
the
for
introduction
into
japan
he
returned
with
them
but
when
he
reached
the
capital
the
emperor
was
dead
the
messenger
was
shocked
and
brought
the
specimens
of
the
to
the
burial
place
of
the
emperor
where
he
died
from
grief
up
to
this
time
it
seems
to
have
been
the
cruel
custom
to
bury
with
the
deceased
members
of
the
imperial
family
and
perhaps
with
others
of
high
rank
the
living
retainers
and
horses
who
had
been
in
their
service
it
is
said
that
when
the
emperor
s
younger
brother
died
they
buried
along
with
him
his
living
retainers
placing
them
upright
in
a
circle
around
him
and
leaving
their
heads
uncovered
night
and
day
were
heard
the
agonizing
cries
of
these
thus
left
to
die
of
starvation
the
emperor
was
greatly
moved
and
resolved
that
this
terrible
custom
should
be
abolished
four
years
later
the
empress
herself
died
and
the
emperor
called
together
his
counsellors
to
propose
some
plan
by
which
this
practice
of
living
sacrifices
could
be
avoided
thereupon
one
of
his
counsellors
advanced
and
begged
the
emperor
to
listen
to
a
scheme
which
he
had
to
present
he
suggested
that
instead
of
burying
the
living
retainers
with
their
master
or
mistress
clay
images
of
men
and
women
and
horses
be
set
up
in
a
circle
around
the
burial
place
the
plan
pleased
the
emperor
vastly
and
images
were
at
once
made
and
buried
around
the
dead
empress
as
a
mark
of
his
high
appreciation
was
appointed
chief
of
the
guild
it
appears
probable
that
this
cruel
usage
of
burying
living
retainers
with
their
dead
master
was
not
entirely
ended
by
this
substitution
of
clay
images
as
late
as
the
emperor
found
it
necessary
to
prescribe
regulations
for
funerals
and
to
forbid
the
burial
of
living
retainers
satow
has
given
a
most
interesting
account
of
this
edict
which
pertains
not
only
to
the
practice
of
burial
of
retainers
but
also
to
the
size
of
vaults
and
mounds
and
the
number
of
laborers
who
might
be
employed
in
preparing
the
structure
the
images
used
as
a
substitute
for
living
retainers
were
called
clay
images
they
have
been
found
in
many
parts
of
the
country
especially
in
the
home
provinces
where
the
burial
of
the
imperial
families
and
the
connected
nobility
took
place
this
burying
of
images
seems
to
have
died
out
about
its
discontinuance
probably
was
owing
to
the
growing
prevalence
of
buddhism
which
discountenanced
a
custom
founded
on
a
religion
anterior
to
it
illustration
buried
images
the
emperor
suinin
was
succeeded
by
his
younger
son
keikō
who
became
the
twelfth
emperor
he
reigned
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
his
son
prince
who
afterward
was
known
as
is
represented
as
pursuing
a
most
daring
and
romantic
career
the
myths
concerning
him
are
among
the
most
picturesque
in
japanese
history
the
first
adventure
narrated
of
him
was
regarding
his
elder
brother
his
father
asked
him
why
does
not
thy
elder
brother
make
his
appearance
at
the
imperial
banquets
do
thou
see
after
this
and
teach
him
his
duty
a
few
days
after
his
father
said
again
to
him
why
dost
not
thy
brother
attend
to
his
duty
hast
thou
not
warned
him
as
i
bade
thee
the
young
prince
replied
that
he
had
taken
that
trouble
then
his
father
said
how
didst
thou
take
the
trouble
to
warn
him
and
the
prince
coolly
told
him
that
he
had
slain
him
and
thrown
his
carcass
away
the
emperor
was
alarmed
at
the
coolness
and
ferocity
of
his
son
and
bethought
how
he
might
employ
him
advantageously
now
there
were
at
kumaso
in
kyūshū
two
brothers
fierce
and
rebellious
bandits
who
paid
small
respect
to
the
imperial
wishes
the
emperor
conceived
that
it
would
be
a
fitting
achievement
for
his
fearless
son
to
put
an
end
to
these
reckless
outlaws
so
borrowed
from
his
aunt
her
female
apparel
and
hiding
a
sword
in
the
bosom
of
his
dress
he
sought
out
the
two
outlaws
in
their
they
were
about
to
celebrate
the
occupancy
of
a
new
cave
which
they
had
fitted
up
for
themselves
they
had
invited
a
goodly
number
of
their
neighbors
and
especially
of
the
female
sex
prince
who
was
young
and
put
on
his
female
disguise
and
let
down
his
hair
which
was
still
long
he
sauntered
about
the
cave
and
went
in
where
the
two
outlaws
were
amusing
themselves
with
their
female
visitors
they
were
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
this
new
and
beautiful
face
they
seated
her
between
them
and
did
their
best
to
entertain
her
suddenly
when
the
outlaws
were
off
their
guard
he
drew
his
sword
from
his
bosom
and
slew
the
elder
brother
the
younger
rushed
out
of
the
door
of
the
cave
the
prince
close
at
his
heels
with
one
hand
he
clutched
him
by
the
back
and
with
the
other
thrust
him
through
with
his
sword
as
he
fell
he
begged
the
prince
to
pause
a
moment
and
not
to
withdraw
his
sword
from
his
fatal
wound
then
the
outlaw
said
who
art
thou
and
he
told
him
and
for
what
purpose
he
had
come
the
outlaw
said
there
were
in
the
west
none
so
brave
as
we
two
brothers
from
this
time
forward
it
shall
be
right
to
praise
thee
as
the
august
child
the
bravest
in
yamato
as
soon
as
he
had
said
this
the
prince
ripped
him
up
like
a
ripe
then
after
he
had
subdued
and
pacified
the
rebellious
princes
of
the
districts
about
the
straits
of
shimonoseki
he
returned
to
the
emperor
and
made
his
report
following
this
account
of
s
adventures
in
the
west
there
are
given
the
interesting
traditions
concerning
his
expedition
to
the
east
and
his
encounters
with
the
ainos
who
inhabited
the
northern
part
of
the
island
that
there
was
a
basis
of
fact
to
these
traditions
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
yet
the
events
have
such
an
air
of
fable
and
poetry
that
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
fact
from
the
legend
as
we
have
done
in
previous
instances
we
give
the
stories
in
their
essential
entirety
leaving
to
scholars
hereafter
the
task
of
winnowing
the
grains
of
fact
out
of
the
chaff
which
the
imagination
of
the
race
has
left
for
us
prince
took
on
his
expedition
to
the
east
the
prince
the
emperor
gave
him
these
instructions
subdue
and
pacify
the
savage
deities
and
likewise
the
unsubmissive
people
of
the
twelve
roads
of
the
prince
first
visited
the
temple
of
the
sun
goddess
in
isé
where
he
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
his
great
ancestress
he
must
have
had
a
presentiment
that
he
never
would
return
alive
from
this
expedition
his
aunt
who
was
the
priestess
of
this
temple
gave
him
on
his
departure
the
sword
which
the
discovered
in
the
tail
of
the
snake
which
he
slew
in
izumo
she
also
gave
him
a
bag
which
he
was
not
to
open
until
he
found
himself
in
pressing
difficulty
he
came
to
the
land
of
owari
and
appears
there
to
have
been
smitten
by
the
charms
of
the
princess
miyazu
and
planning
to
wed
her
on
his
way
back
he
plighted
to
her
his
troth
and
went
on
then
he
came
to
the
province
of
sagami
where
he
met
the
chief
of
the
land
but
he
deceived
him
and
said
that
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
moor
there
is
a
lagoon
where
lives
a
deity
went
over
the
moor
to
find
the
deity
whereupon
the
chief
set
fire
to
the
grass
expecting
to
see
him
consumed
but
seeing
his
danger
and
being
assured
that
the
time
of
pressing
difficulty
had
come
opened
the
bag
which
his
aunt
had
given
him
there
he
found
a
fire
drill
with
which
a
fire
could
be
struck
he
cut
away
the
grass
around
him
with
the
sword
which
had
been
given
him
and
then
set
fire
to
the
moor
when
he
was
safe
from
the
fire
he
sought
out
and
slew
the
traitorous
chief
and
all
the
chiefs
who
were
associated
with
him
from
sagami
he
undertook
to
cross
in
a
boat
the
waters
of
yedo
bay
to
kazusa
opposite
but
the
sea
was
rough
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
being
overwhelmed
and
drowned
then
his
wife
the
princess
who
accompanied
him
on
this
expedition
threw
out
mats
from
the
boat
and
saying
i
will
enter
the
sea
instead
of
the
prince
you
must
finish
the
task
on
which
you
are
sent
she
sprang
from
the
boat
and
sat
down
on
the
mats
she
had
thrown
out
immediately
the
waves
were
quiet
and
the
boat
sailed
on
in
safety
and
the
comb
of
the
princess
was
washed
ashore
and
the
people
built
for
it
a
sacred
mausoleum
in
which
it
was
kept
then
prince
penetrated
the
regions
occupied
by
the
ainos
and
subdued
them
having
accomplished
this
principal
object
of
his
undertaking
he
returned
by
way
of
the
usui
pass
opposite
to
mount
fuji
as
he
stood
in
this
lofty
position
and
looked
out
on
the
sea
where
his
wife
had
sacrificed
herself
for
his
safety
he
cried
out
azuma
ha
ya
o
my
wife
azuma
is
a
name
often
used
in
poetry
for
the
part
of
japan
north
of
this
pass
but
whether
this
myth
was
invented
to
explain
the
name
or
the
name
was
derived
from
the
incident
it
is
impossible
to
determine
then
prince
went
into
the
high
lands
of
shinano
and
after
he
had
settled
the
disturbances
which
existed
there
he
came
back
to
owari
where
he
had
left
the
princess
miyazu
in
one
of
his
excursions
into
the
rebellious
regions
he
was
stricken
with
a
fatal
illness
in
his
enfeebled
condition
he
struggled
on
almost
unable
to
walk
he
made
his
way
towards
isé
at
ōtsu
a
village
on
the
coast
of
owari
bay
he
recovered
the
sword
which
he
had
left
on
his
way
to
the
east
in
his
painful
journey
he
sat
down
under
a
pine
tree
the
spirit
of
poesy
even
in
his
pain
came
upon
him
and
he
sang
this
little
poem
in
praise
of
the
pine
tree
o
mine
elder
brother
the
single
pine
tree
that
art
on
cape
ōtsu
which
directly
faces
owari
if
thou
single
pine
tree
wert
a
person
i
would
gird
my
sword
upon
thee
i
would
clothe
thee
with
my
garments
o
mine
elder
brother
the
single
pine
tree
he
went
on
a
little
farther
to
nobono
and
his
sickness
became
more
serious
and
there
in
the
open
fields
he
felt
that
his
end
had
come
he
sent
the
spoils
of
his
expedition
to
the
temple
of
his
great
ancestress
the
sun
goddess
he
sent
his
faithful
companion
prince
to
the
emperor
to
carry
his
last
message
it
was
i
have
chastised
the
eastern
barbarians
according
to
your
imperial
order
with
the
help
of
the
gods
and
with
your
imperial
influence
i
hoped
to
return
in
triumph
with
my
weapons
wrapped
in
white
but
i
have
been
seized
with
a
mortal
disease
and
i
can
not
recover
i
am
lying
in
the
sweet
open
fields
i
do
not
care
for
my
life
i
only
regret
that
i
can
not
live
to
appear
before
thee
and
make
my
report
of
my
and
he
died
in
the
year
of
his
age
and
they
buried
him
there
and
built
a
mausoleum
over
his
remains
the
emperor
lamented
the
death
of
his
gallant
and
immortal
son
and
made
an
imperial
progress
into
the
regions
which
he
had
conquered
and
pacified
the
successor
to
the
emperor
keikō
was
known
by
the
canonical
name
of
seimu
he
was
the
thirteenth
emperor
and
was
the
grandson
of
his
predecessor
having
been
a
son
of
the
hero
who
was
the
crown
prince
until
his
death
the
emperor
seimu
reigned
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
eight
nothing
noteworthy
is
narrated
of
his
reign
his
successor
the
fourteenth
emperor
was
chūai
his
eldest
son
he
reigned
only
eight
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
it
is
remarkable
that
his
capital
was
in
the
island
of
kyūshū
and
not
in
the
main
island
like
his
predecessors
from
the
time
of
the
emperor
jimmu
this
removal
was
probably
due
to
the
preparations
which
had
already
begun
for
the
invasion
of
korea
the
island
of
kyūshū
is
most
favorably
situated
for
the
preparation
and
sailing
of
such
an
expedition
the
wife
of
this
emperor
was
who
was
a
much
more
forcible
and
energetic
character
than
her
husband
she
is
one
of
the
heroines
around
whom
much
tradition
has
gathered
and
her
successful
invasion
of
korea
is
an
event
which
the
japanese
writers
and
artists
are
never
tired
of
representing
the
undoubtedly
much
of
the
story
is
essentially
as
follows
the
emperor
was
busy
in
kyūshū
in
reducing
to
subjection
the
tribes
of
the
kumaso
who
inhabited
the
southern
portion
of
the
island
up
to
this
time
these
restless
tribes
had
given
much
trouble
to
the
empire
and
expeditions
were
constantly
needed
to
keep
them
in
order
they
were
unquestionably
of
a
kindred
race
with
the
japanese
who
accompanied
the
emperor
jimmu
into
the
main
island
the
empress
afterward
known
as
and
the
faithful
were
at
their
temporary
palace
at
kashihi
the
empress
in
an
interview
on
the
campaign
became
divinely
possessed
and
she
spoke
to
the
emperor
in
the
name
of
the
deity
that
possessed
her
saying
there
is
a
land
at
the
westward
and
in
that
land
there
is
abundance
of
various
treasures
dazzling
to
the
eye
from
gold
and
silver
downwards
i
will
now
bestow
this
land
upon
then
the
emperor
replied
if
you
ascend
to
a
high
place
and
look
westward
no
country
is
to
be
seen
there
is
only
the
great
and
he
pushed
away
the
lute
upon
which
he
was
playing
and
said
they
are
lying
deities
which
have
spoken
to
then
the
deity
was
very
angry
and
spoke
again
through
the
empress
this
empire
is
not
a
land
over
which
thou
art
fit
to
rule
go
thou
the
one
the
then
said
to
the
emperor
i
am
filled
with
awe
my
heavenly
sovereign
at
this
fearful
message
i
pray
thee
continue
playing
thy
august
then
he
played
softly
and
gradually
the
sound
died
away
and
all
was
still
and
they
took
a
light
and
looking
in
his
face
behold
he
was
dead
the
empress
and
the
concealed
for
the
time
the
death
of
the
emperor
and
she
herself
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
plan
for
the
invasion
of
korea
with
indefatigable
energy
she
gathered
her
forces
and
equipped
a
fleet
for
the
descent
upon
korea
she
set
out
from
wani
in
kyūshū
in
the
tenth
month
of
the
year
even
the
fish
of
the
sea
were
her
allies
for
with
one
accord
they
bore
the
ship
in
which
she
sailed
across
the
intervening
straits
on
their
backs
the
coming
of
the
japanese
was
a
complete
surprise
to
the
people
of
korea
at
this
time
the
peninsula
now
known
to
us
as
korea
and
to
the
japanese
as
chōsen
was
divided
into
three
kingdoms
kōrai
shiraki
and
kudara
the
fleet
of
landed
in
the
kingdom
of
shiraki
the
king
was
so
completely
unprepared
for
this
incursion
that
he
at
once
offered
his
subjection
and
proposed
to
become
a
tributary
kingdom
the
proposition
was
accepted
the
kings
of
kōrai
and
kudara
made
similar
proposals
which
also
were
accepted
each
was
to
make
an
immediate
contribution
to
the
empress
and
annually
thereafter
to
send
tribute
to
the
capital
of
japan
thus
they
became
the
three
tributary
countries
dependent
on
japan
although
this
invasion
of
a
foreign
country
without
cause
or
provocation
must
be
pronounced
indefensible
yet
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
subject
kingdoms
were
quite
as
safe
and
free
under
the
distant
and
little
intermeddlesome
dominion
of
the
japanese
empire
as
they
had
been
in
the
past
or
were
likely
to
be
in
the
future
from
their
troublesome
neighbors
china
and
the
restless
mongolian
tribes
to
japan
the
connection
with
the
continent
was
of
momentous
value
it
opened
up
a
natural
and
easy
way
for
the
influx
of
those
continental
influences
which
were
to
be
of
so
great
service
in
their
future
history
the
empress
having
within
three
years
completely
accomplished
the
object
of
her
expedition
returned
with
her
fleet
to
kyūshū
she
brought
back
with
her
hostages
from
the
conquered
kingdoms
to
ensure
their
fulfilment
of
the
promises
they
had
made
she
had
learned
many
lessons
of
government
which
she
was
not
slow
to
introduce
into
her
administration
at
home
soon
after
reaching
kyūshū
she
was
delivered
of
the
son
of
whom
she
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
emperor
and
who
afterwards
became
the
emperor
ōjin
the
object
which
she
and
her
faithful
had
in
concealing
the
death
of
the
emperor
was
accomplished
they
now
made
the
fact
public
and
proclaimed
her
own
son
as
her
successor
two
older
sons
of
chūai
by
another
empress
were
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
rule
of
a
younger
brother
but
the
empress
jingō
who
had
now
become
a
national
idol
by
her
korean
expedition
soon
put
down
the
conspiracy
of
these
princes
and
reigned
till
the
end
of
her
life
and
left
a
quiet
succession
to
her
son
she
is
said
to
have
reigned
as
years
and
to
have
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
her
son
became
the
fifteenth
emperor
and
is
known
by
the
canonical
name
of
ōjin
he
commenced
his
reign
in
the
year
and
reigned
forty
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
ten
but
the
beginning
of
his
reign
is
reckoned
in
the
government
list
from
the
death
of
his
father
the
emperor
ōjin
is
widely
worshipped
as
hachiman
the
god
of
war
although
he
is
by
no
means
noted
as
a
warrior
the
explanation
of
this
curious
circumstance
is
found
in
the
fact
that
his
mother
was
pregnant
with
him
during
her
famous
invasion
of
korea
and
her
heroism
and
success
are
attributed
to
the
martial
character
of
her
unborn
son
the
good
fruits
of
the
korean
conquest
particularly
showed
themselves
in
when
the
king
of
kudara
sent
his
usual
tribute
to
the
emperor
of
japan
the
ambassador
for
that
year
was
ajiki
a
learned
man
who
was
familiar
with
chinese
literature
at
the
request
of
the
emperor
he
gave
the
young
prince
who
afterwards
became
the
emperor
nintoku
lessons
in
the
chinese
language
and
literature
the
year
following
the
king
of
kudara
seeing
how
much
his
efforts
to
furnish
chinese
learning
were
appreciated
sent
an
eminent
chinese
scholar
wani
who
took
with
him
the
and
the
character
two
noted
chinese
classics
and
presented
them
to
the
emperor
the
prince
continued
his
studies
under
wani
and
became
a
very
learned
man
the
emperor
had
three
sons
between
whom
he
wished
to
divide
his
authority
wishing
however
to
establish
his
youngest
son
as
the
crown
prince
and
his
successor
he
summoned
them
before
him
and
put
this
question
to
the
elder
which
should
be
preferred
a
younger
son
or
an
older
then
the
elder
son
replied
that
he
thought
the
older
son
should
be
preferred
but
the
emperor
turned
to
the
second
son
and
asked
him
the
same
question
he
replied
that
as
the
older
son
was
more
grown
and
less
of
a
care
he
thought
the
younger
son
would
be
more
of
a
favorite
the
emperor
was
pleased
with
this
reply
because
it
coincided
with
his
own
sentiment
he
created
his
youngest
son
prince
the
crown
prince
and
ordered
his
second
son
prince
osasagi
to
assist
him
he
gave
the
charge
of
the
mountains
rivers
forests
fields
etc
to
his
eldest
son
so
when
the
emperor
ōjin
died
the
younger
son
urged
his
brother
to
accept
the
imperial
power
but
he
declined
saying
how
can
i
disobey
the
commands
of
my
father
the
oldest
of
the
three
brothers
learning
of
the
controversy
undertook
to
secure
the
authority
for
himself
by
a
plot
the
conspiracy
was
however
soon
put
down
and
the
elder
brother
slain
the
friendly
dispute
between
the
two
other
brothers
lasted
three
years
and
was
finally
ended
by
the
younger
committing
suicide
and
thus
devolving
the
imperial
office
on
his
remaining
brother
this
brother
was
the
noted
emperor
nintoku
he
began
his
reign
in
the
year
and
died
in
the
one
hundred
and
tenth
year
of
his
age
he
was
a
most
careful
and
considerate
ruler
by
observing
his
subjects
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
overburdened
and
impoverished
with
the
taxes
which
the
government
collected
from
them
so
he
announced
by
an
imperial
decree
that
for
three
years
all
taxes
should
be
remitted
even
the
sums
which
were
necessary
to
keep
the
palace
in
repair
and
to
provide
his
court
with
suitable
clothing
were
not
collected
and
the
palace
grew
shabby
and
its
roof
leaked
and
he
himself
went
about
in
coarse
and
cheap
garments
and
the
farmers
came
to
him
and
begged
that
they
might
contribute
to
his
wants
but
he
refused
and
suffered
three
years
to
pass
in
the
meantime
the
country
revived
and
the
farmers
being
relieved
from
the
burdens
which
they
had
so
long
borne
entered
on
a
long
period
of
encouraging
prosperity
he
surveyed
the
land
from
a
high
outlook
and
saw
the
curling
smoke
and
the
fertile
fields
and
rejoiced
then
he
gave
commands
and
the
taxes
were
renewed
and
the
people
paid
them
willingly
and
they
in
their
gratitude
called
nintoku
the
sage
emperor
it
was
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
nintoku
that
the
noted
prince
is
said
to
have
died
he
had
served
six
emperors
viz
keikō
seimu
chūai
ōjin
and
nintoku
his
age
is
given
variously
from
two
hundred
and
to
three
hundred
and
eighty
in
different
books
one
of
which
is
a
chinese
work
and
one
a
korean
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
was
the
chief
adviser
of
the
warlike
empress
jingō
in
her
invasion
of
korea
and
took
an
active
part
in
the
events
which
followed
that
expedition
that
there
was
such
a
figure
in
japanese
history
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
much
of
his
life
and
the
great
age
to
which
he
lived
are
like
many
of
the
stories
of
the
characters
in
the
midst
of
which
he
lived
legendary
and
mythical
no
one
can
question
it
was
in
this
reign
also
that
we
have
it
stated
that
historiographers
were
sent
out
to
the
provinces
and
directed
to
make
record
of
all
important
events
and
forward
them
to
the
court
we
have
now
reached
a
point
in
japanese
history
where
the
accounts
compiled
by
the
historians
of
the
times
have
written
records
on
which
to
rely
the
legendary
and
marvellous
stories
which
have
been
the
bulk
of
the
preceding
history
may
now
be
replaced
by
the
soberer
narrations
which
writing
has
preserved
for
us
it
will
be
seen
that
the
lives
of
the
emperors
now
drop
from
the
astonishing
age
which
in
previous
years
they
attained
to
a
very
moderate
and
reasonable
length
in
the
subsequent
chapters
will
be
found
the
sober
and
chastened
story
to
which
japanese
history
is
henceforth
reduced
chapter
native
culture
and
continental
influences
before
going
on
to
the
meagre
story
which
is
supplied
to
us
by
the
early
years
of
japanese
history
it
will
be
well
to
glean
from
the
myths
and
legends
which
tradition
has
preserved
the
lessons
which
they
contain
although
we
may
be
unable
to
concede
the
truth
of
these
traditions
in
their
entirety
and
believe
in
the
celestial
origin
of
the
race
and
the
wonders
of
the
divine
age
we
may
be
able
to
obtain
from
them
many
important
facts
regarding
the
habits
and
manner
of
life
of
the
early
japanese
we
have
often
referred
to
the
admirable
work
chamberlain
has
done
in
his
translation
of
the
and
in
the
scholarly
notes
he
has
added
but
in
our
present
enquiries
we
must
give
him
still
greater
credit
for
the
important
lessons
which
he
has
drawn
from
the
myths
and
legends
of
the
in
his
learned
introduction
no
writer
at
the
present
day
can
afford
to
dispense
with
the
deductions
which
he
has
been
able
to
draw
from
the
oldest
writings
of
the
japanese
and
from
the
traditions
of
an
older
date
which
these
writings
have
preserved
relying
therefore
chiefly
on
this
learned
introduction
we
propose
to
enumerate
in
a
summary
manner
the
particulars
concerning
the
early
japanese
life
in
the
first
place
the
government
of
the
early
japanese
was
of
the
tribal
order
the
emperor
was
the
chieftain
of
an
expedition
which
came
from
the
island
of
kyūshū
and
established
a
government
by
conquest
the
chiefs
of
the
various
localities
were
reduced
to
subjection
and
became
tributary
to
the
emperor
or
were
replaced
by
new
chiefs
appointed
by
the
emperor
the
government
was
therefore
essentially
feudal
in
its
characteristics
the
emperor
depended
for
the
consideration
of
his
plans
and
for
their
execution
upon
officers
who
were
attached
to
his
court
there
were
guilds
composed
of
those
who
manufactured
various
articles
or
who
were
employed
to
execute
special
plans
thus
we
have
guilds
of
clay
image
makers
guilds
of
ladies
attendant
on
the
emperor
guilds
of
butlers
guilds
of
cooks
guilds
of
guards
etc
to
each
of
these
there
was
a
captain
who
became
by
appointment
hereditary
chief
we
have
no
mention
of
money
for
the
payment
of
services
rendered
the
taxes
were
probably
paid
in
kind
and
all
transactions
as
far
as
they
are
mentioned
at
all
seem
to
have
been
of
the
nature
of
barter
the
religious
notions
of
the
prehistoric
japanese
were
founded
on
the
myths
relating
to
their
ancestor
notwithstanding
the
vast
number
of
deities
who
came
into
existence
according
to
tradition
most
of
them
vanish
as
soon
as
they
are
named
and
are
no
more
heard
of
even
deities
like
izanagi
and
izanami
who
are
represented
as
taking
so
important
a
part
in
events
are
not
perpetuated
as
objects
of
worship
in
japanese
history
and
have
no
temples
erected
to
their
memory
and
no
service
prescribed
or
maintained
in
their
honor
the
most
important
deity
in
the
pantheon
of
the
japanese
was
who
is
also
called
in
chinese
characters
tensho
daijin
or
the
sun
goddess
she
appears
not
only
in
the
myths
concerning
the
origin
of
the
japanese
race
but
as
the
grandmother
of
the
divine
prince
who
first
came
down
to
rule
the
japanese
empire
in
the
shintō
temples
at
isé
the
principal
deity
worshipped
at
gekū
is
and
the
secondary
deities
who
came
down
to
found
the
japanese
empire
and
was
the
grandmother
of
the
emperor
jimmu
and
two
others
at
the
naikū
the
principal
deity
is
from
heaven
shining
great
deity
also
called
the
sun
goddess
and
two
secondary
deities
the
temples
at
isé
especially
those
that
are
dedicated
to
the
sun
goddess
are
the
most
highly
regarded
of
any
in
japan
other
temples
of
considerable
popularity
are
situated
in
other
parts
of
the
empire
thus
there
are
shintō
temples
in
kyūshū
and
in
izumo
which
are
old
parts
of
japan
settled
long
before
buddhism
was
introduced
the
shintō
religion
must
be
regarded
as
the
primitive
religion
of
the
japanese
people
it
prevailed
among
them
long
before
buddhism
was
propagated
by
priests
from
korea
it
differs
from
all
known
systems
of
religion
in
having
no
body
of
dogma
by
which
its
adherents
are
held
together
the
greatest
advocate
of
shintoism
a
writer
of
the
century
admits
that
it
has
no
moral
code
he
asserts
that
morals
were
invented
by
the
chinese
because
they
were
an
immoral
people
but
in
japan
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
system
of
morals
as
every
japanese
acted
rightly
if
he
only
consulted
his
own
reference
is
frequently
made
in
the
early
stories
to
divination
or
the
process
of
obtaining
the
will
of
the
gods
by
indirection
the
oldest
method
of
divination
was
by
using
the
of
a
deer
it
was
scraped
entirely
free
from
flesh
and
then
placed
over
a
fire
made
from
cherry
wood
the
divine
will
was
determined
by
the
cracks
caused
by
the
fire
in
the
bone
a
later
method
of
divination
was
by
using
the
shell
of
a
tortoise
in
the
same
way
as
the
of
the
deer
was
used
they
had
superstitions
about
fighting
with
the
back
to
the
sun
about
using
only
one
light
in
the
house
at
once
about
breaking
off
the
teeth
of
a
comb
in
the
about
the
destination
of
the
first
arrow
shot
in
battle
etc
the
superstition
of
impurity
being
attached
to
the
mother
at
the
birth
of
a
child
and
to
the
house
and
those
associated
with
it
in
which
a
death
occurred
is
often
mentioned
a
mother
when
about
to
be
delivered
was
required
to
retire
alone
into
a
separate
dwelling
or
hut
without
windows
this
cruel
custom
has
prevailed
in
the
island
of
hachijō
down
almost
to
the
present
time
a
custom
prevailed
also
of
abandoning
the
dwelling
in
which
a
death
had
occurred
the
dead
body
was
removed
to
a
mourning
hut
where
amid
sobs
and
weeping
the
mourners
continued
to
hold
a
carousal
feasting
upon
the
food
provided
for
the
dead
this
abandonment
of
the
house
occupied
by
the
living
may
explain
the
custom
so
often
referred
to
of
each
new
emperor
occupying
a
different
palace
from
that
of
his
predecessor
we
have
already
referred
to
the
dreadful
custom
which
prevailed
until
the
reign
of
the
emperor
suinin
of
burying
living
retainers
around
the
sepulchre
of
their
dead
master
the
custom
was
replaced
by
burying
clay
images
of
servants
and
animals
around
the
tomb
and
this
continued
till
about
there
is
no
evidence
that
children
received
any
kind
of
education
other
than
a
training
in
the
use
of
arms
and
implements
the
art
of
writing
was
brought
over
from
korea
in
up
to
this
time
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
japanese
possessed
any
means
of
recording
the
events
which
occurred
no
books
existed
and
reading
and
writing
were
unknown
the
language
spoken
by
the
people
was
an
ancient
form
of
that
which
now
prevails
the
earliest
examples
of
this
language
are
found
in
the
songs
preserved
in
the
and
as
in
every
language
the
earliest
preserved
specimens
are
poetry
so
in
japanese
the
fragments
which
have
been
remembered
and
brought
down
to
us
are
scraps
of
songs
the
origin
of
this
language
is
like
the
origin
of
the
race
impossible
at
present
to
verify
it
seems
plain
that
the
race
came
from
the
continent
by
way
of
korea
if
this
is
to
be
taken
as
the
origin
of
the
race
then
the
language
which
developed
into
the
japanese
came
from
the
northern
tribes
of
china
and
of
siberia
there
is
no
indication
of
the
method
by
which
the
early
japanese
reckoned
time
the
sun
in
the
daytime
and
the
cocks
by
night
must
have
given
them
their
division
of
hours
the
year
made
itself
apparent
by
the
changes
of
temperature
it
was
not
however
till
the
introduction
of
calendars
from
china
that
anything
like
an
accurate
system
of
estimating
and
recording
time
was
introduced
the
food
of
the
primitive
japanese
was
much
more
largely
animal
than
it
became
in
later
times
to
the
early
japanese
there
was
no
restriction
in
the
use
of
animal
food
such
as
the
buddhists
introduced
fish
and
have
always
been
and
doubtless
from
the
first
were
principal
articles
of
food
the
five
grains
so
called
are
often
referred
to
and
are
specially
mentioned
in
the
shintō
rituals
whose
origin
goes
back
to
prehistoric
times
these
grains
are
rice
millet
barley
and
two
kinds
of
beans
silkworms
and
their
food
plant
the
mulberry
are
likewise
spoken
of
the
only
kind
of
drink
referred
to
is
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
the
myth
concerning
the
impetuous
male
deity
in
izumo
the
old
man
and
old
woman
were
directed
to
prepare
eight
tubs
of
by
drinking
which
the
serpent
was
intoxicated
in
the
traditional
history
of
the
emperors
they
are
represented
as
drinking
sometimes
even
to
intoxication
and
in
the
rituals
recited
when
offerings
are
made
to
their
deities
the
jars
of
are
enumerated
among
the
things
offered
the
japanese
writers
claim
that
was
a
native
discovery
but
there
is
a
well
supported
belief
that
in
very
early
times
they
borrowed
the
art
of
manufacturing
it
from
the
chinese
there
is
at
least
a
difficulty
in
believing
that
this
liquor
should
have
been
invented
independently
in
the
two
countries
chopsticks
are
mentioned
in
early
japanese
times
and
clay
vessels
for
food
and
cups
for
drinking
made
of
oak
leaves
on
the
whole
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
earliest
traditions
concerning
the
japanese
lead
us
to
regard
them
as
having
attained
a
material
degree
of
civilization
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
food
and
drink
yet
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
other
than
strange
that
milk
cheese
and
butter
are
nowhere
mentioned
and
had
never
been
used
in
the
matter
of
clothing
we
have
little
except
hints
to
guide
us
in
forming
inferences
the
rituals
enumerate
bright
cloth
soft
cloth
and
coarse
satow
remarks
on
this
enumeration
that
in
the
earliest
ages
the
materials
used
were
the
bark
of
the
wistaria
tendrils
and
hemp
but
when
the
silkworm
was
introduced
the
finer
fabric
naturally
took
the
place
of
the
humbler
in
the
offerings
to
the
the
which
is
now
used
for
making
paper
was
in
early
times
twisted
into
a
thread
and
woven
into
a
very
serviceable
cloth
cotton
which
now
furnishes
so
large
a
part
of
the
clothing
of
the
people
is
nowhere
mentioned
the
skins
of
animals
were
doubtless
used
as
clothing
before
the
introduction
of
buddhism
made
the
killing
of
animals
uncommon
in
the
legend
of
the
purification
of
izanagi
we
read
of
a
girdle
of
a
skirt
of
an
upper
garment
of
trousers
and
of
a
hat
what
the
shapes
of
these
garments
were
we
can
not
tell
but
the
number
of
different
garments
indicates
a
considerable
development
in
the
ideas
of
clothing
in
the
same
myth
and
in
many
other
places
mention
is
made
of
the
bracelets
which
izanagi
wore
on
the
left
and
right
arm
and
when
he
wished
to
show
his
pleasure
in
the
daughter
who
had
been
produced
in
washing
his
left
eye
he
invested
her
with
his
necklace
taken
from
his
own
neck
jewelry
seems
in
these
prehistoric
times
to
have
been
more
commonly
worn
than
in
modern
historical
times
the
jewels
used
were
the
and
which
have
been
found
in
the
ancient
burial
places
illustration
magatama
and
kudatama
rings
have
also
been
found
which
are
believed
to
date
back
to
prehistoric
times
from
the
clay
images
which
have
come
down
to
us
it
is
now
ascertained
that
the
rings
were
worn
as
ornaments
to
the
ears
and
never
as
rings
to
the
fingers
these
rings
are
of
copper
or
bronze
plated
with
gold
or
silver
combs
and
mirrors
are
spoken
of
but
how
the
metal
mirrors
are
made
we
do
not
know
the
only
indications
of
the
character
of
the
houses
used
by
the
early
japanese
are
found
in
the
traditions
respecting
the
primitive
shintō
temples
the
early
methods
of
building
were
perpetuated
in
these
temples
and
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
very
persistent
effort
was
made
for
the
revival
of
pure
shintō
under
the
influence
of
this
movement
the
temples
at
isé
and
elsewhere
were
purified
from
the
contaminations
which
had
been
introduced
by
buddhism
after
the
close
of
the
war
which
resulted
in
the
restoration
of
the
emperor
to
his
proper
authority
in
a
small
temple
in
the
most
severe
shintō
style
was
built
at
kudan
one
of
the
picturesque
heights
of
yedo
in
memory
of
the
soldiers
who
perished
in
the
conflict
from
a
careful
examination
of
all
that
can
illustrate
the
houses
of
the
early
japanese
we
infer
that
they
were
of
extreme
simplicity
stone
was
never
used
the
structures
were
entirely
of
wood
even
the
palaces
of
the
emperors
were
what
we
would
call
merely
huts
four
upright
posts
sunk
in
the
ground
formed
the
corners
at
the
intervals
between
these
posts
were
planted
four
other
posts
those
at
the
gable
ends
were
high
enough
to
sustain
the
ridge
pole
on
the
other
sides
on
the
top
of
the
posts
were
laid
two
plates
abutting
on
these
plates
and
crossing
each
other
at
the
ridge
pole
stood
the
rafters
which
sustained
the
thatched
roof
in
the
absence
of
nails
and
pins
the
timbers
were
fastened
together
by
the
tough
tendrils
of
climbing
plants
a
hole
in
the
gable
end
permitted
the
escape
of
the
smoke
from
the
fire
built
on
the
ground
floor
around
the
sides
of
the
interior
stood
a
raised
couch
on
which
the
occupants
sat
by
day
and
slept
at
night
the
other
parts
of
the
floor
were
uncovered
and
consisted
only
of
earth
they
used
mats
made
from
the
skins
of
animals
or
from
rushes
on
which
they
sat
and
slept
the
doors
of
their
dwellings
were
fastened
by
means
of
iron
hooks
and
swung
on
hinges
unlike
the
modern
japanese
door
which
always
is
made
to
slide
the
agricultural
plants
spoken
of
are
numerous
but
leave
unmentioned
many
of
the
plants
of
first
importance
tea
now
so
extensively
cultivated
is
nowhere
spoken
of
tobacco
was
a
late
importation
and
came
in
with
the
portuguese
in
the
sixteenth
century
cotton
was
not
introduced
as
we
have
already
said
until
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
potatoes
including
both
the
sweet
potato
and
the
white
potato
are
unmentioned
the
orange
came
to
japan
according
to
the
received
tradition
at
the
close
of
the
reign
of
the
emperor
suinin
very
little
is
said
of
the
implements
used
by
the
primitive
japanese
metal
of
any
kind
was
almost
unknown
we
read
of
swords
and
but
these
are
the
only
implements
referred
to
which
seem
to
have
been
made
of
metal
pots
and
cups
of
earthenware
were
used
the
axes
which
they
must
have
used
to
cut
down
the
trees
for
building
and
for
fuel
must
have
been
of
stone
or
sometimes
of
deer
s
horn
archæologists
both
native
and
foreign
have
brought
to
light
many
ancient
implements
of
the
stone
age
an
interesting
and
detailed
account
of
these
discoveries
will
be
found
in
the
work
on
by
henry
von
siebold
yokohoma
the
arms
used
by
the
warriors
were
spears
bows
and
arrows
and
swords
numerous
arrow
heads
have
been
found
which
bear
a
striking
likeness
to
those
found
in
europe
and
america
spear
heads
of
flint
have
also
been
found
that
the
people
were
emerging
from
the
stone
age
is
shown
by
the
swords
made
of
metal
which
they
are
represented
as
habitually
using
they
also
seem
to
have
had
a
small
sword
or
dagger
as
in
the
myth
of
the
traitorous
plot
entered
into
by
the
empress
and
her
brother
against
the
emperor
suinin
castles
in
the
modern
sense
are
not
referred
to
although
the
same
word
is
used
to
represent
the
stockades
with
which
they
protected
themselves
the
castles
of
modern
times
such
as
those
at
kumamoto
owari
and
yedo
are
without
doubt
the
outgrowth
of
the
primitive
stockade
and
the
same
name
has
continued
to
be
applied
in
all
the
successive
changes
few
domestic
animals
are
mentioned
the
horse
is
spoken
of
as
an
animal
for
riding
but
not
for
driving
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
the
use
of
horses
in
japan
even
until
modern
times
the
domestic
fowl
is
referred
to
in
the
myth
of
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
goddess
dogs
are
mentioned
in
the
later
parts
of
the
traditional
period
but
not
cats
the
cow
and
the
products
of
the
cow
are
not
referred
to
to
these
domestic
animals
may
be
added
the
cormorant
which
was
used
for
fishing
in
the
same
way
that
it
is
used
in
the
eastern
parts
of
china
and
to
a
small
extent
in
the
waters
of
owari
and
mino
at
the
present
time
the
wild
animals
of
that
day
were
the
deer
the
bear
the
boar
the
hare
etc
these
animals
were
hunted
for
their
flesh
and
for
their
skins
the
islands
of
japan
being
largely
interspersed
with
water
much
of
the
travel
even
from
the
earliest
time
was
performed
in
boats
the
expedition
of
jimmu
from
the
island
of
kyūshū
was
in
part
conducted
in
the
boats
which
the
colony
had
constructed
for
the
purpose
whether
these
boats
were
of
the
form
now
used
in
japan
it
is
impossible
to
determine
it
is
probable
however
that
the
present
form
of
boat
is
an
evolution
of
the
primitive
boat
which
was
used
by
the
prehistoric
japanese
and
which
was
a
part
of
the
equipment
with
which
their
ancestors
came
over
from
korea
to
the
islands
of
japan
travel
on
land
was
principally
on
foot
although
as
we
have
said
the
horse
was
used
at
this
early
day
for
riding
no
wheeled
vehicle
is
mentioned
the
bullock
cart
used
in
later
times
was
restricted
to
the
use
of
the
imperial
household
and
probably
was
introduced
by
the
buddhists
there
were
government
roads
constructed
from
the
home
provinces
in
different
directions
to
those
more
distant
it
is
said
that
this
scheme
was
more
fully
carried
out
after
the
return
of
the
empress
jingō
from
her
conquest
of
korea
let
us
now
turn
from
these
evidences
of
native
culture
to
the
events
of
japanese
history
which
have
to
do
with
the
introduction
of
the
civilization
from
the
continent
for
three
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
china
has
been
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
cultured
nations
of
the
earth
no
written
language
has
ever
been
or
is
now
understood
by
so
many
people
as
the
chinese
the
chinese
were
a
civilized
people
centuries
before
the
japanese
had
even
according
to
their
own
uncertain
legends
emerged
into
the
light
as
an
empire
if
we
accept
the
opinion
which
seems
most
reasonable
that
the
japanese
came
over
to
the
japanese
islands
from
the
continent
by
way
of
korea
and
belong
to
the
mongol
tribes
of
central
asia
then
we
must
assume
that
the
japanese
were
closely
related
to
a
large
section
of
the
chinese
they
have
been
from
the
beginning
of
their
history
a
receptive
people
they
have
stood
ready
to
welcome
the
good
things
which
were
offered
to
them
coming
from
whatever
direction
they
accepted
eagerly
the
chinese
written
language
and
the
philosophy
with
which
it
came
charged
they
accepted
buddhism
with
its
priesthood
and
dogma
and
ritual
and
permitted
it
to
crowd
their
native
religion
until
it
became
a
pitiful
minority
they
have
in
recent
times
accepted
with
a
hearty
impetuosity
the
civilization
of
western
nations
and
are
absorbing
it
as
rapidly
as
the
habits
and
thoughts
of
a
people
can
take
in
so
important
a
change
we
have
already
referred
to
the
first
introduction
of
chinese
literature
into
japan
it
took
place
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
ōjin
the
ambassador
who
brought
the
tribute
from
korea
that
year
was
ajiki
who
was
familiar
with
the
chinese
literature
he
gave
lessons
in
chinese
to
the
crown
prince
the
next
year
the
king
of
korea
sent
out
an
eminent
scholar
named
wani
who
continued
to
give
instruction
to
the
crown
prince
from
this
time
a
knowledge
of
chinese
gradually
spread
and
scholars
were
attached
to
the
government
to
make
a
written
record
of
the
events
which
took
place
historiographers
were
sent
out
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
hanzei
who
were
directed
to
make
a
record
of
all
important
events
and
forward
them
to
the
court
these
steps
soon
began
to
show
themselves
in
the
absence
of
the
wonderful
and
legendary
from
the
narrative
of
events
beginning
with
the
reign
of
the
emperor
richū
the
ages
of
the
emperors
which
before
his
time
had
been
of
such
a
marvellous
length
now
drop
to
a
reasonable
and
moderate
period
the
nineteenth
emperor
was
inkyō
the
fourth
son
of
the
emperor
nintoku
he
was
of
an
amiable
and
philanthropic
temperament
and
accepted
the
position
of
emperor
with
great
reluctance
his
health
was
delicate
and
he
feared
to
take
upon
himself
such
a
responsibility
in
the
meantime
there
was
an
interregnum
and
the
court
officials
were
anxious
to
have
him
enter
upon
the
duties
of
emperor
at
last
he
consented
and
became
emperor
it
was
during
his
reign
that
confusion
arose
concerning
the
family
names
or
rather
that
the
confusion
which
had
been
long
growing
now
had
its
settlement
family
names
had
been
a
matter
of
growth
and
many
persons
claimed
the
right
to
use
a
certain
name
who
were
in
no
wise
entitled
to
it
the
emperor
took
a
singular
and
effectual
method
to
settle
the
troublesome
and
personal
questions
that
arose
he
summoned
all
those
who
claimed
to
belong
to
any
family
whose
claim
was
disputed
to
appear
at
amakashi
and
show
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
names
they
claimed
he
placed
jars
of
boiling
water
and
required
each
one
to
plunge
his
hand
in
the
water
he
who
was
injured
by
the
hot
water
was
pronounced
a
deceiver
and
he
who
came
off
unhurt
was
pronounced
as
entitled
to
the
name
the
emperor
took
occasion
to
settle
the
questions
concerning
names
and
put
the
matter
on
a
more
stable
basis
and
as
the
art
of
writing
now
began
to
be
more
common
among
the
people
mistakes
in
regard
to
names
did
not
again
seriously
recur
the
emperor
s
was
the
occasion
for
the
introduction
of
another
of
the
civilizing
arts
of
the
continent
when
the
annual
tribute
from
korea
was
sent
it
so
chanced
that
the
ambassador
who
came
with
it
was
a
person
versed
in
the
medical
art
if
we
estimate
this
man
s
science
or
skill
by
that
of
the
chinese
practitioner
of
a
later
day
we
should
certainly
not
place
a
very
high
value
on
it
it
is
narrated
however
that
he
cured
the
imperial
invalid
and
by
this
means
gained
great
credit
for
his
profession
and
added
another
to
the
obligations
which
japan
owed
to
the
continent
after
the
death
of
the
emperor
inkyō
there
was
a
quarrel
about
the
succession
between
his
two
sons
prince
and
prince
the
courtiers
all
favored
the
latter
who
was
the
younger
brother
and
he
surrounded
his
elder
brother
in
the
house
of
seeing
no
way
of
escape
he
committed
suicide
the
younger
brother
then
became
the
twentieth
emperor
who
is
known
under
the
canonical
name
of
ankō
he
had
another
difficulty
growing
out
of
social
complications
he
wanted
to
make
the
younger
sister
of
who
was
the
brother
of
the
preceding
emperor
inkyō
the
wife
of
his
own
younger
brother
who
afterwards
became
the
emperor
yuriyaku
he
sent
as
a
messenger
the
court
official
to
ask
the
consent
of
her
elder
brother
who
gladly
gave
it
and
as
a
token
of
his
gratitude
for
this
high
honor
he
sent
a
rich
necklace
overcome
with
covetousness
kept
the
necklace
for
himself
and
reported
to
the
emperor
that
refused
his
consent
the
emperor
was
very
angry
and
sent
a
detachment
of
troops
against
the
supposed
offender
they
surrounded
the
house
and
put
him
to
death
his
chief
attendants
knowing
his
innocence
committed
suicide
by
the
side
of
their
dead
master
the
emperor
then
completed
his
design
of
taking
the
sister
of
as
the
wife
of
the
prince
and
he
also
took
his
widow
and
promoted
her
to
be
his
empress
out
of
these
circumstances
arose
serious
troubles
his
new
empress
had
a
young
son
by
her
first
husband
named
said
to
have
been
only
seven
years
old
with
his
mother
he
was
an
inmate
of
the
palace
and
was
probably
a
spoiled
and
wayward
boy
the
emperor
was
afraid
lest
this
boy
when
he
came
to
understand
who
had
been
the
cause
of
the
death
of
his
father
would
undertake
to
revenge
himself
he
talked
with
the
empress
about
his
fears
and
explained
his
apprehensions
the
boy
accidentally
heard
the
conversation
and
was
probably
stimulated
thereby
to
do
the
very
thing
which
the
emperor
feared
creeping
stealthily
into
the
room
where
the
emperor
lay
asleep
he
stabbed
him
and
then
fled
taking
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
grandee
tsubura
the
emperor
was
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
death
this
tragical
event
produced
a
great
excitement
the
younger
brother
of
the
emperor
ōhatsuse
amazed
and
angry
because
his
two
older
brothers
were
not
as
he
thought
sufficiently
enraged
by
the
murder
of
the
emperor
killed
them
both
then
he
attacked
the
grandee
tsubura
and
the
boy
mayuwa
in
their
refuge
seeing
no
way
of
escape
tsubura
at
the
request
of
the
boy
first
slew
him
and
then
killed
himself
subsequently
ōhatsuse
who
seemed
to
have
been
of
a
violent
disposition
murdered
son
of
the
seventeenth
emperor
richū
his
two
sons
then
merely
boys
ōke
and
woke
literally
big
basket
and
little

hearing
of
this
catastrophe
escaped
into
the
province
of
harima
where
they
worked
as
ōhatsuse
was
crowned
as
the
emperor
and
is
known
by
the
canonical
name
of
yūriyaku

in
the
year
an
ambassador
came
from
go
in
china
and
by
order
of
the
emperor
was
entertained
by
the
grandee
a
court
official
toneri
was
directed
to
see
that
this
duty
was
suitably
performed
now
it
will
be
remembered
was
the
grandee
who
on
a
former
occasion
was
sent
by
the
emperor
ankō
to
solicit
the
hand
of
the
princess
for
the
present
emperor
who
was
then
the
crown
prince
in
order
to
entertain
the
chinese
ambassador
with
becoming
magnificence
robed
himself
in
a
gorgeous
manner
and
among
other
things
put
on
the
rich
necklace
which
he
had
stolen
toneri
reported
to
the
emperor
the
superb
entertainment
which
had
accorded
to
the
chinese
ambassador
and
especially
the
necklace
which
he
wore
the
emperor
innocently
asked
that
should
appear
before
him
in
order
that
he
might
see
his
superb
dress
the
empress
who
was
with
her
husband
when
came
in
recognized
the
necklace
which
had
been
sent
by
her
brother
to
the
late
emperor
the
theft
was
charged
and
compelled
to
confess
the
emperor
proclaimed
the
innocence
of
and
his
great
regret
at
the
mistaken
punishments
there
are
many
traditions
current
in
japanese
early
history
concerning
this
emperor
in
one
he
is
represented
in
his
imperial
journeys
to
have
seen
a
house
belonging
to
lord
shiki
built
with
a
raised
roof
like
that
of
the
imperial
palace
he
was
greatly
enraged
that
any
subject
should
dare
to
take
such
a
liberty
and
sent
his
attendants
to
burn
the
house
down
the
poor
frightened
lord
hastened
to
the
emperor
and
humbly
apologized
for
his
stupidity
and
he
presented
to
the
emperor
in
token
of
his
humble
submission
a
white
dog
clothed
with
cloth
and
led
by
a
string
so
he
was
forgiven
and
his
house
was
spared
in
another
legend
he
is
said
to
have
come
upon
a
beautiful
girl
by
the
river
side
washing
clothes
he
stopped
and
conferred
with
her
and
said
to
her
do
not
thou
marry
a
husband
i
will
send
for
with
this
he
returned
to
the
palace
and
forgot
about
his
promise
but
the
poor
girl
did
not
forget
year
after
year
passed
till
at
last
after
eighty
years
of
waiting
she
was
a
very
old
woman
then
she
thought
my
face
and
form
are
lean
and
withered
there
is
no
longer
any
hope
nevertheless
if
i
do
not
show
the
heavenly
sovereign
how
truly
i
have
waited
my
disappointment
will
be
and
so
with
such
gifts
as
she
could
afford
she
presented
herself
before
the
emperor
he
wondering
at
her
and
her
gifts
asked
her
what
old
woman
art
thou
and
why
art
thou
come
hither
she
replied
having
in
such
and
such
a
month
and
such
and
such
a
year
received
the
heavenly
sovereign
s
commands
i
have
been
reverently
awaiting
the
great
command
until
this
day
and
eighty
years
have
passed
by
now
my
appearance
is
decrepit
and
there
is
no
longer
any
hope
nevertheless
i
have
come
forth
in
order
to
show
and
declare
my
thereupon
the
heavenly
sovereign
greatly
agitated
exclaimed
i
had
quite
forgotten
my
command
and
thou
meanwhile
ever
faithfully
awaiting
my
commands
hast
vainly
let
pass
by
the
years
of
thy
prime
it
is
too
he
sent
her
back
to
her
home
with
such
consolation
as
rich
gifts
could
impart
we
give
one
more
of
the
legends
which
cling
to
the
name
of
this
emperor
he
was
making
an
imperial
progress
to
the
moor
of
akizu
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
and
as
he
sat
down
to
rest
a
bit
his
august
arm
but
immediately
a
came
and
seized
the
and
flew
away
thereupon
he
composed
an
august
song
as
follows
who
is
it
tells
in
the
great
presence
that
game
is
lying
on
the
peak
of
womuro
at
our
great
lord
who
tranquilly
carries
on
the
government
being
seated
on
the
throne
to
await
the
game
a
alights
on
and
stings
the
fleshy
part
of
his
arm
fully
clad
in
a
sleeve
of
white
stuff
and
a
quickly
eats
up
the
that
it
might
properly
bear
its
name
the
land
of
yamato
was
called
the
island
of
the
after
a
long
reign
yūriyaku
is
said
in
to
have
died
at
the
age
of
one
hundred
and
the
son
of
the
emperor
yūriyaku
prince
shiraka
succeeded
him
he
is
known
in
history
as
the
emperor
seinei
he
lived
only
five
years
after
his
accession
and
left
no
descendant
to
fill
the
throne
search
was
accordingly
made
for
some
one
of
imperial
blood
who
might
become
emperor
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
emperor
yūriyaku
before
his
accession
had
murdered
prince
son
of
the
eighteenth
emperor
and
that
his
two
sons
then
young
boys
princes
ōke
and
woke
made
their
escape
into
the
province
of
harima
a
new
governor
of
this
province
had
just
arrived
and
was
in
attendance
at
the
festivities
in
honor
of
the
opening
of
a
new
cave
by
a
citizen
of
the
place
as
usual
there
was
feasting
and
drinking
and
dancing
the
two
young
men
ōke
and
woke
who
occupied
menial
positions
in
this
household
were
called
upon
to
dance
after
some
hesitation
they
each
in
succession
danced
and
sang
some
of
the
songs
which
they
had
learned
in
their
boyhood
the
new
governor
recognized
these
songs
to
be
such
as
were
taught
at
the
court
and
on
enquiring
found
the
young
men
to
be
grandsons
of
the
emperor
richū
he
brought
them
to
the
palace
and
presented
them
to
their
aunt
queen
after
a
friendly
contest
between
the
two
brothers
the
younger
one
prince
woke
became
the
emperor
under
the
canonical
name
of
kenzō
his
reign
was
a
very
short
one
only
eight
years
according
to
the
and
three
years
according
to
the
the
only
incident
of
consequence
recorded
of
him
is
that
he
sought
out
the
burial
place
of
his
father
who
had
been
murdered
by
the
emperor
yūriyaku
and
transferred
his
remains
to
a
fitting
mausoleum
he
also
contemplated
the
desecration
of
the
mausoleum
of
the
murderer
as
a
mark
of
his
vengeance
but
was
dissuaded
by
his
brother
from
the
undertaking
he
died
without
children
and
was
succeeded
by
his
elder
brother
prince
ōke
who
became
the
emperor
under
the
canonical
name
of
ninken
concerning
the
emperor
and
several
of
his
successors
there
is
little
of
interest
to
record
the
emperor
muretsu
who
was
a
son
of
the
emperor
ninken
was
chiefly
notable
for
his
cruelty
some
of
the
acts
recorded
of
him
can
only
be
equalled
by
those
of
the
degenerate
occupants
of
the
imperial
throne
of
rome
in
its
worst
days
he
reigned
eleven
years
and
died
without
children
the
emperor
was
keitai
tennō
who
was
the
fifth
descendant
from
ōjin
tennō
the
only
noticeable
events
in
his
reign
were
an
expedition
to
korea
to
settle
difficulties
which
had
then
intervened
and
an
expedition
to
chikushi
the
northern
part
of
kyūshū
to
repress
tumults
which
had
arisen
the
next
emperors
were
ankan
tennō
and
senkuwa
tennō
whose
reigns
were
uneventful
the
emperor
was
kimmei
tennō
who
was
the
son
of
keitai
tennō
he
reigned
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
it
was
during
his
reign
in
that
an
ambassador
from
kudara
one
of
the
three
provinces
of
korea
presented
to
the
emperor
an
image
of
shaka
and
also
buddhist
books
explaining
the
doctrine
he
commended
highly
the
new
religion
and
the
emperor
was
deeply
impressed
with
its
novelties
this
seems
the
more
probable
because
up
to
this
time
japan
looked
upon
china
and
korea
as
leaders
in
civilization
and
therefore
was
disposed
to
regard
what
had
obtained
a
footing
there
as
worthy
of
acceptance
the
favored
the
new
religion
and
urged
that
the
image
of
shaka
which
had
been
brought
over
should
be
duly
set
up
and
worshipped
but
the
ministers
and
kumako
opposed
the
proposition
saying
our
country
has
its
own
gods
and
they
perhaps
will
be
angry
with
us
if
we
pay
our
devotions
to
a
foreign
but
the
emperor
settled
the
matter
by
saying
let
iname
try
he
gave
the
idol
to
iname
with
the
directions
that
he
should
set
it
up
and
pray
to
it
accordingly
iname
took
the
image
of
shaka
and
established
it
in
a
house
of
his
own
which
he
created
a
temple
and
worshipped
it
but
shortly
after
this
an
epidemic
broke
out
in
the
country
and
okoshi
and
kumako
declared
that
it
was
due
to
the
strange
god
which
had
been
received
from
the
western
barbarians
and
besought
the
emperor
to
have
it
thrown
away
the
image
therefore
by
the
emperor
s
command
was
thrown
into
the
sea
near
naniwa
and
the
temple
in
which
it
had
been
erected
was
destroyed
this
was
the
first
movement
towards
the
introduction
of
buddhism
in
the
reign
of
the
thirtieth
emperor
bitatsu
tennō
who
was
the
son
of
kimmei
tennō
kudara
again
made
a
contribution
of
buddhist
emblems
viz
books
of
buddhist
doctrine
a
priest
of
ritsu
sect
a
priest
a
nun
a
diviner
an
image
maker
and
a
buddhist
temple
carpenter
these
were
all
housed
in
the
temple
of
at
naniwa
seven
years
after
this
two
japanese
ambassadors
who
had
been
sent
to
kudara
brought
back
with
them
several
buddhist
images
of
stone
which
the
daijin
umako
obtained
as
his
possession
he
built
several
buddhist
temples
in
which
he
placed
the
images
and
other
precious
relics
which
he
had
secured
he
also
built
a
pagoda
and
houses
in
which
the
priests
and
nuns
resided
when
umako
was
sick
he
asked
from
the
emperor
that
he
might
avail
himself
of
the
buddhist
ritual
the
emperor
gave
him
this
privilege
but
commanded
him
to
restrict
it
to
himself
the
emperor
bitatsu
died
at
the
age
of
his
successor
was
emperor
yōmei
the
in
order
from
the
emperor
jimmu
he
was
by
his
mother
a
descendant
of
the
soga
family
and
his
first
wife
was
also
a
daughter
of
the
the
noble
iname
who
was
also
of
the
soga
family
the
bitter
hostility
between
the
members
of
the
court
who
favored
buddhism
and
those
who
opposed
it
continued
the
leader
of
the
former
party
was
umako
now
the
while
the
opponents
of
buddhism
were
led
by
moriya
one
of
the
occasions
when
their
hostility
broke
out
was
when
the
emperor
was
taken
sick
and
he
wished
to
try
the
effect
of
the
buddhist
sampō
that
is
the
three
precious
elements
of
buddhism
buddha
the
rites
of
buddhism
and
the
buddhist
priests
moriya
and
his
party
advised
against
this
conformity
to
buddhism
but
umako
supported
him
in
his
wishes
and
introduced
a
buddhist
priest
into
the
palace
to
attend
upon
the
emperor
in
spite
of
all
this
effort
however
the
emperor
died
having
reigned
only
three
years
the
death
of
the
emperor
was
the
signal
for
the
breaking
out
of
serious
disturbances
moriya
the
champion
of
the
old
religion
was
killed
and
his
party
overpowered
from
this
time
buddhism
may
be
said
to
have
triumphed
in
japan
the
emperor
sujun
was
crowned
he
was
the
son
of
the
emperor
kimmei
and
at
the
time
of
his
accession
was
years
of
age
the
communication
with
korea
continued
and
more
and
more
of
the
buddhist
culture
was
introduced
umako
who
now
had
undisputed
sway
in
the
government
sent
out
to
korea
persons
to
study
the
buddhist
faith
and
consecrated
many
priests
and
nuns
and
erected
temples
for
the
new
worship
but
everything
did
not
move
smoothly
umako
with
all
his
zeal
and
enthusiasm
for
buddhism
was
suspected
of
personal
ambition
and
was
looked
upon
with
distrust
a
plot
to
assassinate
the
emperor
was
planned
by
umako
which
terminated
his
life
after
a
reign
of
only
four
years
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
sovereign
was
the
empress
suiko
who
was
the
sister
of
the
emperor
yōmei
her
coronation
took
place
her
reign
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
active
influence
of
who
was
the
second
son
of
the
emperor
yōmei
and
who
was
made
crown
prince
under
the
empress
and
aided
her
in
the
administration
of
the
political
affairs
of
the
government
this
prince
is
better
known
by
his
posthumous
title
of
shōtoku
taishi
great
teacher
of
the
divine
virtue
and
is
held
in
great
reverence
as
the
principal
founder
and
promoter
of
buddhism
in
japan
his
name
has
been
linked
with
many
legends
which
are
still
current
after
the
lapse
of
fourteen
hundred
years
it
is
said
that
as
soon
as
he
was
born
he
was
able
to
speak
and
was
in
all
respects
a
very
clever
boy
his
memory
was
wonderfully
acute
he
had
napoleon
the
great
s
talent
of
attending
to
several
things
at
the
same
time
he
could
hear
the
appeals
of
eight
persons
at
once
and
give
to
each
a
proper
answer
from
this
circumstance
he
sometimes
went
by
the
name
of
that
is
prince
of
eight
ears
the
prince
threw
the
whole
influence
of
the
government
in
favor
of
buddhism
many
temples
were
built
in
different
central
districts
for
the
convenience
of
the
new
religion
under
his
influence
the
officers
of
the
government
rivalled
each
other
in
founding
temples
and
maintaining
them
at
their
own
expense
he
took
as
his
teacher
a
priest
who
had
recently
come
from
korea
and
from
him
for
the
first
time
learned
the
five
buddhist
commandments
against
stealing
against
lying
against
intemperance
against
murder
against
adultery
he
gave
command
to
an
artificer
in
copper
to
make
large
images
of
buddha
for
each
of
the
officers
in
the
government
the
king
of
koma
in
korea
hearing
of
this
great
undertaking
sent
a
contribution
of
three
hundred
of
gold
the
images
were
finished
in
due
time
and
an
imposing
religious
ceremonial
was
held
in
honor
of
the
event
many
of
the
principal
temples
of
buddhism
in
different
parts
of
japan
take
their
origin
from
the
time
of
shōtoku
taishi
and
no
single
character
in
history
is
so
intimately
connected
with
the
development
of
buddhism
it
was
not
only
as
a
religious
reformer
however
that
he
deserves
to
be
remembered
he
was
a
a
most
painstaking
and
enlightened
ruler
he
studiously
gathered
from
the
chinese
the
elements
and
methods
of
government
and
adapted
them
to
his
own
country
from
his
time
the
study
of
chinese
literature
became
the
essential
culture
of
the
active
minds
of
japan
shōtoku
taishi
died
having
been
the
principal
officer
of
the
government
for
years
the
impulse
which
shōtoku
had
given
to
buddhism
did
not
subside
in
the
year
following
his
death
officers
were
appointed
to
govern
the
growing
religious
communities
called
sosho
and
sozu
which
in
dignity
and
power
corresponded
to
archbishops
and
bishops
in
christian
nomenclature
the
first
archbishop
was
kwankin
a
priest
from
kudara
and
the
first
bishop
was
tokuseki
of
kurabe
these
officials
examined
every
priest
and
nun
and
made
a
register
of
them
a
census
of
buddhism
is
also
given
which
belongs
to
this
same
period
according
to
this
there
were
buddhist
temples
and
priests
and
nuns
in
the
year
the
and
a
friend
and
promoter
of
buddhism
died
and
two
years
later
the
empress
suiko
died
so
nearly
all
the
prominent
participants
in
the
events
which
had
taken
place
since
the
first
entrance
of
buddhism
into
japan
had
disappeared
in
the
meantime
a
religion
had
taken
possession
of
a
field
in
which
it
was
destined
to
exert
a
wide
influence
and
undergo
a
national
development
along
with
this
religion
had
come
a
literature
and
a
culture
which
when
absorbed
into
the
life
of
this
people
gave
them
the
permanent
characteristics
which
we
now
recognize
as
the
japanese
civilization
the
freer
and
more
frequent
intercourse
with
china
and
korea
brought
with
it
not
only
a
knowledge
of
books
and
writing
but
many
improvements
in
arts
and
many
new
arts
and
agricultural
industries
when
the
forces
of
the
empress
jingō
returned
from
korea
they
brought
with
them
persons
skilled
in
many
industrial
occupations
it
is
a
tradition
that
a
descendant
of
the
kan
dynasty
in
china
had
fled
to
korea
on
the
fall
of
that
dynasty
and
in
the
twentieth
year
of
the
emperor
ōjin
had
migrated
to
japan
with
a
colony
who
were
familiar
with
weaving
and
sewing
in
the
year
of
the
same
emperor
an
officer
was
sent
to
china
to
obtain
more
weavers
and
sewers
the
cultivation
of
the
mulberry
tree
and
the
breeding
of
was
introduced
from
china
in
and
in
order
to
encourage
this
industry
the
empress
herself
engaged
in
it
at
this
early
period
this
important
industry
was
begun
or
at
least
received
an
impulse
which
has
been
continued
down
to
the
present
time
with
these
industrial
arts
came
in
rapid
succession
the
elements
of
a
higher
civilization
books
on
astronomy
geography
and
divination
were
brought
to
japan
from
korea
and
china
the
chinese
calendar
was
first
used
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
suiko
under
the
regency
of
shōtoku
taishi
this
almanac
was
based
on
the
lunar
periods
and
the
civil
year
began
with
the
new
moon
occurring
about
the
beginning
of
february
but
as
the
length
of
the
civil
year
is
not
an
exact
multiple
of
the
number
of
days
contained
in
a
lunation
the
twelve
lunar
months
used
by
the
chinese
and
japanese
will
be
about
eleven
days
shorter
than
the
solar
year
hence
to
prevent
the
discrepancy
from
increasing
and
throwing
the
seasons
entirely
out
of
their
place
in
the
calendar
an
intercalary
month
was
inserted
nearly
every
third
year
it
was
inserted
not
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
whenever
the
discrepancy
had
reached
the
number
of
days
in
a
lunation
the
month
thus
inserted
was
called
by
the
same
name
as
the
preceding
with
an
explanatory
prefix
from
this
period
therefore
the
dates
of
japanese
events
may
be
relied
upon
with
some
degree
of
certainty
for
events
occurring
before
this
period
a
knowledge
of
which
must
have
been
transmitted
by
oral
tradition
the
dates
assigned
to
them
in
the
must
have
been
computed
by
counting
back
to
the
supposed
time
according
to
the
calendar
in
use
at
the
time
of
the
writing
the
astronomy
and
geography
introduced
into
japan
along
with
in
the
fifth
century
were
without
question
very
primitive
sciences
at
this
time
even
in
europe
the
knowledge
of
these
sciences
was
not
advanced
beyond
the
imperfect
notions
of
the
greeks
it
was
not
until
the
sixteenth
century
when
the
discoveries
of
the
portuguese
and
the
spaniards
and
the
english
had
revealed
the
shape
and
the
divisions
of
the
earth
and
the
jesuits
had
carried
this
knowledge
to
china
and
japan
that
anything
like
a
correct
astronomy
or
geography
was
possible
by
divination
which
is
mentioned
as
one
of
the
sciences
brought
over
from
korea
was
meant
the
determination
of
future
events
or
of
lucky
or
unlucky
conditions
the
most
important
civilizing
force
introduced
from
china
at
this
period
was
the
formal
institutions
of
education
although
the
first
establishment
of
a
school
dates
from
the
reign
of
the
emperor
tenji
yet
it
was
not
till
the
reign
of
the
emperor
mommu
that
the
university
was
regularly
organized
branch
schools
were
also
established
in
the
several
provinces
in
the
university
there
were
departments
for
chinese
literature
for
medicine
for
astronomy
and
and
for
astrology
under
the
first
head
were
included
the
art
of
writing
the
chinese
characters
the
practice
of
composition
the
study
of
the
chinese
classics
and
the
reading
of
books
of
chinese
history
in
like
manner
the
training
of
the
students
in
medicine
chiefly
consisted
in
making
them
familiar
with
the
methods
which
prevailed
in
china
the
properties
of
medicinal
plants
the
variations
of
the
pulse
in
health
and
disease
and
in
the
changing
seasons
and
the
anatomy
of
the
human
body
were
the
chief
subjects
of
study
the
human
cadaver
was
never
dissected
but
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
was
obtained
from
diagrams
which
were
wholly
hypothetical
in
early
times
medical
officers
were
appointed
to
experiment
with
medicines
upon
monkeys
and
also
to
dissect
the
bodies
of
monkeys
from
these
dissections
as
well
as
from
the
printed
diagrams
of
chinese
books
the
imperfect
knowledge
which
they
had
reached
was
derived
it
was
not
till
that
sugita
genpaku
and
several
other
japanese
scholars
had
an
opportunity
to
dissect
the
body
of
a
criminal
and
by
personal
observation
found
the
utter
falsity
of
the
chinese
diagrams
on
which
they
had
hitherto
relied
and
the
correctness
of
the
dutch
books
which
they
had
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
country
learned
to
read
the
great
reverence
felt
for
chinese
culture
led
to
the
introduction
at
an
early
date
of
the
chinese
system
of
official
rank
the
system
remained
in
force
down
to
the
restoration
in
the
officers
were
minister
of
the
left
minister
of
the
right
together
with
eight
boards
charged
with
the
various
duties
of
administration
these
boards
were
divided
into
sections
and
the
various
departments
of
the
government
were
respectively
performed
by
them
in
this
way
the
administration
became
thoroughly
bureaucratic
in
imitation
of
the
chinese
empire
to
which
the
japanese
at
this
time
looked
up
with
the
most
complete
reverence
in
addition
to
these
official
boards
six
official
ranks
were
also
introduced
from
china
these
ranks
were
designated
first
virtue
second
humanity
third
propriety
fourth
truth
fifth
righteousness
and
sixth
wisdom
each
of
these
ranks
was
divided
into
two
orders
termed
respectively
the
greater
and
the
lesser
thus
there
were
twelve
distinctions
in
this
system
it
was
introduced
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
suiko
and
is
generally
attributed
to
the
regent
shōtoku
who
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
continental
civilization
it
existed
in
this
form
until
the
time
of
the
emperor
kōtoku
when
it
was
extended
to
nineteen
distinctions
these
were
not
given
to
the
individual
in
recognition
of
talent
but
to
families
to
be
by
them
transmitted
to
their
posterity
as
hereditary
rank
for
many
years
during
this
period
of
active
intercourse
with
china
and
korea
dazaifu
situated
on
the
west
coast
of
kyūshū
north
of
the
present
situation
of
nagasaki
was
the
recognized
port
where
strangers
were
received
this
city
was
the
seat
of
a
having
control
over
the
nine
provinces
of
kyūshū
the
office
of
was
considered
a
place
of
honorable
banishment
to
which
distinguished
men
who
were
distasteful
at
court
could
be
sent
these
continental
influences
continued
for
many
years
and
indeed
have
never
ceased
there
has
always
existed
a
class
of
scholars
who
looked
upon
chinese
learning
as
the
supreme
pinnacle
to
which
the
human
mind
could
attain
this
was
especially
true
of
the
admirers
of
confucius
and
confucianism
although
it
was
not
until
a
much
later
period
that
the
culture
of
a
chinese
philosophy
attained
its
highest
mark
yet
even
in
the
early
arrangement
of
the
studies
in
the
university
we
see
the
wide
influence
which
the
writings
of
the
chinese
classics
exerted
we
close
this
chapter
with
an
event
which
evinced
the
advance
which
japanese
civilization
had
made
and
aided
greatly
in
promoting
this
advance
in
the
subsequent
centuries
this
event
was
the
publication
of
the
record
of
ancient
things
and
the
chronicles
of
japan
a
book
still
older
than
these
is
said
to
have
been
composed
in
but
it
perished
in
a
fire
in
although
a
fragment
is
said
to
have
been
rescued
the
circumstances
attending
the
preparation
of
the
are
given
by
satow
in
his
paper
on
the
revival
of
pure
shintō
and
also
by
chamberlain
in
his
introduction
to
the
translation
the
emperor
temmu
had
resolved
to
take
measures
to
preserve
the
true
traditions
from
oblivion
he
had
the
records
carefully
examined
and
compiled
then
these
collated
traditions
were
one
by
one
committed
to
one
of
the
household
officers
who
had
a
marvellously
retentive
memory
before
the
work
of
compilation
was
finished
the
emperor
died
but
the
empress
gemmyō
who
after
an
interval
succeeded
him
carried
it
on
to
its
completion
in
by
her
direction
the
traditions
were
taken
down
from
are
s
dictation
in
the
form
in
which
we
now
have
them
it
is
by
no
means
a
pleasing
or
attractive
work
even
in
the
opinion
of
the
japanese
it
is
bald
and
archaic
in
its
form
and
composition
it
is
however
notable
as
being
freer
from
the
admixture
of
chinese
learning
and
therefore
a
better
index
of
the
native
culture
of
the
race
than
the
works
which
followed
it
much
of
it
consists
of
mere
genealogies
of
the
emperors
and
naked
statements
of
leading
events
but
there
are
besides
this
many
legends
and
poems
which
bear
evidence
of
having
been
handed
down
in
essentially
their
present
form
as
an
authority
for
the
chronology
of
the
early
events
it
is
of
course
of
small
value
it
is
evident
that
where
a
narrative
of
events
has
been
carried
through
many
centuries
by
tradition
alone
without
written
records
to
check
or
assist
it
no
dependence
can
be
placed
on
the
chronology
of
the
events
further
than
perhaps
on
the
order
of
sequence
only
eight
years
after
the
publication
of
the
a
second
work
termed
or
chronicles
of
japan
was
issued
it
was
prepared
by
imperial
command
and
appeared
in
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
genshō
it
differs
from
the
older
book
in
being
composed
in
the
chinese
idiom
and
in
being
much
more
tinctured
with
the
ideas
of
chinese
philosophy
these
two
works
so
nearly
contemporaneous
both
of
them
composed
in
so
great
a
degree
of
the
legendary
elements
of
japanese
history
must
be
looked
upon
as
marking
a
distinct
epoch
in
the
story
of
japan
chapter
vi
the
middle
ages
of
japan
the
theory
of
the
japanese
government
during
the
greater
part
of
its
long
career
has
been
that
of
an
absolute
monarchy
the
emperor
was
supposed
to
hold
in
his
hands
the
supreme
authority
and
to
dispose
as
he
saw
fit
of
honors
and
emoluments
offices
and
administrative
duties
there
was
no
fundamental
law
of
succession
by
which
the
order
of
accession
to
the
throne
was
regulated
the
reigning
emperor
usually
selected
during
his
lifetime
some
one
of
his
sons
or
if
he
had
no
sons
some
other
prince
of
the
imperial
family
who
became
the
crown
prince
during
the
life
of
the
emperor
and
on
his
death
succeeded
to
the
throne
the
selection
was
usually
made
with
the
concurrence
of
the
officers
of
the
court
and
very
often
must
be
credited
entirely
to
the
preference
of
these
officers
sometimes
the
emperor
died
before
the
appointment
of
a
crown
prince
had
taken
place
in
this
case
the
selection
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
court
officers
and
many
cases
are
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
empire
where
serious
disturbances
arose
between
the
partisans
of
different
aspirants
to
the
throne
these
disturbances
usually
account
for
the
which
are
so
often
found
between
the
reigns
of
successive
sovereigns
to
the
freedom
which
has
prevailed
not
only
in
the
imperial
house
but
also
in
all
the
families
of
the
empire
in
regard
to
the
rights
of
succession
must
be
attributed
the
long
and
unbroken
line
which
the
imperial
house
of
japan
is
able
to
show
that
a
line
of
sovereigns
should
continue
from
the
time
of
jimmu
down
to
the
present
without
break
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
children
is
of
course
impossible
but
the
difficulty
disappears
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
case
of
the
failure
of
a
son
to
succeed
the
father
provided
for
the
want
by
adopting
as
his
son
some
prince
of
the
imperial
family
and
appointing
him
as
his
heir
with
this
principle
of
adoption
must
be
mentioned
the
practice
of
abdication
which
produced
a
marked
and
constantly
recurring
influence
in
the
history
of
japan
especially
was
this
the
case
in
the
middle
ages
of
japanese
history
the
practice
spread
from
the
imperial
house
downwards
into
all
departments
of
japanese
life
although
the
principle
of
abdication
and
adoption
was
probably
brought
from
china
and
was
adopted
by
the
japanese
as
a
mark
of
superior
culture
yet
these
practices
were
carried
to
a
much
greater
extent
in
japan
than
was
ever
thought
of
in
their
original
home
we
shall
see
in
the
story
of
japanese
times
the
amazing
and
ludicrous
extent
to
which
the
abdication
of
reigning
sovereigns
was
carried
we
shall
witness
even
the
great
and
sagacious
ieyasu
himself
after
holding
the
office
of
shōgun
for
only
two
years
retiring
in
favor
of
his
son
hidetada
and
yet
from
his
retirement
practically
exercising
the
authority
of
the
office
for
many
years
in
the
emperor
tenji
began
a
brief
reign
of
three
years
as
he
had
been
regent
during
the
two
preceding
reigns
and
chiefly
managed
the
administration
very
little
change
occurred
after
his
accession
to
power
his
reign
is
mainly
remarkable
for
the
first
appearance
in
a
prominent
position
of
the
fujiwara
family
the
emperor
appointed
his
counsellor
as
private
minister
an
office
next
in
rank
after
and
which
was
created
at
this
time
nakatomi
was
authorized
to
assume
the
family
name
of
fujiwara
meaning
the
ancestor
of
this
family
was
fabled
to
have
come
down
from
the
celestial
plains
to
the
island
of
kyūshū
the
family
therefore
ranks
with
that
of
the
emperor
as
the
oldest
and
most
honored
in
the
empire
from
the
time
of
its
establishment
down
to
the
present
it
has
enjoyed
many
honors
and
privileges
and
has
played
a
very
distinguished
part
in
the
history
of
the
country
this
family
first
became
prominent
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
kōtoku
the
soga
family
from
the
times
of
the
first
introduction
of
buddhism
had
grown
to
be
the
most
powerful
and
influential
in
the
empire
umako
had
held
the
position
of
and
his
son
yemishi
became
after
his
father
s
death
yemishi
presumed
upon
his
promotion
to
this
high
office
and
put
on
the
airs
of
hereditary
rank
he
built
castles
for
himself
and
son
and
organized
guards
for
their
defence
his
son
iruka
became
after
his
father
s
death
and
conducted
himself
with
even
greater
arrogance
at
last
his
conduct
became
intolerable
and
he
was
assassinated
the
chief
actor
in
this
plot
was
who
was
at
this
time
on
intimate
terms
with
the
prince
who
afterwards
became
the
emperor
tenji
further
experiences
this
time
disastrous
with
korea
were
encountered
during
this
reign
a
japanese
garrison
had
been
maintained
in
kudara
the
western
division
of
korea
but
at
this
time
the
people
of
shiraki
with
help
from
china
attacked
this
garrison
and
compelled
it
to
retreat
to
japan
along
with
the
japanese
came
many
of
the
koreans
who
had
been
friendly
with
them
and
who
carried
with
them
like
the
huguenots
when
driven
from
france
a
knowledge
of
many
arts
and
a
culture
which
were
eagerly
welcomed
by
the
rising
japanese
empire
they
were
colonized
in
convenient
quarters
in
different
provinces
and
as
an
encouragement
freed
from
taxation
for
a
time
their
influence
upon
the
opening
civilization
of
japan
can
not
be
overlooked
or
neglected
in
our
estimate
of
the
forces
which
conspired
to
produce
the
final
result
in
the
book
of
japanese
annals
called
there
is
a
statement
that
in
the
fifth
month
of
the
second
year
of
koreans
were
collected
together
in
the
province
of
musashi
and
formed
the
district
of
or
korean
district
again
in
the
third
year
of
forty
inhabitants
of
shinra
a
kingdom
of
korea
and
priests
and
priestesses
came
to
japan
and
founded
the
or
korean
district
these
events
occurred
not
long
after
the
time
we
are
now
considering
and
show
that
the
korean
colonization
still
continued
and
that
the
influence
of
the
arts
and
culture
which
the
colonists
introduced
was
marked
and
important
few
events
are
noted
during
the
reigns
which
succeeded
the
following
are
the
most
worthy
of
mention
the
emperor
temmu
added
several
new
degrees
of
rank
to
those
already
established
he
also
favored
the
buddhist
religion
by
making
its
services
obligatory
and
by
forbidding
the
eating
of
flesh
silver
was
first
discovered
in
tsushima
which
was
followed
twenty
years
later
by
the
manufacture
of
the
first
silver
money
copper
was
discovered
in
musashi
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
gemmyō
and
the
making
of
copper
money
came
into
vogue
before
that
time
the
copper
money
in
use
was
obtained
from
korea
and
china
gold
coin
is
said
to
have
been
first
issued
under
the
emperor
junnin
an
observatory
was
established
for
the
inspection
of
the
stars
in
connection
with
the
new
department
of
astrology
the
cultivation
of
the
lacquer
tree
and
the
mulberry
and
the
raising
of
were
still
further
encouraged
and
extended
cremation
was
first
practised
about
in
the
case
of
a
buddhist
priest
who
left
directions
that
his
body
should
be
burned
since
that
time
cremation
has
been
employed
for
the
disposal
of
the
dead
by
the
shin
or
monto
sect
and
is
now
authorized
but
not
made
obligatory
by
the
government
the
progress
made
by
buddhism
is
shown
by
the
census
of
temples
which
was
made
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
jito
and
which
gave
the
number
as
the
publication
of
the
in
and
of
the
eight
years
later
has
already
been
referred
to
at
the
close
of
the
preceding
chapter
these
works
are
still
looked
upon
as
the
foundations
of
japanese
literature
and
the
highest
authorities
of
japanese
history
in
the
reign
of
the
empress
gemmyō
the
imperial
residence
was
fixed
at
nara
up
to
this
time
the
custom
derived
from
antiquity
had
prevailed
of
changing
the
residence
on
the
accession
of
each
new
emperor
but
the
court
continued
at
nara
for
a
period
of
years
running
through
seven
reigns
and
in
consequence
nara
has
always
been
looked
upon
with
peculiar
reverence
and
is
the
seat
of
several
of
the
most
notable
buddhist
and
shintō
temples
and
structures
it
is
here
that
was
founded
in
and
dedicated
to
the
honor
of
the
ancestor
of
the
fujiwara
family
here
also
is
a
buddhist
temple
famed
for
containing
the
bronze
statue
of
great
buddha
this
colossal
idol
was
constructed
in
under
the
emperor
shōmu
during
the
time
that
the
imperial
court
resided
at
nara
the
height
of
the
image
is
feet
being
seven
feet
higher
than
the
daibutsu
at
kamakura
the
temple
was
built
over
the
image
and
in
was
destroyed
by
a
fire
which
melted
the
head
of
the
image
this
was
replaced
the
temple
was
burned
again
from
which
time
the
image
has
remained
as
the
japanese
say
a
wet
in
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
kwammu
the
capital
was
removed
to
kyōto
on
the
banks
of
the
kamogawa
the
situation
and
the
environs
are
lovely
and
justify
the
affectionate
reverence
with
which
it
has
ever
been
regarded
here
were
built
the
palaces
and
offices
for
the
emperor
and
his
court
it
was
officially
called
miyako
that
is
residence
of
the
sovereign
it
continued
to
be
occupied
as
the
capital
until
when
the
court
was
moved
to
tōkyō
at
this
time
the
name
of
the
city
was
changed
to
saikyō
which
means
western
capital
in
distinction
from
tōkyō
which
means
eastern
capital
the
emishi
in
the
northern
part
of
the
main
island
continued
to
give
much
trouble
to
the
government
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
shōmu
was
sent
against
these
restless
neighbors
and
succeeded
in
reducing
them
to
subjection
which
lasted
longer
than
usual
a
fort
was
built
to
keep
them
in
subjection
called
the
castle
of
taga
there
is
still
standing
a
stone
monument
at
taga
between
sendai
and
matsushima
on
which
is
an
inscription
which
has
been
translated
by
aston
of
the
british
legation
the
inscription
gives
the
date
of
its
first
construction
which
corresponds
to
and
of
its
restoration
aston
points
out
that
the
here
mentioned
is
not
the
present
japanese
equivalent
to
miles
but
the
ancient
which
is
somewhat
less
than
half
a
mile
this
makes
it
evident
that
the
part
of
the
main
island
north
of
a
point
near
sendai
was
at
this
time
denominated
yezo
and
was
occupied
by
the
barbarous
tribes
who
then
as
now
called
themselves
yezo
the
employment
of
a
fujiwara
in
this
expedition
was
probably
purely
perfunctory
so
far
as
we
know
this
family
which
had
by
this
time
risen
to
a
position
of
great
influence
was
in
no
respect
military
and
the
appointment
of
umakai
as
chief
of
the
forces
sent
against
the
ainos
was
due
to
the
political
prominence
of
his
family
for
many
centuries
the
relations
of
the
fujiwara
family
to
the
imperial
house
was
most
intimate
indeed
the
late
viscount
mori
in
his
introduction
to
in
speaks
of
this
relation
as
a
the
throne
for
a
time
became
virtually
the
property
of
one
family
who
exclusively
controlled
this
family
was
that
of
fujiwara
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
the
founder
of
this
house
kamatari
was
a
man
of
great
talent
and
administrative
ability
and
his
immediate
successors
were
worthy
of
their
ancestor
s
fame
and
in
succession
filled
the
office
of
in
this
way
the
office
came
to
be
regarded
as
hereditary
in
the
fujiwara
family
the
office
of
also
from
about
became
hereditary
in
the
fujiwara
house
owing
to
the
great
age
and
prominence
of
the
family
it
became
customary
to
marry
the
emperors
and
princes
of
the
imperial
house
to
ladies
taken
from
it
so
that
after
a
time
the
mothers
and
wives
of
the
princes
of
the
imperial
house
were
without
exception
descendants
of
the
fujiwara
and
the
offices
of
the
court
were
in
the
hands
of
this
family
in
this
condition
of
things
the
abdication
of
emperors
before
they
had
reigned
long
enough
to
learn
the
duties
of
their
position
became
the
common
practice
this
vicious
custom
was
encouraged
by
the
fujiwara
because
it
placed
greater
authority
in
their
hands
and
left
them
to
conduct
the
administration
without
troublesome
interference
the
emperor
seiwa
commenced
to
reign
when
he
was
nine
years
of
age
and
abdicated
when
he
was
shujaku
became
emperor
when
he
was
eight
years
of
age
and
abdicated
at
the
age
of
toba
became
emperor
at
five
years
of
age
and
resigned
at
the
age
of
twenty
rokujō
was
made
emperor
at
the
age
of
two
and
resigned
at
the
age
of
four
takakura
who
succeeded
rokujō
was
eight
years
of
age
and
abdicated
at
the
age
of
nineteen
it
often
happened
that
there
were
living
at
the
same
time
several
retired
emperors
besides
the
actual
emperor
thus
in
the
period
when
ichijō
began
his
reign
at
the
age
of
seven
there
were
three
retired
emperors
still
living
viz
reizei
who
began
to
reign
at
eighteen
and
retired
at
twenty
enyū
who
began
to
reign
at
eleven
and
retired
at
kwazan
who
began
to
reign
at
seventeen
and
retired
at
nineteen
at
a
period
somewhat
later
than
the
one
now
under
consideration
during
the
reign
of
who
had
just
been
made
emperor
at
seventeen
and
who
retired
at
nineteen
there
were
four
retired
emperors
living
when
the
emperors
retired
they
often
went
into
a
buddhist
monastery
taking
the
title
of
or
from
this
sacred
seclusion
they
continued
many
times
to
wield
the
powers
of
government
the
object
of
this
abdication
was
twofold
the
sovereigns
themselves
often
became
restless
and
dissatisfied
in
the
constrained
attitude
which
they
were
compelled
to
maintain
if
they
were
in
the
least
ambitious
to
meet
the
requirements
of
their
elevated
position
and
realized
in
any
degree
the
legitimate
claims
which
their
country
had
upon
them
their
natural
efforts
to
take
part
in
the
administration
were
promptly
checked
and
they
were
reminded
that
it
was
unbecoming
and
unfitting
for
the
descendants
of
the
gods
to
mingle
in
ordinary
earthly
affairs
in
this
way
it
often
fell
out
that
the
ablest
of
the
emperors
retired
from
the
actual
position
of
reigning
emperor
in
order
to
free
themselves
from
the
restraints
of
etiquette
and
from
the
burden
of
which
held
them
captive
they
assumed
the
dignity
of
retired
emperors
and
often
from
their
retirement
wielded
a
greater
influence
and
exerted
a
far
more
active
part
in
the
administration
of
affairs
than
they
ever
had
been
able
to
do
when
upon
the
imperial
throne
besides
this
motive
which
affected
the
occupants
of
the
throne
there
was
a
corresponding
one
which
led
the
officers
of
the
court
to
encourage
and
perhaps
sometimes
to
compel
the
emperors
to
abdicate
these
administrative
officers
into
whose
hands
the
management
of
the
government
had
fallen
were
desirous
to
retain
their
authority
and
therefore
whenever
an
emperor
exhibited
signs
of
independence
or
any
disposition
to
think
or
act
for
himself
they
contrived
means
to
have
him
retire
and
leave
in
his
place
some
inexperienced
boy
who
could
be
more
easily
controlled
in
this
kind
of
supervising
statesmanship
the
fujiwara
family
became
and
for
centuries
remained
supreme
experts
for
a
period
of
four
hundred
years
from
to
they
monopolized
nearly
all
the
important
offices
in
the
government
the
wives
and
concubines
of
the
feeble
emperors
were
all
taken
from
its
inexhaustible
the
men
of
the
family
among
whom
were
always
some
of
administrative
ability
found
it
a
task
of
no
great
difficulty
to
rule
the
emperor
who
was
supposed
to
be
divinely
inspired
to
rule
the
empire
especially
when
he
was
usually
a
boy
whose
mother
wife
and
court
favorites
were
all
supplied
from
the
fujiwara
family
this
kind
of
life
and
environment
could
not
fail
to
produce
on
the
successive
emperors
a
sadly
demoralizing
effect
they
were
brought
up
in
an
enervating
atmosphere
and
their
whole
life
was
spent
in
arts
and
employments
which
instead
of
developing
in
them
a
spirit
of
independence
and
a
high
ambition
and
ability
to
govern
well
the
empire
committed
to
them
led
them
to
devote
themselves
to
pleasures
and
to
leave
to
others
less
fortunate
the
duty
of
administering
the
affairs
of
government
the
same
circumstances
which
demoralized
the
occupants
of
the
imperial
throne
served
in
a
certain
though
less
degree
to
enervate
and
enfeeble
the
fujiwara
family
although
they
sometimes
appointed
one
of
their
number
the
commander
of
an
expedition
against
the
emishi
or
to
put
down
fresh
revolts
in
the
island
of
kyūshū
yet
his
duties
were
purely
honorary
he
usually
remained
at
home
and
sent
one
or
more
of
the
active
military
chieftains
to
lead
the
forces
against
the
enemy
in
the
field
if
the
expedition
was
successful
however
the
honorary
commander
did
not
forget
to
have
himself
duly
promoted
and
rewarded
with
additional
lands
and
income
other
families
besides
the
fujiwara
rose
in
these
long
and
weary
centuries
to
prominence
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
disputing
the
security
of
their
position
thus
the
tachibana
in
the
eighth
century
attained
high
honors
and
distinction
it
was
an
old
family
and
even
as
far
back
as
the
legend
of
we
find
that
a
princess
of
the
tachibana
family
was
his
wife
who
sacrificed
herself
in
the
bay
of
yedo
to
appease
the
turbulent
waters
it
was
maroyé
a
member
of
the
tachibana
family
and
a
favorite
of
the
emperor
shōmu
who
compiled
the
collection
of
ancient
japanese
poetry
called
or
collection
of
myriad
leaves
another
family
which
attained
prominence
was
the
sugawara
it
originated
in
the
province
of
kawachi
the
most
noted
representative
of
this
family
was
sugawara
michizané
who
was
first
conspicuous
as
the
teacher
of
the
young
prince
who
afterward
became
the
emperor
uda
he
was
a
brilliant
scholar
in
chinese
which
was
then
the
learned
language
of
the
east
even
down
to
modern
times
his
family
has
been
devoted
to
learning
the
sugawara
and
ōye
families
both
had
adopted
literature
as
their
hereditary
profession
and
the
government
made
them
an
allowance
for
the
expenses
of
those
who
might
be
pursuing
their
studies
in
the
national
university
the
influence
of
michizané
over
the
emperor
was
marked
and
salutary
under
his
wise
tutelage
uda
showed
so
much
independence
that
the
fujiwara
found
means
to
lead
him
to
abdicate
in
favor
of
his
son
who
became
the
sixtieth
emperor
and
is
known
under
the
historic
name
of
daigo
michizané
became
the
counsellor
and
was
created
under
the
new
emperor
who
at
the
time
of
his
accession
was
only
fourteen
years
old
but
the
tokihira
determined
to
free
himself
from
the
adverse
influence
of
this
wise
and
honest
counsellor
so
he
had
him
sent
in
a
kind
of
honorable
banishment
to
dazaifu
the
seat
of
the
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
it
is
said
that
he
died
here
in
there
was
a
great
in
regard
to
him
after
his
death
and
he
was
canonized
under
the
name
of
tenjin
heavenly
god
and
is
held
sacred
as
the
patron
saint
of
men
of
letters
and
of
students
the
day
of
each
month
is
kept
as
a
holiday
in
schools
sacred
to
and
the
of
june
as
an
annual
illustration
michizane
but
the
families
which
finally
displaced
the
fujiwara
from
their
position
of
supremacy
were
what
were
technically
called
the
military
families
the
separation
of
officers
into
civil
and
military
was
made
under
the
reforms
introduced
from
china
the
fujiwara
in
the
main
restricted
themselves
to
civil
duties
wherever
it
was
necessary
to
send
military
expeditions
against
the
barbarians
of
the
north
or
rebels
in
kyūshū
or
into
the
disaffected
districts
of
korea
commanders
were
selected
from
families
devoted
to
military
service
the
taira
family
was
of
this
class
hei
is
the
chinese
equivalent
of
the
japanese
name
taira
and
is
more
often
used
in
the
literature
of
the
times
the
taira
family
sprang
from
the
emperor
kwammu
through
one
of
his
concubines
the
of
kwammu
takamochi
received
permission
to
adopt
the
name
of
taira
and
thus
became
the
founder
of
the
family
they
were
the
military
vassals
of
the
crown
for
many
generations
a
little
later
than
the
taira
arose
another
family
the
minamoto
whose
equivalent
chinese
name
was
gen
it
sprang
from
the
emperor
seiwa
his
son
tadazumi
became
minister
of
war
tadazumi
had
two
sons
who
were
granted
the
family
name
of
minamoto
the
descendants
of
one
of
them
tsunemoto
being
created
military
vassals
the
almost
constant
wars
in
which
the
empire
was
engaged
led
to
the
extension
of
the
military
class
from
the
time
now
under
discussion
the
military
class
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
distinct
and
separate
part
of
the
population
it
was
composed
of
those
who
in
the
time
of
war
showed
an
aptitude
for
arms
and
who
were
most
serviceable
in
the
campaigns
which
they
undertook
gradually
they
became
distinct
from
the
agricultural
peasantry
and
by
education
and
training
came
to
look
upon
arms
as
their
legitimate
profession
they
naturally
attached
themselves
to
the
military
commanders
who
led
them
in
their
various
expeditions
and
thus
were
in
time
regarded
as
the
standing
troops
of
the
empire
this
growth
of
a
military
class
whose
commanders
were
restless
and
ambitious
gradually
undermined
the
authority
which
the
fujiwara
up
to
the
tenth
century
had
almost
unrestrictedly
exercised
the
employment
of
commanders
from
the
military
families
raised
in
them
an
ambition
to
share
in
the
powers
of
government
the
struggles
which
ensued
first
between
the
fujiwara
and
taira
and
then
between
the
taira
and
minamoto
continued
to
keep
the
country
embroiled
for
more
than
a
century
the
suffering
and
desolation
resulting
from
these
weary
internecine
wars
can
only
be
paralleled
by
such
conflicts
as
that
between
the
white
and
red
roses
in
england
or
the
thirty
years
war
in
germany
of
these
struggles
it
will
be
possible
to
give
only
an
outline
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
the
taira
family
sprang
from
the
emperor
kwammu
whose
takamochi
received
permission
to
take
taira
as
his
family
name
the
emperor
shirakawa
tired
of
the
arrogance
of
the
fujiwara
in
retired
into
a
cloister
and
from
this
seclusion
continued
to
exercise
a
controlling
influence
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
tadamori
a
descendant
of
was
a
favorite
in
his
court
and
even
had
a
with
one
of
his
concubines
the
complaisantly
informed
the
courtier
that
if
the
child
to
be
born
proved
to
be
a
daughter
he
himself
would
adopt
it
but
if
a
son
then
it
should
belong
to
tadamori
accordingly
the
child
being
a
son
was
a
taira
and
rose
to
great
eminence
as
tadamori
acquired
for
himself
great
credit
by
his
successful
expedition
against
korean
pirates
who
had
cruised
along
the
eastern
coasts
of
japan
in
the
troubles
which
subsequently
arose
in
reference
to
the
succession
the
taira
took
an
important
part
the
emperor
toba
who
succeeded
to
the
throne
in
at
the
age
of
six
abdicated
in
at
the
age
of
both
his
father
the
horikawa
and
his
grandfather
the
shirakawa
were
still
living
in
retirement
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
the
emperor
shutoku
in
then
six
years
old
who
after
reigning
seventeen
years
abdicated
he
had
a
son
but
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
konoye
who
was
four
years
of
age
this
mature
youth
reigned
thirteen
years
and
died
without
abdicating
on
his
he
adopted
as
the
crown
prince
his
brother
thus
displacing
the
lineal
heir
the
succession
was
now
bitterly
disputed
the
minamoto
chiefly
espoused
the
cause
of
the
displaced
heir
while
kiyomori
and
the
taira
together
with
supported
in
a
battle
fought
kyomori
won
the
victory
this
victory
raised
him
to
a
pinnacle
of
power
he
began
a
career
of
nepotism
and
patronage
which
was
not
inferior
to
that
of
the
fujiwara
the
shutoku
and
his
son
were
banished
to
the
province
of
sanuki
where
it
is
said
that
shutoku
died
of
starvation
tametomo
a
member
of
the
minamoto
clan
who
was
famed
for
his
great
strength
and
for
his
skill
in
archery
was
sent
as
an
exile
to
the
island
of
hachijō
southeast
of
the
promontory
of
izu
from
this
island
he
escaped
and
it
is
a
tradition
that
he
made
his
way
to
the
ryūkyū
islands
where
he
rose
to
prominence
and
became
the
ancestor
of
the
kings
of
these
islands
yoshitomo
of
the
minamoto
clan
who
had
sided
with
kiyomori
in
the
recent
dynastic
conflict
was
a
brother
of
the
tametomo
just
mentioned
he
was
greatly
offended
by
the
violent
use
which
kiyomori
made
of
the
power
which
had
come
into
his
hands
with
all
the
minamoto
and
fujiwara
he
conspired
to
overthrow
the
victorious
and
arrogant
taira
but
kiyomori
suspecting
the
plans
of
his
enemies
took
measures
to
counteract
them
and
suddenly
fell
upon
them
in
the
city
of
kyōto
yoshitomo
was
obliged
to
save
himself
by
fleeing
to
owari
where
he
was
assassinated
by
the
agents
of
kiyomori
the
death
of
the
head
of
the
minamoto
only
made
the
tyrant
more
determined
to
crush
all
opposition
even
the
who
was
a
of
kiyomori
but
who
showed
some
signs
of
disapproval
was
sent
into
exile
several
of
the
sons
of
yoshitomo
were
put
to
death
but
yoritomo
then
a
boy
of
thirteen
was
saved
by
the
interference
of
the
of
kiyomori
and
was
sent
into
exile
in
the
province
of
izu
and
put
into
the
of
two
faithful
taira
men
one
of
whom
hōjō
tokimasa
will
be
heard
of
hereafter
besides
the
four
sons
of
yoshitomo
by
his
wife
he
had
also
three
sons
by
a
concubine
named
tokiwa
she
was
a
woman
of
great
beauty
and
for
that
reason
as
well
as
because
she
was
the
mother
of
the
romantic
hero
yoshitsuné
she
has
often
been
chosen
by
japanese
artists
as
the
subject
of
their
pictures
tokiwa
and
her
three
children
of
whom
yoshitsuné
was
then
an
infant
at
the
breast
fled
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
storm
upon
yoshitomo
and
the
minamoto
clan
they
are
often
represented
as
wandering
through
a
storm
of
snow
yoshitsuné
being
carried
as
an
infant
on
the
back
of
his
mother
and
the
other
two
little
ones
pattering
along
with
unequal
steps
at
her
side
in
this
forlorn
condition
they
were
met
by
one
of
the
taira
soldiers
who
took
pity
on
them
and
gave
them
shelter
from
him
they
learned
that
kiyomori
had
taken
the
mother
of
tokiwa
prisoner
and
held
her
in
confinement
knowing
that
this
would
surely
bring
back
to
him
the
fair
fugitive
and
her
children
in
the
chinese
teachings
of
that
day
in
which
tokiwa
had
been
educated
the
duty
of
a
child
to
its
mother
was
paramount
to
that
of
a
mother
to
her
child
so
tokiwa
felt
that
it
was
unquestionably
her
duty
to
go
back
at
once
to
the
capital
and
surrender
herself
in
order
to
procure
the
release
of
her
mother
but
her
maternal
heart
rebelled
when
she
remembered
that
her
babes
would
surely
be
sacrificed
by
this
devotion
her
woman
s
wit
devised
a
scheme
which
might
possibly
furnish
a
way
between
these
terrible
alternatives
she
determined
to
surrender
herself
and
her
children
to
kiyomori
and
depend
upon
her
beauty
to
save
them
from
the
fate
which
had
been
pronounced
upon
all
the
minamoto
so
with
her
little
flock
she
went
back
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
implacable
tyrant
softened
by
her
beauty
and
urged
by
a
number
of
his
courtiers
he
set
her
mother
at
liberty
in
exchange
for
her
becoming
his
concubine
and
distributed
her
children
in
separate
monasteries
the
chief
interest
follows
the
youngest
boy
yoshitsuné
who
was
sent
to
the
monastery
at
kurama
yama
near
kyōto
here
he
grew
up
a
vigorous
and
active
youth
more
devoted
to
woodcraft
archery
and
fencing
than
to
the
studies
and
devotions
of
the
monastery
at
sixteen
years
of
age
he
was
urged
by
the
priests
to
become
a
monk
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
praying
for
the
soul
of
his
father
but
he
refused
and
shortly
after
he
escaped
from
the
monastery
in
company
with
a
merchant
who
was
about
to
visit
the
northern
provinces
yoshitsuné
reached
mutsu
where
he
entered
the
service
of
then
governor
of
the
province
here
he
spent
several
years
devoting
himself
to
the
military
duties
which
chiefly
pertained
to
the
government
of
that
rough
and
barbarous
province
he
developed
into
the
gallant
and
accomplished
soldier
who
played
a
principal
part
in
the
wars
which
followed
and
became
the
national
hero
around
whose
name
have
clustered
the
choicest
traditions
of
his
country
meanwhile
as
we
have
seen
yoritomo
the
oldest
son
of
yoshitomo
and
by
inheritance
the
head
of
the
minamoto
clan
had
been
banished
to
izu
and
committed
to
the
care
of
two
faithful
taira
adherents
yoritomo
married
masago
the
daughter
of
hōjō
tokimasa
one
of
these
and
found
means
to
induce
tokimasa
to
join
him
in
his
plans
to
overthrow
the
tyrant
kiyomori
who
now
ruled
the
empire
with
relentless
severity
even
the
retired
emperor
joined
in
this
conspiracy
and
wrote
letters
to
yoritomo
urging
him
to
lead
in
the
attempt
to
put
down
the
taira
yoritomo
summoned
the
scattered
members
of
the
minamoto
clan
and
all
the
disaffected
elements
of
every
kind
to
his
assistance
it
does
not
seem
that
this
summons
was
responded
to
with
the
alacrity
which
was
hoped
for
the
inexperience
of
yoritomo
and
the
power
and
resources
of
him
against
whom
they
were
called
upon
to
array
themselves
led
the
scattered
enemies
of
kiyomori
to
hesitate
to
join
so
hopeless
a
cause
the
rendezvous
of
the
minamoto
was
at
ishibashi
yama
and
it
is
said
that
only
three
hundred
men
gathered
at
the
call
they
were
followed
and
attacked
by
a
greatly
superior
force
and
utterly
routed
it
is
a
tradition
that
yoritomo
and
six
friends
who
had
escaped
from
the
slaughter
of
this
battle
hid
themselves
in
the
hollow
of
an
immense
tree
their
pursuers
in
searching
for
them
sent
one
of
their
number
to
examine
this
tree
he
was
secretly
a
friend
of
the
minamoto
and
when
he
discovered
the
fugitives
he
told
them
to
remain
and
announced
to
those
who
sent
him
that
the
tree
was
empty
he
even
inserted
his
spear
into
the
hollow
and
turned
it
about
to
show
that
there
was
nothing
there
when
he
did
this
two
doves
flew
out
and
the
artful
soldier
reported
that
spiders
webs
were
in
the
mouth
of
the
opening
yoritomo
now
fled
to
the
promontory
of
awa
east
of
what
became
known
afterward
as
yedo
bay
he
sent
messages
in
every
direction
summoning
the
enemies
of
kiyomori
to
join
him
his
brother
yoshitsuné
gathered
what
forces
he
could
from
the
north
and
marched
to
the
region
which
was
to
become
famous
as
the
site
of
kamakura
he
was
joined
by
others
of
his
clan
and
soon
felt
himself
in
such
a
position
as
to
assume
the
aggressive
he
fixed
upon
kamakura
as
his
headquarters
about
and
as
his
power
increased
it
grew
to
be
a
great
city
it
was
difficult
of
access
from
kyōto
and
by
fortifying
the
pass
of
hakoné
where
the
mountainous
regions
of
shinano
come
down
to
the
eastern
coast
not
far
from
fujisan
it
was
rendered
safe
from
attacks
coming
from
the
south
while
these
notes
of
preparation
were
being
sounded
kiyomori
who
as
had
ruled
the
empire
for
many
years
died
at
the
age
of
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
portentous
clouds
which
were
gathering
around
his
family
on
his
he
is
said
to
have
warned
them
of
the
danger
arising
from
the
plans
of
yoritomo
according
to
the
he
said
my
regret
is
only
that
i
am
dying
and
have
not
yet
seen
the
head
of
yoritomo
of
the
minamoto
after
my
decease
do
not
make
offerings
to
buddha
on
my
behalf
nor
read
sacred
books
only
cut
off
the
head
of
yoritomo
of
the
minamoto
and
hang
it
on
my
the
death
of
kiyomori
hastened
the
triumph
of
yoritomo
munemori
the
son
of
kiyomori
became
the
head
of
the
taira
clan
and
continued
the
contest
but
yoritomo
s
combinations
speedily
reduced
the
country
to
his
power
yoshitsuné
with
his
army
from
the
north
was
at
kamakura
yoshinaka
a
cousin
of
yoritomo
was
in
command
of
an
army
gathered
in
the
highlands
of
shinano
while
yoritomo
himself
led
the
forces
collected
in
awa
kazusa
and
musashi
the
point
to
which
all
the
armies
were
directed
was
the
capital
where
the
taira
were
still
in
full
control
yoshinaka
was
the
first
to
come
in
collision
with
the
forces
of
the
capital
munemori
had
sent
out
an
army
to
oppose
yoshinaka
who
was
swiftly
approaching
along
the
nakasendō
the
taira
army
was
completely
defeated
and
yoshinaka
marched
victoriously
into
the
capital
munemori
with
the
reigning
emperor
antoku
then
only
a
child
six
years
of
age
and
all
the
imperial
court
crossed
the
inland
sea
to
sanuki
the
northern
province
of
the
island
of
shikoku
the
two
retired
emperors
and
takakura
who
sympathized
with
the
revolutionary
movements
of
yoritomo
remained
behind
and
welcomed
yoshinaka
to
the
capital
the
retirement
of
the
emperor
from
the
palace
was
taken
as
his
abdication
and
his
younger
brother
then
seven
years
old
was
proclaimed
emperor
yoshinaka
puffed
up
by
his
rapid
success
and
disregarding
the
paramount
position
of
yoritomo
assumed
the
superintendence
of
the
government
and
had
himself
appointed
which
was
the
highest
military
title
then
bestowed
upon
a
subject
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
antagonize
yoritomo
and
undertook
to
pluck
the
fruits
of
the
military
movements
which
had
brought
about
this
revolution
of
the
government
yoritomo
at
once
despatched
yoshitsuné
at
the
head
of
his
army
to
kyōto
to
put
down
this
most
unexpected
and
unnatural
defection
he
met
yoshinaka
s
army
near
lake
biwa
and
inflicted
upon
it
a
severe
defeat
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
knowing
that
he
deserved
no
consideration
at
the
hands
of
his
outraged
relatives
yoshinaka
committed
suicide
yoshitsuné
then
followed
the
fugitive
court
he
destroyed
the
taira
palace
at
hyōgo
and
then
crossed
over
to
sanuki
whither
the
court
had
fled
alarmed
by
the
swift
vengeance
which
was
pursuing
them
munemori
together
with
the
emperor
and
his
mother
and
all
the
court
hastily
embarked
for
what
they
hoped
might
be
an
asylum
in
the
island
of
kyūshū
they
were
pursued
by
the
minamoto
army
in
the
junks
which
had
brought
them
to
sanuki
they
were
overtaken
at
not
far
from
the
village
of
shimonoseki
in
the
narrow
straits
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
inland
sea
the
naval
battle
which
here
took
place
is
the
most
famous
in
the
annals
of
the
japanese
empire
according
to
the
the
taira
fleet
consisted
of
five
hundred
junks
and
the
minamoto
of
seven
hundred
the
vessels
of
the
taira
were
encumbered
by
many
women
and
children
of
the
escaping
families
which
put
them
at
a
great
disadvantage
the
young
emperor
with
his
mother
and
grandmother
were
also
the
precious
freight
of
this
fugitive
fleet
of
course
at
this
early
date
the
vessels
which
contended
were
unlike
the
monstrous
which
now
make
naval
warfare
so
stupendous
a
game
they
were
not
even
to
be
compared
with
the
vessels
which
made
up
the
spanish
armada
in
or
the
ships
in
which
the
gallant
british
sailors
repulsed
them
cannon
were
no
part
of
their
armament
the
men
fought
with
bows
and
arrows
and
with
spears
and
swords
it
was
however
a
terrible
fight
between
men
who
felt
that
their
all
was
at
stake
draw
from
this
battle
some
of
their
most
lurid
narratives
and
artists
have
depicted
it
with
realistic
horrors
the
grandmother
of
the
emperor
the
widow
of
kiyomori
seeing
that
escape
was
impossible
took
the
boy
emperor
in
her
arms
and
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
her
daughter
who
was
the
boy
s
mother
she
plunged
into
the
sea
and
both
were
drowned
the
great
mass
of
the
taira
perished
in
this
battle
but
a
remnant
escaped
to
the
island
of
kyūshū
and
hid
themselves
in
the
inaccessible
valleys
of
the
province
of
higo
here
they
have
been
recognized
in
recent
times
and
it
is
claimed
that
they
still
show
the
surly
aversion
to
strangers
which
is
an
inheritance
derived
from
the
necessity
under
which
they
long
rested
to
hide
themselves
from
the
vengeance
which
pursued
them
this
battle
was
decisive
in
the
question
of
supremacy
between
the
taira
and
minamoto
clans
the
same
policy
of
extermination
which
kiyomori
had
pursued
against
the
minamoto
was
now
remorselessly
enforced
by
the
minamoto
against
the
taira
the
prisoners
who
were
taken
in
the
battle
were
executed
to
the
last
man
munemori
was
taken
prisoner
and
decapitated
whenever
a
taira
man
woman
or
child
was
found
death
was
the
inevitable
penalty
inflicted
yoritomo
stationed
his
hōjō
tokimasa
at
kyōto
to
search
out
and
eradicate
his
enemies
as
well
as
to
supervise
the
affairs
of
the
government
it
will
be
remembered
that
a
mere
child
only
seven
years
of
age
had
been
put
on
the
throne
in
the
place
of
the
fugitive
antoku
now
that
the
latter
had
perished
at
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
legitimacy
and
regularity
of
s
accession
the
retired
emperor
who
had
been
a
friend
and
promoter
of
the
schemes
of
yoritomo
was
still
alive
and
rendered
important
aid
in
the
of
the
government
the
darkest
blot
upon
the
character
of
yoritomo
is
his
treatment
of
his
youngest
brother
yoshitsuné
it
was
he
who
had
by
his
generalship
and
gallantry
brought
these
terrible
wars
to
a
triumphant
conclusion
he
had
crushed
in
the
decisive
battle
of
the
last
of
the
enemies
of
yoritomo
with
his
victorious
troops
he
marched
northward
and
with
prisoners
and
captured
standards
was
on
his
way
to
lay
them
at
the
feet
of
his
now
triumphant
brother
at
kamakura
but
the
demon
of
jealousy
had
taken
possession
of
yoritomo
he
resented
the
success
and
fame
of
his
more
winning
and
heroic
brother
he
sent
orders
to
him
not
to
enter
kamakura
and
to
give
up
his
trophies
of
battle
at
koshigoye
near
to
enoshima
here
at
the
monastery
of
mampukuji
is
still
kept
the
draft
of
the
touching
letter
which
he
sent
to
his
brother
protesting
his
loyalty
and
denying
the
charges
of
ambition
and
which
had
been
made
against
him
but
all
this
availed
nothing
yoshitsuné
returned
to
kyōto
and
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
from
the
machinations
of
his
brother
made
his
escape
with
his
faithful
servant
benkei
into
his
old
asylum
with
his
friend
fujiwara
hidehira
the
governor
of
mutsu
shortly
after
his
arrival
however
hidehira
died
and
his
son
yasuhira
abjectly
connived
at
his
assassination
with
a
view
to
secure
yoritomo
s
favor
he
was
at
the
time
of
his
death
only
thirty
years
of
age
he
has
lived
down
to
the
present
time
in
the
admiring
affection
of
a
warlike
and
heroic
people
although
yoritomo
is
looked
upon
as
perhaps
their
greatest
hero
yet
their
admiration
is
always
coupled
with
a
concerning
his
cruel
treatment
of
his
brother
in
order
not
to
rest
under
the
imputation
of
having
encouraged
this
assassination
yoritomo
marched
at
the
head
of
a
strong
force
and
inflicted
punishment
upon
yasuhira
for
having
done
what
he
himself
desired
but
dared
not
directly
authorize
the
way
was
now
clear
for
yoritomo
to
establish
a
system
of
government
which
should
secure
to
him
and
his
family
the
fruits
of
his
long
contest
in
he
went
up
to
the
capital
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
emperor
as
well
as
to
the
veteran
retired
emperor
the
latter
was
now
in
his
year
and
had
held
his
place
through
five
successive
reigns
and
was
now
the
friend
and
patron
of
the
new
government
he
died
however
only
two
years
later
yoritomo
knew
the
effect
produced
by
a
magnificent
display
and
therefore
made
his
progress
to
the
capital
with
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
which
he
could
command
the
festivities
were
kept
up
for
a
month
and
the
court
and
its
surroundings
were
deeply
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
power
and
irresistible
authority
of
the
head
of
the
minamoto
clan
yoritomo
did
not
however
choose
to
establish
himself
at
kyōto
amid
the
atmosphere
of
effeminacy
which
surrounded
the
court
after
his
official
visit
during
which
every
honor
and
rank
which
could
be
bestowed
by
the
emperor
were
showered
upon
his
head
and
all
his
family
and
friends
he
returned
to
his
own
chosen
seat
at
kamakura
here
he
busied
himself
in
perfecting
a
system
which
while
it
would
perpetuate
his
own
power
would
also
build
up
a
firm
national
government
his
first
step
was
to
establish
a
council
at
which
affairs
of
state
were
discussed
and
which
furnished
a
medium
through
which
the
administration
might
be
conducted
the
president
of
this
council
was
its
jurisdiction
pertained
at
first
to
the
is
to
the
part
of
the
country
east
of
the
hakoné
barrier
this
region
was
more
completely
under
the
control
of
the
minamoto
and
therefore
could
be
more
easily
and
surely
submitted
to
administrative
methods
he
also
established
a
criminal
tribunal
to
take
cognizance
of
robberies
and
other
crimes
which
during
the
lawless
and
violent
disturbances
in
the
country
had
largely
prevailed
but
the
step
which
was
destined
to
produce
the
most
results
consisted
in
his
obtaining
from
the
emperor
the
appointment
of
five
of
his
own
family
as
governors
of
provinces
promising
on
his
part
to
supervise
their
actions
and
to
be
responsible
for
the
due
performance
of
their
duty
up
to
this
time
the
governors
and
of
provinces
had
always
been
appointed
from
civil
life
and
were
taken
from
the
families
surrounding
the
imperial
court
he
also
was
authorized
to
send
into
each
province
a
military
man
who
was
to
reside
there
to
aid
the
governor
in
military
affairs
naturally
the
military
man
being
the
more
active
gradually
absorbed
much
of
the
power
formerly
exercised
by
the
governor
these
military
men
were
under
the
authority
of
yoritomo
and
formed
the
beginning
of
that
feudal
system
which
was
destined
to
prevail
so
long
in
japan
he
also
received
from
the
court
shortly
after
his
visit
to
kyōto
the
title
of
which
was
the
highest
military
title
which
had
ever
been
bestowed
on
a
subject
this
is
the
title
which
down
to
was
borne
by
the
real
rulers
of
japan
the
possession
of
the
power
implied
by
this
title
enabled
yoritomo
to
introduce
responsible
government
into
the
almost
ungoverned
districts
of
the
empire
and
to
give
to
japan
for
the
first
time
in
many
centuries
a
semblance
of
peace
there
were
also
many
minor
matters
of
administration
which
yoritomo
in
the
few
remaining
years
of
his
life
put
in
order
he
obtained
from
the
emperor
permission
to
levy
a
tax
on
the
agricultural
products
of
the
country
from
which
he
defrayed
the
expenses
of
the
military
government
he
established
tribunals
for
the
hearing
and
determining
of
causes
and
thus
secured
justice
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
he
forbade
the
priests
and
monks
in
the
great
buddhist
monasteries
who
had
become
powerful
and
arrogant
to
bear
arms
or
to
harbor
those
bearing
arms
illustration
yoritomo
in
all
these
administrative
reforms
yoritomo
was
careful
always
to
secure
the
assent
and
authority
of
the
imperial
court
in
no
case
did
he
assume
or
exercise
independent
authority
in
this
way
was
introduced
at
this
time
that
system
of
dual
government
which
continued
until
the
resignation
of
the
tokugawa
shōgun
in
after
his
first
visit
to
kyōto
in
yoritomo
devoted
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
to
the
confirmation
of
his
power
and
the
encouragement
of
the
arts
of
peace
in
he
made
a
second
magnificent
visit
to
kyōto
and
remained
four
months
it
is
because
of
these
peaceful
results
which
followed
the
long
internecine
struggles
that
the
japanese
regard
yoritomo
as
one
of
their
most
eminent
and
notable
men
under
the
influence
of
his
court
kamakura
grew
to
be
a
great
city
and
far
outranked
even
kyōto
in
power
and
activity
though
not
in
size
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
when
returning
from
the
inspection
of
a
new
bridge
over
the
sagami
river
he
had
a
fall
from
his
horse
which
seriously
injured
him
he
died
from
the
effects
of
this
fall
in
the
early
part
of
the
following
year
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
had
wielded
the
unlimited
military
power
for
the
last
fifteen
years
his
death
was
almost
as
much
of
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
japan
as
his
life
had
been
we
shall
see
in
the
chapters
which
follow
the
deplorable
results
of
that
system
of
effeminacy
and
nepotism
of
abdication
and
regency
which
yoritomo
had
to
resist
and
which
had
he
lived
twenty
years
more
his
country
might
have
escaped
chapter
vii
emperor
and
shōgun
the
death
of
yoritomo
brought
into
prominence
the
very
same
system
which
had
been
the
bane
of
the
imperial
house
during
many
centuries
his
son
and
the
hereditary
successor
to
his
position
and
power
was
yoriiye
then
eighteen
years
of
age
he
was
the
son
of
masago
and
therefore
the
grandson
of
hōjō
tokimasa
who
had
been
yoritomo
s
chief
friend
and
adviser
he
was
an
idle
vicious
boy
and
evinced
no
aptitude
to
carry
on
the
work
of
his
father
in
this
wayward
career
he
was
not
checked
by
his
grandfather
and
is
even
said
to
have
been
encouraged
to
pursue
a
life
of
pleasure
and
gayety
while
the
earnest
work
of
the
government
was
transacted
by
others
tokimasa
assumed
the
duties
of
president
of
the
council
as
well
as
guardian
of
yoriiye
and
in
these
capacities
conducted
the
administration
entirely
according
to
his
own
will
the
appointments
of
position
and
rank
which
the
father
had
received
from
the
emperor
were
in
like
manner
bestowed
upon
the
son
he
was
made
head
of
the
military
administrators
stationed
in
the
several
provinces
and
he
also
received
the
military
title
of
to
which
yoritomo
had
been
appointed
but
these
appointments
were
only
honorary
and
the
duties
pertaining
to
them
were
all
performed
by
the
guardian
of
the
young
man
in
the
year
that
is
in
the
fourth
year
succeeding
yoritomo
s
death
yoriiye
was
taken
sick
and
was
unable
to
fulfil
his
duties
even
in
the
feeble
manner
which
was
customary
his
mother
consulted
with
tokimasa
and
they
agreed
that
yoriiye
should
abdicate
and
surrender
the
headship
of
the
military
administration
to
his
brother
semman
who
was
twelve
years
of
age
and
his
son
ichiman
yoriiye
seems
to
have
resisted
these
suggestions
and
even
resorted
to
force
to
free
himself
from
the
influence
of
the
hōjō
but
tokimasa
was
too
powerful
to
be
so
easily
dispensed
with
yoriiye
was
compelled
to
yield
and
he
retired
to
a
monastery
and
gave
up
his
offices
not
content
with
this
living
retirement
tokimasa
contrived
to
have
him
assassinated
semman
his
brother
was
appointed
and
his
name
changed
to
sanetomo
but
sanetomo
did
not
long
enjoy
his
promotion
because
his
nephew
the
son
of
his
murdered
predecessor
deemed
him
responsible
for
his
father
s
murder
and
took
occasion
to
assassinate
him
then
in
turn
the
nephew
was
put
to
death
for
this
crime
and
thus
by
the
year
the
last
of
the
descendants
of
the
great
yoritomo
had
perished
in
the
meantime
tokimasa
had
retired
to
a
buddhist
monastery
in
his
year
and
in
when
he
was
he
died
the
court
at
kamakura
was
now
prepared
to
go
on
in
its
career
of
effeminacy
after
the
pattern
of
that
at
kyōto
mesago
the
widow
of
yoritomo
and
daughter
of
tokimasa
although
she
too
had
taken
refuge
in
a
buddhist
nunnery
continued
to
exercise
a
ruling
control
in
the
affairs
of
the
government
she
solicited
from
the
court
at
kyōto
the
appointment
of
yoritsuné
a
boy
of
the
fujiwara
family
only
two
years
old
as
in
the
place
of
the
murdered
sanetomo
the
petition
was
granted
and
this
child
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
hōjō
who
as
regents
of
the
shōgun
exercised
with
unlimited
sway
the
authority
of
this
great
office
the
situation
of
affairs
in
japan
at
this
time
was
deplorable
and
were
both
living
in
retirement
as
juntoku
was
the
reigning
emperor
who
was
under
the
influence
and
tutelage
of
the
fretting
under
the
arrogance
of
the
hōjō
undertook
to
resist
their
claims
but
yoshitoku
the
hōjō
regent
at
this
time
quickly
brought
the
kyōto
court
to
terms
by
the
use
of
his
military
power
the
was
compelled
to
become
a
monk
and
was
exiled
to
the
island
of
oki
the
emperor
juntoku
was
forced
to
abdicate
and
was
banished
to
sado
and
a
grandson
of
the
former
emperor
takakura
placed
on
the
throne
even
the
who
had
not
taken
any
part
in
the
conspiracy
was
sent
off
to
the
island
of
shikoku
the
lands
that
had
belonged
to
the
implicated
nobles
were
confiscated
and
distributed
by
yoshitoku
among
his
own
adherents
the
power
of
the
hōjō
family
was
thus
raised
to
its
supreme
point
they
ruled
both
at
kyōto
and
kamakura
with
resistless
authority
they
exercised
at
both
places
this
authority
without
demanding
or
receiving
the
appointment
to
any
of
the
high
positions
which
they
might
have
claimed
they
were
only
the
regents
of
young
and
immature
shōguns
who
were
the
appointees
of
a
court
which
had
at
its
head
an
emperor
without
power
or
influence
and
which
was
controlled
by
the
creatures
of
their
own
designation
this
lamentable
state
of
things
lasted
for
many
years
the
shōguns
during
all
this
time
were
children
sent
from
kyōto
sons
of
emperors
or
connections
of
the
royal
family
the
hōjō
ruled
them
as
well
as
the
country
whenever
it
seemed
best
they
relentlessly
deposed
them
and
set
up
others
in
their
places
in
the
regent
sadatoki
it
is
said
became
irritated
with
one
of
these
shōguns
named
koreyasu
and
in
order
to
show
his
contempt
for
him
had
him
put
in
a
with
his
heels
upward
and
sent
him
under
guard
to
kyōto
some
of
the
hōjō
regents
however
were
men
of
character
and
efficiency
yasutoki
for
instance
who
became
regent
in
was
a
man
of
notable
executive
ability
taking
yoritomo
as
his
model
besides
being
a
soldier
of
tried
capacity
he
was
a
true
friend
of
the
farmer
in
his
seasons
of
famine
and
trial
and
a
promoter
of
legal
reforms
and
of
the
arts
which
found
a
congenial
home
among
the
japanese
but
this
condition
of
affairs
could
not
last
always
the
very
same
influences
which
put
the
real
power
into
the
hands
of
the
regents
were
at
work
to
render
them
unfit
to
continue
to
wield
it
abdication
and
effeminacy
were
gradually
dragging
down
the
hōjō
family
to
the
same
level
as
that
of
the
shōguns
and
emperors
in
tokiyori
then
only
thirty
years
old
resigned
the
regency
in
favor
of
his
son
tokimune
who
was
only
six
years
he
himself
retired
to
a
monastery
from
which
he
travelled
as
a
visiting
monk
throughout
the
country
in
the
meantime
his
son
was
under
the
care
of
a
tutor
nagatoki
who
of
course
was
one
of
the
hōjō
family
thus
it
had
come
about
that
a
tutor
now
controlled
the
regent
who
was
supposed
to
control
the
shōgun
who
was
supposed
to
be
the
vassal
of
the
emperor
who
in
turn
was
generally
a
child
under
the
control
of
a
corrupt
and
venal
court
truly
government
in
japan
had
sunk
to
its
lowest
point
and
it
was
time
for
heroic
remedies
occasionally
in
the
midst
of
this
corruption
and
inefficiency
an
event
occurs
which
stirs
up
the
national
enthusiasm
and
makes
us
feel
that
there
is
still
left
an
element
of
heroism
which
will
ultimately
redeem
the
nation
from
impending
ruin
such
was
the
mongolian
invasion
of
japan
in
according
to
accounts
given
by
marco
polo
who
evidently
narrates
the
exaggerated
gossip
of
the
chinese
court
kublai
khan
had
at
this
time
conquered
the
sung
dynasty
in
china
and
reigned
with
unexampled
magnificence
he
had
heard
of
the
wealth
of
japan
and
deemed
it
an
easy
matter
to
add
this
island
empire
to
his
immense
dominions
his
first
step
was
to
despatch
an
embassy
to
the
japanese
court
to
demand
the
subjection
of
the
country
to
his
authority
this
embassy
was
referred
to
kamakura
whence
it
was
indignantly
dismissed
finally
he
sent
an
invading
force
in
a
large
number
of
chinese
and
korean
vessels
who
took
possession
of
tsushima
an
island
belonging
to
japan
and
lying
midway
between
korea
and
japan
trusting
to
the
effects
of
this
success
a
new
embassy
was
sent
which
was
brought
before
the
hōjō
regent
at
kamakura
the
spot
on
the
seashore
is
still
pointed
out
where
these
imperious
ambassadors
were
put
to
death
and
thus
a
denial
which
could
not
be
misunderstood
was
given
to
the
demands
of
the
grand
khan
a
great
invading
force
which
the
japanese
put
at
a
hundred
thousand
men
was
immediately
sent
in
more
than
three
hundred
vessels
who
landed
upon
the
island
of
kyūshū
this
army
was
met
and
defeated
by
tokimune
and
a
timely
typhoon
coming
to
their
aid
the
fleet
of
vessels
was
completely
destroyed
thus
the
only
serious
attempt
at
the
invasion
of
japan
which
has
ever
been
made
was
completely
frustrated
but
notwithstanding
this
heroic
episode
the
affairs
of
japan
remained
in
the
same
deplorable
condition
as
a
rule
children
continued
to
occupy
the
imperial
throne
and
to
abdicate
whenever
their
hōjō
masters
deemed
it
best
children
of
the
imperial
house
or
of
the
family
of
fujiwara
were
sent
to
kamakura
to
become
shōguns
and
now
at
last
the
hōjō
regency
had
by
successive
steps
come
down
to
the
same
level
and
children
were
made
regents
whose
actions
and
conduct
were
controlled
by
their
inferiors
in
the
midst
of
this
state
of
things
which
continued
till
became
emperor
contrary
to
the
ordinary
usage
he
was
a
man
years
old
in
the
full
maturity
of
his
powers
he
was
by
no
means
free
from
the
vices
to
which
his
surroundings
inevitably
tended
he
was
fond
of
the
gayety
and
pomp
which
the
court
had
always
cultivated
but
he
realized
the
depth
of
the
degradation
to
which
the
present
condition
of
affairs
had
dragged
his
country
a
famine
brought
great
suffering
upon
the
people
and
the
efforts
which
the
emperor
made
to
assist
them
added
to
his
popularity
and
revealed
to
him
the
reverence
in
which
the
imperial
throne
was
held
his
son
moriyoshi
as
early
as
was
implicated
in
plans
against
the
hōjō
which
they
discovered
and
in
consequence
compelled
to
order
his
retirement
into
a
monastery
later
undertook
to
make
a
stand
against
the
arrogance
and
intolerance
of
the
hōjō
and
induced
the
buddhist
monks
to
join
him
in
fortifying
kasagi
in
the
province
of
yamato
but
this
effort
of
the
emperor
was
fruitless
kasagi
was
attacked
and
destroyed
and
the
emperor
taken
prisoner
as
a
punishment
for
his
attempt
he
was
sent
as
an
exile
to
the
island
of
oki
the
hōjō
regent
takatoki
put
on
the
throne
as
emperor
but
from
his
exile
continued
his
exertions
against
the
hōjō
and
assistance
came
to
him
from
unexpected
quarters
he
effected
his
escape
from
the
island
and
having
raised
an
army
marched
upon
kyōto
kusunoki
masashigé
who
had
given
his
aid
to
the
emperor
on
former
occasions
now
exerted
himself
to
good
purpose
he
is
held
in
admiring
remembrance
to
this
day
by
his
grateful
country
as
the
model
of
patriotic
devotion
to
whom
his
emperor
was
dearer
than
his
life
another
character
who
stands
out
prominently
in
this
trying
time
was
nitta
yoshisada
he
was
a
descendant
of
yoshiiye
who
for
his
achievements
against
the
emishi
had
received
the
popular
title
of
nitta
was
a
commander
in
the
army
of
the
hōjō
which
had
been
sent
against
kusunoki
masashigé
but
at
the
last
moment
he
refused
to
fight
against
the
army
of
the
emperor
and
retired
with
his
troops
and
went
over
to
the
side
of
masashigé
he
returned
to
his
own
province
of
kōtsuke
and
raised
an
army
to
fight
against
the
hōjō
with
this
force
he
marched
at
once
against
kamakura
through
the
province
of
sagami
his
route
lay
along
the
beach
but
at
the
high
ground
which
is
impassable
for
troops
juts
out
so
far
into
the
water
that
nitta
was
unable
to
lead
them
past
the
promontory
alone
he
clambered
up
the
mountain
path
and
looked
out
upon
the
sea
that
lay
in
his
way
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
that
he
could
not
bring
his
force
in
time
to
share
in
the
attack
upon
the
hateful
hōjō
capital
he
prayed
to
the
to
withdraw
the
sea
and
allow
him
to
pass
with
his
troops
then
he
flung
his
sword
into
the
waves
in
token
of
his
earnestness
and
of
the
dire
necessity
in
which
he
found
himself
thereupon
the
tide
retreated
and
left
a
space
of
a
mile
and
a
half
along
which
nitta
marched
upon
kamakura
the
attack
was
spirited
and
was
made
from
three
directions
simultaneously
it
was
resisted
with
determined
valor
on
the
part
of
the
hōjō
the
city
was
finally
set
on
fire
by
nitta
and
in
a
few
hours
was
reduced
to
ashes
thus
the
power
and
the
arrogant
tyranny
of
the
hōjō
family
were
sealed
it
had
lasted
from
the
death
of
yoritomo
to
the
destruction
of
kamakura
in
all
one
hundred
and
years
it
was
a
rough
and
tempestuous
time
and
the
hōjō
have
left
a
name
in
their
country
of
unexampled
cruelty
and
rapacity
the
most
unpardonable
crime
of
which
they
were
guilty
was
that
of
raising
their
sacrilegious
hands
against
the
emperor
and
making
war
against
the
imperial
standard
for
this
they
must
rest
under
the
charge
of
treason
and
no
merits
however
great
or
commanding
can
ever
excuse
them
in
the
eyes
of
their
patriotic
countrymen
the
restoration
of
to
the
imperial
throne
under
so
popular
an
uprising
seemed
to
betoken
a
return
to
the
old
and
simple
system
of
japanese
government
the
intervention
of
a
shōgun
between
the
emperor
and
his
people
which
had
lasted
from
the
time
of
yoritomo
was
contrary
to
the
precedents
which
had
prevailed
from
the
emperor
jimmu
down
to
that
time
it
was
the
hope
and
wish
of
the
best
friends
of
the
government
at
this
time
to
go
back
to
the
original
precedents
and
govern
the
country
directly
from
kyōto
with
the
power
and
authority
derived
from
the
emperor
but
the
emperor
was
not
equal
to
so
radical
a
change
from
the
methods
which
had
prevailed
for
more
than
a
century
he
gave
great
offence
by
the
manner
in
which
he
distributed
the
forfeited
fiefs
among
those
who
had
aided
his
restoration
to
ashikaga
he
awarded
by
far
the
greatest
prize
while
to
kusunoki
and
nitta
who
had
in
the
popular
estimation
done
much
more
for
him
he
allotted
comparatively
small
rewards
among
the
soldiers
who
in
the
long
civil
wars
had
lost
the
ability
to
devote
themselves
to
peaceful
industries
this
disappointment
was
most
conspicuous
they
had
expected
to
be
rewarded
with
lands
and
subordinate
places
which
would
enable
them
to
live
in
that
feudal
comfort
to
which
they
deemed
their
exertions
had
entitled
them
at
this
time
a
feud
broke
out
between
ashikaga
and
nitta
the
former
had
accused
nitta
of
unfaithfulness
to
his
emperor
and
nitta
was
able
to
disprove
the
charge
he
received
the
imperial
commission
to
punish
ashikaga
and
marched
with
his
army
upon
him
in
the
province
of
tōtōmi
in
the
battles
which
ensued
the
forces
of
ashikaga
were
completely
victorious
the
emperor
and
his
court
were
obliged
to
flee
from
kyōto
and
took
up
their
residence
in
a
buddhist
temple
at
yoshino
in
the
mountainous
district
south
of
kyōto
this
was
the
same
monastery
where
yoshitsuné
and
benkei
had
taken
refuge
previous
to
their
escape
into
mutsu
almost
every
tree
and
every
rock
in
the
picturesque
grounds
of
this
romantic
spot
bear
some
evidence
of
the
one
or
other
of
these
memorable
refugees
the
southern
dynasty
lasted
in
all
years
down
to
and
although
it
was
compelled
to
starve
out
a
miserable
existence
in
exile
from
the
capital
it
is
yet
looked
upon
by
historians
as
the
legitimate
branch
while
the
northern
dynasty
which
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
palace
and
of
the
capital
is
condemned
as
illegitimate
this
period
of
exile
witnessed
many
notable
events
in
the
bloody
history
of
the
country
ashikaga
was
of
course
the
ruling
spirit
while
he
lived
he
proclaimed
that
had
forfeited
the
throne
and
put
kōmyō
tennō
a
brother
of
kōgen
tennō
upon
it
in
his
stead
the
insignia
of
the
imperial
power
were
in
the
possession
of
but
kōmyō
being
supported
by
the
battalions
of
ashikaga
cared
little
for
these
empty
baubles
the
bloody
sequence
of
affairs
brought
with
it
the
death
of
the
heroic
kusunoki
masashige
he
with
nitta
and
other
patriots
had
undertaken
to
support
it
is
said
that
contrary
to
his
military
judgment
he
attacked
the
forces
of
ashikaga
which
were
vastly
superior
in
number
the
battle
took
place
on
the
near
the
present
site
of
hyōgo
the
ashikaga
forces
had
cut
off
kusunoki
with
a
small
band
of
devoted
followers
from
the
main
army
seeing
that
his
situation
was
hopeless
and
that
his
brave
troops
must
be
destroyed
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
that
were
left
of
his
little
retired
to
a
farmer
s
house
near
by
and
there
they
all
committed
kusunoki
masashige
when
about
to
commit
suicide
said
to
his
son
masatsura
for
the
sake
of
keeping
yourself
out
of
danger
s
way
or
of
reaping
some
temporal
advantage
on
no
account
are
you
to
submit
to
by
so
doing
you
would
bring
reproach
on
our
name
while
there
is
a
man
left
who
belongs
to
us
let
our
flag
be
hoisted
over
the
battlements
of
mount
konzo
as
a
sign
that
we
are
still
ready
to
fight
in
the
emperor
s
a
little
later
than
this
in
the
great
companion
and
friend
of
kusunoki
nitta
yoshisada
came
to
his
end
he
had
undertaken
to
promote
the
cause
of
the
emperor
in
the
northwestern
provinces
by
with
nitta
with
about
fifty
followers
was
unexpectedly
attacked
by
ashikaga
tadatsune
with
three
thousand
men
near
fukui
in
the
province
of
echizen
there
was
no
way
of
escape
with
his
little
troop
in
this
condition
he
was
urged
to
secure
his
personal
safety
but
he
refused
to
survive
his
comrades
then
he
rode
with
his
brave
company
upon
the
enemy
until
his
horse
was
disabled
and
he
himself
was
pierced
in
the
eye
with
an
arrow
he
drew
out
the
arrow
with
his
own
hand
and
then
in
order
that
his
body
might
not
be
identified
with
his
sword
cut
off
his
own
head
at
least
so
it
is
said
each
member
of
his
troop
followed
this
grewsome
example
and
it
was
only
after
examining
the
bodies
of
these
headless
corpses
and
the
finding
upon
one
a
commission
from
the
emperor
that
the
remains
of
the
heroic
nitta
were
recognized
the
head
was
sent
to
kyōto
and
there
exposed
by
the
ashikaga
commander
and
the
body
was
buried
near
the
place
where
the
tragic
death
occurred
the
ashikaga
family
had
now
the
uninterrupted
control
of
affairs
they
resided
at
kyōto
and
inherited
in
succession
the
office
of
shōgun
the
founder
of
the
ashikaga
shōgunate
and
who
had
held
the
office
from
died
in
when
about
years
old
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
yoshinori
who
was
shōgun
from
to
having
retired
he
was
succeeded
by
his
grandson
yoshimitsu
who
in
turn
retired
in
favor
of
his
son
yoshimotsu
by
this
time
the
precedents
of
abdication
and
effeminacy
began
to
tell
upon
the
ashikaga
successors
and
like
all
the
preceding
ruling
families
it
gradually
sank
into
the
usual
insignificance
some
of
the
ashikaga
shōguns
however
were
men
of
uncommon
ability
and
their
services
to
their
country
deserve
to
be
gratefully
remembered
a
number
of
them
were
men
of
culture
and
evinced
their
love
of
elegance
and
refinement
by
the
palaces
which
they
built
in
kyōto
ashikaga
yoshimitsu
was
shōgun
from
to
and
at
the
latter
date
retired
in
favor
of
his
young
son
yoshimotsu
but
lived
in
official
retirement
in
kyōto
till
he
built
the
palace
now
known
as
the
buddhist
monastery
kinkakuji
its
name
is
derived
from
golden
pavilion
which
yoshimitsu
erected
the
whole
palace
was
bequeathed
by
him
to
the
zen
sect
of
buddhists
and
is
still
one
of
the
sights
best
worth
seeing
in
kyōto
yoshimitsu
has
been
visited
by
much
obloquy
because
he
accepted
from
the
chinese
government
the
title
of
king
of
japan
and
pledged
himself
to
the
payment
of
one
thousand
ounces
of
gold
as
a
yearly
tribute
it
is
said
in
explanation
of
this
tribute
that
it
was
to
compensate
for
damages
done
by
japanese
pirates
to
chinese
shipping
but
it
was
probably
negotiated
for
the
purpose
of
securing
an
ambitious
title
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
making
a
troublesome
neighbor
a
tributary
kingdom
another
building
which
takes
its
origin
from
the
ashikaga
is
the
it
was
founded
by
ashikaga
and
contains
carved
and
lacquered
wooden
figures
of
the
ashikaga
shōguns
which
are
believed
in
most
cases
to
be
contemporary
portraits
another
of
the
notable
ashikaga
shōguns
was
yoshimasa
who
held
the
office
from
he
retired
at
the
latter
date
and
lived
as
retired
shōgun
until
in
this
interval
of
seclusion
he
cultivated
the
arts
and
posed
as
the
patron
of
literature
and
painting
that
curious
custom
called
or
tea
ceremonies
is
usually
adjudged
to
him
as
its
originator
but
it
is
most
probable
that
he
only
adopted
and
refined
it
until
it
became
the
fashionable
craze
which
has
come
down
to
modern
times
these
ceremonies
and
his
other
modes
of
amusement
were
conducted
in
a
palace
which
he
had
built
called
silver
pavilion
yoshimasa
left
this
palace
to
the
monks
of
with
directions
that
it
should
be
converted
into
a
monastery
and
in
that
capacity
it
still
serves
at
the
present
time
the
period
of
the
two
imperial
dynasties
lasted
until
when
a
proposition
was
made
by
the
shōgun
yoshimitsu
to
the
then
reigning
emperor
of
the
south
that
the
rivalry
should
be
healed
it
was
agreed
that
of
the
southern
dynasty
should
come
to
kyōto
and
surrender
the
insignia
to
the
ruling
emperor
of
the
northern
dynasty
this
was
duly
accomplished
and
having
handed
over
the
insignia
to
took
the
position
of
retired
emperor
thus
the
long
rivalry
between
the
northern
and
southern
dynasties
was
ended
and
stands
as
the
in
the
official
list
of
emperors
in
that
list
however
none
of
the
other
emperors
of
the
northern
dynasty
appear
they
being
regarded
as
pretenders
and
in
no
case
entitled
to
the
dignity
of
divine
rulers
of
japan
this
settlement
of
dynastic
difficulties
and
the
unrestricted
ascendancy
of
the
ashikaga
shōguns
gave
the
country
a
little
interval
of
peace
the
condition
of
the
peasantry
at
this
time
was
most
deplorable
the
continual
wars
between
neighboring
lords
and
with
the
shōguns
had
kept
in
the
field
armies
of
military
men
who
were
forced
to
subsist
on
contributions
exacted
from
the
tillers
of
the
soil
the
farmers
everywhere
were
kept
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
and
had
little
encouragement
to
cultivate
crops
which
were
almost
sure
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
others
on
the
coasts
of
kyūshū
and
other
islands
facing
towards
the
continent
piracy
also
sprang
up
and
flourished
apace
it
was
indeed
an
era
of
piracy
all
over
the
world
the
portuguese
spanish
and
dutch
traders
of
this
period
were
almost
always
ready
to
turn
an
honest
penny
by
seizing
an
unfortunate
vessel
under
the
pretence
that
it
was
a
pirate
the
whole
coast
of
china
according
to
the
accounts
of
pinto
swarmed
with
both
european
and
asiatic
craft
which
were
either
traders
or
pirates
according
to
circumstances
under
this
state
of
things
and
with
the
pressure
of
lawlessness
and
want
behind
them
it
was
not
surprising
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
western
coasts
of
japan
should
turn
to
a
piratical
life
knowing
the
japanese
only
since
centuries
of
enforced
isolation
had
made
them
unaccustomed
to
creep
beyond
their
own
shores
we
can
scarcely
conceive
of
their
hardihood
and
venturesomeness
during
and
subsequent
to
this
active
period
satow
has
gathered
a
most
interesting
series
of
facts
pertaining
to
the
intercourse
between
japan
and
siam
beginning
at
a
period
as
early
as
that
now
under
review
not
only
did
this
intercourse
consist
in
sending
vessels
laden
with
chattels
for
traffic
but
a
colony
of
japanese
and
a
contingent
of
japanese
troops
formed
part
of
the
assistance
which
japan
furnished
to
her
southern
neighbor
while
these
signs
of
activity
were
apparent
on
the
coast
the
provinces
in
the
interior
were
alive
with
political
unrest
particularly
the
principal
daimyōs
who
had
never
since
the
days
of
yoritomo
felt
a
master
s
power
over
them
took
the
present
occasion
to
extend
their
dominions
over
their
neighbors
for
centuries
the
conflicts
among
them
were
almost
unending
it
is
needless
to
undertake
to
disentangle
the
story
of
their
wars
these
daimyōs
were
a
far
more
distinct
and
pressing
reality
than
the
harmless
emperor
or
even
than
the
shōgun
while
their
ceaseless
civil
wars
rendered
the
condition
of
the
country
so
uncertain
and
so
unsettled
yet
the
authority
of
the
local
rulers
tended
to
preserve
peace
and
dispense
a
rude
kind
of
justice
among
their
own
subjects
thus
while
in
many
parts
of
japan
poverty
and
desolation
had
eaten
up
everything
and
lawlessness
and
robbery
had
put
an
end
to
industry
yet
there
were
some
favored
parts
of
the
islands
where
the
strong
hand
of
the
daimyōs
preserved
for
their
people
the
opportunities
of
life
and
kept
alive
the
chances
of
industry
chapter
viii
from
the
ashikaga
shōguns
to
the
death
of
nobunaga
in
almost
the
worst
period
of
the
ashikaga
anarchy
the
portuguese
made
their
first
appearance
in
japan
galvano
who
had
been
governor
of
the
moluccas
gives
an
account
of
this
first
visit
when
three
fugitives
from
a
portuguese
vessel
in
a
chinese
junk
were
driven
upon
the
islands
of
southern
japan
concerning
the
doings
of
these
fugitives
we
have
no
account
in
any
foreign
narratives
but
fernam
mendez
pinto
in
his
travels
gives
a
detailed
narrative
of
the
visit
which
he
and
his
companions
made
a
few
years
later
in
a
ship
with
a
chinese
captain
and
merchandise
the
exact
year
can
not
be
ascertained
from
pinto
s
narrative
but
hildreth
assumes
that
it
could
not
have
been
earlier
than
pinto
landed
on
an
island
south
of
the
extreme
southern
point
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
they
were
received
with
great
cordiality
by
the
prince
who
evinced
the
utmost
curiosity
concerning
the
portuguese
who
were
on
this
ship
pinto
naïvely
confesses
that
we
rendered
him
answers
as
might
rather
fit
his
humor
than
agree
with
the
truth
that
so
we
might
not
derogate
from
the
great
opinion
he
had
conceived
of
our
as
a
return
for
some
of
the
kindnesses
which
the
prince
showed
them
the
portuguese
gave
him
a
and
explained
to
him
the
method
of
making
powder
the
present
seems
to
have
been
most
acceptable
and
pinto
declares
the
armorers
commenced
at
once
to
make
imitations
of
it
so
that
before
their
departure
which
was
five
months
and
a
half
after
there
were
six
hundred
of
them
made
in
the
and
a
few
years
later
he
was
assured
that
there
were
above
thirty
thousand
in
the
city
of
fucheo
the
capital
of
bungo
and
above
three
hundred
thousand
in
the
whole
province
and
so
they
have
increased
from
this
one
which
they
gave
to
the
prince
of
until
every
hamlet
and
city
in
the
empire
in
a
short
time
were
supplied
with
them
a
short
time
after
their
reception
at
the
prince
of
bungo
who
was
a
relative
of
the
prince
of
sent
for
one
of
the
portuguese
and
pinto
by
his
own
consent
was
selected
as
being
of
a
more
lively
he
was
received
with
great
consideration
and
proved
himself
of
vast
service
in
curing
the
prince
of
gout
with
which
he
was
affected
his
success
in
this
cure
gave
him
immense
repute
and
he
was
initiated
into
all
the
gayeties
and
sports
of
the
prince
s
court
in
particular
he
amused
and
interested
them
all
by
firing
the
matchlock
which
he
had
brought
with
him
a
son
of
the
prince
of
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
of
age
was
infatuated
with
this
sport
and
one
day
unknown
to
pinto
he
undertook
to
load
and
fire
the
matchlock
as
he
had
seen
the
foreigner
do
an
explosion
occurred
by
which
the
young
prince
was
much
injured
and
owing
to
this
pinto
came
near
being
put
to
death
for
having
wrought
this
disaster
but
the
young
prince
had
more
sense
than
the
attendants
and
at
his
request
pinto
was
given
a
chance
to
bind
up
the
wounds
and
take
care
of
him
the
result
was
that
the
young
prince
quickly
recovered
and
the
fame
of
this
cure
was
spread
everywhere
so
that
says
pinto
after
this
sort
i
received
in
recompense
of
this
my
cure
above
fifteen
hundred
ducats
that
i
carried
with
me
from
this
pinto
made
a
second
visit
to
japan
in
the
interests
of
trade
in
which
was
attended
by
a
circumstance
which
had
results
in
critical
circumstances
they
were
called
upon
to
take
off
two
fugitives
who
appealed
to
them
from
the
shore
a
company
of
men
on
horseback
demanded
the
return
of
the
fugitives
but
without
answer
they
pulled
off
to
the
ship
and
took
them
aboard
the
principal
of
these
two
fugitives
was
anjiro
whom
the
jesuits
usually
name
anger
and
his
companion
was
his
servant
they
were
taken
in
the
portuguese
vessel
to
malacca
where
pinto
met
father
francis
xavier
who
had
just
arrived
upon
his
mission
to
the
east
xavier
became
intensely
interested
in
these
japanese
fugitives
and
took
them
to
goa
then
the
principal
seat
of
jesuit
learning
and
the
seat
of
an
archbishopric
in
the
east
indies
here
both
the
japanese
became
converts
and
were
baptized
anjiro
receiving
the
name
of
paulo
de
santa
fé
paul
of
the
holy
faith
and
his
companion
the
name
of
john
they
learned
to
speak
and
write
the
portuguese
language
and
were
instructed
in
the
elements
of
the
christian
religion
with
these
efficient
helps
xavier
was
ready
to
enter
japan
and
commence
the
evangelization
on
which
his
heart
had
long
been
set
at
last
arrangements
were
made
with
a
chinese
vessel
which
according
to
pinto
s
account
was
a
piratical
craft
to
convey
xavier
and
his
companions
to
japan
they
arrived
at
kagoshima
the
capital
of
the
province
of
satsuma
august
besides
xavier
and
his
japanese
companions
there
were
cosme
de
torres
a
priest
and
jean
ferdinand
a
brother
of
the
society
of
jesus
they
were
cordially
received
by
the
prince
of
satsuma
and
after
a
little
permission
was
given
them
to
preach
the
christian
religion
in
the
city
of
kagoshima
the
family
and
relatives
of
anjiro
who
lived
in
kagoshima
were
converted
and
became
the
first
fruits
of
the
mission
in
the
letters
which
xavier
wrote
home
about
this
time
we
have
his
early
impressions
concerning
the
japanese
the
princess
took
great
interest
in
the
subjects
discussed
by
anjiro
and
was
especially
struck
with
a
picture
of
the
madonna
and
child
which
he
showed
her
she
asked
to
have
the
heads
of
the
christian
faith
put
in
writing
in
order
that
she
might
study
them
for
this
reason
a
creed
and
a
catechism
were
prepared
and
translated
into
the
japanese
language
for
the
use
of
the
princess
and
other
enquirers
in
one
of
his
early
letters
he
says
i
really
think
that
among
barbarous
nations
there
can
be
none
that
has
more
natural
goodness
than
in
the
same
letter
he
says
they
are
wonderfully
inclined
to
see
all
that
is
good
and
honest
and
have
an
eagerness
to
xavier
in
letter
narrates
his
meeting
with
the
buddhist
priest
whom
he
calls
which
name
he
says
means
heart
of
truth
this
priest
was
eighty
years
old
and
in
the
conversation
expressed
great
surprise
that
xavier
should
have
come
all
the
way
from
portugal
to
preach
to
the
japanese
the
biographers
of
xavier
have
given
us
the
fullest
details
of
his
life
and
works
that
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
fervent
piety
as
well
as
the
most
conspicuous
ability
is
apparent
from
the
energy
and
success
with
which
he
conducted
his
short
but
brilliant
mission
both
in
their
accounts
of
him
as
well
as
in
the
papal
bull
announcing
his
canonization
the
claim
is
distinctly
set
forth
of
his
possession
of
miraculous
power
he
is
represented
as
having
raised
a
japanese
girl
from
the
dead
as
possessing
the
gift
of
tongues
that
is
as
being
able
to
speak
in
fluent
japanese
although
he
had
not
learned
the
language
as
having
given
an
answer
which
when
heard
was
a
satisfactory
reply
to
the
most
various
and
different
questions
such
as
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
motions
of
the
heavens
the
eclipses
of
the
sun
and
moon
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
sin
and
grace
heaven
and
illustration
francis
xavier
yet
it
must
be
stated
that
xavier
himself
does
not
claim
these
miraculous
powers
indeed
among
the
letters
published
by
father
horace
tursellini
is
one
in
which
he
thus
speaks
of
himself
god
grant
that
as
soon
as
possible
we
may
learn
the
language
of
japan
in
order
to
make
known
the
divine
mysteries
then
we
shall
zealously
prosecute
our
christian
work
for
they
speak
and
discourse
much
about
us
but
we
are
silent
ignorant
of
the
language
of
the
country
at
present
we
are
become
a
child
again
to
learn
the
elements
of
the
the
desire
for
trade
with
the
portuguese
seems
to
have
been
a
principal
reason
for
the
ready
reception
of
the
missionaries
and
when
the
portuguese
merchant
ships
resorted
to
hirado
an
island
off
the
west
coast
of
kyūshū
instead
of
the
less
accessible
kagoshima
the
prince
of
kagoshima
turned
against
the
missionaries
and
forbade
them
from
preaching
and
proselyting
from
kagoshima
xavier
went
to
hirado
where
he
was
received
with
a
salvo
of
artillery
from
a
portuguese
vessel
then
at
anchor
there
here
he
made
a
short
stay
preaching
the
gospel
as
usual
and
with
the
approval
of
the
prince
establishing
a
church
leaving
kosmé
de
torres
at
hirado
and
taking
with
him
fernandez
and
the
two
japanese
assistants
he
touched
at
hakata
famous
as
the
place
where
the
mongol
invaders
were
repulsed
then
he
crossed
over
to
the
main
island
and
travelling
by
land
along
the
sanyōdō
he
entered
yamaguchi
in
the
province
of
nagato
his
humble
and
forlorn
appearance
did
not
produce
a
favorable
impression
on
the
people
of
this
city
and
he
was
driven
out
with
obloquy
he
set
out
for
kyōto
with
a
party
of
japanese
merchants
and
as
it
was
winter
and
xavier
had
to
carry
on
his
back
a
box
containing
the
vestments
and
vessels
for
the
celebration
of
mass
the
journey
was
trying
and
difficult
he
arrived
at
kyōto
in
the
midst
of
great
political
troubles
a
fire
had
destroyed
a
great
part
of
what
had
been
once
a
beautiful
and
luxurious
city
many
of
the
principal
citizens
had
abandoned
it
and
taken
up
their
residence
with
local
princes
in
the
provinces
xavier
could
obtain
a
hearing
neither
from
the
emperor
nor
from
the
ashikaga
shōguns
who
maintained
a
representative
in
the
capital
at
this
time
he
preached
in
the
street
as
he
could
obtain
opportunity
but
the
atmosphere
was
everywhere
unfavorable
and
he
resolved
to
abandon
the
field
for
the
present
accordingly
he
went
back
to
bungo
whence
he
sailed
for
china
november
with
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
mission
he
had
spent
two
years
and
three
months
in
japan
and
left
an
impression
which
has
never
been
effaced
he
died
on
his
way
at
the
little
island
of
sancian
december
aged
his
body
was
carried
to
malacca
and
afterward
to
goa
where
it
was
buried
in
the
archiepiscopal
cathedral
the
departure
and
death
of
xavier
did
not
interrupt
the
work
of
the
mission
in
japan
kosmé
de
torres
was
left
in
charge
and
additional
helpers
both
priests
and
lay
brothers
were
sent
to
prosecute
what
had
been
so
conspicuously
begun
the
political
disturbances
in
yamaguchi
for
a
time
interfered
with
the
labors
of
the
missionaries
there
bungo
was
the
principal
province
where
their
encouragement
had
made
their
success
most
conspicuous
the
prince
had
not
indeed
been
baptized
but
he
had
permitted
the
fathers
to
preach
and
he
had
allowed
converts
to
adopt
the
new
religion
so
that
the
work
had
assumed
a
promising
appearance
the
prince
of
ōmura
became
a
convert
and
by
his
zeal
in
the
destruction
of
idols
and
other
extreme
measures
aroused
the
hostility
of
the
buddhist
priesthood
in
kyōto
the
progress
of
the
work
encountered
many
vicissitudes
the
political
troubles
arising
out
of
the
contests
between
mōri
of
chōshū
and
the
rival
house
interfered
with
the
propagation
of
christianity
both
in
yamaguchi
and
kyōto
mōri
himself
the
most
powerful
prince
of
his
time
and
who
once
held
the
control
in
ten
provinces
was
hostile
to
the
christians
by
his
influence
the
work
in
kyōto
was
temporarily
abandoned
and
the
fathers
resorted
to
sakai
a
seaport
town
not
far
from
ōsaka
where
a
branch
mission
was
established
it
was
in
that
nagasaki
became
distinctively
a
christian
city
at
that
time
the
portuguese
were
seeking
various
ports
in
which
they
could
conduct
a
profitable
trade
and
they
found
that
nagasaki
possessed
a
harbor
in
which
their
largest
ships
could
ride
at
anchor
the
merchants
and
portuguese
fathers
therefore
proposed
to
the
prince
of
ōmura
in
whose
territory
the
port
of
nagasaki
was
situated
to
grant
to
them
the
town
with
jurisdiction
over
it
the
prince
at
first
refused
but
finally
by
the
intervention
of
the
prince
of
arima
the
arrangement
was
made
the
transference
to
nagasaki
of
the
foreign
trade
at
this
early
day
made
it
a
very
prosperous
place
the
prince
of
ōmura
had
the
town
laid
out
in
appropriate
streets
and
christian
churches
were
built
often
on
the
sites
of
buddhist
temples
which
were
torn
down
to
give
place
for
them
it
is
said
that
in
there
was
hardly
a
person
who
was
not
a
we
shall
have
occasion
often
in
the
subsequent
narrative
to
refer
to
the
progress
of
christianity
in
the
empire
in
the
meantime
we
must
trace
the
career
of
nobunaga
who
exerted
a
powerful
effect
on
the
affairs
of
his
country
and
particularly
upon
the
condition
of
both
buddhism
and
christianity
he
must
be
regarded
always
as
one
of
the
great
men
of
japan
who
at
an
opportune
moment
intervened
to
rescue
its
affairs
from
anarchy
he
prepared
the
way
for
hideyoshi
and
he
in
turn
made
it
possible
for
ieyasu
to
establish
a
peace
which
lasted
without
serious
interruption
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ota
nobunaga
was
descended
from
the
taira
family
through
ota
chikazane
a
of
taira
kiyomori
the
father
of
chikazane
had
perished
in
the
wars
between
the
taira
and
minamoto
families
and
his
mother
had
married
as
her
second
husband
the
chief
man
in
the
village
of
tsuda
in
the
province
of
ōmi
the
was
adopted
by
a
shintō
priest
of
the
village
of
ota
in
the
province
of
echizen
and
received
the
name
of
ota
chikazane
when
he
grew
up
he
became
a
shintō
priest
and
married
and
became
the
father
of
a
line
of
priests
one
of
this
succession
was
ota
nobuhide
who
seems
to
have
reverted
from
the
priestly
character
back
to
the
warlike
habits
of
his
ancestors
in
the
general
scramble
for
land
which
characterized
that
period
nobuhide
acquired
by
force
of
arms
considerable
possessions
in
the
province
of
owari
which
at
his
death
in
he
left
to
his
son
ota
nobunaga
this
son
grew
up
to
be
a
man
of
large
stature
but
slender
and
delicate
in
frame
he
was
brave
beyond
the
usual
reckless
bravery
of
his
countrymen
he
was
by
character
and
training
fitted
for
command
and
in
the
multifarious
career
of
his
busy
life
in
expeditions
battles
and
sieges
he
showed
himself
the
consummate
general
like
many
other
men
of
genius
he
was
not
equally
as
skilful
in
civil
as
military
affairs
he
was
ambitious
to
reduce
the
disorders
of
his
country
and
he
was
able
to
see
in
a
great
measure
the
success
of
his
schemes
but
he
failed
in
leaving
when
he
died
any
security
for
the
preservation
and
continuance
of
that
peace
and
unity
which
he
had
conquered
at
the
time
nobunaga
became
prominent
the
emperor
had
died
and
ōgimachi
in
had
just
succeeded
to
the
throne
as
the
one
hundred
and
fifth
emperor
ashikaga
yoshifusa
had
become
shōgun
in
as
a
boy
eleven
years
old
and
was
at
this
time
a
young
man
who
as
usual
devoted
himself
to
pleasure
while
the
affairs
of
government
were
conducted
by
others
both
emperor
and
shōgun
were
almost
powerless
in
the
empire
the
real
power
being
held
by
the
local
princes
in
many
cases
they
had
largely
increased
their
holdings
by
conquest
and
were
almost
entirely
independent
of
the
central
authority
for
more
than
a
century
this
independence
had
been
growing
and
at
the
time
of
nobunaga
there
was
little
pretence
of
deferring
to
the
shōgun
in
any
matter
growing
out
of
the
relations
of
one
prince
to
the
other
and
none
at
all
in
reference
to
the
internal
government
of
the
territories
within
their
jurisdiction
the
principal
local
rulers
at
this
time
were
the
following
imagaya
yoshimoto
controlled
the
three
provinces
of
suruga
tōtōmi
and
mikawa
hōjō
ujiyasu
from
the
town
of
odowara
ruled
the
kwanto
including
the
provinces
of
sagami
musashi
awa
kazusa
shimosa
hitachi
kōtsuke
and
shimotsuke
takeda
shingen
ruled
the
province
of
kai
and
the
greater
part
of
the
mountainous
province
of
shinano
uesugi
kenshin
held
under
his
control
the
northwestern
provinces
of
echizen
echigo
etchū
and
noto
mōri
motonari
after
a
severe
contest
had
obtained
control
of
almost
all
the
sixteen
provinces
which
composed
the
chūgoku
or
central
country
the
island
of
kyūshū
had
been
the
scene
of
frequent
civil
wars
and
was
now
divided
between
the
houses
of
shimazu
of
satsuma
ōtomo
of
bungo
and
ryōzoji
of
hizen
and
finally
the
island
of
shikoku
was
under
the
control
of
chōsokabe
motochika
besides
these
principal
rulers
there
were
many
smaller
holders
who
occupied
fiefs
subordinate
to
the
great
lords
and
paid
for
their
protection
and
their
suzerainty
in
tribute
and
military
service
in
the
letters
of
the
jesuit
missionaries
of
this
period
the
great
lords
are
denominated
but
neither
according
to
the
theory
of
the
japanese
government
nor
the
actual
condition
of
these
rulers
can
the
name
be
considered
appropriate
the
term
daimyō
came
into
its
full
and
modern
use
only
when
ieyasu
reorganized
and
consolidated
the
feudal
system
of
the
empire
but
even
at
the
period
of
nobunaga
the
name
was
employed
to
indicate
the
owners
of
land
we
prefer
to
continue
down
to
the
time
of
the
tokugawa
shōguns
the
use
of
the
terms
and
for
the
rulers
and
their
territories
the
holdings
which
ota
nobunaga
inherited
from
his
father
consisted
only
of
four
small
properties
in
the
province
of
owari
acting
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
times
he
gradually
extended
his
authority
until
by
we
find
him
supreme
in
owari
with
his
chief
castle
at
kiyosu
near
to
the
city
of
nagoya
his
leading
retainers
and
generals
were
shibata
genroku
and
sakuma
yemon
to
whom
must
be
added
hideyoshi
who
gradually
and
rapidly
rose
from
obscurity
to
be
the
main
reliance
of
his
prince
nobunaga
was
a
skilful
general
and
whenever
an
interval
occurred
in
his
expeditions
against
his
hostile
neighbors
he
employed
the
time
in
carefully
drilling
his
troops
and
preparing
them
for
their
next
movements
he
found
in
hideyoshi
an
incomparable
strategist
whose
plans
artifices
and
intrigues
were
original
and
effective
and
were
worth
more
to
his
master
than
thousands
of
troops
it
was
not
difficult
in
those
days
to
find
excuses
to
invade
neighboring
domains
and
hence
we
find
nobunaga
as
soon
as
he
had
made
himself
master
of
owari
on
one
pretext
or
another
making
himself
also
master
of
the
provinces
of
mino
ōmi
and
isé
before
this
was
accomplished
however
we
see
plain
indications
both
on
the
part
of
nobunaga
and
his
retainers
that
the
ultimate
aim
in
view
was
the
subjugation
of
the
whole
country
and
the
establishment
of
a
government
like
that
of
yoritomo
at
this
time
the
affairs
of
the
ashikaga
shōguns
who
ruled
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
were
in
a
state
of
great
confusion
yoshiteru
the
shōgun
had
been
assassinated
by
one
of
his
retainers
miyoshi
yoshitsugu
the
younger
brother
of
yoshiteru
was
yoshiaki
who
desired
to
succeed
but
this
did
not
comport
with
the
designs
of
the
assassins
accordingly
after
making
several
unsuccessful
applications
for
military
aid
he
finally
applied
to
nobunaga
this
was
exactly
the
kind
of
alliance
that
nobunaga
wanted
to
justify
his
schemes
of
national
conquest
with
his
own
candidate
in
the
office
of
shōgun
he
could
proceed
without
impediment
to
reduce
all
the
princes
of
the
empire
to
his
supreme
authority
he
therefore
undertook
to
see
yoshiaki
established
as
shōgun
and
for
this
purpose
marched
a
large
army
into
kyōto
yoshiaki
was
installed
as
shōgun
in
and
at
his
suggestion
the
emperor
conferred
on
nobunaga
the
title
of
or
this
was
nobunaga
s
first
dealings
with
the
imperial
capital
and
the
presence
of
his
large
army
created
a
panic
among
the
inactive
and
peaceful
citizens
he
appointed
hideyoshi
as
of
the
army
at
the
capital
who
with
a
sagacity
and
energy
that
belonged
to
his
character
set
himself
to
inspire
confidence
and
to
overcome
the
prejudice
which
everywhere
prevailed
against
the
new
order
of
things
kyōto
had
suffered
so
much
from
fires
and
warlike
attacks
and
still
more
by
poverty
and
neglect
that
it
was
now
in
a
lamentable
condition
to
have
somebody
therefore
with
the
power
and
spirit
to
accomplish
his
ends
undertake
to
repair
some
of
the
wastes
and
put
in
order
what
had
long
run
to
ruin
was
an
unexpected
and
agreeable
surprise
the
palaces
of
the
emperor
and
the
shōgun
were
repaired
and
made
suitable
as
habitations
for
the
heads
of
the
nation
streets
and
bridges
temples
and
grounds
were
everywhere
put
in
order
kyōto
for
the
first
time
in
many
centuries
had
the
benefit
of
a
good
and
strong
government
it
was
the
custom
to
celebrate
the
establishment
of
a
new
with
popular
rejoicings
the
period
called
genki
was
begun
in
december
by
the
emperor
ōgimachi
nobunaga
brought
to
kyōto
on
this
occasion
a
very
large
army
in
order
to
impress
on
the
minds
of
the
nation
his
overwhelming
military
power
he
intended
moreover
to
march
his
forces
as
soon
as
this
celebration
was
over
against
prince
asakura
yoshikage
of
the
province
of
echizen
who
had
not
yet
submitted
himself
to
nobunaga
s
authority
and
who
had
not
given
in
his
adhesion
to
the
new
shōgun
taking
with
him
hideyoshi
and
all
the
troops
that
could
be
spared
from
kyōto
nobunaga
marched
north
into
the
domains
of
yoshikage
he
was
aided
in
his
resistance
by
asai
nagamasa
the
governor
of
the
castle
of
itami
in
the
province
of
ōmi
an
attempt
had
been
made
by
nobunaga
to
conciliate
nagamasa
by
giving
him
his
sister
in
marriage
but
nagamasa
was
still
cool
and
now
at
this
critical
time
he
turned
to
help
nobunaga
s
enemy
the
unexpected
combination
came
very
near
causing
nobunaga
a
disastrous
defeat
at
an
important
battle
which
was
fought
in
this
short
campaign
we
see
together
the
three
most
noted
men
of
their
time
nobunaga
hideyoshi
and
ieyasu
the
last
of
the
three
was
only
a
few
years
younger
than
hideyoshi
and
had
already
shown
indications
of
the
clear
and
steady
character
of
which
he
afterward
gave
such
indubitable
proof
the
result
was
the
defeat
of
nobunaga
s
enemies
and
his
victorious
return
to
the
castle
of
gifu
in
the
province
of
mino
but
his
way
was
not
yet
quite
free
from
obstacles
asakura
yoshikage
and
asai
nagamasa
although
defeated
were
not
crushed
and
made
various
efforts
to
regain
the
advantage
over
nobunaga
the
most
noted
of
these
was
when
nobunaga
was
absent
from
kyōto
with
troops
quelling
a
disturbance
in
ōsaka
asakura
and
asai
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
marched
a
strong
force
upon
the
city
they
had
proceeded
as
far
as
on
the
borders
of
lake
biwa
this
mountain
was
then
occupied
by
an
immense
buddhist
monastery
called
from
the
when
it
was
established
it
was
said
that
at
this
time
there
were
as
many
as
three
thousand
buildings
belonging
to
the
monastery
the
monks
of
this
establishment
were
exceedingly
independent
and
were
so
numerous
and
powerful
that
they
were
able
to
exact
whatever
concessions
they
desired
from
the
government
at
kyōto
from
which
they
were
only
a
few
miles
distant
they
disliked
nobunaga
and
his
powerful
government
with
which
they
dared
not
take
their
usual
liberties
accordingly
they
made
common
cause
with
asakura
and
asai
and
furnished
them
with
shelter
and
supplies
on
their
march
to
kyōto
but
nobunaga
met
them
before
they
reached
kyōto
and
so
hemmed
them
in
that
they
were
glad
to
sue
for
peace
and
get
back
to
their
own
provinces
as
well
as
they
could
but
on
the
monastery
nobunaga
in
visited
a
terrible
revenge
he
burned
their
buildings
and
what
monks
survived
the
slaughter
he
drove
into
banishment
the
monastery
was
partially
restored
subsequently
by
ieyasu
but
it
was
restricted
to
one
hundred
and
buildings
and
never
afterwards
was
a
political
power
in
the
country
during
these
years
of
nobunaga
s
supremacy
the
jesuit
fathers
had
been
pushing
forward
their
work
of
proselyting
and
had
met
with
marvellous
success
the
action
of
the
buddhist
priests
in
siding
with
his
enemies
and
the
consequent
aversion
with
which
he
regarded
them
led
nobunaga
to
favor
the
establishment
of
christian
churches
in
the
letters
of
the
fathers
at
this
period
frequent
references
are
made
to
nobunaga
and
of
his
favorable
attitude
toward
christianity
and
their
hope
that
he
would
finally
become
a
convert
but
it
is
plain
that
the
fathers
did
not
comprehend
fully
the
cause
for
the
enmity
of
nobunaga
to
the
buddhist
monks
and
his
political
reasons
for
showing
favor
to
the
christian
fathers
he
remained
as
long
as
he
lived
friendly
to
the
christian
church
but
made
no
progress
towards
an
avowal
of
his
faith
under
his
patronage
a
church
was
built
in
kyōto
and
another
at
azuchi
on
lake
biwa
where
he
built
for
himself
a
beautiful
castle
and
residence
by
this
patronage
and
the
zeal
of
the
fathers
the
christian
church
rose
to
its
greatest
prosperity
during
the
closing
years
of
nobunaga
s
life
in
the
year
a
mission
was
sent
to
the
pope
consisting
of
representatives
from
the
christian
princes
of
bungo
arima
and
ōmura
this
mission
consisted
of
two
young
christian
princes
about
sixteen
years
of
age
accompanied
by
two
counsellors
who
were
of
more
mature
years
and
by
father
valignani
a
portuguese
jesuit
and
by
father
diego
de
mesquita
as
their
preceptor
and
interpreter
they
visited
the
capitals
of
portugal
and
spain
which
at
this
time
were
combined
under
the
crown
of
philip
ii
of
spain
and
were
received
at
both
with
the
most
impressive
magnificence
they
afterward
visited
rome
and
were
met
by
the
of
the
pope
and
escorted
into
the
city
by
a
long
cavalcade
of
roman
nobles
they
were
lodged
in
the
house
of
the
jesuits
whence
they
were
conducted
by
an
immense
procession
to
the
vatican
the
japanese
ambassadors
rode
in
this
procession
on
horseback
dressed
in
their
richest
native
costume
they
each
presented
to
the
pope
the
letter
which
they
had
brought
from
their
prince
to
which
the
reply
of
the
pope
was
read
the
presents
which
they
had
brought
were
also
delivered
and
after
a
series
of
most
magnificent
entertainments
and
after
they
had
been
decorated
as
knights
of
the
gilded
spears
they
took
their
departure
in
the
meantime
pope
gregory
who
had
received
them
a
few
days
later
suddenly
died
his
successor
was
pope
sixtus
who
was
equally
attentive
to
the
ambassadors
and
who
dismissed
them
with
briefs
addressed
to
their
several
princes
shōgun
ashikaga
yoshiaki
whom
nobunaga
had
been
instrumental
in
installing
became
restive
in
the
subordinate
part
which
he
was
permitted
to
play
he
sought
out
the
princes
who
still
resisted
nobunaga
s
supremacy
and
communicated
with
them
in
reference
to
combining
against
him
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
fortify
some
of
the
castles
near
kyōto
nobunaga
took
strenuous
measures
against
yoshiaki
and
in
deposed
him
he
was
the
last
of
the
ashikaga
shōguns
and
with
him
came
to
an
end
a
dynasty
which
had
continued
from
in
for
two
hundred
and
years
nobunaga
assumed
the
duties
which
had
hitherto
been
performed
by
the
shōgun
that
is
he
issued
orders
and
made
war
and
formed
alliances
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
but
he
never
took
the
name
of
shōgun
or
presumed
to
act
in
a
capacity
which
from
the
time
of
yoritomo
had
always
been
filled
by
a
member
of
the
minamoto
family
while
he
was
a
member
of
the
taira
family
whether
this
was
the
cause
of
his
unwillingness
to
call
himself
by
this
title
to
which
he
might
legitimately
have
aspired
we
can
only
conjecture
of
one
thing
we
may
be
sure
that
he
was
disinclined
to
arouse
the
enmity
of
the
ambitious
princes
of
the
empire
whose
he
still
needed
to
establish
his
power
on
an
enduring
basis
by
assuming
a
position
which
centuries
of
usage
had
appropriated
to
another
family
the
emperor
bestowed
upon
him
the
title
of
which
at
this
time
however
was
a
purely
honorary
designation
and
carried
no
power
with
it
the
prince
of
chōsū
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
those
who
had
not
yet
submitted
to
the
supremacy
of
nobunaga
the
present
prince
was
mōri
terumoto
the
grandson
of
the
mōri
motonari
who
by
conquest
had
made
himself
master
of
a
large
part
of
the
central
provinces
nobunaga
despatched
hideyoshi
with
the
best
equipped
army
that
at
that
time
had
ever
been
fitted
out
in
japan
to
subdue
the
provinces
lying
to
the
west
of
kyōto
he
did
not
overrate
the
ability
of
the
general
to
whom
he
entrusted
this
task
they
set
out
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
their
first
movement
was
against
the
strongholds
of
the
province
of
harima
which
he
reduced
we
for
the
first
time
find
mention
in
this
campaign
of
kuroda
yoshitaka
who
in
the
invasion
of
korea
was
a
notable
figure
his
services
to
hideyoshi
at
this
time
were
most
signal
the
campaign
lasted
about
five
years
and
added
five
provinces
to
nobunaga
s
dominions
then
after
a
visit
to
kyōto
he
continued
his
conquests
never
meeting
with
a
defeat
the
most
remarkable
achievement
was
the
capture
of
the
castle
of
takamatsu
in
the
province
of
sanuki
this
castle
was
built
with
one
side
protected
by
the
and
two
lakes
lying
on
the
other
sides
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
approach
it
by
land
with
a
large
force
hideyoshi
with
the
genius
for
strategy
which
marked
his
character
saw
that
the
only
way
to
capture
the
fort
was
to
drown
it
out
with
water
he
then
set
his
troops
to
dam
up
the
river
below
the
fortress
gradually
this
was
accomplished
and
as
the
water
rose
the
occupants
of
the
castle
became
more
uncomfortable
hideyoshi
understanding
his
master
s
character
feared
to
accomplish
this
important
and
critical
exploit
without
nobunaga
s
knowledge
he
therefore
wrote
asking
him
to
come
without
delay
to
his
assistance
nobunaga
set
out
with
a
group
of
generals
among
whom
was
akechi
mitsuhide
with
the
troops
under
their
command
they
started
from
azuchi
on
lake
biwa
which
was
occupied
as
nobunaga
s
headquarters
they
were
to
proceed
to
the
besieged
fort
by
the
shortest
route
nobunaga
with
a
small
escort
went
by
way
of
kyōto
expecting
soon
to
follow
them
he
took
up
his
temporary
abode
in
the
temple
of
honnōji
it
was
observed
that
akechi
with
his
troops
took
a
different
route
from
the
others
and
marched
towards
kyōto
when
spoken
to
about
his
purpose
he
exclaimed
my
enemy
is
in
the
he
explained
to
his
captains
his
purpose
and
promised
them
unlimited
plunder
if
they
assisted
him
he
led
his
troops
to
kyōto
and
directly
to
the
honnōji
nobunaga
hearing
the
noise
looked
out
and
at
once
saw
who
were
the
traitors
he
defended
himself
for
a
time
but
soon
saw
that
he
was
hopelessly
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
help
he
retired
to
an
inner
room
of
the
temple
set
it
on
fire
and
then
calmly
committed
his
body
was
buried
in
the
burning
and
falling
ruins
his
death
occurred
in
thus
ended
the
career
of
one
of
japan
s
great
men
he
had
shown
the
possibility
of
uniting
the
provinces
of
japan
under
one
strong
government
he
had
given
to
kyōto
and
the
provinces
lying
east
and
north
of
it
a
period
of
peace
and
quiet
under
which
great
progress
had
been
made
in
agriculture
the
arts
and
in
literature
he
was
a
warrior
and
not
a
statesman
and
for
this
reason
less
was
done
than
might
have
been
in
confirming
and
solidifying
the
reforms
which
his
conquest
had
made
possible
personally
he
was
and
overbearing
and
often
gave
offence
to
those
who
were
not
able
to
see
through
his
rough
exterior
to
the
true
and
generous
heart
which
lay
beneath
the
cause
of
the
plot
against
him
was
probably
the
consequence
of
a
familiarity
with
which
he
sometimes
treated
his
military
subordinates
it
is
said
that
on
one
occasion
in
his
palace
when
he
had
grown
somewhat
he
took
the
head
of
his
general
akechi
under
his
arm
and
with
his
fan
played
a
tune
upon
it
using
it
like
a
drum
akechi
was
mortally
offended
and
never
forgave
the
humiliating
joke
his
treason
which
resulted
in
nobunaga
s
death
was
the
final
outcome
of
this
bit
of
thoughtless
chapter
ix
toyotomi
hideyoshi
the
death
of
nobunaga
in
the
year
of
his
age
left
the
country
in
a
critical
condition
sakuma
and
shibata
had
been
his
active
retainers
and
generals
for
many
years
and
they
had
the
most
bitter
and
envious
hatred
toward
hideyoshi
whom
they
had
seen
advance
steadily
up
to
and
past
them
in
the
march
of
military
preferment
it
was
to
hideyoshi
that
the
country
looked
to
take
up
the
work
which
nobunaga
s
death
had
interrupted
akechi
began
to
realize
when
too
late
that
he
must
reckon
with
him
for
his
terrible
crime
he
appointed
two
of
his
lieutenants
to
assassinate
hideyoshi
on
his
way
back
to
the
capital
he
sent
word
to
mōri
terumoto
who
was
trying
to
raise
the
siege
of
the
castle
of
takamatsu
concerning
nobunaga
s
death
hoping
that
this
tragedy
would
encourage
terumoto
to
complete
his
designs
in
the
meantime
the
news
had
reached
hideyoshi
terumoto
had
heard
of
the
starting
of
nobunaga
with
additional
troops
and
had
determined
to
make
peace
with
hideyoshi
he
had
sent
messengers
with
a
proposition
for
peace
the
measures
for
taking
the
castle
had
succeeded
and
it
was
surrendered
in
this
state
of
things
hideyoshi
pursued
a
course
which
was
characteristic
of
him
he
sent
word
to
terumoto
that
nobunaga
was
now
dead
and
that
therefore
his
proposition
for
peace
might
if
he
wished
be
withdrawn
you
must
decide
he
said
whether
you
will
make
peace
or
not
it
is
immaterial
whether
i
fight
or
conclude
a
treaty
of
peace
to
such
a
message
there
could
be
only
one
answer
peace
was
at
once
concluded
and
hideyoshi
started
for
kyōto
to
deal
with
the
traitors
the
attempt
to
assassinate
hideyoshi
on
his
journey
came
very
near
being
successful
he
was
in
such
eagerness
to
reach
his
destination
that
he
hurried
on
without
regard
to
his
army
which
accompanied
him
a
small
kept
up
as
well
as
they
could
with
their
impatient
chief
at
nishinomiya
in
this
journey
hideyoshi
when
in
advance
of
his
was
attacked
by
a
band
of
the
assassins
his
only
way
of
escape
was
by
a
narrow
road
between
rice
fields
leading
to
a
small
temple
when
he
had
traversed
part
of
this
lane
he
dismounted
turning
his
horse
around
along
the
way
he
had
come
and
stabbed
him
in
the
hind
leg
mad
with
pain
he
galloped
back
with
disastrous
effect
upon
the
band
which
was
following
him
meanwhile
hideyoshi
hurried
to
the
temple
here
the
priests
were
all
in
a
big
common
taking
their
bath
hastily
telling
them
who
he
was
and
begging
their
protection
he
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
plunged
in
among
the
naked
priests
when
the
assassins
arrived
they
could
find
nothing
but
a
full
of
priests
whom
they
soon
left
in
search
of
the
fugitive
as
they
disappeared
the
anxious
arrived
and
were
astonished
and
amused
to
find
their
chief
clad
in
the
garb
of
a
priest
and
refreshed
after
his
hurried
journey
with
a
luxurious
bath
hideyoshi
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
kyōto
issued
an
invitation
to
all
the
princes
to
join
him
in
punishing
those
who
had
brought
about
the
death
of
nobunaga
a
battle
was
fought
at
yodo
not
far
from
kyōto
which
resulted
in
the
complete
defeat
of
akechi
he
escaped
however
from
this
battle
but
on
his
way
to
his
own
castle
he
was
recognized
by
a
peasant
and
wounded
with
a
bamboo
spear
seeing
now
that
all
hope
was
gone
he
committed
and
thus
ended
his
inglorious
career
his
head
was
exposed
in
front
of
honnōji
the
temple
where
nobunaga
perished
as
might
have
been
expected
this
premature
death
of
he
was
only
years
an
intense
excitement
the
idea
of
heredity
had
so
fixed
a
place
in
men
s
minds
that
the
only
thought
of
nobunaga
s
friends
and
retainers
was
to
put
forward
in
his
place
some
one
who
should
be
his
heir
there
were
living
two
sons
both
by
concubines
viz
nobuo
and
nobutaka
and
a
grandson
sambōshi
still
a
child
who
was
a
son
of
his
son
nobutada
now
deceased
each
of
these
representatives
had
supporters
among
the
powerful
retainers
of
the
dead
prince
it
may
be
assumed
that
each
was
supported
not
because
of
the
rightful
claim
which
he
had
to
the
estates
and
the
power
which
the
dead
prince
had
left
behind
him
but
solely
because
the
supporters
of
the
successful
heir
would
be
entrusted
with
special
authority
and
endowed
with
conquered
provinces
it
is
sufficient
to
explain
here
that
hideyoshi
supported
the
candidacy
of
the
grandson
sambōshi
probably
with
no
higher
motive
nor
more
disinterested
purpose
than
the
others
after
a
noisy
and
hot
debate
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
grandson
should
be
installed
as
successor
and
hideyoshi
undertook
to
be
his
guardian
he
had
a
large
army
at
kyōto
and
with
this
he
felt
strong
enough
to
carry
things
with
a
high
hand
he
appointed
a
funeral
ceremony
to
be
held
in
honor
of
nobunaga
to
which
all
the
princes
were
invited
and
he
posted
his
troops
in
such
a
way
as
to
command
every
avenue
of
approach
he
claimed
for
himself
as
guardian
of
the
child
sambōshi
precedence
of
all
the
princes
and
generals
so
at
the
funeral
service
with
the
child
sambōshi
in
his
arms
he
proceeded
in
advance
of
all
others
to
pay
memorial
honors
to
the
dead
he
supported
this
action
with
such
an
overwhelming
display
of
military
force
that
his
enemies
were
afraid
to
show
any
resistance
the
disappointed
princes
retired
to
their
provinces
and
hoped
that
by
some
fortuitous
circumstances
they
might
still
be
able
to
circumvent
the
plans
of
hideyoshi
he
saw
well
that
he
must
meet
the
opposition
which
would
be
concentrated
on
him
by
activity
and
force
as
a
general
not
one
of
his
enemies
could
compare
with
him
in
fertility
of
resources
in
decisiveness
of
action
and
in
command
of
military
strength
his
first
contest
was
with
his
old
comrade
in
arms
shibata
katsuie
who
had
served
with
him
under
nobunaga
and
who
was
intensely
jealous
of
hideyoshi
s
rapid
rise
in
military
rank
and
territorial
authority
shibata
had
championed
the
cause
of
nobutaka
in
the
contest
as
to
the
successor
of
nobunaga
he
had
command
of
troops
in
echizen
and
nobutaka
was
governor
of
the
castle
of
gifu
in
the
province
of
mino
the
campaign
was
a
short
and
decisive
one
the
battle
was
fought
at
shigutake
and
resulted
in
the
complete
defeat
of
shibata
and
his
allies
it
is
notable
that
in
this
battle
artillery
were
used
and
played
a
conspicuous
part
shibata
after
his
overthrow
committed
nobutaka
having
escaped
also
put
an
end
to
himself
thus
the
active
enemies
of
hideyoshi
in
the
north
and
west
were
overcome
and
the
forfeited
territory
made
use
of
to
reward
his
friends
his
next
contest
was
with
the
adherents
of
nobuo
the
other
son
of
nobunaga
this
was
made
memorable
by
the
assistance
which
ieyasu
rendered
to
nobuo
hideyoshi
s
army
himself
not
being
present
was
defeated
ieyasu
being
satisfied
with
this
victory
and
knowing
that
he
could
not
ultimately
triumph
now
made
peace
with
hideyoshi
the
island
of
shikoku
which
was
under
the
control
of
chōsokabe
motochika
was
reduced
to
subjection
in
a
brief
campaign
and
the
chiefs
compelled
to
do
duty
to
hideyoshi
as
their
head
it
seems
that
at
this
time
hideyoshi
was
ambitious
to
attain
official
appointment
which
would
legitimately
descend
to
his
children
and
make
him
the
founder
of
a
new
line
of
shōguns
he
applied
to
the
yoshiaki
whom
nobunaga
had
deposed
and
who
was
now
living
in
retirement
intimating
that
it
would
be
to
his
interest
to
adopt
him
as
his
son
so
that
he
could
be
appointed
by
the
emperor
as
shōgun
but
yoshiaki
declined
to
comply
with
this
suggestion
on
account
of
hideyoshi
s
humble
origin
in
place
of
this
appointment
however
he
was
installed
by
the
emperor
ōgimachi
as
which
is
higher
in
rank
than
any
other
office
in
the
gift
of
the
imperial
court
hitherto
this
title
had
been
borne
exclusively
by
members
of
the
fujiwara
family
and
it
must
have
been
a
severe
blow
to
their
aristocratic
pride
to
have
a
humble
plebeian
who
had
risen
solely
by
his
own
talents
thus
elevated
by
imperial
appointment
to
this
dignified
position
he
also
received
at
this
time
the
name
of
toyotomi
by
which
he
was
afterward
called
and
in
recognition
of
his
successful
conquest
of
much
territory
he
received
the
honorary
title
of
there
were
a
few
years
from
about
an
important
exception
which
will
be
given
peace
reigned
in
all
the
territories
of
japan
and
when
hideyoshi
devoted
himself
wisely
and
patiently
to
the
settlement
of
the
feudal
condition
of
the
country
it
was
at
this
time
he
began
building
his
great
castle
at
ōsaka
which
occupied
about
two
years
workmen
were
drawn
from
almost
all
parts
of
japan
and
a
portion
of
it
is
said
to
have
been
finer
and
more
massive
than
had
ever
been
seen
in
japan
this
magnificent
work
survived
its
capture
by
ieyasu
in
and
remained
undisturbed
down
to
the
wars
of
the
restoration
in
when
it
was
burned
by
the
tokugawa
troops
at
the
time
they
were
about
to
evacuate
it
the
exception
to
which
reference
is
made
above
was
the
important
campaign
which
hideyoshi
was
called
upon
to
conduct
in
the
island
of
kyūshū
against
the
satsuma
clan
the
distance
at
which
kyūshū
lay
from
the
centre
of
imperial
operations
the
mountainous
and
inaccessible
character
of
a
great
part
of
the
territory
made
it
no
easy
matter
to
deal
with
the
refractory
inhabitants
of
this
island
the
satsuma
clan
even
at
that
early
day
had
a
reputation
for
bravery
and
dash
which
made
them
feared
by
all
their
neighbors
the
prince
of
satsuma
at
this
time
was
shimazu
yoshihisa
a
member
of
the
same
family
who
held
the
daimiate
until
the
abolition
of
the
feudal
system
it
is
a
tradition
that
the
first
of
this
family
was
a
son
of
yoritomo
who
in
the
year
was
appointed
governor
of
satsuma
like
all
the
feudal
princes
of
the
period
the
prince
of
satsuma
was
ambitious
to
extend
his
dominion
as
far
as
possible
hyūga
bungo
higo
and
hizen
were
either
wholly
or
in
part
subject
to
his
authority
so
that
by
the
year
it
was
the
boast
of
the
prince
that
eight
provinces
acknowledged
him
as
lord
it
was
in
this
critical
period
that
hideyoshi
was
appealed
to
for
help
by
the
threatened
provinces
he
first
sent
a
special
envoy
to
kagoshima
who
was
directed
to
summon
the
prince
to
kyōto
to
submit
himself
to
the
emperor
and
seek
investiture
from
him
for
the
territories
which
he
held
shimazu
received
this
message
with
scorn
tore
up
the
letter
and
trampled
it
under
his
feet
and
declared
that
to
a
man
of
mean
extraction
like
hideyoshi
he
would
never
yield
allegiance
both
parties
recognized
the
necessity
of
deciding
this
question
by
the
arbitrament
of
war
hideyoshi
called
upon
provinces
to
furnish
troops
for
this
expedition
it
is
said
that
men
were
assembled
at
ōsaka
ready
to
be
transported
into
kyūshū
the
vanguard
consisting
of
men
under
hidenaga
the
brother
of
hideyoshi
set
sail
january
troops
from
the
western
provinces
joined
these
so
that
this
advanced
army
numbered
not
less
than
men
in
due
time
january
hideyoshi
himself
with
his
main
army
consisting
of
men
left
ōsaka
marching
by
land
to
shimonoseki
and
from
this
point
crossing
over
to
kyūshū
the
satsuma
armies
were
in
all
cases
far
outnumbered
and
step
by
step
were
compelled
to
retreat
upon
kagoshima
hideyoshi
had
by
means
of
spies
acquired
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
difficult
country
through
which
his
armies
must
march
before
reaching
kagoshima
after
much
fighting
the
satsuma
troops
were
at
last
driven
into
the
castle
of
kagoshima
and
it
only
remained
for
hideyoshi
to
capture
this
stronghold
in
order
to
end
in
the
most
brilliant
manner
his
undertaking
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
hideyoshi
made
one
of
these
surprising
and
clever
movements
which
stamp
him
as
a
man
of
consummate
genius
instead
of
capturing
the
fortress
and
dividing
up
the
territory
among
his
deserving
generals
as
was
expected
he
restored
to
the
shimazu
family
its
original
buildings
the
provinces
of
satsuma
and
ōsumi
and
half
the
province
of
hyūga
only
imposing
as
a
condition
that
the
present
reigning
prince
should
retire
in
favor
of
his
son
and
that
he
should
hold
his
fief
as
a
grant
from
the
emperor
thus
ended
one
of
the
most
memorable
of
the
campaigns
which
hideyoshi
had
up
to
this
time
undertaken
and
with
this
also
closed
a
series
of
events
which
exerted
a
permanent
influence
on
the
history
of
japan
it
will
be
desirable
at
this
point
to
trace
the
incidents
which
had
transpired
in
connection
with
the
jesuit
fathers
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
work
of
the
fathers
was
much
interfered
with
by
the
political
troubles
which
preceded
the
advent
of
nobunaga
owing
to
their
taking
sides
with
his
enemies
he
was
very
much
incensed
against
the
buddhist
priests
and
visited
his
indignation
upon
them
in
a
drastic
measure
his
desire
to
humiliate
the
buddhist
priests
probably
led
him
to
assume
a
favorable
attitude
towards
the
christian
fathers
as
long
therefore
as
nobunaga
lived
churches
were
protected
and
the
work
of
proselyting
went
on
even
after
the
death
of
nobunaga
in
nothing
occurred
for
some
time
to
interfere
with
the
spread
of
christianity
hideyoshi
was
too
much
occupied
with
political
and
military
affairs
to
give
much
attention
to
the
circumstances
concerning
religion
indeed
the
opinion
of
dening
in
his
of
is
no
doubt
true
that
he
was
in
no
respect
of
a
religious
temperament
even
the
superstitions
of
his
own
country
were
treated
with
scant
courtesy
by
this
great
master
of
men
gregory
xiii
seeing
what
progress
the
jesuits
were
making
and
realizing
how
fatal
to
success
any
conflict
between
rival
brotherhoods
would
be
issued
a
brief
in
that
no
religious
teachers
except
jesuits
should
be
allowed
in
japan
this
regulation
was
exceedingly
distasteful
to
both
the
dominicans
and
the
franciscans
especially
after
the
visit
of
the
japanese
embassy
to
lisbon
madrid
and
rome
had
directed
the
attention
of
the
whole
religious
world
to
the
triumphs
which
the
jesuits
were
making
in
japan
envy
against
the
portuguese
merchants
for
their
monopoly
of
the
japanese
trade
had
also
its
place
in
stirring
up
the
spaniards
at
manila
to
seek
an
entrance
to
the
island
empire
the
opposition
with
which
christianity
had
met
was
represented
as
due
to
the
character
and
behavior
of
the
missioners
in
view
of
these
circumstances
the
spanish
governor
of
manila
sent
a
letter
to
hideyoshi
asking
for
permission
to
open
trade
with
some
of
the
ports
of
japan
four
franciscans
attached
themselves
to
the
bearer
of
this
letter
and
in
this
way
were
introduced
into
the
interior
of
japan
among
the
valuable
presents
sent
to
hideyoshi
by
the
governor
of
manila
was
a
fine
spanish
horse
with
all
its
equipments
these
franciscans
who
came
in
this
indirect
way
were
permitted
to
establish
themselves
in
kyōto
and
nagasaki
they
were
at
once
met
by
the
protest
of
the
jesuits
who
urged
that
the
brief
of
the
pope
excluded
them
but
these
wily
franciscans
replied
that
they
had
entered
japan
as
ambassadors
and
not
as
religious
fathers
and
that
now
when
they
were
in
japan
the
brief
of
the
pope
did
not
require
them
to
leave
a
very
bitter
state
of
feeling
from
the
first
therefore
manifested
itself
between
the
jesuits
and
franciscans
the
latter
claimed
that
the
opposition
they
met
with
was
due
to
the
plots
and
intrigues
of
the
jesuits
and
they
openly
avowed
that
the
jesuit
fathers
through
cowardice
failed
to
exert
themselves
in
the
fulfilment
of
their
religious
duties
and
in
a
craven
spirit
submitted
to
restrictions
on
their
liberty
to
preach
hideyoshi
s
suspicion
was
aroused
against
the
foreigners
about
this
time
by
the
gossip
of
a
portuguese
which
had
been
reported
to
him
this
report
represented
the
captain
as
saying
the
king
my
master
begins
by
sending
priests
who
win
over
the
people
and
when
this
is
done
he
despatches
his
troops
to
join
the
native
christians
and
the
conquest
is
easy
and
this
plan
seemed
so
exactly
to
agree
with
experiences
in
china
india
and
the
east
indies
that
hideyoshi
resolved
to
make
it
impossible
in
japan
he
therefore
issued
an
edict
in
the
year
commanding
all
foreign
religious
teachers
on
pain
of
death
to
depart
from
japan
in
twenty
days
this
edict
however
gave
leave
to
portuguese
merchants
to
traffic
and
reside
in
our
ports
till
further
order
but
withal
we
do
hereby
strictly
forbid
them
on
pain
of
having
both
their
ships
and
merchandises
confiscated
to
bring
over
with
them
any
foreign
in
consequence
of
this
edict
in
six
franciscans
and
three
jesuits
were
arrested
in
ōsaka
and
kyōto
and
taken
to
nagasaki
and
there
burnt
this
was
the
first
case
of
the
execution
of
christians
by
the
order
of
the
government
to
explain
the
transportation
of
these
missionaries
to
nagasaki
and
their
execution
there
it
should
be
stated
that
in
at
the
close
of
the
satsuma
campaign
nagasaki
had
been
taken
from
the
prince
of
ōmura
and
made
a
government
city
to
be
controlled
by
a
governor
appointed
immediately
from
kyōto
shortly
after
this
in
on
account
of
its
superior
harbor
it
was
fixed
upon
as
the
only
port
at
which
foreign
vessels
would
be
admitted
there
was
still
one
refractory
element
in
his
dominions
which
it
was
necessary
to
deal
with
hōjō
ujimasa
maintained
a
hostile
attitude
at
odawara
he
was
determined
once
for
all
to
reduce
this
rebellious
chief
and
the
others
who
might
be
influenced
by
his
example
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
the
details
of
this
short
but
decisive
undertaking
only
one
incident
deserves
to
be
given
as
illustrative
of
the
character
of
hideyoshi
in
sending
troops
to
the
field
of
action
it
was
necessary
that
a
large
number
of
horses
should
cross
the
sea
of
enshū
which
was
usually
very
rough
at
that
time
of
year
the
boatmen
as
is
usual
were
very
superstitious
and
had
a
decided
aversion
to
transporting
the
horses
in
their
boats
averring
that
the
god
of
the
sea
ryūgū
had
a
special
dislike
for
horses
hideyoshi
sent
for
the
boatmen
and
told
them
that
he
had
undertaken
this
expedition
at
the
command
of
the
emperor
and
that
the
god
of
the
sea
was
too
polite
to
interfere
in
anything
pertaining
to
the
transportation
of
troops
for
such
a
purpose
he
said
however
that
he
would
make
it
all
right
by
writing
a
letter
to
ryūgū
instructing
him
to
insure
the
safe
passage
of
the
ships
this
was
done
and
a
letter
addressed
mr
ryūgū
was
thrown
into
the
sea
the
boatmen
were
satisfied
and
the
horses
were
taken
over
without
difficulty
with
the
fall
of
odawara
the
whole
of
the
kwantō
comprising
the
provinces
of
sagami
musashi
kōtsuke
shimotsuke
hitachi
shimōsa
kazusa
and
awa
came
into
the
possession
of
hideyoshi
during
the
progress
of
the
siege
it
is
said
that
he
and
ieyasu
were
standing
in
a
watch
tower
which
they
had
built
on
the
heights
above
the
castle
of
odawara
hideyoshi
pointed
to
the
great
plain
before
them
and
said
before
many
days
i
will
have
conquered
all
this
and
i
propose
to
give
it
into
your
ieyasu
thanked
him
warmly
and
said
that
were
indeed
great
hideyoshi
added
wilt
thou
reside
here
at
odawara
as
the
hōjō
have
done
up
to
this
time
ieyasu
answered
aye
my
lord
that
i
that
will
not
do
said
hideyoshi
i
see
on
the
map
that
there
is
a
place
called
yedo
about
twenty
eastward
from
us
it
is
a
position
far
better
than
this
and
that
will
be
the
place
for
thee
to
ieyasu
bowed
low
and
replied
i
will
with
reverence
obey
your
lordship
s
in
accordance
with
this
conversation
after
the
fall
of
odawara
ieyasu
was
endowed
with
the
provinces
of
the
kwantō
and
took
up
his
residence
at
yedo
this
is
the
first
important
appearance
of
yedo
in
the
general
history
of
japan
it
had
however
an
earlier
history
when
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
appears
as
a
fishing
village
called
that
is
of
the
near
this
fishing
village
ōta
dōkwan
a
feudal
baron
built
himself
in
a
castle
with
the
advent
of
ieyasu
yedo
became
a
place
of
first
importance
a
rank
which
it
still
holds
the
object
of
hideyoshi
in
thus
entrusting
this
great
heritage
to
ieyasu
seems
to
have
been
to
secure
him
by
the
chains
of
gratitude
to
himself
and
his
family
already
ieyasu
was
connected
by
marriage
with
hideyoshi
his
wife
being
hideyoshi
s
sister
by
making
him
lord
of
an
immense
and
powerful
country
he
hoped
to
secure
him
in
perpetual
loyalty
to
himself
and
his
heirs
in
order
that
he
might
be
free
from
the
cares
and
responsibilities
of
the
government
at
home
hideyoshi
retired
from
the
position
of
and
took
the
title
of
by
this
title
he
came
to
be
generally
known
in
japanese
history
taikō
sama
or
my
lord
taikō
being
the
form
by
which
he
was
commonly
spoken
of
his
nephew
and
heir
hidetsugu
was
at
this
time
promoted
to
the
title
of
and
was
ostensibly
at
the
head
of
the
government
the
jesuit
fathers
speak
of
him
as
mild
and
amiable
and
as
at
one
time
a
hopeful
student
of
the
christian
religion
they
note
however
a
strange
characteristic
in
him
that
he
was
fond
of
cruelty
and
that
when
criminals
were
to
be
put
to
death
he
sought
the
privilege
of
cutting
them
into
pieces
and
trying
cruel
experiments
upon
their
suffering
bodies
in
taikō
sama
had
by
one
of
his
wives
a
son
whom
he
named
hideyori
over
this
heir
whom
however
many
suspect
of
not
being
taikō
sama
s
son
he
made
great
rejoicing
throughout
the
empire
he
required
his
nephew
to
adopt
this
son
as
his
heir
although
he
had
several
sons
of
his
own
the
result
of
this
action
was
a
feeling
of
hostility
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
hidetsugu
applied
to
mōri
the
chief
of
chōsū
to
aid
him
in
the
conflict
with
his
uncle
but
mōri
was
too
wary
to
enter
upon
such
a
contest
with
the
veteran
general
instead
of
helping
hidetsugu
he
revealed
to
taikō
sama
the
traitorous
proposition
of
his
nephew
hidetsugu
was
thereupon
stripped
of
his
office
and
sent
as
an
exile
to
the
monastery
of
in
the
province
of
kii
a
year
later
he
was
commanded
with
his
attendants
to
commit
and
with
an
unusual
exhibition
of
cruelty
his
counsellors
wives
and
children
were
likewise
put
to
death
hideyoshi
had
for
a
long
time
contemplated
the
invasion
of
korea
and
ultimately
of
china
in
a
conversation
with
nobunaga
when
he
was
about
to
set
out
on
his
conquest
of
the
western
provinces
he
is
represented
as
saying
i
hope
to
bring
the
whole
of
chūgoku
into
subjection
to
us
when
that
is
accomplished
i
will
go
on
to
kyūshū
and
take
the
whole
of
it
when
kyūshū
is
ours
if
you
will
grant
me
the
revenue
of
that
island
for
one
year
i
will
prepare
ships
of
war
and
purchase
provisions
and
go
over
and
take
korea
korea
i
shall
ask
you
to
bestow
on
me
as
a
reward
for
my
services
and
to
enable
me
to
make
still
further
conquests
for
with
korean
troops
aided
by
your
illustrious
influence
i
intend
to
bring
the
whole
of
china
under
my
sway
when
that
is
effected
the
three
countries
china
korea
and
japan
will
be
one
i
shall
do
it
all
as
easily
as
a
man
rolls
up
a
piece
of
matting
and
carries
it
under
his
he
had
already
carried
out
part
of
this
plan
he
had
brought
the
whole
of
chūgoku
and
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
under
his
rule
it
remained
for
him
to
effect
the
conquest
of
korea
and
china
in
order
to
complete
his
ambitious
project
for
this
purpose
he
needed
ships
on
a
large
scale
for
the
transportation
of
troops
and
for
keeping
them
supplied
with
necessary
provisions
from
the
foreign
merchants
who
traded
at
his
ports
he
hoped
to
obtain
ships
larger
and
stronger
than
were
built
in
his
own
dominions
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
him
when
he
found
this
impossible
and
that
the
merchants
whom
he
had
favored
were
unwilling
to
put
their
ships
at
his
disposal
it
is
claimed
by
the
jesuit
fathers
that
this
disappointment
was
the
chief
reason
for
the
want
of
favor
with
which
hideyoshi
regarded
them
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
it
is
also
advanced
as
one
reason
for
his
entering
on
the
invasion
of
korea
that
he
might
thus
employ
in
distant
and
dangerous
expeditions
some
of
the
christian
princes
whose
fidelity
to
himself
and
loyalty
to
the
emperor
he
thought
he
had
reason
to
doubt
he
was
ambitious
so
they
said
to
rival
in
his
own
person
the
reputation
of
the
emperor
ōjin
who
rose
in
popular
estimation
to
the
rank
of
hachiman
the
god
of
war
and
who
is
worshipped
in
many
temples
because
while
he
was
still
unborn
his
mother
led
a
hostile
and
successful
expedition
into
this
same
korea
the
immediate
pretext
for
a
war
was
the
fact
that
for
many
years
the
embassies
which
it
had
been
the
custom
to
send
from
korea
to
japan
with
gifts
and
acknowledgments
had
been
discontinued
in
he
sent
an
envoy
to
remonstrate
who
was
unsuccessful
subsequently
he
sent
the
prince
of
tsushima
who
had
maintained
at
fusan
a
port
of
korea
a
station
for
trade
to
continue
negotiations
after
some
delay
and
the
concession
of
important
conditions
the
prince
had
the
satisfaction
in
of
accompanying
an
embassy
which
the
government
of
korea
sent
to
hideyoshi
they
arrived
at
kyōto
at
the
time
when
hideyoshi
was
absent
on
his
campaign
against
hōjō
ujimasa
at
odawara
he
allowed
them
to
await
his
return
and
even
when
he
had
resumed
his
residence
at
the
capital
he
showed
no
eagerness
to
give
them
an
audience
on
the
pretence
that
the
hall
of
audience
needed
repairs
he
kept
them
waiting
many
months
before
he
gave
orders
for
their
reception
it
seemed
that
he
was
trying
to
humiliate
them
in
revenge
for
their
dilatoriness
in
coming
to
him
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
conduct
an
expedition
in
any
event
into
korea
and
china
and
the
disrespect
with
which
he
treated
the
embassy
was
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
widening
the
breach
already
existing
aston
has
given
us
an
account
of
the
reception
which
was
finally
accorded
to
the
ambassadors
drawn
from
korean
sources
and
which
shows
that
they
were
entertained
in
a
very
unceremonious
fashion
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
in
japan
this
man
whom
they
had
been
led
to
look
upon
as
a
sovereign
was
only
a
subject
they
presented
a
letter
from
the
king
of
korea
conveying
his
congratulations
and
enumerating
the
gifts
he
had
sent
these
enumerated
gifts
consisted
of
horses
falcons
saddles
harness
cloth
of
various
kinds
skins
ginseng
etc
these
were
articles
which
the
japanese
of
an
earlier
age
had
prized
very
highly
and
for
the
more
artistic
production
of
some
of
which
the
koreans
had
rendered
material
assistance
hideyoshi
suggested
that
the
embassy
should
return
to
their
own
country
at
once
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
their
letter
this
they
were
unwilling
to
do
so
they
waited
at
sakai
whence
they
were
to
sail
till
the
was
pleased
to
send
them
a
message
for
their
king
it
was
so
arrogant
in
tone
that
they
had
to
beg
for
its
modification
several
times
before
they
dared
to
carry
it
home
the
letter
plainly
announced
his
intention
to
invade
china
and
called
upon
the
koreans
to
aid
him
in
this
purpose
the
ambassadors
went
home
with
the
conviction
that
it
was
hideyoshi
s
intention
to
invade
their
country
at
their
instigation
the
government
made
what
preparations
it
could
by
repairing
fortresses
and
collecting
troops
arms
and
provisions
the
country
was
a
poor
country
and
had
had
the
good
fortune
or
the
misfortune
to
remain
at
peace
for
two
hundred
years
the
arts
of
war
had
been
forgotten
they
had
no
generals
who
could
cope
with
the
practised
soldiers
of
japan
firearms
which
had
been
introduced
into
the
military
equipments
of
japanese
armies
were
almost
unknown
in
korea
it
is
true
that
they
had
been
taken
under
the
protection
of
china
and
could
call
upon
her
for
aid
but
china
was
distant
and
slow
and
korea
might
be
destroyed
before
her
slumbering
energies
could
be
aroused
the
preparations
which
hideyoshi
made
as
was
his
custom
were
thorough
and
extensive
each
prince
in
kyūshū
as
being
nearest
to
the
seat
of
war
was
required
to
furnish
a
quota
of
troops
in
proportion
to
his
revenues
each
prince
in
shikoku
and
in
the
main
island
in
like
manner
was
to
provide
troops
proportionate
to
his
revenue
and
his
proximity
to
the
seat
of
war
princes
whose
territories
bordered
on
the
sea
were
to
furnish
junks
and
boats
and
men
to
handle
them
the
force
which
was
thus
assembled
at
nagoya
now
called
karatsu
in
hizen
was
estimated
at
men
of
whom
were
to
be
immediately
despatched
hideyoshi
did
not
personally
lead
this
force
it
was
under
the
command
of
two
generals
who
were
independent
of
each
other
but
were
ordered
to
one
of
these
generals
was
konishi
yukinaga
whom
the
jesuit
fathers
refer
to
under
the
name
of
don
austin
from
an
humble
position
in
life
he
had
risen
to
high
and
responsible
rank
in
the
army
under
the
influence
of
takeyama
a
christian
prince
whom
the
jesuit
fathers
call
justo
ucondono
he
had
been
converted
to
christianity
hideyoshi
as
has
been
pointed
out
was
desirous
of
securing
the
help
of
the
christian
princes
in
kyūshū
and
therefore
appointed
a
christian
as
one
of
the
under
him
were
sent
the
contingents
from
bungo
ōmura
arima
and
other
provinces
where
the
christian
element
was
predominant
this
division
of
the
invading
army
may
therefore
be
looked
upon
as
representing
the
christian
population
of
the
empire
the
other
was
katō
kiyomasa
who
had
been
associated
with
hideyoshi
ever
since
the
times
of
nobunaga
he
was
the
son
of
a
blacksmith
and
in
he
became
one
of
hideyoshi
s
retainers
he
was
a
man
of
unusual
size
and
of
great
personal
bravery
he
commanded
an
army
collected
mainly
from
the
northern
and
eastern
provinces
which
comprised
the
experienced
veterans
of
hideyoshi
s
earlier
campaigns
he
is
usually
spoken
of
as
inimical
to
the
christians
but
this
enmity
probably
grew
up
along
with
the
between
the
two
armies
in
korea
konishi
s
division
arrived
in
korea
april
and
captured
the
small
town
of
fusan
which
had
been
the
port
at
which
the
japanese
had
for
generations
maintained
a
trading
post
after
the
arrival
of
katō
the
two
divisions
marched
towards
the
capital
reducing
without
difficulty
the
castles
that
lay
in
their
way
the
greatest
terror
prevailed
among
the
inhabitants
and
the
court
with
king
riyen
at
its
head
resolved
to
flee
into
the
province
bordering
on
china
the
armies
reached
the
capital
and
then
set
out
northward
the
dissensions
between
the
commanders
had
by
this
time
reached
such
a
point
that
they
determined
to
separate
katō
traversed
the
northeastern
provinces
and
in
his
course
captured
many
koreans
of
rank
konishi
marched
to
the
north
and
found
the
king
at
pingshang
on
the
borders
of
the
river
here
he
was
joined
by
kuroda
noritaka
whom
the
jesuit
fathers
named
condera
combiendono
and
by
yoshitoshi
the
prince
of
tsushima
who
had
marched
with
their
forces
by
a
different
route
an
effort
at
negotiations
at
this
point
met
with
no
success
the
king
continued
his
flight
northward
to
ichiu
a
fortified
town
on
the
borders
of
china
after
he
left
a
sharp
contest
took
place
between
the
besiegers
and
defenders
which
resulted
in
the
abandonment
of
the
town
and
its
capture
by
the
japanese
the
stores
of
grain
which
had
been
collected
by
the
koreans
were
captured
with
the
town
konishi
was
anxious
to
conduct
further
military
operations
in
connection
with
the
japanese
vessels
which
had
been
lying
all
this
time
at
fusan
directions
were
accordingly
sent
to
have
the
junks
sent
round
to
the
western
coast
the
koreans
picked
up
courage
to
show
fight
with
their
vessels
which
seemed
to
have
been
of
a
superior
construction
to
those
of
their
enemies
they
allured
the
japanese
boats
out
to
sea
and
then
turned
upon
them
suddenly
and
treated
them
so
roughly
that
they
were
glad
to
get
back
to
the
protection
of
the
harbor
and
to
give
up
the
purpose
of
cruising
along
the
western
coast
the
result
of
this
little
success
encouraged
the
koreans
so
much
that
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
a
turning
point
in
the
invasion
in
the
meantime
the
piteous
appeals
of
the
koreans
to
china
had
produced
some
effect
a
small
army
of
five
thousand
men
which
was
raised
in
the
adjoining
province
of
laotung
was
sent
to
their
aid
this
insufficient
force
rashly
undertook
to
attack
the
japanese
in
pingshang
but
they
led
the
invaders
into
the
town
and
then
so
thoroughly
routed
them
that
the
escaped
remnants
made
their
way
back
to
laotung
this
experience
led
the
chinese
officials
to
see
that
if
they
wished
to
help
the
koreans
at
all
they
must
despatch
a
stronger
force
this
they
set
to
work
at
once
to
do
they
endeavored
to
gain
some
time
by
pretending
to
enter
upon
negotiations
for
an
armistice
during
the
autumn
months
of
the
japanese
troops
were
almost
idle
and
they
were
very
much
taken
by
surprise
when
near
the
end
of
the
year
the
chinese
army
forty
thousand
strong
besides
koreans
made
its
appearance
on
the
scene
the
japanese
commander
had
no
time
to
call
for
help
and
before
he
realized
the
imminency
of
the
danger
pingshang
was
attacked
being
far
outnumbered
konishi
deemed
it
prudent
to
make
his
escape
from
the
beleaguered
town
and
to
save
his
army
by
a
retreat
which
was
a
painful
and
inglorious
one
the
other
division
of
the
japanese
army
under
katō
who
had
occupied
the
west
coast
found
its
position
untenable
with
a
superior
chinese
army
threatening
it
it
also
was
compelled
to
retreat
towards
the
south
but
the
veteran
army
of
katō
was
not
content
to
yield
all
that
it
had
gained
without
a
struggle
a
bloody
engagement
followed
near
pachiung
in
which
the
chinese
and
korean
army
suffered
a
significant
defeat
the
chinese
army
then
retired
to
pingshang
and
katō
was
not
in
a
condition
to
follow
it
over
the
impassable
winter
roads
and
with
deficient
supplies
the
japanese
troops
had
suffered
an
experience
such
as
never
befell
them
under
the
redoubtable
leadership
of
hideyoshi
and
the
chinese
had
had
enough
of
the
terrible
swords
which
the
japanese
soldier
could
wield
so
effectively
the
chief
obstacle
to
peace
was
the
mutual
distrust
with
which
each
of
the
three
parties
regarded
the
others
korea
hated
the
japanese
with
a
perfect
and
justifiable
hatred
she
also
feared
and
despised
the
pompous
and
pretentious
pride
of
china
but
in
the
negotiations
which
ensued
the
country
which
had
suffered
most
had
least
to
say
it
remained
for
the
two
greater
powers
to
come
to
some
agreement
which
should
be
satisfactory
to
them
and
whether
korea
were
satisfied
or
not
was
of
secondary
moment
the
japanese
envoy
proceeded
to
peking
and
is
said
to
have
negotiated
peace
on
these
conditions
that
the
emperor
of
china
should
grant
to
hideyoshi
the
honor
of
investiture
that
the
japanese
troops
should
all
leave
korea
and
that
japan
should
engage
never
to
invade
korea
again
there
was
some
jangling
about
the
withdrawal
of
the
japanese
soldiers
but
at
last
this
matter
was
arranged
an
embassy
was
sent
by
the
chinese
government
to
japan
to
carry
out
the
ceremony
of
investiture
they
arrived
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
taikō
sama
made
elaborate
preparations
for
their
reception
some
fears
were
felt
as
to
how
taikō
sama
would
regard
this
proposition
of
investiture
when
he
came
to
understand
it
the
buddhist
priest
who
was
to
translate
the
chinese
document
into
japanese
for
the
benefit
of
taikō
sama
was
urged
to
make
some
modification
in
the
wording
to
conciliate
his
ambition
but
he
was
too
honest
to
depart
from
the
true
rendering
he
read
to
taikō
sama
and
the
assembled
court
a
letter
from
the
chinese
emperor
granting
him
investiture
as
king
of
japan
and
announced
having
sent
by
the
ambassadors
the
robe
and
the
golden
seal
pertaining
to
the
office
taikō
sama
listened
with
amazement
as
he
for
the
first
time
realized
that
the
emperor
of
china
by
this
document
had
undertaken
to
invest
him
as
king
of
japan
instead
of
ming
emperor
he
was
in

uncontrollable

tore
off
the

which
he
had
put
on

snatched
the

from
the
reader
and
tore
it
into
shreds
exclaiming
since
i
have
the
whole
of
this
country
in
my
grasp
did
i
wish
to
become
its
emperor
i
could
do
so
without

consent
of

was
with
difficulty
restrained
from
taking
the
life
of
the
japanese
ambassador
who
had
negotiated
the

he
sent
word
to
the
chinese
envoys
who
had
brought
the
robe
and
seal
to
begone
back
to
their
country
and
to
tell
their
emperor
that
he
would
send
troops
to
slaughter
them
like
cattle
both
korea
and
china
knew
that
a
new
invasion
would
surely
result
from
this
disappointment
katō
and
konishi
the
japanese
generals
in
the
previous
campaign
and
who
had
gone
home
during
the
interval
were
ordered
back
to
take
command
of
the
old
troops
and
of
fresh
recruits
which
were
to
be
sent
they
busied
themselves
with
repairing
the
fortifications
which
had
been
left
in
possession
of
the
japanese
garrisons
the
disgraced
and
frightened
chinese
ambassadors
made
their
way
back
to
peking
they
were
ashamed
to
present
themselves
without
showing
something
in
return
for
the
gifts
they
had
carried
to
taikō
sama
they
purchased
some
velvets
and
scarlet
cloth
which
they
represented
as
the
presents
which
had
been
sent
they
pretended
that
taikō
sama
was
much
pleased
with
the
investiture
and
that
his
invasion
of
korea
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
korean
government
had
interfered
to
prevent
the
free
and
kindly
intercourse
between
china
and
japan
the
cloth
and
velvet
however
were
at
once
recognized
as
european
productions
and
not
derived
from
japan
so
the
ambassadors
were
charged
with
deceit
and
at
last
confessed
the
japanese
army
was
reinforced
it
is
said
with
fresh
troops
supplies
however
were
difficult
to
obtain
and
the
movements
were
much
hindered
a
small
chinese
army
of
men
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
aid
the
koreans
an
attack
on
the
japanese
ships
at
fusan
was
made
by
the
korean
navy
but
it
was
without
difficulty
repelled
and
most
of
the
attacking
ships
destroyed
after
some
material
advantages
which
however
were
not
decisive
the
japanese
troops
were
forced
to
return
to
fusan
for
the
winter
the
principal
engagement
was
at
a
strong
position
accessible
both
by
sea
and
land
it
was
garrisoned
by
troops
of
katō
s
division
who
were
brave
and
determined
the
army
composed
of
chinese
and
koreans
under
the
chinese
laid
siege
to
this
fortress
and
succeeded
in
cutting
off
all
its
communications
but
kuroda
and
hachisuka
came
to
katō
s
assistance
and
compelled
the
chinese
general
to
raise
the
siege
and
retreat
to
söul
the
korean
capital
it
was
in
one
of
the
battles
fought
during
the
summer
of
that
heads
of
chinese
and
korean
soldiers
are
said
to
have
been
taken
the
heads
were
buried
in
a
mound
after
the
ears
and
noses
had
been
cut
off
these
grewsome
relics
of
savage
warfare
were
pickled
in
tubs
and
sent
home
to
kyōto
where
they
were
deposited
in
a
mound
in
the
grounds
of
the
temple
of
daibutsu
and
over
them
a
monument
erected
which
is
marked
or
there
the
mound
and
monument
can
be
seen
to
this
day
the
death
of
taikō
sama
occurred
on
the
day
equivalent
to
the
of
september
and
on
his
he
seems
to
have
been
troubled
with
the
thought
of
the
veteran
warriors
who
were
uselessly
wearing
out
their
lives
in
korea
in
his
last
moments
he
opened
his
eyes
and
exclaimed
earnestly
let
not
the
spirits
of
the
hundred
thousand
troops
i
have
sent
to
korea
become
disembodied
in
a
foreign
ieyasu
on
whom
devolved
the
military
responsibility
after
the
taikō
s
death
and
who
had
never
sympathized
with
his
wishes
and
aims
regarding
korea
did
not
delay
the
complete
withdrawal
of
the
troops
which
still
remained
in
korea
thus
ended
a
chapter
in
the
history
of
japan
on
which
her
best
friends
can
look
back
with
neither
pride
nor
satisfaction
this
war
was
begun
without
any
sufficient
provocation
and
its
results
did
nothing
to
advance
the
glory
of
japan
or
its
soldiers
the
great
soldier
who
planned
it
and
pushed
it
on
with
relentless
energy
gained
nothing
from
it
except
vexation
much
of
the
time
during
which
the
war
lasted
he
sat
in
his
temporary
palace
at
nagoya
in
hizen
waiting
eagerly
for
news
from
his
armies
instead
of
tidings
of
victories
and
triumphs
and
rich
conquests
he
was
obliged
too
often
to
hear
of
the
dissensions
of
his
generals
the
starving
and
miseries
of
his
soldiers
and
the
curses
and
hatred
of
a
ruined
and
unhappy
country
all
that
he
had
to
show
for
his
expenditure
of
men
and
money
were
several
tubs
of
pickled
ears
and
noses
with
which
to
form
a
mound
in
the
temple
of
daibutsu
and
the
recollection
of
an
investiture
by
the
emperor
of
china
which
could
only
bring
to
him
pain
and
humiliation
the
only
beneficial
results
to
japan
that
can
be
traced
to
all
this
was
the
introduction
into
different
provinces
of
some
of
the
skilled
artisans
of
korea
the
prince
of
satsuma
shimazu
yoshihiro
in
brought
home
with
him
when
he
returned
from
the
korean
war
seventeen
families
of
korean
potters
who
were
settled
in
his
province
they
have
lived
there
ever
since
and
in
many
ways
still
retain
the
marks
of
their
nationality
it
is
to
them
that
satsuma
owes
its
exquisite
beauty
and
its
reputation
illustration
hideyoshi
when
the
taikō
realized
that
his
recovery
was
impossible
he
tried
to
arrange
the
affairs
of
the
empire
in
such
a
way
as
to
secure
a
continuation
of
the
power
in
his
son
hideyori
who
was
at
that
time
only
five
years
old
for
this
purpose
he
appointed
a
council
consisting
of
tokugawa
ieyasu
maeda
mōri
terumoto
ukita
and
uesugi
kagekatsu
of
which
ieyasu
was
the
president
and
chief
these
were
to
constitute
a
regency
during
his
son
s
minority
he
also
appointed
a
board
of
associates
who
were
called
middle
councillors
and
a
board
of
military
officers
called
he
called
all
these
councillors
and
military
officers
into
his
presence
before
he
died
and
made
them
swear
allegiance
to
his
successor
hideyori
there
seems
to
have
been
among
them
a
suspicion
of
the
fidelity
of
ieyasu
for
the
taikō
is
represented
as
saying
to
two
of
his
friends
you
need
not
be
anxious
about
ieyasu
he
will
not
rebel
against
my
house
cultivate
friendship
with
thus
in
his
year
died
september
the
greatest
soldier
if
not
the
greatest
man
whom
japan
has
produced
that
he
rose
from
obscurity
solely
by
his
own
talents
is
a
more
conspicuous
merit
in
japan
than
in
most
other
countries
family
and
heredity
have
always
counted
for
so
much
in
this
land
of
the
gods
that
few
instances
have
occurred
in
which
men
of
humble
birth
have
risen
to
eminence
that
one
such
in
spite
of
his
low
birth
in
spite
of
personal
infirmities
in
spite
of
the
opposition
and
envy
of
contemporaries
had
risen
to
so
high
a
position
in
the
empire
has
been
a
source
of
pride
and
encouragement
to
thousands
of
his
countrymen
the
taikō
was
buried
close
to
the
daibutsu
temple
which
he
himself
had
built
to
shelter
the
colossal
figure
of
buddha
constructed
in
imitation
of
the
daibutsu
which
yoritomo
had
built
at
kamakura
the
figure
was
to
be
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
in
height
and
the
workmen
had
it
nearly
finished
when
a
terrible
earthquake
in
shook
down
the
building
in
the
following
year
the
temple
was
rebuilt
and
the
image
was
completed
up
to
the
neck
the
workmen
were
preparing
to
cast
the
head
when
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
scaffolding
and
again
destroyed
the
temple
and
also
the
image
it
was
one
of
the
schemes
of
ieyasu
so
it
is
said
to
induce
the
young
hideyori
to
exhaust
his
resources
upon
such
expensive
projects
and
thus
render
him
incapable
of
resisting
any
serious
movement
against
himself
he
therefore
suggested
to
the
boy
and
his
mother
that
this
temple
and
image
which
hideyoshi
had
begun
should
not
fail
of
erection
they
therefore
resumed
the
construction
and
carried
it
on
with
great
lavishness
it
took
until
to
complete
the
work
and
when
it
was
about
to
be
consecrated
with
imposing
ceremonies
ieyasu
who
by
this
time
was
supreme
in
the
empire
suddenly
forbade
the
progress
of
the
ceremony
he
affected
to
be
offended
by
the
inscription
which
had
been
put
on
the
bell
but
the
real
reason
was
probably
his
desire
to
find
some
pretext
by
which
he
could
put
a
quarrel
upon
the
adherents
of
hideyori
chapter
x
the
founding
of
the
tokugawa
shōgunate
among
all
the
friends
and
retainers
of
hideyoshi
the
most
prominent
and
able
was
tokugawa
ieyasu
he
was
six
years
younger
than
hideyoshi
and
therefore
in
when
the
taikō
died
he
was
years
old
he
was
born
at
the
village
of
matsudaira
in
the
province
of
mikawa
his
family
counted
its
descent
from
minamoto
who
in
the
eleventh
century
had
by
his
military
prowess
in
the
wars
against
the
ainos
earned
the
heroic
name
of
therefore
he
was
as
custom
and
tradition
now
for
a
long
time
had
required
for
those
holding
the
office
of
shōgun
a
descendant
from
the
minamoto
family
the
name
tokugawa
which
ieyasu
rendered
famous
was
derived
from
a
village
in
the
province
of
shimotsuke
where
his
ancestors
had
lived
his
first
experiences
in
war
were
under
nobunaga
side
by
side
with
hideyoshi
he
proved
himself
not
only
a
capable
soldier
prudent
and
painstaking
but
also
a
good
administrator
in
times
of
peace
hideyoshi
had
such
confidence
in
him
and
so
much
doubt
about
the
wisdom
of
requiring
the
guardians
to
wait
until
his
son
a
mere
child
five
years
old
had
grown
up
to
years
of
responsibility
that
he
is
represented
as
having
said
to
ieyasu
i
foresee
that
there
will
be
great
wars
after
my
decease
i
know
too
that
there
is
no
one
but
you
who
can
keep
the
country
quiet
i
therefore
bequeath
the
whole
country
to
you
and
trust
you
will
expend
all
your
strength
in
governing
it
my
son
hideyori
is
still
young
i
beg
you
will
look
after
him
when
he
is
grown
up
i
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
he
will
be
my
successor
or
as
soon
as
the
taikō
was
dead
and
the
attempt
was
made
to
set
in
motion
the
machinery
he
had
designed
for
governing
the
country
troubles
began
to
manifest
themselves
the
princes
whom
he
had
appointed
as
members
of
his
governing
boards
began
immediately
to
quarrel
among
themselves
on
ieyasu
devolved
the
duty
of
regulating
the
affairs
of
the
government
for
this
purpose
he
resided
at
fushimi
which
is
a
suburb
of
kyōto
his
most
active
opponent
was
ishida
mitsunari
who
had
been
appointed
one
of
the
five
or
governors
under
the
taikō
s
arrangement
they
grew
jealous
of
ieyasu
because
under
the
existing
order
of
things
the
governors
were
of
very
minor
importance
mitsunari
had
acquired
his
influence
with
the
taikō
not
through
military
achievements
but
by
intrigue
and
flattery
he
was
cordially
detested
by
such
disinterested
friends
as
katō
kiyomasa
and
others
the
ground
on
which
the
opposition
to
ieyasu
was
based
was
that
he
was
not
faithfully
performing
his
duty
as
he
had
promised
to
the
dying
taikō
towards
his
child
and
heir
it
is
not
improbable
that
even
at
this
early
day
it
was
seen
that
ieyasu
proposed
to
disregard
the
pretensions
of
the
youthful
son
of
hideyoshi
in
the
same
way
that
he
in
his
day
had
disregarded
the
claims
of
the
heir
of
nobunaga
the
rough
and
warlike
times
and
the
restless
and
ambitious
manners
of
the
feudal
lords
of
these
times
made
it
impossible
to
entrust
the
country
to
the
hands
of
a
child
under
this
strained
relation
the
members
of
the
regency
divided
into
two
parties
speaking
broadly
it
was
again
a
contest
between
the
north
and
the
south
of
japan
ieyasu
s
association
had
been
from
the
beginning
with
the
kwantō
and
now
more
than
ever
his
power
was
centred
about
yedo
mitsunari
on
the
contrary
had
leagued
himself
with
the
princes
of
chōsū
and
satsuma
and
with
others
of
minor
importance
all
more
or
less
representative
of
the
southern
half
of
the
empire
the
christians
chiefly
sided
with
hideyori
and
his
adherents
mitsunari
himself
was
a
christian
convert
and
the
jesuit
fathers
explain
that
his
position
and
that
of
the
other
christian
leaders
were
due
to
their
conscientious
desire
to
fulfil
their
oath
of
fidelity
to
hideyori
that
ieyasu
should
have
been
derelict
in
such
a
solemn
duty
was
a
sufficient
cause
for
their
opposition
to
him
events
now
rushed
rapidly
to
a
culmination
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
princes
allied
against
ieyasu
was
uesugi
kagekatsu
the
lord
of
echigo
and
aizu
he
had
retired
to
aizu
after
having
solemnly
made
a
covenant
with
the
others
engaged
in
the
plot
to
take
measures
against
ieyasu
he
was
summoned
to
kyōto
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
emperor
but
on
some
trivial
excuse
he
declined
to
come
ieyasu
now
saw
that
nothing
but
war
would
settle
the
disputes
which
had
arisen
he
repaired
to
yedo
and
to
shimotsuké
and
made
preparations
for
the
conflict
which
he
saw
impending
in
the
meantime
the
members
of
the
league
were
busy
mitsunari
sent
an
urgent
circular
to
all
the
feudal
princes
charging
ieyasu
with
certain
misdeeds
and
crimes
the
chief
of
which
was
that
instead
of
guarding
the
inheritance
of
the
taikō
for
his
son
he
was
with
the
blackest
guilt
endeavoring
to
seize
it
for
himself
a
formidable
army
was
gathered
at
ōsaka
consisting
of
men
made
up
as
it
was
from
different
provinces
and
officered
by
its
provincial
leaders
it
lacked
that
element
of
unity
and
accord
which
is
so
essential
to
an
army
the
first
movement
was
against
the
castle
of
fushimi
which
was
the
centre
from
which
ieyasu
governed
the
country
after
a
short
siege
it
fell
and
then
it
is
said
was
accidentally
burned
to
the
ground
the
news
of
the
attack
upon
fushimi
was
brought
to
ieyasu
in
shimotsuké
and
a
council
of
his
friends
and
retainers
was
held
to
determine
what
steps
must
be
taken
to
meet
the
emergency
it
was
urged
that
the
time
had
come
when
ieyasu
should
meet
his
enemies
and
settle
by
battle
the
questions
which
had
risen
between
them
it
was
determined
that
all
the
scattered
troops
should
be
gathered
together
and
that
they
should
march
to
fushimi
prepared
to
encounter
the
enemy
in
battle
at
whatever
point
they
should
meet
them
the
eldest
son
of
ieyasu
hideyasu
was
put
in
charge
of
yedo
and
entrusted
with
the
care
of
the
surrounding
provinces
this
was
an
important
trust
because
the
powerful
prince
uesugi
lay
to
the
north
of
him
and
would
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
attack
him
to
fukushima
was
given
the
command
of
the
vanguard
the
principal
army
was
divided
into
two
parts
one
of
which
was
to
march
along
the
tōkaidō
under
the
command
of
ieyasu
himself
the
other
was
placed
under
the
charge
of
ieyasu
s
second
son
hidetada
and
was
to
take
the
route
along
the
nakasendō
the
whole
army
consisted
of
men
a
number
much
smaller
than
the
army
of
the
league
but
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
controlled
by
one
mastering
and
experienced
commander
the
armies
met
at
sekigahara
a
little
village
on
the
nakasendō
october
one
place
on
the
neighboring
hill
is
still
pointed
out
whence
ieyasu
witnessed
the
battle
and
issued
his
orders
both
sides
fought
with
determined
bravery
and
the
battle
lasted
the
whole
day

and
other
firearms
were
to
some
extent
made
use
of
but
the
weapons
the
sword
and
the
spear
were
the
terrible
means
by
which
the
victory
was
decided
for
a
long
time
the
battle
raged
without
either
party
obtaining
a
decisive
advantage
notwithstanding
his
inferiority
in
numbers
ieyasu
was
completely
victorious
the
carnage
was
dreadful
the
number
of
the
confederate
army
said
to
have
been
killed
was
this
seems
like
an
impossible
exaggeration
and
the
japanese
annalists
are
like
those
of
other
nations
given
to
heightened
statements
but
that
the
loss
of
life
on
both
sides
was
very
great
there
can
be
no
doubt
two
ghastly
mounds
called
or
head
piles
are
still
shown
where
the
heads
of
the
decapitated
confederates
were
buried
this
battle
must
always
stand
with
that
at
between
the
minamoto
and
taira
families
as
one
of
the
decisive
battles
in
the
history
of
japan
by
it
was
settled
the
fate
of
the
country
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
it
was
fortunate
that
the
victor
in
this
battle
was
a
man
who
knew
how
to
secure
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
victory
it
is
said
that
at
the
close
of
this
battle
when
he
saw
success
perching
on
his
banners
he
repeated
to
those
around
him
the
old
japanese
proverb
after
victory
tighten
the
strings
of
your
the
division
of
hidetada
joined
him
after
the
battle
and
he
promptly
followed
up
his
victory
by
seizing
the
castles
on
his
way
and
taking
possession
of
kyōto
and
ōsaka
the
feudal
princes
who
had
stood
aloof
or
opposed
him
nearly
all
came
forward
and
submitted
themselves
to
his
authority
uesugi
and
satake
in
the
north
who
had
been
among
his
most
active
opponents
at
once
presented
themselves
to
hideyasu
at
yedo
and
made
their
submission
mōri
the
powerful
lord
of
the
western
provinces
who
had
been
most
active
in
the
confederation
against
him
sent
congratulations
on
his
victory
but
they
were
coldly
received
finally
he
was
pardoned
being
however
deprived
of
six
out
of
his
eight
provinces
he
was
suffered
to
retain
of
all
his
rich
inheritance
only
suō
and
nagato
several
of
the
leaders
were
captured
among
whom
were
mitsunari
konishi
and
ōtani
who
being
christians
deemed
it
unworthy
their
faith
to
commit
they
were
carried
to
kyōto
where
they
were
beheaded
and
their
heads
exposed
in
the
dry
bed
of
the
the
work
of
reducing
to
order
the
island
of
kyūshū
was
entrusted
to
the
veteran
generals
katō
kiyomasa
and
kuroda
yoshitaka
the
former
undertook
the
reduction
of
hizen
and
the
latter
that
of
bungo
buzen
and
chikuzen
the
house
of
shimazu
although
it
had
taken
sides
against
ieyasu
in
the
great
contest
duly
made
its
submission
and
was
treated
with
great
consideration
the
whole
of
the
territory
assigned
to
it
by
hideyoshi
after
the
war
of
was
restored
to
it
namely
the
whole
of
the
provinces
of
satsuma
and
ōsumi
and
one
half
of
the
province
of
hyūga
to
katō
kiyomasa
was
given
the
province
of
higo
which
had
after
the
korean
war
been
assigned
to
konishi
in
recognition
of
his
services
but
which
was
now
taken
from
his
family
because
he
had
been
one
of
ieyasu
s
active
opponents
the
kuroda
family
received
as
its
inheritance
a
portion
of
the
province
of
chikuzen
with
its
capital
at
fukuoka
which
it
held
until
the
abolition
of
feudal
tenures
in
ieyasu
was
a
peaceful
and
moderate
character
and
in
the
settlement
of
the
disturbances
which
had
marked
his
advent
to
power
he
is
notable
for
having
pursued
a
course
of
great
kindness
and
consideration
with
the
exception
of
the
cases
already
mentioned
there
were
no
executions
for
political
offences
it
was
his
desire
and
ambition
to
establish
a
system
of
government
which
should
be
continuous
and
not
liable
like
those
of
nobunaga
and
taikō
sama
to
be
overturned
at
the
death
of
him
who
had
founded
it
by
the
gift
of
taikō
sama
he
had
already
in
his
possession
a
large
part
of
the
kwantō
and
by
the
result
of
the
war
which
had
ended
at
sekigahara
he
had
come
into
possession
of
a
great
number
of
other
fiefs
with
which
he
could
reward
those
who
had
been
faithful
to
him
it
was
the
difficult
and
delicate
part
of
his
work
to
distribute
judiciously
among
his
supporters
and
retainers
the
confiscated
estates
to
realize
how
completely
the
feudal
system
as
reformed
by
ieyasu
was
bound
to
him
and
constituted
to
support
and
perpetuate
his
family
it
is
only
necessary
to
examine
such
a
list
of
the
daimyōs
as
is
given
in
appert
s
out
of
the
two
hundred
and
daimyōs
there
enumerated
one
hundred
and
are
either
vassals
or
branches
of
the
tokugawa
family
but
while
he
thus
carefully
provided
the
supports
for
his
own
family
he
spared
many
of
the
old
and
houses
which
had
incorporated
themselves
into
the
history
of
the
country
he
built
his
structure
on
the
old
and
tried
foundation
stones
with
statesmanship
he
recognized
that
every
new
form
of
government
to
be
permanent
must
be
a
development
from
that
which
precedes
it
and
must
include
within
itself
whatever
is
lasting
in
the
nature
of
its
forerunner
the
dual
form
of
government
had
for
many
centuries
existed
in
japan
and
the
customs
and
habits
of
thinking
and
the
modes
of
administering
justice
and
of
controlling
the
conduct
of
men
had
become
adapted
to
this
system
it
was
therefore
natural
that
ieyasu
should
turn
his
attention
to
reforming
and
perfecting
such
a
form
of
government
a
scheme
of
this
kind
seemed
best
adapted
to
a
country
in
which
there
existed
on
the
one
hand
an
emperor
of
divine
origin
honored
of
all
men
but
who
by
long
neglect
had
become
unfit
to
govern
and
in
whom
was
lodged
only
the
source
of
honor
and
on
the
other
hand
an
executive
department
on
which
devolved
the
practical
duty
of
governing
organizing
maintaining
and
defending
though
he
was
compelled
to
look
back
through
centuries
of
misrule
and
through
long
periods
of
war
and
usurpation
he
could
see
straight
to
yoritomo
the
first
of
the
shōguns
and
could
trace
from
him
a
clear
descent
in
the
minamoto
family
to
this
task
therefore
he
set
himself
to
maintain
the
empire
in
all
its
purity
and
to
create
a
line
of
hereditary
shōguns
who
should
constitute
its
executive
department
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
he
sent
his
son
hidetada
to
the
emperor
to
make
a
full
report
of
everything
that
had
been
done
in
the
settlement
of
the
affairs
of
the
country
the
emperor
was
graciously
pleased
to
approve
his
acts
and
to
bestow
upon
him
the
hereditary
title
of
this
was
the
title
borne
by
yoritomo
when
he
was
the
real
ruler
of
the
country
since
that
time
there
had
been
a
long
line
of
shōguns
the
last
of
whom
was
ashikaga
yoshiaki
whom
nobunaga
deposed
in
and
who
had
died
with
this
new
appointment
began
a
line
of
tokugawa
shōguns
that
ended
only
with
the
restoration
in
ieyasu
s
most
radical
change
in
the
system
of
government
consisted
in
the
establishment
of
the
seat
of
his
executive
department
at
yedo
since
kyōto
had
been
the
capital
where
successive
emperors
had
reigned
and
where
nobunaga
and
hideyoshi
exercised
executive
control
kamakura
had
been
the
seat
of
yoritomo
and
his
successors
but
ieyasu
saw
advantages
in
establishing
himself
in
a
new
field
to
which
the
traditions
of
idleness
and
effeminacy
had
not
attached
themselves
and
where
the
associations
of
his
own
warlike
career
would
act
as
a
stimulus
to
his
contemporaries
and
successors
he
remained
at
fushimi
until
necessary
repairs
could
be
made
to
the
castle
of
yedo
and
the
roads
between
it
and
the
capital
put
in
order
the
place
which
henceforth
was
to
be
the
principal
capital
of
the
country
first
comes
into
notice
as
we
have
before
mentioned
as
a
castle
built
by
ōta
dōkwan
in
he
had
been
placed
here
by
the
authorities
of
kamakura
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
restless
princes
of
the
north
recognizing
the
strength
and
convenience
of
the
high
grounds
on
the
border
of
yedo
bay
he
built
a
castle
which
through
many
transformations
and
enlargements
finally
developed
into
the
great
feudal
capital
of
the
tokugawa
shōguns
it
was
here
that
ieyasu
after
the
fall
of
odawara
by
the
advice
of
hideyoshi
established
himself
for
the
government
of
the
provinces
of
the
kwantō
which
had
been
given
to
him
and
it
was
without
doubt
this
earlier
experience
which
led
him
to
select
yedo
as
the
centre
of
his
feudal
government
the
reputation
which
this
eastern
region
bore
for
roughness
and
want
of
culture
as
compared
with
the
capital
of
the
emperor
at
kyōto
seemed
to
him
an
advantage
rather
than
an
objection
he
could
here
build
up
a
system
of
government
free
from
the
faults
and
weaknesses
which
had
become
inseparable
from
the
old
seats
of
power
after
the
repairs
and
enlargements
had
been
completed
he
took
up
his
residence
there
besides
this
castle
ieyasu
had
for
his
private
residence
especially
after
his
retirement
from
the
shōgunate
an
establishment
at
sumpu
now
called
shizuoka
here
he
was
visited
by
english
and
dutch
envoys
in
reference
to
the
terms
of
allowing
trade
and
here
after
the
manner
of
his
country
he
maintained
his
hold
upon
the
administration
of
affairs
notwithstanding
his
formal
retirement
a
continued
source
of
disquietude
and
danger
to
the
empire
or
at
least
to
the
plans
of
ieyasu
for
a
dynasty
of
tokugawa
shōguns
lay
in
hideyori
the
son
and
heir
of
taikō
sama
he
was
born
in
and
was
therefore
at
this
time
in
his
year
as
long
as
he
lived
he
would
be
naturally
and
inevitably
the
centre
to
which
all
the
disaffected
elements
of
the
country
would
gravitate
the
failure
of
ieyasu
to
support
the
cause
of
his
old
master
s
son
would
always
prove
a
source
of
weakness
to
him
especially
in
a
country
where
fidelity
to
parents
and
superiors
was
held
in
such
high
esteem
he
determined
therefore
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
these
threatening
troubles
which
had
so
long
been
hanging
over
him
accordingly
on
the
ground
that
hideyori
was
plotting
with
his
enemies
against
the
peace
of
the
state
he
set
out
from
sumpu
where
he
was
then
residing
as
retired
shōgun
with
an
army
of
seventy
thousand
men
hideyori
and
his
mother
had
for
a
long
time
resided
at
the
castle
of
ōsaka
and
against
this
ieyasu
directed
his
large
army
it
was
bravely
and
skilfully
defended
and
without
the
help
of
artillery
which
at
this
early
day
was
rarely
used
in
sieges
a
long
time
elapsed
before
any
decided
advantage
was
gained
at
last
the
defenders
were
tempted
beyond
the
protection
of
their
fortifications
and
a
battle
was
fought
june
it
is
described
by
the
jesuit
fathers
two
of
whom
witnessed
it
as
being
sanguinary
beyond
the
example
of
the
bloody
battles
of
the
japanese
civil
wars
it
resulted
in
the
complete
overthrow
of
hideyori
s
adherents
and
the
destruction
of
the
castle
by
fire
both
hideyori
and
his
mother
were
said
to
have
perished
in
the
conflagration
reports
were
current
that
they
had
however
escaped
and
taken
refuge
in
some
friendly
locality
but
no
trace
of
them
was
ever
found
and
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
this
was
the
end
of
hideyori
and
his
party
before
ending
this
chapter
which
is
designed
to
record
the
establishment
of
the
tokugawa
shōguns
reference
should
be
made
to
the
settlement
of
the
questions
left
in
dispute
by
taikō
sama
respecting
korea
there
remained
after
the
war
with
all
its
attendant
atrocities
and
sufferings
a
feeling
of
intense
bitterness
towards
the
japanese
on
the
part
both
of
the
koreans
and
chinese
the
absence
of
any
sufficient
cause
for
the
invasion
and
the
avowed
purpose
of
taikō
sama
to
extend
his
conquests
to
china
had
awakened
against
him
and
his
armies
a
hatred
which
generations
could
not
wipe
out
soon
after
the
recall
of
the
japanese
troops
which
followed
the
death
of
taikō
sama
ieyasu
opened
negotiations
with
korea
through
the
daimyō
of
tsushima
he
caused
the
government
to
be
informed
that
any
friendly
overtures
on
its
part
would
be
received
in
a
like
spirit
the
king
of
korea
accordingly
despatched
an
embassy
with
an
autograph
letter
addressed
to
the
king
of
a
translation
of
this
letter
will
be
found
in
aston
s
last
paper
on
hideyoshi
s
invasion
of
korea
among
other
things
it
says
the
sovereign
and
subjects
of
this
country
were
profoundly
grieved
and
felt
that
they
could
not
live
under
the
same
heaven
with
your
country
however
your
country
has
now
reformed
the
errors
of
the
past
dynasty
and
practises
the
former
friendly
relations
if
this
be
so
is
it
not
a
blessing
to
the
people
of
both
countries
we
have
therefore
sent
you
the
present
embassy
in
token
of
friendship
the
enclosed
paper
contains
a
list
of
some
poor
productions
of
our
country
be
pleased
to
understand
this
letter
was
dated
in
the
year
a
friendly
answer
was
returned
to
it
and
from
this
time
it
may
be
understood
that
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
were
placed
on
a
satisfactory
basis
these
steps
were
taken
on
the
part
of
korea
with
the
knowledge
and
approval
of
china
which
now
claimed
to
hold
a
protectorate
over
the
peninsula
of
korea
the
same
negotiations
therefore
which
resulted
in
peaceful
relations
with
korea
brought
about
a
condition
of
amity
with
china
which
was
not
disturbed
until
very
recent
times
the
ruinous
effects
of
this
invasion
however
were
never
overcome
in
korea
itself
her
cities
had
been
destroyed
her
industries
blotted
out
and
her
fertile
fields
rendered
desolate
once
she
had
been
the
fruitful
tree
from
which
japan
was
glad
to
gather
her
arts
and
civilization
but
now
she
was
only
a
branchless
trunk
which
the
fires
of
war
had
charred
and
left

chapter
xi
christianity
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
the
readers
of
the
story
of
japan
the
most
interesting
episode
is
that
of
the
introduction
and
subsequent
extirpation
of
christianity
we
have
therefore
given
an
account
of
the
first
arrival
of
the
jesuit
missionaries
with
the
sainted
xavier
at
their
head
and
we
have
seen
their
labors
crowned
with
a
very
wide
success
during
the
times
of
nobunaga
and
hideyoshi
the
question
had
assumed
something
of
a
political
aspect
in
several
of
the
provinces
of
kyūshū
the
princes
had
become
converts
and
had
freely
used
their
influence
and
sometimes
their
authority
to
extend
christianity
among
their
subjects
in
kyōto
and
yamaguchi
in
ōsaka
and
sakai
as
well
as
in
kyūshū
the
jesuit
fathers
had
founded
flourishing
churches
and
exerted
a
wide
influence
they
had
established
colleges
where
the
candidates
for
the
church
could
be
educated
and
trained
they
had
organized
hospitals
and
asylums
at
nagasaki
and
elsewhere
where
those
needing
aid
could
be
received
and
treated
it
is
true
that
the
progress
of
the
work
had
met
with
a
severe
setback
in
when
taikō
sama
issued
an
edict
expelling
all
foreign
religious
teachers
from
japan
in
pursuance
of
this
edict
nine
foreigners
who
had
evaded
expulsion
were
burnt
at
nagasaki
the
reason
for
this
decisive
action
on
the
part
of
taikō
sama
is
usually
attributed
to
the
suspicion
which
had
been
awakened
in
him
by
the
loose
and
unguarded
talk
of
a
portuguese
sea
captain
but
other
causes
undoubtedly
contributed
to
produce
in
him
this
intolerant
frame
of
mind
indeed
the
idea
of
toleration
as
applied
to
religious
belief
had
not
yet
been
admitted
even
in
europe
at
this
very
time
philip
who
had
united
in
his
own
person
the
kingdoms
of
spain
and
portugal
was
endeavoring
to
compel
by
force
of
arms
the
netherlands
to
accept
his
religious
belief
and
was
engaged
throughout
all
his
immense
dominions
in
the
task
of
reducing
men
s
minds
to
a
hideous
uniformity
even
in
several
of
the
provinces
of
japan
where
the
jesuits
had
attained
the
ascendancy
the
most
forcible
measures
had
been
taken
by
the
christian
princes
to
compel
all
their
subjects
to
follow
their
own
example
and
adopt
the
christian
faith
takeyama
whom
the
jesuit
fathers
designate
as
justo
ucondono
carried
out
in
his
territory
at
akashi
a
system
of
bitter
persecution
he
gave
his
subjects
the
option
of
becoming
christians
or
leaving
his
territory
konishi
yukinaga
who
received
part
of
the
province
of
higo
as
his
fief
after
the
korean
war
enforced
with
great
persistency
the
acceptance
of
the
christian
faith
and
robbed
the
buddhist
priests
of
their
temples
and
their
lands
the
princes
of
ōmura
and
arima
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
princes
of
bungo
followed
the
advice
of
the
jesuit
fathers
in
using
their
authority
to
advance
the
cause
of
christianity
the
fathers
could
scarcely
complain
of
having
the
system
of
intolerance
practised
upon
them
which
when
circumstances
were
favorable
they
had
advised
to
be
applied
to
their
opponents
it
was
this
impossibility
of
securing
peace
and
harmony
and
the
suspicion
of
the
territorial
ambition
of
spain
and
portugal
which
drove
taikō
sama
to
the
conclusion
that
the
foreign
religious
teachers
and
the
faith
which
they
had
so
successfully
propagated
were
a
source
of
imminent
danger
to
his
country
to
him
it
was
purely
a
political
question
he
had
no
deep
religious
impressions
which
had
led
him
to
prefer
the
precepts
of
the
old
japanese
faith
to
those
of
christianity
these
systems
could
not
apparently
live
together
and
it
seemed
to
him
the
safest
and
most
sensible
way
to
extinguish
the
weaker
and
most
dangerous
before
it
became
too
strong
hence
he
began
that
policy
of
repression
and
expulsion
which
his
successor
reluctantly
took
up
during
the
first
years
of
ieyasu
s
supremacy
the
christians
were
not
disturbed
he
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
establishment
of
the
new
executive
department
which
he
had
planned
in
the
portuguese
resident
bishop
father
louis
cerqueria
was
received
by
ieyasu
at
kyōto
the
fathers
speak
of
this
audience
with
great
hopefulness
and
did
not
seem
to
be
aware
that
the
court
which
most
of
the
christian
princes
were
at
that
time
paying
to
hideyori
was
likely
to
prejudice
ieyasu
against
them
again
in
ieyasu
who
was
then
at
kofu
in
the
province
of
kai
awaiting
the
completion
of
his
castle
at
yedo
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
provincial
accordingly
when
he
waited
on
ieyasu
he
was
received
very
cordially
the
christian
fathers
were
much
encouraged
by
these
indications
of
the
favor
of
ieyasu
but
whatever
they
may
have
been
they
can
not
be
interpreted
as
showing
any
intention
on
his
part
to
promote
their
religious
proselytism
even
in
the
very
midst
of
these
assumed
favors
he
issued
in
what
may
be
called
a
warning
proclamation
announcing
that
he
had
learned
with
pain
that
contrary
to
taikō
sama
s
edict
many
had
embraced
the
christian
religion
he
warned
all
officers
of
his
court
to
see
that
the
edict
was
strictly
enforced
he
declared
that
it
was
for
the
good
of
the
state
that
none
should
embrace
the
new
doctrine
and
that
such
as
had
already
done
so
must
change
immediately
this
proclamation
of
ieyasu
did
not
however
prevent
the
catholics
at
nagasaki
from
celebrating
in
a
gorgeous
manner
the
beatification
of
ignatius
loyola
the
founder
and
first
general
of
the
society
of
jesus
the
bishop
officiated
in
pontifical
robes
and
the
members
of
the
society
together
with
the
franciscans
dominicans
and
augustinians
made
a
solemn
procession
through
the
city
this
celebration
was
in
distinct
contravention
of
the
orders
which
had
been
issued
against
such
public
displays
it
was
made
more
emphatic
by
being
also
held
on
the
same
day
in
the
province
of
arima
whose
daimyō
was
an
ardent
advocate
of
the
christian
doctrine
these
open
and
determined
infractions
of
the
directions
of
the
government
provoked
ieyasu
to
take
severe
measures
he
began
by
punishing
some
of
the
native
christians
connected
with
his
own
court
who
were
charged
with
bribery
and
intrigue
in
behalf
of
the
daimyō
of
arima
a
number
of
these
accused
christians
were
banished
and
their
estates
confiscated
in
the
meantime
both
the
english
and
dutch
had
appeared
on
the
scene
as
will
be
more
fully
detailed
in
the
next
chapter
their
object
was
solely
trade
and
as
the
portuguese
monopoly
hitherto
had
been
mainly
secured
by
the
jesuit
fathers
it
was
natural
for
the
to
represent
the
motive
of
these
fathers
in
an
unfavorable
and
suspicious
light
indeed
as
hildreth
says
they
had
only
to
confirm
the
truth
of
what
the
portuguese
and
spanish
said
of
each
other
to
excite
in
the
minds
of
the
japanese
rulers
the
gravest
distrust
as
to
the
designs
of
the
priests
of
both
whether
it
is
true
as
charged
that
the
minds
of
the
japanese
rulers
had
been
poisoned
against
the
jesuit
fathers
by
misrepresentation
and
falsehood
it
may
be
impossible
to
determine
definitely
but
it
is
fair
to
infer
that
the
cruel
and
intolerant
policy
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
would
be
fully
set
forth
and
the
danger
to
the
japanese
empire
from
the
machinations
of
the
foreign
religious
teachers
held
up
in
the
worst
light
during
the
latter
years
of
ieyasu
s
life
after
he
had
settled
the
affairs
of
the
empire
and
put
the
shōgunate
upon
a
permanent
basis
we
see
growing
evidence
of
his
prejudice
against
christianity
that
he
had
such
prejudice
in
a
very
pronounced
form
is
clear
from
his
reference
to
the
false
and
corrupt
school
in
chapter
xxxi
of
the
and
he
had
inherited
from
taikō
sama
the
conviction
that
the
spread
of
this
foreign
faith
was
a
menace
to
the
peace
of
the
empire
the
instructions
which
were
issued
to
the
members
of
the
society
of
jesus
however
forbade
any
father
to
meddle
in
secular
affairs
or
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
political
concerns
of
the
government
in
which
they
were
laboring
that
there
were
occasional
instances
of
the
disregard
of
this
regulation
by
the
enthusiastic
members
of
the
order
may
be
supposed
but
it
will
be
unjust
and
unfounded
to
attribute
to
this
society
a
settled
policy
of
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
nations
where
they
were
employed
as
missionaries
ieyasu
evidently
having
made
up
his
mind
that
for
the
safety
of
the
empire
christianity
must
be
extirpated
in
issued
an
edict
that
the
members
of
all
religious
orders
whether
european
or
japanese
should
be
sent
out
of
the
country
that
the
churches
which
had
been
erected
in
various
localities
should
be
pulled
down
and
that
the
native
adherents
of
the
faith
should
be
compelled
to
renounce
it
in
part
execution
of
this
edict
all
the
members
of
the
society
of
jesus
native
and
foreign
were
ordered
to
be
sent
to
nagasaki
native
christians
were
sent
to
tsugaru
the
northern
extremity
of
the
main
island
takeyama
who
had
already
been
banished
by
taikō
sama
to
the
province
of
kaga
was
ordered
to
leave
the
country
he
was
sent
in
a
chinese
ship
to
manila
where
he
soon
after
died
in
order
to
repress
any
disturbance
that
might
arise
from
the
execution
of
this
edict
ten
thousand
troops
were
sent
to
kyūshū
where
the
converts
were
much
the
most
numerous
and
where
the
daimyōs
in
many
cases
either
openly
protected
or
indirectly
favored
the
new
faith
in
accordance
with
this
edict
as
many
as
three
hundred
persons
are
said
to
have
been
shipped
from
japan
october
all
the
resident
jesuits
were
included
in
this
number
excepting
eighteen
fathers
and
nine
brothers
who
concealed
themselves
and
thus
escaped
the
search
following
this
deportation
of
converts
the
most
persistent
efforts
continued
to
be
made
to
force
the
native
christians
to
renounce
their
faith
the
accounts
given
both
by
the
foreign
and
by
the
japanese
writers
of
the
persecutions
which
now
broke
upon
the
heads
of
the
christians
are
beyond
description
horrible
a
special
service
was
established
by
the
government
which
was
called
the
christian
enquiry
the
object
of
which
was
to
search
out
christians
in
every
quarter
and
drive
them
to
a
renunciation
of
their
faith
both
the
foreign
priests
who
had
remained
in
the
country
in
spite
of
the
edict
and
the
native
converts
were
hunted
down
and
punished
with
the
most
appalling
tortures
rewards
were
offered
for
information
involving
christians
of
every
position
and
rank
even
of
parents
against
their
children
and
of
children
against
their
parents
at
what
time
this
practice
began
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
that
rewards
were
used
at
an
early
period
is
evident
from
the
of
an
edict
in
in
which
it
is
stated
that
formerly
a
reward
of
pieces
of
silver
was
paid
for
denouncing
a
father
and
for
denouncing
a
brother
but
from
this
time
the
rewards
should
be
for
denouncing
a
father
pieces
a
brother
pieces
and
a
catechist
pieces
in
this
tariff
was
raised
for
denouncing
a
father
to
pieces
a
brother
to
pieces
and
a
catechist
to
pieces
also
for
denouncing
a
person
who
having
recanted
returned
to
the
faith
pieces
these
edicts
against
christianity
were
displayed
on
the
as
late
as
the
year
the
persecution
began
in
its
worst
form
about
this
was
the
year
in
which
ieyasu
died
but
his
son
and
successor
carried
out
the
terrible
programme
with
heartless
thoroughness
it
has
never
been
surpassed
for
cruelty
and
brutality
on
the
part
of
the
persecutors
or
for
courage
and
constancy
on
the
part
of
those
who
suffered
the
letters
of
the
jesuit
fathers
are
full
of
descriptions
of
the
shocking
trials
to
which
the
christians
were
subjected
the
tortures
inflicted
are
almost
beyond
belief
gubbins
in
the
paper
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
says
we
read
of
christians
being
executed
in
a
barbarous
manner
in
sight
of
each
other
of
their
being
hurled
from
the
tops
of
precipices
of
their
being
buried
alive
of
their
being
torn
asunder
by
oxen
of
their
being
tied
up
in
which
were
heaped
up
together
and
of
the
pile
thus
formed
being
set
on
fire
others
were
tortured
before
death
by
the
insertion
of
sharp
spikes
under
the
nails
of
their
hands
and
feet
while
some
poor
wretches
by
a
refinement
of
horrid
cruelty
were
shut
up
in
cages
and
there
left
to
starve
with
food
before
their
eyes
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
we
have
drawn
on
the
jesuit
accounts
solely
for
this
information
an
examination
of
the
japanese
records
will
show
that
the
case
is
not
the
region
around
nagasaki
was
most
fully
impregnated
with
the
new
doctrine
and
it
was
here
that
the
persecution
was
by
far
the
most
severe
this
was
now
an
imperial
city
governed
directly
by
officers
from
the
government
of
yedo
the
governor
is
called
kanwaytsdo
by
warenius
relying
on
caron
and
guysbert
but
i
have
been
unable
to
identify
him
by
his
true
japanese
name
beginning
from
there
was
a
continuous
succession
of
persecutions
in
one
hundred
and
thirty
men
women
and
children
were
put
to
death
among
whom
were
two
spanish
priests
and
spinola
an
italian
the
next
year
one
hundred
more
were
put
to
death
the
heroism
of
these
martyrs
awakened
the
greatest
enthusiasm
among
the
christians
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
following
the
execution
many
of
them
crept
to
the
place
where
their
friends
had
been
burnt
and
tenderly
plucked
some
charred
fragments
of
their
bodies
which
they
carried
away
and
cherished
as
precious
relics
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
such
practices
the
officers
directed
that
the
bodies
of
those
burnt
should
be
completely
consumed
and
the
ashes
thrown
into
the
sea
guysbert
in
his
account
mentions
that
among
those
executed
at
hirado
was
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
employ
of
the
dutch
factory
and
his
wife
they
had
two
little
boys
whom
the
factor
offered
to
take
and
have
brought
up
by
the
dutch
but
the
parents
declined
saying
that
they
preferred
to
have
the
boys
die
with
them
a
plan
was
devised
by
which
the
heads
of
households
were
required
to
certify
that
none
of
their
families
were
christians
and
that
no
priests
or
converts
were
harbored
by
them
all
this
terrible
exercise
of
power
and
the
constantly
recurring
scenes
of
suffering
were
more
than
the
governor
could
endure
and
so
we
find
him
at
last
complaining
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
that
his
health
was
impaired
at
his
earnest
petition
he
was
relieved
and
a
new
governor
appointed
in
he
signalized
his
entrance
upon
his
duties
by
condemning
thirteen
christians
to
be
burnt
viz
bishop
franciscus
parquerus
a
portuguese
seventy
years
old
balthazar
de
tores
a
dominican
years
old
together
with
five
portuguese
and
five
japanese
laymen
when
it
came
to
the
crisis
the
five
portuguese
renounced
their
faith
and
escaped
death
on
the
twelfth
of
july
nine
more
were
executed
five
by
burning
and
four
by
beheading
on
the
of
july
a
priest
was
caught
and
executed
who
had
concealed
himself
in
a
camp
of
lepers
and
who
had
hoped
in
that
way
to
escape
detection
the
governor
exerted
himself
to
bring
about
recantations
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
professed
themselves
christians
he
promised
special
favors
to
such
as
would
renounce
their
faith
and
in
many
cases
went
far
beyond
promises
to
secure
the
result
he
set
a
day
when
all
the
apostates
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
should
present
themselves
at
his
office
fifteen
hundred
appeared
on
this
occasion
and
were
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
consideration
but
the
officers
began
to
see
that
putting
christians
to
death
would
not
prevent
others
from
embracing
the
same
doctrine
there
grew
up
such
an
enthusiasm
among
the
faithful
that
they
sought
rather
than
avoided
the
crown
of
martyrdom
as
guysbert
points
out
the
knowledge
of
the
christian
religion
possessed
by
these
converts
must
have
been
exceedingly
small
they
knew
the
lord
s
prayer
and
the
and
a
few
other
prayers
of
the
church
but
they
had
not
the
scriptures
to
read
and
many
of
them
could
not
have
read
them
even
if
they
had
been
translated
into
their
own
language
and
yet
these
humble
and
ignorant
people
withstood
death
and
tortures
far
worse
than
death
with
a
heroism
worthy
of
all
praise
on
the
eighth
of
february
twelve
persons
were
captured
in
a
about
a
mile
from
nagasaki
they
were
first
branded
with
a
hot
iron
on
the
forehead
and
then
on
each
cheek
then
because
they
would
not
recant
they
were
burnt
to
death
subsequently
forty
more
were
captured
among
whom
were
a
father
and
mother
with
their
three
young
children
the
children
were
frightened
at
the
dreadful
preparations
and
would
have
recanted
but
their
parents
refused
to
permit
them
to
take
advantage
of
the
offers
of
clemency
after
the
branding
and
beating
those
who
were
not
yet
driven
to
recant
were
sent
off
to
the
boiling
springs
of
onsen
in
arima
here
they
were
tortured
by
having
the
boiling
water
of
the
springs
poured
upon
them
and
by
being
compelled
to
breathe
the
suffocating
sulphurous
air
which
these
springs
emitted
on
the
fourteenth
of
the
following
may
nine
martyrs
suffered
all
the
torments
which
could
be
contrived
and
finally
were
drowned
august
seventeenth
five
christians
were
burnt
and
eighteen
otherwise
put
to
death
of
whom
one
was
a
franciscan
monk
and
the
rest
were
natives
october
three
japanese
magnates
who
had
joined
hideyori
against
ieyasu
were
discovered
to
be
christians
and
were
shipped
off
to
macao
in
the
following
year
it
is
said
that
three
hundred
and
persons
were
tortured
for
their
faith
including
torture
by
the
boiling
springs
beating
with
clubs
and
burning
it
had
been
reduced
to
such
a
science
that
when
they
saw
a
subject
becoming
weak
and
likely
to
die
they
suspended
their
torments
until
he
revived
whenever
a
priest
was
captured
in
any
household
the
whole
family
by
whom
he
had
been
concealed
were
put
to
death
another
new
governor
was
sent
to
nagasaki
on
the
of
july
he
came
with
the
high
purpose
of
rooting
out
every
vestige
of
christianity
he
set
about
his
work
in
the
most
systematic
manner
nagasaki
it
must
be
understood
is
laid
out
in
streets
which
can
be
closed
up
by
gates
each
street
had
its
head
man
and
every
five
houses
in
each
street
were
under
the
special
charge
of
a
separate
overseer
these
overseers
were
responsible
as
to
what
occurred
and
who
were
concealed
in
each
of
the
houses
under
his
charge
the
gates
were
all
closed
at
night
and
opened
again
in
the
morning
the
governor
went
through
these
streets
house
by
house
and
examined
every
person
in
every
house
if
the
occupants
were
not
christians
or
if
they
renounced
their
christianity
they
were
allowed
to
go
undisturbed
but
if
any
one
persisted
in
the
new
doctrine
he
was
sent
off
to
be
tortured
by
hot
water
at
the
boiling
springs
this
torture
was
now
improved
by
requiring
the
victim
to
have
his
back
slit
open
and
the
boiling
water
poured
directly
on
the
raw
flesh
he
used
the
most
monstrous
means
to
force
the
people
to
renounce
their
faith
he
compelled
naked
women
to
go
through
the
streets
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
many
recanted
rather
than
suffer
such
an
ordeal
other
cases
are
recorded
too
horrible
to
be
related
and
which
only
the
ingenuity
of
hell
could
have
devised
that
any
should
have
persisted
after
such
inhuman
persecutions
seems
to
be
almost
beyond
belief
guysbert
says
that
in
nagasaki
had
forty
thousand
christians
and
in
not
one
was
left
who
acknowledged
himself
a
believer
the
governor
was
proud
that
he
had
virtually
exterminated
christianity
but
the
extermination
had
not
yet
been
attained
the
severity
of
the
measures
adopted
in
nagasaki
had
indeed
driven
many
into
the
surrounding
provinces
so
that
every
place
of
shelter
was
full
they
awaited
in
terror
the
time
when
they
too
should
be
summoned
to
torture
and
death
usually
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
service
of
the
christian
enquiry
was
active
and
diligent
new
refinements
of
cruelty
were
constantly
invented
and
applied
the
last
and
one
of
the
most
effectual
is
denominated
by
the
foreign
historians
of
these
scenes
the
of
the
mathia
tanner
in
his
of
the
martyrs
of
published
in
prague
gives
minute
accounts
of
many
martyrdoms
his
descriptions
are
illustrated
by
sickening
engravings
of
the
tortures
inflicted
among
these
he
gives
one
illustrating
the
suspension
of
a
martyr
in
a
pit
on
the
of
august
the
victim
is
swathed
in
a
covering
which
confines
all
parts
of
the
body
except
one
hand
with
which
he
can
make
the
signal
of
recantation
a
post
is
planted
by
the
side
of
the
pit
with
an
arm
projecting
out
over
it
the
martyr
is
then
drawn
up
by
a
rope
fastened
to
the
feet
and
run
over
the
arm
of
the
post
he
is
then
lowered
into
the
pit
to
a
depth
of
five
or
six
feet
and
there
suffered
to
hang
the
suffering
was
excruciating
blood
exuded
from
the
mouth
and
nose
and
the
sense
of
pressure
on
the
brain
was
fearful
yet
with
all
this
suffering
the
victim
usually
lived
eight
or
nine
days
few
could
endure
this
torture
and
it
proved
a
most
effectual
method
of
bringing
about
recantations
guysbert
says
that
he
had
many
friendly
conversations
with
those
who
had
experienced
the
torture
of
the
they
solemnly
assured
him
that
neither
the
pain
caused
by
burning
with
fire
nor
that
caused
by
any
other
kind
of
torture
deserves
to
be
compared
with
the
agony
produced
in
this
not
being
able
longer
to
endure
the
suffering
they
had
recanted
and
been
set
free
yet
it
is
told
as
a
miraculous
triumph
of
faith
that
a
young
girl
was
submitted
to
this
torture
and
lived
fifteen
days
without
recanting
and
at
last
died
it
is
surely
not
unnatural
that
human
nature
should
succumb
to
such
torments
even
the
well
seasoned
nerves
of
the
jesuit
fathers
were
not
always
able
to
endure
to
the
end
the
enemies
of
the
jesuits
delight
in
narrating
the
apostasy
of
father
christopher
ferreyra
seventy
years
old
a
portuguese
missionary
and
the
provincial
of
the
order
he
was
captured
in
nagasaki
and
was
tortured
by
suspension
in
the
after
five
hours
he
gave
the
signal
of
recantation
and
was
released
he
was
kept
for
some
time
in
prison
and
compelled
to
give
information
concerning
the
members
of
his
order
in
japan
he
was
set
at
liberty
and
forced
to
marry
assuming
the
japanese
dress
and
a
japanese
name
there
was
a
report
set
on
foot
by
the
jesuits
that
in
his
old
age
when
on
his
he
recovered
his
courage
and
declared
himself
a
christian
whereupon
he
was
immediately
carried
off
by
the
japanese
officers
to
the
torture
of
the
where
he
perished
a
penitent
martyr
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
method
of
trial
called
or
trampling
on
the
cross
was
instituted
at
first
pictures
on
paper
were
used
then
slabs
of
wood
were
substituted
as
more
durable
and
finally
in
the
year
an
engraver
of
nagasaki
named
yusa
cast
bronze
plates
from
the
metal
obtained
by
despoiling
the
altars
of
the
churches
these
plates
were
about
five
inches
long
and
four
inches
wide
and
one
inch
thick
and
had
on
them
a
figure
of
christ
on
the
cross
we
take
from
the
french
edition
of
kæmpfer
s
of
an
account
of
what
he
calls
this
detestable
it
was
conducted
by
an
officer
called
the
or
christian
inquisitor
and
began
on
the
second
day
of
the
first
month
in
nagasaki
it
was
commenced
at
two
different
places
at
once
and
was
carried
on
from
house
to
house
until
the
whole
city
was
finished
the
officers
of
each
street
were
required
to
be
present
the
metal
plate
on
which
was
a
figure
of
the
saviour
upon
the
cross
was
laid
upon
the
floor
then
the
head
of
the
house
his
family
and
servants
of
both
sexes
old
and
young
and
any
lodgers
that
might
be
in
the
house
were
called
into
the
room
the
secretary
of
the
inquisitor
thereupon
made
a
list
of
the
household
and
called
upon
them
one
by
one
to
set
their
feet
on
the
plate
even
young
children
not
able
to
walk
were
carried
by
their
mothers
and
made
to
step
on
the
images
with
their
feet
then
the
head
of
the
family
put
his
seal
to
the
list
as
a
certificate
to
be
laid
before
the
governor
that
the
inquisition
had
been
performed
in
his
house
if
any
refused
thus
to
trample
on
the
cross
they
were
at
once
turned
over
to
the
proper
officers
to
be
tortured
as
the
cases
required
this
same
method
of
trial
was
used
in
the
provinces
about
nagasaki
the
governor
lending
to
the
officers
the
plate
which
they
might
use
without
following
the
entire
series
of
events
which
resulted
in
the
extirpation
of
christianity
it
will
be
sufficient
to
give
a
brief
narrative
of
the
closing
act
in
this
fearful
tragedy
it
is
just
however
to
explain
that
the
shimabara
rebellion
was
not
due
to
the
christians
alone
but
that
other
causes
contributed
to
and
perhaps
originated
it
in
view
however
of
the
cruel
persecutions
to
which
the
christians
were
subjected
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
have
been
driven
to
engage
in
such
a
rebellion
as
that
in
arima
the
wonder
rather
is
that
they
were
not
often
and
in
many
places
impelled
to
take
up
arms
against
the
inhumanities
of
their
rulers
the
explanation
of
this
absence
of
resistance
will
be
found
in
the
scattered
condition
of
the
christian
communities
nowhere
unless
it
might
be
in
nagasaki
was
the
number
of
converts
collected
in
one
place
at
all
considerable
they
were
everywhere
overawed
by
the
organized
power
of
the
government
and
the
experience
of
those
who
joined
in
this
arima
insurrection
did
not
encourage
a
repetition
of
its
horrors
the
beginning
of
the
revolt
is
traced
to
the
misgovernment
of
the
daimyō
of
arima
the
original
daimyō
had
been
transferred
by
the
shōgun
to
another
province
and
when
he
removed
from
arima
he
left
nearly
all
his
old
retainers
behind
him
the
newly
instituted
daimyō
on
the
contrary
who
came
to
occupy
the
vacated
province
brought
with
him
a
full
complement
of
his
own
followers
to
make
room
for
these
new
retainers
the
old
ones
were
displaced
placed
from
their
dwellings
and
holdings
and
compelled
to
become
farmers
or
to
take
up
any
other
occupation
which
they
could
find
like
the
of
other
parts
of
japan
who
had
been
unaccustomed
to
any
calling
except
that
of
arms
these
displaced
retainers
proved
very
unsuccessful
farmers
and
were
of
course
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
new
course
of
things
the
daimyō
was
a
cruel
and
inconsiderate
man
who
made
small
account
of
the
hardships
and
complaints
of
the
farmers
the
taxes
were
made
heavier
than
they
could
pay
and
when
they
failed
to
bring
in
the
required
amount
of
rice
he
ordered
them
to
be
dressed
in
straw
which
were
tied
around
their
neck
and
arms
their
hands
were
fastened
behind
their
backs
and
in
this
helpless
condition
the
were
set
on
fire
many
were
fatally
burned
and
some
to
escape
the
burning
threw
themselves
into
the
water
and
were
drowned
this
senseless
cruelty
awakened
an
intense
feeling
of
hatred
against
the
daimyō
and
when
his
son
who
succeeded
him
was
disposed
to
continue
the
same
tyrannical
policy
the
farmers
rose
in
insurrection
against
their
lord
the
peasants
of
the
island
of
amakusa
which
lies
directly
opposite
to
the
province
of
arima
also
joined
in
this
rising
owing
to
their
discontent
against
the
daimyō
of
karatsu
the
christians
who
had
so
long
groaned
under
the
persecutions
of
their
rulers
seized
this
opportunity
to
rise
and
joined
the
farmers
they
declared
that
the
time
had
now
come
for
them
to
avenge
the
innocent
blood
of
christians
and
priests
who
had
perished
throughout
the
empire
the
rising
of
the
christians
began
at
the
village
of
oyei
in
amakusa
october
the
excitement
was
intense
and
in
a
few
days
it
is
said
that
eight
thousand
three
hundred
men
and
one
thousand
women
were
assembled
at
this
village
they
chose
as
their
chief
shirō
tokisada
the
son
of
the
head
man
of
the
village
of
hara
who
proposed
to
march
immediately
upon
nagasaki
and
open
negotiations
with
foreign
nations
and
if
possible
obtain
from
them
the
help
of
troops
he
was
an
enthusiast
and
without
experience
in
war
the
leading
spirit
in
the
insurrection
seems
to
have
been
a
named
ashizuka
who
recommended
that
the
insurgents
should
cross
over
to
shimabara
but
shirō
and
his
enthusiastic
followers
resolved
to
attack
the
castle
of
tomioka
situated
on
the
coast
of
amakusa
they
were
however
unable
to
make
any
impression
upon
it
and
were
obliged
to
withdraw
ashizuka
and
a
few
followers
succeeded
in
breaking
into
the
castle
of
shimabara
and
seizing
the
arms
and
ammunition
and
provisions
which
were
stored
there
the
government
rice
stores
were
seized
both
on
the
mainland
and
on
the
island
of
amakusa
all
the
insurgents
including
men
women
and
children
then
gathered
into
a
deserted
castle
at
hara
which
was
capable
of
holding
to
persons
it
was
supposed
to
be
impregnable
and
was
put
in
order
and
provisioned
for
a
long
siege
the
number
gathered
here
is
estimated
by
the
japanese
writers
at
but
this
number
without
doubt
is
an
exaggeration
the
local
rulers
finding
themselves
unable
to
cope
with
the
rebellion
and
seeing
its
proportions
swelling
every
day
appealed
to
yedo
for
help
the
shōgun
at
this
time
was
iemitsu
the
son
of
the
preceding
shōgun
and
grandson
of
ieyasu
he
possessed
many
of
the
good
qualities
of
his
grandfather
and
is
looked
upon
with
the
exception
of
ieyasu
as
the
greatest
of
the
tokugawa
line
he
had
imbibed
all
the
prejudices
of
his
predecessors
against
foreigners
and
against
the
religion
of
the
foreigners
he
feared
that
this
rebellion
was
begun
at
their
instigation
and
would
be
carried
on
with
their
encouragement
and
help
he
prepared
therefore
for
a
sharp
and
desperate
struggle
which
he
was
determined
should
be
carried
out
to
the
bitter
end
itakura
naizen
was
sent
down
as
and
given
full
powers
under
his
direction
the
siege
of
the
castle
in
which
the
rebels
were
gathered
was
commenced
on
the
of
december
the
daimyōs
of
kyūshū
on
the
demand
of
the
government
sent
additional
troops
so
that
the
besieging
army
amounted
to
men
yet
with
all
this
force
urged
on
by
an
ambition
to
end
this
rebellion
no
serious
effect
had
yet
been
produced
on
the
castle
the
attacks
which
had
been
made
had
produced
no
breach
in
its
walls
we
have
no
information
concerning
the
progress
of
affairs
among
the
inmates
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
part
of
the
rebels
were
farmers
who
were
inured
to
arms
and
who
knew
perfectly
that
neither
consideration
nor
mercy
would
be
shown
them
or
their
families
in
case
the
castle
were
taken
the
remainder
of
the
besieged
force
were
the
christian
insurgents
who
had
been
driven
to
this
rebellion
by
their
cruel
persecution
nothing
could
be
worse
than
what
they
had
already
endured
and
they
had
no
expectation
that
if
they
were
beaten
in
this
contest
any
pity
would
be
shown
to
them
despair
made
the
attitude
of
both
divisions
of
the
rebels
one
of
determined
resistance
and
their
obstinacy
led
the
besiegers
to
put
forth
every
effort

one
step
which
they
took
in
this
matter
led
to
much
discussion
and
to
the
widening
of
the
breach
between
the
dutch
and
the
portuguese
on
the
of
january
the
besiegers
applied
to
the
dutch
at
hirado
for
a
supply
of
gunpowder
which
request
was
complied
with
and
at
the
same
time
an
apology
was
tendered
that
no
larger
quantity
could
be
sent
again
on
the
of
february
a
request
for
cannon
to
be
used
in
the
siege
was
received
and
the
guns
were
sent
koeckebacker
says
we
gave
the
largest
and
most
uniform
guns
in
our
finally
on
the
of
february
koeckebacker
was
asked
to
send
one
of
the
dutch
ships
then
at
hirado
to
the
assistance
of
the
besiegers
the
was
accordingly
sent
and
koeckebacker
himself
accompanied
her
the
guns
which
had
been
first
sent
were
mounted
as
a
land
battery
and
the
guns
of
the
from
her
anchorage
in
the
bay
were
trained
on
the
castle
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
japanese
to
see
cannon
used
in
the
siege
of
a
castle
but
the
effect
was
much
less
than
had
been
expected
no
practicable
breach
was
made
and
the
final
result
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
during
the
fifteen
days
from
the
of
february
to
the
of
march
there
were
thrown
into
the
camp
of
the
enemy
four
hundred
and
cannon
balls
from
the
twenty
guns
of
the
ship
in
the
meantime
the
japanese
officers
began
to
feel
that
it
was
not
a
dignified
proceeding
to
call
upon
a
foreign
nation
to
help
them
to
put
down
a
local
rebellion
even
the
insurgents
had
shot
an
arrow
into
the
imperial
camp
to
which
a
letter
was
attached
deriding
them
for
calling
for
assistance
when
there
were
so
many
courageous
soldiers
in
japan
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
the
dutch
received
notice
on
the
of
march
that
their
ship
was
no
longer
required
and
accordingly
they
returned
to
hirado
the
castle
was
taken
by
assault
on
the
of
april
after
a
siege
which
had
lasted
one
hundred
and
two
days
and
about
seven
months
from
the
breaking
out
of
the
rebellion
by
special
orders
from
yedo
the
insurgents
captured
in
the
castle

the
last

woman
and

to
death
the
father
of

the
young

was
crucified
and
shirō
himself
was
decapitated
and
his
head
exposed
for
seven
days
on
the
great
pier
at
nagasaki
the
daimyō
whose
misgovernment
had
brought
on
this
rebellion
in
amakusa
was
stripped
of
most
of
his
territories
and
he
was
so
intensely
hated
in
what
remained
to
him
that
he
committed
the
daimyō
of
arima
whose
misconduct
and
neglect
had
driven
the
farmers
into
their
fatal
rising
was
also
permitted
to
take
his
own
life
the
help
which
the
dutch
rendered
in
this
siege
exposed
them
to
much
vituperation
naturally
the
jesuit
historians
have
taken
a
very
unfavorable
view
of
the
dutch
share
in
this
sad
transaction
geerts
in
his
defence
of
the
dutch
argues
koeckebacker
did
no
more
than
any
one
else
of
any
nationality
would
probably
have
done
in
the
same
difficult
position
his
endeavor
was
to
preserve
from
decline
or
destruction
the
interests
intrusted
to
him
and
this
was
done
at
the
smallest
possible
price
moreover
the
letters
of
koeckebacker
clearly
show
that
the
japanese
government
did
not
ask
the
aid
of
the
dutch
in
the
persecution
of
christians
as
has
often
been
asserted
by
foreign
authors
who
have
not
taken
the
trouble
to
inform
themselves
thoroughly
on
the
subject
but
they
requested
the
guns
and
the
aid
of
the
dutch
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
subduing
rebellious
subjects
there
could
be
no
valid
reason
for
koeckebacker
to
refuse
the
pressing
request
for
aid
and
consequently
he
agreed
to
give
assistance
as
every
wise
man
would
have
done
in
his
place
koeckebacker
did
not
take
part
in
the
general
massacre
which
followed
on
the
of
april
when
the
fortress
of
the
rebels
was
taken
by
the
imperial
troops
as
he
left
with
his
ship
for
hirado
on
the
of
march
leaving
the
guns
behind
in
arima
had
it
been
in
his
power
to
prevent
such
a
general
massacre
after
the
fortress
had
been
taken
and
the
rebels
were
prisoners
he
would
no
doubt
have
done
this
frightful
termination
to
the
rebellion
followed
as
it
was
by
severe
and
persistent
measures
against
christians
everywhere
was
apparently
the
to
the
church
in
the
empire
no
further
efforts
were
made
either
by
the
daimyōs
of
provinces
or
by
the
heads
of
the
church
to
make
open
headway
against
the
determined
efforts
of
the
government
whatever
was
done
was
in
secret
and
every
means
was
tried
on
the
part
of
those
who
still
clung
to
the
christian
belief
and
especially
of
those
who
were
still
daring
enough
to
try
to
minister
to
them
to
conceal
their
locality
and
their
identity
the
history
of
christianity
in
japan
from
this
time
downward
was
that
of
a
scattered
and
dismembered
remnant
struggling
for
existence
a
long
line
of
edicts
reaching
to
modern
times
was
directed
against
the

persecution
had
interrupted
and
yet
with
all
this
vigilance
and
severity
on
the
part
of
the
government
what
was
the
amazement
of
the
christian
world
to
learn
that
the
old
faith
still
survived
in
the
villages
around
nagasaki
there
were
discovered
in

words
and
symbols
which
had
been
preserved
in
the

have

hereafter
to
refer
to
this
interesting
memento
of
the
christianity
of
the
seventeenth
century
chapter
xii
feudalism
in
japan
ieyasu
was
not
only
a
general
of
eminent
abilities
who
had
from
his
youth
been
accustomed
to
the
responsibility
and
management
of
great
campaigns
but
he
was
a
statesman
who
knew
how
to
secure
the
advantage
to
be
obtained
from
victories
and
conquests
after
the
decisive
battle
of
sekigahara
when
the
control
of
the
empire
became
fixed
in
his
hands
we
hear
little
more
of
him
as
a
general
excepting
in
the
battle
at
ōsaka
when
the
fortunes
of
hideyori
were
finally
and
definitely
settled
the
common
conception
of
ieyasu
is
not
that
of
a
great
commander
like
hideyoshi
but
rather
of
an
organizer
and
who
out
of
confused
and
dismembered
provinces
and
principalities
of
the
empire
constructed
a
firm
and
abiding
state
after
his
settlement
of
the
dissensions
at
home
and
his
admirable
adjustment
of
the
outstanding
difficulties
with
korea
and
china
which
we
have
already
traced
we
shall
find
ieyasu
principally
engaged
in
framing
a
government
which
should
be
suited
to
the
peculiar
wants
and
founded
on
the
historical
antecedents
of
the
country
illustration
ieyasu
there
was
one
characteristic
of
ieyasu
which
has
not
received
sufficient
attention
although
not
a
great
scholar
in
any
sense
even
in
the
age
in
which
he
lived
he
was
more
familiar
than
most
men
of
affairs
of
his
day
with
the
chinese
classical
writings
and
was
in
the
more
leisurely
periods
of
his
life
a
noted
patron
of
learned
men
the
chinese
classics
were
said
to
have
been
brought
to
japan
at
an
early
period
even
before
the
first
introduction
of
buddhism
but
the
period
was
too
early
and
the
condition
of
the
country
too
rude
to
make
the
reading
and
study
of
the
philosophical
and
political
writings
of
confucius
and
mencius
an
essential
part
of
the
education
of
the
people
the
culture
which
buddhism
brought
with
it
accompanied
with
a
knowledge
of
the
writing
and
reading
of
the
chinese
letters
was
all
that
obtained
any
currency
during
the
disturbed
and
warlike
ages
of
japanese
history
but
when
peace
was
at
last
established
by
the
supremacy
of
ieyasu
and
the
active
japanese
intellect
had
some
other
employment
than
fighting
then
learning
took
a
great
start
and
as
the
only
idea
which
the
japanese
possessed
of
learning
was
that
which
prevailed
in
china
and
was
imbedded
in
the
chinese
writings
they
naturally
turned
to
them
for
thought
and
systematic
training
fortunately
ieyasu
was
a
man
who
appreciated
at
its
full
value
the
effect
of
learning
on
the
character
of
his
people
he
caused
the
confucian
classics
to
be
printed
at
a
press
which
he
patronized
in
fushimi
and
this
was
said
to
be
the
first
time
these
works
had
ever
been
printed
in
japan
he
gathered
scholars
about
him
at
fushimi
at
yedo
and
after
his
retirement
at
shizuoka
sumpu
he
favored
education
and
encouraged
the
daimyōs
to
establish
schools
where
the
children
of
their
retainers
could
be
taught
not
only
military
accomplishments
but
the
elements
of
a
good
education
the
chinese
classics
were
made
the
essentials
of
such
an
education
and
the
chief
duty
of
a
school
was
to
teach
the
pupils
to
read
and
write
and
understand
the
works
which
their
venerable
and
learned
neighbor
had
furnished
them
illustration
mixing
ink
for
writing
unfortunately
this
movement
in
behalf
of
learning
was
hampered
by
the
impracticable
nature
of
the
chinese
written
language
instead
of
a
few
characters
representing
sounds
like
european
alphabets
it
consists
of
thousands
of
symbols
each
representing
an
idea
the
pupil
must
therefore
spend
years
in
learning
to
make
and
know
and
read
the
mere
signs
of
language
and
in
the
modern
necessities
of
printing
the
compositor
must
handle
not
less
than
or
chinese
characters
besides
the
japanese
and
other
needful
marks
the
here
mentioned
were
the
result
of
a
promising
effort
which
was
made
to
simplify
the
chinese
written
language
by
expressing
it
in
symbols

the
castle
of
yedo
was
reconstructed
and
enlarged
after
the
battle
of
sekigahara
while
ieyasu
continued
to
reside
at
fushimi
the
jesuit
fathers
who
accompanied
the
father
provincial
on
his
visit
to
ieyasu
assert
that
men
were
employed
in
this
work
very
much
of
the
ground
where
the
present
city
of
tōkyō
now
stands
was
then
according
to
old
maps
covered
with
water
in
excavating
the
moat
which
surrounds
the
castle
and
the
canals
connecting
this
moat
with
the
immense
quantities
of
earth
were
obtained
which
were
used
to
fill
up
lagoons
and
to
reclaim
from
the
shallow
bay
portions
which
have
now
become
solid
land
this
work
of
building
the
castle
and
fitting
the
city
for
the
residence
of
a
great
population
was
carried
on
by
many
of
the
successors
of
ieyasu
the
third
shōgun
iemitsu
the
grandson
of
ieyasu
made
great
improvements
both
to
the
castle
and
the
city
so
that
the
population
and
position
of
yedo
in
no
long
time
placed
it
as
the
chief
city
of
the
empire
the
task
to
which
ieyasu
devoted
himself
during
the
years
of
his
residence
at
yedo
was
that
of
consolidating
and
settling
the
feudal
system
of
the
empire
the
daimyōs
had
for
centuries
been
so
accustomed
to
conduct
themselves
independently
and
to
govern
each
his
own
province
in
his
own
way
that
they
might
be
expected
to
resent
any
efforts
to
restrict
their
action
fortunately
ieyasu
was
a
mild
and
temperate
man
who
while
he
could
act
with
firmness
was
most
considerate
of
the
feelings
and
motives
of
others
after
the
decisive
victory
of
sekigahara
he
readily
and
cordially
made
terms
with
his
enemies
and
did
not
show
himself
rapacious
in
exacting
from
them
undue
penalties
for
their
hostility
to
the
daimyō
of
satsuma
as
we
have
already
seen
he
restored
the
entire
territory
which
taikō
sama
had
given
him
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
was
allowed
to
keep
two
of
the
provinces
out
of
the
ten
which
he
had
acquired
by
conquest
yet
these
two
made
him
still
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
princes
in
the
empire
with
others
he
dealt
in
the
same
liberal
spirit
so
that
out
of
the
old
proud
daimyōs
whom
he
spared
and
permitted
to
continue
in
their
holdings
he
created
for
himself
a
body
of
fast
friends
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
end
ieyasu
had
in
view
was
to
establish
a
system
which
should
continue
loyal
to
his
successors
and
to
a
line
of
successors
who
should
be
of
his
own
family
hence
out
of
the
confiscated
territories
and
out
of
those
which
were
in
part
vacated
as
a
fine
on
the
former
holders
and
out
of
those
which
had
become
vacant
by
natural
causes
he
carved
many
fiefs
with
which
he
endowed
members
of
his
own
family
and
those
retainers
who
were
closely
affiliated
with
him
he
had
twelve
children
nine
sons
and
three
daughters
the
daughters
were
married
to
three
daimyōs
the
oldest
of
his
sons
nobuyasu
had
died
at
an
early
age
his
second
son
hideyasu
had
been
adopted
by
taikō
sama
and
to
him
ieyasu
gave
the
province
of
echizen
as
his
fief
the
third
son
hidetada
who
shared
with
his
father
the
command
of
the
forces
at
the
battle
sekigahara
had
married
a
daughter
of
taikō
sama
and
succeeded
his
father
as
shōgun
on
his
youngest
three
sons
he
bestowed
the
rich
provinces
of
owari
kii
and
mito
and
constituted
the
families
to
which
they
gave
rise
as
the
or
the
three
honorable
families
in
case
of
a
failure
in
the
direct
line
the
heir
to
the
shōgunate
was
to
be
chosen
from
one
of
these
families
without
undertaking
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
the
feudal
system
as
modified
and
established
by
ieyasu
it
will
be
sufficient
to
give
the
classes
of
daimyōs
as
they
continued
to
exist
under
the
tokugawa
shōgunate
it
must
be
understood
that
feudalism
existed
in
japan
before
the
time
of
ieyasu
it
can
be
traced
to
the
period
when
yoritomo
obtained
from
the
emperor
permission
to
send
into
each
province
a
who
should
be
a
military
man
and
should
act
as
protector
of
the
or
governor
who
was
always
a
civilian
appointed
by
the
emperor
these
military
protectors
were
provided
with
troops
for
the
pay
of
whom
yoritomo
got
permission
from
the
emperor
to
levy
a
tax
being
active
men
and
having
troops
under
their
command
they
gradually
absorbed
the
entire
authority
and
probably
in
most
cases
displaced
the
who
only
represented
the
powerless
government
at
kyōto
under
the
disturbed
times
which
followed
the
fall
of
the
house
of
yoritomo
these
became
the
hereditary
military
governors
of
the
provinces
and
usurped
not
only
the
functions
but
the
name
of
they
became
a
class
of
feudal
barons
who
during
the
interval
when
no
central
authority
controlled
them
governed
each
one
his
own
province
on
his
own
responsibility
even
after
the
establishment
of
a
central
authority
and
continuously
down
to
the
abolition
of
feudalism
the
government
of
the
people
was
in
the
hands
of
the
daimyō
of
each
province
the
assessment
of
taxes
the
construction
of
roads
and
bridges
the
maintenance
of
education
the
punishment
of
crime
the
collection
of
debts
the
enforcement
of
contracts
and
indeed
the
whole
circle
of
what
was
denominated
law
were
in
the
hands
of
the
local
government
in
truth
in
japan
as
in
other
feudal
countries
there
was
scarcely
such
a
thing
as
law
in
existence
the
customs
that
prevailed
the
decisions
of
a
magistrate
the
final
determinations
of
the
daimyō
were
authoritative
in
every
community
and
in
all
these
each
province
was
in
a
great
degree
a
law
unto
itself
the
classes
of
daimyōs
as
arranged
and
established
by
ieyasu
were
not
altered
by
his
successors
although
the
number
included
under
each
class
was
liable
to
minor
changes
before
ieyasu
s
time
there
were
three
classes
of
daimyōs
viz
eighteen
who
may
be
termed
lords
of
provinces
or
lords
of
smaller
districts
and
two
hundred
and
twelve
or
lords
of
castles
that
is
two
hundred
and
in
all
the
distinction
between
the
first
two
was
one
of
rank
but
the
third
differed
from
the
others
in
the
fact
that
the
assessment
in
each
case
was
less
than
of
rice
the
number
of
daimiates
was
increased
by
the
addition
of
kii
and
owari
to
which
ieyasu
appointed
two
of
his
sons
as
daimyōs
a
third
son
he
appointed
daimyō
of
mito
which
was
already
of
the
rank
he
vacated
this
place
by
compelling
the
previous
holder
to
accept
in
place
of
it
another
daimiate
of
equivalent
value
ieyasu
divided
all
daimyōs
into
two
distinct
classes
the
and
the
the
term
was
used
to
designate
those
who
were
considered
the
vassals
of
the
tokugawa
family
the
daimyōs
were
those
who
were
considered
as
equal
to
the
vassals
of
the
tokugawa
family
but
who
were
not
in
fact
vassals
of
the
former
there
were
originally
one
hundred
and
and
of
the
latter
of
the
daimyōs
were
relatives
of
the
shōgun
s
family
of
whom
three
as
has
been
stated
were
the

the

five
leading
daimyōs
were
kaga
sendai
aizu
chōshū
and
satsuma
and
although
they
ranked
after
the
they
had
some
superior
advantages
they
were
classed
as
or
guests
and
whenever
they
paid
a
visit
to
the
capital
of
the
shōgun
they
were
met
by
envoys
and
conducted
to
their
residences
besides
these
daimyōs
of
different
classes
ieyasu
established
an
inferior
kind
of
feudal
nobility
which
was
termed
this
means
literally
the
they
had
small
holdings
assigned
to
them
and
their
income
varied
very
greatly

the

at
about
it
was
the
custom
to
employ
the
members
of
this
minor
class
of
aristocracy
very
largely
in
filling
the
official
positions
in
the
shōgun
s
government
indeed
it
was
held
as
a
common
maxim
that
the
offices
should
be
filled
by
poor
men
rather
than
by

were

the
ordinary

were
the
retainers
of
the
daimyōs

of

were
the
descendants
of
the
soldiers
of
the
time
of
yoritomo
who
appointed
to
reside
with
a
company
of
troops
in
each
province
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
peace
they
had
already
grown
to
claim
a
great
superiority
over
the
common
people
and
ieyasu
encouraged
them
in
this
feeling
of
superciliousness
the
people
were
divided
into
four
classes
arranged
in
the
following
order
farmers
artisans
and
merchants
and
in
his
ieyasu
thus
expresses
himself
the

of

four
classes

to
use
all
the
privileges
which
were
allowed
them
by

testamentary
law
especially
in
the
large
cities
where
great
numbers

practices

made
them
an
intolerable
nuisance
nevertheless
it
must
be
allowed
that
nearly
all
that
was
good
and
and
scholarly
in
japan
was
to
be
found
among
the
ranks
of
the
feudal
retainers
it
is
to
them
that
the
credit
must
be
given
of
the
great
changes
and
improvements
which
have
been
initiated
since
japan
was
opened

went
out
into

what
western
science
had
to
teach

they
have
been
pioneers
in
a
return
to
a
central

to
the
experiment

but
surely
all
its
modern
development
in

and

is
to
be
traced
to
the
adaptability

through

going

by

the

religious

says

alike
may
follow

have
ever

determinedly
be
put

he
was
therefore
tolerant
towards
all
the
different
sects
of
buddhism
and
towards
the
old

how
ieyasu

visited

it
under

of
you
to

make
this

of
ieyasu
the
jōdo
was
the
authorized
sect
to
which
the
court
of

was

attached

to
this
is
to
be
attributed
the
fact
that
its
temples

monasteries
in
tōkyō
have
always
been
of
the
most
majestic
and

character
ieyasu

not
long
hold
the
office
of
shōgun
which
the
emperor
had
conferred
upon
him
in
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
why
a
man
who
was
only
years
of
age
and
who
was
still
in
vigorous
health
should
wish
to
throw
off
the
responsibilities
of
office
and
retire
to
private
life
we
must
remember
however
that
it
was
the
custom
of
his
country
consecrated
by
the
usage
of
the
imperial
house
and
of
the
shōguns
and
regents
who
had
preceded
him
morever
though
he
surrendered
to
his
son
the
title
of
shōgun
he
retained
in
his
own
hands
a
large
part
of
the
power
which
he
had
hitherto
exercised
it
may
be
supposed
that
he
was
anxious
to
establish
the
succession
of
the
shōgunate
unquestionably
in
his
own
family
for
this
purpose
he
deemed
it
wise
to
initiate
a
successor
while
he
still
had
the
influence
and
the
power
to
compel
the
acquiescence
of
the
feudal
lords
of
the
empire
acting
upon
these
considerations
ieyasu

was
situated
on

one
hundred

fourteen
miles
from
the
shōgun
s
capital
here
he
maintained
a
court
and
practically
in
all
important
matters
governed
the
country
he
was
free
however
from
the
petty
details
of
the
administration
and
devoted
himself
as
an
amateur
to
a
literary
life
to
the
collection
and
printing
of
books
and
to
the
encouragement
and
patronage
of
literary
men
in
which
he
delighted
in
the
meantime
important
events
had
been
taking
place
which
had

history
of

the
spanish
on
the
one
hand
and

dutch
and

on
the
other
was
not
confined
to
the
atlantic
but
broke
out
in
the
pacific
where
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
had
so
long
been
predominant
a
preliminary
to
the
opening
of
trade
with
the
dutch
were
the
arrival
of
william
adams
and
his
extraordinary
experiences
in
japan
as
we
learn
from
his
own
letters
he
was
born
near
rochester
in
england
and
when
twelve
years
old
was
apprenticed
to
nicholas
diggins
as
a
pilot
with
him
he
served
for
twelve
years
then
took
service
as
pilot
major
of
a
fleet
of
five
sail
which
was
about
to
be
despatched
by
the
indish
companie
to
take
part
in
the
trade
of
the
east
indies
this
fleet
had
a
rough
time
and
with
fevers
and
scurvy
and
want
of
food
a
great
part
of
the
crews
of
the
five
vessels
died
they
sailed
by
the
way
of
the
straits
of
magellan
then
northward
past
chili
and
westward
across
the
broad
pacific
two
of
the
ships
turned
back
at
the
straits
and
returned
to
holland
a
third
vessel
was
captured
by
the
spaniards
and
the
pinnace
of
a
fourth
was
seized
by
eight
men
and
run
into
some
island
on
their
way
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
sandwich
islands
and
there
wrecked
and
the
eight
men
probably
eaten
the
two
vessels
still
remaining
were
the
and
the
the
former
of
these
was
never
more
heard
of
the
sole
remaining
vessel
was
the
of
which
jaques
maihore
was
the
master
and
william
adams
was
the
pilot
sickness
especially
the
scurvy
which
was
the
frightful
scourge
on
board
the
vessels
of
that
day
had
reduced
the
crew
so
that
only
four
were
able
to
walk
of
whom
adams
was
one
and
four
more
could
creep
on
their
knees
in
this
condition
they
reached
on
the
eleventh
of
april
the
northeastern
coast
of
the
island
of
kyūshū
landing
in
the
province
of
bungo
whose
prince
in
earlier
days
had
been
the
friend
and
patron
of
the
portuguese
jesuits
they
were
kindly
received
the
governor
of
the
district
furnishing
a
guard
to
protect
their
late
however
for
the
preservation
of
much
of
a
house
in
which
the
sick
could
be
cared
for
in
a
few
days
a
portuguese
jesuit
and
other
portuguese
arrived
from
nagasaki
through
whom
the
dutch
could
communicate
with
the
natives
the
national
and
religious
animosity
between
the
strangers
and
their
interpreters
could
not
fail
however
to
manifest
itself
the
portuguese
tried
to
create
the
impression
that
the
refugees
were
pirates
and
unworthy
of
protection
and
help
in
accordance
with
the
usual
custom
word
was
immediately
sent
to
ieyasu
whom
adams
calls
the
emperor
who
at
this
time
was
at
the
castle
of
ōsaka
he
sent
boats
to
bungo
by
which
adams
and
one
of
the
crew
were
conveyed
to
his
castle
adams
gives
an
interesting
account
of
his
reception
of
the
questions
asked
concerning
his
country
and
its
relations
to
the
spanish
and
portuguese
he
took
occasion
to
explain
that
the
object
of
the
dutch
in
entering
the
east
was
purely
that
of
trade
that
they
had
in
their
own
country
many
commodities
which
they
would
be
glad
to
exchange
for
the
products
of
the
eastern
nations
after
this
interview
adams
was
kept
days
in
prison
expecting
to
suffer
the
punishment
of
crucifixion
which
he
understood
was
the
common
mode
of
disposing
of
such
characters
he
found
afterwards
that
the
portuguese
had
been
using
means
to
poison
the
mind
of
ieyasu
by
representing
them
as
dangerous
characters
and
recommending
that
all
the
refugees
should
be
put
to
death
as
a
warning
to
others
but
he
tells
us
that
ieyasu
answered
them
that
we
as
yet
had
done
to
him
nor
to
none
of
his
lands
any
harm
or
dammage
and
it
was
against
reason
and
justice
to
put
us
to
death
if
our
countreys
had
warres
the
one
with
the
other
that
was
no
cause
that
he
should
put
us
to
while
adams
was
thus
kept
in
prison
the
had
been
brought
to
sakai
near
to
ōsaka
finally
he
was
set
at
liberty
and
suffered
to
revisit
his
ship
where
he
found
the
captain
and
remnant
of
the
crew
the
goods
and
clothing
on
board
had
been
stolen
by
the
natives
which
ieyasu
tried
to
recover
for
them
but
everything
had
been
so
scattered
that
it
was
impossible
to
regain
it
savinge
rs
in

money
was
commanded
to
be
geven
us
as
compensation
after
this
settlement
they
were
ordered
to
sail
with
their
ship
to
the
land
of
quanto
and
neere
to
the
citie
eddo
whither
ieyasu
was
about
to
proceed
by
land
here
they
had
a
mutiny
among
their
men
which
ended
in
the
entire
disbanding
of
the
crew
and
the
dividing
up
among
them
the
money
which
they
had
received
for
their
goods
each
man
was
left
to
shift
for
himself
the
captain
got
permission
to
sail
in
a
japanese
junk
to
patan
where
he
hoped
to
meet
dutch
vessels
adams
himself
was
kept
about
the
shōgun
s
court
and
was
made
useful
in
various
ways
his
first
achievement
was
to
build
a
vessel
of
about
eighteen
tons
burthen
which
gained
him
great
favor
in
which
he
made
several
short
voyages
then
in
by
command
of
the
shōgun
he
built
another
ship
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
tons
burthen
which
also
was
a
successful
venture
for
it
so
happened
that
the
governor
of
manila
was
on
his
way
to
nova
spania
in
a
large
ship
of
one
thousand
tons
burthen
and
was
wrecked
on
the
east
coast
of
japan
in
the
province
of
shimosa
the
governor
and
those
of
his
comrades
who
were
saved
from
the
shipwreck
were
sent
on
to
acapulco
in
the
ship
which
adams
had
just
built
in
the
year
following
the
governor
in
recognition
of
their
kindness
to
him
sent
back
to
the
japanese
government
a
much
larger
vessel
as
a
present
the
original
being
sent
to
and
retained
at
manila
adams
was
a
straightforward
honest
fellow
and
commended
himself
to
ieyasu
by
usefulness
not
only
in
such
matters
as
building
ships
but
in
furnishing
information
concerning
foreign
affairs
which
at
this
time
were
pressing
on
the
government
in
order
to
render
him
more
content
ieyasu
gave
him
a
small
holding
at
hemi
near
the
present
town
of
yokosuka
a
few
hours
sail
from
yedo
he
himself
speaks
of
this
property
as
a
living
like
unto
a
lordship
in
england
with
eighty
or
ninety
husbandmen
that
be
as
my
slaves
or
he
probably
also
had
a
residence
in
yedo
for
there
is
to
this
day
a
street
called
or
pilot
street
near
nihonbashi
which
is
popularly
believed
to
have
been
the
street
in
which
adams
lived
he
himself
says
that
he
was
known
among
the
japanese
as
sama
or
mr
pilot
to
console
himself
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
and
children
left
in
england
he
married
a
japanese
wife
who
with
several
children
is
mentioned
by
captain
cocks
in
the
visit
above
referred
to
notwithstanding
his
frequent
endeavors
to
get
back
to
england
he
was
never
able
to
return
but
after
much
important
service
both
to
the
dutch
and
english
to
which
we
shall
refer
below
he
died
may
the
first
appearance
of
the
dutch
after
adams
shipwreck
as
above
described
was
in
when
the
and
the
yacht
arrived
at
hirado
they
were
well
received
by
the
daimyō
and
a
deputation
was
sent
to
yedo
to
visit
the
shōgun
adams
in
his
second
letter
speaks
of
their
being
received
in
great
friendship
making
conditions
with
the
emperor
shōgun
yearly
to
send
a
ship
or
they
were
given
a
letter
addressed
to
the
king
of
holland
with
which
they
went
back
arriving
home
july
this
letter
among
other
things
promises
that
they
your
subjects
in
all
places
countries
and
islands
under
mine
obedience
may
traffic
and
build
homes
serviceable
and
needful
for
their
trade
and
merchandises
where
they
may
trade
without
any
hindrance
at
their
pleasure
as
well
in
time
to
come
as
for
the
present
so
that
no
man
shall
do
them
any
wrong
and
i
will
maintain
and
defend
them
as
mine
own
in
accordance
with
this
agreement
the
first
vessel
to
arrive
was
a
small
yacht
in
july
a
deputation
from
this
vessel
also
went
to
visit
the
shōgun
and
the
retired
shōgun
it
so
chanced
that
a
portuguese
party
had
preceded
them
by
a
few
days
these
deputations
met
at
the
court
of
ieyasu
by
the
assistance
of
adams
who
was
ready
to
do
a
favor
to
his
old
friends
the
dutch
were
kindly
welcomed
by
the
s
court
and
in
spite
of
the
hostility
or
perhaps
aided
by
the
hostility
of
the
portuguese
they
received
from
him
a
patent
for
continued
trade
as
given
in
kaempfer
in
translation
it
is
as
follows
all
dutch
ships
that
come
into
my
empire
of
japan
whatever
place
or
port
they
may
put
into
we
do
hereby
expressly
command
all
and
every
one
of
our
subjects
not
to
molest
the
same
in
any
way
nor
to
be
a
hindrance
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
to
show
them
all
manner
of
help
favor
and
assistance
every
one
shall
beware
to
maintain
the
friendship
in
assurance
of
which
we
have
been
pleased
to
give
our
imperial
word
to
these
people
and
every
one
shall
take
care
that
our
commands
and
promises
be
inviolably
kept
dated
in
japanese
equivalent
to
august
this
was
the
authority
on
which
the
dutch
trade
in
japan
began
and
under
which
with
many
changes
and
vicissitudes
it
continued
to
the
time
when
the
country
was
opened
by
treaty
to
foreign
nations
the
effort
made
by
english
merchants
to
open
a
trade
with
the
japanese
was
made
only
a
little
after
this
time
indeed
it
is
said
that
the
report
brought
back
by
the
dutch
in
the
concerning
adams
presence
and
influence
in
japan
gave
the
impulse
which
started
an
expedition
under
captain
john
saris
in
january
saris
was
an
old
adventurer
in
the
east
and
therefore
fitted
to
encounter
the
varied
experiences
of
his
proposed
trip
he
carried
a
letter
from
james
then
king
of
england
to
ieyasu
the
retired
shōgun
at
bantam
on
his
way
he
found
that
adams
first
letter
contained
in
the
collection
of
his
letters
and
dated
october
had
just
been
received
by
the
english
merchants
it
encouraged
saris
to
push
on
in
his
expedition
he
arrived
at
hirado
june
where
the
daimyō
welcomed
him
and
immediately
sent
off
a
special
messenger
to
the
shōgun
s
court
to
summon
adams
to
their
aid
he
came
at
once
and
by
his
advice
captain
saris
with
a
party
set
out
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
retired
shōgun
he
gives
an
interesting
account
of
this
journey
and
visit
which
resulted
in
a
charter
of
privileges
for
the
london
east
india
company
to
trade
in
any
port
of
the
empire
having
arranged
to
his
great
satisfaction
this
important
matter
he
returned
to
hirado
where
he
established
a
factory
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
future
english
trade
in
this
however
he
encountered
no
little
opposition
from
the
dutch
traders
who
had
a
factory
in
the
same
place
for
while
these
enterprising
nations
who
had
been
allies
in
the
days
of
the
armada
could
combine
very
readily
in
opposition
to
the
spanish
and
portuguese
it
was
not
easy
for
either
of
them
to
look
on
complacently
while
the
other
secured
for
itself
superior
advantages
in
the
matter
of
trade
captain
saris
tried
to
come
to
some
agreement
with
his
rivals
so
that
the
prices
of
commodities
might
be
kept
up
but
he
was
compelled
to
see
the
dutch
factory
in
order
to
crowd
him
out
of
the
field
putting
the
goods
which
they
had
for
sale
at
prices
which
were
ruinous
to
both
having
established
matters
however
on
as
satisfactory
a
footing
as
he
could
arrange
and
having
left
his
comrade
captain
cocks
in
charge
of
the
english
factory
he
sailed
for
home
the
subsequent
events
in
the
history
of
english
trade
with
japan
may
as
well
be
traced
here
the
relations
of
the
english
and
dutch
in
the
east
grew
steadily
more
inimical
perhaps
this
was
due
to
the
increasing
rivalry
in
trade
and
navigation
which
prevailed
between
them
at
home
in
the
london
east
india
company
fitted
out
an
expedition
of
five
large
vessels
this
fleet
arrived
in
the
east
in
the
summer
of
the
following
year
after
much
hostile
skirmishing
in
which
the
dutch
obtained
the
permanent
advantage
and
the
english
commander
was
about
to
retire
word
was
brought
to
them
from
europe
that
a
peace
had
been
arranged
between
the
two
countries
the
english
and
dutch
vessels
accordingly
sailed
to
japan
where
they
took
a
hand
at
trade
because
in
those
days
ships
always
were
sent
to
the
east
prepared
either
to
fight
or
trade
as
the
case
required
but
this
amicable
arrangement
did
not
last
many
years
the
massacre
at
the
spice
islands
in
for
which
cromwell
afterward
exacted
an
indemnity
ended
all
attempts
at
in
the
east
soon
after
this
the
english
company
withdrew
entirely
from
the
japanese
trade
having
lost
in
the
effort
forty
thousand
pounds
the
dutch
were
thus
left
without
a
rival
and
we
shall
see
on
what
conditions
and
at
what
sacrifices
they
continued
to
maintain
their
monopoly
during
the
period
of
ieyasu
s
retirement
which
lasted
from
until
his
death
in
he
devoted
himself
as
we
have
seen
to
the
consolidation
of
his
family
dynasty
and
to
such
literary
occupations
as
his
leisure
allowed
he
was
a
patron
of
the
art
derived
from
korea
which
then
was
popular
in
japan
of
printing
with
movable
types
this
art
fell
into
disuse
afterwards
but
during
ieyasu
s
retirement
in
sumpu
he
interested
himself
in
printing
with
blocks
as
well
as
by
the
new
method
when
he
died
he
was
engaged
in
seeing
through
the
press
an
edition
of
an
important
chinese
work
he
left
behind
him
a
document
called
the
of
which
to
those
desirous
of
studying
the
character
and
motives
of
the
founder
of
the
tokugawa
dynasty
possesses
a
supreme
interest
some
doubt
has
been
thrown
by
japanese
critics
on
the
authenticity
of
this
composition
it
has
been
asserted
that
it
was
not
the
work
of
ieyasu
and
therefore
not
worthy
of
the
reverence
in
which
it
has
been
held
but
whether
the
was
originally
composed
by
him
or
approved
and
sanctioned
by
him
matters
little
for
our
purpose
it
dates
from
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
tokugawa
shōgunate
and
has
been
an
unimpeachable
authority
during
all
its
history
one
of
the
singular
features
in
the
disposition
of
the
to
which
professor
grigsby
directs
attention
was
the
secrecy
in
which
it
was
kept
the
original
was
preserved
in
kyōto
and
was
never
seen
while
an
authenticated
copy
was
kept
at
the
shōgun
s
court
in
yedo
and
once
a
year
was
open
to
the
inspection
of
all
above
a
certain
rank
to
us
it
seems
unaccountable
that
a
body
of
laws
by
which
the
conduct
of
men
was
to
be
guided
should
be
kept
secret
from
them
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
there
were
no
such
things
as
laws
in
the
sense
we
now
understand
the
term
there
were
magistrates
who
heard
causes
and
complaints
but
their
decisions
were
based
not
on
laws
which
had
been
enacted
by
the
government
but
upon
prevailing
custom
and
upon
the
innate
sense
of
justice
which
was
assumed
to
be
present
in
the
mind
of
every
man
whatever
laws
or
rules
therefore
were
in
existence
were
not
for
the
information
of
the
people
but
for
the
guidance
of
the
magistrates
the
of
consists
of
one
hundred
chapters
arranged
without
any
attempt
at
logical
order
each
chapter
treats
of
a
single
separate
subject
and
is
usually
of
a
very
moderate
length
as
professor
grigsby
has
pointed
out
sixteen
chapters
consist
of
moral
maxims
and
reflections
are
connected
with
politics
and
administrations
refer
to
legal
matters
and
in
seven
ieyasu
relates
episodes
of
his
own
personal
the
moral
maxims
are
quoted
chiefly
from
the
works
of
the
chinese
sages
confucius
and
mencius
while
the
collection
on
the
whole
has
a
military
aspect
and
plainly
encourages
and
promotes
the
of
a
military
class
yet
we
see
in
it
the
mild
and
peaceful
nature
of
ieyasu
the
fifteenth
chapter
says
in
my
youth
my
sole
aim
was
to
conquer
and
subjugate
inimical
provinces
and
to
take
revenge
on
the
enemies
of
my
ancestors
yuyō
teaches
however
that
to
assist
the
people
is
to
give
peace
to
the
empire
and
since
i
have
come
to
understand
that
the
precept
is
founded
on
sound
principle
i
have
undeviatingly
followed
it
let
my
posterity
hold
fast
this
principle
any
one
turning
his
back
upon
it
is
no
descendant
of
mine
the
people
are
the
foundation
of
the
his
estimate
of
the
social
relations
is
given
in
the
chapter
in
which
he
says
the
married
state
is
the
great
relation
of
mankind
one
should
not
live
alone
after
sixteen
years
of
age
but
should
procure
a
mediator
and
perform
the
ceremony
of
matrimonial
alliance
the
same
kindred
however
may
not
intermarry
a
family
of
good
descent
should
be
chosen
to
marry
into
for
when
a
line
of
descendants
is
prolonged
the
foreheads
of
ancestors
expand
all
mankind
recognize
marriage
as
the
first
law
of
the
old
custom
of
servants
and
retainers
following
their
masters
to
death
and
committing
suicide
in
order
to
accompany
them
is
referred
to
in
the
chapter
it
is
not
improbable
that
some
exhibition
of
this
custom
occasionally
was
seen
in
the
days
of
ieyasu
for
he
very
sternly
condemns
it
thus
although
it
is
undoubtedly
an
ancient
custom
for
a
vassal
to
follow
his
lord
to
death
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
in
the
practice
these
practices
are
strictly
forbidden
more
especially
to
primary
retainers
and
also
to
secondary
retainers
even
to
the
lowest
he
is
the
opposite
of
a
faithful
servant
who
disregards
this
prohibition
his
posterity
shall
be
impoverished
by
the
confiscation
of
his
property
as
a
warning
to
those
who
disobey
the
it
is
not
necessary
to
follow
in
detail
the
line
of
tokugawa
shōguns
few
of
them
impressed
themselves
in
any
marked
manner
on
the
history
of
their
country
iemitsu
the
third
shōgun
who
was
a
grandson
of
ieyasu
was
a
man
of
great
ability
and
left
many
marks
of
his
talents
upon
the
empire
under
his
administration
the
capital
made
great
advances
he
bound
the
daimyōs
to
his
house
by
requiring
them
to
maintain
residences
in
yedo
under
the
surveillance
of
the
government
his
mausoleum
is
placed
with
that
of
his
grandfather
amid
the
august
glories
of
nikkō
tsunayoshi
during
his
incumbency
was
more
than
usually
interested
in
the
peaceful
prosperity
of
his
country
and
is
gratefully
remembered
for
his
patronage
of
education
and
letters
but
on
the
whole
they
were
content
to
fill
the
office
of
shōgun
in
a
perfunctory
manner
and
to
leave
to
subordinates
the
duty
of
governing
japan
reached
the
acme
of
her
ancient
greatness
during
the
tokugawa
dynasty
the
arts
which
have
given
her
such
a
deservedly
high
rank
attained
their
greatest
perfection
keramics
and
lacquer
which
are
her
most
exquisite
arts
achieved
a
degree
of
excellence
to
which
we
can
now
only
look
back
with
hopeless
admiration
as
shown
in
the
manufacture
of
bronze
and
in
the
forging
and
mounting
of
swords
was
scarcely
less
notable
the
still
higher
art
of
painting
which
came
to
japan
from
china
rose
during
the
tokugawa
period
to
the
rank
which
it
still
holds
in
the
estimation
of
the
artistic
world
the
best
evidence
however
of
the
civilization
of
a
people
is
found
in
their
social
condition
to
learn
the
true
culture
of
a
nation
it
is
necessary
to
study
their
education
and
literature
their
laws
and
system
of
government
and
their
morals
and
religion
in
some
of
these
particulars
it
is
still
difficult
to
obtain
an
adequate
knowledge
of
japan
but
gradually
they
are
being
revealed
to
us
the
laws
and
legal
precedents
which
prevailed
during
the
tokugawa
period
have
been
unearthed
from
the
archives
of
the
department
of
justice
and
are
being
published
in
the
of
the
asiatic
the
medical
and
scientific
advancement
of
japan
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
was
not
with
her
progress
in
the
arts
they
were
hampered
with
the
old
chinese
notions
about
a
male
principle
and
a
female
principle
which
were
conceived
to
prevail
in
nature
and
with
the
five
elements
to
which
the
human
organs
were
supposed
to
correspond
fortunately
nature
has
ways
of
healing
diseases
in
spite
of
theories
and
drugs
to
this
benign
principle
must
be
assigned
the
fact
that
the
human
race
has
survived
the
surgery
and
medicaments
of
mediæval
europe
as
well
as
mediæval
china
and
japan
in
one
particular
the
medical
art
of
japan
seems
to
have
been
differently
perhaps
better
conducted
than
in
europe
it
is
narrated
by
the
japanese
annalists
that
if
a
physican
made
a
mistake
in
his
prescription
or
in
his
directions
for
taking
the
medicine
he
was
punished
by
three
years
imprisonment
and
a
heavy
fine
and
if
there
should
be
any
impurity
in
the
medicine
prescribed
or
any
mistake
in
the
preparation
sixty
lashes
were
inflicted
besides
a
heavy
fine
illustration
oban
gold
coin
three
peculiar
modes
of
medical
practice
deserve
notice
the
first
was
acupuncture
which
consisted
in
inserting
a
thin
needle
through
the
skin
into
the
muscles
beneath
a
second
was
the
cauterization
by
japanese
this
was
effected
by
placing
over
the
spot
a
small
conical
wad
of
the
fibrous
blossoms
of
mugwort
vulgaris
the
cone
was
kindled
at
the
top
and
slowly
burned
till
it
was
consumed
a
painful
blister
was
produced
on
the
spot
which
was
believed
to
have
a
wholesome
effect
in
the
case
of
many
complaints
a
third
mode
of
treatment
is
the
practice
of
which
western
nations
have
borrowed
and
which
in
japan
it
has
long
been
the
exclusive
privilege
of
the
blind
to
apply
illustration
cauterizing
with
moxa
many
of
the
improved
notions
of
western
medicine
were
introduced
by
the
dutch
and
this
accounts
for
the
unprecedentedly
rapid
advance
which
this
science
has
made
since
the
opening
of
the
country
chapter
xiii
commodore
perry
and
what
followed
the
most
potent
cause
which
led
to
the
breaking
down
of
the
tokugawa
shōgunate
was
the
attitude
which
the
empire
had
assumed
toward
foreign
nations
there
were
other
causes
which
with
this
but
none
which
were
capable
of
such
and
revolutionary
effects
we
have
seen
that
this
attitude
was
due
to
the
fears
entertained
concerning
the
designs
of
the
portuguese
and
the
spanish
these
fears
may
have
been
unfounded
but
they
were
none
the
less
real
and
operative
such
fears
may
have
been
stimulated
by
the
dutch
who
had
no
reason
to
deal
tenderly
with
the
fanatical
enemies
of
the
independence
and
religion
of
their
country
the
spirit
of
trade
with
large
profits
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
enterprises
which
were
sent
out
from
europe
to
the
east
and
west
indies
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
rivalry
between
the
dutch
and
portuguese
resulted
in
the
banishment
of
the
latter
and
the
establishment
of
the
dutch
at
nagasaki
in
they
occupied
the
little
artificial
island
of
deshima
about
three
acres
in
extent
where
were
erected
their
houses
their
offices
and
stores
and
where
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
their
trade
was
conducted
and
this
together
with
a
like
limited
arrangement
with
the
chinese
was
the
sole
foreign
intercourse
allowed
with
japan
it
is
plain
now
that
this
seclusion
was
a
great
mistake
it
would
have
been
of
inestimable
value
to
this
enterprising
and
progressive
people
to
have
kept
in
the
race
for
improvement
with
the
other
nations
of
the
world
they
would
not
at
this
late
day
be
compelled
under
a
dreadful
strain
of
resources
to
provide
themselves
with
the
modern
appliances
of
civilization
long
since
they
would
have
tried
the
experiments
with
which
they
are
now
engaged
and
would
have
found
a
way
through
the
intricacies
of
politics
to
a
free
and
stable
government
to
ieyasu
and
his
successors
the
way
of
safety
seemed
to
be
to
shut
themselves
up
and
sternly
deny
admittance
to
the
outside
world
while
they
continued
to
work
out
their
destiny
in
their
own
way
with
whatever
shortcomings
the
dutch
are
to
be
charged
in
their
intercourse
with
japan
the
world
owes
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
them
for
what
they
accomplished
whatever
was
known
concerning
japanese
history
and
civilization
down
to
the
times
of
commodore
perry
came
chiefly
from
the
dutch
and
not
less
than
the
debt
of
the
rest
of
the
world
is
that
of
japan
herself
although
the
influence
of
the
government
was
always
exerted
against
the
admission
of
foreign
ideas
not
a
few
of
the
seeds
of
western
civilization
were
by
them
planted
in
a
fertile
soil
and
bore
abundant
fruit
to
kaempfer
and
baron
von
siebold
particularly
we
must
always
look
for
our
knowledge
of
the
japan
of
the
days
of
its
seclusion
many
efforts
were
made
at
successive
times
to
open
intercourse
by
the
representatives
of
different
nations
the
russians
were
the
most
persistent
and
their
attempts
did
not
cease
until
the
imprisonment
of
captain
galowin
in
in
comparatively
recent
times
numerous
essays
were
made
resulting
in
disappointment
the
american
brig
in
the
british
surveying
ship
in
captain
cooper
in
commodore
biddle
in
admiral
cecille
in
commander
glynn
in
and
commander
matheson
in
the
same
year
all
made
efforts
to
communicate
with
the
government
but
were
rebuffed
it
is
plain
that
affairs
were
rapidly
verging
towards
a
point
when
the
isolation
of
japan
must
be
given
up
several
causes
contributed
to
the
creation
of
a
special
interest
in
the
united
states
of
america
concerning
the
opening
of
negotiations
with
japan
one
of
these
was
the
magnitude
to
which
the
whale
fishery
had
attained
and
the
large
financial
investments
held
in
this
industry
by
american
citizens
a
second
cause
was
the
opening
of
china
to
foreign
trade
as
a
result
of
the
opium
war
but
the
most
active
cause
was
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
in
and
the
consequent
development
of
that
state
as
a
centre
of
trade
it
was
an
early
scheme
to
run
a
line
of
steamers
from
san
francisco
to
the
newly
opened
ports
of
china
to
hongkong
the
distance
is
about
nautical
miles
and
if
a
steamer
is
to
traverse
the
whole
distance
without
a
break
she
must
carry
an
enormous
load
of
coal
the
only
remedy
lay
in
establishing
a
coaling
station
on
the
japanese
islands
and
this
could
only
be
effected
when
japan
abandoned
her
policy
of
seclusion
and
entered
with
a
free
heart
into
the
comity
of
nations
the
interest
of
the
government
and
people
of
the
united
states
at
last
eventuated
in
the
expedition
under
commodore
matthew
perry
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
convinced
of
the
importance
and
feasibility
of
such
an
undertaking
and
when
he
was
summoned
to
take
charge
of
it
he
made
the
most
thorough
preparation
for
his
task
at
his
suggestion
the
government
procured
all
available
books
maps
and
charts
and
he
made
himself
master
of
every
conceivable
detail
from
manufacturing
establishments
he
secured
models
of
railways
telegraphic
lines
and
other
interesting
industrial
equipments
he
realized
the
necessity
of
taking
with
him
such
a
naval
force
that
its
appearance
in
japanese
waters
would
produce
a
profound
impression
upon
the
government
and
knowing
that
all
his
predecessors
who
had
sought
access
by
way
of
nagasaki
had
been
repelled
he
resolved
to
avoid
it
and
its
portuguese
and
dutch
traditions
and
venture
boldly
into
the
bay
of
yedo
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
a
diplomatic
expedition
was
to
be
despatched
to
japan
under
the
command
of
commodore
perry
he
was
deluged
with
applications
both
from
england
and
america
to
be
permitted
to
join
it
but
perry
resolutely
declined
all
these
enterprising
offers
in
his
long
career
as
a
naval
officer
he
had
seen
the
danger
of
admitting
on
board
persons
who
were
not
under
the
authority
of
the
commander
from
such
dangers
he
meant
to
be
free
he
therefore
refused
to
take
on
board
the
ships
of
his
squadron
any
but
regularly
accredited
officers
and
men
over
whom
he
exercised
legitimate
control
he
even
made
it
a
rule
that
if
any
of
the
officers
kept
diaries
during
the
progress
of
the
expedition
they
should
be
the
property
of
the
navy
department
and
could
not
be
published
without
its
permission
and
authority
commodore
perry
carried
with
him
a
friendly
letter
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
the
emperor
of
japan
who
is
therein
addressed
as
great
and
good
the
letter
pointed
out
the
contiguity
of
the
two
countries
and
the
importance
of
their
friendship
and
commercial
intercourse
it
announced
that
commodore
perry
had
been
sent
to
give
assurance
of
the
friendly
sentiment
of
the
president
and
to
arrange
for
privileges
of
trade
for
the
care
of
shipwrecked
sailors
and
for
the
appointment
of
a
convenient
port
where
coal
and
other
supplies
might
be
obtained
by
the
vessels
of
the
united
states
after
some
provoking
delays
and
disappointments
the
expedition
sailed
from
norfolk
on
the
of
november
proceeding
by
the
way
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
the
china
sea
there
taking
on
board
wells
williams
as
interpreter
and
visiting
several
ports
in

the
bonin
islands
and
the
ryūkyū
islands

illustration
commodore
perry
the
japanese
government
had
been
warned
of
the
preparation
and
coming
of
this
expedition
by
the
dutch
eager
to
maintain
their
position
with
the
government
the
king
of
the
netherlands
addressed
to
the
shōgun
a
letter
in
suggesting
the
relaxation
of
the
laws
excluding
foreign
nations
from
trade
but
in
the
following
year
he
received
an
answer
declining
to
make
any
changes
with
all
the
warning
however
which
the
government
had
received
and
the
preparations
which
had
been
made
for
the
momentous
occasion
the
appearance
of
the
squadron
at
the
entrance
of
yedo
bay
was
an
intense
surprise
two
large
steam
and
the
two
and
the
much
inferior
to
the
squadron
promised
composed
such
an
array
as
had
never
before
made
its
appearance
in
yedo
bay
as
they
plowed
through
the
peaceful
waters
in
full
view
of
the
peak
of
every
height
and
vantage
ground
along
the
shore
seemed
alive
with
troops
and
with
wondering
and
alarmed
inhabitants
the
vessels
came
to
anchor
off
the
village
of
uraga
which
is
not
far
from
the
present
site
of
the
dockyards
at
yokosuka
the
account
of
the
preliminary
negotiations
conducted
by
commodore
perry
with
the
officers
of
the
government
is
interesting
as
showing
the
efforts
made
by
them
to
send
him
to
nagasaki
and
his
absolute
refusal
to
go
thither
or
conduct
his
business
through
the
dutch
or
chinese
when
there
seemed
no
other
way
consent
was
given
to
receive
through
an
officer
of
adequate
rank
the
letter
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
the
emperor
of
japan
when
he
had
formally
delivered
this
letter
he
took
his
departure
with
an
intimation
that
he
would
return
at
a
future
day
and
receive
the
answer
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
display
of
force
which
commodore
perry
took
care
to
make
in
all
his
transactions
with
the
japanese
officials
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
careful
to
convey
assurances
of
his
friendly
purposes
and
objects
produced
a
deep
impression
on
the
government
with
which
he
had
to
deal
it
is
useless
to
deny
that
it
was
on
this
display
of
force
that
commodore
perry
largely
relied
for
the
success
of
his
expedition
that
he
was
prepared
to
use
force
had
it
been
necessary
we
may
feel
sure
but
the
instructions
of
his
government
and
his
own
sense
of
international
justice
bound
him
to
exhaust
every
peaceful
resource
before
resorting
to
measures
of
coercion
the
government
of
the
shōgun
was
greatly
troubled
by
this
responsibility
so
suddenly
laid
upon
it
they
knew
not
what
would
be
the
result
of
their
refusal
to
enter
upon
negotiations
when
perry
returned
the
seclusion
in
which
they
had
kept
themselves
so
long
had
cut
them
off
from
a
knowledge
of
the
relations
in
which
the
nations
of
the
world
stood
to
each
other
notwithstanding
commodore
perry
s
protestations
of
friendliness
they
were
afraid
of
his
great
ships
and
their
powerful
armaments
should
they
as
they
might
easily
do
make
their
way
up
the
bay
till
they
were
within
gunshot
of
the
capital
what
resistance
could
the
government
show
or
how
could
it
prevent
them
from
battering
down
the
castle
and
all
the
daimyōs
residences
the
sentiment
of
loyalty
to
the
emperor
and
opposition
to
the
shōgun
which
had
been
growing
up
so
insidiously
and
had
now
become
really
formidable
was
a
source
of
the
greatest
perplexity
to
the
yedo
government
should
they
proceed
with
their
negotiations
and
make
a
treaty
with
the
americans
this
sentiment
was
ready
to
manifest
itself
against
them
with
terrible
effect
if
they
refused
to
negotiate
then
they
must
be
ready
to
meet
the
invaders
of
their
soil
with
their
miserable
obsolete
armor
and
with
hearts
that
two
hundred
years
of
peace
had
rendered
more
obsolete
than
their
armor
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
consult
the
daimyōs
and
learn
to
what
extent
they
could
rely
on
their
the
daimyō
of
mito
a
descendant
of
the
famous
mitsukuni
seemed
to
have
inherited
one
at
least
of
the
opinions
of
his
ancestor
he
advocated
the
observance
of
a
greater
reverence
for
the
emperor
at
kyōto
and
criticised
the
assumption
of
imperial
powers
by
the
shōgun
at
the
same
time
he
was
an
ardent
and
in
had
been
placed
in
confinement
because
he
had
melted
down
the
bells
of
the
buddhist
temples
of
his
domains
and
cast
cannon
for
their
protection
but
now
he
was
pardoned
and
appointed
to
take
measures
for
the
defence
of
the
country
on
the
of
american
squadron
was
still
in
the
bay
for
it
left
on
the
daimyō
of
mito
sent
in
to
the
government
a
memorial
setting
forth
his
decisive
views
on
the
subject
he
gave
ten
reasons
against
a
treaty
and
in
favor
of
war
we
give
them
here
in
nitobe
s
translation
the
annals
of
our
history
speak
of
the
exploits
of
the
great
who
planted
our
banners
on
alien
soil
but
never
was
the
clash
of
foreign
arms
heard
within
the
precincts
of
our
holy
ground
let
not
our
generation
be
the
first
to
see
the
disgrace
of
a
barbarian
army
treading
on
the
land
where
our
fathers
rest
notwithstanding
the
strict
interdiction
of
christianity
there
are
those
guilty
of
the
heinous
crime
of
professing
the
doctrines
of
this
evil
sect
if
now
america
be
once
admitted
into
our
favor
the
rise
of
this
faith
is
a
matter
of
certainty
what
trade
our
gold
silver
copper
iron
and
sundry
useful
materials
for
wool
glass
and
similar
trashy
little
articles
even
the
limited
barter
of
the
dutch
factory
ought
to
have
been
stopped
many
a
time
recently
have
russia
and
other
countries
solicited
trade
with
us
but
they
were
refused
if
once
america
is
permitted
the
privilege
what
excuse
is
there
for
not
extending
the
same
to
other
nations
the
policy
of
the
barbarians
is
first
to
enter
a
country
for
trade
then
to
introduce
their
religion
and
afterward
to
stir
up
strife
and
contention
be
guided
by
the
experience
of
our
forefathers
two
centuries
back
despise
not
the
teachings
of
the
chinese
opium
war
the
dutch
scholars
say
that
our
people
should
cross
the
ocean
go
to
other
countries
and
engage
in
active
trade
this
is
all
very
desirable
provided
they
be
as
brave
and
strong
as
were
their
ancestors
in
olden
time
but
at
present
the
peace
has
incapacitated
them
for
any
such
activity
the
necessity
of
caution
against
the
ships
now
lying
in
the
harbor
perry
s
squadron
has
brought
the
valiant
to
the
capital
from
distant
quarters
is
it
wise
to
disappoint
them
not
only
the
naval
defence
of
nagasaki
but
all
things
relating
to
foreign
affairs
have
been
entrusted
to
the
two
clans
of
kuroda
and
nabeshima
to
hold
any
conference
with
a
foreign
power
outside
of
the
port
of
has
been
done
this
time
at
to
encroach
upon
their
rights
and
trust
these
powerful
families
will
not
thankfully
accept
an
intrusion
into
their
vested
authority
the
haughty
demeanor
of
the
barbarians
now
at
anchorage
has
provoked
even
the
illiterate
populace
should
nothing
be
done
to
show
that
the
government
shares
the
indignation
of
the
people
they
will
lose
all
fear
and
respect
for
it
peace
and
prosperity
of
long
duration
have
enervated
the
spirit
rusted
the
armor
and
blunted
the
swords
of
our
men
dulled
to
ease
when
shall
they
be
aroused
is
not
the
present
the
most
auspicious
moment
to
quicken
their
sinews
of
war
the
government
sent
to
all
the
daimyōs
copies
of
the
american
letter
to
the
shōgun
and
asked
for
their
opinions
concerning
the
course
to
be
pursued
many
answers
were
immediately
received
they
almost
unanimously
declared
against
the
opening
of
the
country
some
advocated
the
alternative
suggested
in
the
letter
itself
to
open
the
country
temporarily
and
try
the
experiment
for
three
years
or
five
years
or
ten
years
in
the
meantime
the
defences
of
the
country
and
new
and
improved
arms
and
armaments
could
be
perfected
the
government
did
indeed
busy
itself
during
perry
s
absence
in
hurrying
forward
defensive
preparations
the
line
of
forts
which
still
are
visible
in
the
shallow
water
of
the
bay
opposite
shinagawa
the
southern
suburb
of
the
capital
were
hastily
constructed
bells
from
monasteries
and
metal
articles
of
luxury
were
melted
down
and
cast
into
cannon
lessons
were
given
and
became
quickly
fashionable
in
the
use
of
european
and
artillery
the
military
class
from
the
various
clans
flocked
to
yedo
and
kyōto
in
large
numbers
expecting
to
be
called
upon
to
defend
their

intrusion
of
the

this
busy
time
of
perplexity
and
preparation
the
shōgun
ieyoshi
twelfth
of
the
tokugawa
august
his
son
iesada
succeeded
him
as
the
thirteenth
shōgun
the
death
of
the
reigning
shōgun
did
not
produce
any
marked
effect
upon
the
policy
of
the
government
long
before
this
time
the
custom
of
abdication
and
the
habits
of
luxury
and
effeminacy
in
which
the
family
of
the
shōgun
was
reared
had
dragged
the
house
down
to
the
usual
impotent
level
the
government
was
conducted
by
a
system
of
bureaucracy
which
relieved
the
titular
shōguns
from
all
responsibility
and
allowed
them
to
live
in
profitless
voluptuousness
so
that
one
died
and
another
reigned
in
his
stead
without
causing
more
than
a
ripple
upon
the
surface
of
current
events
shortly
after
the
departure
of
the
american
squadron
from
yedo
bay
the
russian
admiral
pontiatine
appeared
in
the
harbor
of
nagasaki
and
made
application
for
a
national
agreement
to
open
ports
for
trade
to
adjust
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
nations
across
the
island
of
saghalien
and
to
live
in
neighborly
intimacy
english
vessels
were
also
in
chinese
waters
watching
the
russians
and
the
war
usually
called
the
crimean
war
actually
broke
out
in
the
spring
of
a
visit
from
these
vessels
might
therefore
be
expected
at
any
time
commodore
perry
during
the
interval
between
his
two
visits
to
japan
sailed
to
the
ports
of
china
where
the
taiping
rebellion
was
then
in
action
the
confusion
and
insecurity
occasioned
by
this
uprising
rendered
the
presence
of
the
squadron
most
acceptable
to
the
american
merchants
on
the
of
february
he
made
his
appearance
a
second
time
in
yedo
bay
with
a
fleet
of
seven
ships
three
steam
frigates
and
four
three
additional
vessels
were
to
join
and
did
join
the
fleet
in
yedo
bay
so
that
when
the
fleet
was
all
mustered
there
were
ten
fully
armed
vessels
comprising
such
an
array
as
had
never
before
appeared
in
japanese
waters
after
some
haggling
about
the
place
where
the
negotiations
should
be
conducted
it
was
finally
settled
that
the
place
of
meeting
should
be
at
kanagawa
near
the
village
now
the
city
of
yokohama
here
after
much
deliberation
and
discussion
proposals
and
amendments
banquets
and
presents
a
treaty
was
agreed
upon
the
signing
and
exchange
took
place
on
the
of
march
it
was
immediately
sent
to
washington
for
ratification

this
was
the
first
formal
treaty
made
with

the
ratification

exchanged
within
eighteen
months
as
might
have
been
expected
as
soon
as
this
treaty
with
the
united
states
had
been
signed
there
was
a
rush
of
other
nations
to
obtain
similar
terms
admiral
sir
john
sterling
acting
in
behalf
of
the
government
of
great
britain
negotiated
a
treaty
which
was
signed
at
nagasaki
on
the
of
october
admiral
pontiatine
negotiated
a
similar
treaty
for
russia
which
was
signed
at
shimoda
on
the
of
february
a
treaty
with
the
netherlands
was
signed
on
the
of
january
none
of
these
were
in
any
general
sense
commercial
treaties
providing
for
trade
and
making
regulations
by
which
it
might
be
conducted
they
were
rather
preliminary
conventions
making
arrangements
for
vessels
to
obtain
necessary
provisions
and
stipulating
for
the
protection
of
those
suffering
shipwreck
and
for
vessels
driven
under
stress
of
weather
to
take
shelter
in
the
harbors
of
japan
they
each
provided
for
admission
to
two
ports
the
american
treaty
to
shimoda
and
hakodate
the
english
treaty
to
nagasaki
and
hakodate
the
russian
treaty
to
shimoda
and
hakodate
all
these
treaties
contained
what
is
called
the
most
favored
nation
clause
so
that
where
the
privileges
granted
to
any
one
nation
were
in
excess
of
those
granted
previously
to
others
these
privileges
were
also
without
further
negotiation
extended
to
the
nations
that
had
already
made
treaties
these
dealings
with
foreign
nations
produced
the
most
intense
excitement
throughout
the
empire
the
old
sentiment
of
hostility
to
foreign
intercourse
showed
itself
in
unmistakable
intensity
the
song
of
the
black
ship
by
which
term
the
vessels
of
foreign
nations
were
designated
was
heard
everywhere
two
distinct
parties
came
into
existence
called
the
party
who
wished
to
expel
the
barbarians
and
the
party
who
were
in
favor
of
opening
the
country
the
members
of
the
latter
party
were
principally
connected
with
the
shōgun
s
government
and
had
become
impressed
with
the
folly
of
trying
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
outside
world
the
party
was
made
up
of
the
conservative
elements
in
the
country
who
clung
to
the
old
traditions
of
japan
that
had
matured
during
the
two
centuries
of
the
tokugawa
rule
besides
these
conservatives
there
was
also
a
party
who
nourished
a
traditional
dislike
to
the
tokugawa
family
and
was
glad
to
see
it
involved
in
difficulties
which
were
sure
to
bring
down
upon
it
the
vengeance
of
the
nation
these
were
chiefly
found
among
the
southwestern
daimiates
such
as
satsuma
chōshū
hizen
and
tosa
the
daimyō
of
mito
although
connected
with
the
shōgun
s
family
was
bitterly
hostile
to
the
policy
of
holding
any
friendly
relations
with
foreigners
he
was
therefore
regarded
as
the
head
of
the
party
and
many
of
the
disaffected
rallied
about
him
as
their
champion
and
leader
it
was
charged
against
the
shōgun
that
in
making
treaties
with
foreign
nations
he
had
transcended
the
powers
that
rightly
belonged
to
him
he
was
not
the
sovereign
of
japan
and
never
had
been
he
was
only
the
chief
executive
under
the
emperor
and
was
not
even
next
in
rank
to
the
emperor
it
was
impossible
therefore
that
treaties
made
by
the
shōgun
and
not
ratified
by
his
sovereign
should
be
regarded
by
the
japanese
as
legitimate
and
binding
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
treaties
which
the
shōgun
had
made
was
an
important
one
and
interested
not
only
the
japanese
themselves
but
the
foreigners
whose
privileges
under
these
treaties
were
at
stake
there
is
no
doubt
that
commodore
perry
as
well
as
all
the
subsequent
negotiators
believed
that
in
making
treaties
with
the
shōgun
they
were
dealing
with
a
competent
authority
the
precedents
occurring
in
the
history
of
japan
seemed
all
to
bear
in
this
direction
the
portuguese
and
the
spanish
had
dealt
with
the
shōgun
and
never
with
the
emperor
the
dutch
had
received
from
ieyasu
the
privileges
of
trade
and
had
ever
since
continued
under
the
shōgun
s
protection
captain
saris
in
his
negotiations
in
received
written
assurances
of
protection
and
privileges
of
trade
from
the
shōgun
it
was
because
the
shōgun
s
power
had
become
weakened
and
there
had
grown
up
an
active
sentiment
against
him
that
the
question
in
reference
to
his
legitimate
authority
arose
had
the
treaty
with
perry
been
concluded
when
the
power
of
yedo
was
at
its
former
height
it
is
probable
that
no
questions
would
have
been
according
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
made
with
the
united
states
it
was
provided
that
a
consul
should
be
appointed
to
reside
at
shimoda
at
any
time
after
the
expiration
of
eighteen
months
from
the
signing
the
in
execution
of
this
provision
the
united
states
government
sent
out
townsend
harris
who
arrived
in
august
after
some
hesitation
he
was
allowed
to
take
up
his
residence
at
shimoda
he
was
a
man
of
great
patience
and
tact
and
gradually
urged
his
way
into
the
confidence
of
the
government
he
became
the
counsellor
and
educator
of
the
officials
in
everything
pertaining
to
foreign
affairs
he
was
received
december
by
the
shōgun
with
the
ceremony
due
to
his
new
rank
of
plenipotentiary
which
he
had
then
received
in
a
despatch
dated
july
he
tells
of
a
severe
illness
which
he
had
suffered
how
the
shōgun
sent
two
physicians
to
attend
him
and
when
a
bulletin
was
sent
to
yedo
that
his
case
was
hopeless
the
physicians
received
peremptory
orders
to
cure
me
and
if
i
died
they
would
themselves
be
in
the
principal
effort
of
harris
was
the
negotiation
of
a
commercial
treaty
which
should
make
provision
for
the
maintenance
of
trade
in
specified
ports
of
japan
the
treaties
already
made
by
japan
with
foreign
nations
only
provided
for
furnishing
vessels
with
needed
supplies
and
for
the
protection
of
vessels
driven
by
stress
of
weather
and
of
persons
shipwrecked
on
the
japanese
islands
it
remained
to
agree
upon
terms
which
should
be
mutually
advantageous
for
the
regular
opening
of
the
ports
for
trade
and
for
the
residence
at
these
ports
of
the
merchants
engaged
in
trade
the
excitement
occasioned
by
the
steps
already
taken
rendered
the
shōgun
s
government
exceedingly
reluctant
to
proceed
further
in
this
direction
it
was
only
after
much
persuasion
and
with
a
desire
to
avoid
appearing
to
yield
to
the
appearance
of
force
with
which
the
english
were
about
to
urge
the
negotiation
of
a
commercial
treaty
that
at
last
on
the
of
june
a
treaty
for
the
purpose
of
further
regulating
the
intercourse
of
american
citizens
within
the
empire
of
japan
was
duly
concluded
the
port
of
nagasaki
was
to
be
opened
in
addition
to
those
already
stipulated
american
citizens
were
to
be
permitted
to
reside
at
shimoda
and
hakodate
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
wants
of
the
vessels
which
visited
there
this
does
not
seem
to
have
been
adequate
for
only
about
a
year
later
a
further
treaty
revoking
that
of
june
was
arranged
it
was
signed
at
yedo
on
the
of
july
equivalent
treaties
were
negotiated
by
other
nations
and
it
is
under
the
terms
of
these
that
the
intercourse
between
japan
and
the
nations
of
europe
and
america
is
still
conducted
they
provided
for
the
opening
of
the
ports
of
and
hyōgo
and
for
the
closing
of
shimoda
which
had
been
found
unsuitable
and
the
opening
in
its
place
of
kanagawa
they
fixed
dates
for
the
opening
of
the
cities
of
yedo
and
ōsaka
and
provided
for
the
setting
apart
of
suitable
concessions
in
each
of
them
for
residence
and
trade
they
provided
that
all
cases
of
litigation
in
which
foreigners
were
defendants
should
be
tried
in
the
consular
court
of
the
nation
to
which
the
defendant
belonged
and
all
cases
in
which
japanese
citizens
were
defendants
should
be
tried
in
japanese
courts
they
fixed
the
limits
within
which
foreigners
at
any
of
the
treaty
ports
could
travel
but
permitted
the
diplomatic
agent
of
any
nation
to
travel
without
limitation
they
prohibited
the
importation
of
opium
commercial
regulations
were
attached
to
the
treaties
and
made
a
part
of
them
which
directed
that
a
duty
of
five
should
be
paid
on
all
goods
imported
into
japan
for
sale
except
that
on
intoxicating
liquors
a
duty
of
should
be
exacted
all
articles
of
japanese
production
exported
were
to
pay
a
duty
of
five
except
gold
and
silver
coin
and
copper
in
bars
these
trade
regulations
stipulated
that
five
years
after
the
opening
of
kanagawa
the
export
and
import
duties
should
be
subject
to
revision
at
the
desire
of
either
party
the
treaties
themselves
provide
that
on
and
after
either
of
the
contracting
parties
may
demand
a
revision
of
the
same
upon
giving
one
year
s
notice
of
its
desire
these
stipulations
in
reference
to
a
revision
of
the
treaties
and
especially
of
the
tariff
of
duties
to
be
paid
on
imported
goods
have
been
a
source
of
great
anxiety
and
concern
to
the
japanese
government
the
small
duty
of
five
which
it
has
been
permitted
to
collect
on
the
goods
imported
is
scarcely
more
than
enough
to
maintain
the
machinery
of
collection
and
while
the
initiative
is
given
to
it
to
ask
for
a
revision
of
the
treaties
it
has
never
yet
been
able
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
principal
nations
concerned
to
any
change
in
the
original
hard
terms
another
provision
in
the
treaties
which
has
been
the
occasion
of
endless
debate
is
that
which
requires
all
foreigners
to
remain
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
consuls
of
their
respective
countries
it
is
claimed
on
the
part
of
the
japanese
that
this
provision
which
was
reasonable
when
the
treaties
were
first
made
is
no
longer
just
or
necessary
the
laws
have
been
so
far
perfected
their
judges
and
officers
have
been
so
educated
and
the
machinery
of
their
courts
have
been
so
far
conformed
to
european
practice
that
it
is
no
longer
reasonable
that
foreigners
residing
in
japan
should
be
under
other
than
japanese
jurisdiction
it
is
earnestly
to
be
hoped
that
these
sources
of
irritation
between
japan
and
the
treaty
powers
may
speedily
be
removed
and
that
the
efforts
of
this
progressive
race
to
fall
into
line
in
the
march
of
civilization
may
be
appreciated
and
encouraged
any
one
who
reads
the
diplomatic
correspondence
covering
this
period
will
see
how
serious
were
the
troubles
with
which
the
country
was
called
upon
to
deal
he
will
realize
also
how
almost
impossible
it
was
for
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
western
powers
to
comprehend
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
or
know
how
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
their
legations
with
justice
and
consideration
a
succession
of
murders
and
outrages
occurred
which
awakened
the
fears
of
the
foreign
residents
it
is
plain
enough
now
that
this
state
of
things
was
not
so
much
due
to
the
want
of
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
carry
out
its
agreements
with
foreign
nations
as
to
the
bitter
and
irreconcilable
party
hatred
which
had
sprung
up
in
consequence
of
these
efforts
the
feudal
organization
of
the
government
by
which
the
first
allegiance
was
due
to
the
daimyō
rendered
the
condition
of
things
more
demoralized
it
was
an
old
feudal
custom
whenever
the
retainers
of
a
daimyō
wished
to
avenge
any
act
without
committing
their
lord
they
withdrew
from
his
service
and
became
most
of
the
outrages
which
occurred
during
the
years
intervening
between
the
formation
of
the
treaties
and
the
restoration
were
committed
by
these
masterless
men
responsibility
for
them
was
disclaimed
by
the
daimyōs
and
the
government
of
yedo
was
unable
to
extend
its
control
over
these
wandering
there
was
no
course
for
the
foreign
ministers
to
pursue
but
to
hold
the
shōgun
s
government
responsible
for
the
protection
of
foreigners
and
foreign
trade
this
government
which
was
called
the
had
made
the
treaties
with
the
foreign
powers
as
many
claimed
without
having
adequate
authority
and
had
thus
assumed
to
be
supreme
in
matters
of
foreign
intercourse
it
was
natural
therefore
that
the
representatives
of
the
treaty
powers
should
look
to
the
for
the
security
of
those
who
had
come
hither
under
the
sanction
of
these
treaties
it
was
in
consequence
a
bloody
time
through
which
the
country
was
called
to
pass
the
prime
minister
and
the
head
of
the
party
was
ii
the
daimyō
of
hikoné
in

had
been

chapter

revolutionary
preludes
the
outrages
which
now
succeeded
each
other
with
terrible
frequency
were
not
confined
to
the
native
members
of
the
opposing
parties
foreigners
who
were
so
essentially
the
cause
of
the
political
disturbances
in
japan
were
particularly
exposed
to
attacks
on
the
of
january
heusken
the
secretary
and
interpreter
of
the
american
legation
when
riding
home
at
night
from
the
prussian
legation
in
yedo
was
attacked
by
armed
assassins
and
mortally
wounded
the
object
of
this
murder
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
desire
of
one
of
the
ministers
of
foreign
affairs
to
take
revenge
on
heusken
for
his
activity
in
promoting
foreign
intercourse
the
weakness
and
the
fears
of
the
government
were
shown
by
the
warning
which
they
sent
to
the
foreign
ministers
to
avoid
attending
the
funeral
of
heusken
lest
further
outrages
might
be
committed
they
did
attend
however
and
no
disturbances
occurred
it
only
remains
to
mention
that
harris
subsequently
made
an
arrangement
with
the
government
for
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
of
to
the
mother
of
heusken
who
was
then
living
at
amsterdam
in
holland
the
next
circumstance
which
awakened
universal
attention
was
an
attack
made
on
the
british
legation
on
the
night
of
the
of
july
at
this
time
the
british
minister
occupied
as
a
legation
the
buildings
of
the
temple
tozenji
situated
at
takanawa
in
the
city
of
yedo
it
was
guarded
by
a
company
of
japanese
troops
to
whom
the
government
had
entrusted
its
protection
alcock
had
just
returned
by
an
overland
journey
from
nagasaki
and
with
a
number
of
other
englishmen
was
domiciled
in
the
legation
the
attacking
party
consisted
of
fourteen
belonging
to
the
mito
clan
who
had
banded
themselves
together
to
take
vengeance
on
the
accursed
several
of
the
guards
were
killed
and
oliphant
the
secretary
of
legation
and
morrison
m
s
consul
at
nagasaki
were
severely
wounded
on
one
of
the
party
who
was
captured
was
found
a
paper
which
set
forth
the
object
of
the
attack
and
the
names
of
the
fourteen
who
had
conspired
for
its
accomplishment
that
the
government
regarded
such
outrages
with
alarm
is
certain
they
took
the
earliest
opportunity
to
express
their
distress
that
the
legation
under
their
protection
had
thus
been
invaded
they
assured
alcock
with
the
most
pitiable
sincerity
that
they
had
no
power
of
preventing
such
attacks
upon
the
legation
nor
of
providing
against
a
renewal
of
the
same
with
a
greater
certainty
of
they
could
not
they
said
guarantee
any
of
the
representatives
against
these
attempts
at
assassination
to
which
all
foreigners
in
japan
were
liable
whether
in
their
houses
or
in
the
public
they
pretended
to
punish
and
yet
were
afraid
openly
to
punish
the
persons
engaged
in
this
attack
they
promised
to
do
what
they
could
for
the
protection
of
the
foreign
representatives
but
their
measures
necessarily
consisted
in
making
the
legations
a
kind
of
prison
where
the
occupants
were
confined
and
protected
and
yet
with
all
these
assurances
of
danger
the
foreign
representatives
seem
to
have
been
singularly
ignorant
of
the
real
difficulties
with
which
the
government
had
to
deal
this
was
due
no
doubt
to
the
want
of
candor
on
the
part
of
the
japanese
officials
in
not
explaining
frankly
and
fully
to
them
the
political
complications
which
existed
between
the
governments
of
yedo
and
kyōto
they
represented
a
widespread
discontent
to
have
grown
up
since
the
negotiation
of
the
treaties
owing
to
the
increased
price
of
provisions
the
derangement
of
the
currency
and
the
danger
of
famine
in
view
of
these
pressing
difficulties
they
asked
for
the
postponement
of
the
time
fixed
by
the
treaties
for
opening
a
port
on
the
western
coast
and
hyōgo
on
the
inland
sea
and
for
the
establishment
of
definite
concessions
in
the
cities
of
yedo
and
ōsaka
these
modifications
of
the
treaties
were
finally
accepted
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
opening
of
the
ports
named
above
should
be
postponed
for
a
period
of
five
years
from
the
first
of
january
this
postponement
of
the
opening
of
the
ports
was
the
chief
reason
for
sending
to
foreign
countries
their
first
embassy
this
set
out
from
yokohama
in
january
and
visited
the
united
states
then
england
and
the
other
treaty
powers
they
were
everywhere
received
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
distinction
the
immediate
object
of
their
mission
was
as
we
have
seen
accomplished
the
opening
of
additional
ports
was
deferred
on
condition
that
in
those
already
opened
the
obstacles
which
had
been
put
in
the
way
of
trade
should
be
removed
but
besides
the
attainment
of
this
end
the
visit
of
the
embassy
to
foreign
capitals
and
countries
produced
a
salutary
influence
both
on
the
foreigners
whom
they
met
and
on
the
influential
personages
of
which
it
consisted
the
former
learned
to
their
surprise
that
they
had
a
cultivated
intelligent
and
clever
race
to
deal
with
whose
diplomatists
although
inexperienced
in
european
politics
were
not
unqualified
to
enter
the
courts
of
western
capitals
but
the
revelation
to
the
japanese
envoys
was
still
greater
and
more
surprising
for
the
first
time
they
saw
the
terrible
armaments
of
western
powers
and
realized
the
futility
of
attempting
to
make
armed
resistance
to
their
measures
but
they
encountered
on
every
hand
not
hatred
and
aversion
but
the
warmest
interest
and
kindness
and
a
desire
to
render
them
every
courtesy
instead
of
barbarians
as
they
had
been
taught
to
regard
all
foreigners
they
found
everywhere
and
intelligent
friends
who
were
anxious
to
see
their
country
treated
with
justice
and
consideration
on
the
of
june
a
year
after
the
first
a
second
attack
was
made
upon
the
british
legation
neale
was
at
this
time
d
and
had
just
removed
from
yokohama
and
resumed
the
occupancy
of
the
temple
of
tozenji
the
government
took
the
precaution
to
establish
guards
who
daily
and
nightly
made
their
rounds
to
protect
the
buildings
besides
this
there
was
a
guard
detailed
from
the
british
fleet
to
render
the
legation
more
secure
the
officials
persisted
in
claiming
that
only
one
person
itō
gumpei
was
engaged
in
the
attack
and
that
it
was
a
matter
of
private
revenge
for
an
insult
which
one
of
the
english
guards
had
put
upon
him
two
of
these
guards
were
killed
in
the
attack
and
itō
gumpei
the
assassin
escaped
to
his
own
house
where
he
was
permitted
to
commit
there
was
probably
no
plot
on
the
part
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
protect
the
legation
but
the
uncertainty
which
hung
over
the
affair
and
the
repetition
of
the
violence
of
the
preceding
year
led
colonel
neale
to
abandon
his
residence
at
yedo
and
return
to
yokohama
an
indemnity
of
was
demanded
and
finally
paid
for
the
families
of
the
two
members
of
the
guard
who
had
been
murdered
in
the
meantime
the
relations
between
the
courts
at
kyōto
and
yedo
had
become
more
and
more
strained
the
efforts
at
reconciliation
such
as
the
marriage
between
the
young
shōgun
and
the
sister
of
the
emperor
in
produced
no
permanent
effect
the
disease
was
too
and
serious
to
be
affected
by
such
palliations
shimazu
saburō
the
uncle
and
guardian
of
the
young
daimyō
of
satsuma
came
in
to
kyōto
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
advising
the
emperor
in
this
emergency
he
was
accompanied
by
a
formidable
body
of
satsuma
troops
and
on
these
he
relied
to
have
his
advice
followed
on
his
way
thither
he
had
been
joined
by
a
body
of
who
were
contemplating
the
accomplishment
of
some
enterprise
which
should
be
notable
in
the
expulsion
of
foreigners
they
imagined
that
the
powerful
head
of
the
satsuma
clan
would
be
a
suitable
leader
for
such
an
enterprise
they
approached
him
therefore
and
humbly
petitioned
to
be
received
under
his
standard
not
quite
satisfied
to
have
such
a
band
of
reckless
ruffians
under
his
command
he
however
scarcely
dared
to
refuse
their
petition
he
therefore
permitted
them
to
join
his
escort
and
march
with
him
to
kyōto
the
emperor
s
court
although
bitterly
hostile
to
the
liberal
policy
which
prevailed
at
yedo
were
alarmed
by
the
desperate
allies
which
shimazu
was
bringing
with
him
he
presented
their
memorial
to
the
emperor
and
favored
their
wishes
to
use
all
the
force
of
the
country
to
dislodge
the
hated
foreigner
from
its
soil
other
powerful
daimyōs
were
collected
at
the
same
time
at
the
imperial
capital
and
its
peaceful
suburbs
resounded
with
the
clank
of
warlike
preparations
the
most
notable
of
these
was
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
who
at
this
time
was
joined
with
the
satsuma
chief
in
the
measures
against
the
shōgun
s
government
shimazu
continued
his
journey
to
yedo
in
the
summer
of
where
he
endeavored
to
impress
on
the
the
necessity
of
taking
measures
to
pacify
the
country
it
is
safe
to
say
that
his
suggestions
were
coldly
received
and
he
was
made
to
feel
that
he
was
in
an
enemy
s
camp
it
is
said
that
the
shōgun
refused
to
receive
him
personally
but
referred
him
for
any
business
which
he
had
to
present
to
the
council
it
is
certain
therefore
when
he
left
yedo
in
september
with
his
train
and
escort
he
was
in
no
amiable
frame
of
mind
and
it
was
in
this
condition
of
irritation
that
he
became
the
chief
actor
in
an
event
which
was
the
saddest
of
all
the
collisions
between
the
japanese
and
the
foreigners
the
satsuma
train
left
yedo
on
the
morning
of
the
of
september
by
way
of
the
which
runs
through
kawasaki
and
skirts
the
village
of
kanagawa
it
consisted
of
a
procession
of
guards
on
foot
and
on
horseback
of
in
which
the
prince
and
his
high
military
and
civil
attendants
were
carried
of
for
them
to
ride
when
they
desired
and
of
a
long
straggling
continuation
of
and
men
carrying
the
luggage
of
the
train
it
was
said
to
contain
not
less
than
eight
hundred
in
attendance
on
their
master
the
etiquette
of
the
road
for
such
trains
was
well
settled
in
feudal
japan
the
right
of
way
was
always
accorded
to
the
daimyō
and
all
unmilitary
persons
or
parties
were
required
to
stand
at
the
side
of
the
road
while
the
train
was
passing
to
dismount
if
on
horseback
and
to
bow
to
the
daimyō
s
as
it
was
carried
past
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
in
attendance
upon
the
incensed
shimazu
were
in
no
humor
to
have
these
rules
trifled
with
and
especially
would
not
deal
very
tenderly
with
any
foreigners
who
might
fall
in
their
way
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
the
satsuma
train
left
yedo
a
small
riding
party
left
yokohama
for
the
village
of
kawasaki
on
a
visit
to
the
temple
at
that
place
it
consisted
of
one
lady
and
three
gentlemen
one
of
whom
was
charles
richardson
who
had
for
many
years
been
a
merchant
at
shanghai
but
who
was
visiting
japan
previous
to
his
return
to
england
a
few
miles
north
of
the
village
of
kanagawa
they
encountered
the
head
of
the
train
and
for
some
distance
passed
successive
parts
of
it
they
were
either
ignorant
of
the
etiquette
which
required
them
to
withdraw
during
the
passage
of
such
a
cavalcade
or
underrated
the
danger
of
disregarding
it
presently
they
came
upon
the
troop
which
had
special
charge
of
the
in
which
the
prince
was
carried
it
was
surrounded
by
a
formidable
body
of
retainers
armed
with
swords
and
spears
the
reckless
riders
paid
little
heed
to
their
scowling
looks
and
rode
carelessly
on
sometimes
even
threading
their
way
through
the
interstices
of
the
straggling
train
when
they
were
nearly
opposite
to
the
prince
s
which
they
were
about
to
pass
without
dismounting
or
saluting
they
were
so
alarmed
by
the
evidences
of
danger
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
called
out
to
richardson
who
was
riding
ahead
don
t
go
on
we
can
turn
into
a
side
the
other
also
exclaimed
for
god
s
sake
let
us
have
no
richardson
who
was
foolhardy
and
ignorant
of
those
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
answered
let
me
alone
i
have
lived
fourteen
years
in
china
and
know
how
to
manage
these
suddenly
a
soldier
from
the
centre
of
the
procession
rushed
upon
them
with
a
heavy
sword
and
struck
richardson
a
fatal
blow
on
his
side
under
the
left
arm
both
the
other
gentlemen
were
also
severely
wounded
and
the
lady
had
her
bonnet
knocked
off
by
a
blow
aimed
at
her
but
escaped
unhurt
they
all
started
at
full
speed
towards
home
riding
over
the
japanese
guards
who
undertook
to
interfere
all
except
richardson
reached
kanagawa
without
further
hurt
he
after
riding
a
few
rods
fell
from
his
horse
and
died
from
the
effect
of
his
terrible
wound
the
excitement
in
the
town
was
intense
there
was
a
proposition
to
organize
immediately
a
force
and
pursue
after
the
train
in
order
to
capture
the
murderer
and
the
satsuma
chief
it
was
with
no
small
effort
and
with
the
almost
unanimous
sentiment
of
the
foreign
community
against
him
that
colonel
neale
the
british
d
restrained
them
from
an
act
which
would
have
brought
quick
vengeance
upon
the
town
and
involved
great
britain
in
a
war
with
japan
a
demand
was
made
upon
the
government
for
the
capture
and
punishment
of
the
assassin
of
richardson
and
for
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
of
by
the
shōgun
s
government
and
an
additional
sum
by
the
daimyō
of
satsuma
neither
the
surrender
of
the
assassin
nor
the
payment
of
this
indemnity
was
willingly
undertaken
by
satsuma
it
ended
therefore
in
admiral
kuper
being
despatched
with
a
squadron
of
seven
vessels
to
kagoshima
in
order
to
enforce
on
the
recalcitrant
daimyō
the
terms
agreed
upon
with
the
government
at
yedo
he
arrived
on
the
of
august
and
was
received
with
frowning
batteries
and
a
terrible
typhoon
of
wind
and
rain
negotiation
failed
to
effect
a
settlement
and
the
naval
force
was
called
upon
to
play
its
part
three
valuable
new
steamers
which
the
daimyō
had
recently
purchased
were
captured
and
burned
the
batteries
which
lined
the
shore
were
dismantled
by
the
guns
of
the
ships
the
city
of
kagoshima
said
to
have
had
at
this
time
a
population
of
and
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
prosperous
towns
in
japan
was
almost
completely
destroyed
by
fire
after
this
drastic
lesson
the
money
demanded
was
paid
but
the
murderer
of
richardson
was
not
and
probably
could
not
be
surrendered
and
never
has
been
publicly
known
the
most
important
result
which
followed
this
severe
experience
was
its
moral
effect
on
the
satsuma
leaders
they
had
become
convinced
that
western
skill
and
western
equipments
of
war
were
not
to
be
encountered
by
the
antiquated
methods
of
japan
to
contend
with
the
foreigner
on
anything
like
equal
terms
it
would
be
necessary
to
acquire
his
culture
and
dexterity
and
avail
themselves
of
his
ships
and
armaments
it
was
not
long
after
this
therefore
that
the
first
company
of
japanese
students
were
sent
to
london
under
the
late
count
terashima
by
the
daimyō
of
satsuma
and
the
purchase
of
cannon
and
ships
of
war
was
authorized
in
the
meantime
another
collision
still
more
serious
had
occurred
with
the
treaty
powers
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
had
as
we
have
seen
taken
sides
with
the
court
of
kyōto
against
the
more
liberal
policy
of
the
shōgun
s
government
he
had
placed
as
guards
and
had
erected
batteries
within
his
territory
on
the
shores
of
the
shimonoseki
straits
through
which
ships
usually
passed
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
western
ports
it
is
claimed
and
is
not
improbable
that
he
was
encouraged
by
the
kyōto
statesmen
to
attack
foreign
ships
on
their
way
through
these
narrow
straits
in
order
to
embroil
the
yedo
government
with
the
treaty
powers
accordingly
on
the
of
june
the
a
small
american
merchant
steamer
on
her
way
from
yokohama
to
nagasaki
was
fired
upon
by
two
belonging
to
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
she
was
not
hit
or
hurt
and
escaped
through
the
bungo
channel
without
injury
shortly
afterwards
on
the
of
july
the
french
gunboat
while
at
anchor
in
the
straits
was
also
fired
upon
and
severely
injured
and
lastly
the
dutch
in
spite
of
a
warning
from
the
undertook
to
pass
the
straits
and
was
fired
upon
by
the
ships
and
batteries
of
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
to
which
she
responded
with
decisive
effect
news
of
these
hostile
acts
was
brought
immediately
to
yokohama
the
steamship
was
lying
there
and
was
at
once
despatched
to
avenge
the
insult
to
the
american
flag
she
arrived
at
shimonoseki
on
july
and
in
a
conflict
with
ships
and
batteries
sunk
a
brig
and
exploded
the
boiler
of
a
steamer
on
the
inst
the
french
frigate
and
the
gunboat
under
the
command
of
admiral
juares
arrived
to
exact
vengeance
for
the
attack
on
the
one
of
the
batteries
was
silenced
and
a
force
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
were
landed
who
destroyed
what
remained
these
acts
of
signal
vengeance
were
followed
by
negotiations
for
damages
the
shōgun
s
government
disavowed
the
actions
of
their
rebellious
subordinate
but
this
did
not
free
them
from
responsibility
for
the
injuries
which
he
had
inflicted
the
american
minister
secured
the
payment
of
twelve
thousand
dollars
for
alleged
losses
by
the
although
as
we
have
seen
the
vessel
got
off
without
any
damage
negotiations
in
regard
to
freeing
the
inland
sea
from
obstructions
dragged
along
for
almost
a
year
the
promised
to
take
measures
to
reduce
to
a
peaceful
attitude
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
whose
territories
bordered
on
the
narrow
straits
of
shimonoseki
but
the
growing
political
disturbances
of
the
nation
and
the
impoverishment
of
the
shōgun
s
treasury
made
it
impossible
to
carry
out
its
pacific
designs
finally
an
expedition
was
organized
by
the
treaty
powers
to
visit
shimonoseki
in
order
to
destroy
whatever
might
be
in
existence
there
it
consisted
of
nine
british
four
dutch
three
french
and
one
steamer
chartered
for
the
occasion
to
represent
the
united
states
it
sailed
from
yokohama
on
the
and
of
august
the
attack
was
made
from
the
to
the
of
september
the
daimyō
finding
it
useless
to
contend
against
such
overwhelming
odds
gave
in
his
absolute
submission
after
the
return
of
the
expedition
the
representatives
of
the
allied
powers
held
a
conference
with
the
japanese
ministers
of
foreign
affairs
with
reference
to
the
final
settlement
of
this
unfortunate
business
a
convention
was
entered
into
between
the
interested
parties
dated
the
of
october
by
which
an
indemnity
of
three
million
dollars
was
to
be
paid
by
japan
to
the
four
powers
for
damages
and
for
expenses
entailed
by
the
operations
against
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
this
sum
was
to
be
paid
in
instalments
of
half
a
million
dollars
each
the
four
powers
agreed
among
themselves
as
to
the
division
of
this
indemnity
that
france
the
netherlands
and
the
united
states
in
consideration
of
the
actual
attacks
made
on
their
shipping
were
to
receive
each
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
dollars
and
that
the
remaining
sum
should
be
divided
equally
between
the
four
powers
it
has
always
been
felt
that
the
exaction
of
this
large
indemnity
was
a
harsh
if
not
an
unwarrantable
proceeding
the
government
of
yedo
had
disavowed
and
apologized
for
the
conduct
of
the
rebellious
daimyō
and
promised
if
time
were
allowed
to
reduce
him
to
subjection
of
the
powers
which
were
allied
in
the
expedition
great
britain
had
suffered
no
damage
and
the
united
states
had
already
received
an
indemnity
for
the
injuries
and
expenses
of
the
vessel
fired
upon
to
insist
therefore
upon
the
government
not
only
paying
for
the
damage
inflicted
but
for
the
expense
of
an
unnecessarily
large
and
costly
expedition
to
suppress
the
rebellious
subordinate
which
was
sent
contrary
to
the
express
protest
of
the
responsible
government
seems
too
much
like
that
overbearing
diplomacy
with
which
western
nations
have
conducted
their
intercourse
in
the
east
the
promised
sum
however
was
at
last
after
much
financial
distress
all
paid
and
the
painful
episode
was
ended
one
undesigned
benefit
resulted
from
the
shimonoseki
expedition
just
as
the
bombardment
of
kagoshima
had
taught
the
daimyō
of
satsuma
the
folly
of
resisting
western
armaments
so
now
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
had
learned
by
an
expensive
experience
the
same
bitter
lesson
for
the
future
these
two
powerful
clans
might
therefore
be
counted
on
not
only
to
oppose
the
moribund
government
of
yedo
but
to
withstand
the
folly
of
trying
to
expel
the
foreigners
who
by
treaty
with
an
unauthorized
agent
had
been
admitted
into
the
country
the
chōshū
leaders
had
also
taken
advantage
of
their
experiences
in
this
conflict
with
foreigners
to
put
their
troops
on
a
better
basis
as
regards
arms
and
organization
for
the
first
time
the
privilege
of
the
to
do
all
the
fighting
was
disregarded
and
a
division
of
troops
was
formed
from
the
common
people
which
was
armed
with
foreign
muskets
and
drilled
in
the
western
tactics
they
went
by
the
name
of
irregular
troops
and
played
no
small
part
in
rendering
nugatory
the
efforts
of
the
shōgun
to
chastise
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
in
and
another
noteworthy
military
event
deserves
mention
here
colonel
neale
had
applied
to
his
government
for
a
military
guard
to
protect
british
interests
at
yokohama
two
companies
of
the
regiment
were
sent
from
hongkong
and
with
the
consent
of
the
japanese
government
took
up
their
residence
in
at
barracks
in
the
foreign
settlement
they
were
afterwards
joined
by
a
french
contingent
and
for
many
years
they
were
a
familiar
sight
and
gave
a
sense
of
security
to
the
nervous
residents
while
these
serious
collisions
were
taking
place
between
japan
and
the
foreign
powers
there
was
an
increasing
and
irreconcilable
animosity
developed
between
the
kyōto
and
yedo
governments
the
ostensible
reason
which
was
put
forward
on
all
occasions
was
the
difference
of
opinion
upon
the
question
of
the
foreign
treaties
and
foreign
intercourse
the
yedo
government
had
by
the
force
of
circumstances
become
practically
familiar
with
the
views
of
the
representatives
of
foreign
nations
and
had
been
convinced
that
the
task
of
expelling
foreigners
and
returning
again
to
the
ancient
policy
of
seclusion
was
far
beyond
the
power
of
japan
on
the
contrary
the
court
of
the
emperor
was
a
of
sentiment
in
which
all
the
ancient
prejudices
of
the
empire
naturally
flourished
and
where
the
feudal
princes
who
were
jealous
of
the
shōgun
found
a
ready
element
in
which
to
foment
difficulties
two
important
games
were
in
progress
yedo
was
the
field
on
which
one
of
these
was
to
be
decided
and
the
players
were
the
representatives
of
the
treaty
powers
on
the
one
side
and
the
shōgun
s
government
on
the
other
victory
had
already
been
virtually
declared
in
favor
of
an
open
country
and
foreign
intercourse
the
other
game
was
being
played
at
kyōto
between
the
shōgun
s
friends
and
his
enemies
the
stake
was
a
momentous
one
namely
to
determine
whether
the
present
dual
government
was
to
continue
and
who
was
hereafter
to
wield
the
destinies
of
the
empire
the
government
of
the
shōgun
had
long
been
convinced
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
best
of
the
presence
of
foreigners
in
the
country
and
that
it
was
vain
to
make
further
exertions
for
their
expulsion
but
a
vast
number
of
the
feudal
retainers
of
the
daimyōs
were
still
bitterly
hostile
and
took
frequent
occasion
to
commit
outrages
for
which
the
government
was
held
responsible
besides
the
cases
which
have
been
already
mentioned
a
new
legation
which
the
british
government
had
built
in
gotenyama
a
site
which
the
japanese
government
had
set
apart
in
yedo
for
foreign
legations
was
burned
to
the
ground
in
in
the
same
year
the
temple
buildings
in
yedo
which
the
united
states
had
leased
for
a
legation
were
burned
twice
the
shōgun
s
castle
in
yedo
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
a
murderous
attack
was
made
upon
british
subjects
in
nagasaki
lieutenant
de
cannes
of
the
french
troops
was
assassinated
in
and
in
the
same
year
major
baldwin
and
lieutenant
bird
two
british
officers
were
murdered
at
kamakura
these
repeated
outrages
seriously
disturbed
the
yedo
government
and
led
to
several
attempts
to
curtail
the
privileges
which
by
the
treaties
were
secured
to
foreigners
the
last
proposition
of
the
kind
which
was
made
was
one
conveyed
to
the
french
government
by
an
embassy
sent
out
in
they
presented
a
request
to
have
the
port
of
kanagawa
closed
up
and
trade
to
be
confined
to
hakodate
and
nagasaki
they
received
no
encouragement
however
and
returned
with
their
eyes
opened
by
the
high
state
of
material
and
moral
prosperity
which
surrounded
them
and
reported
the
complete
failure
of
their
attempts
at
persuasion
the
reprimanded
them
for
having
disgraced
their
functions
and
reducing
their
incomes
forced
them
to
retire
into
private
it
is
necessary
now
to
trace
the
course
of
events
at
kyōto
according
to
the
theory
of
the
government
of
japan
the
emperor
was
the
supreme
and
unlimited
ruler
and
the
shōgun
was
his
executive
the
maintenance
of
the
emperor
and
his
court
was
a
function
of
the
shōgun
and
hence
it
was
almost
always
possible
for
him
to
compel
the
emperor
to
pursue
any
policy
which
he
might
desire
at
the
time
now
under
review
kōmei
the
father
of
the
present
emperor
occupied
the
imperial
throne
he
had
succeeded
to
this
dignity
in
at
the
age
of
eighteen
and
he
died
in
at
the
age
of
the
shōgun
was
iemochi
who
in
had
been
chosen
from
the
family
of
kii
because
of
the
failure
of
an
heir
in
the
regular
line
at
the
time
of
his
election
he
was
a
boy
of
twelve
years
of
age
and
was
placed
under
the
guardianship
of
the
prime
minister
ii
after
the
assassination
of
the
prime
minister
in
hitotsubashi
gyōbukyō
a
son
of
the
daimyō
of
mito
was
appointed
guardian
and
served
in
this
capacity
until
the
shōgun
s
death
around
the
court
of
the
emperor
were
gathered
many
discordant
elements
the
party
of
the
shōgun
was
always
represented
and
the
daimyō
of
aizu
its
ardent
friend
and
champion
had
the
honorable
distinction
of
guarding
the
imperial
palace
by
invitation
many
other
daimyōs
were
at
kyōto
with
retinues
of
officers
and
attendants
and
with
guards
of
troops
the
southern
and
western
daimyōs
were
present
in
imposing
numbers
and
although
they
did
not
always
agree
among
themselves
they
were
in
harmony
in
the
general
purpose
to
discredit
the
government
at
yedo
and
to
promote
the
imperial
authority
the
expulsion
of
foreigners
was
the
common
subject
of
discussion
and
agitation
although
again
and
again
it
had
been
assured
that
it
was
impossible
to
dislodge
the
treaty
powers
from
their
position
in
the
country
the
court
still
continued
to
direct
its
efforts
to
this
object
for
the
first
time
in
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
when
iemitsu
went
up
to
the
imperial
court
the
shōgun
iemochi
visited
kyōto
in
in
order
to
consult
about
the
affairs
of
the
country
in
accordance
with
the
precedent
set
by
iemitsu
the
shōgun
distributed
on
this
occasion
rich
presents
to
the
emperor
and
the
officers
of
his
court
he
also
scattered
among
the
townspeople
his
largesses
until
the
whole
populace
moistened
in
the
bath
of
his
mercy
and
goodness
were
greatly
pleased
and
conferences
were
held
between
the
daimyōs
who
were
present
in
kyōto
and
the
officials
of
the
court
and
in
spite
of
the
objections
and
remonstrances
of
the
yedo
official
an
imperial
edict
was
issued
and
entrusted
to
the
shōgun
for
execution
to
expel
from
the
country
the
hated
foreigners
this
edict
was
notified
to
the
representatives
of
the
treaty
powers
by
the
yedo
officials
they
seemed
however
to
regard
their
duty
fully
done
when
this
notice
was
given
no
serious
steps
were
ever
taken
to
carry
out
these
expulsive
measures
unless
the
obstruction
of
navigation
of
the
shimonoseki
straits
by
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
be
regarded
of
this
character
in
a
plot
was
alleged
to
have
been
formed
by
the
chōshū
men
to
seize
the
emperor
and
carry
him
off
to
their
own
territory
the
object
aimed
at
by
this
plot
was
of
course
to
get
the
court
out
of
the
hands
of
the
shōgun
s
friends
and
surround
it
by
influences
favorable
to
the
plans
of
the
southern
daimyōs
the
court
however
became
alarmed
by
the
reports
in
circulation
and
steps
were
taken
to
forbid
the
chōshū
troops
who
guarded
sakaimachi
gate
access
to
the
grounds
of
the
imperial
palace
offended
by
this
action
they
retired
to
their
own
territory
seven
of
the
most
prominent
court
nobles
who
sympathized
with
chōshū
in
his
aims
and
purposes
accompanied
them
and
were
thereupon
deprived
of
their
rank
and
revenue
the
departure
of
the
chōshū
clansmen
and
the
triumph
of
the
shōgun
s
party
seemed
to
have
put
an
end
to
the
policy
the
emperor
and
his
court
had
been
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
effort
to
expel
the
treaty
powers
was
far
beyond
the
powers
of
japan
even
if
it
were
united
and
its
exertions
directed
from
one
centre
from
this
time
may
be
estimated
to
begin
a
new
phase
in
the
contest
which
was
to
end
in
the
restoration
of
the
original
form
of
government
the
territory
of
chōshū
had
become
the
rendezvous
for
all
the
disaffected
elements
of
the
empire
the
daimyō
was
looked
upon
as
the
patriotic
leader
of
the
country
and
from
all
parts
hastened
to
enroll
themselves
under
his
banner
in
the
summer
of
the
chōshū
forces
to
the
number
of
several
thousand
composed
not
only
of
the
of
the
province
but
also
of
the
disaffected
who
had
gathered
there
and
of
the
irregular
troops
which
had
been
organized
started
to
kyōto
in
order
to
regain
the
position
they
had
previously
occupied
the
contest
which
followed
has
been
described
with
lurid
distinctness
by
native
annalists
they
were
encountered
by
hitotsubashi
in
command
of
the
troops
of
aizu
echizen
hikoné
and
other
loyal
clans
after
a
battle
which
lasted
several
days
and
which
raged
chiefly
about
the
imperial
palace
the
chōshū
troops
were
completely
defeated
and
forced
to
retire
it
gives
us
an
idea
of
the
terrible
earnestness
of
these
japanese
warriors
to
read
how
a
little
remnant
of
the
chōshū
troops
took
refuge
on
tennōzan
and
when
they
heard
their

was
ended
with
no
credit
to

shōgun
s
party
but
with
a
distinct
gain
to
the
cause
of
the
imperial
restoration
it
had
long
been
recognized
that
the
treaties
which
had
been
made
by
the
foreign
powers
would
possess
a
greatly
increased
influence
on
the
japanese
people
if
they
could
have
the
sanction
of
the
emperor
the
shōgun
iemochi
had
been
summoned
to
kyōto
by
the
emperor
to
consult
upon
the
concerns
of
the
nation
and
was
occupying
his
castle
at
ōsaka
the
representatives
of
the
foreign
powers
thereupon
concluded
that
it
would
be
a
timely
movement
to
proceed
with
their
naval
armaments
to
hyōgo
and
wait
upon
the
shōgun
at
ōsaka
with
the
purpose
of
urging
him
to
obtain
the
imperial
approval
of
the
treaties
this
was
accordingly
done
and
an
impressive
display
of
the
allied
fleets
was
made
at
the
town
which
has
since
been
opened
to
foreign
trade
the
shōgun
was
both
young
and
irresolute
and
personally
had
neither
weight
nor
influence
but
his
guardian
hitotsubashi
was
a
man
of
mature
years
and
judgment
he
recognized
the
importance
of
obtaining
the
approval
of
the
emperor
to
the
foreign
treaties
and
of
thus
ending
the
long
and
ruinous
agitation
which
prevailed
in
the
country
a
memorial
was
presented
to
the
emperor
in
the
name
of
the
shōgun
setting
forth
the
embarrassment
under
which
the
administration
of
the
country
had
been
conducted
on
account
of
the
supposed
opposition
of
the
emperor
to
the
treaties
and
begging
him
to
relieve
them
by
signifying
his
sanction
and
assuring
him
that
if
this
is
not
given
the
foreign
representatives
who
are
at
hyōgo
will
proceed
to
the
capital
and
demand
it
at
his
hands
it
ended
in
the
sanction
of
the
treaties
being
signified
october
by
the
following
laconic
decree
addressed
to
the
shōgun
the
imperial
consent
is
given
to
the
treaties
and
you
will
therefore
undertake
the
necessary
arrangements
during
this
critical
time

died
september
at
his
castle
in
ōsaka
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
had
been
chosen
in
in
the
absence
of
a
regular
heir
by
the
determined
influence
of

was
then
at

was

young

been
under
his
guardianship

then
that
duty
had
been
devolved
upon
hitotsubashi
a
son
of
the
diamyō
of
mito
who
had
been
himself
strongly
pressed
for
the
office
of

but
who
was
alleged
to
be
too
mature
and
resolute

the
prime

purposes
as
guardian
hitotsubashi
had
taken
an
active
part
in
the
effort
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
treaties
and
the
final
success
of
this
important
step
must
in
a
great
measure
be
attributed
to
him
after
the
death
of
iemochi
without
direct
heirs
the
office
of
shōgun
was
offered
to
hitotsubashi
as
a
representative
of

of
the
honorable
families
from
whom
a
shōgun
was
to
be
chosen
in
case
of
a
failure
of
direct
heirs
it
is
said
that
he
accepted
the
office
with
great
reluctance
knowing
the
troubles
which
would
surely
await
him
who
assumed
it
he
assented
only
on
the
command
of
the
emperor
and
the
assurance
of
support

died
from

strongly

foreign
intercourse
and
it
was
claimed
at
the
time
of
his
death
that
when
he
sanctioned
the
foreign
treaties
the
divine
nature
left
him
to
fall
a
prey
to
the
ravages
of

disease

fifteenth

succeeded
him
and

reigning

it
was
thought
that
the
death
of
an
emperor

strong
prejudices

of
a
mature
age
would
naturally
favor
a
more
complete
control

it
was
not
to
be
anticipated
that
an
emperor

youth
would
pursue
the

policy
as
his
father
and
undertake
to
assume
a
real
and
active
part
in

government

country
but
the
shōgun
and
his
friends
underrated
the
influences
which
were
gathered
at
kyōto
and
which
now
went
far
beyond
an
sentiment

were
chiefly
concerned

schemes

liberal
sentiments
and
of
great
penetration
addressed
a
letter
to
the
shōgun
in
october
in
which
he
frankly
says
the
cause
of
our
trouble
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
administration
proceeds
from
two
centres
causing
the
empire
s
eyes
and
ears
to
be
turned
in
two
different
directions
the
march

events
has
brought
about
a
revolution

the
old
system
can
no
longer
be
persevered
in

should
restore
the
governing
power
into
the
hands
of

sovereign

so
lay

foundation

the
shōgun
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
wisdom
of
this
advice
drew
up
a
document
addressed
to
his
vassals
asking
their
opinion
of
the
advisability
of
his
resignation
among
other
things
he
says
it
appears
to
me
that
the
laws
can
not
be
maintained
in
face
of
the
daily
extension
of
our
foreign
relations
unless
the
government
be
conducted
by

head
and

propose
therefore
to
surrender
the
whole
governing
power
into

hands

is
the
best
i

an
end
that
this
surrender
might

declined

perhaps
the
hope

wish
of

last
shōgun

it
was
not
to

powerful
clans
who
for
years
had
labored
for
the
destruction
of
the
tokugawa

were
ready
to
undertake

responsibility

a

government

although
the
change
was
not

from

point
may
be

the
restored
empire
the
resignation
of
the
shōgun
was
accepted
by
the
emperor
on
the
understanding
that
a
conference
of
the
daimyōs
was
to
be
called
and
its
opinion
taken
in

to
the
subsequent
conduct

under
the
command
of
the
emperor
was
to
continue
the
administration
particularly
of
those
interests
which
concerned
the
foreign
powers
but
the
allied
western
daimyōs
feared
the
effect
of
leaving
the
administration
in
the
hands
of
their
enemies
the
possession
of
the
person
of
the
emperor
was
always
reckoned
an
important
advantage
especially
was
this
the
case
when
the
emperor
was
only
a
boy
whose
influence
in
the
affairs
of
the
government
could
have
little
weight
they
resolved
therefore
to
take
measures
which
would
definitely
ensure
the
termination
of
the
shōgun
s
power
and
secure
for
themselves
the
result
for
which
they
had
been
so
long
laboring
on
january
by
a
order
of
the
emperor
but
really
by
the
agreement
of
the
allied
daimyōs
the
troops
of
the
aizu
clan
who
were
in
charge
of
the

were
dismissed
from

duty

appointed
to

departments
a
decree
was
issued
announcing
that
the
government
of
the
country
was
henceforth
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
imperial
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
new
government
was
to
recall
the
daimyō
of
chōshū
who
had
been
expelled
from
kyōto
in
and
to
invite
back
the
who
had
been
exiled
and
deprived
of
their
revenues
and
honors
the
sentence
of
confiscation
which
had
been
pronounced
upon
them
was
abrogated
and
they
were
restored
to
their
former
privileges
one

them
sanjo
saneyoshi
as
prime
minister
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
reviving
the
ancient
and
original
form
of
government
the
chōshū
troops
who
had
been
driven
out
of
the
capital
in
were
recalled
and
given
a
share
with
the
loyal
clans
in
guarding
the
palace
of
the
emperor
this
powerful
clan
which
had
suffered
such
a
varied
experience
was
destined
to
take
and
maintain
a
leading
position
in
the
future
development
of
the
restored
empire
the
aizu
and
other
clans
which
had
been
devoted
friends
of
the
tokugawa
shōguns
were
especially
outraged
by
this
conciliatory
spirit
shown
to
the
chōshū
troops
they
claimed
that
this
clan
by
resisting
the
imperial
commands
had
merited
the
opprobrious
title
of
rebels
and
were
no
longer
fit
for
the
association
of
loyal
clans
but
the
chōshū
daimyō
had
been
restored
to
the
favor
of
his
emperor
and
moreover
was
allied
with
the
clans
whose
power
was
paramount
at
kyōto
so
that
the
disapprobation
of
the
tokugawa
adherents
had
little
terror
for
him
at
the
suggestion
of
his
friends
the
shōgun
retired
to
his
castle
at
ōsaka
and
the
troops
attached
to
his
cause
also
retreated
and
gathered
under
his
standard
the
situation
of
affairs
was
for
a
time
uncertain
the
shōgun
had
resigned
and
his
resignation
had
been
accepted
but
he
had
been
asked
by
the
emperor
to
continue
his
administration
subsequently
under
the
pressure
of
the
allied
clans
the
emperor
had
abolished
the
shōgunate
and
entrusted
the
administration
to
a
provisional
government
this
last
action

friends
of
the
resented
as
the
doings
of
revolutionists
it
is
believed
that
he
himself
was
averse
to
further
conflict
any
step
which
he
might
take
in
the
vindication
of
his
rights
must
involve
war
with
the
allied
clans
and
he
was
not
a
man
of
war
while
these
critical
events
were
taking
place
the
representatives
of
foreign
powers
came
down
from
yedo
to

with
an
impressive
array
of
by
invitation
of
the
they
visited
him
at
ōsaka
in
reply
to
the
representatives
he
made
an
address
complaining
of
the
arbitrary
conduct
of
those
who
now
had
possession
of
the
imperial
person
and
notifying
them
that
he
was
willing
and
able
to
protect
their
rights
under
the
treaties
and
asking
them
to
await
the
action
of
a
conference
to
be
summoned
in
consequence
of
the
conflict
which
was
now
imminent
the
representatives
of
the
treaty
powers
issued
a
notice
to
their
citizens
that
neutrality
must
be
maintained
under
all
circumstances
and
arms
and
ammunition
must
not
be
sold
to
either
party
the
first
armed
conflict
between
the
two
parties
took
place
during
the
closing
days
of
january
two
of
the
allied
daimyōs
owari
and
echizen
were
sent
to
ōsaka
to
confer
with
the
in
the
hope
that
some
terms
might
be
agreed
upon
by
which
further
difficulty
could
be
avoided

to

they
offered
to
the
an
honorable
appointment
and
if
he
would
come
to
kyōto
they
assured
him
a
ready
audience
before
the
emperor
he
promised
to
obey
the
emperor
s
command
and
visit
the
capital
after
the
envoys
had
gone
his
friends
raised
suspicions
in
his
mind
concerning
his
personal
safety
the
daimyōs
of
aizu
and
kuwana
offered
to
accompany
him
in
case
he
determined
to
go
they
organized
therefore
a
force
of
about
men
with
which
they
proposed
to
escort
him
he
must
have
known
that
a
formidable
military
escort
like
this
would
precipitate
a
conflict
however
he
set
out
the
news
of
the
preparations
of
the
was
brought
to
kyōto
and
aroused
a
determination
to
resist
his
invasion
of
the
capital
he
had
been
invited
to
the
palace
by
the
emperor
but
he
was
to
come
as
a
peaceful
visitor
if
he
had
determined
to
come
with
a
guard
composed
of
the
enemies
of
the
empire
he
must
be
resisted
troops
of
the
satsuma
and
chōshū
clans
were
therefore
posted
to
intercept
the
march
of
the
s
escort
it
is
believed
that
they
numbered
about
men
the
fighting
took
place
on
the
roads
leading
from
ōsaka
to
kyōto
and
lasted
during
the
and
of
january
it
ended
in
the
complete
defeat
of
the
rebel
army
although
it
so
far
outnumbered
its
adversaries
the
being
thus
disappointed
in
his
plan
to
enter
the
capital
with
a
commanding
force
retired
to
his
castle
at
ōsaka
from
which
he
proceeded
on
a
steam
corvette
to
yedo
the
castle
at
ōsaka
was
burnt
and
the
defeated
troops
made
their
way
by
land
to
the
same
rendezvous
the
antipathy
existing
between
the
satsuma
clan
and
the
tokugawa
adherents
showed
itself
in
a
very
pronounced
manner
in
yedo
the
satsuma
which
was
occupied
by
troops
of
that
clan
and
by
favorable
to

surrounded
by
tokugawa
troops
and
burnt
collisions
between
the
two
parties
were
of
constant
occurrence
which
continued
until
the
arrival
of
the
imperial
troops
restored
order
in
hyōgo
too
which
with
ōsaka
was
opened
to
foreign
trade
on
the
first
of
january
there
were
difficulties
between
the
foreigners
and
element
in
the
population
but
these
troubles
rapidly
disappeared
because
the
new
government
took
pains
at
once
to
make
it
plain
that
the
treaties
with
foreign
powers
were
to
be
kept
and
outrages
committed
against
those
who
were
in
the
country
under
these
treaties
were
not
to
be
tolerated
on
february
the
emperor
sent
to
the
foreign
representatives
a
request
that
they
communicate
to
their
governments
the
fact
that
hereafter
the
administration
of
both
internal
and
external
affairs
would
be
conducted
by
him
and
that
officers
would
be
appointed
to
conduct
the
business
which
may
arise
under
the
foreign
treaties
in
token
of
the
sincerity
of
this
communication
an
invitation
was
conveyed
to
the
representatives
of
the
powers
then
at
hyōgo
to
present
themselves
before
the
emperor
on
march
the
significance
of
this
event
can
scarcely
now
be
conceived
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
empire
had
its
divine
head
deigned
to
admit
to
his
presence
the
despised
foreigner
or
put
himself
on
an
equality
with
the
sovereign
of
the
foreigner
the
event
created
in
the
ancient
capital
the
utmost
excitement
the
french
and
dutch
ministers
had
each
in
turn
been
conducted
to
the
palace
and
had
been
received
in
audience
no
serious
incident
had
occurred
but
during
the
progress
of
sir
harry
parkes
the
british
representative
from
his
lodgings
to
the
palace
two
fanatical
rushed
upon
his
escort
and
before
they
could
be
overpowered
wounded
nine
of
them
one
of
the
assassins
was
killed
and
the
other
was
captured
after
being
desperately
wounded
the
party
returned
at
once
to
the
lodgings
of
the
envoy
who
fortunately
was
uninjured
the
court
by
whose
invitation
the
ministers
had
undertaken
to
present
themselves
before
the
emperor
was
overwhelmed
with
mortification
high
officers
at
once
waited
upon
sir
harry
and
tendered
their
sympathy
and
profound
regret
after
making
every
reparation
in
their
power
arrangements
were
made
to
hold
the
audience
on
the
day
following
that
originally
appointed
it
was
held
accordingly
without
further
incident
warned
by
this
alarming
occurrence
the
government
issued
an
edict
that
as
the
treaties
had
now
been
sanctioned
by
the
emperor
the
protection
of
foreigners
was
henceforth
his
particular
care
that
if
therefore
any
were
to
be
guilty
of
an
outrage
against
them
he
should
be
degraded
from
his
rank
and
denied
the
honorable
privilege
of
committing
he
should
suffer
the
punishment
of
a
common
criminal
and
have
his
head
exposed
in
token
of
dishonor
miyeda
shigeru
the
surviving
culprit
was
thus
punished
the
scene
of
the
brief
contest
was
now
shifted
to
the
east
the
seemed
to
vacillate
between
a
complete
surrender
of
his
power
and
a
provisional
retention
of
it
until
the
will
of
the
nation
could
be
taken
by
a
conference
of
the
daimyōs
on
the
arrival
of
the
imperial
forces
in
yedo
the
final
terms
of
his
future
treatment
were
announced
to
the
that
he
retire
to
mito
and
there
live
in
seclusion
that
the
castle
in
yedo
be
evacuated
and
that
the
vessels
and
armaments
now
in
the
possession
of
the
be
surrendered
these
terms
were
accepted
and
he
took
up
his
residence
in
his
ancestral
province
of
mito
subsequently
he
was
permitted
to
remove
to
the
castle
of
sumpu
at
shizuoka
with
him
the
dynasty
of
tokugawa
shōguns
vanishes
from
history
his
adherents
however
still
continued
to
resist
the
imperial
forces
for
months
the
aizu
troops
hovered
about
yedo
and
at
last
came
to
blows
with
the
imperial
troops
at
the
grounds
of
the
uyeno
temple
on
july
it
was
a
battle
and
was
at
last
decided
by
an
armstrong
gun
in
the
hands
of
the
hizen
troops
the
fine
old
temple
was
destroyed
and
the
rebel
forces
withdrew
to
the
north
further
complications
at
utsunomiya
at
last
they
were
ended
by
the
surrender
of
the
castle
of
wakamatsu
where
the
daimyō
of
aizu
had
made
a
stand
with
generous
fortitude
he
took
the
blame
upon
himself
and
submitted
to
the
clemency
of
his
sovereign
it
is
only
necessary
now
in
order
to
bring
to
a
close
the
account
of
this
short
military
contest
to
refer
to
the
movements
of
the
fleet
lying
at
shinagawa
it
will
be
remembered
that
by
the
terms
accepted
by
the
these
vessels
were
to
be
surrendered
to
the
imperial
forces
there
were
seven
of
them
mounting
in
all
guns
they
were
under
the
command
of
enomoto
who
had
learned
in
holland
the
science
of
naval
war
he
did
not
approve
of
his
master
surrendering
these
muniments
of
war
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
vessels
were
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
imperial
commander
they
had
disappeared
from
their
anchorage
in
the
night
enomoto
had
got
up
steam
crept
out
through
yedo
bay
and
sailed
northward
to
more
friendly
climes
the
imperial
fleet
followed
and
after
some
manœuvring
at
sendai
proceeded
to
hakodate
here
the
warlike
operations
between
the
rebels
and
the
imperial
troops
lasted
till
july
finally
the
leaders
enomoto
and
matsudaira
tarō
seeing
that
it
was
hopeless
to
contend
longer
against
a
constantly
increasing
enemy
offered
to
commit
in
order
that
their
followers
might
be
saved
by
a
surrender
their
unselfish
purpose
was
not
however
permitted
then
it
was
determined
that
the
two
leaders
should
give
themselves
up
to
the
besiegers
to
save
the
rest
this
was
done
the
prisoners
were
sent
to
yedo
and
their
gallant
conduct
and
heroic
devotion
to
the
cause
of
their
prince
were
so
keenly
appreciated
that
they
were
all
pardoned
while
these
events
were
transpiring
in
the
east
and
north
the
work
of
establishing
a
system
of
administration
was
proceeded
with
at
kyōto
a
constitution
was
drawn
up
detailing
the
various
departments
of
the
government
and
the
duties
of
the
officers
in
each
these
departments
were
of
supreme
administration
of
the
shintō
religion
of
home
affairs
of
foreign
affairs
of
war
of
finance
of
judicial
affairs
of
legislative
affairs
this
scheme
underwent
several
changes
and
for
a
long
time
was
regarded
as
only
tentative
the
ablest
men
in
the
movements
which
were
now
in
progress
were
afraid
of
the
traditions
of
indulgence
and
effeminacy
which
attached
to
the
court
at
kyōto
in
order
to
restore
the
government
to
a
true
and
basis
it
seemed
necessary
to
cut
loose
from
the
centuries
of
seclusion
in
which
the
emperor
had
remained
and
enter
upon
the
work
of
governing
the
empire
as
a
serious
and
solemn
task
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
ōkubo
toshimichi
of
satsuma
one
of
the
ablest
of
the
statesmen
of
the
new
era
made
in
a
novel
and
startling
proposition
it
was
in
a
memorial
addressed
by
him
to
the
emperor
he
proposed
that
the
emperor
should
abandon
the
traditions
which
had
grown
up
respecting
his
person
and
his
court
and
rule
his
empire
with
personal
supervision
to
do
this
successfully
he
recommended
that
the
capital
be
transferred
from
the
place
of
its
degrading
superstitions
to
a
new
home
he
suggested
that
ōsaka
be
the
place
selected
if
the
emperor
s
court
had
been
under
the
same
influences
as
had
governed
it
in
past
years
such
a
proposition
would
have
been
received
with
horror
perhaps
even
the
bold
proposer
would
have
been
deemed
fit
for
the
ceremony
of
but
the
men
who
surrounded
the
emperor
belonged
to
a
different
school
and
the
emperor
himself
although
he
was
still
an
inexperienced
youth
had
already
begun
to
breathe
the
freer
air
of
a
new
life
the
proposition
was
welcomed
and
led
to
the
great
change
which
followed
after
discussion
and
consideration
it
was
determined
that
the
emperor
should
make
his
residence
not
in
ōsaka
which
would
have
been
a
great
and
impressive
change
but
in
yedo
where
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
family
of
ieyasu
had
wielded
the
destinies
of
the
empire
by
this
change
more
than
any
other
was
emphasized
the
fact
that
hereafter
the
executive
as
well
as
the
ultimate
power
was
to
be
found
in
the
same
imperial
hands
acting
on
these
principles
the
emperor
followed
his
victorious
army
and
november
arrived
at
yedo
and
took
up
his
residence
in
the
castle
reports
were
made
to
him
of
the
complete
settlement
of
all
difficulties
in
the
north
and
the
establishment
of
peace
in
token
of
his
arrival
the
name
of
yedo
had
been
changed
to
tōkyō
eastern
capital
by
which
name
it
has
since
been
known
as
a
compensation
to
the
disappointed
and
disheartened
citizens
of
kyōto
their
city
received
the
corresponding
designation
of
saikyō
western
capital
the
which
from
january
had
borne
the
name
of
keiō
had
been
changed
to
enlightened
peace
and
was
fixed
to
begin
from
january
heretofore
the
had
been
changed
whenever
it
seemed
desirable
to
mark
a
fortunate
epoch
but
by
the
edict
establishing
the
it
was
settled
that
hereafter
an
emperor
was
to
make
but
one
change
in
the
during
his
reign
the
emperor
returned
to
the
western
capital
during
the
spring
of
for
a
brief
visit
the
usual
etiquette
of
mourning
for
his
father
required
his
presence
at
the
imperial
tomb
he
also
availed
himself
of
this
visit
to
wed
the
present
empress
who
was
a
princess
of
the
house
of
ichijō
one
of
the
ancient
families
descended
from
the
fujiwara
he
came
back
again
in
april
but
there
was
so
much
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
ancient
capital
to
the
complete
loss
of
their
emperor
that
it
was
deemed
most
prudent
for
the
newly
married
empress
to
remain
behind
she
did
not
set
out
for
tōkyō
to
join
her
husband
until
the
november
following
where
she
arrived
without
incident
a
surprising
reminiscence
of
the
christianity
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
extinguished
in
the
seventeenth
century
came
to
light
in
several
christian
communities
in
the
neighborhood
of
nagasaki
were
discovered
who
had
preserved
their
faith
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
without
priests
without
teachers
almost
without
any
printed
instruction
they
had
kept
alive
by
tradition
through
successive
generations
a
knowledge
of
the
religion
which
their
ancestors
had
professed
these
communities
had
no
doubt
maintained
a
discreet
quiet
as
to
the
tenets
of
their
belief
they
had
a
traditional
fear
of
the
persecution
to
which
their
fathers
had
been
subjected
and
sought
by
silence
to
remain
undisturbed
it
was
the
rejoicing
at
their
discovery
which
directed
the
attention
of
the
government
to
the
fire
which
had
been
so
long
smouldering
a
new
edict
of
the
imperial
government
displayed
upon
the
public
in
first
called
the
notice
of
the
foreign
representatives
to
the
measures
which
were
being
taken
it
was
as
follows
the
evil
sect
called
christian
is
strictly
prohibited
suspicious
persons
should
be
reported
to
the
proper
officers
and
rewards
will
be
nearly
all
the
ministers
of
foreign
powers
remonstrated
against
this
proclamation
as
throwing
discredit
on
the
religions
of
their
countries
the
japanese
officials
defended
the
punishment
of
christians
by
alleging
the
national
prejudice
against
them
which
had
come
from
the
preceding
centuries
they
argued
that
the
question
was
one
of
purely
domestic
concern
of
which
foreign
nations
could
have
no
adequate
knowledge
and
in
which
they
had
no
right
to
interfere
the
christians
chiefly
lived
in
urakami
a
village
near
nagasaki
they
were
said
to
number
about
four
thousand
orders
were
sent
by
the
government
from
tōkyō
in
june
that
all
the
families
who
would
not
recant
should
be
deported
and
put
in
the
charge
of
daimyōs
in
different
provinces
only
a
small
part
of
the
christians
were
thus
exiled
the
government
probably
dealt
with
greater
leniency
because
they
found
the
treaty
powers
so
deeply
interested
subsequently
the
measures
taken
against
the
native
christians
were
withdrawn
in
march
those
who
had
been
dispersed
among
the
daimyōs
were
granted
permission
to
return
to
their
homes
and
persecution
for
religious
belief
was
ended
forever
on
april
before
his
court
and
an
assembly
of
daimyōs
the
emperor
took
what
has
been
called
the
charter
oath
in
five
articles
in
substance
as
follows
a
deliberative
assembly
shall
be
formed
and
all
measures
decided
by
public
opinion
the
principles
of
social
and
political
economics
should
be
diligently
studied
by
both
the
superior
and
inferior
classes
of
our
people
every
one
in
the
community
shall
be
assisted
to
persevere
in
carrying
out
his
will
for
all
good
purposes
all
the
absurd
usages
of
former
times
should
be
disregarded
and
the
impartiality
and
justice
displayed
in
the
workings
of
nature
be
adopted
as
the
basis
of
action
wisdom
and
ability
should
be
sought
after
in
all
quarters
of
the
world
for
the
purpose
of
firmly
establishing
the
foundations
of
the
empire
the
promise
in
the
first
article
to
establish
a
deliberative
assembly
was
watched
with
the
greatest
solicitude
and
when
during
the
same
year
the
parliament
was
called
together
great
hopes
were
entertained
of
its
usefulness
it
was
composed
of
persons
representing
each
of
the
daimiates
who
were
chosen
for
the
position
by
the
daimyōs
it
was
a
quiet
peaceful
debating
society
whose
function
was
to
give
advice
to
the
imperial
government
that
it
was
a
thoroughly
conservative
body
is
apparent
from
the
result
of
its
discussion
upon
several
of
the
traditional
customs
of
japan
on
the
proposition
to
recommend
the
abolition
of
the
privilege
of
the
vote
stood
ayes
noes
and
not
voting
on
the
proposition
to
abolish
the
wearing
of
swords
which
was
introduced
and
advocated
by
mori
arinori
the
final
vote
was
unanimously
against
it
in
a
house
of
after
a
short
and
uneventful
career
the
was
dissolved
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
in
which
it
was
summoned
it
had
been
a
step
but
not
a
very
important
step
in
the
direction
of
parliamentary
government
we
must
now
give
an
account
of
the
most
remarkable
event
in
the
modern
history
of
japan
we
refer
to
the
termination
of
feudalism
by
the
voluntary
surrender
of
their
feudal
rights
on
the
part
of
the
daimyōs
this
action
was
a
logical
consequence
of
the
restoration
of
the
executive
power
into
the
hands
of
the
emperor
it
was
felt
by
the
statesmen
of
this
period
that
in
order
to
secure
a
government
which
could
grapple
successfully
with
the
many
questions
which
would
press
upon
it
there
must
be
a
centralization
of
the
powers
which
were
now
distributed
among
the
powerful
daimyōs
of
the
empire
to
bring
this
about
by
force
was
impossible
to
discover
among
the
princes
a
willingness
to
give
up
their
hereditary
privileges
and
come
down
to
the
position
of
a
powerless
aristocracy
was
something
for
which
we
have
hitherto
looked
in
vain
illustration
mori
arinori
doubtless
the
condition
of
nearly
all
the
daimyōs
at
this
time
made
the
accomplishment
of
this
event
more
easy
with
only
a
few
exceptions
the
hereditary
princes
of
the
provinces
had
come
to
be
merely
the
formal
chiefs
of
their
daimiates
the
real
power
was
in
the
hands
of
the
energetic
and
capable
who
were
employed
to
manage
the
affairs
they
saw
that
any
scheme
for
transferring
the
political
authority
of
the
daimyōs
to
the
central
government
would
render
more
important
their
services
they
would
become
not
merely
the
formal
administrative
functionaries
but
the
real
officers
to
whom
responsible
duties
and
trusts
would
be
confided
some
of
this
class
of
subordinates
had
already
in
the
new
imperial
government
tasted
the
savoriness
of
this
kind
of
service
and
they
were
ready
to
carry
out
a
plan
which
seemed
to
have
patriotism
and
practicability
in
its
favor
the
most
notable
circumstance
in
this
series
of
events
was
the
presentation
to
the
emperor
of
an
elaborate
memorial
signed
by
the
daimyōs
of
chōshū
satsuma
tosa
hizen
kaga
and
others
offering
him
the
lists
of
their
possessions
and
men
this
memorial
appeared
in
the
official
gazette
march
its
preparation
is
attributed
to
kido
takayoshi
and
bears
supreme
evidence
to
his
learning
and
statesmanship
with
lofty
eloquence
the
memorial
exclaims
the
place
where
we
live
is
the
emperor
s
land
and
the
food
which
we
eat
is
grown
by
the
emperor
s
men
how
can
we
make
it
our
own
we
now
reverently
offer
up
the
lists
of
our
possessions
and
men
with
the
prayer
that
the
emperor
will
take
good
measures
for
rewarding
those
to
whom
reward
is
due
and
taking
from
those
to
whom
punishment
is
due
let
the
imperial
orders
be
issued
for
altering
and
remodelling
the
territories
of
the
various
classes
this
is
now
the
most
urgent
duty
of
the
emperor
as
it
is
that
of
his
servants
and
the
example
thus
set
by
the
most
powerful
and
influential
daimyōs
was
followed
rapidly
by
others
two
hundred
and
of
the
daimyōs
united
in
asking
the
emperor
to
take
back
their
hereditary
territories
and
in
the
end
only
a
small
number
remained
who
had
not
so
petitioned
prince
azuki
in
his
memorial
says
let
them
restore
the
territories
which
they
have
received
from
the
emperor
and
return
to
a
constitutional
and
undivided
country
let
them
abandon
their
titles
and
under
the
name
of
persons
of
honor
receive
such
properties
as
may
serve
for
their
wants
let
the
officers
of
the
clans
abandoning
that
title
call
themselves
officers
of
the
emperor
receiving
property
equal
to
that
which
they
have
hitherto
in
response
to
these
memorials
a
decree
was
issued
by
the
emperor
august
announcing
the
abolition
of
the
daimiates
and
the
restoration
of
their
revenues
to
the
imperial
treasury
it
was
also
decreed
that
the
ranks
of
court
nobles
and
of
daimyōs
be
abolished
and
the
single
rank
of
be
substituted
thus
at
one
stroke
the
whole
institution
of
feudalism
which
had
flourished
from
the
time
of
yoritomo
was
cut
away
the
government
made
provision
for
the
administration
by
creating
prefectures
to
take
the
place
of
daimiates
this
was
done
in
at
first
the
daimyōs
were
appointed
governors
of
the
prefectures
but
it
was
soon
found
that
these
hereditary
princes
were
as
a
class
utterly
unfit
for
the
chief
executive
offices
of
their
old
provinces
hence
one
by
one
other
competent
persons
were
appointed
to
vacancies
until
it
came
to
be
understood
that
competence
and
fitness
were
to
be
the
requisite
qualifications
for
such
appointments
the
financial
questions
involved
in
the
suppression
of
the
feudal
system
were
serious
and
difficult
when
the
daimyōs
surrendered
their
fiefs
they
did
so
with
the
understanding
that
they
themselves
should
receive
such
properties
as
may
serve
their
wants
and
that
the
emperor
should
take
measures
for
rewarding
those
to
whom
reward
is
it
was
decided
that
each
and
each
of
the
suzerains
that
were
dependent
on
him
should
receive
one
tenth
of
the
amount
of
their
income
from
their
fiefs
the
received
this
amount
free
of
any
claims
upon
them
for
the
support
of
the
who
formed
the
standing
armies
of
each
clan
the
central
government
assumed
all
the
payments
to
the
for
services
of
whatever
kind
this
heavy
charge
of
the
government
was
met
by
borrowing
which
was
added
to
the
national
debt
with
this
sum
they
undertook
to
capitalize
the
pensions
which
was
finally
accomplished
by
a
compulsory
enactment
each
claimant
received
from
the
government
bonds
for
the
amount
of
his
income
reckoned
at
from
five
to
fourteen
years
purchase
according
to
its
sum
thus
to
the
great
relief
of
the
country
the
matter
of
pensions
was
disposed
of
to
many
of
the
this
summary
settlement
had
unfortunate
results
the
lump
sums
which
they
received
were
often
soon
consumed
and
they
were
left
penniless
and
helpless
the
traditions
under
which
they
had
been
trained
led
them
to
look
down
upon
labor
and
trade
with
disdain
and
rendered
them
unfit
to
enter
successfully
on
the
careers
of
modern
life
in
many
cases
worry
and
disappointment
and
in
others
poverty
and
want
have
been
the
sequels
which
have
closely
followed
the
poor
and
obsolete
several
minor
but
noteworthy
steps
in
reform
were
taken
the
ancient
disqualifications
of
the
and
were
removed
in
and
these
pariahs
placed
on
the
same
legal
footing
as
the
rest
of
the
population
the
first
railway
in
japan
was
opened
between
yokohama
and
tōkyō
in
the
european
calendar
so
far
as
it
regarded
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
the
beginning
of
the
months
was
adopted
in
the
year
was
still
counted
from
jimmu
tennō
of
the
christian
era
corresponding
to
of
the
japanese
era
and
also
by
the
the
commencement
of
which
was
from
several
international
events
deserve
notice
here
a
number
of
ryūkyū
islanders
vassals
of
japan
had
been
shipwrecked
on
formosa
and
some
killed
by
the
inhabitants
to
punish
this
cruelty
and
to
insure
a
more
humane
treatment
in
the
future
the
japanese
government
sent
an
expedition
under
general
saigō
tsugumichi
they
made
short
work
of
the
inhuman
tribes
and
enforced
upon
them
the
lesson
of
civility
china
who
claimed
a
sovereignty
over
this
island
acknowledged
the
service
japan
had
rendered
and
agreed
to
pay
an
indemnity
for
the
expenses
of
the
expedition
the
dispute
between
russia
and
japan
concerning
the
boundary
in
saghalien
was
settled
in
by
a
treaty
which
exchanged
the
japanese
claims
in
saghalien
for
the
kurile
islands
chishima
an
unexpected
attack
by
the
koreans
upon
a
japanese
steamer
asking
coal
and
provisions
awakened
an
intense
excitement
in
japan
an
expedition
after
the
pattern
of
commodore
perry
s
under
the
command
of
general
kuroda
kiyotaka
was
despatched
in
january
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
koreans
the
negotiations
were
entirely
successful
and
a
treaty
of
amity
and
commerce
was
concluded
and
thus
another
of
the
secluded
kingdoms
of
the
east
had
been
brought
into
the
comity
of
nations
then
outbreaks
of
this
kind
in
saga
in
higo
in
akizuki
and
in
chōshū
occurred
but
they
were
all
put
down
without
difficulty
or
delay
the
promptness
with
which
the
government
dealt
with
these
factions
boded
no
good
to
the
reactionary
movements
that
were
ready
to
break
out
in
other
places
although
the
satsuma
clan
had
taken
the
most
prominent
part
in
the
destruction
of
the
shōgunate
and
in
the
restoration
of
an
imperial
government
there
was
in
it
a
greater
amount
of
conservatism
and
opposition
to
modern
innovations
than
was
to
be
found
elsewhere
indeed
the
clan
had
split
into
two
distinct
parties
the
one
aiding
in
all
the
reforms
and
changes
which
the
government
was
attempting
to
carry
out
the
other
holding
resolutely
to
the
old
feudal
traditions
which
they
saw
endangered
by
the
present
attitude
of
the
emperor
s
counsellors
the
latter
party
had
for
its
leaders
shimazu
saburō
and
saigō
takamori
both
of
whom
had
played
conspicuous
parts
in
the
recent
history
of
their
country
the
government
had
tried
to
conciliate
these
two
influential
men
and
to
secure
their
in
the
administration
but
both
had
retired
from
tōkyō
and
declined
longer
to
share
the
responsibility
of
a
course
which
they
could
not
approve
saigō
who
was
the
idol
of
the
after
his
retirement
established
near
kagoshima
a
military
school
where
the
young
men
of
that
class
were
drilled
in
the
duties
of
the
army
branch
schools
on
the
same
model
were
also
carried
on
in
several
other
places
in
the
province
in
all
it
was
said
that
not
less
than
young
were
receiving
a
training
in
these
dangerous
schools
they
were
filled
with
the
most
violent
antipathy
to
the
government
and
were
with
difficulty
restrained
even
by
their
leaders
from
outbreaks
in
sympathy
with
the
uprisings
which
elsewhere
were
taking
place
the
government
was
naturally
solicitous
concerning
these
collections
of
inflammable
material
a
collision
with
the
students
over
the
removal
of
some
stores
of
arms
and
ammunition
revealed
their
readiness
to
break
into
rebellion
it
is
not
improbable
that
designing
conspirators
took
advantage
of
the
open
and
chivalric
character
of
saigō
to
push
him
into
the
initiation
of
hostilities
admiral
kawamura
himself
a
satsuma
man
and
a
connection
of
saigō
was
sent
down
to
hold
an
interview
with
him
and
if
possible
to
make
a
peaceful
settlement
but
the
interview
was
declined
the
rebellious
elements
were
at
once
gathered
together
and
saigō
at
the
head
of
a
force
of
men
started
about
the
middle
of
february
on
his
march
up
the
west
coast
of
kyūshū
on
his
way
to
tōkyō
the
conspirators
estimated
that
a
force
of
troops
could
be
counted
on
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
the
first
impediment
in
their
march
was
the
castle
of
kumamoto
where
the
government
had
a
garrison
of
to
men
under
general
tani
saigō
determined
to
reduce
it
before
making
further
progress
he
spent
several
weeks
in
this
vain
attempt
this
was
a
precious
delay
for
the
government
which
it
spent
in
organizing
and
sending
forward
troops
for
opposing
the
advance
of
the
rebels
all
available
forces
were
collected
and
put
in
motion
to
the
seat
of
war
prince
was
appointed
and
established
his
headquarters
at
fukuoka
the
equipment
of
troops
at
the
seat
of
government
was
under
the
supervision
of
general
saigō
tsugumichi
a
younger
brother
of
the
rebel
leader
loyal
as
he
was
to
his
emperor
it
was
a
painful
task
for
him
to
organize
war
against
his
brother
with
native
delicacy
he
left
to
others
the
duty
of
fighting
on
the
field
and
confined
himself
to
the
less
conspicuous
part
of
gathering
and
sending
troops
as
they
were
needed
the
rebels
had
besieged
kumamoto
and
had
already
reduced
it
to
great
straits
but
the
imperial
forces
came
in
time
to
its
relief
there
was
desperate
fighting
but
at
last
the
besiegers
were
compelled
to
withdraw
they
retreated
toward
the
east
coast
with
the
apparent
purpose
of
seeking
a
way
to
the
north
by
hyūga
and
bungo
promptly
they
were
followed
and
confined
to
a
defensive
attitude
the
most
desperate
battles
were
fought
in
this
part
of
the
campaign
though
disappointed
and
outnumbered
the
rebels
fought
with
consummate
bravery
they
were
almost
in
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
where
their
celestial
ancestor
was
fabled
to
have
descended
upon
the
japanese
islands
their
last
stand
was
at
nobeoka
in
the
northeast
corner
of
hyūga
their
leaders
realized
that
to
continue
the
contest
would
only
cause
unnecessary
and
hopeless
slaughter
under
these
circumstances
saigō
saw
that
to
end
the
fighting
and
save
his
followers
he
must
leave
them
accordingly
with
about
two
hundred
of
those
who
were
personally
devoted
to
him
he
broke
through
the
imperial
line
and
escaped
to
kagoshima
the
army
finding
they
were
forsaken
surrendered
august
saigō
with
his
little
band
entrenched
himself
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
shiroyama
overlooking
kagoshima
here
he
was
surrounded
by
the
imperial
forces
and
bombarded
night
and
day
the
veteran
leader
was
at
last
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
seeing
that
all
hope
of
escape
was
gone
he
requested
one
of
his
lieutenants
to
perform
for
him
the
friendly
office
of
severing
his
head
from
his
body
after
the
capture
of
the
stronghold
the
bodies
of
saigō
and
his
comrades
were
discovered
admiral
kawamura
himself
with
tender
hands
washed
the
bloody
head
of
his
dead
friend
and
saw
that
the
bodies
of
all
were
decently
buried
thus
on
september
the
last
and
most
serious
of
the
attempts
which
have
been
made
to
disturb
the
empire
in
its
new
career
came
to
an
end
there
was
however
one
mournful
sequel
to
this
rebellion
ōkubo
toshimichi
a
statesman
and
patriot
of
the
purest
type
had
from
the
beginning
resisted
the
reactionary
movements
of
his
clan
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
he
was
minister
of
home
affairs
and
put
forth
all
his
exertions
to
suppress
it
a
baseless
slander
that
he
had
sent
to
satsuma
hired
assassins
to
take
saigō
s
life
had
been
used
by
the
reckless
conspirators
to
force
the
rebel
leader
to
an
outbreak
this
was
believed
by
many
of
the
not
only
in
satsuma
but
in
other
provinces
on
may
tōkyō
was
startled
by
the
news
that
ōkubo
while
driving
through
a
secluded
spot
in
the
old
castle
grounds
on
his
way
to
the
emperor
s
palace
had
been
murdered
the
assassins
were
from
the
province
of
kaga
and
gave
as
the
reason
for
their
crime
their
desire
to
avenge
the
death
of
saigō
japan
could
ill
afford
to
spare
at
this
time
her
most
statesman
and
her
noblest
and
most
unflinching
patriot
illustration
okubo
toshimichi
what
followed
these
important
events
must
be
told
in
a
summary
manner
there
was
a
powerful
and
growing
party
in
the
empire
who
looked
forward
to
a
modification
of
the
absolute
form
of
government
to
which
they
had
returned
in
this
party
was
particularly
aggressive
in
the
province
of
tosa
they
recalled
to
themselves
and
others
the
solemn
pledge
which
the
emperor
had
given
to
his
people
in
his
charter
oath
when
he
announced
that
a
deliberative
assembly
shall
be
formed
and
all
measures
decided
by
public
the
ruling
minds
in
the
government
feared
that
the
people
were
too
inexperienced
and
too
unaccustomed
to
deciding
and
acting
for
themselves
to
be
entrusted
with
the
grave
duty
of
constitutional
government
as
a
preparation
for
so
important
a
step
local
assemblies
were
authorized
and
established
in
matters
referring
to
the
government
of
each
and
were
to
be
discussed
and
to
a
certain
extent
decided
in
these
assemblies
it
was
believed
that
the
experience
gained
in
such
bodies
would
go
far
towards
preparing
men
for
service
in
an
imperial
legislative
body
the
expectations
founded
on
these
local
assemblies
were
realized
and
in
a
fair
degree
they
continued
to
fulfil
their
purpose
in
further
pursuance
of
the
plan
of
constitutional
government
the
emperor
on
february
at
his
palace
promulgated
a
constitution
for
his
people
in
the
presence
of
his
cabinet
and
court
he
took
a
solemn
oath
to
govern
under
its
limitations
and
powers
this
constitution
contains
seven
chapters
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
eleven
articles
chapter

the
emperor
ii
rights
and
duties
of

iii
the

the
emperor
also
announced
that
the
imperial
diet
would
be
convoked
in
the
year
of
and
that
the
constitution
would
go
into
effect
at
the
date
of
its
assembling

it
would
seem
that
no
great
advance
can
be
secured
in
japan
without
the
sacrifice
of
a
valuable
life
as
ii
was
murdered
in
and
as
ōkubo
fell
by
the
assassin
s
hand
at
the
close
of
the
satsuma
rebellion
so
now
on
the
very
day
when
the
emperor
was
to
promulgate
this
liberal
constitution
viscount
mori
arinori
fell
a
victim
to
the
fanatical
hatred
of
one
who
looked
with
distrust
upon
the
progress
which
his
country
was
making
no
one
could
look
or
did
look
on
this
progress
with
more
interest
than
mori
he
had
so
long
and
so
earnestly
advocated
a
liberal
and
tolerant
policy
in
the
councils
of
his
country
and
had
been
a
leader
in
all
that
was
high
and
noble
that
we
can
not
regard
except
with
profound
regret

taishi
from
vol

to
shall
be
esteemed
and
obedience
shall
be
held
in
regard
because
dissensions
prevail
therefore
men
are
often
unfaithful
to
their
prince
and
disobedient
to
their
fathers
let
adjoining
districts
be
left
in
peace
thus
harmony
between
superior
and
inferior
shall
be
cultivated
and
in
matters
of
state
shall
be
promoted
and
thus
the
right
reason
of
all
things
may
be
reached
and
the
right
thing
accomplished
bountiful
honor
be
always
paid
to
the
three
precious
elements
of
buddhism
that
is
to
its
priests
its
ritual
and
its
founder
it
is
the
highest
religion
in
the
universe
and
all
people
in
all
generations
must
pay
becoming
reverence
to
its
doctrines
do
not
harshly
censure
men
s
wickedness
but
teach
them
faithfully
until
they
yield
obedience
unless
men
rely
upon
buddhism
there
is
no
way
to
convert
them
from
the
wrong
to
the
right
the
commands
of
the
emperor
men
must
be
duly
obedient
the
prince
must
be
looked
upon
as
the
heaven
and
his
subjects
as
the
earth
the
earth
contains
all
things
and
the
heaven
stretches
over
it
the
four
seasons
pass
orderly
along
and
the
spirit
of
the
universe
is
harmonious
if
the
earth
were
to
cover
the
heaven
the
effect
would
be
distraction
hence
the
prince
must
command
and
the
subject
obey
superiors
must
act
and
inferiors
yield
men
ought
therefore
to
pay
due
heed
to
the
orders
of
the
emperor
if
not
they
will
bring
ruin
on
themselves
must
be
the
chief
rule
of
conduct
for
all
officers
and
their
colleagues
in
the
court
the
first
principle
governing
subjects
must
be
politeness
when
superiors
are
not
polite
then
inferiors
will
not
keep
in
the
right
when
inferiors
are
not
polite
their
conduct
degenerates
into
crime
when
both
prince
and
subjects
are
polite
then
social
order
is
never
disturbed
and
the
state
is
kept
in
a
condition
of
tranquillity
and
rapacity
must
be
expelled
from
the
hearts
of
officers
and
they
must
adjudicate
with
just
discrimination
in
all
suits
that
come
before
them
even
in
a
single
day
there
are
thousands
of
such
suits
and
in
the
course
of
years
how
great
must
be
the
accumulation
if
the
suit
is
won
through
bribery
then
the
poor
man
can
obtain
no
justice
but
only
the
rich
the
poor
man
will
have
no
sure
place
of
dependence
and
subjects
will
be
driven
to
abandon
their
duty
punish
vice
and
to
encourage
virtue
is
the
rule
in
good
ancient
law
the
virtuous
man
must
therefore
be
promoted
and
the
vicious
man
must
be
surely
punished
the
man
who
is
untruthful
is
a
powerful
instrument
to
endanger
the
state
and
a
keen
weapon
to
destroy
the
nation
the
flatterer
loves
to
tell
the
faults
of
the
inferior
to
the
superior
and
also
to
disclose
the
errors
of
the
superior
to
the
inferior
such
men
are
alike
unfaithful
to
the
prince
and
unfriendly
to
fellow
citizens
and
in
the
end
fail
not
to
stir
up
social
disorder
duty
of
men
in
the
government
must
be
assigned
according
to
their
capacity
when
intelligent
men
take
service
the
applause
of
the
people
follows
but
when
bad
men
are
in
office
calamities
ensue
if
wise
officers
are
put
on
duty
the
matters
of
state
are
well
managed
and
the
community
is
free
from
danger
and
prosperity
prevails
therefore
in
ancient
times
the
wise
king
never
selected
the
office
for
the
man
but
always
selected
the
man
to
suit
the
office
often
officers
and
their
colleagues
come
early
to
their
offices
and
retire
soon
so
that
the
public
work
accomplished
in
a
single
day
is
small
it
is
incumbent
on
them
to
devote
sufficient
time
to
their
tasks
if
not
then
the
work
of
the
government
can
not
be
done
must
be
faithfully
done
because
fidelity
is
the
origin
of
justice
the
distinction
between
good
and
bad
between
success
and
failure
depends
on
fidelity
when
both
prince
and
subjects
are
faithful
then
there
are
no
duties
which
can
not
be
accomplished
but
when
both
are
unfaithful
nothing
can
be
done
up
all
thoughts
of
indignation
and
be
not
angered
with
others
on
account
of
a
disagreement
of
opinion
each
one
may
have
a
different
point
of
view
and
may
therefore
come
to
a
different
conclusion
if
the
one
side
be
right
then
the
other
must
be
wrong
or
the
cases
may
be
just
reversed
it
would
be
unjust
to
set
down
one
man
as
surely
wise
and
another
as
positively
stupid
because
men
can
not
attain
perfection
in
their
characters
it
is
impossible
to
decide
either
side
to
be
perfectly
right
or
perfectly
wrong
while
you
are
angry
with
another
who
has
a
different
view
from
you
you
can
not
be
sure
lest
you
be
in
the
wrong
therefore
though
you
may
think
yourself
in
the
right
it
is
safer
to
follow
the
opinions
of
the
many
merit
and
demerit
be
carefully
considered
and
let
rewards
and
punishments
be
meted
out
accordingly
in
times
past
this
has
often
failed
to
be
justly
done
it
is
incumbent
on
all
who
are
entrusted
with
the
direction
of
public
affairs
and
on
all
officers
of
the
government
to
look
carefully
after
the
distribution
of
rewards
and
punishments
of
provinces
and
their
deputies
must
be
careful
not
to
impose
too
heavy
duties
on
their
subjects
one
state
never
has
more
than
one
prince
and
in
like
manner
the
subjects
can
not
have
more
than
one
master
the
prince
is
the
head
of
all
his
dominions
and
of
all
his
subjects
the
officers
of
government
are
also
the
subjects
of
the
prince
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
dare
to
lay
undue
burdens
upon
others
who
are
subjects
of
the
same
prince
officer
of
the
government
has
his
appointed
duty
sometimes
officers
complain
of
the
stagnation
of
business
which
however
is
caused
by
their
own
absence
from
their
appointed
duties
they
must
not
make
a
pretence
of
the
performance
of
their
duties
and
by
their
neglect
interrupt
public
affairs
and
officers
must
not
be
jealous
of
each
other
if
one
person
is
envious
of
another
the
second
is
sure
to
be
envious
of
the
first
thus
the
evils
of
jealousy
never
end
if
men
shall
envy
each
other
on
account
of
their
talent
and
wisdom
no
single
wise
man
would
ever
be
obtained
for
government
service
through
a
thousand
years
what
a
noble
method
of
governing
a
state
would
that
be
which
expelled
from
its
service
all
wise
men
sacrifice
private
interests
for
the
public
good
is
the
duty
of
the
subject
when
men
are
selfish
there
must
be
when
comes
then
with
it
must
come
iniquity
which
will
disturb
the
public
welfare
is
sure
to
bring
about
the
breaking
of
wholesome
rules
and
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
state
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
harmony
between
superior
and
inferior
spoken
of
in
the
first
article
is
so
important
select
a
convenient
season
in
which
to
employ
men
for
public
work
is
the
rule
of
good
ancient
law
winter
is
a
time
of
leisure
but
during
the
season
between
spring
and
autumn
in
which
they
are
employed
on
their
farms
and
in
feeding
it
is
not
expedient
to
take
men
from
their
work
or
interfere
with
them
in
their
efforts
to
supply
food
and
clothing
matters
should
only
be
settled
after
due
conference
with
many
men
trifling
matters
may
be
decided
without
conference
because
they
are
not
so
material
in
their
effects
but
weighty
matters
on
account
of
their
consequences
must
be
discussed
with
many
councillors
it
is
thus
that
the
right
way
shall
be
found
and
pursued

its

contrary
to

yielded
to
him

as
his
faithful

the
legend
of
benkei
stealing

it

flee

he
came
with
benkei
both
disguised
as
begging
priests
to
a
guarded
barrier
the
custodians
refused
them
passage
but
benkei
who
was
cunning
as
well
as
strong
pulled
out
from
his
bosom
a
roll
of
blank
paper
and
pretended
to
read
a
commission
from
the
abbot
of
hōkōji
in
kyōto
authorizing
the
two
travellers
to
collect
funds
throughout
the
country
for
casting
a
great
bell
for
their
temple
the
custodians
were
deeply
impressed
with
this
holy
message

allowed
the
travellers
to
pass
without
further
question
there
are
many
legends

rev
john

who

lived

among

of
the
opinion
that
this
reverence
is
largely
due
to
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
ainos
to
conciliate
their
japanese
masters
it
has
seemed
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
the
traditions
concerning
yoshitsuné
among
the
ainos
have
been
carried
from
the
main
island
by
the
retreating
tribes

that
yoshitsuné
