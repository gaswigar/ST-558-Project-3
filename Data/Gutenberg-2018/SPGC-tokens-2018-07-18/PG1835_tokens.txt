the
case
of
the
pool
of
blood
in
the
pastor
s
study

colbron
and
augusta
groner
introduction
to
joe
muller
joseph
muller
secret
service
detective
of
the
imperial
austrian
police
is
one
of
the
great
experts
in
his
profession
in
personality
he
differs
greatly
from
other
famous
detectives
he
has
neither
the
impressive
authority
of
sherlock
holmes
nor
the
keen
brilliancy
of
monsieur
lecoq
muller
is
a
small
slight
man
of
indefinite
age
and
of
much
humbleness
of
mien
a
naturally
retiring
modest
disposition
and
two
external
causes
are
the
reasons
for
muller
s
humbleness
of
manner
which
is
his
chief
characteristic
one
cause
is
the
fact
that
in
early
youth
a
miscarriage
of
justice
gave
him
several
years
in
prison
an
experience
which
cast
a
stigma
on
his
name
and
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
for
many
years
after
to
obtain
honest
employment
but
the
world
is
richer
and
safer
by
muller
s
early
misfortune
for
it
was
this
experience
which
threw
him
back
on
his
own
peculiar
talents
for
a
livelihood
and
drove
him
into
the
police
force
had
he
been
able
to
enter
any
other
profession
his
genius
might
have
been
stunted
to
a
mere
pastime
instead
of
being
as
now
utilised
for
the
public
good
then
the
red
tape
and
bureaucratic
etiquette
which
attaches
to
every
governmental
department
puts
the
secret
service
men
of
the
imperial
police
on
a
par
with
the
lower
ranks
of
the
subordinates
muller
s
official
rank
is
scarcely
much
higher
than
that
of
a
policeman
although
kings
and
councillors
consult
him
and
the
police
department
realises
to
the
full
what
a
treasure
it
has
in
him
but
official
red
tape
and
his
early
misfortune
prevent
the
giving
of
any
higher
official
standing
to
even
such
a
genius
born
and
bred
to
such
conditions
muller
understands
them
and
his
natural
modesty
of
disposition
asks
for
no
outward
honours
asks
for
nothing
but
an
income
sufficient
for
his
simple
needs
and
for
aid
and
opportunity
to
occupy
himself
in
the
way
he
most
enjoys
joseph
muller
s
character
is
a
strange
mixture
the
man
in
the
world
he
is
a
human
bloodhound
when
once
the
lure
of
the
trail
has
caught
him
he
scarcely
eats
or
sleeps
when
the
chase
is
on
he
does
not
seem
to
know
human
weakness
nor
fatigue
in
spite
of
his
frail
body
once
put
on
a
case
his
mind
delves
and
delves
until
it
finds
a
clue
then
something
awakes
within
him
a
spirit
akin
to
that
which
holds
the
bloodhound
nose
to
trail
and
he
will
accomplish
the
apparently
impossible
he
will
track
down
his
victim
when
the
entire
machinery
of
a
great
police
department
seems
helpless
to
discover
anything
the
high
chiefs
and
commissioners
grant
a
condescending
permission
when
muller
asks
may
i
do
this
or
may
i
handle
this
case
this
way
both
parties
knowing
all
the
while
that
it
is
a
farce
and
that
the
department
waits
helpless
until
this
humble
little
man
saves
its
honour
by
solving
some
problem
before
which
its
intricate
machinery
has
stood
dazed
and
puzzled
this
call
of
the
trail
is
something
that
is
stronger
than
anything
else
in
muller
s
mentality
and
now
and
then
it
brings
him
into
conflict
with
the
department
or
with
his
own
better
nature
sometimes
his
unerring
instinct
discovers
secrets
in
high
places
secrets
which
the
police
department
is
bidden
to
hush
up
and
leave
untouched
muller
is
then
taken
off
the
case
and
left
idle
for
a
while
if
he
persists
in
his
opinion
as
to
the
true
facts
and
at
other
times
muller
s
own
warm
heart
gets
him
into
trouble
he
will
track
down
his
victim
driven
by
the
power
in
his
soul
which
is
stronger
than
all
volition
but
when
he
has
this
victim
in
the
net
he
will
sometimes
discover
him
to
be
a
much
finer
better
man
than
the
other
individual
whose
wrong
at
this
particular
criminal
s
hand
set
in
motion
the
machinery
of
justice
several
times
that
has
happened
to
muller
and
each
time
his
heart
got
the
better
of
his
professional
instincts
of
his
practical
too
perhaps
at
least
as
far
as
his
own
advancement
was
concerned
and
he
warned
the
victim
defeating
his
own
work
this
peculiarity
of
muller
s
character
caused
his
undoing
at
last
his
official
undoing
that
is
and
compelled
his
retirement
from
the
force
but
his
advice
is
often
sought
unofficially
by
the
department
and
to
those
who
know
muller
s
hand
can
be
seen
in
the
unravelling
of
many
a
famous
case
the
following
stories
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
interesting
cases
that
have
come
within
the
experience
of
this
great
detective
but
they
give
a
fair
portrayal
of
muller
s
peculiar
method
of
working
his
looking
on
himself
as
merely
an
humble
member
of
the
department
and
the
comedy
of
his
acting
under
official
orders
when
the
department
is
in
reality
following
out
his
directions
joe
muller
detective
the
case
of
the
pool
of
blood
in
the
pastor
s
study
the
sun
rose
slowly
over
the
great
bulk
of
the
carpathian
mountains
lying
along
the
horizon
weird
giant
shapes
in
the
early
morning
mist
it
was
still
very
quiet
in
the
village
a
cock
crowed
here
and
there
and
swallows
flew
chirping
close
to
the
ground
darting
swiftly
about
preparing
for
their
higher
flight
janci
the
shepherd
apparently
the
only
human
being
already
up
stood
beside
the
brook
at
the
point
where
the
old
bridge
spans
the
streamlet
still
turbulent
from
the
mountain
floods
janci
was
cutting
willows
to
make
his
margit
a
new
basket
once
the
shepherd
raised
his
head
from
his
work
for
he
thought
he
heard
a
loud
laugh
somewhere
in
the
near
distance
but
all
seemed
silent
and
he
turned
back
to
his
willows
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
about
him
was
much
too
familiar
a
thing
that
he
should
have
felt
or
seen
its
charm
the
violet
hue
of
the
distant
woods
the
red
gleaming
of
the
moor
with
its
patches
of
swamp
from
which
the
slow
mist
arose
the
pretty
little
village
with
its
handsome
old
church
and
attractive
rectory
janci
had
known
it
so
long
that
he
never
stopped
to
realise
how
very
charming
in
its
gentle
melancholy
it
all
was
also
janci
did
not
know
that
this
little
village
of
his
home
had
once
been
a
flourishing
city
and
that
an
invasion
of
the
turks
had
razed
it
to
the
ground
leaving
as
by
a
miracle
only
the
church
to
tell
of
former
glories
the
sun
rose
higher
and
higher
and
now
the
village
awoke
to
its
daily
life
voices
of
cattle
and
noises
of
poultry
were
heard
about
the
houses
and
men
and
women
began
their
accustomed
round
of
tasks
janci
found
that
he
had
gathered
enough
willow
twigs
by
this
time
he
tied
them
in
a
loose
bundle
and
started
on
his
homeward
way
his
path
led
through
fields
and
vineyards
past
a
little
hill
some
distance
from
the
village
on
which
stood
a
large
house
it
was
not
a
pleasant
house
to
look
at
not
a
house
one
would
care
to
live
in
even
if
one
did
not
know
its
use
for
it
looked
bare
and
repellant
covered
with
its
ugly
yellow
paint
and
with
all
the
windows
secured
with
heavy
iron
bars
the
trees
that
surrounded
it
were
tall
and
casting
an
added
gloom
over
the
forbidding
appearance
of
the
house
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
high
iron
fence
cutting
off
what
lay
behind
it
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
for
this
ugly
yellow
house
enclosed
in
its
walls
a
goodly
sum
of
hopeless
human
misery
and
misfortune
it
was
an
insane
asylum
for
twenty
years
now
the
asylum
had
stood
on
its
hill
a
source
of
superstitious
terror
to
the
villagers
but
at
the
same
time
a
source
of
added
income
it
meant
money
for
them
for
it
afforded
a
constant
and
market
for
their
farm
products
and
the
output
of
their
home
industry
but
every
now
and
then
a
scream
or
a
harsh
laugh
would
ring
out
from
behind
those
barred
windows
and
those
in
the
village
who
could
hear
would
shiver
and
cross
themselves
shepherd
janci
had
little
fear
of
the
big
house
his
little
hut
cowered
close
by
the
high
iron
gates
and
he
had
a
personal
acquaintance
with
most
of
the
patients
with
all
of
the
attendants
and
most
of
all
with
the
kind
elderly
physician
who
was
the
head
of
the
establishment
janci
knew
them
all
and
had
a
kind
word
equally
for
all
but
otherwise
he
was
a
silent
man
living
much
within
himself
when
the
shepherd
reached
his
little
home
his
wife
came
to
meet
him
with
a
call
to
breakfast
as
they
sat
down
at
the
table
a
shadow
moved
past
the
little
window
janci
looked
up
who
was
that
asked
margit
looking
up
from
her
folded
hands
she
had
just
finished
her
murmured
prayer
pastor
s
liska
replied
janci
indifferently
beginning
his
meal
liska
was
the
local
abbreviation
for
elizabeth
in
such
a
hurry
thought
the
shepherd
s
wife
her
curiosity
would
not
let
her
rest
i
hope
his
reverence
isn
t
ill
again
she
remarked
after
a
while
janci
did
not
hear
her
for
he
was
very
busy
picking
a
fly
out
of
his
milk
cup
do
you
think
liska
was
going
for
the
old
man
began
margit
again
after
a
few
minutes
the
old
man
was
the
name
given
by
the
people
of
the
village
more
as
a
term
of
endearment
than
anything
else
to
the
generally
loved
and
respected
physician
who
was
the
head
of
the
insane
asylum
he
had
become
general
mentor
and
oracle
of
all
the
village
and
was
known
and
loved
by
man
woman
and
child
it
s
possible
answered
janci
his
reverence
didn
t
look
very
well
yesterday
or
maybe
the
old
housekeeper
has
the
gout
janci
gave
a
grunt
which
might
have
meant
anything
the
shepherd
was
a
silent
man
being
alone
so
much
had
taught
him
to
find
his
own
thoughts
sufficient
company
ten
minutes
passed
in
silence
since
margit
s
last
question
then
some
one
went
past
the
window
there
were
two
people
this
time
liska
and
the
old
doctor
they
were
walking
very
fast
running
almost
margit
sprang
up
and
hurried
to
the
door
to
look
after
them
janci
sat
still
in
his
place
but
he
had
laid
aside
his
spoon
and
with
wide
eyes
was
staring
ahead
of
him
murmuring
it
s
the
pastor
this
time
i
saw
him
just
as
i
did
the
shepherd
the
wants
to
see
you
there
s
something
the
matter
with
his
count
a
young
man
came
from
the
other
direction
and
pushed
in
at
the
door
past
margit
who
stood
there
staring
up
the
road
janci
was
so
deep
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
apparently
did
not
hear
the
boy
s
words
at
all
events
he
did
not
answer
them
but
himself
asked
an
unexpected
question
a
question
that
was
not
addressed
to
the
others
in
the
room
but
to
something
out
and
beyond
them
it
was
a
strange
question
and
it
came
from
the
lips
of
a
man
whose
mind
was
not
with
his
body
at
that
moment
whose
mind
saw
what
others
did
not
see
who
will
be
the
next
to
go
and
who
will
be
our
pastor
now
these
were
janci
s
words
what
are
you
talking
about
shepherd
is
it
another
one
of
your
visions
exclaimed
the
young
fellow
who
stood
there
before
him
janci
rubbed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
come
down
to
earth
with
a
start
oh
is
that
you
ferenz
what
do
you
want
of
me
the
boy
gave
his
message
again
and
janci
nodded
and
followed
him
out
of
the
house
but
both
he
and
his
young
companion
were
very
thoughtful
as
they
plodded
along
the
way
the
boy
did
not
dare
to
ask
any
questions
for
he
knew
that
the
shepherd
was
not
likely
to
answer
there
was
a
silent
understanding
among
the
villagers
that
no
one
should
annoy
janci
in
any
way
for
they
stood
in
a
strange
awe
of
him
although
he
was
the
most
mortal
under
the
sun
while
the
shepherd
and
the
boy
walked
toward
the
inn
the
old
doctor
and
liska
had
hurried
onward
to
the
rectory
they
were
met
at
the
door
by
the
aged
housekeeper
who
staggered
down
the
path
wringing
her
hands
unable
to
give
voice
to
anything
but
inarticulate
expressions
of
grief
and
terror
the
rest
of
the
household
and
the
farm
hands
were
gathered
in
a
frightened
group
in
the
great
courtyard
of
the
stately
rectory
which
had
once
been
a
convent
building
the
physician
hurried
up
the
stairs
into
the
pastor
s
apartments
these
were
high
sunny
and
airy
rooms
with
arched
ceilings
deep
window
seats
great
heavy
doors
and
handsomely
ornamented
stoves
the
simple
modern
furniture
appeared
still
more
plain
and
by
contrast
with
the
huge
spaces
of
the
building
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
gendarme
was
standing
beside
the
window
the
man
saluted
the
physician
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
expression
of
hopelessness
the
doctor
returned
a
silent
greeting
and
passed
through
into
the
next
apartment
the
old
man
was
paler
than
usual
and
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
pain
and
surprise
the
same
expression
that
showed
in
the
faces
of
those
gathered
downstairs
the
room
he
now
entered
was
large
like
the
others
the
walls
handsomely
decorated
and
every
corner
of
it
was
flooded
with
sunshine
there
were
two
men
in
this
room
the
village
magistrate
and
the
notary
their
expression
as
they
held
out
their
hands
to
the
doctor
showed
that
his
coming
brought
great
relief
and
there
was
something
else
in
the
room
something
that
drew
the
eyes
of
all
three
of
the
men
immediately
after
their
silent
greeting
this
was
a
great
pool
of
blood
which
lay
as
a
hideous
stain
on
the
otherwise
clean
floor
the
blood
must
have
flowed
from
a
dreadful
wound
from
a
severed
artery
even
the
doctor
thought
there
was
such
a
quantity
of
it
it
had
already
dried
and
darkened
making
its
terrifying
ugliness
the
more
apparent
this
is
the
third
murder
in
two
years
said
the
magistrate
in
a
low
voice
and
the
most
mysterious
of
all
of
them
added
the
clerk
yes
it
is
said
the
doctor
and
there
is
not
a
trace
of
the
body
you
say
or
a
clue
as
to
where
they
might
have
taken
the
dead
or
dying
man
with
these
words
he
looked
carefully
around
the
room
but
there
was
no
more
blood
to
be
seen
anywhere
any
spot
would
have
been
clearly
visible
on
the
floor
there
was
nothing
else
to
tell
of
the
horrible
crime
that
had
been
committed
here
nothing
but
the
great
hideous
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
room
have
you
made
a
thorough
search
for
the
body
asked
the
doctor
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
no
i
have
done
nothing
to
speak
of
yet
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
there
is
a
gendarme
at
the
gate
no
one
can
go
in
or
out
without
being
very
well
then
let
us
begin
our
search
the
magistrate
and
his
companion
turned
towards
the
door
of
the
room
but
the
doctor
motioned
them
to
come
back
i
see
you
do
not
know
the
house
as
well
as
i
do
he
said
and
led
the
way
towards
a
niche
in
the
side
of
the
wall
which
was
partially
filled
by
a
high
bookcase
ah
that
is
the
entrance
of
the
passage
to
the
church
asked
the
magistrate
in
surprise
yes
this
is
it
the
door
is
not
you
mean
you
believe
that
the
murderers
came
in
from
the
church
why
not
it
is
quite
to
think
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
the
notary
with
a
shake
of
his
head
the
doctor
laughed
bitterly
to
those
who
are
planning
a
murder
a
church
is
no
more
than
any
other
place
there
is
a
bolt
here
as
you
see
i
will
close
this
bolt
now
then
we
can
leave
the
room
knowing
that
no
one
can
enter
it
without
being
the
simple
furniture
of
the
study
a
desk
a
sofa
a
couple
of
chairs
and
several
bookcases
gave
no
chance
of
any
hiding
place
either
for
the
body
of
the
victim
or
for
the
murderers
when
the
men
left
the
room
the
magistrate
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
his
own
pocket
the
gendarme
in
the
neighbouring
apartment
was
sent
down
to
stand
in
the
courtyard
at
the
entrance
to
the
house
the
sexton
a
little
hunchback
was
ordered
to
remain
in
the
vestry
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
from
the
church
to
the
house
then
the
thorough
search
of
the
house
began
every
room
in
both
stories
every
corner
of
the
attic
and
the
cellar
was
looked
over
thoroughly
the
stable
the
barns
the
garden
and
even
the
well
underwent
a
close
examination
there
was
no
trace
of
a
body
anywhere
not
even
a
trail
of
blood
nothing
which
would
give
the
slightest
clue
as
to
how
the
murderers
had
entered
how
they
had
fled
or
what
they
had
done
with
their
victim
the
great
gate
of
the
courtyard
was
closed
the
men
reinforced
by
the
farm
hands
entered
the
church
while
liska
and
the
huddled
in
the
servants
in
a
trembling
group
around
the
old
housekeeper
the
search
in
the
church
as
well
as
in
the
vestry
was
equally
in
vain
there
was
no
trace
to
be
found
there
any
more
than
in
the
house
meanwhile
during
these
hours
of
anxious
seeking
the
rumour
of
another
terrible
crime
had
spread
through
the
village
and
a
crowd
that
grew
from
minute
to
minute
gathered
in
front
of
the
closed
gates
to
the
rectory
in
front
of
the
church
the
closed
doors
of
which
did
not
open
although
it
was
a
high
feast
day
the
utter
silence
from
the
steeple
where
the
bells
hung
mute
added
to
the
spreading
terror
finally
the
doctor
came
out
from
the
rectory
accompanied
by
the
magistrate
and
announced
to
the
waiting
villagers
that
their
venerable
pastor
had
disappeared
under
circumstances
which
left
no
doubt
that
he
had
met
his
death
at
the
hand
of
a
murderer
the
peasants
listened
in
shuddering
silence
the
men
the
women
sobbing
aloud
with
frightened
children
hanging
to
their
skirts
then
at
the
magistrate
s
order
the
crowd
dispersed
slowly
going
to
their
homes
while
a
messenger
set
off
to
the
county
seat
it
was
a
weird
sad
easter
monday
even
nature
seemed
to
feel
the
pressure
of
the
brooding
horror
for
heavy
clouds
piled
up
towards
noon
and
a
chill
wind
blew
fitfully
from
the
north
bending
the
young
corn
and
the
creaking
and
moaning
about
the
roofs
then
an
icy
cold
rain
descended
on
the
village
sending
the
children
the
only
humans
still
unconscious
of
the
fear
that
had
come
on
them
all
into
the
houses
to
play
quietly
in
the
corner
by
the
hearth
there
was
nothing
else
spoken
of
wherever
two
or
three
met
together
throughout
the
village
except
this
dreadful
unexplainable
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
rectory
the
little
village
inn
was
full
to
overflowing
and
the
hum
of
voices
within
was
like
the
noise
of
an
excited
beehive
everyone
had
some
new
explanation
some
new
guess
and
it
was
not
until
the
notary
arrived
looking
even
more
important
than
usual
that
silence
fell
upon
the
excited
throng
but
the
expectations
aroused
by
his
coming
were
not
fulfilled
the
notary
knew
no
more
than
the
others
although
he
had
been
one
of
the
searchers
in
the
rectory
but
he
was
in
no
haste
to
disclose
his
ignorance
and
sat
wrapped
in
a
dignified
silence
until
some
one
found
courage
to
question
him
was
there
nothing
stolen
he
was
asked
no
nothing
as
far
as
we
can
tell
yet
but
if
it
was
the
gypsies
as
may
be
likely
they
are
content
with
so
little
that
it
would
not
be
gypsies
exclaimed
one
man
scornfully
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
gypsies
we
ve
got
enough
tramps
and
vagabonds
of
our
own
didn
t
they
kill
the
pedlar
for
the
sake
of
a
bag
of
tobacco
and
old
katiza
for
a
couple
of
hens
why
do
you
rake
up
things
that
happened
twenty
years
ago
cried
another
over
the
table
you
d
better
tell
us
rather
who
killed
red
betty
and
pulled
janos
the
smith
s
farm
hand
down
into
the
swamp
yes
or
who
cut
the
bridge
supports
when
the
brook
was
in
flood
so
that
two
good
cows
broke
through
and
drowned
yes
indeed
if
we
only
knew
what
band
of
robbers
and
villains
it
is
that
is
ravaging
our
and
they
haven
t
stopped
yet
this
is
the
worst
misfortune
of
all
what
will
our
poor
do
now
that
they
have
murdered
our
good
pastor
who
cared
for
us
all
like
a
father
he
gave
all
he
had
to
the
poor
he
kept
nothing
for
yes
indeed
that
s
how
it
was
and
now
we
can
t
even
give
this
good
man
christian
shepherd
janci
knew
this
morning
early
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
new
pastor
whispered
the
landlord
in
the
notary
s
ear
the
latter
looked
up
astonished
who
said
so
he
asked
my
boy
ferenz
who
went
to
fetch
him
about
seven
o
clock
one
of
my
cows
was
ferenz
was
sent
for
and
told
his
story
the
men
listened
with
great
interest
and
the
smith
a
elderly
man
was
particularly
eager
to
hear
as
he
had
always
believed
in
the
shepherd
s
power
of
second
sight
the
tailor
who
was
more
laughed
and
made
his
jokes
at
this
but
the
smith
laid
one
mighty
hand
on
the
other
s
shoulder
almost
crushing
the
tailor
s
slight
form
under
its
weight
and
said
gravely
friend
do
you
be
silent
in
this
matter
you
ve
come
from
other
parts
and
you
do
not
know
of
things
that
have
happened
here
in
days
gone
by
janci
can
do
more
than
take
care
of
his
sheep
one
day
when
my
little
girl
was
playing
in
the
street
he
said
to
me
have
a
care
of
maruschka
smith
and
three
days
later
the
child
was
dead
the
evening
before
red
betty
was
murdered
he
saw
her
in
a
vision
lying
in
a
coffin
in
front
of
her
door
he
told
it
to
the
sexton
whom
he
met
in
the
fields
and
next
morning
they
found
betty
dead
and
there
are
many
more
things
that
i
could
tell
you
but
what
s
the
use
when
a
man
won
t
believe
it
s
only
lost
talk
to
try
to
make
him
but
one
thing
you
should
know
when
janci
stares
ahead
of
him
without
seeing
what
s
in
front
of
him
then
the
whole
village
begins
to
wonder
what
s
going
to
happen
for
janci
knows
far
more
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
the
smith
s
grave
deep
voice
filled
the
room
and
the
others
listened
in
a
silence
that
gave
assent
to
his
words
he
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
however
when
there
was
a
noise
of
galloping
hoofs
and
rapidly
rolling
wagon
wheels
a
tall
brake
drawn
by
four
handsome
horses
dashed
past
in
a
whirlwind
it
s
the
count
the
count
and
the
district
judge
said
the
landlord
in
a
tone
of
respect
the
notary
made
a
grab
at
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
hurried
from
the
room
that
shows
how
much
they
thought
of
our
pastor
continued
the
landlord
proudly
for
the
count
himself
has
come
and
with
four
horses
too
to
get
here
the
more
quickly
his
reverence
was
a
great
friend
of
the
they
didn
t
make
so
much
fuss
over
the
pedlar
and
betty
murmured
the
cobbler
who
suffered
from
a
perpetual
grouch
but
he
followed
the
others
who
paid
their
scores
hastily
and
went
out
into
the
streets
that
they
might
watch
from
a
distance
at
least
what
was
going
on
in
the
rectory
the
landlord
bustled
about
the
inn
to
have
everything
in
readiness
in
case
the
gentlemen
should
honour
him
by
taking
a
meal
and
perhaps
even
lodgings
at
his
house
at
the
gate
of
the
rectory
the
coachman
and
the
maid
liska
stood
to
receive
the
newcomers
just
as
five
o
clock
was
striking
from
the
steeple
it
should
have
been
still
quite
light
but
it
was
already
dusk
for
the
clouds
hung
heavy
the
rain
had
ceased
but
a
heavy
wind
came
up
which
tore
the
delicate
petals
of
the
blossoms
from
the
fruit
trees
and
strewed
them
like
snow
on
the
ground
beneath
the
count
who
was
the
head
of
one
of
the
richest
and
most
aristocratic
families
in
hungary
threw
off
his
heavy
fur
coat
and
hastened
up
the
stairs
at
the
top
of
which
his
old
friend
and
confidant
the
venerable
pastor
usually
came
to
meet
him
it
was
only
the
local
magistrate
who
stood
there
bowing
deeply
this
is
incredible
incredible
exclaimed
the
count
it
is
indeed
sir
said
the
man
leading
the
magnate
through
the
into
the
pastor
s
study
where
as
far
as
could
be
seen
the
murder
had
been
committed
they
were
joined
by
the
district
judge
who
had
remained
behind
to
give
an
order
sending
a
carriage
to
the
nearest
railway
station
the
judge
too
was
serious
and
deeply
shocked
for
he
also
had
greatly
admired
and
revered
the
old
pastor
the
stately
rectory
had
been
the
scene
of
many
a
jovial
gathering
when
the
lord
of
the
manor
had
made
it
a
centre
for
a
day
s
hunting
with
his
friends
the
bearers
of
some
of
the
proudest
names
in
all
hungary
had
gathered
in
the
rooms
to
laugh
with
the
venerable
pastor
and
to
sample
the
excellent
wines
in
his
cellar
these
wines
which
the
gentlemen
themselves
would
send
in
as
presents
to
the
master
of
the
rectory
would
be
carefully
preserved
for
their
own
enjoyment
not
a
landed
proprietor
for
many
leagues
around
but
knew
and
loved
the
old
pastor
who
had
now
so
strangely
disappeared
under
such
terrifying
circumstances
well
we
might
as
well
begin
our
examination
remarked
the
count
although
if
orszay
s
sharp
eyes
did
not
find
anything
i
doubt
very
much
if
we
will
you
have
asked
the
doctor
to
come
here
again
haven
t
you
yes
your
grace
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
coming
i
sent
the
sexton
to
the
then
the
men
went
in
again
into
the
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
crime
the
wind
rattled
the
open
window
and
blew
out
its
white
curtains
it
was
already
dark
in
the
corners
of
the
room
one
could
see
but
indistinctly
the
carvings
of
the
wainscoting
the
light
backs
of
the
books
or
the
gold
letters
on
the
darker
bindings
made
spots
of
brightness
in
the
gloom
the
hideous
pool
of
blood
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
was
still
plainly
to
be
seen
judging
by
the
loss
of
blood
death
must
have
come
there
was
no
struggle
evidently
for
everything
in
the
room
was
in
perfect
order
when
we
entered
there
is
not
even
a
chair
misplaced
his
bible
is
there
on
the
desk
he
may
have
been
preparing
for
s
yes
that
is
the
case
because
see
here
are
some
notes
in
his
the
count
and
judge
von
kormendy
spoke
these
sentences
at
intervals
as
they
made
their
examination
of
the
room
the
local
magistrate
was
able
to
answer
one
or
two
simpler
questions
but
for
the
most
part
he
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
in
helplessness
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
that
was
at
all
unusual
during
the
night
in
the
rectory
when
the
old
housekeeper
was
called
up
she
could
say
nothing
more
than
this
indeed
it
was
almost
impossible
for
the
old
woman
to
say
anything
her
voice
choked
with
sobs
at
every
second
word
none
of
the
household
force
had
noticed
anything
unusual
or
could
remember
anything
at
all
that
would
throw
light
on
this
mystery
well
then
sir
we
might
just
as
well
sit
down
and
wait
for
the
detective
s
arrival
said
the
judge
you
are
waiting
for
some
one
besides
the
doctor
asked
the
local
magistrate
timidly
yes
his
grace
telegraphed
to
budapest
answered
the
district
judge
looking
at
his
watch
and
if
the
train
is
on
time
the
man
we
are
waiting
for
ought
to
be
here
in
an
hour
you
sent
the
carriage
to
the
station
didn
t
you
is
the
driver
reliable
yes
sir
he
is
a
dependable
man
said
the
old
housekeeper
orszay
entered
the
room
just
then
and
the
count
introduced
him
to
the
district
judge
who
was
still
a
stranger
to
him
i
fear
count
that
our
eyes
will
serve
but
little
in
discovering
the
truth
of
this
mystery
said
the
doctor
the
nobleman
nodded
i
agree
with
you
he
replied
and
i
have
sent
for
sharper
eyes
than
either
yours
or
the
doctor
looked
his
question
and
the
count
continued
when
the
news
came
to
me
i
telegraphed
to
pest
for
a
police
detective
telling
them
that
the
case
was
peculiar
and
urgent
i
received
an
answer
as
i
stopped
at
the
station
on
my
way
here
this
is
it
detective
joseph
muller
from
vienna
in
budapest
by
chance
have
sent
him
to
take
your
muller
exclaimed
orszay
can
it
be
the
celebrated
muller
the
most
famous
detective
of
the
austrian
police
that
would
indeed
be
a
i
hope
and
believe
that
it
is
said
the
count
gravely
i
have
heard
of
this
man
and
we
need
such
a
one
here
that
we
may
find
the
source
of
these
many
misfortunes
which
have
overwhelmed
our
peaceful
village
for
two
years
past
it
is
indeed
a
stroke
of
good
luck
that
has
led
a
man
of
such
gifts
into
our
neighbourhood
at
a
time
when
he
is
so
greatly
needed
i
believe
personally
that
it
is
the
same
person
or
persons
who
have
been
the
perpetrators
of
all
these
outrages
and
i
intend
once
for
all
to
put
a
stop
to
it
let
it
cost
what
it
if
any
one
can
discover
the
truth
it
will
be
muller
said
the
district
judge
it
was
i
who
told
the
count
how
fortunate
we
were
that
this
man
who
is
known
to
the
police
throughout
austria
and
far
beyond
the
borders
of
our
kingdom
should
have
chanced
to
be
in
budapest
and
free
to
come
to
us
when
we
called
you
and
i
he
turned
with
a
smile
to
the
local
magistrate
you
and
i
can
get
away
with
the
usual
cases
of
local
brutality
hereabouts
but
the
cunning
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
these
crimes
is
one
too
many
for
the
men
had
taken
their
places
around
the
great
the
old
housekeeper
had
crept
out
again
her
terror
making
her
forget
her
usual
hospitality
and
indeed
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
the
guests
to
ask
or
even
to
wish
for
any
refreshment
the
maid
brought
a
lamp
which
sent
its
weak
rays
scarcely
beyond
the
edges
of
the
big
table
the
four
men
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
i
suppose
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
who
has
been
coming
and
going
from
the
rectory
the
last
few
days
began
the
count
oh
yes
indeed
sir
said
the
district
judge
with
a
sigh
for
if
this
murderer
is
the
same
who
committed
the
other
crimes
he
must
live
here
in
or
near
the
village
and
therefore
must
be
known
to
all
and
not
likely
to
excite
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
put
in
the
doctor
there
must
be
at
least
two
of
them
one
man
alone
could
not
have
carried
off
the
farm
hand
who
was
killed
to
the
swamp
where
his
body
was
found
nor
could
one
man
alone
have
taken
away
the
bloody
body
of
the
pastor
our
venerable
friend
was
a
man
of
size
and
weight
as
you
know
and
one
man
alone
could
not
have
dragged
his
body
from
the
room
without
leaving
an
easily
seen
the
judge
blushed
but
he
nodded
in
affirmation
to
the
doctor
s
words
this
thought
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
in
fact
the
judge
was
more
notable
for
his
good
will
and
his
love
of
justice
rather
than
for
his
keen
intelligence
he
was
as
well
aware
of
this
as
was
any
one
else
and
he
was
heartily
glad
that
the
count
had
sent
to
the
capital
for
reinforcements
some
time
more
passed
in
deep
silence
each
of
the
men
was
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
a
sigh
broke
the
silence
now
and
then
and
a
slight
movement
when
one
or
the
other
drew
out
his
watch
or
raised
his
head
to
look
at
the
door
finally
the
sound
of
a
carriage
outside
was
heard
the
men
sprang
up
the
driver
s
voice
was
heard
then
steps
which
ascended
the
stairs
lowly
and
lightly
audible
only
because
the
stillness
was
so
great
the
door
opened
and
a
small
slight
man
with
a
gentle
face
and
keen
grey
eyes
stood
on
the
threshold
i
am
joseph
muller
he
said
with
a
low
soft
voice
the
four
men
in
the
room
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
this
individual
is
the
man
that
every
one
is
afraid
of
thought
the
count
as
he
walked
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
to
the
stranger
i
sent
for
you
muller
said
the
magnate
conscious
of
his
stately
size
and
appearance
as
well
as
of
his
importance
in
the
presence
of
a
personage
who
so
little
looked
what
his
great
fame
might
have
led
one
to
expect
then
you
are
count
answered
muller
gently
i
was
in
budapest
having
just
finished
a
difficult
case
which
took
me
there
they
told
me
that
a
mysterious
crime
had
happened
in
your
neighbourhood
and
sent
me
here
to
take
charge
of
it
you
will
pardon
any
ignorance
i
may
show
as
a
stranger
to
this
locality
i
will
do
my
best
and
it
may
be
possible
that
i
can
help
the
count
introduced
the
other
gentlemen
in
order
and
they
sat
down
again
at
the
table
and
now
what
is
it
you
want
me
for
count
asked
muller
there
was
a
murder
committed
in
this
house
answered
the
count
when
last
who
is
the
victim
our
how
was
he
killed
we
do
not
you
are
not
a
physician
then
asked
muller
turning
to
orszay
yes
i
am
answered
the
latter
well
the
body
is
missing
said
orszay
somewhat
sharply
missing
muller
became
greatly
interested
will
you
please
lead
me
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
the
others
led
him
into
the
next
room
the
magistrate
going
ahead
with
a
lamp
the
judge
called
for
more
lights
and
the
group
stood
around
the
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
of
the
study
muller
s
arms
were
crossed
on
his
breast
as
he
stood
looking
down
at
the
hideous
spot
there
was
no
terror
in
his
eyes
as
in
those
of
the
others
but
only
a
keen
attention
and
a
lively
interest
who
has
been
in
this
room
since
the
discovery
he
asked
the
doctor
replied
that
only
the
servants
of
the
immediate
household
the
notary
the
magistrate
and
himself
then
later
the
count
and
the
district
judge
entered
the
room
you
are
quite
certain
that
no
one
else
has
been
in
here
no
no
one
will
you
kindly
send
for
the
three
servants
the
magistrate
left
the
room
who
else
lives
in
the
house
the
sexton
and
the
and
no
one
else
has
left
the
house
or
has
entered
it
no
one
the
main
door
has
been
watched
all
day
by
a
is
there
but
one
door
out
of
this
room
no
there
is
a
small
door
beside
that
where
does
it
lead
to
it
leads
to
a
passageway
at
the
end
of
which
there
is
a
stair
down
into
the
muller
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
vestry
as
well
as
the
church
have
neither
of
them
been
opened
on
the
side
toward
the
the
church
or
the
vestry
you
mean
corrected
muller
how
many
doors
have
they
on
the
street
side
one
the
locks
on
these
doors
were
in
good
condition
yes
they
were
was
there
anything
stolen
from
the
church
no
nothing
that
we
could
was
the
pastor
rich
no
he
was
almost
a
poor
man
for
he
gave
away
all
that
he
but
you
were
his
patron
i
was
his
friend
he
was
the
confidential
adviser
of
myself
and
this
would
mean
rich
presents
now
and
then
would
it
not
no
that
is
not
the
case
our
venerable
pastor
would
take
nothing
for
himself
he
would
accept
no
presents
but
gifts
of
money
for
his
then
you
do
not
believe
this
to
have
been
a
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
no
there
was
nothing
disturbed
in
any
part
of
the
house
no
drawers
or
cupboards
broken
open
at
muller
smiled
i
have
heard
it
said
that
your
romantic
hungarian
bandits
will
often
be
satisfied
with
the
small
booty
they
may
find
in
the
pocket
or
on
the
person
of
their
you
are
right
muller
but
that
is
only
when
they
can
find
nothing
or
perhaps
if
it
is
a
case
of
revenge
it
can
not
be
revenge
in
this
case
the
pastor
was
greatly
loved
he
was
loved
and
by
every
one
by
every
one
the
four
men
answered
at
once
muller
was
still
a
while
his
eyes
were
veiled
and
his
face
thoughtful
finally
he
raised
his
head
there
has
been
nothing
moved
or
changed
in
this
room
no
neither
here
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
house
or
the
church
answered
the
local
magistrate
that
is
good
now
i
would
like
to
question
the
muller
had
already
started
for
the
door
then
he
turned
back
into
the
room
and
pointing
toward
the
second
door
he
asked
is
that
door
locked
yes
answered
the
count
i
found
it
locked
when
i
examined
it
myself
a
short
time
it
was
locked
on
the
inside
yes
locked
on
the
very
well
then
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
here
for
the
time
being
let
us
go
back
into
the
the
men
returned
to
the
muller
last
for
he
stopped
to
lock
the
door
of
the
study
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
began
his
examination
of
the
servants
the
old
housekeeper
who
as
usual
was
the
first
to
rise
in
the
household
had
also
as
usual
rung
the
bell
to
waken
the
other
servants
then
when
liska
came
downstairs
she
had
sent
her
up
to
the
pastor
s
room
his
bedroom
was
to
the
right
of
the
liska
had
as
usual
knocked
on
the
door
exactly
at
seven
o
clock
and
continued
knocking
for
some
few
minutes
without
receiving
any
answer
slightly
alarmed
the
girl
had
gone
back
and
told
the
housekeeper
that
the
pastor
did
not
answer
then
the
old
woman
asked
the
coachman
to
go
up
and
see
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
the
reverend
gentleman
the
man
returned
in
a
few
moments
pale
and
trembling
in
every
limb
and
apparently
struck
dumb
by
fright
he
motioned
the
women
to
follow
him
and
all
three
crept
up
the
stairs
the
coachman
led
them
first
to
the
pastor
s
bed
which
was
untouched
and
then
to
the
pool
of
blood
in
his
study
the
sight
of
the
latter
frightened
the
servants
so
much
that
they
did
not
notice
at
first
that
there
was
no
sign
of
the
pastor
himself
whom
they
now
knew
must
have
been
murdered
when
they
finally
came
to
themselves
sufficiently
to
take
some
action
the
man
hurried
off
to
call
the
magistrate
and
liska
ran
to
the
asylum
to
fetch
the
old
doctor
the
pastor
s
intimate
friend
the
aged
housekeeper
trembling
in
fear
crept
back
to
her
own
room
and
sat
there
waiting
the
return
of
the
others
this
was
the
story
of
the
early
morning
as
told
by
the
three
servants
who
had
already
given
their
report
in
much
the
same
words
to
the
count
on
his
arrival
and
also
to
the
magistrate
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
the
words
of
either
the
old
housekeeper
or
of
janos
the
coachman
who
had
served
for
more
than
twenty
years
in
the
rectory
and
whose
fidelity
was
known
the
girl
liska
was
scarcely
eighteen
and
her
round
childish
face
and
big
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
corroborated
her
story
when
they
had
told
muller
all
they
knew
the
detective
sat
stroking
his
chin
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
then
he
raised
his
head
and
said
in
a
tone
of
calm
friendliness
well
good
friends
this
will
do
for
now
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
a
bite
to
eat
and
a
glass
of
some
light
wine
i
d
be
very
thankful
i
have
had
no
food
since
early
this
the
housekeeper
and
the
maid
disappeared
and
janos
went
to
the
stable
to
harness
the
count
s
trap
the
magnate
turned
to
the
detective
i
thank
you
once
more
that
you
have
come
to
us
i
appreciate
it
greatly
that
a
stranger
to
our
part
of
the
country
like
yourself
should
give
his
time
and
strength
to
this
problem
of
our
obscure
little
there
is
nothing
else
calling
me
sir
answered
muller
and
the
budapest
police
will
explain
to
headquarters
at
vienna
if
i
do
not
return
at
do
you
understand
our
tongue
sufficiently
to
deal
with
these
people
here
oh
yes
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
that
i
have
hunted
criminals
in
hungary
before
and
a
case
of
this
kind
does
not
usually
call
for
disguises
in
which
any
accent
would
betray
it
is
a
strange
profession
said
the
doctor
one
gets
used
to
it
like
everything
else
answered
muller
with
a
gentle
smile
and
now
i
have
to
thank
you
gentlemen
for
your
confidence
in
which
i
know
you
will
justify
said
the
count
muller
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
haven
t
felt
anything
yet
but
it
will
come
there
s
something
in
the
the
count
smiled
at
his
manner
of
expressing
himself
but
all
four
of
the
men
had
already
begun
to
feel
sympathy
and
respect
for
this
little
person
whose
words
were
so
few
and
whose
voice
was
so
gentle
something
in
his
grey
eyes
and
in
the
quiet
determination
of
his
manner
made
them
realise
that
he
had
won
his
fame
honestly
with
the
enthusiasm
of
his
race
the
hungarian
count
pressed
the
detective
s
hand
in
a
warm
grasp
as
he
said
i
know
that
we
can
trust
in
you
you
will
avenge
the
death
of
my
old
friend
and
of
those
others
who
were
killed
here
the
doctor
and
the
magistrate
will
tell
you
about
them
we
two
will
go
home
now
telegraph
us
as
soon
as
anything
has
happened
every
one
in
the
village
will
be
ready
to
help
you
and
of
course
you
can
call
on
me
for
funds
here
is
something
to
begin
with
these
words
the
count
laid
a
silk
purse
full
of
gold
pieces
on
the
table
one
more
pressure
of
the
hand
and
he
was
gone
the
other
men
also
left
the
room
following
the
count
s
lead
in
a
cordial
farewell
of
the
detective
they
also
shared
the
nobleman
s
feeling
that
now
indeed
with
this
man
to
help
them
could
the
cloud
of
horror
that
had
hung
over
the
village
for
two
years
and
had
culminated
in
the
present
catastrophe
be
lifted
the
excitement
of
the
count
s
departure
had
died
away
and
the
steps
of
the
other
men
on
their
way
to
the
village
had
faded
in
the
distance
there
was
nothing
now
to
be
heard
but
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
creaking
of
the
boughs
as
the
trees
bent
before
the
onrush
of
the
wind
muller
stood
alone
with
folded
arms
in
the
middle
of
the
large
room
letting
his
sharp
eyes
wander
about
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
lamps
he
was
glad
to
be
alone
for
only
when
he
was
alone
could
his
brain
do
its
best
work
he
took
up
one
of
the
lamps
and
opened
the
door
to
the
room
in
which
as
far
as
could
be
known
the
murder
had
been
committed
he
walked
in
carefully
and
setting
the
lamp
on
the
desk
examined
the
articles
lying
about
on
it
there
was
nothing
of
importance
to
be
found
there
an
open
bible
and
a
sheet
of
paper
with
notes
for
the
day
s
sermon
lay
on
top
of
the
desk
in
the
drawers
none
of
which
were
locked
were
official
papers
books
manuscripts
of
former
sermons
and
a
few
unimportant
personal
notes
the
flame
of
the
lamp
flickered
in
the
breeze
that
came
from
the
open
window
but
muller
did
not
close
the
casement
he
wanted
to
leave
everything
just
as
he
had
found
it
until
daylight
when
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
leave
the
lamp
there
he
took
it
up
again
and
left
the
room
what
is
the
use
of
being
impatient
he
said
to
himself
if
i
move
about
in
this
poor
light
i
will
be
sure
to
ruin
some
possible
clue
for
there
must
be
some
clue
left
here
it
is
impossible
for
even
the
most
practiced
criminal
not
to
leave
some
trace
of
his
the
detective
returned
to
the
locking
the
study
door
carefully
behind
him
the
maid
and
the
coachman
returned
bringing
in
an
abundant
supper
and
muller
sat
down
to
do
justice
to
the
many
good
things
on
the
tray
when
the
maid
returned
to
take
away
the
dishes
she
inquired
whether
she
should
put
the
guest
chamber
in
order
for
the
detective
he
told
her
not
to
go
to
any
trouble
for
his
sake
that
he
would
sleep
in
the
bed
in
the
neighbouring
room
you
going
to
sleep
in
there
said
the
girl
horrified
yes
my
child
and
i
think
i
will
sleep
well
i
feel
very
liska
carried
the
things
out
shaking
her
head
in
surprise
at
this
thin
little
man
who
did
not
seem
to
know
what
it
was
to
be
afraid
half
an
hour
later
the
rectory
was
in
darkness
before
he
retired
muller
had
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
pastor
s
bedroom
nothing
was
disturbed
anywhere
and
it
was
evident
that
the
priest
had
not
made
any
preparations
for
the
night
but
was
still
at
work
at
his
desk
in
the
study
when
death
overtook
him
when
he
came
to
this
conclusion
the
detective
went
to
bed
and
soon
fell
asleep
in
his
little
hut
near
the
asylum
gates
shepherd
janci
slept
as
sound
as
usual
but
he
was
dreaming
and
he
spoke
in
his
sleep
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
for
his
faithful
margit
was
snoring
loudly
snatches
of
sentences
and
broken
words
came
from
janci
s
lips
the
hand
the
big
hand
i
see
it
at
his
throat
the
face
the
yellow
face
it
laughs
next
morning
the
children
on
their
way
to
school
crept
past
the
rectory
with
wide
eyes
and
open
mouths
and
the
grown
people
spoke
in
lower
tones
when
their
work
led
them
past
the
handsome
old
house
it
had
once
been
their
pride
but
now
it
was
a
place
of
horror
to
them
the
old
housekeeper
had
succumbed
to
her
fright
and
was
very
liska
went
about
her
work
silently
and
the
farm
servants
walked
more
heavily
and
chattered
less
than
they
had
before
the
sexton
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
enter
the
church
and
therefore
had
nothing
to
do
made
an
early
start
for
the
inn
where
he
spent
most
of
the
day
telling
what
little
he
knew
to
the
many
who
made
an
excuse
to
follow
him
there
the
only
calm
and
undisturbed
person
in
the
rectory
household
was
muller
he
had
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
entire
scene
of
the
murder
but
had
not
found
anything
at
all
of
one
thing
alone
was
he
certain
the
murderer
had
come
through
the
hidden
passageway
from
the
church
there
were
two
reasons
to
believe
this
one
of
which
might
possibly
not
be
sufficient
but
the
other
was
conclusive
the
heavy
armchair
before
the
desk
the
chair
on
which
the
pastor
was
presumably
sitting
when
the
murderer
entered
was
half
turned
around
turned
in
just
such
a
way
as
it
would
have
been
had
the
man
who
was
sitting
there
suddenly
sprung
up
in
excitement
or
surprise
the
chair
was
pushed
back
a
step
from
the
desk
and
turned
towards
the
entrance
to
the
passageway
those
who
had
been
in
the
room
during
the
day
had
reported
that
they
had
not
touched
any
one
of
the
articles
of
furniture
therefore
the
position
of
the
chair
was
the
same
that
had
been
given
it
by
the
man
who
had
sat
in
it
by
the
murdered
pastor
himself
of
course
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
some
one
had
moved
the
chair
without
realising
it
this
clue
therefore
could
not
be
looked
upon
as
an
absolutely
certain
one
had
it
stood
alone
but
there
was
other
evidence
far
more
important
the
great
pool
of
blood
was
just
between
the
door
of
the
passage
and
the
armchair
it
was
here
therefore
that
the
attack
had
taken
place
the
pastor
could
not
have
turned
in
this
direction
in
the
hope
of
flight
for
there
was
nothing
here
to
give
him
shelter
no
weapon
that
he
could
grasp
not
even
a
cane
he
must
have
turned
in
this
direction
to
meet
and
greet
the
invader
who
had
entered
his
room
in
this
unusual
manner
turned
to
meet
him
as
a
brave
man
would
with
no
other
weapon
than
the
sacredness
of
his
calling
and
his
age
but
this
had
not
been
enough
to
protect
the
venerable
priest
the
murderer
must
have
made
his
thrust
at
once
and
his
victim
had
sunk
down
dying
on
the
floor
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
spent
so
many
hours
of
quiet
study
in
which
he
had
brought
comfort
and
given
advice
to
so
many
anxious
hearts
for
dying
he
must
have
been
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
man
to
lose
so
much
blood
and
live
the
struggle
thought
the
detective
but
was
there
a
struggle
he
looked
about
the
room
again
but
could
see
nothing
that
showed
disorder
anywhere
in
its
immaculate
neatness
no
there
could
have
been
no
struggle
it
must
have
been
a
quick
knife
thrust
and
death
at
once
not
a
shot
no
a
shot
would
have
been
heard
by
the
night
watchman
walking
the
streets
near
the
church
the
night
was
quiet
the
window
open
some
one
in
the
village
would
have
heard
the
noise
of
a
shot
and
it
was
not
likely
that
the
old
housekeeper
who
slept
in
the
room
immediately
below
slept
the
light
sleep
of
the
aged
would
have
failed
to
have
heard
the
firing
of
a
pistol
muller
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
directly
in
front
of
the
pool
of
blood
looking
at
it
carefully
suddenly
he
bowed
his
head
deeper
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
fine
thread
of
the
red
fluid
which
had
been
drawn
out
for
about
a
foot
or
two
in
the
direction
towards
the
door
to
the
what
did
that
mean
did
it
mean
that
the
murderer
went
out
through
that
door
dragging
something
after
him
that
made
this
delicate
line
muller
bent
down
still
deeper
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
floor
sending
its
clear
rays
obliquely
through
the
window
the
sharp
eyes
which
now
covered
every
inch
of
the
floor
discovered
something
else
they
discovered
that
this
red
thread
curved
slightly
and
had
a
continuation
in
a
fine
scratch
in
the
paint
of
the
floor
muller
followed
up
this
scratch
and
it
led
him
over
towards
the
window
and
then
back
again
in
wide
curves
then
out
again
under
the
desk
and
finally
growing
weaker
and
weaker
it
came
back
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pool
of
blood
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
it
muller
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
follow
up
the
scratch
he
did
not
notice
the
discomfort
of
his
position
his
eyes
shone
in
excitement
and
a
deep
flush
glowed
in
his
cheeks
also
he
began
to
whistle
softly
joseph
muller
the
bloodhound
of
the
austrian
police
had
found
a
clue
a
clue
that
soon
would
bring
him
to
the
trail
he
was
seeking
he
did
not
know
yet
what
he
could
do
with
his
clue
but
this
much
he
knew
sooner
or
later
this
scratch
in
the
floor
would
lead
him
to
the
murderer
the
trail
might
be
long
and
devious
but
he
would
follow
it
and
at
its
end
would
be
success
he
knew
that
this
scratch
had
been
made
after
the
murder
was
committed
this
was
proved
by
the
blood
that
marked
its
beginning
and
it
could
not
have
been
made
by
any
of
those
who
entered
the
room
during
the
day
because
by
that
time
the
blood
had
dried
this
strange
streak
in
the
floor
with
its
weird
curves
and
spirals
could
have
been
made
only
by
the
murderer
but
how
with
what
instrument
there
was
the
riddle
which
must
be
solved
and
now
muller
making
another
careful
examination
of
the
floor
found
something
else
it
was
something
that
might
be
utterly
unimportant
or
might
be
of
great
value
it
was
a
tiny
bit
of
hardened
lacquer
which
he
found
on
the
floor
beside
one
of
the
legs
of
the
desk
it
was
rounded
out
with
sharp
edges
and
coloured
grey
with
a
tiny
zigzag
of
yellow
on
its
surface
muller
lifted
it
carefully
and
looked
at
it
keenly
this
tiny
bit
of
lacquer
had
evidently
been
knocked
off
from
some
convex
object
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
at
the
moment
just
what
sort
of
an
object
it
might
have
been
there
are
so
many
different
things
which
are
customarily
covered
with
lacquer
however
further
examination
brought
him
down
to
a
narrower
range
of
subjects
for
on
the
inside
of
the
lacquer
he
found
a
shred
of
reddish
wood
fibre
it
must
have
been
a
wooden
object
therefore
from
which
the
lacquer
came
and
the
wood
had
been
of
reddish
tinge
muller
pondered
the
matter
for
a
little
while
longer
then
he
placed
his
discovery
carefully
in
the
pastor
s
emptied
and
dropped
the
box
in
his
own
pocket
he
closed
the
window
and
the
door
to
the
lit
a
lamp
and
entered
the
passageway
leading
to
the
vestry
it
was
a
short
passageway
scarcely
more
than
a
dozen
paces
long
the
walls
were
whitewashed
the
floor
tiled
and
the
entire
passage
shone
in
neatness
muller
held
the
light
of
his
lamp
to
every
inch
of
it
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
criminal
had
gone
through
here
with
the
body
of
his
victim
the
criminal
muller
still
thought
of
only
one
his
long
experience
had
taught
him
that
the
most
intricate
crimes
were
usually
committed
by
one
man
only
the
strength
necessary
for
such
a
crime
as
this
did
not
deceive
him
either
he
knew
that
in
extraordinary
moments
extraordinary
strength
will
come
to
the
one
who
needs
it
he
now
passed
down
the
steps
leading
into
the
vestry
there
was
no
trace
of
any
kind
here
either
the
door
into
the
vestry
was
not
locked
it
was
seldom
locked
they
had
told
him
for
the
vestry
itself
was
closed
by
a
huge
carved
portal
with
a
heavy
ornamented
iron
lock
that
could
be
opened
only
with
the
greatest
noise
and
trouble
this
door
was
locked
and
closed
as
it
had
been
since
yesterday
morning
everything
in
the
vestry
was
in
perfect
order
the
priest
s
garments
and
the
censers
all
in
their
places
muller
assured
himself
of
this
before
he
left
the
little
room
he
then
opened
the
glass
door
that
led
down
by
a
few
steps
into
the
church
it
was
a
beautiful
old
church
and
it
was
a
rich
church
also
it
was
built
in
the
older
gothic
style
and
its
heavy
walls
its
massive
columns
would
have
made
it
look
cold
and
bare
had
not
handsome
tapestries
the
gift
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
covered
the
walls
fine
old
pictures
hung
here
and
there
above
the
altars
and
handsome
stained
glass
windows
broke
the
light
that
fell
into
the
high
vaulted
interior
there
were
three
great
altars
in
the
church
all
of
them
richly
decorated
the
main
altar
stood
isolated
in
the
choir
in
the
open
space
behind
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
now
veiled
in
a
mysterious
twilight
heavy
silver
candlesticks
three
on
a
side
stood
on
the
altar
the
pale
gold
of
the
tabernacle
door
gleamed
between
them
muller
walked
through
the
silent
church
in
which
even
his
light
steps
resounded
uncannily
he
looked
into
each
of
the
pews
into
the
confessionals
he
walked
around
all
the
columns
he
climbed
up
into
the
pulpit
he
did
everything
that
the
others
had
done
before
him
yesterday
and
as
with
them
he
found
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
the
murderer
had
spent
any
time
in
the
church
finally
he
turned
back
once
more
to
the
main
altar
on
his
way
out
but
he
did
not
leave
the
church
as
he
intended
his
last
look
at
the
altar
had
showed
him
something
that
attracted
his
attention
and
he
walked
up
the
three
steps
to
examine
it
more
closely
what
he
had
seen
was
something
unusual
about
one
of
the
silver
candlesticks
these
candlesticks
had
three
feet
and
five
of
them
were
placed
in
such
a
way
that
the
two
front
feet
were
turned
toward
the
spectator
but
on
the
end
candlestick
nearest
muller
the
single
foot
projected
out
to
the
front
of
the
altar
this
candlestick
therefore
had
been
set
down
hastily
not
placed
carefully
in
the
order
of
things
as
were
the
others
and
not
only
this
the
heavy
wax
candle
which
was
in
the
candlestick
was
burned
down
about
a
finger
s
breadth
more
than
the
others
for
these
were
all
exactly
of
a
height
muller
bent
still
nearer
to
the
candlestick
but
he
saw
that
the
dim
light
in
the
church
was
not
sufficient
he
went
to
one
of
the
smaller
side
altars
took
a
candle
from
there
lit
it
with
one
of
the
matches
that
he
found
in
his
own
pocket
and
returned
with
the
burning
candle
to
the
main
altar
the
steps
leading
up
to
this
altar
were
covered
by
a
large
rug
with
a
white
ground
and
a
pattern
of
flowers
looking
carefully
at
it
the
detective
saw
a
tiny
brown
spot
the
mark
of
a
burn
upon
one
of
the
white
surfaces
beside
it
lay
a
half
used
match
walking
around
this
carefully
muller
approached
the
candlestick
that
interested
him
and
holding
up
his
light
he
examined
every
inch
of
its
surface
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
there
were
dark
red
spots
between
the
rough
edges
of
the
silver
ornamentation
then
the
body
is
somewhere
around
here
thought
the
detective
and
came
down
from
the
steps
still
holding
the
burning
candle
he
walked
slowly
to
the
back
of
the
altar
there
was
a
little
table
there
such
as
held
the
sacred
dishes
for
the
communion
service
and
the
little
steps
which
the
sexton
put
out
for
the
pastor
when
he
took
the
monstrance
from
the
tabernacle
that
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
in
the
dark
corner
behind
the
altar
holding
his
candle
close
to
the
floor
muller
discovered
an
iron
ring
fastened
to
one
of
the
big
stone
flags
this
must
be
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
muller
tried
to
raise
the
flag
and
was
astonished
to
find
how
easily
it
came
up
it
was
a
square
of
reddish
marble
the
same
with
which
the
entire
floor
of
the
church
was
tiled
this
flag
was
very
thin
and
could
easily
be
raised
and
placed
back
against
the
wall
muller
took
up
his
candle
too
greatly
excited
to
stop
to
get
a
stick
for
it
he
felt
assured
that
now
he
would
soon
be
able
to
solve
at
least
a
part
of
the
mystery
he
climbed
down
the
steps
carefully
and
found
that
they
led
into
the
crypt
as
he
supposed
they
were
kept
spotlessly
clean
as
was
the
entire
crypt
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
by
the
light
of
his
flickering
candle
he
was
not
surprised
to
discover
that
the
air
was
perfectly
pure
here
there
must
be
windows
or
ventilators
somewhere
this
he
knew
from
the
way
his
candle
behaved
the
ancient
vault
had
a
high
arched
ceiling
and
heavy
massive
pillars
it
was
a
subterranean
repetition
of
the
church
above
there
had
evidently
been
a
convent
attached
to
this
church
at
one
time
for
here
stood
a
row
of
simple
wooden
coffins
all
exactly
alike
bearing
each
one
upon
its
lid
a
roughly
painted
cross
surrounded
by
a
wreath
thus
were
buried
the
monks
of
days
long
past
muller
walked
slowly
through
the
rows
of
coffins
looking
eagerly
to
each
side
suddenly
he
stopped
and
stood
still
his
hand
did
not
tremble
but
his
thin
face
was
pale
pale
as
that
face
which
looked
up
at
him
out
of
one
of
the
coffins
the
lid
of
the
coffin
stood
up
against
the
wall
and
muller
saw
that
there
were
several
other
empty
ones
further
on
waiting
for
their
silent
occupants
the
body
in
the
open
coffin
before
which
muller
stood
was
the
body
of
the
man
who
had
been
missing
since
the
day
previous
he
lay
there
quite
peacefully
his
hands
crossed
over
his
breast
his
eyes
closed
a
line
of
pain
about
his
lips
in
the
crossed
fingers
was
a
little
bunch
of
dark
yellow
roses
at
the
first
glance
one
might
almost
have
thought
that
loving
hands
had
laid
the
old
pastor
in
his
coffin
but
the
red
stain
on
the
white
cloth
about
his
throat
and
the
bloody
disorder
of
his
hair
contrasted
sadly
with
the
look
of
peace
on
the
dead
face
under
his
head
was
a
white
silk
cushion
one
of
the
cushions
from
the
altar
muller
stood
looking
down
for
some
time
at
this
poor
victim
of
a
strange
crime
then
he
turned
to
go
he
wanted
to
know
one
thing
more
how
the
murderer
had
left
the
crypt
the
flame
of
his
candle
told
him
for
it
nearly
went
out
in
a
gust
of
wind
that
came
down
the
opening
right
above
him
this
was
a
window
about
three
or
four
feet
from
the
floor
protected
by
rusty
iron
bars
which
had
been
sawed
through
leaving
the
opening
free
it
was
a
small
window
but
it
was
large
enough
to
allow
a
man
of
much
greater
size
than
muller
to
pass
through
it
the
detective
blew
out
his
candle
and
climbed
up
onto
the
window
sill
he
found
himself
outside
in
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
a
thicket
of
heavy
bushes
grown
up
over
neglected
graves
completely
hid
the
opening
through
which
he
had
come
there
were
thorns
on
these
bushes
and
also
a
few
scattered
roses
dark
yellow
roses
muller
walked
thoughtfully
through
the
churchyard
the
sexton
sat
huddled
in
an
unhappy
heap
at
the
gate
he
looked
up
in
alarm
as
he
saw
the
detective
walking
towards
him
something
in
the
stranger
s
face
told
the
little
hunchback
that
he
had
made
a
discovery
the
sexton
sprang
up
his
lips
did
not
dare
utter
the
question
that
his
eyes
asked
i
have
found
him
said
the
detective
gravely
the
hunchback
sexton
staggered
then
recovered
himself
and
hurried
away
to
fetch
the
magistrate
and
the
doctor
an
hour
later
the
murdered
pastor
lay
in
state
in
the
chief
apartment
of
his
home
surrounded
by
burning
candles
and
masses
of
flowers
but
he
still
lay
in
the
simple
convent
coffin
and
the
little
bunch
of
roses
which
his
murderer
had
placed
between
his
stiffening
fingers
had
not
been
touched
two
days
later
the
pastor
was
buried
the
count
and
his
family
led
the
train
of
numerous
mourners
and
among
the
last
was
muller
a
day
or
two
after
the
funeral
the
detective
sauntered
slowly
through
the
main
street
of
the
village
he
was
not
in
a
very
good
humour
his
answer
to
the
greeting
of
those
who
passed
him
was
short
the
children
avoided
him
for
with
the
keenness
of
their
kind
they
recognised
the
fact
that
this
usually
gentle
little
man
was
not
in
possession
of
his
habitual
calm
temper
one
group
of
boys
playing
with
a
top
did
not
notice
his
coming
and
muller
stopped
behind
them
to
look
on
suddenly
a
sharp
whistle
was
heard
and
the
boys
looked
up
from
their
play
surprised
at
seeing
the
stranger
behind
them
his
eyes
were
gleaming
and
his
cheeks
were
flushed
and
a
few
bars
of
a
merry
tune
came
in
a
keen
whistle
from
his
lips
as
he
watched
the
spirals
made
by
the
spinning
top
before
the
boys
could
stop
their
play
the
detective
had
left
the
group
and
hastened
onward
to
the
little
shop
he
left
it
again
in
eager
haste
after
having
made
his
purchase
and
hurried
back
to
the
rectory
the
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
in
surprise
at
this
grown
man
who
came
to
buy
a
top
and
at
home
in
the
rectory
the
old
housekeeper
listened
in
equal
surprise
to
the
humming
noise
over
her
head
she
thought
at
first
it
might
be
a
bee
that
had
got
in
somehow
then
she
realised
that
it
was
not
quite
the
same
noise
and
having
already
concluded
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
be
surprised
at
anything
this
strange
guest
might
do
she
continued
reading
her
scriptures
upstairs
in
the
pastor
s
study
muller
sat
in
the
armchair
attentively
watching
the
gyrations
of
a
spinning
top
the
little
toy
started
at
a
certain
point
drew
a
line
exactly
parallel
to
the
scratch
on
the
floor
that
had
excited
his
thoughts
and
absorbed
them
day
and
night
it
was
a
top
a
top
repeated
the
detective
to
himself
again
and
again
i
don
t
see
why
i
didn
t
think
of
that
right
away
why
of
course
nothing
else
could
have
drawn
such
a
perfect
curve
around
the
room
unhindered
by
the
legs
of
the
desk
only
i
don
t
see
how
a
toy
like
that
could
have
any
connection
with
this
cruel
and
purposeless
murder
why
only
a
fool
or
a
madman
muller
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
again
a
sharp
shrill
whistle
came
from
his
lips
a
madman
he
repeated
beating
his
own
forehead
it
could
only
have
been
a
madman
who
committed
this
murder
and
the
pastor
was
not
the
first
there
were
two
other
murders
here
within
a
comparatively
short
time
i
think
i
will
take
advantage
of
orszay
s
half
an
hour
later
muller
and
the
doctor
sat
together
in
a
from
the
windows
of
which
one
could
see
the
park
surrounding
the
asylum
to
almost
its
entire
extent
the
park
was
arranged
with
due
regard
to
its
purpose
the
eye
could
sweep
through
it
unhindered
there
were
no
bushes
except
immediately
along
the
high
wall
otherwise
there
were
beautiful
lawns
flower
beds
and
groups
of
fine
old
trees
with
tall
trunks
as
would
be
natural
in
visiting
such
a
place
muller
had
induced
the
doctor
to
talk
about
his
patients
orszay
was
an
excellent
talker
and
possessed
the
power
of
painting
a
personality
for
his
listeners
he
was
pleased
and
flattered
by
the
evident
interest
with
which
the
detective
listened
to
his
remarks
then
your
patients
are
all
quite
harmless
asked
muller
thoughtfully
when
the
doctor
came
to
a
pause
yes
all
quite
harmless
of
course
there
is
the
man
who
strangely
enough
considers
himself
the
reincarnation
of
the
famous
french
murderer
the
goldsmith
cardillac
who
as
you
remember
kept
all
paris
in
a
fervour
of
excitement
by
his
crimes
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
but
in
spite
of
his
weird
mania
this
man
is
the
most
of
any
he
has
been
shut
up
in
his
room
for
several
days
now
he
was
a
mechanician
by
trade
living
in
budapest
and
an
unsuccessful
invention
turned
his
is
he
a
large
powerful
man
asked
muller
orszay
looked
a
bit
surprised
why
do
you
ask
that
he
does
happen
to
be
a
large
man
of
considerable
strength
but
in
spite
of
it
i
have
no
fear
of
him
i
have
an
attendant
who
is
invaluable
to
me
a
man
of
such
strength
that
even
the
fiercest
of
them
can
not
overcome
him
and
yet
with
a
mind
and
a
personal
magnetism
which
they
can
not
resist
he
can
always
master
our
patients
mentally
and
physically
most
of
them
are
afraid
of
him
and
they
know
that
they
must
do
as
he
says
there
is
something
in
his
very
glance
which
has
the
power
to
paralyse
even
healthy
nerves
for
it
shows
the
strength
of
will
possessed
by
this
and
what
is
the
name
of
this
invaluable
attendant
asked
muller
with
a
strange
smile
which
the
doctor
took
to
be
slightly
ironical
gyuri
kovacz
you
are
amused
at
my
enthusiasm
but
consider
my
position
here
i
am
an
old
man
and
have
never
been
a
strong
man
at
my
age
i
would
not
have
strength
enough
to
force
that
little
woman
there
she
thinks
herself
possessed
and
is
quite
cranky
at
times
to
go
to
her
own
room
when
she
doesn
t
want
to
and
do
you
see
that
man
over
there
in
the
blue
blouse
he
is
an
excellent
gardener
but
he
believes
himself
to
be
napoleon
and
when
he
has
his
acute
attacks
i
would
be
helpless
to
control
him
were
it
not
for
and
you
are
not
afraid
of
cardillac
interrupted
muller
not
in
the
least
he
is
as
as
a
child
and
as
confiding
i
can
let
him
walk
around
here
as
much
as
he
likes
if
it
were
not
for
the
absurd
nonsense
that
he
talks
when
he
has
one
of
his
attacks
and
which
frightens
those
who
do
not
understand
him
i
could
let
him
go
free
then
you
never
let
him
leave
the
asylum
grounds
oh
yes
i
take
him
out
with
me
very
frequently
he
is
a
man
of
considerable
education
and
a
very
clever
talker
it
is
quite
a
pleasure
to
be
with
him
that
was
the
opinion
of
my
poor
friend
also
my
poor
murdered
the
pastor
the
pastor
he
often
invited
cardillac
to
come
to
the
rectory
with
indeed
then
cardillac
knew
the
inside
of
the
rectory
yes
the
pastor
used
to
lend
him
books
and
let
him
choose
them
himself
from
the
library
shelves
the
people
in
the
village
are
very
kind
to
my
poor
patients
here
i
have
long
since
had
the
habit
of
taking
some
of
the
quieter
ones
with
me
down
into
the
village
and
letting
the
people
become
acquainted
with
them
it
is
good
for
both
parties
it
gives
the
patients
some
little
diversion
and
it
takes
away
the
worst
of
the
senseless
fear
these
peasants
had
at
first
of
the
asylum
and
its
inmates
cardillac
in
particular
is
always
welcome
when
he
comes
for
he
brings
the
children
all
sorts
of
toys
that
he
makes
in
his
the
detective
had
listened
attentively
and
once
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
lips
shut
tight
as
if
to
keep
in
the
betraying
whistle
then
he
asked
calmly
but
the
patients
are
only
allowed
to
go
out
when
you
accompany
them
i
suppose
oh
no
the
attendants
take
them
out
sometimes
i
prefer
however
to
let
them
go
only
with
gyuri
for
i
can
depend
upon
him
more
than
upon
any
of
the
then
he
and
cardillac
have
been
out
together
occasionally
oh
yes
quite
frequently
but
pardon
me
this
is
almost
like
a
i
beg
your
pardon
doctor
it
s
a
bad
habit
of
mine
one
gets
so
accustomed
to
it
in
my
what
is
it
you
want
asked
doctor
orszay
turning
to
a
young
man
of
superb
build
who
entered
just
then
and
stood
by
the
door
i
just
wanted
to
announce
sir
that
no
is
quiet
again
is
cardillac
himself
muller
or
to
give
him
his
right
name
lajos
varna
explained
the
doctor
turning
to
his
guest
he
is
the
patient
who
has
been
received
here
in
these
twenty
years
then
cardillac
is
quiet
again
he
asked
looking
up
at
the
young
giant
i
am
glad
of
that
you
can
announce
our
visit
to
him
this
gentleman
wants
to
inspect
the
muller
realised
that
this
was
the
attendant
gyuri
and
he
looked
at
him
attentively
he
was
soon
clear
in
his
own
mind
that
this
remarkably
handsome
man
did
not
please
him
in
fact
awoke
in
him
a
feeling
of
repulsion
the
attendant
s
quiet
almost
movements
were
in
strange
contrast
to
the
massivity
of
his
superb
frame
and
his
large
round
eyes
shaped
for
open
honest
glances
were
shifty
and
cunning
they
seemed
to
be
asking
are
you
trying
to
discover
anything
about
me
coupled
with
a
threat
for
your
own
sake
you
had
better
not
do
when
the
young
man
had
left
the
room
muller
rose
hastily
and
walked
up
and
down
several
times
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
lips
tight
set
suddenly
he
exclaimed
i
do
not
like
this
orszay
looked
up
astonished
there
are
many
others
who
do
not
like
him
most
of
his
for
instance
and
all
of
the
patients
i
think
there
must
be
something
in
the
contrast
of
such
quiet
movements
with
such
a
big
body
that
gets
on
people
s
nerves
but
consider
muller
that
the
man
s
work
would
naturally
make
him
a
little
different
from
other
people
i
have
known
gyuri
for
five
years
as
a
faithful
and
unassuming
servant
always
willing
and
ready
for
any
duty
however
difficult
or
dangerous
he
has
but
one
fault
if
i
may
call
it
such
that
is
that
he
has
a
mistress
who
is
known
to
be
mercenary
and
she
lives
in
a
neighbouring
for
five
years
you
say
and
how
long
has
cardillac
been
here
cardillac
he
has
been
here
for
almost
three
for
almost
three
years
and
is
it
not
almost
three
years
muller
interrupted
himself
are
we
quite
alone
is
no
one
listening
the
doctor
nodded
greatly
surprised
and
the
detective
continued
almost
in
a
whisper
and
it
is
just
about
three
years
now
that
there
have
been
committed
at
intervals
three
terrible
crimes
notable
from
the
cleverness
with
which
they
were
carried
out
and
from
the
utter
impossibility
apparently
of
discovering
the
orszay
sprang
up
his
face
flushed
and
then
grew
livid
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
then
he
forced
a
smile
and
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
in
spite
of
himself
mr
muller
your
imagination
is
wonderful
and
which
of
these
two
do
you
think
it
is
that
has
committed
these
crimes
the
perpetrator
of
which
you
have
come
here
to
find
i
will
tell
you
that
later
i
must
speak
to
no
first
and
i
must
speak
to
him
in
the
presence
of
yourself
and
the
detective
s
deep
gravity
was
contagious
orszay
had
sufficiently
controlled
himself
to
remember
what
he
had
heard
in
former
days
and
just
now
recently
from
the
district
judge
about
this
man
s
marvellous
deeds
he
realised
that
when
muller
said
a
thing
no
matter
how
extravagant
it
might
sound
it
was
worth
taking
seriously
this
realisation
brought
great
uneasiness
and
grief
to
the
doctor
s
heart
for
he
had
grown
fond
of
both
of
the
men
on
whom
terrible
suspicion
was
cast
by
such
an
authority
muller
himself
was
uneasy
but
the
gloom
that
had
hung
over
him
for
the
past
day
or
two
had
vanished
the
impenetrable
darkness
that
had
surrounded
the
mystery
of
the
pastor
s
murder
had
gotten
on
his
nerves
he
was
not
accustomed
to
work
so
long
over
a
problem
without
getting
some
light
on
it
but
now
since
the
chance
watching
of
the
spinning
top
in
the
street
had
given
him
his
first
inkling
of
the
trail
he
was
following
it
up
to
a
clear
issue
the
eagerness
the
blissful
vibrating
of
every
nerve
that
he
always
felt
at
this
stage
of
the
game
was
on
him
again
he
knew
that
from
now
on
what
was
still
to
be
done
would
be
easy
hitherto
his
mind
had
been
made
up
on
one
point
that
one
man
alone
was
concerned
in
the
crime
now
he
understood
the
possibility
that
there
might
have
been
two
the
harmless
mechanician
who
fancied
himself
a
dangerous
murderer
and
the
handsome
young
giant
with
the
evil
eyes
the
two
men
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
a
silence
that
was
almost
hostile
had
this
stranger
come
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
refuge
for
the
unfortunate
and
to
prove
that
orszay
the
friend
of
all
the
village
had
unwittingly
been
giving
shelter
to
such
criminals
shall
we
go
now
asked
the
detective
finally
if
you
wish
it
sir
answered
the
doctor
in
a
tone
that
was
decidedly
cool
muller
held
out
his
hand
don
t
let
us
be
foolish
doctor
if
you
should
find
yourself
terribly
deceived
and
i
should
have
been
the
means
of
proving
it
promise
me
that
you
will
not
be
angry
with
orszay
pressed
the
offered
hand
with
a
deep
sigh
he
realised
the
other
s
position
and
knew
it
was
his
duty
to
give
him
every
possible
assistance
what
is
there
for
me
to
do
now
he
asked
sadly
you
must
see
that
all
the
patients
are
shut
up
in
their
cells
so
that
the
other
attendants
are
at
our
disposal
if
we
need
them
varna
s
room
has
barred
windows
i
suppose
and
i
suppose
also
that
it
has
but
one
door
i
believe
you
told
me
that
your
asylum
was
built
on
the
cell
yes
there
is
but
one
door
to
the
let
the
four
other
attendants
stand
outside
this
door
gyuri
will
be
inside
with
us
tell
the
men
outside
that
they
are
to
seize
and
hold
whomever
i
shall
designate
to
them
i
will
call
them
in
by
a
whistle
you
can
trust
your
people
yes
i
think
i
well
i
have
my
revolver
said
muller
calmly
and
now
we
can
they
left
the
room
together
and
found
gyuri
waiting
for
them
a
little
further
along
the
corridor
aren
t
you
well
sir
the
attendant
asked
the
doctor
with
an
anxious
note
in
his
voice
the
man
s
anxiety
was
not
feigned
he
was
really
a
faithful
servant
in
his
devotion
to
the
old
doctor
although
muller
had
not
misjudged
him
when
he
decided
that
this
young
giant
was
capable
of
anything
good
and
evil
often
lie
so
close
together
in
the
human
heart
the
doctor
s
emotion
prevented
him
from
speaking
and
the
detective
answered
in
his
place
it
is
a
sudden
indisposition
he
said
lead
me
to
no
who
is
waiting
for
us
i
suppose
the
doctor
wants
to
lie
down
a
moment
in
his
own
gyuri
glanced
distrustfully
at
this
man
whom
he
had
met
for
the
first
time
but
who
was
no
stranger
to
him
for
he
had
already
learned
the
identity
of
the
guest
in
the
rectory
then
he
turned
his
eyes
on
his
master
the
latter
nodded
and
said
take
the
gentleman
to
varna
s
room
i
will
follow
the
cell
to
which
they
went
was
the
first
one
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
extremely
convenient
thought
muller
to
himself
it
was
a
large
room
comfortably
furnished
and
filled
now
with
the
red
glow
of
the
setting
sun
a
stood
by
the
window
and
an
elderly
man
was
at
work
at
it
gyuri
called
to
him
and
he
turned
and
rose
when
he
saw
a
stranger
lajos
varna
was
a
tall
man
with
sallow
skin
and
tired
eyes
he
gave
only
a
hasty
glance
at
his
visitor
then
looked
at
gyuri
the
expression
in
his
eyes
as
he
turned
them
on
those
of
the
warder
was
like
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
a
dog
when
it
watches
its
master
s
face
gyuri
s
brows
were
drawn
close
together
and
his
mouth
set
tight
to
a
narrow
line
his
eyes
fairly
bored
themselves
into
the
patient
s
eyes
with
an
expression
like
that
of
a
hypnotiser
muller
knew
now
what
he
wanted
to
know
this
young
man
understood
how
to
bend
the
will
of
others
even
the
will
of
a
sick
mind
to
his
own
desires
the
little
silent
scene
he
had
watched
had
lasted
just
the
length
of
time
it
had
taken
the
detective
to
walk
through
the
room
and
hold
out
his
hand
to
the
patient
i
don
t
want
to
disturb
you
varna
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
with
a
motion
towards
the
bench
from
which
the
mechanician
had
just
arisen
varna
sat
down
again
obedient
as
a
child
he
was
not
always
so
apparently
for
muller
saw
a
red
mark
over
the
fingers
of
one
hand
that
was
evidently
the
mark
of
a
blow
gyuri
was
not
very
choice
in
the
methods
by
which
he
controlled
the
patients
confided
to
his
care
may
i
sit
down
also
asked
muller
varna
pushed
forward
a
chair
his
movements
were
like
those
of
an
automaton
and
now
tell
me
how
you
like
it
here
began
the
detective
varna
answered
with
a
low
soft
voice
oh
i
like
it
very
much
as
he
spoke
he
looked
up
at
gyuri
whose
eyes
still
bore
their
commanding
expression
they
treat
you
kindly
here
oh
the
doctor
is
very
good
to
you
ah
the
doctor
is
so
good
varna
s
dull
eyes
brightened
and
the
others
are
good
to
you
also
oh
the
momentary
gleam
in
the
sad
eye
had
vanished
again
where
did
you
get
this
red
scar
the
patient
became
uneasy
he
moved
anxiously
on
his
chair
and
looked
up
at
gyuri
it
was
evident
that
he
realised
there
would
be
more
red
marks
if
he
told
the
truth
to
this
stranger
muller
did
not
insist
upon
an
answer
you
are
uneasy
and
nervous
sometimes
aren
t
you
yes
sir
i
have
been
nervous
and
they
don
t
let
you
go
out
at
such
times
why
i
no
i
may
not
go
out
at
such
but
the
doctor
takes
you
with
him
sometimes
the
doctor
or
gyuri
asked
the
detective
i
haven
t
had
him
out
with
me
for
weeks
interrupted
the
attendant
he
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
have
the
for
weeks
clearly
heard
by
this
inconvenient
questioner
muller
dropped
this
subject
and
took
up
another
they
tell
me
you
are
very
fond
of
children
and
i
can
see
that
you
are
making
toys
for
them
yes
i
love
children
and
i
am
so
glad
they
are
not
afraid
of
these
words
were
spoken
with
more
warmth
and
greater
interest
than
anything
the
man
had
yet
said
and
they
tell
me
that
you
take
gifts
with
you
for
the
children
every
time
you
go
down
to
the
village
this
is
pretty
work
here
and
it
must
be
a
pleasant
diversion
for
muller
had
taken
up
a
dainty
little
which
was
almost
completed
isn
t
it
made
from
the
wood
of
a
red
yew
tree
yes
the
doctor
gave
me
a
whole
tree
that
had
been
cut
down
in
the
and
that
gave
you
wood
for
a
long
time
yes
indeed
i
have
been
making
toys
from
it
for
varna
had
become
quite
eager
and
interested
as
he
handed
his
visitor
a
number
of
pretty
trifles
the
two
had
risen
from
their
chairs
and
were
leaning
over
the
wide
window
seat
which
served
as
a
for
the
wares
turned
out
by
the
busy
workman
they
were
toys
mostly
all
sorts
of
little
pots
and
plates
dolls
furniture
balls
of
various
sizes
miniature
bowling
pins
and
tops
muller
took
up
one
of
the
latter
how
very
clever
you
are
and
how
industrious
he
exclaimed
sitting
down
again
and
turning
the
top
in
his
hands
it
was
covered
with
grey
varnish
with
tiny
little
yellow
stripes
painted
on
it
towards
the
lower
point
a
little
bit
of
the
varnish
had
been
broken
off
and
the
reddish
wood
underneath
was
visible
the
top
was
much
better
constructed
than
the
cheap
toys
sold
in
the
village
it
was
hollow
and
contained
in
its
interior
a
mechanism
started
by
a
pressure
on
the
upper
end
once
set
in
motion
the
little
top
spun
about
the
room
for
some
time
oh
isn
t
that
pretty
is
this
mechanism
your
own
invention
asked
muller
smiling
gyuri
watched
the
top
with
drawn
brows
and
murmured
something
about
childish
yes
it
is
my
own
invention
said
the
patient
flattered
he
started
out
on
an
absolutely
technical
explanation
of
the
mechanism
of
tops
in
general
and
of
his
own
in
particular
an
explanation
so
lucid
and
so
well
put
that
no
one
would
have
believed
the
man
who
was
speaking
was
not
in
possession
of
the
full
powers
of
his
mind
muller
listened
very
attentively
with
unfeigned
interest
but
you
have
made
more
important
inventions
than
this
haven
t
you
he
asked
when
the
other
stopped
talking
varna
s
eyes
flashed
and
his
voice
dropped
to
a
tone
of
mystery
as
he
answered
yes
indeed
i
have
but
i
did
not
have
time
to
finish
them
for
i
had
become
some
one
some
one
else
cardillac
whispered
varna
whose
mania
was
now
getting
the
best
of
him
again
cardillac
you
mean
the
notorious
goldsmith
who
lived
in
paris
years
ago
why
he
s
varna
s
pale
lips
curled
in
a
superior
smile
oh
yes
that
s
what
people
think
but
it
s
a
mistake
he
is
still
alive
i
am
i
have
although
of
course
there
isn
t
much
opportunity
here
gyuri
cleared
his
throat
with
a
rasping
noise
what
were
you
saying
friend
cardillac
asked
muller
with
a
great
show
of
interest
i
have
done
things
here
that
nobody
has
found
out
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
see
the
authorities
so
helpless
over
the
riddles
i
have
given
them
to
solve
oh
indeed
sir
you
would
never
imagine
how
stupid
they
are
in
other
words
friend
cardillac
you
are
too
clever
for
the
authorities
here
yes
that
s
it
said
the
insane
man
greatly
flattered
he
raised
his
head
proudly
and
smiled
down
at
his
guest
at
this
moment
the
doctor
came
into
the
room
and
gyuri
walked
forward
to
the
group
at
the
window
you
are
making
him
nervous
sir
he
said
to
muller
in
a
tone
that
was
almost
harsh
you
can
leave
that
to
me
answered
the
detective
calmly
and
you
will
please
place
yourself
behind
varna
s
chair
not
behind
mine
it
is
your
eyes
that
are
making
him
the
attendant
was
alarmed
and
lost
control
of
himself
for
a
moment
sir
he
exclaimed
in
an
outburst
my
name
is
muller
in
case
you
do
not
know
it
already
joseph
muller
detective
gyuri
kovacz
you
will
do
what
i
tell
you
to
i
am
master
here
just
now
is
it
not
so
doctor
yes
it
is
so
said
the
doctor
what
does
this
mean
murmured
gyuri
turning
pale
it
means
that
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
stand
up
against
that
wall
and
fold
your
arms
on
your
breast
said
muller
firmly
he
took
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
beside
him
on
the
the
young
giant
cowed
by
the
sight
of
the
weapon
obeyed
the
commands
of
this
little
man
whom
he
could
have
easily
crushed
with
a
single
blow
orszay
sank
down
on
the
chair
beside
the
door
muller
now
completely
master
of
the
situation
turned
to
the
insane
man
who
stood
looking
at
him
in
a
surprise
which
was
mingled
with
admiration
and
now
my
dear
cardillac
you
must
tell
us
of
your
great
deeds
here
said
the
detective
in
a
friendly
tone
the
unfortunate
man
bent
over
him
with
shining
eyes
and
whispered
but
you
ll
shoot
him
first
won
t
you
why
should
i
shoot
him
because
he
won
t
let
me
say
a
word
without
beating
me
he
is
so
cruel
he
sticks
pins
into
me
if
i
don
t
do
what
he
why
didn
t
you
tell
the
doctor
gyuri
would
have
treated
me
worse
than
ever
then
i
am
a
coward
sir
i
m
so
afraid
of
pain
and
he
knew
that
he
knew
that
i
was
afraid
of
being
hurt
and
that
i
d
always
do
what
he
asked
of
me
and
because
i
don
t
like
to
be
hurt
myself
i
always
finished
them
off
finished
who
why
there
was
red
betty
he
wanted
her
who
wanted
it
the
man
at
the
wall
moved
when
he
heard
this
terrible
accusation
but
the
detective
took
up
his
revolver
again
be
quiet
there
he
called
with
a
look
such
as
he
might
have
thrown
at
an
angry
dog
gyuri
stood
quiet
again
but
his
eyes
shot
flames
and
great
drops
stood
out
on
his
forehead
now
go
on
friend
cardillac
continued
the
detective
we
were
talking
about
red
i
strangled
her
she
did
not
even
know
she
was
dying
she
was
such
a
weak
old
woman
it
really
couldn
t
have
hurt
no
certainly
not
said
muller
soothingly
for
he
saw
that
the
thought
that
his
victim
might
have
suffered
was
beginning
to
make
the
madman
uneasy
you
needn
t
worry
about
that
old
betty
died
a
quiet
death
but
tell
me
how
did
gyuri
know
that
she
had
money
the
whole
village
knew
it
she
laid
cards
for
people
and
earned
a
lot
of
money
that
way
she
was
very
stingy
and
saved
every
bit
somebody
saw
her
counting
out
her
money
once
she
had
it
in
a
big
stocking
under
her
bed
people
in
the
village
talked
about
it
that
s
how
gyuri
heard
of
and
so
he
commanded
you
to
kill
betty
and
steal
her
money
yes
he
knew
that
i
loved
to
give
them
riddles
to
guess
just
as
i
did
in
paris
so
long
oh
yes
you
re
cardillac
aren
t
you
and
now
tell
us
about
the
smith
s
you
mean
janos
oh
he
was
a
stupid
lout
answered
varna
scornfully
he
had
cast
an
eye
on
the
beautiful
julcsi
gyuri
s
mistress
so
of
course
i
had
to
kill
did
you
do
that
alone
no
gyuri
helped
why
did
you
cut
the
bridge
supports
because
i
enjoy
giving
people
riddles
as
i
told
you
but
gyuri
forbade
me
to
kill
people
uselessly
i
liked
the
chance
of
getting
out
though
the
doctor
s
so
good
to
me
and
the
others
too
gyuri
is
good
to
me
when
i
have
done
what
he
wanted
but
you
see
muller
i
am
like
a
prisoner
here
and
that
makes
me
angry
i
made
gyuri
let
me
out
nights
you
mean
he
let
you
out
alone
all
alone
yes
of
course
for
i
threatened
to
tell
the
doctor
everything
if
he
didn
you
wouldn
t
have
dared
do
no
that
s
true
smiled
varna
slyly
but
gyuri
was
afraid
i
might
do
it
for
he
isn
t
always
strong
enough
to
frighten
me
with
his
eyes
those
were
the
hours
when
i
could
make
him
afraid
i
liked
those
hours
what
did
you
do
when
you
were
out
alone
at
night
i
just
walked
about
i
set
fire
to
a
tree
in
the
woods
once
then
the
rain
came
and
put
it
out
once
i
killed
a
dog
and
another
time
i
cut
through
the
bridge
supports
that
took
me
several
hours
to
do
and
made
me
very
tired
but
it
was
such
fun
to
know
that
people
would
be
worrying
and
fussing
about
who
did
varna
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
he
did
not
look
the
least
bit
malicious
but
only
very
much
amused
the
doctor
groaned
gyuri
s
great
body
trembled
his
arms
shook
but
he
did
not
make
a
single
voluntary
movement
he
saw
the
revolver
in
muller
s
hand
and
felt
the
keen
grey
eyes
resting
on
him
in
pitiless
calm
and
now
tell
us
about
the
pastor
said
the
detective
in
a
firm
clear
voice
oh
he
was
a
dear
good
gentleman
said
no
with
an
expression
of
pitying
sorrow
on
his
face
i
owed
him
much
gratitude
that
s
why
i
put
the
roses
in
his
yes
but
you
murdered
him
of
course
gyuri
told
me
and
why
he
hated
the
pastor
for
the
old
gentleman
had
no
confidence
in
is
this
true
muller
turned
to
the
doctor
i
did
not
notice
it
said
orszay
with
a
voice
that
showed
deep
sorrow
and
you
muller
s
eyes
bored
themselves
into
the
orbs
of
the
young
giant
now
dulled
with
fear
gyuri
started
and
shivered
he
looked
at
me
sharply
every
now
and
then
he
murmured
and
that
was
why
he
was
killed
the
warder
s
head
sank
on
his
breast
no
not
only
for
that
reason
continued
no
gyuri
needed
money
again
he
ordered
me
to
bring
him
the
silver
candlesticks
off
the
murder
and
sacrilege
said
the
detective
calmly
no
i
did
not
rob
the
church
when
i
had
buried
the
reverend
gentleman
i
heard
the
cock
crowing
i
was
afraid
i
might
get
home
here
too
late
and
i
forgot
the
candlesticks
i
had
to
stop
to
wash
my
hands
in
the
brook
while
i
was
there
i
saw
shepherd
janci
coming
along
and
i
hid
behind
the
willows
he
almost
discovered
me
once
but
janci
s
a
dreamer
he
sees
things
nobody
else
sees
and
he
doesn
t
see
things
that
everybody
else
does
see
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
his
sleepy
face
but
i
didn
t
laugh
when
i
came
back
to
the
asylum
gyuri
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
when
he
saw
that
i
hadn
t
brought
the
candlesticks
he
beat
me
and
tortured
me
worse
than
he
d
ever
done
and
you
didn
t
tell
anyone
why
no
because
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
told
on
him
i
d
never
be
able
to
go
out
and
you
quite
alone
could
carry
the
pastor
s
body
out
of
his
room
i
am
very
how
did
you
arrange
it
that
there
should
be
no
traces
of
blood
to
betray
you
i
waited
until
the
body
had
stiffened
then
i
tied
up
the
wound
and
carried
him
down
into
the
why
did
you
do
that
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
him
in
that
horrid
pool
of
you
were
sorry
for
him
then
why
yes
it
looked
so
horrid
to
see
him
lying
there
and
he
had
always
been
so
good
to
me
he
was
so
good
to
me
that
very
evening
when
i
entered
his
study
he
recognised
you
certainly
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
when
i
came
in
through
the
passage
from
the
church
i
saw
that
he
was
startled
but
he
smiled
at
me
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
me
and
said
what
brings
you
here
my
dear
cardillac
and
then
i
struck
i
wanted
him
to
die
with
that
smile
on
his
lips
it
is
beautiful
to
see
a
man
die
smiling
it
shows
that
he
has
not
been
afraid
of
death
he
was
dead
at
once
i
always
kill
that
way
i
know
just
how
to
strike
and
where
i
killed
more
than
a
hundred
people
years
ago
in
paris
and
i
didn
t
leave
one
of
them
the
time
for
even
a
sigh
i
was
renowned
for
that
i
had
a
kind
heart
and
a
sure
muller
interrupted
the
dreadful
imaginings
of
the
madman
with
a
question
you
got
into
the
house
through
the
crypt
yes
through
the
crypt
i
found
the
window
one
night
when
i
was
prowling
around
in
the
churchyard
when
i
knew
that
the
pastor
was
to
be
the
next
i
cut
through
the
window
bars
gyuri
went
into
the
church
one
day
when
nobody
was
there
and
found
out
that
it
was
easy
to
lift
the
stone
over
the
entrance
to
the
crypt
he
also
learned
that
the
doors
from
the
church
to
the
vestry
were
never
locked
i
knew
how
to
find
the
passageway
because
i
had
been
through
it
several
times
on
my
visits
to
the
rectory
but
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
the
door
into
the
pastor
s
study
was
a
chance
that
cost
the
life
of
a
worthy
man
said
the
detective
gravely
varna
nodded
sadly
but
he
didn
t
suffer
he
was
dead
at
and
now
tell
me
what
this
top
was
doing
there
no
looked
at
the
detective
in
great
surprise
and
then
laid
his
hand
on
the
latter
s
arm
how
did
you
know
that
i
had
the
top
there
he
asked
with
a
show
of
interest
i
found
its
traces
in
the
room
and
it
was
those
traces
that
led
me
here
to
you
answered
muller
how
strange
remarked
varna
are
you
like
shepherd
janci
that
you
can
see
the
things
others
don
t
see
no
i
have
not
janci
s
gift
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
and
a
help
to
the
others
perhaps
if
i
had
i
can
only
see
things
after
they
have
but
you
can
see
more
than
others
the
others
did
not
see
the
traces
of
the
top
my
business
is
to
see
more
than
others
see
said
muller
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
what
the
top
was
doing
there
why
did
you
take
a
toy
like
that
with
you
when
you
went
out
on
such
an
errand
it
was
in
my
pocket
by
chance
when
i
reached
for
my
handkerchief
to
quench
the
flow
of
blood
the
top
came
out
with
it
i
must
have
touched
the
spring
without
knowing
it
for
the
top
began
to
spin
i
stood
still
and
watched
it
then
i
ran
after
it
it
spun
around
the
room
and
finally
came
back
to
the
body
so
did
i
the
pastor
was
quite
still
and
dead
by
that
you
have
heard
everything
orszay
asked
the
detective
rising
from
his
chair
yes
i
have
heard
everything
answered
the
venerable
head
of
the
asylum
he
was
utterly
crushed
by
the
realisation
that
all
this
tragedy
and
horror
had
gone
out
from
his
house
varna
rose
also
he
understood
perfectly
that
now
gyuri
s
power
was
at
an
end
and
he
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
that
has
just
received
a
present
and
now
you
re
going
to
shoot
him
he
asked
in
the
tone
a
boy
would
use
if
asking
when
the
fireworks
were
to
begin
muller
shook
his
head
no
my
dear
cardillac
he
replied
gravely
he
will
not
be
shot
that
is
a
death
for
a
brave
soldier
but
this
man
has
deserved
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
the
warder
sank
to
the
floor
unconscious
what
a
coward
murmured
the
detective
scornfully
looking
down
at
the
giant
frame
that
lay
prostrate
before
him
even
in
his
wide
experience
he
had
known
of
no
case
of
a
man
of
such
strength
and
such
bestial
cruelty
combined
with
such
utter
cowardice
varna
also
stood
looking
down
at
the
unconscious
warder
then
he
glanced
up
with
a
cunning
smile
at
the
other
two
men
who
stood
there
the
doctor
pale
and
trembling
with
horror
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
muller
turned
to
the
door
to
call
in
the
attendants
waiting
outside
during
the
moment
s
pause
that
ensued
the
madman
bent
over
his
worktable
seized
a
knife
that
lay
there
and
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
the
prostrate
form
his
hand
was
raised
to
strike
when
a
calm
voice
said
fie
cardillac
for
shame
do
not
belittle
yourself
this
man
here
is
not
worthy
of
your
knife
the
hangman
will
look
after
varna
raised
his
frame
and
looked
about
with
glistening
eyes
and
trembling
lips
his
mind
was
completely
darkened
once
more
i
must
kill
him
i
must
have
his
blood
there
is
no
one
to
see
me
he
murmured
i
am
a
hangman
too
he
has
made
a
hangman
of
me
and
again
he
bent
with
uplifted
hand
over
the
man
who
had
utilised
his
terrible
misfortune
to
make
a
criminal
of
him
but
two
of
the
waiting
attendants
seized
his
arms
and
threw
him
back
on
the
floor
while
the
other
two
carted
gyuri
out
both
unfortunates
were
soon
securely
guarded
do
not
be
angry
with
me
doctor
said
muller
gravely
as
he
walked
through
the
garden
accompanied
by
orszay
doctor
orszay
laughed
bitterly
why
should
i
be
angry
with
you
you
who
have
discovered
my
inexcusable
credulity
inexcusable
oh
no
doctor
it
was
quite
natural
that
you
should
have
believed
a
man
who
had
himself
so
well
in
hand
and
who
knew
so
well
how
to
play
his
part
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
we
realise
that
most
crimes
have
been
made
possible
through
some
one
s
credulity
or
a
credulity
which
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
seems
quite
incomprehensible
do
not
reproach
yourself
and
do
not
lose
heart
your
only
fault
was
that
you
did
not
recognise
the
heart
of
the
beast
of
prey
in
this
admirable
human
what
course
will
the
law
take
asked
orszay
the
poor
unfortunate
madman
whose
knife
took
all
these
lives
can
not
be
held
responsible
can
he
oh
no
his
misfortune
protects
him
but
as
for
the
other
though
his
hands
bear
no
actual
bloodstains
he
is
more
truly
a
murderer
than
the
unhappy
man
who
was
his
tool
hanging
is
too
good
for
him
there
are
times
when
even
i
could
wish
that
we
were
back
in
the
middle
ages
when
it
was
possible
to
torture
a
prisoner
you
do
not
look
like
that
sort
of
a
man
smiled
the
doctor
through
his
sadness
no
i
am
the
most
of
men
usually
i
think
the
meekest
anyway
answered
muller
but
a
case
like
this
however
as
i
said
before
keep
a
stout
heart
doctor
and
do
not
waste
time
in
unnecessary
the
detective
pressed
the
doctor
s
hand
warmly
and
walked
down
the
hill
towards
the
village
he
went
at
once
to
the
office
of
the
magistrate
and
made
his
report
then
returned
to
the
rectory
and
packed
his
grip
he
arranged
for
its
transport
to
the
railway
station
as
he
himself
preferred
to
walk
the
inconsiderable
distance
he
passed
through
the
village
and
had
just
entered
the
open
fields
when
he
met
janci
with
his
flock
the
shepherd
hastened
his
steps
when
he
saw
the
detective
approaching
you
have
found
him
sir
he
exclaimed
as
he
came
up
to
muller
the
men
had
come
to
be
friends
by
this
time
the
silent
shepherd
with
the
power
of
second
sight
had
won
muller
s
interest
at
once
yes
i
found
him
it
is
gyuri
the
warder
at
the
no
sir
it
is
not
gyuri
gyuri
did
not
do
but
when
i
tell
you
that
he
did
but
i
tell
you
sir
that
gyuri
did
not
do
it
the
man
who
did
it
he
has
yellowish
hands
i
saw
them
i
saw
big
yellowish
hands
gyuri
s
hands
are
big
but
they
are
janci
you
are
right
i
was
only
trying
to
test
you
gyuri
did
not
do
it
that
is
he
did
not
do
it
with
his
own
hands
the
man
who
held
the
knife
that
struck
down
the
pastor
was
varna
the
crazy
janci
beat
his
forehead
oh
i
am
a
foolish
and
useless
dreamer
he
exclaimed
of
course
it
was
varna
s
hands
that
i
saw
i
have
seen
them
a
hundred
times
when
he
came
down
into
the
village
and
yet
when
i
saw
them
in
the
vision
i
did
not
recognise
we
re
all
dreamers
janci
and
our
dreams
are
very
useless
yours
are
not
useless
sir
said
the
shepherd
if
i
had
as
much
brains
as
you
have
my
dreams
might
be
of
some
muller
smiled
and
if
i
had
your
visions
janci
it
would
be
a
powerful
aid
to
me
in
my
i
don
t
think
you
need
them
sir
you
can
find
out
the
hidden
things
without
them
you
are
going
to
leave
us
yes
janci
i
must
go
back
to
budapest
and
from
there
to
vienna
they
need
me
on
another
it
s
a
sad
work
this
bringing
people
to
the
gallows
isn
t
it
yes
janci
it
is
sometimes
but
it
s
a
good
thing
to
be
able
to
avenge
crime
and
bring
justice
to
the
injured
sir
and
god
speed
the
shepherd
stood
looking
after
the
small
slight
figure
of
the
man
who
walked
on
rapidly
through
the
heather
he
s
the
right
one
for
the
work
murmured
janci
as
he
turned
slowly
back
towards
the
village
an
hour
later
muller
stood
in
the
little
of
the
railway
station
writing
a
telegram
it
was
addressed
to
count
do
you
know
the
shepherd
janci
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
make
him
the
official
detective
for
the
village
he
has
high
qualifications
for
the
profession
if
i
had
his
gifts
combined
with
my
own
not
one
could
escape
me
i
have
found
this
one
however
the
guards
are
already
taking
him
to
you
my
work
here
is
done
if
i
should
be
needed
again
i
can
be
found
at
police
headquarters
vienna
respectfully
joseph
while
the
detective
was
writing
his
message
it
was
one
of
the
rare
moments
of
humour
that
muller
allowed
himself
and
he
wondered
mildly
what
the
stately
hungarian
nobleman
would
think
of
it
a
heavy
farm
wagon
jolted
over
the
country
roads
towards
the
little
county
seat
sitting
beside
the
driver
and
riding
about
the
wagon
were
armed
peasants
the
figure
of
a
man
securely
bound
his
face
distorted
by
rage
and
fear
lay
in
the
wagon
it
was
gyuri
kovacz
who
had
murdered
by
the
hands
of
another
and
who
was
now
on
his
way
to
meet
the
death
that
was
his
due
and
at
one
of
the
barred
windows
in
the
big
yellow
house
stood
a
man
looking
out
at
the
rising
moon
with
sad
tired
eyes
his
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
like
that
of
a
dreaming
child
and
he
hummed
a
gentle
lullaby
in
his
compartment
of
the
express
from
budapest
to
vienna
joseph
muller
sat
thinking
over
the
strange
events
that
had
called
him
to
the
obscure
little
hungarian
village
he
had
met
with
many
strange
cases
in
his
long
career
but
this
particular
case
had
some
features
which
were
unique
muller
s
lips
set
hard
and
his
hands
tightened
to
fists
as
he
murmured
i
ve
met
with
criminals
who
used
strange
tools
but
never
before
have
i
met
with
one
who
had
the
cunning
and
the
incredible
cruelty
to
utilise
the
mania
of
an
unhinged
human
mind
it
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
those
criminals
who
now
and
then
throughout
the
ages
have
trained
brute
beasts
to
murder
for
them
truly
this
hungarian
peasant
gyuri
kovacz
deserves
a
high
place
in
the
infamous
of
the
great
criminals
of
history
a
student
of
crime
might
almost
be
led
to
think
that
it
is
a
pity
his
career
has
been
cut
short
so
soon
he
might
have
gone
far
but
for
humanity
s
sake
muller
s
eyes
gleamed
i
am
thankful
that
i
was
able
to
discover
this
beast
in
human
form
and
render
him
innocuous
he
had
done
quite
enough
