of
the
shadow
at
the
white
gate
the
roadmender
chapter
i
i
have
attained
my
ideal
i
am
a
roadmender
some
say
stonebreaker
both
titles
are
correct
but
the
one
is
more
pregnant
than
the
other
all
day
i
sit
by
the
roadside
on
a
stretch
of
grass
under
a
high
hedge
of
saplings
and
a
tangle
of
traveller
s
joy
woodbine
sweetbrier
and
late
roses
opposite
me
is
a
white
gate
seldom
used
if
one
may
judge
from
the
trail
of
honeysuckle
growing
tranquilly
along
it
i
know
now
that
whenever
and
wherever
i
die
my
soul
will
pass
out
through
this
white
gate
and
then
thank
god
i
shall
not
have
need
to
undo
that
trail
in
our
youth
we
discussed
our
ideals
freely
i
wonder
how
many
beside
myself
have
attained
or
would
understand
my
attaining
after
all
what
do
we
ask
of
life
here
or
indeed
hereafter
but
leave
to
serve
to
live
to
commune
with
our
fellowmen
and
with
ourselves
and
from
the
lap
of
earth
to
look
up
into
the
face
of
god
all
these
gifts
are
mine
as
i
sit
by
the
winding
white
road
and
serve
the
footsteps
of
my
fellows
there
is
no
room
in
my
life
for
avarice
or
anxiety
i
who
serve
at
the
altar
live
of
the
altar
i
lack
nothing
but
have
nothing
over
and
when
the
winter
of
life
comes
i
shall
join
the
company
of
weary
old
men
who
sit
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
workhouse
wall
and
wait
for
the
tender
mercies
of
god
just
now
it
is
the
summer
of
things
there
is
life
and
music
the
stones
themselves
and
i
live
beating
out
the
rhythmical
of
the
ring
there
is
real
physical
joy
in
the
rise
and
swing
of
the
arm
in
the
jar
of
a
fair
stroke
the
split
and
scatter
of
the
quartz
i
am
learning
to
be
ambidextrous
for
why
should
esau
sell
his
birthright
when
there
is
enough
for
both
then
the
comes
bringing
the
luxurious
ache
of
tired
but
not
weary
limbs
and
i
lie
outstretched
and
renew
my
strength
sometimes
with
my
face
in
the
cool
green
grass
sometimes
on
my
back
looking
up
into
the
blue
sky
which
no
wise
man
would
wish
to
fathom
the
birds
have
no
fear
of
me
am
i
not
also
of
the
brown
brethren
in
my
sober
fustian
livery
they
share
my
least
the
little
franciscans
do
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
care
not
a
whit
for
such
simple
food
as
crumbs
but
with
legs
well
apart
and
claws
tense
with
purchase
they
disinter
poor
brother
worm
having
first
mocked
him
with
sound
of
rain
the
robin
that
lives
by
the
gate
regards
my
heap
of
stones
as
subject
to
his
special
inspection
he
sits
atop
and
practises
the
trill
of
his
summer
song
until
it
shrills
above
and
through
the
metallic
clang
of
my
strokes
and
when
i
pause
he
cocks
his
tail
with
a
humorous
twinkle
of
his
round
eye
which
what
shirking
big
brother
i
fall
ashamed
to
my
mending
of
roads
the
other
day
as
i
lay
with
my
face
in
the
grass
i
heard
a
gentle
rustle
and
raised
my
head
to
find
a
watching
me
fearless
unwinking
i
stretched
out
my
hand
picked
it
up
unresisting
and
put
it
in
my
coat
like
the
husbandman
of
old
was
he
so
i
wonder
with
the
kiss
that
reveals
secrets
my
snake
slept
in
peace
while
i
hammered
away
with
an
odd
quickening
of
heart
as
i
thought
how
to
me
as
to
melampus
had
come
the
come
but
to
ears
deafened
by
centuries
of
misrule
blindness
and
oppression
so
that
with
all
my
longing
i
am
shut
out
of
the
wondrous
world
where
walked
melampus
and
the
saint
to
me
there
is
no
suggestion
of
evil
in
the
little
silent
creatures
harmless
or
deadly
only
with
the
death
which
is
life
the
beasts
who
turn
upon
us
as
a
rule
maul
and
tear
unreflectingly
with
the
snake
there
is
the
swift
silent
strike
the
tiny
tiny
wound
then
sleep
and
a
forgetting
my
brown
friend
with
its
message
unspoken
slid
away
into
the
grass
at
sundown
to
tell
its
tale
in
unstopped
ears
and
i
my
task
done
went
home
across
the
fields
to
the
solitary
cottage
where
i
lodge
it
is
old
and
rooms
with
a
over
them
reached
by
a
ladder
from
the
kitchen
and
reached
only
by
me
it
is
furnished
with
the
luxuries
of
life
a
truckle
bed
table
chair
and
huge
earthenware
pan
which
i
fill
from
the
well
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
morning
and
night
i
serve
with
the
gibeonites
their
curse
my
blessing
as
no
doubt
it
was
theirs
when
their
hearts
were
purged
by
service
morning
and
night
i
send
down
the
bucket
with
its
urgent
message
from
a
dry
and
dusty
world
the
chain
tightens
through
my
hand
as
the
liquid
treasure
responds
to
the
messenger
and
then
with
creak
and
welcome
of
labouring
bucket
slowly
nears
the
top
and
disperses
the
treasure
in
the
waiting
vessels
the
gibeonites
were
servants
in
the
house
of
god
ministers
of
the
sacrament
of
service
even
as
the
high
priest
himself
and
i
sharing
their
high
office
of
servitude
thank
god
that
the
ground
was
accursed
for
my
sake
for
surely
that
curse
was
the
womb
of
all
unborn
blessing
the
old
widow
with
whom
i
lodge
has
been
deaf
for
the
last
twenty
years
she
speaks
in
the
strained
high
voice
which
protests
against
her
own
infirmity
and
her
eyes
have
the
pathetic
look
of
those
who
search
in
silence
for
many
years
she
lived
alone
with
her
son
who
laboured
on
the
farm
two
miles
away
he
met
his
death
rescuing
a
carthorse
from
its
burning
stable
and
the
farmer
gave
the
cottage
rent
free
and
a
weekly
for
life
to
the
poor
old
woman
whose
dearest
terror
was
the
workhouse
with
my
shilling
a
week
rent
and
sharing
of
supplies
we
live
in
the
lines
of
comfort
of
death
she
has
no
fears
for
in
the
long
chest
in
the
kitchen
lie
a
web
of
coarse
white
linen
two
pennies
covered
with
the
same
to
keep
down
tired
eyelids
decent
white
stockings
and
a
white
cotton
decorous
enough
money
in
the
little
bag
for
burial
the
farmer
buried
his
servant
man
he
knew
the
love
of
reticent
grief
for
a
kind
one
day
harry
s
mother
is
to
lie
beside
him
in
the
little
churchyard
which
has
been
a
cornfield
and
may
some
day
be
one
again
chapter
ii
on
sundays
my
feet
take
ever
the
same
way
first
my
temple
service
and
then
five
miles
tramp
over
the
tender
dewy
fields
with
their
ineffable
earthy
smell
until
i
reach
the
little
church
at
the
foot
of
the
down
here
every
sunday
a
young
priest
from
a
neighbouring
village
says
mass
for
the
tiny
hamlet
where
all
are
very
old
or
very
the
heyday
of
life
has
no
part
under
the
long
shadow
of
the
hills
but
is
away
at
sea
or
in
service
there
is
a
beautiful
seemliness
in
the
extreme
youth
of
the
priest
who
serves
these
aged
children
of
god
he
bends
to
communicate
them
with
the
reverent
tenderness
of
a
son
and
reads
with
the
careful
intonation
of
love
to
the
old
people
he
is
the
son
of
their
old
age
to
guide
their
tottering
footsteps
along
the
highway
of
foolish
wayfarers
and
he
with
his
youth
and
strength
wishes
no
better
task
service
ended
we
greet
each
other
men
should
not
be
strange
in
the
acre
of
god
and
i
pass
through
the
little
hamlet
and
out
and
up
on
the
grey
down
beyond
here
at
the
last
gate
i
pause
for
breakfast
and
then
up
and
on
with
quickening
pulse
and
evergreen
memory
of
the
weary
greeks
who
broke
rank
to
greet
the
great
blue
that
led
to
home
i
stand
on
the
summit
hatless
the
wind
in
my
hair
the
smack
of
salt
on
my
cheek
all
round
me
rolling
stretches
of
down
no
sound
but
the
shrill
mourn
of
the
peewit
and
the
gathering
of
the
sea
the
hours
pass
the
shadows
lengthen
the
clang
and
i
lie
in
my
niche
under
the
stunted
hawthorn
watching
the
to
and
fro
of
the
sea
and
Ã¦olus
shepherding
his
white
sheep
across
the
blue
i
love
the
sea
with
its
impenetrable
fathoms
its
wash
and
undertow
and
rasp
of
shingle
sucked
anew
i
love
it
for
its
secret
dead
in
the
caverns
of
peace
of
which
account
must
be
given
when
the
books
are
opened
and
earth
and
heaven
have
fled
away
yet
in
my
love
there
is
a
paradox
for
as
i
watch
the
restless
ineffective
waves
i
think
of
the
measureless
reflective
depths
of
the
still
and
silent
sea
of
glass
of
the
dead
small
and
great
rich
or
poor
with
the
works
which
follow
them
and
of
the
voice
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
when
the
multitude
of
one
mind
rends
heaven
with
alleluia
and
i
lie
so
still
that
i
almost
feel
the
kiss
of
white
peace
on
my
mouth
later
still
when
the
flare
of
the
sinking
sun
has
died
away
and
the
stars
rise
out
of
a
veil
of
purple
cloud
i
take
my
way
home
down
the
slopes
through
the
hamlet
and
across
miles
of
sleeping
fields
over
which
night
has
thrown
her
shifting
web
of
to
the
little
attic
the
deep
cool
well
the
kindly
wrinkled
face
with
its
listening
in
my
heart
and
thankfulness
for
the
rhythm
of
the
road
monday
brings
the
joy
of
work
second
only
to
the
sabbath
of
rest
and
i
settle
to
my
heap
by
the
white
gate
soon
i
hear
the
distant
stamp
of
horsehoofs
heralding
the
grind
and
roll
of
the
wheels
which
reaches
me
heavy
with
a
team
of
four
great
gentle
horses
gay
with
brass
trappings
and
scarlet
on
the
top
of
the
craftily
piled
sacks
lies
the
waggoner
a
pink
in
his
mouth
which
he
mumbles
meditatively
and
the
reins
looped
over
the
inactive
should
he
drive
a
willing
team
that
knows
the
journey
and
responds
as
strenuously
to
a
cheery
chirrup
as
to
the
lash
we
greet
and
pass
the
time
of
day
and
as
he
mounts
the
rise
he
calls
back
a
warning
of
coming
rain
i
am
already
white
with
dust
as
he
with
flour
sacramental
dust
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
stir
and
beat
of
the
heart
of
labouring
life
next
to
pass
down
the
road
is
an
anxious
ruffled
hen
her
speckled
breast
astir
with
maternal
troubles
she
walks
delicately
lifting
her
feet
high
and
glancing
furtively
from
side
to
side
with
comb
low
dressed
the
sight
of
man
the
heartless
from
whose
haunts
she
has
fled
wrings
from
her
a
startled
cluck
and
she
makes
for
the
white
gate
climbs
through
and
disappears
i
know
her
feelings
too
well
to
intrude
many
times
already
has
she
hidden
herself
amassed
four
or
five
precious
treasures
brooding
over
them
with
anxious
hope
and
then
after
a
brief
desertion
to
seek
the
necessary
food
she
has
returned
to
find
her
efforts
at
concealment
vain
her
treasures
gone
at
last
with
the
courage
of
despair
she
has
resolved
to
brave
the
terrors
of
the
unknown
and
seek
a
haunt
beyond
the
tyranny
of
man
i
will
watch
over
her
from
afar
and
when
her
is
fulfilled
i
will
marshal
her
and
her
brood
back
to
the
farm
where
she
belongs
for
what
end
i
care
not
to
think
it
is
of
the
mystery
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
things
and
we
are
all
god

beasts

once

what
a
wonderful
work
wagner
has
done
for
humanity
in
translating
the
toil
of
life
into
the
readable
script
of
music
for
those
who
seek

rhythmic

as
i

road
two
tramps
come
and
fling
themselves
by
me
as
i
eat
my
noonday
meal
the
one
furtive
lies
on
his
side
with
restless
clutching
hands
that
tear
and
twist
and
torture

living

while
his
lips
mutter
incoherently
the
other
sits
stooped
legs
wide
apart
his
face
grey
almost
as
grey
as
his
stubbly
beard
and
it
is
not
long
since
death
looked
him
in
the
eyes
he
tells
me
querulously
of
a
two
hundred
miles
tramp
since
early
spring
of
search
for
work
casual
jobs
with
more
kicks
than
halfpence
and
a
brief
but
blissful
sojourn
in
a
hospital
bed
from
which
he
was
dismissed
with
sentence
passed
upon
him
for
himself
he
is
determined
to
die
on

road
under

hedge
where
a

can

chapter
iii
yesterday
was
a
day
of
encounters
first
early
in
the
morning
a
young
girl
came
down
the
road
on
a
bicycle
her
dressguard
was
loose
and
she
stopped
to
ask
for
a
piece
of
string
when
i
had
tied
it
for
her
she
looked
at
me
at
my
worn
dusty
clothes
and
burnt
face
and
then
she
took
a
niphetos
rose
from
her
belt
and
laid
it
shyly
in
my
dirty
disfigured
palm
i
bared
my
head
and
stood
hat
in
hand
looking
after
her
as
she
rode
away
up
the
hill
then
i
took
my
treasure
and
put
it
in
a
nest
of
cool
dewy
grass
under
the
hedge
ancilla
my
next
visitor
was
a
on
his
way
to
a
job
at
the
he
stood
gazing
meditatively
at
my
heap
of
stones
ow
long
ave
yer
bin
at
this
job
that
y
ere
in
such
a
hurry
i
stayed
my
hammer
to
four
seen
better
days
never
i
said
emphatically
and
punctuated
the
remark
with
a
stone
split
neatly
in
four
the
man
surveyed
me
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
mean
ter
say
yer
like
crackin
these
blamed
stones
to
fill
oles
some
other
fool
s
made
i
nodded
well
that
beats
everything
now
i
seen
better
days
worked
in
a
big
brewery
over
near
town
that
and
something
doing
and
now
ere
i
am
ammering
me
eart
out
on
these
blasted
stones
for
a
bit
o
bread
and
a
pipe
o
baccy
once
a
ain
t
good
he
pulled
a
blackened
clay
from
his
pocket
and
began
slowly
filling
it
with
rank
tobacco
then
he
lit
it
carefully
behind
his
battered
hat
put
the
spent
match
back
in
his
pocket
rose
to
his
feet
hitched
his
braces
and
with
a
silent
nod
to
me
went
on
to
his
job
why
do
we
give
these
tired
children
whose
minds
move
slowly
whose
eyes
are
holden
that
they
can
not
read
the
book
whose
hearts
are
full
of
sore
resentment
against
they
know
not
what
such
work
as
this
to
their
hearts
out
for
a
bit
of
bread
all
the
pathos
of
unreasoning
labour
rings
in
these
few
words
we
fit
the
collar
on
unwilling
necks
and
when
their
service
is
over
we
bid
them
go
out
free
but
we
break
the
good
mosaic
law
and
send
them
away
empty
what
wonder
there
is
so
little
willing
service
so
few
ears
ready
to
be
thrust
through
against
the
master
s
door
the
swift
stride
of
civilisation
is
leaving
behind
individual
effort
and
turning
man
into
the
dÃ¦mon
of
a
machine
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
long
loom
lifting
a
lever
at
either
end
paces
he
who
once
with
painstaking
intelligence
drove
the
shuttle
he
tasted
the
joy
of
completed
work
that
which
his
eye
had
looked
upon
and
his
hands
had
handled
now
his
work
is
as
little
finished
as
the
web
of
penelope
once
the
reaper
grasped
the
golden
corn
stems
and
with
dexterous
sweep
of
sickle
set
free
the
treasure
of
the
earth
once
the
creatures
of
the
field
were
known
to
him
and
his
eye
caught
the
flare
of
scarlet
and
blue
as
the
frail
poppies
and
sturdy
laid
down
their
beauty
at
his
feet
now
he
sits
serene
on
juggernaut
s
car
its
guiding
dÃ¦mon
and
the
field
is
silent
to
him
as
with
the
web
and
the
grain
so
with
the
wood
and
stone
in
the
of
our
needs
the
ground
was
accursed
our
that
in
the
sweat
of
our
brow
we
might
eat
bread
now
the
many
live
in
the
of
the
few
and
it
must
be
so
for
as
little
as
great
king
cnut
could
stay
the
sea
until
it
had
reached
the
appointed
place
so
little
can
we
raise
a
barrier
to
the
wave
of
progress
and
say
thus
far
and
no
further
shalt
thou
what
then
this
at
least
if
we
live
in
an
age
of
mechanism
let
us
see
to
it
that
we
are
a
race
of
intelligent
mechanics
and
if
man
is
to
be
the
dÃ¦mon
of
a
machine
let
him
know
the
setting
of
the
knives
the
rise
of
the
piston
the
part
that
each
wheel
and
rod
plays
in
the
economy
of
the
whole
the
part
that
he
himself
plays
with
it
then
when
he
has
lived
and
served
intelligently
let
us
give
him
of
our
flocks
and
of
our
floor
that
he
may
learn
to
rest
in
the
lengthening
shadows
until
he
is
called
to
his
work
above
so
i
sat
hammering
out
my
thoughts
and
with
them
the
conviction
that
stonebreaking
should
be
allotted
to
minor
poets
or
vagrant
children
of
nature
like
myself
never
to
such
tired
folk
as
my
poor
mate
at
the
and
his
fellows
at
noon
when
i
stopped
for
my
meal
the
sun
was
baking
the
hard
white
road
in
a
pitiless
glare
several
waggons
and
carts
passed
the
horses
sweating
and
straining
with
drooping
ears
the
men
for
the
most
part
nodded
slumberously
on
the
shaft
seeking
the
little
shelter
the
cart
afforded
but
one
shuffled
in
the
white
dust
with
an
occasional
chirrup
and
friendly
pressure
on
the
tired
horse
s
neck
then
an
old
woman
and
a
small
child
appeared
in
sight
both
with
enormous
and
carrying
baskets
as
they
came
up
with
me
the
woman
stopped
and
swept
her
face
with
her
hand
while
the
child
depositing
the
basket
in
the
dust
with
great
care
wiped
her
little
sticky
fingers
on
her
pinafore
then
the
shady
hedge
beckoned
them
and
they
came
and
sat
down
near
me
the
woman
looked
about
seventy
tall
angular
dauntless
good
for
another
ten
years
of
hard
work
the
little
only
grandchild
she
told
just
four
her
father
away
soldiering
and
the
mother
died
in
childbed
so
for
four
years
the
child
had
known
no
other
guardian
or
playmate
than
the
old
woman
she
was
not
the
least
shy
but
had
the
strange
which
comes
from
associating
with
one
who
has
travelled
far
on
life
s
journey
i
couldn
t
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
said
her
grandmother
and
she
wouldn
t
leave
the
kitten
for
fear
it
should
be
lonesome
a
humorous
tender
glance
at
the
but
it
s
a
long
tramp
in
the
heat
for
the
little
one
and
we
ve
another
mile
to
will
you
let
her
bide
here
till
you
come
back
i
said
she
ll
be
all
right
by
the
old
lady
hesitated
will
ee
stay
by
him
dearie
she
said
the
small
child
nodded
drew
from
her
miniature
pocket
a
piece
of
sweetstuff
extracted
from
the
basket
a
small
black
cat
and
settled
in
for
the
afternoon
her
grandmother
rose
took
her
basket
and
with
a
nod
and
thank
ee
kindly
mister
went
off
down
the
road
i
went
back
to
my
work
a
little
had
i
not
white
hair
a
few
minutes
had
shown
me
that
i
was
not
old
enough
for
the
child
despite
my
forty
years
she
was
quite
happy
with
the
little
black
cat
which
lay
in
the
small
lap
blinking
its
yellow
eyes
at
the
sun
and
presently
an
old
man
came
by
lame
and
bent
with
gnarled
twisted
hands
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick
he
greeted
me
in
a
high
piping
voice
limped
across
to
the
child
and
sat
down
your
little
maid
mister
he
said
i
explained
ah
he
said
i
ve
left
a
little
darlin
like
this
at
ome
it
s
ard
on
us
old
folks
when
we
re
one
too
many
but
the
little
mouths
must
be
filled
and
my
son
e
said
e
didn
t
see
they
could
keep
me
on
the
with
another
child
on
the
way
so
i
m
tramping
to
to
the
house
but
it
s
a
ard
pinch
leavin
the
little
i
looked
at
typical
countryman
with
white
hair
mild
blue
eyes
and
a
rosy
childish
unwrinkled
face
i
m
he
went
on
and
terrible
bad
with
the
rheumatics
and
my
chest
maybe
it
ll
not
be
long
before
the
lord
remembers
the
child
crept
close
and
put
a
sticky
little
hand
confidingly
into
the
tired
old
palm
the
two
looked
strangely
alike
for
the
world
seems
much
the
same
to
those
who
leave
it
behind
as
to
those
who
have
but
taken
the
first
step
on
its
circular
pathway
ook
at
my
kitty
she
said
pointing
to
the
small
creature
in
her
lap
then
as
the
old
man
touched
it
with
trembling
fingers
she
went
oo
isn
t
my
grandad
he
s
away
in
the
sky
but
i
ll
kiss
i
worked
on
hearing
at
intervals
the
old
piping
voice
and
the
much
of
a
note
and
thinking
of
the
blessings
vouchsafed
to
the
simple
old
age
which
crowns
a
harmless
spent
in
the
fields
the
two
under
the
hedge
had
everything
in
common
and
were
boundlessly
content
together
the
sting
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
past
for
the
one
and
for
the
other
still
to
come
while
i
stood
on
the
battlefield
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
though
thank
god
with
my
face
to
the
foe
the
old
man
sat
resting
i
had
promised
him
a
lift
with
my
friend
the
driver
of
the
and
he
was
almost
due
when
the
child
s
grandmother
came
down
the
road
when
she
saw
my
other
visitor
she
stood
amazed
what
richard
hunton
that
worked
with
my
old
man
years
ago
up
at
ditton
whatever
are
you
doin
all
these
miles
from
your
own
place
is
it
eliza
jakes
he
looked
at
her
dazed
doubtful
an
who
else
should
it
be
where
s
your
memory
gone
richard
hunton
and
you
not
such
a
great
age
either
where
are
you
stayin
shame
overcame
him
his
lips
trembled
his
mild
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
told
the
tale
as
i
had
heard
it
and
mrs
jakes
s
indignation
was
good
to
see
not
keep
you
on
alf
a
crown
send
you
to
the
house
may
the
lord
forgive
them
you
wouldn
t
eat
no
more
than
a
cat
and
not
long
for
this
world
either
that
s
plain
to
see
no
richard
hunton
you
don
t
go
to
the
house
while
i
m
above
ground
it
d
make
my
good
man
turn
to
think
of
it
you
ll
come
ome
with
me
and
the
little
un
there
i
ve
my
washin
and
a
bit
put
by
for
a
rainy
day
and
a
bed
to
spare
and
the
lord
and
the
parson
will
see
i
don
t
come
to
she
stopped
breathless
her
defensive
motherhood
in
arms
the
old
man
said
quaveringly
in
the
pathetic
grudging
phrase
of
the
poor
which
veils
their
gratitude
while
it
testifies
their
independence
maybe
i
might
as
he
rose
with
difficulty
picked
up
his
bundle
and
stick
the
small
child
replaced
the
kitten
in
its
basket
and
thrust
her
hand
in
her
new
friend
s
then
oo
grandad
tum
back
she
said
mrs
jakes
had
been
fumbling
in
her
pocket
and
extracted
a
penny
which
she
pressed
on
me
it
s
little
enough
mister
she
said
then
as
i
tried
to
return
it
nay
i
ve
enough
and
yours
is
poor
paid
i
hope
i
shall
always
be
able
to
keep
that
penny
and
as
i
watched
the
three
going
down
the
dusty
white
road
with
the
child
in
the
middle
i
thanked
god
for
the
brotherhood
of
the
poor
chapter
iv
yesterday
a
funeral
passed
from
the
at
a
quaint
sepulture
without
solemnities
the
rough
ungarnished
coffin
of
stained
deal
lay
bare
and
unsightly
on
the
floor
of
an
old
a
woman
sat
beside
steadying
it
with
her
feet
the
husband
drove
and
the
most
depressed
of
the
three
was
the
horse
a
grey
it
was
pathetic
this
bringing
home
in
death
of
the
old
father
whom
while
he
lived
they
had
been
too
poor
to
house
it
was
at
no
small
sacrifice
that
they
had
spared
him
that
terror
of
old
age
a
pauper
s
grave
and
brought
him
to
lie
by
his
wife
in
our
quiet
churchyard
they
felt
no
emotion
this
husband
and
wife
only
a
dull
sense
of
filial
duty
done
respectability
preserved
and
above
and
through
all
the
bitter
but
necessary
counting
the
cost
of
this
last
bed
it
is
strange
how
pagan
many
of
us
are
in
our
beliefs
true
the
funeral
libations
have
made
way
for
the
comfortable
still
to
the
large
majority
death
is
pluto
king
of
the
dark
unknown
whence
no
traveller
returns
rather
than
azrael
brother
and
friend
lord
of
this
mansion
of
life
strange
how
men
shun
him
as
he
waits
in
the
shadow
watching
our
puny
straining
after
immortality
sending
his
comrade
sleep
to
prepare
us
for
himself
when
the
hour
strikes
he
gently
very
tenderly
if
we
will
but
have
it
the
tired
hands
together
takes
the
feet
in
his
broad
strong
palm
and
lifting
us
in
his
wonderful
arms
he
bears
us
swiftly
down
the
valley
and
across
the
waters
of
remembrance
very
pleasant
art
thou
o
brother
death
thy
love
is
wonderful
passing
the
love
of
women
i
have
lived
in
a
whirl
of
dust
is
the
great
annual
cattle
fair
at
and
through
the
long
hot
hours
the
beasts
from
all
the
district
round
have
streamed
in
broken
procession
along
my
road
to
change
hands
or
to
die
surely
the
lordship
over
creation
implies
wise
and
gentle
rule
for
intelligent
use
not
the
pursuit
of
a
mere
immediate
end
without
any
thought
of
community
in
the
great
sacrament
of
life
for
the
most
part
mystery
has
ceased
for
this
working
western
world
and
with
it

coventry
patmore
says

actually
and
literally
with
his
whole

herbs

up
and

beasts
assimilate

and
god
in
the

and
its
proper

who

st

are

s
it
is
man
in
his
blind
who
separates
woof
from
weft
in
the
living
garment
of
god
and
loses
the
more
as
he
neglects
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
a
grace
in
olden
days
the
herd
led
his
flock
going
first
in
the
post
of
danger
to
defend
the
creatures
he
had
weaned
from
their
natural
habits
for
his
various
uses
now
that
good
relationship
has
ceased
for
us
to
exist
man
drives
the
beasts
before
him
means
to
his
end
but
with
no
harmony
between
end
and
means
all
day
long
the
droves
of
sheep
pass
me
on
their
lame
and
patient
way
no
longer
freely
and
instinctively
following
a
protector
and
forerunner
but
impelled
by
force
and
resistless
same
will
which
once
went
before
without
force
they
are
all
trimmed
as
much
as
possible
to
one
pattern
and
all
make
the
same
sad
plaint
it
is
a
day
on
which
to
thank
god
for
the
unknown
tongue
the
drover
and
his
lad
in
dusty
blue
coats
plod
along
stolidly
deaf
and
blind
to
all
but
the
way
before
them
no
longer
wielding
the
crook
instrument
of
deliverance
or
at
most
of
gentle
compulsion
but
armed
with
a
heavy
stick
and
mechanically
dealing
blows
on
the
short
thick
fleeces
without
evil
intent
because
without
is
the
ritual
of
the
trade
of
all
the
poor
dumb
pilgrims
of
the
road
the
bullocks
are
the
most
terrible
to
see
they
are
not
patient
but
go
most
unwillingly
with
lowered
head
and
furtive
sideways
motion
in
their
eyes
a
horror
of
great
fear
the
sleek
cattle
knee
deep
in
pasture
massed
at
the
gate
and
stared
and
with
inquiring
bellow
at
the
retreating
drove
but
these
passed
without
answer
on
to
the
unknown
and
for
them
it
spelt
death
behind
a
squadron
of
sleek
formed
in
fours
with
straw
braid
in
mane
and
tail
came
the
ponies
for
the
most
part
a
merry
company
long
strings
of
rusty
shaggy
unbroken
unkempt
the
short
down
grass
still
sweet
on
their
tongues
full
of
fun
frolic
and
wickedness
biting
and
pulling
casting
longing
eyes
at
the
hedgerows
the
boys
appear
to
recognise
them
as
kindred
spirits
and
are
curiously
forbearing
and
patient
soon
both
ponies
and
boys
vanish
in
a
white
whirl
and
a
long
line
of
carts
which
had
evidently
waited
for
the
dust
to
subside
comes
slowly
up
the
incline
for
the
most
part
they
carry
the
pigs
and
fowls
carriage
folk
of
the
road
the
latter
are
hot
crowded
and
dusty
under
the
open
netting
the
former
for
the
most
part
cheerfully
remonstrative
i
drew
a
breath
of
relief
as
the
noise
of
wheels
died
away
and
my
road
sank
into
silence
the
hedgerows
are
no
longer
green
but
white
and
choked
with
dust
a
sight
to
move
good
sister
rain
to
welcome
tears
the
birds
seem
to
have
fled
before
the
noisy
confusion
i
wonder
whether
my
snake
has
seen
and
smiled
at
the
clumsy
ruling
of
the
lord
he
so
little
heeds
i
turned
aside
through
the
gate
to
plunge
face
and
hands
into
the
cool
of
the
sheltered
grass
that
side
the
hedge
and
then
rested
my
eyes
on
the
stretch
of
green
i
had
lacked
all
day
the
rabbits
had
apparently
played
and
browsed
unmindful
of
the
stir
and
were
still
flirting
their
white
tails
along
the
hedgerows
a
lark
rose
another
and
another
and
i
went
back
to
my
road
peace
still
reigned
for
the
shadows
were
lengthening
and
there
would
be
little
more
traffic
for
the
fair
i
turned
to
my
work
grateful
for
the
stillness
and
saw
on
the
white
stretch
of
road
a
lone
old
man
and
a
pig
surely
i
knew
that
tall
figure
in
the
quaint
grey
smock
surely
i
knew
the
face
furrowed
like
nature
s
face
in
springtime
and
crowned
by
a
round
soft
hat
and
the
pig
the
black
pig
walking
decorously
free
ay
i
knew
them
in
the
early
spring
i
took
a
whole
holiday
and
a
long
tramp
and
towards
afternoon
tired
and
thirsty
sought
water
at
a
little
lonely
cottage
whose
windows
peered
and
blinked
under
overhanging
brows
of
thatch
i
had
not
the
water
i
asked
for
but
milk
and
a
bowl
of
sweet
porridge
for
which
i
paid
only
thanks
and
stayed
for
a
chat
with
my
kindly
hosts
they
were
a
quaint
old
couple
of
the
kind
rarely
met
with
nowadays
they
enjoyed
a
little
pension
from
the
squire
and
a
garden
in
which
vegetables
and
flowers
lived
side
by
side
in
friendliest
fashion
bees
worked
and
sang
over
the
thyme
and
marjoram
blooming
early
in
a
sunny
nook
and
in
a
homely
sty
lived
a
solemn
black
pig
a
pig
with
a
history
it
was
no
common
utilitarian
pig
but
the
honoured
guest
of
the
old
couple
and
it
knew
it
a
year
before
their
youngest
and
only
surviving
child
then
a
man
of
had
brought
his
mother
the
result
of
his
savings
in
the
shape
of
a
fine
young
pig
a
week
later
he
lay
dead
of
the
typhoid
that
scourged
maidstone
hence
the
pig
was
sacred
cared
for
and
loved
by
this
darby
and
joan
ee
be
mos
like
a
child
to
me
and
the
mother
an
mos
as
sensible
as
a
christian
ee
be
the
old
man
had
said
and
i
could
hardly
credit
my
eyes
when
i
saw
the
tall
bent
figure
side
by
side
with
the
black
pig
coming
along
my
road
on
such
a
day
i
hailed
the
old
man
and
both
turned
aside
but
he
gazed
at
me
without
remembrance
i
spoke
of
the
pig
and
its
history
he
nodded
wearily
ay
ay
lad
you
ve
got
it
tis
poor
dick
s
pig
right
but
you
re
never
going
to
take
it
to
ay
but
i
be
and
comin
back
alone
if
the
lord
be
marciful
the
missus
has
been
terrible
bad
this
two
mouths
and
more
squire
s
in
foreign
parts
and
such
as
the
old
woman
wants
is
hard
buying
for
poor
folks
the
stocking
s
empty
now
tis
the
pig
must
go
and
i
believe
he
d
be
glad
for
to
do
the
missus
a
turn
she
were
terrible
good
to
him
were
the
missus
and
fond
too
i
dursn
t
tell
her
he
was
to
go
she
d
sooner
starve
than
lose
poor
dick
s
pig
well
we
d
best
be
movin
tis
a
fairish
the
pig
followed
comprehending
and
docile
and
as
the
quaint
couple
passed
from
sight
i
thought
i
heard
brother
death
stir
in
the
shadow
he
is
a
strong
angel
and
of
great
pity
chapter
v
there
is
always
a
little
fire
of
wood
on
the
open
hearth
in
the
kitchen
when
i
get
home
at
night
the
old
lady
says
it
is
company
for
her
and
sits
in
the
lonely
twilight
her
knotted
hands
lying
quiet
on
her
lap
her
listening
eyes
fixed
on
the
burning
sticks
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
she
hears
music
in
the
leap
and
lick
of
the
fiery
tongues
music
such
as
he
of
bayreuth
draws
from
the
violins
till
the
hot
energy
of
the
fire
spirit
is
on
us
embodied
in
sound
surely
she
hears
some
voice
that
lonely
old
woman
on
whom
is
set
the
seal
of
great
silence
it
is
a
great
truth
tenderly
said
that
god
builds
the
nest
for
the
blind
bird
and
may
it
not
be
that
he
opens
closed
eyes
and
unstops
deaf
ears
to
sights
and
sounds
from
which
others
by
these
very
senses
are
debarred
here
the
best
of
us
see
through
a
mist
of
tears
men
as
trees
walking
it
is
only
in
the
land
which
is
very
far
off
and
yet
very
near
that
we
shall
have
fulness
of
sight
and
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
and
i
can
not
think
that
any
listening
ears
listen
in
vain
the
coppice
at
our
back
is
full
of
birds
for
it
is
far
from
the
road
and
they
nest
there
undisturbed
year
after
year
through
the
still
night
i
heard
the
nightingales
calling
calling
until
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
went
softly
out
into
the
luminous
dark
the
little
wood
was
manifold
with
sound
i
heard
my
little
brothers
who
move
by
night
rustling
in
grass
and
tree
a
hedgehog
crossed
my
path
with
a
dull
squeak
the
bats
shrilled
high
to
the
stars
a
white
owl
swept
past
me
crying
his
hunting
note
a
beetle
boomed
suddenly
in
my
face
and
above
and
through
it
all
the
nightingales
sang
the
night
wind
bent
the
listening
trees
and
the
stars
yearned
earthward
to
hear
the
song
of
deathless
love
louder
and
louder
the
wonderful
notes
rose
and
fell
in
a
passion
of
melody
and
then
sank
to
rest
on
that
low
thrilling
call
which
it
is
said
death
once
heard
and
stayed
his
hand
they
will
scarcely
sing
again
this
year
these
nightingales
for
they
are
late
on
the
wing
as
it
is
it
seems
as
if
on
such
nights
they
sang
as
the
swan
sings
knowing
it
to
be
the
last
the
lavish
note
of
one
who
bids
an
eternal
farewell
at
last
there
was
silence
sitting
under
the
big
beech
tree
the
giant
of
the
coppice
i
rested
my
tired
self
in
the
lap
of
mother
earth
breathed
of
her
breath
and
listened
to
her
voice
in
the
quickening
silence
until
my
flesh
came
again
as
the
flesh
of
a
little
child
for
it
is
true
recreation
to
sit
at
the
footstool
of
god
wrapped
in
a
fold
of
his
living
robe
the
while
night
smoothes
our
tired
face
with
her
healing
hands
the
grey
dawn
awoke
and
stole
with
trailing
robes
across
earth
s
floor
at
her
footsteps
the
birds
roused
from
sleep
and
cried
a
greeting
the
sky
flushed
and
paled
conscious
of
coming
splendour
and
overhead
a
file
of
swans
passed
with
broad
strong
flight
to
the
reeded
waters
of
the
sequestered
pool
another
hour
of
silence
while
the
light
throbbed
and
flamed
in
the
east
then
the
larks
rose
harmonious
from
a
neighbouring
field
the
rabbits
scurried
with
ears
alert
to
their
morning
meal
the
day
had
begun
i
passed
through
the
coppice
and
out
into
the
fields
beyond
the
dew
lay
heavy
on
leaf
and
blade
and
gossamer
a
cool
fresh
wind
swept
clear
over
dale
and
down
from
the
sea
and
the
clover
field
rippled
like
a
silvery
lake
in
the
breeze
there
is
something
inexpressibly
beautiful
in
the
unused
day
something
beautiful
in
the
fact
that
it
is
still
untouched
unsoiled
and
town
and
country
share
alike
in
this
loveliness
at
three
on
a
june
morning
even
london
has
not
assumed
her
responsibilities
but
smiles
and
glows
lighthearted
and
smokeless
under
the
caresses
of
the
morning
sun
five
o
clock
the
bell
rings
out
crisp
and
clear
from
the
monastery
where
the
bedesmen
of
st
hugh
watch
and
pray
for
the
souls
on
this
labouring
forgetful
earth
every
hour
the
note
of
comfort
and
warning
cries
across
the
land
tells
the
sanctus
the
angelus
and
the
hours
of
the
passion
and
calls
to
remembrance
and
prayer
when
the
wind
is
north
the
sound
carries
as
far
as
my
road
and
companies
me
through
the
day
and
if
to
his
dumb
children
god
in
his
mercy
reckons
work
as
prayer
most
certainly
those
who
have
forged
through
the
ages
an
unbroken
chain
of
supplication
and
thanksgiving
will
be
counted
among
the
stalwart
labourers
of
the
house
of
the
lord
sun
and
bell
together
are
my
only
clock
it
is
time
for
my
water
drawing
and
gathering
a
pile
of
mushrooms
children
of
the
night
i
hasten
home
the
cottage
is
dear
to
me
in
its
quaint
untidiness
and
want
of
rectitude
dear
because
we
are
to
be
its
last
denizens
last
of
the
long
line
of
toilers
who
have
sweated
and
sown
that
others
might
reap
and
have
passed
away
leaving
no
trace
i
once
saw
a
tall
cross
in
a
seaboard
churchyard
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
the
unknown
dead
who
have
perished
in
these
there
might
be
one
in
every
village
to
the
unhonoured
many
who
made
fruitful
the
land
with
sweat
and
tears
it
is
a
consolation
to
think
that
when
we
look
back
on
this
stretch
of
life
s
road
from
beyond
the
first
milestone
which
it
is
instructive
to
remember
is
always
a
grave
we
may
hope
to
see
the
work
of
this
world
with
open
eyes
and
to
judge
of
it
with
a
due
sense
of
proportion
a
bee
with
laden
hummed
and
buzzed
in
the
hedge
as
i
got
ready
for
work
importuning
the
flowers
for
that
which
he
could
not
carry
and
finally
giving
up
the
attempt
in
despair
fell
asleep
on
a
buttercup
the
best
place
for
his
weary
little
velvet
body
in
five
may
have
been
five
hours
to
awoke
a
new
bee
sensible
and
and
flew
blithely
away
to
the
hive
with
his
example
this
weary
world
would
be
wise
to
follow
my
road
has
been
lonely
a
parson
came
by
in
the
afternoon
a
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
for
he
asked
his
way
he
talked
awhile
and
with
kindly
rebuke
said
it
was
sad
to
see
a
man
of
my
education
brought
so
low
which
shows
how
the
outside
appearance
may
mislead
the
prejudiced
observer
was
it
misfortune
nay
the
best
of
good
luck
i
answered
gaily
the
good
man
with
beautiful
readiness
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
stones
and
bade
me
say
on
read
me
a
sermon
in
stone
he
said
simply
and
i
stayed
my
hand
to
read
he
listened
with
courteous
intelligence
you
hold
a
roadmender
has
a
vocation
he
asked
as
the
monk
or
the
artist
for
like
both
he
is
universal
the
world
is
his
home
he
serves
all
men
alike
ay
and
for
him
the
beasts
have
equal
honour
with
the
men
his
soul
is
bound
up
in
the
bundle
of
life
with
all
other
souls
he
sees
his
father
his
mother
his
brethren
in
the
children
of
the
road
for
him
there
is
nothing
unclean
nothing
common
the
very
stones
cry
out
that
they
parson
nodded
his
head
it
is
all
true
he
said
beautifully
true
but
need
such
a
view
of
life
necessitate
the
work
of
roadmending
surely
all
men
should
be
o
wise
parson
so
to
read
the
lesson
of
the
road
it
is
true
i
answered
but
some
of
us
find
our
salvation
in
the
actual
work
and
earn
our
bread
better
in
this
than
in
any
other
way
no
man
is
dependent
on
our
earning
all
men
on
our
work
we
are
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
because
we
have
all
that
we
need
and
yet
we
taste
the
life
and
poverty
of
the
very
poor
we
are
if
you
will
uncloistered
monks
preaching
friars
who
speak
not
with
the
tongue
disciples
who
hear
the
wise
words
of
a
silent
robert
louis
stevenson
was
a
roadmender
said
the
wise
parson
ay
and
with
more
than
his
pen
i
answered
i
wonder
was
he
ever
so
truly
great
so
entirely
the
man
we
know
and
love
as
when
he
inspired
the
chiefs
to
make
a
highway
in
the
wilderness
surely
no
more
fitting
monument
could
exist
to
his
memory
than
the
road
of
gratitude
cut
laid
and
kept
by
the
tribe
kings
of
parson
nodded
he
knew
that
the
people
who
make
no
roads
are
ruled
out
from
intelligent
participation
in
the
world
s
he
filled
his
pipe
thinking
the
while
then
he
held
out
his
pouch
to
me
try
some
of
this
baccy
he
said
sherwood
of
magdalen
sent
it
me
from
some
outlandish
i
accepted
gratefully
it
was
such
tobacco
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
roadmenders
he
rose
to
go
i
wish
i
could
come
and
break
stones
he
said
a
little
wistfully
nay
said
i
few
men
have
such
weary
roadmending
as
yours
and
perhaps
you
need
my
road
less
than
most
men
and
less
than
most
we
shook
hands
and
he
went
down
the
road
and
out
of
my
life
he
little
guessed
that
i
knew
sherwood
ay
and
knew
him
too
for
had
not
sherwood
told
me
of
the
man
he
delighted
to
honour
ah
well
i
am
no
browning
junior
and
sherwood
s
name
is
not
sherwood
chapter
vi
awhile
ago
i
took
a
holiday
mouched
played
truant
from
my
road
jem
the
waggoner
hailed
me
as
he
was
going
to
the
i
ride
with
him
and
come
back
atop
of
the
full
sacks
i
hid
my
hammer
in
the
hedge
climbed
into
the
great
waggon
white
and
fragrant
with
the
clean
sweet
meal
and
flung
myself
down
on
the
empty
flour
bags
the
tarpaulin
framed
the
long
vista
of
my
road
with
the
downs
beyond
and
i
lay
in
the
cool
dark
caressed
by
the
fresh
breeze
in
its
thoroughfare
soothed
by
the
strong
monotonous
tramp
of
the
great
grey
team
and
the
music
of
the
jangling
harness
jem
walked
at
the
leaders
heads
it
is
his
rule
when
the
waggon
is
empty
a
rule
no
company
will
make
him
break
at
first
i
regretted
it
but
soon
discovered
i
learnt
to
know
him
better
so
as
he
plodded
along
his
thickset
figure
slightly
bent
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
whip
under
one
arm
whistling
hymn
tunes
in
a
low
minor
while
the
great
horses
answered
to
his
voice
without
touch
of
lash
or
guiding
rein
i
lay
as
in
a
blissful
dream
and
watched
my
road
unfold
the
sun
set
the
aflare
where
the
hedge
is
sparse
and
stretched
the
long
shadows
of
the
besom
poplars
in
slanting
bars
across
the
white
highway
the
roadside
gardens
smiled
friendly
with
their
laurels
and
rows
of
stately
seemly
proximity
this
daphne
and
clytie
sisters
in
experience
wrapped
in
the
warm
caress
of
the
god
whose
wooing
they
need
no
longer
fear
here
and
there
we
passed
little
groups
of
women
and
children
off
to
work
in
the
early
cornfields
and
jem
paused
in
his
fond
repetition
of
the
lord
my
pasture
shall
prepare
to
give
them
it
is
like
life
this
travelling
which
has
been
alone
life
which
is
after
all
retrospective
with
a
steady
moving
on
into
the
unknown
unseen
until
faith
is
lost
in
sight
and
experience
is
no
longer
the
touchstone
of
humanity
the
face
of
the
son
of
adam
is
set
on
the
road
his
brothers
have
travelled
marking
their
landmarks
tracing
their
journeyings
but
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
of
god
he
looks
forward
straining
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
jewelled
walls
of
his
future
home
the
city
eternal
in
the
presently
we
left
my
road
for
the
deep
shade
of
a
narrow
country
way
where
the
great
oaks
and
beeches
meet
overhead
and
no
sets
his
hand
to
stay
nature
s
profusion
and
so
by
pleasant
lanes
scarce
the
waggon
s
width
across
now
shady
now
sunny
here
bordered
by
thickset
coverts
there
giving
on
fruitful
fields
we
came
at
length
to
the
mill
i
left
jem
to
his
business
with
the
miller
and
wandered
down
the
flowery
meadow
to
listen
to
the
merry
clack
of
the
stream
and
the
voice
of
the
waters
on
the
weir
the
great
wheel
was
at
rest
as
i
love
best
to
see
it
in
the
later
afternoon
the
splash
and
churn
of
the
water
belong
rather
to
the
morning
hours
it
is
the
chief
mistake
we
make
in
portioning
out
our
day
that
we
banish
rest
to
the
which
is
for
sleep
and
recreating
instead
of
setting
apart
the
later
afternoon
and
quiet
twilight
hours
for
the
stretching
of
weary
limbs
and
repose
of
tired
mind
after
a
day
s
toil
that
should
begin
and
end
at
five
the
little
stone
bridge
over
the
is
almost
on
a
level
with
the
clear
running
water
and
i
lay
there
and
gazed
at
the
huge
wheel
which
under
multitudinous
forms
and
uses
is
one
of
the
world
s
wonders
because
one
of
the
few
things
we
imitative
children
have
not
learnt
from
nature
is
it
perchance
a
memory
out
of
that
past
when
adam
walked
in
paradise
and
talked
with
the
lord
in
the
cool
of
the
day
did
he
see
then
the
flaming
wheels
instinct
with
service
wondrous
messengers
of
the
most
high
vouchsafed
in
vision
to
the
later
prophets
maybe
he
did
and
going
forth
from
before
the
avenging
sword
of
his
own
forging
to
the
bitterness
of
an
accursed
earth
took
with
him
this
bright
memory
of
perfect
ceaseless
service
and
so
fashioned
our
labouring
link
with
the
time
of
his
innocency
it
is
one
of
many
unanswered
questions
good
to
ask
because
it
has
no
answer
only
the
suggestion
of
a
train
of
thought
perhaps
we
are
never
so
receptive
as
when
with
folded
hands
we
say
simply
this
is
a
great
i
watched
and
wondered
until
jem
called
and
i
had
to
leave
the
rippling
weir
and
the
water
s
side
and
the
wheel
with
its
untold
secret
the
miller
s
wife
gave
me
tea
and
a
crust
of
bread
and
the
miller
s
little
maid
sat
on
my
knee
while
i
told
the
sad
tale
of
a
little
pink
cloud
separated
from
its
parents
and
teazed
and
hunted
by
mischievous
little
airs
if
i
mistake
not
her
garden
will
be
wet
with
its
tears
and
let
us
hope
point
a
moral
for
the
tale
had
its
origin
in
a
frenzied
chicken
driven
from
the
side
of
an
anxious
mother
and
pursued
by
a
sturdy
relentless
figure
in
a
white
the
little
maid
trotted
off
greatly
sobered
to
look
somewhat
prematurely
for
the
cloud
s
tears
and
i
climbed
to
my
place
at
the
top
of
the
sacks
and
thence
watched
twilight
pass
to
starlight
through
my
narrow
peep
and
so
watching
slept
until
jem
s
voice
hailed
me
from
dreamland
and
i
went
only
half
awake
across
the
dark
fields
home
autumn
is
here
and
it
is
already
late
he
has
painted
the
hedges
russet
and
gold
scarlet
and
black
and
a
tangle
of
grey
now
he
has
damp
brown
leaves
in
his
hair
and
frost
in
his
it
is
a
season
of
contrasts
at
first
all
is
stir
and
bustle
the
ingathering
of
man
and
beast
barn
and
rickyard
stand
filled
with
golden
treasure
at
the
farm
the
sound
of
threshing
in
wood
and
copse
the
squirrels
busied
twixt
tree
and
storehouse
while
the
ripe
nuts
fall
with
thud
of
thunder
rain
when
the
harvesting
is
over
the
fruit
gathered
the
last
rick
thatched
there
comes
a
pause
earth
strips
off
her
bright
colours
and
shows
a
bare
and
furrowed
face
the
dead
leaves
fall
gently
and
sadly
through
the
calm
sweet
air
grey
mists
drape
the
fields
and
hedges
the
migratory
birds
have
left
save
a
few
late
swallows
and
as
i
sit
at
work
in
the
soft
still
rain
i
can
hear
the
blackbird
s
melancholy
trill
and
the
thin
pipe
of
the
redbreast
s
winter
air
is
full
of
the
sound
of
farewell
forethought
and
preparation
for
the
future
which
shall
be
farewell
because
of
the
future
which
may
never
us
man
thou
hast
goods
laid
up
for
many
years
and
it
is
well
but
remember
this
night
soul
may
be
required
is
the
unvoiced
lesson
of
autumn
there
is
growing
up
among
us
a
great
fear
it
stares
at
us
white
from
the
faces
of
men
and
women
fear
of
pain
mental
and
bodily
pain
for
the
last
twenty
years
we
have
waged
war
with
noble
war
when
fought
in
the
interest
of
the
many
but
fraught
with
great
danger
to
each
individual
man
it
is
the
fear
which
should
not
be
rather
than
the
hope
which
is
in
us
that
leads
men
in
these
days
to
drape
death
in
a
flowery
mantle
to
lay
stress
on
the
shortness
of
parting
the
speedy
reunion
to
postpone
their
until
the
last
moment
or
avoid
saying
them
altogether
and
this
fear
is
a
poor
ignoble
thing
unworthy
of
those
who
are
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
we
are
still
paying
the
price
of
that
knowledge
suffering
in
both
kinds
is
a
substantial
part
of
it
and
brings
its
own
healing
let
us
pay
like
men
our
face
to
the
open
heaven
neither
whimpering
like
children
in
the
dark
nor
lulled
to
unnecessary
oblivion
by
some
lethal
drug
for
it
is
manly
not
morbid
to
dare
to
taste
the
pungent
savour
of
pain
the
lingering
sadness
of
farewell
which
emphasises
the
aftermath
of
life
it
should
have
its
place
in
all
our
preparation
as
a
part
of
our
inheritance
we
dare
not
be
without
there
is
an
old
couple
in
our
village
who
are
past
work
the
married
daughter
has
made
shift
to
take
her
mother
and
the
parish
but
there
is
neither
room
nor
food
for
the
father
and
he
must
go
to
if
husband
and
wife
went
together
they
would
be
separated
at
the
workhouse
door
the
parting
had
to
come
it
came
yesterday
i
saw
them
stumbling
lamely
down
the
road
on
their
last
journey
together
walking
side
by
side
without
touch
or
speech
seeing
and
heeding
nothing
but
a
blank
future
as
they
passed
me
the
old
man
said
gruffly
tis
far
eno
better
be
gettin
back
but
the
woman
shook
her
head
and
they
breasted
the
hill
together
at
the
top
they
paused
shook
hands
and
separated
one
went
on
the
other
turned
back
and
as
the
old
woman
limped
blindly
by
i
turned
away
for
there
are
sights
a
man
dare
not
look
upon
she
passed
and
i
heard
a
child
s
shrill
voice
say
i
come
to
look
for
you
gran
and
i
thanked
god
that
there
need
be
no
utter
loneliness
in
the
world
while
it
holds
a
little
child
now
it
is
my
turn
and
i
must
leave
the
wayside
to
serve
in
the
sheepfolds
during
the
winter
months
it
is
scarcely
a
farewell
for
my
road
is
ubiquitous
eternal
there
are
green
ways
in
paradise
and
golden
streets
in
the
beautiful
city
of
god
nevertheless
my
heart
is
heavy
for
viewed
by
the
light
of
the
waning
year
roadmending
seems
a
great
and
wonderful
work
which
i
have
poorly
conceived
of
and
meanly
performed
yet
i
have
learnt
to
understand
dimly
the
truths
of
three
great
blessing
of
a
curse
the
voice
of
silence
the
companionship
of
so
take
my
leave
of
this
stretch
of
road
and
of
you
who
have
fared
along
the
white
highway
through
the
medium
of
a
printed
page
farewell
it
is
a
roadmender
s
word
i
cry
you
godspeed
to
the
next
beyond
out
of
the
shadow
chapter
i
i
am
no
longer
a
roadmender
the
stretch
of
white
highway
which
leads
to
the
end
of
the
world
will
know
me
no
more
the
fields
and
hedgerows
grass
and
leaf
stiff
with
the
crisp
rime
of
winter
s
breath
lie
beyond
my
horizon
the
ewes
in
the
folding
their
mysterious
eyes
quick
with
the
consciousness
of
coming
motherhood
answer
another
s
voice
and
hand
while
i
lie
here
not
in
the
lonely
companionship
of
my
expectations
but
where
the
shadow
is
bright
with
kindly
faces
and
gentle
hands
until
one
kinder
and
gentler
still
carries
me
down
the
stairway
into
the
larger
room
but
now
the
veil
was
held
aside
and
one
went
by
crowned
with
the
majesty
of
years
wearing
the
ermine
of
an
unstained
rule
the
purple
of
her
people
s
loyalty
nations
stood
with
bated
breath
to
see
her
pass
in
the
starlit
mist
of
her
children
s
tears
a
of
her
time
an
men
called
mother
a
cried
queen
still
the
crowned
captive
of
her
people
s
prisoner
of
love
the
passed
under
my
window
in
silence
neither
song
nor
shout
broke
the
welcome
dark
next
morning
the
workmen
who
went
by
were
strangely
quiet
victoria
dei
gratia
britanniarum
did
they
think
of
how
that
legend
would
disappear
and
of
all
it
meant
as
they
paid
their
pennies
at
the
the
feet
rarely
know
the
true
value
and
work
of
the
head
but
all
englishmen
have
been
and
will
be
quick
to
acknowledge
and
revere
victoria
by
the
grace
of
god
a
wise
woman
a
great
and
loving
mother
years
ago
i
standing
at
a
level
crossing
saw
her
pass
the
train
slowed
down
and
she
caught
sight
of
the
gatekeeper
s
little
girl
who
had
climbed
the
barrier
such
a
smile
as
she
gave
her
and
then
i
caught
a
quick
startled
gesture
as
she
slipped
from
my
vision
i
thought
afterwards
it
was
that
she
feared
the
child
might
fall
mother
first
then
queen
even
so
rest
came
to
in
one
of
the
royal
palaces
but
in
her
own
home
surrounded
by
the
immediate
circle
of
her
nearest
and
dearest
while
the
world
kept
watch
and
ward
i
a
shy
lover
of
the
fields
and
woods
longed
always
should
a
painless
passing
be
vouchsafed
me
to
make
my
bed
on
the
fragrant
pine
needles
in
the
aloneness
of
a
great
forest
to
lie
once
again
as
i
had
lain
many
a
time
bathed
in
the
bitter
sweetness
of
the
pines
lapped
in
the
manifold
silence
my
ear
attuned
to
the
wind
of
heaven
with
its
call
from
the
cities
of
peace
in
sterner
mood
when
love
s
hand
held
a
scourge
i
craved
rather
the
stress
of
the
moorland
with
its
bleaker
mind
imperative
of
sacrifice
to
rest
again
under
the
lee
of
rippon
tor
swept
by
the
strong
breeze
to
stare
untired
at
the
long
reaches
and
watch
the
huddle
and
shrink
round
the
stones
of
blood
until
my
sacrifice
too
was
accomplished
and
my
soul
had
fled
a
wild
waste
moor
a
vast
void
sky
and
naught
between
heaven
and
earth
but
man
his
eyes
seeking
afar
the
distant
light
of
his
own
heart
with
years
came
counsels
more
profound
and
the
knowledge
that
man
was
no
mere
dweller
in
the
woods
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
the
piping
god
but
an
integral
part
of
an
organised
whole
in
which
pan
too
has
his
fulfilment
the
wise
venetians
knew
and
read
pantheism
into
christianity
when
they
set
these
words
round
ezekiel
s
living
creatures
in
the
altar
vault
of
st
mark
s
quaeque
sub

thou
shalt
have
none
other
gods
but
if
man
had
been
able
to
keep
this
one
commandment
perfectly
the
other
nine
would
never
have
been
written
instead
he
has
comprehensively
disregarded
it
and
perhaps
never
more
than
now
in
the
twentieth
century
ah
well
this
world
in
spite
of
all
its
sinning
is
still
the
garden
of
eden
where
the
lord
walked
with
man
not
in
the
cool
of
evening
but
in
the
heat
and
stress
of
the
immediate
working
day
there
is
no
angel
now
with
flaming
sword
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
but
tapers
alight
morning
by
morning
in
the
hostel
of
god
to
point
us
to
it
and
we
who
are
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
partake
of
that
fruit
whereof
whoso
eateth
shall
never
die
the
greatest
gift
or
the
most
awful
life
i
then
with
my
craving
for
tree
and
sky
held
that
a
great
capital
with
its
stir
of
life
and
death
of
toil
and
strife
and
pleasure
was
an
ill
place
for
a
sick
man
to
wait
in
a
place
to
shrink
from
as
a
child
shrinks
from
the
rude
blow
of
one
out
of
authority
yet
here
far
from
moor
and
forest
hillside
and
hedgerow
in
the
family
of
the
peoples
the
london
much
misunderstood
i
find
the
fulfilment
by
antithesis
of
all
desire
for
the
loneliness
of
the
moorland
there
is
the
warmth
and
companionship
of
london
s
swift
beating
heart
for
silence
there
is
sound
and
stir
of
the
most
part
far
in
excess
of
its
earthly
equivalent
against
the
fragrant
incense
of
the
pines
i
set
the
honest
sweat
of
the
man
whose
lifetime
is
the
measure
of
his
working
day
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
how
shall
he
love
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
wrote
blessed
john
who
himself
loved
so
much
that
he
beheld
the
lamb
as
it
had
been
slain
from
the
beginning
when
adam
fell
and
the
city
of
god
with
light
most
precious
the
burden
of
corporate
sin
the
sword
of
corporate
sorrow
the
joy
of
corporate
righteousness
thus
we
become
citizens
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
companions
of
all
his
creatures
it
is
not
good
that
the
man
should
be
alone
said
the
lord
god
i
live
now
as
it
were
in
two
worlds
the
world
of
sight
and
the
world
of
sound
and
they
scarcely
ever
touch
each
other
i
hear
the
grind
of
heavy
traffic
the
struggle
of
horses
on
the
ground
the
decorous
jolt
of
omnibuses
the
jangle
of
cab
bells
the
sharp
warning
of
bicycles
at
the
corner
the
swift
rattle
of
costers
carts
as
they
go
south
at
night
with
their
shouting
goading
crew
all
these
things
i
hear
and
more
but
i
see
no
road
only
the
silent
river
of
my
heart
with
its
tale
of
wonder
and
years
and
the
white
beat
of
seagulls
wings
in
strong
inquiring
flight
sometimes
there
is
naught
to
see
on
the
waterway
but
a
solitary
black
hull
a
very
stygian
manned
by
a
solitary
figure
and
moving
slowly
up
under
the
impulse
of
the
sweeps
then
the
great
barges
pass
with
their
coffined
treasure
drawn
by
a
small
later
lightened
of
their
load
and
waiting
on
wind
and
tide
i
see
them
swooping
by
like
birds
set
free
tawny
sails
that
mind
me
of
whitby
with
its
northern
fleet
black
sails
as
of
some
heedless
theseus
white
sails
that
sweep
out
of
the
morning
mist
like
restless
they
make
the
bridge
which
is
just
within
my
vision
and
then
away
past
westminster
and
blackfriars
where
st
paul
s
great
dome
lifts
the
cross
high
over
a
city
past
southwark
where
england
s
poet
illuminates
in
the
scroll
of
divine
wisdom
the
sign
of
the
tabard
past
the
tower
with
its
haunting
ghosts
of
history
past
greenwich
fairy
city
caught
in
the
meshes
of
riverside
mist
and
then
the
salt
and
speer
of
the
sea
the
companying
with
great
ships
the
fresh
burden
at
night
i
see
them
again
silent
mysterious
searching
the
darkness
with
unwinking
yellow
stare
led
by
a
great
green
light
they
creep
up
under
the
bridge
which
spans
the
river
with
its
watching
eyes
and
vanish
crying
back
a
warning
note
as
they
make
the
upper
reach
or
strident
hail
as
a
chain
of
kindred
phantoms
passes
ploughing
a
contrary
tide
throughout
the
long
watches
of
the
night
i
follow
them
and
in
the
early
morning
they
slide
by
their
eyes
pale
in
the
twilight
while
the
stars
flicker
and
fade
and
the
gas
lamps
die
down
into
a
dull
yellow
blotch
against
the
glory
and
glow
of
a
new
day

february
is
here
february
the
month
of
purification
of
cleansing
rains
and
pulsing
bounding
streams
and
white
mist
clinging
insistent
to
field
and
hedgerow
so
that
when
her
veil
is
withdrawn
greenness
may
make
us
glad
the
river
has
been
uniformly
grey
of
late
with
no
wind
to
ruffle
its
surface
or
to
speed
the
barges
dropping
slowly
and
sullenly
down
with
the
tide
through
a
blurring
haze
i
watched
one
yesterday
its
useless
sails
and
no
sign
of
life
save
the
man
at
the
helm
it
drifted
stealthily
past
and
a
little
behind
flying
low
came
a
solitary
seagull
grey
as
the
river
s
following
bird
once
again
i
lay
on
my
back
in
the

of

tarry
old
fishing
smack
blue
sky
above
and
no
sound
but
the
knock
knock
of
the
waves
and
the
thud
and
curl
of
falling
foam
as
the
old
boat
s
blunt
nose
breasted
the
coming
sea
then
daddy
whiddon
spoke
a
follerin
bÃ¼rrd
he
said
i
got
up
and
looked
across
the
blue
field
we
were
ploughing
into
white
furrows
far
away
a
tiny
sail
scarred
the
great
solitude
and
astern
came
a
gull
flying
slowly
close
to
the
water
s
breast
daddy
whiddon
waved
his
pipe
towards
it
a
follerin
bÃ¼rrd
he
said
again
and
again
i
waited
questions
were
not
grateful
to
him
there

a

there
sure
enough
a

driftin

the

of

with
the
the
clumsy
boom
swung
across
as
we
changed
our
course
and
the
water
ran
from
us
in
smooth
reaches
on
either
side
the
bird
flew
steadily
on
what
will
the
spirit
do
i
said
the
old
man
looked
at

gravely
her

now
her

on
with
the
the

was
flying
close
to

now
and
a

swept
the
sunny

i
shivered
daddy
looked
at
me
curiously
there
be
reason
enough
to
be
cawld
if
us
did
but
knaw
it
but
i
he
mos
used
to
em
poor
he
shaded
his
keen
old
blue
eyes
and
looked
away
across
the
water
his
face
kindled
there
be
a
skule
comin
and
by
my
sawl
tis
mackerel
they
be
drivin
i
watched
eagerly
and
saw
the
dark
line
rise
and
fall
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
away
behind
the
stir
and
rush
of
tumbling
porpoises
as
they
chased
their
prey
again
we
changed
our
tack
and
each
taking
an
oar
pulled
lustily
for
the
beach
please
god
her
ll
break
inshore
said
daddy
whiddon
and
he
shouted
the
news
to
the
idle
waiting
men
who
hailed
us
in
a
moment
all
was
stir
for
the
fishing
had
been
slack
two
boats
put
out
with
the
lithe
brown
seine
the
dark
line
had
turned
but
the
school
was
still
behind
churning
the
water
in
clumsy
haste
they
were
coming
in
then
the
brit
broke
in
silvery
leaping
waves
on
the
shelving
beach
the
threefold
hunt
was
over
the
porpoises
turned
out
to
sea
in
search
of
fresh
quarry
and
the
seine
dragged
by
ready
hands
came
slowly
stubbornly
in
with
its
quivering
treasure
of
fish
they
had
sought
a
haven
and
found
none
the
brit
lay
dying
in
flickering
iridescent
heaps
as
the
babies
of
the
village
gathered
them
up
and
far
away
over
the
water
i
saw
a
single
grey
speck
it
was
the
following
bird
the
curtain
of
river
haze
falls
back
barge
and
bird
are
alike
gone
and
the
lamplighter
has
lit
the
first
on
the
far
side
of
the
bridge
every
night
i
watch
him
come
his
progress
marked
by
the
great
yellow
eyes
that
wake
the
dark
sometimes
he
walks
quickly
sometimes
he
loiters
on
the
bridge
to
chat
or
stare
at
the
dark
water
but
he
always
comes
leaving
his
watchful
deterrent
train
behind
him
to
police
the
night
once
demeter
in
the
black
anguish
of
her
desolation
searched
for
lost
persephone
by
the
light
of
hecate
s
torch
and
searching
all
in
vain
spurned
beneath
her
empty
feet
an
earth
barren
of
her
smile
froze
with
set
brows
the
merry
brooks
and
streams
and
smote
forest
and
plain
and
fruitful
field
with
the
breath
of
her
last
despair
until
even
iambe
s
laughing
jest
was
still
and
then
when
the
desolation
was
complete
across
the
wasted
valley
where
the
starveling
cattle
scarcely
longed
to
browse
came
the
dreadful
persephone
the
day
of
the
prisoner
of
hades
had
dawned
and
as
the
sun
flamed
slowly
up
to
light
her
thwarted
eyes
the
world
sprang
into
blossom
at
her
feet
we
can
never
be
too
pagan
when
we
are
truly
christian
and
the
old
myths
are
eternal
truths
held
fast
in
the

prometheus

outside
my

a

little
black
skeleton

sparrows
congregate
to
chirp

bicker
farther

i

a

graceful

children
of

their

still
more

gleam
ghostly
in
the

athwart

they
make
a
brave
show
even
in

with
their
feathery

whereas
my

stands
stark
and
uncompromising
with
its
horde
of
sooty
sparrows
cockney
to
the

a
pathetic
inability
to
look
anything
but
black
rain
comes
with
strong

and
the

no

then
their
glistening
blackness
mirrors
back
the
succeeding

as
a

sometimes

was
to
eight
saved
souls
out
of
a
waste
of
perpetual
sign
of
the
remembering

of

last
night
there
was
a
sudden
clatter
of
hoofs
a
shout
and
then
silence
a
runaway
a
dark
night
a
wide
crossing
and
a
heavy
burden
so
death
came
to
a
poor
woman
people
from
the
house
went
out
to
help
and
i
heard
of
her
the
centre
of
an
unknowing
curious
crowd
as
she
lay
bonnetless
in
the
mud
of
the
road
her
head
on
the
kerb
a
rude
but
painless
death
the
misery
lay
in
her
life
for
this
and
but
fifty
years
to
set
against
such
a
condition
the
policeman
reported
her
respectable
living
apart
from
her
husband
with
a
sister
but
although
they
shared
rooms
they
did
not
speak
and
the
sister
refused
all
responsibility
so
the
parish
buried
the
dead
woman
and
thus
ended
an
uneventful
tragedy
was
it
her
own
fault
if
so
the
greater
pathos
the
lonely
souls
that
hold
out
timid
hands
to
an
unheeding
world
have
their
meed
of
interior
comfort
even
here
while
the
sons
of
consolation
wait
on
the
for
their
footfall
but
god
help
the
soul
that
bars
its
own
door
it
is
kicking
against
the
pricks
of
divine
ordinance
the
ordinance
of
a
triune
god
whether
it
be
the
dweller
in
crowded
street
or
tenement
who
is
proud
to
say
i
keep
myself
to
myself
or
seneca
writing
in
pitiful
complacency
whenever
i
have
gone
among
men
i
have
returned
home
less
of
a
whatever
the
next
world
holds
in
store
we
are
bidden
in
this
to
seek
and
serve
god
in
our
and
in
the
creatures
of
his
making
whom
he
calls
by
name
it
was
once
my
privilege
to
know
an
old
named
gawdine
he
was
a
hard
swearer
a
hard
drinker
a
hard
liver
and
he
fortified
himself
body
and
soul
against
the
world
he
even
drank
alone
which
is
an
evil
sign
one
day
to
gawdine
sober
came
a
little
dirty
child
who
clung
to
his
empty
trouser
had
lost
a
limb
years
a
persistent
unintelligible
request
he
shook
the
little
chap
off
with
a
blow
and
a
curse
and
the
child
was
trotting
dismally
away
when
it
suddenly
turned
ran
back
and
held
up
a
dirty
face
for
a
kiss
two
days
later
gawdine
fell
under
a
passing
dray
which
inflicted
terrible
internal
injuries
on
him
they
patched
him
up
in
hospital
and
he
went
back
to
his
taking
with
him
two
pain
which
fell
suddenly
upon
him
to
rack
and
rend
with
an
anguish
of
crucifixion
and
the
memory
of
a
child
s
upturned
face
outwardly
he
was
the
same
save
that
he
changed
the
tunes
of
his
organ
out
of
savings
for
the
jigs
and
reels
which
children
hold
dear
and
stood
patiently
playing
them
in
alleys
where
pennies
are
not
as
plentiful
as
elsewhere
he
continued
to
drink
it
did
not
come
within
his
new
code
to
stop
since
he
could
carry
his
liquor
well
but
he
rarely
if
ever
swore
he
told
me
this
tale
through
the
throes
of
his
anguish
as
he
lay
crouched
on
a
mattress
on
the
floor
and
as
the
grip
of
the
pain
took
him
he
tore
and
bit
at
his
hands
until
they
were
maimed
and
bleeding
to
keep
the
ready
curses
off
his
lips
he
told
the
story
but
he
gave
no
reason
offered
no
explanation
he
has
been
dead
now
many
a
year
and
thus
would
i
write
his
epitaph
he
saw
the
face
of
a
little
child
and
looked
on
god
chapter
iii
two
began
in
a
low
voice
why
the
fact
is
you
see
miss
this
here
ought
to
have
been
a
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
as
i
look
round
this
room
i
feel
sure
two
and
five
and
seven
have
all
been
at
work
on
it
and
made
no
mistakes
for
round
the
walls
runs
a
frieze
of
squat
standard
red
as
red
can
be
and
just
like
those
that
alice
saw
in
the
queen
s
garden
in
between
them
are
chaucer
s
prim
little
daisies
peering
wideawake
from
green
grass
this
same
grass
has
a
history
which
i
have
heard
in
the
original
stencil
for
the
frieze
it
was
purely
conventional
like
the
rest
and
met
in
spikey
curves
round
each
tree
the
painter
however
who
was
doing
the
work
was
a
lover
of
the
fields
and
feeling
that
such
grass
was
a
travesty
he
added
on
his
own
account
dainty
little
tussocks
and
softened
the
hard
line
into
a
tufted
carpet
the
grass
growing
irregularly
bent
at
will
by
the
wind
the
result
from
the
standpoint
of
conventional
art
is
indeed
disastrous
but
my
sympathy
and
gratitude
are
with
the
painter
i
see
as
he
saw
the
robe
of
living
ineffable
green
of
whose
brilliance
the
eye
never
has
too
much
and
in
whose
weft
no
two
threads
are
alike
and
shrink
as
he
did
from
the
conventionalising
of
that
windswept
glory
the
sea
has
its
crested
waves
of
recognisable
form
the
river
its
eddy
and
swirl
and
separate
vortices
but
the
grass
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
the
grass
bows
as
the
wind
thou
canst
not
tell
whither
it
it
takes
no
pattern
it
obeys
no
recognised
law
it
is
like
a
beautiful
creature
of
a
thousand
wayward
moods
and
its
voice
is
like
nothing
else
in
the
wide
world
it
bids
you
rest
and
bury
your
tired
face
in
the
green
coolness
and
breathe
of
its
breath
and
of
the
breath
of
the
good
earth
from
which
man
was
taken
and
to
which
he
will
one
day
return
then
if
you
lend
your
ear
and
are
silent
minded
you
may
hear
wondrous
things
of
the
deep
places
of
the
earth
of
life
in
mineral
and
stone
as
well
as
in
pulsing
sap
of
a
green
world
as
the
stars
saw
it
before
man
trod
it
under
the
emerald
which
has
its
place
with
the
rest
in
the
city
of
god
what
if
earth
be
but
the
shadow
of
heaven
and
things
therein
each
to
each
other
like
more
than
on
earth
to
thought
it
is
a
natural
part
of
civilisation
s
lust
of
that
we
should
be
so
ready
to
conventionalise
the
beauty
of
this
world
into
decorative
patterns
for
our
pilgrim
tents
it
is
a
phase
and
will
melt
into
other
phases
but
it
tends
to
the
increase
of
artificiality
and
exists
not
only
in
art
but
in
everything
it
is
no
new
thing
for
jaded
sentiment
to
crave
the
spur
of
the
unnatural
to
prefer
the
clever
imitation
to
live
in
a
devachan
where
the
surroundings
appear
that
which
we
would
have
them
to
be
but
it
is
an
interesting
record
of
the
pulse
of
the
present
day
that
an
englishwoman
s
love
letters
should
have
taken
society
by
storm
in
the
way
it
certainly
has
it
is
a
delightful
book
to
leave
about
with
its
vellum
binding
dainty
ribbons
and
the
hallmark
of
a
great
publisher
s
name
but
when
we
seek
within
we
find
love
with
its
thousand
voices
and
wayward
moods
its
shy
graces
and
seemly
reticences
love
which
has
its
throne
and
robe
of
state
as
well
as
the
garment
of
the
beggar
maid
love
which
is
before
time
was
which
knew
the
world
when
the
stars
took
up
their
courses
presented
to
us
in
gushing
outpourings
the
appropriate
language
of
a
woman
s
heart
to
the
boor
she
delights
to
honour
it
is
woman
who
is
the
glory
of
man
says
the
author
of
the
house
of
wisdom
and
love
greater
because
so
far
the
less
and
man
is
her
head
but
only
as
he
serves
his
set
this
sober
aphorism
against
the
school
girl
which
kisses
a
man
s
feet
and
gaily
refuses
him
the
barren
honour
of
having
loved
her
first
there
is
scant
need
for
the
apologia
which
precedes
the
letters
a
few
pages
dispels
the
fear
that
we
are
prying
into
another
s
soul
as
for
the
authorship
there
is
a
woman
s
influence
an
artist
s
poorly
concealed
bias
in
the
foreign
letters
and
for
the
rest
a
man
s
much
easier
to
see
in
another
than
to
avoid
large
from

to
cover
king
cophetua
who
sends
profoundly
grateful
remembrances

most
surely
written
the

he
would
wish
to
receive

meynell
cries
one

triumphantly
nay
the

be
good
to
us
what
has
mrs
meynell
in
common
with
the
englishwoman

or
most
unconvincing
passion
men
can
write
as
from
a
woman
s
heart
when
they
are
minded
to
do
so
in
desperate
is
clarissa
harlowe
and
stevenson
s
kirstie
and
many
more
to
prove
it
but
when
a
man
writes
as
the
author
of
the
love
letters
writes
i
feel
as
did
the
painter
of
the
frieze
that
has
gone
too
far
and
included
that
which
like
the
grass
should
be
spared
such
a
convention
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
the
duchess
and
the
moral
of
that
be
what
you
would
seem
to
be
if
you
d
like
to
put
it
more
never
imagine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
and
so
by
way
of
the
queen
s
garden
i
come
back
to
my
room
again
my
heart
s
affections
are
still
centred
on
my
old
attic
with
boarded
floor
and
walls
where
the
sun
blazoned
a
frieze
of
red
and
gold
until
he
travelled
too
far
towards
the
north
the
moon
streamed
in
to
paint
the
trees
in
inky
wavering
shadows
and
the
stars
flashed
their
glory
to
me
across
the
years
but
now
sun
and
moon
greet
me
only
indirectly
and
under
the
red
roses
hang
pictures
some
of
them
the
dear
companions
of
my
days
opposite
me
is
the
arundel
print
of
the
presentation
painted
by
the
gentle
brother
of
the
priest
simeon
a
stately
figure
in
green
and
gold
great

never

nurse
our

we
find
in

in

manger
even
as
the
wise
men
found
him
when
they
came
from
the
east
to
seek
a
great
king
there
is
but
one
necessary
condition
of
this
finding
we
must
follow
the
particular
manifestation
of
light
given
us
never

until
it
the

there
is

i
think
the
old
bishop
must
have
understood
it
he
is
my
friend
of
friends
as
he
lies
opposite
my
window
in
his
alabaster
sleep
clad
in
pontifical
robes
with
unshod
feet
a
little
island
of
white
peace
in
a
marble
sea
the
faithful
sculptor
has
given
every
line
and
wrinkle
the
heavy
eyelids
and
sunken
face
of
tired
old
age
but
withal
the
smile
of
a
contented
child
i
do
not
even
know
my
bishop
s
name
only
that
the
work
is
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
he
is
good
to
company
with
through
the
day
for
he
has
known
darkness
and
light
and
the
minds
of
many
men
most
surely
too
he
has
known
that
god
fulfils
himself
in
strange
ways
so
with
the
shadow
of
his
feet
upon
the
polished
floor
he
rests
in
peace
chapter
iv
on
sunday
my
little
tree
was
limned
in
white
and
the
sparrows
were
craving
shelter
at
my
window
from
the
blizzard
now
the
mild
thin
air
brings
a
breath
of
spring
in
its
wake
and
the
daffodils
in
the
garden
wait
the
kisses
of
the
sun
with
memory
i
slip
away
down
the
years
and
remember
a
day
when
i
awoke
at
earliest
dawn
for
across
my
sleep
i
had
heard
the
lusty
trumpeters
heralding
the
spring
the
air
was
a
delicate
rime
frosted
roof
and
road
the
sea
lay
hazy
and
still
like
a
great
pearl
then
as
the
sky
stirred
with
flush
upon
flush
of
warm
rosy
light
it
passed
from
misty
pearl
to
opal
with
heart
of
flame
from
opal
to
gleaming
sapphire
the
earth
called
the
fields
called
the
river
pied
piper
to
whose
music
a
man
can
not
stop
his
ears
it
was
with
me
as
with
the
canterbury
pilgrims
so
priketh
hem
nature
in
hir
corages
than
longen
folk
to
gon
on
half
an
hour
later
i
was
away
by
the
early
train
that
carries
the
branch
mails
and
a
few
workmen
and
was
delivered
at
the
little
wayside
station
with
the
letters
the
kind
air
went
singing
past
as
i
swung
along
the
reverberating
road
between
the
high
banks
which
we
call
hedges
in
merry
devon
with
all
the
world
to
myself
and
the
brethren
a
great
blackbird
flew
out
with
a
loud
chook
chook
and
the
red
of
the
haw
on
his
yellow
bill
a
robin
trilled
from
a
low
two
wrens
searched
diligently
on
a
fallen
tree
for
breakfast
quite
unconcerned
when
i
rested
a
moment
beside
them
and
a
shrewmouse
slipped
across
the
road
followed
directly
by
its
mate
march
violets
bloomed
under
the
sheltered
hedge
with
here
and
there
a
pale
primrose
a
frosted
bramble
spray
still
held
its
autumn
tints
clinging
to
the
semblance
of
the
past
and
great
branches
of
snowy
blackthorn
broke
the
barren
hedgeway
as
if
spring
made
a
mock
of
winter
s
snows
light
of
heart
and
foot
with
the
new
wine
of
the
year
i
sped
on
again
stray
daffodils
lighting
the
wayside
until
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
stream
and
reached
the
field
gate
which
leads
to
the
lower
meadows
there
before
me
lay
spring
s
pageant
green
pennons
waving
dainty
maids
curtseying
and
a
host
of
joyous
yellow
trumpeters
proclaiming
victory
to
an
awakened
earth
they
range
in
serried
ranks
right
down
to
the
river
so
that
a
man
must
walk
warily
to
reach
the
water
s
edge
where
they
stand
gazing
down
at
themselves
in
fairest
semblance
like
their
most
tragic
progenitor
and
rising
from
the
bright
grass
in
their
thousands
stretch
away
until
they
melt
in
a
golden
cloud
at
the
far
end
of
the
misty
mead
through
the
field
gate
and
across
the
road
i
see
them
starring
the
steep
earth
bank
that
leads
to
the
upper
copse
gleaming
like
pale
flames
against
the
dark
there
they
have
but
frail
tenure
here
in
the
meadows
they
reign
supreme
at
the
upper
end
of
the
field
the
river
provides
yet
closer
sanctuary
for
these
children
of
the
spring
held
in
its
embracing
arms
lies
an
island
long
and
narrow
some
thirty
feet
by
twelve
a
veritable
untrod
eldorado
glorious
in
gold
from
end
to
end
a
fringe
of
reeds
by
the
water
s
edge
and
save
for
a
great
oak
stands
at
the
meadow
s
neck
an
oak
with
gnarled
and
wandering
roots
where
a
man
may
rest
for
it
is
bare
of
daffodils
save
for
a
group
of
three
and
a
solitary
one
apart
growing
close
to
the
old
tree
s
side
i
sat
down
by
my
lonely
little
sister
blue
sky
overhead
green
grass
at
my
feet
decked
like
the
pastures
of
the
blessÃ¨d
in
glorious
sheen
a
sea
of
triumphant
golden
heads
tossing
blithely
back
as
the
wind
swept
down
to
play
with
them
at
his
pleasure
it
was
all
mine
to
have
and
to
hold
without
severing
a
single
slender
stem
or
harbouring
a
thought
of
covetousness
mine
as
the
whole
earth
was
mine
to
appropriate
to
myself
without
the
burden
and
bane
of
worldly
possession
thou
sayest
that
i
king
said
the
lord
before
pilate
and
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
we
who
are
made
kings
after
his
likeness
possess
all
things
not
after
this
world
s
fashion
but
in
proportion
to
our
poverty
and
when
we
cease
to
toil
and
spin
are
arrayed
as
the
lilies
in
a
glory
transcending
solomon
s
bride
who
climbed
the
cross
with
out
eager
hands
to
free
us
from
our
chains
but
we
flee
from
her
and
lay
up
treasure
against
her
importunity
while
amytas
on
his
seaweed
bed
weeps
tears
of
pure
pity
for
cÃ¦sar
of
great
possessions
presently
another
of
spring
s
lovers
cried
across
the
water
cuckoo
cuckoo
and
the
voice
of
the
stream
sang
joyously
in
unison
it
is
free
from
burden
this
merry
little
river
and
neither
weir
nor
mill
bars
its
quick
way
to
the
sea
as
it
completes
the
eternal
circle
lavishing
gifts
of
coolness
and
refreshment
on
the
children
of
the
meadows
it
has
its
birth
on
the
great
lone
moor
cradled
in
a
wonderful
bog
with
a
coverlet
of
soft
gold
orange
emerald
tawny
olive
and
white
with
the
red
stain
of
and
tufted
under
the
old
grey
rocks
which
watch
it
rise
tormantil
stars
the
turf
and
bids
godspeed
to
the
little
child
of
earth
and
sky
thus
the
journey
begins
and
with
strength
the
stream
carves
a
way
through
the
dear
brown
peat
wears
a
fresh
wrinkle
on
the
patient
stones
and
patters
merrily
under
a
clapper
bridge
which
spanned
its
breadth
when
the
mistletoe
reigned
and
bottor
the
grim
rock
idol
exacted
the
toll
of
human
life
that
made
him
great
on
and
on
goes
the
stream
for
it
may
not
stay
leaving
of
its
freshness
with
the
great
osmunda
that
stretches
eager
roots
towards
the
running
water
flowing
awhile
with
a
brother
stream
to
part
again
east
and
west
as
each
takes
up
his
separate
burden
of
friend
to
cherish
the
lower
meadows
in
their
flowery
so
by
the
great
back
to
sky
and
earth
again
the
river
of
god
is
full
of
water
the
streets
of
the
city
are
pure
gold
verily
here
also
having
nothing
we
possess
all
things
the
air
was
keen
and
still
as
i
walked
back
in
the
early
evening
and
a
daffodil
light
was
in
the
sky
as
if
heaven
mirrored
back
earth
s
radiance
near
the
station
some
children
flitted
past
like
little
white
miller
moths
homing
through
the
dusk
as
i
climbed
the
hill
the
moon
rode
high
in
a
golden
was
daffodils
to
the
last
chapter
v
the
seagulls
from
the
upper
reaches
pass
down
the
river
in
sober
steady
flight
seeking
the
open
sea
i
shall
miss
the
swoop
and
circle
of
silver
wings
in
the
sunlight
and
the
plaintive
call
which
sounds
so
strangely
away
from
rock
and
shore
but
it
is
good
to
know
that
they
have
gone
from
mudbank
and
murky
town
back
to
the
free
airs
of
their
inheritance
to
the
shadow
of
cliffs
and
the
curling
crest
of
the
waves
to
brood
again
over
the
great
ocean
of
a
world
s
tears
my
little
tree
is
gemmed
with
buds
shy
immature
but
full
of
promise
the
sparrows
busied
with
in
the
neighbouring
pipes
and
gutters
use
it
for
a
vantage
ground
and
crowd
there
in
numbers
each
little
beak
sealed
with
long
golden
straw
or
downy
feather
the
river
is
heavy
with
hay
barges
the
last
fruits
of
winter
s
storehouse
the
lengthening
days
slowly
and
steadily
oust
the
dark
the
air
is
loud
with
a
growing
clamour
of
life
spring
is
not
only
proclaimed
but
on
this
feast
she
is
crowned
and
despite
the
warring
wind
the
days
bring
their
meed
of
sunshine
we
stand
for
a
moment
at
the
meeting
of
the
ways
the
handclasp
of
winter
and
spring
of
sleep
and
wakening
of
life
and
death
and
there
is
between
them
not
even
the
thin
line
which
rabbi
jochanan
on
his
beheld
as
all
that
divided
hell
from
heaven
cujus
centrum
was
said
of
mercury
that
messenger
of
the
gods
who
marshalled
reluctant
spirits
to
the
underworld
and
for
mercury
we
may
write
life
with
death
as
its
great
sacrament
of
brotherhood
and
release
to
be
dreaded
only
as
we
dread
to
partake
unworthily
of
great
benefits
like
all
sacraments
it
has
its
rightful
time
and
due
solemnities
the
horror
and
sin
of
suicide
lie
in
the
presumption
of
free
will
the
forestalling
of
a
gift
sin
of
eve
in
paradise
who
took
that
which
might
only
be
given
at
the
hand
of
the
lord
it
has
too
its
physical
pains
but
they
are
those
of
a
woman
in
travail
and
we
remember
them
no
more
for
joy
that
a
is
born
into
the
world
naked
and
not
ashamed
beholding
ourselves
as
we
are
we
shall
see
also
the
leaves
of
the
tree
of
life
set
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
we
are
slowly
very
slowly
abandoning
our
belief
in
sudden
and
violent
transitions
for
a
surer
and
fuller
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
but
most
of
us
still
draw
a
sharp
line
of
demarcation
between
this
world
and
the
next
and
expect
a
radical
change
in
ourselves
and
our
surroundings
a
break
in
the
chain
of
continuity
entirely
contrary
to
the
teaching
of
nature
and
experience
in
the
same
way
we
cling
to
the
specious
untruth
that
we
can
begin
over
and
over
again
in
this
world
forgetting
that
while
our
sorrow
and
repentance
bring
sacramental
gifts
of
grace
and
strength
god
himself
can
not
by
his
own
limitation
rewrite
the
past
we
are
in
our
sorrow
that
which
we
have
made
ourselves
in
our
sin
our
temptations
are
there
as
well
as
the
way
of
escape
we
are
in
the
image
of
god
we
create
our
world
our
undying
selves
our
heaven
or
our
hell
creavit

it
is
stupendous
magnificent
and
most
appalling
a
man
does
not
change
as
he
crosses
the
threshold
of
the
larger
room
his
personality
remains
the
same
although
the
expression
of
it
may
be
altered
here
we
have
material
bodies
in
a
material
perhaps
ether
bodies
in
an
ether
world
there
is
no
indecency
in
reasonable
speculation
and
curiosity
about
the
life
to
come
one
end
of
the
thread
is
between
our
fingers
but
we
are
haunted
for
the
most
part
by
the
snap
of
atropos
shears
socrates
faced
death
with
the
magnificent
calm
bred
of
dignified
familiarity
he
had
built
for
himself
a
desired
heaven
of
colour
light
and
precious
philosophic
formula
of
those
who
set
the
spiritual
above
the
material
and
worship
truth
in
the
beauty
of
holiness
he
is
not
troubled
by
doubts
or
regrets
for
the
path
of
the
just
lies
plain
before
his
face
he
forbids
mourning
and
lamentations
as
out
of
place
obeys
minutely
and
cheerily
the
directions
of
his
executioner
and
passes
with
unaffected
dignity
to
the
apprehension
of
that
larger
truth
for
which
he
had
constantly
prepared
himself
his
friends
may
bury
him
provided
they
will
remember
they
are
not
burying
socrates
and
that
all
things
may
be
done
decently
and
in
order
a
cock
must
go
to
Ã¦sculapius
long
before
in
the
days
of
the
captivity
there
lived
in
godless
nineveh
an
exiled
jew
whose
father
had
fallen
from
the
faith
he
was
a
simple
man
and
direct
living
the
careful
kindly
life
of
an
orthodox
jew
suffering
many
persecutions
for
conscience
sake
and
in
constant
danger
of
death
he
narrates
the
story
of
his
life
and
of
the
blindness
which
fell
on
him
with
gentle
placidity
and
checks
the
exuberance
of
his
more
emotional
wife
with
the
assurance
of
untroubled
faith
finally
when
his
pious
expectations
are
fulfilled
his
sight
restored
and
his
son
prosperously
established
beside
him
he
breaks
into
a
prayer
of
rejoicing
which
reveals
the
secret
of
his
confident
content
he
made
use
of
two
great
faculties
the
sense
of
proportion
which
enabled
him
to
apprise
life
and
its
accidents
justly
and
the
gift
of
which
led
socrates
after
him
and
blessed
john
in
lonely
exile
on
patmos
to
look
through
the
things
temporal
to
the
hidden
meanings
of
eternity
let
my
soul
bless
god
the
great
king
he
cries
and
looks
away
past
the
present
distress
past
the
restoration
which
was
to
end
in
fresh
scattering
and
confusion
past
the
dream
of
gold
and
porphyry
and
marble
defaced
by
the
eagles
and
emblems
of
the
conqueror
until
his
eyes
are
held
by
the
jerusalem
of
god
built
up
with
sapphires
and
emeralds
and
precious
stones
with
battlements
of
pure
gold
and
the
cry
of
alleluia
in
her
streets
many
years
later
when
he
was
very
aged
he
called
his
son
to
him
and
gave
him
as
heritage
his
own
simple
rule
of
life
adding
but
one
request
keep
thou
the
law
and
the
commandments
and
shew
thyself
merciful
and
just
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
consider
what
alms
doeth
and
how
righteousness
doth
deliver
and
bury
me
decently
and
thy
mother
with
having
so
said
he
went
his
way
quietly
and
contentedly
to
the
jerusalem
of
his
heart
it
is
the
simple
note
of
familiarity
that
is
wanting
in
us
that
by
which
we
link
world
with
world
once
years
ago
i
sat
by
the
bedside
of
a
dying
man
in
a
wretched
garret
in
the
east
end
he
was
entirely
ignorant
entirely
quiescent
and
entirely
uninterested
the
minister
of
a
neighbouring
chapel
came
to
see
him
and
spoke
to
him
at
some
length
of
the
need
for
repentance
and
the
joys
of
heaven
after
he
had
gone
my
friend
lay
staring
restlessly
at
the
mass
of
decrepit
broken
chimney
pots
which
made
his
horizon
at
last
he
spoke
and
there
was
a
new
note
in
his
voice

said
as
ow
there
were
golding
streets
in
them

the

stretched
a
sudden
finger
and
painted
the
chimney
pots
red
and
gold
against
the

and
with
his
face
alight
with
surprised
relief
my
friend
died
we
are

socrates

with

the
itch

not

the

for

in

the
vision

er
the
souls
passed
straight
forward
under
the
throne
of
necessity
and
out
into
the
plains

forgetfulness
where
they

severally

have
it
so
and
when
night
comes
i
pass
into
the
kingdom
and
power
of
the
dark
i
lie
through
the
long
hours
and
watch
my
bridge
which
is
set
with
lights
across
the
gloom
watch
the
traffic
which
is
for
me
but
so
many
passing
lamps
telling
their
tale
by
varying
height
and
brightness
i
hear
under
my
window
the
sprint
of
horses
the
rattle
of
uncertain
wheels
as
the
hasten
south
the
jangle
of
cab
bells
as
the
take
their
homeward
way
the
gruff
altercation
of
weary
men
the
unmelodious
song
and
clamorous
laugh
of
women
whose
merriment
is
wearier
still
then
comes
a
time
of
stillness
when
the
light
in
the
sky
waxes
and
wanes
when
the
obscure
the
stars
and
i
gaze
out
into
blackness
set
with
watching
eyes
no
sound
comes
from
without
but
the
voice
of
the
and
the
cry
of
the
hour
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticks
imperatively
for
a
check
has
fallen
on
the
familiarity
which
breeds
a
disregard
of
common
things
and
a
reason
has
to
be
sought
for
each
sound
which
claims
a
hearing
the
pause
is
wonderful
while
it
lasts
but
it
is
not
for

the
working

remembrance
cries
an
end
to
forgetting
sometimes
in
the
country
on
a
night
in
early
summer
you
may
shut
the
cottage
door
to
step
out
into
an
immense
darkness
which
palls
heaven
and
earth
going
forward
into
the
embrace
of
the
great
gloom
you
are
as
a
babe
swaddled
by
the
hands
of
night
into
helpless
quiescence
your
feet
tread
an
unseen
path
your
hands
grasp
at
a
void
or
shrink
from
the
contact
they
can
not
realise
your
eyes
are
holden
your
voice
would
die
in
your
throat
did
you
seek
to
rend
the
veil
of
that
impenetrable
silence
shut
in
by
the
intangible
dark
we
are
brought
up
against
those
worlds
within
worlds
blotted
out
by
our
concrete
daily
life
the
working
of
the
great
microcosm
at
which
we
peer
dimly
through
the
little
window
of
science
the
wonderful
breathing
earth
the
pulsing
throbbing
sap
the
growing
fragrance
shut
in
the
calyx
of
s
flower
the
of
a
sleeping
world
that
we
dream
that
we
know
and
around
above
and
interpenetrating
all
the
world
of
dreams
of
angels
and
of
spirits
it
was
this
world
which
jacob
saw
on
the
first
night
of
his
exile
and
again
when
he
wrestled
in
peniel
until
the
break
of
day
it
was
this
world
which
elisha
saw
with
open
eyes
which
job
knew
when
darkness
fell
on
him
which
ezekiel
gazed
into
from
his
place
among
the
captives
which
daniel
beheld
as
he
stood
alone
by
the
great
river
the
river
hiddekel
for
the
moment
we
have
left
behind
the
realm
of
question
and
explanation
of
power
over
matter
and
the
exercise
of
bodily
faculties
and
passed
into
darkness
alight
with
visions
we
can
not
see
into
silence
alive
with
voices
we
can
not
hear
like
helpless
men
we
set
our
all
on
the
one
thing
left
us
and
lift
up
our
hearts
knowing
that
we
are
but
a
mere
speck
among
a
myriad
worlds
yet
greater
than
the
sum
of
them
having
our
roots
in
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
but
our
branches
in
the
sweet
airs
of
heaven
it
is
the
material
counterpart
of
the
night
of
the
we
have
left
our
house
and
set
forth
in
the
darkness
which
paralyses
those
faculties
that
make
us
men
in
the
world
of
men
but
surely
the
great
mystics
with
all
their
insight
and
heavenly
love
fell
short
when
they
sought
freedom
in
complete
separateness
from
creation
instead
of
in
perfect
unity
with
it
the
greeks
knew
better
when
they
flung
ariadne
s
crown
among
the
stars
and
wrote
demeter
s
grief
on
a
barren
earth
and
persephone
s
joy
in
the
fruitful
field
for
the
earth
is
gathered
up
in
man
he
is
the
whole
which
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
standing
in
the
image
of
god
and
clothed
in
the
garment
of
god
he
lifts
up
priestly
hands
and
presents
the
sacrifice
of
redeemed
earth
before
the
throne
of
the
dust
and
ashes
and
a
house
of
devils
he
cries
and
there
comes
back
for
answer
concupiscet
decorem
the
angel
of
death
has
broad
wings
of
silence
and
mystery
with
which
he
shadows
the
valley
where
we
need
fear
no
evil
and
where
the
voice
which
speaks
to
us
is
as
the
voice
of
doves
tabering
upon
their
it
is
a
place
of
healing
and
preparation
of
peace
and
refreshing
after
the
outlines
of
a
garish
day
walking
there
we
learn
to
use
those
natural
faculties
of
the
soul
which
are
hampered
by
the
familiarity
of
bodily
progress
to
apprehend
the
truths
which
we
have
intellectually
accepted
it
is
the
place
of
secrets
where
the
humility
which
embraces
all
attainable
knowledge
cries
i
know
not
and
while
we
proclaim
from
the
that
which
we
have
learnt
the
manner
of
our
learning
lies
hid
for
each
one
of
us
in
the
sanctuary
of
our
souls
the
egyptians
in
their
ancient
wisdom
act
in
the
desert
a
great
androsphinx
image
of
mystery
and
silence
staring
from
under
level
brows
across
the
arid
sands
of
the
the
greeks
borrowed
and
debased
the
image
turning
the
inscrutable
into
a
who
asked
a
foolish
riddle
and
hurled
herself
down
in
petulant
pride
when
Ådipus
answered
aright
so
we
marring
the
office
of
silence
question
its
mystery
thwart
ourselves
with
riddles
of
our
own
suggesting
and
turn
away
leaving
our
offering
but
half
consumed
on
the
altar
of
the
unknown
god
it
was
not
the
theft
of
fire
that
brought
the
vengeance
of
heaven
upon
prometheus
but
the
mocking
sacrifice
orpheus
lost
eurydice
because
he
must
see
her
face
before
the
appointed
time
persephone
ate
of
the
pomegranate
and
hungered
in
gloom
for
the
day
of
light
which
should
have
been
endless
the
universe
is
full
of
miracle
and
mystery
the
darkness
and
silence
are
set
for
a
sign
we
dare
not
despise
the
pall
of
night
lifts
leaving
us
engulphed
in
the
light
of
immensity
under
a
tossing
heaven
of
stars
the
dawn
breaks
but
it
does
not
surprise
us
for
we
have
watched
from
the
valley
and
seen
the
pale
twilight
through
the
wondrous
sabbath
of
faithful
souls
the
long
day
of
rosemary
and
rue
the
light
brightens
in
the
east
and
we
pass
on
towards
it
with
quiet
feet
and
opening
eyes
bearing
with
us
all
of
the
redeemed
earth
that
we
have
made
our
own
until
we
are
fulfilled
in
the
sunrise
of
the
great
easter
day

i
a
great
joy
has
come
to
me
one
of
those
unexpected
gifts
which
life
loves
to
bestow
after
we
have
learnt
to
loose
our
grip
of
her
i
am
back
in
my
own
place
very
near
my
white
gate
lies
within
my
distant
vision
near
the
lean
grey
downs
which
keep
watch
and
ward
between
the
country
and
the
sea
very
near
nay
in
the
lap
of
mother
earth
for
as
i
write
i
am
lying
on
a
green
carpet
powdered
yellow
and
white
with
the
sun
s
own
flowers
overhead
a
great
sycamore
where
the
bees
toil
and
sing
and
sighing
shimmering
poplars
golden
grey
against
the
blue
the
day
of
persephone
has
dawned
for
me
and
i
set
free
like
demeter
s
child
gladden
my
eyes
with
this
foretaste
of
coming
radiance
and
rest
my
tired
sense
with
the
scent
and
sound
of
home
away
down
the
meadow
i
hear
the
early
scythe
song
and
the
warm
air
is
fragrant
with
the
fallen
grass
it
has
its
own
message
for
me
as
i
lie
here
i
who
have
obtained
yet
one
more
mercy
and
the
burden
of
it
is
life
not
death
i
remember
when
taking
a
grace
from
my
road
i
helped
to
mow
farmer
marler
s
field
rich
in
ripe
upstanding
grass
the
mechanism
of
the
ancient
reaper
had
given
way
under
the
strain
of
the
home
meadows
and
if
this
crop
was
to
be
saved
it
must
be
by
hand
i
have
kept
the
record
of
those
days
of
joyous
labour
under
a
june
sky
men
were
hard
to
get
in
our
village
old
dodden
who
was
over
seventy
volunteered
his
had
done
yeoman
work
with
the
scythe
in
his
two
of
the
farm
hands
with
their
master
completed
our
strength
we
took
our
places
under
a
five
o
clock
morning
sky
and
the
larks
cried
down
to
us
as
we
stood
in
the
fragrant
grass
each
man
with
his
gleaming
scythe
poised
ready
for
its
sweeping
swing
old
dodden
led
by
right
of
age
and
ripe
experience
bent
like
a
sickle
brown
and
dry
as
a
nut
his
face
a
tracery
of
innumerable
wrinkles
he
has
never
ailed
a
day
and
the
cunning
of
his
craft
was
still
with
him
at
first
we
worked
stiffly
unreadily
but
soon
the
monotonous
motion
possessed
us
with
its
insistent
rhythm
and
the
grass
bowed
to
each
sibilant
swish
and
fell
in
swathes
at
our
feet
now
and
then
a
startled
rabbit
scurried
through
the
miniature
forest
to
vanish
with
white
flick
of
tail
in
the
tangled
hedge
here
and
there
a
mother
lark
was
discovered
sitting
motionless
immovable
upon
her
little
brood
but
save
for
these
infrequent
incidents
we
paced
steadily
on
with
no
speech
save
the
cry
of
the
hone
on
the
steel
and
the
swish
of
the
falling
swathes
the
sun
rose
high
in
the
heaven
and
burnt
on
bent
neck
and
bare
and
aching
arms
the
blood
beat
and
drummed
in
my
veins
with
the
unwonted
posture
and
exercise
i
worked
as
a
man
who
sees
and
hears
in
a
mist
once
as
i
paused
to
whet
my
scythe
my
eye
caught
the
line
of
the
untroubled
hills
strong
and
still
in
the
broad
sunshine
then
to
work
again
in
the
labouring
fertile
valley
rest
time
came
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
brow
and
blade
we
sought
the
welcome
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
the
cool
sweet
oatmeal
water
with
which
the
wise
reaper
quenches
his
thirst
farmer
marler
hastened
off
to
see
with
that
all
went
well
elsewhere
the
farm
men
slept
tranquilly
stretched
at
full
length
clasped
hands
for
pillow
and
old
dodden
sitting
with
crooked
fingers
interlaced
to
check
their
trembling
betrayal
of
old
age
told
how
in
his
youth
he
had
swep
a
field
in
three
almost
impossible
of

that

wi

old
dodden
s
quavering
voice
rose
and
fell
mournful
as
he
surveyed
the
present
vehement
as
he
recorded
the
heroic
past
he
spoke
of
the
rural
exodus
and
shook
his
head
mournfully
we
old
uns
were
content
wi
earth
and
the
open
sky
like
our
feythers
before

but

to

as
the
lard
said
till
time
comes
to
lie
under
i
looked
away
across
the
field
where
the
hot
air
throbbed
and
quivered
and
the
fallen
grass
robbed
already
of
its
freshness
lay
prone
at
the
feet
of
its
upstanding
fellows
it
is
quite
useless
to
argue
with
old
dodden
he
only
shakes
his
head
and
says
firmly
an
old
man
come
martinmass
knows
more
o
life
than
a
young
chap
stands
ter
reason
besides
his
epitome
of
the
town
life
he
knows
nothing
of
was
a
just
one
as
far
as
it
went
and
his
own
son
is
the
sweeper
of
a
holborn
crossing
and
many
other
things
that
he
should
not
be
but
that
is
the
parson
s
secret
and
mine
we
took
rank
again
and
swept
steadily
on
through
the
hot
still
hours
into
the
evening
shadows
until
the
sinking
sun
set
a
to
the
psalm
of
another
working
day
only
a
third
of
the
field
lay
mown
for
we
were
not
skilled
labourers
to
cut
our
acre
a
day
i
saw
it
again
that
night
under
the
moonlight
and
the
starlight
wrapped
in
a
shroud
of
summer
s
mist
the
women
joined
us
on
the
third
day
to
begin
haymaking
and
the
air
was
fragrant
of
tossed
and
grass
one
of
them
walked
apart
from
the
rest
without
interest
or
freedom
of
movement
her
face
sealed
and
impassive
was
aged
beyond
the
vigour
of
her
years
i
knew
the
woman
by
sight
and
her
history
by
hearsay
we
have
a
code
of
morals
indeed
peculiar
to
this
place
or
a
wedding
is
respectable
if
it
precedes
by
a
bare
month
tolerable
and
to
be
recognised
should
it
succeed
the
same
by
less
than
a
year
provided
the
pair
are
not
living
in
the
same
village
but
the
child
that
has
never
been
fathered
and
the
wife
without
a
ring
are
anathema
and
such
in
one
was
elizabeth
banks
she
went
away
a
maid
and
came
back
a
year
ago
with
a
child
and
without
a
name
her
mother
was
dead
her
father
and
the
village
would
have
none
of
her
the
homing
instinct
is
very
strong
or
she
would
scarcely
have
returned
knowing
the
traditions
of
the
place
old
dodden
seeing
her
grumbled
to
me
in
the
can
t
think
what
the
farmer
wants
wi
lizzie
banks
in
is
she
must
live
i
said
and
by
all
showing
her
life
is
a
hard
she
ad
the
makin
of
er
bed
he
went
on
obstinately
what
for
do
she
bring
her
disgrace
home
wi
a
fatherless
brat
for
all
folks
to
see
we
don
t
want
them
sort
in
our
village
the
lord
s
hand
is
heavy
an
a
brat
s
a
curse
that
can
not
be
when
came
i
crossed
the
field
to
look
for
a
missing
hone
and
saw
elizabeth
banks
far
from
the
other
women
busied
with
a
bundle
under
the
hedge
i
passed
close
on
my
search
and
lo
the
bundle
was
a
little
boy
he
lay
smiling
and
stretching
fighting
the
air
with
his
small
pink
fists
while
the
wind
played
with
his
curls
a
curse
that
can
not
be
hid
old
dodden
had
said
the
mother
knelt
a
moment
devouring
him
with
her
eyes
then
snatched
him
to
her
with
aching
greed
and
covered
him
with
kisses
i
saw
the
poor
plain
face
illumined
transfigured
alive
with
a
mother
s
love
and
remembered
how
the
word
came
once
to
a
hebrew
prophet
say
unto
your
brethren
ammi
and
to
your
sisters
ruhamah
the
evening
sky
was
clouding
fast
the
sound
of
rain
was
in
the
air
farmer
marler
shook
his
head
as
he
looked
at
the
grass
lying
in
ordered
rows
i
was
the
last
to
leave
and
as
i
lingered
at
the
gate
drinking
in
the
scent
of
the
field
and
the
cool
of
the
coming
rain
the
first
drops
fell
on
my
upturned
face
and
kissed
the
poor
dry
swathes
at
my
feet
and
i
was
glad
david
child
of
the
fields
and
the
sheepfolds
his
kingship
laid
aside
sees
through
the
parted
curtain
of
the
years
the
advent
of
his
greater
son
and
cries
in
his
psalm
of
the
hilltops
his
last
prophetic
prayer
he
shall
come
down
like
rain
upon
the
mown
grass
even
so
he
came
and
shall
still
come
three
days
ago
the
field
in
its
pageant
of
fresh
beauty
with
shimmering
blades
and
tossing
banners
greeted
sun
and
shower
alike
with
joy
for
the
furtherance
of
its
life
and
purpose
now
laid
low
it
hears
the
young
grass
whisper
the
splendour
of
its
coming
green
and
the
poor
swathes
are
glad
at
the
telling
but
full
of
grief
for
their
own
apparent
failure
then
in
great
pity
comes
the
rain
the
rain
of
summer
gentle
refreshing
penetrating
and
the
swathes
are
comforted
for
they
know
that
standing
to
greet
or
prostrate
to
suffer
the
consolations
of
the
former
and
the
latter
rain
are
still
their
own
with
tender
touch
and
cool
caress
then
once
more
parched
by
the
sun
they
are
borne
away
to
the
new
service
their
apparent
failure
has
fitted
them
for
and
perhaps
as
they
wait
in
the
dark
for
the
unknown
that
is
still
to
come
they
hear
sometimes
the
call
of
the
distant
rain
and
at
the
sound
the
dry
sap
stirs
are
not
forgotten
and
can
wait
unto
your
sisters
cries
the
prophet
shall
come
down
like
rain
on
the
mown

poet
of
the

ways

not
your

remember
how
i
went
home
along
the
damp
lanes
through
the
grey
mist
of
the
rain
thinking
of
the
mown
field
and
elizabeth
banks
and
many
many
more
and
that
night
when
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
nightingale
sang
i
looked
out
at
the
moon
riding
at
anchor
a
silver
boat
in
a
still
blue
sea
ablaze
with
the
headlights
of
the
stars
and
the
saying
of
the
herdsman
of

to
it
has
come
oftentimes
since
seek
him
that
maketh
the
seven
stars

and
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night
that
calleth
for

waters

this

is
an
epitome
of
peace
sun
and
wind
rain
flowers
and
birds
gather
me
into
the
blessedness
of
their
active
harmony
the
world
holds
no
wish
for
me
now
that
i
have
come
home
to
die
with
my
own
people
for
verify
i
think
that
the
sap
of
grass
and
trees
must
run
in
my
veins
so
steady
is
their
pull
upon
my
london
claimed
all
my
philosophy
but
the
country
gives
all
and
asks
of
me
only
the
warm
receptivity
of
a
child
in
its
mother
s
arms
when
i
lie
in
my
cool
light
room
on
the
garden
level
i
look
across
the
bright
verde
a
great
red
rose
bush
in
lavish
disarray
against
the
dark
cypress
near
by
amid
a
tangle
of
i
see
the
promise
of
coming
lilies
the
sudden
crimson
of
a
solitary
pÃ¦ony
and
in
lowlier
state
against
the
poor
parched
earth
glow
the
golden
cups
of
the
eschseholtzias
beyond
the
low
hedge
lies
pasture
bright
with
buttercups
where
the
cattle
feed
farther
off
where
the
scythe
has
been
busy
are
sheep
clean
and
shorn
with
merry
lambs
and
in
the
farthest
field
i
can
see
the
great
horses
moving
in
slow
steady
pace
as
the
farmer
turns
his
furrow
the
birds
are
noisy
comrades
and
old
friends
from
the
lark
which
chants
the
morning
to
the
nightingale
that
breaks
the
silence
of
the
most
wonderful
nights
i
hear
the
wisdom
of
the
rooks
in
the
great
elms
the
lifting
lilt
of
the
linnet
and
the
robin
s
quaint
little
summer
song
the
starlings
chatter
ceaselessly
their
queer
strident
voices
harsh
against
the
melodious
gossip
of
the
other
birds
the
martins
shrill
softly
as
they
swoop
to
and
fro
busied
with
their
nesting
under
the
caves
thrush
and
blackbird
vie
in
friendly
rivalry
like
the
of
old
sometimes
i
hear
the
drawling
cry
of
a
peacock
strayed
from
the
great
house
or
the
laugh
of
the
woodpecker
and
at
night
the
hunting
note
of
the
owl
reaches
me
as
he
sweeps
by
in
search
of
prey
i
am
out
again
and
the
great
sycamore
showers
honey
and
flowers
on
me
as
i
lie
beneath
it
sometimes
a
bee
falls
like
an
fruit
and
waits
awhile
to
clean
his
legs
ere
he
flies
home
to
discharge
his
burden
he
is
too
busy
to
be
friendly
but
his
great
velvety
cousin
is
much
more
sociable
and
stays
for
a
gentle
rub
between
his
noisy
shimmering
wings
and
a
nap
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
for
he
is
an
idle
friendly
soul
with
plenty
of
time
at
his
own
disposal
and
no
responsibilities
looking
across
i
can
watch
the
martins
at
work
they
have
a
starling
and
a
sparrow
for
near
neighbours
in
the
wooden
gutter
one
nest
is
already
complete
all
but
the
coping
the
other
two
are
i
wonder
whether
i
or
they
will
be
first
to
go
south
through
the
mist
this
great
tree
is
a
world
in
itself
and
the
denizens
appear
full
of
curiosity
as
to
the
gulliver
who
has
taken
up
his
abode
beneath
it
pale
green
caterpillars
and
spiders
of
all
sizes
come
spinning
down
to
visit
me
and
have
to
be
persuaded
with
infinite
difficulty
to
ascend
their
threads
again
there
are
flies
with
beautiful
iridescent
wings
beetles
of
all
shapes
some
of
them
like
tiny
jewels
in
the
sunlight
their
nomenclature
is
a
sealed
book
to
me
of
their
life
and
habits
i
know
nothing
yet
this
is
but
a
little
corner
of
the
cosmos
i
am
leaving
and
i
feel
not
so
much
desire
for
the
beauty
to
come
as
a
great
longing
to
open
my
eyes
a
little
wider
during
the
time
which
remains
to
me
in
this
beautiful
world
of
god
s
making
where
each
moment
tells
its
own
tale
of
active
progressive
life
in
which
there
is
no
undoing
nature
knows
naught
of
the
web
of
penelope
that
acme
of
anxious
pathetic
waiting
but
goes
steadily
on
in
ever
widening
circle
towards
the
fulfilment
of
the
mystery
of
god
there
are
i
take
it
two
to
the
secrets
of
the
universe
viewed
specie
the
incarnation
of
god
and
the
personality
of
man
with
these
it
is
true
for
us
as
for
the
pantheistic
little
man
of
contemptible
speech
that
all
things
are
ours
yea
even
unto
the
third
heaven
i
have
lost
my
voracious
appetite
for
books
their
language
is
less
plain
than
scent
and
song
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
for
me
the
clue
to
the
next
world
lies
in
the
wisdom
of
earth
rather
than
in
the
learning
of
men
me
ab
fuscina
prayed
the
good
bishop
fearful
of
religious
greed
i
know
too
much
not
too
little
it
is
realisation
that
i
lack
wherefore
i
desire
these
last
days
to
confirm
in
myself
the
sustaining
goodness
of
god
the
love
which
is
our
continuing
city
the
new
jerusalem
whose
length
breadth
and
height
are
all
one
it
is
a
time
of
exceeding
peace
there
is
a
place
waiting
for
me
under
the
firs
in
the
quiet
churchyard
thanks
to
my
poverty
i
have
no
worldly
anxieties
or
personal
dispositions
and
i
am
rich
in
friends
many
of
them
unknown
to
me
who
lavishly
supply
my
needs
and
make
it
ideal
to
live
on
the
charity
of
one
s
i
am
most
gladly
in
debt
to
all
the
world
and
to
earth
my
mother
for
her
great
beauty
i
can
never
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
love
her
this
mother
of
mine
with
her
wonderful
garments
and
ordered
loveliness
her
tender
care
and
patient
bearing
of
man
s
burden
in
the
earliest
days
of
my
lonely
childhood
i
used
to
lie
chin
on
hand
amid
the
milkmaids
red
sorrel
and
heavy
listening
to
her
many
voices
and
above
all
to
the
voice
of
the
little
brook
which
ran
through
the
meadows
where
i
used
to
play
i
think
it
has
run
through
my
whole
life
also
to
lose
itself
at
last
not
in
the
great
sea
but
in
the
river
that
maketh
glad
the
city
of
god
valley
and
plain
mountain
and
fruitful
field
the
lark
s
song
and
the
speedwell
in
the
grass
surely
a
man
need
not
sigh
for
greater
loveliness
until
he
has
read
something
more
of
this
living
letter
and
knelt
before
that
earth
of
which
he
is
the
only
confusion
it
is
a
grave
matter
that
the
word
religion
holds
such
away
among
us
making
the
very
gap
seem
to
yawn
again
which
the
incarnation
once
and
for
ever
filled
full
we
have
banished
the
protecting
gods
that
ruled
in
river
and
mountain
tree
and
grove
we
have
gainsayed
for
the
most
part
and
myth
superstition
and
evil
only
in
their
abuse
we
have
done
away
with
mystery
or
named
it
deceit
all
this
we
have
done
in
an
enlightened
age
but
despite
this
policy
of
destruction
we
have
left
ourselves
a
belief
the
grandest
and
most
simple
the
world
has
ever
known
which
sanctifies
the
water
that
is
shed
by
every
passing
cloud
and
gathers
up
in
its
great
central
act
vineyard
and
cornfield
proclaiming
them
to
be
that
life
of
the
world
without
which
a
man
is
dead
while
he
liveth
further
it
is
a
belief
whose
foundations
are
the
most
heavenly
mystery
of
the
trinity
but
whose
centre
is
a
little
child
it
sets
a
price
upon
the
head
of
the
sparrow
and
reckons
the
riches
of
this
world
at
their
true
value
it
points
to
a
way
of
holiness
where
the
fool
shall
not
err
and
the
sage
may
find
the
realisation
of
his
and
yet
despite
its
inclusiveness
it
is
a
belief
which
can
not
save
the
birds
from
destruction
the
silent
mountains
from
advertisement
or
the
stream
from
pollution
in
an
avowedly
christian
land
john
ruskin
scolded
and
fought
and
did
yeoman
service
somewhat
hindered
by
his
conceit
of
himself
but
it
is
not
the
worship
of
beauty
we
need
so
much
as
the
beauty
of
holiness
little
by
little
the
barrier
grows
and
religion
becomes
a
of
life
not
life
itself
although
the
bride
stands
ready
to
interpret
likened
in
her
loveliness
to
the
chief
treasures
of
her
there
is
more
truth
in
the
believing
cry
come
from
thy
white
cliffs
o
pan
than
in
the
religion
that
measures
a
man
s
life
by
the
letter
of
the
ten
commandments
and
erects
itself
as
judge
and
ruler
over
him
instead
of
throwing
open
the
gate
of
the
garden
where
god
walks
with
man
from
morning
until
morning
as
i
write
the
sun
is
setting
in
the
pale
radiance
of
the
sky
above
his
glory
there

the
evening

like

her

of

chapter
iii
once
again
i
have
paid
a
rare
visit
to
my
tree
to
find
many
things
changed
since
my
last
sojourn
there
the
bees
are
silent
for
the
flowers
of
the
sycamore
are
gone
and
in
their
place
hang
dainty
keys
the
poplar
has
lost
its
metallic
shimmer
the
chestnut
its
tall
white
candles
and
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
branches
is
like
the
sighing
of
the
sea
the
martins
nests
are
finished
and
one
is
occupied
by
a
brood
but
for
the
most
part
the
birds
parental
cares
are
over
and
the
nestlings
in
bold
flight
no
longer
flutter
on
inefficient
wings
across
the
lawn
with
clamorous
open
bill
the
robins
show
promise
of
their
ruddy
vests
the
slim
young
thrush
is
diligently
practising
maturer
notes
and
soon
maid
june
will
have
fled
it
is
such
a
wonderful
world
that
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
sigh
for
fresh
beauty
amid
these
glories
of
the
lord
on
which
i
look
seeing
men
as
trees
walking
in
my
material
impotence
which
awaits
the
final
anointing
the
marigolds
with
their
orange
suns
the
lilies
white
flame
the
corncockle
s
blue
crown
of
many
flowers
the
honeysuckle
s
horn
of
can
paraphrase
them
name
class
dissect
them
and
then
save
for
the
purposes
of
human
intercourse
i
stand
where
i
stood
before
my
world
bounded
by
my
capacity
the
secret
of
colour
and
fragrance
still
kept
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
second
lesson
will
not
be
the
sequence
of
the
first
and
death
prove
a
feast
of
opening
eyes
to
all
these
wonders
instead
of
the
slumber
to
which
we
so
often
liken
it
earth
to
earth
yes
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
thou
shalt
return
but
what
of
the
rest
what
of
the
folded
grave
clothes
and
the
forty
days
if
the
next
state
be
as
it
well
might
space
of
four
dimensions
and
the
first
veil
which
will
lift
for
me
be
the
material
one
then
the
other
world
which
is
hidden
from
our
grosser
material
organism
will
lie
open
and
declare
still
further
to
my
widening
eyes
and
unstopped
ears
the
glory
and
purpose
of
the
manifold
garment
of
god
knowledge
will
give
place
to
understanding
in
that
second
chamber
of
the
house
of
wisdom
and
love
revelation
is
always
measured
by
capacity
open
thy
mouth
wide
and
it
shall
be
filled
with
a
satisfaction
that
in
itself
is
desire
there
is
a
child
here
a
happy
quiet
little
creature
holding
gently
to
its
two
months
of
life
sometimes
they
lay
it
beside
me
i
the
more
helpless
of
the
the
more
equally
dependent
for
the
supply
of
my
smallest
need
i
feel
indecently
large
as
i
survey
its
minute
perfections
and
the
tiny
balled
fist
lying
in
my
great
palm
the
little
creature
fixes
me
with
the
wise
wide
stare
of
a
soul
in
advance
of
its
medium
of
expression
and
i
gazing
back
at
the
mystery
in
those
eyes
feel
the
thrill
of
contact
between
my
worn
and
sustained
self
and
the
innocence
of
a
little
white
child
it
is
wonderful
to
watch
a
woman
s
rapturous
familiarity
with
these
newcomers
a
man
s
love
has
far
more
awe
in
it
and
the
passionate
animal
instinct
of
defence
is
wanting
in
him
a
woman
shall
be
saved
through
the
said
st
paul
not
necessarily
her
own
but
by
participation
in
the
great
act
of
motherhood
which
is
the
crown
and
glory
of
her
sex
she
is
the
prisoner
of
love
caught
in
a
net
of
her
own
weaving
held
fast
by
little
hands
which
rule
by
impotence
pursued
by
feet
the
swifter
for
their
faltering
it
seems
incredible
that
this
is
what
a
woman
will
barter
for
the
right
to
live
her
own
life
the
most
empty
of
desires
go
to
make
up
there
can
be
no
comparison
no
rivalry
between
them
they
are
the
complement
of
each
other
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
desire
to
shelter
under
the
dear
mantle
of
motherhood
which
has
led
to
one
of
the
abuses
of
modern
romanism
i
met
an
old
peasant
couple
at
bornhofen
who
had
tramped
many
weary
miles
to
the
famous
shrine
of
our
lady
to
plead
for
their
only
son
they
had
a
few
pence
saved
for
a
candle
and
afterwards
when
they
told
me
their
tale
the
old
woman
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
es
wird
bald
gut
gehen
die
da
sie
versteht
and
i
saw
her
later
paying
a
farewell
visit
to
the
great
understanding
mother
whom
she
could
trust
superstitious
misapprehension
if
you
will
but
also
the
recognition
of
a
divine
principle
it
was
behmen
i
believe
who
cried
with
the
breath
of
inspiration
only
when
i
know
god
shall
i
know
myself
and
so
man
remains
the
last
of
all
the
riddles
to
be
solved
it
may
be
only
in
heaven
s
perfection
and
the
light
of
the
beatific
vision
know
thyself
is
a
vain
legend
the
more
so
when
emphasised
by
a
skull
and
so
i
company
with
a
friend
and
a
stranger
and
looking
across
at
the
white
gate
i
wonder
concerning
the
quiet
pastures
and
still
waters
that
lie
beyond
even
as
brother
ambrose
wondered
long
years
ago
in
the
monastery
by
the
forest
the
brother
ambrose
was
ever
a
saintly
man
approved
of
god
and
beloved
by
the
brethren
to
him
one
night
as
he
lay
abed
in
the
dormitory
came
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
come
and
i
will
show
thee
the
bride
the
lamb
s
and
brother
ambrose
arose
and
was
carried
to
a
great
and
high
mountain
even
as
in
the
vision
of
blessed
john
twas
a
still
night
of
many
stars
and
brother
ambrose
looking
up
saw
a
radiant
path
in
the
heavens
and
lo
the
stars
gathered
themselves
together
on
either
side
until
they
stood
as
walls
of
light
and
the
four
winds
lapped
him
about
as
in
a
mantle
and
bore
him
towards
the
wondrous
gleaming
roadway
then
between
the
stars
came
the
holy
city
with
roof
and
pinnacle
aflame
and
walls
aglow
with
such
colours
as
no
earthly
limner
dreams
of
and
much
gold
brother
ambrose
beheld
the
gates
of
pearl
and
by
every
gate
an
angel
with
wings
of
snow
and
fire
and
a
face
no
man
dare
look
on
because
of
its
exceeding
radiance
then
as
brother
ambrose
stretched
out
his
arms
because
of
his
great
longing
a
little
grey
cloud
came
out
of
the
north
and
hung
between
the
walls
of
light
so
that
he
no
longer
beheld
the
vision
but
only
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
great
multitude
crying
alleluia
and
suddenly
the
winds
came
about
him
again
and
lo
he
found
himself
in
his
bed
in
the
dormitory
and
it
was
midnight
for
the
bell
was
ringing
to
matins
and
he
rose
and
went
down
with
the
rest
but
when
the
brethren
left
the
choir
brother
ambrose
stayed
fast
in
his
place
hearing
and
seeing
nothing
because
of
the
vision
of
god
and
at
lauds
they
found
him
and
told
the
prior
he
questioned
brother
ambrose
of
the
matter
and
when
he
heard
the
vision
bade
him
limn
the
holy
city
even
as
he
had
seen
it
and
the
precentor
gave
him
uterine
vellum
and
much
fine
gold
and
what
colours
he
asked
for
the
work
then
brother
ambrose
limned
a
wondrous
fair
city
of
gold
with
turrets
and
spires
and
he
inlaid
blue
for
the
sapphire
and
green
for
the
emerald
and
vermilion
where
the
city
seemed
aflame
with
the
glory
of
god
but
the
angels
he
could
not
limn
nor
could
he
set
the
rest
of
the
colours
as
he
saw
them
nor
the
wall
of
stars
on
either
hand
and
brother
ambrose
fell
sick
because
of
the
exceeding
great
longing
he
had
to
limn
the
holy
city
and
was
very
sad
but
the
prior
bade
him
thank
god
and
remember
the
infirmity
of
the
flesh
which
like
the
little
grey
cloud
veiled
jerusalem
to
his
sight
as
i
write
the
monastery
bell
hard
by
rings
out
across
the
lark
s
song
they
still
have
time
for
visions
behind
those
guarding
walls
but
for
most
of
us
it
is
not
so
we
let
slip
the
ideal
for
what
we
call
the
real
and
the
golden
dreams
vanish
while
we
clutch
at
phantoms
we
speed
along
life
s
pathway
counting
to
the
full
the
sixty
minutes
of
every
hour
yet
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong
lying
here
in
this
quiet
backwater
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
the
world
without
is
turbulent
with
storm
and
stress
and
the
ebb
and
flow
of
uncertain
tides
the
little
yellow
cat
rolling
on
its
back
among
the
daisies
the
staid
tortoise
making
a
stately
meal
off
the
buttercups
near
me
these
are
great
events
in
this
haven
of
peace
and
yet
looking
back
to
the
working
days
i
know
how
much
goodness
and
loving
kindness
there
is
under
the
froth
and
foam
if
we
do
not
know
ourselves
we
most
certainly
do
not
know
our
brethren
that
revelation
awaits
us
it
may
be
first
in
heaven
to
have
faith
is
to
create
to
have
hope
is
to
call
down
blessing
to
have
love
is
to
work
miracles
above
all
let
us
see
visions
visions
of
colour
and
light
of
green
fields
and
broad
rivers
of
palaces
laid
with
fair
colours
and
gardens
where
a
place
is
found
for
rosemary
and
rue
it
is
our
prerogative
to
be
dreamers
but
there
will
always
be
men
ready
to
offer
us
death
for
our
dreams
and
if
it
must
be
so
let
us
choose
death
it
is
gain
not
loss
and
the
gloomy
portal
when
we
reach
it
is
but
a
white
gate
the
white
gate
maybe
we
have
known
all
our
lives
barred
by
the
tendrils
of
the
woodbine
chapter
iv
rain
rain
rain
the
little
flagged
path
outside
my
window
is
a
streaming
way
where
the
coming
raindrops
meet
again
the
grey
clouds
whose
storehouse
they
have
but
just
now
left
the
grass
grows
greener
as
i
watch
it
the
burnt
patches
fade
a
thousand
thirsty
beads
are
uplifted
for
the
cooling
draught
the
great
thrush
that
robs
the
raspberry
canes
is
busy
yesterday
he
had
little
but
dust
for
his
guerdon
but
now
fresh
juicy
fruit
repays
him
as
he
swings
to
and
fro
on
the
pliant
branches
the
blackbirds
and
starlings
find
the
worms
an
easy
brother
worm
ever
ready
for
sacrifice
i
can
hear
the
soft
expectant
chatter
of
the
family
of
martins
under
the
roof
there
will
be
good
hunting
and
they
know
it
for
the
flies
are
out
when
the
rain
is
over
and
there
are
clamorous
mouths
awaiting
my
little
brown
brothers
the
sparrows
remain
my
chief
delight
of
all
the
birds
these
nestle
closest
to
my
heart
be
they
grimy
little
cockneys
or
their
trim
and
dainty
country
cousins
they
come
day
by
day
for
their
meed
of
crumbs
spread
for
them
outside
my
window
and
at
this
season
they
eat
leisurely
and
with
good
appetite
for
there
are
no
hungry
babies
pestering
to
be
fed
very
early
in
the
morning
i
hear
the
whirr
and
rustle
of
eager
wings
and
the
tap
tap
of
little
beaks
upon
the
stone
the
sound
carries
me
back
for
it
was
the
first
to
greet
me
when
i
rose
to
draw
water
and
gather
kindling
in
my
roadmender
days
and
if
i
slip
back
another
decade
they
survey
me
reproving
my
laziness
from
the
foot
of
the
narrow
bed
in
my
little
attic
overseas
looking
along
the
roadway
that
we
have
travelled
we
see
the
landmarks
great
and
small
which
have
determined
the
direction
of
our
feet
for
some
those
of
childhood
stand
out
above
all
the
rest
but
i
remember
few
notable
ones
and
those
few
the
emphatic
chord
of
the
universe
rather
than
any
commerce
with
my
fellows
there
was
the
night
of
my
great
disappointment
when
i
was
borne
from
my
comfortable
bed
to
see
the
wonders
of
the
moon
s
eclipse
disappointment
was
so
great
that
it
sealed
my
lips
but
once
back
on
my
pillow
i
sobbed
for
grief
that
i
had
seen
a
wonder
so
far
below
my
expectation
then
there
was
a
night
at
whitby
when
the
wind
made
speech
impossible
and
the
seas
rushed
up
and
over
the
great
lighthouse
like
the
hungry
spirits
of
the
deep
i
like
better
to
remember
the
scent
of
the
first
cowslip
field
under
the
warm
side
of
the
hedge
when
i
sang
to
myself
for
pure
joy
of
their
colour
and
fragrance
again
there
were
the
bluebells
in
the
deserted
quarry
like
the
backwash
of
a
southern
sea
and
below
them
the
miniature
forest
of
sheltering
bracken
with
its
quaint
conceits
and
crowned
above
all
the
day
i
stood
on
watcombe
down
and
looked
across
a
stretch
of
golden
gorse
and
field
the
green
of
the
headland
and
beyond
the
sapphire
sea
time
sped
and
there
came
a
day
when
i
first
set
foot
on
german
soil
and
felt
the
throb
of
its
paternity
the
beat
of
our
common
life
england
is
my
mother
and
most
dearly
do
i
love
her
swelling
breasts
and
hair
scotland
gave
me
my
name
with
its
haunting
derivation
handed
down
by
brave
men
but
germany
has
always
been
to
me
the
fatherland
true
my
love
is
limited
to
the
southern
provinces
with
their
medieval
memories
for
the
progressive
guttural
north
i
have
little
sympathy
but
the
rhine
claimed
me
from
the
first
calling
calling
with
that
wonderful
voice
which
speaks
of
death
and
life
of
chivalry
and
greed
of
gold
if
you
would
have
the
river
s
company
you
should
wander
a
happy
solitary
along
its
banks
watching
its
gleaming
current
in
the
early
morning
its
golden
glory
as
it
answers
the
farewell
of
parting
day
then
in
the
silence
of
the
night
you
can
hear
the
wash
and
eddy
calling
one
to
another
count
the
of
the
great
bearer
of
burdens
and
watch
in
the
moonlight
the
sisters
of
the
mist
as
they
lament
with
wringing
hands
the
days
that
are
gone
the
forests
too
are
ready
with
story
hid
in
the
fastness
of
their
solitude
and
it
is
a
joy
to
think
that
those
great
pines
pointing
ever
upwards
go
for
the
most
part
to
carry
the
sails
of
great
ships
seeking
afar
under
open
sky
the
forest
holds
other
wonders
still
it
seems
but
last
night
that
i
wandered
down
the
road
which
led
to
the
little
unheeded
village
where
i
had
made
my
temporary
home
the
breath
of
the
pines
and
the
stillness
of
the
night
wrapped
me
in
great
content
the
summer
lightning
leapt
in
a
lambent
arch
across
the
east
and
the
stars
seen
dimly
through
the
sombre
tree
crests
were
outrivalled
by
the
which
shone
in
countless
points
of
light
from
bank
and
hedge
even
two
who
passed
with
friendly
greeting
had
wreathed
their
hats
with
the
living
flame
the
tiny
shifting
lamps
were
everywhere
pale
yellow
purely
white
or
green
as
the
underside
of
a
northern
wave
by
day
but
an
ugly
repellent
worm
but
darkness
comes
and
lo
a
star
alight
nature
is
full
for
us
of
seeming
inconsistencies
and
glad
surprises
the
world
s
asleep
say
you
on
your
ear
falls
the
nightingale
s
song
and
the
stir
of
living
creatures
in
bush
and
brake
the
mantle
of
night
falls
and
all
unattended
the
wind
leaps
up
and
scatters
the
clouds
which
veil
the
constant
stars
or
in
the
hour
of
the
great
dark
dawn
parts
the
curtain
with
the
long
foregleam
of
the
coming
day
it
is
hard
to
turn
one
s
back
on
night
with
her
kiss
of
peace
for
tired
the
kiss
which
is
not
sleep
but
its
neglected
forerunner
i
made
my
way
at
last
down
to
the
bridge
asleep
under
the
stars
and
up
the
winding
stairs
of
the
old
grey
tower
and
a
stone
away
the
rhine
slipped
quietly
past
in
the
midsummer
moonlight
switzerland
came
in
its
turn
unearthly
in
its
white
loveliness
and
glory
of
lake
and
sky
but
perhaps
the
landmark
which
stands
out
most
clearly
is
the
solitary
blue
gentian
which
i
found
in
the
short
slippery
grass
of
the
rigi
gazing
up
at
the
sky
whose
blue
could
not
hope
to
excel
it
it
was
my
first
and
what
need
of
another
for
finding
one
i
had
gazed
into
the
mystery
of
all
this
side
the
pass
snow
and
the
blue
of
heaven
later
i
entered
italy
through
fields
of
lilies
her
past
glories
blazoned
in
the
flowers
of
the
field
now
it
is
a
strangely
uneventful
road
that
leads
to
my
white
gate
each
day
questions
me
as
it
passes
each
day
makes
answer
for
me
not
there
is
no
material
preparation
to
be
made
for
this
journey
of
mine
into
a
far
simple
fact
which
adds
to
the
unknowableness
of
the
other
side
do
i
travel
alone
or
am
i
one
of
a
great
company
swift
yet
unhurried
in
their
passage
the
voices
of
penelope
s
suitors
shrilled
on
the
ears
of
ulysses
as
they
journeyed
to
the
like
nocturnal
birds
and
bats
in
the
inarticulateness
of
their
speech
they
had
abused
the
gift
and
fled
maybe
silence
commends
itself
as
most
suitable
for
the
wayfarers
towards
the
because
they
seek
the
for
those
hastening
towards
the
confusion
they
have
wrought
there
falls
already
the
sharp
oncoming
of
the
curse
while
we
are
still
here
the
language
of
worship
seems
far
and
yet
lies
very
nigh
for
what
better
note
can
our
frail
tongues
lisp
than
the
voice
of
wind
and
sea
river
and
stream
those
grateful
servants
giving
all
and
asking
nothing
the
soft
whisper
of
snow
and
rain
eager
to
replenish
or
the
thunder
proclaiming
a
majesty
too
great
for
utterance
here
too
stands
the
angel
with
the
censer
gathering
up
the
fragrance
of
teeming
earth
and
of
flower
and
fruit
and
sweetly
pungent
herb
distilled
by
sun
and
rain
for
joyful
use
here
too
come
acolytes
lighting
the
dark
with
moon
and
of
the
lord
that
his
sanctuary
may
stand
ever
served
it
lies
here
ready
to
our
hand
this
life
of
adoration
which
we
needs
must
live
hand
in
hand
with
earth
for
has
she
not
borne
the
curse
with
us
but
beyond
the
white
gate
and
the
trail
of
woodbine
falls
the
silence
greater
than
speech
darkness
greater
than
light
a
pause
of
a
little
while
and
then
the
touch
of
that
healing
garment
as
we
pass
to
the
king
in
his
beauty
in
a
land
from
which
there
is
no
return
at
the
gateway
then
i
cry
you
farewell
