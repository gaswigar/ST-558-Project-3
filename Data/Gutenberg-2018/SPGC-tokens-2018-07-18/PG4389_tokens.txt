introduction
to
the
third
edition
published
by
richard
bentley
in
in
most
instances
emigration
is
a
matter
of
necessity
not
of
choice
and
this
is
more
especially
true
of
the
emigration
of
persons
of
respectable
connections
or
of
any
station
or
position
in
the
world
few
educated
persons
accustomed
to
the
refinements
and
luxuries
of
european
society
ever
willingly
relinquish
those
advantages
and
place
themselves
beyond
the
protective
influence
of
the
wise
and
revered
institutions
of
their
native
land
without
the
pressure
of
some
urgent
cause
emigration
may
indeed
generally
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
severe
duty
performed
at
the
expense
of
personal
enjoyment
and
accompanied
by
the
sacrifice
of
those
local
attachments
which
stamp
the
scenes
amid
which
our
childhood
grew
in
imperishable
characters
upon
the
heart
nor
is
it
until
adversity
has
pressed
sorely
upon
the
proud
and
wounded
spirit
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
old
but
impoverished
families
that
they
gird
up
the
loins
of
the
mind
and
arm
themselves
with
fortitude
to
meet
and
dare
the
conflict
the
ordinary
motives
for
the
emigration
of
such
persons
may
be
summed
up
in
a
few
brief
words
the
emigrant
hope
of
bettering
his
condition
and
of
escaping
from
the
vulgar
sarcasms
too
often
hurled
at
the
by
the
people
of
the
world
but
there
is
a
higher
motive
still
which
has
its
origin
in
that
love
of
independence
which
springs
up
spontaneously
in
the
breasts
of
the
children
of
a
glorious
land
they
can
not
labour
in
a
menial
capacity
in
the
country
where
they
were
born
and
educated
to
command
they
can
trace
no
difference
between
themselves
and
the
more
fortunate
individuals
of
a
race
whose
blood
warms
their
veins
and
whose
name
they
bear
the
want
of
wealth
alone
places
an
impassable
barrier
between
them
and
the
more
favoured
offspring
of
the
same
parent
stock
and
they
go
forth
to
make
for
themselves
a
new
name
and
to
find
another
country
to
forget
the
past
and
to
live
in
the
future
to
exult
in
the
prospect
of
their
children
being
free
and
the
land
of
their
adoption
great
the
choice
of
the
country
to
which
they
devote
their
talents
and
energies
depends
less
upon
their
pecuniary
means
than
upon
the
fancy
of
the
emigrant
or
the
popularity
of
a
name
from
the
year
to
australia
and
the
swan
river
were
all
the
rage
no
other
portions
of
the
habitable
globe
were
deemed
worthy
of
notice
these
were
the
el
dorados
and
lands
of
goshen
to
which
all
respectable
emigrants
eagerly
flocked
disappointment
as
a
matter
of
course
followed
their
expectations
many
of
the
most
sanguine
of
these
adventurers
returned
to
their
native
shores
in
a
worse
condition
than
when
they
left
them
in
the
great
tide
of
emigration
flowed
westward
canada
became
the
great
for
the
rich
in
hope
and
poor
in
purse
public
newspapers
and
private
letters
teemed
with
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
settlement
in
this
region
its
salubrious
climate
its
fertile
soil
commercial
advantages
great
water
privileges
its
proximity
to
the
mother
country
and
last
not
least
its
almost
total
exemption
from
taxation
that
bugbear
which
keeps
honest
john
bull
in
a
state
of
constant
ferment
were
the
theme
of
every
tongue
and
lauded
beyond
all
praise
the
general
interest
once
excited
was
industriously
kept
alive
by
pamphlets
published
by
interested
parties
which
prominently
set
forth
all
the
good
to
be
derived
from
a
settlement
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
while
they
carefully
concealed
the
toil
and
hardship
to
be
endured
in
order
to
secure
these
advantages
they
told
of
lands
yielding
forty
bushels
to
the
acre
but
they
said
nothing
of
the
years
when
these
lands
with
the
most
careful
cultivation
would
barely
return
fifteen
when
rust
and
smut
engendered
by
the
vicinity
of
damp
woods
would
blast
the
fruits
of
the
poor
emigrant
labour
and
almost
deprive
him
of
bread
they
talked
of
log
houses
to
be
raised
in
a
single
day
by
the
generous
exertions
of
friends
and
neighbours
but
they
never
ventured
upon
a
picture
of
the
disgusting
scenes
of
riot
and
low
debauchery
exhibited
during
the
raising
or
upon
a
description
of
the
dwellings
when
raised
dens
of
dirt
and
misery
which
would
in
many
instances
be
shamed
by
an
english
the
necessaries
of
life
were
described
as
inestimably
cheap
but
they
forgot
to
add
that
in
remote
bush
settlements
often
twenty
miles
from
a
market
town
and
some
of
them
even
that
distance
from
the
nearest
dwelling
the
necessaries
of
life
which
would
be
deemed
indispensable
to
the
european
could
not
be
procured
at
all
or
if
obtained
could
only
be
so
by
sending
a
man
and
team
through
a
blazed
forest
road
a
process
far
too
expensive
for
frequent
repetition
oh
ye
dealers
in
wild
lands
ye
speculators
in
the
folly
and
credulity
of
your
fellow
men
what
a
mass
of
misery
and
of
misrepresentation
productive
of
that
misery
have
ye
not
to
answer
for
you
had
your
acres
to
sell
and
what
to
you
were
the
frames
and
broken
hearts
of
the
infatuated
purchasers
the
public
believed
the
plausible
statements
you
made
with
such
earnestness
and
men
of
all
grades
rushed
to
hear
your
hired
orators
declaim
upon
the
blessings
to
be
obtained
by
the
clearers
of
the
wilderness
men
who
had
been
hopeless
of
supporting
their
families
in
comfort
and
independence
at
home
thought
that
they
had
only
to
come
out
to
canada
to
make
their
fortunes
almost
even
to
realise
the
story
told
in
the
nursery
of
the
sheep
and
oxen
that
ran
about
the
streets
ready
roasted
and
with
knives
and
forks
upon
their
backs
they
were
made
to
believe
that
if
it
did
not
actually
rain
gold
that
precious
metal
could
be
obtained
as
is
now
stated
of
california
and
australia
by
stooping
to
pick
it
up
the
infection
became
general
a
canada
mania
pervaded
the
middle
ranks
of
british
society
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
for
the
space
of
three
or
four
years
landed
upon
these
shores
a
large
majority
of
the
higher
class
were
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
with
their
families
a
class
perfectly
unfitted
by
their
previous
habits
and
education
for
contending
with
the
stern
realities
of
emigrant
life
the
hand
that
has
long
held
the
sword
and
been
accustomed
to
receive
implicit
obedience
from
those
under
its
control
is
seldom
adapted
to
wield
the
spade
and
guide
the
plough
or
try
its
strength
against
the
stubborn
trees
of
the
forest
nor
will
such
persons
submit
cheerfully
to
the
saucy
familiarity
of
servants
who
republicans
in
spirit
think
themselves
as
good
as
their
employers
too
many
of
these
brave
and
honourable
men
were
easy
dupes
to
the
designing
not
having
counted
the
cost
but
only
looked
upon
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
held
up
to
their
admiring
gaze
they
fell
easily
into
the
snares
of
their
artful
seducers
to
prove
their
zeal
as
colonists
they
were
induced
to
purchase
large
tracts
of
wild
land
in
remote
and
unfavourable
situations
this
while
it
impoverished
and
often
proved
the
ruin
of
the
unfortunate
immigrant
possessed
a
double
advantage
to
the
seller
he
obtained
an
exorbitant
price
for
the
land
which
he
actually
sold
while
the
residence
of
a
respectable
settler
upon
the
spot
greatly
enhanced
the
value
and
price
of
all
other
lands
in
the
neighbourhood
it
is
not
by
such
instruments
as
those
i
have
just
mentioned
that
providence
works
when
it
would
reclaim
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
and
make
them
subservient
to
the
wants
and
happiness
of
its
creatures
the
great
father
of
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
knows
the
arm
which
wholesome
labour
from
infancy
has
made
strong
the
nerves
which
have
become
iron
by
patient
endurance
by
exposure
to
weather
coarse
fare
and
rude
shelter
and
he
chooses
such
to
send
forth
into
the
forest
to
hew
out
the
rough
paths
for
the
advance
of
civilization
these
men
become
wealthy
and
prosperous
and
form
the
bones
and
sinews
of
a
great
and
rising
country
their
labour
is
wealth
not
exhaustion
its
produce
independence
and
content
not
and
despair
what
the
backwoods
of
canada
are
to
the
industrious
and
sons
of
honest
poverty
and
what
they
are
to
the
refined
and
accomplished
gentleman
these
simple
sketches
will
endeavour
to
portray
they
are
drawn
principally
from
my
own
experience
during
a
sojourn
of
nineteen
years
in
the
colony
in
order
to
diversify
my
subject
and
make
it
as
amusing
as
possible
i
have
between
the
sketches
introduced
a
few
small
poems
all
written
during
my
residence
in
canada
and
descriptive
of
the
country
in
this
pleasing
task

to

alas
that
man
stern
spirit
should
mar
a
scene
so
pure
so
exquisite
as
this
the
dreadful
cholera
was
depopulating
quebec
and
montreal
when
our
ship
cast
anchor
off
grosse
isle
on
the
of
august
and
we
were
boarded
a
few
minutes
after
by
the
one
of
these
gentlemen
a
little
frenchman
from
his
solemn
aspect
and
attenuated
figure
would
have
made
no
bad
representative
of
him
who
sat
upon
the
pale
horse
he
was
the
only
grave
frenchman
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
naturally
enough
regarded
him
as
a
phenomenon
his
companion
a
scotchman
though
a
little
consequential
in
his
manners
looked
like
one
who
in
his
own
person
could
combat
and
vanquish
all
the
evils
which
flesh
is
heir
to
such
was
the
contrast
between
these
doctors
that
they
would
have
formed
very
good
emblems
one
of
vigorous
health
the
other
of
hopeless
decay
our
captain
a
rude
blunt
sailor
possessing
certainly
not
more
politeness
than
might
be
expected
in
a
bear
received
his
sprucely
dressed
visitors
on
the
deck
and
with
very
little
courtesy
abruptly
bade
them
follow
him
down
into
the
cabin
the
officials
were
no
sooner
seated
than
glancing
hastily
round
the
place
they
commenced
the
following
dialogue
from
what
port
captain

the
captain
had
a
peculiar
language
of
his
own
from
which
he
commonly
expunged
all
the
connecting

as

strangers
the
scotchman
just
glanced
over
the
documents
and
laid
them
on
the
table
had
you
a
good
passage
out
tedious
baffling
winds
heavy
fogs
detained
three
weeks
on
banks
foul
weather
making
gulf
short
of
water
people
out
of
provisions
steerage
passengers
any
case
of
sickness
or
death
on
board
all
sound
as
any
births
lisped
the
little
frenchman
the
captain
screwed
up
his
mouth
and
after
a
moment
reflection
he
replied
births
why
yes
now
i
think
o
gentlemen
we
had
one
female
on
board
who
produced
three
at
a
that
uncommon
said
the
scotch
doctor
with
an
air
of
lively
curiosity
are
the
children
alive
and
well
i
should
like
much
to
see
he
started
up
and
knocked
his
head
for
he
was
very
tall
against
the
ceiling
confound
your
low
cribs
i
have
nearly
dashed
out
my
a
hard
task
that
looked
the
captain
to
me
he
did
not
speak
but
i
knew
by
his
sarcastic
grin
what
was
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
the
young
ones
all
males
fine
thriving
fellows
step
upon
deck
sam
frazer
turning
to
his
steward
bring
them
down
for
doctors
to
sam
vanished
with
a
knowing
wink
to
his
superior
and
quickly
returned
bearing
in
his
arms
three
fat
the
sagacious
mother
following
close
at
his
heels
and
looked
ready
to
give
and
take
offence
on
the
slightest
provocation
here
gentlemen
are
the
babies
said
frazer
depositing
his
burden
on
the
floor
they
do
credit
to
the
nursing
of
the
brindled
the
old
tar
laughed
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
in
an
ecstacy
of
delight
at
the
indignation
and
disappointment
visible
in
the
countenance
of
the
scotch
esculapius
who
angry
as
he
was
wisely
held
his
tongue
not
so
the
frenchman
his
rage
scarcely
knew
bounds
he
danced
in
a
state
of
most
ludicrous
excitement
he
shook
his
fist
at
our
rough
captain
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
sacre
you
bete
you
tink
us
dog
ven
you
try
to
pass
your
puppies
on
us
for
babies
hout
man
do
be
angry
said
the
scotchman
stifling
a
laugh
you
see
is
only
a
joke
joke
me
no
understand
such
joke
bete
returned
the
angry
frenchman
bestowing
a
savage
kick
on
one
of
the
unoffending
pups
which
was
frisking
about
his
feet
the
pup
yelped
the
slut
barked
and
leaped
furiously
at
the
offender
and
was
only
kept
from
biting
him
by
sam
who
could
scarcely
hold
her
back
for
laughing
the
captain
was
uproarious
the
offended
frenchman
alone
maintained
a
severe
and
dignified
aspect
the
dogs
were
at
length
dismissed
and
peace
restored
after
some
further
questioning
from
the
officials
a
bible
was
required
for
the
captain
to
take
an
oath
mine
was
mislaid
and
there
was
none
at
hand
confound
it
muttered
the
old
sailor
tossing
over
the
papers
in
his
desk
that
scoundrel
sam
always
stows
my
traps
out
of
the
then
taking
up
from
the
table
a
book
which
i
had
been
reading
which
happened
to
be
voltaire
history
of
charles
he
presented
it
with
as
grave
an
air
as
he
could
assume
to
the
frenchman
taking
for
granted
that
it
was
the
volume
required
the
little
doctor
was
too
polite
to
open
the
book
the
captain
was
duly
sworn
and
the
party
returned
to
the
deck
here
a
new
difficulty
occurred
which
nearly
ended
in
a
serious
quarrel
the
gentlemen
requested
the
old
sailor
to
give
them
a
few
feet
of
old
planking
to
repair
some
damage
which
their
boat
had
sustained
the
day
before
this
the
captain
could
not
do
they
seemed
to
think
his
refusal
intentional
and
took
it
as
a
personal
affront
in
no
very
gentle
tones
they
ordered
him
instantly
to
prepare
his
boats
and
put
his
passengers
on
shore
stiff
breeze
short
sea
returned
the
bluff
old
seaman
great
risk
in
making
land
boats
heavily
laden
with
women
and
children
will
be
swamped
not
a
soul
goes
on
shore
this
if
you
refuse
to
comply
with
our
orders
we
will
report
you
to
the
i
know
my
duty
you
stick
to
yours
when
the
wind
falls
off
see
to
it
not
a
life
shall
be
risked
to
please
you
or
your
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
the
medical
men
left
the
vessel
in
great
disdain
we
had
every
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
firmness
displayed
by
our
rough
commander
that
same
evening
we
saw
eleven
persons
drowned
from
another
vessel
close
beside
us
while
attempting
to
make
the
shore
by
daybreak
all
was
hurry
and
confusion
on
board
the
anne
i
watched
boat
after
boat
depart
for
the
island
full
of
people
and
goods
and
envied
them
the
glorious
privilege
of
once
more
standing
firmly
on
the
earth
after
two
long
months
of
rocking
and
rolling
at
sea
how
ardently
we
anticipate
pleasure
which
often
ends
in
positive
pain
such
was
my
case
when
at
last
indulged
in
the
gratification
so
eagerly
desired
as
cabin
passengers
we
were
not
included
in
the
general
order
of
purification
but
were
only
obliged
to
send
our
servant
with
the
clothes
and
bedding
we
had
used
during
the
voyage
on
shore
to
be
washed
the
ship
was
soon
emptied
of
all
her
live
cargo
my
husband
went
off
with
the
boats
to
reconnoitre
the
island
and
i
was
left
alone
with
my
baby
in
the
otherwise
empty
vessel
even
oscar
the
captain
scotch
terrier
who
had
formed
a
devoted
attachment
to
me
during
the
voyage
forgot
his
allegiance
became
possessed
of
the
land
mania
and
was
away
with
the
rest
with
the
most
intense
desire
to
go
on
shore
i
was
doomed
to
look
and
long
and
envy
every
boatful
of
emigrants
that
glided
past
nor
was
this
all
the
ship
was
out
of
provisions
and
i
was
condemned
to
undergo
a
rigid
fast
until
the
return
of
the
boat
when
the
captain
had
promised
a
supply
of
fresh
butter
and
bread
the
vessel
had
been
nine
weeks
at
sea
the
poor
steerage
passengers
for
the
two
last
weeks
had
been
out
of
food
and
the
captain
had
been
obliged
to
feed
them
from
the
ship
stores
the
promised
bread
was
to
be
obtained
from
a
small
which
plied
daily
between
quebec
and
the
island
transporting
convalescent
emigrants
and
their
goods
in
her
upward
trip
and
provisions
for
the
sick
on
her
return
how
i
reckoned
on
once
more
tasting
bread
and
butter
the
very
thought
of
the
treat
in
store
served
to
sharpen
my
appetite
and
render
the
long
fast
more
irksome
i
could
now
fully
realise
all
bowdich
longings
for
english
bread
and
butter
after
her
three
years
travel
through
the
burning
african
deserts
with
her
talented
husband
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
at
plymouth
said
she
and
were
asked
what
refreshment
we
chose
and
bread
and
butter
was
my
instant
reply
bread
if
you
please
and
plenty
of
it
i
never
enjoyed
any
luxury
like
it
i
was
positively
ashamed
of
asking
the
waiter
to
refill
the
plate
after
the
execrable
messes
and
the
hard
imagine
the
luxury
of
a
good
slice
of
english
bread
and
butter
at
home
i
laughed
heartily
at
the
lively
energy
with
which
that
charming
woman
of
genius
related
this
little
incident
in
her
eventful
history
but
off
grosse
isle
i
realised
it
all
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
horizon
all
these
circumstances
were
gradually
forgotten
and
merged
in
the
surpassing
grandeur
of
the
scene
that
rose
majestically
before
me
the
previous
day
had
been
dark
and
stormy
and
a
heavy
fog
had
concealed
the
mountain
chain
which
forms
the
stupendous
background
to
this
sublime
view
entirely
from
our
sight
as
the
clouds
rolled
away
from
their
grey
bald
brows
and
cast
into
denser
shadow
the
vast
forest
belt
that
girdled
them
round
they
loomed
out
like
mighty
giants
titans
of
the
earth
in
all
their
rugged
and
awful
beauty
a
thrill
of
wonder
and
delight
pervaded
my
mind
the
spectacle
floated
dimly
on
my
sight
my
eyes
were
blinded
with
tears
blinded
with
the
excess
of
beauty
i
turned
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
i
looked
up
and
down
the
glorious
river
never
had
i
beheld
so
many
striking
objects
blended
into
one
mighty
whole
nature
had
lavished
all
her
noblest
features
in
producing
that
enchanting
scene
the
rocky
isle
in
front
with
its
neat
at
the
eastern
point
and
its
high
bluff
at
the
western
extremity
crowned
with
the
telegraph
the
middle
space
occupied
by
tents
and
sheds
for
the
cholera
patients
and
its
wooded
shores
dotted
over
with
motley
groups
added
greatly
to
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
land
scene
then
the
broad
glittering
river
covered
with
boats
darting
to
and
fro
conveying
passengers
from
vessels
of
various
size
and
tonnage
which
rode
at
anchor
with
their
flags
flying
from
the
gave
an
air
of
life
and
interest
to
the
whole
turning
to
the
south
side
of
the
lawrence
i
was
not
less
struck
with
its
low
fertile
shores
white
houses
and
neat
churches
whose
slender
spires
and
bright
tin
roofs
shone
like
silver
as
they
caught
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
a
line
of
white
buildings
extended
along
the
bank
their
background
formed
by
the
purple
hue
of
the
dense
interminable
forest
it
was
a
scene
unlike
any
i
had
ever
beheld
and
to
which
britain
contains
no
parallel
mackenzie
an
old
scotch
dragoon
who
was
one
of
our
passengers
when
he
rose
in
the
morning
and
saw
the
parish
of
thomas
for
the
first
time
exclaimed
weel
it
beats
a
can
thae
white
clouts
be
a
houses
they
look
like
claes
hung
out
to
drie
there
was
some
truth
in
this
odd
comparison
and
for
some
minutes
i
could
scarcely
convince
myself
that
the
white
patches
scattered
so
thickly
over
the
opposite
shore
could
be
the
dwellings
of
a
busy
lively
population
what
sublime
views
of
the
north
side
of
the
river
those
habitans
of
thomas
must
enjoy
thought
i
perhaps
familiarity
with
the
scene
has
rendered
them
indifferent
to
its
astonishing
beauty
eastward
the
view
down
the
lawrence
towards
the
gulf
is
the
finest
of
all
scarcely
surpassed
by
anything
in
the
world
your
eye
follows
the
long
range
of
lofty
mountains
until
their
blue
summits
are
blended
and
lost
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
some
of
these
partially
cleared
round
the
base
are
sprinkled
over
with
neat
cottages
and
the
green
slopes
that
spread
around
them
are
covered
with
flocks
and
herds
the
surface
of
the
splendid
river
is
diversified
with
islands
of
every
size
and
shape
some
in
wood
others
partially
cleared
and
adorned
with
orchards
and
white
as
the
early
sun
streamed
upon
the
most
prominent
of
these
leaving
the
others
in
deep
shade
the
effect
was
strangely
novel
and
imposing
in
more
remote
regions
where
the
forest
has
never
yet
echoed
to
the
woodman
axe
or
received
the
impress
of
civilisation
the
first
approach
to
the
shore
inspires
a
melancholy
awe
which
becomes
painful
in
its
intensity
land
of
vast
hills
and
mighty
streams
the
lofty
sun
that
thee
beams
on
fairer
clime
sheds
not
his
ray
when
basking
in
the
noon
of
day
thy
waters
dance
in
silver
light
and
them
frowning
dark
as
night
thy
shadowy
forests
soaring
high
stretch
forth
beyond
the
aching
eye
and
blend
in
distance
with
the
sky
and
silence
awful
silence
broods
profoundly
these
solitudes
nought
but
the
lapsing
of
the
floods
breaks
the
deep
stillness
of
the
woods
a
sense
of
desolation
reigns
these
unpeopled
forest
plains
where
sounds
of
life
wake
a
tone
of
cheerful
praise
round
nature
throne
man
finds
himself
with
god
alone
my
daydreams
were
dispelled
by
the
return
of
the
boat
which
brought
my
husband
and
the
captain
from
the
island
no
bread
said
the
latter
shaking
his
head
you
must
be
content
to
starve
a
little
longer
not
in
till
four
my
husband
smiled
at
the
look
of
blank
disappointment
with
which
i
received
these
unwelcome
tidings
never
mind
i
have
news
which
will
comfort
you
the
officer
who
commands
the
station
sent
a
note
to
me
by
an
orderly
inviting
us
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
him
he
promises
to
show
us
everything
worthy
of
notice
on
the
island
captain
claims
acquaintance
with
me
but
i
have
not
the
least
recollection
of
him
would
you
like
to
go
oh
by
all
means
i
long
to
see
the
lovely
island
it
looks
a
perfect
paradise
at
this
the
rough
screwed
his
mouth
on
one
side
and
gave
me
one
of
his
comical
looks
but
he
said
nothing
until
he
assisted
in
placing
me
and
the
baby
in
the
boat
do
be
too
sanguine
moodie
many
things
look
well
at
a
distance
which
are
bad
enough
when
i
scarcely
regarded
the
old
sailor
warning
so
eager
was
i
to
go
on
shore
to
put
my
foot
upon
the
soil
of
the
new
world
for
the
first
time
i
was
in
no
humour
to
listen
to
any
depreciation
of
what
seemed
so
beautiful
it
was
four
when
we
landed
on
the
rocks
which
the
rays
of
an
intensely
scorching
sun
had
rendered
so
hot
that
i
could
scarcely
place
my
foot
upon
them
how
the
people
without
shoes
bore
it
i
can
not
imagine
never
shall
i
forget
the
extraordinary
spectacle
that
met
our
sight
the
moment
we
passed
the
low
range
of
bushes
which
formed
a
screen
in
front
of
the
river
a
crowd
of
many
hundred
irish
emigrants
had
been
landed
during
the
present
and
former
day
and
all
this
motley
crew
men
women
and
children
who
were
not
confined
by
sickness
to
the
sheds
which
greatly
resembled
were
employed
in
washing
clothes
or
spreading
them
out
on
the
rocks
and
bushes
to
dry
the
men
and
boys
were
in
the
water
while
the
women
with
their
scanty
garments
tucked
above
their
knees
were
trampling
their
bedding
in
tubs
or
in
holes
in
the
rocks
which
the
retiring
tide
had
left
half
full
of
water
those
who
did
not
possess
pails
or
iron
pots
or
could
not
obtain
access
to
a
hole
in
the
rocks
were
running
to
and
fro
screaming
and
scolding
in
no
measured
terms
the
confusion
of
babel
was
among
them
all
talkers
and
no
hearers
each
shouting
and
yelling
in
his
or
her
uncouth
dialect
and
all
accompanying
their
vociferations
with
violent
and
extraordinary
gestures
quite
incomprehensible
to
the
uninitiated
we
were
literally
stunned
by
the
strife
of
tongues
i
shrank
with
feelings
almost
akin
to
fear
from
the
harpies
as
they
elbowed
rudely
past
me
i
had
heard
and
read
much
of
savages
and
have
since
seen
during
my
long
residence
in
the
bush
somewhat
of
uncivilised
life
but
the
indian
is
one
of
nature
gentlemen
he
never
says
or
does
a
rude
or
vulgar
thing
the
vicious
uneducated
barbarians
who
form
the
surplus
of
european
countries
are
far
behind
the
wild
man
in
delicacy
of
feeling
or
natural
courtesy
the
people
who
covered
the
island
appeared
perfectly
destitute
of
shame
or
even
of
a
sense
of
common
decency
many
were
almost
naked
still
more
but
partially
clothed
we
turned
in
disgust
from
the
revolting
scene
but
were
unable
to
leave
the
spot
until
the
captain
had
satisfied
a
noisy
group
of
his
own
people
who
were
demanding
a
supply
of
stores
and
here
i
must
observe
that
our
passengers
who
were
chiefly
honest
scotch
labourers
and
mechanics
from
the
vicinity
of
edinburgh
and
who
while
on
board
ship
had
conducted
themselves
with
the
greatest
propriety
and
appeared
the
most
quiet
orderly
set
of
people
in
the
world
no
sooner
set
foot
upon
the
island
than
they
became
infected
by
the
same
spirit
of
insubordination
and
misrule
and
were
just
as
insolent
and
noisy
as
the
rest
while
our
captain
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
satisfy
the
unreasonable
demands
of
his
rebellious
people
moodie
had
discovered
a
woodland
path
that
led
to
the
back
of
the
island
sheltered
by
some
from
the
intense
heat
of
the
sun
we
sat
down
by
the
cool
gushing
river
out
of
sight
but
alas
not
out
of
hearing
of
the
noisy
riotous
crowd
could
we
have
shut
out
the
profane
sounds
which
came
to
us
on
every
breeze
how
deeply
should
we
have
enjoyed
an
hour
amid
the
tranquil
beauties
of
that
retired
and
lovely
spot
the
rocky
banks
of
the
island
were
adorned
with
beautiful
evergreens
which
sprang
up
spontaneously
in
every
nook
and
crevice
i
remarked
many
of
our
favourite
garden
shrubs
among
these
wildings
of
nature
the
fillagree
with
its
narrow
dark
leaves
the
privet
with
its
modest
white
blossoms
and
purple
berries
the
with
its
strong
resinous
odour
the
and
a
great
variety
of
elegant
unknowns
here
the
shores
of
the
island
and
mainland
receding
from
each
other
formed
a
small
cove
overhung
with
lofty
trees
clothed
from
the
base
to
the
summit
with
wild
vines
that
hung
in
graceful
festoons
from
the
topmost
branches
to
the
water
edge
the
dark
shadows
of
the
mountains
thrown
upon
the
water
as
they
towered
to
the
height
of
some
thousand
feet
above
us
gave
to
the
surface
of
the
river
an
ebon
hue
the
sunbeams
dancing
through
the
thick
quivering
foliage
fell
in
stars
of
gold
or
long
lines
of
dazzling
brightness
upon
the
deep
black
waters
producing
the
most
novel
and
beautiful
effects
it
was
a
scene
over
which
the
spirit
of
peace
might
brood
in
silent
adoration
but
how
spoiled
by
the
discordant
yells
of
the
filthy
beings
who
were
sullying
the
purity
of
the
air
and
water
with
contaminating
sights
and
sounds
we
were
now
joined
by
the
sergeant
who
very
kindly
brought
us
his
capful
of
ripe
plums
and
the
growth
of
the
island
a
joyful
present
but
marred
by
a
note
from
captain
who
had
found
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
his
supposed
knowledge
of
us
and
politely
apologised
for
not
being
allowed
by
the
to
receive
any
emigrant
beyond
the
bounds
appointed
for
the
performance
of
quarantine
i
was
deeply
disappointed
but
my
husband
laughingly
told
me
that
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
island
and
turning
to
the
soldier
remarked
that
it
could
be
no
easy
task
to
keep
such
wild
savages
in
you
may
well
say
that
sir
but
our
night
scenes
far
exceed
those
of
the
day
you
would
think
they
were
incarnate
devils
singing
drinking
dancing
shouting
and
cutting
antics
that
would
surprise
the
leader
of
a
circus
they
have
no
shame
are
under
no
restraint
nobody
knows
them
here
and
they
think
they
can
speak
and
act
as
they
please
and
they
are
such
thieves
that
they
rob
one
another
of
the
little
they
possess
the
healthy
actually
run
the
risk
of
taking
the
cholera
by
robbing
the
sick
if
you
have
not
hired
one
or
two
stout
honest
fellows
from
among
your
fellow
passengers
to
guard
your
clothes
while
they
are
drying
you
will
never
see
half
of
them
again
they
are
a
sad
set
sir
a
sad
set
we
could
perhaps
manage
the
men
but
the
women
sir
the
women
oh
sir
anxious
as
we
were
to
return
to
the
ship
we
were
obliged
to
remain
until
in
our
retired
nook
we
were
hungry
tired
and
out
of
spirits
the
mosquitoes
swarmed
in
myriads
around
us
tormenting
the
poor
baby
who
not
at
all
pleased
with
her
first
visit
to
the
new
world
filled
the
air
with
cries
when
the
captain
came
to
tell
us
that
the
boat
was
ready
it
was
a
welcome
sound
forcing
our
way
once
more
through
the
still
squabbling
crowd
we
gained
the
landing
place
here
we
encountered
a
boat
just
landing
a
fresh
cargo
of
lively
savages
from
the
emerald
isle
one
fellow
of
gigantic
proportions
whose
long
tattered
just
reached
below
the
middle
of
his
bare
red
legs
and
like
charity
hid
the
defects
of
his
other
garments
or
perhaps
concealed
his
want
of
them
leaped
upon
the
rocks
and
flourishing
aloft
his
shilelagh
bounded
and
capered
like
a
wild
goat
from
his
native
mountains
whurrah
my
boys
he
cried
shure
we
all
be
jintlemen
pull
away
my
lads
said
the
captain
then
turning
to
me
well
moodie
i
hope
that
you
have
had
enough
of
grosse
isle
but
could
you
have
witnessed
the
scenes
that
i
did
this
morning
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
wife
of
the
old
scotch
dragoon
mackenzie
running
down
to
the
boat
and
laying
her
hand
familiarly
upon
his
shoulder
captain
dinna
forget
what
she
whispered
something
confidentially
in
his
ear
oh
ho
the
brandy
he
responded
aloud
i
should
have
thought
mackenzie
that
you
had
had
enough
of
that
same
on
yon
island
aye
sic
a
place
for
decent
folk
returned
the
drunken
body
shaking
her
head
one
needs
a
drap
o
comfort
captain
to
keep
up
one
heart
the
captain
set
up
one
of
his
boisterous
laughs
as
he
pushed
the
boat
from
the
shore
hollo
sam
frazer
steer
in
we
have
forgotten
the
i
hope

captain
said
i
i
have
been
starving
since

butter
the
beef

onions
and
potatoes

said
honest
sam
particularizing
each
article
all
right
pull
for
the
ship
moodie
we
will
have
a
glorious
supper
and
mind
you
do
dream
of
grosse
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
again
on
board
thus
ended
my
first
experience
of
the
land
of
all
our
hopes
oh
can
you
leave
your
native
land
a
canadian
song
oh
can
you
leave
your
native
land
an
exile
bride
to
be
your
mother
home
and
cheerful
hearth
to
tempt
the
main
with
me
across
the
wide
and
stormy
sea
to
trace
our
foaming
track
and
know
the
wave
that
heaves
us
on
will
never
bear
us
back
and
can
you
in
canadian
woods
with
me
the
harvest
bind
nor
feel
one
lingering
sad
regret
for
all
you
leave
behind
can
those
dear
hands
unused
to
toil
the
woodman
wants
supply
nor
shrink
beneath
the
chilly
blast
when
wintry
storms
are
nigh
amid
the
shades
of
forests
dark
our
loved
isle
will
appear
an
eden
whose
delicious
bloom
will
make
the
wild
more
drear
and
you
in
solitude
will
weep
scenes
beloved
in
vain
and
pine
away
your
life
to
view
once
more
your
native
plain
then
pause
dear
girl
ere
those
fond
lips
your
wanderer
fate
decide
my
spirit
spurns
the
selfish
wish
you
must
not
be
my
bride
but
oh
that
smile
those
tearful
eyes
my
firmer
purpose
move
our
hearts
are
one
and
we
will
dare
all
perils
thus
to
love
this
song
has
been
set
to
a
beautiful
plaintive
air
by
my
husband
chapter
ii
quebec
queen
of
the
west
upon
thy
rocky
throne
in
solitary
grandeur
sternly
placed
in
awful
majesty
thou
alone
by
nature
supremely
graced
the
world
has
not
thy
counterpart
thy
dower
eternal
beauty
strength
and
matchless
power
the
clouds
enfold
thee
in
their
misty
vest
the
lightning
glances
harmless
round
thy
brow
the
thunder
can
not
shake
thy
nest
or
warring
waves
that
idly
chafe
below
the
storm
above
the
waters
at
thy
feet
may
rage
and
foam
they
but
secure
thy
seat
the
mighty
river
as
it
onward
rushes
to
pour
its
floods
in
ocean
dread
abyss
checks
at
thy
feet
its
fierce
impetuous
gushes
and
gently
fawns
thy
rocky
base
to
kiss
stern
eagle
of
the
crag
thy
hold
should
be
the
mountain
home
of
liberty
true
to
themselves
thy
children
may
defy
the
power
and
malice
of
a
world
combined
while
britain
flag
beneath
thy
deep
blue
sky
spreads
its
rich
folds
and
wantons
in
the
wind
the
offspring
of
her
glorious
race
of
old
may
rest
securely
in
their
mountain
hold
on
the
of
september
the
anchor
was
weighed
and
we
bade
a
long
farewell
to
grosse
isle
as
our
vessel
struck
into
i
cast
a
last
lingering
look
at
the
beautiful
shores
we
were
leaving
cradled
in
the
arms
of
the
lawrence
and
basking
in
the
bright
rays
of
the
morning
sun
the
island
and
its
sister
group
looked
like
a
second
eden
just
emerged
from
the
waters
of
chaos
with
what
joy
could
i
have
spent
the
rest
of
the
fall
in
exploring
the
romantic
features
of
that
enchanting
scene
but
our
bark
spread
her
white
wings
to
the
favouring
breeze
and
the
fairy
vision
gradually
receded
from
my
sight
to
remain
for
ever
on
the
tablets
of
memory
the
day
was
warm
and
the
cloudless
heavens
of
that
peculiar
azure
tint
which
gives
to
the
canadian
skies
and
waters
a
brilliancy
unknown
in
more
northern
latitudes
the
air
was
pure
and
elastic
the
sun
shone
out
with
uncommon
splendour
lighting
up
the
changing
woods
with
a
rich
mellow
colouring
composed
of
a
thousand
brilliant
and
vivid
dyes
the
mighty
river
rolled
flashing
and
sparkling
onward
impelled
by
a
strong
breeze
that
tipped
its
short
rolling
surges
with
a
crest
of
snowy
foam
had
there
been
no
other
object
of
interest
in
the
landscape
than
this
majestic
river
its
vast
magnitude
and
the
depth
and
clearness
of
its
waters
and
its
great
importance
to
the
colony
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
riveted
the
attention
and
claimed
the
admiration
of
every
thinking
mind
never
shall
i
forget
that
short
voyage
from
grosse
isle
to
quebec
i
love
to
recall
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
every
object
that
awoke
in
my
breast
emotions
of
astonishment
and
delight
what
wonderful
combinations
of
beauty
and
grandeur
and
power
at
every
winding
of
that
noble
river
how
the
mind
expands
with
the
sublimity
of
the
spectacle
and
soars
upward
in
gratitude
and
adoration
to
the
author
of
all
being
to
thank
him
for
having
made
this
lower
world
so
wondrously
fair
a
living
temple
and
capable
of
receiving
the
homage
of
all
worshippers
every
perception
of
my
mind
became
absorbed
into
the
one
sense
of
seeing
when
upon
rounding
point
levi
we
cast
anchor
before
quebec
what
a
scene
can
the
world
produce
such
another
edinburgh
had
been
the
beau
ideal
to
me
of
all
that
was
beautiful
in
nature
a
vision
of
the
northern
highlands
had
haunted
my
dreams
across
the
atlantic
but
all
these
past
recollections
faded
before
the
present
of
quebec
nature
has
lavished
all
her
grandest
elements
to
form
this
astonishing
panorama
there
frowns
the
mountain
and
below
the
cataract
foams
and
thunders
wood
and
rock
and
river
combine
to
lend
their
aid
in
making
the
picture
perfect
and
worthy
of
its
divine
originator
the
precipitous
bank
upon
which
the
city
lies
piled
reflected
in
the
still
deep
waters
at
its
base
greatly
enhances
the
romantic
beauty
of
the
situation
the
mellow
and
serene
glow
of
the
autumnal
day
harmonised
so
perfectly
with
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
scene
around
me
and
sank
so
silently
and
deeply
into
my
soul
that
my
spirit
fell
prostrate
before
it
and
i
melted
involuntarily
into
tears
yes
regardless
of
the
eager
crowds
around
me
i
leant
upon
the
side
of
the
vessel
and
cried
like
a
child
not
tears
of
sorrow
but
a
gush
from
the
heart
of
pure
and
unalloyed
delight
i
heard
not
the
many
voices
murmuring
in
my
ears
i
saw
not
the
anxious
beings
that
thronged
our
narrow
deck
my
soul
at
that
moment
was
alone
with
god
the
shadow
of
his
glory
rested
visibly
on
the
stupendous
objects
that
composed
that
magnificent
scene
words
are
perfectly
inadequate
to
describe
the
impression
it
made
upon
my
mind
the
emotions
it
produced
the
only
homage
i
was
capable
of
offering
at
such
a
shrine
was
tears
tears
the
most
heartfelt
and
sincere
that
ever
flowed
from
human
eyes
i
never
before
felt
so
overpoweringly
my
own
insignificance
and
the
boundless
might
and
majesty
of
the
eternal
canadians
rejoice
in
your
beautiful
city
rejoice
and
be
worthy
of
her
for
few
very
few
of
the
sons
of
men
can
point
to
such
a
spot
as
quebec
and
exclaim
she
is
ours
god
gave
her
to
us
in
her
beauty
and
strength
we
will
live
for
her
glory
we
will
die
to
defend
her
liberty
and
rights
to
raise
her
majestic
brow
high
above
the
nations
look
at
the
situation
of
quebec
the
city
founded
on
the
rock
that
proudly
holds
the
height
of
the
hill
the
queen
sitting
enthroned
above
the
waters
that
curb
their
swiftness
and
their
strength
to
kiss
and
fawn
around
her
lovely
feet
canadians
as
long
as
you
remain
true
to
yourselves
and
her
what
foreign
invader
could
ever
dare
to
plant
a
hostile
flag
upon
that
height
or
set
his
foot
upon
a
fortress
rendered
impregnable
by
the
hand
of
nature
united
in
friendship
loyalty
and
love
what
wonders
may
you
not
achieve
to
what
an
enormous
altitude
of
wealth
and
importance
may
you
not
arrive
look
at
the
lawrence
that
king
of
streams
that
great
artery
flowing
from
the
heart
of
the
world
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
carrying
wealth
and
fertility
in
its
course
and
transporting
from
town
to
town
along
its
beautiful
shores
the
riches
and
produce
of
a
thousand
distant
climes
what
elements
of
future
greatness
and
prosperity
encircle
you
on
every
side
never
yield
up
these
solid
advantages
to
become
an
humble
dependent
on
the
great
republic
wait
patiently
loyally
lovingly
upon
the
illustrious
parent
from
whom
you
sprang
and
by
whom
you
have
been
fostered
into
life
and
political
importance
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
will
proclaim
your
childhood
past
and
bid
you
stand
up
in
your
own
strength
a
free
canadian
people
british
mothers
of
canadian
sons
learn
to
feel
for
their
country
the
same
enthusiasm
which
fills
your
hearts
when
thinking
of
the
glory
of
your
own
teach
them
to
love
canada
to
look
upon
her
as
the
first
the
happiest
the
most
independent
country
in
the
world
exhort
them
to
be
worthy
of
her
to
have
faith
in
her
present
prosperity
in
her
future
greatness
and
to
devote
all
their
talents
when
they
themselves
are
men
to
accomplish
this
noble
object
make
your
children
proud
of
the
land
of
their
birth
the
land
which
has
given
them
bread
the
land
in
which
you
have
found
an
altar
and
a
home
do
this
and
you
will
soon
cease
to
lament
your
separation
from
the
mother
country
and
the
loss
of
those
luxuries
which
you
could
not
in
honor
to
yourself
enjoy
you
will
soon
learn
to
love
canada
as
i
now
love
it
who
once
viewed
it
with
a
hatred
so
intense
that
i
longed
to
die
that
death
might
effectually
separate
us
for
ever
but
oh
beware
of
drawing
disparaging
contrasts
between
the
colony
and
its
illustrious
parent
all
such
comparisons
are
cruel
and
unjust
you
can
not
exalt
the
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
without
committing
an
act
of
treason
against
both
but
i
have
wandered
away
from
my
subject
into
the
regions
of
thought
and
must
again
descend
to
common
realities
the
pleasure
we
experienced
upon
our
first
glance
at
quebec
was
greatly
damped
by
the
sad
conviction
that
the
raged
within
her
walls
while
the
almost
ceaseless
tolling
of
bells
proclaimed
a
mournful
tale
of
woe
and
death
scarcely
a
person
visited
the
vessel
who
was
not
in
black
or
who
spoke
not
in
tones
of
subdued
grief
they
advised
us
not
to
go
on
shore
if
we
valued
our
lives
as
strangers
most
commonly
fell
the
first
victims
to
the
fatal
malady
this
was
to
me
a
severe
disappointment
who
felt
an
intense
desire
to
climb
to
the
crown
of
the
rock
and
survey
the
noble
landscape
at
my
feet
i
yielded
at
last
to
the
wishes
of
my
husband
who
did
not
himself
resist
the
temptation
in
his
own
person
and
endeavored
to
content
myself
with
the
means
of
enjoyment
placed
within
my
reach
my
eyes
were
never
tired
of
wandering
over
the
scene
before
me
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
differently
the
objects
which
call
forth
intense
admiration
in
some
minds
will
affect
others
the
scotch
dragoon
mackenzie
seeing
me
look
long
and
intently
at
the
distant
falls
of

here
said

and
ye
maun
wait
a
muckle
time
before
they
wad
think
aucht
of
you
at
i
was
not
a
little
amused
at
the
extravagant
expectations
entertained
by
some
of
our
steerage
passengers
the
sight
of
the
canadian
shores
had
changed
them
into
persons
of
great
consequence
the
poorest
and
the
the
and
the
most
repulsive
in
mind
and
morals
exhibited
most
disgusting
traits
of
vanity
and
presumption
seemed
to
possess
them
altogether
they
talked
loudly
of
the
rank
and
wealth
of
their
connexions
at
home
and
lamented
the
great
sacrifices
they
had
made
in
order
to
join
brothers
and
cousins
who
had
foolishly
settled
in
this
beggarly
wooden
country
girls
who
were
scarcely
able
to
wash
a
floor
decently
talked
of
service
with
contempt
unless
tempted
to
change
their
resolution
by
the
offer
of
twelve
dollars
a
month
to
endeavour
to
undeceive
them
was
a
useless
and
ungracious
task
after
having
tried
it
with
several
without
success
i
left
it
to
time
and
bitter
experience
to
restore
them
to
their
sober
senses
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
the
captain
and
the
dread
of
the
cholera
they
all
rushed
on
shore
to
inspect
the
land
of
goshen
and
to
endeavour
to
realise
their
absurd
anticipations
we
were
favoured
a
few
minutes
after
our
arrival
with
another
visit
from
the
but
in
this
instance
both
the
gentlemen
were
canadians
grave
men
who
talked
much
and
ominously
of
the
prevailing
disorder
and
the
impossibility
of
strangers
escaping
from
its
fearful
ravages
this
was
not
very
consoling
and
served
to
depress
the
cheerful
tone
of
mind
which
after
all
is
one
of
the
best
antidotes
against
this
awful
scourge
the
cabin
seemed
to
lighten
and
the
air
to
circulate
more
freely
after
the
departure
of
these
professional
ravens
the
captain
as
if
by
instinct
took
an
additional
glass
of
grog
to
shake
off
the
sepulchral
gloom
their
presence
had
inspired
the
visit
of
the
doctors
was
followed
by
that
of
two
of
the
officials
of
the
customs
vulgar
illiterate
men
who
seating
themselves
at
the
cabin
table
with
a
familiar
nod
to
the
captain
and
a
blank
stare
at
us
commenced
the
following
dialogue
officer
after
making
inquiries
as
to
the
general
cargo
of
the
vessel

good

board

what
else
officer
we
will
now
proceed
to
my
readers
would
have
laughed
as
i
did
could
they
have
seen
how
doggedly
the
old
man
shook
his
fist
after
these
worthies
as
they
left
the
vessel
scoundrels
he
muttered
to
himself
and
then
turning
to
me
they
rob
us
in
this
barefaced
manner
and
we
dare
not
resist
or
complain
for
fear
of
the
trouble
they
can
put
us
to
if
i
had
those
villains
at
sea
i
give
them
a
taste
of
brandy
and
ale
that
they
would
not
the
day
wore
away
and
the
lengthened
shadows
of
the
mountains
fell
upon
the
waters
when
the
horsley
hill
a
large
vessel
from
waterford
that
we
had
left
at
the
quarantine
station
cast
anchor
a
little
above
us
she
was
quickly
boarded
by
the
and
ordered
round
to
take
up
her
station
below
the
castle
to
accomplish
this
object
she
had
to
heave
her
anchor
when
lo
a
great
which
had
been
sunk
in
the
river
became
entangled
in
the
chains
uproarious
was
the
mirth
to
which
the
incident
gave
rise
among
the
crowds
that
thronged
the
decks
of
the
many
vessels
then
at
anchor
in
the
river
resounded
on
every
side
and
my
readers
may
be
assured
that
the
was
not
forgotten
in
the
multitude
of
jokes
which
followed
laughter
resounded
on
all
sides
and
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
confusion
the
captain
of
the
horsley
hill
hoisted
his
colours
downwards
as
if
making
signals
of
distress
a
mistake
which
provoked
renewed
and
mirth
i
laughed
until
my
sides
ached
little
thinking
how
the
horsley
hill
would
pay
us
off
for
our
mistimed
hilarity
towards
night
most
of
the
steerage
passengers
returned
greatly
dissatisfied
with
their
first
visit
to
the
city
which
they
declared
to
be
a
filthy
hole
that
looked
a
great
deal
better
from
the
ship
side
than
it
did
on
shore
this
i
have
often
been
told
is
literally
the
case
here
as
elsewhere
man
has
marred
the
magnificent
creation
of
his
maker
a
dark
and
starless
night
closed
in
accompanied
by
cold
winds
and
drizzling
rain
we
seemed
to
have
made
a
sudden
leap
from
the
torrid
to
the
frigid
zone
two
hours
before
my
light
summer
clothing
was
almost
insupportable
and
now
a
heavy
and
plaid
formed
but
an
inefficient
screen
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
after
watching
for
some
time
the
singular
effect
produced
by
the
lights
in
the
town
reflected
in
the
water
and
weary
with
a
long
day
of
anticipation
and
excitement
i
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
deck
and
retire
to
rest
i
had
just
settled
down
my
baby
in
her
berth
when
the
vessel
struck
with
a
sudden
crash
that
sent
a
shiver
through
her
whole
frame
alarmed
but
not
aware
of
the
real
danger
that
hung
over
us
i
groped
my
way
to
the
cabin
and
thence
ascended
to
the
deck
here
a
scene
of
confusion
prevailed
that
baffles
description
by
some
strange
fatality
the
horsley
hill
had
changed
her
position
and
run
foul
of
us
in
the
dark
the
anne
was
a
small
brig
and
her
unlucky
neighbour
a
heavy
vessel
with
three
hundred
irish
emigrants
on
board
and
as
her
bowspirit
was
directly
across
the
bows
of
the
anne
and
she
anchored
and
unable
to
free
herself
from
the
deadly
embrace
there
was
no
small
danger
of
the
poor
brig
going
down
in
the
unequal
struggle
unable
to
comprehend
what
was
going
on
i
raised
my
head
above
my
companion
ladder
just
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
vessels
were
grappled
together
the
shrieks
of
the
women
the
shouts
and
oaths
of
the
men
and
the
barking
of
the
dogs
in
either
ship
aided
the
dense
darkness
of
the
night
in
producing
a
most
awful
and
stunning
effect
what
is
the
matter
i
gasped
out
what
is
the
reason
of
this
dreadful
confusion
the
captain
was
raging
like
a
chafed
bull
in
the
grasp
of
several
frantic
women
who
were
clinging
shrieking
to
his
knees
with
great
difficulty
i
persuaded
the
women
to
accompany
me
below
the
mate
hurried
off
with
the
cabin
light
upon
the
deck
and
we
were
left
in
total
darkness
to
await
the
result
a
deep
strange
silence
fell
upon
my
heart
it
was
not
exactly
fear
but
a
sort
of
nerving
of
my
spirit
to
meet
the
worst
the
cowardly
behaviour
of
my
companions
inspired
me
with
courage
i
was
ashamed
of
their
pusillanimity
and
want
of
faith
in
the
divine
providence
i
sat
down
and
calmly
begged
them
to
follow
my
example
an
old
woman
called
williamson
a
sad
reprobate
in
attempting
to
do
so
set
her
foot
within
the
fender
which
the
captain
had
converted
into
a
repository
for
empty
glass
bottles
the
smash
that
ensued
was
echoed
by
a
shriek
from
the
whole
party
god
guide
us
cried
the
ancient
dame
but
we
are
going
into
eternity
i
shall
be
lost
my
sins
are
more
in
number
than
the
hairs
of
my
this
confession
was
followed
by
oaths
and
imprecations
too
blasphemous
to
repeat
shocked
and
disgusted
at
her
profanity
i
bade
her
pray
and
not
waste
the
few
moments
that
might
be
hers
in
using
oaths
and
bad
language
did
you
not
hear
the
crash
said
she
i
did
it
was
of
your
own
making
sit
down
and
be
here
followed
another
shock
that
made
the
vessel
heave
and
tremble
and
the
dragging
of
the
anchor
increased
the
uneasy
motion
which
began
to
fill
the
boldest
of
us
with
alarm
mrs
moodie
we
are
lost
said
margaret
williamson
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
old
woman
a
pretty
girl
who
had
been
the
belle
of
the
ship
flinging
herself
on
her
knees
before
me
and
grasping
both
my
hands
in
hers
oh
pray
for
me
pray
for
me
i
can
not
i
dare
not
pray
for
myself
i
was
never
taught
a
her
voice
was
choked
with
convulsive
sobs
and
scalding
tears
fell
in
torrents
from
her
eyes
over
my
hands
i
never
witnessed
such
an
agony
of
despair
before
i
could
say
one
word
to
comfort
her
another
shock
seemed
to
lift
the
vessel
upwards
i
felt
my
own
blood
run
cold
expecting
instantly
to
go
down
and
thoughts
of
death
and
the
unknown
eternity
at
our
feet
flitted
vaguely
through
my
mind
if
we
stay
here
we
shall
perish
cried
the
girl
springing
to
her
feet
let
us
go
on
deck
mother
and
take
our
chance
with
the
stay
i
said
you
are
safer
here
british
sailors
never
leave
women
to
perish
you
have
fathers
husbands
brothers
on
board
who
will
not
forget
you
i
beseech
you
to
remain
patiently
here
until
the
danger
is
i
might
as
well
have
preached
to
the
winds
the
headstrong
creatures
would
no
longer
be
controlled
they
rushed
simultaneously
upon
deck
just
as
the
horsley
hill
swung
off
carrying
with
her
part
of
the
outer
frame
of
our
deck
and
the
larger
portion
of
our
stern
when
tranquillity
was
restored
fatigued
both
in
mind
and
body
i
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
and
did
not
awake
until
the
sun
had
risen
high
above
the
fortress
of
quebec
the
stormy
clouds
had
all
dispersed
during
the
night
the
air
was
clear
and
balmy
the
giant
hills
were
robed
in
a
blue
soft
mist
which
rolled
around
them
in
fleecy
volumes
as
the
beams
of
the
sun
penetrated
their
shadowy
folds
they
gradually
drew
up
like
a
curtain
and
dissolved
like
wreaths
of
smoke
into
the
clear
air
the
moment
i
came
on
deck
my
old
friend
oscar
greeted
me
with
his
usual
joyous
bark
and
with
the
sagacity
peculiar
to
his
species
proceeded
to
shew
me
all
the
damage
done
to
the
vessel
during
the
night
it
was
laughable
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
poor
brute
as
he
ran
from
place
to
place
stopping
before
or
jumping
upon
every
fractured
portion
of
the
deck
and
barking
out
his
indignation
at
the
ruinous
condition
in
which
he
found
his
marine
home
oscar
had
made
eleven
voyages
in
the
anne
and
had
twice
saved
the
life
of
the
captain
he
was
an
ugly
specimen
of
the
scotch
terrier
and
greatly
resembled
a
bundle
of
old
but
a
more
faithful
or
attached
creature
i
never
saw
the
captain
was
not
a
little
jealous
of
oscar
friendship
for
me
i
was
the
only
person
the
dog
had
ever
deigned
to
notice
and
his
master
regarded
it
as
an
act
of
treason
on
the
part
of
his
favourite
when
my
arms
were
tired
with
nursing
i
had
only
to
lay
my
baby
on
my
cloak
on
deck
and
tell
oscar
to
watch
her
and
the
good
dog
would
lie
down
by
her
and
suffer
her
to
tangle
his
long
curls
in
her
little
hands
and
pull
his
tail
and
ears
in
the
most
approved
baby
fashion
without
offering
the
least
opposition
but
if
any
one
dared
to
approach
his
charge
he
was
alive
on
the
instant
placing
his
paws
over
the
child
and
growling
furiously
he
would
have
been
a
bold
man
who
had
approached
the
child
to
do
her
injury
oscar
was
the
best
plaything
and
as
sure
a
protector
as
katie
had
during
the
day
many
of
our
passengers
took
their
departure
tired
of
the
close
confinement
of
the
ship
and
the
long
voyage
they
were
too
impatient
to
remain
on
board
until
we
reached
montreal
the
mechanics
obtained
instant
employment
and
the
girls
who
were
old
enough
to
work
procured
situations
as
servants
in
the
city
before
night
our
numbers
were
greatly
reduced
the
old
dragoon
and
his
family
two
scotch
fiddlers
of
the
name
of
duncan
a
highlander
called
tam
grant
and
his
wife
and
little
son
and
our
own
party
were
all
that
remained
of
the
passengers
that
left
the
port
of
leith
in
the
brig
anne
in
spite
of
the
earnest
entreaties
of
his
young
wife
the
said
tam
grant
who
was
the
most
mercurial
fellow
in
the
world
would
insist
upon
going
on
shore
to
see
all
the
lions
of
the
place
ah
tam
tam
ye
will
die
o
the
cholera
cried
the
weeping
maggie
my
heart
will
brak
if
ye
dinna
bide
wi
me
an
the
tam
was
deaf
as
ailsa
craig
regardless
of
tears
and
entreaties
he
jumped
into
the
boat
like
a
wilful
man
as
he
was
and
my
husband
went
with
him
fortunately
for
me
the
latter
returned
safe
to
the
vessel
in
time
to
proceed
with
her
to
montreal
in
tow
of
the
noble
steamer
british
america
but
tam
the
volatile
tam
was
missing
during
the
reign
of
the
cholera
what
at
another
time
would
have
appeared
but
a
trifling
incident
was
now
invested
with
doubt
and
terror
the
distress
of
the
poor
wife
knew
no
bounds
i
think
i
see
her
now
as
i
saw
her
then
sitting
upon
the
floor
of
the
deck
her
head
buried
between
her
knees
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
weeping
in
the
utter
abandonment
of
her
grief
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
my
dear
dear
tam
the
pestilence
has
seized
upon
him
and
i
and
the
puir
bairn
are
left
alone
in
the
strange
all
attempts
at
consolation
were
useless
she
obstinately
refused
to
listen
to
probabilities
or
to
be
comforted
all
through
the
night
i
heard
her
deep
and
bitter
sobs
and
the
name
of
him
that
she
had
lost
the
sun
was
sinking
over
the
city
gilding
the
changing
woods
and
mountain
peaks
with
ruddy
light
the
river
mirrored
back
the
gorgeous
sky
and
moved
in
billows
of
liquid
gold
the
very
air
seemed
lighted
up
with
heavenly
fires
and
sparkled
with
myriads
of
luminous
particles
as
i
gazed
my
last
upon
that
beautiful
scene
the
was
now
attached
from
our
ship
to
the
british
america
and
in
company
with
two
other
vessels
we
followed
fast
in
her
foaming
wake
day
lingered
on
the
horizon
just
long
enough
to
enable
me
to
examine
with
deep
interest
the
rocky
heights
of
abraham
the
scene
of
our
immortal
wolfe
victory
and
death
and
when
the
twilight
faded
into
night
the
moon
arose
in
solemn
beauty
and
cast
mysterious
gleams
upon
the
strange
stern
landscape
the
wide
river
flowing
rapidly
between
its
rugged
banks
rolled
in
inky
blackness
beneath
the
overshadowing
crags
while
the
waves
in
flashed
along
in
dazzling
light
rendered
more
intense
by
the
surrounding
darkness
in
this
luminous
track
the
huge
steamer
glided
majestically
forward
flinging
showers
of
red
from
the
funnel
into
the
clear
air
and
looking
like
some
fiery
demon
of
the
night
enveloped
in
smoke
and
flame
the
lofty
groves
of
pine
frowned
down
in
gloom
upon
the
mighty
river
and
the
deep
stillness
of
the
night
broken
alone
by
its
hoarse
wailings
filled
my
mind
with
sad
forebodings
alas
too
prophetic
of
the
future
keenly
for
the
first
time
i
felt
that
i
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
my
heart
yearned
intensely
for
my
absent
home
home
the
word
had
ceased
to
belong
to
my
present
it
was
doomed
to
live
for
ever
in
the
past
for
what
emigrant
ever
regarded
the
country
of
his
exile
as
his
home
to
the
land
he
has
left
that
name
belongs
for
ever
and
in
no
instance
does
he
bestow
it
upon
another
i
have
got
a
letter
from
home
i
have
seen
a
friend
from
home
i
dreamt
last
night
that
i
was
at
home
are
expressions
of
everyday
occurrence
to
prove
that
the
heart
acknowledges
no
other
home
than
the
land
of
its
birth
from
these
sad
reveries
i
was
roused
by
the
hoarse
notes
of
the
bagpipe
that
sound
brought
every
scotchman
upon
deck
and
set
every
limb
in
motion
on
the
decks
of
the
other
vessels
determined
not
to
be
outdone
our
fiddlers
took
up
the
strain
and
a
lively
contest
ensued
between
the
rival
musicians
which
continued
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
the
shouts
of
noisy
revelry
were
in
no
way
congenial
to
my
feelings
nothing
tends
so
much
to
increase
our
melancholy
as
merry
music
when
the
heart
is
sad
and
i
left
the
scene
with
eyes
brimful
of
tears
and
my
mind
painfully
agitated
by
sorrowful
recollections
and
vain
regrets
the
strains
we
hear
in
foreign
lands
no
echo
from
the
heart
can
claim
the
chords
are
swept
by
strangers
hands
and
kindle
in
the
breast
no
flame
sweet
though
they
be
no
fond
remembrance
wakes
to
fling
its
hallowed
influence
the
chords
as
if
a
spirit
touch
the
string
breathing
in
soft
harmonious
words
deep
melody
the
music
of
our
native
shore
a
thousand
lovely
scenes
endears
in
magic
tones
it
murmurs
the
visions
of
our
early
years
the
hopes
of
youth
it
wreathes
again
the
flowers
we
wreathed
in
childhood
bright
unclouded
day
it
breathes
again
the
vows
we
breathed
at
beauty
shrine
when
hearts
were
gay
and
whisper
truth
it
calls
before
our
mental
sight
dear
forms
whose
tuneful
lips
are
mute
bright
sunny
eyes
long
closed
in
night
warm
hearts
now
silent
as
the
lute
that
charm
our
ears
it
thrills
the
breast
with
feelings
deep
too
deep
for
language
to
impart
and
bids
the
spirit
joy
and
weep
in
tones
that
sink
into
the
heart
and
melt
in
tears
chapter
iii
our
journey
up
the
country
fly
this
spot
the
hot
foul
air
is
rank
with
pestilence
the
crowded
marts
and
public
ways
once
populous
with
life
are
still
and
noisome
as
a
churchyard
vault
aghast
and
shuddering
nature
holds
her
breath
in
abject
fear
and
feels
at
her
strong
heart
the
deadly
pangs
of
death
of
montreal
i
can
say
but
little
the
cholera
was
at
its
height
and
the
fear
of
infection
which
increased
the
nearer
we
approached
its
shores
cast
a
gloom
over
the
scene
and
prevented
us
from
exploring
its
infected
streets
that
the
feelings
of
all
on
board
very
nearly
resembled
our
own
might
be
read
in
the
anxious
faces
of
both
passengers
and
crew
our
captain
who
had
never
before
hinted
that
he
entertained
any
apprehensions
on
the
subject
now
confided
to
us
his
conviction
that
he
should
never
quit
the
city
alive
this
cursed
cholera
left
it
in
russia
found
it
on
my
return
to
leith
meets
me
again
in
canada
no
escape
the
third
if
the
captain
prediction
proved
true
in
his
case
it
was
not
so
in
ours
we
left
the
cholera
in
england
we
met
it
again
in
scotland
and
under
the
providence
of
god
we
escaped
its
fatal
visitation
in
canada
yet
the
fear
and
the
dread
of
it
on
that
first
day
caused
me
to
throw
many
an
anxious
glance
on
my
husband
and
my
child
i
had
been
very
ill
during
the
three
weeks
that
our
vessel
was
becalmed
upon
the
banks
of
newfoundland
and
to
this
circumstance
i
attribute
my
deliverance
from
the
pestilence
i
was
weak
and
nervous
when
the
vessel
arrived
at
quebec
but
the
voyage
up
the
lawrence
the
fresh
air
and
beautiful
scenery
were
rapidly
restoring
me
to
health
montreal
from
the
river
wears
a
pleasing
aspect
but
it
lacks
the
grandeur
the
stern
sublimity
of
quebec
the
fine
mountain
that
forms
the
background
to
the
city
the
island
of
helens
in
front
and
the
junction
of
the
lawrence
and
the
ottawa
which
run
side
by
side
their
respective
boundaries
only
marked
by
a
long
ripple
of
white
foam
and
the
darker
blue
tint
of
the
former
river
constitute
the
most
remarkable
features
in
the
landscape
the
town
itself
was
at
that
period
dirty
and
and
the
opening
of
all
the
sewers
in
order
to
purify
the
place
and
stop
the
ravages
of
the
pestilence
rendered
the
public
thoroughfares
almost
impassable
and
loaded
the
air
with
intolerable
effluvia
more
likely
to
produce
than
stay
the
course
of
the
plague
the
violence
of
which
had
in
all
probability
been
increased
by
these
receptacles
of
uncleanliness
the
dismal
stories
told
us
by
the
who
came
to
inspect
the
unloading
of
the
vessel
of
the
frightful
ravages
of
the
cholera
by
no
means
increased
our
desire
to
go
on
shore
it
will
be
a
miracle
if
you
escape
he
said
hundreds
of
emigrants
die
daily
and
if
stephen
ayres
had
not
providentally
come
among
us
not
a
soul
would
have
been
alive
at
this
moment
in
and
who
is
stephen
ayres
said
i
god
only
knows
was
the
grave
reply
there
was
a
man
sent
from
heaven
and
his
name
was
but
i
thought
this
man
was
called
stephen
ay
so
he
calls
himself
but
is
certain
that
he
is
not
of
the
earth
flesh
and
blood
could
never
do
what
he
has
done
the
hand
of
god
is
in
it
besides
no
one
knows
who
he
is
or
whence
he
comes
when
the
cholera
was
at
the
worst
and
the
hearts
of
all
men
stood
still
with
fear
and
our
doctors
could
do
nothing
to
stop
its
progress
this
man
or
angel
or
saint
suddenly
made
his
appearance
in
our
streets
he
came
in
great
humility
seated
in
an
and
drawn
by
two
lean
oxen
and
a
rope
harness
only
think
of
that
such
a
man
in
an
drawn
by
harness
the
thing
itself
was
a
miracle
he
made
no
parade
about
what
he
could
do
but
only
fixed
up
a
plain
pasteboard
notice
informing
the
public
that
he
possessed
an
infallible
remedy
for
the
cholera
and
would
engage
to
cure
all
who
sent
for
and
was
he
successful
successful
it
beats
all
belief
and
his
remedy
so
simple
for
some
days
we
all
took
him
for
a
quack
and
would
have
no
faith
in
him
at
all
although
he
performed
some
wonderful
cures
upon
poor
folks
who
could
not
afford
to
send
for
the
doctor
the
indian
village
was
attacked
by
the
disease
and
he
went
out
to
them
and
restored
upward
of
a
hundred
of
the
indians
to
perfect
health
they
took
the
old
lean
oxen
out
of
the
cart
and
drew
him
back
to
montreal
in
triumph
this
him
at
once
and
in
a
few
days
time
he
made
a
fortune
the
very
doctors
sent
for
him
to
cure
them
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
a
few
days
he
will
banish
the
cholera
from
the
do
you
know
his
famous
remedy
do
i
not
did
he
not
cure
me
when
i
was
at
the
last
gasp
why
he
makes
no
secret
of
it
it
is
all
drawn
from
the
first
he
rubs
the
patient
all
over
with
an
ointment
made
of
hog
lard
and
and
ashes
from
the
and
he
gives
him
a
hot
draught
of
and
ley
which
throws
him
into
a
violent
perspiration
in
about
an
hour
the
cramps
subside
he
falls
into
a
quiet
sleep
and
when
he
awakes
he
is
perfectly
restored
to
such
were
our
first
tidings
of
stephen
ayres
the
cholera
doctor
who
is
universally
believed
to
have
effected
some
wonderful
cures
he
obtained
a
wide
celebrity
throughout
the
colony
a
friend
of
mine
in
this
town
has
an
original
portrait
of
this
notable
empiric
this
man
sent
from
heaven
the
face
is
rather
handsome
but
has
a
keen
designing
expression
and
is
evidently
that
of
an
american
from
its
complexion
and
features
the
day
of
our
arrival
in
the
port
of
montreal
was
spent
in
packing
and
preparing
for
our
long
journey
up
the
country
at
sunset
i
went
upon
deck
to
enjoy
the
refreshing
breeze
that
swept
from
the
river
the
evening
was
delightful
the
white
tents
of
the
soldiers
on
the
island
of
helens
glittered
in
the
beams
of
the
sun
and
the
wafted
over
the
waters
sounded
so
cheery
and
inspiring
that
it
banished
all
fears
of
the
cholera
and
with
fear
the
heavy
gloom
that
had
clouded
my
mind
since
we
left
quebec
i
could
once
more
hold
sweet
converse
with
nature
and
enjoy
the
soft
loveliness
of
the
rich
and
harmonious
scene
a
loud
cry
from
one
of
the
crew
startled
me
i
turned
to
the
river
and
beheld
a
man
struggling
in
the
water
a
short
distance
from
our
vessel
he
was
a
young
sailor
who
had
fallen
from
the
bowsprit
of
a
ship
near
us
there
is
something
terribly
exciting
in
beholding
a
in
imminent
peril
without
having
the
power
to
help
him
to
witness
his
to
feel
in
your
own
person
all
the
dreadful
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
and
finally
to
see
him
die
with
scarcely
an
effort
made
for
his
preservation
this
was
our
case
at
the
moment
he
fell
into
the
water
a
boat
with
three
men
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
and
actually
sailed
over
the
spot
where
he
sank
cries
of
shame
from
the
crowd
collected
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
had
no
effect
in
rousing
these
people
to
attempt
the
rescue
of
a
perishing
the
boat
passed
on
the
drowning
man
again
rose
to
the
surface
the
convulsive
motion
of
his
hands
and
feet
visible
above
the
water
but
it
was
evident
that
the
struggle
would
be
his
last
is
it
possible
that
they
will
let
a
human
being
perish
and
so
near
the
shore
when
an
oar
held
out
would
save
his
life
was
the
agonising
question
at
my
heart
as
i
gazed
by
excitement
on
the
fearful
spectacle
the
eyes
of
a
multitude
were
fixed
upon
the
same
object
but
not
a
hand
stirred
every
one
seemed
to
expect
from
his
fellow
an
effort
which
he
was
incapable
of
attempting
himself
at
this
moment
splash
a
sailor
plunged
into
the
water
from
the
deck
of
a
neighbouring
vessel
and
dived
after
the
drowning
man
a
deep
thank
god
burst
from
my
heart
i
drew
a
freer
breath
as
the
brave
fellow
head
appeared
above
the
water
he
called
to
the
man
in
the
boat
to
throw
him
an
oar
or
the
drowning
man
would
be
the
death
of
them
both
slowly
they
put
back
the
boat
the
oar
was
handed
but
it
came
too
late
the
sailor
whose
name
was
cook
had
been
obliged
to
shake
off
the
hold
of
the
dying
man
to
save
his
own
life
he
dived
again
to
the
bottom
and
succeeded
in
bringing
to
shore
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
being
he
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
succour
shortly
after
he
came
on
board
our
vessel
foaming
with
passion
at
the
barbarous
indifference
manifested
by
the
men
in
the
boat
had
they
given
me
the
oar
in
time
i
could
have
saved
him
i
knew
him
well
he
was
an
excellent
fellow
and
a
good
seaman
he
has
left
a
wife
and
three
children
in
liverpool
poor
jane
how
can
i
tell
her
that
i
could
not
save
her
husband
he
wept
bitterly
and
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
witness
his
emotion
without
joining
in
his
grief
from
the
mate
i
learned
that
this
same
young
man
had
saved
the
lives
of
three
women
and
a
child
when
the
boat
was
swamped
at
grosse
isle
in
attempting
to
land
the
passengers
from
the
horsley
hill
such
acts
of
heroism
are
common
in
the
lower
walks
of
life
thus
the
purest
gems
are
often
encased
in
the
rudest
crust
and
the
finest
feelings
of
the
human
heart
are
fostered
in
the
chilling
atmosphere
of
poverty
while
this
sad
event
occupied
all
our
thoughts
and
gave
rise
to
many
painful
reflections
an
exclamation
of
unqualified
delight
at
once
changed
the
current
of
our
thoughts
and
filled
us
with
surprise
and
pleasure
maggie
grant
had
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
husband
yes
there
was
tam
her
dear
reckless
tam
after
all
her
tears
and
lamentations
pressing
his
young
wife
to
his
heart
and
calling
her
by
a
thousand
endearing
pet
names
he
had
met
with
some
countrymen
at
quebec
had
taken
too
much
whiskey
on
the
joyful
occasion
and
lost
his
passage
in
the
anne
but
had
followed
a
few
hours
later
in
another
and
he
assured
the
now
happy
maggie
as
he
kissed
the
infant
tam
whom
she
held
up
to
his
admiring
gaze
that
he
never
would
be
guilty
of
the
like
again
perhaps
he
kept
his
word
but
i
much
fear
that
the
first
temptation
would
make
the
lively
laddie
forget
his
promise
our
luggage
having
been
removed
to
the
including
our
bedding
the
captain
collected
all
the
ship
flags
for
our
accommodation
of
which
we
formed
a
tolerably
comfortable
bed
and
if
our
dreams
were
of
england
could
it
be
otherwise
with
her
glorious
flag
wrapped
around
us
and
our
heads
resting
upon
the
union
jack
in
the
morning
we
were
obliged
to
visit
the
city
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
our
upward
journey
the
day
was
intensely
hot
a
bank
of
thunderclouds
lowered
heavily
above
the
mountain
and
the
close
dusty
streets
were
silent
and
nearly
deserted
here
and
there
might
be
seen
a
group
of
sickly
emigrants
seated
against
a
wall
among
their
packages
and
sadly
ruminating
upon
their
future
prospects
the
sullen
toll
of
the
the
exposure
of
coffins
in
the
undertakers
windows
and
the
notice
placarded
on
the
walls
of
funerals
furnished
at
such
and
such
a
place
at
cheapest
rate
and
shortest
notice
painfully
reminded
us
at
every
turning
of
the
street
that
death
was
everywhere
perhaps
lurking
in
our
very
path
we
felt
no
desire
to
examine
the
beauties
of
the
place
with
this
ominous
feeling
pervading
our
minds
public
buildings
possessed
few
attractions
and
we
determined
to
make
our
stay
as
short
as
possible
compared
with
the
infected
city
our
ship
appeared
an
ark
of
safety
and
we
returned
to
it
with
joy
and
confidence
too
soon
to
be
destroyed
we
had
scarcely
our
cabin
when
tidings
were
brought
to
us
that
the
cholera
had
made
its
appearance
a
brother
of
the
captain
had
been
attacked
it
was
advisable
that
we
should
leave
the
vessel
immediately
before
the
intelligence
could
reach
the
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
we
found
ourselves
occupying
comfortable
apartments
in
goodenough
hotel
and
our
passage
taken
in
the
stage
for
the
following
morning
the
transition
was
like
a
dream
the
change
from
the
close
rank
ship
to
large
airy
rooms
and
clean
attendants
was
a
luxury
we
should
have
enjoyed
had
not
the
dread
of
cholera
involved
all
things
around
us
in
gloom
and
apprehension
no
one
spoke
upon
the
subject
and
yet
it
was
evident
that
it
was
uppermost
in
the
thoughts
of
all
several
emigrants
had
died
of
the
terrible
disorder
during
the
week
beneath
the
very
roof
that
sheltered
us
and
its
ravages
we
were
told
had
extended
up
the
country
as
far
as
kingston
so
that
it
was
still
to
be
the
phantom
of
our
coming
journey
if
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
escape
from
its
at
six
the
following
morning
we
took
our
places
in
the
coach
for
lachine
and
our
fears
of
the
plague
greatly
diminished
as
we
left
the
spires
of
montreal
in
the
distance
the
journey
from
montreal
westward
has
been
so
well
described
by
many
gifted
pens
that
i
shall
say
little
about
it
the
banks
of
the
lawrence
are
picturesque
and
beautiful
particularly
in
those
spots
where
there
is
a
good
view
of
the
american
side
the
neat
looked
to
me
whose
eyes
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
watery
waste
homes
of
beauty
and
happiness
and
the
splendid
orchards
the
trees
at
that
season
of
the
year
being
loaded
with
ripening
fruit
of
all
hues
were
refreshing
and
delicious
my
partiality
for
the
apples
was
regarded
by
a
with
a
species
of
horror
touch
them
not
if
you
value
your
every
draught
of
fresh
air
and
water
inspired
me
with
renewed
health
and
spirits
and
i
disregarded
the
advice
the
gentlemen
who
gave
it
had
just
recovered
from
the
terrible
disease
he
was
a
man
a
farmer
from
the
upper
province
canadian
born
he
had
visited
montreal
on
business
for
the
first
time
well
sir
he
said
in
answer
to
some
questions
put
to
him
by
my
husband
respecting
the
disease
i
can
tell
you
what
it
is
a
man
smitten
with
the
cholera
stares
death
right
in
the
face
and
the
torment
he
is
suffering
is
so
great
that
he
would
gladly
die
to
get
rid
of
you
were
fortunate
c
to
escape
said
a
backwood
settler
who
occupied
the
opposite
seat
many
a
younger
man
has
died
of
ay
but
i
believe
i
never
should
have
taken
it
had
it
not
been
for
some
things
they
gave
me
for
supper
at
the
hotel
oysters
they
called
them
oysters
they
were
alive
i
was
once
persuaded
by
a
friend
to
eat
them
and
i
liked
them
well
enough
at
the
time
but
i
declare
to
you
that
i
felt
them
crawling
over
one
another
in
my
stomach
all
night
the
next
morning
i
was
seized
with
the
did
you
swallow
them
whole
c
said
the
former
spokesman
who
seemed
highly
tickled
by
the
evil
doings
of
the
oysters
to
be
sure
i
tell
you
the
creatures
are
alive
you
put
them
on
your
tongue
and
i
be
bound
you
be
glad
to
let
them
slip
down
as
fast
as
you
no
wonder
you
had
the
cholera
said
the
backwoodsman
you
deserved
it
for
your
barbarity
if
i
had
a
good
plate
of
oysters
here
i
teach
you
the
way
to
eat
our
journey
during
the
first
day
was
performed
partly
by
coach
partly
by
steam
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
when
we
landed
at
cornwell
and
took
coach
for
prescott
the
country
through
which
we
passed
appeared
beautiful
in
the
clear
light
of
the
moon
but
the
air
was
cold
and
slightly
sharpened
by
frost
this
seemed
strange
to
me
in
the
early
part
of
september
but
it
is
very
common
in
canada
nine
passengers
were
closely
packed
into
our
narrow
vehicle
but
the
sides
being
of
canvas
and
the
open
space
allowed
for
windows
unglazed
i
shivered
with
cold
which
amounted
to
a
state
of
suffering
when
the
day
broke
and
we
approached
the
little
village
of
matilda
it
was
unanimously
voted
by
all
hands
that
we
should
stop
and
breakfast
at
a
small
inn
by
the
and
warm
ourselves
before
proceeding
to
prescott
the
people
in
the
tavern
were
not
stirring
and
it
was
some
time
before
an
old
man
unclosed
the
door
and
showed
us
into
a
room
redolent
with
fumes
of
tobacco
and
darkened
by
paper
blinds
i
asked
him
if
he
would
allow
me
to
take
my
infant
into
a
room
with
a
fire
i
guess
it
was
a
pretty
considerable
cold
night
for
the
like
of
her
said
he
come
i
show
you
to
the
kitchen
there
always
a
fire
i
cheerfully
followed
accompanied
by
our
servant
our
entrance
was
unexpected
and
by
no
means
agreeable
to
the
persons
we
found
there
a
irish
servant
was
upon
her
knees
kindling
up
the
fire
and
a
long
thin
woman
with
a
sharp
face
and
an
eye
like
a
black
snake
was
just
emerging
from
a
bed
in
the
corner
we
soon
discovered
this
apparition
to
be
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
people
ca
come
in
here
she
screamed
in
a
shrill
voice
darting
daggers
at
the
poor
old
man
sure
there
a
baby
and
the
two
women
critters
are
perished
with
cold
pleaded
the
good
old
man
what
that
to
me
they
have
no
business
in
my
now
almira
do
hold
on
it
the
coach
has
stopped
to
breakfast
with
us
and
you
know
we
do
often
get
the
all
this
time
the
fair
almira
was
dressing
as
fast
as
she
could
and
eyeing
her
unwelcome
female
guests
as
we
stood
shivering
over
the
fire
breakfast
she
muttered
what
can
we
give
them
to
eat
they
pass
our
door
a
thousand
times
without
any
one
alighting
and
now
when
we
are
out
of
everything
they
must
stop
and
order
breakfast
at
such
an
unreasonable
hour
how
many
are
there
of
you
turning
fiercely
to
me
nine
i
answered
laconically
continuing
to
chafe
the
cold
hands
and
feet
of
the
child
nine
that
bit
of
beef
will
be
nothing
cut
into
steaks
for
nine
what
to
be
done
joe
to
the
old
man
eggs
and
ham
summat
of
that
dried
venison
and
pumpkin
pie
responded
the
thoughtfully
i
do
know
of
any
other
bestir
yourself
then
and
lay
out
the
table
for
the
coach
stay
long
cried
the
virago
seizing
a
from
the
wall
and
preparing
it
for
the
reception
of
eggs
and
ham
i
must
have
the
fire
to
myself
people
ca
come
crowding
here
when
i
have
to
fix
breakfast
for
nine
particularly
when
there
is
a
good
room
elsewhere
provided
for
their
i
took
the
hint
and
retreated
to
the
parlour
where
i
found
the
rest
of
the
passengers
walking
to
and
fro
and
impatiently
awaiting
the
advent
of
breakfast
to
do
almira
justice
she
prepared
from
her
scanty
materials
a
very
substantial
breakfast
in
an
incredibly
short
time
for
which
she
charged
us
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
per
head
at
prescott
we
embarked
on
board
a
fine
new
william
crowded
with
irish
emigrants
proceeding
to
cobourg
and
toronto
while
pacing
the
deck
my
husband
was
greatly
struck
by
the
appearance
of
a
man
and
his
wife
who
sat
apart
from
the
rest
and
seemed
struggling
with
intense
grief
which
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
at
concealment
was
strongly
impressed
upon
their
features
some
time
after
i
fell
into
conversation
with
the
woman
from
whom
i
learned
their
little
history
the
husband
was
factor
to
a
scotch
gentleman
of
large
landed
property
who
had
employed
him
to
visit
canada
and
report
the
capabilities
of
the
country
prior
to
his
investing
a
large
sum
of
money
in
wild
lands
the
expenses
of
their
voyage
had
been
paid
and
everything
up
to
that
morning
had
prospered
them
they
had
been
blessed
with
a
speedy
passage
and
were
greatly
pleased
with
the
country
and
the
people
but
of
what
avail
was
all
this
their
only
son
a
fine
lad
of
fourteen
had
died
that
day
of
the
cholera
and
all
their
hopes
for
the
future
were
buried
in
his
grave
for
his
sake
they
had
sought
a
home
in
this
far
land
and
here
at
the
very
onset
of
their
new
career
the
fell
disease
had
taken
him
from
them
for
ever
here
where
in
such
a
crowd
the
poor
mother
could
not
even
indulge
her
natural
grief
ah
for
a
place
where
i
might
greet
she
said
it
would
relieve
the
burning
weight
at
my
heart
but
with
sae
many
strange
eyes
glowering
upon
me
i
tak
shame
to
mysel
to
ah
jeannie
my
puir
woman
said
the
husband
grasping
her
hand
ye
maun
bear
up
is
god
will
an
sinfu
creatures
like
us
mauna
repine
but
oh
madam
turning
to
me
we
have
sair
hearts
the
day
poor
bereaved
creatures
how
deeply
i
commiserated
their
grief
how
i
respected
the
poor
father
in
the
stern
efforts
he
made
to
conceal
from
indifferent
spectators
the
anguish
that
weighed
upon
his
mind
tears
are
the
best
balm
that
can
be
applied
to
the
anguish
of
the
heart
religion
teaches
man
to
bear
his
sorrows
with
becoming
fortitude
but
tears
contribute
largely
both
to
soften
and
to
heal
the
wounds
from
whence
they
flow
at
brockville
we
took
in
a
party
of
ladies
which
somewhat
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
cabin
and
i
was
amused
by
listening
to
their
lively
prattle
and
the
little
gossip
with
which
they
strove
to
wile
away
the
tedium
of
the
voyage
the
day
was
too
stormy
to
go
upon
deck
thunder
and
lightening
accompanied
with
torrents
of
rain
amid
the
confusion
of
the
elements
i
tried
to
get
a
peep
at
the
lake
of
the
thousand
isles
but
the
driving
storm
blended
all
objects
into
one
and
i
returned
wet
and
disappointed
to
my
berth
we
passed
kingston
at
midnight
and
lost
all
our
lady
passengers
but
two
the
gale
continued
until
daybreak
and
noise
and
confusion
prevailed
all
night
which
were
greatly
increased
by
the
uproarious
conduct
of
a
wild
irish
emigrant
who
thought
fit
to
make
his
bed
upon
the
mat
before
the
cabin
door
he
sang
he
shouted
and
harangued
his
countrymen
on
the
political
state
of
the
emerald
isle
in
a
style
which
was
loud
if
not
eloquent
sleep
was
impossible
whilst
his
stentorian
lungs
continued
to
pour
forth
torrents
of
unmeaning
sound
our
dutch
stewardess
was
highly
enraged
his
conduct
she
said
was
perfectly
she
opened
the
door
and
bestowing
upon
him
several
kicks
bade
him
get
away
out
of
that
or
she
would
complain
to
the
captain
in
answer
to
this
remonstrance
he
caught
her
by
the
foot
and
pulled
her
down
then
waving
the
tattered
remains
of
his
straw
hat
in
the
air
he
shouted
with
an
air
of
triumph
git
out
wid
you
you
ould
witch
shure
the
ladies
the
purty
darlints
never
sent
you
wid
that
ugly
message
to
pat
who
loves
them
so
intirely
that
he
manes
to
kape
watch
over
them
through
the
blessed
then
making
us
a
ludicrous
bow
he
continued
ladies
i
at
yer
sarvice
i
only
wish
i
could
get
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
and
i
marry
yeas
the
stewardess
bolted
the
door
and
the
mad
fellow
kept
up
such
a
racket
that
we
all
wished
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
ontario
the
following
day
was
wet
and
gloomy
the
storm
had
protracted
the
length
of
our
voyage
for
several
hours
and
it
was
midnight
when
we
landed
at
cobourg
there
rest
written
at
midnight
on
the
river
lawrence
there
rest
when
eve
with
dewy
fingers
draws
the
curtains
of
repose
round
the
west
where
light
still
lingers
and
the
day
last
glory
glows
there
rest
in
heaven
unclouded
blue
when
twinkling
stars
steal
one
by
one
so
softly
on
the
gazer
view
as
if
they
sought
his
glance
to
shun
there
rest
when
the
silent
meads
the
deepening
shades
of
night
advance
and
sighing
through
their
fringe
of
reeds
the
mighty
stream
clear
waters
glance
there
rest
when
all
above
is
bright
and
gently
these
summer
isles
the
full
moon
pours
her
mellow
light
and
heaven
on
earth
serenely
smiles
there
rest
when
angry
storms
are
and
fear
no
longer
vigil
keeps
when
winds
are
heard
to
rave
no
more
and
ocean
troubled
spirit
sleeps
there
rest
when
to
the
pebbly
strand
the
lapsing
billows
slowly
glide
and
pillow
on
the
golden
sand
breathes
soft
and
low
the
slumbering
tide
there
rest
deep
rest
at
this
still
hour
a
holy
calm
a
pause
profound
whose
soothing
spell
and
dreamy
power
lulls
into
slumber
all
around
there
rest
for
labour
hardy
child
for
nature
tribes
of
earth
and
air
whose
sacred
balm
and
influence
mild
save
guilt
and
sorrow
all
may

there
rest
beneath
the
quiet
sod
when
life
and
all
its
sorrows
cease
and
in
the
bosom
of
his
god
the
christian
finds
eternal
peace
that
peace
the
world
can
not
bestow
the
rest
a
saviour
bought
to
bid
the
weary

chapter
iv
tom
wilson
emigration
of
all
odd
fellows
this
fellow
was
the
oddest
i
have
seen
many
strange
fish
in
my
days
but
i
never
met
with
his
about
a
month
previous
to
our
emigration
to
canada
my
husband
said
to
me
you
need
not
expect
me
home
to
dinner
i
am
going
with
my
friend
wilson
to
y
to
hear
c
lecture
upon
emigration
to
canada
he
has
just
returned
from
the
north
american
provinces
and
his
lectures
are
attended
by
vast
numbers
of
persons
who
are
anxious
to
obtain
information
on
the
subject
i
got
a
note
from
your
friend
b
this
morning
begging
me
to
come
over
and
listen
to
his
palaver
and
as
wilson
thinks
of
emigrating
in
the
spring
he
will
be
my
walking
tom
wilson
going
to
canada
said
i
as
the
door
closed
on
my
what
a
backwoodsman
he
will
make
what
a
loss
to
the
single
ladies
of
s
what
will
they
do
without
him
at
their
balls
and
picnics
one
of
my
sisters
who
was
writing
at
a
table
near
me
was
highly
amused
at
this
unexpected
announcement
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
and
indulged
in
a
long
and
hearty
laugh
i
am
certain
that
most
of
my
readers
would
have
joined
in
her
laugh
had
they
known
the
object
which
provoked
her
mirth
poor
tom
is
such
a
dreamer
said
my
sister
it
would
be
an
act
of
charity
in
moodie
to
persuade
him
from
undertaking
such
a
chase
only
that
i
fancy
my
good
brother
is
possessed
with
the
same
nay
god
forbid
said
i
i
hope
this
with
the
unpronounceable
name
will
disgust
them
with
his
eloquence
for
b
writes
me
word
in
his
droll
way
that
he
is
a
coarse
vulgar
fellow
and
lacks
the
dignity
of
a
bear
oh
i
am
certain
they
will
return
quite
sickened
with
the
canadian
thus
i
laid
the
flattering
unction
to
my
soul
little
dreaming
that
i
and
mine
should
share
in
the
strange
adventures
of
this
oddest
of
all
odd
creatures
it
might
be
made
a
subject
of
curious
inquiry
to
those
who
delight
in
human
absurdities
if
ever
there
were
a
character
drawn
in
works
of
fiction
so
extravagantly
ridiculous
as
some
which
daily
experience
presents
to
our
view
we
have
encountered
people
in
the
broad
thoroughfares
of
life
more
eccentric
than
ever
we
read
of
in
books
people
who
if
all
their
foolish
sayings
and
doings
were
duly
recorded
would
vie
with
the
drollest
creations
of
hood
or
george
colman
and
put
to
shame
the
flights
of
baron
munchausen
not
that
tom
wilson
was
a
romancer
oh
no
he
was
the
very
prose
of
prose
a
man
in
a
mist
who
seemed
afraid
of
moving
about
for
fear
of
knocking
his
head
against
a
tree
and
finding
a
halter
suspended
to
its
branches
a
man
as
helpless
and
as
indolent
as
a
baby
thomas
or
tom
wilson
as
he
was
familiarly
called
by
all
his
friends
and
acquaintances
was
the
son
of
a
gentleman
who
once
possessed
a
large
landed
property
in
the
neighbourhood
but
an
extravagant
and
profligate
expenditure
of
the
income
which
he
derived
from
a
fine
estate
which
had
descended
from
father
to
son
through
many
generations
had
greatly
reduced
the
circumstances
of
the
elder
wilson
still
his
family
held
a
certain
rank
and
standing
in
their
native
county
of
which
his
evil
courses
bad
as
they
were
could
not
wholly
deprive
them
the
young
people
and
a
very
large
family
they
made
of
sons
and
daughters
twelve
in
number
were
objects
of
interest
and
commiseration
to
all
who
knew
them
while
the
worthless
father
was
justly
held
in
contempt
and
detestation
our
hero
was
the
youngest
of
the
six
sons
and
from
his
childhood
he
was
famous
for
his
he
was
too
indolent
to
engage
heart
and
soul
in
the
manly
sports
of
his
comrades
and
he
never
thought
it
necessary
to
commence
learning
his
lessons
until
the
school
had
been
in
an
hour
as
he
grew
up
to
man
estate
he
might
be
seen
dawdling
about
in
a
black
jean
trousers
and
white
kid
gloves
making
lazy
bows
to
the
pretty
girls
of
his
acquaintance
or
dressed
in
a
green
with
a
gun
across
his
shoulder
sauntering
down
the
wooded
lanes
with
a
brown
spaniel
dodging
at
his
heels
and
looking
as
sleepy
and
indolent
as
his
master
the
slowness
of
all
tom
movements
was
strangely
contrasted
with
his
slight
and
symmetrical
figure
that
looked
as
if
it
only
awaited
the
will
of
the
owner
to
be
the
most
active
piece
of
human
machinery
that
ever
responded
to
the
impulses
of
youth
and
health
but
then
his
face
what
pencil
could
faithfully
delineate
features
at
once
so
comical
and
lugubrious
features
that
one
moment
expressed
the
most
solemn
seriousness
and
the
next
the
most
grotesque
and
absurd
abandonment
to
mirth
in
him
all
extremes
appeared
to
meet
the
man
was
a
contradiction
to
himself
tom
was
a
person
of
few
words
and
so
intensely
lazy
that
it
required
a
strong
effort
of
will
to
enable
him
to
answer
the
questions
of
inquiring
friends
and
when
at
length
aroused
to
exercise
his
colloquial
powers
he
performed
the
task
in
so
original
a
manner
that
it
never
failed
to
upset
the
gravity
of
the
interrogator
when
he
raised
his
large
prominent
eyes
from
the
ground
and
looked
the
inquirer
steadily
in
the
face
the
effect
was
irresistible
the
laugh
would
come
do
your
best
to
resist
it
poor
tom
took
this
mistimed
merriment
in
very
good
part
generally
answering
with
a
ghastly
contortion
which
he
meant
for
a
smile
or
if
he
did
trouble
himself
to
find
words
with
well
that
funny
what
makes
you
laugh
at
me
i
suppose
i
do
wonder
at
it
i
often
laugh
at
tom
would
have
been
a
treasure
to
an
undertaker
he
would
have
been
celebrated
as
a
mute
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
born
in
a
shroud
and
rocked
in
a
coffin
the
gravity
with
which
he
could
answer
a
ridiculous
or
impertinent
question
completely
disarmed
and
turned
the
shafts
of
malice
back
upon
his
opponent
if
tom
was
himself
an
object
of
ridicule
to
many
he
had
a
way
of
quietly
ridiculing
others
that
bade
defiance
to
all
competition
he
could
quiz
with
a
smile
and
put
down
insolence
with
an
incredulous
stare
a
grave
wink
from
those
dreamy
eyes
would
destroy
the
veracity
of
a
travelled
dandy
for
ever
tom
was
not
without
use
in
his
day
and
generation
queer
and
awkward
as
he
was
he
was
the
soul
of
truth
and
honour
you
might
suspect
his
sanity
a
matter
always
doubtful
but
his
honesty
of
heart
and
purpose
never
when
you
met
tom
in
the
streets
he
was
dressed
with
such
neatness
and
care
to
be
sure
it
took
him
half
the
day
to
make
his
toilet
that
it
led
many
persons
to
imagine
that
this
very
ugly
young
man
considered
himself
an
adonis
and
i
must
confess
that
i
rather
inclined
to
this
opinion
he
always
paced
the
public
streets
with
a
slow
deliberate
tread
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
intently
on
the
ground
like
a
man
who
had
lost
his
ideas
and
was
diligently
employed
in
searching
for
them
i
chanced
to
meet
him
one
day
in
this
dreamy
mood
how
do
you
do
wilson
he
stared
at
me
for
several
minutes
as
if
doubtful
of
my
presence
or
identity
what
was
that
you
said
i
repeated
the
question
and
he
answered
with
one
of
his
incredulous
smiles
was
it
to
me
you
spoke
oh
i
am
quite
well
or
i
should
not
be
walking
here
by
the
way
did
you
see
my
dog
how
should
i
know
your
dog
they
say
he
resembles
me
he
a
queer
dog
too
but
i
never
could
find
out
the
likeness
good
night
this
was
at
noonday
but
tom
had
a
habit
of
taking
light
for
darkness
and
darkness
for
light
in
all
he
did
or
said
he
must
have
had
different
eyes
and
ears
and
a
different
way
of
seeing
hearing
and
comprehending
than
is
possessed
by
the
generality
of
his
species
and
to
such
a
length
did
he
carry
this
abstraction
of
soul
and
sense
that
he
would
often
leave
you
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
if
you
chanced
to
meet
him
some
weeks
after
he
would
resume
the
conversation
with
the
very
word
at
which
he
had
cut
short
the
thread
of
your
discourse
a
lady
once
told
him
in
jest
that
her
youngest
brother
a
lad
of
twelve
years
old
had
called
his
donkey
braham
in
honour
of
the
great
singer
of
that
name
tom
made
no
answer
but
started
abruptly
away
three
months
after
she
happened
to
encounter
him
on
the
same
spot
when
he
accosted
her
without
any
previous
salutation
you
were
telling
me
about
a
donkey
miss
a
donkey
of
your
brother
braham
i
think
you
called
him
yes
braham
a
strange
name
for
an
ass
i
wonder
what
the
great
braham
would
say
to
that
ha
ha
ha
your
memory
must
be
excellent
wilson
to
enable
you
to
remember
such
a
trifling
circumstance
all
this
trifling
do
you
call
it
why
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
ever
from
traits
such
as
these
my
readers
will
be
tempted
to
imagine
him
brother
to
the
animal
who
had
dwelt
so
long
in
his
thoughts
but
there
were
times
when
he
surmounted
this
strange
absence
of
mind
and
could
talk
and
act
as
sensibly
as
other
folks
on
the
death
of
his
father
he
emigrated
to
new
south
wales
where
he
contrived
to
doze
away
seven
years
of
his
valueless
existence
suffering
his
convict
servants
to
rob
him
of
everything
and
finally
to
burn
his
dwelling
he
returned
to
his
native
village
dressed
as
an
italian
mendicant
with
a
monkey
perched
upon
his
shoulder
and
playing
airs
of
his
own
composition
upon
a
in
this
disguise
he
sought
the
dwelling
of
an
old
bachelor
uncle
and
solicited
his
charity
but
who
that
had
once
seen
our
friend
tom
could
ever
forget
him
nature
had
no
counterpart
of
one
who
in
mind
and
form
was
alike
original
the
old
soldier
at
a
glance
discovered
his
hopeful
nephew
received
him
into
his
house
with
kindness
and
had
afforded
him
an
asylum
ever
since
one
little
anecdote
of
him
at
this
period
will
illustrate
the
quiet
love
of
mischief
with
which
he
was
imbued
travelling
from
w
to
london
in
the
railways
were
not
invented
in
those
days
he
entered
into
conversation
with
an
intelligent
farmer
who
sat
next
to
him
new
south
wales
and
his
residence
in
that
colony
forming
the
leading
topic
a
dissenting
minister
who
happened
to
be
his
and
who
had
annoyed
him
by
making
several
impertinent
remarks
suddenly
asked
him
with
a
sneer
how
many
years
he
had
been
there
seven
returned
tom
in
a
solemn
tone
without
deigning
a
glance
at
his
companion
i
thought
so
responded
the
other
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
and
pray
sir
what
were
you
sent
there
for
stealing
pigs
returned
the
incorrigible
tom
with
the
gravity
of
a
judge
the
words
were
scarcely
pronounced
when
the
questioner
called
the
coachman
to
stop
preferring
a
ride
outside
in
the
rain
to
a
seat
within
with
a
thief
tom
greatly
enjoyed
the
hoax
which
he
used
to
tell
with
the
merriest
of
all
grave
faces
besides
being
a
devoted
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
and
always
imagining
himself
in
love
with
some
unattainable
beauty
he
had
a
passionate
craze
for
music
and
played
upon
the
violin
and
flute
with
considerable
taste
and
execution
the
sound
of
a
favourite
melody
operated
upon
the
breathing
automaton
like
magic
his
frozen
faculties
experienced
a
sudden
thaw
and
the
stream
of
life
leaped
and
gambolled
for
a
while
with
uncontrollable
vivacity
he
laughed
danced
sang
and
made
love
in
a
breath
committing
a
thousand
mad
vagaries
to
make
you
acquainted
with
his
existence
my
husband
had
a
remarkably
flute
and
this
flute
tom
regarded
with
a
species
of
idolatry
i
break
the
tenth
commandment
moodie
whenever
i
hear
you
play
upon
that
flute
take
care
of
your
black
wife
a
name
he
had
bestowed
upon
the
coveted
treasure
or
i
shall
certainly
run
off
with
i
am
half
afraid
of
you
tom
i
am
sure
if
i
were
to
die
and
leave
you
my
black
wife
as
a
legacy
you
would
be
too
much
overjoyed
to
lament
my
such
was
the
strange
helpless
whimsical
being
who
now
contemplated
an
emigration
to
canada
how
he
succeeded
in
the
speculation
the
sequel
will
show
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
my
husband
and
his
friend
tom
wilson
returned
from
y
i
had
provided
a
hot
supper
and
a
cup
of
coffee
after
their
long
walk
and
they
did
ample
justice
to
my
care
tom
was
in
unusually
high
spirits
and
appeared
wholly
bent
upon
his
canadian
expedition
mr
c
must
have
been
very
eloquent
wilson
said
i
to
engage
your
attention
for
so
many
perhaps
he
was
returned
tom
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
groping
for
words
in
the
having
deliberately
turned
out
its
contents
upon
the
tablecloth
we
were
hungry
after
our
long
walk
and
he
gave
us
an
excellent
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
substance
of
his
it
was
the
substance
after
all
said
moodie
laughing
and
his
audience
seemed
to
think
so
by
the
attention
they
paid
to
it
during
the
discussion
but
come
wilson
give
my
wife
some
account
of
the
intellectual
part
of
the
what
i
i
i
i
give
an
account
of
the
lecture
why
my
dear
fellow
i
never
listened
to
one
word
of
it
i
thought
you
went
to
y
on
purpose
to
obtain
information
on
the
subject
of
emigration
to
canada
well
and
so
i
did
but
when
the
fellow
pulled
out
his
pamphlet
and
said
that
it
contained
the
substance
of
his
lecture
and
would
only
cost
a
shilling
i
thought
that
it
was
better
to
secure
the
substance
than
endeavour
to
catch
the
shadow
so
i
bought
the
book
and
spared
myself
the
pain
of
listening
to
the
oratory
of
the
writer
moodie
he
had
a
shocking
delivery
a
drawling
vulgar
voice
and
he
spoke
with
such
a
nasal
twang
that
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
or
listen
to
him
he
made
such
grammatical
blunders
that
my
sides
ached
with
laughing
at
him
oh
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
wretch
but
here
is
the
document
written
in
the
same
style
in
which
it
was
spoken
read
it
you
have
a
rich
treat
in
i
took
the
pamphlet
not
a
little
amused
at
his
description
of
c
for
whom
i
felt
an
uncharitable
dislike
and
how
did
you
contrive
to
entertain
yourself
wilson
during
his
long
address
by
thinking
how
many
fools
were
collected
together
to
listen
to
one
greater
than
the
rest
by
the
way
moodie
did
you
notice
farmer
flitch
no
where
did
he
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
table
you
must
have
seen
him
he
was
too
big
to
be
overlooked
what
a
delightful
squint
he
had
what
a
ridiculous
likeness
there
was
between
him
and
the
roast
pig
he
was
carving
i
was
wondering
all
how
that
man
contrived
to
cut
up
that
pig
for
one
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
other
leering
very
affectionately
at
me
it
was
very
droll
was
it
not
and
what
do
you
intend
doing
with
yourself
when
you
arrive
in
canada
said
i
find
out
some
large
hollow
tree
and
live
like
bruin
in
winter
by
sucking
my
paws
in
the
summer
there
will
be
plenty
of
mast
and
acorns
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
an
abstemious
but
joking
apart
my
dear
fellow
said
my
husband
anxious
to
induce
him
to
abandon
a
scheme
so
hopeless
do
you
think
that
you
are
at
all
qualified
for
a
life
of
toil
and
hardship
are
you
returned
tom
raising
his
large
bushy
black
eyebrows
to
the
top
of
his
forehead
and
fixing
his
leaden
eyes
steadfastly
upon
his
interrogator
with
an
air
of
such
absurd
gravity
that
we
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
now
what
do
you
laugh
for
i
am
sure
i
asked
you
a
very
serious
but
your
method
of
putting
it
is
so
unusual
that
you
must
excuse
us
for
i
do
want
you
to
weep
said
tom
but
as
to
our
qualifications
moodie
i
think
them
pretty
equal
i
know
you
think
otherwise
but
i
will
explain
let
me
see
what
was
i
going
to
say
ah
i
have
it
you
go
with
the
intention
of
clearing
land
and
working
for
yourself
and
doing
a
great
deal
i
have
tried
that
before
in
new
south
wales
and
i
know
that
it
wo
answer
gentlemen
ca
work
like
labourers
and
if
they
could
they
wo
it
is
not
in
them
and
that
you
will
find
out
you
expect
by
going
to
canada
to
make
your
fortune
or
at
least
secure
a
comfortable
independence
i
anticipate
no
such
results
yet
i
mean
to
go
partly
out
of
a
whim
partly
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
whether
it
is
a
better
country
than
new
south
wales
and
lastly
in
the
hope
of
bettering
my
condition
in
a
small
way
which
at
present
is
so
bad
that
it
can
scarcely
be
worse
i
mean
to
purchase
a
farm
with
the
three
hundred
pounds
i
received
last
week
from
the
sale
of
my
father
property
and
if
the
canadian
soil
yields
only
half
what
c
says
it
does
i
need
not
starve
but
the
refined
habits
in
which
you
have
been
brought
up
and
your
unfortunate
literary
propensities
i
say
unfortunate
because
you
will
seldom
meet
people
in
a
colony
who
can
or
will
sympathise
with
you
in
these
pursuits
they
will
make
you
an
object
of
mistrust
and
envy
to
those
who
can
not
appreciate
them
and
will
be
a
source
of
constant
mortification
and
disappointment
to
yourself
thank
god
i
have
no
literary
propensities
but
in
spite
of
the
latter
advantage
in
all
probability
i
shall
make
no
exertion
at
all
so
that
your
energy
damped
by
disgust
and
disappointment
and
my
laziness
will
end
in
the
same
thing
and
we
shall
both
return
like
bad
pennies
to
our
native
shores
but
as
i
have
neither
wife
nor
child
to
involve
in
my
failure
i
think
without
much
that
my
prospects
are
better
than
this
was
the
longest
speech
i
ever
heard
tom
utter
and
evidently
astonished
at
himself
he
sprang
abruptly
from
the
table
overset
a
cup
of
coffee
into
my
lap
and
wishing
us
it
was
eleven
at
night
he
ran
out
of
the
house
there
was
more
truth
in
poor
tom
words
than
at
that
moment
we
were
willing
to
allow
for
youth
and
hope
were
on
our
side
in
those
days
and
we
were
most
ready
to
believe
the
suggestions
of
the
latter
my
husband
finally
determined
to
emigrate
to
canada
and
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
a
sudden
preparation
to
depart
tom
and
his
affairs
for
a
while
were
forgotten
how
dark
and
heavily
did
that
frightful
anticipation
weigh
upon
my
heart
as
the
time
for
our
departure
drew
near
the
thought
of
leaving
my
friends
and
native
land
became
so
intensely
painful
that
it
haunted
me
even
in
sleep
i
seldom
awoke
without
finding
my
pillow
wet
with
tears
the
glory
of
may
was
upon
the
earth
of
an
english
may
the
woods
were
bursting
into
leaf
the
meadows
and
were
flushed
with
flowers
and
every
grove
and
copsewood
echoed
to
the
warblings
of
birds
and
the
humming
of
bees
to
leave
england
at
all
was
dreadful
to
leave
her
at
such
a
season
was
doubly
so
i
went
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
old
hall
the
beloved
home
of
my
childhood
and
youth
to
wander
once
more
beneath
the
shade
of
its
venerable
oaks
to
rest
once
more
upon
the
velvet
sward
that
carpeted
their
roots
it
was
while
reposing
beneath
those
noble
trees
that
i
had
first
indulged
in
those
delicious
dreams
which
are
a
foretaste
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
in
them
the
soul
breathes
forth
its
aspirations
in
a
language
unknown
to
common
minds
and
that
language
is
poetry
here
annually
from
year
to
year
i
had
renewed
my
friendship
with
the
first
primroses
and
violets
and
listened
with
the
untiring
ear
of
love
to
the
spring
roundelay
of
the
blackbird
whistled
from
among
his
bower
of
may
blossoms
here
i
had
discoursed
sweet
words
to
the
tinkling
brook
and
learned
from
the
melody
of
waters
the
music
of
natural
sounds
in
these
beloved
solitudes
all
the
holy
emotions
which
stir
the
human
heart
in
its
depths
had
been
freely
poured
forth
and
found
a
response
in
the
harmonious
voice
of
nature
bearing
aloft
the
choral
song
of
earth
to
the
throne
of
the
creator
how
hard
it
was
to
tear
myself
from
scenes
endeared
to
me
by
the
most
beautiful
and
sorrowful
recollections
let
those
who
have
loved
and
suffered
as
i
did
say
however
the
world
had
frowned
upon
me
nature
arrayed
in
her
green
loveliness
had
ever
smiled
upon
me
like
an
indulgent
mother
holding
out
her
loving
arms
to
enfold
to
her
bosom
her
erring
but
devoted
child
dear
dear
england
why
was
i
forced
by
a
stern
necessity
to
leave
you
what
heinous
crime
had
i
committed
that
i
who
adored
you
should
be
torn
from
your
sacred
bosom
to
pine
out
my
joyless
existence
in
a
foreign
clime
oh
that
i
might
be
permitted
to
return
and
die
upon
your
shores
and
rest
my
weary
head
and
heart
beneath
your
sod
at
last
ah
these
are
vain
outbursts
of
feeling
melancholy
relapses
of
the
spring
canada
thou
art
a
noble
free
and
rising
country
the
great
fostering
mother
of
the
orphans
of
civilisation
the
offspring
of
britain
thou
must
be
great
and
i
will
and
do
love
thee
land
of
my
adoption
and
of
my
children
birth
and
oh
dearer
still
to
a
mother
of
their
graves
whilst
talking
over
our
coming
separation
with
my
sister
c
we
observed
tom
wilson
walking
slowly
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
house
he
was
dressed
in
a
new
with
his
gun
lying
carelessly
across
his
shoulder
and
an
ugly
pointer
dog
following
at
a
little
distance
well
moodie
i
am
off
said
tom
shaking
hands
with
my
sister
instead
of
me
i
suppose
i
shall
see
moodie
in
london
what
do
you
think
of
my
dog
patting
him
affectionately
i
think
him
an
ugly
beast
said
c
do
you
mean
to
take
him
with
you
an
ugly
beast
duchess
a
beast
why
she
is
a
perfect
beauty
beauty
and
the
beast
ha
ha
ha
i
gave
two
guineas
for
her
last
i
thought
of
the
old
adage
mrs
moodie
your
sister
is
no
judge
of
a
very
likely
returned
c
laughing
and
you
go
to
town
wilson
i
thought
as
you
came
up
to
the
house
that
you
were
equipped
for
to
be
sure
there
is
capital
shooting
in
so
i
have
heard
plenty
of
bears
and
wolves
i
suppose
you
take
out
your
dog
and
gun
in
anticipation
true
said
tom
but
you
surely
are
not
going
to
take
that
dog
with
you
indeed
i
am
she
is
a
most
valuable
brute
the
very
best
venture
i
could
take
my
brother
charles
has
engaged
our
passage
in
the
same
it
would
be
a
pity
to
part
you
said
i
may
you
prove
as
lucky
a
pair
as
whittington
and
his
whittington
whittington
said
tom
staring
at
my
sister
and
beginning
to
dream
which
he
invariably
did
in
the
company
of
women
who
was
the
gentleman
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
one
whom
i
have
known
since
i
was
a
very
little
girl
said
my
sister
but
i
have
not
time
to
tell
you
more
about
him
now
if
you
so
to
paul
churchyard
and
inquire
for
sir
richard
whittington
and
his
cat
you
will
get
his
history
for
a
mere
do
not
mind
her
wilson
she
is
quizzing
you
quoth
i
i
wish
you
a
safe
voyage
across
the
atlantic
i
wish
i
could
add
a
happy
meeting
with
your
friends
but
where
shall
we
find
friends
in
a
strange
land
all
in
good
time
said
tom
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
before
three
months
are
over
what
adventures
we
shall
have
to
tell
one
another
it
will
be
capital
tom
has
sailed
said
captain
charles
wilson
stepping
into
my
little
parlour
a
few
days
after
his
eccentric
brother
last
visit
i
saw
him
and
duchess
safe
on
board
odd
as
he
is
i
parted
with
him
with
a
full
heart
i
felt
as
if
we
never
should
meet
again
poor
tom
he
is
the
only
brother
left
me
now
that
i
can
love
robert
and
i
never
agreed
very
well
and
there
is
little
chance
of
our
meeting
in
this
world
he
is
married
and
settled
down
for
life
in
new
south
wales
and
the
rest
john
richard
george
are
all
gone
all
was
tom
in
good
spirits
when
you
parted
yes
he
is
a
perfect
contradiction
he
always
laughs
and
cries
in
the
wrong
place
he
said
with
a
loud
laugh
the
girls
to
get
some
new
music
against
i
return
and
hark
ye
if
i
never
come
back
i
leave
them
my
kangaroo
waltz
as
a
legacy
what
a
strange
creature
strange
indeed
you
do
know
half
his
oddities
he
has
very
little
money
to
take
out
with
him
but
he
actually
paid
for
two
berths
in
the
ship
that
he
might
not
chance
to
have
a
person
who
snored
sleep
near
him
thirty
pounds
thrown
away
upon
the
mere
chance
of
a
snoring
companion
charles
quoth
he
can
not
endure
to
share
my
little
cabin
with
others
they
will
use
my
towels
and
combs
and
brushes
like
that
confounded
rascal
who
slept
in
the
same
berth
with
me
coming
from
new
south
wales
who
had
the
impudence
to
clean
his
teeth
with
my
toothbrush
here
i
shall
be
all
alone
happy
and
comfortable
as
a
prince
and
duchess
shall
sleep
in
the
and
be
my
queen
and
so
we
parted
continued
captain
charles
may
god
take
care
of
him
for
he
never
could
take
care
of
that
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
going
with
us
he
was
afraid
that
my
baby
would
keep
him
awake
of
a
night
he
hates
children
and
says
that
he
never
will
marry
on
that
we
left
the
british
shores
on
the
of
july
and
cast
anchor
as
i
have
already
shown
under
the
castle
of
louis
at
quebec
on
the
of
september
tom
wilson
sailed
the
of
may
and
had
a
speedy
passage
and
was
as
we
heard
from
his
friends
comfortably
settled
in
the
bush
had
bought
a
farm
and
meant
to
commence
operations
in
the
fall
all
this
was
good
news
and
as
he
was
settled
near
my
brother
location
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
our
eccentric
friend
had
found
a
home
in
the
wilderness
at
last
and
that
we
should
soon
see
him
again
on
the
of
september
the
william
iv
landed
us
at
the
then
small
but
rising
town
of
on
lake
ontario
the
night
was
dark
and
rainy
the
boat
was
crowded
with
emigrants
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
inn
we
learnt
that
there
was
no
room
for
us
not
a
bed
to
be
had
nor
was
it
likely
owing
to
the
number
of
strangers
that
had
arrived
for
several
weeks
that
we
could
obtain
one
by
searching
farther
moodie
requested
the
use
of
a
sofa
for
me
during
the
night
but
even
that
produced
a
demur
from
the
landlord
whilst
i
awaited
the
result
in
a
passage
crowded
with
strange
faces
a
pair
of
eyes
glanced
upon
me
through
the
throng
was
it
possible
could
it
be
tom
wilson
did
any
other
human
being
possess
such
eyes
or
use
them
in
such
an
eccentric
manner
in
another
second
he
had
pushed
his
way
to
my
side
whispering
in
my
ear
we
met
was
in
a
tom
wilson
is
that
you
do
you
doubt
it
i
flatter
myself
that
there
is
no
likeness
of
such
a
handsome
fellow
to
be
found
in
the
world
it
is
i
i
swear
although
very
little
of
me
is
left
to
swear
by
the
best
part
of
me
i
have
left
to
fatten
the
mosquitoes
and
black
flies
in
that
infernal
bush
but
where
is
moodie
there
he
is
trying
to
induce
s
for
love
or
money
to
let
me
have
a
bed
for
the
you
shall
have
mine
said
tom
i
can
sleep
upon
the
floor
of
the
parlour
in
a
blanket
indian
fashion
it
a
bargain
i
go
and
settle
it
with
the
yankee
directly
he
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
in
the
meanwhile
here
is
a
little
parlour
which
is
a
affair
between
some
of
us
young
hopefuls
for
the
time
being
step
in
here
and
i
will
go
for
moodie
i
long
to
tell
him
what
i
think
of
this
confounded
country
but
you
will
find
it
out
all
in
good
time
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
a
most
lively
and
mischievous
expression
he
shouldered
his
way
through
trunks
and
boxes
and
anxious
faces
to
communicate
to
my
husband
the
arrangement
he
had
so
kindly
made
for
us
accept
this
gentleman
offer
sir
till
said
s
i
can
then
make
more
comfortable
arrangements
for
your
family
but
we
are
crowded
crowded
to
excess
my
wife
and
daughters
are
obliged
to
sleep
in
a
little
chamber
over
the
stable
to
give
our
guests
more
room
hard
that
i
guess
for
decent
people
to
locate
over
the
these
matters
settled
moodie
returned
with
tom
wilson
to
the
little
parlour
in
which
i
had
already
made
myself
at
home
well
now
is
it
not
funny
that
i
should
be
the
first
to
welcome
you
to
canada
said
tom
but
what
are
you
doing
here
my
dear
fellow
shaking
every
day
with
the
ague
but
i
could
laugh
in
spite
of
my
teeth
to
hear
them
make
such
a
confounded
rattling
you
would
think
they
were
all
quarrelling
which
should
first
get
out
of
my
mouth
this
shaking
mania
forms
one
of
the
chief
attractions
of
this
new
i
fear
said
i
remarking
how
thin
and
pale
he
had
become
that
this
climate
can
not
agree
with
nor
i
with
the
climate
well
we
shall
soon
be
quits
for
to
let
you
into
a
secret
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
impossible
it
is
and
the
farm
what
have
you
done
with
it
sold
and
your
outfit
sold
that
to
whom
to
one
who
will
take
better
care
of
both
than
i
did
ah
such
a
country
such
people
such
rogues
it
beats
australia
hollow
you
know
your
customers
there
but
here
you
have
to
find
them
out
such
a
god
forgive
them
i
never
could
take
care
of
money
and
one
way
or
other
they
have
cheated
me
out
of
all
mine
i
have
scarcely
enough
left
to
pay
my
passage
home
but
to
provide
against
the
worst
i
have
bought
a
young
bear
a
splendid
fellow
to
make
my
peace
with
my
uncle
you
must
see
him
he
is
close
by
in
the
we
will
pay
a
visit
to
bruin
but
tonight
do
tell
us
something
about
yourself
and
your
residence
in
the
you
will
know
enough
about
the
bush
i
am
a
bad
historian
he
continued
stretching
out
his
legs
and
yawning
horribly
a
worse
biographer
i
never
can
find
words
to
relate
facts
but
i
will
try
what
i
can
do
mind
do
laugh
at
my
we
promised
to
be
serious
no
easy
matter
while
looking
at
and
listening
to
tom
wilson
and
he
gave
us
at
detached
intervals
the
following
account
of
himself
my
troubles
began
at
sea
we
had
a
fair
voyage
and
all
that
but
my
poor
dog
my
beautiful
duchess
that
beauty
in
the
beast
died
i
wanted
to
read
the
funeral
service
over
her
but
the
captain
interfered
the
brute
and
threatened
to
throw
me
into
the
sea
along
with
the
dead
bitch
as
the
unmannerly
ruffian
persisted
in
calling
my
canine
friend
i
never
spoke
to
him
again
during
the
rest
of
the
voyage
nothing
happened
worth
relating
until
i
got
to
this
place
where
i
chanced
to
meet
a
friend
who
knew
your
brother
and
i
went
up
with
him
to
the
woods
most
of
the
wise
men
of
gotham
we
met
on
the
road
were
bound
to
the
woods
so
i
felt
happy
that
i
was
at
least
in
the
fashion
was
very
kind
and
spoke
in
raptures
of
the
woods
which
formed
the
theme
of
conversation
during
our
journey
their
beauty
their
vastness
the
comfort
and
independence
enjoyed
by
those
who
had
settled
in
them
and
he
so
inspired
me
with
the
subject
that
i
did
nothing
all
day
but
sing
as
we
rode
along
life
in
the
woods
for
me
until
we
came
to
the
woods
and
then
i
soon
learned
to
sing
that
same
as
the
irishman
says
on
the
other
side
of
my
here
succeeded
a
long
pause
during
which
friend
tom
seemed
mightily
tickled
with
his
reminiscences
for
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
from
time
to
time
gave
way
to
loud
hollow
bursts
of
laughter
tom
tom
are
you
going
mad
said
my
husband
shaking
him
i
never
was
sane
that
i
know
of
returned
he
you
know
that
it
runs
in
the
family
but
do
let
me
have
my
laugh
out
the
woods
ha
ha
when
i
used
to
be
roaming
through
those
woods
shooting
though
not
a
thing
could
i
ever
find
to
shoot
for
birds
and
beasts
are
not
such
fools
as
our
english
emigrants
and
i
chanced
to
think
of
you
coming
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
lives
in
the
woods
i
used
to
stop
and
hold
my
sides
and
laugh
until
the
woods
rang
again
it
was
the
only
consolation
i
good
heavens
said
i
let
us
never
go
to
the
you
will
repent
if
you
do
continued
tom
but
let
me
proceed
on
my
journey
my
bones
were
dislocated
before
we
got
to
d
the
roads
for
the
last
twelve
miles
were
nothing
but
a
succession
of
covered
with
the
most
ingenious
invention
ever
thought
of
for
racking
the
limbs
called
corduroy
bridges
not
breeches
mind
you
for
i
thought
whilst
jolting
up
and
down
over
them
that
i
should
arrive
at
my
destination
minus
that
indispensable
covering
it
was
night
when
we
got
to
place
i
was
tired
and
hungry
my
face
disfigured
and
blistered
by
the
unremitting
attentions
of
the
blackflies
that
rose
in
swarms
from
the
river
i
thought
to
get
a
private
room
to
wash
and
dress
in
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
privacy
in
this
country
in
the
bush
all
things
are
in
common
you
can
not
even
get
a
bed
without
having
to
share
it
with
a
companion
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
a
public
think
of
that
a
public
men
women
and
children
only
divided
by
a
paltry
curtain
oh
ye
gods
think
of
the
snoring
squalling
grumbling
puffing
think
of
the
kicking
elbowing
and
crowding
the
suffocating
heat
the
mosquitoes
with
their
infernal
buzzing
and
you
will
form
some
idea
of
the
misery
i
endured
the
first
night
of
my
arrival
in
the
bush
but
these
are
not
half
the
evils
with
which
you
have
to
contend
you
are
pestered
with
nocturnal
visitants
far
more
disagreeable
than
even
the
mosquitoes
and
must
put
up
with
annoyances
more
disgusting
than
the
crowded
close
room
and
then
to
appease
the
cravings
of
hunger
fat
pork
is
served
to
you
three
times
a
day
no
wonder
that
the
jews
eschewed
the
vile
animal
they
were
people
of
taste
pork
morning
noon
and
night
swimming
in
its
own
grease
the
bishop
who
complained
of
partridges
every
day
should
have
been
condemned
to
three
months
feeding
upon
pork
in
the
bush
and
he
would
have
become
an
anchorite
to
escape
the
horrid
sight
of
swine
flesh
for
ever
spread
before
him
no
wonder
i
am
thin
i
have
been
starved
starved
upon
pritters
and
port
and
that
disgusting
specimen
of
unleavened
bread
yclept
cakes
in
the
pan
i
had
such
a
horror
of
the
pork
diet
that
whenever
i
saw
the
dinner
in
progress
i
fled
to
the
canoe
in
the
hope
of
drowning
upon
the
waters
all
reminiscences
of
the
hateful
banquet
but
even
here
the
very
fowls
of
the
air
and
the
reptiles
of
the
deep
lifted
up
their
voices
and
shouted
pork
pork
m
remonstrated
with
his
friend
for
deserting
the
country
for
such
minor
evils
as
these
which
after
all
he
said
could
easily
be
borne
easily
borne
exclaimed
the
indignant
wilson
go
and
try
them
and
then
tell
me
that
i
did
try
to
bear
them
with
a
good
grace
but
it
would
not
do
i
offended
everybody
with
my
grumbling
i
was
constantly
reminded
by
the
ladies
of
the
house
that
gentlemen
should
not
come
to
this
country
without
they
were
able
to
put
up
with
a
inconvenience
that
i
should
make
as
good
a
settler
as
a
butterfly
in
a
beehive
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
nice
about
food
and
dress
in
the
that
people
must
learn
to
eat
what
they
could
get
and
be
content
to
be
shabby
and
dirty
like
their
neighbours
in
the
until
that
horrid
word
synonymous
with
all
that
was
hateful
and
revolting
in
my
mind
it
was
impossible
to
keep
anything
to
myself
the
children
pulled
my
books
to
pieces
to
look
at
the
pictures
and
an
impudent
irish
took
my
towels
to
wipe
the
dishes
with
and
my
to
black
the
shoes
an
operation
which
she
performed
with
a
mixture
of
soot
and
grease
i
thought
i
should
be
better
off
in
a
place
of
my
own
so
i
bought
a
wild
farm
that
was
recommended
to
me
and
paid
for
it
double
what
it
was
worth
when
i
came
to
examine
my
estate
i
found
there
was
no
house
upon
it
and
i
should
have
to
wait
until
the
fall
to
get
one
put
up
and
a
few
acres
cleared
for
cultivation
i
was
glad
to
return
to
my
old
quarters
finding
nothing
to
shoot
in
the
woods
i
determined
to
amuse
myself
with
fishing
but
could
not
always
lend
his
canoe
and
there
was
no
other
to
be
had
to
pass
away
the
time
i
set
about
making
one
i
bought
an
axe
and
went
to
the
forest
to
select
a
tree
about
a
mile
from
the
lake
i
found
the
largest
pine
i
ever
saw
i
did
not
much
like
to
try
my
maiden
hand
upon
it
for
it
was
the
first
and
the
last
tree
i
ever
cut
down
but
to
it
i
went
and
i
blessed
god
that
it
reached
the
ground
without
killing
me
in
its
way
thither
when
i
was
about
it
i
thought
i
might
as
well
make
the
canoe
big
enough
but
the
bulk
of
the
tree
deceived
me
in
the
length
of
my
vessel
and
i
forgot
to
measure
the
one
that
belonged
to
it
took
me
six
weeks
hollowing
it
out
and
when
it
was
finished
it
was
as
long
as
a
and
too
unwieldy
for
all
the
oxen
in
the
township
to
draw
it
to
the
water
after
all
my
labour
my
combats
with
those
the
and
mosquitoes
my
boat
remains
a
useless
monument
of
my
industry
and
worse
than
this
the
fatigue
i
had
endured
while
working
at
it
late
and
early
brought
on
the
ague
which
so
disgusted
me
with
the
country
that
i
sold
my
farm
and
all
my
traps
for
an
old
song
purchased
bruin
to
bear
me
company
on
my
voyage
home
and
the
moment
i
am
able
to
get
rid
of
this
tormenting
fever
i
am
argument
and
remonstrance
were
alike
in
vain
he
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
his
purpose
tom
was
as
obstinate
as
his
bear
the
next
morning
he
conducted
us
to
the
stable
to
see
bruin
the
young
denizen
of
the
forest
was
tied
to
the
manger
quietly
masticating
a
cob
of
indian
corn
which
he
held
in
his
paw
and
looked
half
human
as
he
sat
upon
his
haunches
regarding
us
with
a
solemn
melancholy
air
there
was
an
extraordinary
likeness
quite
ludicrous
between
tom
and
the
bear
we
said
nothing
but
exchanged
glances
tom
read
our
thoughts
yes
said
he
there
is
a
strong
resemblance
i
saw
it
when
i
bought
him
perhaps
we
are
brothers
and
taking
in
his
hand
the
chain
that
held
the
bear
he
bestowed
upon
him
sundry
fraternal
caresses
which
the
ungrateful
bruin
returned
with
low
and
savage
growls
he
ca
flatter
he
all
truth
and
sincerity
a
child
of
nature
and
worthy
to
be
my
friend
the
only
canadian
i
ever
mean
to
acknowledge
as
about
an
hour
after
this
poor
tom
was
shaking
with
ague
which
in
a
few
days
reduced
him
so
low
that
i
began
to
think
he
never
would
see
his
native
shores
again
he
bore
the
affliction
very
philosophically
and
all
his
well
days
he
spent
with
us
one
day
my
husband
was
absent
having
accompanied
s
to
inspect
a
farm
which
he
afterwards
purchased
and
i
had
to
get
through
the
long
day
at
the
inn
in
the
best
manner
i
could
the
local
papers
were
soon
exhausted
at
that
period
they
possessed
little
or
no
interest
for
me
i
was
astonished
and
disgusted
at
the
abusive
manner
in
which
they
were
written
the
freedom
of
the
press
being
enjoyed
to
an
extent
in
this
province
unknown
in
more
civilised
communities
men
in
canada
may
call
one
another
rogues
and
miscreants
in
the
most
approved
billingsgate
through
the
medium
of
the
newspapers
which
are
a
sort
of
to
let
off
all
the
bad
feelings
and
malignant
passions
floating
through
the
country
without
any
dread
of
the
horsewhip
hence
it
is
the
commonest
thing
in
the
world
to
hear
one
editor
abusing
like
a
pickpocket
an
opposition
brother
calling
him
a
reptile
a
crawling
thing
a
calumniator
a
hired
vendor
of
lies
and
his
paper
a
a
vile
engine
of
corruption
as
base
and
degraded
as
the
proprietor
of
this
description
was
the
paper
i
now
held
in
my
hand
which
had
the
impudence
to
style
itself
the
reformer
not
of
morals
or
manners
certainly
if
one
might
judge
by
the
vulgar
abuse
that
defiled
every
page
of
the
precious
document
i
soon
flung
it
from
me
thinking
it
worthy
of
the
fate
of
many
a
better
production
in
the
olden
times
that
of
being
burned
by
the
common
hangman
but
happily
the
office
of
hangman
has
become
obsolete
in
canada
and
the
editors
of
these
refined
journals
may
go
on
abusing
their
betters
with
impunity
books
i
had
none
and
i
wished
that
tom
would
make
his
appearance
and
amuse
me
with
his
oddities
but
he
had
suffered
so
much
from
the
ague
the
day
before
that
when
he
did
enter
the
room
to
lead
me
to
dinner
he
looked
like
a
walking
corpse
the
dead
among
the
living
so
dark
so
livid
so
melancholy
it
was
really
painful
to
look
upon
him
i
hope
the
ladies
who
frequent
the
ordinary
wo
fall
in
love
with
me
said
he
grinning
at
himself
in
the
miserable
that
formed
the
case
of
the
yankee
clock
and
was
ostentatiously
displayed
on
a
side
table
i
look
quite
killing
what
a
comfort
it
is
m
to
be
above
all
in
the
middle
of
dinner
the
company
was
disturbed
by
the
entrance
of
a
person
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
but
who
was
evidently
much
flustered
with
drinking
he
thrust
his
chair
in
between
two
gentlemen
who
sat
near
the
head
of
the
table
and
in
a
loud
voice
demanded
fish
fish
sir
said
the
obsequious
waiter
a
great
favourite
with
all
persons
who
frequented
the
hotel
there
is
no
fish
sir
there
was
a
fine
salmon
sir
had
you
come
sooner
but
is
all
eaten
then
fetch
me
i
see
what
i
can
do
sir
said
the
obliging
tim
hurrying
out
tom
wilson
was
at
the
head
of
the
table
carving
a
roast
pig
and
was
in
the
act
of
helping
a
lady
when
the
rude
fellow
thrust
his
fork
into
the
pig
calling
out
as
he
did
so
hold
sir
give
me
some
of
that
pig
you
have
eaten
among
you
all
the
fish
and
now
you
are
going
to
appropriate
the
best
parts
of
the
tom
raised
his
eyebrows
and
stared
at
the
stranger
in
his
peculiar
manner
then
very
coolly
placed
the
whole
of
the
pig
on
his
plate
i
have
heard
he
said
of
dog
eating
dog
but
i
never
before
saw
pig
eating
sir
do
you
mean
to
insult
me
cried
the
stranger
his
face
crimsoning
with
anger
only
to
tell
you
sir
that
you
are
no
gentleman
here
tim
turning
to
the
waiter
go
to
the
stable
and
bring
in
my
bear
we
will
place
him
at
the
table
to
teach
this
man
how
to
behave
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
general
uproar
ensued
the
women
left
the
table
while
the
entrance
of
the
bear
threw
the
gentlemen
present
into
convulsions
of
laughter
it
was
too
much
for
the
human
biped
he
was
forced
to
leave
the
room
and
succumb
to
the
bear
my
husband
concluded
his
purchase
of
the
farm
and
invited
wilson
to
go
with
us
into
the
country
and
try
if
change
of
air
would
be
beneficial
to
him
for
in
his
then
weak
state
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
england
his
funds
were
getting
very
low
and
tom
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
leaving
bruin
in
the
charge
of
tim
who
delighted
in
the
oddities
of
the
strange
english
gentleman
tom
made
one
of
our
party
to
the
lament
of
a
canadian
emigrant
though
distant
in
spirit
still
present
to
me
my
best
thoughts
my
country
still
linger
with
thee
my
fond
heart
beats
quick
and
my
dim
eyes
run
when
i
muse
on
the
last
glance
i
gave
to
thy
shore
the
chill
mists
of
night
round
thy
white
cliffs
were
curl
but
i
felt
there
was
no
spot
like
thee
in
the
world
no
home
to
which
memory
so
fondly
would
turn
no
thought
that
within
me
so
madly
would
burn
but
one
stood
beside
me
whose
presence
the
deep
pang
of
sorrow
that
troubled
my
breast
and
the
babe
on
my
bosom
so
calmly
reclining
check
the
tears
as
they
rose
and
all
useless
repining
hard
indeed
was
the
struggle
from
thee
forced
to
roam
but
for
their
sakes
i
quitted
both
country
and
home
bless
isle
of
the
free
i
must
view
thee
no
more
my
fortunes
are
cast
on
this
shore
in
the
depths
of
dark
forests
my
soul
droops
her
wings
in
tall
boughs
above
me
no
merry
bird
sings
the
sigh
of
the
wild

the
rush
of
the
floods

the
only
sad
music
that
wakens

still
hails
thy

chapter
v
our
first
settlement
and
the
borrowing
system
to
lend
or
not
to
lend
is
that
the
question
those
who
go
go
saith
the
old
adage
and
a
wiser
saw
never
came
out
of
the
mouth
of
experience
i
have
tested
the
truth
of
this
proverb
since
my
settlement
in
canada
many
many
times
to
my
cost
and
what
emigrant
has
not
so
averse
have
i
ever
been
to
this
practice
that
i
would
at
all
times
rather
quietly
submit
to
a
temporary
inconvenience
than
obtain
anything
i
wanted
in
this
manner
i
verily
believe
that
a
demon
of
mischief
presides
over
borrowed
goods
and
takes
a
wicked
pleasure
in
playing
off
a
thousand
malicious
pranks
upon
you
the
moment
he
enters
your
dwelling
plates
and
dishes
that
had
been
the
pride
and
ornament
of
their
own
cupboard
for
years
no
sooner
enter
upon
foreign
service
than
they
are
broken
and
tumblers
that
have
been
handled
by
a
hundred
careless
wenches
in
safety
scarcely
pass
into
the
hands
of
your
servants
when
they
are
sure
to
tumble
upon
the
floor
and
the
accident
turns
out
a
compound
fracture
if
you
borrow
a
garment
of
any
kind
be
sure
that
you
will
tear
it
a
watch
that
you
will
break
it
a
jewel
that
you
will
lose
it
a
book
that
it
will
be
stolen
from
you
there
is
no
end
to
the
trouble
and
vexation
arising
out
of
this
evil
habit
if
you
borrow
a
horse
and
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
animal
in
the
district
you
no
sooner
become
responsible
for
his
conduct
than
he
loses
his
character
the
moment
that
you
attempt
to
drive
him
he
shows
that
he
has
a
will
of
his
own
by
taking
the
reins
into
his
own
management
and
running
away
in
a
contrary
direction
to
the
road
that
you
wished
him
to
travel
he
never
gives
over
his
eccentric
capers
until
he
has
broken
his
own
knees
and
the
borrowed
carriage
and
harness
so
anxious
are
you
about
his
safety
that
you
have
not
a
moment
to
bestow
upon
your
own
and
why
the
beast
is
borrowed
and
you
are
expected
to
return
him
in
as
good
condition
as
he
came
to
you
but
of
all
evils
to
borrow
money
is
perhaps
the
worst
if
of
a
friend
he
ceases
to
be
one
the
moment
you
feel
that
you
are
bound
to
him
by
the
heavy
clog
of
obligation
if
of
a
usurer
the
interest
in
this
country
soon
doubles
the
original
sum
and
you
owe
an
increasing
debt
which
in
time
swallows
up
all
you
possess
when
we
first
came
to
the
colony
nothing
surprised
me
more
than
the
extent
to
which
this
pernicious
custom
was
carried
both
by
the
native
canadians
the
european
settlers
and
the
lower
order
of
americans
many
of
the
latter
had
spied
out
the
goodness
of
the
land
and
various
portions
of
it
without
so
much
as
asking
leave
of
the
absentee
owners
unfortunately
our
new
home
was
surrounded
by
these
odious
squatters
whom
we
found
as
ignorant
as
savages
without
their
courtesy
and
kindness
the
place
we
first
occupied
was
purchased
of
b
a
merchant
who
took
it
in
payment
of
sundry
large
debts
which
the
owner
a
new
england
loyalist
had
been
unable
to
settle
old
joe
r
the
present
occupant
had
promised
to
quit
it
with
his
family
at
the
commencement
of
sleighing
and
as
the
bargain
was
concluded
in
the
month
of
september
and
we
were
anxious
to
plough
for
fall
wheat
it
was
necessary
to
be
upon
the
spot
no
house
was
to
be
found
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
save
a
small
dilapidated
log
tenement
on
an
adjoining
farm
which
was
scarcely
reclaimed
from
the
bush
that
had
been
some
months
without
an
owner
the
merchant
assured
is
that
this
could
be
made
very
comfortable
until
such
time
as
it
suited
r
to
remove
and
the
owner
was
willing
to
let
us
have
it
for
the
moderate
sum
of
four
dollars
a
month
trusting
to
b
word
and
being
strangers
in
the
land
we
never
took
the
precaution
to
examine
this
delightful
summer
residence
before
entering
upon
it
but
thought
ourselves
very
fortunate
in
obtaining
a
temporary
home
so
near
our
own
property
the
distance
not
exceeding
half
a
mile
the
agreement
was
drawn
up
and
we
were
told
that
we
could
take
possession
whenever
it
suited
us
the
few
weeks
that
i
had
sojourned
in
the
country
had
by
no
means
prepossessed
me
in
its
favour
the
was
sore
upon
me
and
all
my
solitary
hours
were
spent
in
tears
my
whole
soul
yielded
itself
up
to
a
strong
and
overpowering
grief
one
simple
word
dwelt
for
ever
in
my
heart
and
swelled
it
to
bursting
home
i
repeated
it
waking
a
thousand
times
a
day
and
my
last
prayer
before
i
sank
to
sleep
was
still
home
oh
that
i
could
return
if
only
to
die
at
home
and
nightly
i
did
return
my
feet
again
trod
the
daisied
meadows
of
england
the
song
of
her
birds
was
in
my
ears
i
wept
with
delight
to
find
myself
once
more
wandering
beneath
the
fragrant
shade
of
her
green
and
i
awoke
to
weep
in
earnest
when
i
found
it
but
a
dream
but
this
is
all
digression
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
unseen
dwelling
the
reader
must
bear
with
me
in
my
fits
of
melancholy
and
take
me
as
i
am
it
was
the
september
that
we
left
the
hotel
to
take
possession
of
our
new
abode
during
the
three
weeks
we
had
sojourned
at
i
had
not
seen
a
drop
of
rain
and
i
began
to
think
that
the
fine
weather
would
last
for
ever
but
this
eventful
day
arose
in
clouds
moodie
had
hired
a
covered
carriage
to
convey
the
baby
the
and
myself
to
the
farm
as
our
driver
prognosticated
a
wet
day
while
he
followed
with
tom
wilson
and
the
teams
that
conveyed
our
luggage
the
scenery
through
which
we
were
passing
was
so
new
to
me
so
unlike
anything
that
i
had
ever
beheld
before
that
in
spite
of
its
monotonous
character
it
won
me
from
my
melancholy
and
i
began
to
look
about
me
with
considerable
interest
not
so
my
english
servant
who
declared
that
the
woods
were
frightful
to
look
upon
that
it
was
a
country
only
fit
for
wild
beasts
that
she
hated
it
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
would
go
back
as
soon
as
she
was
able
about
a
mile
from
the
place
of
our
destination
the
rain
began
to
fall
in
torrents
and
the
air
which
had
been
balmy
as
a
spring
morning
turned
as
chilly
as
that
of
a
november
day
hannah
shivered
the
baby
cried
and
i
drew
my
summer
shawl
as
closely
round
as
possible
to
protect
her
from
the
sudden
change
in
our
hitherto
delightful
temperature
just
then
the
carriage
turned
into
a
narrow
steep
path
overhung
with
lofty
woods
and
after
labouring
up
it
with
considerable
difficulty
and
at
the
risk
of
breaking
our
necks
it
brought
us
at
length
to
a
rocky
upland
clearing
partially
covered
with
a
second
growth
of
timber
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
dark
forest
i
guess
quoth
our
yankee
driver
that
at
the
bottom
of
this
swell
you
find
yourself
to
hum
and
plunging
into
a
short
path
cut
through
the
wood
he
pointed
to
a
miserable
hut
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
descent
and
cracking
his
whip
exclaimed
is
a
smart
location
that
i
wish
you
britishers
may
enjoy
i
gazed
upon
the
place
in
perfect
dismay
for
i
had
never
seen
such
a
shed
called
a
house
before
you
must
be
mistaken
that
is
not
a
house
but
a
or
the
man
turned
his
knowing
keen
eye
upon
me
and
smiled
as
he
said
you
were
raised
in
the
old
country
i
guess
you
have
much
to
learn
and
more
perhaps
than
you
like
to
know
before
the
winter
is
i
was
perfectly
bewildered
i
could
only
stare
at
the
place
with
my
eyes
swimming
in
tears
but
as
the
horses
plunged
down
into
the
broken
hollow
my
attention
was
drawn
from
my
new
residence
to
the
perils
which
endangered
life
and
limb
at
every
step
the
driver
however
was
well
used
to
such
roads
and
steering
us
dexterously
between
the
black
stumps
at
length
drove
up
not
to
the
door
for
there
was
none
to
the
house
but
to
the
open
space
from
which
that
absent
but
very
necessary
appendage
had
been
removed
three
young
steers
and
two
heifers
which
the
driver
proceeded
to
drive
out
were
quietly
reposing
upon
the
floor
a
few
strokes
of
his
whip
and
a
loud
burst
of
gratuitous
curses
soon
effected
an
ejectment
and
i
dismounted
and
took
possession
of
this
untenable
tenement
moodie
was
not
yet
in
sight
with
the
teams
i
begged
the
man
to
stay
until
he
arrived
as
i
felt
terrified
at
being
left
alone
in
this
wild
place
he
laughed
as
well
he
might
at
our
fears
and
said
that
he
had
a
long
way
to
go
and
must
be
off
then
cracking
his
whip
and
nodding
to
the
girl
who
was
crying
aloud
he
went
his
way
and
hannah
and
myself
were
left
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
dirty
floor
the
prospect
was
indeed
dreary
without
pouring
rain
within
a
fireless
hearth
a
room
with
but
one
window
and
that
containing
only
one
whole
pane
of
glass
not
an
article
of
furniture
to
be
seen
save
an
old
painted
cradle
which
had
been
left
there
by
some
freak
of
fortune
this
turned
upon
its
side
served
us
for
a
seat
and
there
we
impatiently
awaited
the
arrival
of
moodie
wilson
and
a
man
whom
the
former
had
hired
that
morning
to
assist
on
the
farm
where
they
were
all
to
be
stowed
might
have
puzzled
a
more
sagacious
brain
than
mine
it
is
true
there
was
a
loft
but
i
could
see
no
way
of
reaching
it
for
ladder
there
was
none
so
we
amused
ourselves
while
waiting
for
the
coming
of
our
party
by
abusing
the
place
the
country
and
our
own
dear
selves
for
our
folly
in
coming
to
it
now
when
not
only
reconciled
to
canada
but
loving
it
and
feeling
a
deep
interest
in
its
present
welfare
and
the
fair
prospect
of
its
future
greatness
i
often
look
back
and
laugh
at
the
feelings
with
which
i
then
regarded
this
noble
country
when
things
come
to
the
worst
they
generally
mend
the
males
of
our
party
no
sooner
arrived
than
they
set
about
making
things
more
comfortable
james
our
servant
pulled
up
some
of
the
decayed
stumps
with
which
the
small
clearing
that
surrounded
the
shanty
was
thickly
covered
and
made
a
fire
and
hannah
roused
herself
from
the
stupor
of
despair
and
seized
the
from
the
top
of
the
loaded
waggon
and
began
to
sweep
the
house
raising
such
an
intolerable
cloud
of
dust
that
i
was
glad
to
throw
my
cloak
over
my
head
and
run
out
of
doors
to
avoid
suffocation
then
commenced
the
awful
bustle
of
unloading
the
two
waggons
the
small
space
within
the
house
was
soon
entirely
blocked
up
with
trunks
and
packages
of
all
descriptions
there
was
scarcely
room
to
move
without
stumbling
over
some
article
of
household
stuff
the
rain
poured
in
at
the
open
door
beat
in
at
the
shattered
window
and
dropped
upon
our
heads
from
the
holes
in
the
roof
the
wind
blew
keenly
through
a
thousand
apertures
in
the
log
walls
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
uncomfortableness
of
our
situation
for
a
long
time
the
box
which
contained
a
hammer
and
nails
was
not
to
be
found
at
length
hannah
discovered
it
tied
up
with
some
bedding
which
she
was
opening
out
in
order
to
dry
i
fortunately
spied
the
door
lying
among
some
old
boards
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
moodie
immediately
commenced
fitting
it
to
its
place
this
once
accomplished
was
a
great
addition
to
our
comfort
we
then
nailed
a
piece
of
white
cloth
entirely
over
the
broken
window
which
without
diminishing
the
light
kept
out
the
rain
james
constructed
a
ladder
out
of
the
old
bits
of
boards
and
tom
wilson
assisted
him
in
stowing
the
luggage
away
in
the
loft
but
what
has
this
picture
of
misery
and
discomfort
to
do
with
borrowing
patience
my
dear
good
friends
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
while
we
were
all
busily
employed
even
the
poor
baby
who
was
lying
upon
a
pillow
in
the
old
cradle
trying
the
strength
of
her
lungs
and
not
a
little
irritated
that
no
one
was
at
leisure
to
regard
her
laudable
endeavours
to
make
herself
heard
the
door
was
suddenly
pushed
open
and
the
apparition
of
a
woman
squeezed
itself
into
the
crowded
room
i
left
off
arranging
the
furniture
of
a
bed
that
had
been
just
put
up
in
a
corner
to
meet
my
unexpected
and
at
that
moment
not
very
welcome
guest
her
whole
appearance
was
so
extraordinary
that
i
felt
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
address
her
imagine
a
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
with
sharp
features
a
forward
impudent
carriage
and
a
pert
flippant
voice
standing
upon
one
of
the
trunks
and
surveying
all
our
proceedings
in
the
most
impertinent
manner
the
creature
was
dressed
in
a
ragged
dirty
purple
stuff
gown
cut
very
low
in
the
neck
with
an
old
red
cotton
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
her
uncombed
tangled
locks
falling
over
her
thin
inquisitive
face
in
a
state
of
perfect
nature
her
legs
and
feet
were
bare
and
in
her
coarse
dirty
red
hands
she
swung
to
and
fro
an
empty
glass
decanter
what
can
she
want
i
asked
myself
what
a
strange
creature
and
there
she
stood
staring
at
me
in
the
most
unceremonious
manner
her
keen
black
eyes
glancing
obliquely
to
every
corner
of
the
room
which
she
examined
with
critical
exactness
before
i
could
speak
to
her
she
commenced
the
conversation
by
drawling
through
her
nose
well
i
guess
you
are
fixing
i
thought
she
had
come
to
offer
her
services
and
i
told
her
that
i
did
not
want
a
girl
for
i
had
brought
one
out
with
me
how
responded
the
creature
i
hope
you
do
take
me
for
a
help
i
have
you
to
know
that
i
as
good
a
lady
as
yourself
no
i
just
stepped
over
to
see
what
was
going
on
i
seed
the
teams
pass
about
noon
and
i
says
to
father
strangers
are
cum
i
go
and
look
arter
them
says
he
and
take
the
decanter
along
may
be
they
want
one
to
put
their
whiskey
in
goin
to
says
i
so
i
cum
across
with
it
an
here
it
is
but
mind
do
break
it
is
the
only
one
we
have
to
hum
and
father
says
is
so
mean
to
drink
out
of
green
my
surprise
increased
every
minute
it
seemed
such
an
act
of
disinterested
generosity
thus
to
anticipate
wants
we
had
never
thought
of
i
was
regularly
taken
in
my
good
girl
i
began
this
is
really
very
kind
but
now
do
go
to
call
me
and
pass
off
your
english
airs
on
us
we
are
yankees
and
think
ourselves
as
good
yes
a
great
deal
better
than
you
i
am
a
young
indeed
said
i
striving
to
repress
my
astonishment
i
am
a
stranger
in
the
country
and
my
acquaintance
with
canadian
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
very
small
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
by
using
the
term
girl
i
was
going
to
assure
you
that
we
had
no
need
of
the
decanter
we
have
bottles
of
our
own
and
we
do
drink
how
not
drink
whiskey
why
you
do
say
how
ignorant
you
must
be
may
be
they
have
no
whiskey
in
the
old
country
yes
we
have
but
it
is
not
like
the
canadian
whiskey
but
pray
take
the
decanter
home
again
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
get
broken
in
this
no
no
father
told
me
to
leave
it
and
there
it
is
and
she
planted
it
resolutely
down
on
the
trunk
you
will
find
a
use
for
it
till
you
have
unpacked
your
seeing
that
she
was
determined
to
leave
the
bottle
i
said
no
more
about
it
but
asked
her
to
tell
me
where
the
well
was
to
be
found
the
well
she
repeated
after
me
with
a
sneer
who
thinks
of
digging
wells
when
they
can
get
plenty
of
water
from
the
creek
there
is
a
fine
water
privilege
not
a
from
the
door
and
jumping
off
the
box
she
disappeared
as
abruptly
as
she
had
entered
we
all
looked
at
each
other
tom
wilson
was
highly
amused
and
laughed
until
he
held
his
sides
what
tempted
her
to
bring
this
empty
bottle
here
said
moodie
it
is
all
an
excuse
the
visit
tom
was
meant
for
you
know
more
about
it
in
a
few
days
said
james
looking
up
from
his
work
that
bottle
is
not
brought
here
for
i
could
not
unravel
the
mystery
and
thought
no
more
about
it
until
it
was
again
brought
to
my
recollection
by
the
damsel
herself
our
united
efforts
had
effected
a
complete
transformation
in
our
uncouth
dwelling
had
been
partitioned
off
for
the
men
shelves
had
been
put
up
for
the
accommodation
of
books
and
crockery
a
carpet
covered
the
floor
and
the
chairs
and
tables
we
had
brought
from
gave
an
air
of
comfort
to
the
place
which
on
the
first
view
of
it
i
deemed
impossible
my
husband
wilson
and
james
had
walked
over
to
inspect
the
farm
and
i
was
sitting
at
the
table
at
work
the
baby
creeping
upon
the
floor
and
hannah
preparing
dinner
the
sun
shone
warm
and
bright
and
the
open
door
admitted
a
current
of
fresh
air
which
tempered
the
heat
of
the
fire
well
i
guess
you
look
smart
said
the
yankee
damsel
presenting
herself
once
more
before
me
you
old
country
folks
are
so
stiff
you
must
have
every
thing
nice
or
you
fret
but
then
you
can
easily
do
it
you
have
stacks
of
money
and
you
can
fix
everything
right
off
with
pray
take
a
seat
and
i
offered
her
a
chair
and
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
your
name
i
suppose
you
must
live
in
the
neighbourhood
although
i
can
not
perceive
any
dwelling
near
my
name
so
you
want
to
know
my
name
i
ar
ashamed
of
my
own
emily
s
i
am
eldest
daughter
to
the
who
owns
this
what
must
the
father
be
thought
i
if
he
resembles
the
young
his
daughter
imagine
a
young
lady
dressed
in
ragged
petticoats
through
whose
yawning
rents
peeped
forth
from
time
to
time
her
bare
red
knees
with
uncombed
and
a
face
and
hands
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
unwashed
for
a
month
who
did
not
know
a
from
b
and
despised
those
who
did
while
these
reflections
combined
with
a
thousand
ludicrous
images
were
flitting
through
my
mind
my
strange
visitor
suddenly
exclaimed
have
you
done
with
that
decanter
i
brought
across
yesterday
oh
yes
i
have
no
occasion
for
i
rose
took
it
from
the
shelf
and
placed
it
in
her
hand
i
guess
you
wo
return
it
empty
that
would
be
mean
father
says
he
wants
it
filled
with
the
mystery
was
solved
the
riddle
made
clear
i
could
contain
my
gravity
no
longer
but
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
in
which
i
was
joined
by
hannah
our
young
lady
was
mortally
offended
she
tossed
the
decanter
from
hand
to
hand
and
glared
at
us
with
her
eyes
you
think
yourselves
smart
why
do
you
laugh
in
that
way
excuse
me
but
you
have
such
an
odd
way
of
borrowing
that
i
can
not
help
it
this
bottle
it
seems
was
brought
over
for
your
own
convenience
not
for
mine
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
i
have
no
i
guess
spirits
will
do
as
well
i
know
there
is
some
in
that
keg
for
i
smells
it
contains
rum
for
the
better
still
i
calculate
when
you
been
here
a
few
months
you
be
too
knowing
to
give
rum
to
your
helps
but
old
country
folks
are
all
fools
and
that
the
reason
they
get
so
easily
sucked
in
and
be
so
soon
cum
fill
the
bottle
and
do
be
stingy
in
this
country
we
all
live
by
borrowing
if
you
want
anything
why
just
send
and
borrow
from
thinking
that
this
might
be
the
custom
of
the
country
i
hastened
to
fill
the
decanter
hoping
that
i
might
get
a
little
new
milk
for
the
poor
weanling
child
in
return
but
when
i
asked
my
liberal
visitor
if
she
kept
cows
and
would
lend
me
a
little
new
milk
for
the
baby
she
burst
out
into
high
disdain
milk
lend
milk
i
guess
milk
in
the
fall
is
worth
a
york
shilling
a
quart
i
can
not
sell
you
a
drop
this
was
a
wicked
piece
of
extortion
as
the
same
article
in
the
town
where
of
course
it
was
in
greater
request
only
brought
the
quart
if
you
pay
me
for
it
i
bring
you
some
but
mind
cash
and
when
do
you
mean
to
return
the
rum
i
said
with
some
asperity
when
father
goes
to
the
this
was
the
name
given
by
my
neighbours
to
the
village
of
p
distant
about
four
miles
day
after
day
i
was
tormented
by
this
importunate
creature
she
borrowed
of
me
tea
sugar
candles
starch
blueing
irons
pots
bowls
in
short
every
article
in
common
domestic
use
while
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
we
could
get
them
returned
articles
of
food
such
as
tea
and
sugar
or
of
convenience
like
candles
starch
and
soap
she
never
dreamed
of
being
required
at
her
hands
this
method
of
living
upon
their
neighbours
is
a
most
convenient
one
to
unprincipled
people
as
it
does
not
involve
the
penalty
of
stealing
and
they
can
keep
the
goods
without
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
returning
them
or
feeling
the
moral
obligation
of
being
grateful
for
their
use
living
eight
miles
from
i
found
these
constant
encroachments
a
heavy
burden
on
our
poor
purse
and
being
ignorant
of
the
country
and
residing
in
such
a
lonely
place
surrounded
by
these
savages
i
was
really
afraid
of
denying
their
requests
the
very
day
our
new
plough
came
home
the
father
of
this
bright
damsel
who
went
by
the
familiar
and
unenviable
title
of
old
satan
came
over
to
borrow
it
though
we
afterwards
found
out
that
he
had
a
good
one
of
his
own
the
land
had
never
been
broken
up
and
was
full
of
rocks
and
stumps
and
he
was
anxious
to
save
his
own
from
injury
the
consequence
was
that
the
borrowed
implement
came
home
unfit
for
use
just
at
the
very
time
that
we
wanted
to
plough
for
fall
wheat
the
same
happened
to
a
spade
and
trowel
bought
in
order
to
plaster
the
house
satan
asked
the
loan
of
them
for
hour
for
the
same
purpose
and
we
never
saw
them
again
the
daughter
came
one
morning
as
usual
on
one
of
these
swindling
expeditions
and
demanded
of
me
the
loan
of
some
fine
slack
not
knowing
what
she
meant
by
fine
slack
and
weary
of
her
importunities
i
said
i
had
none
she
went
away
in
a
rage
shortly
after
she
came
again
for
some
pepper
i
was
at
work
and
my
was
open
upon
the
table
well
stored
with
threads
and
spools
of
all
descriptions
miss
satan
cast
her
hawk
eye
into
it
and
burst
out
in
her
usual
rude
manner
i
guess
you
told
me
a
tarnation
big
lie
the
other
unaccustomed
to
such
language
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
pointing
to
the
door
told
her
to
walk
out
as
i
did
not
choose
to
be
insulted
in
my
own
house
your
house
i
sure
it
father
returned
the
incorrigible
wretch
you
told
me
that
you
had
no
fine
slack
and
you
have
stacks
of
what
is
fine
slack
said
i
very
pettishly
the
stuff
that
wound
upon
these
pieces
of
wood
pouncing
as
she
spoke
upon
one
of
my
most
serviceable
spools
i
can
not
give
you
that
i
want
it
i
did
ask
you
to
give
it
i
only
wants
to
borrow
it
till
father
goes
to
the
i
wish
he
would
make
haste
then
as
i
want
a
number
of
things
which
you
have
borrowed
of
me
and
which
i
can
not
longer
do
she
gave
me
a
knowing
look
and
carried
off
my
spool
in
triumph
i
happened
to
mention
the
manner
in
which
i
was
constantly
annoyed
by
these
people
to
a
worthy
english
farmer
who
resided
near
us
and
he
fell
and
told
me
that
i
did
not
know
the
canadian
yankees
as
well
as
he
did
or
i
should
not
be
troubled
with
them
long
the
best
way
says
he
to
get
rid
of
them
is
to
ask
them
sharply
what
they
want
and
if
they
give
you
no
satisfactory
answer
order
them
to
leave
the
house
but
i
believe
i
can
put
you
in
a
better
way
still
buy
some
small
article
of
them
and
pay
them
a
trifle
over
the
price
and
tell
them
to
bring
the
change
i
will
lay
my
life
upon
it
that
it
will
be
long
before
they
trouble
you
i
was
impatient
to
test
the
efficacy
of
his
scheme
that
very
afternoon
miss
satan
brought
me
a
plate
of
butter
for
sale
the
price
was
three
and
ninepence
twice
the
sum
that
it
was
worth
i
have
no
change
giving
her
a
dollar
but
you
can
bring
it
me
oh
blessed
experiment
for
the
value
of
one
quarter
dollar
i
got
rid
of
this
dishonest
girl
for
ever
rather
than
pay
me
she
never
entered
the
house
again
about
a
month
after
this
i
was
busy
making
an
in
the
kitchen
a
woman
very
and
popped
her
visage
into
the
door
and
drawled
through
her
nose
do
you
want
to
buy
a
rooster
now
the
with
which
we
had
been
regaled
every
day
for
three
weeks
at
the
tavern
were
called
roasters
and
not
understanding
the
familiar
phrases
of
the
country
i
thought
she
had
a
to
sell
is
it
a
good
one
i
guess
is
what
do
you
ask
for
it
two
that
is
very
cheap
if
it
is
any
weight
i
do
like
them
under
ten
or
twelve
ten
or
twelve
pounds
why
woman
what
do
you
mean
would
you
expect
a
rooster
to
be
bigger
nor
a
turkey
we
stared
at
each
other
there
was
evidently
some
misconception
on
my
part
bring
the
roaster
up
and
if
i
like
it
i
will
buy
it
though
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
very
fond
of
roast
do
you
call
this
a
pig
said
my
drawing
a
fine
from
under
her
cloak
i
laughed
heartily
at
my
mistake
as
i
paid
her
down
the
money
for
the
bonny
bird
this
little
matter
settled
i
thought
she
would
take
her
departure
but
that
rooster
proved
the
dearest
fowl
to
me
that
ever
was
bought
do
you
keep
backy
and
snuff
here
says
she
sideling
close
up
to
me
we
make
no
use
of
those
how
not
use
backy
and
snuff
that
she
paused
then
added
in
a
mysterious
confidential
tone
i
want
to
ask
you
how
your
stands
it
stands
in
the
cupboard
said
i
wondering
what
all
this
might
mean
i
know
that
but
have
you
any
tea
to
spare
i
now
began
to
suspect
what
sort
of
a
customer
the
stranger
was
oh
you
want
to
borrow
some
i
have
none
to
you
do
say
so
well
now
that
stingy
i
never
asked
anything
of
you
before
i
am
poor
and
you
are
rich
besides
i
troubled
so
with
the
headache
and
nothing
does
me
any
good
but
a
cup
of
strong
the
money
i
have
just
given
you
will
buy
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
the
i
guess
that
is
mine
the
fowl
belonged
to
my
neighbour
sick
and
i
promised
to
sell
it
for
her
to
buy
some
physic
money
she
added
in
a
coaxing
tone
where
should
i
get
money
lord
bless
you
people
in
this
country
have
no
money
and
those
who
come
out
with
piles
of
it
soon
lose
it
but
emily
s
told
me
that
you
are
tarnation
rich
and
draw
your
money
from
the
old
country
so
i
guess
you
can
well
afford
to
lend
a
neighbour
a
spoonful
of
neighbour
where
do
you
live
and
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
betty
fye
old
betty
fye
i
live
in
the
log
shanty
over
the
creek
at
the
back
of
the
farm
belongs
to
my
eldest
son
i
a
widow
with
twelve
sons
and
is
hard
to
scratch
do
you
swear
swear
what
harm
it
eases
one
mind
when
one
vexed
everybody
swears
in
this
country
my
boys
all
swear
like
sam
hill
and
i
used
to
swear
mighty
big
oaths
till
about
a
month
ago
when
the
methody
parson
told
me
that
if
i
did
not
leave
it
off
i
should
go
to
a
tarnation
bad
place
so
i
dropped
some
of
the
worst
of
you
would
do
wisely
to
drop
the
rest
women
never
swear
in
my
well
you
do
say
i
always
heer
they
were
very
ignorant
will
you
lend
me
the
tea
the
woman
was
such
an
original
that
i
gave
her
what
she
wanted
as
she
was
going
off
she
took
up
one
of
the
apples
i
was
peeling
i
guess
you
have
a
fine
orchard
they
say
the
best
in
the
we
have
no
orchard
to
hum
and
i
guess
you
want
sarce
what
is
sarce
not
know
what
sarce
is
you
are
clever
sarce
is
apples
cut
up
and
dried
to
make
into
pies
in
the
winter
now
do
you
comprehend
i
nodded
well
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
have
no
apples
and
that
you
have
a
tarnation
big
few
of
them
and
if
you
give
me
twenty
bushels
of
your
best
apples
and
find
me
with
half
a
pound
of
coarse
thread
to
string
them
upon
i
will
make
you
a
barrel
of
sarce
on
shares
that
is
give
you
one
and
keep
one
for
i
had
plenty
of
apples
and
i
gladly
accepted
her
offer
and
betty
fye
departed
elated
with
the
success
of
her
expedition
i
found
to
my
cost
that
once
admitted
into
the
house
there
was
no
keeping
her
away
she
borrowed
everything
that
she
could
think
of
without
once
dreaming
of
restitution
i
tried
all
ways
of
affronting
her
but
without
success
winter
came
and
she
was
still
at
her
old
pranks
whenever
i
saw
her
coming
down
the
lane
i
used
involuntarily
to
exclaim
betty
fye
betty
fye
fye
upon
betty
fye
the
lord
deliver
me
from
betty
fye
the
last
time
i
was
honoured
with
a
visit
from
this
worthy
she
meant
to
favour
me
with
a
very
large
order
upon
my
goods
and
chattels
well
fye
what
do
you
want
so
many
things
that
i
scarce
know
where
to
begin
ah
what
a
thing
to
be
poor
first
i
want
you
to
lend
me
ten
pounds
of
flour
to
make
some
johnnie
i
thought
they
were
made
of
indian
meal
yes
yes
when
you
got
the
meal
i
out
of
it
and
this
is
a
new
fixing
of
my
own
invention
lend
me
the
flour
woman
and
bring
you
one
of
the
cakes
to
this
was
said
very
coaxingly
oh
pray
do
trouble
yourself
what
next
i
was
anxious
to
see
how
far
her
impudence
would
go
and
determined
to
affront
her
if
possible
i
want
you
to
lend
me
a
gown
and
a
pair
of
stockings
i
have
to
go
to
oswego
to
see
my
husband
sister
and
i
like
to
look
mrs
fye
i
never
lend
my
clothes
to
any
one
if
i
lent
them
to
you
i
should
never
wear
them
so
much
the
better
for
me
with
a
knowing
grin
i
guess
if
you
wo
lend
me
the
gown
you
will
let
me
have
some
black
slack
to
quilt
a
stuff
petticoat
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
and
some
sugar
and
i
will
bring
them
back
as
soon
as
i
i
wonder
when
that
will
be
you
owe
me
so
many
things
that
it
will
cost
you
more
than
you
imagine
to
repay
sure
you
not
going
to
mention
what
past
i
ca
owe
you
much
but
i
will
let
you
off
the
tea
and
the
sugar
if
you
will
lend
me
a
this
was
too
much
for
my
patience
longer
to
endure
and
i
answered
sharply
mrs
fye
it
surprises
me
that
such
proud
people
as
you
americans
should
condescend
to
the
meanness
of
borrowing
from
those
whom
you
affect
to
despise
besides
as
you
never
repay
us
for
what
you
pretend
to
borrow
i
look
upon
it
as
a
system
of
robbery
if
strangers
unfortunately
settle
among
you
their
is
taxed
to
supply
your
domestic
wants
at
a
ruinous
expense
besides
the
mortification
of
finding
that
they
have
been
deceived
and
tricked
out
of
their
property
if
you
would
come
honestly
to
me
and
say
want
these
things
i
am
too
poor
to
buy
them
myself
and
would
be
obliged
to
you
to
give
them
to
me
i
should
then
acknowledge
you
as
a
common
beggar
and
treat
you
accordingly
give
or
not
give
as
it
suited
my
convenience
but
in
the
way
in
which
you
obtain
these
articles
from
me
you
are
spared
even
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
you
well
know
that
the
many
things
which
you
have
borrowed
from
me
will
be
a
debt
owing
to
the
day
of
they
are
quoth
betty
not
in
the
least
abashed
at
my
lecture
on
honesty
you
know
what
the
scripture
saith
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
ay
there
is
an
answer
to
that
in
the
same
book
which
doubtless
you
may
have
heard
said
i
disgusted
with
her
hypocrisy
wicked
borroweth
and
payeth
not
again
never
shall
i
forget
the
furious
passion
into
which
this
too
apt
quotation
threw
my
unprincipled
applicant
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
cursed
me
using
some
of
the
big
oaths
temporarily
discarded
for
conscience
sake
and
so
she
left
me
and
i
never
looked
upon
her
face
again
when
i
removed
to
our
own
house
the
history
of
which
and
its
former
owner
i
will
give
we
had
a
bony
ruffianly
american
squatter
who
had
left
his
country
for
his
country
good
for
an
opposite
neighbour
i
had
scarcely
time
to
put
my
house
in
order
before
his
family
commenced
borrowing
or
stealing
from
me
it
is
even
worse
than
stealing
the
things
procured
from
you
being
obtained
on
false
pretences
adding
lying
to
theft
not
having
either
an
oven
or
a
cooking
stove
which
at
that
period
were
not
so
cheap
or
so
common
as
they
are
now
i
had
provided
myself
with
a
large
as
a
substitute
in
this
kettle
we
always
cooked
hot
cakes
for
breakfast
preferring
that
to
the
trouble
of
thawing
the
frozen
bread
this
man
wife
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
over
for
my
kettle
whenever
she
wanted
to
bake
which
as
she
had
a
large
family
happened
nearly
every
day
and
i
found
her
importunity
a
great
nuisance
i
told
the
impudent
lad
so
who
was
generally
sent
for
it
and
asked
him
what
they
did
to
bake
their
bread
before
i
came
i
guess
we
had
to
eat
cakes
in
the
pan
but
now
we
can
borrow
this
kettle
of
mother
can
fix
i
told
him
that
he
could
have
the
kettle
this
time
but
i
must
decline
letting
his
mother
have
it
in
future
for
i
wanted
it
for
the
same
purpose
the
next
day
passed
over
the
night
was
intensely
cold
and
i
did
not
rise
so
early
as
usual
in
the
morning
my
servant
was
away
at
a
quilting
bee
and
we
were
still
in
bed
when
i
heard
the
latch
of
the
lifted
up
and
a
step
crossed
the
floor
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
as
fast
as
i
could
when
philander
called
out
in
his
nasal
twang
missus
i
come
for
the
i
through
the
partition
you
ca
have
it
this
morning
we
can
not
get
our
breakfast
without
philander
nor
more
can
the
old
woman
to
hum
and
snatching
up
the
kettle
which
had
been
left
to
warm
on
the
hearth
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
hurrah
for
the
yankee
boys
when
james
came
home
for
his
breakfast
i
sent
him
across
to
demand
the
kettle
and
the
dame
very
coolly
told
him
that
when
she
had
done
with
it
i
have
it
but
she
defied
him
to
take
it
out
of
her
house
with
her
bread
in
it
one
word
more
about
this
lad
philander
before
we
part
with
him
without
the
least
intimation
that
his
company
would
be
agreeable
or
even
tolerated
he
favoured
us
with
it
at
all
hours
of
the
day
opening
the
door
and
walking
in
and
out
whenever
he
felt
inclined
i
had
given
him
many
broad
hints
that
his
presence
was
not
required
but
he
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
what
i
said
one
morning
he
marched
in
with
his
hat
on
and
threw
himself
down
in
the
just
as
i
was
going
to
dress
my
baby
philander
i
want
to
attend
to
the
child
i
can
not
do
it
with
you
here
will
you
oblige
me
by
going
into
the
kitchen
no
answer
he
seldom
spoke
during
these
visits
but
wandered
about
the
room
turning
over
our
books
and
papers
looking
at
and
handling
everything
nay
i
have
even
known
him
to
take
a
lid
off
from
the
pot
on
the
fire
to
examine
its
contents
i
repeated
my
request
philander
well
i
guess
i
sha
hurt
the
young
you
can
dress
i
but
not
with
you
philander
why
not
never
do
anything
that
we
are
ashamed
i
so
it
seems
but
i
want
to
sweep
the
room
you
had
better
get
out
of
the
i
took
the
broom
from
the
corner
and
began
to
sweep
still
my
visitor
did
not
stir
the
dust
rose
in
clouds
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
moved
a
little
nearer
to
the
door
another
sweep
and
to
escape
its
inflictions
he
mounted
the
threshold
i
had
him
now
at
a
fair
advantage
and
fairly
swept
him
out
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
philander
looking
through
the
window
well
i
guess
you
did
me
then
but
is
deuced
hard
to
outwit
a
this
freed
me
from
his
company
and
he
too
never
repeated
his
visit
so
i
found
by
experience
that
once
smartly
rebuked
they
did
not
like
to
try
their
strength
with
you
a
second
time
when
a
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
for
the
drying
of
my
twenty
bushels
of
apples
i
sent
a
cornish
lad
in
our
employ
to
betty
fye
to
inquire
if
they
were
ready
and
when
i
should
send
the
cart
for
them
dan
returned
with
a
yellow
string
of
pieces
dangling
from
his
arm
thinking
that
these
were
a
specimen
of
the
whole
i
inquired
when
we
were
to
send
the
barrel
for
the
rest
lord
this
is
all
there
impossible
all
out
of
twenty
bushels
of
apples
yes
said
the
boy
with
a
grin
the
old
witch
told
me
that
this
was
all
that
was
left
of
your
share
that
when
they
were
fixed
enough
she
put
them
under
her
bed
for
safety
and
the
mice
and
the
children
had
eaten
them
all
up
but
this
this
ended
my
dealings
with
betty
fye
i
had
another
incorrigible
borrower
in
the
person
of
old
betty
b
this
betty
was
unlike
the
rest
of
my
yankee
borrowers
she
was
handsome
in
her
person
and
remarkably
civil
and
she
asked
for
the
loan
of
everything
in
such
a
frank
pleasant
manner
that
for
some
time
i
hardly
knew
how
to
refuse
her
after
i
had
been
a
loser
to
a
considerable
extent
and
declined
lending
her
any
more
she
refrained
from
coming
to
the
house
herself
but
sent
in
her
name
the
most
beautiful
boy
in
the
world
a
perfect
cherub
with
regular
features
blue
smiling
eyes
rosy
cheeks
and
lovely
curling
auburn
hair
who
said
in
the
softest
tones
imaginable
that
mammy
had
sent
him
with
her
compliments
to
the
english
lady
to
ask
the
loan
of
a
little
sugar
or
tea
i
could
easily
have
refused
the
mother
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
nay
to
her
sweet
boy
there
was
something
original
about
betty
b
and
i
must
give
a
slight
sketch
of
her
she
lived
in
a
lone
shanty
in
the
woods
which
had
been
erected
by
lumberers
some
years
before
and
which
was
destitute
of
a
single
acre
of
clearing
yet
betty
had
plenty
of
potatoes
without
the
trouble
of
planting
or
the
expense
of
buying
she
never
kept
a
cow
yet
she
sold
butter
and
milk
but
she
had
a
fashion
and
it
proved
a
convenient
one
to
her
of
making
pets
of
the
cattle
of
her
neighbours
if
our
cows
strayed
from
their
pastures
they
were
always
found
near
betty
shanty
for
she
regularly
supplied
them
with
salt
which
formed
a
sort
of
bond
of
union
between
them
and
in
return
for
these
little
attentions
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
milked
before
they
returned
to
their
respective
owners
her
mode
of
obtaining
eggs
and
fowls
was
on
the
same
economical
plan
and
we
all
looked
upon
betty
as
a
sort
of
freebooter
living
upon
the
property
of
others
she
had
had
three
husbands
and
he
with
whom
she
now
lived
was
not
her
husband
although
the
father
of
the
splendid
child
whose
beauty
so
won
upon
my
woman
heart
her
first
husband
was
still
living
a
thing
by
no
means
uncommon
among
persons
of
her
class
in
canada
and
though
they
had
quarrelled
and
parted
years
ago
he
occasionally
visited
his
wife
to
see
her
eldest
daughter
betty
the
younger
who
was
his
child
she
was
now
a
fine
girl
of
sixteen
as
beautiful
as
her
little
brother
betty
second
husband
had
been
killed
in
one
of
our
fields
by
a
tree
falling
upon
him
while
ploughing
under
it
he
was
buried
upon
the
spot
part
of
the
blackened
stump
forming
his
monument
in
truth
betty
character
was
none
of
the
best
and
many
of
the
respectable
farmers
wives
regarded
her
with
a
jealous
eye
i
am
so
jealous
of
that
nasty
betty
b
said
the
wife
of
an
irish
captain
in
the
army
and
our
near
neighbour
to
me
one
day
as
we
were
sitting
at
work
together
she
was
a
west
indian
and
a
negro
by
the
mother
side
but
an
uncommonly
mulatto
very
passionate
and
very
watchful
over
the
conduct
of
her
husband
are
you
not
afraid
of
letting
captain
moodie
go
near
her
shanty
no
indeed
and
if
i
were
so
foolish
as
to
be
jealous
it
would
not
be
of
old
betty
but
of
the
beautiful
young
betty
her
perhaps
this
was
rather
mischievous
on
my
part
for
the
poor
dark
lady
went
off
in
a
frantic
fit
of
jealousy
but
this
time
it
was
not
of
old
betty
another
american
squatter
was
always
sending
over
to
borrow
a
comb
which
she
called
a
vermin
destroyer
and
once
the
same
person
asked
the
loan
of
a
towel
as
a
friend
had
come
from
the
states
to
visit
her
and
the
only
one
she
had
had
been
made
into
a
best
pinny
for
the
child
she
likewise
begged
a
sight
in
the
as
she
wanted
to
try
on
a
new
cap
to
see
if
it
were
fixed
to
her
mind
this
woman
must
have
been
a
mirror
of
neatness
when
compared
with
her
dirty
neighbours
one
night
i
was
roused
up
from
my
bed
for
the
loan
of
a
pair
of
for
what
purpose
think
you
gentle
reader
to
weigh
a
infant
the
process
was
performed
by
tying
the
poor
squalling
thing
up
in
a
small
shawl
and
suspending
it
to
one
of
the
hooks
the
child
was
a
fine
boy
and
weighed
ten
pounds
greatly
to
the
delight
of
the
yankee
father
one
of
the
drollest
instances
of
borrowing
i
have
ever
heard
of
was
told
me
by
a
friend
a
asked
her
mistress
to
go
out
on
a
particular
afternoon
as
she
was
going
to
have
a
party
of
her
friends
and
wanted
the
loan
of
the
it
would
be
endless
to
enumerate
our
losses
in
this
way
but
fortunately
for
us
the
arrival
of
an
english
family
in
our
immediate
vicinity
drew
off
the
attention
of
our
neighbours
in
that
direction
and
left
us
time
to
recover
a
little
from
their
persecutions
this
system
of
borrowing
is
not
wholly
confined
to
the
poor
and
ignorant
it
pervades
every
class
of
society
if
a
party
is
given
in
any
of
the
small
villages
a
boy
is
sent
round
from
house
to
house
to
collect
all
the
plates
and
dishes
knives
and
forks
teaspoons
and
candlesticks
that
are
presentable
for
the
use
of
the
company
during
my
stay
at
the
hotel
i
took
a
dress
out
of
my
trunk
and
hung
it
up
upon
a
peg
in
my
chamber
in
order
to
remove
the
creases
it
had
received
from
close
packing
returning
from
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
i
found
a
note
upon
my
dressing
table
inviting
us
to
spend
the
evening
with
a
clergyman
family
in
the
village
and
as
it
was
nearly
time
to
dress
i
went
to
the
peg
to
take
down
my
gown
was
it
a
dream
the
gown
was
gone
i
the
trunk
to
see
if
i
had
replaced
it
i
searched
every
corner
of
the
room
but
all
in
vain
nowhere
could
i
discover
the
thing
i
sought
what
had
become
of
it
the
question
was
a
delicate
one
which
i
did
not
like
to
put
to
the
young
ladies
of
the
truly
respectable
establishment
still
the
loss
was
great
and
at
that
moment
very
inconvenient
while
i
was
deliberating
on
what
course
to
pursue
miss
s
entered
the
room
i
guess
you
missed
your
dress
she
said
with
a
smile
do
you
know
where
it
is
oh
sure
miss
l
the
dressmaker
came
in
just
after
you
left
she
is
a
very
particular
friend
of
mine
and
i
showed
her
your
dress
she
admired
it
above
all
things
and
borrowed
it
to
get
the
pattern
for
miss
r
wedding
dress
she
promised
to
return
it
provoking
i
wanted
it
who
ever
heard
of
borrowing
a
person
dress
without
the
leave
of
the
owner
truly
this
is
a
country
one
very
severe
winter
night
a
neighbour
borrowed
of
me
a
blanket
it
was
one
of
my
best
for
the
use
of
a
stranger
who
was
passing
the
night
at
her
house
i
could
not
well
refuse
but
at
that
time
the
world
pressed
me
sore
and
i
could
ill
spare
it
two
years
elapsed
and
i
saw
no
more
of
my
blanket
at
length
i
sent
a
note
to
the
lady
requesting
it
to
be
returned
i
got
a
very
short
answer
back
and
the
blanket
alas
worn
threadbare
the
borrower
stating
that
she
had
sent
the
article
but
really
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
without
it
as
she
wanted
it
to
cover
the
children
bed
she
certainly
forgot
that
i
too
had
children
who
wanted
covering
as
well
as
her
own
but
i
have
said
so
much
of
the
ill
results
of
others
borrowing
that
i
will
close
this
sketch
by
relating
my
own
experience
in
this
way
after
removing
to
the
bush
many
misfortunes
befel
us
which
deprived
us
of
our
income
and
reduced
us
to
great
poverty
in
fact
we
were
strangers
and
the
knowing
ones
took
us
in
and
for
many
years
we
struggled
with
hardships
which
would
have
broken
stouter
hearts
than
ours
had
not
our
trust
been
placed
in
the
almighty
who
among
all
our
troubles
never
wholly
deserted
us
while
my
husband
was
absent
on
the
frontier
during
the
rebellion
my
youngest
boy
fell
very
sick
and
required
my
utmost
care
both
by
night
and
day
to
attend
to
him
properly
a
candle
burning
during
the
night
was
necessary
the
last
candle
was
burnt
out
i
had
no
money
to
buy
another
and
no
fat
from
which
i
could
make
one
i
hated
borrowing
but
for
the
dear
child
sake
i
overcame
my
scruples
and
succeeded
in
procuring
a
candle
from
a
good
neighbour
but
with
strict
injunctions
for
it
was
that
i
must
return
it
if
i
did
not
require
it
during
the
night
i
went
home
quite
grateful
with
my
prize
it
was
a
clear
moonlight
night
the
dear
boy
was
better
so
i
told
old
jenny
my
irish
servant
to
go
to
bed
as
i
would
lie
down
in
my
clothes
by
the
child
and
if
he
were
worse
i
would
get
up
and
light
the
candle
it
happened
that
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
out
of
the
window
frame
and
i
had
supplied
its
place
by
fitting
in
a
shingle
my
friend
emilia
s
had
a
large
who
when
his
mistress
was
absent
often
paid
me
a
predatory
or
borrowing
visit
and
tom
had
a
practice
of
pushing
in
this
wooden
pane
in
order
to
pursue
his
lawless
depredations
i
had
forgotten
all
this
and
never
dreaming
that
tom
would
appropriate
such
light
food
i
left
the
candle
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
table
just
under
the
window
between
sleeping
and
waking
i
heard
the
pane
gently
pushed
in
the
thought
instantly
struck
me
that
it
was
tom
and
that
for
lack
of
something
better
he
might
steal
my
precious
candle
i
sprang
up
from
the
bed
just
in
time
to
see
him
dart
through
the
broken
window
dragging
the
long
white
candle
after
him
i
flew
to
the
door
and
pursued
him
half
over
the
field
but
all
to
no
purpose
i
can
see
him
now
as
i
saw
him
then
scampering
away
for
dear
life
with
his
prize
trailing
behind
him
gleaming
like
a
silver
tail
in
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
ah
never
did
i
feel
more
acutely
the
truth
of
the
proverb
those
that
go
go
than
i
did
that
night
my
poor
boy
awoke
ill
and
feverish
and
i
had
no
light
to
assist
him
or
even
to
look
into
his
sweet
face
to
see
how
far
i
dared
hope
that
the
light
of
day
would
find
him
better
oh
canada
thy
gloomy
woods
a
song
oh
canada
thy
gloomy
woods
will
never
cheer
the
heart
the
murmur
of
thy
mighty
floods
but
cause
fresh
tears
to
start
from
those
whose
fondest
wishes
rest
beyond
the
distant
main
who
the
forests
of
the
west
sigh
for
their
homes
again
i
too
have
felt
the
chilling
blight
their
shadows
cast
on
me
my
thought
by
day
my
dream
by
night
was
of
my
own
country
but
independent
souls
will
brave
all
hardships
to
be
free
no
more
i
weep
to
cross
the
wave
my
native
land
to
see
but
ever
as
a
thought
most
bless
her
distant
shores
will
rise
in
all
their
beauty
dress
to
cheer
my
mental
eyes
and
treasured
in
my
inmost
heart
the
friends
i
left
behind
but
reason

that
bade
us
part
now
bids
me
be

i
see
my
children
round
me

dash
regretful
tears
away
and
lift
my
thoughts
above
in
humble
gratitude
to
bless
the

spread
our
table
in

apartment
but
through
a
square
hole
cut
in
one
of
the
planks
just
wide
enough
to
admit
a
man
head
through
the
aperture
here
we
made
tom
a
comfortable
bed
on
the
floor
and
did
the
best
we
could
to
nurse
him
through
his
sickness
his
long
thin
face
emaciated
with
disease
and
surrounded
by
huge
black
whiskers
and
a
beard
of
a
week
growth
looked
perfectly
unearthly
he
had
only
to
stare
at
the
baby
to
frighten
her
almost
out
of
her
wits
how
fond
that
young
one
is
of
me
he
would
say
she
cries
for
joy
at
the
sight
of
among
his
curiosities
and
he
had
many
he
held
in
great
esteem
a
huge
nose
made
hollow
to
fit
his
face
which
his
father
a
being
almost
as
eccentric
as
himself
had
carved
out
of
boxwood
when
he
slipped
this
nose
over
his
own
which
was
no
beautiful
classical
specimen
of
a
nasal
organ
it
made
a
most
perfect
and
hideous
disguise
the
mother
who
bore
him
never
would
have
recognised
her
accomplished
son
numberless
were
the
tricks
he
played
off
with
this
nose
once
he
walked
through
the
streets
of
with
this
proboscis
attached
to
his
face
what
a
nose
look
at
the
man
with
the
nose
cried
all
the
boys
in
the
street
a
party
of
irish
emigrants
passed
at
the
moment
the
men
with
the
courtesy
natural
to
their
nation
forbore
to
laugh
in
the
gentleman
face
but
after
they
had
passed
tom
looked
back
and
saw
them
bent
half
double
in
convulsions
of
mirth
tom
made
the
party
a
low
bow
gravely
took
off
his
nose
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
day
after
this
frolic
he
had
a
very
severe
fit
of
the
ague
and
looked
so
ill
that
i
really
entertained
fears
for
his
life
the
hot
fit
had
just
left
him
and
he
lay
upon
his
bed
bedewed
with
a
cold
perspiration
in
a
state
of
complete
exhaustion
poor
tom
said
i
he
has
passed
a
horrible
day
but
the
worst
is
over
and
i
will
make
him
a
cup
of
while
preparing
it
old
satan
came
in
and
began
to
talk
to
my
husband
he
happened
to
sit
directly
opposite
the
aperture
which
gave
light
and
air
to
tom
berth
this
man
was
disgustingly
ugly
he
had
lost
one
eye
in
a
quarrel
it
had
been
gouged
out
in
the
barbarous
conflict
and
the
side
of
his
face
presented
a
succession
of
horrible
scars
inflicted
by
the
teeth
of
his
savage
adversary
the
nickname
he
had
acquired
through
the
country
sufficiently
testified
to
the
respectability
of
his
character
and
dreadful
tales
were
told
of
him
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
was
alike
feared
and
hated
the
rude
fellow
with
his
accustomed
insolence
began
abusing
the
old
country
folks
the
english
were
great
bullies
he
said
they
thought
no
one
could
fight
but
themselves
but
the
yankees
had
whipped
them
and
would
whip
them
again
he
was
not
afear
of
them
he
never
was
in
his
life
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
horrible
apparition
presented
itself
to
his
view
slowly
rising
from
his
bed
and
putting
on
the
fictitious
nose
while
he
drew
his
white
nightcap
over
his
ghastly
and
livid
brow
tom
thrust
his
face
through
the
aperture
and
uttered
a
diabolical
cry
then
sank
down
upon
his
unseen
couch
as
noiselessly
as
he
had
arisen
the
cry
was
like
nothing
human
and
it
was
echoed
by
an
involuntary
scream
from
the
lips
of
our
and
myself
good
god
what
that
cried
satan
falling
back
in
his
chair
and
pointing
to
the
vacant
aperture
did
you
hear
it
did
you
see
it
it
beats
the
universe
i
never
saw
a
ghost
or
the
devil
before
moodie
who
had
recognised
the
ghost
and
greatly
enjoyed
the
fun
pretended
profound
ignorance
and
coolly
insinuated
that
old
satan
had
lost
his
senses
the
man
was
bewildered
he
stared
at
the
vacant
aperture
then
at
us
in
turn
as
if
he
doubted
the
accuracy
of
his
own
vision
is
tarnation
odd
he
said
but
the
women
heard
it
i
heard
a
sound
i
said
a
dreadful
sound
but
i
saw
no
sure
an
was
himsel
said
my
lowland
scotch
girl
who
now
perceived
the
joke
he
was
to
gie
us
puir
bodies
a
wee
how
long
have
you
been
subject
to
these
sort
of
fits
said
i
you
had
better
speak
to
the
doctor
about
them
such
fancies
if
they
are
not
attended
to
often
end
in
mad
very
indignantly
i
guess
i
not
mad
but
as
wide
awake
as
you
are
did
i
not
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
then
the
noise
i
could
not
make
such
a
tarnation
outcry
to
save
my
life
but
be
it
man
or
devil
i
do
care
i
not
afear
doubling
his
fist
very
undecidedly
at
the
hole
again
the
ghastly
head
was
protruded
the
dreadful
eyes
rolled
wildly
in
their
hollow
sockets
and
a
yell
more
appalling
than
the
former
rang
through
the
room
the
man
sprang
from
his
chair
which
he
overturned
in
his
fright
and
stood
for
an
instant
with
his
starting
from
his
head
and
glaring
upon
the
spectre
his
cheeks
deadly
pale
the
cold
perspiration
streaming
from
his
face
his
lips
dissevered
and
his
teeth
chattering
in
his
head
there
there
there
look
look
it
comes
again
the
devil
the
devil
here
tom
who
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
victim
gave
a
knowing
wink
and
thrust
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
he
is
coming
he
is
coming
cried
the
affrighted
wretch
and
clearing
the
open
doorway
with
one
leap
he
fled
across
the
field
at
full
speed
the
stream
intercepted
his
path
he
passed
it
at
a
bound
plunged
into
the
forest
and
was
out
of
sight
ha
ha
ha
chuckled
poor
tom
sinking
down
exhausted
on
his
bed
oh
that
i
had
strength
to
follow
up
my
advantage
i
would
lead
old
satan
such
a
chase
that
he
should
think
his
namesake
was
in
truth
behind
during
the
six
weeks
that
we
inhabited
that
wretched
cabin
we
never
were
troubled
by
old
satan
again
as
tom
slowly
recovered
and
began
to
regain
his
appetite
his
soul
sickened
over
the
salt
beef
and
pork
which
owing
to
our
distance
from
formed
our
principal
fare
he
positively
refused
to
touch
the
sad
bread
as
my
yankee
neighbours
very
appropriately
termed
the
unleavened
cakes
in
the
pan
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
send
a
man
on
horseback
eight
miles
to
fetch
a
loaf
of
bread
do
my
dear
moodie
like
a
good
christian
as
you
are
give
me
a
morsel
of
the
baby
biscuit
and
try
and
make
us
some
decent
bread
the
stuff
your
servant
gives
us
is
uneatable
said
wilson
to
me
in
most
imploring
accents
most
willingly
but
i
have
no
yeast
and
i
never
baked
in
one
of
those
strange
kettles
in
my
i
go
to
old
joe
wife
and
borrow
some
said
he
they
are
always
borrowing
of
away
he
went
across
the
field
but
soon
returned
i
looked
into
his
jug
it
was
empty
no
luck
said
he
those
stingy
wretches
had
just
baked
a
fine
batch
of
bread
and
they
would
neither
lend
nor
sell
a
loaf
but
they
told
me
how
to
make
their
well
discuss
the
same
but
i
much
doubted
if
he
could
remember
the
recipe
you
are
to
take
an
old
tin
pan
said
he
sitting
down
on
the
stool
and
poking
the
fire
with
a
stick
must
it
be
an
old
one
said
i
laughing
of
course
they
said
and
what
am
i
to
put
into
it
patience
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
some
flour
and
some
milk
but
by
george
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
was
wondering
as
i
came
across
the
field
why
they
called
the
yeast
and
that
put
the
way
to
make
it
quite
out
of
my
head
but
never
mind
it
is
only
ten
by
my
watch
i
having
nothing
to
do
i
will
go
he
went
would
i
had
been
there
to
hear
the
colloquy
between
him
and
joe
he
described
it
something
to
this
effect
joe
well
stranger
what
do
you
want
now
tom
i
have
forgotten
the
way
you
told
me
how
to
make
the
joe
i
never
told
you
how
to
make
bread
i
guess
you
are
a
fool
people
have
to
raise
bread
before
they
can
bake
it
pray
who
sent
you
to
make
game
of
me
i
guess
somebody
as
wise
as
tom
the
lady
at
whose
house
i
am
joe
lady
i
can
tell
you
that
we
have
no
ladies
here
so
the
old
woman
who
lives
in
the
old
log
shanty
in
the
hollow
do
know
how
to
make
bread
a
clever
wife
that
are
you
her
husband
tom
shakes
his
head
her
brother
another
shake
her
son
do
you
hear
or
are
you
deaf
going
quite
close
up
to
him
tom
moving
back
mistress
i
not
deaf
and
who
or
what
i
am
is
nothing
to
you
will
you
oblige
me
by
telling
me
how
to
make
the
and
this
time
i
put
it
down
in
my
joe
with
a
strong
sneer
milk
i
told
you
so
you
expect
me
to
answer
your
questions
and
give
back
nothing
in
return
get
you
gone
i
tell
you
no
more
about
tom
bowing
very
low
thank
you
for
your
civility
is
the
old
woman
who
lives
in
the
little
shanty
near
the
more
obliging
joe
that
my
husband
mother
you
may
try
i
guess
give
you
an
exit
slamming
the
door
in
his
face
and
what
did
you
do
then
said
i
oh
went
of
course
the
door
was
open
and
i
reconnoitred
the
premises
before
i
ventured
in
i
liked
the
phiz
of
the
old
woman
a
deal
better
than
that
of
her
although
it
was
cunning
and
inquisitive
and
as
sharp
as
a
needle
she
was
busy
shelling
cobs
of
indian
corn
into
a
barrel
i
rapped
at
the
door
she
told
me
to
come
in
and
in
i
stepped
she
asked
me
if
i
wanted
her
i
told
her
my
errand
at
which
she
laughed
old
woman
you
are
from
the
old
country
i
guess
or
you
would
know
how
to
make
now
i
always
prefer
they
make
the
best
bread
the
milk
i
opine
gives
it
a
sourish
taste
and
the
bran
is
the
least
tom
then
let
us
have
the
bran
by
all
means
how
do
you
make
it
old
woman
i
put
a
double
handful
of
bran
into
a
small
pot
or
kettle
but
a
jug
will
do
and
a
teaspoonful
of
salt
but
mind
you
do
kill
it
with
salt
for
if
you
do
it
wo
rise
i
then
add
as
much
warm
water
at
as
will
mix
it
into
a
stiff
batter
i
then
put
the
jug
into
a
pan
of
warm
water
and
set
it
on
the
hearth
near
the
fire
and
keep
it
at
the
same
heat
until
it
rises
which
it
generally
will
do
if
you
attend
to
it
in
two
or
three
hours
time
when
the
bran
cracks
at
the
top
and
you
see
white
bubbles
rising
through
it
you
may
strain
it
into
your
flour
and
lay
your
bread
it
makes
good
tom
my
good
woman
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
we
have
no
bran
can
you
give
me
a
small
quantity
old
woman
i
never
give
anything
you
englishers
who
come
out
with
stacks
of
money
can
afford
to
tom
sell
me
a
small
old
woman
i
guess
i
edging
quite
close
and
fixing
her
sharp
eyes
on
him
you
must
be
very
rich
to
buy
tom
quizzically
oh
very
old
woman
how
do
you
get
your
money
tom
sarcastically
i
do
steal
old
woman
not
i
guess
you
soon
let
others
do
that
for
you
if
you
do
take
care
are
the
people
you
live
with
related
to
you
tom
hardly
able
to
keep
his
gravity
on
eve
side
they
are
my
old
woman
in
surprise
and
do
they
keep
you
for
nothing
or
do
you
work
for
your
meat
tom
impatiently
is
that
bran
ready
the
old
woman
goes
to
the
binn
and
measures
out
a
quart
of
bran
what
am
i
to
pay
you
old
woman
a
york
tom
wishing
to
test
her
honesty
is
there
any
difference
between
a
york
shilling
and
a
shilling
of
british
currency
old
woman
evasively
i
guess
not
is
there
not
a
place
in
england
called
york
looking
up
and
leering
knowingly
in
his
face
tom
laughing
you
are
not
going
to
come
york
over
me
in
that
way
or
yankee
either
there
is
threepence
for
your
pound
of
bran
you
are
enormously
old
woman
calling
after
him
but
the
recipe
do
you
allow
nothing
for
the
recipe
tom
it
is
included
in
the
price
of
the
and
so
said
he
i
came
laughing
away
rejoicing
in
my
sleeve
that
i
had
disappointed
the
avaricious
old
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
set
the
bran
rising
by
the
help
of
tom
recipe
it
was
duly
mixed
in
the
and
placed
within
a
tin
pan
full
of
hot
water
by
the
side
of
the
fire
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
a
watched
pot
never
boils
and
there
certainly
was
no
lack
of
watchers
in
this
case
tom
sat
for
hours
regarding
it
with
his
large
heavy
eyes
the
maid
inspected
it
from
time
to
time
and
scarce
ten
minutes
were
suffered
to
elapse
without
my
testing
the
heat
of
the
water
and
the
state
of
the
emptyings
but
the
day
slipped
slowly
away
and
night
drew
on
and
yet
the
watched
pot
gave
no
signs
of
vitality
tom
sighed
deeply
when
we
sat
down
to
tea
with
the
old
fare
never
mind
said
he
we
shall
get
some
good
bread
in
the
morning
it
must
get
up
by
that
time
i
will
wait
till
then
i
could
almost
starve
before
i
could
touch
these
leaden
the
were
removed
tom
took
up
his
flute
and
commenced
a
series
of
the
wildest
voluntary
airs
that
ever
were
breathed
forth
by
human
lungs
mad
jigs
to
which
the
gravest
of
mankind
might
have
cut
eccentric
capers
we
were
all
convulsed
with
laughter
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
droll
movements
tom
suddenly
hopped
like
a
kangaroo
which
feat
he
performed
by
raising
himself
upon
then
flinging
himself
forward
with
a
stooping
jerk
towards
the
hearth
and
squinting
down
into
the
in
the
most
quizzical
manner
exclaimed
miserable
chaff
if
that
does
not
make
you
rise
nothing
i
left
the
bran
all
night
by
the
fire
early
in
the
morning
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
it
had
risen
high
above
the
rim
of
the
pot
and
was
surrounded
by
a
fine
crown
of
bubbles
better
late
than
never
thought
i
as
i
emptied
the
emptyings
into
my
flour
tom
is
not
up
yet
i
will
make
him
so
happy
with
a
loaf
of
new
bread
nice
bread
for
his
it
was
my
first
canadian
loaf
i
felt
quite
proud
of
it
as
i
placed
it
in
the
odd
machine
in
which
it
was
to
be
baked
i
did
not
understand
the
method
of
baking
in
these
ovens
or
that
my
bread
should
have
remained
in
the
kettle
for
half
an
hour
until
it
had
risen
the
second
time
before
i
applied
the
fire
to
it
in
order
that
the
bread
should
be
light
it
not
only
required
experience
to
know
when
it
was
in
a
fit
state
for
baking
but
the
oven
should
have
been
brought
to
a
proper
temperature
to
receive
the
bread
ignorant
of
all
this
i
put
my
unrisen
bread
into
a
cold
kettle
and
heaped
a
large
quantity
of
hot
ashes
above
and
below
it
the
first
intimation
i
had
of
the
result
of
my
experiment
was
the
disagreeable
odour
of
burning
bread
filling
the
house
what
is
this
horrid
smell
cried
tom
issuing
from
his
domicile
in
his
shirt
sleeves
do
open
the
door
bell
to
the
maid
i
feel
quite
it
is
the
bread
said
i
taking
the
lid
of
the
oven
with
the
tongs
dear
me
it
is
all
burnt
and
smells
as
sour
as
vinegar
says
he
the
black
bread
of
sparta
alas
for
my
maiden
loaf
with
a
rueful
face
i
placed
it
on
the
breakfast
table
i
hoped
to
have
given
you
a
treat
but
i
fear
you
will
find
it
worse
than
the
cakes
in
the
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
tom
as
he
stuck
his
knife
into
the
loaf
and
drew
it
forth
covered
with
raw
dough
oh
moodie
i
hope
you
make
better
books
than
we
were
all
sadly
disappointed
the
others
submitted
to
my
failure
and
made
it
the
subject
of
many
droll
but
not
unkindly
witicisms
for
myself
i
could
have
borne
the
severest
infliction
from
the
pen
of
the
most
formidable
critic
with
more
fortitude
than
i
bore
the
cutting
up
of
my
first
loaf
of
bread
after
breakfast
moodie
and
wilson
rode
into
the
town
and
when
they
returned
at
night
brought
several
long
letters
for
me
ah
those
first
kind
letters
from
home
never
shall
i
forget
the
rapture
with
which
i
grasped
them
the
eager
trembling
haste
with
which
i
tore
them
open
while
the
blinding
tears
which
filled
my
eyes
hindered
me
for
some
minutes
from
reading
a
word
which
they
contained
sixteen
years
have
slowly
passed
away
it
appears
half
a
century
but
never
never
can
home
letters
give
me
the
intense
joy
those
letters
did
after
seven
years
exile
the
hope
of
return
grows
feeble
the
means
are
still
less
in
our
power
and
our
friends
give
up
all
hope
of
our
return
their
letters
grow
fewer
and
colder
their
expressions
of
attachment
are
less
vivid
the
heart
has
formed
new
ties
and
the
poor
emigrant
is
nearly
forgotten
double
those
years
and
it
is
as
if
the
grave
had
closed
over
you
and
the
hearts
that
once
knew
and
loved
you
know
you
no
more
tom
too
had
a
large
packet
of
letters
which
he
read
with
great
glee
after
them
he
declared
his
intention
of
setting
off
on
his
return
home
the
next
day
we
tried
to
persuade
him
to
stay
until
the
following
spring
and
make
a
fair
trial
of
the
country
arguments
were
thrown
away
upon
him
the
next
morning
our
eccentric
friend
was
ready
to
start
quoth
he
shaking
me
by
the
hand
as
if
he
meant
to
sever
it
from
the
wrist
when
next
we
meet
it
will
be
in
new
south
wales
and
i
hope
by
that
time
you
will
know
how
to
make
better
and
thus
ended

brought

chapter
vii
uncle
joe
and
his
family
ay
your
rogue
is
a
laughing
rogue
and
not
a
whit
the
less
dangerous
for
the
smile
on
his
lip
which
comes
not
from
an
honest
heart
which
reflects
the
light
of
the
soul
through
the
eye
all
is
hollow
and
dark
within
and
the
contortion
of
the
lip
like
the
phosophoric
glow
upon
decayed
timber
only
serves
to
point
out
the
rotteness
uncle
joe
i
see
him
now
before
me
with
his
jolly
red
face
twinkling
black
eyes
and
rubicund
nose
no
thin
yankee
was
he
looking
as
if
he
had
lived
upon
ideas
and
speculations
all
his
life
yet
yankee
he
was
by
birth
ay
and
in
mind
too
for
a
more
knowing
fellow
at
a
bargain
never
crossed
the
lakes
to
abuse
british
institutions
and
locate
himself
comfortably
among
despised
britishers
but
then
he
had
such
a
fat
face
such
a
mischievous
smile
and
such
a
merry
roguish
expression
in
those
small
glittering
eyes
that
you
suffered
yourself
to
be
taken
in
by
him
without
offering
the
least
resistance
to
his
impositions
uncle
joe
father
had
been
a
new
england
loyalist
and
his
doubtful
attachment
to
the
british
government
had
been
repaid
by
a
grant
of
land
in
the
township
of
h
he
was
the
first
settler
in
that
township
and
chose
his
location
in
a
remote
spot
for
the
sake
of
a
beautiful
natural
spring
which
bubbled
up
in
a
small
stone
basin
in
the
green
bank
at
the
back
of
the
house
father
might
have
had
the
pick
of
the
township
quoth
uncle
joe
but
the
old
coon
preferred
that
sup
of
good
water
to
the
site
of
a
town
well
i
guess
it
seldom
i
trouble
the
spring
and
whenever
i
step
that
way
to
water
the
horses
i
think
what
a
tarnation
fool
the
old
one
was
to
throw
away
such
a
chance
of
making
his
fortune
for
such
cold
your
father
was
a
temperance
man
temperance
he
had
been
fond
enough
of
the
whiskey
bottle
in
his
day
he
drank
up
a
good
farm
in
the
united
states
and
then
he
thought
he
could
not
do
better
than
turn
loyal
and
get
one
here
for
nothing
he
did
not
care
a
cent
not
he
for
the
king
of
england
he
thought
himself
as
good
any
how
but
he
found
that
he
would
have
to
work
hard
here
to
scratch
along
and
he
was
mightily
plagued
with
the
rheumatics
and
some
old
woman
told
him
that
good
spring
water
was
the
best
cure
for
that
so
he
chose
this
poor
light
stony
land
on
account
of
the
spring
and
took
to
hard
work
and
drinking
cold
water
in
his
old
how
did
the
change
agree
with
him
i
guess
better
than
could
have
been
expected
he
planted
that
fine
orchard
and
cleared
his
hundred
acres
and
we
got
along
slick
enough
as
long
as
the
old
fellow
and
what
happened
after
his
death
that
obliged
you
to
part
with
your
land
bad
times
bad
crops
said
uncle
joe
lifting
his
shoulders
i
had
not
my
father
way
of
scraping
money
together
i
made
some
deuced
clever
speculations
but
they
all
failed
i
married
young
and
got
a
large
family
and
the
women
critters
ran
up
heavy
bills
at
the
stores
and
the
crops
did
not
yield
enough
to
pay
them
and
from
bad
we
got
to
worse
and
c
put
in
an
execution
and
seized
upon
the
whole
concern
he
sold
it
to
your
man
for
double
what
it
cost
him
and
you
got
all
that
my
father
toiled
for
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
for
less
than
half
the
cash
he
laid
out
upon
clearing
and
had
the
whiskey
nothing
to
do
with
this
change
said
i
looking
him
in
the
face
suspiciously
not
a
bit
when
a
man
gets
into
difficulties
it
is
the
only
thing
to
keep
him
from
sinking
outright
when
your
husband
has
had
as
many
troubles
as
i
have
had
he
will
know
how
to
value
the
whiskey
this
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
urchin
of
five
years
old
dressed
in
a
coat
and
trousers
popping
his
black
shock
head
in
at
the
door
and
calling
out
uncle
joe
you
wanted
to
is
that
your
nephew
no
i
guess
is
my
woman
eldest
son
said
uncle
joe
rising
but
they
call
me
uncle
joe
is
a
spry
chap
that
as
cunning
as
a
fox
i
tell
you
what
it
is
he
will
make
a
smart
man
go
home
ammon
and
tell
your
ma
that
i
am
i
wo
said
the
boy
you
may
go
hum
and
tell
her
yourself
she
has
wanted
wood
cut
this
hour
and
you
catch
it
away
ran
the
dutiful
son
but
not
before
he
had
applied
his
forefinger
significantly
to
the
side
of
his
nose
and
with
a
knowing
wink
pointed
in
the
direction
of
home
uncle
joe
obeyed
the
signal
drily
remarking
that
he
could
not
leave
the
barn
door
without
the
old
hen
clucking
him
back
at
this
period
we
were
still
living
in
old
satan
log
house
and
anxiously
looking
out
for
the
first
snow
to
put
us
in
possession
of
the
good
substantial
log
dwelling
occupied
by
uncle
joe
and
his
family
which
consisted
of
a
brown
brood
of
seven
girls
and
the
boy
who
rejoiced
in
the
extraordinary
name
of
ammon
strange
names
are
to
be
found
in
this
free
country
what
think
you
gentle
reader
of
solomon
sly
reynard
fox
and
hiram
dolittle
and
prudence
fidget
all
veritable
names
and
belonging
to
substantial
yeomen
after
ammon
and
ichabod
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
meet
with
judas
iscariot
pilate
and
herod
and
then
the
female
appellations
but
the
subject
is
a
delicate
one
and
i
will
forbear
to
touch
upon
it
i
have
enjoyed
many
a
hearty
laugh
over
the
strange
affectations
which
people
designate
here
very
handsome
names
i
prefer
the
old
homely
jewish
names
such
as
that
which
it
pleased
my
godfather
and
godmothers
to
bestow
upon
me
to
one
of
those
christianities
the
minervas
cinderellas
and
almerias
of
canada
the
love
of
singular
names
is
here
carried
to
a
marvellous
extent
it
is
only
yesterday
that
in
passing
through
one
busy
village
i
stopped
in
astonishment
before
a
tombstone
headed
thus
sacred
to
the
memory
of
silence
sharman
the
beloved
wife
of
asa
was
the
woman
deaf
and
dumb
or
did
her
friends
hope
by
bestowing
upon
her
such
an
impossible
name
to
still
the
voice
of
nature
and
check
by
an
admonitory
appellative
the
active
spirit
that
lives
in
the
tongue
of
woman
truly
asa
sharman
if
thy
wife
was
silent
by
name
as
well
as
by
nature
thou
wert
a
fortunate
man
but
to
return
to
uncle
joe
he
made
many
fair
promises
of
leaving
the
residence
we
had
bought
the
moment
he
had
sold
his
crops
and
could
remove
his
family
we
could
see
no
interest
which
could
be
served
by
his
deceiving
us
and
therefore
we
believed
him
striving
to
make
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
could
in
the
meantime
in
our
present
wretched
abode
but
matters
are
never
so
bad
but
that
they
may
be
worse
one
day
when
we
were
at
dinner
a
waggon
drove
up
to
the
door
and
alighted
accompanied
by
a
man
who
proved
to
be
captain
s
who
had
just
arrived
from
demarara
with
his
wife
and
family
who
had
purchased
the
farm
of
old
satan
had
brought
captain
s
over
to
inspect
the
land
as
he
wished
to
buy
a
farm
and
settle
in
that
neighbourhood
with
some
difficulty
i
contrived
to
accommodate
the
visitors
with
seats
and
provide
them
with
a
tolerable
dinner
fortunately
moodie
had
brought
in
a
brace
of
fine
fat
partridges
that
morning
these
the
servant
transferred
to
a
pot
of
boiling
water
in
which
she
immersed
them
for
the
space
of
a
minute
a
novel
but
very
expeditious
way
of
removing
the
feathers
which
then
come
off
at
the
least
touch
in
less
than
ten
minutes
they
were
stuffed
trussed
and
in
the
and
before
the
gentlemen
returned
from
walking
over
the
farm
the
dinner
was
on
the
table
to
our
utter
consternation
captain
s
agreed
to
purchase
and
asked
if
we
could
give
him
possession
in
a
week
good
heavens
cried
i
glancing
reproachfully
at
who
was
discussing
his
partridge
with
stoical
indifference
what
will
become
of
us
where
are
we
to
go
oh
make
yourself
easy
i
will
force
that
old
witch
joe
mother
to
clear
but
is
impossible
to
stow
ourselves
into
that
it
will
only
be
for
a
week
or
two
at
farthest
this
is
october
joe
will
be
sure
to
be
off
by
the
first
of
but
if
she
refuses
to
give
up
the
place
oh
leave
her
to
me
i
talk
her
over
said
the
knowing
land
speculator
let
it
come
to
the
worst
he
said
turning
to
my
husband
she
will
go
out
for
the
sake
of
a
few
dollars
she
refused
to
bar
the
dower
when
i
bought
the
place
we
must
cajole
her
out
of
that
it
is
a
fine
afternoon
suppose
we
walk
over
the
hill
and
try
our
luck
with
the
old
nigger
i
felt
so
anxious
about
the
result
of
the
negotiation
that
throwing
my
cloak
over
my
shoulders
and
tying
on
my
bonnet
without
the
assistance
of
a
glass
i
took
my
husband
arm
and
we
walked
forth
it
was
a
bright
clear
afternoon
the
first
week
in
october
and
the
fading
woods
not
yet
denuded
of
their
gorgeous
foliage
glowed
in
a
mellow
golden
light
a
soft
purple
haze
rested
on
the
bold
outline
of
the
haldimand
hills
and
in
the
rugged
beauty
of
the
wild
landscape
i
soon
forgot
the
purport
of
our
visit
to
the
old
log
hut
on
reaching
the
ridge
of
the
hill
the
lovely
valley
in
which
our
future
home
lay
smiled
peacefully
upoon
us
from
amidst
its
fruitful
orchards
still
loaded
with
their
rich
ripe
fruit
what
a
pretty
place
it
is
thought
i
for
the
first
time
feeling
something
like
a
local
interest
in
the
spot
springing
up
in
my
heart
how
i
wish
those
odious
people
would
give
us
possession
of
the
home
which
for
some
time
has
been
our
the
log
hut
that
we
were
approaching
and
in
which
the
old
woman
r
resided
by
herself
having
quarrelled
years
ago
with
her
wife
was
of
the
smallest
dimensions
only
containing
one
room
which
served
the
old
dame
for
kitchen
and
and
all
the
open
door
and
a
few
glazed
panes
supplied
it
with
light
and
air
while
a
huge
hearth
on
which
crackled
two
enormous
logs
which
are
technically
termed
a
front
and
a
back
stick
took
up
nearly
half
the
domicile
and
the
old
woman
bed
which
was
covered
with
an
unexceptionally
clean
patched
quilt
nearly
the
other
half
leaving
just
room
for
a
small
deal
table
of
the
rudest
workmanship
two
chairs
stained
red
one
of
which
was
a
appropiated
solely
to
the
old
woman
use
and
a
spinning
wheel
amidst
this
muddle
of
things
for
small
as
was
the
quantum
of
furniture
it
was
all
crowded
into
such
a
tiny
space
that
you
had
to
squeeze
your
way
through
it
in
the
best
manner
you
could
we
found
the
old
woman
with
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
tied
over
her
grey
locks
shelling
white
into
a
wooden
bowl
without
rising
from
her
seat
she
pointed
to
the
only
remaining
chair
i
guess
miss
you
can
sit
there
and
if
the
others
ca
stand
they
can
make
a
seat
of
my
the
gentlemen
assured
her
that
they
were
not
tired
and
could
dispense
with
seats
then
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
proffering
his
hand
asked
after
her
health
in
his
blandest
manner
i
none
the
better
for
seeing
you
or
the
like
of
you
was
the
ungracious
reply
you
have
cheated
my
poor
boy
out
of
his
good
farm
and
i
hope
it
may
prove
a
bad
bargain
to
you
and
mrs
r
returned
the
land
speculator
nothing
ruffled
by
her
unceremonious
greeting
i
could
not
help
your
son
giving
way
to
drink
and
getting
into
my
debt
if
people
will
be
so
imprudent
they
can
not
be
so
stupid
as
to
imagine
that
others
can
suffer
for
their
suffer
repeated
the
old
woman
flashing
her
small
keen
black
eyes
upon
him
with
a
glance
of
withering
scorn
you
suffer
i
wonder
what
the
widows
and
orphans
you
have
cheated
would
say
to
that
my
son
was
a
poor
weak
silly
fool
to
be
sucked
in
by
the
like
of
you
for
a
debt
of
eight
hundred
dollars
the
goods
never
cost
you
four
hundred
you
take
from
us
our
good
farm
and
these
i
pointing
to
my
husband
and
me
are
the
folk
you
sold
it
to
pray
miss
turning
quickly
to
me
what
might
your
man
give
for
the
place
three
hundred
pounds
in
poor
sufferer
again
sneered
the
hag
four
hundred
dollars
is
a
very
profit
in
as
many
weeks
well
i
guess
you
beat
the
yankees
hollow
and
pray
what
brought
you
here
scenting
about
you
like
a
we
have
no
more
land
for
you
to
seize
from
moodie
now
stepped
forward
and
briefly
explained
our
situation
offering
the
old
woman
anything
in
reason
to
give
up
the
cottage
and
reside
with
her
son
until
he
removed
from
the
premises
which
he
added
must
be
in
a
very
short
time
the
old
dame
regarded
him
with
a
sarcastic
smile
i
guess
joe
will
take
his
own
time
the
house
is
not
built
which
is
to
receive
him
and
he
is
not
a
man
to
turn
his
back
upon
a
warm
hearth
to
camp
in
the
wilderness
you
were
when
you
bought
a
farm
of
that
man
without
getting
along
with
it
the
right
of
but
r
your
son
promised
to
go
out
the
first
of
wheugh
said
the
old
woman
would
you
have
a
man
give
away
his
hat
and
leave
his
own
head
bare
it
neither
the
first
snow
nor
the
last
frost
that
will
turn
joe
out
of
his
comfortable
home
i
tell
you
all
that
he
will
stay
here
if
it
is
only
to
plague
threats
and
remonstrances
were
alike
useless
the
old
woman
remained
inexorable
and
we
were
just
turning
to
leave
the
house
when
the
cunning
old
fox
exclaimed
and
now
what
will
you
give
me
to
leave
my
place
twelve
dollars
if
you
give
us
possession
next
monday
said
my
husband
twelve
dollars
i
guess
you
wo
get
me
out
for
the
rent
would
not
be
worth
more
than
a
dollar
a
month
said
pointing
with
his
cane
to
the
dilapidated
walls
mr
moodie
has
offered
you
a
year
rent
for
the
it
may
not
be
worth
a
cent
returned
the
woman
for
it
will
give
everybody
the
rheumatism
that
stays
a
week
in
it
but
it
is
worth
that
to
me
and
more
nor
double
that
just
now
to
him
but
i
will
not
be
hard
with
him
continued
she
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
say
twenty
dollars
and
i
will
turn
out
on
i
dare
say
you
will
said
and
who
do
you
think
would
be
fool
enough
to
give
you
such
an
exorbitant
sum
for
a
ruined
old
shed
like
this
mind
your
own
business
and
make
your
own
bargains
returned
the
old
woman
tartly
the
devil
himself
could
not
deal
with
you
for
i
guess
he
would
have
the
worst
of
it
what
do
you
say
sir
and
she
fixed
her
keen
eyes
upon
my
husband
as
if
she
would
read
his
thoughts
will
you
agree
to
my
price
it
is
a
very
high
one
r
but
as
i
can
not
help
myself
and
you
take
advantage
of
that
i
suppose
i
must
give
is
a
bargain
cried
the
old
crone
holding
out
her
hard
bony
hand
come
cash
down
not
until
you
give
me
possession
on
monday
next
or
you
might
serve
me
as
your
son
has
ha
said
the
old
woman
laughing
and
rubbing
her
hands
together
you
begin
to
see
daylight
do
you
in
a
few
months
with
the
help
of
him
pointing
to
you
will
be
able
to
go
alone
but
have
a
care
of
your
teacher
for
it
no
good
that
you
will
learn
from
him
but
will
you
really
stand
to
your
word
mister
she
added
in
a
coaxing
tone
if
i
go
out
on
monday
to
be
sure
i
will
i
never
break
my
well
i
guess
you
are
not
so
clever
as
our
people
for
they
only
keep
it
as
long
as
it
suits
them
you
have
an
honest
look
i
will
trust
you
but
i
will
not
trust
him
nodding
to
he
can
buy
and
sell
his
word
as
fast
as
a
horse
can
trot
so
on
monday
i
will
turn
out
my
traps
i
have
lived
here
years
is
a
pretty
place
and
it
vexes
me
to
leave
it
continued
the
poor
creature
as
a
touch
of
natural
feeling
softened
and
agitated
her
heart
there
is
not
an
acre
in
cultivation
but
i
helped
to
clear
it
nor
a
tree
in
yonder
orchard
but
i
held
it
while
my
poor
man
who
is
dead
and
gone
planted
it
and
i
have
watched
the
trees
bud
from
year
to
year
until
their
boughs
overshadowed
the
hut
where
all
my
children
but
joe
were
born
yes
i
came
here
young
and
in
my
prime
and
i
must
leave
it
in
age
and
poverty
my
children
and
husband
are
dead
and
their
bones
rest
beneath
the
turf
in
the
on
the
side
of
the
hill
of
all
that
once
gathered
about
my
knees
joe
and
his
young
ones
alone
remain
and
it
is
hard
very
hard
that
i
must
leave
their
graves
to
be
turned
by
the
plough
of
a
i
felt
for
the
desolate
old
creature
the
tears
rushed
to
my
eyes
but
there
was
no
moisture
in
hers
no
rain
from
the
heart
could
filter
through
that
iron
soil
be
assured
r
said
moodie
that
the
dead
will
be
held
sacred
the
place
will
never
be
disturbed
by
perhaps
not
but
it
is
not
long
that
you
will
remain
here
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
in
my
time
but
i
never
saw
a
gentleman
from
the
old
country
make
a
good
canadian
farmer
the
work
is
rough
and
hard
and
they
get
out
of
humour
with
it
and
leave
it
to
their
hired
helps
and
then
all
goes
wrong
they
are
cheated
on
all
sides
and
in
despair
take
to
the
whiskey
bottle
and
that
fixes
them
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mister
i
give
you
just
three
years
to
spend
your
money
and
ruin
yourself
and
then
you
will
become
a
confirmed
drunkard
like
the
the
first
part
of
her
prophecy
was
only
too
true
thank
god
the
last
has
never
been
fulfilled
and
never
can
be
perceiving
that
the
old
woman
was
not
a
little
elated
with
her
bargain
urged
upon
her
the
propriety
of
barring
the
dower
at
first
she
was
outrageous
and
very
abusive
and
rejected
all
his
proposals
with
contempt
vowing
that
she
would
meet
him
in
a
certain
place
below
before
she
would
sign
away
her
right
to
the
property
listen
to
reason
r
said
the
land
speculator
if
you
will
sign
the
papers
before
the
proper
authorities
the
next
time
your
son
drives
you
to
c
i
will
give
you
a
silk
pshaw
buy
a
shroud
for
yourself
you
will
need
it
before
i
want
a
silk
gown
was
the
ungracious
reply
consider
woman
a
black
silk
of
the
best
to
mourn
in
for
my
sins
or
for
the
loss
of
the
farm
twelve
yards
continued
without
noticing
her
rejoinder
at
a
dollar
a
yard
think
what
a
nice
gown
it
will
to
the
devil
with
you
i
never
go
to
i
thought
as
much
said
winking
to
us
well
my
dear
madam
what
will
satisfy
you
i
do
it
for
twenty
dollars
returned
the
old
woman
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
in
her
chair
her
eyes
twinkling
and
her
hands
moving
convulsively
as
if
she
already
grasped
the
money
so
dear
to
her
soul
agreed
said
the
land
speculator
when
will
you
be
in
town
on
tuesday
if
i
be
alive
but
remember
i
not
sign
till
i
have
my
hand
on
the
never
fear
said
as
we
quitted
the
house
then
turning
to
me
he
added
with
a
peculiar
smile
that
a
devilish
smart
woman
she
would
have
made
a
clever
monday
came
and
with
it
all
the
bustle
of
moving
and
as
is
generally
the
case
on
such
occasions
it
turned
out
a
very
wet
day
i
left
old
satan
hut
without
regret
glad
at
any
rate
to
be
in
a
place
of
my
own
however
humble
our
new
habitation
though
small
had
a
decided
advantage
over
the
one
we
were
leaving
it
stood
on
a
gentle
slope
and
a
narrow
but
lovely
stream
full
of
pretty
speckled
trout
ran
murmuring
under
the
little
window
the
house
also
was
surrounded
by
fine
fruit
trees
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
the
sound
of
that
tinkling
brook
for
ever
rolling
by
filled
my
heart
with
a
strange
melancholy
which
for
many
nights
deprived
me
of
rest
i
loved
it
too
the
voice
of
waters
in
the
stillness
of
night
always
had
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
my
mind
their
ceaseless
motion
and
perpetual
sound
convey
to
me
the
idea
of
life
eternal
life
and
looking
upon
them
glancing
and
flashing
on
now
in
sunshine
now
in
shade
now
hoarsely
chiding
with
the
opposing
rock
now
leaping
triumphantly
over
it
creates
within
me
a
feeling
of
mysterious
awe
of
which
i
never
could
wholly
divest
myself
a
portion
of
my
own
spirit
seemed
to
pass
into
that
little
stream
in
its
deep
wailings
and
fretful
sighs
i
fancied
myself
lamenting
for
the
land
i
had
left
for
ever
and
its
restless
and
impetuous
rushings
against
the
stones
which
choked
its
passage
were
mournful
types
of
my
own
mental
struggles
against
the
destiny
which
hemmed
me
in
through
the
day
the
stream
still
moaned
and
travelled
on
but
engaged
in
my
novel
and
distasteful
occupations
i
heard
it
not
but
whenever
my
winged
thoughts
flew
homeward
then
the
voice
of
the
brook
spoke
deeply
and
sadly
to
my
heart
and
my
tears
flowed
unchecked
to
its
plaintive
and
harmonious
music
in
a
few
hours
i
had
my
new
abode
more
comfortably
arranged
than
the
old
although
its
dimensions
were
much
smaller
the
location
was
beautiful
and
i
was
greatly
consoled
by
this
circumstance
the
aspect
of
nature
ever
did
and
i
hope
ever
will
continue
to
shoot
marvellous
strength
into
my
as
long
as
we
remain
true
to
the
divine
mother
so
long
will
she
remain
faithful
to
her
suffering
children
at
that
period
my
love
for
canada
was
a
feeling
very
nearly
allied
to
that
which
the
condemned
criminal
entertains
for
his
cell
his
only
hope
of
escape
being
through
the
portals
of
the
grave
the
fall
rains
had
commenced
in
a
few
days
the
cold
wintry
showers
swept
all
the
gorgeous
crimson
from
the
trees
and
a
bleak
and
desolate
waste
presented
itself
to
the
shuddering
spectator
but
in
spite
of
wind
and
rain
my
little
tenement
was
never
free
from
the
intrusion
of
uncle
joe
wife
and
children
their
house
stood
about
a
from
the
hut
we
occupied
in
the
same
meadow
and
they
seemed
to
look
upon
it
still
as
their
own
although
we
had
literally
paid
for
it
twice
over
fine
strapping
girls
they
were
from
five
years
old
to
fourteen
but
rude
and
unnurtured
as
so
many
bears
they
would
come
in
without
the
least
ceremony
and
young
as
they
were
ask
me
a
thousand
impertinent
questions
and
when
i
civilly
requested
them
to
leave
the
room
they
would
range
themselves
upon
the
watching
my
motions
with
their
black
eyes
gleaming
upon
me
through
their
tangled
uncombed
locks
their
company
was
a
great
annoyance
for
it
obliged
me
to
put
a
painful
restraint
upon
the
thoughtfulness
in
which
it
was
so
delightful
to
me
to
indulge
their
visits
were
not
visits
of
love
but
of
mere
idle
curiosity
not
unmingled
with
malicious
pleasure
at
my
awkward
attempts
at
canadian
the
simplicity
the
fond
confiding
faith
of
childhood
is
unknown
in
canada
there
are
no
children
here
the
boy
is
a
miniature
man
knowing
keen
and
wide
awake
as
able
to
drive
a
bargain
and
take
an
advantage
of
his
juvenile
companion
as
the
man
the
girl
a
gossipping
flirt
full
of
vanity
and
affectation
with
a
premature
love
of
finery
and
an
acute
perception
of
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
wealth
and
from
keeping
up
a
certain
appearance
in
the
world
the
flowers
the
green
grass
the
glorious
sunshine
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
young
lambs
gambolling
down
the
verdant
slopes
which
fill
the
heart
of
a
british
child
with
a
fond
ecstacy
bathing
the
young
spirit
in
elysium
would
float
unnoticed
before
the
vision
of
a
canadian
child
while
the
sight
of
a
dollar
or
a
new
dress
or
a
gay
bonnet
would
swell
its
proud
bosom
with
and
delight
the
glorious
blush
of
modest
diffidence
the
tear
of
gentle
sympathy
are
so
rare
on
the
cheek
or
in
the
eye
of
the
young
that
their
appearance
creates
a
feeling
of
surprise
such
perfect
in
beings
so
new
to
the
world
is
painful
to
a
thinking
mind
it
betrays
a
great
want
of
sensibility
and
mental
culture
and
a
melancholy
knowledge
of
the
arts
of
life
for
a
week
i
was
alone
my
good
scotch
girl
having
left
me
to
visit
her
father
some
small
were
needed
to
be
washed
and
after
making
a
great
preparation
i
determined
to
try
my
unskilled
hand
upon
the
operation
the
fact
is
i
knew
nothing
about
the
task
i
had
imposed
upon
myself
and
in
a
few
minutes
rubbed
the
skin
off
my
wrists
without
getting
the
clothes
clean
the
door
was
open
as
it
generally
was
even
during
the
coldest
winter
days
in
order
to
let
in
more
light
and
let
out
the
smoke
which
otherwise
would
have
enveloped
us
like
a
cloud
i
was
so
busy
that
i
did
not
perceive
that
i
was
watched
by
the
cold
heavy
dark
eyes
of
joe
who
with
a
sneering
laugh
exclaimed
well
thank
god
i
am
glad
to
see
you
brought
to
work
at
last
i
hope
you
may
have
to
work
as
hard
as
i
have
i
do
see
not
i
why
you
who
are
no
better
than
me
should
sit
still
all
day
like
a
lady
mrs
r
said
i
not
a
little
annoyed
at
her
presence
what
concern
is
it
of
yours
whether
i
work
or
sit
still
i
never
interfere
with
you
if
you
took
it
into
your
head
to
lie
in
bed
all
day
i
should
never
trouble
myself
about
ah
i
guess
you
do
look
upon
us
as
you
are
so
proud
and
grand
i
you
britishers
are
not
made
of
flesh
and
blood
like
us
you
do
choose
to
sit
down
at
meat
with
your
helps
now
i
calculate
we
think
them
a
great
deal
better
nor
of
course
said
i
they
are
more
suited
to
you
than
we
are
they
are
uneducated
and
so
are
you
this
is
no
fault
in
either
but
it
might
teach
you
to
pay
a
little
more
respect
to
those
who
are
possessed
of
superior
advantages
but
r
my
helps
as
you
call
them
are
civil
and
obliging
and
never
make
unprovoked
and
malicious
speeches
if
they
could
so
far
forget
themselves
i
should
order
them
to
leave
the
oh
i
see
what
you
are
up
to
replied
the
insolent
dame
you
mean
to
say
that
if
i
were
your
help
you
would
turn
me
out
of
your
house
but
i
a
american
and
i
wo
go
at
your
bidding
think
i
came
here
out
of
regard
to
you
no
i
hate
you
all
and
i
rejoice
to
see
you
at
the
and
i
wish
that
you
may
be
brought
down
upon
your
knees
to
scrub
the
this
speech
only
caused
a
smile
and
yet
i
felt
hurt
and
astonished
that
a
woman
whom
i
had
never
done
anything
to
offend
should
be
so
gratuitously
spiteful
in
the
evening
she
sent
two
of
her
brood
over
to
borrow
my
long
iron
as
she
called
an
italian
iron
i
was
just
getting
my
baby
to
sleep
sitting
upon
a
low
stool
by
the
fire
i
pointed
to
the
iron
upon
the
shelf
and
told
the
girl
to
take
it
she
did
so
but
stood
beside
me
holding
it
carelessly
in
her
hand
and
staring
at
the
baby
who
had
just
sunk
to
sleep
upon
my
lap
the
next
moment
the
heavy
iron
fell
from
her
relaxed
grasp
giving
me
a
severe
blow
upon
my
knee
and
foot
and
glanced
so
near
the
child
head
that
it
drew
from
me
a
cry
of
terror
i
guess
that
was
nigh
braining
the
child
quoth
miss
amanda
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
without
making
the
least
apology
master
ammon
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
if
it
had
mandy
i
guess
we
have
cotched
provoked
at
their
insolence
i
told
them
to
leave
the
house
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
for
i
felt
that
had
they
injured
the
child
it
would
not
have
caused
them
the
least
regret
the
next
day
as
we
were
standing
at
the
door
my
husband
was
greatly
amused
by
seeing
fat
uncle
joe
chasing
the
rebellious
ammon
over
the
meadow
in
front
of
the
house
joe
was
out
of
breath
panting
and
puffing
like
a
small
and
his
face
flushed
to
deep
red
with
excitement
and
passion
you
young
scoundrel
he
cried
half
choked
with
fury
if
i
catch
up
to
you
i
take
the
skin
off
you
you
old
scoundrel
you
may
have
my
skin
if
you
can
get
at
me
retorted
the
precocious
child
as
he
jumped
up
upon
the
top
of
the
high
fence
and
doubled
his
fist
in
a
menacing
manner
at
his
father
that
boy
is
growing
too
bad
said
uncle
joe
coming
up
to
us
out
of
breath
the
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
it
is
time
to
break
him
in
or
he
get
the
master
of
us
you
should
have
begun
that
before
said
moodie
he
seems
a
hopeful
oh
as
to
that
a
little
swearing
is
manly
returned
the
father
i
swear
myself
i
know
and
as
the
old
cock
crows
so
crows
the
young
one
it
is
not
his
swearing
that
i
care
a
pin
for
but
he
will
not
do
a
thing
i
tell
him
swearing
is
a
dreadful
vice
said
i
and
wicked
as
it
is
in
the
mouth
of
a
person
it
is
perfectly
shocking
in
a
child
it
painfully
tells
he
has
been
brought
up
without
the
fear
of
pooh
pooh
that
all
cant
there
is
no
harm
in
a
few
oaths
and
i
can
not
drive
oxen
and
horses
without
swearing
i
dare
say
that
you
can
swear
too
when
you
are
riled
but
you
are
too
cunning
to
let
us
hear
i
could
not
help
laughing
outright
at
this
supposition
but
replied
very
quietly
those
who
practice
such
iniquities
never
take
any
pains
to
conceal
them
the
concealment
would
infer
a
feeling
of
shame
and
when
people
are
conscious
of
the
guilt
they
are
in
the
road
to
the
man
walked
whistling
away
and
the
wicked
child
returned
unpunished
to
his
home
the
next
minute
the
old
woman
came
in
i
guess
you
can
give
me
a
piece
of
silk
for
a
hood
said
she
the
weather
is
growing
considerable
surely
it
can
not
well
be
colder
than
it
is
at
present
said
i
giving
her
the
by
the
fire
wait
a
while
you
know
nothing
of
a
canadian
winter
this
is
only
november
after
the
christmas
thaw
you
know
something
about
the
cold
it
is
years
ago
since
i
and
my
man
left
the
states
it
was
called
the
year
of
the
great
winter
i
tell
you
woman
that
the
snow
lay
so
deep
on
the
earth
that
it
blocked
up
all
the
roads
and
we
could
drive
a
sleigh
whither
we
pleased
right
over
the
snake
fences
all
the
cleared
land
was
one
wide
white
level
plain
it
was
a
year
of
scarcity
and
we
were
half
starved
but
the
severe
cold
was
far
worse
nor
the
want
of
provisions
a
long
and
bitter
journey
we
had
of
it
but
i
was
young
then
and
pretty
well
used
to
trouble
and
fatigue
my
man
stuck
to
the
british
government
more
fool
he
i
was
an
american
born
and
my
heart
was
with
the
true
cause
but
his
father
was
english
and
says
he
live
and
die
under
their
flag
so
he
dragged
me
from
my
comfortable
fireside
to
seek
a
home
in
the
far
canadian
wilderness
trouble
i
guess
you
think
you
have
your
troubles
but
what
are
they
to
mine
she
paused
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
offered
me
the
box
sighed
painfully
pushed
the
red
handkerchief
from
her
high
narrow
wrinkled
brow
and
continued
joe
was
a
baby
then
and
i
had
another
helpless
critter
in
my
lap
an
adopted
child
my
sister
had
died
from
it
and
i
was
nursing
it
at
the
same
breast
with
my
boy
well
we
had
to
perform
a
journey
of
four
hundred
miles
in
an
which
carried
besides
me
and
the
children
all
our
household
stuff
our
way
lay
chiefly
through
the
forest
and
we
made
but
slow
progress
oh
what
a
bitter
cold
night
it
was
when
we
reached
the
swampy
woods
where
the
city
of
rochester
now
stands
the
oxen
were
covered
with
icicles
and
their
breath
sent
up
clouds
of
steam
says
i
to
my
man
must
stop
and
kindle
a
fire
i
am
dead
with
cold
and
i
fear
the
babes
will
be
frozen
we
began
looking
about
for
a
good
spot
to
camp
in
when
i
spied
a
light
through
the
trees
it
was
a
lone
shanty
occupied
by
two
french
lumberers
the
men
were
kind
they
rubbed
our
frozen
limbs
with
snow
and
shared
with
us
their
supper
and
buffalo
skins
on
that
very
spot
where
we
camped
that
night
where
we
heard
nothing
but
the
wind
soughing
amongst
the
trees
and
the
rushing
of
the
river
now
stands
the
great
city
of
rochester
i
went
there
two
years
ago
to
the
funeral
of
a
brother
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
dream
where
we
foddered
our
beasts
by
the
shanty
fire
now
stands
the
largest
hotel
in
the
city
and
my
husband
left
this
fine
growing
country
to
starve
i
was
so
much
interested
in
the
old
woman
narrative
for
she
was
really
possessed
of
no
ordinary
capacity
and
though
rude
and
uneducated
might
have
been
a
very
superior
person
under
different
circumstances
that
i
rummaged
among
my
store
and
soon
found
a
piece
of
black
silk
which
i
gave
her
for
the
hood
she
required
the
old
woman
examined
it
carefully
over
smiled
to
herself
but
like
all
her
people
was
too
proud
to
return
a
word
of
thanks
one
gift
to
the
family
always
involved
another
have
you
any
or
black
to
give
me
to
quilt
it
with
humph
returned
the
old
dame
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
contradict
my
assertion
she
then
settled
herself
in
her
chair
and
after
shaking
her
foot
awhile
and
fixing
her
piercing
eyes
upon
me
for
some
minutes
she
commenced
the
following
list
of
interrogatories
is
your
father
alive
no
he
died
many
years
ago
when
i
was
a
young
is
your
mother
alive
what
is
her
name
i
satisfied
her
on
this
point
did
she
ever
marry
again
she
might
have
done
so
but
she
loved
her
husband
too
well
and
preferred
living
humph
we
have
no
such
notions
here
what
was
your
father
a
gentleman
who
lived
upon
his
own
did
he
die
rich
he
lost
the
greater
part
of
his
property
from
being
surety
for
that
a
foolish
business
my
man
burnt
his
fingers
with
that
and
what
brought
you
out
to
this
poor
country
you
who
are
no
more
fit
for
it
than
i
am
to
be
a
fine
lady
the
promise
of
a
large
grant
of
land
and
the
false
statements
we
heard
regarding
do
you
like
the
country
no
and
i
fear
i
never
i
thought
not
for
the
drop
is
always
on
your
cheek
the
children
tell
me
and
those
young
ones
have
keen
eyes
now
take
my
advice
return
while
your
money
lasts
the
longer
you
remain
in
canada
the
less
you
will
like
it
and
when
your
money
is
all
spent
you
will
be
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
you
may
beat
your
wings
against
the
bars
but
you
ca
get
there
was
a
long
pause
i
hoped
that
my
guest
had
sufficiently
gratified
her
curiosity
when
she
again
commenced
how
do
you
get
your
money
do
you
draw
it
from
the
old
country
or
have
you
it
with
you
in
cash
provoked
by
her
pertinacity
and
seeing
no
end
to
her
i
replied
very
impatiently
mrs
r
is
it
the
custom
in
your
country
to
catechise
strangers
whenever
you
meet
with
them
what
do
you
mean
she
said
colouring
i
believe
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
mean
quoth
i
an
evil
habit
of
asking
impertinent
the
old
woman
got
up
and
left
the
house
without
speaking
another
word
the
is
merry
to
hear
at
evening
time
by
the
blazing
hearth
the
chime
to
know
the
bounding
steeds
bring
near
the
loved
one
to
our
bosom
dear
ah
lightly
we
spring
the
fire
to
raise
till
the
rafters
glow
with
the
ruddy
blaze
those
merry
our
hearts
keep
time
responsive
to
their
fairy
chime
vale
and
hill
their
welcome
notes
are
trembling
still
is
he
and
blithely
the
gay
bells
sound
as
glides
his
sleigh
the
frozen
ground
hark
he
has
pass
the
dark
pine
wood
he
crosses
now
the
flood
and
hails
the
light
at
the
open
door
that
tells
his
toilsome
journey
the
merry
my
fond
heart
swells
and
throbs
to
hear
the
welcome
bells
ice
and
snow
a
voice
of
gladness
on
they
go
our
hut
is
small
and
rude
our
cheer
but
love
has
spread
the
banquet
here
and
childhood
springs
to
be
by
our
beloved
and
welcome
guest
with
a
smiling
brow
his
tale
he
tells
the
urchins
ring
the
merry
the
merry
with
shout
and
song
they
drag
the
noisy
string
along
the

the
gay
bells

his
welcome
home
from
the
the
gaunt
wolves

from

loud
whoops
the

in
thunder
past
the
forest
creaks
beneath
the
blast
no
more

list
with
boding
fear
the
distant
chime
to
hear
the
merry
with
soothing
power
shed
gladness
on
the
evening
hour
what
rapture
swells
the
music
of
those
joyous
bells
many
versions
have
been
given
of
this

john
monaghan
dear
mother
nature
on
thy
ample
breast
hast
thou
not
room
for
thy
neglected
son
a
stern
necessity
has
driven
him
forth
alone
and
friendless
he
has
naught
but
thee
and
the
strong
hand
and
stronger
heart
thou
gavest
to
win
with
patient
toil
his
daily
a
few
days
after
the
old
woman
visit
to
the
cottage
our
servant
james
absented
himself
for
a
week
without
asking
leave
or
giving
any
intimation
of
his
intention
he
had
under
his
care
a
fine
pair
of
horses
a
yoke
of
oxen
three
cows
and
a
numerous
family
of
pigs
besides
having
to
chop
all
the
firewood
required
for
our
use
his
unexpected
departure
caused
no
small
trouble
in
the
family
and
when
the
truant
at
last
made
his
appearance
moodie
discharged
him
altogether
the
winter
had
now
fairly
set
in
the
iron
winter
of
the
snow
was
unusually
deep
and
it
being
our
first
winter
in
canada
and
passed
in
such
a
miserable
dwelling
we
felt
it
very
severely
in
spite
of
all
my
boasted
fortitude
and
i
think
my
powers
of
endurance
have
been
tried
to
the
uttermost
since
my
sojourn
in
this
country
the
rigour
of
the
climate
subdued
my
proud
independent
english
spirit
and
i
actually
shamed
my
womanhood
and
cried
with
the
cold
yes
i
ought
to
blush
at
evincing
such
unpardonable
weakness
but
i
was
foolish
and
inexperienced
and
unaccustomed
to
the
yoke
my
husband
did
not
much
relish
performing
the
menial
duties
of
a
servant
in
such
weather
but
he
did
not
complain
and
in
the
meantime
commenced
an
active
inquiry
for
a
man
to
supply
the
place
of
the
one
we
had
lost
but
at
that
season
of
the
year
no
one
was
to
be
had
it
was
a
bitter
freezing
night
a
sharp
wind
howled
without
and
drove
the
fine
snow
through
the
chinks
in
the
door
almost
to
the
on
which
two
immense
blocks
of
maple
shed
forth
a
cheering
glow
brightening
the
narrow
and
making
the
blackened
rafters
ruddy
with
the
blaze
the
toils
of
the
day
were
over
the
supper
things
cleared
away
and
the
door
closed
for
the
night
moodie
had
taken
up
his
flute
the
sweet
companion
of
happier
days
at
the
earnest
request
of
our
homesick
scotch
to
cheer
her
drooping
spirits
by
playing
some
of
the
touching
national
airs
of
the
glorious
mountain
land
the
land
of
chivalry
and
song
the
heroic
north
before
retiring
to
rest
bell
who
had
an
exquisite
ear
for
music
kept
time
with
foot
and
hand
while
large
tears
gathered
in
her
soft
blue
eyes
ay
is
bonnie
thae
songs
but
they
mak
me
greet
an
my
puir
heart
is
sair
sair
when
i
think
on
the
bonnie
braes
and
the
days
poor
bell
her
heart
was
among
the
hills
and
mine
had
wandered
far
far
away
to
the
green
groves
and
meadows
of
my
own
fair
land
the
music
and
our
reveries
were
alike
abruptly
banished
by
a
sharp
blow
upon
the
door
bell
rose
and
opened
it
when
a
strange
lad
barefooted
and
with
no
other
covering
to
his
head
than
the
thick
matted
locks
of
raven
blackness
that
hung
like
a
cloud
over
his
swarthy
sunburnt
visage
burst
into
the
room
guidness

us
wha
we
here
screamed
bell
retreating
into
a
corner
the
puir
callant
no
my
husband
turned
hastily
round
to
meet
the
intruder
and
i
raised
the
candle
from
the
table
the
better
to
distinguish
his
face
while
bell
from
her
regarded
him
with
unequivocal
glances
of
fear
and
mistrust
waving
her
hands
to
me
and
pointing
significantly
to
the
open
door
as
if
silently
beseeching
me
to
tell
her
master
to
turn
him
out
shut
the
door
man
said
moodie
whose
long
scrutiny
of
the
strange
being
before
us
seemed
upon
the
whole
satisfactory
we
shall
be
thin

sir
that
what
i
am
said
the
lad
in
a
rich
brogue
which
told
without
asking
the
country
to
which
he
belonged
then
stretching
his
bare
hands
to
the
fire
he
continued
by
jove
sir
i
was
never
so
near
gone
in
my
life
where
do
you
come
from
and
what
is
your
business
here
you
must
be
aware
that
this
is
a
very
late
hour
to
take
a
house
by
storm
in
this
thrue
for
you
sir
but
necessity
knows
no
law
and
the
condition
you
see
me
in
must
plade
for

bell
was
as
obstinate
as
a
rock
not
only
refusing
to
put
down
any
food
for
the
famished
lad
but
reiterating
her
threat
of
leaving
the
house
if
he
were
suffered
to
remain
my
husband
no
longer
able
to
endure
her
selfish
and
absurd
conduct
got
angry
in
good
earnest
and
told
her
that
she
might
please
herself
that
he
did
not
mean
to
ask
her
leave
as
to
whom
he
received
into
his
house
i
for
my
part
had
no
idea
that
she
would
realise
her
threat
she
was
an
excellent
servant
clean
honest
and
industrious
and
loved
the
dear
baby
you
will
think
better
of
it
in
the
morning
said
i
as
i
rose
and
placed
before
the
lad
some
cold
beef
and
bread
and
a
bowl
of
milk
to
which
the
runaway
did
ample
justice
why
did
you
quit
your
master
my
lad
said
moodie
because
i
could
live
wid
him
no
longer
you
see
sir
i
a
poor
foundling
from
the
belfast
asylum
shoved
out
by
the
mother
that
bore
me
upon
the
wide
wurld
long
before
i
knew
that
i
was
in
it
as
i
was
too
young
to
spake
for
myself
intirely
she
put
me
into
a
basket
wid
a
label
round
my
neck
to
tell
the
folks
that
my
name
was
john
monaghan
this
was
all
i
ever
got
from
my
parents
and
who
or
what
they
were
i
never
knew
not
i
for
they
never
claimed
me
bad
cess
to
them
but
i
no
doubt
it
a
fine
illigant
gintleman
he
was
and
herself
a
handsome
rich
young
lady
who
dared
not
own
me
for
fear
of
affronting
the
rich
jintry
her
father
and
mother
poor
folk
sir
are
never
ashamed
of
their
children
is
all
the
threasure
they
have
sir
but
my
parents
were
ashamed
of
me
and
they
thrust
me
out
to
the
stranger
and
the
hard
bread
of
the
poor
lad
signed
deeply
and
i
began
to
feel
a
growing
interest
in
his
sad
history
have
you
been
in
the
country
long
four
years
madam
you
know
my
masther
f
he
brought
me
out
wid
him
as
his
apprentice
and
during
the
voyage
he
trated
me
well
but
the
young
men
his
sons
are
tyrants
and
full
of
durty
pride
and
i
could
not
agree
wid
them
at
all
at
all
yesterday
i
forgot
to
take
the
oxen
out
of
the
yoke
and
musther
william
tied
me
up
to
a
stump
and
bate
me
with
the
raw
hide
shure
the
marks
are
on
me
showlthers
yet
i
left
the
oxen
and
the
yoke
and
turned
my
back
upon
them
all
for
the
hot
blood
was
bilin
widin
me
and
i
felt
that
if
i
stayed
it
would
be
him
that
would
get
the
worst
of
it
no
one
had
ever
cared
for
me
since
i
was
born
so
i
thought
it
was
high
time
to
take
care
of
myself
i
had
heard
your
name
sir
and
i
thought
i
would
find
you
out
and
if
you
want
a
lad
i
will
work
for
you
for
my
kape
and
a
few
dacent
a
bargain
was
soon
made
moodie
agreed
to
give
monaghan
six
dollars
a
month
which
he
thankfully
accepted
and
i
told
bell
to
prepare
his
bed
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
but
mistress
bell
thought
fit
to
rebel
having
been
guilty
of
one
act
of
insubordination
she
determined
to
be
consistent
and
throw
off
the
yoke
altogether
she
declared
that
she
would
do
no
such
thing
that
her
life
and
that
all
our
lives
were
in
danger
and
that
she
would
never
stay
another
night
under
the
same
roof
with
that
papist
vagabond
papist
cried
the
indignant
lad
his
dark
eyes
flashing
fire
no
papist
but
a
protestant
like
yourself
and
i
hope
a
deuced
dale
better
christian
you
take
me
for
a
thief
yet
shure
a
thief
would
have
waited
till
you
were
all
in
bed
and
asleep
and
not
stepped
in
forenint
you
all
in
this
there
was
both
truth
and
nature
in
the
lad
argument
but
bell
like
an
obstinate
woman
as
she
was
chose
to
adhere
to
her
own
opinion
nay
she
even
carried
her
absurd
prejudices
so
far
that
she
brought
her
mattress
and
laid
it
down
on
the
floor
in
my
room
for
fear
that
the
irish
vagabond
should
murder
her
during
the
night
by
the
break
of
day
she
was
off
leaving
me
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
without
a
servant
monaghan
did
all
in
his
power
to
supply
her
place
he
lighted
the
fires
swept
the
house
milked
the
cows
nursed
the
baby
and
often
cooked
the
dinner
for
me
and
endeavoured
by
a
thousand
little
attentions
to
show
the
gratitude
he
really
felt
for
our
kindness
to
little
katie
he
attached
himself
in
an
extraordinary
manner
all
his
spare
time
he
spent
in
making
little
sleighs
and
toys
for
her
or
in
dragging
her
in
the
said
sleighs
up
and
down
the
steep
hills
in
front
of
the
house
wrapped
up
in
a
blanket
of
a
night
he
cooked
her
mess
of
bread
and
milk
as
she
sat
by
the
fire
and
his
greatest
delight
was
to
feed
her
himself
after
this
operation
was
over
he
would
carry
her
round
the
floor
on
his
back
and
sing
her
songs
in
native
irish
katie
always
greeted
his
return
from
the
woods
with
a
scream
of
joy
holding
up
her
fair
arms
to
clasp
the
neck
of
her
dark
favourite
now
the
lord
love
you
for
a
darlint
he
would
cry
as
he
caught
her
to
his
heart
shure
you
are
the
only
one
of
the
crathers
he
ever
made
who
can
love
poor
john
monaghan
brothers
and
sisters
i
have
none
i
stand
alone
in
the
wurld
and
your
bonny
wee
face
is
the
sweetest
thing
it
contains
for
me
och
jewil
i
could
lay
down
my
life
for
you
and
be
proud
to
do
that
though
careless
and
reckless
about
everything
that
concerned
himself
john
was
honest
and
true
he
loved
us
for
the
compassion
we
had
shown
him
and
he
would
have
resented
any
injury
offered
to
our
persons
with
his
best
blood
but
if
we
were
pleased
with
our
new
servant
uncle
joe
and
his
family
were
not
and
they
commenced
a
series
of
petty
persecutions
that
annoyed
him
greatly
and
kindled
into
a
flame
all
the
fiery
particles
of
his
irritable
nature
moodie
had
purchased
several
tons
of
hay
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
for
the
use
of
his
cattle
and
it
had
to
be
stowed
into
the
same
barn
with
some
flax
and
straw
that
belonged
to
uncle
joe
going
early
one
morning
to
fodder
the
cattle
john
found
uncle
joe
feeding
his
cows
with
his
master
hay
and
as
it
had
diminished
greatly
in
a
very
short
time
he
accused
him
in
no
measured
terms
of
being
the
thief
the
other
very
coolly
replied
that
he
had
taken
a
little
of
the
hay
in
order
to
repay
himself
for
his
flax
that
monaghan
had
stolen
for
the
oxen
now
by
the
powers
quoth
john
kindling
into
wrath
that
is
adding
a
big
lie
to
a
dirthy
petty
larceny
i
take
your
flax
you
ould
villain
shure
i
know
that
flax
is
grown
to
make
linen
wid
not
to
feed
oxen
god
almighty
has
given
the
crathers
a
good
warm
coat
of
their
own
they
neither
require
shifts
nor
i
saw
you
take
it
you
ragged
irish
vagabond
with
my
own
thin
yer
two
eyes
showed
you
a
wicked
illusion
you
had
betther
shut
up
yer
head
or
i
give
you
that
for
an
that
shall
make
you
see
thrue
for
the
time
to
relying
upon
his
great
size
and
thinking
that
the
slight
stripling
who
was
all
bones
and
sinews
was
no
match
for
him
uncle
joe
struck
monaghan
over
the
head
with
the
pitchfork
in
a
moment
the
active
lad
was
upon
him
like
a
wild
cat
and
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
his
age
and
weight
gave
the
big
man
such
a
thorough
dressing
that
he
was
fain
to
roar
aloud
for
mercy
own
that
you
are
a
thief
and
a
liar
or
i
murther
you
i
own
to
anything
whilst
your
knee
is
pressing
me
into
a
pancake
come
now
there
a
good
lad
let
me
get
monaghan
felt
irresolute
but
after
extorting
from
uncle
joe
a
promise
never
to
purloin
any
of
the
hay
again
he
let
him
rise
for
shure
he
said
he
began
to
turn
so
black
in
the
face
i
thought
he
burst
the
fat
man
neither
forgot
nor
forgave
this
injury
and
though
he
dared
not
attack
john
personally
he
set
the
children
to
insult
and
affront
him
upon
all
occasions
the
boy
was
without
socks
and
i
sent
him
to
old
r
to
inquire
of
her
what
she
would
charge
for
knitting
him
two
pairs
of
socks
the
reply
was
a
dollar
this
was
agreed
to
and
dear
enough
they
were
but
the
weather
was
very
cold
and
the
lad
was
barefooted
and
there
was
no
other
alternative
than
either
to
accept
her
offer
or
for
him
to
go
without
in
a
few
days
monaghan
brought
them
home
but
i
found
upon
inspecting
them
that
they
were
old
socks
this
was
rather
too
glaring
a
cheat
and
i
sent
the
lad
back
with
them
and
told
him
to
inform
r
that
as
he
had
agreed
to
give
the
price
for
new
socks
he
expected
them
to
be
new
altogether
the
avaricious
old
woman
did
not
deny
the
fact
but
she
fell
to
cursing
and
swearing
in
an
awful
manner
and
wished
so
much
evil
to
the
lad
that
with
the
superstitious
fear
so
common
to
the
natives
of
his
country
he
left
her
under
the
impression
that
she
was
gifted
with
the
evil
eye
and
was
an
owld
he
never
went
out
of
the
yard
with
the
waggon
and
horses
but
she
rushed
to
the
door
and
cursed
him
for
a
irish
blackguard
and
wished
that
he
might
overturn
the
waggon
kill
the
horses
and
break
his
own
worthless
neck
said
john
to
me
one
day
after
returning
from
c
with
the
team
it
would
be
betther
for
me
to
lave
the
masther
intirely
for
shure
if
i
do
not
some
mischief
will
befall
me
or
the
crathers
that
wicked
owld
wretch
i
can
not
thole
her
curses
shure
it
in
purgatory
i
am
all
the
nonsense
monaghan
you
are
not
a
catholic
and
need
not
fear
purgatory
the
next
time
the
old
woman
commences
her
reprobate
conduct
tell
her
to
hold
her
tongue
and
mind
her
own
business
for
curses
like
chickens
come
home
to
the
boy
laughed
heartily
at
the
old
turkish
proverb
but
did
not
reckon
much
on
its
efficacy
to
still
the
clamorous
tongue
of
the
old
jade
the
next
day
he
had
to
pass
her
door
with
the
horses
no
sooner
did
she
hear
the
sound
of
the
wheels
than
out
she
hobbled
and
commenced
her
usual
anathemas
bad
luck
to
yer
croaking
yer
owld
raven
it
is
not
me
you
are
desthroying
shure
but
yer
own
poor
miserable
sinful
sowl
the
owld
one
has
the
grief
of
ye
already
for
like
chickens
come
home
to
roost
so
get
in
wid
ye
and
hatch
them
to
yerself
in
the
chimley
corner
they
all
be
roosting
wid
ye
and
a
nice
warm
nest
they
make
for
you
considering
the
brave
brood
that
belongs
to
whether
the
old
woman
was
as
superstitious
as
john
i
know
not
or
whether
she
was
impressed
with
the
moral
truth
of
the
proverb
for
as
i
have
before
stated
she
was
no
fool
is
difficult
to
tell
but
she
shrunk
back
into
her
den
and
never
attacked
the
lad
again
poor
john
bore
no
malice
in
his
heart
not
he
for
in
spite
of
all
the
things
he
had
to
endure
from
uncle
joe
and
his
family
he
never
attempted
to
return
evil
for
evil
in
proof
of
this
he
was
one
day
chopping
firewood
in
the
bush
at
some
distance
from
joe
who
was
engaged
in
the
same
employment
with
another
man
a
tree
in
falling
caught
upon
another
which
although
a
very
large
maple
was
hollow
and
very
much
decayed
and
liable
to
be
blown
down
by
the
least
shock
of
the
wind
the
tree
hung
directly
over
the
path
that
uncle
joe
was
obliged
to
traverse
daily
with
his
team
he
looked
up
and
perceived
from
the
situation
it
occupied
that
it
was
necessary
for
his
own
safety
to
cut
it
down
but
he
lacked
courage
to
undertake
so
hazardous
a
job
which
might
be
attended
if
the
supporting
tree
gave
way
during
the
operation
with
very
serious
consequences
in
a
careless
tone
he
called
to
his
companion
to
cut
down
the
tree
do
it
yourself
h
said
the
axe
man
with
a
grin
my
wife
and
children
want
their
man
as
much
as
your
hannah
wants
i
not
put
axe
to
it
quoth
joe
then
making
signs
to
his
comrade
to
hold
his
tongue
he
shouted
to
monaghan
hollo
boy
you
wanted
here
to
cut
down
this
tree
do
you
see
that
your
master
cattle
might
be
killed
if
they
should
happen
to
pass
under
it
and
it
should
fall
upon
thrue
for
you
masther
joe
but
your
own
cattle
would
have
the
first
chance
why
should
i
risk
my
life
and
limbs
by
cutting
down
the
tree
when
it
was
yerself
that
threw
it
so
awkwardly
over
the
other
oh
but
you
are
a
boy
and
have
no
wife
and
children
to
depend
upon
you
for
bread
said
joe
gravely
we
are
both
family
men
you
see
that
is
your
duty
to
cut
down
the
tree
the
lad
swung
the
axe
to
and
fro
in
his
hand
eyeing
joe
and
the
tree
alternately
but
the
natural
of
the
creature
and
his
reckless
courage
overcame
all
idea
of
and
raising
aloft
his
slender
but
muscular
arm
he
cried
out
if
it
a
life
that
must
be
sacrificed
why
not
mine
as
well
as
another
here
goes
and
the
lord
have
mercy
on
my
sinful
sowl
the
tree
fell
and
contrary
to
their
expectations
without
any
injury
to
john
the
knowing
yankee
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
well
if
you
ar
a
tarnation
soft
fool
i
never
saw
what
do
you
mane
exclaimed
john
his
dark
eyes
flashing
fire
if
is
to
insult
me
for
doing
that
which
neither
of
you
dared
to
do
you
had
better
not
thry
that
same
you
have
just
seen
the
strength
of
my
spirit
you
had
better
not
thry
again
the
strength
of
my
arm
or
may
be
you
and
the
tree
would
chance
to
share
the
same
fate
and
shouldering
his
axe
the
boy
strode
down
the
hill
to
get
scolded
by
me
for
his
foolhardiness
the
first
week
of
march
all
the
people
were
busy
making
maple
sugar
did
you
ever
taste
any
maple
sugar
asked
monaghan
as
he
sat
feeding
katie
one
evening
by
the
fire
no
well
then
you
a
thrate
to
come
and
it
myself
that
will
make
miss
katie
the
darlint
an
illigant
lump
of
that
early
in
the
morning
john
was
up
hard
at
work
making
troughs
for
the
sap
by
noon
he
had
completed
a
dozen
which
he
showed
me
with
great
pride
of
heart
i
felt
a
little
curious
about
this
maple
sugar
and
asked
a
thousand
questions
about
the
use
to
which
the
troughs
were
to
be
applied
how
the
trees
were
to
be
tapped
the
sugar
made
and
if
it
were
really
good
when
made
to
all
my
queries
john
responded
och
is
illigant
it
bates
all
the
sugar
that
ever
was
made
in
jamaky
but
you
see
before
moodie
was
away
at
p
and
the
prospect
of
the
maple
sugar
relieved
the
dulness
occasioned
by
his
absence
i
reckoned
on
showing
him
a
piece
of
sugar
of
our
own
making
when
he
came
home
and
never
dreamt
of
the
possibility
of
disappointment
john
tapped
his
trees
after
the
most
approved
fashion
and
set
his
troughts
to
catch
the
sap
but
miss
amanda
and
master
ammon
upset
them
as
fast
as
they
filled
and
spilt
all
the
sap
with
great
difficulty
monaghan
saved
the
contents
of
one
large
iron
pot
this
he
brought
in
about
nightfall
and
made
up
a
roaring
fire
in
order
to
boil
in
down
into
sugar
hour
after
hour
passed
away
and
the
looked
as
hot
and
black
as
the
stoker
in
a
many
times
i
peeped
into
the
large
pot
but
the
sap
never
seemed
to
diminish
this
is
a
tedious
piece
of
business
thought
i
but
seeing
the
lad
so
anxious
i
said
nothing
about
twelve
he
asked
me
very
mysteriously
for
a
piece
of
pork
to
hang
over
the
sugar
pork
said
i
looking
into
the
pot
which
was
half
full
of
a
very
liquid
what
do
you
want
with
pork
shure
an
is
to
keep
the
sugar
from
but
john
i
see
no
sugar
och
but
is
all
sugar
only
is
molasses
jist
now
see
how
it
sticks
to
the
ladle
aha
but
miss
katie
will
have
the
fine
lumps
of
sugar
when
she
awakes
in
the
i
grew
so
tired
and
sleepy
that
i
left
john
to
finish
his
job
went
to
bed
and
soon
forgot
all
about
the
maple
sugar
at
breakfast
i
observed
a
small
plate
upon
the
table
placed
in
a
very
conspicuous
manner
on
the
the
bottom
covered
with
a
hard
black
substance
which
very
much
resembled
pitch
what
is
that
stuff
john
shure
an
is
the
maple
can
people
eat
that
by
dad
an
they
can
only
thry
it
why
is
so
hard
i
can
not
cut
with
some
difficulty
and
not
without
cutting
his
finger
john
broke
a
piece
off
and
stuffed
it
into
the
baby
mouth
the
poor
child
made
a
horrible
face
and
rejected
it
as
if
it
had
been
poison
for
my
own
part
i
never
tasted
anything
more
nauseous
it
tasted
like
a
compound
of
pork
grease
and
tobacco
juice
well
monaghan
if
this
be
maple
sugar
i
never
wish
to
taste
any
och
bad
luck
to
it
said
the
lad
flinging
it
away
plate
and
all
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
dirthy
pot
and
the
blackguard
cinders
and
its
burning
to
the
bottom
of
the
pot
that
owld
hag
r
bewitched
it
with
her
evil
she
is
not
so
clever
as
you
think
john
said
i
laughing
you
have
forgotten
how
to
make
the
sugar
since
you
left
d
but
let
us
forget
the
maple
sugar
and
think
of
something
else
had
you
not
better
get
old
r
to
mend
that
jacket
for
you
it
is
too
ay
dad
an
it
mysel
is
the
illigant
tailor
was
i
brought
up
to
the
thrade
in
the
foundling
hospital
and
why
did
you
quit
it
because
it
a
low
mane
thrade
for
a
jintleman
but
john
who
told
you
that
you
were
a
gentleman
son
och
but
i
shure
of
it
thin
all
my
propensities
are
gintale
i
love
horses
and
dogs
and
fine
clothes
and
money
och
that
i
was
but
a
jintleman
i
show
them
what
life
is
intirely
and
i
challenge
masther
william
and
have
my
revenge
out
of
him
for
the
blows
he
gave
you
had
better
mend
your
trousers
said
i
giving
him
a
needle
a
pair
of
scissors
and
some
strong
thread
shure
an
i
do
that
same
in
a
brace
of
shakes
and
sitting
down
upon
a
ricketty
stool
of
his
own
manufacturing
he
commenced
his
tailoring
by
tearing
off
a
piece
of
his
trousers
to
patch
the
elbows
of
his
jacket
and
this
trifling
act
simple
as
it
may
appear
was
a
perfect
type
of
the
boy
general
conduct
and
marked
his
progress
through
life
the
present
for
him
was
everything
he
had
no
future
while
he
supplied
stuff
from
the
trousers
to
repair
the
fractures
in
the
jacket
he
never
reflected
that
both
would
be
required
on
the
morrow
poor
john
in
his
brief
and
reckless
career
how
often
have
i
recalled
that
foolish
act
of
his
it
now
appears
to
me
that
his
whole
life
was
spent
in
tearing
his
trousers
to
repair
his
jacket
in
the
evening
john
asked
me
for
a
piece
of
soap
what
do
you
want
with
soap
john
to
wash
my
shirt
shure
an
i
a
baste
to
be
seen
as
black
as
the
pots
sorra
a
shirt
have
i
but
the
one
an
it
has
stuck
on
my
back
so
long
that
i
can
thole
it
no
i
looked
at
the
wrists
and
collar
of
the
condemned
garment
which
was
all
of
it
that
john
allowed
to
be
visible
they
were
much
in
need
of
soap
and
water
well
john
i
will
leave
you
the
soap
but
can
you
wash
och
shure
an
i
can
thry
if
i
soap
it
enough
and
rub
long
enough
the
shirt
must
come
clane
at
i
thought
the
matter
rather
doubtful
but
when
i
went
to
bed
i
left
what
he
required
and
soon
saw
through
the
chinks
in
the
boards
a
roaring
fire
and
heard
john
whistling
over
the
tub
he
whistled
and
rubbed
and
washed
and
scrubbed
but
as
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
job
and
he
was
a
long
washing
this
one
garment
as
bell
would
have
been
performing
the
same
operation
on
fifty
i
laughed
to
myself
and
thought
of
my
own
abortive
attempts
in
that
way
and
went
fast
asleep
in
the
morning
john
came
to
his
breakfast
with
his
jacket
buttoned
up
to
his
throat
could
you
not
dry
your
shirt
by
the
fire
john
you
will
get
cold
wanting
aha
by
dad
it
dhry
enough
now
the
divil
has
made
tinder
of
it
long
afore
why
what
has
happened
to
it
i
heard
you
washing
all
washing
faith
an
i
did
scrub
it
till
my
hands
were
all
ruined
intirely
and
thin
i
took
the
brush
to
it
but
sorra
a
bit
of
the
dirth
could
i
get
out
of
it
the
more
i
rubbed
the
blacker
it
got
until
i
had
used
up
all
the
soap
and
the
perspiration
was
pouring
off
me
like
rain
dirthy
owld
bit
of
a
blackguard
of
a
rag
says
i
in
an
exthremity
of
rage
not
fit
for
the
back
of
a
dacent
lad
an
a
jintleman
the
divil
may
take
ye
to
cover
one
of
his
imps
an
wid
that
i
sthirred
up
the
fire
and
sent
it
plump
into
the
middle
of
the
and
what
will
you
do
for
a
shirt
faith
do
as
many
a
betther
man
has
done
afore
me
go
i
looked
up
two
old
shirts
of
my
husband
which
john
received
with
an
ecstacy
of
delight
he
retired
instantly
to
the
stable
but
soon
returned
with
as
much
of
the
linen
breast
of
the
garment
displayed
as
his
waistcoat
would
allow
no
peacock
was
ever
prouder
of
his
tail
than
the
wild
irish
lad
was
of
the
old
shirt
john
had
been
treated
very
much
like
a
spoiled
child
and
like
most
spoiled
children
he
was
rather
fond
of
having
his
own
way
moodie
had
set
him
to
do
something
which
was
rather
contrary
to
his
own
inclinations
he
did
not
object
to
the
task
in
words
for
he
was
rarely
saucy
to
his
employers
but
he
left
the
following
stave
upon
the
table
written
in
pencil
upon
a
scrap
of
paper
torn
from
the
back
of
an
old
letter
a
man
alive
an
ox
may
drive
unto
a
springing
well
to
make
him
drink
as
he
may
think
no
man
can
him
compel
john
the
emigrant
bride
a
canadian
ballad
the
waves
that
girt
my
native
isle
the
parting
sunbeams
tinged
with
red
and
far
to
seaward
many
a
mile
a
line
of
dazzling
glory
shed
but
ah
upon
that
glowing
track
no
glance
my
aching
eyeballs
threw
as
i
my
little
bark
steer
back
to
bid
my
love
a
last
adieu
upon
the
shores
of
that
lone
bay
with
folded
arms
the
maiden
stood
and
watch
the
white
sails
wing
their
way
across
the
gently
heaving
flood
the
summer
breeze
her
raven
hair
swept
lightly
from
her
snowy
brow
and
there
she
stood
as
pale
and
fair
as
the
white
foam
that
kiss
my
prow
my
throbbing
heart
with
grief
swell
high
a
heavy
tale
was
mine
to
tell
for
once
i
shunn
the
beauteous
eye
whose
glance
on
mine
so
fondly
fell
my
hopeless
message
soon
was
sped
my
father
voice
my
suit
denied
and
i
had
promised
not
to
wed
against
his
wish
my
island
bride
she
did
not
weep
though
her
pale
face
the
trace
of
recent
sorrow
wore
but
with
a
melancholy
grace
she
waved
my
shallop
from
the
shore
she
did
not
weep
but
oh
that
smile
was
sadder
than
the
briny
tear
that
trembled
on
my
cheek
the
while
i
bade
adieu
to
one
so
dear
she
did
not
speak
no
accents
fell
from
lips
that
breathed
the
balm
of
may
in
broken
words
i
strove
to
tell
all
that
my
broken
heart
would
say
she
did
not
speak
but
to
my
eyes
she
raised
the
deep
light
of
her
own
as
breaks
the
sun
through
cloudy
skies
my
spirit
caught
a
brighter
tone
dear
girl
i
cried
we
can
part
my
angry
father
wrath
i
brave
he
shall
not
tear
thee
from
my
heart
fly
fly
with
me
across
the
wave
my
hand
convulsively
she
press
her
tears
were
mingling
fast
with
mine
and
sinking
trembling
on
my
breast
she
murmur
out
for
ever
thine
chapter
ix
phoebe
r
and
our
second
moving
she
died
in
early
womanhood
sweet
scion
of
a
stem
so
rude
a
child
of
nature
free
from
art
with
candid
brow
and
open
heart
the
flowers
she
loved
now
gently
wave
above
her
low
and
nameless
it
was
during
the
month
of
march
that
uncle
joe
eldest
daughter
phoebe
a
very
handsome
girl
and
the
best
of
the
family
fell
sick
i
went
over
to
see
her
the
poor
girl
was
very
depressed
and
stood
but
a
slight
chance
for
her
life
being
under
medical
treatment
of
three
or
four
old
women
who
all
recommended
different
treatment
and
administered
different
nostrums
seeing
that
the
poor
girl
was
dangerously
ill
i
took
her
mother
aside
and
begged
her
to
lose
no
time
in
procuring
proper
medical
advice
joe
listened
to
me
very
sullenly
and
said
there
was
no
danger
that
phoebe
had
caught
a
violent
cold
by
going
hot
from
the
to
fetch
a
pail
of
water
from
the
spring
that
the
neighbours
knew
the
nature
of
her
complaint
and
would
soon
cure
her
the
invalid
turned
upon
me
her
fine
dark
eyes
in
which
the
light
of
fever
painfully
burned
and
motioned
me
to
come
near
her
i
sat
down
by
her
and
took
her
burning
hand
in
mine
i
am
dying
moodie
but
they
wo
believe
me
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
mother
to
send
for
the
i
will
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
anything
i
can
make
for
you
that
you
would
like
to
take
she
shook
her
head
i
ca
eat
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
thing
which
i
wish
very
much
to
she
grasped
my
hand
tightly
between
her
own
her
eyes
looked
darker
and
her
feverish
cheek
paled
what
becomes
of
people
when
they
die
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
can
you
be
ignorant
of
a
future
state
what
is
a
future
state
i
endeavoured
as
well
as
i
was
able
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
the
soul
its
endless
duration
and
responsibility
to
god
for
the
actions
done
in
the
flesh
its
natural
depravity
and
need
of
a
saviour
urging
her
in
the
gentlest
manner
to
lose
no
time
in
obtaining
forgiveness
of
her
sins
through
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
the
poor
girl
looked
at
me
with
surprise
and
horror
these
things
were
all
new
to
her
she
sat
like
one
in
a
dream
yet
the
truth
seemed
to
flash
upon
her
at
once
how
can
i
speak
to
god
who
never
knew
him
how
can
i
ask
him
to
forgive
me
you
must
pray
to
pray
i
do
know
how
to
pray
i
never
said
a
prayer
in
my
life
mother
can
you
teach
me
how
to
pray
nonsense
said
joe
hurrying
forward
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
about
such
things
moodie
i
desire
you
not
to
put
such
thoughts
into
my
daughter
head
we
do
want
to
know
anything
about
jesus
christ
oh
mother
do
speak
so
to
the
lady
do
moodie
tell
me
more
about
god
and
my
soul
i
never
knew
until
now
that
i
had
a
deeply
compassionating
the
ignorance
of
the
poor
girl
in
spite
of
the
menaces
of
the
heathen
mother
for
she
was
no
better
but
rather
worse
seeing
that
the
heathen
worships
in
ignorance
a
false
god
while
this
woman
lived
without
acknowledging
a
god
at
all
and
therefore
considered
herself
free
from
all
moral
restraint
i
bid
phoebe
and
promised
to
bring
my
bible
and
read
to
her
the
next
day
the
gratitude
manifested
by
this
sick
girl
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
rudeness
and
brutality
of
the
rest
of
the
family
that
i
soon
felt
a
powerful
interest
in
her
fate
the
mother
did
not
actually
forbid
me
the
house
because
she
saw
that
my
visits
raised
the
drooping
spirits
of
her
child
whom
she
fiercely
loved
and
to
save
her
life
would
cheerfully
have
sacrificed
her
own
but
she
never
failed
to
make
all
the
noise
she
could
to
disturb
my
reading
and
conversation
with
phoebe
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
her
daughter
was
really
in
any
danger
until
the
doctor
told
her
that
her
case
was
hopeless
then
the
grief
of
the
mother
burst
forth
and
she
gave
way
to
the
most
frantic
and
impious
complainings
the
rigour
of
the
winter
began
to
abate
the
beams
of
the
sun
during
the
day
were
warm
and
penetrating
and
a
soft
wind
blew
from
the
south
i
watched
from
day
to
day
the
snow
disappearing
from
the
earth
with
indescribable
pleasure
and
at
length
it
wholly
vanished
not
even
a
solitary
patch
lingered
under
the
shade
of
the
forest
trees
but
uncle
joe
gave
no
sign
of
removing
his
family
does
he
mean
to
stay
all
the
summer
thought
i
perhaps
he
never
intends
going
at
all
i
will
ask
him
the
next
time
he
comes
to
borrow
in
the
afternoon
he
walked
in
to
light
his
pipe
and
with
some
anxiety
i
made
the
inquiry
well
i
guess
we
ca
be
moving
afore
the
end
of
may
my
missus
expects
to
be
confined
the
fore
part
of
the
month
and
i
sha
move
till
she
be
quite
smart
you
are
not
using
us
well
in
keeping
us
out
of
the
house
so
oh
i
do
care
a
curse
about
any
of
you
it
is
my
house
as
long
as
i
choose
to
remain
in
it
and
you
may
put
up
with
it
the
best
way
you
can
and
humming
a
yankee
tune
he
departed
i
had
borne
patiently
the
odious
place
during
the
winter
but
now
the
hot
weather
was
coming
it
seemed
almost
insupportable
as
we
were
obliged
to
have
a
fire
in
the
close
room
in
order
to
cook
our
provisions
i
consoled
myself
as
well
as
i
could
by
roaming
about
the
fields
and
woods
and
making
acquaintance
with
every
wild
flower
as
it
blossomed
and
in
writing
long
letters
to
home
friends
in
which
i
abused
one
of
the
finest
countries
in
the
world
as
the
worst
that
god
ever
called
out
of
chaos
i
can
recall
to
memory
at
this
moment
the
few
lines
of
a
poem
which
commenced
in
this
strain
nor
am
i
sorry
that
the
rest
of
it
has
passed
into
oblivion
oh
land
of
waters
how
my
spirit
tires
in
the
dark
prison
of
thy
boundless
woods
no
rural
charm
poetic
thought
inspires
no
music
murmurs
in
thy
mighty
floods
though
vast
the
features
that
compose
thy
frame
turn
where
we
will
the
landscape
still
the
same
the
swampy
margin
of
thy
inland
seas
the
eternal
forest
girdling
either
shore
its
belt
of
dark
pines
sighing
in
the
breeze
and
rugged
fields
with
rude
huts
dotted
show
cultivation
unimproved
by
art
that
sheds
a
barren
chillness
on
the
heart
how
many
emigrants
during
their
first
winter
in
canada
will
respond
to
this
gloomy
picture
let
them
wait
a
few
years
the
sun
of
hope
will
arise
and
beautify
the
landscape
and
they
will
proclaim
the
country
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
the
middle
of
may
at
length
arrived
and
by
the
number
of
long
lean
women
with
handkerchiefs
of
all
colours
tied
over
their
heads
who
passed
my
door
and
swarmed
into
joe
house
i
rightly
concluded
that
another
young
one
had
been
added
to
the
tribe
and
shortly
after
uncle
joe
himself
announced
the
important
fact
by
putting
his
jolly
red
face
in
at
the
door
and
telling
me
that
his
missus
had
got
a
chopping
boy
and
he
was
right
glad
of
it
for
he
was
tired
of
so
many
gals
and
that
he
should
move
in
a
fortnight
if
his
woman
did
i
had
been
so
often
disappointed
that
i
paid
very
little
heed
to
him
but
this
time
he
kept
his
word
the
day
of
may
they
went
bag
and
baggage
the
poor
sick
phoebe
who
still
lingered
on
and
the
infant
and
right
joyfully
i
sent
a
scotch
girl
another
bell
whom
i
had
hired
in
lieu
of
her
i
had
lost
and
monaghan
to
clean
out
the
augean
stable
in
a
few
minutes
john
returned
panting
his
indignation
the
house
he
said
was
more
filthy
than
a
but
that
was
not
the
worst
of
it
uncle
joe
before
he
went
had
undermined
the
brick
chimney
and
let
all
the
water
into
the
house
oh
but
if
he
comes
here
agin
he
continued
grinding
his
teeth
and
doubling
his
fist
i
thrash
him
for
it
and
thin
he
has
girdled
round
all
the
best
graft
the
murtherin
owld
villain
as
if
it
could
spile
his
digestion
our
ating
it
would
require
a
strong
stomach
to
digest
john
but
never
mind
it
ca
be
helped
and
we
may
be
very
thankful
that
these
people
are
gone
at
john
and
bell
scrubbed
at
the
house
all
day
and
in
the
evening
they
carried
over
the
furniture
and
i
went
to
inspect
our
new
dwelling
it
looked
beautifully
clean
and
neat
bell
had
whitewashed
all
the
black
smoky
walls
and
boarded
ceilings
and
scrubbed
the
dirty
and
polished
the
panes
of
glass
until
they
actually
admitted
a
glimpse
of
the
clear
air
and
the
blue
sky
fringed
curtains
and
a
bed
with
furniture
to
correspond
a
carpeted
floor
and
a
large
pot
of
green
boughs
on
the
hearthstone
gave
an
air
of
comfort
and
cleanliness
to
a
room
which
only
a
few
hours
before
had
been
a
loathsome
den
of
filth
and
impurity
this
change
would
have
been
very
gratifying
had
not
a
strong
disagreeable
odour
almost
deprived
me
of
my
breath
as
i
entered
the
room
it
was
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
smelt
before
and
turned
me
so
sick
and
faint
that
i
had
to
cling
to
the
for
support
where
does
this
dreadful
smell
come
from
the
guidness
knows
john
and
i
have
searched
the
house
from
the
loft
to
the
cellar
but
we
canna
find
out
the
cause
of
thae
it
must
be
in
the
room
bell
and
it
is
impossible
to
remain
here
or
live
in
this
house
until
it
is
glancing
my
eyes
all
round
the
place
i
spied
what
seemed
to
me
a
little
cupboard
over
the
and
i
told
john
to
see
if
i
was
right
the
lad
mounted
upon
a
chair
and
pulled
open
a
small
door
but
almost
fell
to
the
ground
with
the
dreadful
stench
which
seemed
to
rush
from
the
closet
what
is
it
john
i
cried
from
the
open
door
a
skunk
a
skunk
shure
i
thought
the
divil
had
scorched
his
tail
and
left
the
grizzled
hair
behind
him
what
a
strong
perfume
it
has
he
continued
holding
up
the
beautiful
but
odious
little
creature
by
the
tail
by
dad
i
know
all
about
it
now
i
saw
ned
layton
only
two
days
ago
crossing
the
field
with
uncle
joe
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
this
wee
bit
baste
in
his
hand
they
were
both
laughing
like
sixty
if
this
does
not
stink
the
scotchman
out
of
the
house
said
joe
be
contint
to
be
tarred
and
feathered
and
thin
they
both
laughed
until
they
stopped
to
draw
i
could
hardly
help
laughing
myself
but
i
begged
monaghan
to
convey
the
horrid
creature
away
and
putting
some
salt
and
sulphur
into
a
tin
plate
and
setting
fire
to
it
i
placed
it
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
closed
all
the
doors
for
an
hour
which
greatly
assisted
in
purifying
the
house
from
the
skunkification
bell
then
washed
out
the
closet
with
strong
ley
and
in
a
short
time
no
vestige
remained
of
the
malicious
trick
that
uncle
joe
had
played
off
upon
us
the
next
day
we
took
possession
of
our
new
mansion
and
no
one
was
better
pleased
with
the
change
than
little
katie
she
was
now
fifteen
months
old
and
could
just
begin
to
prattle
but
she
dared
not
venture
to
step
alone
although
she
would
stand
by
a
chair
all
day
and
even
climb
upon
it
she
crept
from
room
to
room
feeling
and
admiring
everything
and
talking
to
it
in
her
baby
language
so
fond
was
the
dear
child
of
flowers
that
her
father
used
to
hold
her
up
to
the
then
rich
in
their
full
spring
beauty
that
she
might
kiss
the
blossoms
she
would
pat
them
with
her
soft
white
hands
murmuring
like
a
bee
among
the
branches
to
keep
her
quiet
whilst
i
was
busy
i
had
only
to
give
her
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
she
would
sit
as
still
as
a
lamb
looking
first
at
one
and
then
another
pressing
them
to
her
little
breast
in
a
sort
of
ecstacy
as
if
she
comprehended
the
worth
of
this
most
beautiful
of
god
gifts
to
man
she
was
a
sweet
lovely
flower
herself
and
her
charming
infant
graces
reconciled
me
more
than
aught
else
to
a
weary
lot
was
she
not
purely
british
did
not
her
soft
blue
eyes
and
sunny
curls
and
bright
rosy
cheeks
for
ever
remind
me
of
her
saxon
origin
and
bring
before
me
dear
forms
and
faces
i
could
never
hope
to
behold
again
the
first
night
we
slept
in
the
new
house
a
demon
of
unrest
had
taken
possession
of
it
in
the
shape
of
a
countless
swarm
of
mice
they
scampered
over
our
pillows
and
jumped
upon
our
faces
squeaking
and
cutting
a
thousand
capers
over
the
floor
i
never
could
realise
the
true
value
of
whittington
invaluable
cat
until
that
night
at
first
we
laughed
until
our
sides
ached
but
in
reality
it
was
no
laughing
matter
moodie
remembered
that
we
had
left
a
in
the
old
house
he
went
and
brought
it
over
baited
it
and
set
it
on
the
table
near
the
bed
during
the
night
no
less
than
fourteen
of
the
provoking
vermin
were
captured
and
for
several
succeeding
nights
the
trap
did
equal
execution
how
uncle
joe
family
could
have
allowed
such
a
nuisance
to
exist
astonished
me
to
sleep
with
these
creatures
continually
running
over
us
was
impossible
and
they
were
not
the
only
evils
in
the
shape
of
vermin
we
had
to
contend
with
the
old
logs
which
composed
the
walls
of
the
house
were
full
of
bugs
and
large
black
ants
and
the
place
owing
to
the
number
of
dogs
that
always
had
slept
under
the
beds
with
the
children
was
infested
with
fleas
it
required
the
utmost
care
to
rid
the
place
of
these
noisome
and
disgusting
tenants
arriving
in
the
country
in
the
autumn
we
had
never
experienced
any
inconvenience
from
the
mosquitoes
but
after
the
first
moist
warm
spring
days
particularly
after
the
showers
these
tormenting
insects
annoyed
us
greatly
the
farm
lying
in
a
valley
cut
up
with
little
streams
in
every
direction
made
us
more
liable
to
their
inflictions
the
hands
arms
and
face
of
the
poor
babe
were
covered
every
morning
with
red
inflamed
bumps
which
often
threw
out
blisters
the
banks
of
the
little
streams
abounded
with
wild
strawberries
which
although
small
were
of
a
delicious
flavour
thither
bell
and
i
and
the
baby
daily
repaired
to
gather
the
bright
red
berries
of
nature
own
providing
katie
young
as
she
was
was
very
expert
at
helping
herself
and
we
used
to
seat
her
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
bed
whilst
we
gathered
farther
on
hearing
her
talking
very
lovingly
to
something
in
the
grass
which
she
tried
to
clutch
between
her
white
hands
calling
it
pitty
pitty
i
ran
to
the
spot
and
found
that
it
was
a
large
that
she
was
so
affectionately
courting
to
her
embrace
not
then
aware
that
this
reptile
was
perfectly
harmless
i
snatched
the
child
up
in
my
arms
and
ran
with
her
home
never
stopping
until
i
gained
the
house
and
saw
her
safely
seated
in
her
cradle
it
had
been
a
very
late
cold
spring
but
the
trees
had
fully
expanded
into
leaf
and
the
forest
world
was
glorious
in
its
beauty
every
patch
of
cleared
land
presented
a
vivid
green
to
the
eye
the
brook
brawled
in
the
gay
sunshine
and
the
warm
air
was
filled
with
soft
murmurs
gorgeous
butterflies
floated
about
like
winged
flowers
and
feelings
allied
to
poetry
and
gladness
once
more
pervaded
my
heart
in
the
evening
we
wandered
through
the
woodland
paths
beneath
the
glowing
canadian
sunset
and
gathered
rare
specimens
of
strange
plants
and
flowers
every
object
that
met
my
eyes
was
new
to
me
and
produced
that
peculiar
excitement
which
has
its
origin
in
a
thirst
for
knowledge
and
a
love
of
variety
we
had
commenced
gardening
too
and
my
vegetables
did
great
credit
to
my
skill
and
care
and
when
once
the
warm
weather
sets
in
the
rapid
advance
of
vegetation
in
canada
is
astonishing
not
understanding
much
about
farming
especially
in
a
climate
like
canada
moodie
was
advised
by
a
neighbouring
settler
to
farm
his
farm
upon
shares
this
advice
seemed
very
reasonable
and
had
it
been
given
disinterestedly
and
had
the
persons
recommended
a
man
and
his
wife
been
worthy
or
honest
people
we
might
have
done
very
well
but
the
farmer
had
found
out
their
encroaching
ways
was
anxious
to
get
rid
of
them
himself
and
saw
no
better
way
of
doing
so
than
by
palming
them
upon
us
from
our
engagement
with
these
people
commenced
that
long
series
of
losses
and
troubles
to
which
their
conduct
formed
the
prelude
they
were
to
live
in
the
little
shanty
that
we
had
just
left
and
work
the
farm
moodie
was
to
find
them
the
land
the
use
of
his
implements
and
cattle
and
all
the
seed
for
the
crops
and
to
share
with
them
the
returns
besides
this
they
unfortunately
were
allowed
to
keep
their
own
cows
pigs
and
poultry
the
produce
of
the
orchard
with
which
they
had
nothing
to
do
was
reserved
for
our
own
use
for
the
first
few
weeks
they
were
civil
and
obliging
enough
and
had
the
man
been
left
to
himself
i
believe
we
should
have
done
pretty
well
but
the
wife
was
a
bold
woman
who
instigated
him
to
every
mischief
they
took
advantage
of
us
in
every
way
they
could
and
were
constantly
committing
petty
depredations
from
our
own
experience
of
this
mode
of
farming
i
would
strenuously
advise
all
new
settlers
never
to
embrace
any
such
offer
without
they
are
well
acquainted
with
the
parties
and
can
thoroughly
rely
upon
their
honesty
or
else
like
o
they
may
impudently
tell
you
that
they
can
cheat
you
as
they
please
and
defy
you
to
help
yourself
all
the
money
we
expended
upon
the
farm
was
entirely
for
these
people
benefit
for
by
their
joint
contrivances
very
little
of
the
crops
fell
to
our
share
and
when
any
division
was
made
it
was
always
when
moodie
was
absent
from
home
and
there
was
no
person
present
to
see
fair
play
they
sold
what
apples
and
potatoes
they
pleased
and
fed
their
hogs
ad
libitum
but
even
their
roguery
was
more
tolerable
than
the
irksome
restraint
which
their
near
vicinity
and
constantly
having
to
come
in
contact
with
them
imposed
we
had
no
longer
any
privacy
our
servants
were
and
our
family
affairs
canvassed
by
these
gossiping
people
who
spread
about
a
thousand
falsehoods
regarding
us
i
was
so
much
disgusted
with
this
shareship
that
i
would
gladly
have
given
them
all
the
proceeds
of
the
farm
to
get
rid
of
them
but
the
bargain
was
for
twelve
months
and
bad
as
it
was
we
could
not
break
our
engagement
one
little
trick
of
this
woman
will
serve
to
illustrate
her
general
conduct
a
neighbouring
farmer
wife
had
presented
me
with
some
very
pretty
hens
who
followed
to
the
call
of
old
betty
handsome
i
was
always
fond
of
fowls
and
the
innocent
katie
delighted
in
her
chicks
and
would
call
them
round
her
to
the
sill
of
the
door
to
feed
from
her
hand
o
had
the
same
number
as
i
had
and
i
often
admired
them
when
marshalled
forth
by
her
splendid
black
rooster
one
morning
i
saw
her
eldest
son
chop
off
the
head
of
the
fine
bird
and
i
asked
his
mother
why
she
had
allowed
him
to
kill
the
beautiful
creature
she
laughed
and
merely
replied
that
she
wanted
it
for
the
pot
the
next
day
my
sultan
walked
over
to
the
widowed
hens
and
took
all
his
seraglio
with
him
from
that
hour
i
never
gathered
a
single
egg
the
hens
deposited
all
their
eggs
in
o
she
used
to
boast
of
this
as
an
excellent
joke
among
her
neighbours
on
the
of
june
my
dear
little
agnes
was
born
a
few
days
after
this
joyful
event
i
heard
a
great
bustle
in
the
room
adjoining
to
mine
and
old
dolly
rowe
my
cornish
nurse
informed
me
that
it
was
occasioned
by
the
people
who
came
to
attend
the
funeral
of
phoebe
r
she
only
survived
the
removal
of
the
family
a
week
and
at
her
own
request
had
been
brought
all
the
way
from
the
lake
plains
to
be
interred
in
the
burying
ground
on
the
hill
which
overlooked
the
stream
as
i
lay
upon
my
pillow
i
could
distinctly
see
the
spot
and
mark
the
long
funeral
procession
as
it
wound
along
the
banks
of
the
brook
it
was
a
solemn
and
imposing
spectacle
that
humble
funeral
when
the
waggons
reached
the
rude
enclosure
the
coffin
was
carefully
lifted
to
the
ground
the
door
in
the
lid
opened
and
old
and
young
approached
one
after
another
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
dead
before
consigning
her
to
the
oblivion
of
the
grave
poor
phoebe
gentle
child
of
coarse
unfeeling
parents
few
shed
more
sincerely
a
tear
for
thy
early
fate
than
the
stranger
whom
they
hated
and
despised
often
have
i
stood
beside
that
humble
mound
when
the
song
of
the
lark
was
above
me
and
the
bee
murmuring
at
my
feet
and
thought
that
it
was
well
for
thee
that
god
opened
the
eyes
of
thy
soul
and
called
thee
out
of
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
sin
to
glory
in
his
marvellous
light
sixteen
years
have
passed
away
since
i
heard
anything
of
the
family
or
what
had
become
of
them
when
i
was
told
by
a
neighbour
of
theirs
whom
i
accidentally
met
last
winter
that
the
old
woman
who
now
nearly
numbers
a
hundred
years
is
still
living
and
inhabits
a
corner
of
her
son
barn
as
she
still
quarrels
too
much
with
his
wife
to
reside
with
joe
that
the
girls
are
all
married
and
gone
and
that
joe
himself
although
he
does
not
know
a
letter
has
commenced
travelling
preacher
after
this
who
can
doubt
the
existence
of
miracles
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
faithful
heart
that
loves
thee
still
i
kneel
beside
the
cold
grey
stone
that
tells
me
dearest
thou
art
gone
to
realms
more
bless
and
left
me
still
to
struggle
with
this
world
of
ill
but
oft
from
out
the
silent
mound
delusive
fancy
breathes
a
sound
my
heart
within
me
burns
and
all
the
blessed
past
returns
thy
form
is
present
to
mine
eye
thy
voice
is
whispering
in
mine
ear
the
love
that
spake
in
days
gone
by
and
rapture
checks
the
starting
tear
thy
deathless
spirit
wakes
to
fill
the
faithful
heart
that
loves
thee
still
for
thee
the
day
bright
glow
is
and
summer
roses
bloom
no
more
the
song
of
birds
in
twilight
bowers
the
breath
of
spring
delicious
flowers
the
towering
wood
and
mountain
height
the
glorious
pageantry
of
night
which
fill
thy
soul
with
musings
high
and
lighted
up
thy
speaking
eye
the
mournful
music
of
the
wave
can
never
reach
thy
lonely
grave
thou
dost
but
sleep
it
can
not
be
that
ardent
heart
is
silent
now
that
death
dark
door
has
closed
on
thee
and
made
thee
cold
to
all
below
ah
no
the
flame
death
could
not
chill
thy
tender
love
survives
thee
still

thou
lovest
so
well

its

thy

and

love
sacred
tribute
the
dead
to
dream
again
of
days
gone
by
and

x
brian
the
memory
glass
i
see
his
shadow
flit
though
he
was
gathered
to
the
silent
dust
long
years
ago
a
strange
and
wayward
man
that
shunn
companionship
and
lived
apart
the
leafy
covert
of
the
dark
brown
woods
the
gleamy
lakes
hid
in
their
gloomy
depths
whose
still
deep
waters
never
knew
the
stroke
of
cleaving
oar
or
echoed
to
the
sound
of
social
life
contained
for
him
the
sum
of
human
happiness
with
dog
and
gun
day
after
day
he
track
the
nimble
deer
through
all
the
tangled
mazes
of
the
it
was
early
day
i
was
alone
in
the
old
shanty
preparing
breakfast
and
now
and
then
stirring
the
cradle
with
my
foot
when
a
tall
thin
man
walked
into
the
house
followed
by
two
large
strong
dogs
placing
the
rifle
he
had
carried
on
his
shoulder
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
advanced
to
the
hearth
and
without
speaking
or
seemingly
looking
at
me
lighted
his
pipe
and
commenced
smoking
the
dogs
after
growling
and
snapping
at
the
cat
who
had
not
given
the
strangers
a
very
courteous
reception
sat
down
on
the
on
either
side
of
their
taciturn
master
eyeing
him
from
time
to
time
as
if
long
habit
had
made
them
understand
all
his
motions
there
was
a
great
contrast
between
the
dogs
the
one
was
a
brindled
bulldog
of
the
largest
size
a
most
formidable
and
powerful
brute
the
other
a
staghound
tawny
and
i
regarded
the
man
and
his
hairy
companions
with
silent
curiosity
he
was
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
his
head
nearly
bald
was
studded
at
the
sides
with
strong
coarse
black
curling
hair
his
features
were
high
his
complexion
brightly
dark
and
his
eyes
in
size
shape
and
colour
greatly
resembled
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
the
face
itself
was
sorrowful
and
taciturn
and
his
thin
compressed
lips
looked
as
if
they
were
not
much
accustomed
to
smile
or
often
to
unclose
to
hold
social
communion
with
any
one
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
huge
hearth
silently
smoking
his
eyes
bent
on
the
fire
and
now
and
then
he
patted
the
heads
of
his
dogs
reproving
their
exuberant
expression
of
attachment
with
down
music
down
chance
a
cold
clear
morning
said
i
in
order
to
attract
his
attention
and
draw
him
into
conversation
a
nod
without
raising
his
head
or
withdrawing
his
eyes
from
the
fire
was
his
only
answer
and
turning
from
my
unsociable
guest
i
took
up
the
baby
who
just
then
awoke
sat
down
on
a
low
stool
by
the
table
and
began
feeding
her
during
this
operation
i
once
or
twice
caught
the
stranger
fixed
upon
me
and
the
child
but
word
spoke
he
none
and
presently
after
whistling
to
his
dogs
he
resumed
his
gun
and
strode
out
when
moodie
and
monaghan
came
in
to
breakfast
i
told
them
what
a
strange
visitor
i
had
had
and
moodie
laughed
at
my
vain
attempt
to
induce
him
to
talk
he
is
a
strange
being
i
said
i
must
find
out
who
and
what
he
in
the
afternoon
an
old
soldier
called
layton
who
had
served
during
the
american
war
and
got
a
grant
of
land
about
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
our
location
came
in
to
trade
for
a
cow
now
this
layton
was
a
perfect
ruffian
a
man
whom
no
one
liked
and
whom
all
feared
he
was
a
deep
drinker
a
great
swearer
in
short
a
perfect
reprobate
who
never
cultivated
his
land
but
went
jobbing
about
from
farm
to
farm
trading
horses
and
cattle
and
cheating
in
a
pettifogging
way
uncle
joe
had
employed
him
to
sell
moodie
a
young
heifer
and
he
had
brought
her
over
for
him
to
look
at
when
he
came
in
to
be
paid
i
described
the
stranger
of
the
morning
and
as
i
knew
that
he
was
familiar
with
every
one
in
the
neighbourhood
i
asked
if
he
knew
him
no
one
should
know
him
better
than
myself
he
said
is
old
brian
b
the
and
a
near
neighbour
of
a
sour
morose
queer
chap
he
is
and
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
from
lancashire
in
england
and
came
to
this
country
some
twenty
years
ago
with
his
wife
who
was
a
pretty
young
lass
in
those
days
and
slim
enough
then
though
she
so
awful
fleshy
now
he
had
lots
of
money
too
and
he
bought
four
hundred
acres
of
land
just
at
the
corner
of
the
concession
line
where
it
meets
the
main
road
and
excellent
land
it
is
and
a
better
farmer
while
he
stuck
to
his
business
never
went
into
the
bush
for
it
was
all
bush
here
then
he
was
a
dashing
handsome
fellow
too
and
did
not
hoard
the
money
either
he
loved
his
pipe
and
his
pot
too
well
and
at
last
he
left
off
farming
and
gave
himself
to
them
altogether
many
a
jolly
booze
he
and
i
have
had
i
can
tell
you
brian
was
an
awful
passionate
man
and
when
the
liquor
was
in
and
the
wit
was
out
as
savage
and
as
quarrelsome
as
a
bear
at
such
times
there
was
no
one
but
ned
layton
dared
go
near
him
we
once
had
a
pitched
battle
in
which
i
was
conqueror
and
ever
arter
he
yielded
a
sort
of
sulky
obedience
to
all
i
said
to
him
arter
being
on
the
spree
for
a
week
or
two
he
would
take
fits
of
remorse
and
return
home
to
his
wife
would
fall
down
at
her
knees
and
ask
her
forgiveness
and
cry
like
a
child
at
other
times
he
would
hide
himself
up
in
the
woods
and
steal
home
at
night
and
get
what
he
wanted
out
of
the
pantry
without
speaking
a
word
to
any
one
he
went
on
with
these
pranks
for
some
years
till
he
took
a
fit
of
the
blue
devils
away
ned
to
the
lake
with
me
said
he
am
weary
of
my
life
and
i
want
a
change

take
the

i
black

prime
season
and
f

old
canoe

capital
rum
up
from
kingston

day
and
have
a
spree
at
night

fish
nor
to
shoot
ned
it
a
new
game
i
going
to
try
so
come
along
well
to
the
lake
we
went
the
day
was
very
hot
and
our
path
lay
through
the
woods
and
over
those
scorching
plains
for
eight
long
miles
i
thought
i
should
have
dropped
by
the
way
but
during
our
long
walk
my
companion
never
opened
his
lips
he
strode
on
before
me
at
a
never
once
turning
his
head
man
must
be
the
devil
says
i
accustomed
to
a
warmer
place
or
he
must
feel
this
hollo
brian
stop
there
do
you
mean
to
kill
me
it
easy
says
he
see
another
day
arter
this
business
on
hand
and
can
not
wait
well
on
we
went
at
the
same
awful
rate
and
it
was
when
we
got
to
the
little
tavern
on
the
lake
shore
kept
by
one
f
who
had
a
boat
for
the
convenience
of
strangers
who
came
to
visit
the
place
here
we
got
our
dinner
and
a
glass
of
rum
to
wash
it
down
but
brian
was
moody
and
to
all
my
jokes
he
only
returned
a
sort
of
grunt
and
while
i
was
talking
with
f
he
steps
out
and
a
few
minutes
arter
we
saw
him
crossing
the
lake
in
the
old
canoe
the
matter
with
brian
says
f
does
not
seem
right
with
him
ned
you
had
better
take
the
boat
and
look
arter
him
says
i
often
so
and
grows
so
glum
nowadays
that
i
will
cut
his
acquaintance
altogether
if
he
does
not
improve
drinks
awful
hard
says
f
be
he
got
a
fit
of
the
there
is
no
telling
what
he
may
be
up
to
at
this
minute
my
mind
misgave
me
too
so
i
takes
the
oars
and
pushes
out
right
upon
brian
track
and
by
the
lord
harry
if
i
did
not
find
him
upon
my
landing
on
the
opposite
shore
lying
wallowing
in
his
blood
with
his
throat
cut
that
you
brian
says
i
giving
him
a
kick
with
my
foot
to
see
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
on
earth
tempted
you
to
play
me
and
f
such
a
dirty
mean
trick
as
to
go
and
stick
yourself
like
a
pig
bringing
such
a
discredit
upon
the
house
and
you
so
far
from
home
and
those
who
should
nurse
you
i
was
so
mad
with
him
that
saving
your
presence
i
swore
awfully
and
called
him
names
that
would
be
ondacent
to
repeat
here
but
he
only
answered
with
groans
and
a
horrid
gurgling
in
his
throat
a
choking
you
are
said
i
you
sha
have
your
own
way
and
die
so
easily
either
if
i
can
punish
you
by
keeping
you
alive
so
i
just
turned
him
upon
his
stomach
with
his
head
down
the
steep
bank
but
he
still
kept
choking
and
growing
black
in
the
layton
then
detailed
some
particulars
of
his
surgical
practice
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
he
continued
i
bound
up
his
throat
with
my
handkerchief
and
took
him
neck
and
heels
and
threw
him
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
presently
he
came
to
himself
a
little
and
sat
up
in
the
boat
and
would
you
believe
it
made
several
attempts
to
throw
himself
in
the
water
will
not
do
says
i
done
mischief
enough
already
by
cutting
your
weasand
if
you
dare
to
try
that
again
i
will
kill
you
with
the
oar
i
held
it
up
to
threaten
him
he
was
scared
and
lay
down
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
i
put
my
foot
upon
his
breast
still
now
or
you
catch
it
he
looked
piteously
at
me
he
could
not
speak
but
his
eyes
seemed
to
say
pity
upon
me
ned
do
kill
me
yes
this
man
who
had
just
cut
his
throat
and
twice
arter
that
tried
to
drown
himself
was
afraid
that
i
should
knock
him
on
the
head
and
kill
him
ha
ha
i
shall
never
forget
the
work
that
f
and
i
had
with
him
arter
i
got
him
up
to
the
house
the
doctor
came
and
sewed
up
his
throat
and
his
wife
poor
crittur
came
to
nurse
him
bad
as
he
was
she
was
mortal
fond
of
him
he
lay
there
sick
and
unable
to
leave
his
bed
for
three
months
and
did
nothing
but
pray
to
god
to
forgive
him
for
he
thought
the
devil
would
surely
have
him
for
cutting
his
own
throat
and
when
he
got
about
again
which
is
now
twelve
years
ago
he
left
off
drinking
entirely
and
wanders
about
the
woods
with
his
dogs
hunting
he
seldom
speaks
to
any
one
and
his
wife
brother
carries
on
the
farm
for
the
family
he
is
so
shy
of
strangers
that
is
a
wonder
he
came
in
here
the
old
wives
are
afraid
of
him
but
you
need
not
heed
him
his
troubles
are
to
himself
he
harms
no
layton
departed
and
left
me
brooding
over
the
sad
tale
which
he
had
told
in
such
an
absurd
and
jesting
manner
it
was
evident
from
the
account
he
had
given
of
brian
attempt
at
suicide
that
the
hapless
hunter
was
not
wholly
answerable
for
his
conduct
that
he
was
a
harmless
maniac
the
next
morning
at
the
very
same
hour
brian
again
made
his
appearance
but
instead
of
the
rifle
across
his
shoulder
a
large
stone
jar
occupied
the
place
suspended
by
a
stout
leather
thong
without
saying
a
word
but
with
a
truly
benevolent
smile
that
flitted
slowly
over
his
stern
features
and
lighted
them
up
like
a
sunbeam
breaking
from
beneath
a
stormy
cloud
he
advanced
to
the
table
and
unslinging
the
jar
set
it
down
before
me
and
in
a
low
and
gruff
but
by
no
means
an
unfriendly
voice
said
milk
for
the
child
and
vanished
how
good
it
was
of
him
how
kind
i
exclaimed
as
i
poured
the
precious
gift
of
four
quarts
of
pure
new
milk
out
into
a
deep
pan
i
had
not
asked
him
had
never
said
that
the
poor
weanling
wanted
milk
it
was
the
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
of
a
man
of
benevolence
and
refinement
for
weeks
did
my
strange
silent
friend
steal
in
take
up
the
empty
jar
and
supply
its
place
with
another
replenished
with
milk
the
baby
knew
his
step
and
would
hold
out
her
hands
to
him
and
cry
milk
and
brian
would
stoop
down
and
kiss
her
and
his
two
great
dogs
lick
her
face
have
you
any
children
b
yes
five
but
none
like
my
little
girl
is
greatly
indebted
to
you
for
your
she
welcome
or
she
would
not
get
it
you
are
strangers
but
i
like
you
all
you
look
kind
and
i
would
like
to
know
more
about
moodie
shook
hands
with
the
old
hunter
and
assured
him
that
we
should
always
be
glad
to
see
him
after
this
invitation
brian
became
a
frequent
guest
he
would
sit
and
listen
with
delight
to
moodie
while
he
described
to
him
at
the
cape
grasping
his
rifle
in
a
determined
manner
and
whistling
an
encouraging
air
to
his
dogs
i
asked
him
one
evening
what
made
him
so
fond
of
hunting
is
the
excitement
he
said
it
drowns
thought
and
i
love
to
be
alone
i
am
sorry
for
the
creatures
too
for
they
are
free
and
happy
yet
i
am
led
by
an
instinct
i
can
not
restrain
to
kill
them
sometimes
the
sight
of
their
dying
agonies
recalls
painful
feelings
and
then
i
lay
aside
the
gun
and
do
not
hunt
for
days
but
is
fine
to
be
alone
with
god
in
the
great
woods
to
watch
the
sunbeams
stealing
through
the
thick
branches
the
blue
sky
breaking
in
upon
you
in
patches
and
to
know
that
all
is
bright
and
shiny
above
you
in
spite
of
the
gloom
that
surrounds
after
a
long
pause
he
continued
with
much
solemn
feeling
in
his
look
and
tone
i
lived
a
life
of
folly
for
years
for
i
was
respectably
born
and
educated
and
had
seen
something
of
the
world
perhaps
more
than
was
good
before
i
left
home
for
the
woods
and
from
the
teaching
i
had
received
from
kind
relatives
and
parents
i
should
have
known
how
to
have
conducted
myself
better
but
madam
if
we
associate
long
with
the
depraved
and
ignorant
we
learn
to
become
even
worse
than
they
are
i
felt
deeply
my
degradation
felt
that
i
had
become
the
slave
to
low
vice
and
in
order
to
emancipate
myself
from
the
hateful
tyranny
of
evil
passions
i
did
a
very
rash
and
foolish
thing
i
need
not
mention
the
manner
in
which
i
transgressed
god
holy
laws
all
the
neighbours
know
it
and
must
have
told
you
long
ago
i
could
have
borne
reproof
but
they
turned
my
sorrow
into
indecent
jests
and
unable
to
bear
their
coarse
ridicule
i
made
companions
of
my
dogs
and
gun
and
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
hunting
became
a
habit
i
could
no
longer
live
without
it
and
it
supplies
the
stimulant
which
i
lost
when
i
renounced
the
cursed
whiskey
bottle
i
remember
the
first
hunting
excursion
i
took
alone
in
the
forest
how
sad
and
gloomy
i
felt
i
thought
that
there
was
no
creature
in
the
world
so
miserable
as
myself
i
was
tired
and
hungry
and
i
sat
down
upon
a
fallen
tree
to
rest
all
was
still
as
death
around
me
and
i
was
fast
sinking
to
sleep
when
my
attention
was
aroused
by
a
long
wild
cry
my
dog
for
i
had
not
chance
then
and
he
no
hunter
pricked
up
his
ears
but
instead
of
answering
with
a
bark
of
defiance
he
crouched
down
trembling
at
my
feet
does
this
mean
i
cried
and
i
cocked
my
rifle
and
sprang
upon
the
log
the
sound
came
nearer
upon
the
wind
it
was
like
the
deep
baying
of
a
pack
of
hounds
in
full
cry
presently
a
noble
deer
rushed
past
me
and
fast
upon
his
trail
i
see
them
now
like
so
many
black
devils
swept
by
a
pack
of
ten
or
fifteen
large
fierce
wolves
with
fiery
eyes
and
bristling
hair
and
paws
that
seemed
hardly
to
touch
the
ground
in
their
eager
haste
i
thought
not
of
danger
for
with
their
prey
in
view
i
was
safe
but
i
felt
every
nerve
within
me
tremble
for
the
fate
of
the
poor
deer
the
wolves
gained
upon
him
at
every
bound
a
close
thicket
intercepted
his
path
and
rendered
desperate
he
turned
at
bay
his
nostrils
were
dilated
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
send
forth
long
streams
of
light
it
was
wonderful
to
witness
the
courage
of
the
beast
how
bravely
he
repelled
the
attacks
of
his
deadly
enemies
how
gallantly
he
tossed
them
to
the
right
and
left
and
spurned
them
from
beneath
his
hoofs
yet
all
his
struggles
were
useless
and
he
was
quickly
overcome
and
torn
to
pieces
by
his
ravenous
foes
at
that
moment
he
seemed
more
unfortunate
than
even
myself
for
i
could
not
see
in
what
manner
he
had
deserved
his
fate
all
his
speed
and
energy
his
courage
and
fortitude
had
been
exerted
in
vain
i
had
tried
to
destroy
myself
but
he
with
every
effort
vigorously
made
for
was
doomed
to
meet
the
fate
he
dreaded
is
god
just
to
his
creatures
with
this
sentence
on
his
lips
he
started
abruptly
from
his
seat
and
left
the
house
one
day
he
found
me
painting
some
wild
flowers
and
was
greatly
interested
in
watching
the
progress
i
made
in
the
group
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
he
brought
me
a
large
bunch
of
splendid
spring
flowers
draw
these
said
he
i
have
been
all
the
way
to
the
lake
plains
to
find
them
for
little
katie
grasping
them
one
by
one
with
infantile
joy
kissed
every
lovely
blossom
these
are
god
pictures
said
the
hunter
and
the
child
who
is
all
nature
understands
them
in
a
minute
is
it
not
strange
that
these
beautiful
things
are
hid
away
in
the
wilderness
where
no
eyes
but
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
wood
and
the
insects
that
live
upon
them
ever
see
them
does
god
provide
for
the
pleasure
of
such
creatures
these
flowers
is
his
benevolence
gratified
by
the
admiration
of
animals
whom
we
have
been
taught
to
consider
as
having
neither
thought
nor
reflection
when
i
am
alone
in
the
forest
these
thoughts
puzzle
knowing
that
to
argue
with
brian
was
only
to
call
into
action
the
slumbering
fires
of
his
fatal
malady
i
turned
the
conversation
by
asking
him
why
he
called
his
favourite
dog
chance
i
found
him
he
said
forty
miles
back
in
the
bush
he
was
a
mere
skeleton
at
first
i
took
him
for
a
wolf
but
the
shape
of
his
head
undeceived
me
i
opened
my
wallet
and
called
him
to
me
he
came
slowly
stopping
and
wagging
his
tail
at
every
step
and
looking
me
wistfully
in
the
face
i
offered
him
a
bit
of
dried
venison
and
he
soon
became
friendly
and
followed
me
home
and
has
never
left
me
since
i
called
him
chance
after
the
manner
i
happened
with
him
and
i
would
not
part
with
him
for
twenty
alas
for
poor
chance
he
had
unknown
to
his
master
contracted
a
private
liking
for
fresh
mutton
and
one
night
he
killed
no
less
than
eight
sheep
that
belonged
to
d
on
the
front
road
the
culprit
who
had
been
long
suspected
was
caught
in
the
very
act
and
this
mischance
cost
him
his
life
brian
was
sad
and
gloomy
for
many
weeks
after
his
favourite
death
i
would
have
restored
the
sheep
fourfold
he
said
if
he
would
but
have
spared
the
life
of
my
my
recollections
of
brian
seemed
more
particularly
to
concentrate
in
the
adventures
of
one
night
when
i
happened
to
be
left
alone
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival
in
canada
i
can
not
now
imagine
how
i
could
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
give
way
for
hours
to
such
childish
fears
but
so
it
was
and
i
will
not
disguise
my
weakness
from
my
indulgent
reader
moodie
had
bought
a
very
fine
cow
of
a
black
man
named
mollineux
for
which
he
was
to
give
dollars
the
man
lived
twelve
miles
back
in
the
woods
and
one
fine
frosty
spring
day
smile
at
the
term
frosty
thus
connected
with
the
genial
season
of
the
year
the
term
is
perfectly
correct
when
applied
to
the
canadian
spring
which
until
the
middle
of
may
is
the
most
dismal
season
of
the
year
he
and
john
monaghan
took
a
rope
and
the
dog
and
sallied
forth
to
fetch
the
cow
home
moodie
said
that
they
should
be
back
by
six
in
the
evening
and
charged
me
to
have
something
cooked
for
supper
when
they
returned
as
he
doubted
not
their
long
walk
in
the
sharp
air
would
give
them
a
good
appetite
this
was
during
the
time
that
i
was
without
a
servant
and
living
in
old
shanty
the
day
was
so
bright
and
clear
and
katie
was
so
full
of
frolic
and
play
rolling
upon
the
floor
or
toddling
from
chair
to
chair
that
the
day
passed
on
without
my
feeling
remarkably
lonely
at
length
the
evening
drew
nigh
and
i
began
to
expect
my
husband
return
and
to
think
of
the
supper
that
i
was
to
prepare
for
his
reception
the
red
heifer
that
we
had
bought
of
layton
came
lowing
to
the
door
to
be
milked
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
milk
in
those
days
and
besides
this
i
was
terribly
afraid
of
cattle
yet
as
i
knew
that
milk
would
be
required
for
the
tea
i
ran
across
the
meadow
to
joe
and
begged
that
one
of
her
girls
would
be
so
kind
as
to
milk
for
me
my
request
was
greeted
with
a
rude
burst
of
laughter
from
the
whole
set
if
you
ca
milk
said
joe
it
high
time
you
should
learn
my
girls
are
above
being
i
would
not
ask
you
but
as
a
great
favour
i
am
afraid
of
afraid
of
cows
lord
bless
the
woman
a
farmer
wife
and
afraid
of
cows
here
followed
another
laugh
at
my
expense
and
indignant
at
the
refusal
of
my
first
and
last
request
when
they
had
all
borrowed
so
much
from
me
i
shut
the
inhospitable
door
and
returned
home
after
many
ineffectual
attempts
i
succeeded
at
last
and
bore
my
of
milk
in
triumph
to
the
house
yes
i
felt
prouder
of
that
milk
than
many
an
author
of
the
best
thing
he
ever
wrote
whether
in
verse
or
prose
and
it
was
doubly
sweet
when
i
considered
that
i
had
procured
it
without
being
under
any
obligation
to
my
neighbours
i
had
learned
a
useful
lesson
of
independence
to
which
in
i
had
often
again
to
refer
i
fed
little
katie
and
put
her
to
bed
made
the
hot
cakes
for
tea
boiled
the
potatoes
and
laid
the
ham
cut
in
nice
slices
in
the
pan
ready
to
cook
the
moment
i
saw
the
men
enter
the
meadow
and
arranged
the
little
room
with
scrupulous
care
and
neatness
a
glorious
fire
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
and
everything
was
ready
for
their
supper
and
i
began
to
look
out
anxiously
for
their
arrival
the
night
had
closed
in
cold
and
foggy
and
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
any
object
at
more
than
a
few
yards
from
the
door
bringing
in
as
much
wood
as
i
thought
would
last
me
for
several
hours
i
closed
the
door
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
found
myself
at
night
in
a
house
entirely
alone
then
i
began
to
ask
myself
a
thousand
torturing
questions
as
to
the
reason
of
their
unusual
absence
had
they
lost
their
way
in
the
woods
could
they
have
fallen
in
with
wolves
one
of
my
early
bugbears
could
any
fatal
accident
have
befallen
them
i
started
up
opened
the
door
held
my
breath
and
listened
the
little
brook
lifted
up
its
voice
in
loud
hoarse
wailing
or
mocked
in
its
babbling
to
the
stones
the
sound
of
human
voices
as
it
became
later
my
fears
increased
in
proportion
i
grew
too
superstitious
and
nervous
to
keep
the
door
open
i
not
only
closed
it
but
dragged
a
heavy
box
in
front
for
bolt
there
was
none
several
men
had
during
the
day
asked
their
way
to
toronto
i
felt
alarmed
lest
such
rude
wayfarers
should
come
and
demand
a
lodging
and
find
me
alone
and
unprotected
once
i
thought
of
running
across
to
joe
and
asking
her
to
let
one
of
the
girls
stay
with
me
until
moodie
returned
but
the
way
in
which
i
had
been
repulsed
in
the
evening
prevented
me
from
making
a
second
appeal
to
their
charity
hour
after
hour
wore
away
and
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
proclaimed
midnight
and
yet
they
came
not
i
had
burnt
out
all
my
wood
and
i
dared
not
open
the
door
to
fetch
in
more
the
candle
was
expiring
in
the
socket
and
i
had
not
courage
to
go
up
into
the
loft
and
procure
another
before
it
went
finally
out
cold
and
faint
i
sat
and
cried
every
now
and
then
the
furious
barking
of
the
dogs
at
the
neighbouring
farms
and
the
loud
cackling
of
the
geese
upon
our
own
made
me
hope
that
they
were
coming
and
then
i
listened
till
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
excluded
all
other
sounds
oh
that
unwearied
brook
how
it
sobbed
and
moaned
like
a
fretful
child
what
unreal
terrors
and
fanciful
illusions
my
too
active
mind
conjured
up
whilst
listening
to
its
mysterious
tones
just
as
the
moon
rose
the
howling
of
a
pack
of
wolves
from
the
great
swamp
in
our
rear
filled
the
whole
air
their
yells
were
answered
by
the
barking
of
all
the
dogs
in
the
vicinity
and
the
geese
unwilling
to
be
in
the
general
confusion
set
up
the
most
discordant
screams
i
had
often
heard
and
even
been
amused
during
the
winter
particularly
on
thaw
nights
with
hearing
the
howls
of
these
formidable
wild
beasts
but
i
had
never
before
heard
them
alone
and
when
one
dear
to
me
was
abroad
amid
their
haunts
they
were
directly
in
the
track
that
moodie
and
monaghan
must
have
taken
and
i
now
made
no
doubt
that
they
had
been
attacked
and
killed
on
their
return
through
the
woods
with
the
cow
and
i
wept
and
sobbed
until
the
cold
grey
dawn
peered
in
upon
me
through
the
small
dim
window
i
have
passed
many
a
long
cheerless
night
when
my
dear
husband
was
away
from
me
during
the
rebellion
and
i
was
left
in
my
forest
home
with
five
little
children
and
only
an
old
irish
woman
to
draw
and
cut
wood
for
my
fire
and
attend
to
the
wants
of
the
family
but
that
was
the
saddest
and
longest
night
i
ever
remember
just
as
the
day
broke
my
friends
the
wolves
set
up
a
parting
benediction
so
loud
and
wild
and
near
to
the
house
that
i
was
afraid
lest
they
should
break
through
the
frail
window
or
come
down
the
low
wide
chimney
and
rob
me
of
my
child
but
their
detestable
howls
died
away
in
the
distance
and
the
bright
sun
rose
up
and
dispersed
the
wild
horrors
of
the
night
and
i
looked
once
more
timidly
around
me
the
sight
of
the
table
spread
and
the
uneaten
supper
renewed
my
grief
for
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
moodie
was
dead
i
opened
the
door
and
stepped
forth
into
the
pure
air
of
the
early
day
a
solemn
and
beautiful
repose
still
hung
like
a
veil
over
the
face
of
nature
the
mists
of
night
still
rested
upon
the
majestic
woods
and
not
a
sound
but
the
flowing
of
the
waters
went
up
in
the
vast
stillness
the
earth
had
not
yet
raised
her
matin
hymn
to
the
throne
of
the
creator
sad
at
heart
and
weary
and
worn
in
spirit
i
went
down
to
the
spring
and
washed
my
face
and
head
and
drank
a
deep
draught
of
its
icy
waters
on
returning
to
the
house
i
met
near
the
door
old
brian
the
hunter
with
a
large
fox
dangling
across
his
shoulder
and
the
dogs
following
at
his
heels
good
god
moodie
what
is
the
matter
you
are
early
abroad
this
morning
and
look
dreadful
is
anything
wrong
at
home
is
the
baby
or
your
husband
sick
oh
i
cried
bursting
into
tears
i
fear
he
is
killed
by
the
the
man
stared
at
me
as
if
he
doubted
the
evidence
of
his
senses
and
well
he
might
but
this
one
idea
had
taken
such
strong
possession
of
my
mind
that
i
could
admit
no
other
i
then
told
him
as
well
as
i
could
find
words
the
cause
of
my
alarm
to
which
he
listened
very
kindly
and
patiently
set
your
heart
at
rest
your
husband
is
safe
it
is
a
long
journey
on
foot
to
mollineux
to
one
unacquainted
with
a
blazed
path
in
a
bush
road
they
have
stayed
all
night
at
the
black
man
shanty
and
you
will
see
them
back
at
i
shook
my
head
and
continued
to
weep
well
now
in
order
to
satisfy
you
i
will
saddle
my
mare
and
ride
over
to
the
nigger
and
bring
you
word
as
fast
as
i
i
thanked
him
sincerely
for
his
kindness
and
returned
in
somewhat
better
spirits
to
the
house
at
ten
my
good
messenger
returned
with
the
glad
tidings
that
all
was
well
the
day
before
when
half
the
journey
had
been
accomplished
john
monaghan
let
go
the
rope
by
which
he
led
the
cow
and
she
had
broken
away
through
the
woods
and
returned
to
her
old
master
and
when
they
again
reached
his
place
night
had
set
in
and
they
were
obliged
to
wait
until
the
return
of
day
moodie
laughed
heartily
at
all
my
fears
but
indeed
i
found
them
no
joke
brian
eldest
son
a
lad
of
fourteen
was
not
exactly
an
idiot
but
what
in
the
old
country
is
very
expressively
termed
by
the
poor
people
a
he
could
feed
and
assist
himself
had
been
taught
imperfectly
to
read
and
write
and
could
go
to
and
from
the
town
on
errands
and
carry
a
message
from
one
to
another
but
he
was
a
strange
wayward
creature
and
evidently
inherited
in
no
small
degree
his
father
malady
during
the
summer
months
he
lived
entirely
in
the
woods
near
his
father
dwelling
only
returning
to
obtain
food
which
was
generally
left
for
him
in
an
outhouse
in
the
winter
driven
home
by
the
severity
of
the
weather
he
would
sit
for
days
together
moping
in
the
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
what
was
passing
around
him
brian
never
mentioned
this
boy
who
had
a
strong
active
figure
a
handsome
but
very
inexpressive
face
without
a
deep
sigh
and
i
feel
certain
that
half
his
own
dejection
was
occasioned
by
the
mental
aberration
of
his
child
one
day
he
sent
the
lad
with
a
note
to
our
house
to
know
if
moodie
would
purchase
the
half
of
an
ox
that
he
was
going
to
kill
there
happened
to
stand
in
the
corner
of
the
room
an
open
wood
box
into
which
several
bushels
of
fine
apples
had
been
thrown
and
while
moodie
was
writing
an
answer
to
the
note
the
eyes
of
the
idiot
were
fastened
as
if
by
some
magnetic
influence
upon
the
apples
knowing
that
brian
had
a
very
fine
orchard
i
did
not
offer
the
boy
any
of
the
fruit
when
the
note
was
finished
i
handed
it
to
him
the
lad
grasped
it
mechanically
without
removing
his
fixed
gaze
from
the
apples
give
that
to
your
father
the
boy
answered
not
his
ears
his
eyes
his
whole
soul
were
concentrated
in
the
apples
ten
minutes
elapsed
but
he
stood
motionless
like
a
pointer
at
dead
set
my
good
boy
you
can
he
did
not
stir
is
there
anything
you
want
i
want
said
the
lad
without
moving
his
eyes
from
the
objects
of
his
intense
desire
and
speaking
in
a
slow
pointed
manner
which
ought
to
have
been
heard
to
be
fully
appreciated
i
want
oh
if
that
all
take
what
you
the
permission
once
obtained
the
boy
flung
himself
upon
the
box
with
the
rapacity
of
a
hawk
upon
its
prey
after
being
long
poised
in
the
air
to
fix
its
certain
aim
thrusting
his
hands
to
the
right
and
left
in
order
to
secure
the
finest
specimens
of
the
coveted
fruit
scarcely
allowing
himself
time
to
breathe
until
he
had
filled
his
old
straw
hat
and
all
his
pockets
with
apples
to
help
laughing
was
impossible
while
this
new
tom
o
bedlam
darted
from
the
house
and
scampered
across
the
field
for
dear
life
as
if
afraid
that
we
should
pursue
him
to
rob
him
of
his
prize
it
was
during
this
winter
that
our
friend
brian
was
left
a
fortune
of
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
but
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
return
to
his
native
country
in
order
to
take
possession
of
the
property
this
he
positively
refused
to
do
and
when
we
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
apparent
imbecility
of
this
resolution
he
declared
that
he
would
not
risk
his
life
in
crossing
the
atlantic
twice
for
twenty
times
that
sum
what
strange
inconsistency
was
this
in
a
being
who
had
three
times
attempted
to
take
away
that
which
he
dreaded
so
much
to
lose
accidentally
i
was
much
amused
with
an
account
which
he
gave
me
in
his
quaint
way
of
an
excursion
he
went
upon
with
a
botanist
to
collect
specimens
of
the
plants
and
flowers
of
upper
canada
it
was
a
fine
spring
day
some
ten
years
ago
and
i
was
yoking
my
oxen
to
drag
in
some
oats
i
had
just
sown
when
a
little
fat
punchy
man
with
a
broad
red
face
and
carrying
a
small
black
leathern
wallet
across
his
shoulder
called
to
me
over
the
fence
and
asked
me
if
my
name
was
brian
b
i
said
what
of
that
you
are
the
man
i
want
to
see
they
tell
me
that
you
are
better
acquainted
with
the
woods
than
any
person
in
these
parts
and
i
will
pay
you
anything
in
reason
if
you
will
be
my
guide
for
a
few
days
do
you
want
to
go
said
i
in
particular
says
he
want
to
go
here
and
there
in
all
directions
to
collect
plants
and
flowers
that
is
with
a
vengeance
thought
i
i
must
drag
in
my
oats
if
will
suit
we
will
be
off
your
charge
said
he
like
to
be
certain
of
that
dollar
a
day
my
time
and
labour
upon
my
farm
at
this
busy
season
is
worth
more
than
that
said
he
i
give
you
what
you
ask
at
what
time
will
you
be
ready
to
start
daybreak
if
you
wish
it
away
he
went
and
by
daylight
next
morning
he
was
at
my
door
mounted
upon
a
stout
french
pony
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
beast
said
i
are
of
no
use
on
the
road
that
you
and
i
are
to
travel
you
had
better
leave
him
in
my
stable
want
him
to
carry
my
traps
said
he
may
be
some
days
that
we
shall
be
absent
i
assured
him
that
he
must
be
his
own
beast
of
burthen
and
carry
his
axe
and
blanket
and
wallet
of
food
upon
his
own
back
the
little
body
did
not
much
relish
this
arrangement
but
as
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
very
complied
off
we
set
and
soon
climbed
the
steep
ridge
at
the
back
of
your
farm
and
got
upon
lake
plains
the
woods
were
flush
with
flowers
and
the
little
man
grew
into
such
an
ecstacy
that
at
every
fresh
specimen
he
uttered
a
yell
of
joy
cut
a
caper
in
the
air
and
flung
himself
down
upon
them
as
if
he
was
drunk
with
delight
what
treasures
what
treasures
he
cried
shall
make
my
fortune
it
is
seldom
i
laugh
quoth
brian
but
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
odd
little
man
for
it
was
not
the
beautiful
blossoms
such
as
you
delight
to
paint
that
drew
forth
these
exclamations
but
the
queer
little
plants
which
he
had
rummaged
for
at
the
roots
of
old
trees
among
the
moss
and
long
grass
he
sat
upon
a
decayed
trunk
which
lay
in
our
path
i
do
believe
for
a
long
hour
making
an
oration
over
some
greyish
things
spotted
with
red
that
grew
upon
it
which
looked
more
like
mould
than
plants
declaring
himself
repaid
for
all
the
trouble
and
expense
he
had
been
at
if
it
were
only
to
obtain
a
sight
of
them
i
gathered
him
a
beautiful
blossom
of
the
lady
slipper
but
he
pushed
it
back
when
i
presented
it
to
him
saying
yes
is
very
fine
i
have
seen
that
often
before
but
these
lichens
are
splendid
the
man
had
so
little
taste
that
i
thought
him
a
fool
and
so
i
left
him
to
talk
to
his
dear
plants
while
i
shot
partridges
for
our
supper
we
spent
six
days
in
the
woods
and
the
little
man
filled
his
black
wallet
with
all
sorts
of
rubbish
as
if
he
wilfully
shut
his
eyes
to
the
beautiful
flowers
and
chose
only
to
admire
ugly
insignificant
plants
that
everybody
else
passes
by
without
noticing
and
which
often
as
i
had
been
in
the
woods
i
never
had
observed
before
i
never
pursued
a
deer
with
such
earnestness
as
he
continued
his
hunt
for
what
he
called
when
we
came
to
the
cold
creek
which
is
pretty
deep
in
places
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
at
some
plants
that
grew
under
the
water
that
in
reaching
after
them
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
head
over
heels
into
the
stream
he
got
a
thorough
ducking
and
was
in
a
terrible
fright
but
he
held
on
to
the
flowers
which
had
caused
the
trouble
and
thanked
his
stars
that
he
had
saved
them
as
well
as
his
life
well
he
was
an
innocent
man
continued
brian
a
very
little
made
him
happy
and
at
night
he
would
sing
and
amuse
himself
like
a
child
he
gave
me
ten
dollars
for
my
trouble
and
i
never
saw
him
again
but
i
often
think
of
him
when
hunting
in
the
woods
that
we
wandered
through
together
and
i
pluck
the
wee
plants
that
he
used
to
admire
and
wonder
why
he
preferred
them
to
the
fine
when
our
resolution
was
formed
to
sell
our
farm
and
take
up
our
grant
of
land
in
the
backwoods
no
one
was
so
earnest
in
trying
to
persuade
us
to
give
up
this
ruinous
scheme
as
our
friend
brian
b
who
became
quite
eloquent
in
his
description
of
the
trials
and
sorrows
that
awaited
us
during
the
last
week
of
our
stay
in
the
township
of
h
he
visited
us
every
evening
and
never
bade
us
without
a
tear
moistening
his
cheek
we
parted
with
the
hunter
as
with
an
old
friend
and
we
never
met
again
his
fate
was
a
sad
one
after
we
left
that
part
of
the
country
he
fell
into
a
moping
melancholy
which
ended
in
but
a
kinder
man
while
he
enjoyed
the
light
of
reason
has
seldom
crossed
our
path
the
dying
hunter
to
his
dog
lie
down
lie
down
my
noble

joyful

thou
along

track
the
flying

cold

in
chill
oblivion

thee

lengthened
shadows
they
cast
upon

silently

surely
foreshow
the
bursting
of

who
that
has

can
mistake
the
language
of
the
waves
that
deep
prophetic
surging
that
ushers
in
the
terrible
gale
so
it
is
with
the
human
heart
it
has
its
mysterious
warnings
its
fits
of
sunshine
and
shade
of
storm
and
calm
now
elevated
with
anticipations
of
joy
now
depressed
by
dark
presentiments
of
all
who
have
ever
trodden
this
earth
possessed
of
the
powers
of
thought
and
reflection
of
tracing
effects
back
to
their
causes
have
listened
to
these
voices
of
the
soul
and
secretly
acknowledged
their
power
but
few
very
few
have
had
courage
boldly
to
declare
their
belief
in
them
the
wisest
and
the
best
have
given
credence
to
them
and
the
experience
of
every
day
proves
their
truth
yea
the
proverbs
of
past
ages
abound
with
allusions
to
the
same
subject
and
though
the
worldly
may
sneer
and
the
good
man
reprobate
the
belief
in
a
theory
which
he
considers
dangerous
yet
the
former
when
he
appears
led
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
enter
into
some
fortunate
but
until
then
speculation
and
the
latter
when
he
devoutly
exclaims
that
god
has
met
him
in
prayer
unconsciously
acknowledge
the
same
spiritual
agency
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
doubts
upon
the
subject
and
have
found
many
times
and
at
different
periods
of
my
life
that
the
voice
in
the
soul
speaks
truly
that
if
we
gave
stricter
heed
to
its
mysterious
warnings
we
should
be
saved
much
well
do
i
remember
how
sternly
and
solemnly
this
inward
monitor
warned
me
of
approaching
ill
the
last
night
i
spent
at
home
how
it
strove
to
draw
me
back
as
from
a
fearful
abyss
beseeching
me
not
to
leave
england
and
emigrate
to
canada
and
how
gladly
would
i
have
obeyed
the
injunction
had
it
still
been
in
my
power
i
had
bowed
to
a
superior
mandate
the
command
of
duty
for
my
husband
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
infant
whose
little
bosom
heaved
against
my
swelling
heart
i
had
consented
to
bid
adieu
for
ever
to
my
native
shores
and
it
seemed
both
useless
and
sinful
to
draw
back
yet
by
what
stern
necessity
were
we
driven
forth
to
seek
a
new
home
amid
the
western
wilds
we
were
not
compelled
to
emigrate
bound
to
england
by
a
thousand
holy
and
endearing
ties
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
chosen
friends
and
happy
in
each
other
love
we
possessed
all
that
the
world
can
bestow
of
good
but
the
of
a
subaltern
officer
managed
with
the
most
rigid
economy
is
too
small
to
supply
the
wants
of
a
family
and
if
of
a
good
family
not
enough
to
maintain
his
original
standing
in
society
true
it
may
find
his
children
bread
it
may
clothe
them
indifferently
but
it
leaves
nothing
for
the
indispensable
requirements
of
education
or
the
painful
contingencies
of
sickness
and
misfortune
in
such
a
case
it
is
both
wise
and
right
to
emigrate
nature
points
it
out
as
the
only
safe
remedy
for
the
evils
arising
out
of
an
population
and
her
advice
is
always
founded
upon
justice
and
truth
up
to
the
period
of
which
i
now
speak
we
had
not
experienced
much
inconvenience
from
our
very
limited
means
our
wants
were
few
and
we
enjoyed
many
of
the
comforts
and
even
some
of
the
luxuries
of
life
and
all
had
gone
on
smoothly
and
lovingly
with
us
until
the
birth
of
our
first
child
it
was
then
that
prudence
whispered
to
the
father
you
are
happy
and
contented
now
but
this
can
not
always
last
the
birth
of
that
child
whom
you
have
hailed
with
as
much
rapture
as
though
she
were
born
to
inherit
a
noble
estate
is
to
you
the
beginning
of
care
your
family
may
increase
and
your
wants
will
increase
in
proportion
out
of
what
fund
can
you
satisfy
their
demands
some
provision
must
be
made
for
the
future
and
made
quickly
while
youth
and
health
enable
you
to
combat
successfully
with
the
ills
of
life
when
you
married
for
inclination
you
knew
that
emigration
must
be
the
result
of
such
an
act
of
imprudence
in
england
up
and
be
doing
while
you
still
possess
the
means
of
transporting
yourself
to
a
land
where
the
industrious
can
never
lack
bread
and
where
there
is
a
chance
that
wealth
and
independence
may
reward
virtuous
alas
that
truth
should
ever
whisper
such
unpleasant
realities
to
the
lover
of
ease
to
the
poet
the
author
the
musician
the
man
of
books
of
refined
taste
and
gentlemanly
habits
yet
he
took
the
hint
and
began
to
bestir
himself
with
the
spirit
and
energy
so
characteristic
of
the
glorious
north
from
whence
he
sprung
the
sacrifice
he
said
must
be
made
and
the
sooner
the
better
my
dear
wife
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
respond
to
the
call
of
duty
and
and
we
will
go
forth
to
meet
difficulties
and
by
the
help
of
god
to
subdue
dear
husband
i
take
shame
to
myself
that
my
purpose
was
less
firm
that
my
heart
lingered
so
far
behind
yours
in
preparing
for
this
great
epoch
in
our
lives
that
like
lot
wife
i
still
turned
and
looked
back
and
clung
with
all
my
strength
to
the
land
i
was
leaving
it
was
not
the
hardships
of
an
emigrant
life
i
dreaded
i
could
bear
mere
physical
privations
philosophically
enough
it
was
the
loss
of
the
society
in
which
i
had
moved
the
want
of
congenial
minds
of
persons
engaged
in
congenial
pursuits
that
made
me
so
reluctant
to
respond
to
my
husband
call
i
was
the
youngest
in
a
family
remarkable
for
their
literary
attainments
and
while
yet
a
child
i
had
seen
riches
melt
away
from
our
once
prosperous
home
as
the
canadian
snows
dissolve
before
the
first
warm
days
of
spring
leaving
the
verdureless
earth
naked
and
bare
there
was
however
a
spirit
in
my
family
that
rose
superior
to
the
crushing
influences
of
adversity
poverty
which
so
often
degrades
the
weak
mind
became
their
best
teacher
the
stern
but
fruitful
parent
of
high
resolve
and
ennobling
thought
the
very
misfortunes
that
overwhelmed
became
the
source
from
whence
they
derived
both
energy
and
strength
as
the
inundation
of
some
mighty
river
fertilises
the
shores
over
which
it
first
spreads
ruin
and
desolation
without
losing
aught
of
their
former
position
in
society
they
dared
to
be
poor
to
place
mind
above
matter
and
make
the
talents
with
which
the
great
father
had
liberally
endowed
them
work
out
their
appointed
end
the
world
sneered
and
summer
friends
forsook
them
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
world
and
upon
the
ephemeral
tribes
that
live
but
in
its
smiles
from
out
of
the
solitude
in
which
they
dwelt
their
names
went
forth
through
the
crowded
cities
of
that
cold
sneering
world
and
their
names
were
mentioned
with
respect
by
the
wise
and
good
and
what
they
lost
in
wealth
they
more
than
regained
in
reputation
brought
up
in
this
school
of
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
all
its
wise
and
holy
precepts
had
brought
forth
no
corresponding
fruit
i
endeavoured
to
reconcile
myself
to
the
change
that
awaited
me
to
accommodate
my
mind
and
pursuits
to
the
new
position
in
which
i
found
myself
placed
many
a
hard
battle
had
we
to
fight
with
old
prejudices
and
many
proud
swellings
of
the
heart
to
subdue
before
we
could
feel
the
least
interest
in
the
land
of
our
adoption
or
look
upon
it
as
our
home
all
was
new
strange
and
distasteful
to
us
we
shrank
from
the
rude
coarse
familiarity
of
the
uneducated
people
among
whom
we
were
thrown
and
they
in
return
viewed
us
as
innovators
who
wished
to
curtail
their
independence
by
expecting
from
them
the
kindly
civilities
and
gentle
courtesies
of
a
more
refined
community
they
considered
us
proud
and
shy
when
we
were
only
anxious
not
to
give
offense
the
yankee
squatters
who
had
left
their
country
for
their
country
good
and
by
whom
we
were
surrounded
in
our
first
settlement
detested
us
and
with
them
we
could
have
no
feeling
in
common
we
could
neither
lie
nor
cheat
in
our
dealings
with
them
and
they
despised
us
for
our
ignorance
in
trading
and
our
want
of
smartness
the
utter
want
of
that
common
courtesy
with
which
a
european
addresses
the
poorest
of
his
brethren
is
severely
felt
at
first
by
settlers
in
canada
at
the
period
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
the
titles
of
sir
or
madam
were
very
rarely
applied
by
inferiors
they
entered
your
house
without
knocking
and
while
boasting
of
their
freedom
violated
one
of
its
dearest
laws
which
considers
even
the
cottage
of
the
poorest
labourer
his
castle
and
his
privacy
sacred
is
your
man
to
hum
is
the
woman
within
were
the
general
inquiries
made
to
me
by
such
guests
while
my
ragged
irish
servants
were
always
spoken
to
as
sir
and
mem
as
if
to
make
the
distinction
more
pointed
why
they
treated
our
claims
to
their
respect
with
marked
insult
and
rudeness
i
never
could
satisfactorily
determine
in
any
way
that
could
reflect
honour
on
the
species
or
even
plead
an
excuse
for
its
brutality
until
i
found
that
this
insolence
was
more
generally
practised
by
the
low
uneducated
emigrants
from
britain
who
better
understood
your
claims
to
their
civility
than
by
the
natives
themselves
then
i
discovered
the
secret
the
unnatural
restraint
which
society
imposes
upon
these
people
at
home
forces
them
to
treat
their
more
fortunate
brethren
with
a
servile
deference
which
is
repugnant
to
their
feelings
and
is
thrust
upon
them
by
the
dependent
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
this
homage
to
rank
and
education
is
not
sincere
hatred
and
envy
lie
rankling
at
their
heart
although
hidden
by
outward
obsequiousness
necessity
compels
their
obedience
they
fawn
and
cringe
and
flatter
the
wealth
on
which
they
depend
for
bread
but
let
them
once
emigrate
the
clog
which
fettered
them
is
suddenly
removed
they
are
free
and
the
dearest
privilege
of
this
freedom
is
to
wreak
upon
their
superiors
the
hatred
of
their
hearts
they
think
they
can
debase
you
to
their
level
by
disallowing
all
your
claims
to
distinction
while
they
hope
to
exalt
themselves
and
their
fellows
into
ladies
and
gentlemen
by
sinking
you
back
to
the
only
title
you
received
from
nature
plain
man
and
oh
how
much
more
honourable
than
their
vulgar
pretensions
i
never
knew
the
real
dignity
of
these
simple
epithets
until
they
were
insultingly
thrust
upon
us
by
the
of
canada
but
from
this
folly
the
canadian
is
exempt
it
is
only
practised
by
the
yankee
or
the
yankeefied
british
peasantry
and
mechanics
it
originates
in
the
enormous
reaction
springing
out
of
a
sudden
emancipation
from
a
state
of
utter
dependence
to
one
of
unrestrained
liberty
as
such
i
not
only
excuse
but
forgive
it
for
the
principle
is
founded
in
nature
and
however
disgusting
and
distasteful
to
those
accustomed
to
different
treatment
from
their
inferiors
it
is
better
than
a
hollow
profession
of
duty
and
attachment
urged
upon
us
by
a
false
and
unnatural
position
still
it
is
very
irksome
until
you
think
more
deeply
upon
it
and
then
it
serves
to
amuse
rather
than
to
irritate
and
here
i
would
observe
before
quitting
this
subject
that
of
all
follies
that
of
taking
out
servants
from
the
old
country
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
is
sure
to
end
in
the
loss
of
the
money
expended
in
their
passage
and
to
become
the
cause
of
deep
disappointment
and
mortification
to
yourself
they
no
sooner
set
foot
upon
the
canadian
shores
then
they
become
possessed
with
this
spirit
all
respect
for
their
employers
all
subordination
is
at
an
end
the
very
air
of
canada
severs
the
tie
of
mutual
obligation
which
bound
you
together
they
fancy
themselves
not
only
equal
to
you
in
rank
but
that
ignorance
and
vulgarity
give
them
superior
claims
to
notice
they
demand
in
terms
the
highest
wages
and
grumble
at
doing
half
the
work
in
return
which
they
cheerfully
performed
at
home
they
demand
to
eat
at
your
table
and
to
sit
in
your
company
and
if
you
refuse
to
listen
to
their
dishonest
and
extravagant
claims
they
tell
you
that
they
are
free
that
no
contract
signed
in
the
old
country
is
binding
in
that
you
may
look
out
for
another
person
to
fill
their
place
as
soon
as
you
like
and
that
you
may
get
the
money
expended
in
their
passage
and
outfit
in
the
best
manner
you
i
was
unfortunately
persuaded
to
take
out
a
woman
with
me
as
a
nurse
for
my
child
during
the
voyage
as
i
was
in
very
poor
health
and
her
conduct
and
the
trouble
and
expense
she
occasioned
were
a
perfect
illustration
of
what
i
have
described
when
we
consider
the
different
position
in
which
servants
are
placed
in
the
old
and
new
world
this
conduct
ungrateful
as
it
then
appeared
to
me
ought
not
to
create
the
least
surprise
in
britain
for
instance
they
are
too
often
dependent
upon
the
caprice
of
their
employers
for
bread
their
wages
are
low
their
moral
condition
still
lower
they
are
brought
up
in
the
most
servile
fear
of
the
higher
classes
and
they
feel
most
keenly
their
hopeless
degradation
for
no
effort
on
their
part
can
better
their
condition
they
know
that
if
once
they
get
a
bad
character
they
must
starve
or
steal
and
to
this
conviction
we
are
indebted
for
a
great
deal
of
their
seeming
fidelity
and
long
and
laborious
service
in
our
families
which
we
owe
less
to
any
moral
perception
on
their
part
of
the
superior
kindness
or
excellence
of
their
employers
than
to
the
mere
feeling
of
assurance
that
as
long
as
they
do
their
work
well
and
are
cheerful
and
obedient
they
will
be
punctually
paid
their
wages
and
well
housed
and
fed
happy
is
it
for
them
and
their
masters
when
even
this
selfish
bond
of
union
exists
between
them
but
in
canada
the
state
of
things
in
this
respect
is
wholly
reversed
the
serving
class
comparatively
speaking
is
small
and
admits
of
little
competition
servants
that
understand
the
work
of
the
country
are
not
easily
procured
and
such
always
can
command
the
highest
wages
the
possession
of
a
good
servant
is
such
an
addition
to
comfort
that
they
are
persons
of
no
small
consequence
for
the
dread
of
starving
no
longer
frightens
them
into
servile
obedience
they
can
live
without
you
and
they
well
know
that
you
can
not
do
without
them
if
you
attempt
to
practise
upon
them
that
common
vice
of
english
mistresses
to
scold
them
for
any
slight
omission
or
offence
you
rouse
into
active
operation
all
their
spirit
of
freedom
and
opposition
they
turn
upon
you
with
a
torrent
of
abuse
they
demand
their
wages
and
declare
their
intention
of
quitting
you
instantly
the
more
inconvenient
the
time
for
you
the
more
bitter
become
their
insulting
remarks
they
tell
you
with
a
high
hand
that
they
are
as
good
as
you
that
they
can
get
twenty
better
places
by
the
morrow
and
that
they
do
care
a
snap
for
your
and
away
they
bounce
leaving
you
to
finish
a
large
wash
or
a
heavy
job
of
ironing
in
the
best
way
you
can
when
we
look
upon
such
conduct
as
the
reaction
arising
out
of
their
former
state
we
can
not
so
much
blame
them
and
are
obliged
to
own
that
it
is
the
natural
result
of
a
sudden
emancipation
from
former
restraint
with
all
their
insolent
airs
of
independence
i
must
confess
that
i
prefer
the
canadian
to
the
european
servant
if
they
turn
out
good
and
faithful
it
springs
more
from
real
respect
and
affection
and
you
possess
in
your
domestic
a
valuable
assistant
and
friend
but
this
will
never
be
the
case
with
a
servant
brought
out
with
you
from
the
old
country
for
the
reasons
before
assigned
the
happy
independence
enjoyed
in
this
land
is
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
the
fact
that
no
domestic
can
be
treated
with
cruelty
or
insolence
by
an
unbenevolent
or
arrogant
master
forty
years
has
made
as
great
a
difference
in
the
state
of
society
in
canada
as
it
has
in
its
commercial
and
political
importance
when
we
came
to
the
canadas
society
was
composed
of
elements
which
did
not
always
amalgamate
in
the
best
possible
manner
we
were
reckoned
no
addition
to
the
society
of
c
authors
and
literary
people
they
held
in
supreme
detestation
and
i
was
told
by
a
lady
the
very
first
time
i
appeared
in
company
that
she
heard
that
i
wrote
books
but
she
could
tell
me
that
they
did
not
want
a
trollope
in
i
had
not
then
read
trollope
work
on
america
or
i
should
have
comprehended
at
once
the
cause
of
her
indignation
for
she
was
just
such
a
person
as
would
have
drawn
forth
the
keen
satire
of
that
observer
of
the
absurdities
of
our
nature
whose
witty
exposure
of
american
affectation
has
done
more
towards
producing
a
reform
in
that
respect
than
would
have
resulted
from
a
thousand
grave
animadversions
soberly
written
another
of
my
advisers
informed
me
with
great
asperity
in
her
look
and
tone
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
lay
by
the
pen
and
betake
myself
to
some
more
useful
employment
that
she
thanked
her
god
that
she
could
make
a
shirt
and
see
to
the
cleaning
of
her
house
these
remarks
were
perfectly
gratuitous
and
called
forth
by
no
observation
of
mine
for
i
tried
to
conceal
my
blue
stockings
beneath
the
long
conventional
robes
of
the
tamest
hoping
to
cover
the
faintest
tinge
of
the
objectionable
colour
i
had
spoken
to
neither
of
these
women
in
my
life
and
was
much
amused
by
their
remarks
particularly
as
i
could
both
make
a
shirt
and
attend
to
the
domestic
arrangement
of
my
family
as
well
as
either
of
them
i
verily
believe
that
they
expected
to
find
an
author
one
of
a
distinct
species
from
themselves
that
they
imagined
the
aforesaid
biped
should
neither
eat
drink
sleep
nor
talk
like
other
folks
a
proud
useless
affected
animal
that
deserved
nothing
but
kicks
and
buffets
from
the
rest
of
mankind
anxious
not
to
offend
them
i
tried
to
avoid
all
literary
subjects
i
confined
my
conversation
to
topics
of
common
interest
but
this
gave
greater
offence
than
the
most
ostentatious
show
of
learning
for
they
concluded
that
i
would
not
talk
on
such
subjects
because
i
thought
them
incapable
of
understanding
me
this
was
more
wounding
to
their
than
the
most
arrogant
assumption
on
my
part
and
they
regarded
me
with
a
jealous
envious
that
was
so
intolerable
that
i
gave
up
all
ideas
of
visiting
them
i
was
so
accustomed
to
hear
the
whispered
remark
or
to
have
it
retailed
to
me
by
others
oh
yes
she
can
write
but
she
can
do
nothing
else
that
i
was
made
more
diligent
in
cultivating
every
branch
of
domestic
usefulness
so
that
these
sarcasms
ultimately
led
to
my
acquiring
a
great
mass
of
most
useful
practical
knowledge
yet
such
is
the
contradiction
inherent
in
our
poor
fallen
nature
these
people
were
more
annoyed
by
my
proficiency
in
the
common
labours
of
the
household
than
they
would
have
been
by
any
displays
of
my
unfortunate
authorship
never
was
the
fable
of
the
old
man
and
his
ass
so
truly
verified
there
is
a
very
little
of
the
social
friendly
visiting
among
the
canadians
which
constitutes
the
great
charm
of
home
their
hospitality
is
entirely
reserved
for
those
monster
meetings
in
which
they
vie
with
each
other
in
displaying
fine
clothes
and
costly
furniture
as
these
large
parties
are
very
expensive
few
families
can
afford
to
give
more
than
one
during
the
visiting
season
which
is
almost
exclusively
confined
to
the
winter
the
great
gun
once
fired
you
meet
no
more
at
the
same
house
around
the
social
board
until
the
ensuing
year
and
would
scarcely
know
that
you
had
a
neighbor
were
it
not
for
a
formal
morning
call
made
now
and
then
just
to
remind
you
that
such
individuals
are
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
still
exist
in
your
near
vicinity
i
am
speaking
of
visiting
in
the
towns
and
villages
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
european
settlers
in
the
country
are
far
more
simple
and
natural
and
their
hospitality
more
genuine
and
sincere
they
have
not
been
sophisticated
by
the
hard
worldly
wisdom
of
a
canadian
town
and
still
retain
a
warm
remembrance
of
the
kindly
humanities
of
home
among
the
women
a
love
of
dress
exceeds
all
other
passions
in
public
they
dress
in
silks
and
satins
and
wear
the
most
expensive
ornaments
and
they
display
considerable
taste
in
the
arrangement
and
choice
of
colours
the
wife
of
a
man
in
moderate
circumstances
whose
income
does
not
exceed
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
does
not
hesitate
in
expending
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
upon
one
article
of
outside
finery
while
often
her
inner
garments
are
not
worth
as
many
sous
thus
sacrificing
to
outward
show
all
the
real
comforts
of
life
the
aristocracy
of
wealth
is
bad
enough
but
the
aristocracy
of
dress
is
perfectly
contemptible
could
raphael
visit
canada
in
rags
he
would
be
nothing
in
their
eyes
beyond
a
common
great
and
manifold
even
to
the
ruin
of
families
are
the
evils
arising
from
this
inordinate
love
for
dress
they
derive
their
fashions
from
the
french
and
the
americans
seldom
from
the
english
whom
they
far
surpass
in
the
neatness
and
elegance
of
their
costume
the
canadian
women
while
they
retain
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
are
exceedingly
pretty
but
these
charms
soon
fade
owing
perhaps
to
the
fierce
extremes
of
their
climate
or
the
withering
effect
of
the
dry
metallic
air
of
stoves
and
their
going
too
early
into
company
and
being
exposed
while
yet
children
to
the
noxious
influence
of
late
hours
and
the
sudden
change
from
heated
rooms
to
the
cold
biting
bitter
winter
blast
though
small
of
stature
they
are
generally
well
and
symmetrically
formed
and
possess
a
graceful
easy
carriage
the
early
age
at
which
they
marry
and
are
introduced
into
society
takes
from
them
all
awkwardness
and
restraint
a
girl
of
fourteen
can
enter
a
crowded
with
as
much
and
converse
with
as
much
confidence
as
a
matron
of
forty
the
blush
of
timidity
and
diffidence
is
indeed
rare
upon
the
cheek
of
a
canadian
beauty
their
education
is
so
limited
and
confined
to
so
few
accomplishments
and
these
not
very
perfectly
taught
that
their
conversation
seldom
goes
beyond
a
particular
discussion
on
their
own
dress
or
that
of
their
neighbours
their
houses
furniture
and
servants
sometimes
interlarded
with
a
harmless
which
however
tells
keenly
upon
the
characters
of
their
dear
friends
yet
they
have
abilities
excellent
practical
abilities
which
with
a
little
mental
culture
would
render
them
intellectual
and
charming
companions
at
present
too
many
of
these
truly
lovely
girls
remind
one
of
choice
flowers
half
buried
in
weeds
music
and
dancing
are
their
chief
accomplishments
in
the
former
they
seldom
excel
though
possessing
an
excellent
general
taste
for
music
it
is
seldom
in
their
power
to
bestow
upon
its
study
the
time
which
is
required
to
make
a
really
good
musician
they
are
admirable
proficients
in
the
other
art
which
they
acquire
readily
with
the
least
instruction
often
without
any
instruction
at
all
beyond
that
which
is
given
almost
intuitively
by
a
good
ear
for
time
and
a
quick
perception
of
the
harmony
of
motion
the
waltz
is
their
favorite
dance
in
which
old
and
young
join
with
the
greatest
avidity
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
parents
and
their
children
dancing
in
the
same
set
in
a
public
their
taste
in
music
is
not
for
the
sentimental
they
prefer
the
light
lively
tunes
of
the
virginian
minstrels
to
the
most
impassioned
strains
of
bellini
on
entering
one
of
the
public
a
stranger
would
be
delighted
with
such
a
display
of
pretty
faces
and
neat
figures
i
have
hardly
ever
seen
a
really
plain
canadian
girl
in
her
teens
and
a
downright
ugly
one
is
almost
unknown
the
high
wide
mouth
and
nose
of
the
saxon
race
so
common
among
the
lower
classes
in
britain
are
here
succeeded
in
the
next
generation
by
the
small
oval
face
straight
nose
and
mouth
of
the
american
while
the
glowing
tint
of
the
albion
rose
pales
before
the
withering
influence
of
late
hours
and
they
are
naturally
a
fine
people
and
possess
capabilities
and
talents
which
when
improved
by
cultivation
will
render
them
second
to
no
people
in
the
world
and
that
period
is
not
far
distant
idiots
and
mad
people
are
so
seldom
met
with
among
natives
of
the
colony
that
not
one
of
this
description
of
unfortunates
has
ever
come
under
my
own
immediate
observation
to
the
benevolent
philanthropist
whose
heart
has
bled
over
the
misery
and
pauperism
of
the
lower
classes
in
great
britain
the
almost
entire
absence
of
mendicity
from
canada
would
be
highly
gratifying
canada
has
few
if
any
native
beggars
her
objects
of
charity
are
generally
imported
from
the
mother
country
and
these
are
never
suffered
to
want
food
or
clothing
the
canadians
are
a
truly
charitable
people
no
person
in
distress
is
driven
with
harsh
and
cruel
language
from
their
doors
they
not
only
generously
relieve
the
wants
of
suffering
strangers
cast
upon
their
bounty
but
they
nurse
them
in
sickness
and
use
every
means
in
their
power
to
procure
them
employment
the
number
of
orphan
children
yearly
adopted
by
wealthy
canadians
and
treated
in
every
respect
as
their
own
is
almost
incredible
it
is
a
glorious
country
for
the
labouring
classes
for
while
blessed
with
health
they
are
always
certain
of
employment
and
certain
also
to
derive
from
it
ample
means
of
support
for
their
families
an
industrious
man
in
a
few
years
is
able
to
purchase
from
his
savings
a
homestead
of
his
own
and
in
process
of
time
becomes
one
of
the
most
important
and
prosperous
class
of
settlers
in
canada
her
free
and
independent
yeomen
who
form
the
bones
and
sinews
of
this
rising
country
and
from
among
whom
she
already
begins
to
draw
her
senators
while
their
educated
sons
become
the
aristocrats
of
the
rising
generation
it
has
often
been
remarked
to
me
by
people
long
resident
in
the
colony
that
those
who
come
to
the
country
destitute
of
means
but
able
and
willing
to
work
invariably
improve
their
condition
and
become
independent
while
the
gentleman
who
brings
out
with
him
a
small
capital
is
too
often
tricked
and
cheated
out
of
his
property
and
drawn
into
rash
and
dangerous
speculations
which
terminate
in
his
ruin
his
children
neglected
and
uneducated
yet
brought
up
with
ideas
far
beyond
their
means
and
suffered
to
waste
their
time
in
idleness
seldom
take
to
work
and
not
unfrequently
sink
down
to
the
lowest
class
but
i
have
dwelt
long
enough
upon
these
serious
subjects
and
i
will
leave
my
husband
who
is
better
qualified
than
myself
to
give
a
more
accurate
account
of
the
country
while
i
turn
to
matters
of
a
lighter
and
a
livelier
cast
it
was
towards
the
close
of
the
summer
of
which
had
been
unusually
cold
and
wet
for
canada
while
moodie
was
absent
at
d
inspecting
a
portion
of
his
government
grant
of
land
that
i
was
startled
one
night
just
before
retiring
to
rest
by
the
sudden
firing
of
guns
in
our
near
vicinity
accompanied
by
shouts
and
yells
the
braying
of
horns
the
beating
of
drums
and
the
barking
of
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
i
never
heard
a
more
stunning
uproar
of
discordant
and
hideous
sounds
what
could
it
all
mean
the
as
much
alarmed
as
myself
opened
the
door
and
listened
the
goodness
defend
us
she
exclaimed
quickly
closing
it
and
drawing
a
bolt
seldom
used
we
shall
be
murdered
the
yankees
must
have
taken
canada
and
are
marching
nonsense
that
can
not
be
it
besides
they
would
never
leave
the
main
road
to
attack
a
poor
place
like
this
yet
the
noise
is
very
near
hark
they
are
firing
again
bring
me
the
hammer
and
some
nails
and
let
us
secure
the
the
next
moment
i
laughed
at
my
folly
in
attempting
to
secure
a
log
hut
when
the
application
of
a
match
to
its
rotten
walls
would
consume
it
in
a
few
minutes
still
as
the
noise
increased
i
was
really
frightened
my
servant
who
was
irish
for
my
scotch
girl
bell
had
taken
to
herself
a
husband
and
i
had
been
obliged
to
hire
another
in
her
place
who
had
only
been
a
few
days
in
the
country
began
to
cry
and
wring
her
hands
and
lament
her
hard
fate
in
coming
to
canada
just
at
this
critical
moment
when
we
were
both
of
an
arrant
cowardice
which
would
have
shamed
a
canadian
child
of
six
years
old
o
tapped
at
the
door
and
although
generally
a
most
unwelcome
visitor
from
her
gossiping
mischievous
propensities
i
gladly
let
her
in
do
tell
me
i
cried
the
meaning
of
this
strange
uproar
oh
is
nothing
she
replied
laughing
you
and
mary
look
as
white
as
a
sheet
but
you
need
not
be
alarmed
a
set
of
wild
fellows
have
met
to
charivari
old
satan
who
has
married
his
fourth
wife
a
young
gal
of
sixteen
i
should
not
wonder
if
some
mischief
happens
among
them
for
they
are
a
bad
set
made
up
of
all
the
idle
loafers
about
port
h
and
c
what
is
a
charivari
said
i
do
pray
enlighten
have
you
been
nine
months
in
canada
and
ask
that
question
why
i
thought
you
knew
everything
well
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
the
charivari
is
a
custom
that
the
canadians
got
from
the
french
in
the
lower
province
and
a
queer
custom
it
is
when
an
old
man
marries
a
young
wife
or
an
old
woman
a
young
husband
or
two
old
people
who
ought
to
be
thinking
of
their
graves
enter
for
the
second
or
third
time
into
the
holy
estate
of
wedlock
as
the
priest
calls
it
all
the
idle
young
fellows
in
the
neighborhood
meet
together
to
charivari
them
for
this
purpose
they
disguise
themselves
blackening
their
faces
putting
their
clothes
on
hind
part
before
and
wearing
horrible
masks
with
grotesque
caps
on
their
head
adorned
with
cocks
feathers
and
bells
they
then
form
in
a
regular
body
and
proceed
to
the
bridegroom
house
to
the
sound
of
tin
kettles
horns
and
drums
cracked
fiddles
and
all
the
discordant
instruments
they
can
collect
together
thus
equipped
they
surround
the
house
where
the
wedding
is
held
just
at
the
hour
when
the
happy
couple
are
supposed
to
be
about
to
retire
to
rest
beating
upon
the
door
with
clubs
and
staves
and
demanding
of
the
bridegroom
admittance
to
drink
the
bride
health
or
in
lieu
there
of
to
receive
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
treat
the
band
at
the
nearest
tavern
if
the
bridegroom
refuses
to
appear
and
grant
their
request
they
commence
the
horrible
din
you
hear
firing
guns
charged
with
peas
against
the
doors
and
windows
rattling
old
pots
and
kettles
and
abusing
him
for
his
stinginess
in
no
measured
terms
sometimes
they
break
open
the
doors
and
seize
upon
the
bridegroom
and
he
may
esteem
himself
a
very
fortunate
man
under
such
circumstances
if
he
escapes
being
ridden
upon
a
rail
tarred
and
feathered
and
otherwise
maltreated
i
have
known
many
fatal
accidents
arise
out
of
an
imprudent
refusal
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
assailants
people
have
even
lost
their
lives
in
the
fray
and
i
think
the
government
should
interfere
and
put
down
these
riotous
meetings
surely
it
is
very
hard
that
an
old
man
can
not
marry
a
young
gal
if
she
is
willing
to
take
him
without
asking
the
leave
of
such
a
rabble
as
that
what
right
have
they
to
interfere
with
his
private
affairs
what
indeed
said
i
feeling
a
truly
british
indignation
at
such
a
lawless
infringement
upon
the
natural
rights
of
man
i
remember
continued
o
who
had
got
fairly
started
upon
a
favorite
subject
a
scene
of
this
kind
that
was
acted
two
years
ago
at
when
old
p
took
his
third
wife
he
was
a
very
rich
storekeeper
and
had
made
during
the
war
a
great
deal
of
money
he
felt
lonely
in
his
old
age
and
married
a
young
handsome
widow
to
enliven
his
house
the
lads
in
the
village
were
determined
to
make
him
pay
for
his
frolic
this
got
wind
and
p
was
advised
to
spend
the
honeymoon
in
toronto
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
that
was
not
going
to
be
frightened
from
his
comfortable
home
by
the
threats
of
a
few
wild
boys
in
the
morning
he
was
married
at
the
church
and
spent
the
day
at
home
where
he
entertained
a
large
party
of
his
own
and
the
bride
friends
during
the
evening
all
the
idle
chaps
in
the
town
collected
round
the
house
headed
by
a
mad
young
bookseller
who
had
offered
himself
for
their
captain
and
in
the
usual
forms
demanded
a
sight
of
the
bride
and
liquor
to
drink
her
health
they
were
very
received
by
p
who
sent
a
friend
down
to
them
to
bid
them
welcome
and
to
inquire
on
what
terms
they
would
consent
to
let
him
off
and
disperse
the
captain
of
the
band
demanded
sixty
dollars
as
he
p
could
well
afford
to
pay
it
too
much
my
fine
fellows
cried
p
from
the
open
window
and
i
will
send
you
down
a
cheque
upon
the
bank
of
montreal
for
the
money
thirty
thirty
old
boy
roared
a
hundred
voices
wife
worth
that
down
with
the
cash
and
we
will
give
you
three
cheers
and
three
times
three
for
the
bride
and
leave
you
to
sleep
in
peace
if
you
hang
back
we
will
raise
such
a
about
your
ears
that
you
sha
know
that
your
wife
your
own
for
a
month
to
come
give
you
remonstrated
the
bridegroom
not
the
least
alarmed
at
their
threats
and
laughing
all
the
time
in
his
sleeve
not
one
copper
less
here
they
gave
him
such
a
salute
of
diabolical
sounds
that
he
ran
from
the
window
with
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
his
friend
came
down
stairs
to
the
verandah
and
gave
them
the
sum
they
required
they
did
not
expect
that
the
old
man
would
have
been
so
liberal
and
they
gave
him
the
hip
hip
hurrah
in
fine
style
and
marched
off
the
finish
the
night
and
spend
the
money
at
the
and
do
people
allow
themselves
to
be
bullied
out
of
their
property
by
such
ruffians
ah
my
dear
is
the
custom
of
the
country
and
is
not
so
easy
to
put
it
down
but
i
can
tell
you
that
a
charivari
is
not
always
a
joke
there
was
another
affair
that
happened
just
before
you
came
to
the
place
that
occasioned
no
small
talk
in
the
neighbourhood
and
well
it
might
for
it
was
a
most
disgraceful
piece
of
business
and
attended
with
very
serious
consequences
some
of
the
charivari
party
had
to
fly
or
they
might
have
ended
their
days
in
the
penitentiary
there
was
runaway
nigger
from
the
states
came
to
the
village
and
set
up
a
barber
poll
and
settled
among
us
i
am
no
friend
to
the
blacks
but
really
tom
smith
was
such
a
quiet
fellow
and
so
civil
and
obliging
that
he
soon
got
a
good
business
he
was
clever
too
and
cleaned
old
clothes
until
they
looked
almost
as
good
as
new
well
after
a
time
he
persuaded
a
white
girl
to
marry
him
she
was
not
a
irish
woman
and
i
ca
think
what
bewitched
the
creature
to
take
him
her
marriage
with
the
black
man
created
a
great
sensation
in
the
town
all
the
young
fellows
were
indignant
at
his
presumption
and
her
folly
and
they
determined
to
give
them
the
charivari
in
fine
style
and
punish
them
both
for
the
insult
they
had
put
upon
the
place
some
of
the
young
gentlemen
in
the
town
joined
in
the
frolic
they
went
so
far
as
to
enter
the
house
drag
the
poor
nigger
from
his
bed
and
in
spite
of
his
shrieks
for
mercy
they
hurried
him
out
into
the
cold
air
for
it
was
winter
and
almost
naked
as
he
was
rode
him
upon
a
rail
and
so
him
that
he
died
under
their
hands
they
left
the
body
when
they
found
what
had
happened
and
fled
the
ringleaders
escaped
across
the
lake
to
the
other
side
and
those
who
remained
could
not
be
sufficiently
identified
to
bring
them
to
trial
the
affair
was
hushed
up
but
it
gave
great
uneasiness
to
several
respectable
families
whose
sons
were
in
the
good
heavens
are
such
things
permitted
in
a
christian
country
but
scenes
like
these
must
be
of
rare
occurrence
they
are
more
common
than
you
imagine
a
man
was
killed
up
at
w
the
other
day
and
two
others
dangerously
wounded
at
a
charivari
the
bridegroom
was
a
man
in
middle
life
a
desperately
resolute
and
passionate
man
and
he
swore
that
if
such
dared
to
interfere
with
him
he
would
shoot
at
them
with
as
little
compunction
as
he
would
at
so
many
crows
his
threats
only
increased
the
mischievous
determination
of
the
mob
to
torment
him
and
when
he
refused
to
admit
their
deputation
or
even
to
give
them
a
portion
of
the
wedding
cheer
they
determined
to
frighten
him
into
compliance
by
firing
several
guns
loaded
with
peas
at
his
door
their
salute
was
returned
from
the
chamber
windows
by
the
discharge
of
a
gun
loaded
with
the
crowd
gave
back
with
a
tremendous
yell
their
leader
was
shot
through
the
heart
and
two
of
the
foremost
in
the
scuffle
dangerously
wounded
they
vowed
they
would
set
fire
to
the
house
but
the
bridegroom
boldly
stepped
to
the
window
and
told
them
to
try
it
and
before
they
could
light
a
torch
he
would
fire
among
them
again
as
his
gun
was
reloaded
and
he
would
discharge
it
at
them
as
long
as
one
of
them
dared
to
remain
on
his
premises
they
cleared
off
but
though
a
was
not
punished
for
the
as
it
was
called
he
became
a
marked
man
and
lately
left
the
colony
to
settle
in
the
united
states
why
moodie
you
look
quite
serious
i
can
however
tell
you
a
less
dismal
tale
a
charivari
would
seldom
be
attended
with
bad
consequences
if
people
would
take
it
as
a
joke
and
join
in
the
a
very
dignified
proceeding
for
a
bride
and
bridegroom
to
make
themselves
the
of
such
people
oh
but
custom
reconciles
us
to
everything
and
is
better
to
give
up
a
little
of
our
pride
than
endanger
the
lives
of
our
i
have
been
told
a
story
of
a
lady
in
the
lower
province
who
took
for
her
second
husband
a
young
fellow
who
as
far
as
his
age
was
concerned
might
have
been
her
son
the
mob
surrounded
her
house
at
night
carrying
her
effigy
in
an
open
coffin
supported
by
six
young
lads
with
white
favours
in
their
hats
and
they
buried
the
poor
bride
amid
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
usual
accompaniments
just
opposite
her
windows
the
widow
was
highly
amused
by
the
whole
of
their
proceedings
but
she
wisely
let
them
have
their
own
way
she
lived
in
a
strong
stone
house
and
she
barred
the
doors
and
closed
the
iron
shutters
and
set
them
at
defiance
long
as
she
enjoyed
her
health
she
said
were
welcome
to
bury
her
in
effigy
as
often
as
they
pleased
she
was
really
glad
to
be
able
to
afford
amusement
to
so
many
people
night
after
night
during
the
whole
of
that
winter
the
same
party
beset
her
house
with
their
diabolical
music
but
she
only
laughed
at
them
the
leader
of
the
mob
was
a
young
lawyer
from
these
parts
a
sad
mischievous
fellow
the
widow
became
aware
of
this
and
she
invited
him
one
evening
to
take
tea
with
a
small
party
at
her
house
he
accepted
the
invitation
was
charmed
with
her
hearty
and
hospitable
welcome
and
soon
found
himself
quite
at
home
but
only
think
how
ashamed
he
must
have
felt
when
the
same
commenced
at
the
usual
hour
in
front
of
the
lady
house
said
r
smiling
to
her
husband
come
our
friends
really
k
they
amuse
us
so
much
of
an
evening
that
i
should
feel
quite
dull
without
them
from
that
hour
the
charivari
ceased
and
the
old
lady
was
left
to
enjoy
the
society
of
her
young
husband
in
quiet
i
assure
you
m
that
the
charivari
often
deters
old
people
from
making
disgraceful
marriages
so
that
it
is
not
wholly
without
its
a
few
days
after
the
charivari
affair
d
stepped
in
to
see
me
she
was
an
american
a
very
respectable
old
lady
who
resided
in
a
handsome
on
the
main
road
i
was
at
dinner
the
in
the
meanwhile
nursing
my
child
at
a
distance
d
sat
looking
at
me
very
seriously
until
i
concluded
my
meal
her
dinner
having
been
accomplished
several
hours
before
when
i
had
finished
the
girl
give
me
the
child
and
then
removed
the
into
an
outer
room
you
do
eat
with
your
helps
said
my
visitor
is
not
that
something
like
pride
it
is
custom
said
i
we
were
not
used
to
do
so
at
home
and
i
think
that
keeping
a
separate
table
is
more
comfortable
for
both
are
you
not
both
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
the
rich
and
the
poor
meet
together
and
the
lord
is
the
maker
of
them
true
your
quotation
is
just
and
i
assent
to
it
with
all
my
heart
there
is
no
difference
in
the
flesh
and
blood
but
education
makes
a
difference
in
the
mind
and
manners
and
till
these
can
assimilate
it
is
better
to
keep
them
ah
you
are
not
a
good
christian
moodie
the
lord
thought
more
of
the
poor
than
he
did
of
the
rich
and
he
obtained
more
followers
from
among
them
now
always
take
our
meals
with
our
presently
after
while
talking
over
the
affairs
of
our
households
i
happened
to
say
that
the
cow
we
had
bought
of
mollineux
had
turned
out
extremely
well
and
gave
a
great
deal
of
milk
that
man
lived
with
us
several
years
she
said
he
was
an
excellent
servant
and
d
paid
him
his
wages
in
land
the
farm
he
now
occupies
formed
a
part
of
our
grant
but
for
all
his
good
conduct
i
never
could
abide
him
for
being
a
indeed
is
he
not
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
the
rest
the
colour
rose
into
d
sallow
face
and
she
answered
with
much
warmth
what
do
you
mean
to
compare
with
a
not
exactly
but
after
all
the
colour
makes
the
only
difference
between
him
and
uneducated
men
of
the
same
mrs
moodie
she
exclaimed
holding
up
her
hands
in
pious
horror
they
are
the
children
of
the
devil
god
never
condescended
to
make
a
such
an
idea
is
an
impeachment
of
the
power
and
majesty
of
the
almighty
how
can
you
believe
such
an
ignorant
fable
well
then
said
my
monitress
in
high
dudgeon
if
the
devil
did
not
make
them
they
are
descended
from
but
all
cain
posterity
perished
in
the
my
visitor
was
puzzled
the
african
race
it
is
generally
believed
are
the
descendants
of
ham
and
to
many
of
their
tribes
the
curse
pronounced
against
him
seems
to
cling
to
be
the
servant
of
servants
is
bad
enough
without
our
making
their
condition
worse
by
our
cruel
persecutions
christ
came
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost
and
in
proof
of
this
inestimable
promise
he
did
not
reject
the
ethiopian
eunuch
who
was
baptised
by
philip
and
who
was
doubtless
as
black
as
the
rest
of
his
people
do
you
not
admit
mollineux
to
your
table
with
your
other
helps
mercy
sake
do
you
think
that
i
would
sit
down
at
the
same
table
with
a
nigger
my
helps
would
leave
the
house
if
i
dared
to
put
such
an
affront
upon
them
sit
down
with
a
dirty
black
indeed
do
you
think
d
that
there
will
be
any
negroes
in
heaven
certainly
not
or
i
for
one
would
never
wish
to
go
there
and
out
of
the
house
she
sallied
in
high
disdain
yet
this
was
the
woman
who
had
given
me
such
a
plausible
lecture
on
pride
alas
for
our
fallen
nature
which
is
more
subversive
of
peace
and
christian
fellowship
ignorance
of
our
own
characters
or
the
characters
of
others
our
departure
for
the
woods
became
now
a
frequent
theme
of
conversation
my
husband
had
just
returned
from
an
exploring
expedition
to
the
backwoods
and
was
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
removing
thither
the
only
thing
i
listened
to
in
their
praise
with
any
degree
of
interest
was
a
lively
song
which
he
had
written
during
his
brief
sojourn
at

wealth
which
no

we
will
chase
the

with
a
song

at
grey

of

let
this
be
our
cry

the

well
stranger
here
you
are
all
safe
and
sound
you
now
on
shore
methinks
you
look
aghast
as
if
you
made
some
slight
mistake
and
found
a
land
you
liked
not
think
not
of
the
past
your
are
cut
the
mystic
chain
that
bound
you
to
your
fair
and
smiling
shore
is
sever
now
indeed
is
now
in
vain
to
sigh
for
joys
that
can
return
no
more
emigration
however
necessary
as
the
obvious
means
of
providing
for
the
increasing
population
of
and
countries
is
indeed
a
very
serious
matter
to
the
individual
emigrant
and
his
family
he
is
thrown
adrift
as
it
were
on
a
troubled
ocean
the
winds
and
currents
of
which
are
unknown
to
him
his
past
experience
and
his
judgment
founded
on
experience
will
be
useless
to
him
in
this
new
sphere
of
action
in
an
old
country
where
generation
after
generation
inhabits
the
same
spot
the
mental
dispositions
and
prejudices
of
our
ancestors
become
in
a
manner
hereditary
and
descend
to
their
children
with
their
possessions
in
a
new
colony
on
the
contrary
the
habits
and
associations
of
the
emigrant
having
been
broken
up
for
ever
he
is
suddenly
thrown
on
his
own
internal
resources
and
compelled
to
act
and
decide
at
once
not
unfrequently
under
pain
of
misery
or
starvation
he
is
surrounded
with
dangers
often
without
the
ordinary
means
which
and
prudence
suggest
of
avoiding
them
because
the
on
which
these
common
qualities
are
founded
is
wanting
separated
for
ever
from
those
friends
who
in
his
native
country
would
advise
or
assist
him
in
his
first
efforts
and
surrounded
by
people
who
have
an
interest
in
misleading
and
imposing
upon
him
experience
shows
that
no
amount
of
natural
sagacity
or
prudence
founded
on
experience
in
other
countries
will
be
an
effectual
safeguard
against
deception
and
erroneous
conclusions
it
is
a
fact
worthy
of
observation
that
among
emigrants
possessing
the
qualities
of
industry
and
perseverance
so
essential
to
success
in
all
countries
those
who
possess
the
smallest
share
of
original
talent
and
imagination
and
the
least
of
a
speculative
turn
of
mind
are
usually
the
most
successful
they
follow
the
beaten
track
and
prosper
however
humbling
this
reflection
may
be
to
human
vanity
it
should
operate
as
a
salutary
check
on
presumption
and
hasty
conclusions
after
a
residence
of
sixteen
years
in
canada
during
which
my
young
and
helpless
family
have
been
exposed
to
many
privations
while
we
toiled
incessantly
and
continued
to
hope
even
against
hope
these
reflections
naturally
occur
to
our
minds
not
only
as
the
view
of
the
subject
but
as
the
fruit
of
long
and
experience
after
all
this
long
probation
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
i
find
myself
brought
back
in
circumstances
nearly
to
the
point
from
whence
i
started
and
am
compelled
to
admit
that
had
i
only
followed
my
own
unassisted
judgment
when
i
arrived
with
my
wife
and
child
in
canada
and
quietly
settled
down
on
the
cleared
farm
i
had
purchased
in
a
neighbourhood
and
with
the
aid
of
the
means
i
then
possessed
i
should
now
in
all
probability
have
been
in
easy
if
not
in
affluent
circumstances
native
canadians
like
yankees
will
make
money
where
people
from
the
old
country
would
almost
starve
their
intimate
knowledge
of
the
country
and
of
the
circumstances
of
the
inhabitants
enables
them
to
turn
their
money
to
great
advantage
and
i
must
add
that
few
people
from
the
old
country
however
avaricious
can
bring
themselves
to
stoop
to
the
unscrupulous
means
of
acquiring
property
which
are
too
commonly
resorted
to
in
this
country
these
reflections
are
a
rather
serious
commencement
of
a
sketch
which
was
intended
to
be
of
a
more
lively
description
one
of
my
chief
objects
in
writing
this
chapter
being
to
afford
a
connecting
link
between
my
wife
sketches
and
to
account
for
some
circumstances
connected
with
our
situation
which
otherwise
would
be
unintelligible
to
the
reader
before
emigrating
to
canada
i
had
been
settled
as
a
bachelor
in
south
africa
for
about
twelve
years
i
use
the
word
settled
for
want
of
a
better
term
for
a
bachelor
can
never
properly
be
said
to
be
settled
he
has
no
object
in
life
no
aim
he
is
like
a
knife
without
a
blade
or
a
gun
without
a
barrel
he
is
always
in
the
way
and
nobody
cares
for
him
if
he
work
on
a
farm
as
i
did
for
i
never
could
look
on
while
others
were
working
without
lending
a
hand
he
works
merely
for
the
sake
of
work
he
benefits
nobody
by
his
exertions
not
even
himself
for
he
is
restless
and
anxious
has
a
hundred
indescribable
ailments
which
no
one
but
himself
can
understand
and
for
want
of
the
legitimate
cares
and
anxieties
connected
with
a
family
he
is
full
of
cares
and
anxieties
of
his
own
creating
in
short
he
is
in
a
false
position
as
every
man
must
be
who
presumes
to
live
alone
when
he
can
do
better
this
was
my
case
in
south
africa
i
had
plenty
of
land
and
of
all
the
common
necessaries
of
life
but
i
lived
for
years
without
companionship
for
my
nearest
english
neighbour
was
miles
off
i
hunted
the
wild
animals
of
the
country
and
had
plenty
of
books
to
read
but
from
talking
broken
dutch
for
months
together
i
almost
forgot
how
to
speak
my
own
language
correctly
my
very
ideas
for
i
had
not
entirely
lost
the
reflecting
faculty
became
confused
and
limited
for
want
of
intellectual
companions
to
strike
out
new
lights
and
form
new
combinations
in
the
regions
of
thought
clearly
showing
that
man
was
not
intended
to
live
alone
getting
at
length
tired
of
this
solitary
and
unproductive
life
i
started
for
england
with
the
resolution
of
placing
my
domestic
matters
on
a
more
comfortable
footing
by
a
happy
accident
at
the
house
of
a
literary
friend
in
london
i
became
acquainted
with
one
to
whose
cultivated
mind
devoted
affections
and
untiring
energy
of
character
i
have
been
chiefly
indebted
for
many
happy
hours
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
as
well
as
for
much
of
that
hope
and
firm
reliance
upon
providence
which
have
enabled
me
to
bear
up
against
overwhelming
misfortunes
i
need
not
here
repeat
what
has
been
already
stated
respecting
the
motives
which
induced
us
to
emigrate
to
canada
i
shall
merely
observe
that
when
i
left
south
africa
it
was
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
that
colony
where
i
had
a
fine
property
to
which
i
was
attached
in
no
ordinary
degree
on
account
of
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
and
delightful
climate
however
moodie
somehow
or
other
had
imbibed
an
invincible
dislike
to
that
colony
for
some
of
the
very
reasons
that
i
liked
it
myself
the
wild
animals
were
her
terror
and
she
fancied
that
every
wood
and
thicket
was
peopled
with
elephants
lions
and
tigers
and
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
take
a
walk
without
treading
on
dangerous
snakes
in
the
grass
unfortunately
she
had
my
own
book
on
south
africa
to
quote
triumphantly
in
confirmation
of
her
vague
notions
of
danger
and
in
my
anxiety
to
remove
these
exaggerated
impressions
i
would
fain
have
retracted
my
own
statements
of
the
escapes
i
had
made
in
conflicts
with
wild
animals
respecting
which
the
slightest
insinuation
of
doubt
from
another
party
would
have
excited
my
utmost
indignation
in
truth
before
i
became
familiarised
with
such
danger
i
had
myself
entertained
similar
notions
and
my
only
wonder
in
reading
such
narratives
before
leaving
my
own
country
was
how
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
managed
to
attend
to
their
ordinary
business
in
the
midst
of
such
accumulated
dangers
and
annoyances
fortunately
these
escapes
are
of
rare
occurrence
but
travellers
and
like
cooks
have
to
collect
dishes
from
far
and
near
the
better
to
please
the
palates
of
their
patrons
so
it
was
with
my
south
african
adventures
i
threw
myself
in
the
way
of
danger
from
the
love
of
strong
excitement
and
i
collected
all
my
adventures
together
and
related
them
in
pure
simplicity
without
very
particularly
informing
the
reader
over
what
space
of
time
or
place
my
narrative
extended
or
telling
him
that
i
could
easily
have
kept
out
of
harm
way
had
i
felt
so
inclined
all
these
arguments
however
had
little
influence
on
my
good
wife
for
i
could
not
deny
that
i
had
seen
such
animals
in
abundance
in
south
africa
and
she
thought
she
should
never
be
safe
among
such
neighbours
at
last
between
my
wife
fear
of
the
wild
animals
of
africa
and
a
certain
love
of
novelty
which
formed
a
part
of
my
own
character
i
made
up
my
mind
as
they
write
on
stray
letters
in
the
to
try
so
here
we
are
just
arrived
in
the
village
of
c
situated
on
the
northern
shore
of
lake
ontario
moodie
has
already
stated
that
we
procured
lodgings
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
village
of
c
kept
by
s
a
truly
excellent
and
obliging
american
the
british
traveller
is
not
a
little
struck
and
in
many
instances
disgusted
with
a
certain
air
of
indifference
in
the
manners
of
such
persons
in
canada
which
is
accompanied
with
a
tone
of
equality
and
familiarity
exceedingly
unlike
the
limber
and
oily
obsequiousness
of
in
england
i
confess
i
felt
at
the
time
not
a
little
annoyed
with
s
manner
and
apparent
coolness
and
indifference
when
he
told
us
he
had
no
spare
room
in
his
house
to
accommodate
our
party
we
endeavoured
to
procure
lodgings
at
another
tavern
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
but
soon
learned
that
in
consequence
of
the
arrival
of
an
unusual
number
of
immigrants
all
the
taverns
in
the
village
were
already
filled
to
overflowing
we
returned
to
s
and
after
some
further
conversation
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
kind
of
liking
to
us
and
became
more
complaisant
in
his
manner
until
our
arrangement
with
tom
wilson
as
already
related
relieved
us
from
further
difficulty
i
perfectly
understand
the
cause
of
this
apparent
indifference
on
the
part
of
our
host
of
all
people
englishmen
when
abroad
are
the
most
addicted
to
the
practice
of
giving
themselves
arrogant
airs
towards
those
persons
whom
they
look
upon
in
the
light
of
dependents
on
their
bounty
and
they
forget
that
an
american
holds
a
very
different
position
in
society
from
one
of
the
same
calling
in
england
the
manners
and
circumstances
of
new
countries
are
utterly
opposed
to
anything
like
pretension
in
any
class
of
society
and
our
worthy
host
and
his
excellent
wife
who
had
both
held
a
respectable
position
in
the
society
of
the
united
states
had
often
been
deeply
wounded
in
their
feelings
by
the
disgusting
and
vulgar
arrogance
of
english
and
as
they
are
called
knowing
from
experience
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
what
can
not
be
cured
must
be
endured
we
were
particularly
civil
to
s
and
it
was
astonishing
how
quickly
his
manners
thawed
we
had
not
been
long
in
the
house
before
we
were
witnesses
of
so
many
examples
of
the
purest
benevolence
exhibited
by
s
and
his
amiable
family
that
it
was
impossible
to
regard
them
with
any
feeling
but
that
of
warm
regard
and
esteem
s
was
in
truth
a
fellow
whatever
he
did
seemed
so
much
a
matter
of
habit
that
the
idea
of
selfish
design
or
ostentation
was
utterly
excluded
from
the
mind
i
could
relate
several
instances
of
the
disinterested
benevolence
of
this
i
shall
just
mention
one
which
came
under
my
own
observation
while
i
lived
near
c
i
had
frequently
met
a
young
englishman
of
the
name
of
m
at
s
tavern
his
easy
and
elegant
manners
and
whole
deportment
showed
that
he
had
habitually
lived
in
what
is
called
the
best
society
he
had
emigrated
to
canada
with
or
pounds
had
bought
horses
run
races
entertained
many
of
the
wealthy
people
of
toronto
or
york
as
it
was
then
called
and
had
done
a
number
of
other
exceedingly
foolish
things
of
course
his
money
was
soon
absorbed
by
the
thirsty
canadians
and
he
became
deeply
involved
in
debt
m
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
at
s
tavern
and
owed
him
or
pounds
at
length
he
was
arrested
for
debt
by
some
other
party
was
sent
to
the
district
gaol
which
was
nearly
two
miles
from
c
and
was
compelled
at
first
to
subsist
on
the
gaol
allowance
what
greatly
aggravated
the
misfortunes
of
poor
m
a
man
without
suspicion
or
guile
was
a
bitter
disappointment
in
another
quarter
he
had
an
uncle
in
england
who
was
very
rich
and
who
intended
to
leave
him
all
his
property
some
kind
friend
to
whom
m
had
confided
his
expectations
wrote
to
england
informing
the
old
man
of
his
nephew
extravagance
and
hopes
the
uncle
cast
him
off
and
left
his
property
when
he
died
to
another
relative
as
soon
as
the
heard
of
the
poor
imprisonment
he
immediately
went
to
see
him
and
though
he
had
not
the
slightest
hope
of
ever
being
paid
one
farthing
of
his
claim
s
for
many
months
that
poor
m
lay
in
gaol
continued
to
send
him
an
excellent
dinner
every
day
from
his
tavern
to
which
he
always
added
a
bottle
of
wine
for
as
s
remarked
poor
m
i
guess
is
accustomed
to
live
as
soon
as
s
found
that
we
did
not
belong
to
that
class
of
people
who
fancy
they
exalt
themselves
by
insulting
others
there
were
no
bounds
to
the
obligingness
of
his
disposition
as
i
had
informed
him
that
i
wished
to
buy
a
cleared
farm
near
lake
ontario
he
drove
me
out
every
day
in
all
directions
and
wherever
he
thought
farms
were
to
be
had
cheap
before
proceeding
further
in
my
account
of
the
inhabitants
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
appearance
of
the
village
and
the
surrounding
country
of
course
from
the
existence
of
a
boundless
forest
only
partially
cleared
there
is
a
great
sameness
and
uniformity
in
canadian
scenery
we
had
a
stormy
passage
from
kingston
to
c
and
the
wind
being
directly
ahead
the
plunging
of
the
between
the
sharp
seas
of
lake
ontario
produced
a
motion
which
was
decidedly
unconstitutional
and
for
the
first
time
since
we
left
england
we
experienced
a
sensation
which
strongly
reminded
us
of
the
general
appearance
of
the
coast
from
the
lake
was
somewhat
uninviting
the
land
appeared
to
be
covered
everywhere
with
the
dense
unbroken
forest
and
though
there
were
some
gently
sloping
hills
and
slight
elevations
showing
the
margin
of
extensive
clearings
there
was
a
general
want
of
a
background
of
high
hills
or
mountains
which
imparts
so
much
interest
to
the
scenery
of
every
country
on
reaching
c
however
we
found
that
we
had
been
much
deceived
as
to
the
features
of
the
country
when
viewed
at
a
less
distance
immediately
on
the
shores
of
the
great
lake
the
land
is
generally
flat
for
two
or
three
miles
inland
and
as
the
farms
are
there
measured
out
in
long
narrow
strips
a
mile
and
a
quarter
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
the
back
parts
of
the
lots
which
are
reserved
for
firewood
are
only
visible
at
a
distance
this
narrow
belt
of
the
primeval
forest
which
runs
along
the
rear
of
all
the
lots
in
the
first
line
of
settlements
or
concession
as
it
is
here
called
necessarily
conceals
the
houses
and
clearings
of
the
next
concession
unless
the
land
beyond
rises
into
hills
this
arrangement
however
convenient
tends
greatly
to
mar
the
beauty
of
canadian
scenery
the
unvarying
monotony
of
and
quadrangular
enclosures
occasions
a
tiresome
uniformity
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
which
is
increased
by
the
almost
total
absence
of
those
little
graceful
ornaments
in
detail
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
homesteads
which
give
such
a
charm
to
english
rural
scenery
the
day
after
our
arrival
we
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
town
or
rather
village
of
c
it
then
consisted
chiefly
of
one
long
street
parallel
with
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
the
houses
with
very
few
exceptions
were
built
of
wood
but
they
were
all
finished
and
painted
with
such
a
degree
of
neatness
that
their
appearance
was
showy
and
in
some
instances
elegant
from
the
symmetry
of
their
proportions
immediately
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
village
we
for
the
first
time
witnessed
the
operation
of
clearing
up
a
thick
the
soil
looked
black
and
rich
but
the
water
stood
in
pools
and
the
trunks
and
branches
of
the
cedars
were
leaning
in
all
directions
and
at
all
angles
with
their
thick
foliage
and
branches
intermingled
in
wild
confusion
the
roots
spread
along
the
uneven
surface
of
the
ground
so
thickly
that
they
seemed
to
form
a
vast
and
apparently
covered
the
greater
part
of
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
task
of
clearing
such
a
labyrinth
seemed
utterly
hopeless
my
heart
almost
sickened
at
the
prospect
of
clearing
such
land
and
i
was
greatly
confirmed
in
my
resolution
of
buying
a
farm
cleared
to
my
hand
the
clearing
process
however
in
this
unpromising
spot
was
going
on
vigorously
several
acres
had
been
chopped
down
and
the
fire
had
run
through
the
prostrate
trees
consuming
all
the
smaller
branches
and
foliage
and
leaving
the
trunks
and
ground
as
black
as
charcoal
could
make
them
among
this
vast
mass
of
ruins
four
or
five
men
were
toiling
with
yoke
of
oxen
the
trees
were
cut
into
manageable
lengths
and
were
then
dragged
by
the
oxen
together
so
that
they
could
be
thrown
up
into
large
to
burn
the
men
looked
with
their
bare
arms
hands
and
faces
begrimed
with
charcoal
more
like
negroes
than
white
men
and
were
we
like
some
shallow
people
to
compare
their
apparent
condition
with
that
of
the
negro
slaves
in
more
favoured
regions
we
should
be
disposed
to
consider
the
latter
the
happier
race
but
this
disgusting
work
was
the
work
of
freemen
and
energetic
fellows
who
feared
neither
man
nor
wild
beast
and
trusted
to
their
own
strong
arms
to
conquer
all
difficulties
while
they
could
discern
the
light
of
freedom
and
independence
glimmering
through
the
dark
woods
before
them
a
few
years
afterwards
i
visited
c
and
looked
about
for
the
dreadful
which
struck
such
a
chill
into
my
heart
and
destroyed
the
illusion
which
had
possessed
my
mind
of
the
beauty
of
the
canadian
woods
the
trees
were
gone
the
tangled
roots
were
gone
and
the
was
converted
into
a
fair
grassy
meadow
as
smooth
as
a
about
sixteen
years
after
my
first
visit
to
this
spot
i
saw
it
again
and
it
was
covered
with
stone
and
brick
houses
and
one
portion
of
it
was
occupied
by
a
large
manufactory
five
or
six
stories
high
with
and
all
the
machinery
for
working
up
the
wool
of
the
country
into
every
description
of
clothing
this
is
civilisation
this
is
freedom
the
sites
of
towns
and
villages
in
canada
are
never
selected
at
random
in
england
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
has
generally
led
to
the
gradual
formation
of
hamlets
villages
and
towns
in
many
instances
towns
have
grown
up
in
barbarous
ages
around
a
place
of
refuge
during
war
around
a
fortalice
or
castle
and
more
frequently
around
the
ford
over
a
river
where
the
detention
of
travellers
has
led
to
the
establishment
of
a
place
of
entertainment
a
or
carpenter
shop
a
village
or
town
never
grows
to
any
size
in
canada
without
a
saw
or
a
grist
mill
both
which
require
a
certain
amount
of
to
work
the
machinery
whenever
there
is
a
river
or
stream
available
for
such
purposes
and
the
surrounding
country
is
fertile
the
village
rapidly
rises
to
be
a
considerable
town
are
so
quickly
erected
and
the
materials
are
so
easily
procured
near
a
that
in
the
first
instance
no
other
description
of
houses
is
to
be
found
in
our
incipient
towns
but
as
the
town
increases
brick
and
stone
houses
rapidly
supplant
these
less
substantial
edifices
which
seldom
remain
good
for
more
than
thirty
or
forty
years
s
tavern
or
hotel
was
an
extensive
of
the
kind
common
in
the
country
all
the
lodgers
frequent
the
same
long
table
at
all
their
meals
at
one
end
of
which
the
landlord
generally
presides
s
however
usually
preferred
the
company
of
his
family
in
another
part
of
the
house
and
some
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
boarded
at
the
tavern
and
who
possessed
a
sufficiently
large
organ
of
voted
himself
into
the
post
of
honour
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
from
the
rest
of
the
company
this
happy
individual
is
generally
some
little
fellow
with
a
long
protruding
nose
some
gentleman
who
can
stretch
his
neck
and
backbone
almost
to
dislocation
and
who
has
a
prodigious
deal
of
talk
all
about
nothing
the
taverns
in
this
country
are
frequented
by
all
single
men
and
by
many
married
men

a

portion
of
the
population
of
the

take
all
their

at

to
save
both
expense
and
time
the
extraordinary
despatch
used
at
meals
in

united

has
often
been
mentioned
by
travellers
the
same
observation
equally
applies
to
canada
and
for
the
same
reason
wages
are
high
and
time
is
therefore
valuable
in
both
countries
and
as
one
clerk
is
waiting
in
the
shop
while
another
is
bolting
his
dinner
it
would
of
course
be
exceedingly
unkind
to
protract
unnecessarily
the
sufferings
of
the
hungry
expectant
no
one
possessing
any
bowels
of

could
act
so
cruelly
for
the

reason
every

is
expected
to
take
care

without
minding
his
neighbours
at
times
a
degree
of
compassion
is
extended
by
some
naturalised
old
countryman
towards
some
diffident
new
comer
by
offering
to
help
him
first
but
such
marks
of
consideration
except
to
ladies
to
whom
all
classes
in
canada
are
attentive
are
never
continued
a
bit
longer
than
is
thought
sufficient
for
becoming
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
country
soon
after
our
arrival
at
c
i
remember
asking
a
person
who
was
what
the
canadians
call
a
hickory
quaker
from
the
north
of
ireland
to
help
me
to
a
bit
of
very
nice
which
was
vanishing
alarmingly
fast
from
the
obadiah
very
considerately
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
my
repeated
entreaties
pretending
to
be
intently
occupied
with
his
own
plate
of
fish
then
transferring
the
remains
of
the
to
his
own
place
he
turned
round
to
me
with
the
most
innocent
face
imaginable
saying
very
coolly
i
beg
your
pardon
friend
did
you
speak
to
me
there
is
such
a
noise
at
the
table
i
can
not
hear
very
between
meals
there
is
considerable
of
drinking
among
the
idlers
about
the
tavern
of
the
various
ingenious
yankee
inventions
resorted
to
in
this
country
to
disturb
the
brain
in
the
evening
the
plot
thickens
and
a
number
of
young
and
men
drop
in
and
are
found
in
little
knots
in
the
different
public
rooms
the
practice
of
treating
is
almost
universal
in
this
country
and
though
friendly
and
sociable
in
its
way
is
the
fruitful
source
of
much
dissipation
it
is
almost
impossible
in
travelling
to
steer
clear
of
this
evil
habit
strangers
are
almost
invariably
drawn
into
it
in
the
course
of
business
the
town
of
c
being
the
point
where
a
large
number
of
emigrants
landed
on
their
way
to
the
backwoods
of
this
part
of
the
colony
it
became
for
a
time
a
place
of
great
resort
and
here
a
number
of
were
established
who
made
a
profitable
trade
of
buying
lands
from
private
individuals
or
at
the
government
sales
of
wild
land
and
selling
them
again
to
the
settlers
from
the
old
country
though
my
wife
had
some
near
relatives
settled
in
the
backwoods
about
forty
miles
inland
to
the
north
of
c
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
buy
a
cleared
farm
near
lake
ontario
if
i
could
get
one
to
my
mind
and
the
price
of
which
would
come
within
my
limited
means
a
number
of
the
recent
settlers
in
the
backwoods
among
whom
were
several
speculators
resorted
frequently
to
c
and
as
soon
as
a
new
batch
of
settlers
arrived
on
the
lake
shore
there
was
a
keen
contest
between
the
of
c
and
those
of
the
backwoods
to
draw
the
new
comer
into
their
nets
the
demand
created
by
the
continual
influx
of
immigrants
had
caused
a
rapid
increase
in
the
price
of
lands
particularly
of
wild
lands
and
the
grossest
imposition
was
often
practiced
by
these
people
who
made
enormous
profits
by
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
the
new
settlers
and
of
their
anxiety
to
settle
themselves
at
once
i
was
continually
cautioned
by
these
people
against
buying
a
farm
in
any
other
locality
than
the
particular
one
they
themselves
represented
as
most
eligible
and
their
rivals
were
always
represented
as
unprincipled
finding
these
accusations
to
be
mutual
i
naturally
felt
myself
constrained
to
believe
both
parties
to
be
alike
sometimes
i
got
hold
of
a
quiet
farmer
hoping
to
obtain
something
like
disinterested
advice
but
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
found
that
the
rage
for
speculation
and
trading
in
land
which
was
so
prevalent
in
all
the
great
thoroughfares
had
already
poisoned
their
minds
also
and
i
could
rarely
obtain
an
opinion
or
advice
which
was
utterly
free
from
they
generally
had
some
lot
of
land
to
sell
or
probably
they
would
like
to
have
a
new
comer
for
a
neighbour
in
the
hope
of
selling
him
a
span
of
horses
or
some
cows
at
a
higher
price
than
they
could
obtain
from
the
older
settlers
in
mentioning
this
unamiable
trait
in
the
character
of
the
farmers
near
c
i
by
no
means
intend
to
give
it
as
characteristic
of
the
farmers
in
general
it
is
properly
speaking
a
vice
produced
by
the
constant
influx
of
strangers
unacquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
country
which
tempts
the
farmers
to
take
advantage
of
their
ignorance

but

to

when
the
love

struck
its
roots
in
his

sordid
heart
each
impulse
chill
like
vampire
now
he
sucks

he
viler
grows

at

stretch
on

descend
strong

and
while
he
feebly
plucks
his
wretched
coverlet
he
gasps
for
breath
and
thinks
he
gathers
gold
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
gentleman
of
large
property
at
c
who
knowing
that
i
wished
to
purchase
a
farm
very
kindly
drove
me
out
to
several
lots
of
land
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
he
showed
me
seven
or
eight
very
eligible
lots
of
cleared
land
some
of
them
with
good
houses
and
orchards
but
somehow
or
other
on
inquiry
i
found
they
all
belonged
to
himself
and
moreover
the
prices
were
beyond
my
limited
means
for
one
farm
he
asked
pounds
for
another
pounds
and
so
on
after
inquiring
in
other
quarters
i
saw
i
had
no
chance
of
getting
a
farm
in
that
neighbourhood
for
the
price
i
could
afford
to
pay
down
which
was
only
about
pounds
after
satisfying
myself
as
to
this
fact
i
thought
it
the
wiser
course
at
once
to
undeceive
my
very
obliging
friend
whose
attentions
were
obviously
nicely
adjusted
to
the
estimate
he
had
formed
in
his
own
mind
of
my
pecuniary
resources
on
communicating
this
discouraging
fact
my
friend
countenance
instantly
assumed
a
cold
and
stony
expression
and
i
almost
expected
that
he
would
have
stopped
his
horses
and
set
me
down
to
walk
with
other
poor
men
as
may
well
be
supposed
i
was
never
afterwards
honoured
with
a
seat
in
his
carriage
he
saw
just
what
i
was
worth
and
i
saw
what
his
friendship
was
worth
and
thus
our
brief
acquaintance
terminated
having
thus
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
when
i
might
according
to
the
usual
way
of
the
world
have
sported
for
awhile
in
borrowed
plumage
and
rejoiced
in
the
reputation
of
being
in
more
prosperous
circumstances
without
fear
of
detection
i
determined
to
pursue
the
same
course
and
make
use
of
the
little
insight
i
had
obtained
into
the
ways
of
the
of
canada
to
procure
a
cleared
farm
on
more
reasonable
terms
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
land
speculators
to
sell
a
farm
to
a
respectable
settler
at
an
unusually
low
price
in
order
to
give
a
character
to
a
neighbourhood
where
they
hold
other
lands
and
thus
to
use
him
as
a
decoy
duck
for
friends
or
countrymen
there
was
very
noted
character
at
c
q
a
great
who
did
a
large
business
in
this
way
on
his
own
account
besides
getting
through
a
great
deal
of
dirty
work
for
other
more
respectable
speculators
who
did
not
wish
to
drink
at
taverns
and
appear
personally
in
such
matters
to
q
i
applied
and
effected
a
purchase
of
a
farm
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
acres
about
fifty
of
which
were
cleared
for
pounds
as
i
shall
mention
more
particularly
in
the
sequel
in
the
meantime
the
character
of
this
distinguished
individual
was
for
he
was
long
gone
to
give
an
account
of
his
misdeeds
in
the
other
world
so
remarkable
that
i
must
endeavour
to
describe
it
for
the
edification
of
the
reader
q
kept
a
shop
or
store
in
c
but
he
left
the
principal
management
of
this
establishment
to
his
clerks
while
taking
advantage
of
the
influx
of
emigrants
he
pursued
with
unrivalled
success
the
profitable
business
of
in
his
store
before
taking
to
this
business
he
had
been
accustomed
for
many
years
to
retail
goods
to
the
farmers
at
high
prices
on
the
usual
long
credit
system
he
had
thus
got
a
number
of
farmers
deeply
in
his
debt
and
in
many
cases
in
preference
to
suing
them
had
taken
mortgages
on
their
farms
by
this
means
instead
of
merely
recovering
the
money
owing
to
him
by
the
usual
process
of
law
he
was
enabled
by
threatening
to
foreclose
the
mortgages
to
compel
them
to
sell
their
farms
nearly
on
his
own
terms
whenever
an
opportunity
occurred
to
them
advantageously
to
new
comers
thus
besides
making
thirty
or
forty
per
cent
on
his
goods
he
often
realised
more
than
a
hundred
per
cent
on
his
land
speculations
in
a
new
country
where
there
is
no
great
competition
in
mercantile
business
and
money
is
scarce
the
power
and
profits
of
are
very
great
q
was
one
of
the
most
grasping
of
this
class
his
heart
was
and
his
conscience
like
gum
elastic
it
would
readily
stretch
on
the
shortest
notice
to
any
required
extent
while
his
countenance
betrayed
no
indication
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
but
i
must
not
forget
to
give
a
sketch
of
the
appearance
or
outward
man
of
this
individual
he
was
about
the
middle
size
thin
and
limber
and
somewhat
loose
in
his
lower
joints
like
most
of
the
native
canadians
and
yankees
he
had
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
and
his
long
thin
neck
was
continually
stretched
out
before
him
while
his
restless
little
cunning
eyes
were
roaming
about
in
search
of
prey
his
face
when
well
watched
was
an
index
to
his
selfish
and
unfeeling
soul
complexion
he
had
none
except
that
sempiternally
enduring
mixture
which
is
acquired
by
exposure
and
hard
drinking
his
cheeks
and
the
corners
of
his
eyes
were
marked
by
an
infinity
of
curved
lines
and
like
most
avaricious
and
deceitful
men
he
had
a
long
crooked
chin
and
that
peculiar
prominent
and
slightly
aquiline
nose
which
by
people
observant
of
such
indications
has
been
called
the
rogue
but
how
shall
i
describe
his
eye
that
small
hole
through
which
you
can
see
an
honest
man
heart
q
eye
was
like
no
other
eye
i
had
ever
seen
his
face
and
mouth
could
assume
a
expression
and
smile
but
his
eye
was
still
the
same
it
never
smiled
but
remained
cold
hard
dry
and
inscrutable
if
it
had
any
expression
at
all
it
was
an
unhappy
one
such
were
the
impressions
created
by
his
appearance
when
the
observer
was
unobserved
by
him
for
he
had
the
art
of
concealing
the
worst
traits
of
his
character
in
an
extraordinary
degree
and
when
he
suspected
that
the
curious
hieroglyphics
which
nature
had
stamped
on
his
visage
were
too
closely
scanned
he
knew
well
how
to
divert
the
attention
to
some
other
object
he
was
a
humorist
besides
in
his
way
because
he
found
that
jokes
and
fun
admirably
served
his
turn
they
helped
to
throw
people
off
their
guard
and
to
conceal
his
look
he
had
a
hard
head
as
well
as
hard
heart
and
could
stand
any
quantity
of
drink
his
drinking
however
like
everything
else
about
him
had
a
motive
and
instead
of
trying
to
appear
sober
like
other
drunkards
he
rather
wished
to
appear
a
little
elevated
in
addition
to
his
other
acquirements
q
was
a
most
accomplished
gambler
in
short
no
virtuous
man
who
employs
every
passing
moment
of
his
short
life
in
doing
good
to
his
could
be
more
devoted
and
energetic
in
his
endeavours
to
serve
god
and
mankind
than
q
was
in
his
endeavours
to
ease
them
of
their
spare
cash
he
possessed
a
great
deal
of
that
address
and
tact
which
distinguish
the
canadians
and
in
addition
to
the
current
coin
of
vulgar
flattery
which
is
found
so
useful
in
all
countries
his
quick
eye
could
discover
the
gentleman
by
a
kind
of
instinct
which
did
not
seem
quite
natural
to
his
sordid
character
and
knowing
that
such
men
are
not
to
be
taken
by
vulgar
adulation
he
could
address
them
with
deferential
respect
against
which
no
minds
are
entirely
secure
thus
he
wriggled
himself
into
their
good
graces
after
a
while
the
unfavourable
impression
occasioned
by
his
sinister
countenance
would
become
more
faint
while
his
kindness
and
apparent
indulgence
to
his
numerous
debtors
would
tell
greatly
in
his
favour
my
first
impression
of
this
man
was
pretty
nearly
such
as
i
have
described
and
though
i
suspected
and
shunned
him
i
was
sure
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
at
length
this
unfavourable
feeling
wore
off
in
some
degree
and
finding
him
in
the
best
society
of
the
place
i
began
to
think
that
his
countenance
belied
him
and
i
reproached
myself
for
my
ungenerous
suspicions
feeling
a
certain
security
in
the
smallness
of
my
available
capital
i
did
not
hesitate
in
applying
to
q
to
sell
me
a
farm
particularly
as
i
was
aware
of
his
anxiety
to
induce
me
to
settle
near
c
for
the
reasons
already
stated
i
told
him
that
pounds
was
the
very
largest
sum
i
could
give
for
a
farm
and
that
if
i
could
not
get
one
for
that
price
i
should
join
my
friends
in
the
backwoods
q
after
scratching
his
head
and
considering
for
a
few
minutes
told
me
that
he
knew
a
farm
which
he
could
sell
me
for
that
price
particularly
as
he
wished
to
get
rid
of
a
set
of
yankee
rascals
who
prevented
emigrants
from
settling
in
that
neighbourhood
we
afterwards
found
that
there
was
but
too
good
reason
for
the
character
he
gave
of
some
of
our
neighbours
q
held
a
mortgage
for
pounds
on
a
farm
belonging
to
a
certain
yankee
settler
named
joe
h
as
security
for
a
debt
incurred
for
goods
at
his
store
in
c
the
idea
instantly
struck
q
that
he
would
compel
joe
h
to
sell
him
his
farm
by
threatening
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
i
drove
out
with
q
next
day
to
see
the
farm
in
question
it
was
situated
in
a
pretty
retired
valley
surrounded
by
hills
about
eight
miles
from
c
and
about
a
mile
from
the
great
road
leading
to
toronto
there
was
an
extensive
orchard
upon
the
farm
and
two
log
houses
and
a
large
a
considerable
portion
of
the
cleared
land
was
light
and
sandy
and
the
uncleared
part
of
the
farm
situated
on
the
flat
rocky
summit
of
a
high
hill
was
reserved
for
a
sugar
bush
and
for
supplying
fuel
on
the
whole
i
was
pleased
with
the
farm
which
was
certainly
cheap
at
the
price
of
pounds
and
i
therefore
at
once
closed
the
bargain
with
q
at
that
time
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
but
that
the
farm
actually
belonged
to
the
and
i
am
to
this
day
unable
to
tell
by
what
means
he
succeeded
in
getting
h
to
part
with
his
property
the
father
of
joe
h
had
cleared
the
farm
and
while
the
soil
was
new
it
gave
good
crops
but
as
the
rich
surface
or
black
muck
as
it
is
called
became
exhausted
by
continual
cropping
nothing
but
a
poor
meagre
soil
remained
the
early
settlers
were
wretched
farmers
they
never
ploughed
deep
enough
and
never
thought
of
manuring
the
land
after
working
the
land
for
several
years
they
would
let
it
lie
waste
for
three
or
four
years
without
sowing
and
then
plough
it
up
again
for
wheat
the
greater
part
of
the
hay
raised
on
these
farms
was
sold
in
the
towns
and
the
cattle
were
fed
during
the
long
severe
winter
on
the
natural
result
of
this
poor
nourishment
was
that
their
cattle
continually
degenerated
and
great
numbers
died
every
spring
of
a
disease
called
the
hollow
horn
which
appears
to
be
peculiar
to
this
country
when
the
lands
became
sterile
from
this
exhausting
treatment
they
were
called
farms
and
the
owners
generally
sold
them
to
new
settlers
from
the
old
country
and
with
the
money
they
received
bought
a
larger
quantity
of
wild
lands
to
provide
for
their
sons
by
whom
the
same
improvident
process
was
recommenced
these
early
settlers
were
in
fact
only
fit
for
pioneers
to
a
more
thrifty
class
of
settlers
joe
h
or
uncle
joe
as
the
country
people
call
any
acquaintance
after
a
fashion
borrowed
no
doubt
from
the
dutch
settlers
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
neither
by
his
habits
nor
industry
likely
to
become
more
prosperous
than
his
neighbours
of
the
same
thoughtless
class
his
father
had
worked
hard
in
his
time
and
uncle
joe
thought
he
had
a
good
right
to
enjoy
himself
the
nearest
village
was
only
five
miles
from
his
place
and
he
was
never
without
some
excuse
for
going
thither
every
two
or
three
days
his
horse
wanted
shoeing
or
his
plough
or
waggon
wanted
to
be
fixed
by
the
blacksmith
or
carpenter
as
a
matter
of
course
he
came
home
pretty
high
for
he
was
in
the
constant
habit
of
pouring
a
of
whiskey
down
his
throat
standing
bolt
upright
at
the
bar
of
the
tavern
after
which
he
would
drink
about
the
same
quantity
of
cold
water
to
wash
it
down
these
habits
together
with
bad
farming
and
a
lazy
slovenly
helpmate
in
a
few
years
made
joe
as
poor
as
he
could
desire
to
be
and
at
last
he
was
compelled
to
sell
his
farm
to
q
after
we
had
got
settled
down
on
this
farm
i
had
often
occasion
to
drive
into
c
for
the
purpose
of
buying
groceries
and
other
necessaries
as
we
then
thought
them
at
the
store
of
q
on
these
occasions
i
always
took
up
my
quarters
for
the
time
at
the
tavern
of
our
worthy
yankee
friend
s
as
i
drove
up
to
the
door
i
generally
found
s
walking
about
briskly
on
the
boarded
platform
or
stoop
in
front
of
the
house
welcoming
his
guests
in
his
own
peculiar
style
looking
after
their
horses
and
seeing
that
his
people
were
attentive
to
their
duties
i
think
i
see
him
now
before
me
with
his
thin
erect
lathy
figure
his
snub
nose
and
face
wriggling
and
twisting
himself
about
in
his
desire
to
please
his
customers
on
stopping
in
front
of
the
tavern
shortly
after
our
settlement
on
the
farm
s
stepped
up
to
me
in
the
most
familiar
manner
imaginable
holding
out
his
hand
quite
condescendingly
ah
mister
moodie
do
you
do
and
the
old
woman
at
first
i
could
not
conceive
whom
he
meant
by
this
very
homely
appellation
and
i
very
simply
asked
him
what
person
he
alluded
to
as
i
had
no
old
woman
in
my
establishment
why
old
woman
to
be
sure
your
missus
moodie
i
guess
you
do
quite
understand
our
language
o
now
i
understand
you
she
quite
well
i
thank
you
and
how
is
our
friend
s
i
replied
laying
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
by
way
of
a
gentle
hint
for
his
future
guidance
mrs
s
i
guess
she
smart
be
right
glad
to
see
you
for
you
pretty
considerable
of
a
with
her
i
tell
you
but
now
tell
me
what
you
will
drink
for
it
my
as
he
said
these
words
he
strutted
into
the
tavern
before
me
throwing
his
head
and
shoulders
back
and
rising
on
his
tiptoes
at
every
step
s
had
been
a
very
handsome
woman
and
still
retained
much
of
her
good
looks
she
was
a
most
exemplary
housewife
and
manager
i
was
often
astonished
to
witness
the
incessant
toil
she
had
to
ensure
in
attending
to
the
wants
of
such
a
numerous
household
she
had
plenty
of
irish
helps
in
the
kitchen
but
they
knew
as
much
of
cookery
as
they
did
of
astronomy
and
poor
s
hands
as
well
as
her
head
were
in
constant
requisition
she
had
two
very
pretty
daughters
whom
she
would
not
suffer
to
do
any
rough
work
which
would
spoil
their
soft
white
hands
s
no
doubt
foresaw
that
she
could
not
expect
to
keep
such
fair
creatures
long
in
such
a
marrying
country
as
canada
and
according
to
the
common
caution
of
divines
she
held
these
blessings
with
a
loose
hand
there
was
one
sweet
little
girl
whom
i
had
often
seen
in
her
father
arms
with
her
soft
dark
eyes
and
her
long
auburn
ringlets
hanging
in
wild
profusion
over
his
shoulders
i
guess
she
likes
pa
s
would
say
when
i
remarked
her
fondness
for
him
this
little
fairy
had
a
natural
genius
for
music
and
though
she
was
only
four
years
old
she
would
sit
for
an
hour
at
a
time
at
the
door
of
our
room
to
hear
me
play
on
the
flute
and
would
afterwards
sing
all
the
airs
she
picked
up
with
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
humble
as
the
calling
of
a
may
be
considered
in
england
it
is
looked
upon
in
the
united
states
where
s
was
raised
as
extremely
respectable
and
i
have
never
met
with
women
in
any
class
of
society
elsewhere
who
possessed
more
of
the
and
unobtrusive
manners
which
should
belong
to
ladies
than
in
the
family
of
this
worthy
when
i
contrast
their
genuine
kindness
and
humanity
with
the
haughty
arrogant
airs
assumed
by
some
ladies
of
a
higher
standing
in
society
from
england
who
sojourned
in
their
house
at
the
same
time
with
ourselves
when
i
remember
their
insolent
way
of
giving
their
orders
to
s
and
their
still
more
wounding
condescension
i
confess
i
can
not
but
feel
ashamed
of
my
countrywomen
all
these
patronising
airs
i
doubt
not
were
assumed
purposely
to
impress
the
minds
of
those
worthy
people
with
an
idea
of
their
vast
superiority
i
have
sometimes
i
confess
been
a
little
annoyed
with
the
familiarity
of
the
americans
canadians
as
well
as
yankees
but
i
must
say
that
experience
has
taught
me
to
blame
myself
at
least
as
much
as
them
if
instead
of
sending
our
youthful
aristocracy
to
the
continent
of
europe
to
treat
the
natives
with
contempt
and
increase
the
unpopularity
of
the
british
abroad
while
their
stock
of
native
arrogance
is
augmented
by
the
cringing
complaisance
of
those
who
only
bow
to
their
superiority
in
wealth
they
were
sent
to
the
united
states
or
even
to
canada
they
would
receive
a
lesson
or
two
which
would
be
of
infinite
service
to
them
some
of
their
most
repulsive
prejudices
and
peculiarities
would
soon
be
rubbed
off
by
the
rough
towel
of
democracy
it
is
curious
to
observe
the
remarkable
diversity
in
the
accounts
given
by
recent
emigrants
to
this
country
of
their
treatment
and
of
the
manners
and
character
of
the
people
in
the
united
states
and
in
canada
some
meet
with
constant
kindness
others
with
nothing
but
rudeness
and
brutality
of
course
there
is
truth
in
both
accounts
but
strangers
from
an
aristocratical
country
do
not
usually
make
sufficient
allowance
for
the
habits
and
prejudices
of
a
people
of
a
land
in
which
from
the
comparatively
equal
distribution
of
property
and
the
certain
prosperity
attendant
on
industry
the
whole
constitution
of
society
is
necessarily
democratical
irrespectively
of
political
institutions
those
who
go
to
such
a
country
with
the
notion
that
they
will
carry
everything
before
them
by
means
of
pretence
and
assumption
will
find
themselves
grievously
deceived
to
use
a
homely
illustration
it
is
just
as
irrational
to
expect
to
force
a
large
body
through
a
small
aperture
in
both
cases
they
will
meet
with
unyielding
resistance
when
a
poor
and
industrious
mechanic
farmer
or
labourer
comes
here
without
pretensions
of
any
kind
no
such
complaints
are
to
be
heard
he
is
treated
with
respect
and
every
one
seems
willing
to
help
him
forward
if
in
the
manners
of
such
a
settler
should
grow
in
importance
with
his
prosperity
which
is
rarely
the
case
his
pretensions
would
be
much
more
readily
tolerated
than
those
of
any
unknown
or
untried
individual
in
a
higher
class
of
society
the
north
americans
generally
are
much
more
disposed
to
value
people
according
to
the
estimate
they
form
of
their
industry
and
other
qualities
which
more
directly
lead
to
the
acquisition
of
property
and
to
the
benefit
of
the
community
than
for
their
present
and
actual
wealth
while
they
pay
a
certain
mock
homage
to
a
wealthy
immigrant
when
they
have
a
motive
in
doing
so
they
secretly
are
more
inclined
to
look
on
him
as
a
goose
who
has
come
to
america
to
be
plucked
in
truth
many
of
them
are
so
dexterous
in
this
operation
that
the
unfortunate
victim
is
often
stripped
naked
before
he
is
aware
that
he
has
lost
a
feather
there
seems
to
be
a
fatality
attending
riches
imported
into
canada
they
are
sure
to
make
to
themselves
wings
and
flee
away
while
wealth
is
no
less
certain
to
adhere
to
the
poor
and
industrious
settler
the
great
fault
of
the
canadian
character
is
an
unwillingness
to
admit
the
just
claims
of
education
and
talent
however
unpretending
to
some
share
of
consideration
in
this
respect
the
americans
of
the
united
states
are
greatly
superior
to
the
canadians
because
they
are
better
educated
and
their
country
longer
settled
these
genuine
republicans
when
their
theory
of
the
original
and
natural
equality
among
them
is
once
cheerfully
admitted
are
ever
ready
to
show
respect
to
superiority
whether
natural
or
acquired
my
evenings
on
visiting
c
were
usually
spent
at
s
tavern
where
i
was
often
much
amused
with
the
variety
of
characters
who
were
there
assembled
and
who
from
the
familiarity
of
the
colonial
manners
had
little
chance
of
concealing
their
peculiarities
from
an
attentive
observer
mr
q
of
course
was
always
to
be
found
there
drinking
smoking
cigars
and
cracking
jokes
to
a
casual
observer
he
appeared
to
be
a
regular
boon
companion
without
an
object
but
that
of
enjoying
the
passing
hour
among
his
numerous
accomplishments
he
had
learnt
a
number
of
tricks
from
the
travelling
conjurors
who
visit
the
country
and
are
generally
willing
to
sell
their
secrets
singly
at
a
regulated
price
this
seemed
a
curious
investment
for
q
but
he
knew
how
to
turn
everything
to
account
by
such
means
he
was
enabled
to
contribute
to
the
amusement
of
the
company
and
thus
became
a
kind
of
favourite
if
he
could
not
manage
to
sell
a
lot
of
land
to
an
immigrant
or
speculator
he
would
carelessly
propose
to
some
of
the
company
to
have
a
game
at
whist
or
loo
to
pass
the
time
away
and
he
never
failed
to
conjure
most
of
their
money
into
his
pockets
at
this
time
a
new
character
made
his
appearance
at
c
at
b
an
english
farmer
of
the
true
yeoman
breed
he
was
a
corpulent
little
man
he
wore
a
brown
coat
with
ample
skirts
and
a
vast
expanse
of
vest
with
and
gaiters
b
was
a
jolly
looking
man
with
an
easy
blunt
manner
which
might
easily
pass
for
honesty
q
had
sold
him
a
lot
of
wild
land
in
some
township
by
making
b
believe
that
he
could
sell
it
again
very
soon
with
a
handsome
profit
of
course
his
bargain
was
not
a
good
one
he
soon
found
from
its
situation
that
the
land
was
quite
unsaleable
there
being
no
settlements
in
the
neighbourhood
instead
of
expressing
any
resentment
he
fairly
acknowledged
that
q
was
his
master
at
a
bargain
and
gave
him
full
credit
for
his
address
and
cunning
and
quite
resolved
in
his
own
mind
to
profit
by
the
lesson
he
had
received
now
with
all
their
natural
acuteness
and
habitual
dexterity
in
such
matters
the
canadians
have
one
weak
point
they
are
too
ready
to
believe
that
englishmen
are
made
of
money
all
that
an
emigrant
has
to
do
to
acquire
the
reputation
of
having
money
is
to
seem
quite
easy
and
free
from
care
or
anxiety
for
the
future
and
to
maintain
a
certain
degree
of
reserve
in
talking
of
his
private
affairs
b
perfectly
understood
how
to
play
his
cards
with
the
and
his
fat
jolly
physiognomy
and
rustic
provincial
manners
and
accent
greatly
assisted
him
in
the
deception
every
day
q
drove
him
out
to
look
at
different
farms
b
talked
carelessly
of
buying
some
large
block
of
land
that
would
have
cost
him
some
or
pounds
providing
he
could
only
find
the
kind
of
soil
he
particularly
liked
for
farming
purposes
as
he
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
in
making
his
selection
q
determined
to
make
him
useful
in
the
meantime
in
promoting
his
views
with
respect
to
others
he
therefore
puffed
b
up
to
everybody
as
a
norfolk
farmer
of
large
capital
and
always
appealed
to
him
to
confirm
the
character
he
gave
of
any
farm
he
wished
to
sell
to
a
new
comer
b
on
his
side
was
not
slow
in
playing
into
q
hand
on
these
occasions
and
without
being
at
all
suspected
of
collusion
in
the
evening
b
would
walk
into
the
public
room
of
the
tavern
apparently
fatigued
with
his
exertions
through
the
day
fling
himself
carelessly
on
a
sofa
and
unbutton
his
gaiters
and
the
knees
of
his
he
took
little
notice
of
anybody
unless
he
was
spoken
to
and
his
whole
demeanour
seemed
to
say
as
plainly
as
words
i
care
for
nobody
nobody
cares
for
this
was
just
the
kind
of
man
for
q
he
instantly
saw
that
he
would
be
an
invaluable
ally
and
coadjutor
without
seeming
to
be
so
when
b
made
his
appearance
in
the
evening
q
was
seldom
at
the
tavern
for
his
time
had
not
yet
come
in
the
meanwhile
b
was
sure
to
be
drawn
gradually
into
conversation
by
some
emigrants
who
seeing
that
he
was
a
practical
farmer
would
be
desirous
of
getting
his
opinion
respecting
certain
farms
which
they
thought
of
purchasing
there
was
such
an
appearance
of
blunt
simplicity
of
character
about
him
that
most
of
these
inquirers
thought
he
was
forgetting
his
own
interest
in
telling
them
so
much
as
he
did
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
would
mention
several
farms
he
had
been
looking
at
with
the
intention
of
purchasing
and
he
would
particularly
mention
some
one
of
them
as
possessing
extraordinary
advantages
but
which
had
some
one
disadvantage
which
rendered
it
ineligible
for
him
such
as
being
too
small
a
circumstance
which
in
all
probability
would
recommend
it
to
another
description
of
settler
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
q
was
or
was
not
deceived
by
b
but
though
he
used
him
for
the
present
as
a
decoy
he
no
doubt
expected
ultimately
to
sell
him
some
of
his
farms
with
a
very
handsome
profit
b
however
whose
means
were
probably
extremely
small
fought
shy
of
buying
and
after
looking
at
a
number
of
farms
he
told
q
that
on
mature
reflection
he
thought
he
could
employ
his
capital
more
profitably
by
renting
a
number
of
farms
and
working
them
in
the
english
manner
which
he
felt
certain
would
answer
admirably
in
canada
instead
of
sinking
his
capital
at
once
in
the
purchase
of
lands
q
was
fairly
caught
and
b
hired
some
six
or
seven
farms
from
him
which
he
worked
for
some
time
no
doubt
greatly
to
his
own
advantage
for
he
neither
paid
rent
nor
wages
occasionally
other
would
drop
into
the
tavern
when
a
curious
game
would
be
played
between
q
and
them
once
of
the
speculators
would
ask
another
if
he
did
not
own
some
land
in
a
particular
part
of
the
country
as
he
had
bought
some
lots
in
the
same
quarter
without
seeing
them
and
would
like
to
know
if
they
were
good
the
other
would
answer
in
the
affirmative
and
pretend
to
desire
to
purchase
the
lots
mentioned
the
former
in
his
turn
would
pretend
reluctance
and
make
a
similar
offer
of
buying
all
this
cunning
manoeuvring
would
be
continued
for
a
time
in
the
hope
of
inducing
some
third
party
or
stranger
to
make
an
offer
for
the
land
which
would
be
accepted
it
often
happened
that
some
other
person
who
had
hitherto
taken
no
part
in
the
course
of
these
conversations
and
who
appeared
to
have
no
personal
interest
in
the
matter
would
quietly
inform
the
stranger
that
he
knew
the
land
in
question
and
that
it
was
all
of
the
very
best
quality
it
would
be
endless
to
describe
all
the
little
artifices
practised
by
these
speculators
to
induce
persons
to
purchase
from
them
besides
a
few
of
these
unprincipled
traders
in
land
some
of
whom
are
found
in
most
of
the
towns
there
are
a
large
number
of
who
own
both
wild
and
improved
farms
in
all
parts
of
the
colony
who
do
not
descend
to
these
discreditable
arts
but
wait
quietly
until
their
lands
become
valuable
by
the
progress
of
improvement
in
their
neighbourhood
when
they
readily
find
purchasers
or
rather
the
purchasers
find
them
out
and
obtain
their
lands
at
reasonable
prices
in
when
we
came
to
canada
a
great
speculation
was
carried
on
in
the
lands
of
the
or
united
empire
loyalists
the
sons
and
daughters
of
these
loyalists
who
had
fled
to
canada
from
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
war
were
entitled
to
free
grants
of
lots
of
wild
land
besides
these
few
free
grants
of
land
were
made
by
the
british
government
except
those
made
to
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
and
of
course
there
was
a
rapid
rise
in
their
value
almost
all
the
persons
entitled
to
such
grants
had
settled
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
upper
province
and
as
the
large
emigration
which
had
commenced
to
canada
had
chiefly
flowed
into
the
more
western
part
of
the
colony
they
were
in
general
ignorant
of
the
increased
value
of
their
lands
and
were
ready
to
sell
them
for
a
mere
trifle
they
were
bought
by
the
speculators
at
from
to
per
acre
and
often
for
much
less
and
were
sold
again
with
an
enormous
profit
at
from
to
and
sometimes
even
per
acre
according
to
their
situation
as
to
personally
examining
these
lands
it
was
a
thing
never
thought
of
for
their
price
was
so
low
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
lose
by
the
purchase
the
supply
of
loyalists
lands
or
claims
for
land
for
a
long
time
seemed
to
be
almost
inexhaustible
for
the
loyal
refugees
appear
to
have
been
prolific
beyond
all
precedent
and
most
of
those
who
held
office
at
the
capital
of
the
province
or
who
could
command
a
small
capital
became
speculators
and
throve
prodigiously
many
persons
during
the
early
days
of
the
colony
were
thus
enriched
without
risk
or
labour
from
the
inexhaustible
quivers
of
the
loyalists
though
the
bulk
of
the
speculators
bought
lands
at
haphazard
certain
parties
who
found
favour
at
the
government
offices
managed
to
secure
the
best
lands
which
were
for
sale
or
location
before
they
were
exposed
to
fair
competition
at
the
periodical
public
sales
in
the
different
districts
thus
a
large
portion
of
the
wild
lands
in
the
colony
were
and
are
still
held
the
absentee
proprietors
profiting
from
the
increased
value
given
to
their
property
by
the
improvements
of
the
actual
settlers
while
they
contribute
little
or
nothing
to
the
cultivation
of
the
country
the
progress
of
the
colony
has
thus
been
retarded
and
its
best
interests
sacrificed
to
gratify
the
insatiable
cupidity
of
a
clique
who
boasted
the
exclusive
possession
of
all
the
loyalty
in
the
country
and
every
independent
man
who
dared
to
raise
his
voice
against
such
abuses
was
branded
as
a
republican
q
dealt
largely
in
these
rights
as
they
were
called
and
so
great
was
the
emigration
in
that
the
lands
he
bought
at
per
acre
he
could
readily
sell
again
to
emigrants
and
canadians
at
from
to
per
acre
according
to
situation
and
the
description
of
purchasers
he
met
with
i
have
stated
that
the
speculators
generally
buy
lands
at
by
this
i
mean
as
to
the
quality
of
the
lands
all
colonists
accustomed
to
observe
the
progress
of
settlement
and
the
local
advantages
which
hasten
improvement
acquire
a
peculiar
sagacity
in
such
matters
unfortunately
for
many
old
countrymen
they
are
generally
entirely
destitute
of
this
kind
of
knowledge
which
is
only
acquired
by
long
observation
and
experience
in
colonies
the
knowledge
of
the
causes
which
promote
the
rapid
settlement
of
a
new
country
and
of
those
in
general
which
lead
to
the
improvement
of
the
physical
condition
of
mankind
may
be
compared
to
the
knowledge
of
a
language
the
inhabitant
of
a
civilised
and
country
may
speak
and
write
his
own
language
with
the
greatest
purity
but
very
few
ever
reflect
on
the
amount
of
thought
metaphor
and
ingenuity
which
has
been
expended
by
their
less
civilised
ancestors
in
bringing
that
language
to
perfection
the
barbarian
first
feels
the
disadvantage
of
a
limited
means
of
communicating
his
ideas
and
with
great
labour
and
ingenuity
devises
the
means
from
time
to
time
to
remedy
the
imperfections
of
his
language
he
is
compelled
to
analyse
and
study
it
in
its
first
elements
and
to
augment
the
modes
of
expression
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
the
increasing
number
of
his
wants
and
ideas
a
colony
bears
the
same
relation
to
an
country
that
a
grammar
does
to
a
language
in
a
colony
society
is
seen
in
its
first
elements
the
country
itself
is
in
its
rudest
and
simplest
form
the
colonist
knows
them
in
this
primitive
state
and
watches
their
progress
step
by
step
in
this
manner
he
acquires
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
philosophy
of
improvement
which
is
almost
unattainable
by
an
individual
who
has
lived
from
his
childhood
in
a
highly
complex
and
artificial
state
of
society
where
everything
around
him
was
formed
and
arranged
long
before
he
came
into
the
world
he
sees
the
effects
the
causes
existed
long
before
his
time
his
place
in
society
his
portion
of
the
wealth
of
the
country
his
prejudices
his
religion
itself
if
he
has
any
are
all
more
or
less
hereditary
he
is
in
some
measure
a
mere
machine
or
rather
a
part
of
one
he
is
a
creature
of
education
rather
than
of
original
thought
the
colonist
has
to
create
he
has
to
draw
on
his
own
stock
of
ideas
and
to
rouse
up
all
his
latent
energies
to
meet
all
his
wants
in
his
new
position
thus
his
thinking
principle
is
strengthened
and
he
is
more
energetic
when
a
moderate
share
of
education
is
added
to
these
advantages
for
they
are
advantages
in
one
sense
he
becomes
a
superior
being
i
have
indulged
in
these
reflections
with
manifest
risk
of
being
thought
somewhat
prosy
by
my
more
lively
readers
in
order
to
guard
my
countrymen
english
scotch
and
irish
against
a
kind
of
presumption
which
is
exceedingly
common
among
them
when
they
come
to
canada
of
fancying
that
they
are
as
capable
of
forming
correct
opinions
on
local
matters
as
the
canadians
themselves
it
is
always
somewhat
humbling
to
our
to
be
compelled
to
confess
what
may
be
considered
an
error
of
judgment
but
my
desire
to
guard
future
settlers
against
similar
mistakes
overpowers
my
reluctance
to
own
that
i
fell
into
the
common
error
of
many
of
my
countrymen
of
purchasing
wild
land
on
speculation
with
a
very
inadequate
capital
this
was
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
much
suffering
in
which
for
many
years
my
family
became
involved
but
through
which
supported
by
trust
in
providence
and
the
energy
of
a
devoted
partner
i
continued
by
her
aid
to
struggle
until
when
least
expected
the
light
of
hope
at
length
dawned
upon
us
in
reflecting
on
this
error
for
error
and
imprudence
it
was
even
though
the
result
had
been
fortunate
i
have
still
this
poor
comfort
that
there
was
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
persons
similarly
situated
but
fell
into
the
same
mistake
of
trusting
too
much
to
present
appearances
without
sufficient
experience
in
the
country
i
had
as
i
have
already
stated
about
pounds
when
i
arrived
in
canada
this
sum
was
really
advantageously
invested
in
a
cleared
farm
which
possessed
an
intrinsic
and
not
a
merely
speculative
value
afterwards
a
small
legacy
of
about
pounds
fell
into
my
hands
and
had
i
contented
myself
with
this
farm
and
purchased
two
adjoining
cleared
farms
containing
two
hundred
acres
of
land
of
the
finest
quality
which
were
sold
far
below
their
value
by
the
thriftless
owners
i
should
have
done
well
or
at
all
events
have
invested
my
money
profitably
but
the
temptation
to
buy
wild
land
at
an
acre
which
was
expected
to
double
in
value
in
a
few
months
with
the
example
of
many
instances
of
similar
speculation
proving
successful
which
came
under
my
notice
proved
irresistible
in
emigration
was
just
at
its
height
and
a
great
number
of
emigrants
several
of
whom
were
of
the
higher
class
and
possessed
of
considerable
capital
were
directed
to
the
town
of
c
in
the
rear
of
which
extensive
tracts
of
land
were
offered
to
settlers
at
the
provincial
government
sales
had
this
extensive
emigration
continued
i
should
have
been
enabled
to
double
my
capital
by
selling
my
wild
lands
to
settlers
but
unfortunately
the
prevalence
of
cholera
during
that
year
and
other
causes
gave
such
a
serious
check
to
emigration
to
canada
that
it
has
never
been
renewed
to
the
same
extent
since
that
time
besides
the
chance
of
a
check
to
emigration
generally
the
influx
of
strangers
is
often
extremely
capricious
in
the
direction
it
takes
flowing
one
year
into
one
particular
locality
and
afterwards
into
another
both
these
results
neither
of
which
was
foreseen
by
any
one
unfortunately
for
me
ensued
just
at
that
time
it
seemed
natural
that
emigrants
should
flow
into
a
fertile
tract
of
land
and
emigration
was
confidently
expected
steadily
to
increase
these
were
our
anticipations
but
neither
of
them
was
realised
were
it
suitable
to
the
character
of
these
sketches
i
would
enter
into
the
subject
of
emigration
and
the
progress
of
improvement
in
canada
respecting
which
my
judgment
has
been
matured
by
experience
and
observation
but
such
considerations
would
be
out
of
place
in
volumes
like
the
present
and
i
shall
therefore
proceed
with
my
narrative
i
had
obtained
my
cleared
farm
on
easy
terms
and
in
so
far
as
the
probability
of
procuring
a
comfortable
subsistence
was
concerned
we
had
no
reason
to
complain
but
comfort
and
happiness
do
not
depend
entirely
on
a
sufficiency
of
the
necessaries
of
life
some
of
our
neighbours
were
far
from
being
agreeable
to
us
being
fresh
from
england
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
we
could
at
once
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
obtrusive
familiarity
of
persons
who
had
no
conception
of
any
differences
in
taste
or
manners
arising
from
education
and
habits
acquired
in
a
more
refined
state
of
society
i
allude
more
particularly
to
some
rude
and
demoralised
american
farmers
from
the
united
states
who
lived
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
our
neighbours
from
the
same
country
were
worthy
industrious
people
but
on
the
whole
the
evil
greatly
predominated
over
the
good
amongst
them
at
a
few
miles
distance
from
our
farm
we
had
some
intelligent
english
neighbours
of
a
higher
class
but
they
were
always
so
busily
occupied
with
their
farming
operations
that
they
had
little
leisure
or
inclination
for
that
sort
of
easy
intercourse
to
which
we
had
been
accustomed
if
we
called
in
the
forenoon
we
generally
found
our
neighbour
hard
at
work
in
the
fields
and
his
wife
over
head
and
ears
in
her
domestic
occupations
we
had
to
ring
the
bell
repeatedly
before
we
could
gain
admittance
to
allow
her
time
to
change
her
ordinary
dress
long
before
this
could
be
effected
or
we
could
enter
the
door
sundry
reconnoitring
parties
of
the
children
would
peep
at
us
round
the
corners
of
the
house
and
then
scamper
off
to
make
their
reports
it
seems
strange
that
sensible
people
should
not
at
once
see
the
necessity
of
accommodating
their
habits
to
their
situation
and
circumstances
and
receive
their
friends
without
appearing
to
be
ashamed
of
their
employments
this
absurdity
however
is
happily
confined
to
the
people
in
the
country
who
visit
in
the
towns
and
occasionally
are
ambitious
enough
to
give
large
parties
to
the
aristocracy
of
the
towns
the
others
who
do
not
pretend
to
vie
with
the
townspeople
in
such
follies
are
a
great
deal
more
easy
and
natural
in
their
manners
and
more
truly
independent
and
hospitable
now
that
we
are
better
acquainted
with
the
country
we
much
prefer
the
conversation
of
the
intelligent
and
unpretending
class
of
farmers
who
though
their
education
has
been
limited
often
possess
a
rich
fund
of
strong
commonsense
and
liberality
of
sentiment
and
not
unfrequently
great
observation
and
originality
of
mind
at
the
period
i
refer
to
a
number
of
the
american
settlers
from
the
united
states
who
composed
a
considerable
part
of
the
population
regarded
british
settlers
with
an
intense
feeling
of
dislike
and
found
a
pleasure
in
annoying
and
insulting
them
when
any
occasion
offered
they
did
not
understand
us
nor
did
we
them
and
they
generally
mistook
the
reserve
which
is
common
with
the
british
towards
strangers
for
pride
and
superciliousness
you
britishers
are
too
superstitious
one
of
them
told
me
on
a
particular
occasion
it
was
some
time
before
i
found
out
what
he
meant
by
the
term
superstitious
and
that
it
was
generally
used
by
them
for
new
settlers
of
the
lower
classes
were
then
in
the
habit
of
imitating
their
rudeness
and
familiarity
which
they
mistook
for
independence
to
a
certain
extent
this
feeling
still
exists
amongst
the
working
class
from
europe
but
they
have
learnt
to
keep
it
within
prudent
bounds
for
their
own
sakes
and
the
higher
class
have
learnt
to
moderate
their
pretensions
which
will
not
be
tolerated
here
where
labourers
are
less
dependent
on
them
for
employment
the
character
of
both
classes
in
fact
has
been
altered
very
much
for
the
better
and
a
better
and
healthier
feeling
exists
between
them
much
more
so
indeed
than
in
england
the
labouring
class
come
to
this
country
too
often
with
the
idea
that
the
higher
class
are
their
tyrants
and
oppressors
and
with
a
feeling
akin
to
revenge
they
are
often
inclined
to
make
their
employers
in
canada
suffer
in
their
turn
this
feeling
is
the
effect
of
certain
depressing
causes
often
remote
and
beyond
the
reach
of
legislation
but
no
less
real
on
that
account
and
just
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
poverty
and
servility
which
exists
among
the
labouring
class
in
the
particular
part
of
the
united
kingdom
from
which
they
come
will
be
the
reaction
here
when
emigrants
have
been
some
years
settled
in
canada
they
find
out
their
particular
and
just
position
as
well
as
their
duties
and
interests
and
then
they
begin
to
feel
truly
happy
the
fermentation
arising
from
the
strange
mixture
of
discordant
elements
and
feelings
gradually
subsides
but
until
this
takes
place
the
state
of
society
is
anything
but
agreeable
or
satisfactory
such
was
its
state
at
c
in
and
to
us
it
was
distasteful
that
though
averse
for
various
reasons
to
commence
a
new
settlement
we
began
to
listen
to
the
persuasions
of
our
friends
who
were
settled
in
the
township
of
d
about
forty
miles
from
c
and
who
were
naturally
anxious
to
induce
us
to
settle
among
them
moodie
brother
s
had
recently
formed
a
settlement
in
that
township
and
just
before
our
arrival
in
canada
had
been
joined
by
an
old
brother
officer
and
countryman
of
mine
t
who
was
married
to
moodie
sister
the
latter
who
like
myself
was
a
officer
had
purchased
a
lot
of
wild
land
close
to
the
farm
occupied
by
s
s
s
had
emigrated
to
canada
while
quite
a
youth
and
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
backwoods
and
with
the
use
of
the
which
he
wielded
with
all
the
ease
and
dexterity
of
a
native
i
had
already
paid
some
flying
visits
to
the
backwoods
and
found
the
state
of
society
though
rude
and
rough
more
congenial
to
our
european
tastes
and
habits
for
several
gentlemen
of
liberal
education
were
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
among
whom
there
was
a
constant
interchange
of
visits
and
good
offices
all
these
gentlemen
had
recently
arrived
from
england
ireland
or
scotland
and
all
the
labouring
class
were
also
fresh
from
the
old
country
and
consequently
very
little
change
had
taken
place
in
the
manners
or
feelings
of
either
class
there
we
felt
we
could
enjoy
the
society
of
those
who
could
sympathise
with
our
tastes
and
prejudices
and
who
from
inclination
as
well
as
necessity
were
inclined
to
assist
each
other
in
their
farming
operations
there
is
no
situation
in
which
men
feel
more
the
necessity
of
mutual
assistance
than
in
clearing
land
alone
a
man
may
fell
the
trees
on
a
considerable
extent
of
woodland
but
without
the
assistance
of
two
or
three
others
he
can
not
pile
up
the
logs
previous
to
burning
common
labours
and
common
difficulties
as
among
comrades
during
a
campaign
produce
a
social
unity
of
feeling
among
there
is
moreover
a
peculiar
charm
in
the
excitement
of
improving
a
wilderness
for
the
benefit
of
children
and
posterity
there
is
in
it
also
that
consciousness
of
usefulness
which
forms
so
essential
an
ingredient
in
true
happiness
every
tree
that
falls
beneath
the
axe
opens
a
wider
prospect
and
encourages
the
settler
to
persevere
in
his
efforts
to
attain
independence
s
had
secured
for
me
a
portion
of
the
military
grant
of
four
hundred
acres
which
i
was
entitled
to
as
a
officer
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
though
this
portion
amounted
to
only
sixty
acres
it
was
so
far
advantageous
to
me
as
being
in
a
settled
part
of
the
country
i
bought
a
clergy
reserve
of
two
hundred
acres
in
the
rear
of
the
sixty
acres
for
pound
per
acre
for
which
immediately
afterwards
i
was
offered
pounds
per
acre
for
at
that
period
there
was
such
an
influx
of
settlers
into
that
locality
that
lands
had
risen
rapidly
to
a
fictitious
price
i
had
also
purchased
one
hundred
acres
more
for
pound
per
acre
from
a
private
individual
this
also
was
considered
cheap
at
the
time
these
lots
forming
altogether
a
compact
farm
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
acres
were
situated
on
the
sloping
banks
of
a
beautiful
lake
or
rather
expansion
of
the
river
otonabee
about
wide
and
studded
with
woody
islets
from
this
lake
i
afterwards
procured
many
a
good
meal
for
my
little
family
when
all
other
means
of
obtaining
food
had
failed
us
i
thus
secured
a
tract
of
land
which
was
amply
sufficient
for
the
comfortable
subsistence
of
a
family
had
matters
gone
well
with
me
it
should
be
distinctly
borne
in
mind
by
the
reader
that
uncleared
land
in
a
remote
situation
from
markets
possesses
properly
speaking
no
intrinsic
value
like
cleared
land
for
a
great
deal
of
labour
or
money
must
be
expended
before
it
can
be
made
to
produce
anything
to
sell
my
which
amounted
to
about
pounds
per
annum
of
canadian
currency
was
sufficient
to
keep
us
supplied
with
food
and
to
pay
for
clearing
a
certain
extent
of
land
say
ten
acres
every
year
for
wheat
which
is
immediately
afterwards
sown
with
to
supply
hay
for
the
cattle
during
winter
unfortunately
at
this
period
a
great
change
took
place
in
my
circumstances
which
it
was
impossible
for
the
most
prudent
or
cautious
to
have
foreseen
an
intimation
from
the
appeared
in
all
the
newspapers
calling
on
officers
either
to
sell
their
commissions
or
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
join
some
regiment
this
was
a
hard
alternative
as
many
of
these
officers
were
situated
for
a
great
many
of
them
had
been
tempted
to
emigrate
to
canada
by
the
grants
of
land
which
were
offered
them
by
government
and
had
expended
all
their
means
in
improving
these
grants
which
were
invariably
given
to
them
in
remote
situations
where
they
were
worse
than
worthless
to
any
class
of
settlers
but
those
who
could
command
sufficient
labour
in
their
own
families
to
make
the
necessary
clearings
and
improvements
rather
than
sell
my
commission
i
would
at
once
have
made
up
my
mind
to
join
a
regiment
in
any
part
of
the
world
but
when
i
came
to
think
of
the
matter
i
recollected
that
the
expense
of
an
outfit
and
of
removing
my
family
to
say
nothing
of
sacrificing
my
property
in
the
colony
would
render
it
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
accept
this
unpleasant
alternative
after
being
my
own
master
for
eighteen
years
and
after
effectually
getting
rid
of
all
the
habits
which
render
a
military
life
attractive
to
a
young
man
under
these
circumstances
i
too
hastily
determined
to
sell
out
of
the
army
this
of
course
was
easily
managed
i
expected
to
get
about
pounds
for
my
commission
and
before
the
transaction
was
concluded
i
was
inquiring
anxiously
for
some
mode
of
investing
the
proceeds
as
to
yield
a
yearly
income
unfortunately
as
it
turned
out
i
made
a
bargain
with
q
for
shares
of
pounds
each
in
a
fine
steamer
which
had
just
been
built
at
c
and
which
was
expected
to
pay
at
least
per
cent
to
the
shareholders
this
amount
of
stock
q
offered
me
for
the
proceeds
of
my
commission
whatever
amount
it
might
be
sold
for
offering
at
the
same
time
to
return
all
he
should
receive
above
pounds
sterling
as
i
had
nothing
but
his
word
for
this
part
of
the
agreement
he
did
not
recollect
it
when
he
obtained
pounds
which
was
pounds
more
than
i
expected
some
boats
on
lake
ontario
while
the
great
emigration
lasted
and
there
was
less
competition
yielded
more
than
thirty
per
cent
and
there
seemed
then
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
new
boat
would
be
equally
profitable
it
is
possible
that
q
foresaw
what
actually
happened
or
more
probably
he
thought
he
could
employ
his
money
better
in
land
speculations
as
soon
as
the
steamer
began
to
run
a
quarrel
took
place
between
the
shareholders
who
resided
at
c
where
she
was
built
and
those
who
lived
at
the
capital
of
the
upper
province
york
as
it
was
then
called
the
consequence
was
that
she
remained
idle
a
long
time
and
at
last
she
came
under
the
entire
control
of
the
shareholders
at
york
who
managed
the
boat
as
they
liked
and
to
suit
their
own
interests
afterwards
though
the
boat
continued
to
be
profitably
employed
somehow
or
other
all
her
earnings
were
consumed
in
repairs
and
for
several
years
i
never
received
a
penny
for
my
shares
at
last
the
steamer
was
sold
and
i
only
received
about
a
fourth
part
of
my
original
stock
this
as
may
be
supposed
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
me
for
i
had
every
reason
to
think
that
i
had
not
only
invested
my
money
well
but
very
profitably
judging
from
the
profits
of
the
other
boats
on
the
lake
had
i
received
the
proceeds
of
my
commission
and
bought
bank
stock
in
the
colony
which
then
and
still
yields
eight
per
my
pounds
sterling
equal
to
pounds
currency
would
have
given
me
pounds
per
annum
which
with
my
own
labour
would
have
kept
my
family
tolerably
well
have
helped
to
pay
servants
and
have
saved
us
all
much
privation
and
harassing
anxiety
having
thus
supplied
the
painful
details
of
a
transaction
a
knowledge
of
which
was
necessary
to
explain
many
circumstances
in
our
situation
otherwise
unintelligible
i
shall
proceed
with
my
narrative
the
government
did
not
carry
out
its
intention
with
respect
to
officers
in
the
colonies
but
many
officers
like
myself
had
already
sold
their
commissions
under
the
apprehension
of
being
compelled
to
accept
this
hard
alternative
i
was
suddenly
thrown
on
my
own
resources
to
support
a
helpless
and
increasing
family
without
any
regular
income
i
had
this
consolation
however
under
my
misfortune
that
i
had
acted
from
the
best
motives
and
without
the
most
remote
idea
that
i
was
risking
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
those
depending
upon
me
i
found
very
soon
that
i
had
been
too
precipitate
as
people
often
are
in
extraordinary
positions
though
had
the
result
been
more
fortunate
most
people
would
have
commended
my
prudence
and
foresight
we
determined
however
to
bear
up
manfully
against
our
and
trust
to
that
providence
which
never
deserts
those
who
do
not
forget
their
own
duties
in
trying
circumstances
it
is
curious
how
on
such
occasions
some
stray
stanzas
which
hang
about
the
outskirts
of
the
memory
will
suddenly
come
to
our
aid
thus
i
often
caught
myself
humming
over
some
of
the
verses
of
that
excellent
moral
song
the
pilot
and
repeating
with
a
peculiar
emphasis
the
concluding
lines
of
each
stanza
fear
not
but
trust
in
providence
wherever
thou
such
songs
do
good
and
a
peculiar
blessing
seems
to
attend
every
composition
in
prose
or
verse
which
inculcates
good
moral
sentiments
or
tends
to
strengthen
our
virtuous
resolutions
this
fine
song
i
feel
assured
will
live
embalmed
in
the
memory
of
mankind
long
after
the
sickly
affected
and
unnatural
ditties
of
its
author
have
gone
to
their
merited
oblivion
sometimes
however
in
spite
of
my
good
resolutions
when
left
alone
the
dark
clouds
of
despondency
would
close
around
me
and
i
could
not
help
contrasting
the
happy
past
in
our
life
with
my
gloomy
anticipations
of
the
future
sleep
which
should
bring
comfort
and
refreshment
often
only
aggravated
my
painful
regrets
by
recalling
scenes
which
had
nearly
escaped
my
waking
memory
in
such
a
mood
the
following
verses
were
written
oh
let
me
sleep
oh
let
me
sleep
nor
wake
to
sadness
the
heart
that
sleeping
dreams
of
gladness
for
sleep
is
death
without
the
pain
then
wake
me
not
to
life
again
oh
let
me
sleep
nor
break
the
spell
that
soothes
the
captive
in
his
cell
that
bursts
his
chains
and
sets
him
free
to
revel
in
his
liberty
loved
scenes
array
in
tenderest
hue
now
rise
in
beauty
to
my
view
and
friends
around
me
stand
or
smiling
grasp
my
willing
hand
again
i
seek
my
island
home
along
the
silent
bays
i
roam
or
seated
on
the
rocky
shore
i
hear
the
angry
surges
roar
and
oh
how
sweet
the
music
seems
i
heard
amid
my
blissful
dreams
but
of
the
sadly
pleasing
strains
nought
save
the
thrilling
sense
remains
those
sounds
so
loved
in
scenes
so
dear
still
still
they
murmur
in
my
ear
but
sleep
alone
can
bless
the
sight
with
forms
that
face
with
morning
light
chapter
xiv
a
journey
to
the
woods
is
well
for
us
poor
denizens
of
earth
that
god
conceals
the
future
from
our
gaze
or
hope
the
blessed
watcher
on
life
tower
would
fold
her
wings
and
on
the
dreary
waste
close
the
bright
eye
that
through
the
murky
clouds
of
blank
despair
still
sees
the
glorious
sun
it
was
a
bright
frosty
morning
when
i
bade
adieu
to
the
farm
the
birthplace
of
my
little
agnes
who
nestled
beneath
my
cloak
was
sweetly
sleeping
on
my
knee
unconscious
of
the
long
journey
before
us
into
the
wilderness
the
sun
had
not
as
yet
risen
anxious
to
get
to
our
place
of
destination
before
dark
we
started
as
early
as
we
could
our
own
fine
team
had
been
sold
the
day
before
for
forty
pounds
and
one
of
our
neighbours
a
d
was
to
convey
us
and
our
household
goods
to
douro
for
the
sum
of
twenty
dollars
during
the
week
he
had
made
several
journeys
with
furniture
and
stores
and
all
that
now
remained
was
to
be
conveyed
to
the
woods
in
two
large
lumber
sleighs
one
driven
by
himself
the
other
by
a
younger
brother
it
was
not
without
regret
that
i
left
melsetter
for
so
my
husband
had
called
the
place
after
his
father
estate
in
orkney
it
was
a
beautiful
picturesque
spot
and
in
spite
of
the
evil
neighbourhood
i
had
learned
to
love
it
indeed
it
was
much
against
my
wish
that
it
was
sold
i
had
a
great
dislike
to
removing
which
involves
a
necessary
loss
and
is
apt
to
give
to
the
emigrant
roving
and
unsettled
habits
but
all
regrets
were
now
useless
and
happily
unconscious
of
the
life
of
toil
and
anxiety
that
awaited
us
in
those
dreadful
woods
i
tried
my
best
to
be
cheerful
and
to
regard
the
future
with
a
hopeful
eye
our
driver
was
a
shrewd
clever
man
for
his
opportunities
he
took
charge
of
the
living
cargo
which
consisted
of
my
husband
our
the
two
little
children
and
myself
besides
a
large
hamper
full
of
poultry
a
dog
and
a
cat
the
lordly
sultan
of
the
imprisoned
seraglio
thought
fit
to
conduct
himself
in
a
very
eccentric
manner
for
at
every
we
happened
to
pass
he
clapped
his
wings
and
crowed
so
long
and
loud
that
it
afforded
great
amusement
to
the
whole
party
and
doubtless
was
very
edifying
to
the
poor
hens
who
lay
huddled
together
as
mute
as
mice
that
rooster
thinks
he
on
the
top
of
the
heap
said
our
driver
laughing
i
guess
he
not
used
to
travelling
in
a
close
conveyance
listen
how
all
the
crowers
in
the
neighbourhood
give
him
back
a
note
of
defiance
but
he
knows
that
he
safe
enough
at
the
bottom
of
the
the
day
was
so
bright
for
the
time
of
year
the
first
week
in
february
that
we
suffered
no
inconvenience
from
the
cold
little
katie
was
enchanted
with
the
jingling
of
the
and
nestled
among
the
packages
kept
singing
or
talking
to
the
horses
in
her
baby
lingo
trifling
as
these
little
incidents
were
before
we
had
proceeded
ten
miles
on
our
long
journey
they
revived
my
drooping
spirits
and
i
began
to
feel
a
lively
interest
in
the
scenes
through
which
we
were
passing
the
first
twenty
miles
of
the
way
was
over
a
hilly
and
country
and
as
in
winter
the
deep
snow
fills
up
the
inequalities
and
makes
all
roads
alike
we
glided
as
swiftly
and
steadily
along
as
if
they
had
been
the
best
highways
in
the
world
anon
the
clearings
began
to
diminish
and
tall
woods
arose
on
either
side
of
the
path
their
solemn
aspect
and
the
deep
silence
that
brooded
over
their
vast
solitudes
inspiring
the
mind
with
a
strange
awe
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
leafless
branches
whose
huge
shadows
reflected
upon
the
dazzling
white
covering
of
snow
lay
so
perfectly
still
that
it
seemed
as
if
nature
had
suspended
her
operations
that
life
and
motion
had
ceased
and
that
she
was
sleeping
in
her
upon
the
bier
of
death
i
guess
you
will
find
the
woods
pretty
lonesome
said
our
driver
whose
thoughts
had
been
evidently
employed
on
the
same
subject
as
our
own
we
were
once
in
the
woods
but
emigration
has
stepped
ahead
of
us
and
made
a
cleared
part
of
the
country
when
i
was
a
boy
all
this
country
for
thirty
miles
on
every
side
of
us
was
bush
land
as
to
peterborough
the
place
was
unknown
not
a
settler
had
ever
passed
through
the
great
swamp
and
some
of
them
believed
that
it
was
the
end
of
the
what
swamp
is
that
asked
i
oh
the
great
cavan
swamp
we
are
just
two
miles
from
it
and
i
tell
you
that
the
horses
will
need
a
good
rest
and
ourselves
a
good
dinner
by
the
time
we
are
through
it
ah
moodie
if
ever
you
travel
that
way
in
summer
you
will
know
something
about
corduroy
roads
i
was
jolted
to
death
last
fall
i
thought
it
would
have
been
no
bad
notion
to
have
insured
my
teeth
before
i
left
c
i
really
expected
that
they
would
have
been
shook
out
of
my
head
before
we
had
done
manoeuvring
over
the
big
how
will
my
crockery
stand
it
in
the
next
sleigh
quoth
i
if
the
road
is
such
as
you
describe
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
not
bring
a
whole
plate
to
oh
the
snow
is
a
great
leveller
it
makes
all
rough
places
smooth
but
with
regard
to
this
swamp
i
have
something
to
tell
you
about
ten
years
ago
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
other
side
of
it
and
if
pigs
or
cattle
strayed
away
into
it
they
fell
a
prey
to
the
wolves
and
bears
and
were
seldom
recovered
an
old
scotch
emigrant
who
had
located
himself
on
this
side
of
it
so
often
lost
his
beasts
that
he
determined
during
the
summer
season
to
try
and
explore
the
place
and
see
if
there
were
any
end
to
it
so
he
takes
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
and
a
bag
of
provisions
for
a
week
not
forgetting
a
flask
of
whiskey
and
off
he
starts
all
alone
and
tells
his
wife
that
if
he
never
returned
she
and
little
jock
must
try
and
carry
on
the
farm
without
him
but
he
was
determined
to
see
the
end
of
the
swamp
even
if
it
led
to
the
other
world
he
fell
upon
a
fresh
which
he
followed
all
that
day
and
towards
night
he
found
himself
in
the
heart
of
a
tangled
wilderness
of
bushes
and
himself
half
eaten
up
with
mosquitoes
and
he
was
more
than
tempted
to
give
in
and
return
home
by
the
first
glimpse
of
light
the
scotch
are
a
tough
people
they
are
not
easily
daunted
a
few
difficulties
only
seem
to
make
them
more
eager
to
get
on
and
he
felt
ashamed
the
next
moment
as
he
told
me
of
giving
up
so
he
finds
out
a
large
thick
for
his
bed
climbs
up
and
coiling
himself
among
the
branches
like
a
bear
he
was
soon
fast
asleep
the
next
morning
by
daylight
he
continued
his
journey
not
forgetting
to
blaze
with
his
axe
the
trees
to
the
right
and
left
as
he
went
along
the
ground
was
so
spongy
and
wet
that
at
every
step
he
plunged
up
to
his
knees
in
water
but
he
seemed
no
nearer
the
end
of
the
swamp
than
he
had
been
the
day
before
he
saw
several
deer
a
raccoon
and
a
during
his
walk
but
was
unmolested
by
bears
or
wolves
having
passed
through
several
creeks
and
killed
a
great
many
snakes
he
felt
so
weary
towards
the
close
of
the
second
day
that
he
determined
to
go
home
the
next
morning
but
just
as
he
began
to
think
his
search
was
fruitless
he
observed
that
the
cedars
and
tamaracks
which
had
obstructed
his
path
became
less
numerous
and
were
succeeded
by
bass
and
soft
maple
the
ground
also
became
less
moist
and
he
was
soon
ascending
a
rising
slope
covered
with
oak
and
beech
which
shaded
land
of
the
very
best
quality
the
old
man
was
now
fully
convinced
that
he
had
cleared
the
great
swamp
and
that
instead
of
leading
to
the
other
world
it
had
conducted
him
to
a
country
that
would
yield
the
very
best
returns
for
cultivation
his
favourable
report
led
to
the
formation
of
the
road
that
we
are
about
to
cross
and
to
the
settlement
of
peterborough
which
is
one
of
the
most
promising
new
settlements
in
this
district
and
is
surrounded
by
a
splendid
back
we
were
descending
a
very
steep
hill
and
encountered
an
which
was
crawling
slowly
up
it
in
a
contrary
direction
three
people
were
seated
at
the
bottom
of
the
vehicle
upon
straw
which
made
a
cheap
substitute
for
perched
as
we
were
upon
the
crown
of
the
height
we
looked
completely
down
into
the
sleigh
and
during
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
never
saw
three
uglier
mortals
collected
into
such
a
narrow
space
the
man
was
with
a
through
which
protruded
two
dreadful
yellow
teeth
that
resembled
the
tusks
of
a
boar
the
woman
was
high
and
freckled
all
over
like
a
toad
the
boy
resembled
his
hideous
mother
but
with
the
addition
of
a
villanous
obliquity
of
vision
which
rendered
him
the
most
disgusting
object
in
this
singular
trio
as
we
passed
them
our
driver
gave
a
knowing
nod
to
my
husband
directing
at
the
same
time
the
most
quizzical
glance
towards
the
strangers
as
he
exclaimed
we
are
in
luck
sir
i
think
that
sleigh
may
be
called
beauty
we
made
ourselves
very
merry
at
the
poor
people
expense
and
d
with
his
odd
stories
and
yankeefied
expressions
amused
the
tedium
of
our
progress
through
the
great
swamp
which
in
summer
presents
for
several
miles
one
uniform
bridge
of
rough
and
unequal
logs
all
laid
loosely
across
huge
sleepers
so
that
they
jump
up
and
down
when
pressed
by
the
wheels
like
the
keys
of
a
piano
the
rough
motion
and
jolting
occasioned
by
this
collision
is
so
distressing
that
it
never
fails
to
entail
upon
the
traveller
sore
bones
and
an
aching
head
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
path
is
so
narrow
over
these
logs
that
two
waggons
can
not
pass
without
great
difficulty
which
is
rendered
more
dangerous
by
the
deep
natural
ditches
on
either
side
of
the
bridge
formed
by
broad
creeks
that
flow
out
of
the
swamp
and
often
terminate
in
of
very
ominous
dimensions
the
snow
however
hid
from
us
all
the
ugly
features
of
the
road
and
d
steered
us
through
in
perfect
safety
and
landed
us
at
the
door
of
a
little
log
house
which
crowned
the
steep
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
swamp
and
which
he
dignified
with
the
name
of
a
tavern
it
was
now
two
we
had
been
on
the
road
since
seven
and
men
women
and
children
were
all
ready
for
the
good
dinner
that
d
had
promised
us
at
this
splendid
house
of
entertainment
where
we
were
destined
to
stay
for
two
hours
to
refresh
ourselves
and
rest
the
horses
well
j
what
have
you
got
for
our
dinner
said
our
driver
after
he
had
seen
to
the
accommodation
of
his
teams
pritters
and
pork
sir
nothing
else
to
be
had
in
the
woods
thank
god
we
have
enough
of
that
vulgar
canadian
for
potatoes
d
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
us
we
plenty
of
that
same
at
home
but
hunger
good
sauce
come
be
spry
widow
and
see
about
it
for
i
am
very
i
inquired
for
a
private
room
for
myself
and
the
children
but
there
were
no
private
rooms
in
the
house
the
apartment
we
occupied
was
like
the
cobbler
stall
in
the
old
song
and
i
was
obliged
to
attend
upon
them
in
public
you
have
much
to
learn
if
you
are
going
to
the
woods
said
j
to
unlearn
you
mean
said
d
to
tell
you
the
truth
moodie
ladies
and
gentlemen
have
no
business
in
the
woods
eddication
spoils
man
or
woman
for
that
location
so
widow
turning
to
our
hostess
you
are
not
tired
of
living
alone
yet
no
sir
i
have
no
wish
for
a
second
husband
i
had
enough
of
the
first
i
like
to
have
my
own
way
to
lie
down
mistress
and
get
up
you
do
like
to
be
put
out
of
your
old
way
returned
he
with
a
mischievous
glance
she
coloured
very
red
but
it
might
be
the
heat
of
the
fire
over
which
she
was
frying
the
pork
for
our
dinner
i
was
very
hungry
but
i
felt
no
appetite
for
the
dish
she
was
preparing
for
us
it
proved
salt
hard
and
unsavoury
d
pronounced
it
very
bad
and
the
whiskey
still
worse
with
which
he
washed
it
down
i
asked
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
bread
but
they
were
out
of
tea
and
the
had
failed
and
there
was
no
bread
in
the
house
for
this
disgusting
meal
we
paid
at
the
rate
of
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
i
was
glad
when
the
horses
being
again
put
to
we
escaped
from
the
rank
odour
of
the
fried
pork
and
were
once
more
in
the
fresh
air
well
mister
did
not
you
grudge
your
money
for
that
bad
meat
said
d
when
we
were
once
more
seated
in
the
sleigh
but
in
these
parts
the
worse
the
fare
the
higher
the
i
would
not
have
cared
said
i
if
i
could
have
got
a
cup
of
tea
it
poor
trash
i
never
could
drink
tea
in
my
life
but
i
like
coffee
when
is
boiled
till
it
quite
black
but
coffee
is
not
good
without
plenty
of
what
do
you
mean
by
trimmings
he
laughed
good
sugar
and
sweet
cream
coffee
is
not
worth
drinking
without
often
in
after
years
have
i
recalled
the
coffee
trimmings
when
endeavouring
to
drink
the
vile
stuff
which
goes
by
the
name
of
coffee
in
the
houses
of
entertainment
in
the
country
we
had
now
passed
through
the
narrow
strip
of
clearing
which
surrounded
the
tavern
and
again
entered
upon
the
woods
it
was
near
sunset
and
we
were
rapidly
descending
a
steep
hill
when
one
of
the
traces
that
held
our
sleigh
suddenly
broke
d
pulled
up
in
order
to
repair
the
damage
his
brother
team
was
close
behind
and
our
unexpected
brought
the
horses
upon
us
before
j
d
could
stop
them
i
received
so
violent
a
blow
from
the
head
of
one
of
them
just
in
the
back
of
the
neck
that
for
a
few
minutes
i
was
stunned
and
insensible
when
i
recovered
i
was
supported
in
the
arms
of
my
husband
over
whose
knees
i
was
leaning
and
d
was
rubbing
my
hands
and
temples
with
snow
there
moodie
she
coming
to
i
thought
she
was
killed
i
have
seen
a
man
before
now
killed
by
a
blow
from
a
horse
head
in
the
like
as
soon
as
we
could
we
resumed
our
places
in
the
sleigh
but
all
enjoyment
of
our
journey
had
it
been
otherwise
possible
was
gone
when
we
reached
peterborough
moodie
wished
us
to
remain
at
the
inn
all
night
as
we
had
still
eleven
miles
of
our
journey
to
perform
and
that
through
a
blazed
little
travelled
and
very
much
impeded
by
fallen
trees
and
other
obstacles
but
d
was
anxious
to
get
back
as
soon
as
possible
to
his
own
home
and
he
urged
us
very
pathetically
to
proceed
the
moon
arose
during
our
stay
at
the
inn
and
gleamed
upon
the
straggling
which
then
formed
the
now
populous
and
thriving
town
of
peterborough
we
crossed
the
wild
rushing
beautiful
otonabee
river
by
a
rude
bridge
and
soon
found
ourselves
journeying
over
the
plains
or
level
heights
beyond
the
village
which
were
thinly
wooded
with
picturesque
groups
of
oak
and
pine
and
very
much
resembled
a
gentleman
park
at
home
far
below
to
our
right
for
we
were
upon
the
side
we
heard
the
rushing
of
the
river
whose
rapid
waters
never
receive
curb
from
the
iron
chain
of
winter
even
while
the
rocky
banks
are
coated
with
ice
and
the
suspends
from
every
twig
and
branch
the
most
beautiful
and
fantastic
crystals
the
black
waters
rush
foaming
along
a
thick
steam
rising
constantly
above
the
rapids
as
from
a
boiling
pot
the
shores
vibrate
and
tremble
beneath
the
force
of
the
impetuous
flood
as
it
whirls
round
islands
and
opposing
rocks
and
hurries
on
to
pour
its
tribute
into
the
rice
lake
to
swell
the
calm
majestic
grandeur
of
the
trent
till
its
waters
are
lost
in
the
beautiful
bay
of
quinte
and
finally
merged
in
the
blue
ocean
of
ontario
the
most
renowned
of
our
english
rivers
dwindle
into
little
muddy
rills
when
compared
with
the
sublimity
of
the
canadian
waters
no
language
can
adequately
express
the
solemn
grandeur
of
her
lake
and
river
scenery
the
glorious
islands
that
float
like
visions
from
fairy
land
upon
the
bosom
of
these
azure
mirrors
of
her
cloudless
skies
no
dreary
breadth
of
marshes
covered
with
flags
hide
from
our
gaze
the
expanse
of
waters
no
foul
spread
their
unwholesome
exhalations
around
the
rocky
shores
are
crowned
with
the
cedar
the
birch
the
alder
and
soft
maple
that
dip
their
long
tresses
in
the
pure
stream
from
every
crevice
in
the
limestone
the
and
canadian
rose
wave
their
graceful
blossoms
the
fiercest
droughts
of
summer
may
diminish
the
volume
and
power
of
these
romantic
streams
but
it
never
leaves
their
rocky
channels
bare
nor
checks
the
mournful
music
of
their
dancing
waves
through
the
openings
in
the
forest
we
now
and
then
caught
the
silver
gleam
of
the
river
tumbling
on
in
moonlight
splendour
while
the
hoarse
chiding
of
the
wind
in
the
lofty
pines
above
us
gave
a
fitting
response
to
the
melancholy
cadence
of
the
waters
the
children
had
fallen
asleep
a
deep
silence
pervaded
the
party
night
was
above
us
with
her
mysterious
stars
the
ancient
forest
stretched
around
us
on
every
side
and
a
foreboding
sadness
sunk
upon
my
heart
memory
was
busy
with
the
events
of
many
years
i
retraced
step
by
step
the
pilgrimage
of
my
past
life
until
arriving
at
that
passage
in
its
sombre
history
i
gazed
through
tears
upon
the
singularly
savage
scene
around
me
and
secretly
marvelled
what
brought
me
here
providence
was
the
answer
which
the
soul
gave
not
for
your
own
welfare
perhaps
but
for
the
welfare
of
your
children
the
unerring
hand
of
the
great
father
has
led
you
here
you
form
a
connecting
link
in
the
destinies
of
many
it
is
impossible
for
any
human
creature
to
live
for
himself
alone
it
may
be
your
lot
to
suffer
but
others
will
reap
a
benefit
from
your
trials
look
up
with
confidence
to
heaven
and
the
sun
of
hope
will
yet
shed
a
cheering
beam
through
the
forbidding
depths
of
this
tangled
the
road
now
became
so
bad
that
d
was
obliged
to
dismount
and
lead
his
horses
through
the
more
intricate
passages
the
animals
themselves
weary
with
their
long
journey
and
heavy
load
proceeded
at
the
moon
too
had
deserted
us
and
the
only
light
we
had
to
guide
us
through
the
dim
arches
of
the
forest
was
from
the
snow
and
the
stars
which
now
peered
down
upon
us
through
the
leafless
branches
of
the
trees
with
uncommon
brilliancy
it
will
be
past
midnight
before
we
reach
your
brother
clearing
where
we
expected
to
spend
the
night
said
d
i
wish
moodie
we
had
followed
your
advice
and
staid
at
peterborough
how
fares
it
with
you
moodie
and
the
young
ones
it
is
growing
very
we
were
now
in
the
heart
of
a
dark
and
my
mind
was
haunted
with
visions
of
wolves
and
bears
but
beyond
the
long
wild
howl
of
a
solitary
wolf
no
other
sound
awoke
the
sepulchral
silence
of
that
wood
what
a
gloomy
spot
said
i
to
my
husband
in
the
old
country
superstition
would
people
it
with
ghosts
there
are
no
ghosts
in
canada
said
d
the
country
is
too
new
for
ghosts
no
canadian
is
afear
of
ghosts
it
is
only
in
old
countries
like
that
are
full
of
sin
and
wickedness
that
people
believe
in
such
nonsense
no
human
habitation
has
ever
been
erected
in
this
wood
through
which
you
are
passing
until
a
very
few
years
ago
few
white
persons
had
ever
passed
through
it
and
the
red
man
would
not
pitch
his
tent
in
such
a
place
as
this
now
ghosts
as
i
understand
the
word
are
the
spirits
of
bad
men
that
are
not
allowed
by
providence
to
rest
in
their
graves
but
for
a
punishment
are
made
to
haunt
the
spots
where
their
worst
deeds
were
committed
i
do
believe
in
all
this
but
supposing
it
to
be
true
bad
men
must
have
died
here
before
their
spirits
could
haunt
the
place
now
it
is
more
than
probable
that
no
person
ever
ended
his
days
in
this
forest
so
that
it
would
be
folly
to
think
of
seeing
his
this
theory
of
d
had
the
merit
of
originality
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
utter
disbelief
in
supernatural
appearances
which
is
common
to
most
canadians
is
the
result
of
the
same
very
reasonable
mode
of
arguing
the
unpeopled
wastes
of
canada
must
present
the
same
aspect
to
the
new
settler
that
the
world
did
to
our
first
parents
after
their
expulsion
from
the
garden
of
eden
all
the
sin
which
could
defile
the
spot
or
haunt
it
with
the
association
of
departed
evil
is
concentrated
in
their
own
persons
bad
spirits
can
not
be
supposed
to
linger
near
a
place
where
crime
has
never
been
committed
the
belief
in
ghosts
so
prevalent
in
old
countries
must
first
have
had
its
foundation
in
the
consciousness
of
guilt
after
clearing
this
low
swampy
portion
of
the
wood
with
much
difficulty
and
the
frequent
application
of
the
axe
to
cut
away
the
fallen
timber
that
impeded
our
progress
our
ears
were
assailed
by
a
low
roaring
rushing
sound
as
of
the
falling
of
waters
that
is
herriot
falls
said
our
guide
we
are
within
two
miles
of
our
oh
welcome
sound
but
those
two
miles
appeared
more
lengthy
than
the
whole
journey
thick
clouds
that
threatened
a
had
blotted
out
the
stars
and
we
continued
to
grope
our
way
through
a
narrow
rocky
path
upon
the
edge
of
the
river
in
almost
total
darkness
i
now
felt
the
chillness
of
the
midnight
hour
and
the
fatigue
of
the
long
journey
with
double
force
and
envied
the
servant
and
children
who
had
been
sleeping
ever
since
we
left
peterborough
we
now
descended
the
steep
bank
and
prepared
to
cross
the
rapids
dark
as
it
was
i
looked
with
a
feeling
of
dread
upon
the
foaming
waters
as
they
tumbled
over
their
bed
of
rocks
their
white
crests
flashing
amid
the
darkness
of
the
night
this
is
an
ugly
bridge
over
such
a
dangerous
place
said
d
as
he
stood
up
in
the
sleigh
and
urged
his
tired
team
across
the
miserable
insecure
log
bridge
where
darkness
and
death
raged
below
and
one
false
step
of
his
jaded
horses
would
have
plunged
us
into
both
i
must
confess
i
drew
a
freer
breath
when
the
bridge
was
crossed
and
d
congratulated
us
on
our
safe
arrival
in
douro
we
now
continued
our
journey
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
but
when
in
sight
of
s
clearing
a
large
which
had
newly
fallen
across
the
narrow
path
brought
the
teams
to
a
standstill
the
mighty
trunk
which
had
lately
formed
one
of
the
stately
pillars
in
the
sylvan
temple
of
nature
was
of
too
large
dimensions
to
chop
in
two
with
axes
and
after
about
half
an
hour
labour
which
to
me
poor
cold
weary
wight
seemed
an
age
the
males
of
the
party
abandoned
the
task
in
despair
to
go
round
it
was
impossible
its
roots
were
concealed
in
an
impenetrable
wall
of
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
its
huge
branches
hung
over
the
precipitous
bank
of
the
river
we
must
try
and
make
the
horses
jump
over
it
said
d
we
may
get
an
upset
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
must
either
make
the
experiment
or
stay
here
all
night
and
i
am
too
cold
and
hungry
for
that
so
here
he
urged
his
horses
to
leap
the
log
restraining
their
ardour
for
a
moment
as
the
sleigh
rested
on
the
top
of
the
formidable
barrier
but
so
nicely
balanced
that
the
difference
of
a
straw
would
almost
have
overturned
the
vehicle
and
its
helpless
inmates
we
however
cleared
it
in
safety
he
now
stopped
and
gave
directions
to
his
brother
to
follow
the
same
plan
that
he
had
adopted
but
whether
the
young
man
had
less
coolness
or
the
horses
in
his
team
were
more
difficult
to
manage
i
can
not
tell
the
sleigh
as
it
hung
poised
upon
the
top
of
the
log
was
overturned
with
a
loud
crash
and
all
my
household
goods
and
chattels
were
scattered
over
the
road
alas
for
my
crockery
and
stone
china
scarcely
one
article
remained
unbroken
never
fret
about
the
china
said
moodie
thank
god
the
man
and
the
horses
are
i
should
have
felt
more
thankful
had
the
crocks
been
spared
too
for
like
most
of
my
sex
i
had
a
tender
regard
for
china
and
i
knew
that
no
fresh
supply
could
be
obtained
in
this
part
of
the
world
leaving
his
brother
to
collect
the
scattered
fragments
d
proceeded
on
his
journey
we
left
the
road
and
were
winding
our
way
over
a
steep
hill
covered
with
heaps
of
brush
and
fallen
timber
and
as
we
reached
the
top
a
light
gleamed
cheerily
from
the
windows
of
a
log
house
and
the
next
moment
we
were
at
my
door
i
thought
my
journey
was
at
an
end
but
here
i
was
doomed
to
fresh
disappointment
his
wife
was
absent
on
a
visit
to
her
friends
and
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
were
to
stay
with
my
sister
t
and
her
husband
with
all
this
i
was
unacquainted
and
i
was
about
to
quit
the
sleigh
and
seek
the
warmth
of
the
fire
when
i
was
told
that
i
had
yet
further
to
go
its
cheerful
glow
was
to
shed
no
warmth
on
me
and
tired
as
i
was
i
actually
buried
my
face
and
wept
upon
the
neck
of
a
hound
which
moodie
had
given
to
s
and
which
sprang
up
upon
the
sleigh
to
lick
my
face
and
hands
this
was
my
first
halt
in
that
weary
wilderness
where
i
endured
so
many
bitter
years
of
toil
and
sorrow
my
and
his
family
had
retired
to
rest
but
they
instantly
rose
to
receive
the
travellers
and
i
never
enjoyed
more
heartily
a
warm
welcome
after
a
long
day
of
intense
fatigue
than
i
did
that
night
of
my
first
sojourn
in
the
backwoods
the
otonabee
dark
rushing
foaming
river
i
love
the
solemn
sound
that
shakes
thy
shores
around
and
hoarsely
murmurs
ever
as
thy
waters
onward
bound
like
a
rash
unbridled
steed
flying
madly
on
its
course
that
shakes
with
thundering
force
the
vale
and
trembling
mead
so
thy
billows
downward
sweep
nor
rock
nor
tree
can
stay
their
fierce
impetuous
way
now
in
eddies
whirling
deep
now
in
rapids
white
with
spray
i
love
thee
lonely
river
thy
hollow
restless
roar
thy
shore
the
rocky
isles
that
sever
the
waves
that
round
them
pour
katchawanook
basks
in
light
but
thy
currents
woo
the
shade
by
the
lofty
made
that
cast
a
gloom
like
night
ere
day
last
glories
fade
thy
solitary
voice
the
same
bold
anthem
sung
when
nature
frame
was
young
no
longer
shall
rejoice
the
woods
where
erst
it
rung
lament
lament
wild
river
a
hand
is
on
thy
mane
that
will
bind
thee
in
a
chain
no
force
of
thine
can
sever
thy
furious
headlong
tide
in
murmurs
soft
and
low
is
destined
yet
to
glide
to
meet
the
lake
below
and
many
a
bark
shall
ride
securely
on
thy
breast
to
waft
across
the

one
of
the
many
expansions
of

beautiful
river
alluding
to
the
projected
improvements
on
the
trent
of
which
the
otonabee
is
a
continuation
fifteen
years
have
passed
away
since
this
little
poem
was
written
but
the
otonabee
still
rushes
on
in
its
own
wild
strength
some
idea
of
the
rapidity
of
this
river
may
be
formed
from
the
fact
that
heavy
rafts
of
timber
are
floated
down
from
herriot
falls
a
distance
of
nine
miles
from
peterborough
in
less
than
an
hour

are
bold
and
rocky

abound
in
beautiful
and
picturesque
views

man

race
stern
dweller
of
the
wild
nature
untamed
and
daring
child
the
clouds
of
the
preceding
night
instead
of
dissolving
in
snow
brought
on
a
rapid
thaw
a
thaw
in
the
middle
of
winter
is
the
most
disagreeable
change
that
can
be
imagined
after
several
weeks
of
clear
bright
bracing
frosty
weather
with
a
serene
atmosphere
and
cloudless
sky
you
awake
one
morning
surprised
at
the
change
in
the
temperature
and
upon
looking
out
of
the
window
behold
the
woods
obscured
by
a
murky
haze
not
so
dense
as
an
english
november
fog
but
more
black
and
lowering
and
the
heavens
shrouded
in
a
uniform
covering
of
clouds
deepening
into
a
livid
indigo
at
the
edge
of
the
horizon
the
snow
no
longer
hard
and
glittering
has
become
soft
and
spongy
and
the
foot
slips
into
a
wet
and
mass
at
every
step
from
the
roof
pours
down
a
continuous
stream
of
water
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
collecting
the
moisture
of
the
reeking
atmosphere
shower
it
upon
the
earth
from
every
dripping
twig
the
cheerless
and
uncomfortable
aspect
of
things
without
never
fails
to
produce
a
corresponding
effect
upon
the
minds
of
those
within
and
casts
such
a
damp
upon
the
spirits
that
it
appears
to
destroy
for
a
time
all
sense
of
enjoyment
many
persons
and
myself
among
the
number
are
made
aware
of
the
approach
of
a
by
an
intense
pain
and
weight
about
the
head
and
i
have
heard
numbers
of
canadians
complain
that
a
thaw
always
made
them
feel
bilious
and
heavy
and
greatly
depressed
their
animal
spirits
i
had
a
great
desire
to
visit
our
new
location
but
when
i
looked
out
upon
the
cheerless
waste
i
gave
up
the
idea
and
contented
myself
with
hoping
for
a
better
day
on
the
morrow
but
many
morrows
came
and
went
before
a
frost
again
hardened
the
road
sufficiently
for
me
to
make
the
attempt
the
prospect
from
the
windows
of
my
sister
log
hut
was
not
very
prepossessing
the
small
lake
in
front
which
formed
such
a
pretty
object
in
summer
now
looked
like
an
extensive
field
covered
with
snow
hemmed
in
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
a
dark
belt
of
sombre
the
clearing
round
the
house
was
very
small
and
only
just
reclaimed
from
the
wilderness
and
the
greater
part
of
it
covered
with
piles
of
brushwood
to
be
burnt
the
first
dry
days
of
spring
the
charred
and
blackened
stumps
on
the
few
acres
that
had
been
cleared
during
the
preceding
year
were
everything
but
picturesque
and
i
concluded
as
i
turned
disgusted
from
the
prospect
before
me
that
there
was
very
little
beauty
to
be
found
in
the
backwoods
but
i
came
to
this
decision
during
a
canadian
thaw
be
it
remembered
when
one
is
wont
to
view
every
object
with
jaundiced
eyes
moodie
had
only
been
able
to
secure
acres
of
his
government
grant
upon
the
upper
katchawanook
lake
which
being
interpreted
means
in
english
the
lake
of
the
waterfalls
a
very
poetical
meaning
which
most
indian
names
have
he
had
however
secured
a
clergy
reserve
of
two
hundred
acres
adjoining
and
he
afterwards
purchased
a
fine
lot
which
likewise
formed
part
of
the
same
block
one
hundred
acres
for
pounds
this
was
an
enormously
high
price
for
wild
land
but
the
prospect
of
opening
the
trent
and
otonabee
for
the
navigation
of
steamboats
and
other
small
craft
was
at
that
period
a
favourite
speculation
and
its
practicability
and
the
great
advantages
to
be
derived
from
it
were
so
widely
believed
as
to
raise
the
value
of
the
wild
lands
along
these
remote
waters
to
an
enormous
price
and
settlers
in
the
vicinity
were
eager
to
secure
lots
at
any
sacrifice
along
their
shores
after
a
lapse
of
fifteen
years
we
have
been
glad
to
sell
these
lots
of
land
after
considerable
clearings
had
been
made
upon
them
for
less
than
they
originally
cost
us
our
government
grant
was
upon
the
lake
shore
and
moodie
had
chosen
for
the
site
of
his
log
house
a
bank
that
sloped
gradually
from
the
edge
of
the
water
until
it
attained
to
the
dignity
of
a
hill
along
the
top
of
this
ridge
the
forest
road
ran
and
midway
down
the
hill
our
humble
home
already
nearly
completed
stood
surrounded
by
the
eternal
forest
a
few
trees
had
been
cleared
in
its
immediate
vicinity
just
sufficient
to
allow
the
workmen
to
proceed
and
to
prevent
the
fall
of
any
tree
injuring
the
building
or
the
danger
of
its
taking
fire
during
the
process
of
burning
the
fallow
a
neighbour
had
undertaken
to
build
this
rude
dwelling
by
contract
and
was
to
have
it
ready
for
us
by
the
first
week
in
the
new
year
the
want
of
boards
to
make
the
divisions
in
the
apartments
alone
hindered
him
from
fulfilling
his
contract
these
had
lately
been
procured
and
the
house
was
to
be
ready
for
our
reception
in
the
course
of
a
week
our
trunks
and
baggage
had
already
been
conveyed
thither
by
d
and
in
spite
of
my
sister
kindness
and
hospitality
i
longed
to
find
myself
once
more
settled
in
a
home
of
my
own
the
day
after
our
arrival
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
a
visit
from
monaghan
whom
moodie
had
once
more
taken
into
his
service
the
poor
fellow
was
delighted
that
his
as
he
always
called
little
katie
had
not
forgotten
him
but
evinced
the
most
lively
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
her
dark
friend
early
every
morning
moodie
went
off
to
the
house
and
the
first
fine
day
my
sister
undertook
to
escort
me
through
the
wood
to
inspect
it
the
proposal
was
joyfully
accepted
and
although
i
felt
rather
timid
when
i
found
myself
with
only
my
female
companion
in
the
vast
forest
i
kept
my
fears
to
myself
lest
i
should
be
laughed
at
this
foolish
dread
of
encountering
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
i
never
could
wholly
shake
off
even
after
becoming
a
constant
resident
in
their
gloomy
depths
and
accustomed
to
follow
the
alone
or
attended
with
little
children
daily
the
cracking
of
an
old
bough
or
the
hooting
of
the
owl
was
enough
to
fill
me
with
alarm
and
try
my
strength
in
a
precipitate
flight
often
have
i
stopped
and
reproached
myself
for
want
of
faith
in
the
goodness
of
providence
and
repeated
the
text
the
wicked
are
afraid
when
no
man
pursueth
but
the
righteous
are
as
bold
as
a
lion
as
if
to
shame
myself
into
courage
but
it
would
not
do
i
could
not
overcome
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
if
i
had
one
of
my
infants
with
me
the
wish
to
protect
the
child
from
any
danger
which
might
beset
my
path
gave
me
for
a
time
a
fictitious
courage
but
it
was
like
love
fighting
with
despair
it
was
in
vain
that
my
husband
assured
me
that
no
person
had
ever
been
attacked
by
wild
animals
in
the
woods
that
a
child
might
traverse
them
even
at
night
in
safety
whilst
i
knew
that
wild
animals
existed
in
those
woods
i
could
not
believe
him
and
my
fears
on
this
head
rather
increased
than
diminished
the
snow
had
been
so
greatly
decreased
by
the
late
thaw
that
it
had
been
converted
into
a
coating
of
ice
which
afforded
a
dangerous
and
slippery
footing
my
sister
who
had
resided
for
nearly
twelve
months
in
the
woods
was
provided
for
her
walk
with
indian
moccasins
which
rendered
her
quite
independent
but
i
stumbled
at
every
step
the
sun
shone
brightly
the
air
was
clear
and
invigorating
and
in
spite
of
the
treacherous
ground
and
my
foolish
fears
i
greatly
enjoyed
my
first
walk
in
the
woods
naturally
of
a
cheerful
hopeful
disposition
my
sister
was
enthusiastic
in
her
admiration
of
the
woods
she
drew
such
a
lively
picture
of
the
charms
of
a
summer
residence
in
the
forest
that
i
began
to
feel
greatly
interested
in
her
descriptions
and
to
rejoice
that
we
too
were
to
be
her
near
neighbours
and
dwellers
in
the
woods
and
this
circumstance
not
a
little
reconciled
me
to
the
change
hoping
that
my
husband
would
derive
an
income
equal
to
the
one
he
had
parted
with
from
the
investment
of
the
price
of
his
commission
in
the
stock
i
felt
no
dread
of
want
our
legacy
of
pounds
had
afforded
us
means
to
purchase
land
build
our
house
and
give
out
a
large
portion
of
land
to
be
cleared
and
with
a
considerable
sum
of
money
still
in
hand
our
prospects
for
the
future
were
in
no
way
discouraging
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
that
overlooked
our
cot
my
sister
stopped
and
pointed
out
a
among
the
trees
there
s
she
said
is
your
home
when
that
black
is
cleared
away
that
now
hides
the
lake
from
us
you
will
have
a
very
pretty
my
conversation
with
her
had
quite
altered
the
aspect
of
the
country
and
predisposed
me
to
view
things
in
the
most
favourable
light
i
found
moodie
and
monaghan
employed
in
piling
up
heaps
of
bush
near
the
house
which
they
intended
to
burn
off
by
hand
previous
to
firing
the
rest
of
the
fallow
to
prevent
any
risk
to
the
building
from
fire
the
house
was
made
of
cedar
logs
and
presented
a
superior
air
of
comfort
to
most
dwellings
of
the
same
kind
the
dimensions
were
feet
in
length
and
in
breadth
which
gave
us
a
nice
parlour
a
kitchen
and
two
small
which
were
divided
by
plank
partitions
pantry
or
there
was
none
some
rough
shelves
in
the
kitchen
and
a
deal
cupboard
in
a
corner
of
the
parlour
being
the
extent
of
our
accommodations
in
that
way
our
servant
mary
tate
was
busy
scrubbing
out
the
parlour
and
but
the
kitchen
and
the
off
it
were
still
in
chips
and
filled
with
the
carpenter
bench
and
tools
and
all
our
luggage
such
as
it
was
it
was
a
palace
when
compared
to
old
satan
log
hut
or
the
miserable
cabin
we
had
wintered
in
during
the
severe
winter
of
and
i
regarded
it
with
complacency
as
my
future
home
while
we
were
standing
outside
the
building
conversing
with
my
husband
a
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
morgan
who
had
lately
purchased
land
in
that
vicinity
went
into
the
kitchen
to
light
his
pipe
at
the
stove
and
with
true
backwood
carelessness
let
the
hot
cinder
fall
among
the
dry
chips
that
strewed
the
floor
a
few
minutes
after
the
whole
mass
was
in
a
blaze
and
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
that
moodie
and
r
succeeded
in
putting
out
the
fire
thus
were
we
nearly
deprived
of
our
home
before
we
had
taken
up
our
abode
in
it
the
indifference
to
the
danger
of
fire
in
a
country
where
most
of
the
dwellings
are
composed
of
inflammable
materials
is
truly
astonishing
accustomed
to
see
enormous
fires
blazing
on
every
and
to
sleep
in
front
of
these
fires
his
bedding
often
riddled
with
holes
made
by
hot
particles
of
wood
flying
out
during
the
night
and
igniting
beneath
his
very
nose
the
sturdy
backwoodsman
never
dreads
an
enemy
in
the
element
that
he
is
used
to
regard
as
his
best
friend
yet
what
awful
accidents
what
ruinous
calamities
arise
out
of
this
criminal
negligence
both
to
himself
and
others
a
few
days
after
this
adventure
we
bade
adieu
to
my
sister
and
took
possession
of
our
new
dwelling
and
commenced
a
life
in
the
the
first
spring
we
spent
in
comparative
ease
and
idleness
our
cows
had
been
left
upon
our
old
place
during
the
winter
the
ground
had
to
be
cleared
before
it
could
receive
a
crop
of
any
kind
and
i
had
little
to
do
but
to
wander
by
the
lake
shore
or
among
the
woods
and
amuse
myself
these
were
the
halcyon
days
of
the
bush
my
husband
had
purchased
a
very
light
cedar
canoe
to
which
he
attached
a
keel
and
a
sail
and
most
of
our
leisure
hours
directly
the
snows
melted
were
spent
upon
the
water
these
fishing
and
shooting
excursions
were
delightful
the
pure
beauty
of
the
canadian
water
the
sombre
but
august
grandeur
of
the
vast
forest
that
hemmed
us
in
on
every
side
and
shut
us
out
from
the
rest
of
the
world
soon
cast
a
magic
spell
upon
our
spirits
and
we
began
to
feel
charmed
with
the
freedom
and
solitude
around
us
every
object
was
new
to
us
we
felt
as
if
we
were
the
first
discoverers
of
every
beautiful
flower
and
stately
tree
that
attracted
our
attention
and
we
gave
names
to
fantastic
rocks
and
fairy
isles
and
raised
imaginary
houses
and
bridges
on
every
picturesque
spot
which
we
floated
past
during
our
aquatic
excursions
i
learned
the
use
of
the
paddle
and
became
quite
a
proficient
in
the
gentle
craft
it
was
not
long
before
we
received
visits
from
the
indians
a
people
whose
beauty
talents
and
good
qualities
have
been
somewhat
overrated
and
invested
with
a
poetical
interest
which
they
scarcely
deserve
their
honesty
and
love
of
truth
are
the
finest
traits
in
characters
otherwise
dark
and
unlovely
but
these
are
two
attributes
and
from
them
spring
all
that
is
generous
and
ennobling
about
them
there
never
was
a
people
more
sensible
of
kindness
or
more
grateful
for
any
little
act
of
benevolence
exercised
towards
them
we
met
them
with
confidence
our
dealings
with
them
were
conducted
with
the
strictest
integrity
and
they
became
attached
to
our
persons
and
in
no
single
instance
ever
destroyed
the
good
opinion
we
entertained
of
them
the
tribes
that
occupy
the
shores
of
all
these
inland
waters
back
of
the
great
lakes
belong
to
the
chippewa
or
missasagua
indians
perhaps
the
least
attractive
of
all
these
wild
people
both
with
regard
to
their
physical
and
mental
endowments
the
men
of
this
tribe
are
generally
small
of
stature
with
very
coarse
and
repulsive
features
the
forehead
is
low
and
retreating
the
observing
faculties
large
the
intellectual
ones
scarcely
developed
the
ears
large
and
standing
off
from
the
face
the
eyes
looking
towards
the
temples
keen
and
far
apart
the
prominent
the
nose
long
and
flat
the
nostrils
very
round
the
projecting
massy
and
brutal
the
mouth
expressing
ferocity
and
sullen
determination
the
teeth
large
even
and
dazzlingly
white
the
mouth
of
the
female
differs
widely
in
expression
from
that
of
the
male
the
lips
are
fuller
the
jaw
less
projecting
and
the
smile
is
simple
and
agreeable
the
women
are
a
merry
set
and
their
constant
laugh
and
incessant
prattle
form
a
strange
contrast
to
the
iron
taciturnity
of
their
grim
lords
now
i
am
upon
the
subject
i
will
recapitulate
a
few
traits
and
sketches
of
these
people
as
they
came
under
my
own
immediate
observation
a
dry
not
far
from
the
house
by
the
lake
shore
had
been
their
usual
place
of
encampment
for
many
years
the
whole
block
of
land
was
almost
entirely
covered
with
maple
trees
and
had
originally
been
an
indian
although
the
favourite
spot
had
now
passed
into
the
hands
of
strangers
they
still
frequented
the
place
to
make
canoes
and
baskets
to
fish
and
shoot
and
occasionally
to
follow
their
old
occupation
scarcely
a
week
passed
away
without
my
being
visited
by
the
dark
strangers
and
as
my
husband
never
allowed
them
to
eat
with
the
servants
who
viewed
them
with
the
same
horror
that
d
did
black
mollineux
but
brought
them
to
his
own
table
they
soon
grew
friendly
and
communicative
and
would
point
to
every
object
that
attracted
their
attention
asking
a
thousand
questions
as
to
its
use
the
material
of
which
it
was
made
and
if
we
were
inclined
to
exchange
it
for
their
commodities
with
a
large
map
of
canada
they
were
infinitely
delighted
in
a
moment
they
recognised
every
bay
and
headland
in
ontario
and
almost
screamed
with
delight
when
following
the
course
of
the
trent
with
their
fingers
they
came
to
their
own
lake
how
eagerly
each
pointed
out
the
spot
to
his
fellows
how
intently
their
black
heads
were
bent
down
and
their
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
the
map
what
strange
uncouth
exclamations
of
surprise
burst
from
their
lips
as
they
rapidly
repeated
the
indian
names
for
every
lake
and
river
on
this
wonderful
piece
of
paper
the
old
chief
peter
nogan
begged
hard
for
the
coveted
treasure
he
would
give
canoe
venison
duck
fish
for
it
and
more
by
and
i
felt
sorry
that
i
was
unable
to
gratify
his
wishes
but
the
map
had
cost
upwards
of
six
dollars
and
was
daily
consulted
by
my
husband
in
reference
to
the
names
and
situations
of
localities
in
the
neighbourhood
i
had
in
my
possession
a
curious
japanese
sword
which
had
been
given
to
me
by
an
uncle
of
tom
wilson
a
strange
gift
to
a
young
lady
but
it
was
on
account
of
its
curiosity
and
had
no
reference
to
my
warlike
propensities
this
sword
was
broad
and
in
the
blade
and
in
shape
resembled
a
moving
snake
the
hilt
was
formed
of
a
hideous
carved
image
of
one
of
their
and
a
more
wretch
was
never
conceived
by
the
most
distorted
imagination
he
was
represented
in
a
sitting
attitude
the
eagle
claws
that
formed
his
hands
resting
upon
his
knees
his
legs
terminated
in
lion
paws
and
his
face
was
a
strange
compound
of
beast
and
bird
the
upper
part
of
his
person
being
covered
with
feathers
the
lower
with
long
shaggy
hair
the
case
of
this
awful
weapon
was
made
of
wood
and
in
spite
of
its
serpentine
form
fitted
it
exactly
no
trace
of
a
join
could
be
found
in
this
scabbard
which
was
of
hard
wood
and
highly
polished
one
of
my
indian
friends
found
this
sword
lying
upon
the
bookshelf
and
he
hurried
to
communicate
the
important
discovery
to
his
companions
moodie
was
absent
and
they
brought
it
to
me
to
demand
an
explanation
of
the
figure
that
formed
the
hilt
i
told
them
that
it
was
a
weapon
that
belonged
to
a
very
fierce
people
who
lived
in
the
east
far
over
the
great
salt
lake
that
they
were
not
christians
as
we
were
but
said
their
prayers
to
images
made
of
silver
and
gold
and
ivory
and
wood
and
that
this
was
one
of
them
that
before
they
went
into
battle
they
said
their
prayers
to
that
hideous
thing
which
they
had
made
with
their
own
hands
the
indians
were
highly
amused
by
this
relation
and
passed
the
sword
from
one
to
the
other
exclaiming
a
god
owgh
a
god
but
in
spite
of
these
outward
demonstrations
of
contempt
i
was
sorry
to
perceive
that
this
circumstance
gave
the
weapon
a
great
value
in
their
eyes
and
they
regarded
it
with
a
sort
of
mysterious
awe
for
several
days
they
continued
to
visit
the
house
bringing
along
with
them
some
fresh
companion
to
look
at
moodie
god
until
vexed
and
annoyed
by
the
delight
they
manifested
at
the
sight
of
the
monster
i
refused
to
gratify
their
curiosity
by
not
producing
him
again
the
manufacture
of
the
sheath
which
had
caused
me
much
perplexity
was
explained
by
old
peter
in
a
minute
is
burnt
out
he
said
instrument
made
like
sword
heat
burnt
through
polished
had
i
demanded
a
whole
fleet
of
canoes
for
my
japanese
sword
i
am
certain
they
would
have
agreed
to
the
bargain
the
indian
possesses
great
taste
which
is
displayed
in
the
carving
of
his
paddles
in
the
shape
of
his
canoes
in
the
elegance
and
symmetry
of
his
bows
in
the
cut
of
his
leggings
and
moccasins
the
sheath
of
his
and
in
all
the
little
ornaments
in
which
he
delights
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
settler
to
imitate
to
perfection
an
indian
paddle
my
husband
made
very
creditable
attempts
but
still
there
was
something
wanting
the
elegance
of
the
indian
finish
was
not
there
if
you
show
them
a
good
print
they
invariably
point
out
the
most
natural
and
the
figure
in
the
group
they
are
particularly
delighted
with
pictures
examine
them
long
and
carefully
and
seem
to
feel
an
pleasure
in
observing
the
effect
produced
by
light
and
shade
i
had
been
showing
john
nogan
the
eldest
son
of
old
peter
some
beautiful
coloured
engravings
of
celebrated
females
to
my
astonishment
he
pounced
upon
the
best
and
grunted
out
his
admiration
in
the
most
approved
indian
fashion
after
having
looked
for
a
long
time
at
all
the
pictures
very
attentively
he
took
his
dog
sancho
upon
his
knee
and
showed
him
the
pictures
with
as
much
gravity
as
if
the
animal
really
could
have
shared
in
his
pleasure
the
vanity
of
these
grave
men
is
highly
amusing
they
seem
perfectly
unconscious
of
it
themselves
and
it
is
exhibited
in
the
most
manner
peter
and
his
son
john
were
taking
tea
with
us
when
we
were
joined
by
my
brother
s
the
latter
was
giving
us
an
account
of
the
marriage
of
peter
jones
the
celebrated
indian
preacher
i
can
not
think
he
said
how
any
lady
of
property
and
education
could
marry
such
a
man
as
jones
why
he
as
ugly
as
peter
this
was
said
not
with
any
idea
of
insulting
the
on
the
score
of
his
beauty
of
which
he
possessed
not
the
smallest
particle
but
in
total
forgetfulness
that
our
guest
understood
english
never
shall
i
forget
the
red
flash
of
that
fierce
dark
eye
as
it
glared
upon
my
unconscious
brother
i
would
not
have
received
such
a
fiery
glance
for
all
the
wealth
that
peter
jones
obtained
with
his
saxon
bride
john
nogan
was
highly
amused
by
his
indignation
he
hid
his
face
behind
the
chief
and
though
he
kept
perfectly
still
his
whole
frame
was
convulsed
with
suppressed
laughter
a
plainer
human
being
than
poor
peter
could
scarcely
be
imagined
yet
he
certainly
deemed
himself
handsome
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
their
ideas
of
personal
beauty
differ
very
widely
from
ours
tom
nogan
the
chief
brother
had
a
very
large
fat
ugly
squaw
for
his
wife
she
was
a
mountain
of
tawny
flesh
and
but
for
the
innocent
expression
which
like
a
bright
sunbeam
penetrating
a
swarthy
cloud
spread
all
around
a
kindly
glow
she
might
have
been
termed
hideous
this
woman
they
considered
very
handsome
calling
her
a
fine
squaw
clever
squaw
a
much
good
woman
though
in
what
her
superiority
consisted
i
never
could
discover
often
as
i
visited
the
wigwam
she
was
very
dirty
and
appeared
quite
indifferent
to
the
claims
of
common
decency
in
the
disposal
of
the
few
filthy
rags
that
covered
her
she
was
however
very
expert
in
all
indian
craft
no
jew
could
drive
a
better
bargain
than
tom
and
her
urchins
of
whom
she
was
the
happy
mother
of
five
or
six
were
as
cunning
and
avaricious
as
herself
one
day
she
visited
me
bringing
along
with
her
a
very
pretty
covered
basket
for
sale
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
for
it
but
could
obtain
from
her
no
satisfactory
answer
i
showed
her
a
small
piece
of
silver
she
shook
her
head
i
tempted
her
with
pork
and
flour
but
she
required
neither
i
had
just
given
up
the
idea
of
dealing
with
her
in
despair
when
she
suddenly
seized
upon
me
and
lifting
up
my
gown
pointed
exultingly
to
my
quilted
petticoat
clapping
her
hands
and
laughing
immoderately
another
time
she
led
me
all
over
the
house
to
show
me
what
she
wanted
in
exchange
for
my
patience
was
well
nigh
exhausted
in
following
her
from
place
to
place
in
her
attempt
to
discover
the
coveted
article
when
hanging
upon
a
peg
in
my
chamber
she
espied
a
pair
of
trousers
belonging
to
my
husband
the
riddle
was
solved
with
a
joyful
cry
she
pointed
to
them
exclaiming
take
basket
give
them
it
was
with
no
small
difficulty
that
i
rescued
the
indispensables
from
her
grasp
from
this
woman
i
learned
a
story
of
indian
coolness
and
courage
which
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
one
of
their
squaws
a
near
relation
of
her
own
had
accompanied
her
husband
on
a
hunting
expedition
into
the
forest
he
had
been
very
successful
and
having
killed
more
deer
than
they
could
well
carry
home
he
went
to
the
house
of
a
white
man
to
dispose
of
some
of
it
leaving
the
squaw
to
take
care
of
the
rest
until
his
return
she
sat
carelessly
upon
the
log
with
his
in
her
hand
when
she
heard
the
breaking
of
branches
near
her
and
turning
round
beheld
a
great
bear
only
a
few
paces
from
her
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
and
seeing
that
the
animal
was
very
hungry
and
determined
to
come
to
close
quarters
she
rose
and
placed
her
back
against
a
small
tree
holding
her
knife
close
to
her
breast
and
in
a
straight
line
with
the
bear
the
shaggy
monster
came
on
she
remained
motionless
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
her
enemy
and
as
his
huge
arms
closed
around
her
she
slowly
drove
the
knife
into
his
heart
the
bear
uttered
a
hideous
cry
and
sank
dead
at
her
feet
when
the
indian
returned
he
found
the
courageous
woman
taking
the
skin
from
the
carcass
of
the
formidable
brute
what
iron
nerves
these
people
must
possess
when
even
a
woman
could
dare
and
do
a
deed
like
this
the
wolf
they
hold
in
great
contempt
and
scarcely
deign
to
consider
him
as
an
enemy
peter
nogan
assured
me
that
he
never
was
near
enough
to
one
in
his
life
to
shoot
it
that
except
in
large
companies
and
when
greatly
pressed
by
hunger
they
rarely
attack
men
they
hold
the
lynx
or
wolverine
in
much
dread
as
they
often
spring
from
trees
upon
their
prey
fastening
upon
the
throat
with
their
sharp
teeth
and
claws
from
which
a
person
in
the
dark
could
scarcely
free
himself
without
first
receiving
a
dangerous
wound
the
cry
of
this
animal
is
very
terrifying
resembling
the
shrieks
of
a
human
creature
in
mortal
agony
my
husband
was
anxious
to
collect
some
of
the
native
indian
airs
as
they
all
sing
well
and
have
a
fine
ear
for
music
but
all
his
efforts
proved
abortive
john
he
said
to
young
nogan
who
played
very
creditably
on
the
flute
and
had
just
concluded
the
popular
air
of
sweet
home
can
not
you
play
me
one
of
your
own
songs
yes
but
no
leave
me
to
be
the
judge
of
that
can
not
you
give
me
a
yes
but
no
good
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
a
no
fit
for
white
man
with
an
air
of
contempt
no
good
no
good
do
john
sing
us
a
said
i
laughing
if
you
have
such
a
thing
in
your
oh
much
very
much
bad
bad
no
good
for
christian
man
indian
song
no
good
for
white
this
was
very
tantalising
as
their
songs
sounded
very
sweetly
from
the
lips
of
their
squaws
and
i
had
a
great
desire
and
curiosity
to
get
some
of
them
rendered
into
english
to
my
husband
they
gave
the
name
of
the
musician
but
i
have
forgotten
the
indian
word
it
signified
the
maker
of
sweet
sounds
they
listened
with
intense
delight
to
the
notes
of
his
flute
maintaining
a
breathless
silence
during
the
performance
their
dark
eyes
flashing
into
fierce
light
at
a
martial
strain
or
softening
with
the
plaintive
and
tender
the
cunning
which
they
display
in
their
contests
with
their
enemies
in
their
hunting
and
in
making
bargains
with
the
whites
who
are
too
apt
to
impose
on
their
ignorance
seems
to
spring
more
from
a
law
of
necessity
forced
upon
them
by
their
isolated
position
and
precarious
mode
of
life
than
from
any
innate
wish
to
betray
the
indian
face
after
all
is
a
perfect
index
of
his
mind
the
eye
changes
its
expression
with
every
impulse
and
passion
and
shows
what
is
passing
within
as
clearly
as
the
lightning
in
a
dark
night
betrays
the
course
of
the
stream
i
can
not
think
that
deceit
forms
any
prominent
trait
in
the
indian
character
they
invariably
act
with
the
strictest
honour
towards
those
who
never
attempt
to
impose
upon
them
it
is
natural
for
a
deceitful
person
to
take
advantage
of
the
credulity
of
others
the
genuine
indian
never
utters
a
falsehood
and
never
employs
flattery
that
powerful
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
insidious
in
his
communications
with
the
whites
his
worst
traits
are
those
which
he
has
in
common
with
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
and
which
his
intercourse
with
the
lowest
order
of
civilised
men
who
in
point
of
moral
worth
are
greatly
his
inferiors
and
the
pernicious
effects
of
strong
drink
have
greatly
tended
to
inflame
and
debate
it
is
a
melancholy
truth
and
deeply
to
be
lamented
that
the
vicinity
of
european
settlers
has
always
produced
a
very
demoralising
effect
upon
the
indians
as
a
proof
of
this
i
will
relate
a
simple
anecdote
john
of
rice
lake
a
very
sensible
indian
was
conversing
with
me
about
their
language
and
the
difficulty
he
found
in
understanding
the
books
written
in
indian
for
their
use
among
other
things
i
asked
him
if
his
people
ever
swore
or
used
profane
language
towards
the
deity
the
man
regarded
me
with
a
sort
of
stern
horror
as
he
replied
indian
till
after
he
knew
your
people
never
swore
no
bad
word
in
indian
indian
must
learn
your
words
to
swear
and
take
god
name
in
oh
what
a
reproof
to
christian
men
i
felt
abashed
and
degraded
in
the
eyes
of
this
poor
savage
who
ignorant
as
he
was
in
many
respects
yet
possessed
that
first
great
attribute
of
the
soul
a
deep
reverence
for
the
supreme
being
how
inferior
were
thousands
of
my
countrymen
to
him
in
this
important
point
the
affection
of
indian
parents
to
their
children
and
the
deference
which
they
pay
to
the
aged
is
another
beautiful
and
touching
trait
in
their
character
one
extremely
cold
wintry
day
as
i
was
huddled
with
my
little
ones
over
the
stove
the
door
softly
unclosed
and
the
moccasined
foot
of
an
indian
crossed
the
floor
i
raised
my
head
for
i
was
too
much
accustomed
to
their
sudden
appearance
at
any
hour
to
feel
alarmed
and
perceived
a
tall
woman
standing
silently
and
respectfully
before
me
wrapped
in
a
large
blanket
the
moment
she
caught
my
eye
she
dropped
the
folds
of
her
covering
from
around
her
and
laid
at
my
feet
the
attenuated
figure
of
a
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
papouse
die
she
said
mournfully
clasping
her
hands
against
her
breast
and
looking
down
upon
the
suffering
lad
with
the
most
heartfelt
expression
of
maternal
love
while
large
tears
trickled
down
her
dark
face
moodie
squaw
save
papouse
poor
indian
woman
much
her
child
was
beyond
all
human
aid
i
looked
anxiously
upon
him
and
knew
by
the
features
and
purple
hue
of
his
wasted
cheek
that
he
had
not
many
hours
to
live
i
could
only
answer
with
tears
her
agonising
appeal
to
my
skill
try
and
save
him
all
die
but
she
held
up
five
of
her
fingers
brought
him
all
the
way
from
mutta
lake
upon
my
back
for
white
squaw
to
mud
lake
or
lake
shemong
in
indian
i
can
not
cure
him
my
poor
friend
he
is
in
god
care
in
a
few
hours
he
will
be
with
the
child
was
seized
with
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
which
i
expected
every
moment
would
terminate
his
frail
existence
i
gave
him
a
teaspoonful
of
currant
jelly
which
he
took
with
avidity
but
could
not
retain
a
moment
on
his
stomach
papouse
die
murmured
the
poor
woman
alone
alone
no
papouse
the
mother
all
she
began
the
poor
sufferer
in
her
blanket
i
got
her
some
food
and
begged
her
to
stay
and
rest
herself
but
she
was
too
much
distressed
to
eat
and
too
restless
to
remain
she
said
little
but
her
face
expressed
the
keenest
anguish
she
took
up
her
mournful
load
pressed
for
a
moment
his
wasted
burning
hand
in
hers
and
left
the
room
my
heart
followed
her
a
long
way
on
her
melancholy
journey
think
what
this
woman
love
must
have
been
for
that
dying
son
when
she
had
carried
a
lad
of
his
age
six
miles
through
the
deep
snow
upon
her
back
on
such
a
day
in
the
hope
of
my
being
able
to
do
him
some
good
poor
mother
i
learned
from
joe
muskrat
squaw
some
days
after
that
the
boy
died
a
few
minutes
after
elizabeth
iron
his
mother
got
home
they
never
forget
any
little
act
of
kindness
one
cold
night
late
in
the
fall
my
hospitality
was
demanded
by
six
squaws
and
puzzled
i
was
how
to
accommodate
them
all
i
at
last
determined
to
give
them
the
use
of
the
parlour
floor
during
the
night
among
these
women
there
was
one
very
old
whose
hair
was
as
white
as
snow
she
was
the
only
indian
i
ever
saw
and
on
that
account
i
regarded
her
with
peculiar
interest
i
knew
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
chief
by
the
scarlet
embroidered
leggings
which
only
the
wives
and
daughters
of
chiefs
are
allowed
to
wear
the
old
squaw
had
a
very
pleasing
countenance
but
i
tried
in
vain
to
draw
her
into
conversation
she
evidently
did
not
understand
me
and
the
muskrat
squaw
and
betty
cow
were
laughing
at
my
attempts
to
draw
her
out
i
administered
supper
to
them
with
my
own
hands
and
after
i
had
satisfied
their
wants
which
is
no
very
easy
task
for
they
have
great
appetites
i
told
our
servant
to
bring
in
several
spare
mattresses
and
blankets
for
their
use
now
mind
jenny
and
give
the
old
squaw
the
best
bed
i
said
the
others
are
young
and
can
put
up
with
a
little
the
old
indian
glanced
at
me
with
her
keen
bright
eye
but
i
had
no
idea
that
she
comprehended
what
i
said
some
weeks
after
this
as
i
was
sweeping
over
my
parlour
floor
a
slight
tap
drew
me
to
the
door
on
opening
it
i
perceived
the
old
squaw
who
immediately
slipped
into
my
hand
a
set
of
bark
trays
fitting
one
within
the
other
and
exhibiting
the
very
best
sample
of
the
porcupine
while
i
stood
wondering
what
this
might
mean
the
good
old
creature
fell
upon
my
neck
and
kissing
me
exclaimed
you
remember
old
squaw
make
her
comfortable
old
squaw
no
forget
you
keep
them
for
her
sake
and
before
i
could
detain
her
she
ran
down
the
hill
with
a
swiftness
which
seemed
to
bid
defiance
to
years
i
never
saw
this
interesting
indian
again
and
i
concluded
that
she
died
during
the
winter
for
she
must
have
been
of
a
great
age
my
dear
reader
i
am
afraid
i
shall
tire
you
with
my
indian
stories
but
you
must
bear
with
me
patiently
whilst
i
give
you
a
few
more
the
real
character
of
a
people
can
be
more
truly
gathered
from
such
seemingly
trifling
incidents
than
from
any
ideas
we
may
form
of
them
from
the
great
facts
in
their
history
and
this
is
my
reason
for
detailing
events
which
might
otherwise
appear
insignificant
and
unimportant
a
friend
was
staying
with
us
who
wished
much
to
obtain
a
likeness
of
old
peter
i
promised
to
try
and
make
a
sketch
of
the
old
man
the
next
time
he
paid
us
a
visit
that
very
afternoon
he
brought
us
some
ducks
in
exchange
for
pork
and
moodie
asked
him
to
stay
and
take
a
glass
of
whiskey
with
him
and
his
friend
k
the
old
man
had
arrayed
himself
in
a
new
bound
with
red
and
the
seams
all
decorated
with
the
same
gay
material
his
leggings
and
moccasins
were
new
and
elaborately
fringed
and
to
cap
the
climax
of
the
whole
he
had
a
blue
cloth
conical
cap
upon
his
head
ornamented
with
a
deer
tail
dyed
blue
and
several
cock
feathers
he
was
evidently
very
much
taken
up
with
the
magnificence
of
his
own
appearance
for
he
often
glanced
at
himself
in
a
small
that
hung
opposite
with
a
look
of
grave
satisfaction
sitting
apart
that
i
might
not
attract
his
observation
i
got
a
tolerably
faithful
likeness
of
the
old
man
which
after
slightly
colouring
to
show
more
plainly
his
indian
finery
i
quietly
handed
over
to
k
sly
as
i
thought
myself
my
occupation
and
the
object
of
it
had
not
escaped
the
keen
eye
of
the
old
man
he
rose
came
behind
k
chair
and
regarded
the
picture
with
a
most
affectionate
eye
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
angry
at
the
liberty
i
had
taken
no
such
thing
he
was
as
pleased
as
punch
that
peter
he
grunted
give
me
put
up
in
wigwam
make
dog
too
owgh
owgh
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
chuckled
with
delight
k
had
some
difficulty
in
coaxing
the
picture
from
the
old
chief
so
pleased
was
he
with
this
rude
representation
of
himself
he
pointed
to
every
particular
article
of
his
dress
and
dwelt
with
peculiar
glee
on
the
cap
and
blue
deer
tail
a
few
days
after
this
i
was
painting
a
beautiful
little
that
our
man
had
shot
out
of
a
large
flock
that
alighted
near
the
door
i
was
so
intent
upon
my
task
to
which
i
was
putting
the
finishing
strokes
that
i
did
not
observe
the
stealthy
entrance
for
they
all
walk
like
cats
of
a
red
man
till
a
slender
dark
hand
was
extended
over
my
paper
to
grasp
the
dead
bird
from
which
i
was
copying
and
which
as
rapidly
transferred
it
to
the
side
of
the
painted
one
accompanying
the
act
with
the
deep
guttural
note
of
approbation
the
unmusical
savage
my
guest
then
seated
himself
with
the
utmost
gravity
in
a
directly
fronting
me
and
made
the
modest
demand
that
i
should
paint
a
likeness
of
him
after
the
following
quaint
fashion
moodie
squaw
know
much
make
peter
nogan
toder
day
on
papare
make
jacob
jacob
young
great
hunter
give
much
duck
venison
to
although
i
felt
rather
afraid
of
my
visitor
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
gravity
there
was
such
an
air
of
pompous
about
the
indian
such
a
sublime
look
of
conceit
in
his
grave
vanity
moodie
squaw
can
not
do
everything
she
can
not
paint
young
men
said
i
rising
and
putting
away
my
upon
which
he
kept
his
eye
intently
fixed
with
a
hungry
avaricious
expression
i
thought
it
best
to
place
the
coveted
objects
beyond
his
reach
after
sitting
for
some
time
and
watching
all
my
movements
he
withdrew
with
a
sullen
disappointed
air
this
man
was
handsome
but
his
expression
was
vile
though
he
often
came
to
the
house
i
never
could
reconcile
myself
to
his
countenance
late
one
very
dark
stormy
night
three
indians
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
by
the
kitchen
stove
the
maid
was
frightened
out
of
her
wits
at
the
sight
of
these
strangers
who
were
mohawks
from
the
indian
woods
upon
the
bay
of
quinte
and
they
brought
along
with
them
a
horse
and
cutter
the
night
was
so
stormy
that
after
consulting
our
man
jacob
faithful
as
we
usually
called
him
i
consented
to
grant
their
petition
although
they
were
quite
strangers
and
taller
and
than
our
friends
the
missasaguas
i
was
putting
my
children
to
bed
when
the
girl
came
rushing
in
out
of
breath
the
lord
preserve
us
madam
if
one
of
these
wild
men
has
not
pulled
off
his
trousers
and
is
mending
them
behind
the
stove
and
what
shall
i
do
do
why
stay
with
me
and
leave
the
poor
fellow
to
finish
his
the
simple
girl
had
never
once
thought
of
this
plan
of
pacifying
her
outraged
sense
of
propriety
their
sense
of
hearing
is
so
acute
that
they
can
distinguish
sounds
at
an
incredible
distance
which
can
not
be
detected
by
a
european
at
all
i
myself
witnessed
a
singular
exemplification
of
this
fact
it
was
the
indians
had
pitched
their
tent
or
wigwam
as
usual
in
our
swamp
all
the
males
were
absent
on
a
hunting
expedition
up
the
country
and
had
left
two
women
behind
to
take
care
of
the
camp
and
its
contents
tom
nogan
and
her
children
and
susan
moore
a
young
girl
of
fifteen
and
the
only
truly
beautiful
squaw
i
ever
saw
there
was
something
interesting
about
this
girl
history
as
well
as
her
appearance
her
father
had
been
drowned
during
a
sudden
hurricane
which
swamped
his
canoe
on
stony
lake
and
the
mother
who
witnessed
the
accident
from
the
shore
and
was
near
her
confinement
with
this
child
boldly
swam
out
to
his
assistance
she
reached
the
spot
where
he
sank
and
even
succeeded
in
recovering
the
body
but
it
was
too
late
the
man
was
dead
the
soul
of
an
indian
that
has
been
drowned
is
reckoned
accursed
and
he
is
never
permitted
to
join
his
tribe
on
the
happy
but
his
spirit
haunts
the
lake
or
river
in
which
he
lost
his
life
his
body
is
buried
on
some
lonely
island
which
the
indians
never
pass
without
leaving
a
small
portion
of
food
tobacco
ammunition
to
supply
his
wants
but
he
is
never
interred
with
the
rest
of
his
people
his
children
are
considered
unlucky
and
few
willingly
unite
themselves
to
the
females
of
the
family
lest
a
portion
of
the
father
curse
should
be
visited
on
them
the
orphan
indian
girl
generally
kept
aloof
from
the
rest
and
seemed
so
lonely
and
companionless
that
she
soon
attracted
my
attention
and
sympathy
and
a
hearty
feeling
of
sprang
up
between
us
her
features
were
small
and
regular
her
face
oval
and
her
large
dark
loving
eyes
were
full
of
tenderness
and
sensibility
but
as
bright
and
shy
as
those
of
the
deer
a
rich
vermilion
glow
burnt
upon
her
olive
cheek
and
lips
and
set
off
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
even
and
pearly
teeth
she
was
small
of
stature
with
delicate
little
hands
and
feet
and
her
figure
was
elastic
and
graceful
she
was
a
beautiful
child
of
nature
and
her
indian
name
signified
the
voice
of
angry
poor
girl
she
had
been
a
child
of
grief
and
tears
from
her
birth
her
mother
was
a
mohawk
from
whom
she
in
all
probability
derived
her
superior
personal
attractions
for
they
are
very
far
before
the
missasaguas
in
this
respect
my
friend
and
neighbour
emilia
s
the
wife
of
a
naval
officer
who
lived
about
a
mile
distant
from
me
through
the
bush
had
come
to
spend
the
day
with
me
and
hearing
that
the
indians
were
in
the
swamp
and
the
men
away
we
determined
to
take
a
few
trifles
to
the
camp
in
the
way
of
presents
and
spend
an
hour
in
chatting
with
the
squaws
what
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
it
was
as
light
as
day
the
great
forest
sleeping
tranquilly
beneath
the
cloudless
heavens
not
a
sound
to
disturb
the
deep
repose
of
nature
but
the
whispering
of
the
breeze
which
during
the
most
profound
calm
creeps
through
the
lofty
pine
tops
we
bounded
down
the
steep
bank
to
the
lake
shore
life
is
a
blessing
a
precious
boon
indeed
in
such
an
hour
and
we
felt
happy
in
the
mere
consciousness
of
existence
the
glorious
privilege
of
pouring
out
the
silent
adoration
of
the
heart
to
the
great
father
in
his
universal
temple
on
entering
the
wigwam
which
stood
within
a
few
yards
of
the
clearing
in
the
middle
of
a
thick
group
of
cedars
we
found
tom
alone
with
her
elvish
children
seated
before
the
great
fire
that
burned
in
the
centre
of
the
camp
she
was
busy
boiling
some
bark
in
an
iron
spider
the
little
boys
in
red
flannel
shirts
which
were
their
only
covering
were
tormenting
a
puppy
which
seemed
to
take
their
pinching
and
pummelling
in
good
part
for
it
neither
attempted
to
bark
nor
to
bite
but
like
the
eels
in
the
story
submitted
to
the
infliction
because
it
was
used
to
it
tom
greeted
us
with
a
grin
of
pleasure
and
motioned
to
us
to
sit
down
upon
a
which
with
a
courtesy
so
natural
to
the
indians
she
had
placed
near
her
for
our
accommodation
you
are
all
alone
said
i
glancing
round
the
camp
indian
away
hunting
upper
lakes
come
home
with
much
and
susan
where
is
she
by
and
by
meaning
that
she
was
coming
gone
to
fetch
water
ice
thick
chop
with
axe
take
long
as
she
ceased
speaking
the
old
blanket
that
formed
the
door
of
the
tent
was
withdrawn
and
the
girl
bearing
two
pails
of
water
stood
in
the
open
space
in
the
white
moonlight
the
glow
of
the
fire
streamed
upon
her
dark
floating
locks
danced
in
the
black
glistening
eye
and
gave
a
deeper
blush
to
the
olive
cheek
she
would
have
made
a
beautiful
picture
sir
joshua
reynolds
would
have
rejoiced
in
such
a
model
so
simply
graceful
and
unaffected
the
very
beau
ideal
of
savage
life
and
unadorned
nature
a
smile
of
recognition
passed
between
us
she
put
down
her
burden
beside
tom
and
noiselessly
glided
to
her
seat
we
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
few
words
with
our
favourite
when
the
old
squaw
placing
her
hand
against
her
ear
exclaimed
whist
whist
what
is
it
cried
emilia
and
i
starting
to
our
feet
is
there
any
danger
a
deer
a
deer
in
bush
whispered
the
squaw
seizing
a
rifle
that
stood
in
a
corner
i
hear
sticks
crack
a
great
way
off
stay
here
a
great
way
off
the
animal
must
have
been
for
though
emilia
and
i
listened
at
the
open
door
an
advantage
which
the
squaw
did
not
enjoy
we
could
not
hear
the
least
sound
all
seemed
still
as
death
the
squaw
whistled
to
an
old
hound
and
went
out
did
you
hear
anything
susan
she
smiled
and
nodded
listen
the
dog
has
found
the
the
next
moment
the
discharge
of
a
rifle
and
the
deep
baying
of
the
dog
woke
up
the
sleeping
echoes
of
the
woods
and
the
girl
started
off
to
help
the
old
squaw
to
bring
in
the
game
that
she
had
shot
the
indians
are
great
imitators
and
possess
a
nice
tact
in
adopting
the
customs
and
manners
of
those
with
whom
they
associate
an
indian
is
nature
gentleman
never
familiar
coarse
or
vulgar
if
he
take
a
meal
with
you
he
waits
to
see
how
you
make
use
of
the
implements
on
the
table
and
the
manner
in
which
you
eat
which
he
imitates
with
a
grave
decorum
as
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
the
same
usages
from
childhood
he
never
attempts
to
help
himself
or
demand
more
food
but
waits
patiently
until
you
perceive
what
he
requires
i
was
perfectly
astonished
at
this
innate
politeness
for
it
seems
natural
to
all
the
indians
with
whom
i
have
had
any
dealings
there
was
one
old
indian
who
belonged
to
a
distant
settlement
and
only
visited
our
lakes
occasionally
on
hunting
parties
he
was
a
strange
eccentric
merry
old
fellow
with
a
skin
like
red
mahogany
and
a
wiry
sinewy
frame
that
looked
as
if
it
could
bid
defiance
to
every
change
of
temperature
old
for
such
was
his
significant
name
was
rather
too
fond
of
the
and
when
he
had
taken
a
drop
too
much
he
became
an
unmanageable
wild
beast
he
had
a
great
fancy
for
my
husband
and
never
visited
the
other
indians
without
extending
the
same
favour
to
us
once
upon
a
time
he
broke
the
nipple
of
his
gun
and
moodie
repaired
the
injury
for
him
by
fixing
a
new
one
in
its
place
which
little
kindness
quite
won
the
heart
of
the
old
man
and
he
never
came
to
see
us
without
bringing
an
offering
of
fish
ducks
partridges
or
venison
to
show
his
gratitude
one
warm
september
day
he
made
his
appearance
as
usual
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
great
checked
bundle
fond
of
grapes
said
he
putting
the
said
bundle
into
my
hands
fine
grapes
brought
them
from
island
for
my
friend
squaw
and
glad
of
the
donation
which
i
considered
quite
a
prize
i
hastened
into
the
kitchen
to
untie
the
grapes
and
put
them
into
a
dish
but
imagine
my
disappointment
when
i
found
them
wrapped
up
in
a
soiled
shirt
only
recently
taken
from
the
back
of
the
owner
i
called
moodie
and
begged
him
to
return
his
garment
and
to
thank
him
for
the
grapes
the
mischievous
creature
was
highly
diverted
with
the
circumstance
and
laughed
immoderately
said
he
mrs
moodie
and
the
children
are
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
in
bringing
them
the
grapes
but
how
came
you
to
tie
them
up
in
a
dirty
shirt
dirty
cried
the
old
man
astonished
that
we
should
object
to
the
fruit
on
that
score
it
ought
to
be
clean
it
has
been
washed
often
enough
owgh
you
see
moodie
he
continued
i
have
no
hat
never
wear
hat
want
no
shade
to
my
eyes
love
the
sun
see
all
around
me
up
and
down
much
better
widout
hat
could
not
put
grapes
in
hat
too
large
crush
fruit
juice
run
out
i
had
noting
but
my
shirt
so
i
takes
off
shirt
and
brings
grape
safe
over
the
water
on
my
back
papouse
no
care
for
dirty
shirt
their
bellies
have
no
in
spite
of
this
eloquent
harangue
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
use
the
grapes
ripe
and
tempting
as
they
looked
or
give
them
to
the
children
w
and
his
wife
happening
to
step
in
at
that
moment
fell
into
such
an
ecstasy
at
the
sight
of
the
grapes
that
as
they
were
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
circumstance
of
the
shirt
i
very
generously
gratified
their
wishes
by
presenting
them
with
the
contents
of
the
large
dish
and
they
never
ate
a
bit
less
sweet
for
the
novel
mode
in
which
they
were
conveyed
to
me
the
indians
under
their
quiet
exterior
possess
a
deal
of
humour
they
have
significant
names
for
everything
and
a
nickname
for
every
one
and
some
of
the
latter
are
laughably
appropriate
a
fat
pompous
ostentatious
settler
in
our
neighbourhood
they
called
muckakee
the
bull
another
rather
a
fine
young
man
but
with
a
very
red
face
they
named
segoskee
the
rising
wood
who
had
a
farm
above
ours
was
a
remarkably
slender
young
man
and
to
him
they
gave
the
appellation
of
metiz
thin
a
woman
that
occasionally
worked
for
me
had
a
disagreeable
squint
she
was
known
in
indian
by
the
name
of
sachabo
cross
a
gentleman
with
a
very
large
nose
was
choojas
big
or
ugly
my
little
addie
who
was
a
fair
lovely
creature
they
viewed
with
great
approbation
and
called
anoonk
a
star
while
the
rosy
katie
was
nogesigook
the
northern
as
to
me
i
was
nonocosiqui
a
a
ridiculous
name
for
a
tall
woman
but
it
had
reference
to
the
delight
i
took
in
painting
birds
my
friend
emilia
was
blue
cloud
my
little
donald
frozen
face
young
c
the
woodpecker
from
the
colour
of
his
hair
my
brother
chippewa
and
the
he
was
an
especial
favourite
among
them
the
indians
are
often
made
a
prey
of
and
cheated
by
the
unprincipled
settlers
who
think
it
no
crime
to
overreach
a
one
anecdote
will
fully
illustrate
this
fact
a
young
squaw
who
was
near
becoming
a
mother
stopped
at
a
settler
house
to
rest
herself
the
woman
of
the
house
who
was
irish
was
peeling
for
dinner
some
large
white
turnips
which
her
husband
had
grown
in
their
garden
the
indian
had
never
seen
a
turnip
before
and
the
appearance
of
the
firm
white
juicy
root
gave
her
such
a
keen
craving
to
taste
it
that
she
very
earnestly
begged
for
a
small
piece
to
eat
she
had
purchased
at
peterborough
a
large
bowl
of
a
very
handsome
pattern
or
perhaps
got
it
at
the
store
in
exchange
for
the
worth
of
which
might
be
if
the
poor
squaw
longed
for
the
turnip
the
value
of
which
could
scarcely
reach
a
copper
the
covetous
european
had
fixed
as
longing
a
glance
upon
the
china
bowl
and
she
was
determined
to
gratify
her
avaricious
desire
and
obtain
it
on
the
most
easy
terms
she
told
the
squaw
with
some
disdain
that
her
man
did
not
grow
turnips
to
give
away
to
injuns
but
she
would
sell
her
one
the
squaw
offered
her
four
coppers
all
the
change
she
had
about
her
this
the
woman
refused
with
contempt
she
then
proffered
a
basket
but
that
was
not
sufficient
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
the
bowl
the
indian
demurred
but
opposition
had
only
increased
her
craving
for
the
turnip
in
a
tenfold
degree
and
after
a
short
mental
struggle
in
which
the
animal
propensity
overcame
the
warnings
of
prudence
the
squaw
gave
up
the
bowl
and
received
in
return
one
turnip
the
daughter
of
this
woman
told
me
this
anecdote
of
her
mother
as
a
very
clever
thing
what
ideas
some
people
have
of
moral
justice
i
have
said
before
that
the
indian
never
forgets
a
kindness
we
had
a
thousand
proofs
of
this
when
overtaken
by
misfortune
and
withering
beneath
the
iron
grasp
of
poverty
we
could
scarcely
obtain
bread
for
ourselves
and
our
little
ones
then
it
was
that
the
truth
of
the
eastern
proverb
was
brought
home
to
our
hearts
and
the
goodness
of
god
fully
manifested
towards
us
cast
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
and
thou
shalt
find
it
after
many
during
better
times
we
had
treated
these
poor
savages
with
kindness
and
liberality
and
when
dearer
friends
looked
coldly
upon
us
they
never
forsook
us
for
many
a
good
meal
i
have
been
indebted
to
them
when
i
had
nothing
to
give
in
return
when
the
pantry
was
empty
and
the
hearthstone
growing
cold
as
they
term
the
want
of
provisions
to
cook
at
it
and
their
delicacy
in
conferring
these
favours
was
not
the
least
admirable
part
of
their
conduct
john
nogan
who
was
much
attached
to
us
would
bring
a
fine
bunch
of
ducks
and
drop
them
at
my
feet
for
the
papouse
or
leave
a
large
muskinonge
on
the
sill
of
the
door
or
place
a
quarter
of
venison
just
within
it
and
slip
away
without
saying
a
word
thinking
that
receiving
a
present
from
a
poor
indian
might
hurt
our
feelings
and
he
would
spare
us
the
mortification
of
returning
thanks
often
have
i
grieved
that
people
with
such
generous
impulses
should
be
degraded
and
corrupted
by
civilised
men
that
a
mysterious
destiny
involves
and
hangs
over
them
pressing
them
back
into
the
wilderness
and
slowly
and
surely
sweeping
them
from
the
earth
their
ideas
of
christianity
appeared
to
me
vague
and
unsatisfactory
they
will
tell
you
that
christ
died
for
men
and
that
he
is
the
saviour
of
the
world
but
they
do
not
seem
to
comprehend
the
spiritual
character
of
christianity
nor
the
full
extent
of
the
requirements
and
application
of
the
law
of
christian
love
these
imperfect
views
may
not
be
entertained
by
all
christian
indians
but
they
were
very
common
amongst
those
with
whom
i
conversed
their
ignorance
upon
theological
as
well
as
upon
other
subjects
is
of
course
extreme
one
indian
asked
me
very
innocently
if
i
came
from
the
land
where
christ
was
born
and
if
i
had
ever
seen
jesus
they
always
mention
the
name
of
the
persons
in
the
trinity
with
great
reverence
they
are
a
highly
imaginative
people
the
practical
meaning
of
their
names
and
their
intense
admiration
for
the
beauties
of
nature
are
proof
of
this
nothing
escapes
their
observing
eyes
there
is
not
a
flower
that
blooms
in
the
wilderness
a
bird
that
cuts
the
air
with
its
wings
a
beast
that
roams
the
wood
a
fish
that
stems
the
water
or
the
most
minute
insect
that
sports
in
the
sunbeams
but
it
has
an
indian
name
to
illustrate
its
peculiar
habits
and
qualities
some
of
their
words
convey
the
direct
meaning
of
the
thing
implied
thus
to
sneeze
is
the
very
sound
of
that
act
to
churn
gives
the
noise
made
by
the
dashing
of
the
cream
from
side
to
side
and
many
others
they
believe
in
supernatural
appearances
in
spirits
of
the
earth
the
air
the
waters
the
latter
they
consider
evil
and
propitiate
before
undertaking
a
long
voyage
by
throwing
small
portions
of
bread
meat
tobacco
and
gunpowder
into
the
water
when
an
indian
loses
one
of
his
children
he
must
keep
a
strict
fast
for
three
days
abstaining
from
food
of
any
kind
a
hunter
of
the
name
of
young
told
me
a
curious
story
of
their
rigid
observance
of
this
strange
rite
they
had
a
chief
he
said
a
few
years
ago
whom
they
called
jack
whether
in
derision
i
can
not
tell
for
he
was
one
of
the
ugliest
indians
i
ever
saw
the
scarlet
fever
got
into
the
camp
a
terrible
disease
in
this
country
and
doubly
terrible
to
those
poor
creatures
who
do
know
how
to
treat
it
his
eldest
daughter
died
the
chief
had
fasted
two
days
when
i
met
him
in
the
bush
i
did
not
know
what
had
happened
but
i
opened
my
wallet
for
i
was
on
a
hunting
expedition
and
offered
him
some
bread
and
dried
venison
he
looked
at
me
reproachfully
white
men
eat
bread
the
first
night
their
papouse
is
laid
in
the
earth
i
then
knew
the
cause
of
his
depression
and
left
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
of
his
fast
another
child
died
of
the
fever
he
had
now
to
accomplish
three
more
days
without
tasting
food
it
was
too
much
even
for
an
indian
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
he
was
so
pressed
by
ravenous
hunger
that
he
stole
into
the
woods
caught
a
and
devoured
it
alive
he
imagined
himself
alone
but
one
of
his
people
suspecting
his
intention
had
followed
him
unperceived
to
the
bush
the
act
he
had
just
committed
was
a
hideous
crime
in
their
eyes
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
camp
was
in
an
uproar
the
chief
fled
for
protection
to
house
when
the
hunter
demanded
the
cause
of
his
alarm
he
gave
for
answer
there
are
plenty
of
flies
at
my
house
to
avoid
their
stings
i
came
to
it
required
all
the
eloquence
of
young
who
enjoyed
much
popularity
among
them
to
reconcile
the
rebellious
tribe
to
their
chief
they
are
very
skilful
in
their
treatment
of
wounds
and
many
diseases
their
knowledge
of
the
medicinal
qualities
of
their
plants
and
herbs
is
very
great
they
make
excellent
poultices
from
the
bark
of
the
bass
and
the
slippery
elm
they
use
several
native
plants
in
their
dyeing
of
baskets
and
porcupine
quills
the
inner
bark
of
the
simply
boiled
in
water
makes
a
beautiful
red
from
the
root
of
the
black
briony
they
obtain
a
fine
salve
for
sores
and
extract
a
rich
yellow
dye
the
inner
bark
of
the
root
of
the
sumach
roasted
and
reduced
to
powder
is
a
good
remedy
for
the
ague
a
teaspoonful
given
between
the
hot
and
cold
fit
they
scrape
the
fine
white
powder
from
the
large
fungus
that
grows
upon
the
bark
of
the
pine
into
whiskey
and
take
it
for
violent
pains
in
the
stomach
the
taste
of
this
powder
strongly
reminded
me
of
quinine
i
have
read
much
of
the
excellence
of
indian
cookery
but
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
taste
anything
prepared
in
their
dirty
wigwams
i
remember
being
highly
amused
in
watching
the
preparation
of
a
mess
which
might
have
been
called
the
indian
it
consisted
of
a
strange
mixture
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
all
boiled
together
in
the
same
vessel
ducks
partridges
muskinonge
venison
and
muskrats
formed
a
part
of
this
delectable
compound
these
were
literally
smothered
in
onions
potatoes
and
turnips
which
they
had
procured
from
me
they
very
hospitably
offered
me
a
dishful
of
the
odious
mixture
which
the
odour
of
the
muskrats
rendered
everything
but
savoury
but
i
declined
simply
stating
that
i
was
not
hungry
my
little
boy
tasted
it
but
quickly
left
the
camp
to
conceal
the
effect
it
produced
upon
him
their
method
of
broiling
fish
however
is
excellent
they
take
a
fish
just
fresh
out
of
the
water
cut
out
the
entrails
and
without
removing
the
scales
wash
it
clean
dry
it
in
a
cloth
or
in
grass
and
cover
it
all
over
with
clear
hot
ashes
when
the
flesh
will
part
from
the
bone
they
draw
it
out
of
the
ashes
strip
off
the
skin
and
it
is
fit
for
the
table
of
the
most
fastidious
epicure
the
deplorable
want
of
chastity
that
exists
among
the
indian
women
of
this
tribe
seems
to
have
been
more
the
result
of
their
intercourse
with
the
settlers
in
the
country
than
from
any
previous
disposition
to
this
vice
the
jealousy
of
their
husbands
has
often
been
exercised
in
a
terrible
manner
against
the
offending
squaws
but
this
has
not
happened
of
late
years
the
men
wink
at
these
derelictions
in
their
wives
and
share
with
them
the
price
of
their
shame
the
mixture
of
european
blood
adds
greatly
to
the
physical
beauty
of
the
but
produces
a
sad
from
the
original
integrity
of
the
indian
character
the
is
generally
a
lying
vicious
rogue
possessing
the
worst
qualities
of
both
parents
in
an
eminent
degree
we
have
many
of
these
in
the
penitentiary
for
crimes
of
the
blackest
dye
the
skill
of
the
indian
in
procuring
his
game
either
by
land
or
water
has
been
too
well
described
by
better
writers
than
i
could
ever
hope
to
be
to
need
any
illustration
from
my
pen
and
i
will
close
this
long
chapter
with
a
droll
anecdote
which
is
told
of
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
the
early
loss
of
his
hair
obliged
to
procure
the
substitute
of
a
wig
this
was
such
a
good
imitation
of
nature
that
none
but
his
intimate
friends
and
neighbours
were
aware
of
the
fact
it
happened
that
he
had
had
some
quarrel
with
an
indian
which
had
to
be
settled
in
one
of
the
petty
courts
the
case
was
decided
in
favour
of
which
so
aggrieved
the
savage
who
considered
himself
the
injured
party
that
he
sprang
upon
him
with
a
furious
yell
tomahawk
in
hand
with
the
intention
of
depriving
him
of
his
scalp
he
twisted
his
hand
in
the
looks
which
adorned
the
cranium
of
his
adversary
when
horror
of
horrors
the
treacherous
wig
came
off
in
his
hand
owgh
owgh
exclaimed
the
affrighted
savage
flinging
it
from
him
and
rushing
from
the
court
as
if
he
had
been
bitten
by
a
rattlesnake
his
sudden
exit
was
followed
by
peals
of
laughter
from
the
crowd
while
coolly
picked
up
his
wig
and
drily
remarked
that
it
had
saved
his
head

burning
the
fallow
there
is
a
hollow
roaring
in
the
air
the
hideous
hissing
of
ten
thousand
flames
that
from
the
centre
of
yon
sable
cloud
leap
madly
up
like
serpents
in
the
dark
shaking
their
arrowy
tongues
at
nature
heart
it
is
not
my
intention
to
give
a
regular
history
of
our
residence
in
the
bush
but
merely
to
present
to
my
readers
such
events
as
may
serve
to
illustrate
a
life
in
the
woods
the
winter
and
spring
of
had
passed
away
the
latter
was
uncommonly
cold
and
backward
so
much
so
that
we
had
a
very
heavy
fall
of
snow
upon
the
and
of
may
and
several
gentlemen
drove
down
to
cobourg
in
a
sleigh
the
snow
lying
upon
the
ground
to
the
depth
of
several
inches
a
late
cold
spring
in
canada
is
generally
succeeded
by
a
burning
hot
summer
and
the
summer
of
was
the
hottest
i
ever
remember
no
rain
fell
upon
the
earth
for
many
weeks
till
nature
drooped
and
withered
beneath
one
bright
blaze
of
sunlight
and
the
ague
and
fever
in
the
woods
and
the
cholera
in
the
large
towns
and
cities
spread
death
and
sickness
through
the
country
moodie
had
made
during
the
winter
a
large
clearing
of
twenty
acres
around
the
house
the
progress
of
the
workmen
had
been
watched
by
me
with
the
keenest
interest
every
tree
that
reached
the
ground
opened
a
wider
gap
in
the
dark
wood
giving
us
a
broader
ray
of
light
and
a
clearer
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
but
when
the
dark
fronting
the
house
fell
beneath
the
strokes
of
the
axe
and
we
got
a
first
view
of
the
lake
my
joy
was
complete
a
new
and
beautiful
object
was
now
constantly
before
me
which
gave
me
the
greatest
pleasure
by
night
and
day
in
sunshine
or
in
storm
water
is
always
the
most
sublime
feature
in
a
landscape
and
no
view
can
be
truly
grand
in
which
it
is
wanting
from
a
child
it
always
had
the
most
powerful
effect
upon
my
mind
from
the
great
ocean
rolling
in
majesty
to
the
tinkling
forest
rill
hidden
by
the
flowers
and
rushes
along
its
banks
half
the
solitude
of
my
forest
home
vanished
when
the
lake
unveiled
its
bright
face
to
the
blue
heavens
and
i
saw
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
waving
trees
reflected
there
i
would
sit
for
hours
at
the
window
as
the
shades
of
evening
deepened
round
me
watching
the
massy
foliage
of
the
forests
pictured
in
the
waters
till
fancy
transported
me
back
to
england
and
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
were
sounding
in
my
ears
it
was
long
very
long
before
i
could
discipline
my
mind
to
learn
and
practice
all
the
menial
employments
which
are
necessary
in
a
good
settler
wife
the
total
absence
of
trees
about
the
doors
in
all
new
settlements
had
always
puzzled
me
in
a
country
where
the
intense
heat
of
summer
seems
to
demand
all
the
shade
that
can
be
procured
my
husband
had
left
several
beautiful
the
most
picturesque
tree
in
the
country
near
our
dwelling
but
alas
the
first
high
gale
prostrated
all
my
fine
trees
and
left
our
log
cottage
entirely
exposed
to
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
the
confusion
of
an
uncleared
fallow
spread
around
us
on
every
side
huge
trunks
of
trees
and
piles
of
brush
gave
a
littered
and
uncomfortable
appearance
to
the
locality
and
as
the
weather
had
been
very
dry
for
some
weeks
i
heard
my
husband
daily
talking
with
his
choppers
as
to
the
expediency
of
firing
the
fallow
they
still
urged
him
to
wait
a
little
longer
until
he
could
get
a
good
breeze
to
carry
the
fire
well
through
the
brush
business
called
him
suddenly
to
toronto
but
he
left
a
strict
charge
with
old
thomas
and
his
sons
who
were
engaged
in
the
job
by
no
means
to
attempt
to
burn
it
off
until
he
returned
as
he
wished
to
be
upon
the
premises
himself
in
case
of
any
danger
he
had
previously
burnt
all
the
heaps
immediately
about
the
doors
while
he
was
absent
old
thomas
and
his
second
son
fell
sick
with
the
ague
and
went
home
to
their
own
township
leaving
john
a
surly
obstinate
young
man
in
charge
of
the
shanty
where
they
slept
and
kept
their
tools
and
provisions
monaghan
i
had
sent
to
fetch
up
my
three
cows
as
the
children
were
languishing
for
milk
and
mary
and
i
remained
alone
in
the
house
with
the
little
ones
the
day
was
sultry
and
towards
noon
a
strong
wind
sprang
up
that
roared
in
the
pine
tops
like
the
dashing
of
distant
billows
but
without
in
the
least
degree
abating
the
heat
the
children
were
lying
listlessly
upon
the
floor
for
coolness
and
the
girl
and
i
were
finishing
when
mary
suddenly
exclaimed
bless
us
mistress
what
a
smoke
i
ran
immediately
to
the
door
but
was
not
able
to
distinguish
ten
yards
before
me
the
swamp
immediately
below
us
was
on
fire
and
the
heavy
wind
was
driving
a
dense
black
cloud
of
smoke
directly
towards
us
what
can
this
mean
i
cried
who
can
have
set
fire
to
the
fallow
as
i
ceased
speaking
john
thomas
stood
pale
and
trembling
before
me
john
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
fire
oh
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
it
was
i
set
fire
to
it
and
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
the
world
if
i
had
not
done
what
is
the
danger
oh
i
terribly
afear
that
we
shall
all
be
burnt
up
said
the
fellow
beginning
to
whimper
why
did
you
run
such
a
risk
and
your
master
from
home
and
no
one
on
the
place
to
render
the
least
assistance
i
did
it
for
the
best
blubbered
the
lad
what
shall
we
do
why
we
must
get
out
of
it
as
fast
as
we
can
and
leave
the
house
to
its
we
ca
get
out
said
the
man
in
a
low
hollow
tone
which
seemed
the
concentration
of
fear
i
would
have
got
out
of
it
if
i
could
but
just
step
to
the
back
door
and
i
had
not
felt
the
least
alarm
up
to
this
minute
i
had
never
seen
a
fallow
burnt
but
i
had
heard
of
it
as
a
thing
of
such
common
occurrence
that
i
had
never
connected
with
it
any
idea
of
danger
judge
then
my
surprise
my
horror
when
on
going
to
the
back
door
i
saw
that
the
fellow
to
make
sure
of
his
work
had
fired
the
field
in
fifty
different
places
behind
before
on
every
side
we
were
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
fire
burning
furiously
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
and
cutting
off
all
possibility
of
retreat
for
could
we
have
found
an
opening
through
the
burning
heaps
we
could
not
have
seen
our
way
through
the
dense
canopy
of
smoke
and
buried
as
we
were
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
no
one
could
discover
our
situation
till
we
were
beyond
the
reach
of
help
i
closed
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
parlour
fear
was
knocking
loudly
at
my
heart
for
our
utter
helplessness
annihilated
all
hope
of
being
able
to
effect
our
escape
i
felt
stupefied
the
girl
sat
upon
the
floor
by
the
children
who
unconscious
of
the
peril
that
hung
over
them
had
both
fallen
asleep
she
was
silently
weeping
while
the
fool
who
had
caused
the
mischief
was
crying
aloud
a
strange
calm
succeeded
my
first
alarm
tears
and
lamentations
were
useless
a
horrible
death
was
impending
over
us
and
yet
i
could
not
believe
that
we
were
to
die
i
sat
down
upon
the
step
of
the
door
and
watched
the
awful
scene
in
silence
the
fire
was
raging
in
the
immediately
below
the
ridge
on
which
the
house
stood
and
it
presented
a
spectacle
truly
appalling
from
out
the
dense
folds
of
a
canopy
of
black
smoke
the
blackest
i
ever
saw
leaped
up
continually
red
forks
of
lurid
flame
as
high
as
the
tree
tops
igniting
the
branches
of
a
group
of
tall
pines
that
had
been
left
standing
for
a
deep
gloom
blotted
out
the
heavens
from
our
sight
the
air
was
filled
with
fiery
particles
which
floated
even
to
the
while
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
the
flames
might
have
been
heard
at
a
great
distance
could
we
have
reached
the
lake
shore
where
several
canoes
were
moored
at
the
landing
by
launching
out
into
the
water
we
should
have
been
in
perfect
safety
but
to
attain
this
object
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
this
mimic
hell
and
not
a
bird
could
have
flown
over
it
with
unscorched
wings
there
was
no
hope
in
that
quarter
for
could
we
have
escaped
the
flames
we
should
have
been
blinded
and
choked
by
the
thick
black
resinous
smoke
the
fierce
wind
drove
the
flames
at
the
sides
and
back
of
the
house
up
the
clearing
and
our
passage
to
the
road
or
to
the
forest
on
the
right
and
left
was
entirely
obstructed
by
a
sea
of
flames
our
only
ark
of
safety
was
the
house
so
long
as
it
remained
untouched
by
the
consuming
element
i
turned
to
young
thomas
and
asked
him
how
long
he
thought
that
would
be
when
the
fire
clears
this
little
ridge
in
front
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
then
or
we
must
all
go
can
not
you
john
try
and
make
your
escape
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
us
and
the
poor
children
my
eye
fell
upon
the
sleeping
angels
locked
peacefully
in
each
other
arms
and
my
tears
flowed
for
the
first
time
mary
the
looked
piteously
up
in
my
face
the
good
faithful
creature
had
not
uttered
one
word
of
complaint
but
now
she
faltered
forth
the
dear
precious
lambs
oh
such
a
death
i
threw
myself
down
upon
the
floor
beside
them
and
pressed
them
alternately
to
my
heart
while
inwardly
i
thanked
god
that
they
were
asleep
unconscious
of
danger
and
unable
by
their
childish
cries
to
distract
our
attention
from
adopting
any
plan
which
might
offer
to
effect
their
escape
the
heat
soon
became
suffocating
we
were
parched
with
thirst
and
there
was
not
a
drop
of
water
in
the
house
and
none
to
be
procured
nearer
than
the
lake
i
turned
once
more
to
the
door
hoping
that
a
passage
might
have
been
burnt
through
to
the
water
i
saw
nothing
but
a
dense
cloud
of
fire
and
smoke
could
hear
nothing
but
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
the
flames
which
were
gaining
so
fast
upon
us
that
i
felt
their
scorching
breath
in
my
face
ah
thought
i
and
it
was
a
most
bitter
thought
what
will
my
beloved
husband
say
when
he
returns
and
finds
that
his
poor
susy
and
his
dear
girls
have
perished
in
this
miserable
manner
but
god
can
save
us
the
thought
had
scarcely
found
a
voice
in
my
heart
before
the
wind
rose
to
a
hurricane
scattering
the
flames
on
all
sides
into
a
tempest
of
burning
billows
i
buried
my
head
in
my
apron
for
i
thought
that
our
time
was
come
and
that
all
was
lost
when
a
most
terrific
crash
of
thunder
burst
over
our
heads
and
like
the
breaking
of
a
down
came
the
rushing
torrent
of
rain
which
had
been
pent
up
for
so
many
weeks
in
a
few
minutes
the
was
all
afloat
and
the
fire
effectually
checked
the
storm
which
unnoticed
by
us
had
been
gathering
all
day
and
which
was
the
only
one
of
any
note
we
had
that
summer
continued
to
rage
all
night
and
before
morning
had
quite
subdued
the
cruel
enemy
whose
approach
we
had
viewed
with
such
dread
the
imminent
danger
in
which
we
had
been
placed
struck
me
more
forcibly
after
it
was
past
than
at
the
time
and
both
the
girl
and
myself
sank
upon
our
knees
and
lifted
up
our
hearts
in
humble
thanksgiving
to
that
god
who
had
saved
us
by
an
act
of
his
providence
from
an
awful
and
sudden
death
when
all
hope
from
human
assistance
was
lost
his
hand
was
mercifully
stretched
forth
making
his
strength
more
perfectly
manifested
in
our
weakness
he
is
their
stay
when
earthly
help
is
lost
the
light
and
anchor
of
the
there
was
one
person
unknown
to
us
who
had
watched
the
progress
of
that
rash
blaze
and
had
even
brought
his
canoe
to
the
landing
in
the
hope
of
us
getting
off
this
was
an
irish
pensioner
named
dunn
who
had
cleared
a
few
acres
on
his
government
grant
and
had
built
a
shanty
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
faith
madam
an
i
thought
the
captain
was
stark
staring
mad
to
fire
his
fallow
on
such
a
windy
day
and
that
blowing
right
from
the
lake
to
the
house
when
old
wittals
came
in
and
towld
us
that
the
masther
was
not
to
the
fore
but
only
one
lad
an
the
wife
the
chilther
at
home
thinks
i
there
no
time
to
be
lost
or
the
crathurs
will
be
burnt
up
intirely
we
started
instanther
but
by
jove
we
were
too
late
the
swamp
was
all
in
a
blaze
when
we
got
to
the
landing
and
you
might
as
well
have
thried
to
get
to
heaven
by
passing
through
the
other
this
was
the
eloquent
harangue
with
which
the
honest
creature
informed
me
the
next
morning
of
the
efforts
he
had
made
to
save
us
and
the
interest
he
had
felt
in
our
critical
situation
i
felt
comforted
for
my
past
anxiety
by
knowing
that
one
human
being
however
humble
had
sympathised
in
our
probable
fate
while
the
providential
manner
in
which
we
had
been
rescued
will
ever
remain
a
theme
of
wonder
and
gratitude
the
next
evening
brought
the
return
of
my
husband
who
listened
to
the
tale
of
our
escape
with
a
pale
and
disturbed
countenance
not
a
little
thankful
to
find
his
wife
and
children
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
for
a
long
time
after
the
burning
of
that
fallow
it
haunted
me
in
my
dreams
i
would
awake
with
a
start
imagining
myself
fighting
with
the
flames
and
endeavouring
to
carry
my
little
children
through
them
to
the
top
of
the
clearing
when
invariably
their
garments
and
my
own
took
fire
just
as
i
was
within
reach
of
a
place
of
safety
the
forgotten
dream
ere
one
ruddy
streak
of
light
glimmer
the
distant
height
kindling
with
its
living
beam
frowning
wood
and
cold
grey
stream
i
awoke
with
sudden
start
clammy
brow
and
beating
heart
trembling
limbs
convulsed
and
chill
conscious
of
some
mighty
ill
yet
unable
to
recall
sights
that
did
my
sense
appal
sounds
that
thrill
my
sleeping
ear
with
unutterable
fear
forms
that
to
my
sleeping
eye
presented
some
strange
phantasy
shadowy
spectral
and
sublime
that
glance
upon
the
sons
of
time
at
moments
when
the
mind
yields
reason
to
mysterious
thought
and
night
and
solitude
in
vain
bind
the
free
spirit
in
their
chain
such
the
vision
wild
that
on
tortur
brain
and
heaving
chest
but
sight
and
sound
alike
are
gone
i
woke
and
found
myself
alone
with
choking
sob
and
stifled
scream
to
bless
my
god
was
but
a
dream
to
smooth
my
damp
and
stiffen
hair
and
murmur
out
the
saviour
prayer
the
first
to
grateful
memory
brought
the
first
a
gentle
mother
taught
when
bending
her
children
bed
she
bade
good
angels
guard
my
head
then
paused
with
tearful
eyes
and
smiled
on
the
calm
slumbers
of
her
child
as
god
himself
had
heard
her
prayer
and
holy
angels
worshipped
there
chapter
xvii
our
there
was
a
man
in
our
town
in
our
town
in
our
town
there
was
a
man
in
our
town
he
made
a
and
he
bought
lots
of
whiskey
to
make
the
loggers
frisky
to
make
the
loggers
frisky
at
his
the
devil
sat
on
a
log
heap
a
log
heap
a
log
heap
a
red
hot
burning
log
heap
at
the
bee
and
there
was
lots
of
swearing
of
boasting
and
of
daring
of
fighting
and
of
tearing
at
that
logging
bee
a
followed
the
burning
of
the
fallow
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
bush
where
hands
are
few
and
labour
commands
an
enormous
rate
of
wages
these
gatherings
are
considered
indispensable
and
much
has
been
written
in
their
praise
but
to
me
they
present
the
most
disgusting
picture
of
a
bush
life
they
are
noisy
riotous
drunken
meetings
often
terminating
in
violent
quarrels
sometimes
even
in
bloodshed
accidents
of
the
most
serious
nature
often
occur
and
very
little
work
is
done
when
we
consider
the
number
of
hands
employed
and
the
great
consumption
of
food
and
liquor
i
am
certain
in
our
case
had
we
hired
with
the
money
expended
in
providing
for
the
bee
two
or
three
industrious
men
we
should
have
got
through
twice
as
much
work
and
have
had
it
done
well
and
have
been
the
gainers
in
the
end
people
in
the
woods
have
a
craze
for
giving
and
going
to
bees
and
run
to
them
with
as
much
eagerness
as
a
peasant
runs
to
a
or
a
fair
plenty
of
strong
drink
and
excitement
making
the
chief
attraction
of
a
bee
in
raising
a
house
or
barn
a
bee
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
necessary
evil
but
these
gatherings
are
generally
conducted
in
a
more
orderly
manner
than
those
for
logging
fewer
hands
are
required
and
they
are
generally
under
the
control
of
the
carpenter
who
puts
up
the
frame
and
if
they
get
drunk
during
the
raising
they
are
liable
to
meet
with
very
serious
accidents
men
gentle
and
simple
were
invited
to
our
bee
and
the
maid
and
i
were
engaged
for
two
days
preceding
the
important
one
in
baking
and
cooking
for
the
entertainment
of
our
guests
when
i
looked
at
the
quantity
of
food
we
had
prepared
i
thought
it
could
never
be
all
eaten
even
by
men
it
was
a
burning
hot
day
towards
the
end
of
july
when
our
loggers
began
to
come
in
and
the
gee
and
ha
to
encourage
the
oxen
resounded
on
every
side
there
was
my
brother
s
with
his
frank
english
face
a
host
in
himself
lieutenant
in
his
blouse
wide
white
trousers
and
red
sash
his
broad
straw
hat
shading
a
dark
manly
face
that
would
have
been
a
splendid
property
for
a
bandit
chief
the
four
gay
reckless
idle
sons
of
famous
at
any
spree
but
incapable
of
the
least
mental
or
physical
exertion
who
considered
hunting
and
fishing
as
the
sole
aim
and
object
of
life
these
young
men
rendered
very
little
assistance
themselves
and
their
example
deterred
others
who
were
inclined
to
work
there
were
the
two
r
s
who
came
to
work
and
to
make
others
work
my
good
who
had
volunteered
to
be
the
grog
boss
and
a
host
of
other
settlers
among
whom
i
recognised
moodie
old
acquaintance
dan
simpson
with
his
lank
red
hair
and
freckled
face
the
youngs
the
hunters
with
their
round
black
curly
heads
and
rich
irish
brogue
poor
c
with
his
long
spare
consumptive
figure
and
thin
sickly
face
poor
fellow
he
has
long
since
been
gathered
to
his
rest
there
was
the
ruffian
squatter
p
from
clear
lake
the
dread
of
all
honest
men
the
brutal
m
who
treated
oxen
as
if
they
had
been
logs
by
beating
them
with
handspikes
and
there
was
old
wittals
with
his
low
forehead
and
long
nose
a
living
witness
of
the
truth
of
phrenology
if
his
large
organ
of
acquisitiveness
and
his
want
of
consciousness
could
be
taken
in
evidence
yet
in
spite
of
his
derelictions
from
honesty
he
was
a
man
who
if
he
cheated
you
in
a
bargain
or
took
away
some
useful
article
in
mistake
from
your
homestead
never
wronged
his
employer
in
his
day
work
he
was
a
curious
sample
of
cunning
and
simplicity
quite
a
character
in
his
way
and
the
largest
eater
i
ever
chanced
to
know
from
this
ravenous
propensity
for
he
eat
his
food
like
a
famished
wolf
he
had
obtained
his
singular
name
of
during
the
first
year
of
his
settlement
in
the
bush
with
a
very
large
family
to
provide
for
he
had
been
often
in
want
of
food
one
day
he
came
to
my
brother
with
a
very
long
face
mr
s
i
no
beggar
but
i
be
obliged
to
you
for
a
loaf
of
bread
i
declare
to
you
on
my
honour
that
i
have
not
had
a
bit
of
wittals
to
dewour
for
two
whole
he
came
to
the
right
person
with
his
petition
s
with
a
liberal
hand
relieved
his
wants
but
he
entailed
upon
him
the
name
of
old
wittals
as
part
payment
his
daughter
who
was
a
very
pretty
girl
had
stolen
a
march
upon
him
into
the
wood
with
a
lad
whom
he
by
no
means
regarded
with
a
favourable
eye
when
she
returned
the
old
man
confronted
her
and
her
lover
with
this
threat
which
i
suppose
he
considered
the
most
awful
punishment
that
he
could
devise
march
into
the
house
madam
maria
and
if
ever
i
catch
you
with
that
scamp
again
i
tie
you
up
to
a
stump
all
day
and
give
you
no
i
was
greatly
amused
by
overhearing
a
dialogue
between
old
wittals
and
one
of
his
youngest
sons
a
sharp
boy
who
had
lost
one
of
his
eyes
but
the
remaining
orb
looked
as
if
it
could
see
all
ways
at
once
i
say
sol
how
came
you
to
tell
that
tarnation
tearing
lie
to
s
yesterday
did
you
expect
that
you
catch
a
good
wallopping
for
the
like
of
that
lying
may
be
excusable
in
a
man
but
is
a
terrible
bad
habit
for
a
lor
father
that
wor
a
lie
i
told
s
our
cow
wor
in
his
peas
nor
more
she
wor
she
was
in
his
but
she
was
in
the
peas
all
night
that
wor
nothing
to
me
she
wor
in
just
then
sure
i
wo
get
a
licking
for
that
no
no
you
are
a
good
boy
but
mind
what
i
tell
you
and
bring
me
into
a
scrape
with
any
of
your
real
prevarication
the
worst
of
falsehoods
was
a
virtue
in
his
eyes
so
much
for
the
old
man
morality
monaghan
was
in
his
glory
prepared
to
work
or
fight
whichever
should
come
uppermost
and
there
was
old
thomas
and
his
sons
the
contractors
for
the
clearing
to
expedite
whose
movements
the
bee
was
called
old
thomas
was
a
very
ambitious
man
in
his
way
though
he
did
not
know
a
from
b
he
took
into
his
head
that
he
had
received
a
call
from
heaven
to
convert
the
heathen
in
the
wilderness
and
every
sunday
he
held
a
meeting
in
our
loggers
shanty
for
the
purpose
of
awakening
sinners
and
bringing
over
injun
pagans
to
the
true
faith
his
method
of
accomplishing
this
object
was
very
ingenious
he
got
his
wife
peggy
or
my
paggy
as
he
called
her
to
read
aloud
to
him
a
text
from
the
bible
until
he
knew
it
by
heart
and
he
had
as
he
said
truly
a
good
remembrancer
and
never
heard
a
striking
sermon
but
he
retained
the
most
important
passages
and
retailed
them
secondhand
to
his
bush
audience
i
must
say
that
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
old
eloquence
when
i
went
one
sunday
over
to
the
shanty
to
hear
him
preach
several
wild
young
fellows
had
come
on
purpose
to
make
fun
of
him
but
his
discourse
which
was
upon
the
text
we
shall
all
meet
before
the
of
christ
was
rather
too
serious
a
subject
to
turn
into
a
jest
with
even
old
thomas
for
the
preacher
all
went
on
very
well
until
the
old
man
gave
out
a
hymn
and
led
off
in
such
a
loud
discordant
voice
that
my
little
katie
who
was
standing
between
her
father
knees
looked
suddenly
up
and
said
mamma
what
a
noise
old
thomas
this
remark
led
to
a
much
greater
noise
and
the
young
men
unable
to
restrain
their
laughter
ran
tumultuously
from
the
shanty
i
could
have
whipped
the
little
elf
but
small
blame
could
be
attached
to
a
child
of
two
years
old
who
had
never
heard
a
preacher
especially
such
a
preacher
as
the
old
backwoodsman
in
her
life
poor
man
he
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
and
remarked
to
us
after
the
service
was
over
well
did
we
not
get
on
famously
now
wor
that
a
discourse
it
was
indeed
much
better
than
i
yes
yes
i
knew
it
would
please
you
it
had
quite
an
effect
on
those
wild
fellows
a
few
more
such
sermons
will
teach
them
good
behaviour
ah
the
bush
is
a
bad
place
for
young
men
the
farther
in
the
bush
say
i
the
farther
from
god
and
the
nearer
to
hell
i
told
that
wicked
captain
l
of
dummer
so
the
other
sunday
says
he
you
do
hold
your
confounded
jaw
you
old
fool
kick
you
there
now
now
sir
was
not
that
bad
manners
in
a
gentleman
to
use
such
appropriate
epitaphs
to
a
humble
servant
of
god
like
i
and
thus
the
old
man
ran
on
for
an
hour
dilating
upon
his
own
merits
and
the
sins
of
his
neighbors
there
was
john
r
from
the
most
notorious
swearer
in
the
district
a
man
who
esteemed
himself
clever
nor
did
he
want
for
natural
talent
but
he
had
converted
his
mouth
into
such
a
sink
of
iniquity
that
it
corrupted
the
whole
man
and
all
the
weak
and
thoughtless
of
his
own
sex
who
admitted
him
into
their
company
i
had
tried
to
convince
john
r
for
he
often
frequented
the
house
under
the
pretence
of
borrowing
books
of
the
great
crime
that
he
was
constantly
committing
and
of
the
injurious
effect
it
must
produce
upon
his
own
family
but
the
mental
disease
had
taken
too
deep
a
root
to
be
so
easily
cured
like
a
person
labouring
under
some
foul
disease
he
contaminated
all
he
touched
such
men
seem
to
make
an
ambitious
display
of
their
bad
habits
in
such
scenes
and
if
they
afford
a
little
help
they
are
sure
to
get
intoxicated
and
make
a
row
there
was
my
friend
old
ned
dunn
who
had
been
so
anxious
to
get
us
out
of
the
burning
fallow
there
was
a
whole
group
of
dummer
pines
levi
the
little
wiry
witty
poacher
cornish
bill
the
old
peasant
with
his
stalwart
figure
and
uncouth
dialect
and
david
and
nedall
good
men
and
true
and
malachi
chroak
a
queer
that
seemed
like
some
mischievous
elf
flitting
from
heap
to
heap
to
make
work
and
fun
for
the
rest
and
many
others
were
at
that
bee
who
have
since
found
a
rest
in
the
wilderness
adam
t
h
m
n
these
at
different
times
lost
their
lives
in
those
bright
waters
in
which
on
such
occasions
as
these
they
used
to
sport
and
frolic
to
refresh
themselves
during
the
noonday
heat
alas
how
many
who
were
then
young
and
in
their
prime
that
river
and
its
lakes
have
swept
away
our
men
worked
well
until
when
after
washing
in
the
lake
they
all
sat
down
to
the
rude
board
which
i
had
prepared
for
them
loaded
with
the
best
fare
that
could
be
procured
in
the
bush
legs
of
pork
venison
eel
and
raspberry
pies
garnished
with
plenty
of
potatoes
and
whiskey
to
wash
them
down
besides
a
large
iron
kettle
of
tea
to
pour
out
the
latter
and
dispense
it
round
devolved
upon
me
my
brother
and
his
friends
who
were
all
temperance
men
and
consequently
the
best
workers
in
the
field
kept
me
and
the
maid
actively
employed
in
replenishing
their
cups
the
dinner
passed
off
tolerably
well
some
of
the
lower
order
of
the
irish
settlers
were
pretty
far
gone
but
they
committed
no
outrage
upon
our
feelings
by
either
swearing
or
bad
language
a
few
harmless
jokes
alone
circulating
among
them
some
one
was
funning
old
wittalls
for
having
eaten
seven
large
cabbages
at
t
bee
a
few
days
previous
his
son
sol
thought
himself
as
in
duty
bound
to
take
up
the
cudgel
for
his
father
now
i
guess
that
a
lie
anyhow
fayther
was
sick
that
day
and
i
tell
you
he
only
ate
this
announcement
was
followed
by
such
an
explosion
of
mirth
that
the
boy
looked
fiercely
round
him
as
if
he
could
scarcely
believe
the
fact
that
the
whole
party
were
laughing
at
him
malachi
chroak
who
was
drunk
had
discovered
an
old
pair
of
cracked
bellows
in
a
corner
which
he
placed
under
his
arm
and
applying
his
mouth
to
the
pipe
and
working
his
elbows
to
and
fro
pretended
that
he
was
playing
upon
the
bagpipes
every
now
and
then
letting
the
wind
escape
in
a
shrill
squeak
from
this
novel
instrument

frisky
just
and
here
he
minced
to
and
fro
affecting
the
airs
of
a
fine
lady
the
suppositious
bagpipe
gave
an
uncertain
ominous
howl
and
he
flung
it
down
and
started
back
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
alarm
alive

said
malachi
gracefully
waving
his
head
to

to
the
squeaking
of
the
bellows
then
suddenly
tossing
back
the
long
dangling
black
that
curled
down
the
sides
of
his
lank
yellow
cheeks
and
winking
knowingly
with
his
comical
little
black
eyes
he
burst
out
again
wid
the
blarney
i
win
the
most
dainty
proud
dame

soft
sound
of

the
blarney
my
boys
if
you
doubt
it
go
thry
but
hand
here
the
bottle
my
whistle
is
the
men
went
back
to
the
field
leaving
malachi
to
amuse
those
who
remained
in
the
house
and
we
certainly
did
laugh
our
fill
at
his
odd
capers
and
conceits
then
he
would
insist
upon
marrying
our
maid
there
could
be
no
refusal
have
her
he
would
the
girl
to
keep
him
quiet
laughingly
promised
that
she
would
take
him
for
her
husband
this
did
not
satisfy
him
she
must
take
her
oath
upon
the
bible
to
that
effect
mary
pretended
that
there
was
no
bible
in
the
house
but
he
found
an
old
upon
a
shelf
in
the
kitchen
and
upon
it
he
made
her
swear
and
called
upon
me
to
bear
witness
to
her
oath
and
that
she
was
now
his
betrothed
and
he
would
go
next
day
with
her
to
the
poor
mary
had
reason
to
repent
her
frolic
for
he
stuck
close
to
her
the
whole
evening
tormenting
her
to
fulfill
her
contract
after
the
sun
went
down
the
came
in
to
supper
which
was
all
ready
for
them
those
who
remained
sober
ate
the
meal
in
peace
and
quietly
returned
to
their
own
homes
while
the
vicious
and
the
drunken
stayed
to
brawl
and
fight
after
having
placed
the
supper
on
the
table
i
was
so
tired
with
the
noise
and
heat
and
fatigue
of
the
day
that
i
went
to
bed
leaving
to
mary
and
my
husband
the
care
of
the
guests
the
little
was
only
separated
from
the
kitchen
by
a
few
thin
boards
and
unfortunately
for
me
and
the
girl
who
was
soon
forced
to
retreat
thither
we
could
hear
all
the
wickedness
and
profanity
going
on
in
the
next
room
my
husband
disgusted
with
the
scene
soon
left
it
and
retired
into
the
parlour
with
the
few
of
the
loggers
who
at
that
hour
remained
sober
the
house
rang
with
the
sound
of
unhallowed
revelry
profane
songs
and
blasphemous
swearing
it
would
have
been
no
hard
task
to
have
imagined
these
miserable
degraded
beings
fiends
instead
of
men
how
glad
i
was
when
they
at
last
broke
up
and
we
were
once
more
left
in
peace
to
collect
the
broken
glasses
and
cups
and
the
scattered
fragments
of
that
hateful
feast
we
were
obliged
to
endure
a
second
and
a
third
repetition
of
this
odious
scene
before
sixteen
acres
of
land
were
rendered
fit
for
the
reception
of
our
fall
crop
of
wheat
my
hatred
to
these
tumultuous
disorderly
meetings
was
not
in
the
least
decreased
by
my
husband
being
twice
seriously
hurt
while
attending
them
after
the
second
injury
he
received
he
seldom
went
to
them
himself
but
sent
his
oxen
and
servant
in
his
place
in
these
odious
gatherings
the
sober
moral
and
industrious
man
is
more
likely
to
suffer
than
the
drunken
and
profane
as
during
the
delirium
of
drink
these
men
expose
others
to
danger
as
well
as
themselves
the
conduct
of
many
of
the
settlers
who
considered
themselves
gentlemen
and
would
have
been
very
much
affronted
to
have
been
called
otherwise
was
often
more
reprehensible
than
that
of
the
poor
irish
emigrants
to
whom
they
should
have
set
an
example
of
order
and
sobriety
the
behaviour
of
these
young
men
drew
upon
them
the
severe
but
just
censures
of
the
poorer
class
whom
they
regarded
in
every
way
as
their
inferiors
that
blackguard
calls
himself
a
gentleman
in
what
respect
is
he
better
than
us
was
an
observation
too
frequently
made
use
of
at
these
gatherings
to
see
a
bad
man
in
the
very
worst
point
of
view
follow
him
to
a
bee
be
he
profane
licentious
quarrelsome
or
a
rogue
all
his
native
wickedness
will
be
fully
developed
there
just
after
the
last
of
these
we
had
to
part
with
our
good
servant
mary
and
just
at
a
time
when
it
was
the
heaviest
loss
to
me
her
father
who
had
been
a
dairyman
in
the
north
of
ireland
an
honest
industrious
man
had
brought
out
upwards
of
one
hundred
pounds
to
this
country
with
more
wisdom
than
is
generally
exercised
by
irish
emigrants
instead
of
sinking
all
his
means
in
buying
a
bush
farm
he
hired
a
very
good
farm
in
cavan
with
cattle
and
returned
to
his
old
avocation
the
services
of
his
daughter
who
was
an
excellent
dairymaid
were
required
to
take
the
management
of
the
cows
and
her
brother
brought
a
wagon
and
horses
all
the
way
from
the
front
to
take
her
home
this
event
was
perfectly
unexpected
and
left
me
without
a
notice
to
provide
myself
with
another
servant
at
a
time
when
servants
were
not
to
be
had
and
i
was
perfectly
unable
to
do
the
least
thing
my
little
addie
was
sick
almost
to
death
with
the
summer
complaint
and
the
eldest
still
too
young
to
take
care
of
herself
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
trouble
ague
and
lake
fever
had
attacked
our
new
settlement
the
men
in
the
shanty
were
all
down
with
it
and
my
husband
was
confined
to
his
bed
on
each
alternate
day
unable
to
raise
hand
or
foot
and
raving
in
the
delirium
of
the
fever
in
my
sister
and
brother
families
scarcely
a
healthy
person
remained
to
attend
upon
the
sick
and
at
herriot
falls
nine
persons
were
stretched
upon
the
floor
of
one
log
cabin
unable
to
help
themselves
or
one
another
after
much
difficulty
and
only
by
offering
enormous
wages
i
succeeded
in
procuring
a
nurse
to
attend
upon
me
during
my
confinement
the
woman
had
not
been
a
day
in
the
house
before
she
was
attacked
by
the
same
fever
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
and
with
my
precious
little
addie
lying
insensible
on
a
pillow
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
expected
at
every
moment
to
breathe
her
last
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
the
boy
i
had
so
ardently
coveted
was
born
the
next
day
old
pine
carried
his
wife
my
nurse
away
upon
his
back
and
i
was
left
to
struggle
through
in
the
best
manner
i
could
with
a
sick
husband
a
sick
child
and
a
newborn
babe
it
was
a
melancholy
season
one
of
severe
mental
and
bodily
suffering
those
who
have
drawn
such
agreeable
pictures
of
a
residence
in
the
backwoods
never
dwell
upon
the
periods
of
sickness
when
far
from
medical
advice
and
often
as
in
my
case
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
friends
by
adverse
circumstances
you
are
left
to
languish
unattended
upon
the
couch
of
pain
the
day
that
my
husband
was
free
of
the
fit
he
did
what
he
could
for
me
and
his
poor
sick
babes
but
ill
as
he
was
he
was
obliged
to
sow
the
wheat
to
enable
the
man
to
proceed
with
the
drag
and
was
therefore
necessarily
absent
in
the
field
the
greater
part
of
the
day
i
was
very
ill
yet
for
hours
at
a
time
i
had
no
friendly
voice
to
cheer
me
to
proffer
me
a
drink
of
cold
water
or
to
attend
to
the
poor
babe
and
worse
still
worse
there
was
no
one
to
help
that
pale
marble
child
who
lay
so
cold
and
still
with
violet
eyes
as
if
death
had
already
chilled
her
young
heart
in
his
iron
grasp
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
in
our
close
burning
and
the
weather
was
sultry
beyond
all
that
i
have
since
experienced
how
i
wished
that
i
could
be
transported
to
a
hospital
at
home
to
enjoy
the
common
care
that
in
such
places
is
bestowed
upon
the
sick
bitter
tears
flowed
continually
from
my
eyes
over
those
young
children
i
had
asked
of
heaven
a
son
and
there
he
lay
helpless
by
the
side
of
his
almost
equally
helpless
mother
who
could
not
lift
him
up
in
her
arms
or
still
his
cries
while
the
pale
fair
angel
with
her
golden
curls
who
had
lately
been
the
admiration
of
all
who
saw
her
no
longer
recognized
my
voice
or
was
conscious
of
my
presence
i
felt
that
i
could
almost
resign
the
long
and
eagerly
son
to
win
one
more
smile
from
that
sweet
suffering
creature
often
did
i
weep
myself
to
sleep
and
wake
to
weep
again
with
renewed
anguish
and
my
poor
little
katie
herself
under
three
years
of
age
how
patiently
she
bore
the
loss
of
my
care
and
every
comfort
how
earnestly
the
dear
thing
strove
to
help
me
she
would
sit
on
my
and
hold
my
hand
and
ask
me
to
look
at
her
and
speak
to
her
would
inquire
why
addie
slept
so
long
and
when
she
would
awake
again
those
innocent
questions
went
like
arrows
to
my
heart
lieutenant
the
husband
of
my
dear
emilia
at
length
heard
of
my
situation
his
inestimable
wife
was
from
home
nursing
her
sick
mother
but
he
sent
his
up
every
day
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
the
kind
girl
despatched
a
messenger
nine
miles
through
the
woods
to
dummer
to
fetch
her
younger
sister
a
child
of
twelve
years
old
oh
how
grateful
i
felt
for
these
signal
mercies
for
my
situation
for
nearly
a
week
was
one
of
the
most
pitiable
that
could
be
imagined
the
sickness
was
so
prevalent
that
help
was
not
to
be
obtained
for
money
and
without
the
assistance
of
that
little
girl
young
as
she
was
it
is
more
than
probable
that
neither
myself
nor
my
children
would
ever
have
risen
from
that
bed
of
sickness
the
conduct
of
our
man
jacob
during
this
trying
period
was
marked
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
consideration
on
the
days
that
his
master
was
confined
to
his
bed
with
the
fever
he
used
to
place
a
vessel
of
cold
water
and
a
cup
by
his
bedside
and
put
his
honest
english
face
in
at
my
door
to
know
if
he
could
make
a
cup
of
tea
or
toast
a
bit
of
bread
for
the
mistress
before
he
went
into
the
field
katie
was
indebted
to
him
for
all
meals
he
baked
and
cooked
and
churned
milked
the
cows
and
made
up
the
butter
as
well
and
as
carefully
as
the
best
female
servant
could
have
done
as
to
poor
john
monanghan
he
was
down
with
fever
in
the
shanty
where
four
other
men
were
all
ill
with
the
same
terrible
complaint
i
was
obliged
to
leave
my
bed
and
endeavour
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
my
young
family
long
before
i
was
really
able
when
i
made
my
first
attempt
to
reach
the
parlour
i
was
so
weak
that
at
every
step
i
felt
as
if
i
should
pitch
forward
to
the
ground
which
seemed
to
undulate
beneath
my
feet
like
the
floor
of
a
cabin
in
a
storm
at
sea
my
husband
continued
to
suffer
for
many
weeks
with
the
ague
and
when
he
was
convalescent
all
the
children
even
the
poor
babe
were
seized
with
it
nor
did
it
leave
us
until
late
in
the
spring
of
the
emigrant
farewell
rise
mary
meet
me
on
the
shore
and
tell
our
tale
of
sorrow
there
must
we
meet
to
part
no
more
rise
mary
rise
come
dearest
come
tho
all
in
vain
once
more
beside
yon
summer
main
we
plight
our
hopeless
vows
again
unclose
thine
eyes
my
bark
amidst
the
surge
is
toss
i
go
by
evil
fortunes
cross
my
earthly
hopes
for
ever
lost
love
dearest
prize
but
when
thy
hand
is
clasp
in
mine
i
laugh
at
fortune
nor
repine
in

in

for
ever
thine
then
check
these
sighs
they
move
a
bosom
steel
to
bear
its
own
unwonted
load
of
care
that
will
not
bend
beneath
despair

chapter

a
trip
to
stony
lake
oh
nature
in
thy
face
by
rocky
shore
or
the
forest
tree
what
love
divine
what
matchless
skill
i
trace
my
full
warm
heart
responsive
thrills
to
thee
yea
in
my
throbbing
bosom
inmost
core
thou
supreme
and
in
thy
sternest
mood
thy
votary
bends
in
rapture
to
adore
the
mighty
maker
who
pronounced
thee
good
thy
broad
majestic
brow
still
bears
his
seal
and
when
i
cease
to
love
oh
may
i
cease
to
feel
my
husband
had
long
promised
me
a
trip
to
stony
lake
and
in
the
summer
of
before
the
harvest
commenced
he
gave
y
who
kept
the
mill
at
the
rapids
below
clear
lake
notice
of
our
intention
and
the
worthy
old
man
and
his
family
made
due
preparation
for
our
reception
the
little
girls
were
to
accompany
us
we
were
to
start
at
sunrise
to
avoid
the
heat
of
the
day
to
go
up
as
far
as
y
in
our
canoe
with
his
sons
above
the
rapids
in
canoes
go
as
far
up
the
lake
as
we
could
accomplish
by
daylight
and
return
at
night
the
weather
being
very
warm
and
the
moon
at
full
before
six
we
were
all
seated
in
the
little
craft
which
spread
her
white
sail
to
a
foaming
breeze
and
sped
merrily
over
the
blue
waters
the
lake
on
which
our
clearing
stood
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
and
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
in
breadth
a
mere
pond
when
compared
with
the
bay
of
quinte
ontario
and
the
inland
seas
of
canada
but
it
was
lake
and
consequently
it
had
ten
thousand
beauties
in
our
eyes
which
would
scarcely
have
attracted
the
observation
of
a
stranger
at
the
head
of
the
katchawanook
the
lake
is
divided
by
a
long
neck
of
land
that
forms
a
small
bay
on
the
side
and
a
very
brisk
rapid
on
the
left
the
banks
are
formed
of
large
masses
of
limestone
and
the
and
the
seem
to
have
taken
an
especial
fancy
to
this
spot
and
to
vie
with
each
other
in
the
display
of
their
gorgeous
colours
it
is
an
excellent
place
for
fishing
the
water
is
very
deep
close
to
the
rocky
pavement
that
forms
the
bank
and
it
has
a
pebbly
bottom
many
a
magic
hour
at
rosy
dawn
or
evening
grey
have
i
spent
with
my
husband
on
this
romantic
spot
our
canoe
fastened
to
a
bush
and
ourselves
intent
upon
ensnaring
the
black
bass
a
fish
of
excellent
flavour
that
abounds
in
this
place
our
paddles
soon
carried
us
past
the
narrows
and
through
the
rapid
water
the
children
sitting
quietly
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
enchanted
with
all
they
heard
and
saw
begging
papa
to
stop
and
gather
or
to
catch
one
of
the
splendid
butterflies
that
hovered
over
us
and
often
the
little
addie
darted
her
white
hand
into
the
water
to
grasp
at
the
shadow
of
the
gorgeous
insects
as
they
skimmed
along
the
waves
after
passing
the
rapids
the
river
widened
into
another
small
lake
perfectly
round
in
form
and
having
in
its
centre
a
tiny
green
island
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
like
a
shattered
monument
of
bygone
storms
one
blasted
black
the
indians
call
this
lake
bessikakoon
but
i
do
not
know
the
exact
meaning
of
the
word
some
say
that
it
means
the
indian
grave
others
the
lake
of
the
one
it
is
certain
that
an
indian
girl
is
buried
beneath
that
blighted
tree
but
i
never
could
learn
the
particulars
of
her
story
and
perhaps
there
was
no
tale
connected
with
it
she
might
have
fallen
a
victim
to
disease
during
the
wanderings
of
her
tribe
and
been
buried
on
that
spot
or
she
might
have
been
drowned
which
would
account
for
her
having
been
buried
away
from
the
rest
of
her
people
this
little
lake
lies
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
there
is
but
one
clearing
upon
its
shores
and
that
had
been
made
by
lumberers
many
years
before
the
place
abounded
with
red
cedar
a
second
growth
of
young
timber
had
grown
up
in
this
spot
which
was
covered
also
with
several
hundred
acres
being
entirely
overgrown
with
this
delicious
berry
it
was
here
annually
that
we
used
to
come
in
large
picnic
parties
to
collect
this
valuable
fruit
for
our
winter
preserves
in
defiance
of
mosquitoes
snakes
and
even
bears
all
which
have
been
encountered
by
upon
this
spot
as
busy
and
as
active
as
themselves
gathering
an
ample
repast
from
bounteous
lap
and
oh
what
beautiful
wild
shrubs
and
flowers
grew
up
in
that
neglected
spot
some
of
the
happiest
hours
i
spent
in
the
bush
are
connected
with
reminiscences
of
irving
shanty
for
so
the
were
called
the
clearing
could
not
be
seen
from
the
shore
you
had
to
scramble
through
a
to
reach
the
sloping
ground
which
produced
the
berries
the
mill
at
the
clear
lake
rapids
was
about
three
miles
distant
from
our
own
clearing
and
after
stemming
another
rapid
and
passing
between
two
beautiful
wooded
islands
the
canoe
rounded
a
point
and
the
rude
structure
was
before
us
a
wilder
and
more
romantic
spot
than
that
which
the
old
hunter
had
chosen
for
his
homestead
in
the
wilderness
could
scarcely
be
imagined
the
waters
of
clear
lake
here
empty
themselves
through
a
narrow
deep
rocky
channel
not
exceeding
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
and
tumble
over
a
limestone
ridge
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
height
which
extends
from
one
bank
of
the
river
to
the
other
the
shores
on
either
side
are
very
steep
and
the
large
which
have
anchored
their
roots
in
every
crevice
of
the
rock
throw
their
fantastic
arms
far
over
the
foaming
waterfall
the
deep
green
of
their
massy
foliage
forming
a
beautiful
contrast
with
the
white
flashing
waters
that
foam
over
the
shoot
at
least
fifty
feet
below
the
brow
of
the
limestone
rock
by
a
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
banks
we
ascended
to
the
platform
above
the
river
on
which
y
house
stood
it
was
a
large
log
building
surrounded
by
barns
and
sheds
of
the
same
primitive
material
the
porch
before
the
door
was
covered
with
hops
and
the
room
of
general
resort
into
which
it
immediately
opened
was
of
large
dimensions
the
huge
forming
the
most
striking
feature
on
the
hot
as
was
the
weather
blazed
a
great
fire
encumbered
with
all
sorts
of
culinary
apparatus
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
had
been
called
into
requisition
for
our
sole
benefit
and
accommodation
the
good
folks
had
breakfasted
long
before
we
started
from
home
but
they
would
not
hear
of
our
proceeding
to
stony
lake
until
after
we
had
dined
it
was
only
eight
and
we
had
still
four
hours
to
dinner
which
gave
us
ample
leisure
to
listen
to
the
old
man
stories
ramble
round
the
premises
and
observe
all
the
striking
features
of
the
place
y
was
a
catholic
and
the
son
of
a
respectable
farmer
from
the
south
of
ireland
some
few
years
before
he
had
emigrated
with
a
large
family
of
seven
sons
and
two
daughters
and
being
fond
of
field
sports
and
greatly
taken
with
the
beauty
of
the
locality
in
which
he
had
pitched
his
tent
in
the
wilderness
he
determined
to
raise
a
mill
upon
the
dam
which
nature
had
provided
to
his
hands
and
wait
patiently
until
the
increasing
immigration
should
settle
the
townships
of
smith
and
douro
render
the
property
valuable
and
bring
plenty
of
grist
to
the
mill
he
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
calculations
and
though
for
the
first
few
years
he
subsisted
entirely
by
hunting
fishing
and
raising
what
potatoes
and
wheat
he
required
for
his
own
family
on
the
most
fertile
spots
he
could
find
on
his
barren
lot
very
little
corn
passed
through
the
mill
at
the
time
we
visited
his
place
he
was
driving
a
thriving
trade
and
all
the
wheat
that
was
grown
in
the
neighbourhood
was
brought
by
water
to
be
ground
at
y
mill
he
had
lost
his
wife
a
few
years
after
coming
to
the
country
but
his
two
daughters
betty
and
norah
were
excellent
housewives
and
amply
supplied
her
loss
from
these
amiable
women
we
received
a
most
kind
and
hearty
welcome
and
every
comfort
and
luxury
within
their
reach
they
appeared
a
most
happy
and
contented
family
the
sons
a
fine
hardy
independent
set
of
fellows
were
regarded
by
the
old
man
with
pride
and
affection
many
were
his
anecdotes
of
their
prowess
in
hunting
and
fishing
his
method
of
giving
them
an
aversion
to
strong
drink
while
very
young
amused
me
greatly
but
it
is
not
every
child
that
could
have
stood
the
test
of
his
experiment
when
they
were
little
chaps
from
five
to
six
years
of
age
i
made
them
very
drunk
he
said
so
drunk
that
it
brought
on
severe
headache
and
sickness
and
this
so
disgusted
them
with
liquor
that
they
never
could
abide
the
sight
of
it
again
i
have
only
one
drunkard
among
the
seven
and
he
was
such
a
weak
puling
crathur
that
i
dared
not
try
the
same
game
with
him
lest
it
should
kill
him
is
his
nature
i
suppose
and
he
ca
help
it
but
the
truth
is
that
to
make
up
for
the
sobriety
of
all
the
rest
he
is
killing
himself
with
norah
gave
us
an
account
of
her
catching
a
deer
that
had
got
into
the
enclosure
the
day
before
i
went
out
she
said
early
in
the
morning
to
milk
the
cows
and
i
saw
a
fine
young
buck
struggling
to
get
through
a
pale
of
the
fence
in
which
having
entangled
his
head
and
horns
i
knew
by
the
desperate
efforts
he
was
making
to
push
aside
the
rails
that
if
i
was
not
quick
in
getting
hold
of
him
he
would
soon
be
and
did
you
dare
to
touch
him
if
i
had
had
mat
gun
i
would
have
shot
him
but
he
would
have
made
his
escape
long
before
i
could
run
to
the
house
for
that
so
i
went
boldly
up
to
him
and
got
him
by
the
hind
legs
and
though
he
kicked
and
struggled
dreadfully
i
held
on
till
mat
heard
me
call
and
ran
to
my
help
and
cut
his
throat
with
his
so
you
see
she
continued
with
a
laugh
i
can
beat
our
hunters
hollow
they
hunt
the
deer
but
i
can
catch
a
buck
with
my
while
we
were
chatting
away
great
were
the
preparations
making
by
miss
betty
and
a
very
handsome
american
woman
who
had
recently
come
thither
as
a
help
one
little
barefooted
garsoon
was
shelling
peas
in
an
indian
basket
another
was
stringing
currants
into
a
yellow
and
a
third
was
sent
to
the
rapids
with
his
rod
and
line
to
procure
a
dish
of
fresh
fish
to
add
to
the
long
list
of
bush
dainties
that
were
preparing
for
our
dinner
it
was
in
vain
that
i
begged
our
kind
entertainers
not
to
put
themselves
to
the
least
trouble
on
our
account
telling
them
that
we
were
now
used
to
the
woods
and
contented
with
anything
they
were
determined
to
exhaust
all
their
stores
to
furnish
forth
the
entertainment
nor
can
it
be
wondered
at
that
with
so
many
dishes
to
cook
and
pies
and
custards
to
bake
instead
of
dining
at
twelve
it
was
past
two
before
we
were
conducted
to
the
i
was
vexed
and
disappointed
at
the
delay
as
i
wanted
to
see
all
i
could
of
the
spot
we
were
about
to
visit
before
night
and
darkness
compelled
us
to
return
the
feast
was
spread
in
a
large
outhouse
the
table
being
formed
of
two
broad
deal
boards
laid
together
and
supported
by
rude
carpenter
stools
a
white
linen
cloth
a
relic
of
better
days
concealed
these
arrangements
the
board
was
covered
with
an
indescribable
variety
of
roast
and
boiled
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
my
readers
should
see
a
table
laid
out
in
a
wealthy
canadian
farmer
house
before
they
can
have
any
idea
of
the
profusion
displayed
in
the
entertainment
of
two
visitors
and
their
young
children
besides
venison
pork
chickens
ducks
and
fish
of
several
kinds
cooked
in
a
variety
of
ways
there
was
a
number
of
pumpkin
raspberry
cherry
and
currant
pies
with
fresh
butter
and
green
cheese
as
the
new
is
called
molasses
preserves
and
pickled
cucumbers
besides
tea
and
coffee
the
latter
be
it
known
i
had
watched
the
american
woman
boiling
in
the
it
was
a
compound
and
i
did
not
attempt
to
discuss
its
merits
the
vessel
in
which
it
had
been
prepared
had
prejudiced
me
and
rendered
me
very
sceptical
on
that
score
we
were
all
very
hungry
having
tasted
nothing
since
five
in
the
morning
and
contrived
out
of
the
variety
of
good
things
before
us
to
make
an
excellent
dinner
i
was
glad
however
when
we
rose
to
prosecute
our
intended
trip
up
the
lake
the
old
man
whose
heart
was
now
thoroughly
warmed
with
whiskey
declared
that
he
meant
to
make
one
of
the
party
and
betty
too
was
to
accompany
us
her
sister
norah
kindly
staying
behind
to
take
care
of
the
children
we
followed
a
path
along
the
top
of
the
high
ridge
of
limestone
rock
until
we
had
passed
the
falls
and
the
rapids
above
when
we
found
pat
and
mat
y
waiting
for
us
on
the
shore
below
in
two
beautiful
new
canoes
which
they
had
purchased
the
day
before
from
the
indians
miss
betty
mat
and
myself
were
safely
stowed
into
one
while
the
old
miller
and
his
son
pat
and
my
husband
embarked
in
the
other
and
our
steersmen
pushed
off
into
the
middle
of
the
deep
and
silent
stream
the
shadow
of
the
tall
woods
towering
so
many
feet
above
us
casting
an
inky
hue
upon
the
waters
the
scene
was
very
imposing
and
after
paddling
for
a
few
minutes
in
shade
and
silence
we
suddenly
emerged
into
light
and
sunshine
and
clear
lake
which
gets
its
name
from
the
unrivalled
brightness
of
its
waters
spread
out
its
azure
mirror
before
us
the
indians
regard
this
sheet
of
water
with
peculiar
reverence
it
abounds
in
the
finest
sorts
of
fish
the
the
delicious
white
fish
maskinonge
and
black
and
white
bass
there
is
no
island
in
this
lake
no
rice
beds
nor
stick
nor
stone
to
break
its
tranquil
beauty
and
at
the
time
we
visited
it
there
was
but
one
clearing
upon
its
shores
the
log
hut
of
the
squatter
p
commanding
a
beautiful
prospect
up
and
down
the
lake
stood
upon
a
bold
slope
fronting
the
water
all
the
rest
was
unbroken
forest
we
had
proceeded
about
a
mile
on
our
pleasant
voyage
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
singular
natural
phenomenon
which
mat
y
called
the
battery
on
the
side
of
the
shore
rose
a
steep
perpendicular
wall
of
limestone
that
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
laid
by
the
hand
of
man
so
smooth
and
even
was
its
surface
after
attaining
a
height
of
about
fifty
feet
a
natural
platform
of
eight
or
ten
yards
broke
the
perpendicular
line
of
the
rock
when
another
wall
like
the
first
rose
to
a
considerable
height
terminating
in
a
second
and
third
platform
of
the
same
description
fire
at
some
distant
period
had
run
over
these
singularly
beautiful
terraces
and
a
second
growth
of
poplars
and
relieved
by
their
tender
green
and
light
airy
foilage
the
sombre
indigo
tint
of
the
heavy
pines
that
nodded
like
the
plumes
of
a
over
the
fair
young
dwellers
on
the
rock
the
water
is
forty
feet
deep
at
the
base
of
this
precipice
which
is
washed
by
the
waves
after
we
had
passed
the
battery
mat
y
turned
to
me
and
said
that
is
a
famous
place
for
bears
many
a
bear
have
i
shot
among
those
this
led
to
a
long
discussion
on
the
wild
beasts
of
the
country
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
much
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
them
said
he
but
i
once
had
an
ugly
adventure
with
a
wolf
two
winters
ago
on
this
i
was
all
curiosity
to
hear
the
story
which
sounded
doubly
interesting
told
on
the
very
spot
and
while
gliding
over
those
lovely
waters
we
were
lumbering
at
the
head
of
stony
lake
about
eight
miles
from
here
my
four
brothers
myself
and
several
other
hands
the
winter
was
long
and
severe
although
it
was
the
first
week
in
march
there
was
not
the
least
appearance
of
a
thaw
and
the
ice
on
these
lakes
was
as
firm
as
ever
i
had
been
sent
home
to
fetch
a
yoke
of
oxen
to
draw
the
down
to
the
water
our
chopping
being
all
completed
and
the
logs
ready
for
rafting
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
encumber
myself
with
my
rifle
and
was
therefore
provided
with
no
weapon
of
defence
but
the
long
gad
i
used
to
urge
on
the
cattle
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
i
rounded
sandy
point
that
long
point
which
is
about
a
mile
of
us
on
the
left
shore
when
i
first
discovered
that
i
was
followed
but
at
a
great
distance
by
a
large
wolf
at
first
i
thought
little
of
the
circumstance
beyond
a
passing
wish
that
i
had
brought
my
gun
i
knew
that
he
would
not
attack
me
before
dark
and
it
was
still
two
long
hours
to
sundown
so
i
whistled
and
urged
on
my
oxen
and
soon
forgot
the
wolf
when
on
stopping
to
repair
a
little
damage
to
the
peg
of
the
yoke
i
was
surprised
to
find
him
close
at
my
heels
i
turned
and
ran
towards
him
shouting
as
loud
as
i
could
when
he
slunk
back
but
showed
no
inclination
to
make
off
knowing
that
he
must
have
companions
near
by
his
boldness
i
shouted
as
loud
as
i
could
hoping
that
my
cries
might
be
heard
by
my
brothers
who
would
imagine
that
the
oxen
had
got
into
the
ice
and
would
come
to
my
assistance
i
was
now
winding
my
way
through
the
islands
in
stony
lake
the
sun
was
setting
red
before
me
and
i
had
still
three
miles
of
my
journey
to
accomplish
the
wolf
had
become
so
impudent
that
i
kept
him
off
by
pelting
him
with
snowballs
and
once
he
came
so
near
that
i
struck
him
with
the
gad
i
now
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
and
from
time
to
time
shouted
with
all
my
strength
and
you
may
imagine
my
joy
when
these
cries
were
answered
by
the
report
of
a
gun
my
brothers
had
heard
me
and
the
discharge
of
a
gun
for
a
moment
seemed
to
daunt
the
wolf
he
uttered
a
long
howl
which
was
answered
by
the
cries
of
a
large
pack
of
the
dirty
brutes
from
the
wood
it
was
only
just
light
enough
to
distinguish
objects
and
i
had
to
stop
and
face
my
enemy
to
keep
him
at
bay
i
saw
the
skeleton
forms
of
more
of
them
slinking
among
the
bushes
that
skirted
a
low
island
and
tired
and
cold
i
gave
myself
and
the
oxen
up
for
lost
when
i
felt
the
ice
tremble
on
which
i
stood
and
heard
men
running
at
a
little
distance
your
guns
i
cried
out
as
loud
as
i
could
my
order
was
obeyed
and
such
a
yelling
and
howling
immediately
filled
the
whole
forest
as
would
have
chilled
your
very
heart
the
thievish
varmints
instantly
fled
away
into
the
bush
i
never
felt
the
least
fear
of
wolves
until
that
night
but
when
they
meet
in
large
bands
like
cowardly
dogs
they
trust
to
their
numbers
and
grow
fierce
if
you
meet
with
one
wolf
you
may
be
certain
that
the
whole
pack
are
at
no
great
we
were
fast
approaching
sandy
point
a
long
white
ridge
of
sand
running
half
across
the
lake
and
though
only
covered
with
scattered
groups
of
scrubby
trees
and
brush
it
effectually
screened
stony
lake
from
our
view
there
were
so
many
beautiful
flowers
peeping
through
the
dwarf
green
bushes
that
wishing
to
inspect
them
nearer
mat
kindly
ran
the
canoe
ashore
and
told
me
that
he
would
show
me
a
pretty
spot
where
an
indian
who
had
been
drowned
during
a
storm
off
that
point
was
buried
i
immediately
recalled
the
story
of
susan
moore
father
but
mat
thought
that
he
was
interred
upon
one
of
the
islands
farther
up
it
is
strange
he
said
that
they
are
such
bad
swimmers
the
indian
though
unrivalled
by
us
whites
in
the
use
of
the
paddle
is
an
animal
that
does
not
take
readily
to
the
water
and
those
among
them
who
can
swim
seldom
use
it
as
a
pushing
our
way
through
the
bushes
we
came
to
a
small
opening
in
the
underwood
so
thickly
grown
over
with
wild
canadian
roses
in
full
blossom
that
the
air
was
impregnated
with
a
delightful
odour
in
the
centre
of
this
bed
of
sweets
rose
the
humble
mound
that
protected
the
bones
of
the
red
man
from
the
ravenous
jaws
of
the
wolf
and
the
wild
cat
it
was
completely
covered
with
stones
and
from
among
the
crevices
had
sprung
a
tuft
of
blue
harebells
waving
as
wild
and
free
as
if
they
grew
among
the
bonny
red
heather
on
the
glorious
hills
of
the
north
or
shook
their
tiny
bells
to
the
breeze
on
the
commons
of
england
the
harebell
had
always
from
a
child
been
with
me
a
favourite
flower
and
the
first
sight
of
it
in
canada
growing
upon
that
lonely
grave
so
flooded
my
soul
with
remembrances
of
the
past
that
in
spite
of
myself
the
tears
poured
freely
from
my
eyes
there
are
moments
when
it
is
impossible
to
repress
those
outgushings
of
the
heart
those
of
the
soul
that
sever
in
passion
tide
to
part
for
if
mat
and
his
sister
wondered
at
my
tears
they
must
have
suspected
the
cause
for
they
walked
to
a
little
distance
and
left
me
to
the
indulgence
of
my
feelings
i
gathered
those
flowers
and
placed
them
in
my
bosom
and
kept
them
for
many
a
day
they
had
become
holy
when
connected
with
sacred
home
recollections
and
the
affections
of
the
heart
which
the
sight
of
them
recalled
a
shout
from
our
companions
in
the
other
canoe
made
us
retrace
our
steps
to
the
shore
they
had
already
rounded
the
point
and
were
wondering
at
our
absence
oh
what
a
magnificent
scene
of
wild
and
lonely
grandeur
burst
upon
us
as
we
swept
round
the
little
peninsula
and
the
whole
majesty
of
stony
lake
broke
upon
us
at
once
another
lake
of
the
thousand
isles
in
miniature
and
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
imagine
a
large
sheet
of
water
some
fifteen
miles
in
breadth
and
in
length
taken
up
by
islands
of
every
size
and
shape
from
the
lofty
naked
rock
of
red
granite
to
the
rounded
hill
covered
with
to
its
summit
while
others
were
level
with
the
waters
and
of
a
rich
emerald
green
only
fringed
with
a
growth
of
aquatic
shrubs
and
flowers
never
did
my
eyes
rest
on
a
more
lovely
or
beautiful
scene
not
a
vestige
of
man
or
of
his
works
was
there
the
setting
sun
that
cast
such
a
gorgeous
flood
of
light
upon
this
exquisite
panorama
bringing
out
some
of
these
lofty
islands
in
strong
relief
and
casting
others
into
intense
shade
shed
no
cheery
beam
upon
church
spire
or
cottage
pane
we
beheld
the
landscape
savage
and
grand
in
its
primeval
beauty
as
we
floated
among
the
channels
between
these
rocky
picturesque
isles
i
asked
mat
how
many
of
them
there
were
i
never
could
succeed
he
said
in
counting
them
all
one
sunday
pat
and
i
spent
a
whole
day
in
going
from
one
to
the
other
to
try
and
make
out
how
many
there
were
but
we
could
only
count
up
to
one
hundred
and
forty
before
we
gave
up
the
task
in
despair
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
more
than
any
one
would
think
and
what
is
very
singular
the
channel
between
them
is
very
deep
sometimes
above
forty
feet
which
accounts
for
the
few
rapids
to
be
found
in
this
lake
it
is
a
glorious
place
for
hunting
and
the
waters
undisturbed
by
abound
in
all
sorts
of
fish
most
of
these
islands
are
covered
with
huckleberries
while
grapes
high
and
cranberries
blackberries
wild
cherries
gooseberries
and
several
sorts
of
wild
currants
grow
here
in
profusion
there
is
one
island
among
these
groups
but
i
never
could
light
upon
the
identical
one
where
the
indians
yearly
gather
their
they
come
here
to
collect
the
best
for
their
canoes
and
to
gather
wild
onions
in
short
from
the
game
fish
and
fruit
which
they
collect
among
the
islands
of
this
lake
they
chiefly
depend
for
their
subsistence
they
are
very
jealous
of
the
settlers
in
the
country
coming
to
hunt
and
fish
here
and
tell
many
stories
of
wild
beasts
and
rattlesnakes
that
abound
along
its
shores
but
i
who
have
frequented
the
lake
for
years
was
never
disturbed
by
anything
beyond
the
adventure
with
the
wolf
which
i
have
already
told
you
the
banks
of
this
lake
are
all
steep
and
rocky
and
the
land
along
the
shore
is
barren
and
totally
unfit
for
cultivation
had
we
time
to
run
up
a
few
miles
further
i
could
have
showed
you
some
places
well
worth
a
journey
to
look
at
but
the
sun
is
already
down
and
it
will
be
dark
before
we
get
back
to
the
the
other
canoe
now
floated
alongside
and
pat
agreed
with
his
brother
that
it
was
high
time
to
return
with
reluctance
i
turned
from
this
strangely
fascinating
scene
as
we
passed
under
one
bold
rocky
island
mat
said
laughingly
that
is
mount
how
did
it
obtain
that
name
oh
we
were
out
here
berrying
with
our
good
priest
b
this
island
promised
so
fair
that
we
landed
upon
it
and
after
searching
for
an
hour
we
returned
to
the
boat
without
a
single
berry
upon
which
b
named
it
rascal
the
island
was
so
beautiful
it
did
not
deserve
the
name
and
i
christened
it
oak
hill
from
the
abundance
of
which
clothed
its
steep
sides
the
wood
of
this
oak
is
so
heavy
and
hard
that
it
will
not
float
in
the
water
and
it
is
in
great
request
for
the
runners
of
which
have
to
pass
over
very
bad
roads
the
breeze
which
had
rendered
our
sail
up
the
lakes
so
expeditious
and
refreshing
had
stiffened
into
a
pretty
high
wind
which
was
dead
against
us
all
the
way
down
betty
now
knelt
in
the
bow
and
assisted
her
brother
squaw
fashion
in
paddling
the
canoe
but
in
spite
of
all
their
united
exertions
it
was
past
ten
before
we
reached
the
mill
the
good
norah
was
waiting
tea
for
us
she
had
given
the
children
their
supper
four
hours
ago
and
the
little
creatures
tired
with
using
their
feet
all
day
were
sound
asleep
upon
her
bed
after
supper
several
irish
songs
were
sung
while
pat
played
upon
the
fiddle
and
betty
and
mat
enlivened
the
company
with
an
irish
jig
it
was
midnight
when
the
children
were
placed
on
my
cloak
at
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
and
we
bade
adieu
to
this
hospitable
family
the
wind
being
dead
against
us
we
were
obliged
to
dispense
with
the
sail
and
take
to
our
paddles
the
moonlight
was
as
bright
as
day
the
air
warm
and
balmy
and
the
aromatic
resinous
smell
exuded
by
the
heat
from
the
and
the
in
the
forest
added
greatly
to
our
sense
of
enjoyment
as
we
floated
past
scenes
so
wild
and
lonely
isles
that
assumed
a
mysterious
look
and
character
in
that
witching
hour
in
moments
like
these
i
ceased
to
regret
my
separation
from
my
native
land
and
filled
with
the
love
of
nature
my
heart
forgot
for
the
time
the
love
of
home
the
very
spirit
of
peace
seemed
to
brood
over
the
waters
which
were
broken
into
a
thousand
ripples
of

through

softened
by

the
long
mournful
cry
of
the
alone

the

night
amid
these
lonely
wilds
the
soul
draws
nearer
to
god
and
is
filled
to
overflowing
by
the
overwhelming
sense
of
his
presence
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
we
fastened
the
canoe
to
the
landing
and
moodie
carried
up
the
children
to
the
house
i
found
the
girl
still
up
with
my
boy
who
had
been
very
restless
during
our
absence
my
heart
reproached
me
as
i
caught
him
to
my
breast
for
leaving
him
so
long
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
consoled
for
past
sorrows
and
sleeping
sweetly
in
my
arms

the

is
fresh
and

the

are
blue
and
is
joy
to
float
along
away
the
waters
the
waters
the
waters
as
they
dance
in
light
and
song
when
the
great
creator
spoke
on
the
long
unmeasured
night
the
living

and
the

own
his

the
voice
of

chapter
xix
the
ould
dhragoon
i
am
indebted
to
my
husband
for
this
sketch
behold
that
man
with
lanky
locks
which
hang
in
strange
confusion
his
brow
and
nicely
scan
his
garments
rent
and
patch
in
colours
varied
like
a
pictured
map
and
watch
his
restless
glance
now
grave
now
gay
as
saddening
thought
or
merry
humour
flash
sweeps
the
lines
which
care
hath
left
as
when
the
world
is
steep
in
blackest
night
the
forked
lightning
flashes
through
the
sky
and
all
around
leaps
into
life
and
light
to
sink
again
in
darkness
blacker
still
yes
look
upon
that
face
lugubrious
long
as
thoughtfully
he
stands
with
folded
arms
amid
his
realm
of
charr
and
spectral
stumps
which
once
were
trees
but
now
with
sprawling
roots
cling
to
the
rocks
which
peep
above
the
soil
ay
look
again
and
say
if
you
discern
the
faintest
trace
of
warrior
bold
the
gait
erect
and
proud
the
steady
glance
that
speaks
the
fearless
soul
watchful
and
prompt
to
do
what
man
can
do
when
duty
calls
all
wreck
and
reckless
now
but
let
the
trumpet
sound
wake
up
the
brattling
echoes
of
the
woods
then
watch
his
kindling
eye
his
eagle
glance
while
thoughts
of
glorious
fields
and
battles
won
and
visions
bright
of
joyous
hopeful
youth
sweep
his
soul
a
soldier
now
once
more
touch
by
the
magic
sound
he
rears
his
head
responsive
to
the
martial
note
and
stands
again
a
hero
his
rags
it
is
delightful
to
observe
a
feeling
of
contentment
under
adverse
circumstances
we
may
smile
at
the
rude
and
clumsy
attempts
of
the
remote
and
isolated
backwoodsman
to
attain
something
like
comfort
but
happy
he
who
with
the
buoyant
spirits
of
the
irishman
contrives
to
make
himself
happy
even
when
all
others
would
be
miserable
a
certain
degree
of
dissatisfaction
with
our
present
circumstances
is
necessary
to
stimulate
us
to
exertion
and
thus
to
enable
us
to
secure
future
comfort
but
where
the
delusive
prospect
of
future
happiness
is
too
remote
for
any
reasonable
hope
of
ultimate
attainment
then
surely
it
is
true
wisdom
to
make
the
most
of
the
present
and
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
happy
contentment
with
the
lot
assigned
to
us
by
providence
ould
simpson
or
the
ould
dhragoon
as
he
was
generally
called
was
a
good
sample
of
this
happy
character
and
i
shall
proceed
to
give
the
reader
a
sketch
of
his
history
and
a
description
of
his
establishment
he
was
one
of
that
unfortunate
class
of
discharged
soldiers
who
are
tempted
to
sell
their
pensions
often
far
below
their
true
value
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
lot
of
land
in
some
remote
settlement
where
it
is
only
rendered
valuable
by
the
labour
of
the
settler
and
where
they
will
have
the
unenviable
privilege
of
expending
the
last
remains
of
their
strength
in
clearing
a
patch
of
land
for
the
benefit
of
some
grasping
storekeeper
who
has
given
them
credit
while
engaged
in
the
work
the
old
dragoon
had
fixed
his
abode
on
the
verge
of
an
extensive
which
was
considered
a
sort
of
natural
curiosity
in
the
neighbourhood
and
where
he
managed
by
cutting
the
rank
grass
in
the
summer
time
to
support
several
cows
which
afforded
the
chief
subsistence
of
his
family
he
had
also
managed
with
the
assistance
of
his
devoted
partner
judy
to
clear
a
few
acres
of
poor
rocky
land
on
the
sloping
margin
of
the
level
meadow
which
he
planted
year
after
year
with
potatoes
scattered
over
this
small
clearing
here
and
there
might
be
seen
the
of
some
hemlock
tree
which
had
escaped
the
general
combustion
of
the
log
heaps
and
now
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
white
limestone
rocks
which
showed
their
rounded
surfaces
above
the
meagre
soil
the
ould
dhragoon
seemed
moreover
to
have
some
taste
for
the
picturesque
and
by
way
of
ornament
had
left
standing
sundry
tall
pines
and
hemlocks
neatly
girdled
to
destroy
their
foliage
the
shade
of
which
would
have
been
detrimental
to
the
blessed
praties
which
he
designed
to
grow
in
his
clearing
but
which
in
the
meantime
like
martyrs
at
the
stake
stretched
their
naked
branches
imploringly
towards
the
smiling
heavens
as
he
was
a
kind
of
hermit
from
choice
and
far
removed
from
other
settlers
whose
assistance
is
so
necessary
in
new
settlements
old
simpson
was
compelled
to
resort
to
the
most
extraordinary
contrivances
while
clearing
his
land
thus
after
felling
the
trees
instead
of
chopping
them
into
lengths
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
operation
of
piling
them
preparatory
to
burning
which
would
have
cost
him
too
much
labour
he
resorted
to
the
practice
of
niggering
as
it
is
called
which
is
simply
laying
light
pieces
of
round
timber
across
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
setting
fire
to
them
at
the
point
of
contact
by
which
means
the
trees
are
slowly
burned
through
it
was
while
busily
engaged
in
this
interesting
operation
that
i
first
became
acquainted
with
the
subject
of
this
sketch
some
twenty
or
thirty
little
fires
were
burning
briskly
in
different
parts
of
the
blackened
field
and
the
old
fellow
was
watching
the
slow
progress
of
his
silent
niggers
and
replacing
them
from
time
to
time
as
they
smouldered
away
after
threading
my
way
among
the
uncouth
logs
blazing
and
smoking
in
all
directions
i
encountered
the
old
man
attired
in
an
old
hood
or
bonnet
of
his
wife
judy
with
his
patched
canvas
trousers
rolled
up
to
his
knees
one
foot
bare
and
the
other
furnished
with
an
old
boot
which
from
its
appearance
had
once
belonged
to
some
more
aristocratic
foot
his
person
was
long
straight
and
sinewy
and
there
was
a
light
springiness
and
elasticity
in
his
step
which
would
have
suited
a
younger
man
as
he
skipped
along
with
a
long
handspike
over
his
shoulder
he
was
singing
a
stave
from
the
enniskillen
dragoon
when
i
came
up
with
him
with
his
pistols
and
his
long
carbine
long
life
to
the
brave
inniskillen
his
face
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
lugubrious
imaginable
with
his
long
tangled
hair
hanging
confusedly
over
it
in
a
manner
which
has
been
happily
compared
to
a
bewitched
haystack
had
it
not
been
for
a
certain
humorous
twitch
or
convulsive
movement
which
affected
one
side
of
his
countenance
whenever
any
droll
idea
passed
through
his
mind
it
was
with
a
twitch
of
this
kind
and
a
certain
indescribable
twinkle
of
his
somewhat
melancholy
eye
as
he
seemed
intuitively
to
form
a
hasty
conception
of
the
oddity
of
his
appearance
to
a
stranger
unused
to
the
bush
that
he
welcomed
me
to
his
clearing
he
instantly
threw
down
his
handspike
and
leaving
his
niggers
to
finish
their
work
at
their
leisure
insisted
on
our
going
to
his
house
to
get
something
to
drink
on
the
way
i
explained
to
him
the
object
of
my
visit
which
was
to
mark
out
or
blaze
the
sidelines
of
a
lot
of
land
i
had
received
as
part
of
a
military
grant
immediately
adjoining
the
and
i
asked
him
to
accompany
me
as
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
different
lots
och
by
all
manner
of
manes
and
welcome
the
dhevil
a
foot
of
the
way
but
i
know
as
well
as
my
own
clearing
but
come
into
the
house
and
get
a
dhrink
of
milk
an
a
bite
of
bread
an
butther
for
sorrow
a
dhrop
of
the
whiskey
has
crossed
my
teeth
for
the
last
month
an
it
but
poor
intertainment
for
man
or
baste
i
can
offer
you
but
shure
you
heartily
the
precincts
of
the
homestead
were
divided
and
subdivided
into
an
infinity
of
enclosures
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
the
outer
enclosure
was
a
bush
fence
formed
of
trees
felled
on
each
other
in
a
row
and
the
gaps
filled
up
with
brushwood
there
was
a
large
gate
swung
with
wooden
hinges
and
a
wooden
latch
to
fasten
it
the
smaller
enclosures
were
made
with
round
poles
tied
together
with
bark
the
house
was
of
the
rudest
description
of
shanty
with
hollowed
basswood
logs
fitting
into
each
other
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
tiles
for
a
roof
instead
of
shingles
no
iron
was
to
be
seen
in
the
absence
of
which
there
was
plenty
of
leathern
hinges
wooden
latches
for
locks
and
instead
of
nails
there
was
a
large
fireplace
at
one
end
of
the
shanty
with
a
chimney
constructed
of
split
laths
plastered
with
a
mixture
of
clay
and
cowdung
as
for
windows
these
were
luxuries
which
could
well
be
dispensed
with
the
open
door
was
an
excellent
substitute
for
them
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
none
were
required
when
i
ventured
to
object
to
this
arrangement
that
he
would
have
to
keep
the
door
shut
in
the
winter
time
the
old
man
replied
in
the
style
so
characteristic
of
his
country
shure
it
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
that
when
the
could
weather
sets
everything
about
the
house
wore
a
robinson
crusoe
aspect
and
though
there
was
not
any
appearance
of
original
plan
or
foresight
there
was
no
lack
of
ingenious
contrivance
to
meet
every
want
as
it
arose
judy
dropped
us
a
low
curtsey
as
we
entered
which
was
followed
by
a
similar
compliment
from
a
stout
girl
of
twelve
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
children
who
all
seemed
to
share
the
pleasure
of
their
parents
in
receiving
strangers
in
their
unpretending
tenement
many
were
the
apologies
that
poor
judy
offered
for
the
homely
cheer
she
furnished
us
and
great
was
her
delight
at
the
notice
we
took
of
the
she
set
little
biddy
who
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
reading
the
bible
and
she
took
down
a
curious
machine
from
a
shelf
which
she
had
conthrived
out
of
her
own
head
as
she
said
for
teaching
the
children
to
read
this
was
a
flat
box
or
frame
filled
with
sand
which
saved
paper
pens
and
ink
poor
judy
had
evidently
seen
better
days
but
with
a
humble
and
contented
spirit
she
blessed
god
for
the
food
and
scanty
raiment
their
labour
afforded
them
her
only
sorrow
was
the
want
of
idication
for
the
children
she
would
have
told
us
a
long
story
about
her
trials
and
sufferings
before
they
had
attained
their
present
comparative
comfort
and
independence
but
as
we
had
a
tedious
scramble
before
us
through
and
piny
ridges
the
ould
dhragoon
cut
her
short
and
we
straightway
started
on
our
toilsome
journey
simpson
in
spite
of
a
certain
dash
of
melancholy
in
his
composition
was
one
of
those
happy
fellows
of
the
light
heart
and
thin
pair
of
breeches
school
who
when
they
meet
with
difficulty
or
misfortune
never
stop
to
measure
its
dimensions
but
hold
in
their
breath
and
run
lightly
over
as
in
crossing
a
bog
where
to
stand
still
is
to
sink
off
then
we
went
with
the
ould
dhragoon
skipping
and
bounding
on
before
us
over
fallen
trees
and
mossy
rocks
now
ducking
under
the
low
tangled
branches
of
the
white
cedar
then
carefully
piloting
us
along
rotten
logs
covered
with
green
moss
to
save
us
from
the
discomfort
of
wet
feet
all
this
time
he
still
kept
one
of
his
feet
safely
ensconced
in
the
boot
while
the
other
seemed
to
luxuriate
in
the
water
as
if
there
was
something
amphibious
in
his
nature
we
soon
reached
the
which
extended
two
or
three
miles
sometimes
contracting
into
a
narrow
gorge
between
the
wooded
heights
then
spreading
out
again
into
an
ample
field
of
verdure
and
presenting
everywhere
the
same
unvarying
level
surface
surrounded
with
rising
grounds
covered
with
the
dense
unbroken
forest
as
if
its
surface
had
formerly
been
covered
by
the
waters
of
a
lake
which
in
all
probability
has
been
the
case
at
some
not
very
remote
period
in
many
places
the
meadow
was
so
wet
that
it
required
a
very
large
share
of
faith
to
support
us
in
passing
over
its
surface
but
our
friend
the
dragoon
soon
brought
us
safe
through
all
dangers
to
a
deep
ditch
which
he
had
dug
to
carry
off
the
superfluous
water
from
the
part
of
the
meadow
which
he
owned
when
we
had
obtained
firm
footing
on
the
opposite
side
we
sat
down
to
rest
ourselves
before
commencing
the
operation
of
blazing
or
marking
the
trees
with
our
axes
along
the
of
my
lot
here
the
mystery
of
the
boot
was
explained
simpson
very
coolly
took
it
off
from
the
hitherto
favoured
foot
and
drew
it
on
the
other
he
was
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
his
poverty
and
candidly
owned
that
this
was
the
only
boot
he
possessed
and
he
was
desirous
of
giving
each
of
his
feet
fair
play
nearly
the
whole
day
was
occupied
in
completing
our
job
in
which
the
dhragoon
assisted
us
with
the
most
hearty
enlivening
us
with
his
inexhaustible
fund
of
and
drollery
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
got
back
to
his
shanty
where
the
judy
was
preparing
a
huge
pot
of
potatoes
and
other
combustibles
as
simpson
called
the
other
eatables
for
our
entertainment
previous
to
starting
on
our
surveying
expedition
we
had
observed
judy
very
earnestly
giving
some
important
instructions
to
one
of
her
little
boys
on
whom
she
seemed
to
be
most
seriously
impressing
the
necessity
of
using
the
utmost
diligence
the
happy
contentment
which
now
beamed
in
poor
judy
still
comely
countenance
bespoke
the
success
of
the
messenger
she
could
not
call
up
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
of
the
cellar
but
she
had
procured
some
whiskey
from
her
neighbour
some
five
or
six
miles
off
and
there
it
stood
somewhat
ostentatiously
on
the
table
in
a
greybeard
with
a
corn
cob
or
ear
of
indian
corn
stripped
of
its
grain
for
a
cork
smiling
most
benevolently
on
the
family
circle
and
looking
a
hundred
welcomes
to
the
strangers
an
indescribably
enlivening
influence
seemed
to
exude
from
every
pore
of
that
homely
earthen
vessel
diffusing
mirth
and
in
all
directions
the
old
man
jumped
and
danced
about
on
the
rough
floor
of
the
shanty
and
the
children
sat
giggling
and
nudging
each
other
in
a
corner
casting
a
timid
look
from
time
to
time
at
their
mother
for
fear
she
might
check
them
for
being
over
is
it
crazy
ye
are
intirely
ye
ould
omadhawn
said
judy
whose
notions
of
propriety
were
somewhat
shocked
with
the
undignified
levity
of
her
partner
the
likes
of
you
i
never
seed
ye
are
too
foolidge
intirely
have
done
now
wid
your
diviltries
and
set
the
stools
for
the
gintlemens
while
i
get
the
supper
for
our
plentiful
though
homely
meal
was
soon
discussed
for
hunger
like
a
good
conscience
can
laugh
at
luxury
and
the
greybeard
made
its
appearance
with
the
usual
accompaniments
of
hot
water
and
maple
sugar
which
judy
had
scraped
from
the
cake
and
placed
in
a
saucer
on
the
table
before
us
the
ould
dhragoon
despising
his
wife
admonitions
gave
way
freely
to
his
feelings
and
knew
no
bounds
to
his
hilarity
he
laughed
and
joked
and
sang
snatches
of
old
songs
picked
up
in
the
course
of
his
service
at
home
and
abroad
at
length
judy
who
looked
on
him
as
a
raal
janius
begged
him
to
sing
the
gintlemens
the
song
he
made
when
he
first
came
to
the
of
course
we
ardently
seconded
the
motion
and
nothing
loth
the
old
man
throwing
himself
back
on
his
stool
and
stretching
out
his
long
neck
poured
forth
the
following
ditty

which
i

chapter
xx
disappointed
hopes
stern
disappointment
in
thy
iron
grasp
the
soul
lies
stricken
so
the
timid
deer
who
feels
the
foul
fangs
of
the
felon
wolf
clench
in
his
throat
grown
desperate
for
life
turns
on
his
foes
and
battles
with
the
fate
that
hems
him
in
and
only
yields
in
death
the
summer
of
was
very
wet
a
circumstance
so
unusual
in
canada
that
i
have
seen
no
season
like
it
during
my
sojourn
in
the
country
our
wheat
crop
promised
to
be
both
excellent
and
abundant
and
the
clearing
and
seeding
sixteen
acres
one
way
or
another
had
cost
us
more
than
fifty
pounds
still
we
hoped
to
realise
something
handsome
by
the
sale
of
the
produce
and
as
far
as
appearances
went
all
looked
fair
the
rain
commenced
about
a
week
before
the
crop
was
fit
for
the
sickle
and
from
that
time
until
nearly
the
end
of
september
was
a
mere
succession
of
thunder
showers
days
of
intense
heat
succeeded
by
floods
of
rain
our
fine
crop
shared
the
fate
of
all
other
fine
crops
in
the
country
it
was
totally
spoiled
the
wheat
grew
in
the
sheaf
and
we
could
scarcely
save
enough
to
supply
us
with
bad
sticky
bread
the
rest
was
exchanged
at
the
distillery
for
whiskey
which
was
the
only
produce
which
could
be
obtained
for
it
the
storekeepers
would
not
look
at
it
or
give
either
money
or
goods
for
such
a
damaged
article
my
husband
and
i
had
worked
hard
in
the
field
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
tried
my
hand
at
but
our
ready
money
was
exhausted
and
the
stock
had
not
paid
us
one
farthing
we
could
not
hire
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
a
hard
struggle
with
my
pride
before
i
would
consent
to
render
the
least
assistance
on
the
farm
but
reflection
convinced
me
that
i
was
wrong
that
providence
had
placed
me
in
a
situation
where
i
was
called
upon
to
work
that
it
was
not
only
my
duty
to
obey
that
call
but
to
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
to
assist
my
husband
and
help
to
maintain
my
family
ah
glorious
poverty
thou
art
a
hard
taskmaster
but
in
thy
school
i
have
received
more
godlike
lessons
have
learned
more
sublime
truths
than
ever
i
acquired
in
the
smooth
highways
of
the
world
the
independent
in
soul
can
rise
above
the
seeming
disgrace
of
poverty
and
hold
fast
their
integrity
in
defiance
of
the
world
and
its
selfish
and
unwise
maxims
to
them
no
labour
is
too
great
no
trial
too
severe
they
will
unflinchingly
exert
every
faculty
of
mind
and
body
before
they
will
submit
to
become
a
burden
to
others
the
misfortunes
that
now
crowded
upon
us
were
the
result
of
no
misconduct
or
extravagance
on
our
part
but
arose
out
of
circumstances
which
we
could
not
avert
nor
control
finding
too
late
the
error
into
which
we
had
fallen
in
suffering
ourselves
to
be
cajoled
and
plundered
out
of
our
property
by
interested
speculators
we
braced
our
minds
to
bear
the
worst
and
determined
to
meet
our
difficulties
calmly
and
firmly
nor
suffer
our
spirits
to
sink
under
calamities
which
energy
and
industry
might
eventually
repair
having
once
come
to
this
resolution
we
cheerfully
shared
together
the
labours
of
the
field
one
in
heart
and
purpose
we
dared
remain
true
to
ourselves
true
to
our
high
destiny
as
immortal
creatures
in
our
conflict
with
temporal
and
physical
wants
we
found
that
manual
toil
however
distasteful
to
those
unaccustomed
to
it
was
not
after
all
such
a
dreadful
hardship
that
the
wilderness
was
not
without
its
rose
the
hard
face
of
poverty
without
its
smile
if
we
occasionally
suffered
severe
pain
we
as
often
experienced
great
pleasure
and
i
have
contemplated
a
ridge
of
potatoes
on
that
bush
farm
with
as
much
delight
as
in
years
long
past
i
had
experienced
in
examining
a
fine
painting
in
some
i
can
now
look
back
with
calm
thankfulness
on
that
long
period
of
trial
and
exertion
with
thankfulness
that
the
dark
clouds
that
hung
over
us
threatening
to
blot
us
from
existence
when
they
did
burst
upon
us
were
full
of
blessings
when
our
situation
appeared
perfectly
desperate
then
were
we
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
state
of
things
which
was
born
out
of
that
very
distress
in
order
to
more
fully
illustrate
the
necessity
of
a
perfect
and
reliance
upon
the
mercies
of
god
who
i
most
firmly
believe
never
deserts
those
who
have
placed
their
trust
in
him
i
will
give
a
brief
sketch
of
our
lives
during
the
years
and
still
confidently
expecting
to
realise
an
income
however
small
from
the
stock
we
had
involved
ourselves
considerably
in
debt
in
order
to
pay
our
servants
and
obtain
the
common
necessaries
of
life
and
we
owed
a
large
sum
to
two
englishmen
in
dummer
for
clearing
ten
more
acres
upon
the
farm
our
utter
inability
to
meet
these
demands
weighed
very
heavily
upon
my
husband
mind
all
superfluities
in
the
way
of
groceries
were
now
given
up
and
we
were
compelled
to
rest
satisfied
upon
the
produce
of
the
farm
milk
bread
and
potatoes
during
the
summer
became
our
chief
and
often
for
months
our
only
fare
as
to
tea
and
sugar
they
were
luxuries
we
could
not
think
of
although
i
missed
the
tea
very
much
we
rang
the
changes
upon
peppermint
and
sage
taking
the
one
herb
at
our
breakfast
the
other
at
our
tea
until
i
found
an
excellent
substitute
for
both
in
the
root
of
the
dandelion
the
first
year
we
came
to
this
country
i
met
with
an
account
of
dandelion
coffee
published
in
the
new
york
albion
given
by
a
harrison
of
edinburgh
who
earnestly
recommended
it
as
an
article
of
general
use
it
possesses
he
says
all
the
fine
flavour
and
exhilarating
properties
of
coffee
without
any
of
its
deleterious
effects
the
plant
being
of
a
soporific
nature
the
coffee
made
from
it
when
drunk
at
night
produces
a
tendency
to
sleep
instead
of
exciting
wakefulness
and
may
be
safely
used
as
a
cheap
and
wholesome
substitute
for
the
arabian
berry
being
equal
in
substance
and
flavour
to
the
best
mocha
i
was
much
struck
with
this
paragraph
at
the
time
and
for
several
years
felt
a
great
inclination
to
try
the
doctor
coffee
but
something
or
other
always
came
in
the
way
and
it
was
put
off
till
another
opportunity
during
the
fall
of
i
was
assisting
my
husband
in
taking
up
a
crop
of
potatoes
in
the
field
and
observing
a
vast
number
of
fine
dandelion
roots
among
the
potatoes
it
brought
the
dandelion
coffee
back
to
my
memory
and
i
determined
to
try
some
for
our
supper
without
saying
anything
to
my
husband
i
threw
aside
some
of
the
roots
and
when
we
left
work
collecting
a
sufficient
quantity
for
the
experiment
i
carefully
washed
the
roots
quite
clean
without
depriving
them
of
the
fine
brown
skin
which
covers
them
and
which
contains
the
aromatic
flavour
which
so
nearly
resembles
coffee
that
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
it
from
it
while
roasting
i
cut
my
roots
into
small
pieces
the
size
of
a
and
roasted
them
on
an
iron
in
the
until
they
were
as
brown
and
crisp
as
coffee
i
then
ground
and
transferred
a
small
cupful
of
the
powder
to
the
pouring
upon
it
scalding
water
and
boiling
it
for
a
few
minutes
briskly
over
the
fire
the
result
was
beyond
my
expectations
the
coffee
proved
excellent
far
superior
to
the
common
coffee
we
procured
at
the
stores
to
persons
residing
in
the
bush
and
to
whom
tea
and
coffee
are
very
expensive
articles
of
luxury
the
knowledge
of
this
valuable
property
of
a
plant
scattered
so
abundantly
through
their
fields
would
prove
highly
beneficial
for
years
we
used
no
other
article
and
my
indian
friends
who
frequented
the
house
gladly
adopted
the
root
and
made
me
show
them
the
whole
process
of
manufacturing
it
into
coffee
experience
taught
me
that
the
root
of
the
dandelion
is
not
so
good
when
applied
to
this
purpose
in
the
spring
as
it
is
in
the
fall
i
tried
it
in
the
spring
but
the
juice
of
the
plant
having
contributed
to
the
production
of
leaves
and
flowers
was
weak
and
destitute
of
the
fine
bitter
flavour
so
peculiar
to
coffee
the
time
of
gathering
the
potato
crop
is
the
best
suited
for
collecting
and
drying
the
roots
of
the
dandelion
and
as
they
always
abound
in
the
same
hills
both
may
be
accomplished
at
the
same
time
those
who
want
to
keep
a
quantity
for
winter
use
may
wash
and
cut
up
the
roots
and
dry
them
on
boards
in
the
sun
they
will
keep
for
years
and
can
be
roasted
when
required
few
of
our
colonists
are
acquainted
with
the
many
uses
to
which
this
neglected
but
most
valuable
plant
may
be
applied
i
will
point
out
a
few
which
have
come
under
my
own
observation
convinced
as
i
am
that
the
time
will
come
when
this
hardy
weed
with
its
golden
flowers
and
curious
which
form
a
constant
plaything
to
the
little
children
rolling
about
and
luxuriating
among
the
grass
in
the
sunny
month
of
may
will
be
transplanted
into
our
gardens
and
tended
with
due
care
the
dandelion
planted
in
trenches
and
blanched
to
a
beautiful
with
straw
makes
an
excellent
salad
quite
equal
to
endive
and
is
more
hardy
and
requires
less
care
in
many
parts
of
the
united
states
particularly
in
new
districts
where
vegetables
are
scarce
it
is
used
early
in
the
spring
and
boiled
with
pork
as
a
substitute
for
cabbage
during
our
residence
in
the
bush
we
found
it
in
the
early
part
of
may
a
great
addition
to
the
in
the
township
of
dummer
the
settlers
boil
the
tops
and
add
hops
to
the
liquor
which
they
ferment
and
from
which
they
obtain
excellent
beer
i
have
never
tasted
this
simple
beverage
but
i
have
been
told
by
those
who
use
it
that
it
is
equal
to
the
used
at
home
necessity
has
truly
been
termed
the
mother
of
invention
for
i
contrived
to
manufacture
a
variety
of
dishes
almost
out
of
nothing
while
living
in
her
school
when
entirely
destitute
of
animal
food
the
different
variety
of
squirrels
supplied
us
with
pies
stews
and
roasts
our
barn
stood
at
the
top
of
the
hill
near
the
bush
and
in
a
trap
set
for
such
small
deer
we
often
caught
from
ten
to
twelve
a
day
the
flesh
of
the
black
squirrel
is
equal
to
that
of
the
rabbit
and
the
red
and
even
the
little
chipmunk
is
palatable
when
nicely
cooked
but
from
the
lake
during
the
summer
we
derived
the
larger
portion
of
our
food
the
children
called
this
piece
of
water
mamma
pantry
and
many
a
good
meal
has
the
munificent
father
given
to
his
poor
dependent
children
from
its
depths
moodie
and
i
used
to
rise
at
daybreak
and
fish
for
an
hour
after
sunrise
when
we
returned
he
to
the
field
and
i
to
dress
the
little
ones
clean
up
the
house
assist
with
the
milk
and
prepare
the
breakfast
oh
how
i
enjoyed
these
excursions
on
the
lake
the
very
idea
of
our
dinner
depending
upon
our
success
added
double
zest
to
our
sport
one
morning
we
started
as
usual
before
sunrise
a
thick
mist
still
hung
like
a
fine
veil
upon
the
water
when
we
pushed
off
and
anchored
at
our
accustomed
place
just
as
the
sun
rose
and
the
haze
parted
and
drew
up
like
a
golden
sheet
of
transparent
gauze
through
which
the
dark
woods
loomed
out
like
giants
a
noble
buck
dashed
into
the
water
followed
by
four
indian
hounds
we
then
discovered
a
canoe
full
of
indians
just
below
the
rapids
and
another
not
many
yards
from
us
that
had
been
concealed
by
the
fog
it
was
a
noble
sight
that
gallant
deer
exerting
all
his
energy
and
stemming
the
water
with
such
matchless
grace
his
branching
horns
held
proudly
aloft
his
broad
nostrils
distended
and
his
fine
eye
fixed
intently
upon
the
opposite
shore
several
whizzed
past
him
the
dogs
followed
hard
upon
his
track
but
my
very
heart
leaped
for
joy
when
in
spite
of
all
his
foes
his
glossy
hoofs
spurned
the
opposite
bank
and
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
forest
my
beloved
partner
was
most
skilful
in
trolling
for
bass
and
muskinonge
his
line
he
generally
fastened
to
the
paddle
and
the
motion
of
the
oar
gave
a
vibration
to
the
mice
and
i
used
to
manufacture
from
squirrel
fur
or
scarlet
and
white
cloth
to
tempt
the
finny
wanderers
of
the
wave
when
too
busy
himself
to
fish
for
our
meals
little
katie
and
i
ventured
out
alone
in
the
canoe
which
we
anchored
in
any
promising
fishing
spot
by
fastening
a
harrow
tooth
to
a
piece
of
rope
and
letting
it
drop
from
the
side
of
little
vessel
by
the
time
she
was
five
years
old
my
little
mermaid
could
both
steer
and
paddle
the
light
vessel
and
catch
small
fish
which
were
useful
for
soup
during
the
winter
of
we
experienced
many
privations
the
ruffian
squatter
p
from
clear
lake
drove
from
the
barn
a
fine
young
bull
we
were
rearing
and
for
several
weeks
all
trace
of
the
animal
was
lost
we
had
almost
forgotten
the
existence
of
poor
whiskey
when
a
neighbor
called
and
told
moodie
that
his
yearling
was
at
p
and
that
he
would
advise
him
to
get
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
moodie
had
to
take
some
wheat
to
y
mill
and
as
the
squatter
lived
only
a
mile
further
he
called
at
his
house
and
there
sure
enough
he
found
the
lost
animal
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
regaining
his
property
but
not
without
many
threats
of
vengeance
from
the
parties
who
had
stolen
it
to
these
he
paid
no
regard
but
a
few
days
after
six
fat
hogs
on
which
we
depended
for
all
our
winter
store
of
animal
food
were
driven
into
the
lake
and
destroyed
the
death
of
these
animals
deprived
us
of
three
barrels
of
pork
and
us
through
the
winter
that
winter
of
how
heavily
it
wore
away
the
grown
flour
frosted
potatoes
and
scant
quantity
of
animal
food
rendered
us
all
weak
and
the
children
suffered
much
from
the
ague
one
day
just
before
the
snow
fell
moodie
had
gone
to
peterborough
for
letters
our
servant
was
sick
in
bed
with
the
ague
and
i
was
nursing
my
little
boy
dunbar
who
was
shaking
with
the
cold
fit
of
his
miserable
fever
when
jacob
put
his
honest
round
rosy
face
in
at
the
door
give
me
the
master
gun
there
a
big
buck
feeding
on
the
near
the
i
took
down
the
gun
saying
jacob
you
have
no
chance
there
is
but
one
charge
of
in
the
one
chance
is
better
nor
none
said
jacob
as
he
commenced
loading
the
gun
who
knows
what
may
happen
to
oie
mayhap
oie
may
chance
to
kill
and
you
and
the
measter
and
the
wee
bairns
may
have
zummut
zavory
for
zupper
away
walked
jacob
with
moodie
manton
over
his
shoulder
a
few
minutes
after
i
heard
the
report
of
the
gun
but
never
expected
to
see
anything
of
the
game
when
jacob
suddenly
bounced
into
the
room
with
delight
thae
beast
iz
dead
az
a
zure
how
the
measter
will
laugh
when
he
zees
the
fine
buck
that
oie
and
have
you
really
shot
him
come
and
zee
is
worth
your
while
to
walk
down
to
the
landing
to
look
at
jacob
got
a
rope
and
i
followed
him
to
the
landing
where
sure
enough
lay
a
fine
buck
fastened
in
tow
of
the
canoe
jacob
soon
secured
him
by
the
hind
legs
to
the
rope
he
had
brought
and
with
our
united
efforts
we
at
last
succeeded
in
dragging
our
prize
home
all
the
time
he
was
engaged
in
taking
off
the
skin
jacob
was
anticipating
the
feast
that
we
were
to
have
and
the
good
fellow
chuckled
with
delight
when
he
hung
the
carcass
quite
close
to
the
kitchen
door
that
his
measter
might
run
against
it
when
he
came
home
at
night
this
event
actually
took
place
when
moodie
opened
the
door
he
struck
his
head
against
the
dead
deer
what
have
you
got
here
a
fine
buck
zur
said
jacob
bringing
forward
the
light
and
holding
it
up
in
such
a
manner
that
all
the
merits
of
the
prize
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
a
fine
one
indeed
how
did
we
come
by
it
it
was
zhot
by
oie
said
jacob
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
sort
of
ecstacy
thae
beast
iz
the
first
oie
ever
zhot
in
my
life
he
he
he
you
shot
that
fine
deer
jacob
and
there
was
only
one
charge
in
the
gun
well
done
you
must
have
taken
good
why
zur
oie
took
no
aim
at
all
oie
just
pointed
the
gun
at
the
deer
and
zhut
my
oeys
an
let
fly
at
was
providence
kill
not
i
believe
you
said
moodie
providence
has
hitherto
watched
over
us
and
kept
us
from
actual
the
flesh
of
the
deer
and
the
good
broth
that
i
was
able
to
obtain
from
it
greatly
assisted
in
restoring
our
sick
to
health
but
long
before
that
severe
winter
terminated
we
were
again
out
of
food
had
given
to
katie
in
the
fall
a
very
pretty
little
pig
which
she
had
named
spot
the
animal
was
a
great
favorite
with
jacob
and
the
children
and
he
always
received
his
food
from
their
hands
at
the
door
and
followed
them
all
over
the
place
like
a
dog
we
had
a
noble
hound
called
hector
between
whom
and
the
pet
pig
there
existed
the
most
tender
friendship
spot
always
shared
with
hector
the
hollow
log
which
served
him
for
a
kennel
and
we
often
laughed
to
see
hector
lead
spot
round
the
clearing
by
his
ear
after
bearing
the
want
of
animal
food
until
our
souls
sickened
at
the
bad
potatoes
and
grown
flour
bread
we
began
that
is
the
elders
of
the
family
to
cast
very
hungry
eyes
upon
spot
but
no
one
liked
to
propose
having
him
killed
at
last
jacob
spoke
his
mind
upon
the
subject
oi
heard
zur
that
the
jews
never
eat
pork
but
we
christians
dooz
and
are
right
glad
ov
the
chance
now
zur
oi
been
thinking
that
is
no
manner
ov
use
our
keeping
that
beast
spot
if
he
wor
a
zow
now
there
might
be
zome
zenze
in
the
thing
and
we
all
feel
weak
for
a
morzel
of
meat
i
kill
him
he
make
a
bad
piece
of
moodie
seconded
the
move
and
in
spite
of
the
tears
and
prayers
of
katie
her
uncouth
pet
was
sacrificed
to
the
general
wants
of
the
family
but
there
were
two
members
of
the
house
who
disdained
to
eat
a
morsel
of
the
victim
poor
katie
and
the
dog
hector
at
the
of
the
first
i
did
not
at
all
wonder
for
she
was
a
child
full
of
sensibility
and
warm
affections
but
the
attachment
of
the
brute
creature
to
his
old
playmate
filled
us
all
with
surprise
jacob
first
drew
our
attention
to
the
strange
fact
that
dog
he
said
as
we
were
passing
through
the
kitchen
while
he
was
at
dinner
do
teach
uz
christians
a
lesson
how
to
treat
our
friends
why
zur
he
not
eat
a
morzel
of
spot
oie
have
tried
and
tempted
him
in
all
manner
ov
ways
and
he
only
do
zneer
and
turn
up
his
nose
when
oie
hould
him
a
bit
to
he
offered
the
animal
a
rib
of
the
fresh
pork
as
he
finished
speaking
and
the
dog
turned
away
with
an
expression
of
aversion
and
on
a
repetition
of
the
act
walked
from
the
table
human
affection
could
scarcely
have
surpassed
the
love
felt
by
this
poor
animal
for
his
playfellow
his
attachment
to
spot
that
could
overcome
the
pangs
of
hunger
for
like
the
rest
of
us
he
was
must
have
been
strong
indeed
jacob
attachment
to
us
in
its
simplicity
and
fidelity
greatly
resembled
that
of
the
dog
and
sometimes
like
the
dog
he
would
push
himself
in
where
he
was
not
wanted
and
gratuitously
give
his
advice
and
make
remarks
which
were
not
required
k
from
cork
was
asking
moodie
many
questions
about
the
partidges
of
the
country
and
among
other
things
he
wanted
to
know
by
what
token
you
were
able
to
discover
their
favourite
haunts
before
moodie
could
answer
this
last
query
a
voice
responded
through
a
large
crack
in
the
boarded
wall
which
separated
us
from
the
kitchen
they
always
bides
where
they
this
announcement
was
received
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
greatly
disconcerted
the
natural
philosopher
in
the
kitchen
on
the
of
may
of
this
year
my
second
son
donald
was
born
the
poor
fellow
came
in
hard
times
the
cows
had
not
calved
and
our
bill
of
fare
now
minus
the
deer
and
spot
only
consisted
of
bad
potatoes
and
still
worse
bread
i
was
rendered
so
weak
by
want
of
proper
nourishment
that
my
dear
husband
for
my
sake
overcame
his
aversion
to
borrowing
and
procured
a
quarter
of
mutton
from
a
friend
this
with
kindly
presents
from
neighbours
often
as
badly
off
as
ourselves
a
loin
of
a
young
bear
and
a
basket
containing
a
loaf
of
bread
some
tea
some
fresh
butter
and
oatmeal
went
far
to
save
my
life
shortly
after
my
recovery
jacob
the
faithful
good
jacob
was
obliged
to
leave
us
for
we
could
no
longer
afford
to
pay
wages
what
was
owing
to
him
had
to
be
settled
by
sacrificing
our
best
cow
and
a
great
many
valuable
articles
of
clothing
from
my
wardrobe
nothing
is
more
distressing
than
being
obliged
to
part
with
articles
of
dress
which
you
know
that
you
can
not
replace
almost
all
my
clothes
had
been
appropriated
to
the
payment
of
wages
or
to
obtain
garments
for
the
children
excepting
my
wedding
dress
and
the
beautiful
which
had
been
made
by
the
hands
of
dear
and
affectionate
friends
for
my
these
were
now
exchanged
for
coarse
warm
flannels
to
shield
her
from
the
cold
moodie
and
jacob
had
chopped
eight
acres
during
the
winter
but
these
had
to
be
burnt
off
and
before
we
could
put
in
a
crop
of
wheat
for
the
ensuing
fall
had
we
been
able
to
retain
this
industrious
kindly
english
lad
this
would
have
been
soon
accomplished
but
his
wages
at
the
rate
of
thirty
pounds
per
annum
were
now
utterly
beyond
our
means
jacob
had
formed
an
attachment
to
my
pretty
maid
mary
pine
and
before
going
to
the
southern
states
to
join
an
uncle
who
resided
in
louisville
an
opulent
tradesman
who
had
promised
to
teach
him
his
business
jacob
thought
it
as
well
to
declare
himself
the
declaration
took
place
on
a
log
of
wood
near
the
and
from
my
chamber
window
i
could
both
hear
and
see
the
parties
without
being
myself
observed
mary
was
seated
very
demurely
at
one
end
of
the
log
twisting
the
strings
of
her
checked
apron
and
the
loving
jacob
was
busily
whittling
the
other
extremity
of
their
rustic
seat
there
was
a
long
silence
mary
stole
a
look
at
jacob
and
he
heaved
a
tremendous
sigh
something
between
a
yawn
and
a
groan
meary
he
said

cried
jacob
growing
desperate
at
her
coyness
and
getting
quite
close
up
to
her
will
you
marry
oie
say
yeez
or
noa
this
was
coming
close
to
the
point
mary
drew
farther
from
him
and
turned
her
head
away
meary
said
jacob
seizing
upon
the
hand
that

the
do

and
gave

a
quick
shy
glance
then
burst
out
into
a
simpering
laugh
meary
will

oie
jogging
her
elbow

cried
the
girl
jumping
up
from
the
log
and
running
into
the
house
well
that
bargain
made
said
the
lover
rubbing
his
hands
and
now
oie
go
and
bid
measter
and
missus
the
poor
fellow
eyes
were
full
of
tears
for
the
children
who
loved

very
much
clung
crying
about
his
knees
god
bless
yees
all
sobbed
the
creature
doa

jacob
for
he
neaver
forget

then
turning
to
mary
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
bestowed
upon
her
fair
cheek
the
most
audible
kiss
i
ever

and
doa

back
a
rich
mary
who
was
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
shed
some
tears
at
the
parting
but
in
a
few
days
she
was
as
gay
as
ever
and
listening
with
great
attention
to
the
praises
bestowed
upon
her
beauty
by
an
old
bachelor
who
was
her
senior
by
years
but
then
he
had
a
good
farm
a
saddle
mare
and
plenty
of
stock
and
was
reputed
to
have
saved
money
the
saddle
mare
seemed
to
have
great
weight
in
old

i
used
laughingly
to

mary

absent

the
little
stumpy
man
there
was
a
little
man
i
sketch
him
if
i
can
for
he
clung
to
mine
and
me
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
in
spite
of
taunt
and
scoff
we
could
not
pitch
him
off
for
the
waspish
elf
cared
for
no
one
but
himself
before
i
dismiss
for
ever
the
troubles
and
sorrows
of
i
would
fain
introduce
to
the
notice
of
my
readers
some
of
the
odd
characters
with
whom
we
became
acquainted
during
that
period
the
first
that
starts
vividly
to
my
recollection
is
the
picture
of
a
short
stumpy
thickset
man
a
british
sailor
too
who
came
to
stay
one
night
under
our
roof
and
took
quiet
possession
of
his
quarters
for
nine
months
and
whom
we
were
obliged
to
tolerate
from
the
simple
fact
that
we
could
not
get
rid
of
him
during
the
fall
moodie
had
met
this
individual
whom
i
will
call
malcolm
in
the
going
up
to
toronto
amused
with
his
eccentric
and
blunt
manners
and
finding
him
a
shrewd
clever
fellow
in
conversation
moodie
told
him
that
if
ever
he
came
into
his
part
of
the
world
he
should
be
glad
to
renew
their
acquaintance
and
so
they
parted
with
mutual
as
men
often
part
who
have
travelled
a
long
journey
in
good
fellowship
together
without
thinking
it
probable
they
should
ever
meet
again
the
sugar
season
had
just
commenced
with
the
spring
thaw
jacob
had
tapped
a
few
trees
in
order
to
obtain
sap
to
make
molasses
for
the
children
when
his
plans
were
frustrated
by
the
illness
of
my
husband
who
was
again
attacked
with
the
ague
towards
the
close
of
a
wet
sloppy
day
while
jacob
was
in
the
wood
chopping
and
our
servant
gone
to
my
sister
who
was
ill
to
help
to
wash
as
i
was
busy
baking
bread
for
tea
my
attention
was
aroused
by
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
furious
barking
of
our
dog
hector
i
ran
to
open
it
when
i
found
hector
teeth
clenched
in
the
trousers
of
a
little
dark
thickset
man
who
said
in
a
gruff
voice
call
off
your
dog
what
the
devil
do
you
keep
such
an
infernal
brute
about
the
house
for
is
it
to
bite
people
who
come
to
see
you
hector
was
the
animal
in
the
world
he
might
have
been
called
a
gentlemanly
dog
so
little
was
there
of
the
unmannerly
puppy
in
his
behaviour
that
i
was
perfectly
astonished
at
his
ungracious
conduct
i
caught
him
by
the
collar
and
not
without
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
dragging
him
off

the
stranger
he
is
sir
but
he
is
ill
in
bed
too
ill
to
be
tell
him
a
friend
he
laid
a
strong
stress
upon
the
last
word
a
particular
friend
must
speak
to
i
now
turned
my
eyes
to
the
face
of
the
speaker
with
some
curiosity
i
had
taken
him
for
a
mechanic
from
his
dirty
slovenly
appearance
and
his
physiognomy
was
so
unpleasant
that
i
did
not
credit
his
assertion
that
he
was
a
friend
of
my
husband
for
i
was
certain
that
no
man
who
possessed
such
a
forbidding
aspect
could
be
regarded
by
moodie
as
a
friend
i
was
about
to
deliver
his
message
but
the
moment
i
let
go
hector
collar
the
dog
was
at
him
again
do
strike
him
with
your
stick
i
cried
throwing
my
arms
over
the
faithful
creature
he
is
a
powerful
animal
and
if
you
provoke
him
he
will
kill
i
at
last
succeeded
in
coaxing
hector
into
the
girl
room
where
i
shut
him
up
while
the
stranger
came
into
the
kitchen
and
walked
to
the
fire
to
dry
his
wet
clothes
i
immediately
went
into
the
parlour
where
moodie
was
lying
upon
a
bed
near
the
stove
to
deliver
the
stranger
message
but
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
dashed
in
after
me
and
going
up
to
the
bed
held
out
his
broad
coarse
hand
with
how
are
you
moodie
you
see
i
have
accepted
your
kind
invitation
sooner
than
either
you
or
i
expected
if
you
will
give
me
for
the
night
i
shall
be
obliged
to
this
was
said
in
a
low
mysterious
voice
and
moodie
who
was
still
struggling
with
the
hot
fit
of
his
disorder
and
whose
senses
were
not
a
little
confused
stared
at
him
with
a
look
of
vague
bewilderment
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
grew
dark
you
can
not
have
forgotten
me
my
name
is
yes
sir
i
remember
you
now
said
the
invalid
holding
out
his
burning
feverish
hand
to
my
home
such
as
it
is
you
are
i
stood
by
in
wondering
astonishment
looking
from
one
to
the
other
as
i
had
no
recollection
of
ever
hearing
my
husband
mention
the
name
of
the
stranger
but
as
he
had
invited
him
to
share
our
hospitality
i
did
my
best
to
make
him
welcome
though
in
what
manner
he
was
to
be
accommodated
puzzled
me
not
a
little
i
placed
the
by
the
fire
and
told
him
that
i
would
prepare
tea
for
him
as
soon
as
i
could
it
may
be
as
well
to
tell
you
moodie
said
he
sulkily
for
he
was
evidently
displeased
by
my
husband
want
of
recognition
on
his
first
entrance
that
i
have
had
no
i
sighed
to
myself
for
i
well
knew
that
our
larder
boasted
of
no
dainties
and
from
the
animal
expression
of
our
guest
face
i
rightly
judged
that
he
was
fond
of
good
living
by
the
time
i
had
fried
a
rasher
of
salt
pork
and
made
a
pot
of
dandelion
coffee
the
bread
i
had
been
preparing
was
baked
but
grown
flour
will
not
make
light
bread
and
it
was
unusually
heavy
for
the
first
time
i
felt
heartily
ashamed
of
our
humble
fare
i
was
sure
that
he
for
whom
it
was
provided
was
not
one
to
pass
it
over
in
benevolent
silence
he
might
be
a
gentleman
i
thought
but
he
does
not
look
like
one
and
a
confused
idea
of
who
he
was
and
where
moodie
had
met
him
began
to
float
through
my
mind
i
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
the
man
but
i
consoled
myself
that
he
was
only
to
stay
for
one
night
and
i
could
give
up
my
bed
for
that
one
night
and
sleep
on
a
bed
on
the
floor
by
my
sick
husband
when
i
the
parlour
to
cover
the
table
i
found
moodie
fallen
asleep
and
malcolm
reading
as
i
placed
the
on
the
table
he
raised
his
head
and
regarded
me
with
a
gloomy
stare
he
was
a
creature
his
features
were
tolerably
regular
his
complexion
dark
with
a
good
colour
his
very
broad
and
round
head
was
covered
with
a
perfect
mass
of
close
black
curling
hair
which
in
growth
texture
and
hue
resembled
the
wiry
curly
hide
of
a
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
both
but
gave
by
their
sinister
expression
an
odious
and
doubtful
meaning
to
the
whole
of
his
physiognomy
the
eyes
were
cold
insolent
and
cruel
and
as
green
as
the
eyes
of
a
cat
the
mouth
bespoke
a
sullen
determined
and
sneering
disposition
as
if
it
belonged
to
one
brutally
obstinate
one
who
could
not
by
any
gentle
means
be
persuaded
from
his
purpose
such
a
man
in
a
passion
would
have
been
a
terrible
wild
beast
but
the
current
of
his
feelings
seemed
to
flow
in
a
deep
sluggish
channel
rather
than
in
a
violent
or
impetuous
one
and
like
william
penn
when
he
reconnoitred
his
unwelcome
visitors
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
i
looked
at
my
strange
guest
and
liked
him
not
perhaps
my
distant
and
constrained
manner
made
him
painfully
aware
of
the
fact
for
i
am
certain
that
from
the
first
hour
of
our
acquaintance
a
antipathy
existed
between
us
which
time
seemed
rather
to
strengthen
than
diminish
he
ate
of
his
meal
sparingly
and
with
evident
disgust
the
only
remarks
which
dropped
from
him
were
you
make
bad
bread
in
the
bush
strange
that
you
ca
keep
your
potatoes
from
the
frost
i
should
have
thought
that
you
could
have
had
things
more
comfortable
in
the
we
have
been
very
unfortunate
i
said
since
we
came
to
the
woods
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
obliged
to
share
the
poverty
of
the
land
it
would
have
given
me
much
pleasure
could
i
have
set
before
you
a
more
comfortable
oh
do
mention
it
so
that
i
get
good
pork
and
potatoes
i
shall
be
what
did
these
words
imply
an
extension
of
his
visit
i
hoped
that
i
was
mistaken
but
before
i
could
lose
any
time
in
conjecture
my
husband
awoke
the
fit
had
left
him
and
he
rose
and
dressed
himself
and
was
soon
chatting
cheerfully
with
his
guest
malcolm
now
informed
him
that
he
was
hiding
from
the
sheriff
of
the
n
district
officers
and
that
it
would
be
conferring
upon
him
a
great
favour
if
he
would
allow
him
to
remain
at
his
house
for
a
few
weeks
to
tell
you
the
truth
malcolm
said
moodie
we
are
so
badly
off
that
we
can
scarcely
find
food
for
ourselves
and
the
children
it
is
out
of
our
power
to
make
you
comfortable
or
to
keep
an
additional
hand
without
he
is
willing
to
render
some
little
help
on
the
farm
if
you
can
do
this
i
will
endeavour
to
get
a
few
necessaries
on
credit
to
make
your
stay
more
to
this
proposition
malcolm
readily
assented
not
only
because
it
released
him
from
all
sense
of
obligation
but
because
it
gave
him
a
privilege
to
grumble
finding
that
his
stay
might
extend
to
an
indefinite
period
i
got
jacob
to
construct
a
rude
bedstead
out
of
two
large
chests
that
had
transported
some
of
our
goods
across
the
atlantic
and
which
he
put
in
a
corner
of
the
parlour
this
i
provided
with
a
small
and
furnished
with
what
bedding
i
could
spare
for
the
first
fornight
of
his
sojourn
our
guest
did
nothing
but
lie
upon
that
bed
and
read
and
smoke
and
drink
from
morning
until
night
by
degrees
he
let
out
part
of
his
history
but
there
was
a
mystery
about
him
which
he
took
good
care
never
to
clear
up
he
was
the
son
of
an
officer
in
the
navy
who
had
not
only
attained
a
very
high
rank
in
the
service
but
for
his
gallant
conduct
had
been
made
a
of
the
bath
he
had
himself
served
his
time
as
a
midshipman
on
board
his
but
had
left
the
navy
and
accepted
a
commission
in
the
service
during
the
political
struggles
in
that
province
he
had
commanded
a
sort
of
privateer
under
the
government
to
whom
by
his
own
account
he
had
rendered
many
very
signal
services
why
he
left
south
america
and
came
to
canada
he
kept
a
profound
secret
he
had
indulged
in
very
vicious
and
dissipated
courses
since
he
came
to
the
province
and
by
his
own
account
had
spent
upwards
of
four
thousand
pounds
in
a
manner
not
over
creditable
to
himself
finding
that
his
friends
would
answer
his
bills
no
longer
he
took
possession
of
a
grant
of
land
obtained
through
his
father
interest
up
in
harvey
a
barren
township
on
the
shores
of
stony
lake
and
after
putting
up
his
shanty
and
expending
all
his
remaining
means
he
found
that
he
did
not
possess
one
acre
out
of
the
whole
four
hundred
that
would
yield
a
crop
of
potatoes
he
was
now
considerably
in
debt
and
the
lands
such
as
they
were
had
been
seized
with
all
his
effects
by
the
sheriff
and
a
warrant
was
out
for
his
own
apprehension
which
he
contrived
to
elude
during
his
sojourn
with
us
money
he
had
none
and
beyond
the
dirty
fearnought
blue
seaman
jacket
which
he
wore
a
pair
of
trousers
of
the
coarse
cloth
of
the
country
an
old
black
vest
that
had
seen
better
days
and
two
shirts
clothes
he
had
none
he
shaved
but
once
a
week
never
combed
his
hair
and
never
washed
himself
a
dirtier
or
more
slovenly
creature
never
before
was
dignified
by
the
title
of
a
gentleman
he
was
however
a
man
of
good
education
of
excellent
abilities
and
possessed
a
bitter
sarcastic
knowledge
of
the
world
but
he
was
selfish
and
unprincipled
in
the
highest
degree
his
shrewd
observations
and
great
conversational
powers
had
first
attracted
my
husband
attention
and
as
men
seldom
show
their
bad
qualities
on
a
journey
he
thought
him
a
blunt
good
fellow
who
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
could
render
himself
a
very
agreeable
companion
by
a
graphic
relation
of
his
adventures
he
could
be
all
this
when
he
chose
to
relax
from
his
sullen
morose
mood
and
much
as
i
disliked
him
i
have
listened
with
interest
for
hours
to
his
droll
descriptions
of
south
american
life
and
manners
naturally
indolent
and
a
constitutional
grumbler
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
moodie
could
get
him
to
do
anything
beyond
bringing
a
few
pails
of
water
from
the
swamp
for
the
use
of
the
house
and
he
often
passed
me
carrying
water
up
from
the
lake
without
offering
to
relieve
me
of
the
burden
mary
the
betrothed
of
jacob
called
him
a
perfect
beast
but
he
returning
good
for
evil
considered
a
very
pretty
girl
and
paid
her
so
many
uncouth
attentions
that
he
roused
the
jealousy
of
honest
jake
who
vowed
that
he
would
give
him
a
good
loomping
if
he
only
dared
to
lay
a
finger
upon
his
sweetheart
with
jacob
to
back
her
mary
treated
the
as
jacob
termed
him
with
vast
disdain
and
was
so
saucy
to
him
that
forgetting
his
admiration
he
declared
he
would
like
to
serve
her
as
the
indians
had
done
a
scolding
woman
in
south
america
they
attacked
her
house
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
cut
out
her
tongue
and
nailed
it
to
the
door
by
way
of
knocker
and
he
thought
that
all
women
who
could
not
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
their
head
should
be
served
in
the
same
manner
and
what
should
be
done
to
men
who
swear
and
use
ondacent
language
quoth
mary
indignantly
their
tongues
should
be
slit
and
given
to
the
dogs
faugh
you
are
such
a
nasty
fellow
that
i
do
think
hector
would
eat
your
i
kill
that
beast
muttered
malcolm
as
he
walked
away
i
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
impropriety
of
bandying
words
with
our
servants
you
see
i
said
the
disrespect
with
which
they
treat
you
and
if
they
presume
upon
your
familiarity
to
speak
to
our
guest
in
this
contemptuous
manner
they
will
soon
extend
the
same
conduct
to
but
moodie
you
should
reprove
i
can
not
sir
while
you
continue
by
taking
liberties
with
the
girl
and
swearing
at
the
man
to
provoke
them
to
swearing
what
harm
is
there
in
swearing
a
sailor
can
not
live
without
but
a
gentleman
might
malcolm
i
should
be
sorry
to
consider
you
in
any
other
ah
you
are
such
a
prude
so
methodistical
you
make
no
allowance
for
circumstances
surely
in
the
woods
we
may
dispense
with
the
hypocritical
conventional
forms
of
society
and
speak
and
act
as
we
so
you
seem
to
think
but
you
see
the
i
have
never
been
used
to
the
society
of
ladies
and
i
can
not
fashion
my
words
to
please
them
and
i
wo
that
more
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
strode
off
to
moodie
in
the
field
i
wished
from
my
very
heart
that
he
was
once
more
on
the
deck
of
his
piratical
south
american
craft
one
night
he
insisted
on
going
out
in
the
canoe
to
spear
maskinonge
with
moodie
the
evening
turned
out
very
chill
and
foggy
and
before
twelve
they
returned
with
only
one
fish
and
half
frozen
with
cold
malcolm
had
got
twinges
of
rheumatism
and
he
fussed
and
sulked
and
swore
and
quarrelled
with
everybody
and
everything
until
moodie
who
was
highly
amused
by
his
petulance
advised
him
to
go
to
his
bed
and
pray
for
the
happy
restoration
of
his
temper
temper
he
cried
i
do
believe
there
a
person
in
the
world
it
all
hypocrisy
i
never
had
a
my
mother
was
an
woman
and
ruled
my
father
who
was
a
confoundedly
severe
domineering
man
i
was
born
in
an
i
was
an
child
i
grew
up
an
man
i
feel
worse
than
now
and
when
i
die
it
will
be
in
an
well
quoth
i
moodie
has
made
you
a
tumbler
of
hot
punch
which
may
help
to
drive
out
the
cold
and
the
and
cure
the
ay
your
husband
a
good
fellow
and
worth
two
of
you
moodie
he
makes
some
allowance
for
the
weakness
of
human
nature
and
can
excuse
even
my
i
did
not
choose
to
bandy
words
with
him
and
the
next
day
the
unfortunate
creature
was
shaking
with
the
ague
a
more
intractable
outrageous
i
never
had
the
to
nurse
during
the
cold
fit
he
did
nothing
but
swear
at
the
cold
and
wished
himself
roasting
and
during
the
fever
he
swore
at
the
heat
and
wished
that
he
was
sitting
in
no
other
garment
than
his
shirt
on
the
north
side
of
an
iceberg
and
when
the
fit
at
last
left
him
he
got
up
and
ate
such
quantities
of
fat
pork
and
drank
so
much
that
you
would
have
imagined
he
had
just
arrived
from
a
long
journey
and
had
not
tasted
food
for
a
couple
of
days
he
would
not
believe
that
fishing
in
the
cold
upon
the
water
had
made
him
ill
but
raved
that
it
was
all
my
fault
for
having
laid
my
baby
down
on
his
bed
while
it
was
shaking
with
the
ague
yet
if
there
were
the
least
tenderness
mixed
up
in
his
iron
nature
it
was
the
affection
he
displayed
for
that
young
child
dunbar
was
just
twenty
months
old
with
bright
dark
eyes
dimpled
cheeks
and
soft
flowing
golden
hair
which
fell
round
his
infant
face
in
rich
curls
the
merry
confiding
little
creature
formed
such
a
contrast
to
his
own
surly
unyielding
temper
that
perhaps
that
very
circumstance
made
the
bond
of
union
between
them
when
in
the
house
the
little
boy
was
seldom
out
of
his
arms
and
whatever
were
malcolm
faults
he
had
none
in
the
eyes
of
the
child
who
used
to
cling
around
his
neck
and
kiss
his
rough
unshaven
cheeks
with
the
greatest
fondness
if
i
could
afford
it
moodie
he
said
one
day
to
my
husband
i
should
like
to
marry
i
want
some
one
upon
whom
i
could
vent
my
and
wanting
that
some
one
in
the
form
of
woman
he
contented
himself
with
venting
them
upon
the
child
as
the
spring
advanced
and
after
jacob
left
us
he
seemed
ashamed
of
sitting
in
the
house
doing
nothing
and
therefore
undertook
to
make
us
a
garden
or
to
make
garden
as
the
canadians
term
preparing
a
few
vegetables
for
the
season
i
procured
the
necessary
seeds
and
watched
with
no
small
surprise
the
industry
with
which
our
strange
visitor
commenced
operations
he
repaired
the
broken
fence
dug
the
ground
with
the
greatest
care
and
laid
it
out
with
a
skill
and
neatness
of
which
i
had
believed
him
perfectly
incapable
in
less
than
three
weeks
the
whole
plot
presented
a
very
pleasing
prospect
and
he
was
really
elated
by
his
success
at
any
rate
he
said
we
shall
no
longer
be
starved
on
bad
flour
and
potatoes
we
shall
have
peas
and
beans
and
beets
and
carrots
and
cabbage
in
abundance
besides
the
plot
i
have
reserved
for
cucumbers
and
ah
thought
i
does
he
indeed
mean
to
stay
with
us
until
the
melons
are
ripe
and
my
heart
died
within
me
for
he
not
only
was
a
great
additional
expense
but
he
gave
a
great
deal
of
additional
trouble
and
entirely
robbed
us
of
all
privacy
as
our
very
parlour
was
converted
into
a
for
his
accommodation
besides
that
a
man
of
his
singularly
dirty
habits
made
a
very
disagreeable
inmate
the
only
redeeming
point
in
his
character
in
my
eyes
was
his
love
for
dunbar
i
could
not
entirely
hate
a
man
who
was
so
fondly
attached
to
my
child
to
the
two
little
girls
he
was
very
cross
and
often
chased
them
from
him
with
blows
he
had
too
an
odious
way
of
finding
fault
with
everything
i
never
could
cook
to
please
him
and
he
tried
in
the
most
malicious
way
to
induce
moodie
to
join
in
his
complaints
all
his
schemes
to
make
strife
between
us
however
failed
and
were
generally
visited
upon
himself
in
no
way
did
he
ever
seek
to
render
me
the
least
assistance
shortly
after
jacob
left
us
mary
pine
was
offered
higher
wages
by
a
family
at
peterborough
and
for
some
time
i
was
left
with
four
little
children
and
without
a
servant
moodie
always
milked
the
cows
because
i
never
could
overcome
my
fear
of
cattle
and
though
i
had
occasionally
milked
when
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
way
it
was
in
fear
and
trembling
moodie
had
to
go
down
to
peterborough
but
before
he
went
he
begged
malcolm
to
bring
me
what
water
and
wood
i
required
and
to
stand
by
the
cattle
while
i
milked
the
cows
and
he
would
himself
be
home
before
night
he
started
at
six
in
the
morning
and
i
got
the
pail
to
go
and
milk
malcolm
was
lying
upon
his
bed
reading
mr
malcolm
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
go
with
me
to
the
fields
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
milk
yes
then
with
a
sulky
frown
but
i
want
to
finish
what
i
am
i
will
not
detain
you
oh
no
i
suppose
about
an
hour
you
are
a
shocking
bad
true
i
never
went
near
a
cow
until
i
came
to
this
country
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
overcome
my
fear
of
more
shame
for
you
a
farmer
wife
and
afraid
of
a
cow
why
these
little
children
would
laugh
at
i
did
not
reply
nor
would
i
ask
him
again
i
walked
slowly
to
the
field
and
my
indignation
made
me
forget
my
fear
i
had
just
finished
milking
and
with
a
brimming
pail
was
preparing
to
climb
the
fence
and
return
to
the
house
when
a
very
wild
ox
we
had
came
running
with
headlong
speed
from
the
wood
all
my
fears
were
alive
again
in
a
moment
i
snatched
up
the
pail
and
instead
of
climbing
the
fence
and
getting
to
the
house
i
ran
with
all
the
speed
i
could
command
down
the
steep
hill
towards
the
lake
shore
my
feet
caught
in
a
root
of
the
many
stumps
in
the
path
and
i
fell
to
the
ground
my
pail
rolling
many
yards
of
me
every
drop
of
my
milk
was
spilt
upon
the
grass
the
ox
passed
on
i
gathered
myself
up
and
returned
home
malcolm
was
very
fond
of
new
milk
and
he
came
to
meet
me
at
the
door
hi
hi
where
the
milk
no
milk
for
the
poor
children
said
i
showing
him
the
inside
of
the
pail
with
a
sorrowful
shake
of
the
head
for
it
was
no
small
loss
to
them
and
me
how
the
devil
that
so
you
were
afraid
to
milk
the
cows
come
away
and
i
will
keep
off
the
i
did
milk
them
no
thanks
to
your
kindness
malcolm
but
but
what
the
ox
frightened
me
and
i
fell
and
spilt
all
the
whew
now
do
go
and
tell
your
husband
that
it
was
all
my
fault
if
you
had
had
a
little
patience
i
would
have
come
when
you
asked
me
but
i
do
choose
to
be
dictated
to
and
i
wo
be
made
a
slave
by
you
or
any
one
then
why
do
you
stay
sir
where
you
consider
yourself
so
treated
said
i
we
are
all
obliged
to
work
to
obtain
bread
we
give
you
the
best
share
surely
the
return
we
ask
for
it
is
but
you
make
me
feel
my
obligations
to
you
when
you
ask
me
to
do
anything
if
you
left
it
to
my
better
feelings
we
should
get
on
perhaps
you
are
right
i
will
never
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
me
in
oh
now
that
all
in
spite
of
the
tears
in
your
eyes
you
are
as
angry
with
me
as
ever
but
do
go
to
make
mischief
between
me
and
moodie
if
you
say
nothing
about
my
refusing
to
go
with
you
i
milk
the
cows
for
you
myself
and
can
you
milk
said
i
with
some
curiosity
milk
yes
and
if
i
were
not
so
confoundedly
and
lazy
i
could
do
a
thousand
other
things
too
but
now
do
say
a
word
about
it
to
i
made
no
promise
but
my
respect
for
him
was
not
increased
by
his
cowardly
fear
of
reproof
from
moodie
who
treated
him
with
a
kindness
and
consideration
which
he
did
not
deserve
the
afternoon
turned
out
very
wet
and
i
was
sorry
that
i
should
be
troubled
with
his
company
all
day
in
the
house
i
was
making
a
shirt
for
moodie
from
some
cotton
that
had
been
sent
me
from
home
and
he
placed
himself
by
the
side
of
the
stove
just
opposite
and
continued
to
regard
me
for
a
long
time
with
his
usual
sullen
stare
i
really
felt
half
afraid
of
him
do
you
think
me
mad
said
he
i
have
a
brother
deranged
he
got
a
stroke
of
the
sun
in
india
and
lost
his
senses
in
consequence
but
sometimes
i
think
it
runs
in
the
what
answer
could
i
give
to
this
speech
but
mere
evasive
you
wo
say
what
you
really
think
he
continued
i
know
you
hate
me
and
that
makes
me
dislike
you
now
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
i
had
committed
a
murder
and
that
it
was
the
recollection
of
that
circumstance
that
made
me
at
times
so
restless
and
unhappy
i
looked
up
in
his
face
not
knowing
what
to
believe
is
fact
said
he
nodding
his
head
and
i
hoped
that
he
would
not
go
mad
like
his
brother
and
kill
me
come
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
know
the
world
would
laugh
at
me
for
calling
such
an
act
and
yet
i
have
been
such
a
miserable
man
ever
since
that
i
it
was
there
was
a
noted
leader
among
the
rebel
whom
the
government
wanted
much
to
get
hold
of
he
was
a
fine
dashing
handsome
fellow
i
had
often
seen
him
but
we
never
came
to
close
quarters
one
night
i
was
lying
wrapped
up
in
my
poncho
at
the
bottom
of
my
boat
which
was
rocking
in
the
surf
waiting
for
two
of
my
men
who
were
gone
on
shore
there
came
to
the
shore
this
man
and
one
of
his
people
and
they
stood
so
near
the
boat
that
i
could
distinctly
hear
their
conversation
i
suppose
it
was
the
devil
who
tempted
me
to
put
a
bullet
through
the
man
heart
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
flag
under
which
i
fought
but
he
was
no
enemy
to
me
i
had
no
right
to
become
his
executioner
but
still
the
desire
to
kill
him
for
the
mere
devilry
of
the
thing
came
so
strongly
upon
me
that
i
no
longer
tried
to
resist
it
i
rose
slowly
upon
my
knees
the
moon
was
shining
very
bright
at
the
time
both
he
and
his
companion
were
too
earnestly
engaged
to
see
me
and
i
deliberately
shot
him
through
the
body
he
fell
with
a
heavy
groan
back
into
the
water
but
i
caught
the
last
look
he
threw
upon
the
moonlight
skies
before
his
eyes
glazed
in
death
oh
that
look
so
full
of
despair
of
unutterable
anguish
it
haunts
me
yet
it
will
haunt
me
for
ever
i
would
not
have
cared
if
i
had
killed
him
in
strife
but
in
cold
blood
and
he
so
unsuspicious
of
his
doom
yes
it
was
murder
i
know
by
this
constant
tugging
at
my
heart
that
it
was
murder
what
do
you
say
to
it
i
should
think
as
you
do
malcolm
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
without
the
least
ah
i
knew
you
would
blame
me
but
he
was
an
enemy
after
all
i
had
a
right
to
kill
him
i
was
hired
by
the
government
under
whom
i
served
to
kill
him
and
who
shall
condemn
me
no
one
more
than
your
own
it
is
not
the
heart
but
the
brain
that
must
decide
in
questions
of
right
and
wrong
said
he
i
acted
from
impulse
and
shot
that
man
had
i
reasoned
upon
it
for
five
minutes
the
man
would
be
living
now
but
what
done
can
not
be
undone
did
i
ever
show
you
the
work
i
wrote
upon
south
america
are
you
an
author
said
i
incredulously
to
be
sure
i
am
murray
offered
me
pounds
for
my
manuscript
but
i
would
not
take
it
shall
i
read
to
you
some
passages
from
it
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
his
behaviour
in
the
morning
was
uppermost
in
my
thoughts
and
i
had
no
repugnance
in
refusing
no
do
trouble
yourself
i
have
the
dinner
to
cook
and
the
children
to
attend
to
which
will
cause
a
constant
interruption
you
had
better
defer
it
to
some
other
i
sha
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
again
said
he
with
a
look
of
offended
vanity
but
he
went
to
his
trunk
and
brought
out
a
large
written
on
foolscap
which
he
commenced
reading
to
himself
with
an
air
of
great
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
me
and
smiling
disdainfully
oh
how
glad
i
was
when
the
door
opened
and
the
return
of
moodie
broke
up
this
painful
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
is
but
a
step
the
very
next
day
malcolm
made
his
appearance
before
me
wrapped
in
a
belonging
to
my
husband
which
literally
came
down
to
his
heels
at
this
strange
apparition
i
fell
for
god
sake
moodie
lend
me
a
pair
of
inexpressibles
i
have
met
with
an
accident
in
crossing
the
fence
and
mine
are
torn
to
shreds
gone
to
the
devil
well
do
swear
i
see
what
can
be
done
for
i
brought
him
a
new
pair
of
fine
trousers
that
had
never
been
worn
although
he
was
eloquent
in
his
thanks
i
had
no
idea
that
he
meant
to
keep
them
for
his
sole
individual
use
from
that
day
thenceforth
but
after
all
what
was
the
man
to
do
he
had
no
trousers
and
no
money
and
he
could
not
take
to
the
woods
certainly
his
loss
was
not
our
gain
it
was
the
old
proverb
reversed
the
season
for
putting
in
the
potatoes
had
now
arrived
malcolm
volunteered
to
cut
the
sets
which
was
easy
work
that
could
be
done
in
the
house
and
over
which
he
could
lounge
and
smoke
but
moodie
told
him
that
he
must
take
his
share
in
the
field
that
i
had
already
sets
enough
saved
to
plant
and
would
have
more
prepared
by
the
time
they
were
required
with
many
growls
and
shrugs
he
felt
obliged
to
comply
and
he
performed
his
part
pretty
well
the
execrations
bestowed
upon
the
mosquitoes
and
forming
a
sort
of
to
let
off
the
concentrated
venom
of
his
temper
when
he
came
in
to
dinner
he
held
out
his
hands
to
me
look
at
these
they
are
blistered
with
the
look
at
my
you
are
terribly
disfigured
by
the
but
moodie
suffers
just
as
much
and
says
bah
the
only
consolation
one
feels
for
such
annoyances
is
to
complain
oh
the
woods
the
cursed
woods
how
i
wish
i
were
out
of
the
day
was
very
warm
but
in
the
afternoon
i
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
an
old
maiden
lady
a
friend
of
mine
from
c
she
had
walked
up
with
a
crowe
from
peterborough
a
young
farmer
in
breeches
and
just
out
from
the
old
country
who
naturally
enough
thought
he
would
like
to
roost
among
the
woods
he
was
a
little
lively
manny
with
a
real
face
rosy
high
with
full
lips
and
a
nose
and
like
most
little
men
was
a
great
talker
and
very
full
of
himself
he
had
belonged
to
the
secondary
class
of
farmers
and
was
very
vulgar
both
in
person
and
manners
i
had
just
prepared
tea
for
my
visitors
when
malcolm
and
moodie
returned
from
the
field
there
was
no
affectation
about
the
former
he
was
manly
in
his
person
and
blunt
even
to
rudeness
and
i
saw
by
the
quizzical
look
which
he
cast
upon
the
spruce
little
crowe
that
he
was
quietly
quizzing
him
from
head
to
heel
a
neighbour
had
sent
me
a
present
of
maple
molasses
and
crowe
was
so
fearful
of
spilling
some
of
the
rich
syrup
upon
his
drab
shorts
that
he
spread
a
large
over
his
knees
and
tucked
another
under
his
chin
i
felt
very
much
inclined
to
laugh
but
restrained
the
inclination
as
well
as
i
could
and
if
the
little
creature
would
have
sat
still
i
could
have
quelled
my
rebellious
propensity
altogether
but
up
he
would
jump
at
every
word
i
said
to
him
and
make
me
a
low
jerking
bow
often
with
his
mouth
quite
full
and
the
treacherous
molasses
running
over
his
chin
malcolm
sat
directly
opposite
to
me
and
my
volatile
neighbour
he
saw
the
intense
difficulty
i
had
to
keep
my
gravity
and
was
determined
to
make
me
laugh
out
so
coming
slyly
behind
my
chair
he
whispered
in
my
ear
with
the
gravity
of
a
judge
mrs
moodie
that
must
have
been
the
very
chap
who
first
jumped
jim
this
appeal
obliged
me
to
run
from
the
table
moodie
was
astonished
at
my
rudeness
and
malcolm
as
he
resumed
his
seat
made
the
matter
worse
by
saying
i
wonder
what
is
the
matter
with
moodie
she
is
certainly
very
hysterical
this
the
potatoes
were
planted
and
the
season
of
strawberries
and
young
potatoes
come
but
still
malcolm
remained
our
constant
guest
he
had
grown
so
indolent
and
gave
himself
so
many
airs
that
moodie
was
heartily
sick
of
his
company
and
gave
him
many
gentle
hints
to
change
his
quarters
but
our
guest
was
determined
to
take
no
hint
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
perhaps
out
of
sheer
contradiction
which
formed
one
great
element
in
his
character
he
seemed
obstinately
bent
upon
remaining
where
he
was
moodie
was
busy
for
a
fall
fallow
malcolm
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
garden
or
lounging
about
the
house
i
had
baked
an
for
dinner
which
if
prepared
well
is
by
no
means
an
unsavoury
dish
malcolm
had
cleaned
some
and
washed
the
first
young
potatoes
we
had
drawn
that
season
with
his
own
hands
and
he
was
reckoning
upon
the
feast
he
should
have
on
the
potatoes
with
childish
glee
the
dinner
at
length
was
put
upon
the
table
the
vegetables
were
remarkably
fine
and
the
pie
looked
very
nice
moodie
helped
malcolm
as
he
always
did
very
largely
and
the
other
covered
his
plate
with
a
portion
of
peas
and
potatoes
when
lo
and
behold
my
gentleman
began
making
a
very
wry
face
at
the
pie
what
an
infernal
dish
he
cried
pushing
away
his
plate
with
an
air
of
great
disgust
these
eels
taste
as
if
they
had
been
stewed
in
oil
moodie
you
should
teach
your
wife
to
be
a
better
the
hot
blood
burnt
upon
moodie
cheek
i
saw
indignation
blazing
in
his
eye
if
you
do
like
what
is
prepared
for
you
sir
you
may
leave
the
table
and
my
house
if
you
please
i
will
put
up
with
your
ungentlemanly
and
ungrateful
conduct
to
moodie
no
out
stalked
the
offending
party
i
thought
to
be
sure
we
had
got
rid
of
him
and
though
he
deserved
what
was
said
to
him
i
was
sorry
for
him
moodie
took
his
dinner
quietly
remarking
i
wonder
he
could
find
it
in
his
heart
to
leave
those
fine
peas
and
he
then
went
back
to
his
work
in
the
bush
and
i
cleared
away
the
dishes
and
churned
for
i
wanted
butter
for
tea
about
four
malcolm
entered
the
room
mrs
moodie
said
he
in
a
more
cheerful
voice
than
usual
where
the
boss
in
the
wood
i
felt
dreadfully
afraid
that
there
would
be
blows
between
them
i
hope
malcolm
that
you
are
not
going
to
him
with
any
intention
of
a
fresh
do
you
think
i
have
been
punished
enough
by
losing
my
dinner
said
he
with
a
grin
i
do
think
we
shall
murder
one
he
shouldered
his
axe
and
went
whistling
away
after
striving
for
a
long
while
to
stifle
my
foolish
fears
i
took
the
baby
in
my
arms
and
little
dunbar
by
the
hand
and
ran
up
to
the
bush
where
moodie
was
at
work
at
first
i
only
saw
my
husband
but
the
strokes
of
an
axe
at
a
little
distance
soon
guided
my
eyes
to
the
spot
where
malcolm
was
working
away
as
if
for
dear
life
moodie
smiled
and
looked
at
me
significantly
how
could
the
fellow
stomach
what
i
said
to
him
either
great
necessity
or
great
meanness
must
be
the
cause
of
his
knocking
under
i
do
know
whether
most
to
pity
or
despise
put
up
with
it
dearest
for
this
once
he
is
not
happy
and
must
be
greatly
malcolm
kept
aloof
ever
and
anon
casting
a
furtive
glance
towards
us
at
last
little
dunbar
ran
to
him
and
held
up
his
arms
to
be
kissed
the
strange
man
snatched
him
to
his
bosom
and
covered
him
with
caresses
it
might
be
love
to
the
child
that
had
quelled
his
sullen
spirit
or
he
might
really
have
cherished
an
affection
for
us
deeper
than
his
ugly
temper
would
allow
him
to
show
at
all
events
he
joined
us
at
tea
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
we
might
truly
say
that
he
had
obtained
a
new
lease
of
his
long
visit
but
what
could
not
be
effected
by
words
or
hints
of
ours
was
brought
about
a
few
days
after
by
the
silly
observation
of
a
child
he
asked
katie
to
give
him
a
kiss
and
he
would
give
her
some
raspberries
he
had
gathered
in
the
bush
i
do
want
them
go
away
i
do
like
you
you
little
stumpy
man
his
rage
knew
no
bounds
he
pushed
the
child
from
him
and
vowed
that
he
would
leave
the
house
that
moment
that
she
could
not
have
thought
of
such
an
expression
herself
she
must
have
been
taught
it
by
us
this
was
an
entire
misconception
on
his
part
but
he
would
not
be
convinced
that
he
was
wrong
off
he
went
and
moodie
called
after
him
malcolm
as
i
am
sending
to
peterborough
the
man
shall
take
in
your
he
was
too
angry
even
to
turn
and
bid
us
but
we
had
not
seen
the
last
of
him
yet
two
months
after
we
were
taking
tea
with
a
neighbour
who
lived
a
mile
below
us
on
the
small
lake
who
should
walk
in
but
malcolm
he
greeted
us
with
great
warmth
for
him
and
when
we
rose
to
take
leave
he
rose
and
walked
home
by
our
side
surely
the
little
stumpy
man
is
not
returning
to
his
old
quarters
i
am
still
a
babe
in
the
affairs
of
men
human
nature
has
more
strange
varieties
than
any
one
menagerie
can
contain
and
malcolm
was
one
of
the
oddest
of
her
odd
species
that
night
he
slept
in
his
old
bed
below
the
parlour
window
and
for
three
months
afterwards
he
stuck
to
us
like
a
beaver
he
seemed
to
have
grown
more
kindly
or
we
had
got
more
used
to
his
eccentricities
and
let
him
have
his
own
way
certainly
he
behaved
himself
much
better
he
neither
scolded
the
children
nor
interfered
with
the
maid
nor
quarrelled
with
me
he
had
greatly
discontinued
his
bad
habit
of
swearing
and
he
talked
of
himself
and
his
future
prospects
with
more
hope
and
his
father
had
promised
to
send
him
a
fresh
supply
of
money
and
he
proposed
to
buy
of
moodie
the
clergy
reserve
and
that
they
should
farm
the
two
places
on
shares
this
offer
was
received
with
great
joy
as
an
means
of
paying
our
debts
and
extricating
ourselves
from
present
and
overwhelming
difficulties
and
we
looked
upon
the
little
stumpy
man
in
the
light
of
a
benefactor
so
matters
continued
until
christmas
eve
when
our
visitor
proposed
walking
into
peterborough
in
order
to
give
the
children
a
treat
of
raisins
to
make
a
christmas
pudding
we
will
be
quite
merry
he
said
i
hope
we
shall
eat
many
christmas
dinners
together
and
continue
good
he
started
after
breakfast
with
the
promise
of
coming
back
at
night
but
night
came
the
christmas
passed
away
months
and
years
fled
away
but
we
never
saw
the
little
stumpy
man
again
he
went
away
that
day
with
a
stranger
in
a
waggon
from
peterborough
and
never
afterwards
was
seen
in
that
part
of
canada
we
afterwards
learned
that
he
went
to
texas
and
it
is
thought
that
he
was
killed
at
antonio
but
this
is
mere
conjecture
whether
dead
or
living
i
feel
convinced
that
we
shall
look
upon
his
like
oh
the
days
when
i
was
young
oh
the
days
when
i
was
young
a
playful
little
boy
when
my
piping
treble
rung
to
the
notes
of
early
joy
oh
the
sunny
days
of
spring
when
i
sat
beside
the
shore
and
heard
the
small
birds
sing
shall
i
never
hear
them
more
and
the
daisies
scatter
round
half
hid
amid
the
grass
lay
like
gems
upon
the
ground
too
gay
for
me
to
pass
how
sweet
the
milkmaid
sung
as
she
sat
beside
her
cow
how
clear
her
wild
notes
rung
there
no
music
like
it
now
as
i
watch
the
ship
white
sail
the
sunbeams
on
the
sea
spreading
canvas
to
the
gale
how
i
long
with
her
to
be
i
thought
not
of
the
storm
nor
the
wild
cries
on
her
deck
when
writhed
her
graceful
form
the
hurricane
and
wreck
and
i
launch
my
little
ship
with
her
sails
and
hold
beneath
deep
laden
on
each
trip
with
berries
from
the
heath
ah
little
did
i
know
when
i
long
to
be
a
man
of
the
gloomy
cares
and
woe
that
meet
in
life
brief
span
oh
the
happy
nights
i
lay
with
my
brothers
in
their
beds
where
we
soundly
slept
till
day
shone
brightly
our
heads
and
the
blessed
dreams
that
came
to
fill
my
heart
with
joy
oh
that
i
now
could
dream
as
i
dreamt
a
little
boy
the
sun
shone
brighter
then
and
the
moon
more
soft
and
clear
for
the
wiles
of
crafty
men
i
had
not
learn
to
fear
but
all
seemed
fair
and
gay
as
the
fleecy
clouds
above
i
spent
my
hours
in
play
and
my
heart
was
full
of
love
i
loved
the
hill
and
i
loved
the
silent
vale
with
its
dark
and
purling
rill
that
murmur
in
the
gale
of
sighs
i
none
to
share
they
were
stored
for
riper
years
when
i
drain
the
dregs
of
care
with
many
bitter
tears
my
simple
daily
fare
in
my
little
tiny
mug
how
fain
was
i
to
share
with
cato
on
the
rug
yes
he
gave
his
honest
paw
and
he
lick
my
happy
face
he
was
true
to
nature
law
and
i
thought
it
no
disgrace
there
a
voice
so
soft
and
clear
and
a
step
so
gay
and
light
that
charms
my
listening
ear
in
the
visions
of
the
night
and
my
father
bids
me
haste
in
the
deep
fond
tones
of
love
and
leave
this
dreary
waste
for
brighter
realms
above
now
i
am
old
and
grey
my
bones
are
rack
with
pain
and
time
speeds
fast
away
but
why
should
i
complain
there
are
joys
in
life
young
morn
that
dwell
not
with
the
old
like
the
flowers
the
wind
hath
torn
from
the
strem
all
bleak
and
cold
the
weary
heart
may
mourn
the
wither
hopes
of
youth
but
the
flowers
so
rudely
shorn
still
leave
the
seeds
of
truth
and
there
hope
for
hoary
men
when
they
laid
beneath
the
sod
for
we
all
be
young
again
when
we
meet
around
our
god
chapter
xxii
the
fire
now
fortune
do
thy
worst
for
many
years
thou
with
relentless
and
unsparing
hand
hast
sternly
pour
on
our
devoted
heads
the
poison
phials
of
thy
fiercest
wrath
the
early
part
of
the
winter
of
a
year
never
to
be
forgotten
in
the
annals
of
canadian
history
was
very
severe
during
the
month
of
february
the
thermometer
often
ranged
from
eighteen
to
degrees
below
zero
speaking
of
the
coldness
of
one
particular
day
a
genuine
brother
jonathan
remarked
with
charming
simplicity
that
it
was
thirty
degrees
below
zero
that
morning
and
it
would
have
been
much
colder
if
the
thermometer
had
been
longer
the
morning
of
the
seventh
was
so
intensely
cold
that
everything
liquid
froze
in
the
house
the
wood
that
had
been
drawn
for
the
fire
was
green
and
it
ignited
too
slowly
to
satisfy
the
shivering
impatience
of
women
and
children
i
vented
mine
in
audibly
grumbling
over
the
wretched
fire
at
which
i
in
vain
endeavoured
to
thaw
frozen
bread
and
to
dress
crying
children
it
so
happened
that
an
old
friend
the
maiden
lady
before
alluded
to
had
been
staying
with
us
for
a
few
days
she
had
left
us
for
a
visit
to
my
sister
and
as
some
relatives
of
hers
were
about
to
return
to
britain
by
the
way
of
new
york
and
had
offered
to
convey
letters
to
friends
at
home
i
had
been
busy
all
the
day
before
preparing
a
packet
for
england
it
was
my
intention
to
walk
to
my
sister
with
this
packet
directly
the
important
affair
of
breakfast
had
been
discussed
but
the
extreme
cold
of
the
morning
had
occasioned
such
delay
that
it
was
late
before
the
were
cleared
away
after
dressing
i
found
the
air
so
keen
that
i
could
not
venture
out
without
some
risk
to
my
nose
and
my
husband
kindly
volunteered
to
go
in
my
stead
i
had
hired
a
young
irish
girl
the
day
before
her
friends
were
only
just
located
in
our
vicinity
and
she
had
never
seen
a
stove
until
she
came
to
our
house
after
moodie
left
i
suffered
the
fire
to
die
away
in
the
franklin
stove
in
the
parlour
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
bread
for
the
oven
the
girl
who
was
a
creature
had
heard
me
complain
bitterly
of
the
cold
and
the
impossibility
of
getting
the
green
wood
to
burn
and
she
thought
that
she
would
see
if
she
could
not
make
a
good
fire
for
me
and
the
children
against
my
work
was
done
without
saying
one
word
about
her
intention
she
slipped
out
through
a
door
that
opened
from
the
parlour
into
the
garden
ran
round
to
the
filled
her
lap
with
cedar
chips
and
not
knowing
the
nature
of
the
stove
filled
it
entirely
with
the
light
wood
before
i
had
the
least
idea
of
my
danger
i
was
aroused
from
the
completion
of
my
task
by
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
a
large
fire
and
a
suffocating
smell
of
burning
soot
i
looked
up
at
the
kitchen
all
was
right
there
i
knew
i
had
left
no
fire
in
the
parlour
stove
but
not
being
able
to
account
for
the
smoke
and
the
smell
of
buring
i
opened
the
door
and
to
my
dismay
found
the
stove
red
hot
from
the
front
plate
to
the
topmost
pipe
that
let
out
the
smoke
through
the
roof
my
first
impulse
was
to
plunge
a
blanket
snatched
from
the
servant
bed
which
stood
in
the
kitchen
into
cold
water
this
i
thrust
into
the
stove
and
upon
it
threw
cold
water
until
all
was
cool
below
i
then
ran
up
to
the
loft
and
by
exhausting
all
the
water
in
the
house
even
to
that
contained
in
the
boilers
upon
the
fire
contrived
to
cool
down
the
pipes
which
passed
through
the
loft
i
then
sent
the
girl
out
of
doors
to
look
at
the
roof
which
as
a
very
deep
fall
of
snow
had
taken
place
the
day
before
i
hoped
would
be
completely
covered
and
safe
from
all
danger
of
fire
she
quickly
returned
stamping
and
tearing
her
hair
and
making
a
variety
of
uncouth
outcries
from
which
i
gathered
that
the
roof
was
in
flames
this
was
terrible
news
with
my
husband
absent
no
man
in
the
house
and
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
any
other
habitation
i
ran
out
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
misfortune
and
found
a
large
fire
burning
in
the
roof
between
the
two
stove
pipes
the
heat
of
the
fires
had
melted
off
all
the
snow
and
a
spark
from
the
burning
pipe
had
already
ignited
the
shingles
a
ladder
which
for
several
months
had
stood
against
the
house
had
been
moved
two
days
before
to
the
barn
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
hill
near
the
road
there
was
no
reaching
the
fire
through
that
source
i
got
out
the
and
tried
to
throw
water
upon
the
roof
by
standing
on
a
chair
placed
upon
it
but
i
only
expended
the
little
water
that
remained
in
the
boiler
without
reaching
the
fire
the
girl
still
continued
weeping
and
lamenting
you
must
go
for
help
i
said
run
as
fast
as
you
can
to
my
sister
and
fetch
your
and
lave
you
and
the
childher
alone
wid
the
house
yes
yes
do
stay
one
i
have
no
shoes
and
the
snow
is
so
put
on
your
master
boots
make
haste
or
we
shall
be
lost
before
help
the
girl
put
on
the
boots
and
started
shrieking
fire
the
whole
way
this
was
utterly
useless
and
only
impeded
her
progress
by
exhausting
her
strength
after
she
had
vanished
from
the
head
of
the
clearing
into
the
wood
and
i
was
left
quite
alone
with
the
house
burning
over
my
head
i
paused
one
moment
to
reflect
what
had
best
be
done
the
house
was
built
of
cedar
logs
in
all
probability
it
would
be
consumed
before
any
help
could
arrive
there
was
a
brisk
breeze
blowing
up
from
the
frozen
lake
and
the
thermometer
stood
at
eighteen
degrees
below
zero
we
were
placed
between
the
two
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
and
there
was
as
much
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
one
as
the
other
in
the
bewilderment
of
the
moment
the
direful
extent
of
the
calamity
never
struck
me
we
wanted
but
this
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
our
misfortunes
to
be
thrown
naked
houseless
and
penniless
upon
the
world
what
shall
i
save
first
was
the
thought
just
then
uppermost
in
my
mind
bedding
and
clothing
appeared
the
most
essentially
necessary
and
without
another
moment
pause
i
set
to
work
with
a
right
good
will
to
drag
all
that
i
could
from
my
burning
home
while
little
agnes
dunbar
and
baby
donald
filled
the
air
with
their
cries
katie
as
if
fully
conscious
of
the
importance
of
exertion
assisted
me
in
carrying
out
sheets
and
blankets
and
dragging
trunks
and
boxes
some
way
up
the
hill
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
burning
brands
when
the
roof
should
fall
in
how
many
anxious
looks
i
gave
to
the
head
of
the
clearing
as
the
fire
increased
and
the
large
pieces
of
burning
pine
began
to
fall
through
the
boarded
ceiling
about
the
lower
rooms
where
we
were
at
work
the
children
i
had
kept
under
a
large
dresser
in
the
kitchen
but
it
now
appeared
absolutely
necessary
to
remove
them
to
a
place
of
safety
to
expose
the
young
tender
things
to
the
direful
cold
was
almost
as
bad
as
leaving
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
fire
at
last
i
hit
upon
a
plan
to
keep
them
from
freezing
i
emptied
all
the
clothes
out
of
a
large
deep
chest
of
drawers
and
dragged
the
empty
drawers
up
the
hill
these
i
lined
with
blankets
and
placed
a
child
in
each
drawer
covering
it
well
over
with
the
bedding
giving
to
little
agnes
the
charge
of
the
baby
to
hold
between
her
knees
and
keep
well
covered
until
help
should
arrive
ah
how
long
it
seemed
coming
the
roof
was
now
burning
like
a
and
unconsciously
the
child
and
i
were
working
under
a
shelf
upon
which
were
deposited
several
pounds
of
gunpowder
which
had
been
procured
for
blasting
a
well
as
all
our
water
had
to
be
brought
up
hill
from
the
lake
this
gunpowder
was
in
a
stone
jar
secured
by
a
paper
stopper
the
shelf
upon
which
it
stood
was
on
fire
but
it
was
utterly
forgotten
by
me
at
the
time
and
even
afterwards
when
my
husband
was
working
on
the
burning
loft
over
it
i
found
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
take
many
more
trips
for
goods
as
i
passed
out
of
the
parlour
for
the
last
time
katie
looked
up
at
her
father
flute
which
was
suspended
upon
two
brackets
and
said
oh
dear
mamma
do
save
papa
flute
he
will
be
so
sorry
to
lose
god
bless
the
dear
child
for
the
thought
the
flute
was
saved
and
as
i
succeeded
in
dragging
out
a
heavy
chest
of
cloths
and
looked
up
once
more
despairingly
to
the
road
i
saw
a
man
running
at
full
speed
it
was
my
husband
help
was
at
hand
and
my
heart
uttered
a
deep
thanksgiving
as
another
and
another
figure
came
upon
the
scene
i
had
not
felt
the
intense
cold
although
without
cap
or
bonnet
or
shawl
with
my
hands
bare
and
exposed
to
the
bitter
biting
air
the
intense
excitement
the
anxiety
to
save
all
i
could
had
so
totally
diverted
my
thoughts
from
myself
that
i
had
felt
nothing
of
the
danger
to
which
i
had
been
exposed
but
now
that
help
was
near
my
knees
trembled
under
me
i
felt
giddy
and
faint
and
dark
shadows
seemed
dancing
before
my
eyes
the
moment
my
husband
and
entered
the
house
the
latter
exclaimed
moodie
the
house
is
gone
save
what
you
can
of
your
winter
stores
and
moodie
thought
differently
prompt
and
energetic
in
danger
and
possessing
admirable
presence
of
mind
and
coolness
when
others
yield
to
agitation
and
despair
he
sprang
upon
the
burning
loft
and
called
for
water
alas
there
was
none
snow
snow
hand
me
up
pailsful
of
snow
oh
it
was
bitter
work
filling
those
pails
with
frozen
snow
but
t
and
i
worked
at
it
as
fast
as
we
were
able
the
violence
of
the
fire
was
greatly
checked
by
covering
the
boards
of
the
loft
with
this
snow
more
help
had
now
arrived
young
b
and
s
had
brought
the
ladder
down
with
them
from
the
barn
and
were
already
cutting
away
the
burning
roof
and
flinging
the
flaming
brands
into
the
deep
snow
mrs
moodie
have
you
any
pickled
meat
we
have
just
killed
one
of
our
cows
and
salted
it
for
winter
well
then
fling
the
beef
into
the
snow
and
let
us
have
the
this
was
an
admirable
plan
wherever
the
brine
wetted
the
shingles
the
fire
turned
from
it
and
concentrated
into
one
spot
but
i
had
not
time
to
watch
the
brave
workers
on
the
roof
i
was
fast
yielding
to
the
effects
of
and
fatigue
when
my
brother
team
dashed
down
the
clearing
bringing
my
excellent
old
friend
miss
b
and
the
my
brother
sprang
out
carried
me
back
into
the
house
and
wrapped
me
up
in
one
of
the
large
blankets
scattered
about
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
seated
with
the
dear
children
in
the
sleigh
and
on
the
way
to
a
place
of
warmth
and
safety
katie
alone
suffered
from
the
intense
cold
the
dear
little
creature
feet
were
severely
frozen
but
were
fortunately
restored
by
her
uncle
discovering
the
fact
before
she
approached
the
fire
and
rubbing
them
well
with
snow
in
the
meanwhile
the
friends
we
had
left
so
actively
employed
at
the
house
succeeded
in
getting
the
fire
under
before
it
had
destroyed
the
walls
the
only
accident
that
occurred
was
to
a
poor
dog
that
moodie
had
called
snarleyowe
he
was
struck
by
a
burning
brand
thrown
from
the
house
and
crept
under
the
barn
and
died
beyond
the
damage
done
to
the
building
the
loss
of
our
potatoes
and
two
sacks
of
flour
we
had
escaped
in
a
manner
almost
miraculous
this
fact
shows
how
much
can
be
done
by
persons
working
in
union
without
bustle
and
confusion
or
running
in
each
other
way
here
were
six
men
who
without
the
aid
of
water
succeeded
in
saving
a
building
which
at
first
sight
almost
all
of
them
had
deemed
past
hope
in
after
years
when
entirely
burnt
out
in
a
disastrous
fire
that
consumed
almost
all
we
were
worth
in
the
world
some
four
hundred
persons
were
present
with
a
to
second
their
endeavours
yet
all
was
lost
every
person
seemed
in
the
way
and
though
the
fire
was
discovered
immediately
after
it
took
place
nothing
was
done
beyond
saving
some
of
the
furniture
our
party
was
too
large
to
be
billetted
upon
one
family
t
took
compassion
upon
moodie
myself
and
the
baby
while
their
uncle
received
the
three
children
to
his
hospitable
home
it
was
some
weeks
before
moodie
succeeded
in
repairing
the
roof
the
intense
cold
preventing
any
one
from
working
in
such
an
exposed
situation
the
news
of
our
fire
travelled
far
and
wide
i
was
reported
to
have
done
prodigies
and
to
have
saved
the
greater
part
of
our
household
goods
before
help
arrived
reduced
to
plain
prose
these
prodigies
shrink
into
the
simple
and
by
no
means
marvellous
fact
that
during
the
excitement
i
dragged
out
chests
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
could
not
have
moved
and
that
i
was
unconscious
both
of
the
cold
and
the
danger
to
which
i
was
exposed
while
working
under
a
burning
roof
which
had
it
fallen
would
have
buried
both
the
children
and
myself
under
its
ruins
these
circumstances
appeared
far
more
alarming
as
all
real
danger
does
after
they
were
past
the
fright
and
gave
my
health
a
shock
from
which
i
did
not
recover
for
several
months
and
made
me
so
fearful
of
fire
that
from
that
hour
it
haunts
me
like
a
nightmare
let
the
night
be
ever
so
serene
all
stoves
must
be
shut
up
and
the
hot
embers
covered
with
ashes
before
i
dare
retire
to
rest
and
the
sight
of
a
burning
edifice
so
common
a
spectacle
in
large
towns
in
this
country
makes
me
really
ill
this
feeling
was
greatly
increased
after
a
second
fire
when
for
some
torturing
minutes
a
lovely
boy
since
drowned
was
supposed
to
have
perished
in
the
burning
house
our
present
fire
led
to
a
new
train
of
circumstances
for
it
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
moodie
a
young
irish
gentleman
who
was
staying
at
my
brother
house
john
e
was
one
of
the
best
and
gentlest
of
human
beings
his
father
a
captain
in
the
army
had
died
while
his
family
were
quite
young
and
had
left
his
widow
with
scarcely
any
means
beyond
the
pension
she
received
at
her
death
to
bring
up
and
educate
a
family
of
five
children
a
handsome
showy
woman
e
soon
married
again
and
the
poor
lads
were
thrown
upon
the
world
the
eldest
who
had
been
educated
for
the
church
first
came
to
canada
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
professorship
in
the
college
or
of
opening
a
classical
school
he
was
a
handsome
gentlemanly
young
man
but
constitutionally
indolent
a
natural
defect
which
seemed
common
to
all
the
males
of
the
family
and
which
was
sufficiently
indicated
by
their
soft
silky
fair
hair
and
milky
complexions
r
had
the
good
sense
to
perceive
that
canada
was
not
the
country
for
him
he
spent
a
week
under
our
roof
and
we
were
much
pleased
with
his
elegant
tastes
and
pursuits
but
my
husband
strongly
advised
him
to
try
and
get
a
situation
as
a
tutor
in
some
family
at
home
this
he
afterwards
obtained
he
became
tutor
and
travelling
companion
to
the
young
lord
m
and
has
since
got
an
excellent
living
john
who
had
followed
his
brother
to
canada
without
the
means
of
transporting
himself
back
again
was
forced
to
remain
and
was
working
with
s
for
his
board
he
proposed
to
moodie
working
his
farm
upon
shares
and
as
we
were
unable
to
hire
a
man
moodie
gladly
closed
with
his
offer
and
during
the
time
he
remained
with
us
we
had
every
reason
to
be
pleased
with
the
arrangement
it
was
always
a
humiliating
feeling
to
our
proud
minds
that
hirelings
should
witness
our
dreadful
struggle
with
poverty
and
the
strange
shifts
we
were
forced
to
make
in
order
to
obtain
even
food
but
john
e
had
known
and
experienced
all
that
we
had
suffered
in
his
own
person
and
was
willing
to
share
our
home
with
all
its
privations
sincere
and
truly
affectionate
a
gentleman
in
word
thought
and
deed
we
found
his
society
and
cheerful
help
a
great
comfort
our
odd
meals
became
a
subject
of
merriment
and
the
peppermint
and
sage
tea
drank
with
a
better
flavour
when
we
had
one
who
sympathised
in
all
our
trials
and
shared
all
our
toils
to
partake
of
it
with
us
the
whole
family
soon
became
attached
to
our
young
friend
and
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
over
greatly
we
enjoyed
an
fishing
on
the
lake
john
e
said
that
we
had
no
right
to
murmur
as
long
as
we
had
health
a
happy
home
and
plenty
of
fresh
fish
milk
and
potatoes
early
in
may
we
received
an
old
irishwoman
into
our
service
who
for
four
years
proved
a
most
faithful
and
industrious
creature
and
what
with
john
e
to
assist
my
husband
on
the
farm
and
old
jenny
to
help
me
to
nurse
the
children
and
manage
the
house
our
affairs
if
they
were
no
better
in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
at
least
presented
a
more
pleasing
aspect
at
home
we
were
always
cheerful
and
sometimes
contented
and
even
happy
how
great
was
the
contrast
between
the
character
of
our
new
inmate
and
that
of
malcolm
the
sufferings
of
the
past
year
had
been
greatly
increased
by
the
intolerable
nuisance
of
his
company
while
many
additional
debts
had
been
contracted
in
order
to
obtain
luxuries
for
him
which
we
never
dreamed
of
purchasing
for
ourselves
instead
of
increasing
my
domestic
toils
john
did
all
in
his
power
to
lessen
them
and
it
always
grieved
him
to
see
me
iron
a
shirt
or
wash
the
least
article
of
clothing
for
him
you
have
too
much
to
do
already
i
can
not
bear
to
give
you
the
least
additional
work
he
would
say
and
he
generally
expressed
the
greatest
satisfaction
at
my
method
of
managing
the
house
and
preparing
our
simple
fare
the
little
ones
he
treated
with
the
most
affectionate
kindness
and
gathered
the
whole
flock
about
his
knees
the
moment
he
came
in
to
his
meals
on
a
wet
day
when
no
work
could
be
done
abroad
moodie
took
up
his
flute
or
read
aloud
to
us
while
john
and
i
sat
down
to
work
the
young
emigrant
early
cast
upon
the
world
and
his
own
resources
was
an
excellent
hand
at
the
needle
he
would
make
or
mend
a
shirt
with
the
greatest
precision
and
neatness
and
cut
out
and
manufacture
his
canvas
trousers
and
loose
with
as
much
adroitness
as
the
most
experienced
tailor
darn
his
socks
and
mend
his
boots
and
shoes
and
often
volunteered
to
assist
me
in
knitting
the
coarse
yarn
of
the
country
into
socks
for
the
children
while
he
made
them
moccasins
from
the
dressed
that
we
obtained
from
the
indians
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
in
his
person
the
only
thing
which
seemed
to
ruffle
his
calm
temper
was
the
dirty
work
of
logging
he
hated
to
come
in
from
the
field
with
his
person
and
clothes
begrimed
with
charcoal
and
smoke
old
jenny
used
to
laugh
at
him
for
not
being
able
to
eat
his
meals
without
first
washing
his
hands
and
face
och
my
dear
heart
yer
too
particular
intirely
we
no
time
in
the
woods
to
be
she
would
say
to
him
in
answer
to
his
request
for
soap
and
a
towel
an
is
it
soap
yer
i
tell
yer
that
that
same
is
not
to
the
fore
bating
the
throuble
of
makin
it
little
soap
that
the
misthress
can
get
to
wash
the
clothes
for
us
and
the
childher
widout
yer
wastin
it
in
yer
purty
skin
as
white
as
a
leddy
do
darlint
go
down
to
the
lake
and
wash
there
that
basin
is
big
enough
any
and
john
would
laugh
and
go
down
to
the
lake
to
wash
in
order
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
old
woman
john
had
a
great
dislike
to
cats
and
even
regarded
with
an
evil
eye
our
old
pet
cat
peppermint
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
share
his
bed
and
board
if
i
tolerate
our
own
cat
he
would
say
i
will
not
put
up
with
such
a
nuisance
as
your
friend
emilia
sends
us
in
the
shape
of
her
ugly
tom
why
where
in
the
world
do
you
think
i
found
that
beast
sleeping
last
night
i
expressed
my
ignorance
in
our
now
you
will
agree
with
me
that
potatoes
dressed
with
cat
hair
is
not
a
very
nice
dish
the
next
time
i
catch
master
tom
in
the
i
will
kill
john
you
are
not
in
earnest
would
never
forgive
any
injury
done
to
tom
who
is
a
great
let
her
keep
him
at
home
then
think
of
the
brute
coming
a
mile
through
the
woods
to
steal
from
us
all
he
can
find
and
then
sleeping
off
the
effects
of
his
depredations
in
the
i
could
not
help
laughing
but
i
begged
john
by
no
means
to
annoy
emilia
by
hurting
her
cat
the
next
day
while
sitting
in
the
parlour
at
work
i
heard
a
dreadful
squall
and
rushed
to
the
rescue
john
was
standing
with
a
flushed
cheek
grasping
a
large
stick
in
his
hand
and
tom
was
lying
dead
at
his
feet
oh
the
poor
cat
yes
i
have
killed
him
but
i
am
sorry
for
it
now
what
will
say
she
must
not
know
it
i
have
told
you
the
story
of
the
pig
that
jacob
killed
you
had
better
bury
it
with
the
john
was
really
sorry
for
having
yielded
in
a
fit
of
passion
to
do
so
cruel
a
thing
yet
a
few
days
after
he
got
into
a
fresh
scrape
with
animals
the
hens
were
laying
up
at
the
barn
john
was
very
fond
of
fresh
eggs
but
some
strange
dog
came
daily
and
sucked
the
eggs
john
had
vowed
to
kill
the
first
dog
he
found
in
the
act
had
a
very
fine
which
he
valued
very
highly
but
with
emilia
chowder
was
an
especial
favourite
bitterly
had
she
bemoaned
the
fate
of
tom
and
many
were
the
inquiries
she
made
of
us
as
to
his
sudden
disappearance
one
afternoon
john
ran
into
the
room
my
dear
moodie
what
is
dog
like
a
large
brindled
black
and
then
by
jove
i
shot
him
john
john
you
mean
me
to
quarrel
in
earnest
with
my
friend
how
could
you
do
it
why
how
the
deuce
should
i
know
her
dog
from
another
i
caught
the
big
thief
in
the
very
act
of
devouring
the
eggs
from
under
your
sitting
hen
and
i
shot
him
dead
without
another
thought
but
i
will
bury
him
and
she
will
never
find
it
out
a
bit
more
than
she
did
who
killed
the
some
time
after
this
emilia
returned
from
a
visit
at
p
the
first
thing
she
told
me
was
the
loss
of
the
dog
she
was
so
vexed
at
it
she
had
had
him
advertised
offering
a
reward
for
his
recovery
i
of
course
was
called
upon
to
sympathise
with
her
which
i
did
with
a
very
bad
grace
i
did
not
like
the
beast
i
said
he
was
cross
and
fierce
and
i
was
afraid
to
go
up
to
her
house
while
he
was
yes
but
to
lose
him
so
it
is
so
provoking
and
him
such
a
valuable
animal
i
could
not
tell
how
deeply
she
felt
the
loss
she
would
give
four
dollars
to
find
out
who
had
stolen
how
near
she
came
to
making
the
grand
discovery
the
sequel
will
show
instead
of
burying
him
with
the
murdered
pig
and
cat
john
had
scratched
a
shallow
grave
in
the
garden
and
concealed
the
dead
brute
after
tea
emilia
requested
to
look
at
the
garden
and
i
perfectly
unconscious
that
it
contained
the
remains
of
the
murdered
chowder
led
the
way
whilst
gathering
a
handful
of
fine
suddenly
stooped
and
looking
earnestly
at
the
ground
called
to
me
come
here
susanna
and
tell
me
what
has
been
buried
here
it
looks
like
the
tail
of
a
she
might
have
added
of
my
murder
it
seems
will
out
by
some
strange
chance
the
grave
that
covered
the
mortal
remains
of
chowder
had
been
disturbed
and
the
black
tail
of
the
dog
was
sticking
out
what
can
it
be
said
i
with
an
air
of
perfect
innocence
shall
i
call
jenny
and
dig
it
up
oh
no
my
dear
it
has
a
shocking
smell
but
it
does
look
very
much
like
chowder
impossible
how
could
it
come
among
my
peas
true
besides
i
saw
chowder
with
my
own
eyes
yesterday
following
a
team
and
george
c
hopes
to
recover
him
for
indeed
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
how
these
mosquitoes
sting
shall
we
go
back
to
the
house
while
we
returned
to
the
house
john
who
had
overheard
the
whole
conversation
hastily
disinterred
the
body
of
chowder
and
placed
him
in
the
same
mysterious
grave
with
tom
and
the
pig
moodie
and
his
friend
finished
the
eight
acres
which
the
former
had
cleared
the
previous
winter
besides
putting
in
a
crop
of
peas
and
potatoes
and
an
acre
of
indian
corn
reserving
the
fallow
for
fall
wheat
while
we
had
the
promise
of
a
splendid
crop
of
hay
off
the
sixteen
acres
that
had
been
cleared
in
we
were
all
in
high
spirits
and
everything
promised
fair
until
a
very
trifling
circumstance
again
occasioned
us
much
anxiety
and
trouble
and
was
the
cause
of
our
losing
most
of
our
crop
moodie
was
asked
to
attend
a
bee
which
was
called
to
construct
a
over
a
very
bad
piece
of
road
he
and
e
were
obliged
to
go
that
morning
with
wheat
to
the
mill
but
moodie
lent
his
yoke
of
oxen
for
the
work
the
driver
selected
for
them
at
the
bee
was
the
brutal
m
y
a
man
noted
for
his
of
cattle
especially
if
the
animals
did
not
belong
to
him
he
gave
one
of
the
oxen
such
a
severe
blow
over
the
loins
with
a
handspike
that
the
creature
came
home
perfectly
disabled
just
as
we
wanted
his
services
in
the
and
harvest
moodie
had
no
money
to
purchase
or
even
to
hire
a
mate
for
the
other
ox
but
he
and
john
hoped
that
by
careful
attendance
upon
the
injured
animal
he
might
be
restored
to
health
in
a
few
days
they
conveyed
him
to
a
deserted
clearing
a
short
distance
from
the
farm
where
he
would
be
safe
from
injury
from
the
rest
of
the
cattle
and
early
every
morning
we
went
in
the
canoe
to
carry
poor
duke
a
warm
mash
and
to
watch
the
progress
of
his
recovery
ah
ye
who
revel
in
this
world
wealth
how
little
can
you
realise
the
importance
which
we
in
our
poverty
attached
to
the
life
of
this
valuable
animal
yes
it
even
became
the
subject
of
prayer
for
the
bread
for
ourselves
and
our
little
ones
depended
greatly
upon
his
recovery
we
were
doomed
to
disappointment
after
nursing
him
with
the
greatest
attention
and
care
for
some
weeks
the
animal
grew
daily
worse
and
suffered
such
intense
agony
as
he
lay
groaning
upon
the
ground
unable
to
rise
that
john
shot
him
to
put
him
out
of
pain
here
then
were
we
left
without
oxen
to
draw
in
our
hay
or
secure
our
other
crops
a
neighbour
who
had
an
odd
ox
kindly
lent
us
the
use
of
him
when
he
was
not
employed
on
his
own
farm
and
john
and
moodie
gave
their
own
work
for
the
occasional
loan
of
a
yoke
of
oxen
for
a
day
but
with
all
these
drawbacks
and
in
spite
of
the
assistance
of
old
jenny
and
myself
in
the
field
a
great
deal
of
the
produce
was
damaged
before
it
could
be
secured
the
whole
summer
we
had
to
labour
under
this
disadvantage
our
neighbours
were
all
too
busy
to
give
us
any
help
and
their
own
teams
were
employed
in
saving
their
crops
fortunately
the
few
acres
of
wheat
we
had
to
reap
were
close
to
the
barn
and
we
carried
the
sheaves
thither
by
hand
old
jenny
proving
an
invaluable
help
both
in
the
harvest
and
still
with
all
these
misfortunes
providence
watched
over
us
in
a
signal
manner
we
were
never
left
entirely
without
food
like
the
widow
cruise
of
oil
our
means
though
small
were
never
suffered
to
cease
entirely
we
had
been
for
some
days
without
meat
when
moodie
came
running
in
for
his
gun
a
great
was
in
the
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
very
busily
employed
in
helping
to
harvest
the
crop
there
was
but
one
bullet
and
a
charge
or
two
of
buckshot
in
the
house
but
moodie
started
to
the
wood
with
the
single
bullet
in
his
gun
followed
by
a
little
terrier
dog
that
belonged
to
john
e
old
jenny
was
busy
at
the
but
the
moment
she
saw
her
master
running
up
the
clearing
and
knew
the
cause
she
left
her
work
and
snatching
up
the
ran
after
him
that
in
case
the
bear
should
have
the
best
of
the
fight
she
would
be
there
to
help
the
finding
her
shoes
incommode
her
she
flung
them
off
in
order
to
run
faster
a
few
minutes
after
came
the
report
of
the
gun
and
i
heard
moodie
halloo
to
e
who
was
cutting
stakes
for
a
fence
in
the
wood
i
hardly
thought
it
possible
that
he
could
have
killed
the
bear
but
i
ran
to
the
door
to
listen
the
children
were
all
excitement
which
the
sight
of
the
black
monster
borne
down
the
clearing
upon
two
poles
increased
to
the
wildest
demonstrations
of
joy
moodie
and
john
were
carrying
the
prize
and
old
jenny
brandishing
her
followed
in
the
rear
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
skinning
and
cutting
up
and
salting
the
ugly
creature
whose
flesh
filled
a
barrel
with
excellent
meat
in
flavour
resembling
beef
while
the
short
grain
and
juicy
nature
of
the
flesh
gave
to
it
the
tenderness
of
mutton
this
was
quite
a
godsend
and
lasted
us
until
we
were
able
to
kill
two
large
fat
hogs
in
the
fall
a
few
nights
after
moodie
and
i
encountered
the
mate
of
bruin
while
returning
from
a
visit
to
emilia
in
the
very
depth
of
the
wood
we
had
been
invited
to
meet
our
friend
father
and
mother
who
had
come
up
on
a
short
visit
to
the
woods
and
the
evening
passed
away
so
pleasantly
that
it
was
near
midnight
before
the
little
party
of
friends
separated
the
moon
was
down
the
wood
through
which
we
had
to
return
was
very
dark
the
ground
being
low
and
swampy
and
the
trees
thick
and
tall
there
was
in
particular
one
very
ugly
spot
where
a
small
creek
crossed
the
road
this
creek
could
only
be
passed
by
scrambling
over
a
fallen
tree
which
in
a
dark
night
was
not
very
easy
to
find
i
begged
a
torch
of
but
no
torch
could
be
found
emilia
laughed
at
my
fears
still
knowing
what
a
coward
i
was
in
the
bush
of
a
night
she
found
up
about
an
inch
of
candle
which
was
all
that
remained
from
the
evening
entertainment
this
she
put
into
an
old
lanthorn
it
will
not
last
you
long
but
it
will
carry
you
over
the
this
was
something
gained
and
off
we
set
it
was
so
dark
in
the
bush
that
our
dim
candle
looked
like
a
solitary
red
spark
in
the
intense
surrounding
darkness
and
scarcely
served
to
show
us
the
path
we
went
chatting
along
talking
over
the
news
of
the
evening
hector
running
on
before
us
when
i
saw
a
pair
of
eyes
glare
upon
us
from
the
edge
of
the
swamp
with
the
green
bright
light
emitted
by
the
eyes
of
a
cat
did
you
see
those
terrible
eyes
moodie
and
i
clung
trembling
to
his
arm
what
eyes
said
he
feigning
ignorance
it
too
dark
to
see
anything
the
light
is
nearly
gone
and
if
you
do
quicken
your
pace
and
cross
the
tree
before
it
goes
out
you
will
perhaps
get
your
feet
wet
by
falling
into
the
good
heavens
i
saw
them
again
and
do
just
look
at
the
hector
stopped
suddenly
and
stretching
himself
along
the
ground
his
nose
resting
between
his
forepaws
began
to
whine
and
tremble
presently
he
ran
back
to
us
and
crept
under
our
feet
the
cracking
of
branches
and
the
heavy
tread
of
some
large
animal
sounded
close
beside
us
moodie
turned
the
open
lanthorn
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
sounds
came
and
shouted
as
loud
as
he
could
at
the
same
time
endeavouring
to
urge
forward
the
dog
whose
cowardice
was
only
equalled
by
my
own
just
at
that
critical
moment
the
wick
of
the
candle
flickered
a
moment
in
the
socket
and
expired
we
were
left
in
perfect
darkness
alone
with
the
bear
for
such
we
supposed
the
animal
to
be
my
heart
beat
audibly
a
cold
perspiration
was
streaming
down
my
face
but
i
neither
shrieked
nor
attempted
to
run
i
do
know
how
moodie
got
me
over
the
creek
one
of
my
feet
slipped
into
the
water
but
expecting
as
i
did
every
moment
to
be
devoured
by
master
bruin
that
was
a
thing
of
no
consequence
my
husband
was
laughing
at
my
fears
and
every
now
and
then
he
turned
towards
our
companion
who
continued
following
us
at
no
great
distance
and
gave
him
an
encouraging
shout
glad
enough
was
i
when
i
saw
the
gleam
of
the
light
from
our
little
cabin
window
shine
out
among
the
trees
and
the
moment
i
got
within
the
clearing
i
ran
without
stopping
until
i
was
safely
within
the
house
john
was
sitting
up
for
us
nursing
donald
he
listened
with
great
interest
to
our
adventure
with
the
bear
and
thought
that
bruin
was
very
good
to
let
us
escape
without
one
affectionate
hug
perhaps
it
would
have
been
otherwise
had
he
known
moodie
that
you
had
not
only
killed
his
good
lady
but
were
dining
sumptuously
off
her
carcass
every
the
bear
was
determined
to
have
something
in
return
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
several
nights
after
this
our
slumbers
were
disturbed
about
midnight
by
an
awful
yell
and
old
jenny
shook
violently
at
our
chamber
door
masther
masther
dear
get
up
wid
you
this
moment
or
the
bear
will
desthroy
the
cattle
half
asleep
moodie
sprang
from
his
bed
seized
his
gun
and
ran
out
i
threw
my
large
cloak
round
me
struck
a
light
and
followed
him
to
the
door
the
moment
the
latter
was
unclosed
some
calves
that
we
were
rearing
rushed
into
the
kitchen
closely
followed
by
the
larger
beasts
who
came
bellowing
headlong
down
the
hill
pursued
by
the
bear
it
was
a
laughable
scene
as
shown
by
that
paltry
moodie
in
his
taking
aim
at
something
in
the
darkness
surrounded
by
the
terrified
animals
old
jenny
with
a
large
knife
in
her
hand
holding
on
to
the
white
skirts
of
her
master
garment
making
outcry
loud
enough
to
frighten
away
all
the
wild
beasts
in
the
bush
herself
almost
in
a
state
of
nudity
och
masther
dear
do
timpt
the
crathur
wid
charging
too
near
think
of
the
wife
and
the
childher
let
me
come
at
the
rampaging
baste
an
i
stick
the
knife
into
the
heart
of
moodie
fired
the
bear
retreated
up
the
clearing
with
a
low
growl
moodie
and
jenny
pursued
him
some
way
but
it
was
too
dark
to
discern
any
object
at
a
distance
i
for
my
part
stood
at
the
open
door
laughing
until
the
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
at
the
glaring
eyes
of
the
oxen
their
ears
erect
and
their
tails
carried
gracefully
on
a
level
with
their
backs
as
they
stared
at
me
and
the
light
in
blank
astonishment
the
noise
of
the
gun
had
just
roused
john
e
from
his
slumbers
he
was
no
less
amused
than
myself
until
he
saw
that
a
fine
yearling
heifer
was
bleeding
and
found
upon
examination
that
the
poor
animal
having
been
in
the
claws
of
the
bear
was
dangerously
if
not
mortally
hurt
i
hope
he
cried
that
the
brute
has
not
touched
my
foal
i
pointed
to
the
black
face
of
the
filly
peeping
over
the
back
of
an
elderly
cow
you
see
john
that
bruin
preferred
veal
there
your
as
dunbar
calls
her
safe
and
laughing
at
moodie
and
jenny
now
returned
from
the
pursuit
of
the
bear
e
fastened
all
the
cattle
into
the
back
yard
close
to
the
house
by
daylight
he
and
moodie
had
started
in
chase
of
bruin
whom
they
tracked
by
his
blood
some
way
into
the
bush
but
here
he
entirely
escaped
their
search
the
bears
of
canada
oh
me
from
this
savage
land
of
for
is
indeed
to
me
i
rather
cope
with
vilest
worldly
cares
or

cruel
sickness

all
at

pour
through
the

waters
can
the
slave
who
lures
his
wretched
followers
with
the
hope
of
gain
feel
in
his
bosom
the
immortal
fire
that
bound
a
wallace
to
his
country
cause
and
bade
the
thracian
shepherd
cast
away
rome
galling
yoke
while
the
astonish
world
rapt
into
admiration
at
the
deed
paus
ere
she
crush
with
overwhelming
force
the
man
who
fought
to
win
a
glorious
grave
the
harvest
was
at
length
brought
to
a
close
moodie
had
procured
another
ox
from
dummer
by
giving
a
note
at
six
months
date
for
the
payment
and
he
and
john
e
were
in
the
middle
of
sowing
their
fall
crop
of
wheat
when
the
latter
received
a
letter
from
the
old
country
which
conveyed
to
him
intelligence
of
the
death
of
his
mother
and
of
a
legacy
of
two
hundred
pounds
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
return
to
claim
the
property
and
though
we
felt
his
loss
severely
we
could
not
without
great
selfishness
urge
him
to
stay
john
had
formed
an
attachment
to
a
young
lady
in
the
country
who
like
himself
possessed
no
property
their
engagement
which
had
existed
several
years
had
been
dropped
from
its
utter
hopelessness
by
mutual
consent
still
the
young
people
continued
to
love
each
other
and
to
look
forward
to
better
days
when
their
prospects
might
improve
so
far
that
e
would
be
able
to
purchase
a
bush
farm
and
raise
a
house
however
lowly
to
shelter
his
mary
he
like
our
friend
malcolm
had
taken
a
fancy
to
buy
a
part
of
our
block
of
land
which
he
could
cultivate
in
partnership
with
moodie
without
being
obliged
to
hire
when
the
same
barn
cattle
and
implements
would
serve
for
both
anxious
to
free
himself
from
the
thraldom
of
debts
which
pressed
him
sore
moodie
offered
to
part
with
two
hundred
acres
at
less
than
they
cost
us
and
the
bargain
was
to
be
considered
as
concluded
directly
the
money
was
forthcoming
it
was
a
sorrowful
day
when
our
young
friend
left
us
he
had
been
a
constant
inmate
in
the
house
for
nine
months
and
not
one
unpleasant
word
had
ever
passed
between
us
he
had
rendered
our
sojourn
in
the
woods
more
tolerable
by
his
society
and
sweetened
our
bitter
lot
by
his
friendship
and
sympathy
we
both
regarded
him
as
a
brother
and
parted
with
him
with
sincere
regret
as
to
old
jenny
she
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
consigning
him
to
the
care
and
protection
of
all
the
saints
in
the
irish
calendar
for
several
days
after
john
left
us
a
deep
gloom
pervaded
the
house
our
daily
toil
was
performed
with
less
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
we
missed
him
at
the
evening
board
and
at
the
evening
fire
and
the
children
asked
each
day
with
increasing
earnestness
when
dear
e
would
return
moodie
continued
sowing
his
fall
wheat
the
task
was
nearly
completed
and
the
chill
october
days
were
fast
verging
upon
winter
when
towards
the
evening
of
one
of
them
he
contrived
i
know
not
how
to
crawl
down
from
the
field
at
the
head
of
the
hill
faint
and
pale
and
in
great
pain
he
had
broken
the
small
bone
of
his
leg
in
dragging
among
the
stumps
the
heavy
machine
which
is
made
in
the
form
of
the
letter
v
and
is
supplied
with
large
iron
teeth
had
hitched
upon
a
stump
and
being
swung
off
again
by
the
motion
of
the
oxen
had
come
with
great
force
against
his
leg
at
first
he
was
struck
down
and
for
some
time
was
unable
to
rise
but
at
length
he
contrived
to
unyoke
the
team
and
crawled
partly
on
his
hands
and
knees
down
the
clearing
what
a
sad
melancholy
evening
that
was
fortune
seemed
never
tired
of
playing
us
some
ugly
trick
the
hope
which
had
so
long
sustained
me
seemed
about
to
desert
me
altogether
when
i
saw
him
on
whom
we
all
depended
for
subsistence
and
whose
kindly
voice
ever
cheered
us
under
the
pressure
of
calamity
smitten
down
helpless
all
my
courage
and
faith
in
the
goodness
of
the
divine
father
seemed
to
forsake
me
and
i
wept
long
and
bitterly
the
next
morning
i
went
in
search
of
a
messenger
to
send
to
peterborough
for
the
doctor
but
though
i
found
and
sent
the
messenger
the
doctor
never
came
perhaps
he
did
not
like
to
incur
the
expense
of
a
fatiguing
journey
with
small
chance
of
obtaining
a
sufficient
remuneration
our
dear
sufferer
contrived
with
assistance
to
bandage
his
leg
and
after
the
first
week
of
rest
had
expired
he
amused
himself
with
making
a
pair
of
crutches
and
in
manufacturing
indian
paddles
for
the
canoe
and
yokes
for
the
oxen
it
was
wonderful
with
what
serenity
he
bore
this
unexpected
affliction
buried
in
the
obscurity
of
those
woods
we
knew
nothing
heard
nothing
of
the
political
state
of
the
country
and
were
little
aware
of
the
revolution
which
was
about
to
work
a
great
change
for
us
and
for
canada
the
weather
continued
remarkably
mild
the
first
great
snow
which
for
years
had
ordinarily
fallen
between
the
and
of
november
still
kept
off
november
passed
on
and
as
all
our
firewood
had
to
be
chopped
by
old
jenny
during
the
lameness
of
my
husband
i
was
truly
grateful
to
god
for
the
continued
mildness
of
the
weather
on
the
of
december
that
great
day
of
the
outbreak
moodie
was
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
open
state
of
the
lake
to
carry
a
large
grist
up
to
y
mill
i
urged
upon
him
the
danger
of
a
man
attempting
to
manage
a
canoe
in
rapid
water
who
was
unable
to
stand
without
crutches
but
moodie
saw
that
the
children
would
need
bread
and
he
was
anxious
to
make
the
experiment
finding
that
i
could
not
induce
him
to
give
up
the
journey
i
determined
to
go
with
him
old
wittals
who
happened
to
come
down
that
morning
assisted
in
placing
the
bags
of
wheat
in
the
little
vessel
and
helped
to
place
moodie
at
the
stern
with
a
sad
foreboding
spirit
i
assisted
to
push
off
from
the
shore
the
air
was
raw
and
cold
but
our
sail
was
not
without
its
pleasure
the
lake
was
very
full
from
the
heavy
rains
and
the
canoe
bounded
over
the
waves
with
a
free
springy
motion
a
slight
frost
had
hung
every
little
bush
and
spray
along
the
shores
with
sparkling
crystals
the
red
shining
through
their
coating
of
ice
looked
like
cornelian
beads
set
in
silver
and
strung
from
bush
to
bush
we
found
the
rapids
at
the
entrance
of
bessikakoon
lake
very
hard
to
stem
and
were
so
often
carried
back
by
the
force
of
the
water
that
cold
as
the
air
was
the
great
exertion
which
moodie
had
to
make
use
of
to
obtain
the
desired
object
brought
the
perspiration
out
in
big
drops
upon
his
forehead
his
long
confinement
to
the
house
and
low
diet
had
rendered
him
very
weak
the
old
miller
received
us
in
the
most
hearty
and
hospitable
manner
and
complimented
me
upon
my
courage
in
venturing
upon
the
water
in
such
cold
rough
weather
norah
was
married
but
the
kind
betty
provided
us
an
excellent
dinner
while
we
waited
for
the
grist
to
be
ground
it
was
near
four
when
we
started
on
our
return
if
there
had
been
danger
in
going
up
the
stream
there
was
more
in
coming
down
the
wind
had
changed
the
air
was
frosty
keen
and
biting
and
moodie
paddle
came
up
from
every
dip
into
the
water
loaded
with
ice
for
my
part
i
had
only
to
sit
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
as
we
floated
rapidly
down
with
wind
and
tide
at
the
landing
we
were
met
by
old
jenny
who
had
a
long
story
to
tell
us
of
which
we
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
how
some
gentleman
had
called
during
our
absence
and
left
a
large
paper
all
about
the
queen
and
the
yankees
that
there
was
war
between
canada
and
the
states
that
toronto
had
been
burnt
and
the
governor
killed
and
i
know
not
what
other
strange
and
monstrous
statements
after
much
fatigue
moodie
climbed
the
hill
and
we
were
once
more
safe
by
our
own
fireside
here
we
found
the
elucidation
of
jenny
marvelous
tales
a
copy
of
the
queen
proclamation
calling
upon
all
loyal
gentlemen
to
join
in
putting
down
the
unnatural
rebellion
a
letter
from
my
sister
explained
the
nature
of
the
outbreak
and
the
astonishment
with
which
the
news
had
been
received
by
all
the
settlers
in
the
bush
my
brother
and
my
sister
husband
had
already
gone
off
to
join
some
of
the
numerous
bands
of
gentlemen
who
were
collecting
from
all
quarters
to
march
to
the
aid
of
toronto
which
it
was
said
was
besieged
by
the
rebel
force
she
advised
me
not
to
suffer
moodie
to
leave
home
in
his
present
weak
state
but
the
spirit
of
my
husband
was
aroused
he
instantly
obeyed
what
he
considered
the
imperative
call
of
duty
and
told
me
to
prepare
him
a
few
necessaries
that
he
might
be
ready
to
start
early
in
the
morning
little
sleep
visited
our
eyes
that
night
we
talked
over
the
strange
news
for
hours
our
coming
separation
and
the
probability
that
if
things
were
as
bad
as
they
appeared
to
be
we
might
never
meet
again
our
affairs
were
in
such
a
desperate
condition
that
moodie
anticipated
that
any
change
must
be
for
the
better
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
be
worse
but
the
poor
anxious
wife
thought
only
of
a
parting
which
to
her
put
a
finishing
stroke
to
all
her
misfortunes
before
the
cold
snowy
morning
broke
we
were
all
stirring
the
children
who
had
learned
that
their
father
was
preparing
to
leave
them
were
crying
and
clinging
round
his
knees
his
heart
was
too
deeply
affected
to
eat
the
meal
passed
over
in
silence
and
he
rose
to
go
i
put
on
my
hat
and
shawl
to
accompany
him
through
the
wood
as
far
as
my
sister
t
the
day
was
like
our
destiny
cold
dark
and
lowering
i
gave
the
dear
invalid
his
crutches
and
we
commenced
our
sorrowful
walk
then
old
jenny
lamentations
burst
forth
as
flinging
her
arms
round
my
husband
neck
she
kissed
and
blessed
him
after
the
fashion
of
her
country
och
hone
och
hone
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
masther

and

what

of
the
wife
and
the
wee
bairns
her
cries
and
lamentations
followed
us
into
the
wood
at
my
sister
moodie
and
i
parted
and
with
a
heavy
heart
i
retraced
my
steps
through
the
wood
for
once
i
forgot
all
my
fears
i
never
felt
the
cold
sad
tears
were
flowing
over
my
cheeks
when
i
entered
the
house
hope
seemed
to
have
deserted
me
and
for
upwards
of
an
hour
i
lay
upon
the
bed
and
wept
poor
jenny
did
her
best
to
comfort
me
but
all
joy
had
vanished
with
him
who
was
my
light
of
life
left
in
the
most
absolute
uncertainty
as
to
the
real
state
of
public
affairs
i
could
only
conjecture
what
might
be
the
result
of
this
sudden
outbreak
several
poor
settlers
called
at
the
house
during
the
day
on
their
way
down
to
peterborough
but
they
brought
with
them
the
most
exaggerated
accounts
there
had
been
a
battle
they
said
with
the
rebels
and
the
loyalists
had
been
defeated
toronto
was
besieged
by
sixty
thousand
men
and
all
the
men
in
the
backwoods
were
ordered
to
march
instantly
to
the
relief
of
the
city
in
the
evening
i
received
a
note
from
emilia
who
was
at
peterborough
in
which
she
informed
me
that
my
husband
had
borrowed
a
horse
of
s
and
had
joined
a
large
party
of
two
hundred
volunteers
who
had
left
that
morning
for
toronto
that
there
had
been
a
battle
with
the
insurgents
that
colonel
moodie
had
been
killed
and
the
rebels
had
retreated
and
that
she
hoped
my
husband
would
return
in
a
few
days
the
honest
backwoodsman
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
abuses
that
had
led
to
the
present
position
of
things
regarded
the
rebels
as
a
set
of
monsters
for
whom
no
punishment
was
too
severe
and
obeyed
the
call
to
arms
with
enthusiasm
the
leader
of
the
insurgents
must
have
been
astonished
at
the
rapidity
with
which
a
large
force
was
collected
as
if
by
magic
to
repel
his
designs
a
great
number
of
these
volunteers
were
officers
many
of
whom
had
fought
in
the
continental
wars
with
the
armies
of
napoleon
and
would
have
been
found
a
host
in
themselves
i
must
own
that
my
british
spirit
was
fairly
aroused
and
as
i
could
not
aid
in
subduing
the
enemies
of
my
beloved
country
with
my
arm
i
did
what
little
i
could
to
serve
the
good
cause
with
my
pen
it
may
probably
amuse
my
readers
to
give
them
a
few
specimens
of
these
loyal
staves
which
were
widely
circulated
through
the
colony
at
the
time
an
address
to
the
freemen
of
canada
canadians
will
you
join
the
band
the
factious
band
who

oppose
the
regal
power

your
boasted
freedom
flows
brave
children
of
a
noble
race
guard
well
the
altar
and
the
hearth
and
never
by
your
deeds
disgrace
the
british
sires
who
gave
you
birth
what
though
your
bones
may
never
lie
beneath
dear
albion
hallow
sod
spurn
the
base

who
dare
defy
in

his
country

his
god
whose
callous
bosom
can
not
feel
that
he
who
acts
a
traitor
part
remorselessly
uplifts
the
steel
to
plunge
it
in
a
parent
heart
canadians
will
you
see
the
flag
beneath
whose
folds
your
fathers
bled
supplanted
by
the
vilest
rag
that
ever
host
to

led
thou
emblem
of
a
tyrant
sway
thy
triple
hues
are
dyed
in
gore
like
his
thy

pass
away
like

thy
triumph
ay
let
the
trampled
despot
fate
forewarn
the
rash
misguided
band
to
sue
for
mercy
ere
too
late
nor
scatter
ruin
the
land
the
baffled
traitor
doomed
to
bear
a
people
hate
his

defeated
by
his

curse
the
hour
that

glorious
to

good
cause
securely

your
cry
and
crush
the
traitors
to

dust
the
flag
assumed
by
the
rebels
this
outpouring
of
a
national
enthusiasm
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
restrain
was
followed
by
the
oath
of
the
canadian
volunteers
huzza
for
england
may
she
claim
our
fond
devotion
ever
and
by
the
glory
of
her
name
our
brave
forefathers
honest
fame
we
swear
no
foe
shall
sever
her
children
from
their
parent
side
though
parted
by
the
wave
in
weal
or
woe
betide
we
swear
to
die
or
save
her
honour
from
the
rebel
band
whose
crimes
pollute
our
injured
land
let
the
foe
come
we
will
not
shrink
to
meet
them
if
they
dare
well
must
they
fight
ere
rashly
think
to
rend
apart
one
sacred
link
that
binds
our
country
fair
to
that
dear
isle
from
whence
we
sprung
which
gave
our
fathers
birth
whose
glorious
deeds
her
bards
have
sung
the
unrivall
of
the
earth
the
highest
privilege
we
claim
to
own
her
sway
to
bear

died
of
old
our
sires
in
a
week
moodie
returned
so
many
volunteers
had
poured
into
toronto
that
the
number
of
friends
was
likely
to
prove
as
disastrous
as
that
of
enemies
on
account
of
the
want
of
supplies
to
maintain
them
all
the
companies
from
the
back
townships
had
been
remanded
and
i
received
with
delight
my
own
again
but
this
did
not
last
long
several
regiments
of
militia
were
formed
to
defend
the
colony
and
to
my
husband
was
given
the
rank
of
captain
in
one
of
those
then
stationed
in
toronto
on
the
of
january
he
bade
us
a
long
adieu
i
was
left
with
old
jenny
and
the
children
to
take
care
of
the
farm
it
was
a
sad
dull
time
i
could
bear
up
against
all
trials
with
him
to
comfort
and
cheer
me
but
his
absence
cast
a
gloom
upon
my
spirit
not
easily
to
be
shaken
off
still
his
very
appointment
to
this
situation
was
a
signal
act
of
mercy
from
his
full
pay
he
was
enabled
to
liquidate
many
pressing
debts
and
to
send
home
from
time
to
time
sums
of
money
to
procure
necessaries
for
me
and
the
little
ones
these
remittances
were
greatly
wanted
but
i
demurred
before
laying
them
out
for
comforts
which
we
had
been
so
long
used
to
dispense
with
it
seemed
almost
criminal
to
purchase
any
article
of
luxury
such
as
tea
or
sugar
while
a
debt
remained
unpaid
the
y
y
were
very
pressing
for
the
thirty
pounds
that
we
owed
them
for
the
clearing
but
they
had
such
a
firm
reliance
upon
the
honour
of
my
husband
that
poor
and
pressed
for
money
as
they
were
they
never
sued
us
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasing
surprise
to
moodie
if
with
the
sums
of
money
which
i
occasionally
received
from
him
i
could
diminish
this
debt
which
had
always
given
him
the
greatest
uneasiness
and
my
resolution
once
formed
i
would
not
allow
any
temptation
to
shake
it
the
money
was
always
transmitted
to
dummer
i
only
reserved
the
sum
of
two
dollars
a
month
to
pay
a
little
lad
to
chop
wood
for
us
after
a
time
i
began
to
think
the
y
y
were
gifted
with
secondsight
for
i
never
received
a
but
the
very
next
day
i
was
sure
to
see
some
of
the
family
just
at
this
period
i
received
a
letter
from
a
gentleman
requesting
me
to
write
for
a
magazine
the
literary
garland
just
started
in
montreal
with
promise
to
remunerate
me
for
my
labours
such
an
application
was
like
a
gleam
of
light
springing
up
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
to
promise
the
dawning
of
a
brighter
day
i
had
never
been
able
to
turn
my
thoughts
towards
literature
during
my
sojourn
in
the
bush
when
the
body
is
fatigued
with
labour
unwonted
and
beyond
its
strength
the
mind
is
in
no
condition
for
mental
occupation
the
year
before
i
had
been
requested
by
an
american
author
of
great
merit
to
contribute
to
the
north
american
review
published
for
several
years
in
philadelphia
and
he
promised
to
remunerate
me
in
proportion
to
the
success
of
the
work
i
had
contrived
to
write
several
articles
after
the
children
were
asleep
though
the
expense
even
of
the
stationery
and
the
postage
of
the
manuscripts
was
severely
felt
by
one
so
destitute
of
means
but
the
hope
of
being
of
the
least
service
to
those
dear
to
me
cheered
me
to
the
task
i
never
realised
anything
from
that
source
but
i
believe
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
editor
several
other
american
editors
had
written
to
me
to
furnish
them
with
articles
but
i
was
unable
to
pay
the
postage
of
heavy
packets
to
the
states
and
they
could
not
reach
their
destination
without
being
paid
to
the
frontier
thus
all
chance
of
making
anything
in
that
way
had
been
abandoned
i
wrote
to
l
and
frankly
informed
him
how
i
was
situated
in
the
most
liberal
manner
he
offered
to
pay
the
postage
on
all
manuscripts
to
his
office
and
left
me
to
name
my
own
terms
of
remuneration
this
opened
up
a
new
era
in
my
existence
and
for
many
years
i
have
found
in
this
generous
man
to
whom
i
am
still
personally
unknown
a
steady
friend
i
actually
shed
tears
of
joy
over
the
first
bill
i
received
from
montreal
it
was
my
own
i
had
earned
it
with
my
own
hand
and
it
seemed
to
my
delighted
fancy
to
form
the
nucleus
out
of
which
a
future
independence
for
my
family
might
arise
i
no
longer
retired
to
bed
when
the
labours
of
the
day
were
over
i
sat
up
and
wrote
by
the
light
of
a
strange
sort
of
candles
that
jenny
called
sluts
and
which
the
old
woman
manufactured
out
of
pieces
of
old
rags
twisted
together
and
dipped
in
pork
lard
and
stuck
in
a
bottle
they
did
not
give
a
bad
light
but
it
took
a
great
many
of
them
to
last
me
for
a
few
hours
the
faithful
old
creature
regarded
my
writings
with
a
jealous
eye
an
shure
it
killin
yerself
that
you
are
intirely
you
were
thin
enough
before
you
took
to
the
pen
scribblin
an
when
you
should
be
in
bed
an
asleep
what
good
will
it
be
to
the
childhren
dear
heart
if
you
die
afore
your
time
by
wastin
your
strength
afther
that
fashion
jenny
never
could
conceive
the
use
of
books
sure
we
can
live
and
die
widout
them
it
only
a
waste
of
time
botherin
your
brains
wid
the
like
of
them
but
thanks
goodness
the
lard
will
soon
be
all
done
an
thin
we
shall
hear
you
spakin
again
instead
of
there
doubled
up
all
night
desthroying
your
eyes
wid
porin
over
the
dirthy
as
the
season
drew
near
jenny
conceived
the
bold
thought
of
making
a
good
lump
of
sugar
that
the
childher
might
have
something
to
ate
with
their
bread
during
the
summer
we
had
no
but
a
neighbour
promised
to
lend
us
his
and
to
give
us
troughs
on
condition
that
we
gave
him
half
the
sugar
we
made
these
terms
were
rather
hard
but
jenny
was
so
anxious
to
fulfil
the
darling
object
that
we
consented
little
sol
and
the
old
woman
made
some
fifty
troughs
more
the
trees
were
duly
tapped
a
shanty
in
the
bush
was
erected
of
small
logs
and
brush
and
covered
in
at
the
top
with
straw
and
the
old
woman
and
solomon
the
hired
boy
commenced
operations
the
very
first
day
a
terrible
accident
happened
to
us
a
large
log
fell
upon
the
the
borrowed
and
cracked
it
spilling
all
the
sap
and
rendering
the
vessel
which
had
cost
four
dollars
useless
we
were
all
in
dismay
just
at
that
time
old
wittals
happened
to
pass
on
his
way
to
peterborough
he
very
offered
to
get
the
kettle
repaired
for
us
which
he
said
could
be
easily
done
by
a
rivet
and
an
iron
hoop
but
where
was
the
money
to
come
from
i
thought
awhile
katie
had
a
magnificent
coral
and
bells
the
gift
of
her
godfather
i
asked
the
dear
child
if
she
would
give
it
to
buy
another
kettle
for
t
she
said
i
would
give
ten
times
as
much
to
help
i
wrote
a
little
note
to
emilia
who
was
still
at
her
father
and
w
the
storekeeper
sent
us
a
fine
back
by
wittals
and
also
the
other
mended
in
exchange
for
the
useless
piece
of
finery
we
had
now
two
kettles
at
work
to
the
joy
of
jenny
who
declared
that
it
was
a
lucky
fairy
who
had
broken
the
old
kettle
while
jenny
was
engaged
in
boiling
and
gathering
the
sap
in
the
bush
i
sugared
off
the
syrup
in
the
house
an
operation
watched
by
the
children
with
intense
interest
after
standing
all
day
over
the
hot
it
was
quite
a
refreshment
to
breathe
the
pure
air
at
night
every
evening
i
ran
up
to
see
jenny
in
the
bush
singing
and
boiling
down
the
sap
in
the
front
of
her
little
shanty
the
old
woman
was
in
her
element
and
afraid
of
nothing
under
the
stars
she
slept
beside
her
kettles
at
night
and
snapped
her
fingers
at
the
idea
of
the
least
danger
she
was
sometimes
rather
despotic
in
her
treatment
of
her
attendant
sol
one
morning
in
particular
she
bestowed
upon
the
lad
a
severe
cuffing
i
ran
up
the
clearing
to
the
rescue
when
my
ears
were
assailed
by
the
of
the
boy
what
has
happened
why
do
you
beat
the
child
jenny
it
jist
thin
i
that
will
bate
him
the
unlucky
omadhawn
has
not
he
spilt
and
spiled
two
buckets
of
syrup
that
i
have
been
the
night
bilin
sorra
wid
him
i
like
to
strip
the
skin
off
him
i
would
musha
but
is
enough
to
vex
a
ah
jenny
blubbered
the
poor
boy
but
you
have
no
mercy
you
forget
that
i
have
but
one
eye
and
that
i
could
not
see
the
root
which
caught
my
foot
and
threw
me
faix
an
is
a
pity
that
you
have
the
one
eye
when
you
know
how
to
make
a
betther
use
of
it
muttered
the
angry
dame
as
she
picked
up
the
pails
and
pushing
him
on
before
her
beat
a
retreat
into
the
bush
i
was
heartily
sick
of
the
long
before
the
season
was
over
however
we
were
well
paid
for
our
trouble
besides
one
hundred
and
twelve
pounds
of
fine
soft
sugar
as
good
as
muscovado
we
had
six
gallons
of
molasses
and
a
keg
containing
six
gallons
of
excellent
vinegar
fifty
pounds
went
to
t
for
the
use
of
his
kettle
and
the
rest
with
the
exception
of
a
cake
for
emilia
which
i
had
drained
in
a
wet
flannel
bag
until
it
was
almost
as
white
as
loaf
sugar
we
kept
for
our
own
use
there
was
no
lack
this
year
of
nice
preserves
and
pickled
cucumbers
dainties
found
in
every
native
canadian
establishment
besides
gaining
a
little
money
with
my
pen
i
practised
a
method
of
painting
birds
and
butterflies
upon
the
white
velvety
surface
of
the
large
fungi
that
grow
plentifully
upon
the
bark
of
the
these
had
an
attractive
appearance
and
my
brother
who
was
a
captain
in
one
of
the
provisional
regiments
sold
a
great
many
of
them
among
the
officers
without
saying
by
whom
they
were
painted
one
rich
lady
in
peterborough
long
since
dead
ordered
two
dozen
to
send
as
curiosities
to
england
these
at
one
shilling
each
enabled
me
to
buy
shoes
for
the
children
who
during
our
bad
times
had
been
forced
to
dispense
with
these
necessary
coverings
how
often
during
the
winter
season
have
i
wept
over
their
little
chapped
feet
literally
washing
them
with
my
tears
but
these
days
were
to
end
providence
was
doing
great
things
for
us
and
hope
raised
at
last
her
drooping
head
to
regard
with
a
brighter
glance
the
future
slowly
the
winter
rolled
away
but
he
to
whom
every
thought
turned
was
still
distant
from
his
humble
home
the
receipt
of
an
occasional
letter
from
him
was
my
only
solace
during
his
long
absence
and
we
were
still
too
poor
to
indulge
often
in
this
luxury
my
poor
katie
was
as
anxious
as
her
mother
to
hear
from
her
father
and
when
i
did
get
the
prize
she
would
kneel
down
before
me
her
little
elbows
resting
on
my
knees
her
head
thrown
back
and
tears
trickling
down
her
innocent
cheeks
eagerly
drinking
in
every
word
the
spring
brought
us
plenty
of
work
we
had
potatoes
and
corn
to
plant
and
the
garden
to
cultivate
by
lending
my
oxen
for
two
work
i
got
wittals
who
had
no
oxen
to
drag
me
in
a
few
acres
of
oats
and
to
prepare
the
land
for
potatoes
and
corn
the
former
i
dropped
into
the
earth
while
jenny
covered
them
up
with
the
hoe
our
garden
was
well
dug
and
plentifully
manured
the
old
woman
bringing
the
manure
which
had
lain
for
several
years
at
the
barn
door
down
to
the
plot
in
a
large
indian
basket
placed
upon
a
we
had
soon
every
sort
of
vegetable
sown
with
plenty
of
melons
and
cucumbers
and
all
our
beds
promised
a
good
return
there
were
large
flights
of
ducks
upon
the
lake
every
night
and
morning
but
though
we
had
guns
we
did
not
know
how
to
use
them
however
i
thought
of
a
plan
which
i
flattered
myself
might
prove
successful
i
got
sol
to
plant
two
stakes
in
the
shallow
water
near
the
rice
beds
and
to
these
i
attached
a
slender
rope
made
by
braiding
long
strips
of
the
inner
bark
of
the
basswood
together
to
these
again
i
fastened
at
regular
intervals
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
of
whipcord
headed
by
a
strong
these
hooks
i
baited
with
fish
offal
leaving
them
to
float
just
under
the
water
early
next
morning
i
saw
a
fine
black
duck
fluttering
upon
the
line
the
boy
ran
down
with
the
paddles
but
before
he
could
reach
the
spot
the
captive
got
away
by
carrying
the
hook
and
line
with
him
at
the
next
stake
he
found
upon
the
hooks
a
large
eel
and
a
i
had
never
before
seen
one
of
those
whiskered
natives
of
the
canadian
waters
so
common
to
the
bay
of
quinte
where
they
grow
to
a
great
size
that
i
was
really
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
hideous
beast
and
told
sol
to
throw
it
away
in
this
i
was
very
foolish
for
they
are
esteemed
good
eating
in
many
parts
of
canada
but
to
me
the
sight
of
the
thing
is
enough
it
is
uglier
and
far
more
than
a
toad
when
the
trees
came
into
leaf
and
the
meadows
were
green
and
flushed
with
flowers
the
poor
children
used
to
talk
constantly
to
me
of
their
father
return
their
innocent
prattle
made
me
very
sad
every
evening
we
walked
into
the
wood
along
the
path
that
he
must
come
whenever
he
did
return
home
to
meet
him
and
though
it
was
a
vain
hope
and
the
walk
was
taken
just
to
amuse
the
little
ones
i
used
to
be
silly
enough
to
feel
deeply
disappointed
when
we
returned
alone
donald
who
was
a
mere
baby
when
his
father
left
us
could
just
begin
to
put
words
together
who
is
papa
when
will
he
come
will
he
come
by
the
road
will
he
come
in
a
canoe
the
little
creature
curiosity
to
see
this
unknown
father
was
really
amusing
and
oh
how
i
longed
to
present
the
little
fellow
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
curling
hair
to
his
father
he
was
so
fair
so
altogether
charming
in
my
eyes
emilia
had
called
him
cedric
the
saxon
and
he
well
suited
the
name
with
his
frank
honest
disposition
and
large
loving
blue
eyes
june
had
commenced
the
weather
was
very
warm
and
t
had
sent
for
the
loan
of
old
jenny
to
help
him
for
a
day
with
his
potatoes
i
had
just
prepared
dinner
when
the
old
woman
came
shrieking
like
a
mad
thing
down
the
clearing
and
waving
her
hands
towards
me
i
could
not
imagine
what
had
happened
ninny
mad
whispered
dunbar
she
the
old
girl
for
making
a
joy
joy
bawled
out
the
old
woman
now
running
breathlessly
toward
us
the
masther
come
the
masther
come
where
where
jist
above
in
the
wood
goodness
gracious
i
have
run
to
let
you
know
so
fast
that
my
heart
is
like
to
without
stopping
to
comfort
poor
jenny
off
started
the
children
and
myself
at
the
very
top
of
our
speed
but
i
soon
found
that
i
could
not
run
i
was
too
much
agitated
i
got
to
the
head
of
the
bush
and
sat
down
upon
a
fallen
tree
the
children
sprang
forward
like
wild
kids
all
but
donald
who
remained
with
his
old
nurse
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
my
heart
too
was
beating
audibly
and
now
that
he
was
come
and
was
so
near
me
i
scarcely
could
command
strength
to
meet
him
the
sound
of
happy
young
voices
roused
me
up
the
children
were
leading
him
along
in
triumph
and
he
was
bending
down
to
them
all
smiles
but
hot
and
tired
with
his
long
journey
it
was
almost
worth
our
separation
that
blissful
meeting
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
at
home
and
the
children
upon
his
knees
katie
stood
silently
holding
his
hand
but
addie
and
dunbar
had
a
thousand
things
to
tell
him
donald
was
frightened
at
his
military
dress
but
he
peeped
at
him
from
behind
my
gown
until
i
caught
and
placed
him
in
his
father
arms
his
leave
of
absence
only
extended
to
a
fortnight
it
had
taken
him
three
days
to
come
all
the
way
from
lake
erie
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
at
point
abino
and
the
same
time
would
be
consumed
in
his
return
he
could
only
remain
with
us
eight
days
how
soon
they
fled
away
how
bitter
was
the
thought
of
parting
with
him
again
he
had
brought
money
to
pay
the
y
y
how
surprised
he
was
to
find
their
large
debt
more
than
half
liquidated
how
gently
did
he
chide
me
for
depriving
myself
and
the
children
of
the
little
comforts
he
had
designed
for
us
in
order
to
make
this
sacrifice
but
never
was
more
fully
rewarded
i
felt
happy
in
having
contributed
in
the
least
to
pay
a
just
debt
to
kind
and
worthy
people
you
must
become
poor
yourself
before
you
can
fully
appreciate
the
good
qualities
of
the
poor
before
you
can
sympathise
with
them
and
fully
recognise
them
as
your
brethren
in
the
flesh
their
benevolence
to
each
other
exercised
amidst
want
and
privation
as
far
surpasses
the
munificence
of
the
rich
towards
them
as
the
exalted
philanthropy
of
christ
and
his
disciples
does
the
christianity
of
the
present
day
the
rich
man
gives
from
his
abundance
the
poor
man
shares
with
a
distressed
comrade
his
all
one
short
happy
week
too
soon
fled
away
and
we
were
once
more
alone
in
the
fall
my
husband
expected
the
regiment
in
which
he
held
his
commission
would
be
reduced
which
would
again
plunge
us
into
the
same
distressing
poverty
often
of
a
night
i
revolved
these
things
in
my
mind
and
perplexed
myself
with
conjectures
as
to
what
in
future
was
to
become
of
us
although
he
had
saved
all
he
could
from
his
pay
it
was
impossible
to
pay
several
hundreds
of
pounds
of
debt
and
the
stock
still
continued
a
dead
letter
to
remain
much
longer
in
the
woods
was
impossible
for
the
returns
from
the
farm
scarcely
fed
us
and
but
for
the
clothing
sent
us
by
friends
from
home
who
were
not
aware
of
our
real
difficulties
we
should
have
been
badly
off
indeed
i
pondered
over
every
plan
that
thought
could
devise
at
last
i
prayed
to
the
almighty
to
direct
me
as
to
what
would
be
the
best
course
for
us
to
pursue
a
sweet
assurance
stole
over
me
and
soothed
my
spirit
that
god
would
provide
for
us
as
he
had
hitherto
done
that
a
great
deal
of
our
distress
arose
from
want
of
faith
i
was
just
sinking
into
a
calm
sleep
when
the
thought
seemed
whispered
into
my
soul
write
to
the
governor
tell
him
candidly
all
you
have
suffered
during
your
sojourn
in
this
country
and
trust
to
god
for
the
at
first
i
paid
little
heed
to
this
suggestion
but
it
became
so
importunate
that
at
last
i
determined
to
act
upon
it
as
if
it
were
a
message
sent
from
heaven
i
rose
from
my
bed
struck
a
light
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
sir
george
arthur
a
simple
statement
of
facts
leaving
it
to
his
benevolence
to
pardon
the
liberty
i
had
taken
in
addressing
him
i
asked
of
him
to
continue
my
husband
in
the
militia
service
in
the
same
regiment
in
which
he
now
held
the
rank
of
captain
which
by
enabling
him
to
pay
our
debts
would
rescue
us
from
our
present
misery
of
the
political
character
of
sir
george
arthur
i
knew
nothing
i
addressed
him
as
a
man
and
a
christian
and
i
acknowledge
with
the
deepest
and
most
heartfelt
gratitude
the
generous
kindness
of
his
conduct
towards
us
before
the
day
dawned
my
letter
was
ready
for
the
post
the
first
secret
i
ever
had
from
my
husband
was
the
writing
of
that
letter
and
proud
and
sensitive
as
he
was
and
averse
to
asking
the
least
favour
of
the
great
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
that
the
act
i
had
just
done
would
be
displeasing
to
him
still
i
felt
resolutely
determined
to
send
it
after
giving
the
children
their
breakfast
i
walked
down
and
read
it
to
my
who
was
not
only
much
pleased
with
its
contents
but
took
it
down
himself
to
the
shortly
after
i
received
a
letter
from
my
husband
informing
me
that
the
regiment
had
been
reduced
and
that
he
should
be
home
in
time
to
get
in
the
harvest
most
anxiously
i
awaited
a
reply
to
my
application
to
the
governor
but
no
reply
came
the
first
week
in
august
our
dear
moodie
came
home
and
brought
with
him
to
our
no
small
joy
e
who
had
just
returned
from
ireland
e
had
been
disappointed
about
the
money
which
was
subject
to
litigation
and
tired
of
waiting
at
home
until
the
tedious
process
of
the
law
should
terminate
he
had
come
back
to
the
woods
and
before
night
was
reinstated
in
his
old
quarters
his
presence
made
jenny
all
alive
she
dared
him
at
once
to
a
trial
of
skill
with
her
in
the
which
e
prudently
declined
he
did
not
expect
to
stay
longer
in
canada
than
the
fall
but
whilst
he
did
stay
he
was
to
consider
our
house
his
home
that
harvest
was
the
happiest
we
ever
spent
in
the
bush
we
had
enough
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
a
spirit
of
peace
and
harmony
pervaded
our
little
dwelling
for
the
most
affectionate
attachment
existed
among
its
members
we
were
not
troubled
with
servants
for
the
good
old
jenny
we
regarded
as
an
humble
friend
and
were
freed
by
that
circumstance
from
many
of
the
cares
and
vexations
of
a
bush
life
our
evening
excursions
on
the
lake
were
doubly
enjoyed
after
the
labours
of
the
day
and
night
brought
us
calm
and
healthful
repose
the
political
struggles
that
convulsed
the
country
were
scarcely
echoed
in
the
depths
of
those
old
primeval
forests
though
the
expulsion
of
mackenzie
from
navy
island
and
the
burning
of
the
caroline
by
captain
drew
had
been
discussed
on
the
farthest
borders
of
civilisation
with
a
tribute
to
the
gallant
conduct
of
that
brave
officer
i
will
close
this
chapter
the
burning
of
the
caroline
a
sound
is
on
the
midnight
deep
the
voice
of
waters
vast
and
onward
with
resistless
sweep
the

rushes
past
in
frantic

what
strange

arise

not

in

to

the

rejoice
hark
on
the
midnight
air
a
frantic
cry
uprose
the
yell
of
fierce
despair
the
shout
of
mortal
foes
and
mark
yon
sudden
glare
whose
red
portentous
gleam
flashes
on
rock
and
stream
with
strange
unearthly
light
what
passing
meteor
beam
lays
bare
the
brow
of

from
yonder
murky

what
demon
vessel
glides
stemming
the
unstemm

where
maddening
breakers
roar
in
hostile

round
her
path
or
hiss
recoiling
from
her
prow

reeling
staggers
to
their
wrath
while
distant

return
the

brightens
from

all

her

fiery
gleam

she
stems
the
raging

and
feels
the

thundering

now
buried

now
whirl
on

struggles
with
her
awful
doom
with
frantic

shudders
the

the

round
her

ring
her
funeral
dirge
the
chafing
billows
round
her
close
but
ere
her
burning

are
riven
shoots
up
one
ruddy
spout
of
fire
her
last
farewell

and
through
the
murky

desolation
marks
the
spirit
of
the
storm
the
of
august
came
and
our
little
harvest
was
all
safely
housed
business
called
moodie
away
for
a
few
days
to
cobourg
jenny
had
gone
to
dummer
to
visit
her
friends
and
e
had
taken
a
grist
of
the
new
wheat
which
he
and
moodie
had
threshed
the
day
before
to
the
mill
i
was
consequently
left
alone
with
the
children
and
had
a
double
portion
of
work
to
do
during
their
absence
it
was
my
lot
to
witness
the
most
awful
storm
i
ever
beheld
and
a
vivid
recollection
of
its
terrors
was
permanently
fixed
upon
my
memory
the
weather
had
been
intensely
hot
during
the
three
preceding
days
although
the
sun
was
entirely
obscured
by
a
blueish
haze
which
seemed
to
render
the
unusual
heat
of
the
atmosphere
more
oppressive
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
vast
forest
and
the
waters
of
the
lake
assumed
a
leaden
hue
after
passing
a
sleepless
night
i
arose
a
little
after
to
superintend
my
domestic
affairs
e
took
his
breakfast
and
went
off
to
the
mill
hoping
that
the
rain
would
keep
off
until
after
his
return
it
is
no
joke
he
said
being
upon
these
lakes
in
a
small
canoe
heavily
laden
in
a
before
the
sun
rose
the
heavens
were
covered
with
clouds
of
a
deep
blue
and
black
cast
fading
away
to
white
at
their
edges
and
in
the
form
resembling
the
long
rolling
waves
of
a
heavy
sea
but
with
this
difference
that
the
clouds
were
perfectly
motionless
piled
in
long
curved
lines
one
above
the
other
and
so
remained
until
four
in
the
afternoon
the
appearance
of
these
clouds
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
horizon
was
the
most
splendid
that
can
be
imagined
tinged
up
to
the
zenith
with
every
shade
of
saffron
gold
scarlet
and
crimson
fading
away
into
the
deepest
violet
never
did
the
shake
in
the
face
of
a
day
a
more
gorgeous
banner
and
pressed
as
i
was
for
time
i
stood
gazing
like
one
entranced
upon
the
magnificent
pageant
as
the
day
advanced
the
same
blue
haze
obscured
the
sun
which
frowned
redly
through
his
misty
veil
at
ten
the
heat
was
suffocating
and
i
extinguished
the
fire
in
the
determined
to
make
our
meals
upon
bread
and
milk
rather
than
add
to
the
oppressive
heat
the
thermometer
in
the
shade
ranged
from
to
degrees
and
i
gave
over
my
work
and
retired
with
the
little
ones
to
the
coolest
part
of
the
house
the
young
creatures
stretched
themselves
upon
the
floor
unable
to
jump
about
or
play
the
dog
lay
panting
in
the
shade
the
fowls
themselves
in
the
dust
with
open
beaks
and
outstretched
wings
all
nature
seemed
to
droop
beneath
the
scorching
heat
unfortunately
for
me
a
gentlemen
arrived
about
one
from
kingston
to
transact
some
business
with
my
husband
he
had
not
tasted
food
since
six
and
i
was
obliged
to
kindle
the
fire
to
prepare
his
dinner
it
was
one
of
the
hardest
tasks
i
ever
performed
i
almost
fainted
with
the
heat
and
most
inhospitably
rejoiced
when
his
dinner
was
over
and
i
saw
him
depart
shortly
after
my
friend
c
and
her
brother
called
in
on
their
way
from
peterborough
how
do
you
bear
the
heat
asked
c
this
is
one
of
the
hottest
days
i
ever
remember
to
have
experienced
in
this
part
of
the
province
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
end
in
a
hurricane
or
what
the
lower
canadians
term
about
four
they
rose
to
go
i
urged
them
to
stay
longer
no
said
c
the
sooner
we
get
home
the
better
i
think
we
can
reach
it
before
the
storm
i
took
donald
in
my
arms
and
my
eldest
boy
by
the
hand
and
walked
with
them
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
thinking
that
the
air
would
be
cooler
in
the
shade
in
this
i
was
mistaken
the
clouds
over
our
heads
hung
so
low
and
the
heat
was
so
great
that
i
was
soon
glad
to
retrace
my
steps
the
moment
i
turned
round
to
face
the
lake
i
was
surprised
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
the
appearance
of
the
heavens
the
clouds
that
had
before
lain
so
motionless
were
now
in
rapid
motion
hurrying
and
chasing
each
other
round
the
horizon
it
was
a
strangely
awful
sight
before
i
felt
a
breath
of
the
mighty
blast
that
had
already
burst
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
branches
of
trees
leaves
and
clouds
of
dust
were
whirled
across
the
lake
whose
waters
rose
in
long
sharp
furrows
fringed
with
foam
as
if
moved
in
their
depths
by
some
unseen
but
powerful
agent
panting
with
terror
i
just
reached
the
door
of
the
house
as
the
hurricane
swept
up
the
hill
crushing
and
overturning
everything
in
its
course
i
stood
at
the
open
door
with
clasped
hands
unable
to
speak
rendered
dumb
and
motionless
by
the
terrible
grandeur
of
the
scene
while
little
donald
who
could
not
utter
many
intelligible
words
crept
to
my
feet
appealing
to
me
for
protection
while
his
rosy
cheeks
paled
even
to
marble
whiteness
the
hurrying
clouds
gave
to
the
heavens
the
appearance
of
a
pointed
dome
round
which
the
lightning
played
in
broad
ribbons
of
fire
the
roaring
of
the
thunder
the
rushing
of
the
blast
the
impetuous
of
the
rain
and
the
crash
of
falling
trees
were
perfectly
deafening
and
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
of
the
elements
old
jenny
burst
in
drenched
with
wet
and
with
fear
the
lord
preserve
us
she
cried
this
surely
is
the
day
of
judgment
fifty
trees
fell
across
my
very
path
between
this
an
the
creek
c
just
reached
her
brother
clearing
a
few
minutes
before
a
great
oak
fell
on
her
very
path
what
thunther
what
lightning
misthress
dear
it
turn
so
dark
i
can
only
jist
see
yer
glad
enough
was
i
of
her
presence
for
to
be
alone
in
the
heart
of
a
great
forest
in
a
log
hut
on
such
a
night
was
not
a
pleasing
prospect
people
gain
courage
by
companionship
and
in
order
to
each
other
struggle
to
conceal
their
fears
and
where
is
e
i
hope
not
on
the
lake
he
went
early
this
morning
to
get
the
wheat
ground
at
the
och
the
crathur
he
surely
drowned
what
boat
could
stan
such
a
scrimmage
as
this
i
had
my
fears
for
poor
john
but
as
the
chance
that
he
had
to
wait
at
the
mill
till
others
were
served
was
more
than
probable
i
tried
to
still
my
apprehensions
for
his
safety
the
storm
soon
passed
over
after
having
levelled
several
acres
of
wood
near
the
house
and
smitten
down
in
its
progress
two
gigantic
pines
in
the
clearing
which
must
have
withstood
the
force
of
a
thousand
winters
talking
over
the
effects
of
this
whirlwind
with
my
brother
he
kindly
sent
me
the
following
very
graphic
description
of
a
whirlwind
which
passed
the
town
of
guelph
in
the
summer
of
written
by
strickland
of
douro
in
my
hunting
excursions
and
rambles
through
the
upper
canadian
forests
i
had
frequently
met
with
extensive
and
observed
with
some
surprise
that
the
fallen
trees
lay
strewn
in
a
succession
of
circles
and
evidently
appeared
to
have
been
twisted
off
the
stumps
i
also
remarked
that
these
were
generally
narrow
and
had
the
appearance
of
a
road
slashed
through
the
forest
from
observations
made
at
the
time
and
since
confirmed
i
have
no
doubt
that
colonel
reid
theory
of
storms
is
the
correct
one
that
all
move
in
a
circular
direction
and
the
nearer
the
centre
the
more
violent
the
force
of
the
wind
having
seen
the
effects
of
several
similar
hurricanes
since
my
residence
in
canada
west
i
shall
proceed
to
describe
one
which
happened
in
the
township
of
guelph
during
the
early
part
of
the
summer
of
the
weather
for
the
season
of
the
year
may
had
been
hot
and
sultry
with
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
i
had
heard
distant
thunder
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
which
from
the
eastward
is
rather
an
unusual
occurrence
about
the
sky
had
a
most
singular
and
i
must
add
a
most
awful
appearance
presenting
to
the
view
a
vast
arch
of
rolling
blackness
which
seemed
to
gather
strength
and
density
as
it
approached
the
zenith
all
at
once
the
clouds
began
to
work
round
in
circles
as
if
chasing
one
another
through
the
air
suddenly
the
dark
arch
of
clouds
appeared
to
break
up
into
detached
masses
whirling
and
mixing
through
each
other
in
dreadful
commotion
the
forked
lightning
was
incessant
accompanied
by
heavy
thunder
in
a
short
time
the
clouds
seemed
to
converge
to
a
point
which
approached
very
near
the
earth
still
whirling
with
great
rapidity
directly
under
this
point
and
apparently
from
the
midst
of
the
woods
arose
a
black
column
in
the
shape
of
a
cone
which
instantly
joined
itself
to
the
depending
cloud
the
sight
was
now
grand
and
awful
in
the
extreme
picture
to
your
imagination
a
vast
column
of
smoke
of
inky
blackness
reaching
from
the
earth
to
heaven
gyrating
with
fearful
velocity
bright
lightnings
issuing
from
the
vortex
the
roar
of
the
thunder
the
rushing
of
the
blast
the
crash
of
timber
the
limbs
of
trees
leaves
and
rubbish
mingled
with
clouds
of
dust
whirling
through
the
air
you
then
have
a
faint
idea
of
the
scene
i
had
ample
time
for
observation
as
the
hurricane
commenced
its
devastating
course
about
two
miles
from
the
town
through
the
centre
of
which
it
took
its
way
passing
within
fifty
yards
of
where
a
number
of
persons
myself
among
the
rest
were
standing
watching
its
fearful
progress
as
the
tornado
approached
the
trees
seemed
to
fall
like
a
pack
of
cards
before
its
irresistible
current
after
passing
through
the
clearing
made
around
the
village
the
force
of
the
wind
gradually
abated
and
in
a
few
minutes
died
away
entirely
as
soon
as
the
storm
was
over
i
went
to
see
the
damage
it
had
done
from
the
point
where
i
first
observed
the
black
column
to
rise
from
the
woods
and
join
the
cloud
the
trees
were
twisted
in
every
direction
a
belt
of
timber
had
been
levelled
to
the
ground
about
two
miles
in
length
and
about
one
hundred
yards
in
breadth
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
it
crossed
the
river
speed
and
uprooted
about
six
acres
of
wood
which
had
been
thinned
out
and
left
by
galt
late
superintendent
of
the
canada
company
as
an
ornament
to
his
house
the
eremosa
road
was
completely
blocked
up
for
nearly
in
the
wildest
confusion
possible
in
its
progress
through
the
town
the
storm
unroofed
several
houses
levelled
many
fences
to
the
ground
and
entirely
demolished
a
frame
barn
windows
were
dashed
in
and
in
one
instance
the
floor
of
a
log
house
was
carried
through
the
roof
some
escapes
occurred
but
luckily
no
lives
were
lost
about
twelve
years
since
a
similar
storm
occurred
in
the
north
part
of
the
township
of
douro
but
was
of
much
less
magnitude
i
heard
an
intelligent
settler
who
resided
some
years
in
the
township
of
madoc
state
that
during
his
residence
in
that
township
a
similar
hurricane
to
the
one
i
have
described
though
of
a
much
more
awful
character
passed
through
a
part
of
marmora
and
madoc
and
had
been
traced
in
a
direction
upwards
of
forty
miles
into
the
unsurveyed
lands
the
uniform
width
of
which
appeared
to
be
three
quarters
of
a
mile
it
is
very
evident
from
the
traces
which
they
have
left
behind
them
that
storms
of
this
description
have
not
been
unfrequent
in
the
wooded
districts
of
canada
and
it
becomes
a
matter
of
interesting
consideration
whether
the
clearing
of
our
immense
forests
will
not
in
a
great
measure
remove
the
cause
of
these
a
few
minutes
after
our
household
had
retired
to
rest
my
first
sleep
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
e
speaking
to
old
jenny
in
the
kitchen
he
had
been
overtaken
by
the
storm
but
had
run
his
canoe
ashore
upon
an
island
before
its
full
fury
burst
and
turned
it
over
the
flour
while
he
had
to
brave
the
terrors
of
the
pitiless
tempest
buffeted
by
the
wind
and
drenched
with
torrents
of
rain
i
got
up
and
made
him
a
cup
of
tea
while
jenny
prepared
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
eggs
for
his
supper
shortly
after
this
e
bade
a
final
adieu
to
canada
with
his
cousin
w
he
volunteered
into
the
scotch
greys
and
we
never
saw
him
more
but
i
have
been
told
that
he
was
so
highly
respected
by
the
officers
of
the
regiment
that
they
have
subscribed
for
his
commission
that
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
accompanied
the
regiment
to
india
and
was
at
the
taking
of
cabul
but
from
himself
we
never
heard
again
the
of
october
my
third
son
was
born
and
a
few
days
after
my
husband
was
appointed
to
the
militia
regiments
in
the
district
with
the
rank
and
full
pay
of
captain
this
was
sir
george
arthur
doing
he
returned
no
answer
to
my
application
but
he
did
not
forget
us
as
the
time
that
moodie
might
retain
this
situation
was
very
doubtful
he
thought
it
advisable
not
to
remove
me
and
the
family
until
he
could
secure
some
permanent
situation
by
so
doing
he
would
have
a
better
opportunity
of
saving
the
greater
part
of
his
income
to
pay
off
his
old
debts
this
winter
of
was
one
of
severe
trial
to
me
hitherto
i
had
enjoyed
the
blessing
of
health
but
both
the
children
and
myself
were
now
doomed
to
suffer
from
dangerous
attacks
of
illness
all
the
little
things
had
malignant
scarlet
fever
and
for
several
days
i
thought
it
would
please
the
almighty
to
take
from
me
my
two
girls
this
fever
is
so
fatal
to
children
in
canada
that
none
of
my
neighbors
dared
approach
the
house
for
three
weeks
jenny
and
i
were
never
undressed
our
whole
time
was
taken
up
nursing
the
five
little
helpless
creatures
through
the
successive
states
of
their
alarming
disease
i
sent
for
taylor
but
he
did
not
come
and
i
was
obliged
to
trust
to
the
mercy
of
god
and
my
own
judgment
and
good
nursing
though
i
escaped
the
fever
mental
anxiety
and
fatigue
brought
on
other
illness
which
for
nearly
ten
weeks
rendered
me
perfectly
helpless
when
i
was
again
able
to
creep
from
my
sick
bed
the
baby
was
seized
with
an
illness
which
b
pronounced
mortal
against
all
hope
he
recovered
but
these
severe
mental
trials
rendered
me
weak
and
nervous
and
more
anxious
than
ever
to
be
to
my
husband
to
add
to
these
troubles
my
sister
and
her
husband
sold
their
farm
and
removed
from
our
neighbourhood
had
returned
to
england
and
had
obtained
a
situation
in
the
customs
and
his
wife
my
friend
emilia
was
keeping
a
school
in
the
village
so
that
i
felt
more
solitary
than
ever
thus
deprived
of
so
many
kind
sympathising
friends
a
song
of
praise
to
the
creator
oh
thou

whose
eternal

unbounded
blessings
in

along
her
road
how
can
thy
creatures
their
weak
voices
raise
to
tell
thy
deeds
in
their
faint
songs
of
praise
when
darkling
the
mountain

hoar
portentous

the

chapter

the
walk
to
dummer
we
trod
a
weary
path
through
silent
woods
tangled
and
dark
unbroken
by
a
sound
of
cheerful
life
the
melancholy
shriek
of
hollow
winds
careering
the
snow
or
tossing
into
waves
the
green
pine
tops
making
the
ancient
forest
groan
and
sigh
beneath
their
mocking
voice
awoke
alone
the
solitary
echoes
of
the
place
reader
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
place
situated
in
the
of
this
far
western
wilderness
called
dummer
ten
years
ago
it
might
not
inaptly
have
been
termed
the
last
clearing
in
the
nor
to
this
day
do
i
know
of
any
in
that
direction
which
extends
beyond
it
our
was
situated
on
the
of
a
neighbouring
township
only
one
degree
less
wild
less
out
of
the
world
or
nearer
to
the
habitations
of
civilisation
than
the
english
line
the
boast
and
glory
of
this
terra
incognita
this
place
so
named
by
the
emigrants
who
had
pitched
their
tents
in
that
solitary
wilderness
was
a
long
line
of
cleared
land
extending
upon
either
side
for
some
miles
through
the
darkest
and
most
interminable
forest
the
english
line
was
inhabited
chiefly
by
cornish
miners
who
tired
of
burrowing
like
moles
underground
had
determined
to
emigrate
to
canada
where
they
could
breathe
the
fresh
air
of
heaven
and
obtain
the
necessaries
of
life
upon
the
bosom
of
their
mother
earth
strange
as
it
may
appear
these
men
made
good
farmers
and
steady
industrious
colonists
working
as
well
above
ground
as
they
had
toiled
in
their
early
days
beneath
it
all
our
best
servants
came
from
dummer
and
although
they
spoke
a
language
difficult
to
be
understood
and
were
uncouth
in
their
manners
and
appearance
they
were
faithful
and
obedient
performing
the
tasks
assigned
to
them
with
patient
perseverance
good
food
and
kind
treatment
rendering
them
always
cheerful
and
contented
my
dear
old
jenny
that
most
faithful
and
attached
of
all
humble
domestic
friends
came
from
dummer
and
i
was
wont
to
regard
it
with
complacency
for
her
sake
but
jenny
was
not
english
she
was
a
generous
daughter
of
the
green
isle
the
emerald
gem
set
in
the
silver
of
ocean
yes
jenny
was
one
of
the
poorest
children
of
that
impoverished
but
glorious
country
where
wit
and
talent
seem
indigenous
springing
up
spontaneously
in
the
rudest
and
most
uncultivated
minds
showing
what
the
land
could
bring
forth
in
its
own
strength
unaided
by
education
and
unfettered
by
the
conventional
rules
of
society
jenny
was
a
striking
instance
of
the
worth
noble
and
devotion
which
are
often
met
withand
alas
but
too
often
disregarded
in
the
poor
and
ignorant
natives
of
that
and
much
abused
land
a
few
words
about
my
old
favourite
may
not
prove
uninteresting
to
my
readers
jenny
buchanan
or
as
she
called
it
bohanon
was
the
daughter
of
a
petty
exciseman
of
scotch
extraction
hence
her
industry
who
at
the
time
of
her
birth
resided
near
the
old
town
of
inniskillen
her
mother
died
a
few
months
after
she
was
born
and
her
father
within
the
twelve
months
married
again
in
the
meanwhile
the
poor
orphan
babe
had
been
adopted
by
a
kind
neighbour
the
wife
of
a
small
farmer
in
the
vicinity
in
return
for
coarse
food
and
scanty
clothing
the
little
jenny
became
a
she
fed
the
pigs
herded
the
cattle
assisted
in
planting
potatoes
and
digging
peat
from
the
bog
and
was
undisputed
mistress
of
the
as
she
grew
up
to
womanhood
the
importance
of
her
labours
increased
a
better
reaper
in
the
or
footer
of
turf
in
the
bog
could
not
be
found
in
the
district
or
a
woman
more
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
management
of
cows
and
the
rearing
of
young
cattle
but
here
poor
jenny
accomplishments
terminated
her
usefulness
was
all
abroad
within
the
house
she
made
more
dirt
than
she
had
the
inclination
or
the
ability
to
clear
away
she
could
neither
read
nor
knit
nor
sew
and
although
she
called
herself
a
protestant
and
a
church
of
england
woman
she
knew
no
more
of
religion
as
revealed
to
man
through
the
word
of
god
than
the
savage
who
sinks
to
the
grave
in
ignorance
of
a
redeemer
hence
she
stoutly
resisted
all
ideas
of
being
a
sinner
or
of
standing
the
least
chance
of
receiving
hereafter
the
condemnation
of
one
och
sure
thin
she
would
say
with
simple
earnestness
of
look
and
manner
almost
irresistible
god
will
never
throuble
himsel
about
a
poor
crathur
like
me
who
never
did
any
harm
to
the
manest
of
his
one
thing
was
certain
that
a
benevolent
providence
had
throubled
himsel
about
poor
jenny
in
times
past
for
the
warm
heart
of
this
neglected
child
of
nature
contained
a
stream
of
the
richest
benevolence
which
situated
as
she
had
been
could
not
have
been
derived
from
any
other
source
honest
faithful
and
industrious
jenny
became
a
law
unto
herself
and
practically
illustrated
the
golden
rule
of
her
blessed
lord
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
they
should
do
unto
she
thought
it
was
impossible
that
her
poor
services
could
ever
repay
the
debt
of
gratitude
that
she
owed
to
the
family
who
had
brought
her
up
although
the
obligation
must
have
been
entirely
on
their
side
to
them
she
was
greatly
attached
for
them
she
toiled
unceasingly
and
when
evil
days
came
and
they
were
not
able
to
meet
the
or
to
occupy
the
farm
she
determined
to
accompany
them
in
their
emigration
to
canada
and
formed
one
of
the
band
that
fixed
its
location
in
the
lonely
and
unexplored
wilds
now
known
as
the
township
of
dummer
during
the
first
year
of
their
settlement
the
means
of
obtaining
the
common
necessaries
of
life
became
so
precarious
that
in
order
to
assist
her
friends
with
a
little
ready
money
jenny
determined
to
hire
out
into
some
wealthy
house
as
a
servant
when
i
use
the
term
wealth
as
applied
to
any
it
is
of
course
only
comparatively
but
jenny
was
anxious
to
obtain
a
place
with
settlers
who
enjoyed
a
small
income
independent
of
their
forest
means
her
first
speculation
was
a
complete
failure
for
five
long
hopeless
years
she
served
a
master
from
whom
she
never
received
a
farthing
of
her
stipulated
wages
still
her
attachment
to
the
family
was
so
strong
and
had
become
so
much
the
necessity
of
her
life
that
the
poor
creature
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
them
the
children
whom
she
had
received
into
her
arms
at
their
birth
and
whom
she
had
nursed
with
maternal
tenderness
were
as
dear
to
her
as
if
they
had
been
her
own
she
continued
to
work
for
them
although
her
clothes
were
worn
to
tatters
and
her
own
friends
were
too
poor
to
replace
them
her
master
captain
n
a
handsome
dashing
officer
who
had
served
many
years
in
india
still
maintained
the
carriage
and
appearance
of
a
gentleman
in
spite
of
his
mental
and
moral
degradation
arising
from
a
constant
state
of
intoxication
he
still
promised
to
remunerate
at
some
future
day
her
faithful
services
and
although
all
his
neighbours
well
knew
that
his
means
were
exhausted
and
that
that
day
would
never
come
yet
jenny
in
the
simplicity
of
her
faith
still
toiled
on
in
the
hope
that
the
better
day
he
spoke
of
would
soon
arrive
and
now
a
few
words
respecting
this
master
which
i
trust
may
serve
as
a
warning
to
others
allured
by
the
bait
that
has
been
the
ruin
of
so
many
of
his
class
the
offer
of
a
large
grant
of
land
captain
n
had
been
induced
to
form
a
settlement
in
this
remote
and
untried
township
laying
out
much
if
not
all
of
his
available
means
in
building
a
log
house
and
clearing
a
large
extent
of
barren
and
stony
land
to
this
uninviting
home
he
conveyed
a
beautiful
young
wife
and
a
small
and
increasing
family
the
result
may
be
easily
anticipated
the
want
of
society
a
dreadful
want
to
a
man
of
his
previous
habits
the
absence
of
all
the
comforts
and
decencies
of
life
produced
inaction
apathy
and
at
last
despondency
which
was
only
alleviated
by
a
constant
and
immoderate
use
of
ardent
spirits
as
long
as
captain
n
retained
his
he
contrived
to
exist
in
an
evil
hour
he
parted
with
this
and
quickly
trod
the
downhill
path
to
ruin
and
here
i
would
remark
that
it
is
always
a
rash
and
hazardous
step
for
any
officer
to
part
with
his
although
it
is
almost
every
day
done
and
generally
followed
by
the
same
disastrous
results
a
certain
income
however
small
in
a
country
where
money
is
so
hard
to
be
procured
and
where
labour
can
not
be
obtained
but
at
a
very
high
pecuniary
remuneration
is
invaluable
to
a
gentleman
unaccustomed
to
agricultural
employment
who
without
this
reserve
to
pay
his
people
during
the
brief
but
expensive
seasons
of
and
harvest
must
either
work
himself
or
starve
i
have
known
no
instance
in
which
such
sale
has
been
attended
with
ultimate
advantage
but
alas
too
many
in
which
it
has
terminated
in
the
most
distressing
destitution
these
government
grants
of
land
to
officers
have
induced
numbers
of
this
class
to
emigrate
to
the
backwoods
of
canada
who
are
totally
unfit
for
pioneers
but
tempted
by
the
offer
of
finding
themselves
landholders
of
what
on
paper
appear
to
them
fine
estates
they
resign
a
certainty
to
waste
their
energies
and
die
and
in
the
depths
of
the
pitiless
wild
if
a
gentleman
so
situated
would
give
up
all
idea
of
settling
on
his
grant
but
hire
a
good
farm
in
a
favourable
situation
that
is
not
too
far
from
a
market
and
with
his
hire
efficient
labourers
of
which
plenty
are
now
to
be
had
to
cultivate
the
land
with
common
prudence
and
economy
he
would
soon
obtain
a
comfortable
subsistence
for
his
family
and
if
the
males
were
brought
up
to
share
the
burthen
and
heat
of
the
day
the
expense
of
hired
labour
as
it
yearly
diminished
would
add
to
the
general
means
and
of
the
whole
until
the
hired
farm
became
the
real
property
of
the
industrious
tenants
but
the
love
of
show
the
vain
boast
of
appearing
richer
and
than
our
neighbours
too
often
involves
the
emigrant
family
in
debt
from
which
they
are
seldom
able
to
extricate
themselves
without
sacrificing
the
means
which
would
have
secured
their
independence
this
although
a
long
digression
will
not
i
hope
be
without
its
use
and
if
this
book
is
regarded
not
as
a
work
of
amusement
but
one
of
practical
experience
written
for
the
benefit
of
others
it
will
not
fail
to
convey
some
useful
hints
to
those
who
have
contemplated
emigration
to
canada
the
best
country
in
the
world
for
the
industrious
and
man
who
really
comes
out
to
work
and
to
better
his
condition
by
the
labour
of
his
hands
but
a
gulf
of
ruin
to
the
vain
and
idle
who
only
set
foot
upon
these
shores
to
accelerate
their
ruin
but
to
return
to
captain
n
it
was
at
this
disastrous
period
that
jenny
entered
his
service
had
her
master
adapted
his
habits
and
expenditure
to
his
altered
circumstances
much
misery
might
have
been
spared
both
to
himself
and
his
family
but
he
was
a
proud
man
too
proud
to
work
or
to
receive
with
kindness
the
offers
of
service
tendered
to
him
by
his
but
neighbours
hang
him
cried
an
indignant
english
settler
captain
n
was
an
irishman
whose
offer
of
drawing
wood
had
been
rejected
with
unmerited
contempt
wait
a
few
years
and
we
shall
see
what
his
pride
will
do
for
him
i
sorry
for
his
poor
wife
and
children
but
for
himself
i
have
no
pity
for
this
man
had
been
uselessly
insulted
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
anxious
to
perform
a
kind
and
benevolent
action
when
like
a
true
englishman
his
heart
was
softened
by
witnessing
the
sufferings
of
a
young
delicate
female
and
her
infant
family
deeply
affronted
by
the
captain
foolish
conduct
he
now
took
a
malignant
pleasure
in
watching
his
arrogant
neighbour
progress
to
ruin
the
year
after
the
sale
of
his
commission
captain
n
found
himself
considerably
in
debt
never
mind
ella
he
said
to
his
anxious
wife
the
crops
will
pay
the
crops
were
a
failure
that
year
creditors
pressed
hard
the
captain
had
no
money
to
pay
his
workmen
and
he
would
not
work
himself
disgusted
with
his
location
but
unable
to
change
it
for
a
better
without
friends
in
his
own
class
for
he
was
the
only
gentleman
then
resident
in
the
new
township
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
his
existence
with
their
society
or
to
afford
him
advice
or
assistance
in
his
difficulties
the
fatal
became
his
refuge
from
gloomy
thoughts
his
wife
an
amiable
and
devoted
creature
and
deserving
of
a
better
lot
did
all
in
her
power
to
wean
him
from
the
growing
vice
but
alas
the
pleadings
of
an
angel
in
such
circumstances
would
have
had
little
effect
upon
the
mind
of
such
a
man
he
loved
her
as
well
as
he
could
love
anything
and
he
fancied
that
he
loved
his
children
while
he
was
daily
reducing
them
by
his
favourite
vice
to
beggary
for
awhile
he
confined
his
excesses
to
his
own
fireside
but
this
was
only
for
as
long
a
period
as
the
sale
of
his
stock
and
land
would
supply
him
with
the
means
of
criminal
indulgence
after
a
time
all
these
resources
failed
and
his
large
grant
of
eight
hundred
acres
of
land
had
been
converted
into
whiskey
except
the
one
hundred
acres
on
which
his
house
and
barn
stood
embracing
the
small
clearing
from
which
the
family
derived
their
scanty
supply
of
wheat
and
potatoes
for
the
sake
of
peace
his
wife
gave
up
all
her
ornaments
and
household
plate
and
the
best
articles
of
a
once
handsome
and
ample
wardrobe
in
the
hope
of
hiding
her
sorrows
from
the
world
and
keeping
her
husband
at
home
the
pride
that
had
rendered
him
so
obnoxious
to
his
humbler
neighbours
yielded
at
length
to
the
inordinate
craving
for
drink
the
man
who
had
held
himself
so
high
above
his
honest
and
industrious
could
now
unblushingly
enter
their
cabins
and
beg
for
a
drop
of
whiskey
the
feeling
of
shame
once
subdued
there
was
no
end
to
his
audacious
mendacity
his
whole
time
was
spent
in
wandering
about
the
country
calling
upon
every
new
settler
in
the
hope
of
being
asked
to
partake
of
the
coveted
poison
he
was
even
known
to
enter
by
the
window
of
an
cabin
during
the
absence
of
the
owner
and
remain
drinking
in
the
house
while
a
drop
of
spirits
could
be
found
in
the
cupboard
when
driven
forth
by
the
angry
owner
of
the
hut
he
wandered
on
to
the
distant
town
of
p
and
lived
there
in
a
low
tavern
while
his
wife
and
children
were
starving
at
home
he
is
the
filthiest
beast
in
the
township
said
the
neighbour
to
me
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
his
wife
and
children
if
his
worthless
neck
were
broken
in
one
of
his
drunken
this
might
be
the
melancholy
fact
but
it
was
not
the
less
dreadful
on
that
account
the
husband
of
an
affectionate
wife
the
father
of
a
lovely
family
and
his
death
to
be
a
matter
of
rejoicing
a
blessing
instead
of
being
an
affliction
an
agony
not
to
be
thought
upon
without
the
deepest
sorrow
it
was
at
this
melancholy
period
of
her
sad
history
that
n
found
in
jenny
buchanan
a
help
in
her
hour
of
need
the
heart
of
the
faithful
creature
bled
for
the
misery
which
involved
the
wife
of
her
degraded
master
and
the
children
she
so
dearly
loved
their
want
and
destitution
called
all
the
sympathies
of
her
ardent
nature
into
active
operation
they
were
long
indebted
to
her
labour
for
every
morsel
of
food
which
they
consumed
for
them
she
sowed
she
planted
she
reaped
every
block
of
wood
which
shed
a
cheering
warmth
around
their
desolate
home
was
cut
from
the
forest
by
her
own
hands
and
brought
up
a
steep
hill
to
the
house
upon
her
back
for
them
she
coaxed
the
neighbours
with
whom
she
was
a
general
favourite
out
of
many
a
mess
of
eggs
for
their
especial
benefit
while
with
her
cheerful
songs
and
hearty
hopeful
disposition
she
dispelled
much
of
the
cramping
despair
which
chilled
the
heart
of
the
unhappy
mother
in
her
deserted
home
for
several
years
did
this
great
poor
woman
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
of
her
beloved
mistress
toiling
for
her
with
the
strength
and
energy
of
a
man
when
was
man
ever
so
devoted
so
devoid
of
all
selfishness
so
attached
to
employers
yet
poorer
than
herself
as
this
uneducated
irishwoman
a
period
was
at
length
put
to
her
unrequited
services
in
a
fit
of
intoxication
her
master
beat
her
severely
with
the
iron
ramrod
of
his
gun
and
turned
her
with
abusive
language
from
his
doors
oh
hard
return
for
all
her
unpaid
labours
of
love
she
forgave
this
outrage
for
the
sake
of
the
helpless
beings
who
depended
upon
her
care
he
repeated
the
injury
and
the
poor
creature
returned
almost
to
her
former
home
thinking
that
his
spite
would
subside
in
a
few
days
jenny
made
a
third
effort
to
enter
his
house
in
her
usual
capacity
but
n
told
her
with
many
tears
that
her
presence
would
only
enrage
her
husband
who
had
threatened
herself
with
the
most
cruel
treatment
if
she
allowed
the
faithful
servant
again
to
enter
the
house
thus
ended
her
five
years
service
to
this
ungrateful
master
such
was
her
reward
i
heard
of
jenny
worth
and
kindness
from
the
englishman
who
had
been
so
grievously
affronted
by
captain
n
and
sent
for
her
to
come
to
me
she
instantly
accepted
my
offer
and
returned
with
my
messenger
she
had
scarcely
a
garment
to
cover
her
i
was
obliged
to
find
her
a
suit
of
clothes
before
i
could
set
her
to
work
the
smiles
and
dimples
of
my
rosy
little
donald
then
a
of
fifteen
months
consoled
the
old
woman
for
her
separation
from
ellie
n
and
the
with
which
all
the
children
now
four
in
number
regarded
the
kind
old
body
soon
endeared
to
her
the
new
home
which
providence
had
assigned
to
her
her
accounts
of
n
and
her
family
soon
deeply
interested
me
in
her
fate
and
jenny
never
went
to
visit
her
friends
in
dummer
without
an
interchange
of
good
wishes
passing
between
us
the
year
of
the
canadian
rebellion
came
and
brought
with
it
sorrow
into
many
a
bush
dwelling
old
jenny
and
i
were
left
alone
with
the
little
children
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
forest
to
help
ourselves
in
the
best
way
we
could
men
could
not
be
procured
in
that
spot
for
love
nor
money
and
i
now
fully
realised
the
extent
of
jenny
usefulness
daily
she
yoked
the
oxen
and
brought
down
from
the
bush
fuel
to
maintain
our
fires
which
she
felled
and
chopped
up
with
her
own
hands
she
fed
the
cattle
and
kept
all
things
snug
about
the
doors
not
forgetting
to
load
her
master
two
guns
in
case
as
she
said
the
ribels
should
attack
us
in
our
the
months
of
november
and
december
of
had
been
unnaturally
mild
for
this
iron
climate
but
the
opening
of
the
ensuing
january
brought
a
short
but
severe
spell
of
frost
and
snow
we
felt
very
lonely
in
our
solitary
dwelling
crouching
round
the
blazing
fire
that
scarcely
chased
the
cold
from
our
miserable
until
this
dreary
period
was
suddenly
cheered
by
the
unexpected
presence
of
my
beloved
friend
emilia
who
came
to
spend
a
week
with
me
in
my
forest
home
she
brought
her
own
with
her
and
an
ample
supply
of
buffalo
robes
not
forgetting
a
treat
of
baker
bread
and
sweeties
for
the
children
oh
dear
emilia
best
and
kindest
of
women
though
absent
in
your
native
land
long
long
shall
my
heart
cherish
with
affectionate
gratitude
all
your
visits
of
love
and
turn
to
you
as
to
a
sister
tried
and
found
most
faithful
in
the
dark
hour
of
adversity
and
amidst
the
almost
total
neglect
of
those
from
whom
nature
claimed
a
tenderer
and
holier
sympathy
great
was
the
joy
of
jenny
at
this
accession
to
our
family
party
and
after
s
was
well
warmed
and
had
partaken
of
tea
the
only
refreshment
we
could
offer
her
we
began
to
talk
over
the
news
of
the
place
jenny
said
she
turning
to
the
old
servant
who
was
undressing
the
little
boy
by
the
fire
have
you
heard
lately
from
poor
n
we
have
been
told
that
she
and
the
family
are
in
a
dreadful
state
of
destitution
that
worthless
man
has
left
them
for
the
states
and
it
is
supposed
that
he
has
joined
mackenzie
band
of
ruffians
on
navy
island
but
whether
this
be
true
or
false
he
has
deserted
his
wife
and
children
taking
his
eldest
son
along
with
him
who
might
have
been
of
some
service
at
home
and
leaving
them
without
money
or
the
good
lord
what
will
become
of
the
crathurs
responded
jenny
wiping
her
wrinkled
cheek
with
the
back
of
her
hard
brown
hand
an
thin
they
have
not
a
sowl
to
chop
and
draw
them
firewood
the
weather
so
oncommon
savare
och
hone
what
has
not
that
of
a
man
to
answer
for
i
heard
continued
s
that
they
have
tasted
no
food
but
potatoes
for
the
last
nine
months
and
scarcely
enough
of
them
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
that
they
have
sold
their
last
cow
and
the
poor
young
lady
and
her
second
brother
a
lad
of
only
twelve
years
old
bring
all
the
wood
for
the
fire
from
the
bush
on
a
hand
oh
dear
oh
dear
sobbed
jenny
an
i
not
there
to
hilp
them
an
poor
miss
mary
the
tinder
thing
oh
is
hard
terribly
hard
upon
the
crathurs
an
they
not
used
to
the
can
nothing
be
done
for
them
said
i
that
is
what
we
want
to
know
returned
emilia
and
that
was
one
of
my
reasons
for
coming
up
to
d
i
wanted
to
consult
you
and
jenny
upon
the
subject
you
who
are
an
officer
wife
and
i
who
am
both
an
officer
wife
and
daughter
ought
to
devise
some
plan
of
rescuing
this
poor
unfortunate
lady
and
her
family
from
her
present
forlorn
the
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
and
i
thought
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
upon
my
own
galling
poverty
that
my
pockets
did
not
contain
even
a
single
copper
and
that
i
had
scarcely
garments
enough
to
shield
me
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
by
unflinching
industry
and
taking
my
part
in
the
toil
of
the
field
i
had
bread
for
myself
and
family
and
this
was
more
than
poor
n
possessed
but
it
appeared
impossible
for
me
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
the
unhappy
sufferer
and
the
thought
of
my
incapacity
gave
me
severe
pain
it
was
only
in
moments
like
the
present
that
i
felt
the
curse
of
poverty
well
continued
my
friend
you
see
moodie
that
the
ladies
of
p
are
all
anxious
to
do
what
they
can
for
her
but
they
first
want
to
learn
if
the
miserable
circumstances
in
which
she
is
said
to
be
placed
are
true
in
short
my
dear
friend
they
want
you
and
me
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
dummer
to
see
the
poor
lady
herself
and
then
they
will
be
guided
by
our
then
let
us
lose
no
time
in
going
upon
our
own
mission
of
och
my
dear
heart
you
will
be
lost
in
the
woods
said
old
jenny
it
is
nine
long
miles
to
the
first
clearing
and
that
through
a
lonely
blazed
path
after
you
are
through
the
there
is
not
a
single
hut
for
you
to
rest
or
warm
yourselves
it
is
too
much
for
the
both
of
yees
you
will
be
frozen
to
death
on
the
no
fear
said
my
benevolent
friend
god
will
take
care
of
us
jenny
it
is
on
his
errand
we
go
to
carry
a
message
of
hope
to
one
about
to
the
lord
bless
you
for
a
darlint
cried
the
old
woman
devoutly
kissing
the
velvet
cheek
of
the
little
fellow
sleeping
upon
her
lap
may
your
own
purty
child
never
know
the
want
and
sorrow
that
is
around
emilia
and
i
talked
over
the
dummer
scheme
until
we
fell
asleep
many
were
the
plans
we
proposed
for
the
immediate
relief
of
the
unfortunate
family
early
the
next
morning
my
t
called
upon
my
friend
the
subject
next
to
our
heart
was
immediately
introduced
and
he
was
called
into
the
general
council
his
feelings
like
our
own
were
deeply
interested
and
he
proposed
that
we
should
each
provide
something
from
our
own
small
stores
to
satisfy
the
pressing
wants
of
the
distressed
family
while
he
promised
to
bring
his
cutter
the
next
morning
and
take
us
through
the
and
to
the
edge
of
the
great
swamp
which
would
shorten
four
miles
at
least
of
our
long
and
hazardous
journey
we
joyfully
acceded
to
his
proposal
and
set
cheerfully
to
work
to
provide
for
the
morrow
jenny
baked
a
batch
of
her
very
best
bread
and
boiled
a
large
piece
of
beef
and
t
brought
with
him
the
next
day
a
fine
cooked
ham
in
a
sack
into
the
bottom
of
which
he
stowed
the
beef
and
loaves
besides
some
sugar
and
tea
which
his
own
kind
wife
the
author
of
the
backwoods
of
canada
had
sent
i
had
some
misgivings
as
to
the
manner
in
which
these
good
things
could
be
introduced
to
the
poor
lady
who
i
had
heard
was
reserved
and
proud
oh
jenny
i
said
how
shall
i
be
able
to
ask
her
to
accept
provisions
from
strangers
i
am
afraid
of
wounding
her
oh
darlint
never
fear
that
she
is
proud
i
know
but
is
not
a
stiff
pride
but
jist
enough
to
consale
her
disthress
from
her
ignorant
english
neighbours
who
think
so
manely
of
poor
folk
like
her
who
were
once
rich
she
will
be
very
thankful
to
you
for
your
kindness
for
she
has
not
experienced
much
of
it
from
the
dummer
people
in
her
throuble
though
she
may
have
no
words
to
tell
you
so
say
that
old
jenny
sent
the
bread
to
dear
wee
ellie
she
knew
she
would
like
a
loaf
of
jenny
but
the
och
the
mate
is
it
may
be
you
think
of
some
excuse
for
the
mate
when
you
get
i
hope
so
but
i
a
sad
coward
with
strangers
and
i
have
lived
so
long
out
of
the
world
that
i
am
at
a
great
loss
what
to
do
i
will
try
and
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
your
name
jenny
will
be
no
small
help
to
all
was
now
ready
kissing
our
little
bairns
who
crowded
around
us
with
eager
and
inquiring
looks
and
charging
jenny
for
the
hundredth
time
to
take
especial
care
of
them
during
our
absence
we
mounted
the
cutter
and
set
off
under
the
care
and
protection
of
t
who
determined
to
accompany
us
on
the
journey
it
was
a
black
cold
day
no
sun
visible
in
the
grey
dark
sky
a
keen
wind
and
hard
frost
we
crouched
close
to
each
other
good
heavens
how
cold
it
is
whispered
emilia
what
a
day
for
such
a
journey
she
had
scarcely
ceased
speaking
when
the
cutter
went
upon
a
stump
which
lay
concealed
under
the
drifted
snow
and
we
together
with
the
ruins
of
our
conveyance
were
scattered
around
a
bad
beginning
said
my
with
a
rueful
aspect
as
he
surveyed
the
wreck
of
the
cutter
from
which
we
had
promised
ourselves
so
much
benefit
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
to
return
oh
no
said
s
bad
beginnings
make
good
endings
you
know
let
us
go
on
it
will
be
far
better
walking
than
riding
such
a
dreadful
day
my
feet
are
already
with
sitting
but
my
dear
madam
expostulated
t
consider
the
distance
the
road
the
dark
dull
day
and
our
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
path
i
will
get
the
cutter
mended
and
the
day
after
we
may
be
able
to
delays
are
dangerous
said
the
pertinacious
emilia
who
was
determined
to
have
her
own
way
now
or
never
while
we
wait
for
the
broken
cutter
the
n
may
starve
we
can
stop
at
colonel
c
and
warm
ourselves
and
you
can
leave
the
cutter
at
his
house
until
our
it
was
upon
your
account
that
i
proposed
the
delay
said
the
good
t
taking
the
sack
which
was
no
inconsiderable
weight
upon
his
shoulder
and
driving
his
horse
before
him
into
neighbour
w
stable
where
you
go
i
am
ready
to
when
we
arrived
colonel
c
family
were
at
breakfast
of
which
they
made
us
partake
and
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
dissuade
us
from
what
appeared
to
them
our
quixotic
expedition
c
added
a
dozen
fine
white
fish
to
the
contents
of
the
sack
and
sent
her
youngest
son
to
help
t
along
with
his
burthen
and
to
bear
us
company
on
our
desolate
road
leaving
the
colonel
hospitable
house
on
our
left
we
again
plunged
into
the
woods
and
after
a
few
minutes
brisk
walking
found
ourselves
upon
the
brow
of
a
steep
bank
that
overlooked
the
containing
within
its
area
several
hundred
acres
there
is
no
scenery
in
the
bush
that
presents
such
a
novel
appearance
as
those
meadows
or
openings
surrounded
as
they
invariably
are
by
dark
intricate
forests
their
high
rugged
banks
covered
with
the
light
airy
tamarack
and
silver
birch
in
summer
they
look
like
a
lake
of
soft
rich
verdure
hidden
in
the
bosom
of
the
barren
and
howling
waste
lakes
they
certainly
have
been
from
which
the
waters
have
receded
ages
ages
long
ago
and
still
the
whole
length
of
these
curious
level
valleys
is
traversed
by
a
stream
of
no
inconsiderable
dimensions
the
waters
of
the
narrow
rapid
creek
which
flowed
through
the
meadow
we
were
about
to
cross
were
of
sparkling
brightness
and
icy
cold
the
had
no
power
to
check
their
swift
dancing
movements
or
stop
their
perpetual
song
on
they
leaped
sparkling
and
flashing
beneath
their
banks
rejoicing
as
they
revelled
on
in
their
lonely
course
in
the
prime
of
the
year
this
is
a
wild
and
lovely
spot
the
grass
is
of
the
richest
green
and
the
flowers
of
the
most
gorgeous
dyes
the
gayest
butterflies
float
above
them
upon
painted
wings
and
the
pours
forth
from
the
neighbouring
woods
at
close
of
dewy
eve
his
strange
but
sadly
plaintive
cry
winter
was
now
upon
the
earth
and
the
once
green
meadow
looked
like
a
small
forest
lake
covered
with
snow
the
first
step
we
made
into
it
plunged
us
up
to
the
knees
in
the
snow
which
was
drifted
to
a
great
height
in
the
open
space
t
and
our
young
friend
c
walked
on
ahead
of
us
in
order
to
break
a
track
through
the
untrodden
snow
we
soon
reached
the
cold
creek
but
here
a
new
difficulty
presented
itself
it
was
too
wide
to
jump
across
and
we
could
see
no
other
way
of
passing
to
the
other
side
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
bridge
here
about
said
young
c
or
how
can
the
people
from
dummer
pass
constantly
during
the
winter
to
and
fro
i
will
go
along
the
bank
and
halloo
to
you
if
i
find
in
a
few
minutes
he
gave
the
desired
signal
and
on
reaching
the
spot
we
found
a
round
slippery
log
flung
across
the
stream
by
way
of
bridge
with
some
trouble
and
after
various
slips
we
got
safely
on
the
other
side
to
wet
our
feet
would
have
been
to
ensure
their
being
frozen
and
as
it
was
we
were
not
without
serious
apprehension
on
that
score
after
crossing
the
bleak
snowy
plain
we
scrambled
over
another
brook
and
entered
the
great
swamp
which
occupied
two
miles
of
our
dreary
road
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
giving
any
description
of
this
tangled
maze
of
cedars
fallen
trees
and
masses
of
rock
it
seemed
the
fitting
abode
of
wolves
and
bears
and
every
other
unclean
beast
the
fire
had
run
through
it
during
the
summer
making
the
confusion
doubly
confused
now
we
stooped
to
crawl
under
fallen
branches
that
hung
over
our
path
then
again
we
had
to
clamber
over
prostrate
trees
of
great
bulk
descending
from
which
we
plumped
down
into
holes
in
the
snow
sinking
into
the
rotten
trunk
of
some
treacherous
decayed
before
we
were
half
through
the
great
swamp
we
began
to
think
ourselves
sad
fools
and
to
wish
that
we
were
safe
again
by
our
own
firesides
but
then
a
great
object
was
in
view
the
relief
of
a
distressed
and
like
the
full
of
hope
misnamed
forlorn
we
determined
to
overcome
every
difficulty
and
toil
on
it
took
us
an
hour
at
least
to
clear
the
great
swamp
from
which
we
emerged
into
a
fine
wood
composed
chiefly
of
the
sun
had
during
our
immersion
in
the
dark
shades
of
the
swamp
burst
through
his
leaden
shroud
and
cast
a
cheery
gleam
along
the
rugged
boles
of
the
lofty
trees
the
squirrel
and
chipmunk
occasionally
bounded
across
our
path
the
dazzling
snow
which
covered
it
reflected
the
branches
above
us
in
an
endless
variety
of
dancing
shadows
our
spirits
rose
in
proportion
young
c
burst
out
singing
and
emilia
and
i
laughed
and
chatted
as
we
bounded
along
our
narrow
road
on
on
for
hours
the
same
interminable
forest
stretched
away
to
the
right
and
left
before
and
behind
us
it
is
past
twelve
said
my
brother
t
thoughtfully
if
we
do
not
soon
come
to
a
clearing
we
may
chance
to
spend
the
night
in
the
oh
i
am
dying
with
hunger
cried
emilia
do
c
give
us
one
or
two
of
the
cakes
your
mother
put
into
the
bag
for
us
to
eat
upon
the
the
were
instantly
produced
but
where
were
the
teeth
to
be
found
that
could
masticate
them
the
cakes
were
frozen
as
hard
as
stones
this
was
a
great
disappointment
to
us
tired
and
hungry
wights
but
it
only
produced
a
hearty
laugh
over
the
logs
we
went
again
for
it
was
a
perpetual
stepping
up
and
down
crossing
the
fallen
trees
that
obstructed
our
path
at
last
we
came
to
a
spot
where
two
distinct
blazed
roads
diverged
what
are
we
to
do
now
said
t
we
stopped
and
a
general
consultation
was
held
and
without
one
dissenting
voice
we
took
the
branch
to
the
right
which
after
pursuing
for
about
half
a
mile
led
us
to
a
log
hut
of
the
rudest
description
is
this
the
road
to
dummer
we
asked
a
man
who
was
chopping
wood
outside
the
fence
i
guess
you
are
in
dummer
was
the
answer
my
heart
leaped
for
joy
for
i
was
dreadfully
fatigued
does
this
road
lead
through
the
english
line
that
another
thing
returned
the
woodman
no
you
turned
off
from
the
right
path
when
you
came
up
we
all
looked
very
blank
at
each
other
you
will
have
to
go
back
and
keep
the
other
road
and
that
will
lead
you
straight
to
the
english
how
many
miles
is
it
to
n
some
four
or
thereabouts
was
the
cheering
rejoinder
is
one
of
the
last
clearings
on
the
line
if
you
are
going
back
to
douro
you
must
look
sadly
and
dejectedly
we
retraced
our
steps
there
are
few
trifling
failures
more
bitter
in
our
journey
through
life
than
that
of
a
tired
traveller
mistaking
his
road
what
effect
must
that
tremendous
failure
produce
upon
the
human
mind
when
at
the
end
of
unretraceable
journey
the
traveller
finds
that
he
has
fallen
upon
the
wrong
track
through
every
stage
and
instead
of
arriving
at
a
land
of
blissful
promise
sinks
for
ever
into
the
gulf
of
despair
the
distance
we
had
trodden
in
the
wrong
path
while
led
on
by
hope
and
anticipation
now
seemed
to
double
in
length
as
with
painful
steps
we
toiled
on
to
reach
the
right
road
this
object
once
attained
soon
led
us
to
the
dwellings
of
men
neat
comfortable
log
houses
surrounded
by
patches
of
clearing
arose
on
either
side
of
the
forest
road
dogs
flew
out
and
barked
at
us
and
children
ran
shouting
indoors
to
tell
their
respective
owners
that
strangers
were
passing
their
gates
a
most
unusual
circumstance
i
should
think
in
that
location
a
servant
who
had
hired
two
years
with
my
we
knew
must
live
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
at
whose
fireside
we
hoped
not
only
to
rest
and
warm
ourselves
but
to
obtain
something
to
eat
on
going
up
to
one
of
the
cabins
to
inquire
for
hannah
j
we
fortunately
happened
to
light
upon
the
very
person
we
sought
with
many
exclamations
of
surprise
she
ushered
us
into
her
neat
and
comfortable
log
dwelling
a
blazing
fire
composed
of
two
huge
logs
was
roaring
up
the
wide
chimney
and
the
savoury
smell
that
issued
from
a
large
pot
of
was
very
agreeable
to
our
cold
and
hungry
stomachs
but
alas
the
refreshment
went
no
further
hannah
most
politely
begged
us
to
take
seats
by
the
fire
and
warm
and
rest
ourselves
she
even
knelt
down
and
assisted
in
rubbing
our
hands
but
she
never
once
made
mention
of
the
hot
soup
or
of
the
tea
which
was
drawing
in
a
tin
teapot
upon
the
or
of
a
glass
of
whiskey
which
would
have
been
thankfully
accepted
by
our
male
pilgrims
hannah
was
not
an
irishwoman
no
nor
a
scotch
lassie
or
her
very
first
request
would
have
been
for
us
to
take
a
pickle
of
soup
or
a
sup
of
thae
warm
the
soup
was
no
doubt
cooking
for
hannah
husband
and
two
neighbours
who
were
chopping
for
him
in
the
bush
and
whose
want
of
punctuality
she
feelingly
lamented
as
we
left
her
cottage
and
jogged
on
emilia
whispered
laughing
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
your
good
dinner
was
not
the
excellent
and
that
cup
of
nice
hot
tea
i
never
relished
anything
more
in
my
life
i
think
we
should
never
pass
that
house
without
giving
hannah
a
call
and
testifying
our
gratitude
for
her
good
many
times
did
we
stop
to
inquire
the
way
to
n
before
we
ascended
the
steep
bleak
hill
upon
which
her
house
stood
at
the
door
t
deposited
the
sack
of
provisions
and
he
and
young
c
went
across
the
road
to
the
house
of
an
english
settler
who
fortunately
for
them
proved
more
hospitable
than
hannah
j
to
wait
until
our
errand
was
executed
the
house
before
which
emilia
and
i
were
standing
had
once
been
a
tolerably
comfortable
log
dwelling
it
was
larger
than
such
buildings
generally
are
and
was
surrounded
by
dilapidated
barns
and
stables
which
were
not
cheered
by
a
solitary
head
of
cattle
a
black
stretched
away
to
the
north
of
the
house
and
terminated
in
a
dismal
tangled
the
entrance
to
the
house
not
having
been
constructed
to
face
the
road
the
spirit
that
had
borne
me
up
during
the
journey
died
within
me
i
was
fearful
that
my
visit
would
be
deemed
an
impertinent
intrusion
i
knew
not
in
what
manner
to
introduce
myself
and
my
embarrassment
had
been
greatly
increased
by
s
declaring
that
i
must
break
the
ice
for
she
had
not
courage
to
go
in
i
remonstrated
but
she
was
firm
to
hold
any
longer
parley
was
impossible
we
were
standing
on
the
top
of
a
bleak
hill
with
the
thermometer
many
degrees
below
zero
and
exposed
to
the
fiercest
biting
of
the
bitter
cutting
blast
with
a
heavy
sigh
i
knocked
slowly
but
decidedly
at
the
crazy
door
i
saw
the
curly
head
of
a
boy
glance
for
a
moment
against
the
broken
window
there
was
a
stir
within
but
no
one
answered
our
summons
emilia
was
rubbing
her
hands
together
and
beating
a
rapid
tattoo
with
her
feet
upon
the
hard
and
glittering
snow
to
keep
them
from
freezing
again
i
appealed
to
the
inhospitable
door
with
a
vehemence
which
seemed
to
say
we
are
freezing
good
people
in
mercy
let
us
in
again
there
was
a
stir
and
a
whispered
sound
of
voices
as
if
in
consultation
from
within
and
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
longer
which
cold
as
we
were
seemed
an
age
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
by
a
handsome
lad
of
twelve
years
of
age
who
was
evidently
the
owner
of
the
curly
head
that
had
been
sent
to
reconnoitre
us
through
the
window
carefully
closing
the
door
after
him
he
stepped
out
upon
the
snow
and
asked
us
coldly
but
respectfully
what
we
wanted
i
told
him
that
we
were
two
ladies
who
had
walked
all
the
way
from
douro
to
see
his
mamma
and
that
we
wished
very
much
to
speak
to
her
the
lad
answered
us
with
the
ease
and
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
that
he
did
not
know
whether
his
mamma
could
be
seen
by
strangers
but
he
would
go
in
and
see
so
saying
he
abruptly
left
us
leaving
behind
him
an
ugly
skeleton
of
a
dog
who
after
expressing
his
disapprobation
at
our
presence
in
the
most
disagreeable
and
unequivocal
manner
pounced
like
a
famished
wolf
upon
the
sack
of
good
things
which
lay
at
emilia
feet
and
our
united
efforts
could
scarcely
keep
him
off
a
cold
doubtful
reception
this
said
my
friend
turning
her
back
to
the
wind
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
muff
this
is
worse
than
hannah
liberality
and
the
long
weary
i
thought
so
too
and
began
to
apprehend
that
our
walk
had
been
in
vain
when
the
lad
again
appeared
and
said
that
we
might
walk
in
for
his
mother
was
dressed
emilia
true
to
her
determination
went
no
farther
than
the
passage
in
vain
were
all
my
entreating
looks
and
mute
appeals
to
her
benevolence
and
friendship
i
was
forced
to
enter
alone
the
apartment
that
contained
the
distressed
family
i
felt
that
i
was
treading
upon
sacred
ground
for
a
pitying
angel
hovers
over
the
abode
of
suffering
virtue
and
hallows
all
its
woes
on
a
rude
bench
before
the
fire
sat
a
lady
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
dressed
in
a
thin
coloured
muslin
gown
the
most
inappropriate
garment
for
the
rigour
of
the
season
but
in
all
probability
the
only
decent
one
that
she
retained
a
subdued
melancholy
looked
forth
from
her
large
dark
pensive
eyes
she
appeared
like
one
who
having
discovered
the
full
extent
of
her
misery
had
proudly
steeled
her
heart
to
bear
it
her
countenance
was
very
pleasing
and
in
early
life
but
she
was
still
young
she
must
have
been
eminently
handsome
near
her
with
her
head
bent
down
and
shaded
by
her
thin
slender
hand
her
slight
figure
scarcely
covered
by
her
scanty
clothing
sat
her
eldest
daughter
a
gentle
girl
who
held
in
her
arms
a
baby
brother
whose
destitution
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
was
a
touching
sight
that
suffering
girl
just
stepping
into
womanhood
hiding
against
her
young
bosom
the
nakedness
of
the
little
creature
she
loved
another
fine
boy
whose
clothes
had
not
one
piece
of
the
original
stuff
apparently
left
in
them
stood
behind
his
mother
with
dark
glistening
eyes
fastened
upon
me
as
if
amused
and
wondering
who
i
was
and
what
business
i
could
have
there
a
pale
and
attenuated
but
very
pretty
little
girl
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
before
the
fire
this
was
old
jenny
darling
ellie
or
eloise
a
rude
bedstead
of
home
manufacture
in
a
corner
of
the
room
covered
with
a
coarse
woollen
quilt
contained
two
little
boys
who
had
crept
into
it
to
conceal
their
wants
from
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
on
the
table
lay
a
dozen
peeled
potatoes
and
a
small
pot
was
boiling
on
the
fire
to
receive
their
scanty
and
only
daily
meal
there
was
such
an
air
of
patient
and
enduring
suffering
to
the
whole
group
that
as
i
gazed
upon
it
my
fortitude
quite
gave
way
and
i
burst
into
tears
n
first
broke
the
painful
silence
and
rather
proudly
asked
me
to
whom
she
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
i
made
a
desperate
effort
to
regain
my
composure
and
told
her
but
with
much
embarrassment
my
name
adding
that
i
was
so
well
acquainted
with
her
and
her
children
through
jenny
that
i
could
not
consider
her
as
a
stranger
that
i
hoped
that
as
i
was
the
wife
of
an
officer
and
like
her
a
resident
in
the
bush
and
well
acquainted
with
all
its
trials
and
privations
she
would
look
upon
me
as
a
friend
she
seemed
surprised
and
annoyed
and
i
found
no
small
difficulty
in
introducing
the
object
of
my
visit
but
the
day
was
rapidly
declining
and
i
knew
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
at
first
she
coldly
rejected
all
offers
of
service
and
said
that
she
was
contented
and
wanted
for
nothing
i
appealed
to
the
situation
in
which
i
beheld
herself
and
her
children
and
implored
her
for
their
sakes
not
to
refuse
help
from
friends
who
felt
for
her
distress
her
maternal
feelings
triumphed
over
her
assumed
indifference
and
when
she
saw
me
weeping
for
i
could
no
longer
restrain
my
tears
her
pride
yielded
and
for
some
minutes
not
a
word
was
spoken
i
heard
the
large
tears
as
they
slowly
fell
from
her
daughter
eyes
drop
one
by
one
upon
her
garments
at
last
the
poor
girl
sobbed
out
dear
mamma
why
conceal
the
truth
you
know
that
we
are
nearly
naked
and
then
came
the
sad
tale
of
domestic
woes
the
absence
of
the
husband
and
eldest
son
the
uncertainty
as
to
where
they
were
or
in
what
engaged
the
utter
want
of
means
to
procure
the
common
necessaries
of
life
the
sale
of
the
only
remaining
cow
that
used
to
provide
the
children
with
food
it
had
been
sold
for
twelve
dollars
part
to
be
paid
in
cash
part
in
potatoes
the
potatoes
were
nearly
exhausted
and
they
were
allowanced
to
so
many
a
day
but
the
six
dollars
she
had
retained
as
their
last
resource
alas
she
had
sent
the
eldest
boy
the
day
before
to
p
to
get
a
letter
out
of
the
which
she
hoped
contained
some
tidings
of
her
husband
and
son
she
was
all
anxiety
and
expectation
but
the
child
returned
late
at
night
without
the
letter
which
they
had
longed
for
with
such
feverish
impatience
the
six
dollars
upon
which
they
had
depended
for
a
supply
of
food
were
in
notes
of
the
farmer
bank
which
at
that
time
would
not
pass
for
money
and
which
the
roguish
purchaser
of
the
cow
had
passed
off
upon
this
distressed
family
oh
imagine
ye
who
revel
in
riches
who
can
daily
throw
away
a
large
sum
upon
the
merest
toy
the
cruel
disappointment
the
bitter
agony
of
this
poor
mother
heart
when
she
received
this
calamitous
news
in
the
midst
of
her
starving
children
for
the
last
nine
weeks
they
had
lived
upon
a
scanty
supply
of
potatoes
they
had
not
tasted
raised
bread
or
animal
food
for
eighteen
months
ellie
said
i
anxious
to
introduce
the
sack
which
had
lain
like
a
nightmare
upon
my
mind
i
have
something
for
you
jenny
baked
some
loaves
last
night
and
sent
them
to
you
with
her
best
the
eyes
of
all
the
children
grew
bright
you
will
find
the
sack
with
the
bread
in
the
passage
said
i
to
one
of
the
boys
he
rushed
joyfully
out
and
returned
with
and
the
sack
her
bland
and
affectionate
greeting
restored
us
all
to
tranquillity
the
delighted
boy
opened
the
sack
the
first
thing
he
produced
was
the
ham
oh
said
i
that
is
a
ham
that
my
sister
sent
to
n
is
of
her
own
curing
and
she
thought
that
it
might
be
then
came
the
white
fish
nicely
packed
in
a
clean
cloth
mrs
c
thought
fish
might
be
a
treat
to
n
as
she
lived
so
far
from
the
great
then
came
jenny
bread
which
had
already
been
introduced
the
beef
and
tea
and
sugar
fell
upon
the
floor
without
any
comment
the
first
scruples
had
been
overcome
and
the
day
was
ours
and
now
ladies
said
n
with
true
hospitality
since
you
have
brought
refreshments
with
you
permit
me
to
cook
something
for
your
the
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
had
produced
such
a
choking
sensation
that
all
my
hunger
had
vanished
before
we
could
accept
or
refuse
n
kind
offer
t
arrived
to
hurry
us
off
it
was
two
when
we
descended
the
hill
in
front
of
the
house
that
led
by
a
round
to
the
road
and
commenced
our
homeward
route
i
thought
the
four
miles
of
clearings
would
never
be
passed
and
the
english
line
appeared
to
have
no
end
at
length
we
entered
once
more
the
dark
forest
the
setting
sun
gleamed
along
the
ground
the
necessity
of
exerting
our
utmost
speed
and
getting
through
the
great
swamp
before
darkness
surrounded
us
was
apparent
to
all
the
men
strode
vigorously
forward
for
they
had
been
refreshed
with
a
substantial
dinner
of
potatoes
and
pork
washed
down
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
at
the
cottage
in
which
they
had
waited
for
us
but
poor
emilia
and
i
faint
hungry
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
we
could
keep
up
i
thought
of
rosalind
as
our
march
up
and
down
the
fallen
logs
recommenced
and
often
exclaimed
with
her
oh
jupiter
how
weary
are
my
legs
night
closed
in
just
as
we
reached
the
here
our
ears
were
greeted
with
the
sound
of
voices
james
and
henry
c
had
brought
the
to
meet
us
at
the
edge
of
the
bush
never
was
splendid
equipage
greeted
with
such
delight
emilia
and
i
now
fairly
exhausted
with
fatigue
scrambled
into
it
and
lying
down
on
the
straw
which
covered
the
bottom
of
the
rude
vehicle
we
drew
the
buffalo
robes
over
our
faces
and
actually
slept
soundly
until
we
reached
colonel
c
hospitable
door
an
excellent
supper
of
hot
fish
and
fried
venison
was
smoking
on
the
table
with
other
good
cheer
to
which
we
did
ample
justice
i
for
one
never
was
so
hungry
in
my
life
we
had
fasted
for
twelve
hours
and
that
on
an
intensely
cold
day
and
had
walked
during
that
period
upwards
of
twenty
miles
never
never
shall
i
forget
that
weary
walk
to
dummer
but
a
blessing
followed
it
it
was
midnight
when
emilia
and
i
reached
my
humble
home
our
good
friends
the
oxen
being
again
put
in
requisition
to
carry
us
there
emilia
went
immediately
to
bed
from
which
she
was
unable
to
rise
for
several
days
in
the
meanwhile
i
wrote
to
moodie
an
account
of
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
and
he
raised
a
subscription
among
the
officers
of
the
regiment
for
the
poor
lady
and
her
children
which
amounted
to
forty
dollars
emilia
lost
no
time
in
making
a
full
report
to
her
friends
at
p
and
before
a
week
passed
away
n
and
her
family
were
removed
thither
by
several
benevolent
individuals
in
the
place
a
neat
cottage
was
hired
for
her
and
to
the
honour
of
canada
be
it
spoken
all
who
could
afford
a
donation
gave
cheerfully
farmers
left
at
her
door
pork
beef
flour
and
potatoes
the
storekeepers
sent
groceries
and
goods
to
make
clothes
for
the
children
the
shoemakers
contributed
boots
for
the
boys
while
the
ladies
did
all
in
their
power
to
assist
and
comfort
the
gentle
creature
thus
thrown
by
providence
upon
their
bounty
while
n
remained
at
p
she
did
not
want
for
any
comfort
her
children
were
clothed
and
her
rent
paid
by
her
benevolent
friends
and
her
house
supplied
with
food
and
many
comforts
from
the
same
source
respected
and
beloved
by
all
who
knew
her
it
would
have
been
well
had
she
never
left
the
quiet
asylum
where
for
several
years
she
enjoyed
tranquillity
and
a
respectable
competence
from
her
school
but
in
an
evil
hour
she
followed
her
worthless
husband
to
the
southern
states
and
again
suffered
all
the
woes
which
drunkenness
inflicts
upon
the
wives
and
children
of
its
degraded
victims
the
convict
wife
pale
matron
i
see
thee
in
agony
steep
the
pillow
on
which
thy
young
innocents
sleep
their
slumbers
are
tranquil
unbroken
their
rest
they
know
not
the
grief
that
convulses
thy

a

in
our
prospects
the

flower
lies
folded
in

its

fragrance
graceful
form
carefully
shrouded
in
that
tiny
cell
till

and

and

and

expand
the

blossom
and
it
bursts
its

its

o

the

visit
in
vain
the
sear
and
blighted
flower
during
my
illness
a
kind
neighbour
who
had
not
only
frequently
come
to
see
me
but
had
brought
me
many
nourishing
things
made
by
her
own
fair
hands
took
a
great
fancy
to
my
second
daughter
who
lively
and
volatile
could
not
be
induced
to
remain
quiet
in
the
sick
chamber
the
noise
she
made
greatly
retarded
my
recovery
and
h
took
her
home
with
her
as
the
only
means
of
obtaining
for
me
necessary
rest
during
that
winter
and
through
the
ensuing
summer
i
only
received
occasional
visits
from
my
little
girl
who
fairly
established
with
her
new
friends
looked
upon
their
house
as
her
home
this
separation
which
was
felt
as
a
great
benefit
at
the
time
greatly
estranged
the
affections
of
the
child
from
her
own
people
she
saw
us
so
seldom
that
she
almost
regarded
us
when
she
did
meet
as
strangers
and
i
often
deeply
lamented
the
hour
when
i
had
unwittingly
suffered
the
threefold
cord
of
domestic
love
to
be
unravelled
by
absence
and
the
flattering
attentions
which
fed
the
vanity
of
a
beautiful
child
without
strengthening
her
moral
character
h
whose
husband
was
wealthy
was
a
generous
girl
of
eighteen
lovely
in
person
and
fascinating
in
manners
and
still
too
young
to
have
any
idea
of
forming
the
character
of
a
child
she
dressed
the
little
creature
expensively
and
by
constantly
praising
her
personal
appearance
gave
her
an
idea
of
her
own
importance
which
it
took
many
years
to
eradicate
it
is
a
great
error
to
suffer
a
child
who
has
been
trained
in
the
hard
school
of
poverty
and
to
be
transplanted
suddenly
into
the
of
wealth
and
luxury
the
idea
of
the
child
being
so
much
happier
and
better
off
blinds
her
fond
parents
to
the
dangers
of
her
new
situation
where
she
is
sure
to
contract
a
dislike
to
all
useful
occupation
and
to
look
upon
scanty
means
and
plain
clothing
as
a
disgrace
if
the
is
bad
for
a
person
it
is
almost
destructive
to
a
child
who
is
incapable
of
moral
reflection
whenever
i
saw
little
addie
and
remarked
the
growing
coldness
of
her
manner
towards
us
my
heart
reproached
me
for
having
exposed
her
to
temptation
still
in
the
eye
of
the
world
she
was
much
better
situated
than
she
could
possibly
be
with
us
the
heart
of
the
parent
could
alone
understand
the
change
so
sensible
was
her
father
of
this
alteration
that
the
first
time
he
paid
us
a
visit
he
went
and
brought
home
his
child
if
she
remain
so
long
away
from
us
at
her
tender
years
he
said
she
will
cease
to
love
us
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
would
not
compensate
me
for
the
love
of
my
the
removal
of
my
sister
rendered
my
separation
from
my
husband
doubly
lonely
and
irksome
sometimes
the
desire
to
see
and
converse
with
him
would
press
so
painfully
on
my
heart
that
i
would
get
up
in
the
night
strike
a
light
and
sit
down
and
write
him
a
long
letter
and
tell
him
all
that
was
in
my
mind
and
when
i
had
thus
unburdened
my
spirit
the
letter
was
committed
to
the
flames
and
after
fervently
commending
him
to
the
care
of
the
great
father
of
mankind
i
would
lay
down
my
throbbing
head
on
my
pillow
beside
our
son
and
sleep
tranquilly
it
is
a
strange
fact
that
many
of
my
husband
letters
to
me
were
written
at
the
very
time
when
i
felt
those
irresistible
impulses
to
hold
communion
with
him
why
should
we
be
ashamed
to
admit
openly
our
belief
in
this
mysterious
intercourse
between
the
spirits
of
those
who
are
bound
to
each
other
by
the
tender
ties
of
friendship
and
affection
when
the
experience
of
every
day
proves
its
truth
proverbs
which
are
the
wisdom
of
ages
collected
into
a
few
brief
words
tell
us
in
one
pithy
sentence
that
if
we
talk
of
the
devil
he
is
sure
to
while
the
name
of
a
friend
is
in
our
mouth
the
next
moment
brings
him
into
our
presence
how
can
this
be
if
mind
did
not
meet
mind
and
the
spirit
had
not
a
prophetic
consciousness
of
the
vicinity
of
another
spirit
kindred
with
its
own
this
is
an
occurrence
so
common
that
i
never
met
with
any
person
to
whom
it
had
not
happened
few
will
admit
it
to
be
a
spiritual
agency
but
in
no
other
way
can
they
satisfactorily
explain
its
cause
if
it
were
a
mere
coincidence
or
combination
of
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
not
happen
so
often
and
people
would
not
be
led
to
speak
of
the
always
at
the
moment
when
they
are
just
about
to
present
themselves
before
them
my
husband
was
no
believer
in
what
he
termed
my
fanciful
speculative
theories
yet
at
the
time
when
his
youngest
boy
and
myself
lay
dangerously
ill
and
hardly
expected
to
live
i
received
from
him
a
letter
written
in
great
haste
which
commenced
with
this
sentence
do
write
to
me
dear
s
when
you
receive
this
i
have
felt
very
uneasy
about
you
for
some
days
past
and
am
afraid
that
all
is
not
right
at
whence
came
this
sudden
fear
why
at
that
particular
time
did
his
thoughts
turn
so
despondingly
towards
those
so
dear
to
him
why
did
the
dark
cloud
in
his
mind
hang
so
heavily
above
his
home
the
burden
of
my
weary
and
distressed
spirit
had
reached
him
and
without
knowing
of
our
sufferings
and
danger
his
own
responded
to
the
call
the
holy
and
mysterious
nature
of
man
is
yet
hidden
from
himself
he
is
still
a
stranger
to
the
movements
of
that
inner
life
and
knows
little
of
its
capabilities
and
powers
a
purer
religion
a
higher
standard
of
moral
and
intellectual
training
may
in
time
reveal
all
this
man
still
remains
a
savage
the
leaven
of
christianity
is
surely
working
its
way
but
it
has
not
yet
changed
the
whole
lump
or
transformed
the
deformed
into
the
beauteous
child
of
god
oh
for
that
glorious
day
it
is
coming
the
dark
clouds
of
humanity
are
already
tinged
with
the
golden
radiance
of
the
dawn
but
the
sun
of
righteousness
has
not
yet
arisen
upon
the
world
with
healing
on
his
wings
the
light
of
truth
still
struggles
in
the
womb
of
darkness
and
man
stumbles
on
to
the
fulfilment
of
his
sublime
and
mysterious
destiny
this
spring
i
was
not
a
little
puzzled
how
to
get
in
the
crops
i
still
continued
so
weak
that
i
was
quite
unable
to
assist
in
the
field
and
my
good
old
jenny
was
sorely
troubled
with
inflamed
feet
which
required
constant
care
at
this
juncture
a
neighbouring
settler
who
had
recently
come
among
us
offered
to
put
in
my
small
crop
of
peas
potatoes
and
oats
in
all
not
comprising
more
than
eight
acres
if
i
would
lend
him
my
oxen
to
a
large
fallow
of
ten
acres
and
put
in
his
own
crops
trusting
to
his
fair
dealing
i
consented
to
this
arrangement
but
he
took
advantage
of
my
isolated
position
and
not
only
his
fallow
but
put
in
all
his
spring
crops
before
he
sowed
an
acre
of
mine
the
oxen
were
worked
down
so
low
that
they
were
almost
unfit
for
use
and
my
crops
were
put
in
so
late
and
with
such
little
care
that
they
all
proved
a
failure
i
should
have
felt
this
loss
more
severely
had
it
happened
in
any
previous
year
but
i
had
ceased
to
feel
that
deep
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
farm
from
a
sort
of
conviction
in
my
own
mind
that
it
would
not
long
remain
my
home
jenny
and
i
did
our
best
in
the
way
of
hoeing
and
weeding
but
no
industry
on
our
part
could
repair
the
injury
done
to
the
seed
by
being
sown
out
of
season
we
therefore
confined
our
attention
to
the
garden
which
as
usual
was
very
productive
and
with
milk
fresh
butter
and
eggs
supplied
the
simple
wants
of
our
family
emilia
enlivened
our
solitude
by
her
company
for
several
weeks
during
the
summer
and
we
had
many
pleasant
excursions
on
the
water
together
my
knowledge
of
the
use
of
the
paddle
however
was
not
entirely
without
its
danger
one
very
windy
sunday
afternoon
a
who
lived
with
my
friend
c
came
crying
to
the
house
and
implored
the
use
of
my
canoe
and
paddles
to
cross
the
lake
to
see
her
dying
father
the
request
was
instantly
granted
but
there
was
no
man
upon
the
place
to
ferry
her
across
and
she
could
not
manage
the
boat
herself
in
short
had
never
been
in
a
canoe
in
her
life
the
girl
was
deeply
distressed
she
said
that
she
had
got
word
that
her
father
could
scarcely
live
till
she
could
reach
that
if
she
went
round
by
the
bridge
she
must
walk
five
miles
while
if
she
crossed
the
lake
she
could
be
home
in
half
an
hour
i
did
not
much
like
the
angry
swell
upon
the
water
but
the
poor
creature
was
in
such
grief
that
i
told
her
if
she
was
not
afraid
of
venturing
with
me
i
would
try
and
put
her
over
she
expressed
her
thanks
in
the
warmest
terms
accompanied
by
a
shower
of
blessings
and
i
took
the
paddles
and
went
down
to
the
landing
jenny
was
very
averse
to
my
tempting
providence
as
she
termed
it
and
wished
that
i
might
get
back
as
safe
as
i
went
however
the
old
woman
launched
the
canoe
for
me
pushed
us
from
the
shore
and
away
we
went
the
wind
was
in
my
favour
and
i
found
so
little
trouble
in
getting
across
that
i
began
to
laugh
at
my
own
timidity
i
put
the
girl
on
shore
and
endeavoured
to
shape
my
passage
home
but
this
i
found
was
no
easy
task
the
water
was
rough
and
the
wind
high
and
the
strong
current
which
runs
through
that
part
of
the
lake
to
the
smith
rapids
was
dead
against
me
in
vain
i
laboured
to
cross
this
current
it
resisted
all
my
efforts
and
at
each
repulse
i
was
carried
farther
down
towards
the
rapids
which
were
full
of
sunken
rocks
and
hard
for
the
strong
arm
of
a
man
to
stem
to
the
weak
hand
of
a
woman
their
safe
passage
was
impossible
i
began
to
feel
rather
uneasy
at
the
awkward
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
placed
and
for
some
time
i
made
desperate
efforts
to
extricate
myself
by
paddling
with
all
my
might
i
soon
gave
this
up
and
contented
myself
by
steering
the
canoe
in
the
path
that
it
thought
fit
to
pursue
after
drifting
down
with
the
current
for
some
little
space
until
i
came
opposite
a
small
island
i
put
out
all
my
strength
to
gain
the
land
in
this
i
fortunately
succeeded
and
getting
on
shore
i
contrived
to
drag
the
canoe
so
far
round
the
headland
that
i
got
her
out
of
the
current
all
now
was
smooth
sailing
and
i
joyfully
answered
old
jenny
yells
from
the
landing
that
i
was
safe
and
would
join
her
in
a
few
minutes
this
fortunate
manoeuvre
stood
me
in
good
stead
upon
another
occasion
when
crossing
the
lake
some
weeks
after
this
in
company
with
a
young
female
friend
during
a
sudden
storm
two
indian
women
heavily
laden
with
their
packs
of
dried
venison
called
at
the
house
to
borrow
the
canoe
to
join
their
encampment
upon
the
other
side
it
so
happened
that
i
wanted
to
send
to
the
mill
that
afternoon
and
the
boat
could
not
be
returned
in
time
without
i
went
over
with
the
indian
women
and
brought
it
back
my
young
friend
was
delighted
at
the
idea
of
the
frolic
and
as
she
could
both
steer
and
paddle
and
the
day
was
calm
and
bright
though
excessively
warm
we
both
agreed
to
accompany
the
squaws
to
the
other
side
and
bring
back
the
canoe
muskrat
has
fallen
in
love
with
a
fine
fat
kitten
whom
the
children
had
called
buttermilk
and
she
begged
so
hard
for
the
little
puss
that
i
presented
it
to
her
rather
marvelling
how
she
would
contrive
to
carry
it
so
many
miles
through
the
woods
and
she
loaded
with
such
an
enormous
pack
when
lo
the
squaw
took
down
the
bundle
and
in
the
heart
of
the
piles
of
dried
venison
she
deposited
the
cat
in
a
small
basket
giving
it
a
thin
slice
of
the
meat
to
console
it
for
its
close
confinement
puss
received
the
donation
with
piteous
mews
it
was
evident
that
mice
and
freedom
were
preferred
by
her
to
venison
and
the
honour
of
riding
on
a
squaw
back
the
squaws
paddled
us
quickly
across
and
we
laughed
and
chatted
as
we
bounded
over
the
blue
waves
until
we
were
landed
in
a
dark
in
the
heart
of
which
we
found
the
indian
encampment
a
large
party
were
lounging
around
the
fire
superintending
the
drying
of
a
quantity
of
venison
which
was
suspended
on
forked
sticks
besides
the
flesh
of
the
deer
a
number
of
were
skinned
and
extended
as
if
standing
bolt
upright
before
the
fire
warming
their
paws
the
appearance
they
cut
was
most
ludicrous
my
young
friend
pointed
to
the
as
she
sank
down
laughing
upon
one
of
the
skins
old
who
was
present
imagined
that
she
wanted
one
of
them
to
eat
and
very
gravely
handed
her
the
unsavoury
beast
stick
and
all
does
the
old
man
take
me
for
a
cannibal
she
said
i
would
as
soon
eat
a
among
the
many
odd
things
cooking
at
that
fire
there
was
something
that
had
the
appearance
of
a
what
can
that
be
she
said
directing
my
eyes
to
the
strange
monster
surely
they
do
eat
this
sally
was
received
by
a
grunt
of
approbation
from
and
though
indians
seldom
forget
their
dignity
so
far
as
to
laugh
he
for
once
laid
aside
his
stoical
gravity
and
twirling
the
thing
round
with
a
stick
burst
into
a
hearty
peal
muckakee

i
wish

much

of
the

morsel
said
the
saucy
girl
who
was
intent
upon
quizzing
and
examining
everything
in
the
camp
we
had
remained
the
best
part
of
an
hour
when
muskrat
laid
hold
of
my
hand
and
leading
me
through
the
bush
to
the
shore
pointed
up
significantly
to
a
cloud
as
dark
as
night
that
hung
loweringly
over
the
bush
thunder
in
that
cloud
get
over
the
lake
quick
quick
before
it
then
motioning
for
us
to
jump
into
the
canoe
she
threw
in
the
paddles
and
pushed
us
from
shore
we
saw
the
necessity
of
haste
and
both
plied
the
paddle
with
diligence
to
gain
the
opposite
bank
or
at
least
the
shelter
of
the
island
before
the
cloud
poured
down
its
fury
upon
us
we
were
just
in
the
middle
of
the
current
when
the
first
peal
of
thunder
broke
with
startling
nearness
over
our
heads
the
storm
frowned
darkly
upon
the
woods
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
and
there
were
we
exposed
to
its
utmost
fury
in
the
middle
of
a
current
too
strong
for
us
to
stem
what
shall
we
do
we
shall
be
drowned
said
my
young
friend
turning
her
pale
tearful
face
towards
me
let
the
canoe
float
down
the
current
till
we
get
close
to
the
island
then
run
her
into
the
land
i
saved
myself
once
before
by
this
we
did
so
and
were
safe
but
there
we
had
to
remain
wet
to
our
skins
until
the
wind
and
the
rain
abated
sufficiently
for
us
to
manage
our
little
craft
how
do
you
like
being
upon
the
lake
in
a
storm
like
this
i
whispered
to
my
shivering
dripping
companion
very
well
in
romance
but
terribly
dull
in
reality
we
can
not
however
call
it
a
dry
joke
continued
she
wringing
the
rain
from
her
dress
i
wish
we
were
suspended
over
old
fire
with
the
for
i
hate
a
with
my
clothes
i
took
warning
by
this
adventure
never
to
cross
the
lake
again
without
a
stronger
arm
than
mine
in
the
canoe
to
steer
me
safely
through
the
current
i
received
much
kind
attention
from
my
new
neighbour
the
rev
w
a
truly
excellent
and
pious
clergyman
of
the
english
church
the
good
old
man
expressed
the
kindest
sympathy
in
all
my
trials
and
strengthened
me
greatly
with
his
benevolent
counsels
and
gentle
charity
w
was
a
true
follower
of
christ
his
christianity
was
not
confined
to
his
own
denomination
and
every
sabbath
his
log
cottage
was
filled
with
attentive
auditors
of
all
persuasions
who
met
together
to
listen
to
the
word
of
life
delivered
to
them
by
a
christian
minister
in
the
wilderness
he
had
been
a
very
fine
preacher
and
though
considerably
turned
of
seventy
his
voice
was
still
excellent
and
his
manner
solemn
and
impressive
his
only
son
a
young
man
of
years
of
age
had
received
a
serious
injury
in
the
brain
by
falling
upon
a
from
a
loft
window
when
a
child
and
his
intellect
had
remained
stationary
from
that
time
poor
harry
was
an
innocent
child
he
loved
his
parents
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
and
all
who
spoke
kindly
to
him
he
regarded
as
friends
like
most
persons
of
his
caste
of
mind
his
predilection
for
pet
animals
was
a
prominent
instinct
he
was
always
followed
by
two
dogs
whom
he
regarded
with
especial
favour
the
moment
he
caught
your
eye
he
looked
down
admiringly
upon
his
attendants
patting
their
sleek
necks
and
murmuring
nice
dogs
nice
harry
had
singled
out
myself
and
my
little
ones
as
great
favourites
he
would
gather
flowers
for
the
girls
and
catch
butterflies
for
the
boys
while
to
me
he
always
gave
the
title
of
dear
it
so
happened
that
one
fine
morning
i
wanted
to
walk
a
couple
of
miles
through
the
bush
to
spend
the
day
with
c
but
the
woods
were
full
of
the
cattle
belonging
to
the
neighbouring
settlers
and
of
these
i
was
terribly
afraid
whilst
i
was
dressing
the
little
girls
to
accompany
me
harry
w
came
in
with
a
message
from
his
mother
oh
thought
i
here
is
harry
w
he
will
walk
with
us
through
the
bush
and
defend
us
from
the
the
proposition
was
made
and
harry
was
not
a
little
proud
of
being
invited
to
join
our
party
we
had
accomplished
half
the
distance
without
seeing
a
single
hoof
and
i
was
beginning
to
congratulate
myself
upon
our
unusual
luck
when
a
large
red
ox
maddened
by
the
stings
of
the
came
headlong
through
the
brush
tossing
up
the
withered
leaves
and
dried
moss
with
his
horns
and
making
directly
towards
us
i
screamed
to
my
champion
for
help
but
where
was
he
running
like
a
frightened
chipmunk
along
the
fallen
timber
shouting
to
my
eldest
girl
at
the
top
of
his
voice
run
katty
run
the
bull
the
bull
run
katty
the
bull
the
bull
leaving
us
poor
creatures
far
behind
in
the
chase
the
bull
who
cared
not
one
fig
for
us
did
not
even
stop
to
give
us
a
passing
stare
and
was
soon
lost
among
the
trees
while
our
valiant
knight
never
stopped
to
see
what
had
become
of
us
but
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
so
much
for
taking
an
innocent
for
a
guard
the
next
month
most
of
the
militia
regiments
were
disbanded
my
husband
services
were
no
longer
required
at
b
and
he
once
more
returned
to
help
to
gather
in
our
scanty
harvest
many
of
the
old
debts
were
paid
off
by
his
pay
and
though
all
hope
of
continuing
in
the
militia
service
was
at
an
end
our
condition
was
so
much
improved
that
we
looked
less
to
the
dark
than
to
the
sunny
side
of
the
landscape
the
potato
crop
was
gathered
in
and
i
had
collected
my
store
of
for
our
winter
supply
of
coffee
when
one
day
brought
a
letter
to
my
husband
from
the
governor
secretary
offering
him
the
situation
of
sheriff
of
the
v
district
though
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
difficulties
and
responsibilities
of
such
an
important
office
my
husband
looked
upon
it
as
a
gift
sent
from
heaven
to
remove
us
from
the
sorrows
and
poverty
with
which
we
were
surrounded
in
the
woods
once
more
he
bade
us
farewell
but
it
was
to
go
and
make
ready
a
home
for
us
that
we
should
no
more
be
separated
from
each
other
heartily
did
i
return
thanks
to
god
that
night
for
all
his
mercies
to
us
and
sir
george
arthur
was
not
forgotten
in
those
prayers
from
b
my
husband
wrote
to
me
to
make
what
haste
i
could
in
disposing
of
our
crops
household
furniture
stock
and
farming
implements
and
to
prepare
myself
and
the
children
to
join
him
on
the
first
fall
of
snow
that
would
make
the
roads
practicable
for
sleighing
to
facilitate
this
object
he
sent
me
a
box
of
clothing
to
make
up
for
myself
and
the
children
for
seven
years
i
had
lived
out
of
the
world
entirely
my
person
had
been
rendered
coarse
by
hard
work
and
exposure
to
the
weather
i
looked
double
the
age
i
really
was
and
my
hair
was
already
thickly
sprinkled
with
grey
i
clung
to
my
solitude
i
did
not
like
to
be
dragged
from
it
to
mingle
in
gay
scenes
in
a
busy
town
and
with
people
i
was
no
longer
fit
for
the
world
i
had
lost
all
relish
for
the
pursuits
and
pleasures
which
are
so
essential
to
its
votaries
i
was
contented
to
live
and
die
in
obscurity
my
dear
emilia
rejoiced
like
a
true
friend
in
my
changed
prospects
and
came
up
to
help
me
to
cut
clothes
for
the
children
and
to
assist
me
in
preparing
them
for
the
journey
i
succeeded
in
selling
off
our
goods
and
chattels
much
better
than
i
expected
my
old
friend
w
who
was
a
new
comer
became
the
principal
purchaser
and
when
christmas
arrived
i
had
not
one
article
left
upon
my
hands
save
the
bedding
which
it
was
necessary
to
take
with
us
the
magic
spell
the
magic
spell
the
dream
is
fled
the
dream
of
joy
sent
from
above
the
idol
of
my
soul
is
dead
and
naught
remains
but
hopeless
love
the
song
of
birds
the
scent
of
flowers
the
tender
light
of
parting
day
unheeded
now
the
tardy
hours
steal
sadly
silently
away
but
welcome
now
the
solemn
night
when
watchful
stars
are
gleaming
high
for
though
thy
form
eludes
my
sight
i
know
thy
gentle
spirit
nigh
o
dear
one
now
i
feel
thy
power
is
sweet
to
rest
when
toil
is
but
sweeter
far
that
blessed
hour
when
fond
hearts
meet
to
part
no
more
chapter
xxvii
adieu
to
the
woods
adieu
adieu
when
quivering
lips
refuse
the
bitter
pangs
of
parting
to
declare
and
the
full
bosom
feels
that
it
must
lose
friends
who
were
wont
its
inmost
thoughts
to
share
when
hands
are
tightly
clasp
struggling
sighs
and
streaming
tears
those
whisper
accents
rise
leaving
to
god
the
objects
of
our
care
in
that
short
simple
comprehensive
prayer
never
did
eager
british
children
look
for
the
first
violets
and
primroses
of
spring
with
more
impatience
than
my
baby
boys
and
girls
watched
day
after
day
for
the
first
that
were
to
form
the
road
to
convey
them
to
their
absent
father
winter
never
means
to
come
this
year
it
will
never
snow
again
exclaimed
my
eldest
boy
turning
from
the
window
on
christmas
day
with
the
most
rueful
aspect
that
ever
greeted
the
broad
gay
beams
of
the
glorious
sun
it
was
like
a
spring
day
the
little
lake
in
front
of
the
window
glittered
like
a
mirror
of
silver
set
in
its
dark
frame
of
pine
woods
i
too
was
wearying
for
the
snow
and
was
tempted
to
think
that
it
did
not
come
as
early
as
usual
in
order
to
disappoint
us
but
i
kept
this
to
myself
and
comforted
the
expecting
child
with
the
assertion
that
it
would
certainly
snow
upon
the
morrow
but
the
morrow
came
and
passed
away
and
many
other
morrows
and
the
same
mild
open
weather
prevailed
the
last
night
of
the
old
year
was
ushered
in
with
furious
storms
of
wind
and
snow
the
rafters
of
our
log
cabin
shook
beneath
the
violence
of
the
gale
which
swept
up
from
the
lake
like
a
lion
roaring
for
its
prey
driving
the
through
every
open
crevice
of
which
there
were
not
a
few
and
powdering
the
floor
until
it
rivalled
in
whiteness
the
ground
without
oh
what
a
dreadful
night
we
cried
as
we
huddled
shivering
around
the
old
broken
stove
a
person
abroad
in
the
woods
would
be
frozen
flesh
and
blood
could
not
long
stand
this
cutting
it
reminds
me
of
the
commencement
of
a
laughable
extempore
ditty
said
i
to
my
young
friend
a
c
who
was
staying
with
me
composed
by
my
husband
during
the
first
very
cold
night
we
spent
in
canada
oh
the
cold
of
canada
nobody
knows
the
fire
burns
our
shoes
without
warming
our
toes
oh
dear
what
shall
we
do
our
blankets
are
thin
and
our
noses
are
blue
our
noses
are
blue
and
our
blankets
are
thin
it
at
zero
without
and
we
freezing
within
chorus
oh
dear
what
shall
we
do
but
joking
apart
my
dear
a
we
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
we
are
not
travelling
this
night
to
b
but
said
my
eldest
boy
lifting
up
his
curly
head
from
my
lap
it
will
be
fine
and
we
shall
see
dear
papa
in
this
hope
he
lay
down
on
his
little
bed
upon
the
floor
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
perhaps
dreaming
of
that
journey
and
of
meeting
his
beloved
father
sleep
was
a
stranger
to
my
eyes
the
tempest
raged
so
furiously
without
that
i
was
fearful
the
roof
would
be
carried
off
the
house
or
that
the
chimney
would
take
fire
the
night
was
far
advanced
when
old
jenny
and
myself
retired
to
bed
my
boy
words
were
prophetic
that
was
the
last
night
i
ever
spent
in
the
bush
in
the
dear
forest
home
which
i
had
loved
in
spite
of
all
the
hardships
which
we
had
endured
since
we
pitched
our
tent
in
the
backwoods
it
was
the
birthplace
of
my
three
boys
the
school
of
high
resolve
and
energetic
action
in
which
we
had
learned
to
meet
calmly
and
successfully
to
battle
with
the
ills
of
life
nor
did
i
leave
it
without
many
regretful
tears
to
mingle
once
more
with
a
world
to
whose
usages
during
my
long
solitude
i
had
become
almost
a
stranger
and
to
whose
praise
or
blame
i
felt
alike
indifferent
when
the
day
dawned
the
whole
forest
scenery
lay
glittering
in
a
mantle
of
dazzling
white
the
sun
shone
brightly
the
heavens
were
intensely
blue
but
the
cold
was
so
severe
that
every
article
of
food
had
to
be
thawed
before
we
could
get
our
breakfast
the
very
blankets
that
covered
us
during
the
night
were
stiff
with
our
frozen
breath
i
hope
the
sleighs
wo
come
i
cried
we
should
be
frozen
on
the
long
about
noon
two
sleighs
turned
into
our
clearing
old
jenny
ran
screaming
into
the
room
the
masther
has
sent
for
us
at
last
the
sleighs
are
come
fine
large
sleighs
and
illigant
teams
of
horses
och
and
its
a
cowld
day
for
the
wee
things
to
lave
the
the
snow
had
been
a
week
in
advance
of
us
at
b
and
my
husband
had
sent
up
the
teams
to
remove
us
the
children
jumped
about
and
laughed
aloud
for
joy
old
jenny
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
but
she
set
about
helping
me
to
pack
up
trunks
and
bedding
as
fast
as
our
cold
hands
would
permit
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
my
brother
arrived
like
a
good
genius
to
our
assistance
declaring
his
determination
to
take
us
down
to
b
himself
in
his
large
this
was
indeed
joyful
news
in
less
than
three
hours
he
despatched
the
hired
sleighs
with
their
loads
and
we
all
stood
together
in
the
empty
house
striving
to
warm
our
hands
over
the
embers
of
the
expiring
fire
how
cold
and
desolate
every
object
appeared
the
small
windows
half
blocked
up
with
snow
scarcely
allowed
a
glimpse
of
the
declining
sun
to
cheer
us
with
his
serene
aspect
in
spite
of
the
cold
several
kind
friends
had
waded
through
the
deep
snow
to
say
god
bless
you
while
a
group
of
silent
indians
stood
together
gazing
upon
our
proceedings
with
an
earnestness
which
showed
that
they
were
not
uninterested
in
the
scene
as
we
passed
out
to
the
sleigh
they
pressed
forward
and
silently
held
out
their
hands
while
the
squaws
kissed
me
and
the
little
ones
with
tearful
eyes
they
had
been
true
friends
to
us
in
our
dire
necessity
and
i
returned
their
mute
farewell
from
my
very
heart
s
sprang
into
the
sleigh
one
of
our
party
was
missing
jenny
shouted
my
brother
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
is
too
cold
to
keep
your
mistress
and
the
little
children
och

it

that
am
comin
returned
the
old
body
as
she
issued
from
the
house
shouts
of
laughter
greeted
her
appearance
the
figure
she
cut
upon
that
memorable
day
i
shall
never
forget
my
brother
dropped
the
reins
upon
the
horses
necks
and
fairly
roared
jenny
was
about
to
commence
her
journey
to
the
front
in
three
hats
was
it
to
protect
her
from
the
cold
oh
no
jenny
was
not
afraid
of
the
cold
she
could
have
eaten
her
breakfast
on
the
north
side
of
an
iceberg
and
always
dispensed
with
shoes
during
the
most
severe
of
our
canadian
winters
it
was
to
protect
these
precious
articles
from
injury
our
good
neighbour
w
had
presented
her
with
an
old
bonnet
as
a
parting
benediction
this
by
way
of
distinction
for
she
never
had
possessed
such
an
article
of
luxury
as
a
silk
bonnet
in
her
life
jenny
had
placed
over
the
coarse
calico
cap
with
its
full
furbelow
of
the
same
yellow
homely
material
next
to
her
head
over
this
as
second
in
degree
a
straw
hat
with
faded
pink
ribbons
just
showed
its
broken
rim
and
tawdry
trimmings
and
to
crown
all
and
serve
as
a
guard
to
the
rest
a
really
serviceable
bonnet
once
mine
towered
up
as
high
as
the
celebrated
crown
in
which
brother
peter
figures
in
swift
tale
of
a
mercy
jenny
why
old
woman
you
do
mean
to
go
with
us
that
figure
och
my
dear
heart
i
no
to
kape
the
cowld
from
desthroying
my
illigant
bonnets
returned
jenny
laying
her
hand
upon
the
side
of
the
sleigh
go
back
jenny
go
back
cried
my
brother
for
god
sake
take
all
that
from
off
your
head
we
shall
be
the
of
every
village
we
pass
och
shure
now
s
who
think
of
looking
at
an
owld
crathur
like
me
it
only
yersel
that
would
notice
the
all
the
world
everybody
would
look
at
you
jenny
i
believe
that
you
put
on
those
hats
to
draw
the
attention
of
all
the
young
fellows
that
we
shall
happen
to
meet
on
the
road
ha
jenny
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
the
old
woman
returned
to
the
house
to
her
toilet
and
provide
for
the
safety
of
her
illigant
bonnets
one
of
which
she
suspended
to
the
strings
of
her
cloak
while
she
carried
the
third
dangling
in
her
hand
and
no
persuasion
of
mine
would
induce
her
to
put
them
out
of
sight
many
painful
and
conflicting
emotions
agitated
my
mind
but
found
no
utterance
in
words
as
we
entered
the
forest
path
and
i
looked
my
last
upon
that
humble
home
consecrated
by
the
memory
of
a
thousand
sorrows
every
object
had
become
endeared
to
me
during
my
long
exile
from
civilised
life
i
loved
the
lonely
lake
with
its
magnificent
belt
of
dark
pines
sighing
in
the
breeze
the
the
summer
home
of
my
dark
indian
friends
my
own
dear
little
garden
with
its
rugged
which
i
had
helped
jenny
to
place
with
my
own
hands
and
which
i
had
assisted
the
faithful
woman
in
cultivating
for
the
last
three
years
where
i
had
so
often
braved
the
tormenting
mosquitoes
black
flies
and
intense
heat
to
provide
vegetables
for
the
use
of
the
family
even
the
cows
that
had
given
a
breakfast
for
the
last
time
to
my
children
were
now
regarded
with
mournful
affection
a
poor
labourer
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
deserted
house
holding
my
noble
rover
in
a
string
the
poor
fellow
gave
a
joyous
bark
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
him
james
j
take
care
of
my
never
fear
he
shall
bide
with
me
as
long
as
he
he
and
the
indians
at
least
feel
grieved
for
our
departure
i
thought
love
is
so
scarce
in
this
world
that
we
ought
to
prize
it
however
lowly
the
source
from
whence
it
flows
we
accomplished
only
twelve
miles
of
our
journey
that
night
the
road
lay
through
the
bush
and
along
the
banks
of
the
grand
rushing
foaming
otonabee
river
the
wildest
and
most
beautiful
of
forest
streams
we
slept
at
the
house
of
kind
friends
and
early
in
the
morning
resumed
our
long
journey
but
minus
one
of
our
party
our
old
favourite
cat
peppermint
had
made
her
escape
from
the
basket
in
which
she
had
been
confined
and
had
scampered
off
to
the
great
grief
of
the
children
as
we
passed
h
house
we
called
for
dear
addie
h
brought
her
in
his
arms
to
the
gate
well
wrapped
up
in
a
large
fur
cape
and
a
warm
woollen
shawl
you
are
robbing
me
of
my
dear
little
girl
he
said
mrs
h
is
absent
she
told
me
not
to
part
with
her
if
you
should
call
but
i
could
not
detain
her
without
your
consent
now
that
you
have
seen
her
allow
me
to
keep
her
for
a
few
months
longer
addie
was
in
the
sleigh
i
put
my
arm
about
her
i
felt
i
had
my
child
again
and
i
secretly
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
my
own
i
sincerely
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
s
drove
on
at
r
we
found
a
parcel
from
dear
emilia
containing
a
and
other
good
things
for
the
children
her
kindness
never
flagged
we
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
otonabee
in
the
rising
town
of
peterborough
at
eight
in
the
morning
winter
had
now
set
in
fairly
the
children
were
glad
to
huddle
together
in
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
under
the
buffalo
skins
and
blankets
all
but
my
eldest
boy
who
just
turned
of
five
years
old
was
enchanted
with
all
he
heard
and
saw
and
continued
to
stand
up
and
gaze
around
him
born
in
the
forest
which
he
had
never
quitted
before
the
sight
of
a
town
was
such
a
novelty
that
he
could
find
no
words
wherewith
to
express
his
astonishment
are
the
houses
come
to
see
one
another
he
asked
how
did
they
all
meet
here
the
question
greatly
amused
his
uncle
who
took
some
pains
to
explain
to
him
the
difference
between
town
and
country
during
the
day
we
got
rid
of
old
jenny
and
her
bonnets
whom
we
found
a
very
refractory
travelling
companion
as
wilful
and
far
more
difficult
to
manage
than
a
young
child
fortunately
we
overtook
the
sleighs
with
the
furniture
and
s
transferred
jenny
to
the
care
of
one
of
the
drivers
an
arrangement
that
proved
satisfactory
to
all
parties
we
had
been
most
fortunate
in
obtaining
comfortable
lodgings
for
the
night
the
evening
had
closed
in
so
intensely
cold
that
although
we
were
only
two
miles
from
c
addie
was
so
much
affected
by
it
that
the
child
lay
sick
and
pale
in
my
arms
and
when
spoken
to
seemed
scarcely
conscious
of
our
presence
my
brother
jumped
from
the
front
seat
and
came
round
to
look
at
her
that
child
is
ill
with
the
cold
we
must
stop
somewhere
to
warm
her
or
she
will
hardly
hold
out
till
we
get
to
the
inn
at
c
we
were
just
entering
the
little
village
of
a
in
the
vicinity
of
the
and
we
stopped
at
a
pretty
green
cottage
and
asked
permission
to
warm
the
children
a
stout
woman
came
to
the
sleigh
and
in
the
kindest
manner
requested
us
to
alight
i
think
i
know
that
voice
i
said
surely
it
can
not
be
s
who
once
kept
the
hotel
at
c
mrs
moodie
you
are
welcome
said
the
excellent
woman
bestowing
upon
me
a
most
friendly
embrace
you
and
your
children
i
am
heartily
glad
to
see
you
again
after
so
many
years
god
bless
you
all
nothing
could
exceed
the
kindness
and
hospitality
of
this
generous
woman
she
would
not
hear
of
our
leaving
her
that
night
and
directing
my
brother
to
put
up
his
horses
in
her
stable
she
made
up
an
excellent
fire
in
a
large
bedroom
and
helped
me
to
undress
the
little
ones
who
were
already
asleep
and
to
warm
and
feed
the
rest
before
we
put
them
to
bed
this
meeting
gave
me
real
pleasure
in
their
station
of
life
i
seldom
have
found
a
more
worthy
couple
than
this
american
and
his
wife
and
having
witnessed
so
many
of
their
acts
of
kindness
both
to
ourselves
and
others
i
entertained
for
them
a
sincere
respect
and
affection
and
truly
rejoiced
that
providence
had
once
more
led
me
to
the
shelter
of
their
roof
s
was
absent
but
i
found
little
mary
the
sweet
child
who
used
to
listen
with
such
delight
to
moodie
flute
grown
up
into
a
beautiful
girl
and
the
baby
that
was
a
fine
child
of
eight
years
old
the
next
morning
was
so
intensely
cold
that
my
brother
would
not
resume
the
journey
until
past
ten
and
even
then
it
was
a
hazardous
experiment
we
had
not
proceeded
four
miles
before
the
horses
were
covered
with
icicles
our
hair
was
frozen
as
white
as
old
time
solitary
forelock
our
eyelids
stiff
and
every
limb
aching
with
cold
this
will
never
do
said
my
brother
turning
to
me
the
children
will
freeze
i
never
felt
the
cold
more
severe
than
where
can
we
stop
said
i
we
are
miles
from
c
and
i
see
no
prospect
of
the
weather
becoming
yes
yes
i
know
by
the
very
intensity
of
the
cold
that
a
change
is
at
hand
we
seldom
have
more
than
three
very
severe
days
running
and
this
is
the
third
at
all
events
it
is
much
warmer
at
night
in
this
country
than
during
the
day
the
wind
drops
and
the
frost
is
more
bearable
i
know
a
worthy
farmer
who
lives
about
a
mile
ahead
he
will
give
us
for
a
few
hours
and
we
will
resume
our
journey
in
the
evening
the
moon
is
at
full
and
it
will
be
easier
to
wrap
the
children
up
and
keep
them
warm
when
they
are
asleep
shall
we
stop
at
old
woodruff
with
all
my
my
teeth
were
chattering
with
the
cold
and
the
children
were
crying
over
their
aching
fingers
at
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
a
few
minutes
ride
brought
us
to
a
large
surrounded
by
commodious
sheds
and
barns
a
fine
orchard
opposite
and
a
yard
with
fat
cattle
and
sheep
sleek
geese
and
swine
gave
promise
of
a
land
of
abundance
and
comfort
my
brother
ran
into
the
house
to
see
if
the
owner
was
at
home
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
the
staunch
canadian
yeoman
and
his
daughter
who
gave
us
a
truly
hearty
welcome
and
assisted
in
removing
the
children
from
the
sleigh
to
the
cheerful
fire
that
made
all
bright
and
cozy
within
our
host
was
a
shrewd
yorkshireman
his
red
face
and
tall
athletic
figure
bent
as
it
was
with
hard
labour
gave
indications
of
great
personal
strength
and
a
certain
knowing
twinkle
in
his
small
clear
grey
eyes
which
had
been
acquired
by
long
dealing
with
the
world
with
a
quiet
sarcastic
smile
that
lurked
round
the
corners
of
his
large
mouth
gave
you
the
idea
of
a
man
who
could
not
easily
be
deceived
by
his
fellows
one
who
though
no
rogue
himself
was
quick
in
detecting
the
roguery
of
others
his
manners
were
frank
and
easy
and
he
was
such
a
hospitable
entertainer
that
you
felt
at
home
with
him
in
a
minute
well
how
are
you
s
cried
the
farmer
shaking
my
brother
heartily
by
the
hand
toiling
in
the
bush
still
eh
just
in
the
same
and
the
wife
and
children
hearty
some
have
been
added
to
the
flock
since
you
were
our
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
the
more
the
merrier
s
children
are
riches
in
this
i
know
not
how
that
may
be
i
find
it
hard
to
clothe
and
feed
wait
till
they
grow
up
they
will
be
brave
helps
to
you
then
the
price
of
labour
the
price
of
labour
s
is
the
destruction
of
the
it
does
not
seem
to
trouble
you
much
woodruff
said
my
brother
glancing
round
the
apartment
my
son
and
s
do
it
all
cried
the
old
man
of
course
the
girls
help
in
busy
times
and
take
care
of
the
dairy
and
we
hire
occasionally
but
small
as
the
sum
is
which
is
expended
in
wages
during
and
harvest
i
feel
it
i
can
tell
you
are
married
again
woodruff
no
sir
said
the
farmer
with
a
peculiar
smile
not
yet
which
seemed
to
imply
the
probability
of
such
an
event
that
tall
gal
is
my
eldest
daughter
she
manages
the
house
and
an
excellent
housekeeper
she
is
but
i
can
not
keep
her
for
with
a
knowing
wink
gals
will
think
of
getting
married
and
seldom
consult
the
wishes
of
their
parents
upon
the
subject
when
once
they
have
taken
the
notion
into
their
heads
but
is
natural
s
it
is
natural
we
did
just
the
same
when
we
were
my
brother
looked
laughingly
towards
the
fine
handsome
young
woman
as
she
placed
upon
the
table
hot
water
whiskey
and
a
huge
plate
of
which
did
not
lack
a
companion
stored
with
the
finest
apples
which
the
orchard
could
produce
the
young
girl
looked
down
and
blushed
oh
i
see
how
it
is
woodruff
you
will
soon
lose
your
daughter
i
wonder
that
you
have
kept
her
so
long
but
who
are
these
young
ladies
he
continued
as
three
girls
very
demurely
entered
the
room
the
two
youngest
are
my
darters
by
my
last
wife
who
i
fear
mean
soon
to
follow
the
bad
example
of
their
sister
the
other
said
the
old
man
with
a
reverential
air
is
a
friend
of
my
eldest
my
brother
laughed
slily
and
the
old
man
cheek
took
a
deeper
glow
as
he
stooped
forward
to
mix
the
punch
you
said
that
these
two
young
ladies
woodruff
were
by
your
last
wife
pray
how
many
wives
have
you
had
only
three
it
is
impossible
they
say
in
my
country
to
have
too
much
of
a
good
so
i
suppose
you
think
said
my
brother
glancing
first
at
the
old
man
and
then
towards
miss
smith
three
wives
you
have
been
a
fortunate
man
woodruff
to
survive
them
ay
have
i
not
s
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
been
both
lucky
and
unlucky
in
the
wife
way
and
then
he
told
us
the
history
of
his
several
ventures
in
matrimony
with
which
i
shall
not
trouble
my
readers
when
he
had
concluded
the
weather
was
somewhat
milder
the
sleigh
was
ordered
to
the
door
and
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
resting
for
the
night
at
a
small
village
about
twenty
miles
from
b
rejoicing
that
the
long
distance
which
separated
us
from
the
husband
and
father
was
diminished
to
a
few
miles
and
that
with
the
blessing
of
providence
we
should
meet
on
the
morrow
about
noon
we
reached
the
distant
town
and
were
met
at
the
inn
by
him
whom
one
and
all
so
ardently
longed
to
see
he
conducted
us
to
a
pretty
neat
cottage
which
he
had
prepared
for
our
reception
and
where
we
found
old
jenny
already
arrived
with
great
pride
the
old
woman
conducted
me
over
the
premises
and
showed
me
the
furniture
the
masther
had
bought
especially
recommending
to
my
notice
a
china
which
she
considered
the
most
wonderful
acquisition
of
the
whole
och
who
would
have
thought
a
year
ago
misthress
dear
that
we
should
be
living
in
a
mansion
like
this
and
ating
off
raal
chaney
it
is
but
yestherday
that
we
were
hoeing
praties
in
the
yes
jenny
god
has
been
very
good
to
us
and
i
hope
that
we
shall
never
learn
to
regard
with
indifference
the
many
benefits
which
we
have
received
at
his
reader
it
is
not
my
intention
to
trouble
you
with
the
sequel
of
our
history
i
have
given
you
a
faithful
picture
of
a
life
in
the
backwoods
of
canada
and
i
leave
you
to
draw
from
it
your
own
conclusions
to
the
poor
industrious
working
man
it
presents
many
advantages
to
the
poor
gentleman
none
the
former
works
hard
puts
up
with
coarse
scanty

the

cleared
finds
him
in

necessaries
of
life

it
seldom

ever

the

unaccustomed

canadian
sketches
the
preceding
sketches
of
canadian
life
as
the
reader
may
well
suppose
are
necessarily
tinctured
with
somewhat
somber
hues
imparted
by
the
difficulties
and
privations
with
which
for
so
many
years
the
writer
had
to
struggle
but
we
should
be
sorry
should
these
truthful
pictures
of
scenes
and
characters
observed
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
have
the
effect
of
conveying
erroneous
impressions
of
the
present
state
of
a
country
which
is
manifestly
destined
at
no
remote
period
to
be
one
of
the
most
prosperous
in
the
world
had
we
merely
desired
to
please
the
imagination
of
our
readers
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
painted
the
country
and
the
people
rather
as
we
could
have
wished
them
to
be
than
as
they
actually
were
at
the
period
to
which
our
description
refers
and
probably
what
is
thus
lost
in
truthfulness
it
would
have
gained
in
popularity
with
that
class
of
readers
who
peruse
books
more
for
amusement
than
instruction
when
i
say
that
canada
is
destined
to
be
one
of
the
most
prosperous
countries
in
the
world
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
i
am
influenced
by
any
unreasonable
partiality
for
the
land
of
my
adoption
canada
may
not
possess
mines
of
gold
or
silver
but
she
possesses
all
those
advantages
of
climate
geological
structure
and
position
which
are
essential
to
greatness
and
prosperity
her
long
and
severe
winter
so
disheartening
to
her
first
settlers
lays
up
amidst
the
forests
of
the
west
inexhaustible
supplies
of
fertilising
moisture
for
the
summer
while
it
affords
the
farmer
the
very
best
of
natural
roads
to
enable
him
to
carry
his
wheat
and
other
produce
to
market
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
hardly
a
lot
of
land
containing
two
hundred
acres
in
british
america
can
be
found
without
an
abundant
supply
of
water
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
land
itself
is
naturally
unfit
for
cultivation
to
crown
the
whole
where
can
a
country
be
pointed
out
which
possesses
such
an
extent
of
internal
navigation
a
chain
of
river
navigation
and
navigable
inland
seas
which
with
the
canals
recently
constructed
gives
to
the
countries
bordering
on
them
all
the
advantages
of
an
extended
with
a
greatly
diminished
risk
of
loss
from
shipwreck
little
did
the
modern
discoverers
of
america
dream
when
they
called
this
country
canada
from
the
exclamation
of
one
of
the
exploring
party
aca
nada
there
is
nothing
here
as
the
story
goes
that
canada
would
far
outstrip
those
lands
of
gold
and
silver
in
which
their
imaginations
revelled
in
that
real
wealth
of
which
gold
and
silver
are
but
the
portable
representatives
the
interminable
forests
that
most
gloomy
and
forbidding
feature
in
its
scenery
to
the
european
stranger
should
have
been
regarded
as
the
most
certain
proof
of
its
fertility
the
severity
of
the
climate
and
the
incessant
toil
of
clearing
the
land
to
enable
the
first
settlers
to
procure
the
mere
necessaries
of
life
have
formed
in
its
present
inhabitants
an
indomitable
energy
of
character
which
whatever
may
be
their
faults
must
be
regarded
as
a
distinguishing
attribute
of
the
canadians
in
common
with
our
neighbours
of
the
united
states
when
we
consider
the
progress
of
the
northern
races
of
mankind
it
can
not
be
denied
that
while
the
struggles
of
the
hardy
races
of
the
north
with
their
severe
climate
and
their
forests
have
gradually
endowed
them
with
an
unconquerable
energy
of
character
which
has
enabled
them
to
become
the
masters
of
the
world
the
inhabitants
of
more
favoured
climates
where
the
earth
almost
spontaneously
yields
all
the
necessaries
of
life
have
remained
comparatively
feeble
and
inactive
or
have
sunk
into
sloth
and
luxury
it
is
unnecessary
to
quote
any
other
instances
in
proof
of
this
obvious
fact
than
the
progress
of
great
britain
and
the
united
states
of
america
which
have
conquered
as
much
by
their
industry
as
by
their
swords
our
neighbours
of
the
united
states
are
in
the
habit
of
attributing
their
wonderful
progress
in
improvements
of
all
kinds
to
their
republican
institutions
this
is
no
doubt
quite
natural
in
a
people
who
have
done
so
much
for
themselves
in
so
short
a
time
but
when
we
consider
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
it
may
be
more
truly
asserted
that
with
any
form
of
government
not
absolutely
despotic
the
progress
of
north
america
peopled
by
a
civilised
and
energetic
race
with
every
motive
to
industry
and
enterprise
in
the
nature
of
the
country
itself
must
necessarily
have
been
rapid
an
unbounded
extent
of
fertile
soil
with
an
increasing
population
were
circumstances
which
of
themselves
were
sufficient
to
create
a
strong
desire
for
the
improvement
of
internal
communications
as
without
common
roads
or
canals
the
interior
of
the
country
would
have
been
unfit
to
be
inhabited
by
any
but
absolute
barbarians
all
the
first
settlers
of
america
wanted
was
to
be
left
to
themselves
when
we
compare
the
progress
of
great
britain
with
that
of
north
america
the
contrast
is
sufficiently
striking
to
attract
our
attention
while
the
progress
of
the
former
has
been
the
work
of
ages
north
america
has
sprung
into
wealth
and
power
almost
within
a
period
which
we
can
remember
but
the
colonists
of
north
america
should
recollect
when
they
indulge
in
such
comparisons
that
their
british
ancestors
took
many
centuries
to
civilise
themselves
before
they
could
send
free
and
intelligent
settlers
to
america
the
necessity
for
improvements
in
the
internal
communications
is
vastly
more
urgent
in
a
widely
extended
continent
than
in
an
island
no
part
of
which
is
far
removed
from
the
and
patriotism
as
well
as
would
readily
suggest
such
improvements
to
the
minds
of
a
people
who
inherited
the
knowledge
of
their
ancestors
and
were
besides
stimulated
to
extraordinary
exertions
by
their
independence
as
the
political
existence
of
the
united
states
commenced
at
a
period
when
civilisation
had
made
great
progress
in
the
their
subsequent
improvement
would
for
various
reasons
be
much
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
country
from
which
they
originally
emigrated
to
show
the
influence
of
external
circumstances
on
the
characters
of
men
let
us
just
suppose
two
individuals
equal
in
knowledge
and
natural
capacity
to
be
placed
the
one
on
an
improved
farm
in
england
with
the
necessary
capital
and
and
the
other
in
the
wilds
of
america
with
no
capital
but
his
labour
and
the
implements
required
to
clear
the
land
for
his
future
farm
in
which
of
these
individuals
might
we
reasonably
expect
to
find
the
most
energy
ingenuity
and
general
intelligence
on
subjects
connected
with
their
immediate
interests
no
one
who
has
lived
for
a
few
years
in
the
united
states
or
canada
can
hesitate
for
a
reply
the
farmer
in
the
more
improved
country
generally
follows
the
beaten
track
the
example
of
his
ancestors
or
the
successful
one
of
his
more
intelligent
contemporaries
he
is
rarely
compelled
to
draw
upon
his
individual
mental
resources
not
so
with
the
colonist
he
treads
in
tracks
but
little
known
he
has
to
struggle
with
difficulties
on
all
sides
nature
looks
sternly
on
him
and
in
order
to
preserve
his
own
existence
he
must
conquer
nature
as
it
were
by
his
perseverance
and
ingenuity
each
fresh
conquest
tends
to
increase
his
vigour
and
intelligence
until
he
becomes
a
new
man
with
faculties
of
mind
which
but
for
his
severe
lessons
in
the
school
of
adversity
might
have
lain
for
ever
dormant
while
america
presents
the
most
forbidden
aspect
to
the
new
settler
it
at
the
same
time
offers
the
richest
rewards
to
stimulate
his
industry
on
the
one
hand
there
is
want
and
misery
on
the
other
abundance
and
prosperity
there
is
no
middle
course
for
the
settler
he
must
work
or
starve
in
north
america
there
is
another
strong
incentive
to
improvement
to
be
found
in
the
scarcity
of
labour
and
still
more
therefore
than
in
europe
must
every
mechanical
contrivance
which
supersedes
manual
labour
tend
to
increase
the
prosperity
of
the
inhabitants
when
these
circumstances
are
duly
considered
we
need
no
longer
wonder
at
the
rapid
improvements
in
machinery
and
in
the
means
of
internal
communication
throughout
the
united
states
but
for
the
canals
and
railroads
north
america
would
have
remained
for
ages
a
howling
wilderness
of
endless
forests
and
instead
of
the
busy
hum
of
men
and
the
sound
of
the
mill
and
we
should
now
have
heard
nothing
but
the
melancholy
roar
of
unfrequented
the
scenes
and
characters
presented
to
the
reader
in
the
preceding
pages
belong
in
some
measure
rather
to
the
past
than
the
present
state
of
canada
in
the
last
twenty
years
great
changes
have
taken
place
as
well
in
the
external
appearance
of
the
country
as
in
the
general
character
of
its
inhabitants
in
many
localities
where
the
land
was
already
under
the
plough
the
original
occupants
of
the
soil
have
departed
to
renew
their
endless
wars
with
the
giants
of
the
forest
in
order
to
procure
more
land
for
their
increasing
families
where
it
could
be
obtained
at
a
cheaper
price
in
the
forests
have
been
felled
the
blackened
stumps
have
disappeared
and
regular
furrows
are
formed
by
the
ploughman
where
formerly
he
had
not
time
or
inclination
to
whistle
at
his
work
a
superior
class
of
farmers
has
sprung
up
whose
minds
are
as
much
improved
by
cultivation
as
their
lands
and
who
are
comfortably
settled
on
farms
supposed
to
be
exhausted
of
their
fertility
by
their
predecessors
as
the
breadth
of
land
recovered
from
the
forest
is
increased
villages
towns
and
cities
have
grown
up
and
increased
in
population
and
wealth
in
proportion
to
the
productiveness
of
the
surrounding
country
in
canada
it
is
particularly
to
be
noted
that
there
is
hardly
any
intermediate
stage
between
the
rude
toil
and
privation
of
the
and
the
civilisation
comfort
and
luxury
of
the
towns
and
cities
many
of
which
are
to
outward
appearance
entirely
european
with
the
encouraging
prospect
of
a
continual
increase
in
the
value
of
fixed
property
when
a
colony
capable
from
the
fertility
of
the
soil
and
abundance
of
moisture
of
supporting
a
dense
population
has
been
settled
by
a
civilised
race
they
are
never
long
in
establishing
a
communication
with
the
and
with
other
countries
when
such
improvements
have
been
effected
the
inhabitants
may
be
said
at
once
to
take
their
proper
place
among
civilised
nations
the
elements
of
wealth
and
power
are
already
there
and
time
and
population
only
are
required
fully
to
develope
the
resources
of
the
country
unhappily
the
natural
progress
of
civilised
communities
in
our
colonies
is
too
often
obstructed
by
the
ignorance
of
governments
and
unwise
or
legislation
and
abundance
of
selfish
men
are
always
to
be
found
in
the
colonies
themselves
who
destitute
of
patriotism
greedily
avail
themselves
of
this
ignorance
in
order
to
promote
their
private
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
community
canada
has
been
greatly
retarded
in
its
progress
by
such
causes
and
this
will
in
a
great
measure
account
for
its
backwardness
when
compared
with
the
united
states
without
attributing
the
difference
to
the
different
forms
of
government
it
was
manifestly
the
intention
of
the
british
government
in
conferring
representative
institutions
on
canada
that
the
people
should
enjoy
all
the
privileges
of
their
in
the
the
more
to
assimilate
our
government
to
that
of
its
great
original
the
idea
was
for
some
time
entertained
of
creating
a
titled
and
hereditary
aristocracy
but
it
was
soon
found
that
though
the
king
can
make
a
belted
knight
a
marquis
duke
an
a
that
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
give
permanency
to
an
institution
which
in
its
origin
was
as
independent
as
royalty
itself
arising
naturally
out
of
the
feudal
system
but
which
was
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
genius
and
circumstances
of
a
modern
colony
the
sovereign
might
endow
the
members
of
such
an
aristocracy
with
grants
of
the
lands
of
the
crown
to
support
their
dignity
but
what
benefit
could
such
grants
be
even
to
the
recipients
in
a
country
covered
with
boundless
forests
and
nearly
destitute
of
inhabitants
it
is
obvious
that
no
tenants
could
be
found
to
pay
rents
for
such
lands
or
indeed
even
to
occupy
them
while
lands
could
be
purchased
on
easy
terms
in
the
united
states
or
in
canada
itself
had
this
plan
been
carried
out
canada
would
have
been
a
doomed
country
for
centuries
the
strongest
incitements
to
industry
are
required
those
of
proprietorship
and
ultimate
independence
to
induce
settlers
to
encounter
all
the
privations
and
toil
of
a
new
settlement
in
such
a
country
a
genuine
aristocracy
can
only
exist
in
a
country
already
peopled
and
which
has
been
conquered
and
divided
among
the
conquerors
in
such
a
state
of
things
aristocracy
though
artificial
in
its
origin
becomes
naturalised
if
i
may
use
the
expression
and
even
as
in
great
britain
when
restrained
within
proper
limits
highly
beneficial
in
advancing
civilization
be
it
for
good
or
be
it
for
evil
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
government
of
a
modern
colony
where
every
conquest
is
made
from
the
forest
by
little
at
a
time
must
be
essentially
republican
any
allusion
to
political
parties
is
certainly
foreign
to
the
object
of
the
preceding
sketches
but
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
british
reader
acquainted
with
the
various
circumstances
which
retarded
the
progress
of
this
fine
colony
without
explaining
how
the
patronage
of
the
local
government
came
formerly
to
be
so
exclusively
bestowed
on
one
class
of
the
population
thus
creating
a
kind
of
spurious
aristocracy
which
disgusted
the
colonists
and
drove
emigration
from
our
shores
to
those
of
the
united
states
after
the
american
revolution
considerable
numbers
of
loyalists
in
the
united
states
voluntarily
relinquished
their
homesteads
and
property
and
came
to
canada
which
then
even
on
the
shores
of
lake
ontario
was
a
perfect
wilderness
lands
were
of
course
granted
to
them
by
the
government
and
very
naturally
these
settlers
were
peculiarly
favoured
by
the
local
authorities
these
loyalists
were
generally
known
by
the
name
of
tories
to
distinguish
them
from
the
republicans
and
forming
the
great
mass
of
the
population
any
one
who
called
himself
a
reformer
was
regarded
with
distrust
and
suspicion
as
a
concealed
republican
or
rebel
it
must
not
however
be
supposed
that
these
loyalists
were
really
tories
in
their
political
principles
their
notions
on
such
subjects
were
generally
crude
and
undefined
and
living
in
a
country
where
the
whole
construction
of
society
and
habits
of
feeling
were
decidedly
republican
the
term
tory
when
adopted
by
them
was
certainly
a
misnomer
however
hated
by
and
hating
as
cordially
the
republican
party
in
the
united
states
they
by
no
means
unreasonably
considered
that
their
losses
and
their
attachment
to
british
institutions
gave
them
an
almost
exclusive
claim
to
the
favour
of
the
local
government
in
canada
thus
the
name
of
united
empire
loyalist
or
tory
came
to
be
considered
an
indispensable
qualification
for
every
office
in
the
colony
this
was
all
well
enough
so
long
as
there
was
no
other
party
in
the
country
but
gradually
a
number
of
other
american
settlers
flowed
into
canada
from
the
united
states
who
had
no
claim
to
the
title
of
tories
or
loyalists
but
who
in
their
feelings
and
habits
were
probably
not
much
more
republican
than
their
predecessors
these
were
of
course
regarded
with
peculiar
jealousy
by
the
older
or
loyalist
settlers
from
the
same
country
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
a
swarm
of
locusts
had
come
to
devour
their
patrimony
this
will
account
for
the
violence
of
party
feeling
which
lately
prevailed
in
canada
there
is
nothing
like
a
slight
infusion
of
to
give
point
and
pungency
to
party
feeling
the
british
immigrants
who
afterwards
flowed
into
this
colony
in
greater
numbers
of
course
brought
with
them
their
own
particular
political
predilections
they
found
what
was
called
toryism
and
high
churchism
in
the
ascendant
and
or
prejudice
induced
most
of
the
more
early
settlers
of
this
description
to
fall
in
with
the
more
powerful
and
favoured
party
while
influenced
by
the
representations
of
the
old
loyalist
party
they
shunned
the
other
american
settlers
as
republicans
in
the
meantime
however
the
descendants
of
the
original
loyalists
were
becoming
numerous
while
the
government
became
unable
to
satisfy
them
all
according
to
their
own
estimation
of
their
merits
and
as
high
churchism
was
unfortunately
for
the
peace
of
society
associated
with
toryism
every
shade
of
religious
dissent
as
well
as
political
difference
of
opinion
generally
added
to
the
numbers
and
power
of
the
reform
party
which
was
now
beginning
to
be
known
in
the
colony
strange
to
say
the
great
bulk
of
the
present
reform
party
is
composed
of
the
descendants
of
these
loyalists
while
many
of
our
most
ultra
tories
are
the
descendants
of
republican
settlers
from
the
united
states
as
may
be
supposed
thirty
years
of
increasing
emigration
from
the
has
greatly
strengthened
the
reform
party
and
they
now
considerably
the
conservatives
while
the
mass
of
the
people
held
tory
or
i
should
rather
call
them
principles
our
government
seemed
to
work
as
well
as
any
representative
government
may
be
supposed
to
work
without
the
necessary
check
of
a
constitutional
opposition
favouritism
was
of
course
the
order
of
the
day
and
the
governor
for
the
time
being
filled
up
all
offices
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
without
many
objections
being
made
by
the
people
as
to
the
qualifications
of
the
favourite
parties
provided
the
selections
for
office
were
made
from
the
powerful
party
large
grants
of
land
were
given
to
favoured
individuals
in
the
colony
or
to
immigrants
who
came
with
commendations
from
the
home
government
in
such
a
state
of
matters
the
people
certainly
possessed
the
external
form
of
a
free
government
but
as
an
opposition
party
gradually
acquired
an
ascendancy
in
the
lower
house
of
parliament
they
were
unable
to
carry
the
measures
adopted
by
their
majority
into
operation
in
consequence
of
the
systematic
opposition
of
the
legislative
and
executive
councils
which
were
generally
formed
exclusively
from
the
old
conservative
party
whenever
the
conservatives
obtained
the
majority
in
the
house
of
assembly
the
reformers
in
retaliation
as
systematically
opposed
every
measure
thus
a
constant
bickering
was
kept
up
between
the
parties
in
parliament
while
the
people
amidst
these
attentions
lost
sight
of
the
true
interests
of
the
country
and
improvements
of
all
kinds
came
nearly
to
a
as
matters
were
then
conducted
it
would
have
been
much
better
had
the
colony
been
ruled
by
a
governor
and
council
for
in
that
case
beneficial
measures
might
have
been
carried
into
effect
such
a
state
of
things
could
not
last
long
and
the
discontent
of
a
large
portion
of
the
people
terminating
through
the
indiscretion
of
an
infatuated
local
government
in
actual
rebellion
soon
produced
the
remedy
the
party
generally
most
powerful
in
the
legislative
assembly
and
the
members
of
which
had
been
so
long
and
so
unconstitutionally
excluded
from
holding
offices
under
the
government
at
once
obtained
the
position
which
they
were
entitled
and
the
people
being
thus
given
the
power
of
governing
by
their
majorities
in
parliament
improvements
of
all
kinds
are
steadily
advancing
up
the
present
moment
and
their
prosperity
and
contentment
have
increased
in
an
equal
proportion
had
the
first
settlement
of
canada
been
conducted
on
sound
and
philosophical
principles
much
hardship
and
privation
as
well
as
loss
of
capital
in
land
speculations
would
have
been
saved
to
its
first
settlers
and
the
country
improved
and
improving
as
it
now
is
would
have
presented
a
very
different
aspect
at
the
present
time
with
the
best
intentions
the
british
government
may
be
justly
accused
of
gross
ignorance
of
the
true
principles
of
colonisation
and
the
local
governments
are
still
more
open
to
the
accusation
of
squandering
the
resources
of
the
colony
its
lands
in
building
up
the
fortunes
of
a
aristocracy
who
being
proprietors
of
wild
lands
necessarily
obstructed
the
progress
of
improvement
while
the
people
were
tantalised
with
the
empty
semblance
of
a
free
government
no
sooner
did
emigrants
from
great
britain
begin
to
pour
into
upper
canada
so
as
to
afford
a
prospect
of
the
wild
lands
becoming
saleable
than
a
system
of
land
speculation
was
resorted
to
by
many
of
the
old
colonists
this
land
speculation
has
no
doubt
enriched
many
individuals
but
more
than
any
other
abuse
has
it
retarded
the
natural
progress
of
the
country
and
the
interests
of
the
many
have
thus
been
sacrificed
to
those
of
the
few
almost
all
other
speculations
may
be
said
in
one
shape
or
another
to
do
good
but
land
speculation
has
been
an
unmitigated
curse
to
canada
because
it
occasions
a
monopoly
of
the
soil
and
prevents
it
from
being
cleared
and
rendered
productive
until
the
speculators
can
obtain
their
own
price
for
it
the
lands
granted
to
soldiers
and
sailors
who
had
served
in
canada
and
those
granted
to
the
loyalists
were
bought
up
often
at
merely
nominal
prices
from
the
original
grantees
and
their
children
and
sold
again
with
an
immense
profit
to
new
settlers
from
the
old
country
or
retained
for
many
years
in
an
unproductive
state
a
portion
of
the
lands
granted
to
the
loyalists
was
of
course
occupied
by
the
heads
of
families
but
the
lands
to
which
their
children
became
entitled
under
the
same
benevolent
provision
of
the
government
were
generally
drawn
in
remote
situations
by
far
the
larger
portion
of
these
grants
however
were
not
located
or
rendered
available
by
the
grantees
but
remained
in
the
shape
of
rights
which
were
purchased
at
very
low
prices
by
the
speculators
these
rights
were
bought
at
the
rate
of
or
per
acre
and
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
old
soldiers
to
sell
one
hundred
acres
of
land
for
two
or
three
dollars
or
even
for
a
bottle
of
rum
so
little
value
did
they
set
on
such
grants
in
the
then
state
of
canada
these
grants
though
well
meant
and
with
respect
to
the
loyalists
perhaps
unavoidable
have
been
most
injurious
to
the
country
the
great
error
in
this
matter
and
which
could
have
been
avoided
was
the
opening
of
too
great
an
extent
of
land
for
settlement
a
contrary
system
steadily
pursued
would
have
produced
a
concentrated
population
and
the
resources
of
such
a
population
would
have
enabled
the
colonists
by
uniting
their
labour
and
capital
to
make
the
means
of
communication
in
some
degree
keep
pace
with
the
settlement
of
the
lands
and
upper
canada
would
now
have
been
as
well
provided
with
canals
and
railroads
as
the
united
states
the
same
abuses
no
doubt
existed
formerly
to
as
great
an
extent
in
that
country
but
being
longer
settled
it
has
outgrown
the
evil
enough
has
been
said
on
this
subject
to
show
some
of
the
causes
which
have
retarded
improvements
in
canada
another
chief
cause
of
the
long
and
helpless
torpor
in
which
the
country
lay
was
the
absence
of
municipal
governments
in
the
various
rural
localities
it
indeed
seems
strange
that
such
a
simple
matter
as
providing
the
means
of
making
roads
and
bridges
by
local
assessment
could
not
have
been
conceded
to
the
people
who
if
we
suppose
them
to
be
gifted
with
common
sense
are
much
more
capable
of
understanding
and
managing
their
own
parish
business
than
any
government
however
well
disposed
to
promote
their
interests
formerly
the
government
of
upper
canada
was
deluged
with
petitions
for
grants
of
money
from
parliament
to
be
expended
in
improvements
in
this
or
that
locality
of
the
reasonableness
of
which
claims
the
majority
of
the
legislators
were
of
course
profoundly
ignorant
these
money
grants
became
subjects
of
a
species
of
jobbing
or
manoeuvering
among
the
members
of
the
house
of
assembly
and
he
was
considered
the
best
member
who
could
get
the
most
money
for
his
county
commissioners
resident
in
the
particular
localities
were
appointed
to
superintend
these
public
works
and
as
these
commissioners
were
generally
destitute
of
practical
knowledge
these
parliamentary
grants
were
usually
expended
without
producing
equivalent
results
nothing
in
the
abstract
is
more
reasonable
than
that
any
number
of
individuals
should
be
allowed
to
associate
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
some
local
improvement
which
would
be
beneficial
to
others
as
well
as
to
themselves
but
nothing
of
this
could
be
attempted
without
an
act
of
parliament
which
of
course
was
attended
with
expense
and
delay
if
not
disappointment
the
time
and
attention
of
the
provincial
parliament
were
thus
occupied
with
a
mass
of
parish
business
which
could
have
been
much
better
managed
by
the
people
themselves
on
the
spot
when
the
union
of
the
two
provinces
was
in
contemplation
it
became
evident
that
the
business
of
such
an
extended
colony
could
not
be
carried
on
in
the
united
parliament
were
it
to
be
encumbered
and
distracted
with
the
contending
claims
of
so
many
localities
this
consideration
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
district
now
county
municipal
councils
these
municipal
councils
were
denounced
by
the
conservative
party
at
the
time
as
a
step
towards
republicanism
were
this
true
it
would
only
prove
that
the
government
of
our
republican
neighbours
is
better
than
our
own
for
these
municipal
institutions
have
been
eminently
beneficial
to
canada
but
municipal
councils
are
necessarily
no
more
republican
in
their
nature
than
the
house
of
commons
in
england
however
this
may
be
the
true
prosperity
of
upper
canada
may
be
mainly
attributed
to
their
influence
on
the
minds
of
the
people
possessing
many
of
the
external
forms
of
a
parliament
they
are
admirable
political
schools
for
a
free
people
the
most
intelligent
men
in
the
different
townships
are
freely
elected
by
the
inhabitants
and
assemble
in
the
county
town
to
deliberate
and
make
to
levy
taxes
and
in
short
to
do
everything
which
in
their
judgment
will
promote
the
interest
of
their
constituents
having
previously
been
solely
occupied
in
agricultural
pursuits
it
might
naturally
be
expected
that
their
first
notions
would
be
somewhat
crude
and
that
they
would
have
many
prejudices
to
overcome
their
daily
intercourse
with
the
more
educated
inhabitants
of
the
towns
however
tended
to
remove
these
prejudices
while
new
ideas
were
continually
presented
to
their
minds
the
rapidity
with
which
this
species
of
practical
education
is
acquired
is
remarkable
and
also
how
soon
men
with
such
limited
opportunities
of
acquiring
knowledge
learn
to
think
and
to
express
their
views
and
opinions
in
appropriate
language
these
municipal
councillors
go
home
among
their
constituents
where
they
have
to
explain
and
defend
their
proceedings
while
so
engaged
they
have
occasion
to
communicate
facts
and
opinions
which
are
fairly
discussed
and
thus
enlightened
views
are
diffused
through
the
mass
of
people
the
councillors
at
first
were
averse
to
the
imposition
or
increase
of
taxation
however
desirable
the
object
might
be
but
pride
and
emulation
very
soon
overcame
this
natural
reluctance
and
the
example
of
some
neighbouring
county
with
that
natural
desire
to
do
good
which
more
or
less
influences
the
feelings
and
conduct
of
all
public
men
were
not
long
in
producing
their
beneficial
results
even
with
the
risk
of
offending
their
constituents
when
the
county
municipal
councils
were
first
established
the
warden
or
president
of
the
council
and
also
the
treasurer
were
appointed
by
the
governor
but
both
these
offices
were
afterwards
made
elective
the
warden
being
elected
by
the
council
from
their
own
body
and
the
treasurer
being
selected
by
them
without
previous
election
by
the
people
lately
councils
have
been
also
established
in
each
township
for
municipal
purposes
affecting
the
interest
of
the
township
only
the
reeves
or
presidents
of
which
minor
councils
form
the
members
of
the
county
council
this
general
system
of
municipalities
and
a
late
act
of
the
provincial
parliament
enabling
the
inhabitants
to
form
themselves
into
road
companies
have
converted
the
formerly
torpid
and
inactive
townships
into
busy
hives
of
industry
and
progressive
improvement
our
agricultural
societies
have
also
played
no
mean
part
in
furthering
the
progress
of
the
colony
in
colonies
fewer
prejudices
are
entertained
on
the
subject
of
agricultural
matters
than
on
any
others
and
the
people
are
ever
ready
to
try
any
experiment
which
offers
any
prospect
of
increased
remuneration
for
labour
education
of
late
has
also
made
rapid
advances
in
this
province
and
now
the
yeomanry
of
the
more
improved
townships
though
they
may
be
inferior
to
the
yeomanry
of
england
in
the
acquirements
derived
from
common
school
education
are
certainly
far
superior
to
them
in
general
intelligence
their
minds
are
better
stocked
with
ideas
and
they
are
infinitely
more
progressive
when
we
consider
the
relative
periods
at
which
the
first
settlements
were
formed
in
the
united
states
and
in
upper
canada
and
the
accumulation
of
capital
in
the
former
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
show
that
the
progress
of
canada
has
been
much
more

the
excavation
of
the
erie
canal
the
parent
of
all
the
subsequent
improvements
of
a
similar
nature
in
the
united
states
for
settlement
a
vast
country
to
the
westward
which
would
otherwise
for
many
years
have
remained
a
wilderness
unfit
for
the
habitation
of
man
the
boundless
success
of
this
experiment
necessarily
led
to
all
the
other
similar
undertakings
the
superior
advantages
canada
enjoyed
in
her
river
and
lake
navigation
imperfect
as
that
navigation
was
operated
in
a
manner
rather
to
retard
than
to
accelerate
improvements
of
this
kind
while
the
construction
of
the
erie
canal
was
a
matter
of
prospective
necessity
in
order
to
provide
for
a
rapidly
increasing
population
and
immigration
in
the
same
manner
the
recent
completion
of
the
works
on
the
lawrence
and
the
enlargement
of
the
welland
canal
connecting
lakes
erie
and
ontario
will
just
as
necessarily
be
followed
by
similar
results
with
the
additional
advantage
of
the
whole
colony
being
greatly
benefitted
by
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
in
addition
to
her
own
we
have
now
thanks
to
responsible
government
municipal
councils
and
common
schools
no
longer
any
reason
to
consider
their
institutions
better
calculated
to
develope
the
resources
of
the
colony
than
our
own
our
interests
are
almost
identical
and
with
our
canals
and
railroads
on
both
sides
mutually
beneficial
our
former
hostility
has
merged
into
a
friendly
rivalry
in
the
march
of
intellect
and
we
may
now
truly
say
that
without
wishing
for
any
change
in
political
institutions
which
are
most
congenial
to
the
feelings
of
the
people
where
they
exist
each
country
now
sincerely
rejoices
in
the
prosperity
of
its
neighbour
before
concluding
this
chapter
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
the
reader
a
short
description
of
the
county
of
hastings
in
which
i
have
held
the
office
of
sheriff
for
the
last
twelve
years
and
which
i
believe
possesses
many
advantages
as
a
place
of
settlement
over
all
the
other
places
i
have
seen
in
the
upper
province
i
should
premise
however
lest
my
partiality
for
this
part
of
the
colony
should
be
supposed
to
incline
me
to
overrate
its
comparative
advantages
to
the
settler
that
my
statements
are
principally
intended
to
show
the
progress
of
upper
province
generally
and
that
when
i
claim
any
superiority
for
this
part
of
it
i
shall
give
what
i
trust
the
reader
will
consider
satisfactory
reasons
for
my
conclusion
the
settlement
of
a
country
when
it
is
left
to
chance
is
a
most
uncertain
and
capricious
matter
the
narrow
views
and
interests
of
a
clique
in
the
colony
or
even
of
an
influential
individual
often
direct
emigration
out
of
its
natural
course
involving
unnecessary
suffering
to
the
settler
a
waste
or
absolute
loss
of
capital
and
a
retarding
of
the
progress
of
the
country
the
circumstances
and
situation
of
the
united
states
were
less
productive
of
these
evils
than
those
of
upper
canada
because
settlement
went
on
more
uniformly
from
the
seacoast
towards
the
interior
the
mighty
rivers
and
lakes
of
canada
though
productive
of
boundless
prosperity
operated
in
the
first
period
of
its
settlement
most
unfavourably
on
the
growth
of
the
colony
by
throwing
open
for
settlement
an
extensive
inland
coast
at
that
time
unconnected
with
the
ocean
by
means
of
canals
hence
numerous
detached
feeble
and
unprogressive
settlements
came
into
existence
where
the
new
settlers
had
to
struggle
for
years
with
the
most
disheartening
difficulties
european
settlers
know
but
little
of
the
value
of
situation
in
most
cases
they
are
only
desirous
of
acquiring
a
large
extent
of
land
at
a
low
price
and
thus
unless
restrained
by
the
wise
regulations
of
a
provident
government
they
too
often
ruin
themselves
and
waste
their
capital
in
a
wilderness
where
it
does
good
to
no
one
when
emigration
from
the
united
kingdom
began
to
set
in
to
upper
canada
the
pernicious
speculation
in
wild
lands
commenced
in
earnest
as
most
of
the
land
speculators
possessed
shares
in
the
on
lake
ontario
the
interests
of
both
speculations
were
combined
it
was
of
course
the
interest
of
the
proprietors
to
direct
emigration
as
far
to
the
westward
as
possible
and
influenced
by
their
interested
representations
and
those
of
the
land
speculators
settled
in
toronto
cobourg
and
hamilton
the
greater
portion
of
the
emigrants
possessing
capital
were
thrown
into
these
towns
near
which
they
were
led
to
expect
desirable
locations
in
the
same
manner
the
agents
of
the
canada
land
company
who
were
to
be
found
on
every
steamer
were
actively
employed
in
directing
the
emigrants
to
the
huron
tract
by
a
simple
inspection
of
the
map
of
upper
canada
it
will
be
seen
that
as
the
bay
of
quinte
was
out
of
the
general
route
of
the
steamers
and
too
near
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
navigation
it
did
not
suit
the
views
of
the
parties
most
interested
to
direct
emigration
to
its
shores
thus
the
beautiful
bay
of
quinte
with
the
most
fertile
land
on
its
shores
and
scenery
which
exceeds
in
variety
and
picturesque
beauty
that
of
any
part
of
upper
canada
hamilton
and
niagara
alone
excepted
has
been
passed
by
for
years
for
situations
much
less
desirable
or
attractive
to
european
settlers
the
forbidding
aspect
of
the
country
near
kingston
which
is
situated
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
from
the
lawrence
where
the
soil
has
a
rocky
and
barren
appearance
has
no
doubt
deterred
emigrants
from
proceeding
in
this
direction
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
quinte
were
originally
occupied
principally
by
loyalists
and
retired
officers
who
had
served
during
the
late
war
with
the
united
states
but
the
emigration
from
europe
has
chiefly
consisted
of
the
poorer
class
of
irish
catholics
and
of
protestants
from
the
north
of
ireland
settled
in
two
very
thriving
townships
in
the
county
of
hastings
there
is
also
a
sprinkling
of
scotch
and
english
in
different
parts
of
the
county
comparatively
few
possessing
any
considerable
amount
of
capital
have
found
their
way
here
as
the
county
town
belleville
is
not
in
the
line
of
the
summer
travel
on
the
lakes
the
scenery
along
the
shores
of
the
bay
is
exceedingly
beautiful
all
the
way
from
kingston
to
the
head
where
a
large
river
the
trent
discharges
itself
into
it
at
a
thriving
village
of
about
a
thousand
inhabitants
called
trent
port
a
summer
ride
along
the
lower
portion
of
this
river
presents
scenery
of
a
bolder
and
grander
character
than
is
often
met
with
in
upper
canada
and
it
is
enlivened
by
spectacles
of
immense
rafts
of
timber
descending
the
rapids
and
by
the
merry
chorus
of
the
lumbermen
as
they
pursue
their
toilsome
and
perilous
voyage
to
quebec
belleville
was
originally
a
spot
reserved
for
the
mississagua
indians
and
was
laid
out
in
for
a
village
when
there
were
only
two
or
three
white
men
settled
among
them
as
traders
in
the
place
it
was
only
during
the
last
year
that
the
two
frame
situated
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
were
removed
to
make
room
for
more
substantial
buildings
belleville
remained
nearly
stationary
for
several
years
during
which
a
few
persons
realised
handsome
fortunes
by
means
of
large
profits
not
withstanding
the
limited
extent
of
their
business
it
at
length
began
to
grow
in
importance
as
the
fine
country
in
its
neighbourhood
was
cleared
and
rendered
productive
in
when
the
county
of
hastings
was
set
apart
from
the
midland
district
under
the
name
of
the
district
of
victoria
and
belleville
became
the
district
town
the
population
of
the
county
including
belleville
was
about
and
that
of
belleville
about
in
the
population
of
the
county
had
reached
of
which
that
of
belleville
was
by
the
census
just
taken
on
a
much
more
correct
principle
than
formerly
the
population
of
belleville
in
appears
to
be
showing
an
increase
of
in
two
years
during
the
same
period
from
to
the
population
of
cobourg
on
lake
ontario
which
town
formerly
enjoyed
the
full
benefit
of
a
large
emigration
has
risen
from
to
showing
an
increase
of
only
the
town
of
dundas
in
the
same
time
has
increased
its
population
from
in
to
in
showing
an
increase
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
hamilton
in
was
and
now
in
it
is
said
to
exceed
in
the
then
of
hamilton
contained
a
population
of
only
when
i
first
visited
that
place
in
it
was
a
dull
insignificant
village
which
might
i
suppose
contain
a
population
of
or
i
can
hardly
describe
my
surprise
on
revisiting
it
in
to
behold
a
city
grown
up
suddenly
as
if
by
enchantment
with
several
handsome
churches
and
public
and
private
buildings
of
cut
stone
brought
from
the
fine
freestone
quarries
in
the
precipitous
mountains
or
tableland
behind
the
city
little
need
be
said
of
the
capital
of
the
province
the
city
of
toronto
the
progress
of
which
has
been
less
remarkable
in
the
same
period
for
the
obvious
reason
that
its
merits
were
sooner
appreciated
or
known
by
the
emigrants
from
europe
the
population
of
toronto
then
called
little
york
in
was
while
that
of
the
now
city
of
kingston
was
in
the
population
of
toronto
was
and
that
of
kingston
in
the
population
of
toronto
was
and
that
of
kingston
these
few
facts
will
enable
the
reader
to
form
some
idea
of
the
comparative
progress
of
different
towns
in
upper
canada
under
circumstances
similar
in
some
cases
and
different
in
others
when
it
is
considered
that
all
of
these
towns
have
for
many
years
reaped
the
full
benefit
of
the
influx
of
emigration
and
capital
from
the
mother
country
while
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
quinte
were
little
known
or
appreciated
it
will
appear
that
the
progress
of
belleville
has
been
at
least
equal
to
that
of
any
of
them
the
prosperity
of
belleville
may
in
fact
be
almost
entirely
attributed
to
the
gradual
development
of
its
own
internal
resources
the
fertility
of
the
lands
in
its
vicinity
and
a
large
exportation
of
late
years
of
lumber
of
all
kinds
to
the
united
states
having
no
desire
unnecessarily
to
trouble
the
reader
with
dry
statistical
tables
i
shall
merely
quote
the
following
facts
and
figures
kindly
furnished
me
by
benjamin
the
present
warden
of
the
county
of
hastings
to
whose
business
talents
and
public
spirit
the
county
is
largely
indebted
for
its
progress
in
internal
improvement
the
increase
of
business
at
the
port
of
belleville
has
been
most
extraordinary
in
the
total
amount
of
duties
paid
at
this
port
amounted
to
and
in
the
year
the
amount
reached

the
river
moira
passing
through
belleville
where
it
discharges
itself
into
the
bay
of
quinte
is
one
principal
source
of
its
prosperity
the
preceding
statement
will
show
the
quantity
of
sawed
lumber
exported
most
of
which
is
furnished
by
the
of
belleville
or
its
immediate
vicinity
besides
saw
and
there
are
cloth
and
paper
manufactories
a
manufactory
of
edge
tools
pail
manufactories
where
great
quantities
of
these
useful
articles
are
made
at
a
low
price
by
machinery
planing
machines
several
iron
foundries
breweries
distilleries
in
almost
all
of
which
establishments
or
from
the
river
are
used
a
remarkable
feature
in
belleville
in
common
with
other
towns
in
canada
is
the
great
number
of
tailoring
and
establishments
when
compared
with
towns
of
an
equal
population
in
great
britain
this
shows
more
than
anything
i
am
aware
of
the
general
prosperity
of
the
people
who
can
afford
to
be
large
consumers
of
such
articles
there
is
very
little
difference
to
be
observed
in
the
costliness
of
the
clothing
of
the
different
classes
of
society
in
upper
canadian
towns
and
cities
and
much
less
difference
in
the
taste
with
which
these
articles
are
selected
than
might
be
expected
with
the
exception
of
the
lower
class
of
labourers
all
persons
are
well
and
suitably
clad
and
they
can
afford
to
be
so
twelve
years
ago
there
were
not
more
than
five
or
six
in
belleville
now
there
are
nearly
one
hundred
of
a
superior
description
costing
from
to
pounds
another
remarkable
circumstance
in
upper
canada
is
the
number
of
lawyers
in
all
the
towns
in
belleville
there
are
about
a
dozen
which
seems
to
be
a
large
number
for
a
town
containing
only
inhabitants
when
in
an
english
town
of
the
same
size
there
is
often
not
more
than
one
of
course
i
do
not
mention
this
as
any
particular
advantage
but
to
show
the
great
difference
in
the
amount
of
transactions
and
of
subjects
of
contention
in
an
old
and
a
new
country
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
number
of
newspapers
as
indicative
of
commercial
activity
two
newspapers
representing
the
two
political
parties
are
in
belleville
both
by
their
subscribers
and
the
number
of
advertisements
the
mouth
of
the
moira
river
which
widens
out
at
its
junction
with
the
bay
of
quinte
is
completely
covered
with
and
square
timber
of
various
kinds
during
the
summer
months
this
river
at
belleville
is
often
dammed
up
by
confused
piles
of
timber
no
sooner
are
these
removed
than
its
waters
are
covered
over
by
vast
quantities
of
oak
staves
which
are
floated
down
separately
to
be
rafted
off
like
the
squared
lumber
for
the
quebec
market
the
greater
proportion
of
the
are
however
cut
up
for
exportation
to
the
united
states
by
the
various
on
the
river
or
by
a
large
steam
with
twenty
or
thirty
run
of
saws
erected
on
a
little
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
several
large
schooners
are
constantly
loading
with
sawed
lumber
and
there
are
two
or
three
steamboats
always
running
between
belleville
and
kingston
carrying
passengers
to
and
fro
and
generally
heavily
laden
with
goods
or
produce
the
bay
of
quinte
offers
more
than
common
facilities
in
the
summer
months
for
rapid
and
safe
communication
with
other
places
and
in
the
winter
time
being
but
slightly
affected
by
the
current
of
the
river
trent
it
affords
excellent
sleighing
large
quantities
of
wheat
and
other
farm
produce
are
transported
over
the
ice
to
belleville
from
the
neighbouring
county
of
prince
edward
which
is
an
exceedingly
prosperous
agricultural
settlement
yielding
wheat
of
the
finest
quality
and
particularly
excellent
cheese
and
butter
the
scenery
on
the
shores
of
prince
edward
is
exceedingly
picturesque
and
there
are
numerous
wharfs
at
short
distances
from
whence
the
farmers
roll
their
barrels
of
flour
and
other
articles
on
board
the
steamers
on
their
way
to
market
i
have
seen
no
scenery
in
upper
canada
presenting
the
same
variety
and
beauty
as
that
of
the
shores
of
prince
edward
in
particular
the
peninsular
situation
of
this
county
is
its
only
disadvantage
being
out
of
the
line
of
the
land
travel
and
of
the
telegraphic
communication
which
passes
through
belleville
the
county
of
prince
edward
having
nearly
exhausted
its
exportation
lumber
the
people
are
thus
freed
from
the
evils
of
a
trade
that
is
always
more
or
less
demoralising
in
its
tendency
and
can
now
give
their
undivided
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
their
farms
certain
it
is
that
more
quiet
industrious
and
prosperous
settlers
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
province
a
few
miles
below
belleville
on
the
south
side
of
the
bay
is
a
very
remarkable
natural
curiosity
called
the
stone
on
the
summit
of
a
rising
abruptly
several
hundred
feet
above
the
shore
of
the
bay
there
is
a
lake
of
considerable
size
and
very
great
depth
and
which
apparently
receives
a
very
inadequate
supply
from
the
elevated
land
on
which
it
is
situated
the
lake
has
no
natural
outlet
and
the
common
opinion
is
that
it
is
unfathomable
and
that
it
is
supplied
with
water
by
means
of
a
subterranean
communication
with
lake
huron
or
some
other
lake
at
the
same
level
this
is
of
course
extremely
improbable
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
great
depth
and
that
it
can
not
be
supplied
from
the
bay
of
quinte
so
far
beneath
its
level
as
a
small
rivulet
runs
into
this
lake
from
the
flat
ground
in
its
vicinity
and
as
the
soil
of
this
remarkable
excavation
however
it
may
have
been
originally
formed
is
tenacious
i
think
we
require
no
such
improbable
theory
to
account
for
its
existence
availing
himself
of
the
convenient
position
of
this
lake
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
erected
a
mill
which
gives
its
name
to
the
lake
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
of
quinte
and
which
he
supplied
with
water
by
making
a
deep
cutting
from
the
lake
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
from
whence
it
is
conveyed
in
troughs
to
the
mill
there
is
a
somewhat
similar
lake
in
the
township
of
sidney
in
the
county
of
hastings
covering
some
hundred
acres
this
lake
is
also
of
great
depth
though
situated
on
the
summit
of
a
range
of
high
hills
from
whence
it
gets
the
name
of
the
oak
hill
the
bay
of
quinte
abounds
in
excellent
fish
of
various
kinds
affording
excellent
sport
to
those
who
are
fond
of
fishing
when
the
ice
breaks
up
in
the
spring
immense
shoals
of
pickerel
commence
running
up
the
moira
river
at
belleville
to
spawn
in
the
interior
at
that
time
a
number
of
young
men
amuse
themselves
with
spearing
them
standing
on
the
flat
rocks
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
which
crosses
the
river
they
dart
their
spears
into
the
rushing
waters
at
in
the
darkness
bringing
up
a
large
fish
at
every
second
or
third
stroke
my
eldest
son
a
youth
of
fifteen
sometimes
caught
so
many
fish
in
this
manner
in
two
or
three
hours
that
we
had
to
send
a
large
wheelbarrow
to
fetch
them
home
formerly
before
so
many
mills
were
erected
the
fish
swarmed
in
incredible
numbers
in
all
our
rivers
and
lakes
in
the
there
is
excellent
and
parties
are
often
formed
for
this
purpose
by
the
young
men
who
bring
home
whole
of
venison
while
speaking
of
belleville
i
may
mention
as
one
of
its
chief
advantages
the
long
period
for
which
the
sleighing
continues
in
this
part
of
the
country
when
compared
with
other
places
on
the
shore
of
lake
ontario
nearly
the
whole
winter
there
is
excellent
sleighing
on
the
bay
of
quinte
and
on
the
land
we
have
weeks
of
good
sleighing
for
days
in
most
other
places
this
is
owing
to
the
influence
of
a
large
sheet
of
frozen
water
interposed
between
us
and
lake
ontario
which
is
never
frozen
the
county
of
prince
edward
is
a
peninsula
connected
with
the
main
land
by
a
narrow
isthmus
of
low
swampy
land
about
four
miles
wide
through
this
neck
of
land
it
has
long
been
in
contemplation
to
cut
a
canal
to
enable
the
lake
to
take
belleville
in
their
route
between
kingston
and
toronto
thus
affording
a
safe
navigation
in
stormy
weather
the
effect
of
such
a
work
on
the
prosperity
of
the
counties
of
hastings
and
prince
edward
would
be
very
great
as
european
emigrants
would
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
country
which
has
hitherto
escaped
their
notice
from
the
causes
already
mentioned
besides
the
usual
variety
of
churches
there
is
a
and
also
four
large
common
schools
which
latter
are
free
schools
being
supported
by
assessments
on
the
people
of
the
town
every
saturday
which
is
the
great
day
for
business
from
the
country
the
streets
are
crowded
with
farmers
waggons
or
sleighs
with
their
wives
and
pretty
daughters
who
come
in
to
make
their
little
purchases
of
silk
gowns
and
ribbons
and
to
sell
their
butter
and
eggs
which
are
the
peculiar
perquisites
for
the
females
in
this
country
the
counties
of
hastings
and
prince
edward
are
celebrated
for
female
beauty
and
nowhere
can
you
see
people
in
the
same
class
more
becomingly
attired
at
the
same
time
there
is
nothing
rustic
about
them
except
genuine
good
nature
and
unaffected
simplicity
of
manners
to
judge
by
their
light
elastic
step
and
rosy
smiling
countenances
no
people
on
earth
seem
to
enjoy
a
greater
share
of
health
and
contentment
since
the
establishment
of
the
county
municipal
councils
plank
and
macadamised
roads
have
branched
out
in
all
directions
from
the
various
central
county
towns
stretching
their
ramifications
like
the
veins
of
the
human
body
conveying
nourishment
and
prosperity
throughout
the
country
increasing
the
trade
and
the
travel
connecting
man
with
man
and
promoting
intelligence
and
civilisation
while
the
magnetic
telegraph
now
traversing
the
whole
length
of
the
country
like
the
nervous
system
still
further
stimulates
the
inhabitants
to
increased
activity
the
people
of
this
county
have
not
been
behind
their
neighbours
in
these
improvements
the
first
which
they
constructed
was
from
belleville
to
canniff
mills
a
distance
of
three
miles
over
a
road
which
at
the
time
was
often
in
mud
with
a
solid
foundation
of
flat
limestone
rock
which
prevented
the
escape
of
the
water
so
infamous
was
this
road
that
on
some
parts
of
it
it
was
a
matter
of
serious
doubt
whether
a
boat
or
waggon
would
be
the
better
mode
of
conveyance
notwithstanding
the
badness
of
this
road
it
was
the
greatest
thoroughfare
in
the
county
as
it
was
the
only
approach
to
a
number
of
mills
situated
on
the
river
and
to
belleville
from
the
back
country
it
was
however
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
the
warden
could
induce
the
other
members
of
the
to
sanction
the
construction
of
a
at
the
expense
of
the
county
so
little
was
then
known
in
canada
of
the
effects
of
such
works
the
profits
yielded
by
this
road
are
unusually
large
amounting
it
is
said
to
seventy
or
eighty
per
cent
this
extraordinary
success
encouraged
the
people
to
undertake
other
lines
by
means
of
companies
formed
among
the
farmers
all
these
are
highly
remunerative
averaging
it
is
stated
fourteen
per
cent
over
and
above
all
expenses
of
repair
more
than
thirty
miles
of
is
already
constructed
in
the
county
in
a
few
years
plank
or
gravel
roads
will
be
extended
through
every
part
of
the
country
and
they
will
be
most
available
as
feeders
to
the
great
line
of
railway
which
will
very
soon
be
constructed
through
the
entire
length
of
the
province
and
which
has
been
already
commenced
at
toronto
and
hamilton
a
single
track
costs
from
to
pounds
per
mile
according
to
the
value
of
the
land
to
be
purchased
or
other
local
causes
the
cost
of
a
gravel
road
laid
twelve
feet
wide
and
nine
inches
deep
and
feet
from
out
to
out
is
from
to
pounds
and
it
is
much
more
lasting
and
more
easily
repaired
than
a
macadamised
or
gravel
roads
will
no
doubt
entirely
supersede
the
others
in
the
present
circumstances
of
the
colony
however
will
be
preferred
because
they
are
more
quickly
constructed
and
with
less
immediate
outlay
of
money
in
the
payment
of
wages
as
our
numerous
enable
the
farmers
to
get
their
own
logs
sawed
and
they
thus
pay
the
greater
portion
of
their
instalments
on
the
stock
taken
in
the
roads
in
fact
by
making
arrangements
with
the
proprietors
of
they
can
generally
manage
to
get
several
months
credit
so
that
they
will
receive
the
first
dividends
from
the
road
before
they
will
be
required
to
pay
any
money
the
mode
of
making
these
roads
is
exceedingly
simple
the
space
required
for
the
road
is
first
levelled
ditched
and
drained
and
then
pieces
of
scantling
five
or
six
inches
square
are
laid
longitudinally
on
each
side
at
the
proper
distance
for
a
twelve
feet
wide
and
with
the
ends
of
each
piece
sawn
off
diagonally
so
as
to
rest
on
the
end
of
the
next
piece
which
is
similarly
prepared
to
prevent
the
road
from
settling
down
unequally
the
pieces
of
scantling
thus
connected
are
simply
bedded
firmly
in
the
ground
which
is
levelled
up
to
their
upper
edges
pine
planks
three
inches
thick
are
then
laid
across
with
their
ends
resting
on
the
scantling
the
planks
are
closely
wedged
together
like
the
flooring
of
a
house
and
secured
here
and
there
by
strong
wooden
pins
driven
into
bored
through
the
planks
into
the
scantling
the
common
way
is
to
lay
the
at
right
angles
with
the
scantling
but
a
much
better
way
has
been
adopted
in
the
county
of
hastings
the
planks
are
here
laid
diagonally
which
of
course
requires
that
they
should
be
cut
several
feet
longer
this
ensures
greater
durability
as
the
shoes
of
the
horses
cut
up
the
planks
much
more
when
the
grain
of
the
wood
corresponds
in
direction
with
their
sharp
edges
when
a
double
track
is
required
three
longitudinal
courses
of
scantling
are
used
and
the
ends
of
the
planks
meet
on
the
centre
one
very
few
if
any
iron
nails
are
generally
used
the
great
advantage
of
a
is
the
large
load
it
enables
the
horses
to
draw
whilst
on
a
common
road
a
farmer
can
only
carry
bushels
of
wheat
in
his
waggon
a
will
enable
him
to
carry
forty
or
fifty
bushels
of
the
same
grain
with
a
pair
of
horses
the
principal
disadvantage
of
the
is
that
they
are
found
by
experience
to
be
injurious
to
horses
particularly
when
they
are
driven
quickly
on
them
they
are
best
adapted
for
a
large
load
drawn
at
a
slow
pace
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
belleville
or
the
more
northern
parts
of
the
county
it
will
suffice
to
observe
that
the
country
is
generally
much
varied
in
its
surface
and
beautiful
and
the
soil
is
generally
excellent
within
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
the
whole
country
has
been
studded
with
good
substantial
stone
or
brick
houses
or
good
white
painted
frame
houses
even
for
thirty
miles
back
and
the
farms
are
well
fenced
and
cultivated
showing
undeniable
signs
of
comfort
and
independence
streams
and
water
are
abundant
and
there
are
several
thriving
villages
and
hamlets
scattered
through
the
county
the
village
of
canniff
mills
three
miles
from
belleville
and
soon
destined
to
form
a
part
of
it
alone
containing
a
population
of
about
a
thousand
in
describing
the
progress
of
this
county
i
may
be
understood
as
describing
that
of
most
other
counties
in
the
upper
province
the
progress
of
all
of
them
being
rapid
though
varying
according
to
the
advantages
of
situation
or
from
causes
already
alluded
to
from
what
has
been
said
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
present
condition
of
canada
generally
is
exceedingly
prosperous
and
when
the
resources
of
the
country
are
fully
developed
by
the
railroads
now
in
progress
of
construction
and
by
the
influx
of
capital
and
population
from
europe
no
rational
person
can
doubt
that
it
will
ultimately
be
as
prosperous
and
opulent
as
any
country
in
the
world
ancient
or
modern
it
may
be
said
should
we
not
then
be
hopeful
and
contented
with
our
situation
and
and
so
the
people
are
in
the
main
and
the
shrewd
capitalists
of
england
think
so
or
they
would
not
be
so
ready
to
invest
their
money
in
our
public
works
but
some
deduction
from
this
general
state
of
contentment
and
confidence
must
be
made
for
those
little
discontents
and
grumblings
created
by
the
misrepresentations
of
certain
disappointed
politicians
and
ambitious
men
of
all
parties
who
expect
to
gain
popularity
by
becoming
much
has
been
done
and
a
great
deal
still
remains
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
reform
here
as
elsewhere
but
there
never
was
any
just
cause
or
motive
in
that
insane
cry
for
annexation
to
the
united
states
which
was
raised
some
years
ago
and
by
the
tories
too
of
all
people
in
the
world
the
annexation
mania
can
now
only
be
regarded
as
indicative
of
the
last
expiring
struggle
of
a
domineering
party
it
would
not
be
correct
to
call
it
a
political
party
which
had
so
long
obstructed
the
progress
of
canada
by
its
selfish
and
monopolising
spirit
when
it
found
that
its
reign
had
ceased
for
ever
great
sacrifices
have
been
and
will
be
made
by
men
of
loyalty
and
principle
in
support
of
institutions
which
are
justly
dear
to
every
briton
and
to
every
freeman
but
this
feeling
necessarily
has
its
limits
among
the
mass
of
mankind
and
the
loyalty
of
a
people
must
be
supported
by
reason
and
justice
they
should
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
their
institutions
are
more
conducive
to
happiness
and
prosperity
than
those
of
all
other
countries
without
this
conviction
loyalty
in
a
people
who
have
by
any
means
been
deprived
of
the
power
of
correcting
the
abuses
of
their
government
would
be
hardly
rational
canadians
now
have
that
power
to
its
full
extent
why
then
should
we
not
be
loyal
to
the
constitution
of
our
country
which
has
stood
the
test
of
ages
purifying
itself
and
developing
its
native
energies
as
a
vigorous
constitution
outgrows
disease
in
the
human
frame
the
government
of
canada
is
practically
more
republican
than
that
of
the
mother
country
and
nearly
as
republican
as
that
of
the
united
states
our
government
is
also
notoriously
much
less
expensive
our
public
officers
are
also
practically
much
more
responsible
to
the
people
though
indirectly
because
they
are
appointed
by
a
colonial
ministry
who
are
elected
by
the
people
and
whose
popularity
depends
in
a
great
degree
on
the
selections
they
make
and
upon
their
watchfulness
over
their
conduct
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
not
a
cheap
government
because
all
officers
being
elective
by
the
people
the
responsibility
of
the
selections
to
office
is
divided
and
weakened
moreover
the
change
or
prospect
of
the
electors
being
the
elected
inclines
them
to
put
up
with
abuses
and
defalcations
which
would
be
considered
intolerable
under
another
form
of
government
the
british
government
now
holds
the
best
security
for
the
continued
loyalty
of
the
people
of
canada
in
their
increasing
prosperity
to
great
britain
they
are
bound
by
the
strongest
ties
of
duty
and
interest
and
nothing
but
the
basest
ingratitude
or
absolute
infatuation
can
ever
tempt
them
to
transfer
their
allegiance
to
another
country
i
shall
conclude
this
chapter
with
a
few
verses
written
two
years
ago
and
which
were
suggested
by
an
indignant
feeling
at
the
cold
manner
with
which
the
national
anthem
was
received
by
some
persons
who
used
to
be
loud
in
their
professions
of
loyalty
on
former
public
occasions
happily
this
wayward
and
pettish
i
will
not
call
it
disloyal
spirit
has
passed
away
and
most
of
the
annexationists
are
now
heartily
ashamed
of
their
conduct
god
save
the
queen
god
save
the
queen
the
time
has
been
when
these
charmed
words
or
said
or
sung
have
through
the
welkin
proudly
rung
and
heads
uncovered
every
tongue
has
echoed
back
god
save
the
queen
god
save
the
queen
it
was
not
like
the
feeble
cry
that
slaves
might
raise
as
tyrants
pass
with
trembling
knees
and
hearts
downcast
while
dungeoned
victims
breathed
their
last
in
mingled
groans
of
agony
god
save
the
queen
nor
were
these
shouts
without
the
will
which
servile
crowds
oft
send
on
high
when
gold
and
jewels
meet
the
eye
when
pride
looks
down
on
poverty
and
makes
the
poor
man
poorer
still
god
save
the
queen
no
it
was
like
the
thrilling
shout
the
joyous
sounds
of
price
and
praise
that
patriot
hearts
are
wont
to
raise
cannon
roar
and
bonfires
blaze
when
britain
foes
are
put
to
rout
god
save
the
queen
for
those
sounds
to

one

moves
that

such

these
in

no

appendix
a

to
the
third
edition
published
by
richard
bentley
in
in
justice
to
moodie
it
is
right
to
state
that
being
still
resident
in
the
of
canada
she
has
not
been
able
to
superintend
this
work
whilst
passing
through
the
press
from
this
circumstance
some
verbal
mistakes
and
oversights
may
have
occurred
but
the
greatest
care
has
been
taken
to
avoid
them
although
well
known
as
an
authoress
in
canada
and
a
member
of
a
family
which
has
enriched
english
literature
with
works
of
very
high
popularity
moodie
is
chiefly
remembered
in
this
country
by
a
volume
of
poems
published
in
under
her
maiden
name
of
susanna
strickland
during
the
rebellion
in
canada
her
loyal
lyrics
prompted
by
strong
affection
for
her
native
country
were
circulated
and
sung
throughout
the
colony
and
produced
a
great
effect
in
rousing
an
enthusiastic
feeling
in
favour
of
law
and
order
another
of
her
lyrical
compositions
the
charming
sleigh
song
printed
in
the
present
work
at
the
end
of
chapter
vii
has
been
extremely
popular
in
canada
the
warmth
of
feeling
which
beams
through
every
line
and
the
touching
truthfulness
of
its
details
won
for
it
a
reception
there
as
universal
as
it
was
favourable
the
glowing
narrative
of
personal
incident
and
suffering
which
she
gives
in
the
present
work
will
no
doubt
attract
general
attention
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
out
delineations
of
fortitude
under
privation
more
interesting
or
more
pathetic
than
those
contained
in
her
second
volume

introductory
chapter
to

first

i
landed
with
my
husband
dunbar
moodie
in
canada
moodie
was
the
youngest
son
of
major
moodie
of
mellsetter
in
the
orkney
islands
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
regiment
of
fusileers
and
had
been
severely
wounded
in
the
upon
in
holland
not
being
overgifted
with
the
good
things
of
this
world
the
younger
sons
of
old
british
families
seldom
are
he
had
after
mature
deliberation
determined
to
try
his
fortunes
in
canada
and
settle
upon
the
grant
of
acres
of
land
ceded
by
the
government
to
officers
upon
emigration
in
most
cases
and
ours
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
is
a
matter
of
necessity
not
of
choice
it
may
indeed
generally
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
duty
performed
at
the
expense
of
personal
enjoyment
and
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
those
local
attachments
which
stamp
the
scenes
in
which
our
childhood
grew
in
imperishable
characters
upon
the
heart
nor
is
it
until
adversity
has
pressed
hard
upon
the
wounded
spirit
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
old
but
impoverished
families
that
they
can
subdue
their
proud
and
rebellious
feelings
and
submit
to
make
the
trial
this
was
our
case
and
our
motive
for
emigrating
to
one
of
the
british
colonies
can
be
summed
up
in
a
few
words
the
emigrant
hope
of
bettering
his
condition
and
securing
a
sufficient
competence
to
support
his
family
to
free
himself
from
the
slighting
remarks
too
often
hurled
at
the
poor
gentleman
by
the
practical
people
of
the
world
which
is
always
galling
to
a
proud
man
but
doubly
so
when
he
knows
that
the
want
of
wealth
constitues
the
sole
difference
between
him
and
the
more
favoured
offspring
of
the
same
parent
stock
in
the
tide
of
emigration
flowed
westward
and
canada
became
the
great
landmark
for
the
rich
in
hope
and
poor
in
purse
public
newspapers
and
private
letters
teemed
with
the
almost
fabulous
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
settlement
in
this
highly
favoured
region
men
who
had
been
doubtful
of
supporting
their
families
in
comfort
at
home
thought
that
they
had
only
to
land
in
canada
to
realize
a
fortune
the
infection
became
general
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
from
the
middle
ranks
of
british
society
for
the
space
of
three
or
four
years
landed
upon
these
shores
a
large
majority
of
these
emigrants
were
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
with
their
families
a
class
perfectly
unfitted
by
their
previous
habits
and
standing
in
society
for
contending
with
the
stern
realities
of
emigrant
life
in
the
backwoods
a
class
formed
mainly
from
the
younger
scions
of
great
families
naturally
proud
and
not
only
accustomed
to
command
but
to
recieve
implicit
obedience
from
the
people
under
them
are
not
men
adapted
to
the
hard
toil
of
the
woodman
life
nor
will
such
persons
submit
cheerfully
to
the
saucy
familiarity
of
servants
who
republicans
at
heart
think
themselves
quite
as
good
as
their
employers
too
many
of
these
brave
and
honest
men
took
up
their
grants
of
wild
land
in
remote
and
unfavourable
localities
far
from
churches
schools
and
markets
and
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
land
speculators
that
swarmed
in
every
rising
village
on
the
borders
of
civilization
it
was
to
warn
such
settlers
as
these
last
mentioned
not
to
take
up
grants
and
pitch
their
tents
in
the
wilderness
and
by
so
doing
reduce
themselves
and
their
families
to
hopeless
poverty
that
my
work
roughing
it
in
the
bush
was
written
i
gave
the
experience
of
the
first
seven
years
we
passed
in
the
woods
attempting
to
clear
a
bush
farm
as
a
warning
to
others
and
the
number
of
persons
who
have
since
told
me
that
my
book
told
the
history
of
their
own
life
in
the
woods
ought
to
be
the
best
proof
to
every
candid
mind
that
i
spoke
the
truth
it
is
not
by
such
feeble
instruments
as
the
above
that
providence
works
when
it
seeks
to
reclaim
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
and
make
them
subservient
to
the
wants
and
happiness
of
its
creatures
the
great
father
of
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
knows
the
arm
which
wholesome
labour
from
the
infancy
has
made
strong
the
nerves
that
have
become
iron
by
patient
endurance
and
he
chooses
such
to
send
forth
into
the
forest
to
hew
out
the
rough
paths
for
the
advance
of
civilization
these
men
became
wealthy
and
prosperous
and
are
the
bones
and
sinews
of
a
great
and
rising
country
their
labour
is
wealth
not
exhaustion
it
produces
content
not
and
despair
what
the
backwoods
of
canada
are
to
the
industrious
and
sons
of
honest
poverty
and
what
they
are
to
the
refined
and
polished
gentleman
these
sketches
have
endeavoured
to
show
the
poor
man
is
in
his
native
element
the
poor
gentleman
totally
unfitted
by
his
previous
habits
and
education
to
be
a
hewer
of
the
forest
and
a
tiller
of
the
soil
what
money
he
brought
out
with
him
is
lavishly
expended
during
the
first
two
years
in
paying
for
labour
to
clear
and
fence
lands
which
from
his
ignorance
of
agricultural
pursuits
will
never
make
him
the
least
profitable
return
and
barely
find
coarse
food
for
his
family
of
clothing
we
say
nothing
bare
feet
and
rags
are
too
common
in
the
bush
now
had
the
same
means
and
the
same
labour
been
employed
in
the
cultivation
of
a
leased
farm
or
one
purchased
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
near
a
village
how
different
would
have
been
the
results
not
only
to
the
settler
but
it
would
have
added
greatly
to
the
wealth
and
social
improvement
of
the
country
i
am
well
aware
that
a
great
and
i
must
think
a
most
unjust
prejudice
has
been
felt
against
my
book
in
canada
because
i
dared
to
give
my
opinion
freely
on
a
subject
which
had
engrossed
a
great
deal
of
my
attention
nor
do
i
believe
that
the
account
of
our
failure
in
the
bush
ever
deterred
a
single
emigrant
from
coming
to
the
country
as
the
only
circulation
it
ever
had
in
the
colony
was
chiefly
through
the
volumes
that
often
formed
a
portion
of
their
baggage
the
many
who
have
condemned
the
work
without
reading
it
will
be
surprised
to
find
that
not
one
word
has
been
said
to
prejudice
intending
emigrants
from
making
canada
their
home
unless
indeed
they
ascribe
the
regret
expressed
at
having
to
leave
my
native
land
so
natural
in
the
painful
which
for
several
months
preys
upon
the
health
and
spirits
of
the
dejected
exile
to
a
dislike
to
the
country
so
far
from
this
being
the
case
my
love
for
the
country
has
steadily
increased
from
year
to
year
and
my
attachment
to
canada
is
now
so
strong
that
i
can
not
imagine
any
inducement
short
of
absolute
necessity
which
could
induce
me
to
leave
the
colony
where
as
a
wife
and
mother
some
of
the
happiest
years
of
my
life
have
been
spent
contrasting
the
first
years
of
my
life
in
the
bush
with
canada
as
she
now
is
my
mind
is
filled
with
wonder
and
gratitude
at
the
rapid
strides
she
has
made
towards
the
fulfilment
of
a
great
and
glorious
destiny
what
important
events
have
been
brought
to
pass
within
the
narrow
circle
of
less
than
forty
years
what
a
difference
since
and
the
country
is
the
same
only
in
name
its
aspect
is
wholly
changed
the
rough
has
become
smooth
the
crooked
has
been
made
straight
the
forests
have
been
converted
into
fruitful
fields
the
rude
log
cabin
of
the
woodsman
has
been
replaced
by
the
handsome
homestead
and
large
populous
cities
have
pushed
the
small
village
into
the
shade
the
solitary
stroke
of
the
axe
that
once
broke
the
uniform
silence
of
the
vast
woods
is
only
heard
in
remote
districts
and
is
superseded
by
the
thundering
tread
of
the
iron
horse
and
the
ceaseless
panting
of
the
in
our
sawmills
and
factories
canada
is
no
longer
a
child
sleeping
in
the
arms
of
nature
dependant
for
her
very
existence
on
the
fostering
care
of
her
illustrious
mother
she
has
outstepped
infancy
and
is
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
a
strong
and
vigorous
youth
what
may
not
we
hope
for
her
maturity
ere
another
forty
summers
have
glided
down
the
stream
of
time
already
she
holds
in
her
hand
the
crown
of
one
of
the
mightiest
empires
that
the
world
has
seen
or
is
yet
to
see
look
at
her
vast
resources
her
fine
healthy
climate
her
fruitful
soil
the
inexhaustible
wealth
of
her
pine
forests
the
untold
treasures
hidden
in
her
unexplored
mines
what
other
country
possesses
such
an
internal
navigation
for
transporting
its
products
from
distant
manitoba
to
the
sea
and
from
thence
to
every
port
in
the
world
if
an
excellent
government
defended
by
wise
laws
a
loyal
people
and
a
free
church
can
make
people
happy
and
proud
of
their
country
surely
we
have
every
reason
to
rejoice
in
our
new
dominion
when
we
first
came
to
the
country
it
was
a
mere
struggle
for
bread
to
the
many
while
all
the
offices
of
emolument
and
power
were
held
by
a
favoured
few
the
country
was
rent
to
pieces
by
political
factions
and
a
fierce
hostility
existed
between
the
native
born
canadians
the
first
pioneers
of
the
forest
and
the
british
emigrants
who
looked
upon
each
other
as
mutual
enemies
who
were
seeking
to
appropriate
the
larger
share
of
the
new
country
those
who
had
settled
down
in
the
woods
were
happily
unconscious
that
these
quarrels
threatened
to
destroy
the
peace
of
the
colony
the
insurrection
of
came
upon
them
like
a
thunder
clap
they
could
hardly
believe
such
an
incredible
tale
intensely
loyal
the
emigrant
officers
rose
to
a
man
to
defend
the
british
flag
and
chastise
the
rebels
and
their
rash
leader
in
their
zeal
to
uphold
british
authority
they
made
no
excuse
for
the
wrongs
that
the
dominant
party
had
heaped
upon
a
clever
and
man
to
them
he
was
a
traitor
and
as
such
a
public
enemy
yet
the
blow
struck
by
that
injured
man
weak
as
it
was
without
money
arms
or
the
necessary
munitions
of
war
and
defeated
and
broken
in
its
first
effort
gave
freedom
to
canada
and
laid
the
foundation
of
the
excellent
constitution
that
we
now
enjoy
it
drew
the
attention
of
the
home
government
to
the
many
abuses
then
practised
in
the
colony
and
made
them
aware
of
its
vast
importance
in
a
political
point
of
view
and
ultimately
led
to
all
our
great
national
improvements
the
settlement
of
the
clergy
reserves
question
and
the
establishment
of
common
schools
was
a
great
boon
to
the
colony
the
opening
up
of
new
townships
the
making
of
roads
the
establishments
of
municipal
councils
in
all
the
old
districts
leaving
to
the
citizens
the
free
choice
of
their
own
members
in
the
council
for
the
management
of
their
affairs
followed
in
rapid
succession
these
changes
of
course
took
some
years
to
accomplish
and
led
to
others
equally
important
the
provincial
exhibitions
have
done
much
to
improve
the
agricultural
interests
and
have
led
to
better
and
more
productive
methods
of
cultivation
than
were
formerly
practiced
in
the
province
the
farmer
gradually
became
a
wealthy
and
intelligent
landowner
proud
of
his
improved
flocks
and
herds
of
his
fine
horses
and
handsome
homestead
he
was
able
to
send
his
sons
to
college
and
his
daughters
to
boarding
school
and
not
uncommonly
became
an
honourable
member
of
the
legislative
council
while
the
sons
of
poor
gentlemen
have
generally
lost
caste
and
sunk
into
useless
sots
the
children
of
these
honest
tillers
of
the
soil
have
steadily
risen
to
the
highest
class
and
have
given
to
canada
some
of
her
best
and
wisest
legislators
men
who
rest
satisfied
with
the
mere
accident
of
birth
for
their
claims
to
distinction
without
energy
and
industry
to
maintain
their
position
in
society
are
sadly
at
discount
in
a
country
which
amply
rewards
the
worker
but
leaves
the
indolent
loafer
to
die
in
indigence
and
obscurity
honest
poverty
is
encouraged
not
despised
in
canada
few
of
her
prosperous
men
have
risen
from
obscurity
to
affluence
without
going
through
the
mill
and
therefore
have
a
for
those
who
are
struggling
to
gain
the
first
rung
on
the
ladder
men
are
allowed
in
this
country
a
freedom
enjoyed
by
few
of
the
more
polished
countries
in
europe
freedom
in
religion
politics
and
speech
freedom
to
select
their
own
friends
and
to
visit
with
whom
they
please
without
consulting
the
grundys
of
society
and
they
can
lead
a
more
independent
social
life
than
in
the
mother
country
because
less
restricted
by
the
conventional
prejudices
that
govern
older
communities
few
people
who
have
lived
many
years
in
canada
and
return
to
england
to
spend
the
remainder
of
their
days
accomplish
the
fact
they
almost
invariably
come
back
and
why
they
feel
more
independent
and
happier
here
they
have
no
idea
what
a
blessed
country
it
is
to
live
in
until
they
go
back
and
realize
the
want
of
social
freedom
i
have
heard
this
from
so
many
educated
people
persons
of
taste
and
refinement
that
i
can
not
doubt
the
truth
of
their
statements
forty
years
has
accomplished
as
great
a
change
in
the
habits
and
tastes
of
the
canadian
people
as
it
has
in
the
architecture
of
their
fine
cities
and
the
appearance
of
the
country
a
young
canadian
gentleman
is
as
well
educated
as
any
of
his
compeers
across
the
big
water
and
contrasts
very
favourably
with
them
social
and
unaffected
he
puts
on
no
airs
of
offensive
superiority
but
meets
a
stranger
with
the
courtesy
and
frankness
best
calculated
to
shorten
the
distance
between
them
and
to
make
his
guest
feel
perfectly
at
home
few
countries
possess
a
more
beautiful
female
population
the
women
are
elegant
in
their
tastes
graceful
in
their
manners
and
naturally
kind
and
affectionate
in
their
dispositions
good
housekeepers
sociable
neighbours
and
lively
and
active
in
speech
and
movement
they
are
capital
companions
and
make
excellent
wives
and
mothers
of
course
there
must
be
exceptions
to
every
rule
but
cases
of
divorce
or
desertion
of
their
homes
are
so
rare
an
occurrence
that
it
speaks
volumes
for
their
domestic
worth
numbers
of
british
officers
have
chosen
their
wives
in
canada
and
i
never
heard
that
they
had
cause
to
repent
of
their
choice
in
common
with
our
american
neighbours
we
find
that
the
worst
members
of
our
community
are
not
canadian
born
but
importations
from
other
countries
the
dominion
and
local
governments
are
now
doing
much
to
open
up
the
resources
of
canada
by
the
intercolonial
and
projected
pacific
railways
and
other
public
works
which
in
time
will
make
a
vast
tract
of
land
available
for
cultivation
and
furnish
homes
for
multitudes
of
the
starving
populations
of
europe
and
again
the
government
of
the
flourishing
province
of
ontario
of
which
the
hon
sandfield
macdonald
is
premier
has
done
wonders
during
the
last
four
years
by
means
of
its
immigration
policy
which
has
been
most
successfully
carried
out
by
the
hon
john
carling
the
commissioner
and
greatly
tended
to
the
development
of
the
country
by
this
policy
liberal
provision
is
made
for
free
grants
of
land
to
actual
settlers
for
general
education
and
for
the
encouragement
of
the
industrial
arts
and
agriculture
by
the
construction
of
public
roads
and
the
improvement
of
the
internal
navigable
waters
of
the
province
and
by
the
assistance
now
given
to
an
economical
system
of
railways
connecting
these
interior
waters
with
the
leading
railroads
and
ports
on
the
frontier
and
not
only
are
free
grants
of
land
given
in
the
districts
extending
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
extremity
of
the
province
but
one
of
the
best
of
the
new
townships
has
been
selected
in
which
the
government
is
now
making
roads
and
upon
each
lot
is
clearing
five
acres
and
erecting
thereon
a
small
house
which
will
be
granted
to
heads
of
families
who
by
six
annual
instalments
will
be
required
to
pay
back
to
the
government
the
cost
of
these
improvements
not
exceeding
or
pounds
sterling
when
a
free
patent
or
deed
of
the
land
will
be
given
without
any
charge
whatever
under
a
protective
homestead
act
this
wise
and
liberal
policy
would
have
astonished
the
colonial
legislature
of
but
will
no
doubt
speedily
give
to
the
province
a
noble
and
progressive
back
country
and
add
much
to
its
strength
and
prosperity
our
busy
factories
and
foundries
our
copper
silver
and
plumbago
mines
our
salt
and
petroleum
the
increasing
exports
of
native
produce
speak
volumes
for
the
prosperity
of
the
dominion
and
for
the
government
of
those
who
are
at
the
head
of
affairs
it
only
requires
the
loyal
of
an
intelligent
and
enlightened
people
to
render
this
beautiful
and
free
country
the
greatest
and
the
happiest
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
when
we
contrast
forest
life
in
canada
forty
years
ago
with
the
present
state
of
the
country
my
book
will
not
be
without
interest
and
significance
we
may
truly
say
old
things
have
passed
away
all
things
have
become
new
what
an
advance
in
the
arts
and
sciences
and
in
the
literature
of
the
country
has
been
made
during
the
last
few
years
canada
can
boast
of
many
good
and
even
distinguished
authors
and
the
love
of
books
and
booklore
is
daily
increasing
institues
and
literary
associations
for
the
encouragement
of
learning
are
now
to
be
found
in
all
the
cities
and
large
towns
in
the
dominion
we
are
no
longer
dependent
upon
the
states
for
the
reproduction
of
the
works
of
celebrated
authors
our
own
publishers
both
in
toronto
and
montreal
are
furnishing
our
handsome
bookstores
with
volumes
that
rival
in
cheapness
and
typographical
excellence
the
best
issues
from
the
large
printing
establishments
in
america
we
have
no
lack
of
native
talent
or
books
or
of
intelligent
readers
to
appreciate
them
our
print
shops
are
full
of
the
designs
of
native
artists
and
the
grand
scenery
of
our
lakes
and
forests
transferred
to
canvas
adorns
the
homes
of
our
wealthy
citizens
we
must
not
omit
in
this
slight
sketch
to
refer
to
the
number
of
fine
public
buildings
which
meet
us
at
every
turn
most
of
which
have
been
designed
and
executed
by
native
architects
montreal
can
point
to
her
victoria
bridge
and
challenge
the
world
to
produce
its
equal
this
prodigy
of
mechanical
skill
should
be
a
sufficient
inducement
to
strangers
from
other
lands
to
visit
our
shores
and
though
designed
by
the
son
of
the
immortal
george
stephenson
it
was
canadian
hands
that
helped
him
to
execute
his
great
project
to
raise
that
glorious
monument
to
his
fame
which
we
hope
will
outlast
a
thousand
years
our
new
houses
of
parliment
our
churches
banks
public
halls
asylums
for
the
insane
the
blind
and
the
deaf
and
dumb
are
buildings
which
must
attract
the
attention
of
every
intelligent
traveller
and
when
we
consider
the
few
brief
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
upper
province
was
reclaimed
from
the
wilderness
our
progress
in
mechanical
arts
and
all
the
comforts
which
pertain
to
modern
civilization
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
older
nations
if
the
canadian
people
will
honestly
unite
in
carrying
out
measures
proposed
by
the
government
for
the
good
of
the
country
irrespective
of
and
party
prejudices
they
must
before
the
close
of
the
present
century
become
a
great
and
prosperous
nationality
may
the
blessing
of
god
rest
upon
canada
and
the
canadian
people

this
chapter
was
originally
intended
by
moodie
for
inclusion
in
the
first
edition
of
roughing
it
in
the
bush
but
was
instead
published
in
the
periodical

in

it
was
later
revised
and
included
in
the
book

by
the
same
author
ah
human
hearts
are
strangely
cast
time
softens
grief
and
pain
like
reeds
that
shiver
in
the
blast
they
bend
to
rise
again
but
she
in
silence
bowed
her
head
to
none
her
sorrow
would
impart

faithful
arms
enclose
the
dead
and
hide
for

her
broken
heart
our
man
james
came
to
me
to
request
the
loan
of
one
of
the
horses
to
attend
a
funeral
m
was
absent
on
business
and
the
horses
and
the
man
time
were
both
greatly
needed
to
prepare
the
land
for
the
fall
crops
i
demurred
james
looked
anxious
and
disappointed
and
the
loan
of
the
horse
was
at
length
granted
but
not
without
a
strict
injunction
that
he
should
return
to
his
work
the
moment
the
funeral
was
over
he
did
not
come
back
until
late
that
evening
i
had
just
finished
my
tea
and
was
nursing
my
wrath
at
his
staying
out
the
whole
day
when
the
door
of
the
room
we
had
but
one
and
that
was
shared
in
common
with
the
servants
opened
and
the
delinquent
at
last
appeared
he
hung
up
the
new
english
saddle
and
sat
down
by
the
blazing
hearth
without
speaking
a
word
what
detained
you
so
long
james
you
ought
to
have
had
half
an
acre
of

nane
o

my
life
as
i
ha
dune
this
day
i
ha
seen
the
clods
piled
on
mony
a
heid
and
never

the
saut

puir
jeanie
puir

it
was
a
sair
sight
to
see

upon
my
curiosity

excited
i
pushed

told

naething
for
me
the
night
bell
i
canna

my
thoughts
will
rin
on
that
puir
lass
sae
young
sae
bonnie
an
a
few
months
ago
as
blythe
as
a
lark
an
now
a
clod
o
the
earth
hout
we
maun
all
dee
when
our
ain
time
comes
but
somehow
i
canna
think
that
jeanie
ought
to
ha
gane
sae
who
is
jeanie
burns
tell
me
james
something
about
in
compliance
with
my
request
the
man
gave
me
the
following
story
i
wish
i
could
convey
it
in
his
own
words
but
though
i
can
perfectly
understand
the
scotch
dialect
when
spoken
i
could
not
write
it
in
its
charming
simplicity
that
honest
truthful
brevity
which
is
so
characteristic
of
this
noble
people
the
smooth
tones
of
the
blarney
may
flatter
our
vanity
and
please
us
for
the
moment
but
who
places
any
confidence
in
those
by
whom
it
is
employed
we
know
that
it
is
only
uttered
to
cajole
and
deceive
and
when
the
novelty
wears
off
the
repetition
awakens
indignation
and
disgust
but
who
mistrusts
the
blunt
straightforward
speech
of
the
land
of
burns
for
good
or
ill
it
strikes
home
to
the
heart
jeanie
burns
was
the
daughter
of
a
respectable
shoemaker
who
gained
a
comfortable
living
by
his
trade
in
a
small
town
in
ayrshire
her
father
like
herself
was
an
only
child
and
followed
the
same
vocation
and
wrought
under
the
same
roof
that
his
father
had
done
before
him
the
elder
burns
had
met
with
many
reverses
and
now
helpless
and
blind
was
entirely
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
his
son
honest
jock
had
not
married
until
late
in
life
that
he
might
more
comfortably
provide
for
the
wants
of
his
aged
parent
his
mother
had
been
dead
for
some
years
she
was
a
meek
pious
woman
and
jock
quaintly
affirmed
it
had
pleased
the
lord
to
provide
a
better
inheritance
for
his
dear
auld
mither
than
his
arm
could
win
proud
and
happy
as
he
would
have
been
to
have
supported
her
when
she
was
no
longer
able
to
work
for
him
jock
paternal
love
was
repaid
at
last
chance
threw
in
his
way
a
cannie
young
lass
baith
guid
and
bonnie
they
were
united
and
jeanie
was
the
sole
fruit
of
this
marriage
but
jeanie
proved
a
host
in
herself
and
grew
up
the
best
natured
the
prettiest
and
the
most
industrious
lass
in
the
village
and
was
a
general
favourite
both
with
young
and
old
she
helped
her
mother
in
the
house
bound
shoes
for
her
father
and
attended
to
all
the
wants
of
her
dear
old
grandfather
saunders
burns
who
was
so
much
attached
to
his
little
handmaid
that
he
was
never
happy
when
she
was
absent
happiness
is
not
a
flower
of
long
growth
in
this
world
it
requires
the
dew
and
sunlight
of
heaven
to
nourish
it
and
it
soon
withers
removed
from
its
native
skies
the
cholera
visited
the
remote
village
it
smote
the
strong
man
in
the
pride
of
his
strength
and
the
matron
in
the
beauty
of
her
prime
while
it
spared
the
helpless
and
the
aged
the
infant
of
a
few
days
and
the
parent
of
many
years
both
jeanie
parents
fell
victims
to
the
fatal
disease
and
the
old
blind
saunders
and
the
young
jeanie
were
left
to
fight
alone
a
hard
battle
with
poverty
and
grief
the
truly
deserving
are
never
entirely
forsaken
god
may
afflict
them
with
many
trials
but
he
watches
over
them
still
and
often
provides
for
their
wants
in
a
manner
truly
miraculous
sympathizing
friends
gathered
round
the
orphan
girl
in
her
hour
of
need
and
obtained
for
her
sufficient
employment
to
enable
her
to
support
her
old
grandfather
and
herself
and
provide
for
them
the
common
necessaries
of
life
jeannie
was
an
excellent
sempstress
and
what
between
making
waistcoats
and
trousers
for
the
tailors
and
binding
shoes
for
the
shoemakers
a
business
that
she
thoroughly
understood
she
soon
had
her
little
hired
room
neatly
furnished
and
her
grandfather
as
clean
and
spruce
as
ever
when
she
led
him
into
the
kirk
of
a
sabbath
morning
all
the
neighbours
greeted
the
dutiful
daughter
with
an
approving
smile
and
the
old
man
looked
so
serene
and
happy
that
jeanie
was
fully
repaid
for
her
labours
of
love
her
industry
and
piety
often
formed
the
theme
of
conversation
to
the
young
lads
of
the
village
a
guid
wife
jeanie

of
who
has

willie
robertson

with
a
sigh

na
covet
the

o
the

world
an
she
were
mine
willie
was
a
fine
active
young
man
who
bore
an
excellent
character
and
his
comrades
thought
it
very
likely
that
willie
was
to
be
the
fortunate
man
robertson
was
the
youngest
son
of
a
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
no
land
of
his
own
and
he
was
one
of
a
very
large
family
from
a
boy
he
had
assisted
his
father
in
working
the
farm
for
their
common
maintenance
but
after
he
took
to
looking
at
jeanie
burns
at
kirk
instead
of
minding
his
prayers
he
began
to
wish
that
he
had
a
homestead
of
his
own
which
he
could
ask
jeanie
and
her
grandfather
to
share
he
made
his
wishes
known
to
his
father
the
old
man
was
prudent
a
marriage
with
jeanie
burns
offered
no
advantages
in
a
pecuniary
view
but
the
girl
was
a
good
honest
girl
of
whom
any
man
might
be
proud
he
had
himself
married
for
love
and
had
enjoyed
great
comfort
in
his
wife
my
lad
he
said
canna
ye
a
share
o
the
farm
it
is
ower
sma
for
the
mony
mouths
it
has
to
feed
i
laid
by
a
little
siller
for
a
rainy
day
an
this
i
will
ye
to
win
a
farm
for
yersel
in
the
woods
o
canada
there
is
plenty
o
room
there
an
industry
brings
its
ain
reward
if
jeanie
burns
you
as
weel
as
yer
dear
mither
did
me
she
will
be
fain
to
follow
you
there
willie
grasped
his
father
hand
for
he
was
too
much
elated
to
speak
and
he
ran
away
to
tell
his
tale
of
love
to
the
girl
of
his
heart
jeanie
had
long
loved
robertson
in
secret
and
they
were
not
long
in
settling
the
matter
they
forgot
in
their
first
moments
of
joy
that
old
saunders
had
to
be
consulted
for
they
had
determined
to
take
the
old
man
with
them
but
here
an
obstacle
occurred
of
which
they
had
not
dreamed
old
age
is
selfish
and
saunders
obstinately
refused
to
comply
with
their
wishes
the
grave
that
held
the
remains
of
his
wife
and
son
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
comforts
promised
to
him
by
the
impatient
lovers
in
that
far
foreign
land
jeanie
wept
but
saunders
deaf
and
blind
neither
heard
nor
saw
her
grief
and
like
a
dutiful
child
she
breathed
no
complaint
to
him
but
promised
to
remain
with
him
until
his
head
rested
upon
the
same
pillow
with
the
dead
this
was
a
sore
and
great
trial
to
willie
robertson
but
he
consoled
himself
for
his
disappointment
with
the
thought
that
saunders
could
not
live
long
and
that
he
would
go
and
prepare
a
place
for
his
jean
and
have
everything
ready
for
her
reception
against
the
old
man
died
was
a
cousin
of
willie
continued
james
the
side
and
he
persuaded
me
to
accompany
him
to
canada
we
set
sail
the
first
day
of
may
and
were
here
in
time
to
chop
a
small
fallow
for
a
fall
crop
willie
robertson
had
more
of
this
world
gear
than
i
for
his
father
had
provided
him
with
sufficient
funds
to
purchase
a
good
lot
of
wild
land
which
he
did
in
the
township
of
m
and
i
was
to
work
with
him
on
shares
we
were
one
of
the
first
settlers
in
that
place
and
we
found
the
work
before
us
rough
and
hard
to
our
heart
content
but
willie
had
a
strong
motive
for
exertion
and
never
did
man
work
harder
than
he
did
that
first
year
on
his
for
the
love
of
jeanie
burns
we
built
a
comfortable
in
which
we
were
assisted
by
the
few
neighbours
we
had
who
likewise
lent
a
hand
in
clearing
ten
acres
we
had
chopped
for
fall
crop
all
this
time
willie
kept
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
jeanie
burns
and
he
used
to
talk
to
me
of
her
coming
out
and
his
future
plans
every
night
when
our
work
was
done
if
i
had
not
loved
and
respected
the
girl
mysel
i
should
have
got
unco
tired
o
the
subject
we
had
just
put
in
our
first
crop
of
wheat
when
a
letter
came
from
jeanie
bringing
us
the
news
of
her
grandfather
death
weel
i
ken
the
word
that
willie
spak
to
me
when
he
closed
that
letter
the
auld
man
is
gane
at
last
an
god
me
i
feel
too
gladsome
to
greet
jeanie
is
willin
to
come
whenever
i
the
means
to
bring
her
out
an
hout
man
i
jist
thinkin
that
she
winna
to
wait
lang
good
workmen
were
getting
very
high
wages
just
then
and
willie
left
the
care
of
the
place
to
me
and
hired
for
three
months
with
auld
squire
jones
he
was
an
excellent
teamster
and
could
put
his
hand
to
any
sort
of
work
when
his
term
of
service
expired
he
sent
jeanie
forty
dollars
to
pay
her
passage
out
which
he
hoped
she
would
not
delay
longer
than
the
spring
he
got
an
answer
from
jeanie
full
of
love
and
gratitude
but
she
thought
that
her
voyage
might
be
delayed
until
the
fall
the
good
woman
with
whom
she
had
lodged
since
her
parents
died
had
just
lost
her
husband
and
was
in
a
bad
state
of
health
and
she
begged
jeanie
to
stay
with
her
until
her
daughter
could
leave
her
service
in
edinburgh
and
come
to
take
charge
of
the
house
this
person
had
been
a
kind
and
steadfast
friend
to
jeanie
in
all
her
troubles
and
had
helped
her
nurse
the
old
man
in
his
dying
illness
i
am
sure
it
was
just
like
jeanie
to
act
as
she
did
she
had
all
her
life
looked
more
to
the
comforts
of
others
than
to
her
ain
but
robertson
was
an
angry
man
when
he
got
that
letter
and
he
said
that
was
the
that
jeanie
burns
had
for
him
to
prefer
an
auld
comfort
who
was
naething
to
her
to
her
betrothed
husband
she
might
bide
awa
as
lang
as
she
pleased
he
would
never
trouble
himsel
to
write
to
her
again
i
did
na
think
that
the
man
was
in
earnest
an
i
remonstrated
with
him
on
his
folly
an
injustice
this
ended
in
a
sharp
quarrel
atween
us
and
i
left
him
to
gang
his
ain
gate
an
went
to
live
with
my
uncle
who
kept
a
blacksmith
forge
in
the
village
after
a
while
we
heard
that
willie
robertson
was
married
to
a
canadian
woman
neither
young
nor
and
very
much
his
inferior
in
every
way
but
she
had
a
good
lot
of
land
in
the
rear
of
his
farm
of
course
i
thought
that
it
was
all
broken
off
with
puir
jeanie
and
i
wondered
what
she
would
spier
at
the
marriage
it
was
early
in
june
and
our
canadian
woods
were
in
their
first
flush
o
green
an
how
green
an
lightsome
they
be
in
their
spring
dress
when
jeanie
burns
landed
in
canada
she
travelled
her
lane
up
the
country
wondering
why
willie
was
not
at
montreal
to
meet
her
as
he
had
promised
in
the
last
letter
he
sent
her
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
brought
her
to
c
and
without
waiting
to
ask
any
questions
respecting
him
she
hired
a
man
and
cart
to
take
her
and
her
luggage
to
m
the
road
through
the
bush
was
very
heavy
and
it
was
night
before
they
reached
clearing
and
with
some
difficulty
the
driver
found
his
way
among
the
logs
to
the
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
the
wife
a
coarse
slattern
came
out
to
see
what
could
bring
strangers
to
such
an
place
at
that
late
hour
puir
jeanie
i
can
weel
imagine
the
fluttering
o
her
heart
when
she
spier
of
the
woman
for
ane
willie
robertson
and
asked
if
he
was
at
hame
answered
the
wife
gruffly
he
is
not
in
from
the
fallow
yet
you
may
see
him
up
yonder
tending
the
blazing
logs
while
jeanie
was
striving
to
look
in
the
direction
which
the
woman
pointed
out
and
could
na
see
through
the
tears
that
blinded
her
the
driver
jumped
down
from
the
cart
and
asked
the
puir
girl
where
he
should
leave
her
trunks
as
it
was
getting
late
and
he
must
be
off
need
not
bring
these
big
chests
in
here
said
robertson
have
no
room
in
my
house
for
strangers
and
their
luggage
house
gasped
jeanie
catching
her
arm
ye
na
tell
me
that
lived
here
and
wherever
willie
robertson
bides
jeanie
burns
sud
be
a
welcome
guest
tell
him
she
continued
trembling
all
ower
for
she
told
me
afterwards
that
there
was
something
in
the
woman
look
and
tone
that
made
the
cold
chills
run
to
her
heart
an
auld
friend
from
scotland
has
jist
come
off
a
lang
wearisome
journey
to
see
him
may
speak
for
yourself
cried
the
woman
angrily
my
husband
is
now
coming
down
the
clearing
the
word
husband
was
scarcely
out
o
her
mouth
than
puir
jeanie
fell
as
ane
dead
across
the
the
driver
lifted
up
the
unfortunate
girl
carried
her
into
the
cabin
and
placed
her
in
a
chair
regardless
of
the
opposition
of
robertson
whose
jealousy
was
now
fairly
aroused
and
who
declared
that
the
bold
huzzie
should
not
enter
her
doors
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
driver
succeeded
in
bringing
jeanie
to
herself
and
she
had
only
just
unclosed
her
eyes
when
willie
came
in
he
said
cart
is
this
standing
at
the
door
and
what
do
these
people
want
here
know
best
cried
the
angry
woman
bursting
into
tears
creature
is
no
acquaintance
of
mine
and
if
she
is
suffered
to
remain
here
i
will
leave
the
house
at
once
me
gude
woman
for
having
unwittingly
offended
ye
said
jeanie
rising
merciful
father
how
sud
i
ken
that
willie
robertson
my
ain
willie
had
a
wife
oh
willie
she
cried
covering
her
face
in
her
hands
to
hide
all
the
agony
that
was
in
her
heart
ha
come
a
lang
way
an
a
weary
to
see
ye
an
ye
might
ha
spared
me
the
grief
the
burning
shame
o
this
farewell
willie
robertson
i
will
never
mair
trouble
ye
nor
her
wi
my
presence
but
this
cruel
deed
of
yours
has
broken
my
heart
she
went
away
weeping
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
detain
her
or
say
one
word
to
comfort
her
or
account
for
his
strange
conduct
yet
if
i
know
him
right
that
must
ha
been
the
most
moment
in
his
life
jeanie
was
a
distant
connexion
of
my
uncle
and
she
found
us
out
that
night
on
her
return
to
the
village
and
told
us
all
her
grief
my
aunt
who
was
a
kind
good
woman
was
indignant
at
the
treatment
she
had
received
and
loved
and
cherished
her
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
child
for
two
whole
weeks
she
kept
her
bed
and
was
so
ill
that
the
doctor
despaired
of
her
life
and
when
she
did
come
again
among
us
the
colour
had
faded
from
her
cheeks
and
the
light
from
her
sweet
blue
eyes
and
she
spoke
in
a
low
subdued
voice
but
she
never
spoke
of
as
the
cause
of
her
grief
one
day
she
called
me
aside
and
said
you
know
how
i
an
trusted
an
obeyed
his
ain
wishes
in
comin
out
to
this
strange
country
to
be
his
wife
but
all
over
now
and
she
pressed
her
sma
hands
tightly
over
her
breast
to
keep
doon
the
swelling
o
her
heart
i
know
now
that
it
is
a
for
the
best
i
him
too
weel
mair
than
ony
creature
sud
a
perishing
thing
o
earth
but
i
thought
that
he
wud
be
sae
glad
an
sae
proud
to
see
his
ain
jeanie
sae
sune
but
oh
ah
weel
i
maun
na
think
o
that
what
i
wud
jist
say
is
this
an
she
took
a
sma
packet
fra
her
breast
while
the
tears
streamed
down
her
pale
cheeks
sent
me
forty
dollars
to
bring
me
ower
the
sea
to
him
god
bless
him
for
that
i
ken
he
worked
hard
to
earn
it
for
he
me
then
i
was
na
idle
during
his
absence
i
had
saved
enough
to
bury
my
dear
auld
grandfather
and
to
pay
my
ain
expenses
out
and
i
thought
like
the
gude
servant
in
the
parable
i
wud
return
willie
his
ain
with
interest
an
i
hoped
to
see
him
smile
at
my
diligence
an
ca
me
his
bonnie
gude
lassie
jamie
i
canna
keep
this
siller
it
lies
like
a
weight
lead
on
my
heart
tak
it
back
to
him
an
tell
him
fra
me
that
i
him
a
his
cruel
deceit
an
pray
to
god
to
grant
him
prosperity
and
restore
to
him
that
peace
o
mind
o
which
he
has
robbed
me
for
ever
i
did
as
she
bade
me
willie
looked
stupified
when
i
delivered
her
message
the
only
remark
he
made
when
i
gave
him
back
the
money
was
maun
be
gratefu
man
that
she
did
na
curse
me
the
wife
came
in
and
he
hid
away
the
packet
and
slunk
off
the
man
looked
degraded
in
his
own
eyes
and
so
wretched
that
i
pitied
him
from
my
very
heart
when
i
came
home
jeanie
met
me
at
my
uncle
gate
me
she
said
in
a
low
anxious
voice
me
cousin
jamie
what
passed
atween
ye
had
he
nae
word
for
me
jeanie
the
man
is
lost
to
himsel
to
a
who
ance
wished
him
weel
he
is
not
worth
a
decent
body
thought
she
sighed
deeply
for
i
saw
that
her
heart
craved
after
some
word
fra
him
but
she
said
nae
mair
but
pale
an
sorrowfu
the
very
ghaist
o
her
former
sel
went
back
into
the
house
from
that
hour
she
never
breathed
his
name
to
ony
of
us
but
we
all
ken
that
it
was
her
love
for
him
that
was
preying
upon
her
life
the
grief
that
has
nae
voice
like
the
always
lies
to
the
heart
puir
jeanie
she
held
out
during
the
simmer
but
when
the
fall
came
she
just
withered
awa
like
a
flower
nipped
by
the
early
frost
and
this
day
we
laid
her
in
the
earth
after
the
funeral
was
ower
and
the
mourners
were
all
gone
i
stood
beside
her
grave
thinking
ower
the
days
of
my
boyhood
when
she
and
i
were
happy
weans
an
used
to
pu
the
gowans
together
on
the
heathery
hills
o
dear
auld
scotland
an
i
tried
in
vain
to
understan
the
mysterious
providence
o
god
who
had
stricken
her
who
seemed
sae
gude
and
pure
an
spared
the
like
o
me
who
was
mair
deservin
o
his
wrath
when
i
heard
a
deep
groan
an
i
saw
willie
robertson
standing
near
me
beside
the
grave
may
as
weel
spare
your
grief
noo
said
i
for
i
felt
hard
towards
him
rejoice
that
the
weary
is
at
rest
was
i
murdered
her
said
he
the
thought
will
haunt
me
to
my
last
day
did
she
remember
me
on
her
death
bed
thoughts
were
only
ken
by
him
who
reads
the
secrets
of
hearts
willie
her
end
was
peace
an
her
saviour
blessed
name
was
the
last
sound
upon
her
lips
but
if
ever
woman
died
fra
a
broken
heart
there
she
lies
jeanie
he
cried
ain
darling
jeanie
my
blessed
lammie
i
was
na
worthy
o
yer
love
my
heart
too
is
breaking
to
bring
ye
back
aince
mair
i
wad
lay
me
down
an
dee
an
he
flung
himsel
upon
the
grave
and
embraced
the
fresh
clods
and
greeted
like
a
child
when
he
grew
more
calm
we
had
a
long
conversation
about
the
past
and
truly
i
believe
that
the
man
was
not
in
his
right
senses
when
he
married
yon
wife
at
ony
rate
he
is
not
lang
for
this
warld
he
has
fretted
the
flesh
aff
his
banes
an
before
many
months
are
ower
his
heid
will
lie
as
low
as
puir
jeanie
while
i
was
pondering
this
sad
story
in
my
mind
h
came
in
you
have
heard
the
news
m
i
looked
inquiringly
one
of
clark
little
boys
that
were
lost
last
wednesday
in
the
woods
has
been
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
about
it
how
were
they
lost
oh
is
a
thing
of
very
common
occurrence
here
new
settlers
who
are
ignorant
of
the
danger
of
going
astray
in
the
forest
are
always
having
their
children
lost
this
is
not
the
first
instance
by
many
that
i
have
known
having
myself
lived
for
many
years
in
the
bush
i
only
wonder
that
it
does
not
more
frequently
happen
these
little
fellows
are
the
sons
of
a
poor
man
who
came
out
this
summer
and
who
has
taken
up
some
wild
land
about
a
mile
back
of
us
towards
the
plains
clark
is
busy
logging
up
a
small
fallow
for
fall
wheat
on
which
his
family
must
depend
for
bread
during
the
ensuing
year
and
he
is
so
anxious
to
get
it
ready
in
time
that
he
will
not
allow
himself
an
hour
at
noon
to
go
home
to
his
dinner
which
his
wife
generally
sends
in
a
basket
to
the
woods
by
his
eldest
daughter
last
wednesday
the
girl
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
by
her
mother
who
thought
in
her
absence
that
she
might
venture
to
trust
the
two
boys
to
take
the
dinner
to
their
father
the
boys
were
from
seven
to
five
years
old
and
very
smart
and
knowing
for
their
age
they
promised
to
mind
all
her
directions
and
went
off
quite
proud
of
the
task
carrying
the
basket
between
them
how
they
came
to
ramble
away
into
the
woods
the
younger
child
is
too
much
stupified
to
tell
and
perhaps
he
is
too
young
to
remember
at
night
the
father
returned
and
scolded
the
wife
for
not
sending
his
dinner
as
usual
but
the
poor
woman
who
all
day
had
quieted
her
fears
with
the
belief
that
the
children
had
stayed
with
their
father
instead
of
paying
any
regard
to
his
angry
words
demanded
in
a
tone
of
agony
what
had
become
of
her
children
tired
and
hungry
as
clark
was
in
a
moment
he
comprehended
their
danger
and
started
off
in
pursuit
of
the
boys
the
shrieks
of
the
distracted
woman
soon
called
the
neighbours
together
who
instantly
joined
in
the
search
it
was
not
until
this
afternoon
that
any
trace
could
be
obtained
of
the
lost
children
when
brian
the
hunter
found
the
youngest
boy
johnnie
lying
fast
asleep
upon
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
fifteen
miles
back
in
the
and
the
other
boy
will
never
i
fear
be
heard
of
again
said
she
they
have
searched
for
him
in
all
directions
and
have
not
discovered
him
the
story
little
johnnie
tells
is
to
this
effect
during
the
first
two
days
of
their
absence
the
food
they
had
brought
in
the
basket
for
their
father
dinner
sustained
life
but
it
seems
that
the
little
johnnie
grew
very
hungry
and
cried
continually
for
bread
william
the
elder
boy
he
says
promised
him
bread
if
he
would
try
and
walk
further
but
his
feet
were
bleeding
and
sore
and
he
could
not
stir
another
step
william
told
him
to
sit
down
upon
the
log
on
which
he
was
found
and
not
stir
from
the
place
until
he
came
back
and
he
would
run
on
until
he
found
a
house
and
brought
him
something
to
eat
he
then
wiped
his
eyes
and
bade
him
not
to
be
frightened
or
to
cry
and
kissed
him
and
went
away
this
is
all
the
little
fellow
knows
about
his
brother
and
it
is
very
probable
the
boy
has
been
eaten
by
the
wolves
the
indians
traced
him
for
more
than
a
mile
along
the
banks
of
a
stream
when
they
lost
his
trail
altogether
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
water
they
would
have
discovered
his
body
but
they
say
that
he
has
been
dragged
into
some
hole
in
the
bank
among
the
tangled
cedars
and
devoured
since
i
have
been
in
the
country
continued
h
i
have
known
many
cases
of
children
and
even
of
grown
persons
being
lost
in
the
woods
who
were
never
heard
of
again
it
is
a
frightful
calamity
to
happen
to
any
one
and
mothers
can
not
be
too
careful
in
guarding
their
children
against
rambling
alone
into
the
bush
persons
when
once
they
lose
sight
of
the
beaten
track
get
frightened
and
bewildered
and
lose
all
presence
of
mind
and
instead
of
remaining
where
they
are
which
is
their
only
chance
of
being
discovered
they
plunge
desperately
on
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
hope
of
getting
out
while
they
only
involve
themselves
more
deeply
among
the
mazes
of
the
interminable
forest
two
winters
ago
the
daughter
of
a
settler
in
the
remote
township
of
dummer
where
my
husband
took
up
his
grant
of
wild
land
went
with
her
father
to
the
mill
which
was
four
miles
from
their
log
shanty
and
the
road
lay
entirely
through
the
bush
for
a
while
the
girl
who
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
kept
up
with
her
father
who
walked
briskly
ahead
with
his
bag
of
corn
on
his
back
for
as
their
path
lay
through
a
tangled
swamp
he
was
anxious
to
get
home
before
night
after
a
time
sarah
grew
tired
and
lagged
a
long
way
behind
the
man
felt
not
the
least
apprehensive
when
he
lost
sight
of
her
expecting
that
she
would
soon
come
up
with
him
again
once
or
twice
he
stopped
and
shouted
and
she
answered
father
and
he
did
not
turn
to
look
after
her
again
he
reached
the
mill
saw
the
grist
ground
resumed
his
burthen
and
took
the
road
home
expecting
to
meet
sarah
by
the
way
he
trod
the
path
alone
but
still
thought
that
the
girl
tired
of
the
long
walk
had
turned
back
and
that
he
should
find
her
safe
at
home
you
may
imagine
m
his
consternation
and
that
of
the
family
when
they
found
that
the
girl
was
lost
it
was
now
dark
and
all
search
for
her
was
given
up
for
the
night
as
hopeless
by
the
next
morning
the
whole
settlement
which
was
then
confined
to
a
few
lonely
log
tenements
inhabited
by
cornish
miners
were
roused
from
their
sleep
to
assist
in
the
search
the
men
turned
out
with
guns
and
arms
and
parties
started
in
different
directions
those
who
first
discovered
the
girl
were
to
fire
their
guns
which
was
to
be
the
signal
to
guide
the
rest
to
the
spot
it
was
not
long
before
they
found
the
object
of
their
search
seated
under
a
tree
about
half
a
mile
from
the
path
she
had
lost
on
the
preceding
day
she
had
been
tempted
by
the
beauty
of
some
wild
berries
to
leave
the
road
and
when
once
in
the
bush
she
grew
bewildered
and
could
not
find
her
way
back
at
first
she
ran
to
and
fro
in
an
agony
of
terror
at
finding
herself
in
the
woods
all
alone
and
uttered
loud
and
frantic
cries
but
her
father
had
by
this
time
reached
the
mill
and
was
out
of
hearing
with
a
sagacity
beyond
her
years
and
not
very
common
to
her
class
instead
of
wandering
further
into
the
labyrinth
which
surrounded
her
she
sat
down
under
a
large
tree
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
said
the
lord
prayer
the
only
one
she
knew
and
hoped
that
god
would
send
her
father
back
to
find
her
the
moment
he
discovered
that
she
was
lost
when
night
came
down
upon
the
dark
forest
and
oh
how
dark
night
is
in
the
woods
the
poor
girl
said
that
she
felt
horribly
afraid
of
being
eaten
by
the
wolves
which
abound
in
those
dreary
swamps
but
she
did
not
cry
for
fear
they
should
hear
her
simple
girl
she
did
not
know
that
the
scent
of
a
wolf
is
far
keener
that
his
ear
but
that
was
her
notion
and
she
lay
down
close
to
the
ground
and
never
once
raised
her
head
for
fear
of
seeing
something
dreadful
standing
beside
her
until
overcome
by
terror
and
fatigue
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
roused
by
the
shrill
braying
of
the
horns
and
the
shouts
of
the
party
who
were
seeking
what
a
dreadful
situation
i
am
sure
that
i
should
not
have
had
the
courage
of
this
poor
girl
but
should
have
died
with
we
do
know
how
much
we
can
bear
m
until
we
are
tried
this
girl
was
more
fortunate
than
a
boy
of
the
same
age
who
was
lost
in
the
same
township
just
as
the
winter
set
in
the
lad
was
sent
by
his
father
an
english
settler
in
company
with
two
boys
of
his
own
age
to
be
measured
for
a
pair
of
shoes
george
desne
who
followed
the
double
employment
of
farmer
and
shoemaker
lived
about
three
miles
from
the
clearing
known
by
the
name
of
the
english
line
after
the
lads
left
the
clearing
their
road
lay
entirely
through
the
bush
but
it
was
a
path
they
had
often
travelled
both
alone
and
with
their
parents
and
they
felt
no
fear
there
had
been
a
slight
fall
of
snow
just
enough
to
cover
the
ground
and
the
day
was
clear
and
frosty
the
boys
in
this
country
always
hail
with
delight
the
first
fall
of
snow
and
they
ran
races
and
slid
over
all
the
shallow
pools
until
they
reached
george
desne
cabin
he
measured
young
brown
for
a
strong
pair
of
winter
boots
and
the
boys
went
on
their
homeward
way
shouting
and
laughing
in
the
glee
of
their
hearts
about
halfway
they
suddenly
missed
their
companion
and
ran
back
nearly
a
mile
to
find
him
not
succeeding
in
this
they
thought
that
he
had
hidden
behind
some
of
the
trees
and
pretended
to
be
lost
in
order
to
frighten
them
and
after
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
receiving
no
answer
they
determined
to
go
home
without
him
they
knew
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
road
and
that
it
was
still
broad
day
and
that
he
could
easily
find
his
way
home
alone
when
his
father
inquired
for
george
they
said
that
he
was
coming
and
went
to
their
respective
homes
night
came
and
the
lad
did
not
return
and
his
parents
began
to
be
alarmed
at
his
absence
brown
went
over
to
the
neighbouring
cabins
and
made
the
lads
tell
him
all
they
knew
about
his
son
they
described
the
place
where
they
first
missed
him
but
they
concluded
that
he
had
either
run
home
before
them
or
gone
back
to
spend
the
night
with
the
young
desnes
who
had
been
very
urgent
for
him
to
stay
this
account
pacified
the
anxious
father
early
the
next
morning
he
went
to
desne
himself
to
bring
home
the
boy
but
the
lad
had
not
been
there
his
mysterious
disappearance
gave
rise
to
a
thousand
strange
surmises
the
whole
settlement
turned
out
in
search
of
the
boy
his
steps
were
traced
from
the
road
a
few
yards
into
the
bush
and
entirely
disappeared
at
the
foot
of
a
large
tree
the
moss
was
rubbed
from
the
trunk
of
the
tree
but
the
tree
was
lofty
and
the
branches
so
far
from
the
ground
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
any
boy
unassisted
to
have
raised
himself
to
such
a
height
there
was
no
track
of
any
animal
all
around
in
the
unbroken
snow
no
shred
of
garment
or
stain
of
blood
that
boy
fate
will
ever
remain
a
great
mystery
for
he
was
never
he
must
have
been
carried
up
that
tree
by
a
bear
and
dragged
down
into
the
hollow
trunk
said
i
if
that
had
been
the
case
there
would
have
been
the
print
of
the
bear
feet
in
the
snow
it
does
not
however
follow
that
the
boy
is
dead
though
it
is
more
than
probable
i
knew
of
a
case
where
two
boys
and
a
girl
were
sent
into
the
woods
by
their
mother
to
fetch
home
the
cows
the
children
were
lost
the
parents
mourned
them
for
dead
for
all
search
for
them
proved
fruitless
and
after
seven
years
the
eldest
son
returned
they
had
been
overtaken
and
carried
off
by
a
party
of
indians
who
belonged
to
a
tribe
inhabiting
the
islands
in
lake
huron
several
hundred
miles
away
from
their
the
girl
as
she
grew
into
woman
married
one
of
the
tribe
the
boys
followed
the
occupation
of
hunters
and
fishers
and
from
their
dress
and
appearance
might
have
passed
for
the
red
sons
of
the
forest
the
eldest
boy
however
never
forgot
the
name
of
his
parent
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
lost
and
took
the
first
opportunity
of
making
his
escape
and
travelling
back
to
the
home
of
his
childhood
when
he
made
himself
known
to
his
mother
who
was
a
widow
but
still
resided
upon
the
same
spot
he
was
so
dark
and
that
she
could
not
believe
that
he
was
her
son
until
he
brought
to
her
mind
a
little
incident
that
forgotten
by
her
had
never
left
his
memory
mother
do
you
remember
saying
to
me
on
that
afternoon
you
need
not
look
for
the
cows
in
the
swamp
they
went
off
towards
the
big
hill
the
delighted
mother
clasped
him
in
her
arms
exclaiming
say
truly
you
are
indeed
my
own
my
long
lost
son
