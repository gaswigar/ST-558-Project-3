he
takes

he
enjoyeth
a
delightful

by
pleasant
rivers
in
sweet
pastures
amongst
odoriferous
flowers
which
gratifie
his
senses
and
delight
his

contentments
induce

wish
in
town
when
tulips
bloom
in

square
and
timid
breaths
of
vernal
air
are
wandering
down
the
dusty
town
like
children
lost
in
vanity
fair
when
every
long
unlovely
row
of
westward
houses
stands
aglow
and
leads
the
eyes
toward
sunset
skies
beyond
the
hills
where
green
trees
grow
then
weary
is
the
street
parade
and
weary
books
and
weary
trade
i
only
wishing
to
go
for
this
the
month
of
may
was
made
i
guess
the
now
are
creeping
out
on
every
bough
along
the
brook
and
robins
look
for
early
worms
behind
the
plough
the
have
changed
their
dun
for
yellow
coats
to
match
the
sun
and
in
the
same
array
of
flame
the
dandelion
show
begun
the
flocks
of
young
anemones
are
dancing
round
the
budding
trees
who
can
help
wishing
to
go
in
days
as
full
of
joy
as
these
i
think
the
clear
sound
leaks
upward
slowly
from
the
ground
while
on
the
wing
the
bluebirds
ring
their
to
woods
around
the
flirting
chewink
calls
his
dear
behind
the
bush
and
very
near
where
water
flows
where
green
grass
grows
gently
sing
good
cheer
and
best
of
all
through
twilight
calm
the
repeats
his
psalm
how
much
i
wishing
to
go
in
days
so
sweet
with
music
balm
is
not
a
proud
desire
of
mine
i
ask
for
nothing
superfine
no
heavy
weight
no
salmon
great
to
break
the
record
or
my
line
only
an
idle
little
stream
whose
amber
waters
softly
gleam
where
i
may
wade
through
woodland
shade
and
cast
the
fly
and
loaf
and
dream
only
a
trout
or
two
to
dart
from
foaming
pools
and
try
my
art
no
more
i
wishing
fishing
and
just
a
day
on

heart
little
rivers
a
river
is
the
most
human
and
companionable
of
all
inanimate
things
it
has
a
life
a
character
a
voice
of
its
own
and
is
as
full
of
good
fellowship
as
a
is
of
sap
it
can
talk
in
various
tones
loud
or
low
and
of
many
subjects
grave
and
gay
under
favourable
circumstances
it
will
even
make
a
shift
to
sing
not
in
a
fashion
that
can
be
reduced
to
notes
and
set
down
in
black
and
white
on
a
sheet
of
paper
but
in
a
vague
refreshing
manner
and
to
a
wandering
air
that
goes
over
the
hills
and
far
away
for
real
company
and
friendship
there
is
nothing
outside
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
is
comparable
to
a
river
i
will
admit
that
a
very
good
case
can
be
made
out
in
favour
of
some
other
objects
of
natural
affection
for
example
a
fair
apology
has
been
offered
by
those
ambitious
persons
who
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
sea
but
after
all
that
is
a
formless
and
disquieting
passion
it
lacks
solid
comfort
and
mutual
confidence
the
sea
is
too
big
for
loving
and
too
uncertain
it
will
not
fit
into
our
thoughts
it
has
no
personality
because
it
has
so
many
it
is
a
salt
abstraction
you
might
as
well
think
of
loving
a
glittering
generality
like
the
american
woman
one
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
mountains
are
more
satisfying
because
they
are
more
individual
it
is
possible
to
feel
a
very
strong
attachment
for
a
certain
range
whose
outline
has
grown
familiar
to
our
eyes
or
a
clear
peak
that
has
looked
down
day
after
day
upon
our
joys
and
sorrows
moderating
our
passions
with
its
calm
aspect
we
come
back
from
our
travels
and
the
sight
of
such
a
mountain
is
like
meeting
an
old
friend
unchanged
but
it
is
a
affection
the
mountain
is
voiceless
and
imperturbable
and
its
very
loftiness
and
serenity
sometimes
make
us
the
more
lonely
trees
seem
to
come
closer
to
our
life
they
are
often
rooted
in
our
richest
feelings
and
our
sweetest
memories
like
birds
build
nests
in
their
branches
i
remember
the
last
time
that
i
saw
james
russell
lowell
only
a
few
weeks
before
his
musical
voice
was
hushed
he
walked
out
with
me
into
the
quiet
garden
at
elmwood
to
say
there
was
a
great
tree
beside
the
house
towering
above
the
gable
and
covered
with
blossoms
from
base
to
summit
a
pyramid
of
green
supporting
a
thousand
smaller
pyramids
of
white
the
poet
looked
up
at
it
with
his
gray
face
and
laid
his
trembling
hand
upon
the
trunk
i
planted
the
nut
said
he
from
which
this
tree
grew
and
my
father
was
with
me
and
showed
me
how
to
plant
it
yes
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
behalf
of
and
when
i
recline
with
my
friend
tityrus
beneath
the
shade
of
his
favourite
oak
i
consent
in
his
devotions
but
when
i
invite
him
with
me
to
share
my
orisons
or
wander
alone
to
indulge
the
luxury
of
grateful
unlaborious
thought
my
feet
turn
not
to
a
tree
but
to
the
bank
of
a
river
for
there
the
musings
of
solitude
find
a
friendly
accompaniment
and
human
intercourse
is
purified
and
sweetened
by
the
flowing
murmuring
water
it
is
by
a
river
that
i
would
choose
to
make
love
and
to
revive
old
friendships
and
to
play
with
the
children
and
to
confess
my
faults
and
to
escape
from
vain
selfish
desires
and
to
cleanse
my
mind
from
all
the
false
and
foolish
things
that
mar
the
joy
and
peace
of
living
like
david
hart
i
pant
for
the
there
is
wisdom
in
the
advice
of
seneca
who
says
where
a
spring
rises
or
a
river
flows
there
should
we
build
altars
and
offer
sacrifices
the
personality
of
a
river
is
not
to
be
found
in
its
water
nor
in
its
bed
nor
in
its
shore
either
of
these
elements
by
itself
would
be
nothing
confine
the
fluid
contents
of
the
noblest
stream
in
a
walled
channel
of
stone
and
it
ceases
to
be
a
stream
it
becomes
what
charles
lamb
calls
a
mockery
of
a
river
a
liquid
artifice
a
wretched
conduit
but
take
away
the
water
from
the
most
beautiful
and
what
is
left
an
ugly
road
with
none
to
travel
it
a
long
ghastly
scar
on
the
bosom
of
the
earth
the
life
of
a
river
like
that
of
a
human
being
consists
in
the
union
of
soul
and
body
the
water
and
the
banks
they
belong
together
they
act
and
react
upon
each
other
the
stream
moulds
and
makes
the
shore
hollowing
out
a
bay
here
and
building
a
long
point
there
alluring
the
little
bushes
close
to
its
side
and
bending
the
tall
slim
trees
over
its
current
sweeping
a
rocky
ledge
clean
of
everything
but
moss
and
sending
a
still
lagoon
full
of
white
and
rosy
far
back
into
the
meadow
the
shore
guides
and
controls
the
stream
now
detaining
and
now
advancing
it
now
bending
it
in
a
hundred
sinuous
curves
and
now
speeding
it
straight
as
a
on
its
homeward
flight
here
hiding
the
water
in
a
deep
cleft
overhung
with
green
branches
and
there
spreading
it
out
like
a
mirror
framed
in
daisies
to
reflect
the
sky
and
the
clouds
sometimes
breaking
it
with
sudden
turns
and
unexpected
falls
into
a
foam
of
musical
laughter
sometimes
soothing
it
into
a
sleepy
motion
like
the
flow
of
a
dream
is
it
otherwise
with
the
men
and
women
whom
we
know
and
like
does
not
the
spirit
influence
the
form
and
the
form
affect
the
spirit
can
we
divide
and
separate
them
in
our
affections
i
am
no
friend
to
purely
psychological
attachments
in
some
unknown
future
they
may
be
satisfying
but
in
the
present
i
want
your
words
and
your
voice
with
your
thoughts
your
looks
and
your
gestures
to
interpret
your
feelings
the
warm
strong
grasp
of
greatheart
hand
is
as
dear
to
me
as
the
steadfast
fashion
of
his
friendships
the
lively
sparkling
eyes
of
the
master
of
rudder
grange
charm
me
as
much
as
the
nimbleness
of
his
fancy
and
the
firm
poise
of
the
hoosier
schoolmaster
shaggy
head
gives
me
new
confidence
in
the
solidity
of
his
views
of
life
i
like
the
pure
tranquillity
of
isabel
brow
as
well
as
her
most
silver
flow
of
counsel
in
distress
the
soft
cadences
and
turns
in
my
lady
katrina
speech
draw
me
into
the
humour
of
her
gentle
judgments
of
men
and
things
the
touches
of
quaintness
in
angelica
dress
her
folded
kerchief
and
hair
seem
to
partake
of
herself
and
enhance
my
admiration
for
the
sweet
order
of
her
thoughts
and
her
ideals
of
love
and
duty
even
so
the
stream
and
its
channel
are
one
life
and
i
can
not
think
of
the
swift
brown
flood
of
the
batiscan
without
its
shadowing
primeval
forests
or
the
crystalline
current
of
the
boquet
without
its
beds
of
pebbles
and
golden
sand
and
grassy
banks
embroidered
with
flowers
every
country
or
at
least
every
country
that
is
fit
for
habitation
has
its
own
rivers
and
every
river
has
its
own
quality
and
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
know
and
love
as
many
as
you
can
seeing
each
in
the
fairest
possible
light
and
receiving
from
each
the
best
that
it
has
to
give
the
torrents
of
norway
leap
down
from
their
mountain
home
with
plentiful
cataracts
and
run
brief
but
glorious
races
to
the
sea
the
streams
of
england
move
smoothly
through
green
fields
and
beside
ancient
sleepy
towns
the
scotch
rivers
brawl
through
the
open
moorland
and
flash
along
steep
highland
glens
the
rivers
of
the
alps
are
born
in
icy
caves
from
which
they
issue
forth
with
furious
turbid
waters
but
when
their
anger
has
been
forgotten
in
the
slumber
of
some
blue
lake
they
flow
down
more
softly
to
see
the
vineyards
of
france
and
italy
the
gray
castles
of
germany
the
verdant
meadows
of
holland
the
mighty
rivers
of
the
west
roll
their
yellow
floods
through
broad
valleys
or
plunge
down
dark
canyons
the
rivers
of
the
south
creep
under
dim
arboreal
archways
hung
with
banners
of
waving
moss
the
delaware
and
the
hudson
and
the
connecticut
are
the
children
of
the
catskills
and
the
adirondacks
and
the
white
mountains
cradled
among
the
forests
of
spruce
and
hemlock
playing
through
a
wild
woodland
youth
gathering
strength
from
numberless
tributaries
to
bear
their
great
burdens
of
lumber
and
turn
the
wheels
of
many
mills
issuing
from
the
hills
to
water
a
thousand
farms
and
descending
at
last
beside
new
cities
to
the
ancient
sea
every
river
that
flows
is
good
and
has
something
worthy
to
be
loved
but
those
that
we
love
most
are
always
the
ones
that
we
have
known
best
the
stream
that
ran
before
our
father
door
the
current
on
which
we
ventured
our
first
boat
or
cast
our
first
fly
the
brook
on
whose
banks
we
first
picked
the
twinflower
of
young
love
however
far
we
may
travel
we
come
back
to
naaman
state
of
mind
are
not
abana
and
pharpar
rivers
of
damascus
better
than
all
the
waters
of
israel
it
is
with
rivers
as
it
is
with
people
the
greatest
are
not
always
the
most
agreeable
nor
the
best
to
live
with
diogenes
must
have
been
an
uncomfortable
bedfellow
antinous
was
bored
to
death
in
the
society
of
the
emperor
hadrian
and
you
can
imagine
much
better
company
for
a
walking
trip
than
napoleon
bonaparte
semiramis
was
a
lofty
queen
but
i
fancy
that
ninus
had
more
than
one
bad
with
her
and
in
the
spacious
times
of
great
elizabeth
there
was
many
a
milkmaid
whom
the
wise
man
would
have
chosen
for
his
friend
before
the
royal
virgin
i
confess
says
the
poet
cowley
i
love
littleness
almost
in
all
things
a
little
convenient
estate
a
little
chearful
house
a
little
company
and
a
very
little
feast
and
if
i
were
ever
to
fall
in
love
again
which
is
a
great
passion
and
therefore
i
hope
i
have
done
with
it
it
would
be
i
think
with
prettiness
rather
than
with
majestical
beauty
i
would
neither
wish
that
my
mistress
nor
my
fortune
should
be
a
bona
roba
as
homer
uses
to
describe
his
beauties
like
a
daughter
of
great
jupiter
for
the
stateliness
and
largeness
of
her
person
but
as
lucretius
says
pumilio
greek
text
omitted
tota
merum
sal
now
in
talking
about
women
it
is
prudent
to
disguise
a
prejudice
like
this
in
the
security
of
a
dead
language
and
to
intrench
it
behind
a
fortress
of
reputable
authority
but
in
lowlier
and
less
dangerous
matters
such
as
we
are
now
concerned
with
one
may
dare
to
speak
in
plain
english
i
am
all
for
the
little
rivers
let
those
who
will
chant
in
heroic
verse
the
renown
of
amazon
and
mississippi
and
niagara
but
my
prose
shall
flow
or
straggle
along
at
such
a
pace
as
the
prosaic
muse
may
grant
me
to
attain
in
praise
of
beaverkill
and
neversink
and
swiftwater
of
saranac
and
raquette
and
ausable
of
allegash
and
aroostook
and
moose
river
i
take
my
walks
abroad
it
shall
be
to
trace
the
clear
rauma
from
its
rise
on
the
fjeld
to
its
rest
in
the
fjord
or
to
follow
the
ericht
and
the
halladale
through
the
heather
the
ziller
and
the
salzach
shall
be
my
guides
through
the
tyrol
the
rotha
and
the
dove
shall
lead
me
into
the
heart
of
england
my
sacrificial
flames
shall
be
kindled
with
along
the
wooded
stillwaters
of
the
penobscot
and
the
peribonca
and
my
libations
drawn
from
the
pure
current
of
the
ristigouche
and
the
ampersand
and
my
altar
of
remembrance
shall
rise
upon
the
rocks
beside
the
falls
of
seboomok
i
will
set
my
affections
upon
rivers
that
are
not
too
great
for
intimacy
and
if
by
chance
any
of
these
little
ones
have
also
become
famous
like
the
tweed
and
the
thames
and
the
arno
i
at
least
will
praise
them
because
they
are
still
at
heart
little
rivers
if
an
open
fire
is
as
charles
dudley
warner
says
the
eye
of
a
room
then
surely
a
little
river
may
be
called
the
mouth
the
most
expressive
feature
of
a
landscape
it
animates
and
enlivens
the
whole
scene
even
a
railway
journey
becomes
tolerable
when
the
track
follows
the
course
of
a
running
stream
what
charming
glimpses
you
catch
from
the
window
as
the
train
winds
along
the
valley
of
the
french
broad
from
asheville
or
climbs
the
southern
catskills
beside
the
aesopus
or
slides
down
the
pusterthal
with
the
rienz
or
follows
the
glommen
and
the
gula
from
christiania
to
throndhjem
here
is
a
mill
with
its
dripping
lazy
wheel
the
type
of
somnolent
industry
and
there
is
a
white
cascade
foaming
in
silent
pantomime
as
the
train
clatters
by
and
here
is
a
long
still
pool
with
the
cows
standing
in
the
water
and
swinging
their
tails
in
calm
indifference
to
the
passing
world
and
there
is
a
lone
fisherman
sitting
upon
a
rock
rapt
in
contemplation
of
the
point
of
his
rod
for
a
moment
you
become
a
partner
of
his
tranquil
enterprise
you
turn
around
you
crane
your
neck
to
get
the
last
sight
of
his
motionless
angle
you
do
not
know
what
kind
of
fish
he
expects
to
catch
nor
what
species
of
bait
he
is
using
but
at
least
you
pray
that
he
may
have
a
bite
before
the
train
swings
around
the
next
curve
and
if
perchance
your
wish
is
granted
and
you
see
him
gravely
draw
some
unknown
reluctant
shining
reward
of
patience
from
the
water
you
feel
like
swinging
your
hat
from
the
window
and
crying
out
good
luck
little
rivers
seem
to
have
the
indefinable
quality
that
belongs
to
certain
people
in
the
world
the
power
of
drawing
attention
without
courting
it
the
faculty
of
exciting
interest
by
their
very
presence
and
way
of
doing
things
the
most
fascinating
part
of
a
city
or
town
is
that
through
which
the
water
flows
idlers
always
choose
a
bridge
for
their
place
of
meditation
when
they
can
get
it
and
failing
that
you
will
find
them
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
quay
or
embankment
with
their
feet
hanging
over
the
water
what
a
piquant
mingling
of
indolence
and
vivacity
you
can
enjoy
by
the
the
best
point
of
view
in
rome
to
my
taste
is
the
ponte
san
angelo
and
in
florence
or
pisa
i
never
tire
of
loafing
along
the
lung
arno
you
do
not
know
london
until
you
have
seen
it
from
the
thames
and
you
will
miss
the
charm
of
cambridge
unless
you
take
a
little
boat
and
go
drifting
on
the
placid
cam
beneath
the
bending
trees
along
the
backs
of
the
colleges
but
the
real
way
to
know
a
little
river
is
not
to
glance
at
it
here
or
there
in
the
course
of
a
hasty
journey
nor
to
become
acquainted
with
it
after
it
has
been
partly
civilised
and
spoiled
by
too
close
contact
with
the
works
of
man
you
must
go
to
its
native
haunts
you
must
see
it
in
youth
and
freedom
you
must
accommodate
yourself
to
its
pace
and
give
yourself
to
its
influence
and
follow
its
meanderings
whithersoever
they
may
lead
you
now
of
this
pleasant
pastime
there
are
three
principal
forms
you
may
go
as
a
walker
taking
the
path
or
making
a
way
for
yourself
through
the
tangled
thickets
or
across
the
open
meadows
you
may
go
as
a
sailor
launching
your
light
canoe
on
the
swift
current
and
committing
yourself
for
a
day
or
a
week
or
a
month
to
the
delightful
uncertainties
of
a
voyage
through
the
forest
you
may
go
as
a
wader
stepping
into
the
stream
and
going
down
with
it
through
rapids
and
shallows
and
deeper
pools
until
you
come
to
the
end
of
your
courage
and
the
daylight
of
these
three
ways
i
know
not
which
is
best
but
in
all
of
them
the
essential
thing
is
that
you
must
be
willing
and
glad
to
be
led
you
must
take
the
little
river
for
your
guide
philosopher
and
friend
and
what
a
good
guidance
it
gives
you
how
cheerfully
it
lures
you
on
into
the
secrets
of
field
and
wood
and
brings
you
acquainted
with
the
birds
and
the
flowers
the
stream
can
show
you
better
than
any
other
teacher
how
nature
works
her
enchantments
with
colour
and
music
go
out
to
the
in
the
of
spring
and
follow
its
brimming
waters
through
the
budding
forests
to
that
corner
which
we
call
the
painter
camp
see
how
the
banks
are
all
enamelled
with
the
pale
hepatica
the
painted
trillium
and
the
delicate
spring
beauty
a
little
later
in
the
year
when
the
ferns
are
uncurling
their
long
fronds
the
troops
of
blue
and
white
violets
will
come
dancing
down
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
creep
venturously
out
to
the
very
end
of
that
long
log
in
the
water
before
these
have
vanished
the
yellow
and
the
cinquefoil
will
appear
followed
by
the
and
the
and
the
golden
then
the
unseen
painter
begins
to
mix
the
royal
colour
on
his
palette
and
the
red
of
the
catches
your
eye
if
you
are
lucky
you
may
find
in
midsummer
a
slender
fragrant
spike
of
the
orchis
and
you
can
not
help
finding
the
universal
yellow
returns
in
the
drooping
flowers
of
the
and
blue
repeats
itself
in
the
trembling
and
scarlet
is
glorified
in
the
flaming
robe
of
the
later
still
the
summer
closes
in
a
splendour
of
bloom
with
gentians
and
asters
and
goldenrod
you
never
get
so
close
to
the
birds
as
when
you
are
wading
quietly
down
a
little
river
casting
your
fly
deftly
under
the
branches
for
the
wary
trout
but
ever
on
the
lookout
for
all
the
various
pleasant
things
that
nature
has
to
bestow
upon
you
here
you
shall
come
upon
the
at
her
morning
bath
and
hear
her
sing
in
a
clump
of
that
low
tender
confidential
song
which
she
keeps
for
the
hours
of
domestic
intimacy
the
spotted
sandpiper
will
run
along
the
stones
before
you
crying
and
bowing
and
teetering
in
the
friendliest
manner
as
if
to
show
you
the
way
to
the
best
pools
in
the
thick
branches
of
the
hemlocks
that
stretch
across
the
stream
the
tiny
warblers
dressed
in
a
hundred
colours
chirp
and
twitter
confidingly
above
your
head
and
the
maryland
flitting
through
the
bushes
like
a
little
gleam
of
sunlight
calls
witchery
witchery
witchery
that
plaintive
forsaken
persistent
note
never
ceasing
even
in
the
noonday
silence
comes
from
the
drooping
upon
the
bough
of
some
high
tree
and
complaining
like
mariana
in
the
moated
grange
weary
weary
weary
when
the
stream
runs
out
into
the
old
clearing
or
down
through
the
pasture
you
find
other
and
livelier
birds
the
robins
with
his
sharp
saucy
call
and
breathless
merry
warble
the
bluebird
with
his
notes
of
pure
gladness
and
the
oriole
with
his
wild
flexible
whistle
the
chewink
bustling
about
in
the
thicket
talking
to
his
sweetheart
in
french
cherie
cherie
and
the
perched
on
his
favourite
limb
of
a
young
maple
dose
beside
the
water
and
singing
happily
through
sunshine
and
through
rain
this
is
the
true
bird
of
the
brook
after
all
the
winged
spirit
of
cheerfulness
and
contentment
the
patron
saint
of
little
rivers
the
fisherman
friend
he
seems
to
enter
into
your
sport
with
his
good
wishes
and
for
an
hour
at
a
time
while
you
are
trying
every
fly
in
your
book
from
a
black
gnat
to
a
white
miller
to
entice
the
crafty
old
trout
at
the
foot
of
the
the
close
above
you
will
be
chanting
patience
and
encouragement
and
when
at
last
success
crowns
your
endeavour
and
the
prize
is
glittering
in
your
net
the
bird
on
the
bough
breaks
out
in
an
ecstasy
of
congratulation
catch
catch
catch
oh
what
a
pretty
fellow
sweet
there
are
other
birds
that
seem
to
have
a
very
different
temper
the
sits
high
up
in
the
tree
bobbing
up
and
down
and
calling
to
his
mate
in
a
tone
of
affected
sweetness
but
when
you
come
in
sight
he
flies
away
with
a
harsh
cry
of
thief
thief
thief
the
kingfisher
ruffling
his
crest
in
solitary
pride
on
the
end
of
a
dead
branch
darts
down
the
stream
at
your
approach
winding
up
his
red
angrily
as
if
he
despised
you
for
interrupting
his
fishing
and
the
that
sang
so
charmingly
while
she
thought
herself
unobserved
now
tries
to
scare
you
away
by
screaming
snake
snake
as
evening
draws
near
and
the
light
beneath
the
trees
grows
yellower
and
the
air
is
full
of
filmy
insects
out
for
their
last
dance
the
voice
of
the
little
river
becomes
louder
and
more
distinct
the
true
poets
have
often
noticed
this
apparent
increase
in
the
sound
of
flowing
waters
at
nightfall
gray
in
one
of
his
letters
speaks
of
hearing
the
murmur
of
many
waters
not
audible
in
the
daytime
wordsworth
repeats
the
same
thought
almost
in
the
same
words
a
soft
and
lulling
sound
is
heard
of
streams
inaudible
by
day
and
tennyson
in
the
valley
of
cauteretz
tells
of
the
river
deepening
his
voice
with
deepening
of
the
night
it
is
in
this
mystical
hour
that
you
will
hear
the
most
celestial
and
entrancing
of
all
the
songs
of
the
thrushes
the
hermit
and
the
and
the
veery
sometimes
but
not
often
you
will
see
the
singers
i
remember
once
at
the
close
of
a
beautiful
fishing
on
the
swiftwater
i
came
out
just
after
sunset
into
a
little
open
space
in
an
elbow
of
the
stream
it
was
still
early
spring
and
the
leaves
were
tiny
on
the
top
of
a
small
sumac
not
thirty
feet
away
from
me
sat
a
veery
i
could
see
the
pointed
spots
upon
his
breast
the
swelling
of
his
white
throat
and
the
sparkle
of
his
eyes
as
he
poured
his
whole
heart
into
a
long
liquid
chant
the
clear
notes
rising
and
falling
echoing
and
interlacing
in
endless
curves
of
sound
orb
within
orb
intricate
wonderful
other
can
be
translated
into
words
but
not
this
there
is
no
interpretation
it
is
music
as
sidney
lanier
defines
it
love
in
search
of
a
word
but
it
is
not
only
to
the
real
life
of
birds
and
flowers
that
the
little
rivers
introduce
you
they
lead
you
often
into
familiarity
with
human
nature
in
undress
rejoicing
in
the
liberty
of
old
clothes
or
of
none
at
all
people
do
not
mince
along
the
banks
of
streams
in
shoes
or
crepitating
silks
corduroy
and
and
flannel
are
the
stuffs
that
suit
this
region
and
the
frequenters
of
these
paths
go
their
natural
gaits
in
or
rubber
boots
or
the
girdle
of
conventionality
is
laid
aside
and
the
skirts
rise
with
the
spirits
a
stream
that
flows
through
a
country
of
upland
farms
will
show
you
many
a
pretty
bit
of
genre
painting
here
is
the
at
the
foot
of
the
kitchen
garden
and
the
tubs
are
set
upon
a
few
planks
close
to
the
water
and
the
farmer
daughters
with
bare
arms
and
gowns
tucked
up
are
wringing
out
the
clothes
do
you
remember
what
happened
to
ralph
peden
in
the
lilac
sunbonnet
when
he
came
on
a
scene
like
this
he
tumbled
at
once
into
love
with
winsome
charteris
and
far
over
his
head
and
what
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
to
see
a
little
country
lad
riding
one
of
the
to
water
thumping
his
naked
heels
against
the
ribs
of
his
stolid
steed
and
pulling
hard
on
the
halter
as
if
it
were
the
bridle
of
bucephalus
or
perhaps
it
is
a
riotous
company
of
boys
that
have
come
down
to
the
old
and
are
now
splashing
and
gambolling
through
the
water
like
a
drove
of
white
seals
very
much
you
had
hoped
to
catch
a
goodly
trout
in
that
hole
but
what
of
that
the
sight
of
a
harmless
hour
of
mirth
is
better
than
a
fish
any
day
possibly
you
will
overtake
another
fisherman
on
the
stream
it
may
be
one
of
those
fabulous
countrymen
with
long
cedar
poles
and
lines
who
are
commonly
reported
to
catch
such
enormous
strings
of
fish
but
who
rarely
so
far
as
my
observation
goes
do
anything
more
than
fill
their
pockets
with
fingerlings
the
trained
angler
who
uses
the
finest
tackle
and
drops
his
fly
on
the
water
as
accurately
as
henry
james
places
a
word
in
a
story
is
the
man
who
takes
the
most
and
the
largest
fish
in
the
long
run
perhaps
the
fisherman
ahead
of
you
is
such
an
one
a
man
whom
you
have
known
in
town
as
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
a
merchant
or
a
preacher
going
about
his
business
in
the
hideous
respectability
of
a
high
silk
hat
and
a
long
black
coat
how
good
it
is
to
see
him
now
in
the
freedom
of
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
gray
felt
with
flies
stuck
around
the
band
in
professor
john
wilson
essays
critical
and
imaginative
there
is
a
brilliant
description
of
a
bishop
fishing
which
i
am
sure
is
drawn
from
the
life
thus
a
bishop
sans
wig
and
petticoat
in
a
hairy
cap
black
jacket
corduroy
breeches
and
leathern
leggins
creel
on
back
and
rod
in
hand
sallying
from
his
palace
impatient
to
reach
a
famous
ere
the
sun
leave
his
cloud
appears
not
only
a
pillar
of
his
church
but
of
his
kind
and
in
such
a
costume
is
manifestly
on
the
high
road
to
canterbury
and
the
i
have
had
the
good
luck
to
see
quite
a
number
of
bishops
parochial
and
diocesan
in
that
style
and
the
vision
has
always
dissolved
my
doubts
in
regard
to
the
validity
of
their
claim
to
the
true
apostolic
succession
men
little
ways
are
usually
more
interesting
and
often
more
instructive
than
their
grand
manners
when
they
are
off
guard
they
frequently
show
to
better
advantage
than
when
they
are
on
parade
i
get
more
pleasure
out
of
boswell
johnson
than
i
do
out
of
rasselas
or
the
rambler
the
little
flowers
of
francis
appear
to
me
far
more
precious
than
the
most
learned
german
and
french
analyses
of
his
character
there
is
a
passage
in
jonathan
edwards
personal
narrative
about
a
certain
walk
that
he
took
in
the
fields
near
his
father
house
and
the
blossoming
of
the
flowers
in
the
spring
which
i
would
not
exchange
for
the
whole
of
his
dissertation
on
the
freedom
of
the
will
and
the
very
best
thing
of
charles
darwin
that
i
know
is
a
bit
from
a
letter
to
his
wife
at
last
i
fell
asleep
says
he
on
the
grass
and
awoke
with
a
chorus
of
birds
singing
around
me
and
squirrels
running
up
the
tree
and
some
woodpeckers
laughing
and
it
was
as
pleasant
and
rural
a
scene
as
ever
i
saw
and
i
did
not
care
one
penny
how
any
of
the
birds
or
beasts
had
been
formed
little
rivers
have
small
responsibilities
they
are
not
expected
to
bear
huge
navies
on
their
breast
or
supply
a
to
the
factories
of
a
monstrous
town
neither
do
you
come
to
them
hoping
to
draw
out
leviathan
with
a
hook
it
is
enough
if
they
run
a
harmless
amiable
course
and
keep
the
groves
and
fields
green
and
fresh
along
their
banks
and
offer
a
happy
alternation
of
nimble
rapids
and
quiet
pools
with
here
and
there
a
lusty
trout
and
here
and
there
a
grayling
when
you
set
out
to
explore
one
of
these
minor
streams
in
your
canoe
you
have
no
intention
of
discoveries
or
thrilling
and
adventures
you
float
placidly
down
the
long
stillwaters
and
make
your
way
patiently
through
the
tangle
of
fallen
trees
that
block
the
stream
and
run
the
smaller
falls
and
carry
your
boat
around
the
larger
ones
with
no
loftier
ambition
than
to
reach
a
good
before
dark
and
to
pass
the
intervening
hours
pleasantly
without
offence
to
god
or
man
it
is
an
agreeable
and
advantageous
frame
of
mind
for
one
who
has
done
his
fair
share
of
work
in
the
world
and
is
not
inclined
to
grumble
at
his
wages
there
are
few
moods
in
which
we
are
more
susceptible
of
gentle
instruction
and
i
suspect
there
are
many
tempers
and
attitudes
often
called
virtuous
in
which
the
human
spirit
appears
to
less
advantage
in
the
sight
of
heaven
it
is
not
required
of
every
man
and
woman
to
be
or
to
do
something
great
most
of
us
must
content
ourselves
with
taking
small
parts
in
the
chorus
shall
we
have
no
little
lyrics
because
homer
and
dante
have
written
epics
and
because
we
have
heard
the
great
organ
at
freiburg
shall
the
sound
of
kathi
zither
in
the
alpine
hut
please
us
no
more
even
those
who
have
greatness
thrust
upon
them
will
do
well
to
lay
the
burden
down
now
and
then
and
congratulate
themselves
that
they
are
not
altogether
answerable
for
the
conduct
of
the
universe
or
at
least
not
all
the
time
i
reckon
said
a
cowboy
to
me
one
day
as
we
were
riding
through
the
bad
lands
of
dakota
there
some
one
bigger
than
me
running
this
outfit
he
can
to
it
well
enough
while
i
smoke
my
pipe
after
the
there
is
such
a
thing
as
taking
ourselves
and
the
world
too
seriously
or
at
any
rate
too
anxiously
half
of
the
secular
unrest
and
dismal
profane
sadness
of
modern
society
comes
from
the
vain
idea
that
every
man
is
bound
to
be
a
critic
of
life
and
to
let
no
day
pass
without
finding
some
fault
with
the
general
order
of
things
or
projecting
some
plan
for
its
improvement
and
the
other
half
comes
from
the
greedy
notion
that
a
man
life
does
consist
after
all
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
that
he
possesses
and
that
it
is
somehow
or
other
more
respectable
and
pious
to
be
always
at
work
making
a
larger
living
than
it
is
to
lie
on
your
back
in
the
green
pastures
and
beside
the
still
waters
and
thank
god
that
you
are
alive
come
then
my
gentle
reader
for
by
this
time
you
have
discovered
that
this
chapter
is
only
a
preface
in
disguise
a
declaration
of
principles
or
the
want
of
them
an
apology
or
a
defence
as
you
choose
to
take
it
and
if
we
are
agreed
let
us
walk
together
but
if
not
let
us
part
here
with
out
you
shall
not
be
deceived
in
this
book
it
is
nothing
but
a
handful
of
rustic
variations
on
the
old
tune
of
rest
and
be
thankful
a
record
of
unconventional
travel
a
pilgrim
scrip
with
a
few
bits
of
philosophy
in
it
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
very
little
useful
information
and
absolutely
no
criticism
of
the
universe
to
be
found
in
this
volume
so
if
you
are
what
izaak
walton
calls
a
severe
man
you
would
better
carry
it
back
to
the
bookseller
and
get
your
money
again
if
he
will
give
it
to
you
and
go
your
way
rejoicing
after
your
own
melancholy
fashion
but
if
you
care
for
plain
pleasures
and
informal
company
and
friendly
observations
on
men
and
things
and
a
few
true
then
perhaps
you
may
find
something
here
not
unworthy
your
perusal
and
so
i
wish
that
your
winter
fire
may
burn
clear
and
bright
while
you
read
these
pages
and
that
the
summer
days
may
be
fair
and
the
fish
may
rise
merrily
to
your
fly
whenever
you
follow
one
of
these
little
rivers
a
leaf
of
spearmint
recollections
of
a
boy
and
a
rod
it
puzzles
me
now
that
i
remember
all
these
young
impressions
so
because
i
took
no
heed
of
them
at
the
time
whatever
and
yet
they
come
upon
me
bright
when
nothing
else
is
evident
in
the
gray
fog
of
b
blackmore
lorna
doone
of
all
the
faculties
of
the
human
mind
memory
is
the
one
that
is
most
easily
led
by
the
nose
there
is
a
secret
power
in
the
sense
of
smell
which
draws
the
mind
backward
into
the
pleasant
land
of
old
times
if
you
could
paint
a
picture
of
memory
in
the
symbolical
manner
of
quarles
emblems
it
should
represent
a
man
travelling
the
highway
with
a
dusty
pack
upon
his
shoulders
and
stooping
to
draw
in
a
long
sweet
breath
from
the
small
flowers
of
an
straggling
through
the
fence
of
a
neglected
garden
or
perhaps
for
a
choice
of
emblems
you
would
better
take
a
yet
more
homely
and
familiar
scent
the
cool
fragrance
of
lilacs
drifting
through
the
june
morning
from
the
old
bush
that
stands
between
the
kitchen
door
and
the
well
the
warm
layer
of
pungent
aromatic
air
that
floats
over
the
in
a
still
july
noon
the
drowsy
dew
of
odour
that
falls
from
the
big
tree
by
the
roadside
as
you
are
driving
homeward
through
the
twilight
of
august
or
best
of
all
the
clean
spicy
unexpected
unmistakable
smell
of
a
bed
of
spearmint
that
is
the
bed
whereon
memory
loves
to
lie
and
dream
why
not
choose
mint
as
the
symbol
of
remembrance
it
is
the
true
of
our
northern
clime
the
myrrh
and
frankincense
of
the
land
of
lingering
snow
when
its
perfume
rises
the
shrines
of
the
past
are
unveiled
and
the
magical
rites
of
reminiscence
begin
i
you
are
fishing
down
the
swiftwater
in
the
early
spring
in
a
shallow
pool
which
the
drought
of
summer
will
soon
change
into
dry
land
you
see
the
shoots
of
a
little
plant
thrusting
themselves
up
between
the
pebbles
and
just
beginning
to
overtop
the
falling
water
you
pluck
a
leaf
of
it
as
you
turn
out
of
the
stream
to
find
a
comfortable
place
for
lunch
and
rolling
it
between
your
fingers
to
see
whether
it
smells
like
a
good
salad
for
your
bread
and
cheese
you
discover
suddenly
that
it
is
new
mint
for
the
rest
of
that
day
you
are
bewitched
you
follow
a
stream
that
runs
through
the
country
of
auld
lang
syne
and
fill
your
creel
with
the
recollections
of
a
boy
and
a
rod
and
yet
strangely
enough
you
can
not
recall
the
boy
himself
at
all
distinctly
there
is
only
the
faintest
image
of
him
on
the
endless
roll
of
films
that
has
been
wound
through
your
mental
camera
and
in
the
very
spots
where
his
small
figure
should
appear
it
seems
as
if
the
pictures
were
always
just
a
blur
and
the
dim
outline
of
a
new
cap
or
a
jacket
with
extra
pockets
or
a
pair
of
shoes
that
is
all
you
can
see
but
the
people
that
the
boy
saw
the
companions
who
helped
or
hindered
him
in
his
adventures
the
sublime
and
marvellous
scenes
among
the
catskills
and
the
adirondacks
and
the
green
mountains
in
the
midst
of
which
he
lived
and
moved
and
had
his
summer
holidays
all
these
stand
out
sharp
and
clear
as
the
bab
ballads
say
photographically
lined
on
the
tablets
of
your
mind
and
most
vivid
do
these
scenes
and
people
become
when
the
vague
and
irrecoverable
boy
who
walks
among
them
carries
a
rod
over
his
shoulder
and
you
detect
the
soft
bulginess
of
wet
fish
about
his
clothing
and
perhaps
the
tail
of
a
big
one
emerging
from
his
pocket
then
it
seems
almost
as
if
these
were
things
that
had
really
happened
and
of
which
you
yourself
were
a
great
part
the
rod
was
a
reward
yet
not
exactly
of
merit
it
was
an
instrument
of
education
in
the
hand
of
a
father
less
indiscriminate
than
solomon
who
chose
to
interpret
the
text
in
a
new
way
and
preferred
to
educate
his
child
by
encouraging
him
in
pursuits
which
were
harmless
and
wholesome
rather
than
by
chastising
him
for
practices
which
would
likely
enough
never
have
been
thought
of
if
they
had
not
been
forbidden
the
boy
enjoyed
this
kind
of
father
at
the
time
and
later
he
came
to
understand
with
a
grateful
heart
that
there
is
no
richer
inheritance
in
all
the
treasury
of
unearned
blessings
for
after
all
the
love
the
patience
the
kindly
wisdom
of
a
grown
man
who
can
enter
into
the
perplexities
and
turbulent
impulses
of
a
boy
heart
and
give
him
cheerful
companionship
and
lead
him
on
by
free
and
joyful
ways
to
know
and
choose
the
things
that
are
pure
and
lovely
and
of
good
report
make
as
fair
an
image
as
we
can
find
of
that
loving
patient
wisdom
which
must
be
above
us
all
if
any
good
is
to
come
out
of
our
childish
race
now
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
boy
came
into
possession
of
his
undreaded
rod
he
was
by
nature
and
heredity
one
of
those
predestined
anglers
whom
izaak
walton
tersely
describes
as
born
so
his
earliest
passion
was
fishing
his
favourite
passage
in
holy
writ
was
that
place
where
simon
peter
throws
a
line
into
the
sea
and
pulls
out
a
great
fish
at
the
first
cast
but
hitherto
his
passion
had
been
indulged
under
difficulties
with
improvised
apparatus
of
cut
poles
and
flabby
pieces
of
string
and
bent
pins
which
always
failed
to
hold
the
biggest
fish
or
perhaps
with
borrowed
tackle
dangling
a
fat
worm
in
vain
before
the
noses
of
the
staring
supercilious
sunfish
that
poised
themselves
in
the
clear
water
around
the
lake
house
dock
at
lake
george
or
at
best
on
picnic
parties
across
the
lake
marred
by
the
humiliating
presence
of
nurses
and
disturbed
by
the
obstinate
refusal
of
old
horace
the
boatman
to
believe
that
the
boy
could
bait
his
own
hook
but
sometimes
crowned
with
the
delight
of
bringing
home
a
whole
basketful
of
yellow
perch
and
of
nobler
sport
with
game
fish
like
the
vaulting
salmon
and
the
merry
pugnacious
trout
as
yet
the
boy
had
only
dreamed
but
he
had
heard
that
there
were
such
fish
in
the
streams
that
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
around
lake
george
and
he
was
at
the
happy
age
when
he
could
believe
anything
if
it
was
sufficiently
interesting
there
was
one
little
river
and
only
one
within
his
knowledge
and
the
reach
of
his
short
legs
it
was
a
tiny
lively
rivulet
that
came
out
of
the
woods
about
half
a
mile
away
from
the
hotel
and
ran
down
through
a
sloping
meadow
crossing
the
road
under
a
flat
bridge
of
boards
just
beyond
the
shop
at
the
lower
end
of
the
village
it
seemed
large
enough
to
the
boy
and
he
had
long
had
his
eye
upon
it
as
a
fitting
theatre
for
the
beginning
of
a
real
angler
life
those
rapids
those
falls
those
deep
whirling
pools
with
beautiful
foam
on
them
like
soft
white
custard
were
they
not
such
places
as
the
trout
loved
to
hide
in
you
can
see
the
long
hotel
piazza
with
the
gossipy
groups
of
wooden
chairs
standing
vacant
in
the
early
afternoon
for
the
people
are
dallying
with
the
ultimate
nuts
and
raisins
of
their
dinner
a
villainous
clatter
of
innumerable
little
comes
from
the
open
windows
of
the
pantry
as
the
boy
steals
past
the
kitchen
end
of
the
house
with
horace
lightest
bamboo
pole
over
his
shoulder
and
a
little
brother
in
skirts
and
short
white
stockings
tagging
along
behind
him
when
they
come
to
the
fence
where
the
brook
runs
out
of
the
field
the
question
is
over
or
under
the
lowlier
method
seems
safer
for
the
little
brother
as
well
as
less
conspicuous
for
persons
who
desire
to
avoid
publicity
until
their
enterprise
has
achieved
success
so
they
crawl
beneath
a
bend
in
the
lowest
rail
only
tearing
one
tiny
hole
in
a
jacket
and
making
some
juicy
green
stains
on
the
white
stockings
and
emerge
with
suppressed
excitement
in
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
buttercups
and
daisies
what
an
afternoon
how
endless
and
yet
how
swift
what
perilous
efforts
to
leap
across
the
foaming
stream
at
its
narrowest
points
what
escapes
from
quagmires
and
possible
quicksands
what
stealthy
creeping
through
the
grass
to
the
edge
of
a
likely
pool
and
cautious
dropping
of
the
line
into
an
unseen
depth
and
patient
waiting
for
a
bite
until
the
restless
little
brother
prowling
about
below
discovers
that
the
hook
is
not
in
the
water
at
all
but
lying
on
top
of
a
dry
stone
thereby
proving
that
patience
is
not
the
only
virtue
or
at
least
that
it
does
a
better
business
when
it
has
a
small
vice
of
impatience
in
partnership
with
it
how
tired
the
adventurers
grow
as
the
day
wears
away
and
as
yet
they
have
taken
nothing
but
their
strength
and
courage
return
as
if
by
magic
when
there
comes
a
surprising
twitch
at
the
line
in
a
shallow
unpromising
rapid
and
with
a
jerk
of
the
pole
a
small
wiggling
fish
is
whirled
through
the
air
and
landed
thirty
feet
back
in
the
meadow
for
pity
sake
do
lose
him
there
he
is
among
the
roots
of
the
blue
flag
i
got
him
how
cold
he
is
how
slippery
how
pretty
just
like
a
piece
of
rainbow
do
you
see
the
red
spots
did
you
notice
how
gamy
he
was
little
brother
how
he
played
it
is
a
trout
for
sure
a
real
trout
almost
as
long
as
your
hand
so
the
two
lads
tramp
along
up
the
stream
chattering
as
if
there
were
no
rubric
of
silence
in
the
angler
code
presently
another
troutling
falls
a
victim
to
their
unpremeditated
art
and
they
begin
already
being
human
to
wish
for
something
larger
in
the
very
last
pool
that
they
dare
attempt
a
dark
hole
under
a
steep
bank
where
the
brook
issues
from
the
woods
the
boy
drags
out
the
prize
a
splendid
trout
longer
than
a
new
but
he
feels
sure
that
there
must
be
another
even
larger
in
the
same
place
he
swings
his
line
out
carefully
over
the
water
and
just
as
he
is
about
to
drop
it
in
the
little
brother
perched
on
the
sloping
brink
slips
on
the
smooth
and
goes
sliddering
down
into
the
pool
up
to
his
waist
how
he
weeps
with
dismay
and
how
funnily
his
dress
sticks
to
him
as
he
crawls
out
but
his
grief
is
soon
assuaged
by
the
privilege
of
carrying
the
trout
strung
on
an
alder
twig
and
it
is
a
happy
muddy
proud
pair
of
urchins
that
climb
over
the
fence
out
of
the
field
of
triumph
at
the
close
of
the
day
what
does
the
father
say
as
he
meets
them
in
the
road
is
he
frowning
or
smiling
under
that
big
brown
beard
you
can
not
be
quite
sure
but
one
thing
is
clear
he
is
as
much
elated
over
the
capture
of
the
real
trout
as
any
one
he
is
ready
to
deal
mildly
with
a
little
irregularity
for
the
sake
of
encouraging
pluck
and
perseverance
before
the
three
comrades
have
reached
the
hotel
the
boy
has
promised
faithfully
never
to
take
his
little
brother
off
again
without
asking
leave
and
the
father
has
promised
that
the
boy
shall
have
a
real
jointed
of
his
own
so
that
he
will
not
need
to
borrow
old
horace
pole
any
more
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
family
are
to
have
a
private
dish
not
an
affair
of
vulgar
bony
fish
that
nurses
can
catch
but
trout
three
of
them
but
the
boy
looks
up
from
the
table
and
sees
the
adored
of
his
soul
annie
v
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
faring
on
the
common
food
of
mortals
shall
she
eat
the
ordinary
breakfast
while
he
feasts
on
dainties
do
not
other
sportsmen
send
their
spoils
to
the
ladies
whom
they
admire
the
waiter
must
bring
a
hot
plate
and
take
this
largest
trout
to
miss
v
miss
annie
not
her
sister
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
face
of
augustus
is
as
solemn
as
an
ebony
idol
while
he
plays
his
part
of
cupid
messenger
the
fair
annie
affects
surprise
she
accepts
the
offering
rather
indifferently
her
curls
drop
down
over
her
cheeks
to
cover
some
small
confusion
but
for
an
instant
the
corner
of
her
eye
catches
the
boy
sidelong
glance
and
she
nods
perceptibly
whereupon
his
mother
very
inconsiderately
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
yesterday
escapade
has
his
face
dreadfully
beautiful
annie
v
who
among
all
the
unripened
nymphs
that
played
at
among
the
maples
on
the
hotel
lawn
or
waded
with
white
feet
along
the
yellow
beach
beyond
the
point
of
pines
flying
with
merry
shrieks
into
the
woods
when
a
of
boys
appeared
suddenly
around
the
corner
or
danced
the
lancers
in
the
big
bare
parlours
before
the
ball
began
who
in
all
that
joyous
innocent
bevy
could
be
compared
with
you
for
charm
or
daring
how
your
dark
eyes
sparkled
and
how
the
long
brown
ringlets
tossed
around
your
small
head
when
you
stood
up
that
evening
slim
and
straight
and
taller
by
half
a
head
than
your
companions
in
the
room
where
the
children
were
playing
forfeits
and
said
there
is
not
one
boy
here
that
dares
to
kiss
me
then
you
ran
out
on
the
dark
porch
where
the
honeysuckle
vines
grew
up
the
tall
inane
corinthian
pillars
did
you
blame
the
boy
for
following
and
were
you
very
angry
indeed
about
what
happened
until
you
broke
out
laughing
at
his
cravat
which
had
slipped
around
behind
his
ear
that
was
the
first
time
he
ever
noticed
how
much
sweeter
the
honeysuckle
smells
at
night
than
in
the
day
it
was
his
entrance
examination
in
the
school
of
nature
human
and
otherwise
he
felt
that
there
was
a
whole
continent
of
newly
discovered
poetry
within
him
and
worshipped
his
columbus
disguised
in
curls
your
boy
is
your
true
idealist
after
all
although
or
perhaps
because
he
is
still
uncivilised
ii
the
arrival
of
the
rod
in
four
joints
with
an
extra
tip
a
brass
reel
and
the
other
luxuries
for
which
a
true
angler
would
willingly
exchange
the
necessaries
of
life
marked
a
new
epoch
in
the
boy
career
at
the
uplifting
of
that
wand
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
hand
of
another
moses
the
waters
of
infancy
rolled
back
and
the
way
was
opened
into
the
promised
land
whither
the
tyrant
nurses
with
all
their
proud
array
of
could
not
follow
the
way
was
open
but
not
by
any
means
dry
one
of
the
first
events
in
the
dispensation
of
the
rod
was
the
purchase
of
a
pair
of
high
rubber
boots
inserted
in
this
armour
of
modern
infantry
and
transfigured
with
delight
the
boy
clumped
through
all
the
little
rivers
within
a
circuit
of
ten
miles
from
caldwell
and
began
to
learn
by
parental
example
the
yet
unmastered
art
of
complete
angling
but
because
some
of
the
streams
were
deep
and
strong
and
his
legs
were
short
and
slender
and
his
ambition
was
even
taller
than
his
boots
the
father
would
sometimes
take
him
up
pickaback
and
wade
along
carefully
through
the
perilous
places
which
are
often
in
this
world
the
very
places
one
longs
to
fish
in
so
in
your
remembrance
you
can
see
the
little
rubber
boots
sticking
out
under
the
father
arms
and
the
rod
projecting
over
his
head
and
the
bait
dangling
down
unsteadily
into
the
deep
holes
and
the
delighted
boy
hooking
and
playing
and
basketing
his
trout
high
in
the
air
how
many
of
our
best
catches
in
life
are
made
from
some
one
else
shoulders
from
this
summer
the
whole
earth
became
to
the
boy
as
tennyson
describes
the
lotus
country
a
land
of
streams
in
and
in
town
he
acknowledged
the
sway
of
those
mysterious
and
irresistible
forces
which
produce
tops
at
one
season
and
marbles
at
another
and
kites
at
another
and
bind
all
boyish
hearts
to
play
at
the
due
time
more
certainly
than
the
stars
are
bound
to
their
orbits
but
when
vacation
came
with
its
annual
exodus
from
the
city
there
was
only
one
sign
in
the
zodiac
and
that
was
pisces
no
country
seemed
to
him
tolerable
without
trout
and
no
landscape
beautiful
unless
enlivened
by
a
young
river
among
what
delectable
mountains
did
those
watery
guides
lead
his
vagrant
steps
and
with
what
curious
mixed
and
sometimes
profitable
company
did
they
make
him
familiar
there
was
one
exquisite
stream
among
the
alleghanies
called
lycoming
creek
beside
which
the
family
spent
a
summer
in
a
decadent
inn
kept
by
a
tremulous
landlord
who
was
always
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
porch
and
whose
most
memorable
remark
was
that
he
had
a
misery
in
his
stomach
this
form
of
speech
amused
the
boy
but
he
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
it
it
was
the
description
of
an
unimaginable
experience
in
a
region
which
was
as
yet
known
to
him
only
as
the
seat
of
pleasure
he
did
not
understand
how
any
one
could
be
miserable
when
he
could
catch
trout
from
his
own
dooryard
the
big
creek
with
its
sharp
turns
from
side
to
side
of
the
valley
its
falls
in
the
gorge
and
its
long
still
reaches
in
the
where
the
grew
as
if
in
an
orchard
and
the
superfluity
of
grasshoppers
made
the
trout
fat
and
dainty
was
too
wide
to
fit
the
boy
but
nature
keeps
all
sizes
in
her
stock
and
a
smaller
stream
called
rocky
run
came
tumbling
down
opposite
the
inn
as
if
made
to
order
for
juvenile
use
how
well
you
can
follow
it
through
the
old
pasture
overgrown
with
alders
and
up
past
the
and
the
crumbling
sluice
into
the
from
which
it
leaps
laughing
the
water
except
just
after
a
is
as
transparent
as
glass
i
mean
in
small
panes
with
just
a
tinge
of
green
in
it
like
the
air
in
a
grove
of
young
birches
twelve
feet
down
in
the
narrow
chasm
below
the
falls
where
the
water
is
full
of
tiny
bubbles
like
apollinaris
you
can
see
the
trout
poised
with
their
heads
motionless
but
quivering
a
little
as
if
they
were
strung
on
wires
the
bed
of
the
stream
has
been
scooped
out
of
the
solid
rock
here
and
there
banks
of
sand
have
been
deposited
and
accumulations
of
loose
stone
disguise
the
real
nature
of
the
channel
great
boulders
have
been
rolled
down
the
alleyway
and
left
where
they
chanced
to
stick
the
stream
must
get
around
them
or
under
them
as
best
it
can
but
there
are
other
places
where
everything
has
been
swept
clean
nothing
remains
but
the
primitive
strata
and
the
flowing
water
merrily
tickles
the
bare
ribs
of
mother
earth
whirling
stones
in
the
spring
floods
have
cut
in
the
rock
as
round
and
even
as
if
they
had
been
made
with
a
drill
and
sometimes
you
can
see
the
very
stone
that
sunk
the
well
lying
at
the
bottom
there
are
long
straight
sloping
troughs
through
which
the
water
runs
like
a
there
are
huge
basins
into
which
the
water
rumbles
over
a
ledge
as
if
some
one
were
pouring
it
very
steadily
out
of
a
pitcher
and
from
which
it
glides
away
without
a
ripple
flowing
over
a
smooth
pavement
of
rock
which
shelves
down
from
the
shallow
foot
to
the
deep
head
of
the
pool
the
boy
wonders
how
far
he
dare
wade
out
along
that
slippery
floor
the
water
is
within
an
inch
of
his
now
but
the
slope
seems
very
even
and
just
beyond
his
reach
a
good
fish
is
rising
only
one
step
more
and
then
like
the
wicked
man
in
the
psalm
his
feet
begin
to
slide
slowly
and
standing
bolt
upright
with
the
rod
held
high
above
his
head
as
if
it
must
on
no
account
get
wet
he
glides
forward
up
to
his
neck
in
the
bath
gasping
with
amazement
there
have
been
other
and
more
serious
situations
in
life
into
which
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
have
made
an
equally
unwilling
and
embarrassed
entrance
and
in
which
you
have
been
surprised
to
find
yourself
not
only
up
to
your
neck
but
over
and
you
are
a
lucky
man
if
you
have
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
before
wading
out
and
make
sure
at
least
of
the
fish
that
tempted
you
into
your
predicament
but
rocky
run
they
say
exists
no
longer
it
has
been
blasted
by
miners
out
of
all
resemblance
to
itself
and
bewitched
into
a
dingy
to
turn
wheels
for
the
ugly
giant
trade
it
is
only
in
the
valley
of
remembrance
that
its
current
still
flows
like
liquid
air
and
only
in
that
country
that
you
can
still
see
the
famous
men
who
came
and
went
along
the
banks
of
the
lyocoming
when
the
boy
was
there
there
was
collins
who
was
a
wondrous
adept
at
daping
dapping
or
dibbling
with
a
grasshopper
and
who
once
brought
in
a
string
of
trout
which
he
laid
out
head
to
tail
on
the
grass
before
the
house
in
a
line
of
beauty
feet
long
a
mighty
bass
voice
had
this
collins
also
and
could
sing
larboard
watch
ahoy
down
in
a
and
other
profound
ditties
in
a
way
to
make
all
the
glasses
on
the
table
jingle
but
withal
as
you
now
suspect
rather
a
fishy
character
and
undeserving
of
the
unqualified
respect
which
the
boy
had
for
him
and
there
was
romsen
lean
satirical
kindly
a
skilful
though
reluctant
physician
who
regarded
it
as
a
personal
injury
if
any
one
in
the
party
fell
sick
in
summer
time
and
a
passionately
unsuccessful
hunter
who
would
sit
all
night
in
the
crotch
of
a
tree
beside
an
alleged
and
come
home
perfectly
satisfied
if
he
had
heard
a
hedgehog
grunt
it
was
he
who
called
attention
to
the
discrepancy
between
the
boy
appetite
and
his
size
by
saying
loudly
at
a
picnic
i
would
grudge
you
what
you
eat
my
boy
if
i
could
only
see
that
it
did
you
any
good
which
remark
was
not
forgiven
until
the
doctor
redeemed
his
reputation
by
pronouncing
a
serious
medical
opinion
before
a
council
of
mothers
to
the
effect
that
it
did
not
really
hurt
a
boy
to
get
his
feet
wet
that
was
worthy
of
galen
in
his
most
inspired
moment
and
there
was
hearty
genial
paul
merit
whose
mere
company
was
an
education
in
good
manners
and
who
could
eat
eight
eggs
for
supper
without
ruffling
his
equanimity
and
the
tall
thin
grinning
major
whom
an
angry
irishwoman
once
described
as
like
a
comb
all
back
and
teeth
and
many
more
were
the
comrades
of
the
boy
father
all
of
whom
he
admired
and
followed
when
they
would
let
him
but
none
so
much
as
the
father
himself
because
he
was
the
wisest
kindest
and
merriest
of
all
that
merry
crew
now
dispersed
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
and
beyond
other
streams
played
a
part
in
the
education
of
that
happy
boy
the
kaaterskill
where
there
had
been
nothing
but
the
ghosts
of
trout
for
the
last
thirty
years
but
where
the
absence
of
fish
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
joy
of
a
first
introduction
to
dickens
one
very
showery
day
when
dear
old
ned
mason
built
a
smoky
fire
in
a
cave
below
haines
falls
and
pulling
the
old
curiosity
shop
out
of
his
pocket
read
aloud
about
little
nell
until
the
tears
ran
down
the
cheeks
of
reader
and
listener
the
smoke
was
so
thick
you
know
and
the
neversink
which
flows
through
john
burroughs
country
and
past
one
house
in
particular
perched
on
a
high
bluff
where
a
very
dreadful
old
woman
come
out
and
throws
stones
at
city
fellers
fishin
through
her
land
as
if
any
one
wanted
to
touch
her
land
it
was
the
water
that
ran
over
it
you
see
that
carried
the
fish
with
it
and
they
were
not
hers
at
all
and
the
stream
at
healing
springs
in
the
virginia
mountains
where
the
medicinal
waters
flow
down
into
a
lovely
wild
brook
without
injuring
the
health
of
the
trout
in
the
least
and
where
the
only
drawback
to
the
angler
happiness
is
the
abundance
of
rattlesnakes
but
a
boy
does
not
mind
such
things
as
that
he
feels
as
if
he
were
immortal
over
all
these
streams
memory
skips
lightly
and
strikes
a
trail
through
the
woods
to
the
adirondacks
where
the
boy
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
navigable
rivers
that
is
to
say
rivers
which
are
traversed
by
canoes
and
but
not
yet
defiled
by
steamboats
and
slept
or
rather
lay
awake
for
the
first
time
on
a
bed
of
in
a
tent
iii
the
promotion
from
picnics
to
a
two
weeks
is
like
going
from
school
to
college
by
this
time
a
natural
process
of
evolution
has
raised
the
first
rod
to
something
lighter
and
more
flexible
a
so
to
speak
but
not
a
bigoted
one
just
a
serviceable
unprejudiced
article
not
above
using
any
kind
of
bait
that
may
be
necessary
to
catch
the
fish
the
father
has
received
the
new
title
of
governor
indicating
not
less
but
more
authority
and
has
called
in
new
instructors
to
carry
on
the
boy
education

guides

last
and
laziest

better

be
discovered
for
later
trips
but
none
more
amusing
and
none
whose
woodcraft
seems
more
wonderful
than
that
of
this
queerly
matched
team
as
they
make
the
first
camp
in
a
pelting
on
the
shore
of
big
clear
pond
the
pitching
of
the
tents
is
a
lesson
in
architecture
the
building
of

victory
over
damp
nature
and
the
supper
of
potatoes
and
bacon
and

a
veritable
triumph

at
midnight
the
rain
is
pattering
persistently
on

closed
and
tied
together
the

through

down

rolled
up
in

it
is
a
very
long
night
for

noise
outside

probably
some
small
creature
a
squirrel
or
a
rabbit

would
be
good
for

but
it
sounds
louder
now
almost
loud
enough
to
be
a
fox
there
are
no
wolves
left
in
the
adirondacks
or
at
least
only
a
very
few
that
is
certainly
quite
a
heavy
footstep

around

step
very
softly
for
their

perhaps
sam
dunning
told
about

just
below

ah
my
boy
you
will
soon
learn
that
there
is
no
spot
in
all
the
forests
created
by
a
bountiful
providence
so
poor
as
to
be
without
its
bear
story
where
was
the
rifle
put
there
it
is
at
the
foot
of
the
wonder
if
it
is
loaded
the

springs
from
his
blankets
like
a
cat
and
peeps
out
between
the
there
sits
enos
in
the
shelter
of
a
leaning
tree
by
the
fire
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
a
bottle
poised
at
his
mouth
his
lonely
eye
is
cocked
up
at
a
great
horned
owl
on
the
branch
above
him
again
the
sudden
voice
breaks
out
whoo
whoo
whoo
cooks
for
you
all
enos
puts
the
bottle
down
with
a
grunt
and
creeps
off
to

mutters
how
he
know
i
cook
for
dis
camp
how
he
know

ugh
there
are
hundreds
of
pictures
that
flash
into
light
as
the
boy
goes
on
his
course
year
after
year
through
the
woods
there
is
the
luxurious
camp
on
tupper
lake
with
its
log
cabins
in
the
and
its
regiment
of
hungry
men
who
ate
almost
a
deer
a
day
and
there
is
the
little
bark
shelter
on
the
side
of
mount
marcy
where
the
governor
and
the
boy
with
baskets
full
of
trout
from
the
opalescent
river
are
spending
the
night
with
nothing
but
a
fire
to
keep
them
warm
there
is
the
north
bay
at
moosehead
with
joe
la
croix
one
more
frenchman
who
thinks
he
looks
like
napoleon
posing
on
the
rocks
beside
his
canoe
and
only
reconciled
by
his
vanity
to
the
wasteful
pastime
of
taking
photographs
while
the
big
fish
are
rising
gloriously
out
at
the
end
of
the
point
there
is
the
small
beside
the
saranac
river
where
pliny
robbins
and
the
boy
caught
noble
trout
weighing
from
one
to
three
pounds
apiece
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
august
afternoon
and
hid
themselves
in
the
bushes
when
ever
they
heard
a
party
coming
down
the
river
because
they
did
not
care
to
attract
company
and
there
are
the
middle
falls
where
the
governor
stood
on
a
long
spruce
log
taking
fish
with
the
fly
and
stepping
out
at
every
cast
a
little
nearer
to
the
end
of
the
log
until
it
slowly
tipped
with
him
and
he
settled
down
into
the
river
among
such
scenes
as
these
the
boy
pursued
his
education
learning
many
things
that
are
not
taught
in
colleges
learning
to
take
the
weather
as
it
comes
wet
or
dry
and
fortune
as
it
falls
good
or
bad
learning
that
a
meal
which
is
scanty
fare
for
one
becomes
a
banquet
for
two
provided
the
other
is
the
right
person
learning
that
there
is
some
skill
in
everything
even
in
digging
bait
and
that
what
is
called
luck
consists
chiefly
in
having
your
tackle
in
good
order
learning
that
a
man
can
be
just
as
happy
in
a
log
shanty
as
in
a
brownstone
mansion
and
that
the
very
best
pleasures
are
those
that
do
not
leave

bad
taste
in
the
mouth
and
in
all
this
the
governor
was
his
best
teacher
and
his
closest
comrade
dear
governor
you
have
gone
out
of
the
wilderness
now
and
your
steps
will
be
no
more
beside
these
remembered
little
rivers
no
more
forever
and
forever
you
will
not
come
in
sight
around
any
bend
of
this
clear
swiftwater
stream
where
you
made
your
last
cast
your
cheery
voice
will
never
again
ring
out
through
the
deepening
twilight
where
you
are
lingering
for
your
disciple
to
catch
up
with
you
he
will
never
again
hear
you
call
hallo
my
boy
what
luck
time
to
go
home
but
there
is
a
river
in
the
country
where
you
have
gone
is
there
not
a
river
with
trees
growing
all
along
it
evergreen
trees
and
somewhere
by
those
shady
banks
within
sound
of
clear
running
waters
i
think
you
will
be
dreaming
and
waiting
for
your
boy
if
he
follows
the
trail
that
you
have
shown
him
even
to
the
end
ampersand
it
is
not
the
walking
merely
it
is
keeping
yourself
in
tune
for
a
walk
in
the
spiritual
and
bodily
condition
in
which
you
can
find
entertainment
and
exhilaration
in
so
simple
and
natural
a
pastime
you
are
eligible
to
any
good
fortune
when
you
are
in
a
condition
to
enjoy
a
walk
when
the
air
and
water
taste
sweet
to
you
how
much
else
will
taste
sweet
when
the
exercise
of
your
limbs
affords
you
pleasure
and
the
play
of
your
senses
upon
the
various
objects
and
shows
of
nature
quickens
and
stimulates
your
spirit
your
relation
to
the
world
and
to
yourself
is
what
it
should
be
simple
and
direct
and
wholesome
john

pepacton
the
right
to
the
name
of
ampersand
like
the
territory
of
gaul
in
those
commentaries
which
julius
caesar
wrote
for
the
punishment
of
schoolboys
is
divided
into
three
parts
it
belongs
to
a
mountain
and
a
lake
and
a
little
river
the
mountain
stands
in
the
heart
of
the
adirondack
country
just
near
enough
to
the
thoroughfare
of
travel
for
thousands
of
people
to
see
it
every
year
and
just
far
enough
from
the
beaten
track
to
be
unvisited
except
by
a
very
few
of
the
wise
ones
who
love
to
turn
aside
behind
the
mountain
is
the
lake
which
no
lazy
man
has
ever
seen
out
of
the
lake
flows
the
stream
winding
down
a
long
untrodden
forest
valley
to
join
the
stony
creek
waters
and
empty
into
the
raquette
river
which
of
the
three
ampersands
has
the
prior
claim
to
the
name
i
can
not
tell
philosophically
speaking
the
mountain
ought
to
be
regarded
as
the
head
of
the
family
because
it
was
undoubtedly
there
before
the
others
and
the
lake
was
probably
the
next
on
the
ground
because
the
stream
is
its
child
but
man
is
not
strictly
just
in
his
nomenclature
and
i
conjecture
that
the
little
river
the
of
the
three
was
the
first
to
be
christened
ampersand
and
then
gave
its
name
to
its
parent
and
it
is
such
a
crooked
stream
so
bent
and
curved
and
twisted
upon
itself
so
fond
of
turning
around
unexpected
corners
and
sweeping
away
in
great
circles
from
its
direct
course
that
its
first
explorers
christened
it
after
the
eccentric
supernumerary
of
the
alphabet
which
appears
in
the
old
as
and
per
se
and
but
in
spite
of
this
apparent
subordination
to
the
stream
in
the
matter
of
a
name
the
mountain
clearly
asserts
its
natural
authority
it
stands
up
boldly
and
not
only
its
own
lake
but
at
least
three
others
the
lower
saranac
round
lake
and
lonesome
pond
lie
at
its
foot
and
acknowledge
its
lordship
when
the
cloud
is
on
its
brow
they
are
dark
when
the
sunlight
strikes
it
they
smile
wherever
you
may
go
over
the
waters
of
these
lakes
you
shall
see
mount
ampersand
looking
down
at
you
and
saying
quietly
this
is
my
domain
i
never
look
at
a
mountain
which
asserts
itself
in
this
fashion
without
desiring
to
stand
on
the
top
of
it
if
one
can
reach
the
summit
one
becomes
a
sharer
in
the
dominion
the
difficulties
in
the
way
only
add
to
the
zest
of
the
victory
every
mountain
is
rightly
considered
an
invitation
to
climb
and
as
i
was
resting
for
a
month
one
summer
at
bartlett
ampersand
challenged
me
daily
did
you
know
bartlett
in
its
palmy
time
it
was
the
homeliest
quaintest
coziest
place
in
the
adirondacks
away
back
in
the
days
virgil
bartlett
had
come
into
the
woods
and
built
his
house
on
the
bank
of
the
saranac
river
between
the
upper
saranac
and
round
lake
it
was
then
the
only
dwelling
within
a
circle
of
many
miles
the
deer
and
bear
were
in
the
majority
at
night
one
could
sometimes
hear
the
scream
of
the
panther
or
the
howling
of
wolves
but
soon
the
wilderness
began
to
wear
the
traces
of
a
conventional
smile
the
desert
blossomed
a
little
if
not
as
the
rose
at
least
as
the
fields
were
cleared
gardens
planted
half
a
dozen
log
cabins
were
scattered
along
the
river
and
the
old
house
having
grown
slowly
and
somewhat
irregularly
for
twenty
years
came
out
just
before
the
time
of
which
i
write
in
a
modest
coat
of
paint
and
a
piazza
but
virgil
himself
the
creator
of
the
oasis
well
known
of
hunters
and
fishermen
dreaded
of
lazy
guides
and
quarrelsome
lumbermen
virge
the
irascible
indefatigable
was
there
no
longer
he
had
made
his
last
clearing
and
fought
his
last
fight
done
his
last
favour
to
a
friend
and
thrown
his
last
adversary
out
of
the
tavern
door
his
last
log
had
gone
down
the
river
his
had
burned
out
peace
to
his
ashes
his
wife
who
had
often
played
the
part
of
abigail
toward
travellers
who
had
unconsciously
incurred
the
old
man
mistrust
now
reigned
in
his
stead
and
there
was
great
abundance
of
on
every
man
flapjack
the
charm
of
bartlett
for
the
angler
was
the
stretch
of
rapid
water
in
front
of
the
house
the
saranac
river
breaking
from
its
first
in
the
upper
lake
plunged
down
through
a
great
bed
of
rocks
making
a
chain
of
short
falls
and
pools
and
rapids
about
half
a
mile
in
length
here
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
the
speckled
trout
brightest
and
daintiest
of
all
fish
that
swim
used
to
be
found
in
great
numbers
as
the
season
advanced
they
moved
away
into
the
deep
water
of
the
lakes
but
there
were
always
a
few
stragglers
left
and
i
have
taken
them
in
the
rapids
at
the
very
end
of
august
what
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
the
early
morning
or
evening
of
a
hot
day
in
wading
this
rushing
stream
and
casting
the
fly
on
its
clear
waters
the
wind
blows
softly
down
the
narrow
valley
and
the
trees
nod
from
the
rocks
above
you
the
noise
of
the
falls
makes
constant
music
in
your
ears
the
river
hurries
past
you
and
yet
it
is
never
gone
the
same
seem
to
be
always
gliding
downward
the
same
spray
dashing
over
the
stones
the
same
eddy
coiling
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
send
your
fly
in
under
those
cedar
branches
where
the
water
swirls
around
by
that
old
log
now
draw
it
up
toward
the
foam
there
is
a
sudden
gleam
of
dull
gold
in
the
white
water
you
strike
too
soon
your
line
comes
back
to
you
in
a
current
like
this
a
fish
will
almost
always
hook
himself
try
it
again
this
time
he
takes
the
fly
fairly
and
you
have
him
it
is
a
good
fish
and
he
makes
the
slender
rod
bend
to
the
strain
he
sulks
for
a
moment
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
and
then
with
a
rush
darts
into
the
swiftest
part
of
the
current
you
can
never
stop
him
there
let
him
go
keep
just
enough
pressure
on
him
to
hold
the
hook
firm
and
follow
his
troutship
down
the
stream
as
if
he
were
a
salmon
he
slides
over
a
little
fall
gleaming
through
the
foam
and
swings
around
in
the
next
pool
here
you
can
manage
him
more
easily
and
after
a
few
minutes
brilliant
play
a
few
mad
dashes
for
the
current
he
comes
to
the
net
and
your
skilful
guide
lands
him
with
a
quick
steady
sweep
of
the
arm
the
scales
credit
him
with
an
even
pound
and
a
better
fish
than
this
you
will
hardly
take
here
in
midsummer
on
my
word
master
says
the
appreciative
venator
in
angler
this
is
a
gallant
trout
what
shall
we
do
with
him
and
honest
piscator
replies
marry
eat
him
to
supper
we
go
to
my
hostess
from
whence
we
came
she
told
me
as
i
was
going
out
of
door
that
my
brother
peter
and
who
is
this
but
romeyn
of
keeseville
a
good
angler
and
a
cheerful
companion
had
sent
word
he
would
lodge
there
tonight
and
bring
a
friend
with
him
my
hostess
has
two
beds
and
i
know
you
and
i
have
the
best
we
rejoice
with
my
brother
peter
and
his
friend
tell
tales
or
sing
ballads
or
make
a
catch
or
find
some
harmless
sport
to
content
us
and
pass
away
a
little
time
without
offence
to
god
or
man
ampersand
waited
immovable
while
i
passed
many
days
in
such
innocent
and
healthful
pleasures
as
these
until
the
right
day
came
for
the
ascent
cool
clean
and
bright
the
crystal
morning
promised
a
glorious
noon
and
the
mountain
almost
seemed
to
beckon
us
to
come
up
higher
the
photographic
camera
and
a
trustworthy
lunch
were
stowed
away
in
the
the
backboard
was
adjusted
at
a
comfortable
angle
in
the
stern
seat
of
our
little
boat
the
guide
held
the
little
craft
steady
while
i
stepped
into
my
place
then
he
pushed
out
into
the
stream
and
we
went
swiftly
down
toward
round
lake
a
saranac
boat
is
one
of
the
finest
things
that
the
skill
of
man
has
ever
produced
under
the
inspiration
of
the
wilderness
it
is
a
frail
shell
so
light
that
a
guide
can
carry
it
on
his
shoulders
with
ease
but
so
dexterously
fashioned
that
it
rides
the
heaviest
waves
like
a
duck
and
slips
through
the
water
as
if
by
magic
you
can
travel
in
it
along
the
shallowest
rivers
and
across
the
broadest
lakes
and
make
forty
or
fifty
miles
a
day
if
you
have
a
good
guide
everything
depends
in
the
adirondacks
as
in
so
many
other
regions
of
life
upon
your
guide
if
he
is
selfish
or
surly
or
stupid
you
will
have
a
bad
time
but
if
he
is
an
adirondacker
of
the
best
type
now
unhappily
growing
more
rare
from
year
to
year
you
will
find
him
an
inimitable
companion
honest
faithful
skilful
and
cheerful
he
is
as
independent
as
a
prince
and
the
gilded
youths
and
finicking
fine
ladies
who
attempt
to
patronise
him
are
apt
to
make
but
a
sorry
show
before
his
solid
and
undisguised
contempt
but
deal
with
him
man
to
man
and
he
will
give
you
a
friendly
loyal
service
which
money
can
not
buy
and
teach
you
secrets
of
woodcraft
and
lessons
in
plain
manhood
more
valuable
than
all
the
learning
of
the
schools
such
a
guide
was
mine
rejoicing
in
the
scriptural
name
of
hosea
but
commonly
called
in
brevity
and
friendliness
hose
as
we
entered
round
lake
on
this
fair
morning
its
surface
was
as
smooth
and
shining
as
a
mirror
it
was
too
early
yet
for
the
tide
of
travel
which
sends
a
score
of
boats
up
and
down
this
thoroughfare
every
day
and
from
shore
to
shore
the
water
was
unruffled
except
by
a
flock
of
sheldrakes
which
had
been
feeding
near
plymouth
rock
and
now
went
skittering
off
into
weller
bay
with
a
motion
between
flying
and
swimming
leaving
a
long
wake
of
foam
behind
them
at
such
a
time
as
this
you
can
see
the
real
colour
of
these
adirondack
lakes
it
is
not
blue
as
romantic
writers
so
often
describe
it
nor
green
like
some
of
those
wonderful
swiss
lakes
although
of
course
it
reflects
the
colour
of
the
trees
along
the
shore
and
when
the
wind
stirs
it
it
gives
back
the
hue
of
the
sky
blue
when
it
is
clear
gray
when
the
clouds
are
gathering
and
sometimes
as
black
as
ink
under
the
shadow
of
storm
but
when
it
is
still
the
water
itself
is
like
that
river
which
one
of
the
poets
has
described
as
flowing
with
a
smooth
brown
current
and
in
this
sheet
of
burnished
bronze
the
mountains
and
islands
were
reflected
perfectly
and
the
sun
shone
back
from
it
not
in
broken
gleams
or
a
wide
lane
of
light
but
like
a
single
ball
of
fire
moving
before
us
as
we
moved
but
stop
what
is
that
dark
speck
on
the
water
away
down
toward
turtle
point
it
has
just
the
shape
and
size
of
a
deer
head
it
seems
to
move
steadily
out
into
the
lake
there
is
a
little
ripple
like
a
wake
behind
it
hose
turns
to
look
at
it
and
then
sends
the
boat
darting
in
that
direction
with
long
swift
strokes
it
is
a
moment
of
pleasant
excitement
and
we
begin
to
conjecture
whether
the
deer
is
a
buck
or
a
doe
and
whose
hounds
have
driven
it
in
but
when
hose
turns
to
look
again
he
slackens
his
stroke
and
says
i
guess
we
need
to
hurry
he
wo
get
away
it
astonishin
what
a
lot
of
fun
a
man
can
get
in
the
course
of
a
natural
life
chumps
of
wood
we
landed
on
a
sand
beach
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
stream
where
a
blazed
tree
marked
the
beginning
of
the
ampersand
trail
this
line
through
the
forest
was
made
years
ago
by
that
ardent
sportsman
and
lover
of
the
adirondacks
ely
of
rochester
since
that
time
it
has
been
shortened
and
improved
a
little
by
other
travellers
and
also
not
a
little
blocked
and
confused
by
the
lumbermen
and
the
course
of
nature
for
when
the
lumbermen
go
into
the
woods
they
cut
roads
in
every
direction
leading
nowhither
and
the
unwary
wanderer
is
thereby
led
aside
from
the
right
way
and
entangled
in
the
undergrowth
and
as
for
nature
she
is
entirely
opposed
to
continuance
of
paths
through
her
forest
she
covers
them
with
fallen
leaves
and
hides
them
with
thick
bushes
she
drops
great
trees
across
them
and
blots
then
out
with
windfalls
but
the
blazed
line
a
succession
of
broad
on
the
trunks
of
the
trees
just
high
enough
to
catch
the
eye
on
a
level
can
not
be
so
easily
obliterated
and
this
after
all
is
the
safest
guide
through
the
woods
our
trail
led
us
at
first
through
a
natural
meadow
overgrown
with
grass
and
very
spongy
to
the
tread
also
was
this
meadow
and
therefore
no
place
for
idle
dalliance
or
unwary
digression
for
the
sting
of
the
hornet
is
one
of
the
saddest
and
most
humiliating
surprises
of
this
mortal
life
then
through
a
tangle
of
old
my
guide
led
me
safely
and
we
struck
one
of
the
long
ridges
which
slope
gently
from
the
lake
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
here
walking
was
comparatively
easy
for
in
the
timber
there
is
little
underbrush
the
massive
trunks
seemed
like
pillars
set
to
uphold
the
level
roof
of
green
great
yellow
birches
shaggy
with
age
stretched
their
knotted
arms
high
above
us
stood
up
straight
and
proud
under
their
leafy
crowns
and
smooth
beeches
the
most
polished
and
parklike
of
all
the
forest
trees
offered
opportunities
for
the
carving
of
lovers
names
in
a
place
where
few
lovers
ever
come
the
woods
were
quiet
it
seemed
as
if
all
living
creatures
had
deserted
them
indeed
if
you
have
spent
much
time
in
our
northern
forests
you
must
have
often
wondered
at
the
sparseness
of
life
and
felt
a
sense
of
pity
for
the
apparent
loneliness
of
the
squirrel
that
chatters
at
you
as
you
pass
or
the
little
bird
that
hops
noiselessly
about
in
the
thickets
the
midsummer
noontide
is
an
especially
silent
time
the
deer
are
asleep
in
some
wild
meadow
the
partridge
has
gathered
her
brood
for
their
midday
nap
the
squirrels
are
perhaps
counting
over
their
store
of
nuts
in
a
hollow
tree
and
the
spares
his
voice
until
evening
the
woods
are
close
not
cool
and
fragrant
as
the
foolish
romances
describe
them
but
warm
and
still
for
the
breeze
which
sweeps
across
the
hilltop
and
ruffles
the
lake
does
not
penetrate
into
these
shady
recesses
and
therefore
all
the
inhabitants
take
the
noontide
as
their
hour
of
rest
only
the
big
woodpecker
he
of
the
scarlet
head
and
mighty
bill
is
indefatigable
and
somewhere
unseen
is
tapping
the
hollow
while
a
wakeful
little
bird
i
guess
it
is
the
green
warbler
prolongs
his
dreamy
listless
ditty
wait
after
about
an
hour
of
easy
walking
our
trail
began
to
ascend
more
sharply
we
passed
over
the
shoulder
of
a
ridge
and
around
the
edge
of
a
and
then
we
had
the
mountain
fairly
before
us
not
that
we
could
see
anything
of
it
for
the
woods
still
shut
us
in
but
the
path
became
very
steep
and
we
knew
that
it
was
a
straight
climb
not
up
and
down
and
round
about
did
this
most
uncompromising
trail
proceed
but
right
up
in
a
direct
line
for
the
summit
now
this
side
of
ampersand
is
steeper
than
any
gothic
roof
i
have
ever
seen
and
withal
very
much
encumbered
with
rocks
and
ledges
and
fallen
trees
there
were
places
where
we
had
to
haul
ourselves
up
by
roots
and
branches
and
places
where
we
had
to
go
down
on
our
hands
and
knees
to
crawl
under
logs
it
was
breathless
work
but
not
at
all
dangerous
or
difficult
every
step
forward
was
also
a
step
upward
and
as
we
stopped
to
rest
for
a
moment
we
could
see
already
glimpses
of
the
lake
below
us
but
at
these
i
did
not
much
care
to
look
for
i
think
it
is
a
pity
to
spoil
the
surprise
of
a
grand
view
by
taking
little
snatches
of
it
beforehand
it
is
better
to
keep
one
face
set
to
the
mountain
and
then
coming
out
from
the
dark
forest
upon
the
very
summit
feel
the
splendour
of
the
outlook
flash
upon
one
like
a
revelation
the
character
of
the
woods
through
which
we
were
now
passing
was
entirely
different
from
those
of
the
lower
levels
on
these
steep
places
the
birch
and
maple
will
not
grow
or
at
least
they
occur
but
sparsely
the
higher
slopes
and
sharp
ridges
of
the
mountains
are
always
covered
with
timber
spruce
and
hemlock
and
balsam
strike
their
roots
among
the
rocks
and
find
a
hidden
nourishment
they
stand
close
together
thickets
of
small
trees
spring
up
among
the
large
ones
from
year
to
year
the
great
trunks
are
falling
one
across
another
and
the
undergrowth
is
thickening
around
them
until
a
spruce
forest
seems
to
be
almost
impassable
the
constant
rain
of
needles
and
the
crumbling
of
the
fallen
trees
form
a
rich
brown
mould
into
which
the
foot
sinks
noiselessly
wonderful
beds
of
moss
many
feet
in
thickness
and
softer
than
feathers
cover
the
rocks
and
roots
there
are
shadows
never
broken
by
the
sun
and
dark
cool
springs
of
icy
water
hidden
away
in
the
crevices
you
feel
a
sense
of
antiquity
here
which
you
can
never
feel
among
the
maples
and
birches
longfellow
was
right
when
he
filled
his
forest
primeval
with
murmuring
pines
and
hemlocks
the
higher
one
climbs
the
darker
and
gloomier
and
more
rugged
the
vegetation
becomes
the
soon
cease
to
follow
you
the
hemlocks
disappear
and
the
balsams
can
go
no
farther
only
the
hardy
spruce
keeps
on
bravely
rough
and
stunted
with
branches
matted
together
and
pressed
down
flat
by
the
weight
of
the
winter
snow
until
finally
somewhere
about
the
level
of
four
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
even
this
bold
climber
gives
out
and
the
rocks
of
the
summit
are
clad
only
with
mosses
and
alpine
plants
thus
it
is
with
mountains
as
perhaps
with
men
a
mark
of
superior
dignity
to
be
naturally
bald
ampersand
falling
short
by
a
thousand
feet
of
the
needful
height
can
not
claim
this
distinction
but
what
nature
has
denied
human
labour
has
supplied
under
the
direction
of
the
adirondack
survey
some
years
ago
several
acres
of
trees
were
cut
from
the
summit
and
when
we
emerged
after
the
last
sharp
scramble
upon
the
very
crest
of
the
mountain
we
were
not
shut
in
by
a
dense
thicket
but
stood
upon
a
bare
ridge
of
granite
in
the
centre
of
a
ragged
clearing
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
moment
drew
a
few
long
breaths
of
the
glorious
breeze
and
then
looked
out
upon
a
wonder
and
a
delight
beyond
description
a
soft
dazzling
splendour
filled
the
air
snowy
banks
and
drifts
of
cloud
were
floating
slowly
over
a
wide
and
wondrous
land
vast
sweeps
of
forest
shining
waters
mountains
near
and
far
the
deepest
green
and
the
palest
blue
changing
colours
and
glancing
lights
and
all
so
silent
so
strange
so
far
away
that
it
seemed
like
the
landscape
of
a
dream
one
almost
feared
to
speak
lest
it
should
vanish
right
below
us
the
lower
saranac
and
lonesome
pond
round
lake
and
the
weller
ponds
were
spread
out
like
a
map
every
point
and
island
was
clearly
marked
we
could
follow
the
course
of
the
saranac
river
in
all
its
curves
and
windings
and
see
the
white
tents
of
the
on
the
wild
meadows
far
away
to
the
northeast
stretched
the
level
fields
of
bloomingdale
but
westward
all
was
unbroken
wilderness
a
great
sea
of
woods
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
how
far
it
can
reach
from
a
height
like
this
what
a
revelation
of
the
power
of
sight
that
faint
blue
outline
far
in
the
north
was
lyon
mountain
nearly
thirty
miles
away
as
the
crow
flies
those
silver
gleams
a
little
nearer
were
the
waters
of
regis
the
upper
saranac
was
displayed
in
all
its
length
and
breadth
and
beyond
it
the
innumerable
waters
of
fish
creek
were
tangled
among
the
dark
woods
the
long
ranges
of
the
hills
about
the
jordan
bounded
the
western
horizon
and
on
the
southwest
big
tupper
lake
was
sleeping
at
the
base
of
mount
morris
looking
past
the
peak
of
stony
creek
mountain
which
rose
sharp
and
distinct
in
a
line
with
ampersand
we
could
trace
the
path
of
the
raquette
river
from
the
distant
waters
of
long
lake
down
through
its
valley
and
catch
here
and
there
a
silvery
link
of
its
current
but
when
we
turned
to
the
south
and
east
how
wonderful
and
how
different
was
the
view
here
was
no
widespread
and
smiling
landscape
with
gleams
of
silver
scattered
through
it
and
soft
blue
haze
resting
upon
its
fading
verge
but
a
wild
land
of
mountains
stern
rugged
tumultuous
rising
one
beyond
another
like
the
waves
of
a
stormy
ocean
ossa
piled
upin
pelion
mcintyre
sharp
peak
and
the
ragged
crest
of
the
gothics
and
above
all
marcy
head
raised
just
far
enough
above
the
others
to
assert
his
royal
right
as
monarch
of
the
adirondacks
but
grandest
of
all
as
seen
from
this
height
was
mount
seward
a
solemn
giant
of
a
mountain
standing
apart
from
the
others
and
looking
us
full
in
the
face
he
was
clothed
from
base
to
summit
in
a
dark
unbroken
robe
of
forest
the
indians
called
him
the
great
eye
and
he
seemed
almost
to
frown
upon
us
in
defiance
at
his
feet
so
straight
below
us
that
it
seemed
almost
as
if
we
could
cast
a
stone
into
it
lay
the
wildest
and
most
beautiful
of
all
the
adirondack
waters
ampersand
lake
on
its
shore
some
years
ago
the
now
almost
forgotten
adirondack
club
had
their
shanty
the
successor
of
the
camp
on
follensbee
pond
agassiz
appleton
norton
emerson
lowell
hoar
gray
john
holmes
and
stillman
were
among
the
company
who
made
their
under
the
shadow
of
mount
seward
they
had
bought
a
tract
of
forest
land
completely
encircling
the
pond
cut
a
rough
road
to
it
through
the
woods
and
built
a
comfortable
log
cabin
to
which
they
purposed
to
return
summer
after
summer
but
the
civil
war
broke
out
with
all
its
terrible
excitement
and
confusion
of
hurrying
hosts
the
club
existed
but
for
two
years
and
the
little
house
in
the
wilderness
was
abandoned
in
when
i
spent
three
weeks
at
ampersand
the
cabin
was
in
ruins
and
surrounded
by
an
almost
impenetrable
growth
of
bushes
the
only
philosophers
to
be
seen
were
a
family
of
what
the
guides
quaintly
call
quill
pigs
the
roof
had
fallen
to
the
ground
thrust
themselves
through
the
yawning
crevices
between
the
logs
and
in
front
of
the
sunken
lay
a
rusty
broken
iron
stove
like
a
dismantled
altar
on
which
the
fire
had
gone
out
forever
after
we
had
feasted
upon
the
view
as
long
as
we
dared
counted
the
lakes
and
streams
and
found
that
we
could
see
without
a
glass
more
than
thirty
and
recalled
the
memories
of
good
times
which
came
to
us
from
almost
every
point
of
the
compass
we
unpacked
the
camera
and
proceeded
to
take
some
pictures
if
you
are
a
photographer
and
have
anything
of
the
amateur
passion
for
your
art
you
will
appreciate
my
pleasure
and
my
anxiety
never
before
so
far
as
i
knew
had
a
camera
been
set
up
on
ampersand
i
had
but
eight
plates
with
me
the
views
were
all
very
distant
and
all
at
a
downward
angle
the
power
of
the
light
at
this
elevation
was
an
unknown
quantity
and
the
wind
was
sweeping
vigorously
across
the
open
summit
of
the
mountain
i
put
in
my
smallest
stop
and
prepared
for
short
exposures
my
instrument
was
a
thing
called
a
tourograph
which
differs
from
most
other
cameras
in
having
the
on
top
of
the
box
the
plates
are
dropped
into
a
groove
below
and
then
moved
into
focus
after
which
the
cap
is
removed
and
the
exposure
made
i
set
my
instrument
for
ampersand
pond
sighted
the
picture
through
the
ground
glass
and
measured
the
focus
then
i
waited
for
a
quiet
moment
dropped
the
plate
moved
it
carefully
forward
to
the
proper
mark
and
went
around
to
take
off
the
cap
i
found
that
i
already
had
it
in
my
hand
and
the
plate
had
been
exposed
for
about
thirty
seconds
with
a
sliding
focus
i
expostulated
with
myself
i
said
you
are
excited
you
are
stupid
you
are
unworthy
of
the
name
of
photographer
you
ought
to
write
with
a
the
reproof
was
effectual
and
from
that
moment
all
went
well
the
plates
dropped
smoothly
the
camera
was
steady
the
exposure
was
correct
six
good
pictures
were
made
to
recall
so
far
as
black
and
white
could
do
it
the
delights
of
that
day
it
has
been
my
good
luck
to
climb
many
of
the
peaks
of
the
adirondacks
dix
the
dial
hurricane
the
giant
of
the
valley
marcy
and
whiteface
but
i
do
not
think
the
outlook
from
any
of
them
is
so
wonderful
and
lovely
as
that
from
little
ampersand
and
i
reckon
among
my
most
valuable
chattels
the
plates
of
glass
on
which
the
sun
has
traced
for
me
who
can
not
draw
the
outlines
of
that
loveliest
landscape
the
downward
journey
was
swift
we
halted
for
an
hour
or
two
beside
a
trickling
spring
a
few
rods
below
the
summit
to
eat
our
lunch
then
jumping
running
and
sometimes
sliding
we
made
the
descent
passed
in
safety
by
the
dreaded
lair
of
the
hornet
and
reached
bartlett
as
the
fragrance
of
the
evening
pancake
was
softly
diffused
through
the
twilight
mark
that
day
memory
with
a
double
star
in
your
catalogue
a
handful
of
heather
scotland
is
the
home
of
romance
because
it
is
the
home
of
scott
burns
black
macdonald
stevenson
and
barrie
and
of
thousands
of
men
like
that
old
highlander
in
kilts
on
the
who
loves
what
they
have
written
i
would
wager
he
has
a
copy
of
burns
in
his
sporran
and
has
quoted
him
half
a
dozen
times
to
the
grim
celt
who
is
walking
with
him
those
old
boys
do
read
for
excitement
or
knowledge
but
because
they
love
their
land
and
their
people
and
their
religion
and
their
great
writers
simply
express
their
emotions
for
them
in
words
they
can
understand
you
and
i
come
over
here
with
thousands
of
our
countrymen
to
borrow
their
emotions
robert
bridges
overheard
in
arcady
my
friend
the
triumphant
democrat
fiercest
of
radicals
and
kindest
of
men
expresses
his
scorn
for
monarchical
institutions
and
his
invincible
love
for
his
native
scotland
by
tenanting
summer
after
summer
a
famous
castle
among
the
heathery
highlands
there
he
proclaims
the
most
uncompromising
americanism
in
a
speech
that
grows
more
broadly
scotch
with
every
week
of
his
emancipation
from
the
influence
of
the
clipped
commercial
accent
of
new
york
and
casts
contempt
on
feudalism
by
playing
the
part
of
lord
of
the
manor
to
such
a
perfection
of
beneficence
that
the
people
of
the
glen
are
all
become
his
clansmen
and
his
gentle
lady
would
be
the
patron
saint
of
the
district
if
the
republican
theology
of
scotland
could
only
admit
saints
among
the
elect
every
year
he
sends
trophies
of
game
to
his
friends
across
the
sea
birds
that
are
as
toothsome
and
as
if
they
had
not
been
hatched
under
the
tyranny
of
the
he
has
a
pleasant
trick
of
making
them
grateful
to
the
imagination
as
well
as
to
the
palate
by
packing
them
in
heather
i
warrant
that
aaron
rod
bore
no
bonnier
blossoms
than
these
stiff
little
bushes
and
none
more
magical
for
every
time
i
take
up
a
handful
of
them
they
transport
me
to
the
highlands
and
send
me
tramping
once
more
with
knapsack
and
over
the
braes
and
down
the
burns
some
of
my
happiest
meanderings
in
scotland
have
been
taken
under
the
lead
of
a
book
indeed
for
travel
in
a
strange
country
there
can
be
no
better
courier
not
a
i
mean
but
a
real
book
and
by
preference
a
novel
fiction
like
wine
tastes
best
in
the
place
where
it
was
grown
and
the
scenery
of
a
foreign
land
including
architecture
which
is
artificial
landscape
grows
less
dreamlike
and
unreal
to
our
perception
when
we
people
it
with
familiar
characters
from
our
favourite
novels
even
on
a
first
journey
we
feel
ourselves
among
old
friends
thus
to
read
romola
in
florence
and
les
miserables
in
paris
and
lorna
doone
on
exmoor
and
the
heart
of
midlothian
in
edinburgh
and
david
balfour
in
the
pass
of
glencoe
and
the
pirate
in
the
shetland
isles
is
to
get
a
new
sense
of
the
possibilities
of
life
all
these
things
have
i
done
with
much
inward
contentment
and
other
things
of
like
quality
have
i
yet
in
store
as
for
example
the
conjunction
of
the
bonnie
with
drumtochty
and
the
little
minister
with
thrums
and
the
raiders
with
galloway
but
i
never
expect
to
pass
pleasanter
days
than
those
i
spent
with
a
princess
of
thule
among
the
hebrides
for
then
to
begin
with
i
was
young
which
is
an
unearned
increment
of
delight
sure
to
be
confiscated
by
the
envious
years
and
never
regained
but
even
youth
itself
was
not
to
be
compared
with
the
exquisite
felicity
of
being
deeply
and
desperately
in
love
with
sheila
the
heroine
of
that
charming
book
in
this
innocent
passion
my
comrades
howard
crosby
the
chancellor
of
the
university
of
new
york
and
my
father
an
of
the
presbyterian
general
assembly
were
ardent
but
generous
rivals
how
great
is
the
joy
and
how
fascinating
the
pursuit
of
such
an
ethereal
affection
it
enlarges
the
heart
without
embarrassing
the
conscience
it
is
a
cup
of
pure
gladness
with
no
bitterness
in
its
dregs
it
spends
the
present
moment
with
a
free
hand
and
yet
leaves
no
undesirable
mortgage
upon
the
future
king
arthur
the
founder
of
the
round
table
expressed
a
conviction
according
to
tennyson
that
the
most
important
element
in
a
young
knight
education
is
the
maiden
passion
for
a
maid
surely
the
safest
form
in
which
this
course
in
the
curriculum
may
be
taken
is
by
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
in
a
book
it
is
the
only
affair
of
the
kind
into
which
a
young
fellow
can
enter
without
responsibility
and
out
of
which
he
can
always
emerge
when
necessary
without
discredit
and
as
for
the
old
fellow
who
still
keeps
up
this
education
of
the
heart
and
worships
his
heroine
with
the
ardour
of
a
john
ridd
and
the
fidelity
of
a
henry
esmond
i
maintain
that
he
is
exempt
from
all
the
penalties
of
declining
years
the
man
who
can
love
a
girl
in
a
book
may
be
old
but
never
aged
so
we
sailed
lovers
all
three
among
the
western
isles
and
whatever
ship
it
was
that
carried
us
her
figurehead
was
always
the
princess
sheila
along
the
ruffled
blue
waters
of
the
sounds
and
lochs
that
wind
among
the
roots
of
unpronounceable
mountains
and
past
the
dark
hills
of
skye
and
through
the
unnumbered
flocks
of
craggy
islets
where
the
nest
the
spell
of
the
sweet
highland
maid
drew
us
and
we
were
pilgrims
to
the
ultima
thule
where
she
lived
and
reigned
the
lewis
with
its
the
harris
is
quite
a
sizable
island
to
be
appended
to
such
a
country
as
scotland
it
is
a
number
of
miles
long
and
another
number
of
miles
wide
and
it
has
a
number
of
thousand
inhabitants
i
should
say
as
many
as
of
an
inhabitant
to
the
square
mile
and
the
conditions
of
agriculture
and
the
fisheries
are
extremely
interesting
and
quarrelsome
all
these
i
duly
studied
at
the
time
and
reported
in
a
series
of
intolerably
dull
letters
to
the
newspaper
which
supplied
a
financial
basis
for
my
sentimental
journey
they
are
full
of
information
but
i
have
been
amused
to
note
after
these
many
years
how
wide
they
steer
of
the
true
motive
and
interest
of
the
excursion
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
sheila
in
any
of
them
youth
after
all
is
a
shamefaced
and
secretive
season
like
the
fringed
polygala
it
hides
its
real
blossom
underground
it
was
sheila
dress
and
sailor
hat
with
the
white
feather
that
we
looked
for
as
we
loafed
through
the
streets
of
stornoway
that
quaint
metropolis
of
the
where
strings
of
fish
alternated
with
boxes
of
flowers
in
the
windows
and
handfuls
of
fish
were
spread
upon
the
roofs
to
dry
just
as
the
sliced
apples
are
exposed
upon
the
of
new
england
in
september
and
women
were
carrying
great
creels
of
fish
on
their
shoulders
and
groups
of
sunburned
men
were
smoking
among
the
on
the
beach
and
talking
about
fish
and
were
floating
over
the
houses
with
their
heads
turning
from
side
to
side
and
their
bright
eyes
peering
everywhere
for
unconsidered
trifles
of
fish
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
physical
mental
and
moral
was
pervaded
with
fish
it
was
sheila
soft
highland
speech
that
we
heard
through
the
long
luminous
twilight
in
the
pauses
of
that
friendly
chat
on
the
balcony
of
the
little
inn
where
a
good
fortune
brought
us
acquainted
with
sam
bough
the
mellow
edinburgh
painter
it
was
sheila
low
sweet
brow
and
long
black
eyelashes
and
tender
blue
eyes
that
we
saw
before
us
as
we
loitered
over
the
open
moorland
a
sea
of
brown
billows
reddened
with
patches
of
and
brightened
here
and
there
with
little
lakes
lying
wide
open
to
the
sky
and
were
not
these
with
the
big
baskets
on
their
backs
walking
in
silhouette
along
the
ridges
the
people
that
sheila
loved
and
tried
to
help
and
were
not
these
crofters
cottages
with
thatched
roofs
like
beehives
blending
almost
imperceptibly
with
the
landscape
the
dwellings
into
which
she
planned
to
introduce
the
luxury
of
windows
and
were
not
these
standing
stones
of
callernish
huge
tombstones
of
a
vanished
religion
the
roofless
temple
from
which
the
druids
paid
their
westernmost
adoration
to
the
setting
sun
as
he
sank
into
the
atlantic
was
not
this
the
place
where
sheila
picked
the
bunch
of
wild
flowers
and
gave
it
to
her
lover
there
is
nothing
in
history
i
am
sure
half
so
real
to
us
as
some
of
the
things
in
fiction
the
influence
of
an
event
upon
our
character
is
little
affected
by
considerations
as
to
whether
or
not
it
ever
happened
there
were
three
churches
in
stornoway
all
presbyterian
of
course
and
therefore
full
of
pious
emulation
the
idea
of
securing
an
american
preacher
for
an
august
sabbath
seemed
to
fall
upon
them
simultaneously
and
to
offer
the
prospect
of
novelty
without
too
much
danger
the
brethren
of
the
congregation
being
a
trifle
more
gleg
than
the
others
arrived
first
at
the
inn
and
secured
the
promise
of
a
morning
sermon
from
chancellor
howard
crosby
the
session
of
the
free
kirk
came
in
a
body
a
little
later
and
to
them
my
father
pledged
himself
for
the
evening
sermon
the
senior
elder
of
the
established
kirk
a
man
and
very
deliberate
was
the
last
to
appear
and
to
his
request
for
an
afternoon
sermon
there
was
nothing
left
to
offer
but
the
services
of
the
young
probationer
in
theology
i
could
see
that
it
struck
him
as
a
perilous
adventure
questions
about
the
fundamentals
glinted
in
his
watery
eye
he
crossed
and
uncrossed
his
legs
with
solemnity
and
blew
his
nose
so
frequently
in
a
huge
red
silk
handkerchief
that
it
seemed
like
a
signal
of
danger
at
last
he
unburdened
himself
of
his
hesitations
ah
not
saying
that
the
young
man
will
not
be
orthodox
ahem
but
ye
know
sir
in
the
kirk
we
are
not
using
hymns
but
just
the
pure
psawms
of
daffit
in
the
meetrical
fairsion
and
ye
know
sir
they
are
ferry
tifficult
in
the
reating
whatefer
for
a
young
man
and
one
that
iss
a
stranger
and
if
his
father
will
just
be
coming
with
him
in
the
pulpit
to
see
that
nothing
iss
said
amiss
that
will
be
ferry
comforting
to
the
congregation
so
the
dear
governor
swallowed
his
laughter
gravely
and
went
surety
for
his
son
they
appeared
together
in
the
church
a
barnlike
edifice
with
great
galleries
between
the
floor
and
the
roof
still
higher
up
the
pulpit
stuck
like
a
swallow
nest
against
the
wall
the
two
ministers
climbed
the
precipitous
stair
and
found
themselves
in
a
box
so
narrow
that
one
must
stand
perforce
while
the
other
sat
upon
the
only
seat
in
this
ride
and
tie
fashion
they
went
through
the
service
when
it
was
time
to
preach
the
young
man
dropped
the
doctrines
as
discreetly
as
possible
upon
the
upturned
countenances
beneath
him
i
have
forgotten
now
what
it
was
all
about
but
there
was
a
quotation
from
the
song
of
solomon
ending
with
sweet
is
thy
voice
and
thy
countenance
is
comely
and
when
it
came
to
that
the
probationer
eyes
if
the
truth
must
be
told
went
searching
through
that
sea
of
faces
for
one
that
should
be
familiar
to
his
heart
and
to
which
he
might
make
a
personal
application
of
the
scripture
passage
even
the
face
of
sheila
there
are
rivers
in
the
lewis
at
least
two
of
them
and
on
one
of
these
we
had
the
offer
of
a
rod
for
a
day
fishing
accordingly
we
cast
lots
and
the
lot
fell
upon
the
youngest
and
i
went
forth
with
a
tall
gillie
to
try
for
my
first
salmon
the
whitewater
came
singing
down
out
of
the
moorland
into
a
rocky
valley
and
there
was
a
merry
curl
of
air
on
the
pools
and
the
silver
fish
were
leaping
from
the
stream
the
gillie
handled
the
big
rod
as
if
it
had
been
a
wand
but
to
me
it
was
like
a
giant
spear
it
was
a
very
different
affair
from
fishing
with
five
ounces
of
split
bamboo
on
a
long
island
the
monstrous
fly
like
an
awkward
bird
went
fluttering
everywhere
but
in
the
right
direction
it
was
the
mercy
of
providence
that
preserved
the
gillie
life
but
he
was
very
patient
and
forbearing
leading
me
on
from
one
pool
to
another
as
i
spoiled
the
water
and
snatched
the
hook
out
of
the
mouth
of
rising
fish
until
at
last
we
found
a
salmon
that
knew
even
less
about
the
niceties
of
than
i
did
he
seized
the
fly
firmly
before
i
could
pull
it
away
and
then
in
a
moment
i
found
myself
attached
to
a
creature
with
the
strength
of
a
whale
and
the
agility
of
a
he
led
me
rushing
up
and
down
the
bank
like
a
madman
he
played
on
the
surface
like
a
whirlwind
and
sulked
at
the
bottom
like
a
stone
he
meditated
with
ominous
delay
in
the
middle
of
the
deepest
pool
and
then
darting
across
the
river
flung
himself
clean
out
of
water
and
landed
far
up
on
the
green
turf
of
the
opposite
shore
my
heart
melted
like
a
snowflake
in
the
sea
and
i
thought
that
i
had
lost
him
forever
but
he
rolled
quietly
back
into
the
water
with
the
hook
still
set
in
his
nose
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
brought
him
within
reach
of
the
gaff
and
my
first
salmon
was
glittering
on
the
grass
beside
me
then
i
remembered
that
william
black
had
described
this
very
fish
in
a
princess
of
thule
i
pulled
the
book
from
my
pocket
and
lighting
a
pipe
sat
down
to
read
that
delightful
chapter
over
again
the
breeze
played
softly
down
the
valley
the
warm
sunlight
was
filled
with
the
musical
hum
of
insects
and
the
murmur
of
falling
waters
i
thought
how
much
pleasanter
it
would
have
been
to
learn
as
hero
did
from
the
maid
of
borva
than
from
a
gillie
but
then
his
salmon
after
leaping
across
the
stream
got
away
whereas
mine
was
safe
a
man
can
not
have
everything
in
this
world
i
picked
a
spray
of
rosy
from
the
bank
of
the
river
and
pressed
it
between
the
leaves
of
the
book
in
memory
of
sheila
ii
common
heather
it
is
not
half
as
far
from
albany
to
aberdeen
as
it
is
from
new
york
to
london
in
fact
i
venture
to
say
that
an
american
on
foot
will
find
himself
less
a
foreigner
in
scotland
than
in
any
other
country
in
the
old
world
there
is
something
warm
and
hospitable
if
he
knew
the
language
well
enough
he
would
call
it
couthy
in
the
greeting
that
he
gets
from
the
shepherd
on
the
moor
and
the
conversation
that
he
holds
with
the
farmer
wife
in
the
stone
cottage
where
he
stops
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
milk
and
a
bit
of
he
feels
that
there
must
be
a
drop
of
scotch
somewhere
in
his
mingled
blood
or
at
least
that
the
texture
of
his
thought
and
feelings
has
been
partly
woven
on
a
scottish
loom
perhaps
the
shorter
catechism
or
robert
burns
poems
or
the
romances
of
sir
walter
scott
at
all
events
he
is
among
a
kindred
and
comprehending
people
they
do
not
speak
english
in
the
same
way
that
he
does
through
the
nose
they
think
very
much
more
in
his
mental
dialect
than
the
english
do
they
are
independent
and
wide
awake
curious
and
full
of
personal
interest
the
wayside
mind
in
inverness
or
perth
runs
more
to
muscle
and
less
to
fat
has
more
active
vanity
and
less
passive
pride
is
more
inquisitive
and
excitable
and
sympathetic
in
short
to
use
a
symbolist
description
it
is
more
apt
to
be
than
in
surrey
or
somerset
scotchmen
ask
more
questions
about
america
but
fewer
foolish
ones
you
will
never
hear
them
inquiring
whether
there
is
any
good
in
the
neighbourhood
of
boston
or
whether
shakespeare
is
much
read
in
the
states
they
have
a
healthy
respect
for
our
institutions
and
have
quite
forgiven
if
indeed
they
ever
resented
that
little
affair
in
they
are
all
born
liberals
when
a
scotchman
says
he
is
a
conservative
it
only
means
that
he
is
a
liberal
with
hesitations
and
yet
in
north
britain
the
american
pedestrian
will
not
find
that
amused
and
somewhat
condescending
toleration
for
his
peculiarities
that
placid
willingness
to
make
the
best
of
all
his
vagaries
of
speech
and
conduct
that
he
finds
in
south
britain
in
an
english
town
you
may
do
pretty
much
what
you
like
on
a
sunday
even
to
the
extent
of
wearing
a
billycock
hat
to
church
and
people
will
put
up
with
it
from
a
countryman
of
buffalo
bill
and
the
wild
west
show
but
in
a
scotch
village
if
you
whistle
in
the
street
on
a
lord
day
though
it
be
a
moody
and
sankey
tune
you
will
be
likely
to
get
as
i
did
an
admonition
from
some
grizzled
elder
young
man
do
ye
no
ken
it
the
sawbath
day
i
recognised
the
reproof
of
the
righteous
an
excellent
oil
which
doth
not
break
the
head
and
took
it
gratefully
at
the
old
man
hands
for
did
it
not
prove
that
he
regarded
me
as
a
man
and
a
brother
a
creature
capable
of
being
civilised
and
saved
it
was
in
the
gray
town
of
dingwall
that
i
had
this
bit
of
pleasant
correction
as
i
was
on
the
way
to
a
fishing
tramp
through
sutherlandshire
this
northwest
corner
of
great
britain
is
the
best
place
in
the
whole
island
for
a
modest
and
impecunious
angler
there
are
or
there
were
a
few
years
ago
wild
lochs
and
streams
which
are
still
practically
free
and
a
man
who
is
content
with
small
things
can
pick
up
some
very
pretty
sport
from
the
highland
inns
and
make
a
good
basket
of
memorable
experiences
every
week
the
inn
at
lairg
overlooking
the
narrow
waters
of
loch
shin
was
embowered
in
honeysuckles
and
full
of
creature
comfort
but
there
were
too
many
other
men
with
rods
there
to
suit
my
taste
the
feesh
in
this
loch
said
the
boatman
iss
not
so
numerous
ass
the
feeshermen
but
more
wise
there
iss
not
one
of
them
that
hass
not
felt
the
hook
and
they
know
ferry
well
what
side
of
the
fly
has
the
forkit
tail
at
altnaharra
in
the
shadow
of
ben
clebrig
there
was
a
cozy
little
house
with
good
fare
and
abundant
in
loch
naver
and
loch
meadie
it
was
there
that
i
fell
in
with
a
wandering
who
gathered
his
wares
from
the
mussels
in
the
moorland
streams
they
were
not
of
the
finest
quality
these
scotch
pearls
but
they
had
pretty
changeable
colours
of
pink
and
blue
upon
them
like
the
iridescent
light
that
plays
over
the
heather
in
the
long
northern
evenings
i
thought
it
must
be
a
hard
life
for
the
man
wading
day
after
day
in
the
water
and
groping
among
the
coggly
sliddery
stones
for
the
shellfish
and
cracking
open
perhaps
a
thousand
before
he
could
find
one
pearl
oh
yess
said
be
and
it
iss
not
an
easy
life
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it
will
be
so
warm
and
dry
ass
liffing
in
a
rich
house
but
it
iss
the
life
that
i
am
fit
for
and
i
hef
my
own
time
and
my
thoughts
to
mysel
and
that
is
a
ferry
goot
thing
and
then
sir
i
haf
found
the
pearl
of
great
price
and
i
think
upon
that
day
and
night
under
the
black
shattered
peaks
of
ben
laoghal
where
i
saw
an
eagle
poising
day
after
day
as
if
some
invisible
centripetal
force
bound
him
forever
to
that
small
circle
of
air
there
was
a
loch
with
plenty
of
brown
trout
and
a
few
salmo
ferox
and
down
at
tongue
there
was
a
little
river
where
the
sometimes
come
up
with
the
tide
here
i
found
myself
upon
the
north
coast
and
took
the
road
eastward
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
it
was
a
beautiful
region
of
desolation
there
were
rocky
glens
cutting
across
the
road
and
occasionally
a
brawling
stream
ran
down
to
the
salt
water
breaking
the
line
of
cliffs
with
a
little
bay
and
a
of
yellow
sand
the
heather
covered
all
the
hills
there
were
no
trees
and
but
few
houses
the
chief
signs
of
human
labour
were
the
rounded
piles
of
peat
and
the
square
cuttings
in
the
moor
marking
the
places
where
the
subterranean
had
gathered
their
harvests
the
long
straths
were
once
cultivated
and
every
patch
of
arable
land
had
its
group
of
cottages
full
of
children
the
human
harvest
has
always
been
the
richest
and
most
abundant
that
is
raised
in
the
highlands
but
unfortunately
the
supply
exceeded
the
demand
and
so
the
crofters
were
evicted
and
great
flocks
of
sheep
were
put
in
possession
of
the
land
and
now
the
have
been
changed
into
and
far
and
wide
along
the
valleys
and
across
the
hills
there
is
not
a
trace
of
habitation
except
the
heaps
of
stones
and
the
clumps
of
straggling
bushes
which
mark
the
sites
of
lost
homes
but
what
is
one
country
loss
is
another
country
gain
canada
and
the
united
states
are
infinitely
the
richer
for
the
tough
strong
fearless
honest
men
that
were
dispersed
from
these
lonely
straths
to
make
new
homes
across
the
sea
it
was
after
sundown
when
i
reached
the
straggling
village
of
melvich
and
the
long
day
journey
had
left
me
weary
but
the
inn
with
its
windows
looked
bright
and
reassuring
thoughts
of
dinner
and
a
good
bed
comforted
my
spirit
prematurely
for
the
inn
was
full
there
were
but
five
bedrooms
and
two
parlours
the
gentlemen
who
had
the
neighbouring
shootings
occupied
three
bedrooms
and
a
parlour
the
other
two
bedrooms
had
just
been
taken
by
the
english
fishermen
who
had
passed
me
in
the
road
an
hour
ago
in
the
oh
why
had
i
not
suspected
that
treacherous
vehicle
and
the
landlord
and
his
wife
assured
me
with
equal
firmness
and
sympathy
that
there
was
not
another
cot
or
pair
of
blankets
in
the
house
i
believed
them
and
was
sinking
into
despair
when
sandy
appeared
on
the
scene
as
my
angel
of
deliverance
sandy
was
a
small
withered
wiry
man
dressed
in
rusty
gray
with
an
immense
white
collar
thrusting
out
its
points
on
either
side
of
his
chin
and
a
black
stock
climbing
over
the
top
of
it
i
guessed
from
his
speech
that
he
had
once
lived
in
the
lowlands
he
had
hoped
to
be
engaged
as
a
gillie
by
the
shooting
party
but
had
been
disappointed
he
had
wanted
to
be
taken
by
the
english
fishermen
but
another
and
younger
man
had
stepped
in
before
him
now
sandy
saw
in
me
his
predestinated
opportunity
and
had
no
idea
of
letting
it
post
up
the
road
that
night
to
the
next
village
he
cleared
his
throat
respectfully
and
cut
into
the
conversation
ah
thinkin
the
gentleman
micht
find
a
coomfortaible
lodgin
wi
the
weedow
macphairson
a
wee
bittie
doon
the
road
her
dochter
is
awa
in
ameriky
an
the
room
is
a
verra
fine
room
an
it
is
a
peety
to
hae
it
stannin
idle
an
ye
wudna
mind
the
few
steps
to
and
fro
tae
yir
meals
here
sir
wud
ye
an
if
ye
gang
wi
me
efter
dinner
be
prood
to
shoo
ye
the
hoose
so
after
a
good
dinner
with
the
english
fishermen
sandy
piloted
me
down
the
road
through
the
thickening
dusk
i
remember
a
hoodie
crow
flew
close
behind
us
with
a
choking
ghostly
cough
that
startled
me
the
macpherson
cottage
was
a
snug
little
house
of
stone
with
fuchsias
and
roses
growing
in
the
front
yard
and
the
widow
was
a
douce
old
lady
with
a
face
like
a
winter
apple
in
the
month
of
april
wrinkled
but
still
rosy
she
was
a
little
doubtful
about
entertaining
strangers
but
when
she
heard
i
was
from
america
she
opened
the
doors
of
her
house
and
her
heart
and
when
by
a
subtle
cross
examination
that
would
have
been
a
credit
to
the
wife
of
a
connecticut
deacon
she
discovered
the
fact
that
her
lodger
was
a
minister
she
did
two
things
with
equal
and
immediate
fervour
she
brought
out
the
big
bible
and
asked
him
to
conduct
evening
worship
and
she
produced
a
bottle
of
old
glenlivet
and
begged
him
to
guard
against
takkin
cauld
by
takkin
a
glass
of
speerits
it
was
a
very
pleasant
fortnight
at
melvich
mistress
macpherson
was
so
motherly
that
takkin
cauld
was
reduced
to
a
permanent
impossibility
the
other
men
at
the
inn
proved
to
be
very
companionable
fellows
quite
different
from
the
monsters
of
insolence
that
my
anger
had
imagined
in
the
moment
of
disappointment
the
shooting
party
kept
the
table
abundantly
supplied
with
grouse
and
hares
and
highland
venison
and
there
was
a
piper
to
march
up
and
down
before
the
window
and
play
while
we
ate
dinner
a
very
complimentary
and
disquieting
performance
but
there
are
many
occasions
in
life
when
pride
can
be
entertained
only
at
the
expense
of
comfort
of
course
sandy
was
my
gillie
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
him
exhibiting
the
tiny
american
tied
with
silk
ribbons
in
its
delicate
case
to
the
other
gillies
and
exulting
over
them
every
morning
he
would
lead
me
away
through
the
heather
to
some
lonely
loch
on
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
from
which
we
could
look
down
upon
the
northern
sea
and
the
blue
orkney
isles
far
away
across
the
pentland
firth
sometimes
we
would
find
a
loch
with
a
boat
on
it
and
drift
up
and
down
casting
along
the
shores
sometimes
in
spite
of
sandy
confident
predictions
no
boat
could
be
found
and
then
i
must
put
on
the
mackintosh
trousers
and
wade
out
over
my
hips
into
the
water
and
circumambulate
the
pond
throwing
the
flies
as
far
as
possible
toward
the
middle
and
feeling
my
way
carefully
along
the
bottom
with
the
long
while
sandy
danced
on
the
bank
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
his
predestinated
opportunity
should
step
into
a
deep
hole
and
be
drowned
it
was
a
curious
fact
in
natural
history
that
on
the
lochs
with
boats
the
trout
were
in
the
shallow
water
but
in
the
boatless
lochs
they
were
away
out
in
the
depths
juist
the
total
depraivity
troots
said
sandy
an
terrible
fateegin
sandy
had
an
aversion
to
commit
himself
to
definite
statements
on
any
subject
not
theological
if
you
asked
him
how
long
the
morning
tramp
would
be
it
was
no
verra
long
juist
a
bit
ayant
the
hull
yonner
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
mile
you
complained
that
it
was
much
too
far
he
would
never
do
more
than
admit
that
it
micht
be
shorter
if
you
called
him
to
rejoice
over
a
trout
that
weighed
close
upon
two
pounds
he
allowed
that
it
was
no
bad
but
there
bigger
anes
i
the
loch
gin
we
cud
but
wile
them
oot
and
at
when
we
turned
out
a
full
basket
of
shining
fish
on
the
heather
the
most
that
he
would
say
while
his
eyes
snapped
with
joy
and
pride
was
aweel
we
canna
complain
the
day
then
he
would
gather
an
armful
of
dried
for
kindling
and
dig
out
a
few
roots
and
crooked
limbs
of
the
forest
from
the
dry
brown
peaty
soil
and
make
our
campfire
of
prehistoric
wood
just
for
the
pleasant
homelike
look
of
the
blaze
and
sit
down
beside
it
to
eat
our
lunch
heat
is
the
least
of
the
benefits
that
man
gets
from
fire
it
is
the
sign
of
cheerfulness
and
good
comradeship
i
would
not
willingly
satisfy
my
hunger
even
in
a
summer
nooning
without
a
little
flame
burning
on
a
rustic
altar
to
consecrate
and
enliven
the
feast
when
the
bread
and
cheese
were
finished
and
the
pipes
were
filled
with
virginia
tobacco
sandy
would
begin
to
tell
me
very
solemnly
and
respectfully
about
the
mistakes
i
had
made
in
the
fishing
that
day
and
mourn
over
the
fact
that
the
largest
fish
had
not
been
hooked
there
was
a
strong
strain
of
pessimism
in
sandy
and
he
enjoyed
this
part
of
the
sport
immensely
but
he
was
at
his
best
in
the
walk
home
through
the
lingering
twilight
when
the
murmur
of
the
sea
trembled
through
the
air
and
the
incense
of
burning
peat
floated
up
from
the
cottages
and
the
stars
blossomed
one
by
one
in
the
sky
then
sandy
dandered
on
at
his
ease
down
the
hills
and
discoursed
of
things
in
heaven
and
earth
he
was
an
unconscious
follower
of
the
theology
of
the
reverend
john
jasper
of
richmond
virginia
and
rejected
the
copernican
theory
of
the
universe
as
inconsistent
with
the
history
of
joshua
gin
the
sun
doesna
muve
said
he
what
for
wad
joshua
be
tellin
him
to
stond
steel
wad
suner
beleeve
there
was
a
mistak
in
the
veesible
heevens
than
ae
fault
in
the
guid
buik
whereupon
we
held
long
discourse
of
astronomy
and
inspiration
but
sandy
concluded
it
with
a
philosophic
word
which
left
little
to
be
said
aweel
yon
teelescope
is
a
wonnerful
deescovery
but
dinna
think
the
less
o
the
baible
iii
white
heather
memory
is
a
capricious
and
arbitrary
creature
you
never
can
tell
what
pebble
she
will
pick
up
from
the
shore
of
life
to
keep
among
her
treasures
or
what
inconspicuous
flower
of
the
field
she
will
preserve
as
the
symbol
of
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
she
has
her
own
scale
of
values
for
these
mementos
and
knows
nothing
of
the
market
price
of
precious
stones
or
the
costly
splendour
of
rare
orchids
the
thing
that
pleases
her
is
the
thing
that
she
will
hold
fast
and
yet
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
most
important
things
are
always
the
best
remembered
only
we
must
learn
that
the
real
importance
of
what
we
see
and
hear
in
the
world
is
to
be
measured
at
last
by
its
meaning
its
significance
its
intimacy
with
the
heart
of
our
heart
and
the
life
of
our
life
and
when
we
find
a
little
token
of
the
past
very
safely
and
imperishably
kept
among
our
recollections
we
must
believe
that
memory
has
made
no
mistake
it
is
because
that
little
thing
has
entered
into
our
experience
most
deeply
that
it
stays
with
us
and
we
can
not
lose
it
you
have
half
forgotten
many
a
famous
scene
that
you
travelled
far
to
look
upon
you
can
not
clearly
recall
the
sublime
peak
of
mont
blanc
the
roaring
curve
of
niagara
the
vast
dome
of
peter
the
music
of
patti
crystalline
voice
has
left
no
distinct
echo
in
your
remembrance
and
the
blossoming
of
the
is
dimmer
than
the
shadow
of
a
dream
but
there
is
a
nameless
valley
among
the
hills
where
you
can
still
trace
every
curve
of
the
stream
and
see
the
floating
on
the
pool
below
the
bridge
and
the
long
moss
wavering
in
the
current
there
is
a
rustic
song
of
a
girl
passing
through
the
fields
at
sunset
that
still
repeats
its
cadence
in
your
listening
ears
there
is
a
small
flower
trembling
on
its
stem
in
some
hidden
nook
beneath
the
open
sky
that
never
withers
through
all
the
changing
years
the
wind
passes
over
it
but
it
is
not
gone
it
abides
forever
in
your
soul
an
amaranthine
blossom
of
beauty
and
truth
white
heather
is
not
an
easy
flower
to
find
you
may
look
for
it
among
the
highlands
for
a
day
without
success
and
when
it
is
discovered
there
is
little
outward
charm
to
commend
it
it
lacks
the
grace
of
the
dainty
bells
that
hang
so
abundantly
from
the
erica
tetralix
and
the
pink
glow
of
the
innumerable
blossoms
of
the
common
heather
but
then
it
is
a
symbol
it
is
the
scotch
edelweiss
it
means
sincere
affection
and
unselfish
love
and
tender
wishes
as
pure
as
prayers
i
shall
always
remember
the
evening
when
i
found
the
white
heather
on
the
moorland
above
glen
ericht
or
rather
it
was
not
i
that
found
it
for
i
have
little
luck
in
the
discovery
of
good
omens
and
have
never
plucked
a
clover
in
my
life
but
my
companion
the
gentle
mistress
of
the
glen
whose
hair
was
as
white
as
the
tiny
blossoms
and
yet
whose
eyes
were
far
quicker
than
mine
to
see
and
name
every
flower
that
bloomed
in
those
lofty
widespread
fields
ericht
water
is
formed
by
the
marriage
of
two
streams
one
flowing
out
of
strath
ardle
and
the
other
descending
from
cairn
gowar
through
the
long
lonely
pass
of
glenshee
the
ericht
begins
at
the
bridge
of
cally
and
its
placid
beautiful
glen
unmarred
by
railway
or
factory
reaches
almost
down
to
blairgowrie
on
the
southern
bank
but
far
above
the
water
runs
the
high
road
to
braemar
and
the
linn
of
dee
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
nestling
among
the
trees
is
the
low
white
an
ancient
home
of
peace
it
is
a
place
where
one
who
had
been
wearied
and
perchance
sore
wounded
in
the
battle
of
life
might
well
desire
to
be
carried
as
arthur
to
the
island
valley
of
avilion
for
rest
and
healing
i
have
no
thought
of
renewing
the
conflicts
and
cares
that
filled
that
summer
with
sorrow
there
were
fightings
without
and
fears
within
there
was
the
surrender
of
an
enterprise
that
had
been
cherished
since
boyhood
and
the
bitter
sense
of
irremediable
weakness
that
follows
such
a
reverse
there
was
a
touch
of
that
wrath
with
those
we
love
which
as
coleridge
says
doth
work
like
madness
in
the
brain
flying
across
the
sea
from
these
troubles
i
had
found
my
old
comrade
of
merrier
days
sentenced
to
death
and
caught
but
a
brief
glimpse
of
his
pale
brave
face
as
he
went
away
into
exile
at
such
a
time
the
sun
and
the
light
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
darkened
and
the
clouds
return
after
rain
but
through
those
clouds
the
mistress
of
the
glen
came
to
meet
me
a
stranger
till
then
but
an
appointed
friend
a
minister
of
needed
grace
an
angel
of
quiet
comfort
the
thick
mists
of
rebellion
mistrust
and
despair
have
long
since
rolled
away
and
against
the
background
of
the
hills
her
figure
stands
out
clearly
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
fifty
years
ago
with
the
snowy
hair
gathered
close
beneath
her
widow
cap
and
a
spray
of
white
heather
in
her
outstretched
hand
there
were
no
other
guests
in
the
house
by
the
river
during
those
still
days
in
the
noontide
hush
of
midsummer
every
morning
while
the
mistress
was
busied
with
her
household
cares
and
letters
i
would
be
out
in
the
fields
hearing
the
lark
sing
and
watching
the
rabbits
as
they
ran
to
and
fro
scattering
the
dew
from
the
grass
in
a
glittering
spray
or
perhaps
i
would
be
angling
down
the
river
with
the
swift
pressure
of
the
water
around
my
knees
and
an
inarticulate
current
of
cooling
thoughts
flowing
on
and
on
through
my
brain
like
the
murmur
of
the
stream
every
afternoon
there
were
long
walks
with
the
mistress
in
the
garden
where
wonderful
roses
were
blooming
or
through
the
dark
den
where
the
wild
burn
dropped
down
to
join
the
river
or
out
upon
the
high
moor
under
the
waning
orange
sunset
every
night
there
were
luminous
and
restful
talks
beside
the
open
fire
in
the
library
when
the
words
came
clear
and
calm
from
the
heart
unperturbed
by
the
vain
desire
of
saying
brilliant
things
which
turns
so
much
of
our
conversation
into
a
combat
of
wits
instead
of
an
interchange
of
thoughts
talk
like
this
is
possible
only
between
two
the
arrival
of
a
third
person
sets
the
lists
for
a
tournament
and
offers
the
prize
for
a
verbal
victory
but
where
there
are
only
two
the
armour
is
laid
aside
and
there
is
no
call
to
thrust
and
parry
one
of
the
two
should
be
a
good
listener
sympathetic
but
not
silent
giving
confidence
in
order
to
attract
it
and
of
this
art
a
woman
is
the
best
master
but
its
finest
secrets
do
not
come
to
her
until
she
has
passed
beyond
the
uncertain
season
of
compliments
and
conquests
and
entered
into
the
serenity
of
a
tranquil
age
what
is
this
foolish
thing
that
men
say
about
the
impossibility
of
true
intimacy
and
converse
between
the
young
and
the
old
hamerton
for
example
in
his
book
on
human
intercourse
would
have
us
believe
that
a
difference
in
years
is
a
barrier
between
hearts
for
my
part
i
have
more
often
found
it
an
open
door
and
a
security
of
generous
and
tolerant
welcome
for
the
young
soldier
who
comes
in
tired
and
dusty
from
the
to
tell
his
story
of
defeat
or
victory
in
the
garden
of
still
thoughts
where
old
age
is
resting
in
the
peace
of
honourable
discharge
i
like
what
robert
louis
stevenson
says
about
it
in
his
essay
on
talk
and
talkers
not
only
is
the
presence
of
the
aged
in
itself
remedial
but
their
minds
are
stored
with
antidotes
wisdom
simples
plain
considerations
overlooked
by
youth
they
have
matter
to
communicate
be
they
never
so
stupid
their
talk
is
not
merely
literature
it
is
great
literature
classic
by
virtue
of
the
speaker
detachment
studded
like
a
book
of
travel
with
things
we
should
not
otherwise
have
learnt
where
youth
agrees
with
age
not
where
they
differ
wisdom
lies
and
it
is
when
the
young
disciple
finds
his
heart
to
beat
in
tune
with
his
teacher
that
a
lesson
may
be
learned
the
conversation
of
the
mistress
of
the
glen
shone
like
the
light
and
distilled
like
the
dew
not
only
by
virtue
of
what
she
said
but
still
more
by
virtue
of
what
she
was
her
face
was
a
good
counsel
against
discouragement
and
the
cheerful
quietude
of
her
demeanour
was
a
rebuke
to
all
rebellious
cowardly
and
discontented
thoughts
it
was
not
the
striking
novelty
or
profundity
of
her
commentary
on
life
that
made
it
memorable
it
was
simply
the
truth
of
what
she
said
and
the
gentleness
with
which
she
said
it
epigrams
are
worth
little
for
guidance
to
the
perplexed
and
less
for
comfort
to
the
wounded
but
the
plain
homely
sayings
which
come
from
a
soul
that
has
learned
the
lesson
of
patient
courage
in
the
school
of
real
experience
fall
upon
the
wound
like
drops
of
balsam
and
like
a
soothing
lotion
up
on
the
eyes
smarting
and
blinded
with
passion
she
spoke
of
those
who
had
walked
with
her
long
ago
in
her
garden
and
for
whose
sake
now
that
they
had
all
gone
into
the
world
of
light
every
flower
was
doubly
dear
would
it
be
a
true
proof
of
loyalty
to
them
if
she
lived
gloomily
or
despondently
because
they
were
away
she
spoke
of
the
duty
of
being
ready
to
welcome
happiness
as
well
as
to
endure
pain
and
of
the
strength
that
endurance
wins
by
being
grateful
for
small
daily
joys
like
the
evening
light
and
the
smell
of
roses
and
the
singing
of
birds
she
spoke
of
the
faith
that
rests
on
the
unseen
wisdom
and
love
like
a
child
on
its
mother
breast
and
of
the
melting
away
of
doubts
in
the
warmth
of
an
effort
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
and
if
that
effort
has
conflict
and
adventure
and
confused
noise
and
mistakes
and
even
defeats
mingled
with
it
in
the
stormy
years
of
youth
is
not
that
to
be
expected
the
burn
roars
and
leaps
in
the
den
the
stream
chafes
and
frets
through
the
rapids
of
the
glen
the
river
does
not
grow
calm
and
smooth
until
it
nears
the
sea
courage
is
a
virtue
that
the
young
can
not
spare
to
lose
it
is
to
grow
old
before
the
time
it
is
better
to
make
a
thousand
mistakes
and
suffer
a
thousand
reverses
than
to
refuse
the
battle
resignation
is
the
final
courage
of
old
age
it
arrives
in
its
own
season
and
it
is
a
good
day
when
it
comes
to
us
then
there
are
no
more
disappointments
for
we
have
learned
that
it
is
even
better
to
desire
the
things
that
we
have
than
to
have
the
things
that
we
desire
and
is
not
the
best
of
all
our
hopes
the
hope
of
immortality
always
before
us
how
can
we
be
dull
or
heavy
while
we
have
that
new
experience
to
look
forward
to
it
will
be
the
most
joyful
of
all
our
travels
and
adventures
it
will
bring
us
our
best
acquaintances
and
friendships
but
there
is
only
one
way
to
get
ready
for
immortality
and
that
is
to
love
this
life
and
live
it
as
bravely
and
cheerfully
and
faithfully
as
we
can
so
my
gentle
teacher
with
the
silver
hair
showed
me
the
treasures
of
her
ancient
simple
faith
and
i
felt
that
no
sermons
nor
books
nor
arguments
can
strengthen
the
doubting
heart
so
deeply
as
just
to
come
into
touch
with
a
soul
which
has
proved
the
truth
of
that
plain
religion
whose
highest
philosophy
is
trust
in
the
lord
and
do
good
at
the
end
of
the
evening
the
household
was
gathered
for
prayers
and
the
mistress
kneeled
among
her
servants
leading
them
in
her
soft
scottish
accent
through
the
old
familiar
petitions
for
pardon
for
the
errors
of
the
day
and
refreshing
sleep
through
the
night
and
strength
for
the
morrow
it
is
good
to
be
in
a
land
where
the
people
are
not
ashamed
to
pray
i
have
shared
the
blessing
of
catholics
at
their
table
in
lowly
huts
among
the
mountains
of
the
tyrol
and
knelt
with
covenanters
at
their
household
altar
in
the
glens
of
scotland
and
all
around
the
world
where
the
spirit
of
prayer
is
there
is
peace
the
genius
of
the
scotch
has
made
many
contributions
to
literature
but
none
i
think
more
precious
and
none
that
comes
closer
to
the
heart
than
the
prayer
which
robert
louis
stevenson
wrote
for
his
family
in
distant
samoa
the
night
before
he
died
we
beseech
thee
lord
to
behold
us
with
favour
folk
of
many
families
and
nations
gathered
together
in
the
peace
of
this
roof
weak
men
and
women
subsisting
under
the
covert
of
thy
patience
be
patient
still
suffer
us
yet
a
while
longer
with
our
broken
promises
of
good
with
our
idle
endeavours
against
evil
suffer
us
a
while
longer
to
endure
and
if
it
may
be
help
us
to
do
better
bless
to
us
our
extraordinary
mercies
if
the
day
come
when
these
must
be
taken
have
us
play
the
man
under
affliction
be
with
our
friends
be
with
ourselves
go
with
each
of
us
to
rest
if
any
awake
temper
to
them
the
dark
hours
of
watching
and
when
the
day
returns
to
us
our
sun
and
comforter
call
us
with
morning
faces
eager
to
labour
eager
to
be
happy
if
happiness
shall
be
our
portion
and
if
the
day
be
marked
to
sorrow
strong
to
endure
it
we
thank
thee
and
praise
thee
and
in
the
words
of
him
to
whom
this
day
is
sacred
close
our
oblation
the
man
who
made
that
kindly
human
prayer
knew
the
meaning
of
white
heather
and
i
dare
to
hope
that
i
too
have
known
something
of
its
meaning
since
that
evening
when
the
mistress
of
the
glen
picked
the
spray
and
gave
it
to
me
on
the
lonely
moor
and
now
she
said
you
will
be
going
home
across
the
sea
and
you
have
been
welcome
here
but
it
is
time
that
you
should
go
for
there
is
the
place
where
your
real
duties
and
troubles
and
joys
are
waiting
for
you
and
if
you
have
left
any
misunderstandings
behind
you
you
will
try
to
clear
them
up
and
if
there
have
been
any
quarrels
you
will
heal
them
carry
this
little
flower
with
you
it
not
the
bonniest
blossom
in
scotland
but
it
the
dearest
for
the
message
that
it
brings
and
you
will
remember
that
love
is
not
getting
but
giving
not
a
wild
dream
of
pleasure
and
a
madness
of
desire
oh
no
love
is
not
that
it
is
goodness
and
honour
and
peace
and
pure
living
yes
love
is
that
and
it
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
the
thing
that
lives
longest
and
that
is
what
i
am
wishing
for
you
and
yours
with
this
bit
of
white
heather
the
ristigouche
from
a
paley
was
ardently
attached
to
this
amusement
so
much
so
that
when
the
bishop
of
durham
inquired
of
him
when
one
of
his
most
important
works
would
be
finished
he
said
with
great
simplicity
and
good
humour
lord
i
shall
work
steadily
at
it
when
the
season
is
over
sir
humphry
davy
salmonia
the
boundary
line
between
the
province
of
quebec
and
new
brunswick
for
a
considerable
part
of
its
course
resembles
the
name
of
the
poet
keats
it
is
writ
in
water
but
like
his
fame
it
is
water
that
never
fails
the
limpid
current
of
the
river
ristigouche
the
railway
crawls
over
it
on
a
long
bridge
at
metapedia
and
you
are
dropped
in
the
darkness
somewhere
between
midnight
and
dawn
when
you
open
your
the
next
morning
you
see
that
the
village
is
a
disconsolate
hamlet
scattered
along
the
track
as
if
it
had
been
shaken
by
chance
from
an
open
it
consists
of
twenty
houses
three
shops
and
a
discouraged
church
perched
upon
a
little
hillock
like
a
solitary
mourner
on
the
anxious
seat
the
one
comfortable
and
prosperous
feature
in
the
countenance
of
metapedia
is
the
house
of
the
ristigouche
salmon
club
an
mansion
with
broad
white
piazza
looking
over
rich
here
it
was
that
i
found
my
friend
favonius
president
of
solemn
societies
pillar
of
church
and
state
ingenuously
arrayed
in
gray
knickerbockers
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
soft
hat
waiting
to
take
me
on
his
for
a
voyage
up
the
river
have
you
ever
seen
a
sometimes
it
is
called
a
scow
but
that
sounds
common
sometimes
it
is
called
a
but
that
is
too
english
what
does
it
profit
a
man
to
have
a
whole
dictionary
full
of
language
at
his
service
unless
he
can
invent
a
new
and
suggestive
name
for
his
friend
the
foundation
of
the
if
a
thing
that
floats
may
be
called
fundamental
is
a
boat
some
fifty
feet
long
and
ten
feet
wide
with
a
draft
of
about
eight
inches
the
deck
is
open
for
fifteen
feet
aft
of
the
place
where
the
bowsprit
ought
to
be
behind
that
it
is
completely
covered
by
a
house
cabin
cottage
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
with
straight
sides
and
a
peaked
roof
of
a
very
early
gothic
pattern
looking
in
at
the
door
you
see
first
of
all
two
cots
one
on
either
side
of
the
passage
then
an
open
space
with
a
a
stove
and
some
chairs
beyond
that
a
pantry
with
shelves
and
a
great
chest
for
provisions
a
door
at
the
back
opens
into
the
kitchen
and
from
that
another
door
opens
into
a
for
the
boatmen
a
huge
wooden
tiller
curves
over
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
the
helmsman
stands
upon
the
two
canoes
are
floating
behind
holding
back
at
the
end
of
their
long
as
if
reluctant
to
follow
so
clumsy
a
leader
this
is
an
accurate
description
of
the
if
necessary
it
could
be
sworn
to
before
a
notary
public
but
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
you
might
read
this
page
through
without
skipping
a
word
and
if
you
had
never
seen
the
creature
with
your
own
eyes
you
would
have
no
idea
how
absurd
it
looks
and
how
comfortable
it
is
while
we
were
stowing
away
our
trunks
and
bags
under
the
cots
and
making
an
equitable
division
of
the
hooks
upon
the
walls
the
motive
power
of
the
yacht
stood
patiently
upon
the
shore
stamping
a
hoof
now
and
then
or
shaking
a
shaggy
head
in
mild
protest
against
the
flies
three
more
horses
i
never
saw
they
were
harnessed
abreast
and
fastened
by
a
prodigious
to
a
short
post
in
the
middle
of
the
forward
deck
their
driver
was
a
truculent
brigandish
bearded
old
fellow
in
long
boots
a
blue
flannel
shirt
and
a
black
sombrero
he
sat
upon
the
middle
horse
and
some
wild
instinct
of
colour
had
made
him
tie
a
big
red
handkerchief
around
his
shoulders
so
that
the
eye
of
the
beholder
took
delight
in
him
he
posed
like
a
bold
bad
but
in
point
of
fact
i
believe
he
was
the
mildest
and
most
inoffensive
of
men
we
never
heard
him
say
anything
except
at
a
distance
to
his
horses
and
we
did
not
inquire
what
that
was
well
as
i
have
said
we
were
haggling
courteously
over
those
hooks
in
the
cabin
when
the
boat
gave
a
lurch
the
bow
swung
out
into
the
stream
there
was
a
scrambling
and
clattering
of
iron
on
the
rough
shingle
of
the
bank
and
when
we
looked
out
of
doors
our
house
was
moving
up
the
river
with
the
boat
under
it
the
ristigouche
is
a
noble
stream
stately
and
swift
and
strong
it
rises
among
the
dense
forests
in
the
northern
part
of
new
brunswick
a
moist
upland
region
of
springs
and
innumerous
lakes
and
pours
a
flood
of
clear
cold
water
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
northward
and
eastward
through
the
hills
into
the
head
of
the
bay
of
chaleurs
there
are
no
falls
in
its
course
but
rapids
everywhere
it
is
steadfast
but
not
impetuous
quick
but
not
turbulent
resolute
and
eager
in
its
desire
to
get
to
the
sea
like
the
life
of
a
man
who
has
a
purpose
too
great
for
haste
too
high
for
rivalry
the
wonder
is
where
all
the
water
comes
from
but
the
river
is
fed
by
more
than
six
thousand
square
miles
of
territory
from
both
sides
the
little
brooks
come
dashing
in
with
their
supply
at
intervals
a
larger
stream
reaching
away
back
among
the
mountains
like
a
hand
with
many
fingers
to
gather
the
filtered
tribute
of
the
rough
woodland
delivers
its
generous
offering
to
the
main
current
the
names
of
the
chief
tributaries
of
the
ristigouche
are
curious
there
is
the
headstrong
metapedia
and
the
crooked
upsalquitch
and
the
patapedia
and
the
quatawamkedgwick
these
are
words
at
which
the
tongue
balks
at
first
but
you
soon
grow
used
to
them
and
learn
to
take
anything
of
five
syllables
with
a
rush
as
a
hunter
takes
a
gate
trusting
to
fortune
that
you
will
come
down
with
the
accent
in
the
right
place
for
six
or
seven
miles
above
metapedia
the
river
has
a
breadth
of
about
two
hundred
yards
and
the
valley
slopes
back
rather
gently
to
the
mountains
on
either
side
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cultivated
land
and
scattered
appear
the
soil
is
excellent
but
it
is
like
a
pearl
cast
before
an
obstinate
unfriendly
climate
late
frosts
prolong
the
winter
early
frosts
curtail
the
summer
the
only
safe
crops
are
grass
oats
and
potatoes
and
for
half
the
year
all
the
cattle
must
be
housed
and
fed
to
keep
them
alive
this
lends
a
melancholy
aspect
to
agriculture
most
of
the
farmers
look
as
if
they
had
never
seen
better
days
with
few
exceptions
they
are
what
a
new
englander
would
call
and
shiftless
their
barns
are
pervious
to
the
weather
and
their
fences
fail
to
connect
sleds
and
ploughs
rust
together
beside
the
house
and
chickens
scratch
up
the
yard
in
truth
the
people
have
been
somewhat
demoralised
by
the
conflicting
claims
of
different
occupations
hunting
in
the
fall
lumbering
in
the
winter
and
spring
and
working
for
the
american
sportsmen
in
the
brief
angling
season
are
so
much
more
attractive
and
offer
so
much
larger
returns
of
ready
money
that
the
tedious
toil
of
farming
is
neglected
but
for
all
that
in
the
bright
days
of
midsummer
these
green
fields
sloping
down
to
the
water
and
pastures
high
up
among
the
trees
on
the
hillsides
look
pleasant
from
a
distance
and
give
an
inhabited
air
to
the
landscape
at
the
mouth
of
the
upsalquitch
we
passed
the
first
of
the
it
belongs
to
a
sage
angler
from
albany
who
saw
the
beauty
of
the
situation
years
ago
and
built
a
habitation
to
match
it
since
that
time
a
number
of
gentlemen
have
bought
land
fronting
on
good
pools
and
put
up
little
cottages
of
a
less
classical
style
than
charles
cotton
fisherman
retreat
on
the
banks
of
the
river
dove
but
better
suited
to
this
wild
scenery
and
more
convenient
to
live
in
the
prevailing
pattern
is
a
very
simple
one
it
consists
of
a
broad
piazza
with
a
small
house
in
the
middle
of
it
the
house
bears
about
the
same
proportion
to
the
piazza
that
the
crown
of
a
gainsborough
hat
does
to
the
brim
and
the
cost
of
the
edifice
is
to
the
cost
of
the
land
as
the
first
price
of
a
share
in
a
bankrupt
railway
is
to
the
assessments
which
follow
the
reorganisation
all
the
best
points
have
been
sold
and
real
estate
on
the
ristigouche
has
been
bid
up
to
an
absurd
figure
in
fact
the
river
is
and
probably
but
we
could
hardly
find
it
in
our
hearts
to
regret
this
for
it
made
the
upward
trip
a
very
sociable
one
at
every
lodge
that
was
open
favonius
who
knows
everybody
had
a
friend
and
we
must
slip
ashore
in
a
canoe
to
leave
the
mail
and
refresh
the
inner
man
an
angler
like
an
arab
regards
hospitality
as
a
religious
duty
there
seems
to
be
something
in
the
craft
which
inclines
the
heart
to
kindness
and
few
anglers
have
i
seen
who
were
not
pleasant
to
meet
and
ready
to
do
a
good
turn
to
a
with
the
gift
of
a
killing
fly
or
the
loan
of
a
rod
not
their
own
particular
and
favourite
of
course
for
that
is
a
treasure
which
no
decent
man
would
borrow
but
with
that
exception
the
best
in
their
store
is
at
the
service
of
an
accredited
brother
one
of
the
ristigouche
proprietors
i
remember
whose
name
bespoke
him
a
descendant
of
caledonia
patron
saint
he
was
fishing
in
front
of
his
own
door
when
we
came
up
with
our
splashing
horses
through
the
pool
but
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
up
anchor
and
have
us
away
with
him
into
the
house
to
taste
his
good
cheer
and
there
were
his
daughters
with
their
books
and
needlework
and
the
photographs
which
they
had
taken
pinned
up
on
the
wooden
walls
among
japanese
fans
and
bits
of
stuff
in
which
the
soul
of
woman
delights
and
in
a
passive
silent
way
the
soul
of
man
also
then
after
we
had
discussed
the
year
fishing
and
the
mysteries
of
the
camera
and
the
deep
question
of
what
makes
some
negatives
too
thin
and
others
too
thick
we
must
go
out
to
see
the
big
salmon
which
one
of
the
ladies
had
caught
a
few
days
before
and
the
large
trout
swimming
about
in
their
cold
spring
it
seemed
to
me
as
we
went
on
our
way
that
there
could
hardly
be
a
more
wholesome
and
pleasant
for
young
women
than
this
or
two
amusements
more
innocent
and
sensible
than
photography
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
as
a
vehicle
of
travel
is
not
remarkable
in
point
of
speed
three
miles
an
hour
is
not
a
very
rapid
rate
of
motion
but
then
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
why
should
you
care
to
make
haste
the
wild
desire
to
be
forever
racing
against
old
father
time
is
one
of
the
of
modern
life
that
ancient
traveller
is
sure
to
beat
you
in
the
long
run
and
as
long
as
you
are
trying
to
rival
him
he
will
make
your
life
a
burden
but
if
you
will
only
acknowledge
his
superiority
and
profess
that
you
do
not
approve
of
racing
after
all
he
will
settle
down
quietly
beside
you
and
jog
along
like
the
most
companionable
of
creatures
that
is
a
pleasant
pilgrimage
in
which
the
journey
itself
is
part
of
the
destination
as
soon
as
one
learns
to
regard
the
as
a
sort
of
moving
house
it
appears
admirable
there
is
no
dust
or
smoke
no
rumble
of
wheels
or
shriek
of
whistles
you
are
gliding
along
steadily
through
an
world
skirting
the
silent
hills
passing
from
one
side
of
the
river
to
the
other
when
the
horses
have
to
swim
the
current
to
find
a
good
foothold
on
the
bank
you
are
on
the
water
but
not
at
its
mercy
for
your
craft
is
not
disturbed
by
the
heaving
of
rude
waves
and
the
serene
inhabitants
do
not
say
i
am
sick
there
is
room
enough
to
move
about
without
falling
overboard
you
may
sleep
or
read
or
write
in
your
cabin
or
sit
upon
the
floating
piazza
in
an
and
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
while
the
cool
breeze
blows
in
your
face
and
the
musical
waves
go
singing
down
to
the
sea
there
was
one
feature
about
the
boat
which
commended
itself
very
strongly
to
my
mind
it
was
possible
to
stand
upon
the
forward
deck
and
do
a
little
in
motion
by
watching
your
chance
when
the
corner
of
a
good
pool
was
within
easy
reach
you
could
send
out
a
hasty
line
and
cajole
a
from
his
it
is
true
that
the
and
the
post
made
the
back
cast
a
little
awkward
and
the
wind
sometimes
blew
the
flies
up
on
the
roof
of
the
cabin
but
then
with
patience
and
a
short
line
the
thing
could
be
done
i
remember
a
pair
of
good
trout
that
rose
together
just
as
we
were
going
through
a
boiling
rapid
and
it
tried
the
strength
of
my
rod
to
bring
those
fish
to
the
net
against
the
current
and
the
motion
of
the
boat
when
nightfall
approached
we
let
go
the
anchor
to
wit
a
rope
tied
to
a
large
stone
on
the
shore
ate
our
dinner
with
gladness
and
singleness
of
heart
like
the
early
christians
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
lulled
by
the
murmuring
of
the
waters
and
defended
from
the
insidious
attacks
of
the
mosquito
by
the
breeze
blowing
down
the
river
and
the
impregnable
curtains
over
our
beds
at
daybreak
long
before
favonius
and
i
had
finished
our
dreams
we
were
under
way
again
and
when
the
trampling
of
the
horses
on
some
rocky
shore
wakened
us
we
could
see
the
steep
hills
gliding
past
the
windows
and
hear
the
rapids
dashing
against
the
side
of
the
boat
and
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
still
dreaming
at
cross
point
where
the
river
makes
a
long
loop
around
a
narrow
mountain
thin
as
a
saw
and
crowned
on
its
jagged
edge
by
a
rude
wooden
cross
we
stopped
for
an
hour
to
try
the
fishing
it
was
here
that
i
hooked
two
mysterious
creatures
each
of
which
took
the
fly
when
it
was
below
the
surface
pulled
for
a
few
moments
in
a
sullen
way
and
then
apparently
melted
into
nothingness
it
will
always
be
a
source
of
regret
to
me
that
the
nature
of
these
fish
must
remain
unknown
while
they
were
on
the
line
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
they
were
heavy
trout
but
no
sooner
had
they
departed
than
i
became
firmly
convinced
in
accordance
with
a
psychological
law
which
holds
good
all
over
the
world
that
they
were
both
enormous
salmon
even
the
turks
have
a
proverb
which
says
every
fish
that
escapes
appears
larger
than
it
is
no
one
can
alter
that
conviction
because
no
one
can
logically
refute
it
our
best
blessings
like
our
largest
fish
always
depart
before
we
have
time
to
measure
them
the
slide
pool
is
in
the
wildest
and
most
picturesque
part
of
the
river
about
miles
above
metapedia
the
stream
flowing
swiftly
down
a
stretch
of
rapids
between
hills
runs
straight
toward
the
base
of
an
eminence
so
precipitous
that
the
trees
can
hardly
find
a
foothold
upon
it
and
seem
to
be
climbing
up
in
haste
on
either
side
of
the
long
slide
which
leads
to
the
summit
the
current
barred
by
the
wall
of
rock
takes
a
great
sweep
to
the
right
dashing
up
at
first
in
angry
waves
then
falling
away
in
oily
curves
and
eddies
until
at
last
it
sleeps
in
a
black
deep
apparently
almost
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
it
was
here
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
stream
opposite
to
the
slide
that
we
brought
our
floating
camp
to
anchor
for
some
days
what
does
one
do
in
such
a
let
us
take
a
specimen
day
it
is
early
morning
or
to
be
more
precise
about
eight
of
the
clock
and
the
white
fog
is
just
beginning
to
curl
and
drift
away
from
the
surface
of
the
river
sooner
than
this
it
would
be
idle
to
go
out
the
preternaturally
early
bird
in
his
greedy
haste
may
catch
the
worm
but
the
salmon
never
take
the
fly
until
the
fog
has
lifted
and
in
this
the
scientific
angler
sees
with
gratitude
a
remarkable
adaptation
of
the
laws
of
nature
to
the
tastes
of
man
the
canoes
are
waiting
at
the
front
door
we
step
into
them
and
push
off
favonius
going
up
the
stream
a
couple
of
miles
to
the
mouth
of
the
patapedia
and
i
down
a
little
shorter
distance
to
the
famous
indian
house
pool
the
slim
boat
glides
easily
on
the
current
with
a
smooth
buoyant
motion
quickened
by
the
strokes
of
the
paddles
in
the
bow
and
the
stern
we
pass
around
two
curves
in
the
river
and
find
ourselves
at
the
head
of
the
pool
here
the
man
in
the
stern
drops
the
anchor
just
on
the
edge
of
the
bar
where
the
rapid
breaks
over
into
the
deeper
water
the
long
rod
is
lifted
the
fly
unhooked
from
the
reel
a
few
feet
of
line
pulled
through
the
rings
and
the
fishing
begins
first
cast
to
the
right
straight
across
the
stream
about
twenty
feet
the
current
carries
the
fly
down
with
a
semicircular
sweep
until
it
comes
in
line
with
the
bow
of
the
canoe
second
cast
to
the
left
straight
across
the
stream
with
the
same
motion
the
semicircle
is
completed
and
the
fly
hangs
quivering
for
a
few
seconds
at
the
lowest
point
of
the
arc
three
or
four
feet
of
line
are
drawn
from
the
reel
third
cast
to
the
right
fourth
cast
to
the
left
then
a
little
more
line
and
so
with
widening
the
water
is
covered
gradually
and
very
carefully
until
at
length
the
angler
has
as
much
line
out
as
his
rod
can
lift
and
swing
then
the
first
drop
is
finished
the
man
in
the
stern
quietly
pulls
up
the
anchor
and
lets
the
boat
drift
down
a
few
yards
the
same
process
is
repeated
on
the
second
drop
and
so
on
until
the
end
of
the
run
is
reached
and
the
fly
has
passed
over
all
the
good
water
this
seems
like
a
very
regular
and
somewhat
mechanical
proceeding
as
one
describes
it
but
in
the
performance
it
is
rendered
intensely
interesting
by
the
knowledge
that
at
any
moment
it
is
liable
to
be
interrupted
this
morning
the
interruption
comes
early
at
the
first
cast
of
the
second
drop
before
the
fly
has
fairly
lit
a
great
flash
of
silver
darts
from
the
waves
close
by
the
boat
usually
a
salmon
takes
the
fly
rather
slowly
carrying
it
under
water
before
he
seizes
it
in
his
mouth
but
this
one
is
in
no
mood
for
deliberation
he
has
hooked
himself
with
a
rush
and
the
line
goes
whirring
madly
from
the
reel
as
he
races
down
the
pool
keep
the
point
of
the
rod
low
he
must
have
his
own
way
now
up
with
the
anchor
quickly
and
send
the
canoe
after
him
bowman
and
sternman
paddling
with
swift
strokes
he
has
reached
the
deepest
water
he
stops
to
think
what
has
happened
to
him
we
have
passed
around
and
below
him
and
now
with
the
current
to
help
us
we
can
begin
to
reel
in
lift
the
point
of
the
rod
with
a
strong
steady
pull
put
the
force
of
both
arms
into
it
the
tough
wood
will
stand
the
strain
the
fish
must
be
moved
he
must
come
to
the
boat
if
he
is
ever
to
be
landed
he
gives
a
little
and
yields
slowly
to
the
pressure
then
suddenly
he
gives
too
much
and
runs
straight
toward
us
reel
in
now
as
swiftly
as
possible
or
else
he
will
get
a
slack
on
the
line
and
escape
now
he
stops
shakes
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
darts
away
again
across
the
pool
leaping
high
out
of
water
do
touch
the
reel
drop
the
point
of
the
rod
quickly
for
if
he
falls
on
the
leader
he
will
surely
break
it
another
leap
and
another
truly
he
is
a
merry
one
and
it
will
go
hard
with
us
to
hold
him
but
those
great
leaps
have
exhausted
his
strength
and
now
he
follows
the
rod
more
easily
the
men
push
the
boat
back
to
the
shallow
side
of
the
pool
until
it
touches
lightly
on
the
shore
the
fish
comes
slowly
in
fighting
a
little
and
making
a
few
short
runs
he
is
tired
and
turns
slightly
on
his
side
but
even
yet
he
is
a
heavy
weight
on
the
line
and
it
seems
a
wonder
that
so
slight
a
thing
as
the
leader
can
guide
and
draw
him
now
he
is
close
to
the
boat
the
boatman
steps
out
on
a
rock
with
his
gaff
steadily
now
and
slowly
lift
the
rod
bending
it
backward
a
quick
sure
stroke
of
the
steel
a
great
splash
and
the
salmon
is
lifted
upon
the
shore
how
he
flounces
about
on
the
stones
give
him
the
coup
de
grace
at
once
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
for
ours
and
now
look
at
him
as
he
lies
there
on
the
green
leaves
broad
back
small
head
tapering
to
a
point
clean
shining
sides
with
a
few
black
spots
on
them
it
is
a
fish
from
the
sea
in
perfect
condition
and
that
is
the
reason
why
he
has
given
such
good
sport
we
must
try
for
another
before
we
go
back
again
fortune
favours
us
and
at
eleven
we
pole
up
the
river
to
the
camp
with
two
good
salmon
in
the
canoe
hardly
have
we
laid
them
away
in
the
when
favonius
comes
dropping
down
from
patapedia
with
three
fish
one
of
them
a
pounder
and
so
the
morning
work
is
done
in
the
evening
after
dinner
it
was
our
custom
to
sit
out
on
the
deck
watching
the
moonlight
as
it
fell
softly
over
the
black
hills
and
changed
the
river
into
a
pale
flood
of
rolling
gold
the
fragrant
wreaths
of
smoke
floated
lazily
away
on
the
faint
breeze
of
night
there
was
no
sound
save
the
rushing
of
the
water
and
the
crackling
of
the
on
the
shore
we
talked
of
many
things
in
the
heavens
above
and
the
earth
beneath
and
the
waters
under
the
earth
touching
lightly
here
and
there
as
the
spirit
of
vagrant
converse
led
us
favonius
has
the
good
sense
to
talk
about
himself
occasionally
and
tell
his
own
experience
the
man
who
will
not
do
that
must
always
be
a
dull
companion
modest
egoism
is
the
salt
of
conversation
you
do
not
want
too
much
of
it
but
if
it
is
altogether
omitted
everything
tastes
flat
i
remember
well
the
evening
when
he
told
me
the
story
of
the
sheep
of
the
wilderness
i
was
ill
that
summer
said
he
and
the
doctor
had
ordered
me
to
go
into
the
woods
but
on
no
account
to
go
without
plenty
of
fresh
meat
which
was
essential
to
my
recovery
so
we
set
out
into
the
wild
country
north
of
georgian
bay
taking
a
live
sheep
with
us
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
doctor
prescription
might
be
faithfully
followed
it
was
a
young
and
innocent
little
beast
curling
itself
up
at
my
feet
in
the
canoe
and
following
me
about
on
shore
like
a
dog
i
gathered
grass
every
day
to
feed
it
and
carried
it
in
my
arms
over
the
rough
portages
it
ate
out
of
my
hand
and
rubbed
its
woolly
head
against
my
leggings
to
my
dismay
i
found
that
i
was
beginning
to
love
it
for
its
own
sake
and
without
any
ulterior
motives
the
thought
of
killing
and
eating
it
became
more
and
more
painful
to
me
until
at
length
the
fatal
fascination
was
complete
and
my
trip
became
practically
an
exercise
of
devotion
to
that
sheep
i
carried
it
everywhere
and
ministered
fondly
to
its
wants
not
for
the
world
would
i
have
alluded
to
mutton
in
its
presence
and
when
we
returned
to
civilisation
i
parted
from
the
creature
with
sincere
regret
and
the
consciousness
that
i
had
humoured
my
affections
at
the
expense
of
my
digestion
the
sheep
did
not
give
me
so
much
as
a
look
of
farewell
but
fell
to
feeding
on
the
grass
beside
the
with
an
air
of
placid
triumph
after
hearing
this
touching
tale
i
was
glad
that
no
great
intimacy
had
sprung
up
between
favonius
and
the
chickens
which
we
carried
in
a
coop
on
the
forecastle
head
for
there
is
no
telling
what
restrictions
his
might
have
laid
upon
our
larder
but
perhaps
a
chicken
would
not
have
given
such
an
opening
for
misplaced
affection
as
a
sheep
there
is
a
great
difference
in
animals
in
this
respect
i
certainly
never
heard
of
any
one
falling
in
love
with
a
salmon
in
such
a
way
as
to
regard
it
as
a
fond
companion
and
this
may
be
one
reason
why
no
sensible
person
who
has
tried
fishing
has
ever
been
able
to
see
any
cruelty
in
it
suppose
the
fish
is
not
caught
by
an
angler
what
is
his
alternative
fate
he
will
either
perish
miserably
in
the
struggles
of
the
crowded
net
or
die
of
old
age
and
starvation
like
the
long
lean
stragglers
which
are
sometimes
found
in
the
shallow
pools
or
be
devoured
by
a
larger
fish
or
torn
to
pieces
by
a
seal
or
an
otter
compared
with
any
of
these
miserable
deaths
the
fate
of
a
salmon
who
is
hooked
in
a
clear
stream
and
after
a
glorious
fight
receives
the
happy
despatch
at
the
moment
when
he
touches
the
shore
is
a
sort
of
euthanasia
and
since
the
fish
was
made
to
be
man
food
the
angler
who
brings
him
to
the
table
of
destiny
in
the
cleanest
quickest
kindest
way
is
in
fact
his
benefactor
there
were
some
days
however
when
our
benevolent
intentions
toward
the
salmon
were
frustrated
mornings
when
they
refused
to
rise
and
evenings
when
they
escaped
even
the
skilful
endeavours
of
favonius
in
vain
did
he
try
every
fly
in
his
book
from
the
smallest
silver
doctor
to
the
largest
golden
eagle
the
black
dose
would
not
move
them
the
durham
ranger
covered
the
pool
in
vain
on
days
like
this
if
a
stray
fish
rose
it
was
hard
to
land
him
for
he
was
usually
but
slightly
hooked
i
remember
one
of
these
shy
creatures
which
led
me
a
pretty
dance
at
the
mouth
of
patapedia
he
came
to
the
fly
just
at
dusk
rising
very
softly
and
quietly
as
if
he
did
not
really
care
for
it
but
only
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
he
went
down
at
once
into
deep
water
and
began
the
most
dangerous
and
exasperating
of
all
moving
around
in
slow
circles
and
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
sullen
pertinacity
this
is
called
jigging
and
unless
it
can
be
stopped
the
result
is
fatal
i
could
not
stop
it
that
salmon
was
determined
to
jig
he
knew
more
than
i
did
the
canoe
followed
him
down
the
pool
he
jigged
away
past
all
three
of
the
inlets
of
the
patapedia
and
at
last
in
the
still
deep
water
below
after
we
had
laboured
with
him
for
half
an
hour
and
brought
him
near
enough
to
see
that
he
was
immense
he
calmly
opened
his
mouth
and
the
fly
came
back
to
me
void
that
was
a
sad
evening
in
which
all
the
consolations
of
philosophy
were
needed
sunday
was
a
very
peaceful
day
in
our
camp
in
the
dominion
of
canada
the
question
to
fish
or
not
to
fish
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
is
not
left
to
the
frailty
of
the
individual
conscience
the
law
on
the
subject
is
quite
explicit
and
says
that
between
six
on
saturday
evening
and
six
on
monday
morning
all
nets
shall
be
taken
up
and
no
one
shall
wet
a
line
the
ristigouche
salmon
club
has
its
guardians
stationed
all
along
the
river
and
they
are
quite
as
inflexible
in
seeing
that
their
employers
keep
this
law
as
the
famous
sentinel
was
in
refusing
to
let
napoleon
pass
without
the
countersign
but
i
do
not
think
that
these
keen
sportsmen
regard
it
as
a
hardship
they
are
quite
willing
that
the
fish
should
have
an
off
day
in
every
week
and
only
grumble
because
some
of
the
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
have
brought
political
influence
to
bear
in
their
favour
and
obtained
exemption
from
the
rule
for
our
part
we
were
nothing
loath
to
hang
up
our
rods
and
make
the
day
different
from
other
days
in
the
morning
we
had
a
service
in
the
cabin
of
the
boat
gathering
a
little
congregation
of
guardians
and
boatmen
and
people
from
a
solitary
by
the
river
they
came
in
pirogues
long
narrow
boats
hollowed
from
the
trunk
of
a
tree
the
girls
sitting
back
to
back
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
and
the
men
standing
up
bending
to
their
poles
it
seemed
a
picturesque
way
of
travelling
although
none
too
safe
in
the
afternoon
we
sat
on
deck
and
looked
at
the
water
what
a
charm
there
is
in
watching
a
swift
stream
the
eye
never
wearies
of
following
its
curls
and
eddies
the
shadow
of
the
waves
dancing
over
the
stones
the
strange
crinkling
lines
of
sunlight
in
the
shallows
there
is
a
sort
of
fascination
in
it
lulling
and
soothing
the
mind
into
a
quietude
which
is
even
pleasanter
than
sleep
and
making
it
almost
possible
to
do
that
of
which
we
so
often
speak
but
which
we
never
quite
accomplish
think
about
nothing
out
on
the
edge
of
the
pool
we
could
see
five
or
six
huge
salmon
moving
slowly
from
side
to
side
or
lying
motionless
like
gray
shadows
there
was
nothing
to
break
the
silence
except
the
thin
clear
whistle
of
the
sparrow
far
back
in
the
woods
this
is
almost
the
only
that
one
hears
on
the
river
unless
you
count
the
metallic
of
the
kingfisher
as
a
song
every
now
and
then
one
of
the
salmon
in
the
pool
would
lazily
roll
out
of
water
or
spring
high
into
the
air
and
fall
back
with
a
heavy
splash
what
is
it
that
makes
salmon
leap
is
it
pain
or
pleasure
do
they
do
it
to
escape
the
attack
of
another
fish
or
to
shake
off
a
parasite
that
clings
to
them
or
to
practise
jumping
so
that
they
can
ascend
the
falls
when
they
reach
them
or
simply
and
solely
out
of
exuberant
gladness
and
joy
of
living
any
one
of
these
reasons
would
be
enough
to
account
for
it
on
on
sunday
i
am
quite
sure
they
do
it
for
the
trial
of
the
fisherman
faith
but
how
should
i
tell
all
the
little
incidents
which
made
that
lazy
voyage
so
delightful
favonius
was
the
ideal
host
for
on
water
as
well
as
on
land
he
knows
how
to
provide
for
the
liberty
as
well
as
for
the
wants
of
his
guests
he
understands
also
the
fine
art
of
conversation
which
consists
of
silence
as
well
as
speech
and
when
it
comes
to
angling
izaak
walton
himself
could
not
have
been
a
more
profitable
teacher
by
precept
or
example
indeed
it
is
a
curious
thought
and
one
full
of
sadness
to
a
mind
that
on
the
ristigouche
would
have
been
at
sea
for
the
beloved
father
of
all
fishermen
passed
through
this
world
without
ever
catching
a
salmon
so
ill
does
fortune
match
with
merit
here
below
at
last
the
days
of
idleness
were
ended
we
could
not
fold
our
tents
like
the
arabs
and
as
silently
steal
away
but
we
took
down
the
long
rods
put
away
the
heavy
reels
made
the
canoes
fast
to
the
side
of
the
house
embarked
the
three
horses
on
the
front
deck
and
then
dropped
down
with
the
current
swinging
along
through
the
rapids
and
drifting
slowly
through
the
still
places
now
grounding
on
a
hidden
rock
and
now
sweeping
around
a
sharp
curve
until
at
length
we
saw
the
roofs
of
metapedia
and
the
ugly
bridge
of
the
railway
spanning
the
river
there
we
left
our
floating
house
awkward
and
helpless
like
some
strange
relic
of
the
flood
stranded
on
the
shore
and
as
we
climbed
the
bank
we
looked
back
and
wondered
whether
noah
was
sorry
when
he
said
to
his
ark
alpenrosen
and
goat
milk
nay
let
me
tell
you
there
be
many
that
have
forty
times
our
estates
that
would
give
the
greatest
part
of
it
to
be
healthful
and
cheerful
like
us
who
with
the
expense
of
a
little
money
have
ate
and
drank
and
laughed
and
angled
and
sung
and
slept
securely
and
rose
next
day
and
cast
away
care
and
sung
and
laughed
and
angled
again
which
are
blessings
rich
men
can
not
purchase
with
all
their
money
izaak
walton
the
complete
angler
a
great
deal
of
the
pleasure
of
life
lies
in
bringing
together
things
which
have
no
connection
that
is
the
secret
of
humour
at
least
so
we
are
told
by
the
philosophers
who
explain
the
jests
that
other
men
have
made
and
in
regard
to
travel
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
must
be
illogical
in
order
to
be
entertaining
the
more
contrasts
it
contains
the
better
perhaps
it
was
some
philosophical
reflection
of
this
kind
that
brought
me
to
the
resolution
on
a
certain
summer
day
to
make
a
little
journey
as
straight
as
possible
from
the
streets
of
venice
to
the
lonely
lofty
summit
of
a
tyrolese
mountain
called
for
no
earthly
reason
that
i
can
discover
the
but
apart
from
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
which
i
must
confess
to
passing
over
very
superficially
at
the
time
there
were
other
and
more
cogent
reasons
for
wanting
to
go
from
venice
to
the
big
venetian
it
was
the
first
of
july
and
the
city
on
the
sea
was
becoming
tepid
a
slumbrous
haze
brooded
over
canals
and
palaces
and
churches
it
was
difficult
to
keep
one
conscience
awake
to
baedeker
and
a
sense
of
moral
obligation
ruskin
was
impossible
and
a
was
a
penance
we
floated
lazily
from
one
place
to
another
and
decided
that
after
all
it
was
too
warm
to
go
in
the
cries
of
the
gondoliers
at
the
canal
corners
grew
more
and
more
monotonous
and
dreamy
there
was
danger
of
our
falling
fast
asleep
and
having
to
pay
by
the
hour
for
a
day
repose
in
a
gondola
if
it
grew
much
warmer
we
might
be
compelled
to
stay
until
the
following
winter
in
order
to
recover
energy
enough
to
get
away
all
the
signs
of
the
times
pointed
northward
to
the
mountains
where
we
should
see
glaciers
and
and
pick
alpenrosen
and
drink
goat
milk
fresh
from
the
real
goat
i
the
first
stage
on
the
journey
thither
was
by
rail
to
belluno
about
four
or
five
hours
it
is
a
sufficient
commentary
on
railway
travel
that
the
most
important
thing
about
it
is
to
tell
how
many
hours
it
takes
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
we
arrived
in
belluno
at
night
and
when
we
awoke
the
next
morning
we
found
ourselves
in
a
picturesque
little
city
of
venetian
aspect
with
a
piazza
and
a
campanile
and
a
palladian
cathedral
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
lofty
hills
we
were
at
the
end
of
the
railway
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
dolomites
although
i
have
a
constitutional
aversion
to
scientific
information
given
by
unscientific
persons
such
as
clergymen
and
men
of
letters
i
must
go
in
that
direction
far
enough
to
make
it
clear
that
the
word
dolomite
does
not
describe
a
kind
of
fossil
nor
a
sect
of
heretics
but
a
formation
of
mountains
lying
between
the
alps
and
the
adriatic
draw
a
diamond
on
the
map
with
brixen
at
the
northwest
corner
lienz
at
the
northeast
belluno
at
the
southeast
and
trent
at
the
southwest
and
you
will
have
included
the
region
of
the
dolomites
a
country
so
picturesque
so
interesting
so
full
of
sublime
and
beautiful
scenery
that
it
is
equally
a
wonder
and
a
blessing
that
it
has
not
been
long
since
completely
overrun
by
tourists
and
ruined
with
railways
it
is
true
the
glaciers
and
snowfields
are
limited
the
waterfalls
are
comparatively
few
and
slender
and
the
rivers
small
the
loftiest
peaks
are
little
more
than
ten
thousand
feet
high
but
on
the
other
hand
the
mountains
are
always
near
and
therefore
always
imposing
bold
steep
fantastic
masses
of
naked
rock
they
rise
suddenly
from
the
green
and
flowery
valleys
in
amazing
and
endless
contrast
they
mirror
themselves
in
the
tiny
mountain
lakes
like
pictures
in
a
dream
i
believe
the
says
that
they
are
formed
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
carbonate
of
magnesia
in
chemical
composition
but
even
if
this
be
true
it
need
not
prejudice
any
candid
observer
against
them
for
the
simple
and
fortunate
fact
is
that
they
are
built
of
such
stone
that
wind
and
weather
keen
frost
and
melting
snow
and
rushing
water
have
worn
and
cut
and
carved
them
into
a
thousand
shapes
of
wonder
and
beauty
it
needs
but
little
fancy
to
see
in
them
walls
and
towers
cathedrals
and
campaniles
fortresses
and
cities
tinged
with
many
hues
from
pale
gray
to
deep
red
and
shining
in
an
air
so
soft
so
pure
so
cool
so
fragrant
under
a
sky
so
deep
and
blue
and
a
sunshine
so
genial
that
it
seems
like
the
happy
union
of
switzerland
and
italy
the
great
highway
through
this
region
from
south
to
north
is
the
ampezzo
road
which
was
constructed
in
along
the
valleys
of
the
piave
the
boite
and
the
rienz
the
ancient
line
of
travel
and
commerce
between
venice
and
innsbruck
the
road
is
superbly
built
smooth
and
level
our
carriage
rolled
along
so
easily
that
we
forgot
and
forgave
its
venerable
appearance
and
its
lack
of
accommodation
for
trunks
we
had
been
persuaded
to
take
four
horses
as
our
luggage
seemed
too
formidable
for
a
single
pair
but
in
effect
our
concession
to
apparent
necessity
turned
out
to
be
a
mere
display
of
superfluous
luxury
for
the
two
white
leaders
did
little
more
than
show
their
feeble
paces
leaving
the
gray
wheelers
to
do
the
work
we
had
the
elevating
sense
of
traveling
however
a
satisfaction
to
which
i
do
not
believe
any
human
being
is
altogether
insensible
at
longarone
we
breakfasted
for
the
second
time
and
entered
the
narrow
gorge
of
the
piave
the
road
was
cut
out
of
the
face
of
the
rock
below
us
the
long
went
shooting
down
the
swift
river
above
on
the
right
were
the
jagged
crests
of
monte
furlon
and
premaggiore
which
seemed
to
us
very
wonderful
because
we
had
not
yet
learned
how
jagged
the
dolomites
can
be
at
perarolo
where
the
boite
joins
the
piave
there
is
a
lump
of
a
mountain
in
the
angle
between
the
rivers
and
around
this
we
crawled
in
long
curves
until
we
had
risen
a
thousand
feet
and
arrived
at
the
same
hotel
venezia
where
we
were
to
dine
while
dinner
was
preparing
the
deacon
and
i
walked
up
to
pieve
di
cadore
the
birthplace
of
titian
the
house
in
which
the
great
painter
first
saw
the
colours
of
the
world
is
still
standing
and
tradition
points
out
the
very
room
in
which
he
began
to
paint
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
would
inquire
too
closely
into
such
a
legend
as
this
the
cottage
may
have
been
rebuilt
a
dozen
times
since
titian
day
not
a
scrap
of
the
original
stone
or
plaster
may
remain
but
beyond
a
doubt
the
view
that
we
saw
from
the
window
is
the
same
that
titian
saw
now
for
the
first
time
i
could
understand
and
appreciate
the
of
his
pictures
the
compact
masses
of
mountains
the
bold
sharp
forms
the
hanging
rocks
of
cold
gray
emerging
from
green
slopes
the
intense
blue
aerial
distances
these
all
had
seemed
to
be
unreal
and
imaginary
compositions
of
the
studio
but
now
i
knew
that
whether
titian
painted
like
our
modern
impressionists
or
not
he
certainly
painted
what
he
had
seen
and
painted
it
as
it
is
the
graceful
boy
who
showed
us
the
house
seemed
also
to
belong
to
one
of
titian
pictures
as
we
were
going
away
the
deacon
for
lack
of
copper
rewarded
him
with
a
little
silver
piece
a
in
value
about
ten
cents
a
celestial
rapture
of
surprise
spread
over
the
child
face
and
i
know
not
what
blessings
he
invoked
upon
us
he
called
his
companions
to
rejoice
with
him
and
we
left
them
clapping
their
hands
and
dancing
driving
after
one
has
dined
has
always
a
peculiar
charm
the
motion
seems
pleasanter
the
landscape
finer
than
in
the
morning
hours
the
road
from
cadore
ran
on
a
high
level
through
sloping
pastures
white
villages
and
bits
of
larch
forest
in
its
narrow
bed
far
below
the
river
boite
roared
as
gently
as
bottom
lion
the
afternoon
sunlight
touched
the
pinnacle
of
antelao
and
the
massive
pink
wall
of
sorapis
on
the
right
on
the
left
across
the
valley
monte
pelmo
vast
head
and
the
wild
crests
of
la
rochetta
and
formin
rose
dark
against
the
glowing
sky
the
peasants
lifted
their
hats
as
we
passed
and
gave
us
a
pleasant
evening
greeting
and
so
almost
without
knowing
it
we
slipped
out
of
italy
into
austria
and
drew
up
before
a
bare
square
stone
building
with
the
double
black
eagle
like
a
strange
fowl
split
for
broiling
staring
at
us
from
the
wall
and
an
inscription
to
the
effect
that
this
was
the
royal
and
imperial
austrian
the
officer
saluted
us
so
politely
that
we
felt
quite
sorry
that
his
duty
required
him
to
disturb
our
luggage
the
law
obliged
him
to
open
one
trunk
courtesy
forbade
him
to
open
more
it
was
quickly
done
and
without
having
to
make
any
contribution
to
the
income
of
his
royal
and
imperial
majesty
francis
joseph
we
rolled
on
our
way
through
the
hamlets
of
acqua
bona
and
zuel
into
the
ampezzan
metropolis
of
cortina
at
sundown
the
modest
inn
called
the
star
of
gold
stood
facing
the
public
square
just
below
the
church
and
the
landlady
stood
facing
us
in
the
doorway
with
an
enthusiastic
welcome
altogether
a
most
friendly
and
entertaining
landlady
whose
one
desire
in
life
seemed
to
be
that
we
should
never
regret
having
chosen
her
house
instead
of
the
white
cross
or
the
black
eagle
o
ja
she
had
our
telegram
received
and
would
we
look
at
the
rooms
outlooking
on
the
piazza
with
a
balcony
from
which
we
could
observe
the
festa
of
she
hoped
they
would
please
us
only
come
in
accommodate
yourselves
it
was
all
as
she
promised
three
little
bedrooms
and
a
little
salon
opening
on
a
little
balcony
queer
old
and
framed
embroideries
and
tiles
hanging
on
the
walls
spotless
curtains
and
board
floors
so
white
that
it
would
have
been
a
shame
to
eat
off
them
without
spreading
a
cloth
to
keep
them
from
being
soiled
these
are
the
rooms
of
the
baron
rothschild
when
he
comes
here
always
in
the
summer
with
nine
horses
and
nine
servants
the
baron
rothschild
of
vienna
i
assured
her
that
we
did
not
know
the
baron
but
that
should
make
no
difference
we
would
not
ask
her
to
reduce
the
price
on
account
of
a
little
thing
like
that
she
did
not
quite
grasp
this
idea
but
hoped
that
we
would
not
find
the
pension
too
dear
at
a
dollar
and
and
a
half
cents
a
day
each
with
a
little
extra
for
the
salon
and
the
balcony
the
english
people
all
please
themselves
here
there
comes
many
every
summer
english
bishops
and
their
families
i
inquired
whether
there
were
many
bishops
in
the
house
at
that
moment
no
just
at
present
she
was
very
sorry
none
well
then
i
said
it
is
all
right
we
will
take
the
rooms
good
signora
barbaria
you
did
not
speak
the
american
language
nor
understand
those
curious
perversions
of
thought
which
pass
among
the
americans
for
humour
but
you
understood
how
to
make
a
little
inn
cheerful
and
yours
was
a
very
simple
and
agreeable
art
of
keeping
a
hotel
as
we
sat
in
the
balcony
after
supper
listening
to
the
capital
playing
of
the
village
orchestra
and
the
tyrolese
songs
with
which
they
varied
their
music
we
thought
within
ourselves
that
we
were
fortunate
to
have
fallen
upon
the
star
of
gold
ii
cortina
lies
in
its
valley
like
a
white
shell
that
has
rolled
down
into
a
broad
vase
of
malachite
it
has
about
a
hundred
houses
and
seven
hundred
inhabitants
a
large
church
and
two
small
ones
a
fine
stone
campanile
with
excellent
bells
and
seven
or
eight
little
inns
but
it
is
more
important
than
its
size
would
signify
for
it
is
the
capital
of
the
district
whose
lawful
title
is
magnifica
comunita
di
ampezzo
a
name
conferred
long
ago
by
the
republic
of
venice
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
was
venetian
territory
but
in
under
maximilian
it
was
joined
to
austria
and
it
is
now
one
of
the
richest
and
most
prosperous
communes
of
the
tyrol
it
embraces
about
hundred
people
scattered
in
hamlets
and
clusters
of
houses
through
the
green
basin
with
its
four
entrances
lying
between
the
peaks
of
tofana
cristallo
sorapis
and
nuvolau
the
grain
fields
and
meadows
the
smooth
alps
filled
with
fine
cattle
the
houses
with
their
white
stone
basements
and
balconies
of
dark
brown
wood
and
broad
overhanging
roofs
all
speak
of
industry
and
thrift
but
there
is
more
than
mere
agricultural
prosperity
in
this
valley
there
is
a
fine
race
of
men
and
women
intelligent
vigorous
and
with
a
strong
sense
of
beauty
the
outer
walls
of
the
annex
of
the
hotel
aquila
nera
are
covered
with
frescoes
of
marked
power
and
originality
painted
by
the
son
of
the
innkeeper
the
art
schools
of
cortina
are
famous
for
their
beautiful
work
in
gold
and
silver
filigree
and
there
are
nearly
two
hundred
pupils
in
these
schools
all
peasants
children
and
they
produce
results
especially
in
intarsia
which
are
admirable
the
village
orchestra
of
which
i
spoke
a
moment
ago
is
trained
and
led
by
a
peasant
son
who
has
never
had
a
thorough
musical
education
it
must
have
at
least
members
and
as
we
heard
them
at
the
festa
they
seemed
to
play
with
extraordinary
accuracy
and
expression
this
festa
gave
us
a
fine
chance
to
see
the
people
of
the
ampezzo
all
together
it
was
the
annual
jubilation
of
the
district
and
from
all
the
outlying
hamlets
and
remote
side
valleys
even
from
the
neighbouring
vales
of
agordo
and
auronzo
across
the
mountains
and
from
cadore
the
peasants
men
and
women
and
children
had
come
in
to
the
sagro
at
cortina
the
piazza
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
broadening
of
the
road
behind
the
church
was
quite
thronged
there
must
have
been
between
two
and
three
thousand
people
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
began
with
general
the
people
here
are
honestly
and
naturally
religious
i
have
seen
so
many
examples
of
what
can
only
be
called
sincere
and
unaffected
piety
that
i
can
not
doubt
it
the
church
on
cortina
was
crowded
to
the
doors
with
worshippers
who
gave
every
evidence
of
taking
part
not
only
with
the
voice
but
also
with
the
heart
in
the
worship
then
followed
the
public
unveiling
of
a
tablet
on
the
wall
of
the
little
inn
of
the
anchor
to
the
memory
of
giammaria
ghedini
the
founder
of
the
of
cortina
there
was
music
by
the
band
and
an
oration
by
a
native
demosthenes
who
spoke
in
italian
so
fluent
that
it
ran
through
one
senses
like
water
through
a
sluice
leaving
nothing
behind
and
an
original
canto
sung
by
the
village
choir
with
a
general
chorus
in
which
they
called
upon
the
various
mountains
to
the
name
of
the
beloved
master
as
a
model
of
modesty
and
true
merit
and
wound
up
with
hurrah
for
hurrah
for
his
art
hurrah
for
all
teachers
as
skilful
as
he
hurrah
for
us
all
who
have
now
taken
part
in
singing
together
in
do
re
mi
it
was
very
primitive
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
celebration
was
even
mentioned
in
the
newspapers
of
the
great
world
but
after
all
has
not
the
man
who
wins
such
a
triumph
as
this
in
the
hearts
of
his
own
people
for
whom
he
has
made
labour
beautiful
with
the
charm
of
art
deserved
better
of
fame
than
many
a
crowned
monarch
or
conquering
warrior
we
should
be
wiser
if
we
gave
less
glory
to
the
men
who
have
been
successful
in
forcing
their
to
die
and
more
glory
to
the
men
who
have
been
successful
in
teaching
their
how
to
live
but
the
festa
of
cortina
did
not
remain
all
day
on
this
high
moral
plane
in
the
afternoon
came
what
our
landlady
called
allerlei
dummheiten
there
was
a
grand
lottery
for
the
benefit
of
the
volunteer
fire
department
the
high
officials
sat
up
in
a
green
wooden
booth
in
the
middle
of
the
square
and
called
out
the
numbers
and
distributed
the
prizes
then
there
was
a
greased
pole
with
various
articles
of
an
attractive
character
tied
to
a
large
hoop
at
the
top
silk
aprons
and
a
green
jacket
and
bottles
of
wine
and
half
a
smoked
pig
and
a
coil
of
rope
and
a
purse
the
gallant
firemen
voluntarily
climbed
up
the
pole
as
far
as
they
could
one
after
another
and
then
involuntarily
slid
down
again
exhausted
each
one
wiping
off
a
little
more
of
the
grease
until
at
last
the
lucky
one
came
who
profited
by
his
labours
and
struggled
to
the
top
to
snatch
the
smoked
pig
after
that
it
was
easy
such
is
success
in
this
unequal
world
the
man
who
wipes
off
the
grease
seldom
gets
the
prize
then
followed
various
games
with
tubs
of
water
and
coins
fastened
to
the
bottom
of
a
huge
black
to
be
plucked
off
with
the
lips
and
pots
of
flour
to
be
broken
with
sticks
so
that
the
young
lads
of
the
village
were
ducked
and
blackened
and
powdered
to
an
unlimited
extent
amid
the
hilarious
applause
of
the
spectators
in
the
evening
there
was
more
music
and
the
peasants
danced
in
the
square
the
women
quietly
and
rather
heavily
but
the
men
with
amazing
agility
slapping
the
soles
of
their
shoes
with
their
hands
or
turning
cartwheels
in
front
of
their
partners
at
dark
the
festivities
closed
with
a
display
of
fireworks
there
were
rockets
and
bombs
and
and
the
boys
had
tiny
red
and
blue
lights
which
they
held
until
their
fingers
were
burned
just
as
boys
do
in
america
and
there
was
a
general
hush
of
wonder
as
a
particularly
brilliant
rocket
swished
into
the
dark
sky
and
when
it
burst
into
a
rain
of
serpents
the
crowd
breathed
out
its
delight
in
a
just
as
the
crowd
does
everywhere
we
might
easily
have
imagined
ourselves
at
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
in
vermont
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
costumes
the
men
of
the
ampezzo
valley
have
kept
but
little
that
is
peculiar
in
their
dress
men
are
naturally
more
progressive
than
women
and
therefore
less
picturesque
the
tide
of
fashion
has
swept
them
into
the
international
monotony
of
coat
and
vest
and
trousers
pretty
much
the
same
and
equally
ugly
all
over
the
world
now
and
then
you
may
see
a
short
jacket
with
silver
buttons
or
a
pair
of
and
almost
all
the
youths
wear
a
bunch
of
feathers
or
a
tuft
of
chamois
hair
in
their
soft
green
hats
but
the
women
of
the
ampezzo
strong
comely
with
golden
brown
complexions
and
often
noble
faces
are
not
ashamed
to
dress
as
their
grandmothers
did
they
wear
a
little
round
black
felt
hat
with
rolled
rim
and
two
long
ribbons
hanging
down
at
the
back
their
hair
is
carefully
braided
and
coiled
and
stuck
through
and
through
with
great
silver
pins
a
black
bodice
fastened
with
silver
clasps
is
covered
in
front
with
the
ends
of
a
brilliant
silk
kerchief
laid
in
many
folds
around
the
shoulders
the
white
are
very
full
and
fastened
up
above
the
elbow
with
coloured
ribbon
if
the
weather
is
cool
the
women
wear
a
short
black
jacket
with
satin
yoke
and
high
puffed
sleeves
but
whatever
the
weather
may
be
they
make
no
change
in
the
large
full
dark
skirts
almost
completely
covered
with
immense
silk
aprons
by
preference
light
blue
it
is
not
a
remarkably
brilliant
dress
compared
with
that
which
one
may
still
see
in
some
districts
of
norway
or
sweden
but
upon
the
whole
it
suits
the
women
of
the
ampezzo
wonderfully
for
my
part
i
think
that
when
a
woman
has
found
a
dress
that
becomes
her
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
send
to
paris
for
a
iii
when
the
excitement
of
the
festa
had
subsided
we
were
free
to
abandon
ourselves
to
the
excursions
in
which
the
neighbourhood
of
cortina
abounds
and
to
which
the
earnestly
calls
every
traveller
a
walk
through
the
shadows
of
the
to
the
tiny
lake
of
ghedina
where
we
could
see
all
the
four
dozen
trout
swimming
about
in
the
clear
water
and
catching
flies
a
drive
to
the
belvedere
where
there
are
superficial
refreshments
above
and
profound
grottos
below
these
were
trifles
though
we
enjoyed
them
but
the
great
mountains
encircling
us
on
every
side
standing
out
in
clear
view
with
that
distinctness
and
completeness
of
vision
which
is
one
charm
of
the
dolomites
seemed
to
summon
us
to
more
arduous
enterprises
accordingly
the
deacon
and
i
selected
the
easiest
one
engaged
a
guide
and
prepared
for
the
ascent
monte
nuvolau
is
not
a
perilous
mountain
i
am
quite
sure
that
at
my
present
time
of
life
i
should
be
unwilling
to
ascend
a
perilous
mountain
unless
there
were
something
extraordinarily
desirable
at
the
top
or
remarkably
disagreeable
at
the
bottom
mere
risk
has
lost
the
attractions
which
it
once
had
as
the
father
of
a
family
i
felt
bound
to
abstain
from
going
for
amusement
into
any
place
which
a
christian
lady
might
not
visit
with
propriety
and
safety
our
preparation
for
nuvolau
therefore
did
not
consist
of
ropes
and
axes
but
simply
of
a
lunch
and
two
long
sticks
our
way
led
us
in
the
early
morning
through
the
clustering
houses
of
lacedel
up
the
broad
green
slope
that
faces
cortina
on
the
west
to
the
beautiful
alp
pocol
nothing
could
exceed
the
pleasure
of
such
a
walk
in
the
cool
of
the
day
while
the
dew
still
lies
on
the
short
rich
grass
and
the
myriads
of
flowers
are
at
their
brightest
and
sweetest
the
infinite
variety
and
abundance
of
the
blossoms
is
a
continual
wonder
they
are
sown
more
thickly
than
the
stars
in
heaven
and
the
rainbow
itself
does
not
show
so
many
tints
here
they
are
mingled
like
the
threads
of
some
strange
embroidery
and
there
again
nature
has
massed
her
colours
so
that
one
spot
will
be
all
pale
blue
with
innumerable
or
dark
blue
with
gentians
another
will
blush
with
the
delicate
pink
of
the
santa
lucia
or
the
deeper
red
of
the
clover
and
another
will
shine
yellow
as
cloth
of
gold
over
all
this
opulence
of
bloom
the
larks
were
soaring
and
singing
i
never
heard
so
many
as
in
the
meadows
about
cortina
there
was
always
a
sweet
spray
of
music
sprinkling
down
out
of
the
sky
where
the
singers
poised
unseen
it
was
like
walking
through
a
shower
of
melody
from
the
alp
pocol
which
is
simply
a
fair
lofty
pasture
we
had
our
first
full
view
of
nuvolau
rising
bare
and
strong
like
a
huge
bastion
from
the
dark
through
these
our
way
led
onward
now
for
seven
miles
with
but
a
slight
ascent
then
turning
off
to
the
left
we
began
to
climb
sharply
through
the
forest
there
we
found
abundance
of
the
lovely
alpenrosen
which
do
not
bloom
on
the
lower
ground
their
colour
is
a
deep
glowing
pink
and
when
a
tyrolese
girl
gives
you
one
of
these
flowers
to
stick
in
the
band
of
your
hat
you
may
know
that
you
have
found
favour
in
her
eyes
through
the
wood
the
cuckoo
was
calling
the
bird
which
reverses
the
law
of
good
children
and
insists
on
being
heard
but
not
seen
when
the
forest
was
at
an
end
we
found
ourselves
at
the
foot
of
an
alp
which
sloped
steeply
up
to
the
five
towers
of
averau
the
effect
of
these
enormous
masses
of
rock
standing
out
in
lonely
grandeur
like
the
ruins
of
some
forsaken
habitation
of
giants
was
tremendous
seen
from
far
below
in
the
valley
their
form
was
picturesque
and
striking
but
as
we
sat
beside
the
clear
cold
spring
which
gushes
out
at
the
foot
of
the
largest
tower
the
titanic
rocks
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
above
us
as
if
they
would
overawe
us
into
a
sense
of
their
majesty
we
felt
it
to
the
full
yet
none
the
less
but
rather
the
more
could
we
feel
at
the
same
time
the
delicate
and
ethereal
beauty
of
the
fringed
gentianella
and
the
pale
alpine
lilies
scattered
on
the
short
turf
beside
us
we
had
now
been
on
foot
about
three
hours
and
a
half
the
half
hour
that
remained
was
the
hardest
up
over
loose
broken
stones
that
rolled
beneath
our
feet
up
over
great
slopes
of
rough
rock
up
across
little
fields
of
snow
where
we
paused
to
celebrate
the
fourth
of
july
with
a
brief
snowball
fight
up
along
a
narrowing
ridge
with
a
precipice
on
either
hand
and
so
at
last
to
the
summit
feet
above
the
sea
it
is
not
a
great
height
but
it
is
a
noble
situation
for
nuvolau
is
fortunately
placed
in
the
very
centre
of
the
dolomites
and
so
commands
a
finer
view
than
many
a
higher
mountain
indeed
it
is
not
from
the
highest
peaks
according
to
my
experience
that
one
gets
the
grandest
prospects
but
rather
from
those
of
middle
height
which
are
so
isolated
as
to
give
a
wide
circle
of
vision
and
from
which
one
can
see
both
the
valleys
and
the
summits
monte
rosa
itself
gives
a
less
imposing
view
than
the
gorner
grat
it
is
possible
in
this
world
to
climb
too
high
for
pleasure
but
what
a
panorama
nuvolau
gave
us
on
that
clear
radiant
summer
morning
a
perfect
circle
of
splendid
sight
on
one
side
we
looked
down
upon
the
five
towers
on
the
other
a
thousand
feet
below
the
alps
dotted
with
the
huts
of
the
herdsmen
sloped
down
into
the
vale
of
agordo
opposite
to
us
was
the
enormous
mass
of
tofana
a
pile
of
gray
and
pink
and
saffron
rock
when
we
turned
the
other
way
we
faced
a
group
of
mountains
as
ragged
as
the
crests
of
a
line
of
and
behind
them
loomed
the
solemn
head
of
pelmo
across
the
broad
vale
of
the
boite
antelao
stood
beside
sorapis
like
a
campanile
beside
a
cathedral
and
cristallo
towered
above
the
green
pass
of
the
three
crosses
through
that
opening
we
could
see
the
bristling
peaks
of
the
sextenthal
sweeping
around
in
a
wider
circle
from
that
point
we
saw
beyond
the
durrenstein
the
pile
of
the
the
crimson
bastions
of
the
rothwand
appeared
to
the
north
behind
tofana
then
the
white
slopes
that
hang
far
away
above
the
zillerthal
and
nearer
the
geislerspitze
like
five
fingers
thrust
into
the
air
behind
that
the
distant
oetzthaler
mountain
and
just
a
single
white
glimpse
of
the
highest
peak
of
the
ortler
by
the
engadine
nearer
still
we
saw
the
vast
fortress
of
the
sella
group
and
the
red
combs
of
the
rosengarten
monte
marmolata
the
queen
of
the
dolomites
stood
before
us
revealed
from
base
to
peak
in
a
bridal
dress
of
snow
and
southward
we
looked
into
the
dark
rugged
face
of
la
civetta
rising
sheer
out
of
the
vale
of
agordo
where
the
lake
of
alleghe
slept
unseen
it
was
a
sea
of
mountains
tossed
around
us
into
a
myriad
of
motionless
waves
and
with
a
rainbow
of
colours
spread
among
their
hollows
and
across
their
crests
the
cliffs
of
rose
and
orange
and
silver
gray
the
valleys
of
deepest
green
the
distant
shadows
of
purple
and
melting
blue
and
the
dazzling
white
of
the
scattered
seemed
to
shift
and
vary
like
the
hues
on
the
inside
of
a
shell
and
over
all
from
peak
to
peak
the
light
feathery
clouds
went
drifting
lazily
and
slowly
as
if
they
could
not
leave
a
scene
so
fair
there
is
barely
room
on
the
top
of
nuvolau
for
the
stone
which
a
grateful
saxon
baron
has
built
there
as
a
sort
of
votive
offering
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
among
the
mountains
as
we
sat
within
and
ate
our
frugal
lunch
we
were
glad
that
he
had
recovered
his
health
and
glad
that
he
had
built
the
hut
and
glad
that
we
had
come
to
it
in
fact
we
could
almost
sympathise
in
our
cold
american
way
with
the
sentimental
german
inscription
which
we
read
on
the
wall
von
nuvolau
hohen
wolkenstufen
lass
mich
natur
durch
deine
himmel
rufen
an
deiner
brust
gesunde
wer
da
krank
so
wird
zum
volkerdank
mein
sachsendank
we
refrained
however
from
shouting
anything
through
nature
heaven
but
went
lightly
down
in
about
three
hours
to
supper
in
the
star
of
gold
iv
when
a
stern
necessity
forces
one
to
leave
cortina
there
are
several
ways
of
departure
we
selected
the
main
highway
for
our
trunks
but
for
ourselves
the
pass
of
the
three
crosses
the
deacon
and
the
deaconess
in
a
mountain
waggon
and
i
on
foot
it
should
be
written
as
an
axiom
in
the
philosophy
of
travel
that
the
easiest
way
is
best
for
your
luggage
and
the
hardest
way
is
best
for
yourself
all
along
the
rough
road
up
to
the
pass
we
had
a
glorious
outlook
backward
over
the
val
d
ampezzo
and
when
we
came
to
the
top
we
looked
deep
down
into
the
narrow
val
buona
behind
sorapis
i
do
not
know
just
when
we
passed
the
austrian
border
but
when
we
came
to
lake
misurina
we
found
ourselves
in
italy
again
my
friends
went
on
down
the
valley
to
landro
but
i
in
my
weakness
having
eaten
of
the
trout
of
the
lake
for
dinner
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
staying
to
catch
one
for
breakfast
it
was
a
pleasant
failure
the
lake
was
beautiful
lying
on
top
of
the
mountain
like
a
bit
of
blue
sky
surrounded
by
the
peaks
of
cristallo
cadino
and
the
drei
zinnen
it
was
a
happiness
to
float
on
such
celestial
waters
and
cast
the
hopeful
fly
the
trout
were
there
they
were
large
i
saw
them
they
also
saw
me
but
alas
i
could
not
raise
them
misurina
is
in
fact
what
the
scotch
call
a
dour
loch
one
of
those
places
which
are
outwardly
beautiful
but
inwardly
so
demoralised
that
the
trout
will
not
rise
when
we
came
ashore
in
the
evening
the
boatman
consoled
me
with
the
story
of
a
french
count
who
had
spent
two
weeks
there
fishing
and
only
caught
one
fish
i
had
some
thoughts
of
staying
thirteen
days
longer
to
rival
the
count
but
concluded
to
go
on
the
next
morning
over
monte
pian
and
the
cat
ladder
to
landro
the
view
from
monte
pian
is
far
less
extensive
than
that
from
nuvolau
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
very
near
the
wild
jumble
of
the
sexten
dolomites
the
three
shoemakers
and
a
lot
more
of
sharp
and
ragged
fellows
are
close
by
on
the
east
on
the
west
cristallo
shows
its
fine
little
glacier
and
rothwand
its
crimson
cliffs
and
southward
misurina
gives
to
the
view
a
glimpse
of
water
without
which
indeed
no
view
is
complete
moreover
the
mountain
has
the
merit
of
being
as
its
name
implies
quite
gentle
i
met
the
deacon
and
the
deaconess
at
the
top
they
having
walked
up
from
landro
and
so
we
crossed
the
boundary
line
together
again
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
from
italy
into
austria
there
was
no
the
way
down
by
the
cat
ladder
i
travelled
alone
the
path
was
very
steep
and
little
worn
but
even
on
the
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
it
for
it
had
been
blazed
here
and
there
on
trees
and
stones
with
a
dash
of
blue
paint
this
is
the
work
of
the
invaluable
doav
which
is
being
interpreted
the
alpine
club
the
more
one
travels
in
the
mountains
the
more
one
learns
to
venerate
this
beneficent
society
for
the
and
it
has
erected
and
the
paths
it
has
made
and
marked
distinctly
with
various
colours
the
germans
have
a
genius
for
thoroughness
my
little
brown
for
example
not
only
informed
me
through
whose
back
yard
i
must
go
to
get
into
a
certain
path
but
it
told
me
that
in
such
and
such
a
spot
i
should
find
quite
a
good
deal
ziemlichviel
of
edelweiss
and
in
another
a
small
echo
it
advised
me
in
one
valley
to
take
provisions
and
dispense
with
a
guide
and
in
another
to
take
a
guide
and
dispense
with
provisions
adding
varied
information
in
regard
to
beer
which
in
my
case
was
useless
for
i
could
not
touch
it
to
go
astray
under
such
auspices
would
be
worse
than
inexcusable
landro
we
found
a
very
different
place
from
cortina
instead
of
having
a
large
church
and
a
number
of
small
hotels
it
consists
entirely
of
one
large
hotel
and
a
very
tiny
church
it
does
not
lie
in
a
broad
open
basin
but
in
a
narrow
valley
shut
in
closely
by
the
mountains
the
hotel
in
spite
of
its
size
is
excellent
and
a
few
steps
up
the
valley
is
one
of
the
finest
views
in
the
dolomites
to
the
east
opens
a
deep
wild
gorge
at
the
head
of
which
the
pinnacles
of
the
drei
zinnen
are
seen
to
the
south
the
durrensee
fills
the
valley
from
edge
to
edge
and
reflects
in
its
pale
waters
the
huge
bulk
of
monte
cristallo
it
is
such
a
complete
picture
so
finished
so
compact
so
balanced
that
one
might
think
a
painter
had
composed
it
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
but
no
painter
ever
laid
such
colours
on
his
canvas
as
those
which
are
seen
here
when
the
cool
evening
shadows
have
settled
upon
the
valley
all
gray
and
green
while
the
mountains
shine
above
in
rosy
alpenglow
as
if
transfigured
with
inward
fire
there
is
another
lake
about
three
miles
north
of
landro
called
the
toblacher
see
and
there
i
repaired
the
defeat
of
misurina
the
trout
at
the
outlet
by
the
bridge
were
very
small
and
while
the
old
fisherman
was
endeavouring
to
catch
some
of
them
in
his
new
net
which
would
not
work
i
pushed
my
boat
up
to
the
head
of
the
lake
where
the
stream
came
in
the
green
water
was
amazingly
clear
but
the
current
kept
the
fish
with
their
heads
up
stream
so
that
one
could
come
up
behind
them
near
enough
for
a
long
cast
without
being
seen
as
my
fly
lighted
above
them
and
came
gently
down
with
the
ripple
i
saw
the
first
fish
turn
and
rise
and
take
it
a
motion
of
the
wrist
hooked
him
and
he
played
just
as
gamely
as
a
trout
in
my
favourite
long
island
pond
how
different
the
colour
though
as
he
came
out
of
the
water
this
fellow
was
all
silvery
with
light
pink
spots
on
his
sides
i
took
seven
of
his
companions
in
weight
some
four
pounds
and
then
stopped
because
the
evening
light
was
failing
how
pleasant
it
is
to
fish
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
an
hour
the
novelty
of
the
scene
the
grandeur
of
the
landscape
lend
a
strange
charm
to
the
sport
but
the
sport
itself
is
so
familiar
that
one
feels
at
home
the
motion
of
the
rod
the
feathery
swish
of
the
line
the
sight
of
the
rising
fish
it
all
brings
back
a
hundred
woodland
memories
and
thoughts
of
good
fishing
comrades
some
far
away
across
the
sea
and
perhaps
even
now
sitting
around
the
forest
in
maine
or
canada
and
some
with
whom
we
shall
keep
company
no
more
until
we
cross
the
greater
ocean
into
that
happy
country
whither
they
have
preceded
us
instead
of
going
straight
down
the
valley
by
the
high
road
a
drive
of
an
hour
to
the
railway
in
the
pusterthal
i
walked
up
over
the
mountains
to
the
east
across
the
platzwiesen
and
so
down
through
the
pragserthal
in
one
arm
of
the
deep
vale
are
the
baths
of
famous
for
having
cured
the
countess
of
gorz
of
a
violent
rheumatism
in
the
fifteenth
century
it
is
an
antiquated
establishment
and
the
guests
who
were
walking
about
in
the
fields
or
drinking
their
coffee
in
the
balcony
had
a
fifteenth
century
look
about
them
venerable
but
slightly
ruinous
but
perhaps
that
was
merely
a
rheumatic
result
all
the
waggons
in
the
place
were
engaged
it
is
strange
what
an
aggravating
effect
this
state
of
affairs
has
upon
a
pedestrian
who
is
bent
upon
riding
i
did
not
recover
my
delight
in
the
scenery
until
i
had
walked
about
five
miles
farther
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
beside
a
beautiful
spring
to
eat
my
lunch
what
is
there
in
a
little
physical
rest
that
has
such
magic
to
restore
the
sense
of
pleasure
a
few
moments
ago
nothing
pleased
you
the
bloom
was
gone
from
the
peach
but
now
it
has
come
back
again
you
wonder
and
admire
thus
cheerful
and
contented
i
trudged
up
the
right
arm
of
the
valley
to
the
baths
of
less
venerable
but
apparently
more
popular
than
and
on
beyond
them
through
the
woods
to
the
superb
a
lake
whose
still
waters
now
blue
as
sapphire
under
the
clear
sky
and
now
green
as
emerald
under
gray
clouds
sleep
encircled
by
mighty
precipices
could
anything
be
a
greater
contrast
with
venice
there
the
canals
alive
with
gondolas
and
the
open
harbour
bright
with
sails
here
the
hidden
lake
silent
and
lifeless
save
when
a
leaping
fish
sends
through
the
tarn
a
lonely
cheer
tired
and
a
little
after
nine
hours
walking
i
came
into
the
big
railway
hotel
at
toblach
that
night
there
i
met
my
friends
again
and
parted
from
them
and
the
dolomites
the
next
day
with
regret
for
they
were
stepping
westward
but
in
order
to
get
to
the
i
must
make
a
detour
to
the
east
through
the
pusterthal
and
come
up
through
the
valley
of
the
isel
to
the
great
chain
of
mountains
called
the
hohe
tauern
at
the
junction
of
the
isel
and
the
drau
lies
the
quaint
little
city
of
lienz
with
its
two
castles
the
square
one
in
the
town
now
transformed
into
the
offices
of
the
municipality
and
the
huge
mediaeval
one
on
a
hill
outside
now
used
as
a
damp
restaurant
and
dismal
i
lingered
at
lienz
for
a
couple
of
days
in
the
ancient
hostelry
of
the
post
the
hallways
were
vaulted
like
a
cloister
the
walls
were
three
feet
thick
the
kitchen
was
in
the
middle
of
the
house
on
the
second
floor
so
that
i
looked
into
it
every
time
i
came
from
my
room
and
ordered
dinner
direct
from
the
cook
but
so
far
from
being
displeased
with
these
peculiarities
i
rather
liked
the
flavour
of
them
and
then
in
addition
the
landlady
daughter
who
was
managing
the
house
was
a
person
of
most
engaging
manners
and
there
was
trout
and
grayling
fishing
in
a
stream
near
by
and
the
neighbouring
church
of
dolsach
contained
the
beautiful
picture
of
the
holy
family
which
franz
defregger
painted
for
his
native
village
the
peasant
women
of
lienz
have
one
very
striking
feature
in
their
dress
a
black
felt
hat
with
a
broad
stiff
brim
and
a
high
crown
smaller
at
the
top
than
at
the
base
it
looks
a
little
like
the
traditional
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
exaggerated
there
is
a
solemnity
about
it
which
is
fatal
to
feminine
beauty
i
went
by
the
with
two
slow
horses
and
ten
passengers
fifteen
miles
up
the
iselthal
to
a
village
whose
early
history
is
lost
in
the
mist
of
antiquity
and
whose
streets
are
pervaded
with
odours
which
must
have
originated
at
the
same
time
with
the
village
one
wishes
that
they
also
might
have
shared
the
fate
of
its
early
history
but
it
is
not
fair
to
expect
too
much
of
a
small
place
and
has
certainly
a
beautiful
situation
and
a
good
inn
there
i
took
my
guide
a
wiry
and
companionable
little
man
whose
occupation
in
the
lower
world
was
that
of
a
maker
and
merchant
of
hats
and
set
out
for
the
pragerhutte
a
shelter
on
the
side
of
the
the
path
led
under
the
walls
of
the
old
castle
of
weissenstein
and
then
in
steep
curves
up
the
cliff
which
blocks
the
head
of
the
valley
and
along
a
cut
in
the
face
of
the
rock
into
the
steep
narrow
tauernthal
which
divides
the
glockner
group
from
the
venediger
how
entirely
different
it
was
from
the
region
of
the
dolomites
there
the
variety
of
colour
was
endless
and
the
change
incessant
here
it
was
all
green
grass
and
trees
and
black
rocks
with
glimpses
of
snow
there
the
highest
mountains
were
in
sight
constantly
here
they
could
only
be
seen
from
certain
points
in
the
valley
there
the
streams
played
but
a
small
part
in
the
landscape
here
they
were
prominent
the
main
river
raging
and
foaming
through
the
gorge
below
while
a
score
of
waterfalls
leaped
from
the
cliffs
on
either
side
and
dashed
down
to
join
it
the
peasants
men
women
and
children
were
cutting
the
grass
in
the
perpendicular
fields
the
woodmen
were
trimming
and
felling
the
trees
in
the
the
were
driving
their
cows
along
the
stony
path
or
herding
them
far
up
on
the
hillsides
it
was
a
lonely
scene
and
yet
a
busy
one
and
all
along
the
road
was
written
the
history
of
the
perils
and
hardships
of
the
life
which
now
seemed
so
peaceful
and
picturesque
under
the
summer
sunlight
these
heavy
crosses
each
covered
with
a
narrow
pointed
roof
and
decorated
with
a
rude
picture
standing
beside
the
path
or
on
the
bridge
or
near
the
mill
what
do
they
mean
they
mark
the
place
where
a
human
life
has
been
lost
or
where
some
poor
peasant
has
been
delivered
from
a
great
peril
and
has
set
up
a
memorial
of
his
gratitude
stop
traveller
as
you
pass
by
and
look
at
the
pictures
they
have
little
more
of
art
than
a
child
drawing
on
a
slate
but
they
will
teach
you
what
it
means
to
earn
a
living
in
these
mountains
they
tell
of
the
danger
that
lurks
on
the
steep
slopes
of
grass
where
the
mowers
have
to
go
down
with
ropes
around
their
waists
and
in
the
beds
of
the
streams
where
the
floods
sweep
through
in
the
spring
and
in
the
forests
where
the
great
trees
fall
and
crush
men
like
flies
and
on
the
icy
bridges
where
a
slip
is
fatal
and
on
the
high
passes
where
the
winter
snowstorm
blinds
the
eyes
and
benumbs
the
limbs
of
the
traveller
and
under
the
cliffs
from
which
avalanches
slide
and
rocks
roll
they
show
you
men
and
women
falling
from
waggons
and
swept
away
by
waters
and
overwhelmed
in
in
the
corner
of
the
picture
you
may
see
a
peasant
with
the
black
cross
above
his
head
that
means
death
or
perhaps
it
is
deliverance
that
the
tablet
commemorates
and
then
you
will
see
the
miller
kneeling
beside
his
mill
with
a
flood
rushing
down
upon
it
or
a
peasant
kneeling
in
his
under
an
cloud
or
a
landlord
beside
his
inn
in
flames
or
a
mother
praying
beside
her
sick
children
and
above
appears
an
angel
or
a
saint
or
the
virgin
with
her
child
read
the
inscriptions
too
in
their
quaint
german
some
of
them
are
as
humourous
as
the
epitaphs
in
new
england
graveyards
i
remember
one
which
ran
like
this
here
lies
elias
queer
killed
in
his
sixtieth
year
scarce
had
he
seen
the
light
of
day
when
a
crushed
his
life
away
and
there
is
another
famous
one
which
says
here
perished
the
honoured
and
virtuous
maiden
this
tablet
was
erected
by
her
only
son
but
for
the
most
part
a
glance
at
these
marterl
und
taferl
which
are
so
frequent
on
all
the
of
the
tyrol
will
give
you
a
strange
sense
of
the
real
pathos
of
human
life
if
you
are
a
catholic
you
will
not
refuse
their
request
to
say
a
prayer
for
the
departed
if
you
are
a
protestant
at
least
it
will
not
hurt
you
to
say
one
for
those
who
still
live
and
suffer
and
toil
among
such
dangers
after
we
had
walked
for
four
hours
up
the
tauernthal
we
came
to
the
an
inn
which
is
kept
open
all
the
year
for
the
shelter
of
travellers
over
the
high
pass
that
crosses
the
at
this
point
from
north
to
south
there
we
dined
it
was
a
bare
rude
place
but
the
dish
of
juicy
trout
was
garnished
with
flowers
each
fish
holding
a
big
pansy
in
its
mouth
and
as
the
maid
set
them
down
before
me
she
wished
me
a
good
appetite
with
the
hearty
tyrolese
courtesy
which
still
survives
in
these
remote
valleys
it
is
pleasant
to
travel
in
a
land
where
the
manners
are
plain
and
good
if
you
meet
a
peasant
on
the
road
he
says
god
greet
you
if
you
give
a
child
a
couple
of
kreuzers
he
folds
his
hands
and
says
god
reward
you
and
the
maid
who
lights
you
to
bed
says
goodnight
i
hope
you
will
sleep
well
two
hours
more
of
walking
brought
us
through
and
two
groups
of
herdsmen
huts
tenanted
only
in
summer
at
the
head
of
the
tauernthal
midway
between
them
lies
a
little
chapel
cut
into
the
solid
rock
for
shelter
from
the
avalanches
this
lofty
vale
is
indeed
rightly
named
for
it
is
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
portal
is
a
cliff
down
which
the
stream
rushes
in
foam
and
thunder
on
either
hand
rises
a
mountain
wall
within
the
pasture
is
fresh
and
green
sprinkled
with
alpine
roses
and
the
pale
river
flows
swiftly
down
between
the
rows
of
dark
wooden
houses
at
the
head
of
the
vale
towers
the
with
its
glaciers
and
dazzling
white
against
the
deep
blue
heaven
the
murmur
of
the
stream
and
the
tinkle
of
the
and
the
jodelling
of
the
herdsmen
far
up
the
slopes
make
the
music
for
the
scene
the
path
from
gschloss
leads
straight
up
to
the
foot
of
the
dark
pyramid
of
the
kesselkopf
and
then
in
steep
endless
along
the
edge
of
the
great
glacier
i
saw
at
first
the
pinnacles
of
ice
far
above
me
breaking
over
the
face
of
the
rock
then
after
an
hour
breathless
climbing
i
could
look
right
into
the
blue
crevasses
and
at
last
after
another
hour
over
soft
and
broken
rocks
i
was
at
the
pragerhut
perched
on
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
looking
down
upon
the
huge
river
of
ice
it
was
a
magnificent
view
under
the
clear
light
of
evening
here
in
front
of
us
the
venediger
with
all
his
clustered
about
him
behind
us
across
the
tauern
the
mighty
chain
of
the
glockner
against
the
eastern
sky
this
is
the
frozen
world
here
the
winter
driven
back
into
his
stronghold
makes
his
last
stand
against
the
summer
in
perpetual
conflict
retreating
by
day
to
the
but
creeping
back
at
night
in
frost
and
snow
to
regain
a
little
of
his
lost
territory
until
at
last
the
summer
is
wearied
out
and
the
winter
sweeps
down
again
to
claim
the
whole
valley
for
his
own
vi
in
the
pragerhut
i
found
mountain
comfort
there
were
bunks
along
the
wall
of
the
with
plenty
of
blankets
there
was
good
store
of
eggs
canned
meats
and
nourishing
black
bread
the
friendly
goats
came
bleating
up
to
the
door
at
nightfall
to
be
milked
and
in
charge
of
all
this
luxury
there
was
a
cheerful
with
her
daughter
to
entertain
travellers
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
them
as
they
sat
down
to
their
supper
with
my
guide
all
three
bowed
their
heads
and
said
their
grace
before
meat
the
guide
repeating
the
longer
prayer
and
the
mother
and
daughter
coming
in
with
the
responses
i
went
to
bed
with
a
warm
and
comfortable
feeling
about
my
heart
it
was
a
good
ending
for
the
day
in
the
morning
if
the
weather
remained
clear
the
was
to
wake
us
at
three
for
the
ascent
to
the
summit
but
can
it
be
three
already
the
gibbous
moon
still
hangs
in
the
sky
and
casts
a
feeble
light
over
the
scene
then
up
and
away
for
the
final
climb
how
rough
the
path
is
among
the
black
rocks
along
the
ridge
now
we
strike
out
on
the
gently
rising
glacier
across
the
crust
of
snow
picking
our
way
among
the
crevasses
with
the
rope
tied
about
our
waists
for
fear
of
a
fall
how
cold
it
is
but
now
the
gray
light
of
morning
dawns
and
now
the
beams
of
sunrise
shoot
up
behind
the
glockner
and
now
the
sun
itself
glitters
into
sight
the
snow
grows
softer
as
we
toil
up
the
steep
narrow
comb
between
the
and
his
neighbour
the
at
last
we
have
reached
our
journey
end
see
the
whole
of
the
tyrol
is
spread
out
before
us
in
wondrous
splendour
as
we
stand
on
this
snowy
ridge
and
at
our
feet
the
schlatten
glacier
like
a
long
white
snake
curls
down
into
the
valley
there
is
still
a
little
peak
above
us
an
overhanging
horn
of
snow
which
the
wind
has
built
against
the
i
would
like
to
stand
there
just
for
a
moment
the
guide
protests
it
would
be
dangerous
for
if
the
snow
should
break
it
would
be
a
fall
of
a
thousand
feet
to
the
glacier
on
the
northern
side
but
let
us
dare
the
few
steps
upward
how
our
feet
sink
is
the
snow
slipping
look
at
the
glacier
what
is
happening
it
is
wrinkling
and
curling
backward
on
us
its
head
rises
far
above
us
all
its
icy
crests
are
clashing
together
like
the
ringing
of
a
thousand
bells
we
are
falling
i
fling
out
my
arm
to
grasp
the
guide
and
awake
to
find
myself
clutching
a
pillow
in
the
bunk

is
ringing
fiercely
for
three
a
driving
is
beating
against
the
window
the
ground
is

through
the
clouds

i
may
i
can
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
vanished
au

we
strayed
the
same
tranquil
leisure

us

followed

in
an
order
unbroken
and
peaceful
as
the
unfolding
of
the
flowers
and
the
silent
march
of
the

time
no
longer
ran
like
the
few
sands
in
a
delicate
held
by
a
fragile
human
hand
but
like
a
majestic
river
fed
by
fathomless
seas
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
the
sweetness
of
that
unmeasured
life
without
thought
of
yesterday
or
we
drank
the
cup
held
to
our
lips

were
athirst

built

will
never

this
outlying

to
the
civilised
world
and
at
the
end
of
the
railroad
the
hotel
roberval
standing
on
a
hill
above
the
lake
offers
to
the
pampered
tourist
electric
lights
and
and
a
wide
veranda
from
which
he
can
look
out
across
the
water
into
the
face
of
the
wilderness
northward
and
westward
the
interminable
forest
rolls
away
to
the
shores
of
hudson
bay
and
the
frozen
wastes
of
labrador
it
is
an
immense
solitude
a
score
of
rivers
empty
into
the
lake
little
ones
like
the
pikouabi
and
la
pipe
and
ones
like
the
ouiatehouan
and
la
belle
riviere
and
big
ones
like
the
mistassini
and
the
peribonca
and
each
of
these
streams
is
the
clue
to
a
labyrinth
of
woods
and
waters
the
who
follows
it
far
enough
will
find
himself
among
lakes
that
are
not
named
on
any
map
he
will
camp
on
virgin
ground
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
unsophisticated
fish
perhaps
even
like
the
maiden
in
the
he
will
meet
with
the
little
bear
and
the
bear
and
the
great
big
bear
damon
and
i
set
out
on
such
an
expedition
shortly
after
the
nodding
lilies
in
the
connecticut
meadows
had
rung
the
bell
of
summer
and
when
the
raspberry
bushes
along
the
line
of
the
quebec
and
lake
john
railway
had
spread
their
afternoon
collation
for
birds
and
men
at
roberval
we
found
our
four
guides
waiting
for
us
and
the
steamboat
took
us
all
across
the
lake
to
the
island
house
at
the
northeast
corner
there
we
embarked
our
tents
and
blankets
our
pots
and
pans
and
bags
of
flour
and
potatoes
and
bacon
and
other
delicacies
our
rods
and
guns
and
last
but
not
least
our
axes
without
which
man
in
the
woods
is
a
helpless
creature
in
two
canoes
and
went
flying
down
the
grande
decharge
it
is
a
wonderful
place
this
outlet
of
lake
john
all
the
floods
of
twenty
rivers
are
gathered
here
and
break
forth
through
a
net
of
islands
in
a
double
stream
divided
by
the
broad
ile
into
the
grande
decharge
and
the
petite
decharge
the
southern
outlet
is
small
and
flows
somewhat
more
quietly
at
first
but
the
northern
outlet
is
a
huge
confluence
and
tumult
of
waters
you
see
the
set
of
the
tide
far
out
in
the
lake
sliding
driving
crowding
hurrying
in
with
smooth
currents
and
swirling
eddies
toward
the
corner
of
escape
by
the
rocky
cove
where
the
island
house
peers
out
through
the
the
current
already
has
a
perceptible
slope
it
begins
to
boil
over
hidden
stones
in
the
middle
and
gurgles
at
projecting
points
of
rock
a
mile
farther
down
there
is
an
islet
where
the
stream
quickens
chafes
and
breaks
into
a
rapid
behind
the
islet
it
drops
down
in
three
or
four
foaming
steps
on
the
outside
it
makes
one
long
straight
rush
into
a
line
of
standing
waves
as
we
approached
the
steersman
in
the
first
canoe
stood
up
to
look
over
the
course
the
sea
was
high
was
it
too
high
the
canoes
were
heavily
loaded
could
they
leap
the
waves
there
was
a
quick
talk
among
the
guides
as
we
slipped
along
undecided
which
way
to
turn
then
the
question
seemed
to
settle
itself
as
most
of
these
woodland
questions
do
as
if
some
silent
force
of
nature
had
the
sautez
sautez
cried
ferdinand
envoyez
au
large
in
a
moment
we
were
sliding
down
the
smooth
back
of
the
rapid
directly
toward
the
first
big
wave
the
rocky
shore
went
by
us
like
a
dream
we
could
feel
the
motion
of
the
earth
whirling
around
with
us
the
crest
of
the
billow
in
front
curled
above
the
bow
of
the
canoe
arret
arret
doucement
a
swift
stroke
of
the
paddle
checked
the
canoe
quivering
and
prancing
like
a
horse
suddenly
reined
in
the
wave
ahead
as
if
surprised
sank
and
flattened
for
a
second
the
canoe
leaped
through
the
edge
of
it
swerved
to
one
side
and
ran
gayly
down
along
the
fringe
of
the
line
of
billows
into
quieter
water
every
one
feels
the
exhilaration
of
such
a
descent
i
know
a
lady
who
almost
cried
with
fright
when
she
went
down
her
first
rapid
but
before
the
voyage
was
ended
she
was
saying
count
that
day
lost
whose
low
descending
sun
sees
no
fall
leaped
no
foaming
rapid
run
it
takes
a
touch
of
danger
to
bring
out
the
joy
of
life
our
guides
began
to
shout
and
joke
each
other
and
praise
their
canoes
you
grazed
that
villain
rock
at
the
corner
said
jean
did
you
know
where
it
was
yes
after
i
touched
it
cried
ferdinand
but
you
took
in
a
bucket
of
water
and
i
suppose
your
is
sitting
on
a
piece
of
the
river
is
it
not
this
seemed
to
us
all
a
very
merry
jest
and
we
laughed
with
the
same
inextinguishable
laughter
which
a
practical
joke
according
to
homer
always
used
to
raise
in
olympus
it
is
one
of
the
charms
of
life
in
the
woods
that
it
brings
back
the
high
spirits
of
boyhood
and
renews
the
youth
of
the
world
plain
fun
like
plain
food
tastes
good
nectar
is
the
sweet
sap
of
a
ambrosia
is
only
another
name
for
flapjacks
and
all
the
immortals
sitting
around
the
table
of
golden
make
merry
when
the
clumsy
hephaistos
playing
the
part
of
hebe
stumbles
over
a
root
and
upsets
the
plate
of
cakes
into
the
fire
the
first
little
rapid
of
the
grande
decharge
was
only
the
beginning
half
a
mile
below
we
could
see
the
river
disappear
between
two
points
of
rock
there
was
a
roar
of
conflict
and
a
golden
mist
hanging
in
the
air
like
the
smoke
of
battle
all
along
the
place
where
the
river
sank
from
sight
dazzling
heads
of
foam
were
flashing
up
and
falling
back
as
if
a
horde
of
were
vainly
trying
to
fight
their
way
up
to
the
lake
it
was
the
top
of
the
grande
chute
a
wild
succession
of
falls
and
pools
where
no
boat
could
live
for
a
moment
we
ran
down
toward
it
as
far
as
the
water
served
and
then
turned
off
among
the
rocks
on
the
left
hand
to
take
the
portage
these
portages
are
among
the
troublesome
delights
of
a
journey
in
the
wilderness
to
the
guides
they
mean
hard
work
for
everything
including
the
boats
must
be
carried
on
their
backs
the
march
of
the
canoes
on
dry
land
is
a
curious
sight
andrew
marvell
described
it
two
hundred
years
ago
when
he
was
poetizing
beside
the
little
river
wharfe
in
yorkshire
and
now
the
moist
their
leathern
boats
begin
to
hoist
and
like
antipodes
in
shoes
have
shod
their
heads
in
their
canoes
how
but
none
so
slow
these
rational
amphibii
go
but
the
sportsman
carries
nothing
except
perhaps
his
gun
or
his
rod
or
his
photographic
camera
and
so
for
him
the
portage
is
only
a
pleasant
opportunity
to
stretch
his
legs
cramped
by
sitting
in
the
canoe
and
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
pretty
things
that
are
in
the
woods
we
sauntered
along
the
trail
damon
and
i
as
if
school
were
out
and
would
never
keep
again
how
fresh
and
tonic
the
forest
seemed
as
we
plunged
into
its
bath
of
shade
there
were
our
old
friends
the
cedars
with
their
roots
twisted
across
the
path
and
the
white
birches
so
trim
in
youth
and
so
shaggy
in
age
and
the
sociable
spruces
and
balsams
crowding
close
together
and
interlacing
their
arms
overhead
there
were
the
little
springs
trickling
through
the
moss
and
the
slippery
logs
laid
across
the
marshy
places
and
the
fallen
trees
cut
in
two
and
pushed
aside
for
this
was
a
portage
around
the
open
spaces
the
tall
stood
dressed
in
robes
of
fairy
white
and
green
the
blue
banners
of
the
were
planted
beside
the
springs
in
shady
corners
deeper
in
the
wood
the
fragrant
pyrola
lifted
its
scape
of
clustering
bells
like
a
lily
of
the
valley
wandered
to
the
forest
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
portage
a
perfume
like
that
of
cyclamens
in
tyrolean
meadows
welcomed
us
and
searching
among
the
loose
grasses
by
the
we
found
the
exquisite
purple
spikes
of
the
lesser
fringed
orchis
loveliest
and
most
ethereal
of
all
the
woodland
flowers
save
one
and
what
one
is
that
ah
my
friend
it
is
your
own
particular
favourite
the
flower
by
whatever
name
you
call
it
that
you
plucked
long
ago
when
you
were
walking
in
the
forest
with
your
sweetheart
im
wunderschonen
monat
mai
als
alle
knospen
sprangen
we
launched
our
canoes
again
on
the
great
pool
at
the
foot
of
the
first
fall
a
broad
sweep
of
water
a
mile
long
and
half
a
mile
wide
full
of
eddies
and
strong
currents
and
covered
with
drifting
foam
there
was
the
old
campground
on
the
point
where
i
had
tented
so
often
with
my
lady
greygown
fishing
for
ouananiche
the
famous
salmon
of
lake
john
and
there
were
the
big
fish
showing
their
back
fins
as
they
circled
lazily
around
in
the
eddies
as
if
they
were
waiting
to
play
with
us
but
the
goal
of
our
day
journey
was
miles
away
and
we
swept
along
with
the
stream
now
through
a
rush
of
quick
water
boiling
and
foaming
now
through
a
still
place
like
a
lake
now
through
fairy
crowds
of
islands
that
together
lie
as
quietly
as
spots
of
sky
among
the
evening
clouds
the
beauty
of
the
shores
was
infinitely
varied
and
unspoiled
by
any
sign
of
the
presence
of
man
we
met
no
company
except
a
few
and
a
pair
of
gulls
who
had
come
up
from
the
sea
to
spend
the
summer
and
a
large
flock
of
wild
ducks
which
the
guides
call
betseys
as
if
they
were
all
of
the
gentler
sex
in
such
a
big
family
of
girls
we
supposed
that
a
few
would
not
be
missed
and
damon
bagged
two
of
the
tenderest
for
our
supper
in
the
still
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
riviere
mistook
just
above
the
rapide
aux
cedres
we
went
ashore
on
a
level
wooded
bank
to
make
our
first
camp
and
cook
our
dinner
let
me
try
to
sketch
our
men
as
they
are
busied
about
the
fire
they
are
all
french
canadians
of
unmixed
blood
descendants
of
the
men
who
came
to
new
france
with
samuel
de
champlain
that
incomparable
old
woodsman
and
lover
of
the
wilderness
ferdinand
larouche
is
our
chef
there
must
be
a
head
in
every
party
for
the
sake
of
harmony
and
his
assistant
is
his
brother
francois
ferdinand
is
a
stocky
little
fellow
a
sawed
off
man
not
more
than
five
feet
two
inches
tall
but
every
inch
of
him
is
pure
vim
he
can
carry
a
big
canoe
or
a
of
camp
stuff
over
a
mile
portage
without
stopping
to
take
breath
he
is
a
capital
with
prudence
enough
to
balance
his
courage
and
a
fair
cook
with
plenty
of
that
quality
which
is
wanting
in
the
ordinary
cook
of
commerce
good
humour
always
joking
whistling
singing
he
brings
the
atmosphere
of
a
perpetual
holiday
along
with
him
his
coat
covers
a
heart
full
of
music
he
has
two
talents
which
make
him
a
marked
man
among
his
comrades
he
plays
the
fiddle
to
the
delight
of
all
the
balls
and
weddings
through
the
and
he
speaks
english
to
the
admiration
and
envy
of
the
other
guides
but
like
all
men
of
genius
he
is
modest
about
his
accomplishments
not
spik
good
for
camp
fishin

the
aspirates
puzzle
him
he
can
get
though
a
slash
of
fallen
timber
more
easily
than
a
sentence
full
of
this
and
that
sometimes
he
expresses
his
meaning
queerly
he
was
telling
me
once
about
his
farm
not
far
off
here
in
dhe
riviere
au
cochon
river
of
dhe
pig
you
call
am
a
widow
got
five
sons
of
dhem
are
girls
but
he
usually
ends
by
falling
back
into
french
which
he
assures
you
you
speak
to
perfection
much
better
than
the
canadians
the
french
of
paris
in
short
has
been
in
paris
such
courtesy
is
born
in
the
blood
and
is
irresistible
you
can
not
help
returning
the
compliment
and
assuring
him
that
his
english
is
remarkable
good
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
better
than
any
of
the
other
guides
can
speak
and
so
it
is
francois
is
a
little
taller
a
little
thinner
and
considerably
quieter
than
ferdinand
he
laughs
loyally
at
his
brother
jokes
and
sings
the
response
to
his
songs
and
wields
a
good
second
paddle
in
the
canoe
jean
commonly
called
johnny
morel
is
a
tall
strong
man
of
fifty
with
a
bushy
red
beard
that
would
do
credit
to
a
pirate
but
when
you
look
at
him
more
closely
you
see
that
he
has
a
clear
kind
blue
eye
and
a
most
honest
friendly
face
under
his
slouch
hat
he
has
travelled
these
woods
and
waters
for
thirty
years
so
that
he
knows
the
way
through
them
by
a
thousand
familiar
signs
as
well
as
you
know
the
streets
of
the
city
he
is
our
pathfinder
the
bow
paddle
in
his
canoe
is
held
by
his
son
joseph
a
lad
not
quite
fifteen
but
already
as
tall
and
almost
as
strong
as
a
man
he
is
yet
of
the
youth
said
johnny
and
he
knows
not
the
affairs
of
the
camp
this
trip
is
for
him
the
first
it
is
his
school
but
i
hope
he
will
content
you
he
is
good
and
of
the
strongest
for
his
age
i
have
educated
already
two
sons
in
the
bow
of
my
canoe
the
oldest
has
gone
to
pennsylvanie
he
peels
the
bark
there
for
the
tanning
of
leather
the
second
had
the
misfortune
of
breaking
his
leg
so
that
he
can
no
longer
kneel
to
paddle
he
has
descended
to
the
making
of
shoes
joseph
is
my
third
pupil
and
i
have
still
a
younger
one
at
home
waiting
to
come
into
my
school
a
touch
of
family
life
like
that
is
always
refreshing
and
doubly
so
in
the
wilderness
for
what
is
fatherhood
at
its
best
everywhere
but
the
training
of
good
men
to
take
the
teacher
place
when
his
work
is
done
some
day
when
johnny
rheumatism
has
made
his
joints
a
little
stiffer
and
his
eyes
have
lost
something
of
their
keenness
he
will
be
wielding
the
second
paddle
in
the
boat
and
going
out
only
on
the
short
and
easy
trips
it
will
be
young
joseph
that
steers
the
canoe
through
the
dangerous
places
and
carries
the
heaviest
load
over
the
portages
and
leads
the
way
on
the
long
journeys
it
has
taken
me
longer
to
describe
our
men
than
it
took
them
to
prepare
our
frugal
meal
a
pot
of
tea
the
woodsman
favourite
drink
i
never
knew
a
good
guide
that
would
not
go
without
whisky
rather
than
without
tea
a
few
slices
of
toast
and
juicy
rashers
of
bacon
a
kettle
of
boiled
potatoes
and
a
relish
of
crackers
and
cheese
we
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
for
an
afternoon
fishing
three
or
four
miles
down
the
river
at
the
ile
maligne
the
island
is
well
named
for
it
is
the
most
perilous
place
on
the
river
and
has
a
record
of
disaster
and
death
the
scattered
waters
of
the
discharge
are
drawn
together
here
into
one
deep
narrow
powerful
stream
flowing
between
gloomy
shores
of
granite
in
the
wicked
island
shows
its
scarred
and
bristling
head
like
a
giant
ready
to
dispute
the
passage
the
river
rushes
straight
at
the
rocky
brow
splits
into
two
currents
and
raves
away
on
both
sides
of
the
island
in
a
double
chain
of
furious
falls
and
rapids
in
these
wild
waters
we
fished
with
immense
delight
and
fair
success
scrambling
down
among
the
huge
rocks
along
the
shore
and
joining
the
excitement
of
an
alpine
climb
with
the
placid
pleasures
of
angling
at
nightfall
we
were
at
home
again
in
our
camp
with
half
a
score
of
onananiche
weighing
from
one
to
four
pounds
each
our
next
day
journey
was
long
and
variegated
a
portage
of
a
mile
or
two
across
the
ile
with
a
cart
to
haul
our
canoes
and
stuff
brought
us
to
the
little
discharge
down
which
we
floated
for
a
little
way
and
then
hauled
through
the
village
of
joseph
to
the
foot
of
the
carcajou
or
wildcat
falls
a
mile
of
quick
water
was
soon
passed
and
we
came
to
the
junction
of
the
little
discharge
with
the
grand
discharge
at
the
point
where
the
picturesque
stands
in
a
grove
of
birches
beside
the
big
vache
caille
falls
it
is
lively
work
crossing
the
pool
here
when
the
water
is
high
and
the
canoes
are
heavy
but
we
went
through
the
labouring
seas
safely
and
landed
some
distance
below
at
the
head
of
the
rapide
gervais
to
eat
our
lunch
the
water
was
too
rough
to
run
down
with
loaded
boats
so
damon
and
i
had
to
walk
about
three
miles
along
the
while
the
men
went
down
with
the
canoes
on
our
way
beside
the
rapids
damon
geologised
finding
the
marks
of
ancient
glaciers
and
bits
of
and
pockets
of
sand
full
of
infinitesimal
garnets
and
specks
of
gold
washed
from
the
primitive
granite
and
i
fished
picking
up
a
pair
of
ouananiche
in
nooks
among
the
rocks
the
swift
water
was
almost
passed
when
we
embarked
again
and
ran
down
the
last
slope
into
a
long
deadwater
the
shores
at
first
bold
and
rough
covered
with
dense
thickets
of
timber
now
became
smoother
and
more
fertile
scattered
farms
with
square
unpainted
houses
and
long
thatched
barns
began
to
creep
over
the
hills
toward
the
river
there
was
a
hamlet
called
charles
with
a
rude
little
church
and
a
campanile
of
logs
the
cure
robed
in
decent
black
and
wearing
a
tall
silk
hat
of
the
vintage
of
sat
on
the
veranda
of
his
trim
presbytery
looking
down
upon
us
like
an
image
of
propriety
smiling
at
bohemianism
other
craft
appeared
on
the
river
a
man
and
his
wife
paddling
an
old
dugout
with
half
a
dozen
children
packed
in
amidships
a
crew
of
lumbermen
in
a
bateau
picking
up
stray
logs
along
the
banks
a
couple
of
boatloads
of
young
people
returning
merrily
from
a
holiday
visit
a
party
of
in
a
skiff
all
the
life
of
the
was
in
evidence
on
the
river
we
felt
quite
as
if
we
had
been
in
the
swim
of
society
when
at
length
we
reached
the
point
where
the
riviere
des
aunes
came
tumbling
down
a
ladder
of
broken
black
rocks
there
we
pitched
our
tents
in
a
strip
of
meadow
by
the
where
we
could
have
the
sound
of
the
falls
for
a
all
night
and
the
whole
river
for
a
bath
at
sunrise
a
sparkling
draught
of
crystal
weather
was
poured
into
our
in
the
morning
as
we
set
out
for
a
drive
of
fifteen
miles
across
country
to
the
riviere
a
a
tributary
of
the
crooked
unnavigable
river
of
alders
the
canoes
and
luggage
were
loaded
on
a
couple
of
charrettes
or
carts
but
for
us
and
the
guides
there
were
two
the
typical
vehicles
of
the
century
as
characteristic
of
canada
as
the
carriole
is
of
norway
it
is
a
buckboard
drawn
by
one
horse
and
the
back
seat
is
covered
with
a
hood
like
an
poke
bonnet
the
road
is
of
clay
and
always
rutty
it
runs
level
for
a
while
and
then
jumps
up
a
steep
ridge
and
down
again
or
into
a
deep
gully
and
out
again
the
habitant
idea
of
good
driving
is
to
let
his
horse
slide
down
the
hill
and
gallop
up
this
imparts
a
spasmodic
quality
to
the
motion
like
carlyle
style
the
native
houses
are
strung
along
the
road
the
modern
pattern
has
a
convex
angle
in
the
roof
and
it
is
a
rustic
adaptation
of
the
mansard
the
antique
pattern
which
is
far
more
picturesque
has
a
concave
curve
in
the
roof
and
the
eaves
project
like
eyebrows
shading
the
flatness
of
the
face
paint
is
a
rarity
the
prevailing
colour
is
the
soft
gray
of
wood
sometimes
in
the
better
class
of
houses
a
gallery
is
built
across
the
front
and
around
one
side
and
a
square
of
garden
is
fenced
in
with
dahlias
and
hollyhocks
and
marigolds
and
perhaps
a
struggling
rosebush
and
usually
a
small
patch
of
tobacco
growing
in
one
corner
once
in
a
long
while
you
may
see
a
tree
or
a
clump
of
sapling
poplars
planted
near
the
door
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
the
farmer
had
left
a
few
of
the
noble
to
shade
his
house
but
then
when
the
farmer
came
into
the
wilderness
he
was
not
a
farmer
he
was
first
of
all
a
he
regarded
the
forest
as
a
stubborn
enemy
in
possession
of
his
land
he
attacked
it
with
fire
and
axe
and
exterminated
it
instead
of
keeping
a
few
captives
to
hold
their
green
umbrellas
over
his
head
when
at
last
his
grain
fields
should
be
smiling
around
him
and
he
should
sit
down
on
his
doorstep
to
smoke
a
pipe
of
tobacco
in
the
time
of
adversity
one
should
prepare
for
prosperity
i
fancy
there
are
a
good
many
people
unconsciously
repeating
the
mistake
of
the
canadian
farmer
chopping
down
all
the
native
growths
of
life
clearing
the
ground
of
all
the
useless
pretty
things
that
seem
to
cumber
it
sacrificing
everything
to
utility
and
success
we
fell
the
last
green
tree
for
the
sake
of
raising
an
extra
hill
of
potatoes
and
never
stop
to
think
what
an
ugly
barren
place
we
may
have
to
sit
in
while
we
eat
them
the
ideals
the
attachments
yes
even
the
dreams
of
youth
are
worth
saving
for
the
artificial
tastes
with
which
age
tries
to
make
good
their
loss
grow
very
slowly
and
cast
but
a
slender
shade
most
of
the
canadian
farmhouses
have
their
ovens
we
saw
them
everywhere
rounded
edifices
of
clay
raised
on
a
foundation
of
logs
and
usually
covered
with
a
pointed
roof
of
boards
they
looked
like
little
family
chapels
and
so
they
were
shrines
where
the
ritual
of
the
good
housewife
was
celebrated
and
the
gift
of
daily
bread
having
been
honestly
earned
was
thankfully
received
at
one
house
we
noticed
a
curious
fragment
of
domestic
economy
half
a
pig
was
suspended
over
the
chimney
and
the
smoke
of
the
summer
fire
was
turned
to
account
in
curing
the
winter
meat
i
guess
the
children
of
that
family
had
a
peculiar
fondness
for
the
parental
we
saw
them
making
in
the
road
and
imagined
that
they
looked
lovingly
up
at
the
pendent
porker
outlined
against
the
sky
a
sign
of
promise
prophetic
of
bacon
about
noon
the
road
passed
beyond
the
region
of
habitation
into
a
barren
land
where
blueberries
were
the
only
crop
and
partridges
took
the
place
of
chickens
through
this
rolling
gravelly
plain
sparsely
wooded
and
glowing
with
the
tall
magenta
bloom
of
the
fireweed
we
drove
toward
the
mountains
until
the
road
went
to
seed
and
we
could
follow
it
no
longer
then
we
took
to
the
water
and
began
to
pole
our
canoes
up
the
river
of
the
bear
it
was
a
clear
stream
not
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
yards
wide
running
swift
and
strong
over
beds
of
sand
and
rounded
pebbles
the
canoes
went
wallowing
and
plunging
up
the
narrow
channel
between
thick
banks
of
alders
like
clumsy
all
the
grace
with
which
they
move
under
the
strokes
of
the
paddle
in
large
waters
was
gone
they
looked
uncouth
and
predatory
like
a
pair
of
seals
that
i
once
saw
swimming
far
up
the
river
ristigouche
in
chase
of
fish
from
the
bow
of
each
canoe
the
stuck
out
as
a
symbol
of
destruction
after
the
fashion
of
the
dutch
admiral
who
nailed
a
broom
to
his
masthead
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
sweep
the
trout
out
of
that
little
river
by
any
fair
method
of
angling
for
there
were
millions
of
them
not
large
but
lively
and
brilliant
and
fat
they
leaped
in
every
bend
of
the
stream
we
trailed
our
flies
and
made
quick
casts
here
and
there
as
we
went
along
it
was
fishing
on
the
wing
and
when
we
pitched
our
tents
in
a
hurry
at
nightfall
on
the
low
shore
of
lac
sale
among
the
bushes
where
firewood
was
scarce
and
there
were
no
sapins
for
the
beds
we
were
comforted
for
the
poorness
of
the
by
the
excellence
of
the
trout
supper
it
was
a
bitter
cold
night
for
august
there
was
a
skin
of
ice
on
the
at
daybreak
we
were
glad
to
be
up
and
away
for
an
early
start
the
river
grew
wilder
and
more
difficult
there
were
rapids
and
ruined
dams
built
by
the
lumbermen
years
ago
at
these
places
the
trout
were
larger
and
so
plentiful
that
it
was
easy
to
hook
two
at
a
cast
it
came
on
to
rain
furiously
while
we
were
eating
our
lunch
but
we
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
any
more
than
the
fish
did
here
and
there
the
river
was
completely
blocked
by
fallen
trees
the
guides
called
it
bouchee
corked
and
leaped
out
gayly
into
the
water
with
their
axes
to
uncork
it
we
passed
through
some
pretty
lakes
unknown
to
the
and
arrived
before
sundown
at
the
lake
of
the
bear
where
we
were
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
the
lake
was
full
of
floating
logs
and
the
water
raised
by
the
heavy
rains
and
the
operations
of
the
lumbermen
was
several
feet
above
its
usual
level
were
all
blotted
out
and
we
had
to
explore
halfway
around
the
shore
before
we
could
get
out
comfortably
we
raised
the
tents
on
a
small
shoulder
of
a
hill
a
few
rods
above
the
water
and
a
glorious
of
birch
logs
soon
made
us
forget
our
misery
as
though
it
had
not
been
the
name
of
the
lake
of
the
beautiful
trout
made
us
desire
to
visit
it
the
portage
was
said
to
be
only
fifty
acres
long
the
arpent
is
the
popular
measure
of
distance
here
but
it
passed
over
a
ridge
of
newly
burned
land
and
was
so
entangled
with
ruined
woods
and
desolate
of
birds
and
flowers
that
it
seemed
to
us
at
least
five
miles
the
lake
was
charming
a
sheet
of
singularly
clear
water
of
a
pale
green
tinge
surrounded
by
wooded
hills
in
the
translucent
depths
trout
and
pike
live
together
but
whether
in
peace
or
not
i
can
not
tell
both
of
them
grow
to
an
enormous
size
but
the
pike
are
larger
and
have
more
capacious
jaws
one
of
them
broke
my
tackle
and
went
off
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
as
if
he
had
been
born
to
it
of
course
the
guides
vowed
that
they
saw
him
as
he
passed
under
the
canoe
and
declared
that
he
must
weigh
thirty
or
forty
pounds
the
spectacles
of
regret
always
magnify
the
trout
were
coy
we
took
only
five
of
them
perfect
specimens
of
the
true
salvelinus
fontinalis
with
square
tails
and
carmine
spots
on
their
dark
mottled
sides
the
largest
weighed
three
pounds
and
and
the
others
were
almost
as
heavy
on
our
way
back
to
the
camp
we
found
the
portage
beset
by
innumerable
and
bloodthirsty
foes
there
are
four
grades
of
insect
malignity
in
the
woods
the
mildest
is
represented
by
the
winged
idiot
that
john
burroughs
little
boy
called
a
blunderhead
he
dances
stupidly
before
your
face
as
if
lost
in
admiration
and
finishes
his
pointless
tale
by
getting
in
your
eye
or
down
your
throat
the
next
grade
is
represented
by
the
midges
bite
no
see
is
the
indian
name
for
these
invisible
atoms
of
animated
pepper
which
settle
upon
you
in
the
twilight
and
make
your
skin
burn
like
fire
but
their
hour
is
brief
and
when
they
depart
they
leave
not
a
bump
behind
one
step
lower
in
the
scale
we
find
the
mosquito
or
rather
he
finds
us
and
makes
his
poisoned
mark
upon
our
skin
but
after
all
he
has
his
good
qualities
the
mosquito
is
a
gentlemanly
pirate
he
carries
his
weapon
openly
and
gives
notice
of
an
attack
he
respects
the
decencies
of
life
and
does
not
strike
below
the
belt
or
creep
down
the
back
of
your
neck
but
the
black
fly
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
moral
scale
he
is
an
unmitigated
ruffian
the
of
the
woods
he
looks
like
a
tiny
immature
with
white
legs
as
if
he
must
be
innocent
but
in
fact
he
crawls
like
a
serpent
and
bites
like
a
dog
no
portion
of
the
human
frame
is
sacred
from
his
greed
he
takes
his
pound
of
flesh
anywhere
and
does
not
scruple
to
take
the
blood
with
it
as
a
rule
you
can
defend
yourself
to
some
degree
against
him
by
wearing
a
tying
your
sleeves
around
your
wrists
and
your
trousers
around
your
ankles
and
anointing
yourself
with
grease
flavoured
with
pennyroyal
for
which
cleanly
and
honest
scent
he
has
a
coarse
aversion
but
sometimes
especially
on
burned
land
about
the
middle
of
a
warm
afternoon
when
a
rain
is
threatening
the
horde
of
black
flies
descend
in
force
and
fury
knowing
that
their
time
is
short
then
there
is
no
escape
suits
of
chain
armour
nubian
ointments
of
potency
would
not
save
you
you
must
do
as
our
guides
did
on
the
portage
submit
to
fate
and
walk
along
in
heroic
silence
like
marco
bozzaris
bleeding
at
every
pore
or
do
as
damon
and
i
did
break
into
ejaculations
and
a
run
until
you
reach
a
place
where
you
can
light
a
smudge
and
hold
your
head
over
it
and
yet
said
my
comrade
as
we
sat
coughing
and
rubbing
our
eyes
in
the
painful
shelter
of
the
smoke
there
are
worse
trials
than
this
in
the
civilised
districts
social
enmities
and
newspaper
scandals
and
religious
persecutions
the
blackest
fly
i
ever
saw
is
the
reverend
but
here
his
voice
was
fortunately
choked
by
a
fit
of
coughing
a
couple
of
wandering
indians
descendants
of
the
montagnais
on
whose
hunting
domain
we
were
travelling
dropped
in
at
our
camp
that
night
as
we
sat
around
the
fire
they
gave
us
the
latest
news
about
the
portages
on
our
further
journey
how
far
they
had
been
blocked
with
fallen
trees
and
whether
the
water
was
high
or
low
in
the
rivers
just
as
a
visitor
at
home
would
talk
about
the
effect
of
the
strikes
on
the
stock
market
and
the
prospects
of
the
newest
organization
of
the
classes
for
the
overthrow
of
tammany
hall
every
phase
of
civilisation
or
barbarism
creates
its
own
conversational
currency
the
weather
like
the
old
spanish
dollar
is
the
only
coin
that
passes
everywhere
but
our
indians
did
not
carry
much
small
change
about
them
they
were
dark
silent
chaps
soon
talked
out
and
then
they
sat
sucking
their
pipes
before
the
fire
as
dumb
as
their
own
wooden
effigies
in
front
of
a
tobacconist
shop
until
the
spirit
moved
them
and
they
vanished
in
their
canoe
down
the
dark
lake
our
own
guides
were
very
different
they
were
as
full
of
conversation
as
a
is
of
gum
when
all
shallower
themes
were
exhausted
they
would
discourse
of
bears
and
canoes
and
lumber
and
fish
forever
after
damon
and
i
had
left
the
fire
and
rolled
ourselves
in
the
blankets
in
our
own
tent
we
could
hear
the
men
going
on
and
on
with
their
simple
jests
and
endless
tales
of
adventure
until
sleep
drowned
their
voices
it
was
the
sound
of
a
french
chanson
that
woke
us
early
on
the
morning
of
our
departure
from
the
lake
of
the
bear
a
gang
of
lumbermen
were
bringing
a
lot
of
logs
through
the
lake
in
the
cold
gray
mist
that
usually
betokens
a
fine
day
and
wet
to
the
waist
from
splashing
about
after
their
unwieldy
flock
these
rough
fellows
were
singing
at
their
work
as
cheerfully
as
a
party
of
robins
in
a
at
sunrise
it
was
like
the
miller
and
the
two
girls
whom
wordsworth
saw
dancing
in
their
boats
on
the
thames
they
dance
not
for
me
yet
mine
is
their
glee
thus
pleasure
is
spread
through
the
earth
in
stray
gifts
to
be
claimed
by
whoever
shall
find
thus
a
rich
redundantly
kind
moves
all
nature
to
gladness
and
mirth
but
our
later
thoughts
of
the
lumbermen
were
not
altogether
grateful
when
we
arrived
that
day
after
a
mile
of
portage
at
the
little
riviere
blanche
upon
which
we
had
counted
to
float
us
down
to
lac
tchitagama
and
found
that
they
had
stolen
all
its
water
to
float
their
logs
down
the
lake
of
the
bear
the
poor
little
river
was
as
dry
as
a
theological
novel
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
except
the
bed
and
the
bones
it
was
like
a
connecticut
stream
in
the
middle
of
august
all
its
pretty
secrets
were
laid
bare
all
its
music
was
hushed
the
pools
that
lingered
among
the
rocks
seemed
like
big
tears
and
the
voice
of
the
forlorn
rivulets
that
trickled
in
here
and
there
seeking
the
parent
stream
was
a
voice
of
weeping
and
complaint
for
us
the
loss
meant
a
hard
day
work
scrambling
over
slippery
stones
and
splashing
through
puddles
and
forcing
a
way
through
the
tangled
thickets
on
the
bank
instead
of
a
pleasant
two
hours
run
on
a
swift
current
we
ate
our
dinner
on
a
sandbank
in
what
was
once
the
middle
of
a
pretty
pond
and
entered
as
the
sun
was
sinking
a
narrow
wooded
gorge
between
the
hills
completely
filled
by
a
chain
of
small
lakes
where
travelling
became
easy
and
pleasant
the
steep
shores
clothed
with
cedar
and
black
spruce
and
rose
sheer
from
the
water
the
passage
from
lake
to
lake
was
a
tiny
rapid
a
few
yards
long
gurgling
through
mossy
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
chain
there
was
a
longer
rapid
with
a
portage
beside
it
we
emerged
from
the
dense
bush
suddenly
and
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
lake
tchitagama
how
the
heart
expands
at
such
a
view
nine
miles
of
shining
water
lay
stretched
before
us
opening
through
the
mountains
that
guarded
it
on
both
sides
with
lofty
walls
of
green
and
gray
ridge
over
ridge
point
beyond
point
until
the
vista
ended
in
you
orange
sunset
waning
slow
at
a
moment
like
this
one
feels
a
sense
of
exultation
it
is
a
new
discovery
of
the
joy
of
living
and
yet
my
friend
and
i
confessed
to
each
other
there
was
a
tinge
of
sadness
an
inexplicable
regret
mingled
with
our
joy
was
it
the
thought
of
how
few
human
eyes
had
even
seen
that
lovely
vision
was
it
the
dim
foreboding
that
we
might
never
see
it
again
who
can
explain
the
secret
pathos
of
nature
loveliness
it
is
a
touch
of
melancholy
inherited
from
our
mother
eve
it
is
an
unconscious
memory
of
the
lost
paradise
it
is
the
sense
that
even
if
we
should
find
another
eden
we
would
not
be
fit
to
enjoy
it
perfectly
nor
stay
in
it
forever
our
first
camp
on
tchitagama
was
at
the
sunrise
end
of
the
lake
in
a
bay
paved
with
small
round
stones
laid
close
together
and
beaten
firmly
down
by
the
waves
there
and
along
the
shores
below
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
that
foamed
in
over
a
ledge
of
granite
and
in
the
shadow
of
cliffs
of
limestone
and
feldspar
we
trolled
and
took
many
fish
pike
of
enormous
size
sharks
devourers
of
nobler
game
fit
only
to
kill
and
throw
away
huge
old
trout
of
six
or
seven
pounds
with
broad
tails
and
hooked
jaws
fine
fighters
and
poor
food
stupid
chub
ouitouche
the
indians
call
them
biting
at
hooks
that
were
not
baited
for
them
and
best
of
all
onananiche
pleasant
to
capture
and
delicate
to
eat
our
second
camp
was
on
a
sandy
point
at
the
sunset
end
of
the
lake
a
fine
place
for
bathing
and
convenient
to
the
wild
meadows
and
blueberry
patches
where
damon
went
to
hunt
for
bears
he
did
not
find
any
but
once
he
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
bushes
which
he
thought
was
a
bear
and
he
declared
that
he
got
quite
as
much
excitement
out
of
it
as
if
it
had
had
four
legs
and
a
mouthful
of
teeth
he
brought
back
from
one
of
his
expeditions
an
indian
letter
which
he
had
found
in
a
cleft
stick
by
the
river
it
was
a
sheet
of
with
a
picture
drawn
on
it
in
charcoal
five
indians
in
a
canoe
paddling
up
the
river
and
one
in
another
canoe
pointing
in
another
direction
we
read
it
as
a
message
left
by
a
hunting
party
telling
their
companions
not
to
go
on
up
the
river
because
it
was
already
occupied
but
to
turn
off
on
a
side
stream
there
was
a
sign
of
a
different
kind
nailed
to
an
old
stump
behind
our
camp
it
was
the
top
of
a
with
an
inscription
after
this
fashion

lbs
there
was
a
combination
of
piscatorial
pride
and
mercantile
enterprise
in
this
quaint
device
that
took
our
fancy
it
suggested
also
a
curious
question
of
psychology
in
regard
to
the
inhibitory
influence
of
horses
and
fish
upon
the
human
nerve
of
veracity
we
named
the
place
point
ananias
and
yet
in
fact
it
was
a
wild
and
lonely
spot
and
not
even
the
hebrew
inscription
could
spoil
the
sense
of
solitude
that
surrounded
us
when
the
night
came
and
the
storm
howled
across
the
take
and
the
darkness
encircled
us
with
a
wall
that
only
seemed
the
more
dense
and
impenetrable
as
the
firelight
blazed
and
leaped
within
the
black
ring
how
far
away
is
the
nearest
house
johnny
i
do
know
fifty
miles
i
suppose
and
what
would
you
do
if
the
canoes
were
burned
or
if
a
tree
fell
and
smashed
them
well
i
say
a
pater
noster
and
take
bread
and
bacon
enough
for
four
days
and
an
axe
and
plenty
of
matches
and
make
a
straight
line
through
the
woods
but
it
would
be
a
joke
i
can
tell
you
the
river
peribonca
into
which
lake
tchitagama
flows
without
a
break
is
the
noblest
of
all
the
streams
that
empty
into
lake
john
it
is
said
to
be
more
than
three
hundred
miles
long
and
at
the
mouth
of
the
lake
it
is
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
wide
flowing
with
a
deep
still
current
through
the
forest
the
lasted
for
several
miles
then
the
river
sloped
into
a
rapid
spread
through
a
net
of
islands
and
broke
over
a
ledge
in
a
cataract
another
quiet
stretch
was
followed
by
another
fall
and
so
on
along
the
whole
course
of
the
river
we
passed
three
of
these
falls
in
the
first
day
voyage
by
portages
so
steep
and
rough
that
an
adirondack
guide
would
have
turned
gray
at
the
sight
of
them
and
camped
at
night
just
below
the
chute
du
diable
where
we
found
some
ouananiche
in
the
foam
our
tents
were
on
an
islet
and
all
around
we
saw
the
primeval
savage
beauty
of
a
world
unmarred
by
man
the
river
leaped
shouting
down
its
double
stairway
of
granite
rejoicing
like
a
strong
man
to
run
a
race
the
in
the
western
sky
deepened
from
saffron
to
violet
among
the
tops
of
the
cedars
and
over
the
cliffs
rose
the
moonlight
paling
the
heavens
but
glorifying
the
earth
there
was
something
large
and
generous
and
untrammelled
in
the
scene
recalling
one
of
walt
whitman
rhapsodies
earth
of
departed
sunsets
earth
of
the
mountains
earth
of
the
vitreous
pour
of
the
full
moon
just
tinged
with
blue
earth
of
shine
and
dark
mottling
the
tide
of
the
river
all
the
next
day
we
went
down
with
the
current
regiments
of
black
spruce
stood
in
endless
files
like
grenadiers
each
tree
capped
with
a
thick
tuft
of
matted
cones
and
branches
tall
white
birches
leaned
out
over
the
stream
as
if
to
see
their
own
beauty
in
the
moving
mirror
there
were
touches
of
colour
on
the
banks
the
ragged
pink
flowers
of
the
which
always
reminds
me
of
a
happy
tramp
and
the
yellow
of
the
and
the
intense
blue
of
the
closed
gentian
that
strange
flower
which
like
a
reticent
heart
never
opens
to
the
light
sometimes
the
river
spread
out
like
a
lake
between
high
bluffs
of
sand
fully
a
mile
apart
and
again
it
divided
into
many
channels
winding
cunningly
down
among
the
islands
as
if
it
were
resolved
to
slip
around
the
next
barrier
of
rock
without
a
fall
there
were
eight
of
these
huge
natural
dams
in
the
course
of
that
day
journey
sometimes
we
followed
one
of
the
side
canals
and
made
the
portage
at
a
distance
from
the
main
cataract
and
sometimes
we
ran
with
the
central
current
to
the
very
brink
of
the
chute
darting
aside
just
in
time
to
escape
going
over
at
the
foot
of
the
last
fall
we
made
our
camp
on
a
curving
beach
of
sand
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
fishing
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
closely
the
guides
could
guess
at
the
weight
of
the
fish
by
looking
at
them
the
ouananiche
are
much
longer
in
proportion
to
their
weight
than
trout
and
a
novice
almost
always
overestimates
them
but
the
guides
were
not
deceived
this
one
will
weigh
four
pounds
and
and
this
one
four
pounds
but
that
one
not
more
than
three
pounds
he
is
meagre
but
he
is
meagre
when
we
went
ashore
and
tried
the
spring
balance
which
every
angler
ought
to
carry
with
him
as
an
aid
to
his
conscience
the
guides
guess
usually
proved
to
be
within
an
ounce
or
two
of
the
fact
any
one
of
the
senses
can
be
educated
to
do
the
work
of
the
others
the
eyes
of
these
experienced
fishermen
were
as
sensitive
to
weight
as
if
they
had
been
made
to
use
as
scales
below
the
last
fall
the
peribonca
flows
for
a
score
of
miles
with
an
unbroken
stream
through
low
shores
of
forest
and
bush
and
meadow
near
its
mouth
the
little
peribonca
joins
it
and
the
immense
flood
nearly
two
miles
wide
pours
into
lake
john
here
we
saw
the
first
outpost
of
civilisation
a
huge
unpainted
storehouse
where
supplies
are
kept
for
the
lumbermen
and
the
new
settlers
here
also
we
found
the
tiny
lame
steam
launch
that
was
to
carry
us
back
to
the
hotel
roberval
our
canoes
were
stowed
upon
the
roof
of
the
cabin
and
we
embarked
for
the
last
stage
of
our
long
journey
as
we
came
out
of
the
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
was
invisible
and
a
stiff
was
rolling
big
waves
across
the
bar
it
was
like
putting
out
into
the
open
sea
the
launch
laboured
and
puffed
along
for
four
or
five
miles
growing
more
and
more
asthmatic
with
every
breath
then
there
was
an
explosion
in
the
some
necessary
part
of
the
intestinal
machinery
had
blown
out
there
was
a
moment
of
confusion
the
captain
hurried
to
drop
the
anchor
and
the
narrow
craft
lay
rolling
in
the
billows
what
to
do
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
like
a
frenchman
wait
here
i
suppose
but
how
long
who
knows
perhaps
till
perhaps
the
day
after
they
will
send
another
boat
to
look
for
us
in
the
course
of
time
but
the
quarters
were
cramped
the
weather
looked
ugly
if
the
wind
should
rise
the
cranky
launch
would
not
be
a
safe
cradle
for
the
night
damon
and
i
preferred
the
canoes
for
they
at
least
would
float
if
they
were
capsized
so
we
stepped
into
the
frail
buoyant
shells
of
bark
once
more
and
danced
over
the
big
waves
toward
the
shore
we
made
a
camp
on
a
point
of
sand
and
felt
like
shipwrecked
mariners
but
it
was
a
shipwreck
for
our
larder
was
still
full
and
as
if
to
provide
us
with
the
luxuries
as
well
as
the
necessities
of
life
nature
had
spread
an
inexhaustible
dessert
of
the
largest
and
most
luscious
blueberries
around
our
tents
after
supper
strolling
along
the
beach
we
debated
the
best
way
of
escape
whether
to
send
one
of
our
canoes
around
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
that
night
to
meet
the
steamer
at
the
island
house
and
bring
it
to
our
rescue
or
to
set
out
the
next
morning
and
paddle
both
canoes
around
the
western
end
of
the
lake
thirty
miles
to
the
hotel
roberval
while
we
were
talking
we
came
to
a
dry
old
with
ragged
curling
bark
here
is
a
torch
cried
damon
to
throw
light
upon
the
situation
he
touched
a
match
to
it
and
the
flames
flashed
up
the
tall
trunk
until
it
was
transformed
into
a
pillar
of
fire
but
the
sudden
illumination
burned
out
and
our
counsels
were
wrapt
again
in
darkness
and
uncertainty
when
there
came
a
great
uproar
of
from
the
lake
they
must
be
signalling
for
us
what
could
it
mean
we
fired
our
guns
leaped
into
a
canoe
leaving
two
of
the
guides
to
break
camp
and
paddled
out
swiftly
into
the
night
it
seemed
an
endless
distance
before
we
found
the
feeble
light
where
the
crippled
launch
was
tossing
at
anchor
the
captain
shouted
something
about
a
larger
steamboat
and
a
raft
of
logs
out
in
the
lake
a
mile
or
two
beyond
presently
we
saw
the
lights
and
the
orange
glow
of
the
cabin
windows
was
she
coming
or
going
or
standing
still
we
paddled
on
as
fast
as
we
could
shouting
and
firing
off
a
revolver
until
we
had
no
more
cartridges
we
were
resolved
not
to
let
that
mysterious
vessel
escape
us
and
threw
ourselves
with
energy
into
the
novel
excitement
of
chasing
a
steamboat
in
the
dark
then
the
lights
began
to
swing
around
the
throbbing
of
grew
louder
and
louder
she
was
evidently
coming
straight
toward
us
at
that
moment
it
flashed
upon
us
that
while
she
had
plenty
of
lights
we
had
none
we
were
lying
invisible
right
across
her
track
the
character
of
the
steamboat
chase
was
reversed
we
turned
and
fled
as
the
guides
say
a
quatre
pattes
into
illimitable
space
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
our
too
powerful
friend
it
makes
considerable
difference
in
the
voyage
of
life
whether
you
chase
the
steamboat
or
the
steamboat
chases
you
meantime
our
other
canoe
had
approached
unseen
the
steamer
passed
safely
between
the
two
boats
slackening
speed
as
the
pilot
caught
our
loud
halloo
she
loomed
up
above
us
like
a
and
as
we
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
we
felt
that
we
had
indeed
gotten
out
of
the
wilderness
my
old
friend
captain
savard
made
us
welcome
he
had
been
sent
out
much
to
his
disgust
to
catch
a
runaway
boom
of
logs
and
tow
it
back
to
roberval
it
would
be
an
all
night
affair
but
we
must
take
possession
of
his
stateroom
and
make
ourselves
comfortable
he
would
certainly
bring
us
to
the
hotel
in
time
for
breakfast
so
he
went
off
on
the
upper
deck
and
we
heard
him
stamping
about
and
yelling
to
his
crew
as
they
struggled
to
get
their
unwieldy
drove
of
six
thousand
logs
in
motion
all
night
long
we
assisted
at
the
lumbermen
difficult
enterprise
we
heard
the
steamer
snorting
and
straining
at
her
clumsy
stubborn
convoy
the
hoarse
shouts
of
the
crew
disguised
in
a
mongrel
dialect
which
made
them
perhaps
fortunately
less
intelligible
and
more
forcible
mingled
with
our
broken
dreams
but
it
was
in
fact
a
fitting
close
of
our
voyage
for
what
were
we
doing
it
was
the
last
stage
of
the
woodman
labour
it
was
the
gathering
of
a
wild
herd
of
the
houses
and
churches
and
ships
and
bridges
that
grow
in
the
forests
and
bringing
them
into
the
fold
of
human
service
i
wonder
how
often
the
inhabitant
of
the
snug
queen
anne
cottage
in
the
suburbs
remembers
the
picturesque
toil
and
varied
hardship
that
it
has
cost
to
hew
and
drag
his
walls
and
floors
and
pretty
peaked
roofs
out
of
the
backwoods
it
might
enlarge
his
home
and
make
his
musings
by
the
winter
fireside
less
commonplace
to
give
a
kindly
thought
now
and
then
to
the
long
chain
of
human
workers
through
whose
hands
the
timber
of
his
house
has
passed
since
it
first
felt
the
stroke
of
the
axe
in
the
winter
woods
and
floated
through
the
spring
and
summer
on
lakes
and
little
rivers
au
large
in
the
traun
those
who
wish
to
forget
painful
thoughts
do
well
to
absent
themselves
for
a
time
from
the
ties
and
objects
that
recall
them
but
we
can
be
said
only
to
fulfil
our
destiny
in
the
place
that
gave
us
birth
i
should
on
this
account
like
well
enough
to
spend
the
whole
of
my
life
in
travelling
abroad
if
i
could
anywhere
borrow
another
life
to
spend
afterwards
at
home
william
hazlitt
on
going
a
journey
the
peculiarity
of
in
the
traun
is
that
one
catches
principally
grayling
but
in
this
it
resembles
some
other
pursuits
which
are
not
without
their
charm
for
minds
open
to
the
pleasures
of
the
unexpected
for
example
reading
george
borrow
the
bible
in
spain
with
a
view
to
theological
information
or
going
to
the
opening
night
at
the
academy
of
design
with
the
intention
of
looking
at
pictures
moreover
there
are
really
trout
in
the
traun
rari
nantes
in
gurgite
and
in
some
places
more
than
in
others
and
all
of
high
spirit
though
few
of
great
size
thus
the
angler
has
his
favourite
problem
given
an
unknown
stream
and
two
kinds
of
fish
the
one
better
than
the
other
to
find
the
better
kind
and
determine
the
hour
at
which
they
will
rise
this
is
sport
as
for
the
little
river
itself
it
has
so
many
beauties
that
one
does
not
think
of
asking
whether
it
has
any
faults
constant
fulness
and
crystal
clearness
and
refreshing
coolness
of
living
water
pale
green
like
the
jewel
that
is
called
aqua
marina
flowing
over
beds
of
clean
sand
and
bars
of
polished
gravel
and
dropping
in
momentary
foam
from
rocky
ledges
between
banks
that
are
shaded
by
groves
of
fir
and
ash
and
poplar
or
through
dense
thickets
of
alder
and
willow
or
across
meadows
of
smooth
verdure
sloping
up
to
quaint
villages
all
these
are
features
of
the
ideal
little
river
i
have
spoken
of
these
personal
qualities
first
because
a
truly
moral
writer
ought
to
make
more
of
character
than
of
position
a
good
river
in
a
bad
country
would
be
more
worthy
of
affection
than
a
bad
river
in
a
good
country
but
the
traun
has
also
the
advantages
of
an
excellent
worldly
position
for
it
rises
all
over
the
salzkammergut
the
summer
of
the
austrian
emperor
and
flows
through
that
most
picturesque
corner
of
his
domain
from
end
to
end
under
the
desolate
cliffs
of
the
todtengebirge
on
the
east
and
below
the
shining
of
the
dachstein
on
the
south
and
from
the
green
alps
around
wolfgang
on
the
west
the
translucent
waters
are
gathered
in
little
tarns
and
shot
through
roaring
brooks
and
spread
into
lakes
of
wondrous
beauty
and
poured
through
growing
streams
until
at
last
they
are
all
united
just
below
the
summer
villa
of
his
kaiserly
and
kingly
majesty
francis
joseph
and
flow
away
northward
through
the
rest
of
his
into
the
traunsee
it
is
an
imperial
playground
and
such
as
i
would
consent
to
hunt
the
chamois
in
if
an
inscrutable
providence
had
made
me
a
kingly
kaiser
or
even
a
plain
king
or
an
unvarnished
kaiser
but
failing
this
i
was
perfectly
content
to
spend
a
few
idle
days
in
fishing
for
trout
and
catching
grayling
at
such
times
and
places
as
the
law
of
the
austrian
empire
allowed
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
every
stream
in
these
european
countries
belongs
to
somebody
by
purchase
or
rent
and
all
the
fish
in
the
stream
are
supposed
to
belong
to
the
person
who
owns
or
rents
it
they
do
not
know
their
master
voice
neither
will
they
follow
when
he
calls
but
they
are
theoretically
his
to
this
legal
fiction
the
untutored
american
must
conform
he
must
learn
to
clothe
his
natural
desires
in
the
raiment
of
lawful
sanction
and
take
out
some
kind
of
a
license
before
he
follows
his
impulse
to
fish
it
was
in
the
town
of
aussee
at
the
junction
of
the
two
highest
branches
of
the
traun
that
this
impulse
came
upon
me
mildly
irresistible
the
full
bloom
of
gayety
in
that
ancient
was
dampened
but
not
extinguished
by
two
days
of
persistent
and
surprising
showers
i
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
interest
in
the
old
gothic
church
and
felt
all
that
a
man
should
feel
in
deciphering
the
mural
tombstones
of
the
families
who
were
exiled
for
their
faith
in
the
days
of
the
reformation
the
throngs
of
merry
hebrews
from
vienna
and
amazingly
arrayed
as
mountaineers
and
walking
up
and
down
the
narrow
streets
under
umbrellas
had
cleopatra
charm
of
an
infinite
variety
but
custom
staled
it
the
woodland
paths
winding
everywhere
through
the
plantations
of
and
provided
with
appropriate
names
on
wooden
labels
and
benches
for
rest
and
conversation
at
discreet
intervals
were
too
moist
for
even
the
nymphs
to
take
delight
in
them
the
only
creatures
that
suffered
nothing
by
the
rain
were
the
two
swift
limpid
trauns
racing
through
the
woods
like
eager
and
unabashed
lovers
to
meet
in
the
middle
of
the
village
they
were
as
clear
as
joyous
as
musical
as
if
the
sun
were
shining
the
very
sight
of
their
opalescent
rapids
and
eddying
pools
was
an
invitation
to
that
gentle
sport
which
is
said
to
have
the
merit
of
growing
better
as
the
weather
grows
worse
i
laid
this
fact
before
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
of
the
erzherzog
johann
as
poetically
as
i
could
but
he
assured
me
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
without
an
invitation
from
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
streams
belonged
and
he
had
gone
away
for
a
week
the
landlord
was
such
a
person
and
such
an
excellent
sleeper
that
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
he
could
have
even
the
smallest
inaccuracy
upon
his
conscience
so
i
bade
him
farewell
and
took
my
way
four
miles
through
the
woods
to
the
lake
from
which
one
of
the
streams
flowed
it
was
called
the
grundlsee
as
i
do
not
know
the
origin
of
the
name
i
can
not
consistently
make
any
moral
or
historical
reflections
upon
it
but
if
it
has
never
become
famous
it
ought
to
be
for
the
sake
of
a
cozy
and
busy
little
inn
perched
on
a
green
hill
beside
the
lake
and
overlooking
the
whole
length
of
it
from
the
groups
of
toy
villas
at
the
foot
to
the
heaps
of
real
mountains
at
the
head
this
inn
kept
a
thin
but
happy
landlord
who
provided
me
with
a
blue
license
to
angle
for
the
inconsiderable
sum
of
fifteen
cents
a
day
this
conferred
the
right
of
fishing
not
only
in
the
grundlsee
but
also
in
the
smaller
tarn
of
toplitz
a
mile
above
it
and
in
the
swift
stream
which
unites
them
it
all
coincided
with
my
desire
as
if
by
magic
a
row
of
a
couple
of
miles
to
the
head
of
the
lake
and
a
walk
through
the
forest
brought
me
to
the
smaller
pond
and
as
the
afternoon
sun
was
ploughing
pale
furrows
through
the
showers
i
waded
out
on
a
point
of
reeds
and
cast
the
artful
fly
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
cliffs
of
the
dead
mountains
it
was
a
fit
scene
for
a
lone
fisherman
but
four
sociable
tourists
promptly
appeared
to
act
as
spectators
and
critics
usually
strikes
the
german
mind
as
an
eccentricity
which
calls
for
remonstrance
after
one
of
the
tourists
had
suggestively
narrated
the
tale
of
seven
trout
which
he
had
caught
in
another
lake
with
worms
on
the
previous
sunday
they
went
away
for
a
row
with
salutations
in
which
politeness
but
thinly
veiled
their
pity
and
left
me
still
whipping
the
water
in
vain
nor
was
the
fortune
of
the
day
much
better
in
the
stream
below
it
was
a
long
and
wet
wade
for
three
fish
too
small
to
keep
i
came
out
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
where
i
had
left
the
with
empty
bag
and
a
feeling
of
damp
discouragement
there
was
still
an
hour
or
so
of
daylight
and
a
beautiful
place
to
fish
where
the
stream
poured
swirling
out
into
the
lake
a
rise
and
a
large
one
though
rather
slow
awakened
my
hopes
another
rise
evidently
made
by
a
heavy
fish
made
me
certain
that
virtue
was
about
to
be
rewarded
the
third
time
the
hook
went
home
i
felt
the
solid
weight
of
the
fish
against
the
spring
of
the
rod
and
that
curious
thrill
which
runs
up
the
line
and
down
the
arm
changing
somehow
or
other
into
a
pleasurable
sensation
of
excitement
as
it
reaches
the
brain
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
then
came
that
foolish
feeble
shaking
of
the
line
from
side
to
side
which
tells
the
angler
that
he
has
hooked
a
great
big
chub
a
fish
which
izaak
walton
says
the
french
esteem
so
mean
as
to
call
him
un
vilain
was
it
for
this
that
i
had
come
to
the
country
of
francis
joseph
i
took
off
the
flies
and
put
on
one
of
those
phantom
minnows
which
have
immortalised
the
name
of
a
certain
brown
the
minnow
swung
on
a
long
line
as
the
boat
passed
back
and
forth
across
the
current
once
twice
three
times
and
on
the
fourth
circle
there
was
a
sharp
strike
the
rod
bent
almost
double
and
the
reel
sang
shrilly
to
the
first
rush
of
the
fish
he
ran
he
doubled
he
went
to
the
bottom
and
sulked
he
tried
to
go
under
the
boat
he
did
all
that
a
game
fish
can
do
except
leaping
after
twenty
minutes
he
was
tired
enough
to
be
lifted
gently
into
the
boat
by
a
hand
slipped
around
his
gills
and
there
he
was
a
lachsforelle
of
three
pounds
weight
small
pointed
head
silver
sides
mottled
with
dark
spots
square
powerful
tail
and
large
fins
a
fish
not
unlike
the
salmon
of
the
saguenay
but
more
delicate
half
an
hour
later
he
was
lying
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
inn
the
waiters
paused
with
their
hands
full
of
dishes
to
look
at
him
and
the
landlord
called
his
guests
including
my
didactic
tourists
to
observe
the
superiority
of
the
trout
of
the
grundlsee
the
maids
also
came
to
look
and
the
buxom
cook
with
her
spotless
apron
and
bare
arms
akimbo
was
drawn
from
her
kitchen
and
pledged
her
culinary
honour
that
such
a
should
be
served
up
in
her
very
best
style
the
angler
who
is
insensible
to
this
sort
of
indirect
flattery
through
his
fish
does
not
exist
even
the
most
indifferent
of
men
thinks
more
favourably
of
people
who
know
a
good
trout
when
they
see
it
and
sits
down
to
his
supper
with
kindly
feelings
possibly
he
reflects
also
upon
the
incident
as
a
hint
of
the
usual
size
of
the
fish
in
that
neighbourhood
he
remembers
that
he
may
have
been
favoured
in
this
case
beyond
his
deserts
by
and
resolving
not
to
put
too
heavy
a
strain
upon
it
considers
the
next
place
where
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
angle
hallstatt
is
about
ten
miles
below
aussee
the
traun
here
expands
into
a
lake
very
dark
and
deep
shut
in
by
steep
and
lofty
mountains
the
railway
runs
along
the
eastern
shore
on
the
other
side
a
mile
away
you
see
the
old
town
its
white
houses
clinging
to
the
cliff
like
lichens
to
the
face
of
a
rock
the
calls
it
a
highly
original
situation
but
this
is
one
of
the
cases
where
a
little
less
originality
and
a
little
more
reasonableness
might
be
desired
at
least
by
the
permanent
inhabitants
a
ledge
under
the
shadow
of
a
precipice
makes
a
trying
winter
residence
the
people
of
hallstatt
are
not
a
blooming
race
one
sees
many
dwarfs
and
cripples
among
them
but
to
the
summer
traveller
the
place
seems
wonderfully
picturesque
most
of
the
streets
are
flights
of
steps
the
has
barely
room
to
edge
itself
through
among
the
old
houses
between
the
of
bright
flowers
on
the
hottest
july
day
the
afternoon
is
cool
and
shady
the
gay
little
skiffs
and
long
open
gondolas
are
flitting
continually
along
the
lake
which
is
the
main
street
of
hallstatt
the
incongruous
but
comfortable
modern
hotel
has
a
huge
glass
veranda
where
you
can
eat
your
dinner
and
observe
human
nature
in
its
transparent
holiday
disguises
i
was
much
pleased
and
entertained
by
a
family
or
confederacy
of
people
attired
as
peasants
the
men
with
feathered
hats
green
stockings
and
bare
knees
the
women
with
bright
skirts
bodices
and
silk
neckerchiefs
who
were
always
in
evidence
rowing
gondolas
with
clumsy
oars
meeting
the
steamboat
at
the
wharf
several
times
a
day
and
filling
the
miniature
garden
of
the
hotel
with
rustic
greetings
and
early
salzkammergut
attitudes
after
much
conjecture
i
learned
that
they
were
the
family
and
friends
of
a
newspaper
editor
from
vienna
they
had
the
literary
instinct
for
local
colour
the
fishing
at
hallstatt
is
at
obertraun
there
is
a
level
stretch
of
land
above
the
lake
where
the
river
flows
peaceably
and
the
fish
have
leisure
to
feed
and
grow
it
is
leased
to
a
peasant
who
makes
a
business
of
supplying
the
hotels
with
fish
he
was
quite
willing
to
give
permission
to
an
angler
and
i
engaged
one
of
his
sons
a
capital
young
fellow
whose
natural
capacities
for
good
fellowship
were
only
hampered
by
a
most
extraordinary
german
dialect
to
row
me
across
the
lake
and
carry
the
net
and
a
small
green
barrel
full
of
water
to
keep
the
fish
alive
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
the
first
day
we
had
only
four
trout
large
enough
to
put
into
the
barrel
the
next
day
i
think
there
were
six
the
third
day
i
remember
very
well
there
were
ten
they
were
pretty
creatures
weighing
from
half
a
pound
to
a
pound
each
and
coloured
as
daintily
as
bits
of
french
silk
in
silver
gray
with
faint
pink
spots
there
was
plenty
to
do
at
hallstatt
in
the
mornings
an
hour
walk
from
the
town
there
was
a
fine
waterfall
three
hundred
feet
high
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
above
the
lake
was
one
of
the
for
which
the
region
is
celebrated
it
has
been
worked
for
ages
by
many
successive
races
from
the
celt
downward
perhaps
even
the
men
of
the
stone
age
knew
of
it
and
came
hither
for
seasoning
to
make
the
flesh
of
the
and
the
mammoth
more
palatable
modern
pilgrims
are
permitted
to
explore
the
long
wet
glittering
galleries
with
a
guide
and
slide
down
the
smooth
wooden
rollers
which
join
the
different
levels
of
the
mines
this
pastime
has
the
same
fascination
as
sliding
down
the
balusters
and
it
is
said
that
even
queens
and
princesses
have
been
delighted
with
it
this
is
a
touching
proof
of
the
fundamental
simplicity
and
unity
of
our
human
nature
but
by
far
the
best
excursion
from
hallstatt
was
an
trip
to
the
zwieselalp
a
mountain
which
seems
to
have
been
especially
created
as
a
point
of
view
from
the
bare
summit
you
look
right
into
the
face
of
the
huge
snowy
dachstein
with
the
wild
lake
of
gosau
gleaming
at
its
foot
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
your
vision
ranges
over
a
confusion
of
mountains
with
all
the
white
peaks
of
the
tyrol
stretched
along
the
horizon
such
a
wide
outlook
as
this
helps
the
fisherman
to
enjoy
the
narrow
beauties
of
his
little
rivers
no
sport
is
at
its
best
without
interruption
and
contrast
to
appreciate
wading
one
ought
to
climb
a
little
on
odd
days
isehl
is
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
below
hallstatt
in
the
valley
of
the
traun
it
is
the
fashionable
of
austria
i
found
it
in
the
high
tide
of
amusement
the
shady
esplanade
along
the
river
was
crowded
with
brave
women
and
fair
men
in
gorgeous
raiment
the
hotels
were
overflowing
and
there
were
various
kinds
of
music
and
entertainments
at
all
hours
of
day
and
night
but
all
this
did
not
seem
to
affect
the
fishing
the
landlord
of
the
konigin
elizabeth
who
is
also
the
burgomaster
and
a
gentleman
of
varied
accomplishments
and
no
leisure
kindly
furnished
me
with
a
fishing
license
in
the
shape
of
a
large
pink
card
there
were
many
rules
printed
upon
it
all
fishes
under
nine
inches
must
be
gently
restored
to
the
water
no
instrument
of
capture
must
be
used
except
the
angle
in
the
hand
the
card
of
legitimation
must
be
produced
and
exhibited
at
the
polite
request
of
any
of
the
keepers
of
the
river
thus
duly
authorised
and
instructed
i
sallied
forth
to
seek
my
pastime
according
to
the
law
the
easiest
way
in
theory
was
to
take
the
afternoon
train
up
the
river
to
one
of
the
villages
and
fish
down
a
mile
or
two
in
the
evening
returning
by
the
eight
train
but
in
practice
the
habits
of
the
fish
interfered
seriously
with
the
latter
part
of
this
plan
on
my
first
day
i
had
spent
several
hours
in
the
vain
effort
to
catch
something
better
than
small
grayling
the
best
time
for
the
trout
was
just
approaching
as
the
broad
light
faded
from
the
stream
already
they
were
beginning
to
feed
when
i
looked
up
from
the
edge
of
a
pool
and
saw
the
train
rattling
down
the
valley
below
me
under
the
circumstances
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
go
on
fishing
it
was
an
even
pool
with
steep
banks
and
the
water
ran
through
it
very
straight
and
swift
some
four
feet
deep
and
thirty
yards
across
as
the
reached
the
middle
of
the
water
a
fine
trout
literally
turned
a
somersault
over
it
but
without
touching
it
at
the
next
cast
he
was
ready
taking
it
with
a
rush
that
carried
him
into
the
air
with
the
fly
in
his
mouth
he
weighed
of
a
pound
the
next
one
was
equally
eager
in
rising
and
sharp
in
playing
and
the
third
might
have
been
his
twin
sister
or
brother
so
after
casting
for
hours
and
taking
nothing
in
the
most
beautiful
pools
i
landed
three
trout
from
one
unlikely
place
in
fifteen
minutes
that
was
because
the
trout
had
arrived
so
had
mine
i
walked
over
to
the
rambling
old
inn
at
goisern
sought
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
and
persuaded
her
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
boil
the
largest
of
the
fish
for
my
supper
after
which
i
rode
peacefully
back
to
ischl
by
the
eleven
train
for
the
future
i
resolved
to
give
up
the
illusory
idea
of
coming
home
by
rail
and
ordered
a
little
carriage
to
meet
me
at
some
point
on
the
every
evening
at
nine
in
this
way
i
managed
to
cover
the
whole
stream
taking
a
lower
part
each
day
from
the
lake
of
hallstatt
down
to
ischl
there
was
one
part
of
the
river
near
laufen
where
the
current
was
very
strong
and
waterfally
broken
by
ledges
of
rock
below
these
it
rested
in
long
smooth
reaches
much
beloved
by
the
grayling
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
two
or
three
of
them
out
of
each
run
the
grayling
has
a
quaint
beauty
his
appearance
is
aesthetic
like
a
fish
in
a
picture
his
colour
in
midsummer
is
a
golden
gray
darker
on
the
back
and
with
a
few
black
spots
just
behind
his
gills
like
patches
put
on
to
bring
out
the
pallor
of
his
complexion
he
smells
of
wild
thyme
when
he
first
comes
out
of
the
water
wherefore
ambrose
of
milan
complimented
him
in
courtly
fashion
quid
specie
tua
gratius
quid
odore
fragrantius
quod
mella
fragrant
hoc
tuo
corpore
spiras
but
the
chief
glory
of
the
grayling
is
the
large
iridescent
fin
on
his
back
you
see
it
cutting
the
water
as
he
swims
near
the
surface
and
when
you
have
him
on
the
bank
it
arches
over
him
like
a
rainbow
his
mouth
is
under
his
chin
and
he
takes
the
fly
gently
by
suction
he
is
in
fact
and
to
speak
plainly
something
of
a
sucker
but
then
he
is
a
sucker
idealised
and
refined
the
flower
of
the
family
charles
cotton
the
ingenious
young
friend
of
walton
was
all
wrong
in
calling
the
grayling
one
of
the
fishes
in
the
world
he
fights
and
leaps
and
whirls
and
brings
his
big
fin
to
bear
across
the
force
of
the
current
with
a
variety
of
tactics
that
would
put
his
more
aristocratic
the
trout
to
the
blush
twelve
of
these
pretty
fellows
with
a
brace
of
good
trout
for
the
top
filled
my
big
creel
to
the
brim
and
yet
such
is
the
inborn
hypocrisy
of
the
human
heart
that
i
always
pretended
to
myself
to
be
disappointed
because
there
were
not
more
trout
and
made
light
of
the
grayling
as
a
thing
of
naught
the
pink
fishing
license
did
not
seem
to
be
of
much
use
its
exhibition
was
demanded
only
twice
once
a
river
guardian
who
was
walking
down
the
stream
with
a
belgian
baron
and
encouraging
him
to
continue
fishing
climbed
out
to
me
on
the
end
of
a
long
embankment
and
with
proper
apologies
begged
to
be
favoured
with
a
view
of
my
document
it
turned
out
that
his
request
was
a
favour
to
me
for
it
discovered
the
fact
that
i
had
left
my
with
the
pink
card
in
it
beside
an
old
mill
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
stream
another
time
i
was
sitting
beside
the
road
trying
to
get
out
of
a
very
long
wet
awkward
pair
of
an
occupation
which
is
unfavourable
to
tranquillity
of
mind
when
a
man
came
up
to
me
in
the
dusk
and
accosted
me
with
an
absence
of
politeness
which
in
german
amounted
to
an
insult
have
you
been
fishing
why
do
you
want
to
know
have
you
any
right
to
fish
what
right
have
you
to
ask
i
am
a
keeper
of
the
river
where
is
your
card
it
is
in
my
pocket
but
pardon
my
curiosity
where
is
your
card
this
question
appeared
to
paralyse
him
he
had
probably
never
been
asked
for
his
card
before
he
went
lumbering
off
in
the
darkness
muttering
my
card
unheard
of
my
card
the
routine
of
angling
at
ischl
was
varied
by
an
excursion
to
the
lake
of
wolfgang
and
the
schafberg
an
isolated
mountain
on
whose
rocky
horn
an
inn
has
been
built
it
stands
up
almost
like
a
on
a
pole
and
commands
a
superb
prospect
northward
across
the
rolling
plain
and
the
bavarian
forest
southward
over
a
tumultuous
land
of
peaks
and
precipices
there
are
many
lovely
lakes
in
sight
but
the
loveliest
of
all
is
that
which
takes
its
name
from
the
old
saint
who
wandered
hither
from
the
country
of
the
furious
franks
and
built
his
peaceful
hermitage
on
the
falkenstein
what
good
taste
some
of
those
old
saints
had
there
is
a
venerable
church
in
the
village
with
pictures
attributed
to
michael
wohlgemuth
and
a
chapel
which
is
said
to
mark
the
spot
where
wolfgang
who
had
lost
his
axe
far
up
the
mountain
found
it
like
longfellow
arrow
in
an
oak
and
still
unbroke
the
tree
is
gone
so
it
was
impossible
to
verify
the
story
but
the
saint
well
is
there
in
a
pavilion
with
a
bronze
image
over
it
and
a
profitable
inscription
to
the
effect
that
the
poorer
pilgrims
who
have
come
unprovided
with
either
money
or
wine
should
be
jolly
well
contented
to
find
the
water
so
fine
there
is
also
a
famous
echo
farther
up
the
lake
which
repeats
six
syllables
with
accuracy
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
there
are
just
six
syllables
in
the
name
of
der
heilige
wolfgang
but
when
you
translate
it
into
english
the
inspiration
of
the
echo
seems
to
be
less
exact
the
sweetest
thing
about
wolfgang
was
the
abundance
of
purple
cyclamens
clothing
the
mountain
meadows
and
filling
the
air
with
delicate
fragrance
like
the
smell
of
lilacs
around
a
new
england
farmhouse
in
early
june
there
was
still
one
stretch
of
the
river
above
ischl
left
for
the
last
evening
sport
i
remember
it
so
well
the
long
deep
place
where
the
water
ran
beside
an
embankment
of
stone
and
the
big
grayling
poised
on
the
edge
of
the
shadow
rising
and
falling
on
the
current
as
a
kite
rises
and
falls
on
the
wind
and
balances
back
to
the
same
position
the
murmur
of
the
stream
and
the
hissing
of
the
pebbles
underfoot
in
the
rapids
as
the
swift
water
rolled
them
over
and
over
the
odour
of
the
and
the
streaks
of
warm
air
in
quiet
places
and
the
faint
whiffs
of
wafted
from
the
houses
and
the
brown
flies
dancing
heavily
up
and
down
in
the
twilight
the
last
good
pool
where
the
river
was
divided
the
main
part
making
a
deep
narrow
curve
to
the
right
and
the
lesser
part
bubbling
into
it
over
a
bed
of
stones
with
tiny
waterfalls
with
a
fine
trout
lying
at
the
foot
of
each
of
them
and
rising
merrily
as
the
white
fly
passed
over
him
surely
it
was
all
very
good
and
a
memory
to
be
grateful
for
and
when
the
basket
was
full
it
was
pleasant
to
put
off
the
heavy
and
the
long
and
ride
homeward
in
an
open
carriage
through
the
fresh
night
air
that
is
as
near
to
sybaritic
luxury
as
a
man
should
care
to
come
the
lights
in
the
cottages
are
twinkling
like
and
there
are
small
groups
of
people
singing
and
laughing
down
the
road
the
honest
fisherman
reflects
that
this
world
is
only
a
place
of
pilgrimage
but
after
all
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cheer
on
the
journey
if
it
is
made
with
a
contented
heart
he
wonders
who
the
dwellers
in
the
scattered
houses
may
be
and
weaves
romances
out
of
the
shadows
on
the
curtained
windows
the
lamps
burning
in
the
wayside
shrines
tell
him
stories
of
human
love
and
patience
and
hope
and
of
divine
forgiveness
of
life
float
before
him
tender
and
luminous
filled
with
a
vague
soft
atmosphere
in
which
the
simplest
outlines
gain
a
strange
significance
they
are
like
some
of
millet
paintings
the
sower
or
the
sheepfold
there
is
very
little
detail
in
them
but
sometimes
a
little
means
so
much
then
the
moon
slips
up
into
the
sky
from
behind
the
hills
and
the
fisherman
begins
to
think
of
home
and
of
the
foolish
fond
old
rhymes
about
those
whom
the
moon
sees
far
away
and
the
stars
that
have
the
power
to
fulfil
wishes
as
if
the
celestial
bodies
knew
or
cared
anything
about
our
small
which
we
call
affection
and
desires
but
if
there
were
some
one
above
the
moon
and
stars
who
did
know
and
care
some
one
who
could
see
the
places
and
the
people
that
you
and
i
would
give
so
much
to
see
some
one
who
could
do
for
them
all
of
kindness
that
you
and
i
fain
would
do
some
one
able
to
keep
our
beloved
in
perfect
peace
and
watch
over
the
little
children
sleeping
in
their
beds
beyond
the
sea
what
then
why
then
in
the
evening
hour
one
might
have
thoughts
of
home
that
would
go
across
the
ocean
by
way
of
heaven
and
be
better
than
dreams
almost
as
good
as
prayers
at
the
sign
of
the
balsam
bough
come
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
and
we
will
all
the
pleasures
prove
that
valleys
groves
or
hills
or
field
or
woods
and
steepy
mountains
yield
there
we
will
rest
our
sleepy
heads
and
happy
hearts
on
balsam
beds
and
every
day
go
forth
to
fish
in
foamy
streams
for
ouananiche
old
song
with
a
new
ending
it
has
been
asserted
on
high
philosophical
authority
that
woman
is
a
problem
she
is
more
she
is
a
cause
of
problems
to
others
this
is
not
a
theoretical
statement
it
is
a
fact
of
experience
every
year
when
the
sun
passes
the
summer
solstice
the
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
of
whom
i
am
so
fortunate
as
to
be
one
are
summoned
by
that
portion
of
our
united
mind
which
has
at
once
the
right
of
putting
the
question
and
of
casting
the
deciding
vote
to
answer
this
conundrum
how
can
we
go
abroad
without
crossing
the
ocean
and
abandon
an
interesting
family
of
children
without
getting
completely
beyond
their
reach
and
escape
from
the
of
housekeeping
without
falling
into
the
fire
of
the
summer
hotel
this
apparently
insoluble
problem
we
usually
solve
by
going
to
camp
in
canada
it
is
indeed
a
foreign
air
that
breathes
around
us
as
we
make
the
harmless
friendly
voyage
from
point
levis
to
quebec
the
boy
on
the
who
cajoles
us
into
buying
a
copy
of
le
moniteur
containing
last
month
news
has
the
address
of
a
true
though
diminutive
frenchman
the
landlord
of
the
quiet
little
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
welcomes
us
with
gallic
effusion
as
guests
and
rubs
his
hands
genially
before
us
while
he
escorts
us
to
our
apartments
groping
secretly
in
his
memory
to
recall
our
names
when
we
walk
down
the
steep
quaint
streets
to
revel
in
the
purchase
of
moccasins
and
coats
and
camping
supplies
we
read
on
a
wall
the
familiar
but
transformed
legend
pleurs
il
veut
son
camphoria
and
remember
with
joy
that
no
infant
who
weeps
in
french
can
impose
any
responsibility
upon
us
in
these
days
of
our
renewed
honeymoon
but
the
true
delight
of
the
expedition
begins
when
the
tents
have
been
set
up
in
the
forest
back
of
lake
john
and
the
green
branches
have
been
broken
for
the
woodland
bed
and
the
fire
has
been
lit
under
the
open
sky
and
the
livery
of
fashion
being
all
discarded
i
sit
down
at
a
log
table
to
eat
supper
with
my
lady
greygown
then
life
seems
simple
and
amiable
and
well
worth
living
then
the
uproar
and
confusion
of
the
world
die
away
from
us
and
we
hear
only
the
steady
murmur
of
the
river
and
the
low
voice
of
the
wind
in
the
then
time
is
long
and
the
only
art
that
is
needful
for
its
enjoyment
is
short
and
easy
then
we
taste
true
comfort
while
we
lodge
with
mother
green
at
the
sign
of
the
balsam
bough
i
under
the
white
birches
men
may
say
what
they
will
in
praise
of
their
houses
and
grow
eloquent
upon
the
merits
of
various
styles
of
architecture
but
for
our
part
we
are
agreed
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
compared
with
a
tent
it
is
the
most
venerable
and
aristocratic
form
of
human
habitation
abraham
and
sarah
lived
in
it
and
shared
its
hospitality
with
angels
it
is
exempt
from
the
base
tyranny
of
the
plumber
the
and
the
it
is
not
immovably
bound
to
one
dull
spot
of
earth
by
the
chains
of
a
cellar
and
a
system
of
it
has
a
noble
freedom
of
locomotion
it
follows
the
wishes
of
its
inhabitants
and
goes
with
them
a
travelling
home
as
the
spirit
moves
them
to
explore
the
wilderness
at
their
pleasure
new
beds
of
wild
flowers
surround
it
new
plantations
of
trees
overshadow
it
and
new
avenues
of
shining
water
lead
to
its
door
what
the
tent
lacks
in
luxury
it
makes
up
in
liberty
or
rather
let
us
say
that
liberty
itself
is
the
greatest
luxury
another
thing
is
worth
remembering
a
family
which
lives
in
a
tent
never
can
have
a
skeleton
in
the
closet
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
every
spot
in
the
woods
is
suitable
for
a
camp
or
that
a
good
can
be
chosen
without
knowledge
and
forethought
one
of
the
requisites
indeed
is
to
be
found
everywhere
in
the
john
region
for
all
the
lakes
and
rivers
are
full
of
clear
cool
water
and
the
traveller
does
not
need
to
search
for
a
spring
but
it
is
always
necessary
to
look
carefully
for
a
bit
of
smooth
ground
on
the
shore
far
enough
above
the
water
to
be
dry
and
slightly
sloping
so
that
the
head
of
the
bed
may
be
higher
than
the
foot
above
all
it
must
be
free
from
big
stones
and
serpentine
roots
of
trees
a
root
that
looks
no
bigger
that
an
in
the
daytime
assumes
the
proportions
of
a
at
midnight
when
you
find
it
under
your
there
should
also
be
plenty
of
evergreens
near
at
hand
for
the
beds
spruce
will
answer
at
a
pinch
it
has
an
aromatic
smell
but
it
is
too
stiff
and
humpy
hemlock
is
smoother
and
more
flexible
but
the
spring
soon
wears
out
of
it
the
with
its
elastic
branches
and
thick
flat
needles
is
the
best
of
all
a
bed
of
these
boughs
a
foot
deep
is
softer
than
a
mattress
and
as
fragrant
as
a
thousand
two
things
more
are
needed
for
the
ideal
an
open
situation
where
the
breeze
will
drive
away
the
flies
and
mosquitoes
and
an
abundance
of
dry
firewood
within
easy
reach
yes
and
a
third
thing
must
not
be
forgotten
for
says
my
lady
greygown
i
should
feel
at
home
in
camp
unless
i
could
sit
in
the
door
of
the
tent
and
look
out
across
flowing
water
all
these
conditions
are
met
in
our
favourite
camping
place
below
the
first
fall
in
the
grande
decharge
a
rocky
point
juts
out
into
the
rivet
and
makes
a
fine
landing
for
the
canoes
there
is
a
dismantled
a
few
rods
back
in
the
woods
from
which
we
can
borrow
boards
for
a
table
and
chairs
a
group
of
cedars
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
point
opens
just
wide
enough
to
receive
and
shelter
our
tent
at
a
good
distance
beyond
ours
the
guides
tent
is
pitched
and
the
big
burns
between
the
two
dwellings
a
pair
of
lift
their
leafy
crowns
far
above
us
and
after
them
we
name
the
place
le
camp
aux
bouleaux
why
not
call
trees
people
since
if
you
come
to
live
among
them
year
after
year
you
will
learn
to
know
many
of
them
personally
and
an
attachment
will
grow
up
between
you
and
them
individually
so
writes
that
doctor
amabilis
of
woodcraft
prime
in
his
book
among
the
northern
hills
and
straightway
launches
forth
into
eulogy
on
the
and
truly
it
is
an
admirable
lovable
and
comfortable
tree
beautiful
to
look
upon
and
full
of
various
uses
its
wood
is
strong
to
make
paddles
and
axe
handles
and
glorious
to
burn
blazing
up
at
first
with
a
flashing
flame
and
then
holding
the
fire
in
its
glowing
heart
all
through
the
night
its
bark
is
the
most
serviceable
of
all
the
products
of
the
wilderness
in
russia
they
say
it
is
used
in
tanning
and
gives
its
subtle
sacerdotal
fragrance
to
russia
leather
but
here
in
the
woods
it
serves
more
primitive
ends
it
can
be
peeled
off
in
a
huge
roll
from
some
giant
tree
and
fashioned
into
a
swift
canoe
to
carry
man
over
the
waters
it
can
be
cut
into
square
sheets
to
roof
his
shanty
in
the
forest
it
is
the
paper
on
which
he
writes
his
woodland
despatches
and
the
flexible
material
which
he
bends
into
of
silver
lined
with
gold
a
thin
strip
of
it
wrapped
around
the
end
of
a
candle
and
fastened
in
a
cleft
stick
makes
a
practicable
chandelier
a
basket
for
berries
a
horn
to
call
the
lovelorn
moose
through
the
autumnal
woods
a
canvas
on
which
to
draw
the
outline
of
great
and
memorable
fish
all
these
and
many
other
indispensable
luxuries
are
stored
up
for
the
skilful
woodsman
in
the
birch
bark
only
do
not
rob
or
mar
the
tree
unless
you
really
need
what
it
has
to
give
you
let
it
stand
and
grow
in
virgin
majesty
ungirdled
and
unscarred
while
the
trunk
becomes
a
firm
pillar
of
the
forest
temple
and
the
branches
spread
abroad
a
refuge
of
bright
green
leaves
for
the
birds
of
the
air
nature
never
made
a
more
excellent
piece
of
handiwork
and
if
said
my
lady
greygown
i
should
ever
become
a
dryad
i
would
choose
to
be
transformed
into
a
and
then
when
the
days
of
my
life
were
numbered
and
the
sap
had
ceased
to
flow
and
the
last
leaf
had
fallen
and
the
dry
bark
hung
around
me
in
ragged
curls
and
streamers
some
wandering
hunter
would
come
in
the
wintry
night
and
touch
a
lighted
coal
to
my
body
and
my
spirit
would
flash
up
in
a
fiery
chariot
into
the
sky
the
chief
occupation
of
our
idle
days
on
the
grande
decharge
was
fishing
above
the
camp
spread
a
noble
pool
more
than
two
miles
in
circumference
and
diversified
with
smooth
bays
and
whirling
eddies
sand
beaches
and
rocky
islands
the
river
poured
into
it
at
the
head
foaming
and
raging
down
a
long
chute
and
swept
out
of
it
just
in
front
of
our
camp
in
a
merry
musical
rapid
it
was
full
of
fish
of
various
kinds
pickerel
pike
and
stupid
chub
but
the
prince
of
the
pool
was
the
fighting
ouananiche
the
little
salmon
of
john
here
let
me
chant
thy
praise
thou
noblest
and
most
fish
the
cleanest
feeder
the
merriest
liver
the
loftiest
leaper
and
the
bravest
warrior
of
all
creatures
that
swim
thy
cousin
the
trout
in
his
purple
and
gold
with
crimson
spots
wears
a
more
splendid
armour
than
thy
russet
and
silver
mottled
with
black
but
thine
is
the
kinglier
nature
his
courage
and
skill
compared
with
thine
are
as
moonlight
unto
sunlight
and
as
water
unto
wine
the
old
salmon
of
the
sea
who
begot
thee
long
ago
in
these
inland
waters
became
a
backslider
descending
again
to
the
ocean
and
grew
gross
and
heavy
with
coarse
feeding
but
thou
unsalted
salmon
of
the
foaming
floods
not
landlocked
as
men
call
thee
but
choosing
of
thine
own
to
dwell
on
a
loftier
level
in
the
pure
swift
current
of
a
living
stream
hast
grown
in
grace
and
risen
to
a
higher
life
thou
art
not
to
be
measured
by
quantity
but
by
quality
and
thy
five
pounds
of
pure
vigour
will
outweigh
a
score
of
pounds
of
flesh
less
vitalised
by
spirit
thou
feedest
on
the
flies
of
the
air
and
thy
food
is
transformed
into
an
aerial
passion
for
flight
as
thou
springest
across
the
pool
vaulting
toward
the
sky
thine
eyes
have
grown
large
and
keen
by
peering
through
the
foam
and
the
feathered
hook
that
can
deceive
thee
must
be
deftly
tied
and
delicately
cast
thy
tail
and
fins
by
ceaseless
conflict
with
the
rapids
have
broadened
and
strengthened
so
that
they
can
flash
thy
slender
body
like
a
living
arrow
up
the
fall
as
lancelot
among
the
knights
so
art
thou
among
the
fish
the
hero
the
sunburnt
champion
of
all
the
every
morning
and
evening
greygown
and
i
would
go
out
for
ouananiche
and
sometimes
we
caught
plenty
and
sometimes
few
but
we
never
came
back
without
a
good
catch
of
happiness
there
were
certain
places
where
the
fish
liked
to
stay
for
example
we
always
looked
for
one
at
the
lower
corner
of
a
big
rock
very
close
to
it
where
he
could
poise
himself
easily
on
the
edge
of
the
strong
downward
stream
another
likely
place
was
a
straight
run
of
water
swift
but
not
too
swift
with
a
sunken
stone
in
the
middle
the
ouananiche
does
not
like
crooked
twisting
water
an
even
current
is
far
more
comfortable
for
then
he
discovers
just
how
much
effort
is
needed
to
balance
against
it
and
keeps
up
the
movement
mechanically
as
if
he
were
half
asleep
but
his
favourite
place
is
under
one
of
the
floating
islands
of
thick
foam
that
gather
in
the
corners
below
the
falls
the
matted
flakes
give
a
grateful
shelter
from
the
sun
i
fancy
and
almost
all
love
to
lie
in
the
shade
but
the
chief
reason
why
the
onananiche
haunt
the
drifting
white
mass
is
because
it
is
full
of
flies
and
gnats
beaten
down
by
the
spray
of
the
cataract
and
sprinkled
all
through
the
foam
like
plums
in
a
cake
to
this
natural
confection
the
little
salmon
lurking
in
his
corner
plays
the
part
of
jack
horner
all
day
long
and
never
wearies
see
that
belle
brou
down
below
there
said
ferdinand
as
we
scrambled
over
the
huge
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
there
ought
to
be
salmon
there
en
masse
yes
there
were
the
sharp
noses
picking
out
the
unfortunate
insects
and
the
broad
tails
waving
lazily
through
the
foam
as
the
fish
turned
in
the
water
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
summer
is
nearly
ended
and
every
ouananiche
in
the
grande
decharge
has
tasted
feathers
and
seen
a
hook
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
delude
them
with
the
large
gaudy
flies
which
the
recommends
there
are
only
two
successful
methods
of
angling
now
the
first
of
these
i
tried
and
by
casting
delicately
with
a
tiny
brown
tied
on
a
gossamer
strand
of
gut
captured
a
pair
of
fish
weighing
about
three
pounds
each
they
fought
against
the
spring
of
the
rod
for
nearly
half
an
hour
before
ferdinand
could
slip
the
net
around
them
but
there
was
another
and
a
broader
tail
still
waving
disdainfully
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
foam
and
now
said
the
gallant
ferdinand
the
turn
is
to
madame
that
she
should
prove
her
fortune
attend
but
a
moment
madame
while
i
seek
the
sauterelle
this
was
the
second
method
the
grasshopper
was
attached
to
the
hook
and
casting
the
line
well
out
across
the
pool
ferdinand
put
the
rod
into
greygown
hands
she
stood
poised
upon
a
pinnacle
of
rock
like
patience
on
a
monument
waiting
for
a
bite
it
came
there
was
a
slow
gentle
pull
at
the
line
answered
by
a
quick
jerk
of
the
rod
and
a
noble
fish
flashed
into
the
air
four
pounds
and
a
half
at
least
he
leaped
again
and
again
shaking
the
drops
from
his
silvery
sides
he
rushed
up
the
rapids
as
if
he
had
determined
to
return
to
the
lake
and
down
again
as
if
he
had
changed
his
plans
and
determined
to
go
to
the
saguenay
he
sulked
in
the
deep
water
and
rubbed
his
nose
against
the
rocks
he
did
his
best
to
treat
that
treacherous
grasshopper
as
the
whale
served
jonah
but
greygown
through
all
her
little
screams
and
shouts
of
excitement
was
steady
and
sage
she
never
gave
the
fish
an
inch
of
slack
line
and
at
last
he
lay
glittering
on
the
rocks
with
the
black
andrew
crosses
clearly
marked
on
his
plump
sides
and
the
iridescent
spots
gleaming
on
his
small
shapely
head
une
belle
cried
ferdinand
as
he
held
up
the
fish
in
triumph
and
it
is
madame
who
has
the
good
fortune
she
understands
well
to
take
the
large
fish
is
it
not
greygown
stepped
demurely
down
from
her
pinnacle
and
as
we
drifted
down
the
pool
in
the
canoe
under
the
mellow
evening
sky
her
conversation
betrayed
not
a
trace
of
the
pride
that
a
victorious
fisherman
would
have
shown
on
the
contrary
she
insisted
that
angling
was
an
affair
of
chance
which
was
consoling
though
i
knew
it
was
not
altogether
true
and
that
the
smaller
fish
were
just
as
pleasant
to
catch
and
better
to
eat
after
all
for
a
generous
rival
commend
me
to
a
woman
and
if
i
must
compete
let
it
be
with
one
who
has
the
grace
to
dissolve
the
bitter
of
defeat
in
the
honey
of
a
mutual
we
had
a
garden
and
our
favourite
path
through
it
was
the
portage
leading
around
the
falls
we
travelled
it
very
frequently
making
an
excuse
of
idle
errands
to
the
on
the
lake
and
sauntering
along
the
trail
as
if
school
were
out
and
would
never
keep
again
it
was
the
season
of
fruits
rather
than
of
flowers
nature
was
reducing
the
decorations
of
her
table
to
make
room
for
the
banquet
she
offered
us
berries
instead
of
blossoms
there
were
the
light
coral
clusters
of
the
dwarf
cornel
set
in
whorls
of
pointed
leaves
and
the
deep
blue
bells
of
the
clintonia
borealis
which
the
white
mountain
people
call
the
and
i
hope
the
name
will
stick
for
it
smacks
of
the
woods
and
it
is
a
shame
to
leave
so
free
and
wild
a
plant
under
the
burden
of
a
latin
name
and
the
gray
berries
for
which
the
canada
mayflower
had
exchanged
its
feathery
white
bloom
and
the
ruby
drops
of
the
twisted
stalk
hanging
like
jewels
along
its
bending
stem
on
the
table
which
once
carried
the
gay
flower
of
the
there
was
a
scarlet
lump
like
a
red
pepper
escaped
to
the
forest
and
run
wild
the
was
full
of
rosy
provision
for
the
birds
the
dark
tiny
leaves
of
the
creeping
were
all
sprinkled
over
with
delicate
drops
of
spicy
foam
there
were
few
belated
raspberries
and
if
we
chose
to
go
out
into
the
burnt
ground
we
could
find
blueberries
in
plenty
but
there
was
still
bloom
enough
to
give
that
festal
air
without
which
the
most
abundant
feast
seems
coarse
and
vulgar
the
pale
gold
of
the
loosestrife
had
faded
but
the
deeper
yellow
of
the
goldenrod
had
begun
to
take
its
place
the
blue
banners
of
the
had
vanished
from
beside
the
springs
but
the
purple
of
the
asters
was
appearing
closed
gentians
kept
their
secret
inviolate
and
bluebells
trembled
above
the
rocks
the
quaint
flowers
of
the
showed
in
wet
places
and
instead
of
the
lilac
racemes
of
the
orchis
which
had
disappeared
with
midsummer
we
found
now
the
slender
braided
spikes
of
the
latest
and
lowliest
of
the
orchids
pale
and
pure
as
nuns
of
the
forest
and
exhaling
a
celestial
fragrance
there
is
a
secret
pleasure
in
finding
these
delicate
flowers
in
the
rough
heart
of
the
wilderness
it
is
like
discovering
the
veins
of
poetry
in
the
character
of
a
guide
or
a
lumberman
and
to
be
able
to
call
the
plants
by
name
makes
them
a
hundredfold
more
sweet
and
intimate
naming
things
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
simplest
of
human
pastimes
children
play
at
it
with
their
dolls
and
toy
animals
in
fact
it
was
the
first
game
ever
played
on
earth
for
the
creator
who
planted
the
garden
eastward
in
eden
knew
well
what
would
please
the
childish
heart
of
man
when
he
brought
all
the
creatures
to
adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
them
our
rustic
bouquet
graced
the
table
under
the
while
we
sat
by
the
fire
and
watched
our
four
men
at
the
work
of
the
camp
joseph
and
raoul
chopping
wood
in
the
distance
francois
slicing
juicy
rashers
from
the
flitch
of
bacon
and

the

heating

preparation
for
supper
have
you
ever
thought
said
greygown
in
a
contented
tone
of
voice
that
this
is
the
only
period
of
our
existence
when
we
attain
to
the
luxury
of
a
french
cook
and
one
with
the
grand
manner
too
i
replied
for
he
never
fails
to
ask
what
it
is
that
madame
desires
to
eat
as
if
the
larder
of
lucullus
were
at
his
disposal
though
he
knows
well
enough
that
the
only
choice
lies
between
broiled
fish
and
fried
fish
or
bacon
with
eggs
and
a
rice
omelet
but
i
like
the
fiction
of
a
lordly
ordering
of
the
repast
how
much
better
it
is
than
having
to
eat
what
is
flung
before
you
at
a
summer
by
a
scornful
waitress
another
thing
that
pleases
me
continued
my
lady
is
the
unbreakableness
of
the
dishes
there
are
no
nicks
in
the
edges
of
the
best
plates
here
and
oh
it
is
a
happy
thing
to
have
a
home
without
there
is
nothing
here
that
needs
to
be
dusted
and
no
engagements
for
i
ejaculated
dishes
that
ca
be
broken
and
plans
that
can
that
the
ideal
of
housekeeping
and
then
added
my
philosopher
in
skirts
it
is
certainly
refreshing
to
get
away
from
all
one
relations
for
a
little
while
but
how
do
you
make
that
out
i
asked
in
mild
surprise
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
oh
said
she
with
a
fine
air
of
independence
i
do
count
you
you
are
not
a
relation
only
a
connection
by
marriage
well
my
dear
i
answered
between
the
meditative
puffs
of
my
pipe
it
is
good
to
consider
the
advantages
of
our
present
situation
we
shall
soon
come
into
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
sultan
of
morocco
when
he
camped
in
the
vale
of
rabat
the
place
pleased
him
so
well
that
he
staid
until
the
very
pegs
of
his
tent
took
root
and
grew
up
into
a
grove
of
trees
around
his
pavilion
ii
kenogami
the
guides
were
a
little
restless
under
the
idle
regime
of
our
lazy
camp
and
urged
us
to
set
out
upon
some
adventure
ferdinand
was
like
the
uncouth
swain
in
lycidas
sitting
upon
the
bundles
of
camp
equipage
on
the
shore
and
crying
to
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
he
led
us
forth
to
seek
the
famous
fishing
grounds
on
lake
kenogami
we
skirted
the
eastern
end
of
lake
john
in
our
two
canoes
and
pushed
up
la
belle
riviere
to
hebertville
where
all
the
children
turned
out
to
follow
our
procession
through
the
village
it
was
like
the
train
that
tagged
after
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
we
embarked
again
surrounded
by
an
admiring
throng
at
the
bridge
where
the
main
street
crossed
a
little
stream
and
paddled
up
it
through
a
score
of
back
yards
and
a
stretch
of
reedy
meadows
where
the
wild
and
tame
ducks
fed
together
tempting
the
sportsman
to
sins
of
ignorance
we
crossed
the
placid
lac
vert
and
after
a
carry
of
a
mile
along
the
toward
chicoutimi
turned
down
a
steep
hill
and
pitched
our
tents
on
a
crescent
of
silver
sand
with
the
long
fair
water
of
kenogami
before
us
it
is
amazing
to
see
how
quickly
these
woodsmen
can
make
a
camp
each
one
knew
precisely
his
share
of
the
enterprise
one
sprang
to
chop
a
dry
spruce
log
into
fuel
for
a
quick
fire
and
fell
a
harder
tree
to
keep
us
warm
through
the
night
another
stripped
a
pile
of
boughs
from
a
balsam
for
the
beds
another
cut
the
from
a
neighbouring
thicket
another
unrolled
the
bundles
and
made
ready
the
cooking
utensils
as
if
by
magic
the
miracle
of
the
camp
was
the
bed
was
made
the
room
was
fit
by
punctual
eve
the
stars
were
lit
but
greygown
always
insists
upon
completing
that
quotation
from
stevenson
in
her
own
voice
for
this
is
the
way
it
ends
when
we
put
up
my
ass
and
i
at
god
green
caravanserai
our
permanent
camp
was
another
day
voyage
down
the
lake
on
a
beach
opposite
the
point
ausable
there
the
water
was
contracted
to
a
narrow
strait
and
in
the
swift
current
close
to
the
point
the
great
trout
had
fixed
their
from
time
immemorial
it
was
the
first
week
in
september
and
the
magnates
of
the
lake
were
already
assembling
the
common
councilmen
and
the
mayor
and
the
whole
committee
of
seventy
there
were
giants
in
that
place
rolling
lazily
about
and
chasing
each
other
on
the
surface
of
the
water
look
cried
francois
in
excitement
as
we
lay
at
anchor
in
the
gray
morning
twilight
one
like
a
horse
has
just
leaped
behind
us
i
assure
you
big
like
a
horse
but
the
fish
were
shy
and
dour
old
castonnier
the
guardian
of
the
lake
lived
in
his
hut
on
the
shore
and
flogged
the
water
early
and
late
every
day
with
his
flies
he
was
anchored
in
his
dugout
close
beside
us
and
grinned
with
delight
as
he
saw
his
trout
refuse
my
best
casts
they
are
here
for
you
can
see
them
he
said
by
way
of
discouragement
but
it
is
difficult
to
take
them
do
you
not
find
it
so
in
the
back
of
my
i
discovered
a
tiny
phantom
minnow
a
dainty
affair
of
varnished
silk
as
light
as
a
feather
and
quietly
attached
it
to
the
leader
in
place
of
the
then
the
fun
began
one
after
another
the
big
fish
dashed
at
that
deception
and
we
played
and
netted
them
until
our
score
was
thirteen
weighing
altogether
pounds
and
the
largest
five
pounds
and
a
half
the
guardian
was
mystified
and
disgusted
he
looked
on
for
a
while
in
silence
and
then
pulled
up
anchor
and
clattered
ashore
he
must
have
made
some
inquiries
and
reflections
during
the
day
for
that
night
he
paid
a
visit
to
our
camp
after
telling
bear
stories
and
fish
stories
for
an
hour
or
two
by
the
fire
he
rose
to
depart
and
tapping
his
forefinger
solemnly
upon
my
shoulder
delivered
himself
as
follows
you
can
say
a
proud
thing
when
you
go
home
that
you
have
beaten
the
old
castonnier
there
are
not
many
fishermen
who
can
say
that
but
he
added
with
confidential
emphasis
votre
sacre
poisson
qui
a
fait
cela
that
was
a
touch
of
human
nature
my
rusty
old
guardian
more
welcome
to
me
than
all
the
morning
catch
is
there
not
always
a
confounded
little
minnow
responsible
for
our
failures
did
you
ever
see
a
tumble
on
the
ice
without
stooping
immediately
to
the
strap
of
his
skates
and
would
not
ignotus
have
painted
a
masterpiece
if
he
could
have
found
good
brushes
and
a
proper
canvas
life
shortcomings
would
be
bitter
indeed
if
we
could
not
find
excuses
for
them
outside
of
ourselves
and
as
for
life
successes
well
it
is
certainly
wholesome
to
remember
how
many
of
them
are
due
to
a
fortunate
position
and
the
proper
tools
our
tent
was
on
the
border
of
a
coppice
of
young
trees
it
was
pleasant
to
be
awakened
by
a
convocation
of
birds
at
sunrise
and
to
watch
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
dance
out
upon
our
translucent
roof
of
canvas
all
the
birds
in
the
bush
are
early
but
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
every
one
can
be
rewarded
with
a
worm
here
in
canada
those
little
people
of
the
air
who
appear
as
transient
guests
of
spring
and
autumn
in
the
middle
states
are
in
their
summer
home
and
warblers
named
for
the
magnolia
and
the
myrtle
and
flutter
and
creep
along
the
branches
with
simple
lisping
music
kinglets
and
tiny
brilliant
sparks
of
life
twitter
among
the
trees
breaking
occasionally
into
clearer
sweeter
songs
companies
of
redpolls
and
crossbills
pass
chirping
through
the
thickets
busily
seeking
their
food
the
fearless
familiar
chickadee
repeats
his
name
merrily
while

leads
his
family
to
explore
every
nook

sociable
wanderers
arrive

flocks
the
canadians
call
them
recollets
because
they
wear

brown
crest
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hoods
of
the
monks
who
came
with
the
first
settlers
to
new
france
they
are
a
songless
tribe
although
their
quick
reiterated
call
as
they
take
to
flight
has
given
them
the
name
of
chatterers
the
beautiful
and
the
are
more
melodious
and
the
juncos
flitting
about
the
camp
are
as
garrulous
as
all
these
varied
notes
come
and
go
through
the
tangle
of
morning
dreams
and
now
the
noisy
is
calling
thief
thief
thief
in
the
distance
and
a
pair
of
great
pileated
woodpeckers
with
crimson
crests
are
laughing
loudly
in
the
swamp
over
some
family
joke
but
listen
what
is
that
harsh
creaking
note
it
is
the
cry
of
the
northern
shrike
of
whom
tradition
says
that
he
catches
little
birds
and
impales
them
on
sharp
thorns
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
concert
closes
suddenly
and
the
singers
vanish
into
thin
air
the
hour
of
music
is
over
the
commonplace
of
day
has
begun
and
there
is
my
lady
greygown
already
up
and
dressed
standing
by
the
and
laughing
at
my
belated
appearance
but
the
birds
were
not
our
only
musicians
at
kenogami
french
canada
is
one
of
the
ancestral
homes
of
song
here
you
can
still
listen
to
those
quaint
ballads
which
were
sung
centuries
ago
in
normandie
and
provence
a
la
claire
fontaine
dans
paris
y
brune
plus
belle
que
le

sur
le

ma
boule

and
a
hundred
other
linger
among
the
peasants
and
voyageurs
of
these
northern
woods
you
may
hear
malbrouck
guerre
mironton
mironton
mirontaine
and
isabeau
promene
le
long

son
jardin
chanted
in
the
farmhouse
or
the
lumber
shanty
to
the
tunes
which
have
come
down
from
an
unknown
source
and
never
lost
their
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
our
ferdinand
was
a
perfect
fountain
of
music
he
had
a
clear
tenor
voice
and
solaced
every
task
and
shortened
every
voyage
with
melody
a
song
ferdinand
a
jolly
song
the
other
men
would
say
as
the
canoes
went
sweeping
down
the
quiet
lake
and
then
the
leader
would
strike
up
a
air
and
his
companions
would
come
in
on
the
refrain
keeping
time
with
the
stroke
of
their
paddles
sometimes
it
would
be
a
merry
ditty
my
father
had
no
girl
but
me
and
yet
he
sent
me
off
to
sea
leap
my
little
cecilia
or
perhaps
it
was
i
danced
so
much
the
livelong
day
dance
my
sweetheart

i
fairly
danced
my
shoes
away
till
evening
dance
my
pretty
dance
once
more
dance
until
we
break
the
floor
but
more
frequently
the
song
was
touched
with
a
plaintive
pleasant
melancholy
the
minstrel
told
how
he
had
gone
into
the
woods
and
heard
the
nightingale
and
she
had
confided
to
him
that
lovers
are
often
unhappy
the
story
of
la
belle
francoise
was
repeated
in
minor
cadences
how
her
sweetheart
sailed
away
to
the
wars
and
when
he
came
back
the
village
church
bells
were
ringing
and
he
said
to
himself
that
francoise
had
been
faithless
and
the
chimes
were
for
her
marriage
but
when
he
entered
the
church
it
was
her
funeral
that
he
saw
for
she
had
died
of
love
it
is
strange
how
sorrow
charms
us
when
it
is
distant
and
visionary
even
when
we
are
happiest
we
enjoy
making
music
of
old
unhappy
things
what
is
that
song
which
you
are
singing
ferdinand
asks
the
lady
as
she
hears
him
humming
behind
her
in
the
canoe
ah
madame
it
is
the
chanson
of
a
young
man
who
demands
of
his
blonde
why
she
will
not
marry
him
he
says
that
he
has
waited
long
time
and
the
flowers
are
falling
from
the
and
he
is
very
sad
and
does
she
give
a
reason
yes
madame
that
is
to
say
a
reason
of
a
certain
sort
she
declares
that
she
is
not
quite
ready
he
must
wait
until
the
adorns
itself
again
and
what
is
the
end
do
they
get
married
at
last
but
i
do
not
know
madame
the
chanson
does
not
go
so
far
it
ceases
with
the
complaint
of
the
young
man
and
it
is
a
very
uncertain
affair
this
affair
of
the
heart
is
it
not
then
as
if
he
turned
from
such
perplexing
mysteries
to
something
plain
and
sure
and
easy
to
understand
he
breaks

the

pool
among
the
mountains
there
is
a
gorge
and
in
the
gorge
there
is
a
river
and
in
the
river
there
is
a
pool
and
in
the
pool
there
is
an
island
and
on
the
island
for
four
happy
days
there
was
a
camp
it
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
to
establish
ourselves
in
that
lonely
place
the
river
though
not
remote
from
civilisation
is
practically
inaccessible
for
nine
miles
of
its
course
by
reason
of
the
steepness
of
its
banks
which
are
long
shaggy
precipices
and
the
fury
of
its
current
in
which
no
boat
can
live
we
heard
its
voice
as
we
approached
through
the
forest
and
could
hardly
tell
whether
it
was
far
away
or
near
there
is
a
perspective
of
sound
as
well
as
of
sight
and
one
must
have
some
idea
of
the
size
of
a
noise
before
one
can
judge
of
its
distance
a
mosquito
horn
in
a
dark
room
may
seem
like
a
trumpet
on
the
battlements
and
the
tumult
of
a
mighty
stream
heard
through
an
unknown
stretch
of
woods
may
appear
like
the
babble
of
a
mountain
brook
close
at
hand
but
when
we
came
out
upon
the
bald
forehead
of
a
burnt
cliff
and
looked
down
we
realised
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
the
unseen
voice
that
we
had
been
following
a
river
of
splendid
strength
went
leaping
through
the
chasm
five
hundred
feet
below
us
and
at
the
foot
of
two
falls
in
an
oval
of
dark
topaz
water
traced
with
curves
of
floating
foam
lay
the
solitary
island
the
broken
path
was
like
a
ladder
how
shall
we
ever
get
down
sighed
greygown
as
we
dropped
from
rock
to
rock
and
at
the
bottom
she
looked
up
sighing
i
know
we
never
can
get
back
again
there
was
not
a
foot
of
ground
on
the
shores
level
enough
for
a
tent
our
canoe
ferried
us
over
two
at
a
time
to
the
island
it
was
about
a
hundred
paces
long
composed
of
round
coggly
stones
with
just
one
patch
of
smooth
sand
at
the
lower
end
there
was
not
a
tree
left
upon
it
larger
than
an
the
must
be
cut
far
up
on
the
and
every
bough
for
our
beds
must
be
carried
down
the
ladder
of
rocks
but
the
men
were
gay
at
their
work
singing
like
after
all
the
glow
of
life
comes
from
friction
with
its
difficulties
if
we
can
not
find
them
at
home
we
sally
abroad
and
create
them
just
to
warm
up
our
mettle
the

we
stood
on
the
at
the
upper
end
and
cast
our
little
flies
across
the
sweeping
stream
and
for
three
days
the
fish
came
crowding
in
to
fill
the
barrel
of

the

rose

we
may
call
him
six
for
if
it
had
been
that
we
had
caught
him
he
would
certainly
have
gained
the
other
ounce
and
yet
why
should
i
repeat
the
folly
of
writing
down
the
record
of
that
marvellous
catch
we
always
do
it

know
that
it
is
a
vain
thing

listen
to
the

humphry
davy
mock
and
jeer
unfeignedly
at
the
fish
stories
of
that
most
reputable
writer
but
on
the
very
next
page
old
christopher
himself
meanders
on
into
a
perilous
narrative
of
the
day
when
he
caught
a
whole
of
trout
in
a
highland
loch
incorrigible
happy
inconsistency
slow
to
believe
others
and
full
of
sceptical
inquiry
fond
man
never
doubts
one
thing
that
somewhere
in
the
world
a
tribe
of
gentle
readers
will
be
discovered
to
whom
his
fish
stories
will
appear
credible
one
of
our
days
on
the
island
was
sunday
a
day
of
rest
in
a
week
of
idleness
we
had
a
few
books
for
there
are
some
in
existence
which
will
stand
the
test
of
being
brought
into
close
contact
with
nature
are
not
john
burroughs
cheerful
kindly
essays
full
of
woodland
truth
and
companionship
can
you
not
carry
a
whole
library
of
musical
philosophy
in
your
pocket
in
matthew
arnold
volume
of
selections
from
wordsworth
and
could
there
be
a
better
sermon
for
a
sabbath
in
the
wilderness
than
slosson
immortal
story
of
fishin
jimmy
but
to
be
very
frank
about
the
matter
the
camp
is
not
stimulating
to
the
studious
side
of
my
mind
charles
lamb
as
usual
has
said
what
i
feel
i
am
not
much
a
friend
to
reading
i
can
not
settle
my
spirits
to
it
there
are
blueberries
growing
abundantly
among
the
rocks
huge
clusters
of
them
bloomy
and
luscious
as
the
grapes
of
eshcol
the
blueberry
is
nature
compensation
for
the
ruin
of
forest
fires
it
grows
best
where
the
woods
have
been
burned
away
and
the
soil
is
too
poor
to
raise
another
crop
of
trees
surely
it
is
an
innocent
and
harmless
pleasure
to
wander
along
the
hillsides
gathering
these
wild
fruits
as
the
master
and
his
disciples
once
walked
through
the
fields
and
plucked
the
ears
of
corn
never
caring
what
the
pharisees
thought
of
that
new
way
of
keeping
the
sabbath
and
here
is
a
bed
of
moss
beside
a
dashing
rivulet
inviting
us
to
rest
and
be
thankful
hark
there
is
a
sparrow
on
a
little
tree
across
the
river
whistling
his
afternoon
song
in
linked
sweetness
long
drawn
out
down
in
maine
they
call
him
the
because
his
notes
sound
to
them
like
old
man
peabody
peabody
peabody
in
new
brunswick
the
scotch
settlers
say
that
he
sings
lost
lost
kennedy
kennedy
kennedy
but
here
in
his
northern
home
i
think
we
can
understand
him
better
he
is
singing
again
and
again
with
a
cadence
that
never
wearies
sweet
sweet
canada
canada
canada
the
canadians
when
they
came
across
the
sea
remembering
the
nightingale
of
southern
france
baptised
this
little
gray
minstrel
their
rossignol
and
the
country
ballads
are
full
of
his
praise
every
land
has
its
nightingale
if
we
only
have
the
heart
to
hear
him
how
distinct
his
voice
is
how
personal
how
confidential
as
if
he
had
a
message
for
us
there
is
a
breath
of
fragrance
on
the
cool
shady
air
beside
our
little
stream
that
seems
familiar
it
is
the
first
week
of
september
can
it
be
that
the
of
june
the
delicate
linnaea
borealis
is
blooming
again
yes
here
is
the
threadlike
stem
lifting
its
two
frail
pink
bells
above
the
bed
of
shining
leaves
how
dear
an
early
flower
seems
when
it
comes
back
again
and
unfolds
its
beauty
in
a
summer
how
delicate
and
suggestive
is
the
faint
magical
odour
it
is
like
a
renewal
of
the
dreams
of
youth
and
need
we
ever
grow
old
asked
my
lady
greygown
as
she
sat
that
evening
with
the
on
her
breast
watching
the
stars
come
out
along
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
and
tremble
on
the
hurrying
tide
of
the
river
must
we
grow
old
as
well
as
gray
is
the
time
coming
when
all
life
will
be
commonplace
and
practical
and
governed
by
a
dull
course
shall
we
not
always
find
adventures
and
romances
and
a
few
blossoms
returning
even
when
the
season
grows
late
at
least
i
answered
let
us
believe
in
the
possibility
for
to
doubt
it
is
to
destroy
it
if
we
can
only
come
back
to
nature
together
every
year
and
consider
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
confess
our
faults
and
mistakes
and
our
unbelief
under
these
silent
stars
and
hear
the
river
murmuring
our
absolution
we
shall
die
young
even
though
we
live
long
we
shall
have
a
treasure
of
memories
which
will
be
like
the
always
a
double
blossom
on
a
single
stem
and
carry
with
us
into
the
unseen
world
something
which
will
make
it
worth
while
to
be
immortal
a
song
after
sundown
there
no
music
like
a
little
river
it
plays
the
same
tune
and
that
the
favourite
over
and
over
again
and
yet
does
not
weary
of
it
like
men
fiddlers
it
takes
the
mind
out
of
doors
and
though
we
should
be
grateful
for
good
houses
there
is
after
all
no
house
like
and
lastly
sir
it
quiets
a
man
down
like
saying
his
prayers
robert
louis
stevenson
prince
otto
the
of
the
veery
the
moonbeams
over
arno
vale
in
silver
flood
were
pouring
when
first
i
heard
the
nightingale
a
love
deploring
so
passionate
so
full
of
pain
it
sounded
strange
and
eerie
i
longed
to
hear
a
simpler
strain
the
of
the
veery
the
laverock
sings
a
bonny
lay
above
the
scottish
heather
it
sprinkles
from
the
dome
of
day
like
light
and
love
together
he
drops
the
golden
notes
to
greet
his
brooding
mate
his
dearie
i
only
know
one
song
more
sweet
the
vespers
of
the
veery
in
english
gardens
green
and
bright
and
rich
in
fruity
treasure
heard
the
blackbird
with
delight
repeat
his
merry
measure
the
ballad
was
a
lively
one
the
tune
was
loud
and
cheery
and
yet
with
every
setting
sun
i
listened
for
the
veery
o
far
away
and
far
away
the
tawny
thrush
is
singing
new
england
woods
at
close
of
day
with
that
clear
chant
are
ringing
and
when
my
light
of
life
is
low
and
heart
and
flesh
are
weary
i
fain
would
hear
before
i
go
the
of
the
veery
