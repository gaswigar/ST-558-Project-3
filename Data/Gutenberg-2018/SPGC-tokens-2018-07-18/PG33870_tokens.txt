preface
was
first
published
thirteen
years
ago
since
then
there
have
appeared
at
different
times
a
number
of
articles
dealing
with
the
hypermodern
theory
those
who
have
read
the
articles
may
well
have
thought
that
something
new
of
vital
importance
had
been
discovered
the
fact
is
that
the
hypermodern
theory
is
merely
the
application
during
the
opening
stages
generally
of
the
same
old
principles
through
the
medium
of
somewhat
new
tactics
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
fundamentals
the
change
has
been
only
a
change
of
form
and
not
always
for
the
best
at
that
in
chess
the
tactics
may
change
but
the
strategic
fundamental
principles
are
always
the
same
so
that
is
as
good
now
as
it
was
thirteen
years
ago
it
will
be
as
good
a
hundred
years
from
now
as
long
in
fact
as
the
laws
and
rules
of
the
game
remain
what
they
are
at
present
the
reader
may
therefore
go
over
the
contents
of
the
book
with
the
assurance
that
there
is
in
it
everything
he
needs
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
added
and
nothing
to
be
changed
was
the
one
standard
work
of
its
kind
thirteen
years
ago
and
the
author
firmly
believes
that
it
is

one

first
principles
endings
and
openings
the
first
thing
a
student
should
do
is
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
power
of
the
pieces
this
can
best
be
done
by
learning
how
to
accomplish
quickly
some
of
the
simple
mates
some
simple
mates
example
the
ending
rook
and
king
against
king
principle
is
to
drive
the
opposing
king
to
the
last
line
on
any
side
of
the
illustration
in
this
position
the
power
of
the
rook
is
demonstrated
by
the
first
move
r
r
which
immediately
confines
the
black
king
to
the
last
rank
and
the
mate
is
quickly
accomplished
by
r
r
k
kt
k
kt
the
combined
action
of
king
and
rook
is
needed
to
arrive
at
a
position
in
which
mate
can
be
forced
the
general
principle
for
a
beginner
to
follow
is
to
his
king
as
much
as
possible
on
the
same
rank
or
as
in
this
case
file
as
the
opposing
when
in
this
case
the
king
has
been
brought
to
the
sixth
rank
it
is
better
to
place
it
not
on
the
same
file
but
on
the
one
next
to
it
towards
the
centre
k
b
k
b
k
k
k
k
k
q
k
q
k
b
k
q
not
k
b
because
then
the
black
king
will
go
back
to
q
and
it
will
take
much
longer
to
mate
if
now
the
king
moves
back
to
q
r
r
mates
at
once
k
kt
r
q
b
k
r
k

k
kt
k
kt
k
r
r
b
mate
it
has
taken
exactly
ten
moves
to
mate
from
the
original
position
on
move
black
could
have
played
k
k
and
according
to
principle
white
would
have
continued
k
q
k
b
the
black
king
will
ultimately
be
forced
to
move
in
front
of
the
white
king
and
be
mated
by
r
r
k
k

r

kt
r
r
mate
example
illustration
since
the
black
king
is
in
the
centre
of
the
board
the
best
way
to
proceed
is
to
advance
your
own
king
thus
k
k
k
q
k
k
as
the
rook
has
not
yet
come
into
play
it
is
better
to
advance
the
king
straight
into
the
centre
of
the
board
not
in
front
but
to
one
side
of
the
other
king
should
now
the
black
king
move
to
k
the
rook
drives
it
back
by
r
r
ch
on
the
other
hand
if
k
b
instead
then
also
r
r
if
now
k
kt
there
follows
k
q
but
if
instead
k
b
then
r
r
keeping
the
king
confined
to
as
few
squares
as
possible
now
the
ending
may
continue
k
b
r
b
ch
k
kt
k
q
k
kt
r
kt
ch
k
r
k
b
k
r
it
should
be
noticed
how
often
the
white
king
has
moved
next
to
the
rook
not
only
to
defend
it
but
also
to
reduce
the
mobility
of
the
opposing
king
now
white
mates
in
three
moves
thus
r
r
ch
k
kt
r
any
square
on
the
rook
file
forcing
the
black
king
in
front
of
the
white
k
b
r
r
mate
it
has
taken
eleven
moves
to
mate
and
under
any
conditions
i
believe
it
should
be
done
in
under
twenty
while
it
may
be
monotonous
it
is
worth
while
for
the
beginner
to
practice
such
things
as
it
will
teach
him
the
proper
handling
of
his
pieces
example
now
we
come
to
two
bishops
and
king
against
king
illustration
since
the
black
king
is
in
the
corner
white
can
play
b
q
k
kt
b
k
kt
k
b
b
b
and
already
the
black
king
is
confined
to
a
few
squares
if
the
black
king
in
the
original
position
had
been
in
the
centre
of
the
board
or
away
from
the
last
row
white
should
have
advanced
his
king
and
then
with
the
aid
of
his
bishops
restricted
the
black
king
movements
to
as
few
squares
as
possible
we
might
now
continue
k
kt
k
b
in
this
ending
the
black
king
must
not
only
be
driven
to
the
edge
of
the
board
but
he
must
also
be
forced
into
a
corner
and
before
a
mate
can
be
given
the
white
king
must
be
brought
to
the
sixth
rank
and
at
the
same
time
in
one
of
the
last
two
files
in
this
case
either
k
r
k
kt
k
b
k
b
and
as
k
r
and
k
kt
are
the
nearest
squares
it
is
to
either
of
these
squares
that
the
king
ought
to
go

k
kt
k
kt
k

k
b
k

k

k
kt
k

white
must
now
mark
time
and
move
one
of
the
bishops
so
as
to
force
the
black
king
to
go
back
b
r
k
kt
b
k
k
r
now
the
white
bishop
must
take
up
a
position
from
which
it
can
give

along
the
white
diagonal
when
the

king
moves

mate
it
has
taken
fourteen
moves
to
force
the
mate
and
in
any
position
it
should
be
done
in
under
thirty
in
all
endings
of
this
kind
care
must
be
taken
not
to
drift
into
a
stale
mate
in
this
particular
ending
one
should
remember
that
the
king
must
not
only
be
driven
to
the
edge
of
the
board
but
also
into
a
corner
in
all
such
endings
however
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
king
is
forced
on
to
the
last
rank
or
to
an
outside
file
k
r
or
q
r
k
or
q
example
we
now
come
to
queen
and
king
against
king
as
the
queen
combines
the
power
of
the
rook
and
the
bishop
it
is
the
easiest
mate
of
all
and
should
always
be
accomplished
in
under
ten
moves
take
the
following
position
illustration
a
good
way
to
begin
is
to
make
the
first
move
with
the
queen
trying
to
limit
the
black
king
mobility
as
much
as
possible
thus
q
b
k
q
k
q
already
the
black
king
has
only
one
available
square
k
k
k
k
k
b
q
q
k
kt
should
black
play
k
kt
then
q
kt
ch
q
k
k
r
if
k
r
k
b
and
mate
next
move
q
k
kt
k
r
k
b
k
moves
q
mates
in
this
ending
as
in
the
case
of
the
rook
the
black
king
must
be
forced
to
the
edge
of
the
board
only
the
queen
being
so
much
more
powerful
than
the
rook
the
process
is
far
easier
and
shorter
these
are
the
three
elementary
endings
and
in
all
of
these
the
principle
is
the
same
in
each
case
the
of
the
king
is
needed
in
order
to
force
a
mate
without
the
aid
of
the
king
at
least
two
rooks
are
required
pawn
promotion
the
gain
of
a
pawn
is
the
smallest
material
advantage
that
can
be
obtained
in
a
game
and
it
often
is
sufficient
to
win
even
when
the
pawn
is
the
only
remaining
unit
apart
from
the
kings
it
is
essential
speaking
generally
that
king
should
be
in
front
of
his
pawn
with
at
least
one
intervening
if
the
opposing
king
is
directly
in
front
of
the
pawn
then
the
game
can
not
be
won
this
can
best
be
explained
by
the
following
examples
example
illustration
the
position
is
drawn
and
the
way
to
proceed
is
for
black
to
keep
the
king
always
directly
in
front
of
the
pawn
and
when
it
can
not
be
done
as
for
instance
in
this
position
because
of
the
white
king
then
the
black
king
must
be
kept
in
front
of
the
white
king
the
play
would
proceed
thus
p
k
k
k
k
q
k
q
this
is
a
very
important
move
any
other
move
would
lose
as
will
be
shown
later
as
the
black
king
can
not
be
kept
close
up
to
the
pawn
it
must
be
brought
as
far
forward
as
possible
and
at
the
same
time
in
front
of
the
white
king
p
k
ch
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
b
k
b
again
the
same
case
as
the
white
king
comes
up
the
black
king
must
be
kept
in
front
of
it
since
it
can
not
be
brought
up
to
the
pawn
p
k
ch
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
q
k
q
p
k
ch
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
q
k
q
if
now
white
advances
the
pawn
the
black
king
gets
in
front
of
it
and
white
must
either
give
up
the
pawn
or
play
k
k
and
a
stale
mate
results
if
instead
of
advancing
the
pawn
white
withdraws
his
king
black
brings
his
king
up
to
the
pawn
and
when
forced
to
go
back
he
moves
to
k
of
the
pawn
ready
to
come
up
again
or
to
move
in
front
of
the
white
king
as
before
should
the
latter
advance
the
whole
mode
of
procedure
is
very
important
and
the
student
should
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
its
details
for
it
involves
principles
to
be
taken
up
later
on
and
because
many
a
beginner
has
lost
identical
positions
from
lack
of
proper
knowledge
at
this
stage
of
the
book
i
can
not
lay
too
much
stress
on
its
importance
example
in
this
position
white
wins
as
the
king
is
in
front
of
his
pawn
and
there
is
one
intervening
square
illustration
the
method
to
follow
is
to
the
king
as
far
as
is
compatible
with
the
safety
of
the
pawn
and
never
to
advance
the
pawn
until
it
is
essential
to
its
own
thus
k
k
k
k
black
does
not
allow
the
white
king
to
advance
therefore
white
is
now
compelled
to
advance
his
pawn
so
as
to
force
black
to
move
away
he
is
then
able
to
advance
his
own
king
p
k
b
k
q
k
k
if
black
had
played
k
b
then
white
would
be
forced
to
advance
the
pawn
to
k
since
he
could
not
advance
his
king
without
leaving
black
the
opportunity
to
play
k
k
winning
the
pawn
since
he
has
not
done
so
it
is
better
for
white
not
to
advance
the
pawn
yet
since
its
own
safety
does
not
require
it
but
to
try
to
bring
the
king
still
further
forward
thus
k
k
k
q
k
b
k
k
now
the
white
pawn
is
too
far
back
and
it
may
be
brought
up
within
protection
of
the
king
p
k
k
q
now
it
would
not
do
to
play
k
b
because
black
would
play
k
q
and
white
would
have
to
bring
back
his
king
to
protect
the
pawn
therefore
he
must
continue
p
k
k
k
had
he
moved
anywhere
else
white
could
have
played
k
b
followed
by
the
advance
of
the
pawn
to
k
k
k
all
these
squares
being
protected
by
the
king
as
black
tries
to
prevent
that
white
must
now
force
him
to
move
away
at
the
same
time
always
keeping
the
king
in
front
of
the
pawn
thus
k
k
p
k
would
make
it
a
draw
as
black
would
then
play
k
b
and
we
would
have
a
position
similar
to
the
one
explained
in
connection
with
example
k
b
k
q
king
moves
and
the
white
pawn
advances
to
k
becomes
a
queen
and
it
is
all
over
this
ending
is
like
the
previous
one
and
for
the
same
reasons
should
be
thoroughly
understood
before
proceeding
any
further
pawn
endings
i
shall
now
give
a
couple
of
simple
endings
of
two
pawns
against
one
or
three
against
two
that
the
reader
may
see
how
they
can
be
won
fewer
explanations
will
be
given
as
it
is
up
to
the
student
to
work
things
out
for
himself
furthermore
nobody
can
learn
how
to
play
well
merely
from
the
study
of
a
book
it
can
only
serve
as
a
guide
and
the
rest
must
be
done
by
the
teacher
if
the
student
has
one
if
not
the
student
must
realise
by
long
and
bitter
experience
the
practical
application
of
the
many
things
explained
in
the
book

the

the
enormous

when

are
hardly
any
pieces
left
when
playing
against
an
adversary
who
knows
how
to
use
the
resources
at
his
disposal
and
it
should
show
the
student
also
the
necessity
of
paying
strict
attention
to
these
elementary
things
which
form
the
basis
of
true
mastership
in
chess
example
in
this
ending
illustration
white
can
win
by
advancing
any
of
the
three
pawns
on
the
first
move
but
it
is
convenient
to
follow
the
general
rule
whenever
there
is
no
good
reason
against
it
of
the
pawn
that
has
no
pawn
opposing
thus
we
begin
by
p
b
k
k
if
p
kt
p
b
and
we
have
a
similar
ending
to
one
of

p

and
in

we
have
a
similar
ending
to
one
of
those
already
shown
p
r
and
by
following
it
up
with
p
kt
we
have
the
same
ending
previously
shown
should
black
play
p
kt
then
r
p
p
p
p
p
b
ch
with
the
same
result
having
now
seen
the
cases
when
the
pawns
are
all
on
one
side
of
the
board
we
shall
now
examine
a
case
when
there
are
pawns
on
both
sides
of
the
board
example
in
these
cases
the
general
rule
is
to
immediately
on
the
side
where
you
have
the
superior
thus
we
have
illustration
p
k
kt
it
is
generally
advisable
to
advance
the
pawn
that
is
free
from
opposition
p
q
r
black
makes
an
advance
on
the
other
side
and
now
white
considers
whether
or
not
he
should
stop
the
advance
in
this
case
either
way
wins
but
generally
the
advance
should
be
stopped
when
the
opposing
king
is
far
away
p
q
r
k
b
p
r
k
k
if
k
kt
then
simple
counting
will
show
that
white
goes
to
the
other
side
with
his
king
wins
the
p
at
q
r
and
then
queens
his
single
pawn
long
before
black
can
do
the
same
p
kt
k
b
k
b
k
kt
p
r
k
b
if
p
r
p
kt
and
then
the
two
pawns
defend
themselves
and
white
can
go
to
the
other
side
with
his
king
to
win
the
other
pawn
k
k
now
it
is
time
to
go
to
the
other
side
with
the
king
win
the
black
pawn
and
queen
the
single
pawn
this
is
typical
of
all
such
endings
and
should
be
worked
out
by
the
student
in
this
case
and
in
similar
cases
which
he
can
put
up
some
winning
positions
in
the
by
the
time
the
student
has
digested
all
that
has
been
previously
explained
he
no
doubt
is
anxious
to
get
to
the
actual
game
and
play
with
all
the
pieces
however
before
considering
the
openings
we
shall
devote
a
little
time
to
some
combinations
that
often
arise
during
the
game
and
which
will
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
game
once
he
becomes
better
acquainted
with
it
example
illustration
it
is
black

thinking
that
white
merely
threatens
to
play

to
mate

black
plays

threatening

by
way

white

real
and

effective
threat
viz

this

type
of
combination
may
come
as
the
result
of
a
somewhat
more
complicated
position
example

white
is
a
piece
behind

unless

can
win
it
back

he
will

this
combination
is
rather
long
and
has
many
variations
therefore
a
beginner
will
hardly
be
able
to
fathom
it
but
knowing
the
type
of
combination
he
might
under
similar
circumstances
undertake
and
carry
out
a
brilliant
attack
which
he
would
otherwise
never
think
of
it
will
be
seen
that
all
the
combinations
shown
have
for
a
foundation
the
proper
of
the
pieces
which
have
all
been
brought
to
bear
against
a
weak
point
relative
value
of
the
pieces
before
going
on
to
the
general
principles
of
the
openings
it
is
advisable
to
give
the
student
an
idea
of
the
proper
relative
value
of
the
pieces
there
is
no
complete
and
accurate
table
for
all
of
them
and
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
compare
the
pieces
separately
for
all
general
theoretical
purposes
the
bishop
and
the
knight
have
to
be
considered
as
of
the
same
value
though
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
bishop
will
prove
the
more
valuable
piece
in
most
cases
and
it
is
well
known
that
two
bishops
are
almost
always
better
than
two
knights
the
bishop
will
be
stronger
against
pawns
than
the
knight
and
in
combination
with
pawns
will
also
be
stronger
against
the
rook
than
the
knight
will
be
a
bishop
and
a
rook
are
also
stronger
than
a
knight
and
a
rook
but
a
queen
and
a
knight
may
be
stronger
than
a
queen
and
a
bishop
a
bishop
will
often
be
worth
more
than
three
pawns
but
a
knight
very
seldom
so
and
may
even
not
be
worth
so
much
a
rook
will
be
worth
a
knight
and
two
pawns
or
a
bishop
and
two
pawns
but
as
said
before
the
bishop
will
be
a
better
piece
against
the
rook
two
rooks
are
slightly
stronger
than
a
queen
they
are
slightly
weaker
than
two
knights
and
a
bishop
and
a
little
more
so
than
two
bishops
and
a
knight
the
power
of
the
knight
decreases
as
the
pieces
are
changed
off
the
power
of
the
rook
on
the
contrary
increases
the
king
a
purely
piece
throughout
the
becomes
an
piece
once
all
the
pieces
are
off
the
board
and
sometimes
even
when
there
are
one
or
two
minor
pieces
left
the
handling
of
the
king
becomes
of
paramount
importance
once
the
stage
is
reached
general
strategy
of
the
opening
the
main
thing
is
to
the
pieces
get
them
into
play
as
fast
as
you
can
from
the
outset
two
moves
p
k
or
p
q
open
up
lines
for
the
queen
and
a
bishop
therefore
theoretically
one
of
these
two
moves
must
be
the
best
as
no
other
first
move
accomplishes
so
much
example
suppose
we
begin
p
k
p
k
kt
k
b
this
is
both
an
attacking
and
a
developing
move
black
can
now
either
reply
with
the
identical
move
or
play
kt
q
b
this
developing
move
at
the
same
time
defends
the
king
pawn
kt
b
kt
b
these
moves
are
of
a
purely
developing
nature
b
kt
is
generally
advisable
not
to
bring
this
bishop
out
until
one
knight
is
preferably
the
king
knight
the
bishop
could
also
have
been
played
to
b
but
it
is
advisable
whenever
possible
to
combine
development
and
attack
b
kt
black
replies
in
the
same
manner
threatening
a
possible
exchange
of
bishop
for
knight
with
kt
p
to
follow
o
o
an
indirect
way
of
preventing
b
kt
which
more
experience
or
study
will
show
to
be
bad
at
the
same
time
rook
is
brought
into
action
in
the
centre
a
very
important
o
o
black
follows
the
same
line
of
reasoning
p
q
p
q
these
moves
have
a
object
viz
to
protect
the
king
pawn
and
to
open
the
diagonal
for
the
development
of
the
queen
bishop
b
kt
illustration
a
very
powerful
move
which
brings
us
to
the
stage
as
there
is
already
in
view
a
combination
to
win
quickly
by
kt
q
this
threat
makes
it
impossible
for
black
to
continue
the
same
course
there
is
a
long
analysis
showing
that
black
should
lose
if
he
also
plays
b
kt
he
is
now
forced
to
play
b
kt
as
experience
has
shown
thus
bringing
up
to
notice
three
things
first
the
complete
development
of
the
opening
has
taken
only
seven
moves
this
varies
up
to
ten
or
twelve
moves
in
some
very
exceptional
cases
as
a
rule
eight
should
be
enough
second
black
has
been
compelled
to
exchange
a
bishop
for
a
knight
but
as
a
compensation
he
has
isolated
white
q
r
p
and
doubled
a
pawn
this
at
such
an
early
stage
of
the
game
is
rather
an
advantage
for
white
as
the
pawn
is
doubled
towards
the
centre
of
the
board
third
white
by
the
exchange
brings
up
a
pawn
to
control
the
square
q
puts
black
on
the
defensive
as
experience
will
show
and
thus
keeps
an
unquestionable
advantage
the
strategical
principles
expounded
above
are
the
same
for
all
the
openings
only
their
tactical
application
varies
according
to
the
circumstances
before
proceeding
further
i
wish
to
lay
stress
on
the
following
point
which
the
student
should
bear
in
mind
development
has
been
completed
no
piece
should
be
moved
more
than
once
unless
it
is
essential
in
order
to
obtain
either
material
advantage
or
to
secure
freedom
of
the
beginner
would
do
well
to
remember
this
as
well
as
what
has
already
been
stated
out
the
knights
before
bringing
out
the
control
of
the
centre
the
four
squares
k
and
q
on
each
side
respectively
are
the
centre
squares
and
control
of
these
squares
is
called
control
of
the
centre
control
of
the
centre
is
of
great
no
violent
attack
can
succeed
without
controlling
at
least
two
of
these
squares
and
possibly
three
many
a
manoeuvre
in
the
opening
has
for
its
sole
object
the
control
of
the
centre
which
invariably
ensures
the
initiative
it
is
well
always
to
bear
this
in
mind
since
it
will
often
be
the
reason
of
a
series
of
moves
which
could
not
otherwise
be
properly
understood
as
this
book
progresses
i
shall
dwell
more
fully
on
these
different
points
at
present
i
shall
devote
some
time
to
openings
taken
at
random
and
explain
the
moves
according
to
general
principles
the
student
will
in
that
way
train
his
mind
in
the
proper
direction
and
will
thus
have
less
trouble
in
finding
a
way
out
when
confronted
with
a
new
and
difficult
situation
example
p
k
p
k
kt
k
b
p
q
a
timid
move
black
assumes
a
defensive
attitude
at
once
on
principle
the
move
is
wrong
in
the
openings
whenever
possible
should
be
moved
in
preference
to
p
q
white
takes
the
offensive
immediately
and
strives
to
control
the
centre
so
as
to
have
ample
room
to
deploy
his
forces
kt
q
black
does
not
wish
to
relinquish
the
centre
and
also
prefers
the
text
move
to
kt
q
b
which
would
be
the
more
natural
square
for
the
kt
but
on
principle
the
move
is
wrong
because
it
blocks
the
action
of
the
queen
bishop
and
instead
of
facilitating
the
action
of
black
pieces
tends
on
the
contrary
to
cramp
them
b
q
b
p
k
r
black
is
forced
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
previous
move
such
a
move
on
black
part
condemns
by
itself
any
form
of
opening
that
makes
it
necessary
white
threatened
kt
kt
and
black
could
not
stop
it
with
b
k
because
of
p
p
kt
p
if
p
p
q

has
besides
a
perfectly
safe
position
kt

b

k
q
k
it
should
be
noticed
that

with

white
completes

development
while

hampered
a
simple
examination
will
suffice
to
show
that
white
position
is
unassailable
there
are
no
weak
spots
in
his
armour

his
pieces
are
ready
for
any
manoeuvre

further
principles
in
play
we
shall
now
go
back
to
the
endings
in
search
of
a
few
more
principles
then
again
to
the
and
finally
to
the
openings
once
more
so
that
the
advance
may
not
only
be
gradual
but
homogeneous
in
this
way
the
foundation
on
which
we
expect
to
build
the
structure
will
be
firm
and
solid
a
cardinal
principle
illustration
in
the
position
shown
above
white
can
draw
by
playing
p
kt
according
to
the
general
rule
that
governs
such
cases
advance
the
pawn
that
is
free
from
but
suppose
that
white
either
because
he
does
not
know
this
principle
or
because
he
does
not
in
this
case
sufficiently
appreciate
the
value
of
its
application
suppose
we
say
that
he
plays
p
q
r
then
black
can
win
by
playing
p
q
r
applying
one
of
the
cardinal
principles
of
the
high
strategy
of
chess
unit
that
holds
in
this
case
one
pawn
would
hold
two
of
the
opponent
pawns
the
student
can
not
lay
too
much
stress
on
this
principle
it
can
be
applied
in
many
ways
and
it
constitutes
one
of
the
principal
weapons
in
the
hands
of
a
master
example
the
example
given
should
be
sufficient

this
brings
the
game
to
a
position
which
is
won
by
black
and
which
constitutes
one
of
the
classical
endings
of
king
and
pawns
i
shall
try
to
explain
the
guiding
idea
of
it
to
those
not
familiar
with
it
a
classical
ending
illustration
example
in
this
position
white
best
line
of
defence
consists
in
keeping
his
pawn
where
it
stands
at
r
as
soon
as
the
pawn
is
advanced
it
becomes
easier
for
black
to
win
on
the
other
hand
black
plan
to
win
supposing
that
white
does
not
advance
his
pawn
may
be
divided
into
three
parts
the
first
part
will
be
to
get
his
king
to
k
r
at
the
same
time
keeping
intact
the
position
of
his
pawns
this
is
all
important
since
in
order
to
win
the
game
it
is
essential
at
the
end
that
black
may
be
able
to
advance
his
rearmost
pawn
one
or
two
squares
according
to
the
position
of
the
white
king

will
consist
in
advancing

up
the
k

this
ends
the
second
part
illustration
the
third
part
will
consist
in
timing
the
advance
of
the
kt
p
so
as
to
play
p
kt
when
the
white
king
is
at
r
it
now
becomes
evident
how
necessary
it
is
to
be
able
to
move
the
kt
p
either
one
or
two
squares
according
to
the
position
of
the
white
king
as
indicated
previously
in
this
case
as
it
is
white
move
the
pawn
will
be
advanced
two
squares
since
the
white
king
will
be
in
the
corner
but
if
it
were
now
black
move
the
kt
p
should
only
be
advanced
one
square
since
the
white
king
is
at

and
wins
it
is
in
this
analytical
way
that
the
student
should
try
to
learn
he
will
thus
train
his
mind
to
follow
a
logical
sequence
in
reasoning
out
any
position
this
example
is
excellent
training
since
it
is
easy
to
divide
it
into
three
stages
and
to
explain
the
main
point
of
each
part
the
next
subject
we
shall
study
is
the
simple
opposition
but
before
we
devote
our
time
to
it
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
two
things
obtaining
a
passed
pawn
when
three
or
more
pawns
are
opposed
to
each
other
in
some
such
position
as
the
one
in
example
there
is
always
a
chance
for
one
side
or
the
other
of
obtaining
a
passed
pawn
illustration
example
in
the
above
position
the
way
of
obtaining
a
passed
pawn
is
to
advance
the
centre
pawn
p
kt
r
p
p
if
b
p
p
p
r
p
b
p
b
p
p
r
and
as
in
this
case
the
white
pawn
is
nearer
to
queen
than
any
of
the
black
pawns
white
will
win
now
if
it
had
been
black
move
black
could
play
p
kt
b
p
p
b
p
p
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
try
to
obtain
a
passed
pawn
because
the
white
pawns
would
be
nearer
to
queen
than
the
single
black
pawn
p
p
p
p
and
the
game
properly
played
would
be
a
draw
the
student
should
work
this
out
for
himself
how
to
find
out
which
pawn
will
be
first
to
queen
when
two
pawns
are
free
or
will
be
free
to
advance
to
queen
you
can
find
out
by
counting
which
pawn
will
be
the
first
to
succeed
example
in
this
position
whoever
moves
first
wins
illustration
the
first
thing
is
to
find
out
by
counting
whether
the
opposing
king
can
be
in
time
to
stop
the
passed
pawn
from
queening
when
as
in
this
case
it
can
not
be
done
the
point
is
to
count
which
pawn
comes
in
first
in
this
case
the
time
is
the
same
but
the
pawn
that
reaches
the
eighth
square
first
and
becomes
a
queen
is
in
a
position
to
capture
the
adversary
queen
when
he
makes
one
thus
p
r
p
k
r
p
r
p
r
p
kt
p
p
now
comes
a
little
calculation
white
can
capture
the
pawn
but
if
he
does
so
he
will
not
when
queening
command
the
square
where
black
will
also
queen
his
pawn
therefore
instead
of
taking
he
plays
p
r
p
r
p
r
p
r
p
r
q
and
wins
the
student
would
do
well
to
acquaint
himself
with
various
simple
endings
of
this
sort
so
as
to
acquire
the
habit
of
counting
and
thus
be
able
to
know
with
ease
when
he
can
or
can
not
get
there
first
once
again
i
must
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
book
can
not
by
itself
teach
how
to
play
it
can
only
serve
as
a
guide
and
the
rest
must
be
learned
by
experience
and
if
a
teacher
can
be
had
at
the
same
time
so
much
the
faster
will
the
student
be
able
to
learn
the
opposition
when
kings
have
to
be
moved
and
one
player
can
by
force
bring
his
king
into
a
position
similar
to
the
one
shown
in
the
following
diagram
so
that
his
adversary
is
forced
to
move
and
make
way
for
him
the
player
obtaining
that
advantage
is
said
to
have
illustration
example
suppose
in
the
above
position
white
plays
k
q
now
black
has
the
option
of
either
opposing
the
passage
of
the
white
king
by
playing
k
q
or
if
he
prefers
he
can
with
his
own
king
by
replying
k
b
notice
that
the
kings
are
directly
opposed
to
each
other
and
the
number
of
intervening
squares
between
them
is
odd
one
in
this
case
the
opposition
can
take
the
form
shown
above
which
can
be
called
actual
or
close
frontal
opposition
or
this
form
illustration
which
can
be
called
actual
or
close
diagonal
opposition
or
again
this
form
illustration
which
can
be
called
actual
or
close
lateral
opposition
in
practice
they
are
all
one
and
the
same
the
kings
are
always
on
squares
of
the
same
colour
there
is
only
one
intervening
square
between
the
kings
and
the
player
who
has
moved
last
the
now
if
the
student
will
take
the
trouble
of
moving
each
king
backwards
as
in
a
game
in
the
same
frontal
diagonal
or
lateral
line
respectively
shown
in
the
diagrams
we
shall
have
what
may
be
called
frontal
diagonal
and
lateral
opposition
respectively
the
matter
of
the
opposition
is
highly
important
and
takes
at
times
somewhat
complicated
forms
all
of
which
can
be
solved
mathematically
but
for
the
present
the
student
should
only
consider
the
most
simple
forms
an
examination
of
some
of
the
examples
of
king
and
pawns
endings
already
given
will
show
several
cases
of
close
opposition
in
all
simple
forms
of
opposition
the
kings
are
on
the
same
line
and
the
number
of
intervening
squares
between
them
is
even
the
player
who
has
the
move
has
the
illustration
example
the
above
position
shows
to
advantage
the
enormous
value
of
the
opposition
the
position
is
very
simple
very
little
is
left
on
the
board
and
the
position
to
a
beginner
probably
looks
absolutely
even
it
is
not
the
case
however
has
the
move
notice
that
the
kings
are
directly
in
front
of
one
another
and
that
the
number
of
intervening
squares
is
now
as
to
the
procedure
to
win
such
a
position
the
proper
way
to
begin
is
to
move
straight
up
thus
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
k
b
now
white
can
exercise
the
option
of
either
playing
k
q
and
thus
passing
with
his
king
or
of
playing
k
b
and
prevent
the
black
king
from
passing
thereby
keeping
the
opposition
mere
counting
will
show
that
the
former
course
will
only
lead
to
a
draw
therefore
white
takes
the
latter
course
and
plays
k
b
k
kt
if
k
k
k
kt
will
win
k
k
k
kt
now
by
counting
it
will
be
seen
that
white
wins
by
capturing
black
knight
pawn
the
process
has
been
comparatively
simple
in
the
variation
given
above
but
black
has
other
lines
of
defence
more
difficult
to
overcome
let
us
begin
anew
k
k
k
q
now
if
k
q
k
q
or
if
k
k
k
k
and
black
obtains
the
opposition
in
both
cases
when
the
kings
are
directly
in
front
of
one
another
and
the
number
of
intervening
squares
between
the
kings
is
the
player
who
has
moved
last
has
the
opposition
now
in
order
to
win
the
white
king
must
advance
there
is
only
one
other
square
where
he
can
go
b
and
that
is
the
right
place
therefore
it
is
seen
that
in
such
cases
when
the
opponent
makes
a
waiting
move
you
must
advance
leaving
a
rank
or
file
free
between
the
kings
therefore
we
have
k
b
k
k
now
it
would
be
bad
to
advance
because
then
black
by
bringing
up
his
king
in
front
of
your
king
would
obtain
the
opposition
it
is
white
turn
to
play
a
similar
move
to
black
first
move
viz
k
k
which
brings
the
position
back
to
the
first
variation
shown
the
student
would
do
well
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
handling
of
the
king
in
all
examples
of
opposition
it
often
means
the
winning
or
losing
of
a
game
example
the
following
position
is
an
excellent
proof
of
the
value
of
the
opposition
as
a
means
of
defence
illustration
white
is
a
pawn
behind
and
apparently
lost
yet
he
can
manage
to
draw
as
follows
k
r
the
position
of
the
pawns
does
not
permit
white
to
draw
by
means
of
the
actual
or
close
opposition
hence
he
takes
the
distant
opposition
in
effect
if
k
b

close
opposition

his
safety

in

the
matter

opposition
is
of
paramount
importance
as
in
fact
it
is
in
nearly
all
endings
of
king
and
pawns
except
in
such
cases
where
the
in
itself
ensures
the
win
the
relative
value
of
knight
and
bishop
before
turning
our
attention
to
this
matter
it
is
well
to
state
now
that
knights
alone
can
not
but
under
certain
conditions
of
course
they
can
do
so
if
the
opponent
has
one
or
more
pawns
illustration
example
in
the
above
position
white
can
not
win
although
the
black
king
is
cornered
but
in
the
following
position
in
which
black
has
a
pawn
illustration
white
wins
with
or
without
the
move
thus
kt
kt

r
white
can
not
take
the
pawn
because
the
game
will
be
drawn
as
explained

the
reason
for
this
peculiarity
in
chess
is
evident
with
the
two
knights
can
only
stalemate
the
king
unless
black
has
a
pawn
which
can
be
example
although
he
is
a
bishop
and
a
pawn
ahead
the
following
position
can
not
be
won
by
white
illustration
it
is
the
greatest
weakness
of
the
bishop
that
when
the
rook
pawn
queens
on
a
square
of
opposite
colour
and
the
opposing
king
is
in
front
of
the
pawn
the
bishop
is
absolutely
worthless
all
that
black
has
to
do
is
to
keep
moving
his
king
close
to
the
corner
square
illustration
example
in
the
above
position
white
with
or
without
the
move
can

most

mate
now
that
we
have
seen
these
exceptional
cases
we
can
analyse
the
different
merits
and
the
relative
value
of
the
knight
and
the
bishop
it
is
generally
thought
by
amateurs
that
the
knight
is
the
more
valuable
piece
of
the
two
the
chief
reason
being
that
unlike
the
bishop
the
knight
can
command
both
black
and
white
squares
however
the
fact
is
generally
overlooked
that
the
knight
at
any
one
time
has
the
choice
of
one
colour
only
it
takes
much
longer
to
bring
a
knight
from
one
wing
to
the
other
also
as
shown
in
the
following
example
a
bishop
can
stalemate
a
knight
a
compliment
which
the
knight
is
unable
to
return
example
illustration
the
weaker
the
player
the
more
terrible
the
knight
is
to
him
but
as
a
player
increases
in
strength
the
value
of
the
bishop
becomes
more
evident
to
him
and
of
course
there
is
or
should
be
a
corresponding
decrease
in
his
estimation
of
the
value
of
the
knight
as
compared
to
the
bishop
in
this
respect
as
in
many
others
the
masters
of
are
far
ahead
of
the
masters
of
former
generations
while
not
so
long
ago
some
of
the
very
best
amongst
them
like
pillsbury
and
tchigorin
preferred
knights
to
bishops
there
is
hardly
a
master
of
who
would
not
completely
agree
with
the
statements
made
above
example
this
is
about
the
only
case
when
the
knight
is
more
valuable
than
the
bishop
illustration
it
is
what
is
called
a
and
all
the
pawns
are
on
one
side
of
the
board
if
there
were
pawns
on
both
sides
of
the
board
there
would
be
no
advantage
in
having
a
knight
in
such
a
position
black
has
excellent
chances
of
winning
of
course
there
is
an
extra
source
of
weakness
for
white
in
having
his
pawns
on
the
same
as
his
bishop
this
is
a
mistake
often
made
by
players
the
proper
way
generally
in
an
ending
is
to
have
your
pawns
on
squares
of
opposite
colour
to
that
of
your
own
bishop
when
you
have
your
pawns
on
squares
of
the
same
colour
the
action
of
your
own
bishop
is
limited
by
them
and
consequently
the
value
of
the
bishop
is
diminished
since
the
value
of
a
piece
can
often
be
measured
by
the
number
of
squares
it
commands
while
on
this
subject
i
shall
also
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
is
generally
preferable
to
keep
your
pawns
on
squares
of
the
same
colour
as
that
of
the
opposing
bishop
particularly
if
they
are
passed
pawns
supported
by
the
king
the
principles
might
be
stated
thus
the
opponent
has
a
bishop
keep
your
pawns
on
squares
of
the
same
colour
as
your
opponent
you
have
a
bishop
whether
the
opponent
has
also
one
or
not
keep
your
pawns
on
squares
of
the
opposite
colour
to
that
of
your
own
naturally
these
principles
have
sometimes
to
be
modified
to
suit
the
exigencies
of
the
position
example
in
the
following
position
the
pawns
are
on
one
side
of
the
board
and
there
is
no
advantage
in
having
either
a
knight
or
a
bishop
the
game
should
surely
end
in
a
draw
illustration
example
now
let
us
add
three
pawns
on
each
side
to
the
above
position
so
that
there
are
pawns
on
both
sides
of
the
board
illustration
it
is
now
preferable
to
have
the
bishop
though
the
position
if
properly
played
out
should
end
in
a
draw
the
advantage
of
having
the
bishop
lies
as
much
in
its
ability
to
command
at
long
range
both
sides
of
the
board
from
a
central
position
as
in
its
ability
to
move
quickly
from
one
side
of
the
board
to
the
other
illustration
example
in
the
above
position
it
is
unquestionably
an
advantage
to
have
the
bishop
because
although
each
player
has
the
same
number
of
pawns
they
are
not
balanced
on
each
side
of
the
board
thus
on
the
side
white
has
three
to
two
while
on
the
queen
side
it
is
black
that
has
three
to
two
still
with
proper
play
the
game
should
end
in
a
draw
though
white
has
somewhat
better
chances
illustration
example
here
is
a
position
in
which
to
have
the
bishop
is
a
decided
advantage
since
not
only
are
there
pawns
on
both
sides
of
the
board
but
there
is
a
passed
pawn
k
r
p
for
white
q
r
p
for
black
black
should
have
extreme
difficulty
in
drawing
this
position
if
he
can
do
it
at
all
example
again
black
would
have
great
difficulty
in
drawing
this
position
illustration
the
student
should
carefully
consider
these
positions
i
hope
that
the
many
examples
will
help
him
to
understand
in
their
true
value
the
relative
merits
of
the
knight
and
bishop
as
to
the
general
method
of
procedure
a
teacher
or
practical
experience
will
be
best
i
might
say
generally
however
that
the
proper
course
in
these
endings
as
in
all
similar
endings
is
advance
of
the
king
to
the
centre
of
the
board
or
towards
the
passed
pawns
or
pawns
that
are
susceptible
of
being
attacked
and
rapid
advance
of
the
passed
pawn
or
pawns
as
far
as
is
consistent
with
their
safety
to
give
a
fixed
line
of
play
would
be
folly
each
ending
is
different
and
requires
different
handling
according
to
what
the
adversary
proposes
to
do
calculation
by
visualising
the
future
positions
is
what
will
count
how
to
mate
with
a
knight
and
a
bishop
now
before
going
back
again
to
the
and
the
openings
let
us
see
how
to
mate
with
knight
and
bishop
and
then
how
to
win
with
a
queen
against
a
rook
with
a
knight
and
a
bishop
mate
can
only
be
given
in
the
corners
of
the
same
colour
as
the
illustration

in
this
example
we
must
mate
either
at
q

or
k

the
ending
can
be
divided
into
two
parts
part
one
consists
in
driving
the
black
king
to
the
last
line
we
might
begin
as
is
generally
done
in
all
such
cases
by
advancing
the
king
to
the
centre
of
the
board

other
which

give

the

and
which
i
consider
better
for
the
student
to
learn
because
it
is
more
methodical
and
more
in
accord
with
the
spirit
of
all
these
endings
using
the

much

mate
it
will
be
seen
that
the
ending
is
rather
laborious
there
are
two
outstanding
features
the
close
following
by
the
king
and
the
controlling
of
the
squares
of
opposite
colour
to
the
bishop
by
the
combined
action
of
the
knight
and
king
the
student
would
do
well
to
exercise
himself
methodically
in
this
ending
as
it
gives
a
very
good
idea
of
the
actual
power
of
the
pieces
and
it
requires
foresight
in
order
to
accomplish
the
mate
within
the
fifty
moves
which
are
granted
by
the
rules
queen
against
rook
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
endings
without
pawns
the
resources
of
the
defence
are
many
and
when
used
skilfully
only
a
very
good
player
will
prevail
within
the
limit
of
fifty
moves
allowed
by
the
rules
the
rule
is
that
at
any
moment
you
may
demand
that
your
opponent
mate
you
within
fifty
moves
however
every
time
a
piece
is
exchanged
or
a
pawn
advanced
the
counting
must
begin
afresh
illustration
example
this
is
one
of
the
standard
positions
which
black
can
often
bring
about
now
it
is
white
move
if
it
were
black
move
it
would
be
simple
as
he
would
have
to
move
his
rook
away
from
the
king
find
out
why
and
then
the
rook
would
be
comparatively
easy
to
win
we
deduce
from
the
above
that
the
main
object
is
to
force
the
black
rook
away
from
the
defending
king
and
that
in
order
to
compel
black
to
do
so
we
must
bring
about
the
position
in
the
diagram
with
to
move
once
we
know
what
is
required
the
way
to
proceed
becomes
easier
to
find
thus

in

we

is

now
we
come
to

second
part
the

can
only
go
to
a

square

with

will
win
it

the
procedure
here

things

are
that

interposing

in
the

way
the

we
shall
now
examine
a
more
difficult
position

many
players
would
be

to
all

winning
manoeuvres
also
that

the
student
should
carefully
go
over

we
have
so
far
given
positions
where
the
attacks
were
of
a
violent
nature
and
directed
against
the
king
position
very
often
however
in
the
attacks
are
made
against
a
position
or
against
pieces
or
even
pawns
winning
of
a
pawn
among
good
players
of
even
strength
often
means
the
winning
of
the
hence
the
study
of
such
positions
is
of
great
importance
we
give
below
two
positions
in
which
the
attack
aims
at
the
gain
of
a
mere
pawn
as
a
means
of
ultimately
winning
the
game
illustration
example
black
is
a
pawn
behind
and
there
is
no
violent
direct
attack
against
white
king
black
pieces
however
are
very
well
placed
and
free
to
act
and
by
the
action
of
all
his
pieces
he
is
soon
able
not
only
to
regain
the
pawn
but
to
obtain
the
better
game
the
student
should
carefully
consider
this
position
and
the
subsequent
moves
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
proper
in
the
management
of
forces

black
could
have

he
sees
that
there
is
more
to
be

therefore
increases
the
pressure

side

now
black
will
recover
his

illustration
example
an
examination
of
this
position
will
show
that
black
main
weakness
lies
in
the
exposed
position
of
his
king
and
in
the
fact
that
his
q
r
has
not
yet
come
into
the
game
indeed
if
it
were
black
move
we
might
conclude
that
he
would
have
the
better
game
on
account
of
having
three
pawns
to
two
on
the
queen
side
and
his
bishop
commanding
the
long
diagonal
it
is
however
white
move
and
he
has
two
courses
to
choose
from
the
obvious
move
b
b
might
be
good
enough
since
after
b
b
q
r
q
p
q
kt
would
make
it
difficult
for
black
but
there
is
another
move
which
completely
upsets
black
position
and
wins
a
pawn
besides
obtaining
the
better
position
that
move
is
kt
q
the
game
continues

is
nothing
better

and
white
with
the
better
position
is
a
pawn
ahead
these
positions
have
been
given
with
the
idea
of
acquainting
the
student
with
different
types
of
combinations
i
hope
they
will
also
help
to
develop
his
imagination
a
very
necessary
quality
in
a
good
player
the
student
should
note
in
all
these
positions
that
the
opportunity
is
offered
all
the
pieces
are
thrown
into
action
en
masse
when
necessary
and
that
the
pieces
smoothly
their
action
with
that
at
least
is
what
the
ideal
play
should
be
if
it
is
not
so
altogether
in
these
examples
chapter
iv
general
theory
before
we
revert
to
the
technique
of
the
openings
it
will
be
advisable
to
dwell
a
little
on
general
theory
so
that
the
openings
in
their
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
game
may
be
better
understood
the
initiative
as
the
pieces
are
set
on
the
board
both
sides
have
the
same
position
and
the
same
amount
of
material
white
however
has
the
move
and
the
move
in
this
case
means
and
the
initiative
other
things
being
equal
is
an
advantage
now
this
advantage
must
be
kept
as
long
as
possible
and
should
only
be
given
up
if
some
other
advantage
material
or
positional
is
obtained
in
its
place
white
according
to
the
principles
already
laid
down
develops
his
pieces
as
fast
as
possible
but
in
so
doing
he
also
tries
to
hinder
his
opponent
development
by
applying
pressure
wherever
possible
he
tries
first
of
all
to
control
the
centre
and
failing
this
to
obtain
some
positional
advantage
that
will
make
it
possible
for
him
to
keep
on
harassing
the
enemy
he
only
relinquishes
the
initiative
when
he
gets
for
it
some
material
advantage
under
such
favourable
conditions
as
to
make
him
feel
assured
that
he
will
in
turn
be
able
to
withstand
his
adversary
thrust
and
finally
through
his
superiority
of
material
once
more
resume
the
initiative
which
alone
can
give
him
the
victory
this
last
assertion
is
since
in
order
to
win
the
game
the
opposing
king
must
be
driven
to
a
position
where
he
is
attacked
without
having
any
way
of
escape
once
the
pieces
have
been
properly
developed
the
resulting
positions
may
vary
in
character
it
may
be
that
a
direct
attack
against
the
king
is
in
order
or
that
it
is
a
case
of
improving
a
position
already
advantageous
or
finally
that
some
material
can
be
gained
at
the
cost
of
relinquishing
the
initiative
for
a
more
or
less
prolonged
period
direct
attacks
in
the
first
case
the
attack
must
be
carried
on
with
sufficient
force
to
guarantee
its
success
under
no
consideration
must
a
direct
attack
against
the
king
be
carried
on
unless
there
is
absolute
certainty
in
one
own
mind
that
it
will
succeed
since
failure
in
such
cases
means
disaster
example
a
good
example
of
a
successful
direct
attack
against
the
king
is
shown
in
the
following
diagram
in
this
position
white
could
simply
play
b
b
and
still
have
the
better
position
but
instead
he
prefers
an
immediate
attack
on
the
king
side
with
the
certainty
in
his
mind
that
the
attack
will
lead
to
a
win

the
climax
of
the
combination
started
with

white
is
still
threatening

and
the
best
way
to
avoid
it
is
for
black
to
give
back
all
the
material
he
has
gained
and
to
remain
three
pawns
behind
the
student
should
note
that
in
the
examples
given
the
attack
is
carried
out
with
every
available
piece
and
that
often
as
in
some
of
the
variations
pointed
out
it
is
the
coming
into
action
of
the
last
available
piece
that
finally
overthrows
the
enemy
it
demonstrates
the
principle
already
stated
and
violent
attacks
against
the
king
must
be
carried
with
full
force
to
ensure
their
success
the
opposition
must
be
overcome
at
all
cost
the
attack
can
not
be
broken
off
since
in
all
such
cases
that
means
the
force
of
the
threatened
attack
failing
an
opportunity
in
the
second
case
for
direct
attack
one
must
attempt
to
increase
whatever
weakness
there
may
be
in
the
position
or
if
there
is
none
one
or
more
must
be
created
it
is
always
an
advantage
to
threaten
something
but
such
threats
must
be
carried
into
effect
only
if
something
is
to
be
gained
immediately
for
holding
the
threat
in
hand
forces
the
opponent
to
provide
against
its
execution
and
to
keep
material
in
readiness
to
meet
it
thus
he
may
more
easily
overlook
or
be
unable
to
parry
a
thrust
at
another
point
but
once
the
threat
is
carried
into
effect
it
exists
no
longer
and
your
opponent
can
devote
his
attention
to
his
own
schemes
one
of
the
best
and
most
successful
manoeuvres
in
this
type
of
game
is
to
make
a
demonstration
on
one
side
so
as
to
draw
the
forces
of
your
opponent
to
that
side
then
through
the
greater
mobility
of
your
pieces
to
shift
your
forces
quickly
to
the
other
side
and
break
through
before
your
opponent
has
had
the
time
to
bring
over
the
necessary
forces
for
the
defence
a
good
example
of
positional
play

the

the

that

faulty

has
lost

much
time

brings
his

the
student
can
now
see
how
the
principles
expounded
previously
are
applied
in
this

every
move
is
directed
to
make
the

untenable

to
profit

must
add
that

my

direct
attack
against
the
king
involving
sacrifices
of
pieces
relinquishing
the
initiative
in
the
third
case
there
is
nothing
to
do

the
material
advantage
is
obtained

to

attack

have
passed
over
the

lightly
because
of
its
difficult
nature

because
we
are
at

concerned
more
with
the

the
than
we
are
with
the
endings
which
will
be
treated
separately
cutting
off
pieces
from
the
scene
of
action
very
often
in
a
game
a
master
only
plays
to
cut
off
so
to
speak
one
of
the
pieces
from
the
scene
of
actual
conflict
often
a
bishop
or
a
knight
is
completely
put
out
of
action
in
such
cases
we
might
say
that
from
that
moment
the
game
is
won
because
for
all
practical
purposes
there
will
be
one
more
piece
on

side

on

variation

that

for

in

will
have
to
weaken
his
game
in
some
other
way
whether
this
is
true

not
remains
to
be
proved

in
my
opinion
the
move
is
perfectly
good
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
question
that
black
can
easily
develop
his
pieces
but
it
must
be
considered
that
in
this
variation
white
does
not
attempt
to
hinder
black
development
he
simply
attempts
to
build
up
a
position

he
considers
impregnable

from
which
he
can
start
an
attack

there
are
besides
two
good
reasons

first
that
it

not

much
played

of

consequently
not

hereafter
white
will
act

the
interest
throughout
the

the
game
will
centre
mainly
on
black
play
and
the
manner

which
he
carries
out
the

hereabout
is
weak
it
lacks
force

there
seems
to
be
no
plan
of
attack
it
is
true
that
these
are
the
most
difficult
positions
to
handle
in
a
game
in
such
cases
a
player
must
conceive
a
plan
on
a
large
scale
which
promises
chances
of
success
and
with
it
all
it
must
be
a
plan
that
can
be
carried
out
with

from
the

best
chance
would
be
to
mass
his
forces
for
an
attack

a

fixed
some
of

white
pieces

side
he
should
quickly
shift
his
attack
to
the
queen
side

open
a
line
for
his
rooks

chapter
v
strategy
we
must
now
revert
once
more
to
the
endings
their
importance
will
have
become
evident
to
the
student
who
has
taken
the
trouble
to
study
my
game
with
janowski
example
after
an
uneventful
opening
a
ruy
lopez
in
one
of
its
normal
variations
my
opponent
suddenly
made
things
interesting
by
offering
the
exchange
an
offer
which
of
course
i
accepted
then
followed
a
very
hard
arduous
struggle
in
which
i
had
to
defend
myself
against
a
very
dangerous
attack
made
possible
by
the
excellent
manoeuvring
of
my
adversary
finally
there
came
the
time
when
i
could
give
back
the
material
and
change
off
most
of
the
pieces
and
come
to
an
ending
in
which
i
clearly
had
the
advantage
but
yet
the
ending
itself
was
not
as
simple
as
it
at
first
appeared
and
finally
perhaps
through
one
weak
move
on
my
part
it
became
a
very
difficult
matter
to
find
a
win
had
i
been
a
weak
player
the
game
would
probably
have
ended
in
a
draw
and
all
my
previous
efforts
would
have
been
in
vain
unfortunately
that
is
very
often
the
case
among
the
large
majority
of
players
they
are
weak
in
the
endings
a
failing
from
which
masters
of
the
first
rank
are
at
times
not
free
incidentally
i
might
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
all
the
champions
of
the
last
sixty
years
have
been
exceedingly
strong
in
the
endings
morphy
steinitz
and
lasker
had
no
superiors
in
this
department
of
the
game
while
they
held
their
titles
the
sudden
attack
from
a
different
side
i
have
previously
stated
when
speaking
about
general
theory
that
at
times
the
way
to
win
consists
in
attacking
first
on
one
side
then
granted
greater
mobility
of
the
pieces
to
transfer
the
attack
quickly
from
one
side
to
the
other
breaking
through
before
your
opponent
has
been
able
to
bring
up
sufficient
forces
to
withstand
the
attack
this
principle
of
the
can
sometimes
be
applied
in
the
endings
in
somewhat
similar
manner
example
illustration
in
the
above
position
i
with
the
black
pieces
played
r
k
ch
r
k
r
q
r
r
r
p
k
r
the
idea
as
will
be
seen
very
soon
is
to
play
p
r
in
order
to
fix
white
king
side
pawns
with
a
view
to
the
future
it
is
evident
to
black
that
white
wants
to
bring
his
king
to
q
kt
to
support
his
two
weak
isolated
pawns
and
thus
to
free
his
rooks
black
therefore
makes
a
plan
to
shift
the
attack
to
the
king
side
at
the
proper
time
in
order
to
obtain
some
advantage
from
the
greater
mobility
of
his
rooks
r
q
r
q

in
order
to
force
the
rook

loses
quickly
white
should
have
played

black
would
have
answered

and
black
would
have
obtained
an
opening
at

for
his
king
which
in

might
give
him
the
victory

another
good
example
in
which
is
shown
the
advantage
of
the
greater
mobility
of
the
pieces
in
an
ending
is
the
following
from
a
game
played
at
the
havana
masters
tournament
the
full
score
and
notes
of
the
game
can
be
found
in
the
book
of
the
tournament
illustration
white
only
advantage
in
the
above
position
is
that
he
possesses
the
open
file
and
has
the
move
which
will
secure
him
the
initiative
there
is
also
the
slight
advantage
of
having
his
pawns
on
the
queen
side
united
while
black
has
an
isolated
q
r
the
proper
course
as
in
the
previous
ending
is
to
bring
the
rooks
forward
so
that
at
least
one
of
them
may
be
able
to
shift
from
one
side
of
the
board
to
the
other
and
thus
keep
black
rooks
from
moving
freely
what
this
means
in
general
theory
has
been
stated
already
it
really
means
harassing
the
enemy
force
him
to
use
his
big
pieces
to
defend
pawns
if
he
has
a
weak
point
try
to
make
it
weaker
or
create
another
weakness
somewhere
else
and
his
position
will
collapse
sooner
or
later
if
he
has
a
weakness
and
he
can
get
rid
of
it
make
sure
that
you
create
another
weakness
somewhere
from
the
position
in
question
the
game
continued
thus
r
k
k

with
the
object
of
repeating

manoeuvre

also
not
to
allow

control

to

centre
of

in

to
whatever
point
white
decides
to
attack
the
move
is
justified
at

on
the
general
rule
that
in
such
endings
the
king
should
be
in
the
middle
of

nothing

white

great
difficulties

not
only
is
he
bound
to
lose
a
pawn
but
his
position
is
rather
poor
the
best
he
could
hope
for
was
a
draw
unless
something
altogether
unexpected
happened
as
it
did
no
reason
can
be
given
for
black
loss
of
the
game
except
that
he
felt
so
certain
of
having
the
best
of
it
with
a
pawn
more
and
what
he
considered
a
safe
position
that
he
became
exceedingly
careless
and
did
not
consider
the
danger
that
actually
existed
let
us

how
it

p

this

the

black

and
pawns
endings
of
two
rooks
and
pawns
are
not
very
common
in
actual
play
but
endings
of
one
rook
and
pawns
are
about
the
most
common
sort
of
endings
arising
on
the
chess
board
yet
though
they
do
occur
so
often
few
have
mastered
them
thoroughly
they
are
often
of
a
very
difficult
nature
and
sometimes
while
apparently
very
simple
they
are
in
reality
extremely
intricate
here
is
an
example
from
a
game
between
marshall
and
rosenthal
in
the
manhattan
chess
club
championship
tournament
of
example
illustration
in
this
position
marshall
had
a
simple
win
by
r
b
ch
but
played
p
b
and
thereby
gave
black
a
chance
to
draw
luckily
for
him
black
did
not
see
the
drawing
move
played
poorly
and
lost
had
black
been
up
to
the
situation
he
would
have
drawn
by

if
there
were
nothing
more
in
the

it
would
not
be
of
any
great
value

there
are
other
very
interesting
features

p
r
k
r
r
q

p
k
k
illustration
this
position
we
have
arrived
at
is
won
by
white
because
there
are
two
files
between
the
opposing
king
and
the
pawn
from
which
the
king
is
cut
off
by
the
rook
and
besides
the
pawn
can
advance
to
the
fourth
rank
before
the
opponent
rook
can
begin
to
check
on
the
file
this
last
condition
is
very
important
because
if
instead
of
the
position
on
the
diagram
the
black
rook
were
at
k
r
and
black
had
the
move
he
could
draw
by
preventing
the
advance
of
the
pawn
either
through
constant
checks
or
by
playing
r
k
b
at
the
proper
time
now
that
we
have
explained
the
reasons
why
this
position
is
won
we
leave
it
to
the
student
to
work
out
the
correct
solution
the
fact
that
out
of
one
apparently
simple
ending
we
have
been
able
to
work
out
several
most
unusual
and
difficult
endings
should
be
sufficient
to
impress
upon
the
student
mind
the
necessity
of
becoming
well
acquainted
with
all
kinds
of
endings
and
especially
with
endings
of
rook
and
pawns
a
difficult
ending
two
rooks
and
pawns
following
our
idea
that
the
best
way
to
learn
endings
as
well
as
openings
is
to
study
the
games
of
the
masters
we
give
two
more
endings
of
two
rooks
and
pawns
these
endings
as
already
stated
are
not
very
common
and
the
author
is
fortunate
in
having
himself
played
more
of
these
endings
than
is
generally
the
case
by
carefully
comparing
and
studying
the
endings
already
given
examples
and
with
the
following
the
student
no
doubt
can
obtain
an
idea
of
the
proper
method
to
be
followed
in
such
cases
the
way
of
procedure
is
somewhat
similar
in
all
of
them
example
from
a
game
in
the
new
york
state
championship
tournament
of
illustration
it
is
black
move
and
no
doubt
thinking
that
drawing
such
a
position
that
was
all
black
played
for
would
be
easy
he
contented
himself
with
a
waiting
policy
such
conduct
must
always
be
criticised
it
often
leads
to
disaster
best
way
to
defend
such
positions
is
to
assume
the
initiative
and
keep
the
opponent
on
the
q
r
k
the
first
move
is
already
wrong
there
is
nothing
to
gain
by
this
move
black
should
play
p
q
r
to
be
followed
by
p
q
r
unless
white
plays
p
q
kt
that
would
the
queen
side
after
that
he
could
decide
what
demonstration
he
could
make
with
his
rooks
to
keep
the
opponent
rooks
at
bay
r
q
this
move
not
only
prevents
p
b
which
black
intended
but
threatens
p
kt
followed
after
p
p

by
the
attack
with
one
or
both
rooks
against

however
does
not
want
to
disclose
his
plan
at
once
and
thus
awaken
black
to
the
danger
of
his
position
hence
this
move
which
seems
to
aim
at
the
disruption
of
black
queen
side
pawns
r
k
r
q

k
k
this
is
a
mistake
black
is
unaware
of
the

should
have
played

by
making
this

that

a
beginner
the

may
look
like
a
draw
but
the
advanced
player
will
realise
immediately
that
there
are
great
possibilities
for
black
to
win
not
only
because
he
has
the
initiative
but
because
of
white
undeveloped
queen
side

the
fact
that
a
bishop
in

a
position
is
better
than
a

it
will
take
some
time
for
white
to
bring
his
rook
and
knight
into
the
fray
and
black
can
utilise
it
to
obtain
an
advantage
there
are
two
courses
open
to
him
the
most
evident
and
the
one
that
most
players
would
take
is
to
advance
the
pawn
to
q
b
and
q
b
immediately
in
conjunction
with
the
bishop
check
at
r
and
any
other
move
that
might
be
necessary
with
the
black
rook
the
other
and
more
subtle
course
was
taken
by
black
it
consists
in
utilising
his
rook
in
the
same
way
as
shown
in
the
previous
endings
forcing
white
to
defend
something
all
the
time
restricting
the
action
of
white
knight
and
white
rook
while
at
the
same
time
keeping
freedom
of
action
for
his
own
rook
and
bishop
r
kt
this
forces
p
q

which
blocks
that
square
for
the
white
knight
p
kt

kt
bringing
the
rook
to
attack
the
king
side
pawns
so
as
to
force
the
king
to
that
side
to
defend
them
and
thus
indirectly
making
more
secure
the
position
of
black
queen
side
pawns
p
b

k
r
k
kt

note
that
the
white
knight
sphere
of
action
is
very
limited

that

own
pawns
are
in
his
way

this

nothing
it

drives

ending
chapter
vi
further
openings
and
some
salient
points
about
pawns
before
going
back
to
the
discussion
of
openings
and
positions
it
might
be
well
to
bear
in
mind
a
few
facts
concerning
pawn
positions
which
will
no
doubt
help
to
understand
certain
moves
and
sometimes
even
the
object
of
certain
variations
in
the
openings
and
of
some
manoeuvres
in
the
illustration
example
in
the
position
of
the
diagram
we
have
an
exceedingly
bad
pawn
formation
on
black
side
black
q
b
p
is
altogether
backward
and
white
could
by
means
of
the
open
file
concentrate
his
forces
against
that
weak
point
there
is
also
the
square
at
white
q
b
which
is
controlled
by
white
and
from
where
a
white
piece
once
established
could
not
be
dislodged
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it
black
would
have
to
exchange
it
which
is
not
always
an
easy
matter
and
often
when
possible
not
at
all
convenient
the
same
holds
true
with
regard
to
black
k
p
k
b
p
and
k
kt
p
which
create
what
is
called
a
hole
at
black
k
b
such
pawn
formations
invariably
lead
to
disaster
and
consequently
must
be
avoided
illustration
example
in
this
position
we
might
say
that
the
white
centre
pawns
have
the
attacking
position
while
the
black
centre
pawns
have
the
defensive
position
such
a
formation
of
pawn
occurs
in
the
french
defence
in
such
positions
white
most
often
attempts
by
means
of
p
k
b
and
k
b
to
obtain
a
crushing
attack
against
black
king
which
is
generally
castled
on
the
king
side
to
prevent
that
and
also
to
assume
the
initiative
or
obtain
material
advantage
black
makes
a
by
p
q
b
followed
by
p
p
when
white
defends
the
pawn
by
p
q
b
and
the
concentrating
of
black
pieces
against
the
white
pawn
at
q
this
in
substance
might
be
said
to
be
a
determined
attack
against
white
centre
in
order
to
paralyse
the
direct
attack
of
white
against
black
king
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
it
was
stated
that
of
the
centre
was
an
essential
condition
to
a
successful
attack
against
the
in
an
abstract
way
we
may
say
that
two
or
more
pawns
are
strongest
when
they
are
in
the
same
rank
next
to
one
another
thus
the
centre
pawns
are
strongest
in
themselves
so
to
speak
when
placed
at
k
and
q
respectively
hence
the
question
of
advancing
either
the
one
or
the
other
to
the
fifth
rank
is
one
that
must
be
most
carefully
considered
the
advance
of
either
pawn
often
determines
the
course
the
game
will
follow
another
thing
to
be
considered
is
the
matter
of
one
or
more
passed
pawns
when
they
are
isolated
either
singly
or
in
pairs
we
might
say
that
a
passed
pawn
is
either
very
weak
or
very
strong
and
that
its
weakness
or
strength
whichever
happens
to
be
in
the
case
to
be
considered
increases
as
it
advances
and
is
at
the
same
time
in
direct
relation
to
the
number
of
pieces
on
the
board
in
this
last
respect
it
might
be
generally
said
that
passed
pawn
increases
in
strength
as
the
number
of
pieces
on
the
board
having
all
this
clear
in
mind
we
will
now
revert
to
the
openings
and
we
will
analyse
games
carefully
from
beginning
to
end
according
to
general
principles
i
shall
whenever
possible
use
my
own
games
not
because
they
will
better
illustrate
the
point
but
because
knowing
them
thoroughly
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
them
more
authoritatively
than
the
games
of
others
some
possible
developments
from
a
ruy
lopez
that
some
of
the
variations
in
the
openings
and
the
manoeuvres
in
the
are
often
based
on
some
of
the
elementary
principles
just
expounded
can
be
easily
seen
in
the
following
case

so
far
a
very
variation
of
the
ruy
lopez
in
fact
they
are
the
moves
of
the
game
in
paris
q
q
p
kt
let
us
suppose
the
game
went
on
and
that
in
some
way
white
by
playing
one
of
the
knights
to
q
at
the
proper
time
forced
the
exchange
of
both
knights
and
then
afterwards
both
the
bishops
were
exchanged
and
we
arrived
at
some
such
position
as
shown
in
the
following
diagram
i
obtained
such
a
position
in
a
very
similar
way
once
at
lodz
in
poland
i
was
playing
the
white
pieces
against
a
consulting
team
headed
by
salwe
illustration
now
we
would
have
here
the
case
of
the
backward
q
b
p
which
will
in
no
way
be
able
to
advance
to
q
b
such
a
position
may
be
said
to
be
theoretically
lost
and
in
practice
a
master
will
invariably
win
it
from
black
if
i
may
be
excused
the
reference
i
will
say
that
i
won
the
game
above
referred
to
after
a
few
moves
the
position
may
be
easily
thus
illustration
the
black
pieces
can
be
said
to
be
if
white
plays
q
q
b
black
must
answer
q
q
otherwise
he
will
lose
a
pawn
and
if
white
returns
with
the
queen
to
q
r
black
will
have
again
to
return
to
q
kt
with
the
queen
or
lose
a
pawn
thus
black
can
only
move
according
to
white
lead
and
under
such
conditions
white
can
easily
advance
with
his
pawns
to
k
b
and
k
kt
until
black
will
be
forced
to
stop
p
b
by
playing
p
k
b
and
we
might
finally
have
some
such
position
as
this
example
illustration
in
this
situation
the
game
might
go
on
as
follows
p
p
p
p
q
k
b
q
q
white
threatened
to
win
a
pawn
by
q
p
and
black
could
not
play

k

would
also
win
a

k

q

p

and
white
wins
now
suppose
that
in
the
position
in
the
preceding
diagram
it
were
move
and
he
played
r
k
b
white
would
then
simply
defend
his
k
b
p
by
some
move
like
q
k
b
threatening
r
q
b
p
and
then
he
would
bring
his
king
up
to
kt
and
when
the
time
came
break
through
as
in
the
previous
case
white
might
even
be
able
to
obtain
the
following
position
illustration
black
would
now
be
forced
to
play
r
b
and
white
could
then
play
q
b
and
follow
it
up
with
k
b
and
thus
force
black
to
play
p
p
which
would
give
white
a
greater
advantage
a
careful
examination
of
all
these
positions
will
reveal
that
besides
the
advantage
of
freedom
of
manoeuvre
on
white
part
the
power
of
the
pawn
at
k
is
enormous
and
that
it
is
the
commanding
position
of
this
pawn
and
the
fact
that
it
is
free
to
advance
once
all
the
pieces
are
exchanged
that
constitute
the
pivot
of
all
white
manoeuvres
i
have
purposely
given
positions
without
the
moves
which
lead
to
them
so
that
the
student
may
become
accustomed
to
build
up
in
his
own
mind
possible
positions
that
may
arise
out
of
any
given
situation
thus
he
will
learn
to
make
strategical
plans
and
be
on
his
way
to
the
master
class
the
student
can
derive
enormous
benefit

further

points

the

also
kt

ch
as

never

good

kt
kt

p
k
followed
by

p
q
b
the
fact
that
black
is
practically
forced
to
make
this
move
in
order
to
avoid
the
loss
of
a
pawn
is
sufficient
reason
in
itself
to
condemn
the
whole
system
of
development
on
black
part
in
effect
he
plays
b
q
and
now
he
has
to
shut
off
the
action
of
his
own
bishop
which
thereby
becomes
little
more
than
a
pawn
for
a
while
in
fact
it
is
hard
to
see
how
this
bishop
will
ever
be
able
to
attack
anything
besides
it
can
be
easily
seen
that
white
will
soon
post
his
two
knights
at
k
and
q
b
respectively
and
that
black
will
not
be
able
to
dislodge
them
without
seriously
weakening
his
game
if
he
can
do
it
at
all
from
all
these
reasons
it
can
be
gathered
that
it
would
probably
have
been
better
for
black
to
play
kt
kt
and
thus
get
rid
of
one
of
the
two
white
knights
before
assuming
such
a
defensive
position
in
such
cases
the
less
the
number
of
pieces
on
the
board
the
better
chances
there
are
to
escape
kt
k
p
k
b
this
practically
amounts
to
committing
suicide
since
it
creates
a
hole
at
k
for
white
knight
from
where
it
will
be
practically
impossible
to
dislodge
him
if
black
intended
to
make
such
a
move
he
should
have
done
it
before
when
at

there
would
have
been
an
object
in
preventing
the
white
knight
from
reaching

kt

b
k
kt

the
position
of
white
knights

the
one
at

might
be
said
to
be
ideal
and
a

glance
shows
how
they
dominate
the
position
the
question
henceforth
will
be
how
is
white
going
to
derive
the
full
benefit
from
such
an
advantageous
situation
this
we
shall
soon
see
illustration

is
no
object
in
this
move

it
is
to
be
followed
by

all

that

i
had
played
this
defence
twice
before
in
the
match
with
good
results
and
although
i
lost
this
game
i
still
played
it
until
the
very
last
game
when
i
changed
my
tactics
the
reason
was
my
total
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
different
variations
in
this
opening
coupled
with
the
fact
that
i
knew
that
lasker
had
been
successful
with
it
against
marshall
himself
in
i
thought
that
since
lasker
had
played
it
so
often
it
should
be
good
the
object
is
to
exchange
a
couple
of
pieces
and
at
the
same
time
to
bring
about
a
position
full
of
possibilities
and
with
promising
chances
of
success
once
the
stage
is
reached
on
general
principles
it
should
be
wrong
because
the
same
knight
is
moved
three
times
in
the
opening
although
it
involves
the
exchange
of
two
pieces
in
reality
the
difficulty
in
this
variation
as
well
as
in
nearly
all
the
variations
of
the
queen
gambit
lies
in
the
slow
development
of
black
queen
bishop
however
whether
this
variation
can
or
can
not
be
safely
played
is
a
question
still
to
be
decided
and
it
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
book
i
may
add
that
at
present
my
preference
is
for
a
different
system
of
development
but
it
is
not
unlikely
that
i
should
some
time
come
back
to
this
variation

at

black
is
on

the
idea
of
this
irregular
opening
is
mainly
to
throw
white
on
his
own
resources
at
the
time
the
game
was
played
the
system
of
defence
was
not
as
well
known
as
the
regular
forms
of
the
queen
pawn
openings
whether
it
is
sound
or
not
remains
yet
to
be
proved
its
good
features
are
that
it
keeps
the
centre
intact
without
creating
any
particular
weakness
and
that
it
gives
plenty
of
opportunity
for
deep
and
concealed
manoeuvring
the
drawback
is
the
long
time
it
takes
black
to
develop
his
game
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
white
will
employ
that
time
to
prepare
a
attack
or
that
he
will
use
the
advantage
of
his
development
actually
to
prevent
complete

failing
that

obtain
some
definite

played
for
the
first
time
in
a
similar
position
in
a
game
against
walter
penn
shipley
of
philadelphia
my
idea
is
that
as
there
is
no
black
bishop
and
because
black
pieces
have
been
developed
with
a
view
to
an
attack
on
the
king
side
it
will
be
impossible
for
black
to
take
advantage
of
the
apparently
unprotected
position
of
white
king
two
possibilities
must
be
considered
firstly
if
black
castles
on
the
queen
side
as
in
this
game
it
is
evident
that
there
is
no
danger
of
an
attack
secondly
if
black

the

the

obtained

another

it
is
now
time
to
examine
the
result
of
the
opening
on
white
side
we
find
the
minor
pieces
well
posted
and
the
queen
out
in
a
somewhat
odd
place
it
is
true
but
safe
from
attack
and
actually
attacking
a
pawn
white
is
also
ready
to
castle
white
position
is
evidently
free
from
danger
and
his
pieces
can
easily
manoeuvre
on
black
side
the
first
thing
we
notice
is
that
he
has
retained
both
his
bishops
unquestionably
an
advantage
but
on
the
other
hand
we
find
his
pieces
bunched
together
too
much
and
the
queen
in
danger
of
being
attacked
without
having
any
good
square
to
go
to
the
bishop
at
k
has
no
freedom
and
it
blocks
the
queen
which
in
its
turn
blocks
the
bishop
besides
black
can
not
castle
on
the
king
side
because
q
p
r
kt
q
k
threatening
mate
wins
a
pawn
nor
can
he
castle
on
the
queen
side
because
q
r
would
put
black
game
in
imminent
danger
since
he
can
not
play
p
r
because
of
b
p
nor
can
he
play
k
kt
because
of
kt
kt
consequently
we
must
conclude
that
the
opening
is
all
in
favour
p

to
make
room
for
his
queen
threatening
also

p

up
a
pawn

him
to
find
a

bring
his

thus
lay
the
foundation
for

attack
against
white
king
the
plan
however
fails
as
it
always
must
in
such
cases
because
development
is
backward
and
consequently
his
pieces
are
not
properly
placed

a

move
which
destroys

utterly
black

the
