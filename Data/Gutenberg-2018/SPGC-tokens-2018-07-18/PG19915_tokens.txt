this
edition
of
slovenly

was
originally
published
in
slovenly
betsy
betsy
would
never
wash
herself
when
from
her
bed
she
rose
but
just
as
quickly
as
she
could
she
hurried
on
her
clothes
to
keep
her
clothes
all
nice
and
clean
miss
betsy
took
no
pains
in
holes
her
stockings
always
were
her
dresses
filled
with
stains
sometimes
she
went
day
after
day
and
never
combed
her
hair
while
little
feathers
from
her
bed
stuck
on
it
here
and
there
the
schoolboys
when
they
betsy
saw
would
point
her
out
and
cry
oh
betsy
what
a
sight
you
are
oh
slovenly
betsy
fie
one
rainy
day
her
parents
went
some
pleasant
friends
to
meet
they
took
betsy
along
with
them
all
dressed
so
clean
and
neat
nice
little
boys
and
girls
were
there
with
whom
our
betsy
played
until
of
playing
she
grew
tired
and
to
the
garden
strayed
out
in
the
rain
she
danced
awhile
but
was
not
long
before
flat
down
she
tumbled
in
the
mud
and
her
best
clothes
she
tore
illustration
oh
what
a
sight
she
was
indeed
when
in
the
room
she
came
the
guests
all
loudly
laughed
at
her
and
she
almost
died
with
shame
she
turned
and
to
her
home
she
ran
and
then
as
here
you
see
she
washed
her
clothes
and
since
has
been
as
neat
as
she
could
be

phoebe
ann
the
proud
girl
this
phoebe
ann
was
a
very
proud
girl
her
nose
had
always
an
upward
curl
illustration
she
thought
herself
better
than
all
others
beside
and
beat
even
the
peacock
himself
in
pride
illustration
she
thought
the
earth
was
so
dirty
and
brown
that
never
by
chance
would
she
look
down
and
she
held
up
her
head
in
the
air
so
high
that
her
neck
began
stretching
by
and
by
it
stretched
and
it
stretched
and
it
grew
so
long
that
her
parents
thought
something
must
be
wrong
it
stretched
and
stretched
and
they
soon
began
to
look
up
with
fear
at
their
phoebe
ann
illustration
they
prayed
her
to
stop
her
upward
gaze
but
phoebe
kept
on
in
her
old
proud
ways
until
her
neck
had
grown
so
long
and
spare
that
her
head
was
more
than
her
neck
could
bear
and
it
bent
to
the
ground
like
a
willow
tree
and
brought
down
the
head
of
this
proud
phoebe
until
whenever
she
went
out
a
walk
to
take
the
boys
would
shout
here
comes
a
snake
illustration
her
head
got
to
be
so
heavy
to
drag
on
that
she
had
to
put
it
on
a
little
wagon
so
do
my
friends
hold
your
head
too
high
or
your
neck
may
stretch
too

and
by

the
dreadful
story
of
pauline
and
the
matches
mamma
and
nurse
went
out
one
day
and
left
pauline
alone
at
play
around
the
room
she
gayly
sprang
clapp
her
hands
and
danced
and
sang
now
on
the
table
close
at
hand
a
box
of
matches
chanced
to
stand
and
kind
mamma
and
nurse
had
told
her
that
if
she
touched
them
they
would
scold
her
but
pauline
said
oh
what
a
pity
for
when
they
burn
it
is
so
pretty
they
crackle
so
and
spit
and
flame
and
mamma
often
burns
the
same
i
only
light
a
match
or
two
as
i
have
often
seen
my
mother
do
illustration
when
minz
and
maunz
the
cats
heard
this
they
said
oh
naughty
naughty
miss
they
cried
you
burn
to
death
if
you
do
so
mamma
forbids
it
do
you
know
but
pauline
would
not
take
advice
she
lit
a
match
it
was
so
nice
it
crackled
so
it
burned
so
clear
exactly
like
the
picture
here
she
jumped
for
joy
and
ran
about
and
was
too
pleased
to
put
it
out
illustration
when
minz
and
maunz
the
cats
saw
this
they
said
oh
naughty
naughty
miss
and
rais
their
paws
and
stretch
their
claws
is
very
very
wrong
you
know
you
will
be
burnt
if
you
do
so
mamma
forbids
it
do
you
know
now
see
oh
see
a
dreadful
thing
the
fire
has
caught
her
apron
string
her
apron
burns
her
arms
her
hair
she
burns
all
over
everywhere
illustration
then
how
the
pussy
cats
did
mew
what
else
poor
pussies
could
they
do
they
screamed
for
help
was
all
in
vain
so
then
they
said
we
scream
again
make
haste
make
haste
she
burn
to
death
we
told
her
so
pauline
was
burnt
with
all
her
clothes
and
arms
and
hands
and
eyes
and
nose
till
she
had
nothing
more
to
lose
except
her
little
scarlet
shoes
and
nothing
else
but
these
was
found
among
her
ashes
on
the
ground
and
when
the
good
cats
sat
beside
the
smoking
ashes
how
they
cried
what
will
mamma
and
nursey
do
their
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
so
fast
they
made
a
little
pond
at
last
illustration
what
happened
to
lazy
charlotte
here
charlotte
said
mamma
one
day
these
stockings
knit
while
i
away
and
should
you
fail
be
sure
you
find
mamma
is
strict
although
she
kind
illustration
but
charlotte
took
a
lazy
fit
and
did
not
feel
inclined
to
knit
and
soon
upon
the
ground
let
fall
needles
and
worsted
hose
and
all
i
shall
not
knit
said
she
not
i
at
least
not
now
but
by
and
by
then
stretched
and
yawned
and
rubbed
her
eyes
like
sluggards
when
is
time
to
rise
illustration
but
when
mamma
came
home
and
found
the
work
all
strewed
upon
the
ground
quoth
she
you
will
not
knit
and
so
to
school
barefooted
you
shall
go
this
put
poor
charlotte
in
a
fright
and
though
she
knew
it
served
her
right
she
wept
and
begged
and
prayed
but
still
she
could
not
change
her
mother
will
illustration
to
school
where
all
were
spruce
and
neat
poor
charlotte
went
with
naked
feet
some
showed
their
pity
some
their
pride
while
charlotte
hid
her
face
and
cried
illustration
the
oh
why
are
you
always
so
bitterly
crying
you
surely
will
make
yourself
blind
what
reason
on
earth
for
such
sobbing
and
sighing
i
pray
can
you
possibly
find
there
is
no
real
sorrow
there
nothing
distressing
to
make
you
thus
grieve
and
lament
ah
no
you
are
just
at
this
moment
possessing
whatever
should
make
you
content
illustration
now
do
my
dear
daughter
give
over
this
weeping
such
was
a
kind
mother
advice
but
all
was
in
vain
for
you
see
she
still
keeping
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
illustration
but
now
she
removes
it
and
oh
she
discloses
a
countenance
full
of
dismay
for
she
certainly
feels
or
at
least
she
supposes
her
eyesight
is
going
away
she
is
not
mistaken
her
sight
is
departing
she
knows
it
and
sorrows
the
more
then
rubs
her
sore
eyes
to
relieve
them
from
smarting
and
makes
them
still
worse
than
before
illustration
and
now
the
poor
creature
is
cautiously
crawling
and
feeling
her
way
all
around
and
now
from
their
sockets
her
eyeballs
are
falling
see
there
they
are
down
on
the
ground
my
children
from
such
an
example
take
warning
and
happily
live
while
you
may
and
say
to
yourselves
when
you
rise
in
the
morning
i
try
to
be
cheerful
today
illustration
the
story
of
romping
polly
i
pray
you
now
my
little
child
thus
once
a
kind
old
lady
spoke
to
her
niece
in
accents
mild
do
try
to
be
more
steady
i
know
that
you
will
often
see
rude
boys
push
drive
and
hurry
but
little
girls
should
never
be
all
in
a
heat
and
flurry
illustration
while
thus
the
lady
gave
advice
and
lectured
little
polly
to
see
her
stand
with
downcast
eyes
you
think
she
owned
her
folly
she
did
and
many
a
promise
made
but
when
her
aunt
departed
forgetting
all
the
silly
maid
off
to
the
playground
started
illustration
now
see
what
frolic
and
what
fun
the
little
folks
are
after
away
they
jump
away
they
run
with
many
a
shout
and
laughter
illustration
but
fools
who
never
will
be
taught
except
by
some
disaster
soon
find
their
knowledge
dearly
bought
and
of
a
cruel
master
this
little
girl
who
spite
of
all
her
good
old
aunt
had
spoken
would
romp
about
had
such
a
fall
that
her
poor
leg
was
broken
illustration
in
sore
amaze
those
standing
by
then
placed
her
on
a
barrow
but
oh
to
hear
her
scream
and
cry
their
souls
it
sure
did
harrow
illustration
see
how
her
brother
bursts
in
tears
when
told
the
dreadful
story
and
see
how
carefully
he
bears
the
limb
all
wet
and
gory
illustration
full
many
a
week
screwed
up
in
bed
she
lingered
sad
and
weary
illustration
and
went
on
crutches
it
is
said
until
she
died
so
dreary
illustration
the
story
of
a
dirty
child
the
little
girls
whom
now
you
see
were
sisters
in
one
family
and
both
enjoyed
an
equal
share
of
a
kind
mother
anxious
care
this
one
in
neatness
took
a
pride
and
oft
the
brush
and
comb
applied
illustration
oft
washed
her
face
and
oft
her
hands
see
now
thus
occupied
she
stands
illustration
the
other
oh
i
grieve
to
say
how
she
would
scream
and
run
away
soon
as
she
saw
her
mother
stand
with
water
by
and
sponge
in
hand
she
kick
and
stamp
and
jump
about
and
set
up
such
an
awful
shout
that
one
who
did
not
know
the
child
would
say
she
must
be
going
wild
illustration
in
consequence
it
came
to
pass
while
one
was
quite
a
pretty
lass
and
many
a
fond
admirer
gained
and
many
a
little
gift
obtained
illustration
the
other
viewed
with
general
scorn
was
left
forsaken
and
forlorn
for
no
one
can
endure
to
see
a
child
all
dirt
and
misery
behold
how
needful
is
that
we
should
clean
in
dress
and
person
be
or
else
believe
me
is
in
vain
we
hope
affection
to
obtain
illustration
a
sloven
will
be
always
viewed
with
pity
by
the
wise
and
good
while
the
vicious
and
the
base
behold
with
scorn
a
dirty
face
illustration
envious
minnie
now
minnie
was
a
pretty
girl
her
hair
so
gracefully
did
curl
she
had
a
slender
figure
too
and
rosy
cheeks
and
eyes
of
blue
and
yet
with
all
those
beauties
rare
those
angel
eyes
and
curly
hair
oh
many
many
faults
had
she
the
worst
of
which
was
jealousy
when
on
the
brilliant
christmas
tree
nicholas
hung
his
gifts
so
free
the
envious
minnie
could
not
bear
with
any
one
those
gifts
to
share
and
when
her
sisters
birthdays
came
minnie
it
must
be
told
with
shame
would
envy
every
pretty
thing
which
dear
mamma
to
them
would
bring
illustration
sometimes
great
tears
rolled
from
her
eyes
sometimes
she
pierced
the
air
with
cries
for
hours
together
she
would
fret
because
their
toys
she
could
not
get
ah
then
how
changed
this
pretty
child
no
longer
amiable
and
mild
that
fairy
form
and
smiling
face
lost
all
their
sprightliness
and
grace
her
tender
mother
often
sighed
and
to
reform
her
daughter
tried
oh
minnie
minnie
she
would
say
quite
yellow
you
will
turn
some
day
illustration
now
came
the
merry
christmas
feast
nicholas
brought
to
the
least
such
pretty
presents
rich
and
rare
but
all
the
best
for
minnie
were
now
to
her
little
sister
bess
nicholas
brought
a
yellow
dress
this
minnie
longed
for
envious
child
and
snatched
it
from
her
sister
mild
then
all
in
tears
did
bessie
run
to
tell
her
mother
what
was
done
illustration
then
minnie
ran
triumphantly
to
try
the
dress
on
as
you
see
but
minnie
was
not
satisfied
she
pouted
fretted
sulked
and
cried
sisters
and
brothers
had
no
rest
she
vowed
their
presents
were
the
best
and
springing
quickly
to
the
glass
what
saw
she
there
alas
alas
oh
what
a
sad
such
deep
disgrace
she
found
she
had
a
yellow
face
ah
me
she
cried
now
in
despair
where
are
my
rosy
cheeks
oh
where
exclaimed
her
mother
now
you
see
the
punishment
of
jealousy
illustration
the
little
glutton
oh
how
this
mary
loved
to
eat
it
was
her
chief
delight
she
would
have
something
sour
or
sweet
to
munch
from
morn
till
night
she
to
the
pantry
daily
stole
and
slyly
she
would
take
sugar
and
plums
and
sweetmeats
too
and
apples
nuts
and
cake
illustration
her
mother
mary
oft
reproved
but
ah
it
did
no
good
munch
nibble
chew
from
morn
to
night
the
little
glutton
would
illustration
one
day
upon
some
near
she
chanced
to
cast
her
eyes
how
nice
that
honey
there
must
taste
she
cried
and
off
she
flies
on
tiptoe
now
the
hives
she
nears
close
up
to
them
she
creeps
and
through
the
little
window
panes
quite
cautiously
she
peeps
oh
dear
how
good
it
looks
she
cries
as
she
the
honey
sees
i
must
i
will
indeed
have
some
it
can
not
hurt
the
bees
and
then
a
hive
she
gently
lifts
oh
foolish
foolish
child
down
down
it
falls
out
swarm
the
bees
buzzing
with
fury
wild
with
fright
she
shrieks
and
tries
to
run
but
ah
is
all
in
vain
upon
her
light
the
angry
bees
and
make
her
writhe
with
pain
illustration
four
weeks
and
more
did
mary
lie
upon
her
little
bed
and
ah
instead
of
honey
she
on
medicine
was
fed
her
parents
grieved
so
much
at
first
their
child
so
sick
to
see
but
once
more
well
with
joy
they
found
her
cured
of
gluttony
illustration
sophie
spoilall
i
never
saw
a
girl
or
boy
so
prone
as
sophie
to
destroy
she
laid
her
hands
upon
though
tough
as
wood
or
hard
as
stone
with
sophie
it
was
all
the
same
no
matter
who
the
thing
might
claim
no
matter
were
it
choice
or
rare
for
naught
did
the
destroyer
care
her
playthings
shared
the
common
lot
though
hers
they
were
she
spared
them
not
her
dolls
she
oft
tore
limb
from
limb
to
gratify
a
foolish
whim
illustration
fie
said
her
mother
do
you
know
that
if
you
use
your
playthings
so
kriss
kringle
will
in
wrath
refuse
to
give
you
what
you
might
abuse
remember
how
in
times
gone
by
you
always
found
a
rich
supply
of
christmas
presents
but
beware
you
find
no
more
another
year
illustration
you
think
such
words
would
surely
tend
to
make
this
child
her
ways
amend
but
no
she
still
her
course
pursued
regardless
of
advice
so
good
but
when
her
mother
sees
is
plain
that
all
her
arguments
are
vain
says
she
since
i
have
done
my
best
i
let
experience
do
the
rest
meantime
the
season
of
the
year
for
christmas
gifts
was
drawing
near
and
sophie
doubted
not
that
she
an
ample
store
of
them
would
see
at
length
the
happy
hour
was
come
the
children
led
into
the
room
behold
with
wonder
and
surprise
three
tables
set
before
their
eyes
one
is
for
nelly
one
for
ned
and
both
with
choicest
treasures
spread
