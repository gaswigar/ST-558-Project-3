translation

introduction
by
william
archer
introduction
the
anecdotic
history
of
gabriel
is
even
scantier
than
that
of
it
is
true
that
two
mentions
of
it
occur
in
ibsen
letters
but
they
throw
no
light
whatever
upon
its
spiritual
antecedents
writing
to
george
brandes
from
christiania
on
april
ibsen
says
in
your
last
letter
you
make
the
suggestion
that
i
should
visit
london
if
i
knew
enough
english
i
might
perhaps
go
but
as
i
unfortunately
do
not
i
must
give
up
the
idea
altogether
besides
i
am
engaged
in
preparing
for
a
big
new
work
and
i
do
not
wish
to
put
off
the
writing
of
it
longer
than
necessary
it
might
so
easily
happen
that
a
fell
on
my
head
before
i
had
time
to
make
the
last
verse
and
what
then
on
october
of
the
same
year
writing
to
the
same
correspondent
he
again
alludes
to
his
work
as
a
new
long
play
which
must
be
completed
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
completed
with
very
little
delay
for
it
appeared
in
copenhagen
on
december
the
irresponsible
gossip
of
the
time
made
out
that
bjornson
discerned
in
the
play
some
personal
allusions
to
himself
but
this
bjornson
emphatically
denied
i
am
not
aware
that
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
identify
the
original
of
the
various
characters
it
need
scarcely
be
pointed
out
that
in
the
sisters
gunhild
and
ella
we
have
the
pair
of
women
one
strong
and
masterful
the
other
tender
and
devoted
who
run
through
so
many
of
ibsen
plays
from
feast
at
onwards
nay
even
from
in
my
introduction
to
lady
from
the
xxii
it
is
pointed
out
that
ibsen
had
the
character
of
foldal
clearly
in
his
mind
when
in
march
he
made
the
first
draft
of
that
play
the
character
there
appears
as
the
old
married
clerk
has
written
a
play
in
his
youth
which
was
only
once
acted
is
for
ever
touching
it
up
and
lives
in
the
illusion
that
it
will
be
published
and
will
make
a
great
success
takes
no
steps
however
to
bring
this
about
nevertheless
accounts
himself
one
of
the
class
his
wife
and
children
believe
blindly
in
the
play
by
the
time
foldal
actually
came
to
life
the
faith
of
his
wife
and
children
had
sadly
dwindled
away
there
was
scarcely
a
theatre
in
scandinavia
or
finland
at
which
gabriel
was
not
acted
in
the
course
of
january
helsingors
led
the
way
with
performances
both
at
the
swedish
and
the
finnish
theatres
on
january
christiania
and
stockholm
followed
on
january
copenhagen
on
january
and
meanwhile
the
piece
had
been
presented
at
many
provincial
theatres
as
well
in
christiania
borkman
gunhild
and
ella
were
played
by
garmann
fru
gundersen
and
froken
reimers
respectively
in
copenhagen
by
emil
pousen
fru
eckhardt
and
fru
hennings
in
the
course
of
it
spread
all
over
germany
beginning
with
frankfort
on
main
where
oddly
enough
it
was
somewhat
maltreated
by
the
censorship
in
london
an
organization
calling
itself
the
new
century
theatre
presented
gabriel
at
the
strand
theatre
on
the
afternoon
of
may
with
vernon
as
borkman
miss
genevieve
ward
as
gunhild
miss
elizabeth
robins
as
ella
rentheim
martin
harvey
as
erhart
james
welch
as
foldal
and
beerbohm
tree
as
wilton
the
first
performance
in
america
was
given
by
the
criterion
independent
theatre
of
new
york
on
november
henley
playing
borkman
john
blair
erhart
miss
maude
banks
gunhild
and
miss
ann
warrington
ella
for
some
reason
which
i
can
only
conjecture
to
be
the
weakness
of
the
the
third
act
the
play
seems
nowhere
to
have
taken
a
very
firm
hold
on
the
stage
brahm
has
drawn
attention
to
the
great
similarity
between
the
theme
of
gabriel
and
that
of
of
in
both
he
says
we
have
a
business
man
of
great
ability
who
is
guilty
of
a
crime
in
both
this
man
is
placed
between
two
sisters
and
in
both
he
renounces
a
marriage
of
inclination
for
the
sake
of
a
marriage
that
shall
further
his
business
interests
the
likeness
is
undeniable
and
yet
how
utterly
unlike
are
the
two
plays
and
how
immeasurably
superior
the
later
one
it
may
seem
on
a
superficial
view
that
in
gabriel
ibsen
has
returned
to
prose
and
the
common
earth
after
his
excursion
into
poetry
and
the
possibly
supernatural
if
i
may
so
call
it
in
master
and
but
this
is
a
very
superficial
view
indeed
we
have
only
to
compare
the
whole
invention
of
gabriel
with
the
invention
of
of
to
realise
the
difference
between
the
poetry
and
the
prose
of
drama
the
quality
of
imagination
which
conceived
the
story
of
the
house
of
bernick
is
utterly
unlike
that
which
conceived
the
tragedy
of
the
house
of
borkman
the
difference
is
not
greater
between
say
merchant
of
and
the
technical
feat
which
ibsen
here
achieves
of
carrying
through
without
a
single
break
the
whole
action
of
a
play
has
been
much
commented
on
and
admired
the
imaginary
time
of
the
drama
is
actually
shorter
than
the
real
time
of
representation
since
the
poet
does
not
even
leave
intervals
for
the
changing
of
the
scenes
this
feat
however
is
more
curious
than
important
nothing
particular
is
gained
by
such
a
literal
observance
of
the
unity
of
time
for
the
rest
we
feel
definitely
in
gabriel
what
we
already
felt
vaguely
in
that
the
poet
technical
is
beginning
to
fail
him
we
feel
that
the
initial
design
was
larger
and
more
detailed
than
the
finished
work
if
the
last
acts
of
wild
and
be
compared
with
the
last
acts
of
and
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
earlier
plays
it
relaxes
towards
the
close
to
make
room
for
pure
imagination
and
lyric
beauty
the
actual
drama
is
over
long
before
the
curtain
falls
on
either
play
and
in
the
one
case
we
have
rita
and
allmers
in
the
other
ella
and
borkman
looking
back
over
their
shattered
lives
and
playing
chorus
to
their
own
tragedy
for
my
part
i
set
the
highest
value
on
these
choral
odes
these
mournful
antiphones
in
which
the
poet
definitely
triumphs
over
the
mere
playwright
they
seem
to
me
noble
and
beautiful
in
themselves
and
as
truly
artistic
if
not
as
theatrical
as
any
abrupter
catastrophe
could
be
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
they
are
exactly
the
conclusions
the
poet
originally
projected
and
still
less
am
i
satisfied
that
they
are
reached
by
precisely
the
paths
which
he
at
first
designed
to
pursue
the
traces
of
a
change
of
scheme
in
gabriel
seem
to
me
almost
unmistakable
the
first
two
acts
laid
the
foundation
for
a
larger
and
more
complex
superstructure
than
is
ultimately
erected
ibsen
seems
to
have
designed
that
hinkel
the
man
who
betrayed
borkman
in
the
past
should
play
some
efficient
part
in
the
alienation
of
erhart
from
his
family
and
home
otherwise
why
this
insistence
on
a
party
at
the
hinkels
which
is
apparently
to
serve
as
a
sort
of
for
erhart
and
wilton
it
appears
in
the
third
act
that
the
party
was
imaginary
erhart
and
i
were
the
whole
party
says
wilton
and
little
frida
of
course
we
might
then
suppose
it
to
have
been
a
mere
blind
to
enable
erhart
to
escape
from
home
but
in
the
first
place
as
erhart
does
not
live
at
home
there
is
no
need
for
any
such
pretext
in
the
second
place
it
appears
that
the
trio
do
actually
go
to
the
hinkels
house
since
borkman
servant
finds
them
there
and
do
actually
make
it
their
erhart
comes
and
goes
with
the
utmost
freedom
in
wilton
own
house
what
possible
reason
can
they
have
for
not
setting
out
from
there
no
reason
is
shown
or
hinted
we
can
not
even
imagine
that
the
hinkels
have
been
instrumental
in
bringing
erhart
and
wilton
together
it
is
expressly
stated
that
erhart
made
her
acquaintance
and
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
in
town
before
she
moved
out
to
the
country
the
whole
conception
of
the
party
at
the
hinkels
is
as
it
stands
mysterious
and
a
little
cumbersome
we
are
forced
to
conclude
i
think
that
something
more
was
at
one
time
intended
to
come
of
it
and
that
when
the
poet
abandoned
the
idea
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
remove
the
scaffolding
to
this
change
of
plan
too
we
may
possibly
trace
what
i
take
to
be
the
one
serious
flaw
in
the
the
play
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
second
half
of
the
third
act
the
scene
of
erhart
rebellion
against
the
claims
of
the
mother
aunt
and
father
strikes
one
as
the
symmetrical
working
out
of
a
problem
rather
than
a
passage
of
living
drama
all
this
means
of
course
that
there
is
a
certain
looseness
of
fibre
in
gabriel
which
we
do
not
find
in
the
best
of
earlier
works
but
in
point
of
intellectual
power
and
poetic
beauty
it
yields
to
none
of
its
predecessors
the
conception
of
the
three
leading
figures
is
one
of
the
great
things
of
literature
the
second
act
with
the
exquisite
humour
of
the
foldal
scene
and
the
dramatic
intensity
of
the
encounter
between
borkman
and
ella
is
perhaps
the
finest
single
act
ibsen
ever
wrote
in
prose
at
all
events
and
the
last
scene
is
a
thing
of
rare
and
exalted
beauty
one
could
wish
that
the
poet
last
words
to
us
had
been
those
haunting
lines
with
which
gunhild
and
ella
join
hands
over
borkman
body
we
twin
sisters
over
him
we
both
have
loved
we
two
shadows
over
the
dead
man
among
many
verbal
difficulties
which
this
play
presents
the
greatest
perhaps
has
been
to
find
an
equivalent
for
the
word
opreisning
which
occurs
again
and
again
in
the
first
and
second
acts
no
one
english
word
that
i
could
discover
would
fit
in
all
the
different
contexts
so
i
have
had
to
employ
three
redemption
restoration
and
in
one
place
rehabilitation
the
reader
may
bear
in
mind
that
these
three
terms
represent
one
idea
in
the
original
borkman
in
act
ii
uses
a
very
odd
expression
overskurkens
moral
which
i
have
rendered
the
morals
of
the
higher
rascality
i
can
not
but
suspect
though
for
this
i
have
no
authority
that
in
the
word
overskurk
which
might
be
represented
in
german
by
ueberschurke
borkman
is
parodying
the
expression
uebermensch
of
which
so
much
has
been
heard
of
late
when
i
once
suggested
this
to
ibsen
he
neither
affirmed
nor
denied
it
i
understood
him
to
say
however
that
in
speaking
of
overskurken
he
had
a
particular
man
in
view
somewhat
pusillanimously
perhaps
i
pursued
my
inquiries

wilton
i
suppose
the

approaching
no

a
strange
lady
borkman
taking
the

let
me
see
reads
it
rises
hastily
and
looks
intently
at
the

are
you
sure
this
is
for

the

yes
i
understand
it
was
for
you
borkman
did
she
say
she
wanted
to
see
borkman
the
maid
yes
she
did
borkman
shortly
resolutely
good
then
say
i
am
at

the

opens
the
door
for
the
strange
lady
and
goes
out
miss
ella
rentheim
enters
she
resembles
her
sister
but
her
face
has
rather
a
suffering
than
a
hard
expression
it
still
shows
signs
of
great
beauty
combined
with
strong
character
she
has
a
great
deal
of
hair
which
is
drawn
back
from
the
forehead
in
natural
ripples
and
is
she
is
dressed
in
black
velvet
with
a
hat
and
a

of
the

material
the
two
sisters
stand
silent
for
a
time
and
look
searchingly
at
each
other
each
is
evidently
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
first
ella
rentheim
who
has
remained
near
the
door
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
gunhild
borkman
standing
erect
and
immovable
between
the
sofa
and
the
table
resting
her
upon
the
cloth
have
you
not
made
a
mistake
the
bailiff
lives
in
the
side
wing
you
know
ella
rentheim
it
is
not
the
bailiff
i
want
to
see
borkman
is
it
me
you
want
then
ella
rentheim
yes
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
you
borkman
coming
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
room
well
then
sit
down
ella
rentheim
thank
you
i
can
quite
well
stand
for
the
present
borkman
just
as
you
please
but
at
least
loosen
your
cloak
ella
rentheim
unbuttoning
her
cloak
yes
it
is
very
warm
here
borkman
i
am
always
cold
ella
rentheim
stands
looking
at
her
for
a
time
with
her
arms
resting
on
the
back
of
the
armchair
well
gunhild
it
is
nearly
eight
years
now
since
we
saw
each
other
last
borkman
coldly
since
last
we
spoke
to
each
other
at
any
rate
ella
rentheim
true
since
we
spoke
to
each
other
i
daresay
you
have
seen
me
now
and
again
when
i
came
on
my
yearly
visit
to
the
bailiff
borkman
once
or
twice
i
have
ella
rentheim
i
have
caught
one
or
two
glimpses
of
you
too
there
at
the
window
borkman
you
must
have
seen
me
through
the
curtains
then
you
have
good
eyes
harshly
and
cuttingly
but
the
last
time
we
spoke
to
each
other
it
was
here
in
this
room
ella
rentheim
trying
to
stop
her
yes
yes
i
know
gunhild
borkman
the
week
before
he
before
he
was
let
out
ella
rentheim
moving
towards
the
back
o
do
speak
about
that
borkman
firmly
but
in
a
low
voice
it
was
the
week
before
he
was
set
at
liberty
ella
rentheim
coming
down
oh
yes
yes
yes
i
shall
never
forget
that
time
but
it
is
too
terrible
to
think
of
only
to
recall
it
for
the
moment
oh
borkman
gloomily
and
yet
one
thoughts
can
never
get
away
from
it
vehemently
clenching
her
hands
together
no
i
ca
understand
how
such
a
thing
how
anything
so
horrible
can
come
upon
one
single
family
and
then
that
it
should
be
our
family
so
old
a
family
as
ours
think
of
its
choosing
us
out
ella
rentheim
oh
gunhild
there
were
many
many
families
besides
ours
that
that
blow
fell
upon
borkman
oh
yes
but
those
others
do
trouble
me
very
much
for
in
their
case
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
little
money
or
some
papers
but
for
us
for
me
and
then
for
erhart
my
little
boy
as
he
then
was
in
rising
excitement
the
shame
that
fell
upon
us
two
innocent
ones
the
dishonour
the
hateful
terrible
dishonour
and
then
the
utter
ruin
too
ella
rentheim
cautiously
tell
me
gunhild
how
does
he
bear
it
borkman
erhart
do
you
mean
ella
rentheim
no
he
himself
how
does
he
bear
it
borkman
scornfully
do
you
think
i
ever
ask
about
that
ella
rentheim
ask
surely
you
do
not
require
to
ask
borkman
looks
at
her
in
surprise
you
do
suppose
i
ever
have
anything
to
do
with
him
that
i
ever
meet
him
that
i
see
anything
of
him
ella
rentheim
not
even
that
borkman
as
before
the
man
was
in
gaol
in
gaol
for
five
years
covers
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
the
crushing
shame
of
it
with
increased
vehemence
and
then
to
think
of
all
that
the
name
of
john
gabriel
borkman
used
to
mean
no
no
no
i
can
never
see
him
again
never
ella
rentheim
looks
at
her
for
a
while
you
have
a
hard
heart
gunhild
borkman
towards
him
yes
ella
rentheim
after
all
he
is
your
husband
borkman
did
he
not
say
in
court
that
it
was
i
who
began
his
ruin
that
i
spent
money
so
recklessly
ella
rentheim
tentatively
but
is
there
not
some
truth
in
that
borkman
why
it
was
he
himself
that
made
me
do
it
he
insisted
on
our
living
in
such
an
absurdly
lavish
style
ella
rentheim
yes
i
know
but
that
is
just
where
you
should
have
restrained
him
and
apparently
you
did
borkman
how
was
i
to
know
that
it
was
not
his
own
money
he
gave
me
to
squander
and
that
he
himself
used
to
squander
too
ten
times
more
than
i
did
ella
rentheim
quietly
well
i
daresay
his
position
forced
him
to
do
that
to
some
extent
at
any
rate
borkman
scornfully
yes
it
was
always
the
same
story
we
were
to
cut
a
figure
and
he
did
cut
a
figure
to
some
purpose
he
used
to
drive
about
with
a
as
if
he
were
a
king
and
he
had
people
bowing
and
scraping
to
him
just
as
to
a
king
with
a
laugh
and
they
always
called
him
by
his
christian
names
all
the
country
over
as
if
he
had
been
the
king
himself
john
gabriel
john
gabriel
john
gabriel
every
one
knew
what
a
great
man
john
gabriel
was
ella
rentheim
warmly
and
emphatically
he
was
a
great
man
then
borkman
yes
to
all
appearance
but
he
never
breathed
a
single
word
to
me
as
to
his
real
position
never
gave
a
hint
as
to
where
he
got
his
means
from
ella
rentheim
no
no
and
other
people
did
not
dream
of
it
either
borkman
i
do
care
about
the
other
people
but
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
me
the
truth
and
that
he
never
did
he
kept
on
lying
to
me
lying
abominably
ella
rentheim
interrupting
surely
not
gunhild
he
kept
things
back
perhaps
but
i
am
sure
he
did
not
lie
borkman
well
well
call
it
what
you
please
it
makes
no
difference
and
then
it
all
fell
to
pieces
the
whole
thing
ella
rentheim
to
herself
yes
everything
fell
to
pieces
for
him
and
for
others
borkman
drawing
herself
up
menacingly
but
i
tell
you
this
ella
i
do
not
give
in
yet
i
shall
redeem
myself
yet
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
ella
rentheim
eagerly
redeem
yourself
what
do
you
mean
by
that
borkman
redeem
my
name
and
honour
and
fortune
redeem
my
ruined
life
that
is
what
i
mean
i
have
some
one
in
reserve
let
me
tell
you
one
who
will
wash
away
every
stain
that
he
has
left
ella
rentheim
gunhild
gunhild
borkman
with
rising
excitement
there
is
an
avenger
living
i
tell
you
one
who
will
make
up
to
me
for
all
his
father
sins
ella
rentheim
erhart
you
mean
borkman
yes
erhart
my
own
boy
he
will
redeem
the
family
the
house
the
name
all
that
can
be
and
perhaps
more
besides
ella
rentheim
and
how
do
you
think
that
is
to
be
done
borkman
it
must
be
done
as
best
it
can
i
do
know
how
but
i
know
that
it
must
and
shall
be
done
looks
searchingly
at
her
come
now
ella
is
that
really
what
you
have
had
in
mind
too
ever
since
he
was
a
child
ella
rentheim
no
i
ca
exactly
say
that
borkman
no
then
why
did
you
take
charge
of
him
when
the
storm
broke
upon
upon
this
house
ella
rentheim
you
could
not
look
after
him
yourself
at
that
time
gunhild
borkman
no
no
i
could
not
and
his
father
he
had
a
valid
enough
excuse
while
he
was
there
in
safe
keeping
ella
rentheim
indignant
oh
how
can
you
say
such
things
you
borkman
with
a
venomous
expression
and
how
could
you
make
up
your
mind
to
take
charge
of
the
child
of
a
a
john
gabriel
just
as
if
he
had
been
your
own
to
take
the
child
away
from
me
home
with
you
and
keep
him
there
year
after
year
until
the
boy
was
nearly
grown
up
looking
suspiciously
at
her
what
was
your
real
reason
ella
why
did
you
keep
him
with
you
ella
rentheim
i
came
to
love
him
so
dearly
borkman
more
than
i
his
mother
ella
rentheim
evasively
i
do
know
about
that
and
then
you
know
erhart
was
rather
delicate
as
a
child
borkman
erhart
delicate
ella
rentheim
yes
i
thought
so
at
that
time
at
any
rate
and
you
know
the
air
of
the
west
coast
is
so
much
milder
than
here
borkman
smiling
bitterly
h
is
it
indeed
breaking
off
yes
it
is
true
you
have
done
a
great
deal
for
erhart
with
a
change
of
tone
well
of
course
you
could
afford
it
smiling
you
were
so
lucky
ella
you
managed
to
save
all
your
money
ella
rentheim
hurt
i
did
not
manage
anything
about
it
i
assure
you
i
had
no
idea
until
long
long
afterwards
that
the
securities
belonging
to
me
that
they
had
been
left
untouched
borkman
well
well
i
do
understand
anything
about
these
things
i
only
say
you
were
lucky
looking
inquiringly
at
her
but
when
you
of
your
own
accord
undertook
to
educate
erhart
for
me
what
was
your
motive
in
that
ella
rentheim
looking
at
her
my
motive
borkman
yes
some
motive
you
must
have
had
what
did
you
want
to
do
with
him
to
make
of
him
i
mean
ella
rentheim
slowly
i
wanted
to
smooth
the
way
for
erhart
to
happiness
in
life
borkman
contemptuously
pooh
people
situated
as
we
are
have
something
else
than
happiness
to
think
of
ella
rentheim
what
then
borkman
looking
steadily
and
earnestly
at
her
erhart
has
in
the
first
place
to
make
so
brilliant
a
position
for
himself
that
no
trace
shall
be
left
of
the
shadow
his
father
has
cast
upon
my
name
and
my
son
ella
rentheim
searchingly
tell
me
gunhild
is
this
what
erhart
himself
demands
of
his
life
borkman
slightly
taken
aback
yes
i
should
hope
so
ella
rentheim
is
it
not
rather
what
you
demand
of
him
borkman
curtly
erhart
and
i
always
make
the
same
demands
upon
ourselves
ella
rentheim
sadly
and
slowly
you
are
so
very
certain
of
your
boy
then
gunhild
borkman
with
veiled
triumph
yes
that
i
am
thank
heaven
you
may
be
sure
of
that
ella
rentheim
then
i
should
think
in
reality
you
must
be
happy
after
all
in
spite
of
all
the
rest
borkman
so
i
am
so
far
as
that
goes
but
then
every
moment
all
the
rest
comes
rushing
in
upon
me
like
a
storm
ella
rentheim
with
a
change
of
tone
tell
me
you
may
as
well
tell
me
at
once
for
that
is
really
what
i
have
come
for
borkman
what
ella
rentheim
something
i
felt
i
must
talk
to
you
tell
me
erhart
does
not
live
out
here
with
with
you
others
borkman
harshly
erhart
can
not
live
out
here
with
me
he
has
to
live
in
town
ella
rentheim
so
he
wrote
to
me
borkman
he
must
for
the
sake
of
his
studies
but
he
comes
out
to
me
for
a
little
while
every
evening
ella
rentheim
well
may
i
see
him
then
may
i
speak
to
him
at
once
borkman
he
has
not
come
yet
but
i
expect
him
every
moment
ella
rentheim
why
gunhild
surely
he
must
have
come
i
can
hear
his
footsteps
overhead
borkman
with
a
rapid
upward
glance
up
in
the
long
gallery
ella
rentheim
yes
i
have
heard
him
walking
up
and
down
there
ever
since
i
came
borkman
looking
away
from
her
that
is
not
erhart
ella
ella
rentheim
surprised
not
erhart
divining
who
is
it
then
borkman
it
is
he
ella
rentheim
softly
with
suppressed
pain
borkman
john
gabriel
borkman
borkman
he
walks
up
and
down
like
that
backwards
and
forwards
from
morning
to
night
day
out
and
day
in
ella
rentheim
i
have
heard
something
of
this
borkman
i
daresay
people
find
plenty
to
say
about
us
no
doubt
ella
rentheim
erhart
has
spoken
of
it
in
his
letters
he
said
that
his
father
generally
remained
by
himself
up
there
and
you
alone
down
here
borkman
yes
that
is
how
it
has
been
ella
ever
since
they
let
him
out
and
sent
him
home
to
me
all
these
long
eight
years
ella
rentheim
i
never
believed
it
could
really
be
so
it
seemed
impossible
borkman
nods
it
is
so
and
it
can
never
be
otherwise
ella
rentheim
looking
at
her
this
must
be
a
terrible
life
gunhild
borkman
worse
than
terrible
almost
unendurable
ella
rentheim
yes
it
must
be
borkman
always
to
hear
his
footsteps
up
there
from
early
morning
till
far
into
the
night
and
everything
sounds
so
clear
in
this
house
ella
rentheim
yes
it
is
strange
how
clear
the
sound
is
borkman
i
often
feel
as
if
i
had
a
sick
wolf
pacing
his
cage
up
there
in
the
gallery
right
over
my
head
listens
and
whispers
hark
do
you
hear
backwards
and
forwards
up
and
down
goes
the
wolf
ella
rentheim
tentatively
is
no
change
possible
gunhild
borkman
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
he
has
never
made
any
movement
towards
a
change
ella
rentheim
could
you
not
make
the
first
movement
then
borkman
indignantly
i
after
all
the
wrong
he
has
done
me
no
thank
you
rather
let
the
wolf
go
on
prowling
up
there
ella
rentheim
this
room
is
too
hot
for
me
you
must
let
me
take
off
my
things
after
all
borkman
yes
i
asked
you
to
ella
rentheim
takes
off
her
hat
and
cloak
and
lays
them
on
a
chair
beside
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
ella
rentheim
do
you
never
happen
to
meet
him
away
from
home
borkman
with
a
bitter
laugh
in
society
do
you
mean
ella
rentheim
i
mean
when
he
goes
out
walking
in
the
woods
or
borkman
he
never
goes
out
ella
rentheim
not
even
in
the
twilight
borkman
never
ella
rentheim
with
emotion
he
can
not
bring
himself
to
go
out
borkman
i
suppose
not
he
has
his
great
cloak
and
his
hat
hanging
in
the
cupboard
the
cupboard
in
the
hall
you
know
ella
rentheim
to
herself
the
cupboard
we
used
to
hide
in
when
we
were
little
borkman
nods
and
now
and
then
late
in
the
evening
i
can
hear
him
come
down
as
though
to
go
out
but
he
always
stops
when
he
is
halfway
downstairs
and
turns
back
straight
back
to
the
gallery
ella
rentheim
quietly
do
none
of
his
old
friends
ever
come
up
to
see
him
borkman
he
has
no
old
friends
ella
rentheim
he
had
so
many
once
borkman
h
he
took
the
best
possible
way
to
get
rid
of
them
he
was
a
dear
friend
to
his
friends
was
john
gabriel
ella
rentheim
oh
yes
that
is
true
gunhild
borkman
vehemently
all
the
same
i
call
it
mean
petty
base
contemptible
of
them
to
think
so
much
of
the
paltry
losses
they
may
have
suffered
through
him
they
were
only
money
losses
nothing
more
ella
rentheim
not
answering
her
so
he
lives
up
there
quite
alone
absolutely
by
himself
borkman
yes
practically
so
they
tell
me
an
old
clerk
or
copyist
or
something
comes
out
to
see
him
now
and
then
ella
rentheim
ah
indeed
no
doubt
it
is
a
man
called
foldal
i
know
they
were
friends
as
young
men
borkman
yes
i
believe
they
were
but
i
know
nothing
about
him
he
was
quite
outside
our
circle
when
we
had
a
circle
ella
rentheim
so
he
comes
out
to
see
borkman
now
borkman
yes
he
condescends
to
but
of
course
he
only
comes
when
it
is
dark
ella
rentheim
this
foldal
he
was
one
of
those
that
suffered
when
the
bank
failed
borkman
carelessly
yes
i
believe
i
heard
he
had
lost
some
money
but
no
doubt
it
was
something
quite
trifling
ella
rentheim
with
slight
emphasis
it
was
all
he
possessed
borkman
smiling
oh
well
what
he
possessed
must
have
been
little
enough
nothing
to
speak
of
ella
rentheim
and
he
did
not
speak
of
it
foldal
i
mean
during
the
investigation
borkman
at
all
events
i
can
assure
you
erhart
has
made
ample
amends
for
any
little
loss
he
may
have
suffered
ella
rentheim
with
surprise
erhart
how
can
erhart
have
done
that
borkman
he
has
taken
an
interest
in
foldal
youngest
daughter
he
has
taught
her
things
and
put
her
in
the
way
of
getting
employment
and
some
day
providing
for
herself
i
am
sure
that
is
a
great
deal
more
than
her
father
could
ever
have
done
for
her
ella
rentheim
yes
i
daresay
her
father
ca
afford
to
do
much
borkman
and
then
erhart
has
arranged
for
her
to
have
lessons
in
music
she
has
made
such
progress
already
that
she
can
come
up
to
to
him
in
the
gallery
and
play
to
him
ella
rentheim
so
he
is
still
fond
of
music
borkman
oh
yes
i
suppose
he
is
of
course
he
has
the
piano
you
sent
out
here
when
he
was
expected
back
ella
rentheim
and
she
plays
to
him
on
it
borkman
yes
now
and
then
in
the
evenings
that
is
erhart
doing
too
ella
rentheim
has
the
poor
girl
to
come
all
the
long
way
out
here
and
then
back
to
town
again
borkman
no
she
does
need
to
erhart
has
arranged
for
her
to
stay
with
a
lady
who
lives
near
us
a
wilton
ella
rentheim
with
interest
wilton
borkman
a
very
rich
woman
you
do
know
her
ella
rentheim
i
have
heard
her
name
fanny
wilton
is
it
not
borkman
yes
quite
right
ella
rentheim
erhart
has
mentioned
her
several
times
does
she
live
out
here
now
borkman
yes
she
has
taken
a
villa
here
she
moved
out
from
town
some
time
ago
ella
rentheim
with
a
slight
hesitation
they
say
she
is
divorced
from
her
husband
borkman
her
husband
has
been
dead
for
several
years
ella
rentheim
yes
but
they
were
divorced
he
got
a
divorce
borkman
he
deserted
her
that
is
what
he
did
i
am
sure
the
fault
was
hers
ella
rentheim
do
you
know
her
at
all
intimately
gunhild
borkman
oh
yes
pretty
well
she
lives
close
by
here
and
she
looks
in
every
now
and
then
ella
rentheim
and
do
you
like
her
borkman
she
is
unusually
intelligent
remarkably
clear
in
her
judgments
ella
rentheim
in
her
judgments
of
people
do
you
mean
borkman
yes
principally
of
people
she
has
made
quite
a
study
of
erhart
looked
deep
into
his
character
into
his
soul
and
the
result
is
she
idolises
him
as
she
could
not
help
doing
ella
rentheim
with
a
touch
of
finesse
then
perhaps
she
knows
erhart
still
better
than
she
knows
you
borkman
yes
erhart
saw
a
good
deal
of
her
in
town
before
she
came
out
here
ella
rentheim
without
thinking
and
in
spite
of
that
she
moved
out
of
town
borkman
taken
aback
looking
keenly
at
her
in
spite
of
that
what
do
you
mean
ella
rentheim
evasively
oh
nothing
particular
borkman
you
said
it
strangely
you
did
mean
something
by
it
ella
ella
rentheim
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
yes
that
is
true
gunhild
i
did
mean
something
by
it
borkman
well
then
say
it
right
out
ella
rentheim
first
let
me
tell
you
i
think
i
too
have
a
certain
claim
upon
erhart
do
you
think
i
have
borkman
glancing
round
the
room
no
doubt
after
all
the
money
you
have
spent
upon
him
ella
rentheim
oh
not
on
that
account
gunhild
but
because
i
love
him
borkman
smiling
scornfully
love
my
son
is
it
possible
you
in
spite
of
everything
ella
rentheim
yes
it
is
possible
in
spite
of
everything
and
it
is
true
i
love
erhart
as
much
as
i
can
love
any
one
now
at
my
time
of
life
borkman
well
well
suppose
you
do
what
then
ella
rentheim
why
then
i
am
troubled
as
soon
as
i
see
anything
threatening
him
borkman
threatening
erhart
why
what
should
threaten
him
or
who
ella
rentheim
you
in
the
first
place
in
your
way
borkman
vehemently
i
ella
rentheim
and
then
this
wilton
too
i
am
afraid
borkman
looks
at
her
for
a
moment
in
speechless
surprise
and
you
think
such
things
of
erhart
of
my
own
boy
he
who
has
his
great
mission
to
fulfil
ella
rentheim
lightly
oh
his
mission
borkman
indignantly
how
dare
you
say
that
so
scornfully
ella
rentheim
do
you
think
a
young
man
of
erhart
age
full
of
health
and
spirits
do
you
think
he
is
going
to
sacrifice
himself
for
for
such
a
thing
as
a
mission
borkman
firmly
and
emphatically
erhart
will
i
know
he
will
ella
rentheim
shaking
her
head
you
neither
know
it
nor
believe
it
gunhild
borkman
i
do
believe
it
ella
rentheim
it
is
only
a
dream
that
you
cherish
for
if
you
had
that
to
cling
to
you
feel
that
you
would
utterly
despair
borkman
yes
indeed
i
should
despair
vehemently
and
i
daresay
that
is
what
you
would
like
to
see
ella
ella
rentheim
with
head
erect
yes
i
would
rather
see
that
than
see
you
redeem
yourself
at
erhart
expense
borkman
threateningly
you
want
to
come
between
us
between
mother
and
son
you
ella
rentheim
i
want
to
free
him
from
your
power
your
will
your
despotism
borkman
triumphantly
you
are
too
late
you
had
him
in
your
nets
all
these
years
until
he
was
fifteen
but
now
i
have
won
him
again
you
see
ella
rentheim
then
i
will
win
him
back
from
you
hoarsely
half
whispering
we
two
have
fought
a
battle
before
gunhild
for
a
man
soul
borkman
looking
at
her
in
triumph
yes
and
i
won
the
victory
ella
rentheim
with
a
smile
of
scorn
do
you
still
think
that
victory
was
worth
the
winning
borkman
darkly
no
heaven
knows
you
are
right
there
ella
rentheim
you
need
look
for
no
victory
worth
the
winning
this
time
either
borkman
not
when
i
am
fighting
to
preserve
a
mother
power
over
my
son
ella
rentheim
no
for
it
is
only
power
over
him
that
you
want
borkman
and
you
ella
rentheim
warmly
i
want
his
affection
his
soul
his
whole
heart
borkman
with
an
outburst
that
you
shall
never
have
in
this
world
ella
rentheim
looking
at
her
you
have
seen
to
that
borkman
smiling
yes
i
have
taken
that
liberty
could
you
not
see
that
in
his
letters
ella
rentheim
nods
slowly
yes
i
could
see
you
the
whole
of
you
in
his
letters
of
late
borkman
gallingly
i
have
made
the
best
use
of
these
eight
years
i
have
had
him
under
my
own
eye
you
see
ella
rentheim
controlling
herself
what
have
you
said
to
erhart
about
me
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
tell
me
borkman
oh
yes
i
can
tell
you
well
enough
ella
rentheim
then
please
do
borkman
i
have
only
told
him
the
truth
ella
rentheim
well
borkman
i
have
impressed
upon
him
every
day
of
his
life
that
he
must
never
forget
that
it
is
you
we
have
to
thank
for
being
able
to
live
as
we
do
for
being
able
to
live
at
all
ella
rentheim
is
that
all
borkman
oh
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
rankles
i
feel
that
in
my
own
heart
ella
rentheim
but
that
is
very
much
what
erhart
knew
already
borkman
when
he
came
home
to
me
he
imagined
that
you
did
it
all
out
of
goodness
of
heart
looks
malignly
at
her
now
he
does
not
believe
that
any
longer
ella
ella
rentheim
then
what
does
he
believe
now
borkman
he
believes
what
is
the
truth
i
asked
him
how
he
accounted
for
the
fact
that
aunt
ella
never
came
here
to
visit
us
ella
rentheim
interrupting
he
knew
my
reasons
already
borkman
he
knows
them
better
now
you
had
got
him
to
believe
that
it
was
to
spare
me
and
and
him
up
there
in
gallery
ella
rentheim
and
so
it
was
borkman
erhart
does
not
believe
that
for
a
moment
now
ella
rentheim
what
have
you
put
in
his
head
borkman
he
thinks
what
is
the
truth
that
you
are
ashamed
of
us
that
you
despise
us
and
do
you
pretend
that
you
do
were
you
not
once
planning
to
take
him
quite
away
from
me
think
ella
you
can
not
have
forgotten
ella
rentheim
with
a
gesture
of
negation
that
was
at
the
height
of
the
scandal
when
the
case
was
before
the
courts
i
have
no
such
designs
now
borkman
and
it
would
not
matter
if
you
had
for
in
that
case
what
would
become
of
his
mission
no
thank
you
it
is
me
that
erhart
needs
not
you
and
therefore
he
is
as
good
as
dead
to
you
and
you
to
him
ella
rentheim
coldly
with
resolution
we
shall
see
for
now
i
shall
remain
out
here
borkman
stares
at
her
here
in
this
house
ella
rentheim

rentheim

arranged

know
borkman
can
hold
no
property
of
his
own

some
one

at
once
come
and
take
it
from
him
borkman
yes
i
know
we
must
be
content
to
live
upon
your
pity
and
charity
ella
rentheim
coldly
i
can
not
prevent
you
from
looking
at
it
in
that
light

hard
at

ella
rentheim
observes

little
impatient

nervous
and
colder
expression
the
maid
brings
the
lighted

ladies
of
the
house
to
bring
borkman
with
me
if
i
happened
to
see
him
borkman
and
you
did
happen
to
see
him
it
appears
wilton
yes
fortunately
he
was
good
enough
to
look
in
at
my
house
to
call
for
frida
borkman
drily
but
erhart
i
did
not
know
that
you

that
family
those
hinkels
erhart
irritated

do
exactly

impatiently
you

than
anybody

what
people
i
know
and
do
know
wilton
oh
it
does
matter
they
soon
put
you
at
your
ease
in
that
house
they
are
such
cheerful
hospitable
people
the
house
swarms
with
young
ladies
borkman
with
emphasis
if
i
know
my
son
rightly
wilton
they
are
no
fit
company
for
him
wilton
why
good
gracious
dear
lady
he
is
young

young
erhart
concealing
his
impatience
well
well
well
mother
quite
clear
i
ca
got
to
the
hinkels
this
evening
of
course
i
shall
remain
here
with
you
and
aunt
ella
borkman
i
knew
you
would
my
dear
erhart
ella
rentheim
no
erhart
you
must
not
stop
at
home
on
my
account
erhart
yes
indeed
my
dear
aunt
i
ca
think
of
going
looking
doubtfully
at
mrs
wilton
but
how
shall
we
manage
can
i
get
out
of
it
you
have
said
yes
for
me
have
you
wilton
gaily
what
nonsense
not
get
out
of
it
when
i
make
my
entrance
into
the
festive
halls
just
imagine
it
deserted
and
forlorn
then
i
must
simply
say
no
for
you
erhart
hesitatingly
well
if
you
really
think
i
can
get
out
of
it
wilton
putting
the
matter
lightly
aside
i
am
quite
used
to
saying
both
yes
and
no
on
my
own
account
and
you
ca
possibly
think
of
leaving
your
aunt
the
moment
she
has
arrived
for
shame
monsieur
erhart
would
that
be
behaving
like
a
good
son
borkman
annoyed
son
wilton
well
adopted
son
then
borkman
borkman
yes
you
may
well
add
that
wilton
oh
it
seems
to
me
we
have
often
more
cause
to
be
grateful
to
a
than
to
our
own
mother
borkman
has
that
been
your
experience
wilton
i
knew
very
little
of
my
own
mother
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
if
i
had
had
a
good
perhaps
i
should
have
been
so
so
naughty
as
people
say
i
am
turning
towards
erhart
well
then
we
stop
peaceably
at
home
like
a
good
boy
and
drink
tea
with
mamma
and
auntie
to
the
ladies
borkman
miss
rentheim
the
ladies
bow
silently
she
goes
toward
the
door
erhart
following
her
sha
i
go
a
little
bit
of
the
way
with
you
wilton
in
the
doorway
motioning
him
back
you
sha
go
a
step
with
me
i
am
quite
accustomed
to
taking
my
walks
alone
stops
on
the
threshold
looks
at
him
and
nods
but
now
beware
borkman
i
warn
you
erhart
what
am
i
to
beware
of
wilton
gaily
why
as
i
go
down
the
road
deserted
and
forlorn
as
i
said
before
i
shall
try
if
i
ca
cast
a
spell
upon
you
erhart
laughing
oh
indeed
are
you
going
to
try
that
again
wilton
half
seriously
yes
just
you
beware
as
i
go
down
the
road
i
will
say
in
my
own
mind
right
from
the
very
centre
of
my
will
i
will
say
erhart
borkman
take
your
hat
at
once
borkman
and
you
think
he
will
take
it
wilton
laughing
good
heavens
yes
he
snatch
up
his
hat
instantly
and
then
i
will
say
now
put
on
your
overcoat
like
a
good
boy
erhart
borkman
and
your
goloshes
be
sure
you
forget
the
goloshes
and
then
follow
me
do
as
i
bid
you
as
i
bid
you
as
i
bid
you
erhart
with
forced
gaiety
oh
you
may
rely
on
that
wilton
raising
her
forefinger
as
i
bid
you
as
i
bid
you
she
laughs
and
nods
to
the
ladies
and
closes
the
door
behind
her
borkman
does
she
really
play
tricks
of
that
sort
erhart
oh
not
at
all
how
can
you
think
so
she
only
says
it
in
fun
breaking
off
but
do
let
us
talk
about
wilton
he
forces
ella
rentheim
to
seat
herself
at
the
armchair
beside
the
stove
then
stands
and
looks
at
her
to
think
of
your
having
taken
all
this
long
journey
aunt
ella
and
in
winter
too
ella
rentheim
i
found
i
had
to
erhart
erhart
indeed
why
so
ella
rentheim
i
had
to
come
to
town
after
all
to
consult
the
doctors

glad
of
that
ella
rentheim
smiling
are
you
glad
of
that
erhart

you
ill
ella
ella
rentheim
looking
hardly
at

you
know
quite
well
that

am
borkman
i
knew

were
not
strong
and
had
been
for
years
erhart
i
told
you
before
i
left
you
that
you
ought
to
consult
a
doctor
ella
rentheim
there
is
no
one
in
my
neighbourhood
that
i
have
any
real
confidence
in
and
besides
i
did
not
feel
it
so
much
at
that
time
erhart
are
you
worse
then
aunt
ella
rentheim
yes
my
dear
boy
i
am
worse
now

but
there
nothing
dangerous

that
depends
how
you
look
at
it
erhart
emphatically
well
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
aunt
ella
you
must
think
of
going
home
again
for
the
present
ella
rentheim
no
i
am
not
thinking
of
it
erhart
you
must
remain
in
town
for
here
you
can
have
your
choice
of
all
the
best
doctors
ella
rentheim
that
was
what
i
thought
when
i
left
home
erhart
and
then
you
must
be
sure
and
find
a
really
nice
place
to
live
quiet
comfortable
rooms
ella
rentheim
i
went
this
morning
to
the
old
ones
where
i
used
to
stay
before
erhart
oh
well
you
were
comfortable
enough
there
ella
rentheim
yes
but
i
shall
not
be
staying
there
after
all
erhart
indeed
why
not
ella
rentheim
i
changed
my
mind
after
coming
out
here
erhart
surprised
really
changed
you
mind
borkman
crocheting
without
looking
up
your
aunt
will
live
here
in
her
own
house
erhart
erhart
looking
from
one
to
the
other
alternately
here
with
us
is
this
true
aunt
ella
rentheim
yes
that
is
what
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
borkman
as
before
everything
here
belongs
to
your
aunt
you
know
ella
rentheim
i
intend
to
remain
here
erhart
just
now
for
the
present
i
shall
set
up
a
little
establishment
of
my
own
over
in
the
bailiff
wing
erhart
ah
that
a
good
idea
there
are
plenty
of
rooms
there
with
sudden
vivacity
but
aunt
are
you
very
tired
after
your
journey
ella
rentheim
oh
yes
rather
tired
erhart
well
then
i
think
you
ought
to
go
quite
early
to
bed
ella
rentheim
looks
at
him
smilingly
i
mean
to
erhart
eagerly
and
then
we
could
have
a
good
long
talk
or
some
other
day
of
course
about
this
and
that
about
things
in
general
you
and
mother
and
i
would
that
be
much
the
best
plan
aunt
ella
borkman
with
an
outburst
rising
from
the
sofa
erhart
i
can
see
you
are
going
to
leave
me
erhart
starts
what
do
you
mean
by
that
borkman
you
are
going
down
to
to
the
hinkels
erhart
involuntarily

invalid
mother
borkman
you
are
going
to
the
hinkels

ella
rentheim

should
like
you
to
feel
quite

erhart
borkman

could
gunhild

away
from
your
mother

that
is
what
you
want

with
passionate
emotion

want
to
go
away
from

those
strange
people

short
silence
it
has
not
taken
you
long
to
recapture
him
ella
after
all

she
than
you
ella
rentheim
whatever

become
of
him
in
the
end

for
the
first
time
in

lives

music

still
for
a
moment
starts
shrinks
together
and
whispers
involuntarily
the
wolf
is
whining
again
the
sick
wolf
she
stands
still
for
a
moment
then
flings
herself
down
on
the
floor
writhing
in
agony
and
whispering
erhart

to
me

of
middle
height
a
man
well
on
in
the
sixties

appearance

distinguished

profile
finely
cut
his
eyes
piercing
his
hair
and
beard
curly
and
he
is
dressed
in
a
slightly
black
coat
and
wears

a
somewhat
weary
and
overstrained
expression

is
cheaply
dressed
in
light
colours

can
you
guess
where
i
first
heard
tones
like
these
frida
looking
up
at
him
no
borkman
borkman
it
was
down
in
the
mines
frida
not

sometimes
to
take
me
with
him
into
the
mines

metal
sings
down
there

really
sings
borkman
nodding
when
it
is
loosened
the
that
loosen
it
are
the
midnight
bell
clanging
to
set
it
free
and
that
is
why
the
metal
sings
in
its
own
way
for
gladness
frida
why
does
it
do
that
borkman
borkman
it
wants
to
come
up
into
the
light
of
day
and
serve
mankind
he
paces
up
and
down
the
gallery
always
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
frida
sits
waiting
a
little
then
looks
at
her
watch
and
rises
i
beg
your
pardon
borkman
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
borkman
stopping
before
her
are
you
going
already
frida
putting
her
music
in
its
case
i
really
must
visibly

have
an
engagement
this
evening

for
a
party
frida
yes
borkman
and
you
are
to
play
before
the
company
frida
biting
her
lip
no
at
least
i

only
to
play
for
dancing
borkman
only
for
dancing
frida
yes

be
a
dance

and
looks
at

at
parties
i
mean
frida
putting
on
her
outdoor
things
yes
when
i
can
get
an
engagement
i
can
always
earn
a
little
in
that
way
borkman
with
interest
is
that
the
principal
thing
in
your
mind
as
you
sit
playing
for
the
dancers
frida
no
i
generally
thinking
how
hard
it
is
that
i
may
join
in
the
dance
myself
borkman
nodding
that
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
moving
restlessly
about
the
room
yes
yes
yes
that
you
must
not
join
in
the
dance
that
is
the
hardest
thing
of
all
stopping
but
there
is
one
thing
that
should
make
up
to
you
for
that
frida
frida
looking
inquiringly
at
him
what
is
that
borkman
borkman
the
knowledge
that
you
have
ten
times
more
music
in
you
than
all
the
dancers
together
frida
smiling
evasively
oh
that
not
at
all
so
certain
borkman
holding
up
his
warningly
you
must
never
be
so
mad
as
to
have
doubts
of
yourself
frida
but
since
no
one
knows
it
borkman
so
long
as
you
know
it
yourself
that
is
enough
where
is
it
you
are
going
to
play
this
evening
frida
over
at
the
hinkel
borkman
with
a
swift
keen
glance
at
her
hinkel
you
say
frida
yes
borkman
with
a
cutting
smile
does
that
man
give
parties
can
he
get
people
to
visit
him
frida
yes
they
have
a
great
many
people
about
them
wilton
says
borkman
vehemently
but
what
sort
of
people
can
you
tell
me
that
frida
a
little
nervously
no
i
really
do
know
yes
i
know
that
young
borkman
is
to
be
there
this
evening
borkman
taken
aback
erhart
my
son
frida
yes
he
is
going
there
borkman
how
do
you
know
that
frida
he
said
so
himself
an
hour
ago

out
here
frida

has
been
at
wilton

the
afternoon
borkman
inquiringly

know
if

called
here
too
i
mean
did
he
see
any
one
downstairs
frida
yes
he
looked
in
to
see
borkman
borkman
bitterly
aha
i
might
have
known
it
frida
there
was
a
strange
lady
calling
upon
her
i
think
borkman
indeed
was
there
oh
yes
i
suppose
people
do
come
now
and
then
to
see
borkman
frida
if
i
meet
young
borkman
this
evening
shall
i
ask
him
to
come
up
and
see
you
too
borkman
harshly
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
wo
have
it
on
any
account
the
people
who
want
to
see
me
can
come
of
their
own
accord
frida
oh
very
well
i
sha
say
anything
then
borkman
borkman
pacing
up
and
down
and
growling
frida
do
you
mind
if
i
run
down
by
the
winding
stair
it
the
shortest
way
borkman
oh
by
all
means
take
whatever
stair
you
please
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
to
you
frida
borkman
she
goes
out
by
the
little
tapestry
door
in
the
back
on
the
left
borkman
lost
in
thought
goes
up
to
the
piano
and
is
about
to
close
it
but
changes
his
mind
looks
round
the
great
empty
room
and
sets
to
pacing
up
and
down
it
from
the
corner
at
the
back
on
the
right
pacing
backward
and
forward
uneasily
and
incessantly
at
last
he
goes
up
to
the
listens
in
the
direction
of
the
folding
door
hastily
snatches
up
a
looks
at
himself
in
it
and
straightens
his
necktie
a
knock
at
the
folding
door
borkman
hears
it
looks
rapidly
towards
the
door
but
says
nothing
in
a
little
there
comes
another
knock
this
time
louder
borkman
standing
beside
the
with
his
left
hand
resting
upon
it
and
his
right
thrust
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
come
in
vilhelm
foldal
comes
softly
into
the
room
he
is
a
bent
and
worn
man
with
mild
blue
eyes
and
long
thin
grey
hair
straggling
down
over
his
coat
collar
he
has
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
a
soft
felt
hat
and
large
horn
spectacles
which
he
pushes
up
over
his
forehead
borkman
changes
his
attitude
and
looks
at
foldal
with
a
half
disappointed
half
pleased
expression
oh
is
it
only
you
foldal
good
evening
john
gabriel
yes
you
see
it
is
me
borkman
with
a
stern
glance
i
must
say
you
are
rather
a
late
visitor
foldal
well
you
know
it
a
good
bit
of
a
way
especially
when
you
have
to
trudge
it
on
foot
borkman
but
why
do
you
always
walk
vilhelm
the
tramway
passes
your
door
foldal
it
better
for
you
to
walk
and
then
you
always
save
twopence
well
has
frida
been
playing
to
you
lately
borkman
she
has
just
this
moment
gone
did
you
not
meet
her
outside
foldal
no
i
have
seen
nothing
of
her
for
a
long
time
not
since
she
went
to
live
with
this
wilton
borkman
seating
himself
on
the
sofa
and
waving
his
hand
toward
a
chair
you
may
sit
down
vilhelm
foldal
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
many
thanks
looks
mournfully
at
him
you
ca
think
how
lonely
i
feel
since
frida
left
home
borkman
oh
come
you
have
plenty
left
foldal
yes
god
knows
i
have
five
of
them
but
frida
was
the
only
one
who
at
all
understood
me
shaking
his
head
sadly
the
others
do
understand
me
a
bit
borkman
gloomily
gazing
straight
before
him
and
drumming
on
the
table
with
his
fingers
no
that
just
it
that
is
the
curse
we
exceptional
chosen
people
have
to
bear
the
common
herd
the
average
man
and
woman
they
do
not
understand
us
vilhelm
foldal
with
resignation
if
it
were
only
the
lack
of
understanding
with
a
little
patience
one
could
manage
to
wait
for
that
awhile
yet
his
voice
choked
with
tears
but
there
is
something
still
bitterer
borkman
vehemently
there
is
nothing
bitterer
than
that
foldal
yes
there
is
john
gabriel
i
have
gone
through
a
domestic
scene
just
before
i
started
borkman
indeed
what
about
foldal
with
an
outburst
my
people
at
home
they
despise
me
borkman
indignantly
despise
foldal
wiping
his
eyes
i
have
long
known
it
but
it
came
out
unmistakably
borkman
after
a
short
silence
you
made
an
unwise
choice
i
fear
when
you
married
foldal
i
had
practically
no
choice
in
the
matter
and
you
see
one
feels
a
need
for
companionship
as
one
begins
to
get
on
in
years
and
so
crushed
as
i
then
was
so
utterly
broken
down
borkman
jumping
up
in
anger
is
this
meant
for
me
a
reproach
foldal
alarmed
no
no
for
heaven
sake
john
gabriel
borkman
yes
you
are
thinking
of
the
disaster
to
the
bank
i
can
see
you
are
foldal
soothingly
but
i
do
blame
you
for
that
heaven
forbid
borkman
growling
resumes
his
seat
well
that
is
a
good
thing
at
any
rate
foldal
besides
you
must
think
it
is
my
wife
that
i
complain
of
it
is
true
she
has
not
much
polish
poor
thing
but
she
is
a
good
sort
of
woman
all
the
same
no
it
the
children
borkman
i
thought
as
much
foldal
for
the
children
well
they
have
more
culture
and
therefore
they
expect
more
of
life
borkman
looking
at
him
sympathetically
and
so
your
children
despise
you
vilhelm
foldal
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
have
made
much
of
a
career
you
see
there
is
no
denying
that
borkman
moving
nearer
to
him
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
arm
do
they
not
know
then
that
in
your
young
days
you
wrote
a
tragedy
foldal
yes
of
course
they
know
that
but
it
does
seem
to
make
much
impression
on
them
borkman
then
they
do
understand
these
things
for
your
tragedy
is
good
i
am
firmly
convinced
of
that
foldal
brightening
up
yes
do
you
think
there
are
some
good
things
in
it
john
gabriel
good
god
if
i
could
only
manage
to
get
it
placed
opens
his
portfolio
and
begins
eagerly
turning
over
the
contents
look
here
just
let
me
show
you
one
or
two
alterations
i
have
made
borkman
have
you
it
with
you
foldal
yes
i
thought
i
would
bring
it
it
so
long
now
since
i
have
read
it
to
you
and
i
thought
perhaps
it
might
amuse
you
to
hear
an
act
or
two
borkman
rising
with
a
negative
gesture
no
no
we
will
keep
that
for
another
time
foldal
well
well
as
you
please
borkman
paces
up
and
down
the
room
foldal
puts
the
manuscript
up
again
borkman
stopping
in
front
of
him
you
are
quite
right
in
what
you
said
just
now
you
have
not
made
any
career
but
i
promise
you
this
vilhelm
that
when
once
the
hour
of
my
restoration
strikes
foldal
making
a
movement
to
rise
oh
thanks
thanks
borkman
waving
his
hand
no
please
be
seated
with
rising
excitement
when
the
hour
of
my
restoration
strikes
when
they
see
that
they
can
not
get
on
without
me
when
they
come
to
me
here
in
the
gallery
and
crawl
to
my
feet
and
beseech
me
to
take
the
reins
of
the
bank
again
the
new
bank
that
they
have
founded
and
ca
carry
on
placing
himself
beside
the
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
and
striking
his
breast
here
i
shall
stand
and
receive
them
and
it
shall
be
known
far
and
wide
all
the
country
over
what
conditions
john
gabriel
borkman
imposes
before
he
will
stopping
suddenly
and
staring
at
foldal
you
looking
so
doubtfully
at
me
perhaps
you
do
not
believe
that
they
will
come
that
they
must
must
must
come
to
me
some
day
do
you
not
believe
it
foldal
yes
heaven
knows
i
do
john
gabriel
borkman
seating
himself
again
on
the
sofa
i
firmly
believe
it
i
am
immovably
convinced
i
know
that
they
will
come
if
i
had
not
been
certain
of
that
i
would
have
put
a
bullet
through
my
head
long
ago
foldal
anxiously
oh
no
for
heaven
sake
borkman
exultantly
but
they
will
come
they
will
come
sure
enough
you
shall
see
i
expect
them
any
day
any
moment
and
you
see
i
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
receive
them
foldal
with
a
sigh
if
only
they
would
come
quickly
borkman
restlessly
yes
time
flies
the
years
slip
away
life
ah
no
i
dare
not
think
of
it
looking
at
him
do
you
know
what
i
sometimes
feel
like
foldal
what
borkman
i
feel
like
a
napoleon
who
has
been
maimed
in
his
first
battle
foldal
placing
his
hand
upon
his
portfolio
i
have
that
feeling
too
borkman
oh
well
that
is
on
a
smaller
scale
of
course
foldal
quietly
my
little
world
of
poetry
is
very
precious
to
me
john
gabriel
borkman
vehemently
yes
but
think
of
me
who
could
have
created
millions
all
the
mines
i
should
have
controlled
new
veins
innumerable
and
the
and
the
quarries
and
the
trade
routes
and
the
all
the
wide
world
over
i
would
have
organised
it
all
i
alone
foldal
yes
i
know
i
know
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
you
would
have
shrunk
from
borkman
clenching
his
hands
together
and
now
i
have
to
sit
here
like
a
wounded
eagle
and
look
on
while
others
pass
me
in
the
race
and
take
everything
away
from
me
piece
by
piece
foldal
that
is
my
fate
too
borkman
not
noticing
him
only
to
think
of
it
so
near
to
the
goal
as
i
was
if
i
had
only
had
another
week
to
look
about
me
all
the
deposits
would
have
been
covered
all
the
securities
i
had
dealt
with
so
daringly
should
have
been
in
their
places
again
as
before
vast
companies
were
within
a
of
being
floated
not
a
soul
should
have
lost
a
foldal
yes
yes
you
were
on
the
very
verge
of
success
borkman
with
suppressed
fury
and
then
treachery
overtook
me
just
at
the
critical
moment
looking
at
him
do
you
know
what
i
hold
to
be
the
most
infamous
crime
a
man
can
be
guilty
of
foldal
no
tell
me
borkman
it
is
not
murder
it
is
not
robbery
or
it
is
not
even
perjury
for
all
these
things
people
do
to
those
they
hate
or
who
are
indifferent
to
them
and
do
not
matter
foldal
what
is
the
worst
of
all
then
john
gabriel
borkman
with
emphasis
the
most
infamous
of
crimes
is
a
betrayal
of
his
friend
confidence
foldal
somewhat
doubtfully
yes
but
you
know
borkman
firing
up
what
are
you
going
to
say
i
see
it
in
your
face
but
it
is
of
no
use
the
people
who
had
their
securities
in
the
bank
should
have
got
them
all
back
again
every
farthing
no
i
tell
you
the
most
infamous
crime
a
man
can
commit
is
to
misuse
a
friend
letters
to
publish
to
all
the
world
what
has
been
confided
to
him
alone
in
the
closest
secrecy
like
a
whisper
in
an
empty
dark
room
the
man
who
can
do
such
things
is
infected
and
poisoned
in
every
fibre
with
the
morals
of
the
higher
rascality
and
such
a
friend
was
mine
and
it
was
he
who
crushed
me
foldal
i
can
guess
whom
you
mean
borkman
there
was
not
a
nook
or
cranny
of
my
life
that
i
hesitated
to
lay
open
to
him
and
then
when
the
moment
came
he
turned
against
me
the
weapons
i
myself
had
placed
in
his
hands
foldal
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
why
he
of
course
there
were
whispers
of
all
sorts
at
the
time
borkman
what
were
the
whispers
tell
me
you
see
i
know
nothing
for
i
had
to
go
straight
into
into
isolation
what
did
people
whisper
vilhelm
foldal
you
were
to
have
gone
into
the
cabinet
they
said
borkman
i
was
offered
a
portfolio
but
i
refused
it
foldal
then
it
was
there
you
stood
in
his
way
borkman
oh
no
that
was
not
the
reason
he
betrayed
me
foldal
then
i
really
ca
understand
borkman
i
may
as
well
tell
you
vilhelm
foldal
well
borkman
there
was
in
fact
there
was
a
woman
in
the
case
foldal
a
woman
in
the
case
well
but
john
gabriel
borkman
interrupting
well
well
let
us
say
no
more
of
these
stupid
old
stories
after
all
neither
of
us
got
into
the
cabinet
neither
he
nor
foldal
but
he
rose
high
in
the
world
borkman
and
i
fell
into
the
abyss
foldal
oh
it
a
terrible
tragedy
borkman
nodding
to
him
almost
as
terrible
as
yours
i
fancy
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
foldal
naively
yes
at
least
as
terrible
borkman
laughing
quietly
but
looked
at
from
another
point
of
view
it
is
really
a
sort
of
comedy
as
well
foldal
a
comedy
the
story
of
your
life
borkman
yes
it
seems
to
be
taking
a
turn
in
that
direction
for
let
me
tell
you
foldal
what
borkman
you
say
you
did
not
meet
frida
as
you
came
in
foldal
no
borkman
at
this
moment
as
we
sit
here
she
is
playing
waltzes
for
the
guests
of
the
man
who
betrayed
and
ruined
me
foldal
i
had
the
least
idea
of
that
borkman
yes
she
took
her
music
and
went
straight
from
me
to
to
the
great
house
foldal
apologetically
well
you
see
poor
child
borkman
and
can
you
guess
for
whom
she
is
playing
among
the
rest
foldal
no
borkman
for
my
son
foldal
what
borkman
what
do
you
think
of
that
vilhelm
my
son
is
down
there
in
the
whirl
of
the
dance
this
evening
am
i
not
right
in
calling
it
a
comedy
foldal
but
in
that
case
you
may
be
sure
he
knows
nothing
about
it
borkman
what
does
he
know
foldal
you
may
be
sure
he
does
know
how
he
that
man
borkman
do
not
shrink
from
his
name
i
can
quite
well
bear
it
now
foldal
i
certain
your
son
does
know
the
circumstances
john
gabriel
borkman
gloomily
sitting
and
beating
the
table
yes
he
knows
as
surely
as
i
am
sitting
here
foldal
then
how
can
he
possibly
be
a
guest
in
that
house
borkman
shaking
his
head
my
son
probably
does
not
see
things
with
my
eyes
i
take
my
oath
he
is
on
my
enemies
side
no
doubt
he
thinks
as
they
do
that
hinkel
only
did
his
confounded
duty
when
he
went
and
betrayed
me
foldal
but
my
dear
friend
who
can
have
got
him
to
see
things
in
that
light
borkman
who
do
you
forget
who
has
brought
him
up
first
his
aunt
from
the
time
he
was
six
or
seven
years
old
and
now
of
late
years
his
mother
foldal
i
believe
you
are
doing
them
an
injustice
borkman
firing
up
i
never
do
any
one
injustice
both
of
them
have
gone
and
poisoned
his
mind
against
me
i
tell
you
foldal
soothingly
well
well
well
i
suppose
they
have
borkman
indignantly
oh
these
women
they
wreck
and
ruin
life
for
us
play
the
devil
with
our
whole
destiny
our
triumphal
progress
foldal
not
all
of
them
borkman
indeed
can
you
tell
me
of
a
single
one
that
is
good
for
anything
foldal
no
that
is
the
trouble
the
few
that
i
know
are
good
for
nothing
borkman
with
a
snort
of
scorn
well
then
what
is
the
good
of
it
what
is
the
good
of
such
women
existing
if
you
never
know
them
foldal
warmly
yes
john
gabriel
there
is
good
in
it
i
assure
you
it
is
such
a
blessed
beneficial
thought
that
here
or
there
in
the
world
somewhere
far
away
the
true
woman
exists
after
all
borkman
moving
impatiently
on
the
sofa
oh
do
spare
me
that
poetical
nonsense
foldal
looks
at
him
deeply
wounded
do
you
call
my
holiest
faith
poetical
nonsense
borkman
harshly
yes
i
do
that
is
what
has
always
prevented
you
from
getting
on
in
the
world
if
you
would
get
all
that
out
of
your
head
i
could
still
help
you
on
in
life
help
you
to
rise
foldal
boiling
inwardly
oh
you
ca
do
that
borkman
i
can
when
once
i
come
into
power
again
foldal
that
wo
be
for
many
a
day
borkman
vehemently
perhaps
you
think
that
day
will
never
come
answer
me
foldal
i
do
know
what
to
answer
borkman
rising
cold
and
dignified
and
waving
his
hand
towards
the
door
then
i
no
longer
have
any
use
for
you
foldal
starting
up
no
use
borkman
since
you
do
not
believe
that
the
tide
will
turn
for
me
foldal
how
can
i
believe
in
the
teeth
of
all
reason
you
would
have
to
be
legally
rehabilitated
borkman
go
on
go
on
foldal
it
true
i
never
passed
my
examination
but
i
have
read
enough
law
to
know
that
borkman
quickly
it
is
impossible
you
mean
foldal
there
is
no
precedent
for
such
a
thing
borkman
exceptional
men
are
above
precedents
foldal
the
law
knows
nothing
of
such
distinctions
borkman
harshly
and
decisively
you
are
no
poet
vilhelm
foldal
unconsciously
folding
his
hands
do
you
say
that
in
sober
earnest
borkman
dismissing
the
subject
without
answering
we
are
only
wasting
each
other
time
you
had
better
not
come
here
again
foldal
then
you
really
want
me
to
leave
you
borkman
without
looking
at
him
i
have
no
longer
any
use
for
you
foldal
softly
taking
his
portfolio
no
no
no
i
daresay
not
borkman
here
you
have
been
lying
to
me
all
the
time
foldal
shaking
his
head
never
lying
john
gabriel
borkman
have
you
not
sat
here
feeding
me
with
hope
and
trust
and
confidence
that
was
all
a
lie
foldal
it
was
a
lie
so
long
as
you
believed
in
my
vocation
so
long
as
you
believed
in
me
i
believed
in
you
borkman
then
we
have
been
all
the
time
deceiving
each
other
and
perhaps
deceiving
ourselves
both
of
us
foldal
but
is
that
just
the
essence
of
friendship
john
gabriel
borkman
smiling
bitterly
yes
you
are
right
there
friendship
means
deception
i
have
learnt
that
once
before
foldal
looking
at
him
i
have
no
poetic
vocation
and
you
could
actually
say
it
to
me
so
bluntly
borkman
in
a
gentler
tone
well
you
know
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
these
matters
foldal
perhaps
you
know
more
than
you
think
borkman
i
foldal
softly
yes
you
for
i
myself
have
had
my
doubts
now
and
then
i
may
tell
you
the
horrible
doubt
that
i
may
have
bungled
my
life
for
the
sake
of
a
delusion
borkman
if
you
have
no
faith
in
yourself
you
are
on
the
downward
path
indeed
foldal
that
was
why
i
found
such
comfort
in
coming
here
to
lean
upon
your
faith
in
me
taking
his
hat
but
now
you
have
become
a
stranger
to
me
borkman
and
you
to
me
foldal
good
night
john
gabriel
borkman
good
night
vilhelm
foldal
goes
out
to
the
left
borkman
stands
for
a
moment
gazing
at
the
closed
door
makes
a
movement
as
though
to
call
foldal
back
but
changes
his
mind
and
begins
to
pace
the
floor
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
then
he
stops
at
the
table
beside
the
sofa
and
puts
out
the
lamp
the
room
becomes
half
dark
after
a
short
pause
there
comes
a
knock
at
the
tapestry
door
borkman
at
the
table
starts
turns
and
asks
in
a
loud
voice
who
is
that
knocking
no
answer
another
knock
borkman
without
moving
who
is
it
come
in
ella
rentheim
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
appears
in
the
doorway
she
wears
her
black
dress
as
before
with
her
cloak
thrown
loosely
round
her
shoulders
borkman
staring
at
her
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
ella
rentheim
closes
the
door
and
advances
it
is
i
borkman
she
puts
down
the
candle
on
the
piano
and
remains
standing
beside
it
borkman
stands
as
though
thunderstruck
stares
fixedly
at
her
and
says
in
a
is
it
is
it
ella
is
it
ella
rentheim
ella
rentheim
yes
it
your
ella
as
you
used
to
call
me
in
the
old
days
many
many
years
ago
borkman
as
before
yes
it
is
you
ella
i
can
see
you
now
ella
rentheim
can
you
recognise
me
borkman
yes
now
i
begin
to
ella
rentheim
the
years
have
told
on
me
and
brought
winter
with
them
borkman
do
you
not
think
so
borkman
in
a
forced
voice
you
are
a
good
deal
changed
just
at
first
glance
ella
rentheim
there
are
no
dark
curls
on
my
neck
now
the
curls
you
once
loved
to
twist
round
your
fingers
borkman
quickly
true
i
can
see
now
ella
you
have
done
your
hair
differently
ella
rentheim
with
a
sad
smile
precisely
it
is
the
way
i
do
my
hair
that
makes
the
difference
borkman
changing
the
subject
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
in
this
part
of
the
world
ella
rentheim
i
have
only
just
arrived
borkman
why
have
you
come
all
this
way
now
in
winter
ella
rentheim
that
you
shall
hear
borkman
is
it
me
you
have
come
to
see
ella
rentheim
you
among
others
but
if
i
am
to
tell
you
my
errand
i
must
begin
far
back
borkman
you
look
tired
ella
rentheim
yes
i
am
tired
borkman
wo
you
sit
down
there
on
the
sofa
ella
rentheim
yes
thank
you
i
need
rest
she
crosses
to
the
right
and
seats
herself
in
the
furthest
forward
corner
of
the
sofa
borkman
stands
beside
the
table
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
looking
at
her
a
short
silence
ella
rentheim
it
seems
an
endless
time
since
we
two
met
borkman
face
to
face
borkman
gloomily
it
is
a
long
long
time
and
terrible
things
have
passed
since
then
ella
rentheim
a
whole
lifetime
has
passed
a
wasted
lifetime
borkman
looking
keenly
at
her
wasted
ella
rentheim
yes
i
say
wasted
for
both
of
us
borkman
in
a
cold
business
tone
i
can
not
regard
my
life
as
wasted
yet
ella
rentheim
and
what
about
mine
borkman
there
you
have
yourself
to
blame
ella
ella
rentheim
with
a
start
and
you
can
say
that
borkman
you
could
quite
well
have
been
happy
without
me
ella
rentheim
do
you
believe
that
borkman
if
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
ella
rentheim
bitterly
oh
yes
i
know
well
enough
there
was
some
one
else
ready
to
marry
me
borkman
but
you
rejected
him
ella
rentheim
yes
i
did
borkman
time
after
time
you
rejected
him
year
after
year
ella
rentheim
scornfully
year
after
year
i
rejected
happiness
i
suppose
you
think
borkman
you
might
perfectly
well
have
been
happy
with
him
and
then
i
should
have
been
saved
ella
rentheim
you
borkman
yes
you
would
have
saved
me
ella
ella
rentheim
how
do
you
mean
borkman
he
thought
i
was
at
the
bottom
of
your
obstinacy
of
your
perpetual
refusals
and
then
he
took
his
revenge
it
was
so
easy
for
him
he
had
all
my
frank
confiding
letters
in
his
keeping
he
made
his
own
use
of
them
and
then
it
was
all
over
with
me
for
the
time
that
is
to
say
so
you
see
it
is
all
your
doing
ella
ella
rentheim
oh
indeed
borkman
if
we
look
into
the
matter
it
appears
that
it
is
i
who
owe
you
reparation
borkman
it
depends
how
you
look
at
it
i
know
quite
well
all
that
you
have
done
for
us
you
bought
in
this
house
and
the
whole
property
at
the
auction
you
placed
the
house
entirely
at
my
disposal
and
your
sister
too
you
took
charge
of
erhart
and
cared
for
him
in
every
way
ella
rentheim
as
long
as
i
was
allowed
to
borkman
by
your
sister
you
mean
i
have
never
mixed
myself
up
in
these
domestic
affairs
as
i
was
saying
i
know
all
the
sacrifices
you
have
made
for
me
and
for
your
sister
but
you
were
in
a
position
to
do
so
ella
and
you
must
not
forget
that
it
was
i
who
placed
you
in
that
position
ella
rentheim
indignantly
there
you
make
a
great
mistake
borkman
it
was
the
love
of
my
inmost
heart
for
erhart
and
for
you
too
that
made
me
do
it
borkman
interrupting
my
dear
ella
do
not
let
us
get
upon
questions
of
sentiment
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
mean
of
course
that
if
you
acted
generously
it
was
i
that
put
it
in
your
power
to
do
so
ella
rentheim
smiling
h
in
my
power
borkman
warmly
yes
put
it
in
your
power
i
say
on
the
eve
of
the
great
decisive
battle
when
i
could
not
afford
to
spare
either
kith
or
kin
when
i
had
to
grasp
at
when
i
did
grasp
at
the
millions
that
were
entrusted
to
me
then
i
spared
all
that
was
yours
every
farthing
although
i
could
have
taken
it
and
made
use
of
it
as
i
did
of
all
the
rest
ella
rentheim
coldly
and
quietly
that
is
quite
true
borkman
borkman
yes
it
is
and
that
was
why
when
they
came
and
took
me
they
found
all
your
securities
untouched
in
the
of
the
bank
ella
rentheim
looking
at
him
i
have
often
and
often
wondered
what
was
your
real
reason
for
sparing
all
my
property
that
and
that
alone
borkman
my
reason
ella
rentheim
yes
your
reason
tell
me
borkman
harshly
and
scornfully
perhaps
you
think
it
was
that
i
might
have
something
to
fall
back
upon
if
things
went
wrong
ella
rentheim
oh
no
i
am
sure
you
did
not
think
of
that
in
those
days
borkman
never
i
was
so
absolutely
certain
of
victory
ella
rentheim
well
then
why
was
it
that
borkman
shrugging
his
shoulders
upon
my
soul
ella
it
is
not
so
easy
to
remember
one
motives
of
twenty
years
ago
i
only
know
that
when
i
used
to
grapple
silently
and
alone
with
all
the
great
projects
i
had
in
my
mind
i
had
something
like
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
is
starting
on
a
balloon
voyage
all
through
my
sleepless
nights
i
was
inflating
my
giant
balloon
and
preparing
to
soar
away
into
perilous
unknown
regions
ella
rentheim
smiling
you
who
never
had
the
least
doubt
of
victory
borkman
impatiently
men
are
made
so
ella
they
both
doubt
and
believe
at
the
same
time
looking
straight
before
him
and
i
suppose
that
was
why
i
would
not
take
you
and
yours
with
me
in
the
balloon
ella
rentheim
eagerly
why
i
ask
you
tell
me
why
borkman
without
looking
at
her
one
shrinks
from
risking
what
one
holds
dearest
on
such
a
voyage
ella
rentheim
you
had
risked
what
was
dearest
to
you
on
that
voyage
your
whole
future
life
borkman
life
is
not
always
what
one
holds
dearest
ella
rentheim
breathlessly
was
that
how
you
felt
at
that
time
borkman
i
fancy
it
was
ella
rentheim
i
was
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
you
borkman
i
seem
to
remember
something
of
the
sort
ella
rentheim
and
yet
years
had
passed
since
you
had
deserted
me
and
married
married
another
borkman
deserted
you
you
say
you
must
know
very
well
that
it
was
higher
motives
well
then
other
motives
that
compelled
me
without
his
support
i
could
not
have
done
anything
ella
rentheim
controlling
herself
so
you
deserted
me
from
higher
motives
borkman
i
could
not
get
on
without
his
help
and
he
made
you
the
price
of
helping
me
ella
rentheim
and
you
paid
the
price
paid
it
in
full
without
haggling
borkman
i
had
no
choice
i
had
to
conquer
or
fall
ella
rentheim
in
a
trembling
voice
looking
at
him
can
what
you
tell
me
be
true
that
i
was
then
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
you
borkman
both
then
and
afterwards
long
long
after
ella
rentheim
but
you
bartered
me
away
none
the
less
drove
a
bargain
with
another
man
for
your
love
sold
my
love
for
a
for
a
directorship
borkman
gloomily
and
bowed
down
i
was
driven
by
inexorable
necessity
ella
ella
rentheim
rises
from
the
sofa
quivering
with
passion
criminal
borkman
starts
but
controls
himself
i
have
heard
that
word
before
ella
rentheim
oh
do
imagine
i
thinking
of
anything
you
may
have
done
against
the
law
of
the
land
the
use
you
made
of
all
those
vouchers
and
securities
or
whatever
you
call
them
do
you
think
i
care
a
straw
about
that
if
i
could
have
stood
at
your
side
when
the
crash
came
borkman
eagerly
what
then
ella
ella
rentheim
trust
me
i
should
have
borne
it
all
so
gladly
along
with
you
the
shame
the
ruin
i
would
have
helped
you
to
bear
it
all
all
borkman
would
you
have
had
the
will
the
strength
ella
rentheim
both
the
will
and
the
strength
for
then
i
did
not
know
of
your
great
your
terrible
crime
borkman
what
crime
what
are
you
speaking
of
ella
rentheim
i
am
speaking
of
that
crime
for
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
borkman
staring
at
her
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
ella
rentheim
approaching
him
you
are
a
murderer
you
have
committed
the
one
mortal
sin
borkman
falling
back
towards
the
piano
you
are
raving
ella
ella
rentheim
you
have
killed
the
in
me
still
nearer
him
do
you
understand
what
that
means
the
bible
speaks
of
a
mysterious
sin
for
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
i
have
never
understood
what
it
could
be
but
now
i
understand
the
great
unpardonable
sin
is
to
murder
the
in
a
human
soul
borkman
and
you
say
i
have
done
that
ella
rentheim
you
have
done
that
i
have
never
rightly
understood
until
this
evening
what
had
really
happened
to
me
that
you
deserted
me
and
turned
to
gunhild
instead
i
took
that
to
be
mere
common
fickleness
on
your
part
and
the
result
of
heartless
scheming
on
hers
i
almost
think
i
despised
you
a
little
in
spite
of
everything
but
now
i
see
it
you
deserted
the
woman
you
loved
me
me
me
what
you
held
dearest
in
the
world
you
were
ready
to
barter
away
for
gain
that
is
the
double
murder
you
have
committed
the
murder
of
your
own
soul
and
of
mine
borkman
with
cold
how
well
i
recognise
your
passionate
ungovernable
spirit
ella
no
doubt
it
is
natural
enough
that
you
should
look
at
the
thing
in
this
light
of
course
you
are
a
woman
and
therefore
it
would
seem
that
your
own
heart
is
the
one
thing
you
know
or
care
about
in
this
world
ella
rentheim
yes
yes
it
is
borkman
your
own
heart
is
the
only
thing
that
exists
for
you
ella
rentheim
the
only
thing
the
only
thing
you
are
right
there
borkman
but
you
must
remember
that
i
am
a
man
as
a
woman
you
were
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
to
me
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
one
woman
can
always
take
the
place
of
another
ella
rentheim
looks
at
him
with
a
smile
was
that
your
experience
when
you
had
made
gunhild
your
wife
borkman
no
but
the
great
aims
i
had
in
life
helped
me
to
bear
even
that
i
wanted
to
have
at
my
command
all
the
sources
of
power
in
this
country
all
the
wealth
that
lay
hidden
in
the
soil
and
the
rocks
and
the
forests
and
the
sea
i
wanted
to
gather
it
all
into
my
hands
to
make
myself
master
of
it
all
and
so
to
promote
the
of
many
many
thousands
ella
rentheim
lost
in
recollection
i
know
it
think
of
all
the
evenings
we
spent
in
talking
over
your
projects
borkman
yes
i
could
talk
to
you
ella
ella
rentheim
i
jested
with
your
plans
and
asked
whether
you
wanted
to
awaken
all
the
sleeping
spirits
of
the
mine
borkman
nodding
i
remember
that
phrase
slowly
all
the
sleeping
spirits
of
the
mine
ella
rentheim
but
you
did
not
take
it
as
a
jest
you
said
yes
yes
ella
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
do
borkman
and
so
it
was
if
only
i
could
get
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
that
depended
on
that
one
man
he
could
and
would
secure
me
the
control
of
the
bank
if
i
on
my
side
ella
rentheim
yes
just
so
if
you
on
your
side
would
renounce
the
woman
you
loved
and
who
loved
you
beyond
words
in
return
borkman
i
knew
his
consuming
passion
for
you
i
knew
that
on
no
other
condition
would
he
ella
rentheim
and
so
you
struck
the
bargain
borkman
vehemently
yes
i
did
ella
for
the
love
of
power
is
uncontrollable
in
me
you
see
so
i
struck
the
bargain
i
had
to
and
he
helped
me
up
towards
the
beckoning
heights
that
i
was
bent
on
reaching
and
i
mounted
and
mounted
year
by
year
i
mounted
ella
rentheim
and
i
was
as
though
wiped
out
of
your
life
borkman
and
after
all
he
hurled
me
into
the
abyss
again
on
account
of
you
ella
ella
rentheim
after
a
short
thoughtful
silence
borkman
does
it
not
seem
to
you
as
if
there
had
been
a
sort
of
curse
on
our
whole
relation
borkman
looking
at
her
a
curse
ella
rentheim
yes
do
you
think
so
borkman
uneasily
yes
but
why
is
it
with
an
outburst
oh
ella
i
begin
to
wonder
which
is
in
the
right
you
or
i
ella
rentheim
it
is
you
who
have
sinned
you
have
done
to
death
all
the
gladness
of
my
life
in
me
borkman
anxiously
do
not
say
that
ella
ella
rentheim
all
a
woman
gladness
at
any
rate
from
the
day
when
your
image
began
to
dwindle
in
my
mind
i
have
lived
my
life
as
though
under
an
eclipse
during
all
these
years
it
has
grown
harder
and
harder
for
me
and
at
last
utterly
impossible
to
love
any
living
creature
human
beings
animals
plants
i
shrank
from
all
from
all
but
one
borkman
what
one
ella
rentheim
erhart
of
course
borkman
erhart
ella
rentheim
erhart
your
son
borkman
borkman
has
he
really
been
so
close
to
your
heart
ella
rentheim
why
else
should
i
have
taken
him
to
me
and
kept
him
as
long
as
ever
i
could
why
borkman
i
thought
it
was
out
of
pity
like
all
the
rest
that
you
did
ella
rentheim
in
strong
inward
emotion
pity
ha
ha
i
have
never
known
pity
since
you
deserted
me
i
was
incapable
of
feeling
it
if
a
poor
starved
child
came
into
my
kitchen
shivering
and
crying
and
begging
for
a
morsel
of
food
i
let
the
servants
look
to
it
i
never
felt
any
desire
to
take
the
child
to
myself
to
warm
it
at
my
own
hearth
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
eat
and
be
satisfied
and
yet
i
was
not
like
that
when
i
was
young
that
i
remember
clearly
it
is
you
that
have
created
an
empty
barren
desert
within
me
and
without
me
too
borkman
except
only
for
erhart
ella
rentheim
yes
except
for
your
son
but
i
am
hardened
to
every
other
living
thing
you
have
cheated
me
of
a
mother
joy
and
happiness
in
life
and
of
a
mother
sorrows
and
tears
as
well
and
perhaps
that
is
the
heaviest
part
of
the
loss
to
me
borkman
do
you
say
that
ella
ella
rentheim
who
knows
it
may
be
that
a
mother
sorrows
and
tears
were
what
i
needed
most
with
still
deeper
emotion
but
at
that
time
i
could
not
resign
myself
to
my
loss
and
that
was
why
i
took
erhart
to
me
i
won
him
entirely
won
his
whole
warm
trustful
childish
heart
until
oh
borkman
until
what
ella
rentheim
until
his
mother
his
mother
in
the
flesh
i
mean
took
him
from
me
again
borkman
he
had
to
leave
you
in
any
case
he
had
to
come
to
town
ella
rentheim
wringing
her
hands
yes
but
i
can
not
bear
the
solitude
the
emptiness
i
can
not
bear
the
loss
of
your
son
heart
borkman
with
an
evil
expression
in
his
eyes
h
i
doubt
whether
you
have
lost
it
ella
hearts
are
not
so
easily
lost
to
a
certain
person
in
the
room
below
ella
rentheim
i
have
lost
erhart
here
and
she
has
won
him
back
again
or
if
not
she
some
one
else
that
is
plain
enough
in
the
letters
he
writes
me
from
time
to
time
borkman
then
it
is
to
take
him
back
with
you
that
you
have
come
here
ella
rentheim
yes
if
only
it
were
possible
borkman
it
is
possible
enough
if
you
have
set
your
heart
upon
it
for
you
have
the
first
and
strongest
claims
upon
him
ella
rentheim
oh
claims
claims
what
is
the
use
of
claims
if
he
is
not
mine
of
his
own
free
will
he
is
not
mine
at
all
and
have
him
i
must
i
must
have
my
boy
heart
whole
and
undivided
now
borkman
you
must
remember
that
erhart
is
well
into
his
twenties
you
could
scarcely
reckon
on
keeping
his
heart
very
long
undivided
as
you
express
it
ella
rentheim
with
a
melancholy
smile
it
would
not
need
to
be
for
so
very
long
borkman
indeed
i
should
have
thought
that
when
you
want
a
thing
you
want
it
to
the
end
of
your
days
ella
rentheim
so
i
do
but
that
need
not
mean
for
very
long
borkman
taken
aback
what
do
you
mean
by
that
ella
rentheim
i
suppose
you
know
i
have
been
in
bad
health
for
many
years
past
borkman
have
you
ella
rentheim
do
you
not
know
that
borkman
no
i
can
not
say
i
did
ella
rentheim
looking
at
him
in
surprise
has
erhart
not
told
you
so
borkman
i
really
do
remember
at
the
moment
ella
rentheim
perhaps
he
has
not
spoken
of
me
at
all
borkman
oh
yes
i
believe
he
has
spoken
of
you
but
the
fact
is
i
so
seldom
see
anything
of
him
scarcely
ever
there
is
a
certain
person
below
that
keeps
him
away
from
me
keeps
him
away
you
understand
ella
rentheim
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
borkman
borkman
yes
absolutely
sure
changing
his
tone
and
so
you
have
been
in
bad
health
ella
ella
rentheim
yes
i
have
and
this
autumn
i
grew
so
much
worse
that
i
had
to
come
to
town
and
take
better
medical
advice
borkman
and
you
have
seen
the
doctors
already
ella
rentheim
yes
this
morning
borkman
and
what
did
they
say
to
you
ella
rentheim
they
gave
me
full
assurance
of
what
i
had
long
suspected
borkman
well
ella
rentheim
calmly
and
quietly
my
illness
will
never
be
cured
borkman
borkman
oh
you
must
not
believe
that
ella
ella
rentheim
it
is
a
disease
that
there
is
no
help
or
cure
for
the
doctors
can
do
nothing
with
it
they
must
just
let
it
take
its
course
they
can
not
possibly
check
it
at
most
they
can
allay
the
suffering
and
that
is
always
something
borkman
oh
but
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
run
its
course
i
am
sure
it
will
ella
rentheim
i
may
perhaps
last
out
the
winter
they
told
me
borkman
without
thinking
oh
well
the
winter
is
long
ella
rentheim
quietly
long
enough
for
me
at
any
rate
borkman
eagerly
changing
the
subject
but
what
in
all
the
world
can
have
brought
on
this
illness
you
who
have
always
lived
such
a
healthy
and
regular
life
what
can
have
brought
it
on
ella
rentheim
looking
at
him
the
doctors
thought
that
perhaps
at
one
time
in
my
life
i
had
had
to
go
through
some
great
stress
of
emotion
borkman
firing
up
emotion
aha
i
understand
you
mean
that
it
is
my
fault
ella
rentheim
with
increasing
inward
agitation
it
is
too
late
to
go
into
that
matter
now
but
i
must
have
my
heart
own
child
again
before
i
go
it
is
so
unspeakably
sad
for
me
to
think
that
i
must
go
away
from
all
that
is
called
life
away
from
sun
and
light
and
air
and
not
leave
behind
me
one
single
human
being
who
will
think
of
me
who
will
remember
me
lovingly
and
mournfully
as
a
son
remembers
and
thinks
of
the
mother
he
has
lost
borkman
after
a
short
pause
take
him
ella
if
you
can
win
him
ella
rentheim
with
animation
do
you
give
your
consent
can
you
borkman
gloomily
yes
and
it
is
no
great
sacrifice
either
for
in
any
case
he
is
not
mine
ella
rentheim
thank
you
thank
you
all
the
same
for
the
sacrifice
but
i
have
one
thing
more
to
beg
of
you
a
great
thing
for
me
borkman
borkman
well
what
is
it
ella
rentheim
i
daresay
you
will
think
it
childish
of
me
you
will
not
understand
borkman
go
on
tell
me
what
it
is
ella
rentheim
when
i
die
as
i
must
soon
i
shall
have
a
fair
amount
to
leave
behind
me
borkman
yes
i
suppose
so
ella
rentheim
and
i
intend
to
leave
it
all
to
erhart
borkman
well
you
have
really
no
one
nearer
to
you
than
he
ella
rentheim
warmly
no
indeed
i
have
no
one
nearer
me
than
he
borkman
no
one
of
your
own
family
you
are
the
last
ella
rentheim
nodding
slowly
yes
that
is
just
it
when
i
die
the
name
of
rentheim
dies
with
me
and
that
is
such
a
torturing
thought
to
me
to
be
wiped
out
of
existence
even
to
your
very
name
borkman
firing
up
ah
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
ella
rentheim
passionately
do
not
let
this
be
my
forte
let
erhart
bear
my
name
after
me
borkman
i
understand
you
well
enough
you
want
to
save
my
son
from
having
to
bear
his
father
name
that
is
your
meaning
ella
rentheim
no
no
not
that
i
myself
would
have
borne
it
proudly
and
gladly
along
with
you
but
a
mother
who
is
at
the
point
of
death
there
is
more
binding
force
in
a
name
than
you
think
or
believe
borkman
borkman
coldly
and
proudly
well
and
good
ella
i
am
man
enough
to
bear
my
own
name
alone
ella
rentheim
seizing
and
pressing
his
hand
thank
you
thank
you
now
there
has
been
a
full
settlement
between
us
yes
yes
let
it
be
so
you
have
made
all
the
atonement
in
your
power
for
when
i
have
gone
from
the
world
i
shall
leave
erhart
rentheim
behind
me
the
tapestry
door
is
thrown
open
borkman
with
the
large
shawl
over
her
head
stands
in
the
doorway
borkman
in
violent
agitation
never
to
his
dying
day
shall
erhart
be
called
by
that
name
ella
rentheim
shrinking
back
gunhild
borkman
harshly
and
threateningly
i
allow
no
one
to
come
up
to
my
room
borkman
advancing
a
step
i
do
not
ask
your
permission
borkman
going
towards
her
what
do
you
want
with
me
borkman
i
will
fight
with
all
my
might
for
you
i
will
protect
you
from
the
powers
of
evil
ella
rentheim
the
worst
powers
of
evil
are
in
yourself
gunhild
borkman
harshly
so
be
it
then
menacingly
with
upstretched
arm
but
this
i
tell
you
he
shall
bear
his
father
name
and
bear
it
aloft
in
honour
again
my
son
heart
shall
be
mine
mine
and
no
other
she
goes
out
by
the
tapestry
door
and
shuts
it
behind
her
ella
rentheim
shaken
and
shattered
borkman
erhart
life
will
be
wrecked
in
this
storm
there
must
be
an
understanding
between
you
and
gunhild
we
must
go
down
to
her
at
once
borkman
looking
at
her
we
i
too
do
you
mean
ella
rentheim
both
you
and
borkman
shaking
his
head
she
is
hard
i
tell
you
hard
as
the
metal
i
once
dreamed
of
hewing
out
of
the
rocks
ella
rentheim
then
try
it
now
borkman
does
not
answer
but
stands
looking
doubtfully
at
her
act
third
borkman
drawing
room
the
lamp
is
still
burning
on
the
table
beside
the
sofa
in
front
the
at
the
back
is
quite
dark
borkman
with
the
shawl
still
over
her
head
enters
in
violent
agitation
by
the
hall
door
goes
up
to
the
window
draws
the
curtain
a
little
aside
and
looks
out
then
she
seats
herself
beside
the
stove
but
immediately
springs
up
again
goes
to
the
and
rings
stands
beside
the
sofa
and
waits
a
moment
no
one
comes
then
she
rings
again
this
time
more
violently
the
maid
presently
enters
from
the
hall
she
looks
sleepy
and
out
of
temper
and
appears
to
have
dressed
in
great
haste
borkman
impatiently
what
has
become
of
you
malena
i
have
rung
for
you
twice
the
maid
yes
i
heard
you
borkman
and
yet
you
did
come
the
maid
sulkily
i
had
to
put
some
clothes
on
first
i
suppose
borkman
yes
you
must
dress
yourself
properly
and
then
you
must
run
and
fetch
my
son
the
maid
looking
at
her
in
astonishment
you
want
me
to
fetch
erhart
borkman
yes
tell
him
he
must
come
home
to
me
at
once
i
want
to
speak
to
him
the
maid
grumbling
then
i
better
go
to
the
bailiff
and
call
up
the
coachman
borkman
why
the
maid
to
get
him
to
harness
the
sledge
the
snow
dreadful
borkman
oh
that
does
matter
only
make
haste
and
go
it
just
round
the
corner
the
maid
why
you
ca
call
that
just
round
the
corner
borkman
of
course
it
is
do
you
know
hinkel
villa
the
maid
with
malice
oh
indeed
it
there
erhart
is
this
evening
borkman
taken
aback
why
where
else
should
he
be
the
maid
with
a
slight
smile
well
i
only
thought
he
might
be
where
he
usually
is
borkman
where
do
you
mean
the
maid
at
wilton
as
they
call
her
borkman
wilton
my
son
is
so
often
there
the
maid
half
muttering
i
heard
say
as
he
there
every
day
of
his
life
borkman
that
all
nonsense
malena
go
straight
to
hinkel
and
try
to
to
get
hold
of
him
the
maid
with
a
toss
of
her
head
oh
very
well
i
going
she
is
on
the
point
of
going
out
by
the
hall
but
just
at
that
moment
the
hall
door
is
opened
and
ella
rentheim
and
borkman
appear
on
the
threshold
borkman
staggers
a
step
backwards
what
does
this
mean
the
maid
terrified
instinctively
folding
her
hands
lord
save
us
borkman
whispers
to
the
maid
tell
him
he
must
come
this
instant
the
maid
softly
yes
ella
rentheim
and
after
her
borkman
enter
the
room
the
maid
sidles
behind
them
to
the
door
goes
out
and
closes
it
after
her
borkman
having
recovered
her
turns
to
ella
what
does
he
want
down
here
in
my
room
ella
rentheim
he
wants
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
you
gunhild
borkman
he
has
never
tried
that
before
ella
rentheim
he
is
going
to
this
evening
borkman
the
last
time
we
stood
face
to
face
it
was
in
the
court
when
i
was
summoned
to
give
an
account
borkman
approaching
and
this
evening
it
is
who
will
give
an
account
of
myself
borkman
looking
at
him
you
borkman
not
of
what
i
have
done
amiss
all
the
world
knows
that
borkman
with
a
bitter
sigh
yes
that
is
true
all
the
world
knows
that
borkman
but
it
does
not
know
why
i
did
it
why
i
had
to
do
it
people
do
not
understand
that
i
had
to
because
i
was
myself
because
i
was
john
gabriel
borkman
myself
and
not
another
and
that
is
what
i
will
try
to
explain
to
you
borkman
shaking
her
head
it
is
of
no
use
temptations
and
promptings
acquit
no
one
borkman
they
may
acquit
one
in
one
own
eyes
borkman
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
oh
let
all
that
alone
i
have
thought
over
that
black
business
of
yours
enough
and
to
spare
borkman
i
too
during
those
five
endless
years
in
my
cell
and
elsewhere
i
had
time
to
think
it
over
and
during
the
eight
years
up
there
in
the
gallery
i
have
had
still
more
ample
time
i
have
the
whole
case
by
myself
time
after
time
i
have
it
i
have
been
my
own
accuser
my
own
defender
and
my
own
judge
i
have
been
more
impartial
than
any
one
else
could
be
that
i
venture
to
say
i
have
paced
up
and
down
the
gallery
there
turning
every
one
of
my
actions
upside
down
and
inside
out
i
have
examined
them
from
all
sides
as
unsparingly
as
pitilessly
as
any
lawyer
of
them
all
and
the
final
judgment
i
have
always
come
to
is
this
the
one
person
i
have
sinned
against
is
myself
borkman
and
what
about
me
what
about
your
son
borkman
you
and
he
are
included
in
what
i
mean
when
i
say
myself
borkman
and
what
about
the
hundreds
of
others
then
the
people
you
are
said
to
have
ruined
borkman
more
vehemently
i
had
power
in
my
hands
and
then
i
felt
the
irresistible
vocation
within
me
the
prisoned
millions
lay
all
over
the
country
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
calling
aloud
to
me
they
shrieked
to
me
to
free
them
but
no
one
else
heard
their
cry
i
alone
had
ears
for
it
borkman
yes
to
the
branding
of
the
name
of
borkman
borkman
if
the
others
had
had
the
power
do
you
think
they
would
not
have
acted
exactly
as
i
did
borkman
no
one
no
one
but
you
would
have
done
it
borkman
perhaps
not
but
that
would
have
been
because
they
had
not
my
brains
and
if
they
had
done
it
it
would
not
have
been
with
my
aims
in
view
the
act
would
have
been
a
different
act
in
short
i
have
acquitted
myself
ella
rentheim
softly
and
appealingly
oh
can
you
say
that
so
confidently
borkman
borkman
nodding
acquitted
myself
on
that
score
but
then
comes
the
great
crushing
borkman
what
is
that
borkman
i
have
skulked
up
there
and
wasted
eight
precious
years
of
my
life
the
very
day
i
was
set
free
i
should
have
gone
forth
into
the
world
out
into
the
dreamless
world
of
reality
i
should
have
begun
at
the
bottom
and
swung
myself
up
to
the
heights
anew
higher
than
ever
before
in
spite
of
all
that
lay
between
borkman
oh
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
over
again
take
my
word
for
that
borkman
shakes
his
head
and
looks
at
her
with
a
sententious
air
it
is
true
that
nothing
new
happens
but
what
has
happened
does
not
repeat
itself
either
it
is
the
eye
that
transforms
the
action
the
eye
born
anew
transforms
the
old
action
breaking
off
but
you
do
not
understand
this
borkman
curtly
no
i
do
not
understand
it
borkman
ah
that
is
just
the
curse
i
have
never
found
one
single
soul
to
understand
me
ella
rentheim
looking
at
him
never
borkman
borkman
except
one
perhaps
long
long
ago
in
the
days
when
i
did
not
think
i
needed
understanding
since
then
at
any
rate
no
one
has
understood
me
there
has
been
no
one
alive
enough
to
my
needs
to
be
afoot
and
rouse
me
to
ring
the
morning
bell
for
me
to
call
me
up
to
manful
work
anew
and
to
impress
upon
me
that
i
had
done
nothing
inexpiable
borkman
with
a
scornful
laugh
so
after
all
you
require
to
have
that
impressed
on
you
from
without
borkman
with
increasing
indignation
yes
when
the
whole
world
hisses
in
chorus
that
i
have
sunk
never
to
rise
again
there
come
moments
when
i
almost
believe
it
myself
raising
his
head
but
then
my
inmost
assurance
rises
again
triumphant
and
that
acquits
me
borkman
looking
harshly
at
him
why
have
you
never
come
and
asked
me
for
what
you
call
understanding
borkman
what
use
would
it
have
been
to
come
to
you
borkman
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
you
have
never
loved
anything
outside
yourself
that
is
the
secret
of
the
whole
matter
borkman
proudly
i
have
loved
power
borkman
yes
power
borkman
the
power
to
create
human
happiness
in
wide
wide
circles
around
me
borkman
you
had
once
the
power
to
make
me
happy
have
you
used
it
to
that
end
borkman
without
looking
at
her
some
one
must
generally
go
down
in
a
shipwreck
borkman
and
your
own
son
have
you
used
your
power
have
you
lived
and
laboured
to
make
him
happy
borkman
i
do
not
know
him
borkman
no
that
is
true
you
do
not
even
know
him
borkman
harshly
you
his
mother
have
taken
care
of
that
borkman
looking
at
him
with
a
lofty
air
oh
you
do
not
know
what
i
have
taken
care
of
borkman
you
borkman
yes
i
alone
borkman
then
tell
me
borkman
i
have
taken
care
of
your
memory
borkman
with
a
short
dry
laugh
my
memory
oh
indeed
it
sounds
almost
as
if
i
were
dead
already
borkman
with
emphasis
and
so
you
are
borkman
slowly
yes
perhaps
you
are
right
firing
up
but
no
no
not
yet
i
have
been
close
to
the
verge
of
death
but
now
i
have
awakened
i
have
come
to
myself
a
whole
life
lies
before
me
yet
i
can
see
it
awaiting
me
radiant
and
quickening
and
you
you
shall
see
it
too
borkman
raising
her
hand
never
dream
of
life
again
lie
quiet
where
you
are
ella
rentheim
shocked
gunhild
gunhild
how
can
you
borkman
not
listening
to
her
i
will
raise
the
monument
over
your
grave
borkman
the
pillar
of
shame
i
suppose
you
mean
borkman
with
increasing
excitement
oh
no
it
shall
be
no
pillar
of
metal
or
stone
and
no
one
shall
be
suffered
to
carve
any
scornful
legend
on
the
monument
i
shall
raise
there
shall
be
as
it
were
a
quickset
hedge
of
trees
and
bushes
close
close
around
your
tomb
they
shall
hide
away
all
the
darkness
that
has
been
the
eyes
of
men
and
the
thoughts
of
men
shall
no
longer
dwell
on
john
gabriel
borkman
borkman
hoarsely
and
cuttingly
and
this
labour
of
love
you
will
perform
borkman
not
by
my
own
strength
i
can
not
think
of
that
but
i
have
brought
up
one
to
help
me
who
shall
live
for
this
alone
his
life
shall
be
so
pure
and
high
and
bright
that
your
burrowing
in
the
dark
shall
be
as
though
it
had
never
been
borkman
darkly
and
threateningly
if
it
is
erhart
you
mean
say
so
at
once
borkman
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
yes
it
is
erhart
my
son
he
whom
you
are
ready
to
renounce
in
atonement
for
your
own
acts
borkman
with
a
look
towards
ella
in
atonement
for
my
blackest
sin
borkman
repelling
the
idea
a
sin
towards
a
stranger
only
remember
the
sin
towards
me
looking
triumphantly
at
them
both
but
he
will
not
obey
you
when
i
cry
out
to
him
in
my
need
he
will
come
to
me
it
is
with
me
that
he
will
remain
with
me
and
never
with
any
one
else
suddenly
listens
and
cries
i
hear
him
he
is
here
he
is
here
erhart
erhart
borkman
hastily
tears
open
the
hall
door
and
enters
the
room
he
is
wearing
an
overcoat
and
has
his
hat
on
erhart
pale
and
anxious
mother
what
in
heaven
name
seeing
borkman
who
is
standing
beside
the
doorway
leading
into
the
he
starts
and
takes
off
his
hat
after
a
silence
he
asks
what
do
you
want
with
me
mother
what
has
happened
borkman
stretching
her
arms
towards
him
i
want
to
see
you
erhart
i
want
to
have
you
with
me
always
erhart
stammering
have
me
always
what
do
you
mean
by
that
borkman
i
will
have
you
i
say
there
is
some
one
who
wants
to
take
you
away
from
me
erhart
recoiling
a
step
ah
so
you
know
borkman
yes
do
you
know
it
too
erhart
surprised
looking
at
her
do
know
it
yes
of
course
borkman
aha
so
you
have
planned
it
all
out
behind
my
back
erhart
erhart
erhart
quickly
mother
tell
me
what
it
is
you
know
borkman
i
know
everything
i
know
that
your
aunt
has
come
here
to
take
you
from
me
erhart
aunt
ella
ella
rentheim
oh
listen
to
me
a
moment
erhart
borkman
continuing
she
wants
me
to
give
you
up
to
her
she
wants
to
stand
in
your
mother
place
to
you
erhart
she
wants
you
to
be
her
son
and
not
mine
from
this
time
forward
she
wants
you
to
inherit
everything
from
her
to
renounce
your
own
name
and
take
hers
instead
erhart
aunt
ella
is
this
true
ella
rentheim
yes
it
is
true
erhart
i
knew
nothing
of
this
why
do
you
want
to
have
me
with
you
again
ella
rentheim
because
i
feel
that
i
am
losing
you
here
borkman
hardly
you
are
losing
him
to
me
yes
and
that
is
just
as
it
should
be
ella
rentheim
looking
beseechingly
at
him
erhart
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
you
for
i
must
tell
you
i
am
a
lonely
dying
woman
erhart
dying
ella
rentheim
yes
dying
will
you
came
and
be
with
me
to
the
end
attach
yourself
wholly
to
me
be
to
me
as
though
you
were
my
own
child
borkman
interrupting
and
forsake
your
mother
and
perhaps
your
mission
in
life
as
well
will
you
erhart
ella
rentheim
i
am
condemned
to
death
answer
me
erhart
erhart
warmly
with
emotion
aunt
ella
you
have
been
unspeakably
good
to
me
with
you
i
grew
up
in
as
perfect
happiness
as
any
boy
can
ever
have
known
borkman
erhart
erhart
ella
rentheim
oh
how
glad
i
am
that
you
can
still
say
that
erhart
but
i
can
not
sacrifice
myself
to
you
now
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
devote
myself
wholly
to
taking
a
son
place
towards
you
borkman
triumphing
ah
i
knew
it
you
shall
not
have
him
you
shall
not
have
him
ella
ella
rentheim
sadly
i
see
it
you
have
won
him
back
borkman
yes
yes
mine
he
is
and
mine
he
shall
remain
erhart
say
it
is
so
dear
we
two
have
still
a
long
way
to
go
together
have
we
not
erhart
struggling
with
himself
mother
i
may
as
well
tell
you
plainly
borkman
eagerly
what
erhart
i
am
afraid
it
is
only
a
very
little
way
you
and
i
can
go
together
borkman
stands
as
though
thunderstruck
what
do
you
mean
by
that
erhart
plucking
up
spirit
good
heavens
mother
i
am
young
after
all
i
feel
as
if
the
close
air
of
this
room
must
stifle
me
in
the
end
borkman
close
air
here
with
me
erhart
yes
here
with
you
mother
ella
rentheim
then
come
with
me
erhart
erhart
oh
aunt
ella
it
not
a
whit
better
with
you
it
different
but
no
better
no
better
for
me
it
smells
of
and
lavender
there
too
it
is
as
airless
there
as
here
borkman
shaken
but
having
recovered
her
composure
with
an
effort
airless
in
your
mother
room
you
say
erhart
in
growing
impatience
yes
i
do
know
how
else
to
express
it
all
this
morbid
watchfulness
and
and
idolisation
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
i
ca
endure
it
any
longer
borkman
looking
at
him
with
deep
solemnity
have
you
forgotten
what
you
have
consecrated
your
life
to
erhart
erhart
with
an
outburst
oh
say
rather
what
you
have
consecrated
my
life
to
you
you
have
been
my
will
you
have
never
given
me
leave
to
have
any
of
my
own
but
now
i
can
not
bear
this
yoke
any
longer
i
am
young
remember
that
mother
with
a
polite
considerate
glance
towards
borkman
i
can
not
consecrate
my
life
to
making
atonement
for
another
whoever
that
other
may
be
borkman
seized
with
growing
anxiety
who
is
it
that
has
transformed
you
erhart
erhart
struck
who
can
you
not
conceive
that
it
is
i
myself
borkman
no
no
no
you
have
come
under
some
strange
power
you
are
not
in
your
mother
power
any
longer
nor
in
your
your
either
erhart
with
laboured
defiance
i
am
in
my
own
power
mother
and
working
my
own
will
borkman
advancing
towards
erhart
then
perhaps
my
hour
has
come
at
last
erhart
distantly
and
with
measured
politeness
how
so
how
do
you
mean
sir
borkman
scornfully
yes
you
may
well
ask
that
borkman
continuing
undisturbed
listen
erhart
will
you
not
cast
in
your
lot
with
your
father
it
is
not
through
any
other
man
life
that
a
man
who
has
fallen
can
be
raised
up
again
these
are
only
empty
fables
that
have
been
told
to
you
down
here
in
the
airless
room
if
you
were
to
set
yourself
to
live
your
life
like
all
the
saints
together
it
would
be
of
no
use
whatever
to
me
erhart
with
measured
respectfulness
that
is
very
true
indeed
borkman
yes
it
is
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
either
if
i
should
resign
myself
to
wither
away
in
abject
penitence
i
have
tried
to
feed
myself
upon
hopes
and
dreams
all
through
these
years
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
be
content
with
that
and
now
i
mean
to
have
done
with
dreaming
erhart
with
a
slight
bow
and
what
will
what
will
you
do
sir
borkman
i
will
work
out
my
own
redemption
that
is
what
i
will
do
i
will
begin
at
the
bottom
again
it
is
only
through
his
present
and
his
future
that
a
man
can
atone
for
his
past
through
work
indefatigable
work
for
all
that
in
my
youth
seemed
to
give
life
its
meaning
and
that
now
seems
a
thousand
times
greater
than
it
did
then
erhart
will
you
join
with
me
and
help
me
in
this
new
life
borkman
raising
her
hand
warningly
do
not
do
it
erhart
ella
rentheim
warmly
yes
yes
do
it
oh
help
him
erhart
borkman
and
you
advise
him
to
do
that
you
the
lonely
dying
woman
ella
rentheim
i
do
care
about
myself
borkman
no
so
long
as
it
is
not
i
that
take
him
from
you
ella
rentheim
precisely
so
gunhild
borkman
will
you
erhart
erhart
wrung
with
pain
father
i
can
not
now
it
is
utterly
impossible
borkman
what
do
you
want
to
do
then
erhart
with
a
sudden
glow
i
am
young
i
want
to
live
for
once
in
a
way
as
well
as
other
people
i
want
to
live
my
own
life
ella
rentheim
you
can
not
give
up
two
or
three
little
months
to
brighten
the
close
of
a
poor
waning
life
erhart
i
can
not
aunt
however
much
i
may
wish
to
ella
rentheim
not
for
the
sake
of
one
who
loves
you
so
dearly
borkman
looking
sharply
at
him
and
your
mother
has
no
power
over
you
either
any
more
erhart
i
will
always
love
you
mother
but
i
can
not
go
on
living
for
you
alone
this
is
no
life
for
me
borkman
then
come
and
join
with
me
after
all
for
life
life
means
work
erhart
come
we
two
will
go
forth
into
life
and
work
together
erhart
passionately
yes
but
i
do
want
to
work
now
for
i
am
young
that
what
i
never
realised
before
but
now
the
knowledge
is
tingling
through
every
vein
in
my
body
i
will
not
work
i
will
only
live
live
live
borkman
with
a
cry
of
divination
erhart
what
will
you
live
for
erhart
with
sparkling
eyes
for
happiness
mother
borkman
and
where
do
you
think
you
can
find
that
erhart
i
have
found
it
already
borkman
shrieks
erhart
erhart
goes
quickly
to
the
hall
door
and
throws
it
open
erhart
calls
out
fanny
you
can
come
in
now
wilton
in
outdoor
wraps
appears
on
the
threshold
borkman
with
uplifted
hands
wilton
wilton
hesitating
a
little
with
an
enquiring
glance
at
erhart
do
you
want
me
to
erhart
yes
now
you
can
come
in
i
have
told
them
everything
wilton
comes
forward
into
the
room
erhart
closes
the
door
behind
her
she
bows
formally
to
borkman
who
returns
her
bow
in
silence
a
short
pause
wilton
in
a
subdued
but
firm
voice
so
the
word
has
been
spoken
and
i
suppose
you
all
think
i
have
brought
a
great
calamity
upon
this
house
borkman
slowly
looking
hard
at
her
you
have
crushed
the
last
remnant
of
interest
in
life
for
me
with
an
outburst
but
all
of
this
all
this
is
utterly
impossible
wilton
i
can
quite
understand
that
it
must
appear
impossible
to
you
borkman
borkman
yes
you
can
surely
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
impossible
or
what
wilton
i
should
rather
say
that
it
seems
highly
improbable
but
so
none
the
less
borkman
turning
are
you
really
in
earnest
about
this
erhart
erhart
this
means
happiness
for
me
mother
all
the
beauty
and
happiness
of
life
that
is
all
i
can
say
to
you
borkman
clenching
her
hands
together
to
mrs
wilton
oh
how
you
have
cajoled
and
deluded
my
unhappy
son
wilton
raising
her
head
proudly
i
have
done
nothing
of
the
sort
borkman
you
have
not
say
you
wilton
no
i
have
neither
cajoled
nor
deluded
him
erhart
came
to
me
of
his
own
free
will
and
of
my
own
free
will
i
went
out
to
meet
him
borkman
measuring
her
scornfully
with
her
eye
yes
indeed
that
i
can
easily
believe
wilton
with
borkman
there
are
forces
in
human
life
that
you
seem
to
know
very
little
about
borkman
what
forces
may
i
ask
wilton
the
forces
which
ordain
that
two
people
shall
join
their
lives
together
indissolubly
and
fearlessly
borkman
with
a
smile
i
thought
you
were
already
indissolubly
bound
to
another
wilton
shortly
that
other
has
deserted
me
borkman
but
he
is
still
living
they
say
wilton
he
is
dead
to
me
erhart
insistently
yes
mother
he
is
dead
to
fanny
and
besides
this
other
makes
no
difference
to
me
borkman
looking
sternly
at
him
so
you
know
all
this
about
the
other
erhart
yes
mother
i
know
quite
well
all
about
it
borkman
and
yet
you
can
say
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
erhart
with
defiant
petulance
i
can
only
tell
you
that
it
is
happiness
i
must
have
i
am
young
i
want
to
live
live
live
borkman
yes
you
are
young
erhart
too
young
for
this
wilton
firmly
and
earnestly
you
must
not
think
borkman
that
i
have
said
the
same
to
him
i
have
laid
my
whole
life
before
him
again
and
again
i
have
reminded
him
that
i
am
seven
years
older
than
he
erhart
interrupting
oh
nonsense
fanny
i
knew
that
all
the
time
wilton
but
nothing
nothing
was
of
any
use
borkman
indeed
nothing
then
why
did
you
not
dismiss
him
without
more
ado
close
your
door
to
him
you
should
have
done
that
and
done
it
in
time
wilton
looks
at
her
and
says
in
a
low
voice
i
could
not
do
that
borkman
borkman
why
could
you
not
wilton
because
for
me
too
this
meant
happiness
borkman
scornfully
h
happiness
happiness
wilton
i
have
never
before
known
happiness
in
life
and
i
can
not
possibly
drive
happiness
away
from
me
merely
because
it
comes
so
late
borkman
and
how
long
do
you
think
this
happiness
will
last
erhart
interrupting
whether
it
lasts
or
does
not
last
mother
it
does
matter
now
borkman
in
anger
blind
boy
that
you
are
do
you
not
see
where
all
this
is
leading
you
erhart
i
do
want
to
look
into
the
future
i
do
want
to
look
around
me
in
any
direction
i
am
only
determined
to
live
my
own
life
at
last
borkman
with
deep
pain
and
you
call
this
life
erhart
erhart
do
you
see
how
lovely
she
is
borkman
wringing
her
hands
and
i
have
to
bear
this
load
of
shame
as
well
borkman
at
the
back
harshly
and
cuttingly
ho
you
are
used
to
bearing
things
of
that
sort
gunhild
ella
rentheim
imploringly
borkman
erhart
similarly
father
borkman
day
after
day
i
shall
have
to
see
my
own
son
linked
to
a
a
erhart
interrupting
her
harshly
you
shall
see
nothing
of
the
kind
mother

doubt
wilton

had
living
with

so
you
are
taking
her
with
you
wilton
yes
i
ca
well
send
her
out
into
the
world
alone
borkman
suppressing
a
smile
what
do
you
say
to
this
erhart
erhart
with
some
embarrassment
shrugging
his
shoulders
well
mother
since
fanny
will
have
it
so
borkman
coldly
and
when
does
this
distinguished
party
set
out
if
one
may
ask
wilton
we
are
going
at
once
my
covered
sledge
is
waiting
on
the
road
outside
the
hinkels
borkman
looking
her
from
head
to
foot
aha
so
that
was
what
the
party
meant
wilton
smiling
yes
erhart
and
i
were
the
whole
party
and
little
frida
of
course
borkman
and
where
is
she
now
wilton
she
is
sitting
in
the
sledge
waiting
for
us
erhart
in
painful
embarrassment
mother
surely
you
can
understand
i
would
have
spared
you
all
this
you
and
every
one
borkman
looks
at
him
deeply
pained
you
would
have
gone
away
from
me
without
saying
a
erhart
yes
i
thought
that
would
be
best
best
for
all
of
us
our
boxes
were
packed
and
everything
settled
but
of
course
when
you
sent
for
me
i
holding
out
his
hands
to
her
mother
borkman
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
do
touch
me
erhart
gently
is
that
your
last
word
borkman
sternly
yes
erhart
turning
to
you
then
aunt
ella
ella
rentheim
pressing
his
hands
erhart
and
live
your
life
and
be
as
happy
as
happy
as
ever
you
can
erhart
thanks
aunt
bowing
to
borkman
father
whispers
to
mrs
wilton
let
us
get
away
the
sooner
the
better
wilton
in
a
low
voice
yes
let
us
borkman
with
a
malignant
smile
wilton
do
you
think
you
are
acting
quite
wisely
in
taking
that
girl
with
you
wilton
returning
the
smile
half
ironically
half
seriously
men
are
so
unstable
borkman
and
women
too
when
erhart
is
done
with
me
and
i
with
him
then
it
will
be
well
for
us
both
that
he
poor
fellow
should
have
some
one
to
fall
back
upon
borkman
but
you
yourself
wilton
oh
i
shall
know
what
to
do
i
assure
you
to
you
all
she
bows
and
goes
out
by
the
hall
door
erhart
stands
for
a
moment
as
though
wavering
then
he
turns
and
follows
her
borkman
dropping
her
folded
hands
childless
borkman
as
though
awakening
to
a
resolution
then
out
into
the
storm
alone
my
hat
my
cloak
he
goes
hastily
towards
the
door
ella
rentheim
in
terror
stopping
him
john
gabriel
where
are
you
going
borkman
out
into
the
storm
of
life
i
tell
you
let
me
go
ella
ella
rentheim
holding
him
back
no
no
i
wo
let
you
out
you
are
ill
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
borkman
let
me
go
i
tell
you
he
tears
himself
away
from
her
and
goes
out
by
the
hall
ella
rentheim
in
the
doorway
help
me
to
hold
him
gunhild
borkman
coldly
and
sharply
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
will
not
try
to
hold
any
one
in
all
the
world
let
them
go
away
from
me
both
the
one
and
the
other
as
far
as
far
as
ever
they
please
suddenly
with
a
piercing
shriek
erhart
do
leave
me
she
rushes
with
outstretched
arms
towards
the
door
ella
rentheim
stops
her
act
fourth
an
open
space
outside
the
main
building
which
lies
to
the
right
a
projecting
corner
of
it
is
visible
with
a
door
approached
by
a
flight
of
low
stone
steps
the
background
consists
of
steep
slopes
quite
close
at
hand
on
the
left
are
small
scattered
trees
forming
the
margin
of
a
wood
the
snowstorm
has
ceased
but
the
newly
fallen
snow
lies
deep
around
the
droop
under
heavy
loads
of
snow
the
night
is
dark
with
drifting
clouds
now
and
then
the
moon
gleams
out
faintly
only
a
dim
light
is
reflected
from
the
snow
borkman
borkman
and
ella
rentheim
are
standing
upon
the
steps
borkman
leaning
wearily
against
the
wall
of
the
house
he
has
an
cape
thrown
over
his
shoulders
holds
a
soft
grey
felt
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
thick
knotted
stick
in
the
other
ella
rentheim
carries
her
cloak
over
her
arm
borkman
great
shawl
has
slipped
down
over
her
shoulders
so
that
her
hair
is
uncovered
ella
rentheim
barring
the
way
for
mrs
borkman
do
go
after
him
gunhild
borkman
in
fear
and
agitation
let
me
pass
i
say
he
must
not
go
away
from
me
ella
rentheim
it
is
utterly
useless
i
tell
you
you
will
never
overtake
him
borkman
let
me
go
ella
i
will
cry
aloud
after
him
all
down
the
road
and
he
must
hear
his
mother
cry
ella
rentheim
he
can
not
hear
you
you
may
be
sure
he
is
in
the
sledge
already
borkman
no
no
he
ca
be
in
the
sledge
yet
ella
rentheim
the
doors
are
closed
upon
him
long
ago
believe
me
borkman
in
despair
if
he
is
in
the
sledge
then
he
is
there
with
her
with
her
her
borkman
laughing
gloomily
then
he
probably
wo
hear
his
cry
borkman
no
he
will
not
hear
it
listening
hark
what
is
that
ella
rentheim
also
listening
it
sounds
like
borkman
with
a
suppressed
scream
it
is
her
sledge
ella
rentheim
perhaps
it
another
borkman
no
no
it
is
wilton
covered
sledge
i
know
the
silver
bells
hark
now
they
are
driving
right
past
here
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
ella
rentheim
quickly
gunhild
if
you
want
to
cry
out
to
him
now
is
the
time
perhaps
after
all
the
tinkle
of
the
bells
sounds
close
at
hand
in
the
wood
make
haste
gunhild
now
they
are
right
under
us
borkman
stands
for
a
moment
undecided
then
she
stiffens
and
says
sternly
and
coldly
no
i
will
not
cry
out
to
him
let
erhart
borkman
pass
away
from
me
far
far
away
to
what
he
calls
life
and
happiness
the
sound
dies
away
in
the
distance
ella
rentheim
after
a
moment
now
the
bells
are
out
of
hearing
borkman
they
sounded
like
funeral
bells
borkman
with
a
dry
suppressed
laugh
oho
it
is
not
for
me
they
are
ringing
borkman
no
but
for
me
and
for
him
who
has
gone
from
me
ella
rentheim
nodding
thoughtfully
who
knows
if
after
all
they
may
not
be
ringing
in
life
and
happiness
for
him
gunhild
borkman
with
sudden
animation
looking
hard
at
her
life
and
happiness
you
say
ella
rentheim
for
a
little
while
at
any
rate
borkman
could
you
endure
to
let
him
know
life
and
happiness
with
her
ella
rentheim
with
warmth
and
feeling
indeed
i
could
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
borkman
coldly
then
you
must
be
richer
than
i
am
in
the
power
of
love
ella
rentheim
looking
far
away
perhaps
it
is
the
lack
of
love
that
keeps
the
power
alive
borkman
fixing
her
eyes
on
her
if
that
is
so
then
i
shall
soon
be
as
rich
as
you
ella
she
turns
and
goes
into
the
house
ella
rentheim
stands
for
a
time
looking
with
a
troubled
expression
at
borkman
then
lays
her
hand
cautiously
on
his
shoulder
come
john
you
must
come
in
too
borkman
as
if
wakening
i
ella
rentheim
yes
this
winter
air
is
too
keen
for
you
i
can
see
that
john
so
come
come
in
with
me
into
the
house
into
the
warmth
borkman
angrily
up
to
the
gallery
again
i
suppose
ella
rentheim
no
rather
into
the
room
below
borkman
his
anger
flaming
forth
never
will
i
set
foot
under
that
roof
again
ella
rentheim
where
will
you
go
then
so
late
and
in
the
dark
john
borkman
putting
on
his
hat
first
of
all
i
will
go
out
and
see
to
all
my
buried
treasures
ella
rentheim
looking
anxiously
at
him
john
i
do
understand
you
borkman
with
laughter
interrupted
by
coughing
oh
it
is
not
hidden
plunder
i
mean
do
be
afraid
of
that
ella
stopping
and
pointing
outwards
do
you
see
that
man
there
who
is
it
vilhelm
foldal
in
an
old
cape
covered
with
snow
with
his
turned
down
and
a
large
umbrella
in
his
hand
advances
towards
the
corner
of
the
house
laboriously
stumbling
through
the
snow
he
is
noticeably
lame
in
his
left
foot
borkman
vilhelm
what
do
you
want
with
me
again
foldal
looking
up
good
heavens
are
you
out
on
the
steps
john
gabriel
bowing
and
borkman
too
i
see
borkman
shortly
this
is
not
borkman
foldal
oh
i
beg
pardon
you
see
i
have
lost
my
spectacles
in
the
snow
but
how
is
it
that
you
who
never
put
your
foot
out
of
doors
borkman
carelessly
and
gaily
it
is
high
time
i
should
come
out
into
the
open
air
again
do
you
see
nearly
three
years
in
detention
five
years
in
prison
eight
years
in
the
gallery
up
there
ella
rentheim
distressed
borkman
i
beg
you
foldal
ah
yes
yes
yes
borkman
but
i
want
to
know
what
has
brought
you
here
foldal
still
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
wanted
to
come
up
to
you
john
gabriel
i
felt
i
must
come
to
you
in
the
gallery
ah
me
that
gallery
borkman
did
you
want
to
come
up
to
me
after
i
had
shown
you
the
door
foldal
oh
i
could
let
that
stand
in
the
way
borkman
what
have
you
done
to
your
foot
i
see
you
are
limping
foldal
yes
what
do
you
think
i
have
been
run
over
ella
rentheim
run
over
foldal
yes
by
a
covered
sledge
borkman
oho
foldal
with
two
horses
they
came
down
the
hill
at
a
tearing
gallop
i
could
get
out
of
the
way
quick
enough
and
so
ella
rentheim
and
so
they
ran
over
you
foldal
they
came
right
down
upon
me
madam
or
miss
they
came
right
upon
me
and
sent
me
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
snow
so
that
i
lost
my
spectacles
and
got
my
umbrella
broken
rubbing
his
leg
and
my
ankle
a
little
hurt
too
borkman
laughing
inwardly
do
you
know
who
were
in
that
sledge
vilhelm
foldal
no
how
could
i
see
it
was
a
covered
sledge
and
the
curtains
were
down
and
the
driver
did
stop
a
moment
after
he
had
sent
me
spinning
but
it
does
matter
a
bit
for
with
an
outburst
oh
i
am
so
happy
so
happy
borkman
happy
foldal
well
i
do
exactly
know
what
to
call
it
but
i
think
happy
is
the
nearest
word
for
something
wonderful
has
happened
and
that
is
why
i
could
help
i
had
to
come
out
and
share
my
happiness
with
you
john
gabriel
borkman
harshly
well
share
away
then
ella
rentheim
oh
but
first
take
your
friend
indoors
with
you
borkman
borkman
sternly
i
have
told
you
i
will
not
go
into
the
house
ella
rentheim
but
do
you
hear
he
has
been
run
over
borkman
oh
we
are
all
of
us
run
over
sometime
or
other
in
life
the
thing
is
to
jump
up
again
and
let
no
one
see
you
are
hurt
foldal
that
is
a
profound
saying
john
gabriel
but
i
can
easily
tell
you
my
story
out
here
in
a
few
words
borkman
more
mildly
yes
please
do
vilhelm
foldal
well
now
you
shall
hear
only
think
when
i
got
home
this
evening
after
i
had
been
with
you
what
did
i
find
but
a
letter
can
you
guess
who
it
was
from
borkman
possibly
from
your
little
frida
foldal
precisely
think
of
your
hitting
on
it
at
once
yes
it
was
a
long
letter
from
frida
a
footman
had
brought
it
and
can
you
imagine
what
was
in
it
borkman
perhaps
it
was
to
say
to
her
mother
and
you
foldal
exactly
how
good
you
are
at
guessing
john
gabriel
yes
she
tells
me
that
wilton
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
her
and
she
is
to
go
abroad
with
her
and
study
music
and
wilton
has
engaged
a
teacher
who
is
to
accompany
them
on
the
journey
and
to
read
with
frida
for
unfortunately
she
has
been
a
good
deal
neglected
in
some
branches
you
see
borkman
shaken
with
inward
laughter
of
course
of
course
i
see
it
all
quite
clearly
vilhelm
foldal
eagerly
continuing
and
only
think
she
knew
nothing
about
the
arrangement
until
this
evening
at
that
party
you
know
h
and
yet
she
found
time
to
write
to
me
and
the
letter
is
such
a
beautiful
one
so
warm
and
affectionate
i
assure
you
there
is
not
a
trace
of
contempt
for
her
father
in
it
and
then
what
a
delicate
thought
it
was
to
say
to
us
by
letter
before
she
started
laughing
but
of
course
i
ca
let
her
go
like
that
borkman
looks
inquiringly
at
him
how
so
foldal
she
tells
me
that
they
start
early
morning
quite
early
borkman
oh
indeed
does
she
tell
you
that
foldal
laughing
and
rubbing
his
hands
yes
but
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
you
see
i
am
going
straight
up
to
wilton
borkman
this
evening
foldal
oh
it
not
so
very
late
yet
and
even
if
the
house
is
shut
up
i
shall
ring
without
hesitation
for
i
must
and
will
see
frida
before
she
starts
makes
a
movement
to
go
borkman
stop
a
moment
my
poor
vilhelm
you
may
spare
yourself
that
heavy
bit
of
road
foldal
oh
you
are
thinking
of
my
ankle
borkman
yes
and
in
any
case
you
wo
get
in
at
wilton
foldal
yes
indeed
i
will
i
go
on
ringing
and
knocking
till
some
one
comes
and
lets
me
in
for
i
must
and
will
see
frida
ella
rentheim
your
daughter
has
gone
already
foldal
foldal
stands
as
though
thunderstruck
has
frida
gone
already
are
you
quite
sure
who
told
you
borkman
we
had
it
from
her
future
teacher
foldal
indeed
and
who
is
he
borkman
a
certain
erhart
borkman
foldal
beaming
with
joy
your
son
john
gabriel
is
he
going
with
them
borkman
yes
it
is
he
that
is
to
help
wilton
with
little
education
foldal
oh
heaven
be
praised
then
the
child
is
in
the
best
of
hands
but
is
it
quite
certain
that
they
have
started
with
her
already
borkman
they
took
her
away
in
that
sledge
which
ran
you
over
in
the
road
foldal
clasping
his
hands
to
think
that
my
little
frida
was
in
that
magnificent
sledge
borkman
nodding
yes
yes
vilhelm
your
daughter
has
come
to
drive
in
her
carriage
and
master
erhart
too
tell
me
did
you
notice
the
silver
bells
foldal
yes
indeed
silver
bells
did
you
say
were
they
silver
real
genuine
silver
bells
borkman
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
that
everything
was
genuine
both
outside
and
in
foldal
in
quiet
emotion
is
it
strange
how
fortune
can
sometimes
befriend
one
it
is
my
my
little
gift
of
song
that
has
transmuted
itself
into
music
in
frida
so
after
all
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
i
was
born
a
poet
for
now
she
is
going
forth
into
the
great
wide
world
that
i
once
yearned
so
passionately
to
see
little
frida
sets
out
in
a
splendid
covered
sledge
with
silver
bells
on
the
harness
borkman

ella
rentheim
looking
at
him
with
suppressed
anxiety
you
are
so
pale
john

very
pale

the
effect
of
the
prison
air
up
yonder

never
seen

before

is
no
use
trying
to
lure
me
in
i
have
told
you
ella
rentheim
but
when
i
beg
and
implore
you
for
your
own
sake

maid
opens
the
door
and
stands
in
the
doorway
the
maid
i
beg
your
pardon

me
to

low
voice
to

lock
me
up
again
ella
rentheim
to
the
maid
borkman

not
quite
well
he
wants
to
have
a
little
fresh
air
before

in
the
maid
but
borkman
told
me
to
ella
rentheim

the
door

the
key
in
the
lock
the
maid
oh

well
i
leave
it
she
goes
into
the
house
again
borkman
stands
silent
for
a
moment
and
listens
then
goes
hastily
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
open
space
now
i
am
outside
the
walls
ella
now
they
will
never
get
hold
of
me
again
ella
rentheim
who
has
gone
down
to
him
but
you
are
a
free
man
in
there
too
john
you
can
come
and
go
just
as
you
please
borkman
softly
as
though
in
terror
never
under
a
roof
again
it
is
so
good
to
be
out
here
in
the
night
if
i
went
up
into
the
gallery
now
ceiling
and
walls
would
shrink
together
and
crush
me
crush
me
flat
as
a
fly
ella
rentheim
but
where
will
you
go
then
borkman
i
will
simply
go
on
and
on
and
on
i
will
try
if
i
can
not
make
my
way
to
freedom
and
life
and
human
beings
again
will
you
go
with
me
ella
ella
rentheim
i
now
borkman
yes
at
once
ella
rentheim
but
how
far
borkman
as
far
as
ever
i
can
ella
rentheim
oh
but
think
what
you
are
doing
out
in
this
raw
cold
winter
night
borkman
speaking
very
hoarsely
oho
my
lady
is
concerned
about
her
health
yes
yes
i
know
it
is
delicate
ella
rentheim
it
is
your
health
i
am
concerned
about
borkman
hohoho
a
dead
man
health
i
ca
help
laughing
at
you
ella
he
moves
onwards
ella
rentheim
following
him
holding
him
back
what
did
you
call
yourself
borkman
a
dead
man
i
said
do
you
remember
gunhild
told
me
to
lie
quiet
where
i
was
ella
rentheim
with
resolution
throwing
her
cloak
around
her
i
will
go
with
you
john
borkman
yes
we
two
belong
to
each
other
ella
advancing
so
come
they
have
gradually
passed
into
the
low
wood
on
the
left
it
conceals
them
little
by
little
until
they
are
quite
lost
to
sight
the
house
and
the
open
space
disappear
the
landscape
consisting
of
wooded
slopes
and
ridges
slowly
changes
and
grows
wilder
and
wilder
ella
rentheim
voice
is
heard
in
the
wood
to
the
right
where
are
we
going
john
i
do
recognise
this
place
borkman
voice
higher
up
just
follow
my
footprints
in
the
snow
ella
rentheim
voice
but
why
need
we
climb
so
high
borkman
voice
nearer
at
hand
we
must
go
up
the
winding
path
ella
rentheim
still
hidden
oh
but
i
ca
go
much
further
borkman
on
the
verge
of
the
wood
to
the
right
come
come
we
are
not
far
from
the
view
now
there
used
to
be
a
seat
there
ella
rentheim
appearing
among
the
trees
do
you
remember
it
borkman
you
can
rest
there
they
have
emerged
upon
a
small
open
plateau
in
the
wood
the
mountain
rises
abruptly
behind
them
to
the
left
far
below
an
extensive
fiord
landscape
with
high
ranges
in
the
distance
towering
one
above
the
other
on
the
plateau
to
the
left
a
dead
with
a
bench
under
it
the
snow
lies
deep
upon
the
plateau
borkman
and
after
him
ella
rentheim
enter
from
the
right
and
wade
with
difficulty
through
the
snow
borkman
stopping
at
the
verge
of
the
steep
declivity
on
the
left
come
here
ella
and
you
shall
see
ella
rentheim
coming
up
to
him
what
do
you
want
to
show
me
john
borkman
pointing
outwards
do
you
see
how
free
and
open
the
country
lies
before
us
away
to
the
far
horizon
ella
rentheim
we
have
often
sat
on
this
bench
before
and
looked
out
into
a
much
much
further
distance
borkman
it
was
a
dreamland
we
then
looked
out
over
ella
rentheim
nodding
sadly
it
was
the
dreamland
of
our
life
yes
and
now
that
land
is
buried
in
snow
and
the
old
tree
is
dead
borkman
not
listening
to
her
can
you
see
the
smoke
of
the
great
steamships
out
on
the
fiord
ella
rentheim
no
borkman
i
can
they
come
and
they
go
they
weave
a
network
of
fellowship
all
round
the
world
they
shed
light
and
warmth
over
the
souls
of
men
in
many
thousands
of
homes
that
was
what
i
dreamed
of
doing
ella
rentheim
softly
and
it
remained
a
dream
borkman
it
remained
a
dream
yes
listening
and
hark
down
by
the
river
dear
the
factories
are
working
my
factories
all
those
that
i
would
have
created
listen
do
you
hear
them
humming
the
night
shift
is
on
so
they
are
working
night
and
day
hark
hark
the
wheels
are
whirling
and
the
bands
are
flashing
round
and
round
and
round
ca
you
hear
ella
ella
rentheim
no
borkman
i
can
hear
it
ella
rentheim
anxiously
i
think
you
are
mistaken
john
borkman
more
and
more
fired
up
oh
but
all
these
they
are
only
like
the
outworks
around
the
kingdom
i
tell
you
ella
rentheim
the
kingdom
you
say
what
kingdom
borkman
my
kingdom
of
course
the
kingdom
i
was
on
the
point
of
conquering
when
i
when
i
died
ella
rentheim
shaken
in
a
low
voice
oh
john
john
borkman
and
now
there
it
lies
defenceless
masterless
exposed
to
all
the
robbers
and
plunderers
ella
do
you
see
the
mountain
chains
there
far
away
they
soar
they
tower
aloft
one
behind
the
other
that
is
my
vast
my
infinite
inexhaustible
kingdom
ella
rentheim
oh
but
there
comes
an
icy
blast
from
that
kingdom
john
borkman
that
blast
is
the
breath
of
life
to
me
that
blast
comes
to
me
like
a
greeting
from
subject
spirits
i
seem
to
touch
them
the
prisoned
millions
i
can
see
the
veins
of
metal
stretch
out
their
winding
branching
luring
arms
to
me
i
saw
them
before
my
eyes
like
living
shapes
that
night
when
i
stood
in
the
with
the
candle
in
my
hand
you
begged
to
be
liberated
and
i
tried
to
free
you
but
my
strength
failed
me
and
the
treasure
sank
back
into
the
deep
again
with
outstretched
hands
but
i
will
whisper
it
to
you
here
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
i
love
you
as
you
lie
there
spellbound
in
the
deeps
and
the
darkness
i
love
you
unborn
treasures
yearning
for
the
light
i
love
you
with
all
your
shining
train
of
power
and
glory
i
love
you
love
you
love
you
ella
rentheim
in
suppressed
but
rising
agitation
yes
your
love
is
still
down
there
john
it
has
always
been
rooted
there
but
here
in
the
light
of
day
here
there
was
a
living
warm
human
heart
that
throbbed
and
glowed
for
you
and
this
heart
you
crushed
oh
worse
than
that
ten
times
worse
you
sold
it
for
for
borkman
trembles
a
cold
shudder
seems
to
go
through
him
for
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
you
mean
ella
rentheim
yes
that
is
what
i
mean
i
have
said
it
once
before
you
have
murdered
the
in
the
woman
who
loved
you
and
whom
you
loved
in
return
so
far
as
you
could
love
any
one
with
uplifted
arm
and
therefore
i
prophesy
to
you
john
gabriel
borkman
you
will
never
touch
the
price
you
demanded
for
the
murder
you
will
never
enter
in
triumph
into
your
cold
dark
kingdom
borkman
staggers
to
the
bench
and
seats
himself
heavily
i
almost
fear
your
prophecy
will
come
true
ella
ella
rentheim
going
up
to
him
you
must
not
fear
it
john
that
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
you
borkman
with
a
shriek
clutching
at
his
breast
ah
feebly
now
it
let
me
go
again
ella
rentheim
shaking
him
what
was
it
john
borkman
sinking
down
against
the
back
of
the
seat
it
was
a
hand
of
ice
that
clutched
at
my
heart
ella
rentheim
john
did
you
feel
the
again
borkman
murmurs
no
no
it
was
a
metal
hand
he
sinks
right
down
upon
the
bench
ella
rentheim
tears
off
her
cloak
and
throws
it
over
him
lie
still
where
you
are
i
will
go
and
bring
help
for
you
she
goes
a
step
or
two
towards
the
right
then
she
stops
returns
and
carefully
feels
his
pulse
and
touches
his
face
ella
rentheim
softly
and
firmly
no
it
is
best
so
john
borkman
best
for
you
she
spreads
the
cloak
closer
around
him
and
sinks
down
in
the
snow
in
front
of
the
bench
a
short
silence
borkman
wrapped
in
a
mantle
comes
through
the
wood
on
the
right
the
maid
goes
before
her
carrying
a
lantern
the
maid
throwing
the
light
upon
the
snow
yes
yes
here
are
their
tracks
borkman
peering
around
yes
here
they
are
they
are
sitting
there
on
the
bench
calls
ella
ella
rentheim
rising
are
you
looking
for
us
borkman
sternly
yes
you
see
i
have
to
ella
rentheim
pointing
look
there
he
lies
gunhild
borkman
sleeping
ella
rentheim
a
long
deep
sleep
i
think
borkman
with
an
outburst
ella
controls
herself
and
asks
in
a
low
voice
did
he
do
it
of
his
own
accord
ella
rentheim
no
borkman
relieved
not
by
his
own
hand
then
ella
rentheim
no
it
was
an
metal
hand
that
gripped
him
by
the
heart
borkman
to
the
maid
go
for
help
get
the
men
to
come
up
from
the
farm
the
maid
yes
i
will
to
herself
lord
save
us
she
goes
out
through
the
wood
to
the
right
borkman
standing
behind
the
bench
so
the
night
air
has
killed
him
ella
rentheim
so
it
appears
borkman
strong
man
that
he
was
ella
rentheim
coming
in
front
of
the
bench
will
you
not
look
at
him
gunhild
borkman
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
no
no
no
lowering
her
voice
he
was
a
miner
son
john
gabriel
borkman
he
could
not
live
in
the
fresh
air
ella
rentheim
it
was
rather
the
cold
that
killed
him
borkman
shakes
her
head
the
cold
you
say
the
cold
that
had
killed
him
long
ago
ella
rentheim
nodding
to
her
yes
and
changed
us
two
into
shadows
borkman
you
are
right
there
ella
rentheim
with
a
painful
smile
a
dead
man
and
two
shadows
that
is
what
the
cold
has
made
of
us
borkman
yes
the
coldness
of
and
now
i
think
we
two
may
hold
out
our
hands
to
each
other
ella
ella
rentheim
i
think
we
may
now
borkman
we
twin
sisters
over
him
we
have
both
loved
ella
rentheim
we
two
shadows
over
the
dead
man
borkman
behind
the
bench
and
ella
rentheim
in
front
of
it
take
each
other
hand
