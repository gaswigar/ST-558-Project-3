i
red
light
gryce
was
melancholy
he
had
attained
that
period
in
life
when
the
spirits
flag
and
enthusiasm
needs
a
constant
spur
and
of
late
there
had
been
a
lack
of
special
excitement
and
he
felt
dull
and
superannuated
he
was
even
contemplating
resigning
his
position
on
the
force
and
retiring
to
the
little
farm
he
had
bought
for
himself
in
westchester
and
this
in
itself
did
not
tend
to
cheerfulness
for
he
was
one
to
whom
action
was
a
necessity
and
the
exercise
of
his
mental
faculties
more
inspiring
than
any
possible
advantage
which
might
accrue
to
him
from
their
use
but
he
was
not
destined
to
carry
out
this
impulse
yet
for
just
at
the
height
of
his
secret
dissatisfaction
there
came
a
telephone
message
to
headquarters
which
roused
the
old
man
to
something
like
his
former
vigor
and
gave
to
the
close
of
this
gray
fall
day
an
interest
he
had
not
expected
to
feel
again
in
this
or
any
other
kind
of
day
it
was
sent
from
carter
drug
store
and
was
to
the
effect
that
a
lady
had
just
sent
a
boy
in
from
the
street
to
say
that
a
strange
crime
had
been
committed
in
mansion
round
the
corner
the
boy
did
not
know
the
lady
and
was
shy
about
showing
the
money
she
had
given
him
but
that
he
had
money
was
very
evident
also
that
he
was
frightened
enough
for
his
story
to
be
true
if
the
police
wished
to
communicate
with
him
he
could
be
found
at
carter
where
he
would
be
detained
till
an
order
for
his
release
should
be
received
a
crime
that
word
strange
struck
gryce
and
made
him
forget
his
years
in
wondering
what
it
meant
meanwhile
the
men
about
him
exchanged
remarks
upon
the
house
brought
thus
unexpectedly
to
their
notice
as
it
was
one
of
the
few
remaining
landmarks
of
the
preceding
century
and
had
been
made
conspicuous
moreover
by
the
shops
and
restaurants
pressing
against
it
on
either
side
it
had
been
a
marked
spot
for
years
even
to
those
who
knew
nothing
of
its
history
or
traditions
and
now
a
crime
had
taken
place
in
it
gryce
in
whose
ears
that
word
strange
rang
with
quiet
insistence
had
but
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
inspector
in
charge
to
receive
an
order
to
investigate
the
affair
he
started
at
once
and
proceeded
first
to
the
drug
store
there
he
found
the
boy
whom
he
took
along
with
him
to
the
house
indicated
in
the
message
on
the
way
he
made
him
talk
but
there
was
nothing
the
poor
waif
could
add
to
the
story
already
sent
over
the
telephone
he
persisted
in
saying
that
a
lady
he
did
not
say
woman
had
come
up
to
him
while
he
was
looking
at
some
toys
in
a
window
and
giving
him
a
piece
of
money
had
drawn
him
along
the
street
as
far
as
the
drug
store
here
she
showed
him
another
coin
promising
to
add
it
to
the
one
he
had
already
pocketed
if
he
would
run
in
to
the
telephone
clerk
with
a
message
for
the
police
he
wanted
the
money
and
when
he
grabbed
at
it
she
said
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
tell
the
clerk
that
a
strange
crime
had
been
committed
in
the
old
house
on
street
this
scared
him
and
he
was
sliding
off
when
she
caught
him
again
and
shook
him
until
his
wits
came
back
after
which
he
ran
into
the
store
and
delivered
the
message
there
was
candor
in
the
boy
tone
and
gryce
was
disposed
to
believe
him
but
when
he
was
asked
to
describe
the
lady
he
showed
that
his
powers
of
observation
were
no
better
than
those
of
most
of
his
class
all
he
could
say
was
that
she
was
a
stunner
and
wore
shiny
clothes
and
jewels
and
gryce
recognizing
the
lad
limitations
at
the
very
moment
he
found
himself
in
view
of
the
house
he
was
making
for
ceased
to
question
him
and
directed
all
his
attention
to
the
building
he
was
approaching
nothing
in
the
exterior
bespoke
crime
or
even
disturbance
a
shut
door
a
clean
stoop
heavily
curtained
windows
some
of
which
were
further
shielded
by
closely
drawn
shades
were
eloquent
of
inner
quiet
and
domestic
respectability
while
its
calm
front
of
brick
with
brownstone
trimmings
offered
a
pleasing
contrast
to
the
adjoining
buildings
jutting
out
on
either
side
alive
with
signs
and
humming
with
business
some
mistake
muttered
gryce
to
himself
as
the
perfect
calm
reigning
over
the
whole
establishment
struck
him
anew
but
before
he
had
decided
that
he
had
been
made
the
victim
of
a
hoax
a
movement
took
place
in
the
area
under
the
stoop
and
an
officer
stepped
out
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
sufficient
perplexity
for
gryce
to
motion
him
back
with
the
hurried
inquiry
anything
wrong
any
blood
shed
all
seems
quiet
here
the
officer
recognizing
the
old
detective
touched
his
hat
ca
get
in
said
he
have
rung
all
the
bells
would
think
the
house
empty
if
i
had
not
seen
something
like
a
stir
in
one
of
the
windows
overhead
shall
i
try
to
make
my
way
into
the
rear
yard
through
one
of
the
lower
windows
of
knapp
store
next
door
yes
and
take
this
boy
with
you
lock
him
up
in
some
one
of
their
offices
and
then
break
your
way
into
this
house
by
some
means
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
from
the
back
yard
the
officer
nodded
took
the
boy
by
the
arm
and
in
a
trice
had
disappeared
with
him
into
the
adjoining
store
gryce
remained
in
the
area
where
he
was
presently
besieged
by
a
crowd
of
eager
to
add
their
curiosity
to
the
trouble
they
had
so
quickly
scented
the
opening
of
the
door
from
the
inside
speedily
put
an
end
to
importunities
for
which
he
had
as
yet
no
reply
and
he
was
enabled
to
slip
within
where
he
found
himself
in
a
place
of
almost
absolute
quiet
before
him
lay
a
basement
hall
leading
to
a
kitchen
which
even
at
that
moment
he
noticed
to
be
in
trimmer
condition
than
is
usual
where
much
housework
is
done
but
he
saw
nothing
that
bespoke
tragedy
or
even
a
break
in
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
as
observed
in
houses
of
like
size
and
pretension
satisfied
that
what
he
sought
was
not
to
be
found
here
he
followed
the
officer
upstairs
as
they
emerged
upon
the
parlor
floor
the
latter
dropped
the
following
information
raffner
of
the
firm
next
door
says
that
the
man
who
lives
here
is
an
odd
sort
of
person
whom
nobody
knows
a
bookworm
i
think
they
call
him
he
has
occupied
the
house
six
months
yet
they
have
never
seen
any
one
about
the
premise
but
himself
and
a
strange
old
servant
as
peculiar
and
uncommunicative
as
his
master
i
know
muttered
gryce
he
did
know
everybody
knew
that
this
house
once
the
seat
of
one
of
new
york
most
aristocratic
families
was
inhabited
at
present
by
a
adams
noted
alike
for
his
more
than
common
personal
attractions
his
wealth
and
the
uncongenial
nature
of
his
temperament
which
precluded
all
association
with
his
kind
it
was
this
knowledge
which
had
given
zest
to
this
investigation
to
enter
the
house
of
such
a
man
was
an
event
in
itself
to
enter
it
on
an
errand
of
life
and
death
well
it
is
under
the
inspiration
of
such
opportunities
that
life
is
reawakened
in
old
veins
especially
when
those
veins
connect
the
heart
and
brain
of
a
sagacious
if
octogenarian
detective
the
hall
in
which
they
now
found
themselves
was
wide
and
sparsely
furnished
in
the
ancient
manner
to
be
observed
in
such
structures
two
doors
led
into
this
hall
both
of
which
now
stood
open
taking
advantage
of
this
fact
they
entered
the
nearest
which
was
nearly
opposite
the
top
of
the
staircase
they
had
just
ascended
and
found
themselves
in
a
room
barren
as
a
doctor
outer
office
there
was
nothing
here
worth
their
attention
and
they
would
have
left
the
place
as
unceremoniously
as
they
had
entered
it
if
they
had
not
caught
glimpses
of
richness
which
promised
an
interior
of
uncommon
elegance
behind
the
folds
of
a
portière
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
advancing
through
the
doorway
thus
indicated
they
took
one
look
about
them
and
stood
appalled
nothing
in
their
experience
and
they
had
both
experienced
much
had
prepared
them
for
the
thrilling
the
solemn
nature
of
what
they
were
here
called
upon
to
contemplate
shall
i
attempt
its
description
a
room
small
and
of
circular
shape
hung
with
strange
tapestries
relieved
here
and
there
by
priceless
curios
and
lit
although
it
was
still
daylight
by
a
jet
of
light
concentrated
not
on
the
rows
and
rows
of
books
around
the
lower
portion
of
the
room
or
on
the
one
great
picture
which
at
another
time
might
have
drawn
the
eye
and
held
the
attention
but
on
the
upturned
face
of
a
man
lying
on
a
bearskin
rug
with
a
dagger
in
his
heart
and
on
his
breast
a
cross
whose
golden
lines
sharply
outlined
against
his
long
dark
swathing
garment
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
saint
prepared
in
some
holy
place
for
burial
save
that
the
dagger
spoke
of
violent
death
and
his
face
of
an
anguish
for
which
gryce
notwithstanding
his
lifelong
experience
found
no
name
so
little
did
it
answer
to
a
sensation
of
fear
pain
or
surprise
or
any
of
the
emotions
usually
visible
on
the
countenances
of
such
as
have
fallen
under
the
unexpected
stroke
of
an
assassin
chapter
ii
mysteries
a
moment
of
indecision
of
awe
even
elapsed
before
gryce
recovered
himself
the
dim
light
the
awesome
silence
the
unexpected
surroundings
recalling
a
romantic
age
the
motionless
figure
of
him
who
so
lately
had
been
the
master
of
the
house
lying
outstretched
as
for
the
tomb
with
the
sacred
symbol
on
his
breast
offering
such
violent
contradiction
to
the
earthly
passion
which
had
driven
the
dagger
home
were
enough
to
move
even
the
tried
spirit
of
this
old
officer
of
the
law
and
confuse
a
mind
which
in
the
years
of
his
long
connection
with
the
force
had
had
many
serious
problems
to
work
upon
but
never
one
just
like
this
it
was
only
for
a
moment
though
before
the
man
behind
him
had
given
utterance
to
his
own
bewilderment
and
surprise
gryce
had
passed
in
and
taken
his
stand
by
the
prostrate
figure
that
it
was
that
of
a
man
who
had
long
since
ceased
to
breathe
he
could
not
for
a
moment
doubt
yet
his
first
act
was
to
make
sure
of
the
fact
by
laying
his
hand
on
the
pulse
and
examining
the
eyes
whose
expression
of
reproach
was
such
that
he
had
to
call
up
all
his
professional
sangfroid
to
meet
them
he
found
the
body
still
warm
but
dead
beyond
all
question
and
once
convinced
of
this
he
forbore
to
draw
the
dagger
from
the
wound
though
he
did
not
fail
to
give
it
the
most
careful
attention
before
turning
his
eyes
elsewhere
it
was
no
ordinary
weapon
it
was
a
curio
from
some
oriental
shop
this
in
itself
seemed
to
point
to
suicide
but
the
direction
in
which
the
blade
had
entered
the
body
and
the
position
of
the
wound
were
not
such
as
would
be
looked
for
in
a
case
of
the
other
clews
were
few
though
the
scene
had
been
one
of
bloodshed
and
death
the
undoubted
result
of
a
sudden
and
fierce
attack
there
were
no
signs
of
struggle
to
be
found
in
the
apartment
beyond
a
few
rose
leaves
scattered
on
the
floor
the
room
was
a
scene
of
peace
and
quiet
luxury
even
the
large
table
which
occupied
the
centre
of
the
room
and
near
which
the
master
of
the
house
had
been
standing
when
struck
gave
no
token
of
the
tragedy
which
had
been
enacted
at
its
side
that
is
not
at
first
glance
for
though
its
large
top
was
covered
with
articles
of
use
and
ornament
they
all
stood
undisturbed
and
presumably
in
place
as
if
the
shock
which
had
laid
their
owner
low
had
failed
to
be
communicated
to
his
belongings
the
contents
of
the
table
were
various
only
a
man
of
complex
tastes
and
attainments
could
have
collected
and
arranged
in
one
small
compass
pipes
pens
portraits
weights
measures
roman
lamps
venetian
glass
rare
porcelains
medals
rough
metal
work
manuscript
a
scroll
of
music
a
pot
of
growing
flowers
and
and
this
seemed
oddest
of
all
a
row
of
electric
buttons
which
gryce
no
sooner
touched
than
the
light
which
had
been
burning
redly
in
the
cage
of
fretted
ironwork
overhead
changed
in
a
twinkling
to
a
greenish
glare
filling
the
room
with
such
ghastly
tints
that
gryce
sought
in
haste
another
button
and
pressing
it
was
glad
to
see
a
mild
white
radiance
take
the
place
of
the
sickly
hue
which
had
added
its
own
horror
to
the
already
solemn
terrors
of
the
spot
childish
tricks
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
position
ruminated
gryce
but
after
catching
another
glimpse
of
the
face
lying
upturned
at
his
feet
he
was
conscious
of
a
doubt
as
to
whether
the
owner
of
that
countenance
could
have
possessed
an
instinct
which
was
in
any
wise
childish
so
strong
and
purposeful
were
his
sharply
cut
features
indeed
the
face
was
one
to
make
an
impression
under
any
circumstances
in
the
present
instance
and
with
such
an
expression
stamped
upon
it
it
exerted
a
fascination
which
disturbed
the
current
of
the
thoughts
whenever
by
any
chance
he
allowed
it
to
get
between
him
and
his
duty
to
attribute
folly
to
a
man
with
such
a
mouth
and
such
a
chin
was
to
own
one
self
a
poor
judge
of
human
nature
therefore
the
lamp
overhead
with
its
electric
connection
and
changing
slides
had
a
meaning
which
at
present
could
be
sought
for
only
in
the
evidences
of
scientific
research
observable
in
the
books
and
apparatus
everywhere
surrounding
him
letting
the
white
light
burn
on
gryce
by
a
characteristic
effort
shifted
his
attention
to
the
walls
covered
as
i
have
said
with
tapestries
and
curios
there
was
nothing
on
them
calculated
to
aid
him
in
his
research
into
the
secret
of
this
crime
unless
yes
there
something
a
nail
wrenched
from
its
place
the
nail
on
which
the
cross
had
hung
which
now
lay
upon
the
dead
man
heart
the
cord
by
which
it
had
been
suspended
still
clung
to
the
cross
and
mingled
its
red
threads
with
that
other
scarlet
thread
which
had
gone
to
meet
it
from
the
victim
wounded
breast
who
had
torn
down
that
cross
not
the
victim
himself
with
such
a
wound
any
such
movement
would
have
been
impossible
besides
the
nail
and
the
empty
place
on
the
wall
were
as
far
removed
from
where
he
lay
as
was
possible
in
the
somewhat
circumscribed
area
of
this
circular
apartment
another
hand
then
had
pulled
down
this
symbol
of
peace
and
pardon
and
placed
it
where
the
dying
man
fleeting
breath
would
play
across
it
a
peculiar
exhibition
of
religious
hope
or
mad
remorse
to
the
significance
of
which
gryce
could
not
devote
more
than
a
passing
thought
so
golden
were
the
moments
in
which
he
found
himself
alone
upon
this
scene
of
crime
behind
the
table
and
up
the
wall
was
a
picture
the
only
large
picture
in
the
room
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
young
girl
of
an
extremely
interesting
and
pathetic
beauty
from
her
garb
and
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
it
had
evidently
been
painted
about
the
end
of
our
civil
war
in
it
was
to
be
observed
the
same
haunting
quality
of
intellectual
charm
visible
in
the
man
lying
prone
upon
the
floor
and
though
she
was
fair
and
he
dark
there
was
sufficient
likeness
between
the
two
to
argue
some
sort
of
relationship
between
them
below
this
picture
were
fastened
a
sword
a
pair
of
epaulettes
and
a
medal
such
as
was
awarded
for
valor
in
the
civil
war
mementoes
which
may
help
us
in
our
task
mused
the
detective
passing
on
he
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
narrow
curtain
so
dark
of
hue
and
so
akin
in
pattern
to
the
draperies
on
the
adjoining
walls
that
it
had
up
to
this
time
escaped
his
attention
it
was
not
that
of
a
window
for
such
windows
as
were
to
be
seen
in
this
unique
apartment
were
high
upon
the
wall
indeed
almost
under
the
ceiling
it
must
therefore
drape
the
opening
into
still
another
communicating
room
and
such
he
found
to
be
the
case
pushing
this
curtain
aside
he
entered
a
narrow
closet
containing
a
bed
a
dresser
and
a
small
table
the
bed
was
the
narrow
cot
of
a
bachelor
and
the
dresser
that
of
a
man
of
luxurious
tastes
and
the
utmost
nicety
of
habit
both
the
bed
and
dresser
were
in
perfect
order
save
for
a
comb
which
had
been
taken
from
the
latter
and
which
he
presently
found
lying
on
the
floor
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
this
and
the
presence
of
a
parasol
on
a
small
stand
near
the
door
proclaimed
that
a
woman
had
been
there
within
a
short
space
of
time
the
identity
of
this
woman
was
soon
established
in
his
eyes
by
a
small
but
unmistakable
token
connecting
her
with
the
one
who
had
been
the
means
of
sending
in
the
alarm
to
the
police
the
token
of
which
i
speak
was
a
little
black
spangle
called
by
milliners
and
a
sequin
which
lay
on
the
threshold
separating
this
room
from
the
study
and
as
gryce
attracted
by
its
sparkle
stooped
to
examine
it
his
eye
caught
sight
of
a
similar
one
on
the
floor
beyond
and
of
still
another
a
few
steps
farther
on
the
last
one
lay
close
to
the
large
before
which
he
had
just
been
standing
the
dainty
trail
formed
by
these
bright
sparkling
drops
seemed
to
affect
him
oddly
he
knew
minute
observer
that
he
was
that
in
the
manufacture
of
this
garniture
the
spangles
are
strung
on
a
thread
which
if
once
broken
allows
them
to
drop
away
one
by
one
till
you
can
almost
follow
a
woman
so
arrayed
by
the
sequins
that
fall
from
her
perhaps
it
was
the
delicate
nature
of
the
clew
thus
offered
that
pleased
him
perhaps
it
was
a
recognition
of
the
irony
of
fate
in
thus
making
a
trap
for
unwary
mortals
out
of
their
vanities
whatever
it
was
the
smile
with
which
he
turned
his
eye
upon
the
table
toward
which
he
had
thus
been
led
was
very
eloquent
but
before
examining
this
article
of
furniture
more
closely
he
attempted
to
find
out
where
the
thread
had
become
loosened
which
had
let
the
spangles
fall
had
it
caught
on
any
projection
in
doorway
or
furniture
he
saw
none
all
the
chairs
were
cushioned
and
but
wait
there
was
the
cross
that
had
a
fretwork
of
gold
at
its
base
might
not
this
filagree
have
caught
in
her
dress
as
she
was
tearing
down
the
cross
from
the
wall
and
so
have
started
the
thread
which
had
given
him
this
exquisite
clew
hastening
to
the
spot
where
the
cross
had
hung
he
searched
the
floor
at
his
feet
but
found
nothing
to
confirm
his
conjecture
until
he
had
reached
the
rug
on
which
the
prostrate
man
lay
there
amid
the
long
hairs
of
the
bearskin
he
came
upon
one
other
spangle
and
knew
that
the
woman
in
the
shiny
clothes
had
stooped
there
before
him
satisfied
on
this
point
he
returned
to
the
table
and
this
time
subjected
it
to
a
thorough
and
minute
examination
that
the
result
was
not
entirely
unsatisfactory
was
evident
from
the
smile
with
which
he
eyed
his
finger
after
having
drawn
it
across
a
certain
spot
near
the
inkstand
and
also
from
the
care
with
which
he
lifted
that
inkstand
and
replaced
it
in
precisely
the
same
spot
from
which
he
had
taken
it
up
had
he
expected
to
find
something
concealed
under
it
who
can
tell
a
detective
face
seldom
yields
up
its
secrets
he
was
musing
quite
intently
before
this
table
when
a
quick
step
behind
him
made
him
turn
styles
the
officer
having
now
been
over
the
house
had
returned
and
was
standing
before
him
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
has
something
to
say
what
is
it
asked
gryce
with
a
quick
movement
in
his
direction
for
answer
the
officer
pointed
to
the
staircase
visible
through
the
antechamber
door
go
up
was
indicated
by
his
gesture
gryce
demurred
casting
a
glance
around
the
room
which
at
that
moment
interested
him
so
deeply
at
this
the
man
showed
some
excitement
and
breaking
silence
said
come
i
have
lighted
on
the
guilty
party
he
is
in
a
room
upstairs
he
gryce
was
evidently
surprised
at
the
pronoun
yes
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
when
you
see
him
but
what
is
that
is
he
coming
down
i
sure
there
nobody
else
in
the
house
do
you
hear
footsteps
sir
gryce
nodded
some
one
was
certainly
descending
the
stairs
let
us
retreat
suggested
styles
not
because
the
man
is
dangerous
but
because
it
is
very
necessary
you
should
see
him
before
he
sees
you
he
a
very
man
sir
and
if
he
comes
in
here
will
be
sure
to
do
something
to
incriminate
himself
where
can
we
hide
gryce
remembered
the
little
room
he
had
just
left
and
drew
the
officer
toward
it
once
installed
inside
he
let
the
curtain
drop
till
only
a
small
loophole
remained
the
steps
which
had
been
gradually
growing
louder
kept
advancing
and
presently
they
could
hear
the
intruder
breathing
which
was
both
quick
and
labored
does
he
know
that
any
one
has
entered
the
house
did
he
see
you
when
you
came
upon
him
upstairs
whispered
gryce
into
the
ear
of
the
man
beside
him
styles
shook
his
head
and
pointed
eagerly
toward
the
opposite
door
the
man
for
whose
appearance
they
waited
had
just
lifted
the
portière
and
in
another
moment
stood
in
full
view
just
inside
the
threshold
gryce
and
his
attendant
colleague
both
stared
was
this
the
murderer
this
pale
lean
servitor
with
a
tray
in
his
hand
on
which
rested
a
single
glass
of
water
gryce
was
so
astonished
that
he
looked
at
styles
for
explanation
but
that
officer
hiding
his
own
surprise
for
he
had
not
expected
this
peaceful
figure
urged
him
in
a
whisper
to
have
patience
and
both
turning
toward
the
man
again
beheld
him
advance
stop
cast
one
look
at
the
figure
lying
on
the
floor
and
then
let
slip
the
glass
with
a
low
cry
that
at
once
changed
to
something
like
a
howl
look
at
him
look
at
him
urged
styles
in
a
hurried
whisper
watch
what
he
will
do
now
you
will
see
a
murderer
at
work
and
sure
enough
in
another
instant
this
strange
being
losing
all
semblance
to
his
former
self
entered
upon
a
series
of
pantomimic
actions
which
to
the
two
men
who
watched
him
seemed
both
to
explain
and
illustrate
the
crime
which
had
just
been
enacted
there
with
every
appearance
of
passion
he
stood
contemplating
the
empty
air
before
him
and
then
with
one
hand
held
stretched
out
behind
him
in
a
peculiarly
cramped
position
he
plunged
with
the
other
toward
a
table
from
which
he
made
a
feint
of
snatching
something
which
he
no
sooner
closed
his
hand
upon
than
he
gave
a
quick
still
at
the
empty
air
which
seemed
to
quiver
in
return
so
vigorous
was
his
action
and
so
evident
his
intent
the
reaction
following
this
thrust
the
slow
unclosing
of
his
hand
from
an
imaginary
dagger
the
tottering
of
his
body
backward
then
the
moment
when
with
wide
open
eyes
he
seemed
to
contemplate
in
horror
the
result
of
his
own
deed
these
needed
no
explanation
beyond
what
was
given
by
his
writhing
features
and
trembling
body
gradually
succumbing
to
the
remorse
or
terror
of
his
own
crime
he
sank
lower
and
lower
until
though
with
that
one
arm
still
stretched
out
he
lay
in
an
inert
heap
on
the
floor
it
is
what
i
saw
him
do
upstairs
murmured
styles
into
the
ear
of
the
amazed
detective
he
has
evidently
been
driven
insane
by
his
own
act
gryce
made
no
answer
here
was
a
problem
for
the
solution
of
which
he
found
no
precedent
in
all
his
past
experience
chapter
iii
the
mute
servitor
meanwhile
the
man
who
to
all
appearance
had
just
before
them
the
tragedy
which
had
so
lately
taken
place
in
this
room
rose
to
his
feet
and
with
a
dazed
air
as
unlike
his
former
violent
expression
as
possible
stooped
for
the
glass
he
had
let
fall
and
was
carrying
it
out
when
gryce
called
to
him
wait
man
you
need
take
that
glass
away
we
first
want
to
hear
how
your
master
comes
to
be
lying
here
dead
it
was
a
demand
calculated
to
startle
any
man
but
this
one
showed
himself
totally
unmoved
by
it
and
was
passing
on
when
styles
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
his
shoulder
stop
said
he
what
do
you
mean
by
sliding
off
like
this
do
you
hear
the
gentleman
speaking
to
you
this
time
the
appeal
told
the
glass
fell
again
from
the
man
hand
mingling
its
clink
for
it
struck
the
floor
this
time
and
broke
with
the
cry
he
gave
which
was
not
exactly
a
cry
either
but
an
odd
sound
between
a
moan
and
a
shriek
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
men
who
were
seeking
to
detain
him
and
his
haggard
look
and
cringing
form
showed
that
he
realized
at
last
the
terrors
of
his
position
next
minute
he
sought
to
escape
but
styles
gripping
him
more
firmly
dragged
him
back
to
where
gryce
stood
beside
the
bearskin
rug
on
which
lay
the
form
of
his
dead
master
instantly
at
the
sight
of
this
recumbent
figure
another
change
took
place
in
the
entrapped
butler
joy
that
most
hellish
of
passions
in
the
presence
of
violence
and
death
illumined
his
wandering
eye
and
distorted
his
mouth
and
seeking
no
disguise
for
the
satisfaction
he
felt
he
uttered
a
low
but
thrilling
laugh
which
rang
in
unholy
echo
through
the
room
gryce
moved
in
spite
of
himself
by
an
abhorrence
which
the
irresponsible
condition
of
this
man
seemed
only
to
emphasize
waited
till
the
last
faint
sounds
of
this
diabolical
mirth
had
died
away
in
the
high
recesses
of
the
space
above
then
fixing
the
glittering
eye
of
this
strange
creature
with
his
own
which
as
we
know
so
seldom
dwelt
upon
that
of
his
he
sternly
said
there
now
speak
who
killed
this
man
you
were
in
the
house
with
him
and
should
know
the
butler
lips
opened
and
a
string
of
strange
gutturals
poured
forth
while
with
his
one
disengaged
hand
for
the
other
was
held
to
his
side
by
styles
he
touched
his
ears
and
his
lips
and
violently
shook
his
head
there
was
but
one
interpretation
to
be
given
to
this
the
man
was
deaf
and
dumb
the
shock
of
this
discovery
was
too
much
for
styles
his
hand
fell
from
the
other
arms
and
the
man
finding
himself
free
withdrew
to
his
former
place
in
the
room
where
he
proceeded
to
enact
again
and
with
increased
vivacity
first
the
killing
of
and
then
the
mourning
for
his
master
which
but
a
few
moments
before
had
made
so
suggestive
an
impression
upon
them
this
done
he
stood
waiting
but
this
time
with
that
gleam
of
infernal
joy
in
the
depths
of
his
quick
restless
eyes
which
made
his
very
presence
in
this
room
of
death
seem
a
sacrilege
and
horror
styles
could
not
stand
it
ca
you
speak
he
shouted
ca
you
hear
the
man
only
smiled
an
evil
and
gloating
smile
which
gryce
thought
it
his
duty
to
cut
short
take
him
away
he
cried
examine
him
carefully
for
blood
marks
i
am
going
up
to
the
room
where
you
saw
him
first
he
is
too
nearly
linked
to
this
crime
not
to
carry
some
trace
of
it
away
with
him
but
for
once
even
this
detective
found
himself
at
fault
no
marks
were
found
on
the
old
servant
nor
could
they
discover
in
the
rooms
above
any
signs
by
which
this
one
remaining
occupant
of
the
house
could
be
directly
associated
with
the
crime
which
had
taken
place
within
it
thereupon
gryce
grew
very
thoughtful
and
entered
upon
another
examination
of
the
two
rooms
which
to
his
mind
held
all
the
clews
that
would
ever
be
given
to
this
strange
crime
the
result
was
meagre
and
he
was
just
losing
himself
again
in
contemplation
of
the
upturned
face
whose
fixed
mouth
and
haunting
expression
told
such
a
story
of
suffering
and
determination
when
there
came
from
the
dim
recesses
above
his
head
a
cry
which
forming
itself
into
two
words
rang
down
with
startling
clearness
in
this
most
unexpected
of
appeals
remember
evelyn
remember
evelyn
who
was
evelyn
and
to
whom
did
this
voice
belong
in
a
house
which
had
already
been
ransacked
in
vain
for
other
occupants
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
roof
and
sure
enough
when
gryce
looked
up
he
saw
swinging
in
a
cage
strung
up
nearly
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
windows
i
have
mentioned
an
english
starling
which
in
seeming
recognition
of
the
attention
it
had
drawn
upon
itself
craned
its
neck
as
gryce
looked
up
and
shrieked
again
with
fiercer
insistence
than
before
remember
evelyn
it
was
the
last
uncanny
touch
in
a
series
of
uncanny
experiences
with
an
odd
sense
of
nightmare
upon
him
gryce
leaned
forward
on
the
study
table
in
his
effort
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
this
bird
when
without
warning
the
white
light
which
since
his
last
contact
with
the
electrical
apparatus
had
spread
itself
through
the
room
changed
again
to
green
and
he
realized
that
he
had
unintentionally
pressed
a
button
and
thus
brought
into
action
another
slide
in
the
curious
lamp
over
his
head
annoyed
for
these
changing
hues
offered
a
problem
he
was
as
yet
too
absorbed
in
other
matters
to
make
any
attempt
to
solve
he
left
the
vicinity
of
the
table
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
he
heard
styles
voice
rise
from
the
adjoining
antechamber
where
styles
was
keeping
guard
over
the
old
butler
shall
i
let
him
go
gryce
he
seems
very
uneasy
not
dangerous
you
know
but
anxious
as
if
he
had
forgotten
something
or
recalled
some
unfulfilled
duty
yes
let
him
go
was
the
detective
quick
reply
only
watch
and
follow
him
every
movement
he
makes
is
of
interest
unconsciously
he
may
be
giving
us
invaluable
clews
and
he
approached
the
door
to
note
for
himself
what
the
man
might
do
remember
evelyn
rang
out
the
startling
cry
from
above
as
the
detective
passed
between
the
curtains
irresistibly
he
looked
back
and
up
to
whom
was
this
appeal
from
a
bird
throat
so
imperatively
addressed
to
him
or
to
the
man
on
the
floor
beneath
whose
ears
were
forever
closed
it
might
be
a
matter
of
little
consequence
and
it
might
be
one
involving
the
very
secret
of
this
tragedy
but
whether
important
or
not
he
could
pay
no
heed
to
it
at
this
juncture
for
the
old
butler
coming
from
the
front
hall
whither
he
had
hurried
on
being
released
by
styles
was
at
that
moment
approaching
him
carrying
in
one
hand
his
master
hat
and
in
the
other
his
master
umbrella
not
knowing
what
this
new
movement
might
mean
gryce
paused
where
he
was
and
waited
for
the
man
to
advance
seeing
this
the
mute
to
whose
face
and
bearing
had
returned
the
respectful
immobility
of
the
trained
servant
handed
over
the
articles
he
had
brought
and
then
noiselessly
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
performed
an
expected
service
retreated
to
his
old
place
in
the
antechamber
where
he
sat
down
again
and
fell
almost
immediately
into
his
former
dazed
condition
humph
mind
quite
lost
memory
uncertain
testimony
valueless
were
the
dissatisfied
reflections
of
the
disappointed
detective
as
he
replaced
adams
hat
and
umbrella
on
the
hall
rack
has
he
been
brought
to
this
state
by
the
tragedy
which
has
just
taken
place
here
or
is
his
present
insane
condition
its
precursor
and
cause
gryce
might
have
found
some
answer
to
this
question
in
his
own
mind
if
at
that
moment
the
fitful
clanging
of
the
front
door
bell
which
had
hitherto
testified
to
the
impatience
of
the
curious
crowd
outside
had
not
been
broken
into
by
an
authoritative
knock
which
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
the
coroner
or
some
equally
important
person
was
at
hand
and
the
detective
golden
hour
was
over
chapter
iv
a
new
experience
for
gryce
gryce
felt
himself
at
a
greater
disadvantage
in
his
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
this
affair
than
in
any
other
which
he
had
entered
upon
in
years
first
the
victim
had
been
a
solitary
man
with
no
household
save
his
the
mute
secondly
he
had
lived
in
a
portion
of
the
city
where
no
neighbors
were
possible
and
he
had
even
lacked
as
it
now
seemed
any
very
active
friends
though
some
hours
had
elapsed
since
his
death
had
been
noised
abroad
no
one
had
appeared
at
the
door
with
inquiries
or
information
this
seemed
odd
considering
that
he
had
been
for
some
months
a
marked
figure
in
this
quarter
of
the
town
but
then
everything
about
this
man
was
odd
nor
would
it
have
been
in
keeping
with
his
surroundings
and
peculiar
manner
of
living
for
him
to
have
had
the
ordinary
associations
of
men
of
his
class
this
absence
of
the
usual
means
of
eliciting
knowledge
from
the
surrounding
people
added
to
rather
than
detracted
from
the
interest
which
gryce
was
bound
to
feel
in
the
case
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
a
little
before
midnight
he
saw
the
army
of
reporters
medical
men
officials
and
such
others
as
had
followed
in
the
wake
file
out
of
the
front
door
and
leave
him
again
for
a
few
hours
at
least
master
of
the
situation
for
there
were
yet
two
points
which
he
desired
to
settle
before
he
took
his
own
rest
the
first
occupied
his
immediate
attention
passing
before
a
chair
in
the
hall
on
which
a
small
boy
sat
dozing
he
roused
him
with
the
remark
come
jake
it
time
to
look
lively
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
the
exact
place
where
that
lady
ran
across
you
the
boy
half
dead
with
sleep
looked
around
him
for
his
hat
i
like
to
see
my
mother
first
he
pleaded
she
must
be
done
up
about
me
i
never
stayed
away
so
long
before
your
mother
knows
where
you
are
i
sent
a
message
to
her
hours
ago
she
gave
a
very
good
report
of
you
jake
says
you
an
obedient
lad
and
that
you
never
have
told
her
a
falsehood
she
a
good
mother
the
boy
warmly
declared
i
be
as
bad
as
bad
as
my
father
was
if
i
did
not
treat
her
well
here
his
hand
fell
on
his
cap
which
he
put
on
his
head
i
ready
said
he
gryce
at
once
led
the
way
into
the
street
the
hour
was
late
and
only
certain
portions
of
the
city
showed
any
real
activity
into
one
of
these
thoroughfares
they
presently
came
and
before
the
darkened
window
of
one
of
the
lesser
shops
paused
while
jake
pointed
out
the
two
stuffed
frogs
engaged
with
miniature
swords
in
mortal
combat
at
which
he
had
been
looking
when
the
lady
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
gryce
eyed
the
boy
rather
than
the
frogs
though
probably
the
former
would
have
sworn
that
his
attention
had
never
left
that
miniature
conflict
was
she
a
pretty
lady
he
asked
the
boy
scratched
his
head
in
some
perplexity
she
made
me
a
good
deal
afraid
of
her
he
said
she
had
very
splendid
clothes
oh
gorgeous
he
cried
as
if
on
this
question
there
could
be
no
doubt
and
she
was
young
and
carried
a
bunch
of
flowers
and
seemed
troubled
what
not
young
and
carried
no
flowers
and
was
even
anxious
and
trembling
the
boy
who
had
been
shaking
his
head
looked
nonplussed
i
think
as
she
was
what
you
might
call
troubled
but
she
was
crying
and
when
she
spoke
to
me
she
put
more
feeling
into
her
grip
than
into
her
voice
she
just
dragged
me
to
the
sir
if
she
given
me
money
first
i
should
have
wriggled
away
in
spite
of
her
but
i
likes
money
sir
i
do
get
too
much
of
it
gryce
by
this
time
was
moving
on
not
young
he
repeated
to
himself
some
old
flame
then
of
adams
they
apt
to
be
dangerous
very
dangerous
more
dangerous
than
the
young
ones
in
front
of
the
he
paused
show
me
where
she
stood
while
you
went
in
the
boy
pointed
out
the
identical
spot
he
seemed
as
eager
as
the
detective
and
was
she
standing
there
when
you
came
out
oh
no
sir
she
went
away
while
i
was
inside
did
you
see
her
go
can
you
tell
me
whether
she
went
up
street
or
down
i
had
one
eye
on
her
sir
i
was
afraid
she
was
coming
into
the
shop
after
me
and
my
arm
was
too
sore
for
me
to
want
her
to
clinch
hold
on
it
again
so
when
she
started
to
go
i
took
a
step
nearer
and
saw
her
move
toward
the
curbstone
and
hold
up
her
hand
but
it
was
a
car
she
was
after
for
none
came
by
for
several
minutes
the
fold
between
gryce
eyes
perceptibly
smoothed
out
then
it
was
some
cabman
or
she
hailed
were
there
any
empty
coaches
about
that
you
saw
the
boy
had
not
noticed
he
had
reached
the
limit
of
his
observations
and
no
amount
of
further
questioning
could
elicit
anything
more
from
him
this
gryce
soon
saw
and
giving
him
into
the
charge
of
one
of
his
assistants
who
was
on
duty
at
this
place
he
proceeded
back
to
the
house
where
the
tragedy
itself
had
occurred
any
one
waiting
for
me
he
inquired
of
styles
who
came
to
the
door
yes
sir
a
young
man
name
hines
says
he
an
electrician
that
the
man
i
want
where
is
he
in
the
parlor
sir
good
i
see
him
but
do
let
any
one
else
in
anybody
upstairs
no
sir
all
gone
shall
i
go
up
or
stay
here
you
better
go
up
i
look
after
the
door
styles
nodded
and
went
toward
the
stairs
up
which
he
presently
disappeared
gryce
proceeded
to
the
parlor
a
dapper
young
man
with
an
intelligent
eye
rose
to
meet
him
you
sent
for
me
said
he
the
detective
nodded
asked
a
few
questions
and
seeming
satisfied
with
the
replies
he
received
led
the
way
into
adams
study
from
which
the
body
had
been
removed
to
an
upper
room
as
they
entered
a
mild
light
greeted
them
from
a
candle
which
by
gryce
orders
had
been
placed
on
a
small
side
table
near
the
door
but
once
in
gryce
approached
the
larger
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
placing
his
hand
on
one
of
the
buttons
before
him
asked
his
companion
to
be
kind
enough
to
blow
out
the
candle
this
he
did
leaving
the
room
for
a
moment
in
total
darkness
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
illumination
a
marvellous
glow
of
a
deep
violet
color
shot
over
the
whole
room
and
the
two
men
turned
and
faced
each
other
both
with
inquiry
in
their
looks
so
unexpected
was
this
theatrical
effect
to
the
one
and
so
inexplicable
its
cause
and
purpose
to
the
other
that
is
but
one
slide
remarked
gryce
now
i
will
press
another
button
and
the
color
changes
to
pink
as
you
see
this
one
produces
green
this
one
white
and
this
a
bilious
yellow
which
is
not
becoming
to
either
of
us
i
am
sure
now
will
you
examine
the
connection
and
see
if
there
is
anything
peculiar
about
it
hines
at
once
set
to
work
but
beyond
the
fact
that
the
whole
contrivance
was
the
work
of
an
amateur
hand
he
found
nothing
strange
about
it
except
the
fact
that
it
worked
so
well
gryce
showed
disappointment
he
made
it
then
himself
he
asked
undoubtedly
or
some
one
else
equally
unacquainted
with
the
latest
method
of
wiring
will
you
look
at
these
books
over
here
and
see
if
sufficient
knowledge
can
be
got
from
them
to
enable
an
amateur
to
rig
up
such
an
arrangement
as
this
hines
glanced
at
the
shelf
which
gryce
had
pointed
out
and
without
taking
out
the
books
answered
briefly
a
man
with
a
deft
hand
and
a
scientific
turn
of
mind
might
by
the
aid
of
these
do
all
you
see
here
and
more
the
aptitude
is
all
then
i
afraid
adams
had
the
aptitude
was
the
dry
response
there
was
disappointment
in
the
tone
why
his
next
words
served
to
show
a
man
with
a
turn
for
mechanical
contrivances
often
wastes
much
time
and
money
on
useless
toys
only
fit
for
children
to
play
with
look
at
that
bird
cage
now
perched
at
a
height
totally
beyond
the
reach
of
any
one
without
a
ladder
it
must
owe
its
very
evident
usefulness
for
you
see
it
holds
a
rather
lively
occupant
to
some
contrivance
by
which
it
can
be
raised
and
lowered
at
will
where
is
that
contrivance
can
you
find
it
the
expert
thought
he
could
and
sure
enough
after
some
ineffectual
searching
he
came
upon
another
button
well
hid
amid
the
tapestry
on
the
wall
which
when
pressed
caused
something
to
be
disengaged
which
gradually
lowered
the
cage
within
reach
of
gryce
hand
we
will
not
send
this
poor
bird
aloft
again
said
he
detaching
the
cage
and
holding
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hand
an
english
starling
is
none
too
common
in
this
country
hark
he
is
going
to
speak
but
the
bird
warned
perhaps
by
the
emphatic
gesture
of
the
detective
that
silence
would
be
more
in
order
at
this
moment
than
his
usual
appeal
to
remember
evelyn
whisked
about
in
his
cage
for
an
instant
and
then
subsided
into
a
doze
which
may
have
been
real
and
may
have
been
assumed
under
the
fascinating
eye
of
the
old
gentleman
who
held
him
gryce
placed
the
cage
on
the
floor
and
idly
or
because
the
play
pleased
him
old
and
staid
as
he
was
pressed
another
button
on
the
table
a
button
he
had
hitherto
neglected
touching
and
glanced
around
to
see
what
color
the
light
would
now
assume
but
the
yellow
glare
remained
the
investigation
which
the
apparatus
had
gone
through
had
probably
disarranged
the
wires
with
a
shrug
he
was
moving
off
when
he
suddenly
made
a
hurried
gesture
directing
the
attention
of
the
expert
to
a
fact
for
which
neither
of
them
was
prepared
the
opening
which
led
into
the
antechamber
and
which
was
the
sole
means
of
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
house
was
slowly
closing
from
a
yard
breadth
it
became
a
foot
from
a
foot
it
became
an
inch
from
an
inch
well
that
is
certainly
the
contrivance
of
a
lazy
man
laughed
the
expert
seated
in
his
chair
here
he
can
close
his
door
at
will
no
shouting
after
a
deaf
servant
no
awkward
stumbling
over
rugs
to
shut
it
himself
i
do
know
but
i
approve
of
this
contrivance
only
here
he
caught
a
rather
serious
expression
on
gryce
face
the
slide
seems
to
be
of
a
somewhat
curious
construction
it
is
not
made
of
wood
as
any
sensible
door
ought
to
be
but
of
steel
finished
gryce
in
an
odd
tone
this
is
the
strangest
thing
yet
it
begins
to
look
as
if
adams
was
daft
on
electrical
contrivances
and
as
if
we
were
prisoners
here
supplemented
the
other
i
do
not
see
any
means
for
drawing
this
slide
back
oh
there
another
button
for
that
of
course
gryce
carelessly
remarked
but
they
failed
to
find
one
if
you
do
object
observed
gryce
after
five
minutes
of
useless
search
i
will
turn
a
more
cheerful
light
upon
the
scene
yellow
does
not
seem
to
fit
the
occasion
give
us
rose
for
unless
you
have
some
one
on
the
other
side
of
this
steel
plate
we
seem
likely
to
remain
here
till
morning
there
is
a
man
upstairs
whom
we
may
perhaps
make
hear
but
what
does
this
contrivance
portend
it
has
a
serious
look
to
me
when
you
consider
that
every
window
in
these
two
rooms
has
been
built
up
almost
under
the
roof
yes
a
very
strange
look
but
before
engaging
in
its
consideration
i
should
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
i
can
not
do
anything
while
in
confinement
my
brain
wo
work
meanwhile
gryce
was
engaged
in
examining
the
huge
plate
of
steel
which
served
as
a
barrier
to
their
egress
he
found
that
it
had
been
made
certainly
at
great
expense
to
fit
the
curve
of
the
walls
through
which
it
passed
this
was
a
discovery
of
some
consequence
causing
gryce
to
grow
still
more
thoughtful
and
to
eye
the
smooth
steel
plate
under
his
hand
with
an
air
of
marked
distrust
adams
carried
his
taste
for
the
mechanical
to
great
extremes
he
remarked
to
the
slightly
uneasy
man
beside
him
this
slide
is
very
carefully
fitted
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
will
stand
some
battering
before
we
are
released
i
wish
that
his
interest
in
electricity
had
led
him
to
attach
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
bell
true
we
have
come
across
no
bell
it
would
have
smacked
too
much
of
the
ordinary
to
please
him
besides
his
only
servant
was
deaf
try
the
effect
of
a
blow
a
quick
blow
with
this
alpenstock
some
one
should
hear
and
come
to
our
assistance
i
will
try
my
whistle
first
it
will
be
better
understood
but
though
gryce
both
whistled
and
struck
many
a
resounding
knock
upon
the
barrier
before
them
it
was
an
hour
before
he
could
draw
the
attention
of
styles
and
five
hours
before
an
opening
could
be
effected
in
the
wall
large
enough
to
admit
of
their
escape
so
firmly
was
this
barrier
of
steel
fixed
across
the
sole
outlet
from
this
remarkable
room
chapter
five
small
spangles
such
an
experience
could
not
fail
to
emphasize
gryce
interest
in
the
case
and
heighten
the
determination
he
had
formed
to
probe
its
secrets
and
explain
all
its
extraordinary
features
arrived
at
headquarters
where
his
presence
was
doubtless
awaited
with
some
anxiety
by
those
who
knew
nothing
of
the
cause
of
his
long
detention
his
first
act
was
to
inquire
if
bartow
the
butler
had
come
to
his
senses
during
the
night
the
answer
was
disappointing
not
only
was
there
no
change
in
his
condition
but
the
expert
in
lunacy
who
had
been
called
in
to
pass
upon
his
case
had
expressed
an
opinion
unfavorable
to
his
immediate
recovery
gryce
looked
sober
and
summoning
the
officer
who
had
managed
bartow
arrest
he
asked
how
the
mute
had
acted
when
he
found
himself
detained
the
answer
was
curt
but
very
much
to
the
point
surprised
sir
shook
his
head
and
made
some
queer
gestures
then
went
through
his
pantomime
it
quite
a
spectacle
sir
poor
fool
he
keeps
holding
his
hand
back
so
gryce
noted
the
gesture
it
was
the
same
which
bartow
had
made
when
he
first
realized
that
he
had
spectators
its
meaning
was
not
wholly
apparent
he
had
made
it
with
his
right
hand
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
mute
was
and
he
continued
to
make
it
as
if
with
this
movement
he
expected
to
call
attention
to
some
fact
that
would
relieve
him
from
custody
does
he
mope
is
his
expression
one
of
fear
or
anger
it
varies
sir
one
minute
he
looks
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
falling
asleep
the
next
he
starts
up
in
fury
shaking
his
head
and
pounding
the
walls
it
not
a
comfortable
sight
sir
he
will
have
to
be
watched
night
and
day
let
him
be
and
note
every
change
in
him
his
testimony
may
not
be
valid
but
there
is
suggestion
in
every
movement
he
makes
i
will
visit
him
myself
the
officer
went
out
and
gryce
sat
for
a
few
moments
communing
with
himself
during
which
he
took
out
a
little
package
from
his
pocket
and
emptying
out
on
his
desk
the
five
little
spangles
it
contained
regarded
them
intently
he
had
always
been
fond
of
looking
at
some
small
and
seemingly
insignificant
object
while
thinking
it
served
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
no
doubt
at
all
events
some
such
result
appeared
to
follow
the
contemplation
of
these
five
sequins
for
after
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
over
them
for
a
time
he
made
a
sudden
move
and
sweeping
them
into
the
envelope
from
which
he
had
taken
them
he
gave
a
glance
at
his
watch
and
passed
quickly
into
the
outer
office
where
he
paused
before
a
line
of
waiting
men
beckoning
to
one
who
had
followed
his
movements
with
an
interest
which
had
not
escaped
the
eye
of
this
old
reader
of
human
nature
he
led
the
way
back
to
his
own
room
you
want
a
hand
in
this
matter
he
said
interrogatively
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
they
found
themselves
alone
oh
sir
began
the
young
man
in
a
glow
which
made
his
more
than
plain
features
interesting
to
contemplate
i
do
not
presume
enough
interposed
the
other
you
have
been
here
now
for
six
months
and
have
had
no
opportunity
as
yet
for
showing
any
special
adaptability
now
i
propose
to
test
your
powers
with
something
really
difficult
are
you
up
to
it
sweetwater
do
you
know
the
city
well
enough
to
attempt
to
find
a
needle
in
this
very
big
haystack
i
should
at
least
like
to
try
was
the
eager
response
if
i
succeed
it
will
be
a
bigger
feather
in
my
cap
than
if
i
had
always
lived
in
new
york
i
have
been
spoiling
for
some
such
opportunity
see
if
i
make
the
effort
judiciously
if
only
out
of
gratitude
well
we
shall
see
remarked
the
old
detective
if
it
difficulty
you
long
to
encounter
you
will
be
likely
to
have
all
you
want
of
it
indeed
it
is
the
impossible
i
ask
a
woman
is
to
be
found
of
whom
we
know
nothing
save
that
she
wore
when
last
seen
a
dress
heavily
bespangled
with
black
and
that
she
carried
in
her
visit
to
adams
at
the
time
of
or
before
the
murder
a
parasol
of
which
i
can
procure
you
a
glimpse
before
you
start
out
she
came
from
i
do
know
where
and
she
went
but
that
is
what
you
are
to
find
out
you
are
not
the
only
man
who
is
to
be
put
on
the
job
which
as
you
see
is
next
door
to
a
hopeless
one
unless
the
woman
comes
forward
and
proclaims
herself
indeed
i
should
despair
utterly
of
your
success
if
it
were
not
for
one
small
fact
which
i
will
now
proceed
to
give
you
as
my
special
and
confidential
agent
in
this
matter
when
this
woman
was
about
to
disappear
from
the
one
eye
that
was
watching
her
she
approached
the
curbstone
in
front
of
hudson
fruit
store
on
street
and
lifted
up
her
right
hand
so
it
is
not
much
of
a
clew
but
it
is
all
i
have
at
my
disposal
except
these
five
spangles
dropped
from
her
dress
and
my
conviction
that
she
is
not
to
be
found
among
the
questionable
women
of
the
town
but
among
those
who
seldom
or
never
come
under
the
eye
of
the
police
yet
do
let
this
conviction
hamper
you
convictions
as
a
rule
are
bad
things
and
act
as
a
hindrance
rather
than
an
inspiration
sweetwater
to
whom
the
song
of
the
sirens
would
have
sounded
less
sweet
listened
with
delight
and
responded
with
a
frank
smile
and
a
gay
i
do
my
best
sir
but
do
show
me
the
parasol
only
describe
it
i
would
like
the
fellows
to
chaff
me
if
i
fail
i
rather
go
quietly
to
work
and
raise
no
foolish
expectations
well
then
it
is
one
of
those
dainty
nonsensical
things
made
of
gray
chiffon
with
pearl
handle
and
bows
of
pink
ribbon
i
do
believe
it
was
ever
used
before
and
from
the
value
women
usually
place
on
such
could
only
have
been
left
behind
under
the
stress
of
extraordinary
emotion
or
fear
the
name
of
the
owner
was
not
on
it
nor
that
of
the
maker
gryce
had
expected
this
question
and
was
glad
not
to
be
disappointed
no
that
would
have
helped
us
too
much
and
the
hour
at
which
this
lady
was
seen
on
the
curbstone
at
hudson
four
the
moment
at
which
the
telephone
message
arrived
very
good
sir
it
is
the
hardest
task
i
have
ever
undertaken
but
that
not
against
it
when
shall
i
see
you
again
when
you
have
something
to
impart
ah
wait
a
minute
i
have
my
suspicion
that
this
woman
first
name
is
evelyn
but
mind
it
is
only
a
suspicion
all
right
sir
and
with
an
air
of
some
confidence
the
young
man
disappeared
gryce
did
not
look
as
if
he
shared
young
sweetwater
cheerfulness
the
mist
surrounding
this
affair
was
as
yet
impenetrable
to
him
but
then
he
was
not
with
only
triumphant
memories
behind
him
his
next
hope
lay
in
the
information
likely
to
accrue
from
the
published
accounts
of
this
crime
now
spread
broadcast
over
the
country
a
man
of
adams
wealth
and
culture
must
necessarily
have
possessed
many
acquaintances
whom
the
surprising
news
of
his
sudden
death
would
naturally
bring
to
light
especially
as
no
secret
was
made
of
his
means
and
many
valuable
effects
but
as
if
this
affair
destined
to
be
one
of
the
last
to
engage
the
powers
of
this
sagacious
old
man
refused
on
this
very
account
to
yield
any
immediate
results
to
his
investigation
the
whole
day
passed
by
without
the
appearance
of
any
claimant
for
adams
fortune
or
the
arrival
on
the
scene
of
any
friend
capable
of
lifting
the
veil
which
shrouded
the
life
of
this
strange
being
to
be
sure
his
banker
and
his
lawyer
came
forward
during
the
day
but
they
had
little
to
reveal
beyond
the
fact
that
his
pecuniary
affairs
were
in
good
shape
and
that
so
far
as
they
knew
he
was
without
family
or
kin
even
his
landlord
could
add
little
to
the
general
knowledge
he
had
first
heard
of
adams
through
a
philadelphia
lawyer
since
dead
who
had
assured
him
of
his
client
respectability
and
undoubted
ability
to
pay
his
rent
when
they
came
together
and
adams
was
introduced
to
him
he
had
been
struck
first
by
the
ascetic
appearance
of
his
prospective
tenant
and
secondly
by
his
reserved
manners
and
quiet
intelligence
but
admirable
as
he
had
found
him
he
had
never
succeeded
in
making
his
acquaintance
the
rent
had
been
uniformly
paid
with
great
exactitude
on
the
very
day
it
was
due
but
his
own
visits
had
never
been
encouraged
or
his
advances
met
by
anything
but
the
cold
politeness
of
a
polished
and
totally
indifferent
man
indeed
he
had
always
looked
upon
his
tenant
as
a
bookworm
absorbed
in
study
and
such
scientific
experiments
as
could
be
carried
on
with
no
other
assistance
than
that
of
his
deaf
and
dumb
servant
asked
if
he
knew
anything
about
this
servant
he
answered
that
his
acquaintance
with
him
was
limited
to
the
two
occasions
on
which
he
had
been
ushered
by
him
into
his
master
presence
that
he
knew
nothing
of
his
character
and
general
disposition
and
could
not
say
whether
his
attitude
toward
his
master
had
been
one
of
allegiance
or
antagonism
and
so
the
way
was
blocked
in
this
direction
taken
into
the
room
where
adams
had
died
he
surveyed
in
amazement
the
huge
steel
plate
which
still
blocked
the
doorway
and
the
high
windows
through
which
only
a
few
straggling
sunbeams
could
find
their
way
pointing
to
the
windows
he
remarked
these
were
filled
in
at
adams
request
originally
they
extended
down
to
the
wainscoting
he
was
shown
where
lath
and
plaster
had
been
introduced
and
also
how
the
plate
had
been
prepared
and
arranged
as
a
barrier
but
he
could
give
no
explanation
of
it
or
divine
the
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
placed
there
at
so
great
an
expense
the
lamp
was
another
curiosity
and
its
varying
lights
the
cause
of
increased
astonishment
indeed
he
had
known
nothing
of
these
arrangements
having
been
received
in
the
parlor
when
he
visited
the
house
where
there
was
nothing
to
attract
his
attention
or
emphasize
the
oddities
of
his
tenant
he
was
not
shown
the
starling
that
loquacious
bird
had
been
removed
to
police
headquarters
for
the
special
delectation
of
gryce
other
inquiries
failed
also
no
clew
to
the
owner
of
the
insignia
found
on
the
wall
could
be
gained
at
the
pension
office
or
at
any
of
the
posts
inside
the
city
nor
was
the
name
of
the
artist
who
had
painted
the
portrait
which
adorned
so
large
a
portion
of
the
wall
a
recognized
one
in
new
york
city
otherwise
a
clew
might
have
been
obtained
through
him
to
adams
antecedents
all
the
drawers
and
receptacles
in
adams
study
had
been
searched
but
no
will
had
been
found
nor
any
business
documents
it
was
as
if
this
strange
man
had
sought
to
suppress
his
identity
or
rather
as
if
he
had
outgrown
all
interest
in
his
kind
or
in
anything
beyond
the
walls
within
which
he
had
immured
himself
late
in
the
afternoon
reports
began
to
come
in
from
the
various
tradesmen
with
whom
adams
had
done
business
they
all
had
something
to
say
as
to
the
peculiarity
of
his
habits
and
the
freaks
of
his
mute
servant
they
were
both
described
as
hermits
differing
from
the
rest
of
their
kind
only
in
that
they
denied
themselves
no
reasonable
luxury
and
seemed
to
have
adopted
a
life
from
a
pure
love
of
seclusion
the
master
was
never
seen
at
the
stores
it
was
the
servant
who
made
the
purchases
and
this
by
means
of
gestures
which
were
often
strangely
significant
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
great
power
of
expressing
himself
by
looks
and
actions
and
rarely
caused
a
mistake
or
made
one
he
would
not
endure
cheating
and
always
bought
the
best
of
his
sanity
up
to
the
day
of
his
master
death
there
was
no
question
but
more
than
one
man
with
whom
he
had
had
dealings
was
ready
to
testify
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
his
manner
for
the
past
few
weeks
a
sort
of
subdued
excitement
quite
unlike
his
former
methodical
bearing
he
had
shown
an
inclination
to
testiness
and
was
less
easily
pleased
than
formerly
to
one
clerk
he
had
shown
a
nasty
spirit
under
very
slight
provocation
and
was
only
endured
in
the
store
on
account
of
his
master
who
was
too
good
a
customer
for
them
to
offend
kelly
a
grocer
went
so
far
as
to
say
he
acted
like
a
man
with
a
grievance
who
burned
to
vent
his
spite
on
some
one
but
held
himself
in
forcible
restraint
perhaps
if
no
tragedy
had
taken
place
in
the
house
on
street
these
various
persons
would
not
have
been
so
ready
to
interpret
thus
unfavorably
a
nervousness
excusable
enough
in
one
so
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
his
kind
but
with
the
violent
end
of
his
master
in
view
and
his
own
unexplained
connection
with
it
who
could
help
recalling
that
his
glance
had
frequently
shown
malevolence
but
this
was
not
evidence
of
the
decided
character
required
by
the
law
and
gryce
was
about
to
regard
the
day
as
a
lost
one
when
sweetwater
made
his
reappearance
at
headquarters
the
expression
of
his
face
put
new
life
into
gryce
what
he
cried
you
have
not
found
her
sweetwater
smiled
do
ask
me
sir
not
yet
i
come
to
see
if
there
any
reason
why
i
should
not
be
given
the
loan
of
that
parasol
for
about
an
hour
i
bring
it
back
i
only
want
to
make
a
certain
test
with
it
what
test
my
boy
may
i
ask
what
test
please
to
excuse
me
sir
i
have
only
a
short
time
in
which
to
act
before
respectable
business
houses
shut
up
for
the
night
and
the
test
i
speak
of
has
to
be
made
in
a
respectable
house
then
you
shall
not
be
hindered
wait
here
and
i
will
bring
you
the
parasol
there
bring
it
back
soon
my
boy
i
have
not
the
patience
i
used
to
have
an
hour
sir
give
me
an
hour
and
then
the
shutting
of
the
door
behind
his
flying
figure
cut
short
his
sentence
that
was
a
long
hour
to
gryce
or
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
mercifully
been
cut
short
by
the
return
of
sweetwater
in
an
even
more
excited
state
of
mind
than
he
had
been
before
he
held
the
parasol
in
his
hand
my
test
failed
said
he
but
the
parasol
has
brought
me
luck
notwithstanding
i
have
found
the
lady
sir
and
he
had
to
draw
a
long
breath
before
proceeding
and
she
is
what
i
said
began
the
detective
a
respectable
person
in
a
respectable
house
yes
sir
very
respectable
more
respectable
than
i
expected
to
see
quite
a
lady
sir
not
young
but
her
name
boy
is
it
evelyn
sweetwater
shook
his
head
with
a
look
as
naive
in
its
way
as
the
old
detective
question
i
can
not
say
sir
indeed
i
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
she
is
here
here
gryce
took
one
hurried
step
toward
the
door
then
came
gravely
back
i
can
restrain
myself
he
said
if
she
is
here
she
will
not
go
till
i
have
seen
her
are
you
sure
you
have
made
no
mistake
that
she
is
the
woman
we
are
after
the
woman
who
was
in
house
and
sent
us
the
warning
will
you
hear
my
story
sir
it
will
take
only
a
moment
then
you
can
judge
for
yourself
your
story
it
must
be
a
pretty
one
how
came
you
to
light
on
this
woman
so
soon
by
using
the
clew
i
gave
you
again
sweetwater
expression
took
on
a
touch
of
naïveté
i
sorry
sir
but
i
was
egotistical
enough
to
follow
my
own
idea
it
would
have
taken
too
much
time
to
hunt
up
all
the
drivers
of
hacks
in
the
city
and
i
could
not
even
be
sure
she
had
made
use
of
a
public
conveyance
no
sir
i
bethought
me
of
another
way
by
which
i
might
reach
this
woman
you
had
shown
me
those
spangles
they
were
portions
of
a
very
rich
trimming
a
trimming
which
has
only
lately
come
into
vogue
and
which
is
so
expensive
that
it
is
worn
chiefly
by
women
of
means
and
sold
only
in
shops
where
elaborate
garnitures
are
to
be
found
i
have
seen
and
noticed
dresses
thus
trimmed
in
certain
windows
and
on
certain
ladies
and
before
you
showed
me
the
spangles
you
picked
up
in
adams
study
could
have
told
you
just
how
i
had
seen
them
arranged
they
are
sewed
on
black
net
in
figures
sir
in
scrolls
or
wreaths
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
them
and
so
conspicuous
are
these
wreaths
or
figures
owing
to
the
brilliance
of
the
spangles
composing
them
that
any
break
in
their
continuity
is
plainly
apparent
especially
if
the
net
be
worn
over
a
color
as
is
frequently
the
case
remembering
this
and
recalling
the
fact
that
these
spangles
doubtless
fell
from
one
of
the
front
breadths
where
their
loss
would
attract
not
only
the
attention
of
others
but
that
of
the
wearer
i
said
to
myself
will
she
be
likely
to
do
when
she
finds
her
dress
thus
disfigured
and
the
answer
at
once
came
she
is
the
lady
gryce
considers
her
she
will
seek
to
restore
these
missing
spangles
especially
if
they
were
lost
on
a
scene
of
crime
but
where
can
she
get
them
to
sew
on
from
an
extra
piece
of
net
of
the
same
style
but
she
will
not
be
apt
to
have
an
extra
piece
of
net
she
will
therefore
find
herself
obliged
to
buy
it
and
since
only
a
few
spangles
are
lacking
she
will
buy
the
veriest
strip
here
then
was
my
clew
or
at
least
my
ground
for
action
going
the
rounds
of
the
few
leading
stores
on
broadway
street
and
sixth
avenue
i
succeeded
in
getting
certain
clerks
interested
in
my
efforts
so
that
i
speedily
became
assured
that
if
a
lady
came
into
these
stores
for
a
very
small
portion
of
this
bespangled
net
they
would
note
her
person
and
if
possible
procure
some
clew
to
her
address
then
i
took
up
my
stand
at
arnold
emporium
why
arnold
i
do
not
know
perhaps
my
good
genius
meant
me
to
be
successful
in
this
quest
but
whether
through
luck
or
what
not
i
was
successful
for
before
the
afternoon
was
half
over
i
encountered
a
meaning
glance
from
one
of
the
men
behind
the
counter
and
advancing
toward
him
saw
him
rolling
a
small
package
which
he
handed
over
to
a
very
pretty
and
rosy
young
girl
who
at
once
walked
away
with
it
one
of
our
leading
customers
he
whispered
as
i
drew
nearer
do
think
she
is
the
person
you
want
but
i
would
take
no
chances
i
followed
the
young
girl
who
had
carried
away
the
parcel
and
by
this
means
came
to
a
fine
brownstone
front
in
one
of
our
most
retired
and
aristocratic
quarters
when
i
had
seen
her
go
in
at
the
basement
door
i
rang
the
bell
above
and
then
well
i
just
bit
my
lips
to
keep
down
my
growing
excitement
for
such
an
effort
as
this
might
well
end
in
disappointment
and
i
knew
if
i
were
disappointed
now
but
no
such
trial
awaited
me
the
maid
who
came
to
the
door
proved
to
be
the
same
lass
i
had
seen
leave
the
store
indeed
she
had
the
identical
parcel
in
her
hand
which
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
imposing
house
at
whose
door
i
stood
and
the
strange
murder
in
street
but
i
did
not
allow
my
interest
in
this
parcel
to
become
apparent
and
by
the
time
i
addressed
her
i
had
so
mastered
myself
as
to
arouse
no
suspicion
of
the
importance
of
my
errand
you
of
course
foresee
the
question
i
put
to
the
young
girl
your
mistress
lost
a
parasol
one
has
been
found
i
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
i
perceived
by
her
look
that
her
mistress
had
met
with
such
a
loss
and
as
this
was
all
i
wanted
to
know
just
then
i
cried
out
will
bring
it
if
it
is
hers
all
right
and
bounded
down
the
steps
my
intention
was
to
inform
you
of
what
i
had
done
and
ask
your
advice
but
my
egotism
got
the
better
of
me
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
make
sure
that
i
was
not
the
victim
of
a
coincidence
such
a
respectable
house
such
a
respectable
maidservant
should
she
recognize
the
parasol
as
belonging
to
her
mistress
then
indeed
i
might
boast
of
my
success
so
praying
you
for
a
loan
of
this
article
i
went
back
and
rang
the
bell
again
the
same
girl
came
to
the
door
i
think
fortune
favored
me
is
the
parasol
said
i
but
before
the
words
were
out
of
my
mouth
i
saw
that
the
girl
had
taken
the
alarm
or
that
some
grievous
mistake
had
been
made
is
not
the
one
my
mistress
lost
said
she
never
carries
anything
but
black
and
the
door
was
about
to
close
between
us
when
i
heard
a
voice
from
within
call
out
peremptorily
me
see
that
parasol
hold
it
up
young
man
there
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
ah
if
ever
an
exclamation
was
eloquent
that
simple
was
i
could
not
see
the
speaker
but
i
knew
she
was
leaning
over
the
banisters
from
the
landing
above
i
listened
to
hear
her
glide
away
but
she
did
not
move
she
was
evidently
collecting
herself
for
the
emergency
of
the
moment
presently
she
spoke
again
and
i
was
astonished
at
her
tone
have
come
from
police
headquarters
was
the
remark
with
which
she
hailed
me
i
lowered
the
parasol
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
say
yes
a
man
there
called
gryce
she
went
on
still
in
that
strange
tone
i
can
hardly
describe
sir
you
ask
me
i
now
replied
acknowledge
that
it
is
through
his
instructions
i
am
here
he
was
anxious
to
restore
to
you
your
lost
property
is
not
this
parasol
yours
shall
i
not
leave
it
with
this
young
girl
the
answer
was
dry
almost
rasping
gryce
has
made
a
mistake
the
parasol
is
not
mine
yet
he
certainly
deserves
credit
for
the
use
he
has
made
of
it
in
this
search
i
should
like
to
tell
him
so
is
he
at
his
office
and
do
you
think
i
would
be
received
would
be
delighted
i
returned
not
imagining
she
was
in
earnest
but
she
was
sir
in
less
time
than
you
would
believe
i
perceived
a
very
stately
almost
severe
lady
descend
the
stairs
she
was
dressed
for
the
street
and
spoke
to
me
with
quite
an
air
of
command
you
a
cab
she
asked
said
i
get
one
here
was
a
dilemma
should
i
leave
her
and
thus
give
her
an
opportunity
to
escape
or
should
i
trust
to
her
integrity
and
the
honesty
of
her
look
which
was
no
common
one
sir
and
obey
her
as
every
one
about
her
was
evidently
accustomed
to
do
i
concluded
to
trust
to
her
integrity
and
went
for
the
cab
but
it
was
a
risk
sir
which
i
promise
not
to
repeat
in
the
future
she
was
awaiting
me
on
the
stoop
when
i
got
back
and
at
once
entered
the
hack
with
a
command
to
drive
immediately
to
police
headquarters
i
saw
her
as
i
came
in
just
now
sitting
in
the
outer
office
waiting
for
you
are
you
ready
to
say
i
have
done
well
gryce
with
an
indescribable
look
of
mingled
envy
and
indulgence
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
him
and
passed
out
his
curiosity
could
be
restrained
no
longer
and
he
went
at
once
to
where
this
mysterious
woman
was
awaiting
him
did
he
think
it
odd
that
she
knew
him
that
she
sought
him
if
so
he
did
not
betray
this
in
his
manner
which
was
one
of
great
respect
but
that
manner
suddenly
changed
as
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
lady
in
question
not
that
it
lost
its
respect
but
that
it
betrayed
an
astonishment
of
a
more
pronounced
character
than
was
usually
indulged
in
by
this
experienced
detective
the
lady
before
him
was
one
well
known
to
him
in
fact
almost
an
associate
of
his
in
certain
bygone
matters
in
other
words
none
other
than
that
most
reputable
of
ladies
miss
amelia
butterworth
of
gramercy
park
chapter
vi
suggestions
from
an
old
friend
the
look
with
which
this
amiable
spinster
met
his
eye
was
one
which
a
stranger
would
have
found
it
hard
to
understand
he
found
it
hard
to
understand
himself
perhaps
because
he
had
never
before
seen
this
lady
when
she
was
laboring
under
an
opinion
of
herself
that
was
not
one
of
perfect
complacency
miss
butterworth
what
does
this
mean
have
you
there
the
word
came
with
some
sharpness
you
have
detected
me
at
my
old
tricks
and
i
am
correspondingly
ashamed
and
you
triumphant
the
gray
parasol
you
have
been
good
enough
to
send
to
my
house
is
not
mine
but
i
was
in
the
room
where
you
picked
it
up
as
you
have
so
cleverly
concluded
and
as
it
is
useless
for
me
to
evade
your
perspicacity
i
have
come
here
to
confess
ah
the
detective
was
profoundly
interested
at
once
he
drew
a
chair
up
to
miss
butterworth
side
and
sat
down
you
were
there
he
repeated
and
when
i
do
not
presume
to
ask
for
what
purpose
but
i
shall
have
to
explain
my
purpose
not
to
find
myself
at
too
great
a
disadvantage
she
replied
with
grim
decision
not
that
i
like
to
display
my
own
weakness
but
that
i
recognize
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
and
fully
appreciate
your
surprise
at
finding
that
i
a
stranger
to
adams
and
without
the
excuse
which
led
to
my
former
interference
in
police
matters
should
have
so
far
forgotten
myself
as
to
be
in
my
present
position
before
you
this
was
no
affair
of
my
immediate
neighbor
nor
did
it
seek
me
i
sought
it
sir
and
in
this
way
i
wish
i
had
gone
to
jericho
first
it
might
have
meant
longer
travel
and
much
more
expense
but
it
would
have
involved
me
in
less
humiliation
and
possible
publicity
gryce
i
never
meant
to
be
mixed
up
with
another
murder
case
i
have
shown
my
aptitude
for
detective
work
and
received
ere
now
certain
marks
of
your
approval
but
my
head
was
not
turned
by
them
at
least
i
thought
not
and
i
was
tolerably
sincere
in
my
determination
to
keep
to
my
own
in
future
and
not
suffer
myself
to
be
allured
by
any
inducements
you
might
offer
into
the
exercise
of
gifts
which
may
have
brought
me
praise
in
the
past
but
certainly
have
not
brought
me
happiness
but
the
temptation
came
not
through
you
or
i
might
have
resisted
it
but
through
a
combination
of
circumstances
which
found
me
weak
and
in
a
measure
unprepared
in
other
words
i
was
surprised
into
taking
an
interest
in
this
affair
oh
i
am
ashamed
of
it
so
ashamed
that
i
have
made
the
greatest
endeavor
to
hide
my
participation
in
the
matter
and
thinking
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
was
congratulating
myself
upon
my
precautions
when
i
found
that
parasol
thrust
in
my
face
and
realized
that
you
if
no
one
else
knew
that
amelia
butterworth
had
been
in
adams
room
of
death
prior
to
yourself
yet
i
thought
i
had
left
no
traces
behind
me
could
you
have
seen
miss
butterworth
you
dropped
five
small
spangles
from
your
robe
you
wore
a
dress
spangled
with
black
sequins
did
you
not
besides
you
moved
the
inkstand
and
well
i
will
never
put
faith
in
circumstantial
evidence
again
i
saw
these
tokens
of
a
woman
presence
heard
what
the
boy
had
to
say
of
the
lady
who
had
sent
him
into
the
with
a
message
to
the
police
and
drew
the
conclusion
i
may
admit
it
to
you
that
it
was
this
woman
who
had
wielded
the
dagger
and
not
the
butler
who
until
now
has
borne
the
blame
of
it
therefore
i
was
anxious
to
find
her
little
realizing
what
would
be
the
result
of
my
efforts
or
that
i
should
have
to
proffer
her
my
most
humble
apologies
do
not
apologize
to
me
i
had
no
business
to
be
there
or
at
least
to
leave
the
five
spangles
you
speak
of
behind
me
on
adams
miserable
floor
i
was
simply
passing
by
the
house
and
had
i
been
the
woman
i
once
was
that
is
a
woman
who
had
never
dipped
into
a
mystery
i
should
have
continued
on
my
way
instead
of
turning
aside
sir
it
a
curious
sensation
to
find
yourself
however
innocent
regarded
by
a
whole
city
full
of
people
as
the
cause
or
motive
of
a
terrible
murder
especially
when
you
have
spent
some
time
as
i
have
in
the
study
of
crime
and
the
pursuit
of
criminals
i
own
i
do
enjoy
the
experience
but
i
have
brought
it
on
myself
if
i
had
not
been
so
curious
but
it
was
not
curiosity
i
felt
i
will
never
own
that
i
am
subject
to
mere
curiosity
it
was
the
look
on
the
young
man
face
but
i
forget
myself
i
am
rambling
in
all
directions
when
i
ought
to
be
telling
a
consecutive
tale
not
my
usual
habit
sir
this
you
know
but
i
am
not
quite
myself
at
this
moment
i
declare
i
am
more
upset
by
this
discovery
of
my
indiscretion
than
i
was
by
trohm
declaration
of
affection
in
lost
man
lane
give
me
time
gryce
in
a
few
minutes
i
will
be
more
coherent
i
am
giving
you
time
he
returned
with
one
of
his
lowest
bows
the
questions
i
long
to
ask
have
not
yet
left
my
lips
and
i
sit
here
as
you
must
yourself
acknowledge
a
monument
of
patience
so
you
thought
this
deed
perpetrated
by
an
outsider
she
suddenly
broke
in
most
of
the
journals
i
read
them
very
carefully
this
morning
ascribed
the
crime
to
the
man
you
have
mentioned
and
there
seems
to
be
good
reason
for
doing
so
the
case
is
not
a
simple
one
gryce
it
has
complications
i
recognized
that
at
once
and
that
is
why
but
i
wo
waste
another
moment
in
apologies
you
have
a
right
to
any
little
fact
i
may
have
picked
up
in
my
unfortunate
visit
and
there
is
one
which
i
failed
to
find
included
in
any
account
of
the
murder
adams
had
other
visitors
besides
myself
in
those
few
fatal
minutes
preceding
his
death
a
young
man
and
woman
were
with
him
i
saw
them
come
out
of
the
house
it
was
at
the
moment
i
was
passing
tell
your
story
more
simply
miss
butterworth
what
first
drew
your
attention
to
the
house
there
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
had
to
remind
me
to
be
more
direct
you
will
not
have
to
do
so
again
gryce
to
begin
then
i
noticed
the
house
because
i
always
notice
it
i
never
pass
it
without
giving
a
thought
to
its
ancient
history
and
indulging
in
more
or
less
speculation
as
to
its
present
inmates
when
therefore
i
found
myself
in
front
of
it
yesterday
afternoon
on
my
way
to
the
art
exhibition
i
naturally
looked
up
and
whether
by
an
act
of
providence
or
not
i
can
not
say
it
was
precisely
at
that
instant
the
inner
door
of
the
vestibule
burst
open
and
a
young
man
appeared
in
the
hall
carrying
a
young
woman
in
his
arms
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
and
she
in
a
dead
faint
but
before
they
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
crowd
he
had
placed
her
on
her
feet
and
taking
her
on
his
arm
dragged
her
down
the
stoop
and
into
the
crowd
of
among
whom
they
presently
disappeared
i
as
you
may
believe
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
in
my
astonishment
and
not
only
endeavored
to
see
in
what
direction
they
went
but
lingered
long
enough
to
take
a
peep
into
the
interior
of
this
old
house
which
had
been
left
open
to
view
by
the
young
man
forgetting
to
close
the
front
door
behind
him
as
i
did
so
i
heard
a
cry
from
within
it
was
muffled
and
remote
but
unmistakably
one
of
terror
and
anguish
and
led
by
an
impulse
i
may
live
to
regret
as
it
seems
likely
to
plunge
me
into
much
unpleasantness
i
rushed
up
the
stoop
and
went
in
shutting
the
door
behind
me
lest
others
should
be
induced
to
follow
so
far
i
had
acted
solely
from
instinct
but
once
in
that
hall
i
paused
and
asked
what
business
i
had
there
and
what
excuse
i
should
give
for
my
intrusion
if
i
encountered
one
or
more
of
the
occupants
of
the
house
but
a
repetition
of
the
cry
coming
as
i
am
ready
to
swear
from
the
farthest
room
on
the
parlor
floor
together
with
a
sharp
remembrance
of
the
wandering
eye
and
drawn
countenance
of
the
young
man
whom
i
had
seen
stagger
hence
a
moment
before
with
an
almost
fainting
woman
in
his
arms
drew
me
on
in
spite
of
my
feminine
instincts
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
in
the
circular
study
and
before
the
prostrate
form
of
a
seemingly
dying
man
he
was
lying
as
you
probably
found
him
a
little
later
with
the
cross
on
his
breast
and
a
dagger
in
his
heart
but
his
right
hand
was
trembling
and
when
i
stooped
to
lift
his
head
he
gave
a
shudder
and
then
settled
into
eternal
stillness
i
a
stranger
from
the
street
had
witnessed
his
last
breath
while
the
young
man
who
had
gone
out
can
you
describe
him
did
you
encounter
him
close
enough
for
recognition
yes
i
think
i
would
know
him
again
i
can
at
least
describe
his
appearance
he
wore
a
checked
suit
very
natty
and
was
more
than
usually
tall
and
but
his
chief
peculiarity
lay
in
his
expression
i
never
saw
on
any
face
no
not
on
the
stage
at
the
climax
of
the
most
tragedy
a
greater
accumulation
of
mortal
passion
struggling
with
the
imperative
necessity
for
restraint
the
young
girl
whose
blond
head
lay
on
his
shoulder
looked
like
a
saint
in
the
clutch
of
a
demon
she
had
seen
death
but
he
but
i
prefer
not
to
be
the
interpreter
of
that
expressive
countenance
it
was
lost
to
my
view
almost
immediately
and
probably
calmed
itself
in
the
face
of
the
throng
he
entered
or
we
would
be
hearing
about
him
the
girl
seemed
to
be
devoid
of
almost
all
feeling
i
should
not
remember
her
and
was
that
all
did
you
just
look
at
that
recumbent
man
and
vanish
did
you
encounter
the
butler
have
you
some
definite
knowledge
to
impart
in
his
regard
which
will
settle
his
innocence
or
fix
his
guilt
i
know
no
more
about
him
than
you
do
sir
except
that
he
was
not
in
the
room
by
the
time
i
reached
it
and
did
not
come
into
it
during
my
presence
there
yet
it
was
his
cry
that
led
me
to
the
spot
or
do
you
think
it
was
that
of
the
bird
i
afterward
heard
shouting
and
screaming
in
the
cage
over
the
dead
man
head
it
might
have
been
the
bird
admitted
gryce
its
call
is
very
clear
and
it
seems
strangely
intelligent
what
was
it
saying
while
you
stood
there
something
about
eva
eva
maddening
eva
i
love
eva
eva
eva
eva
was
it
poor
evelyn
no
it
was
eva
i
thought
he
might
mean
the
girl
i
had
just
seen
carried
out
it
was
an
unpleasant
experience
hearing
this
bird
shriek
out
these
cries
in
the
face
of
the
man
lying
dead
at
my
feet
miss
butterworth
you
did
simply
stand
over
that
man
you
knelt
down
and
looked
in
his
face
i
acknowledge
it
and
caught
my
dress
in
the
filagree
of
the
cross
naturally
i
would
not
stand
stock
still
with
a
man
drawing
his
last
breath
under
my
eye
and
what
else
did
you
do
you
went
to
the
table
yes
i
went
to
the
table
and
moved
the
inkstand
yes
i
moved
the
inkstand
but
very
carefully
sir
very
carefully
not
so
carefully
but
that
i
could
see
where
it
had
been
sitting
before
you
took
it
up
the
square
made
by
its
base
in
the
dust
of
the
table
did
not
coincide
with
the
place
afterwards
occupied
by
it
ah
that
comes
from
your
having
on
your
glasses
and
i
not
i
endeavored
to
set
it
down
in
the
precise
place
from
which
i
lifted
it
why
did
you
take
it
up
at
all
what
were
you
looking
for
for
clews
gryce
you
must
forgive
me
but
i
was
seeking
for
clews
i
moved
several
things
i
was
hunting
for
the
line
of
writing
which
ought
to
explain
this
murder
the
line
of
writing
yes
i
have
not
told
you
what
the
young
girl
said
as
she
slipped
with
her
companion
into
the
crowd
no
you
have
spoken
of
no
words
have
you
any
such
clew
as
that
miss
butterworth
you
are
fortunate
very
fortunate
gryce
look
and
gesture
were
eloquent
but
miss
butterworth
with
an
access
of
dignity
quietly
remarked
i
was
not
to
blame
for
being
in
the
way
when
they
passed
nor
could
i
help
hearing
what
she
said
and
what
was
it
madam
did
she
mention
a
paper
yes
she
cried
in
what
i
now
remember
to
have
been
a
tone
of
affright
have
left
that
line
of
writing
behind
i
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
these
words
then
but
when
i
came
upon
the
dying
man
so
evidently
the
victim
of
murder
i
recalled
what
his
late
visitor
had
said
and
looked
about
for
this
piece
of
writing
and
did
you
find
it
miss
butterworth
i
am
ready
as
you
see
for
any
revelation
you
may
now
make
for
one
which
would
reflect
dishonor
on
me
if
i
had
found
any
paper
explaining
this
tragedy
i
should
have
felt
bound
to
have
called
the
attention
of
the
police
to
it
i
did
notify
them
of
the
crime
itself
yes
madam
and
we
are
obliged
to
you
but
how
about
your
silence
in
regard
to
the
fact
of
two
persons
having
left
that
house
immediately
upon
or
just
preceding
the
death
of
its
master
i
reserved
that
bit
of
information
i
waited
to
see
if
the
police
would
not
get
wind
of
these
people
without
my
help
i
sincerely
wished
to
keep
my
name
out
of
this
inquiry
yet
i
feel
a
decided
relief
now
that
i
have
made
my
confession
i
never
could
have
rested
properly
after
seeing
so
much
and
well
thinking
my
own
thoughts
in
regard
to
what
i
saw
if
i
had
found
myself
compelled
to
bridle
my
tongue
while
false
scents
were
being
followed
and
delicate
clews
overlooked
or
discarded
without
proper
attention
i
regard
this
murder
as
offering
the
most
difficult
problem
that
has
ever
come
in
my
way
and
therefore
yes
madam
i
can
not
but
wonder
if
an
opportunity
has
been
afforded
me
for
retrieving
myself
in
your
eyes
i
do
not
care
for
the
opinion
of
any
one
else
as
to
my
ability
or
discretion
but
i
should
like
to
make
you
forget
my
last
despicable
failure
in
lost
man
lane
it
is
a
sore
remembrance
to
me
gryce
which
nothing
but
a
fresh
success
can
make
me
forget
madam
i
understand
you
you
have
formulated
some
theory
you
consider
the
young
man
with
the
face
guilty
of
adams
death
well
it
is
very
possible
i
never
thought
the
butler
was
rehearsing
a
crime
he
had
himself
committed
do
you
know
who
the
young
man
is
i
saw
leaving
that
house
so
hurriedly
not
the
least
in
the
world
you
are
the
first
to
bring
him
to
my
attention
and
the
young
girl
with
the
blonde
hair
it
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
her
too
i
did
not
scatter
the
rose
leaves
that
were
found
on
that
floor
no
it
was
she
she
probably
wore
a
bouquet
in
her
belt
nor
was
that
frippery
parasol
mine
though
i
did
lose
a
good
stout
serviceable
one
somewhere
that
day
it
was
hers
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
left
by
her
in
the
little
room
where
she
was
whiling
away
the
time
during
which
the
gentlemen
conversed
together
possibly
about
that
bit
of
writing
she
afterward
alluded
to
certainly
her
mind
was
not
expectant
of
evil
for
she
was
smoothing
her
hair
when
the
shock
came
yes
madam
i
follow
you
and
had
to
be
carried
out
of
the
place
after
what
she
had
placed
that
cross
on
adams
breast
that
was
a
act
mr
gryce
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
the
placing
of
that
cross
on
a
breast
was
a
mystery
to
me
and
is
still
i
must
own
great
remorse
or
great
fright
only
can
account
for
it
you
will
find
many
mysteries
in
this
case
mr
gryce
as
great
a
number
as
i
ever
encountered
i
have
to
add
one
another
it
concerns
the
old
butler
i
thought
you
did
not
see
him
i
did
not
see
him
in
the
room
where
adams
lay
ah
where
then
upstairs
my
interest
was
not
confined
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
wishing
to
spread
the
alarm
and
not
being
able
to
rouse
any
one
below
i
crept
upstairs
and
so
came
upon
this
poor
wretch
going
through
the
significant
pantomime
that
has
been
so
vividly
described
in
the
papers
ah
unpleasant
for
you
very
i
imagine
you
did
not
stop
to
talk
to
him
no
i
fled
i
was
extremely
shaken
up
by
this
time
and
knew
only
one
thing
to
do
and
that
was
to
escape
but
i
carried
one
as
yet
unsolved
enigma
with
me
how
came
i
to
hear
this
man
cries
in
study
and
yet
find
him
on
the
second
floor
when
i
came
to
search
the
house
he
had
not
time
to
mount
the
stairs
while
i
was
passing
down
the
hall
it
is
a
case
of
mistaken
impression
your
ears
played
you
false
the
cries
came
from
above
not
from
adams
study
my
ears
are
not
accustomed
to
play
me
tricks
you
must
seek
another
explanation
i
have
ransacked
the
house
there
are
no
back
stairs
if
there
were
the
study
does
not
communicate
with
them
and
you
heard
his
voice
in
the
study
plainly
well
you
have
given
me
a
poser
madam
and
i
will
give
you
another
if
he
was
the
perpetrator
of
this
crime
how
comes
it
that
he
was
not
detected
and
denounced
by
the
young
people
i
saw
going
out
if
on
the
contrary
he
was
simply
the
witness
of
another
man
blow
a
blow
which
horrified
him
so
much
that
it
unseated
his
reason
how
comes
it
that
he
was
able
to
slide
away
from
the
door
where
he
must
have
stood
without
attracting
the
attention
and
bringing
down
upon
himself
the
vengeance
of
the
guilty
murderer
he
may
be
one
of
the
noiseless
kind
or
rather
may
have
been
such
before
this
shock
unsettled
his
mind
true
but
he
would
have
been
seen
recall
the
position
of
the
doorway
if
adams
fell
where
he
was
struck
the
assailant
must
have
had
that
door
directly
before
him
he
could
not
have
helped
seeing
any
one
standing
in
it
that
is
true
your
observations
are
quite
correct
but
those
young
people
were
in
a
disordered
state
of
mind
the
condition
in
which
they
issued
from
the
house
proves
this
they
probably
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
this
man
escape
was
all
they
sought
and
you
see
they
did
escape
but
you
will
find
them
a
man
who
can
locate
a
woman
in
this
great
city
of
ours
with
no
other
clew
than
five
spangles
dropped
from
her
gown
will
certainly
make
this
parasol
tell
the
name
of
its
owner
ah
madam
the
credit
of
this
feat
is
not
due
to
me
it
was
the
initial
stroke
of
a
young
man
i
propose
to
adopt
into
my
home
and
heart
the
same
who
brought
you
here
not
much
to
look
at
madam
but
promising
very
promising
but
i
doubt
if
even
he
can
discover
the
young
lady
you
mean
with
no
other
aid
than
is
given
by
this
parasol
new
york
is
a
big
place
a
big
place
do
you
know
how
sweetwater
came
to
find
you
through
your
virtues
through
your
neat
and
methodical
habits
had
you
been
of
a
careless
turn
of
mind
and
not
given
to
mending
your
dresses
when
you
tore
them
he
might
have
worn
his
heart
out
in
a
vain
search
for
the
lady
who
had
dropped
the
five
spangles
in
adams
study
now
luck
or
rather
your
own
commendable
habit
was
in
his
favor
this
time
but
in
the
prospective
search
you
mentioned
he
will
probably
have
no
such
assistance
nor
will
he
need
it
i
have
unbounded
faith
in
your
genius
which
after
all
is
back
of
the
skilfulness
of
this
new
pupil
of
yours
you
will
discover
by
some
means
the
lady
with
the
plumes
and
through
her
the
young
gentleman
who
accompanied
her
we
shall
at
least
put
our
energies
to
work
in
that
direction
sweetwater
may
have
an
idea
and
i
may
have
one
you
yes
i
indulged
in
but
little
sleep
last
night
that
dreadful
room
with
its
unsolved
mystery
was
ever
before
me
thoughts
would
come
possibilities
would
suggest
themselves
i
imagined
myself
probing
its
secrets
to
the
bottom
and
wait
madam
how
many
of
its
secrets
do
you
know
you
said
nothing
about
the
lantern
it
was
burning
with
a
red
light
when
i
entered
you
did
not
touch
the
buttons
arranged
along
the
table
top
no
if
there
is
one
thing
i
do
not
touch
it
is
anything
which
suggests
an
electrical
contrivance
i
am
intensely
feminine
sir
in
all
my
instincts
and
mechanisms
of
any
kind
alarm
me
to
all
such
things
i
give
a
wide
berth
i
have
not
even
a
telephone
in
my
house
some
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
natural
timidity
of
woman
gryce
suppressed
a
smile
it
is
a
pity
he
remarked
had
you
brought
another
light
upon
the
scene
you
might
have
been
blessed
with
an
idea
on
a
subject
that
is
as
puzzling
as
any
connected
with
the
whole
affair
you
have
not
heard
what
i
have
to
say
on
a
still
more
important
matter
said
she
when
we
have
exhausted
the
one
topic
we
may
both
feel
like
turning
on
the
fresh
lights
you
speak
of
gryce
on
what
does
this
mystery
hinge
on
the
bit
of
writing
which
these
young
people
were
so
alarmed
at
having
left
behind
them
ah
it
is
from
that
you
would
work
well
it
is
a
good
point
to
start
from
but
we
have
found
no
such
bit
of
writing
have
you
searched
for
it
you
did
not
know
till
now
that
any
importance
might
be
attached
to
a
morsel
of
paper
with
some
words
written
on
it
true
but
a
detective
searches
just
the
same
we
ransacked
that
room
as
few
rooms
have
been
ransacked
in
years
not
for
a
known
clew
but
for
an
unknown
one
it
seemed
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
learn
who
this
man
was
his
papers
were
consequently
examined
but
they
told
nothing
if
there
had
been
a
scrap
of
writing
within
view
or
in
his
desk
it
was
not
on
his
person
you
had
his
pockets
searched
his
clothes
a
man
who
has
died
from
violence
is
always
searched
madam
i
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
a
mysterious
case
like
this
miss
butterworth
face
assumed
an
indefinable
expression
of
satisfaction
which
did
not
escape
gryce
eye
though
that
member
was
fixed
according
to
his
old
habit
on
the
miniature
of
her
father
which
she
wore
in
defiance
of
fashion
at
her
throat
i
wonder
said
she
in
a
musing
tone
if
i
imagined
or
really
saw
on
adams
face
a
most
extraordinary
expression
something
more
than
the
surprise
or
anguish
following
a
mortal
blow
a
look
of
determination
arguing
some
superhuman
resolve
taken
at
the
moment
of
death
or
can
you
read
that
face
for
me
or
did
you
fail
to
perceive
aught
of
what
i
say
it
would
really
be
an
aid
to
me
at
this
moment
to
know
i
noted
that
look
it
was
not
a
common
one
but
i
can
not
read
it
for
you
i
wonder
if
the
young
man
you
call
sweetwater
can
i
certainly
think
it
has
a
decided
bearing
on
this
mystery
such
a
fold
to
the
lips
such
a
look
of
mingled
grief
and
what
was
that
you
said
sweetwater
has
not
been
admitted
to
the
room
of
death
well
well
i
shall
have
to
make
my
own
suggestion
then
i
shall
have
to
part
with
an
idea
that
may
be
totally
valueless
but
which
has
impressed
me
so
that
it
must
out
if
i
am
to
have
any
peace
gryce
allow
me
to
whisper
in
your
ear
some
things
lose
force
when
spoken
aloud
and
leaning
forward
she
breathed
a
short
sentence
into
his
ear
which
made
him
start
and
regard
her
with
an
amazement
which
rapidly
grew
into
admiration
madam
he
cried
rising
up
that
he
might
the
better
honor
her
with
one
of
his
low
bows
your
idea
whether
valueless
or
not
is
one
which
is
worthy
of
the
acute
lady
who
proffers
it
we
will
act
on
it
act
at
once
wait
till
i
have
given
my
orders
i
will
not
keep
you
long
and
with
another
bow
he
left
the
room
chapter
vii
amos
son
miss
butterworth
had
been
brought
up
in
a
strict
school
of
manners
when
she
sat
she
sat
still
when
she
moved
she
moved
quickly
firmly
but
with
no
unnecessary
disturbance
fidgets
were
unknown
to
her
yet
when
she
found
herself
alone
after
this
interview
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
restrain
herself
from
indulging
in
some
of
those
outward
manifestations
of
uneasiness
which
she
had
all
her
life
reprobated
in
the
more
nervous
members
of
her
own
sex
she
was
anxious
and
she
showed
it
like
the
sensible
woman
she
was
and
was
glad
enough
when
gryce
finally
returned
and
accosting
her
with
a
smile
said
almost
gayly
well
that
is
seen
to
and
all
we
have
to
do
now
is
to
await
the
result
madam
have
you
any
further
ideas
if
so
i
should
be
glad
to
have
the
benefit
of
them
her
was
at
once
restored
you
would
she
repeated
eying
him
somewhat
doubtfully
i
should
like
to
be
assured
of
the
value
of
the
one
i
have
already
advanced
before
i
venture
upon
another
let
us
enter
into
a
conference
instead
compare
notes
tell
for
instance
why
neither
of
us
look
on
bartow
as
the
guilty
man
i
thought
we
had
exhausted
that
topic
your
suspicions
were
aroused
by
the
young
couple
you
saw
leaving
the
house
while
mine
well
madam
to
you
at
least
i
may
admit
that
there
is
something
in
the
gestures
and
general
manner
which
conveys
to
my
mind
the
impression
that
he
is
engaged
in
rehearsing
something
he
has
seen
rather
than
something
he
has
done
and
as
yet
i
have
seen
no
reason
for
doubting
the
truth
of
this
impression
i
was
affected
in
the
same
way
and
would
have
been
even
if
i
had
not
already
had
my
suspicions
turned
in
another
direction
besides
it
is
more
natural
for
a
man
to
be
driven
insane
by
another
act
than
by
his
own
yes
if
he
loved
the
victim
and
did
not
bartow
he
does
not
mourn
mr
adams
but
he
is
no
longer
master
of
his
emotions
very
true
but
if
we
take
any
of
his
actions
as
a
clew
to
the
situation
we
must
take
all
we
believe
from
his
gestures
that
he
is
giving
us
a
literal
copy
of
acts
he
has
seen
performed
then
why
pass
over
the
gleam
of
infernal
joy
that
lights
his
face
after
the
whole
is
over
it
is
as
if
he
rejoiced
over
the
deed
or
at
least
found
immeasurable
satisfaction
in
it
perhaps
it
is
still
a
copy
of
what
he
saw
the
murderer
may
have
rejoiced
but
no
there
was
no
joy
in
the
face
of
the
young
man
i
saw
rushing
away
from
this
scene
of
violence
quite
the
contrary
gryce
we
are
in
deep
waters
i
feel
myself
wellnigh
submerged
by
them
hold
up
your
head
madam
every
flood
has
its
ebb
if
you
allow
yourself
to
go
under
what
will
become
of
me
you
are
disposed
to
humor
gryce
it
is
a
good
sign
you
are
never
humorous
when
perplexed
somewhere
you
must
see
daylight
let
us
proceed
with
our
argument
illumination
frequently
comes
from
the
most
unexpected
quarter
very
well
then
let
us
put
the
old
man
joy
down
as
one
of
the
mysteries
to
be
explained
later
have
you
thought
of
him
as
a
possible
accomplice
certainly
but
this
supposition
is
open
to
the
same
objection
as
that
which
made
him
the
motive
power
in
this
murder
one
is
not
driven
insane
by
an
expected
horror
it
takes
shock
to
unsettle
the
brain
he
was
not
looking
for
the
death
of
his
master
true
we
may
consider
that
matter
as
settled
bartow
was
an
innocent
witness
of
this
crime
and
having
nothing
to
fear
may
be
trusted
to
reproduce
in
his
pantomimic
action
its
exact
features
very
good
continue
madam
nothing
but
profit
is
likely
to
follow
an
argument
presented
by
miss
butterworth
the
old
detective
tone
was
serious
his
manner
perfect
but
miss
butterworth
ever
on
the
for
sarcasm
from
his
lips
bridled
a
little
though
in
no
other
way
did
she
show
her
displeasure
let
us
then
recall
his
precise
gestures
remembering
that
he
must
have
surprised
the
assailant
from
the
study
doorway
and
so
have
seen
the
assault
from
over
his
master
shoulder
in
other
words
directly
in
front
of
him
now
what
was
his
first
move
his
first
move
as
now
seen
is
to
raise
his
right
arm
and
stretch
it
behind
him
while
he
leans
forward
for
the
imaginary
dagger
what
does
that
mean
i
should
find
it
hard
to
say
but
i
did
not
see
him
do
that
when
i
came
upon
him
he
was
thrusting
with
his
left
hand
across
his
own
body
a
vicious
thrust
and
with
his
left
hand
that
is
a
point
mr
gryce
yes
especially
as
the
doctors
agree
that
adams
was
killed
by
a
blow
you
do
say
do
you
see
the
difficulty
then
the
difficulty
madam
bartow
was
standing
face
to
face
with
the
assailant
in
imitating
him
especially
in
his
unreasoning
state
of
mind
he
would
lift
the
arm
opposite
to
the
one
whose
action
he
mimics
which
in
this
case
would
be
the
assailant
right
try
for
the
moment
to
mimic
my
actions
see
i
lift
this
hand
and
instinctively
nay
i
detected
the
movement
sir
quickly
as
you
remembered
yourself
you
raise
the
one
directly
opposite
to
it
it
is
like
seeing
yourself
in
a
mirror
you
turn
your
head
to
the
right
but
your
image
turns
to
the
left
gryce
laugh
rang
out
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
not
often
caught
napping
but
this
woman
exercised
a
species
of
fascination
upon
him
at
times
and
it
rather
amused
than
offended
him
when
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
himself
defeated
very
good
you
have
proved
your
point
quite
satisfactorily
but
what
conclusions
are
to
be
drawn
from
it
that
the
man
was
not
or
that
he
was
not
standing
in
the
place
you
have
assigned
to
him
shall
we
go
against
the
doctors
they
say
that
the
blow
was
a
one
gryce
i
would
give
anything
for
an
hour
spent
with
you
in
adams
study
with
bartow
free
to
move
about
at
his
will
i
think
we
would
learn
more
by
watching
him
for
a
short
space
of
time
than
in
talking
as
we
are
doing
for
an
hour
it
was
said
tentatively
almost
timidly
miss
butterworth
had
some
sense
of
the
temerity
involved
in
this
suggestion
even
if
according
to
her
own
declaration
she
had
no
curiosity
i
do
want
to
be
disagreeable
she
smiled
she
was
so
far
from
being
so
that
gryce
was
taken
unawares
and
for
once
in
his
life
became
impulsive
i
think
it
can
be
managed
madam
that
is
after
the
funeral
there
are
too
many
officials
now
in
the
house
and
of
course
of
course
she
acceded
i
should
not
think
of
obtruding
myself
at
present
but
the
case
is
so
interesting
and
my
connection
with
it
so
peculiar
that
i
sometimes
forget
myself
do
you
think
here
she
became
quite
nervous
for
one
of
her
marked
that
i
have
laid
myself
open
to
a
summons
from
the
coroner
gryce
grew
thoughtful
eyed
the
good
lady
or
rather
her
folded
hands
with
an
air
of
some
compassion
and
finally
replied
the
facts
regarding
this
affair
come
in
so
slowly
that
i
doubt
if
the
inquest
is
held
for
several
days
meanwhile
we
may
light
on
those
two
young
people
ourselves
if
so
the
coroner
may
your
share
in
bringing
them
to
our
notice
there
was
a
sly
emphasis
on
the
word
and
a
subtle
humor
in
his
look
that
showed
the
old
detective
at
his
worst
but
miss
butterworth
did
not
resent
it
she
was
too
full
of
a
fresh
confession
she
had
to
make
ah
said
she
if
they
had
been
the
only
persons
i
encountered
there
but
they
were
not
another
person
entered
the
house
before
i
left
it
and
i
may
be
obliged
to
speak
of
him
of
him
really
madam
you
are
a
mine
of
intelligence
yes
sir
was
the
meek
reply
meek
when
you
consider
from
whose
lips
it
came
i
ought
to
have
spoken
of
him
before
but
i
never
like
to
mix
matters
and
this
old
gentleman
old
gentleman
yes
sir
very
old
and
very
much
of
a
gentleman
did
not
appear
to
have
any
connection
with
the
crime
beyond
knowing
the
murdered
man
ah
but
that
a
big
connection
to
find
some
one
who
knew
adams
really
madam
patience
has
its
limits
and
i
must
press
you
to
speak
oh
i
will
speak
the
time
has
come
for
it
besides
i
quite
ready
to
discuss
this
new
theme
it
is
very
interesting
suppose
we
begin
then
by
a
detailed
account
of
your
adventures
in
this
house
of
death
dryly
suggested
the
detective
your
full
adventures
madam
with
nothing
left
out
i
appreciate
the
sarcasm
but
nothing
has
been
left
out
except
what
i
am
about
to
relate
to
you
it
happened
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
what
did
i
hate
to
ask
you
to
be
more
explicit
but
in
the
interests
of
justice
you
are
quite
right
as
i
was
going
out
then
i
encountered
an
elderly
gentleman
coming
in
his
hand
had
just
touched
the
bell
handle
you
will
acknowledge
that
it
was
a
perplexing
moment
for
me
his
face
which
was
well
preserved
for
his
years
wore
an
air
of
expectation
that
was
almost
gay
he
glanced
in
astonishment
at
mine
which
whatever
its
usual
serenity
certainly
must
have
borne
marks
of
deep
emotion
neither
of
us
spoke
at
last
he
inquired
politely
if
he
might
enter
and
said
something
about
having
an
appointment
with
some
one
in
the
study
at
which
i
stepped
briskly
enough
aside
i
assure
you
for
this
might
mean
what
did
you
say
did
i
close
the
door
i
assuredly
did
was
i
to
let
the
whole
of
street
into
the
horrors
of
this
house
at
a
moment
when
a
poor
old
man
no
i
did
go
out
myself
why
should
i
was
i
to
leave
a
man
on
the
verge
of
eighty
excuse
me
not
every
man
of
eighty
is
so
hale
and
vigorous
as
yourself
to
enter
such
a
scene
alone
besides
i
had
not
warned
him
of
the
condition
of
the
only
other
living
occupant
of
the
house
discreet
very
quite
what
was
to
be
expected
of
you
miss
butterworth
more
than
that
you
followed
him
no
doubt
with
careful
supervision
down
the
hall
most
certainly
what
would
you
have
thought
of
me
if
i
had
not
he
was
in
a
strange
house
there
was
no
servant
to
guide
him
he
wanted
to
know
the
way
to
the
study
and
i
politely
showed
him
there
kind
of
you
madam
very
it
must
have
been
an
interesting
moment
to
you
very
interesting
too
interesting
i
own
that
i
am
not
made
entirely
of
steel
sir
and
the
shock
he
received
at
finding
a
dead
man
awaiting
him
instead
of
a
live
one
was
more
or
less
communicated
to
me
yet
i
stood
my
ground
admirable
i
could
have
done
no
better
myself
and
so
this
man
who
had
an
appointment
with
adams
was
shocked
really
shocked
at
finding
him
lying
there
under
a
cross
dead
yes
there
was
no
doubting
that
shocked
surprised
terrified
and
something
more
it
is
that
something
more
which
has
proved
my
perplexity
i
can
not
make
it
out
not
even
in
thinking
it
over
was
it
the
fascination
which
all
horrible
sights
exert
on
the
morbid
or
was
it
a
sudden
realization
of
some
danger
he
had
escaped
or
of
some
difficulty
yet
awaiting
him
hard
to
say
gryce
hard
to
say
but
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
that
there
was
more
to
him
in
this
meeting
than
an
unexpected
stumbling
upon
a
dead
man
where
he
expected
to
find
a
live
one
yet
he
made
no
sound
after
that
first
cry
and
hardly
any
movement
he
just
stared
at
the
figure
on
the
floor
then
at
his
face
which
he
seemed
to
devour
at
first
with
curiosity
then
with
hate
then
with
terror
and
lastly
how
can
i
express
myself
with
a
sort
of
hellish
humor
that
in
another
moment
might
have
broken
into
something
like
a
laugh
if
the
bird
which
i
had
failed
to
observe
up
to
this
moment
had
not
waked
in
its
high
cage
and
thrusting
its
beak
between
the
bars
shrilled
out
in
the
most
alarming
of
tones
evelyn
that
startled
the
old
man
even
more
than
the
sight
on
the
floor
had
done
he
turned
round
and
i
saw
his
fist
rise
as
if
against
some
menacing
intruder
but
it
quickly
fell
again
as
his
eyes
encountered
the
picture
which
hung
before
him
and
with
a
cringe
painful
to
see
in
one
of
his
years
he
sidled
back
till
he
reached
the
doorway
here
he
paused
a
minute
to
give
another
look
at
the
man
outstretched
at
his
feet
and
i
heard
him
say
is
amos
son
not
amos
is
it
fatality
or
did
he
plan
this
meeting
thinking
but
here
he
caught
sight
of
my
figure
in
the
antechamber
beyond
and
resuming
in
an
instant
his
former
debonair
manner
he
bowed
very
low
and
opened
his
lips
as
if
about
to
ask
a
question
but
he
evidently
thought
better
of
it
for
he
strode
by
me
and
made
his
way
to
the
front
door
without
a
word
being
an
intruder
myself
i
did
not
like
to
stop
him
but
i
am
sorry
now
for
the
consideration
i
showed
him
for
just
before
he
stepped
out
his
emotion
the
special
character
of
which
i
own
to
you
i
find
impossible
to
understand
culminated
in
a
burst
of
raucous
laughter
which
added
the
final
horror
to
this
amazing
adventure
then
he
went
out
and
in
the
last
glimpse
i
had
of
him
before
the
door
shut
he
wore
the
same
look
of
easy
with
which
he
had
entered
this
place
of
death
some
fifteen
minutes
before
remarkable
some
secret
history
there
that
man
must
be
found
he
can
throw
light
upon
adams
past
son
he
called
him
who
is
amos
adams
name
was
felix
felix
the
son
of
amos
perhaps
this
connection
of
names
may
lead
to
something
it
is
not
a
common
one
and
if
given
to
the
papers
may
result
in
our
receiving
a
clew
to
a
mystery
which
seems
impenetrable
your
stay
in
adams
house
was
quite
productive
did
you
prolong
it
after
the
departure
of
this
old
man
no
sir
i
had
had
my
fill
of
the
mysterious
and
left
immediately
after
him
ashamed
of
the
spirit
of
investigation
which
had
led
me
to
enter
the
house
i
made
a
street
boy
the
medium
of
my
communication
to
the
police
and
would
have
been
glad
if
i
could
have
so
escaped
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
but
the
irony
of
fate
follows
me
as
it
does
others
a
clew
was
left
of
my
presence
which
involves
me
in
this
affair
whether
i
will
or
no
was
the
hand
of
providence
in
this
perhaps
the
future
will
tell
and
now
gryce
since
my
budget
is
quite
empty
and
the
hour
late
i
will
take
my
leave
if
you
hear
from
that
bit
of
paper
if
i
hear
from
it
in
the
way
you
suggest
i
will
let
you
know
it
will
be
the
least
i
can
do
for
a
lady
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
now
you
flatter
me
proof
positive
that
i
have
stayed
a
minute
longer
than
was
judicious
good
evening
gryce
what
i
have
not
stayed
too
long
you
have
something
else
to
ask
yes
and
this
time
it
is
concerning
a
matter
personal
to
yourself
may
i
inquire
if
you
wore
the
same
bonnet
yesterday
that
you
do
no
sir
i
know
you
have
a
good
reason
for
this
question
and
so
will
not
express
my
surprise
yesterday
i
was
in
reception
costume
and
my
bonnet
was
a
jet
one
with
long
strings
tied
under
the
chin
no
sir
short
strings
long
strings
are
no
longer
the
fashion
but
you
wore
something
which
fell
from
your
neck
yes
a
boa
a
feather
boa
how
came
you
to
know
it
sir
did
i
leave
my
image
in
one
of
the
mirrors
hardly
if
so
i
should
not
have
expected
it
to
speak
you
merely
wrote
the
fact
on
the
study
table
top
or
so
i
have
dared
to
think
you
or
the
young
lady
did
she
wear
ribbons
or
streamers
too
that
i
can
not
say
her
face
was
all
i
saw
and
the
skirt
of
a
silk
dress
then
you
must
settle
the
question
for
me
in
this
way
if
on
the
tips
of
that
boa
of
yours
you
find
the
faintest
evidence
of
its
having
been
dipped
in
blood
i
shall
know
that
the
streaks
found
on
the
top
of
the
table
i
speak
of
were
evidences
of
your
presence
there
but
if
your
boa
is
clean
or
was
not
long
enough
to
touch
that
dying
man
as
you
leaned
over
him
then
we
have
proof
that
the
young
lady
with
the
plumes
fingered
that
table
also
instead
of
falling
at
once
into
the
condition
in
which
you
saw
her
carried
out
i
fear
that
it
is
my
boa
which
will
tell
the
tale
another
proof
of
the
fallibility
of
man
or
rather
woman
in
secret
search
for
clews
i
left
behind
me
traces
of
my
own
presence
i
really
feel
mortified
sir
and
you
have
quite
the
advantage
of
me
and
with
this
show
of
humility
which
may
not
have
been
entirely
sincere
this
estimable
lady
took
her
departure
did
gryce
suffer
from
any
qualms
of
conscience
at
having
elicited
so
much
and
imparted
so
little
i
doubt
it
gryce
conscience
was
quite
seared
in
certain
places
chapter
viii
in
the
round
of
the
staircase
the
next
morning
gryce
received
a
small
communication
from
miss
butterworth
at
or
near
the
very
time
she
received
one
from
him
hers
ran
you
were
quite
correct
so
far
as
appears
i
was
the
only
person
to
lean
over
adams
study
table
after
his
unfortunate
death
i
have
had
to
clip
the
ends
of
my
boa
his
was
equally
laconic
my
compliments
madam
adams
jaws
have
been
forced
apart
a
small
piece
of
paper
was
found
clinched
between
his
teeth
this
paper
has
been
recovered
and
will
be
read
at
the
inquest
perhaps
a
few
favored
persons
may
be
granted
the
opportunity
of
reading
it
before
then
notably
yourself
of
the
two
letters
the
latter
naturally
occasioned
the
greater
excitement
in
the
recipient
the
complacency
of
miss
butterworth
was
superb
and
being
the
result
of
something
that
could
not
be
communicated
to
those
about
her
occasioned
in
the
household
much
speculation
as
to
its
cause
at
police
headquarters
more
than
one
man
was
kept
busy
listening
to
the
idle
tales
of
a
crowd
of
informers
the
results
which
had
failed
to
follow
the
first
day
publication
of
the
crime
came
rapidly
in
during
the
second
there
were
innumerable
persons
of
all
ages
and
conditions
who
were
ready
to
tell
how
they
had
seen
this
and
that
one
issue
from
adams
house
on
the
afternoon
of
his
death
but
when
asked
to
give
a
description
of
these
persons
lost
themselves
in
generalities
as
tedious
as
they
were
unprofitable
one
garrulous
old
woman
had
observed
a
lady
of
genteel
appearance
open
the
door
to
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
and
a
fashionably
dressed
young
woman
came
in
all
breathless
to
relate
how
a
young
man
with
a
very
pale
young
lady
on
his
arm
ran
against
her
as
she
was
going
by
this
house
at
the
very
hour
adams
was
said
to
have
been
murdered
she
could
not
be
sure
of
knowing
the
young
man
again
and
could
not
say
if
the
young
lady
was
blonde
or
brunette
only
that
she
was
awfully
pale
and
had
a
beautiful
gray
feather
in
her
hat
others
were
ready
with
similar
stories
which
confirmed
without
adding
to
the
facts
already
known
and
night
came
on
without
much
progress
having
been
made
toward
the
unravelling
of
this
formidable
mystery
on
the
next
day
adams
funeral
took
place
no
relatives
or
intimate
friends
having
come
forward
his
landlord
attended
to
these
rites
and
his
banker
acted
the
part
of
chief
mourner
as
his
body
was
carried
out
of
the
house
a
detectives
mingled
with
the
crowd
blocking
the
thoroughfare
in
front
but
nothing
came
of
their
surveillance
here
or
at
the
cemetery
to
which
the
remains
were
speedily
carried
the
problem
which
had
been
presented
to
the
police
had
to
be
worked
out
from
such
material
as
had
already
come
to
hand
and
in
forcible
recognition
of
this
fact
gryce
excused
himself
one
evening
at
headquarters
and
proceeded
quite
alone
and
on
foot
to
the
dark
and
apparently
closed
house
in
which
the
tragedy
had
occurred
he
entered
with
a
key
and
once
inside
proceeded
to
light
up
the
whole
house
this
done
he
took
a
look
at
the
study
saw
that
the
cross
had
been
replaced
on
the
wall
the
rehung
on
its
hook
under
the
ceiling
and
everything
put
in
its
wonted
order
with
the
exception
of
the
broken
casings
which
still
yawned
in
a
state
of
disrepair
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
leading
into
the
study
the
steel
plate
had
been
shoved
back
into
the
place
prepared
for
it
by
adams
but
the
glimpses
still
to
be
seen
of
its
blue
surface
through
the
hole
made
in
the
wall
of
the
antechamber
formed
anything
but
an
attractive
feature
in
the
scene
and
gryce
with
something
of
the
instinct
and
much
of
the
deftness
of
a
housewife
proceeded
to
pull
up
a
couple
of
rugs
from
the
parlor
floor
and
string
them
over
these
openings
then
he
consulted
his
watch
and
finding
that
it
was
within
an
hour
of
nine
took
up
his
stand
behind
the
curtains
of
the
parlor
window
soon
for
the
person
expected
was
as
prompt
as
himself
he
saw
a
carriage
stop
and
a
lady
alight
and
he
hastened
to
the
front
door
to
receive
her
it
was
miss
butterworth
madam
your
punctuality
is
equal
to
my
own
said
he
have
you
ordered
your
coachman
to
drive
away
only
as
far
as
the
corner
she
returned
as
she
followed
him
down
the
hall
there
he
will
await
the
call
of
your
whistle
nothing
could
be
better
are
you
afraid
to
remain
for
a
moment
alone
while
i
watch
from
the
window
the
arrival
of
the
other
persons
we
expect
at
present
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
but
ourselves
if
i
was
subject
to
fear
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
i
should
not
be
here
at
all
besides
the
house
is
very
cheerfully
lighted
i
see
you
have
chosen
a
crimson
light
for
illuminating
the
study
because
a
crimson
light
was
burning
when
adams
died
remember
evelyn
called
out
a
voice
oh
you
have
brought
back
the
bird
exclaimed
miss
butterworth
that
is
not
the
cry
with
which
it
greeted
me
before
it
was
lovely
eva
do
you
suppose
eva
and
evelyn
are
the
same
madam
we
have
so
many
riddles
before
us
that
we
will
let
this
one
go
for
the
present
i
expect
adams
valet
here
in
a
moment
sir
you
relieve
me
of
an
immense
weight
i
was
afraid
that
the
privilege
of
being
present
at
the
test
you
propose
to
make
was
not
to
be
accorded
me
miss
butterworth
you
have
earned
a
seat
at
this
experiment
bartow
has
been
given
a
key
and
will
enter
as
of
old
in
entire
freedom
to
do
as
he
wills
we
have
simply
to
watch
his
movements
in
this
room
sir
i
do
not
think
i
shall
like
that
i
had
rather
not
meet
this
madman
face
to
face
you
will
not
be
called
upon
to
do
so
we
do
not
wish
him
to
be
startled
by
encountering
any
watchful
eye
irresponsible
as
he
is
he
must
be
allowed
to
move
about
without
anything
to
distract
his
attention
nothing
must
stand
in
the
way
of
his
following
those
impulses
which
may
yield
us
a
clew
to
his
habits
and
the
ways
of
this
peculiar
household
i
propose
to
place
you
where
the
chances
are
least
in
favor
of
your
being
seen
by
him
in
this
parlor
madam
which
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
was
seldom
opened
during
adams
lifetime
you
must
put
out
the
gas
then
or
the
unaccustomed
light
will
attract
his
attention
i
will
not
only
put
out
the
gas
but
i
will
draw
the
portières
close
making
this
little
hole
for
your
eye
and
this
one
for
mine
a
common
expedient
madam
but
serviceable
madam
serviceable
the
snort
which
miss
butterworth
gave
as
she
thus
found
herself
drawn
up
in
darkness
before
a
curtain
in
company
with
this
plausible
old
man
but
feebly
conveyed
her
sensations
which
were
naturally
complex
and
a
little
puzzling
to
herself
had
she
been
the
possessor
of
a
lively
curiosity
but
we
know
from
her
own
lips
that
she
was
not
she
might
have
found
some
enjoyment
in
the
situation
but
being
where
she
was
solely
from
a
sense
of
duty
she
probably
blushed
behind
her
screen
at
the
position
in
which
she
found
herself
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
or
would
have
done
so
if
the
opening
of
the
front
door
at
that
moment
had
not
told
her
that
the
critical
moment
had
arrived
and
that
the
valet
had
just
been
introduced
into
the
house
the
faintest
hush
from
gryce
warned
her
that
her
surmise
was
correct
and
bending
her
every
energy
to
listen
she
watched
for
the
expected
appearance
of
this
man
in
the
antechamber
of
adams
former
study
he
came
even
sooner
than
she
was
prepared
to
see
him
and
laying
down
his
hat
on
a
table
near
the
doorway
advanced
with
a
busy
air
toward
the
portière
he
had
doubtless
been
in
the
habit
of
lifting
twenty
times
a
day
but
he
barely
touched
it
this
time
something
seen
or
unseen
prevented
him
from
entering
was
it
the
memory
of
what
he
had
last
beheld
there
or
had
he
noticed
the
rugs
hanging
in
an
unaccustomed
way
on
either
side
of
the
damaged
casings
neither
apparently
for
he
simply
turned
away
with
a
meek
look
wholly
mechanical
and
taking
up
his
hat
again
left
the
antechamber
and
proceeded
softly
upstairs
i
will
follow
him
whispered
gryce
do
be
afraid
this
whistle
will
bring
a
man
in
from
the
street
at
once
i
am
not
afraid
i
would
be
ashamed
but
it
was
useless
for
her
to
finish
this
disclaimer
gryce
was
already
in
the
hall
he
returned
speedily
and
saying
that
the
experiment
was
likely
to
be
a
failure
as
the
old
man
had
gone
to
his
own
room
and
was
preparing
himself
for
bed
he
led
the
way
into
the
study
and
with
purpose
or
without
a
purpose
who
knows
idly
touched
a
button
on
the
table
top
thus
throwing
a
new
light
on
the
scene
it
was
miss
butterworth
first
experience
of
this
change
of
light
and
she
was
observing
the
effect
made
by
the
violet
glow
now
thrown
over
the
picture
and
the
other
rich
articles
in
the
room
when
her
admiration
was
cut
short
and
gryce
remark
also
by
the
faint
sound
of
the
valet
descending
steps
indeed
they
had
barely
time
to
regain
their
old
position
behind
the
parlor
portières
when
bartow
was
seen
hurrying
in
from
the
hall
with
his
former
busy
air
which
this
time
remained
unchecked
crossing
to
his
master
study
he
paused
for
an
infinitesimal
length
of
time
on
the
threshold
as
if
conscious
of
something
being
amiss
then
went
into
the
room
beyond
and
without
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
rug
which
had
been
carefully
relaid
on
the
spot
where
his
master
had
fallen
began
to
make
such
arrangements
for
the
night
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
at
this
hour
he
brought
a
bottle
of
wine
from
the
cupboard
and
set
it
on
the
table
and
then
a
glass
which
he
first
wiped
scrupulously
clean
then
he
took
out
his
master
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
placing
them
to
hand
went
into
the
bedroom
by
this
time
the
two
watchers
had
crept
from
their
concealment
near
enough
to
note
what
he
was
doing
in
the
bedroom
he
was
stooping
over
the
comb
which
gryce
had
left
lying
on
the
floor
this
small
object
in
such
a
place
seemed
to
surprise
him
he
took
it
up
shook
his
head
and
put
it
back
on
the
dresser
then
he
turned
down
his
master
bed
poor
fool
murmured
miss
butterworth
as
she
and
her
companion
crept
back
to
their
old
place
behind
the
parlor
curtains
he
has
forgotten
everything
but
his
old
routine
duties
we
shall
get
nothing
from
this
man
but
she
stopped
suddenly
they
both
stopped
bartow
was
in
the
middle
of
the
study
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
master
empty
chair
in
an
inquiring
way
that
spoke
volumes
then
he
turned
and
gazed
earnestly
at
the
rug
where
he
had
last
seen
that
master
lying
outstretched
and
breathless
and
awakening
to
a
realization
of
what
had
happened
fell
into
his
most
violent
self
and
proceeded
to
go
through
the
series
of
actions
which
they
were
now
bound
to
consider
a
reproduction
of
what
he
had
previously
seen
take
place
there
then
he
went
softly
out
and
crept
away
upstairs
gryce
and
miss
butterworth
stepped
at
once
into
the
light
and
surveyed
each
other
with
a
look
of
marked
discouragement
then
the
latter
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
enthusiasm
cried
quickly
turn
on
another
color
and
let
us
see
what
will
happen
i
have
an
idea
it
will
fetch
the
old
man
down
again
gryce
brows
went
up
do
you
think
he
can
see
through
the
floor
but
he
touched
a
button
and
a
rich
blue
took
the
place
of
the
violet
nothing
happened
miss
butterworth
looked
disturbed
i
have
confidence
in
your
theories
began
gryce
but
when
they
imply
the
possibility
of
this
man
seeing
through
blank
walls
and
obeying
signals
which
can
have
no
signification
to
any
one
on
the
floor
above
hark
she
cried
holding
up
one
finger
with
a
triumphant
air
the
old
man
steps
could
be
heard
descending
this
time
he
approached
with
considerable
feebleness
passed
slowly
into
the
study
advanced
to
the
table
and
reached
out
his
hands
as
if
to
lift
something
which
he
expected
to
find
there
seeing
nothing
he
glanced
in
astonishment
up
at
the
book
shelves
and
then
back
to
the
table
shook
his
head
and
suddenly
collapsing
sank
in
a
doze
on
the
nearest
chair
miss
butterworth
drew
a
long
breath
eyed
gryce
with
some
curiosity
and
then
triumphantly
exclaimed
can
you
read
the
meaning
of
all
that
i
think
i
can
do
you
see
that
he
came
expecting
to
find
a
pile
of
books
on
the
table
which
it
was
probably
his
business
to
restore
to
their
shelves
but
how
can
he
know
what
light
is
burning
here
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
there
is
no
possible
communication
between
this
room
and
the
one
in
which
he
has
always
been
found
by
any
one
going
above
miss
butterworth
manner
showed
a
hesitation
that
was
almost
naive
she
smiled
and
there
was
apology
in
her
smile
though
none
in
her
voice
as
she
remarked
with
odd
breaks
when
i
went
upstairs
you
know
i
went
upstairs
when
i
was
here
before
i
saw
a
little
thing
a
very
little
thing
which
you
doubtless
observed
yourself
and
which
may
explain
though
i
do
not
know
how
why
bartow
can
perceive
these
lights
from
the
floor
above
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
about
it
madam
i
thought
i
had
thoroughly
searched
those
rooms
and
the
halls
and
the
halls
and
that
nothing
in
them
could
have
escaped
my
eyes
but
if
you
have
a
more
patient
vision
than
myself
or
make
it
my
business
to
look
lower
how
to
look
lower
to
look
on
the
floor
say
on
the
floor
the
floor
sometimes
reveals
much
shows
where
a
person
steps
the
oftenest
and
therefore
where
he
has
the
most
business
you
must
have
noticed
how
marred
the
woodwork
is
at
the
edge
of
the
carpeting
on
that
little
landing
above
in
the
round
of
the
staircase
yes
gryce
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
answer
perhaps
he
had
not
time
for
leaving
the
valet
where
he
was
and
miss
butterworth
where
she
was
only
she
would
not
be
left
but
followed
him
he
made
his
way
upstairs
and
paused
at
the
place
she
had
mentioned
with
a
curious
look
at
the
floor
you
see
it
has
been
much
trodden
here
she
said
at
which
gentle
reminder
of
her
presence
he
gave
a
start
possibly
he
had
not
heard
her
behind
him
and
after
sixty
years
of
hard
service
even
a
detective
may
be
excused
a
slight
nervousness
now
why
should
it
be
trodden
here
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
any
one
should
shuffle
to
and
fro
in
this
corner
the
stair
is
wide
especially
here
and
there
is
no
window
gryce
whose
eye
had
been
travelling
over
the
wall
reached
over
her
shoulder
to
one
of
the
dozen
pictures
hanging
at
intervals
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
pulling
it
away
from
the
wall
on
which
it
hung
decidedly
askew
revealed
a
round
opening
through
which
poured
a
ray
of
blue
light
which
could
only
proceed
from
the
vault
of
the
adjoining
study
no
window
he
repeated
no
but
an
opening
into
the
study
wall
which
answers
the
same
purpose
miss
butterworth
your
eye
is
to
be
trusted
every
time
i
only
wonder
you
did
not
pull
this
picture
aside
yourself
it
was
not
hanging
crooked
then
besides
i
was
in
a
hurry
i
had
just
come
from
my
encounter
with
this
demented
man
i
had
noticed
the
marks
on
the
landing
and
the
worn
edges
of
the
carpet
on
my
way
upstairs
i
was
in
no
condition
to
observe
them
on
my
way
down
i
see
miss
butterworth
ran
her
foot
to
and
fro
over
the
flooring
they
were
examining
bartow
was
evidently
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
constantly
said
she
probably
to
learn
whether
his
master
had
need
of
him
ingenious
in
adams
to
contrive
signals
for
communication
with
this
man
he
certainly
had
great
use
for
his
servant
so
one
mystery
is
solved
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
can
by
a
glance
through
this
loophole
obtain
the
answer
to
another
you
are
wondering
i
believe
how
bartow
if
he
followed
the
movements
of
the
assailant
from
the
doorway
came
to
thrust
with
his
left
hand
instead
of
with
his
right
now
if
he
saw
the
tragedy
from
this
point
he
saw
it
over
the
assailant
shoulder
instead
of
face
to
face
what
follows
he
would
imitate
literally
the
movements
of
the
man
he
saw
turn
in
the
same
direction
and
strike
with
the
same
hand
gryce
we
are
beginning
to
untangle
the
threads
that
looked
so
complicated
ah
what
is
that
why
it
that
bird
his
cage
must
be
very
nearly
under
this
hole
a
little
to
one
side
madam
but
near
enough
to
give
you
a
start
what
was
it
he
cried
then
oh
those
sympathetic
words
about
eva
eva
well
give
a
glance
to
bartow
you
can
see
him
very
well
from
here
miss
butterworth
put
her
eye
again
to
the
opening
and
gave
a
grunt
a
very
decided
grunt
with
her
a
grunt
was
significant
of
surprise
he
is
shaking
his
fist
he
is
all
alive
with
passion
he
looks
as
if
he
would
like
to
kill
the
bird
perhaps
that
is
why
the
creature
was
strung
up
so
high
you
may
be
sure
adams
had
some
basis
for
his
idiosyncrasies
i
begin
to
think
so
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
go
back
where
that
man
is
he
has
a
very
murderous
look
and
a
very
feeble
arm
miss
butterworth
you
are
safe
under
my
protection
my
arm
is
not
feeble
illustration
stand
to
bedroom
picture
on
stair
landing
to
study
footnote
since
my
readers
may
not
understand
how
an
opening
above
the
stairway
might
communicate
with
adams
study
i
here
submit
a
diagram
of
the
same
the
study
walls
were
very
high
forming
a
rounded
extension
at
the
back
of
the
house
chapter
ix
high
and
low
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
gryce
excused
himself
and
calling
in
two
or
three
men
whom
he
had
left
outside
had
the
valet
removed
before
taking
miss
butterworth
back
into
the
study
when
all
was
quiet
again
and
they
found
an
opportunity
to
speak
gryce
remarked
one
very
important
thing
has
been
settled
by
the
experiment
we
have
just
made
bartow
is
acquitted
of
participation
in
this
crime
then
we
can
give
our
full
attention
to
the
young
people
you
have
heard
nothing
from
them
i
suppose
no
nor
from
the
old
man
who
laughed
no
miss
butterworth
looked
disappointed
i
thought
it
seemed
very
probable
that
the
scrap
of
writing
you
found
would
inform
you
who
these
were
if
it
was
important
enough
for
the
dying
man
to
try
to
swallow
it
it
certainly
should
give
some
clew
to
his
assailant
unfortunately
it
does
not
do
so
it
was
a
veritable
scrawl
madam
running
something
like
this
return
your
daughter
to
you
she
is
here
neither
she
nor
you
will
ever
see
me
again
remember
evelyn
and
signed
son
amos
son
that
is
adams
himself
so
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
strange
unaccountable
and
the
paper
inscribed
with
these
words
was
found
clinched
between
his
teeth
was
the
handwriting
recognized
yes
as
his
own
if
we
can
judge
from
the
specimens
we
have
seen
of
his
signature
on
the
of
his
books
well
mysteries
deepen
and
the
retaining
of
this
paper
was
so
important
to
him
that
even
in
his
death
throe
he
thrust
it
in
this
strangest
of
all
as
being
the
only
one
that
could
be
considered
safe
from
search
and
the
girl
her
first
words
on
coming
to
herself
were
have
left
that
line
of
writing
behind
gryce
those
words
few
and
inexplicable
as
they
are
contain
the
key
to
the
whole
situation
will
you
repeat
them
again
if
you
please
sentence
by
sentence
with
pleasure
madam
i
have
said
them
often
enough
to
myself
first
then
return
your
daughter
to
you
so
adams
had
some
one
daughter
in
charge
whom
he
returns
whose
daughter
not
that
young
man
daughter
certainly
for
that
would
necessitate
her
being
a
small
child
besides
if
these
words
had
been
meant
for
his
assailant
why
make
so
remarkable
an
effort
to
hide
them
from
him
very
true
i
have
said
the
same
thing
to
myself
yet
if
not
for
him
for
whom
then
for
the
old
gentleman
who
came
in
later
it
is
possible
since
hearing
of
him
i
have
allowed
myself
to
regard
this
as
among
the
possibilities
especially
as
the
next
words
of
this
strange
communication
are
is
here
now
the
only
woman
who
was
there
a
few
minutes
previous
to
this
old
gentleman
visit
was
the
girl
whom
you
saw
carried
out
very
true
but
why
do
you
reason
as
if
this
paper
had
just
been
written
it
might
have
been
an
old
scrap
referring
to
past
sorrows
or
secrets
these
words
were
written
that
afternoon
the
paper
on
which
they
were
scrawled
was
torn
from
a
sheet
of
letter
paper
lying
on
the
desk
and
the
pen
with
which
they
were
inscribed
you
must
have
noticed
where
it
lay
quite
out
of
its
natural
place
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
table
certainly
sir
but
i
had
little
idea
of
the
significance
we
might
come
to
attach
to
it
these
words
are
connected
then
with
the
girl
i
saw
and
she
is
not
evelyn
or
he
would
not
have
repeated
in
this
note
the
bird
evelyn
i
wonder
if
she
is
evelyn
proceeded
miss
butterworth
pointing
to
the
one
large
picture
which
adorned
the
wall
we
may
call
her
so
for
the
nonce
so
melancholy
a
face
may
well
suggest
some
painful
family
secret
but
how
explain
the
violent
part
played
by
the
young
man
who
is
not
mentioned
in
these
abrupt
and
hastily
penned
sentences
it
is
all
a
mystery
madam
a
mystery
which
we
are
wasting
time
to
attempt
to
solve
yet
i
hate
to
give
it
up
without
an
effort
those
words
now
there
were
some
other
words
you
have
not
repeated
to
me
they
came
before
that
injunction
evelyn
they
bespoke
a
resolve
she
nor
you
will
ever
see
me
again
ah
but
these
few
words
are
very
significant
gryce
could
he
have
dealt
that
blow
himself
may
he
have
been
a
suicide
after
all
madam
you
have
the
right
to
inquire
but
from
bartow
pantomime
you
must
have
perceived
it
is
not
a
blow
he
mimics
but
a
maddened
thrust
from
an
outraged
hand
let
us
keep
to
our
first
conclusions
only
to
be
fair
to
every
possibility
the
condition
of
adams
affairs
and
the
absence
of
all
family
papers
and
such
documents
as
may
usually
be
found
in
a
wealthy
man
desk
prove
that
he
had
made
some
preparation
for
possible
death
it
may
have
come
sooner
than
he
expected
and
in
another
way
but
it
was
a
thought
he
had
indulged
in
and
madam
i
have
a
confession
to
make
also
i
have
not
been
quite
fair
to
my
most
valued
colleague
the
study
that
most
remarkable
of
rooms
contains
a
secret
which
has
not
been
imparted
to
you
a
very
peculiar
one
madam
which
was
revealed
to
me
in
a
rather
startling
manner
this
room
can
be
or
rather
could
be
cut
off
entirely
from
the
rest
of
the
house
made
a
of
or
rather
a
tomb
in
which
this
incomprehensible
man
may
have
intended
to
die
look
at
this
plate
of
steel
it
is
worked
by
a
mechanism
which
forces
it
across
this
open
doorway
i
was
behind
that
plate
of
steel
the
other
night
and
these
holes
had
to
be
made
to
let
me
out
ha
you
detectives
have
your
experiences
i
should
not
have
enjoyed
spending
that
especial
evening
with
you
but
what
an
tragedy
we
are
unearthing
here
i
declare
and
the
good
lady
actually
rubbed
her
eyes
i
feel
as
if
transported
back
to
mediæval
days
who
says
we
are
living
in
new
york
within
sound
of
the
cable
car
and
the
singing
of
the
telegraph
wire
some
men
are
perfectly
capable
of
bringing
the
mediæval
into
wall
street
i
think
adams
was
one
of
those
men
romanticism
tinged
all
his
acts
even
the
death
he
died
nor
did
it
cease
with
his
death
it
followed
him
to
the
tomb
witness
the
cross
we
found
lying
on
his
bosom
that
was
the
act
of
another
hand
the
result
of
superstition
that
shows
the
presence
of
a
priest
or
a
woman
at
the
moment
he
died
yet
proceeded
gryce
with
a
somewhat
wondering
air
he
must
have
had
a
grain
of
hard
sense
in
his
all
his
contrivances
worked
he
was
a
mechanical
genius
as
well
as
a
lover
of
mystery
an
odd
combination
strange
that
we
do
not
feel
his
spirit
infecting
the
very
air
of
this
study
i
could
almost
wish
it
did
we
might
then
be
led
to
grasp
the
key
to
this
mystery
that
remarked
gryce
can
be
done
in
only
one
way
you
have
already
pointed
it
out
we
must
trace
the
young
couple
who
were
present
at
his
death
struggle
if
they
can
not
be
found
the
case
is
hopeless
and
so
said
she
we
come
around
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
proof
positive
that
we
are
lost
in
the
woods
and
miss
butterworth
rose
she
felt
that
for
the
time
being
she
at
least
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
resources
gryce
did
not
seek
to
detain
her
indeed
he
appeared
to
be
anxious
to
leave
the
place
himself
they
however
stopped
long
enough
to
cast
one
final
look
around
them
as
they
did
so
miss
butterworth
finger
slowly
rose
see
said
she
you
can
hardly
perceive
from
this
side
of
the
wall
the
opening
made
by
the
removal
of
that
picture
on
the
stair
landing
would
you
say
that
it
was
in
the
midst
of
those
folds
of
tapestry
up
there
yes
i
had
already
located
that
spot
as
the
one
with
the
picture
hung
up
on
the
other
side
it
would
be
quite
invisible
one
needs
to
keep
one
eyes
moving
in
a
case
like
this
that
picture
must
have
been
drawn
aside
several
times
while
we
were
in
this
room
yet
we
failed
to
notice
it
that
was
from
not
looking
high
enough
high
and
low
gryce
what
goes
on
at
the
level
of
the
eye
is
apparent
to
every
one
the
smile
with
which
he
acknowledged
this
parting
shot
and
prepared
to
escort
her
to
the
door
had
less
of
irony
than
sadness
in
it
was
he
beginning
to
realize
that
years
tell
even
on
the
most
sagacious
and
that
neither
high
places
nor
low
would
have
escaped
his
attention
a
dozen
years
before
chapter
x
bride
roses
a
blonde
you
say
sir
yes
sweetwater
not
of
the
usual
type
but
one
of
those
frail
ethereal
creatures
whom
we
find
it
so
hard
to
associate
with
crime
he
on
the
contrary
according
to
miss
butterworth
description
and
her
descriptions
may
be
relied
upon
is
one
of
those
gentlemanly
athletes
whose
towering
heads
and
powerful
figures
attract
universal
attention
seen
together
you
would
be
apt
to
know
them
but
what
reason
have
we
for
thinking
they
will
be
found
together
how
were
they
dressed
like
people
of
fashion
and
respectability
he
wore
a
suit
apparently
fresh
from
the
tailor
she
a
dress
with
white
trimmings
the
parasol
shows
the
color
of
her
hat
and
plumes
both
were
young
and
still
according
to
miss
butterworth
of
sensitive
temperament
and
unused
to
crime
for
she
was
in
a
fainting
condition
when
carried
from
the
house
and
he
with
every
inducement
to
showed
himself
the
victim
of
such
powerful
emotion
that
he
would
have
been
immediately
surrounded
and
questioned
if
he
had
not
set
his
burden
down
in
the
vestibule
and
at
once
plunged
with
the
girl
into
the
passing
crowd
do
you
think
you
can
find
them
sweetwater
have
you
no
clews
to
their
identity
beyond
this
parasol
none
sweetwater
if
you
except
these
few
faded
rose
leaves
picked
up
from
the
floor
of
adams
study
then
you
have
given
me
a
problem
gryce
remarked
the
young
detective
dubiously
as
he
eyed
the
parasol
held
out
to
him
and
let
the
drop
carelessly
through
his
fingers
somehow
i
do
not
feel
the
same
assurances
of
success
that
i
did
before
perhaps
i
more
fully
realize
the
difficulties
of
any
such
quest
now
that
i
see
how
much
rests
upon
chance
in
these
matters
if
miss
butterworth
had
not
been
a
precise
woman
i
should
have
failed
in
my
former
attempt
as
i
am
likely
to
fail
in
this
one
but
i
will
make
another
effort
to
locate
the
owner
of
this
parasol
if
only
to
learn
my
business
by
failure
and
now
sir
where
do
you
think
i
am
going
first
to
a
florist
with
these
faded
just
because
every
other
young
fellow
on
the
force
would
make
a
start
from
the
parasol
i
am
going
to
try
and
effect
one
from
these
i
may
be
an
egotist
but
i
can
not
help
that
i
can
do
nothing
with
the
parasol
and
what
do
you
hope
to
do
with
the
how
can
a
florist
help
you
in
finding
this
young
woman
by
means
of
them
he
may
be
able
to
say
from
what
kind
of
a
rose
they
fell
and
once
i
know
that
i
may
succeed
in
discovering
the
particular
store
from
which
the
bouquet
was
sold
to
this
more
or
less
conspicuous
couple
you
may
i
am
not
the
man
to
throw
cold
water
on
any
one
schemes
every
man
has
his
own
methods
and
till
they
are
proved
valueless
i
say
nothing
young
sweetwater
who
was
now
all
nerve
enthusiasm
and
hope
bowed
he
was
satisfied
to
be
allowed
to
work
in
his
own
way
i
may
be
back
in
an
hour
and
you
may
not
see
me
for
a
week
he
remarked
on
leaving
luck
to
your
search
was
the
short
reply
this
ended
the
interview
in
a
few
minutes
more
sweetwater
was
off
the
hour
passed
he
did
not
come
back
the
day
and
still
no
sweetwater
another
day
went
by
enlivened
only
by
an
interchange
of
notes
between
gryce
and
miss
butterworth
hers
was
read
by
the
old
detective
with
a
smile
perhaps
because
it
was
so
terse
perhaps
because
it
was
so
characteristic
dear
gryce
i
do
not
presume
to
dictate
or
even
to
offer
a
suggestion
to
the
new
york
police
but
have
you
inquired
of
the
postman
in
a
certain
district
whether
he
can
recall
the
postmark
on
any
of
the
letters
he
delivered
to
adams
a
b
his
on
the
contrary
was
perused
with
a
frown
by
his
exacting
colleague
in
gramercy
park
the
reason
is
obvious
dear
miss
butterworth
suggestions
are
always
in
order
and
even
dictation
can
be
endured
from
you
the
postman
delivers
too
many
letters
on
that
block
to
concern
himself
with
postmarks
sorry
to
close
another
thoroughfare
meanwhile
the
anxiety
of
both
was
great
that
of
gryce
excessive
he
was
consequently
much
relieved
when
on
the
third
morning
he
found
sweetwater
awaiting
him
at
the
office
with
a
satisfied
smile
lighting
up
his
plain
features
he
had
reserved
his
story
for
his
special
patron
and
as
soon
as
they
were
closeted
together
he
turned
with
beaming
eyes
toward
the
old
detective
crying
news
sir
good
news
i
have
found
them
i
have
found
them
both
and
by
such
a
happy
stroke
it
was
a
blind
trail
but
when
the
florist
said
that
those
petals
might
have
fallen
from
a
bride
rose
well
sir
i
know
that
any
woman
can
carry
bride
roses
but
when
i
remembered
that
the
clothes
of
her
companion
looked
as
though
they
had
just
come
from
the
tailor
and
that
she
wore
gray
and
white
why
it
gave
me
an
idea
and
i
began
my
search
after
this
unknown
pair
at
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
brilliant
ejaculated
the
old
detective
that
is
if
the
thing
worked
and
it
did
sir
it
did
i
may
have
been
born
under
a
lucky
star
probably
was
but
once
started
on
this
line
of
search
i
went
straight
to
the
end
shall
i
tell
you
how
hunting
through
the
list
of
such
persons
as
had
been
married
within
the
city
limits
during
the
last
two
weeks
i
came
upon
the
name
of
one
eva
poindexter
eva
that
was
a
name
in
the
house
on
street
i
decided
to
follow
up
this
eva
a
wise
conclusion
and
how
did
you
set
about
it
why
i
went
directly
to
the
clergyman
who
had
performed
the
ceremony
he
was
a
kind
and
affable
dominie
sir
and
i
had
no
trouble
in
talking
to
him
and
you
described
the
bride
no
i
led
the
conversation
so
that
he
described
her
good
and
what
kind
of
a
woman
did
he
make
her
out
to
be
delicate
pale
sir
he
had
not
read
the
service
for
so
lovely
a
bride
in
years
very
slight
almost
fragile
but
beautiful
and
with
a
delicate
bloom
which
showed
her
to
be
in
better
health
than
one
would
judge
from
her
dainty
figure
it
was
a
private
wedding
sir
celebrated
in
a
hotel
parlor
but
her
father
was
with
her
her
father
gryce
theory
received
its
first
shock
then
the
old
man
who
had
laughed
on
leaving
adams
house
was
not
the
father
to
whom
those
few
lines
in
adams
handwriting
were
addressed
or
this
young
woman
was
not
the
person
referred
to
in
those
lines
is
there
anything
wrong
about
that
inquired
sweetwater
gryce
became
impassive
again
no
i
had
not
expected
his
attendance
at
the
wedding
that
is
all
sorry
sir
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
his
having
been
there
the
bridegroom
yes
tell
me
about
the
bridegroom
was
the
very
man
you
described
to
me
as
leaving
adams
house
with
her
tall
finely
developed
with
a
grand
air
and
gentlemanly
manners
even
his
clothes
correspond
with
what
you
told
me
to
expect
a
checked
suit
brown
in
color
and
of
the
latest
cut
oh
he
is
the
man
gryce
with
a
suddenly
developed
interest
in
the
lid
of
his
inkstand
recalled
the
lines
which
adams
had
written
immediately
before
his
death
and
found
himself
wholly
at
sea
how
reconcile
facts
so
diametrically
opposed
what
allusion
could
there
be
in
these
lines
to
the
bride
of
another
man
they
read
rather
as
if
she
were
his
own
bride
as
witness
i
return
your
daughter
to
you
she
is
here
neither
she
nor
you
will
ever
see
me
again
remember
evelyn
amos
son
there
must
be
something
wrong
sweetwater
must
have
been
led
astray
by
a
series
of
extraordinary
coincidences
dropping
the
lid
of
the
inkstand
in
a
way
to
make
the
young
man
smile
he
looked
up
i
afraid
it
been
a
fool
chase
sweetwater
the
facts
you
relate
in
regard
to
this
couple
the
fact
of
their
having
been
married
at
all
tally
so
little
with
what
we
have
been
led
to
expect
from
certain
other
evidences
which
have
come
in
pardon
me
sir
but
will
you
hear
me
out
at
the
imperial
where
they
were
married
i
learned
that
the
father
and
daughter
had
registered
as
coming
from
a
small
place
in
pennsylvania
but
i
could
learn
nothing
in
regard
to
the
bridegroom
he
had
not
appeared
on
the
scene
till
the
time
for
the
ceremony
and
after
the
marriage
was
seen
to
take
his
bride
away
in
one
carriage
while
the
old
gentleman
departed
in
another
the
latter
concerned
me
little
it
was
the
young
couple
i
had
been
detailed
to
find
employing
the
usual
means
of
search
i
tracked
them
to
the
waldorf
where
i
learned
what
makes
it
certain
that
i
have
been
following
the
right
couple
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
day
of
adams
death
this
young
husband
and
wife
left
the
hotel
on
foot
and
did
not
come
back
their
clothes
which
had
all
been
left
behind
were
taken
away
two
days
later
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
said
he
was
her
father
and
whose
appearance
coincides
with
that
of
the
person
registering
as
such
at
the
imperial
all
of
which
looks
favorable
to
my
theory
does
it
not
especially
when
you
remember
that
the
name
you
have
not
told
it
is
adams
thomas
adams
same
family
as
the
murdered
man
you
see
at
least
he
has
the
same
name
gryce
surveyed
the
young
man
with
admiration
but
was
not
yet
disposed
to
yield
him
entire
credence
humph
i
do
not
wonder
you
thought
it
worth
your
while
to
follow
up
the
pair
if
one
of
them
is
named
adams
and
the
other
eva
but
sweetwater
the
longer
you
serve
on
the
force
the
more
you
will
learn
that
coincidences
as
strange
and
unexpected
as
these
do
occur
at
times
and
must
be
taken
into
account
in
the
elucidation
of
a
difficult
problem
much
as
i
may
regret
to
throw
cold
water
on
your
hopes
there
are
reasons
for
believing
that
the
young
man
and
woman
whom
we
are
seeking
are
not
the
ones
you
have
busied
yourself
about
for
the
last
two
days
certain
facts
which
have
come
to
light
would
seem
to
show
that
if
she
had
a
husband
at
all
his
name
would
not
be
thomas
adams
but
felix
and
as
the
facts
i
have
to
bring
forward
are
most
direct
and
unimpeachable
i
fear
you
will
have
to
start
again
and
on
a
new
tack
but
sweetwater
remained
unshaken
and
eyed
his
superior
with
a
vague
smile
playing
about
his
lips
you
have
not
asked
me
sir
where
i
have
spent
all
the
time
which
has
elapsed
since
i
saw
you
last
the
investigations
i
have
mentioned
did
not
absorb
more
than
a
day
very
true
where
have
you
been
sweetwater
to
montgomery
sir
to
that
small
town
in
pennsylvania
from
which
poindexter
and
his
daughter
registered
ah
i
see
and
what
did
you
learn
there
something
directly
to
the
point
i
learned
this
that
john
poindexter
father
of
eva
had
for
a
friend
in
early
life
one
amos
cadwalader
amos
repeated
gryce
with
an
odd
look
yes
and
that
this
amos
had
a
son
felix
ah
you
see
sir
we
must
be
on
the
right
track
coincidences
can
not
extend
through
half
a
dozen
names
you
are
right
it
is
i
who
have
made
a
mistake
in
drawing
my
conclusions
too
readily
let
us
hear
about
this
amos
you
gathered
something
of
his
history
no
doubt
all
that
was
possible
sir
it
is
closely
woven
in
with
that
of
poindexter
and
presents
one
feature
which
may
occasion
you
no
surprise
but
which
i
own
came
near
nonplussing
me
though
the
father
of
felix
his
name
was
not
adams
i
say
was
not
for
he
has
been
dead
six
months
it
was
cadwalader
and
felix
went
by
the
name
of
cadwalader
too
in
the
early
days
of
which
i
have
to
tell
he
and
a
sister
whose
name
well
was
evelyn
sweetwater
you
are
an
admirable
fellow
so
the
mystery
is
ours
the
history
not
the
mystery
that
still
holds
shall
i
relate
what
i
know
of
those
two
families
at
once
i
am
as
anxious
as
if
i
were
again
and
had
been
in
your
shoes
instead
of
my
own
for
the
last
three
days
very
well
sir
john
poindexter
and
amos
cadwalader
were
in
their
early
life
bosom
friends
they
had
come
from
scotland
together
and
settled
in
montgomery
in
the
thirties
both
married
there
but
john
poindexter
was
a
prosperous
man
from
the
first
while
cadwalader
had
little
ability
to
support
a
family
and
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
when
the
war
of
the
rebellion
broke
out
and
he
enlisted
as
a
soldier
poindexter
remained
at
home
caring
for
his
own
family
and
for
the
two
children
of
cadwalader
whom
he
took
into
his
own
house
i
say
his
own
family
but
he
had
no
family
save
a
wife
up
to
the
spring
of
then
a
daughter
was
born
to
him
the
eva
who
has
just
married
thomas
adams
cadwalader
who
was
fitted
for
army
life
rose
to
be
a
captain
but
he
was
unfortunately
taken
prisoner
at
one
of
the
late
battles
and
confined
in
libby
prison
where
he
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
till
he
was
released
in
by
a
forced
exchange
of
prisoners
broken
old
and
crushed
he
returned
home
and
no
one
living
in
the
town
at
that
time
will
ever
forget
the
day
he
alighted
from
the
cars
and
took
his
way
up
the
main
street
for
not
having
been
fortunate
enough
or
unfortunate
enough
perhaps
to
receive
any
communication
from
home
he
advanced
with
a
cheerful
haste
not
knowing
that
his
only
daughter
then
lay
dead
in
his
friend
house
and
that
it
was
for
her
funeral
that
the
people
were
collecting
in
the
green
square
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
was
so
pale
broken
and
decrepit
that
few
knew
him
but
there
was
one
old
neighbor
who
recognized
him
and
was
kind
enough
to
lead
him
into
a
quiet
place
and
there
tell
him
that
he
had
arrived
just
too
late
to
see
his
darling
daughter
alive
the
shock
instead
of
prostrating
the
old
soldier
seemed
to
nerve
him
afresh
and
put
new
vigor
into
his
limbs
he
proceeded
almost
on
a
run
to
poindexter
house
and
arrived
just
as
the
funeral
cortège
was
issuing
from
the
door
and
now
happened
a
strange
thing
the
young
girl
had
been
laid
on
an
open
bier
and
was
being
carried
by
six
sturdy
lads
to
her
last
resting
place
as
the
father
eye
fell
on
her
young
body
under
its
black
pall
a
cry
of
mortal
anguish
escaped
him
and
he
sank
on
his
knees
right
in
the
line
of
the
procession
at
the
same
minute
another
cry
went
up
this
time
from
behind
the
bier
and
john
poindexter
could
be
seen
reeling
at
the
side
of
felix
cadwalader
who
alone
of
all
present
though
he
was
the
youngest
and
the
least
seemed
to
retain
his
at
this
painful
moment
meanwhile
the
bereaved
father
throwing
himself
at
the
side
of
the
bier
began
tearing
away
at
the
pall
in
his
desire
to
look
upon
the
face
of
her
he
had
left
in
such
rosy
health
four
years
before
but
he
was
stopped
not
by
poindexter
who
had
vanished
from
the
scene
but
by
felix
the
cold
boy
who
stood
like
a
guard
behind
his
sister
reaching
out
a
hand
so
white
it
was
in
itself
a
shock
he
laid
it
in
a
certain
prohibitory
way
on
the
pall
as
if
saying
no
and
when
his
father
would
have
continued
the
struggle
it
was
felix
who
controlled
him
and
gradually
drew
him
into
the
place
at
his
own
side
where
a
minute
before
the
imposing
figure
of
poindexter
had
stood
after
which
the
bearers
took
up
their
burden
again
and
moved
on
but
the
dramatic
scene
was
not
over
as
they
neared
the
churchyard
another
procession
similar
in
appearance
to
their
own
issued
from
an
adjoining
street
and
evelyn
young
lover
who
had
died
almost
simultaneously
with
herself
was
brought
in
and
laid
at
her
side
but
not
in
the
same
grave
this
was
noticed
by
all
though
most
eyes
and
hearts
were
fixed
upon
cadwalader
who
had
escaped
his
loathsome
prison
and
returned
to
the
place
of
his
affections
for
whether
he
grasped
then
and
there
the
full
meaning
of
this
double
burial
young
kissam
had
shot
himself
upon
hearing
of
evelyn
death
or
whether
all
explanations
were
deferred
till
he
and
felix
walked
away
together
from
the
grave
has
never
transpired
from
that
minute
till
they
both
left
town
on
the
following
day
no
one
had
any
word
with
him
save
poindexter
whom
he
went
once
to
see
and
young
kissam
mother
who
came
once
to
see
him
like
a
phantom
he
had
risen
upon
the
sight
of
the
good
people
of
montgomery
and
like
a
phantom
he
disappeared
never
to
be
seen
by
any
of
them
again
unless
as
many
doubt
the
story
is
true
which
was
told
some
twenty
years
ago
by
one
of
the
little
village
lads
he
says
it
was
six
years
after
the
tragic
scene
i
have
just
related
that
one
evening
as
he
was
hurrying
by
the
churchyard
in
great
anxiety
to
reach
home
before
it
was
too
dark
he
came
upon
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
beside
a
grave
with
a
little
child
in
his
arms
this
man
was
tall
and
terrifying
his
attitude
as
the
lad
describes
it
was
one
of
defiance
if
not
of
cursing
high
in
his
right
hand
he
held
the
child
almost
as
if
he
would
hurl
him
at
the
village
which
lies
under
the
hill
on
which
the
churchyard
is
perched
and
though
the
moment
passed
quickly
the
boy
now
a
man
never
has
forgotten
the
picture
thus
presented
or
admitted
that
it
was
anything
but
a
real
one
as
the
description
he
gave
of
this
man
answered
to
the
appearance
of
amos
cadwalader
and
as
the
shoe
of
a
little
child
was
found
next
morning
on
the
grave
of
cadwalader
daughter
evelyn
it
has
been
thought
by
many
that
the
boy
really
beheld
this
old
soldier
who
for
some
mysterious
reason
had
chosen
nightfall
for
this
fleeting
visit
to
his
daughter
but
to
others
it
was
only
a
freak
of
the
lad
imagination
which
had
been
much
influenced
by
the
reading
of
romances
for
as
these
latter
reasoned
had
it
really
been
cadwalader
why
did
he
not
show
himself
at
john
poindexter
house
that
old
friend
who
now
had
a
little
daughter
and
no
wife
and
who
could
have
made
him
so
comfortable
among
these
was
poindexter
himself
though
some
thought
he
looked
oddly
while
making
this
remark
as
if
he
spoke
more
from
custom
than
from
the
heart
indeed
since
the
unfortunate
death
of
evelyn
in
his
house
he
had
never
shown
the
same
interest
in
the
cadwaladers
but
then
he
was
a
man
much
occupied
with
great
affairs
while
the
cadwaladers
except
for
their
many
griefs
and
misfortunes
were
regarded
as
comparatively
insignificant
people
unless
we
except
felix
who
from
his
earliest
childhood
had
made
himself
feared
even
by
grown
people
though
he
never
showed
a
harsh
spirit
or
exceeded
the
bounds
of
decorum
in
speech
or
gesture
a
year
ago
news
came
to
montgomery
of
amos
cadwalader
death
but
no
particulars
concerning
his
family
or
burial
place
and
that
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
glean
concerning
the
cadwaladers
gryce
had
again
become
thoughtful
have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
evelyn
death
was
not
a
natural
one
no
sir
i
interviewed
the
old
mother
of
the
young
man
who
shot
himself
out
of
grief
at
evelyn
approaching
death
and
if
any
doubt
had
existed
concerning
a
matter
which
had
driven
her
son
to
a
violent
end
she
could
not
have
concealed
it
from
me
but
there
seemed
to
have
been
none
evelyn
cadwalader
was
always
of
delicate
health
and
when
a
quick
consumption
carried
her
off
no
one
marvelled
her
lover
who
adored
her
simply
could
not
live
without
her
so
he
shot
himself
there
was
no
mystery
about
the
tragic
occurrence
except
that
it
seemed
to
sever
an
old
friendship
that
once
was
firm
as
a
rock
i
allude
to
that
between
the
poindexters
and
cadwaladers
yet
in
this
tragedy
which
has
just
occurred
in
street
we
see
them
brought
together
again
thomas
adams
marries
eva
poindexter
but
who
is
thomas
adams
you
have
not
mentioned
him
in
this
history
not
unless
he
was
the
child
who
was
held
aloft
over
evelyn
grave
humph
that
seems
rather
what
did
you
learn
about
him
in
montgomery
is
he
known
there
as
well
as
any
stranger
can
be
who
spends
his
time
in
courting
a
young
girl
he
came
to
montgomery
a
few
months
ago
from
some
foreign
city
paris
i
think
and
being
gifted
with
every
personal
charm
calculated
to
please
a
cultivated
young
woman
speedily
won
the
affections
of
eva
poindexter
and
also
the
esteem
of
her
father
but
their
favorable
opinion
is
not
shared
by
every
one
in
the
town
there
are
those
who
have
a
good
deal
to
say
about
his
anxious
and
unsettled
eye
naturally
he
could
not
marry
all
their
daughters
but
this
history
you
have
given
me
it
is
meagre
sweetwater
and
while
it
hints
at
something
deeply
tragic
does
not
supply
the
key
we
want
a
girl
who
died
some
thirty
years
ago
a
father
who
disappeared
a
brother
who
from
being
a
cadwalader
has
become
an
adams
an
eva
whose
name
as
well
as
that
of
the
evelyn
was
to
be
heard
in
constant
repetition
in
the
place
where
the
murdered
felix
lay
with
those
inscrutable
lines
in
his
own
writing
clinched
between
his
teeth
it
is
a
snarl
a
perfect
snarl
of
which
we
have
as
yet
failed
to
pull
the
right
thread
but
we
get
hold
of
it
yet
i
not
going
to
be
baffled
in
my
old
age
by
difficulties
i
would
have
laughed
at
a
dozen
years
ago
but
this
right
thread
how
shall
we
know
it
among
the
fifty
i
see
entangled
in
this
matter
first
find
the
whereabouts
of
this
young
couple
but
did
you
tell
me
you
had
done
so
that
you
know
where
they
are
yes
i
learned
from
the
postmaster
in
montgomery
that
a
letter
addressed
to
thomas
adams
had
been
sent
from
his
to
belleville
long
island
ah
i
know
that
place
and
wishing
to
be
assured
that
the
letter
was
not
a
pretense
i
sent
a
telegram
to
the
postmaster
at
belleville
here
is
his
answer
it
is
unequivocal
poindexter
of
montgomery
thomas
adams
and
adams
of
the
same
place
have
been
at
the
bedell
house
in
this
place
five
days
very
good
then
we
have
them
be
ready
to
start
for
belleville
by
one
sharp
and
mind
sweetwater
keep
your
wits
alert
and
your
tongue
still
remember
that
as
yet
we
are
feeling
our
way
blindfold
and
must
continue
to
do
so
till
some
kind
hand
tears
away
the
bandage
from
our
eyes
go
i
have
a
letter
to
write
for
which
you
may
send
in
a
boy
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
this
letter
was
for
miss
butterworth
and
created
a
later
quite
a
stir
in
the
fine
old
mansion
in
gramercy
park
it
ran
thus
have
you
sufficient
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
certain
matter
to
take
a
short
journey
into
the
country
i
leave
town
at
for
belleville
long
island
if
you
choose
to
do
the
same
you
will
find
me
at
the
bedell
house
in
that
town
early
in
the
afternoon
if
you
enjoy
novels
take
one
with
you
and
let
me
see
you
reading
it
on
the
hotel
piazza
at
five
i
may
be
reading
too
if
so
and
my
choice
is
a
book
all
is
well
and
you
may
devour
your
story
in
peace
but
if
i
lay
aside
my
book
and
take
up
a
paper
devote
but
one
eye
to
your
story
and
turn
the
other
on
the
people
who
are
passing
you
if
after
you
have
done
so
you
leave
your
book
open
i
shall
understand
that
you
fail
to
recognize
these
persons
but
if
you
shut
the
volume
you
may
expect
to
see
me
also
fold
up
my
newspaper
for
by
so
doing
you
will
have
signaled
me
that
you
have
identified
the
young
man
and
woman
you
saw
leaving
adams
house
on
the
fatal
afternoon
of
your
first
entrance
chapter
xi
misery
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
lady
of
uncertain
age
who
was
to
be
seen
late
that
afternoon
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
hotel
piazza
at
belleville
had
not
chosen
a
tale
requiring
great
concentration
of
mind
for
her
eyes
rather
fine
ones
in
their
way
showing
both
keenness
and
good
nature
seemed
to
find
more
to
interest
them
in
the
scene
before
her
than
in
the
pages
she
so
industriously
turned
over
the
scene
was
one
calculated
to
interest
an
idle
mind
no
doubt
first
there
was
the
sea
a
wide
expanse
of
blue
dotted
by
numerous
sails
then
the
beach
enlivened
by
groups
of
young
people
dressed
like
popinjays
in
every
color
then
the
village
street
and
lastly
a
lawn
over
which
there
now
and
then
strayed
young
couples
with
tennis
rackets
in
their
hands
or
golf
sticks
under
their
arms
children
too
but
children
did
not
seem
to
interest
this
amiable
spinster
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
her
being
a
spinster
she
scarcely
glanced
at
them
twice
while
a
young
married
pair
or
even
an
old
gentleman
if
he
were
only
tall
and
invariably
caused
her
eyes
to
wander
from
her
book
which
by
the
way
she
held
too
near
for
seeing
or
such
might
have
been
the
criticism
of
a
wary
observer
this
criticism
if
criticism
it
would
be
called
could
not
have
been
made
of
the
spruce
but
rather
feeble
octogenarian
at
the
other
end
of
the
piazza
he
was
evidently
absorbed
in
the
novel
he
held
so
conspicuously
open
and
which
from
the
smiles
now
and
then
disturbing
the
usual
placidity
of
his
benevolent
features
we
can
take
for
granted
was
sufficiently
amusing
yet
right
in
the
midst
of
it
and
certainly
before
he
had
finished
his
chapter
he
closed
his
book
and
took
out
a
newspaper
which
he
opened
to
its
full
width
before
sitting
down
to
peruse
its
columns
at
the
same
moment
the
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
piazza
could
be
seen
looking
over
her
spectacles
at
two
gentlemen
who
just
at
that
moment
issued
from
the
great
door
opening
between
her
and
the
elderly
person
just
alluded
to
did
she
know
them
or
was
it
only
her
curiosity
that
was
aroused
from
the
way
she
banged
together
her
book
and
rose
it
looked
as
if
she
had
detected
old
acquaintances
in
the
pair
who
were
now
advancing
slowly
toward
her
but
if
so
she
could
not
have
been
overjoyed
to
see
them
for
after
the
first
hint
of
their
approach
in
her
direction
she
turned
with
an
aspect
of
some
embarrassment
and
made
her
way
out
upon
the
lawn
where
she
stood
with
her
back
to
these
people
caressing
a
small
dog
in
a
way
that
betrayed
her
total
lack
of
sympathy
with
these
animals
which
were
evidently
her
terror
when
she
was
sufficiently
herself
to
be
swayed
by
her
natural
impulses
the
two
gentlemen
on
the
contrary
with
an
air
of
total
indifference
to
her
proximity
continued
their
walk
until
they
reached
the
end
of
the
piazza
and
then
turned
and
proceeded
mechanically
to
retrace
their
steps
their
faces
now
being
brought
within
view
of
the
elderly
person
who
was
so
absorbed
in
his
newspaper
the
latter
shifted
that
sheet
the
merest
trifle
possibly
because
the
sun
struck
his
eyes
too
directly
possibly
because
he
wished
to
catch
sight
of
two
very
remarkable
men
if
so
the
opportunity
was
good
as
they
stopped
within
a
few
feet
of
his
chair
one
of
them
was
elderly
as
old
as
if
not
older
than
the
man
watching
him
but
he
was
of
that
famous
scotch
stock
whose
members
are
tough
and
hale
at
eighty
this
toughness
he
showed
not
only
in
his
figure
which
was
both
upright
and
graceful
but
in
the
glance
of
his
calm
cold
eye
which
fell
upon
everybody
and
everything
unmoved
while
that
of
his
young
but
equally
stalwart
companion
seemed
to
shrink
with
the
most
acute
sensitiveness
from
every
person
he
met
save
the
very
mild
old
reader
of
news
near
whom
they
now
paused
for
a
words
of
conversation
i
do
think
it
does
me
any
good
was
the
young
man
gloomy
remark
i
am
wretched
when
with
her
and
doubly
wretched
when
i
try
to
forget
myself
for
a
moment
out
of
her
sight
i
think
we
had
better
go
back
i
had
rather
sit
where
she
can
see
me
than
have
her
wonder
oh
i
will
be
careful
but
you
must
remember
how
unnerving
is
the
very
silence
i
am
obliged
to
keep
about
what
is
destroying
us
all
i
am
nearly
as
ill
as
she
here
they
drew
off
and
their
apparently
disinterested
hearer
turned
the
page
of
his
paper
it
was
five
minutes
before
they
came
back
this
time
it
was
the
old
gentleman
who
was
speaking
and
as
he
was
more
discreet
than
his
companion
or
less
under
the
influence
of
his
feelings
his
voice
was
lower
and
his
words
less
easy
to
be
distinguished
escape
south
coast
she
will
forget
to
watch
you
for
a
clinging
nature
impetuous
but
foolishly
affectionate
you
know
that
no
danger
found
out
time
a
cheerful
home
courage
happiness
all
forgotten
a
gesture
from
the
young
man
as
he
moved
away
showed
that
he
did
not
share
these
hopes
meanwhile
miss
butterworth
you
surely
have
recognized
miss
butterworth
had
her
opportunities
too
she
was
still
stooping
over
the
dog
which
wriggled
under
her
hand
yet
did
not
offer
to
run
away
fascinated
perhaps
by
that
hesitating
touch
which
he
may
or
may
not
have
known
had
never
inflicted
itself
upon
a
dog
before
but
her
ears
and
attention
were
turned
toward
two
girls
chatting
on
a
bench
near
her
as
freely
as
if
they
were
quite
alone
on
the
lawn
they
were
gossiping
about
a
of
the
big
hotel
and
miss
butterworth
listened
intently
after
hearing
them
mention
the
name
adams
these
are
some
of
the
words
she
caught
but
she
is
i
tell
you
she
is
sick
enough
to
have
a
nurse
and
a
doctor
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
as
i
was
going
by
her
room
yesterday
and
i
never
saw
two
such
big
eyes
or
such
pale
cheeks
then
look
at
him
he
must
just
adore
her
for
he
wo
speak
to
another
woman
and
just
moves
about
in
that
small
hot
room
all
day
i
wonder
if
they
are
bride
and
groom
they
are
young
enough
and
if
you
have
noticed
her
clothes
oh
do
talk
about
clothes
i
saw
her
the
first
day
she
came
and
was
the
victim
of
despair
until
she
suddenly
got
sick
and
so
could
wear
those
wonderful
waists
and
jackets
i
felt
like
a
dowdy
when
i
saw
that
pale
blue
oh
well
blue
becomes
blondes
you
would
look
like
a
fright
in
it
i
did
care
about
her
clothes
but
i
did
feel
that
it
was
all
up
with
us
if
she
chose
to
talk
or
even
to
smile
upon
the
few
men
that
are
good
enough
to
stay
out
a
week
in
this
place
yet
she
is
a
beauty
she
has
not
a
good
nose
nor
a
handsome
eye
nor
even
an
irreproachable
complexion
it
must
be
her
mouth
which
is
lovely
or
her
walk
did
you
notice
her
walk
it
was
just
as
if
she
were
floating
that
is
before
she
fell
down
in
that
faint
i
wonder
why
she
fainted
nobody
was
doing
anything
not
even
her
husband
but
perhaps
that
was
what
troubled
her
i
noticed
that
for
some
cause
he
was
looking
very
serious
and
when
she
had
tried
to
attract
his
attention
two
or
three
times
and
failed
she
just
fell
from
her
chair
to
the
floor
that
roused
him
he
has
hardly
left
her
since
i
do
think
they
look
very
happy
do
you
for
so
rich
and
handsome
a
couple
perhaps
he
is
dissipated
i
have
noticed
that
the
old
gentleman
never
leaves
them
well
well
he
may
be
dissipated
handsome
men
are
very
apt
to
be
but
i
would
care
if
here
the
dog
gave
a
yelp
and
bolted
miss
butterworth
had
unconsciously
pinched
him
in
her
indignation
possibly
at
the
turn
these
young
ladies
conversation
was
taking
this
made
a
diversion
and
the
young
girls
moved
off
leaving
miss
butterworth
without
occupation
but
a
young
man
who
at
that
moment
crossed
her
path
gave
her
enough
to
think
about
you
recognize
them
there
is
no
mistake
he
whispered
none
the
one
this
way
is
the
young
man
i
saw
leave
adams
house
and
the
other
is
the
old
gentleman
who
came
in
afterward
gryce
advises
you
to
return
home
he
is
going
to
arrest
the
young
man
and
sweetwater
passed
on
miss
butterworth
strolled
to
a
seat
and
sat
down
she
felt
weak
she
seemed
to
see
that
young
wife
sick
overwhelmed
struggling
with
her
great
fear
sink
under
this
crushing
blow
with
no
woman
near
her
capable
of
affording
the
least
sympathy
the
father
did
not
impress
her
as
being
the
man
to
hold
up
her
fainting
head
or
ease
her
bruised
heart
he
had
an
icy
look
under
his
polished
exterior
which
repelled
this
spinster
and
as
she
remembered
the
coldness
of
his
ways
she
felt
herself
seized
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
be
near
this
young
creature
when
the
blow
fell
if
only
to
ease
the
tension
of
her
own
heartstrings
which
at
that
moment
ached
keenly
over
the
part
she
had
felt
herself
obliged
to
play
in
this
matter
but
when
she
rose
to
look
for
gryce
she
found
him
gone
and
upon
searching
the
piazza
for
the
other
two
gentlemen
she
saw
them
just
vanishing
round
the
corner
in
the
direction
of
a
small
as
she
could
not
follow
them
she
went
upstairs
and
meeting
a
maid
in
the
upper
hall
asked
for
adams
she
was
told
that
adams
was
sick
but
was
shown
the
door
of
her
room
which
was
at
the
end
of
a
long
hall
as
all
the
halls
terminated
in
a
window
under
which
a
sofa
was
to
be
found
she
felt
that
circumstances
were
in
her
favor
and
took
her
seat
upon
the
sofa
before
her
in
a
state
of
great
complacency
instantly
a
sweet
voice
was
heard
through
the
open
transom
of
the
door
behind
which
her
thoughts
were
already
concentrated
where
is
tom
oh
where
is
tom
why
does
he
leave
me
i
afraid
of
what
he
may
be
tempted
to
do
or
say
down
on
those
great
piazzas
alone
poindexter
is
with
him
answered
a
voice
measured
but
kind
adams
was
getting
very
tired
and
your
father
persuaded
him
to
go
down
and
have
a
smoke
i
must
get
up
indeed
i
must
get
up
oh
the
camphor
the
there
was
a
bustle
this
poor
young
wife
had
evidently
fainted
again
miss
butterworth
cast
very
miserable
glances
at
the
door
meanwhile
in
that
small
and
retired
a
terrible
scene
was
in
progress
the
two
gentlemen
had
lit
their
cigars
and
were
sitting
in
certain
forced
attitudes
that
evinced
their
of
the
weed
each
had
taken
out
of
complaisance
to
the
other
when
an
old
man
strangely
serious
strangely
at
home
yet
as
strangely
a
guest
of
the
house
like
themselves
came
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
gentlemen
he
at
once
announced
i
am
detective
gryce
of
the
new
york
police
and
i
am
here
but
i
see
that
one
of
you
at
least
knows
why
i
am
here
one
both
of
them
this
was
evident
in
a
moment
no
denial
no
subterfuge
was
possible
at
the
first
word
uttered
in
the
strange
authoritative
tone
which
old
detectives
acquire
after
years
of
such
experiences
the
young
man
sank
down
in
sudden
collapse
while
his
companion
without
yielding
so
entirely
to
his
emotions
showed
that
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
blow
which
in
one
moment
had
brought
destruction
to
all
their
hopes
when
gryce
saw
himself
so
completely
understood
he
no
longer
hesitated
over
his
duty
directing
his
full
attention
to
adams
he
said
this
time
with
some
feeling
for
the
misery
of
this
young
man
had
impressed
him
you
are
wanted
in
new
york
by
coroner
d
whose
business
it
is
to
hold
an
inquest
over
the
remains
of
felix
adams
of
whose
astonishing
death
you
are
undoubtedly
informed
as
you
and
your
wife
were
seen
leaving
that
gentleman
house
a
few
minutes
before
he
expired
you
are
naturally
regarded
as
valuable
witnesses
in
determining
whether
his
death
was
one
of
suicide
or
murder
it
was
an
accusation
or
so
nearly
one
that
gryce
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
behold
the
dark
flush
of
shame
displace
the
livid
terror
which
but
an
instant
before
had
made
the
man
before
him
look
like
one
of
those
lost
spirits
we
sometimes
imagine
as
flitting
across
the
open
mouth
of
hell
but
he
said
nothing
seemingly
had
no
power
to
do
so
and
his
was
about
to
make
some
effort
to
turn
aside
this
blow
when
a
voice
in
the
hall
outside
was
heard
inquiring
for
adams
saying
that
his
wife
had
fainted
again
and
required
his
help
the
young
husband
started
cast
a
look
full
of
despair
at
poindexter
and
thrusting
his
hand
against
the
door
as
if
to
hold
it
shut
sank
on
his
knees
before
gryce
saying
she
knows
she
suspects
her
nature
is
so
sensitive
this
he
managed
to
utter
in
gasps
as
the
detective
bent
compassionately
over
him
do
do
disturb
her
she
is
an
angel
a
saint
from
heaven
let
me
bear
the
blame
he
was
my
brother
let
me
go
with
you
but
leave
her
in
ignorance
gryce
with
a
vivid
sense
of
justice
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
say
nothing
he
enjoined
my
memory
is
good
and
i
would
rather
hear
nothing
from
your
lips
as
for
your
wife
my
warrant
does
in
no
way
include
her
and
if
you
promise
to
come
with
me
quietly
i
will
even
let
you
bid
her
adieu
so
that
you
do
it
in
my
presence
the
change
which
passed
over
the
young
man
face
at
these
significant
words
was
of
a
nature
to
surprise
gryce
rising
slowly
he
took
his
stand
by
poindexter
who
true
to
his
inflexible
nature
had
scarcely
moved
in
limb
and
feature
since
gryce
came
in
what
have
you
against
me
he
demanded
and
there
was
a
surprising
ring
to
his
voice
as
if
courage
had
come
with
the
necessity
of
the
moment
of
what
am
i
accused
i
want
you
to
tell
me
i
had
rather
you
would
tell
me
in
so
many
words
i
can
not
leave
in
peace
until
you
do
poindexter
made
a
movement
at
this
and
cast
a
glance
at
his
but
the
young
man
took
no
notice
of
his
interference
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
detective
who
quietly
took
out
his
warrant
at
this
instant
the
door
shook
lock
it
was
the
hoarse
command
of
the
accused
man
do
let
any
one
pass
that
door
even
if
it
is
to
bring
the
tidings
of
my
wife
death
gryce
reached
out
his
hand
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
young
adams
opened
the
paper
which
he
had
taken
from
the
detective
hand
and
while
his
eyes
vainly
sought
to
master
the
few
lines
there
written
poindexter
attracted
the
attention
of
gryce
and
fixing
him
with
his
eye
formed
his
lips
with
three
soundless
words
for
murder
him
the
detective
bow
and
a
very
sigh
from
his
answered
him
simultaneously
with
a
curious
lift
of
his
upper
lip
which
showed
his
teeth
somewhat
unpleasantly
for
a
moment
he
drew
back
a
step
and
sank
into
his
previous
immobility
i
am
indebted
to
you
declared
the
young
man
now
i
know
where
i
stand
i
am
quite
ready
to
go
with
you
and
stand
trial
if
such
be
deemed
necessary
by
the
officials
in
new
york
you
he
cried
turning
with
almost
an
air
of
command
to
the
old
gentleman
beside
him
will
watch
over
eva
not
like
a
father
sir
but
like
a
mother
you
will
be
at
her
side
when
she
wakes
and
if
possible
leave
her
only
when
she
sleeps
do
not
let
her
suffer
not
too
much
no
newspapers
no
gossiping
women
watch
watch
as
i
would
watch
and
when
i
come
back
for
i
will
come
back
will
i
not
he
appealed
to
gryce
my
prayers
will
bless
you
and
a
sob
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
turned
for
a
minute
aside
then
he
took
the
detective
arm
quite
calmly
and
remarked
i
do
not
want
to
say
to
my
wife
i
can
not
bear
it
i
had
rather
go
straight
from
here
without
another
glance
at
her
unconscious
face
when
i
have
told
my
story
for
i
shall
tell
it
to
the
first
man
who
asks
me
i
may
find
courage
to
write
her
meanwhile
get
me
away
as
quickly
as
you
can
time
enough
for
the
world
to
know
my
shame
gryce
tapped
on
the
window
overlooking
the
piazza
a
young
man
stepped
in
here
is
a
gentleman
he
cried
who
finds
himself
forced
to
return
in
great
haste
to
new
york
see
that
he
gets
to
the
train
in
time
without
fuss
and
without
raising
the
least
comment
i
will
follow
with
his
portmanteau
poindexter
you
are
now
at
liberty
to
attend
your
suffering
daughter
and
with
a
turn
of
the
key
he
unlocked
the
door
and
one
of
the
most
painful
scenes
of
his
long
life
was
over
chapter
xii
thomas
explains
gryce
was
not
above
employing
a
little
finesse
he
had
expressed
his
intention
of
following
adams
and
he
did
follow
him
but
so
immediately
that
he
not
only
took
the
same
train
but
sat
in
the
same
car
he
wished
to
note
at
his
leisure
the
bearing
of
this
young
man
who
interested
him
in
quite
a
different
way
from
what
he
had
anticipated
a
way
that
vaguely
touched
his
own
conscience
and
made
him
feel
his
years
as
he
had
no
right
to
feel
them
when
he
had
just
brought
to
an
end
an
intricate
and
difficult
pursuit
seated
at
a
distance
he
watched
with
increasing
interest
the
changes
which
passed
over
his
prisoner
handsome
countenance
he
noted
the
calmness
which
now
marked
the
features
he
had
so
lately
seen
writhing
in
deepest
agony
and
wondered
from
what
source
the
strength
came
which
enabled
this
young
man
to
sit
so
stoically
under
the
eyes
of
people
from
whose
regard
an
hour
before
he
had
shrunk
with
such
apparent
suffering
was
it
that
courage
comes
with
despair
or
was
he
too
absorbed
in
his
own
misery
to
note
the
shadow
it
cast
about
him
his
brooding
brow
and
vacant
eye
spoke
of
a
mind
withdrawn
from
present
surroundings
into
what
depths
of
remorse
who
could
say
certainly
not
this
old
detective
seasoned
though
he
was
by
lifelong
contact
with
criminals
some
of
them
of
the
same
social
standing
and
cultured
aspect
as
this
young
man
at
the
station
in
brooklyn
he
rejoined
his
prisoner
who
scarcely
looked
up
as
he
approached
in
another
hour
they
were
at
police
headquarters
and
the
serious
questioning
of
adams
had
begun
he
did
not
attempt
to
shirk
it
indeed
he
seemed
anxious
to
talk
he
had
a
burden
on
his
mind
and
longed
to
throw
it
off
but
the
burden
was
not
of
the
exact
nature
anticipated
by
the
police
he
did
not
acknowledge
having
killed
his
brother
but
confessed
to
having
been
the
incidental
cause
of
that
brother
death
the
story
he
told
was
this
my
name
is
cadwalader
not
adams
my
father
a
scotchman
by
birth
was
a
naturalized
citizen
of
pennsylvania
having
settled
in
a
place
called
montgomery
when
a
young
married
man
he
had
two
children
then
one
of
whom
died
in
early
life
the
other
was
my
brother
felix
whose
violent
death
under
the
name
of
adams
you
have
called
me
here
to
explain
i
am
the
fruit
of
a
later
marriage
entered
into
by
my
father
some
years
after
leaving
montgomery
when
i
was
born
he
was
living
in
harrisburg
but
as
he
left
there
shortly
after
i
had
reached
my
third
year
i
have
no
remembrances
connected
with
that
city
indeed
my
recollections
are
all
of
very
different
scenes
than
this
country
affords
my
mother
having
died
while
i
was
still
an
infant
i
was
sent
very
early
in
life
to
the
old
world
from
which
my
father
had
originally
come
when
i
returned
which
was
not
till
this
very
year
i
found
my
father
dying
and
my
brother
a
grown
man
with
money
a
great
deal
of
money
which
i
had
been
led
to
think
he
was
ready
to
share
with
me
but
after
my
father
was
laid
away
felix
with
what
effort
he
uttered
that
name
felix
came
to
new
york
and
i
was
left
to
wander
about
without
settled
hopes
or
any
definite
promise
of
means
upon
which
to
base
a
future
or
start
a
career
while
wandering
i
came
upon
the
town
where
my
father
had
lived
in
early
youth
and
hunting
up
his
old
friends
i
met
in
the
house
of
one
who
had
come
over
from
scotland
with
my
father
a
young
lady
how
his
voice
shook
and
with
what
a
poignant
accent
he
uttered
that
beloved
name
in
whom
i
speedily
became
interested
to
the
point
of
wishing
to
marry
her
but
i
had
no
money
no
business
no
home
to
give
her
and
as
i
was
fain
to
acknowledge
no
prospects
still
i
could
not
give
up
the
hope
of
making
her
my
wife
so
i
wrote
to
my
brother
felix
cadwalader
or
rather
felix
adams
as
he
preferred
to
be
called
in
later
years
for
family
reasons
entirely
disconnected
with
the
matter
of
his
sudden
demise
and
telling
him
i
had
become
interested
in
a
young
girl
of
good
family
and
some
wealth
asked
him
to
settle
upon
me
a
certain
sum
which
would
enable
me
to
marry
her
with
some
feeling
of
my
only
answer
was
a
repetition
of
the
vague
promise
he
had
thrown
out
before
but
youth
is
hopeful
even
to
daring
and
i
decided
to
make
her
mine
without
further
parley
in
the
hope
that
her
beauty
and
endearing
qualities
would
win
from
him
at
first
view
the
definite
concession
he
had
so
persistently
denied
me
this
i
did
and
the
fault
with
which
i
have
most
to
reproach
myself
is
that
i
entered
into
this
alliance
without
taking
her
or
her
father
into
my
confidence
they
thought
me
well
off
possibly
rich
and
while
poindexter
is
a
man
of
means
i
am
sure
if
he
had
known
i
had
nothing
but
the
clothes
i
wore
and
the
merest
trifle
in
the
way
of
pocket
money
he
would
have
cried
halt
to
the
marriage
for
he
is
a
very
ambitious
man
and
considers
his
daughter
well
worth
a
millionaire
devotion
as
she
is
felix
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
show
no
affection
for
my
brother
he
was
a
very
strange
man
was
notified
of
my
marriage
but
did
not
choose
to
witness
it
neither
did
he
choose
to
prohibit
it
so
it
was
conducted
quietly
with
strangers
for
witnesses
in
a
hotel
parlor
then
with
vague
hopes
as
well
as
certain
vague
fears
i
prepared
to
take
my
young
bride
into
the
presence
of
my
brother
who
hardened
as
he
was
by
years
of
bachelorhood
could
not
be
so
entirely
impervious
to
feminine
charms
as
not
to
recognize
my
wife
as
a
woman
deserving
of
every
consideration
but
i
had
counted
without
my
host
when
two
days
after
the
ceremony
which
had
made
us
one
i
took
her
to
the
house
which
has
since
become
so
unhappily
notorious
i
found
that
my
brother
had
but
shown
me
one
facet
and
that
the
least
obdurate
of
his
nature
brilliant
as
steel
he
was
as
hard
and
not
only
professed
himself
unmoved
by
my
wife
many
charms
but
also
as
totally
out
of
sympathy
with
such
follies
as
love
and
marriage
which
were
he
said
the
fruit
of
unoccupied
minds
and
a
pastime
wholly
unworthy
of
men
boasting
of
such
talents
and
attainments
as
ourselves
then
he
turned
his
back
upon
us
and
i
moved
by
an
anger
little
short
of
frenzy
began
an
abuse
for
which
he
was
so
little
prepared
that
he
crouched
like
a
man
under
blows
and
losing
minute
by
minute
his
finally
caught
up
a
dagger
lying
close
at
hand
and
crying
want
my
money
well
then
take
it
stabbed
himself
to
the
heart
with
one
desperate
blow
i
fear
i
shall
not
be
believed
but
that
is
the
story
of
this
crime
gentlemen
chapter
xiii
despair
was
it
tragedies
as
unpremeditated
as
this
had
doubtless
occurred
and
inconsistencies
in
character
shown
themselves
in
similar
impetuosities
from
the
beginning
of
time
up
till
now
yet
there
was
not
a
man
present
with
or
without
the
memory
of
bartow
pantomime
which
as
you
will
recall
did
not
tally
at
all
with
this
account
of
adams
violent
end
who
did
not
show
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
his
distrust
and
evident
disbelief
in
this
tale
poured
out
with
such
volubility
before
them
the
young
man
gifted
as
he
was
with
the
keenest
susceptibilities
perceived
this
and
his
head
drooped
i
shall
add
nothing
to
and
take
nothing
from
what
i
have
said
was
his
dogged
remark
make
of
it
what
you
will

inspector
who
was
conducting
the
inquiry
glanced
dubiously
at
gryce
as
these
words
left
thomas
adams
lips
whereupon
the
detective
said
we
are
sorry
you
have
taken
such
a
resolution
there
are
many
things
yet
left
to
be
explained
adams
for
instance
why
if
your
brother
slew
himself
in
this
unforeseen
manner
you
left
the
house
so
precipitately
without
giving
an
alarm
or
even
proclaiming
your
relationship
to
him
you
need
not
answer
you
know
the
inspector
voice
broke
in
no
man
is
called
upon
to
incriminate
himself
in
this
free
and
independent
country
a
smile
the
saddest
ever
seen
wandered
for
a
minute
over
the
prisoner
pallid
lips
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
replied
with
a
certain
air
of
desperation
incrimination
is
not
what
i
fear
now
from
the
way
you
all
look
at
me
i
perceive
that
i
am
lost
for
i
have
no
means
of
proving
my
story
this
acknowledgment
which
might
pass
for
the
despairing
cry
of
an
innocent
man
made
his
interrogator
stare
you
forget
suggested
that
gentleman
that
you
had
your
wife
with
you
she
can
corroborate
your
words
and
will
prove
herself
no
doubt
an
invaluable
witness
in
your
favor
my
wife
he
repeated
choking
so
that
his
words
could
be
barely
understood
must
she
be
dragged
into
this
so
sick
so
weak
a
woman
it
would
kill
her
sir
she
loves
me
she
was
she
with
you
in
adams
study
did
she
see
him
lift
the
dagger
against
his
own
breast
no
and
with
this
denial
the
young
man
seemed
to
take
new
courage
she
had
fainted
several
moments
previously
while
the
altercation
between
my
brother
and
myself
was
at
its
height
she
did
not
see
the
final
act
and
gentlemen
i
might
as
well
speak
the
truth
i
have
nothing
to
gain
by
silence
she
finds
it
as
difficult
as
you
do
to
believe
that
adams
struck
himself
i
i
have
tried
with
all
my
arts
to
impress
the
truth
upon
her
but
oh
what
can
i
hope
from
the
world
when
the
wife
of
my
bosom
an
angel
too
who
loves
me
oh
sirs
she
can
never
be
a
witness
for
me
she
is
too
conscientious
too
true
to
her
own
convictions
i
should
lose
she
would
die
gryce
tried
to
stop
him
he
would
not
be
stopped
spare
me
sirs
spare
my
wife
write
me
down
guilty
anything
you
please
rather
than
force
that
young
creature
to
speak
here
the
inspector
cut
short
these
appeals
which
were
rending
every
heart
present
have
you
read
the
newspapers
for
the
last
few
days
he
asked
i
yes
yes
sir
how
could
i
help
it
blood
is
blood
the
man
was
my
brother
i
had
left
him
dying
i
was
naturally
anxious
naturally
saw
my
own
danger
and
i
read
them
of
course
then
you
know
he
was
found
with
a
large
cross
on
his
breast
a
cross
which
was
once
on
the
wall
how
came
it
to
be
torn
down
who
put
it
on
his
bosom
i
sir
i
am
not
a
catholic
but
felix
was
and
seeing
him
dying
without
absolution
without
extreme
unction
i
thought
of
the
holy
cross
and
tore
down
the
only
one
i
saw
and
placed
it
in
his
arms
a
pious
act
did
he
recognize
it
i
can
not
say
i
had
my
fainting
wife
to
look
after
she
occupied
all
my
thoughts
i
see
and
you
carried
her
out
and
were
so
absorbed
in
caring
for
her
you
did
not
observe
adams
valet
he
innocent
sir
whatever
people
may
think
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
crime
you
did
not
observe
him
i
say
standing
in
the
doorway
and
watching
you
now
the
inspector
knew
that
bartow
had
not
been
standing
there
but
at
the
loophole
above
but
the
opportunity
for
entrapping
the
witness
was
too
good
to
lose
adams
was
caught
in
the
trap
or
so
one
might
judge
from
the
beads
of
perspiration
which
at
that
moment
showed
themselves
on
his
pale
forehead
but
he
struggled
to
maintain
the
stand
he
had
taken
crying
hotly
but
that
man
is
crazy
and
besides
or
so
the
papers
give
out
surely
his
testimony
is
valueless
you
would
not
confront
me
with
him
we
confront
you
with
no
one
we
only
asked
you
a
question
you
did
not
observe
the
valet
then
no
sir
or
understand
the
mystery
of
the
colored
lights
no
sir
or
of
the
plate
of
steel
and
the
other
contrivances
with
which
your
brother
enlivened
his
solitude
i
do
not
follow
you
sir
but
there
was
a
change
in
his
tone
i
see
said
the
inspector
that
the
complications
which
have
disturbed
us
and
made
necessary
this
long
delay
in
the
collection
of
testimony
have
not
entered
into
the
crime
as
described
by
you
now
this
is
possible
but
there
is
still
a
circumstance
requiring
explanation
a
little
circumstance
which
is
nevertheless
one
of
importance
since
your
wife
mentioned
it
to
you
as
soon
as
she
became
conscious
i
allude
to
the
half
dozen
or
more
words
which
were
written
by
your
brother
immediately
preceding
his
death
the
paper
on
which
they
were
written
has
been
found
and
that
it
was
a
factor
in
your
quarrel
is
evident
since
she
regretted
that
it
had
been
left
behind
you
and
he
do
you
know
where
we
found
this
paper
the
eyes
which
young
adams
raised
at
this
interrogatory
had
no
intelligence
in
them
the
sight
of
this
morsel
of
paper
seemed
to
have
deprived
him
in
an
instant
of
all
the
faculties
with
which
he
had
been
carrying
on
this
unequal
struggle
he
shook
his
head
tried
to
reach
out
his
hand
but
failed
to
grasp
the
scrap
of
paper
which
the
inspector
held
out
then
he
burst
into
a
loud
cry
enough
i
can
not
hold
out
with
no
other
support
than
a
wicked
lie
i
killed
my
brother
for
reasons
good
as
any
man
ever
had
for
killing
another
but
i
shall
not
impart
them
i
would
rather
be
tried
for
murder
and
hanged
it
was
a
complete
breakdown
pitiful
from
its
contrast
with
the
herculean
physique
and
fine
if
contracted
features
if
the
end
it
was
a
sad
end
and
gryce
whose
forehead
had
taken
on
a
deep
line
between
the
eyebrows
slowly
rose
and
took
his
stand
by
the
young
man
who
looked
ready
to
fall
the
inspector
on
the
contrary
did
not
move
he
had
begun
a
tattoo
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
seemed
bound
to
beat
it
out
when
another
sudden
cry
broke
from
the
young
man
lips
what
is
that
he
demanded
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
and
his
whole
frame
shaking
violently
nothing
began
the
inspector
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
white
as
a
wraith
and
wonderful
with
a
sort
of
holy
passion
darted
from
the
grasp
of
a
man
who
sought
to
detain
her
and
stood
before
them
palpitating
with
a
protest
which
for
a
moment
she
seemed
powerless
to
utter
it
was
adams
young
invalid
wife
whom
he
had
left
three
hours
before
at
belleville
she
was
so
frail
of
form
so
exquisite
of
feature
that
she
would
have
seemed
some
unearthly
visitant
but
for
the
human
anguish
which
pervaded
her
look
and
soon
found
vent
in
this
touching
cry
what
is
he
saying
oh
i
know
well
what
he
is
saying
he
is
saying
that
he
killed
his
brother
that
he
held
the
dagger
which
rid
the
world
of
a
monster
of
whose
wickedness
none
knew
but
you
must
not
heed
him
indeed
you
must
not
heed
him
he
is
innocent
i
his
wife
have
come
twenty
miles
from
a
bed
of
weakness
and
suffering
to
tell
you
so
he
but
here
a
hand
was
laid
gently
but
firmly
on
her
mouth
she
looked
up
met
her
husband
eyes
filled
with
almost
frantic
appeal
and
giving
him
a
look
in
return
that
sank
into
the
heart
of
every
man
who
beheld
it
laid
her
own
hand
on
his
and
drew
it
softly
away
it
is
too
late
tom
i
must
speak
my
father
my
own
weakness
or
your
own
peremptory
commands
could
not
keep
me
at
belleville
when
i
knew
you
had
been
brought
here
and
shall
i
stop
now
in
the
presence
of
these
men
who
have
heard
your
words
and
may
believe
them
no
that
would
be
a
cowardice
unworthy
of
our
love
and
the
true
lives
we
hope
to
lead
together
sirs
and
each
man
there
held
his
breath
to
catch
the
words
which
came
in
faint
and
fainter
intonation
from
her
lips
i
know
my
husband
to
be
innocent
because
the
hand
that
held
the
dagger
was
mine
i
killed
felix
cadwalader
the
horror
of
such
a
moment
is
never
fully
realized
till
afterward
not
a
man
there
moved
not
even
her
husband
yet
on
every
cheek
a
slow
pallor
was
forming
which
testified
to
the
effect
of
such
words
from
lips
made
for
smiles
and
showing
in
every
curve
the
habit
of
gentle
thought
and
the
loftiest
instincts
not
till
some
one
cried
out
from
the
doorway
catch
her
she
is
falling
did
any
one
stir
or
release
the
breath
which
awe
and
astonishment
had
hitherto
held
back
on
every
lip
then
he
in
whose
evident
despair
all
could
read
the
real
cause
of
the
great
dread
which
had
drawn
him
into
a
false
confession
sprang
forward
and
with
renewed
life
showing
itself
in
every
feature
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
he
staggered
with
her
to
a
sofa
and
laid
her
softly
down
he
seemed
another
man
in
look
and
bearing
and
gryce
who
had
been
watching
the
whole
wonderful
event
with
the
strongest
interest
understood
at
once
the
meaning
of
the
change
which
had
come
over
his
prisoner
at
that
point
in
his
memorable
arrest
when
he
first
realized
that
it
was
for
himself
they
had
come
and
not
for
the
really
guilty
person
the
idolized
object
of
his
affections
meanwhile
he
was
facing
them
all
with
one
hand
laid
tenderly
on
that
unconscious
head
do
not
think
he
cried
that
because
this
young
girl
has
steeped
her
hand
in
blood
she
is
a
wicked
woman
there
is
no
purer
heart
on
earth
than
hers
and
none
more
worthy
of
the
worship
of
a
true
man
see
she
killed
my
brother
son
of
my
father
beloved
by
my
mother
yet
i
can
kiss
her
hand
kiss
her
forehead
her
eyes
her
feet
not
because
i
hate
him
but
because
i
worship
her
the
purest
the
best
he
left
her
and
came
and
stood
before
those
astonished
men
sirs
he
cried
i
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
a
strange
a
terrible
tale
chapter
xiv
memoranda
it
is
like
and
unlike
what
i
have
just
related
to
you
began
young
adams
in
my
previous
confession
i
mixed
truth
and
falsehood
and
to
explain
myself
fully
and
to
help
you
to
a
right
understanding
of
my
wife
act
i
shall
have
to
start
afresh
and
speak
as
if
i
had
already
told
you
nothing
wait
cried
gryce
in
an
authoritative
manner
we
will
listen
to
you
presently
and
leaning
over
the
inspector
he
whispered
a
few
words
after
which
he
took
out
a
pencil
and
jotted
down
certain
sentences
which
he
handed
over
to
this
gentleman
as
they
had
the
appearance
of
a
memorandum
and
as
the
inspector
glanced
more
than
once
at
them
while
adams
or
cadwalader
as
he
should
now
rightfully
be
called
was
proceeding
with
his
story
i
will
present
them
to
you
as
written
points
to
be
made
clear
by
adams
in
his
account
of
this
crime
why
a
woman
who
was
calm
enough
to
stop
and
arrange
her
hair
during
the
beginning
of
an
interview
should
be
wrought
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
frenzy
and
exasperation
before
it
was
over
as
to
kill
with
her
own
hand
a
man
against
whom
she
had
evidently
no
previous
grudge
remember
the
comb
found
on
the
floor
of
adams
bedroom
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
following
words
written
just
previous
to
this
interview
by
the
man
thus
killed
i
return
you
your
daughter
neither
you
nor
she
shall
ever
see
me
again
remember
evelyn
why
was
the
pronoun
i
used
in
this
communication
what
position
did
felix
adams
hold
toward
this
young
girl
qualifying
him
to
make
use
of
such
language
after
her
marriage
to
his
brother
and
having
used
it
why
did
he
upon
being
attacked
by
her
attempt
to
swallow
the
paper
upon
which
he
had
written
these
words
actually
dying
with
it
clinched
between
his
teeth
if
he
was
killed
in
anger
and
died
as
monsters
do
her
own
word
why
did
his
face
show
sorrow
rather
than
hate
and
a
determination
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
rush
of
emotions
likely
to
follow
the
reception
of
a
mortal
blow
from
the
hand
of
an
unexpected
antagonist
why
if
he
had
strength
to
seize
the
paper
and
convey
it
to
his
lips
did
he
not
use
that
strength
in
turning
on
a
light
calculated
to
bring
him
assistance
instead
of
leaving
blazing
the
crimson
glow
which
according
to
the
code
of
signals
as
now
understood
by
us
means
nothing
more
required
just
now
keep
away
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
huge
steel
plate
found
between
the
casings
of
the
doorway
and
why
did
it
remain
at
rest
within
its
socket
at
this
the
culminating
moment
of
his
life
an
explanation
of
how
old
poindexter
came
to
appear
on
the
scene
so
soon
after
the
event
his
words
as
overheard
were
it
is
amos
son
not
amos
did
he
not
know
whom
he
was
to
meet
in
this
house
was
the
condition
of
the
man
lying
before
him
with
a
cross
on
his
bosom
and
a
dagger
in
his
heart
less
of
a
surprise
to
him
than
the
personality
of
the
victim
remember
the
conclusions
we
have
drawn
from
bartow
pantomime
adams
was
killed
by
a
thrust
watch
for
an
acknowledgment
that
the
young
woman
is
and
do
not
forget
that
an
explanation
is
due
why
for
so
long
a
time
she
held
her
other
arm
stretched
out
behind
her
why
did
the
bird
whose
chief
cry
is
remember
evelyn
sometimes
vary
it
with
poor
eva
lovely
eva
who
would
strike
eva
the
story
of
this
tragedy
to
be
true
must
show
that
adams
knew
his
bride
both
long
and
well
if
bartow
is
as
we
think
innocent
of
all
connection
with
this
crime
save
as
witness
why
does
he
show
such
joy
at
its
result
this
may
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
thomas
confession
but
it
should
not
be
ignored
by
us
this
servitor
was
driven
mad
by
a
fact
which
caused
him
joy
why
notice
the
following
schedule
it
has
been
drawn
up
after
repeated
experiments
with
bartow
and
the
various
slides
of
the
strange
lamp
which
cause
so
many
different
lights
to
shine
out
in
adams
study
white

water
wanted
green
light

and
hat
to
be
brought

the

yellow

watch
for
next

red

nothing
wanted
stay
away
the
last
was
on
at
the
final
scene
note
if
this
fact
can
be
explained
by
adams
account
of
the
same
with
these
points
in
our
mind
let
us
peruse
the
history
of
this
crime
and
of
the
remote
and
possibly
complicated
causes
which
led
to
it
book
ii
remember
evelyn
chapter
i
the
secret
of
the
cadwaladers
thomas
cadwalader
suggested
rather
than
told
his
story
we
dare
not
imitate
him
in
this
nor
would
it
be
just
to
your
interest
to
relate
these
facts
with
all
the
baldness
and
lack
of
detail
imposed
upon
this
unhappy
man
by
the
hurry
and
anxiety
of
the
occasion
remarkable
tragedies
have
their
birth
in
remarkable
facts
and
as
such
facts
are
but
the
outcome
of
human
passions
we
must
enter
into
those
passions
if
we
would
understand
either
the
facts
or
their
appalling
consequences
in
this
case
the
first
link
of
the
chain
which
led
to
felix
violent
death
was
forged
before
the
birth
of
the
woman
who
struck
him
we
must
begin
then
with
almost
forgotten
days
and
tell
the
story
as
her
pleader
did
from
the
standpoint
of
felix
and
thomas
cadwalader
thomas
cadwalader
now
called
adams
never
knew
his
mother
she
died
in
his
early
infancy
nor
could
he
be
said
to
have
known
his
father
having
been
brought
up
in
france
by
an
old
scotch
lawyer
who
being
related
to
his
mother
sometimes
spoke
of
her
but
never
of
his
father
till
thomas
had
reached
his
fifteenth
year
then
he
put
certain
books
into
his
hands
with
this
remarkable
injunction
here
are
romances
thomas
read
them
but
remember
that
none
of
them
no
matter
how
thrilling
in
matter
or
effect
will
ever
equal
the
story
of
your
father
bitterly
wronged
and
suffering
life
my
father
he
cried
tell
me
about
him
i
have
never
heard
but
his
guardian
satisfied
with
an
allusion
which
he
knew
must
bear
fruit
in
the
extremely
susceptible
nature
of
this
isolated
boy
said
no
more
that
day
and
thomas
turned
to
the
books
but
nothing
after
that
could
ever
take
his
mind
away
from
his
father
he
had
scarcely
thought
of
him
for
years
but
now
that
that
father
had
been
placed
before
him
in
the
light
of
a
wronged
man
he
found
himself
continually
hunting
back
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
memory
for
some
recollection
of
that
father
features
calculated
to
restore
his
image
to
his
eyes
sometimes
he
succeeded
in
this
or
thought
he
did
but
this
image
if
image
it
was
was
so
speedily
lost
in
a
sensation
of
something
strange
and
enveloping
it
that
he
found
himself
more
absorbed
by
the
intangible
impressions
associated
with
this
memory
than
by
the
memory
itself
what
were
these
impressions
and
in
what
had
they
originated
in
vain
he
tried
to
determine
they
were
as
vague
as
they
were
persistent
a
stretch
of
darkness
two
bars
of
orange
light
always
shining
always
the
same
black
lines
against
these
bars
like
the
tops
of
distant
gables
an
inner
thrill
a
vague
affright
a
rush
about
him
as
of
a
swooping
wind
all
this
came
with
his
father
image
only
to
fade
away
with
it
leaving
him
troubled
uneasy
and
perplexed
finding
these
impressions
persistent
and
receiving
no
explanation
of
them
in
his
own
mind
he
finally
asked
his
guardian
what
they
meant
but
that
guardian
was
as
ignorant
as
himself
on
this
topic
and
satisfied
with
having
roused
the
boy
imagination
confined
himself
to
hints
dropped
now
and
then
with
a
judiciousness
which
proved
the
existence
of
a
deliberate
purpose
of
some
duty
which
awaited
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
a
duty
which
would
explain
his
long
exile
from
his
only
parent
and
for
which
he
must
fit
himself
by
study
and
the
acquirement
of
such
accomplishments
as
render
a
young
man
a
positive
power
in
society
whether
that
society
be
of
the
old
world
or
the
new
he
showed
his
shrewdness
in
thus
dealing
with
this
pliable
and
deeply
affectionate
nature
from
this
time
forth
thomas
felt
himself
leading
a
life
of
mystery
and
interest
to
feel
himself
appointed
for
a
work
whose
unknown
character
only
heightened
its
importance
gave
point
to
every
effort
now
made
by
this
young
man
and
lent
to
his
studies
that
vague
touch
of
romance
which
made
them
a
delight
and
him
an
adept
in
many
things
he
might
otherwise
have
cared
little
about
at
eighteen
he
was
a
graduate
from
the
sorbonne
and
a
musical
virtuoso
as
well
he
could
fence
ride
and
carry
off
the
prize
in
games
requiring
physical
prowess
as
well
as
mental
fitness
he
was
in
fact
a
prodigy
in
many
ways
and
was
so
considered
by
his
he
however
was
not
perfect
he
lacked
social
charm
and
in
so
far
failed
of
being
the
complete
gentleman
this
he
was
made
to
realize
in
the
following
way
one
morning
his
guardian
came
to
him
with
a
letter
from
his
father
in
which
together
with
some
words
of
commendation
for
his
present
attainments
that
father
expressed
a
certain
dissatisfaction
with
his
general
manner
as
being
too
abrupt
and
with
those
of
his
own
sex
and
much
too
timid
and
deprecatory
with
those
of
the
other
thomas
felt
the
criticism
and
recognized
its
justice
but
how
had
his
father
proved
by
his
letter
to
be
no
longer
a
myth
become
acquainted
with
defects
which
thomas
instinctively
felt
could
never
have
attracted
the
attention
of
his
far
from
polished
guardian
his
questions
on
this
point
elicited
a
response
that
confounded
him
he
was
not
the
only
son
of
his
father
he
had
a
brother
living
and
this
brother
older
than
himself
by
some
twenty
years
or
more
had
just
been
in
paris
where
in
all
probability
he
had
met
him
talked
with
him
and
perhaps
pressed
his
hand
it
was
a
discovery
calculated
to
deepen
the
impression
already
made
upon
thomas
mind
only
a
purpose
of
the
greatest
importance
could
account
for
so
much
mystery
what
could
it
be
what
was
he
destined
to
do
or
say
or
be
he
was
not
told
but
while
awaiting
enlightenment
he
was
resolved
not
to
be
a
disappointment
to
the
two
anxious
souls
who
watched
his
career
so
eagerly
and
exacted
from
him
such
perfection
he
consequently
moderated
his
manner
and
during
the
following
year
acquired
by
constant
association
with
the
gilded
youth
about
him
that
indescribable
charm
of
the
perfect
gentleman
which
he
was
led
to
believe
would
alone
meet
with
the
approval
of
those
he
now
felt
bound
to
please
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
found
himself
a
finished
man
of
the
world
how
truly
so
he
began
to
realize
when
he
noted
the
blush
with
which
his
presence
was
hailed
by
women
and
the
respect
shown
him
by
men
of
his
own
stamp
in
the
midst
of
the
satisfaction
thus
experienced
his
guardian
paid
him
a
final
visit
you
are
now
ready
said
he
for
your
father
summons
it
will
come
in
a
few
weeks
be
careful
then
form
no
ties
you
can
not
readily
break
for
once
recalled
from
france
you
are
not
likely
to
return
here
what
your
father
purpose
concerning
you
may
be
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
no
ordinary
one
you
will
have
money
a
home
family
affection
all
that
you
have
hitherto
craved
in
vain
and
in
return
you
will
carry
solace
to
a
heart
which
has
awaited
your
healing
touch
for
twenty
years
so
much
i
am
ordered
to
say
the
rest
you
will
hear
from
your
father
own
lips
aroused
encouraged
animated
by
the
wildest
hopes
the
most
extravagant
anticipations
thomas
awaited
his
father
call
with
feverish
impatience
and
when
it
came
hastened
to
respond
to
it
by
an
immediate
voyage
to
america
this
was
some
six
months
previous
to
the
tragedy
in
street
on
his
arrival
at
the
wharf
in
new
york
he
was
met
not
by
his
brother
as
he
had
every
reason
to
expect
but
by
a
messenger
in
whose
face
evil
tidings
were
apparent
before
he
spoke
thomas
was
soon
made
acquainted
with
them
his
father
who
he
now
learned
was
called
cadwalader
he
himself
had
always
been
called
adams
was
ill
possibly
dying
he
must
therefore
hasten
and
being
provided
with
minute
instructions
as
to
his
way
took
the
train
at
once
for
a
small
village
in
northern
pennsylvania
all
that
followed
was
a
dream
to
him
he
was
hurried
through
the
night
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
still
in
his
blood
to
meet
what
he
dared
not
think
he
swam
in
a
veritable
nightmare
then
came
a
stop
a
hurrying
from
the
train
a
halt
on
a
platform
reeking
with
rain
for
the
night
was
stormy
a
call
from
some
one
to
hurry
the
sight
of
a
panting
horse
steaming
under
a
lamp
whose
blowing
flame
he
often
woke
in
after
nights
to
see
a
push
from
a
persuasive
hand
then
a
ride
over
a
country
road
the
darkness
of
which
seemed
impenetrable
and
finally
the
startling
vision
of
an
open
door
with
a
meg
merrilies
of
a
woman
standing
in
it
holding
a
flaming
candle
in
her
hand
the
candle
went
out
while
he
looked
at
it
and
left
only
a
voice
to
guide
him
a
voice
which
in
tones
shaken
by
chill
or
feeling
he
could
not
tell
which
cried
eagerly
is
that
you
laddie
come
awa
in
come
awa
in
dinna
heed
the
rain
the
maister
been
crying
on
you
a
day
i
glad
you
no
ower
late
he
got
down
followed
the
voice
and
stumbling
up
a
step
or
two
entered
a
narrow
door
which
was
with
difficulty
held
open
behind
him
and
which
swung
to
with
a
loud
noise
the
minute
he
crossed
the
threshold
this
or
the
dreariness
of
the
place
in
which
he
found
himself
disturbed
him
greatly
bare
floors
stained
walls
meagre
doorways
and
a
common
pine
staircase
lighted
only
by
the
miserable
candle
which
the
old
woman
had
relit
were
these
the
appointments
of
the
palatial
home
he
had
been
led
to
expect
these
the
surroundings
this
the
abode
of
him
who
had
exacted
such
perfection
on
his
part
and
to
satisfy
whose
standard
he
had
devoted
years
of
hourly
daily
effort
in
every
department
of
art
and
science
a
sickening
revolt
seized
him
aggravated
by
the
smiles
of
the
old
woman
who
dipped
and
courtesied
before
him
in
senile
delight
she
may
have
divined
his
feelings
for
drawing
him
inside
she
relieved
him
of
his
overcoat
crying
all
the
while
with
an
extravagant
welcome
more
repulsive
than
all
the
rest
o
the
fine
laddie
wad
your
puir
mither
could
see
you
the
noo
bonnie
and
clever
no
your
faither
bairn
ava
all
mither
laddie
all
mither
the
room
was
no
better
than
the
hall
where
is
my
father
he
asked
authoritatively
striving
to
keep
down
his
strong
repugnance
dinna
ye
hear
him
he
crying
on
ye
puir
man
he
wearying
to
see
ye
hear
him
he
could
scarcely
hear
her
the
driving
rain
the
swish
of
some
great
boughs
against
the
house
the
rattling
of
casements
and
doors
and
the
shrieking
of
wind
in
the
chimney
made
all
other
sounds
wellnigh
inaudible
yet
as
he
listened
he
seemed
to
catch
the
accents
of
a
voice
calling
now
wistfully
now
imperatively
thomas
thomas
and
thrilled
with
an
emotion
almost
superstitious
in
its
intensity
he
moved
hastily
toward
the
staircase
but
the
old
woman
was
there
before
him
na
na
she
cried
come
in
by
and
eat
something
first
but
thomas
shook
his
head
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
moment
as
if
he
never
could
eat
or
sleep
again
the
disillusion
was
so
bitter
his
disappointment
so
keen
you
will
na
then
haste
ye
haste
ye
but
it
a
peety
you
wadna
eaten
something
ye
need
it
laddie
ye
need
it
thomas
thomas
wailed
the
voice
he
tore
himself
away
he
forced
himself
to
go
upstairs
following
the
cry
which
at
every
moment
grew
louder
at
the
top
he
cast
a
final
glance
below
the
old
woman
stood
at
the
shading
the
candle
from
the
draught
with
a
hand
that
shook
with
something
more
than
age
she
was
gazing
after
him
in
vague
affright
and
with
the
shadow
of
this
fear
darkening
her
weazen
face
formed
a
picture
from
which
he
was
glad
to
escape
plunging
on
he
found
himself
before
a
window
whose
small
panes
dripped
and
groaned
under
a
rain
that
was
fast
becoming
a
torrent
chilled
by
the
sight
he
turned
toward
the
door
faintly
outlined
beside
it
and
in
the
seized
an
latch
rattling
in
the
wind
that
permeated
every
passageway
and
softly
raised
it
instantly
the
door
fell
back
and
two
eyes
blazing
with
fever
and
that
fire
of
the
soul
of
which
fever
is
the
mere
physical
symbol
greeted
him
from
the
midst
of
a
huge
bed
drawn
up
against
the
opposite
wall
then
two
arms
rose
and
the
moaning
cry
of
thomas
thomas
changed
to
a
shout
and
he
knew
himself
to
be
in
the
presence
of
his
father
falling
on
his
knees
in
speechless
emotion
he
grasped
the
wasted
hands
held
out
to
him
such
a
face
rugged
though
it
was
and
far
from
fulfilling
the
promise
held
out
to
him
in
his
dreams
could
not
but
move
any
man
as
he
gazed
into
it
and
pressed
the
hands
in
which
the
life
blood
only
seemed
to
linger
for
this
last
this
only
embrace
all
his
filial
instincts
were
aroused
and
he
forgot
the
common
surroundings
the
depressing
rain
his
own
fatigue
and
bitter
disappointment
in
his
lifelong
craving
for
love
and
family
recognition
but
the
old
man
on
whose
breast
he
fell
showed
other
emotions
than
those
by
which
he
was
himself
actuated
it
was
not
an
embrace
he
craved
but
an
opportunity
to
satisfy
an
almost
frenzied
curiosity
as
to
the
appearance
and
attributes
of
the
son
who
had
grown
to
manhood
under
other
eyes
pushing
him
gently
back
he
bade
him
stand
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
burning
on
a
small
pine
table
and
surveyed
him
as
it
were
from
the
verge
of
his
own
fast
failing
life
with
moans
of
mingled
pain
and
weariness
amid
which
thomas
thought
he
heard
the
accents
of
a
supreme
satisfaction
meanwhile
in
thomas
himself
as
he
stood
there
the
sense
of
complete
desolation
filled
his
breast
almost
to
bursting
to
have
come
home
for
this
to
find
a
father
only
to
be
weighed
in
the
scales
of
that
judgment
to
be
admired
instead
of
loved
as
he
realized
his
position
and
listened
to
the
shrieking
of
the
wind
and
rain
he
felt
that
the
wail
of
the
elements
but
echoed
the
cry
of
his
own
affections
thus
strangled
in
their
birth
indeed
the
sensations
of
that
moment
made
so
deep
an
impression
upon
him
that
he
was
never
afterward
able
to
hear
a
furious
gust
of
wind
or
rain
without
the
picture
rising
up
before
him
of
this
great
hollow
room
with
the
trembling
figure
of
his
father
struggling
in
the
grasp
of
death
and
holding
it
at
bay
while
he
gauged
with
worldly
wisdom
the
physical
mental
and
moral
advantages
of
the
son
so
long
banished
and
so
lately
restored
to
his
arms
a
rush
of
impetuous
words
followed
by
the
collapse
of
his
father
form
upon
the
pillow
showed
that
the
examination
was
over
rushing
forward
he
grasped
again
that
father
hands
but
soon
shrank
back
stunned
by
what
he
heard
and
the
prospect
it
opened
before
him
a
few
of
his
father
words
will
interpret
the
rest
they
came
in
a
flood
and
among
others
thomas
caught
these
the
grace
of
god
be
thanked
our
efforts
have
not
failed
handsome
strong
noble
in
look
and
character
we
could
ask
nothing
more
hope
for
nothing
more
my
revenge
will
succeed
john
poindexter
will
find
that
he
has
a
heart
and
that
that
heart
can
be
wrung
i
do
not
need
to
live
to
see
it
for
me
it
exists
now
it
exists
here
and
he
struck
his
breast
with
hands
that
seemed
to
have
reserved
their
last
strength
for
this
supreme
gesture
john
poindexter
who
was
he
it
was
a
new
name
to
thomas
venturing
to
say
so
he
reeled
under
the
look
he
received
from
his
father
eyes
you
do
not
know
who
john
poindexter
is
and
what
he
has
done
to
me
and
mine
they
have
kept
their
promise
well
too
well
but
god
will
accord
me
strength
to
tell
you
what
has
been
left
unsaid
by
them
he
would
not
bring
me
up
to
this
hour
to
let
me
perish
before
you
have
heard
the
story
destined
to
make
you
the
avenger
of
innocence
upon
that
enemy
of
your
race
listen
thomas
with
the
hand
of
death
encircling
my
heart
i
speak
and
if
the
story
find
you
cold
but
it
will
not
your
name
is
cadwalader
and
it
will
not
constrained
by
passions
such
as
he
had
never
imagined
even
in
dreams

fell
upon
his
knees
he
could
not
listen
otherwise
his
father
gasping
for
breath
fixed
him
with
his
hollow
eyes
in
which
the
last
flickering
flames
of
life
flared
up
in
fitful
brightness
thomas
the
pause
was
brief
you
are
not
my
only
child
i
know
it
fell
from
thomas
white
lips
i
have
a
brother
his
name
is
felix
the
father
shook
his
head
with
a
look
suggestive
of
impatience
not
him
not
him
he
cried
a
sister
a
sister
who
died
before
you
were
born
beautiful
good
with
a
voice
like
an
angel
and
a
heart
she
should
be
standing
by
my
side
and
she
would
have
been
if
if
he
but
none
of
that
i
have
no
breath
to
waste
facts
facts
just
facts
afterward
may
come
emotions
hatred
denunciation
not
now
this
is
my
story
thomas
john
poindexter
and
i
were
friends
from
boyhood
we
shared
each
bed
food
and
pleasures
and
when
he
came
to
seek
his
fortune
in
america
i
accompanied
him
he
was
an
able
man
but
cold
i
was
of
an
affectionate
nature
but
without
any
business
capacity
as
proof
of
this
in
fifteen
years
he
was
rich
esteemed
the
master
of
a
fine
house
and
the
owner
of
half
a
dozen
horses
while
i
was
the
same
nobody
i
had
been
at
first
or
would
have
been
had
not
providence
given
me
two
beautiful
children
and
blessed
or
rather
cursed
me
with
the
friendship
of
this
prosperous
man
when
felix
was
fourteen
and
evelyn
three
years
older
their
mother
died
soon
after
the
little
money
i
had
vanished
in
an
unfortunate
enterprise
and
life
began
to
promise
ill
both
for
myself
and
for
my
growing
children
john
poindexter
who
was
honest
enough
then
or
let
me
hope
so
and
who
had
no
children
of
his
own
though
he
had
been
long
married
offered
to
take
one
of
mine
to
educate
but
i
did
not
consent
to
this
till
the
war
of
the
rebellion
broke
out
then
i
sent
him
both
son
and
daughter
and
went
into
the
army
for
four
years
i
fought
for
the
flag
suffering
all
that
a
man
can
suffer
and
live
and
being
at
last
released
from
libby
prison
came
home
with
a
heart
full
of
gratitude
and
with
every
affection
keyed
up
by
a
long
series
of
unspeakable
experiences
to
greet
my
son
and
clasp
once
more
within
my
wasted
arms
the
idolized
form
of
my
deeply
loved
daughter
what
did
i
find
a
funeral
in
the
streets
hers
and
felix
your
brother
walking
like
a
guard
between
her
speechless
corpse
and
the
man
under
whose
protection
i
had
placed
her
youth
and
innocence
betrayed
shrieked
the
now
frenzied
parent
rising
on
his
pillow
her
innocence
her
sweetness
and
he
cold
as
the
stone
we
laid
upon
her
grave
had
seen
her
perish
with
the
anguish
and
shame
of
it
without
a
sign
of
grief
or
a
word
of
contrition
o
god
burst
from
lips
the
old
man
was
watching
with
frenzied
cunning
ay
god
repeated
the
father
shaking
his
head
as
if
in
defiance
before
he
fell
back
on
his
pillow
he
allowed
it
and
i
but
this
does
not
tell
the
story
i
must
keep
to
facts
as
felix
did
felix
who
was
but
fifteen
years
old
and
yet
found
himself
the
only
confidant
and
solace
of
this
young
girl
betrayed
by
her
protector
it
was
after
her
burial
cease
cried
a
voice
smooth
fresh
and
yet
strangely
commanding
from
over
thomas
shoulder
let
me
tell
the
rest
no
man
can
tell
the
rest
as
i
can
felix
ejaculated
amos
cadwalader
below
his
breath
felix
repeated
thomas
shaken
to
his
very
heart
by
this
new
presence
but
when
he
sought
to
rise
to
turn
he
felt
the
pressure
of
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
heard
that
voice
again
saying
softly
but
peremptorily
wait
wait
till
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
think
not
of
me
think
only
of
her
it
is
she
you
are
called
upon
to
avenge
your
sister
evelyn
thomas
yielded
to
him
as
he
had
to
his
father
he
sank
down
beneath
that
insistent
hand
and
his
brother
took
up
the
tale
evelyn
had
a
voice
like
a
bird
in
those
days
before
father
return
she
used
to
fill
old
john
poindexter
house
with
melody
i
who
as
a
boy
was
studious
rather
than
artistic
thought
she
sang
too
much
for
a
girl
whose
father
was
rotting
away
in
a
southern
prison
but
when
about
to
rebuke
her
i
remembered
edward
kissam
and
was
silent
for
it
was
his
love
which
made
her
glad
and
to
him
i
wished
every
happiness
for
he
was
good
and
honest
and
kind
to
me
she
was
eighteen
then
and
beautiful
or
so
i
was
bound
to
believe
since
every
man
looked
at
her
even
old
john
poindexter
though
he
never
looked
at
any
other
woman
not
even
his
own
wife
and
she
was
good
too
and
pure
i
swear
for
her
blue
eyes
never
faltered
in
looking
into
mine
until
one
day
when
my
god
how
well
i
remember
it
they
not
only
faltered
but
shrank
before
me
in
such
terror
that
boy
though
i
was
i
knew
that
something
terrible
something
unprecedented
had
happened
and
thinking
my
one
thought
i
asked
if
she
had
received
bad
news
from
father
her
answer
was
a
horrified
moan
but
it
might
have
been
a
shriek
father
pray
god
we
may
never
see
him
or
hear
from
him
again
if
you
love
him
if
you
love
me
pray
he
may
die
in
prison
rather
than
return
here
to
see
me
as
i
am
now
i
thought
she
had
gone
mad
and
perhaps
she
had
for
a
moment
for
at
my
look
of
startled
distress
a
change
took
place
in
her
she
remembered
my
youth
and
laughing
or
trying
to
laugh
away
her
frenzy
uttered
some
hurried
words
i
failed
to
understand
and
then
sinking
at
my
knee
laid
her
head
against
my
side
crying
that
she
was
not
well
that
she
had
experienced
for
a
long
time
secret
pains
and
great
inward
distress
and
that
she
sometimes
feared
she
was
not
going
to
live
long
for
all
her
songs
and
merry
ways
and
seeming
health
and
spirits
live
evelyn
it
was
an
inconceivable
thought
to
me
a
boy
i
looked
at
her
and
seeing
how
pale
how
incomprehensibly
pale
she
was
my
heart
failed
me
for
nothing
but
mortal
sickness
could
make
such
a
change
in
any
one
in
a
week
in
a
day
yet
how
could
death
reach
her
loved
as
she
was
by
edward
by
her
father
and
by
me
thinking
to
rouse
her
i
spoke
the
former
name
but
it
was
the
last
word
i
should
have
uttered
crouching
as
if
i
had
given
her
a
blow
she
put
her
two
hands
out
shrieking
faintly
that
never
that
do
not
speak
his
name
let
me
never
hear
of
him
or
see
him
again
i
am
dead
do
you
not
understand
me
dead
to
all
the
world
from
this
day
except
to
you
she
suddenly
sobbed
to
you
and
still
i
did
not
comprehend
her
but
when
i
understood
as
i
soon
did
that
no
mention
was
to
be
made
of
her
illness
that
her
door
was
to
be
shut
and
no
one
allowed
to
enter
not
even
poindexter
or
her
guardian
least
of
all
her
guardian
i
began
to
catch
the
first
intimation
of
that
horror
which
was
to
end
my
youth
and
fill
my
whole
after
life
with
but
one
thought
revenge
but
i
said
nothing
only
watched
and
waited
seeing
that
she
was
really
ill
i
constituted
myself
her
nurse
and
sat
by
her
night
and
day
till
her
symptoms
became
so
alarming
that
the
whole
household
was
aroused
and
we
could
no
longer
keep
the
doctor
from
her
then
i
sat
at
her
door
and
with
one
ear
turned
to
catch
her
lightest
moan
listened
for
the
step
she
most
dreaded
but
which
though
it
sometimes
approached
never
passed
the
opening
of
the
hall
leading
to
her
chamber
for
one
whole
week
i
sat
there
watching
her
life
go
slowly
out
like
a
flame
with
nothing
to
feed
it
then
as
the
great
shadow
fell
and
life
seemed
breaking
up
within
me
i
dashed
from
the
place
and
confronting
him
where
i
found
him
walking
pale
and
disturbed
in
his
own
hall
told
him
that
my
father
was
coming
that
i
had
had
a
dream
and
in
that
dream
i
had
seen
my
father
with
his
face
turned
toward
this
place
was
he
prepared
to
meet
him
had
he
an
answer
ready
when
amos
cadwalader
should
ask
him
what
had
become
of
his
child
i
had
meant
to
shock
the
truth
from
this
man
and
i
did
so
as
i
mentioned
my
father
name
poindexter
blanched
and
my
fears
became
certainty
dropping
my
youthful
manner
for
i
was
a
boy
no
longer
i
flung
his
crime
in
his
face
and
begged
him
to
deny
it
if
he
could
he
could
not
but
he
did
what
neither
he
nor
any
other
man
could
do
in
my
presence
now
and
live
he
smiled
then
when
he
saw
me
crouching
for
a
spring
for
young
as
i
was
i
knew
but
one
impulse
and
that
was
to
fly
at
his
throat
he
put
out
his
powerful
hand
and
pinning
me
to
the
ground
uttered
a
few
short
sentences
in
my
ear
they
were
terrible
ones
they
made
me
see
that
nothing
i
might
then
do
could
obliterate
the
fact
that
she
was
lost
if
the
world
knew
what
i
knew
or
even
so
much
as
suspected
it
that
any
betrayal
on
my
part
or
act
of
contrition
on
his
would
only
pile
the
earth
on
her
innocent
breast
and
sink
her
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
grave
she
was
then
digging
for
herself
that
all
dreams
were
falsities
that
southern
prisons
seldom
gave
up
their
victims
alive
and
that
if
my
father
should
escape
the
jaws
of
libby
and
return
it
was
for
me
to
be
glad
if
he
found
a
quiet
grave
instead
of
a
dishonored
daughter
further
that
if
i
crossed
him
who
was
power
itself
by
any
boyish
exhibition
of
hate
i
would
find
that
any
odium
i
might
invoke
would
fall
on
her
and
not
on
him
making
me
an
abhorrence
not
only
to
the
world
at
large
but
to
the
very
father
in
whose
interest
i
might
pretend
to
act
i
was
young
and
without
worldly
experience
i
yielded
to
these
arguments
but
i
cursed
him
where
he
stood
with
his
hand
pressing
heavily
upon
me
i
cursed
him
to
his
face
then
i
went
back
to
my
sister
had
she
by
some
supernatural
power
listened
to
our
talk
or
had
she
really
been
visited
by
some
dream
that
she
looked
so
changed
there
was
a
feverish
light
in
her
eye
and
something
like
the
shadow
of
a
smile
on
her
lips
poindexter
was
with
her
poindexter
whose
face
was
a
mask
we
never
tried
to
penetrate
but
when
she
had
left
us
alone
again
then
evelyn
spoke
and
i
saw
what
her
dream
had
been
she
cried
as
i
approached
her
trembling
with
my
own
emotions
and
half
afraid
of
hers
is
still
one
hope
for
me
it
has
come
to
me
while
you
have
been
away
edward
he
loves
me
did
perhaps
he
would
forgive
if
he
would
take
me
into
his
protection
i
see
you
know
it
all
felix
then
i
might
grow
happy
again
well
strong
good
do
you
think
oh
you
are
a
child
what
do
you
know
but
but
before
i
turn
my
face
forever
to
the
wall
try
if
he
will
see
me
try
try
with
your
boy
wit
your
clever
schemes
to
get
him
here
unknown
to
to
the
one
i
fear
i
hate
and
then
then
if
he
bids
me
live
i
will
live
and
if
he
bids
me
die
i
will
die
and
all
will
be
ended
i
was
an
ignorant
boy
i
knew
men
no
more
than
i
knew
women
and
yielding
to
her
importunities
i
promised
to
see
edward
and
plan
for
an
interview
without
her
guardian
knowledge
i
was
as
evelyn
had
said
keen
in
those
days
and
full
of
resources
and
i
easily
managed
it
edward
who
had
watched
from
the
garden
as
i
had
from
the
door
was
easily
persuaded
to
climb
her
lattice
in
search
of
what
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
his
last
earthly
interview
with
his
darling
as
his
eager
form
bounded
into
the
room
i
tottered
forth
carrying
with
me
a
vision
of
her
face
as
she
rose
to
meet
what
i
dared
not
think
or
attempt
to
foresee
falling
on
my
knees
i
waited
the
issue
alas
it
was
a
speedy
one
a
stifled
moan
from
her
the
sound
of
a
hoarse
farewell
from
him
told
me
that
his
love
had
failed
her
and
that
her
doom
was
sealed
creeping
back
to
her
side
as
quickly
as
my
failing
courage
admitted
i
found
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
from
which
it
never
again
looked
back
while
presently
before
the
hour
was
passed
shouts
ringing
through
the
town
proclaimed
that
young
kissam
had
shot
himself
she
heard
and
died
that
night
in
her
last
hour
she
had
fancies
she
thought
she
saw
her
father
and
her
prayers
for
mercy
were
then
she
thought
she
saw
him
that
demon
her
executioner
and
cringed
and
moaned
against
the
wall
but
enough
of
this
two
days
after
i
walked
between
him
and
her
silent
figure
outstretched
for
burial
i
had
promised
that
no
eye
but
mine
should
look
upon
her
no
other
hand
touch
her
and
i
kept
my
word
even
when
the
impossible
happened
and
her
father
rose
up
in
the
street
before
us
quietly
and
in
honor
she
was
carried
to
her
grave
and
then
then
in
the
solitude
of
the
retreat
i
had
found
for
him
i
told
our
father
all
and
why
i
had
denied
him
the
only
comfort
which
seemed
left
to
him
a
last
look
at
his
darling
daughter
face
chapter
ii
the
oath
a
sigh
from
the
panting
breast
of
amos
cadwalader
followed
these
words
plainer
than
speech
it
told
of
a
grief
still
fresh
and
an
agony
still
unappeased
though
thirty
years
had
passed
away
since
the
unhappy
hour
of
which
felix
spoke
felix
echoing
it
went
quickly
on
it
was
dusk
when
i
told
my
story
and
from
dark
to
dawn
we
sat
with
eyes
fixed
on
each
other
face
without
sleep
and
without
rest
then
we
sought
john
poindexter
had
he
shunned
us
we
might
have
had
mercy
but
he
met
us
openly
quietly
and
with
all
the
indifference
of
one
who
can
not
measure
feeling
because
he
is
incapable
of
experiencing
it
himself
his
first
sentence
evinced
this
yourselves
spare
me
all
useless
recriminations
the
girl
is
dead
i
can
not
call
her
back
again
enjoy
your
life
your
eating
and
your
drinking
your
getting
and
your
spending
it
is
but
for
a
few
more
years
at
best
why
harp
on
old
his
last
word
was
a
triumph
a
man
cares
for
nothing
or
nobody
it
is
useless
to
curse
him
ah
that
was
it
that
was
the
secret
of
his
power
he
cared
for
nothing
and
for
no
one
not
even
for
himself
we
felt
the
blow
and
bent
under
it
but
before
leaving
him
and
the
town
we
swore
your
father
and
i
that
we
would
yet
make
that
cold
heart
feel
that
some
day
in
some
way
we
would
cause
that
impassive
nature
to
suffer
as
he
had
made
us
suffer
however
happy
he
might
seem
or
however
closely
his
prosperity
might
cling
to
him
that
was
thirty
years
ago
and
that
oath
has
not
yet
been
fulfilled
felix
paused
thomas
lifted
his
head
but
the
old
man
would
not
let
him
speak
there
are
men
who
forget
in
a
month
others
who
forget
in
a
year
i
have
never
forgotten
nor
has
felix
here
when
you
were
born
i
had
married
again
in
the
hope
of
renewed
joy
i
felt
i
know
not
why
that
evelyn
avenger
was
come
and
when
a
year
or
so
after
this
event
we
heard
that
god
had
forgotten
john
poindexter
sins
or
perhaps
remembered
them
and
that
a
child
was
given
him
also
after
eighteen
years
of
married
life
i
looked
upon
your
bonny
face
and
saw
or
thought
i
saw
a
possible
means
of
bringing
about
the
vengeance
to
which
felix
and
i
had
dedicated
our
lives
you
grew
your
ardent
nature
generous
temper
and
facile
mind
promised
an
abundant
manhood
and
when
your
mother
died
leaving
me
for
a
second
time
a
widower
i
no
longer
hesitated
to
devote
you
to
the
purpose
for
which
you
seemed
born
thomas
do
you
remember
the
beginning
of
that
journey
which
finally
led
you
far
from
me
how
i
bore
you
on
my
shoulder
along
a
dusty
road
till
arrived
within
sight
of
his
home
i
raised
you
from
among
the
tombs
and
showing
you
those
distant
gables
looming
black
against
the
twilight
gold
dedicated
you
to
the
destruction
of
whatever
happiness
might
hereafter
develop
under
his
infant
smile
you
do
i
did
not
think
you
could
forget
and
now
that
the
time
has
come
for
the
promise
of
that
hour
to
be
fulfilled
i
call
on
you
again
thomas
avenge
our
griefs
avenge
your
sister
girl
has
grown
to
at
the
suggestion
conveyed
in
these
words
thomas
recoiled
in
horror
but
the
old
man
failed
to
read
his
emotion
rightly
clutching
his
arm
he
proceeded
passionately
woo
her
win
her
they
do
not
know
you
you
will
be
thomas
adams
to
them
not
thomas
cadwalader
gather
this
budding
flower
into
your
bosom
and
then
oh
he
must
love
his
child
through
her
we
have
our
hand
on
his
heart
make
her
suffer
she
but
a
country
girl
and
you
have
lived
in
paris
make
her
suffer
and
if
in
doing
so
you
cause
him
to
blench
then
believe
i
am
looking
upon
you
from
the
grave
i
go
to
and
be
happy
for
you
will
not
have
lived
nor
will
i
have
died
in
vain
he
paused
to
catch
his
failing
breath
but
his
indomitable
will
triumphed
over
death
and
held
thomas
under
a
spell
that
confounded
his
instincts
and
made
him
the
puppet
of
feelings
which
had
accumulated
their
force
to
fill
him
in
one
hour
with
a
hate
which
it
had
taken
his
father
and
brother
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
bring
to
the
point
of
active
vengeance
i
shall
die
i
am
dying
now
the
old
man
panted
on
i
shall
never
live
to
see
your
triumph
i
shall
never
behold
john
poindexter
eye
glaze
with
those
sufferings
which
rend
the
entrails
and
make
a
man
question
if
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
but
i
shall
know
it
where
i
am
no
mounded
earth
can
keep
my
spirit
down
when
john
poindexter
feels
his
doom
i
shall
be
conscious
of
his
anguish
and
shall
rejoice
and
when
in
the
depths
of
darkness
to
which
i
go
he
comes
faltering
along
my
way
boy
boy
you
have
been
reared
for
this
god
made
you
handsome
man
has
made
you
strong
you
have
made
yourself
intelligent
and
accomplished
you
have
only
to
show
yourself
to
this
country
girl
to
become
the
master
of
her
will
and
affection
and
these
once
yours
remember
evelyn
never
had
thomas
been
witness
to
such
passion
it
swept
him
along
in
a
burning
stream
against
which
he
sought
to
contend
and
could
not
raising
his
hand
in
what
he
meant
as
a
response
to
that
appeal
he
endeavored
to
speak
but
failed
his
father
misinterpreted
his
silence
and
bitterly
cried
you
are
dumb
you
do
not
like
the
task
are
virtuous
perhaps
you
who
have
lived
for
years
alone
and
unhampered
in
paris
or
you
have
instincts
of
honor
habits
of
generosity
that
blind
you
to
wrongs
that
for
a
longer
space
than
your
lifetime
have
cried
aloud
to
heaven
for
vengeance
thomas
thomas
if
you
should
fail
me
now
he
will
not
fail
you
broke
in
the
voice
of
felix
calm
suave
and
insinuating
i
have
watched
him
i
know
him
he
will
not
fail
you
thomas
shuddered
he
had
forgotten
felix
but
as
he
heard
these
words
he
could
no
longer
delay
looking
at
the
man
who
had
offered
to
stand
his
surety
for
the
performance
of
the
unholy
deed
his
father
exacted
from
him
turning
he
saw
a
man
who
in
any
place
and
under
any
roof
would
attract
attention
awake
admiration
and
yes
fear
he
was
not
a
large
man
not
so
large
as
himself
but
the
will
that
expressed
itself
in
frenzy
on
his
father
lips
showed
quiet
and
inflexible
in
the
gray
eye
resting
upon
his
own
with
a
power
he
could
never
hope
to
evade
as
he
looked
and
comprehended
a
steel
band
seemed
to
compress
his
heart
yet
he
was
conscious
at
the
same
time
that
the
personality
before
which
he
thus
succumbed
was
as
elegant
as
his
own
and
as
perfectly
trained
in
all
the
ways
of
men
and
of
life
even
the
air
of
poverty
which
had
shocked
him
in
his
father
person
and
surroundings
was
not
visible
here
felix
was
both
well
and
handsomely
clad
and
could
hold
his
own
as
the
elder
brother
in
every
respect
most
insisted
upon
by
the
parisian
gentleman
the
long
and
to
thomas
mysterious
curtain
of
serge
which
stretched
behind
him
from
floor
to
ceiling
threw
out
his
pale
features
with
a
remarkable
distinctness
and
for
an
instant
thomas
wondered
if
it
had
been
hung
there
for
the
purpose
of
producing
this
effect
but
the
demand
in
his
brother
face
drew
his
attention
and
bowing
his
head
he
stammered
i
am
at
your
command
felix
i
am
at
your
command
father
i
can
not
say
more
only
remember
that
i
never
saw
evelyn
that
she
died
before
i
was
born
and
that
i
but
here
felix
voice
broke
in
kind
but
measured
perhaps
there
is
some
obstacle
we
have
not
reckoned
upon
you
may
already
love
some
woman
and
desire
to
marry
her
if
so
it
need
be
no
impediment
but
here
thomas
indignation
found
voice
no
said
he
i
am
save
for
a
few
lingering
fancies
which
are
fast
becoming
vanishing
dreams
he
seemed
to
have
lived
years
since
entering
this
room
your
heart
will
not
be
disturbed
now
commented
felix
i
have
seen
the
girl
i
went
there
on
purpose
a
year
ago
she
as
pale
as
a
and
as
listless
you
will
not
be
obliged
to
recall
to
mind
the
gay
smiles
of
parisian
ladies
to
be
proof
against
her
charms
thomas
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
must
be
made
to
know
the
full
intoxication
of
hope
felix
proceeded
in
his
clear
and
cutting
voice
to
realize
despair
she
must
first
experience
every
delight
that
comes
with
satisfied
love
have
you
the
skill
as
well
as
heart
to
play
to
the
end
a
rôle
which
will
take
patience
as
well
as
dissimulation
courage
as
well
as
subtlety
and
that
union
of
will
and
implacability
which
finds
its
food
in
tears
and
is
strengthened
rather
than
lessened
by
the
suffering
of
its
victim
i
have
the
skill
murmured
thomas
but
you
lack
the
incentive
finished
felix
well
well
we
must
have
patience
with
your
doubts
and
hesitations
our
hate
has
been
fostered
by
memories
of
her
whom
as
you
say
you
have
never
seen
look
then
thomas
look
at
your
sister
as
she
was
as
she
is
for
us
look
at
her
and
think
of
her
as
despoiled
killed
forgotten
by
poindexter
have
you
ever
gazed
upon
a
more
moving
countenance
or
one
in
which
beauty
contends
with
a
keener
prophecy
of
woe
not
knowing
what
to
expect
anticipating
almost
to
be
met
by
her
shade
thomas
followed
the
direction
of
his
brother
lifted
hand
and
beheld
where
but
a
minute
before
that
dismal
curtain
had
hung
a
blaze
of
light
in
the
midst
of
which
he
saw
a
charming
but
tragic
figure
such
as
no
gallery
in
all
europe
had
ever
shown
him
possibly
because
no
other
limned
face
or
form
had
ever
appealed
to
his
heart
it
did
not
seem
a
picture
it
seemed
her
very
self
a
gentle
loving
self
that
breathed
forth
all
the
tenderness
he
had
vainly
sought
for
in
his
living
relatives
and
falling
at
her
feet
he
cried
out
do
not
look
at
me
so
reproachfully
sweet
evelyn
i
was
born
to
avenge
you
and
i
will
john
poindexter
shall
never
go
down
in
peace
to
his
tomb
a
sigh
of
utter
contentment
came
from
the
direction
of
the
bed
swear
it
cried
his
father
holding
out
his
arms
before
him
in
the
form
of
a
cross
yes
swear
it
repeated
felix
laying
his
own
hand
on
those
crossed
arms
thomas
drew
near
and
laid
his
hand
beside
that
of
felix
i
swear
he
began
raising
his
voice
above
the
tempest
which
poured
gust
after
gust
against
the
house
i
swear
to
win
the
affections
of
eva
poindexter
and
then
when
her
heart
is
all
mine
to
cast
her
back
in
anguish
and
contumely
on
the
breast
of
john
poindexter
good
came
from
what
seemed
to
him
an
immeasurable
distance
then
the
darkness
which
since
the
taking
of
this
oath
had
settled
over
his
senses
fell
and
he
sank
insensible
at
the
feet
of
his
dying
father
amos
cadwalader
died
that
night
but
not
without
one
awful
scene
more
about
midnight
he
roused
from
the
sleep
which
had
followed
the
exciting
incidents
i
have
just
related
and
glancing
from
thomas
to
felix
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
bed
fixed
his
eyes
with
a
strange
gleam
upon
the
door
ah
he
ejaculated
a
visitor
john
poindexter
he
comes
to
ask
my
forgiveness
before
i
set
out
on
my
dismal
journey
the
sarcasm
of
his
tone
the
courtesy
of
his
manner
caused
the
hair
to
stir
on
the
heads
of
his
two
sons
that
he
saw
his
enemy
as
plainly
as
he
saw
them
neither
could
doubt
does
he
dread
my
meeting
with
evelyn
does
he
wish
to
placate
me
before
i
am
joined
to
that
pathetic
shade
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
i
forgive
you
john
poindexter
i
forgive
you
my
daughter
shame
my
blighted
life
i
am
dying
but
i
leave
one
behind
who
will
not
forgive
you
i
have
a
son
an
avenger
of
the
dead
who
yet
lives
to
to
he
fell
back
with
these
words
which
seemed
to
seal
thomas
to
his
task
amos
cadwalader
died
chapter
iii
eva
felix
had
not
inherited
his
father
incapacity
for
making
money
in
the
twenty
years
that
had
passed
since
thomas
had
been
abroad
he
had
built
up
a
fortune
which
he
could
not
induce
his
father
to
share
but
which
that
father
was
perfectly
willing
to
see
devoted
to
their
mutual
revenge
there
was
meaning
therefore
in
the
injunction
felix
gave
his
brother
on
his
departure
for
montgomery
i
have
money
spend
it
spend
what
you
will
and
when
your
task
is
completed
there
will
still
be
some
left
for
your
amusement
thomas
bowed
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
was
his
thought
and
you
he
asked
looking
about
the
scanty
walls
which
seemed
to
have
lost
their
very
excuse
for
being
now
that
his
father
had
died
will
you
remain
here
felix
answer
was
abrupt
but
positive
no
i
go
to
new
york
i
have
rented
a
house
there
which
you
may
one
day
wish
to
share
the
name
under
which
i
have
leased
it
is
adams
felix
adams
as
such
you
will
address
me
cadwalader
is
a
name
that
must
not
leave
your
lips
in
montgomery
nor
must
you
forget
that
my
person
is
known
there
otherwise
we
might
not
have
been
dependent
on
you
for
the
success
of
our
revenge
and
he
smiled
fully
conscious
of
being
the
handsomer
man
of
the
two
and
now
how
about
those
introductions
we
enjoined
you
to
bring
from
paris
the
history
of
the
next
few
weeks
can
best
be
understood
by
reading
certain
letters
sent
by
thomas
to
felix
by
examining
a
diary
drawn
up
by
the
same
writer
for
his
own
relief
and
satisfaction
the
letters
will
be
found
on
the
left
and
the
diary
on
the
right
of
the
double
columns
hereby
submitted
the
former
are
a
summary
of
facts
the
latter
is
a
summary
of
feelings
both
are
necessary
to
a
right
comprehension
of
the
situation
first
letter
dear
felix
i
am
here
i
have
seen
her
she
is
as
you
have
said
a
pale
blonde
i
present
my
credentials
to
john
poindexter
from
what
i
have
already
experienced
i
anticipate
a
favorable
reception
yours
thomas
first
entry
i
could
not
write
felix
the
true
story
of
this
day
why
and
why
must
i
write
it
here
to
turn
my
mind
from
dwelling
on
it
perhaps
i
do
not
seem
to
understand
my
own
feelings
or
why
i
begin
to
dread
my
task
while
ardently
pressing
forward
to
accomplish
it
i
have
seen
her
this
much
i
wrote
to
felix
but
i
did
not
say
where
our
meeting
took
place
or
how
how
could
i
would
he
understand
how
one
of
poindexter
blood
could
be
employed
in
a
gracious
act
or
how
i
filled
with
a
purpose
that
has
made
my
heart
dark
as
hell
ever
since
i
embraced
it
could
find
that
heart
swell
and
that
purpose
sink
at
my
first
glimpse
of
the
face
whose
beauty
i
have
sworn
to
devote
to
agony
and
tears
surely
surely
felix
would
have
been
stronger
and
yet
i
went
from
the
cars
to
the
cemetery
before
entering
the
town
or
seeing
to
my
own
comfort
i
sought
evelyn
grave
there
to
renew
my
oath
in
the
place
where
nineteen
years
ago
my
father
held
me
up
a
child
in
threat
toward
john
poindexter
home
i
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
old
and
neglected
stone
which
marked
her
and
was
bending
in
the
sunset
light
to
examine
it
when
the
rustle
of
a
woman
skirts
attracted
my
attention
and
i
perceived
advancing
toward
me
a
young
girl
in
a
nimbus
of
rosy
light
which
seemed
to
lift
her
from
the
ground
and
give
to
her
delicate
figure
and
strangely
illumined
head
an
ethereal
aspect
which
her
pure
features
and
tender
bearing
did
not
belie
in
her
arms
she
carried
a
huge
cluster
of
lilies
and
when
i
observed
that
her
eyes
were
directed
not
on
me
but
on
the
grave
beside
which
i
stood
i
moved
aside
into
the
shadow
of
some
bushes
and
watched
her
while
she
strewed
these
flowers
emblems
of
innocence
over
the
grave
i
had
just
left
what
did
it
mean
and
who
was
this
young
girl
who
honored
with
such
gracious
memorials
the
grave
of
my
sister
as
she
rose
from
her
task
i
could
no
longer
restrain
either
my
emotion
or
the
curiosity
with
which
her
act
had
inspired
me
advancing
i
greeted
her
with
all
the
respect
her
appearance
called
for
and
noting
that
her
face
was
even
more
beautiful
when
lifted
in
speech
than
when
bent
in
gravity
over
her
flowers
i
asked
her
in
the
indifferent
tone
of
a
stranger
who
was
buried
in
this
spot
and
why
she
a
mere
girl
dropped
flowers
upon
a
grave
the
mosses
of
whose
stone
proved
it
to
have
been
dug
long
before
she
was
born
her
answer
caused
me
a
shock
full
as
my
life
has
lately
been
of
startling
experiences
i
strew
flowers
here
said
she
because
the
girl
who
lies
buried
under
this
stone
had
the
same
birthday
as
myself
i
never
saw
her
it
true
but
she
died
in
my
father
house
when
she
was
no
older
than
i
am
and
since
i
have
become
a
woman
and
realize
what
loss
there
is
in
dying
young
i
have
made
it
a
custom
to
share
with
her
my
birthday
flowers
she
was
a
lily
they
say
in
appearance
and
character
and
so
i
bring
her
lilies
it
was
eva
poindexter
the
girl
i
and
she
was
strewing
flowers
on
evelyn
grave
letter
ii
dear
felix
i
have
touched
the
hand
of
john
poindexter
in
order
to
win
a
place
in
the
good
graces
of
the
daughter
i
must
please
the
father
or
at
least
attract
his
favorable
notice
i
have
reason
to
think
i
have
done
this
very
truly
thomas
entry
ii
i
no
longer
feel
myself
a
true
man
john
poindexter
is
cold
in
appearance
hard
in
manner
and
inflexible
in
opinion
but
he
does
not
inspire
the
abhorrence
i
anticipated
nor
awaken
in
me
the
one
thought
due
to
the
memory
of
my
sister
is
it
because
he
is
eva
father
has
the
loveliness
of
the
daughter
cast
a
halo
about
the
parent
if
so
felix
has
a
right
to
execrate
me
and
my
father
to
letter
iii
dear
felix
the
introductions
furnished
me
have
made
me
received
everywhere
there
is
considerable
wealth
here
and
many
fine
houses
consequently
i
find
myself
in
a
congenial
society
of
which
she
is
the
star
did
i
say
that
he
was
as
of
old
the
chief
man
of
the
town
yours
truly
thomas
entry
iii
she
is
beautiful
she
has
the
daintiness
of
the
lily
and
the
flush
of
the
rose
but
it
is
not
her
beauty
that
moves
me
it
is
the
strange
sweetness
of
her
nature
which
nevertheless
has
no
weakness
in
it
on
the
contrary
it
possesses
peculiar
strength
which
becomes
instantly
apparent
at
the
call
of
duty
could
felix
have
imagined
such
a
poindexter
i
can
not
contemplate
such
loveliness
and
associate
it
with
the
execrable
sin
which
calls
down
vengeance
upon
this
house
i
can
not
even
dwell
upon
my
past
life
all
that
is
dark
threatening
secret
and
revengeful
slips
from
me
under
her
eye
and
i
dream
of
what
is
pure
true
satisfying
and
ennobling
and
this
by
the
influence
of
her
smile
rather
than
of
her
words
have
i
been
given
an
angel
to
degrade
or
am
i
so
blind
as
to
behold
a
saint
where
others
felix
let
us
say
would
see
only
a
pretty
woman
with
unexpected
attractions
letter
iv
dear
felix
rides
dances
games
nonsense
generally
my
interest
in
this
young
girl
is
beginning
to
be
publicly
recognized
she
alone
seems
ignorant
of
it
sometimes
i
wonder
if
our
scheme
will
fail
through
her
impassibility
and
more
than
conventional
innocence
i
am
sometimes
afraid
she
will
never
love
me
yet
i
have
exerted
myself
to
please
her
indeed
i
could
not
have
exerted
myself
more
i
went
miles
on
horseback
to
procure
her
a
trifle
she
fancied
yours
thomas
entry
iv
all
will
not
go
as
easily
as
felix
imagines
eva
poindexter
may
be
a
country
girl
but
she
has
her
standards
too
and
mere
grace
and
attainment
are
not
sufficient
to
win
her
have
i
the
other
qualities
she
demands
that
remains
to
be
seen
i
have
one
she
never
dreams
of
will
its
shadow
so
overwhelm
the
rest
that
her
naturally
pure
spirit
will
shrink
from
me
just
at
the
moment
when
i
think
her
mine
i
can
not
tell
and
the
doubt
creates
a
hell
within
me
something
deeper
stronger
more
imperious
than
my
revenge
makes
the
winning
of
this
girl
heart
a
necessity
to
me
i
have
forgotten
my
purpose
in
this
desire
i
have
forgotten
everything
except
that
she
is
the
one
woman
of
my
life
and
that
i
can
never
rest
till
her
heart
is
wholly
mine
good
god
have
i
become
a
slave
where
i
hoped
to
be
master
have
i
thomas
cadwalader
given
my
soul
into
the
keeping
of
this
innocent
girl
i
do
not
even
stop
to
inquire
to
win
her
that
is
all
for
which
i
now
live
letter
dear
felix
she
may
not
care
for
me
but
she
is
interested
in
no
one
else
of
this
i
am
assured
by
john
poindexter
who
seems
very
desirous
of
aiding
me
in
my
attempt
to
win
his
daughter
heart
hard
won
close
bound
if
she
ever
comes
to
love
me
it
will
be
with
the
force
of
a
very
strong
nature
the
pale
blonde
has
a
heart
yours
thomas
entry
if
it
were
passion
only
that
i
feel
i
might
have
some
hope
of
restraining
it
but
it
is
something
more
something
deeper
something
which
constrains
me
to
look
with
her
eyes
hear
with
her
ears
and
throb
with
her
heart
my
soul
rather
than
my
senses
is
enthralled
i
want
to
win
her
not
for
my
own
satisfaction
but
to
make
her
happy
i
want
to
prove
to
her
that
goodness
exists
in
this
world
i
who
came
here
to
corrode
and
destroy
i
who
am
still
pledged
to
do
so
ah
felix
felix
you
should
have
chosen
an
older
man
for
your
purpose
or
remembered
that
he
who
could
be
influenced
as
i
was
by
family
affections
possesses
a
heart
too
soft
for
such
infamy
entry
vi
the
name
of
evelyn
is
never
mentioned
in
this
house
sometimes
i
think
that
he
has
forgotten
her
and
find
in
this
thought
the
one
remaining
spur
to
my
revenge
forgotten
her
strange
that
his
child
born
long
after
his
victim
death
should
remember
this
poor
girl
and
he
forget
yet
on
the
daughter
the
blow
is
planned
to
fall
if
it
does
fall
should
i
not
pray
that
it
never
may
that
she
should
loathe
instead
of
love
me
distrust
instead
of
confide
in
my
honor
and
affection
but
who
can
pray
against
himself
eva
poindexter
must
love
me
even
if
i
am
driven
to
by
my
own
remorse
after
she
has
confided
her
heart
to
my
keeping
letter
vi
dear
felix
will
you
send
me
a
few
exquisite
articles
from
tiffany
i
see
that
her
father
expects
me
to
give
her
presents
i
think
she
will
accept
them
if
she
does
we
may
both
rest
easy
as
to
the
state
of
her
affections
very
truly
thomas
entry
vii
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
pass
a
whole
day
away
from
her
side
if
felix
were
here
and
could
witness
my
assiduity
he
would
commend
me
in
his
cold
and
inflexible
heart
for
the
singleness
with
which
i
pursue
my
purpose
he
would
say
to
me
in
the
language
of
one
of
his
letters
you
are
not
disappointing
us
us
as
if
our
father
still
hovered
near
sharing
our
purposes
and
hope
alas
if
he
does
he
must
penetrate
more
deeply
than
felix
into
the
heart
of
this
matter
must
see
that
with
every
day
advantage
and
i
now
think
each
day
brings
its
advantage
i
shrink
further
and
further
from
the
end
they
planned
for
me
the
end
which
can
alone
justify
my
advance
in
her
affections
i
am
a
traitor
to
my
oath
for
i
now
know
i
shall
never
disappoint
eva
faith
in
me
i
could
not
rather
would
i
meet
my
father
accusing
eyes
on
the
verge
of
that
strange
world
to
which
he
has
gone
or
felix
recriminations
here
or
my
own
contempt
for
the
weakness
which
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
draw
back
from
the
brink
of
this
wicked
revenge
to
which
i
have
devoted
myself
letter
vii
dear
felix
this
morning
i
passed
under
the
window
you
have
described
to
me
as
evelyn
i
did
it
with
a
purpose
i
wanted
to
test
my
own
emotions
and
to
see
how
much
feeling
it
would
arouse
in
me
enough
eva
accepted
the
brooch
it
was
the
simplest
thing
you
sent
thomas
entry
viii
i
hate
john
poindexter
yes
i
hate
him
but
i
can
never
hate
his
daughter
only
felix
could
so
confound
the
father
with
the
child
as
to
visit
his
anger
upon
this
gentle
embodiment
of
all
that
is
gracious
all
that
is
trustworthy
all
that
is
fascinating
in
woman
but
am
i
called
upon
to
hate
her
am
i
not
in
a
way
required
to
love
her
i
will
ask
felix
no
i
can
not
ask
felix
he
would
never
comprehend
her
charm
or
its
influence
over
me
he
would
have
doubts
and
come
at
once
to
montgomery
good
god
am
i
proving
such
a
traitor
to
my
own
flesh
and
blood
that
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
felix
contemplating
even
in
secret
the
unsuspicious
form
of
his
enemy
daughter
letter
viii
dear
felix
a
picnic
on
the
mountains
it
fell
to
me
to
escort
miss
poindexter
down
a
dangerous
slope
though
no
words
of
affection
passed
between
us
she
is
not
yet
ready
for
them
i
feel
that
i
have
made
a
decided
advance
in
her
good
graces
yours
thomas
entry
ix
i
have
touched
her
hand
i
have
felt
her
sweet
form
thrilling
against
mine
as
we
descended
the
mountain
ledges
together
no
man
was
near
no
eye
there
were
moments
in
which
we
were
as
much
alone
in
the
wide
paradise
of
these
wooded
slopes
as
if
the
world
held
no
other
breathing
soul
yet
i
no
more
dared
to
press
her
hand
or
pour
forth
the
mad
worship
of
my
heart
into
her
innocent
ears
than
if
the
eyes
of
all
paris
had
been
upon
us
how
i
love
her
how
far
off
and
faint
seem
the
years
of
that
dead
crime
my
brother
would
invoke
for
the
punishment
of
this
sweet
soul
yes
and
how
remote
that
awful
hour
in
which
i
knelt
beneath
the
hand
of
my
dying
father
and
swore
ah
that
oath
that
oath
entry
x
the
thing
i
dreaded
the
thing
i
might
have
foreseen
has
occurred
felix
has
made
his
appearance
in
montgomery
i
received
a
communication
to
that
effect
from
him
a
communication
in
which
he
commands
me
to
meet
him
at
evelyn
grave
at
the
witching
hour
of
twelve
i
do
not
enjoy
the
summons
i
have
a
dread
of
felix
and
begin
to
think
he
calculates
upon
stage
devices
to
control
me
but
the
day
has
passed
for
that
i
will
show
him
that
i
can
be
no
more
influenced
in
that
place
and
at
that
hour
than
i
could
be
in
this
hotel
room
with
the
sight
of
her
little
glove
is
there
sin
in
such
thefts
lying
on
the
table
before
us
evelyn
she
is
a
sacred
memory
but
the
dead
must
not
interfere
with
the
living
eva
shall
never
be
sacrificed
to
manes
not
if
john
poindexter
lives
out
his
life
to
his
last
hour
in
peace
not
if
felix
well
i
need
to
play
the
man
felix
is
a
formidable
antagonist
to
meet
alone
in
a
spot
of
such
rancorous
memories
at
an
hour
when
spirits
if
there
be
spirits
haunt
the
precincts
of
the
tomb
entry
xi
i
should
not
have
known
felix
had
i
met
him
in
the
street
how
much
of
a
stranger
he
appeared
then
in
the
faint
moonlight
which
poured
upon
that
shaded
spot
his
very
voice
seemed
altered
and
in
his
manner
i
remarked
a
hesitation
i
had
not
supposed
him
capable
of
showing
under
any
circumstances
nor
were
his
words
such
as
i
expected
the
questions
i
dreaded
most
he
did
not
ask
the
recriminations
i
looked
for
he
did
not
utter
he
only
told
me
coldly
that
my
courtship
must
be
shortened
that
the
end
for
which
we
were
both
prepared
must
be
hastened
and
gave
me
two
weeks
in
which
to
bring
matters
to
a
climax
then
he
turned
to
evelyn
grave
and
bending
down
tried
to
read
her
name
on
the
mossy
stone
he
was
so
long
in
doing
this
that
i
leaned
down
beside
him
and
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
was
trembling
and
his
body
was
as
cold
as
the
stone
he
threw
himself
against
was
it
the
memory
of
her
whom
that
stone
covered
which
had
aroused
this
emotion
if
so
it
was
but
natural
to
all
appearance
he
has
never
in
all
his
life
loved
any
one
as
he
did
this
unhappy
sister
and
struck
with
a
respect
for
the
grief
which
has
outlived
many
a
man
lifetime
i
was
shrinking
back
when
he
caught
my
hand
and
with
a
convulsive
strain
contrasting
strongly
with
his
tone
which
was
strangely
measured
he
cried
do
not
forget
the
end
do
not
forget
john
poindexter
his
sin
his
indifference
to
my
father
grief
the
accumulated
sufferings
of
years
which
made
amos
cadwalader
a
hermit
amongst
men
i
have
seen
the
girl
she
has
changed
women
do
change
at
her
age
and
some
men
i
do
not
say
you
but
some
men
might
think
her
beautiful
but
beauty
if
she
has
it
must
not
blind
your
eyes
which
are
fixed
upon
another
goal
overlook
it
overlook
her
you
have
done
so
have
you
not
pale
beauties
can
not
move
one
who
has
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
most
dazzling
of
parisian
women
keep
your
eyes
on
john
poindexter
the
debt
he
owes
us
and
the
suffering
we
have
promised
him
that
she
is
sweet
gentle
different
from
all
we
thought
her
only
makes
the
chances
of
reaching
his
heart
the
greater
the
worthier
she
may
be
of
affections
not
indigenous
to
that
hard
soul
the
surer
will
be
our
grip
upon
his
nature
and
the
heavier
his
downfall
the
old
spell
was
upon
me
i
could
neither
answer
nor
assert
myself
letting
go
my
hand
he
rose
and
with
his
back
to
the
village
i
noticed
he
had
not
turned
his
face
to
it
since
coming
to
this
spot
he
said
i
shall
return
to
new
york
in
two
weeks
you
will
telegraph
your
readiness
to
take
up
your
abode
with
me
i
have
a
home
that
will
satisfy
you
and
it
will
soon
be
all
your
own
here
he
gripped
his
heart
and
dark
as
it
was
i
detected
a
strange
convulsion
cross
his
features
as
he
turned
into
the
moonlight
but
it
was
gone
before
we
could
descend
you
may
hear
from
me
again
he
remarked
somewhat
faintly
as
he
grasped
my
hand
and
turned
away
in
his
own
direction
i
had
not
spoken
a
word
during
the
whole
interview
letter
ix
dear
felix
i
do
not
hear
from
you
are
you
well
or
did
your
journey
affect
your
health
i
have
no
especial
advance
to
report
john
poindexter
seems
greatly
interested
in
my
courtship
sometimes
he
gives
me
very
good
advice
how
does
that
strike
you
felix
thomas
entry
xii
i
shall
never
understand
felix
he
has
not
left
the
town
but
is
staying
here
in
hiding
watching
me
no
doubt
to
see
if
the
signs
of
weakening
he
doubtless
suspects
in
me
have
a
significance
deep
enough
to
overthrow
his
planned
revenge
i
know
this
because
i
have
seen
him
more
than
once
during
the
last
week
when
he
thought
himself
completely
invisible
i
have
caught
sight
of
him
in
poindexter
grounds
when
eva
and
i
stood
talking
together
in
the
window
i
even
saw
him
once
in
church
in
a
dark
corner
to
be
sure
but
where
he
could
keep
his
eye
upon
us
sitting
together
in
poindexter
pew
he
seemed
to
me
thin
that
day
the
suspense
he
is
under
is
wearing
upon
him
is
it
my
duty
to
cut
it
short
by
proclaiming
my
infidelity
to
my
oath
and
my
determination
to
marry
the
girl
who
has
made
me
forget
it
letter
dear
felix
miss
poindexter
has
told
me
unreservedly
that
she
cares
for
me
are
you
satisfied
with
me
now
in
haste
thomas
entry
xiii
she
loves
me
oh
ecstasy
of
life
eva
poindexter
loves
me
i
forced
it
from
her
lips
with
my
arms
around
her
and
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
urged
her
to
confession
and
it
came
now
let
felix
do
what
he
will
what
is
old
john
poindexter
to
me
her
father
what
are
amos
cadwalader
hatred
and
the
mortal
wrong
that
called
so
loudly
for
revenge
dead
issues
long
buried
sorrows
which
god
may
remember
but
which
men
are
bound
to
forget
life
life
with
her
that
is
the
future
toward
which
i
look
that
is
the
only
vengeance
i
will
take
the
only
vengeance
evelyn
can
demand
if
she
is
the
angel
we
believe
her
i
will
write
to
felix
entry
xiv
i
have
not
written
felix
i
had
not
the
courage
entry
xv
i
have
had
a
dream
i
thought
i
saw
the
meeting
of
my
father
with
the
white
shade
of
evelyn
in
the
unimaginable
recesses
of
that
world
to
which
both
have
gone
strange
horrors
stranger
glories
met
as
their
separate
paths
crossed
and
when
the
two
forms
had
greeted
and
parted
a
line
of
light
followed
the
footsteps
of
the
one
and
a
trail
of
gloom
those
of
the
other
as
their
ways
divided
i
heard
my
father
cry
there
is
no
spot
on
your
garments
evelyn
can
it
be
that
the
wrongs
of
earth
are
forgotten
here
that
mortals
remember
what
the
angels
forget
and
that
our
revenge
is
late
for
one
so
blessed
i
did
not
hear
the
answer
for
i
woke
but
the
echo
of
those
words
has
rung
in
my
ears
all
day
is
our
revenge
late
for
one
so
blessed
entry
xvi
i
have
summoned
up
courage
felix
has
been
here
again
and
the
truth
has
at
last
been
spoken
between
us
i
had
been
pressing
eva
to
name
our
wedding
day
and
we
were
all
standing
that
is
john
poindexter
my
dear
girl
and
myself
in
the
glare
of
the
lights
when
i
heard
a
groan
too
faint
for
other
ears
to
catch
followed
by
a
light
fall
from
the
window
overlooking
the
garden
it
was
felix
he
had
been
watching
us
had
seen
my
love
heard
me
talk
of
marriage
and
must
now
be
in
the
grounds
in
open
frenzy
or
secret
satisfaction
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
determined
to
know
determined
to
speak
i
excused
myself
on
some
hurried
plea
and
searched
the
paths
he
knew
as
well
as
i
at
last
i
came
upon
him
he
was
standing
near
an
old
dial
where
he
had
more
than
once
seen
eva
and
me
together
he
was
very
pale
deathly
pale
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
faint
starlight
shining
upon
that
open
place
but
he
greeted
me
as
usual
very
quietly
and
with
no
surprise
almost
in
fact
as
if
he
knew
i
would
recognize
his
presence
and
follow
him
you
are
playing
your
rôle
well
said
he
too
well
what
was
that
i
heard
about
your
marrying
the
time
had
come
i
was
determined
to
meet
it
with
a
man
courage
but
i
found
it
hard
felix
is
no
easy
man
to
cross
even
in
small
things
and
this
thing
is
his
life
nay
more
his
past
present
and
future
existence
i
do
not
know
who
spoke
first
there
was
some
stammering
a
few
broken
words
then
i
heard
myself
saying
distinctly
and
with
a
certain
hard
emphasis
born
of
the
restraint
i
put
upon
myself
i
love
her
i
want
to
marry
her
you
must
allow
this
then
i
could
not
proceed
i
felt
the
shock
he
had
received
almost
as
if
it
had
been
communicated
to
me
by
contact
something
that
was
not
of
the
earth
seemed
to
pass
between
us
and
i
remember
raising
my
hand
as
if
to
shield
my
face
and
then
whether
it
was
the
blowing
aside
of
some
branches
which
kept
the
moonlight
from
us
or
because
my
eyesight
was
made
clearer
by
my
emotion
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
face
and
became
conscious
of
a
great
suffering
which
at
first
seemed
the
wrenching
of
my
own
heart
but
in
another
moment
impressed
itself
upon
me
as
that
of
his
felix
i
stood
appalled
my
weakness
had
uprooted
the
one
hope
of
his
life
or
so
i
thought
and
that
he
expressed
this
by
silence
made
my
heart
yearn
toward
him
for
the
first
time
since
i
recognized
him
as
my
brother
i
tried
to
stammer
some
excuse
i
was
glad
when
the
darkness
fell
again
for
the
sight
of
his
bowed
head
and
set
features
was
insupportable
to
me
it
seemed
to
make
it
easier
for
me
to
talk
for
me
to
dilate
upon
the
purity
the
goodness
which
had
robbed
me
of
my
heart
in
spite
of
myself
my
heart
it
seemed
a
strange
word
to
pass
between
us
two
in
reference
to
a
poindexter
but
it
was
the
only
one
capable
of
expressing
the
feeling
i
had
for
this
young
girl
at
last
driven
to
frenzy
by
his
continued
silence
which
had
something
strangely
moving
in
it
i
cried
you
have
never
loved
a
woman
felix
you
do
not
know
what
the
passion
is
when
it
seizes
upon
a
man
jaded
with
the
hollow
pleasures
of
an
irresponsible
life
you
can
not
judge
therefore
you
can
not
excuse
you
are
made
of
iron
hush
it
was
the
first
word
he
had
spoken
since
i
had
opened
my
heart
to
him
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
thomas
like
all
egotists
you
think
yourself
alone
in
experience
and
suffering
will
you
think
so
when
i
tell
you
that
there
was
a
time
in
my
life
when
i
did
not
sleep
for
weeks
when
the
earth
the
air
yes
and
the
heavens
were
full
of
nothing
but
her
name
her
face
her
voice
when
to
have
held
her
in
my
arms
to
have
breathed
into
her
ear
one
word
of
love
to
have
felt
her
cheek
fall
against
mine
in
confidence
in
passion
in
hope
would
have
been
to
me
the
heaven
which
would
have
driven
the
devils
from
my
soul
forever
thomas
will
you
believe
i
do
not
know
the
uttermost
of
all
you
are
experiencing
when
i
here
declare
to
you
that
there
has
been
an
hour
in
my
life
when
if
i
had
felt
she
could
have
been
brought
to
love
me
i
would
have
sacrificed
evelyn
my
own
soul
our
father
hope
john
poindexter
punishment
and
become
the
weak
thing
you
are
and
gloried
in
it
i
felix
cadwalader
the
man
of
iron
who
has
never
been
known
to
falter
but
thomas
i
overcame
that
feeling
i
crushed
down
that
love
and
i
call
upon
you
to
do
the
same
you
may
marry
her
but
what
stopped
him
his
own
heart
or
my
own
impetuosity
both
perhaps
for
at
that
moment
i
fell
at
his
feet
and
seizing
his
hand
kissed
it
as
i
might
a
woman
he
seemed
to
grow
cold
and
stiff
under
this
embrace
which
showed
both
the
delirium
i
was
laboring
under
and
the
relief
i
had
gotten
from
his
words
when
he
withdrew
his
hand
i
feel
that
my
doom
was
about
to
be
spoken
and
i
was
not
wrong
it
came
in
these
words
thomas
i
have
yielded
to
your
importunity
and
granted
you
the
satisfaction
which
under
the
same
circumstances
i
would
have
denied
myself
but
it
has
not
made
me
less
hard
toward
you
indeed
the
steel
with
which
you
say
my
heart
is
bound
seems
tightening
about
it
as
if
the
momentary
weakness
in
which
i
have
indulged
called
for
revenge
thomas
go
on
your
way
make
the
girl
your
wife
i
had
rather
you
would
since
she
is
what
she
is
but
after
she
has
taken
your
name
after
she
believes
herself
secure
in
her
honorable
position
and
your
love
then
you
are
to
remember
our
compact
and
your
oath
back
upon
john
poindexter
care
she
is
to
be
thrown
shortly
curtly
without
explanation
or
excuse
and
if
it
costs
you
your
life
you
are
to
stand
firm
in
this
attitude
using
but
one
weapon
in
the
struggle
which
may
open
between
you
and
her
father
and
that
is
your
name
of
cadwalader
you
will
not
need
any
other
thomas
do
you
swear
to
this
or
must
i
direct
my
own
power
against
eva
poindexter
and
by
telling
her
your
motive
in
courting
her
make
her
hate
you
forever
i
will
swear
i
cried
overpowered
by
the
alternative
with
which
he
threatened
me
give
me
the
bliss
of
calling
her
mine
and
i
will
follow
your
wishes
in
all
that
concerns
us
thereafter
you
will
there
was
a
sinister
tone
in
this
ejaculation
that
gave
a
shock
to
my
momentary
complacency
but
we
are
so
made
that
an
anticipated
evil
affects
us
less
than
an
immediate
one
and
remembering
that
weeks
must
yet
elapse
during
which
he
or
john
poindexter
or
even
myself
might
die
i
said
nothing
and
he
went
icily
on
i
give
you
two
months
alone
and
untrammelled
then
you
are
to
bring
your
bride
to
my
house
there
to
hear
my
final
decision
there
is
to
be
no
departure
from
this
course
i
shall
expect
you
thomas
you
and
her
you
can
say
that
you
are
going
to
make
her
acquainted
with
your
brother
i
will
be
there
i
murmured
feeling
a
greater
oppression
than
when
i
took
the
oath
at
my
father
i
will
be
there
there
was
no
answer

married
she
is

and
now
to
confront

my
determination

hold
on
to
my
happiness
how
i
love
her
and
how
i
pity
him
john

wickedness
is
forgotten

but
a
fading
memory
the
whole
world

to
hold
but
three
persons
eva
felix
and
myself
how
will
it
end
we
meet
at
his
home
chapter
iv
felix
meanwhile
there
was
another
secret
struggle
going
on
in
the
depth
of
a
nature
from
which
all
sympathy
was
excluded
both
by
the
temperament
of
the
person
concerned
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
him
i
can
but
hint
at
it
some
tragedies
lie
beyond
the
ken
of
man
and
this
one
we
can
but
gather
from
stray
scraps
of
letters
addressed
to
no
one
and
betraying
their
authorship
only
through
the
writer
hand
they
were
found
long
after
the
mystery
of
felix
cadwalader
death
had
been
fully
accounted
for
tucked
away
under
the
flooring
of
room
where
or
how
procured
by
him
who
can
tell
madness
i
have
seen
eva
poindexter
again
and
heaven
and
hell
have
contended
for
me
ever
since
eva
eva
the
girl
i
thought
of
only
as
our
prey
the
girl
i
have
given
to
my
brother
she
is
too
lovely
for
him
she
is
too
lovely
for
any
man
unless
it
be
one
who
has
never
before
thrilled
to
any
woman
voice
or
seen
a
face
that
could
move
his
passions
or
awaken
his
affection
is
it
love
i
feel
can
i
felix
who
have
had
but
one
thought
known
but
one
enthusiasm
retain
in
this
breast
of
iron
a
spot
however
secret
however
small
which
any
woman
least
of
all
his
daughter
could
reach
never
i
am
the
prey
of
frenzy
or
the
butt
of
devils
yet
only
the
inhabitants
of
a
more
celestial
sphere
brighten
around
me
when
i
think
of
those
eyes
those
delicately
parted
lips
so
devoid
of
guile
that
innocent
bearing
and
the
divine
tenderness
mingled
with
strength
by
which
she
commands
admiration
and
awakens
love
i
must
fly
i
must
never
see
her
again
thomas
purpose
is
steady
he
must
never
see
that
mine
rocks
like
an
idol
smitten
by
a
thunderbolt
if
thomas
had
not
been
reared
in
paris
he
too
but
i
am
the
only
weak
one
curses
on
my
did
i
say
i
would
fly
i
can
not
not
yet
one
more
glimpse
of
her
face
if
only
to
satisfy
myself
that
i
have
reason
for
this
madness
perhaps
i
was
but
startled
yesterday
to
find
a
celestial
loveliness
where
i
expected
to
encounter
pallid
inanity
if
my
emotion
is
due
to
my
own
weakness
rather
than
to
her
superiority
i
had
better
recognize
my
folly
before
it
proves
my
destruction
i
will
stay
and
thomas
will
not
shall
not
dexter
daughter
hate
hate
for
thom
my
is
restored
i
have
seen
her
again
him
they
were
together
there
was
true
love
in
his
eye
how
could
i
expect
him
not
to
love
her
and
i
was
able
to
hide
my
anguish
and
impose
his
duty
on
him
she
loves
him
or
he
thinks
so
and
the
work
goes
on
but
i
will
not
stay
to
watch
its
accomplishment
no
no
i
told
him
my
story
under
the
guise
of
a
past
experience
oh
the
devils
must
laugh
at
us
men
they
have
reason
to
sometimes
i
wonder
if
my
father
in
the
clearness
of
his
new
vision
does
not
join
them
in
their
mirth
home
with
my
unhappy
secret
home
where
nothing
comes
to
distract
me
from
my
gnawing
griefs
and
almost
intolerable
thoughts
i
walk
the
floors
i
cry
aloud
her
name
i
cry
it
even
under
the
portrait
of
evelyn
there
are
moments
when
i
am
tempted
to
write
to
thomas
to
forbid
him
eva
eva
eva
every
fibre
in
my
miserable
body
utters
the
one
word
but
no
man
shall
ever
know
thomas
shall
never
know
how
the
thought
of
her
fills
my
days
and
nights
making
my
life
a
torment
and
the
future
i
wait
for
his
letters
scanty
they
are
and
cold
as
the
doomed
criminal
awaits
his
executioner
does
she
really
love
him
or
will
that
exquisite
that
soulful
nature
call
for
a
stronger
mate
a
more
concentrated
temperament
a
a
i
thought
i
saw
in
one
of
my
dark
hours
my
father
rising
up
from
his
grave
to
curse
me
oh
he
might
curse
on
if
what
have
i
said
about
no
man
knowing
bartow
knows
in
his
dumbness
his
deafness
he
has
surprised
my
secret
and
shows
that
he
has
done
so
by
his
peering
looks
his
dissatisfied
ways
and
a
jealousy
at
which
i
could
shout
aloud
in
mirth
if
i
were
not
more
tempted
to
shriek
aloud
in
torment
a
dumb
picked
up
i
have
almost
forgotten
where
jealous
of
my
weakness
for
john
poindexter
daughter
he
was
never
jealous
of
my
feeling
for
evelyn
yet
till
the
day
i
dared
fate
by
seeking
out
and
looking
for
the
second
time
upon
the
woman
whose
charms
i
had
scorned
her
name
often
resounded
through
these
rooms
and
my
eyes
dwelt
upon
but
one
spot
and
that
was
where
her
picture
hangs
in
the
woeful
beauty
which
has
become
my
reproach
i
have
had
a
great
surprise
the
starling
which
has
been
taught
to
murmur
evelyn
name
shrieked
out
eva
my
first
impulse
was
to
wring
its
neck
my
next
to
take
it
from
its
cage
and
hide
it
in
my
bosom
but
i
did
neither
i
am
still
a
man
bartow
will
wring
that
bird
neck
if
i
do
not
this
morning
i
caught
him
with
his
hand
on
the
cage
and
a
murderous
light
in
his
eye
which
i
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
yet
he
can
not
hear
the
word
the
wretched
starling
murmurs
he
only
knows
it
is
a
word
a
name
and
he
is
determined
to
suppress
it
shall
i
string
the
cage
up
out
of
this
old
fellow
reach
his
deafness
his
inability
to
communicate
with
others
the
exactness
with
which
he
obeys
my
commands
as
given
him
by
my
colored
slides
his
attention
to
my
every
wish
consequent
upon
his
almost
animal
love
for
my
person
are
necessary
to
me
now
while
the
bird
ah
there
it
goes
again
eva
is
it
hate
or
love
i
feel
abhorrence
or
passion
love
would
seek
to
save
but
i
have
no
thought
of
saving
her
since
she
has
acknowledged
her
love
for
thomas
and
since
he
oh
it
is
not
now
for
evelyn
sake
i
plan
revenge
but
for
my
own
these
nights
and
days
of
torture
the
revelation
i
have
had
of
my
own
nature
the
consent
i
was
forced
to
give
to
a
marriage
which
means
bliss
to
them
and
anguish
beyond
measure
to
me
all
this
calls
for
vengeance
and
they
will
not
escape
these
two
i
have
laid
my
plans
deep
i
have
provided
for
every
contingency
it
has
taken
time
thought
money
but
the
result
is
good
if
they
cross
the
threshold
of
my
circular
study
they
must
consent
to
my
will
or
perish
here
and
i
with
them
oh
they
shall
never
live
and
be
happy
thomas
need
not
think
it
john
poindexter
need
not
think
it
i
might
have
forgotten
the
oath
made
on
my
father
crossed
arms
but
i
will
never
forget
the
immeasurable
griefs
of
these
past
months
or
the
humiliation
they
have
brought
me
my
own
weakness
is
to
be
avenged
my
my
intolerable
weakness
remember
evelyn
remember
felix
ah
again
eva
eva
eva
chapter
why
the
iron
slide
remained
stationary
the
rest
must
be
told
in
thomas
own
words
as
it
forms
the
chief
part
of
the
confession
he
made
before
the
detectives
according
to
my
promise
i
took
my
young
wife
to
felix
house
on
the
day
and
at
the
hour
proposed
we
went
on
foot
for
it
was
not
far
from
the
hotel
where
we
were
then
staying
and
were
received
at
the
door
by
an
old
servant
who
i
had
been
warned
could
neither
speak
nor
hear
at
sight
of
him
and
the
dim
hall
stretching
out
in
aristocratic
gloom
before
us
eva
turned
pale
and
cast
me
an
inquiring
look
but
i
reassured
her
with
a
smile
that
most
certainly
contradicted
my
own
secret
dread
of
the
interview
before
us
and
taking
her
on
my
arm
followed
the
old
man
down
the
hall
past
the
open
door
where
i
certainly
thought
we
should
pause
into
a
room
whose
plain
appearance
made
me
frown
till
bartow
as
i
have
since
heard
him
called
threw
aside
the
portière
at
one
end
and
introduced
us
into
my
study
which
at
that
moment
looked
like
fairyland
or
would
have
if
felix
who
was
its
sole
occupant
had
not
immediately
drawn
our
attention
to
himself
by
the
remarkable
force
of
his
personality
never
so
impressive
as
at
that
moment
eva
to
whom
i
had
said
little
of
this
brother
certainly
nothing
which
would
lead
her
to
anticipate
seeing
either
so
handsome
a
man
or
one
of
such
mental
poise
and
imposing
character
looked
frightened
and
a
trifle
but
she
advanced
quite
bravely
toward
him
and
at
my
introduction
smiled
with
such
an
inviting
grace
that
i
secretly
expected
to
see
him
more
or
less
disarmed
by
it
and
perhaps
he
was
for
his
already
pale
features
turned
waxy
in
the
yellow
glare
cast
by
the
odd
lantern
over
our
heads
and
the
hand
he
had
raised
in
mechanical
greeting
fell
heavily
and
he
could
barely
stammer
out
some
words
of
welcome
these
would
have
seemed
quite
inadequate
to
the
occasion
if
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
her
face
had
not
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
was
not
without
feeling
though
she
little
realized
the
nature
of
that
feeling
or
how
her
very
life
for
happiness
is
life
was
trembling
in
the
balance
under
that
indomitable
will
i
who
did
know
or
thought
i
did
cast
him
an
imploring
glance
and
saying
that
i
had
some
explanations
to
make
asked
if
adams
might
not
rest
here
while
we
had
a
few
words
apart
he
answered
me
with
a
strange
look
did
he
feel
the
revolt
in
my
tone
and
understand
then
as
well
as
afterward
what
the
nature
of
my
compliance
had
been
i
shall
never
know
i
only
know
that
he
stopped
fumbling
with
some
small
object
on
the
table
before
him
and
bowing
with
a
sarcastic
grace
that
made
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
intercourse
with
him
feel
myself
his
inferior
even
in
size
led
the
way
to
a
small
door
i
had
failed
to
notice
up
to
this
moment
your
wife
will
find
it
more
comfortable
here
he
observed
with
slow
pauses
in
his
speech
that
showed
great
but
repressed
excitement
and
he
opened
the
door
into
what
had
the
appearance
of
a
small
but
elegant
what
we
have
to
say
can
not
take
long
adams
will
not
find
the
wait
tedious
no
she
smiled
with
a
natural
laugh
born
as
i
dare
hope
of
her
perfect
happiness
yet
she
could
not
but
have
considered
the
proceeding
strange
and
my
manner
as
well
as
his
scarcely
what
might
be
expected
from
a
bridegroom
introducing
his
bride
to
his
only
relative
i
will
call
you
i
began
but
the
vision
of
her
dimpled
face
above
the
great
cluster
of
roses
she
carried
made
me
forget
to
complete
my
sentence
and
the
door
closed
and
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
felix
he
was
breathing
easier
and
his
manner
seemed
more
natural
now
that
we
were
alone
yet
he
did
not
speak
but
cast
a
strange
if
not
inquiring
glance
about
the
room
the
weirdest
of
apartments
as
you
all
well
know
and
seeming
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
why
i
could
not
tell
led
the
way
up
to
the
large
table
which
from
the
first
had
appeared
to
exert
a
sort
of
uncanny
magnetism
upon
him
saying
come
further
away
i
need
air
breathing
place
in
this
close
room
and
so
must
you
besides
why
should
she
hear
what
we
have
to
say
she
will
know
the
worst
soon
enough
she
seems
a
woman
an
angel
i
began
but
he
stopped
me
with
an
imperious
gesture
we
will
not
discuss
your
wi
adams
he
protested
where
is
john
poindexter
at
the
hotel
i
rejoined
or
possibly
he
has
returned
home
i
no
longer
take
account
of
his
existence
felix
i
shall
never
leave
my
wife
i
had
rather
prove
recreant
to
the
oath
i
took
before
i
realized
the
worth
of
the
woman
whose
happiness
i
vowed
to
destroy
this
is
what
i
have
come
to
tell
you
make
it
easy
for
me
felix
you
are
a
man
who
has
loved
and
suffered
let
us
bury
the
past
let
us
had
i
hoped
i
could
move
him
perhaps
some
such
child
notion
had
influenced
me
up
to
this
moment
but
as
these
words
left
my
lips
nay
before
i
had
stumbled
through
them
i
perceived
by
the
set
look
of
his
features
which
were
as
if
cast
in
bronze
that
i
might
falter
but
that
he
was
firm
as
ever
firmer
it
seemed
to
me
and
less
easy
to
be
entreated
yet
what
of
that
at
the
worst
what
had
i
to
fear
a
struggle
which
might
involve
eva
in
bitter
unpleasantness
and
me
in
the
loss
of
a
fortune
i
had
come
to
regard
almost
as
my
own
but
these
were
petty
considerations
eva
must
know
sooner
or
later
my
real
name
and
the
story
of
her
father
guilt
why
not
now
and
if
we
must
start
life
poor
it
was
yet
life
while
a
separation
from
her
meanwhile
felix
had
spoken
and
in
language
i
was
least
prepared
to
hear
i
anticipated
this
from
the
moment
you
pleaded
with
me
for
the
privilege
of
marrying
her
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
outcome
and
provided
against
it
weakness
on
the
part
of
her
bridegroom
was
to
be
expected
i
have
therefore
steeled
myself
to
meet
the
emergency
for
your
oath
must
be
kept
crushed
by
the
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
a
tone
that
evinced
power
against
which
any
ordinary
struggle
would
end
in
failure
i
cast
my
eyes
about
the
room
in
imitation
of
what
i
had
seen
him
do
a
few
minutes
before
there
was
nothing
within
sight
calculated
to
awaken
distrust
and
yet
a
feeling
of
distrust
the
first
i
had
really
felt
had
come
with
the
look
he
had
thrown
above
and
around
the
interior
of
the
room
he
called
his
study
was
it
the
calm
confidence
he
showed
or
the
weirdness
of
finding
myself
amid
oriental
splendors
and
under
the
influence
of
night
effects
in
high
day
and
within
sound
of
the
clanging
street
cars
and
all
the
accompanying
bustle
of
traffic
it
is
hard
to
say
but
from
this
moment
on
i
found
myself
affected
by
a
vague
affright
not
on
my
own
account
but
on
hers
whose
voice
we
could
plainly
hear
humming
a
gay
tune
in
the
adjoining
apartment
but
i
was
resolved
to
suppress
all
betrayal
of
uneasiness
i
even
smiled
though
i
felt
the
eyes
of
evelyn
pictured
countenance
upon
me
evelyn
whose
portrait
i
had
never
lost
sight
of
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
room
though
i
had
not
given
it
a
direct
look
and
now
stood
with
my
back
to
it
felix
who
faced
it
but
who
did
not
raise
his
eyes
to
it
waited
a
moment
for
my
response
and
finding
that
my
words
halted
said
again
that
oath
must
be
kept
this
time
i
found
words
with
which
to
answer
impossible
i
burst
out
flinging
doubt
fear
hesitancy
everything
i
had
hitherto
trembled
at
to
the
winds
it
was
in
my
nature
to
take
it
worked
upon
as
i
was
by
family
affection
the
awfulness
of
our
father
approaching
death
and
a
thousand
uncanny
influences
all
carefully
measured
and
prepared
for
this
end
but
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
keep
it
after
four
months
of
natural
living
in
the
companionship
of
a
man
thirty
years
removed
from
his
guilt
and
of
his
guileless
and
wholly
innocent
daughter
and
you
can
not
drive
me
to
it
felix
no
man
can
force
another
to
abandon
his
own
wife
because
of
a
wicked
oath
taken
long
before
he
knew
her
if
you
think
your
money
money
he
cried
with
a
contempt
that
did
justice
to
my
disinterestedness
as
well
as
his
own
i
had
forgotten
i
had
it
no
thomas
i
should
never
weigh
money
against
the
happiness
of
living
with
such
a
woman
as
your
wife
appears
to
be
but
her
life
i
might
carry
out
your
threat
forget
to
pay
john
poindexter
the
debt
we
owe
him
and
the
matter
will
assume
a
seriousness
for
which
you
are
doubtless
poorly
prepared
a
daughter
dead
in
her
honeymoon
will
be
almost
as
great
a
grief
to
him
as
a
dishonored
one
and
either
dead
or
dishonored
he
must
find
her
when
he
comes
here
in
search
of
the
child
he
can
not
long
forget
which
shall
it
be
speak
was
i
dreaming
was
this
felix
was
this
myself
and
was
it
in
my
ears
these
words
were
poured
with
a
spring
i
reached
his
side
where
he
stood
close
against
the
table
and
groaned
rather
than
shrieked
the
words
you
would
not
kill
her
you
do
not
meditate
a
crime
of
blood
here
on
her
the
innocent
the
good
no
he
said
it
will
be
you
who
will
do
that
you
who
will
not
wish
to
see
her
languish
suffer
go
mad
thomas
i
am
not
the
raving
being
you
take
me
for
i
am
merely
a
keeper
of
oaths
nay
i
am
more
i
have
talents
skill
the
house
in
which
you
find
yourself
is
proof
of
this
this
room
see
it
has
no
outlet
save
those
windows
scarcely
if
at
all
perceptible
to
you
above
our
heads
and
that
opening
shielded
now
by
a
simple
curtain
but
which
in
an
instant
without
my
moving
from
this
place
i
can
so
hermetically
seal
that
no
man
save
he
be
armed
with
crowbar
and
pickaxe
could
enter
here
even
if
man
could
know
of
our
imprisonment
in
a
house
soon
to
be
closed
from
top
to
bottom
by
my
departing
servant
may
god
protect
us
fell
from
my
lips
as
stiff
with
horror
i
let
my
eyes
travel
from
his
determined
face
first
to
the
windows
high
over
my
head
and
then
to
the
opening
of
the
door
which
though
but
a
few
steps
from
where
i
stood
was
as
far
as
possible
from
the
room
into
which
my
darling
had
been
induced
to
enter
felix
watching
me
uttered
his
explanations
as
calmly
as
if
the
matter
were
one
of
significance
you
are
looking
for
the
windows
he
remarked
they
are
behind
those
goblin
faces
you
see
outlined
on
the
tapestries
under
the
ceiling
as
for
the
door
if
you
had
looked
to
the
left
when
you
entered
you
would
have
detected
the
edge
of
a
huge
steel
plate
hanging
flush
with
the
casing
this
plate
can
be
made
to
slide
across
that
opening
in
an
instant
just
by
the
touch
of
my
hand
on
this
button
this
done
no
power
save
such
as
i
have
mentioned
can
move
it
back
again
not
even
my
own
i
have
forces
at
my
command
for
sending
it
forward
but
none
for
returning
it
to
its
place
do
you
doubt
my
mechanical
skill
or
the
perfection
of
the
electrical
apparatus
i
have
caused
to
be
placed
here
you
need
not
thomas
nor
need
you
doubt
the
will
that
has
only
to
exert
itself
for
an
instant
to
shall
i
press
the
button
brother
no
no
i
shouted
in
a
frenzy
caused
rather
by
my
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
this
man
than
any
especial
threat
apparent
in
his
voice
or
gesture
let
me
think
let
me
know
more
fully
what
your
requirements
are
what
she
must
suffer
if
i
consent
and
what
i
he
let
his
hand
slip
back
that
smooth
white
hand
which
i
had
more
than
once
surveyed
in
admiration
then
he
smiled
i
knew
you
would
not
be
foolish
he
said
life
has
its
charms
even
for
hermits
like
me
and
for
a
such
as
you
are
hush
i
interposed
maddened
into
daring
his
full
anger
it
is
not
my
life
i
am
buying
but
hers
possibly
yours
for
it
seems
you
have
planned
to
perish
with
us
is
it
not
so
certainly
was
his
cold
reply
am
i
an
assassin
would
you
expect
me
to
live
knowing
you
to
be
perishing
i
stared
aghast
such
resolve
such
sacrifice
of
self
to
an
idea
was
beyond
my
comprehension
why
what
i
stammered
why
kill
us
why
kill
yourself
the
answer
overwhelmed
me
remember
evelyn
shrilled
a
voice
and
i
paused
struck
dumb
with
a
superstitious
horror
i
had
never
believed
myself
capable
of
experiencing
for
it
was
not
felix
who
spoke
neither
was
it
any
utterance
of
my
own
aroused
conscience
muffled
strange
and
startling
it
came
from
above
from
the
hollow
spaces
of
that
high
vault
lit
with
the
golden
glow
that
henceforth
can
have
but
one
meaning
for
me
death
what
is
it
i
asked
another
of
your
mechanical
contrivances
he
smiled
i
had
rather
he
had
frowned
not
exactly
a
favorite
bird
a
starling
alas
he
but
repeats
what
he
has
heard
echoed
through
the
solitude
of
these
rooms
i
thought
i
had
smothered
him
up
sufficiently
to
insure
his
silence
during
this
interview
but
he
is
a
bird
and
seems
disposed
to
defy
the
wrappings
i
have
bound
around
him
which
fact
warns
me
to
be
speedy
and
hasten
our
explanations
thomas
this
is
what
i
require
john
poindexter
you
do
not
know
where
he
is
at
this
hour
but
i
do
received
a
telegram
but
now
which
if
he
is
a
man
at
all
will
bring
him
to
this
house
in
a
or
so
from
the
present
moment
it
was
sent
in
your
name
and
in
it
you
informed
him
that
matters
had
arisen
which
demanded
his
immediate
attention
that
you
were
on
your
way
to
your
giving
him
this
address
where
if
you
found
entrance
you
would
await
his
presence
in
a
room
called
the
study
but
that
and
here
you
will
see
how
his
coming
will
not
aid
us
if
that
steel
plate
is
once
started
on
its
course
if
the
possible
should
occur
and
your
brother
should
be
absent
from
home
then
he
was
to
await
a
message
from
you
at
the
plaza
the
appearance
of
the
house
would
inform
him
whether
he
would
find
you
and
eva
within
or
so
i
telegraphed
him
in
your
name
thomas
if
bartow
fulfils
my
instructions
and
i
have
never
know
him
to
fail
me
he
will
pass
down
these
stairs
and
out
of
this
house
in
just
five
minutes
as
he
is
bound
on
a
journey
and
as
he
expects
me
to
leave
the
house
immediately
after
him
he
has
drawn
every
shade
and
fastened
every
lock
consequently
on
his
exit
the
house
will
become
a
tomb
to
which
just
two
weeks
from
john
poindexter
will
be
called
again
and
in
words
which
will
lead
to
a
demolition
which
will
disclose
what
let
us
not
forestall
the
future
our
horrible
future
by
inquiring
but
thomas
shall
bartow
go
shall
i
not
by
signs
he
comprehends
more
readily
than
other
men
comprehend
speech
indicate
to
him
on
his
downward
passage
to
the
street
that
i
wish
him
to
wait
and
open
the
door
to
the
man
whom
we
have
promised
to
overwhelm
in
his
hour
of
satisfaction
and
pride
you
have
only
to
write
a
line
see
i
have
made
a
copy
of
the
words
you
must
use
lest
your
should
be
too
severely
taxed
these
words
left
on
this
table
for
his
inspection
for
you
must
go
and
eva
remain
will
tell
him
all
he
needs
to
know
from
you
the
rest
can
come
from
my
lips
after
he
has
read
the
signature
which
in
itself
will
confound
him
and
prepare
the
way
for
what
i
have
to
add
have
you
anything
to
say
against
this
plan
anything
i
mean
beyond
what
you
have
hitherto
urged
anything
that
i
will
consider
or
which
will
prevent
my
finger
from
pressing
the
button
on
which
it
rests
i
took
up
the
paper
it
was
lying
on
the
table
where
it
had
evidently
been
inscribed
simultaneously
with
or
just
before
our
entrance
into
the
house
and
slowly
read
the
few
lines
i
saw
written
upon
it
you
know
them
but
they
will
acquire
a
new
significance
from
your
present
understanding
of
their
purpose
and
intent
i
return
you
back
your
daughter
neither
she
nor
you
will
ever
see
me
again
remember
evelyn
amos
son
you
wish
me
to
sign
these
words
to
put
them
into
my
own
handwriting
and
so
to
make
them
mine
mine
i
repeated
yes
and
to
leave
them
here
on
this
table
for
him
to
see
when
he
enters
he
might
not
believe
any
mere
statement
from
me
in
regard
to
your
intentions
i
was
filled
with
horror
love
life
human
hopes
the
friendships
all
the
possibilities
of
existence
swept
in
one
concentrated
flood
of
thought
and
feeling
through
my
outraged
consciousness
and
i
knew
i
could
never
put
my
name
to
such
a
blasphemy
of
all
that
was
sacred
to
man
soul
tossing
the
paper
in
his
face
i
cried
you
have
gone
too
far
better
her
death
better
mine
better
the
destruction
of
us
all
than
such
dishonor
to
the
purest
thing
heaven
ever
made
i
refuse
felix
i
refuse
and
may
god
have
mercy
on
us
all
the
moment
was
ghastly
i
saw
his
face
change
his
finger
tremble
where
it
hovered
above
the
fatal
button
saw
though
only
in
imagination
as
yet
the
steely
edge
of
that
deadly
plate
of
steel
advancing
beyond
the
lintel
and
was
about
to
dare
all
in
a
sudden
grapple
with
this
man
when
a
sound
from
another
direction
caught
my
ear
and
looking
around
in
terror
of
the
only
intrusion
we
could
fear
beheld
eva
advancing
from
the
room
in
which
we
had
placed
her
that
moment
a
glow
took
the
place
of
the
sickly
yellow
which
had
hitherto
filled
every
recess
of
this
weird
apartment
but
i
scarcely
noticed
the
change
save
as
it
affected
her
pallor
and
gave
to
her
cheeks
the
color
that
was
lacking
in
the
roses
at
her
belt
fearless
and
sweet
as
in
the
hour
when
she
first
told
me
that
she
loved
me
she
approached
and
stood
before
us
what
is
this
she
cried
i
have
heard
words
that
sound
more
like
the
utterances
of
some
horrid
dream
than
the
talk
of
men
and
brothers
what
does
it
mean
thomas
what
does
it
mean
cadwalader
announced
felix
dropping
his
eyes
from
her
face
but
changing
not
a
whit
his
features
or
posture
cadwalader
the
name
was
not
to
her
what
it
was
to
her
father
cadwalader
i
have
heard
that
name
in
my
father
house
it
was
evelyn
name
the
evelyn
who
whom
you
see
painted
there
over
your
head
finished
felix
my
sister
thomas
sister
the
girl
whom
your
father
but
i
spare
you
child
though
you
be
of
a
man
who
spared
nothing
from
your
husband
you
may
learn
why
a
cadwalader
can
never
find
his
happiness
with
a
poindexter
why
thirty
or
more
years
after
that
young
girl
death
you
who
were
not
then
born
are
given
at
this
hour
the
choice
between
death
and
dishonor
i
allow
you
just
five
minutes
in
which
to
listen
after
that
you
will
let
me
know
your
joint
decision
only
you
must
make
your
talk
where
you
stand
a
step
taken
by
either
of
you
to
right
or
left
and
thomas
knows
what
will
follow
five
minutes
with
such
a
justification
to
make
and
such
a
decision
to
arrive
at
i
felt
my
head
swim
my
tongue
refuse
its
office
and
stood
dumb
and
helpless
before
her
till
the
sight
of
her
dear
eyes
raised
in
speechless
trust
to
mine
flooded
me
with
a
sense
of
triumph
amid
all
the
ghastly
terrors
of
the
moment
and
i
broke
out
in
a
tumult
of
speech
in
excuses
explanations
all
that
comes
to
one
in
a
more
than
mortal
crisis
she
listened
catching
my
meaning
rather
from
my
looks
than
my
words
then
as
the
minutes
fled
and
my
brother
raised
a
warning
hand
she
turned
toward
him
and
said
you
are
in
earnest
we
must
separate
in
shame
or
perish
in
this
with
you
his
answer
was
mere
repetition
mechanical
but
firm
you
have
said
it
you
have
but
one
minute
more
madam
she
shrank
and
all
her
powers
seemed
leaving
her
then
a
reaction
came
and
a
flaming
angel
stood
where
but
a
moment
before
the
most
delicate
of
women
weakly
faltered
and
giving
me
a
look
to
see
if
i
had
the
courage
or
the
will
to
lift
my
hand
against
my
own
flesh
and
blood
alas
for
us
both
i
did
not
understand
her
caught
up
an
old
turkish
dagger
lying
only
too
ready
to
her
hand
and
plunged
it
with
one
sideways
thrust
into
his
side
crying
we
can
not
part
we
can
not
die
we
are
too
young
too
happy
it
was
sudden
the
birth
of
purpose
in
her
so
unexpected
and
so
rapid
that
felix
the
ready
who
was
prepared
for
all
contingencies
for
the
least
movement
or
suggestion
of
escape
faltered
and
pressed
not
the
fatal
button
but
his
heart
one
impulsive
act
on
the
part
of
a
woman
had
overthrown
all
the
plans
of
the
subtlest
spirit
that
ever
attempted
to
work
its
will
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
but
i
did
not
think
of
this
then
i
did
not
even
bestow
a
thought
upon
the
narrowness
of
our
escape
or
the
price
which
the
darling
of
my
heart
might
be
called
upon
to
pay
for
this
supreme
act
of
my
mind
my
heart
my
interest
were
with
felix
in
whom
the
nearness
of
death
had
called
up
all
that
was
strongest
and
most
commanding
in
his
strong
and
commanding
spirit
though
struck
to
the
heart
he
had
not
fallen
it
was
as
if
the
will
which
had
sustained
him
through
thirty
years
of
mental
torture
held
him
erect
still
that
he
might
give
her
eva
one
look
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
on
mortal
face
and
which
will
never
leave
my
heart
or
hers
until
we
die
then
as
he
saw
her
sink
shudderingly
down
and
the
delicate
woman
reappear
in
her
pallid
and
shrunken
figure
he
turned
his
eyes
on
me
and
i
saw
good
god
a
tear
well
up
from
those
orbs
of
stone
and
fall
slowly
down
his
cheek
fast
growing
hollow
under
the
stroke
of
death
eva
eva
i
love
eva
shrilled
the
voice
which
once
before
had
startled
me
from
the
hollow
vault
above
felix
heard
and
a
smile
faint
as
the
failing
rush
of
blood
through
his
veins
moved
his
lips
and
brought
a
revelation
to
my
soul
he
too
loved
eva
when
he
saw
i
knew
the
will
which
had
kept
him
on
his
feet
gave
way
and
he
sank
to
the
floor
murmuring
take
her
away
i
forgive
save
save
she
did
not
know
i
loved
her
eva
aghast
staring
with
set
eyes
at
her
work
had
not
moved
from
her
crouching
posture
but
when
she
saw
that
speaking
head
fall
back
the
fine
limbs
settle
into
the
repose
of
death
a
shock
went
through
her
which
i
thought
would
never
leave
her
reason
unimpaired
i
killed
him
she
murmured
i
killed
him
and
looking
wildly
about
her
eyes
fell
on
the
cross
that
hung
behind
us
on
the
wall
it
seemed
to
remind
her
that
felix
was
a
catholic
bring
it
she
gasped
let
him
feel
it
on
his
breast
it
may
bring
him
peace
hope
as
i
rushed
to
do
her
bidding
she
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
save
came
again
from
the
lips
we
thought
closed
forever
in
death
and
realizing
at
the
words
both
her
danger
and
the
necessity
of
her
not
opening
her
eyes
again
upon
this
scene
i
laid
the
cross
in
his
arms
and
catching
her
up
from
the
floor
ran
with
her
out
of
the
house
but
no
sooner
had
i
caught
sight
of
the
busy
street
and
the
stream
of
humanity
passing
before
us
than
i
awoke
to
an
instant
recognition
of
our
peril
setting
my
wife
down
i
commanded
life
back
into
her
limbs
by
the
force
of
my
own
energy
and
then
dragging
her
down
the
steps
mingled
with
the
crowd
encouraging
her
breathing
for
her
living
in
her
till
i
got
her
into
a
carriage
and
we
drove
away
for
the
silence
we
have
maintained
from
that
time
to
this
you
must
not
blame
adams
when
she
came
to
herself
which
was
not
for
days
she
manifested
the
greatest
desire
to
proclaim
her
act
and
assume
its
responsibility
but
i
would
not
have
it
i
loved
her
too
dearly
to
see
her
name
bandied
about
in
the
papers
and
when
her
father
was
taken
into
our
confidence
he
was
equally
peremptory
in
enjoining
silence
and
shared
with
me
the
watch
i
now
felt
bound
to
keep
over
her
movements
but
alas
his
was
the
peremptoriness
of
pride
rather
than
love
john
poindexter
has
no
more
heart
for
his
daughter
than
he
had
for
his
wife
or
that
child
from
whose
grave
this
tragedy
has
sprung
had
felix
triumphed
he
would
never
have
wrung
the
heart
of
this
man
as
he
once
said
when
a
man
cares
for
nothing
and
nobody
not
even
for
himself
it
is
useless
to
curse
him
as
for
felix
himself
judge
him
not
when
you
realize
as
you
now
must
that
his
last
conscious
act
was
to
reach
for
and
put
in
his
mouth
the
paper
which
connected
eva
with
his
death
at
the
moment
of
death
his
thought
was
to
save
not
to
avenge
and
this
after
her
hand
had
struck
him
chapter
vi
answered
a
silence
more
or
less
surcharged
with
emotion
followed
this
final
appeal
then
while
the
various
auditors
of
this
remarkable
history
whispered
together
and
thomas
adams
turned
in
love
and
anxiety
toward
his
wife
the
inspector
handed
back
to
gryce
the
memorandum
he
had
received
from
him
it
presented
the
following
appearance
sidenote
answered
why
a
woman
who
was
calm
enough
to
stop
and
arrange
her
hair
during
the
beginning
of
an
interview
should
be
wrought
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
frenzy
and
exasperation
before
it
was
over
as
to
kill
with
her
own
hand
a
man
she
had
evidently
had
no
previous
grudge
against
remember
the
comb
found
on
the
floor
of
adams
bedroom
sidenote
answered
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
following
words
written
just
previous
to
this
interview
by
the
man
thus
killed
i
return
you
your
daughter
neither
you
nor
she
will
ever
see
me
again
remember
evelyn
sidenote
answered
why
was
the
pronoun
i
used
in
this
communication
what
position
did
felix
adams
hold
toward
this
young
girl
qualifying
him
to
make
use
of
such
language
after
her
marriage
to
his
brother
sidenote
answered
and
having
used
it
why
did
he
upon
being
attacked
by
her
attempt
to
swallow
the
paper
upon
which
he
had
written
these
words
actually
dying
with
it
clinched
between
his
teeth
sidenote
answered
if
he
was
killed
in
anger
and
died
as
monsters
do
her
own
word
why
did
his
face
show
sorrow
rather
than
hate
and
a
determination
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
rush
of
emotions
likely
to
follow
the
reception
of
a
mortal
blow
from
the
hand
of
an
unexpected
antagonist
sidenote
answered
why
if
he
had
strength
to
seize
the
paper
and
convey
it
to
his
lips
did
he
not
use
that
strength
in
turning
on
a
light
calculated
to
bring
him
assistance
instead
of
leaving
blazing
the
crimson
glow
which
according
to
the
code
of
signals
as
now
understood
by
us
means
nothing
more
required
just
now
keep
away
sidenote
answered
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
huge
steel
plate
found
between
the
casings
of
the
doorway
and
why
did
it
remain
at
rest
within
its
socket
at
this
the
culminating
moment
of
his
life
sidenote
answered
an
explanation
of
how
old
poindexter
came
to
appear
on
the
scene
so
soon
after
the
event
his
words
as
overheard
were
it
is
amos
son
not
amos
did
he
not
know
whom
he
was
to
meet
in
this
house
was
the
condition
of
the
man
lying
before
him
with
a
cross
on
his
bosom
and
a
dagger
in
his
heart
less
of
a
surprise
to
him
than
the
personality
of
the
victim
sidenote
not
answered
remember
the
conclusions
we
have
drawn
from
bartow
pantomime
adams
was
killed
by
a
thrust
watch
for
an
acknowledgment

the

is

do
not

that
an
explanation
is

for
so
long
a
time
she
held
her
other

stretched
out

the
story
of
this
tragedy
to
be
true
must
show
that
adams
knew
his
bride

long
and
well

answered
if
bartow
is
as
we
think
innocent
of
all
connection
with
this
crime
save
as
witness
why
does
he
show
such
joy
at
its
result
this
may
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
fall
within
the
scope
of
thomas
confession
but
it
should
not
be
ignored
by
us
this
servitor
was
driven
mad
by
the
fact
which
caused
him
joy
why
footnote
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
scraps
of
writing
in
hand
had
not
yet
been
found
by
the
police
the
allusions
in
them
to
bartow
show
him
to
have
been
possessed
by
a
jealousy
which
probably
turned
to
delight
when
he
saw
his
master
smitten
down
by
the
object
of
that
master
love
and
his
own
hatred
how
he
came
to
recognize
in
the
bride
of
another
man
the
owner
of
the
name
he
so
often
saw
hovering
on
the
lips
of
his
master
is
a
question
to
be
answered
by
more
astute
students
of
the
laws
of
perception
than
myself
probably
he
spent
much
of
his
time
at
the
loophole
on
the
stairway
studying
his
master
till
he
understood
his
every
gesture
and
expression

if

can
be

by
adams
account
of
the
same
two
paragraphs
alone
lacked
complete
explanation
the
first
no
was
important
the
description
of
the
stroke
dealt
by
adams
wife
did
not
account
for
this
peculiar
feature
in
bartow
pantomime
consulting
with
the
inspector
gryce
finally
approached
adams
and
inquired
if
he
had
strength
to
enact
before
them
the
blow
as
he
had
seen
it
dealt
by
his
wife
the
startled
young
man
looked
the
question
he
dared
not
ask
in
common
with
others
he
knew
that
bartow
had
made
some
characteristic
gestures
in
endeavoring
to
describe
this
crime
but
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
as
this
especial
bit
of
information
had
been
carefully
held
back
by
the
police
he
therefore
did
not
respond
hastily
to
the
suggestion
made
him
but
thought
intently
for
a
moment
before
he
thrust
out
his
left
hand
and
caught
up
some
article
or
other
from
the
inspector
table
and
made
a
lunge
with
it
across
his
body
into
an
imaginary
victim
at
his
right
then
he
consulted
the
faces
about
him
with
inexpressible
anxiety
he
found
little
encouragement
in
their
aspect
you
would
make
your
wife
out
suggested
gryce
now
i
have
been
watching
her
ever
since
she
came
into
this
place
and
i
have
seen
no
evidence
of
this
she
is
not
but
she
thrust
with
her
left
hand
because
her
right
was
fast
held
in
mine
i
had
seized
her
instinctively
as
she
bounded
forward
for
the
weapon
and
the
convulsive
clutch
of
our
two
hands
was
not
loosed
till
the
horror
of
her
act
made
her
faint
and
she
fell
away
from
me
to
the
floor
crying
down
the
cross
and
lay
it
on
your
brother
breast
i
would
at
least
see
him
die
the
death
of
a
christian
gryce
glanced
at
the
inspector
with
an
air
of
great
relief
the
mystery
of
the
constrained
attitude
of
the
right
hand
which
made
bartow
pantomime
so
remarkable
was
now
naturally
explained
and
taking
up
the
blue
pencil
which
the
inspector
had
laid
down
he
wrote
with
a
smile
a
very
decided
answered
across
paragraph
no
chapter
vii
last
words
a
few
minutes
later
gryce
was
to
be
seen
in
the
outer
room
gazing
curiously
at
the
various
persons
there
collected
he
was
seeking
an
answer
to
a
question
that
was
still
disturbing
his
mind
and
hoped
to
find
it
there
he
was
not
disappointed
for
in
a
quiet
corner
he
encountered
the
amiable
form
of
miss
butterworth
calmly
awaiting
the
result
of
an
interference
which
she
in
all
probability
had
been
an
active
agent
in
bringing
about
he
approached
and
smilingly
accused
her
of
this
but
she
disclaimed
the
fact
with
some
heat
i
was
simply
there
she
explained
when
the
crisis
came
when
this
young
creature
learned
that
her
husband
had
left
suddenly
for
new
york
in
the
company
of
two
men
then
why
then
it
became
apparent
to
every
one
that
a
woman
should
be
at
her
side
who
understood
her
case
and
the
extremity
in
which
she
found
herself
and
i
was
that
woman
you
are
always
that
woman
he
gallantly
replied
if
by
the
phrase
you
mean
being
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
so
you
are
already
acquainted
with
adams
story
yes
the
ravings
of
a
moment
told
me
she
was
the
one
who
had
handled
the
dagger
that
slew
adams
afterward
she
was
able
to
explain
the
cause
of
what
has
seemed
to
us
such
a
horrible
crime
when
i
heard
her
story
gryce
i
no
longer
hesitated
either
as
to
her
duty
or
mine
do
you
think
she
will
be
called
upon
to
answer
for
this
blow
will
she
be
tried
convicted
madam
there
are
not
twelve
men
in
the
city
so
devoid
of
intelligence
as
to
apply
the
name
of
crime
to
an
act
which
was
so
evidently
one
of
no
true
bill
will
be
found
against
young
adams
rest
easy
the
look
of
gloom
disappeared
from
miss
butterworth
eyes
then
i
may
return
home
in
peace
she
cried
it
has
been
a
desperate
five
hours
for
me
and
i
feel
well
shaken
up
will
you
escort
me
to
my
carriage
miss
butterworth
did
not
look
shaken
up
indeed
in
judgment
she
had
never
appeared
more
serene
or
more
comfortable
but
she
was
certainly
the
best
judge
of
her
own
condition
and
after
satisfying
herself
that
the
object
of
her
care
was
reviving
under
the
solicitous
ministrations
of
her
husband
she
took
the
arm
which
gryce
held
out
to
her
and
proceeded
to
her
carriage
as
he
assisted
her
in
he
asked
a
few
questions
about
poindexter
why
is
not
adams
father
here
did
he
allow
his
daughter
to
leave
him
on
such
an
errand
as
this
without
offering
to
accompany
her
the
answer
was
curtness
itself
poindexter
is
a
man
without
heart
he
came
with
us
to
new
york
but
refused
to
follow
us
to
police
headquarters
sir
you
will
find
that
the
united
passions
of
three
burning
souls
and
a
revenge
the
most
deeply
cherished
of
any
i
ever
knew
or
heard
of
have
been
thrown
away
on
a
man
who
is
positively
unable
to
suffer
do
not
mention
old
john
poindexter
to
me
and
now
if
you
will
be
so
good
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
me
to
my
home
in
gramercy
park
i
have
put
my
finger
in
the
police
pie
for
the
last
time
gryce
positively
for
the
last
time
and
she
sank
back
on
the
carriage
cushions
with
an
inexorable
look
which
nevertheless
did
not
quite
conceal
a
quiet
complacency
which
argued
that
she
was
not
altogether
dissatisfied
with
herself
or
the
result
of
her
interference
in
matters
usually
considered
at
variance
with
a
refined
woman
natural
instincts
gryce
in
repressing
a
smile
bowed
lower
even
than
his
wont
and
under
the
shadow
of
this
bow
the
carriage
drove
off
as
he
walked
slowly
back
he
sighed
was
he
wondering
if
a
case
of
similar
interest
would
ever
bring
them
together
again
in
consultation
the
end
