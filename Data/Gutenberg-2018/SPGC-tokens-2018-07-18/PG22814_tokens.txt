practical
applications
of
foreword
all
of
us
like
to
think
that
our
actions
and
reactions
are
a
result
of
logical
thought
processes
but
the
fact
is
that
suggestion
influences
our
thinking
a
great
deal
more
than
logic
consciously
or
unconsciously
our
feelings
about
almost
everything
are
largely
molded
by
opinions
and
attitudes
fostered
by
our
mass
methods
of
communication
we
can
not
buy
a
bar
of
soap
or
a
filtered
cigarette
without
paying
tribute
to
the
impact
of
suggestion
right
or
wrong
most
of
us
place
more
confidence
in
what
they
say
than
we
do
in
our
own
powers
of
reason
this
is
the
basic
reason
why
psychiatrists
are
in
short
supply
we
distrust
our
own
mental
processes
and
want
an
expert
to
tell
us
what
to
think
and
feel
despite
this
tendency
to
adopt
our
attitudes
from
others
man
has
always
been
dimly
aware
that
he
can
influence
his
own
destiny
by
directing
his
thoughts
and
actions
into
constructive
channels
he
has
always
to
some
extent
known
that
his
mind
exerts
a
powerful
influence
on
his
body
and
that
thoughts
can
have
harmful
or
helpful
effects
on
his
emotional
and
physical
health
the
ancient
egyptian
sleep
temples
and
the
attempts
by
early
physicians
to
drive
evil
spirits
out
of
the
body
were
both
attempts
to
influence
the
body
through
the
mind
the
unprecedented
sale
of
power
of
positive
by
norman
vincent
peale
and
other
inspirational
literature
proves
that
millions
of
modern
people
recognize
the
efficacy
of
constructive
thoughts
what
most
of
them
do
not
recognize
is
that
they
are
capable
of
implanting
these
beneficial
thoughts
in
their
own
minds
without
reference
to
any
outside
agencies
this
can
be
done
through
in
modern
society
we
have
many
cults
religions
and
methodologies
which
have
mental
discipline
as
their
goal
the
best
example
of
a
methodology
is
psychosomatic
medicine
which
deals
with
the
interrelationship
of
the
mind
and
body
in
the
production
of
mental
or
physical
illness
the
rapid
growth
of
hypnosis
in
the
last
few
years
is
another
example
and
it
is
gratifying
to
see
that
the
emphasis
in
this
field
is
now
shifting
from
to
is
a
highly
suggestible
state
wherein
the
individual
can
direct
suggestions
to
himself
it
is
a
powerful
tool
in
any
therapeutic
process
and
highly
motivated
subjects
can
parallel
the
success
of
through
their
own
efforts
can
be
used
as
a
palliative
agent
and
can
even
afford
lasting
results
in
many
areas
of
the
organism
can
alleviate
distressing
symptoms
substitute
strong
responses
for
weak
responses
help
overcome
bad
habits
create
good
habits
and
help
one
power
of
concentration
the
total
personality
is
eventually
changed
to
the
point
where
it
can
function
adequately
in
an
increasingly
difficult
environment
in
learning
the
subject
does
not
relinquish
control
of
himself
as
is
commonly
believed
actually
more
control
is
gained
and
are
inevitable
results
it
is
well
to
remember
however
that
even
good
things
may
be
overdone
and
good
judgment
is
necessary
for
favorable
results
neither
hypnosis
nor
should
ever
be
used
indiscriminately
the
effectiveness
of
depends
upon
many
factors
strong
motivation
intelligent
application
of
suggestions
and
diligence
are
prerequisites
we
are
not
suggesting
that
can
take
the
place
of
all
forms
of
psychotherapy
we
do
recommend
it
as
an
adjunct
to
therapy
when
indicated
used
judiciously
it
can
contribute
a
great
deal
to
the
individual
physical
and
emotional
and
happiness
as
a
professional
hypnotist
for
many
years
i
have
seen
astounding
and
apparently
miraculous
results
by
individuals
using
many
of
these
cases
seem
unbelievable
to
those
not
familiar
with
hypnotic
phenomena
it
should
be
remembered
though
that
many
individuals
seek
hypnosis
only
when
all
other
forms
of
therapy
have
failed
this
is
so
common
that
hypnosis
has
come
to
be
known
as
a
port
of
last
call
yet
despite
the
seeming
hopelessness
of
such
cases
medical
literature
lists
thousands
of
remarkable
recoveries
there
is
nothing
hit
or
miss
about
hypnosis
used
intelligently
the
results
are
the
same
for
all
those
who
are
properly
motivated
nor
are
the
results
singular
to
modern
hypnotists
alone
in
reviewing
the
literature
going
back
more
than
years
the
same
gratifying
results
were
obtained
the
reader
would
do
well
to
scan
some
books
on
hypnosis
at
the
library
to
understand
the
point
further
this
book
is
written
in
terms
that
are
comprehensible
to
the
layman
the
instructions
should
afford
the
reader
a
means
of
acquiring
the
necessary
material
is
here
the
reader
need
only
follow
the
instructions
as
they
are
given
the
author
wishes
to
thank
robert
starrett

of
the
american
medical

his
valuable

a
more
rewarding

chapter
what
you
should
know
about
hypnosis
has
been
defined
as
a
state
of
heightened
suggestibility
in
which
the
subject
is
able
to
uncritically
accept
ideas
for
and
act
on
them
appropriately
when
a
hypnotist
hypnotizes
his
subject
it
is
known
as
when
an
individual
puts
himself
into
a
state
of
hypnosis
it
is
known
as
in
both
cases
the
subject
has
achieved
a
heightened
state
of
suggestibility
even
in
the
subject
really
controls
the
response
to
suggestions
actually
all
hypnosis
is
really
a
matter
of
the
subject
enters
into
the
hypnotic
state
when
he
is
completely
ready
to
do
so
this
may
require
from
one
to
many
attempts
before
it
is
achieved
even
if
the
subject
insists
that
he
wants
to
be
hypnotized
immediately
he
may
be
resisting
hypnosis
unconsciously
in
the
same
thing
usually
takes
place
the
subject
is
anxious
to
achieve
but
somehow
the
state
eludes
him
what
wrong
it
may
be
that
he
is
unconsciously
resisting
it
conditioned
himself
sufficiently
or
has
achieved
the
hypnotic
state
and
does
know
he
is
in
the
state
this
last
statement
may
be
surprising
but
we
will
examine
it
in
detail
a
little
later
on
most
experts
agree
that
about
percent
of
the
population
can
be
hypnotized
my
own
feeling
is
that
probably
percent
can
be
hypnotized
who
among
us
is
not
influenced
by
suggestion
are
we
all
as
we
have
seen
influenced
by
the
suggestions
of
advertising
do
we
all
have
a
tendency
to
believe
what
we
read
in
the
paper
hear
on
the
radio
or
see
on
television
are
we
all
convinced
that
a
article
is
better
than
one
that
is
not
so
suggestion
plays
a
tremendously
important
role
in
our
daily
lives
it
begins
from
naming
the
baby
with
an
appropriate
name
to
securing
a
suitable
place
for
interment
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
to
a
fascinating
book
dealing
with
the
unconscious
reasons
why
we
do
many
of
the
things
that
we
do
you
will
be
intrigued
with
every
page
of
the
book
it
is
called
hidden
by
vance
packard
my
contention
is
that
we
are
all
suggestible
and
therefore
being
hypnotized
or
hypnotizing
ourselves
is
just
a
matter
of
increasing
the
suggestibility
that
we
already
possess
does
the
hypnotist
begin
by
suggesting
relaxation
does
he
usually
begin
by
requesting
the
subject
to
fix
his
attention
on
a
particular
object
next
he
suggests
to
the
subject
that
his
eyes
are
becoming
heavy
and
tired
as
soon
as
the
subject
closes
his
eyes
he
suggests
that
he
will
be
in
a
deep
hypnotic
state
i
am
sure
that
you
are
familiar
with
this
procedure
with
each
step
the
hypnotist
is
guiding
the
subject
along
directed
lines
to
get
him
to
accept
further
suggestions
without
question
or
doubt
when
the
subject
achieves
the
ultimate
state
in
this
procedure
he
has
been
hypnotized
he
then
accepts
suggestions
without
equivocation
let
us
continue
with
this
same
thought
suppose
i
say
to
you
i
going
to
stick
you
with
this
pin
it
wo
hurt
would
you
let
me
stick
you
with
the
pin
obviously
not
let
us
suppose
that
you
have
been
hypnotized
and
i
repeat
the
same
suggestion
what
happens
then
you
readily
accept
the
suggestion
as
being
factual
should
i
proceed
to
stick
you
with
the
pin
you
do
not
even
flinch
in
fact
you
do
not
even
feel
the
pain
does
this
sound
incredible
is
this
exactly
the
same
procedure
that
the
dentist
uses
with
his
patient
when
he
has
hypnotized
him
for
the
purpose
of
painless
dentistry
achieving
hypnosis
therefore
is
a
matter
of
directing
this
suggestibility
that
we
all
possess
into
the
channels
that
will
finally
produce
the
hypnotic
state
it
can
be
much
more
complicated
than
this
explanation
in
many
cases
but
let
us
use
this
as
a
working
premise
everyone
can
be
hypnotized
the
time
required
for
achieving
hypnosis
will
vary
from
subject
to
subject
we
will
discuss
some
of
the
reasons
for
this
in
a
subsequent
chapter
but
for
our
discussion
at
this
time
we
need
to
understand
this
point
i
have
encountered
numerous
individuals
who
were
extremely
disappointed
because
they
did
not
respond
to
hypnosis
immediately
or
after
several
attempts
they
wanted
to
know
what
was
wrong
an
explanation
that
nothing
was
wrong
somehow
did
not
satisfy
these
individuals
after
all
they
argued
did
i
go
to
a
hypnotist
especially
to
be
hypnotized
some
insinuated
that
perhaps
the
hypnotist
was
too
good
let
me
explain
that
most
subjects
need
to
be
conditioned
for
hypnosis
and
this
conditioning
is
helped
when
the
subject
practices
certain
conditioning
exercises
that
i
shall
discuss
in
detail
in
chapter
six
titled
how
to
attain
in
my
teaching
i
have
found
that
about
one
out
of
ten
subjects
responds
to
the
first
attempt
at
hypnosis
one
can
not
make
a
definite
statement
as
to
the
length
of
time
necessary
to
learn
but
it
is
my
experience
that
this
usually
takes
about
one
month
i
have
had
subjects
learn
in
about
minutes
but
i
must
also
relate
that
i
have
worked
with
subjects
for
one
year
before
they
achieved
it
for
the
most
part
the
laws
of
learning
apply
to
as
with
anything
else
that
one
would
want
to
learn
it
can
be
a
relatively
simple
procedure
or
it
can
be
very
perplexing
the
answer
lies
not
so
much
with
the
hypnotist
as
with
the
subject
one
question
that
arises
is
if
i
under
hypnosis
how
can
i
give
myself
suggestions
during
the
hypnotic
state
it
must
be
remembered
the
subject
is
always
aware
of
what
is
going
on
he
hears
what
is
said
follows
directions
and
terminates
the
state
when
told
to
do
so
in
the
state
the
subject
is
in
full
control
therefore
he
can
think
reason
act
criticize
suggest
or
do
whatever
he
desires
he
can
audibly
give
himself
suggestions
or
he
can
mentally
give
himself
suggestions
in
either
case
he
does
not
rouse
from
the
hypnotic
state
until
he
gives
himself
specific
suggestions
to
do
so
many
feel
if
they
audibly
give
themselves
suggestions
they
will
awaken
in
the
subject
answers
questions
during
the
hypnotic
state
having
the
subject
talk
does
not
terminate
the
state
you
can
keep
the
talkative
subject
under
hypnosis
as
long
as
you
want
furthermore
the
subject
can
be
sitting
erect
with
his
eyes
open
and
still
be
under
hypnosis
carrying
this
further
the
subject
may
not
even
be
aware
that
he
is
under
hypnosis
he
can
be
given
a
cue
not
to
remember
when
the
therapist
makes
a
certain
motion
or
says
a
certain
word
that
he
will
go
back
into
the
hypnotic
state
but
still
keep
his
eyes
open
only
an
experienced
hypnotist
could
detect
the
change
another
frequent
question
is
how
do
i
arouse
myself
from
the
state
you
merely
say
to
yourself
that
upon
counting
to
five
you
will
open
your
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
fine
many
times
the
subject
falls
asleep
while
giving
himself
posthypnotic
suggestions
this
is
not
undesirable
since
the
suggestions
will
spill
over
into
the
subconscious
mind
as
he
goes
from
consciousness
to
unconsciousness
a
popular
opinion
about
hypnosis
is
that
the
subject
surrenders
his
will
to
the
hypnotist
in
the
process
of
being
hypnotized
furthermore
many
believe
that
once
the
subject
is
hypnotized
the
hypnotist
has
complete
control
of
the
subject
and
the
subject
is
powerless
to
resist
suggestion
both
beliefs
are
erroneous
i
believe
the
first
misconception
comes
from
seeing
techniques
where
the
hypnotist
requests
the
subject
to
look
into
his
eyes
the
hypnotist
suggests
to
the
subject
that
as
he
continues
to
look
into
his
eyes
he
will
fall
into
a
deep
hypnotic
state
this
then
becomes
a
matter
of
who
can
outstare
whom
the
subject
usually
begins
to
blink
his
eyes
and
the
hypnotist
follows
this
up
with
rapid
suggestions
that
the
subject
eyes
are
becoming
watery
and
heavy
and
that
the
subject
will
fall
into
a
deep
hypnotic
sleep
just
as
soon
as
he
the
subject
closes
his
eyes
this
procedure
gives
the
impression
to
the
observer
that
the
subject
is
willed
to
go
under
hypnosis
it
appears
that
once
the
hypnotist
concentrates
or
wills
sufficiently
the
subject
succumbs
actually
the
hypnotist
in
this
technique
is
not
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
subject
he
fixes
his
attention
on
the
bridge
of
the
nose
of
the
subject
the
concept
that
the
subject
is
a
helpless
automaton
stems
from
the
weird
movies
where
the
mad
scientist
has
hypnotized
subjects
into
behaving
like
zombies
naturally
there
is
usually
a
beautiful
girl
in
the
movie
and
she
too
has
been
hypnotized
even
though
the
audience
is
sophisticated
enough
to
realize
that
this
drama
is
purely
entertainment
the
theme
is
repeated
sufficiently
in
novels
comics
and
television
to
make
an
indelible
impression
on
the
subconscious
mind
it
the
technique
of
telling
the
big
lie
so
many
times
that
it
becomes
believable
we
are
all
influenced
by
this
procedure
there
is
an
excellent
book
explaining
this
very
premise
it
is
called
for
the
by
william
sargent
it
describes
in
detail
the
technique
by
which
evangelists
psychiatrists
politicians
and
advertising
men
can
change
your
beliefs
and
behavior
following
the
reasoning
that
the
subconscious
mind
can
be
affected
you
can
see
that
a
problem
could
present
itself
even
though
the
subject
consciously
wishes
to
be
hypnotized
unconsciously
there
may
be
a
poor
interrelationship
with
the
hypnotist
which
can
create
an
unfavorable
climate
for
hypnosis
when
this
is
the
case
the
subject
does
respond
until
such
time
that
he
relates
well
to
the
hypnotist
even
the
most
calculated
procedures
will
fail
until
a
positive
transference
relationship
is
established
i
am
sure
that
you
sometimes
have
said
for
some
reason
i
do
like
that
person
if
pressed
for
an
answer
you
usually
reply
i
ca
explain
it
but
i
just
have
a
feeling
about
him
actually
your
subconscious
reactions
are
influencing
your
thinking
and
you
feel
a
certain
way
the
same
thing
takes
place
in
business
transactions
you
either
like
or
dislike
the
proposition
presented
to
you
you
may
say
i
have
a
certain
feeling
about
this
deal
you
may
not
be
conscious
of
the
reasons
but
your
subconscious
has
reacted
automatically
because
of
previous
experience
along
similar
lines
in
giving
you
some
insight
into
the
hypnotic
procedure
i
am
trying
to
point
out
certain
problems
in
regard
to
acquiring
for
the
most
part
it
is
not
a
simple
procedure
that
is
accomplished
immediately
you
ca
just
will
it
it
requires
working
toward
a
specific
goal
and
following
definite
procedures
which
eventually
lead
to
success
the
hypnotist
is
usually
endowed
by
the
subject
with
an
omniscience
and
infallibility
which
logically
is
unjustified
the
subject
is
naturally
extremely
disappointed
if
he
does
respond
immediately
if
he
loses
confidence
in
the
hypnotist
he
may
never
achieve
hypnosis
with
this
particular
hypnotist
i
have
hypnotized
subjects
who
have
been
to
several
other
hypnotists
without
success
and
i
have
had
some
of
my
unsuccessful
subjects
hypnotized
by
other
hypnotists
how
and
why
does
it
happen
i
believe
that
some
of
the
reasons
are
so
intangible
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
all
of
them
with
any
degree
of
exactitude
i
once
saw
an
individual
about
times
who
wanted
to
learn
and
had
been
unsuccessful
in
every
approach
i
asked
him
if
he
would
volunteer
as
a
subject
for
a
class
in
techniques
of
hypnosis
that
i
was
teaching
for
nurses
he
readily
volunteered
and
showed
up
at
the
designated
time
much
to
my
amazement
as
well
as
his
own
he
responded
within
a
relatively
short
time
as
one
of
the
nurses
hypnotized
him
before
the
group
she
had
used
a
standard
eye
closure
technique
requesting
him
to
look
at
a
spinning
hypnodisc
that
i
had
previously
used
with
him
every
time
he
was
in
the
office
her
manner
was
extremely
affable
she
had
used
the
identical
technique
i
had
used
unsuccessfully
and
the
subject
responded
excellently
to
cap
the
climax
he
was
the
first
subject
the
nurse
had
ever
hypnotized
since
this
was
only
her
third
lesson
how
would
you
account
for
it
here
was
one
of
my
students
with
two
weeks
experience
hypnotizing
a
subject
where
i
had
failed
while
using
every
procedure
that
i
felt
would
work
was
it
because
she
was
a
better
hypnotist
perhaps
however
i
like
to
recall
at
this
time
our
discussion
about
subconscious
responses
i
inclined
to
feel
that
being
hypnotized
by
a
female
nurse
created
certain
favorable
unconscious
responses
which
accounted
for
his
going
under
hypnosis
at
that
time
it
created
the
initial
which
was
needed
i
was
able
to
hypnotize
him
easily
at
his
next
appointment
and
he
acquired
readily
from
that
time
on
i
have
tried
the
same
approach
with
other
subjects
who
did
not
respond
favorably
and
have
failed
to
attain
the
success
that
i
did
in
the
above
case
why
the
impasse
it
is
one
of
the
difficulties
that
we
encounter
in
hypnosis
and
as
yet
it
has
not
been
resolved
we
know
that
the
easiest
way
to
achieve
is
to
be
hypnotized
and
given
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
you
will
respond
to
hypnosis
by
a
key
word
phrase
or
gesture
i
have
tried
to
point
out
some
problems
that
can
arise
needless
to
say
these
problems
do
not
always
arise
and
the
attainment
of
can
be
a
relatively
simple
procedure
there
is
usually
some
way
of
reaching
a
subject
who
does
not
respond
in
a
reasonable
length
of
time
now
we
come
to
the
point
where
the
subject
wishes
to
hypnotize
himself
what
happens
in
this
situation
it
would
appear
that
the
subject
would
go
under
hypnosis
immediately
after
all
is
he
controlling
the
hypnotic
session
of
course
this
does
happen
time
and
time
again
and
the
results
seem
miraculous
i
receive
mail
constantly
from
readers
of
several
of
my
other
books
on
hypnosis
telling
me
how
they
were
able
to
achieve
certain
goals
that
they
never
dreamed
possible
they
write
that
they
have
achieved
and
complete
and
have
been
able
to
overcome
problems
that
have
plagued
them
for
many
years
these
problems
not
only
include
strictly
psychological
troubles
but
many
psychosomatic
symptoms
as
well
many
have
remarked
at
the
ease
in
which
they
were
able
to
achieve
and
the
results
they
wanted
for
them
it
was
as
simple
as
following
a
book
others
write
about
the
difficulty
they
encounter
and
ask
what
to
do
about
it
it
is
my
hope
that
this
book
will
shed
some
light
for
those
who
have
experienced
difficulty
in
learning
we
shall
discuss
many
phases
of
hypnosis
with
the
emphasis
on
we
discuss
its
many
ramifications
and
try
not
to
leave
out
anything
helpful
in
our
discussion
if
you
follow
the
instructions
and
exercises
that
i
give
you
assiduously
you
should
be
able
to
achieve
a
depth
of
suitable
for
solving
many
of
your
personal
problems
chapter
what
about
the
dangers
of
hypnosis
one
of
the
objections
that
you
hear
to
hypnosis
is
that
it
can
be
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
those
not
trained
in
the
psychodynamics
of
human
behavior
inasmuch
as
psychiatrists
and
clinical
psychologists
are
the
only
ones
who
are
thoroughly
trained
in
the
analysis
of
human
behavior
this
objection
if
valid
could
limit
hypnosis
to
a
comparative
handful
of
therapists
fortunately
it
is
not
valid
this
was
proved
several
years
ago
when
the
bridey
murphy
craze
gripped
the
country
despite
the
fact
that
thousands
of
amateur
hypnotists
were
practicing
hypnosis
little
or
no
harm
resulted
i
have
personally
instructed
several
thousand
medical
and
individuals
and
have
yet
to
hear
of
a
single
case
where
a
crisis
was
precipitated
or
anything
of
a
dangerous
or
detrimental
nature
occurred
as
a
result
of
hypnosis
i
have
also
taught
several
thousand
persons
and
can
report
the
same
findings
many
patients
who
seek
treatment
from
competent
psychiatrists
psychoanalysts
and
psychologists
do
not
always
obtain
satisfactory
results
this
does
mean
that
everyone
should
stop
seeking
help
from
these
specialists
even
a
specialist
does
have
a
perfect
record
of
successful
therapy
what
then
is
the
objection
to
hypnosis
the
theory
that
if
you
get
rid
of
one
symptom
another
symptom
will
take
its
place
really
holds
no
truth
and
is
usually
advanced
by
those
who
have
had
little
or
no
experience
in
the
hypnosis
field
however
a
difference
of
opinion
does
exist
even
with
those
practicing
hypnosis
in
this
area
some
hypnotists
trade
down
symptoms
by
replacing
a
serious
symptom
with
a
minor
one
while
others
just
remove
the
symptom
the
latter
is
what
a
doctor
does
when
he
recommends
aspirin
for
arthritis
he
knows
the
aspirin
will
not
cure
the
arthritis
but
he
wants
to
alleviate
the
symptom
to
say
that
another
symptom
will
replace
the
pain
is
unscientific
and
untrue
the
same
is
true
of
hypnosis
lewis
wolberg
clinical
professor
of
psychiatry
new
york
medical
college
recently
canvassed
experts
in
the
field
of
hypnosis
and
found
a
few
who
felt
symptom
removal
was
irrational
temporary
or
outright
dangerous
the
large
majority
however
employed
symptom
removal
where
indicated
and
minimized
or
ridiculed
any
possible
bad
effects
a
further
objection
to
hypnosis
is
that
the
results
are
temporary
as
well
as
symptomatic
it
is
well
to
remember
that
most
medical
therapy
is
specifically
directed
to
symptom
removal
how
permanent
is
most
medical
treatment
once
you
couple
with
you
afford
the
patient
the
opportunity
of
utilizing
suggestions
for
his
own
benefit
any
time
they
are
needed
this
of
course
can
make
symptom
relief
permanent
as
an
example
i
would
see
no
harm
in
teaching
a
patient
for
symptomatic
relief
from
a
problem
of
insomnia
it
would
certainly
be
better
than
physically
depressing
the
higher
brain
centers
with
sleeping
pills
to
produce
unconsciousness
every
night
i
need
tell
you
that
millions
of
dollars
are
spent
every
year
on
sleeping
pills
and
patients
become
dependent
upon
them
needing
more
and
more
pills
in
order
to
produce
sleep
many
accidental
suicides
stem
from
an
overdose
of
sleeping
pills
yet
despite
the
inherent
dangers
of
sleeping
pills
which
are
glaringly
apparent
they
are
prescribed
by
the
millions
to
say
nothing
of
those
that
reach
the
market
through
illegal
channels
furthermore
how
much
effort
is
really
made
to
get
the
patient
off
the
sleeping
pills
there
are
also
more
voluntary
suicides
by
sleeping
pills
than
by
any
other
method
perhaps
if
these
drugs
so
readily
available
many
of
these
unfortunate
individuals
would
be
with
us
today
what
about
the
statement
that
you
might
do
some
damage
let
explore
this
area
i
assume
that
the
reader
is
somewhat
familiar
with
the
work
of
emile
coué
or
at
least
has
heard
of
his
famous
autosuggestion
formula
of
day
by
day
in
every
way
i
getting
better
and
better
during
our
time
thousands
upon
thousands
of
seemingly
helpless
and
hopeless
cases
have
been
cured
by
repeating
this
affirmation
over
and
over
again
day
after
day
as
the
individual
falls
asleep
i
think
we
should
make
it
clear
that
whether
we
call
it
autosuggestion
positive
thinking
meditation
yoga
affirmations
or
we
are
in
reality
talking
about
the
same
thing
all
require
certain
basic
prerequisites
before
they
will
work
effectively
for
the
individual
we
discuss
these
prerequisites
in
the
next
chapter
what
should
be
remembered
is
that
the
suggestions
are
being
filtered
into
the
subconscious
mind
which
does
not
question
doubt
analyze
or
dispute
the
efficacy
of
these
beneficial
thoughts
you
can
be
sure
that
the
constant
repetition
will
have
its
effect
has
the
mind
in
the
past
accepted
the
individual
diagnosis
when
he
said
i
sick
i
have
an
inferiority
complex
i
ca
stop
smoking
i
ca
lose
weight
i
ca
concentrate
i
can
remember
a
person
face
but
i
ca
remember
names
i
have
a
difficult
time
falling
asleep
i
just
ca
seem
to
relax
is
such
an
individual
in
effect
using
and
has
the
person
convinced
himself
of
the
validity
of
his
present
state
this
is
truly
dangerous
it
is
negative
hypnosis
the
question
that
i
raise
is
why
should
the
subconscious
mind
be
even
more
convinced
and
respond
strongly
to
suggestions
which
are
in
conformity
with
the
natural
desire
to
be
of
sound
body
and
mind
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
a
logical
answer
i
think
this
is
what
happens
many
times
a
person
seeks
help
with
a
problem
which
in
reality
has
nothing
to
do
with
hypnosis
his
cure
is
not
contingent
on
being
hypnotized
or
on
suggestions
he
or
the
hypnotist
feel
are
indicated
you
will
read
in
nearly
every
book
and
article
dealing
with
hypnosis
that
hypnotism
is
not
a
no
one
has
suggested
or
implied
that
it
should
be
used
exclusively
for
all
emotional
problems
you
may
read
a
newspaper
article
warning
about
the
dangers
of
hypnosis
it
may
tell
of
a
person
who
rid
himself
of
one
symptom
and
developed
another
in
its
place
you
usually
get
a
grossly
distorted
picture
of
what
happened
with
many
aspects
of
the
case
not
included
it
a
matter
of
taking
what
you
want
to
prove
out
of
context
propagandists
use
this
technique
all
the
time
to
get
across
their
message
it
the
old
story
of
telling
a
half
truth
honest
criticism
and
a
sincere
difference
of
opinion
are
always
welcome
but
criticism
must
be
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
and
not
stem
from
an
emotional
reaction
you
have
probably
heard
the
remark
i
wo
let
anyone
hypnotize
me
what
are
they
really
saying
and
what
does
hypnosis
represent
to
such
an
individual
to
them
hypnosis
represents
some
sort
of
magic
spell
which
invokes
a
state
of
complete
helplessness
and
dependency
upon
the
hypnotist
we
previously
discussed
how
this
erroneous
conception
can
take
place
because
of
the
manner
in
which
hypnosis
is
usually
interwoven
with
bizarre
fictional
stories
for
many
the
hypnotic
state
represents
a
period
in
which
the
conscious
guard
is
dropped
they
feel
they
may
compulsively
reveal
the
darker
side
of
their
nature
confess
their
hostility
or
relate
information
they
would
never
voluntarily
divulge
to
anyone
this
is
the
real
danger
they
see
in
hypnosis
to
protect
themselves
from
it
they
attack
it
it
is
much
like
the
fanatic
vice
crusader
who
militantly
attacks
sin
in
order
to
alleviate
his
own
feelings
of
guilt
stemming
from
the
fact
that
vice
actually
attracts
him
fear
of
hypnosis
takes
different
forms
but
basically
it
is
the
fear
of
revealing
one
true
feelings
an
employee
for
instance
at
a
gathering
which
included
the
employer
he
dislikes
would
never
volunteer
as
a
subject
for
hypnosis
if
the
occasion
arose
he
would
be
afraid
he
would
do
or
say
something
which
might
endanger
his
position
hypnosis
for
him
would
be
dangerous
because
he
would
be
afraid
to
take
the
chance
the
truth
is
however
that
this
individual
would
be
taking
no
chance
the
hypnotic
state
is
not
a
confessional
period
the
subject
is
aware
at
all
times
of
what
he
is
saying
if
the
subject
does
not
wish
to
pursue
a
line
of
questioning
he
tells
the
hypnotist
if
the
hypnotist
persisted
further
along
this
line
the
subject
would
shake
off
the
hypnotic
state
another
misconception
about
hypnosis
is
the
widely
held
belief
that
the
subject
is
unconscious
this
represents
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
individual
actually
the
hypnotic
state
is
a
period
of
extreme
awareness
in
which
the
subject
is
hyperacute
furthermore
the
subject
is
not
asleep
nor
is
he
in
a
trance
state
in
the
correct
meaning
of
that
term
he
is
in
an
altered
state
of
awareness
with
his
faculties
and
reasoning
ability
intact
inducing
hypnosis
merely
creates
a
mood
or
state
in
which
the
powers
of
suggestibility
are
heightened
when
the
general
public
and
the
medical
profession
become
familiar
with
the
true
nature
of
hypnosis
we
shall
have
a
greater
acceptance
and
utilization
of
this
power
it
is
a
slow
process
but
one
which
will
finally
evolve
in
the
final
analysis
i
believe
the
only
danger
that
exists
is
in
the
mind
of
the
individual
who
fears
hypnosis
because
of
whatever
subjective
qualms
he
has
about
his
own
emotional
involvement
in
the
hypnotic
process
of
course
all
persons
using
hypnosis
for
the
alleviation
of
pain
should
consult
their
family
physician
pain
is
nature
way
of
indicating
that
something
is
wrong
with
the
organism
it
would
be
foolish
to
suggest
that
a
pain
in
the
stomach
will
disappear
when
this
may
be
a
sign
of
a
needed
appendix
operation
the
same
may
be
said
of
constant
migraine
headaches
it
must
be
determined
that
the
headache
is
not
a
symptom
of
a
brain
tumor
or
some
other
pathological
condition
it
may
be
of
interest
to
know
that
hypnosis
is
presently
being
used
to
relieve
pain
in
terminal
cancer
patients
there
is
an
excellent
article
on
this
subject
and
i
recommend
it
to
doctors
reading
this
book
it
is
called
the
use
of
hypnosis
in
the
case
of
the
cancer
patient
which
appeared
in
the
january
issue
of
at
the
same

would
highly
recommend

medical
use

he
concludes
it
is
the

opinion
based
on

extensive
personal
experience
of
over
years
that
the
use

trained

who
uses

technique
strictly
within

less
than

bull

med
chapter
is
hypnosis
the
answer
george
estabrooks
professor
of
psychology
at
colgate
university
and
author
of
the
book
made
the
following
two
statements
in
a
paper
called
the
future
of
hypnosis
given
as
part
of
a
program
on
the
nature
of
hypnosis
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
american
psychological
association
in
it
would
be
well
to
sound
a
word
of
caution
against
certain
attitudes
which
have
become
prevalent
and
which
can
be
well
illustrated
in
the
field
of
medicine
in
this
respect
direct
suggestion
is
under
the
ban
for
example
a
dictum
remove
the
symptom
unless
the
cause
is
understood
is
much
emphasized
its
validity
is
greatly
open
to
question
since
much
of
medical
practice
is
direct
symptom
removal
as
only
a
little
thought
makes
apparent
another
dictum
generally
followed
is
that
the
unconscious
background
of
must
necessarily
be
made
conscious
to
effect
a
cure
reasonable
and
thoughtful
consideration
of
the
extensive
role
of
the
unconscious
in
daily
living
and
functioning
renders
this
dictum
much
less
creditable
i
should
like
to
discuss
both
of
these
statements
in
some
detail
as
they
invariably
arise
in
the
mind
of
the
individual
seeking
help
through
hypnosis
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
all
the
religious
healings
cited
in
the
bible
involve
direct
symptom
removal
the
cures
that
are
effected
by
religious
devotees
traveling
to
sacred
shrines
are
also
in
the
realm
of
direct
symptom
removal
i
have
yet
to
hear
a
criticism
of
this
type
of
treatment
directed
at
religious
leaders
or
condemnation
of
the
religious
shrines
these
cures
are
accepted
as
evidence
of
the
power
of
faith
or
attributed
to
the
in
these
cases
nothing
is
ever
done
to
make
the
person
cured
understand
the
nature
of
the
unconscious
mechanisms
which
contributed
to
his
problem
religious
healing
can
not
be
dismissed
by
merely
saying
it
scientific
a
methodology
is
only
scientific
when
it
works
it
is
of
no
value
if
it
does
help
the
individual
seeking
help
we
must
face
the
fact
that
not
all
people
can
be
helped
by
the
same
psychological
treatment
we
can
readily
see
this
in
the
following
extreme
example
an
aborigine
suffering
from
a
psychological
problem
certainly
would
be
a
candidate
for
psychoanalysis
as
we
know
it
he
could
no
doubt
be
helped
much
more
readily
by
a
witch
doctor
it
also
stands
to
reason
that
the
sophisticated
westerner
would
not
be
influenced
by
the
incantations
of
a
tribal
medicine
man
going
further
we
find
there
are
many
schools
of
psychotherapy
and
many
approaches
to
solving
man
emotional
problems
the
cure
rate
for
all
of
them
however
is
approximately
the
same
i
think
we
must
accept
the
fact
that
there
is
no
sound
logical
scientific
approach
i
believe
that
so
long
as
the
end
result
is
achieved
the
methodology
was
scientific
for
that
individual
needs
the
goal
of
all
therapies
is
to
help
the
patient
free
himself
from
whatever
emotional
problems
beset
him
this
approach
to
some
readers
may
seem
an
oversimplification
of
a
very
complex
problem
but
i
think
it
time
that
we
had
a
simple
workable
formula
devoid
of
technical
jargon
too
often
complex
technical
terms
and
theories
have
been
glibly
used
to
explain
away
failures
i
believe
we
need
more
and
more
emphasis
on
measures
to
make
the
patient
feel
better
rather
than
spending
most
of
the
time
trying
to
find
out
why
he
does
feel
well
this
of
course
is
symptom
removal
again
i
should
like
to
point
out
an
interesting
fact
pertaining
to
biblical
healers
so
long
as
the
fame
of
the
healer
preceded
his
arrival
in
any
country
he
was
able
to
heal
the
sick
however
where
his
fame
as
a
healer
was
either
unknown
or
discredited
he
found
no
faith
and
subsequently
no
cure
the
earliest
reference
to
hypnosis
is
in
the
bible
genesis
ii
and
the
lord
god
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
and
he
slept
william
malamud
president
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
in
an
address
delivered
at
the
annual
meeting
in
stated
the
following
in
a
paper
called
psychiatric
research
setting
and
motivation
during
the
last
few
years
we
have
witnessed
a
growing
trend
of
overemphasizing
the
value
of
methodology
and
uniformity
of
standards
this
trend
which
could
be
characterized
as
a
of
objectivity
has
already
had
an
important
influence
on
psychiatric
research
it
is
true
that
in
its
emphasis
on
critical
judgment
and
valid
criteria
it
has
helped
to
curb
unrestrained
flights
of
imagination
and
sloppy
methodology
but
the
overglorification
of
objectivity
and
the
insistence
on
rigidly
single
standards
of
acceptable
methods
have
resulted
in
a
concentration
on
certain
phases
of
the
science
of
human
behavior
at
the
expense
of
other
very
important
ones
i
believe
that
most
individuals
have
a
fairly
good
understanding
of
how
they
came
to
have
the
problem
that
they
have
i
have
yet
to
encounter
the
person
who
protests
he
has
no
idea
why
he
does
function
as
he
would
like
to
in
a
certain
area
from
a
practical
standpoint
not
many
have
the
time
nor
money
required
to
delve
into
the
unconscious
background
of
the
problem
the
high
cost
of
treatment
is
a
very
real
objection
and
can
not
be
discounted
lightly
people
suffering
from
emotional
problems
usually
suffer
financial
reverses
as
well
who
is
to
help
these
people
there
are
very
few
places
in
the
country
where
they
can
receive
competent
psychiatric
help
at
a
reasonable
fee
is
there
this
type
of
help
in
your
own
community
it
is
only
when
the
individual
is
destitute
that
the
state
provides
whatever
help
it
can
however
at
this
point
it
a
long
hard
struggle
back
to
good
emotional
health
the
national
association
for
mental
health
and
its
affiliates
issue
about
million
copies
of
different
pamphlets
on
various
aspects
of
mental
health
to
assess
the
value
of
these
pamphlets
mental
hygiene
experts
held
a
conference
at
cornell
university
a
report
on
this
outstanding
conference
has
been
published
it
is
called
mental
health
education
a
critique
a
feature
by
ernest
havemann
in
the
august
issue
of
contains
a
very
worthwhile
article
on
this
conference
called
who
normal
nobody
but
we
all
keep
on
trying
in
dissent
from
health
approach
experts
decry
futile
search
for
an
unreal
goal
the
following
paragraph
is
taken
from
the
article
what
about
psychiatry
and
psychoanalysis
this
is
a
different
matter
many
unhappy
and
people
though
by
no
means
all
who
have
tried
it
have
profited
from
psychotherapy
indeed
all
the
mental
health
pamphlets
as
a
postscript
to
the
methods
they
advocate
wind
up
by
advising
the
reader
to
seek
professional
care
if
his
problems
are
serious
enough
but
the
skeptics
at
cornell
cited
statistics
which
to
them
show
that
psychiatric
treatment
is
as
remote
for
the
average
person
as
a
trip
to
the
moon
aside
from
the
expense
which
most
people
would
find
prohibitive
there
simply
are
not
enough
therapists
to
go
around
the
has
around
psychiatrists
and
clinical
psychologists
in
all
about
one
for
every
citizens
if
everybody
with
emotional
problems
decided
to
see
a
psychiatrist
the
lines
at
the
doctors
offices
would
stretch
for
miles
i
assume
that
most
readers
of
this
book
know
that
state
hospitals
are
understaffed
and
unable
to
provide
proper
care
for
the
mentally
mike
gorman
executive
director
of
the
national
mental
health
committee
has
written
a
crusading
report
on
this
very
theme
called
other
in
this
book
he
tells
us
that
every
other
hospital
bed
in
the
united
states
is
occupied
by
a
mental
case
mental
illness
costs
the
country
two
and
a
half
billion
dollars
a
year
besides
the
more
important
untold
human
suffering
that
can
never
be
equated
in
dollars
the
book
is
a
shocking
story
of
how
we
have
let
this
happen
are
still
letting
it
happen
and
of
how
little
for
the
most
part
we
the
general
public
as
well
as
the
medical
and
psychological
professions
are
doing
to
correct
this
deplorable
situation
it
is
time
that
we
the
dictums
that
say
a
symptom
can
never
be
removed
unless
the
cause
is
understood
and
the
unconscious
background
of
must
be
made
conscious
and
understood
before
a
cure
is
effected
there
are
many
positive
thinking
groups
functioning
in
the
religious
field
many
of
these
religious
groups
are
in
existence
primarily
because
of
the
dynamic
philosophy
or
psychology
they
offer
for
every
day
living
couple
this
with
a
strong
faith
in
god
and
you
have
a
combination
which
approaches
infallibility
recently
we
have
had
a
series
of
books
which
expound
this
very
theme
does
it
work
of
course
it
does
when
used
properly
you
can
be
sure
that
there
has
been
criticism
of
this
religious
psychology
the
criticism
is
that
the
basic
causes
of
the
problem
are
never
dealt
with
and
the
unconscious
conflict
is
not
resolved
it
the
same
argument
over
and
over
again
what
about
the
people
helped
they
seem
to
have
made
tremendous
strides
and
are
leading
lives
as
well
adjusted
as
anyone
else
once
imbued
with
this
spirit
or
feeling
of
it
permeates
every
phase
of
their
relationships
in
a
constructive
manner
the
only
reason
that
there
is
more
criticism
is
that
this
type
of
psychotherapy
is
incorporated
into
the
religious
tenets
of
these
groups
and
criticizing
another
man
religion
makes
the
detractor
entire
philosophy
unacceptable
i
am
strongly
in
favor
of
these
groups
because
i
would
prefer
having
a
religion
that
keeps
pointing
out
the
positive
side
of
life
and
that
life
can
be
beautiful
if
you
put
your
faith
in
god
and
practice
positive
thinking
it
is
certainly
better
than
the
cynical
philosophy
of
its
detractors
or
the
grim
religions
which
stress
punishment
think
of
the
guilt
feelings
involved
in
the
latter
no
one
can
live
up
to
such
a
formidable
creed
of
course
if
you
suggest
to
positive
thinking
religious
individuals
that
they
are
using
a
form
of
they
will
emphatically
deny
and
debate
the
issue
since
we
are
primarily
interested
in
mental
hygiene
and
not
in
winning
a
debate
it
is
well
to
leave
the
matter
as
it
stands
the
point
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
so
long
as
a
person
feels
that
this
methodology
is
the
answer
to
his
needs
and
so
long
as
no
one
is
being
hurt
by
his
belief
i
feel
he
should
cling
to
his
conviction
he
should
not
allow
it
to
be
destroyed
by
those
who
are
thinking
in
different
semantic
terms
i
would
like
to
bring
up
another
common
example
pertaining
to
the
two
basic
concepts
that
we
have
been
discussing
it
is
the
example
of
the
many
individuals
who
have
taken
public
speaking
courses
to
overcome
stage
fright
in
most
cases
the
person
involved
has
had
too
much
opportunity
to
be
a
public
speaker
because
of
this
he
suddenly
feels
he
may
not
say
the
right
thing
or
forget
what
he
wants
to
say
this
anxiety
can
create
the
very
situation
or
block
that
he
fears
what
is
the
solution
certainly
not
psychoanalysis
to
find
out
why
he
functions
the
way
he
does
you
could
use
this
approach
but
i
do
think
it
the
most
constructive
one
it
is
like
asking
what
am
i
doing
wrong
instead
of
what
can
i
do
that
right
the
most
constructive
approach
is
to
take
a
course
of
instruction
to
get
the
actual
practice
and
experience
in
the
techniques
of
public
speaking
before
proceeding
further
i
believe
it
is
necessary
to
point
out
that
i
am
not
just
being
critical
of
the
convictions
of
other
sincere
and
dedicated
individuals
engaged
in
the
field
of
mental
hygiene
it
is
always
good
to
our
present
thinking
on
any
subject
no
matter
how
sincere
or
convinced
we
may
be
that
what
we
are
doing
is
correct
at
times
we
can
become
so
immersed
in
our
convictions
that
we
can
not
take
criticism
and
respond
emotionally
to
ideas
or
interpretations
that
do
not
coincide
with
logical
thinking
what
then
is
the
answer
to
mental
health
problems
there
is
no
single
answer
it
is
a
very
complex
situation
there
are
many
promising
drugs
and
treatments
which
if
adequately
developed
and
widely
used
could
do
a
great
deal
toward
promoting
good
mental
health
fundamentally
the
problem
will
always
be
that
of
trying
to
understand
human
behavior
and
helping
those
in
distress
with
an
efficacious
formula
what
is
that
formula
i
believe
hypnosis
can
contribute
in
part
to
the
answer
needless
to
say
hypnosis
is
contraindicated
in
many
emotional
problems
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
itself
some
emotional
difficulties
must
first
be
worked
out
on
a
conscious
level
after
this
hypnosis
can
be
instrumental
in
achieving
the
final
goal
frank
caprio
a
prominent
psychiatrist
in
his
book
yourself
with
states
the
following
a
whole
new
world
of
and
positive
living
is
open
to
every
person
young
and
old
through
hypnosis
and
or
chapter
how
does
work
there
an
old
chinese
proverb
that
states
one
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words
in
conveying
suggestions
to
the
subconscious
we
have
found
that
picture
images
are
more
effective
than
the
words
that
are
implanted
for
example
it
is
sufficient
to
say
i
will
be
confident
the
words
must
be
augmented
by
a
picture
of
yourself
as
the
confident
person
you
want
to
be
if
you
say
i
ca
visualize
myself
as
a
confident
person
because
i
have
never
been
that
way
you
can
borrow
those
personality
traits
that
you
want
for
yourself
imagine
yourself
endowed
with
the
characteristics
of
some
confident
person
that
you
know
the
qualities
that
you
seek
may
even
be
borrowed
from
a
famous
person
if
this
is
possible
make
up
a
personality
which
is
a
composite
of
all
the
things
you
want
to
be
see
yourself
walking
talking
and
carrying
on
activities
keep
fortifying
this
image
with
the
mental
suggestions
that
are
needed
it
wo
be
long
before
these
mental
impressions
give
rise
to
the
confident
feelings
that
you
seek
as
you
keep
implanting
these
images
they
will
become
a
natural
part
of
your
conscious
personality
j
van
pelt
president
of
the
british
society
of
medical
hypnotists
and
editor
of
the
journal
of
medical
writes
about
this
technique
in
his
book
of
he
calls
it
technique
in
medical
hypnotherapy
as
you
read
the
following
paragraph
it
would
be
well
to
remember
that
it
contains
the
essence
of
making
the
technique
work
once
you
have
achieved
the
hypnotic
state
per
se
incidentally
the
same
procedure
can
be
used
in
attaining
the
hypnotic
state
itself
you
see
yourself
entering
the
state
of
hypnosis
in
your
initial
attempts
this
in
turn
sets
up
a
conditioned
response
and
a
favorable
emotional
reaction
which
is
necessary
the
writer
has
found
visualization
of
the
greatest
value
in
the
of
the
patient
which
is
an
essential
part
of
hypnotherapy
in
this
method
after
the
cause
of
the
trouble
has
been
discovered
and
as
a
part
of
his
the
patient
is
instructed
while
under
only
light
hypnosis
to
a
picture
in
his
mind
he
is
asked
to
imagine
a
movie
screen
and
to
see
himself
like
an
actor
on
this
screen
playing
a
part
he
is
told
that
the
picture
looks
real
in
fact
and
that
he
can
see
himself
acting
and
looking
the
way
he
really
wants
to
look
and
act
various
scenes
are
suggested
such
as
the
patient
will
have
to
face
in
real
life
in
each
he
is
instructed
to
see
himself
in
real
life
always
succeeding
for
instance
the
stammerer
might
be
asked
to
picture
himself
speaking
easily
to
people
and
feeling
perfectly
at
ease
the
patient
is
also
instructed
how
to
form
these
pictures
for
himself
and
it
is
stressed
that
he
will
only
be
able
to
see
himself
as
he
wants
to
be
successful
since
the
pictures
give
rise
to
the
appropriate
feelings
it
is
not
long
before
the
patient
begins
to
show
the
benefit
of
his
private
film
shows
after
explaining
this
technique
to
students
many
have
inquired
is
that
all
there
is
to
it
it
seems
so
simple
of
course
there
is
more
to
it
in
that
the
individual
must
follow
through
with
the
instruction
this
is
one
of
the
difficult
aspects
of
this
type
of
program
let
me
enumerate
some
of
the
problems
i
have
encountered
in
teaching
as
mentioned
one
of
the
difficulties
is
that
the
technique
seems
too
simple
students
become
skeptical
they
feel
it
should
be
more
complicated
and
involved
in
order
to
get
results
i
suppose
people
better
appreciate
something
that
comes
only
after
a
hard
struggle
this
procedure
is
devoid
of
this
of
course
i
am
not
saying
that
once
a
person
begins
to
use
this
technique
his
problems
will
automatically
vanish
and
his
life
will
be
cheery
forever
after
we
have
been
conditioned
to
think
that
success
in
anything
can
only
come
after
a
long
hard
struggle
this
is
the
basic
theme
of
the
american
way
of
life
we
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
that
conflict
and
struggle
are
part
of
life
and
large
doses
of
it
are
necessary
before
we
achieve
success
in
any
field
i
can
only
reiterate
that
the
information
contained
in
this
book
is
all
you
need
to
get
results
it
is
necessary
that
you
follow
through
and
not
give
up
after
you
have
tried
the
program
for
a
short
while
and
have
obtained
no
appreciable
results
this
brings
us
to
another
point
many
persons
expect
immediate
results
when
they
begin
to
use
if
they
do
get
the
results
they
anticipated
immediately
they
want
to
know
what
wrong
my
answer
is
usually
that
nothing
is
wrong
and
that
they
need
only
keep
steadily
applying
the
instructions
certainly
one
does
become
a
proficient
typist
musician
actor
or
sportsman
because
he
has
mastered
the
basic
techniques
it
takes
time
to
acquire
proficiency
let
me
assure
you
that
anyone
using
and
applying
this
technique
can
benefit
from
it
one
of
the
troubles
in
dealing
with
any
problem
is
routing
defeatism
and
hopelessness
you
can
incorporate
posthypnotic
corrective
measures
in
the
suggestions
that
you
give
yourself
however
i
believe
that
they
must
be
dealt
with
on
a
conscious
level
as
well
you
must
believe
that
you
can
conquer
your
difficulties
no
matter
how
long
you
have
had
them
if
you
are
prepared
to
work
with
in
an
unremitting
manner
you
will
achieve
the
that
you
seek
now
and
then
you
can
anticipate
a
setback
in
your
progress
but
this
need
discourage
you
from
your
overall
task
recount
the
progress
already
made
if
you
have
a
because
you
expected
quicker
and
more
dramatic
results
remember
that
this
is
a
common
feeling
shared
by
many
with
emotional
problems
remember
also
how
long
you
have
had
the
problem
no
doubt
you
have
tried
other
methods
and
became
discouraged
because
you
were
making
the
progress
you
had
anticipated
you
dropped
the
idea
and
landed
back
where
you
started
make
up
your
mind
consciously
that
you
will
work
with
untiring
sincerity
and
a
perseverance
that
will
not
falter
because
your
chosen
goal
is
not
achieved
immediately
i
know
of
no
therapy
that
leads
straight
to
positive
results
without
obstacles
and
intermittent
failure
success
comes
in
spite
of
intervening
failures
because
the
ultimate
direction
has
been
clearly
thought
out
and
charted
will
finally
work
because
you
are
constantly
conditioning
your
subconscious
to
react
in
a
positive
constructive
manner
the
program
must
of
necessity
become
automatic
in
nature
when
it
does
you
will
suddenly
find
yourself
feeling
the
way
you
wanted
to
and
doing
the
things
that
you
set
out
to
do
with
the
aid
of
you
actually
cultivate
those
feelings
that
you
want
hypnosis
will
not
work
with
skeptics
every
so
often
such
a
person
comes
to
my
office
seeking
help
he
tells
me
that
his
family
physician
or
his
spouse
feels
he
should
take
my
course
in
i
inquire
if
he
feels
he
might
benefit
from
the
course
if
his
answer
is
not
positive
and
if
after
talking
to
him
at
length
about
the
benefits
of
hypnosis
i
still
feel
he
is
not
ready
for
the
course
i
suggest
another
mode
of
treatment
for
him
the
reason
for
this
is
that
unless
the
person
is
optimistic
and
enthusiastic
about
it
just
is
going
to
work
as
effectively
as
it
would
otherwise
the
very
nature
of
a
skeptical
attitude
limits
the
constructive
forces
that
we
wish
to
harness
occasionally
individuals
want
indisputable
proof
that
hypnosis
is
going
to
help
them
it
is
impossible
to
give
them
the
proof
and
unqualified
reassurance
that
they
seek
yet
these
same
people
do
not
require
proof
from
their
physicians
no
one
can
guarantee
success
however
i
do
point
out
that
the
continued
and
intelligent
use
of
can
be
instrumental
in
directing
the
healing
curative
constructive
forces
of
nature
many
times
a
metaphysical
rather
than
a
scientific
approach
is
required
it
a
matter
of
trying
to
satisfy
the
patient
needs
at
times
it
is
helpful
to
allow
the
patient
to
attend
a
class
in
being
able
to
communicate
and
identify
with
other
individuals
seeking
often
is
enough
to
change
his
attitude
this
is
especially
true
when
one
or
more
of
the
students
relates
dramatic
changes
works
because
we
are
able
to
condition
ourselves
to
various
stimuli
we
condition
ourselves
consciously
and
unconsciously
to
many
activities
when
we
experience
anxiety
it
stems
from
a
conditioning
process
which
could
have
been
conscious
or
unconscious
in
the
individual
consciously
works
toward
implementing
and
strengthening
his
own
inherent
strength
and
resources
these
objectives
when
attained
result
in
feelings
of
confidence
relaxation
and
furthermore
hypnosis
utilizes
a
natural
mental
process
we
all
know
that
placebos
work
admirably
in
numerous
cases
the
dictionary
defines
the
word
placebo
as
an
inactive
substance
or
preparation
administered
to
please
or
gratify
a
patient
also
used
in
controlled
studies
to
determine
the
efficiency
of
medicinal
substances
many
controlled
experiments
have
shown
that
people
achieve
similar
results
whether
they
take
a
placebo
which
they
think
is
the
real
medication
or
real
medication
that
was
prescribed
several
years
ago
many
such
tests
were
carried
out
with
antihistamines
to
prevent
colds
the
results
were
always
the
same
we
are
interested
in
what
makes
the
placebo
act
as
effectively
as
the
true
medication
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
chain
reaction
is
set
up
actually
causing
a
physiological
result
from
a
psychological
reaction
the
unsuspecting
patient
declares
i
never
felt
so
good
in
my
life
yet
this
would
never
have
happened
if
he
did
think
he
was
taking
the
marvelous
new
medicine
a
recent
scientific
study
by
one
of
the
leading
pharmaceutical
houses
concluded
that
one
third
of
the
effectiveness
of
any
medication
depends
upon
the
faith
and
trust
that
the
patient
has
in
the
prescribing
physician
i
am
sure
that
the
placebo
results
and
the
patient
faith
in
the
physician
as
contributing
factors
to
the
effectiveness
of
medications
do
not
come
as
a
revelation
we
are
all
aware
of
such
information
our
problem
is
how
to
harness
this
unconscious
process
for
constructive
goals
the
answer
is
through
as
we
have
explained
it
uses
a
technique
called
this
has
been
referred
to
by
many
different
names
but
for
our
purposes
we
call
it
within
this
technique
lies
one
of
the
keys
for
achieving
the
goals
that
you
want
there
have
been
many
famous
books
written
incorporating
this
technique
as
a
basis
for
achievement
perhaps
the
most
famous
of
all
is
called
and
grow
by
napoleon
hill
in
recent
years
magic
of
by
claude
bristol
and
power
of
positive
already
mentioned
have
become
the
book
which
gives
direction
to
most
of
the
books
in
this
field
is
called
through
conscious
by
emile
coué
i
am
sure
the
older
readers
of
this
book
have
heard
of
his
famous
saying
which
i
will
repeat
here
for
emphasis
day
by
day
in
every
way
i
am
getting
better
and
better
invariably
in
all
these
books
there
is
reference
to
the
biblical
quotation
as
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
as
the
reader
can
deduce
we
are
not
theorizing
about
a
startling
new
discovery
the
technique
is
as
ancient
as
man
himself
and
his
dream
of
a
better
tomorrow
all
books
using
the
technique
tell
you
to
paint
a
vivid
mental
picture
of
the
material
things
you
wish
to
acquire
if
it
is
a
case
of
material
wealth
for
personal
improvement
they
tell
you
to
paint
a
vivid
picture
of
the
individual
you
want
to
be
in
most
cases
you
are
told
to
do
this
in
a
relaxed
or
meditative
state
with
as
few
distractions
as
possible
the
next
two
requirements
are
constant
repetition
conditioning
and
a
burning
desire
motivation
to
achieve
what
you
set
out
to
do
are
these
books
really
talking
about
are
they
describing
precisely
the
techniques
of
the
terminology
is
different
but
the
approach
is
the
same
with
these
techniques
there
is
an
aim
to
direct
thinking
picturization
positive
thinking
suggestions
and
constructive
thoughts
or
images
to
the
inner
self
or
real
self
are
they
once
again
really
talking
about
the
subconscious
mind
i
have
no
argument
with
any
workable
approach
to
emotional
maturity
but
in
many
cases
we
are
actually
becoming
involved
with
the
meaning
of
words
semantics
the
quickest
way
to
the
subconscious
is
through
in
this
state
you
are
able
to
consciously
direct
suggestions
to
your
subconscious
mind
chapter
how
to
arouse
yourself
from
the
state
you
will
note
that
this
chapter
precedes
instruction
on
how
to
attain
the
reason
for
this
is
to
alleviate
whatever
anxiety
you
may
have
in
regard
to
the
question
if
i
hypnotized
how
do
i
awaken
myself
it
is
important
to
understand
that
even
though
you
are
hypnotized
you
are
in
control
are
aware
of
your
surroundings
what
is
going
on
about
you
can
think
clearly
and
can
arouse
yourself
very
easily
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
or
think
i
shall
now
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
fine
you
could
also
give
yourself
a
specific
count
and
say
as
i
count
to
five
i
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
wonderfully
well
and
refreshed
one
two
three
four
five
it
should
be
remembered
that
while
we
sometimes
use
the
word
sleep
to
describe
the
hypnotic
state
we
are
not
actually
referring
to
true
sleep
this
accounts
for
much
of
the
confusion
the
individual
thinks
if
i
asleep
how
can
i
awaken
myself
if
the
subject
were
asleep
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
this
would
be
impossible
actually
the
subject
is
in
a
special
or
heightened
state
of
awareness
in
he
is
extremely
conscious
although
his
general
physical
appearance
is
one
of
passiveness
in
the
state
the
individual
consciously
gives
himself
whatever
suggestions
he
desires
this
proves
he
conscious
and
therefore
can
awaken
himself
with
the
appropriate
suggestions
occasionally
the
subject
falls
asleep
while
giving
himself
suggestions
or
while
relaxing
to
get
into
the
right
psychological
mood
naturally
in
this
case
the
subject
will
awaken
in
due
course
if
the
subject
practices
hypnosis
when
he
is
normally
set
to
fall
asleep
in
bed
he
would
awaken
refreshed
in
the
morning
at
his
usual
time
before
beginning
to
give
yourself
therapeutic
suggestions
you
could
give
yourself
the
following
suggestions
which
give
you
a
length
of
that
you
will
work
with
i
shall
work
with
for
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
wonderfully
well
wide
awake
confident
cheerful
and
optimistic
the
moment
i
open
my
eyes
i
feel
refreshed
in
case
of
any
outside
danger
i
be
able
to
awaken
immediately
be
fully
alert
and
act
accordingly
you
will
notice
that
these
suggestions
take
into
consideration
the
possibility
of
something
happening
of
danger
to
the
individual
such
as
fire
etc
these
points
arise
in
the
minds
of
most
individuals
attempting
and
are
well
taken
you
could
also
set
an
alarm
clock
to
awaken
you
at
a
designated
time
let
us
assume
to
arouse
yourself
you
gave
yourself
a
suggestion
to
open
your
eyes
and
be
wide
awake
at
the
count
of
five
you
count
to
five
and
for
some
reason
you
are
unable
to
open
your
eyes
first
of
all
worry
remain
relaxed
and
give
yourself
the
suggestions
over
again
emphasizing
to
yourself
that
at
the
count
of
five
you
will
absolutely
positively
be
able
to
open
your
eyes
very
easily
and
will
feel
fine
you
then
begin
the
count
again
reiterating
between
each
number
that
you
will
positively
open
your
eyes
at
the
count
of
five
and
be
wide
awake
this
should
do
it
should
this
not
do
it
may
i
reassure
you
again
become
alarmed
relax
for
a
few
minutes
and
try
again
you
be
able
to
open
your
eyes
and
wake
up
i
hope
i
have
frightened
you
with
the
prospect
of
not
being
able
to
awaken
i
bring
this
up
only
to
acquaint
you
with
the
procedure
to
use
actually
the
problem
of
dehypnotization
is
a
rare
one
i
should
point
out
a
very
important
fact
have
never
had
a
subject
practicing
or
using
tell
me
he
had
the
least
bit
of
difficulty
in
awakening
himself
from
the
hypnotic
i
have
had
persons
tell
me
that
they
heard
or
read
of
a
case
where
the
hypnotist
could
not
bring
the
subject
out
of
the
hypnotic
state
and
as
a
result
the
subject
slept
for
so
many
days
not
one
of
the
stories
could
be
documented
years
ago
for
publicity
purposes
stage
hypnotists
would
have
a
subject
sleep
in
a
store
window
for
several
days
this
was
on
a
voluntary
basis
though
and
should
not
be
confused
with
what
we
are
discussing
in
working
with
subjects
i
have
had
a
subject
who
did
not
awaken
at
a
specific
count
but
i
have
had
this
experience
i
have
usually
found
that
the
subject
is
so
relaxed
that
he
just
did
want
to
awaken
for
fear
of
losing
this
pleasant
sensation
when
the
subject
does
awaken
i
merely
ask
him
in
a
calm
manner
why
do
you
wish
to
wake
up
you
can
answer
me
without
awakening
from
the
hypnotic
state
he
usually
replies
he
like
to
remain
in
this
state
for
another
five
minutes
or
so
i
agree
to
this
extended
period
while
getting
a
firm
commitment
from
him
that
he
will
awaken
after
this
period
this
is
usually
sufficient
to
bring
the
subject
out
of
the
hypnotic
state
occasionally
the
instructions
to
wake
up
are
not
clear
to
the
subject
if
this
is
the
case
clearer
instructions
should
be
given
you
could
also
deepen
the
hypnotic
state
and
then
give
suggestions
to
awaken
at
a
specific
count
in
a
very
authoritarian
manner
every
so
often
i
have
found
that
the
subject
has
fallen
into
a
natural
sleep
and
just
heard
the
instructions
in
this
case
i
raise
my
voice
which
is
usually
sufficient
or
gently
shake
the
subject
awakening
him
as
you
would
any
sleeping
person
i
would
like
to
relate
a
rather
interesting
experience
that
i
had
with
a
male
subject
i
had
worked
with
this
particular
subject
six
times
previous
to
this
occasion
he
was
a
good
hypnotic
subject
and
he
failed
to
awaken
in
the
usual
manner
since
he
had
carried
out
several
posthypnotic
suggestions
it
was
rather
perplexing
to
analyze
what
had
happened
after
about
ten
minutes
he
finally
agreed
while
he
was
under
hypnosis
to
awaken
at
a
given
count
i
asked
him
what
was
the
nature
of
the
difficulty
he
replied
i
wanted
to
see
how
you
would
react
in
conclusion
having
difficulty
in
dehypnotizing
yourself
is
extremely
rare
should
it
happen
and
repeat
the
suggestions
with
emphasis
even
in
where
the
hypnotist
hypnotizes
a
subject
it
is
extremely
rare
there
are
explainable
psychodynamic
factors
for
this
however
they
can
be
met
adequately
while
the
subject
is
under
hypnosis
chapter
how
to
attain
let
us
begin
with
the
hypothesis
that
anyone
can
learn
and
practice
to
some
degree
the
science
of
we
shall
assume
that
you
have
carefully
thought
out
what
you
want
to
accomplish
you
have
through
come
up
with
reasonable
goals
of
therapy
and
the
next
step
is
the
acquisition
of
the
hypnotic
state
per
se
before
giving
you
the
specific
instructions
i
would
like
to
clarify
a
question
which
invariably
arises
in
teaching
a
student
it
is
are
the
suggestions
that
i
give
myself
as
effective
as
the
ones
you
would
give
me
in
it
is
natural
to
assume
that
the
suggestions
of
the
hypnotist
would
be
more
effective
than
those
given
by
the
subject
himself
but
both
have
the
same
intrinsic
value
it
is
well
to
remember
that
all
hypnosis
is
really
and
all
are
transposed
into
if
the
hypnotist
firmly
suggests
from
this
moment
you
will
feel
very
confident
in
all
life
situations
the
subject
automatically
and
unconsciously
rephrases
the
statement
from
this
moment
i
will
feel
very
confident
in
all
life
situations
the
subject
ordinarily
mentally
or
aloud
repeats
all
suggestions
using
the
pronoun
i
instead
of
you
the
easiest
and
quickest
way
to
learn
is
to
be
hypnotized
and
given
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
to
the
effect
that
you
will
be
able
to
put
yourself
into
the
hypnotic
state
at
a
given
stimulus
whenever
you
desire
to
do
so
the
hypnotist
need
not
be
a
professional
anyone
understanding
the
rudiments
of
hypnosis
can
do
this
however
let
us
assume
you
want
to
learn
and
can
not
find
help
if
you
understand
and
consciously
practice
the
instructions
that
i
shall
outline
you
will
attain
your
goal
sit
in
an
easy
chair
or
recline
on
a
sofa
or
bed
next
choose
a
point
of
eye
fixation
on
the
ceiling
preferably
a
spot
behind
you
which
would
normally
cause
eye
fatigue
or
strain
now
breathe
very
slowly
and
deeply
as
you
do
this
repeat
aloud
or
mentally
the
word
sleep
as
you
inhale
and
deep
sleep
as
you
exhale
do
this
for
several
minutes
in
a
very
monotonous
manner
until
such
time
as
you
find
yourself
getting
drowsy
next
suggest
to
yourself
that
your
eyelids
are
becoming
heavy
and
tired
the
goal
is
to
acquire
eye
closure
using
this
method
you
want
to
reach
a
state
where
it
is
uncomfortable
to
keep
the
eyes
open
once
you
get
your
eyes
closing
seemingly
of
their
own
volition
you
have
reached
the
first
step
in
achieving
you
can
repeat
to
yourself
such
suggestions
as
my
eyelids
are
becoming
very
heavy
and
tired
my
eyes
are
becoming
very
watery
my
eyelids
are
blinking
i
just
want
to
close
my
eyes
the
moment
i
close
my
eyelids
i
shall
fall
into
a
deep
sound
hypnotic
sleep
even
though
in
a
deep
state
of
hypnosis
i
shall
be
aware
of
my
surroundings
and
be
able
to
direct
posthypnotic
suggestions
to
my
subconscious
mind
when
your
eyelids
actually
become
heavy
or
when
your
eyes
actually
begin
to
water
you
intensify
these
feelings
by
repeating
affirmative
suggestions
along
these
very
lines
this
is
known
as
the
technique
and
helps
to
reinforce
the
actual
condition
that
exists
proceeding
in
this
way
hastens
the
actual
closing
of
the
eyes
and
attainment
of
the
hypnotic
state
per
se
let
us
assume
that
you
practice
this
procedure
and
seemingly
nothing
happens
continue
to
practice
it
again
and
again
until
such
time
as
you
are
able
to
achieve
an
eye
closure
you
will
eventually
be
able
to
do
this
within
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
one
of
the
best
times
to
practice
the
technique
just
given
is
when
you
are
falling
asleep
at
night
the
lights
are
out
and
you
are
lying
in
bed
choose
an
imaginary
spot
above
and
behind
your
eye
level
so
there
is
some
strain
on
the
eye
muscles
now
begin
giving
yourself
suggestions
that
your
eyelids
are
becoming
heavy
etc
the
reason
this
period
is
such
an
excellent
time
to
practice
is
that
the
suggestions
you
give
yourself
spill
over
into
your
subconscious
as
you
drift
from
consciousness
to
unconsciousness
it
like
telling
yourself
to
wake
up
at
a
certain
time
in
the
morning
the
suggestion
reaches
your
subconscious
and
activates
you
consciously
to
waken
using
this
approach
you
can
give
yourself
dynamic
constructive
suggestions
at
this
time
as
well
as
giving
yourself
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
the
next
time
you
practice
you
will
fall
into
a
deeper
sound
hypnotic
state
at
the
count
of
three
you
also
emphasize
that
your
eyelids
will
close
involuntarily
whenever
you
relax
for
five
minutes
and
afterwards
count
to
three
this
conditioning
process
will
be
augmented
by
the
use
of
the
sleep
period
the
suggestions
will
tend
to
work
unconsciously
during
this
period
and
hasten
your
attainment
of
the
constructive
goals
as
well
as
the
goal
itself
once
you
have
achieved
eye
closure
deepen
the
hypnotic
state
by
the
following
suggestions
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
go
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
profound
hypnotic
state
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
find
myself
becoming
more
and
more
relaxed
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
fall
into
a
deep
hypnotic
sleep
you
repeat
these
suggestions
many
times
actually
trying
on
a
conscious
level
to
feel
sleepier
more
relaxed
more
at
ease
in
doing
this
you
take
on
the
characteristics
of
a
deeply
hypnotized
subject
part
of
the
difficulty
in
learning
is
that
the
subject
is
aiming
at
a
state
of
mind
in
which
he
has
no
experience
if
i
say
act
happy
or
act
sad
there
is
an
immediate
reaction
from
your
experiential
background
and
you
can
react
accordingly
if
you
have
never
seen
anyone
hypnotized
and
i
say
act
as
though
you
were
hypnotized
you
must
of
necessity
act
in
a
manner
that
you
would
assume
approximated
that
of
hypnosis
if
you
had
actually
seen
someone
hypnotized
you
would
naturally
take
on
the
characteristics
you
had
observed
this
would
either
be
done
consciously
or
unconsciously
some
individuals
describe
the
hypnotic
state
as
a
state
of
complete
relaxation
many
get
a
feeling
of
detachment
others
a
feeling
of
disassociation
as
though
their
entire
being
was
only
thought
some
get
a
floating
or
drifting
feeling
likening
the
experience
to
lying
on
deep
clouds
others
experience
a
heavy
pleasant
sinking
feeling
still
others
get
a
feeling
of
peace
and
serenity
many
describe
the
hypnotic
state
as
being
akin
to
the
state
just
prior
to
falling
asleep
or
like
daydreaming
and
they
experience
the
same
reactions
yet
there
are
some
who
do
not
feel
a
definite
change
they
describe
it
by
saying
i
just
felt
that
i
had
my
eyes
closed
i
heard
everything
and
was
completely
aware
at
all
times
since
it
is
possible
to
direct
your
feelings
reactions
i
would
suggest
that
you
aim
for
a
completely
relaxed
comfortable
state
you
have
now
reached
the
point
where
your
eyes
are
closed
and
you
have
given
yourself
further
suggestions
to
deepen
the
state
of
hypnosis
this
has
taken
from
about
six
to
ten
minutes
you
are
not
sure
though
that
you
are
under
hypnosis
there
are
many
ways
to
test
this
and
i
shall
outline
one
of
these
tests
later
in
this
chapter
however
for
your
initial
attempts
it
is
too
important
whether
or
not
you
are
under
hypnosis
you
are
still
to
give
yourself
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
the
next
time
you
attempt
to
hypnotize
yourself
you
will
fall
into
a
deeper
and
sounder
state
after
you
have
relaxed
for
about
five
minutes
and
counted
to
three
in
your
initial
attempts
you
will
be
trying
to
establish
a
conditioned
response
to
the
count
of
three
which
will
subsequently
cause
your
eyes
to
close
and
put
you
under
hypnosis
eventually
you
should
react
instantly
to
the
count
of
three
or
any
other
cue
you
may
use
to
trigger
the
response
the
key
words
or
stimulus
become
associated
with
the
action
that
you
seek
through
repetition
just
thinking
about
the
stimulus
can
bring
on
the
response
this
is
known
as
ideomotor
action
and
is
present
in
the
waking
as
well
as
the
hypnotic
state
famous
experiments
which
induced
dogs
to
salivate
when
a
bell
was
rung
after
previously
having
had
food
fed
to
them
at
the
same
time
are
examples
of
this
type
of
conditioning
do
we
generally
become
hungry
if
someone
tells
us
it
noon
and
time
for
lunch
when
in
fact
only
i
had
a
common
experience
recently
that
i
am
sure
many
readers
have
shared
one
of
my
neighbors
seeing
my
car
was
parked
in
front
of
my
house
and
knowing
i
was
home
called
to
say
he
was
dropping
in
to
see
me
while
working
on
the
manuscript
of
this
book
i
thought
i
heard
the
doorbell
as
i
was
typing
i
went
to
the
front
door
and
no
one
was
there
i
even
walked
around
the
house
looking
for
him
because
i
was
so
certain
i
heard
the
bell
this
is
another
example
of
an
ideomotor
action
i
told
my
friend
about
it
when
he
arrived
approximately
minutes
later
he
looked
at
me
rather
whimsically
and
we
both
shared
a
laugh
have
you
thought
you
heard
the
phone
ring
when
you
were
waiting
for
a
call
in
the
chapter
how
does
work
stress
was
laid
on
the
importance
of
the
technique
during
every
attempt
to
achieve
you
attempt
to
visualize
yourself
going
into
the
hypnotic
state
once
you
have
deepened
the
state
you
begin
the
process
of
visualizing
yourself
exactly
the
way
you
want
to
be
you
may
experience
difficulty
at
first
but
as
you
keep
at
it
you
will
be
able
to
picture
yourself
the
way
you
want
use
the
technique
whether
you
think
you
are
under
hypnosis
or
these
images
become
clear
as
you
constantly
hammer
home
these
suggestions
this
is
the
exact
procedure
necessary
and
you
need
complicate
it
let
us
suppose
that
you
are
getting
your
eyelids
to
close
at
the
count
of
three
and
have
achieved
a
good
state
of
relaxation
with
these
prerequisites
you
can
anticipate
going
deeper
into
the
hypnotic
state
actually
being
able
to
get
the
eyes
to
close
at
a
specific
count
is
the
first
test
in
determining
if
the
subject
has
gone
under
hypnosis
if
you
have
conditioned
yourself
this
far
then
you
can
go
to
the
next
step
the
next
test
is
called
the
swallowing
test
you
mentally
give
yourself
suggestions
that
as
you
slowly
to
yourself
count
to
you
will
get
an
irresistible
urge
to
swallow
one
time
you
further
suggest
that
this
will
happen
even
before
you
reach
the
count
of
you
then
begin
the
count
one
my
throat
is
parched
and
i
feel
an
irresistible
urge
to
swallow
one
time
two
my
lips
are
becoming
very
dry
and
i
feel
an
irresistible
urge
to
swallow
three
my
throat
feels
very
dry
and
i
feel
an
irresistible
urge
to
swallow
one
time
four
before
i
reach
the
count
of
the
urge
to
swallow
one
time
will
become
irresistible
because
my
lips
and
throat
are
so
dry
five
once
i
swallow
i
shall
no
longer
have
the
urge
to
swallow
again
and
as
i
swallow
one
time
i
shall
fall
into
a
deeper
and
sounder
state
of
hypnosis
continue
with
similar
suggestions
repeating
and
affirming
the
suggestions
about
swallowing
once
you
actually
swallow
you
discontinue
the
suggestions
and
instead
give
yourself
suggestions
that
you
are
falling
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
sound
hypnotic
state
and
that
the
constructive
suggestions
you
now
give
yourself
will
work
for
you
once
again
you
practice
seeing
yourself
the
way
you
want
to
be
while
fortifying
this
image
with
forceful
positive
suggestions
you
close
by
giving
yourself
suggestions
that
you
will
enter
the
hypnotic
state
whenever
you
relax
for
five
minutes
and
count
to
three
the
suggestions
are
just
as
effective
whether
given
aloud
or
mentally
many
subjects
report
that
they
are
reluctant
when
it
comes
to
giving
suggestions
to
themselves
i
can
only
say
that
as
you
continue
to
work
with
yourself
you
will
develop
confidence
in
giving
yourself
suggestions
in
order
for
the
suggestions
to
be
effective
they
can
not
be
given
in
a
reticent
or
hesitant
manner
they
must
be
given
with
enthusiasm
and
anticipation
if
you
assiduously
follow
these
instructions
you
will
derive
the
benefits
you
seek
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
witness
the
positive
tangible
results
of
your
suggestions
and
efforts
in
the
next
chapter
you
learn
how
to
deepen
the
state
chapter
deepening
the
state
for
each
progressive
test
it
is
usually
necessary
to
have
accomplished
the
preceding
tests
however
this
is
not
an
absolute
rule
frequently
a
subject
responds
to
tests
at
the
beginning
of
the
depth
scale
and
then
to
others
at
the
end
of
the
depth
scale
certain
tests
in
between
do
not
work
i
have
had
the
following
experience
more
than
once
while
teaching
one
of
my
classes
in
in
testing
the
depth
of
hypnosis
i
run
the
gamut
of
all
of
the
tests
from
light
to
deep
in
this
way
the
subject
can
ascertain
how
far
he
has
progressed
one
frequent
test
for
the
deep
state
is
to
give
the
subject
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
to
the
effect
that
the
next
cigarette
he
smokes
will
have
a
vile
taste
and
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
take
more
than
three
puffs
it
is
further
suggested
that
after
the
third
puff
the
cigarette
taste
will
be
so
unbearable
it
will
become
necessary
for
him
to
extinguish
the
cigarette
we
can
expect
an
excellent
hypnotic
subject
to
comply
with
these
posthypnotic
suggestions
but
a
subject
who
has
even
passed
the
eye
closure
test
test
no
or
any
other
test
may
unexpectedly
react
perfectly
to
the
cigarette
test
which
we
know
is
a
standard
test
for
determining
if
the
subject
has
entered
into
a
deep
state
of
hypnosis
how
can
you
account
for
it
there
is
no
simple
or
positive
answer
if
we
had
given
him
this
particular
test
he
would
have
felt
that
he
making
progress
in
his
determination
to
become
a
good
hypnotic
subject
because
of
this
he
might
not
have
given
himself
therapeutic
suggestions
because
he
would
feel
he
had
reached
a
state
of
hypnosis
which
would
benefit
him
remember
follow
the
instructions
of
giving
yourself
whatever
therapeutic
suggestions
you
want
regardless
of
the
fact
that
you
feel
that
nothing
has
happened
i
have
seen
many
subjects
who
were
bewildered
because
certain
tests
did
not
work
yet
were
pleased
because
of
very
gratifying
overall
results
from
using
they
were
baffled
because
of
their
inability
to
pass
certain
tests
which
they
felt
were
a
prerequisite
to
the
success
of
constructive
suggestions
they
gave
themselves
it
is
commonly
felt
that
the
deeper
the
state
of
hypnosis
the
better
the
results
in
actual
practice
i
have
not
found
this
to
be
so
i
have
had
excellent
results
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
with
subjects
who
only
achieved
a
light
state
and
it
has
been
necessary
to
work
with
others
who
achieved
a
deep
state
of
hypnosis
for
a
longer
period
before
lasting
results
were
in
evidence
naturally
each
individual
presents
a
different
set
of
needs
and
even
though
the
symptoms
may
be
basically
the
same
each
will
respond
favorably
when
his
requirements
are
met
this
happens
on
a
conscious
as
well
as
unconscious
level
for
example
the
mere
assurance
by
a
physician
that
the
patient
is
all
right
and
has
nothing
to
worry
about
is
often
sufficient
to
bring
about
desirable
results
another
example
is
the
mother
who
stops
the
sobbing
of
her
hurt
child
by
a
loving
kiss
a
logical
approach
pointing
out
to
the
child
that
he
really
did
hurt
himself
would
never
have
worked
we
have
all
heard
stories
of
primitive
tribesmen
who
have
died
because
they
knew
they
were
the
objects
of
death
wishes
by
another
member
of
the
tribe
the
key
to
achieving
a
greater
depth
of
lies
in
the
use
of
the
technique
you
see
yourself
going
into
the
hypnotic
state
deeper
and
deeper
you
even
picture
yourself
using
this
technique
passing
various
progressive
hypnotic
tests
the
second
part
of
the
key
lies
in
giving
yourself
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
each
succeeding
attempt
will
put
you
into
a
deeper
state
as
a
result
of
a
given
stimulus
such
as
the
count
of
three
the
following
instructions
should
not
be
attempted
usually
unless
you
have
been
successful
in
achieving
the
two
basic
tests
the
eye
closure
as
well
as
the
uncontrollable
urge
to
swallow
followed
by
the
physical
act
of
swallowing
at
a
specific
count
if
the
conditioning
process
works
for
these
two
tests
you
have
achieved
the
lethargic
state
of
hypnosis
this
is
the
first
state
of
hypnosis
and
is
generally
referred
to
as
the
light
state
therapeutic
suggestions
can
work
admirably
in
this
state
the
next
stage
of
hypnosis
is
known
as
the
cataleptic
state
and
is
referred
to
as
the
medium
state
generally
hypnosis
is
divided
into
three
states
the
lethargic
light
state
the
cataleptic
medium
state
and
the
somnambulistic
deep
state
as
you
deepen
the
hypnotic
state
you
can
accomplish
the
progressive
tests
that
i
shall
outline
for
you
i
also
number
these
tests
for
the
convenience
of
having
a
reference
deepening
the
hypnotic
state
requires
the
same
type
of
practice
or
conditioning
as
the
first
two
steps
let
us
call
eye
closure
no
and
swallowing
no
we
are
now
ready
to
proceed
to
the
hand
tingling
test
no
you
have
just
completed
tests
no
and
you
are
in
a
completely
relaxed
state
now
give
yourself
the
following
suggestions
as
i
count
to
ten
and
even
before
i
reach
the
count
of
ten
i
shall
feel
a
light
tingling
or
numb
feeling
in
my
right
hand
as
you
slowly
begin
the
count
of
ten
you
keep
repeating
suggestions
to
the
effect
that
your
right
hand
is
beginning
to
tingle
once
again
you
practice
the
technique
of
tapping
your
experiential
background
for
this
feeling
you
can
recall
how
it
feels
when
your
hand
goes
to
sleep
once
you
get
an
initial
feeling
of
lightness
tingling
or
numbness
reinforce
this
feeling
by
the
technique
as
you
did
with
the
eye
closure
test
as
you
practice
this
procedure
it
will
work
with
greater
effectiveness
the
following
is
a
very
important
point
to
remember
be
sure
that
you
give
yourself
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
the
tingling
light
or
numb
sensation
will
disappear
as
you
continue
to
count
to
for
example
as
i
count
to
the
tingling
feeling
in
my
right
hand
will
disappear
and
i
shall
experience
only
normal
sensations
eleven
the
tingling
feeling
is
leaving
twelve
now
it
is
leaving
faster
thirteen
i
can
feel
my
hand
returning
to
normal
fourteen
the
tingling
feeling
has
left
fifteen
my
right
hand
feels
perfectly
normal
you
could
try
a
variation
of
this
test
by
saying
your
nose
or
one
of
your
toes
will
itch
at
a
specific
count
once
this
test
is
accomplished
you
are
ready
for
the
foot
test
no
you
will
remember
that
the
key
to
achieving
a
greater
depth
of
hypnosis
lies
in
visualizing
yourself
going
deeper
with
each
attempt
and
accomplishing
progressive
hypnotic
tests
keep
this
in
mind
for
a
moment
let
us
go
back
to
the
hand
tingling
test
no
once
you
have
been
successful
in
accomplishing
this
test
use
the
technique
to
see
yourself
successfully
responding
to
the
foot
test
when
you
have
actually
accomplished
test
no
you
see
yourself
accomplishing
the
hand
levitation
test
no
in
other
words
you
use
each
step
to
enhance
a
greater
receptivity
for
the
following
progressive
test
as
you
couple
this
approach
with
posthypnotic
suggestions
that
you
will
go
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
hypnotic
state
at
a
given
stimulus
you
set
into
motion
a
conditioned
response
mechanism
which
must
ultimately
guide
you
into
a
profound
state
of
hypnosis
the
foot
test
can
be
accomplished
while
sitting
or
lying
down
the
idea
of
this
test
is
to
imagine
that
your
feet
are
stuck
to
the
floor
or
that
your
legs
are
so
heavy
that
they
are
impossible
to
raise
until
you
reach
a
certain
count
it
is
best
to
begin
this
test
by
trying
to
capture
a
heavy
relaxed
feeling
in
your
legs
you
give
yourself
specific
suggestions
along
these
lines
as
i
count
to
five
i
shall
notice
a
very
heavy
relaxed
pleasant
feeling
in
both
legs
it
will
be
a
very
comfortable
feeling
a
feeling
of
complete
relaxation
you
then
begin
the
count
of
ten
following
out
the
idea
of
the
other
tests
you
have
successfully
accomplished
you
should
remember
that
there
is
no
time
limit
and
you
take
as
much
time
as
you
need
in
order
to
get
the
relaxed
heavy
feeling
once
you
get
the
relaxed
heavy
feeling
you
use
the
technique
to
try
to
picture
your
legs
stuck
to
the
floor
if
you
are
lying
down
imagine
you
are
covered
by
a
heavy
blanket
which
is
tightly
tucked
under
the
mattress
making
it
impossible
for
you
to
raise
your
legs
if
sitting
up
i
tell
the
subject
to
imagine
that
his
shoes
are
stuck
to
the
floor
with
iron
glue
and
since
his
feet
are
in
the
shoes
it
is
impossible
to
lift
them
until
the
specific
count
which
will
enable
him
to
do
so
here
are
the
suggestions
you
can
use
for
the
second
part
of
this
test
as
i
continue
to
count
to
ten
i
shall
find
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
raise
my
legs
i
shall
try
at
the
count
of
ten
but
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
to
raise
my
legs
until
i
count
to
at
that
time
i
shall
be
able
to
raise
my
legs
easily
and
the
heavy
feeling
will
leave
as
well
you
then
continue
with
the
count
giving
yourself
appropriate
suggestions
once
this
test
is
accomplished
you
use
the
technique
to
see
yourself
accomplishing
the
hand
levitation
test
no
be
sure
you
give
yourself
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
the
next
time
you
hypnotize
yourself
you
will
fall
into
a
deeper
and
sounder
state
i
assume
that
you
have
been
able
to
get
a
relaxed
heavy
feeling
in
your
legs
you
have
reached
the
count
of
five
and
are
ready
to
proceed
further
here
are
sample
suggestions
you
can
use
six
my
legs
are
becoming
extremely
heavy
seven
i
be
unable
to
lift
them
until
i
count
to
eight
i
feel
very
comfortable
my
legs
are
becoming
heavier
and
heavier
nine
my
entire
body
is
completely
relaxed
and
my
legs
are
so
heavy
that
they
are
impossible
to
lift
ten
i
in
a
very
deep
hypnotic
state
and
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
me
to
move
my
legs
until
i
count
to
at
this
point
you
actually
try
to
raise
your
legs
if
you
ca
do
it
you
have
reached
the
cataleptic
stage
should
you
not
be
able
to
raise
your
legs
do
become
frightened
all
you
need
to
say
is
i
can
now
move
my
legs
you
could
also
say
as
i
count
to
three
i
be
able
to
move
my
legs
however
since
we
have
elected
originally
to
be
able
to
move
the
legs
at
the
count
of
it
would
be
best
to
follow
out
this
pattern
you
could
at
this
time
merely
continue
to
count
to
at
which
time
you
would
be
able
to
move
your
legs
i
prefer
giving
suggestions
between
each
count
as
follows
eleven
the
heavy
feeling
is
leaving
and
i
shall
be
able
to
raise
my
legs
at
the
count
of
twelve
i
can
feel
the
heavy
relaxed
feeling
leaving
thirteen
i
am
beginning
to
move
my
legs
fourteen
i
am
lifting
my
legs
more
and
more
fifteen
i
have
perfect
control
over
my
bodily
functions
and
legs
i
am
lifting
and
moving
my
legs
the
heavy
feeling
is
dissipating
i
am
in
complete
control
i
can
now
give
myself
posthypnotic
suggestions
that
will
be
very
effective
and
beneficial
give
yourself
whatever
suggestions
you
want
at
this
time
let
us
suppose
that
you
tried
the
foot
test
for
some
time
and
were
unsuccessful
perhaps
this
puzzles
you
and
you
wonder
why
it
work
perhaps
you
were
able
to
get
a
heavy
feeling
in
the
legs
but
the
second
part
of
the
test
did
work
the
following
information
will
help
you
to
understand
why
you
were
unable
to
complete
this
cataleptic
test
either
you
had
not
conditioned
yourself
sufficiently
or
you
really
letting
go
enough
to
enter
into
a
deeper
state
of
hypnosis
most
subjects
need
to
test
themselves
and
feel
secure
every
step
of
the
way
they
do
just
plunge
into
the
cataleptic
or
somnambulistic
stages
immediately
in
this
connection
i
believe
it
can
be
compared
with
the
bather
who
goes
into
the
water
one
step
at
a
time
even
the
playful
splashing
directed
at
him
by
friends
does
not
compel
him
to
duck
under
the
water
instead
he
continues
to
slowly
go
deeper
and
deeper
until
he
is
completely
submerged
would
it
have
been
easier
to
duck
under
all
at
once
perhaps
but
i
sure
you
have
either
experienced
the
same
thing
yourself
or
seen
it
happen
the
analogy
should
be
clear
the
subject
is
reluctant
to
do
what
he
considers
as
giving
up
his
control
when
in
reality
he
is
really
more
and
more
in
control
of
himself
as
he
penetrates
the
deeper
levels
of
hypnosis
in
reality
the
subject
who
does
not
or
can
not
raise
his
feet
really
could
move
in
case
of
emergency
even
without
counting
to
he
has
in
effect
entered
into
a
state
in
which
it
is
too
much
bother
to
lift
his
feet
a
common
example
of
this
frame
of
mind
is
when
you
remain
in
bed
in
the
morning
even
though
you
know
you
will
be
late
to
work
you
are
just
too
comfortable
to
move
and
your
initiative
seems
paralyzed
let
us
assume
at
this
point
that
you
have
finally
succeeded
in
getting
the
foot
test
to
work
you
are
now
ready
for
the
hand
levitation
test
no
in
this
test
the
goal
is
to
get
your
hand
to
slowly
rise
and
touch
your
chin
once
it
touches
your
chin
you
enter
into
a
still
deeper
state
and
lower
your
hand
slowly
to
your
side
this
test
is
actually
combined
with
the
hand
tingling
test
no
since
you
have
been
successful
with
test
no
the
rest
is
rather
simple
this
time
as
you
work
test
no
aim
for
a
light
pleasant
feeling
in
your
right
hand
once
you
get
this
reaction
you
give
yourself
suggestions
that
your
right
hand
will
now
rise
and
touch
your
chin
as
soon
as
it
does
you
will
fall
into
a
deeper
state
and
lower
your
hand
here
are
the
suggestions
that
you
can
use
as
i
count
to
ten
and
even
before
i
reach
the
count
of
ten
i
shall
have
an
irresistible
impulse
to
slowly
raise
my
hand
to
my
chin
as
i
progress
with
the
counting
my
hand
will
slowly
rise
and
the
impulse
will
become
stronger
and
stronger
as
soon
as
my
hand
touches
my
chin
the
impulse
will
leave
i
will
then
lower
my
hand
and
fall
into
a
very
deep
hypnotic
state
i
shall
be
fully
aware
of
what
is
happening
my
surroundings
and
will
be
able
to
give
myself
beneficial
posthypnotic
suggestions
at
this
point
you
start
counting
to
ten
giving
yourself
suggestions
that
your
right
hand
which
already
has
a
light
feeling
will
begin
to
slowly
rise
to
your
chin
time
the
counting
to
coincide
with
the
actual
physical
act
of
raising
your
hand
you
are
trying
to
feel
an
involuntary
urge
to
raise
your
hand
the
movement
itself
should
also
be
of
an
unconscious
rather
than
conscious
nature
a
conscious
raising
of
your
hand
to
your
chin
is
not
what
you
are
looking
for
in
this
test
should
you
experience
difficulty
in
attaining
the
first
movement
of
your
hand
you
can
give
yourself
assistance
by
consciously
and
slowly
raising
your
hand
just
to
get
it
started
the
rest
of
the
movement
as
mentioned
must
be
automatic
should
you
find
it
necessary
to
start
your
hand
rising
use
the
technique
to
continue
the
movement
you
can
give
yourself
the
following
suggestions
one
my
right
hand
is
beginning
to
rise
two
my
right
hand
is
very
very
light
and
i
am
getting
an
irresistible
urge
to
slowly
raise
it
three
this
feeling
is
getting
stronger
and
stronger
four
my
right
hand
is
rising
more
and
more
five
my
hand
is
rising
toward
my
chin
six
as
soon
as
my
hand
touches
my
chin
i
shall
fall
into
a
deeper
and
sounder
state
of
hypnosis
seven
my
hand
is
rising
closer
and
closer
toward
my
chin
eight
the
feeling
of
lightness
is
becoming
stronger
and
stronger
nine
my
right
hand
is
about
to
touch
my
chin
as
soon
as
it
does
i
fall
into
a
very
deep
hypnotic
state
ten
my
right
hand
is
touching
my
chin
i
falling
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
sound
hypnotic
state
i
now
slowly
lower
my
hand
and
continue
falling
into
a
deep
sound
pleasant
state
of
hypnosis
the
light
feeling
has
left
my
hand
you
should
not
attempt
to
memorize
the
exact
phraseology
for
any
of
the
tests
you
are
to
merely
use
the
suggestions
that
have
been
written
out
for
you
as
a
guide
the
timing
of
the
suggestions
is
the
paramount
consideration
in
attaining
successful
results
do
be
impatient
take
as
much
time
as
you
need
should
you
find
yourself
unsuccessful
after
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
drop
the
test
and
come
back
to
it
another
day
i
have
found
that
working
at
a
specific
test
all
day
long
accomplishes
the
end
result
it
is
best
to
work
for
a
specific
period
every
day
in
this
way
the
conditioned
response
pattern
is
established
for
the
success
of
the
tests
as
well
as
the
success
of
the
posthypnotic
suggestions
that
you
have
given
yourself
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
if
you
have
been
successful
in
achieving
the
first
five
tests
you
have
reached
a
medium
state
of
hypnosis
and
posthypnotic
suggestions
will
be
extremely
effective
in
the
next
chapter
you
learn
psychologically
how
to
go
even
deeper
into
hypnosis
you
learn
those
psychological
factors
that
are
important
to
know
and
that
can
contribute
to
your
development
into
an
excellent
hypnotic
subject
following
this
the
subsequent
chapter
will
give
you
further
tests
and
instructions
for
developing
into
a
somnambulistic
subject
chapter
what
you
should
know
about
becoming
an
excellent
subject
becoming
an
excellent
subject
follows
the
same
general
rules
for
becoming
proficient
in
any
other
endeavor
it
depends
upon
your
motivation
persistence
and
willingness
to
devote
time
and
study
to
the
subject
let
us
agree
that
most
individuals
can
learn
to
play
a
musical
instrument
to
some
degree
this
degree
is
usually
sufficient
for
their
own
needs
to
become
a
virtuoso
however
it
is
necessary
to
study
the
instrument
and
devote
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
time
to
practice
the
same
example
could
be
given
for
most
undertakings
anyone
can
learn
to
hit
a
golf
ball
but
being
able
to
control
the
direction
and
distance
and
become
a
skilled
golfer
is
quite
another
matter
if
you
have
been
successful
in
accomplishing
the
first
five
tests
you
can
consider
yourself
a
good
hypnotic
subject
becoming
an
excellent
subject
entails
following
the
same
procedure
used
in
accomplishing
the
first
five
tests
some
may
proceed
very
easily
into
the
somnambulistic
state
and
others
may
have
a
difficult
time
reaching
this
deepest
stage
understanding
some
of
the
psychology
involved
and
assuming
the
right
psychological
frame
of
mind
for
the
attainment
of
the
somnambulistic
state
is
more
important
than
just
working
blindly
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
somnambulistic
tests
to
work
being
irritable
disgusted
and
despondent
because
of
your
inability
to
go
further
into
hypnosis
is
not
the
answer
and
will
only
lead
to
frustration
and
failure
the
reader
is
not
to
assume
he
will
be
a
difficult
subject
if
you
have
come
this
far
you
be
able
to
continue
in
the
same
manner
the
topic
under
discussion
now
is
brought
up
to
prepare
readers
for
any
contingency
that
may
arise
it
like
having
a
life
preserver
on
a
boat
you
hope
you
never
need
it
but
you
should
be
prepared
to
use
it
in
case
of
an
emergency
it
is
natural
to
assume
that
if
you
are
willing
and
trying
to
go
into
the
lethargic
cataleptic
or
somnambulistic
state
you
will
be
able
to
do
so
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
unfortunately
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
many
of
the
principles
of
learning
and
conditioning
can
be
applied
to
hypnosis
but
with
many
subjects
these
laws
do
not
seem
applicable
let
us
assume
you
wanted
to
learn
to
become
an
excellent
typist
this
is
a
reasonable
goal
and
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
continue
practicing
until
you
have
reached
the
proficiency
you
set
out
to
achieve
this
proficiency
would
as
a
rule
follow
application
of
the
laws
of
learning
and
conditioning
this
is
always
so
in
a
subject
attempt
to
become
somnambulistic
when
the
subject
progresses
from
one
stage
to
another
in
a
classical
manner
the
theory
works
admirably
but
what
happens
when
a
subject
can
not
seem
to
progress
any
further
he
has
reached
a
plateau
and
is
unable
to
climb
higher
he
seems
to
have
reached
a
psychological
impasse
or
stalemate
it
is
easy
to
say
that
the
subject
is
thwarted
by
a
subconscious
block
and
let
it
go
at
that
this
however
does
help
him
in
his
dilemma
it
like
telling
the
stranded
motorist
that
the
reason
his
car
has
stalled
is
because
the
motor
is
running
the
following
information
will
be
helpful
to
those
who
have
been
able
to
reach
the
first
stages
of
hypnosis
as
well
as
those
who
apparently
can
go
only
so
far
actually
the
same
principles
are
involved
if
the
subject
does
respond
or
responds
to
a
limited
degree
there
evidently
is
a
cause
or
reason
for
this
poor
response
in
order
to
continue
this
discussion
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
agree
that
the
resistance
can
be
either
conscious
or
unconscious
if
the
subject
insists
that
he
is
trying
to
let
go
has
nothing
to
hide
is
not
afraid
of
hypnosis
understands
what
is
involved
and
has
strong
motivation
we
can
only
assume
that
the
resistance
must
be
unconscious
usually
it
will
be
necessary
to
work
through
this
unconscious
resistance
before
the
subject
responds
if
the
subject
is
conditioning
himself
this
will
involve
a
great
deal
of
introspection
and
even
then
it
is
an
extremely
difficult
job
one
does
usually
have
proper
insight
into
one
own
emotional
the
end
result
is
that
one
can
only
rationalize
about
his
behavior
let
us
explore
some
interesting
aspects
of
hypnosis
with
a
view
toward
helping
you
if
you
are
having
difficulty
responding
the
way
you
desire
i
have
had
the
following
paradoxical
situation
happen
many
times
a
subject
calls
my
office
requesting
to
be
conditioned
for
he
further
requests
that
he
be
allowed
to
bring
along
a
member
of
his
family
or
a
friend
for
the
hypnotic
session
these
individuals
usually
ask
if
i
object
to
this
procedure
i
interpreted
this
request
as
a
sign
of
distrust
during
my
early
career
as
a
professional
hypnotist
i
was
affronted
by
the
idea
of
the
unspoken
insinuation
verbalized
by
this
request
did
they
trust
me
between
trying
to
defend
myself
and
assuring
them
that
there
was
no
need
for
another
person
being
present
since
my
secretary
could
observe
the
procedure
i
usually
won
the
argument
but
lost
the
client
as
i
developed
understanding
into
the
needs
of
these
persons
i
began
to
realize
that
the
request
was
not
directed
at
my
integrity
but
was
a
safeguard
for
their
ego
illustration
here
is
an
interesting
sidelight
that
has
happened
frequently
in
regard
to
the
foregoing
situation
i
would
request
the
subject
to
sit
near
my
desk
and
tell
the
onlooker
to
sit
in
back
and
to
the
side
of
the
subject
away
from
the
subject
view
so
as
not
to
distract
him
in
this
situation
i
invariably
place
the
hypnodisc
on
a
spinning
portable
phonograph
turntable
and
turn
it
upright
for
the
subject
to
look
at
the
hypnodisc
which
is
made
of
stiff
cardboard
looks
like
a
phonograph
record
and
has
concentric
heavy
lines
drawn
on
it
as
it
spins
the
subject
feels
he
is
being
pulled
toward
the
center
at
the
same
time
it
causes
his
eyes
to
become
very
tired
i
have
included
a
drawing
of
it
on
this
page
for
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
this
hypnotic
device
the
revolving
hypnodisc
causes
a
physiological
reaction
and
must
work
with
everyone
you
feed
back
certain
known
physiological
responses
for
the
successful
attainment
of
hypnosis
the
onlooker
has
no
choice
but
to
look
at
the
hypnodisc
as
well
as
i
suggest
to
the
subject
that
his
eyes
are
becoming
heavy
and
tired
and
that
soon
he
have
an
irresistible
impulse
to
close
them
the
onlooker
is
naturally
hearing
the
same
suggestion
because
this
person
feels
apart
from
the
hypnotic
situation
there
can
be
no
conscious
resistance
since
these
defenses
are
not
hampering
the
attainment
of
hypnosis
the
onlooker
may
readily
fall
under
hypnosis
more
than
once
the
onlooker
has
confided
to
me
that
he
was
getting
a
better
night
sleep
was
feeling
wonderfully
well
or
had
derived
other
benefits
since
coming
to
my
office
as
an
observer
the
exact
situation
happens
when
the
stage
hypnotist
is
hypnotizing
subjects
on
the
stage
many
times
a
person
in
the
audience
who
had
no
intention
of
becoming
hypnotized
becomes
influenced
in
the
same
manner
incidentally
these
individuals
make
the
best
subjects
there
are
interesting
theories
as
to
why
a
subject
responds
or
does
not
respond
to
hypnosis
i
think
the
reader
would
find
some
of
these
theories
interesting
and
perhaps
gain
some
insight
into
his
own
hypnotic
behavior
these
theories
are
based
primarily
on
a
psychoanalytical
approach
to
hypnosis
the
most
prevalent
theory
is
that
the
hypnotist
represents
either
the
father
image
paternal
or
fear
hypnosis
or
the
mother
image
maternal
or
love
hypnosis
the
father
usually
represents
an
authoritarian
figure
the
subject
identification
can
be
on
a
conscious
or
subconscious
level
let
us
suppose
the
subject
has
ambivalent
feelings
toward
his
father
because
of
this
he
may
not
respond
here
is
an
opportunity
to
frustrate
the
authoritative
father
figure
the
only
trouble
with
this
theory
is
that
if
there
is
an
excellent
relationship
between
the
father
and
subject
it
does
necessarily
mean
that
the
subject
will
respond
easily
the
stage
hypnotist
invariably
uses
a
strong
authoritative
approach
with
a
great
deal
of
success
but
this
approach
generally
does
not
work
best
in
private
practice
i
have
found
that
for
the
majority
of
subjects
the
maternal
approach
works
best
perhaps
the
process
of
hypnosis
awakens
early
unconscious
memories
of
being
put
to
sleep
as
a
child
some
techniques
that
are
used
in
hypnosis
are
quite
similar
to
this
the
subject
who
is
lying
down
is
told
to
close
his
eyes
and
is
spoken
to
in
a
quiet
reassuring
monotonous
tone
of
voice
the
hypnotist
is
seated
near
him
the
hypnotist
even
uses
the
same
words
that
the
subject
has
heard
as
a
child
sleep
go
to
sleep
when
you
awaken
you
feel
wonderfully
well
in
fact
i
use
some
special
music
that
i
had
recorded
for
inducing
hypnosis
the
first
musical
selection
is
brahms
lullaby
children
music
boxes
invariably
contain
this
selection
and
the
melody
can
not
help
but
activate
a
pleasant
nostalgia
it
is
a
memory
associated
with
love
and
tenderness
this
brings
us
to
the
fact
that
hypnosis
may
offer
the
subject
a
chance
to
escape
from
the
reality
of
pressing
problems
into
a
state
of
complete
irresponsibility
in
fact
one
theory
of
hypnosis
equates
the
hypnotic
state
as
a
form
of
unconscious
regression
and
need
for
submission
the
male
subject
may
have
a
strong
positive
identification
with
his
mother
rather
than
his
father
it
is
part
of
the
unresolved
oedipus
complex
he
sees
his
mother
as
a
kind
loving
individual
always
ready
to
help
even
if
the
mother
did
something
socially
unacceptable
the
individual
would
defend
her
vehemently
the
father
who
might
do
something
wrong
would
rarely
be
excused
just
the
opposite
is
true
with
the
female
subject
when
asking
the
female
child
whose
girl
are
you
the
answer
is
invariably
daddy
girl
when
asking
the
male
child
whose
boy
are
you
the
answer
is
invariably
momma
boy
we
accept
this
transference
of
identification
as
a
normal
process
of
growing
up
when
it
is
normally
resolved
it
can
account
for
severe
personality
problems
one
might
assume
therefore
that
a
woman
hypnotist
could
better
hypnotize
a
male
subject
and
a
male
hypnotist
could
better
hypnotize
a
female
subject
but
this
is
not
true
except
for
cases
such
as
we
have
just
mentioned
one
school
of
thought
feels
that
there
is
a
strong
submissive
tendency
in
all
of
us
and
hypnosis
gratifies
this
wish
the
individual
need
for
dependence
is
also
met
in
this
case
the
hypnotist
becomes
omnipotent
being
able
to
alter
feelings
that
ordinarily
distress
the
individual
normally
adults
when
confronted
by
a
particularly
upsetting
experience
might
want
to
be
held
closely
by
an
intimate
friend
or
member
of
the
family
do
we
frequently
put
our
arm
around
a
friend
in
grief
trying
to
comfort
him
the
inner
strength
which
is
created
by
hypnosis
within
the
total
personality
structure
of
the
subject
lessens
dependency
upon
the
hypnotist
much
in
the
same
fashion
that
we
need
the
doctor
less
as
we
start
to
recover
from
an
illness
further
lessens
dependency
for
no
authoritarian
figure
is
used
the
subject
attitude
towards
authority
is
important
to
know
it
is
that
officers
in
the
army
are
more
difficult
to
hypnotize
than
noncommissioned
men
the
enlisted
man
by
a
process
of
indoctrination
and
conditioning
is
taught
to
obey
and
follow
orders
without
reasoning
the
transference
of
authority
to
the
hypnotist
is
readily
accomplished
because
of
this
conditioning
process
the
army
doctor
when
treating
patients
psychologically
replaces
his
army
jacket
with
a
regular
white
medical
jacket
to
increase
rapport
one
interesting
theory
is
that
the
subject
responds
as
he
thinks
the
hypnotist
would
like
him
to
this
is
termed
role
playing
when
asking
a
subject
under
hypnosis
his
name
you
usually
get
a
very
slow
deliberate
answer
as
though
the
subject
were
in
a
trance
you
tell
him
that
he
can
answer
in
a
normal
speaking
voice
and
tempo
and
his
further
replies
are
to
be
in
the
same
manner
as
his
waking
state
another
theory
along
these
lines
is
that
the
subject
acts
as
he
believes
a
hypnotized
person
would
act
this
too
is
role
playing
but
it
does
not
explain
analgesia
such
as
when
the
dentist
hypnotizes
the
patient
and
proceeds
to
drill
a
tooth
no
one
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
highly
neurotic
psychic
masochist
is
going
to
endure
excruciating
pain
just
to
please
the
doctor
one
theory
about
hypnosis
states
that
it
allows
the
subject
an
opportunity
of
identifying
with
the
hypnotist
whom
he
sees
as
a
powerful
figure
through
this
identification
the
subject
is
able
to
gain
inner
strength
on
the
other
hand
the
subject
might
rebel
against
the
submissive
nature
of
the
hypnotic
setting
this
could
easily
create
anxiety
which
in
turn
could
create
hostility
resulting
in
resistance
of
various
kinds
as
a
result
of
this
the
subject
might
begin
to
criticize
the
hypnotist
find
fault
with
the
way
he
the
subject
is
being
handled
question
the
judgment
of
the
hypnotist
or
doubt
the
effectiveness
of
the
hypnotic
procedure
many
investigators
assert
that
the
rapport
meaning
the
relationship
between
the
subject
and
hypnotist
is
all
important
this
is
true
and
the
relationship
can
and
does
have
many
ramifications
in
psychotherapy
the
term
transference
is
used
to
denote
this
relationship
the
relationship
is
further
described
as
a
good
or
bad
transference
there
is
also
a
countertransference
which
indicates
the
reaction
of
the
therapist
to
the
patient
naturally
in
order
for
the
subject
to
respond
there
must
be
good
rapport
i
have
tried
to
indicate
that
there
are
complexities
that
may
arise
in
the
hypnotic
setting
there
are
many
conflicting
theories
as
to
why
a
subject
does
or
does
not
respond
there
are
no
set
rules
to
follow
and
one
intuition
experience
and
judgment
help
solve
any
problem
that
arises
let
me
relate
another
frequent
incident
i
have
had
subjects
come
to
me
after
they
were
unable
to
be
hypnotized
by
several
other
professional
hypnotists
they
have
complained
that
the
hypnotists
were
good
hypnotists
because
they
could
hypnotize
them
after
all
they
ask
had
they
been
willing
subjects
my
usual
answer
is
that
the
fault
if
there
is
one
is
not
with
the
hypnotists
and
really
not
with
the
subjects
it
is
a
matter
of
exploring
what
has
happened
and
then
deciding
on
a
course
of
action
to
insure
success
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
the
subject
responds
when
he
is
positively
without
equivocation
ready
to
do
so
he
keeps
testing
the
response
to
make
sure
he
is
in
control
he
fears
a
reduction
in
his
voluntary
level
of
reality
attachment
and
control
unresponsiveness
proves
to
him
that
he
has
this
control
as
long
as
he
does
this
which
is
a
natural
response
he
never
lets
go
sufficiently
to
attain
hypnosis
hypnosis
as
we
know
is
a
very
sensitive
state
it
requires
complete
faith
and
trust
in
the
hypnotist
if
it
is
lacking
the
subject
never
does
respond
the
phenomenon
of
hypnosis
is
entirely
subjective
in
nature
and
its
success
lies
within
the
total
personality
structure
of
the
subject
if
there
is
resistance
to
hypnosis
itself
or
to
deepening
the
state
the
subject
by
his
own
honest
evaluation
and
verbalization
of
his
resistance
can
do
much
to
become
a
better
subject
hypnosis
must
begin
with
the
acceptance
by
the
subject
of
certain
basic
fundamentals
that
we
have
already
discussed
rather
than
of
the
forcefulness
of
the
hypnotist
the
deepening
of
the
hypnotic
state
lies
in
the
intensification
of
the
conditioned
response
mechanism
once
it
has
been
initiated
you
should
not
expect
to
achieve
immediate
results
although
sometimes
this
does
happen
as
you
continue
to
work
with
perseverance
intelligence
and
enthusiasm
you
will
definitely
achieve
the
goals
that
you
have
set
for
yourself
it
is
well
to
remember
that
you
guide
yourself
toward
the
somnambulistic
state
depending
upon
your
belief
and
acceptance
of
those
principles
that
have
been
outlined
for
you
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
some
of
the
salient
points
and
theories
to
keep
in
mind
in
your
attempt
to
develop
into
an
excellent
hypnotic
subject
some
of
these
only
pertain
to
the
situations
where
the
hypnotist
works
with
the
subject
many
of
the
problems
inherent
in
this
setting
are
not
applicable
to
the
situation
where
the
subject
is
hypnotizing
himself
both
settings
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
as
long
as
you
proceed
to
follow
the
instructions
given
you
you
can
feel
assured
that
you
will
finally
achieve
it
should
be
emphasized
that
it
is
vital
to
adopt
the
right
frame
of
mind
in
your
attempt
to
achieve
particularly
a
deep
state
if
you
approach
hypnosis
with
a
attitude
nothing
is
going
to
happen
requires
practicing
a
set
of
mental
exercises
or
mental
gymnastics
to
acquire
the
ultimate
from
this
training
requires
systematic
conditioning
the
word
training
is
used
quite
extensively
in
hypnotic
literature
the
use
of
the
word
implies
that
hypnosis
can
be
attained
by
a
training
period
the
literature
speaks
frequently
of
a
subject
being
trained
to
respond
in
a
certain
way
obviously
this
means
over
a
certain
period
of
time
it
also
means
you
train
yourself
to
become
a
good
hypnotic
subject
it
is
a
skill
that
all
can
acquire
there
are
four
books
dealing
specifically
with
that
i
would
recommend
to
you
for
further
reading
they
are
is
by
andrew
salter
and
by
bernard
hollander
by
johannes
schultz
and
its
theory
technique
and
by
melvin
powers
chapter
techniques
for
reaching
the
somnambulistic
state
as
indicated
in
the
last
chapter
the
attainment
of
the
somnambulistic
stage
of
hypnosis
can
represent
an
extremely
intricate
procedure
because
of
certain
inherent
characteristics
of
this
stage
it
is
easier
to
attain
by
however
this
does
not
preclude
the
fact
that
it
can
be
reached
without
the
aid
of
a
hypnotist
more
important
than
the
testing
and
deepening
procedures
that
i
shall
outline
for
you
in
this
chapter
are
an
and
an
of
some
of
the
complexities
involved
first
in
achieving
the
hypnotic
state
then
deepening
and
finally
reaching
somnambulism
there
are
no
absolute
or
final
answers
to
many
of
the
problems
that
can
arise
you
can
become
entangled
with
rationalization
so
easily
when
you
want
the
facts
to
fit
a
particular
theory
i
point
this
out
to
the
reader
because
as
the
subject
goes
deeper
the
procedure
can
become
more
complicated
there
are
many
interesting
phenomena
which
can
be
elicited
in
the
somnambulistic
state
they
are
of
interest
for
the
most
part
to
students
of
abnormal
behavior
and
are
pertinent
from
an
academic
viewpoint
they
do
not
fall
within
the
province
of
this
book
or
of
hypnosis
for
therapeutic
purposes
and
might
lead
the
reader
astray
should
readers
be
interested
in
further
hypnotic
phenomena
i
refer
them
to
by
leslie
kuhn
and
salvadore
russo
by
leslie
lecron
distortion
in
by
milton
erickson
and
lynn
cooper
and
an
objective
study
in
by
andré
weitzenhoffer
as
discussed
previously
some
individuals
experience
difficulty
in
attaining
the
deeper
hypnotic
states
my
advice
is
to
be
patient
and
to
continue
working
with
yourself
it
is
not
imperative
or
vital
to
reach
the
somnambulistic
stage
for
therapeutic
results
it
is
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
many
students
that
they
must
go
into
the
deepest
state
possible
to
obtain
results
dramatic
changes
can
come
about
at
all
levels
of
hypnosis
the
somnambulistic
state
is
necessary
in
hypnotherapy
when
there
is
a
need
for
the
patient
to
relive
some
traumatic
episode
it
is
also
useful
when
the
patient
is
reluctant
to
consciously
discuss
certain
aspects
of
his
problem
many
hypnotherapeutic
techniques
such
as
amnesia
hypermnesia
progression
paramnesia
automatic
writing
dream
induction
regression
production
of
experimental
conflicts
and
crystal
or
mirror
gazing
require
a
somnambulistic
state
for
those
of
you
interested
in
hypnotherapy
i
can
recommend
no
finer
book
than
of
war
by
john
watkins
in
this
book
the
theory
of
hypnotherapy
has
been
diagramatically
presented
for
easy
comprehension
and
shown
to
be
an
amalgamation
of
concepts
and
practices
from
various
schools
of
thought
most
students
of
hypnosis
equate
the
phenomenon
of
amnesia
with
the
somnambulistic
state
the
mistake
they
make
is
in
trying
to
achieve
amnesia
it
similar
to
the
dog
trying
to
catch
his
tail
it
is
impossible
for
the
subject
to
effectively
suggest
amnesia
to
himself
if
he
remembers
what
he
was
supposed
to
forget
he
has
failed
if
he
truly
does
remember
what
he
was
supposed
to
forget
he
does
even
remember
the
amnesia
suggestion
and
can
take
no
satisfaction
from
his
success
because
he
is
not
aware
that
he
has
accomplished
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
unless
an
elaborate
set
of
posthypnotic
suggestions
are
worked
out
it
is
an
impossible
test
for
i
know
the
reader
is
anxious
to
begin
his
conditioning
for
the
somnambulistic
state
but
there
are
still
a
few
pertinent
remarks
which
should
be
remembered
before
proceeding
further
the
reader
should
not
memorize
verbatim
any
of
the
tests
involved
in
proving
the
somnambulistic
state
all
that
is
necessary
to
remember
is
the
general
form
and
the
goal
you
seek
the
goal
is
to
increase
your
suggestibility
which
in
turn
means
deepening
of
the
hypnotic
state
after
each
step
you
are
to
give
yourself
suggestions
that
you
will
go
still
deeper
the
next
time
you
should
also
designate
a
specific
length
of
time
to
work
with
the
suggestions
are
as
follows
i
shall
work
with
for
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
wonderfully
well
i
be
wide
awake
and
refreshed
in
case
of
any
danger
i
be
able
to
awaken
immediately
and
act
accordingly
some
hypnotists
tell
their
subjects
to
make
your
mind
a
blank
i
suppose
what
they
really
mean
is
that
you
must
try
to
think
of
only
what
the
hypnotist
is
saying
have
you
ever
tried
to
make
your
mind
a
blank
try
it
for
a
moment
it
an
impossibility
should
the
hypnotist
persist
along
these
lines
he
never
be
successful
it
is
the
wrong
approach
the
subject
because
of
his
inability
to
comply
with
this
suggestion
is
fighting
a
losing
battle
it
is
also
almost
impossible
for
the
subject
to
concentrate
only
on
what
the
hypnotist
is
saying
any
word
the
hypnotist
says
can
start
a
conscious
as
well
as
unconscious
train
of
thought
therefore
in
reality
this
too
is
impossible
however
it
really
is
necessary
that
the
subject
keep
his
thoughts
concentrated
solely
on
what
is
being
said
so
long
as
they
are
kept
in
the
general
area
at
times
the
more
you
try
to
concentrate
the
more
your
thoughts
become
scattered
suppose
i
say
to
you
forget
the
address
sunset
boulevard
what
happens
the
more
you
try
to
forget
it
the
more
you
remember
it
therefore
do
be
concerned
if
you
experience
stray
thoughts
during
the
induction
and
deepening
of
hypnosis
you
are
now
ready
to
continue
with
further
tests
the
first
five
tests
should
be
mastered
before
continuing
test
no
is
referred
to
as
the
fly
test
in
this
test
once
under
hypnosis
you
picture
that
a
fly
is
crawling
on
the
back
of
your
right
or
left
hand
once
you
feel
the
fly
you
know
you
are
deeply
hypnotized
you
might
even
get
an
urge
to
move
your
hand
and
flick
the
fly
off
your
hand
when
this
happens
you
know
of
course
that
you
are
deeply
hypnotized
here
is
a
sample
of
the
type
of
suggestions
to
give
as
i
count
to
ten
and
even
before
i
reach
the
count
of
ten
i
shall
feel
a
fly
crawling
on
the
back
of
my
right
hand
this
illusion
will
seem
very
real
to
me
one
my
right
hand
is
completely
relaxed
two
i
feel
completely
at
ease
three
i
am
beginning
to
feel
a
pleasant
tingling
feeling
on
the
back
of
my
right
hand
four
this
feeling
is
becoming
strong
five
it
feels
as
though
a
fly
is
moving
on
the
back
of
my
hand
six
i
have
had
this
same
feeling
before
seven
i
can
feel
the
fly
eight
the
feeling
is
very
definite
nine
as
i
flick
my
hand
the
fly
will
disappear
if
you
have
felt
the
fly
move
your
hand
ten
it
is
gone
test
no
is
known
as
the
cigarette
test
and
naturally
is
only
for
those
of
you
who
smoke
in
this
test
you
give
yourself
posthypnotic
suggestions
during
the
hypnotic
state
awaken
yourself
and
then
note
the
effects
of
the
posthypnotic
suggestions
if
the
cigarette
tastes
bitter
or
has
a
repugnant
taste
or
odor
and
if
you
furthermore
find
it
impossible
to
smoke
more
than
three
puffs
necessitating
your
putting
out
the
cigarette
you
know
the
posthypnotic
suggestions
are
working
perfectly
and
that
you
are
an
excellent
hypnotic
subject
here
are
the
suggestions
to
give
yourself
while
you
are
under
hypnosis
when
i
count
to
three
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
wonderfully
well
and
shall
have
a
strong
desire
to
smoke
a
cigarette
upon
lighting
the
cigarette
i
shall
notice
that
there
is
a
very
bitter
strong
and
repugnant
taste
to
the
cigarette
as
i
continue
to
smoke
the
cigarette
the
distasteful
effect
will
become
stronger
and
stronger
even
though
i
realize
that
i
have
given
myself
these
posthypnotic
suggestions
they
will
exert
a
strong
force
outside
of
my
conscious
control
and
i
shall
find
it
necessary
to
extinguish
the
cigarette
after
three
puffs
as
i
now
count
to
three
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
fine
one
two
three
test
no
is
called
the
sun
test
in
this
test
you
picture
yourself
in
a
bathing
suit
shorts
or
playsuit
at
the
beach
or
some
other
familiar
place
taking
a
sunbath
you
imagine
that
it
is
a
beautiful
summer
day
as
you
see
yourself
relaxed
you
imagine
that
a
cloud
is
blocking
out
the
sun
but
as
you
count
to
three
the
cloud
will
move
away
and
you
will
feel
the
warm
pleasant
glow
of
the
sun
rays
on
your
face
and
hands
here
are
the
suggestions
you
can
use
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
feel
the
warm
pleasant
rays
of
the
sun
on
my
face
and
hands
one
the
cloud
is
moving
and
i
can
begin
to
feel
the
warm
pleasant
rays
of
the
sun
two
the
cloud
is
moving
more
and
more
exposing
more
and
more
of
the
sun
i
can
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sun
rays
three
the
cloud
has
moved
away
from
the
sun
and
i
can
feel
the
full
warm
strength
of
the
sun
it
is
a
pleasant
feeling
but
as
i
continue
to
count
to
five
the
warm
feeling
will
dissipate
four
the
warm
feeling
is
leaving
five
the
warm
feeling
has
left
and
i
feel
perfectly
normal
in
every
respect
a
variation
of
this
test
is
to
see
yourself
lying
comfortably
in
front
of
a
fireplace
in
this
instance
you
imagine
someone
is
adding
wood
to
the
fire
as
this
is
done
you
feel
the
warm
glow
of
the
fire
more
and
more
should
you
use
the
fireplace
technique
try
to
incorporate
the
sound
of
rain
into
the
picture
if
you
hear
rain
you
have
created
a
positive
auditory
hallucination
and
can
consider
yourself
an
excellent
subject
you
can
also
visualize
a
situation
where
you
would
be
cold
this
is
not
as
pleasant
as
the
picture
that
one
can
conjure
up
about
a
fireplace
and
thus
creates
a
bit
more
resistance
since
no
one
wants
to
feel
uncomfortable
test
no
is
the
breeze
test
it
can
be
combined
with
the
previous
test
after
you
attain
the
feeling
of
warmth
you
give
yourself
a
count
of
three
or
whatever
number
you
want
suggesting
that
you
will
feel
the
cool
ocean
breeze
if
you
are
at
the
beach
on
your
face
and
hands
you
can
even
carry
this
step
further
suggesting
that
you
even
smell
the
odor
of
the
salt
water
this
is
known
as
an
olfactory
illusion
and
should
you
be
able
to
create
this
effect
you
can
be
sure
that
you
are
a
somnambulistic
subject
here
are
suggestions
you
can
use
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
gradually
feel
the
cool
ocean
breeze
coming
over
the
waves
it
will
be
a
very
pleasant
feeling
one
i
am
beginning
to
feel
the
cool
ocean
breeze
especially
on
my
face
and
hands
two
the
breeze
is
becoming
stronger
and
stronger
three
i
can
definitely
feel
the
cool
ocean
breeze
as
i
continue
to
count
to
five
i
shall
smell
the
pleasant
healthy
aroma
of
the
salt
water
four
i
am
beginning
to
smell
the
salt
water
five
i
can
definitely
smell
the
salt
water
now
you
give
yourself
appropriate
suggestions
that
the
feeling
illusion
will
vanish
as
you
awaken
or
at
a
specific
count
it
can
be
as
simple
as
this
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
awaken
feeling
very
refreshed
the
feeling
of
the
cool
ocean
breeze
and
smell
of
the
salt
air
will
have
vanished
completely
at
this
point
you
count
to
three
and
open
your
eyes
test
no
is
the
handclasp
test
this
is
used
frequently
to
test
the
depth
of
hypnosis
you
fold
your
hands
with
your
fingers
tightly
interlocked
and
place
your
palms
together
you
then
give
yourself
a
hypnotic
suggestion
that
at
the
count
of
three
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
unlock
your
hands
after
you
try
and
are
unable
to
unlock
your
hands
you
continue
counting
to
five
suggesting
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
so
when
you
reach
the
count
of
five
incidentally
you
should
remove
any
ring
you
may
be
wearing
before
trying
this
test
here
are
the
suggestions
you
can
follow
as
i
complete
the
count
of
three
i
shall
try
to
unlock
my
hands
but
will
be
unable
to
do
so
until
i
count
to
five
one
my
hands
are
locked
tightly
together
two
my
fingers
are
locked
tighter
and
tighter
three
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
unlock
my
hands
until
i
count
to
five
four
as
i
reach
the
count
of
five
i
shall
be
able
to
unlock
my
hands
very
easily
five
i
can
now
unlock
my
hands
very
easily
test
no
is
the
arm
test
here
is
another
test
used
frequently
to
test
the
receptiveness
to
hypnosis
make
a
tight
fist
and
extend
your
arm
in
front
of
you
as
far
as
possible
visualize
your
arm
as
one
solid
mass
as
stiff
and
rigid
as
a
bar
of
steel
after
your
arm
is
extended
give
yourself
a
hypnotic
suggestion
that
you
will
be
unable
to
bend
your
arm
when
you
complete
the
count
of
three
as
you
continue
to
count
to
five
you
will
be
able
to
bend
your
arm
very
easily
here
is
a
form
of
suggestion
you
can
use
as
i
reach
the
count
of
three
i
shall
try
to
bend
my
arm
but
it
will
be
impossible
to
do
so
until
i
count
to
five
no
matter
how
hard
i
try
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
one
my
arm
is
stiff
and
rigid
as
a
bar
of
steel
two
i
can
feel
the
rigidity
in
my
arm
three
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
bend
my
arm
until
i
count
to
five
four
i
can
feel
the
stiffness
slowly
leaving
five
i
can
now
bend
my
arm
easily
and
it
feels
normal
in
every
respect
test
no
is
the
eye
test
this
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
test
in
hypnosis
many
subjects
equate
the
inability
to
open
the
eyes
with
hypnosis
many
assume
that
if
they
can
open
their
eyes
they
have
not
been
hypnotized
i
must
emphatically
point
out
that
this
is
not
true
the
subject
can
fail
the
eye
test
and
yet
have
been
under
hypnosis
in
the
deep
somnambulistic
state
the
subject
can
open
his
eyes
without
affecting
the
depth
of
the
hypnotic
state
in
fact
this
is
done
many
times
in
getting
the
subject
to
do
automatic
writing
crystal
gazing
mirror
gazing
hypnodrama
and
revivification
in
carrying
out
posthypnotic
suggestions
in
any
state
the
subject
is
frequently
told
that
he
will
open
his
eyes
and
carry
out
the
suggestion
i
have
found
that
there
is
more
anxiety
connected
with
the
eye
test
than
with
any
other
test
i
feel
that
it
is
a
normal
reaction
and
one
that
must
be
anticipated
by
the
hypnotist
as
well
as
the
subject
occasionally
while
hypnotizing
a
new
subject
he
will
open
his
eyes
this
can
happen
when
the
subject
feels
he
is
losing
consciousness
his
ability
to
open
his
eyes
proves
to
him
that
he
is
in
control
one
of
the
main
fears
that
the
subject
has
is
his
belief
that
he
will
lose
voluntary
control
of
himself
the
fact
that
he
can
open
his
eyes
lessens
his
anxiety
if
there
seems
to
be
too
much
threat
to
the
individual
i
use
a
method
that
you
can
follow
instead
of
suggesting
that
the
subject
will
be
unable
to
open
his
eyes
at
a
specific
count
i
suggest
that
he
will
be
so
relaxed
that
it
will
be
too
much
effort
to
open
his
eyes
until
a
further
count
is
given
actually
what
could
take
less
effort
here
are
suggestions
you
can
use
as
i
count
to
three
i
shall
try
to
open
my
eyes
but
i
shall
be
unable
to
do
so
because
i
feel
so
relaxed
it
will
just
take
too
much
effort
to
open
my
eyes
until
i
reach
the
count
of
five
or
tell
myself
to
awaken
one
my
eyes
are
closed
and
i
am
in
a
very
deep
state
of
hypnosis
two
my
eyelids
are
stuck
tightly
together
three
it
is
now
impossible
for
me
to
open
my
eyes
i
shall
be
able
to
open
them
though
at
the
count
of
five
four
i
shall
be
able
to
open
my
eyes
very
easily
at
the
count
of
five
five
i
can
now
open
my
eyes
and
wake
up
feeling
alert
and
fully
refreshed
in
accomplishing
the
eye
test
you
try
to
create
a
vivid
picture
of
yourself
being
completely
and
fully
relaxed
if
you
really
exerted
a
great
deal
of
effort
you
could
open
your
eyes
but
because
of
the
pleasantness
of
the
completely
relaxed
state
you
prefer
not
to
do
so
it
can
be
likened
to
your
enduring
the
cold
winter
air
when
you
are
half
asleep
in
bed
instead
of
getting
up
to
close
the
window
which
has
been
left
open
too
much
you
can
of
course
get
up
and
close
the
window
but
it
becomes
a
matter
of
expending
too
much
energy
instead
you
choose
to
endure
the
discomfort
or
suggest
that
your
spouse
close
the
window
for
the
following
three
tests
you
give
yourself
the
suggestions
as
outlined
in
the
previous
tests
it
should
be
pointed
out
again
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
test
you
give
yourself
a
suggestion
that
you
will
feel
normal
in
every
respect
test
no
is
the
music
test
this
test
involves
creating
an
auditory
hallucination
give
yourself
the
suggestion
that
at
a
specific
count
you
will
hear
your
favorite
song
it
will
last
for
one
minute
and
then
fade
out
test
no
is
the
dream
test
it
is
incorporated
in
a
great
deal
of
hypnotherapy
the
subject
is
told
that
as
the
hypnotist
counts
to
three
the
subject
will
have
a
dream
lasting
for
several
minutes
which
he
will
remember
this
dream
furthermore
will
call
his
attention
to
an
important
incident
that
he
has
long
forgotten
yet
which
will
be
relevant
to
his
problem
in
you
suggest
to
yourself
that
at
a
specific
count
you
will
have
a
very
pleasant
dream
lasting
for
several
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
you
will
awaken
feeling
refreshed
for
those
readers
further
interested
in
producing
dreams
i
can
highly
recommend
a
very
fascinating
book
called
experimental
production
of
dreams

by
professor
david

no
is
the
anesthesia
test
this
is
conducted
by
telling
yourself
that
you
will
not
feel
the
pain
associated
with
the
act
of
pinching
yourself
you
suggest
that
you
will
feel
the
pressure
of
your
fingers
but
will
not
feel
the
pain
involved
urge
the
reader
not
to
stick
pins
in
himself
to
test
the
anesthesia
this
can
be
dangerous
lead
to
infection
and
cause
other
harmful
you
should
also
not
dig
your
nails
into
your
skin
to
make
sure
that
you
do
feel
pain
chapter
a
new
approach
to
when
all
else
fails
let
us
assume
that
you
have
tried
diligently
to
learn
for
a
month
or
more
but
have
failed
you
have
worked
faithfully
following
the
instructions
outlined
in
this
book
and
other
books
on
but
somehow
the
state
of
hypnosis
eludes
you
should
you
give
up
in
despair
or
is
there
still
hope
for
you
let
me
assure
you
that
you
can
still
become
an
excellent
subject
let
us
examine
several
areas
of
this
problem
and
a
new
approach
that
will
help
you
achieve
your
ends
you
must
first
of
all
ask
yourself
if
you
are
feeling
better
and
whether
you
have
made
strides
in
the
direction
you
desire
while
giving
yourself
suggestions
in
whatever
stage
of
hypnosis
you
have
achieved
if
your
evaluation
is
affirmative
to
any
degree
you
can
expect
even
greater
results
but
you
may
say
how
can
i
expect
greater
results
when
i
have
achieved
my
answer
is
you
may
be
achieving
and
not
know
it
the
change
to
the
state
from
the
waking
state
can
be
imperceptible
many
times
prior
to
testing
subjects
under
hypnosis
i
ask
them
if
they
think
they
are
in
the
hypnotic
state
the
answer
is
invariably
no
when
asking
the
subjects
for
a
cogent
reason
for
this
answer
they
usually
exclaim
that
they
are
aware
of
what
is
going
on
and
do
not
feel
any
different
than
they
did
before
i
started
working
with
them
they
are
amazed
to
find
that
various
tests
work
so
perfectly
some
subjects
do
not
respond
to
hypnotic
tests
no
matter
how
long
you
work
with
them
for
these
persons
i
usually
the
need
for
passing
the
tests
and
concentrate
on
the
therapeutic
results
which
are
desired
this
approach
lessens
anxiety
and
usually
results
in
a
deepening
of
the
hypnotic
state
it
is
my
feeling
that
many
subjects
resist
any
tests
as
the
implication
is
that
once
the
tests
work
the
subject
is
under
complete
control
of
the
hypnotist
the
subject
may
fear
this
supposed
subjection
on
one
hand
and
yet
want
it
on
the
other
hand
these
forces
can
work
unconsciously
and
thus
the
attainment
of
hypnosis
becomes
a
very
intricate
perplexing
and
trying
procedure
even
though
this
may
be
so
i
can
assure
you
that
the
problem
and
attainment
of
hypnosis
can
be
resolved
it
is
only
a
matter
of
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
subject
this
is
the
main
ingredient
necessary
for
successful
hypnosis
let
me
now
explain
a
technique
which
has
worked
admirably
for
many
who
have
been
frustrated
because
of
their
inability
to
achieve
it
involves
you
are
and
going
through
the
motions
of
the
various
tests
though
you
were
a
perfect
you
will
recall
that
one
theory
of
hypnosis
is
that
the
subject
behaves
in
a
manner
that
he
believes
is
in
keeping
with
hypnotic
behavior
this
role
playing
is
the
basis
for
our
unique
approach
as
the
subject
continues
this
procedure
he
takes
on
the
conditioned
response
mechanism
necessary
for
let
us
look
at
the
following
examples
of
role
playing
during
the
war
many
soldiers
who
wanted
to
leave
the
army
would
pretend
something
was
wrong
with
them
they
would
convince
the
authorities
of
the
authenticity
of
their
illness
and
since
nothing
seemed
to
make
them
better
they
eventually
were
separated
from
the
service
because
of
the
incapacitating
disorder
but
what
happened
to
many
of
these
malingerers
after
they
were
released
from
the
service
i
sure
you
know
the
rest
of
the
story
the
constant
malingering
was
transformed
by
this
role
playing
into
a
conditioned
response
pattern
eventually
bringing
about
the
very
undesirable
condition
responsible
for
their
leaving
the
service
i
saw
some
of
these
individuals
and
more
than
once
they
told
me
that
they
had
unwittingly
hypnotized
themselves
into
having
the
ailment
they
wanted
me
to
dehypnotize
them
they
actually
turned
out
to
be
very
easy
subjects
as
they
had
become
highly
suggestible
unfortunately
their
structure
was
weak
they
had
difficulty
in
identifying
strongly
with
anyone
and
the
relationship
in
hypnosis
was
superficial
and
without
depth
i
am
going
to
relate
another
example
which
i
hope
will
help
you
understand
the
technique
for
i
have
had
the
following
experience
many
times
in
giving
hypnotic
demonstrations
before
various
organizations
for
some
reason
even
though
i
carefully
ask
that
only
those
who
desire
to
be
hypnotized
volunteer
as
subjects
for
the
hypnotic
demonstrations
an
individual
who
has
no
intention
of
cooperating
comes
up
on
the
stage
to
poke
fun
at
the
hypnotist
in
giving
public
demonstrations
i
usually
work
with
about
ten
subjects
and
simultaneously
give
them
the
same
suggestions
and
posthypnotic
suggestions
once
the
subjects
are
hypnotized
i
work
with
them
with
their
eyes
open
using
this
technique
with
each
subject
carrying
out
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
intensifies
the
responses
of
other
subjects
there
is
also
competitiveness
to
become
the
best
subject
in
the
meantime
the
individual
who
is
really
not
under
hypnosis
has
let
the
audience
know
about
it
by
winking
or
making
a
grimace
when
i
was
not
looking
at
him
observing
laughter
and
other
audience
reactions
which
are
not
in
keeping
with
what
is
happening
at
the
precise
moment
during
my
lecture
is
my
cue
that
i
have
an
egocentric
person
on
stage
you
might
ask
ca
you
tell
when
someone
is
faking
it
is
extremely
difficult
many
times
to
do
so
once
you
are
aware
of
it
however
you
give
certain
tests
to
the
group
the
exhibitionist
does
know
how
to
respond
each
time
and
you
soon
pick
him
out
even
when
i
know
specifically
who
it
is
i
do
not
dismiss
him
interestingly
it
is
invariably
a
man
i
continue
with
the
but
i
let
the
audience
know
that
i
am
aware
of
the
situation
this
is
the
interesting
part
of
this
example
the
bumptious
subject
by
giving
himself
autosuggestions
to
comply
with
various
posthypnotic
suggestions
is
actually
engaging
in
our
technique
of
role
playing
the
inevitable
happens
he
finds
himself
hypnotized
despite
his
obvious
intention
not
to
be
affected
in
any
way
any
hypnotist
can
recount
similar
incidents
what
can
you
learn
by
the
example
just
presented
what
if
you
purposely
set
about
doing
the
same
thing
in
your
attempt
to
achieve
the
obvious
answer
is
that
the
technique
has
a
good
chance
of
working
and
as
a
result
you
will
achieve
this
method
has
worked
with
many
recalcitrant
subjects
to
follow
this
plan
go
back
to
chapter
six
how
to
attain
and
use
the
technique
you
be
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
this
approach
will
act
as
a
catalyst
remember
once
you
obtain
the
eye
closure
give
yourself
whatever
therapeutic
suggestion
you
desire
plus
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
the
next
time
you
will
fall
into
a
deeper
and
sounder
state
of
hypnosis
at
the
count
of
three
or
any
other
cue
you
desire
i
know
you
may
protest
using
the
technique
with
the
question
if
i
not
under
hypnosis
why
give
myself
therapeutic
posthypnotic
suggestions
to
condition
myself
to
go
under
hypnosis
at
a
specific
count
you
may
further
protest
that
you
are
only
fooling
yourself
my
answer
is
what
if
you
are
what
is
lost
by
doing
it
you
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
are
you
not
really
interested
in
the
end
result
and
not
the
means
the
attainment
of
the
state
is
not
in
itself
the
end
result
it
is
a
means
to
help
you
achieve
your
goal
do
many
people
carry
or
wear
charms
of
a
religious
or
nonreligious
nature
do
we
accept
these
items
in
our
society
the
clover
and
rabbit
foot
as
symbols
of
good
luck
have
been
part
of
our
culture
for
a
long
time
we
are
all
sophisticated
enough
to
know
that
they
do
not
have
an
intrinsic
value
but
do
they
do
something
for
our
mental
attitude
this
same
pattern
is
precisely
what
you
are
to
follow
in
using
the
technique
if
you
believe
expect
and
imagine
that
you
will
be
successful
in
this
approach
to
i
can
assure
you
that
you
will
may
i
urge
you
not
to
reject
this
novel
and
unorthodox
approach
many
have
had
excellent
results
when
other
methods
even
those
of
a
professional
hypnotist
have
failed
some
of
you
may
recognize
this
approach
as
another
means
of
applying
the
technique
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
i
reiterate
you
can
expect
good
results
it
is
only
necessary
that
you
follow
the
instructions
and
adopt
the
right
attitude
by
the
right
attitude
i
mean
that
you
should
adopt
the
conviction
that
you
are
going
to
achieve
even
though
you
might
have
experienced
difficulty
up
to
now
hypnosis
is
a
conviction
phenomenon
it
is
possible
you
may
say
you
are
not
suggestible
actually
your
lack
of
response
proves
your
suggestibility
you
have
been
influenced
by
negative
suggestions
everyone
is
suggestible
to
some
degree
you
have
become
extremely
suggestible
to
conscious
or
unconscious
stimuli
which
are
definitely
affecting
your
ability
to
respond
you
need
only
use
this
latent
suggestibility
and
make
it
work
for
you
what
would
you
say
about
the
suggestibility
of
a
person
who
does
want
to
talk
about
hypnosis
this
person
has
never
read
a
book
on
hypnosis
and
absolutely
want
you
or
anyone
else
to
hypnotize
him
would
you
believe
this
person
is
a
potentially
good
hypnotic
subject
i
can
tell
you
by
practical
experience
that
once
this
person
allows
himself
to
be
hypnotized
he
turns
out
to
be
a
perfect
subject
responding
to
either
end
of
the
suggestibility
scale
is
indicative
of
success
with
hypnosis
it
becomes
a
matter
of
manipulating
this
suggestibility
skillfully
in
order
to
achieve
results
let
me
give
you
another
example
which
may
help
which
one
of
the
two
lines
drawn
on
this
page
is
longer
line
ab
or
line
cd
illustration
what
is
your
answer
did
you
think
both
were
the
same
take
a
ruler
and
actually
measure
them
you
find
line
ab
longer
than
cd
but
you
reply
every
other
time
both
lines
were
the
same
this
is
a
familiar
optical
illusion
which
is
used
many
times
in
basic
courses
in
psychology
it
is
known
as
the
illusion
my
contention
is
that
if
you
said
both
are
the
same
size
you
are
potentially
a
good
subject
you
respond
perfectly
to
previous
conditioning
thus
you
are
responding
as
anticipated
if
on
the
other
hand
you
picked
line
ab
you
are
normally
suggestible
if
you
honestly
picked
line
cd
you
are
extremely
cautious
and
respond
best
to
reverse
psychology
once
again
you
are
highly
suggestible
but
toward
one
extreme
illustration
illustration
here
another
interesting
experiment
would
you
say
that
lines
ab
and
cd
were
perfectly
straight
i
let
you
figure
out
what
your
response
means
to
this
test
by
yourself
you
can
take
a
ruler
to
determine
if
the
lines
are
straight
we
all
respond
unconsciously
to
stimuli
of
some
sort
word
association
tests
are
based
on
this
principle
are
your
reactions
automatic
to
the
following
terms
democratic
party
republican
party
communist
party
mother
father
movie
star
if
i
mention
the
name
of
a
famous
person
city
or
country
the
same
immediate
unconscious
reaction
takes
place
let
try
it
theodore
roosevelt
harry
truman
dwight
eisenhower
john
kennedy
albert
einstein
albert
schweitzer
eleanor
roosevelt
boston
new
york
city
hollywood
miami
beach
united
states
england
france
italy
israel
africa
russia
china
india
and
south
america
the
response
and
image
keep
changing
do
they
i
am
trying
to
point
out
that
this
reaction
is
automatic
because
of
previous
conditioning
i
could
mention
almost
anything
and
the
same
automatic
reaction
would
take
place
the
reaction
would
always
be
the
same
unless
something
had
happened
to
change
or
alter
your
response
let
us
mention
the
word
hypnosis
some
sort
of
reaction
must
take
place
this
can
either
be
positive
negative
or
neutral
for
our
purposes
you
really
do
have
to
think
about
your
response
as
it
is
automatic
the
point
to
remember
is
that
a
definite
response
has
taken
place
which
will
either
help
or
hinder
your
attainment
of
hypnosis
if
the
response
should
be
negative
it
can
be
changed
by
gaining
knowledge
and
actual
experience
in
hypnosis
it
is
natural
to
have
a
bit
of
uneasiness
when
first
experiencing
or
thinking
about
being
hypnotized
after
all
you
have
been
exposed
to
hypnosis
in
a
therapeutic
setting
and
have
formed
a
favorable
reaction
your
response
is
probably
derived
from
a
fictionization
of
hypnosis
the
initial
task
of
the
hypnotist
is
to
create
by
educating
the
prospective
subject
a
favorable
attitude
so
that
the
subject
allows
himself
to
be
hypnotized
what
does
this
mean
specifically
to
you
if
you
are
having
difficulty
learning
it
means
that
through
repeated
exposures
you
will
finally
respond
you
will
realize
there
is
no
need
for
anxiety
in
regard
to
your
response
this
inner
feeling
will
in
turn
have
a
cumulative
favorable
effect
upon
your
unconscious
which
will
result
in
your
finally
responding
to
hypnosis
suppose
you
still
maintain
and
insist
that
you
are
not
suggestible
and
wonder
if
you
will
ever
respond
to
hypnosis
furthermore
the
assurance
i
have
given
you
up
to
this
point
does
seem
to
convince
you
if
you
have
tried
diligently
to
achieve
you
can
not
be
blamed
but
let
try
an
experiment
to
test
your
suggestibility
it
is
well
to
ponder
my
statement
that
if
you
do
not
respond
it
is
a
sign
of
being
suggestible
but
in
a
negative
sense
lack
of
response
is
a
manifestation
of
this
negative
suggestibility
my
contention
is
that
you
are
definitely
suggestible
let
us
see
what
happens
to
you
in
trying
the
following
classical
experiment
it
is
called
the
chevreul
pendulum
test
draw
a
circle
with
about
a
diameter
and
mark
it
as
shown
in
the
illustration
illustration
next
take
a
ring
and
attach
a
string
to
it
if
you
have
a
locket
it
will
do
as
well
the
hypnotist
uses
a
crystal
ball
and
chain
for
this
experiment
hold
the
end
of
the
string
or
chain
and
keep
the
ring
or
whatever
object
you
are
using
about
three
inches
above
the
center
of
the
circle
now
concentrate
and
fix
your
gaze
on
the
ring
crystal
ball
or
locket
mentally
suggest
to
yourself
that
the
object
will
begin
to
revolve
in
a
circular
manner
following
the
numbers
and
picture
in
your
mind
eye
that
this
circular
motion
is
becoming
wider
and
wider
work
at
this
image
for
several
minutes
did
the
object
begin
turning
to
the
right
following
the
numbers
did
the
circle
become
larger
and
larger
if
it
did
you
are
absolutely
suggestible
are
influenced
by
your
own
suggestions
and
therefore
if
you
follow
instructions
can
learn
you
can
be
trained
to
acquire
this
skill
if
the
experience
did
not
work
try
it
again
concentrate
harder
and
try
to
visualize
more
intently
the
object
revolving
in
a
circular
manner
you
are
not
to
rotate
the
object
consciously
or
help
it
in
any
way
the
action
must
stem
from
your
subconscious
the
thought
of
the
crystal
ball
or
ring
revolving
in
a
clockwise
or
counterclockwise
direction
invariably
causes
an
involuntary
muscular
reflex
action
to
take
place
this
phenomenon
is
known
as
an
ideomotor
action
usually
as
the
subject
concentrates
more
intensely
the
reflex
action
becomes
more
profound
causing
greater
unconscious
movement
of
the
hand
which
in
turn
is
transmitted
to
the
object
in
the
form
of
larger
circles
and
greater
momentum
the
time
required
for
the
successful
accomplishment
of
this
test
depends
upon
the
degree
of
suggestibility
of
the
subject
an
interesting
action
is
to
see
the
object
revolve
in
an
opposite
direction
than
suggested
it
gives
a
clue
to
the
personality
structure
of
the
individual
the
ouija
board
works
on
the
same
principle
as
the
chevreul
pendulum
test
many
times
the
aspirant
will
remark
i
swear
i
did
make
it
move
mentalists
find
hidden
objects
in
an
audience
using
basically
the
same
approach
combined
with
clever
techniques
of
distraction
the
term
given
for
this
is
muscle
reading
this
is
the
point
in
question
if
the
crystal
ball
ring
or
locket
moves
without
conscious
direction
you
have
successfully
influenced
your
subconscious
mind
involves
the
same
procedure
the
goal
is
to
consciously
cause
a
subconscious
reaction
if
the
experiment
does
not
work
with
your
eyes
open
try
it
with
your
eyes
closed
for
about
five
minutes
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
results
should
you
want
to
prove
to
yourself
that
you
are
suggestible
with
your
eyes
open
practice
the
technique
every
day
for
a
week
or
two
the
idea
of
the
practice
sessions
is
to
reinforce
and
increase
the
response
of
the
unconscious
movement
until
you
develop
proficiency
it
follows
the
laws
of
the
conditioned
reflex
theory
expounded
by
ivan
pavlov
the
famous
russian
psychologist
if
after
several
weeks
you
should
still
not
be
successful
use
the
technique
consciously
make
the
object
revolve
after
a
while
it
will
move
automatically
whenever
you
attempt
the
experiment
when
this
happens
you
will
have
proof
of
your
suggestibility
it
is
highly
improbable
that
you
will
not
be
successful
it
would
be
a
rare
occurrence
by
the
same
systematic
efforts
i
can
assure
you
that
you
can
achieve
if
you
are
still
not
affected
favorably
you
might
consider
one
of
the
psychological
means
of
inducing
hypnosis
the
next
chapter
will
discuss
this
topic
i
would
recommend
pavlov
book
called
book
will
further
explain
and
clarify
the
concept
of
the
conditioned
response
mechanism
it
covers
necessary
conditions
for
the
development
of
conditioned
responses
their
formation
by
means
of
conditioned
and
direct
stimuli
plus
a
tremendous
amount
of
material
which
will
help
you
in
your
understanding
of
the
significance
of
the
technique
in
relationship
to
learning
chapter
psychological
aids
and
their
function
psychological
or
mechanical
aids
are
used
to
help
put
the
subject
in
a
state
of
hypnosis
the
use
of
the
aids
helps
increase
the
suggestibility
of
the
subject
toward
hypnosis
the
two
most
widely
used
hypnotic
aids
are
the
crystal
ball
and
chain
and
the
hypnodisc
one
reason
is
that
these
two
items
have
no
other
use
or
function
outside
of
the
area
of
hypnosis
therefore
when
the
hypnotist
proceeds
to
use
one
of
these
hypnotic
devices
it
must
follow
that
a
certain
mental
set
readiness
or
receptivity
must
follow
as
a
result
of
its
introduction
into
the
hypnotic
setting
if
the
subject
is
uneasy
about
the
hypnotic
setting
or
his
response
the
introduction
of
the
hypnotic
aid
can
mobilize
the
subject
defenses
which
may
be
on
a
conscious
or
unconscious
level
generally
the
mental
set
which
follows
helps
augment
whatever
hypnotic
suggestions
are
given
certainly
the
same
mental
set
would
not
follow
if
the
hypnotist
used
a
paper
clip
as
a
means
of
helping
with
the
induction
of
hypnosis
it
would
only
start
the
subject
wondering
about
the
relationship
of
the
paper
clip
to
hypnosis
it
obviously
is
in
keeping
with
what
the
subject
expects
it
is
important
to
utilize
the
subject
expectation
as
to
what
he
believes
takes
place
in
the
setting
as
long
as
this
expectation
does
not
hinder
the
induction
of
hypnosis
the
mere
act
of
turning
down
the
lights
or
drawing
the
curtains
before
the
hypnotist
begins
to
work
with
the
subject
is
a
suggestion
which
can
be
considered
as
a
psychological
aid
the
subject
knows
that
the
hypnotist
is
ready
to
begin
at
this
point
actually
it
is
necessary
to
darken
the
room
at
any
time
to
induce
hypnosis
does
the
stage
hypnotist
work
with
glaring
lights
the
room
is
darkened
and
i
might
add
that
i
use
this
procedure
myself
mainly
for
the
psychological
effect
if
i
feel
that
this
procedure
might
cause
anxiety
i
proceed
with
the
room
undarkened
in
discussing
psychological
aids
it
is
agreed
that
we
are
primarily
interested
in
seeing
the
subject
feel
better
or
achieve
whatever
goals
he
seeks
through
the
intelligent
application
of
if
a
hypnotic
aid
will
help
the
subject
achieve
hypnosis
we
can
concur
it
is
justified
it
is
not
to
be
considered
a
subterfuge
if
the
physician
administers
a
placebo
to
a
patient
with
the
remark
here
is
a
new
medication
that
can
help
your
condition
and
if
this
technique
does
help
alleviate
the
patient
condition
it
is
considered
good
medicine
you
know
beforehand
that
in
using
the
hypnodisc
the
eyes
must
begin
to
water
his
eyelids
must
get
heavy
and
eventually
he
must
close
them
even
before
you
begin
to
use
the
hypnodisc
you
suggest
that
these
conditions
will
take
place
during
the
induction
of
hypnosis
as
these
reactions
are
noted
by
the
subject
a
favorable
psychological
attitude
automatically
develops
which
in
turn
helps
further
suggestions
if
the
subject
reacts
favorably
to
suggestions
a
b
and
c
it
follows
that
he
is
more
prone
to
accept
suggestions
d
e
and
f
which
are
therapeutic
in
nature
the
subject
can
relate
better
to
the
latter
suggestions
when
he
has
seen
proof
of
his
initial
suggestibility
this
approach
works
better
than
beginning
immediately
with
the
latter
suggestions
the
of
suggestions
convinces
the
subject
he
is
in
a
heightened
state
of
suggestibility
and
can
benefit
from
the
therapeutic
suggestions
of
the
hypnotist
or
his
own
perhaps
this
needed
assurance
is
so
helpful
because
it
eliminates
the
anxiety
of
the
subject
concerning
his
suggestibility
he
seeks
and
needs
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
he
has
attained
the
prerequisites
necessary
before
any
therapeutic
program
can
benefit
him
the
subject
prerequisites
need
not
be
actually
related
to
the
hypnotic
process
per
se
but
merely
match
his
preconceived
ideas
about
what
is
necessary
let
me
give
you
an
example
many
subjects
feel
that
they
must
experience
amnesia
before
they
can
benefit
from
hypnotic
suggestions
this
premise
is
inaccurate
since
favorable
and
lasting
results
can
be
achieved
in
any
degree
of
hypnosis
depending
of
course
on
the
nature
of
the
problem
let
me
relate
several
interesting
occurrences
that
take
place
every
so
often
in
my
own
practice
as
a
professional
hypnotist
a
subject
who
is
responding
well
to
hypnosis
but
not
to
the
point
of
amnesia
insists
that
he
will
not
benefit
until
he
is
knocked
out
and
does
remember
what
happened
trying
to
convince
him
otherwise
proves
fatal
he
just
refuses
to
accept
whatever
explanation
you
give
him
my
own
method
is
not
to
insist
that
the
subject
is
wrong
but
somehow
to
use
his
misconception
in
a
constructive
manner
after
getting
him
into
a
cataleptic
state
i
suggest
that
i
am
going
to
stop
talking
for
five
minutes
during
which
time
he
is
to
mentally
repeat
sleep
as
he
slowly
and
deeply
inhales
and
deep
sleep
as
he
slowly
exhales
at
the
end
of
this
time
he
be
in
a
very
deep
hypnotic
state
instead
of
remaining
quiet
for
five
minutes
i
take
ten
minutes
i
then
begin
to
whisper
suggestions
to
the
subject
to
determine
if
he
is
still
under
hypnosis
or
asleep
if
he
is
asleep
i
let
him
remain
asleep
for
a
still
longer
period
of
time
after
which
interval
i
awaken
him
i
ask
him
if
he
remembers
what
i
said
to
him
during
the
time
he
was
deeply
hypnotized
if
he
says
no
i
remark
very
good
i
further
point
out
to
him
that
he
has
now
experienced
amnesia
and
will
now
make
rapid
strides
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
is
pleased
to
see
that
i
now
agree
with
him
and
in
fact
the
interesting
result
is
that
he
does
make
excellent
progress
because
his
preconceived
requirements
have
been
met
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
i
keep
working
with
the
subject
until
such
time
that
he
falls
asleep
the
transition
from
hypnosis
to
sleep
is
normal
it
is
easy
for
the
subject
to
fall
asleep
because
he
is
so
relaxed
let
me
tell
you
of
a
similar
experience
before
telling
you
of
this
psychological
technique
it
is
only
fair
to
point
out
that
the
professional
hypnotist
varies
his
approach
from
subject
to
subject
not
only
to
suit
the
needs
of
the
subject
but
to
break
the
monotony
of
using
only
a
few
successful
procedures
his
experimentation
helps
develop
not
only
new
procedures
but
new
concepts
relative
to
the
general
nature
of
hypnosis
and
its
many
ramifications
i
was
interested
to
see
what
would
happen
to
a
subject
if
he
thought
he
was
deeply
hypnotized
without
ever
giving
him
verbal
suggestions
or
reassurance
that
he
would
feel
better
or
overcome
his
problem
of
course
if
the
technique
did
not
work
quickly
i
would
drop
the
procedure
for
a
more
orthodox
approach
instead
of
trying
to
really
hypnotize
the
subject
my
aim
is
to
get
him
to
sleep
once
he
is
asleep
i
let
him
remain
so
for
about
minutes
without
having
ever
given
him
a
therapeutic
suggestion
i
awaken
him
and
inquire
if
he
remembered
what
happened
if
the
answer
is
no
i
tell
him
i
hypnotize
him
again
next
week
and
this
concludes
the
visit
when
he
returns
next
week
i
ask
him
how
did
you
feel
during
the
week
the
answer
is
generally
much
better
i
keep
repeating
this
procedure
until
such
time
that
the
individual
has
attained
the
goals
that
he
seeks
i
know
that
the
reader
may
be
surprised
that
i
would
divulge
such
an
unconventional
procedure
the
principle
is
the
same
as
the
physician
using
a
placebo
i
do
so
to
illustrate
the
point
that
i
made
earlier
in
this
chapter
that
so
long
as
certain
of
the
subject
requirements
are
met
whether
valid
or
invalid
the
subject
suggestibility
is
greatly
enhanced
naturally
the
unsuspecting
subject
equated
the
period
of
not
remembering
which
was
as
we
know
true
sleep
with
the
somnambulistic
state
actually
he
was
helped
by
because
he
felt
he
would
now
make
progress
because
he
proved
to
be
such
an
excellent
subject
it
is
true
he
was
not
using
as
has
been
outlined
in
this
book
but
he
had
now
achieved
a
heightened
state
of
suggestibility
hypnosis
and
was
using
this
state
to
further
his
own
ends
the
attainment
of
can
be
an
intricate
and
elusive
procedure
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
the
purpose
of
the
entire
book
is
to
instruct
point
out
and
give
you
the
necessary
understanding
and
knowledge
required
to
achieve
this
end
without
this
understanding
this
can
become
a
very
frustrating
effort
it
is
hoped
that
by
understanding
and
being
aware
of
some
of
the
ramifications
of
hypnosis
you
will
be
able
to
achieve
your
goal
in
the
quickest
possible
time
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
no
two
subjects
react
in
the
same
way
and
that
different
methods
and
requirements
are
necessary
to
suit
the
individual
it
is
a
mistake
to
try
to
make
the
subject
adhere
to
a
rigid
methodology
the
greater
flexibility
of
the
hypnotic
procedures
the
greater
the
chance
for
success
let
me
at
this
time
further
discuss
some
of
the
hypnotic
aids
that
are
used
in
the
induction
of
hypnosis
we
have
already
discussed
the
use
of
the
hypnodisc
and
crystal
ball
and
chain
the
same
principles
are
involved
in
any
other
object
which
is
used
as
a
means
of
fixation
or
of
tiring
the
eyes
hypnotic
phonograph
records
and
hypnotic
tape
recordings
represent
new
devices
that
have
been
instrumental
in
conditioning
subjects
for
the
subject
plays
the
record
or
tape
on
his
phonograph
or
tape
recorder
and
is
conditioned
over
a
period
of
time
to
respond
to
hypnosis
at
a
given
signal
or
phrase
he
in
turn
can
change
this
key
phrase
to
one
of
his
own
choosing
should
you
own
or
have
access
to
a
tape
recorder
i
would
suggest
recording
an
induction
of
hypnosis
and
playing
it
back
to
yourself
in
this
manner
as
though
you
were
hypnotizing
someone
else
i
have
produced
three
different
hypnotic
records
and
a
hypnotic
tape
containing
the
three
records
which
are
sold
commercially
one
record
called
the
musical
hypnotic
record
has
a
very
pleasant
relaxing
musical
background
as
the
voice
of
the
hypnotist
induces
hypnosis
the
second
record
called
the
metronome
hypnotic
record
incorporates
the
monotonous
and
lulling
beat
of
an
electric
metronome
in
the
background
the
subject
is
instructed
to
mentally
repeat
sleep
as
he
slowly
inhales
and
deep
sleep
as
he
slowly
exhales
in
rhythm
with
the
beat
of
the
metronome
while
the
subject
is
concentrating
on
this
activity
the
voice
of
the
hypnotist
induces
hypnosis
the
third
record
called
record
no
contains
only
the
voice
of
the
hypnotist
inducing
hypnosis
it
features
a
unique
approach
and
technique
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
with
those
who
have
used
these
phonograph
records
and
the
hypnotic
tape
for
conditioning
themselves
for
the
results
are
quite
interesting
and
run
the
range
of
immediate
results
to
no
results
one
person
wrote
that
one
of
the
records
hypnotized
him
at
the
first
playing
and
conditioned
him
for
whereas
he
had
failed
to
respond
to
hypnosis
after
many
visits
to
one
of
the
country
foremost
authorities
i
have
had
similar
experiences
after
having
failed
to
hypnotize
a
subject
despite
many
attempts
i
can
only
speculate
that
the
subjects
in
these
cases
unconsciously
resist
the
hypnotist
because
they
feel
a
personal
threat
since
the
record
is
impersonal
they
are
better
able
to
relax
and
subsequently
be
hypnotized
interestingly
this
occurred
when
the
subject
was
convinced
that
he
was
a
very
difficult
subject
it
would
seem
that
only
then
was
the
conditioned
response
pattern
finally
established
the
basic
function
of
the
hypnotic
records
and
hypnotic
tape
is
to
establish
a
conditioned
response
pattern
to
a
given
stimulus
in
time
most
subjects
are
conditioned
by
the
intelligent
and
systematic
use
of
these
recordings
let
me
describe
another
varied
approach
to
achieving
one
of
the
chief
assets
of
a
good
hypnotist
is
to
be
flexible
in
his
approach
in
hypnotizing
his
subjects
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
it
is
necessary
many
times
to
adopt
a
technique
that
is
suitable
to
the
subject
and
not
to
make
the
subject
adapt
himself
to
the
method
of
induction
we
know
that
with
somnambulistic
subjects
any
procedure
will
put
the
subject
under
hypnosis
immediately
the
hypnotist
gains
complete
control
of
his
subject
as
the
subject
is
able
to
put
himself
in
the
proper
psychological
frame
of
mind
for
hypnosis
unfortunately
most
subjects
do
not
respond
at
the
first
session
or
sessions
because
of
conscious
or
subconscious
fears
that
must
be
gradually
eliminated
once
you
get
the
subject
to
relax
or
let
go
he
will
naturally
succumb
to
hypnosis
this
is
the
problem
that
confronts
all
hypnotists
merely
suggesting
to
the
subject
to
relax
is
not
sufficient
as
a
rule
to
bring
about
this
desired
mental
state
the
subject
at
this
point
can
not
easily
turn
on
or
off
his
mental
and
physical
feelings
even
if
we
have
the
subject
lie
down
this
does
not
assure
the
hypnotic
state
as
the
subject
can
still
be
tense
our
main
problem
is
to
get
the
subject
relaxed
our
situation
is
similar
to
the
physician
telling
his
patient
to
go
home
and
forget
about
a
certain
problem
i
sure
you
agree
that
the
advice
is
virtually
impossible
to
follow
one
of
the
major
stumbling
blocks
in
hypnotizing
a
subject
or
in
lies
in
the
fact
that
although
we
use
terms
such
as
relax
let
yourself
go
and
others
the
subject
can
not
readily
put
the
meaning
of
these
words
into
effect
it
is
difficult
for
most
people
to
let
go
when
we
live
in
a
society
that
beckons
us
to
look
sharp
be
sharp
be
alert
be
on
the
ball
and
make
every
minute
count
emphasis
on
productivity
does
not
lend
to
a
society
of
relaxed
individuals
in
my
long
experience
as
a
professional
hypnotist
i
have
tried
many
novel
innovations
for
inducing
hypnosis
and
teaching
individuals
some
have
met
with
a
great
deal
of
success
and
others
have
failed
it
is
furthermore
difficult
to
determine
the
causal
factors
for
success
or
failure
we
can
only
theorize
i
have
used
the
following
unorthodox
technique
for
about
a
period
of
years
exceptionally
good
results
have
been
attained
with
it
although
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
infallible
it
is
suggested
to
you
as
another
good
technique
in
order
to
help
the
subject
relax
i
have
been
using
a
phonograph
record
or
tape
that
i
recorded
containing
the
continuous
sound
of
various
degrees
of
rain
one
side
has
a
half
hour
of
very
soft
light
rainfall
such
as
you
have
experienced
in
listening
to
rain
falling
on
grass
canvas
or
a
tent
top
the
other
side
or
track
contains
a
half
hour
of
rain
effects
such
as
one
would
hear
in
a
heavy
downfall
with
loud
splatterings
of
water
on
the
pavement
the
record
and
tape
were
originally
designed
to
help
insomnia
sufferers
and
later
incorporated
into
the
hypnotic
procedure
the
subject
is
instructed
to
close
his
eyes
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
rain
while
picturing
himself
relaxing
near
a
warm
glowing
fireplace
as
you
can
note
the
subject
again
incorporates
the
technique
the
relaxing
effect
thus
produced
over
a
period
of
time
enhances
his
chances
of
success
in
attaining
a
deep
hypnotic
state
there
are
many
other
interesting
and
unique
devices
and
aids
you
can
use
for
inducing
hypnosis
rather
than
present
them
all
in
this
book
i
have
fully
described
them
and
their
technique
of
operation
in
a
illustrated
catalog
this
catalog
not
only
contains
a
list
of
hypnotic
aids
but
a
description
and

of
over

chapter
the
nature
of
hypnosis
although
the
nature
and
phenomena
of
hypnosis
are
still
incompletely
understood
there
are
a
multitude
of
theories
which
attempt
to
explain
its
mechanism
and
results
the
most
that
can
be
done
at
this
time
is
to
explore
various
views
which
are
held
by
leading
authorities
at
present
it
can
be
said
however
that
a
majority
of
authorities
agree
that
hypnosis
ensues
as
a
result
of
natural
laws
which
have
been
incorporated
in
the
human
organism
since
the
beginning
of
man
as
he
is
today
the
older
theories
show
almost
as
much
disparity
as
today
but
for
the
purposes
of
history
it
is
probably
necessary
to
enumerate
only
the
animal
magnetism
of
frederick
anton
mesmer
and
a
mention
of
the
hysteria
syndrome
of
jean
martin
charcot
both
names
loom
large
in
the
history
of
hypnosis
mesmer
an
century
physician
believed
that
hypnosis
occurred
as
a
result
of
vital
fluids
drawn
from
a
magnet
or
lodestone
and
which
drew
their
unique
qualities
from
the
sun
moon
and
stars
charcot
as
well
as
pierre
janet
and
others
was
convinced
that
hypnosis
was
a
form
of
hysteria
and
that
only
hysterics
could
be
hypnotized
the
former
mesmer
thought
further
that
metal
became
imbued
by
the
solar
qualities
and
his
system
is
also
known
as
metalogy
by
which
he
meant
the
proper
application
of
metals
naturally
these
theories
have
been
largely
abandoned
today
although
there
are
still
a
few
who
think
that
hypnosis
is
a
form
of
hysteria
some
pioneers
notably
william
kroger
a
obstetrician
and
gynecologist
who
limits
his
practice
to
hypnotherapy
believe
hypnosis
is
a
conviction
phenomenon
which
produces
results
that
parallel
the
phenomena
produced
at
lourdes
and
other
religious
healing
shrines
his
formula
is
that
faith
hope
belief
and
expectation
all
catalyzed
by
the
imagination
lead
inevitably
to
hypnosis
he
like
emile
coué
before
him
is
convinced
that
you
can
not
will
yourself
to
be
hypnotized
and
that
whenever
the
will
and
the
imagination
come
into
conflict
the
imagination
wins
out
this
fits
in
perfectly
of
course
with
the
author
already
discussed
technique
which
requires
a
high
degree
of
imagination
kroger
like
a
few
others
has
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
all
hypnotic
phenomena
can
be
produced
at
a
level
a
large
number
of
hypnotists
including
the
author
has
come
to
believe
that
hypnosis
is
a
semantic
problem
in
which
words
are
the
building
blocks
to
success
not
just
any
words
but
words
which
ring
a
bell
or
tap
the
experiential
background
of
the
subject
this
is
why
sleep
continues
to
be
in
the
lexicon
of
the
hypnotist
even
though
hypnosis
is
the
antithesis
of
sleep
the
word
is
used
because
hypnosis
superficially
resembles
sleep
inasmuch
as
the
eyes
usually
are
closed
the
body
in
a
posture
of
complete
relaxation
actually
the
mind
is
hyperacute
pavlov
however
believed
that
there
was
an
analogy
between
sleep
and
hypnosis
in
that
each
involved
cerebral
inhibition
words
of
course
would
be
of
little
use
without
the
added
effect
of
his
conditioned
reflexology
probably
the
most
widely
held
theory
is
that
hypnosis
is
a
transference
phenomenon
in
which
the
prestige
of
the
hypnotist
and
his
relationship
to
the
subject
plays
an
important
role
this
theory
is
bolstered
by
the
fact
that
all
schools
of
psychotherapy
yield
approximately
the
same
results
even
though
the
methods
differ
this
would
logically
indicate
that
the
relationship
between
the
therapist
and
the
subject
was
the
determining
factor
the
only
trouble
with
this
theory
is
that
it
does
not
explain
on
the
other
hand
we
know
that
a
strong
interpersonal
relationship
is
necessary
for
hypnosis
in
the
opening
chapter
of
the
book
i
explained
that
hypnosis
was
a
state
of
heightened
suggestion
in
which
the
subject
adopted
an
uncritical
attitude
allowing
him
to
accept
suggestions
and
to
take
appropriate
action
this
is
excellent
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
does
not
explain
how
suggestion
works
this
is
the
crux
of
the
hypnotic
dilemma
and
the
answer
is
far
from
solved
hypnotists
are
much
like
those
who
use
electricity
every
day
of
their
lives
but
have
no
idea
of
the
nature
of
electricity
it
is
enough
for
them
to
know
it
has
been
harnessed
for
their
use
if
there
is
one
thing
virtually
certain
about
hypnosis
it
is
that
some
parts
of
the
brain
are
inhibited
and
other
parts
expanded
by
the
process
concentration
is
given
as
the
reason
for
this
selective
procedure
which
narrows
the
horizon
of
the
subject
to
what
the
hypnotist
or
he
himself
is
saying
screening
out
all
other
stimuli
but
why
is
this
high
order
of
concentration
so
easy
under
hypnosis
when
asians
notably
the
chinese
have
been
trying
for
centuries
to
concentrate
on
one
subject
for
as
long
as
four
or
five
seconds
we
do
not
know
the
mechanics
of
this
metamorphosis
of
an
ordinary
brain
into
an
organ
of
concentrated
power
according
to
janet
this
is
accomplished
through
the
formation
of
a
group
of
unconscious
memories
and
activities
which
takes
over
the
usual
type
of
thinking
it
is
implied
that
the
process
may
be
atavistic
one
of
the
newer
theories
one
held
by
lewis
wolberg
a
psychoanalyst
is
that
hypnosis
is
a
psychosomatic
process
in
that
it
is
both
physiological
and
psychological
in
character
physiologically
wolberg
believes
that
hypnosis
represents
an
inhibition
of
the
higher
cortical
centers
and
a
limitation
of
sensory
channels
such
as
takes
place
in
sleep
he
also
believes
that
the
psychological
process
operates
through
transference
others
agree
that
it
is
a
transference
process
but
that
it
is
more
of
an
extension
of
the
subject
own
psychic
processes
which
is
enlarged
to
include
the
voice
of
the
hypnotist
or
his
own
thoughts
or
voice
incidentally
an
excellent
book
along
these
theoretical
lines
is
an
objective
study
in
by
andré
weitzenhoffer
the
newest
theory
in
the
field
is
of
particular
interest
to
those
reading
this
book
inasmuch
as
it
postulates
that
all
hypnosis
is
that
the
patient
always
hypnotizes
himself
and
that
it
is
a
wise
hypnotist
who
knows
who
is
hypnotizing
whom
this
is
a
logical
conclusion
and
it
disperses
any
ideas
that
hypnotic
patients
become
dependent
on
their
therapists
actually
hypnotists
today
always
teach
their
subjects
so
that
any
chance
of
dependency
is
obviated
milton
kline
professor
of
psychology
at
long
island
university
postulates
that
hypnosis
is
primarily
retrogressive
he
has
written
that
the
organism
functions
differently
on
various
levels
of
behavior
regression
and
that
the
behavior
breaks
down
into
component
parts
the
theory
that
regression
can
spotlight
personality
disorders
found
in
more
infantile
states
is
also
widely
held
he
also
is
a
proponent
of
the
idea
that
hypnosis
is
an
abnormal
manifestation
of
a
normal
process
an
opinion
he
shares
with
many
kline
thinks
that
retrogression
and
regression
alter
perceptions
and
feelings
and
in
the
case
of
the
latter
causes
us
to
go
backward
in
time
to
the
point
where
may
be
employed
this
is
a
legitimate
use
of
regression
although
it
is
not
used
so
much
these
days
to
uncover
past
traumatic
incidents
actually
regression
by
duplicating
the
exact
earlier
age
manner
of
speech
and
thought
makes
us
once
more
as
little
children
a
condition
to
be
desired
for
certain
forms
of
therapy
an
atavistic
theory
held
to
some
extent
by
jerome
schneck
clinical
associate
professor
of
psychiatry
state
university
of
new
york
college
of
medicine
is
that
hypnosis
should
be
equated
with
states
of
immobilization
on
the
basis
of
his
observation
that
some
subjects
equate
hypnosis
with
death
he
suggests
this
is
comparable
to
the
of
animals
to
avoid
danger
others
primarily
europeans
have
pointed
out
the
analogy
between
the
hypnotic
state
of
animals
and
man
another
theory
is
that
hypnosis
is
a
state
of
dissociation
meaning
that
it
constitutes
a
group
of
unconscious
memories
and
activities
which
may
be
dredged
up
to
replace
the
stream
of
consciousness
automaticism
of
course
is
inherently
part
of
this
view
and
is
presumed
to
negate
volition
activity
of
the
cerebrum
which
controls
the
conscious
and
voluntary
system
is
rendered
my
own
thoughts
on
the
matter
are
that
hypnosis
results
from
first
of
all
a
good
transference
secondly
from
a
conditioned
reflex
thirdly
from
the
person
acting
as
a
hypnotized
person
role
playing
and
fourthly
from
a
suspension
of
the
critical
faculties
along
the
line
i
believe
that
hypnotic
suggestions
have
an
autonomy
of
their
own
which
supersede
all
else
in
the
hypnotic
situation
there
are
many
more
theories
i
believe
are
partially
correct
but
the
ones
named
will
do
for
the
purposes
of
this
volume
incidentally
all
the
hypnosis
theories
presented
are
equally
applicable
to
except
where
as
in
transference
it
is
obvious
a
therapist
is
needed
in
conclusion
the
author
would
like
to
take
issue
with
those
who
believe
that
it
is
the
monotonous
intonations
of
the
therapist
that
cause
the
subject
to
lapse
from
the
deeply
relaxed
state
into
true
sleep
i
have
observed
many
times
by
comparing
verbalization
with
silence
that
the
former
gives
the
subject
mind
a
focal
point
of
attention
which
prevents
him
from
entering
a
sleep
state
where
hypnotherapy
is
impossible
like
the
man
who
can
not
sleep
because
of
an
active
mind
sleep
and
myriad
thoughts
and
suggestions
are
incompatible
and
i
believe
once
a
hypnotic
state
has
been
attained
that
the
subject
is
kept
awake
unless
definite
sleep
suggestions
are
given
by
the
therapist
series
of
suggestions
we
have
discussed
the
effect
of
the
experiential
background
at
length
and
surely
nothing
connotates
sleep
more
than
closing
one
eyes
test
no
and
so
in
my
view
you
are
doing
two
things
when
you
talk
to
the
subject
you
are
giving
him
helpful
suggestions
but
you
are
also
keeping
him
awake
and
hyperacute
so
that
these
suggestions
will
sink
in
chapter
practical
applications
of
with
hypnosis
on
the
march
there
is
practically
no
limit
to
its
uses
in
the
field
of
medicine
and
new
applications
are
being
discovered
every
day
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
add
however
that
some
of
these
uses
should
remain
as
they
are
in
the
hands
of
professionals
with
years
of
experience
in
the
area
one
of
the
themes
of
this
book
has
been
that
laymen
should
use
hypnosis
discriminately
and
intelligently
no
responsible
therapist
would
ever
recommend
masking
or
removing
a
symptom
which
was
indicative
of
organic
disease
for
that
reason
the
practical
uses
of
will
be
limited
to
measures
that
can
be
taken
safely
by
the
layman
the
only
possible
exception
to
this
will
be
instructions
on
how
to
curb
obesity
but
even
here
it
is
suggested
that
a
physician
be
consulted
before
embarking
on
a
program
the
foremost
use
of
hypnosis
has
been
for
relaxation
and
it
becomes
more
and
more
important
as
world
tensions
anxiety
and
strain
increase
daily
and
millions
seek
vainly
to
get
away
from
it
all
inasmuch
as
all
methods
of
hypnosis
discussed
in
this
book
utilized
relaxation
as
the
first
step
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
go
over
this
material
simply
review
the
many
induction
techniques
lung
cancer
has
become
a
very
real
threat
to
many
people
today
and
the
professional
hypnotist
is
besieged
with
men
and
women
who
wish
to
curtail
or
quit
smoking
this
is
easier
said
than
done
because
smoking
although
there
are
no
physical
withdrawal
symptoms
when
one
stops
is
a
strong
conditioned
reflex
and
can
not
except
in
rare
instances
be
accomplished
by
the
will
alone
the
best
way
to
stop
smoking
is
to
make
it
an
impossibility
and
that
is
exactly
what
you
do
when
you
follow
the
method
touched
on
in
an
earlier
chapter
all
of
us
have
tasted
or
smelled
certain
foods
or
medicines
that
nauseate
us
the
subject
who
wishes
to
quit
smoking
is
asked
to
conjure
up
the
vision
and
the
actual
taste
and
smell
of
the
substances
which
upset
his
stomach
and
offend
his
nostrils
transferring
its
properties
to
cigarettes
this
of
course
must
be
done
under
hypnosis
the
subject
then
conditions
himself
in
the
following
manner
one
this
cigarette
tastes
and
smells
just
like
mention
name
of
repugnant
substance
two
it
is
the
most
vile
and
repugnant
taste
i
have
ever
encountered
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
continue
after
the
third
puff
at
the
third
puff
i
will
develop
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
three
i
can
not
smoke
the
cigarette
any
longer
and
i
will
have
to
put
it
out
this
sounds
like
a
simple
procedure
and
yet
it
has
worked
for
thousands
some
switch
to
chewing
gum
or
candy
but
the
cure
essentially
lies
in
substituting
one
conditioned
reflex
for
another
this
is
comparatively
easy
with
hypnosis
because
unlike
narcotics
barbiturates
or
alcohol
smoking
is
purely
a
psychological
addiction
there
is
no
need
for
tapering
off
stopping
drinking
unlike
smoking
does
involve
merely
the
creation
of
a
physical
aversion
to
the
drug
the
patient
entire
personality
should
be
changed
and
more
mature
viewpoints
substituted
for
the
unrealistic
and
infantile
viewpoints
which
lead
to
the
addiction
in
the
first
place
the
subject
should
give
himself
suggestions
that
he
will
be
able
to
face
up
to
the
problems
of
every
day
life
without
recourse
to
the
crutch
of
alcohol
it
is
a
fact
that
nothing
is
as
bad
as
we
think
it
is
going
to
be
once
we
confront
it
one
of
the
strange
aspects
of
drinking
is
that
it
is
actually
a
form
of
and
the
cure
lies
in
substituting
a
new
viewpoint
for
the
old
this
fact
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
drinking
is
begun
in
the
first
place
so
that
the
individual
can
be
one
of
the
boys
or
because
it
is
the
thing
to
do
those
who
do
not
drink
at
least
as
a
social
lubricant
according
to
this
code
are
squares
because
of
this
must
be
directed
toward
reorienting
one
sense
of
values
sober
reflection
should
convince
anyone
that
the
truly
intelligent
person
does
not
drink
to
excess
nail
biting
is
an
unsightly
habit
one
that
may
even
hinder
one
social
acceptance
the
help
lies
in
a
therapeutic
approach
similar
to
that
for
cigarettes
it
is
not
hard
to
predict
that
many
of
those
reading
these
pages
are
suffering
from
overweight
with
million
americans
in
this
category
it
has
become
one
of
the
nation
chief
health
problems
and
it
is
the
predisposing
factor
in
many
other
diseases
such
as
heart
trouble
diabetes
hypertension
and
atherosclerosis
if
you
are
overweight
it
is
well
to
remember
that
unless
you
are
one
in
a
million
you
can
not
blame
your
glands
the
plain
truth
is
that
you
eat
too
much
we
know
today
that
overeating
for
some
is
an
emotional
problem
stemming
from
feelings
of
rejection
and
insecurity
individuals
who
feel
unloved
whether
this
is
truly
the
case
or
not
make
up
for
this
lack
to
themselves
by
stuffing
in
large
quantities
of
food
it
would
even
appear
that
these
people
are
masochistic
making
themselves
even
more
unloved
by
their
gross
gastronomical
habits
a
big
factor
in
overweight
in
women
is
raiding
the
refrigerator
while
doing
their
housework
most
of
them
do
this
so
unconsciously
that
they
swear
they
eat
less
than
most
people
there
are
a
number
of
drugs
on
the
market
today
but
they
should
not
be
necessary
for
anyone
who
has
acquired
if
you
have
learned
to
visualize
yourself
in
different
situations
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
picturing
yourself
having
a
slim
attractive
figure
exactly
as
you
were
when
you
felt
you
looked
your
best
keep
this
figure
ever
in
mind
and
use
it
along
with
conditioning
yourself
against
certain
fatty
and
starchy
foods
a
trick
used
by
some
hypnotherapists
is
to
have
the
subject
purchase
a
dress
or
suit
several
sizes
too
small
and
then
work
toward
being
able
to
wear
it
this
actually
has
worked
in
many
cases
because
it
adds
the
element
of
competitiveness
to
the
procedure
not
all
people
overeat
because
of
emotional
problems
some
come
from
families
where
licking
the
platter
clean
was
the
rule
because
food
was
scarce
others
come
from
rich
families
where
overeating
by
the
parents
established
a
habit
pattern
in
the
children
certain
races
and
nationalities
look
on
fat
as
a
badge
of
wealth
and
prestige
and
children
in
such
an
environment
are
likely
to
be
deliberately
overfed
regardless
of
the
reason
for
overweight
however
the
use
of
is
one
of
the
answers
to
the
problem
simple
headaches
arthritis
neuritis
and
other
painful
symptoms
yield
readily
to
hypnotic
suggestion
if
physicians
have
given
up
on
the
problem
and
placed
a
subject
on
a
maintenance
drug
dosage
for
pain
hypnosis
can
potentiate
the
drugs
or
even
obviate
them
two
of
the
major
uses
of
hypnosis
are
in
childbirth
and
for
intractable
pain
of
cancer
or
some
other
incurable
diseases
although
patients
usually
start
with
they
are
put
on
as
soon
as
possible
and
there
are
many
cases
of
women
waiting
too
long
and
having
their
babies
at
home
painlessly
through
the
father
invariably
is
the
only
one
excited
in
such
cases
the
mother
knows
that
she
is
an
excellent
subject
and
has
been
instructed
in
prenatal
classes
about
every
contingency
that
could
arise
inasmuch
as
stopping
the
birth
pangs
is
similar
to
stopping
other
pain
the
method
should
be
learned
so
that
it
can
be
accomplished
in
a
minimum
of
time
the
best
way
to
stop
pain
is
to
let
your
right
arm
slowly
rise
while
you
are
under
hypnotic
suggestion
do
not
help
it
if
the
suggestions
are
strong
enough
it
will
float
up
as
soon
as
the
arm
is
straight
overhead
you
should
give
yourself
the
suggestion
that
it
is
as
rigid
and
unbending
as
a
bar
of
steel
following
this
a
suggestion
is
given
that
the
hand
is
beginning
to
tingle
and
become
numb
as
soon
as
the
numbness
has
spread
through
the
entire
hand
it
will
be
insensible
to
pain
the
hand
is
then
placed
against
the
part
of
the
body
where
pain
exists
and
you
will
feel
the
numbness
flowing
from
the
hand
to
the
affected
area
this
happens
as
a
result
of
your
suggestions
and
is
the
method
followed
by
most
subjects
only
a
deep
somnambulistic
subject
is
able
to
remove
pain
by
direct
suggestion
to
the
painful
part
there
are
many
people
today
using
in
the
realm
of
sports
and
an
entire
book
has
been
written
on
improving
one
golf
game
with
this
method
it
is
called

grimm
team
physician
of
the
seattle
university
basketball
team
recently
related
the
results
when
dave
mills
a
junior
forward
asked
for
his
help
because
he
froze
during
competition
he
had
been
benched
on
the
eve
of
the
west
coast
athletic
conference
tournament
in
san
francisco
spectators
made
mills
so
fearful
that
he
was
afraid
he
would
make
mistakes
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
of
course
he
did
under
hypnosis
grimm
suggested
to
dave
that
he
would
be
unaware
of
the
spectators
be
completely
relaxed
and
would
play
exceedingly
well
grimm
asked
coach
vince
cazzeta
to
allow
dave
to
play
and
the
result
was
astounding
mills
scored
points
and
cleared
and
his
brilliant
play
led
to
his
selection
on
the
team
all
i
did
was
free
his
spirit
grimm
reported
he
was
in
need
of
confidence
and
i
gave
it
to
him
through
hypnosis
the
associated
press
told
the
story
as
follows
dave
mills
a
vacuum
cleaner
off
the
led
a
seattle
university
team
to
victory
last
night
it
was
hard
to
recognize
mills
as
the
same
player
who
has
been
with
the
chieftains
all
year
william
kroger
a
pioneer
in
hypnosis
undertook
to
improve
the
batting
of
a
professional
baseball
player
with
equally
sensational
results
the
player
had
been
beaned
and
his
fear
of
a
recurrence
was
so
strong
that
he
became
plate
shy
he
had
changed
his
batting
stance
so
that
he
always
had
one
foot
in
the
bucket
so
that
he
could
back
away
from
the
plate
more
quickly
he
was
given
a
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
such
an
event
happening
again
was
exceedingly
remote
and
this
was
amplified
by
suggestions
of
confidence
that
he
would
immediately
start
slugging
as
well
as
ever
his
batting
average
soared
immediately
michio
ikai
professor
of
physiology
at
tokyo
university
and
arthur
steinhaus
of
the
george
williams
laboratory
of
physiologic
research
in
physical
education
chicago
have
proved
that
track
men
can
far
surpass
their
best
previous
times
under
hypnosis
their
tests
incidentally
proved
that
there
is
no
danger
of
an
athlete
going
beyond
his
physiologic
limit
while
bettering
his
former
marks
they
attribute
the
superior
performances
to
the
removal
of
inhibitions
which
psychologically
prevent
an
athlete
from
doing
his
best
this
report
was
made
before
the
international
congress
on
health
and
fitness
in
the
modern
world
held
in
rome
during
the
last
olympic
games
all
reports
as
a
matter
of
fact
show
that
athletic
performances
are
improved
by
psychological
not
physical
means
and
that
automatic
reflexes
protect
the
athlete
against
the
danger
of
overexertion
at
all
levels
of
awareness
hypnotic
or
psychologists
are
using
hypnosis
more
and
more
to
facilitate
concentration
and
learning
and
it
is
likely
this
use
of
the
ancient
science
will
become
even
more
popular
than
its
medical
applications
the
reason
one
learns
so
quickly
under
hypnosis
is
because
of
time
distortion
which
allows
you
to
obtain
the
equivalent
of
many
hours
of
study
in
a
relatively
short
length
of
time
undoubtedly
you
have
had
experience
with
time
distortion
in
your
daily
life
remember
how
slowly
time
goes
when
you
are
not
interested
in
what
you
are
doing
and
how
fast
it
speeds
by
when
you
are
and
the
drowning
man
who
sees
his
whole
life
go
by
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
enough
people
have
been
saved
to
know
that
this
actually
happens
the
point
is
that
the
subconscious
mind
does
not
record
the
passage
of
time
the
same
way
as
the
conscious
mind
the
conscious
mind
records
time
physically
by
means
of
a
clock
it
is
objective
and
tells
you
that
a
thought
or
movement
requires
a
certain
number
of
seconds
minutes
hours
or
days
your
subconscious
mind
has
an
entirely
different
concept
of
time
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
physical
world
it
is
called
subjective
because
your
own
sense
of
the
passage
of
time
is
used
personal
time
varies
according
to
the
circumstances
in
which
you
find
yourself
have
you
noticed
that
when
you
are
happy
or
extremely
interested
in
something
time
passes
quickly
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
sad
or
anxious
time
seems
to
drag
this
is
called
time
distortion
when
you
continue
in
a
happy
state
time
is
automatically
shortened
when
you
are
in
a
state
of
unhappiness
pain
or
anxiety
time
automatically
lengthens
this
explains
why
the
drowning
man
can
review
his
entire
life
within
seconds
psychologists
know
this
is
possible
because
your
subconscious
mind
contains
a
complete
record
of
everything
that
has
happened
to
you
since
birth
therefore
in
moments
of
extreme
distress
your
subconscious
has
the
ability
to
distort
and
manipulate
time
if
you
have
ever
encountered
danger
or
had
a
narrow
escape
you
probably
experienced
time
distortion
everything
about
you
went
into
slow
motion
and
time
seemed
to
stand
still
until
the
action
was
over
at
that
point
objective
time
started
up
again
and
everything
returned
to
normal
many
of
you
no
doubt
read
an
associated
press
report
from
chicago
on
february
which
reported
how
movie
actress
linda
darnell
had
used
hypnosis
to
help
her
with
her
first
stage
role
she
had
been
asked
to
do
the
part
on
short
notice
and
had
no
time
for
preparation
miss
darnell
telephoned
her
california
physician
for
aid
he
flew
to
chicago
overnight
through
hypnosis
miss
darnell
learned
her
part
and
astounded
the
cast
by
knowing
everyone
lines
not
only
did
she
learn
the
part
but
she
was
coached
in
the
character
of
the
artist
she
was
portraying
as
a
result
late
love
was
a
hit
play
miss
darnell
was
under
the
impression
she
had
been
learning
the
part
for
a
week
although
only
about
hours
were
involved
and
these
hours
were
not
continuous
after
her
first
performance
she
said
i
never
felt
so
secure
about
playing
a
role
in
my
life
hypnosis
helped
me
feel
the
part
completely
imagine
how
much
more
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
learn
when
study
under
hypnosis
becomes
widespread
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
that
the
learning
is
in
your
mind
for
a
long
time
forgetting
or
mental
blocks
that
interfere
with
your
recall
of
the
information
at
any
time
are
reduced
to
a
minimum
in
conclusion
i
should
like
to
recommend
the
entire
field
of
to
everyone
it
is
a
therapy
which
is
positive
dynamic
and
constructive
an
excellent
example
of
this
is
contained
in
the
autobiography
in
this
book
immortal
rachmaninoff
describes
in
detail
his
success
in
overcoming
a
severe
case
of
mental
depression
he
had
stopped
composing
and
kept
to
himself
seldom
leaving
his
room
after
meeting
with
failure
using
the
available
therapeutic
remedies
available
at
that
time
he
was
persuaded
by
his
relatives
the
satins
to
seek
the
help
of
a
hypnotist
called
dahl
with
much
reluctance
he
agreed
to
see
dahl
and
be
treated
specifically
with
hypnosis
rachmaninoff
own
words
read
as
follows
although
it
may
sound
incredible
hypnosis
really
helped
me
already
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
i
began
again
to
compose
the
material
grew
in
bulk
and
new
musical
ideas
began
to
stir
within
me
far
more
than
i
needed
for
my
concerto
i
felt
that
dahl
treatment
had
strengthened
my
nervous
system
to
a
miraculous
degree
out
of
gratitude
i
dedicated
my
second
concerto
to
him
as
the
piece
had
a
great
success
in
moscow
everyone
began
to
wonder
what
possible
connection
it
could
have
with
dahl
the
truth
however
was
known
to
dahl
the
satins
and
myself
does
this
story
sound
incredible
you
have
the
word
of
one
of
the
world
greatest
musical
composers
that
hypnosis
alleviated
his
severe
despondency
this
is
proof
that
the
emotions
of
the
individual
can
be
changed
by
the
ideas
he
builds
up
about
himself
leland
hinsie
professor
of
psychiatry
columbia
university
writing
in
his
book
person
in
the
norton
states
in
some
persons
the
fear
of
disease
is
often
the
only
damaging
evidence
of
disease
yet
it
can
be
so
strong
as
to
disable
the
person
in
all
his
daily
activities
the
entire
field
of
psychosomatic
medicine
which
deals
with
the
interrelationship
between
body
and
mind
has
as
one
of
its
basic
tenets
that
suggestion
not
only
can
cause
psychological
personality
disorders
but
many
physical
disorders
as
well
it
is
therefore
logical
to
conclude
that
the
systematic
use
of
positive
mental
attitudes
in
an
organized
progressive
program
can
be
a
vital
influence
in
helping
you
lead
a
healthier
life
both
emotionally
and
physically

people
in
need
of
help
are
at

hypnotic
eyes
illustration
here
is
an
original
technique
that
can
be
used
very
successfully
in
inducing
hypnosis
the
technique
consists
of
using
two
glass
eyes
with
eyelashes
that
close
as
you
rotate
the
mechanism
that
holds
the
eyes
in
place
this
action
is
similar
to
closing
your
eyes
when
falling
asleep
you
suggest
to
the
subject
as
you
hold
these
two
eyes
between
your
thumb
and
first
finger
that
his
eyes
will
become
extremely
heavy
and
tired
as
the
eyes
that
you
are
holding
begin
to
close
you
then
gradually
begin
to
rotate
your
hand
which
causes
the
eyes
to
partially
close
the
subject
finding
it
extremely
difficult
to
look
at
the
eyes
begins
to
close
his
own
eyes
in
unison
with
those
that
you
are
holding
you
continue
giving
suggestions
of
hypnosis
and
before
you
know
it
the
subject
is
under
hypnosis
the
eyes
are
the
size
of
human
eyes
and
are
colored
blue
with
brown
eyelashes
in
order
to
give
the
exact
effect
of
looking
into
real
eyes
the
advantage
comes
in
the
fact
that
the
subject
begins
to
blink
his
eyes
immediately
and
you
suggest
to
him
that
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
hypnosis
it
is
just
about
impossible
to
look
into
anyone
eyes
without
blinking
and
this
technique
accomplishes
this
purpose
using
this
knowledge
you
incorporate
it
into
your
technique
and
induce
the
deep
hypnosis
accordingly
you
can
of
course
use
this
technique
for
as
well

you
incorporate

the

is
achieved
by
the
use
of
countless
plastic
linear
lenses
which
separate
the
multiple
images
laminated
behind
them
permitting
a
different
picture
to
change
continuously
as
you
change
the
angle
of
view
or
distance
naturally
this
device
is
extremely
helpful
in
capturing
the
full
attention
of
the
conscious
mind
of
the
subject

you
to
achieve

hypnotic
state

the

hypnotic
crystal
ball
is
extremely
useful
as
an
aid
in
inducing
the
hypnotic
state
it
is
desirable
to
use
it
as
an
object
of
concentration
for
your
subject
while
he
is
being
hypnotized
the
crystal
ball
lends
an
air
of
mysticism
to
the
attainment
of
the
hypnotic
sleep
and
for
some
of
your
subjects
this
is
the
best
approach
in
obtaining
hypnotic
control
there
are
individuals
who
will
not
react
to
a
strict
scientific
approach
to
hypnosis
and
it
is
with
these
subjects
that
the
use
of
such
a
device
as
the
crystal
ball
is
of
inestimable
value
the
crystal
ball
is
held
between
your
thumb
and
first
finger
about
twelve
inches
from
the
subject
eyes
and
slightly
above
eye
level
the
hypnotic
crystal
ball
can
easily
be
carried
with
you
at
all
times
as
you
know
the
employment
of
a
crystal
to
induce
the
hypnotic
sleep
is
one
of
the
oldest
methods
used
in
hypnosis
i
personally
favor
this
device
and
my
students
as
well
as
myself
have
always
had
excellent
results

an
effective
yet
inexpensive
method
of
inducing
hypnosis
is
with
the
aid
of
the
hypnodisc
spiral
in
my
book
hypnotism
revealed
a
picture
of
the
hypnodisc
unit
with
the
hypnodisc
spiral
attached
is
shown
above
is
a
picture
of
my
latest
hypnodisc
spiral
i
am
now
offering
the
hypnodisc
spiral
as
a
separate
unit
which
can
be
used
with
your
phonograph
turntable
the
spinning
spiral
will
cause
a
series
of
optical
illusions
causing
immediate
eye
strain
and
fatigue
the
subject
feels
that
he
is
being
drawn
into
a
deep
dark
revolving
cone
by
your
suggestions
of
hypnotic
sleep
you
can
place
your
subject
in
the
somnambulistic
state
very
easily
with
some
subjects
hypnosis
will
take
place
almost
instantaneously
this
technique
is
often
employed
in
stage
hypnotism
the
use
of
the
hypnodisc
spiral
is
also
an
excellent
method
of
achieving
as
you
concentrate
on
the
revolving
hypnodisc
spiral
you
give
yourself
suggestions
of
hypnotic
sleep
you
will
note
the
optical
illusions
as
they
occur
and
the
pleasant
relaxing
feeling
that
accompanies
these
illusions
giving
yourself
further
suggestions
of
hypnotic
sleep
you
find
that
you
are
easily
able
to
attain
the
desired
state
of
this
method
is
one
of
the
most
successful
and
popular
techniques
yet
known
for
achieving
and
at
the
wilshire
school
of
hypnotism
all
students
in
the
class
are
conditioned
with
the
aid
of
the
hypnodisc
spiral
during
my
lectures
i
place
the
entire
hypnodisc
unit
on
the
platform
without
having
the
spiral
revolve
continuing
with
the
lecture
i
note
individuals
in
the
audience
gazing
intently
at
the
hypnodisc
spiral
invariably
before
the
end
of
the
lecture
many
will
have
put
themselves
into
a
deep
hypnotic
state
this
group
was
achieved
without
my
mentioning
anything
about
the
hypnodisc
these
individuals
assumed
that
the
unit
is
used
to
induce
hypnosis
and
their
looking
at
it
with
that
thought
in
mind
produced
the
hypnotic
state
the
hypnodisc
spiral
is
printed
on
firm
cardboard
measures
twelve
inches
in
diameter
and
has
a
hole
in
the
center
so
you
can
place
it
on
your
own
phonograph
turntable
it
has
the
general
appearance
of
a
phonograph
record
i
am
sure
that
you
will
be
pleased
with
your
purchase
of
the
hypnodisc
the
hypnodisc
is
also
available
with
four
of
the
white
spiraling
areas
colored
in
four
different
shades
the
coloring
is
extremely
interesting
fascinating
and
very
effective

inducing
hypnosis

ips
one
of
the
chief
assets
of
a
good
hypnotist
is
to
be
flexible
in
his
approach
in
hypnotizing
his
subjects
as
you
know
it
is
necessary
many
times
to
adapt
a
technique
that
is
suitable
to
the
subject
and
not
to
make
the
subject
adapt
himself
to
the
method
of
induction
we
know
that
with
somnambulistic
subjects
any
procedure
will
put
the
subject
under
hypnosis
immediately
the
hypnotist
gains
complete
control
of
his
subject
just
as
fast
as
he
wants
unfortunately
most
subjects
do
not
respond
at
the
first
session
because
of
conscious
or
subconscious
fears
that
must
be
gradually
eliminated
once
you
get
the
subject
to
relax
or
let
go
he
will
naturally
succumb
to
hypnosis
this
is
the
problem
that
confronts
all
hypnotists
merely
suggesting
to
the
subject
to
relax
or
to
let
go
is
not
sufficient
as
a
rule
to
bring
about
this
desired
state
the
subject
at
this
point
can
not
turn
on
or
off
his
mental
and
physical
state
of
being
this
easily
even
if
we
have
the
subject
lie
down
this
does
not
assure
the
hypnotic
state
as
the
subject
can
still
be
tense
our
problem
is
how
to
get
the
subject
to
relax
our
situation
is
similar
to
the
physician
telling
his
patient
to
go
home
and
forget
about
a
certain
problem
i
sure
that
you
agree
that
the
advice
is
virtually
impossible
to
follow
one
of
the
major
stumbling
blocks
in
hypnotizing
a
subject
or
in
lies
in
the
fact
that
although
we
use
words
such
as
relax
let
yourself
go
and
other
similar
terminology
the
subject
can
not
readily
put
the
meaning
of
these
words
into
effect
it
is
difficult
for
most
people
to
let
go
when
we
live
in
a
society
that
beckons
us
to
look
sharp
be
sharp
be
alert
be
on
the
ball
and
make
every
minute
count
emphasis
on
productivity
does
not
lend
to
a
society
of
relaxed
individuals
in
my
long
experience
as
a
professional
hypnotist
i
have
tried
many
novel
innovations
for
inducing
hypnosis
some
have
met
with
a
great
deal
of
success
and
others
have
failed
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
causative
factors
for
success
or
failure
we
can
only
theorize
i
have
used
over
the
last
ten
years
a
technique
that
i
shall
describe
now
exceptionally
good
results
have
been
attained
with
it
however
it
is
not
infallible
it
is
suggested
to
you
as
another
good
technique
in
order
to
help
the
subject
relax
i
have
been
using
a
one
hour
tape
recorder
recording
containing
the
continuous
sound
of
various
degrees
of
rain
one
half
hour
has
a
rain
effect
of
very
soft
light
rainfall
as
on
grass
canvas
or
tent
top
the
other
side
contains
a
half
hour
of
a
rain
effect
such
as
one
would
hear
in
a
heavy
downfall
with
prominent
patter
of
water
on
pavement
the
subject
is
instructed
to
close
his
eyes
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
rain
while
picturing
himself
relaxing
near
a
warm
glowing
fireplace
the
relaxing
effect
thus
produced
enhances
our
chances
for
success
in
attaining
a
deep
hypnotic
state
the
tape
will
play
on
all
standard
recorders
and
comes
recorded
at
a
speed

the
