was
tired
tired
of
the
jolting
saddle
of
his
motor
bicycle
of
the
cramped
position
of
his
arms
of
the
chug
of
the
engine
and
most
of
all
of
the
dreary
barren
country
through
which
he
was
riding
early
that
morning
he
had
left
pau
and
with
the
exception
of
an
hour
and
a
half
at
bayonne
where
he
had
lunched
and
paid
a
short
business
call
he
had
been
at
it
ever
since
it
was
now
after
five
and
the
last
post
he
had
noticed
showed
him
he
was
still
kilometers
from
bordeaux
where
he
intended
to
spend
the
night
this
confounded
road
has
no
end
he
thought
i
really
must
stretch
my
legs
a
a
short
distance
in
front
of
him
a
hump
in
the
white
ribbon
of
the
road
with
parapet
walls
narrowing
in
at
each
side
indicated
a
bridge
he
cut
off
his
engine
and
allowing
the
machine
to
coast
brought
it
to
a
stand
at
the
summit
then
dismounting
he
slid
it
back
on
its
bracket
stretched
himself
luxuriously
and
looked
around
in
both
directions
in
front
of
him
and
behind
the
road
stretched
level
and
monotonous
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
as
he
had
seen
it
stretch
with
but
few
exceptions
during
the
whole
of
the
day
run
but
whereas
farther
south
it
had
led
through
open
country
desolate
depressing
wastes
of
sand
and
sedge
here
it
ran
through
the
heart
of
a
pine
forest
in
its
own
way
as
melancholy
the
road
seemed
isolated
cut
off
from
the
surrounding
country
like
to
be
squeezed
out
of
existence
by
the
overwhelming
barrier
on
either
flank
a
screen
aromatic
indeed
but
dark
gloomy
and
forbidding
nor
was
the
prospect
improved
by
the
long
unsightly
gashes
which
the
resin
collectors
had
made
on
the
trunks
suggesting
as
they
did
that
the
trees
were
stricken
by
some
disease
to
merriman
the
country
seemed
utterly
uninhabited
indeed
since
running
through
labouheyre
now
two
hours
back
he
could
not
recall
having
seen
a
single
living
creature
except
those
passing
in
motor
cars
and
of
these
even
there
were
but
few
he
rested
his
arms
on
the
masonry
coping
of
the
old
bridge
and
drew
at
his
cigarette
but
for
the
distant
rumble
of
an
approaching
vehicle
the
spring
evening
was
very
still
the
river
curved
away
gently
towards
the
left
flowing
black
and
sluggish
between
its
flat
banks
on
which
the
pines
grew
down
to
the
water
edge
it
was
delightful
to
stay
quiet
for
a
few
moments
and
merriman
took
off
his
cap
and
let
the
cool
air
blow
on
his
forehead
enjoying
the
relaxation
he
was
a
man
of
about
clean
shaven
and
with
gray
honest
eyes
dark
hair
slightly
inclined
to
curl
and
a
square
jaw
business
had
brought
him
to
france
junior
partner
in
the
firm
of
edwards
merriman
wine
merchants
gracechurch
street
london
he
annually
made
a
tour
of
the
exporters
with
whom
his
firm
dealt
he
had
worked
across
the
south
of
the
country
from
cette
to
pau
and
was
now
about
to
recross
from
bordeaux
to
near
avignon
after
which
his
round
would
be
complete
to
him
this
part
of
his
business
was
a
pleasure
and
he
enjoyed
his
annual
trip
almost
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
a
holiday
the
vehicle
which
he
had
heard
in
the
distance
was
now
close
by
and
he
turned
idly
to
watch
it
pass
he
did
not
know
then
that
this
slight
action
performed
almost
involuntarily
was
to
change
his
whole
life
and
not
only
his
but
the
lives
of
a
number
of
other
people
of
whose
existence
he
was
not
then
aware
was
to
lead
to
sorrow
as
well
as
happiness
to
crime
as
well
as
the
vindication
of
the
law
to
in
short
what
is
more
to
the
point
had
he
not
then
looked
round
this
story
would
never
have
been
written
the
vehicle
in
itself
was
in
no
way
remarkable
it
was
a
motor
lorry
of
about
five
tons
capacity
a
heavy
thing
travelling
slowly
attention
at
first
focused
itself
on
the
driver
he
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
with
thin
features
an
aquiline
nose
and
dark
eyes
dressed
though
he
was
in
rough
working
clothes
there
was
a
something
in
his
appearance
in
his
pose
which
suggested
a
man
of
better
social
standing
than
his
occupation
warranted
thought
merriman
as
his
gaze
passed
on
to
the
lorry
behind
it
was
painted
a
dirty
green
and
was
empty
except
for
a
single
heavy
casting
evidently
part
of
some
large
and
massive
machine
on
the
side
of
the
deck
was
a
brass
plate
bearing
the
words
in
english
the
landes
syndicate
no
merriman
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
a
nameplate
in
his
own
language
in
so
unexpected
a
quarter
but
the
matter
really
did
not
interest
him
and
he
soon
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
the
machine
chuffed
ponderously
past
and
merriman
by
now
rested
turned
to
restart
his
bicycle
but
his
troubles
for
the
day
were
not
over
on
the
ground
below
his
tank
was
a
stain
and
even
as
he
looked
a
drop
fell
from
the
carburetor
feed
pipe
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
he
bent
down
to
examine
and
speedily
found
the
cause
of
the
trouble
the
feed
pipe
was
connected
to
the
bottom
of
the
tank
by
a
union
and
the
nut
working
slack
had
allowed
a
small
but
steady
leak
he
tightened
the
nut
and
turned
to
measure
the
petrol
in
the
tank
a
glance
showed
him
that
a
mere
drain
only
remained
curse
it
all
he
muttered
that
the
second
time
that
confounded
nut
has
left
me
in
the
his
position
was
a
trifle
awkward
he
was
still
some
kilometers
from
bordeaux
and
his
machine
would
not
carry
him
more
than
perhaps
two
of
course
he
could
stop
the
first
car
that
approached
and
no
doubt
borrow
enough
petrol
to
make
the
city
but
all
day
he
had
noticed
with
surprise
how
few
and
far
between
the
cars
were
and
there
was
no
certainty
that
one
would
pass
within
a
reasonable
time
then
the
sound
of
the
receding
lorry
still
faintly
audible
suggested
an
idea
it
was
travelling
so
slowly
that
he
might
overtake
it
before
his
petrol
gave
out
it
was
true
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
and
if
he
failed
he
would
be
still
farther
from
his
goal
but
when
you
are
kilometers
from
where
you
want
to
be
a
few
hundred
yards
more
or
less
is
not
worth
worrying
about
he
wheeled
his
machine
round
and
followed
the
lorry
at
full
speed
but
he
had
not
more
than
started
when
he
noticed
his
quarry
turning
to
the
right
slowly
it
disappeared
into
the
forest
funny
i
did
see
that
road
thought
merriman
as
he
bumped
along
he
slackened
speed
when
he
reached
the
place
where
the
lorry
had
vanished
and
then
he
saw
a
narrow
lane
just
wide
enough
to
allow
the
big
vehicle
to
pass
which
curved
away
between
the
tree
stems
the
surface
was
badly
cut
up
with
wheel
tracks
so
much
so
that
merriman
decided
he
could
not
ride
it
he
therefore
dismounted
hid
his
bicycle
among
the
trees
and
pushed
on
down
the
lane
on
foot
he
was
convinced
from
his
knowledge
of
the
country
that
the
latter
must
be
a
at
the
end
of
which
he
would
find
the
lorry
this
he
could
hear
not
far
away
chugging
slowly
on
in
front
of
him
the
lane
twisted
incessantly
apparently
to
avoid
the
larger
trees
the
surface
was
the
virgin
soil
of
the
forest
only
but
the
ruts
had
been
filled
roughly
with
broken
stones
merriman
strode
on
and
suddenly
as
he
rounded
one
of
the
bends
he
got
the
surprise
of
his
life
coming
to
meet
him
along
the
lane
was
a
girl
this
in
itself
was
perhaps
not
remarkable
but
this
girl
seemed
so
out
of
place
amid
such
surroundings
or
even
in
such
a
district
that
merriman
was
quite
taken
aback
she
was
of
medium
height
slender
and
graceful
as
a
lily
and
looked
about
she
was
a
study
in
brown
on
her
head
was
a
brown
tam
a
rich
warm
brown
like
the
brown
of
autumn
bracken
on
the
moor
she
wore
a
brown
jumper
brown
skirt
brown
stockings
and
little
brown
brogued
shoes
as
she
came
closer
merriman
saw
that
her
eyes
friendly
honest
eyes
were
a
shade
of
golden
brown
and
that
a
hint
of
gold
also
gleamed
in
the
brown
of
her
hair
she
was
pretty
not
classically
beautiful
but
very
charming
and
she
walked
with
the
free
easy
movement
of
one
accustomed
to
an
life
as
they
drew
abreast
merriman
pulled
off
his
cap
pardon
mademoiselle
he
said
in
his
somewhat
halting
french
but
can
you
tell
me
if
i
could
get
some
petrol
close
by
and
in
a
few
words
he
explained
his
predicament
she
looked
him
over
with
a
sharp
scrutinizing
glance
apparently
satisfied
she
smiled
slightly
and
replied
but
certainly
monsieur
come
to
the
mill
and
my
father
will
get
you
some
he
is
the
she
spoke
even
more
haltingly
than
he
had
and
with
no
semblance
of
a
french
accent
the
french
rather
of
an
english
school
he
stared
at
her
but
you
english
he
cried
in
surprise
she
laughed
lightly
of
course
i
english
she
answered
why
should
i
be
english
but
i
do
think
you
very
polite
about
it
you
he
apologized
in
some
confusion
it
was
the
unexpectedness
of
meeting
a
in
this
out
of
the
way
wood
it
was
he
did
not
mean
you
want
to
say
my
french
is
not
really
so
bad
after
all
she
said
relentlessly
and
then
i
can
tell
you
it
a
lot
better
than
when
we
came
then
you
are
a
newcomer
we
not
out
very
long
it
rather
a
change
from
london
as
you
may
imagine
but
it
not
such
a
bad
country
as
it
looks
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
dreadful
but
i
have
grown
to
like
she
had
turned
with
him
and
they
were
now
walking
together
between
the
tall
straight
stems
of
the
trees
i
a
londoner
said
merriman
slowly
i
wonder
if
we
have
any
mutual
acquaintances
it
hardly
likely
since
my
mother
died
some
years
ago
we
have
lived
very
quietly
and
gone
out
very
merriman
did
not
wish
to
appear
inquisitive
he
made
a
suitable
reply
and
turning
the
conversation
to
the
country
told
her
of
his
ride
she
listened
eagerly
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
she
was
lonely
and
delighted
to
have
anyone
to
talk
to
she
certainly
seemed
a
charming
girl
simple
natural
and
friendly
and
obviously
a
lady
but
soon
their
walk
came
to
an
end
some
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
wood
the
lane
debouched
into
a
large
clearing
it
had
evidently
been
recently
made
for
the
tops
of
many
of
the
dotted
thickly
over
the
ground
were
still
white
round
the
semicircle
of
the
forest
trees
were
lying
cut
some
with
their
branches
still
intact
others
stripped
clear
to
long
straight
poles
two
small
gangs
of
men
were
at
work
one
felling
the
other
lopping
across
the
clearing
forming
its
other
boundary
and
the
straight
side
of
the
d
ran
a
river
apparently
from
its
direction
that
which
merriman
had
looked
down
on
from
the
road
bridge
it
was
wider
here
a
fine
stretch
of
water
though
still
dark
colored
and
uninviting
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
on
its
bank
forming
a
center
to
the
cleared
semicircle
was
a
building
evidently
the
mill
it
was
a
small
place
consisting
of
a
single
long
narrow
galvanized
iron
shed
and
placed
parallel
to
the
river
in
front
of
the
shed
was
a
tiny
wharf
and
behind
it
were
stacks
and
stacks
of
tree
trunks
cut
in
short
lengths
and
built
as
if
for
seasoning
decauville
tramways
radiated
from
the
shed
and
the
men
were
running
in
timber
in
the
trucks
from
the
mill
came
the
hard
biting
screech
of
a
circular
saw
a
sawmill
merriman
exclaimed
rather
unnecessarily
yes
we
cut
for
the
english
coal
mines
those
are
they
you
see
stacked
up
as
soon
as
they
are
drier
they
will
be
shipped
across
my
father
joined
with
some
others
in
putting
up
the
capital
and
voila
she
indicated
the
clearing
and
its
contents
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
her
hand
by
jove
a
jolly
fine
notion
too
i
should
say
you
have
everything
handy
trees
handy
river
handy
i
suppose
from
the
look
of
that
wharf
that
ships
can
come
up
shallow
draughted
ones
only
but
we
have
our
own
motor
ship
specially
built
and
always
running
it
makes
the
round
trip
in
about
ten
by
jove
merriman
said
again
splendid
and
is
that
where
you
live
he
pointed
to
a
house
standing
on
a
little
hillock
near
the
edge
of
the
clearing
at
the
far
or
side
of
the
mill
it
was
a
rough
but
not
building
of
galvanized
iron
and
with
a
piazza
in
front
from
a
brick
chimney
a
thin
spiral
of
blue
smoke
was
floating
up
lazily
into
the
calm
air
the
girl
nodded
it
not
palatial
but
it
really
wonderfully
comfortable
she
explained
and
oh
the
fires
i
never
seen
such
glorious
wood
fires
as
we
have
cuttings
you
know
we
have
more
blocks
than
we
know
what
to
do
i
can
imagine
i
wish
we
had
in
they
were
walking
not
too
rapidly
across
the
clearing
towards
the
mill
at
the
back
of
the
shed
were
a
number
of
doors
and
opposite
one
of
them
heading
into
the
opening
stood
the
motor
lorry
the
engine
was
still
running
but
the
driver
had
disappeared
apparently
into
the
building
as
the
two
came
up
merriman
once
more
ran
his
eye
idly
over
the
vehicle
and
then
he
felt
a
sudden
mild
surprise
as
one
feels
when
some
unexpected
though
quite
trivial
incident
takes
place
he
had
felt
sure
that
this
lorry
standing
at
the
mill
door
was
that
which
had
passed
him
on
the
bridge
and
which
he
had
followed
down
the
lane
but
now
he
saw
it
was
he
had
noted
idly
but
quite
distinctly
that
the
original
machine
was
no
this
one
had
a
precisely
similar
plate
but
it
bore
the
legend
the
landes
syndicate
no
though
the
matter
was
of
no
importance
merriman
was
a
little
intrigued
and
he
looked
more
closely
at
the
vehicle
as
he
did
so
his
surprise
grew
and
his
trifling
interest
became
mystification
the
lorry
was
the
same
at
least
there
on
the
top
was
the
casting
just
as
he
had
seen
it
it
was
inconceivable
that
two
similar
lorries
should
have
two
identical
castings
arranged
in
the
same
way
and
at
the
same
time
and
place
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
just
possible
but
as
he
looked
he
noticed
a
detail
which
settled
the
matter
the
casting
was
steadied
by
some
rough
billets
of
wood
one
of
these
billets
was
split
and
a
splinter
of
curious
shape
had
partially
entered
a
bolt
hole
he
recalled
now
though
it
had
slipped
from
his
memory
that
he
had
noticed
that
splinter
as
the
lorry
passed
him
on
the
bridge
it
was
therefore
unquestionably
and
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
the
same
machine
involuntarily
he
stopped
and
stood
staring
at
the
number
plate
wondering
if
his
recollection
of
that
seen
at
the
bridge
could
be
at
fault
he
thought
not
in
fact
he
was
certain
he
recalled
the
shape
of
the
which
had
an
unusually
small
hollow
in
the
middle
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
of
this
either
he
remained
motionless
for
a
few
seconds
puzzling
over
the
problem
and
was
just
about
to
remark
on
it
when
the
girl
broke
in
hurriedly
father
will
be
in
the
office
she
said
and
her
voice
was
sharpened
as
from
anxiety
wo
you
come
and
see
him
about
the
petrol
he
looked
at
her
curiously
the
smile
had
gone
from
her
lips
and
her
face
was
pale
she
was
frowning
and
in
her
eyes
there
showed
unmistakable
fear
she
was
not
looking
at
him
and
his
gaze
followed
the
direction
of
hers
the
driver
had
come
out
of
the
shed
the
same
dark
man
as
had
passed
him
on
the
bridge
he
had
stopped
and
was
staring
at
merriman
with
an
intense
regard
in
which
doubt
and
suspicion
rapidly
changed
to
hostility
for
a
moment
neither
man
moved
and
then
once
again
the
girl
voice
broke
in
oh
there
is
father
she
cried
with
barely
disguised
relief
in
her
tones
come
wo
you
and
speak
to
the
interruption
broke
the
spell
the
driver
averted
his
eyes
and
stooped
over
his
engine
merriman
turned
towards
the
girl
and
the
little
incident
was
over
it
was
evident
to
merriman
that
he
had
in
some
way
put
his
foot
in
it
how
he
could
not
imagine
unless
there
was
really
something
in
the
matter
of
the
number
plate
but
it
was
equally
clear
to
him
that
his
companion
wished
to
ignore
the
affair
and
he
therefore
expelled
it
from
his
mind
for
the
moment
and
once
again
following
the
direction
of
her
gaze
moved
towards
a
man
who
was
approaching
from
the
far
end
of
the
shed
he
was
tall
and
slender
like
his
daughter
and
walked
with
lithe
slightly
feline
movements
his
face
was
oval
clear
skinned
and
with
a
pallid
complexion
made
still
paler
by
his
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
a
tiny
mustache
almost
black
and
with
waxed
and
pointed
ends
he
was
as
to
features
but
the
face
was
weak
and
the
expression
a
trifle
shifty
his
daughter
greeted
him
still
with
some
perturbation
in
her
manner
we
were
just
looking
for
you
daddy
she
called
a
little
breathlessly
this
gentleman
is
cycling
to
bordeaux
and
has
run
out
of
petrol
he
asked
me
if
there
was
any
to
be
had
hereabouts
so
i
told
him
you
could
give
him
the
newcomer
honored
merriman
with
a
rapid
though
searching
and
suspicious
glance
but
he
replied
politely
and
in
a
cultured
voice
quite
right
my
he
turned
to
merriman
and
spoke
in
french
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
supply
you
monsieur
how
much
do
you
want
thanks
awfully
sir
merriman
answered
in
his
own
language
english
it
very
good
of
you
i
sure
and
i
sorry
to
be
giving
so
much
trouble
a
liter
should
run
me
to
bordeaux
or
say
a
little
more
in
case
of
i
give
you
two
liters
it
no
trouble
at
he
turned
and
spoke
in
rapid
french
to
the
driver
oui
monsieur
the
man
replied
and
then
stepping
up
to
his
chief
he
said
something
in
a
low
voice
the
other
started
slightly
for
a
moment
looked
concerned
then
instantly
recovering
himself
advanced
to
merriman
henri
here
will
send
a
man
with
a
can
to
where
you
have
left
your
machine
he
said
then
continued
with
a
suave
smile
and
so
sir
you
english
it
is
not
often
that
we
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
in
these
i
suppose
not
sir
but
i
can
assure
you
your
pleasure
and
surprise
is
as
nothing
to
mine
you
are
not
only
a
but
a
friend
in
need
as
my
dear
sir
i
know
what
it
is
to
run
out
of
spirit
and
i
suppose
there
is
no
place
in
the
whole
of
france
where
you
might
go
farther
without
finding
any
than
this
very
district
you
are
on
pleasure
bent
i
presume
merriman
shook
his
head
unfortunately
no
he
replied
i
travelling
for
my
firm
edwards
merriman
wine
merchants
of
london
i
merriman
seymour
merriman
and
i
going
round
the
exporters
with
whom
we
a
pleasant
way
to
do
it
merriman
my
name
is
coburn
you
see
i
am
trying
to
change
the
face
of
the
country
here
yes
miss
merriman
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
the
girl
miss
coburn
told
me
what
you
were
doing
a
splendid
notion
i
yes
i
think
we
are
going
to
make
it
pay
very
well
i
suppose
not
making
a
long
stay
two
days
in
bordeaux
sir
then
i
off
east
to
do
you
know
i
rather
envy
you
one
gets
tired
of
these
tree
trunks
and
the
noise
of
the
saws
ah
there
is
your
a
workman
had
appeared
with
a
red
can
of
shell
well
merriman
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
you
will
excuse
my
not
going
farther
with
you
but
i
am
really
supposed
to
be
he
turned
to
his
daughter
with
a
smile
you
madeleine
can
see
merriman
to
the
road
he
shook
hands
declined
merriman
request
to
be
allowed
to
pay
for
the
petrol
and
cutting
short
the
other
thanks
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
turned
back
to
the
shed
the
two
young
people
strolled
slowly
back
across
the
clearing
the
girl
evidently
disposed
to
make
the
most
of
the
unwonted
companionship
and
merriman
no
less
ready
to
prolong
so
delightful
an
interview
but
in
spite
of
the
pleasure
of
their
conversation
he
could
not
banish
from
his
mind
the
little
incident
which
had
taken
place
and
he
determined
to
ask
a
discreet
question
or
two
about
it
i
say
he
said
during
a
pause
in
their
talk
i
afraid
i
upset
your
lorry
man
somehow
did
you
notice
the
way
he
looked
at
me
the
girl
manner
which
up
to
this
had
been
easy
and
careless
changed
suddenly
becoming
constrained
and
a
trifle
but
she
answered
readily
enough
yes
i
saw
it
but
you
must
not
mind
henri
he
was
badly
you
know
and
he
has
never
been
the
same
oh
i
sorry
merriman
apologized
wondering
if
the
man
could
be
a
relative
both
my
brothers
suffered
from
it
they
were
pretty
bad
but
they
coming
all
right
it
generally
a
question
of
time
i
i
hope
so
miss
coburn
rejoined
and
quietly
but
decisively
changed
the
subject
they
began
to
compare
notes
about
london
and
merriman
was
sorry
when
having
filled
his
tank
and
pushed
his
bicycle
to
the
road
he
could
no
longer
with
decency
find
an
excuse
for
remaining
in
her
company
he
bade
her
a
regretful
farewell
and
some
later
was
mounting
the
steps
of
his
hotel
in
bordeaux
that
evening
and
many
times
later
his
mind
reverted
to
the
incident
of
the
lorry
at
the
time
she
made
it
miss
coburn
statement
about
the
had
seemed
entirely
to
account
for
the
action
of
henri
the
driver
but
now
merriman
was
not
so
sure
the
more
he
thought
over
the
affair
the
more
certain
he
felt
that
he
had
not
made
a
mistake
about
the
number
plate
and
the
more
likely
it
appeared
that
the
driver
had
guessed
what
he
merriman
had
noticed
and
resented
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
here
some
secret
which
the
man
was
afraid
might
become
known
and
merriman
could
not
but
admit
to
himself
that
all
miss
coburn
actions
were
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
she
also
shared
that
secret
and
that
fear
and
yet
the
idea
was
grotesque
that
there
could
be
anything
serious
in
the
altering
of
the
number
plate
of
a
motor
lorry
assuming
that
he
was
not
mistaken
even
if
the
thing
had
been
done
it
was
a
trivial
matter
and
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
motives
for
it
as
well
as
its
consequences
must
be
trivial
it
was
intriguing
but
no
one
could
imagine
it
to
be
important
as
merriman
cycled
eastward
through
france
his
interest
in
the
affair
gradually
waned
and
when
a
fortnight
later
he
reached
england
he
had
ceased
to
give
it
a
serious
thought
but
the
image
of
miss
coburn
did
not
so
quickly
vanish
from
his
imagination
and
many
times
he
regretted
he
had
not
taken
an
opportunity
of
returning
to
the
mill
to
renew
the
acquaintanceship
so
unexpectedly
begun
chapter
an
interesting
suggestion
about
ten
on
a
fine
evening
towards
the
end
of
june
some
six
weeks
after
the
incident
described
in
the
last
chapter
merriman
formed
one
of
a
group
of
young
men
seated
round
the
open
window
of
the
smoking
room
in
the
rovers
club
in
cranbourne
street
they
had
dined
together
and
were
enjoying
a
slack
hour
and
a
little
desultory
conversation
before
moving
on
some
to
catch
trains
to
the
suburbs
some
to
their
chambers
in
town
and
others
to
round
off
the
evening
with
some
livelier
form
of
amusement
the
rovers
had
premises
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
large
building
near
the
hippodrome
its
membership
consisted
principally
of
business
and
professional
men
but
there
was
also
a
sprinkling
of
members
of
parliament
political
secretaries
and
minor
government
officials
who
though
its
position
was
not
ideal
were
attracted
to
it
because
of
the
moderation
of
its
subscription
and
the
excellence
of
its
cuisine
the
evening
was
calm
and
the
sounds
from
the
street
below
seemed
to
float
up
lazily
to
the
little
group
in
the
open
window
as
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
and
cigars
floated
up
lazily
to
the
ceiling
above
the
gentle
hum
of
the
traffic
made
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
their
conversation
as
the
holding
down
of
a
soft
pedal
fills
in
and
supports
dreamy
organ
music
but
for
the
six
young
men
in
the
bow
window
the
room
was
untenanted
save
for
a
waiter
who
had
just
brought
some
fresh
drinks
and
who
was
now
clearing
away
empty
glasses
from
an
adjoining
table
the
talk
had
turned
on
foreign
travel
and
more
than
one
member
had
related
experiences
which
he
had
undergone
while
abroad
merriman
was
tired
and
had
been
rather
silent
but
it
was
suddenly
borne
in
on
him
that
it
was
his
duty
as
one
of
the
hosts
of
the
evening
to
contribute
somewhat
more
fully
towards
the
conversation
he
determined
to
relate
his
little
adventure
at
the
sawmill
of
the
syndicate
he
therefore
lit
a
fresh
cigar
and
began
to
speak
any
of
you
fellows
know
the
country
just
south
of
bordeaux
he
asked
and
as
no
one
responded
he
went
on
i
know
it
a
bit
for
i
have
to
go
through
it
every
year
on
my
trip
round
the
wine
exporters
this
year
a
rather
queer
thing
happened
when
i
was
about
half
an
hour
run
from
bordeaux
absolutely
a
trivial
thing
and
of
no
importance
you
understand
but
it
puzzled
me
maybe
some
of
you
could
throw
some
light
on
it
proceed
my
dear
sir
with
your
trivial
narrative
invited
jelfs
a
man
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
group
we
shall
give
it
the
weighty
consideration
which
it
doubtless
jelfs
was
a
stockbroker
and
the
professional
wit
of
the
party
he
was
a
good
soul
but
boring
merriman
took
no
notice
of
the
interruption
it
was
between
five
and
six
in
the
evening
he
went
on
and
he
told
in
some
detail
of
his
day
run
culminating
in
his
visit
to
the
sawmill
and
his
discovery
of
the
alteration
in
the
number
of
the
lorry
he
gave
the
facts
exactly
as
they
had
occurred
with
the
single
exception
that
he
made
no
mention
of
his
meeting
with
madeleine
coburn
and
what
happened
asked
drake
another
of
the
men
when
he
had
finished
nothing
more
happened
merriman
returned
the
manager
came
and
gave
me
some
petrol
and
i
cleared
out
the
point
is
why
should
that
number
plate
have
been
changed
jelfs
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
speaker
and
gave
the
little
sidelong
nod
which
indicated
to
the
others
that
another
joke
was
about
to
be
perpetrated
you
say
he
asked
impressively
that
the
lorry
was
at
first
and
then
are
you
sure
you
have
made
a
mistake
of
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
it
a
common
enough
phenomenon
for
a
no
lorry
to
change
after
lunch
let
us
say
into
no
are
you
sure
it
merriman
joined
in
the
laughter
against
him
it
was
you
old
blighter
he
said
it
was
on
the
road
and
at
the
mill
and
i
as
sure
of
it
as
that
you
an
amiable
inconclusive
murmured
jelfs
entirely
inconclusive
but
he
persisted
you
must
not
hold
back
material
evidence
you
have
told
us
yet
what
you
had
at
oh
stow
it
jelfs
said
hilliard
a
young
man
who
had
not
yet
spoken
have
you
no
theory
yourself
merriman
none
i
was
completely
puzzled
i
would
have
mentioned
it
before
only
it
seemed
to
be
making
a
mountain
out
of
i
think
jelfs
question
should
be
answered
you
know
drake
said
critically
and
after
some
more
chaff
the
subject
dropped
shortly
after
one
of
the
men
had
to
leave
to
catch
his
train
and
the
party
broke
up
as
they
left
the
building
merriman
found
hilliard
at
his
elbow
are
you
walking
the
latter
queried
if
so
i
come
claud
hilliard
was
the
son
of
a
clergyman
in
the
midlands
a
keen
not
to
say
brilliant
student
who
had
passed
through
both
school
and
college
with
distinction
and
was
already
at
the
age
of
making
a
name
for
himself
on
the
headquarters
staff
of
the
customs
department
his
thin
eager
face
with
its
hooked
nose
pale
blue
eyes
and
light
rather
hair
formed
a
true
index
of
his
nimble
somewhat
speculative
mind
what
he
did
he
did
with
his
might
he
was
keenly
interested
in
whatever
he
took
up
showing
a
tendency
indeed
to
ride
his
hobbies
to
death
he
had
a
particular
penchant
for
puzzles
of
all
kinds
and
many
a
knotty
problem
brought
to
him
as
a
last
court
of
appeal
received
a
surprisingly
rapid
and
complete
solution
his
detractors
while
admitting
his
ingenuity
and
the
almost
uncanny
rapidity
with
which
he
seized
on
the
essential
facts
of
a
case
said
he
was
lacking
in
staying
power
but
if
this
were
so
he
had
not
as
yet
shown
signs
of
it
he
and
merriman
had
first
met
on
business
when
hilliard
was
sent
to
the
wine
merchants
on
some
matter
of
customs
the
acquaintanceship
thus
formed
had
ripened
into
a
mild
friendship
though
the
two
had
not
seen
a
great
deal
of
each
other
they
passed
up
coventry
street
and
across
the
circus
into
piccadilly
hilliard
had
a
flat
in
a
side
street
off
knightsbridge
while
merriman
lived
farther
west
in
kensington
at
the
door
of
the
flat
hilliard
stopped
come
in
for
a
last
drink
wo
you
he
invited
it
ages
since
you
been
merriman
agreed
and
soon
the
two
friends
were
seated
at
another
open
window
in
the
small
but
comfortable
of
the
flat
they
chatted
for
some
time
and
then
hilliard
turned
the
conversation
to
the
story
merriman
had
told
in
the
club
you
know
he
said
knocking
the
ash
carefully
off
his
cigar
i
was
rather
interested
in
that
tale
of
yours
it
quite
an
intriguing
little
mystery
i
suppose
it
not
possible
that
you
could
have
made
a
mistake
about
those
numbers
merriman
laughed
i
not
exactly
infallible
and
i
have
once
or
twice
in
my
life
made
mistakes
but
i
do
think
i
made
one
this
time
you
see
the
only
question
is
the
number
at
the
bridge
the
number
at
the
mill
is
certain
my
attention
was
drawn
to
it
and
i
looked
at
it
too
often
for
there
to
be
the
slightest
doubt
it
was
no
as
certainly
as
i
alive
but
the
number
at
the
bridge
is
different
there
was
nothing
to
draw
my
attention
to
it
and
i
only
glanced
at
it
casually
i
would
say
that
i
was
mistaken
about
it
only
for
one
thing
it
was
a
black
figure
on
a
polished
brass
ground
and
i
particularly
remarked
that
the
black
lines
were
very
wide
leaving
an
unusually
small
brass
triangle
in
the
center
if
i
noticed
that
it
must
have
been
a
hilliard
nodded
pretty
conclusive
i
should
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
then
moved
a
little
irresolutely
do
think
me
impertinent
old
man
he
went
on
with
a
sidelong
glance
but
i
imagined
from
your
manner
you
were
holding
something
back
is
there
more
in
the
story
than
you
told
it
was
now
merriman
turn
to
hesitate
although
madeleine
coburn
had
been
in
his
thoughts
more
or
less
continuously
since
he
returned
to
town
he
had
never
mentioned
her
name
and
he
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
to
now
sorry
i
spoke
old
man
hilliard
went
on
do
mind
merriman
came
to
a
decision
not
at
all
he
answered
slowly
i
a
fool
to
make
any
mystery
of
it
i
tell
you
there
is
a
girl
there
the
manager
daughter
i
met
her
in
the
lane
when
i
was
following
the
lorry
and
asked
her
about
petrol
she
was
frightfully
decent
came
back
with
me
and
told
her
father
what
i
wanted
and
all
that
but
hilliard
here
the
point
she
knew
something
and
she
knows
it
too
she
got
quite
scared
when
that
driver
fixed
me
with
his
eyes
and
tried
to
get
me
away
and
she
was
quite
unmistakably
relieved
when
the
incident
passed
then
later
her
father
suggested
she
should
see
me
to
the
road
and
on
the
way
i
mentioned
the
thing
said
i
was
afraid
i
had
upset
the
driver
somehow
and
she
got
embarrassed
at
once
told
me
the
man
was
implying
that
he
was
queer
and
switched
off
on
to
another
subject
so
pointedly
i
had
to
let
it
go
at
hilliard
eyes
glistened
quite
a
good
little
mystery
he
said
i
suppose
the
man
could
have
been
a
relation
or
even
her
fiancee
that
occurred
to
me
and
it
is
possible
but
i
do
think
so
i
believe
she
wanted
to
try
to
account
for
his
manner
so
as
to
prevent
my
smelling
a
and
she
did
not
account
for
it
perhaps
she
did
but
again
i
do
think
so
i
have
a
pretty
good
knowledge
of
as
you
know
and
it
did
look
like
it
to
me
i
do
suggest
she
was
speaking
the
truth
i
mean
that
this
particular
action
did
seem
to
be
so
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
merriman
continued
there
was
another
thing
which
might
bear
in
the
same
direction
or
again
it
may
only
be
my
imagination
i
not
sure
of
it
i
told
you
the
manager
appeared
just
in
the
middle
of
the
little
scene
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
driver
went
up
to
him
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
and
the
manager
started
and
looked
at
me
and
seemed
annoyed
but
it
was
very
slight
and
only
for
a
second
i
would
have
noticed
nothing
only
for
what
went
before
he
was
quite
polite
and
friendly
immediately
after
and
i
may
have
been
mistaken
and
imagined
the
whole
but
it
works
in
hilliard
commented
if
the
driver
saw
what
you
were
looking
at
and
your
expression
he
would
naturally
guess
what
you
had
noticed
and
he
would
warn
his
boss
that
you
had
tumbled
to
it
the
manager
would
look
surprised
and
annoyed
for
a
moment
then
he
would
see
he
must
divert
your
suspicion
and
talk
to
you
as
if
nothing
had
quite
that
just
what
i
thought
but
again
i
may
have
been
they
continued
discussing
the
matter
for
some
time
longer
and
then
the
conversation
turned
into
other
channels
finally
the
clocks
chiming
midnight
aroused
merriman
and
he
got
up
and
said
he
must
be
going
three
days
later
he
had
a
note
from
hilliard
come
in
tonight
about
ten
if
you
are
doing
nothing
it
read
i
have
a
scheme
on
and
i
hope
you
join
in
with
me
tell
you
when
i
see
it
happened
that
merriman
was
not
engaged
that
evening
and
shortly
after
ten
the
two
men
were
occupying
the
same
at
the
same
open
window
their
glasses
within
easy
reach
and
their
cigars
well
under
way
and
what
is
your
great
idea
merriman
asked
when
they
had
conversed
for
a
few
moments
if
it
as
good
as
your
cigars
i
hilliard
moved
nervously
as
if
he
found
a
difficulty
in
replying
merriman
could
see
that
he
was
excited
and
his
own
interest
quickened
it
about
that
tale
of
yours
hilliard
said
at
length
i
been
thinking
it
he
paused
as
if
in
doubt
merriman
felt
like
alice
when
she
had
heard
the
story
but
he
waited
in
silence
and
presently
hilliard
went
on
you
told
it
with
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
he
said
you
suggested
you
might
be
mistaken
in
thinking
there
was
anything
in
it
now
i
going
to
make
a
suggestion
with
even
more
hesitation
for
ten
times
wilder
than
yours
and
there
is
simply
nothing
to
back
it
up
but
here
goes
all
the
his
indecision
had
passed
now
and
he
went
on
fluently
and
with
a
certain
excitement
here
you
have
a
trade
with
something
fishy
about
it
perhaps
you
think
that
putting
it
too
strongly
if
so
let
us
say
there
is
something
peculiar
about
it
something
at
all
events
to
call
one
attention
to
it
as
being
in
some
way
out
of
the
common
and
when
we
do
think
about
it
what
the
first
thing
we
discover
hilliard
looked
inquiringly
at
his
friend
the
latter
sat
listening
carefully
but
did
not
speak
and
hilliard
answered
his
own
question
why
that
it
an
export
trade
from
france
to
england
an
export
trade
only
mind
you
as
far
as
you
learned
these
people
boat
runs
the
to
england
but
carries
nothing
back
is
that
so
they
did
mention
return
cargoes
merriman
answered
but
that
does
mean
there
are
any
i
did
not
go
into
the
thing
but
what
could
there
be
what
possible
thing
could
be
shipped
in
bulk
from
this
country
to
the
middle
of
a
wood
near
bordeaux
something
mind
you
that
you
there
at
the
very
place
did
see
can
you
think
of
anything
not
at
the
moment
but
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
quite
possibly
nothing
and
yet
it
an
interesting
do
see
well
look
here
i
been
making
inquiries
and
i
find
most
of
our
come
from
norway
and
the
baltic
but
the
ships
that
bring
them
do
go
back
empty
they
carry
coal
now
do
you
see
it
was
becoming
evident
that
hilliard
was
talking
of
something
quite
definite
and
merriman
interest
increased
still
further
i
daresay
i
a
frightful
ass
he
said
but
i
blessed
if
i
know
what
you
driving
costs
hilliard
returned
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
costs
timber
in
norway
is
as
plentiful
and
as
cheap
to
cut
as
in
the
landes
indeed
possibly
cheaper
for
there
is
water
there
available
for
power
but
your
freight
will
be
much
less
if
you
can
get
a
return
cargo
therefore
a
priori
it
should
be
cheaper
to
bring
props
from
norway
than
from
france
do
you
follow
me
so
far
merriman
nodded
if
it
costs
the
same
amount
to
cut
the
props
at
each
place
hilliard
resumed
and
the
norwegian
freight
is
lower
the
norwegian
props
must
be
cheaper
in
england
how
then
do
your
friends
make
it
pay
methods
more
up
to
date
perhaps
things
looked
efficient
and
that
manager
seemed
pretty
hilliard
shook
his
head
perhaps
but
i
doubt
it
i
do
think
you
have
much
to
teach
the
norwegians
about
the
export
of
timber
mind
you
it
may
be
all
right
but
it
seems
to
me
a
question
if
the
bordeaux
people
have
a
paying
merriman
was
puzzled
but
it
must
pay
or
they
would
go
on
with
it
coburn
said
it
was
paying
well
hilliard
bent
forward
eagerly
of
course
he
would
say
so
he
cried
do
you
see
that
his
saying
so
is
in
itself
suspicious
why
should
he
want
to
tell
you
that
if
there
was
nothing
to
make
you
doubt
it
there
is
nothing
to
make
me
doubt
it
see
here
hilliard
i
do
for
the
life
of
me
know
what
you
getting
at
for
the
lord
sake
explain
ah
hilliard
returned
with
a
smile
you
see
you
were
brought
up
in
the
customs
do
you
know
merriman
that
the
thing
of
all
others
keenest
on
is
an
import
trade
that
does
pay
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
slowly
because
if
a
trade
which
does
pay
is
continued
there
must
be
something
else
to
make
it
pay
just
think
merriman
what
would
make
a
trade
from
france
to
this
country
pay
merriman
gasped
by
jove
hilliard
you
mean
smuggling
hilliard
laughed
delightedly
of
course
i
mean
smuggling
what
else
he
waited
for
the
idea
to
sink
into
his
companion
brain
and
then
went
on
and
now
another
thing
bordeaux
as
no
one
knows
better
than
yourself
is
just
the
center
of
the
brandy
district
you
see
what
i
getting
at
my
department
would
naturally
be
interested
in
a
mysterious
trade
from
the
bordeaux
district
you
accidentally
find
one
see
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
do
think
much
of
it
merriman
answered
sharply
while
a
wave
of
unreasoning
anger
passed
over
him
the
suggestion
annoyed
him
unaccountably
the
vision
of
madeleine
coburn
clear
honest
eyes
returned
forcibly
to
his
recollection
i
afraid
you
out
of
it
this
time
if
you
had
seen
miss
coburn
you
would
have
known
she
is
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
lend
herself
to
anything
of
that
hilliard
eyed
his
friend
narrowly
and
with
some
surprise
but
he
only
said
you
think
not
well
perhaps
you
are
right
you
seen
her
and
i
have
but
those
two
points
are
at
least
interesting
the
changing
of
the
numbers
and
the
absence
of
a
return
i
do
believe
there
anything
in
probably
you
right
but
the
idea
interests
me
i
was
going
to
make
a
proposal
but
i
expect
now
you
wo
agree
to
merriman
momentary
annoyance
was
subsiding
let
hear
it
anyway
old
man
he
said
in
conciliatory
tones
you
get
your
holidays
shortly
do
you
monday
week
my
partner
is
away
now
but
he
be
back
on
wednesday
i
go
i
thought
so
i
going
on
mine
next
week
taking
the
motor
launch
you
know
i
had
made
plans
for
the
riviera
to
go
by
the
seine
and
from
there
by
canal
to
the
rhone
and
out
at
marseilles
higginson
was
coming
with
me
but
as
you
know
he
crocked
up
and
wo
be
out
of
bed
for
a
month
my
proposal
is
that
you
come
in
his
place
and
that
instead
of
crossing
france
in
the
orthodox
way
by
the
seine
we
try
to
work
through
from
bordeaux
by
the
garonne
i
do
know
if
we
can
do
it
but
it
would
be
rather
fun
trying
but
anyway
the
point
would
be
that
we
should
pay
a
call
at
your
sawmill
on
the
way
and
see
if
we
can
learn
anything
more
about
the
lorry
numbers
what
do
you
say
sounds
jolly
merriman
had
quite
recovered
his
good
humor
but
i
not
a
yachtsman
i
know
nothing
about
the
pooh
what
do
you
want
to
know
we
not
sailing
and
motoring
through
these
rivers
and
canals
is
great
sport
and
then
we
can
go
on
to
monte
and
any
of
those
places
you
like
i
done
it
before
and
had
no
end
of
a
good
time
what
do
you
say
are
you
on
it
jolly
decent
of
you
i
sure
hilliard
if
you
think
you
can
put
up
with
a
hopeless
landlubber
i
certainly
merriman
was
surprised
to
find
how
much
he
was
thrilled
by
the
proposal
he
enjoyed
boating
though
only
very
mildly
and
it
was
certainly
not
the
prospect
of
endless
journeyings
along
the
canals
and
rivers
of
france
that
attracted
him
still
less
was
it
the
sea
of
which
he
hated
the
motion
nor
was
it
the
question
of
the
lorry
numbers
he
was
puzzled
and
interested
in
the
affair
and
he
would
like
to
know
the
solution
but
his
curiosity
was
not
desperately
keen
and
he
did
not
feel
like
taking
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
satisfy
it
at
all
events
he
was
not
going
to
do
any
spying
if
that
was
what
hilliard
wanted
for
he
did
not
for
a
moment
accept
that
smuggling
theory
but
when
they
were
in
the
neighborhood
he
supposed
it
would
be
permissible
to
call
and
see
the
coburns
miss
coburn
had
seemed
lonely
it
would
be
decent
to
try
to
cheer
her
up
they
might
invite
her
on
board
and
have
tea
and
perhaps
a
run
up
the
river
he
seemed
to
visualize
the
launch
moving
easily
between
the
banks
hilliard
attending
to
the
engine
and
steering
he
and
the
girl
in
the
taffrail
or
the
cockpit
or
the
well
or
whatever
you
sat
in
on
a
motor
boat
he
pictured
a
gloriously
sunny
afternoon
warm
and
delightful
with
just
enough
air
made
by
the
movement
to
prevent
it
being
too
hot
it
would
hilliard
voice
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
and
he
realized
his
friend
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
she
if
anything
he
was
saying
but
that
all
to
the
good
for
emergencies
i
got
fifteen
knots
out
of
her
once
but
she
averages
about
twelve
and
good
in
a
too
for
her
size
as
dry
a
boat
as
ever
i
was
what
size
is
she
asked
merriman
thirty
feet
eight
feet
beam
draws
two
feet
ten
she
go
down
any
of
the
french
canals
two
engines
either
of
which
will
run
her
engines
and
wheel
amidships
cabin
aft
decked
over
oh
she
a
beauty
you
like
her
i
can
tell
but
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
would
cross
the
bay
of
biscay
in
a
boat
that
size
the
bay
maligned
i
been
across
it
six
times
and
it
was
only
rough
once
of
course
i
keep
near
the
coast
and
run
for
shelter
if
it
came
on
to
blow
you
need
not
worry
she
as
safe
as
a
i
not
worrying
about
her
going
to
the
bottom
merriman
answered
it
much
worse
than
that
the
fact
is
he
went
on
in
a
burst
of
confidence
i
ca
stand
the
motion
i
ill
all
the
time
could
i
join
you
later
hilliard
nodded
i
had
that
in
my
mind
but
i
did
like
to
suggest
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
suit
me
better
you
see
i
go
on
my
holidays
a
week
earlier
than
you
i
do
want
to
hang
about
all
that
time
waiting
for
you
i
get
a
man
and
take
the
boat
over
to
bordeaux
send
the
man
home
and
you
can
come
overland
and
join
me
there
how
would
that
suit
you
hilliard
nothing
could
be
they
continued
discussing
details
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
and
when
merriman
left
for
home
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
should
follow
hilliard
by
the
night
train
from
charing
cross
on
the
following
monday
week
chapter
the
start
of
the
cruise
dusk
was
already
falling
when
the
continental
pulled
out
of
charing
cross
with
seymour
merriman
in
the
corner
of
a
compartment
it
had
been
a
glorious
day
of
clear
atmosphere
and
brilliant
sunshine
and
there
was
every
prospect
of
a
spell
of
good
weather
now
as
the
train
rumbled
over
the
bridge
at
the
end
of
the
station
sky
and
river
presented
a
gorgeous
color
scheme
of
crimson
and
pink
and
gold
shading
off
through
violet
and
gray
to
nearly
black
through
the
latticing
of
the
girders
the
great
buildings
on
the
northern
bank
showed
up
for
a
moment
against
the
light
beyond
dark
and
somber
masses
with
nicked
and
serrated
tops
then
the
river
crossed
nearer
buildings
intervened
to
cut
off
the
view
and
the
train
plunged
into
the
maze
and
wilderness
of
south
london
the
little
pleasurable
excitement
which
merriman
had
experienced
when
first
the
trip
had
been
suggested
had
not
waned
as
the
novelty
of
the
idea
passed
not
since
he
was
a
boy
at
school
had
he
looked
forward
so
keenly
to
holidays
the
launch
for
one
thing
would
be
a
new
experience
he
had
never
been
on
any
kind
of
cruise
the
nearest
approach
had
been
a
couple
of
days
yachting
on
the
norfolk
broads
but
he
had
found
that
monotonous
and
boring
and
had
been
glad
when
it
was
over
but
this
he
expected
would
be
different
he
delighted
in
poking
about
abroad
not
in
the
great
cosmopolitan
hotels
which
after
all
are
very
much
the
same
all
the
world
over
but
where
he
came
in
contact
with
actual
foreign
life
and
how
better
could
a
country
be
seen
than
by
slowly
motoring
through
its
waterways
merriman
was
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
and
then
there
would
be
hilliard
merriman
had
always
enjoyed
his
company
and
he
felt
he
would
be
an
ideal
companion
on
a
tour
it
was
true
hilliard
had
got
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
about
this
lorry
affair
merriman
was
mildly
interested
in
the
thing
but
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
going
back
to
the
sawmill
to
investigate
but
hilliard
seemed
quite
excited
about
it
his
attitude
no
doubt
might
be
partly
explained
by
his
love
of
puzzles
and
mysteries
perhaps
also
he
half
believed
in
his
absurd
suggestion
about
the
smuggling
or
at
least
felt
that
if
it
were
true
there
was
the
chance
of
his
making
some
coup
which
would
also
make
his
name
how
a
man
occupation
colors
his
mind
thought
merriman
here
was
hilliard
and
because
he
was
in
the
customs
his
ideas
ran
to
customs
operations
and
when
he
came
across
anything
he
did
not
understand
he
at
once
suggested
smuggling
if
he
had
been
a
soldier
he
would
have
guessed
and
if
a
politician
a
means
of
bringing
anarchist
literature
into
the
country
well
he
had
not
seen
madeleine
coburn
he
would
soon
drop
so
absurd
a
notion
when
he
had
met
her
the
idea
of
her
being
party
to
such
a
thing
was
too
ridiculous
even
to
be
annoying
however
hilliard
insisted
on
going
to
the
mill
and
he
merriman
could
then
pay
that
call
on
the
coburns
it
would
not
be
polite
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
and
not
do
so
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
call
without
asking
miss
coburn
to
come
on
the
river
as
the
train
rumbled
on
through
the
rapidly
darkening
country
merriman
began
once
again
to
picture
the
details
of
that
excursion
no
doubt
they
could
have
tea
on
board
he
must
forget
to
buy
some
decent
cakes
in
bordeaux
perhaps
she
would
help
him
to
get
it
ready
while
hilliard
steered
and
pottered
over
his
old
engines
he
could
just
imagine
her
bending
over
a
tea
tray
her
graceful
figure
the
little
brown
tendrils
of
her
hair
at
the
edge
of
her
her
brown
eyes
flashing
up
to
meet
his
own
dover
came
unexpectedly
soon
and
merriman
had
to
postpone
the
further
consideration
of
his
plans
until
he
had
gone
on
board
the
boat
and
settled
down
in
a
corner
of
the
smoker
room
there
however
he
fell
asleep
not
awaking
until
roused
by
the
bustle
of
the
arrival
in
calais
he
reached
paris
just
before
six
and
drove
to
the
gare
where
he
had
time
for
a
bath
and
breakfast
before
catching
the
express
for
bordeaux
again
it
was
a
perfect
day
and
as
the
hours
passed
and
they
ran
steadily
southward
through
the
pleasing
but
monotonous
central
plain
of
france
the
heat
grew
more
and
more
oppressive
poitiers
was
hot
angouleme
an
oven
and
merriman
was
not
sorry
when
at
a
quarter
to
five
they
came
in
sight
of
the
garonne
at
the
outskirts
of
bordeaux
and
a
few
moments
later
pulled
up
in
the
bastide
station
hilliard
was
waiting
at
the
platform
barrier
hallo
old
man
he
cried
jolly
to
see
you
give
me
one
of
your
handbags
i
got
a
taxi
merriman
handed
over
the
smaller
of
the
two
small
suitcases
he
carried
having
in
deference
to
hilliard
warnings
left
behind
most
of
the
things
he
wanted
to
bring
they
found
the
taxi
and
drove
out
at
once
across
the
great
stone
bridge
leading
from
the
bastide
station
and
suburb
on
the
east
bank
to
the
main
city
on
the
west
in
front
of
them
lay
the
huge
concave
sweep
of
quays
fronting
the
garonne
here
a
river
of
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
width
with
behind
the
massed
buildings
of
the
town
out
of
which
here
and
there
rose
church
spires
and
farther
the
three
imposing
columns
of
the
place
des
quinconces
some
river
this
merriman
said
looking
up
and
down
the
great
sweep
of
water
rather
i
have
the
swallow
a
private
wharf
farther
rather
old
shanty
but
it
easier
than
mooring
in
the
stream
and
rowing
out
we
go
and
leave
your
things
aboard
and
then
we
can
come
up
town
again
and
get
some
merriman
agreed
having
crossed
the
bridge
they
turned
to
the
left
upstream
and
ran
along
the
quays
towards
the
south
after
passing
the
railway
bridge
the
taxi
swung
down
towards
the
water
edge
stopping
at
a
somewhat
decrepit
enclosure
over
the
gate
of
which
was
the
legend
andre
leblanc
location
de
hilliard
jumped
out
paid
the
taxi
man
and
followed
by
merriman
entered
the
enclosure
it
was
a
small
place
with
a
wooden
quay
along
the
river
frontage
and
a
shed
at
the
opposite
side
between
the
two
lay
a
number
of
boats
trade
appeared
to
be
bad
for
there
was
no
life
about
the
place
and
everything
was
dirty
and
decaying
there
she
is
hilliard
cried
with
a
ring
of
pride
in
his
voice
is
she
a
beauty
the
swallow
was
tied
up
alongside
the
wharf
her
bow
upstream
and
lay
tugging
at
her
mooring
ropes
in
the
swift
run
of
the
ebb
tide
merriman
first
glance
at
her
was
one
of
disappointment
he
had
pictured
a
graceful
craft
of
wood
with
white
deck
planks
shining
brasswork
and
cushioned
seats
instead
he
saw
a
boat
painted
where
the
paint
was
not
worn
off
a
sickly
greenish
white
and
giving
a
general
impression
of
dirt
and
want
of
attention
she
was
and
sat
high
in
the
water
with
a
freeboard
of
nearly
five
feet
a
little
forward
of
amidships
was
a
small
deck
cabin
containing
a
brass
wheel
and
binnacle
aft
of
the
cabin
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
of
the
deck
was
a
skylight
the
top
of
which
formed
two
short
seats
placed
back
to
back
forward
rose
a
stumpy
mast
carrying
a
lantern
cage
near
the
top
and
still
farther
forward
almost
in
the
bows
lay
an
unexpectedly
massive
anchor
housed
in
grids
with
behind
it
a
small
hand
winch
for
pulling
in
the
chain
we
had
a
bit
of
a
blow
coming
round
the
coubre
into
the
river
hilliard
went
on
enthusiastically
and
i
tell
you
she
did
ship
a
pint
the
cabin
bone
dry
and
green
water
coming
over
her
all
the
merriman
could
believe
it
though
his
temporary
home
was
not
beautiful
he
could
see
that
she
was
strong
in
fact
she
was
massive
but
he
thanked
his
stars
he
had
not
assisted
in
the
test
he
shuddered
at
the
very
idea
thinking
gratefully
that
to
reach
bordeaux
the
railway
was
good
enough
for
him
but
realizing
it
was
expected
of
him
he
began
praising
the
boat
until
the
unsuspecting
hilliard
believed
him
as
enthusiastic
as
himself
yes
she
all
of
that
he
agreed
come
aboard
and
see
the
they
descended
a
flight
of
steps
let
into
the
front
of
the
wharf
wet
slippery
steps
left
bare
by
the
receding
tide
and
stepping
over
the
side
entered
the
tiny
deckhouse
this
is
the
shelter
and
all
in
one
hilliard
explained
all
the
engine
controls
come
up
here
and
i
can
reach
them
with
my
left
hand
while
steering
with
my
he
demonstrated
as
he
spoke
and
merriman
could
not
but
agree
that
the
arrangements
were
wonderfully
compact
and
efficient
come
below
now
went
on
the
proud
owner
disappearing
down
a
steep
flight
of
steps
against
one
wall
of
the
house
the
hull
was
divided
into
three
compartments
amidships
the
engine
room
with
its
twin
engines
forward
a
store
containing
among
other
things
a
collapsible
boat
and
aft
a
cabin
with
lockers
on
each
side
a
folding
table
between
them
and
a
cupboard
on
which
was
a
primus
stove
the
woodwork
was
painted
the
same
greenish
white
as
the
outside
but
it
was
soiled
and
dingy
and
the
whole
place
looked
dirty
and
untidy
there
was
a
smell
of
various
oils
paraffin
predominating
you
take
the
port
locker
hilliard
explained
you
see
the
top
of
it
lifts
and
you
can
stow
your
things
in
it
when
there
are
only
two
of
us
we
sleep
on
the
lockers
you
find
a
sheet
and
blankets
inside
there
a
board
underneath
that
turns
up
to
keep
you
in
if
rolling
not
that
we
shall
want
it
until
we
get
to
the
mediterranean
i
afraid
he
went
on
answering
merriman
unspoken
thought
the
place
is
not
very
tidy
i
had
time
to
do
much
squaring
i
tell
you
about
that
later
i
suppose
reluctantly
we
had
better
turn
to
and
clean
up
a
bit
before
we
go
to
bed
but
brightening
up
again
not
now
let
go
up
town
and
get
some
dinner
as
soon
as
you
are
he
fussed
about
explaining
with
the
loving
and
painstaking
minuteness
of
the
designer
as
well
as
the
owner
the
various
contraptions
the
boat
contained
and
when
he
had
finished
merriman
felt
that
could
he
but
remember
his
instructions
there
were
few
situations
with
which
he
could
not
cope
or
by
which
he
could
be
taken
unawares
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
friends
climbed
once
more
up
the
slippery
steps
and
strolling
slowly
up
the
town
entered
one
of
the
large
restaurants
in
the
place
de
la
comedie
since
merriman
arrival
hilliard
had
talked
vivaciously
and
his
thin
face
had
seemed
even
more
eager
than
the
wine
merchant
had
ever
before
seen
it
at
first
the
latter
had
put
it
down
to
the
natural
interest
of
his
own
arrival
the
showing
of
the
boat
to
a
and
the
start
of
the
cruise
generally
but
as
dinner
progressed
he
began
to
feel
there
must
be
some
more
tangible
cause
for
the
excitement
his
friend
was
so
obviously
feeling
it
was
not
merriman
habit
to
beat
about
the
bush
what
is
it
he
asked
during
a
pause
in
the
conversation
what
is
what
returned
hilliard
looking
uncomprehendingly
at
his
friend
wrong
with
you
here
you
are
jumping
about
as
if
you
were
on
pins
and
needles
and
gabbling
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
words
a
minute
all
the
excitement
about
i
not
excited
hilliard
returned
seriously
but
i
admit
being
a
little
interested
by
what
has
happened
since
we
parted
that
night
in
london
i
have
told
you
yet
i
was
waiting
until
we
had
finished
dinner
and
could
settle
down
let
go
and
sit
in
the
jardin
and
you
shall
leaving
the
restaurant
they
strolled
to
the
place
des
quinconces
crossed
it
and
entered
the
jardin
public
the
band
was
not
playing
and
though
there
were
a
number
of
people
about
the
place
was
by
no
means
crowded
and
they
were
able
to
find
under
a
large
tree
set
back
a
little
from
one
of
the
walks
two
vacant
chairs
here
they
sat
down
enjoying
the
soft
evening
air
warm
but
no
longer
too
warm
and
watching
the
promenading
bordelais
yes
hilliard
resumed
as
he
lit
a
cigar
i
have
had
quite
an
interesting
time
you
shall
hear
i
got
hold
of
maxwell
of
the
telephones
who
is
a
yachtsman
and
who
was
going
to
spain
on
holidays
well
the
boat
was
laid
up
at
southampton
and
we
got
down
about
midday
on
monday
week
we
spent
that
day
overhauling
her
and
getting
in
stores
and
on
tuesday
we
ran
down
channel
putting
into
dartmouth
for
the
night
and
to
fill
with
petrol
next
day
was
our
big
day
across
to
brest
something
like
miles
mostly
open
sea
and
with
ushant
at
the
end
of
it
a
beastly
place
generally
foggy
and
always
with
bad
currents
we
intended
to
wait
in
the
dart
for
good
weather
and
we
wired
the
meteorological
office
for
forecasts
it
happened
that
on
tuesday
night
there
was
a
forecast
so
on
wednesday
we
decided
to
risk
it
we
slipped
out
past
the
old
castle
at
dartmouth
at
had
a
topping
run
and
were
in
brest
at
seven
that
evening
there
we
filled
up
again
and
next
day
thursday
we
made
nazaire
at
the
mouth
of
the
loire
we
had
intended
to
make
a
long
day
of
it
on
friday
and
come
right
here
but
as
i
told
you
it
came
on
to
blow
a
bit
off
the
coubre
and
we
could
only
make
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
put
into
a
little
place
called
le
verdon
just
inside
the
pointe
de
grave
that
the
end
of
that
fork
of
land
on
the
southern
side
of
the
gironde
estuary
on
saturday
we
got
here
about
midday
hunted
around
found
that
old
wharf
and
moored
maxwell
went
on
the
same
evening
to
hilliard
paused
while
merriman
congratulated
him
on
his
journey
yes
we
had
bad
luck
he
resumed
but
that
really
was
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
i
had
brought
a
fishing
rod
and
outfit
and
on
sunday
i
took
a
car
and
drove
out
along
the
bayonne
road
until
i
came
to
your
bridge
over
that
river
the
lesque
i
find
it
is
i
told
the
chap
to
come
back
for
me
at
six
and
i
walked
down
the
river
and
did
a
bit
of
prospecting
the
works
were
shut
and
by
keeping
the
mill
building
between
me
and
the
manager
house
i
got
close
up
and
had
a
good
look
round
unobserved
at
least
i
think
i
was
unobserved
well
i
must
say
the
whole
business
looked
genuine
there
no
question
those
tree
cuttings
are
and
i
could
see
a
single
thing
in
the
slightest
degree
i
told
you
there
could
be
nothing
really
wrong
merriman
interjected
i
know
you
did
but
wait
a
minute
i
got
back
to
the
forest
again
in
the
shelter
of
the
mill
building
and
i
walked
around
through
the
trees
and
chose
a
place
for
what
i
wanted
to
do
next
morning
i
had
decided
to
spend
the
day
watching
the
lorries
going
to
and
from
the
works
and
i
naturally
wished
to
remain
unobserved
myself
the
wood
as
you
know
is
very
open
the
trees
are
thick
but
there
is
very
little
undergrowth
and
it
nearly
impossible
to
get
decent
cover
but
at
last
i
found
a
little
hollow
with
a
mound
between
it
and
the
lane
and
road
just
a
mere
irregularity
in
the
surface
like
what
a
tommy
would
make
when
he
began
to
dig
himself
in
i
thought
i
could
lie
there
unobserved
and
see
what
went
on
with
my
glass
i
have
a
very
good
prism
monocular
diameter
magnification
with
a
splendid
definition
from
my
hollow
i
could
just
see
through
the
trees
vehicles
passing
along
the
main
road
but
i
had
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
lane
for
at
least
half
its
length
the
view
of
course
was
broken
by
the
stems
but
still
i
should
be
able
to
tell
if
any
games
were
tried
on
i
made
some
innocent
looking
markings
so
as
to
find
the
place
again
and
then
went
back
to
the
river
and
so
to
the
bridge
and
my
hilliard
paused
and
drew
at
his
cigar
merriman
did
not
speak
he
was
leaning
forward
his
face
showing
the
interest
he
felt
next
morning
that
was
yesterday
i
took
another
taxi
and
returned
to
the
bridge
again
dressed
as
a
fisherman
i
had
brought
some
lunch
and
i
told
the
man
to
return
for
me
at
seven
in
the
evening
then
i
found
my
hollow
lay
down
and
got
out
my
glass
i
was
settled
there
a
little
before
nine
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
wood
i
could
hear
faintly
the
noise
of
the
saws
at
the
mill
and
a
few
birds
were
singing
otherwise
it
was
perfectly
still
nothing
happened
for
about
half
an
hour
then
the
first
lorry
came
i
heard
it
for
some
time
before
i
saw
it
it
passed
very
slowly
along
the
road
from
bordeaux
then
turned
into
the
lane
and
went
along
it
at
almost
walking
pace
with
my
glass
i
could
see
it
distinctly
and
it
had
a
label
plate
same
as
you
described
and
was
no
it
was
empty
the
driver
was
a
young
man
and
fairhaired
a
few
minutes
later
a
second
empty
lorry
appeared
coming
from
bordeaux
it
was
no
and
the
driver
was
i
am
sure
the
man
you
saw
he
was
like
your
description
of
him
at
all
events
this
lorry
also
passed
along
the
lane
towards
the
works
there
was
a
pause
then
for
an
hour
or
more
about
ten
the
no
lorry
with
your
friend
appeared
coming
along
the
lane
outward
bound
it
was
heavily
loaded
with
firewood
and
i
followed
it
along
going
very
slowly
and
bumping
over
the
inequalities
of
the
lane
when
it
got
to
a
point
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
road
at
i
afterwards
found
an
s
curve
which
cut
off
the
view
in
both
directions
it
stopped
and
the
driver
got
down
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
watched
him
carefully
and
merriman
what
do
you
think
i
saw
him
do
change
the
number
plate
suggested
merriman
with
a
smile
change
the
number
plate
repeated
hilliard
as
i
alive
exactly
what
he
did
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
he
changed
the
to
a
he
took
the
plates
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
the
plates
back
instead
and
the
whole
thing
just
took
a
couple
of
seconds
as
if
the
plates
slipped
in
and
out
of
a
holder
then
he
hopped
up
into
his
place
again
and
started
off
what
do
you
think
of
that
goodness
only
knows
merriman
returned
slowly
an
extraordinary
is
it
well
that
lorry
went
on
out
of
sight
i
waited
there
until
after
six
and
four
more
passed
about
eleven
no
with
the
driver
passed
out
loaded
so
far
as
i
could
see
with
firewood
that
was
the
one
that
passed
in
empty
at
nine
then
there
was
a
pause
until
half
past
two
when
your
friend
returned
with
his
lorry
it
was
empty
this
time
and
it
was
still
no
but
i
blessed
merriman
if
he
did
stop
at
the
same
place
and
change
the
number
back
to
lord
said
merriman
tersely
now
almost
as
much
interested
as
his
friend
it
only
took
a
couple
of
seconds
and
then
the
machine
lumbered
on
towards
the
mill
i
was
pretty
excited
i
can
tell
you
but
i
decided
to
sit
tight
and
await
developments
the
next
thing
was
the
return
of
no
lorry
and
the
driver
you
remember
it
had
started
out
loaded
at
about
eleven
it
came
back
empty
shortly
after
the
other
say
about
a
quarter
to
three
it
did
stop
and
there
was
no
change
made
with
its
number
then
there
was
another
pause
at
half
past
three
your
friend
came
out
again
with
another
load
this
time
he
was
driving
no
and
i
waited
to
see
him
stop
and
change
it
but
he
did
do
either
sailed
away
with
the
number
remaining
queer
is
it
merriman
nodded
and
hilliard
resumed
i
stayed
where
i
was
still
watching
but
i
saw
no
more
lorries
but
i
saw
miss
coburn
pass
about
ten
minutes
later
at
least
i
presume
it
was
miss
coburn
she
was
dressed
in
brown
and
was
walking
smartly
along
the
lane
towards
the
road
in
about
an
hour
she
passed
back
then
about
five
minutes
past
five
some
workmen
went
by
evidently
the
day
ends
at
five
i
waited
until
the
coast
was
clear
then
went
down
to
the
lane
and
had
a
look
round
where
the
lorry
had
stopped
and
saw
it
was
a
double
bend
and
therefore
the
most
hidden
point
i
walked
back
through
the
wood
to
the
bridge
picked
up
my
taxi
and
got
back
here
about
half
past
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
after
hilliard
ceased
speaking
then
merriman
asked
how
long
did
you
say
those
lorries
were
away
unloading
about
four
that
would
have
given
them
time
to
unload
in
bordeaux
yes
an
hour
and
a
half
the
same
out
and
an
hour
in
the
city
yes
that
part
of
it
is
evidently
right
again
silence
reigned
and
again
merriman
broke
it
with
a
question
you
have
no
theory
yourself
absolutely
do
you
think
that
driver
might
have
some
private
game
of
his
own
on
be
somehow
doing
the
syndicate
what
about
your
own
argument
answered
hilliard
is
it
likely
miss
coburn
would
join
the
driver
in
anything
shady
remember
your
impression
was
that
she
merriman
nodded
that
right
he
agreed
continuing
slowly
supposing
for
a
moment
it
was
smuggling
how
would
that
help
you
to
explain
this
affair
it
would
i
can
get
no
light
the
two
men
smoked
silently
each
busy
with
his
thoughts
a
certain
aspect
of
the
matter
which
had
always
lain
subconsciously
in
mind
was
gradually
taking
concrete
form
it
had
not
assumed
much
importance
when
the
two
friends
were
first
discussing
their
trip
but
now
that
they
were
actually
at
grips
with
the
affair
it
was
becoming
more
obtrusive
and
merriman
felt
it
must
be
faced
he
therefore
spoke
again
you
know
old
man
there
one
thing
i
not
quite
clear
about
this
affair
that
you
discovered
is
extraordinarily
interesting
and
all
that
but
i
hanged
if
i
can
see
what
business
of
ours
it
hilliard
nodded
swiftly
i
know
he
answered
quickly
the
same
thing
has
been
bothering
me
i
felt
really
mean
yesterday
when
that
girl
came
by
as
if
i
were
spying
on
her
you
know
i
would
care
to
do
it
again
but
i
want
to
go
on
to
this
place
and
see
into
the
thing
farther
and
so
do
i
do
know
that
i
do
we
both
do
hilliard
reiterated
firmly
and
we
both
justified
see
here
take
my
case
first
i
in
the
customs
department
and
it
is
part
of
my
job
to
investigate
suspicious
import
trades
am
i
not
justified
in
trying
to
find
out
if
smuggling
is
going
on
of
course
i
am
besides
merriman
i
ca
pretend
not
to
know
that
if
i
brought
such
a
thing
to
light
i
should
be
a
made
man
mind
you
we
not
out
to
do
these
people
any
harm
only
to
make
sure
they
not
harming
us
is
that
sound
that
may
be
all
right
for
you
but
i
ca
see
that
the
affair
is
any
business
of
i
think
it
hilliard
spoke
very
quietly
i
think
it
your
business
and
mine
the
business
of
any
decent
man
there
a
chance
that
miss
coburn
may
be
in
danger
we
should
make
merriman
sat
up
sharply
in
heaven
name
what
do
you
mean
hilliard
he
cried
fiercely
what
possible
danger
could
she
be
in
well
suppose
there
is
something
wrong
only
suppose
i
say
as
the
other
shook
his
head
impatiently
if
there
is
it
be
on
a
big
scale
and
therefore
the
men
who
run
it
wo
be
over
squeamish
again
if
there
anything
miss
coburn
knows
about
it
oh
yes
she
does
he
repeated
as
merriman
would
have
dissented
there
is
your
own
evidence
but
if
she
knows
about
some
large
shady
undertaking
she
undoubtedly
may
be
in
both
difficulty
and
danger
at
all
events
as
long
as
the
chance
exists
it
up
to
us
to
make
merriman
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
his
head
bent
and
a
frown
on
his
face
hilliard
took
no
notice
of
him
and
presently
he
came
back
and
sat
down
again
you
may
be
right
he
said
i
go
with
you
to
find
that
out
and
that
only
but
i
not
do
any
hilliard
was
satisfied
with
his
diplomacy
i
quite
see
your
point
he
said
smoothly
and
i
confess
i
think
you
are
right
we
go
and
take
a
look
round
and
if
we
find
things
are
all
right
we
come
away
again
and
there
no
harm
done
that
agreed
merriman
nodded
what
the
program
then
he
asked
i
think
tomorrow
we
should
take
the
boat
round
to
the
lesque
it
a
good
long
run
and
we
must
be
late
getting
away
would
five
be
too
early
for
you
five
no
i
do
mind
if
we
start
the
tide
begins
to
ebb
at
four
by
five
we
shall
get
the
best
of
its
run
we
should
be
out
of
the
river
by
nine
and
in
the
lesque
by
four
in
the
afternoon
though
that
mill
is
only
seventeen
miles
from
here
as
the
crow
flies
it
a
frightful
long
way
round
by
sea
most
of
miles
i
should
hilliard
looked
at
his
watch
eleven
well
what
about
going
back
to
the
swallow
and
turning
in
they
left
the
jardin
and
sauntering
slowly
through
the
streets
reached
the
launch
and
went
on
board
chapter
a
commercial
proposition
merriman
was
roused
next
morning
by
the
feeling
rather
than
the
sound
of
stealthy
movements
going
on
not
far
away
he
had
not
speedily
slept
after
turning
in
the
novelty
of
his
position
as
well
as
the
cramped
and
somewhat
knobby
bed
made
by
the
locker
and
the
smell
of
oils
had
made
him
restless
but
most
of
all
the
conversation
be
had
had
with
hilliard
had
banished
sleep
and
he
had
lain
thinking
over
the
adventure
to
which
they
had
committed
themselves
and
listening
to
the
little
murmurings
and
gurglings
of
the
water
running
past
the
piles
and
lapping
on
the
woodwork
beside
his
head
the
launch
kept
slightly
on
the
move
swinging
a
little
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
current
as
it
alternately
tightened
and
slackened
its
mooring
ropes
and
occasionally
quivering
gently
as
it
touched
the
wharf
three
separate
times
merriman
had
heard
the
hour
chimed
by
the
city
clocks
and
then
at
last
a
delightful
drowsiness
crept
over
him
and
consciousness
had
gradually
slipped
away
but
immediately
this
shuffling
had
begun
and
with
a
feeling
of
injury
he
roused
himself
to
learn
the
cause
opening
his
eyes
he
found
the
cabin
was
full
of
light
from
the
dancing
reflections
of
sunlit
waves
on
the
ceiling
and
that
hilliard
dressing
on
the
opposite
locker
was
the
author
of
the
sounds
which
had
disturbed
him
good
cried
the
latter
cheerily
you
awake
quarter
to
five
and
a
fine
could
be
merriman
returned
stretching
himself
luxuriously
i
heard
it
strike
two
not
ten
seconds
hilliard
laughed
well
it
time
we
were
under
way
anyhow
he
declared
tide
running
out
this
hour
we
get
a
fine
lift
down
to
the
merriman
got
up
and
peeped
out
of
the
porthole
above
his
locker
i
suppose
you
tub
over
the
side
he
inquired
lord
what
sunlight
rather
but
i
vote
we
wait
an
hour
or
so
until
we
clear
of
the
town
i
fancy
the
water
will
be
more
inviting
lower
down
we
could
stop
and
have
a
swim
and
then
we
should
be
ready
for
you
get
way
on
her
or
whatever
you
do
and
i
shall
have
a
shot
at
clearing
up
some
of
the
mess
you
keep
hilliard
left
the
cabin
and
presently
a
racketing
noise
and
vibration
announced
that
the
engines
had
been
started
this
presently
subsided
into
a
not
unpleasing
hum
after
which
a
hail
came
from
forward
lend
a
hand
to
cast
off
like
a
stout
merriman
hurriedly
completed
his
dressing
and
went
on
deck
stopping
in
spite
of
himself
to
look
around
before
attending
to
the
ropes
the
sun
was
low
down
over
the
opposite
bank
and
transformed
the
whole
river
down
to
the
railway
bridge
into
a
sheet
of
blinding
light
only
the
southern
end
of
the
great
structure
was
visible
stretching
out
of
the
radiance
as
well
as
the
houses
on
the
western
bank
but
these
showed
out
with
incredible
sharpness
in
high
lights
and
dark
shadows
from
where
they
were
lying
they
could
not
see
the
great
curve
of
the
quays
and
the
town
in
spite
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
atmosphere
looked
drab
and
unattractive
going
to
be
hot
hilliard
remarked
the
bow
first
if
you
he
started
the
screw
and
kept
the
launch
alongside
the
wharf
while
merriman
cast
off
first
the
bow
and
then
the
stern
ropes
then
steering
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
he
swung
round
and
they
began
to
slip
rapidly
downstream
with
the
current
after
passing
beneath
the
huge
mass
of
the
railway
bridge
they
got
a
better
view
of
the
city
its
rather
unimposing
buildings
clustering
on
the
great
curve
of
the
river
to
the
left
and
with
the
fine
stone
bridge
over
which
they
had
driven
on
the
previous
evening
stretching
across
from
bank
to
bank
in
front
of
them
slipping
through
one
of
its
seventeen
arches
they
passed
the
long
lines
of
quays
with
their
attendant
shipping
until
gradually
the
houses
got
thinner
and
they
reached
the
country
beyond
about
a
dozen
miles
below
the
town
hilliard
shut
off
the
engines
and
when
the
launch
had
come
to
rest
on
the
swift
current
they
had
a
glorious
dip
in
turn
then
the
odor
of
hot
ham
mingled
in
the
cabin
with
those
of
paraffin
and
burned
petrol
and
they
had
an
even
more
glorious
breakfast
finally
the
engines
were
restarted
and
they
pressed
steadily
down
the
estuary
about
nine
they
got
their
first
glimpse
of
the
sea
horizon
and
shortly
after
a
slight
heave
gave
merriman
a
foretaste
of
what
he
must
soon
expect
the
sea
was
like
a
mill
pond
but
as
they
came
out
from
behind
the
pointe
de
grave
they
began
to
feel
the
effect
of
the
long
slow
ocean
swell
as
soon
as
he
dared
hilliard
turned
southwards
along
the
coast
this
brought
the
swells
abeam
but
so
large
were
they
in
relation
to
the
launch
that
she
hardly
rolled
but
was
raised
and
lowered
bodily
on
an
almost
even
keel
though
merriman
was
not
actually
ill
he
was
acutely
unhappy
and
experienced
a
thrill
of
thanksgiving
when
about
five
they
swung
round
east
and
entered
the
estuary
of
the
lesque
must
go
slowly
here
hilliard
explained
as
the
banks
began
to
draw
together
there
no
sailing
chart
of
this
river
and
we
shall
have
to
feel
our
way
for
some
two
miles
they
passed
through
a
belt
of
sand
dunes
great
yellow
hillocks
shaded
with
dark
green
where
grasses
had
seized
a
precarious
foothold
behind
these
the
country
grew
flatter
and
small
shrubs
began
to
appear
all
leaning
eastwards
in
witness
of
the
devastating
winds
which
blew
in
from
the
sea
farther
on
these
gave
place
to
stunted
trees
and
by
the
time
they
had
gone
ten
or
twelve
miles
they
were
in
the
pine
forest
presently
they
passed
under
a
girder
bridge
carrying
the
railway
from
bordeaux
to
bayonne
and
the
south
we
ca
be
far
from
the
mill
now
said
hilliard
a
little
later
i
reckoned
it
must
be
about
three
miles
above
the
they
were
creeping
up
very
slowly
against
the
current
the
engines
running
easily
were
making
only
a
subdued
murmur
inaudible
at
any
considerable
distance
the
stream
here
was
narrow
not
more
than
about
a
hundred
yards
across
and
the
tall
pines
grew
down
to
the
water
edge
on
either
side
already
though
it
was
only
seven
it
was
growing
dusk
in
the
narrow
channel
and
hilliard
was
beginning
to
consider
the
question
of
moorings
for
the
night
we
go
round
that
next
bend
he
decided
and
look
for
a
place
to
some
five
minutes
later
they
steered
close
in
against
a
rapidly
shelving
bit
of
bank
and
silently
lowered
the
anchor
some
twenty
feet
from
the
margin
jove
i
glad
to
have
that
anchor
down
hilliard
remarked
stretching
himself
here
eight
and
we
been
at
it
since
five
this
morning
let
have
supper
and
a
pipe
and
then
we
discuss
our
and
what
are
your
plans
merriman
asked
when
an
hour
later
they
were
lying
on
their
lockers
hilliard
with
his
pipe
and
merriman
with
a
cigar
tomorrow
i
thought
of
going
up
in
the
collapsible
boat
until
i
came
to
the
works
then
landing
on
the
other
bank
and
watching
what
goes
on
at
the
mill
i
thought
of
taking
my
glass
and
keeping
cover
myself
after
what
you
said
last
night
you
probably
wo
care
to
come
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
if
you
cared
to
fish
you
would
find
everything
you
wanted
in
that
forward
locker
in
the
evening
we
could
meet
here
and
i
would
tell
you
if
i
saw
anything
merriman
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
and
sat
up
on
the
locker
look
here
old
man
he
said
i
sorry
i
was
a
bit
ratty
last
night
i
do
know
what
came
over
me
i
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
and
i
agree
that
your
view
is
the
right
one
i
decided
that
if
have
me
i
in
this
thing
until
we
both
satisfied
there
nothing
going
to
hurt
either
miss
coburn
or
our
own
hilliard
sprang
to
his
feet
and
held
out
his
hand
cheers
he
cried
i
jolly
glad
you
feel
that
way
that
all
i
want
to
do
too
but
i
ca
pretend
my
motives
are
altogether
disinterested
just
think
of
the
kudos
for
us
both
if
there
should
be
i
should
build
too
much
on
i
not
but
there
is
always
the
next
morning
the
two
friends
got
out
the
collapsible
boat
locked
up
the
launch
and
paddling
gently
up
the
river
until
the
galvanized
gable
of
the
coburns
house
came
in
sight
through
the
trees
went
ashore
on
the
opposite
bank
the
boat
they
took
to
pieces
and
hid
under
a
fallen
trunk
then
screened
by
the
trees
they
continued
their
way
on
foot
it
was
still
not
much
after
seven
another
exquisitely
clear
morning
giving
promise
of
more
heat
the
wood
was
silent
though
there
was
a
faint
stir
of
life
all
around
them
the
hum
of
invisible
insects
the
distant
singing
of
birds
as
well
as
the
murmur
of
the
flowing
water
their
footsteps
fell
soft
on
the
carpet
of
scant
grass
and
decaying
pine
needles
there
seemed
a
hush
over
everything
as
if
they
were
wandering
amid
the
pillars
of
some
vast
cathedral
with
instead
of
incense
the
aromatic
smell
of
the
pines
in
their
nostrils
they
walked
on
repressing
the
desire
to
step
on
tiptoe
until
through
the
trees
they
could
see
across
the
river
the
galvanized
iron
of
the
shed
a
little
bit
higher
the
clearing
of
the
trees
had
allowed
some
stunted
shrubs
to
cluster
on
the
river
bank
these
appearing
to
offer
good
cover
the
two
men
crawled
forward
and
took
up
a
position
in
their
shelter
the
bank
they
were
on
was
at
that
point
slightly
higher
than
on
the
opposite
side
giving
them
an
excellent
view
of
the
wharf
and
mill
as
well
as
of
the
clearing
generally
the
ground
as
has
already
been
stated
was
in
the
shape
of
a
d
the
river
bounding
the
straight
side
about
up
this
straight
side
was
the
mill
and
about
between
it
and
the
top
were
the
shrubs
behind
which
the
watchers
were
seated
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
mill
from
the
shrubs
at
the
bottom
of
the
d
pillar
the
coburns
house
stood
on
a
little
knoll
jolly
good
observation
post
this
hilliard
remarked
as
he
stretched
himself
at
ease
and
laid
his
glass
on
the
ground
beside
him
not
do
much
that
we
shall
miss
from
there
does
seem
to
be
much
to
miss
at
present
merriman
answered
looking
idly
over
the
deserted
space
about
a
quarter
to
eight
a
man
appeared
where
the
lane
from
the
road
debouched
into
the
clearing
he
walked
towards
the
shed
to
disappear
presently
behind
it
almost
immediately
blue
smoke
began
issuing
from
the
metal
chimney
in
the
shed
roof
it
was
evident
he
had
come
before
the
others
to
get
up
steam
in
about
half
an
hour
those
others
arrived
about
fifteen
men
in
all
a
lot
in
laborers
kit
they
also
vanished
behind
the
shed
but
most
of
them
reappeared
almost
immediately
laden
with
tools
and
separating
into
groups
moved
off
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
soon
work
was
in
full
swing
trees
were
being
cut
down
by
one
gang
the
branches
lopped
off
fallen
trunks
by
another
while
a
third
was
loading
up
and
running
the
stripped
stems
along
a
decauville
railway
to
the
shed
almost
incessantly
the
thin
screech
of
the
saws
rose
penetratingly
above
the
sounds
of
hacking
and
chopping
and
the
calls
of

merriman
said
when
they
had
surveyed
the
scene
for
nearly
an
hour
no
hilliard
agreed
and
there
did
seem
to
be
much
wrong
when
i
inspected
the
place
on
sunday
but
there
ca
be
anything
obviously
wrong
if
there
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
things
it
wo
be
easy
to
about

coburn
dressed
in
gray
flannel
emerged
from
his
house
and
crossed
the
grass
to
the
mill
he
remained
there
for
a
few
minutes
then
they
saw
him
walking
to
the
workers
at
the
forest
edge
he
spent
some
moments
with
each
gang
afterwards
returning
to
his
house
for
nearly
an
hour
things
went
on
as
before
and
then
coburn
reappeared
at
his
hall
door
this
time
accompanied
by
his
daughter
both
were
dressed
extraordinarily
well
for
such
a
backwater
of
civilization
he
with
a
gray
homburg
hat
and
gloves
she
as
before
in
brown
but
in
a
coat
and
skirt
and
a
smart
toque
and
motoring
veil
both
were
carrying
dust
coats
coburn
drew
the
door
to
and
they
walked
towards
the
mill
and
were
lost
to
sight
behind
it
some
minutes
passed
and
between
the
screaming
of
the
saws
the
sound
of
a
motor
engine
became
audible
after
a
further
delay
a
ford
car
came
out
from
behind
the
shed
and
moved
slowly
over
the
uneven
sward
towards
the
lane
in
the
car
were
and
miss
coburn
and
a
chauffeur
hilliard
had
been
following
every
motion
through
his
glass
and
he
now
thrust
the
instrument
into
his
companion
hand
crying
softly
look
merriman
is
that
the
lorry
driver
you
saw
merriman
focused
the
glass
on
the
chauffeur
and
recognized
him
instantly
it
was
the
same
dark
man
who
had
stared
at
him
so
resentfully
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
the
mill
some
two
months
earlier
by
jove
what
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
luck
hilliard
went
on
eagerly
all
three
of
them
that
know
you
out
of
the
way
we
can
go
down
to
the
place
now
and
ask
for
coburn
and
maybe
we
shall
have
a
chance
to
see
inside
that
shed
let
go
at
once
before
they
come
they
crawled
away
from
their
point
of
vantage
into
the
wood
and
retracing
their
steps
to
the
boat
put
it
together
and
carried
it
to
the
river
then
rowing
they
reached
the
end
of
the
wharf
where
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
came
down
into
the
stream
here
they
went
ashore
after
making
the
painter
fast
to
the
woodwork
the
front
of
the
wharf
they
had
seen
from
the
boat
was
roughly
though
strongly
made
at
the
actual
edge
there
was
a
row
of
almost
vertical
piles
pine
trees
driven
unsquared
behind
these
was
a
second
row
inclined
inwards
the
feet
of
both
rows
seemed
to
be
pretty
much
in
the
same
line
but
the
tops
of
the
raking
row
were
about
six
feet
behind
the
others
the
arrangement
seen
from
the
side
being
like
a
v
of
which
one
leg
is
vertical
these
tops
were
connected
by
beams
supporting
a
timber
floor
behind
the
raking
piles
rough
tree
stems
had
been
laid
on
the
top
of
each
other
horizontally
to
hold
back
the
earth
filled
behind
them
the
front
was
about
a
hundred
feet
long
and
was
set
some
thirty
feet
out
in
the
river
parallel
to
the
front
and
about
fifty
feet
behind
it
was
the
wall
of
the
shed
it
was
pierced
by
four
doors
all
of
which
were
closed
but
out
of
each
of
which
ran
a
line
of
narrow
gauge
railway
these
lines
were
continued
to
the
front
of
the
wharf
and
there
connected
up
by
to
a
cross
line
evidently
with
the
idea
that
a
continuous
service
of
loaded
trucks
could
be
sent
out
of
one
door
discharged
and
returned
as
empties
through
another
stacks
of
stood
ready
for
loading
between
the
lines
seems
a
sound
arrangement
hilliard
commented
as
they
made
their
inspection
quite
anything
i
noticed
before
struck
me
as
being
when
they
had
seen
all
that
the
wharf
appeared
to
offer
they
walked
round
the
end
of
the
shed
at
the
back
were
a
number
of
doors
and
through
these
also
narrow
gauge
lines
were
laid
which
connected
with
those
radiating
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
everywhere
between
the
lines
were
stacks
of
as
well
as
blocks
and
cuttings
three
or
four
of
the
doors
were
open
and
in
front
of
one
of
them
talking
to
someone
in
the
building
stood
a
man
presently
he
turned
and
saw
them
immediately
they
advanced
and
hilliard
accosted
him
we
are
looking
for
coburn
is
he
about
no
monsieur
the
man
answered
civilly
he
has
gone
into
bordeaux
he
wo
be
back
until
the
that
unfortunate
for
us
hilliard
returned
conversationally
my
friend
and
i
were
passing
up
the
river
on
our
launch
and
we
had
hoped
to
have
seen
him
however
we
shall
get
hold
of
him
later
this
is
a
fine
works
you
have
got
the
man
smiled
he
seemed
a
superior
type
to
the
others
and
was
evidently
a
foreman
not
so
bad
monsieur
we
have
four
saws
but
only
two
are
running
he
pointed
to
the
door
behind
him
as
he
spoke
and
the
two
friends
passed
in
as
if
to
have
an
idle
look
round
the
interior
was
fitted
up
like
that
of
any
other
sawmill
but
the
same
element
of
design
and
efficiency
seemed
apparent
here
as
elsewhere
the
foreman
explained
the
process
the
lopped
trunks
from
the
wood
came
in
by
one
of
two
roads
through
a
large
door
in
the
center
of
the
building
outside
each
road
was
a
saw
its
axle
running
parallel
to
the
roads
the
logs
were
caught
in
grabs
slung
on
to
the
table
of
the
saws
and
moving
automatically
all
the
time
were
cut
into
lengths
of
from
seven
to
ten
feet
the
pieces
passed
for
props
were
dumped
on
to
a
conveyor
which
ran
them
out
of
the
shed
to
be
stacked
for
seasoning
and
export
the
rejected
pieces
by
means
of
another
conveyor
moved
to
the
third
and
fourth
saws
where
they
were
cut
into
blocks
for
firewood
being
finally
delivered
into
two
large
bins
ready
for
loading
on
to
the
lorries
the
friends
exhibited
sufficient
interest
to
manage
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
over
their
survey
drawing
out
the
foreman
in
conversation
and
seeing
as
much
as
they
could
at
one
end
of
the
shed
was
the
boiler
house
and
engine
room
at
the
other
the
office
with
between
it
and
the
mill
proper
a
spacious
garage
in
which
so
they
were
told
the
six
lorries
belonging
to
the
syndicate
were
housed
three
machines
were
there
two
lying
up
empty
the
third
with
engine
running
and
loaded
with
blocks
being
ready
to
start
they
would
have
liked
to
examine
the
number
plate
but
in
the
presence
of
the
foreman
it
was
hardly
possible
finally
they
walked
across
the
clearing
to
where
felling
and
lopping
was
in
progress
and
inspected
the
operations
when
they
left
shortly
after
with
a
promise
to
return
to
meet
coburn
there
was
not
much
about
the
place
they
had
missed
that
business
is
just
as
right
as
rain
merriman
declared
when
they
were
once
more
in
the
boat
and
that
foreman
all
right
too
stake
my
life
he
was
hiding
anything
he
not
clever
enough
for
one
so
i
think
too
hilliard
admitted
and
yet
what
about
the
game
with
the
number
plates
what
the
idea
of
that
i
do
know
but
all
the
same
i
take
my
oath
there
nothing
wrong
about
the
timber
trade
it
no
go
hilliard
let
drop
chasing
wild
geese
and
get
along
with
our
i
feel
very
like
it
the
other
replied
as
he
sucked
moodily
at
his
pipe
we
watch
for
another
day
or
so
and
if
we
see
nothing
suspicious
we
can
clear
but
that
very
evening
an
incident
occurred
which
though
trifling
revived
all
their
suspicions
and
threw
them
at
once
again
into
a
sea
of
doubt
believing
that
the
coburns
would
by
that
time
have
returned
they
left
the
launch
about
five
to
call
reaching
the
edge
of
the
clearing
almost
directly
behind
the
house
they
passed
round
the
latter
and
rang
the
door
was
opened
by
miss
coburn
herself
it
happened
that
the
sun
was
shining
directly
in
her
eyes
and
she
could
not
therefore
see
her
visitors
features
you
are
the
gentlemen
who
wished
to
see
coburn
i
presume
she
said
before
merriman
could
speak
he
is
at
the
works
you
will
find
him
in
his
merriman
stepped
forward
his
cap
off
do
you
remember
me
miss
coburn
he
said
earnestly
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
in
may
when
you
were
so
kind
as
to
give
me
petrol
to
get
me
to
miss
coburn
looked
at
him
more
carefully
and
her
manner
which
had
up
to
then
been
polite
but
coolly
suddenly
changed
her
face
grew
dead
white
and
she
put
her
hand
sharply
to
her
side
as
though
to
check
the
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
for
a
moment
she
seemed
unable
to
speak
then
recovering
herself
with
a
visible
effort
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
trembled
in
spite
of
herself
mr
merriman
is
it
of
course
i
remember
wo
you
come
in
my
father
will
be
back
she
was
rapidly
regaining
and
by
the
time
merriman
had
presented
hilliard
her
manner
had
become
almost
normal
she
led
the
way
to
a
comfortably
furnished
looking
out
over
the
river
hilliard
and
i
are
on
a
motor
launch
tour
across
france
merriman
went
on
he
worked
from
england
down
the
coast
to
bordeaux
where
i
joined
him
and
we
hope
eventually
to
cross
the
country
to
the
mediterranean
and
do
the
riviera
from
the
how
perfectly
delightful
miss
coburn
replied
i
envy
yes
it
very
jolly
doing
these
rivers
and
canals
hilliard
interposed
i
have
spent
two
or
three
holidays
that
way
now
and
it
has
always
been
worth
as
they
chatted
on
in
the
pleasant
room
the
girl
seemed
completely
to
have
recovered
her
composure
and
yet
merriman
could
not
but
realize
a
constraint
in
her
manner
and
a
look
of
anxiety
in
her
clear
brown
eyes
that
something
was
disturbing
her
there
could
be
no
doubt
and
that
something
appeared
to
be
not
unconnected
with
himself
but
he
reasoned
there
was
nothing
connected
with
himself
that
could
cause
her
anxiety
unless
it
really
was
that
matter
of
the
number
plates
he
became
conscious
of
an
almost
overwhelming
desire
to
share
her
trouble
whatever
it
might
be
to
let
her
understand
that
so
far
from
willingly
causing
a
shadow
to
fall
across
her
path
there
were
few
things
he
would
not
do
to
give
her
pleasure
indeed
he
began
to
long
to
take
her
in
his
arms
to
comfort
her
presently
a
step
in
the
hall
announced
coburn
return
in
here
daddy
his
daughter
called
and
the
steps
approached
the
door
whether
by
accident
or
design
it
happened
that
miss
coburn
was
seated
directly
opposite
the
door
while
her
two
visitors
were
placed
where
they
were
screened
by
the
door
itself
from
the
view
of
anyone
entering
hilliard
his
eyes
on
the
girl
face
as
her
father
came
in
intercepted
a
glance
of
what
seemed
to
be
warning
his
gaze
swung
round
to
the
and
here
again
he
noticed
a
start
of
surprise
and
anxiety
as
coburn
recognized
his
visitor
but
in
this
case
it
was
so
quickly
over
that
had
he
not
been
watching
intently
he
would
have
missed
it
however
slight
though
it
was
it
undoubtedly
seemed
to
confirm
the
other
indications
which
pointed
to
the
existence
of
some
secret
in
the
life
of
these
two
a
secret
shared
apparently
by
the
driver
and
connected
in
some
way
with
the
lorry
number
plates
coburn
was
very
polite
suave
and
polished
as
an
accomplished
man
of
the
world
but
his
manner
was
not
really
friendly
in
fact
hilliard
seemed
to
sense
a
veiled
hostility
a
few
deft
questions
put
him
in
possession
of
the
travelers
ostensible
plans
which
he
discussed
with
some
interest
but
he
said
to
hilliard
i
am
afraid
you
are
in
error
in
coming
up
this
river
lesque
the
canal
you
want
to
get
from
here
is
the
midi
it
enters
the
mediterranean
not
far
from
narbonne
but
the
connection
from
this
side
is
from
the
garonne
you
should
have
gone
to
langon
nearly
forty
miles
above
we
had
hoped
to
go
from
still
farther
south
hilliard
answered
we
have
penetrated
a
good
many
of
the
rivers
or
rather
i
have
and
we
came
up
here
to
see
the
and
forests
of
the
landes
which
are
new
to
me
a
very
desolate
country
is
it
not
coburn
agreed
continuing
courteously
i
am
glad
at
all
events
that
your
researches
have
brought
you
into
our
neighborhood
we
do
not
come
across
many
visitors
here
and
it
is
pleasant
occasionally
to
speak
one
own
language
to
someone
outside
one
household
if
you
will
put
up
with
i
am
sure
we
should
both
be
glad
he
looked
at
his
daughter
if
you
would
wait
and
take
some
dinner
with
us
now
tomorrow
you
could
explore
the
woods
which
are
really
worth
seeing
though
monotonous
and
if
you
are
at
all
interested
i
should
like
to
show
you
our
little
works
but
i
warn
you
the
affair
is
my
hobby
as
well
as
my
business
for
the
time
being
and
i
am
apt
to
assume
others
have
as
great
an
interest
in
it
as
myself
you
must
not
let
me
bore
hilliard
suspicious
and
critically
observant
wondered
if
he
had
not
interrupted
a
second
rapid
look
between
father
and
daughter
he
could
not
be
sure
but
at
all
events
the
girl
hastened
to
second
her
invitation
i
hope
you
will
wait
for
dinner
she
said
as
he
says
we
see
so
few
people
and
particularly
so
few
english
that
it
would
be
doing
us
a
kindness
i
afraid
that
not
very
complimentary
she
laughed
brightly
but
it
at
least
they
stayed
and
enjoyed
themselves
coburn
proved
himself
an
entertaining
host
and
his
conversation
though
satirical
was
worth
listening
to
he
and
hilliard
talked
while
merriman
who
was
something
of
a
musician
tried
over
songs
with
miss
coburn
had
it
not
been
for
an
uneasy
feeling
that
they
were
to
some
extent
playing
the
part
of
spies
the
evening
would
have
been
a
delight
to
the
visitors
before
they
left
for
the
launch
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
stay
over
the
following
day
lunch
with
the
coburns
and
go
for
a
tramp
through
the
forest
in
the
afternoon
they
took
their
leave
with
cordial
expressions
of
good
will
i
say
merriman
hilliard
said
eagerly
as
they
strolled
back
through
the
wood
did
you
notice
how
your
sudden
appearance
upset
them
both
there
can
be
no
further
doubt
about
it
there
something
what
it
may
be
i
do
know
but
there
is
there
nothing
wrong
at
all
events
merriman
asserted
doggedly
not
wrong
in
the
sense
you
mean
no
hilliard
agreed
quickly
but
wrong
for
all
that
now
that
i
have
met
miss
coburn
i
can
see
that
your
estimate
of
her
was
correct
but
anyone
with
half
an
eye
could
see
also
that
she
is
frightened
and
upset
about
something
there
something
wrong
and
she
wants
a
helping
damn
you
hilliard
how
you
talk
merriman
growled
with
a
sudden
wave
of
unreasoning
rage
there
nothing
wrong
and
no
need
for
our
meddling
let
us
clear
out
and
go
on
with
our
hilliard
smiled
under
cover
of
darkness
and
miss
our
lunch
and
excursion
with
the
coburns
he
asked
maliciously
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
merriman
answered
irritably
drop
this
childish
tomfoolery
about
plots
and
mysteries
and
try
to
get
reasonably
sane
again
here
he
went
on
fiercely
as
the
other
demurred
i
tell
you
what
i
do
if
you
like
i
have
no
more
suspicions
or
spying
but
i
ask
her
if
there
is
anything
wrong
say
i
thought
there
was
from
her
manner
and
ask
her
the
direct
question
will
that
please
you
and
get
well
snubbed
for
your
pains
hilliard
returned
you
tried
that
once
already
why
did
you
not
persist
in
your
inquiries
about
the
number
plate
when
she
told
you
about
the
driver
merriman
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
burst
out
well
hang
it
all
man
what
do
you
suggest
during
the
evening
an
idea
had
occurred
to
hilliard
and
he
returned
to
it
now
i
tell
you
he
answered
slowly
and
instinctively
he
lowered
his
voice
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
we
must
see
their
steamer
loaded
i
been
thinking
it
over
we
must
see
what
if
anything
goes
on
board
that
boat
beside
merriman
only
grunted
in
reply
but
hilliard
realizing
his
condition
was
satisfied
and
merriman
lying
awake
that
night
on
the
port
locker
of
the
swallow
began
himself
to
realize
his
condition
and
to
understand
that
his
whole
future
life
and
happiness
lay
between
the
dainty
hands
of
madeleine
coburn
chapter
the
visit
of
the
girondin
next
morning
found
both
the
friends
moody
and
engrossed
with
their
own
thoughts
merriman
was
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
new
factor
which
had
come
into
his
life
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
fancied
himself
in
love
like
most
men
of
his
age
he
had
had
affairs
of
varying
seriousness
which
in
due
time
had
run
their
course
and
died
a
natural
death
but
this
he
felt
was
different
at
last
he
believed
he
had
met
the
one
woman
and
the
idea
thrilled
him
with
awe
and
exultation
and
filled
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
hilliard
preoccupation
was
different
he
was
considering
in
detail
his
idea
that
if
a
close
enough
watch
could
be
kept
on
the
loading
of
the
syndicate
ship
it
would
at
least
settle
the
smuggling
question
he
did
not
think
that
any
article
could
be
shipped
in
sufficient
bulk
to
make
the
trade
pay
unnoticed
by
a
skilfully
concealed
observer
even
if
the
commodity
were
a
liquid
brandy
for
example
sent
aboard
through
a
flexible
pipe
the
thing
would
be
seen
but
two
unexpected
difficulties
had
arisen
since
last
night
firstly
they
had
made
friends
with
the
coburns
excursions
with
them
were
in
contemplation
and
one
had
actually
been
arranged
for
that
very
day
while
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
been
asked
virtually
to
make
the
manager
house
their
headquarters
and
it
was
evidently
expected
that
the
two
parties
should
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
under
these
circumstances
how
were
the
friends
to
get
away
to
watch
the
loading
of
the
boat
and
then
it
occurred
to
hilliard
that
here
perhaps
was
evidence
of
design
that
this
very
difficulty
had
been
deliberately
caused
by
coburn
with
the
object
of
keeping
himself
and
merriman
under
observation
and
rendering
them
harmless
this
he
recognized
was
guesswork
but
still
it
might
be
the
truth
he
racked
his
brains
to
find
some
way
of
meeting
the
difficulty
and
at
last
after
considering
many
plans
he
thought
he
saw
his
way
they
would
as
soon
as
possible
take
leave
of
their
hosts
and
return
to
bordeaux
ostensibly
to
resume
their
trip
east
from
there
they
would
come
out
to
the
clearing
by
road
and
from
the
observation
post
they
had
already
used
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
arrival
of
the
ship
and
subsequent
developments
at
night
they
might
be
even
able
to
hide
on
the
wharf
itself
in
any
case
they
could
hardly
fail
to
see
if
anything
other
than
was
loaded
so
far
so
good
but
there
was
a
second
and
more
formidable
difficulty
would
merriman
consent
to
this
plan
and
agree
to
help
hilliard
was
doubtful
that
his
friend
had
so
obviously
fallen
in
love
with
this
madeleine
coburn
was
an
unexpected
and
unfortunate
complication
he
could
of
course
play
on
the
string
that
the
girl
was
in
danger
and
wanted
help
but
he
had
already
used
that
with
disappointing
results
however
he
could
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
his
best
to
talk
merriman
round
accordingly
when
they
were
smoking
their
pipes
he
broached
the
subject
but
as
he
had
feared
his
friend
would
have
none
of
it
i
tell
you
i
wo
do
anything
of
the
kind
he
said
angrily
here
we
come
two
strangers
poking
our
noses
into
what
does
not
concern
us
and
we
are
met
with
kindness
and
hospitality
and
invited
to
join
a
family
party
good
lord
hilliard
i
ca
believe
that
it
is
really
you
that
suggests
it
you
surely
do
mean
that
you
believe
that
the
coburns
are
smuggling
brandy
of
course
not
you
old
hilliard
answered
but
i
do
believe
and
so
must
you
that
there
is
something
queer
going
on
we
want
to
be
sure
there
is
nothing
sinister
behind
it
surely
old
man
you
will
help
me
in
that
if
i
thought
there
was
anything
wrong
you
know
i
help
you
merriman
returned
somewhat
mollified
by
the
other
attitude
but
i
do
it
is
quite
absurd
to
suggest
the
coburns
are
engaged
in
anything
illegal
and
if
you
grant
that
your
whole
case
falls
to
the
hilliard
saw
that
for
the
moment
at
all
events
he
could
get
no
more
he
therefore
dropped
the
subject
and
they
conversed
on
other
topics
until
it
was
time
to
go
ashore
lunch
with
their
new
acquaintances
passed
pleasantly
and
after
it
the
two
friends
went
with
coburn
to
see
over
the
works
hilliard
thought
it
better
to
explain
that
they
had
seen
something
of
them
on
the
previous
day
but
notwithstanding
this
assurance
coburn
insisted
on
their
going
over
the
whole
place
again
he
showed
them
everything
in
detail
and
when
the
inspection
was
complete
both
men
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
business
was
genuine
and
that
nothing
was
being
carried
on
other
than
the
ostensible
trade
coburn
also
gave
them
his
views
on
the
enterprise
and
these
seemed
so
eminently
reasonable
and
natural
that
hilliard
suspicions
once
more
became
dulled
and
he
began
to
wonder
if
their
host
peculiar
manner
could
not
have
been
due
to
some
cause
other
than
that
he
had
imagined
there
is
not
so
much
money
in
the
as
i
had
hoped
coburn
explained
when
we
started
here
the
baltic
trade
which
was
of
course
the
big
trade
before
the
war
had
not
revived
now
we
find
the
baltic
competition
growing
keener
and
our
margin
of
profit
is
dwindling
we
are
handicapped
also
by
having
only
a
traffic
most
of
the
baltic
firms
exporting
have
an
import
trade
in
coal
as
well
this
gives
them
double
freights
and
pulls
down
their
overhead
costs
but
it
would
pay
us
to
follow
their
example
if
we
ran
coal
it
could
only
be
to
bordeaux
and
that
would
take
up
more
of
our
boat
time
than
it
would
be
hilliard
nodded
and
coburn
went
on
on
the
other
hand
we
are
doing
better
in
what
i
may
call
we
getting
quite
a
good
price
for
our
and
selling
more
and
more
of
it
three
large
firms
in
bordeaux
have
put
in
fireboxes
and
nothing
else
and
two
others
are
thinking
of
following
suit
then
i
am
considering
two
developments
in
fact
i
have
decided
on
the
first
we
are
going
to
put
in
an
air
compressor
in
our
and
use
pneumatic
tools
in
the
forest
for
felling
and
lopping
i
estimate
that
will
save
us
six
men
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
market
for
pine
paving
blocks
for
streets
i
have
gone
into
this
yet
but
i
doing
that
sounds
very
promising
hilliard
answered
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
i
believe
soft
wood
blocks
are
considered
better
than
they
wear
more
evenly
i
understand
i
trying
to
persuade
the
paris
authorities
to
try
a
piece
of
it
and
if
that
does
well
it
might
develop
into
a
big
thing
indeed
i
can
imagine
our
giving
up
the
altogether
in
the
after
a
time
miss
coburn
joined
them
and
the
ford
car
being
brought
out
the
party
set
off
on
their
excursion
they
visited
a
part
of
the
wood
where
the
trees
were
larger
than
near
the
sawmill
and
had
a
pleasant
though
uneventful
afternoon
the
evening
they
spent
as
before
at
the
coburns
house
next
day
the
friends
invited
their
hosts
to
join
them
in
a
trip
up
the
river
hilliard
tactfully
interested
the
manager
in
the
various
gadgets
he
had
fitted
up
in
the
launch
and
merriman
dream
of
making
tea
with
miss
coburn
materialized
the
more
he
saw
of
the
gentle
girl
the
more
he
found
his
heart
going
out
to
her
and
the
more
it
was
borne
in
on
him
that
life
without
her
was
becoming
a
prospect
more
terrible
than
he
could
bring
himself
to
contemplate
they
went
on
the
flood
tide
for
some
twenty
miles
until
the
forest
thinned
away
and
they
came
on
vineyards
there
they
went
ashore
and
it
was
not
until
the
shades
of
evening
were
beginning
to
fall
that
they
arrived
back
at
the
clearing
as
they
swung
round
the
bend
in
sight
of
the
wharf
coburn
made
an
exclamation
hallo
he
cried
there
the
girondin
she
has
made
a
good
run
we
were
expecting
her
for
another
three
or
four
at
the
wharf
lay
a
vessel
of
about
tons
burden
with
bluff
rounded
bows
sitting
high
up
out
of
the
water
a
long
straight
waist
and
a
bridge
and
cluster
of
deckhouses
at
the
stern
our
motor
ship
coburn
explained
with
evident
pride
we
had
her
specially
designed
for
carrying
the
and
also
for
this
river
she
only
draws
eight
feet
you
must
come
on
board
and
have
a
look
over
this
was
of
all
things
what
hilliard
most
desired
he
recognized
that
if
he
was
allowed
to
inspect
her
really
thoroughly
it
would
finally
dispel
any
lingering
suspicion
he
might
still
harbor
that
the
syndicate
was
engaged
in
smuggling
operations
the
two
points
on
which
that
suspicion
had
been
founded
the
absence
of
return
cargoes
and
the
locality
of
the
french
end
of
the
enterprise
were
not
he
now
saw
really
suspicious
at
all
coburn
remark
met
the
first
of
these
points
and
showed
that
he
was
perfectly
alive
to
the
handicap
of
a
oneway
traffic
the
matter
had
not
been
material
when
the
industry
was
started
but
now
owing
to
the
recovery
of
the
baltic
trade
after
the
war
it
was
becoming
important
and
the
manager
evidently
realized
that
it
might
easily
grow
sufficiently
to
kill
the
trade
altogether
and
the
locality
question
was
even
simpler
the
syndicate
had
chosen
the
pine
forests
of
the
landes
for
their
operations
because
they
wanted
timber
close
to
the
sea
on
the
top
of
these
considerations
came
the
lack
of
secrecy
about
the
ship
it
could
only
mean
that
there
really
was
nothing
aboard
to
conceal
on
reaching
the
wharf
all
four
crossed
the
gangway
to
the
deck
of
the
girondin
at
close
quarters
she
seemed
quite
a
big
boat
in
the
bows
was
a
small
forecastle
containing
quarters
for
the
crew
of
five
men
as
well
as
the
oil
tanks
and
certain
stores
then
amidships
was
a
long
expanse
of
holds
while
aft
were
the
officers
cabins
and
tiny
galley
navigating
bridge
and
last
but
not
least
the
with
its
set
of
diesel
engines
she
seemed
throughout
a
boat
no
money
having
apparently
been
spared
to
make
her
efficient
and
comfortable
she
carries
between
six
and
seven
thousand
props
every
trip
coburn
told
them
that
is
without
any
deck
cargo
i
dare
say
in
summer
we
could
put
ten
thousand
on
her
if
we
tried
but
she
is
rather
shallow
in
the
draught
for
it
and
we
do
care
to
run
any
risks
hallo
captain
back
again
he
broke
off
as
a
man
in
a
blue
pilot
cloth
coat
and
a
peaked
cap
emerged
from
below
the
newcomer
was
powerfully
built
and
would
have
been
tall
but
for
rather
rounded
shoulders
and
a
stoop
he
was
clean
shaven
with
a
heavy
jaw
and
thin
lips
which
were
compressed
into
a
narrow
line
his
expression
was
vindictive
as
well
as
somewhat
crafty
and
he
looked
a
man
who
would
not
be
turned
from
his
purpose
by
nice
points
of
morality
or
conscience
though
hilliard
instinctively
noted
these
details
they
did
not
particularly
excite
his
interest
but
his
interest
was
nevertheless
keenly
aroused
for
he
saw
the
man
as
his
gaze
fell
on
himself
and
merriman
give
a
sudden
start
and
then
flash
a
quick
questioning
glance
at
coburn
the
action
was
momentary
but
it
was
enough
to
bring
back
with
a
rush
all
hilliard
suspicions
surely
he
thought
there
must
be
something
if
the
sight
of
a
stranger
upsets
all
these
people
in
this
way
but
he
had
not
time
to
ponder
the
problem
the
captain
instantly
recovered
himself
pulled
off
his
cap
to
miss
coburn
and
shook
hands
all
round
coburn
introducing
the
visitors
good
trip
captain
the
manager
went
on
you
ahead
of
not
so
bad
the
newcomer
admitted
in
a
voice
and
manner
singularly
cultivated
for
a
man
in
his
position
we
had
a
good
wind
behind
us
most
of
the
they
chatted
for
a
few
moments
then
started
on
their
tour
of
inspection
though
hilliard
was
once
again
keenly
on
the
alert
the
examination
so
far
as
he
could
see
left
nothing
to
be
desired
they
visited
every
part
of
the
vessel
from
the
forecastle
storerooms
to
the
tunnel
of
the
screw
shaft
and
from
the
to
the
bottom
of
the
hold
and
every
question
either
of
the
friends
asked
was
replied
to
fully
and
without
hesitation
that
evening
like
the
preceding
they
passed
with
the
coburns
the
captain
and
the
engineer
a
short
man
named
bulla
strolled
up
with
them
and
remained
for
dinner
but
left
shortly
afterwards
on
the
plea
of
matters
to
attend
to
on
board
the
friends
stayed
on
playing
bridge
and
it
was
late
when
they
said
and
set
out
to
walk
back
to
the
launch
during
the
intervals
of
play
hilliard
mind
had
been
busy
with
the
mystery
which
he
believed
existed
in
connection
with
the
syndicate
and
he
had
decided
that
to
try
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
would
go
down
to
the
wharf
that
night
and
see
if
any
interesting
operations
went
on
under
cover
of
darkness
the
idea
of
a
midnight
loading
of
contraband
no
longer
appealed
to
his
imagination
but
vaguely
he
wished
to
make
sure
that
no
secret
activities
were
in
progress
he
was
at
least
certain
that
none
had
taken
place
up
to
the
present
that
coburn
was
personally
concerned
in
at
all
events
from
the
moment
they
had
first
sighted
the
ship
until
they
had
left
the
manager
house
at
the
conclusion
of
the
game
of
bridge
not
five
minutes
ago
he
had
been
in
coburn
company
next
day
it
was
understood
they
were
to
meet
again
so
that
if
the
manager
wished
to
carry
out
any
secret
operations
they
could
only
be
done
during
the
night
accordingly
when
they
reached
the
launch
he
turned
to
merriman
you
go
ahead
old
man
i
going
to
have
a
look
round
before
turning
in
do
wait
up
for
me
put
out
the
light
when
you
done
with
it
and
leave
the
companion
unlatched
so
that
i
can
follow
you
merriman
grunted
disapprovingly
but
offered
no
further
objection
he
clambered
on
board
the
launch
and
disappeared
below
while
hilliard
remaining
in
the
collapsible
boat
began
to
row
silently
towards
the
wharf
the
night
was
dark
and
still
but
warm
the
moon
had
not
risen
and
the
sky
was
overcast
blotting
out
even
the
small
light
of
the
stars
there
was
a
faint
whisper
of
air
currents
among
the
trees
and
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
moving
mass
of
water
was
punctuated
by
tiny
splashes
and
gurgles
as
little
eddies
formed
round
the
stem
of
the
boat
or
wavelets
broke
against
the
banks
hilliard
eyes
had
by
this
time
become
accustomed
to
the
gloom
and
he
could
dimly
distinguish
the
serrated
line
of
the
trees
against
the
sky
on
either
side
of
him
and
later
the
banks
of
the
clearing
with
the
faint
ghostly
radiance
from
the
surface
of
the
water
he
pulled
on
with
swift
silent
strokes
and
presently
the
dark
mass
of
the
girondin
loomed
in
sight
the
ship
longer
than
the
wharf
projected
for
several
feet
above
and
below
it
hilliard
turned
his
boat
inshore
with
the
object
of
passing
between
the
hull
and
the
bank
and
so
reaching
the
landing
steps
but
as
he
rounded
the
vessel
stern
he
saw
that
her
starboard
side
was
lighted
up
and
he
ceased
rowing
sitting
motionless
and
silently
holding
water
till
the
boat
began
to
drift
back
into
the
obscurity
the
wharf
was
above
the
level
of
his
head
and
he
could
only
see
appearing
over
its
edge
the
tops
of
the
piles
of
these
as
well
as
the
end
of
the
ship
navigating
bridge
and
the
gangway
were
illuminated
by
he
imagined
a
lamp
on
the
side
of
one
of
the
deckhouses
but
everything
was
very
still
and
the
place
seemed
deserted
hilliard
intention
had
been
to
land
on
the
wharf
and
crouching
behind
the
props
await
events
but
now
he
doubted
if
he
could
reach
his
hiding
place
without
coming
within
the
radius
of
the
lamp
and
so
exposing
himself
to
the
view
of
anyone
who
might
be
on
the
watch
on
board
he
recollected
that
the
port
or
river
side
of
the
ship
was
in
darkness
and
he
thought
it
might
therefore
be
better
if
he
could
get
directly
aboard
there
from
the
boat
having
removed
his
shoes
he
rowed
gently
round
the
stern
and
examined
the
side
for
a
possible
way
up
the
ship
being
light
forward
was
heavily
down
in
the
stern
and
he
found
the
lower
deck
was
not
more
than
six
or
seven
feet
above
water
level
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
could
get
hold
of
the
mooring
rope
pawls
he
might
be
able
to
climb
aboard
but
this
after
a
number
of
trials
he
found
impossible
as
in
the
absence
of
someone
at
the
oars
to
steady
the
boat
the
latter
always
drifted
away
from
the
hull
before
he
could
grasp
what
he
wanted
he
decided
he
must
risk
passing
through
the
lighted
area
and
having
for
the
third
time
rowed
round
the
stern
he
brought
the
boat
up
as
close
to
the
hull
as
possible
until
he
reached
the
wharf
then
passing
in
between
the
two
rows
of
piles
and
feeling
his
way
in
the
dark
he
made
the
painter
fast
to
a
diagonal
so
that
the
boat
would
lie
hidden
should
anyone
examine
the
steps
with
a
light
the
hull
lay
touching
the
vertical
piles
and
hilliard
edging
along
a
waling
to
the
front
of
the
wharf
felt
with
his
foot
through
the
darkness
for
the
stern
belting
the
tide
was
low
and
he
found
this
was
not
more
than
a
foot
above
the
timber
on
which
he
stood
he
could
now
see
the
deck
light
an
electric
bulb
on
the
side
of
the
captain
cabin
and
it
showed
him
the
top
of
the
taffrail
some
little
distance
above
the
level
of
his
eyes
taking
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
stepping
upon
the
belting
he
succeeded
in
grasping
the
taffrail
in
a
moment
he
was
over
it
and
on
deck
and
in
another
moment
he
had
slipped
round
the
deckhouse
and
out
of
the
light
of
the
lamp
there
he
stopped
listening
for
an
alarm
but
the
silence
remained
unbroken
and
he
believed
he
had
been
unobserved
he
recalled
the
construction
of
the
ship
the
lower
deck
on
which
he
was
standing
ran
across
the
stern
and
formed
a
narrow
passage
some
forty
feet
long
at
each
side
of
the
central
cabin
this
cabin
contained
the
galley
and
mess
room
as
well
as
the
first
officer
quarters
bulla
stateroom
hilliard
remembered
was
down
below
beside
the
from
the
lower
deck
two
ladders
led
to
the
bridge
deck
at
the
forward
end
of
which
was
situated
the
captain
stateroom
aft
of
this
building
most
of
the
remaining
bridge
deck
was
taken
up
by
two
lifeboats
and
housed
in
chocks
on
the
top
of
the
captain
cabin
was
the
bridge
and
reached
by
two
ladders
which
passed
up
at
either
side
of
the
cabin
hilliard
reconnoitering
crept
round
to
the
port
side
of
the
ship
the
lower
deck
was
in
complete
darkness
and
he
passed
the
range
of
cabins
and
silently
ascended
the
steps
to
the
deck
above
here
also
it
was
dark
but
a
faint
light
shone
from
the
window
of
the
captain
cabin
stealthily
hilliard
tiptoed
to
the
porthole
the
glass
was
hooked
back
but
a
curtain
hung
across
the
opening
fortunately
it
was
not
drawn
quite
tight
to
one
side
and
he
found
that
by
leaning
up
against
the
bridge
ladder
he
could
see
into
the
interior
a
glance
showed
him
that
the
room
was
empty
as
he
paused
irresolutely
wondering
what
he
should
do
next
he
heard
a
door
open
there
was
a
step
on
the
deck
below
and
the
door
slammed
sharply
someone
was
coming
to
the
ladder
at
the
top
of
which
he
stood
like
a
shadow
hilliard
slipped
aft
and
as
he
heard
the
unknown
ascending
the
steps
he
looked
round
for
cover
the
starboard
boat
and
a
narrow
strip
of
deck
were
lighted
up
but
the
port
boat
was
in
shadow
he
could
distinguish
it
merely
as
a
dark
blot
on
the
sky
recognizing
that
he
must
be
hidden
should
the
port
deck
light
be
turned
on
he
reached
the
boat
felt
his
way
round
the
stern
and
crouching
down
crept
as
far
underneath
it
as
he
could
there
he
remained
motionless
the
newcomer
began
slowly
to
pace
the
deck
and
the
aroma
of
a
good
cigar
floated
in
the
still
air
up
and
down
he
walked
with
leisurely
unhurried
footsteps
he
kept
to
the
dark
side
of
the
ship
and
hilliard
though
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
red
point
of
the
cigar
each
time
the
other
reached
the
stern
could
not
tell
who
he
was
presently
other
footsteps
announced
the
approach
of
a
second
individual
and
in
a
moment
hilliard
heard
the
captain
voice
where
are
you
bulla
here
came
in
the
engineer
voice
from
the
the
captain
approached
and
the
two
men
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
talking
in
low
tones
hilliard
could
catch
the
words
when
the
speakers
were
near
the
stern
but
lost
them
when
they
went
forward
to
the
break
of
the
poop
confound
that
man
coburn
he
heard
captain
beamish
mutter
what
on
earth
is
keeping
him
all
this
time
the
young
visitors
doubtless
rumbled
bulla
with
a
fat
chuckle
our
friends
of
the
yes
confound
them
too
growled
beamish
who
seemed
to
be
in
an
unenviable
frame
of
mind
damned
nuisance
their
coming
round
i
should
like
to
know
what
they
are
nothing
particular
i
should
fancy
probably
out
doing
some
kind
of
a
they
passed
round
the
deckhouse
and
hilliard
could
not
hear
the
reply
when
they
returned
captain
beamish
was
speaking
thinks
it
would
about
double
our
profits
hilliard
heard
him
say
he
suggests
a
second
depot
on
the
other
side
say
at
swansea
that
would
look
all
right
on
account
of
the
south
wales
but
we
getting
all
we
can
out
of
the
old
hooker
as
it
is
bulla
objected
i
do
see
how
she
could
do
another
archer
suggests
a
second
the
engineer
paused
then
went
on
but
that
no
new
suggestion
that
was
proposed
before
ever
the
thing
was
i
know
but
the
circumstances
have
changed
now
we
should
again
they
passed
out
of
earshot
and
hilliard
took
the
opportunity
to
stretch
his
somewhat
cramped
limbs
he
was
considerably
interested
by
what
he
had
heard
the
phrase
captain
beamish
had
used
in
reference
to
the
proposed
depot
at
swansea
it
would
look
all
right
on
account
of
the
coalfields
was
suggestive
surely
that
was
meaningless
unless
there
was
some
secret
activity
unless
the
trade
was
only
a
blind
to
cover
some
more
lucrative
and
probably
more
sinister
undertaking
at
first
sight
it
seemed
so
but
he
had
not
time
to
think
it
out
then
the
men
were
returning
bulla
was
speaking
this
time
and
hilliard
soon
found
he
was
telling
a
somewhat
improper
story
as
the
two
men
disappeared
round
the
deckhouse
he
heard
their
hoarse
laughter
ring
out
then
the
captain
cried
that
you
coburn
the
murmur
of
voices
grew
louder
and
more
confused
and
immediately
sank
a
door
opened
then
closed
and
once
more
silence
reigned
to
hilliard
it
seemed
that
here
was
a
chance
which
he
must
not
miss
coming
out
from
his
hiding
place
he
crept
stealthily
along
the
deck
in
the
hope
that
he
might
find
out
where
the
men
had
gone
and
learn
something
from
their
conversation
the
captain
cabin
was
the
probable
meeting
place
and
hilliard
slipped
silently
back
to
the
window
through
which
he
had
glanced
before
as
he
approached
he
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
and
he
cautiously
leaned
back
against
the
bridge
ladder
and
peeped
in
round
the
partly
open
curtain
three
of
the
four
seats
the
room
contained
were
now
occupied
the
captain
engineer
and
coburn
sat
round
the
central
table
which
bore
a
bottle
of
whisky
a
soda
siphon
and
glasses
as
well
as
a
box
of
cigars
the
men
seemed
preoccupied
and
a
little
anxious
the
captain
was
speaking
and
have
you
found
out
anything
about
them
he
asked
coburn
only
what
i
have
been
able
to
pick
up
from
their
own
conversation
the
manager
answered
i
wrote
morton
asking
him
to
make
inquiries
about
them
but
of
course
there
has
been
time
yet
for
a
reply
from
their
own
showing
one
of
them
is
seymour
merriman
junior
partner
of
edwards
merriman
gracechurch
street
wine
merchants
that
the
dark
one
the
one
who
was
here
before
the
other
is
a
man
called
hilliard
he
is
a
clever
fellow
and
holds
a
good
position
in
the
customs
department
he
has
had
this
launch
for
some
years
and
apparently
has
done
the
same
kind
of
trip
through
the
continental
rivers
on
previous
holidays
but
i
could
not
find
out
whether
merriman
had
ever
accompanied
him
but
you
do
think
they
smell
a
rat
i
do
think
so
he
said
slowly
but
i
not
at
all
sure
merriman
we
believe
noticed
the
number
plate
that
day
i
told
you
you
remember
henri
is
sure
that
he
did
and
madeleine
thinks
so
too
it
just
a
little
queer
his
coming
back
but
i
swear
they
seen
nothing
suspicious
this
you
ca
yourself
account
for
his
coming
back
again
coburn
hesitated
not
with
any
certainty
he
said
at
last
then
with
a
grimace
he
continued
but
i
a
little
afraid
that
it
perhaps
bulla
the
engineer
made
a
sudden
gesture
i
thought
so
he
exclaimed
even
in
the
little
i
saw
of
them
this
evening
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
wind
i
guess
that
accounts
for
the
whole
thing
what
do
you
say
skipper
the
big
man
nodded
i
should
think
so
he
admitted
with
a
look
of
relief
i
think
it
a
mare
nest
coburn
i
do
believe
we
need
i
not
so
sure
coburn
answered
slowly
i
do
think
we
need
worry
about
merriman
but
i
hanged
if
i
know
what
to
think
about
hilliard
he
pretty
observant
and
there
not
much
about
this
place
that
he
has
seen
at
one
time
or
all
the
better
for
us
is
it
bulla
queried
so
far
as
it
goes
yes
the
manager
agreed
and
i
stuffed
him
with
yarns
about
costs
and
about
giving
up
the
props
and
going
in
for
paving
blocks
and
so
on
which
i
think
he
swallowed
but
why
should
he
want
to
know
what
we
are
doing
what
possible
interest
can
the
place
have
for
him
unless
he
suspects
they
have
done
anything
suspicious
themselves
not
that
i
have
never
caught
them
trying
to
pump
any
of
the
men
captain
beamish
moved
impatiently
i
do
think
we
need
worry
he
repeated
with
a
trace
of
aggression
in
his
manner
let
get
on
to
business
have
you
heard
from
archer
coburn
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
while
hilliard
instinctively
bent
forward
believing
he
was
at
last
about
to
learn
something
which
would
throw
a
light
on
these
mysterious
happenings
but
alas
for
him
just
as
the
manager
began
to
speak
he
heard
steps
on
the
gangway
which
passed
on
board
and
a
man
began
to
climb
the
starboard
ladder
to
the
upper
deck
hilliard
first
thought
was
to
return
to
his
hiding
place
under
the
boat
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
so
far
away
from
the
center
of
interest
and
before
he
had
consciously
thought
out
the
situation
he
found
himself
creeping
silently
up
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
there
he
believed
he
would
be
safe
from
observation
while
remaining
within
earshot
of
the
cabin
and
if
anyone
followed
him
up
the
ladder
he
could
creep
round
on
the
roof
of
the
cabin
to
the
back
of
the
out
of
sight
the
newcomer
tapped
at
the
captain
door
and
after
a
shout
of
come
in
opened
it
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
coburn
voice
said
we
were
just
talking
of
you
henri
the
skipper
wants
to
know
and
the
door
closed
hilliard
was
not
long
in
slipping
back
to
his
former
position
at
the
porthole
by
jove
bulla
was
saying
and
to
think
that
two
years
ago
i
was
working
a
little
coaster
at
twenty
quid
a
month
and
you
coburn
two
years
ago
you
were
much
better
fixed
if
as
well
eh
coburn
ignored
the
question
it
good
but
it
not
good
enough
he
declared
this
thing
run
for
ever
if
we
go
on
too
long
somebody
will
tumble
to
it
what
we
want
is
to
try
to
get
our
piles
made
and
close
it
down
before
anything
happens
we
ought
to
have
that
other
ship
running
we
could
double
our
income
with
another
ship
and
another
depot
and
swansea
seems
to
me
the
bulla
and
i
were
just
talking
of
that
before
you
came
aboard
the
captain
answered
you
know
we
have
considered
that
again
and
again
and
we
have
always
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
are
pushing
the
thing
strongly
our
organization
has
improved
since
then
we
can
do
more
now
with
less
risk
it
ought
to
be
reconsidered
will
you
go
into
the
thing
skipper
certainly
i
bring
it
before
our
next
meeting
but
i
wo
promise
to
vote
for
it
in
our
business
it
not
difficult
to
kill
the
goose
the
talk
drifted
to
other
matters
while
hilliard
thrilled
to
the
marrow
remained
crouching
motionless
beneath
the
porthole
concentrating
all
his
attention
on
the
conversation
in
the
hope
of
catching
some
word
or
phrase
which
might
throw
further
light
on
the
mysterious
enterprise
under
discussion
while
the
affair
itself
was
being
spoken
of
he
had
almost
ceased
to
be
aware
of
his
surroundings
so
eagerly
had
he
listened
to
what
was
being
said
but
now
that
the
talk
had
turned
to
more
ordinary
subjects
he
began
more
or
less
subconsciously
to
take
stock
of
his
own
position
he
realized
in
the
first
place
that
he
was
in
very
real
danger
a
quick
movement
either
of
the
men
in
the
cabin
or
of
some
member
of
the
crew
might
lead
to
his
discovery
and
he
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
might
pay
the
forfeit
for
his
curiosity
with
his
life
he
could
imagine
the
manner
in
which
the
accident
would
be
staged
doubtless
his
body
showing
all
the
appearance
of
death
from
drowning
would
be
found
in
the
river
with
alongside
it
the
upturned
boat
as
evidence
of
the
cause
of
the
disaster
and
if
he
should
die
his
secret
would
die
with
him
should
he
not
then
be
content
with
what
he
had
learned
and
clear
out
while
he
could
so
as
to
ensure
his
knowledge
being
preserved
he
felt
that
he
ought
and
yet
the
desire
to
remain
in
the
hope
of
doing
still
better
was
overpowering
but
as
he
hesitated
the
power
of
choice
was
taken
away
the
men
in
the
cabin
were
making
a
move
coburn
finished
his
whisky
and
he
and
henri
rose
to
their
feet
well
the
former
said
there
one
we
must
be
the
others
stood
up
also
and
at
the
same
moment
hilliard
crept
once
more
up
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
and
crouched
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
hardly
was
he
there
when
the
men
came
out
of
the
cabin
to
the
deck
beneath
the
bridge
then
with
a
brief
exchange
of
coburn
and
the
lorry
driver
passed
down
the
ladder
crossed
the
gangway
and
disappeared
behind
a
stack
of
on
the
wharf
bulla
with
a
grunted
descended
the
port
steps
and
hilliard
heard
the
door
leading
below
open
and
shut
the
starboard
deck
lamp
snapped
off
and
finally
the
captain
door
shut
and
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
some
fifteen
minutes
later
the
faint
light
from
the
porthole
vanished
and
all
was
dark
and
silent
but
for
more
than
an
hour
hilliard
remained
crouching
motionless
on
the
bridge
fearing
lest
some
sound
that
he
might
make
in
his
descent
should
betray
him
if
the
captain
should
still
be
awake
then
a
faint
light
from
the
rising
moon
appearing
towards
the
east
he
crept
from
his
perch
and
crossing
the
gangway
reached
the
wharf
and
presently
his
boat
ten
minutes
later
he
was
on
board
the
launch
chapter
a
change
of
venue
still
making
as
little
noise
as
possible
hilliard
descended
to
the
cabin
and
turned
in
merriman
was
asleep
and
the
quiet
movement
of
the
other
did
not
awaken
him
but
hilliard
was
in
no
frame
of
mind
for
repose
he
was
too
much
thrilled
by
the
adventure
through
which
he
had
passed
and
the
discovery
which
he
had
made
he
therefore
put
away
the
idea
of
sleep
and
instead
gave
himself
up
to
consideration
of
the
situation
he
began
by
trying
to
marshal
the
facts
he
had
already
learned
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
great
outstanding
point
that
his
suspicions
were
well
founded
that
some
secret
and
mysterious
business
was
being
carried
on
by
this
syndicate
not
only
therefore
was
he
justified
in
all
he
had
done
up
to
the
present
but
it
was
clear
he
could
not
leave
the
matter
where
it
stood
either
he
must
continue
his
investigations
further
or
he
must
report
to
headquarters
what
he
had
overheard
next
it
seemed
likely
that
the
syndicate
consisted
of
at
least
six
persons
captain
beamish
probably
from
his
personality
the
leader
bulla
coburn
henri
and
the
two
men
to
whom
reference
had
been
made
archer
who
had
suggested
forming
the
depot
at
swansea
and
morton
who
had
been
asked
to
make
inquiries
as
to
himself
and
merriman
madeleine
coburn
name
had
also
been
mentioned
and
hilliard
wondered
whether
she
could
be
a
member
like
his
companion
he
could
not
believe
that
she
would
be
willingly
involved
but
on
the
other
hand
coburn
had
stated
that
she
had
reported
her
suspicion
that
merriman
had
noticed
the
changed
number
plate
hilliard
could
come
to
no
conclusion
about
her
but
it
remained
clear
that
there
were
certainly
four
members
and
probably
six
or
more
but
if
so
it
followed
that
the
operations
must
be
on
a
fairly
large
scale
educated
men
did
not
take
up
a
risky
and
presumably
illegal
enterprise
unless
the
prize
was
worth
having
it
was
unlikely
that
pounds
a
year
would
compensate
any
one
of
them
for
the
risk
but
that
would
mean
a
profit
of
from
to
pounds
a
year
hilliard
realized
that
he
was
here
on
shaky
ground
though
the
balance
of
probability
was
in
his
favor
it
also
seemed
certain
that
the
whole
business
was
a
sham
a
mere
blind
to
cover
those
other
operations
from
which
the
money
came
but
when
hilliard
came
to
ask
himself
what
those
operations
were
he
found
himself
up
against
a
more
difficult
proposition
his
original
brandy
smuggling
idea
recurred
to
him
with
renewed
force
and
as
he
pondered
it
he
saw
that
there
really
was
something
to
be
said
for
it
three
distinct
considerations
were
consistent
with
the
theory
there
was
first
of
all
the
size
of
the
fraud
a
theft
of
to
or
more
a
year
implied
as
victim
a
large
corporation
the
sum
would
be
too
big
a
proportion
of
the
income
of
a
firm
for
the
matter
to
remain
undiscovered
and
other
things
being
equal
the
larger
the
corporation
the
more
difficult
to
locate
the
leakage
but
what
larger
corporation
was
there
than
a
nation
and
what
so
easy
to
defraud
as
a
government
and
how
could
a
government
be
more
easily
defrauded
than
by
smuggling
here
again
hilliard
recognized
he
was
only
theorizing
still
the
point
had
a
certain
weight
the
second
consideration
was
also
inconclusive
it
was
that
all
the
people
who
he
had
so
far
learned
were
involved
were
engaged
in
transport
operations
the
ostensible
trade
also
the
blind
under
which
the
thing
was
worked
was
a
transport
trade
if
brandy
smuggling
were
in
progress
something
of
precisely
this
kind
would
have
to
be
devised
in
fact
anything
more
suitable
than
the
business
would
be
hard
to
discover
the
third
point
he
had
thought
of
before
if
brandy
were
to
be
smuggled
no
better
locality
could
have
been
found
for
the
venture
than
this
country
round
about
bordeaux
as
one
of
the
staple
products
of
the
district
brandy
could
be
obtained
here
possibly
more
easily
than
anywhere
else
the
converse
argument
was
equally
inconclusive
what
hypothesis
other
than
that
of
brandy
smuggling
could
meet
the
facts
hilliard
could
not
think
of
any
but
he
recognized
that
his
failure
did
not
prove
that
none
existed
on
the
other
hand
in
spite
of
these
considerations
he
had
to
admit
that
he
had
seen
nothing
which
in
the
slightest
degree
supported
the
theory
nor
had
he
heard
anything
which
could
not
equally
well
have
referred
to
something
else
but
whatever
their
objective
he
felt
sure
that
the
members
of
the
syndicate
were
desperate
men
they
were
evidently
too
far
committed
to
hesitate
over
fresh
crime
to
keep
their
secret
if
he
wished
to
pursue
his
investigations
it
was
up
to
him
to
do
so
without
arousing
their
suspicions
as
he
pondered
over
the
problem
of
how
this
was
to
be
done
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
its
difficulty
such
an
inquiry
to
a
trained
detective
could
not
be
easy
but
to
him
an
amateur
at
the
game
it
seemed
impossible
and
particularly
he
found
himself
handicapped
by
the
intimate
terms
with
the
coburns
on
which
he
and
merriman
found
themselves
for
instance
that
very
morning
an
excursion
had
been
arranged
to
an
old
chateau
near
bordeaux
how
could
he
refuse
to
go
and
if
he
went
how
could
he
watch
the
loading
of
the
girondin
he
had
suspected
before
that
the
coburns
hospitality
was
due
to
something
other
than
friendliness
and
now
he
was
sure
of
it
no
longer
had
he
any
doubt
that
the
object
was
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
to
create
that
very
obstacle
to
investigation
which
it
had
created
and
here
again
miss
coburn
had
undoubtedly
lent
herself
to
the
plot
he
was
not
long
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sooner
he
and
merriman
took
leave
of
the
coburns
the
better
besides
this
question
of
handicap
he
was
afraid
with
so
astute
a
man
as
coburn
he
would
sooner
or
later
give
himself
away
the
thought
led
to
another
would
it
not
be
wise
to
keep
merriman
in
ignorance
of
what
he
had
learned
at
least
for
the
present
merriman
was
an
open
straightforward
chap
transparently
honest
in
all
his
dealings
could
he
dissemble
sufficiently
to
hide
his
knowledge
from
his
hosts
in
particular
could
he
deceive
madeleine
hilliard
doubted
it
he
felt
that
under
the
special
circumstances
his
friend
discretion
could
not
be
relied
on
at
all
events
merriman
appearance
of
ignorance
would
be
more
convincing
if
it
were
genuine
on
the
whole
hilliard
decided
it
would
be
better
not
to
tell
him
let
them
once
get
away
from
the
neighborhood
and
he
could
share
his
discoveries
and
they
could
together
decide
what
was
to
be
done
but
first
to
get
away
accordingly
next
morning
he
broached
the
subject
he
had
expected
his
friend
would
strenuously
oppose
any
plan
involving
separation
from
madeleine
coburn
but
to
his
relief
merriman
immediately
agreed
with
him
i
been
thinking
we
ought
to
clear
out
too
he
declared
ungrammatically
it
not
good
enough
to
be
accepting
continuous
hospitality
which
you
ca
hilliard
assented
carelessly
remarked
that
if
they
started
the
following
morning
they
could
reach
the
riviera
by
the
following
friday
and
let
it
go
at
that
he
did
not
refer
again
to
the
subject
until
they
reached
the
coburns
door
when
he
asked
quickly
by
the
way
will
you
tell
them
we
leaving
tomorrow
or
shall
i
i
will
said
merriman
to
his
relief
the
girondin
was
loading
props
as
they
set
out
in
the
ford
car
and
the
work
was
still
in
progress
on
their
return
in
the
late
afternoon
coburn
had
excused
himself
from
joining
the
party
on
the
ground
of
business
but
captain
beamish
had
taken
his
place
and
had
proved
himself
a
surprisingly
entertaining
companion
at
the
old
chateau
they
had
a
pleasant
alfresco
lunch
after
which
captain
beamish
took
a
number
of
photographs
of
the
party
with
his
pocket
kodak
merriman
announcement
of
his
and
hilliard
impending
departure
had
been
met
with
a
chorus
of
regrets
but
though
these
sounded
hearty
enough
hilliard
noticed
that
no
definite
invitation
to
stay
longer
was
given
the
friends
dined
with
the
coburns
for
the
last
time
that
evening
coburn
was
a
little
late
for
the
meal
saying
he
had
waited
on
the
wharf
to
see
the
loading
completed
and
that
all
the
cargo
was
now
aboard
and
that
the
girondin
would
drop
down
to
sea
on
the
flood
tide
in
the
early
morning
we
shall
have
her
company
so
far
hilliard
remarked
we
must
start
early
too
so
as
to
make
bordeaux
before
when
the
time
came
to
say
coburn
and
his
daughter
went
down
to
the
launch
with
their
departing
visitors
hilliard
was
careful
to
monopolize
the
manager
attention
so
as
to
give
merriman
his
innings
with
the
girl
his
friend
did
not
tell
him
what
passed
between
them
but
the
parting
was
evidently
affecting
as
merriman
retired
to
his
locker
practically
in
silence
five
next
morning
saw
the
friends
astir
and
their
first
sight
on
reaching
the
deck
was
the
girondin
coming
they
exchanged
hand
waves
with
captain
beamish
on
the
bridge
then
swinging
their
own
craft
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
other
a
couple
of
hours
later
they
were
at
sea
once
again
they
were
lucky
in
their
weather
a
sun
of
molten
glory
poured
down
from
the
clearest
of
blue
skies
burnishing
a
track
of
intolerable
brilliance
across
the
water
hardly
a
ripple
appeared
on
the
smooth
surface
though
they
rose
and
fell
gently
to
the
flat
ocean
swell
they
were
running
up
the
coast
about
four
miles
out
and
except
for
the
girondin
now
almost
hull
down
to
the
they
had
the
sea
to
themselves
it
was
hot
enough
to
make
the
breeze
caused
by
the
launch
progress
pleasantly
cool
and
both
men
lay
smoking
on
the
deck
lazily
watching
the
water
and
enjoying
the
easy
motion
hilliard
had
made
the
wheel
fast
and
reached
up
every
now
and
then
to
give
it
a
slight
turn
jolly
i
call
this
he
exclaimed
as
he
lay
down
again
after
one
of
these
interruptions
jolly
sun
jolly
sea
jolly
everything
is
it
rather
even
a
landlubber
like
me
can
appreciate
it
but
you
often
have
it
like
this
i
oh
i
do
know
hilliard
answered
absently
and
then
swinging
round
and
facing
his
friend
he
went
on
i
say
merriman
i
something
to
tell
you
that
will
interest
you
but
i
afraid
it
wo
please
merriman
laughed
contentedly
you
arouse
my
curiosity
anyway
he
declared
get
on
and
let
hear
hilliard
answered
quietly
but
he
felt
excitement
arising
in
him
as
he
thought
of
the
disclosure
he
was
about
to
make
first
of
all
he
began
speaking
more
and
more
earnestly
as
he
proceeded
i
have
to
make
you
an
apology
i
quite
deliberately
deceived
you
up
at
the
clearing
or
rather
i
withheld
from
you
knowledge
that
i
ought
to
have
shared
i
had
a
reason
for
it
but
i
do
know
if
agree
that
it
was
tell
you
remember
the
night
before
last
when
i
rowed
up
to
the
wharf
after
we
had
left
the
coburns
you
thought
my
suspicions
were
absurd
or
worse
well
they
were
i
made
a
merriman
sat
up
eagerly
and
listened
intently
as
the
other
recounted
his
adventure
aboard
the
girondin
hilliard
kept
nothing
back
even
the
reference
to
madeleine
he
repeated
as
nearly
word
for
word
as
possible
finally
giving
a
bowdlerized
version
of
his
reasons
for
keeping
his
discoveries
to
himself
while
they
remained
in
the
neighborhood
merriman
received
the
news
with
a
dismay
approaching
positive
horror
he
had
but
one
thought
madeleine
how
did
the
situation
affect
her
was
she
in
trouble
in
danger
was
she
so
entangled
that
she
could
not
get
out
never
for
a
moment
did
it
enter
his
head
that
she
could
be
willingly
involved
my
goodness
hilliard
he
cried
hoarsely
whatever
does
it
all
mean
surely
it
ca
be
criminal
they
he
hesitated
slightly
and
hilliard
read
in
a
different
pronoun
they
never
would
join
in
such
a
hilliard
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
that
miss
coburn
would
take
part
in
anything
shady
i
do
for
a
moment
believe
he
declared
but
i
afraid
i
would
be
so
sure
of
her
merriman
shook
his
head
and
groaned
i
know
you
right
he
admitted
to
the
other
amazement
i
saw
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
but
now
i
may
as
well
that
first
evening
when
we
went
up
to
call
you
probably
do
remember
but
after
he
had
learned
who
we
were
he
turned
round
to
pull
up
a
chair
he
looked
at
you
i
saw
his
face
in
a
mirror
hilliard
it
was
the
face
of
a
i
was
going
to
say
a
devil
with
hate
and
fear
but
the
look
passed
instantly
when
he
turned
round
he
was
smiling
it
was
so
quick
i
half
thought
i
was
mistaken
but
i
know
i
i
saw
fear
on
his
face
when
he
recognized
you
that
same
evening
hilliard
replied
we
need
blink
at
it
merriman
whether
willingly
or
unwillingly
coburn
in
the
thing
that
as
certain
as
that
we
but
what
is
it
have
you
any
theory
no
not
really
there
was
that
one
of
brandy
smuggling
that
i
mentioned
before
i
suggest
it
because
i
can
suggest
nothing
else
but
i
admit
i
saw
no
evidence
of
merriman
was
silent
for
several
minutes
as
the
boat
slid
over
the
smooth
water
then
with
a
change
of
manner
he
turned
once
more
to
his
friend
i
suppose
we
could
leave
it
alone
is
it
our
business
after
all
if
we
do
act
we
become
accessories
and
besides
we
leave
that
girl
to
fight
her
own
merriman
clenched
his
fists
and
once
more
silence
reigned
presently
he
spoke
again
you
had
something
in
your
mind
i
think
we
must
do
one
of
two
things
either
continue
our
investigations
until
we
learn
what
is
going
on
or
else
clear
out
and
tell
the
police
what
we
have
merriman
made
a
gesture
of
dissent
not
that
not
that
he
cried
anything
rather
than
the
hilliard
gazed
vacantly
on
the
long
line
of
the
coast
look
here
old
man
he
said
would
it
be
better
if
we
discussed
this
thing
quite
directly
do
think
i
mean
to
be
impertinent
god
knows
i
do
but
am
i
not
right
in
thinking
you
want
to
save
miss
coburn
all
annoyance
and
her
father
also
for
her
sake
we
need
talk
about
it
again
merriman
said
in
a
hard
voice
looking
intently
at
the
stem
of
the
mast
but
if
it
necessary
to
make
things
clear
i
want
to
marry
her
if
she
have
i
thought
so
old
man
and
i
can
only
say
the
best
of
luck
as
you
say
then
we
must
call
in
the
police
and
as
we
ca
leave
the
thing
we
must
go
on
with
our
own
inquiry
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
find
out
their
scheme
is
something
illegal
we
see
coburn
and
give
him
the
chance
to
get
out
before
we
lodge
our
i
suppose
that
is
the
only
way
merriman
said
doubtfully
after
a
pause
hilliard
went
on
i
not
very
clear
but
i
inclined
to
think
we
can
do
no
more
good
here
at
present
i
think
we
should
try
the
other
the
other
end
yes
the
unloading
of
the
ship
and
the
disposal
of
the
you
see
the
first
thing
we
up
against
is
that
these
people
are
anything
but
fools
and
the
second
is
that
they
already
suspect
us
and
will
keep
a
watch
on
us
a
hundred
to
one
they
make
inquiries
and
see
that
we
really
do
go
through
the
canal
du
midi
to
the
riviera
we
ca
hang
about
bordeaux
without
their
knowing
that
of
course
hilliard
went
on
we
can
see
now
we
made
a
frightful
mess
of
things
by
calling
on
the
coburns
or
letting
coburn
know
we
were
about
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
the
wisest
it
was
the
only
thing
merriman
asserted
positively
we
did
know
then
there
was
anything
wrong
and
besides
how
could
we
have
hidden
the
launch
well
it
done
anyway
we
need
worry
about
it
now
except
that
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
same
reason
the
launch
has
served
its
purpose
we
ca
use
it
here
because
the
people
at
the
clearing
know
it
and
we
ca
use
it
at
the
unloading
end
for
all
on
board
the
girondin
would
recognize
it
directly
they
saw
merriman
nodded
without
speaking
and
hilliard
continued
i
think
therefore
that
we
should
leave
the
launch
at
bordeaux
tonight
and
go
back
to
london
overland
i
shall
write
coburn
saying
we
have
found
poste
restante
letters
recalling
us
you
can
enclose
a
note
to
miss
coburn
if
you
like
when
we
get
to
town
we
can
apply
at
the
inquiry
office
at
lloyd
to
find
out
where
the
girondin
calls
in
england
then
let
us
go
there
and
make
inquiries
the
launch
can
be
worked
back
to
england
some
other
time
how
does
that
strike
you
seems
all
right
but
i
should
leave
the
launch
at
bordeaux
we
may
have
to
come
back
and
it
would
furnish
us
with
an
excuse
for
our
presence
if
we
were
hilliard
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
merriman
reply
took
a
weight
off
his
mind
not
because
of
the
value
of
the
suggestion
though
in
its
way
it
was
quite
useful
but
because
of
its
indication
of
frame
of
mind
he
had
feared
that
because
of
miss
coburn
connection
with
the
affair
he
would
lose
his
friend
help
even
that
they
might
quarrel
and
now
he
saw
these
fears
were
groundless
thankfully
he
recognized
that
they
would
as
they
had
originally
intended
jolly
good
notion
that
he
answered
cordially
i
confess
merriman
went
on
slowly
that
i
should
have
liked
to
stay
in
the
neighborhood
and
see
if
we
could
find
out
something
more
about
the
lorry
numbers
it
may
be
a
trivial
point
but
it
the
only
direct
and
definite
thing
we
know
of
all
the
rest
are
hints
or
suspicions
or
probabilities
but
here
we
have
a
bit
of
mystery
tangible
in
our
hands
as
it
were
why
were
those
number
plates
changed
it
seems
to
me
a
good
point
of
i
thought
of
that
too
and
i
agree
with
every
word
you
say
hilliard
replied
eagerly
but
there
is
the
question
of
our
being
suspects
i
believe
we
shall
be
watched
out
of
the
place
and
i
feel
sure
our
only
chance
of
learning
anything
is
to
satisfy
them
of
our
bona
merriman
agreed
and
they
continued
discussing
the
matter
in
detail
at
last
deciding
to
adopt
hilliard
suggestion
and
set
to
work
on
the
english
end
of
the
mysterious
traffic
about
two
that
afternoon
they
swung
round
the
pointe
de
grave
into
the
estuary
of
the
gironde
the
tide
which
was
then
flowing
turned
when
they
were
some
of
the
way
up
and
it
was
well
on
to
seven
when
they
made
fast
to
the
same
decaying
wharf
from
which
they
had
set
out
hilliard
saw
the
owner
and
arranged
with
him
to
let
the
launch
lie
at
one
of
his
moorings
until
she
should
be
required
then
the
friends
went
up
town
got
some
dinner
wrote
their
letters
and
took
the
night
train
for
paris
next
evening
they
were
in
london
i
say
hilliard
remarked
when
later
on
that
same
evening
they
sat
in
his
rooms
discussing
their
plans
i
believe
we
can
find
out
about
the
girondin
now
my
neighbor
on
the
next
landing
above
is
a
shipping
man
he
might
have
a
copy
of
lloyd
register
i
shall
go
and
ask
in
a
few
moments
he
returned
with
a
bulky
volume
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
this
i
always
think
he
said
as
he
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
it
gives
or
is
supposed
to
give
information
about
everything
over
a
hundred
tons
that
floats
anywhere
over
the
entire
globe
give
the
girondin
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
columns
ah
what
this
motor
ship
girondin
tons
built
and
so
on
landes
syndicate
ferriby
hull
hull
my
son
there
we
hull
i
know
hull
merriman
remarked
laconically
at
least
i
was
there
we
shall
know
it
a
jolly
sight
better
than
that
before
we
through
it
seems
to
me
his
friend
replied
let
hope
so
what
the
plan
then
i
on
provided
i
have
a
good
sleep
at
home
tonight
same
here
hilliard
agreed
as
he
filled
his
pipe
i
suppose
hull
by
an
early
train
tomorrow
is
the
merriman
borrowed
his
friend
pouch
and
refilled
his
pipe
in
his
turn
you
think
so
he
said
slowly
well
i
not
so
sure
seems
to
me
we
can
very
easily
dish
ourselves
if
we
not
how
so
we
agreed
these
folk
were
and
suspicious
of
us
very
well
directly
our
visit
to
them
is
over
we
change
our
plans
and
leave
bordeaux
will
it
not
strike
them
that
our
interest
in
the
trip
was
only
on
their
account
i
do
see
it
we
gave
a
good
reason
for
quite
that
what
i
coming
to
we
told
them
you
were
recalled
to
your
office
but
what
about
that
man
morton
that
was
to
spy
on
us
before
what
to
prevent
them
asking
him
if
you
really
have
returned
hilliard
sat
up
sharply
by
jove
he
cried
i
never
thought
of
and
there
another
thing
merriman
went
on
we
turn
up
at
hull
find
the
syndicate
depot
and
hang
about
the
fellow
in
charge
there
sees
us
well
that
all
right
if
he
has
had
a
letter
from
france
describing
us
and
enclosing
a
copy
of
that
group
that
captain
beamish
took
at
the
hilliard
whistled
lord
it
not
going
to
be
so
simple
as
it
looks
is
it
it
is
and
what
more
we
ca
afford
to
make
any
mistakes
too
hilliard
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
i
do
care
he
declared
savagely
i
going
through
with
it
now
no
matter
what
oh
so
am
i
for
the
matter
of
that
all
i
say
is
we
shall
have
to
show
a
bit
more
intelligence
this
for
an
hour
more
they
discussed
the
matter
and
at
last
decided
on
a
plan
on
the
following
morning
hilliard
was
to
go
to
his
office
see
his
chief
and
ask
for
an
extension
of
leave
then
hang
about
and
interview
as
many
of
his
colleagues
as
possible
telling
them
he
had
been
recalled
but
was
not
now
required
his
chief
was
not
very
approachable
and
hilliard
felt
sure
the
subject
would
not
be
broached
to
him
in
the
evening
they
would
go
down
to
hull
this
program
they
would
have
carried
out
but
for
an
unforeseen
event
while
hilliard
was
visiting
his
office
merriman
took
the
opportunity
to
call
at
his
and
there
learned
that
edwards
his
partner
had
been
taken
ill
the
morning
before
it
appeared
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
and
edwards
expected
to
be
back
at
work
in
three
or
four
days
but
until
his
return
merriman
was
required
and
he
had
reluctantly
to
telephone
the
news
to
hilliard
but
no
part
of
their
combined
holiday
was
lost
hilliard
by
a
stroke
of
unexpected
good
fortune
was
able
to
spend
the
same
time
at
work
and
postpone
the
remainder
of
his
leave
until
merriman
was
free
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
not
until
six
days
later
than
they
had
intended
that
the
two
friends
packed
their
bags
for
hull
they
left
king
cross
by
the
train
reaching
their
destination
a
little
before
eleven
there
they
took
rooms
at
the
george
a
quiet
hotel
in
baker
street
close
to
the
paragon
station
chapter
the
ferriby
depot
the
two
friends
eager
and
excited
by
their
adventure
were
early
astir
next
morning
and
after
breakfast
hilliard
went
out
and
bought
the
best
map
of
the
city
and
district
he
could
find
why
ferriby
not
in
the
town
at
all
he
exclaimed
after
he
had
studied
it
for
some
moments
it
up
the
river
must
be
seven
or
eight
miles
up
by
the
look
of
it
the
runs
through
it
and
there
a
station
we
better
go
out
there
and
merriman
agreed
they
called
for
a
timetable
found
there
was
a
train
at
and
going
down
to
paragon
station
got
on
board
after
clearing
the
suburbs
the
line
came
down
close
to
the
river
and
the
two
friends
kept
a
good
for
the
depot
about
four
and
a
half
miles
out
they
stopped
at
a
station
called
hassle
then
a
couple
of
miles
farther
their
perseverance
was
rewarded
and
they
saw
a
small
pier
and
shed
the
latter
bearing
in
large
letters
on
its
roof
the
name
of
the
syndicate
another
mile
and
a
half
brought
them
to
ferriby
where
they
alighted
now
what
about
walking
back
to
hassle
hilliard
suggested
and
seeing
what
we
can
see
they
followed
the
station
approach
road
inland
until
they
reached
the
main
thoroughfare
along
which
they
turned
eastwards
in
the
direction
of
hull
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
in
sight
of
the
depot
half
a
mile
off
across
the
fields
a
lane
led
towards
it
and
this
they
followed
until
it
reached
the
railway
from
ferriby
to
main
road

signal
box
the
river
humber
there
it
turned
in
the
direction
of
hull
and
ran
parallel
to
the
line
for
a
short
distance
doubling
back
as
they
learned
afterwards
until
it
reached
the
main
road
to
hassle
the
railway
tracks
were
on
a
low
bank
and
the
men
could
just
see
across
them
to
the
headquarters
the
view
was
not
very
good
but
so
far
as
they
could
make
out
the
depot
was
a
replica
of
that
in
the
landes
clearing
a
timber
wharf
jutted
out
into
the
stream
apparently
of
the
same
size
and
construction
as
that
on
the
river
lesque
behind
it
was
the
same
kind
of
galvanized
iron
shed
but
this
one
besides
having
windows
in
the
gables
seemed
the
smaller
of
the
two
its
back
was
only
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
railway
and
the
space
between
was
taken
up
by
a
yard
surrounded
by
a
high
galvanized
iron
fence
above
which
appeared
the
tops
of
many
stacks
of
into
the
yard
ran
a
siding
from
the
railway
from
a
door
in
the
fence
a
path
led
across
the
line
to
a
wicket
in
the
hedge
of
the
lane
beside
which
stood
a
beware
of
the
trains
notice
there
was
no
sign
of
activity
about
the
place
and
the
gates
through
which
the
siding
entered
the
enclosure
were
shut
hilliard
stopped
and
stood
looking
over
how
the
mischief
are
we
to
get
near
that
place
without
being
seen
he
questioned
it
like
a
german
there
no
cover
anywhere
it
was
true
the
country
immediately
surrounding
the
depot
was
singularly
bare
it
was
flat
except
for
the
low
bank
four
or
five
feet
high
on
which
lay
the
railway
tracks
there
were
clumps
of
trees
farther
inland
but
none
along
the
shore
and
the
nearest
building
a
large
block
like
a
factory
with
beside
it
a
cottage
was
at
least
three
hundred
yards
away
in
the
hull
direction
seems
an
element
of
design
in
that
eh
hilliard
merriman
remarked
as
they
turned
to
continue
their
walk
considering
the
populous
country
we
in
you
could
hardly
find
a
more
isolated
hilliard
nodded
as
they
turned
away
i
just
been
thinking
that
they
could
carry
on
any
tricks
they
liked
there
and
no
one
would
be
a
bit
the
they
moved
on
towards
the
building
it
was
on
the
inland
side
of
the
railway
and
the
lane
swung
away
from
the
line
and
passed
what
was
evidently
its
frontage
a
siding
ran
into
its
rear
and
there
were
connections
across
the
main
lines
and
a
signal
cabin
in
the
distance
a
few
yards
on
the
nearer
side
stood
the
cottage
which
they
now
saw
was
empty
and
dilapidated
i
say
hilliard
look
there
cried
merriman
suddenly
they
had
passed
along
the
lane
until
the
facade
of
the
building
had
come
into
view
and
they
were
able
to
read
its
signboard
ackroyd
bolt
licensed
i
thought
it
looked
like
a
distillery
continued
merriman
in
considerable
excitement
by
jove
hilliard
that
a
find
and
no
mistake
pretty
suggestive
that
is
it
hilliard
was
not
so
enthusiastic
i
not
so
sure
he
said
slowly
you
mean
that
it
supports
my
brandy
smuggling
theory
just
how
well
what
do
you
think
yourself
we
suspect
brandy
smuggling
and
here
we
find
at
the
import
end
of
the
concern
the
nearest
building
in
an
isolated
region
is
a
distillery
a
rectifying
house
mind
you
that
a
matter
of
design
too
how
better
could
they
dispose
of
their
stuff
than
by
dumping
it
on
to
rectifiers
you
distinguish
between
distillers
and
rectifiers
certainly
there
less
check
on
rectifiers
am
i
not
right
in
saying
that
while
the
regulations
for
the
measurement
of
spirit
actually
produced
from
the
stills
are
so
thorough
as
to
make
fraud
almost
impossible
rectifiers
because
they
do
themselves
produce
spirit
but
merely
refine
what
other
firms
have
produced
are
not
so
strictly
looked
after
rectifiers
would
surely
find
smuggled
stuff
easier
to
dispose
of
than
hilliard
shook
his
head
perhaps
so
theoretically
he
admitted
but
in
practice
nothing
in
it
neither
could
work
a
fraud
like
that
for
both
are
watched
far
too
closely
by
our
people
i
afraid
i
do
see
that
this
place
being
here
helps
us
surely
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
same
cause
brought
ackroyd
bolt
that
attracted
the
syndicate
just
that
it
a
good
site
where
in
the
district
could
you
get
a
better
cheap
ground
and
plenty
of
it
and
steamer
and
rail
it
a
coincidence
i
do
see
it
in
any
case
unless
we
can
prove
that
the
ship
brings
brandy
the
question
does
merriman
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
a
blow
he
remarked
and
i
was
so
sure
i
had
got
hold
of
something
good
but
it
just
leads
us
back
to
the
question
that
somehow
or
other
we
must
inspect
that
depot
and
if
we
find
nothing
we
must
watch
the
girondin
unloading
if
we
can
only
get
near
enough
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
discharge
anything
in
bulk
without
our
seeing
hilliard
murmured
an
agreement
and
the
two
men
strolled
on
in
silence
the
thoughts
of
each
busy
with
the
problem
merriman
had
set
both
were
realizing
that
detective
work
was
a
very
much
more
difficult
business
than
they
had
imagined
had
not
each
had
a
strong
motive
for
continuing
the
investigation
it
is
possible
they
might
have
grown
fainthearted
but
hilliard
had
before
him
the
vision
of
the
kudos
which
would
accrue
to
him
if
he
could
unmask
a
conspiracy
while
to
merriman
the
freeing
of
madeleine
coburn
from
the
toils
in
which
she
seemed
to
have
been
enmeshed
had
become
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
in
the
world
the
two
friends
had
already
left
the
distillery
half
a
mile
behind
when
hilliard
stopped
and
looked
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
to
twelve
he
announced
as
we
have
nothing
to
do
go
back
and
watch
that
place
something
may
happen
during
the
afternoon
and
if
not
we
look
out
for
the
workmen
leaving
and
see
if
we
can
pick
up
something
from
they
retraced
their
steps
past
the
distillery
and
depot
then
creeping
into
a
little
wood
sat
down
on
a
bank
within
sight
of
the
enclosure
and
waited
the
day
was
hot
and
somewhat
enervating
and
both
enjoyed
the
relaxation
in
the
cool
shade
they
sat
for
the
most
part
in
silence
smoking
steadily
and
turning
over
in
their
minds
the
problems
with
which
they
were
faced
before
them
the
country
sloped
gently
down
to
the
railway
bank
along
the
top
of
which
the
polished
edges
of
the
rails
gleamed
in
the
midday
sun
beyond
was
the
wide
expanse
of
the
river
with
a
dazzling
track
of
shimmering
gold
stretching
across
it
and
hiding
the
farther
shore
with
its
brilliancy
a
few
small
boats
moved
slowly
near
the
shore
while
farther
out
an
occasional
large
steamer
came
into
view
going
up
the
fairway
to
goole
every
now
and
then
trains
roared
past
the
steam
hardly
visible
in
the
dry
air
the
afternoon
dragged
slowly
but
not
unpleasantly
away
until
about
five
they
observed
the
first
sign
of
activity
about
the
depot
which
had
taken
place
since
their
arrival
the
door
in
the
galvanized
fence
opened
and
five
figures
emerged
and
slowly
crossed
the
railway
they
paused
for
a
moment
after
reaching
the
lane
then
separated
four
going
eastwards
towards
the
distillery
the
fifth
coming
north
towards
the
point
at
which
the
watchers
were
concealed
the
latter
thereupon
moved
out
from
their
hiding
place
on
to
the
road
the
fifth
figure
resolved
itself
into
that
of
a
man
of
the
laboring
class
slow
heavy
and
obese
in
his
rather
bovine
countenance
hardly
any
spark
of
intelligence
shone
he
did
not
appear
to
have
seen
the
others
as
he
approached
but
evinced
neither
surprise
nor
interest
when
hilliard
accosted
him
any
place
about
here
you
can
get
a
drink
the
man
slowly
jerked
his
head
to
the
left
oop
in
village
he
answered
raven
come
along
and
show
us
the
way
and
have
a
drink
with
us
hilliard
invited
the
man
grasped
this
and
his
eyes
gleamed
ay
he
replied
succinctly
as
they
walked
hilliard
attempted
light
conversation
but
without
eliciting
much
response
from
their
new
acquaintance
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
consumed
his
third
bottle
of
beer
that
his
tongue
became
somewhat
looser
any
chance
of
a
job
where
you
working
hilliard
went
on
my
pal
and
i
would
be
glad
to
pick
up
the
man
shook
his
head
apparently
noticing
nothing
incongruous
in
the
question
do
think
no
harm
in
asking
the
boss
anyway
where
might
we
find
him
down
at
works
likely
he
be
there
most
i
rather
go
to
his
house
can
you
tell
where
he
lives
ay
down
at
but
he
does
sleep
at
the
works
surely
ay
sleeps
in
tin
the
friends
exchanged
glances
their
problem
was
even
more
difficult
than
they
had
supposed
a
secret
inspection
seemed
more
and
more
unattainable
hilliard
continued
the
laborious
conversation
we
thought
there
might
be
some
stevedoring
to
do
you
a
steamer
in
now
and
then
have
you
the
man
admitted
it
and
after
a
deal
of
wearisome
questioning
they
learned
that
the
girondin
called
about
every
ten
days
remaining
for
about
hours
and
that
she
was
due
in
three
or
four
days
finding
they
could
get
no
further
information
out
of
him
they
left
their
bovine
acquaintance
with
a
fresh
supply
of
beer
and
returning
to
the
station
took
the
first
train
back
to
hull
as
they
sat
smoking
that
evening
after
dinner
they
once
more
attacked
the
problem
which
was
baffling
them
it
seems
to
me
hilliard
asserted
that
we
should
concentrate
on
the
smuggling
idea
first
not
because
i
quite
believe
in
it
but
because
it
the
only
one
we
have
and
that
brings
us
again
to
the
same
point
the
unloading
of
the
merriman
not
replying
he
continued
any
attempt
involves
a
preliminary
visit
to
see
how
the
land
lies
now
we
ca
approach
that
place
in
the
daytime
if
we
try
to
slip
round
secretly
we
shall
be
spotted
from
those
windows
or
from
the
wharf
on
the
other
hand
if
we
invent
some
tale
and
go
openly
we
give
ourselves
away
if
they
have
our
descriptions
or
photographs
therefore
we
must
go
at
well
obviously
we
can
only
approach
the
place
by
land
or
water
if
we
go
by
land
we
have
either
to
shin
up
on
the
pier
from
the
shore
which
not
certain
we
can
do
or
else
risk
making
a
noise
climbing
over
the
galvanized
iron
fence
besides
we
might
leave
footmarks
or
other
traces
but
if
we
go
by
water
we
can
muffle
our
oars
and
drop
down
absolutely
silently
to
the
wharf
there
are
bound
to
be
steps
and
it
would
be
easy
to
get
up
without
making
any
merriman
emphatic
nod
expressed
his
approval
good
he
cried
warmly
what
about
getting
a
boat
and
having
a
try
that
night
i
think
we
should
there
another
thing
about
it
too
if
there
should
be
an
alarm
we
could
get
away
by
the
river
far
more
easily
than
across
the
country
it
a
blessing
there
no
next
day
the
object
of
their
search
was
changed
they
wanted
a
small
handy
skiff
on
hire
it
did
not
turn
out
an
easy
quest
but
by
the
late
afternoon
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
desired
article
they
purchased
also
caps
and
shoes
together
with
some
food
for
the
night
a
couple
of
electric
torches
and
a
yard
of
black
cloth
then
shortly
before
dusk
began
to
fall
they
took
their
places
and
pulled
out
on
the
great
stream
it
was
a
pleasant
evening
a
fitting
close
to
a
glorious
day
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
and
a
faint
haze
hung
over
the
water
smoothing
and
blurring
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
buildings
of
the
town
and
turning
the
opposite
bank
into
a
gray
smudge
not
a
breath
was
stirring
and
the
water
lay
like
plate
glass
unbroken
by
the
faintest
ripple
the
spirit
of
adventure
was
high
in
the
two
men
as
they
pulled
down
the
great
avenue
of
burnished
gold
stretching
westwards
towards
the
sinking
sun
the
tide
was
flowing
and
but
slight
effort
was
needed
to
keep
them
moving
as
darkness
grew
they
came
nearer
inshore
until
in
the
fading
light
they
recognized
the
railway
station
at
hassle
there
they
ceased
rowing
drifting
slowly
onwards
until
the
last
faint
haze
of
light
had
disappeared
from
the
sky
they
had
carefully
muffled
their
oars
and
now
they
turned
north
and
began
sculling
gently
inshore
several
lights
had
come
out
and
presently
they
recognized
the
railway
signals
and
cabin
at
the
distillery
sidings
two
or
three
hundred
yards
more
said
hilliard
in
low
tones
they
were
now
close
to
the
beach
and
they
allowed
themselves
to
drift
on
until
the
dark
mass
of
the
wharf
loomed
up
ahead
then
hilliard
dipped
his
oars
and
brought
the
boat
silently
alongside
as
they
had
imagined
from
their
distant
view
of
it
the
wharf
was
identically
similar
in
construction
to
that
on
the
river
lesque
here
also
were
the
two
lines
of
piles
like
the
letter
v
one
in
front
vertical
the
other
raking
to
support
the
earthwork
behind
here
in
the
same
relative
position
were
the
steps
and
to
these
hilliard
made
fast
the
painter
with
a
slip
hitch
that
could
be
quickly
released
then
with
the
utmost
caution
both
men
stepped
ashore
and
slowly
mounting
the
steps
peeped
out
over
the
deck
of
the
wharf
as
far
as
they
could
make
out
in
the
gloom
the
arrangement
here
also
was
similar
to
that
in
france
lines
of
narrow
gauge
tramway
running
parallel
from
the
hut
towards
the
water
were
connected
along
the
front
of
the
wharf
by
a
cross
road
and
between
the
lines
were
stacks
of
and
decauville
trucks
stood
here
and
there
but
these
details
they
saw
afterwards
what
first
attracted
their
attention
was
that
lights
shone
in
the
third
and
fourth
windows
from
the
left
hand
end
of
the
shed
the
manager
evidently
was
still
about
we
go
back
to
the
boat
and
wait
hilliard
whispered
and
they
crept
down
the
steps
at
intervals
of
half
an
hour
one
or
other
climbed
up
and
had
a
look
at
the
windows
on
the
first
two
occasions
the
light
was
unchanged
on
the
third
it
had
moved
to
the
first
and
second
windows
and
on
the
fourth
it
had
gone
apparently
indicating
that
the
manager
had
moved
from
his
to
his
bedroom
and
retired
we
had
better
wait
at
least
an
hour
more
hilliard
whispered
again
time
passed
slowly
in
the
darkness
under
the
wharf
and
in
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
gentle
lapping
of
the
water
among
the
piles
the
boat
lay
almost
steady
except
when
a
movement
of
one
of
its
occupants
made
it
heel
slightly
over
and
started
a
series
of
tiny
ripples
it
was
not
cold
and
had
the
men
not
been
so
full
of
their
adventure
they
could
have
slept
at
intervals
hilliard
consulted
his
watch
but
it
was
not
until
the
hands
pointed
to
the
after
one
that
they
made
a
move
then
once
more
they
softly
ascended
to
the
wharf
above
the
sides
of
the
structure
were
protected
by
railings
which
ran
back
to
the
gables
of
the
tin
house
the
latter
stretching
entirely
across
the
base
of
the
pier
over
the
space
thus
enclosed
the
two
friends
passed
but
it
speedily
became
apparent
that
here
nothing
of
interest
was
to
be
found
beyond
the
stacks
of
props
and
wagons
there
was
literally
nothing
except
a
rusty
steam
winch
a
large
water
butt
into
which
was
led
the
down
spout
from
the
roof
a
tank
raised
on
a
stand
and
fitted
with
a
flexible
pipe
evidently
for
supplying
crude
oil
for
the
ship
engines
and
a
number
of
empty
barrels
in
which
the
oil
had
been
delivered
with
their
torch
carefully
screened
by
the
black
cloth
the
friends
examined
these
objects
particularly
the
oil
tank
which
forming
as
it
did
a
bridge
between
ship
and
shore
naturally
came
in
for
its
share
of
suspicion
but
they
were
soon
satisfied
that
neither
it
nor
any
of
the
other
objects
were
connected
with
their
quest
and
retreating
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
they
held
a
whispered
consultation
hilliard
was
for
attempting
to
open
one
of
the
doors
in
the
shed
at
the
end
away
from
the
manager
room
but
merriman
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
seeing
the
unloading
of
the
girondin
urged
that
the
contents
of
the
shed
were
secondary
and
that
their
efforts
should
be
confined
to
discovering
a
hiding
place
from
which
the
necessary
observations
could
be
made
if
there
was
any
way
of
getting
inside
one
of
these
stacks
of
props
he
said
we
could
keep
a
perfect
watch
i
could
get
in
now
for
example
you
relieve
me
tomorrow
night
i
relieve
you
the
next
night
and
so
on
nothing
could
be
unloaded
that
we
would
see
but
he
added
regretfully
i
doubt
even
if
we
could
get
inside
that
we
should
be
hidden
besides
they
might
take
a
notion
to
load
the
props
afraid
that
is
hardly
the
scheme
hilliard
answered
then
went
on
excitedly
but
there
that
barrel
perhaps
we
could
get
into
the
barrel
that
the
merriman
was
excited
in
his
turn
that
is
if
it
has
a
they
retraced
their
steps
with
the
tank
they
did
not
trouble
it
was
a
galvanized
iron
box
with
the
lid
riveted
on
and
moreover
was
full
of
oil
but
the
barrel
looked
feasible
it
was
an
exceptionally
large
cask
or
butt
with
a
lid
which
projected
over
its
upper
rim
and
which
entirely
protected
the
interior
from
view
it
was
placed
in
the
corner
beside
the
right
hand
gable
of
the
shed
that
is
the
opposite
end
of
the
manager
rooms
and
the
wooden
down
spout
from
the
roof
passed
in
through
a
slot
cut
in
the
edge
of
the
lid
a
more
ideal
position
for
an
observation
post
could
hardly
have
been
selected
try
to
lift
the
lid
whispered
hilliard
they
found
it
was
merely
laid
on
the
rim
cleats
nailed
on
below
preventing
it
from
slipping
off
they
raised
it
easily
and
hilliard
flashed
in
a
beam
from
his
electric
torch
the
cask
was
empty
evidently
a
result
of
the
long
drought
that
do
merriman
breathed
that
all
we
want
to
see
come
they
lowered
the
cover
and
stood
for
a
moment
hilliard
still
wanted
to
try
the
doors
of
the
shed
but
merriman
would
not
hear
of
it
come
away
he
whispered
again
we
done
well
why
spoil
it
they
returned
to
the
boat
and
there
argued
it
out
merriman
proposal
was
to
try
to
find
out
when
the
girondin
was
expected
then
come
the
night
before
bore
a
few
eyeholes
in
the
cask
and
let
one
of
them
properly
supplied
with
provisions
get
inside
and
assume
watch
the
other
one
would
row
away
rest
and
sleep
during
the
day
and
return
on
the
following
night
when
they
would
exchange
roles
and
so
on
until
the
girondin
left
in
this
way
he
asserted
they
must
infallibly
discover
the
truth
at
least
about
the
smuggling
do
you
think
we
could
stand
hours
in
that
barrel
hilliard
questioned
of
course
we
could
stand
it
we
got
to
come
on
hilliard
it
the
only
it
did
not
require
much
persuasion
to
get
hilliard
to
fall
in
with
the
proposal
and
they
untied
their
painter
and
pulled
silently
away
from
the
wharf
the
tide
had
turned
and
soon
they
relaxed
their
efforts
and
let
the
boat
drift
gently
downstream
the
first
faint
light
appeared
in
the
eastern
sky
as
they
floated
past
hassle
and
for
an
hour
afterwards
they
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
smoking
peacefully
and
entranced
by
the
gorgeous
pageant
of
the
coming
day
not
wishing
to
reach
hull
too
early
they
rowed
inshore
and
landing
in
a
little
bay
lay
down
in
the
lush
grass
and
slept
for
three
or
four
hours
then
they
pulled
and
drifted
on
until
between
seven
and
eight
they
reached
the
wharf
at
which
they
had
hired
their
boat
an
hour
later
they
were
back
at
their
hotel
recuperating
from
the
fatigues
of
the
night
with
the
help
of
cold
baths
and
a
substantial
breakfast
chapter
the
unloading
of
the
girondin
after
breakfast
hilliard
disappeared
he
went
out
ostensibly
to
post
a
letter
but
it
was
not
until
nearly
three
that
he
turned
up
again
sorry
old
man
he
greeted
merriman
but
when
i
was
going
to
the
post
office
this
morning
an
idea
struck
me
and
it
took
me
longer
to
follow
up
than
i
anticipated
i
tell
you
i
suppose
you
realize
that
life
in
that
barrel
wo
be
very
happy
for
the
victim
it
be
damnable
merriman
agreed
succinctly
but
we
need
worry
about
that
we
in
for
oh
quite
hilliard
returned
but
just
for
that
reason
we
do
want
more
of
it
than
is
necessary
we
could
easily
bury
ourselves
hours
too
meaning
meaning
that
we
must
go
back
to
the
wharf
until
the
night
before
the
girondin
do
see
how
we
can
be
sure
of
nor
did
i
till
i
posted
my
letter
then
i
got
my
idea
it
seemed
worth
following
up
so
i
went
round
the
shipping
offices
until
i
found
a
file
of
lloyd
list
as
you
know
it
a
daily
paper
which
gives
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
all
ships
at
the
world
ports
my
notion
was
that
if
we
could
make
a
list
of
the
girondin
ferriby
arrivals
and
departures
say
during
the
last
three
months
and
if
we
found
she
ran
her
trip
regularly
we
could
forecast
when
she
would
be
next
due
follow
me
i
had
no
trouble
getting
out
my
list
but
i
found
it
a
bit
disappointing
the
trip
took
either
ten
eleven
or
twelve
days
and
for
a
long
time
i
could
discover
the
ruling
factor
then
i
found
it
was
sunday
if
you
omit
each
sunday
the
girondin
is
in
port
the
round
trip
always
takes
the
even
ten
days
i
had
the
lesque
arrival
and
departure
for
that
one
trip
when
we
were
there
so
i
was
able
to
make
out
the
complete
cycle
she
takes
two
days
in
the
lesque
to
load
three
to
run
to
hull
two
at
ferriby
to
discharge
and
three
to
return
to
france
working
from
that
and
her
last
call
here
she
should
be
due
back
early
on
friday
good
merriman
exclaimed
jolly
good
and
today
is
thursday
just
time
to
get
they
went
out
and
bought
a
auger
and
a
bradawl
a
thick
footstool
and
a
satchel
this
latter
they
packed
with
a
loaf
some
cheese
a
packet
of
figs
a
few
bottles
of
soda
water
and
a
flask
of
whisky
these
with
their
caps
rubber
shoes
electric
torches
and
the
black
cloth
they
carried
to
their
boat
then
returning
to
the
hotel
they
spent
the
time
resting
there
until
eleven
solemnly
they
drew
lots
for
the
first
watch
recognizing
that
the
matter
was
by
no
means
a
joke
as
if
unloading
were
carried
on
by
night
relief
might
be
impossible
during
the
ship
stay
but
merriman
to
whom
the
fates
were
propitious
had
no
fear
of
his
ability
to
hold
out
even
for
this
period
by
they
were
again
sculling
up
the
river
the
weather
was
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
night
before
except
that
on
this
occasion
a
faint
westerly
breeze
had
covered
the
surface
of
the
water
with
myriads
of
tiny
wavelets
which
lapped
and
gurgled
round
the
stem
of
their
boat
as
they
drove
it
gently
through
them
they
did
not
hurry
and
it
was
after
one
before
they
moored
to
the
depot
steps
all
was
dark
and
silent
above
as
carrying
their
purchases
they
mounted
to
the
wharf
and
crept
stealthily
to
the
barrel
carefully
they
raised
the
lid
and
merriman
standing
on
the
footstool
with
some
difficulty
squeezed
himself
inside
hilliard
then
lifted
the
footstool
on
to
the
rim
and
lowered
the
lid
on
to
it
afterwards
passing
in
through
the
opening
thus
left
the
satchel
of
food
and
the
auger
a
means
of
observation
now
remained
to
be
made
two
holes
they
thought
should
afford
all
the
view
necessary
one
looking
towards
the
front
of
the
wharf
and
the
other
at
right
angles
along
the
side
of
the
shed
slowly
from
the
inside
merriman
began
to
bore
he
made
a
sound
like
the
nibbling
of
a
mouse
but
worked
at
irregular
speeds
so
as
not
to
suggest
human
agency
to
anyone
who
might
be
awake
and
listening
hilliard
with
his
hand
on
the
outside
of
the
barrel
stopped
the
work
when
he
felt
the
point
of
the
auger
coming
through
and
he
himself
completed
the
hole
from
the
outside
with
his
bradawl
this
gave
an
aperture
imperceptible
on
the
rough
exterior
but
large
within
and
enabled
the
watcher
to
see
through
a
much
wider
angle
than
he
could
otherwise
have
done
hilliard
then
once
more
raised
the
lid
allowing
merriman
to
lift
the
footstool
within
where
it
was
destined
to
act
as
a
seat
for
the
observer
all
was
now
complete
and
with
a
whispered
exchange
of
good
wishes
hilliard
withdrew
having
satisfied
himself
by
a
careful
look
round
that
no
traces
had
been
left
regaining
the
boat
he
loosed
the
painter
and
pulled
gently
away
into
the
night
left
to
himself
in
the
confined
space
and
inky
blackness
of
the
cask
merriman
proceeded
to
take
stock
of
his
position
he
was
anxious
if
possible
to
sleep
not
only
to
pass
some
of
the
time
which
at
the
best
would
inevitably
be
terribly
long
but
also
that
he
might
be
the
more
wakeful
when
his
attention
should
be
required
but
his
unusual
surroundings
stimulated
his
imagination
and
he
could
not
rest
he
was
surprised
that
the
air
was
so
good
fortunately
the
hole
through
the
lid
which
received
the
down
spout
was
of
large
dimensions
so
that
even
though
he
might
not
have
plenty
of
air
he
would
be
in
no
danger
of
asphyxiation
the
night
was
very
still
listening
intently
he
could
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
the
silence
and
utter
darkness
indeed
soon
became
overpowering
and
he
took
his
watch
from
his
pocket
that
he
might
have
the
companionship
of
its
ticking
and
see
the
glimmering
hands
and
ring
of
figures
he
gave
himself
up
for
the
thousandth
time
to
the
consideration
of
the
main
problem
what
were
the
syndicate
people
doing
was
coburn
liable
to
prosecution
to
penal
servitude
was
it
possible
that
by
some
twist
of
the
legal
mind
some
misleading
circumstantial
evidence
miss
coburn
madeleine
could
be
incriminated
oh
if
he
but
knew
what
was
wrong
that
he
might
be
able
to
help
if
he
could
but
get
her
out
of
it
and
for
her
sake
coburn
if
they
were
once
safe
he
could
pass
on
his
knowledge
to
the
police
and
be
quit
of
the
whole
business
but
always
there
was
this
enveloping
cloak
of
ignorance
baffling
him
at
every
turn
he
did
not
know
what
was
wrong
and
any
step
he
attempted
might
just
precipitate
the
calamity
he
most
desired
to
avoid
suppose
he
went
and
asked
her
this
idea
had
occurred
to
him
many
times
before
and
he
had
always
rejected
it
as
impracticable
but
suppose
he
did
the
danger
was
that
she
might
be
alarmed
or
displeased
that
she
might
refuse
to
admit
there
was
anything
wrong
and
forbid
him
to
refer
to
the
matter
again
or
even
send
him
away
altogether
and
he
felt
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
risk
that
no
he
must
know
where
he
stood
first
he
must
understand
his
position
so
as
not
to
bungle
the
thing
hilliard
was
right
they
must
find
out
what
the
syndicate
was
doing
there
was
no
other
way
so
the
hours
dragged
slowly
away
but
at
last
after
interminable
ages
had
gone
by
merriman
noticed
two
faint
spots
of
light
showing
at
his
eyeholes
seating
himself
on
his
footstool
he
bent
forward
and
put
his
eye
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
it
was
still
the
cold
dead
light
of
early
dawn
before
the
sun
had
come
to
awaken
color
and
sharpen
detail
but
the
main
outlines
of
objects
were
already
clear
as
merriman
peered
out
he
saw
with
relief
that
no
mistake
had
been
made
as
to
his
outlooks
from
one
hole
or
the
other
he
could
see
the
entire
area
of
the
wharf
it
was
about
five
and
he
congratulated
himself
that
what
he
hoped
was
the
most
irksome
part
of
his
vigil
was
over
soon
the
place
would
awaken
to
life
and
the
time
would
then
pass
more
quickly
in
observation
of
what
took
place
but
the
three
hours
that
elapsed
before
anything
happened
seemed
even
longer
than
those
before
dawn
then
just
as
his
watch
showed
eight
he
heard
a
key
grind
in
a
lock
a
door
opened
and
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
shed
on
the
wharf
he
was
a
young
fellow
slight
in
build
with
an
extremely
alert
and
intelligent
face
but
a
rather
unpleasant
expression
the
sallowness
of
his
complexion
was
emphasized
by
his
almost
jet
black
hair
and
dark
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
a
loose
gray
norfolk
jacket
and
knickerbockers
but
wore
no
hat
he
moved
forward
three
or
four
feet
and
stood
staring
downstream
towards
hull
i
see
her
tom
he
called
out
suddenly
to
someone
in
the
shed
behind
she
just
coming
round
the
there
was
another
step
and
a
second
man
appeared
he
was
older
and
looked
like
a
foreman
his
face
was
a
contrast
to
that
of
the
other
in
it
the
expression
was
good
kindly
reliable
honest
but
ability
was
not
marked
he
looked
a
decent
plodding
stupid
man
he
also
stared
eastward
ay
he
said
slowly
she
two
hours
the
first
agreed
did
expect
her
till
between
ten
and
the
other
murmured
something
about
getting
things
ready
and
disappeared
back
into
the
shed
presently
came
the
sounds
of
doors
being
opened
and
some
more
empty
decauville
trucks
were
pushed
out
on
to
the
wharf
at
intervals
both
men
reappeared
and
looked
evidently
watching
the
approach
of
the
ship
some
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
an
increase
of
movement
seemed
to
announce
her
arrival
the
manager
walked
once
more
down
the
wharf
followed
by
the
foreman
and
four
other
men
apparently
the
whole
staff
among
whom
was
the
fellow
whom
the
friends
had
tried
to
pump
on
their
first
visit
to
the
locality
then
came
a
long
delay
during
which
merriman
could
catch
the
sound
of
a
ship
telegraph
and
the
churning
of
the
screw
and
at
last
the
bow
of
the
girondin
appeared
slowly
coming
in
ropes
were
flung
caught
slipped
over
bollards
drawn
taut
made
fast
and
she
was
berthed
captain
beamish
was
on
the
bridge
and
as
soon
as
he
could
the
manager
jumped
aboard
and
ran
up
the
steps
and
joined
him
there
in
a
few
seconds
both
men
disappeared
into
the
captain
cabin
the
foreman
and
his
men
followed
on
board
and
began
in
a
leisurely
way
to
get
the
hatches
open
but
for
at
least
an
hour
no
real
activity
was
displayed
then
work
began
in
earnest
the
clearing
of
the
hatches
was
completed
the
ship
winches
were
started
and
the
unloading
of
the
props
began
this
was
simply
a
reversal
of
the
procedure
they
had
observed
at
the
clearing
the
props
were
swung
out
in
bundles
by
the
girondin
crew
lowered
on
to
the
decauville
trucks
and
pushed
by
the
depot
men
back
through
the
shed
the
empty
trucks
being
returned
by
another
road
and
brought
by
means
of
the
to
the
starting
point
the
young
manager
watched
the
operations
and
took
a
tally
of
the
props
merriman
kept
a
close
eye
on
the
proceedings
and
felt
certain
he
was
witnessing
everything
that
was
taking
place
every
truckload
of
props
passed
within
ten
feet
of
his
hiding
place
and
he
was
satisfied
that
if
anything
other
than
props
were
put
ashore
he
would
infallibly
see
it
but
the
close
watching
was
a
considerable
strain
and
he
soon
began
to
grow
tired
he
had
some
bread
and
fruit
and
a
whisky
and
soda
and
though
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
a
smoke
he
felt
greatly
refreshed
the
work
kept
on
without
intermission
until
one
when
the
men
knocked
off
for
dinner
at
two
they
began
again
and
worked
steadily
all
through
the
afternoon
until
past
seven
during
all
that
time
only
two
incidents
both
trifling
occurred
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
proceedings
early
in
the
forenoon
bulla
appeared
and
under
his
instructions
the
end
of
the
flexible
hose
from
the
crude
oil
tank
was
carried
aboard
and
connected
by
a
union
to
a
pipe
on
the
lower
deck
a
wheel
valve
at
the
tank
was
turned
and
merriman
could
see
the
hose
move
and
stiffen
as
the
oil
began
to
flow
through
it
an
hour
later
the
valve
was
turned
off
the
hose
relaxed
the
union
was
uncoupled
and
the
hose
dripping
black
oil
was
carried
back
and
left
in
its
former
place
on
the
wharf
the
second
incident
was
that
about
three
captain
beamish
and
bulla
left
the
ship
together
and
went
out
through
the
shed
merriman
was
now
horribly
tired
and
his
head
ached
intolerably
from
the
strain
and
the
air
of
the
barrel
which
had
by
this
time
become
very
impure
but
he
reflected
that
now
when
the
men
had
left
was
the
opportunity
of
the
conspirators
the
time
for
which
he
had
waited
was
approaching
and
he
nerved
himself
to
resist
the
drowsiness
which
was
stealing
over
him
and
which
threatened
the
success
of
his
vigil
but
hour
after
hour
slowly
dragged
past
and
nothing
happened
except
for
the
occasional
movement
of
one
of
the
crew
on
the
ship
the
whole
place
seemed
deserted
it
was
not
till
well
after
ten
when
dusk
had
fallen
that
he
suddenly
heard
voices
at
first
he
could
not
distinguish
the
words
but
the
tone
was
bulla
and
from
the
sounds
it
was
clear
the
engineer
and
some
others
were
approaching
then
beamish
spoke
you
better
keep
your
eyes
open
anyway
he
said
morton
says
they
only
stayed
at
work
about
a
week
they
off
somewhere
now
morton
could
discover
where
but
he
trying
to
trace
i
not
afraid
of
them
returned
the
manager
voice
even
if
they
found
this
place
which
of
course
they
might
they
could
find
out
anything
else
we
got
too
good
a
well
do
make
the
mistake
of
underestimating
their
brains
counseled
beamish
as
the
three
men
moved
slowly
down
the
wharf
merriman
considerably
thrilled
watched
them
go
on
board
and
disappear
into
the
captain
cabin
so
it
was
clear
then
that
he
and
hilliard
were
seriously
suspected
by
the
syndicate
and
were
being
traced
by
their
spy
what
luck
would
the
spy
have
and
if
he
succeeded
in
his
endeavor
what
would
be
their
fortune
merriman
was
no
coward
but
he
shivered
slightly
as
he
went
over
in
his
mind
the
steps
of
their
present
quest
and
realized
how
far
they
had
failed
to
cover
their
traces
how
at
stage
after
stage
they
had
given
themselves
away
to
anyone
who
cared
to
make
a
few
inquiries
what
fools
he
thought
they
were
not
to
have
disguised
themselves
simple
disguises
would
have
been
quite
enough
no
doubt
they
would
not
have
deceived
personal
friends
but
they
would
have
made
all
the
difference
to
a
stranger
endeavoring
to
trace
them
from
descriptions
and
those
confounded
photographs
then
they
should
not
have
travelled
together
to
hull
still
less
have
gone
to
the
same
hotel
it
was
true
they
had
had
the
sense
to
register
under
false
names
but
that
would
be
but
a
slight
hindrance
to
a
skillful
investigator
but
their
crowning
folly
in
merriman
view
was
the
hiring
of
the
boat
and
the
starting
off
at
night
from
the
docks
and
arriving
back
there
in
the
morning
what
they
should
have
done
he
now
thought
bitterly
was
to
have
taken
a
boat
at
grimsby
or
some
other
distant
town
and
kept
it
continuously
letting
no
one
know
when
they
set
out
on
or
returned
from
their
excursions
but
there
was
no
use
in
crying
over
spilt
milk
merriman
repeated
to
himself
the
adage
though
he
did
not
find
it
at
all
comforting
then
his
thoughts
passed
on
to
the
immediate
present
and
he
wondered
whether
he
should
not
try
to
get
out
of
the
barrel
and
emulate
hilliard
exploit
in
boarding
the
girondin
and
listening
to
the
conversation
in
the
captain
cabin
but
he
soon
decided
he
must
keep
to
the
arranged
plan
and
make
sure
nothing
was
put
ashore
from
the
ship
under
cover
of
darkness
once
again
ensued
a
period
of
waiting
during
which
the
time
dragged
terribly
heavily
everything
without
was
perfectly
still
until
at
about
half
past
eleven
the
door
of
the
captain
cabin
opened
and
its
three
occupants
came
out
into
the
night
the
starboard
deck
light
was
on
and
by
its
light
merriman
could
see
the
manager
take
his
leave
cross
the
gangway
pass
up
the
wharf
and
enter
the
shed
bulla
went
down
towards
his
cabin
door
and
beamish
snapping
off
the
deck
light
returned
to
his
in
about
fifteen
minutes
his
light
also
went
out
and
complete
darkness
and
silence
reigned
some
two
hours
later
merriman
who
had
kept
awake
and
on
guard
only
by
the
most
determined
effort
heard
a
gentle
tap
on
the
barrel
and
a
faint
hist
the
lid
was
slowly
raised
and
to
his
intense
relief
he
was
able
to
stand
upright
and
greet
hilliard
crouching
without
any
news
queried
the
latter
in
the
faintest
of
whispers
absolutely
none
not
a
single
thing
came
out
of
that
boat
but
props
i
had
a
splendid
view
all
the
time
except
this
hilliard
merriman
whisper
became
more
intense
they
suspect
us
and
are
trying
to
trace
let
them
try
breathed
hilliard
here
take
this
he
handed
over
the
satchel
of
fresh
food
and
took
out
the
old
one
then
merriman
climbed
out
held
up
the
lid
until
hilliard
had
taken
his
place
wished
his
friend
good
luck
and
passing
like
a
shadow
along
the
wharf
noiselessly
descended
the
steps
and
reached
the
boat
a
few
seconds
later
he
had
drifted
out
of
sight
of
the
depot
and
was
pulling
with
long
easy
strokes
the
air
and
freedom
felt
incredibly
good
after
his
long
confinement
and
it
was
a
delight
to
stretch
his
muscles
at
the
oars
so
hard
did
he
row
that
it
was
barely
three
when
he
reached
the
boat
slip
in
hull
there
he
tied
up
the
skiff
and
walked
to
the
hotel
before
four
he
was
sound
asleep
in
his
room
that
evening
about
seven
as
he
strolled
along
the
waterfront
waiting
until
it
should
be
time
to
take
out
his
boat
he
was
delighted
to
observe
the
girondin
pass
out
to
sea
he
had
dreaded
having
to
take
another
hours
trick
in
the
cask
which
would
have
been
necessary
had
the
ship
not
left
that
evening
now
all
that
was
needed
was
a
little
care
to
get
hilliard
out
and
the
immediate
job
would
be
done
he
took
out
the
boat
about
eleven
and
duly
reached
the
wharf
all
was
in
darkness
and
he
crept
to
the
barrel
and
softly
raised
the
lid
hilliard
was
exhausted
from
the
long
strain
but
with
his
friend
help
he
succeeded
in
clambering
out
having
first
examined
the
floor
of
the
barrel
to
see
that
nothing
had
been
overlooked
as
well
as
plugging
the
two
holes
with
corks
they
regained
the
boat
in
silence
and
it
was
not
until
they
were
some
distance
from
the
wharf
that
either
spoke
my
goodness
merriman
hilliard
said
at
last
but
that
was
an
awful
experience
you
left
the
air
in
that
cursed
barrel
bad
and
it
got
steadily
worse
until
i
thought
i
should
have
died
or
had
to
lift
the
lid
and
give
the
show
away
it
was
just
everything
i
could
do
to
keep
going
till
the
ship
but
did
you
see
anything
merriman
demanded
eagerly
see
anything
not
a
blessed
thing
we
are
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
merriman
i
stake
my
life
nothing
came
out
of
that
boat
but
props
no
what
those
people
are
up
to
i
do
know
but
there
one
thing
a
dead
cert
and
that
is
that
they
not
they
rowed
on
in
silence
hilliard
almost
sick
with
weariness
and
disappointment
merriman
lost
in
thought
over
their
problem
it
was
still
early
when
they
reached
their
hotel
and
they
followed
plan
of
the
morning
before
and
went
straight
to
bed
next
day
they
spent
in
the
hotel
lounge
gloomily
smoking
and
at
intervals
discussing
the
affair
they
had
admitted
themselves
outwitted
up
to
the
present
at
all
events
and
neither
could
suggest
any
further
step
there
seemed
to
be
no
line
of
investigation
left
which
might
bear
better
fruit
they
agreed
that
the
brandy
smuggling
theory
must
be
abandoned
and
they
had
nothing
to
take
its
place
we
fairly
up
against
it
as
far
as
i
can
see
hilliard
admitted
despondently
it
a
nasty
knock
having
to
give
up
the
only
theory
we
were
able
to
think
of
but
it
a
hanged
sight
worse
not
knowing
how
we
are
going
to
carry
on
the
that
is
true
merriman
returned
madeleine
coburn
face
rising
before
his
imagination
but
we
ca
give
it
up
for
all
that
we
must
go
on
until
we
find
that
all
very
well
what
are
we
to
go
on
doing
silence
reigned
for
several
minutes
and
then
hilliard
spoke
again
i
afraid
it
means
scotland
yard
after
merriman
sat
up
quickly
not
that
not
that
he
protested
as
he
had
protested
in
similar
terms
on
a
previous
occasion
when
the
same
suggestion
had
been
made
we
must
keep
away
from
the
police
at
all
he
spoke
earnestly
i
know
your
views
hilliard
answered
and
agree
with
them
but
if
neither
of
us
can
suggest
an
alternative
what
else
remains
this
was
what
merriman
had
feared
and
he
determined
to
play
the
one
poor
trump
in
his
hand
the
number
plates
he
suggested
as
i
said
before
that
is
the
only
point
at
which
we
have
actually
come
up
against
this
mystery
why
not
let
us
start
in
on
it
if
we
knew
why
those
plates
were
changed
the
chances
are
we
should
know
enough
to
clear
up
the
whole
hilliard
who
was
suffering
from
the
reaction
of
his
night
of
stress
took
a
depressed
view
and
did
not
welcome
the
suggestion
he
seemed
to
have
lost
heart
in
the
inquiry
and
again
urged
dropping
it
and
passing
on
their
knowledge
to
scotland
yard
but
this
course
merriman
strenuously
opposed
pressing
his
view
that
the
key
to
the
mystery
was
to
be
found
in
the
changing
of
the
lorry
numbers
finally
they
decided
to
leave
the
question
over
until
the
following
day
and
to
banish
the
affair
from
their
minds
for
that
evening
by
a
visit
to
a
music
hall
chapter
the
second
cargo
merriman
was
awakened
in
the
early
hours
of
the
following
morning
by
a
push
on
the
shoulder
and
opening
his
eyes
he
was
amazed
to
see
hilliard
dressed
only
in
his
pajamas
leaning
over
him
on
his
face
was
an
expression
of
excitement
and
delight
which
made
him
a
totally
different
man
from
the
gloomy
pessimist
of
the
previous
day
merriman
old
man
he
cried
though
in
repressed
tones
it
was
only
a
little
after
five
i
frightfully
sorry
to
stir
you
up
but
i
just
could
help
it
i
say
you
and
i
are
a
nice
pair
of
idiots
merriman
grunted
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
murmured
sleepily
talking
about
hilliard
returned
eagerly
why
this
affair
of
course
i
see
it
now
but
what
i
do
see
is
how
we
missed
it
before
the
idea
struck
me
like
a
flash
just
while
you
wink
i
saw
the
whole
thing
merriman
now
thoroughly
aroused
moved
with
some
annoyance
for
heaven
sake
explain
yourself
he
demanded
what
whole
thing
how
they
do
it
we
thought
it
was
brandy
smuggling
but
we
could
see
how
it
was
done
well
i
see
now
it
brandy
smuggling
right
enough
and
we
get
them
this
time
we
get
them
merriman
we
get
them
hilliard
was
bubbling
over
with
excitement
he
could
not
remain
still
but
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
his
emotion
was
infectious
and
merriman
began
to
feel
his
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
listened
hilliard
went
on
we
thought
there
might
be
brandy
in
fact
we
could
suggest
anything
else
but
we
did
see
any
brandy
we
saw
is
that
right
well
merriman
returned
impatiently
get
on
what
next
that
all
hilliard
declared
with
a
delighted
laugh
that
the
whole
thing
do
you
see
it
now
merriman
felt
his
anger
rising
confound
it
all
hilliard
he
protested
if
you
have
anything
better
to
do
than
coming
round
wakening
oh
do
get
on
your
hind
legs
hilliard
interrupted
with
another
ecstatic
chuckle
what
i
say
is
look
here
it
perfectly
simple
we
thought
brandy
would
be
unloaded
and
what
more
we
both
sat
in
that
cursed
barrel
and
watched
it
being
done
but
all
we
saw
coming
ashore
was
merriman
now
do
you
see
merriman
suddenly
gasped
lord
he
cried
breathlessly
it
was
in
the
props
of
course
it
was
in
the
props
hilliard
repeated
triumphantly
hollow
props
a
few
hollow
ones
full
of
brandy
to
unload
in
their
shed
many
genuine
ones
to
sell
what
do
you
think
of
that
merriman
got
them
at
last
eh
merriman
lay
still
as
he
tried
to
realize
what
this
idea
involved
hilliard
moving
jerkily
about
the
room
as
if
he
were
a
puppet
controlled
by
wires
went
on
speaking
i
thought
it
out
in
bed
before
i
came
along
all
they
have
to
do
would
be
to
cut
the
props
in
half
and
bore
them
out
attaching
a
screwed
ring
to
one
half
and
a
screwed
socket
to
the
other
so
that
they
screw
together
like
an
ordinary
gas
thimble
see
merriman
nodded
then
they
get
some
steel
things
like
oxygen
gas
cylinders
to
fit
inside
they
be
designed
of
such
a
thickness
that
their
weight
would
be
right
that
their
weight
plus
the
brandy
would
be
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
wood
bored
he
paused
and
looked
at
merriman
the
latter
nodded
again
the
rest
would
be
as
easy
as
tumbling
off
a
log
at
night
coburn
and
company
would
screw
off
the
hollow
ends
fill
the
cylinders
with
brandy
screw
on
the
end
again
and
there
you
have
your
props
harmless
innocent
props
ready
for
loading
up
on
the
girondin
of
course
have
them
marked
then
when
they
being
unloaded
that
manager
would
get
the
marked
ones
put
aside
they
could
somehow
be
defective
too
long
or
too
short
or
too
thin
or
too
anything
you
like
he
would
find
some
reason
for
separating
them
out
and
then
at
night
he
would
open
the
things
and
pour
out
the
brandy
screw
them
up
again
and
there
you
are
hilliard
paused
dramatically
like
a
conjurer
who
has
just
drawn
a
rabbit
from
a
lady
vanity
bag
that
would
explain
that
ferriby
manager
sleeping
in
the
shed
merriman
put
in
so
it
would
i
had
thought
of
and
merriman
went
on
there
be
enough
genuine
props
carried
on
each
trip
to
justify
the
of
course
a
very
few
faked
ones
would
do
all
they
wanted
say
two
or
three
per
cent
my
goodness
merriman
it
a
clever
scheme
they
deserve
to
win
but
they
not
going
again
he
laughed
delightedly
merriman
was
thinking
deeply
he
had
recovered
his
composure
and
had
begun
to
weigh
the
idea
critically
they
might
empty
the
brandy
themselves
at
all
he
said
slowly
what
to
prevent
them
running
the
faked
props
to
the
firm
who
plants
the
brandy
that
true
hilliard
returned
that
another
idea
my
eyes
what
possibilities
the
notion
has
they
talked
on
for
some
moments
then
hilliard
whose
first
excitement
was
beginning
to
wane
went
back
to
his
room
for
some
clothes
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
full
of
another
side
of
the
idea
let
just
work
out
he
suggested
how
much
you
could
put
into
a
prop
take
a
prop
say
nine
inches
in
diameter
and
nine
feet
long
now
you
ca
weaken
it
enough
to
risk
its
breaking
if
it
accidentally
falls
suppose
you
bored
a
hole
down
its
center
that
would
leave
the
sides
one
and
half
inches
thick
which
should
be
ample
what
do
you
think
take
it
at
that
anyway
answered
merriman
very
well
now
how
long
would
it
be
if
we
bore
too
deep
a
hole
we
may
split
the
prop
what
about
two
feet
six
inches
into
each
end
say
a
tube
take
it
at
that
merriman
repeated
how
much
brandy
could
you
put
into
a
tube
five
feet
long
he
calculated
aloud
merriman
checking
each
step
that
works
out
at
a
cubic
foot
of
brandy
six
and
a
quarter
gallons
fifty
pints
or
four
hundred
hundred
glasses
per
he
paused
looked
at
his
friend
and
resumed
a
glass
of
brandy
in
france
costs
you
sixpence
in
england
it
costs
you
therefore
if
you
can
smuggle
the
stuff
over
you
make
a
profit
of
two
shillings
a
glass
four
hundred
glasses
at
two
shillings
there
a
profit
of
pounds
per
prop
merriman
merriman
whistled
he
was
growing
more
and
more
impressed
the
longer
he
considered
the
idea
the
more
likely
it
seemed
he
listened
eagerly
as
hilliard
once
again
excitedly
pacing
the
room
resumed
his
calculations
now
you
have
a
cargo
of
about
seven
thousand
props
suppose
you
assume
one
per
cent
of
them
are
faked
that
would
be
seventy
we
do
know
how
many
they
have
of
course
but
one
out
of
every
hundred
is
surely
a
conservative
figure
seventy
props
means
pounds
profit
per
trip
and
they
have
a
trip
every
ten
days
say
thirty
trips
a
year
to
be
on
the
safe
side
pounds
a
year
profit
my
eyes
merriman
it
would
be
worth
running
some
risks
for
a
year
risks
cried
merriman
now
as
much
excited
as
his
friend
they
risk
hell
for
it
i
bet
hilliard
you
got
it
at
last
pounds
a
year
but
look
here
his
voice
changed
you
have
to
divide
it
among
the
that
true
you
have
hilliard
admitted
but
even
so
how
many
are
there
beamish
bulla
coburn
henri
the
manager
here
and
the
two
men
they
spoke
of
morton
and
archer
that
makes
seven
that
would
give
them
a
year
each
it
still
jolly
well
worth
worth
while
i
should
just
say
merriman
lay
silently
pondering
the
idea
presently
he
spoke
again
of
course
those
figures
of
yours
are
only
they
only
guesswork
hilliard
agreed
with
a
trace
of
impatience
in
his
manner
because
we
do
know
the
size
of
the
tubes
and
the
number
of
the
props
but
it
not
guesswork
that
they
can
make
a
fortune
out
of
smuggling
in
that
way
we
see
now
that
the
thing
can
be
done
and
how
it
can
be
done
that
something
gained
merriman
nodded
and
sat
up
in
bed
hand
me
my
pipe
and
baccy
out
of
that
coat
pocket
like
a
good
man
he
asked
continuing
slowly
it
be
some
job
i
fancy
proving
it
we
shall
have
to
see
first
if
the
props
are
emptied
at
that
depot
and
if
not
we
shall
have
to
find
out
where
they
sent
and
investigate
i
seem
to
see
a
pretty
long
program
opening
out
have
you
any
plans
not
a
plan
hilliard
declared
cheerfully
no
time
to
make
yet
but
we
shall
find
a
way
they
went
on
discussing
the
matter
in
more
detail
at
first
the
testing
of
hilliard
new
theory
appeared
a
simple
matter
but
the
more
they
thought
it
over
the
more
difficult
it
seemed
to
become
for
one
thing
there
would
be
the
investigations
at
the
depot
whatever
unloading
of
the
brandy
was
carried
on
there
would
probably
be
done
inside
the
shed
and
at
night
it
would
therefore
be
necessary
to
find
some
hiding
place
within
the
building
from
which
the
investigations
could
be
made
this
alone
was
an
undertaking
bristling
with
difficulties
in
the
first
place
all
the
doors
of
the
shed
were
locked
and
none
of
them
opened
without
noise
how
were
they
without
keys
to
open
the
doors
in
the
dark
silently
and
without
leaving
traces
observations
might
be
required
during
the
entire
cycle
and
that
would
mean
that
at
some
time
each
night
one
of
these
doors
would
have
to
be
opened
and
shut
to
allow
the
watcher
to
be
relieved
and
if
the
emptying
of
the
props
were
done
at
night
how
were
they
to
ensure
that
this
operation
should
not
coincide
with
the
visit
of
the
relief
and
this
was
all
presupposing
that
a
suitable
hiding
place
could
be
found
inside
the
building
in
such
a
position
that
from
it
the
operations
in
question
could
be
overlooked
here
no
doubt
were
pretty
serious
obstacles
but
even
were
they
all
successfully
overcome
it
did
not
follow
that
they
would
have
solved
the
problem
the
faked
props
might
be
loaded
up
and
forwarded
to
some
other
depot
and
if
so
this
other
depot
might
be
by
no
means
easy
to
find
further
if
it
were
found
nocturnal
observation
of
what
went
on
within
would
then
become
necessary
it
seemed
to
the
friends
that
all
they
had
done
up
to
the
present
would
be
the
merest
child
play
in
comparison
to
what
was
now
required
during
the
whole
of
that
day
and
the
next
they
brooded
over
the
problem
but
without
avail
the
more
they
thought
about
it
the
more
hopeless
it
seemed
even
hilliard
cheery
optimism
was
not
proof
against
the
wave
of
depression
which
swept
over
him
curiously
enough
it
was
to
merriman
the
plodding
rather
than
the
brilliant
that
light
first
came
they
were
seated
in
the
otherwise
empty
hotel
lounge
when
he
suddenly
stopped
smoking
sat
motionless
for
nearly
a
minute
and
then
turned
eagerly
to
his
companion
i
say
hilliard
he
exclaimed
i
wonder
if
there
might
be
another
way
out
after
all
a
scheme
for
making
them
separate
the
faked
and
the
genuine
props
do
you
know
leatham
charlie
leatham
of
ellerby
somewhere
between
selby
and
boughton
no
well
he
owns
a
group
of
mines
in
that
district
he
as
decent
a
soul
as
ever
breathed
and
is
just
rolling
in
money
now
how
would
it
do
if
we
were
to
go
to
charlie
and
tell
him
the
whole
thing
and
ask
him
to
approach
these
people
to
see
if
they
would
sell
him
a
cargo
of
props
an
entire
cargo
i
should
explain
that
he
has
a
private
wharf
for
lighters
on
one
of
those
rivers
up
beyond
goole
but
the
approach
is
too
shallow
for
a
boat
now
why
should
he
tell
these
people
about
his
wharf
saying
he
had
heard
the
girondin
was
shallow
in
the
draught
and
might
get
up
he
would
then
say
he
would
take
an
entire
cargo
on
condition
that
he
could
have
it
at
his
own
place
and
so
save
rail
carriage
from
ferriby
that
would
put
the
syndicate
in
a
hole
they
could
let
any
of
the
faked
props
out
of
their
possession
and
if
they
agreed
to
leatham
proposal
they
have
to
separate
out
the
faked
props
from
the
genuine
and
keep
the
faked
aboard
on
their
way
back
from
leatham
they
would
have
to
call
at
ferriby
to
put
these
faked
ones
ashore
and
if
we
are
not
utter
fools
we
should
surely
be
able
to
get
hold
of
them
then
what
do
you
think
hilliard
hilliard
smote
his
thigh
bravo
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
i
think
it
just
splendid
but
is
there
any
chance
your
friend
would
take
a
cargo
it
rather
a
large
order
you
know
what
would
it
run
into
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
why
should
he
he
has
to
buy
props
anyway
and
these
are
good
props
and
they
would
be
as
cheap
as
any
he
could
get
elsewhere
taking
them
at
his
own
wharf
would
be
good
business
besides
props
is
not
a
big
thing
for
a
group
of
mines
there
are
a
tremendous
lot
that
but
the
syndicate
may
not
agree
merriman
went
on
and
yet
i
think
they
will
it
would
look
suspicious
for
them
to
refuse
so
good
an
hilliard
nodded
then
a
further
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
and
he
sat
up
suddenly
but
merriman
old
man
he
exclaimed
you
forgotten
one
thing
if
they
sent
a
cargo
of
that
kind
they
send
only
genuine
props
they
would
risk
the
but
merriman
was
not
cast
down
i
dare
say
you
right
he
admitted
but
we
can
easily
prevent
that
suppose
leatham
arranges
for
a
cargo
for
some
indefinite
date
ahead
then
on
the
day
after
the
girondin
leaves
france
he
goes
to
ferriby
and
says
some
other
consignment
has
failed
him
and
could
they
let
him
have
the
next
cargo
that
would
meet
the
case
would
it
by
jove
merriman
but
you
developing
the
detective
instinct
and
no
mistake
i
think
the
scheme
worth
trying
anyway
how
can
you
get
in
touch
with
your
friend
i
phone
him
now
that
we
shall
be
over
tomorrow
to
see
leatham
was
just
leaving
his
office
when
merriman
call
reached
him
delighted
to
see
you
and
meet
your
friend
he
answered
but
you
both
come
over
now
and
stay
the
night
you
would
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
me
for
hilda
in
london
and
i
have
the
house
to
merriman
thanked
him
and
later
on
the
two
friends
took
the
train
to
ellerby
leatham
car
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
station
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
reached
the
mineowner
house
charles
leatham
was
a
man
of
about
tall
broad
and
of
muscular
build
he
had
a
strong
face
a
kindly
though
direct
manner
and
there
was
about
him
a
suggestion
of
decision
and
efficiency
which
inspired
the
confidence
of
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
this
is
very
jolly
he
greeted
them
how
are
you
old
man
glad
to
meet
you
hilliard
this
is
better
than
the
lonely
evening
i
was
they
went
into
dinner
presently
but
it
was
not
until
the
meal
was
over
and
they
were
stretched
in
basket
chairs
on
the
terrace
in
the
cool
evening
air
that
merriman
reverted
to
the
subject
which
had
brought
them
together
i
afraid
he
began
it
only
now
when
i
am
right
up
against
it
that
i
realize
what
appalling
cheek
we
show
in
coming
to
you
like
this
and
when
you
hear
what
we
have
in
our
minds
i
afraid
you
will
think
so
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
accidentally
got
hold
of
information
that
a
criminal
organization
of
some
kind
is
in
operation
for
various
reasons
our
hands
are
tied
about
going
to
the
police
so
we
trying
to
play
the
detectives
ourselves
and
now
we
up
against
a
difficulty
we
do
see
our
way
through
we
thought
if
we
could
interest
you
sufficiently
to
induce
you
to
join
us
we
might
devise
a
amazement
had
been
growing
on
leatham
face
while
merriman
was
speaking
sounds
like
the
new
arabian
nights
he
exclaimed
you
not
by
any
chance
pulling
my
leg
merriman
reassured
him
the
thing
really
a
bit
serious
he
continued
if
what
we
suspect
is
going
on
the
parties
concerned
wo
be
squeamish
about
the
means
they
adopt
to
keep
their
secret
i
imagine
they
have
a
short
way
with
leatham
expression
of
astonishment
did
not
decrease
but
by
jove
was
all
he
said
for
that
reason
we
can
only
tell
you
about
it
in
merriman
paused
and
glanced
questioningly
at
the
other
who
nodded
without
replying
it
began
when
i
was
cycling
from
bayonne
to
bordeaux
merriman
went
on
and
he
told
his
host
about
his
visit
to
the
clearing
his
voyage
of
discovery
with
hilliard
and
what
they
had
learned
in
france
their
trip
to
hull
the
ferriby
depot
and
their
adventures
thereat
ending
up
by
explaining
their
hollow
idea
and
the
difficulty
with
which
they
found
themselves
faced
leatham
heard
the
story
with
an
interest
which
could
hardly
fail
to
gratify
its
narrator
when
it
was
finished
he
expressed
his
feelings
by
giving
vent
to
a
long
and
complicated
oath
then
he
asked
how
they
thought
he
could
help
merriman
explained
the
mineowner
rather
gasped
at
first
then
he
laughed
and
slapped
his
thigh
by
the
lord
harry
he
cried
i
do
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
want
the
props
but
i
do
it
anyway
to
see
you
through
if
there
anything
at
all
in
what
you
suspect
it
make
the
sensation
of
the
he
thought
for
a
moment
then
went
on
i
shall
go
down
to
that
depot
at
ferriby
tomorrow
have
a
look
at
the
props
and
broach
the
idea
of
taking
a
cargo
it
be
interesting
to
have
a
chat
with
that
manager
fellow
and
you
may
bet
i
keep
my
eyes
open
you
two
had
better
lie
low
here
and
in
the
evening
we
have
another
talk
and
settle
what
to
be
the
next
day
the
friends
lay
low
and
evening
saw
them
once
more
on
the
terrace
with
their
host
it
seemed
that
he
had
motored
to
ferriby
about
midday
the
manager
had
been
polite
and
even
friendly
had
seemed
pleased
at
the
visit
of
so
influential
a
customer
and
had
shown
him
over
the
entire
concern
without
the
slightest
hesitation
he
had
appeared
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
disposing
of
a
whole
cargo
of
props
and
had
raised
no
objection
to
the
girondin
unloading
at
leatham
wharf
the
price
was
moderate
but
not
exceptionally
so
i
must
admit
leatham
concluded
that
everything
appeared
very
sound
and
businesslike
i
had
a
look
everywhere
in
that
shed
and
enclosure
and
i
saw
nothing
even
remotely
suspicious
the
manager
manner
too
was
normal
and
it
seems
to
me
that
either
he
a
jolly
good
actor
or
you
two
chaps
are
on
a
wild
goose
we
may
be
about
the
hollow
props
merriman
returned
and
we
may
be
about
the
brandy
smuggling
but
there
no
mistake
at
all
about
something
being
wrong
that
certain
from
what
hilliard
leatham
nodded
i
know
all
that
he
said
and
when
we
carried
out
this
present
scheme
we
shall
know
something
more
now
let
see
when
does
that
blessed
boat
next
leave
france
thursday
morning
we
reckon
hilliard
told
him
then
on
friday
afternoon
i
shall
call
up
those
people
and
pitch
my
yarn
about
my
consignment
of
props
having
gone
astray
and
ask
if
they
can
send
their
boat
direct
here
how
that
nothing
could
be
then
i
think
for
the
present
you
two
had
better
clear
out
our
connection
should
not
be
known
and
do
go
near
london
either
that
chap
morton
has
lost
you
once
but
he
not
do
it
a
second
time
go
and
tramp
the
peak
district
or
something
of
that
kind
then
you
be
wanted
back
in
hull
on
what
that
for
both
men
exclaimed
in
a
breath
that
blessed
barrel
of
yours
you
say
the
girondin
will
leave
france
on
thursday
night
that
means
she
will
be
in
the
humber
on
sunday
night
or
monday
morning
now
you
reckoned
she
would
unload
here
and
put
the
faked
props
ashore
and
load
up
oil
at
ferriby
on
her
way
out
but
she
might
she
might
go
into
ferriby
first
it
would
be
the
likely
thing
to
do
in
fact
for
then
she
get
here
with
nothing
suspicious
aboard
and
could
unload
everything
so
i
guess
you
have
to
watch
in
your
barrel
on
sunday
and
that
means
getting
into
it
on
saturday
the
two
friends
swore
and
leatham
laughed
good
heavens
hilliard
cried
it
means
about
four
more
nights
of
the
damned
thing
from
saturday
night
to
sunday
night
for
the
arrival
maybe
until
monday
night
if
she
lies
over
to
discharge
the
faked
props
on
monday
then
another
two
nights
or
maybe
three
to
cover
her
departure
i
tell
you
it
a
tall
but
think
of
the
prize
leatham
smiled
maliciously
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
see
any
other
there
is
no
other
way
merriman
declared
with
decision
we
may
just
set
our
teeth
and
go
through
with
after
further
discussion
it
was
arranged
that
the
friends
would
leave
early
next
day
for
harrogate
there
leatham
would
wire
them
on
friday
the
result
of
his
negotiations
about
the
girondin
they
could
then
return
to
hull
and
get
out
their
boat
on
saturday
should
that
be
necessary
when
about
midnight
they
turned
in
leatham
was
quite
as
keen
about
the
affair
as
his
guests
and
quite
as
anxious
that
their
joint
experiment
should
be
crowned
with
success
the
two
friends
spent
a
couple
of
lazy
days
amusing
themselves
in
harrogate
until
towards
evening
on
the
friday
merriman
was
called
to
the
telephone
that
be
leatham
he
exclaimed
come
on
hilliard
and
hear
what
he
has
to
it
was
the
mineowner
speaking
from
his
office
i
just
rung
up
our
friends
he
told
them
and
that
business
is
all
right
there
was
some
delay
about
it
at
first
for
benson
that
the
manager
was
afraid
he
had
enough
stock
of
props
for
current
orders
but
on
looking
up
his
records
he
found
he
could
manage
so
he
is
letting
the
ship
come
jolly
good
the
girondin
is
expected
about
seven
tomorrow
evening
benson
then
asked
about
a
pilot
it
seems
their
captain
is
a
certified
pilot
of
the
humber
up
to
ferriby
but
he
could
not
take
the
boat
farther
i
told
him
i
lend
him
the
man
who
acted
for
me
and
what
i
arranged
is
this
i
shall
send
angus
menzies
the
master
of
one
of
my
river
tugs
to
the
wharf
at
ferriby
about
six
on
saturday
evening
when
the
girondin
comes
up
he
can
go
aboard
and
work
her
on
here
menzies
is
a
good
man
and
i
shall
drop
a
hint
that
i
bought
the
whole
cargo
and
to
keep
his
eyes
open
that
nothing
is
put
ashore
that
i
do
get
that
be
a
still
further
the
friends
expressed
their
satisfaction
at
this
arrangement
and
it
was
decided
that
as
soon
as
the
investigation
was
over
all
three
should
meet
and
compare
results
at
leatham
house
next
evening
saw
the
two
inquirers
back
at
their
hotel
in
hull
they
had
instructed
the
owner
of
their
hired
boat
to
keep
it
in
readiness
for
them
and
about
eleven
armed
with
the
footstool
and
the
satchel
of
food
they
once
more
got
on
board
and
pulled
out
on
to
the
great
stream
merriman
not
wishing
to
spend
longer
in
the
barrel
than
was
absolutely
necessary
they
went
ashore
near
hassle
and
had
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
and
it
was
well
past
four
when
they
reached
the
depot
the
adventure
was
somewhat
more
risky
than
on
the
previous
occasion
owning
to
the
presence
of
a
tiny
arc
of
moon
but
they
carried
out
their
plans
without
mishap
merriman
taking
his
place
in
the
cask
and
hilliard
returning
to
hull
with
the
boat
if
possible
the
slow
passage
of
the
heavily
weighted
hours
until
the
following
evening
was
even
more
irksome
to
the
watcher
than
on
the
first
occasion
merriman
felt
he
would
die
of
weariness
and
boredom
long
before
anything
happened
and
it
was
only
the
thought
that
he
was
doing
it
for
madeleine
coburn
that
kept
him
from
utter
collapse
at
intervals
during
the
morning
benson
the
manager
or
one
of
the
other
men
came
out
for
a
moment
or
two
on
the
wharf
but
no
regular
work
went
on
there
during
the
interminable
hours
of
the
afternoon
no
one
appeared
at
all
the
whole
place
remaining
silent
and
deserted
and
it
was
not
until
nearly
six
that
the
sound
of
footsteps
fell
on
weary
ears
he
heard
a
gruff
voice
saying
ah
no
so
sairtain
o
it
mesel
which
seemed
to
accord
with
the
name
of
leatham
skipper
and
then
came
benson
voice
raised
in
agreement
the
two
men
passed
out
of
the
shed
and
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
pursuing
a
desultory
discussion
the
drift
of
which
merriman
could
not
catch
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
passed
when
first
benson
and
then
menzies
began
to
stare
eastwards
down
the
river
it
seemed
evident
to
merriman
that
the
girondin
was
in
sight
and
he
began
to
hope
that
something
more
interesting
would
happen
but
the
time
dragged
wearily
for
another
until
he
heard
the
bell
of
the
telegraph
and
the
wash
of
the
screw
a
moment
later
the
ship
appeared
drew
alongside
and
was
berthed
all
precisely
as
had
happened
before
as
soon
as
the
gangway
was
lowered
benson
sprang
aboard
and
running
up
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
eagerly
addressed
captain
beamish
merriman
could
not
hear
what
was
said
but
he
could
see
the
captain
shaking
his
head
and
making
little
gestures
of
disapproval
he
watched
him
go
to
the
engine
room
tube
and
speak
down
it
it
was
evidently
a
call
to
bulla
for
almost
immediately
the
engineer
appeared
and
ascended
to
the
bridge
where
all
three
joined
in
a
brief
discussion
finally
benson
came
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
shouted
something
to
menzies
who
at
once
went
on
board
and
joined
the
group
on
the
bridge
merriman
saw
benson
introduce
him
to
the
others
and
then
apparently
explain
something
to
him
menzies
nodded
as
if
satisfied
and
the
conversation
became
general
merriman
was
considerably
thrilled
by
this
new
development
he
imagined
that
benson
while
for
the
benefit
of
menzies
ostensibly
endeavoring
to
make
the
arrangements
agreed
on
had
in
reality
preceded
the
pilot
on
board
in
order
to
warn
the
captain
of
the
proposal
and
arrange
with
him
some
excuse
for
keeping
the
ship
where
she
was
for
the
night
bulla
had
been
sent
for
to
acquaint
him
with
the
situation
and
it
was
not
until
all
three
were
agreed
as
to
their
story
that
menzies
was
invited
to
join
the
conclave
to
merriman
it
certainly
looked
as
if
the
men
were
going
to
fall
into
the
trap
which
he
and
his
friends
had
prepared
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
adhered
to
his
program
and
hidden
himself
in
the
barrel
instead
of
leaving
the
watching
to
be
done
by
menzies
as
he
had
been
so
sorely
tempted
to
do
for
it
was
clear
to
him
that
if
any
secret
work
was
to
be
done
menzies
would
be
got
out
of
the
way
until
it
was
over
merriman
was
now
keenly
on
the
alert
and
he
watched
every
movement
on
the
ship
or
wharf
with
the
sharpness
of
a
lynx
bulla
presently
went
below
leaving
the
other
three
chatting
on
the
bridge
then
a
move
was
made
and
the
engineer
reappearing
all
four
entered
the
cabin
apparently
they
were
having
a
meal
for
in
about
an
hour
time
they
emerged
and
bringing
canvas
chairs
to
the
boat
deck
sat
down
and
began
to
smoke
all
except
bulla
who
once
again
disappeared
below
in
a
few
moments
he
emerged
with
one
of
the
crew
and
began
to
superintend
the
coupling
of
the
oil
hose
the
friends
had
realized
the
ship
would
have
to
put
in
for
oil
but
they
had
expected
that
an
hour
halt
would
have
sufficed
to
fill
up
but
from
the
delay
in
starting
and
the
leisurely
way
the
operation
was
being
conducted
it
looked
as
if
she
was
not
proceeding
that
night
in
about
an
hour
the
oiling
was
completed
and
bulla
followed
his
friends
to
the
captain
cabin
where
the
latter
had
retired
when
dusk
began
to
fall
an
hour
later
they
came
out
said
and
separated
benson
coming
ashore
bulla
and
menzies
entering
cabins
on
the
main
deck
and
captain
beamish
snapping
off
the
deck
light
and
his
own
room
now
or
never
thought
merriman
as
silence
and
darkness
settled
down
over
the
wharf
but
apparently
it
was
to
be
never
once
again
the
hours
crept
slowly
by
and
not
a
sign
of
activity
became
apparent
nothing
moved
on
either
ship
or
wharf
until
about
two
in
the
morning
he
saw
dimly
in
the
faint
moonlight
the
figure
of
hilliard
to
relieve
him
the
exchange
was
rapidly
effected
and
hilliard
took
up
his
watch
while
his
friend
pulled
back
into
hull
and
following
his
own
precedent
went
to
the
hotel
and
to
bed
the
following
day
merriman
took
an
early
train
to
goole
returning
immediately
this
brought
him
past
the
depot
and
he
saw
that
the
girondin
had
left
that
night
he
again
rowed
to
the
wharf
and
relieved
hilliard
they
had
agreed
that
in
spite
of
the
extreme
irksomeness
of
a
second
night
in
the
cask
it
was
essential
to
continue
their
watch
lest
the
girondin
should
make
another
call
on
her
way
to
sea
and
then
discharge
the
faked
props
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
the
next
day
passed
like
a
hideous
dream
there
being
nothing
to
watch
for
in
the
first
part
of
his
vigil
merriman
tried
to
sleep
but
without
much
success
the
hours
dragged
by
with
an
incredible
deliberation
and
during
the
next
day
there
was
but
slight
movement
on
the
wharf
to
occupy
his
attention
and
then
just
before
dark
he
had
the
further
annoyance
of
learning
that
his
misery
had
been
unnecessary
he
saw
out
in
the
river
the
girondin
passing
rapidly
seawards
their
plan
then
had
failed
he
was
too
weary
to
think
consecutively
about
it
but
that
much
at
least
was
clear
when
hilliard
arrived
some
five
hours
later
he
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
partial
coma
and
his
friend
had
considerable
trouble
in
rousing
him
to
make
the
effort
necessary
to
leave
his
hiding
place
with
the
requisite
care
and
silence
the
next
evening
the
two
friends
left
hull
by
a
late
train
and
reaching
leatham
house
after
dusk
had
fallen
were
soon
seated
in
his
with
whiskies
and
sodas
at
their
elbows
and
corona
coronas
in
their
mouths
all
three
were
somewhat
gloomy
and
their
disappointment
and
chagrin
were
very
real
leatham
was
the
first
to
put
their
thoughts
into
words
well
he
said
drawing
at
his
cigar
i
suppose
we
need
say
one
thing
and
think
another
i
take
it
our
precious
plan
has
failed
that
about
the
size
of
it
hilliard
admitted
grimly
your
man
saw
nothing
merriman
inquired
he
saw
you
the
mineowner
returned
he
a
very
dependable
chap
and
i
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
give
him
a
hint
that
we
suspected
something
serious
so
he
kept
a
good
watch
it
seems
when
the
ship
came
alongside
at
ferriby
benson
told
the
captain
not
to
make
fast
as
he
had
to
go
further
up
the
river
but
the
captain
said
he
thought
they
had
better
fill
up
with
oil
first
and
he
sent
to
consult
the
engineer
and
it
was
agreed
that
when
they
were
in
they
might
as
well
fill
up
as
it
would
save
a
call
on
the
outward
journey
besides
no
one
concerned
was
on
for
going
up
in
the
dark
there
are
sandbanks
you
know
and
the
navigation
bad
they
gave
menzies
a
starboard
deck
cabin
that
was
on
the
wharf
side
and
he
sat
watching
the
wharf
through
his
porthole
for
the
entire
night
there
was
a
thing
unloaded
and
there
was
a
movement
on
the
wharf
until
you
two
changed
your
watch
he
saw
that
and
it
fairly
thrilled
him
after
that
not
another
thing
happened
until
the
cook
brought
him
some
coffee
and
they
got
pretty
thorough
hilliard
commented
it
at
least
a
blessing
to
be
sure
beyond
a
doubt
nothing
was
we
certain
enough
of
that
leatham
went
on
and
we
certain
of
something
else
too
i
arranged
to
drop
down
on
the
wharf
when
the
discharging
was
about
finished
and
i
had
a
chat
with
the
captain
superior
chap
that
i
told
him
i
was
interested
in
his
ship
for
it
was
the
largest
i
have
ever
seen
up
at
my
wharf
and
that
i
had
been
thinking
of
getting
one
something
the
same
built
i
asked
him
if
he
would
let
me
see
over
her
and
he
was
most
civil
and
took
me
over
the
entire
boat
there
was
no
part
of
her
we
did
examine
and
prepared
to
swear
there
were
no
props
left
on
board
so
we
may
take
it
that
whatever
else
they
up
to
they
not
carrying
brandy
in
faked
nor
so
far
as
i
can
see
in
anything
else
the
three
men
smoked
in
silence
for
some
time
and
then
hilliard
spoke
i
suppose
leatham
you
ca
think
of
any
other
theory
or
suggest
anything
else
that
we
should
i
ca
suggest
what
you
should
do
returned
leatham
rising
to
his
feet
and
beginning
to
pace
the
room
but
i
know
what
i
should
do
in
your
place
i
go
down
to
scotland
yard
tell
them
what
i
know
and
then
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
hilliard
sighed
i
afraid
we
shall
have
no
option
he
said
slowly
but
i
need
say
we
should
much
rather
learn
something
more
definite
i
dare
say
but
you
have
been
able
to
either
these
fellows
are
a
deal
too
clever
for
you
or
else
you
are
on
the
wrong
track
altogether
and
that
what
i
think
i
do
believe
there
any
smuggling
going
on
there
at
all
it
some
other
game
they
on
to
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
i
do
believe
it
anything
so
crude
as
again
silence
fell
on
the
little
group
and
then
merriman
who
had
for
some
time
been
lost
in
thought
made
a
sudden
movement
lord
he
exclaimed
but
we
have
been
fools
over
this
thing
another
point
we
all
missed
which
alone
proves
it
could
have
been
faked
props
here
hilliard
this
was
your
theory
though
i
do
mean
to
saddle
you
with
more
imbecility
than
myself
but
anyway
according
to
your
theory
what
happened
to
the
props
after
they
were
unloaded
hilliard
stared
at
this
outburst
after
they
were
unloaded
he
repeated
why
returned
of
course
for
the
next
but
that
just
it
cried
merriman
that
just
what
was
done
we
seen
that
boat
unloaded
twice
and
on
neither
occasion
were
any
props
loaded
to
go
that
a
point
certainly
yes
leatham
interposed
i
suppose
they
would
have
to
be
used
again
and
again
each
trip
props
could
be
destroyed
after
arrival
and
new
ones
made
for
the
next
cargo
hilliard
shook
his
head
reluctantly
no
he
declared
impossible
those
things
would
cost
a
lot
of
money
you
see
no
cheap
scheme
say
of
shipping
bottles
into
hollowed
props
would
do
the
props
would
have
to
be
thoroughly
well
made
so
that
they
would
break
and
give
the
show
away
if
accidentally
dropped
they
would
pay
unless
they
were
used
several
times
over
i
afraid
merriman
point
is
sound
and
we
may
give
up
the
further
discussion
only
strengthened
this
opinion
and
the
three
men
had
to
admit
themselves
at
a
total
loss
as
to
their
next
move
the
only
suggestion
in
the
field
was
that
of
leatham
to
inform
scotland
yard
and
that
was
at
last
approved
by
hilliard
as
a
counsel
of
despair
there
nothing
else
for
it
that
i
can
see
he
observed
gloomily
we
done
our
best
on
our
own
and
failed
and
we
may
let
someone
else
have
a
shot
now
my
leave
nearly
up
merriman
said
nothing
at
the
time
but
next
day
when
they
had
taken
leave
of
their
host
and
were
in
train
for
king
cross
he
reopened
the
subject
i
need
say
hilliard
he
began
i
most
anxious
that
the
police
should
not
be
brought
in
and
you
know
the
reason
why
if
she
gets
into
any
difficulty
about
the
affair
you
understand
my
life
at
an
end
for
any
good
it
do
me
let
wait
a
while
and
think
over
the
thing
further
and
perhaps
we
see
daylight
before
hilliard
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
if
you
can
suggest
any
single
thing
that
we
should
do
that
we
done
i
ready
to
do
it
but
if
you
ca
i
do
see
that
we
be
justified
in
keeping
all
that
knowledge
to
ourselves
for
an
indefinite
time
while
we
waited
for
an
inspiration
is
not
that
reasonable
it
perfectly
reasonable
merriman
admitted
and
i
do
suggest
we
should
wait
indefinitely
what
i
propose
is
that
we
wait
for
a
month
give
me
another
month
hilliard
and
i
be
satisfied
i
have
an
idea
that
something
might
be
learned
from
tracing
that
lorry
number
business
and
if
you
have
to
go
back
to
work
i
slip
over
by
myself
to
bordeaux
and
see
what
i
can
do
and
if
i
fail
i
see
her
and
try
to
get
her
to
marry
me
in
spite
of
the
trouble
wait
a
month
hilliard
and
by
that
time
i
shall
know
where
i
hilliard
was
extremely
unwilling
to
agree
to
this
proposal
though
he
realized
that
he
could
not
hand
over
to
his
superiors
a
complete
case
against
the
syndicate
he
also
saw
that
considerable
kudos
was
still
possible
if
he
supplied
information
which
would
enable
their
detectives
to
establish
one
and
every
day
he
delayed
increased
the
chance
of
someone
else
finding
the
key
to
the
riddle
and
thus
robbing
him
of
his
reward
merriman
realized
the
position
and
he
therefore
fully
appreciated
the
sacrifice
hilliard
was
risking
when
after
a
long
discussion
that
young
man
gave
his
consent
two
days
later
hilliard
was
back
at
his
office
while
merriman
after
an
argument
with
his
partner
not
far
removed
from
a
complete
break
was
on
his
way
once
more
to
the
south
of
france
chapter
merriman
becomes
desperate
the
failure
of
the
attempt
to
learn
the
secret
of
the
syndicate
affected
merriman
more
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
his
interest
in
the
affair
was
not
that
of
hilliard
neither
the
intellectual
joy
of
solving
a
difficult
problem
for
its
own
sake
nor
the
kudos
which
such
a
solution
might
bring
made
much
appeal
to
him
his
concern
was
simply
the
happiness
of
the
girl
he
loved
and
though
to
do
him
justice
he
did
not
think
overmuch
of
himself
he
recognized
that
any
barrier
raised
between
them
was
the
end
for
him
of
all
that
made
life
endurable
as
he
lay
back
with
closed
eyes
in
the
corner
seat
of
a
compartment
in
the
boat
train
from
calais
he
went
over
for
the
thousandth
time
the
details
of
the
problem
as
it
affected
himself
had
coburn
rendered
himself
liable
to
arrest
or
even
to
penal
servitude
and
did
his
daughter
know
it
the
anxious
troubled
look
which
merriman
had
on
different
occasions
surprised
on
the
girl
expressive
face
made
him
fear
both
these
possibilities
but
if
they
were
true
did
it
stop
there
was
her
disquietude
due
merely
to
knowledge
of
her
danger
or
was
she
herself
in
peril
also
merriman
wondered
could
she
have
such
knowledge
and
not
be
in
peril
herself
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
would
it
not
be
a
guilty
knowledge
could
she
not
be
convicted
as
an
accessory
if
it
were
so
he
must
act
at
once
if
he
were
to
save
her
but
how
he
writhed
under
the
terrible
feeling
of
impotence
produced
by
his
ignorance
of
the
syndicate
real
business
if
he
were
to
help
madeleine
he
must
know
what
the
conspirators
were
doing
and
he
had
failed
to
learn
he
had
failed
and
hilliard
had
failed
and
neither
they
nor
leatham
had
been
able
to
suggest
any
method
by
which
the
truth
might
be
ascertained
there
was
of
course
the
changing
of
the
number
plates
a
trained
detective
would
no
doubt
be
able
to
make
something
of
that
but
merriman
felt
that
without
even
the
assistance
of
hilliard
he
had
neither
the
desire
nor
the
ability
to
tackle
it
he
pondered
the
question
as
he
had
pondered
it
for
weeks
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
felt
himself
driven
to
the
direct
course
to
see
madeleine
put
the
problem
to
her
ask
her
to
marry
him
and
come
out
of
it
all
but
there
were
terrible
objections
to
this
plan
not
the
least
of
which
was
that
if
he
made
a
blunder
it
might
be
irrevocable
she
might
not
hear
him
at
all
she
might
be
displeased
by
his
suggestion
that
she
and
her
father
were
in
danger
from
such
a
cause
she
might
decide
not
to
leave
her
father
for
the
very
reason
that
he
was
in
danger
and
all
these
possibilities
were
of
course
in
addition
to
the
much
more
probable
one
that
she
would
simply
refuse
him
because
she
did
not
care
about
him
merriman
did
not
see
his
way
clearly
and
he
was
troubled
once
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
was
not
easily
turned
from
his
purpose
but
he
was
slow
in
making
it
up
in
this
case
where
so
much
depended
on
his
decision
he
found
his
doubt
actually
painful
mechanically
he
alighted
at
the
gare
du
nord
crossed
paris
and
took
his
place
in
the
southern
express
at
the
quai
here
he
continued
wrestling
with
his
problem
and
it
was
not
until
he
was
near
his
destination
that
he
arrived
at
a
decision
he
would
not
bother
about
further
investigations
he
would
go
out
and
see
madeleine
tell
her
everything
and
put
his
fate
into
her
hands
he
alighted
at
the
bastide
station
in
bordeaux
and
driving
across
to
the
city
put
up
at
the
gironde
hotel
there
he
slept
the
night
and
next
day
after
lunch
he
took
a
taxi
to
the
clearing
leaving
the
vehicle
on
the
main
road
he
continued
on
foot
down
the
lane
and
past
the
depot
until
he
reached
the
manager
house
the
door
was
opened
by
miss
coburn
in
person
on
seeing
her
visitor
she
stood
for
a
moment
quite
motionless
while
a
look
of
dismay
appeared
in
her
eyes
and
a
hot
flush
rose
on
her
face
and
then
faded
leaving
it
white
and
drawn
oh
she
gasped
faintly
it
you
she
still
stood
holding
the
door
as
if
overcome
by
some
benumbing
emotion
merriman
had
pulled
off
his
hat
it
is
i
miss
coburn
he
answered
gently
i
have
come
over
from
london
to
see
you
may
i
not
come
in
she
stepped
back
come
in
of
course
she
said
making
an
obvious
effort
to
infuse
cordiality
into
her
tone
come
in
he
fumbled
with
his
coat
in
the
hall
and
by
the
time
he
followed
her
into
the
she
had
recovered
her
composure
she
began
rather
breathlessly
to
talk
commonplaces
at
first
he
answered
in
the
same
strain
but
directly
he
made
a
serious
attempt
to
turn
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
his
call
she
adroitly
interrupted
him
you
have
some
tea
she
said
presently
getting
up
and
moving
towards
the
door
thanks
miss
coburn
not
any
i
wanted
really
but
i
want
some
tea
she
persisted
smiling
come
you
may
help
me
to
get
it
ready
but
you
must
have
some
to
keep
me
he
had
perforce
to
obey
and
during
the
she
effectually
prevented
any
serious
discussion
but
when
the
meal
was
over
and
they
had
once
more
settled
down
in
the
he
would
no
longer
be
denied
forgive
me
he
entreated
forgive
me
for
bothering
you
but
it
so
desperately
important
to
me
and
we
may
be
interrupted
do
hear
what
i
got
to
without
waiting
for
permission
he
plunged
into
the
subject
speaking
hoarsely
stammering
contradicting
himself
boggling
over
the
words
he
yet
made
himself
clear
he
loved
her
had
loved
her
from
that
first
day
they
had
met
he
loved
her
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
he
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
she
cried
wildly
do
go
on
do
say
it
she
made
a
despairing
gesture
i
ca
listen
i
tried
to
stop
merriman
felt
as
if
a
cold
weight
was
slowly
descending
upon
his
heart
but
i
will
speak
he
cried
hoarsely
it
my
life
that
at
stake
do
tell
me
you
ca
listen
madeleine
i
love
you
i
want
you
to
marry
me
say
you
marry
me
madeleine
say
it
he
dropped
on
his
knees
before
her
and
seized
her
hands
in
his
own
my
darling
he
whispered
fiercely
i
love
you
enough
for
us
both
say
you
marry
me
say
she
wrenched
her
hands
from
him
oh
she
cried
as
if
heartbroken
and
burst
into
an
uncontrollable
flood
of
tears
merriman
was
maddened
beyond
endurance
by
the
sight
what
a
brute
i
am
he
gasped
now
i
made
you
for
pity
sake
do
stop
it
nothing
matters
about
anything
else
if
only
you
stop
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
misery
as
he
pleaded
with
her
but
soon
he
pulled
himself
together
and
began
to
speak
more
rationally
at
least
tell
me
the
reason
he
besought
i
know
i
no
right
to
ask
but
it
matters
so
much
have
pity
and
tell
me
is
it
someone
else
she
shook
her
head
faintly
between
her
sobs
thank
goodness
for
that
anyway
tell
me
once
again
is
it
that
you
do
like
me
again
she
shook
her
head
you
do
like
me
he
exclaimed
breathlessly
you
do
madeleine
say
it
say
that
you
do
she
made
a
resolute
effort
for
you
know
i
do
but
she
began
in
a
tremulous
whisper
in
a
paroxysm
of
overwhelming
excitement
he
interrupted
her
madeleine
he
cried
wildly
again
seizing
her
hands
you
do
it
could
be
possible
that
you
that
you
love
me
this
time
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hands
slowly
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
in
them
he
read
his
answer
in
a
moment
she
was
in
his
arms
and
he
was
crushing
her
to
his
heart
for
a
breathless
space
she
lay
a
happy
little
smile
on
her
lips
and
then
the
moment
passed
oh
she
cried
struggling
to
release
herself
what
have
i
done
let
me
go
i
should
have
darling
he
breathed
triumphantly
i
never
let
you
go
as
long
as
i
live
you
love
me
what
else
matters
no
no
she
cried
again
her
tears
once
more
flowing
i
was
wrong
i
should
have
allowed
you
it
can
never
he
laughed
savagely
never
be
he
repeated
why
dear
one
it
is
i
like
to
know
the
person
or
thing
that
could
stop
it
now
it
can
never
be
she
repeated
in
a
voice
of
despair
you
understand
there
are
she
argued
he
scoffed
first
then
he
pleaded
he
demanded
to
be
told
the
nature
of
the
barrier
then
he
besought
but
all
to
no
purpose
she
would
say
no
more
than
that
it
could
never
be
and
then
suddenly
the
question
of
the
syndicate
flashed
into
his
mind
and
he
sat
almost
gasping
with
wonder
as
he
realized
that
he
had
entirely
forgotten
it
he
had
forgotten
this
mysterious
business
which
had
occupied
his
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
all
else
for
the
past
two
months
it
seemed
to
him
incredible
yet
so
it
was
there
surged
over
him
a
feeling
of
relief
so
that
once
more
he
all
but
laughed
he
turned
to
madeleine
i
know
he
cried
triumphantly
the
obstacle
and
it
just
nothing
at
all
it
this
syndicate
business
that
your
father
has
got
mixed
up
in
now
tell
me
is
that
it
the
effect
of
his
words
on
the
girl
was
instantaneous
she
started
and
then
sat
quite
still
while
the
color
slowly
drained
from
her
face
leaving
it
bleached
and
deathlike
a
look
of
fear
and
horror
grew
in
her
eyes
and
her
fingers
clasped
until
the
knuckles
showed
white
oh
she
stammered
brokenly
what
do
you
mean
by
that
merriman
tried
once
more
to
take
her
hand
dear
one
he
said
caressingly
do
let
what
i
said
distress
you
we
know
the
syndicate
is
carrying
on
something
that
well
perhaps
bear
too
close
investigation
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
it
wo
affect
our
the
girl
seemed
transfixed
with
horror
we
know
she
repeated
dully
who
are
we
why
hilliard
hilliard
and
i
we
found
out
quite
by
accident
that
there
was
something
secret
going
on
we
were
both
interested
hilliard
has
a
mania
for
puzzles
and
besides
he
thought
he
might
get
some
kudos
if
the
business
was
illegal
and
he
could
bring
it
to
light
while
i
knew
that
because
of
coburn
connection
with
it
the
matter
might
affect
yes
she
seemed
hardly
able
to
frame
the
syllable
between
her
dry
lips
merriman
was
profoundly
unhappy
he
felt
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
tell
her
anything
but
the
exact
truth
whether
she
would
consider
he
had
acted
improperly
in
spying
on
the
syndicate
he
did
not
know
but
even
at
the
risk
of
destroying
his
own
chance
of
happiness
he
could
not
deceive
her
dear
one
he
said
in
a
low
tone
do
think
any
worse
of
me
than
you
can
help
and
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
remember
that
first
day
that
i
was
here
when
you
met
me
in
the
lane
and
we
walked
to
the
mill
she
nodded
you
may
recall
that
a
lorry
had
just
arrived
and
that
i
stopped
and
stared
at
it
well
i
had
noticed
that
the
number
plate
had
been
ah
she
exclaimed
i
was
afraid
you
yes
i
saw
it
though
it
conveyed
nothing
to
me
but
i
was
interested
and
one
night
in
london
just
to
make
conversation
in
the
club
i
mentioned
what
i
had
seen
hilliard
was
present
and
he
joined
me
on
the
way
home
and
insisted
on
talking
over
the
affair
as
i
said
he
has
a
mania
for
puzzles
and
the
mystery
appealed
to
him
he
was
going
on
that
motorboat
tour
across
france
and
he
suggested
that
i
should
join
him
and
that
we
should
call
here
on
our
way
so
as
to
see
if
we
could
find
the
solution
neither
of
us
thought
then
you
understand
that
there
was
anything
wrong
he
was
merely
interested
i
did
care
about
the
mystery
but
i
confess
i
leaped
at
the
idea
of
coming
back
in
order
to
meet
you
again
and
on
the
understanding
that
there
was
to
be
nothing
in
the
nature
of
spying
i
agreed
to
his
merriman
paused
but
the
girl
whose
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
his
face
made
no
remark
and
he
continued
while
we
were
here
hilliard
who
is
very
observant
and
clever
saw
one
or
two
little
things
which
excited
his
suspicion
and
without
telling
me
he
slipped
on
board
the
girondin
and
overheard
a
conversation
between
coburn
captain
beamish
bulla
and
henri
he
learned
at
once
that
something
serious
and
illegal
was
in
progress
but
he
did
not
learn
what
it
then
there
was
spying
she
declared
accusingly
there
was
he
admitted
i
can
only
say
that
under
the
circumstances
he
thought
himself
go
on
she
ordered
shortly
we
returned
then
to
england
and
were
kept
at
our
offices
for
about
a
week
but
hilliard
felt
that
we
could
not
drop
the
matter
as
we
should
then
become
accomplices
besides
he
was
interested
he
proposed
we
should
try
to
find
out
more
about
it
this
time
i
agreed
but
i
would
ask
you
madeleine
to
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
my
motive
and
to
judge
me
by
it
he
spoke
of
reporting
what
he
had
learned
to
the
police
and
if
i
had
agreed
to
help
him
he
would
have
done
so
i
wanted
at
all
costs
to
avoid
that
because
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
trouble
i
wanted
coburn
to
be
out
of
it
first
believe
me
or
not
that
was
my
only
reason
for
i
do
believe
you
she
said
but
finish
what
you
have
to
tell
we
learned
from
lloyd
list
that
the
girondin
put
into
hull
we
went
there
and
at
ferriby
seven
miles
we
found
the
depot
where
she
discharged
the
props
you
do
know
it
she
shook
her
head
it
quite
like
this
place
just
a
wharf
and
shed
with
an
enclosure
between
the
river
and
the
railway
we
made
all
the
inquiries
and
investigations
we
could
think
of
but
we
learned
absolutely
nothing
but
that
unfortunately
is
the
worst
of
it
hilliard
is
disgusted
with
our
failure
and
appears
determined
to
tell
the
oh
cried
the
girl
with
an
impatient
gesture
why
ca
he
let
it
alone
it
not
his
merriman
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
what
he
said
at
all
events
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
promise
even
to
delay
but
he
has
promised
and
we
have
a
month
to
make
our
plans
i
came
straight
over
to
tell
you
and
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
at
once
and
come
away
with
me
to
oh
no
no
no
she
cried
putting
up
her
hand
as
if
to
shield
herself
from
the
idea
besides
what
about
my
father
i
thought
about
him
too
merriman
returned
we
will
tell
him
the
whole
thing
and
he
will
be
able
to
get
out
before
the
crash
for
some
moments
she
sat
in
silence
then
she
asked
had
hilliard
any
idea
of
what
was
being
done
he
suggested
brandy
smuggling
but
it
was
only
a
theory
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
support
brandy
smuggling
oh
if
it
only
were
merriman
stared
in
amazement
it
would
be
so
bad
as
what
i
had
feared
the
girl
added
answering
his
look
and
that
was
do
trust
me
i
do
trust
you
and
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
it
is
much
i
was
afraid
they
were
printing
and
circulating
false
merriman
was
genuinely
surprised
false
money
he
repeated
blankly
yes
english
treasury
notes
i
thought
they
were
perhaps
printing
them
over
here
and
sending
some
to
england
with
each
trip
of
the
girondin
it
was
a
remark
i
accidentally
overheard
that
made
me
think
so
but
like
you
it
was
only
a
guess
i
had
no
tell
me
merriman
begged
it
was
last
winter
when
the
evenings
closed
in
early
i
had
had
a
headache
and
i
had
gone
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
next
room
the
which
was
in
darkness
the
door
between
it
and
this
room
was
almost
but
not
quite
closed
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
i
suddenly
became
conscious
of
voices
in
here
though
i
had
heard
no
one
enter
i
was
going
to
call
out
when
a
phrase
arrested
my
attention
i
did
not
mean
to
listen
but
involuntarily
i
stayed
quiet
for
a
moment
you
understand
of
course
it
was
the
natural
thing
to
captain
beamish
was
speaking
he
was
just
finishing
a
sentence
and
i
only
caught
the
last
few
words
that
a
profit
of
six
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
he
said
pounds
loss
on
the
props
and
six
thousand
seven
hundred
netted
over
the
other
not
bad
for
one
trip
lord
merriman
exclaimed
in
amazement
no
wonder
you
stopped
i
could
understand
what
was
meant
and
while
i
sat
undecided
what
to
do
i
heard
my
father
say
trouble
planting
the
stuff
captain
beamish
answered
said
not
but
then
archer
is
archer
planting
it
in
small
lots
ten
here
twenty
there
fifty
in
place
i
do
think
he
put
out
more
than
fifty
at
any
one
time
and
he
says
he
only
learning
his
way
round
and
that
he
be
able
to
form
better
connections
to
get
rid
of
it
then
bulla
spoke
and
this
was
what
upset
me
so
much
and
made
me
think
archer
is
a
wonderful
man
he
said
with
that
horrible
fat
chuckle
of
his
would
plant
stuff
on
old
nick
himself
with
the
whole
of
the
looking
on
i
was
bewildered
and
rather
horrified
and
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
more
i
crept
away
noiselessly
and
i
did
want
to
be
found
as
it
were
listening
even
then
i
did
not
understand
that
anything
was
wrong
but
it
happened
that
the
very
next
day
i
was
walking
through
the
forest
near
the
lane
and
i
noticed
henri
changing
the
numbers
on
the
lorry
he
did
see
me
and
he
had
such
a
stealthy
surreptitious
air
that
i
could
but
see
it
was
not
a
joke
putting
two
and
two
together
i
felt
something
serious
was
going
on
and
that
night
i
asked
my
father
what
it
well
done
merriman
exclaimed
admiringly
but
it
was
no
use
he
made
little
of
it
at
first
but
when
i
pressed
him
he
said
that
against
his
will
he
had
been
forced
into
an
enterprise
which
he
hated
and
which
he
was
trying
to
get
out
of
he
said
i
must
be
patient
and
we
should
get
away
from
it
as
quickly
as
possible
but
since
then
she
added
despondently
though
i
have
returned
to
the
subject
time
after
time
he
has
always
put
me
off
saying
that
we
must
wait
a
little
and
then
you
thought
of
the
false
notes
yes
but
i
had
no
reason
to
do
so
except
that
i
could
think
of
anything
else
that
would
fit
the
words
i
had
overheard
planting
stuff
by
tens
or
twenties
or
fifties
seemed
to
there
was
a
sudden
noise
in
the
hall
and
madeleine
broke
off
to
listen
father
she
whispered
breathlessly
do
say
merriman
had
just
time
to
nod
when
the
door
opened
and
coburn
appeared
on
the
threshold
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
at
his
daughter
visitor
while
the
emotions
of
doubt
surprise
and
annoyance
seemed
to
pass
successively
through
his
mind
then
he
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
somewhat
satirical
smile
on
his
lips
ah
it
is
the
good
merriman
he
exclaimed
welcome
once
more
to
our
humble
abode
and
where
is
brother
hilliard
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
come
without
him
his
tone
jarred
on
merriman
but
he
answered
courteously
i
left
him
in
london
i
had
business
bringing
me
to
this
neighborhood
and
when
i
reached
bordeaux
i
took
the
opportunity
to
run
out
to
see
you
and
miss
the
manager
replied
suitably
and
the
conversation
became
general
as
soon
as
he
could
with
civility
merriman
rose
to
go
coburn
cried
out
in
protest
but
the
other
insisted
coburn
had
become
more
cordial
and
the
two
men
strolled
together
across
the
clearing
merriman
had
had
no
opportunity
of
further
private
conversation
with
madeleine
but
he
pressed
her
hand
and
smiled
at
her
encouragingly
on
saying
as
the
taxi
bore
him
swiftly
back
towards
bordeaux
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
girl
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
thought
definitely
about
her
as
that
she
seemed
to
fill
all
his
consciousness
he
felt
numb
and
his
whole
being
ached
for
her
as
with
a
dull
physical
pain
but
it
was
a
pain
that
was
mingled
with
exultation
for
if
she
had
refused
him
she
had
at
least
admitted
that
she
loved
him
incredible
thought
he
smiled
ecstatically
then
the
sense
of
loss
returning
once
more
gazed
gloomily
ahead
into
vacancy
as
the
evening
wore
on
his
thoughts
turned
towards
what
she
had
said
about
the
syndicate
her
forged
note
theory
had
come
to
him
as
a
complete
surprise
and
he
wondered
whether
she
really
had
hit
on
the
true
solution
of
the
mystery
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
undoubtedly
pointed
in
that
direction
planting
stuff
was
he
believed
the
technical
phrase
for
passing
forged
notes
and
the
reference
to
tens
twenties
and
fifties
tended
in
the
same
direction
also
forming
connections
to
get
rid
of
it
seemed
to
suggest
the
finding
of
agents
who
would
take
a
number
of
notes
at
a
time
to
be
passed
on
by
ones
and
twos
no
doubt
for
a
consideration
but
there
was
the
obvious
difficulty
that
the
theory
did
not
account
for
the
operations
as
a
whole
the
elaborate
mechanism
of
the
industry
was
not
needed
to
provide
a
means
of
carrying
forged
notes
from
france
to
england
they
could
be
secreted
about
the
person
of
a
traveller
crossing
by
any
of
the
ordinary
routes
hundreds
of
notes
could
be
sewn
into
the
lining
of
an
overcoat
thousands
carried
in
the
double
bottom
of
a
suitcase
of
course
so
frequent
a
traveller
would
require
a
plausible
reason
for
his
journeys
but
that
would
present
no
difficulty
to
men
like
those
composing
the
syndicate
in
any
case
by
crossing
in
rotation
by
the
dozen
or
so
routes
between
england
and
the
continent
the
continuity
of
the
travelling
could
be
largely
hidden
moreover
thought
merriman
why
print
the
notes
in
france
at
all
why
not
produce
them
in
england
and
so
save
the
need
for
importation
on
the
whole
there
seemed
but
slight
support
for
the
theory
and
several
strong
arguments
against
it
and
he
felt
that
madeleine
must
be
mistaken
just
as
he
and
hilliard
had
been
mistaken
oh
how
sick
of
the
whole
business
he
was
he
no
longer
cared
what
the
syndicate
was
doing
he
never
wanted
to
hear
of
it
again
he
wanted
madeleine
and
he
wanted
nothing
else
his
thoughts
swung
back
to
her
as
he
had
seen
her
that
afternoon
her
trim
figure
her
daintiness
her
brown
eyes
clouded
with
trouble
her
little
ears
escaping
from
the
tendrils
of
her
hair
her
tears
he
broke
out
once
more
into
a
cold
sweat
as
he
thought
of
those
tears
presently
he
began
wondering
what
his
own
next
step
should
be
and
he
soon
decided
he
must
see
her
again
and
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
the
next
afternoon
therefore
he
once
more
presented
himself
at
the
house
in
the
clearing
this
time
the
door
was
opened
by
an
elderly
servant
who
handed
him
a
note
and
informed
him
that
and
miss
coburn
had
left
home
for
some
days
bitterly
disappointed
he
turned
away
and
in
the
solitude
of
the
lane
he
opened
the
note
it
read
friday
dear
merriman
i
feel
it
is
quite
impossible
that
we
should
part
without
a
word
more
than
could
be
said
at
our
interrupted
interview
this
afternoon
so
with
deep
sorrow
i
am
writing
to
you
to
say
to
you
dear
merriman
i
have
enjoyed
our
short
friendship
and
all
my
life
i
shall
be
proud
that
you
spoke
as
you
did
but
my
dear
it
is
just
because
i
think
so
much
of
you
that
i
could
not
bring
your
life
under
the
terrible
cloud
that
hangs
over
mine
though
it
hurts
me
to
say
it
i
have
no
option
but
to
ask
you
to
accept
the
answer
i
gave
you
as
final
and
to
forget
that
we
met
i
am
leaving
home
for
some
time
and
i
beg
of
you
not
to
give
both
of
us
more
pain
by
trying
to
follow
me
oh
my
dear
i
can
not
say
how
grieved
i
am
your
sincere
friend
madeleine
merriman
was
overwhelmed
utterly
by
the
blow
mechanically
he
regained
the
taxi
where
he
lay
limply
back
gripping
the
note
and
unconscious
of
his
position
while
his
bloodless
lips
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
phrase
i
find
her
i
find
her
if
it
takes
me
all
my
life
find
her
and
i
marry
like
a
man
in
a
state
of
coma
he
returned
to
his
hotel
in
bordeaux
and
there
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
drank
himself
into
forgetfulness
chapter
an
unexpected
ally
for
several
days
merriman
sick
at
heart
and
shaken
in
body
remained
on
at
bordeaux
too
numbed
by
the
blow
which
had
fallen
on
him
to
take
any
decisive
action
he
now
understood
that
madeleine
coburn
had
refused
him
because
she
loved
him
and
he
vowed
he
would
rest
neither
day
nor
night
till
he
had
seen
her
and
obtained
a
reversal
of
her
decision
but
for
the
moment
his
energy
had
departed
and
he
spent
his
time
smoking
in
the
jardin
and
brooding
over
his
troubles
it
was
true
that
on
three
separate
occasions
he
had
called
at
the
manager
house
only
to
be
told
that
and
miss
coburn
were
still
from
home
and
neither
there
nor
from
the
foreman
at
the
works
could
he
learn
their
addresses
or
the
date
of
their
return
he
had
also
written
a
couple
of
scrappy
notes
to
hilliard
merely
saying
he
was
on
a
fresh
scent
and
to
make
no
move
in
the
matter
until
he
heard
further
of
the
syndicate
as
apart
from
madeleine
he
was
now
profoundly
wearied
and
he
wished
for
nothing
more
than
never
again
to
hear
its
name
mentioned
but
after
a
week
of
depression
and
his
natural
good
sense
reasserted
itself
and
he
began
seriously
to
consider
his
position
he
honestly
believed
that
madeleine
happiness
could
best
be
brought
about
by
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
in
other
words
by
their
marriage
he
appreciated
the
motives
which
had
caused
her
to
refuse
him
but
he
hoped
that
by
his
continued
persuasion
he
might
be
able
as
he
put
it
to
himself
to
talk
her
round
her
very
flight
from
him
for
such
he
believed
her
absence
to
be
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
herself
was
doubtful
of
her
power
to
hold
out
against
him
and
to
this
extent
he
drew
comfort
from
his
immediate
difficulty
he
concluded
before
trying
any
new
plan
to
call
once
again
at
the
clearing
in
the
hope
that
coburn
at
least
might
have
returned
the
next
afternoon
therefore
saw
him
driving
out
along
the
now
familiar
road
it
was
still
hot
with
the
heavy
enervating
heat
of
air
held
stagnant
by
the
trees
the
freshness
of
early
summer
had
gone
and
there
was
a
hint
of
approaching
autumn
in
the
darker
greenery
of
the
firs
and
the
overmaturity
of
such
shrubs
and
wild
flowers
as
could
find
along
the
edge
of
the
road
a
precarious
roothold
on
the
patches
of
ground
not
covered
by
pine
needles
merriman
gazed
unceasingly
ahead
at
the
straight
white
ribbon
of
the
road
as
he
pondered
the
problem
of
what
he
should
do
if
once
again
he
should
be
disappointed
in
his
quest
madeleine
could
not
he
thought
remain
indefinitely
away
coburn
at
all
events
would
have
to
return
to
his
work
and
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
he
could
not
obtain
from
the
father
some
indication
of
his
daughter
whereabouts
but
his
call
at
the
manager
house
was
as
fruitless
on
this
occasion
as
on
those
preceding
the
woman
from
whom
he
had
received
the
note
opened
the
door
and
repeated
her
former
statement
and
miss
coburn
were
still
from
home
merriman
turned
away
disconsolately
and
walked
slowly
back
across
the
clearing
and
down
the
lane
though
he
told
himself
he
had
expected
nothing
from
the
visit
he
was
nevertheless
bitterly
disappointed
with
its
result
and
worse
than
his
disappointment
was
his
inability
to
see
his
next
step
or
even
to
think
of
any
scheme
which
might
lead
him
to
the
object
of
his
hopes
he
trudged
on
down
the
lane
his
head
sunk
and
his
brows
knitted
only
half
conscious
of
his
surroundings
looking
up
listlessly
as
he
rounded
a
bend
he
stopped
suddenly
as
if
turned
to
stone
while
his
heart
first
stood
still
then
began
thumping
wildly
as
if
to
choke
him
a
few
yards
away
and
coming
to
meet
him
was
madeleine
she
caught
sight
of
him
at
the
same
instant
and
stopped
with
a
low
cry
while
an
expression
of
dread
came
over
her
face
so
for
an
appreciable
time
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
then
merriman
regaining
the
power
of
motion
sprang
forward
and
seized
her
hands
madeleine
madeleine
he
cried
brokenly
my
own
one
my
beloved
he
almost
sobbed
as
he
attempted
to
strain
her
to
his
heart
but
she
wrenched
herself
from
him
no
no
she
gasped
you
must
not
i
told
you
it
can
not
he
pleaded
with
her
fiercely
passionately
and
at
last
despairingly
but
he
could
not
move
her
always
she
repeated
that
it
could
not
be
at
least
tell
me
this
he
begged
at
last
would
you
marry
me
if
this
syndicate
did
not
exist
i
mean
if
coburn
was
not
mixed
up
with
it
at
first
she
would
not
answer
but
presently
overcome
by
his
persistence
she
burst
once
again
into
tears
and
admitted
that
her
fear
of
disgrace
arising
through
discovery
of
the
syndicate
activities
was
her
only
reason
for
refusal
then
said
merriman
resolutely
i
will
go
back
with
you
now
and
see
coburn
and
we
will
talk
over
what
is
to
be
at
this
her
eyes
dilated
with
terror
no
no
she
cried
again
he
would
be
in
danger
he
would
try
something
that
might
offend
the
others
and
his
life
might
not
be
safe
i
tell
you
i
do
trust
captain
beamish
and
bulla
i
do
think
they
would
stop
at
anything
to
keep
their
secret
he
is
trying
to
get
out
of
it
and
he
must
not
be
hurried
he
will
do
what
he
but
my
dearest
merriman
remonstrated
it
could
do
no
harm
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
him
that
would
commit
him
to
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
if
he
thought
my
happiness
depended
on
it
she
declared
he
would
break
with
them
at
all
costs
i
could
not
risk
it
you
must
go
away
oh
my
dear
you
must
go
go
go
she
entreated
almost
hysterically
it
will
be
best
for
us
merriman
though
beside
himself
with
suffering
felt
he
could
no
longer
disregard
her
i
shall
go
he
answered
sadly
since
you
require
it
but
i
will
never
give
you
up
not
until
one
of
us
is
dead
or
you
marry
someone
else
i
will
never
give
you
up
oh
madeleine
have
pity
and
give
me
some
hope
something
to
keep
me
alive
till
this
trouble
is
she
was
beginning
to
reply
when
she
stopped
suddenly
and
stood
listening
the
lorry
she
cried
go
go
then
pointing
wildly
in
the
direction
of
the
road
she
turned
and
fled
rapidly
back
towards
the
clearing
merriman
gazed
after
her
until
she
passed
round
a
corner
of
the
lane
and
was
lost
to
sight
among
the
trees
then
with
a
weight
of
hopeless
despair
on
his
heart
he
began
to
walk
towards
the
road
the
lorry
driven
by
henri
passed
him
at
the
next
bend
and
henri
though
he
saluted
with
a
show
of
respect
smiled
sardonically
as
he
noted
the
other
woebegone
appearance
but
merriman
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
the
driver
thought
almost
physically
sick
with
misery
and
disappointment
he
regained
his
taxi
and
was
driven
back
to
bordeaux
the
next
few
days
seemed
to
him
like
a
nightmare
of
hideous
reality
and
permanence
he
moved
as
a
man
in
a
dream
living
under
a
shadow
of
almost
tangible
weight
as
a
criminal
must
do
who
has
been
sentenced
to
early
execution
the
longing
to
see
madeleine
again
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
to
feel
her
presence
was
so
intense
as
to
be
almost
unendurable
again
and
again
he
said
to
himself
that
had
she
cared
for
another
had
she
even
told
him
that
she
could
not
care
for
him
he
would
have
taken
his
dismissal
as
irrevocable
and
gone
to
try
and
drag
out
the
remainder
of
his
life
elsewhere
as
best
he
could
but
he
was
maddened
to
think
that
the
major
difficulty
the
overwhelming
insuperable
difficulty
of
his
suit
had
been
overcome
she
loved
him
miraculous
and
incredible
though
it
might
seem
though
it
was
it
was
the
amazing
truth
and
that
being
so
it
was
beyond
bearing
that
a
mere
truckling
to
convention
should
be
allowed
to
step
in
and
snatch
away
the
ecstasy
of
happiness
that
was
within
his
grasp
and
worse
still
this
truckling
to
convention
was
to
save
him
what
he
asked
himself
did
it
matter
about
him
even
if
the
worst
happened
and
she
suffered
shame
through
her
father
was
all
he
wanted
to
be
allowed
to
share
it
with
her
and
if
narrow
stupid
fools
did
talk
what
matter
they
could
do
without
their
companionship
fits
of
wild
rage
alternated
with
periods
of
cold
and
numbing
despair
but
as
day
succeeded
day
the
desire
to
be
near
her
grew
until
it
could
no
longer
be
denied
he
dared
not
again
attempt
to
force
himself
into
her
presence
lest
she
should
be
angry
and
shatter
irrevocably
the
hope
to
which
he
still
clung
with
desperation
but
he
might
without
fear
of
disaster
be
nearer
to
her
for
a
time
he
hired
a
bicycle
and
after
dark
had
fallen
that
evening
he
rode
out
to
the
lane
and
leaving
his
machine
on
the
road
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
it
was
a
perfect
night
calm
and
silent
though
with
a
slight
touch
of
chill
in
the
air
a
crescent
moon
shone
soft
and
silvery
lighting
up
pallidly
the
open
space
gleaming
on
the
white
wood
of
the
freshly
cut
stumps
and
throwing
black
shadows
from
the
ghostly
looking
buildings
it
was
close
on
midnight
and
merriman
looked
eagerly
across
the
clearing
to
the
manager
house
he
was
not
disappointed
there
in
the
window
that
he
knew
belonged
to
her
room
shone
a
light
he
slowly
approached
keeping
on
the
fringe
of
the
clearing
and
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
some
shrubs
had
taken
root
on
the
open
ground
and
behind
a
clump
of
these
not
far
from
the
door
he
lay
down
filled
his
pipe
and
gave
himself
up
to
his
dreams
the
light
still
showed
in
the
window
but
even
as
he
looked
it
went
out
leaving
the
front
of
the
house
dark
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
unfriendly
and
forbidding
perhaps
she
look
out
before
going
to
bed
he
thought
as
he
gazed
disconsolately
at
the
blank
unsympathetic
opening
but
he
could
see
no
movement
therein
he
lost
count
of
time
as
he
lay
dreaming
of
the
girl
whose
existence
had
become
more
to
him
than
his
very
life
and
it
was
not
until
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
become
stiff
and
cramped
from
the
cold
that
he
looked
at
his
watch
nearly
two
once
more
he
glanced
sorrowfully
at
the
window
realizing
that
no
comfort
was
to
be
obtained
therefrom
and
decided
he
might
as
well
make
his
way
back
for
all
the
ease
of
mind
he
was
getting
he
turned
slowly
to
get
up
but
just
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
slight
movement
at
the
side
of
the
house
before
him
and
he
remained
motionless
gazing
intently
forward
then
spellbound
he
watched
coburn
leave
by
the
side
door
walk
quickly
to
the
shed
unlock
a
door
and
disappear
within
there
was
something
so
secretive
in
the
way
the
manager
looked
around
before
venturing
into
the
open
and
so
stealthy
about
his
whole
walk
and
bearing
that
merriman
heart
beat
more
quickly
as
he
wondered
if
he
was
now
on
the
threshold
of
some
revelation
of
the
mystery
of
that
outwardly
innocent
place
obeying
a
sudden
instinct
he
rose
from
his
in
the
bushes
and
crept
silently
across
the
sward
to
the
door
by
which
the
other
had
entered
it
was
locked
and
the
whole
place
was
dark
and
silent
were
it
not
for
what
he
had
just
seen
merriman
would
have
believed
it
deserted
but
it
was
evident
that
some
secret
and
perhaps
sinister
activity
was
in
progress
within
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
even
madeleine
in
his
anxiety
to
learn
its
nature
he
crept
silently
round
the
shed
trying
each
door
and
peering
into
each
window
but
without
result
all
remained
fast
and
in
darkness
and
though
he
listened
with
the
utmost
intentness
of
which
he
was
capable
he
could
not
catch
any
sound
his
round
of
the
building
completed
he
paused
in
doubt
should
he
retire
while
there
was
time
and
watch
for
coburn
reappearance
with
perhaps
some
of
his
accomplices
or
should
he
wait
at
the
door
and
tackle
him
on
the
matter
when
he
came
out
his
first
preference
was
for
the
latter
course
but
as
he
thought
it
over
he
felt
it
would
be
better
to
reserve
his
knowledge
and
he
turned
to
make
for
cover
but
even
as
he
did
so
he
heard
the
manager
say
in
low
harsh
tones
hands
up
now
or
i
fire
and
swinging
round
he
found
himself
gazing
into
the
bore
of
a
small
repeating
pistol
automatically
he
raised
his
arms
and
for
a
few
moments
both
men
stood
motionless
staring
perplexedly
at
one
another
then
coburn
lowered
the
pistol
and
attempted
a
laugh
a
laugh
nervous
shaky
and
without
merriment
his
lips
smiled
but
his
eyes
remained
cold
and
venomous
good
heavens
merriman
but
you
did
give
me
a
start
he
cried
making
an
evident
effort
to
be
jocular
what
in
all
the
world
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
sorry
for
my
greeting
but
one
has
to
be
careful
here
you
know
the
district
is
notorious
for
merriman
was
not
usually
very
prompt
to
meet
emergencies
he
generally
realized
when
it
was
too
late
what
he
ought
to
have
said
or
done
in
any
given
circumstances
but
on
this
occasion
a
flash
of
veritable
inspiration
revealed
a
way
by
which
he
might
at
one
and
the
same
time
account
for
his
presence
disarm
the
manager
suspicions
and
perhaps
even
gain
his
point
with
regard
to
madeleine
he
smiled
back
at
the
other
sorry
for
startling
you
coburn
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
some
days
to
discuss
a
very
delicate
matter
and
i
came
out
late
this
evening
in
the
hope
of
attracting
your
attention
after
miss
coburn
had
retired
so
that
our
chat
could
be
quite
confidential
but
in
the
darkness
i
fell
and
hurt
my
knee
and
i
spent
so
much
time
in
waiting
for
it
to
get
better
that
i
was
ashamed
to
go
to
the
house
imagine
my
delight
when
just
as
i
was
turning
to
leave
i
saw
you
coming
down
to
the
shed
and
i
followed
with
the
object
of
trying
to
attract
your
he
hardly
expected
that
coburn
would
have
accepted
his
statement
but
whatever
the
manager
believed
privately
he
gave
no
sign
of
suspicion
i
glad
your
journey
was
not
fruitless
he
answered
courteously
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
neuralgia
kept
me
from
sleeping
and
i
found
i
had
forgotten
my
bottle
of
aspirin
down
here
where
i
had
brought
it
for
the
same
purpose
this
morning
it
seemed
worth
the
trouble
of
coming
for
it
and
i
as
he
spoke
coburn
took
from
his
pocket
and
held
up
for
inspection
a
tiny
phial
half
full
of
white
tablets
it
was
now
merriman
turn
to
be
sceptical
but
he
murmured
polite
regrets
in
as
convincing
a
way
as
he
was
able
let
us
go
back
into
my
office
the
manager
continued
if
you
want
a
private
chat
you
can
have
it
he
unlocked
the
door
and
passing
in
first
lit
a
reading
lamp
on
his
desk
then
relocking
the
door
behind
his
visitor
and
unostentatiously
slipping
the
key
into
his
pocket
he
sat
down
at
the
desk
waved
merriman
to
a
chair
and
producing
a
box
of
cigars
passed
it
across
the
windows
merriman
noticed
were
covered
by
heavy
blinds
and
it
was
evident
that
no
one
could
see
into
the
room
nor
could
the
light
be
observed
from
without
the
door
behind
him
was
locked
and
in
coburn
pocket
was
the
key
as
well
as
a
revolver
while
merriman
was
unarmed
moreover
coburn
was
the
larger
and
heavier
if
not
the
stronger
man
of
the
two
it
was
true
his
words
and
manner
were
those
of
a
friend
but
the
cold
hatred
in
his
eyes
revealed
his
purpose
merriman
instantly
realized
he
was
in
very
real
personal
danger
and
it
was
borne
in
on
him
that
if
he
was
to
get
out
of
that
room
alive
it
was
to
his
own
wits
he
must
trust
but
he
was
no
coward
and
he
did
not
forget
to
limp
as
he
crossed
the
room
nor
did
his
hand
shake
as
he
stretched
it
out
to
take
a
cigar
when
he
came
within
the
radius
of
the
lamp
he
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
his
coat
was
covered
with
fragments
of
moss
and
leaves
and
he
rather
ostentatiously
brushed
these
away
partly
to
prove
to
the
other
his
calmness
and
partly
to
draw
attention
to
them
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
accepted
as
evidence
of
his
fall
fearing
lest
if
they
began
a
desultory
conversation
he
might
be
tricked
by
his
astute
opponent
into
giving
himself
away
he
left
the
latter
no
opportunity
to
make
a
remark
but
plunged
at
once
into
his
subject
i
feel
myself
coburn
he
began
not
a
little
in
your
debt
for
granting
me
this
interview
but
the
matter
on
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
is
so
delicate
and
confidential
that
i
think
you
will
agree
that
any
precautions
against
eavesdroppers
are
he
spoke
at
first
somewhat
formally
but
as
interest
in
his
subject
quickened
he
gradually
became
more
conversational
the
first
thing
i
have
to
tell
you
he
went
on
may
not
be
very
pleasant
hearing
to
you
but
it
is
a
matter
of
almost
life
and
death
importance
to
me
i
have
come
coburn
very
deeply
and
sincerely
to
love
your
coburn
frowned
slightly
but
he
did
not
seem
surprised
nor
did
he
reply
except
by
a
slight
bow
merriman
continued
that
in
itself
need
not
necessarily
be
of
interest
to
you
but
there
is
more
to
tell
and
it
is
in
this
second
point
that
the
real
importance
of
my
statement
lies
and
on
it
hinges
everything
that
i
have
to
say
to
you
madeleine
sir
has
given
me
a
definite
assurance
that
my
love
for
her
is
still
coburn
made
no
answer
save
then
by
another
slight
inclination
of
his
head
but
his
eyes
had
grown
anxious
and
troubled
not
unnaturally
merriman
resumed
i
begged
her
to
marry
me
but
she
saw
fit
to
decline
in
view
of
the
admission
she
had
just
made
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
her
refusal
was
so
vehement
i
pressed
her
for
the
reason
but
she
utterly
declined
to
give
it
then
an
idea
struck
me
and
i
asked
her
if
it
was
because
she
feared
that
your
connection
with
this
syndicate
might
lead
to
unhappiness
at
first
she
would
not
reply
nor
give
me
any
satisfaction
but
at
last
by
persistent
questioning
and
only
when
she
saw
i
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
the
business
than
she
did
herself
she
admitted
that
that
was
indeed
the
barrier
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
it
is
better
is
it
not
sir
to
be
perfectly
candid
she
is
living
in
terror
and
dread
of
your
arrest
and
she
marry
me
for
fear
that
if
it
were
to
happen
she
might
bring
disgrace
on
coburn
had
not
moved
during
this
speech
except
that
his
face
had
become
paler
and
the
look
of
cold
menace
in
his
eyes
seemed
charged
with
a
still
more
vindictive
hatred
then
he
answered
slowly
i
can
only
assume
merriman
that
your
mind
has
become
temporarily
unhinged
but
even
with
such
an
excuse
you
can
not
really
believe
that
i
am
going
to
wait
here
and
listen
to
you
making
such
merriman
bent
forward
sir
he
said
earnestly
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
and
earnestly
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
am
approaching
you
as
a
friend
i
am
myself
an
interested
party
i
have
sought
this
interview
for
madeleine
sake
for
her
sake
and
for
her
sake
only
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
discuss
with
me
the
best
way
out
of
the
coburn
rose
abruptly
the
best
way
out
of
the
difficulty
he
declared
no
longer
attempting
to
disguise
the
hatred
he
felt
is
for
you
to
take
yourself
off
and
never
to
show
your
face
here
again
i
am
amazed
at
he
took
his
automatic
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
do
you
know
that
you
are
completely
in
my
power
if
i
chose
i
could
shoot
you
like
a
dog
and
sink
your
body
in
the
river
and
no
one
would
ever
know
what
had
become
of
merriman
heart
was
beating
rapidly
he
had
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
he
had
only
to
turn
his
back
to
get
a
bullet
into
it
he
assumed
a
confidence
he
was
far
from
feeling
on
the
contrary
coburn
he
said
quietly
it
is
you
who
are
in
our
power
i
afraid
you
do
quite
appreciate
the
situation
it
is
true
you
could
shoot
me
now
but
if
you
did
nothing
could
save
you
it
would
be
the
rope
for
you
and
prison
for
your
confederates
and
what
about
your
daughter
then
i
tell
you
sir
i
not
such
a
fool
as
you
take
me
for
knowing
what
i
do
do
you
think
it
likely
i
should
put
myself
in
your
power
unless
i
knew
i
was
safe
his
assurance
was
not
without
its
effect
the
other
face
grew
paler
and
he
sat
heavily
down
in
his
chair
i
hear
what
you
have
to
say
he
said
harshly
though
without
letting
go
his
weapon
then
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
you
remember
that
first
evening
i
was
here
when
you
so
kindly
supplied
me
with
petrol
sir
you
were
correct
when
you
told
captain
beamish
and
bulla
that
i
had
noticed
the
changing
of
the
lorry
number
plate
i
coburn
started
slightly
but
he
did
not
speak
and
merriman
went
on
i
was
interested
though
the
thing
conveyed
nothing
to
me
but
some
time
later
i
mentioned
it
casually
and
hilliard
who
has
a
mania
for
puzzles
overheard
he
suggested
my
joining
him
on
his
trip
and
calling
to
see
if
we
could
solve
it
you
coburn
said
another
thing
to
your
friends
that
though
i
might
have
noticed
about
the
lorry
you
were
certain
neither
hilliard
nor
i
had
seen
anything
suspicious
at
the
clearing
there
sir
you
were
wrong
though
at
that
time
we
could
not
tell
what
was
going
on
we
knew
it
was
something
coburn
was
impressed
at
last
he
sat
motionless
staring
at
the
speaker
as
merriman
remained
silent
he
moved
go
on
he
said
hoarsely
licking
his
dry
lips
i
would
ask
you
please
to
visualize
the
situation
when
we
left
hilliard
believed
he
was
on
the
track
of
a
criminal
organization
carrying
on
illicit
operations
on
a
large
scale
he
believed
that
by
lodging
with
the
police
the
information
he
had
gained
the
of
the
organization
and
the
capture
of
its
members
would
be
assured
and
that
he
would
stand
to
gain
much
kudos
but
he
did
not
know
what
the
operations
were
and
he
hesitated
to
come
forward
lest
by
not
waiting
and
investigating
further
he
should
destroy
his
chance
of
handing
over
to
the
authorities
a
complete
case
he
was
therefore
exceedingly
keen
that
we
should
carry
on
inquiries
at
what
i
may
call
the
english
end
of
the
business
such
was
hilliard
attitude
i
trust
i
make
myself
again
coburn
nodded
without
speaking
my
position
was
different
i
had
by
that
time
come
to
care
for
madeleine
and
i
saw
the
effect
any
disclosure
must
have
on
her
i
therefore
wished
things
kept
secret
and
i
urged
hilliard
to
carry
out
his
second
idea
and
investigate
further
so
as
to
make
his
case
complete
he
made
my
assistance
a
condition
of
agreement
and
i
therefore
consented
to
help
coburn
was
now
ghastly
and
was
listening
with
breathless
earnestness
to
his
visitor
merriman
realized
what
he
had
always
suspected
that
the
man
was
weak
and
a
bit
of
a
coward
and
he
began
to
believe
his
bluff
would
carry
him
through
i
need
not
trouble
you
he
went
on
with
all
the
details
of
our
search
it
is
enough
to
say
that
we
found
out
what
we
wanted
we
went
to
hull
discovered
the
wharf
at
ferriby
made
the
acquaintance
of
benson
and
witnessed
what
went
on
there
we
know
all
about
archer
and
how
he
plants
your
stuff
and
morton
who
had
us
under
observation
and
whom
we
properly
tricked
i
do
claim
any
credit
for
it
all
that
belongs
to
hilliard
and
i
admit
we
did
not
learn
certain
small
details
of
your
scheme
but
the
main
points
are
clear
clear
enough
to
get
convictions
after
a
pause
to
let
his
words
create
their
full
effect
merriman
continued
then
arose
the
problem
that
had
bothered
us
before
hilliard
was
wild
to
go
to
the
authorities
with
his
story
on
madeleine
account
i
still
wanted
it
kept
quiet
i
need
recount
our
argument
suffice
it
to
say
that
at
last
we
compromised
hilliard
agreed
to
wait
for
a
month
for
the
sake
of
our
friendship
and
the
help
i
had
given
him
he
undertook
to
give
me
a
month
to
settle
something
about
madeleine
coburn
nearly
half
that
month
is
gone
and
i
am
not
one
step
farther
the
manager
wiped
the
drops
of
sweat
from
his
pallid
brow
quiet
confident
manner
with
its
apparent
absence
of
bluff
or
threat
had
had
its
effect
on
him
he
was
evidently
thoroughly
frightened
and
seemed
to
think
it
no
longer
worth
while
to
plead
ignorance
as
merriman
had
hoped
and
intended
he
appeared
to
conclude
that
conciliation
would
be
his
best
chance
then
no
one
but
you
two
know
so
far
he
asked
a
shifty
sly
look
passing
over
his
face
merriman
read
his
thoughts
and
bluffed
again
yes
and
no
he
answered
no
one
but
we
two
know
at
present
on
the
other
hand
we
have
naturally
taken
all
reasonable
precautions
hilliard
prepared
a
full
statement
of
the
matter
which
we
both
signed
and
this
he
sent
to
his
banker
with
a
request
that
unless
he
claimed
it
in
person
before
the
given
date
the
banker
was
to
convey
it
to
scotland
yard
if
anything
happens
to
me
here
hilliard
will
go
at
once
to
the
yard
and
if
anything
happens
to
him
our
document
will
be
sent
there
and
in
it
we
have
suggested
that
if
either
of
us
disappear
it
will
be
equivalent
to
adding
murder
to
the
other
charges
it
was
enough
coburn
sat
broken
and
completely
cowed
to
merriman
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
an
old
man
for
several
minutes
silence
reigned
and
then
at
last
the
other
spoke
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
in
a
tremulous
voice
hardly
louder
than
a
whisper
merriman
heart
leaped
to
consider
your
daughter
coburn
he
answered
promptly
all
i
want
is
to
marry
madeleine
and
for
her
sake
i
want
you
to
get
out
of
this
thing
before
the
crash
coburn
once
more
wiped
the
drops
of
sweat
from
his
forehead
good
lord
he
cried
hoarsely
ever
since
it
started
i
have
been
trying
to
get
out
of
it
i
was
forced
into
it
against
my
will
and
i
would
give
my
soul
if
i
could
do
as
you
say
and
get
free
but
i
ca
i
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
sat
motionless
leaning
on
his
desk
but
your
daughter
coburn
merriman
persisted
for
her
sake
something
must
be
coburn
shook
his
clenched
fists
in
the
air
damnation
take
you
he
cried
with
a
sudden
access
of
rage
do
you
think
i
care
about
myself
do
you
think
i
sit
here
and
listen
to
you
talking
as
you
done
if
it
was
for
her
i
tell
you
i
shoot
you
as
you
sit
if
i
did
know
from
my
own
observation
that
she
is
fond
of
you
i
swear
it
the
only
thing
that
has
saved
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
pacing
jerkily
to
and
fro
see
here
he
continued
wildly
go
away
from
here
before
i
do
it
i
ca
stand
any
more
of
you
at
present
go
now
and
come
back
on
friday
night
at
the
same
time
and
i
tell
you
of
my
decision
here
the
key
he
threw
it
down
on
the
desk
get
out
quick
before
i
do
for
you
merriman
was
for
a
moment
inclined
to
stand
his
ground
but
realizing
that
not
only
had
he
carried
his
point
as
far
as
he
could
have
expected
but
also
that
his
companion
was
in
so
excited
a
condition
as
hardly
to
be
accountable
for
his
actions
he
decided
discretion
was
the
better
part
and
merely
saying
very
well
friday
night
he
unlocked
the
door
and
took
his
leave
on
the
whole
he
was
well
pleased
with
his
interview
in
the
first
place
he
had
by
his
readiness
escaped
an
imminent
personal
danger
what
was
almost
as
important
he
had
broken
the
ice
with
coburn
about
madeleine
and
the
former
had
not
only
declared
that
he
was
aware
of
the
state
of
his
daughter
feelings
but
he
had
expressed
no
objection
to
the
proposed
match
further
an
understanding
as
to
own
position
had
been
come
to
he
had
practically
admitted
that
the
syndicate
was
a
felonious
conspiracy
and
had
stated
that
he
would
do
almost
anything
to
get
out
of
it
finally
he
had
promised
a
decision
on
the
whole
question
in
three
days
time
quite
a
triumph
merriman
thought
on
the
other
hand
he
had
given
the
manager
a
warning
of
the
danger
which
the
latter
might
communicate
to
his
with
the
result
that
all
of
them
might
escape
from
the
net
in
which
hilliard
at
any
rate
wished
to
enmesh
them
and
just
to
this
extent
he
had
become
a
in
their
crime
and
though
it
was
true
that
he
had
escaped
from
his
immediate
peril
he
had
undoubtedly
placed
himself
and
hilliard
in
very
real
danger
it
was
by
no
means
impossible
that
the
gang
would
decide
to
murder
both
of
the
men
whose
knowledge
threatened
them
in
the
hope
of
bluffing
the
bank
manager
out
of
the
letter
which
they
would
believe
he
held
merriman
had
invented
this
letter
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
he
would
have
felt
a
good
deal
happier
if
he
knew
that
it
really
existed
he
decided
that
he
would
write
to
hilliard
immediately
and
get
him
to
make
it
a
reality
a
great
deal
he
thought
depended
on
the
character
of
coburn
if
he
was
weak
and
cowardly
he
would
try
to
save
his
own
skin
and
let
the
others
walk
into
the
net
particularly
might
he
do
this
if
he
had
suffered
at
their
hands
in
the
way
he
suggested
on
the
other
hand
a
strong
man
would
undoubtedly
consult
his
and
see
that
a
pretty
determined
fight
was
made
for
their
liberty
and
their
source
of
gain
he
had
thought
of
all
this
when
it
suddenly
flashed
into
his
mind
that
coburn
presence
in
the
shed
at
two
in
the
morning
in
itself
required
a
lot
of
explanation
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
the
aspirin
story
the
man
had
looked
so
shifty
while
he
was
speaking
that
even
at
the
time
merriman
had
decided
he
was
lying
what
then
could
he
have
been
doing
he
puzzled
over
the
questions
but
without
result
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
as
he
was
doing
nothing
that
evening
he
might
as
well
ride
out
again
to
the
clearing
and
see
if
any
nocturnal
activities
were
undertaken
midnight
therefore
found
him
once
more
ensconced
behind
a
group
of
shrubs
in
full
view
of
both
the
house
and
the
shed
it
was
again
a
perfect
night
and
again
he
lay
dreaming
of
the
girl
who
was
so
near
in
body
and
in
spirit
and
yet
so
infinitely
far
beyond
his
reach
time
passed
slowly
but
the
hours
wore
gradually
round
until
his
watch
showed
two
then
just
as
he
was
thinking
that
he
need
hardly
wait
much
longer
he
was
considerably
thrilled
to
see
coburn
once
more
appear
at
the
side
door
of
the
house
and
in
the
same
stealthy
secretive
way
as
on
the
previous
night
walk
hurriedly
to
the
shed
and
let
himself
in
by
the
office
door
at
first
merriman
thought
of
following
him
again
in
the
hope
of
learning
the
nature
of
these
strange
proceedings
but
a
moment
thought
showed
him
he
must
run
no
risk
of
discovery
if
coburn
learned
that
he
was
being
spied
on
he
would
at
once
doubt
merriman
statement
that
he
knew
the
syndicate
secret
it
would
be
better
therefore
to
lie
low
and
await
events
but
the
only
other
interesting
event
that
happened
was
that
some
fifteen
minutes
later
the
manager
left
the
shed
and
with
the
same
show
of
secrecy
returned
to
his
house
disappearing
into
the
side
door
so
intrigued
was
merriman
by
the
whole
business
that
he
determined
to
repeat
his
visit
the
following
night
also
he
did
so
and
once
again
witnessed
coburn
stealthy
walk
to
the
shed
at
two
and
his
equally
stealthy
return
at
rack
his
brains
as
he
would
over
the
problem
of
these
nocturnal
visits
merriman
could
think
of
no
explanation
what
for
three
consecutive
nights
could
bring
the
manager
down
to
the
sawmill
he
could
not
imagine
but
he
was
clear
it
was
not
the
industry
if
the
girondin
had
been
in
he
would
have
once
more
suspected
smuggling
but
she
was
then
at
ferriby
no
it
certainly
did
not
work
in
with
smuggling
still
less
did
it
suggest
false
note
printing
unless
merriman
heart
beat
more
quickly
as
a
new
idea
entered
his
mind
suppose
the
notes
were
printed
there
at
the
mill
suppose
there
was
a
cellar
under
the
engine
house
and
suppose
the
work
was
done
at
night
it
was
true
they
had
not
seen
signs
of
a
cellar
but
if
this
surmise
was
correct
it
was
not
likely
they
would
at
first
sight
this
theory
seemed
a
real
advance
but
a
little
further
thought
showed
it
had
serious
objections
firstly
it
did
not
explain
coburn
nightly
visits
if
the
manager
had
spent
some
hours
in
the
works
it
might
have
indicated
the
working
of
a
press
but
what
in
that
way
could
be
done
in
fifteen
minutes
further
and
this
seemed
to
put
the
idea
quite
out
of
court
if
the
notes
were
being
produced
at
the
clearing
why
the
changing
of
the
lorry
numbers
that
would
then
be
a
part
of
the
business
quite
unconnected
with
the
illicit
traffic
after
much
thought
merriman
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
here
was
one
more
of
the
series
of
insoluble
puzzles
with
which
they
found
themselves
faced
the
next
night
was
friday
and
in
accordance
with
the
arrangement
made
with
coburn
merriman
once
again
went
out
to
the
clearing
presenting
himself
at
the
works
door
at
two
in
the
morning
coburn
at
once
opened
to
his
knock
and
after
locking
the
door
led
the
way
to
his
office
there
he
wasted
no
time
in
preliminaries
i
thought
this
over
merriman
he
said
and
his
manner
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
previous
interview
and
i
bound
to
say
that
i
realized
that
though
interested
your
action
towards
me
has
been
correct
not
to
say
generous
now
i
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
and
i
trust
you
will
see
your
way
to
fall
in
with
my
ideas
there
is
a
meeting
of
the
syndicate
on
thursday
week
i
should
have
been
present
in
any
case
and
i
have
decided
that
whatever
may
be
the
result
i
will
tell
them
i
am
going
to
break
with
them
i
will
give
as
my
reason
for
this
step
and
fortunately
or
unfortunately
i
can
do
this
with
truth
as
my
heart
is
seriously
diseased
i
can
easily
provide
the
necessary
doctor
certificates
if
they
accept
my
resignation
well
and
good
i
will
emigrate
to
my
brother
in
south
america
and
you
and
madeleine
can
be
married
if
they
decline
well
coburn
shrugged
his
shoulders
your
embarrassment
will
be
otherwise
he
paused
merriman
would
have
spoken
but
coburn
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
went
on
i
confess
i
have
been
terribly
upset
for
the
last
three
days
to
discover
my
wisest
course
and
even
now
i
am
far
from
certain
that
my
decision
is
best
i
do
not
want
to
go
back
on
my
former
friends
and
on
account
of
madeleine
i
can
not
go
back
on
you
therefore
i
can
not
warn
the
others
of
their
danger
but
on
the
other
hand
i
wo
give
your
life
into
their
hands
for
if
they
knew
what
i
know
now
you
and
hilliard
would
be
dead
men
inside
coburn
spoke
simply
and
with
a
certain
dignity
and
merriman
found
himself
disposed
not
only
to
believe
what
he
had
heard
but
even
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
the
man
in
the
embarrassing
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
that
his
difficulties
were
of
his
own
making
there
could
be
but
little
doubt
but
how
far
he
had
put
himself
in
the
power
of
his
associates
through
deliberate
and
how
far
through
mistakes
or
weakness
there
was
of
course
no
way
of
learning
at
the
end
of
an
hour
discussion
coburn
had
agreed
at
all
costs
to
sever
his
connection
with
the
syndicate
to
emigrate
to
his
brother
in
chile
and
to
do
his
utmost
to
induce
his
daughter
to
remain
in
england
to
marry
merriman
on
his
side
merriman
undertook
to
hold
back
the
lodging
of
information
at
scotland
yard
for
one
more
week
to
enable
the
other
arrangements
to
be
carried
out
there
being
nothing
to
keep
him
in
bordeaux
merriman
left
for
london
that
day
and
the
next
evening
he
was
closeted
with
hilliard
in
the
latter
rooms
discussing
the
affair
hilliard
at
first
was
most
unwilling
to
postpone
their
visit
to
the
yard
but
he
agreed
on
merriman
explaining
that
he
had
pledged
himself
to
the
delay
so
the
days
for
merriman
heavily
weighted
with
anxiety
and
suspense
began
slowly
to
drag
by
his
fate
and
the
fate
of
the
girl
he
loved
hung
in
the
balance
and
not
the
least
irksome
feature
of
his
position
was
his
own
utter
impotence
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
no
action
which
would
take
him
out
of
himself
and
ease
the
tension
of
his
thoughts
as
day
succeeded
day
and
the
silence
remained
unbroken
he
became
more
and
more
upset
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
was
almost
beside
himself
with
worry
and
chagrin
so
much
so
that
he
gave
up
attending
his
office
altogether
and
was
only
restrained
from
rushing
back
to
bordeaux
by
the
knowledge
that
to
force
himself
once
more
on
madeleine
might
be
to
destroy
once
and
for
ever
any
hopes
he
might
otherwise
have
had
it
was
now
four
days
since
the
thursday
on
which
coburn
had
stated
that
the
meeting
of
the
syndicate
was
to
have
been
held
and
only
three
days
to
the
date
on
which
the
friends
had
agreed
to
tell
their
story
at
scotland
yard
what
if
he
received
no
news
during
those
three
days
would
hilliard
agree
to
a
further
postponement
he
feared
not
and
he
was
racked
with
anxiety
as
to
whether
he
should
cross
that
day
to
france
and
seek
another
interview
with
coburn
but
even
as
he
sat
with
the
morning
paper
in
his
hand
news
was
nearer
than
he
imagined
listlessly
he
turned
over
the
sheets
glancing
with
but
scant
attention
to
the
headlines
automatically
running
his
eyes
over
the
paragraphs
and
when
he
came
to
one
headed
mystery
of
a
he
began
to
read
it
also
but
he
had
not
gone
very
far
when
his
manner
changed
starting
to
his
feet
he
stared
at
the
column
with
eyes
while
his
face
grew
pallid
and
his
pipe
dropped
to
the
floor
from
his
open
mouth
with
the
newspaper
still
tightly
grasped
in
his
hand
he
ran
three
steps
at
a
time
down
the
stairs
of
his
flat
and
calling
a
taxi
was
driven
to
scotland
yard
part
two
the
professionals
chapter
murder
almost
exactly
fifteen
hours
before
merriman
call
at
scotland
yard
to
wit
about
eight
on
the
previous
evening
inspector
willis
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
was
smoking
in
the
of
his
tiny
house
in
brixton
george
willis
was
a
tall
somewhat
burly
man
of
with
heavy
expressionless
features
which
would
have
made
his
face
almost
stupid
had
it
not
been
redeemed
by
a
pair
of
the
keenest
of
blue
eyes
he
was
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
safe
man
not
exactly
brilliant
but
plodding
and
tenacious
to
an
extraordinary
degree
his
forte
was
slight
clues
and
he
possessed
that
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
which
made
his
following
up
of
them
approximate
to
genius
in
short
though
a
trifle
slow
he
was
already
looked
on
as
one
of
the
most
efficient
and
reliable
inspectors
of
the
yard
he
had
had
a
heavy
day
and
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
he
picked
up
the
evening
paper
and
stretched
himself
luxuriously
in
his
but
he
was
not
destined
to
enjoy
a
long
rest
hardly
had
he
settled
himself
to
his
satisfaction
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
he
was
wanted
back
at
the
yard
immediately
he
swore
under
his
breath
then
calling
the
news
to
his
wife
he
slipped
on
his
waterproof
and
left
the
house
the
long
spell
of
fine
weather
had
at
last
broken
and
the
evening
was
unpleasant
indeed
unusually
inclement
for
all
day
the
wind
had
been
gusty
and
boisterous
and
now
a
fine
drizzle
of
rain
had
set
in
which
was
driven
in
sheets
against
the
grimy
buildings
and
whirled
in
eddies
round
the
street
corners
willis
walked
quickly
along
the
shining
pavements
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
his
destination
his
chief
was
waiting
for
him
ah
willis
the
great
man
greeted
him
i
glad
you
were
out
a
case
has
been
reported
which
i
want
you
to
take
over
a
suspected
murder
man
found
dead
in
a
taxi
at
king
yes
sir
willis
answered
unemotionally
any
details
forward
none
except
that
the
man
is
dead
and
that
they
holding
the
taxi
at
the
station
i
have
asked
horton
to
come
round
and
you
had
both
better
get
over
there
as
quickly
as
yes
sir
willis
replied
again
and
quickly
left
the
room
his
preparations
were
simple
he
had
only
to
arrange
for
a
couple
of
plain
clothes
men
and
a
photographer
with
a
flashlight
apparatus
to
accompany
him
and
to
bring
from
his
room
a
handbag
containing
his
notebook
and
a
few
other
necessary
articles
he
met
the
police
doctor
in
the
corridor
and
the
others
being
already
in
waiting
the
five
men
immediately
left
the
great
building
and
took
a
car
to
the
station
what
the
case
inspector
do
you
know
horton
inquired
as
they
slipped
deftly
through
the
traffic
the
chief
said
suspected
murder
man
found
dead
in
a
taxi
at
cross
he
had
no
how
was
it
done
do
know
sir
chief
did
after
a
few
brief
observations
on
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
conversation
waned
between
the
two
men
and
they
followed
the
example
of
their
companions
and
sat
watching
with
a
depressed
air
the
streets
and
the
hurrying
foot
passengers
on
the
wet
pavements
all
five
were
annoyed
at
being
called
out
as
all
were
tired
and
had
been
looking
forward
to
an
evening
of
relaxation
at
their
homes
they
made
a
quick
run
reaching
the
station
in
a
very
few
minutes
there
a
constable
identified
the
inspector
they
taken
the
taxi
round
to
the
carrier
yard
at
the
west
side
of
the
station
sir
he
said
to
willis
if
you
follow
me
i
show
you
the
the
officer
led
them
to
an
enclosed
and
partially
roofed
area
at
the
back
of
the
parcels
office
where
the
vans
from
the
shops
unloaded
their
traffic
in
a
corner
under
the
roof
and
surrounded
by
a
little
knot
of
men
stood
a
as
willis
and
his
companions
approached
a
sergeant
of
police
separated
himself
from
the
others
and
came
forward
we
have
touched
nothing
sir
he
announced
when
we
found
the
man
was
dead
we
did
even
move
the
willis
nodded
quite
right
sergeant
it
murder
i
suppose
looks
like
it
sir
the
man
was
shot
anything
known
of
the
murderer
not
much
i
afraid
sir
he
got
clear
away
in
tottenham
court
road
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it
but
you
hear
what
the
driver
has
to
again
the
inspector
nodded
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
vehicle
here
newman
the
sergeant
continued
indicating
an
exceedingly
dapper
and
little
man
with
medico
written
all
over
him
he
was
the
nearest
medical
man
we
could
willis
turned
courteously
to
the
other
an
unpleasant
evening
to
be
called
out
doctor
he
remarked
the
man
dead
i
understand
was
he
dead
when
you
arrived
yes
but
only
a
very
little
time
the
body
was
quite
and
the
cause
of
death
seeing
that
i
could
do
nothing
i
did
not
move
the
body
until
you
scotland
yard
gentlemen
had
seen
it
and
therefore
i
can
not
say
professionally
but
there
is
a
small
hole
in
the
side
of
the
coat
over
the
the
doctor
spoke
with
a
slightly
consequential
air
a
bullet
wound
a
bullet
wound
inspector
willis
picked
up
an
acetylene
bicycle
lamp
which
one
of
the
men
had
procured
and
directed
its
beam
into
the
cab
the
corpse
lay
in
the
back
corner
seat
on
the
driver
side
the
head
lolling
back
sideways
against
the
cushions
and
crushing
into
a
shapeless
mass
the
gray
homburg
hat
the
mouth
and
eyes
were
open
and
the
features
twisted
as
if
from
sudden
pain
the
face
was
long
and
oval
the
hair
and
eyes
dark
and
there
was
a
tiny
black
mustache
with
waxed
ends
a
khaki
colored
waterproof
open
in
front
revealed
a
gray
tweed
suit
across
the
waistcoat
of
which
shone
a
gold
watch
chain
tan
shoes
covered
the
feet
on
the
left
side
of
the
body
just
over
the
heart
was
a
little
round
hole
in
the
waterproof
coat
willis
stooped
and
smelled
the
cloth
no
blackening
and
no
smell
of
burned
powder
he
thought
he
must
have
been
shot
from
outside
the
but
he
found
it
hard
to
understand
how
such
a
shot
could
have
been
fired
from
the
populous
streets
of
london
the
hole
also
seemed
too
far
round
towards
the
back
of
the
body
to
suggest
that
the
bullet
had
come
in
through
the
open
window
the
point
was
puzzling
but
willis
pulled
himself
up
sharply
with
the
reminder
that
he
must
not
begin
theorizing
until
he
had
learned
all
the
facts
having
gazed
at
the
gruesome
sight
until
he
had
impressed
its
every
detail
on
his
memory
he
turned
to
his
assistant
get
ahead
with
your
flashlight
kirby
he
ordered
take
views
from
all
the
angles
you
can
the
constable
will
give
you
a
hand
meantime
sergeant
give
me
an
idea
of
the
case
what
does
the
driver
say
he
here
sir
the
officer
returned
pointing
to
a
small
slight
individual
in
a
leather
coat
and
cap
with
a
sallow
frightened
face
and
pathetic
eyes
which
fixed
themselves
questioningly
on
face
as
the
sergeant
led
their
owner
forward
you
might
tell
me
what
you
know
the
man
shifted
nervously
from
one
foot
to
the
other
it
was
this
way
sir
he
began
he
spoke
earnestly
and
to
willis
who
was
accustomed
to
sizing
up
rapidly
those
with
whom
he
dealt
he
seemed
a
sincere
and
honest
man
i
was
driving
down
piccadilly
from
hyde
park
corner
looking
out
for
a
fare
and
when
i
gets
just
by
the
end
of
bond
street
two
men
hails
me
one
was
this
here
man
what
dead
the
other
was
a
big
tall
gent
i
pulls
in
to
the
curb
and
they
gets
in
and
the
tall
gent
he
says
cross
i
starts
off
by
piccadilly
circus
and
shaftesbury
avenue
but
when
i
gets
into
tottenham
court
road
about
the
corner
of
great
russell
street
one
of
them
says
through
the
tube
me
down
here
at
the
corner
of
great
russell
street
he
sez
i
pulls
over
to
the
curb
and
the
tall
gent
he
gets
out
and
stands
on
the
curb
and
speaks
in
to
the
other
one
then
i
shall
follow
by
the
three
tomorrow
he
sez
and
he
shuts
the
door
and
gives
me
a
bob
and
sez
for
yourself
he
sez
my
friend
will
square
up
at
the
station
he
sez
i
came
on
here
and
when
this
here
man
opens
the
door
he
indicated
a
porter
standing
by
why
the
man
dead
and
that
all
i
knows
about
the
statement
was
made
directly
and
convincingly
and
willis
frowned
as
he
thought
that
such
apparently
simple
cases
proved
frequently
to
be
the
most
baffling
in
the
end
in
his
slow
careful
way
he
went
over
in
his
mind
what
he
had
heard
and
then
began
to
try
for
further
details
at
what
time
did
you
pick
up
the
men
he
inquired
about
half
past
seven
or
maybe
twenty
to
eight
did
you
see
where
they
were
coming
from
no
sir
they
were
standing
on
the
curb
and
the
tall
one
he
holds
up
his
hand
for
me
to
pull
would
you
know
the
tall
man
again
the
driver
shook
his
head
i
do
know
as
i
should
sir
you
see
it
was
raining
and
he
had
his
collar
up
round
his
neck
and
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
so
as
i
could
right
see
his
describe
him
as
best
you
he
was
a
tall
man
longer
than
what
you
are
and
broad
too
a
big
man
i
should
call
how
was
he
dressed
he
had
a
waterproof
khaki
color
about
the
color
of
your
own
with
the
collar
up
round
his
his
hat
his
hat
was
a
soft
felt
dark
either
brown
or
green
i
rightly
say
with
the
brim
turned
down
in
and
his
face
man
alive
you
must
have
seen
his
face
when
he
gave
you
the
the
driver
stared
helplessly
then
he
answered
i
could
be
sure
about
his
face
not
with
the
way
he
had
his
collar
up
and
his
hat
pulled
down
it
was
raining
and
blowing
something
did
the
other
man
reply
when
the
tall
one
spoke
into
the
cab
did
hear
no
reply
at
all
inspector
willis
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
started
on
another
tack
did
you
hear
a
shot
he
asked
sharply
i
heard
it
sir
right
enough
but
i
did
think
it
was
a
shot
at
the
time
and
i
did
think
it
was
in
my
cab
it
was
just
when
we
were
passing
the
apollo
theater
and
there
was
a
big
block
of
cars
setting
people
down
and
i
thought
it
was
a
burst
tire
somebody
tire
gone
to
glory
i
sez
to
myself
but
i
give
it
no
more
thought
for
it
takes
you
to
be
awake
to
drive
up
shaftesbury
avenue
when
the
theaters
are
you
said
you
did
think
the
shot
was
in
your
cab
why
do
you
think
so
now
it
was
the
only
sound
like
a
shot
sir
and
if
the
man
has
been
shot
it
would
have
been
willis
nodded
shortly
there
was
something
puzzling
here
if
the
shot
had
been
fired
by
the
other
occupant
of
the
cab
as
the
man
evidence
seemed
to
indicate
there
would
certainly
have
been
powder
blackening
on
the
coat
if
not
and
if
the
bullet
had
entered
from
without
the
other
passenger
would
surely
have
stopped
the
car
and
called
a
policeman
presently
he
saw
that
some
corroborative
evidence
might
exist
if
the
bullet
came
from
without
the
window
must
have
been
down
as
there
was
no
hole
in
the
glass
in
this
case
the
wind
which
was
blowing
from
the
would
infallibly
have
driven
in
the
rain
and
drops
would
still
show
on
the
cushions
he
must
look
for
them
without
delay
he
paused
to
ask
the
driver
one
more
question
whether
he
could
identify
the
voice
which
told
him
through
the
speaking
tube
to
stop
with
that
of
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
shilling
the
man
answering
affirmatively
willis
turned
to
one
of
the
plain
clothes
men
you
have
heard
this
driver
statement
jones
he
said
you
might
get
away
at
once
and
see
the
men
who
were
on
point
duty
both
at
the
corner
of
great
russell
street
where
the
tall
man
got
out
and
in
piccadilly
where
both
got
in
try
the
hotels
thereabouts
the
albemarle
and
any
others
you
can
think
of
if
you
can
get
any
information
follow
it
up
and
keep
me
advised
at
the
yard
of
your
the
man
hurried
away
and
willis
moved
over
once
more
to
the
taxi
the
assistant
had
by
this
time
finished
his
flashlight
photographs
and
the
inspector
picking
up
the
bicycle
lamp
looked
again
into
the
interior
a
moment
examination
showed
him
there
were
no
raindrops
on
the
cushions
but
his
search
nevertheless
was
not
unproductive
looking
more
carefully
this
time
than
previously
he
noticed
on
the
floor
of
the
cab
a
dark
object
almost
hidden
beneath
the
seat
he
drew
it
out
it
was
a
piece
of
thick
black
cloth
about
a
yard
square
considerably
mystified
he
held
it
up
by
two
corners
and
then
his
puzzle
became
solved
in
the
cloth
were
two
small
holes
and
round
one
of
them
the
fabric
was
charred
and
bore
the
characteristic
smell
of
burned
powder
it
was
clear
what
had
been
done
with
the
object
doubtless
of
hiding
the
flash
as
well
as
of
muffling
the
report
the
murderer
had
covered
his
weapon
with
a
double
thickness
of
heavy
cloth
no
doubt
it
had
admirably
achieved
its
purpose
and
willis
seized
it
eagerly
in
the
hope
that
it
might
furnish
him
with
a
clue
as
to
its
owner
he
folded
it
and
set
it
aside
for
further
examination
turning
back
to
the
body
under
his
direction
it
was
lifted
out
placed
on
an
ambulance
stretcher
provided
by
the
railwaymen
and
taken
to
a
disused
office
close
by
there
the
clothes
were
removed
and
while
the
doctors
busied
themselves
with
the
remains
willis
went
through
the
pockets
and
arranged
their
contents
on
one
of
the
desks
the
clothes
themselves
revealed
but
little
information
the
waterproof
and
shoes
it
is
true
bore
the
makers
labels
but
both
these
articles
were
the
products
of
large
firms
and
inquiry
at
their
premises
would
be
unlikely
to
lead
to
any
result
none
of
the
garments
bore
any
name
or
identifiable
mark
willis
then
occupied
himself
the
contents
of
the
pockets
besides
the
gold
watch
and
chain
bunch
of
keys
knife
cigarette
case
loose
coins
and
other
small
objects
which
a
man
such
as
the
deceased
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
carry
there
were
two
to
which
the
inspector
turned
with
some
hope
of
help
the
first
was
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
which
proved
to
be
a
receipted
hotel
bill
it
showed
that
a
coburn
and
another
had
stayed
in
the
peveril
hotel
in
russell
square
during
the
previous
four
days
when
willis
saw
it
he
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
it
would
doubtless
offer
a
ready
means
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
deceased
as
well
possibly
as
of
the
other
in
whom
willis
was
already
even
more
interested
moreover
so
good
a
clue
must
be
worked
without
delay
he
called
over
the
second
plain
clothes
man
take
this
bill
to
the
peveril
matthews
he
ordered
find
out
if
the
dead
man
is
this
coburn
and
if
possible
get
on
the
track
of
his
companion
if
i
do
get
anything
better
here
i
shall
follow
you
round
but
keep
the
yard
advised
of
your
movements
in
any
before
the
man
left
willis
examined
the
second
object
it
was
a
but
it
proved
rather
disappointing
it
contained
two
five
pound
bank
of
england
notes
nine
one
pound
and
three
ten
shilling
treasury
notes
the
return
half
of
a
railway
ticket
from
hull
to
king
cross
a
great
northern
cloakroom
ticket
a
few
visiting
cards
inscribed
mr
francis
coburn
and
lastly
the
photograph
by
cramer
of
regent
sweet
of
a
pretty
girl
of
about
twenty
willis
mentally
noted
the
three
possible
clues
these
articles
seemed
to
suggest
inquiries
in
hull
the
discovery
of
the
girl
through
cramer
and
third
and
most
important
luggage
or
a
parcel
in
some
great
northern
cloakroom
which
on
recovery
might
afford
him
help
the
presence
of
the
money
also
seemed
important
as
this
showed
that
the
motive
for
the
murder
had
not
been
robbery
having
made
a
parcel
of
the
clothes
for
transport
to
the
yard
reduced
to
writing
the
statements
of
the
driver
and
of
the
porter
who
had
made
the
discovery
and
arranged
with
the
doctors
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
body
willis
closed
and
locked
the
taxi
and
sent
it
in
charge
of
a
constable
to
scotland
yard
then
with
the
cloakroom
ticket
he
went
round
to
see
if
he
could
find
the
office
which
had
issued
it
the
rooms
were
all
shut
for
the
night
but
an
official
from
the
stationmaster
office
went
round
with
him
and
after
a
brief
search
they
found
the
article
for
which
the
ticket
was
a
voucher
it
was
a
small
suitcase
locked
and
willis
brought
it
away
with
him
intending
to
open
it
at
his
leisure
his
work
at
the
station
being
by
this
time
complete
he
returned
to
the
yard
carrying
the
suitcase
there
though
it
was
growing
late
he
forced
the
lock
and
sat
down
to
examine
the
contents
but
from
them
he
received
no
help
the
bag
contained
just
the
articles
which
a
man
in
circumstances
would
naturally
carry
on
a
week
or
a
fortnight
trip
a
suit
of
clothes
clean
linen
toilet
appliances
and
such
like
nowhere
could
willis
find
anything
of
interest
telephone
messages
meanwhile
had
come
in
from
the
two
plain
clothes
men
jones
reported
that
he
had
interviewed
all
the
constables
who
had
been
on
point
duty
at
the
places
in
question
but
without
result
nor
could
any
of
the
staffs
of
the
neighboring
hotels
or
restaurants
assist
him
the
call
from
the
peveril
conveyed
slightly
more
information
the
manageress
so
matthews
said
had
been
most
courteous
and
had
sent
for
several
members
of
her
staff
in
the
hope
that
some
of
them
might
be
able
to
answer
his
questions
but
the
sum
total
of
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
was
not
great
in
the
first
place
it
was
evident
that
the
deceased
was
coburn
himself
it
appeared
that
he
was
accompanied
by
a
miss
coburn
whom
the
manageress
believed
to
be
his
daughter
he
had
been
heard
addressing
her
as
madeleine
the
two
had
arrived
in
time
for
dinner
five
days
previously
registering
f
coburn
and
miss
coburn
and
had
left
about
eleven
on
the
morning
of
the
murder
on
each
of
the
four
days
of
their
stay
they
had
been
out
a
good
deal
but
they
had
left
and
returned
at
different
hours
and
therefore
appeared
not
to
have
spent
their
time
together
they
seemed
however
on
very
affectionate
terms
no
address
had
been
left
to
which
letters
might
be
forwarded
and
it
was
not
known
where
the
two
visitors
had
intended
to
go
when
they
left
neither
the
manageress
nor
any
of
the
staff
had
seen
anyone
resembling
the
tall
man
inspector
willis
was
considerably
disappointed
by
the
news
he
had
hoped
that
coburn
would
have
been
the
murderer
and
that
he
would
have
left
some
trace
from
which
his
identity
could
have
been
ascertained
however
the
daughter
information
would
no
doubt
be
valuable
and
his
next
care
must
be
to
find
her
and
learn
her
story
she
might
of
course
save
him
the
trouble
by
herself
coming
forward
she
would
be
almost
certain
to
see
an
account
of
the
murder
in
the
papers
and
even
if
not
her
father
disappearance
would
inevitably
lead
her
to
communicate
with
the
police
but
willis
could
not
depend
on
this
she
might
for
example
have
left
the
previous
day
on
a
voyage
and
a
considerable
time
might
elapse
before
she
learned
of
the
tragedy
no
he
would
have
to
trace
her
as
if
she
herself
were
the
assassin
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
after
one
nothing
more
could
be
done
that
night
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
turned
his
steps
homewards
next
morning
he
was
back
at
the
yard
by
eight
his
first
care
was
to
the
taxi
by
daylight
for
some
mark
or
article
left
by
its
recent
occupants
he
was
extraordinarily
thorough
and
painstaking
scrutinizing
every
inch
of
the
floor
and
cushions
and
trying
the
door
handles
and
window
straps
for
finger
marks
but
without
success
he
went
over
once
again
the
clothes
the
dead
man
was
wearing
as
well
as
those
in
the
suitcase
took
prints
from
the
dead
man
fingers
and
began
to
get
things
in
order
for
the
inquest
next
he
saw
horton
and
learned
that
coburn
had
been
killed
by
a
bullet
from
an
exceedingly
small
automatic
pistol
one
evidently
selected
to
make
the
minimum
of
noise
and
flash
and
from
which
a
long
carry
was
not
required
when
the
details
were
complete
he
thought
it
would
not
be
too
early
to
call
at
the
peveril
and
begin
the
search
for
miss
coburn
he
therefore
sent
for
a
taxi
and
a
few
minutes
later
was
seated
in
the
office
of
the
manageress
she
repeated
what
matthews
had
already
told
him
and
he
personally
interviewed
the
various
servants
with
whom
the
coburns
had
come
in
contact
he
also
searched
the
rooms
they
had
occupied
examined
with
a
mirror
the
blotting
paper
on
a
table
at
which
the
young
lady
had
been
seen
to
write
and
interrogated
an
elderly
lady
visitor
with
whom
she
had
made
acquaintance
but
he
learned
nothing
the
girl
had
vanished
completely
and
he
could
see
no
way
in
which
he
might
be
able
to
trace
her
he
sat
down
in
the
lounge
and
gave
himself
up
to
thought
and
then
suddenly
an
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
started
sat
for
a
moment
rigid
then
gave
a
little
gasp
lord
he
muttered
but
i
a
blamed
idiot
how
in
hades
did
i
miss
that
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
hurried
out
of
the
lounge
chapter
a
promising
clue
the
consideration
which
had
thus
suddenly
occurred
to
inspector
willis
was
the
extraordinary
importance
of
the
fact
that
the
tall
traveller
had
spoken
through
the
tube
to
the
driver
he
marveled
how
he
could
have
overlooked
its
significance
to
speak
through
a
taxi
tube
one
must
hold
up
the
mouthpiece
and
that
mouthpiece
is
usually
made
of
vulcanite
or
some
similar
substance
what
better
surface
willis
thought
delightedly
but
anxiously
could
be
found
for
recording
if
only
the
tall
man
had
made
the
blunder
of
omitting
to
wear
gloves
he
would
have
left
evidence
which
might
hang
him
and
he
willis
like
the
cursed
imbecile
that
he
was
had
missed
the
point
goodness
only
knew
if
he
was
not
already
too
late
if
so
he
thought
grimly
it
was
all
up
with
his
career
at
the
yard
he
ran
to
the
telephone
a
call
to
the
yard
advised
him
that
the
taxi
driver
on
being
informed
he
was
no
longer
required
had
left
with
his
vehicle
he
rapidly
rang
up
the
man
employers
asking
them
to
stop
the
cab
directly
they
came
in
touch
with
it
then
hurrying
out
of
the
hotel
he
hailed
a
taxi
and
drove
to
the
rank
on
which
the
man
was
stationed
his
luck
was
in
there
were
seven
vehicles
on
the
stand
and
his
man
having
but
recently
arrived
had
only
worked
up
to
the
middle
of
the
queue
the
sweat
was
standing
in
large
drops
on
inspector
willis
brow
as
he
eagerly
asked
had
the
tube
been
touched
since
leaving
scotland
yard
and
his
relief
when
he
found
he
was
still
in
time
was
overwhelming
rather
unsteadily
he
entered
the
vehicle
and
ordered
the
driver
to
return
to
the
yard
on
arrival
he
was
not
long
in
making
his
test
sending
for
his
apparatus
he
carefully
powdered
the
vulcanite
mouthpiece
and
he
could
scarcely
suppress
a
cry
of
satisfaction
when
he
saw
shaping
themselves
before
his
eyes
three
of
the
clearest
prints
he
had
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
come
across
on
one
side
of
the
mouthpiece
was
the
mark
of
a
right
thumb
and
on
the
other
those
of
a
first
and
second
finger
lord
he
muttered
to
himself
that
was
a
near
thing
if
i
had
missed
it
i
could
have
left
the
yard
for
good
and
all
it
the
first
thing
the
chief
would
have
asked
his
delight
was
unbounded
here
was
as
perfect
and
definite
evidence
as
he
could
have
wished
for
if
he
could
find
the
man
whose
fingers
fitted
the
marks
that
would
be
the
end
of
his
case
he
left
the
courtyard
intending
to
return
to
the
peveril
and
resume
the
tracing
of
miss
coburn
but
before
he
reached
the
door
of
the
great
building
he
was
stopped
a
gentleman
had
called
to
see
him
on
urgent
business
connected
with
the
case
it
was
merriman
merriman
almost
incoherent
with
excitement
and
distress
he
still
carried
the
newspaper
in
his
hand
which
had
so
much
upset
him
willis
pulled
forward
a
chair
invited
the
other
to
be
seated
and
took
the
paper
the
paragraph
was
quite
short
and
read
mystery
of
a
a
tragedy
which
recalls
the
detective
novel
the
mystery
of
the
hansom
cab
occurred
last
evening
in
one
of
the
most
populous
thoroughfares
in
london
it
appears
that
about
eight
two
men
engaged
a
taxi
in
piccadilly
to
take
them
to
king
cross
near
the
oxford
street
end
of
tottenham
court
road
the
driver
was
ordered
to
stop
one
of
the
men
alighted
bade
to
his
companion
and
told
the
driver
to
proceed
to
king
cross
where
his
friend
would
settle
up
on
reaching
the
station
there
was
no
sign
of
the
friend
and
a
search
revealed
him
lying
dead
in
the
taxi
with
a
bullet
wound
in
his
heart
from
papers
found
on
the
body
the
deceased
is
believed
to
be
a
francis
coburn
but
his
residence
has
not
yet
been
inspector
willis
laid
down
the
paper
and
turned
to
his
visitor
you
are
interested
in
the
case
sir
he
inquired
i
knew
him
i
think
merriman
stammered
at
least
i
know
someone
of
the
name
i
willis
glanced
keenly
at
the
newcomer
here
was
a
man
who
must
judging
by
his
agitation
have
been
pretty
closely
connected
with
francis
coburn
suspicious
of
everyone
the
detective
recognized
that
there
might
be
more
here
than
met
the
eye
he
drew
out
his
notebook
i
am
glad
you
called
sir
he
said
pleasantly
we
shall
be
very
pleased
to
get
any
information
you
can
give
us
what
was
your
friend
like
his
quiet
conversational
manner
calmed
the
other
rather
tall
he
answered
anxiously
with
a
long
pale
face
and
small
black
pointed
i
afraid
sir
that
the
man
i
think
if
you
do
mind
you
had
better
see
if
you
can
identify
i
want
to
merriman
cried
leaping
to
his
feet
i
must
know
at
willis
rose
also
then
come
this
they
drove
quickly
across
town
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
tell
merriman
that
the
body
was
indeed
that
of
his
former
acquaintance
his
agitation
became
painful
you
right
he
cried
it
is
he
and
it
my
fault
oh
if
i
had
only
done
what
she
said
if
i
had
only
kept
out
of
it
he
wrung
his
hands
in
his
anguish
willis
was
much
interested
though
this
man
could
not
be
personally
guilty
he
was
not
tall
enough
for
one
thing
he
must
surely
know
enough
about
the
affair
to
put
the
inspector
on
the
right
track
the
latter
began
eagerly
to
await
his
story
merriman
for
his
part
was
anxious
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
tell
it
he
was
sick
to
death
of
plots
and
investigations
and
machinations
and
while
driving
to
the
yard
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
dead
man
were
indeed
madeleine
father
he
would
tell
the
whole
story
of
his
and
hilliard
investigations
into
the
doings
of
the
syndicate
when
therefore
they
were
back
in
the
inspector
room
he
made
a
determined
effort
to
pull
himself
together
and
speak
calmly
yes
he
said
i
know
him
he
lived
near
bordeaux
with
his
daughter
she
will
be
absolutely
alone
you
will
understand
that
i
must
go
out
to
her
by
the
first
train
but
until
then
i
am
at
your
service
you
are
a
relation
perhaps
no
only
an
acquaintance
but
i
going
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
and
i
may
as
well
say
once
for
all
that
it
is
my
earnest
hope
some
day
to
marry
miss
willis
bowed
and
inquired
is
miss
coburn
name
madeleine
yes
merriman
answered
surprise
and
eagerness
growing
in
his
face
then
willis
went
on
you
will
be
pleased
to
learn
that
she
is
not
in
france
at
least
i
think
not
she
left
the
peveril
hotel
in
russell
square
about
eleven
yesterday
merriman
sprang
to
his
feet
in
london
he
queried
excitedly
where
what
address
we
do
know
yet
but
we
shall
soon
find
her
now
sir
you
ca
do
anything
for
the
moment
and
i
am
anxious
to
hear
your
story
take
your
own
time
and
the
more
details
you
can
give
me
the
merriman
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
well
he
said
slowly
sitting
down
again
i
have
something
to
tell
you
inspector
my
friend
hilliard
claud
hilliard
of
the
customs
department
and
i
have
made
a
discovery
we
have
accidentally
come
on
what
we
believe
is
a
criminal
conspiracy
we
do
know
for
what
purpose
except
that
it
is
something
big
and
fraudulent
we
were
coming
to
the
yard
in
any
case
to
tell
what
we
had
learned
but
this
murder
has
precipitated
things
we
can
no
longer
delay
giving
our
information
the
only
thing
is
that
i
should
have
liked
hilliard
to
be
here
to
tell
it
instead
of
me
for
our
discovery
is
really
due
to
i
can
see
hilliard
afterwards
meantime
tell
me
the
story
merriman
thereupon
related
his
and
hilliard
adventures
and
experiences
from
his
own
first
accidental
visit
to
the
clearing
when
he
noticed
the
changing
of
the
lorry
number
right
up
to
his
last
meeting
with
coburn
when
the
latter
expressed
his
intention
of
breaking
away
from
the
gang
he
hid
nothing
explaining
without
hesitation
his
reasons
for
urging
the
delay
in
informing
the
authorities
even
though
he
quite
realized
his
action
made
him
to
some
extent
an
accomplice
in
the
conspiracy
willis
was
much
more
impressed
by
the
story
than
he
would
have
admitted
though
it
sounded
wild
and
unlikely
then
was
a
ring
of
truth
in
merriman
manner
which
went
far
to
convince
the
other
of
its
accuracy
he
did
not
believe
either
that
anyone
could
have
invented
such
a
story
it
very
improbability
was
an
argument
for
its
truth
and
if
it
were
true
what
a
vista
it
opened
up
to
himself
the
solution
of
the
murder
problem
would
be
gratifying
enough
but
it
was
a
mere
nothing
compared
to
the
other
if
he
could
search
out
and
bring
to
naught
such
a
conspiracy
as
merriman
story
indicated
he
would
be
a
made
man
it
would
be
the
crowning
point
of
his
career
and
would
bring
him
measurably
nearer
to
that
cottage
and
garden
in
the
country
to
which
for
years
past
he
had
been
looking
forward
therefore
no
care
and
trouble
would
be
too
great
to
spend
on
the
matter
putting
away
thoughts
of
self
therefore
and
deliberately
concentrating
on
the
matter
in
hand
he
set
himself
to
consider
in
detail
what
his
visitor
had
told
him
and
get
the
story
clear
in
his
mind
then
slowly
and
painstakingly
he
began
to
ask
questions
i
take
it
merriman
that
your
idea
is
that
coburn
was
murdered
by
a
member
of
the
syndicate
yes
and
i
think
he
foresaw
his
fate
i
think
when
he
told
them
he
was
going
to
break
with
them
they
feared
he
might
betray
them
and
wanted
to
be
on
the
safe
any
of
them
a
tall
stoutly
built
man
captain
beamish
is
tall
and
strongly
built
but
i
should
not
say
he
was
describe
he
stooped
and
was
a
little
but
even
then
he
was
tall
if
he
had
held
himself
up
he
would
have
been
a
big
man
he
had
a
heavy
face
with
a
big
jaw
thin
lips
and
a
vindictive
willis
though
not
given
to
jumping
to
conclusions
felt
suddenly
thrilled
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
an
early
development
in
the
case
would
be
the
taking
of
the
impressions
of
captain
beamish
right
thumb
and
forefinger
he
asked
several
more
questions
and
going
over
the
story
again
took
copious
notes
then
for
some
time
he
sat
in
silence
considering
what
he
had
heard
at
first
sight
he
was
inclined
to
agree
with
merriman
that
the
deceased
had
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of
a
member
of
the
syndicate
and
if
so
it
was
not
unlikely
that
all
or
most
of
the
members
were
party
to
it
from
the
mere
possibility
of
this
it
followed
that
the
most
urgent
thing
for
the
moment
was
to
prevent
the
syndicate
suspecting
his
knowledge
he
turned
again
to
his
visitor
i
suppose
you
realize
merriman
that
if
all
these
details
you
have
given
me
are
correct
you
yourself
are
in
a
position
of
some
danger
i
know
it
but
i
am
not
afraid
it
is
the
possible
danger
to
miss
coburn
that
has
upset
me
so
i
understand
sir
the
inspector
returned
sympathetically
but
it
follows
that
for
both
your
sakes
you
must
act
very
cautiously
so
as
to
disarm
any
suspicions
these
people
may
have
of
i
am
quite
in
your
hands
good
then
let
us
consider
your
course
of
action
now
first
of
all
about
the
inquest
it
will
be
held
this
evening
at
five
you
will
have
to
give
evidence
and
we
shall
have
to
settle
very
carefully
what
that
evidence
will
be
no
breath
of
suspicion
against
the
syndicate
must
leak
merriman
nodded
you
must
identify
the
deceased
and
if
asked
you
must
tell
the
story
of
your
two
visits
to
the
clearing
you
must
speak
without
the
slightest
hesitation
but
you
must
of
course
make
no
mention
of
the
changing
of
the
lorry
numbers
or
of
your
suspicions
nor
will
you
mention
your
visit
to
hull
you
will
explain
that
you
went
back
to
the
clearing
on
the
second
occasion
because
it
was
so
little
out
of
your
way
and
because
you
were
anxious
to
meet
the
coburns
again
while
your
friend
wanted
to
see
the
forests
of
les
merriman
again
nodded
then
both
you
and
your
friend
must
avoid
scotland
yard
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
rush
off
here
as
you
did
but
it
would
not
be
natural
for
you
to
return
and
there
is
no
reason
why
hilliard
should
come
at
all
if
i
want
to
see
either
of
you
i
shall
ring
up
and
arrange
a
place
of
meeting
and
just
two
other
things
the
first
is
that
i
need
hardly
warn
you
to
be
as
circumspect
in
your
conversation
as
in
your
evidence
keep
in
mind
that
each
stranger
that
you
may
meet
may
be
morton
or
some
other
member
of
the
gang
the
second
is
that
i
should
like
to
keep
in
touch
with
you
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
case
any
question
might
crop
up
before
the
inquest
where
will
you
be
i
shall
stay
in
my
club
rover
in
cranbourne
street
you
can
ring
me
good
willis
answered
rising
to
his
feet
then
let
me
say
again
how
pleased
i
am
to
have
met
you
and
heard
your
story
five
then
if
you
do
hear
to
the
when
merriman
had
taken
his
leave
the
inspector
sat
on
at
his
desk
lost
in
thought
this
case
bade
fair
to
be
the
biggest
he
had
ever
handled
and
he
was
anxious
to
lay
his
plans
so
as
to
employ
his
time
to
the
best
advantage
two
clearly
defined
lines
of
inquiry
had
already
opened
out
and
he
was
not
clear
which
to
follow
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
obvious
routine
investigation
suggested
directly
by
the
murder
that
comprised
the
finding
of
miss
coburn
the
learning
of
coburn
life
history
the
tracing
of
his
movements
during
the
last
four
or
five
days
the
finding
of
the
purchaser
of
the
black
cloth
and
the
following
up
of
clues
discovered
during
these
inquiries
the
second
line
was
that
connected
with
the
activities
of
the
syndicate
and
willis
was
inclined
to
believe
that
a
complete
understanding
of
these
would
automatically
solve
the
problem
of
the
murder
he
was
wondering
whether
he
should
not
start
an
assistant
on
the
routine
business
of
the
tragedy
while
himself
concentrating
on
the
business
when
his
cogitations
were
brought
to
an
end
by
a
messenger
a
lady
had
called
in
connection
with
the
case
miss
madeleine
coburn
thought
willis
as
he
gave
orders
for
her
to
be
shown
to
his
room
and
when
she
entered
he
instantly
recognized
the
original
of
the
photograph
madeleine
face
was
dead
white
and
there
was
a
strained
look
of
horror
in
her
eyes
but
she
was
perfectly
calm
and
miss
coburn
willis
said
as
he
rose
and
bowed
i
am
afraid
i
can
guess
why
you
have
called
you
saw
the
account
in
the
paper
she
hesitated
is
it
my
father
willis
told
her
as
gently
as
he
could
she
sat
quite
still
for
a
few
moments
while
he
busied
himself
with
some
papers
then
she
asked
to
see
the
body
when
they
had
returned
to
willis
room
he
invited
her
to
sit
down
again
i
very
deeply
regret
miss
coburn
he
said
to
have
to
trouble
you
at
this
time
with
questions
but
i
fear
you
will
have
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquest
this
afternoon
and
it
will
be
easier
for
yourself
to
make
a
statement
now
so
that
only
what
is
absolutely
necessary
need
be
asked
you
madeleine
seemed
stunned
by
the
tragedy
and
she
spoke
as
if
in
a
dream
i
am
ready
to
do
what
is
he
thanked
her
and
began
by
inquiring
about
her
father
history
coburn
it
appeared
had
had
a
public
school
and
college
training
but
his
father
dying
when
he
was
just
twenty
and
leaving
the
family
in
somewhat
poor
circumstances
he
had
gone
into
business
as
a
clerk
in
the
hopwood
manufacturing
company
a
large
engineering
works
in
the
midlands
in
this
he
had
risen
until
he
held
the
important
position
of
cashier
and
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
had
lived
in
happiness
and
comfort
during
the
latter
girlhood
but
some
six
years
previous
to
the
tragedy
which
had
just
taken
place
a
change
had
come
over
the
household
in
the
first
place
coburn
had
developed
a
painful
illness
and
had
dragged
out
a
miserable
existence
for
the
three
years
before
her
death
at
the
same
time
whether
from
the
expense
of
the
illness
or
from
other
causes
miss
coburn
did
not
know
financial
embarrassment
seemed
to
descend
on
her
father
one
by
one
their
small
luxuries
were
cut
off
then
their
house
had
to
be
given
up
and
they
had
moved
to
rooms
in
a
rather
poor
locality
of
the
town
their
crowning
misfortune
followed
rapidly
coburn
gave
up
his
position
at
the
works
and
for
a
time
actual
want
stared
them
in
the
face
then
this
syndicate
had
been
formed
and
coburn
had
gone
into
it
as
the
manager
of
the
loading
station
miss
coburn
did
not
know
the
reason
of
his
leaving
the
engineering
works
but
she
suspected
there
had
been
friction
as
his
disposition
for
a
time
had
changed
and
he
had
lost
his
bright
manner
and
vivacity
he
had
however
to
a
large
extent
recovered
while
in
france
she
was
not
aware
either
of
the
terms
on
which
he
had
entered
the
syndicate
but
she
imagined
he
shared
in
the
profits
instead
of
receiving
a
salary
these
facts
which
willis
obtained
by
astute
questioning
seemed
to
him
not
a
little
suggestive
from
what
coburn
had
himself
told
merriman
it
looked
as
if
there
had
been
some
secret
in
his
life
which
had
placed
him
in
the
power
of
the
syndicate
and
the
inspector
wondered
whether
this
might
not
be
connected
with
his
leaving
the
engineering
works
at
all
events
inquiries
there
seemed
to
suggest
a
new
line
of
attack
should
such
become
necessary
willis
then
turned
to
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
it
appeared
that
about
a
fortnight
earlier
coburn
announced
that
he
was
crossing
to
london
for
the
annual
meeting
of
the
syndicate
and
as
he
did
not
wish
his
daughter
to
be
alone
at
the
clearing
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
accompany
him
they
travelled
by
the
girondin
to
hull
and
coming
on
to
london
put
up
at
the
peveril
coburn
had
been
occupied
off
and
on
during
the
four
days
they
had
remained
there
but
the
evenings
they
had
spent
together
in
amusements
on
the
night
of
the
murder
coburn
was
to
have
left
for
hull
to
return
to
france
by
the
girondin
his
daughter
going
by
an
earlier
train
to
eastbourne
where
she
was
to
have
spent
ten
days
with
an
aunt
except
for
what
coburn
had
said
about
the
meeting
of
the
syndicate
madeleine
did
not
know
anything
of
his
business
in
town
nor
had
she
seen
any
member
of
the
syndicate
after
leaving
the
ship
having
taken
notes
of
her
statements
willis
spoke
of
the
inquest
and
repeated
the
instructions
he
had
given
merriman
as
to
the
evidence
then
he
told
her
of
the
young
man
visit
and
referring
to
his
anxiety
on
her
behalf
asked
if
he
might
acquaint
him
with
her
whereabouts
she
thankfully
acquiesced
and
willis
who
was
anxious
that
her
mind
should
be
kept
occupied
until
the
inquest
pushed
his
good
offices
to
the
extent
of
arranging
a
meeting
between
the
two
the
inquest
elicited
no
further
information
formal
evidence
of
identification
was
given
the
doctors
deposed
that
death
was
due
to
a
bullet
from
an
exceedingly
small
bore
automatic
pistol
the
cab
driver
and
porter
told
their
stories
and
the
jury
returned
the
obvious
verdict
of
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
the
precautions
were
observed
and
not
a
word
was
uttered
which
could
have
given
a
hint
to
any
member
of
the
syndicate
that
the
bona
fides
of
his
organization
was
suspected
two
days
later
when
the
funeral
was
over
merriman
took
miss
coburn
back
to
her
aunt
at
eastbourne
no
word
of
love
passed
his
lips
but
the
young
girl
seemed
pleased
to
have
his
company
and
before
parting
from
her
he
obtained
permission
to
call
on
her
again
he
met
the
aunt
for
a
few
moments
and
was
somewhat
comforted
to
find
her
a
kind
motherly
woman
who
was
evidently
sincerely
attached
to
the
now
fatherless
girl
he
had
told
madeleine
of
his
interview
with
her
father
and
she
had
not
blamed
him
for
his
part
in
the
matter
saying
that
she
had
believed
for
some
time
that
a
development
of
the
kind
was
inevitable
so
for
them
the
days
began
to
creep
wearily
past
merriman
paid
as
frequent
visits
to
eastbourne
as
he
dared
and
little
by
little
he
began
to
hope
that
he
was
making
progress
in
his
suit
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
bring
the
matter
to
a
head
the
girl
had
evidently
had
a
more
severe
shock
than
they
had
realized
at
first
and
she
became
listless
and
difficult
to
interest
in
passing
events
he
saw
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
and
he
set
himself
to
bide
his
time
with
the
best
patience
he
could
muster
chapter
a
mystifying
discovery
inspector
willis
was
more
than
interested
in
his
new
case
the
more
he
thought
over
it
the
more
he
realized
its
dramatic
possibilities
and
the
almost
public
interest
it
was
likely
to
arouse
as
well
as
the
importance
which
his
superiors
would
certainly
attach
to
it
in
other
words
the
influence
a
successful
handling
of
it
would
have
on
his
career
he
had
not
been
idle
since
the
day
of
the
inquest
now
a
week
past
to
begin
with
he
had
seen
hilliard
secretly
and
learned
at
first
hand
all
that
that
young
man
could
tell
him
next
he
had
made
sure
that
the
found
on
the
speaking
tube
were
not
those
of
coburn
and
he
remained
keenly
anxious
to
obtain
impressions
from
captain
beamish
fingers
to
compare
with
the
former
but
inquiries
from
the
port
officials
at
hull
made
by
wire
on
the
evening
of
the
inquest
showed
that
the
girondin
would
not
be
back
at
ferriby
for
eight
days
there
had
been
no
object
therefore
in
his
leaving
london
immediately
and
instead
he
had
busied
himself
by
trying
to
follow
up
the
movements
in
the
metropolis
and
learn
with
whom
he
had
associated
during
his
stay
in
his
search
for
clues
he
had
even
taken
the
hint
from
merriman
newspaper
and
bought
a
copy
of
the
mystery
of
a
hansom
cab
but
though
he
saw
that
this
clever
story
might
easily
have
inspired
the
crime
he
could
find
from
it
no
help
towards
its
solution
he
had
also
paid
a
flying
visit
to
the
manager
of
the
hopwood
manufacturing
company
in
sheffield
where
coburn
had
been
employed
from
him
he
had
learned
that
madeleine
surmise
was
correct
and
that
there
had
been
friction
before
her
father
left
in
point
of
fact
a
surprise
audit
had
revealed
discrepancies
in
the
accounts
some
money
was
missing
and
what
was
suspiciously
like
an
attempt
to
falsify
the
books
had
taken
place
but
the
thing
could
not
be
proved
coburn
had
paid
up
but
though
his
plea
that
he
had
made
a
genuine
clerical
error
had
been
accepted
his
place
had
been
filled
the
manager
expressed
the
private
opinion
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
subordinate
guilt
saying
also
that
it
was
well
known
that
during
the
previous
months
coburn
had
been
losing
money
heavily
through
gambling
where
he
had
obtained
the
money
to
meet
the
deficit
the
manager
did
not
know
but
he
believed
someone
must
have
come
forward
to
assist
him
this
information
interested
willis
keenly
supporting
as
it
seemed
to
do
his
idea
that
coburn
was
in
the
power
of
the
syndicate
or
one
of
its
members
if
for
example
one
of
these
men
on
the
lookout
for
helpers
in
his
conspiracy
had
learned
of
the
cashier
predicaments
it
was
conceivable
that
he
might
have
obtained
his
hold
by
advancing
the
money
needed
to
square
the
matter
in
return
for
a
signed
confession
of
guilt
this
was
of
course
the
merest
guesswork
but
it
at
least
indicated
to
willis
a
fresh
line
of
inquiry
in
case
his
present
investigation
failed
and
with
the
latter
he
was
becoming
exceedingly
disappointed
with
the
exception
of
the
facts
just
mentioned
he
had
learned
absolutely
nothing
to
help
him
coburn
might
as
well
have
vanished
into
thin
air
when
he
left
the
peveril
hotel
for
all
the
trace
he
had
left
willis
could
learn
neither
where
he
went
nor
whom
he
met
on
any
one
of
the
four
days
he
had
spent
in
london
he
congratulated
himself
therefore
that
on
the
following
day
the
girondin
would
be
back
at
ferriby
and
he
would
then
be
able
to
start
work
on
the
clue
that
evening
he
settled
himself
with
his
pipe
to
think
over
once
more
the
facts
he
had
already
learned
as
time
passed
he
found
himself
approaching
more
and
more
to
the
conclusion
reached
by
hilliard
and
merriman
several
weeks
before
that
the
secret
of
the
syndicate
was
the
essential
feature
of
the
case
what
were
these
people
doing
that
was
the
question
which
at
all
costs
he
must
answer
his
mind
reverted
to
the
two
theories
already
in
the
field
at
first
sight
that
of
brandy
smuggling
seemed
tenable
enough
and
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
steps
by
which
the
two
young
men
had
tried
to
test
it
at
the
loading
end
their
observations
were
admittedly
worthless
but
at
ferriby
they
seemed
to
have
made
a
satisfactory
investigation
unless
they
had
unknowingly
fallen
asleep
in
the
barrel
it
was
hard
to
see
how
they
could
have
failed
to
observe
contraband
being
set
ashore
had
any
been
unloaded
but
he
did
not
believe
they
had
fallen
asleep
people
were
usually
conscious
of
awakening
besides
there
was
the
testimony
of
menzies
the
pilot
it
was
hardly
conceivable
that
this
man
also
should
have
been
deceived
at
the
same
time
willis
decided
he
must
interview
him
so
as
to
form
his
own
opinion
of
the
man
reliability
another
possibility
occurred
to
him
which
none
of
the
amateur
investigators
appeared
to
have
thought
of
north
sea
trawlers
were
frequently
used
for
getting
contraband
ashore
was
the
girondin
transferring
illicit
cargo
to
such
vessels
while
at
sea
this
was
a
question
inspector
willis
felt
he
could
not
solve
it
would
be
a
matter
for
the
customs
department
but
he
knew
enough
about
it
to
understand
that
immense
difficulties
would
have
to
be
overcome
before
such
a
scheme
could
be
worked
firstly
there
was
the
size
of
the
fraud
six
months
ago
according
to
what
miss
coburn
overheard
the
syndicate
were
making
pounds
per
trip
and
probably
from
the
remarks
then
made
they
were
doing
more
today
and
meant
the
inspector
buried
himself
in
calculations
at
least
one
thousand
gallons
of
brandy
was
it
conceivable
that
trawlers
could
get
rid
of
one
thousand
gallons
every
ten
days
one
hundred
gallons
a
day
frankly
he
thought
it
impossible
in
fact
in
the
face
of
the
customs
officers
activities
he
doubted
if
such
a
thing
could
be
done
by
any
kind
of
machinery
that
could
be
devised
indeed
the
more
willis
pondered
the
smuggling
theory
the
less
likely
it
seemed
to
him
and
he
turned
to
consider
the
possibilities
of
miss
coburn
suggestion
of
false
note
printing
here
at
once
he
was
met
by
a
fact
which
he
had
not
mentioned
to
merriman
as
it
happened
the
circulation
of
spurious
treasury
notes
was
one
of
the
subjects
of
interest
to
scotland
yard
at
the
moment
notes
were
being
forged
and
circulated
in
large
numbers
furthermore
the
source
of
supply
was
believed
to
be
some
of
the
large
towns
in
the
midlands
leeds
being
particularly
suspected
but
leeds
was
on
the
direct
line
through
ferriby
and
comparatively
not
far
away
willis
felt
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
explore
to
the
uttermost
limit
all
the
possibilities
which
these
facts
opened
up
he
began
by
looking
at
the
matter
from
the
conspirators
point
of
view
supposing
they
had
overcome
the
difficulty
of
producing
the
notes
how
would
they
dispose
of
them
willis
could
appreciate
the
idea
of
locating
the
illicit
press
in
france
firstly
it
would
be
obvious
to
the
gang
that
the
early
discovery
of
a
fraud
of
the
kind
was
inevitable
its
existence
indeed
would
soon
become
common
property
but
this
would
but
slightly
affect
its
success
it
was
the
finding
of
the
source
of
supply
that
mattered
and
the
difficulty
of
this
was
at
once
the
embarrassment
of
the
authorities
and
the
opportunity
of
the
conspirators
secondly
english
notes
were
to
be
forged
and
circulated
in
england
therefore
it
was
from
the
english
police
that
the
source
of
supply
must
be
hidden
and
how
better
could
this
be
done
than
by
taking
it
out
of
england
altogether
the
english
police
would
look
in
england
for
what
they
wanted
the
attention
of
the
french
police
having
no
false
french
notes
to
deal
with
would
not
be
aroused
it
seemed
to
willis
that
so
far
he
was
on
firm
ground
the
third
point
was
that
granting
the
first
two
some
agency
would
be
required
to
convey
the
forged
notes
from
france
to
england
but
here
a
difficulty
arose
the
plan
seemed
altogether
too
elaborate
and
cumbrous
for
all
that
was
required
willis
as
merriman
had
done
earlier
pictured
the
passenger
with
the
padded
overcoat
and
the
handbag
this
traveller
it
seemed
would
meet
the
case
but
did
he
would
there
not
with
him
be
a
certain
risk
there
would
be
a
continuous
passing
through
customs
houses
frequent
searchings
of
the
faked
suitcase
accidents
happen
suppose
the
traveller
held
on
to
his
suitcase
too
carefully
some
customs
officer
might
become
suspicious
suppose
he
did
hold
on
carefully
enough
and
it
were
lost
yes
there
would
be
risks
small
doubtless
but
still
risks
and
the
gang
could
afford
them
as
willis
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
he
came
gradually
to
the
conclusion
that
the
elaboration
of
the
business
was
no
real
argument
against
its
having
been
designed
merely
to
carry
forged
notes
as
a
business
moreover
it
would
pay
or
almost
pay
it
would
furnish
a
secret
method
of
getting
the
notes
across
at
little
or
no
cost
and
as
a
blind
willis
felt
that
nothing
better
could
be
devised
the
scheme
visualized
itself
to
him
as
follows
somewhere
in
france
probably
in
some
cellar
in
bordeaux
was
installed
the
illicit
there
the
notes
were
produced
by
some
secret
method
they
were
conveyed
to
henri
when
his
took
him
into
the
city
and
he
in
turn
brought
them
to
the
clearing
and
handed
them
over
to
coburn
captain
beamish
and
bulla
would
then
take
charge
of
them
probably
hiding
them
on
the
girondin
in
some
place
which
would
defy
a
surprise
customs
examination
numbers
of
such
places
willis
felt
sure
could
be
arranged
especially
in
the
engine
room
the
cylinders
of
a
duplicate
set
of
pumps
disused
on
that
particular
trip
occurred
to
him
as
an
example
after
arrival
at
ferriby
there
would
be
ample
opportunity
for
the
notes
to
be
taken
ashore
and
handed
over
to
archer
and
archer
could
plant
stuff
on
old
nick
the
more
he
pondered
over
it
the
more
tenable
this
theory
seemed
to
inspector
willis
he
rose
and
began
pacing
the
room
frowning
heavily
more
than
tenable
it
seemed
a
sound
scheme
cleverly
devised
and
carefully
worked
out
indeed
he
could
think
of
no
means
so
likely
to
mislead
and
delude
suspicious
authorities
in
their
search
for
the
criminals
as
this
very
plan
two
points
however
think
as
he
might
he
could
not
reconcile
one
was
that
exasperating
puzzle
of
the
changing
of
the
lorry
number
plates
the
other
how
the
running
of
a
second
boat
to
swansea
would
increase
the
profits
of
the
syndicate
but
everything
comes
to
him
who
waits
and
at
last
he
got
an
idea
what
if
the
number
of
the
lorry
was
an
indication
to
the
printers
of
the
notes
as
to
whether
henri
was
or
was
not
in
a
position
to
take
over
a
consignment
would
some
such
sign
be
necessary
if
henri
suspected
he
was
under
observation
or
if
he
had
to
make
calls
in
unsuitable
places
he
would
require
a
secret
method
of
passing
on
the
information
to
his
accomplices
and
if
so
could
a
better
scheme
be
devised
than
that
of
showing
a
prearranged
number
on
his
lorry
willis
did
not
think
so
and
he
accepted
the
theory
for
what
it
was
worth
encouraged
by
his
progress
he
next
tackled
his
second
difficulty
how
the
running
of
a
second
boat
would
dispose
of
more
notes
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
arrive
at
no
conclusion
which
would
explain
the
point
it
depended
obviously
on
the
method
of
distribution
adopted
and
of
this
part
of
the
affair
he
was
entirely
ignorant
failure
to
account
for
this
did
not
therefore
necessarily
invalidate
the
theory
as
a
whole
and
with
the
theory
as
a
whole
he
was
immensely
pleased
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
fitted
all
the
known
facts
and
bore
the
stamp
of
probability
to
an
even
greater
degree
than
that
of
brandy
smuggling
but
theories
were
not
enough
he
must
get
ahead
with
his
investigation
accordingly
next
morning
he
began
his
new
inquiry
by
sending
a
telegram
to
beamish
landes
syndicate
ferriby
hull
could
you
meet
me
off
london
train
at
paragon
station
at
tomorrow
re
death
of
coburn
i
should
like
to
get
back
by
if
not
would
stay
and
go
out
to
ferriby
willis
scotland
he
travelled
that
same
day
to
hull
having
arranged
for
the
reply
to
be
sent
after
him
going
to
the
refreshment
room
at
the
paragon
he
had
a
conversation
with
the
barmaid
in
which
he
disclosed
his
official
position
and
passed
over
a
note
on
account
for
services
about
to
be
rendered
then
leaving
by
the
evening
train
he
returned
to
doncaster
where
he
spent
the
night
on
the
next
day
he
boarded
the
london
train
which
reaches
hull
at
at
paragon
station
he
soon
singled
out
beamish
from
description
sorry
for
asking
you
to
come
in
captain
beamish
he
apologized
but
i
was
anxious
if
possible
to
get
back
to
london
tonight
i
heard
of
you
from
miss
coburn
and
merriman
both
of
whom
read
of
the
tragedy
in
the
papers
and
severally
came
to
make
inquiries
at
the
yard
register
told
me
your
ship
came
in
here
so
i
came
along
to
see
you
in
the
hope
that
you
might
be
able
to
give
me
some
information
about
the
dead
man
which
might
suggest
a
line
of
inquiry
as
to
his
beamish
replied
politely
and
with
a
show
of
readiness
and
candor
no
trouble
to
meet
you
inspector
i
had
to
come
up
to
hull
in
any
case
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
tell
you
anything
i
can
about
poor
coburn
unfortunately
i
am
afraid
it
wo
be
much
when
our
syndicate
was
starting
we
wanted
a
manager
for
the
export
end
coburn
applied
there
was
a
personal
interview
he
seemed
suitable
and
he
was
appointed
on
trial
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
him
otherwise
except
that
he
made
good
and
i
may
say
that
in
the
two
years
of
our
acquaintance
i
always
found
him
not
only
pleasant
and
agreeable
to
deal
with
but
also
exceedingly
efficient
in
his
willis
asked
a
number
of
other
questions
harmless
questions
easily
answered
about
the
syndicate
and
coburn
work
ending
up
with
an
expression
of
thanks
for
the
other
trouble
and
an
invitation
to
adjourn
for
a
drink
beamish
accepting
the
inspector
led
the
way
to
the
refreshment
room
and
approached
the
counter
opposite
the
barmaid
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
the
previous
day
two
small
whiskies
please
he
ordered
having
asked
his
choice
the
girl
placed
the
two
small
tumblers
of
yellow
liquid
before
her
customers
and
willis
added
a
little
water
to
each
well
here
yours
he
said
and
raising
his
glass
to
his
lips
drained
the
contents
at
a
draught
captain
beamish
did
the
same
the
inspector
offer
of
a
second
drink
having
been
declined
the
two
men
left
the
refreshment
room
still
chatting
about
the
murdered
man
ten
minutes
later
captain
beamish
saw
the
inspector
off
in
the
london
train
but
he
did
not
know
that
in
the
van
of
that
train
there
was
a
parcel
labelled
to
inspector
willis
passenger
to
doncaster
by
which
contained
a
small
tumbler
smelling
of
whisky
and
carefully
packed
up
so
as
to
prevent
the
sides
from
being
rubbed
the
inspector
was
the
next
thing
to
excited
when
some
time
later
he
locked
the
door
of
his
bedroom
in
the
stag
head
hotel
at
doncaster
and
carefully
unpacking
the
tumbler
he
took
out
his
powdering
apparatus
and
examined
it
for
prints
with
satisfaction
he
found
his
little
ruse
had
succeeded
the
glass
bore
clearly
defined
marks
of
a
right
thumb
and
two
fingers
eagerly
he
compared
the
prints
with
those
he
had
found
on
the
taxi
and
then
he
suffered
disappointment
keen
and
deep
the
two
sets
were
dissimilar
so
his
theory
had
been
wrong
and
captain
beamish
was
not
the
murderer
after
all
he
realized
now
that
he
had
been
much
more
convinced
of
its
truth
than
he
had
had
any
right
to
be
and
his
chagrin
was
correspondingly
greater
he
had
indeed
been
so
sure
that
beamish
was
his
man
that
he
had
failed
sufficiently
to
consider
other
possibilities
and
now
he
found
himself
without
any
alternative
theory
to
fall
back
on
but
he
remained
none
the
less
certain
that
coburn
death
was
due
to
his
effort
to
break
with
the
syndicate
and
that
it
was
to
the
syndicate
that
he
must
look
for
light
on
the
matter
there
were
other
members
of
it
he
knew
of
two
archer
and
morton
and
there
might
be
more
one
of
whom
might
be
the
man
he
sought
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
next
business
must
be
to
find
those
other
members
ascertain
if
any
of
them
were
tall
men
and
if
so
obtain
a
copy
of
their
but
how
was
this
to
be
done
obviously
from
the
shadowing
of
the
members
whom
he
knew
that
was
captain
beamish
bulla
and
benson
the
ferriby
manager
of
these
beamish
and
bulla
were
for
the
most
part
at
sea
therefore
he
thought
his
efforts
should
be
concentrated
on
benson
it
was
with
a
view
to
some
such
contingency
that
he
had
alighted
at
doncaster
instead
of
returning
to
london
and
he
now
made
up
his
mind
to
return
on
the
following
day
to
hull
and
the
girondin
having
by
that
time
left
to
see
what
he
could
learn
at
the
ferriby
depot
he
spent
three
days
shadowing
benson
without
coming
on
anything
in
the
slightest
degree
suspicious
the
manager
spent
each
of
the
days
at
the
wharf
until
about
six
then
he
walked
to
ferriby
station
and
took
the
train
to
hull
where
he
dined
spent
the
evening
at
some
place
of
amusement
and
returned
to
the
depot
by
a
late
train
on
the
fourth
day
as
the
same
program
seemed
to
be
in
prowess
willis
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
losing
time
and
must
take
some
more
energetic
step
he
determined
that
if
benson
left
the
depot
in
the
evening
as
before
he
would
try
to
effect
an
entrance
to
his
office
and
have
a
look
through
his
papers
shortly
after
six
from
the
hedge
behind
which
he
had
concealed
himself
he
saw
benson
appear
at
the
door
in
the
corrugated
iron
fence
and
depart
in
the
direction
of
ferriby
the
five
employees
had
left
about
an
hour
earlier
and
the
inspector
believed
the
works
were
entirely
deserted
after
giving
benson
time
to
get
clear
away
he
crept
from
his
hiding
place
and
approaching
the
depot
tried
the
gate
in
the
fence
it
was
locked
but
few
locks
were
proof
against
the
inspector
prowess
and
with
the
help
of
a
bent
wire
he
was
soon
within
the
enclosure
he
closed
the
gate
behind
him
and
glancing
carefully
round
approached
the
shed
the
door
of
the
office
was
also
locked
but
the
bent
wire
conquered
it
too
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
he
pushed
it
open
passed
through
and
closed
it
behind
him
the
room
was
small
finished
with
yellow
matchboarded
walls
and
ceiling
and
containing
a
closed
desk
a
table
littered
with
papers
a
vertical
file
two
cupboards
a
telephone
and
other
simple
office
requisites
two
doors
led
out
of
it
one
to
the
manager
bedroom
the
other
to
the
shed
thinking
that
those
could
wait
willis
settled
down
to
make
an
examination
of
the
office
he
ran
rapidly
though
methodically
through
the
papers
on
the
table
without
finding
anything
of
interest
all
referred
to
the
industry
and
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
business
was
carried
on
efficiently
next
he
tackled
the
desk
picking
the
lock
with
his
usual
skill
here
also
though
he
examined
everything
with
meticulous
care
his
search
was
fruitless
he
moved
to
the
cupboards
one
was
unfastened
and
contained
old
ledgers
account
books
and
the
like
none
being
of
any
interest
the
other
cupboard
was
locked
and
willis
quick
eyes
saw
that
the
woodwork
round
the
keyhole
was
much
scratched
showing
that
the
lock
was
frequently
used
again
the
wire
was
brought
into
requisition
and
in
a
moment
the
door
swung
open
revealing
to
the
inspector
astonished
gaze
a
telephone
considerably
puzzled
he
looked
round
to
the
wall
next
the
door
yes
he
had
not
been
mistaken
there
also
was
affixed
a
telephone
he
crossed
over
to
it
and
following
with
his
eye
the
run
of
the
wires
saw
that
it
was
connected
to
those
which
approached
the
shed
from
across
the
railway
with
what
then
did
this
second
instrument
communicate
there
were
no
other
wires
approaching
the
shed
nor
could
he
find
any
connection
to
which
it
could
be
attached
he
examined
the
instrument
more
closely
and
then
he
saw
that
it
was
not
of
the
standard
government
pattern
it
was
marked
the
curtiss
philadelphia
it
was
therefore
part
of
a
private
installation
and
as
such
illegal
as
the
british
government
hold
the
monopoly
for
all
telephones
in
the
country
at
least
it
would
be
illegal
if
it
were
connected
up
but
was
it
the
wires
passed
through
the
back
of
the
cupboard
into
the
wall
and
looking
down
willis
saw
that
one
of
the
wall
sheeting
boards
reaching
from
the
cupboard
to
the
floor
had
at
some
time
been
taken
out
and
replaced
with
screws
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
took
out
his
combination
pocket
knife
and
deftly
removing
the
screws
pulled
the
board
forward
his
surprise
was
not
lessened
when
he
saw
that
the
wires
ran
down
inside
the
wall
and
heavily
insulated
disappeared
into
the
ground
beneath
the
shed
is
it
possible
that
they
have
a
cable
thought
the
puzzled
man
as
he
replaced
the
loose
board
and
screwed
it
fast
the
problem
had
to
stand
over
as
he
wished
to
complete
his
investigation
of
the
remainder
of
the
building
but
though
he
searched
the
entire
premises
with
the
same
meticulous
thoroughness
that
he
had
displayed
in
dealing
with
the
papers
he
came
on
nothing
else
which
in
any
way
excited
his
interest
he
let
himself
out
and
relocking
the
various
doors
behind
him
walked
to
hassle
and
from
there
returned
to
his
hotel
in
hull
he
was
a
good
deal
intrigued
by
his
discovery
of
the
secret
telephone
that
it
was
connected
up
and
frequently
used
he
was
certain
both
from
the
elaboration
of
its
construction
and
from
the
marking
round
the
cupboard
keyhole
he
wondered
if
he
could
without
discovery
tap
the
wires
and
overhear
the
business
discussed
had
the
wires
been
carried
on
poles
the
matter
would
have
been
simple
but
as
things
were
he
would
have
to
make
his
connection
under
the
loose
board
and
carry
his
cable
out
through
the
wall
and
along
the
shore
to
some
point
at
which
the
receiver
would
be
hidden
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
but
in
default
of
something
better
he
would
have
tried
it
had
not
a
second
discovery
he
made
later
on
the
same
evening
turned
his
thoughts
into
an
entirely
new
channel
it
was
in
thinking
over
the
probable
purpose
of
the
telephone
that
he
got
his
idea
it
seemed
obvious
that
it
was
used
for
the
secret
side
of
the
enterprise
and
if
so
would
it
not
most
probably
connect
the
import
depot
of
the
secret
commodity
with
that
of
its
distribution
ferriby
wharf
was
the
place
of
import
but
the
distribution
as
the
conversations
overheard
indicated
lay
not
in
the
hands
of
benson
but
of
archer
what
if
the
telephone
led
to
archer
there
was
another
point
the
difficulty
of
laying
a
secret
land
wire
would
be
so
enormous
that
in
the
nature
of
things
the
line
must
be
short
it
must
either
lead
willis
imagined
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
estuary
or
to
somewhere
quite
near
but
if
both
these
conclusions
were
sound
it
followed
that
archer
himself
must
be
found
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
could
he
learn
anything
from
following
up
this
idea
he
borrowed
a
directory
of
hull
and
began
looking
up
all
the
archers
given
in
the
alphabetical
index
there
were
fifteen
and
of
these
one
immediately
attracted
his
attention
it
read
archer
archibald
charles
the
elms
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
still
but
slightly
after
ten
taking
his
hat
he
walked
to
the
police
station
and
saw
the
sergeant
on
duty
yes
sir
said
the
man
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
i
know
the
gentleman
he
is
the
managing
director
of
ackroyd
and
holt
distillery
about
between
ferriby
and
and
what
is
he
like
in
appearance
willis
continued
concealing
the
interest
this
statement
had
aroused
a
big
man
sir
the
sergeant
answered
tall
and
broad
too
clean
shaven
with
heavy
features
very
determined
willis
had
food
for
thought
as
he
returned
to
his
hotel
merriman
had
been
thrilled
when
he
learned
of
the
proximity
of
the
distillery
to
the
syndicate
depot
seeing
therein
an
argument
in
favor
of
the
brandy
smuggling
theory
this
new
discovery
led
willis
at
first
to
take
the
same
view
but
the
considerations
which
hilliard
had
pointed
out
occurred
to
him
also
and
though
he
felt
a
little
puzzled
he
was
inclined
to
dismiss
the
matter
as
a
coincidence
though
after
his
recent
experience
he
was
even
more
averse
to
jumping
to
conclusions
than
formerly
willis
could
not
but
believe
that
he
was
at
last
on
a
hopeful
scent
at
all
events
his
first
duty
was
clear
he
must
find
this
archibald
charles
archer
and
obtain
prints
of
his
fingers
next
morning
found
him
again
at
ferriby
once
more
looking
southwards
from
the
concealment
of
a
cluster
of
bushes
but
this
time
the
object
of
his
attention
was
no
longer
the
syndicate
depot
instead
he
focused
his
powerful
glasses
on
the
office
of
the
distillery
about
a
tall
stoutly
built
man
strode
up
to
the
building
and
entered
his
dress
indicated
that
he
was
of
the
employer
class
and
from
the
way
in
which
a
couple
of
workmen
touched
their
caps
as
he
passed
willis
had
no
doubt
he
was
the
managing
director
for
some
three
hours
the
inspector
lay
hidden
then
he
suddenly
observed
the
tall
man
emerge
from
the
building
and
walk
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
ferriby
immediately
the
inspector
crept
down
the
hedge
nearer
to
the
road
so
as
to
see
his
quarry
pass
at
close
quarters
it
happened
that
as
the
man
came
abreast
of
willis
a
small
coming
from
the
direction
of
ferriby
also
reached
the
same
spot
but
instead
of
passing
it
slowed
down
and
its
occupant
hailed
the
tall
man
hallo
archer
he
shouted
can
i
give
you
a
lift
thanks
the
big
man
answered
it
would
be
a
kindness
i
have
unexpectedly
to
go
into
hull
and
my
own
car
is
out
of
run
you
in
in
quarter
of
an
no
hurry
if
i
am
in
by
half
past
one
it
will
do
i
am
lunching
with
frazer
at
the
criterion
at
that
the
stopped
the
big
man
entered
and
the
vehicle
moved
away
as
soon
as
it
was
out
of
sight
willis
emerged
from
his
and
hurrying
to
the
station
caught
the
train
to
hull
twenty
minutes
later
he
passed
through
the
swing
doors
of
the
criterion
the
hotel
as
is
well
known
is
one
of
the
most
fashionable
in
hull
and
at
the
luncheon
hour
the
restaurant
was
well
filled
glancing
casually
round
willis
could
see
his
new
acquaintance
seated
at
a
table
in
the
window
in
close
conversation
with
a
florid
individual
of
the
successful
business
man
type
all
the
tables
in
the
immediate
vicinity
were
occupied
and
willis
could
not
get
close
by
in
the
hope
of
overhearing
some
of
the
conversation
as
he
had
intended
he
therefore
watched
the
others
from
a
distance
and
when
they
had
moved
to
the
lounge
he
followed
them
he
heard
them
order
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
then
a
sudden
idea
came
into
his
head
rising
he
followed
the
waiter
through
the
service
door
i
want
a
small
job
done
he
said
while
a
note
changed
hands
i
am
from
scotland
yard
and
i
want
the
of
the
men
who
have
just
ordered
coffee
polish
the
outsides
of
the
liqueur
glasses
thoroughly
and
only
lift
them
by
the
stems
then
when
the
men
have
gone
let
me
have
the
he
returned
to
the
lounge
and
presently
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
archer
lift
his
glass
by
the
bowl
between
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
to
empty
his
liqueur
into
his
coffee
hall
an
hour
later
he
was
back
in
his
hotel
with
the
carefully
packed
glass
a
very
few
minutes
sufficed
for
the
test
the
impressions
showed
up
well
and
this
time
the
inspector
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
compared
them
with
those
of
the
taxi
they
were
the
same
his
quest
was
finished
archer
was
the
murderer
of
francis
coburn
for
a
minute
or
two
in
his
satisfaction
the
inspector
believed
his
work
was
done
he
had
only
to
arrest
archer
take
official
prints
of
his
fingers
and
he
had
all
the
necessary
proof
for
a
conviction
but
a
moment
consideration
showed
him
that
his
labors
were
very
far
indeed
from
being
over
what
he
had
accomplished
was
only
a
part
of
the
task
he
had
set
himself
it
was
a
good
deal
more
likely
that
the
other
members
of
the
syndicate
were
confederates
in
the
murder
as
well
as
in
the
illicit
trade
he
must
get
his
hands
on
them
too
but
if
he
arrested
archer
he
would
thereby
destroy
all
chance
of
accomplishing
the
greater
feat
the
very
essence
of
success
lay
in
lulling
to
rest
any
doubts
that
their
operations
were
suspect
which
might
have
entered
into
the
minds
of
the
members
of
the
syndicate
no
he
would
do
nothing
at
present
and
he
once
more
felt
himself
up
against
the
question
which
had
baffled
hilliard
and
merriman
what
was
the
syndicate
doing
until
he
had
answered
this
therefore
he
could
not
rest
and
how
was
it
to
be
done
after
some
thought
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
most
promising
clue
was
the
secret
telephone
and
he
made
up
his
mind
the
next
day
he
would
try
to
find
its
other
end
and
if
necessary
tap
the
wires
and
listen
in
to
any
conversation
which
might
take
place
chapter
inspector
willis
listens
in
inspector
willis
was
a
good
deal
exercised
by
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
should
have
archer
shadowed
if
the
managing
director
conceived
the
slightest
suspicion
of
his
danger
he
would
undoubtedly
disappear
and
a
man
of
his
ability
would
not
be
likely
to
leave
many
traces
on
the
other
hand
willis
wondered
whether
even
scotland
yard
men
could
shadow
him
sufficiently
continuously
to
be
a
real
safeguard
without
giving
themselves
away
and
if
that
happened
he
might
indeed
arrest
archer
but
it
would
be
to
any
chance
of
getting
his
confederates
after
anxious
thought
he
decided
to
take
the
lesser
risk
he
would
not
bring
assistants
into
the
matter
but
would
trust
to
his
own
skill
to
carry
on
the
investigation
unnoticed
by
the
distiller
though
the
discovery
of
archer
identity
seemed
greatly
to
strengthen
the
probability
that
the
secret
telephone
led
to
him
willis
could
not
state
this
positively
and
he
felt
it
was
the
next
point
to
be
ascertained
the
same
argument
that
he
had
used
before
seemed
to
apply
that
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
wiring
the
point
of
connection
must
be
close
to
the
depot
archer
office
was
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
away
while
his
house
the
elms
was
over
a
mile
the
chances
were
therefore
in
favor
of
the
former
it
followed
that
he
must
begin
by
searching
archer
office
for
the
other
receiver
and
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
problem
of
how
this
could
best
be
done
and
first
as
to
the
lie
of
the
offices
he
called
at
the
electric
generating
station
and
having
introduced
himself
confidentially
to
the
manager
in
his
official
capacity
asked
to
see
the
man
whose
business
it
was
to
inspect
the
lights
of
the
distillery
from
him
he
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
rough
plan
of
the
place
it
appeared
that
the
offices
were
on
the
first
floor
fronting
along
the
line
archer
private
office
occupying
the
end
of
the
suite
and
the
corner
of
the
building
nearest
to
the
syndicate
wharf
and
therefore
to
ferriby
the
supervisor
believed
that
it
had
two
windows
looking
to
the
front
and
side
respectively
but
was
not
sure
that
afternoon
inspector
willis
returned
to
the
distillery
and
secreting
himself
in
the
same
hiding
place
as
before
watched
until
the
staff
had
left
the
building
then
strolling
casually
along
the
lane
he
observed
that
the
two
telephone
wires
which
approached
across
the
fields
led
to
the
third
window
from
the
ferriby
end
of
the
first
floor
row
that
be
the
main
office
he
said
to
himself
but
there
will
probably
be
an
extension
to
archer
own
room
now
i
wonder
he
looked
about
him
the
hedge
bounding
the
river
side
of
the
lane
ran
up
to
the
corner
of
the
building
after
another
hasty
glance
round
willis
squeezed
through
and
from
immediately
below
scrutinized
the
side
window
of
the
managing
director
room
and
then
he
saw
something
which
made
him
chuckle
with
pleasure
within
a
few
inches
of
the
architrave
of
the
window
there
was
a
and
from
the
top
of
the
window
to
the
spout
he
saw
stretching
what
looked
like
a
double
cord
it
was
painted
the
same
color
as
the
walls
and
had
he
not
been
looking
out
specially
he
would
not
have
seen
it
a
moment
glance
at
the
foot
of
the
spout
showed
him
his
surmise
was
correct
pushed
in
behind
it
and
normally
concealed
by
it
were
two
insulated
wires
which
ran
down
the
wall
from
the
window
and
disappeared
into
the
ground
with
the
spout
got
it
first
shot
thought
the
inspector
delightedly
as
he
moved
away
so
as
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
any
chance
onlooker
another
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
and
after
estimating
the
height
and
position
of
the
window
he
turned
and
ran
his
eye
once
more
over
his
surroundings
about
fifty
yards
from
the
distillery
and
behind
the
hedge
fronting
the
lane
stood
the
cottage
which
hilliard
and
merriman
had
noticed
it
was
in
a
bad
state
of
repair
having
evidently
been
unoccupied
for
a
long
time
in
the
gable
directly
opposite
the
managing
director
office
was
a
broken
window
willis
moved
round
behind
the
house
and
once
again
producing
his
bent
wire
in
a
few
moments
had
the
back
door
open
slipping
inside
he
passed
through
the
rooms
and
up
the
decaying
staircase
until
he
reached
the
broken
window
from
it
as
he
had
hoped
he
found
he
had
a
good
view
into
the
office
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
minutes
past
seven
i
do
it
tonight
he
murmured
and
quietly
leaving
the
house
he
hurried
to
ferriby
station
and
so
to
hull
some
five
hours
later
he
left
the
city
again
this
time
by
motor
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
lane
which
ran
past
the
distillery
dismissed
the
vehicle
and
passed
down
the
lane
he
was
carrying
a
light
folding
ladder
a
spade
a
field
telephone
a
coil
of
insulated
wire
and
some
small
tools
the
night
was
very
dark
the
crescent
moon
would
not
rise
for
another
couple
of
hours
and
a
thick
pall
of
cloud
cut
off
all
light
from
the
stars
a
faint
wind
stirred
the
branches
of
the
few
trees
in
the
neighborhood
and
sighed
across
the
wide
spaces
of
open
country
the
inspector
walked
slowly
being
barely
able
to
see
against
the
sky
the
tops
of
the
hedges
which
bounded
the
lane
except
for
himself
no
living
creature
seemed
to
be
abroad
arrived
at
his
destination
willis
felt
his
way
to
the
gap
in
the
hedge
which
he
had
used
before
passed
through
and
with
infinite
care
raised
his
ladder
to
the
window
of
archer
office
he
could
not
see
the
window
but
he
checked
the
position
of
the
ladder
by
the
measurements
from
the
hedge
then
he
slowly
ascended
he
found
he
had
gauged
his
situation
correctly
and
he
was
soon
on
the
sill
of
the
window
trying
with
his
knife
to
push
back
the
hasp
this
he
presently
accomplished
and
then
after
an
effort
so
great
that
he
thought
he
would
be
beaten
he
succeeded
in
raising
the
sash
a
minute
later
he
was
in
the
room
his
first
care
was
to
pull
down
the
thick
blinds
of
blue
holland
with
which
the
windows
were
fitted
then
to
the
door
he
noiselessly
shot
the
bolt
in
the
lock
having
thus
provided
against
surprise
he
began
his
investigation
there
in
the
top
corner
of
the
side
window
were
the
wires
they
followed
the
miter
of
the
window
architrave
to
match
and
then
passing
down
for
a
few
inches
at
the
outside
of
the
moldings
ran
along
the
picture
rail
round
the
room
concealed
in
the
groove
behind
it
following
in
the
same
way
the
miter
of
the
architrave
they
disappeared
though
a
door
in
the
back
wall
of
the
office
willis
softly
opened
the
door
which
was
not
locked
and
peered
into
a
small
store
evidently
used
for
filing
the
wires
were
carried
down
the
back
of
the
architrave
molding
and
along
the
top
of
the
wainscoting
until
finally
they
disappeared
into
the
side
of
one
of
a
series
of
cupboards
which
lined
the
wall
opposite
the
door
the
cupboard
was
locked
but
with
the
help
of
the
bent
wire
it
soon
stood
open
and
willis
flashing
in
a
beam
from
his
electric
torch
saw
with
satisfaction
that
he
had
attained
at
least
one
of
his
objects
a
telephone
receiver
similar
to
that
at
the
syndicate
depot
was
within
he
examined
the
remaining
contents
of
the
room
but
found
nothing
of
interest
until
he
came
to
the
door
this
was
solidly
made
and
edged
with
rubber
and
he
felt
sure
that
it
would
be
almost
completely
it
was
moreover
furnished
with
a
lock
pretty
complete
arrangement
willis
thought
as
he
turned
back
to
the
outer
office
here
he
conducted
another
of
his
meticulous
examinations
but
unfortunately
with
a
negative
result
having
silently
unlocked
the
door
and
pulled
up
the
blinds
he
climbed
out
on
the
window
sill
and
closed
the
window
he
was
unable
to
refasten
the
hasp
and
had
therefore
to
leave
this
evidence
of
his
visit
though
he
hoped
and
believed
it
would
not
be
noticed
lifting
down
the
ladder
he
carried
it
to
the
cottage
and
hid
it
therein
part
of
his
task
was
done
and
he
must
wait
for
daylight
to
complete
the
remainder
when
some
three
hours
later
the
coming
dawn
had
made
objects
visible
he
again
emerged
armed
with
his
tools
and
coil
of
insulated
wire
digging
a
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
he
connected
his
wires
just
below
the
ground
level
to
those
of
the
telephone
then
inserting
his
spade
along
the
face
of
the
wall
from
the
pipe
to
the
hedge
he
pushed
back
the
adjoining
soil
placed
the
wires
in
the
narrow
trench
thus
made
and
trod
the
earth
back
into
place
when
the
hole
at
the
had
been
filled
practically
no
trace
remained
of
the
disturbance
the
ground
along
the
inside
of
the
hedge
being
thickly
grown
over
with
weeds
and
grass
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
dig
a
trench
for
the
wire
simply
bedding
it
beneath
the
foliage
but
he
made
a
spade
cut
across
the
sward
from
the
hedge
to
the
cottage
door
sank
in
the
wire
and
trod
out
the
cut
once
he
had
passed
the
tiny
cable
beneath
the
front
door
he
no
longer
troubled
to
hide
it
but
laid
it
across
the
floors
and
up
the
stairs
to
the
broken
window
there
he
attached
the
field
receiver
affixing
it
to
his
ear
so
as
to
be
ready
for
eventualities
it
was
by
this
time
half
past
six
and
broad
daylight
but
willis
had
seen
no
sign
of
life
and
he
believed
his
actions
had
been
unobserved
he
ate
a
few
sandwiches
then
lighting
his
pipe
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
smoked
contentedly
his
case
at
last
was
beginning
to
prosper
the
finding
of
murderer
was
of
course
an
event
of
outstanding
importance
and
now
the
discovery
of
the
telephone
was
not
only
valuable
for
its
own
sake
but
was
likely
to
bring
in
a
rich
harvest
of
information
from
the
messages
he
hoped
to
intercept
indeed
he
believed
he
could
hardly
fail
to
obtain
from
this
source
a
definite
indication
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
conspiracy
about
eight
he
could
see
from
his
window
a
number
of
workmen
arrive
at
the
distillery
followed
an
hour
later
by
a
clerical
staff
after
them
came
archer
passing
from
his
car
to
the
building
with
his
purposeful
stride
almost
immediately
he
appeared
in
his
office
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
began
to
work
until
nearly
midday
willis
watched
him
going
through
papers
dictating
letters
and
receiving
subordinates
then
about
two
minutes
to
the
hour
he
saw
him
look
at
his
watch
rise
and
approach
the
door
from
the
other
office
which
was
in
willis
line
of
vision
behind
the
desk
he
stooped
over
the
lock
as
if
turning
the
key
and
then
the
watcher
excitement
rose
as
the
other
disappeared
out
of
sight
in
the
direction
of
the
filing
room
willis
was
not
disappointed
almost
immediately
he
heard
the
faint
call
of
the
tiny
buzzer
and
then
a
voice
archer
voice
he
believed
from
what
he
had
heard
in
the
hotel
lounge
called
softly
are
you
there
there
was
an
immediate
answer
willis
had
never
heard
benson
speak
but
he
presumed
that
the
reply
must
be
from
him
anything
to
report
archer
queried
no
everything
going
on
as
no
strangers
poking
round
and
asking
questions
and
no
traces
of
a
visitor
while
you
were
away
good
it
probably
a
false
alarm
beamish
may
have
been
i
hope
so
but
he
seemed
very
suspicious
of
that
scotland
yard
man
said
he
was
sure
he
was
out
for
more
than
he
pretended
he
thought
he
was
too
easily
satisfied
with
the
information
he
got
and
that
some
of
his
questions
were
too
foolish
to
be
inspector
willis
sat
up
sharply
this
was
a
blow
to
his
dignity
and
he
felt
not
a
little
scandalized
but
he
had
no
time
to
consider
his
feelings
archer
was
speaking
again
i
think
we
had
better
be
on
the
safe
side
if
you
have
the
slightest
suspicion
do
wait
to
report
to
me
wire
at
once
to
henri
at
the
clearing
this
message
take
it
down
so
that
there
be
no
mistake
hundred
props
wanted
if
possible
send
next
cargo
got
that
he
will
understand
it
is
our
code
for
danger
send
blank
cargoes
until
further
notice
then
if
a
search
is
made
nothing
will
be
found
because
there
wo
be
anything
there
to
very
good
it
a
pity
to
lose
the
money
but
i
expect
you
we
ca
take
avoidable
risks
now
about
yourself
i
see
you
brought
no
stuff
up
last
night
could
i
had
a
rotten
bilious
attack
i
started
but
had
to
go
back
to
bed
again
could
better
yes
all
right
now
then
you
bring
the
usual
up
tonight
very
well
now
what
about
ten
for
tomorrow
the
switch
snapped
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
watcher
saw
archer
return
to
his
office
bend
for
a
moment
over
the
lock
of
the
door
then
reseat
himself
at
his
desk
i
got
them
now
he
thought
triumphantly
i
got
them
at
last
tonight
i
take
them
in
whatever
they
he
smiled
in
anticipation
by
jove
he
went
on
it
was
lucky
they
sent
nothing
up
last
night
or
they
would
have
taken
me
and
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
me
he
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
excellence
of
the
telephone
scheme
there
was
nothing
anywhere
about
it
to
excite
suspicion
and
it
kept
archer
in
touch
with
the
illicit
undertaking
while
enabling
him
to
hold
himself
absolutely
aloof
from
all
its
members
if
the
rest
of
the
organization
was
as
good
it
was
not
surprising
that
hilliard
and
merriman
had
been
baffled
but
the
puzzle
was
now
solved
the
mystery
at
an
end
that
night
so
willis
assured
himself
the
truth
would
be
known
he
remained
in
his
hiding
place
all
day
until
indeed
he
had
watched
the
workers
at
the
distillery
leave
and
the
gray
shadows
of
evening
had
begun
to
descend
then
he
hid
the
telephone
and
wire
in
a
cupboard
stealthily
left
the
house
and
after
a
rapid
glance
round
hurried
along
the
lane
towards
ferriby
he
caught
the
train
to
hull
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
at
the
police
station
there
he
saw
the
superintendent
and
after
a
little
trouble
got
him
to
fall
in
with
the
plan
which
he
had
devised
as
a
result
of
their
conference
a
large
car
left
the
city
shortly
before
nine
in
which
were
seated
inspector
willis
and
eight
picked
constables
in
plain
clothes
they
drove
to
the
end
of
the
ferriby
lane
where
the
men
dismounted
and
took
cover
behind
some
shrubs
while
the
car
returned
towards
hull
it
was
almost
but
not
quite
dark
there
was
no
moon
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
were
showing
brightly
a
faint
air
in
which
there
was
already
a
touch
of
chill
sighed
gently
through
the
leaves
rising
at
intervals
almost
to
a
breeze
then
falling
away
again
to
nothing
lights
were
showing
here
and
there
yellow
gleams
from
unshaded
windows
signal
lamps
from
the
railway
navigation
lights
from
the
river
except
for
the
sound
of
the
retreating
car
and
the
dull
roar
of
a
distant
train
the
night
was
very
still
a
night
in
fact
suitable
for
the
inspector
purpose
the
nine
men
moved
silently
down
the
lane
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
their
feet
making
no
sound
on
the
hard
surface
willis
went
first
and
as
the
others
reached
him
he
posted
them
in
the
positions
on
which
he
had
previously
decided
one
man
took
cover
behind
the
hedge
of
the
lane
a
short
distance
on
the
distillery
side
of
the
wharf
another
behind
a
pile
of
old
material
on
the
railway
at
the
same
place
a
third
hid
himself
among
some
bushes
on
the
open
ground
between
the
railway
and
the
river
while
a
fourth
crept
as
near
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
as
the
tide
would
allow
so
as
to
watch
approaches
from
the
water
when
they
were
in
position
willis
felt
convinced
no
one
could
leave
the
syndicate
depot
for
the
distillery
without
being
seen
the
other
four
men
he
led
on
to
the
distillery
placing
them
in
a
similar
manner
on
its
ferriby
side
if
by
some
extraordinary
chance
the
messenger
with
the
stuff
should
pass
the
first
cordon
the
second
he
was
satisfied
would
take
him
he
left
himself
free
to
move
about
as
might
appear
desirable
the
country
was
extraordinarily
deserted
not
one
of
the
nine
men
had
seen
a
living
soul
since
they
left
their
motor
and
willis
felt
certain
that
his
dispositions
had
been
carried
out
in
absolute
secrecy
he
crossed
the
fence
on
to
the
railway
by
climbing
up
the
ladder
of
a
signal
he
was
able
to
see
the
windows
of
the
shed
over
the
galvanized
fence
all
were
in
darkness
and
he
wondered
if
benson
had
gone
on
his
customary
expedition
into
hull
to
satisfy
himself
on
this
point
he
hid
beneath
a
wagon
which
was
standing
on
the
siding
close
to
the
gate
in
the
fence
if
the
manager
were
returning
by
his
usual
train
he
would
be
due
in
a
few
minutes
and
willis
intended
to
wait
and
see
it
was
not
long
before
a
sharp
footfall
told
that
someone
was
coming
along
the
lane
the
unknown
paused
at
the
stile
climbed
over
and
walking
more
carefully
across
the
rails
approached
the
door
willis
whose
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
gloom
could
make
out
the
dim
form
of
a
man
showing
like
a
smudge
of
intensified
blackness
against
the
obscurity
beyond
he
unlocked
the
door
passed
through
slammed
it
behind
him
and
his
retreating
steps
sounded
from
within
finally
another
door
closed
in
the
distance
and
silence
again
reigned
willis
crawled
out
from
beneath
his
truck
and
once
more
climbed
the
signal
ladder
the
windows
of
benson
office
were
now
lighted
up
but
the
blinds
being
drawn
the
inspector
could
see
nothing
within
after
about
half
an
hour
he
observed
the
same
phenomenon
as
hilliard
and
merriman
had
witnessed
the
light
was
carried
from
the
office
to
the
bedroom
and
a
few
minutes
later
disappeared
altogether
the
ladder
on
which
he
was
standing
appearing
to
willis
to
offer
as
good
an
observation
post
as
he
could
hope
to
get
he
climbed
to
the
little
platform
at
the
top
and
seating
himself
leaned
back
against
the
timber
upright
and
continued
his
watch
though
he
was
keenly
interested
by
his
adventure
time
soon
began
to
drag
it
was
cramped
on
the
little
seat
and
he
could
not
move
freely
for
fear
of
falling
off
then
to
his
dismay
he
began
to
grow
sleepy
he
had
of
course
been
up
all
the
previous
night
and
though
he
had
dozed
a
little
during
his
vigil
in
the
deserted
house
he
had
not
really
rested
he
yawned
stretched
himself
carefully
and
made
a
determined
effort
to
overcome
his
drowsiness
he
was
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
successful
he
got
the
start
of
his
life
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
an
earthquake
had
come
the
signal
post
trembled
and
swayed
while
with
a
heavy
metallic
clang
objects
moved
through
the
darkness
near
his
head
he
gripped
the
rail
and
then
he
laughed
as
he
remembered
that
railway
signals
were
movable
this
one
had
just
been
lowered
for
a
train
presently
it
roared
past
him
enveloping
him
in
a
cloud
of
steam
which
for
an
instant
was
lit
bright
as
day
by
the
almost
white
beam
that
poured
out
of
the
open
door
of
the
engine
firebox
then
the
steam
clearing
there
appeared
a
strip
of
faintly
lit
ground
on
either
side
of
the
flying
carriage
roofs
it
promptly
vanished
red
tail
lamps
appeared
leaping
away
there
was
a
rattle
of
wheels
over
siding
connections
and
with
a
rapidly
decreasing
roar
the
visitation
was
past
for
a
moment
there
remained
the
quickly
moving
spot
of
lighted
steam
then
it
too
vanished
once
again
the
signal
post
swayed
as
the
heavy
mechanism
of
the
arm
dropped
back
into
the
on
position
and
then
all
was
once
more
still
the
train
had
effectually
wakened
willis
and
he
set
himself
with
a
renewed
vigor
to
this
task
sharply
he
watched
the
dark
mass
of
the
shed
with
its
surrounding
enclosure
keenly
he
listened
for
some
sound
of
movement
within
but
all
remained
dark
and
silent
towards
one
in
the
morning
he
descended
from
his
perch
and
went
the
round
of
his
men
all
were
alert
and
all
were
unanimous
that
no
one
had
passed
the
time
dragged
slowly
on
the
wind
had
risen
somewhat
and
clouds
were
banking
towards
the
it
grew
colder
and
willis
fancied
there
must
be
a
touch
of
frost
about
four
he
went
round
his
pickets
for
the
second
time
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
surprised
that
the
attempt
had
been
delayed
so
long
and
when
some
two
hours
later
the
coming
dawn
began
to
brighten
the
eastern
sky
and
still
no
sign
had
been
observed
his
chagrin
waxed
keen
as
the
light
increased
he
withdrew
his
men
to
cover
and
about
seven
when
it
was
no
longer
possible
that
anything
would
be
attempted
he
sent
them
by
ones
and
twos
to
await
their
car
at
the
agreed
rendezvous
he
was
more
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
his
trap
than
he
would
have
believed
possible
what
he
wondered
could
have
happened
why
had
the
conspirators
abandoned
their
purpose
had
he
given
himself
away
he
went
over
in
his
mind
every
step
he
had
taken
and
he
did
not
see
how
any
one
of
them
could
have
become
known
to
his
enemies
or
how
any
of
his
actions
could
have
aroused
their
suspicions
no
it
was
not
he
felt
sure
that
they
had
realized
their
danger
some
other
quite
accidental
circumstance
had
intervened
to
cause
them
to
postpone
the
transfer
of
the
stuff
for
that
night
but
what
extraordinary
hard
luck
for
him
he
had
obtained
his
helpers
from
the
superintendent
only
after
considerable
trouble
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
again
would
be
much
greater
and
not
the
least
annoying
thing
was
that
he
a
london
man
one
indeed
of
the
best
men
at
the
yard
had
been
made
to
look
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
these
provincial
police
and
hungry
though
he
was
he
set
his
teeth
and
determined
that
he
would
return
to
the
cottage
in
the
hope
of
learning
the
reason
of
his
failure
from
the
conversation
which
he
expected
would
take
place
between
archer
and
benson
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
that
day
repeating
therefore
his
proceedings
of
the
previous
morning
he
regained
his
point
of
vantage
at
the
broken
window
again
he
watched
the
staff
arrive
and
again
observed
archer
enter
and
take
his
place
at
his
desk
he
was
desperately
sleepy
and
it
required
all
the
power
of
his
strong
will
to
keep
himself
awake
but
at
last
his
perseverance
was
rewarded
and
at
exactly
he
saw
archer
bolt
his
door
and
disappear
towards
the
filing
room
a
moment
later
the
buzzer
sounded
are
you
there
once
again
came
in
archer
voice
followed
by
the
astounding
phrase
i
see
you
brought
up
that
stuff
last
yes
i
brought
up
two
hundred
and
fifty
was
benson
amazing
reply
inspector
willis
gasped
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
so
he
had
been
tricked
after
all
in
spite
of
his
carefully
placed
pickets
in
spite
of
his
own
ceaseless
watchfulness
he
had
been
tricked
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
illicit
somethings
had
been
conveyed
right
under
his
and
his
men
noses
from
the
depot
to
the
distillery
almost
choking
with
rage
and
amazement
he
heard
archer
continue
i
had
a
lucky
deal
after
our
conversation
yesterday
got
seven
hundred
unexpectedly
planted
you
may
send
up
a
couple
of
hundred
extra
tonight
if
you
right
i
shall
benson
answered
and
the
conversation
ceased
inspector
willis
swore
bitterly
as
he
lay
back
on
the
dusty
floor
and
pillowed
his
head
on
his
hands
and
then
while
he
still
fumed
and
fretted
outraged
nature
asserted
herself
and
he
fell
asleep
he
woke
ravenously
hungry
as
it
was
getting
dusk
and
he
did
not
delay
long
in
letting
himself
out
of
the
house
regaining
the
lane
and
walking
to
ferriby
station
an
hour
later
he
was
dining
at
his
hotel
in
hull
chapter
the
secret
of
the
syndicate
a
night
rest
made
willis
once
more
his
own
man
and
next
morning
he
found
that
his
choking
rage
had
evaporated
and
that
he
was
able
to
think
calmly
and
collectedly
over
the
failure
of
his
plans
as
he
reconsidered
in
detail
the
nature
of
the
watch
he
had
kept
he
felt
more
than
ever
certain
that
his
cordons
had
not
been
broken
through
no
one
he
felt
satisfied
could
have
passed
unobserved
between
the
depot
and
the
distillery
and
in
spite
of
this
the
stuff
had
been
delivered
archer
and
benson
were
not
bluffing
to
put
him
off
the
scent
they
had
no
idea
they
were
overheard
and
therefore
had
no
reason
to
say
anything
except
the
truth
how
then
was
the
communication
being
made
surely
he
thought
if
these
people
could
devise
a
scheme
he
should
be
able
to
guess
it
he
was
not
willing
to
admit
his
brain
inferior
to
any
man
he
lit
his
pipe
and
drew
at
it
slowly
as
he
turned
the
question
over
in
his
mind
and
then
a
possible
solution
occurred
to
him
what
about
a
subterranean
connection
had
these
men
driven
a
tunnel
here
undoubtedly
was
a
possibility
to
drive
three
hundred
yards
of
a
heading
large
enough
for
a
stooping
man
to
pass
through
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
men
who
had
shown
the
skill
of
these
conspirators
the
soil
was
light
and
sandy
and
they
could
use
without
suspicion
as
much
timber
as
they
required
to
shore
up
their
work
it
was
true
they
would
have
to
pass
under
the
railway
but
that
again
was
a
matter
of
timbering
their
greatest
difficulty
he
imagined
would
be
in
the
disposal
of
the
surplus
earth
he
began
to
figure
out
what
it
would
mean
the
passageway
could
hardly
be
less
than
four
feet
by
five
to
allow
for
lining
and
this
would
amount
to
about
two
yards
of
material
to
the
yard
run
or
say
six
hundred
or
seven
hundred
cubic
yards
altogether
could
this
have
been
absorbed
in
the
filling
of
the
wharf
he
thought
so
the
wharf
was
a
large
structure
thirty
yards
by
thirty
at
least
and
eight
or
nine
feet
high
more
than
two
thousand
cubic
yards
of
filling
would
have
been
required
for
it
the
disposal
of
the
earth
therefore
would
have
presented
no
difficulty
all
that
came
out
of
the
tunnel
could
have
gone
into
the
wharf
three
times
over
a
tunnel
seemingly
being
a
practical
proposition
he
turned
his
attention
to
his
second
problem
how
could
he
find
out
whether
or
not
it
had
been
made
obviously
only
from
examination
at
one
or
other
end
if
it
existed
it
must
connect
with
cellars
at
the
depot
and
the
distillery
and
of
these
there
could
be
no
question
of
which
he
ought
to
search
the
depot
was
not
only
smaller
and
more
compact
but
it
was
deserted
at
intervals
if
he
could
not
succeed
at
the
syndicate
enclosure
he
would
have
no
chance
at
the
larger
building
it
was
true
he
had
already
searched
it
without
result
but
he
was
not
then
specially
looking
for
a
cellar
and
with
a
more
definite
objective
he
might
have
better
luck
he
decided
that
if
benson
went
up
to
hull
that
night
he
would
have
another
try
he
took
an
afternoon
train
to
ferriby
and
walking
back
towards
the
depot
took
cover
in
the
same
place
that
he
had
previously
used
there
sheltered
by
a
hedge
he
watched
for
the
manager
appearance
the
weather
had
from
the
inspector
point
of
view
changed
for
the
worse
the
sunny
days
had
gone
and
the
sky
was
overladen
with
clouds
a
cold
wind
blew
in
gustily
from
the
bringing
a
damp
fog
which
threatened
every
minute
to
turn
to
rain
and
flecking
the
waters
of
the
estuary
with
spots
of
white
willis
shivered
and
drew
up
his
collar
higher
round
his
ears
as
he
crouched
behind
the
wet
bushes
confound
it
he
thought
when
i
get
into
that
shed
i
shall
be
dripping
water
all
over
the
but
he
remained
at
his
post
and
in
due
course
he
was
rewarded
by
seeing
benson
appear
at
the
door
in
the
fence
and
after
locking
it
behind
him
start
off
down
the
railway
towards
ferriby
as
before
willis
waited
until
the
manager
had
got
clear
away
then
slipping
across
the
line
he
produced
his
bent
wire
opened
the
door
and
five
minutes
later
stood
once
more
in
the
office
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
seemed
clear
that
the
entrance
to
the
cellar
if
one
existed
would
be
hidden
it
was
therefore
for
secret
doors
or
moving
panels
that
he
must
look
he
began
by
ascertaining
the
thickness
of
all
the
walls
noting
the
size
of
the
rooms
so
as
to
calculate
those
he
could
not
measure
directly
he
soon
found
that
no
wall
was
more
than
six
inches
thick
and
none
could
therefore
contain
a
concealed
opening
this
narrowed
his
search
the
exit
from
the
building
could
only
be
through
a
in
the
floor
accordingly
he
set
to
work
in
the
office
crawling
torch
in
hand
along
the
boards
scrutinizing
the
joints
between
them
for
any
that
were
not
closed
with
dust
feeling
for
any
that
might
be
loose
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
boards
ran
in
one
length
across
the
floor
and
were
obviously
firmly
nailed
down
on
fixed
joists
he
went
to
the
bedroom
rolling
aside
the
mats
which
covered
the
floor
and
moving
the
furniture
back
and
forwards
but
here
he
had
no
better
result
the
remainder
of
the
shed
was
floored
with
concrete
and
a
less
meticulous
examination
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
surface
was
unbroken
nor
was
there
anything
either
on
the
wharf
itself
or
in
the
enclosure
behind
the
shed
which
could
form
a
cover
to
a
flight
of
steps
sorely
disappointed
willis
returned
once
more
to
the
office
and
sitting
down
went
over
once
again
in
his
mind
what
he
had
done
trying
to
think
if
there
was
a
point
on
the
whole
area
of
the
depot
which
he
had
overlooked
he
could
recall
none
except
the
space
beneath
a
large
wardrobe
in
the
next
room
which
owing
to
its
obvious
weight
he
had
not
moved
i
suppose
i
had
better
make
sure
he
said
to
himself
though
he
did
not
believe
so
massive
a
piece
of
furniture
could
have
been
pulled
backwards
and
forwards
without
leaving
scratches
on
the
floor
he
returned
to
the
bedroom
the
wardrobe
was
divided
into
two
portions
a
single
deep
drawer
along
the
bottom
and
above
it
a
kind
of
large
cupboard
with
a
central
door
he
seized
its
end
it
was
certainly
very
heavy
in
fact
he
found
himself
unable
to
move
it
he
picked
up
his
torch
and
examined
the
wooden
base
and
then
his
interest
grew
for
he
found
it
was
strongly
to
the
floor
considerably
mystified
he
tried
to
open
the
door
it
was
locked
and
though
with
his
wire
he
eventually
shot
back
the
bolt
the
trouble
he
had
proved
that
the
lock
was
one
of
first
quality
indeed
it
was
not
a
cupboard
lock
screwed
to
the
inside
of
the
door
as
might
have
been
expected
but
a
mortice
lock
hidden
in
the
thickness
of
the
wood
and
the
keyhole
came
through
to
the
inside
just
the
same
arrangement
as
is
usual
in
internal
house
doors
the
inside
of
the
wardrobe
revealed
nothing
of
interest
two
coats
and
waistcoats
a
sweater
and
some
other
clothes
were
hanging
from
hooks
at
the
back
otherwise
the
space
was
empty
why
he
wondered
as
he
stood
staring
in
should
it
be
necessary
to
lock
up
clothes
like
these
his
eyes
turned
to
the
drawer
below
and
he
seized
the
handles
and
gave
a
sharp
pull
the
drawer
was
evidently
locked
once
again
he
produced
his
wire
but
for
the
first
time
it
failed
him
he
flashed
a
beam
from
his
lamp
into
the
hole
and
then
he
saw
the
reason
the
hole
was
a
dummy
it
entered
the
wood
but
did
not
go
through
it
it
was
not
connected
to
a
lock
he
passed
the
light
round
the
edges
of
the
drawer
if
there
was
no
lock
to
fasten
it
why
had
he
been
unable
to
open
it
he
took
out
his
penknife
and
tried
to
push
the
blade
into
the
surrounding
space
it
would
not
penetrate
and
he
saw
that
there
was
no
space
but
merely
a
cut
half
an
inch
deep
in
the
wood
there
was
no
drawer
what
seemed
a
drawer
was
merely
a
blind
panel
inspector
willis
grew
more
and
more
interested
he
could
not
see
why
all
that
space
should
be
wasted
as
it
was
clear
from
the
way
in
which
the
wardrobe
was
finished
that
economy
in
construction
had
not
been
the
motive
once
again
he
opened
the
door
of
the
upper
portion
and
putting
his
head
inside
passed
the
beam
of
the
lamp
over
the
floor
this
time
he
gave
a
little
snort
of
triumph
the
floor
did
not
fit
tight
to
the
sides
all
round
was
a
space
of
some
eighth
of
an
inch
the
at
last
he
muttered
as
he
began
to
feel
about
for
some
hidden
spring
at
last
pressing
down
on
one
end
of
the
floor
he
found
that
it
sank
and
the
other
end
rose
in
the
air
revealing
a
square
of
inky
blackness
out
of
which
poured
a
stream
of
cold
damp
air
and
through
which
he
could
hear
with
the
echoing
sound
peculiar
to
vaults
the
splashing
and
churning
of
the
sea
his
torch
revealed
a
flight
of
steps
leading
down
into
the
darkness
having
examined
the
pivoted
floor
to
make
sure
there
was
no
secret
catch
which
could
fasten
and
imprison
him
below
he
stepped
on
to
the
ladder
and
began
to
descend
then
the
significance
of
the
mortice
lock
in
the
wardrobe
door
occurred
to
him
and
he
stopped
drew
the
door
to
behind
him
and
with
his
wire
locked
it
descending
farther
he
allowed
the
floor
to
drop
gently
into
place
above
his
head
thus
leaving
no
trace
of
his
passage
he
had
by
this
time
reached
the
ground
and
he
stood
flashing
his
torch
about
on
his
surroundings
he
was
in
a
cellar
so
low
in
the
roof
that
except
immediately
beneath
the
stairs
he
could
not
stand
upright
it
was
square
some
twelve
feet
either
way
and
from
it
issued
two
passages
one
apparently
running
down
under
the
wharf
the
other
at
right
angles
and
some
two
feet
lower
in
level
leading
as
if
towards
the
distillery
down
the
center
of
this
latter
ran
a
tiny
tramway
of
about
a
foot
gauge
on
which
stood
three
kegs
on
frames
in
the
upper
side
of
each
keg
was
fixed
a
to
the
under
side
a
two
insulated
wires
came
down
through
the
ceiling
below
the
cupboard
in
which
the
telephone
was
installed
and
ran
down
the
tunnel
towards
the
distillery
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
both
cellar
and
passages
were
supported
by
discolored
by
the
damp
and
marked
by
stains
of
earthy
water
which
had
oozed
from
the
spaces
between
they
glistened
with
moisture
but
the
air
though
cold
and
damp
was
fresh
that
and
the
noise
of
the
waves
which
reverberated
along
the
passage
under
the
wharf
seemed
to
show
that
there
was
an
open
connection
to
the
river
the
cellar
was
empty
except
for
a
large
wooden
tun
or
cask
which
reached
almost
to
the
ceiling
and
a
gunmetal
hand
pump
pipes
led
from
the
latter
one
to
the
tun
the
other
along
the
passage
under
the
wharf
on
the
side
of
the
tun
and
connected
to
it
at
top
and
bottom
was
a
vertical
glass
tube
protected
by
a
wooden
casing
evidently
a
gauge
as
beside
it
was
a
scale
headed
gallons
and
reading
from
at
the
bottom
to
at
the
top
a
liquid
filled
the
tube
up
to
the
figure
there
was
a
wooden
spigot
tap
in
the
side
of
the
tun
at
floor
level
and
the
tramline
ran
beneath
this
so
that
the
wheeled
kegs
could
be
pushed
below
it
and
filled
the
inspector
gazed
with
an
expression
of
almost
awe
on
his
face
lord
he
muttered
is
it
brandy
after
all
he
stooped
and
smelled
the
wooden
tap
and
the
last
doubt
was
removed
from
his
mind
he
gave
vent
to
a
comprehensive
oath
right
enough
it
was
hard
luck
here
he
had
been
hoping
to
bring
off
a
forged
note
coup
which
would
have
made
his
name
and
the
affair
was
a
job
for
the
customs
department
after
all
of
course
a
pretty
substantial
reward
would
be
due
to
him
for
his
discovery
and
there
was
his
murder
case
all
quite
satisfactory
but
forged
notes
were
more
in
his
line
and
he
felt
cheated
out
of
his
due
but
now
that
he
was
so
far
he
might
as
well
learn
all
he
could
the
more
complete
the
case
he
gave
in
the
larger
the
reward
moreover
his
own
curiosity
was
keenly
aroused
the
cellar
being
empty
save
for
the
tun
the
pump
and
the
small
tramway
and
trucks
he
turned
and
flashing
his
light
before
him
walked
slowly
along
the
passage
down
which
ran
the
pipe
he
was
he
felt
sure
passing
under
the
wharf
and
heading
towards
the
river
some
sixty
feet
past
the
pump
the
floor
of
the
passage
came
to
an
abrupt
end
falling
vertically
as
by
an
enormous
step
to
churning
waters
of
the
river
some
six
feet
below
at
first
in
the
willis
thought
he
had
reached
the
front
of
the
wharf
but
he
soon
saw
he
was
still
in
the
cellar
the
roof
ran
on
at
the
same
level
for
some
twenty
feet
farther
and
the
side
walls
here
about
five
feet
apart
went
straight
down
from
it
into
the
water
across
the
end
was
a
wall
sloping
outwards
at
the
bottom
and
made
of
horizontal
separated
by
spaces
of
two
or
three
inches
willis
immediately
realized
that
these
props
must
be
those
placed
behind
the
inner
or
raking
row
of
piles
which
supported
the
front
of
the
wharf
along
one
side
wall
for
its
whole
length
was
nailed
a
series
of
horizontal
laths
twelve
inches
apart
what
their
purpose
was
he
did
not
know
but
he
saw
that
they
made
a
ladder
twenty
feet
wide
by
which
a
man
could
work
his
way
from
the
passage
to
the
end
wall
and
reach
the
water
at
any
height
of
the
tide
above
this
ladder
was
an
object
which
at
first
puzzled
the
inspector
then
as
he
realized
its
object
it
became
highly
illuminating
on
a
couple
of
brackets
secured
to
the
wall
lay
a
pipe
of
thin
steel
covered
with
thick
black
baize
and
some
sixteen
feet
long
by
an
inch
in
diameter
through
it
ran
the
light
copper
pipe
which
was
connected
at
its
other
end
to
the
pump
at
the
end
of
the
passage
this
pipe
had
several
joints
like
those
of
a
gas
bracket
and
was
folded
on
itself
the
inspector
stepped
on
to
the
ladder
and
worked
his
way
across
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
steel
pipe
close
by
the
end
wall
the
copper
pipe
protruded
and
ended
in
a
filling
like
the
half
of
a
union
as
willis
gazed
he
suddenly
grasped
its
significance
the
side
of
the
girondin
he
thought
would
lie
not
more
than
ten
feet
from
where
he
was
standing
if
at
night
someone
from
within
the
cellar
were
to
push
the
end
of
the
steel
tube
out
through
one
of
the
spaces
between
the
horizontal
timbers
of
the
end
wall
it
could
be
inserted
into
a
porthole
supposing
one
were
just
opposite
the
concertina
joints
would
make
it
flexible
and
allow
it
to
extend
and
the
baize
covering
would
prevent
its
being
heard
should
it
inadvertently
strike
the
side
of
the
ship
the
union
on
the
copper
tube
could
then
be
fixed
to
some
receptacle
on
board
the
brandy
being
pumped
from
the
ship
to
the
tun
and
no
outsider
could
possibly
be
any
the
wiser
given
a
dark
night
and
careful
operators
the
whole
thing
would
be
carried
out
invisibly
and
in
absolute
silence
now
willis
saw
the
object
of
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
front
of
the
wharf
it
was
necessary
to
have
two
lines
of
piles
so
that
the
deck
between
might
overshadow
and
screen
from
view
the
openings
between
the
horizontal
beams
at
the
front
of
the
cellar
he
stood
marvelling
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
plan
no
wonder
hilliard
and
merriman
had
been
baffled
but
if
he
were
to
finish
his
investigations
he
must
no
longer
delay
he
worked
back
across
the
side
of
the
cellar
regained
the
passage
and
returned
to
the
then
turning
into
the
other
passage
he
began
to
walk
as
quickly
as
possible
along
it
the
tunnel
was
barely
four
feet
high
by
three
wide
and
he
found
progress
very
tiring
after
a
slight
curve
at
the
mouth
it
ran
straight
and
almost
dead
level
its
construction
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
cellar
longitudinal
timber
lining
supported
behind
verticals
and
lintels
spaced
about
six
feet
apart
when
he
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
it
curved
sharply
to
the
left
ran
heavily
timbered
for
some
thirty
yards
in
the
new
direction
and
then
swung
round
to
the
right
again
i
suppose
the
railway
crosses
here
willis
thought
as
he
passed
painfully
round
the
bends
the
sweat
stood
in
drops
on
his
forehead
when
he
reached
the
end
and
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
realized
he
could
once
more
stand
upright
and
stretch
his
cramped
back
he
found
himself
in
another
cellar
this
time
about
six
feet
by
twelve
the
tramway
ran
along
it
stopping
at
the
end
wall
the
place
was
otherwise
empty
save
for
a
wooden
grating
or
with
a
hinged
lid
which
was
fixed
between
the
rails
near
the
entrance
the
telephone
wires
which
had
followed
the
tunnel
all
the
way
here
vanished
into
the
roof
willis
concluded
he
must
be
standing
beneath
some
part
of
the
distillery
and
a
very
little
thought
was
required
to
make
clear
to
him
the
raison
of
what
he
saw
he
pictured
the
kegs
being
pushed
under
the
tap
of
the
large
tun
in
the
and
filled
with
brandy
pumped
in
from
the
girondin
in
imagination
he
saw
benson
pushing
his
loaded
trucks
through
the
tunnel
a
much
easier
thing
to
do
than
to
walk
without
something
to
step
over
stopping
them
one
by
one
over
the
grating
and
emptying
the
contents
therein
no
doubt
that
grating
was
connected
to
some
vat
or
tun
buried
still
deeper
beneath
the
distillery
in
which
the
brandy
mingled
with
the
other
brandy
brought
there
by
more
legitimate
means
and
which
was
sold
without
documentary
evidence
of
its
surprising
increase
in
bulk
it
was
probable
thought
willis
that
some
secret
door
must
connect
the
chamber
in
which
he
stood
with
the
distillery
but
a
careful
search
revealed
no
trace
of
any
opening
and
he
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
none
existed
accordingly
he
turned
and
began
to
retrace
his
steps
through
the
tunnel
the
walk
back
seemed
even
longer
and
more
irksome
than
his
first
transit
and
he
stopped
here
and
there
and
knelt
down
in
order
to
straighten
his
aching
back
as
he
advanced
the
booming
sound
of
the
waves
which
had
died
down
to
a
faint
murmur
at
the
distillery
grew
louder
and
louder
at
last
he
reached
the
and
was
just
about
to
step
out
of
the
tunnel
when
his
eye
caught
the
flicker
of
a
light
at
the
top
of
the
someone
was
coming
down
willis
instantly
snapped
off
his
own
light
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
stood
transfixed
while
his
heart
thumped
and
his
hand
slid
round
to
his
revolver
pocket
breathlessly
he
watched
a
pair
of
legs
step
on
to
the
ladder
and
begin
to
descend
the
steps
like
a
flash
he
realized
what
he
must
do
if
this
was
benson
coming
to
take
up
stuff
to
remain
in
the
tunnel
meant
certain
discovery
but
if
only
he
could
reach
the
passage
under
the
wharf
he
might
be
safe
there
was
nothing
to
bring
benson
into
it
but
to
cross
the
cellar
he
must
pass
within
two
feet
of
the
ladder
and
the
man
was
down
for
a
moment
it
looked
quite
hopeless
then
unexpectedly
he
got
his
chance
the
man
stopped
to
lock
the
wardrobe
door
when
he
had
finished
willis
was
already
across
the
cellar
and
hurrying
down
the
other
passage
fortunately
the
noise
of
the
waves
drowned
all
other
sounds
by
the
time
the
unknown
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
willis
had
stepped
on
to
the
cross
laths
and
was
descending
by
them
in
a
moment
he
was
below
the
passage
level
he
intended
should
the
other
approach
to
hide
beneath
the
water
in
the
hope
that
in
the
darkness
his
head
would
not
be
seen
but
the
light
remained
in
the
cellar
and
willis
raised
himself
and
cautiously
peeped
down
the
passage
then
he
began
to
congratulate
himself
on
what
he
had
just
been
considering
his
misfortune
for
watching
there
in
the
darkness
he
saw
benson
carry
out
the
very
operations
he
had
imagined
were
performed
the
manager
wheeled
the
kegs
one
by
one
beneath
the
great
barrel
filled
them
from
the
tap
and
then
setting
his
lamp
on
the
last
of
the
three
pushed
them
before
him
down
the
tunnel
towards
the
distillery
inspector
willis
waited
until
he
judged
the
other
would
be
out
of
sight
then
left
his
and
cautiously
returned
to
the
the
gauge
now
showed
gallons
and
he
noted
that
gallons
was
put
up
per
trip
he
rapidly
ascended
the
steps
passed
out
through
the
wardrobe
and
regained
the
bedroom
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
once
more
out
on
the
railway
he
had
glanced
at
his
watch
in
the
building
and
found
that
it
was
but
little
after
ten
benson
must
therefore
have
returned
by
an
earlier
train
than
usual
again
the
inspector
congratulated
himself
that
events
had
turned
out
as
they
had
for
though
he
would
have
had
no
fear
of
his
personal
safety
had
he
been
seen
premature
discovery
might
have
allowed
the
other
members
of
the
gang
to
escape
the
last
train
for
hull
having
left
he
started
to
walk
the
six
miles
to
the
city
the
weather
had
still
further
changed
for
the
worse
and
now
half
a
gale
of
wind
whirled
round
him
in
a
pandemonium
of
sound
and
blew
blinding
squalls
of
rain
into
his
eyes
in
a
few
moments
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
and
the
buffeting
of
the
wind
made
his
progress
slow
but
he
struggled
on
too
well
pleased
by
the
success
of
his
evening
work
to
mind
the
discomfort
and
as
he
considered
the
affair
on
the
following
morning
he
felt
even
more
satisfied
he
had
indeed
done
well
not
only
had
he
completed
what
he
set
out
to
do
to
discover
the
murderer
of
coburn
but
he
had
accomplished
vastly
more
he
had
brought
to
light
one
of
the
greatest
smuggling
conspiracies
of
modern
times
it
was
true
he
had
not
followed
up
and
completed
the
case
against
the
syndicate
but
this
was
not
his
business
smuggling
was
not
dealt
with
by
scotland
yard
it
was
a
matter
for
the
customs
department
but
if
only
it
had
been
forged
notes
he
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
thought
of
the
kudos
which
might
have
been
his
but
when
he
had
gone
so
far
he
thought
he
might
as
well
make
certain
that
the
brandy
was
discharged
as
he
imagined
he
calculated
that
the
girondin
would
reach
ferriby
on
the
following
day
and
he
determined
to
see
the
operation
carried
out
he
followed
the
plan
of
hilliard
and
merriman
to
the
extent
of
hiring
a
boat
in
hull
and
sculling
gently
down
towards
the
wharf
as
dusk
fell
he
had
kept
a
watch
on
the
river
all
day
without
seeing
the
motor
ship
go
up
but
now
she
passed
him
a
couple
of
miles
above
the
city
he
turned
inshore
when
he
saw
her
coming
lest
captain
beamish
binoculars
might
reveal
to
him
a
familiar
countenance
he
pulled
easily
timing
himself
to
arrive
at
the
wharf
as
soon
as
possible
after
dark
the
evening
was
dry
but
the
wind
still
blew
cold
and
raw
though
not
nearly
so
strongly
as
on
the
night
of
his
walk
there
were
a
couple
of
lights
on
the
girondin
and
he
steered
by
these
till
the
dark
mass
of
her
counter
looming
up
out
of
the
night
cut
them
off
slipping
round
her
stern
as
hilliard
had
done
in
the
river
lesque
he
unshipped
his
oars
and
guided
the
boat
by
his
hands
into
the
space
between
the
two
rows
of
piles
fronting
the
wharf
as
he
floated
gently
forward
he
felt
between
the
horizontal
props
which
held
back
the
filling
until
he
came
to
a
vacant
space
then
knowing
he
was
opposite
the
cellar
he
slid
the
boat
back
a
few
feet
tied
her
up
and
settled
down
to
wait
though
sheltered
from
the
wind
by
the
hull
it
was
cold
and
damp
under
the
wharf
the
waves
were
lapping
among
the
timbers
and
the
boat
moved
uneasily
at
the
end
of
her
short
painter
the
darkness
was
absolute
an
inky
blackness
unrelieved
by
any
point
of
light
willis
realized
that
waiting
would
soon
become
irksome
but
it
was
not
so
very
long
before
the
work
began
he
had
been
there
he
estimated
a
couple
of
hours
when
he
saw
not
ten
feet
away
a
dim
circle
of
light
suddenly
appear
on
the
girondin
side
someone
had
turned
on
a
faint
light
in
a
cabin
whose
open
porthole
was
immediately
opposite
the
cellar
presently
willis
watching
breathlessly
saw
what
he
believed
was
the
steel
pipe
impinge
on
and
enter
the
illuminated
ring
it
remained
projecting
into
the
porthole
for
some
forty
minutes
was
as
silently
withdrawn
the
porthole
was
closed
a
curtain
drawn
across
it
and
the
light
turned
up
within
the
brandy
had
been
discharged
the
thing
had
been
done
inaudibly
and
invisibly
to
anyone
on
either
wharf
or
ship
marvelling
once
more
at
the
excellence
and
secrecy
of
the
plan
willis
gently
pushed
his
boat
out
from
among
the
piles
and
rowed
back
down
the
river
to
hull
there
he
tied
the
boat
up
and
returning
to
his
hotel
was
soon
fast
asleep
in
spite
of
his
delight
at
the
discovery
he
could
not
but
realize
that
much
still
remained
to
be
done
though
he
had
learned
how
the
syndicate
was
making
its
money
he
had
not
obtained
any
evidence
of
the
complicity
of
its
members
in
the
murder
of
coburn
who
in
addition
to
archer
could
be
involved
there
were
of
course
beamish
bulla
benson
and
henri
there
was
also
a
man
morton
whose
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
had
not
yet
been
ascertained
he
willis
realized
must
be
found
and
identified
but
were
these
all
he
doubted
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
smuggling
system
required
more
helpers
than
these
he
now
understood
how
the
brandy
was
got
from
the
ship
to
the
distillery
and
he
presumed
it
was
loaded
at
the
clearing
in
the
same
manner
being
brought
there
in
some
unknown
way
by
the
motor
lorries
but
there
were
two
parts
of
the
plan
of
which
nothing
was
yet
known
firstly
where
was
the
brandy
obtained
from
originally
and
secondly
how
was
it
distributed
from
the
distillery
it
seemed
to
willis
that
each
of
these
operations
would
require
additional
accomplices
and
if
so
these
persons
might
also
have
been
implicated
in
coburn
death
he
thought
over
the
thing
for
three
solid
hours
before
coming
to
a
decision
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
determined
to
return
to
london
and
if
his
chief
approved
lay
the
whole
facts
before
the
customs
departments
of
both
england
and
france
asking
them
to
investigate
the
matter
in
their
respective
countries
in
the
meantime
he
would
concentrate
on
the
question
of
complicity
in
the
murder
he
left
hull
by
an
afternoon
train
and
that
night
was
in
london
chapter
archer
plants
stuff
willis
chief
at
the
yard
was
not
a
little
impressed
by
his
subordinate
story
he
congratulated
the
inspector
on
his
discovery
commended
him
for
his
restraint
in
withholding
action
against
archer
until
he
had
identified
his
accomplices
and
approved
his
proposals
for
the
further
conduct
of
the
case
fortified
by
this
somewhat
unexpected
approbation
willis
betook
himself
forthwith
to
the
headquarters
of
the
customs
department
and
asked
to
see
hilliard
the
two
men
were
already
acquainted
as
has
been
stated
the
inspector
had
early
called
at
hilliard
rooms
and
learned
all
that
the
other
could
tell
him
of
the
case
but
for
prudential
reasons
they
had
not
met
since
hilliard
was
tremendously
excited
by
the
inspector
news
and
eagerly
arranged
the
interview
with
his
chief
which
willis
sought
the
great
man
was
not
engaged
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
others
were
shown
into
his
presence
we
are
here
sir
willis
began
when
the
necessary
introductions
had
been
made
to
tell
you
jointly
a
very
remarkable
story
hilliard
would
doubtless
have
told
you
his
part
long
before
this
had
i
not
specially
asked
him
not
to
now
sir
the
time
has
come
to
put
the
facts
before
you
perhaps
as
hilliard
story
comes
before
mine
in
point
of
time
he
should
hilliard
thereupon
began
he
told
of
merriman
story
in
the
club
his
own
idea
of
smuggling
based
on
the
absence
of
return
cargoes
his
proposition
to
merriman
their
trip
to
france
and
what
they
learned
at
the
clearing
then
he
described
their
visit
to
hull
their
observations
at
the
ferriby
wharf
the
experiment
carried
out
with
the
help
of
leatham
and
finally
what
merriman
had
told
him
of
his
second
visit
to
bordeaux
willis
next
took
up
the
tale
and
described
the
murder
of
coburn
his
inquiries
thereinto
and
the
identification
of
the
assassin
and
his
subsequent
discoveries
at
ferriby
ending
up
by
stating
the
problem
which
still
confronted
him
and
expressing
the
hope
that
the
chief
in
dealing
with
the
smuggling
conspiracy
would
with
him
in
connection
with
the
murder
the
latter
had
listened
with
an
expression
of
amazement
which
towards
the
end
of
the
inspector
statement
changed
to
one
of
the
liveliest
satisfaction
he
gracefully
congratulated
both
men
on
their
achievements
and
expressed
his
gratification
at
what
had
been
discovered
and
his
desire
to
to
the
full
with
the
inspector
in
the
settling
up
of
the
case
the
three
men
then
turned
to
details
to
hilliard
bitter
disappointment
it
was
ruled
that
owing
to
his
being
known
to
at
least
three
members
of
the
gang
he
could
take
no
part
in
the
final
scenes
and
he
had
to
be
content
with
the
honor
of
as
it
were
a
seat
on
the
council
of
war
for
nearly
an
hour
they
deliberated
at
the
end
of
which
time
it
had
been
decided
that
stopford
hunt
one
of
the
customs
department
most
skillful
investigators
should
proceed
to
hull
and
tackle
the
question
of
the
distribution
of
the
brandy
willis
was
to
go
to
paris
interest
the
french
authorities
in
the
bordeaux
end
of
the
affair
and
then
join
hunt
in
hull
stopford
hunt
was
an
man
of
about
forty
all
his
characteristics
might
be
described
as
being
of
medium
quality
he
was
five
feet
nine
in
height
his
brown
hair
was
neither
fair
nor
dark
his
dress
suggested
neither
poverty
nor
opulence
and
his
features
were
of
the
type
known
as
ordinary
in
a
word
he
was
not
one
whose
appearance
would
provoke
a
second
glance
or
who
would
be
credited
with
taking
an
important
part
in
anything
that
might
be
in
progress
but
for
his
job
these
very
peculiarities
were
among
his
chief
assets
when
he
hung
about
in
an
aimless
loafing
way
as
he
very
often
did
he
was
overlooked
by
those
whose
actions
he
was
so
discreetly
watching
and
where
mere
loafing
would
look
suspicious
he
had
the
inestimable
gift
of
being
able
to
waste
time
in
an
afraid
and
preoccupied
manner
that
night
willis
crossed
to
paris
and
next
day
he
told
his
story
to
the
polite
chief
of
the
french
excise
max
was
almost
as
interested
as
his
english
confrere
and
readily
promised
to
have
the
french
end
of
the
affair
investigated
that
same
evening
the
inspector
left
for
london
going
on
in
the
morning
to
hull
he
found
hunt
a
shrewd
and
capable
man
of
the
world
as
well
as
a
pleasant
and
interesting
companion
they
had
engaged
a
private
at
their
hotel
and
after
dinner
they
retired
thither
to
discuss
their
plan
of
campaign
i
wish
said
willis
when
they
had
talked
for
some
moments
that
you
would
tell
me
something
about
how
this
liquor
distribution
business
is
worked
it
outside
my
job
and
i
not
clear
on
the
details
if
i
understood
i
could
perhaps
help
you
hunt
nodded
and
drew
slowly
at
his
pipe
the
principle
of
the
thing
he
answered
is
simple
enough
though
in
detail
it
becomes
a
bit
complicated
the
first
thing
we
have
to
remember
is
that
in
this
case
we
dealing
not
with
distillers
but
with
rectifiers
though
in
loose
popular
phraseology
both
businesses
are
classed
under
the
term
in
reality
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
them
distillers
actually
produce
the
spirit
in
their
buildings
rectifiers
do
not
rectifiers
import
the
spirit
produced
by
distillers
and
refine
or
prepare
it
for
various
specified
purposes
the
check
required
by
the
excise
authorities
is
therefore
different
in
each
case
with
rectifiers
it
is
only
necessary
to
measure
the
stuff
that
goes
into
and
comes
out
of
the
works
making
due
allowance
for
variation
during
treatment
these
two
figures
will
balance
if
all
is
willis
nodded
and
hunt
resumed
now
the
essence
of
all
fraud
is
that
more
stuff
goes
out
of
the
works
than
is
shown
on
the
returns
that
is
of
course
another
way
of
saying
that
stuff
is
sold
upon
which
duty
has
not
been
paid
in
the
case
of
a
rectifying
house
where
there
is
no
illicit
still
more
also
comes
in
than
is
shown
in
the
present
instance
you
yourself
have
shown
how
the
extra
brandy
enters
our
job
is
to
find
out
how
it
that
part
of
it
is
clear
enough
anyway
willis
said
with
a
smile
but
brandy
smuggling
is
not
new
there
must
surely
be
recognized
ways
of
evading
the
law
quite
there
are
but
to
follow
them
you
must
understand
how
the
output
is
measured
for
every
consignment
of
stuff
that
leaves
the
works
a
permit
or
certificate
is
issued
and
handed
to
the
carrier
who
removes
it
this
is
a
kind
of
and
of
course
a
block
is
kept
for
the
inspection
of
the
surveying
officer
it
contains
a
note
of
the
quantity
of
stuff
date
and
hour
of
starting
consignee
name
and
other
information
and
it
is
the
authority
for
the
carrier
to
have
the
liquor
in
his
possession
an
excise
officer
may
stop
and
examine
any
dray
or
lorry
carrying
liquor
or
railway
wagon
and
the
driver
or
other
official
must
produce
his
certificate
so
that
his
load
may
be
checked
by
it
all
such
what
i
may
call
surprise
examinations
together
with
the
signature
of
the
officer
making
them
are
recorded
on
the
back
of
the
certificate
when
the
stuff
is
delivered
the
certificate
is
handed
over
with
it
to
the
consignee
he
signs
it
on
receipt
it
then
becomes
his
authority
for
having
the
stuff
on
his
premises
and
he
must
keep
it
for
the
excise
officer
inspection
do
you
follow
me
so
far
the
fraud
then
consists
in
getting
more
liquor
away
from
the
works
than
is
shown
on
the
certificates
and
i
must
confess
it
is
not
easy
the
commonest
method
i
should
think
is
to
fill
the
kegs
or
receptacles
slightly
fuller
than
the
certificate
shows
this
is
sometimes
done
simply
by
putting
extra
stuff
in
the
ordinary
kegs
it
is
argued
that
an
excise
officer
can
not
by
his
eye
tell
a
difference
of
five
or
six
per
cent
that
for
example
gallons
might
be
supplied
on
a
gallon
certificate
without
anyone
being
much
the
wiser
variants
of
this
method
are
to
use
slightly
larger
kegs
or
more
subtly
to
use
the
normal
sized
kegs
of
which
the
wood
at
the
ends
has
been
thinned
down
and
which
therefore
when
filled
to
the
same
level
hold
more
while
showing
the
same
measure
with
a
dipping
rod
but
all
these
methods
are
risky
on
the
suspicion
the
contents
of
the
kegs
are
measured
and
the
fraud
becomes
willis
much
interested
bent
forward
eagerly
as
the
other
after
a
pause
to
relight
his
pipe
continued
another
common
method
is
to
send
out
liquor
secretly
without
a
permit
at
all
this
may
be
done
at
night
or
the
stuff
may
go
through
an
underground
pipe
or
be
hidden
in
innocent
looking
articles
such
as
suitcases
or
petrol
tins
the
pipe
is
the
best
scheme
from
the
operator
point
of
view
and
one
may
remain
undiscovered
for
months
but
the
difficulty
usually
is
to
lay
it
in
the
first
instance
a
third
method
can
be
used
only
in
the
case
of
rectifiers
and
it
illustrates
one
of
the
differences
between
rectifiers
and
distillers
every
permit
for
the
removal
of
liquor
from
a
distillery
must
be
issued
by
the
excise
surveyor
of
the
district
whereas
rectifiers
can
issue
their
own
certificates
therefore
in
the
case
of
rectifiers
there
is
the
possibility
of
the
issuing
of
forged
or
fraudulent
certificates
of
course
this
is
not
so
easy
as
it
sounds
the
certificates
are
supplied
in
books
of
two
hundred
by
the
excise
authorities
and
the
blocks
must
be
kept
available
for
the
supervisor
scrutiny
any
certificates
can
be
obtained
from
the
receivers
of
the
spirit
and
compared
with
the
blocks
forged
permits
are
very
risky
things
to
work
with
as
all
genuine
ones
bear
the
government
watermark
which
is
not
easy
to
reproduce
in
fact
i
may
say
about
this
whole
question
of
liquor
distribution
generally
that
fraud
has
been
made
so
difficult
that
the
only
hope
of
those
committing
it
is
to
avoid
arousing
suspicion
once
suspicion
is
aroused
discovery
follows
almost
as
a
matter
of
that
hopeful
for
us
willis
smiled
yes
the
other
answered
though
i
fancy
this
case
will
be
more
difficult
than
most
there
is
another
point
to
be
taken
into
consideration
which
i
have
not
mentioned
and
that
is
how
the
perpetrators
of
the
frauds
are
going
to
get
their
money
in
the
last
resort
it
can
only
come
in
from
the
public
over
the
counters
of
the
licensed
premises
which
sell
the
smuggled
spirits
but
just
as
the
smuggled
liquor
can
not
be
put
through
the
books
of
the
house
selling
it
so
the
money
received
for
it
can
not
be
entered
either
this
means
that
someone
in
authority
in
each
licensed
house
must
be
involved
it
also
carries
with
it
a
suggestion
though
only
a
suggestion
the
houses
in
question
are
tied
houses
the
director
of
a
distillery
company
would
have
more
hold
on
the
manager
of
their
own
tied
houses
than
over
an
again
willis
nodded
without
replying
and
hunt
went
on
now
it
happens
that
these
ackroyd
holt
people
own
some
very
large
licensed
houses
in
hull
and
it
is
to
them
i
imagine
that
we
should
first
direct
our
how
do
you
propose
to
begin
i
think
we
must
first
find
out
how
the
ferriby
liquor
is
sent
to
these
houses
by
the
way
you
probably
know
that
already
you
watched
the
distillery
during
working
hours
did
you
the
inspector
admitted
it
did
you
see
any
lorries
any
number
large
blue
machines
i
noticed
them
going
and
coming
in
the
hull
direction
loaded
up
with
hunt
seemed
pleased
good
he
commented
that
a
beginning
anyway
our
next
step
must
be
to
make
sure
that
all
these
lorries
carry
certificates
we
had
better
begin
willis
did
not
quite
see
how
the
business
was
to
be
done
but
he
forbore
to
ask
questions
agreeing
to
fall
in
with
his
companion
arrangements
these
arrangements
involved
the
departure
from
their
hotel
by
taxi
at
six
the
next
morning
it
was
not
fully
light
as
they
whirled
out
along
the
ferriby
road
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
all
the
indications
pointed
to
a
fine
day
they
dismounted
at
the
end
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
works
and
struck
off
across
the
fields
finally
taking
up
their
position
behind
the
same
thick
hedge
from
which
willis
had
previously
kept
watch
they
spent
the
whole
of
that
day
as
well
as
of
the
next
two
in
their
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
had
a
complete
list
of
all
lorries
that
entered
or
left
the
establishment
during
that
period
no
vehicles
other
than
blue
lorries
appeared
and
hunt
expressed
himself
as
satisfied
that
if
the
smuggled
brandy
was
not
carried
by
them
it
must
go
either
by
rail
or
at
night
we
can
go
into
those
other
contingencies
later
if
necessary
he
said
but
on
the
face
of
it
i
am
inclined
to
back
the
lorries
they
supply
the
tied
houses
in
hull
which
would
seem
the
obvious
places
for
the
brandy
to
go
and
besides
railway
transit
is
too
well
looked
after
to
attract
the
gang
i
think
we
follow
this
lorry
business
through
first
on
i
suppose
you
compare
the
certificate
blocks
with
the
list
i
made
willis
asked
of
course
that
will
show
if
all
carry
certificates
but
i
do
want
to
do
that
yet
before
alarming
them
i
want
to
examine
the
contents
of
a
few
of
the
lorries
i
think
we
might
do
that
the
next
morning
therefore
the
two
detectives
again
engaged
a
taxi
and
ran
out
along
the
ferriby
road
until
they
met
a
large
blue
lorry
loaded
with
barrels
and
bearing
on
its
side
the
legend
ackroyd
holt
ltd
licensed
when
it
had
lumbered
past
on
its
way
to
the
city
hunt
called
to
the
driver
and
ordered
him
to
follow
it
the
chase
led
to
the
heart
of
the
town
ending
in
a
street
which
ran
parallel
to
the
humber
dock
there
the
big
machine
turned
in
to
an
entry
the
anchor
bar
hunt
said
in
satisfied
tones
we
in
luck
one
of
the
largest
licensed
houses
in
he
jumped
out
and
disappeared
after
the
lorry
willis
following
the
vehicle
had
stopped
in
a
yard
at
the
back
of
the
great
public
house
where
were
more
barrels
than
the
inspector
ever
remembered
having
seen
together
while
the
smell
of
various
liquors
hung
heavy
in
the
air
hunt
having
shown
his
credentials
demanded
the
certificate
for
the
consignment
this
was
immediately
produced
by
the
driver
scrutinized
and
found
in
order
hunt
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
consignment
itself
and
willis
was
lost
in
admiration
at
the
rapidity
as
well
as
the
thoroughness
of
his
inspection
he
tested
the
nature
of
the
various
liquids
measured
their
receptacles
took
drippings
in
each
cask
and
otherwise
satisfied
himself
as
to
the
quality
and
quantity
finally
he
had
a
look
over
the
lorry
then
expressing
himself
satisfied
he
endorsed
the
certificate
and
with
a
few
civil
words
to
the
men
in
charge
the
two
detectives
took
their
leave
that
all
square
anyway
hunt
remarked
as
they
reentered
their
taxi
i
suppose
we
may
go
and
do
the
same
thing
they
did
three
times
more
on
that
day
and
four
times
on
the
next
day
they
followed
ackroyd
holt
lorries
in
every
instance
with
the
same
result
all
eight
consignments
were
examined
with
the
utmost
care
and
all
were
found
to
be
accurately
described
on
the
accompanying
certificate
the
certificates
themselves
were
obviously
genuine
and
everything
about
them
so
far
as
hunt
could
see
was
in
order
does
look
as
if
we
are
going
to
get
it
that
way
he
commented
as
late
that
second
evening
they
sat
once
more
discussing
matters
in
their
private
do
you
think
you
have
frightened
them
into
honesty
by
our
persistence
willis
queried
no
doubt
the
other
returned
but
that
could
apply
to
the
first
few
trips
they
could
possibly
have
foretold
that
we
should
examine
those
consignments
yesterday
and
today
i
expect
they
thought
their
visitation
was
over
but
we
have
worked
it
as
far
as
it
will
go
we
shall
have
to
change
our
the
inspector
looked
his
question
and
hunt
continued
i
think
tomorrow
i
had
better
go
out
to
the
works
and
have
a
look
over
these
certificate
blocks
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
come
archer
has
seen
you
in
that
hotel
lounge
and
at
all
events
he
has
your
i
shall
not
go
willis
decided
see
you
when
you
get
hunt
after
showing
his
credentials
was
received
with
civility
at
ackroyd
holt
when
he
had
completed
the
usual
examination
of
their
various
apparatus
he
asked
for
certain
books
he
took
them
to
a
desk
and
sitting
down
began
to
study
the
certificate
blocks
his
first
care
was
to
compare
the
list
of
outward
lorries
which
he
and
willis
had
made
with
the
blocks
for
the
same
period
a
short
investigation
convinced
him
that
here
also
everything
was
in
order
there
was
a
certificate
for
every
lorry
which
had
passed
out
and
not
only
so
but
the
number
of
the
lorry
the
day
and
hour
at
which
it
left
and
the
load
were
all
correct
so
far
as
his
observations
had
enabled
him
to
check
them
it
was
clear
that
here
also
he
had
drawn
blank
and
for
the
fiftieth
time
he
wondered
with
a
sort
of
rueful
admiration
how
the
fraud
was
being
worked
he
was
idly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
blocks
gazing
vacantly
at
the
lines
of
writing
while
he
pondered
his
problem
when
his
attention
was
attracted
to
a
slight
difference
of
color
in
the
ink
of
an
entry
on
one
of
the
blocks
the
consignment
was
a
mixed
one
containing
different
kinds
of
spirituous
liquors
the
lowest
entry
was
for
three
gallon
kegs
of
french
brandy
this
entry
was
slightly
paler
than
the
remain
order
at
first
hunt
did
not
give
the
matter
serious
thought
the
page
had
evidently
been
blotted
while
the
ink
was
wet
and
the
lower
items
should
therefore
naturally
be
the
fainter
but
as
he
looked
more
closely
he
saw
that
this
explanation
would
not
quite
meet
the
case
it
was
true
that
the
lower
two
or
three
items
above
that
of
the
brandy
grew
gradually
paler
in
proportion
to
their
position
down
the
sheet
and
to
this
rule
archer
signature
at
the
bottom
was
no
exception
in
these
hunt
could
trace
the
gradual
fading
of
color
due
to
the
use
of
blotting
paper
but
he
now
saw
that
this
did
not
apply
to
the
brandy
entry
it
was
the
palest
of
all
paler
even
than
archer
name
which
was
below
it
he
sat
staring
at
the
sheet
whistling
softly
through
his
teeth
and
with
his
brow
puckered
into
a
frown
as
he
wondered
whether
the
obvious
suggestion
that
the
brandy
item
had
been
added
after
the
sheet
had
been
completed
was
a
sound
deduction
he
could
think
of
no
other
explanation
but
he
was
loath
to
form
a
definite
opinion
on
such
slight
evidence
he
turned
back
through
the
blocks
to
see
if
they
contained
other
similar
instances
and
as
he
did
so
his
interest
grew
quite
a
number
of
the
pages
referring
to
mixed
consignment
had
for
their
last
item
kegs
of
french
brandy
he
scrutinized
these
entries
with
the
utmost
care
a
few
seemed
normal
enough
but
others
showed
indications
which
strengthened
his
suspicions
in
three
more
the
ink
was
undoubtedly
paler
than
the
remainder
of
the
sheet
in
five
it
was
darker
while
in
several
others
the
handwriting
appeared
slightly
different
more
upright
more
sloping
more
heavily
or
more
lightly
leaned
on
when
hunt
had
examined
all
the
instances
he
could
find
stretching
over
a
period
of
three
months
he
was
convinced
that
his
deduction
was
correct
the
brandy
items
had
been
written
at
a
different
time
from
the
remainder
and
this
could
only
mean
that
they
had
been
added
after
the
certificate
was
complete
his
interest
at
last
keenly
aroused
he
began
to
make
an
analysis
of
the
blocks
in
question
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
other
peculiarity
common
to
them
which
might
indicate
the
direction
in
which
the
solution
might
lie
and
first
as
to
the
consignees
ackroyd
holt
evidently
supplied
a
very
large
number
of
licensed
houses
but
of
these
the
names
of
only
five
appeared
on
the
doubtful
blocks
but
these
five
were
confined
to
houses
in
hull
and
each
was
a
large
and
important
concern
so
far
so
good
thought
hunt
with
satisfaction
if
they
not
planting
their
stuff
in
those
five
houses
i
a
dutchman
he
turned
back
to
the
blocks
and
once
again
went
through
them
this
time
he
made
an
even
more
suggestive
discovery
only
one
was
concerned
in
the
transport
of
the
doubtful
consignments
all
the
lorries
in
question
had
been
in
charge
of
a
driver
called
charles
fox
hunt
remembered
the
man
he
had
driven
three
of
the
eight
lorries
hunt
himself
had
examined
and
he
had
been
most
civil
when
stopped
giving
the
investigator
all
possible
assistance
in
making
his
inspection
nor
had
he
at
any
time
betrayed
embarrassment
and
now
it
seemed
not
improbable
that
this
same
man
was
one
of
those
concerned
in
the
fraud
hunt
applied
himself
once
again
to
a
study
of
the
blocks
and
then
he
made
a
third
discovery
which
though
he
could
not
at
first
see
its
drift
struck
him
nevertheless
as
being
of
importance
he
found
that
the
faked
block
was
always
one
of
a
pair
within
a
few
pages
either
in
front
of
or
behind
it
was
another
block
containing
particulars
of
a
similar
consignment
identical
in
fact
except
that
the
brandy
item
was
missing
hunt
was
puzzled
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
fraud
he
could
not
but
believe
but
he
could
form
no
idea
as
to
how
it
was
worked
if
he
were
right
so
far
the
blocks
had
been
made
out
in
facsimile
in
the
first
instance
and
later
the
brandy
item
had
been
added
to
one
of
each
pair
why
he
could
not
guess
he
continued
his
examination
and
soon
another
interesting
fact
became
apparent
though
consignments
left
the
works
at
all
hours
of
the
day
those
referred
to
by
the
first
one
of
each
between
the
hours
of
four
and
five
further
the
number
of
minutes
past
one
and
past
four
were
always
identical
on
each
pair
that
showed
the
brandy
item
was
nearly
always
the
later
of
the
two
but
occasionally
the
stuff
had
gone
with
the
one
trip
hunt
sat
in
the
small
office
of
which
he
had
been
given
undisturbed
possession
pondering
over
his
problem
and
trying
to
marshal
the
facts
that
he
had
learned
in
such
a
way
as
to
extract
their
inner
meaning
as
far
as
he
could
follow
them
they
seemed
to
show
that
three
times
each
day
driver
charles
fox
took
a
lorry
of
various
liquors
into
hull
the
first
trip
was
irregular
that
is
he
left
at
anything
between
and
and
his
objective
extended
over
the
entire
city
the
remaining
two
trips
were
regular
of
these
the
first
always
left
between
one
and
two
and
the
second
the
same
number
of
minutes
past
four
both
were
invariably
to
the
same
one
of
the
five
large
tied
houses
already
mentioned
the
load
of
each
was
always
identical
except
that
one
generally
the
second
had
some
kegs
of
brandy
additional
and
lastly
the
note
of
this
extra
brandy
appeared
always
to
have
been
added
to
the
certificate
after
the
latter
had
been
made
out
hunt
could
make
nothing
of
it
in
the
evening
he
described
his
discoveries
to
willis
and
the
two
men
discussed
the
affair
exhaustively
though
still
without
result
that
night
hunt
could
not
sleep
he
lay
tossing
from
side
to
side
and
racking
his
brains
to
find
a
solution
he
felt
subconsciously
that
it
was
within
his
reach
and
yet
he
could
not
grasp
it
it
was
not
far
from
dawn
when
a
sudden
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
and
he
lay
thrilled
with
excitement
as
he
wondered
if
at
last
he
held
the
clue
to
the
mystery
he
went
over
the
details
in
his
mind
and
the
more
he
thought
over
his
theory
the
more
likely
it
seemed
to
grow
but
how
was
he
to
test
it
daylight
had
come
before
he
saw
his
way
but
at
last
he
was
satisfied
and
at
breakfast
he
told
willis
his
idea
and
asked
his
help
to
carry
out
his
plan
you
not
a
photographer
by
any
chance
he
asked
i
not
but
i
dabble
a
bit
at
good
that
will
save
some
they
called
at
a
photographic
outfitter
and
there
after
making
a
deposit
succeeded
in
hiring
two
kodaks
for
the
day
with
these
and
a
set
of
climbing
irons
they
drove
out
along
the
ferriby
road
arriving
at
the
end
of
the
lane
to
the
works
shortly
after
midday
there
they
dismissed
their
taxi
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
their
actions
became
somewhat
bewildering
to
the
uninitiated
along
one
side
of
the
road
ran
a
wall
bounding
the
plantation
of
a
large
villa
over
this
willis
with
the
help
of
his
friend
clambered
with
some
loose
stones
he
built
himself
a
footing
at
the
back
so
that
he
could
just
look
over
the
top
then
having
focused
his
camera
for
the
middle
of
the
road
he
retired
into
obscurity
behind
his
defences
his
friend
settled
to
his
satisfaction
hunt
buckled
on
the
climbing
irons
and
crossing
the
road
proceeded
to
climb
a
telegraph
pole
which
stood
opposite
the
lane
he
fixed
his
camera
to
the
lower
wires
carefully
avoiding
possible
and
having
focused
it
for
the
center
of
the
road
pulled
a
pair
of
pliers
from
his
pocket
and
endeavored
to
simulate
the
actions
of
a
lineman
at
work
by
the
time
these
preparations
were
complete
it
was
close
on
one
some
later
a
large
blue
lorry
came
in
sight
bearing
down
along
the
lane
presently
hunt
was
able
to
see
that
the
driver
was
fox
he
made
a
prearranged
sign
to
his
accomplice
behind
the
wall
and
the
latter
camera
in
hand
stood
up
and
peeped
over
as
the
big
vehicle
swung
slowly
round
into
the
main
road
both
men
from
their
respective
positions
photographed
it
hunt
indeed
rapidly
changing
the
film
took
a
second
view
as
the
machine
retreated
down
the
road
towards
hull
when
it
was
out
of
sight
hunt
descended
and
with
some
difficulty
climbed
the
wall
to
his
colleague
there
in
the
shade
of
the
thick
belt
of
trees
both
men
lay
down
and
smoked
peacefully
until
nearly
four
then
once
more
they
took
up
their
respective
positions
watched
until
about
half
an
hour
later
the
lorry
again
passed
out
and
photographed
it
precisely
as
before
that
done
they
walked
to
hassle
station
and
took
the
first
train
to
hull
by
dint
of
baksheesh
they
persuaded
the
photographer
to
develop
their
films
there
and
then
and
that
same
evening
they
had
six
prints
as
it
happened
they
turned
out
exceedingly
good
photographs
their
definition
was
excellent
and
each
view
included
the
whole
of
the
lorry
the
friends
found
as
hunt
had
hoped
and
intended
that
owing
to
the
height
from
which
the
views
had
been
taken
each
several
keg
of
the
load
showed
out
distinctly
they
counted
them
each
picture
showed
seventeen
you
see
cried
hunt
triumphantly
the
same
amount
of
stuff
went
out
on
each
load
we
shall
have
them
now
willis
next
day
hunt
returned
to
ferriby
works
ostensibly
to
continue
his
routine
inspection
but
in
three
minutes
he
had
seen
what
he
wanted
taking
the
certificate
book
he
looked
up
the
blocks
of
the
two
consignments
they
had
photographed
and
he
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
his
exultation
as
he
saw
that
what
he
had
suspected
was
indeed
the
fact
the
two
certificates
were
identical
except
that
to
the
second
an
item
of
four
kegs
of
french
brandy
had
been
added
hunt
counted
the
barrels
the
first
certificate
showed
thirteen
and
the
last
seventeen
four
kegs
of
brandy
smuggled
out
under
our
noses
yesterday
he
thought
delightedly
by
jove
but
it
a
clever
trick
now
to
test
the
next
he
made
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
works
and
returning
to
hull
called
at
the
licensed
house
to
which
the
previous
afternoon
consignment
had
been
dispatched
there
he
asked
to
see
the
certificates
of
the
two
trips
on
seeing
his
credentials
these
were
handed
up
without
demur
and
he
withdrew
with
them
to
his
hotel
come
he
cried
to
willis
who
was
reading
in
the
lounge
and
see
the
final
act
in
the
they
retired
to
their
private
room
and
there
hunt
spread
the
two
certificates
on
the
table
both
men
stared
at
them
and
hunt
gave
vent
to
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
i
was
right
he
cried
delightedly
look
here
why
i
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
the
two
certificates
were
an
accurate
copy
of
their
blocks
they
were
dated
correctly
both
bore
fox
name
as
driver
and
both
showed
consignments
of
liquor
identical
except
for
the
additional
four
kegs
of
brandy
on
the
second
there
was
furthermore
no
sign
that
this
had
been
added
after
the
remainder
the
slight
lightening
in
the
color
towards
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
due
to
the
use
of
blotting
paper
was
so
progressive
as
almost
to
prove
the
whole
had
been
written
at
the
same
time
the
first
certificate
was
timed
the
second
and
it
was
to
the
of
this
second
hour
that
hunt
eager
finger
pointed
as
willis
examined
it
he
saw
that
the
lower
strokes
were
fainter
than
the
remainder
further
the
beginning
of
the
horizontal
stroke
did
not
quite
join
the
first
vertical
stroke
you
see
hunt
cried
excitedly
that
figure
is
a
forgery
it
was
originally
a
and
the
two
lower
strokes
have
been
added
to
make
it
a
the
case
is
finished
willis
was
less
enthusiastic
i
not
so
sure
of
that
he
returned
cautiously
i
do
see
light
all
the
way
through
just
go
over
it
again
will
you
why
to
me
it
as
clear
as
daylight
the
other
asserted
impatiently
see
here
archer
decides
let
us
suppose
that
he
will
send
out
four
kegs
or
one
hundred
gallons
of
the
smuggled
brandy
to
the
anchor
bar
what
does
he
do
he
fills
out
certificates
for
two
consignments
each
of
which
contains
an
identical
assortment
of
various
liquors
the
brandy
he
shows
on
one
certificate
only
the
blocks
are
true
copies
of
the
certificates
except
that
the
brandy
is
not
entered
on
either
the
two
blocks
he
times
for
a
quarter
past
one
and
past
four
respectively
but
both
certificates
he
times
for
a
quarter
past
one
he
hands
the
two
certificates
to
fox
then
he
sends
out
on
the
one
lorry
the
amount
of
brandy
shown
on
one
of
the
hunt
paused
and
looked
interrogatively
at
his
friend
then
the
latter
not
replying
he
resumed
you
follow
now
the
position
of
affairs
in
the
office
is
archer
with
his
blocks
correctly
filled
out
as
to
time
but
neither
showing
the
brandy
on
the
one
lorry
is
fox
with
one
hundred
gallons
of
brandy
among
his
load
in
his
pocket
are
the
two
certificates
both
timed
for
one
one
showing
the
brandy
and
the
other
the
inspector
nodded
as
hunt
again
looked
at
him
now
suppose
the
latter
went
on
that
the
one
lorry
gets
through
to
its
destination
unchallenged
and
the
stuff
is
unloaded
the
manager
arranges
that
the
four
kegs
of
brandy
will
disappear
he
takes
over
the
certificate
which
does
not
show
brandy
signs
it
and
the
transaction
is
complete
everything
is
in
order
and
he
has
got
four
kegs
smuggled
good
willis
interjected
on
the
other
hand
suppose
the
one
trip
is
held
up
by
an
exciseman
this
time
fox
produces
the
other
certificate
the
one
which
shows
the
brandy
once
again
everything
is
in
order
and
the
excise
officer
satisfied
it
is
true
that
on
this
occasion
fox
has
been
unable
to
smuggle
out
his
brandy
and
on
that
which
he
carries
duty
must
be
paid
but
this
rare
contingency
will
not
matter
to
him
as
long
as
his
method
of
fraud
remains
seems
very
sound
so
i
think
so
let
us
now
consider
the
four
trip
fox
arrives
back
at
the
works
with
one
of
the
two
certificates
still
in
his
pocket
and
the
make
up
of
his
four
load
depends
on
which
it
is
he
attempts
no
more
smuggling
that
day
if
his
remaining
certificate
shows
brandy
he
carries
brandy
if
not
he
leaves
it
behind
in
either
case
his
certificate
is
in
order
if
an
excise
officer
holds
him
up
that
is
when
he
has
attended
to
one
little
point
he
has
to
add
two
strokes
to
the
of
the
hour
to
make
it
into
a
the
ease
of
doing
this
explains
why
these
two
hours
were
chosen
is
that
all
clear
clear
indeed
except
for
the
one
point
of
how
the
brandy
item
is
added
to
the
correct
obviously
archer
does
that
as
soon
as
he
learns
how
the
first
trip
has
got
on
if
the
brandy
was
smuggled
out
on
the
first
trip
it
means
that
fox
is
holding
the
certificate
for
the
second
and
archer
enters
brandy
on
his
second
block
if
on
the
contrary
fox
has
had
his
first
load
examined
archer
will
make
his
entry
on
the
first
the
scheme
willis
declared
really
means
this
if
archer
wants
to
smuggle
out
one
hundred
gallons
of
brandy
he
has
to
send
out
another
hundred
legitimately
on
the
same
day
if
he
can
manage
to
send
out
two
hundred
altogether
then
one
hundred
will
be
duty
clear
but
in
any
case
he
must
pay
on
one
hundred
that
right
it
works
out
like
it
a
great
scheme
the
only
weak
point
that
i
can
see
is
that
an
excise
officer
who
has
held
up
one
of
the
trips
might
visit
the
works
and
look
at
the
certificate
block
before
archer
gets
it
hunt
nodded
i
thought
of
that
he
said
and
it
can
be
met
quite
easily
i
bet
the
manager
telephones
archer
on
receipt
of
the
stuff
i
am
going
into
that
now
i
shall
have
a
note
kept
at
the
central
of
conversations
to
ferriby
if
archer
does
get
a
message
by
a
certain
time
i
bet
he
assumes
the
plan
has
miscarried
for
that
day
and
fills
in
the
brandy
on
the
first
during
the
next
two
days
hunt
was
able
to
establish
the
truth
of
his
surmise
at
the
same
time
willis
decided
that
his
in
the
work
at
hull
was
no
longer
needed
for
hunt
there
was
still
plenty
to
be
done
he
had
to
get
direct
evidence
against
each
severally
of
the
managers
of
the
five
tied
houses
in
question
as
well
as
to
ascertain
how
and
to
whom
they
were
passing
on
the
stuff
for
that
they
were
receiving
more
brandy
than
could
be
sold
over
their
own
counters
was
unquestionable
but
he
agreed
with
willis
that
these
five
men
were
more
than
likely
in
ignorance
of
the
main
conspiracy
each
having
only
a
private
understanding
with
archer
but
whether
or
not
this
was
so
willis
did
not
believe
he
could
get
any
evidence
that
they
were
implicated
in
the
murder
of
coburn
the
french
end
of
the
affair
he
thought
the
supply
of
the
brandy
in
the
first
instance
was
more
promising
from
this
point
of
view
and
the
next
morning
he
took
an
early
train
to
london
as
a
preliminary
to
starting
work
in
france
chapter
the
bordeaux
lorries
two
days
later
inspector
willis
sat
once
again
in
the
office
of
max
the
head
of
the
french
excise
department
in
paris
the
frenchman
greeted
him
politely
but
without
enthusiasm
ah
monsieur
he
said
you
have
not
received
my
letter
no
i
wrote
to
your
department
it
had
come
sir
when
i
left
willis
returned
but
perhaps
if
it
is
something
i
should
know
you
could
tell
me
the
contents
but
certainly
monsieur
it
is
easily
done
a
thousand
regrets
but
i
fear
my
department
will
not
be
of
much
service
to
no
sir
willis
looked
his
question
i
fear
not
but
i
shall
explain
max
gesticulated
as
he
talked
after
your
last
visit
here
i
send
two
of
my
men
to
bordeaux
they
make
examination
but
at
first
they
see
nothing
suspicious
when
the
girondin
comes
in
they
determine
to
test
your
idea
of
the
brandy
loading
they
go
in
a
boat
to
the
wharf
at
night
they
pull
in
between
the
rows
of
piles
they
find
the
spaces
between
the
tree
trunks
which
you
have
described
they
know
there
must
be
a
cellar
behind
they
hide
close
by
they
see
the
porthole
lighted
up
they
watch
the
pipe
go
in
all
exactly
as
you
have
said
there
can
be
no
doubt
brandy
is
secretly
loaded
at
the
it
seemed
the
likely
thing
sir
willis
commented
ah
but
it
was
good
to
think
of
i
wish
to
congratulate
you
on
finding
it
max
made
a
little
bow
but
to
continue
my
men
wonder
how
the
brandy
reaches
the
sawmill
soon
they
think
that
the
lorries
must
bring
it
they
think
so
for
two
reasons
first
they
can
find
no
other
way
the
lorries
are
the
only
vehicles
which
approach
nothing
goes
by
water
there
can
not
be
a
tunnel
because
there
is
no
place
for
the
other
end
there
remains
only
the
lorries
second
they
think
it
is
the
lorries
because
the
drivers
change
the
numbers
it
is
suspicious
is
it
not
yes
you
understand
me
perfectly
good
my
men
then
watch
the
lorries
they
get
help
from
the
police
at
bordeaux
they
find
the
firewood
trade
is
a
max
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
are
five
firms
to
which
the
lorries
go
and
of
the
five
four
his
gesture
indicated
a
despair
too
deep
for
words
to
serve
them
it
is
but
a
blind
so
my
men
think
but
the
fifth
firm
it
is
that
of
raymond
fils
one
of
the
biggest
distilleries
of
bordeaux
that
raymond
fils
are
sending
out
the
brandy
suggests
itself
to
my
men
at
last
the
affair
max
paused
and
willis
bowed
to
signify
his
appreciation
of
the
point
my
men
visit
raymond
fils
they
search
into
everything
they
find
the
law
is
not
broken
all
is
in
order
they
are
but
sir
if
these
people
are
smuggling
brandy
into
england
willis
was
beginning
when
the
other
interrupted
him
but
yes
monsieur
i
grasp
your
point
i
speak
of
french
law
it
is
different
from
yours
here
duty
is
not
charged
on
just
so
much
spirit
as
is
distilled
we
grant
the
distiller
a
license
and
it
allows
him
to
distill
any
quantity
up
to
the
figure
the
license
bears
but
monsieur
raymond
fils
are
how
do
you
say
it
well
within
their
limit
yes
they
do
not
break
the
french
therefore
sir
you
mean
you
can
not
help
further
my
dear
monsieur
what
would
you
i
have
done
my
best
for
you
i
make
inquiries
the
matter
is
not
for
me
with
the
most
excellent
wish
to
assist
what
more
can
i
willis
realizing
he
could
get
no
more
rose
nothing
sir
except
to
accept
on
my
own
part
and
that
of
my
department
our
hearty
thanks
for
what
you
have
done
i
can
assure
you
sir
i
quite
understand
your
position
and
i
greatly
appreciate
your
max
also
had
risen
he
politely
repeated
his
regrets
and
with
mutual
compliments
the
two
men
parted
willis
had
once
spent
a
holiday
in
paris
and
he
was
slightly
acquainted
with
the
city
he
strolled
on
through
the
busy
streets
brilliant
in
the
pale
autumn
sunlight
until
he
reached
the
grands
boulevards
there
entering
a
cafe
he
sat
down
called
for
a
bock
and
settled
himself
to
consider
his
next
step
the
position
created
by
max
action
was
disconcerting
willis
felt
himself
stranded
literally
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
sent
to
carry
out
an
investigation
among
a
people
whose
language
he
could
not
even
speak
he
saw
at
once
that
his
task
was
impossible
he
must
have
local
help
or
he
could
proceed
no
further
he
thought
of
his
own
department
the
excise
had
failed
him
what
about
the
surete
but
a
very
little
thought
convinced
him
that
he
was
even
less
likely
to
obtain
help
from
this
quarter
he
could
only
base
an
appeal
on
the
possibility
of
a
future
charge
of
conspiracy
to
murder
and
he
realized
that
the
evidence
for
that
was
too
slight
to
put
forward
seriously
what
was
to
be
done
so
far
as
he
could
see
but
one
thing
he
must
employ
a
private
detective
this
plan
would
meet
the
language
difficulty
by
which
he
was
so
completely
hung
up
he
went
to
a
call
office
and
got
his
chief
at
the
yard
on
the
long
distance
wire
the
latter
approved
his
suggestion
and
recommended
jules
laroche
of
the
rue
du
sommerard
near
the
sorbonne
half
an
hour
later
willis
reached
the
house
laroche
proved
to
be
a
tall
man
of
some
who
had
lived
in
london
for
some
years
and
spoke
as
good
english
as
willis
himself
he
listened
quietly
and
without
much
apparent
interest
to
what
his
visitor
had
to
tell
him
then
said
he
would
be
glad
to
take
on
the
job
we
had
better
go
to
bordeaux
this
evening
so
as
to
start
fresh
tomorrow
willis
suggested
two
at
the
station
the
other
returned
we
have
just
time
we
can
settle
our
plans
in
the
they
reached
the
st
jean
station
at
bordeaux
at
that
night
and
drove
to
the
hotel
they
had
decided
that
they
could
do
nothing
until
the
following
evening
when
they
would
go
out
to
the
clearing
and
see
what
a
search
of
the
mill
premises
might
reveal
next
morning
laroche
vanished
saying
he
had
friends
in
the
town
whom
he
wished
to
look
up
and
it
was
close
on
before
he
put
in
an
appearance
i
have
got
some
information
that
may
help
he
said
as
willis
greeted
him
though
i
not
connected
with
the
official
force
we
are
very
good
friends
and
have
worked
into
each
other
hands
i
happen
to
know
one
of
the
officers
of
the
local
police
and
he
got
me
the
information
it
seems
that
a
pierre
raymond
is
practically
the
owner
of
raymond
fils
the
distillers
you
mentioned
he
is
a
man
of
about
thirty
and
the
son
of
one
of
the
original
brothers
he
was
at
one
time
comfortably
off
and
lived
in
a
pleasant
villa
in
the
suburbs
but
latterly
he
has
been
going
the
pace
and
within
the
last
two
years
he
let
his
villa
and
bought
a
tiny
house
next
door
to
the
distillery
where
he
is
now
living
it
is
believed
his
money
went
at
monte
carlo
indeed
it
seems
he
is
a
wrong
all
round
at
all
events
he
is
known
to
be
hard
up
and
you
think
he
moved
in
so
that
he
could
load
up
that
brandy
at
night
that
what
i
think
laroche
admitted
you
see
there
is
the
motive
for
it
as
well
he
would
join
the
syndicate
unless
he
was
in
difficulties
i
fancy
pierre
raymond
will
be
an
interesting
willis
nodded
the
suggestion
was
worth
investigation
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
getting
hold
of
so
excellent
a
colleague
as
this
laroche
seemed
to
be
the
frenchman
during
the
day
had
hired
a
motor
bicycle
and
sidecar
and
as
dusk
began
to
fall
the
two
men
left
their
hotel
and
ran
out
along
the
bayonne
road
until
they
reached
the
lesque
there
they
hid
their
vehicle
behind
some
shrubs
and
reaching
the
end
of
the
lane
turned
down
it
it
was
pitch
dark
among
the
trees
and
they
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
the
track
until
they
reached
the
clearing
there
a
quarter
moon
rendered
objects
dimly
visible
and
willis
at
once
recognized
his
surroundings
from
the
description
he
had
received
from
hilliard
and
merriman
you
see
somebody
is
in
the
manager
house
he
whispered
pointing
to
a
light
which
gleamed
in
the
window
if
henri
has
taken
over
job
he
may
go
down
to
the
mill
as
coburn
did
had
we
better
wait
and
see
the
frenchman
agreeing
they
moved
round
the
fringe
of
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
just
as
merriman
had
done
on
a
similar
occasion
some
seven
weeks
earlier
and
as
they
crouched
in
the
shelter
of
a
clump
of
bushes
in
front
of
the
house
they
might
have
been
interested
to
know
that
it
was
from
these
same
shrubs
that
that
disconsolate
sentimentalist
had
lain
dreaming
of
his
lady
love
and
from
which
he
had
witnessed
her
father
stealthy
journey
to
the
mill
it
was
a
good
deal
colder
tonight
than
on
that
earlier
occasion
when
watch
was
kept
on
the
lonely
house
the
two
men
shivered
as
they
drew
their
collars
higher
round
their
necks
and
crouched
down
to
get
shelter
from
the
bitter
wind
they
had
resigned
themselves
to
a
weary
vigil
during
which
they
dared
not
even
smoke
but
they
had
not
to
wait
so
long
after
all
about
ten
the
light
went
out
in
the
window
and
not
five
minutes
later
they
saw
a
man
appear
at
the
side
door
and
walk
towards
the
mill
they
could
not
see
his
features
though
willis
assumed
he
was
henri
twenty
minutes
later
they
watched
him
return
and
then
all
once
more
was
still
we
had
better
give
him
an
hour
to
get
to
bed
willis
whispered
if
he
were
to
look
out
it
would
do
for
him
to
see
two
detectives
roaming
about
his
beloved
we
might
go
at
eleven
laroche
proposed
and
so
they
did
keeping
as
much
as
possible
in
the
shelter
of
the
bushes
they
approached
the
mill
willis
had
got
a
of
the
building
from
merriman
and
he
moved
round
to
the
office
door
his
bent
wire
proved
as
efficacious
with
french
locks
as
with
english
and
in
a
few
moments
they
stood
within
with
the
door
shut
behind
them
now
said
willis
carefully
shading
the
beam
of
his
electric
torch
let
see
those
lorries
first
of
as
has
already
been
stated
the
garage
was
next
to
the
office
and
passing
through
the
communicating
door
the
two
men
found
five
of
the
ponderous
vehicles
therein
a
moment
examination
of
the
number
plates
showed
that
on
all
the
machines
the
figures
were
separate
from
the
remainder
of
the
lettering
being
carried
on
small
brass
plates
which
dropped
vertically
into
place
through
slots
in
the
main
castings
but
the
joint
at
each
side
of
the
number
was
not
conspicuous
because
similar
vertical
lines
were
cut
into
the
brass
between
each
letter
of
the
whole
legend
that
good
laroche
observed
make
a
thing
unnoticeable
by
multiplying
it
of
the
five
lorries
two
were
loaded
with
firewood
and
three
empty
the
men
moved
round
examining
them
with
their
torches
hallo
laroche
called
suddenly
in
a
low
voice
what
have
we
here
willis
the
inspector
crossed
over
to
the
other
who
was
pointing
to
the
granolithic
floor
in
front
of
him
one
of
the
empty
lorries
was
close
to
the
office
wall
and
the
frenchman
stood
between
the
two
on
the
floor
were
three
drops
of
some
liquid
can
you
smell
them
he
inquired
willis
knelt
down
and
sniffed
then
slowly
got
up
again
good
man
he
said
with
a
trace
of
excitement
in
his
manner
brandy
right
yes
returned
the
other
security
has
made
our
nocturnal
friend
careless
the
stuff
must
have
come
from
this
lorry
i
they
turned
to
the
vehicle
and
examined
it
eagerly
for
some
time
they
could
see
nothing
remarkable
but
presently
it
gave
up
its
secret
the
deck
was
double
beneath
it
was
a
hollow
space
some
six
feet
by
nine
long
and
not
less
than
three
inches
deep
and
not
only
so
this
hollow
space
was
continued
up
under
the
unusually
large
and
wide
driver
seat
save
for
a
tiny
receptacle
for
petrol
in
a
word
the
whole
top
of
the
machine
was
a
vast
secret
tank
the
men
began
measuring
and
calculating
and
they
soon
found
that
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
gallons
of
liquid
could
be
carried
therein
one
hundred
and
fifty
gallons
of
brandy
per
trip
willis
ejaculated
lord
it
no
wonder
they
make
it
they
next
tackled
the
problem
of
how
the
tank
was
filled
and
emptied
and
at
last
their
perseverance
was
rewarded
behind
the
left
trailing
wheel
under
the
framing
was
a
small
hinged
door
about
six
inches
square
and
fastened
by
a
spring
operated
by
a
mock
rivet
head
this
being
opened
revealed
a
cavity
containing
a
pipe
connected
to
the
tank
and
fitted
with
a
and
the
half
of
a
union
coupling
the
pipe
which
connects
with
that
ca
be
far
away
laroche
suggested
we
might
have
a
look
round
for
the
obvious
place
was
the
wall
of
the
office
which
ran
not
more
than
three
feet
from
the
vehicle
it
was
finished
with
vertical
tongued
and
sheeting
and
a
comparatively
short
search
revealed
the
loose
board
the
detectives
were
by
this
time
expecting
behind
it
was
concealed
a
pipe
jointed
and
ending
in
the
other
half
of
the
union
coupling
it
was
evident
the
joints
would
allow
the
half
coupling
to
be
pulled
out
and
connected
with
that
on
the
lorry
the
pipe
ran
down
through
the
floor
showing
that
the
lorry
could
be
emptied
by
gravity
a
good
safe
scheme
laroche
commented
if
i
had
seen
that
lorry
a
hundred
times
i
should
never
have
suspected
a
tank
it
well
they
turned
to
examine
the
other
vehicles
all
four
were
identical
in
appearance
with
the
first
but
all
were
strictly
what
they
seemed
containing
no
secret
receptacle
merriman
said
they
had
six
lorries
willis
remarked
i
wonder
where
the
sixth
at
the
distillery
do
you
think
the
frenchman
returned
those
drops
prove
that
manager
fellow
has
just
been
unloading
this
one
i
expect
he
does
it
every
night
but
if
so
raymond
must
load
a
vehicle
every
night
that
true
we
may
assume
the
job
is
done
every
night
because
merriman
watched
coburn
come
down
here
three
nights
running
it
was
certainly
to
unload
the
doubtless
and
he
probably
came
at
two
in
the
morning
on
account
of
his
that
means
there
are
two
tank
lorries
willis
went
on
continuing
his
own
line
of
thought
i
say
laroche
let
mark
this
one
so
that
we
may
know
it
they
made
tiny
scratches
on
the
paint
at
each
corner
of
the
big
vehicle
then
willis
turned
back
to
the
office
i
like
to
find
that
cellar
while
we
here
he
remarked
we
know
there
is
a
cellar
for
those
customs
men
saw
the
girondin
loaded
from
it
we
might
have
a
look
round
for
the
then
ensued
a
search
similar
to
that
which
willis
had
carried
out
in
the
depot
at
ferriby
except
that
in
this
case
they
found
what
they
were
looking
for
in
a
much
shorter
time
in
the
office
was
a
flat
desk
with
the
usual
set
of
drawers
at
each
side
of
the
central
knee
well
and
when
willis
found
it
was
clamped
to
the
floor
he
felt
he
need
go
no
further
on
the
ground
in
the
knee
well
and
projecting
out
towards
the
revolving
chair
in
front
was
a
mat
willis
raised
it
and
at
once
observed
a
joint
across
the
boards
where
in
ordinary
circumstances
no
joint
should
be
he
fumbled
and
pressed
and
pulled
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
floor
under
the
well
rise
and
reveal
the
head
of
a
ladder
leading
down
into
the
darkness
below
here
we
are
he
called
softly
to
laroche
who
was
searching
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
cellar
into
which
the
two
detectives
descended
was
lined
with
timber
like
that
at
ferriby
indeed
the
two
were
identical
except
that
only
one
passage
that
under
the
wharf
led
out
of
this
one
it
contained
a
similar
large
tun
with
a
pipe
leading
down
the
passage
under
the
wharf
on
which
was
a
pump
the
only
difference
was
in
the
connection
of
the
pipes
at
ferriby
the
pump
conveyed
from
the
wharf
to
the
tun
here
it
was
from
the
tun
to
the
wharf
the
pipe
from
the
garage
came
down
through
the
ceiling
and
ran
direct
into
the
tun
the
two
men
walked
down
the
passage
towards
the
river
here
also
the
arrangement
was
the
same
as
at
ferriby
and
they
remained
only
long
enough
for
willis
to
point
out
to
the
frenchman
how
the
loading
apparatus
was
worked
well
said
the
former
as
they
returned
to
the
office
that
not
so
bad
for
one
day
i
suppose
it
all
we
can
do
here
if
we
can
learn
as
much
at
that
distillery
we
shall
soon
have
all
we
laroche
pointed
to
a
chair
sit
down
a
moment
he
invited
i
have
been
thinking
over
that
plan
we
discussed
in
the
train
of
searching
the
distillery
at
night
and
i
do
like
it
there
are
too
many
people
about
and
we
are
nearly
certain
to
be
seen
it
quite
different
from
working
a
place
like
quite
willis
answered
rather
testily
i
do
like
it
either
but
what
can
we
do
i
tell
you
what
i
should
laroche
leaned
forward
and
checked
his
points
on
his
fingers
that
lorry
had
just
been
unloaded
it
empty
now
and
if
our
theory
is
correct
it
will
be
taken
to
the
distillery
tomorrow
and
left
there
to
be
filled
up
again
is
that
so
willis
nodded
impatiently
and
the
other
went
on
now
it
is
clear
that
no
one
can
fill
up
that
tank
without
leaving
on
the
pipe
connections
in
that
secret
box
suppose
we
clean
those
surfaces
now
and
suppose
we
come
back
here
the
night
after
tomorrow
before
the
man
here
unloads
we
could
get
the
prints
of
the
person
who
filled
up
in
the
well
willis
asked
sharply
and
how
would
that
help
us
this
way
tomorrow
you
will
be
an
english
distiller
with
a
forest
you
could
get
cheap
near
your
works
you
have
an
idea
of
running
your
stills
on
wood
fires
you
naturally
call
to
see
how
raymond
does
it
and
you
get
shown
over
his
works
you
have
prepared
a
plan
of
your
proposals
you
hand
it
to
him
when
he
ca
put
it
down
on
a
desk
he
holds
it
between
his
fingers
and
thumb
and
eventually
returns
it
to
you
you
go
home
and
use
powder
you
have
his
you
compare
the
two
willis
was
impressed
the
plan
was
simple
and
it
promised
to
gain
for
them
all
the
information
they
required
without
recourse
to
a
hazardous
nocturnal
visit
to
the
distillery
but
he
wished
he
had
thought
of
it
himself
we
might
try
it
he
admitted
without
enthusiasm
it
could
do
much
harm
they
returned
to
the
garage
opened
the
secret
lid
beneath
the
lorry
and
with
a
cloth
moistened
with
petrol
cleaned
the
fittings
then
after
a
look
round
to
make
sure
that
nothing
had
been
disturbed
they
let
themselves
out
of
the
shed
regained
the
lane
and
their
machine
and
some
forty
minutes
later
were
in
bordeaux
on
reconsideration
they
decided
that
as
raymond
might
have
obtained
willis
description
from
captain
beamish
it
would
be
wiser
for
laroche
to
visit
the
distillery
next
morning
therefore
the
latter
bought
a
small
writing
block
and
taking
an
inside
leaf
which
he
carefully
avoided
touching
with
his
hands
he
drew
a
of
a
copied
from
an
illustration
in
a
book
of
reference
in
the
city
library
at
the
same
time
reading
up
the
subject
so
as
to
be
able
to
talk
on
it
without
giving
himself
away
then
he
set
out
on
his
mission
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
returned
got
that
all
right
he
exclaimed
as
he
rejoined
the
inspector
i
went
and
saw
the
fellow
said
i
was
going
to
start
a
distillery
in
the
ardennes
where
there
was
plenty
of
wood
and
wanted
to
see
his
plant
he
was
very
civil
and
took
me
round
and
showed
me
everything
there
is
a
shed
there
above
the
still
furnaces
with
hoppers
for
the
firewood
to
go
down
and
in
it
was
standing
the
lorry
the
lorry
i
saw
our
marks
on
the
corner
it
was
loaded
with
firewood
and
he
explained
that
it
would
be
emptied
last
thing
before
the
left
so
as
to
do
the
stills
during
the
night
well
i
got
a
general
look
round
the
concern
and
i
found
that
the
large
tuns
which
contain
the
finished
brandy
were
just
at
the
back
of
the
wall
of
the
shed
where
the
lorry
was
standing
so
it
is
easy
to
see
what
happens
evidently
there
is
a
pipe
through
the
wall
and
raymond
comes
down
at
night
and
fills
up
the
and
did
you
get
his
have
locking
the
door
of
their
private
room
laroche
took
from
his
pocket
the
sketch
he
had
made
he
held
this
up
quite
satisfactorily
he
went
on
and
there
should
be
good
willis
had
meanwhile
spread
a
newspaper
on
the
table
and
taken
from
his
suitcase
a
small
bottle
of
powdered
and
a
brush
laying
the
sketch
on
the
newspaper
he
gently
brushed
some
of
the
black
powder
over
it
blowing
off
the
surplus
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
men
there
showed
up
near
the
left
bottom
corner
the
distinct
mark
of
a
left
thumb
now
the
other
willis
turned
the
paper
and
repeated
the
operation
on
the
back
there
he
got
prints
of
a
left
fore
and
second
finger
excellent
clear
prints
those
willis
commented
continuing
and
now
i
have
something
to
tell
you
while
you
were
away
i
have
been
thinking
over
this
thing
and
i
believe
i
got
an
laroche
looked
interested
and
the
other
went
on
slowly
there
are
two
lorries
every
night
one
of
these
lies
at
the
distillery
and
the
other
at
the
clearing
one
is
being
loaded
and
the
other
unloaded
and
every
day
the
two
change
places
now
we
may
take
it
that
neither
of
those
lorries
is
sent
to
any
other
place
in
the
town
lest
the
brandy
tanks
might
be
discovered
for
the
same
reason
they
probably
only
make
the
one
run
mentioned
per
day
is
that
right
so
far
i
should
think
so
laroche
replied
cautiously
very
well
let
us
suppose
these
two
lorries
are
nos
and
no
goes
to
the
distillery
say
every
monday
wednesday
and
friday
and
returns
on
the
other
three
days
while
no
does
vice
versa
one
trip
each
day
remember
and
this
goes
on
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
now
is
it
too
much
to
assume
that
sooner
or
later
someone
is
bound
to
notice
this
some
worker
at
the
clearing
or
the
distillery
some
policeman
on
his
beat
some
clerk
at
a
window
the
route
and
if
anyone
notices
it
will
he
not
wonder
why
it
always
happens
that
these
two
lorries
go
to
this
one
place
and
to
no
other
while
the
syndicate
has
six
lorries
altogether
trading
into
the
town
and
if
this
observer
should
mention
his
discovery
to
someone
who
could
put
two
and
two
together
suspicion
might
be
aroused
investigation
undertaken
and
presently
the
syndicate
is
up
a
tree
now
do
you
see
what
i
getting
at
laroche
had
been
listening
eagerly
and
now
he
made
a
sudden
gesture
but
of
course
he
cried
delightedly
the
changing
of
the
numbers
the
changing
of
the
numbers
willis
repeated
at
least
it
looks
like
that
to
me
no
does
the
monday
run
to
the
distillery
they
change
the
number
plate
and
no
does
it
on
wednesday
while
no
runs
to
some
other
establishment
where
it
can
be
freely
examined
by
anyone
who
is
interested
how
does
it
strike
you
you
have
got
it
you
have
certainly
got
laroche
was
more
enthusiastic
than
the
inspector
had
before
seen
him
it
what
you
call
a
cute
scheme
quite
on
par
with
the
rest
of
the
business
they
leave
much
to
chance
these
and
yet
it
was
this
very
precaution
that
gave
them
no
doubt
but
that
was
an
you
ca
said
the
frenchman
sententiously
make
anything
completely
the
next
night
they
went
out
to
the
clearing
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
once
more
entered
the
shed
there
with
more
powder
white
this
tested
the
tank
lorry
for
as
they
had
hoped
there
were
several
on
the
secret
fittings
among
others
a
clear
print
of
a
left
thumb
on
the
rivet
head
of
the
spring
a
moment
examination
only
was
necessary
the
prints
were
those
of
pierre
raymond
once
again
inspector
willis
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
completed
his
case
and
once
again
second
thoughts
showed
him
that
he
was
as
far
away
from
that
desired
end
as
ever
he
had
been
trying
to
find
accomplices
in
the
murder
of
coburn
and
by
a
curious
perversity
instead
of
finding
them
he
had
bit
by
bit
solved
the
mystery
of
the
syndicate
he
had
shown
firstly
that
they
were
smuggling
brandy
and
secondly
how
they
were
doing
it
for
that
he
would
no
doubt
get
a
reward
but
such
was
not
his
aim
what
he
wanted
was
to
complete
his
own
case
and
get
the
approval
of
his
own
superiors
and
bring
promotion
nearer
and
in
this
he
had
failed
for
hours
he
pondered
over
the
problem
then
suddenly
an
idea
which
seemed
promising
flashed
into
his
mind
he
thought
it
over
with
the
utmost
care
and
finally
decided
that
in
the
absence
of
something
better
he
must
try
it
in
the
morning
the
two
men
travelled
to
paris
and
willis
there
taking
leave
of
his
colleague
crossed
to
london
and
an
hour
later
was
with
his
chief
at
the
yard
chapter
willis
spreads
his
net
though
inspector
willis
had
spent
so
much
time
out
of
london
in
his
following
up
of
the
case
he
had
by
no
means
lost
sight
of
madeleine
coburn
and
merriman
the
girl
he
knew
was
still
staying
with
her
aunt
at
eastbourne
and
the
local
police
authorities
from
whom
he
got
his
information
believed
that
her
youth
and
health
were
reasserting
themselves
and
that
she
was
rapidly
recovering
from
the
shock
of
her
father
tragic
death
merriman
haunted
the
town
he
practically
lived
at
the
george
going
up
and
down
daily
to
his
office
and
spending
as
many
of
his
evenings
and
his
sundays
at
luttrell
as
he
dared
but
though
the
young
man
had
worn
himself
almost
to
a
shadow
by
his
efforts
he
felt
that
the
realization
of
his
hopes
was
as
far
off
as
ever
madeleine
had
told
him
that
she
would
not
marry
him
until
the
mystery
of
her
father
murder
was
cleared
up
and
the
guilty
parties
brought
to
justice
and
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
afraid
that
she
would
keep
her
word
in
vain
he
implored
her
to
consider
the
living
rather
than
the
dead
and
not
to
wreck
his
life
and
her
own
for
what
after
all
was
but
a
sentiment
but
though
she
listened
to
his
entreaties
and
was
always
kind
and
gentle
she
remained
inflexible
in
her
resolve
merriman
felt
that
his
only
plan
failing
the
discovery
of
coburn
assassin
was
unobtrusively
to
keep
as
much
as
possible
in
her
company
in
the
hope
that
she
would
grow
accustomed
to
his
presences
and
perhaps
in
time
come
to
need
it
under
these
circumstances
his
anxiety
as
to
the
progress
of
the
case
was
very
great
and
on
several
occasions
he
had
written
to
willis
asking
him
how
his
inquiry
was
going
on
but
the
inspector
had
not
been
communicative
and
merriman
had
no
idea
how
matters
actually
stood
it
was
therefore
with
feelings
of
pleasurable
anticipation
that
he
received
a
telephone
call
from
willis
at
scotland
yard
i
have
just
returned
from
bordeaux
the
inspector
said
and
i
am
anxious
to
have
a
chat
with
miss
coburn
on
some
points
that
have
arisen
i
should
be
glad
of
your
presence
also
if
possible
can
you
arrange
an
interview
do
you
want
her
to
come
to
town
not
necessarily
i
will
go
to
eastbourne
if
more
convenient
but
our
meeting
must
be
kept
strictly
secret
the
syndicate
must
not
get
to
merriman
felt
excitement
and
hope
rising
within
him
better
go
to
eastbourne
then
he
advised
come
down
with
me
tonight
by
the
from
no
willis
answered
we
must
be
seen
together
i
shall
meet
you
at
the
corner
of
the
grand
parade
and
carlisle
road
at
nine
this
being
agreed
on
both
men
began
to
make
their
arrangements
in
merriman
case
these
consisted
in
throwing
up
his
work
at
the
office
and
taking
the
first
train
to
eastbourne
at
five
he
was
asking
for
miss
coburn
at
luttrell
door
dear
madeleine
he
said
when
he
had
told
her
his
news
you
must
not
begin
to
expect
things
it
may
mean
nothing
at
all
do
build
on
but
soon
he
had
made
her
as
much
excited
as
he
was
himself
he
stayed
for
dinner
leaving
shortly
before
nine
to
keep
his
appointment
with
willis
both
men
were
to
return
to
the
house
when
madeleine
would
see
them
alone
inspector
willis
did
not
travel
by
merriman
train
instead
he
caught
the
to
brighton
dined
there
and
then
slipping
out
of
the
hotel
motored
over
to
eastbourne
dismissing
his
vehicle
at
the
grand
hotel
he
walked
down
the
parade
and
found
merriman
at
the
rendezvous
in
ten
minutes
they
were
in
luttrell
i
am
sorry
miss
coburn
willis
began
politely
to
intrude
on
you
in
this
way
but
the
fact
is
i
want
your
help
and
indirectly
the
help
of
merriman
but
it
is
only
fair
i
think
to
tell
you
first
what
has
transpired
since
we
last
met
i
must
warn
you
however
that
i
can
only
do
so
in
the
strictest
confidence
no
whisper
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
must
pass
the
lips
of
either
of
i
promise
said
merriman
instantly
and
i
echoed
madeleine
i
did
require
that
assurance
willis
went
on
it
is
sufficient
that
you
understand
the
gravity
of
the
situation
well
after
the
inquest
i
set
to
work
and
he
briefly
related
the
story
of
his
investigations
in
london
and
in
hull
his
discoveries
at
ferriby
his
proof
that
archer
was
the
actual
murderer
the
details
of
the
smuggling
organization
and
finally
his
suspicion
that
the
other
members
of
the
syndicate
were
privy
to
coburn
death
together
with
his
failure
to
prove
it
his
two
listeners
heard
him
with
eager
attention
in
which
interest
in
his
story
was
mingled
with
admiration
of
his
achievement
so
hilliard
was
right
about
the
brandy
after
all
merriman
exclaimed
he
deserves
some
credit
for
that
i
think
he
believed
in
it
all
the
time
in
spite
of
our
conclusion
that
we
had
proved
it
impossible
by
jove
how
you
can
be
had
willis
turned
to
him
do
be
disappointed
about
your
part
in
it
sir
he
advised
i
consider
that
you
and
hilliard
did
uncommonly
well
i
may
tell
you
that
i
thought
so
much
of
your
work
that
i
checked
nothing
of
what
you
had
merriman
colored
with
pleasure
jolly
good
of
you
to
say
so
i
sure
inspector
he
said
but
afraid
most
of
the
credit
for
that
goes
to
it
was
your
joint
work
i
was
speaking
of
willis
insisted
but
now
to
get
on
to
business
as
i
said
my
difficulty
is
that
i
suspect
the
members
of
the
syndicate
of
complicity
in
coburn
death
but
i
ca
prove
it
i
have
thought
out
a
plan
which
may
or
may
not
produce
this
proof
it
is
in
this
that
i
want
your
mr
inspector
cried
madeleine
reproachfully
need
you
ask
for
it
willis
laughed
i
do
think
so
but
i
ca
very
well
come
in
and
command
it
you
of
course
you
can
madeleine
returned
you
know
very
well
that
in
such
a
cause
merriman
and
i
would
do
i
believe
it
and
i
am
going
to
put
you
to
the
test
i
tell
you
my
idea
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
these
people
might
be
made
to
give
themselves
away
suppose
they
had
one
of
their
private
meetings
to
discuss
the
affairs
of
the
syndicate
and
that
unknown
to
them
witnesses
could
be
present
to
overhear
what
was
said
would
there
not
at
least
be
a
sporting
chance
that
they
would
incriminate
themselves
yes
said
merriman
much
interested
likely
enough
but
i
do
see
how
you
could
arrange
willis
smiled
slightly
i
think
it
might
be
managed
he
answered
if
a
meeting
were
to
take
place
we
could
easily
learn
where
it
was
to
be
held
and
hear
what
went
on
but
the
first
point
is
the
difficulty
the
question
of
the
holding
of
the
meeting
in
the
ordinary
course
there
might
be
none
for
months
therefore
we
must
take
steps
to
have
one
summoned
and
that
he
turned
to
madeleine
is
where
i
want
your
his
hearers
stared
mystified
and
willis
resumed
something
must
happen
of
such
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
syndicate
that
the
leaders
will
decide
that
a
full
conference
of
the
members
is
necessary
so
far
as
i
can
see
you
alone
can
cause
that
something
to
happen
i
will
tell
you
how
but
i
must
warn
you
that
i
fear
it
will
rake
up
painful
madeleine
her
lips
parted
was
hanging
on
his
words
go
on
she
said
quickly
we
have
settled
all
thank
you
said
willis
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
i
have
here
the
draft
of
a
letter
which
i
want
you
to
write
to
captain
beamish
you
can
phrase
it
as
you
like
in
fact
i
want
it
in
your
own
words
read
it
over
and
you
will
the
draft
ran
as
follows
silverdale
road
eastbourne
dear
captain
beamish
in
going
over
some
papers
belonging
to
my
late
father
i
learn
to
my
surprise
that
he
was
not
a
salaried
official
of
your
syndicate
but
a
partner
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
as
his
heir
i
am
entitled
to
his
share
of
the
capital
of
the
concern
or
at
all
events
to
the
interest
on
it
i
have
to
express
my
astonishment
that
no
recognition
of
this
fact
has
as
yet
been
made
by
the
syndicate
i
may
say
that
i
have
also
come
on
some
notes
relative
to
the
business
of
the
syndicate
which
have
filled
me
with
anxiety
and
dismay
but
which
i
do
not
care
to
refer
to
in
detail
in
writing
i
think
i
should
like
an
interview
with
you
to
hear
your
explanation
of
these
two
matters
and
to
discuss
what
action
is
to
be
taken
with
regard
to
them
you
could
perhaps
find
it
convenient
to
call
on
me
here
or
i
could
meet
you
in
london
if
you
preferred
it
yours
faithfully
madeleine
madeleine
made
a
grimace
as
she
read
this
letter
oh
she
cried
but
how
could
i
do
that
i
did
find
any
notes
you
know
and
besides
it
would
be
so
dreadful
acting
as
a
decoy
there
something
more
important
than
that
merriman
burst
in
indignantly
do
you
realize
mr
inspector
that
if
miss
coburn
were
to
send
that
letter
she
would
put
herself
in
very
real
danger
not
at
all
willis
answered
quietly
you
have
not
heard
my
whole
scheme
my
idea
is
that
when
beamish
gets
that
letter
he
will
lay
it
before
archer
and
they
will
decide
that
they
must
find
out
what
miss
coburn
knows
and
get
her
quieted
about
the
money
they
will
say
did
think
she
was
that
kind
but
it
evident
she
is
out
for
what
she
can
get
let
pay
her
a
thousand
or
two
a
year
as
interest
on
her
father
alleged
share
it
will
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
to
us
but
it
will
seem
a
big
thing
to
her
and
that
will
give
us
a
hold
on
her
keeping
silence
if
she
really
does
know
anything
then
beamish
will
ask
miss
coburn
to
meet
him
probably
in
london
she
will
do
so
not
alone
but
with
some
near
friend
perhaps
yourself
merriman
seeing
you
were
at
the
clearing
and
know
something
of
the
circumstances
you
will
be
armed
and
in
addition
i
shall
have
a
couple
of
men
from
the
yard
within
call
say
disguised
as
waiters
if
a
restaurant
is
chosen
for
the
meeting
you
miss
coburn
will
come
out
in
a
new
light
at
that
meeting
you
will
put
up
a
bluff
you
will
tell
captain
beamish
you
know
he
is
smuggling
brandy
and
that
the
money
he
offers
wo
meet
the
case
at
all
you
must
have
pounds
down
paid
as
the
value
of
your
father
share
in
the
concern
and
in
such
a
way
as
will
raise
no
suspicion
that
you
knew
what
was
in
progress
the
interview
we
can
go
into
in
detail
later
but
it
must
be
so
arranged
that
beamish
will
see
merriman
hand
in
the
whole
thing
on
the
pounds
being
paid
the
incriminating
notes
will
be
handed
over
you
will
explain
that
as
a
precautionary
measure
you
have
sent
them
in
a
sealed
envelope
to
your
solicitor
together
with
a
statement
of
the
whole
case
with
instructions
to
open
the
same
that
afternoon
if
not
reclaimed
before
that
by
yourself
in
person
now
with
regard
to
your
objection
miss
coburn
i
quite
realize
what
an
exceedingly
nasty
job
this
will
be
for
you
in
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
not
suggest
it
but
the
people
against
whom
i
ask
you
to
act
did
not
hesitate
to
lure
your
father
into
the
cab
in
which
they
intended
to
shoot
him
they
did
this
by
a
show
of
friendliness
and
by
playing
on
the
trust
he
reposed
in
them
and
they
did
it
deliberately
and
in
cold
blood
you
need
not
hesitate
from
nice
feeling
to
act
as
i
suggest
in
order
to
get
justice
for
your
madeleine
braced
herself
up
i
know
you
are
right
and
if
there
is
no
other
way
i
shall
not
hesitate
she
said
but
there
was
a
piteous
look
in
her
eyes
and
you
will
help
me
seymour
she
looked
appealingly
at
her
companion
merriman
demurred
on
the
ground
that
even
after
taking
all
precautions
the
girl
would
still
be
in
danger
but
she
would
not
consider
that
aspect
of
the
question
at
all
and
at
last
he
was
overborne
madeleine
with
her
companion
help
then
rewrote
the
letter
in
her
own
phraseology
and
addressed
it
to
captain
beamish
messrs
the
landes
syndicate
ferriby
hull
having
arranged
that
he
would
receive
immediate
telephonic
information
of
a
reply
willis
left
the
house
and
was
driven
back
to
brighton
next
morning
he
returned
to
london
the
girondin
he
reckoned
would
reach
ferriby
on
the
following
friday
and
on
the
thursday
he
returned
to
hull
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
with
hunt
as
he
expected
the
latter
business
would
by
this
time
be
too
well
known
he
therefore
went
to
a
different
hotel
ringing
up
the
excise
man
and
arranging
a
meeting
for
that
evening
hunt
turned
up
about
nine
and
the
two
men
retired
to
willis
bedroom
where
the
inspector
described
his
doings
at
bordeaux
then
hunt
told
of
his
discoveries
since
the
other
had
left
i
got
all
i
want
at
last
he
said
you
remember
we
both
realized
that
those
five
houses
were
getting
in
vastly
more
brandy
than
they
could
possibly
sell
well
i
found
out
how
they
are
getting
rid
of
the
willis
looked
his
question
they
are
selling
it
round
to
other
houses
they
have
three
men
doing
nothing
else
they
go
in
and
buy
anything
from
a
bottle
up
to
three
or
four
kegs
and
there
is
always
a
good
reason
for
the
purchase
usually
it
is
that
they
represent
a
publican
whose
stock
is
just
out
and
who
wants
a
quantity
to
keep
him
going
but
the
point
is
that
all
the
purchases
are
perfectly
in
order
they
are
openly
made
and
the
full
price
is
paid
but
following
it
up
i
discovered
that
there
is
afterwards
a
secret
rebate
a
small
percentage
of
the
price
is
refunded
this
pays
everyone
concerned
and
ensures
willis
nodded
it
well
managed
all
through
he
commented
they
deserved
to
yes
but
they
not
going
to
all
the
same
my
discoveries
wo
help
you
i
satisfied
that
none
of
these
people
know
anything
of
the
main
early
on
the
following
morning
willis
was
once
more
at
work
dawn
had
not
completely
come
when
he
motored
from
the
city
to
the
end
of
the
ferriby
lane
ten
minutes
after
leaving
his
car
he
was
in
the
ruined
cottage
there
he
unearthed
his
telephone
from
the
box
in
which
he
had
hidden
it
and
took
up
his
old
position
at
the
window
prepared
to
listen
in
to
whatever
messages
might
pass
he
had
a
longer
vigil
than
on
previous
occasions
and
it
was
not
until
nearly
four
that
he
saw
archer
lock
the
door
of
his
office
and
move
towards
the
almost
immediately
came
benson
voice
calling
are
you
there
they
conversed
as
before
for
a
few
minutes
the
girondin
it
appeared
had
arrived
some
hours
previously
with
a
cargo
of
it
was
clear
that
the
members
of
the
syndicate
had
agreed
never
to
mention
the
word
it
was
willis
presumed
a
likely
enough
precaution
against
eavesdroppers
and
he
thought
how
much
sooner
both
hilliard
and
himself
would
have
guessed
the
real
nature
of
the
conspiracy
had
it
not
been
observed
presently
they
came
to
the
subject
about
which
willis
was
expecting
to
hear
beamish
the
manager
explained
was
there
and
wished
to
speak
to
archer
that
you
archer
came
in
what
willis
believed
he
recognized
as
the
captain
voice
i
had
rather
a
nasty
jar
a
letter
from
madeleine
coburn
wants
coburn
share
in
the
affair
and
hints
at
knowledge
of
what
we
really
up
to
reads
as
if
she
was
put
up
to
it
by
someone
probably
that
merriman
hold
on
a
minute
and
i
read
it
to
then
followed
madeleine
letter
archer
reply
was
short
but
lurid
and
willis
not
withstanding
the
seriousness
of
the
matter
could
not
help
smiling
there
was
a
pause
and
then
archer
asked
when
did
you
get
that
now
when
we
got
in
but
benson
tells
me
the
letter
has
been
waiting
for
me
for
three
you
might
read
it
beamish
did
so
and
presently
archer
went
on
in
my
opinion
we
need
be
unduly
alarmed
of
course
she
may
know
something
but
i
fancy
it
what
you
say
that
merriman
is
getting
her
to
put
up
a
bluff
but
it
take
thinking
over
i
have
an
appointment
presently
and
in
any
case
we
could
discuss
it
adequately
over
the
telephone
we
must
meet
could
you
come
up
to
my
house
tonight
yes
if
you
think
it
wise
it
not
wise
but
i
think
we
must
risk
it
you
not
known
here
but
come
alone
benson
should
attempt
right
what
time
what
about
nine
i
often
work
in
the
evenings
and
i
never
disturbed
come
round
to
my
study
window
and
i
shall
be
there
tap
lightly
the
window
is
on
the
side
of
the
house
as
you
come
up
the
drive
the
fourth
from
the
corner
you
can
slip
round
to
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
and
keep
on
the
grass
the
whole
right
nine
the
switch
of
the
telephone
clicked
and
presently
willis
saw
archer
reappear
in
his
office
the
inspector
was
disappointed
he
had
hoped
that
the
conspirators
would
have
completed
their
plans
over
the
telephone
and
that
he
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
but
listen
to
what
they
arranged
now
he
saw
that
if
he
were
to
gain
the
information
he
required
it
would
mean
a
vast
deal
more
trouble
and
perhaps
danger
as
well
he
felt
that
at
all
costs
he
must
be
present
at
the
interview
in
archer
study
but
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
difficult
the
accomplishment
of
this
seemed
he
was
ignorant
of
the
plan
of
the
house
or
what
if
any
there
might
be
in
the
study
nor
could
he
think
of
any
scheme
by
which
he
could
gain
admittance
further
there
was
but
little
time
in
which
to
make
inquiries
or
arrangements
as
he
could
not
leave
his
present
retreat
until
dark
or
say
six
he
saw
the
problem
would
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
he
had
ever
faced
but
the
need
for
solving
it
was
paramount
and
when
darkness
had
set
in
he
let
himself
out
of
the
cottage
and
walked
the
mile
or
more
to
archer
residence
it
was
a
big
square
block
of
a
house
approached
by
a
short
winding
drive
on
each
side
of
which
was
a
border
of
rhododendrons
the
porch
was
in
front
and
the
group
of
windows
to
the
left
of
it
were
lighted
up
the
willis
imagined
he
followed
the
directions
given
to
beamish
and
moved
round
to
the
right
keeping
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
shrubs
the
third
and
fourth
windows
from
the
corner
on
the
right
side
were
also
lighted
up
and
the
inspector
crept
silently
up
and
peeped
over
the
sill
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
but
that
on
the
third
window
was
not
quite
pulled
to
the
bottom
and
through
the
narrow
slit
remaining
he
could
see
into
the
room
it
was
empty
but
evidently
only
for
the
time
being
as
a
cheerful
fire
burned
in
the
grate
furnished
as
a
study
everything
bore
the
impress
of
wealth
and
culture
by
looking
from
each
end
of
the
slot
in
turn
nearly
all
the
floor
area
and
more
than
half
of
the
walls
became
visible
and
a
glance
showed
the
inspector
that
nowhere
in
his
purview
was
there
anything
behind
which
he
might
conceal
himself
supposing
he
could
obtain
admission
but
could
he
obtain
admission
he
examined
the
sashes
they
were
of
steel
hinged
and
opening
inwards
in
the
french
manner
and
were
fastened
by
a
handle
which
could
not
be
turned
from
without
had
they
been
the
ordinary
english
sashes
fastened
with
snibs
he
would
have
had
the
window
open
in
a
few
seconds
but
with
these
he
could
do
nothing
he
moved
round
the
house
examining
the
other
windows
all
were
fitted
with
the
same
type
of
sash
and
all
were
fastened
the
front
door
also
was
shut
and
though
he
might
have
been
able
to
open
it
with
his
bent
wire
he
felt
that
to
adventure
himself
into
the
hall
without
any
idea
of
the
interior
would
be
too
dangerous
here
as
always
he
was
hampered
by
the
fact
that
discovery
would
mean
the
ruin
of
his
case
having
completed
the
circuit
of
the
building
he
looked
once
more
through
the
study
window
at
once
he
saw
that
his
opportunity
was
gone
at
the
large
desk
sat
archer
busily
writing
various
expedients
to
obtain
admission
to
the
house
passed
through
his
brain
all
to
be
rejected
as
impracticable
unless
some
unexpected
incident
occurred
of
which
he
could
take
advantage
he
began
to
fear
he
would
be
unable
to
accomplish
his
plan
as
by
this
time
it
was
half
past
eight
he
withdrew
from
the
window
and
took
up
his
position
behind
a
neighboring
shrub
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
by
beamish
should
the
latter
come
early
to
the
rendezvous
he
had
however
to
wait
for
more
than
half
an
hour
before
a
dark
form
became
vaguely
visible
in
the
faint
light
which
shone
through
the
study
blinds
it
approached
the
window
and
a
tap
sounded
on
the
glass
in
a
moment
the
blind
went
up
the
sash
opened
the
figure
passed
through
the
sash
closed
softly
and
the
blind
was
once
more
drawn
down
in
three
seconds
willis
was
back
at
the
sill
the
slot
under
the
blind
still
remained
the
other
window
having
been
opened
willis
first
examined
the
fastening
of
the
latter
in
the
hope
of
opening
the
sash
enough
to
hear
what
was
said
but
to
his
disappointment
he
found
it
tightly
closed
he
had
therefore
to
be
content
with
observation
through
the
slot
he
watched
the
two
men
sit
down
at
either
side
of
the
fire
and
light
cigars
then
beamish
handed
the
other
a
paper
presumably
letter
archer
having
read
it
twice
a
discussion
began
at
first
archer
seemed
to
be
making
some
statement
to
judge
by
the
other
rapt
attention
and
the
gestures
of
excitement
or
concern
which
he
made
but
no
word
of
the
conversation
reached
the
inspector
ears
he
watched
for
nearly
two
hours
getting
gradually
more
and
more
cramped
from
his
stooping
position
and
chilled
by
the
sharp
autumn
air
during
all
that
time
the
men
talked
earnestly
then
shortly
after
eleven
they
got
up
and
approached
the
window
willis
retreated
quickly
behind
his
bush
the
window
opened
softly
and
beamish
stepped
out
to
the
grass
the
light
shining
on
his
strong
rather
lowering
face
archer
leaned
out
of
the
window
after
him
and
willis
heard
him
say
in
low
tones
then
speak
up
at
eleven
to
which
the
other
nodded
and
silently
withdrew
the
window
closed
the
blind
was
lowered
and
all
remained
silent
willis
waited
for
some
minutes
to
let
the
captain
get
clear
away
then
leaving
his
and
again
keeping
on
the
grass
he
passed
down
the
drive
and
out
on
to
the
road
he
was
profoundly
disappointed
he
had
failed
in
his
purpose
and
the
only
ray
of
light
in
the
immediate
horizon
was
that
last
remark
of
archer
if
it
meant
as
he
presumed
it
did
that
the
men
were
to
communicate
by
the
secret
telephone
at
eleven
in
the
morning
all
might
not
yet
be
lost
he
might
learn
then
what
he
had
missed
tonight
it
seemed
hardly
worth
while
returning
to
hull
he
therefore
went
to
the
raven
bar
in
ferriby
knocked
up
the
landlord
and
by
paying
four
or
five
times
the
proper
amount
managed
to
get
a
meal
and
some
food
for
the
next
day
then
he
returned
to
the
deserted
cottage
he
let
himself
in
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
lying
down
on
the
floor
with
his
head
on
his
arm
fell
asleep
next
morning
found
him
back
at
his
post
at
the
broken
window
with
the
telephone
receiver
at
his
ear
his
surmise
at
the
meaning
of
remark
at
the
study
window
proved
to
be
correct
for
precisely
at
eleven
he
heard
the
familiar
are
you
there
which
heralded
a
conversation
then
beamish
voice
went
on
i
have
talked
this
business
over
with
benson
and
he
makes
a
suggestion
which
i
think
is
an
improvement
on
our
plan
he
thinks
we
should
have
our
general
meeting
in
london
immediately
after
i
have
interviewed
madeleine
coburn
the
advantage
of
this
scheme
would
be
that
if
we
found
she
possessed
really
serious
knowledge
we
could
immediately
consider
our
next
move
and
i
could
if
necessary
see
her
again
that
night
benson
thinks
i
should
fix
up
a
meeting
with
her
at
say
or
that
i
could
then
join
you
at
lunch
at
after
which
we
could
discuss
my
report
and
i
could
see
the
girl
again
at
or
it
seems
to
me
a
sound
scheme
what
do
you
say
it
has
advantages
archer
answered
slowly
if
you
both
think
it
best
i
quite
agreeable
where
then
should
the
meetings
be
held
in
the
case
of
miss
coburn
there
would
be
no
change
in
our
last
arrangement
a
private
at
the
gresham
would
still
do
excellently
if
you
going
to
town
you
could
fix
up
some
place
for
our
own
meeting
preferably
close
very
well
i
going
up
on
tuesday
in
any
case
and
i
arrange
something
i
shall
let
benson
know
and
he
can
tell
you
and
the
others
i
think
we
should
all
go
up
by
separate
trains
i
shall
probably
go
by
the
from
hull
on
the
evening
before
let
see
when
will
you
be
in
again
monday
week
about
midday
i
expect
benson
could
go
up
that
morning
bulla
and
i
separately
by
the
and
fox
henri
and
raymond
if
he
comes
by
the
first
train
next
morning
how
would
that
do
all
right
i
think
the
meetings
then
will
be
on
tuesday
at
and
benson
to
give
you
the
address
of
the
second
we
can
arrange
at
the
meeting
about
returning
to
righto
beamish
answered
shortly
and
the
conversation
ended
willis
for
once
was
greatly
cheered
by
what
he
had
overheard
his
failure
on
the
previous
evening
was
evidently
not
going
to
be
so
serious
as
he
had
feared
he
had
in
spite
of
it
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
conspirators
plans
and
he
chuckled
with
delight
as
he
thought
how
excellently
his
ruse
was
working
and
how
completely
the
gang
were
walking
into
the
trap
which
he
had
prepared
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
held
all
the
trump
cards
of
the
situation
and
if
he
played
his
hand
carefully
he
should
undoubtedly
get
not
only
the
men
but
the
evidence
to
convict
them
to
learn
the
rendezvous
for
the
meeting
of
the
syndicate
he
would
have
to
follow
archer
to
town
and
shadow
him
as
he
did
his
business
this
was
saturday
and
the
managing
director
had
said
he
was
going
on
the
following
tuesday
from
that
there
would
be
a
week
until
the
meeting
which
would
give
more
than
time
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
willis
remained
in
the
cottage
until
dark
that
evening
then
making
his
way
to
ferriby
station
returned
to
hull
his
first
action
on
reaching
the
city
was
to
send
a
letter
to
madeleine
asking
her
to
forward
beamish
reply
to
him
at
the
yard
on
monday
he
began
his
shadowing
of
archer
lest
the
latter
should
go
to
town
that
day
but
the
distiller
made
no
move
until
the
tuesday
travelling
up
that
morning
by
the
from
hull
at
they
reached
king
cross
archer
leisurely
left
the
train
and
crossing
the
platform
stepped
into
a
taxi
and
was
driven
away
willis
in
a
second
taxi
followed
about
fifty
yards
behind
the
chase
led
westwards
along
the
euston
road
until
turning
to
the
left
down
gower
street
the
leading
vehicle
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
the
gresham
hotel
in
bedford
square
willis
taxi
ran
on
past
the
other
and
through
the
backlight
the
inspector
saw
archer
alight
and
pass
into
the
hotel
stopping
at
a
door
in
bloomsbury
street
willis
sat
watching
in
about
five
minutes
archer
reappeared
and
again
entering
his
taxi
was
driven
off
southwards
willis
car
slid
once
more
in
behind
the
other
and
the
chase
recommenced
they
crossed
oxford
street
and
passing
down
charing
cross
road
stopped
at
a
small
foreign
restaurant
in
a
narrow
lane
off
cranbourne
street
willis
taxi
repeated
its
previous
maneuver
and
halted
opposite
a
shop
from
where
the
inspector
could
see
the
other
vehicle
through
the
backlight
he
thought
he
had
all
the
information
he
needed
but
there
was
the
risk
that
archer
might
not
find
the
room
he
required
at
the
little
restaurant
and
have
to
try
elsewhere
this
second
call
lasted
longer
than
the
first
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
before
the
distiller
emerged
and
reentered
his
taxi
this
time
the
chase
was
short
at
the
trocadero
archer
got
out
dismissed
his
taxi
and
passed
into
the
building
willis
following
discreetly
was
in
time
to
see
the
other
seat
himself
at
a
table
and
leisurely
take
up
the
bill
of
fare
believing
the
quarry
would
remain
where
he
was
for
another
half
hour
at
least
the
inspector
slipped
unobserved
out
of
the
room
and
jumping
once
more
into
his
taxi
was
driven
back
to
the
little
restaurant
off
cranbourne
street
he
sent
for
the
manager
and
drew
him
aside
i
inspector
willis
from
scotland
yard
he
said
with
a
sharpness
strangely
at
variance
with
his
usual
mode
of
address
see
he
showed
his
credentials
at
which
the
manager
bowed
obsequiously
i
am
following
that
gentleman
who
was
in
here
inquiring
about
a
room
a
few
minutes
ago
i
want
to
know
what
passed
between
the
manager
who
was
a
sly
person
seemingly
of
eastern
blood
began
to
hedge
but
willis
cut
him
short
with
scant
ceremony
now
look
here
my
friend
he
said
brusquely
i
have
time
to
waste
with
you
that
man
that
you
were
talking
to
is
wanted
for
murder
and
what
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
you
going
to
act
with
the
police
or
against
them
if
you
give
us
any
trouble
you
may
find
yourself
in
the
dock
as
an
accomplice
after
the
fact
in
any
case
it
not
healthy
for
a
man
in
your
position
to
run
up
against
the
his
bluff
had
more
effect
that
it
might
have
had
with
an
englishman
in
similar
circumstances
and
the
manager
became
polite
and
anxious
to
assist
yes
the
gentleman
had
come
about
a
room
he
had
ordered
lunch
in
a
private
room
for
a
party
of
seven
for
on
the
following
tuesday
he
had
been
very
particular
about
the
room
had
insisted
on
seeing
it
and
had
approved
of
it
it
appeared
the
party
had
some
business
to
discuss
after
lunch
and
the
gentleman
had
required
a
guarantee
that
they
would
not
be
interrupted
the
gentleman
had
given
his
name
as
hodgson
the
price
had
been
agreed
on
willis
in
his
turn
demanded
to
see
the
room
and
he
was
led
upstairs
to
a
small
and
rather
dark
chamber
containing
a
oval
table
surrounded
by
red
plush
chairs
a
red
plush
sofa
along
one
side
and
a
narrow
sideboard
along
another
the
walls
supported
tawdry
and
dilapidated
decorations
in
which
beveled
mirrors
and
faded
gilding
bore
a
prominent
part
two
large
but
quite
worthless
oil
paintings
hung
above
the
fireplace
and
the
sideboard
respectively
and
the
window
was
covered
with
gelatine
paper
simulating
stained
glass
inspector
willis
stood
surveying
the
scene
with
a
frown
on
his
brow
how
on
earth
was
he
to
secrete
himself
in
this
barely
furnished
apartment
there
was
not
room
under
the
sofa
still
less
beneath
the
sideboard
nor
was
there
any
adjoining
room
or
cupboard
in
which
he
could
hide
his
keen
ear
pressed
to
the
keyhole
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
this
case
he
was
doing
nothing
but
coming
up
against
one
insoluble
problem
after
another
ruefully
he
recalled
the
conversation
in
archer
study
and
he
decided
that
whatever
it
cost
in
time
and
trouble
there
must
be
no
repetition
of
that
fiasco
he
stood
silently
pondering
over
the
problem
the
manager
obsequiously
bowing
and
rubbing
his
hands
and
then
the
idea
for
which
he
was
hoping
flashed
into
his
mind
he
walked
to
the
wall
behind
the
sideboard
and
struck
it
sharply
it
rang
hollow
a
partition
he
asked
what
is
behind
it
anozzer
room
sair
a
private
room
same
as
show
it
to
the
ozzer
room
was
smaller
but
otherwise
similar
to
that
they
had
just
left
the
doors
of
the
two
rooms
were
beside
each
other
leading
on
to
the
same
passage
this
will
do
willis
declared
now
look
here
mr
manager
i
wish
to
overhear
the
conversation
of
your
customers
and
i
may
or
may
not
wish
to
arrest
them
you
will
show
them
up
and
give
them
lunch
exactly
as
you
have
arranged
some
officers
from
the
yard
and
myself
will
previously
have
hidden
ourselves
in
here
see
the
manager
nodded
in
the
meantime
i
shall
send
a
carpenter
and
have
a
hole
made
in
that
partition
between
the
two
rooms
a
hole
about
two
feet
by
one
behind
the
upper
part
of
that
picture
that
hangs
above
the
sideboard
do
you
understand
the
manager
wrung
his
hands
ach
he
cried
but
meine
zimmern
mine
rooms
zey
veel

deestroyed
your
rooms
will
be
none
the
worse
willis
declared
i
will
have
the
damage
made
good
and
i
shall
pay
you
reasonably
well
for
everything
you
not
lose
if
you
act
on
the
square
but
if
not
he
stared
aggressively
in
the
other
face
if
the
slightest
hint
of
my
plan
reaches
any
of
the
men
well
it
will
be
ten
years
at
it
shall
be
done
all
shall
happen
as
you
say
it
had
better
willis
rejoined
and
with
a
menacing
look
he
strode
out
of
the
restaurant
the
gresham
hotel
he
called
to
his
driver
as
he
reentered
his
taxi
his
manner
to
the
manageress
of
the
bedford
square
hotel
was
very
different
from
that
displayed
to
the
german
introducing
himself
as
an
inspector
from
the
yard
he
inquired
the
purpose
of
archer
call
without
hesitation
he
was
informed
the
distiller
had
engaged
a
private
for
a
business
interview
which
was
to
take
place
at
eleven
on
the
following
tuesday
between
a
miss
coburn
a
merriman
and
a
captain
beamish
so
far
so
good
thought
willis
exultingly
as
he
drove
off
walking
into
the
trap
i
shall
have
them
all
i
shall
have
them
in
a
at
the
yard
he
dismissed
his
taxi
and
on
reaching
his
room
he
found
the
letter
he
was
expecting
from
madeleine
it
contained
that
from
beamish
and
the
latter
ran
ferriby
yorks
saturday
dear
miss
coburn
have
just
received
your
letter
of
and
i
hasten
to
reply
i
am
deeply
grieved
to
learn
that
you
consider
yourself
badly
treated
by
the
members
of
the
syndicate
and
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
feel
positive
that
any
obligations
which
they
may
have
contracted
will
be
immediately
and
honorably
discharged
it
is
however
news
to
me
that
your
late
father
was
a
partner
as
i
always
imagined
that
he
held
his
position
as
i
do
my
own
namely
as
a
salaried
official
who
also
receives
a
bonus
based
on
the
profits
of
the
concern
with
regard
to
the
notes
you
have
found
on
the
operations
of
the
syndicate
it
is
obvious
that
these
must
be
capable
of
a
simple
explanation
as
there
was
nothing
in
the
operations
complicated
or
difficult
to
understand
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
fall
in
with
your
suggestion
that
we
should
meet
and
discuss
the
points
at
issue
and
i
would
suggest
on
tuesday
at
the
gresham
hotel
in
bedford
square
if
this
would
suit
you
with
kind
regards
yours
sincerely
walter
willis
smiled
as
he
read
this
effusion
it
was
really
quite
well
worded
and
left
the
door
open
for
any
action
which
the
syndicate
might
decide
on
ah
well
my
friend
he
thought
grimly
you
get
a
little
surprise
on
tuesday
you
find
miss
coburn
is
not
to
be
caught
as
easily
as
you
think
just
you
wait
and
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
willis
busied
himself
in
preparing
for
his
great
coup
first
he
went
down
again
to
eastbourne
via
brighton
and
coached
madeleine
and
merriman
in
the
part
they
were
to
play
in
the
coming
interview
next
he
superintended
the
making
of
the
hole
through
the
wall
dividing
the
two
private
rooms
at
the
cranbourne
street
restaurant
and
drilled
the
party
of
men
who
were
to
occupy
the
annex
to
his
unbounded
satisfaction
he
found
that
every
word
uttered
at
the
table
in
the
larger
room
was
audible
next
door
to
anyone
standing
at
the
aperture
then
he
detailed
two
picked
men
to
wait
within
call
of
the
private
room
at
the
gresham
during
the
interview
between
madeleine
and
beamish
finally
all
his
preparations
in
london
complete
he
returned
to
hull
and
set
himself
by
means
of
the
secret
telephone
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
affairs
of
the
syndicate
chapter
the
double
cross
inspector
willis
spent
the
saturday
before
the
fateful
tuesday
at
the
telephone
in
the
empty
cottage
nothing
of
interest
passed
over
the
wire
except
that
benson
informed
his
chief
that
he
had
had
a
telegram
from
beamish
saying
that
in
order
to
reach
ferriby
at
the
prearranged
hour
he
was
having
to
sail
without
a
full
cargo
of
props
and
that
the
two
men
went
over
again
the
various
trains
by
which
they
and
their
confederates
would
travel
to
london
both
items
pleased
willis
as
it
showed
him
that
the
plans
originally
made
were
being
adhered
to
on
monday
morning
as
the
critical
hour
of
his
coup
approached
he
became
restless
and
even
nervous
so
far
that
is
as
an
inspector
of
the
yard
on
duty
can
be
nervous
so
much
depended
on
the
results
of
the
next
day
and
a
half
his
own
fate
hung
in
the
balance
as
well
as
that
of
the
men
against
whom
he
had
pitted
himself
miss
coburn
and
merriman
too
would
be
profoundly
affected
however
the
affair
ended
while
to
his
department
and
even
to
the
nation
at
large
his
success
would
not
be
without
importance
he
determined
he
would
if
possible
see
the
various
members
of
the
gang
start
travelling
himself
in
the
train
with
archer
as
the
leader
and
the
man
most
urgently
benson
he
remembered
was
to
go
first
willis
therefore
haunted
the
paragon
station
watching
the
trains
leave
and
he
was
well
satisfied
when
he
saw
benson
get
on
board
the
by
means
of
a
word
of
explanation
and
the
passing
of
a
couple
of
shillings
he
induced
an
official
to
examine
the
traveller
ticket
which
proved
to
be
a
third
return
to
king
cross
beamish
and
bulla
were
to
travel
by
the
and
willis
carefully
disguised
as
a
fisherman
watched
them
arrive
separately
take
their
tickets
and
enter
the
train
beamish
travelled
first
and
bulla
third
and
again
the
inspector
had
their
tickets
examined
and
found
they
were
for
london
archer
was
to
leave
at
and
willis
intended
as
a
precautionary
measure
to
travel
up
with
him
and
keep
him
under
observation
still
in
his
fisherman
disguise
he
took
his
own
ticket
got
into
the
rear
of
the
train
and
kept
his
eye
on
the
platform
until
he
saw
archer
pass
suitcase
and
rug
in
hand
then
cautiously
looking
out
he
watched
the
other
get
into
the
through
coach
for
king
cross
as
the
train
ran
past
the
depot
at
ferriby
willis
observed
that
the
girondin
was
not
discharging
but
instead
was
loading
casks
of
some
kind
he
had
noted
on
the
previous
friday
when
he
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
that
some
wagons
of
these
casks
had
been
shunted
inside
the
enclosure
and
were
being
unloaded
by
the
syndicate
men
the
casks
looked
like
those
in
which
the
crude
oil
for
the
ship
diesel
engines
arrived
and
the
fact
that
she
was
loading
them
unemptied
he
presumed
them
unemptied
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
pumping
plant
on
the
wharf
was
out
of
order
the
ran
with
a
stop
at
goole
to
doncaster
where
the
through
carriage
was
shunted
on
to
one
of
the
great
expresses
from
the
north
more
from
force
of
habit
than
otherwise
willis
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
at
goole
to
watch
if
anyone
should
leave
archer
carriage
but
no
one
did
at
doncaster
willis
received
something
of
a
shock
as
his
train
drew
into
the
station
another
was
just
coming
out
and
he
idly
ran
his
eye
along
the
line
of
coaches
a
figure
in
the
corner
of
a
compartment
attracted
his
attention
it
seemed
vaguely
familiar
but
it
was
already
out
of
sight
before
the
inspector
realized
that
it
was
a
likeness
to
benson
that
had
struck
him
he
had
not
seen
the
man
face
and
at
once
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
with
the
careless
thought
that
everyone
has
his
double
a
moment
later
they
pulled
up
at
the
platform
here
again
he
put
out
his
head
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
archer
alight
and
evidently
leaving
his
suitcase
and
rug
to
keep
his
seat
move
slowly
down
the
platform
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
this
as
no
less
than
seventeen
minutes
elapsed
between
the
arrival
of
the
train
from
hull
and
the
departure
of
that
from
london
and
through
passengers
frequently
left
their
carriage
while
it
was
being
shunted
at
the
same
time
willis
unostentatiously
followed
and
presently
saw
archer
vanish
into
the
refreshment
room
he
took
up
a
position
where
he
had
a
good
view
of
the
door
and
waited
for
the
other
reappearance
but
the
distiller
was
in
no
hurry
ten
minutes
elapsed
and
still
he
made
no
sign
the
express
from
the
north
thundered
in
the
engine
hooked
off
and
shunting
began
the
train
was
due
out
at
and
now
the
hands
of
the
great
clock
pointed
to
willis
began
to
be
perturbed
had
he
missed
his
quarry
at
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
at
risk
of
meeting
archer
should
the
latter
at
that
moment
decide
to
leave
the
refreshment
room
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
glanced
in
and
then
he
breathed
freely
again
archer
was
sitting
at
a
table
sipping
what
looked
like
a
whisky
and
soda
as
willis
looked
he
saw
him
glance
up
at
the
clock
now
pointing
to
and
calmly
settle
himself
more
comfortably
in
his
chair
why
the
man
would
miss
the
train
willis
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
disappointment
had
an
impulse
to
run
over
and
remind
him
of
the
hour
at
which
it
left
but
he
controlled
himself
in
time
slipped
back
to
his
post
of
observation
and
took
up
his
watch
in
a
few
seconds
the
train
whistled
and
pulled
majestically
out
of
the
station
for
fifteen
minutes
willis
waited
and
then
he
saw
the
distiller
leave
the
refreshment
room
and
walk
slowly
down
the
platform
as
willis
followed
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
other
had
deliberately
allowed
his
train
to
start
without
him
though
what
his
motive
had
been
the
inspector
could
not
imagine
he
now
approached
the
and
apparently
bought
a
ticket
afterwards
turning
back
down
the
platform
willis
slipped
into
a
doorway
until
he
had
passed
then
hurrying
to
the
explained
who
he
was
and
asked
to
what
station
the
last
comer
had
booked
he
was
told
selby
and
he
retreated
exasperated
and
puzzled
beyond
words
what
could
archer
be
up
to
he
bought
a
and
began
to
study
the
possibilities
first
he
made
himself
clear
as
to
the
lie
of
the
land
the
main
line
of
the
great
east
coast
route
from
london
to
scotland
ran
almost
due
north
and
south
through
doncaster
eighteen
miles
to
the
north
was
selby
the
next
important
station
at
selby
a
line
running
east
and
west
crossed
the
other
leading
in
one
direction
to
leeds
and
the
west
in
the
other
to
hull
about
between
selby
and
hull
at
a
place
called
staddlethorpe
a
line
branched
off
and
ran
through
goole
to
doncaster
selby
staddlethorpe
and
doncaster
therefore
formed
a
railway
triangle
one
of
the
sides
of
which
produced
led
to
hull
from
this
it
followed
as
indeed
the
inspector
had
known
that
passengers
to
and
from
hull
had
two
points
of
connection
with
the
main
line
either
direct
to
selby
or
through
goole
to
doncaster
he
began
to
study
the
trains
the
first
northwards
was
the
express
from
king
cross
to
newcastle
it
left
doncaster
at
and
reached
selby
at
would
archer
travel
by
it
and
if
he
did
what
would
be
his
next
move
for
nearly
an
hour
willis
sat
huddled
up
in
the
corner
of
a
seat
his
eye
on
archer
in
the
distance
and
his
mind
wrestling
with
the
problem
for
nearly
an
hour
he
racked
his
brains
without
result
then
suddenly
a
devastating
idea
flashed
before
his
consciousness
leaving
him
rigid
with
dismay
for
a
moment
his
mind
refused
to
accept
so
disastrous
a
possibility
but
as
he
continued
to
think
over
it
he
found
that
one
puzzling
and
unrelated
fact
after
another
took
on
a
different
complexion
from
that
it
had
formerly
borne
that
moreover
it
dropped
into
place
and
became
part
of
a
connected
whole
to
the
north
stsaalethorpt
hull
leeds
ferriby
hassle
x
goole
x
dorcaster
from
london
he
saw
now
why
archer
could
not
discuss
madeleine
letter
over
the
telephone
but
was
able
to
arrange
in
that
way
for
the
interview
with
beamish
he
understood
why
archer
standing
at
his
study
window
had
mentioned
the
call
at
eleven
next
morning
he
realized
that
amendment
was
probably
arranged
by
archer
on
the
previous
evening
he
saw
why
the
girondin
had
left
the
lesque
without
her
full
cargo
and
why
she
was
loading
barrels
at
ferriby
he
knew
who
it
was
he
had
seen
passing
in
the
other
train
as
his
own
reached
doncaster
and
he
grasped
the
reason
for
archer
visit
to
selby
in
a
word
he
saw
he
had
been
hoaxed
fooled
carefully
systematically
and
at
every
point
while
he
had
been
congratulating
himself
on
the
completeness
with
which
the
conspirators
had
been
walking
into
his
net
he
had
in
reality
been
caught
in
theirs
he
had
been
like
a
child
in
their
hands
they
had
evidently
been
watching
and
countering
his
every
step
he
saw
now
that
his
tapping
of
the
secret
telephone
must
have
been
discovered
and
that
his
enemies
had
used
their
discovery
to
mislead
him
they
must
have
recognized
that
madeleine
letter
was
inspired
by
himself
and
read
his
motives
in
making
her
send
it
they
had
then
used
the
telephone
to
make
him
believe
they
were
falling
into
his
trap
while
their
real
plans
were
settled
in
archer
study
what
those
plans
were
he
believed
he
now
understood
there
would
be
no
meetings
in
london
on
the
following
day
the
meetings
were
designed
to
bring
him
willis
to
the
metropolis
and
keep
him
there
by
tomorrow
the
gang
convinced
that
discovery
was
imminent
would
be
aboard
the
girondin
and
on
the
high
seas
they
were
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
doing
a
therefore
of
necessity
the
girondin
would
load
barrelled
oil
to
drive
her
to
some
country
where
scotland
yard
detectives
did
not
flourish
and
where
extradition
laws
were
of
no
account
therefore
she
must
return
light
or
he
suspected
empty
as
there
would
be
no
time
to
unload
moreover
a
reason
for
this
lightness
must
be
given
him
lest
he
should
notice
the
ship
sitting
high
out
of
the
water
and
suspect
and
he
now
knew
that
it
was
really
benson
that
he
had
seen
returning
to
ferriby
via
goole
and
that
archer
was
doing
the
same
via
selby
he
looked
up
the
trains
from
selby
to
ferriby
there
was
only
one
it
left
selby
at
minutes
after
the
doncaster
train
arrived
there
and
reached
ferriby
at
it
was
now
getting
on
towards
eight
he
had
nearly
two
and
a
half
hours
to
make
his
plans
though
willis
was
a
little
slow
in
thought
he
was
prompt
in
action
feeling
sure
that
archer
would
indeed
travel
by
the
to
selby
he
relaxed
his
watch
and
went
to
the
telephone
call
office
there
he
rang
up
the
police
station
at
selby
asking
for
a
man
and
two
constables
to
meet
him
at
the
train
to
make
an
arrest
also
he
asked
for
a
fast
car
to
be
engaged
to
take
him
immediately
to
ferriby
he
then
called
up
the
police
in
hull
and
had
a
long
talk
with
the
superintendent
finally
it
was
arranged
that
a
sergeant
and
twelve
men
were
to
meet
him
on
the
shore
at
the
back
of
the
signal
cabin
near
the
ferriby
depot
with
a
boat
and
a
grappling
ladder
for
getting
aboard
the
girondin
this
done
willis
hurried
back
to
the
platform
reaching
it
just
as
the
came
in
he
watched
archer
get
on
board
and
then
himself
entered
another
compartment
at
selby
the
quarry
alighted
and
passed
along
the
platform
towards
the
willis
police
training
instantly
revealed
to
him
the
man
and
him
he
instructed
to
follow
archer
and
learn
to
what
station
he
booked
in
a
few
moments
the
man
returned
to
say
it
was
ferriby
then
calling
up
the
two
constables
the
four
officers
followed
the
distiller
into
the
waiting
room
where
he
had
taken
cover
willis
walked
up
to
him
archibald
charles
archer
he
said
impressively
i
am
inspector
willis
of
scotland
yard
i
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
on
a
charge
of
murdering
francis
coburn
in
a
cab
in
london
on
september
last
i
have
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
say
may
be
used
in
for
a
moment
the
distiller
seemed
so
overwhelmed
with
surprise
as
to
be
incapable
of
movement
and
before
he
could
pull
himself
together
there
was
a
click
and
handcuffs
gleamed
on
his
wrists
then
his
eyes
blazed
and
with
the
inarticulate
roar
of
a
wild
beast
he
flung
himself
wildly
on
willis
and
manacled
as
he
was
attempted
to
seize
his
throat
but
the
struggle
was
brief
in
a
moment
the
three
other
men
had
torn
him
off
and
he
stood
glaring
at
his
adversary
and
uttering
savage
curses
you
look
after
him
sergeant
willis
directed
a
little
breathlessly
as
he
tried
to
straighten
the
remnants
of
his
tie
i
must
go
on
to
a
powerful
car
was
waiting
outside
the
station
and
willis
jumping
in
offered
the
driver
an
extra
pound
if
he
was
at
ferriby
within
fifty
minutes
he
reckoned
the
distance
was
about
miles
and
he
thought
he
should
maintain
at
average
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
the
night
was
intensely
dark
as
the
big
vehicle
swung
out
of
selby
eastward
bound
a
slight
wind
blew
in
from
the
east
bearing
a
damp
searching
cold
more
trying
than
frost
willis
who
had
left
his
coat
in
the
london
train
shivered
as
he
drew
the
one
rug
the
vehicle
contained
up
round
his
shoulders
the
road
to
howden
was
broad
and
smooth
and
the
car
made
fine
going
but
at
howden
the
main
road
turned
north
and
speed
on
the
comparatively
inferior
cross
roads
to
ferriby
had
to
be
reduced
but
willis
was
not
dissatisfied
with
their
progress
when
at
minutes
after
leaving
selby
they
pulled
up
in
the
ferriby
lane
not
far
from
the
distillery
and
opposite
the
railway
signal
cabin
having
arranged
with
the
driver
to
run
up
to
the
main
road
wait
there
until
he
heard
four
blasts
on
the
girondin
horn
and
then
make
for
the
syndicate
depot
the
inspector
dismounted
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
railway
fence
crossed
the
rails
and
descended
the
low
embankment
on
the
river
side
a
moment
later
just
as
he
reached
the
shore
the
form
of
a
man
loomed
up
dimly
through
the
darkness
who
is
there
asked
willis
softly
constable
jones
sir
the
figure
answered
is
that
inspector
willis
sergeant
hobbs
is
here
with
the
willis
followed
the
other
for
fifty
yards
along
the
beach
until
they
came
on
two
boats
each
containing
half
a
dozen
policemen
it
was
still
very
dark
and
the
wind
blew
cold
and
raw
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
lapping
of
the
waves
on
the
shingle
willis
felt
that
the
night
was
ideal
for
his
purpose
there
was
enough
noise
from
wind
and
water
to
muffle
any
sounds
that
the
men
might
make
in
getting
aboard
the
girondin
but
not
enough
to
prevent
him
overhearing
any
conversation
which
might
be
in
progress
we
have
just
got
here
this
minute
sir
the
sergeant
said
i
hope
we
have
kept
you
just
arrived
myself
willis
returned
you
have
twelve
picked
men
yes
armed
yes
good
i
need
not
remind
you
all
not
to
fire
except
as
a
last
resort
what
arrangements
have
you
made
for
boarding
we
have
a
ladder
with
hooks
at
the
top
for
catching
on
the
your
oars
muffled
yes
very
well
now
listen
and
see
that
you
are
clear
about
what
you
are
to
do
when
we
reach
the
ship
get
your
ladder
into
position
and
go
up
you
and
the
men
follow
keep
beside
me
sergeant
we
overhear
what
we
can
when
i
give
the
signal
rush
in
and
arrest
the
whole
gang
do
you
follow
yes
then
let
us
get
under
they
pushed
off
passing
like
phantoms
over
the
dark
water
the
ship
carried
a
riding
light
to
which
they
steered
she
was
lying
willis
knew
bow
upstream
the
tide
was
flowing
and
when
they
were
close
by
they
ceased
rowing
and
drifted
down
on
to
her
stern
there
the
leading
boat
dropped
in
beneath
her
counter
and
the
bowman
made
the
painter
fast
to
her
rudder
post
the
second
boat
painter
was
attached
to
the
stern
of
the
first
and
the
current
swung
both
alongside
the
men
fending
off
allowed
their
craft
to
come
into
place
without
sound
the
ladder
was
raised
and
hooked
on
and
willis
climbing
up
stealthily
raised
his
head
above
the
taffrail
the
port
side
of
the
ship
was
as
on
previous
occasions
in
complete
darkness
and
willis
jerked
the
ladder
as
a
signal
to
the
others
to
follow
him
in
a
few
seconds
the
fourteen
men
stood
like
shadows
on
the
lower
deck
then
willis
tiptoeing
forward
began
to
climb
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
deck
just
as
hilliard
had
done
some
four
months
earlier
as
on
that
occasion
the
starboard
side
of
the
ship
next
the
wharf
was
dimly
lighted
up
a
light
also
showed
in
the
window
of
the
cabin
from
which
issued
the
sound
of
voices
willis
posted
his
men
in
two
groups
at
either
end
of
the
cabin
so
that
at
a
given
signal
they
could
rush
round
in
opposite
directions
and
reach
the
door
then
he
and
the
sergeant
crept
forward
and
put
their
ears
to
the
window
this
time
though
the
glass
was
hooked
back
as
before
the
curtain
was
pulled
fully
across
the
opening
so
that
the
men
could
see
nothing
and
only
partially
hear
what
was
said
willis
therefore
reached
in
and
very
gradually
pulled
it
a
little
aside
fortunately
no
one
noticed
the
movement
and
the
talk
continued
uninterruptedly
the
inspector
could
now
see
in
five
men
were
squeezed
round
the
tiny
table
beamish
and
bulla
sat
along
one
side
directly
facing
him
at
the
end
was
fox
the
remaining
two
had
their
backs
to
the
window
and
were
the
inspector
believed
raymond
and
henri
before
each
man
was
a
long
tumbler
of
whisky
and
soda
and
a
box
of
cigars
lay
on
the
table
all
seemed
nervous
and
excited
indeed
as
if
under
an
intolerable
strain
and
kept
fidgeting
and
looking
at
their
watches
conversation
was
evidently
maintained
with
an
effort
as
a
thing
necessary
to
keep
them
from
a
complete
breakdown
raymond
was
speaking
and
you
saw
him
come
out
he
was
asking
yes
fox
answered
he
came
out
sort
of
stealthy
and
looked
around
i
did
know
who
it
was
then
but
i
knew
no
one
had
any
business
in
the
cottage
at
that
hour
so
i
followed
him
to
ferriby
station
i
saw
his
face
by
the
lamps
and
you
knew
him
no
but
i
recognized
him
as
having
been
around
with
that
excise
inspector
and
i
guessed
he
was
on
to
oui
oui
yes
the
frenchman
interrogated
well
naturally
i
told
the
chief
he
knew
who
it
bien
there
is
not
how
do
you
say
flies
on
archer
pas
and
then
the
chief
guessed
who
it
was
from
the
captain
fox
nodded
his
head
at
beamish
you
met
him
eh
captain
he
stood
me
a
drink
the
big
man
answered
but
what
he
did
it
for
i
do
but
how
did
he
get
wise
to
the
telephone
bulla
rumbled
ca
find
out
fox
replied
but
it
showed
he
was
wise
to
the
whole
affair
then
there
was
that
letter
from
miss
coburn
that
gave
the
show
away
because
there
could
have
been
no
papers
like
she
said
and
she
could
have
discovered
anything
then
that
she
had
known
at
the
clearing
archer
put
morton
on
to
it
and
he
found
that
this
willis
went
down
to
eastbourne
one
night
about
two
days
before
the
letter
came
so
that
was
that
then
he
had
me
watch
for
him
going
to
the
telephone
and
he
has
fooled
him
about
proper
i
guess
he
in
london
now
arranging
to
arrest
us
all
bulla
chuckled
fatly
as
you
say
he
nodded
at
raymond
there
ai
no
flies
on
archer
what
i
always
thought
a
lot
of
archer
beamish
remarked
but
i
never
thought
so
much
of
him
as
that
night
we
drew
lots
for
who
should
put
coburn
out
of
the
way
when
he
drew
the
long
taper
he
never
as
much
as
turned
a
hair
that
the
last
time
we
had
a
full
meeting
and
we
never
reckoned
that
this
would
be
the
at
this
moment
a
train
passed
going
towards
hull
there
his
train
fox
cried
he
should
be
here
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
from
the
station
raymond
inquired
about
fifteen
minutes
captain
beamish
answered
we
time
enough
making
a
the
men
showed
more
and
more
nervousness
but
the
talk
dragged
on
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
suddenly
from
the
wharf
sounded
the
approaching
footsteps
of
a
running
man
he
crossed
the
gangway
and
raced
up
the
ladder
to
the
captain
cabin
the
others
sprang
to
their
feet
as
the
door
opened
and
benson
appeared
he
has
come
he
cried
excitedly
i
watched
at
the
station
and
he
did
get
out
consternation
showed
on
every
face
and
beamish
swore
bitterly
there
was
a
variety
of
comments
and
conjectures
there
no
other
train
only
the
express
it
does
stop
here
but
it
stops
at
hassle
on
notice
to
the
he
may
have
missed
the
connection
at
selby
fox
suggested
in
that
case
he
would
beamish
spoke
authoritatively
i
wish
benson
you
would
go
and
ring
up
the
central
and
see
if
there
has
been
any
willis
whispered
to
the
sergeant
who
beckoning
to
two
of
his
men
crept
hurriedly
down
the
port
ladder
to
the
lower
deck
in
a
moment
benson
followed
down
the
starboard
or
lighted
side
willis
listened
breathlessly
above
heard
what
he
was
expecting
a
sudden
scuffle
a
muffled
cry
a
faint
click
and
then
silence
he
peeped
through
the
porthole
fox
was
expounding
his
theory
about
the
railway
connections
and
none
of
those
within
had
heard
the
sounds
presently
the
sergeant
returned
with
his
men
trussed
him
up
to
the
davit
pole
he
breathed
in
the
inspector
ear
he
wo
give
no
willis
nodded
contentedly
that
was
one
out
of
the
way
out
of
six
and
he
had
fourteen
on
his
side
meanwhile
the
men
in
the
cabin
continued
anxiously
discussing
their
leader
absence
until
after
a
few
minutes
beamish
swore
irritably
curse
that
fool
benson
he
growled
what
the
blazes
is
keeping
him
all
this
time
i
had
better
go
and
hurry
him
up
if
they
got
hold
of
archer
it
time
we
were
out
of
willis
hand
closed
on
the
sergeant
arm
same
thing
again
but
with
three
men
he
whispered
the
four
had
hardly
disappeared
down
the
port
ladder
when
beamish
left
his
cabin
and
began
to
descend
the
starboard
willis
felt
that
the
crisis
was
upon
him
he
whispered
to
the
remaining
constables
who
closed
in
round
the
cabin
door
then
grasped
his
revolver
and
stood
tense
suddenly
a
wild
commotion
arose
on
the
lower
deck
there
was
a
warning
shout
from
beamish
instantly
muffled
a
tramp
of
feet
a
pistol
shot
and
sounds
of
a
violent
struggle
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
cabin
the
men
gazing
at
each
other
with
consternation
on
their
faces
then
bulla
yelled
copped
by
heck
and
with
an
agility
hardly
credible
in
a
man
of
his
years
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
sprang
out
of
the
cabin
instantly
he
was
seized
by
three
constables
and
the
four
went
swinging
and
lurching
across
the
deck
bulla
fighting
desperately
to
turn
his
weapon
on
his
assailants
at
the
same
moment
willis
leaped
to
the
door
and
with
his
automatic
levelled
shouted
hands
up
all
of
you
you
are
covered
from
every
quarter
henri
and
fox
who
were
next
the
door
obeyed
as
if
in
a
stupor
but
raymond
hand
flew
out
and
a
bullet
whistled
past
the
head
instantly
willis
fired
and
with
a
scream
the
frenchman
staggered
back
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
for
the
remaining
constables
to
dash
in
under
the
inspector
pistol
and
handcuff
the
two
men
in
the
cabin
and
willis
then
turned
to
see
how
the
contests
on
deck
were
faring
but
these
also
were
over
both
beamish
and
bulla
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
numbers
had
been
secured
the
inspector
next
turned
to
examine
raymond
his
shot
had
been
well
aimed
the
bullet
had
entered
the
base
of
the
man
right
thumb
and
passed
out
through
his
wrist
his
life
was
not
in
danger
but
it
would
be
many
a
long
day
before
he
would
again
fire
a
revolver
four
blasts
on
the
girondin
horn
recalled
willis
car
and
when
some
three
hours
later
the
last
batch
of
prisoners
was
safely
lodged
in
the
hull
police
station
willis
began
to
feel
that
the
end
of
his
labors
was
at
last
coming
in
sight
the
arrests
supplied
the
inspector
with
fresh
material
on
which
to
work
as
a
result
of
his
careful
investigation
of
the
movements
of
the
prisoners
during
the
previous
three
years
the
entire
history
of
the
syndicate
was
unravelled
as
well
as
the
details
of
murder
it
seemed
that
the
original
idea
of
the
fraud
was
raymond
he
looked
round
for
a
likely
english
partner
selected
archer
broached
the
subject
to
him
and
found
him
willing
to
go
in
soon
from
his
dominating
personality
archer
became
the
leader
details
were
worked
out
and
the
necessary
confederates
carefully
chosen
beamish
and
bulla
went
in
as
partners
the
four
being
bound
together
by
their
joint
liability
the
other
three
members
were
tools
over
whom
the
quartet
had
obtained
some
hold
in
coburn
case
archer
learned
of
the
defalcations
in
time
to
make
the
erring
cashier
his
victim
he
met
the
deficit
in
return
for
a
signed
confession
of
guilt
and
an
i
u
for
a
sum
that
would
have
enabled
the
distiller
to
sell
the
other
up
and
ruin
his
home
and
his
future
an
incompletely
erased
address
in
a
pocket
diary
belonging
to
beamish
led
willis
to
a
small
shop
on
the
south
side
of
london
where
he
discovered
an
assistant
who
had
sold
a
square
of
black
serge
to
two
men
about
the
time
of
coburn
murder
the
salesman
remembered
the
transaction
because
his
customers
had
been
unable
to
describe
what
they
wanted
otherwise
than
by
the
word
cloth
which
was
not
the
technical
name
foy
any
of
his
commodities
the
fabric
found
in
the
cab
was
identical
to
that
on
the
roll
this
man
stated
he
had
used
moreover
he
identified
beamish
and
bulla
as
the
purchasers
willis
had
a
routine
search
made
of
the
restaurants
of
soho
and
at
last
found
that
in
which
the
conspirators
had
held
their
meetings
previous
to
the
murder
there
had
been
two
at
the
first
so
willis
learned
from
the
description
given
by
the
proprietor
coburn
had
been
present
but
not
at
the
second
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
he
was
unable
to
find
the
shop
at
which
the
pistol
had
been
bought
but
he
suspected
the
transaction
had
been
carried
out
by
one
of
the
other
members
of
the
gang
in
order
as
far
as
possible
to
share
the
responsibility
for
the
crime
on
the
girondin
was
found
the
false
bulkhead
in
bulla
cabin
behind
which
was
placed
the
hidden
brandy
tank
the
connection
for
the
shore
pipe
was
concealed
behind
the
back
of
the
engineer
basin
which
moved
forward
by
means
of
a
secret
spring
on
the
girondin
was
also
found
something
over
pounds
mostly
in
brazilian
notes
and
benson
admitted
later
that
the
plan
had
been
to
scuttle
the
girondin
off
the
coast
of
bahia
take
to
the
boats
and
row
ashore
at
night
remaining
in
brazil
at
least
till
the
hue
and
cry
had
died
down
but
instead
all
seven
men
received
heavy
sentences
archer
paid
for
his
crimes
with
his
life
the
others
got
terms
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
years
each
the
managers
of
the
licensed
houses
in
hull
were
believed
to
have
been
in
ignorance
of
the
larger
fraud
and
to
have
dealt
privately
and
individually
with
archer
and
they
and
their
accomplices
escaped
with
lighter
penalties
the
mysterious
morton
proved
to
be
a
private
detective
employed
by
archer
he
swore
positively
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
real
nature
of
the
syndicate
operations
and
though
the
judge
strictures
on
his
conduct
were
severe
no
evidence
could
be
found
against
him
and
he
was
not
brought
to
trial
inspector
willis
got
his
desired
promotion
out
of
the
case
and
there
was
someone
else
who
got
more
about
a
month
after
the
trial
in
the
holy
trinity
church
eastbourne
a
wedding
was
solemnized
seymour
merriman
and
madeleine
coburn
were
united
in
the
holy
bonds
of
matrimony
and
hilliard
assisting
as
best
man
could
not
refrain
from
whispering
in
his
friend
ear
as
they
turned
to
leave
the
vestry
three
cheers
for
the
syndicate
