the
autobiography
of
helen
keller
is
unquestionably
one
of
the
most
remarkable
records
ever
published
this
book
is
a
human
document
of
intense
interest
and
without
a
parallel
we
suppose
in
the
history
of
literature
miss
keller
autobiography
well
written
and
full
of
practical
interest
in
all
sides
of
life
literary
artistic
and
social
records
an
extraordinary
victory
over
physical
disabilities
this
book
is
a
record
of
the
miraculous
no
one
can
read
it
without
being
profoundly
touched
by
the
patience
and
devotion
which
brought
the
blind
child
into
touch
with
human
life
without
being
filled
with
wonder
at
the

my
dear

of
many
years
preface
the
essays
and
the
poem
in
this
book
appeared
originally
in
the
century
magazine
the
essays
under
the
titles
a
chat
about
the
hand
sense
and
sensibility
and
my
dreams
gilder
suggested
the
articles
and
i
thank
him
for
his
kind
interest
and
encouragement
but
he
must
also
accept
the
responsibility
which
goes
with
my
gratitude
for
it
is
owing
to
his
wish
and
that
of
other
editors
that
i
talk
so
much
about
myself
every
book
is
in
a
sense
autobiographical
but
while
other
creatures
are
permitted
at
least
to
seem
to
change
the
subject
apparently
nobody
cares
what
i
think
of
the
tariff
the
conservation
of
our
natural
resources
or
the
conflicts
which
revolve
about
the
name
of
dreyfus
if
i
offer
to
reform
the
education
system
of
the
world
my
editorial
friends
say
that
is
interesting
but
will
you
please
tell
us
what
idea
you
had
of
goodness
and
beauty
when
you
were
six
years
old
first
they
ask
me
to
tell
the
life
of
the
child
who
is
mother
to
the
woman
then
they
make
me
my
own
daughter
and
ask
for
an
account
of
sensations
finally
i
am
requested
to
write
about
my
dreams
and
thus
i
become
an
anachronical
grandmother
for
it
is
the
special
privilege
of
old
age
to
relate
dreams
the
editors
are
so
kind
that
they
are
no
doubt
right
in
thinking
that
nothing
i
have
to
say
about
the
affairs
of
the
universe
would
be
interesting
but
until
they
give
me
opportunity
to
write
about
matters
that
are
the
world
must
go
on
uninstructed
and
unreformed
and
i
can
only
do
my
best
with
the
one
small
subject
upon
which
i
am
allowed
to
discourse
in
the
chant
of
darkness
i
did
not
intend
to
set
up
as
a
poet
i
thought
i
was
writing
prose
except
for
the
magnificent
passage
from
job
which
i
was
paraphrasing
but
this
part
seemed
to
my
friends
to
separate
itself
from
the
exposition

i
made
it

the
little

next
door
the
seeing
hand
i
the
seeing
hand
i
have
just
touched
my
dog
he
was
rolling
on
the
grass
with
pleasure
in
every
muscle
and
limb
i
wanted
to
catch
a
picture
of
him
in
my
fingers
and
i
touched
him
as
lightly
as
i
would
cobwebs
but
lo
his
fat
body
revolved
stiffened
and
solidified
into
an
upright
position
and
his
tongue
gave
my
hand
a
lick
he
pressed
close
to
me
as
if
he
were
fain
to
crowd
himself
into
my
hand
he
loved
it
with
his
tail
with
his
paw
with
his
tongue
if
he
could
speak
i
believe
he
would
say
with
me
that
paradise
is
attained
by
touch
for
in
touch
is
all
love
and
intelligence
this
small
incident
started
me
on
a
chat
about
hands
and
if
my
chat
is
fortunate
i
have
to
thank
my
in
any
case
it
is
pleasant
to
have
something
to
talk
about
that
no
one
else
has
monopolized
it
is
like
making
a
new
path
in
the
trackless
woods
blazing
the
trail
where
no
foot
has
pressed
before
i
am
glad
to
take
you
by
the
hand
and
lead
you
along
an
untrodden
way
into
a
world
where
the
hand
is
supreme
but
at
the
very
outset
we
encounter
a
difficulty
you
are
so
accustomed
to
light
i
fear
you
will
stumble
when
i
try
to
guide
you
through
the
land
of
darkness
and
silence
the
blind
are
not
supposed
to
be
the
best
of
guides
still
though
i
can
not
warrant
not
to
lose
you
i
promise
that
you
shall
not
be
led
into
fire
or
water
or
fall
into
a
deep
pit
if
you
will
follow
me
patiently
you
will
find
that
there
a
sound
so
fine
nothing
lives
it
and
silence
and
that
there
is
more
meant
in
things
than
meets
the
eye
my
hand
is
to
me
what
your
hearing
and
sight
together
are
to
you
in
large
measure
we
travel
the
same
highways
read
the
same
books
speak
the
same
language
yet
our
experiences
are
different
all
my
comings
and
goings
turn
on
the
hand
as
on
a
pivot
it
is
the
hand
that
binds
me
to
the
world
of
men
and
women
the
hand
is
my
feeler
with
which
i
reach
through
isolation
and
darkness
and
seize
every
pleasure
every
activity
that
my
fingers
encounter
with
the
dropping
of
a
little
word
from
another
hand
into
mine
a
slight
flutter
of
the
fingers
began
the
intelligence
the
joy
the
fullness
of
my
life
like
job
i
feel
as
if
a
hand
had
made
me
fashioned
me
together
round
about
and
moulded
my
very
soul
in
all
my
experiences
and
thoughts
i
am
conscious
of
a
hand
whatever
moves
me
whatever
thrills
me
is
as
a
hand
that
touches
me
in
the
dark
and
that
touch
is
my
reality
you
might
as
well
say
that
a
sight
which
makes
you
glad
or
a
blow
which
brings
the
stinging
tears
to
your
eyes
is
unreal
as
to
say
that
those
impressions
are
unreal
which
i
have
accumulated
by
means
of
touch
the
delicate
tremble
of
a
wings
in
my
hand
the
soft
petals
of
violets
curling
in
the
cool
folds
of
their
leaves
or
lifting
sweetly
out
of
the
the
clear
firm
outline
of
face
and
limb
the
smooth
arch
of
a
horse
neck
and
the
velvety
touch
of
his
nose
all
these
and
a
thousand
resultant
combinations
which
take
shape
in
my
mind
constitute
my
world
ideas
make
the
world
we
live
in
and
impressions
furnish
ideas
my
world
is
built
of
devoid
of
physical
colour
and
sound
but
without
colour
and
sound
it
breathes
and
throbs
with
life
every
object
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
tactual
qualities
which
combined
in
countless
ways
give
me
a
sense
of
power
of
beauty
or
of
incongruity
for
with
my
hands
i
can
feel
the
comic
as
well
as
the
beautiful
in
the
outward
appearance
of
things
remember
that
you
dependent
on
your
sight
do
not
realize
how
many
things
are
tangible
all
palpable
things
are
mobile
or
rigid
solid
or
liquid
big
or
small
warm
or
cold
and
these
qualities
are
variously
modified
the
coolness
of
a
rounding
into
bloom
is
different
from
the
coolness
of
an
evening
wind
in
summer
and
different
again
from
the
coolness
of
the
rain
that
soaks
into
the
hearts
of
growing
things
and
gives
them
life
and
body
the
velvet
of
the
rose
is
not
that
of
a
ripe
peach
or
of
a
baby
dimpled
cheek
the
hardness
of
the
rock
is
to
the
hardness
of
wood
what
a
deep
bass
is
to
a
woman
voice
when
it
is
low
what
i
call
beauty
i
find
in
certain
combinations
of
all
these
qualities
and
is
largely
derived
from
the
flow
of
curved
and
straight
lines
which
is
over
all
things
what
does
the
straight
line
mean
to
you
i
think
you
will
ask
it
several
things
it
symbolizes
duty
it
seems
to
have
the
quality
of
inexorableness
that
duty
has
when
i
have
something
to
do
that
must
not
be
set
aside
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
forward
in
a
straight
line
bound
to
arrive
somewhere
or
go
on
forever
without
swerving
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
that
is
what
it
means
to
escape
this
moralizing
you
should
ask
how
does
the
straight
line
feel
it
feels
as
i
suppose
it
looks
straight
a
dull
thought
drawn
out
endlessly
eloquence
to
the
touch
resides
not
in
straight
lines
but
in
unstraight
lines
or
in
many
curved
and
straight
lines
together
they
appear
and
disappear
are
now
deep
now
shallow
now
broken
off
or
lengthened
or
swelling
they
rise
and
sink
beneath
my
fingers
they
are
full
of
sudden
starts
and
pauses
and
their
variety
is
inexhaustible
and
wonderful
so
you
see
i
am
not
shut
out
from
the
region
of
the
beautiful
though
my
hand
can
not
perceive
the
brilliant
colours
in
the
sunset
or
on
the
mountain
or
reach
into
the
blue
depths
of
the
sky
physics
tells
me
that
i
am
well
off
in
a
world
which
i
am
told
knows
neither
cold
nor
sound
but
is
made
in
terms
of
size
shape
and
inherent
qualities
for
at
least
every
object
appears
to
my
fingers
standing
solidly
right
side
up
and
is
not
an
inverted
image
on
the
retina
which
i
understand
your
brain
is
at
infinite
though
unconscious
labour
to
set
back
on
its
feet
a
tangible
object
passes
complete
into
my
brain
with
the
warmth
of
life
upon
it
and
occupies
the
same
place
that
it
does
in
space
for
without
egotism
the
mind
is
as
large
as
the
universe
when
i
think
of
hills
i
think
of
the
upward
strength
i
tread
upon
when
water
is
the
object
of
my
thought
i
feel
the
cool
shock
of
the
plunge
and
the
quick
yielding
of
the
waves
that
crisp
and
curl
and
ripple
about
my
body
the
pleasing
changes
of
rough
and
smooth
pliant
and
rigid
curved
and
straight
in
the
bark
and
branches
of
a
tree
give
the
truth
to
my
hand
the
immovable
rock
with
its
juts
and
warped
surface
bends
beneath
my
fingers
into
all
manner
of
grooves
and
hollows
the
bulge
of
a
watermelon
and
the
rotundities
of
squashes
that
sprout
bud
and
ripen
in
that
strange
garden
planted
somewhere
behind
my
are
the
ludicrous
in
my
tactual
memory
and
imagination
my
fingers
are
tickled
to
delight
by
the
soft
ripple
of
a
baby
laugh
and
find
amusement
in
the
lusty
crow
of
the
barnyard
autocrat
once
i
had
a
pet
rooster
that
used
to
perch
on
my
knee
and
stretch
his
neck
and
crow
a
bird
in
my
hand
was
then
worth
two
in
the
barnyard
my
fingers
can
not
of
course
get
the
impression
of
a
large
whole
at
a
glance
but
i
feel
the
parts
and
my
mind
puts
them
together
i
move
around
my
house
touching
object
after
object
in
order
before
i
can
form
an
idea
of
the
entire
house
in
other
people
houses
i
can
touch
only
what
is
shown
to
me
the
chief
objects
of
interest
carvings
on
the
wall
or
a
curious
architectural
feature
exhibited
like
the
family
album
therefore
a
house
with
which
i
am
not
familiar
has
for
me
at
first
no
general
effect
or
harmony
of
detail
it
is
not
a
complete
conception
but
a
collection
of
which
as
they
come
to
me
are
disconnected
and
isolated
but
my
mind
is
full
of
associations
sensations
theories
and
with
them
it
constructs
the
house
the
process
reminds
me
of
the
building
of
solomon
temple
where
was
neither
saw
nor
hammer
nor
any
tool
heard
while
the
stones
were
being
laid
one
upon
another
the
silent
worker
is
imagination
which
decrees
reality
out
of
chaos
without
imagination
what
a
poor
thing
my
world
would
be
my
garden
would
be
a
silent
patch
of
earth
strewn
with
sticks
of
a
variety
of
shapes
and
smells
but
when
the
eye
of
my
mind
is
opened
to
its
beauty
the
bare
ground
brightens
beneath
my
feet
and
the
bursts
into
leaf
and
the
shakes
its
fragrance
everywhere
i
know
how
budding
trees
look
and
i
enter
into
the
amorous
joy
of
the
mating
birds
and
this
is
the
miracle
of
imagination
twofold
is
the
miracle
when
through
my
fingers
my
imagination
reaches
forth
and
meets
the
imagination
of
an
artist
which
he
has
embodied
in
a
sculptured
form
although
compared
with
the
mobile
face
of
a
friend
the
marble
is
cold
and
pulseless
and
unresponsive
yet
it
is
beautiful
to
my
hand
its
flowing
curves
and
bendings
are
a
real
pleasure
only
breath
is
wanting
but
under
the
spell
of
the
imagination
the
marble
thrills
and
becomes
the
divine
reality
of
the
ideal
imagination
puts
a
sentiment
into
every
line
and
curve
and
the
statue
in
my
touch
is
indeed
the
goddess
herself
who
breathes
and
moves
and
enchants
it
is
true
however
that
some
sculptures
even
recognized
masterpieces
do
not
please
my
hand
when
i
touch
what
there
is
of
the
winged
victory
it
reminds
me
at
first
of
a
headless
limbless
dream
that
flies
towards
me
in
an
unrestful
sleep
the
garments
of
the
victory
thrust
stiffly
out
behind
and
do
not
resemble
garments
that
i
have
felt
flying
fluttering
folding
spreading
in
the
wind
but
imagination
fulfils
these
imperfections
and
straightway
the
victory
becomes
a
powerful
and
spirited
figure
with
the
sweep
of
in
her
robes
and
the
splendour
of
conquest
in
her
wings
i
find
in
a
beautiful
statue
perfection
of
bodily
form
the
qualities
of
balance
and
completeness
the
minerva
hung
with
a
web
of
poetical
allusion
gives
me
a
sense
of
exhilaration
that
is
almost
physical
and
i
like
the
luxuriant
wavy
hair
of
bacchus
and
apollo
and
the
wreath
of
ivy
so
suggestive
of
pagan
holidays
so
imagination
crowns
the
experience
of
my
hands
and
they
learned
their
cunning
from
the
wise
hand
of
another
which
itself
guided
by
imagination
led
me
safely
in
paths
that
i
knew
not
made
darkness
light
before
me
and
made
crooked
ways
straight
the
hands
of
others
ii
the
hands
of
others
the
warmth
and
protectiveness
of
the
hand
are
most
homefelt
to
me
who
have
always
looked
to
it
for
aid
and
joy
i
understand
perfectly
how
the
psalmist
can
lift
up
his
voice
with
strength
and
gladness
singing
i
put
my
trust
in
the
lord
at
all
times
and
his
hand
shall
uphold
me
and
i
shall
dwell
in
safety
in
the
strength
of
the
human
hand
too
there
is
something
divine
i
am
told
that
the
glance
of
a
beloved
eye
thrills
one
from
a
distance
but
there
is
no
distance
in
the
touch
of
a
beloved
hand
even
the
letters
i
receive
are
kind
letters
that
betray
the
heart
deep
history
in
which
we
feel
the
presence
of
a
hand
it
is
interesting
to
observe
the
differences
in
the
hands
of
people
they
show
all
kinds
of
vitality
energy
stillness
and
cordiality
i
never
realized
how
living
the
hand
is
until
i
saw
those
chill
plaster
images
in
hutton
collection
of
casts
the
hand
i
know
in
life
has
the
fullness
of
blood
in
its
veins
and
is
elastic
with
spirit
how
different
dear
hutton
hand
was
from
its
dull
insensate
image
to
me
the
cast
lacks
the
very
form
of
the
hand
of
the
many
casts
in
hutton
collection
i
did
not
recognize
any
not
even
my
own
but
a
loving
hand
i
never
forget
i
remember
in
my
fingers
the
large
hands
of
bishop
brooks
brimful
of
tenderness
and
a
strong
man
joy
if
you
were
deaf
and
blind
and
could
have
held
jefferson
hand
you
would
have
seen
in
it
a
face
and
heard
a
kind
voice
unlike
any
other
you
have
known
mark
twain
hand
is
full
of
whimsies
and
the
drollest
humours
and
while
you
hold
it
the
drollery
changes
to
sympathy
and
championship

i
am
told
that
the
words
i
have
just
written
do
not
describe
the
hands
of
my
friends
but
merely
endow
them
with
the
kindly
human
qualities
which
i
know
they
possess
and
which
language
conveys
in
abstract
words
the
criticism
implies
that
i
am
not
giving
the
primary
truth
of
what
i
feel
but
how
otherwise
do
descriptions
in
books
i
read
written
by
men
who
can
see
render
the
visible
look
of
a
face
i
read
that
a
face
is
strong
gentle
that
it
is
full
of
patience
of
intellect
that
it
is
fine
sweet
noble
beautiful
have
i
not
the
same
right
to
use
these
words
in
describing
what
i
feel
as
you
have
in
describing
what
you
see
they
express
truly
what
i
feel
in
the
hand
i
am
seldom
conscious
of
physical
qualities
and
i
do
not
remember
whether
the
fingers
of
a
hand
are
short
or
long
or
the
skin
is
moist
or
dry
no
more
can
you
without
conscious
effort
recall
the
details
of
a
face
even
when
you
have
seen
it
many
times
if
you
do
recall
the
features
and
say
that
an
eye
is
blue
a
chin
sharp
a
nose
short
or
a
cheek
sunken
i
fancy
that
you
do
not
succeed
well
in
giving
the
impression
of
the
person
not
so
well
as
when
you
interpret
at
once
to
the
heart
the
essential
moral
qualities
of
the
face
its
humour
gravity
sadness
spirituality
if
i
should
tell
you
in
physical
terms
how
a
hand
feels
you
would
be
no
wiser
for
my
account
than
a
blind
man
to
whom
you
describe
a
face
in
detail
remember
that
when
a
blind
man
recovers
his
sight
he
does
not
recognize
the
commonest
thing
that
has
been
familiar
to
his
touch
the
dearest
face
intimate
to
his
fingers
and
it
does
not
help
him
at
all
that
things
and
people
have
been
described
to
him
again
and
again
so
you
who
are
untrained
of
touch
do
not
recognize
a
hand
by
the
grasp
and
so
too
any
description
i
might
give
would
fail
to
make
you
acquainted
with
a
friendly
hand
which
my
fingers
have
often
folded
about
and
which
my
affection
translates
to
my
memory
i
can
not
describe
hands
under
any
class
or
type
there
is
no
democracy
of
hands
some
hands
tell
me
that
they
do
everything
with
the
maximum
of
bustle
and
noise
other
hands
are
fidgety
and
unadvised
with
nervous
fussy
fingers
which
indicate
a
nature
sensitive
to
the
little
pricks
of
daily
life
sometimes
i
recognize
with
foreboding
the
kindly
but
stupid
hand
of
one
who
tells
with
many
words
news
that
is
no
news
i
have
met
a
bishop
with
a
jocose
hand
a
humourist
with
a
hand
of
leaden
gravity
a
man
of
pretentious
valour
with
a
timorous
hand
and
a
quiet
apologetic
man
with
a
fist
of
iron
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
was
taken
to
see
a
a
woman
who
was
blind
and
paralysed
i
shall
never
forget
how
she
held
out
her
small
trembling
hand
and
pressed
sympathy
into
mine
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
as
i
think
of
her
the
weariness
pain
darkness
and
sweet
patience
were
all
to
be
felt
in
her
thin
wasted
groping
loving
hand
few
people
who
do
not
know
me
will
understand
i
think
how
much
i
get
of
the
mood
of
a
friend
who
is
engaged
in
oral
conversation
with
somebody
else
my
hand
follows
his
motions
i
touch
his
hand
his
arm
his
face
i
can
tell
when
he
is
full
of
glee
over
a
good
joke
which
has
not
been
repeated
to
me
or
when
he
is
telling
a
lively
story
one
of
my
friends
is
rather
aggressive
and
his
hand
always
announces
the
coming
of
a
dispute
by
his
impatient
jerk
i
know
he
has
argument
ready
for
some
one
i
have
felt
him
start
as
a
sudden
recollection
or
a
new
idea
shot
through
his
mind
i
have
felt
grief
in
his
hand
i
have
felt
his
soul
wrap
itself
in
darkness
majestically
as
in
a
garment
another
friend
has
positive
emphatic
hands
which
show
great
pertinacity
of
opinion
she
is
the
only
person
i
know
who
emphasizes
her
spelled
words
and
accents
them
as
she
emphasizes
and
accents
her
spoken
words
when
i
read
her
lips
i
like
this
varied
emphasis
better
than
the
monotonous
pound
of
unmodulated
people
who
hammer
their
meaning
into
my
palm
some
hands
when
they
clasp
yours
beam
and
bubble
over
with
gladness
they
throb
and
expand
with
life
strangers
have
clasped
my
hand
like
that
of
a
sister
other
people
shake
hands
with
me
as
if
with
the
fear
that
i
may
do
them
mischief
such
persons
hold
out
civil
which
they
permit
you
to
touch
and
in
the
moment
of
contract
they
retreat
and
inwardly
you
hope
that
you
will
not
be
called
upon
again
to
take
that
hand
of
dormouse
valour
it
betokens
a
prudish
mind
ungracious
pride
and
not
seldom
mistrust
it
is
the
antipode
to
the
hand
of
those
who
have
large
lovable
natures
the
handshake
of
some
people
makes
you
think
of
accident
and
sudden
death
contrast
this
hand
with
the
quick
skilful
quiet
hand
of
a
nurse
whom
i
remember
with
affection
because
she
took
the
best
care
of
my
teacher
i
have
clasped
the
hands
of
some
rich
people
that
spin
not
and
toil
not
and
yet
are
not
beautiful
beneath
their
soft
smooth
roundness
what
a
chaos
of
undeveloped
character
i
am
sure
there
is
no
hand
comparable
to
the
physician
in
patient
skill
merciful
gentleness
and
splendid
certainty
no
wonder
that
ruskin
finds
in
the
sure
strokes
of
the
surgeon
the
perfection
of
control
and
delicate
precision
for
the
artist
to
emulate
if
the
physician
is
a
man
of
great
nature
there
will
be
healing
for
the
spirit
in
his
touch
this
magic
touch
of
was
in
the
hand
of
a
dear
friend
of
mine
who
was
our
doctor
in
sickness
and
health
his
happy
cordial
spirit
did
his
patients
good
whether
they
needed
medicine
or
not
as
there
are
many
beauties
of
the
face
so
the
beauties
of
the
hand
are
many
touch
has
its
ecstasies
the
hands
of
people
of
strong
individuality
and
sensitiveness
are
wonderfully
mobile
in
a
glance
of
their
they
express
many
shades
of
thought
now
and
again
i
touch
a
fine
graceful
hand
which
spells
with
the
same
beauty
and
distinction
that
you
must
see
in
the
handwriting
of
some
highly
cultivated
people
i
wish
you
could
see
how
prettily
little
children
spell
in
my
hand
they
are
wild
flowers
of
humanity
and
their
finger
motions
wild
flowers
of
speech
all
this
is
my
private
science
of
palmistry
and
when
i
tell
your
fortune
it
is
by
no
mysterious
intuition
or
gipsy
witchcraft
but
by
natural
explicable
recognition
of
the
embossed
character
in
your
hand
not
only
is
the
hand
as
easy
to
recognize
as
the
face
but
it
reveals
its
secrets
more
openly
and
unconsciously
people
control
their
countenances
but
the
hand
is
under
no
such
restraint
it
relaxes
and
becomes
listless
when
the
spirit
is
low
and
dejected
the
muscles
tighten
when
the
mind
is
excited
or
the
heart
glad
and
permanent
qualities
stand
written
on
it
all
the
time
footnote
a
the
excellent
has
put
a
query
to
my
use
of
the
word
see
if
i
had
said
visit
he
would
have
asked
no
questions
yet
what
does
visit
mean
but
see
later
i
will
try
to
defend
myself
for
using
as
much
of
the
english
language
as
i
have
succeeded
in
learning
the
hand
of
the
race
iii
the
hand
of
the
race
look
in
your
century
dictionary
or
if
you
are
blind
ask
your
teacher
to
do
it
for
you
and
learn
how
many
idioms
are
made
on
the
idea
of
hand
and
how
many
words
are
formed
from
the
latin
root
enough
words
to
name
all
the
essential
affairs
of
life
hand
with
quotations
and
compounds
occupies
columns
eight
pages
of
this
dictionary
the
hand
is
defined
as
the
organ
of
apprehension
how
perfectly
the
definition
fits
my
case
in
both
senses
of
the
word
apprehend
with
my
hand
i
seize
and
hold
all
that
i
find
in
the
three
worlds
physical
intellectual
and
spiritual
think
how
man
has
regarded
the
world
in
terms
of
the
hand
all
life
is
divided
between
what
lies
one
and
on
the
other
the
products
of
skill
are
the
conduct
of
affairs
is
history
seems
to
be
the
record
alas
for
our
chronicles
of
war
of
the
of
armies
but
the
history
of
peace
too
the
narrative
of
labour
in
the
field
the
forest
and
the
vineyard
is
written
in
the
victorious
sign
the
sign
of
the
hand
that
has
conquered
the
wilderness
the
labourer
himself
is
called
a
in
and
we
read
the
story
of
human
slavery
and
freedom
the
minor
idioms
are
myriad
but
i
will
not
recall
too
many
lest
you
cry
hands
off
i
can
not
desist
however
from
this
until
i
have
set
down
a
few
whatever
is
not
one
own
by
first
possession
is
that
is
what
i
am
told
my
knowledge
is
but
my
friends
come
to
my
defence
and
not
content
with
endowing
me
with
natural
knowledge
which
is
rightfully
mine
ascribe
to
me
a
preternatural
sixth
sense
and
credit
to
miracles
and
compensations
all
that
i
have
won
and
discovered
with
my
good
right
hand
and
with
my
left
hand
too
for
with
that
i
read
and
it
is
as
true
and
honourable
as
the
other
by
what
of
human
power
has
the
left
hand
been
neglected
when
we
arrive
at
the
acme
of
civilization
shall
we
not
all
be
ambidextrous
and
in
our
contests
against
difficulties
shall
we
not
be
doubly
triumphant
it
occurs
to
me
by
the
way
that
when
my
teacher
was
training
my
unreclaimed
spirit
her
struggle
against
the
powers
of
darkness
with
the
stout
arm
of
discipline
and
the
light
of
the
manual
alphabet
was
in
two
senses
a
conflict
no
essay
would
be
complete
without
quotations
from
shakspere
in
the
field
which
in
the
presumption
of
my
youth
i
thought
was
my
own
he
has
reaped
before
me
in
almost
every
play
there
are
passages
where
the
hand
plays
a
part
lady
macbeth
soliloquy
over
her
little
hand
from
which
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
wash
the
stain
is
the
most
pitiful
moment
in
the
tragedy
mark
antony
rewards
scarus
the
bravest
of
his
soldiers
by
asking
cleopatra
to
give
him
her
hand
commend
unto
his
lips
thy
favouring
hand
in
a
different
mood
he
is
enraged
because
thyreus
whom
he
despises
has
presumed
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
queen
my
playfellow
the
kingly
seal
of
high
hearts
when
cleopatra
is
threatened
with
the
humiliation
of
gracing
cæsar
triumph
she
snatches
a
dagger
exclaiming
i
will
trust
my
resolution
and
my
good
hands
with
the
same
swift
instinct
cassius
trusts
to
his

says
the

replies
the
broken
old
king
it
smells
of
mortality
how
charged
is
this
single
touch
with
sad
meaning
how
it
opens
our
eyes
to
the
fearful
purging
lear
has
undergone
to
learn
that
royalty
is
no
defence
against
ingratitude
and
cruelty
gloster
exclamation
about
his
son
did
i
but
live
to
see
thee
in
my
touch
i
say
i
had
eyes
again
is
as
true
to
a
pulse
within
me
as
the
grief
he
feels
the
ghost
in
hamlet
recites
the
wrongs
from
which
springs
the
tragedy
thus
was
i
sleeping
by
a
brother
hand
at
once
of
life
of
crown
of
queen
dispatch
how
that
passage
in
othello
stops
your
breath
that
passage
full
of
bitter
double
intention
in
which
othello
suspicion
tips
with
evil
what
he
says
about
desdemona
hand
and
she
in
innocence
answers
only
the
innocent
meaning
of
his
words
for
was
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
not
all
shakspere
great
passages
about
the
hand
are
tragic
remember
the
light
play
of
words
in
romeo
and
juliet
where
the
dialogue
flying
nimbly
back
and
forth
weaves
a
pretty
sonnet
about
the
hand
and
who
knows
the
hand
if
not
the
lover
the
touch
of
the
hand
is
in
every
chapter
of
the
bible
why
you
could
almost
rewrite
exodus
as
the
story
of
the
hand
everything
is
done
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
of
moses
the
oppression
of
the
hebrews
is
translated
thus
the
hand
of
pharaoh
was
heavy
upon
the
hebrews
their
departure
out
of
the
land
is
told
in
these
vivid
words
the
lord
brought
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
with
a
strong
hand
and
a
arm
at
the
stretching
out
of
the
hand
of
moses
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
part
and
stand
all
on
a
heap
when
the
lord
lifts
his
hand
in
anger
thousands
perish
in
the
wilderness
every
act
every
decree
in
the
history
of
israel
as
indeed
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
is
sanctioned
by
the
hand
is
it
not
used
in
the
great
moments
of
swearing
blessing
cursing
smiting
agreeing
marrying
building
destroying
its
sacredness
is
in
the
law
that
no
sacrifice
is
valid
unless
the
sacrificer
lay
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
the
victim
the
congregation
lay
their
hands
on
the
heads
of
those
who
are
sentenced
to
death
how
terrible
the
dumb
condemnation
of
their
hands
must
be
to
the
condemned
when
moses
builds
the
altar
on
mount
sinai
he
is
commanded
to
use
no
tool
but
rear
it
with
his
own
hands
earth
sea
sky
man
and
all
lower
animals
are
holy
unto
the
lord
because
he
has
formed
them
with
his
hand
when
the
psalmist
considers
the
heavens
and
the
earth
he
exclaims
what
is
man
o
lord
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
for
thou
hast
made
him
to
have
dominion
over
the
works
of
thy
hands
the
supplicating
gesture
of
the
hand
always
accompanies
the
spoken
prayer
and
with
clean
hands
goes
the
pure
heart
christ
comforted
and
blessed
and
healed
and
wrought
many
miracles
with
his
hands
he
touched
the
eyes
of
the
blind
and
they
were
opened
when
jairus
sought
him
overwhelmed
with
grief
jesus
went
and
laid
his
hands
on
the
ruler
daughter
and
she
awoke
from
the
sleep
of
death
to
her
father
love
you
also
remember
how
he
healed
the
crooked
woman
he
said
to
her
woman
thou
art
loosed
from
thine
infirmity
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
and
immediately
she
was
made
straight
and
she
glorified
god
look
where
we
will
we
find
the
hand
in
time
and
history
working
building
inventing
bringing
civilization
out
of
barbarism
the
hand
symbolizes
power
and
the
excellence
of
work
the
mechanic
hand
that
minister
of
elemental
forces
the
hand
that
hews
saws
cuts
builds
is
useful
in
the
world
equally
with
the
delicate
hand
that
paints
a
wild
flower
or
moulds
a
grecian
urn
or
the
hand
of
a
statesman
that
writes
a
law
the
eye
can
not
say
to
the
hand
i
have
no
need
of
thee
blessed
be
the
hand
thrice
blessed
be
the
hands
that
work
the
power
of
touch
iv
the
power
of
touch
some
months
ago
in
a
newspaper
which
announced
the
publication
of
the
matilda
ziegler
magazine
for
the
blind
appeared
the
following
paragraph
many
poems
and
stories
must
be
omitted
because
they
deal
with
sight
allusion
to
moonbeams
rainbows
starlight
clouds
and
beautiful
scenery
may
not
be
printed
because
they
serve
to
emphasize
the
blind
man
sense
of
his
affliction
that
is
to
say
i
may
not
talk
about
beautiful
mansions
and
gardens
because
i
am
poor
i
may
not
read
about
paris
and
the
west
indies
because
i
can
not
visit
them
in
their
territorial
reality
i
may
not
dream
of
heaven
because
it
is
possible
that
i
may
never
go
there
yet
a
venturesome
spirit
impels
me
to
use
words
of
sight
and
sound
whose
meaning
i
can
guess
only
from
analogy
and
fancy
this
hazardous
game
is
half
the
delight
the
frolic
of
daily
life
i
glow
as
i
read
of
splendours
which
the
eye
alone
can
survey
allusions
to
moonbeams
and
clouds
do
not
emphasize
the
sense
of
my
affliction
they
carry
my
soul
beyond
affliction
narrow
actuality
critics
delight
to
tell
us
what
we
can
not
do
they
assume
that
blindness
and
deafness
sever
us
completely
from
the
things
which
the
seeing
and
the
hearing
enjoy
and
hence
they
assert
we
have
no
moral
right
to
talk
about
beauty
the
skies
mountains
the
song
of
birds
and
colours
they
declare
that
the
very
sensations
we
have
from
the
sense
of
touch
are
vicarious
as
though
our
friends
felt
the
sun
for
us
they
deny
what
they
have
not
seen
and
i
have
felt
some
brave
doubters
have
gone
so
far
even
as
to
deny
my
existence
in
order
therefore
that
i
may
know
that
i
exist
i
resort
to
descartes
method
i
think
therefore
i
am
thus
i
am
metaphysically
established
and
i
throw
upon
the
doubters
the
burden
of
proving
my
when
we
consider
how
little
has
been
found
out
about
the
mind
is
it
not
amazing
that
any
one
should
presume
to
define
what
one
can
know
or
can
not
know
i
admit
that
there
are
innumerable
marvels
in
the
visible
universe
unguessed
by
me
likewise
o
confident
critic
there
are
a
myriad
sensations
perceived
by
me
of
which
you
do
not
dream
necessity
gives
to
the
eye
a
precious
power
of
seeing
and
in
the
same
way
it
gives
a
precious
power
of
feeling
to
the
whole
body
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
the
very
substance
of
my
flesh
were
so
many
eyes
looking
out
at
will
upon
a
world
new
created
every
day
the
silence
and
darkness
which
are
said
to
shut
me
in
open
my
door
most
hospitably
to
countless
sensations
that
distract
inform
admonish
and
amuse
with
my
three
trusty
guides
touch
smell
and
taste
i
make
many
excursions
into
the
borderland
of
experience
which
is
in
sight
of
the
city
of
light
nature
accommodates
itself
to
every
man
necessity
if
the
eye
is
maimed
so
that
it
does
not
see
the
beauteous
face
of
day
the
touch
becomes
more
poignant
and
discriminating
nature
proceeds
through
practice
to
strengthen
and
augment
the
remaining
senses
for
this
reason
the
blind
often
hear
with
greater
ease
and
distinctness
than
other
people
the
sense
of
smell
becomes
almost
a
new
faculty
to
penetrate
the
tangle
and
vagueness
of
things
thus
according
to
an
immutable
law
the
senses
assist
and
reinforce
one
another
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
we
see
best
with
the
hand
or
the
eye
i
only
know
that
the
world
i
see
with
my
fingers
is
alive
ruddy
and
satisfying
touch
brings
the
blind
many
sweet
certainties
which
our
more
fortunate
fellows
miss
because
their
sense
of
touch
is
uncultivated
when
they
look
at
things
they
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
no
doubt
that
is
one
reason
why
their
knowledge
is
often
so
vague
inaccurate
and
useless
it
is
probable
too
that
our
knowledge
of
phenomena
beyond
the
reach
of
the
hand
is
equally
imperfect
but
at
all
events
we
behold
them
through
a
golden
mist
of
fantasy
there
is
nothing
however
misty
or
uncertain
about
what
we
can
touch
through
the
sense
of
touch
i
know
the
faces
of
friends
the
illimitable
variety
of
straight
and
curved
lines
all
surfaces
the
exuberance
of
the
soil
the
delicate
shapes
of
flowers
the
noble
forms
of
trees
and
the
range
of
mighty
winds
besides
objects
surfaces
and
atmospherical
changes
i
perceive
countless
vibrations
i
derive
much
knowledge
of
everyday
matter
from
the
jars
and
jolts
which
are
to
be
felt
everywhere
in
the
house
footsteps
i
discover
vary
tactually
according
to
the
age
the
sex
and
the
manners
of
the
walker
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
a
child
patter
for
the
tread
of
a
grown
person
the
step
of
the
young
man
strong
and
free
differs
from
the
heavy
sedate
tread
of
the
and
from
the
step
of
the
old
man
whose
feet
drag
along
the
floor
or
beat
it
with
slow
faltering
accents
on
a
bare
floor
a
girl
walks
with
a
rapid
elastic
rhythm
which
is
quite
distinct
from
the
graver
step
of
the
elderly
woman
i
have
laughed
over
the
creak
of
new
shoes
and
the
clatter
of
a
stout
maid
performing
a
jig
in
the
kitchen
one
day
in
the
of
an
hotel
a
tactual
dissonance
arrested
my
attention
i
sat
still
and
listened
with
my
feet
i
found
that
two
waiters
were
walking
back
and
forth
but
not
with
the
same
gait
a
band
was
playing
and
i
could
feel
the
along
the
floor
one
of
the
waiters
walked
in
time
to
the
band
graceful
and
light
while
the
other
disregarded
the
music
and
rushed
from
table
to
table
to
the
beat
of
some
discord
in
his
own
mind
their
steps
reminded
me
of
a
spirited
harnessed
with
a
often
footsteps
reveal
in
some
measure
the
character
and
the
mood
of
the
walker
i
feel
in
them
firmness
and
indecision
hurry
and
deliberation
activity
and
laziness
fatigue
carelessness
timidity
anger
and
sorrow
i
am
most
conscious
of
these
moods
and
traits
in
persons
with
whom
i
am
familiar
footsteps
are
frequently
interrupted
by
certain
jars
and
jerks
so
that
i
know
when
one
kneels
kicks
shakes
something
sits
down
or
gets
up
thus
i
follow
to
some
extent
the
actions
of
people
about
me
and
the
changes
of
their
postures
just
now
a
thick
soft
patter
of
bare
padded
feet
and
a
slight
jolt
told
me
that
my
dog
had
jumped
on
the
chair
to
look
out
of
the
window
i
do
not
however
allow
him
to
go
uninvestigated
for
occasionally
i
feel
the
same
motion
and
find
him
not
on
the
chair
but
trespassing
on
the
sofa
when
a
carpenter
works
in
the
house
or
in
the
barn
near
by
i
know
by
the
slanting
toothed
vibration
and
the
ringing
concussion
of
blow
upon
blow
that
he
is
sawing
or
hammering
if
i
am
near
enough
a
certain
vibration
travelling
back
and
forth
along
a
wooden
surface
brings
me
the
information
that
he
is
using
a
plane
a
slight
flutter
on
the
rug
tells
me
that
a
breeze
has
blown
my
papers
off
the
table
a
round
thump
is
a
signal
that
a
pencil
has
rolled
on
the
floor
if
a
book
falls
it
gives
a
flat
thud
a
wooden
rap
on
the
balustrade
announces
that
dinner
is
ready
many
of
these
vibrations
are
obliterated
out
of
doors
on
a
lawn
or
the
road
i
can
feel
only
running
stamping
and
the
rumble
of
wheels
by
placing
my
hand
on
a
person
lips
and
throat
i
gain
an
idea
of
many
specific
vibrations
and
interpret
them
a
boy
chuckle
a
whew
of
surprise
the
hem
of
annoyance
or
perplexity
the
moan
of
pain
a
scream
a
whisper
a
rasp
a
sob
a
choke
and
a
gasp
the
utterances
of
animals
though
wordless
are
eloquent
to
me
the
purr
its
mew
its
angry
jerky
scolding
spit
the
dog
of
warning
or
of
joyous
welcome
its
yelp
of
despair
and
its
contented
snore
the
cow
moo
a
monkey
chatter
the
snort
of
a
horse
the
lion
roar
and
the
terrible
snarl
of
the
tiger
perhaps
i
ought
to
add
for
the
benefit
of
the
critics
and
doubters
who
may
peruse
this
essay
that
with
my
own
hands
i
have
felt
all
these
sounds
from
my
childhood
to
the
present
day
i
have
availed
myself
of
every
opportunity
to
visit
zoological
gardens
menageries
and
the
circus
and
all
the
animals
except
the
tiger
have
talked
into
my
hand
i
have
touched
the
tiger
only
in
a
museum
where
he
is
as
harmless
as
a
lamb
i
have
however
heard
him
talk
by
putting
my
hand
on
the
bars
of
his
cage
i
have
touched
several
lions
in
the
flesh
and
felt
them
roar
royally
like
a
cataract
over
rocks
to
continue
i
know
the
of
liquid
in
a
pitcher
so
if
i
spill
my
milk
i
have
not
the
excuse
of
ignorance
i
am
also
familiar
with
the
pop
of
a
cork
the
sputter
of
a
flame
the
of
the
clock
the
metallic
swing
of
the
windmill
the
laboured
rise
and
fall
of
the
pump
the
voluminous
spurt
of
the
hose
the
deceptive
tap
of
the
breeze
at
door
and
window
and
many
other
vibrations
past
computing
there
are
tactual
vibrations
which
do
not
belong
to
they
penetrate
the
skin
the
nerves
the
bones
like
pain
heat
and
cold
the
beat
of
a
drum
smites
me
through
from
the
chest
to
the
the
din
of
the
train
the
bridge
and
grinding
machinery
retains
its
grip
upon
me
long
after
its
cause
has
been
left
behind
if
vibration
and
motion
combine
in
my
touch
for
any
length
of
time
the
earth
seems
to
run
away
while
i
stand
still
when
i
step
off
the
train
the
platform
whirls
round
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
walk
steadily
every
atom
of
my
body
is
a
vibroscope
but
my
sensations
are
not
infallible
i
reach
out
and
my
fingers
meet
something
furry
which
jumps
about
gathers
itself
together
as
if
to
spring
and
acts
like
an
animal
i
pause
a
moment
for
caution
i
touch
it
again
more
firmly
and
find
it
is
a
fur
coat
fluttering
and
flapping
in
the
wind
to
me
as
to
you
the
earth
seems
motionless
and
the
sun
appears
to
move
for
the
rays
of
the
afternoon
withdraw
more
and
more
as
they
touch
my
face
until
the
air
becomes
cool
from
this
i
understand
how
it
is
that
the
shore
seems
to
recede
as
you
sail
away
from
it
hence
i
feel
no
incredulity
when
you
say
that
parallel
lines
appear
to
converge
and
the
earth
and
sky
to
meet
my
few
senses
long
ago
revealed
to
me
their
imperfections
and
deceptivity
not
only
are
the
senses
deceptive
but
numerous
usages
in
our
language
indicate
that
people
who
have
five
senses
find
it
difficult
to
keep
their
functions
distinct
i
understand
that
we
hear
views
see
tones
taste
music
i
am
told
that
voices
have
colour
tact
which
i
have
supposed
to
be
a
matter
of
nice
perception
turns
out
to
be
a
matter
of
taste
judging
from
the
large
use
of
the
word
taste
appears
to
be
the
most
important
of
all
the
senses
taste
governs
the
great
and
small
conventions
of
life
certainly
the
language
of
the
senses
is
full
of
contradictions
and
my
fellows
who
have
five
doors
to
their
house
are
not
more
surely
at
home
in
themselves
than
i
may
i
not
then
be
excused
if
this
account
of
my
sensations
lacks
precision
the
finer
vibrations
v
the
finer
vibrations
i
have
spoken
of
the
numerous
jars
and
jolts
which
daily
minister
to
my
faculties
the
loftier
and
grander
vibrations
which
appeal
to
my
emotions
are
varied
and
abundant
i
listen
with
awe
to
the
roll
of
the
thunder
and
the
muffled
avalanche
of
sound
when
the
sea
flings
itself
upon
the
shore
and
i
love
the
instrument
by
which
all
the
diapasons
of
the
ocean
are
caught
and
released
in
surging
floods
the
organ
if
music
could
be
seen
i
could
point
where
the
go
as
they
rise
and
fall
climb
up
and
up
rock
and
sway
now
loud
and
deep
now
high
and
stormy
anon
soft
and
solemn
with
lighter
vibrations
interspersed
between
and
running
across
them
i
should
say
that
fills
to
an
ecstasy
the
act
of
feeling
there
is
tangible
delight
in
other
instruments
too
the
violin
seems
beautifully
alive
as
it
responds
to
the
lightest
wish
of
the
master
the
distinction
between
its
notes
is
more
delicate
than
between
the
notes
of
the
piano
i
enjoy
the
music
of
the
piano
most
when
i
touch
the
instrument
if
i
keep
my
hand
on
the
i
detect
tiny
quavers
returns
of
melody
and
the
hush
that
follows
this
explains
to
me
how
sound
can
die
away
to
the
listening
ear
how
thin
and
clear
and
thinner
clearer
farther
going
o
sweet
and
far
from
cliff
and
scar
the
horns
of
elfland
faintly
blowing
i
am
able
to
follow
the
dominant
spirit
and
mood
of
the
music
i
catch
the
joyous
dance
as
it
bounds
over
the
keys
the
slow
dirge
the
reverie
i
thrill
to
the
fiery
sweep
of
notes
crossed
by
thunderous
tones
in
the
walküre
where
kindles
the
dread
flames
that
guard
the
sleeping
how
wonderful
is
the
instrument
on
which
a
great
musician
sings
with
his
hands
i
have
never
succeeded
in
distinguishing
one
composition
from
another
i
think
this
is
impossible
but
the
concentration
and
strain
upon
my
attention
would
be
so
great
that
i
doubt
if
the
pleasure
derived
would
be
commensurate
to
the
effort
nor
can
i
distinguish
easily
a
tune
that
is
sung
but
by
placing
my
hand
on
another
throat
and
cheek
i
enjoy
the
changes
of
the
voice
i
know
when
it
is
low
or
high
clear
or
muffled
sad
or
cheery
the
thin
quavering
sensation
of
an
old
voice
differs
in
my
touch
from
the
sensation
of
a
young
voice
a
southerner
drawl
is
quite
unlike
the
yankee
twang
sometimes
the
flow
and
ebb
of
a
voice
is
so
enchanting
that
my
fingers
quiver
with
exquisite
pleasure
even
if
i
do
not
understand
a
word
that
is
spoken
on
the
other
hand
i
am
exceedingly
sensitive
to
the
harshness
of
noises
like
grinding
scraping
and
the
hoarse
creak
of
rusty
locks
are
my
vibratory
nightmares
i
have
stood
near
a
bridge
in
process
of
construction
and
felt
the
tactual
din
the
rattle
of
heavy
masses
of
stone
the
roll
of
loosened
earth
the
rumble
of
engines
the
dumping
of
the
triple
blows
of
vulcan
hammers
i
can
also
smell
the
the
tar
and
cement
so
i
have
a
vivid
idea
of
mighty
labours
in
steel
and
stone
and
i
believe
that
i
am
acquainted
with
all
the
fiendish
noises
which
can
be
made
by
man
or
machinery
the
whack
of
heavy
falling
bodies
the
sudden
shivering
splinter
of
chopped
logs
the
crystal
shatter
of
pounded
ice
the
crash
of
a
tree
hurled
to
the
earth
by
a
hurricane
the
irrational
persistent
chaos
of
noise
made
by
switching
the
explosion
of
gas
the
blasting
of
stone
and
the
terrific
grinding
of
rock
upon
rock
which
precedes
the
collapse
all
these
have
been
in
my
and
contribute
to
my
idea
of
bedlam
of
a
battle
a
waterspout
an
earthquake
and
other
enormous
accumulations
of
sound
touch
brings
me
into
contact
with
the
traffic
and
manifold
activity
of
the
city
besides
the
bustle
and
crowding
of
people
and
the
nondescript
grating
and
electric
howling
of
i
am
conscious
of
exhalations
from
many
different
kinds
of
shops
from
automobiles
drays
horses
fruit
stands
and
many
varieties
of
smoke
odours
strange
and
musty
the
air
sharp
and

the
city
is
interesting
but
the
tactual
silence
of
the
country
is
always
most
welcome
after
the
din
of
town
and
the
irritating
concussions
of
the
train
how
noiseless
and
undisturbing
are
the
demolition
the
repairs
and
the
alterations
of
nature
with
no
sound
of
hammer
or
saw
or
stone
severed
from
stone
but
a
music
of
rustles
and
ripe
thumps
on
the
grass
come
the
fluttering
leaves
and
mellow
fruits
which
the
wind
tumbles
all
day
from
the
branches
silently
all
droops
all
withers
all
is
poured
back
into
the
earth
that
it
may
recreate
all
sleeps
while
the
busy
architects
of
day
and
night
ply
their
silent
work
elsewhere
the
same
serenity
reigns
when
all
at
once
the
soil
yields
up
a
newly
wrought
creation
softly
the
ocean
of
grass
moss
and
flowers
rolls
surge
upon
surge
across
the
earth
curtains
of
foliage
drape
the
bare
branches
great
trees
make
ready
in
their
sturdy
hearts
to
receive
again
birds
which
occupy
their
spacious
chambers
to
the
south
and
west
nay
there
is
no
place
so
lowly
that
it
may
not
lodge
some
happy
creature
the
meadow
brook
undoes
its
icy
fetters
with
rippling
notes
gurgles
and
runs
free
and
all
this
is
wrought
in
less
than
two
months
to
the
music
of
nature
orchestra
in
the
midst
of
balmy
incense
the
thousand
soft
voices
of
the
earth
have
truly
found
their
way
to
me
the
small
rustle
in
tufts
of
grass
the
silky
swish
of
leaves
the
buzz
of
insects
the
hum
of
bees
in
blossoms
i
have
plucked
the
flutter
of
a
bird
wings
after
his
bath
and
the
slender
rippling
vibration
of
water
running
over
pebbles
once
having
been
felt
these
loved
voices
rustle
buzz
hum
flutter
and
ripple
in
my
thought
forever
an
undying
part
of
happy
memories
between
my
experiences
and
the
experiences
of
others
there
is
no
gulf
of
mute
space
which
i
may
not
bridge
for
i
have
endlessly
varied
instructive
contacts
with
all
the
world
with
life
with
the
atmosphere
whose
radiant
activity
enfolds
us
all
the
thrilling
energy
of
the
air
is
warm
and
rapturous
and
play
upon
my
face
in
infinite
variety
and
combination
until
i
am
able
to
surmise
what
must
be
the
myriad
sounds
that
my
senseless
ears
have
not
heard
the
air
varies
in
different
regions
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
and
even
different
hours
of
the
day
the
odorous
fresh
are
distinct
from
the
fitful
breezes
along
river
banks
which
are
humid
and
freighted
with
inland
smells
the
bracing
light
dry
air
of
the
mountains
can
never
be
mistaken
for
the
pungent
salt
air
of
the
ocean
the
air
of
winter
is
dense
hard
compressed
in
the
spring
it
has
new
vitality
it
is
light
mobile
and
laden
with
a
thousand
palpitating
odours
from
earth
grass
and
sprouting
leaves
the
air
of
midsummer
is
dense
saturated
or
dry
and
burning
as
if
it
came
from
a
furnace
when
a
cool
breeze
brushes
the
sultry
stillness
it
brings
fewer
odours
than
in
may
and
frequently
the
odour
of
a
coming
tempest
the
avalanche
of
coolness
which
sweeps
through
the
air
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
stinging
coolness
of
winter
the
rain
of
winter
is
raw
without
odour
and
dismal
the
rain
of
spring
is
brisk
fragrant
charged
with
warmth
i
welcome
it
delightedly
as
it
visits
the
earth
enriches
the
streams
waters
the
hills
abundantly
makes
the
furrows
soft
with
showers
for
the
seed
elicits
a
perfume
which
i
can
not
breathe
deep
enough
spring
rain
is
beautiful
impartial
lovable
with
pearly
drops
it
washes
every
leaf
on

and

ministers
equally
to
salutary
herbs
and
noxious

searches
out
every
living
thing
that
needs
its
beneficence
the
senses
assist
and
reinforce
each
other
to
such
an
extent
that
i
am
not
sure
whether
touch
or
smell
tells
me
the
most
about
the
world
everywhere
the
river
of
touch
is
joined
by
the
brooks
of
each
season
has
its
distinctive
odours
the
spring
is
earthy
and
full
of
sap
july
is
rich
with
the
odour
of
ripening
grain
and
hay
as
the
season
advances
a
crisp
dry
mature
odour
predominates
and
tansy
and
everlastings
mark
the
onward
march
of
the
year
in
autumn
soft
alluring
scents
fill
the
air
floating
from
thicket
grass
flower
and

and
they
tell
me
of
time
and
change
of
death
and
life
renewal
desire
and
its
fulfilment

vi
smell
the
fallen
angel
for
some
inexplicable
reason
the
sense
of
smell
does
not
hold
the
high
position
it
deserves
among
its
sisters
there
is
something
of
the
fallen
angel
about
it
when
it
woos
us
with
woodland
scents
and
beguiles
us
with
the
fragrance
of
lovely
gardens
it
is
admitted
frankly
to
our
discourse
but
when
it
gives
us
warning
of
something
noxious
in
our
vicinity
it
is
treated
as
if
the
demon
had
got
the
upper
hand
of
the
angel
and
is
relegated
to
outer
darkness
punished
for
its
faithful
service
it
is
most
difficult
to
keep
the
true
significance
of
words
when
one
discusses
the
prejudices
of
mankind
and
i
find
it
hard
to
give
an
account
of
which
shall
be
at
once
dignified
and
truthful
in
my
experience
smell
is
most
important
and
i
find
that
there
is
high
authority
for
the
nobility
of
the
sense
which
we
have
neglected
and
disparaged
it
is
recorded
that
the
lord
commanded
that
incense
be
burnt
before
him
continually
with
a
sweet
savour
i
doubt
if
there
is
any
sensation
arising
from
sight
more
delightful
than
the
odours
which
filter
through
branches
or
the
tide
of
scents
which
swells
subsides
rises
again
wave
on
wave
filling
the
wide
world
with
invisible
sweetness
a
whiff
of
the
universe
makes
us
dream
of
worlds
we
have
never
seen
recalls
in
a
flash
entire
epochs
of
our
dearest
experience
i
never
smell
daisies
without
living
over
again
the
ecstatic
mornings
that
my
teacher
and
i
spent
wandering
in
the
fields
while
i
learned
new
words
and
the
names
of
things
smell
is
a
potent
wizard
that
transports
us
across
a
thousand
miles
and
all
the
years
we
have
lived
the
odour
of
fruits
wafts
me
to
my
southern
home
to
my
childish
frolics
in
the
peach
orchard
other
odours
instantaneous
and
fleeting
cause
my
heart
to
dilate
joyously
or
contract
with
remembered
grief
even
as
i
think
of
smells
my
nose
is
full
of
scents
that
start
awake
sweet
memories
of
summers
gone
and
ripening
grain
fields
far
away
the
faintest
whiff
from
a
meadow
where
the
hay
lies
in
the
hot
sun
displaces
the
here
and
the
now
i
am
back
again
in
the
old
red
barn
my
little
friends
and
i
are
playing
in
the
haymow
a
huge
mow
it
is
packed
with
crisp
sweet
hay
from
the
top
of
which
the
smallest
child
can
reach
the
straining
rafters
in
their

beneath

with
sweet
moist
mouth
lazily
extracting
the
cordial
from
timothy
and
clover
and
dreaming
of
deep
june
pastures
and
murmurous
streams
the
sense
of
smell
has
told
me
of
a
coming
storm
hours
before
there
was
any
sign
of
it
visible
i
notice
first
a
throb
of
expectancy
a
slight
quiver
a
concentration
in
my
nostrils
as
the
storm
draws
nearer
my
nostrils
dilate
the
better
to
receive
the
flood
of
which
seem
to
multiply
and
extend
until
i
feel
the
splash
of
rain
against
my
cheek
as
the
tempest
departs
receding
farther
and
farther
the
odours
fade
become
fainter
and
fainter
and
die
away
beyond
the
bar
of
space
i
know
by
smell
the
kind
of
house
we
enter
i
have
recognized
an
country
house
because
it
has
several
layers
of
odours
left
by
a
succession
of
families
of
plants
perfumes
and
draperies
in
the
evening
quiet
there
are
fewer
vibrations
than
in
the
daytime
and
then
i
rely
more
largely
upon
smell
the
sulphuric
scent
of
a
match
tells
me
that
the
lamps
are
being
lighted
later
i
note
the
wavering
trail
of
odour
that
flits
about
and
disappears
it
is
the
curfew
signal
the
lights
are
out
for
the
night
out
of
doors
i
am
aware
by
smell
and
touch
of
the
ground
we
tread
and
the
places
we
pass
sometimes
when
there
is
no
wind
the
odours
are
so
grouped
that
i
know
the
character
of
the
country
and
can
place
a
hayfield
a
country
store
a
garden
a
barn
a
grove
of
pines
a
farmhouse
with
the
windows
open
the
other
day
i
went
to
walk
toward
a
familiar
wood
suddenly
a
disturbing
odour
made
me
pause
in
dismay
then
followed
a
peculiar
measured
jar
followed
by
dull
heavy
thunder
i
understood
the
odour
and
the
jar
only
too
well
the
trees
were
being
cut
down
we
climbed
the
stone
wall
to
the
left
it
borders
the
wood
which
i
have
loved
so
long
that
it
seems
to
be
my
peculiar
possession
but
an
unfamiliar
rush
of
air
and
an
unwonted
outburst
of
sun
told
me
that
my
tree
friends
were
gone
the
place
was
empty
like
a
deserted
dwelling
i
stretched
out
my
hand
where
once
stood
the
steadfast
pines
great
beautiful
sweet
my
hand
touched
raw
moist
stumps
all
about
lay
broken
branches
like
the
antlers
of
stricken
deer
the
fragrant
sawdust
swirled
and
tumbled
about
me
an
unreasoning
resentment
flashed
through
me
at
this
ruthless
destruction
of
the
beauty
that
i
love
but
there
is
no
anger
no
resentment
in
nature
the
air
is
equally
charged
with
the
odours
of
life
and
of
destruction
for
death
equally
with
growth
forever
ministers
to
life
the
sun
shines
as
ever
and
the
winds
riot
through
the
newly
opened
spaces
i
know
that
a
new
forest
will
spring
where
the
old
one
stood
as
beautiful
as
beneficent
touch
sensations
are
permanent
and
definite
odours
deviate
and
are
fugitive
changing
in
their
shades
degrees
and
location
there
is
something
else
in
odour
which
gives
me
a
sense
of
distance
i
should
call
it
horizon
the
line
where
odour
and
fancy
meet
at
the
farthest
limit
of
scent
smell
gives
me
more
idea
than
touch
or
taste
of
the
manner
in
which
sight
and
hearing
probably
discharge
their
functions
touch
seems
to
reside
in
the
object
touched
because
there
is
a
contact
of
surfaces
in
smell
there
is
no
notion
of
relievo
and
odour
seems
to
reside
not
in
the
object
smelt
but
in
the
organ
since
i
smell
a
tree
at
a
distance
it
is
comprehensible
to
me
that
a
person
sees
it
without
touching
it
i
am
not
puzzled
over
the
fact
that
he
receives
it
as
an
image
on
his
retina
without
relievo
since
my
smell
perceives
the
tree
as
a
thin
sphere
with
no
fullness
or
content
by
themselves
odours
suggest
nothing
i
must
learn
by
association
to
judge
from
them
of
distance
of
place
and
of
the
actions
or
the
surroundings
which
are
the
usual
occasions
for
them
just
as
i
am
told
people
judge
from
colour
light
and
sound
from
exhalations
i
learn
much
about
people
i
often
know
the
work
they
are
engaged
in
the
odours
of
wood
iron
paint
and
drugs
cling
to
the
garments
of
those
that
work
in
them
thus
i
can
distinguish
the
carpenter
from
the
ironworker
the
artist
from
the
mason
or
the
chemist
when
a
person
passes
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
i
get
a
scent
impression
of
where
he
has
been
the
kitchen
the
garden
or
the
i
gain
pleasurable
ideas
of
freshness
and
good
taste
from
the
odours
of
soap
toilet
water
clean
garments
woollen
and
silk
stuffs
and
gloves
i
have
not
indeed
the
scent
of
the
hound
or
the
wild
animal
none
but
the
halt
and
the
blind
need
fear
my
skill
in
pursuit
for
there
are
other
things
besides
water
stale
trails
confusing
cross
tracks
to
put
me
at
fault
nevertheless
human
odours
are
as
varied
and
capable
of
recognition
as
hands
and
faces
the
dear
odours
of
those
i
love
are
so
definite
so
unmistakable
that
nothing
can
quite
obliterate
them
if
many
years
should
elapse
before
i
saw
an
intimate
friend
again
i
think
i
should
recognize
his
odour
instantly
in
the
heart
of
africa
as
promptly
as
would
my
brother
that
barks
once
long
ago
in
a
crowded
railway
station
a
lady
kissed
me
as
she
hurried
by
i
had
not
touched
even
her
dress
but
she
left
a
scent
with
her
kiss
which
gave
me
a
glimpse
of
her
the
years
are
many
since
she
kissed
me
yet
her
odour
is
fresh
in
my
memory
it
is
difficult
to
put
into
words
the
thing
itself
the
elusive
there
seems
to
be
no
adequate
vocabulary
of
smells
and
i
must
fall
back
on
approximate
phrase
and
metaphor
some
people
have
a
vague
unsubstantial
odour
that
floats
about
mocking
every
effort
to
identify
it
it
is
the
of
my
olfactive
experience
sometimes
i
meet
one
who
lacks
a
distinctive
and
i
seldom
find
such
a
one
lively
or
entertaining
on
the
other
hand
one
who
has
a
pungent
odour
often
possesses
great
vitality
energy
and
vigour
of
mind
masculine
exhalations
are
as
a
rule
stronger
more
vivid
more
widely
differentiated
than
those
of
women
in
the
odour
of
young
men
there
is
something
elemental
as
of
fire
storm
and
salt
sea
it
pulsates
with
buoyancy
and
desire
it
suggests
all
things
strong
and
beautiful
and
joyous
and
gives
me
a
sense
of
physical
happiness
i
wonder
if
others
observe
that
all
infants
have
the
same
scent
pure
simple
undecipherable
as
their
dormant
personality
it
is
not
until
the
age
of
six
or
seven
that
they
begin
to
have
perceptible
individual
odours
these
develop
and
mature
along
with
their
mental
and
bodily
powers
what
i
have
written
about
smell
especially
will
perhaps
be
regarded
as
the
abnormal
sentiment
of
one
who
can
have
no
idea
of
the
world
of
reality
and
beauty
which
the
eye
perceives
there
are
people
who
are
people
who
are
most
people
are
we
should
not
condemn
a
musical
composition
on
the
testimony
of
an
ear
which
can
not
distinguish
one
chord
from
another
or
judge
a
picture
by
the
verdict
of
a
critic
the
sensations
of
smell
which
cheer
inform
and
broaden
my
life
are
not
less
pleasant
merely
because
some
critic
who
treads
the
wide
bright
pathway
of
the
eye
has
not
cultivated
his
olfactive
sense
without
the
shy
fugitive
often
unobserved
sensations
and
the
certainties
which
taste
smell
and
touch
give
me
i
should
be
obliged
to
take
my
conception
of
the
universe
wholly
from
others
i
should
lack
the
alchemy
by
which
i
now
infuse
into
my
world
light
colour
and
the
protean
spark
the
sensuous
reality
which
interthreads
and
supports
all
the
gropings
of
my
imagination
would
be
shattered
the
solid
earth
would
melt
from
under
my
feet
and
disperse
itself
in
space
the
objects
dear
to
my
hands
would
become
formless
dead
things
and
i
should
walk
among
them
as
among
invisible
ghosts
relative
values
of
the
senses
vii
relative
values
of
the
senses
i
was
once
without
the
sense
of
smell
and
taste
for
several
days
it
seemed
incredible
this
utter
detachment
from
odours
to
breathe
the
air
in
and
observe
never
a
single
scent
the
feeling
was
probably
similar
though
less
in
degree
to
that
of
one
who
first
loses
sight
and
can
not
but
expect
to
see
the
light
again
any
day
any
minute
i
knew
i
should
smell
again
some
time
still
after
the
wonder
had
passed
off
a
loneliness
crept
over
me
as
vast
as
the
air
whose
myriad
odours
i
missed
the
multitudinous
subtle
delights
that
smell
makes
mine
became
for
a
time
wistful
memories
when
i
recovered
the
lost
sense
my
heart
bounded
with
gladness
it
is
a
fine
dramatic
touch
that
hans
andersen
gives
to
the
story
of
kay
and
gerda
in
the
passage
about
flowers
kay
whom
the
wicked
magician
glass
has
blinded
to
human
love
rushes
away
fiercely
from
home
when
he
discovers
that
the
roses
have
lost
their
sweetness
the
loss
of
smell
for
a
few
days
gave
me
a
clearer
idea
than
i
had
ever
had
what
it
is
to
be
blinded
suddenly
helplessly
with
a
little
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
knew
then
what
it
must
be
when
the
great
curtain
shuts
out
suddenly
the
light
of
day
the
stars
and
the
firmament
itself
i
see
the
blind
man
eyes
strain
for
the
light
as
he
fearfully
tries
to
walk
his
old
rounds
until
the
unchanging
blank
that
everywhere
spreads
before
him
stamps
the
reality
of
the
dark
upon
his
consciousness
my
temporary
loss
of
smell
proved
to
me
too
that
the
absence
of
a
sense
need
not
dull
the
mental
faculties
and
does
not
distort
one
view
of
the
world
and
so
i
reason
that
blindness
and
deafness
need
not
pervert
the
inner
order
of
the
intellect
i
know
that
if
there
were
no
odours
for
me
i
should
still
possess
a
considerable
part
of
the
world
novelties
and
surprises
would
abound
adventures
would
thicken
in
the
dark
in
my
classification
of
the
senses
smell
is
a
little
the
inferior
and
touch
is
a
great
deal
the
eye
superior
i
find
that
great
artists
and
philosophers
agree
with
me
in
this

a

i
have
never
seen
sends
me
a
quotation
from
renaissance
in
italy
lorenzo
ghiberti
after
describing
a
piece
of
antique
sculpture
he
saw
in
rome
adds
to
express
the
perfection
of
learning
mastery
and
art
displayed
in
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
language
its
more
exquisite
beauties
could
not
be
discovered
by
the
sight
but
only
by
the
touch
of
the
hand
passed
over
it
of
another
classic
marble
at
padua
he
says
this
statue
when
the
christian
faith
triumphed
was
hidden
in
that
place
by
some
gentle
soul
who
seeing
it
so
perfect
fashioned
with
art
so
wonderful
and
with
such
power
of
genius
and
being
moved
to
reverent
pity
caused
a
sepulchre
of
bricks
to
be
built
and
there
within
buried
the
statue
and
covered
it
with
a
broad
slab
of
stone
that
it
might
not
in
any
way
be
injured
it
has
very
many
sweet
beauties
which
the
eyes
alone
can
comprehend
not
either
by
strong
or
tempered
light
only
the
hand
by
touching
them
finds
them
out
hold
out
your
hands
to
feel
the
luxury
of
the
sunbeams
press
the
soft
blossoms
against
your
cheek
and
finger
their
graces
of
form
their
delicate
mutability
of
shape
their
pliancy
and
freshness
expose
your
face
to
the
aerial
floods
that
sweep
the
heavens
inhale
great
draughts
of
space
wonder
wonder
at
the
wind
unwearied
activity
pile
note
on
note
the
infinite
music
that
flows
increasingly
to
your
soul
from
the
tactual
sonorities
of
a
thousand
branches
and
tumbling
waters
how
can
the
world
be
shrivelled
when
this
most
profound
emotional
sense
touch
is
faithful
to
its
service
i
am
sure
that
if
a
fairy
bade
me
choose
between
the
sense
of
light
and
that
of
touch
i
would
not
part
with
the
warm
endearing
contact
of
human
hands
or
the
wealth
of
form
the
nobility
and
fullness
that
press
into
my
palms
footnote
c
i
found
that
of
the
senses
the
eye
is
the
most
superficial
the
ear
the
most
arrogant

the

voluptuous

the
most

the

viii
the
world
the
poets
have
taught
us
how
full
of
wonders
is
the
night
and
the
night
of
blindness
has
its
wonders
too
the
only
lightless
dark
is
the
night
of
ignorance
and
insensibility
we
differ
blind
and
seeing
one
from
another
not
in
our
senses
but
in
the
use
we
make
of
them
in
the
imagination
and
courage
with
which
we
seek
wisdom
beyond
our
senses
it
is
more
difficult
to
teach
ignorance
to
think
than
to
teach
an
intelligent
blind
man
to
see
the
grandeur
of
niagara
i
have
walked
with
people
whose
eyes
are
full
of
light
but
who
see
nothing
in
wood
sea
or
sky
nothing
in
city
streets
nothing
in
books
what
a
witless
masquerade
is
this
seeing
it
were
better
far
to
sail
forever
in
the
night
of
blindness
with
sense
and
feeling
and
mind
than
to
be
thus
content
with
the
mere
act
of
seeing
they
have
the
sunset
the
morning
skies
the
purple
of
distant
hills
yet
their
souls
voyage
through
this
enchanted
world
with
a
barren
stare
the
calamity
of
the
blind
is
immense
irreparable
but
it
does
not
take
away
our
share
of
the
things
that
count
service
friendship
humour
imagination
wisdom
it
is
the
secret
inner
will
that
controls
fate
we
are
capable
of
willing
to
be
good
of
loving
and
being
loved
of
thinking
to
the
end
that
we
may
be
wiser
we
possess
these
forces
equally
with
all
god
children
therefore
we
too
see
the
lightnings
and
hear
the
thunders
of
sinai
we
too
march
through
the
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
that
shall
be
glad
for
us
and
as
we
pass
god
maketh
the
desert
to
blossom
like
the
rose
we
too
go
in
unto
the
promised
land
to
possess
the
treasures
of
the
spirit
the
unseen
permanence
of
life
and
nature
the
blind
man
of
spirit
faces
the
unknown
and
grapples
with
it
and
what
else
does
the
world
of
seeing
men
do
he
has
imagination
sympathy
humanity
and
these
ineradicable
existences
compel
him
to
share
by
a
sort
of
proxy
in
a
sense
he
has
not
when
he
meets
terms
of
colour
light
physiognomy
he
guesses
divines
puzzles
out
their
meaning
by
analogies
drawn
from
the
senses
he
has
i
naturally
tend
to
think
reason
draw
inferences
as
if
i
had
five
senses
instead
of
three
this
tendency
is
beyond
my
control
it
is
involuntary
habitual
instinctive
i
can
not
compel
my
mind
to
say
i
feel
instead
of
i
see
or
i
hear
the
word
feel
proves
on
examination
to
be
no
less
a
convention
than
see
and
hear
when
i
seek
for
words
accurately
to
describe
the
outward
things
that
affect
my
three
bodily
senses
when
a
man
loses
a
leg
his
brain
persists
in
impelling
him
to
use
what
he
has
not
and
yet
feels
to
be
there
can
it
be
that
the
brain
is
so
constituted
that
it
will
continue
the
activity
which
animates
the
sight
and
the
hearing
after
the
eye
and
the
ear
have
been
destroyed
it
might
seem
that
the
five
senses
would
work
intelligently
together
only
when
resident
in
the
same
body
yet
when
two
or
three
are
left
unaided
they
reach
out
for
their
complements
in
another
body
and
find
that
they
yoke
easily
with
the
borrowed
team
when
my
hand
aches
from
overtouching
i
find
relief
in
the
sight
of
another
when
my
mind
lags
wearied
with
the
strain
of
forcing
out
thoughts
about
dark
musicless
colourless
detached
substance
it
recovers
its
elasticity
as
soon
as
i
resort
to
the
powers
of
another
mind
which
commands
light
harmony
colour
now
if
the
five
senses
will
not
remain
disassociated
the
life
of
the
can
not
be
severed
from
the
life
of
the
seeing
hearing
race
the
person
may
be
plunged
and
replunged
like
diver
into
seas
of
the
unknown
but
unlike
the
doomed
hero
he
returns
triumphant
grasping
the
priceless
truth
that
his
mind
is
not
crippled
not
limited
to
the
infirmity
of
his
senses
the
world
of
the
eye
and
the
ear
becomes
to
him
a
subject
of
fateful
interest
he
seizes
every
word
of
sight
and
hearing
because
his
sensations
compel
it
light
and
colour
of
which
he
has
no
tactual
evidence
he
studies
fearlessly
believing
that
all
humanly
knowable
truth
is
open
to
him
he
is
in
a
position
similar
to
that
of
the
astronomer
who
firm
patient
watches
a
star
night
after
night
for
many
years
and
feels
rewarded
if
he
discovers
a
single
fact
about
it
the
man
to
ordinary
outward
things
and
the
man
to
the
immeasurable
universe
are
both
limited
by
time
and
space
but
they
have
made
a
compact
to
wring
service
from
their
limitations
the
bulk
of
the
world
knowledge
is
an
imaginary
construction
history
is
but
a
mode
of
imagining
of
making
us
see
civilizations
that
no
longer
appear
upon
the
earth
some
of
the
most
significant
discoveries
in
modern
science
owe
their
origin
to
the
imagination
of
men
who
had
neither
accurate
knowledge
nor
exact
instruments
to
demonstrate
their
beliefs
if
astronomy
had
not
kept
always
in
advance
of
the
telescope
no
one
would
ever
have
thought
a
telescope
worth
making
what
great
invention
has
not
existed
in
the
inventor
mind
long
before
he
gave
it
tangible
shape
a
more
splendid
example
of
imaginative
knowledge
is
the
unity
with
which
philosophers
start
their
study
of
the
world
they
can
never
perceive
the
world
in
its
entire
reality
yet
their
imagination
with
its
magnificent
allowance
for
error
its
power
of
treating
uncertainty
as
negligible
has
pointed
the
way
for
empirical
knowledge
in
their
highest
creative
moments
the
great
poet
the
great
musician
cease
to
use
the
crude
instruments
of
sight
and
hearing
they
break
away
from
their
rise
on
strong
compelling
wings
of
spirit
far
above
our
misty
hills
and
darkened
valleys
into
the
region
of
light
music
intellect
what
eye
hath
seen
the
glories
of
the
new
jerusalem
what
ear
hath
heard
the
music
of
the
spheres
the
steps
of
time
the
strokes
of
chance
the
blows
of
death
men
have
not
heard
with
their
physical
sense
the
tumult
of
sweet
voices
above
the
hills
of
judea
nor
seen
the
heavenly
vision
but
millions
have
listened
to
that
spiritual
message
through
many
ages
our
blindness
changes
not
a
whit
the
course
of
inner
realities
of
us
it
is
as
true
as
it
is
of
the
seeing
that
the
most
beautiful
world
is
always
entered
through
the
imagination
if
you
wish
to
be
something
that
you
are
not
something
fine
noble
good
you
shut
your
eyes
and
for
one
dreamy
moment
you
are
that
which
you
long
to
be
inward
visions
ix
inward
visions
according
to
all
art
all
nature
all
coherent
human
thought
we
know
that
order
proportion
form
are
essential
elements
of
beauty
now
order
proportion
and
form
are
palpable
to
the
touch
but
beauty
and
rhythm
are
deeper
than
sense
they
are
like
love
and
faith
they
spring
out
of
a
spiritual
process
only
slightly
dependent
upon
sensations
order
proportion
form
can
not
generate
in
the
mind
the
abstract
idea
of
beauty
unless
there
is
already
a
soul
intelligence
to
breathe
life
into
the
elements
many
persons
having
perfect
eyes
are
blind
in
their
perceptions
many
persons
having
perfect
ears
are
emotionally
deaf
yet
these
are
the
very
ones
who
dare
to
set
limits
to
the
vision
of
those
who
lacking
a
sense
or
two
have
will
soul
passion
imagination
faith
is
a
mockery
if
it
teaches
us
not
that
we
may
construct
a
world
unspeakably
more
complete
and
beautiful
than
the
material
world
and
i
too
may
construct
my
better
world
for
i
am
a
child
of
god
an
inheritor
of
a
fragment
of
the
mind
that
created
all
worlds
there
is
a
consonance
of
all
things
a
blending
of
all
that
we
know
about
the
material
world
and
the
spiritual
it
consists
for
me
of
all
the
impressions
vibrations
heat
cold
taste
smell
and
the
sensations
which
these
convey
to
the
mind
infinitely
combined
interwoven
with
associated
ideas
and
acquired
knowledge
no
thoughtful
person
will
believe
that
what
i
said
about
the
meaning
of
footsteps
is
strictly
true
of
mere
jolts
and
jars
it
is
an
array
of
the
spiritual
in
certain
natural
elements
tactual
beats
and
an
acquired
knowledge
of
physical
habits
and
moral
traits
of
highly
organized
human
beings
what
would
odours
signify
if
they
were
not
associated
with
the
time
of
the
year
the
place
i
live
in
and
the
people
i
know
the
result
of
such
a
blending
is
sometimes
a
discordant
trying
of
strings
far
removed
from
a
melody
very
far
from
a
symphony
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
must
be
reassured
i
will
say
that
i
have
felt
a
musician
tuning
his
violin
that
i
have
read
about
a
symphony
and
so
have
a
fair
intellectual
perception
of
my
metaphor
but
with
training
and
experience
the
faculties
gather
up
the
stray
notes
and
combine
them
into
a
full
harmonious
whole
if
the
person
who
accomplishes
this
task
is
peculiarly
gifted
we
call
him
a
poet
the
blind
and
the
deaf
are
not
great
poets
it
is
true
yet
now
and
again
you
find
one
deaf
and
blind
who
has
attained
to
his
royal
kingdom
of
beauty
i
have
a
little
volume
of
poems
by
a
lady
madame
bertha
galeron
her
poetry
has
versatility
of
thought
now
it
is
tender
and
sweet
now
full
of
tragic
passion
and
the
sternness
of
destiny
victor

voyante
she
has
written
several
plays
two
of
which
have
been
acted
in

the

academy

her
work
the
infinite
wonders
of
the
universe
are
revealed
to
us
in
exact
measure
as
we
are
capable
of
receiving
them
the
keenness
of
our
vision
depends
not
on
how
much
we
can
see
but
on
how
much
we
feel
nor
yet
does
mere
knowledge
create
beauty
nature

her

exquisite

her

am
i
to
be
denied
the
use
of
such
adjectives
as
freshness
and

dark
and
gloomy
i
have
walked
in
the
fields
at
early
morning
i
have
felt
a
laden
with
dew
and
fragrance
i
have
felt
the
curves
and
graces
of
my
kitten
at
play
i
have
known
the
sweet
shy
ways
of
little

i
have
known
the
sad
opposites
of
all
these

remember
i
have
sometimes
travelled
over
a
dusty
road
as
far
as
my
feet
could
go
at
a
sudden
turn
i
have
stepped
upon
starved
ignoble
weeds
and
reaching
out
my
hands
i
have
touched
a
fair
tree
out
of
which
a
parasite
had
taken
the
life
like
a
vampire
i
have
touched
a
pretty
bird
whose
soft
wings
hung
limp
whose
little
heart
beat
no
more
i
have
wept
over
the
feebleness
and
deformity
of
a
child
lame
or
born
blind
or
worse
still
mindless
if
i
had
the
genius
of
thomson
i
too
could
depict
a
city
of
dreadful
night
from
mere
touch
sensations
from
contrasts
so
irreconcilable
can
we
fail
to
form
an
idea
of
beauty
and
know
surely
when
we
meet
with
loveliness

upon
my
rugged
steep
yet
unto
me
thy
life
is
but
a
day
when
i
recall
the
things
that
i
have
seen
the
forest
monarchs
that
have
passed
away
upon
the
spot
where
first
i
saw
thy
green
for
i
am
older
than
the
age
of
man
or
all
the
living
things
that
crawl
or
creep
or
birds
of
air
or
creatures
of
the
deep
i
was
the
first
dim
outline
of
god
plan
only
the
waters
of
the
restless
sea
and
the
infinite
stars
in
heaven
are
old
to
me
i
am
glad
my
friend
stedman
knew
that
poem
while
he
was
making
his
anthology
for
knowing
it
so
fine
a
poet
and
critic
could
not
fail
to
give
it
a
place
in
his
of
american
poetry
the
poet
clarence
hawkes
has
been
blind
since
childhood
yet
he
finds
in
nature
hints
of
combinations
for
his
mental
pictures
out
of
the
knowledge
and
impressions
that
come
to
him
he
constructs
a
masterpiece
which
hangs
upon
the
walls
of
his
thought
and
into
the
poet
house
come
all
the
true
spirits
of
the
world
it
was
a
rare
poet
who
thought
of
the
mountain
as
the
first
dim
outline
of
god
plan
that
is
the
real
wonder
of
the
poem
and
not
that
a
blind
man
should
speak
so
confidently
of
sky
and
sea
our
ideas
of
the
sky
are
an
accumulation
of
literary
allusions
and
the
observations
of
others
with
an
emotional
blending
of
all
my
face
feels
only
a
tiny
portion
of
the
atmosphere
but
i
go
through
continuous
space
and
feel
the
air
at
every
point
every
instant
i
have
been
told
about
the
distances
from
our
earth
to
the
sun
to
the
other
planets
and
to
the
fixed
stars
i
multiply
a
thousand
times
the
utmost
height
and
width
that
my
touch
compasses
and
thus
i
gain
a
deep
sense
of
the
immensity
move
me
along
constantly
over
water
water
nothing
but
water
and
you
give
me
the
solitude
the
vastness
of
ocean
which
fills
the
eye
i
have
been
in
a
little
on
the
sea
when
the
rising
tide
swept
it
toward
the
shore
may
i
not
understand
the
poet
figure
the
green
of
spring
overflows
the
earth
like
a
tide
i
have
felt
the
flame
of
a
candle
blow
and
flutter
in
the
breeze
may
i
not
then
say
myriads
of
fireflies
flit
hither
and
thither
in
the
grass
like
little
fluttering
tapers
combine
the
endless
space
of
air
the
sun
warmth
the
clouds
that
are
described
to
my
understanding
spirit
the
frequent
breaking
through
the
soil
of
a
brook
or
the
expanse
of
the
lake
the
tactual
undulation
of
the
hills
which
i
recall
when
i
am
far
away
from
them
the
towering
trees
upon
trees
as
i
walk
by
them
the
bearings
that
i
try
to
keep
while
others
tell
me
the
directions
of
the
various
points
of
the
scenery
and
you
will
begin
to
feel
surer
of
my
mental
landscape
the
utmost
bound
to
which
my
thought
will
go
with
clearness
is
the
horizon
of
my
mind
from
this
horizon
i
imagine
the
one
which
the
eye
marks
touch
can
not
bridge
distance
it
is
fit
only
for
the
contact
of
surfaces
but
thought
leaps
the
chasm
for
this
reason
i
am
able
to
use
words
descriptive
of
objects
distant
from
my
senses
i
have
felt
the
rondure
of
the
infant
tender
form
i
can
apply
this
perception
to
the
landscape
and
to
the
hills
analogies
in
sense
perception
x
analogies
in
sense
perception
i
have
not
touched
the
outline
of
a
star
nor
the
glory
of
the
moon
but
i
believe
that
god
has
set
two
lights
in
mind
the
greater
to
rule
by
day
and
the
lesser
by
night
and
by
them
i
know
that
i
am
able
to
navigate
my
as
certain
of
reaching
the
haven
as
he
who
steers
by
the
north
star
perhaps
my
sun
shines
not
as
yours
the
colours
that
glorify
my
world
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
green
of
the
fields
may
not
correspond
exactly
with
those
you
delight
in
but
they
are
none
the
less
colour
to
me
the
sun
does
not
shine
for
my
physical
eyes
nor
does
the
lightning
flash
nor
do
the
trees
turn
green
in
the
spring
but
they
have
not
therefore
ceased
to
exist
any
more
than
the
landscape
is
annihilated
when
you
turn
your
back
on
it
i
understand
how
scarlet
can
differ
from
crimson
because
i
know
that
the
smell
of
an
orange
is
not
the
smell
of
a
i
can
also
conceive
that
colours
have
shades
and
guess
what
shades
are
in
smell
and
taste
there
are
varieties
not
broad
enough
to
be
fundamental
so
i
call
them
shades
there
are
half
a
dozen
roses
near
me
they
all
have
the
unmistakable
rose
scent
yet
my
nose
tells
me
that
they
are
not
the
same
the
american
beauty
is
distinct
from
the
jacqueminot
and
la
france
odours
in
certain
grasses
fade
as
really
to
my
sense
as
certain
colours
do
to
yours
in
the
sun
the
freshness
of
a
flower
in
my
hand
is
analogous
to
the
freshness
i
taste
in
an
apple
newly
picked
i
make
use
of
analogies
like
these
to
enlarge
my
conceptions
of
colours
some
analogies
which
i
draw
between
qualities
in
surface
and
vibration
taste
and
smell
are
drawn
by
others
between
sight
hearing
and
touch
this
fact
encourages
me
to
persevere
to
try
and
bridge
the
gap
between
the
eye
and
the
hand
certainly
i
get
far
enough
to
sympathize
with
the
delight
that
my
kind
feel
in
beauty
they
see
and
harmony
they
hear
this
bond
between
humanity
and
me
is
worth
keeping
even
if
the
idea
on
which
i
base
it
prove
erroneous
sweet
beautiful
vibrations
exist
for
my
touch
even
though
they
travel
through
other
substances
than
air
to
reach
me
so
i
imagine
sweet
delightful
sounds
and
the
artistic
arrangement
of
them
which
is
called
music
and
i
remember
that
they
travel
through
the
air
to
the
ear
conveying
impressions
somewhat
like
mine
i
also
know
what
tones
are
since
they
are
perceptible
tactually
in
a
voice
now
heat
varies
greatly
in
the
sun
in
the
fire
in
hands
and
in
the
fur
of
animals
indeed
there
is
such
a
thing
for
me
as
a
cold
sun
so
i
think
of
the
varieties
of
light
that
touch
the
eye
cold
and
warm
vivid
and
dim
soft
and
glaring
but
always
light
and
i
imagine
their
passage
through
the
air
to
an
extensive
sense
instead
of
to
a
narrow
one
like
touch
from
the
experience
i
have
had
with
voices
i
guess
how
the
eye
distinguishes
shades
in
the
midst
of
light
while
i
read
the
lips
of
a
woman
whose
voice
is
soprano
i
note
a
low
tone
or
a
glad
tone
in
the
midst
of
a
high
flowing
voice
when
i
feel
my
cheeks
hot
i
know
that
i
am
red
i
have
talked
so
much
and
read
so
much
about
colours
that
through
no
will
of
my
own
i
attach
meanings
to
them
just
as
all
people
attach
certain
meanings
to
abstract
terms
like
hope
idealism
monotheism
intellect
which
can
not
be
represented
truly
by
visible
objects
but
which
are
understood
from
analogies
between
immaterial
concepts
and
the
ideas
they
awaken
of
external
things
the
force
of
association
drives
me
to
say
that
white
is
exalted
and
pure
green
is
exuberant
red
suggests
love
or
shame
or
strength
without
the
colour
or
its
equivalent
life
to
me
would
be
dark
barren
a
vast
blackness
thus
through
an
inner
law
of
completeness
my
thoughts
are
not
permitted
to
remain
colourless
it
strains
my
mind
to
separate
colour
and
sound
from
objects
since
my
education
began
i
have
always
had
things
described
to
me
with
their
colours
and
sounds
by
one
with
keen
senses
and
a
fine
feeling
for
the
significant
therefore
i
habitually
think
of
things
as
coloured
and
resonant
habit
accounts
for
part
the
soul
sense
accounts
for
another
part
the
brain
with
its
construction
asserts
its
right
and
accounts
for
the
rest
inclusive
of
all
the
unity
of
the
world
demands
that
colour
be
kept
in
it
whether
i
have
cognizance
of
it
or
not
rather
than
be
shut
out
i
take
part
in
it
by
discussing
it
imagining
it
happy
in
the
happiness
of
those
near
me
who
gaze
at
the
lovely
hues
of
the
sunset
or
the
rainbow
my
hand
has
its
share
in
this
multiple
knowledge
but
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
with
the
fingers
i
see
only
a
very
small
portion
of
a
surface
and
that
i
must
pass
my
hand
continually
over
it
before
my
touch
grasps
the
whole
it
is
still
more
important
however
to
remember
that
my
imagination
is
not
tethered
to
certain
points
locations
and
distances
it
puts
all
the
parts
together
simultaneously
as
if
it
saw
or
knew
instead
of
feeling
them
though
i
feel
only
a
small
part
of
my
horse
at
a
time
my
horse
is
nervous
and
does
not
submit
to
manual
explorations
yet
because
i
have
many
times
felt
hock
nose
hoof
and
mane
i
can
see
the
steeds
of
phoebus
apollo
coursing
the
heavens
with
such
a
power
active
it
is
impossible
that
my
thought
should
be
vague
indistinct
it
must
needs
be
potent
definite
this
is
really
a
corollary
of
the
philosophical
truth
that
the
real
world
exists
only
for
the
mind
that
is
to
say
i
can
never
touch
the
world
in
its
entirety
indeed
i
touch
less
of
it
than
the
portion
that
others
see
or
hear
but
all
creatures
all
objects
pass
into
my
brain
entire
and
occupy
the
same
extent
there
that
they
do
in
material
space
i
declare
that
for
me
branched
thoughts
instead
of
pines
wave
sway
rustle
make
musical
the
ridges
of
mountains
rising
summit
upon
summit
mention
a
rose
too
far
away
for
me
to
smell
it
straightway
a
scent
steals
into
my
nostril
a
form
presses
against
my
palm
in
all
its
dilating
softness
with
rounded
petals
slightly
curled
edges
curving
stem
leaves
drooping
when
i
would
fain
view
the
world
as
a
whole
it
rushes
into
vision
man
beast
bird
reptile
fly
sky
ocean
mountains
plain
rock
pebble
the
warmth
of
life
the
reality
of
creation
is
over
all
the
throb
of
human
hands
glossiness
of
fur
lithe
windings
of
long
bodies
poignant
buzzing
of
insects
the
ruggedness
of
the
steeps
as
i
climb
them
the
liquid
mobility
and
boom
of
waves
upon
the
rocks
strange
to
say
try
as
i
may
i
can
not
force
my
touch
to
pervade
this
universe
in
all
directions
the
moment
i
try
the
whole
vanishes
only
small
objects
or
narrow
portions
of
a
surface
mere
a
chaos
of
things
scattered
at
random
remain
no
thrill
no
delight
is
excited
thereby
restore
to
the
artistic
comprehensive
internal
sense
its
rightful
domain
and
you
give
me
joy
which
best
proves
the
reality
before
the
soul
dawn
xi
before
the
soul
dawn
before
my
teacher
came
to
me
i
did
not
know
that
i
am
i
lived
in
a
world
that
was
a
i
can
not
hope
to
describe
adequately
that
unconscious
yet
conscious
time
of
nothingness
i
did
not
know
that
i
knew
aught
or
that
i
lived
or
acted
or
desired
i
had
neither
will
nor
intellect
i
was
carried
along
to
objects
and
acts
by
a
certain
blind
natural
impetus
i
had
a
mind
which
caused
me
to
feel
anger
satisfaction
desire
these
two
facts
led
those
about
me
to
suppose
that
i
willed
and
thought
i
can
remember
all
this
not
because
i
knew
that
it
was
so
but
because
i
have
tactual
memory
it
enables
me
to
remember
that
i
never
contracted
my
forehead
in
the
act
of
thinking
i
never
viewed
anything
beforehand
or
chose
it
i
also
recall
tactually
the
fact
that
never
in
a
start
of
the
body
or
a
did
i
feel
that
i
loved
or
cared
for
anything
my
inner
life
then
was
a
blank
without
past
present
or
future
without
hope
or
anticipation
without
wonder
or
joy
or
faith
it
was
not
night
it
was
not
day
but
vacancy
absorbing
space
and
fixedness
without
a
place
there
were
no
stars
no
earth
no
time
no
check
no
change
no
good
no
crime
my
dormant
being
had
no
idea
of
god
or
immortality
no
fear
of
death
i
remember
also
through
touch
that
i
had
a
power
of
association
i
felt
tactual
jars
like
the
stamp
of
a
foot
the
opening
of
a
window
or
its
closing
the
slam
of
a
door
after
repeatedly
smelling
rain
and
feeling
the
discomfort
of
wetness
i
acted
like
those
about
me
i
ran
to
shut
the
window
but
that
was
not
thought
in
any
sense
it
was
the
same
kind
of
association
that
makes
animals
take
shelter
from
the
rain
from
the
same
instinct
of
aping
others
i
folded
the
clothes
that
came
from
the
laundry
and
put
mine
away
fed
the
turkeys
sewed
on
my
doll
face
and
did
many
other
things
of
which
i
have
the
tactual
remembrance
when
i
wanted
anything
i
liked
for
instance
of
which
i
was
very
fond
i
had
a
delicious
taste
on
my
tongue
which
by
the
way
i
never
have
now
and
in
my
hand
i
felt
the
turning
of
the
freezer
i
made
the
sign
and
my
mother
knew
i
wanted
i
thought
and
desired
in
my
fingers
if
i
had
made
a
man
i
should
certainly
have
put
the
brain
and
soul
in
his
from
reminiscences
like
these
i
conclude
that
it
is
the
opening
of
the
two
faculties
freedom
of
will
or
choice
and
rationality
or
the
power
of
thinking
from
one
thing
to
another
which
makes
it
possible
to
come
into
being
first
as
a
child
afterwards
as
a
man
since
i
had
no
power
of
thought
i
did
not
compare
one
mental
state
with
another
so
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
change
or
process
going
on
in
my
brain
when
my
teacher
began
to
instruct
me
i
merely
felt
keen
delight
in
obtaining
more
easily
what
i
wanted
by
means
of
the
finger
motions
she
taught
me
i
thought
only
of
objects
and
only
objects
i
wanted
it
was
the
turning
of
the
freezer
on
a
larger
scale
when
i
learned
the
meaning
of
i
and
me
and
found
that
i
was
something
i
began
to
think
then
consciousness
first
existed
for
me
thus
it
was
not
the
sense
of
touch
that
brought
me
knowledge
it
was
the
awakening
of
my
soul
that
first
rendered
my
senses
their
value
their
cognizance
of
objects
names
qualities
and
properties
thought
made
me
conscious
of
love
joy
and
all
the
emotions
i
was
eager
to
know
then
to
understand
afterward
to
reflect
on
what
i
knew
and
understood
and
the
blind
impetus
which
had
before
driven
me
hither
and
thither
at
the
dictates
of
my
sensations
vanished
forever
i
can
not
represent
more
clearly
than
any
one
else
the
gradual
and
subtle
changes
from
first
impressions
to
abstract
ideas
but
i
know
that
my
physical
ideas
that
is
ideas
derived
from
material
objects
appear
to
me
first
an
idea
similar
to
those
of
touch
instantly
they
pass
into
intellectual
meanings
afterward
the
meaning
finds
expression
in
what
is
called
inner
speech
when
i
was
a
child
my
inner
speech
was
inner
spelling
although
i
am
even
now
frequently
caught
spelling
to
myself
on
my
fingers
yet
i
talk
to
myself
too
with
my
lips
and
it
is
true
that
when
i
first
learned
to
speak
my
mind
discarded
the
and
began
to
articulate
however
when
i
try
to
recall
what
some
one
has
said
to
me
i
am
conscious
of
a
hand
spelling
into
mine
it
has
often
been
asked
what
were
my
earliest
impressions
of
the
world
in
which
i
found
myself
but
one
who
thinks
at
all
of
his
first
impressions
knows
what
a
riddle
this
is
our
impressions
grow
and
change
unnoticed
so
that
what
we
suppose
we
thought
as
children
may
be
quite
different
from
what
we
actually
experienced
in
our
childhood
i
only
know
that
after
my
education
began
the
world
which
came
within
my
reach
was
all
alive
i
spelled
to
my
blocks
and
my
dogs
i
sympathized
with
plants
when
the
flowers
were
picked
because
i
thought
it
hurt
them
and
that
they
grieved
for
their
lost
blossoms
it
was
two
years
before
i
could
be
made
to
believe
that
my
dogs
did
not
understand
what
i
said
and
i
always
apologized
to
them
when
i
ran
into
or
stepped
on
them
as
my
experiences
broadened
and
deepened
the
indeterminate
poetic
feelings
of
childhood
began
to
fix
themselves
in
definite
thoughts
nature
the
world
i
could
touch
was
folded
and
filled
with
myself
i
am
inclined
to
believe
those
philosophers
who
declare
that
we
know
nothing
but
our
own
feelings
and
ideas
with
a
little
ingenious
reasoning
one
may
see
in
the
material
world
simply
a
mirror
an
image
of
permanent
mental
sensations
in
either
sphere
is
the
condition
and
the
limit
of
our
consciousness
that
is
why
perhaps
many
people
know
so
little
about
what
is
beyond
their
short
range
of
experience
they
look
within
themselves
and
find
nothing
therefore
they
conclude
that
there
is
nothing
outside
themselves
either
however
that
may
be
i
came
later
to
look
for
an
image
of
my
emotions
and
sensations
in
others
i
had
to
learn
the
outward
signs
of
inward
feelings
the
start
of
fear
the
suppressed
controlled
tensity
of
pain
the
beat
of
happy
muscles
in
others
had
to
be
perceived
and
compared
with
my
own
experiences
before
i
could
trace
them
back
to
the
intangible
soul
of
another
groping
uncertain
i
at
last
found
my
identity
and
after
seeing
my
thoughts
and
feelings
repeated
in
others
i
gradually
constructed
my
world
of
men
and
of
god
as
i
read
and
study
i
find
that
this
is
what
the
rest
of
the
race
has
done
man
looks
within
himself
and
in
time
finds
the
measure
and
the
meaning
of
the
universe
the
larger
sanctions
xii
the
larger
sanctions
so
in
the
midst
of
life
eager
imperious
life
the
child
fettered
to
the
bare
rock
of
circumstance
sends
out
gossamer
threads
of
thought
into
the
measureless
void
that
surrounds
him
patiently
he
explores
the
dark
until
he
builds
up
a
knowledge
of
the
world
he
lives
in
and
his
soul
meets
the
beauty
of
the
world
where
the
sun
shines
always
and
the
birds
sing
to
the
blind
child
the
dark
is
kindly
in
it
he
finds
nothing
extraordinary
or
terrible
it
is
his
familiar
world
even
the
groping
from
place
to
place
the
halting
steps
the
dependence
upon
others
do
not
seem
strange
to
him
he
does
not
know
how
many
countless
pleasures
the
dark
shuts
out
from
him
not
until
he
weighs
his
life
in
the
scale
of
others
experience
does
he
realize
what
it
is
to
live
forever
in
the
dark
but
the
knowledge
that
teaches
him
this
bitterness
also
brings
its
consolation
spiritual
light
the
promise
of
the
day
that
shall
be
the
blind
child
the
child
has
inherited
the
mind
of
seeing
and
hearing
ancestors
a
mind
measured
to
five
senses
therefore
he
must
be
influenced
even
if
it
be
unknown
to
himself
by
the
light
colour
song
which
have
been
transmitted
through
the
language
he
is
taught
for
the
chambers
of
the
mind
are
ready
to
receive
that
language
the
brain
of
the
race
is
so
permeated
with
colour
that
it
dyes
even
the
speech
of
the
blind
every
object
i
think
of
is
stained
with
the
hue
that
belongs
to
it
by
association
and
memory
the
experience
of
the
person
in
a
world
of
seeing
hearing
people
is
like
that
of
a
sailor
on
an
island
where
the
inhabitants
speak
a
language
unknown
to
him
whose
life
is
unlike
that
he
has
lived
he
is
one
they
are
many
there
is
no
chance
of
compromise
he
must
learn
to
see
with
their
eyes
to
hear
with
their
ears
to
think
their
thoughts
to
follow
their
ideals
if
the
dark
silent
world
which
surrounds
him
were
essentially
different
from
the
sunlit
resonant
world
it
would
be
incomprehensible
to
his
kind
and
could
never
be
discussed
if
his
feelings
and
sensations
were
fundamentally
different
from
those
of
others
they
would
be
inconceivable
except
to
those
who
had
similar
sensations
and
feelings
if
the
mental
consciousness
of
the
person
were
absolutely
dissimilar
to
that
of
his
fellows
he
would
have
no
means
of
imagining
what
they
think
since
the
mind
of
the
sightless
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
the
seeing
in
that
it
admits
of
no
lack
it
must
supply
some
sort
of
equivalent
for
missing
physical
sensations
it
must
perceive
a
likeness
between
things
outward
and
things
inward
a
correspondence
between
the
seen
and
the
unseen
i
make
use
of
such
a
correspondence
in
many
relations
and
no
matter
how
far
i
pursue
it
to
things
i
can
not
see
it
does
not
break
under
the
test
as
a
working
hypothesis
correspondence
is
adequate
to
all
life
through
the
whole
range
of
phenomena
the
flash
of
thought
and
its
swiftness
explain
the
lightning
flash
and
the
sweep
of
a
comet
through
the
heavens
my
mental
sky
opens
to
me
the
vast
celestial
spaces
and
i
proceed
to
fill
them
with
the
images
of
my
spiritual
stars
i
recognize
truth
by
the
clearness
and
guidance
that
it
gives
my
thought
and
knowing
what
that
clearness
is
i
can
imagine
what
light
is
to
the
eye
it
is
not
a
convention
of
language
but
a
forcible
feeling
of
the
reality
that
at
times
makes
me
start
when
i
say
oh
i
see
my
mistake
or
how
dark
cheerless
is
his
life
i
know
these
are
metaphors
still
i
must
prove
with
them
since
there
is
nothing
in
our
language
to
replace
them
metaphors
to
correspond
do
not
exist
and
are
not
necessary
because
i
can
understand
the
word
reflect
figuratively
a
mirror
has
never
perplexed
me
the
manner
in
which
my
imagination
perceives
absent
things
enables
me
to
see
how
glasses
can
magnify
things
bring
them
nearer
or
remove
them
farther
deny
me
this
correspondence
this
internal
sense
confine
me
to
the
fragmentary
incoherent
and
lo
i
become
as
a
bat
which
wanders
about
on
the
wing
suppose
i
omitted
all
words
of
seeing
hearing
colour
light
landscape
the
thousand
phenomena
instruments
and
beauties
connected
with
them
i
should
suffer
a
great
diminution
of
the
wonder
and
delight
in
attaining
knowledge
also
more
dreadful
loss
my
emotions
would
be
blunted
so
that
i
could
not
be
touched
by
things
unseen
has
anything
arisen
to
disprove
the
adequacy
of
correspondence
has
any
chamber
of
the
blind
man
brain
been
opened
and
found
empty
has
any
psychologist
explored
the
mind
of
the
sightless
and
been
able
to
say
there
is
no
sensation
here
i
tread
the
solid
earth
i
breathe
the
scented
air
out
of
these
two
experiences
i
form
numberless
associations
and
correspondences
i
observe
i
feel
i
think
i
imagine
i
associate
the
countless
varied
impressions
experiences
concepts
out
of
these
materials
fancy
the
cunning
artisan
of
the
brain
welds
an
image
which
the
sceptic
would
deny
me
because
i
can
not
see
with
my
physical
eyes
the
changeful
lovely
face
of
my
he
would
break
the
mind
mirror
this
would
humble
my
soul
and
force
me
to
bite
the
dust
of
material
things
while
i
champ
the
bit
of
circumstance
he
scourges
and
goads
me
with
the
spur
of
fact
if
i
heeded
him
the
earth
would
vanish
into
nothing
and
i
should
hold
in
my
hand
nought
but
an
aimless
soulless
lump
of
dead
matter
but
although
the
body
physical
is
rooted
alive
to
the
promethean
rock
the
huntress
of
the
air
will
still
pursue
the
shining
open
highways
of
the
universe
blindness
has
no
limiting
effect
upon
mental
vision
my
intellectual
horizon
is
infinitely
wide
the
universe
it
encircles
is
immeasurable
would
they
who
bid
me
keep
within
the
narrow
bound
of
my
meagre
senses
demand
of
herschel
that
he
roof
his
stellar
universe
and
give
us
back
plato
solid
firmament
of
glassy
spheres
would
they
command
darwin
from
the
grave
and
bid
him
blot
out
his
geological
time
give
us
back
a
paltry
few
thousand
years
oh
the
supercilious
doubters
they
ever
strive
to
clip
the
upward
daring
wings
of
the
spirit
a
person
deprived
of
one
or
more
senses
is
not
as
many
seem
to
think
turned
out
into
a
trackless
wilderness
without
landmark
or
guide
the
blind
man
carries
with
him
into
his
dark
environment
all
the
faculties
essential
to
the
apprehension
of
the
visible
world
whose
door
is
closed
behind
him
he
finds
his
surroundings
everywhere
homogeneous
with
those
of
the
sunlit
world
for
there
is
an
inexhaustible
ocean
of
likenesses
between
the
world
within
and
the
world
without
and
these
likenesses
these
correspondences
he
finds
equal
to
every
exigency
his
life
offers
the
necessity
of
some
such
thing
as
correspondence
or
symbolism
appears
more
and
more
urgent
as
we
consider
the
duties
that
religion
and
philosophy
enjoin
upon
us
the
blind
are
expected
to
read
the
bible
as
a
means
of
attaining
spiritual
happiness
now
the
bible
is
filled
throughout
with
references
to
clouds
stars
colours
and
beauty
and
often
the
mention
of
these
is
essential
to
the
meaning
of
the
parable
or
the
message
in
which
they
occur
here
one
must
needs
see
the
inconsistency
of
people
who
believe
in
the
bible
and
yet
deny
us
a
right
to
talk
about
what
we
do
not
see
and
for
that
matter
what
do
not
see
either
who
shall
forbid
my
heart
to
sing
yea
he
did
fly
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
he
made
darkness
his
secret
place
his
pavilion
round
about
him
were
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
philosophy
constantly
points
out
the
untrustworthiness
of
the
five
senses
and
the
important
work
of
reason
which
corrects
the
errors
of
sight
and
reveals
its
illusions
if
we
can
not
depend
on
five
senses
how
much
less
may
we
rely
on
three
what
ground
have
we
for
discarding
light
sound
and
colour
as
an
integral
part
of
our
world
how
are
we
to
know
that
they
have
ceased
to
exist
for
us
we
must
take
their
reality
for
granted
even
as
the
philosopher
assumes
the
reality
of
the
world
without
being
able
to
see
it
physically
as
a
whole
ancient
philosophy
offers
an
argument
which
seems
still
valid
there
is
in
the
blind
as
in
the
seeing
an
absolute
which
gives
truth
to
what
we
know
to
be
true
order
to
what
is
orderly
beauty
to
the
beautiful
touchableness
to
what
is
tangible
if
this
is
granted
it
follows
that
this
absolute
is
not
imperfect
incomplete
partial
it
must
needs
go
beyond
the
limited
evidence
of
our
sensations
and
also
give
light
to
what
is
invisible
music
to
the
musical
that
silence
dulls
thus
mind
itself
compels
us
to
acknowledge
that
we
are
in
a
world
of
intellectual
order
beauty
and
harmony
the
essences
or
absolutes
of
these
ideas
necessarily
dispel
their
opposites
which
belong
with
evil
disorder
and
discord
thus
deafness
and
blindness
do
not
exist
in
the
immaterial
mind
which
is
philosophically
the
real
world
but
are
banished
with
the
perishable
material
senses
reality
of
which
visible
things
are
the
symbol
shines
before
my
mind
while
i
walk
about
my
chamber
with
unsteady
steps
my
spirit
sweeps
skyward
on
eagle
wings
and
looks
out
with
unquenchable
vision
upon
the
world
of
eternal
beauty
the
dream
world
xiii
the
dream
world
everybody
takes
his
own
dreams
seriously
but
yawns
at
the
when
somebody
else
begins
to
tell
the
adventures
of
the
night
before
i
hesitate
therefore
to
enter
upon
an
account
of
my
dreams
for
it
is
a
literary
sin
to
bore
the
reader
and
a
scientific
sin
to
report
the
facts
of
a
far
country
with
more
regard
to
point
and
brevity
than
to
complete
and
literal
truth
the
psychologists
have
trained
a
pack
of
theories
and
facts
which
they
keep
in
leash
like
so
many
bulldogs
and
which
they
let
loose
upon
us
whenever
we
depart
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
dream
probability
one
may
not
even
tell
an
entertaining
dream
without
being
suspected
of
having
liberally
edited
it
as
if
editing
were
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
instead
of
a
useful
and
honourable
occupation
be
it
understood
then
that
i
am
discoursing
at
my
own
and
that
no
scientific
man
is
present
to
trip
the
autocrat
i
used
to
wonder
why
scientific
men
and
others
were
always
asking
me
about
my
dreams
but
i
am
not
surprised
now
since
i
have
discovered
what
some
of
them
believe
to
be
the
ordinary
waking
experience
of
one
who
is
both
deaf
and
blind
they
think
that
i
can
know
very
little
about
objects
even
a
few
feet
beyond
the
reach
of
my
arms
everything
outside
of
myself
according
to
them
is
a
hazy
blur
trees
mountains
cities
the
ocean
even
the
house
i
live
in
are
but
fairy
fabrications
misty
unrealities
therefore
it
is
assumed
that
my
dreams
should
have
peculiar
interest
for
the
man
of
science
in
some
undefined
way
it
is
expected
that
they
should
reveal
the
world
i
dwell
in
to
be
flat
formless
colourless
without
perspective
with
little
thickness
and
less
solidity
a
vast
solitude
of
soundless
space
but
who
shall
put
into
words
limitless
visionless
silent
void
one
should
be
a
disembodied
spirit
indeed
to
make
anything
out
of
such
insubstantial
experiences
a
world
or
a
dream
for
that
matter
to
be
comprehensible
to
us
must
i
should
think
have
a
warp
of
substance
woven
into
the
woof
of
fantasy
we
can
not
imagine
even
in
dreams
an
object
which
has
no
counterpart
in
reality
ghosts
always
resemble
somebody
and
if
they
do
not
appear
themselves
their
presence
is
indicated
by
circumstances
with
which
we
are
perfectly
familiar
during
sleep
we
enter
a
strange
mysterious
realm
which
science
has
thus
far
not
explored
beyond
the
of
slumber
the
investigator
may
not
pass
with
his
rule
and
test
sleep
with
softest
touch
locks
all
the
gates
of
our
physical
senses
and
lulls
to
rest
the
conscious
will
the
disciplinarian
of
our
waking
thoughts
then
the
spirit
wrenches
itself
free
from
the
sinewy
arms
of
reason
and
like
a
winged
courser
spurns
the
firm
green
earth
and
speeds
away
upon
wind
and
cloud
leaving
neither
trace
nor
footprint
by
which
science
may
track
its
flight
and
bring
us
knowledge
of
the
distant
shadowy
country
that
we
nightly
visit
when
we
come
back
from
the
we
can
give
no
reasonable
report
of
what
we
met
there
but
once
across
the
border
we
feel
at
home
as
if
we
had
always
lived
there
and
had
never
made
any
excursions
into
this
rational
daylight
world
my
dreams
do
not
seem
to
differ
very
much
from
the
dreams
of
other
people
some
of
them
are
coherent
and
safely
hitched
to
an
event
or
a
conclusion
others
are
inconsequent
and
fantastic
all
attest
that
in
dreamland
there
is
no
such
thing
as
repose
we
are
always
up
and
doing
with
a
mind
for
any
adventure
we
act
strive
think
suffer
and
are
glad
to
no
purpose
we
leave
outside
the
portals
of
sleep
all
troublesome
incredulities
and
vexatious
speculations
as
to
probability
i
float
upon
clouds
in
and
out
among
the
winds
without
the
faintest
notion
that
i
am
doing
anything
unusual
in
dreamland
i
find
little
that
is
altogether
strange
or
wholly
new
to
my
experience
no
matter
what
happens
i
am
not
astonished
however
extraordinary
the
circumstances
may
be
i
visit
a
foreign
land
where
i
have
not
been
in
reality
and
i
converse
with
peoples
whose
language
i
have
never
heard
yet
we
manage
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
into
whatsoever
situation
or
society
my
wanderings
bring
me
there
is
the
same
homogeneity
if
i
happen
into
vagabondia
i
make
merry
with
the
jolly
folk
of
the
road
or
the
tavern
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
met
persons
with
whom
i
could
not
at
once
communicate
or
to
have
been
shocked
or
surprised
at
the
doings
of
my
in
its
strange
wanderings
in
those
dusky
groves
of
slumberland
my
soul
takes
everything
for
granted
and
adapts
itself
to
the
wildest
phantoms
i
am
seldom
confused
everything
is
as
clear
as
day
i
know
events
the
instant
they
take
place
and
wherever
i
turn
my
steps
mind
is
my
faithful
guide
and
interpreter
i
suppose
every
one
has
had
in
a
dream
the
exasperating
profitless
experience
of
seeking
something
urgently
desired
at
the
moment
and
the
aching
weary
sensation
that
follows
each
failure
to
track
the
thing
to
its
sometimes
with
a
singing
dizziness
in
my
head
i
climb
and
climb
i
know
not
where
or
why
yet
i
can
not
quit
the
torturing
passionate
endeavour
though
again
and
again
i
reach
out
blindly
for
an
object
to
hold
to
of
course
according
to
the
perversity
of
dreams
there
is
no
object
near
i
clutch
empty
air
and
then
i
fall
downward
and
still
downward
and
in
the
midst
of
the
fall
i
dissolve
into
the
atmosphere
upon
which
i
have
been
floating
so
precariously
some
of
my
dreams
seem
to
be
traced
one
within
another
like
a
series
of
concentric
circles
in
sleep
i
think
i
can
not
sleep
i
toss
about
in
the
toils
of
tasks
unfinished
i
decide
to
get
up
and
read
for
a
while
i
know
the
shelf
in
my
library
where
i
keep
the
book
i
want
the
book
has
no
name
but
i
find
it
without
difficulty
i
settle
myself
comfortably
in
the
the
great
book
open
on
my
knee
not
a
word
can
i
make
out
the
pages
are
utterly
blank
i
am
not
surprised
but
keenly
disappointed
i
finger
the
pages
i
bend
over
them
lovingly
the
tears
fall
on
my
hands
i
shut
the
book
quickly
as
the
thought
passes
through
my
mind
the
print
will
be
all
rubbed
out
if
i
get
it
wet
yet
there
is
no
print
tangible
on
the
page
this
morning
i
thought
that
i
awoke
i
was
certain
that
i
had
overslept
i
seized
my
watch
and
sure
enough
it
pointed
to
an
hour
after
my
rising
time
i
sprang
up
in
the
greatest
hurry
knowing
that
breakfast
was
ready
i
called
my
mother
who
declared
that
my
watch
must
be
wrong
she
was
positive
it
could
not
be
so
late
i
looked
at
my
watch
again
and
lo
the
hands
wiggled
whirled
buzzed
and
disappeared
i
awoke
more
fully
as
my
dismay
grew
until
i
was
at
the
antipodes
of
sleep
finally
my
eyes
opened
actually
and
i
knew
that
i
had
been
dreaming
i
had
only
waked
into
sleep
what
is
still
more
bewildering
there
is
no
difference
between
the
consciousness
of
the
sham
waking
and
that
of
the
real
one
it
is
fearful
to
think
that
all
that
we
have
ever
seen
felt
read
and
done
may
suddenly
rise
to
our
as
the
sea
casts
up
objects
it
has
swallowed
i
have
held
a
little
child
in
my
arms
in
the
midst
of
a
riot
and
spoken
vehemently
imploring
the
russian
soldiers
not
to
massacre
the
jews
i
have
the
agonizing
scenes
of
the
sepoy
rebellion
and
the
french
revolution
cities
have
burned
before
my
eyes
and
i
have
fought
the
flames
until
i
fell
exhausted
holocausts
overtake
the
world
and
i
struggle
in
vain
to
save
my
friends
once
in
a
dream
a
message
came
speeding
over
land
and
sea
that
winter
was
descending
upon
the
world
from
the
north
pole
that
the
arctic
zone
was
shifting
to
our
mild
climate
far
and
wide
the
message
flew
the
ocean
was
congealed
in
midsummer
ships
were
held
fast
in
the
ice
by
thousands
the
ships
with
large
white
sails
were
held
fast
riches
of
the
orient
and
the
plenteous
harvests
of
the
golden
west
might
no
more
pass
between
nation
and
nation
for
some
time
the
trees
and
flowers
grew
on
despite
the
intense
cold
birds
flew
into
the
houses
for
safety
and
those
which
winter
had
overtaken
lay
on
the
snow
with
wings
spread
in
vain
flight
at
last
the
foliage
and
blossoms
fell
at
the
feet
of
winter
the
petals
of
the
flowers
were
turned
to
rubies
and
sapphires
the
leaves
froze
into
emeralds
the
trees
moaned
and
tossed
their
branches
as
the
frost
pierced
them
through
bark
and
sap
pierced
into
their
very
roots
i
shivered
myself
awake
and
with
a
tumult
of
joy
i
breathed
the
many
sweet
morning
odours
wakened
by
the
summer
sun
one
need
not
visit
an
african
jungle
or
an
indian
forest
to
hunt
the
tiger
one
can
lie
in
bed
amid
downy
pillows
and
dream
tigers
as
terrible
as
any
in
the
pathless
wild
i
was
a
little
girl
when
one
night
i
tried
to
cross
the
garden
in
front
of
my
aunt
house
in
alabama
i
was
in
pursuit
of
a
large
cat
with
a
great
bushy
tail
a
few
hours
before
he
had
clawed
my
little
canary
out
of
its
cage
and
crunched
it
between
his
cruel
teeth
i
could
not
see
the
cat
but
the
thought
in
my
mind
was
distinct
he
is
making
for
the
high
grass
at
the
end
of
the
garden
i
get
there
first
i
put
my
hand
on
the
box
border
and
ran
swiftly
along
the
path
when
i
reached
the
high
grass
there
was
the
cat
gliding
into
the
wavy
tangle
i
rushed
forward
and
tried
to
seize
him
and
take
the
bird
from
between
his
teeth
to
my
horror
a
huge
beast
not
the
cat
at
all
sprang
out
from
the
grass
and
his
sinewy
shoulder
rubbed
against
me
with
palpitating
strength
his
ears
stood
up
and
quivered
with
anger
his
eyes
were
hot
his
nostrils
were
large
and
wet
his
lips
moved
horribly
i
knew
it
was
a
tiger
a
real
live
tiger
and
that
i
should
be
devoured
my
little
bird
and
i
do
not
know
what
happened
after
that
the
next
important
thing
seldom
happens
in
dreams
some
time
earlier
i
had
a
dream
which
made
a
vivid
impression
upon
me
my
aunt
was
weeping
because
she
could
not
find
me
but
i
took
an
impish
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
she
and
others
were
searching
for
me
and
making
great
noise
which
i
felt
through
my
feet
suddenly
the
spirit
of
mischief
gave
way
to
uncertainty
and
fear
i
felt
cold
the
air
smelt
like
ice
and
salt
i
tried
to
run
but
the
long
grass
tripped
me
and
i
fell
forward
on
my
face
i
lay
very
still
feeling
with
all
my
body
after
a
while
my
sensations
seemed
to
be
concentrated
in
my
fingers
and
i
perceived
that
the
grass
blades
were
sharp
as
knives
and
hurt
my
hands
cruelly
i
tried
to
get
up
cautiously
so
as
not
to
cut
myself
on
the
sharp
grass
i
put
down
a
tentative
foot
much
as
my
kitten
treads
for
the
first
time
the
primeval
forest
in
the
backyard
all
at
once
i
felt
the
stealthy
patter
of
something
creeping
creeping
creeping
purposefully
toward
me
i
do
not
know
how
at
that
time
the
idea
was
in
my
mind
i
had
no
words
for
intention
or
purpose
yet
it
was
precisely
the
evil
intent
and
not
the
creeping
animal
that
terrified
me
i
had
no
fear
of
living
creatures
i
loved
my
father
dogs
the
frisky
little
calf
the
gentle
cows
the
horses
and
mules
that
ate
apples
from
my
hand
and
none
of
them
had
ever
harmed
me
i
lay
low
waiting
in
breathless
terror
for
the
creature
to
spring
and
bury
its
long
claws
in
my
flesh
i
thought
they
will
feel
like
something
warm
and
wet
touched
my
face
i
shrieked
struck
out
frantically
and
awoke
something
was
still
struggling
in
my
arms
i
held
on
with
might
and
main
until
i
was
exhausted
then
i
loosed
my
hold
i
found
dear
old
belle
the
setter
shaking
herself
and
looking
at
me
reproachfully
she
and
i
had
gone
to
sleep
together
on
the
rug
and
had
naturally
wandered
to
the
where
dogs
and
little
girls
hunt
wild
game
and
have
strange
adventures
we
encountered
hosts
of
elfin
foes
and
it
required
all
the
dog
tactics
at
belle
command
to
acquit
herself
like
the
lady
and
huntress
that
she
was
belle
had
her
dreams
too
we
used
to
lie
under
the
trees
and
flowers
in
the
old
garden
and
i
used
to
laugh
with
delight
when
the
magnolia
leaves
fell
with
little
thuds
and
belle
jumped
up
thinking
she
had
heard
a
partridge
she
would
pursue
the
leaf
point
it
bring
it
back
to
me
and
lay
it
at
my
feet
with
a
humorous
wag
of
her
tail
as
much
as
to
say
this
is
the
kind
of
bird
that
waked
me
i
made
a
chain
for
her
neck
out
of
the
lovely
blue
paulownia
flowers
and
covered
her
with
great
leaves
dear
old
belle
she
has
long
been
dreaming
among
the
and
poppies
of
the
dogs
paradise
certain
dreams
have
haunted
me
since
my
childhood
one
which
recurs
often
proceeds
after
this
wise
a
spirit
seems
to
pass
before
my
face
i
feel
an
extreme
heat
like
the
blast
from
an
engine
it
is
the
embodiment
of
evil
i
must
have
had
it
first
after
the
day
that
i
nearly
got
burnt
another
spirit
which
visits
me
often
brings
a
sensation
of
cool
dampness
such
as
one
feels
on
a
chill
november
night
when
the
window
is
open
the
spirit
stops
just
beyond
my
reach
sways
back
and
forth
like
a
creature
in
grief
my
blood
is
chilled
and
seems
to
freeze
in
my
veins
i
try
to
move
but
my
body
is
still
and
i
can
not
even
cry
out
after
a
while
the
spirit
passes
on
and
i
say
to
myself
shudderingly
that
was
death
i
wonder
if
he
has
taken
her
the
pronoun
stands
for
my
teacher
in
my
dreams
i
have
sensations
odours
tastes
and
ideas
which
i
do
not
remember
to
have
had
in
reality
perhaps
they
are
the
glimpses
which
my
mind
catches
through
the
veil
of
sleep
of
my
earliest
babyhood
i
have
heard
the
trampling
of
many
waters
sometimes
a
wonderful
light
visits
me
in
sleep
such
a
flash
and
glory
as
it
is
i
gaze
and
gaze
until
it
vanishes
i
smell
and
taste
much
as
in
my
waking
hours
but
the
sense
of
touch
plays
a
less
important
part
in
sleep
i
almost
never
grope
no
one
guides
me
even
in
a
crowded
street
i
am
and
i
enjoy
an
independence
quite
foreign
to
my
physical
life
now
i
seldom
spell
on
my
fingers
and
it
is
still
rarer
for
others
to
spell
into
my
hand
my
mind
acts
independent
of
my
physical
organs
i
am
delighted
to
be
thus
endowed
if
only
in
sleep
for
then
my
soul
dons
its
winged
sandals
and
joyfully
joins
the
throng
of
happy
beings
who
dwell
beyond
the
reaches
of
bodily
sense
the
moral
inconsistency
of
dreams
is
glaring
mine
grow
less
and
less
accordant
with
my
proper
principles
i
am
nightly
hurled
into
an
unethical
medley
of
extremes
i
must
either
defend
another
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
or
condemn
him
past
all
repenting
i
commit
murder
sleeping
to
save
the
lives
of
others
i
ascribe
to
those
i
love
best
acts
and
words
which
it
mortifies
me
to
remember
and
i
cast
reproach
after
reproach
upon
them
it
is
fortunate
for
our
peace
of
mind
that
most
wicked
dreams
are
soon
forgotten
death
sudden
and
awful
strange
loves
and
hates
remorselessly
pursued
cunningly
plotted
revenge
are
seldom
more
than
dim
haunting
recollections
in
the
morning
and
during
the
day
they
are
erased
by
the
normal
activities
of
the
mind
sometimes
immediately
on
waking
i
am
so
vexed
at
the
memory
of
a
i
wish
i
may
dream
no
more
with
this
wish
distinctly
before
me
i
drop
off
again
into
a
new
turmoil
of
dreams
oh
dreams
what
opprobrium
i
heap
upon
you
you
the
most
pointless
things
imaginable
saucy
apes
brewers
of
odious
contrasts
haunting
birds
of
ill
omen
mocking
echoes
unseasonable
reminders
vexations
skeletons
in
my
jesters
in
the
tomb
at
the
wedding
feast
outlaws
of
the
brain
that
every
night
defy
the
mind
police
service
thieves
of
my
hesperidean
apples
breakers
of
my
domestic
peace
murderers
of
sleep
oh
dreadful
dreams
that
do
fright
my
spirit
from
her
propriety
no
wonder
that
hamlet
preferred
the
ills
he
knew
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
one
yet
remove
the
and
the
loss
is
inconceivable
the
magic
spell
which
binds
poetry
together
is
broken
the
splendour
of
art
and
the
soaring
might
of
imagination
are
lessened
because
no
phantom
of
fadeless
sunsets
and
flowers
urges
onward
to
a
goal
gone
is
the
mute
permission
or
connivance
which
emboldens
the
soul
to
mock
the
limits
of
time
and
space
forecast
and
gather
in
harvests
of
achievement
for
ages
yet
unborn
blot
out
dreams
and
the
blind
lose
one
of
their
chief
comforts
for
in
the
visions
of
sleep
they
behold
their
belief
in
the
seeing
mind
and
their
expectation
of
light
beyond
the
blank
narrow
night
justified
nay
our
conception
of
immortality
is
shaken
faith
the
of
human
life
flickers
out
before
such
vacancy
and
bareness
the
shocks
of
wrecked
worlds
were
indeed
welcome
in
truth
dreams
bring
us
the
thought
independently
of
us
and
in
spite
of
us
that
the
soul
may
right
her
nature
shoot
large
sail
on
lengthening
cord
and
rush
exultant
on
the
infinite
dreams
and
reality
xiv
dreams
and
reality
it
is
astonishing
to
think
how
our
real
world
revolves
around
the
shadowy
unrealities
of
dreamland
despite
all
that
we
say
about
the
inconsequence
of
dreams
we
often
reason
by
them
we
stake
our
greatest
hopes
upon
them
nay
we
build
upon
them
the
fabric
of
an
ideal
world
i
can
recall
few
fine
thoughtful
poems
few
noble
works
of
art
or
any
system
of
philosophy
in
which
there
is
not
evidence
that
symbolize
truths
concealed
by
phenomena
the
fact
that
in
dreams
confusion
reigns
and
illogical
connections
occur
gives
plausibility
to
the
theory
which
sir
arthur
mitchell
and
other
scientific
men
hold
that
our
is
uncontrolled
and
undirected
by
the
will
the
will
the
inhibiting
and
guiding
power
finds
rest
and
refreshment
in
sleep
while
the
mind
like
a
barque
without
rudder
or
compass
drifts
aimlessly
upon
an
uncharted
sea
but
curiously
enough
these
fantasies
and
of
thought
are
to
be
found
in
great
imaginative
poems
like
spenser
færie
queene
lamb
was
impressed
by
the
analogy
between
our
and
the
work
of
the
imagination
speaking
of
the
episode
in
the
cave
of
mammon
lamb
wrote
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
the
whole
episode
is
a
copy
of
the
conceptions
in
sleep
it
is
in
some
sort
but
what
a
copy
let
the
most
romantic
of
us
that
has
been
entertained
all
night
with
the
spectacle
of
some
wild
and
magnificent
vision
it
in
the
morning
and
try
it
by
his
waking
judgment
that
which
appeared
so
shifting
and
yet
so
coherent
when
it
came
under
cool
examination
shall
appear
so
reasonless
and
so
unlinked
that
we
are
ashamed
to
have
been
so
deluded
and
to
have
taken
though
but
in
sleep
a
monster
for
a
god
the
transitions
in
this
episode
are
every
whit
as
violent
as
in
the
most
extravagant
dream
and
yet
the
waking
judgment
ratifies
them
perhaps
i
feel
more
than
others
the
analogy
between
the
world
of
our
waking
life
and
the
world
of
dreams
because
before
i
was
taught
i
lived
in
a
sort
of
perpetual
dream
the
testimony
of
parents
and
friends
who
watched
me
day
after
day
is
the
only
means
that
i
have
of
knowing
the
actuality
of
those
early
obscure
years
of
my
childhood
the
physical
acts
of
going
to
bed
and
waking
in
the
morning
alone
mark
the
transition
from
reality
to
dreamland
as
near
as
i
can
tell
asleep
or
awake
i
only
felt
with
my
body
i
can
recollect
no
process
which
i
should
now
dignify
with
the
term
of
thought
it
is
true
that
my
bodily
sensations
were
extremely
acute
but
beyond
a
crude
connection
with
physical
wants
they
are
not
associated
or
directed
they
had
little
relation
to
each
other
to
me
or
the
experience
of
others
idea
that
which
gives
identity
and
continuity
to
experience
came
into
my
sleeping
and
waking
existence
at
the
same
moment
with
the
awakening
of
before
that
moment
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
anarchy
in
which
meaningless
sensations
rioted
and
if
thought
existed
it
was
so
vague
and
inconsequent
it
can
not
be
made
a
part
of
discourse
yet
before
my
education
began
i
dreamed
i
know
that
i
must
have
dreamed
because
i
recall
no
break
in
my
tactual
experiences
things
fell
suddenly
heavily
i
felt
my
clothing
afire
or
i
fell
into
a
tub
of
cold
water
once
i
smelt
bananas
and
the
odour
in
my
nostrils
was
so
vivid
that
in
the
morning
before
i
was
dressed
i
went
to
the
sideboard
to
look
for
the
bananas
there
were
no
bananas
and
no
odour
of
bananas
anywhere
my
life
was
in
fact
a
dream
throughout
the
likeness
between
my
waking
state
and
the
sleeping
one
is
still
marked
in
both
states
i
see
but
not
with
my
eyes
i
hear
but
not
with
my
ears
i
speak
and
am
spoken
to
without
the
sound
of
a
voice
i
am
moved
to
pleasure
by
visions
of
ineffable
beauty
which
i
have
never
beheld
in
the
physical
world
once
in
a
dream
i
held
in
my
hand
a
pearl
the
one
i
saw
in
my
dreams
must
therefore
have
been
a
creation
of
my
imagination
it
was
a
smooth
exquisitely
moulded
crystal
as
i
gazed
into
its
shimmering
deeps
my
soul
was
flooded
with
an
ecstasy
of
tenderness
and
i
was
filled
with
wonder
as
one
who
should
for
the
first
time
look
into
the
cool
sweet
heart
of
a
rose
my
pearl
was
dew
and
fire
the
velvety
green
of
moss
the
soft
whiteness
of
lilies
and
the
distilled
hues
and
sweetness
of
a
thousand
roses
it
seemed
to
me
the
soul
of
beauty
was
dissolved
in
its
crystal
bosom
this
beauteous
vision
strengthens
my
conviction
that
the
world
which
the
mind
builds
up
out
of
countless
subtle
experiences
and
suggestions
is
fairer
than
the
world
of
the
senses
the
splendour
of
the
sunset
my
friends
gaze
at
across
the
purpling
hills
is
wonderful
but
the
sunset
of
the
inner
vision
brings
purer
delight
because
it
is
the
worshipful
blending
of
all
the
beauty
that
we
have
known
and
desired
i
believe
that
i
am
more
fortunate
in
my
dreams
than
most
people
for
as
i
think
back
over
my
dreams
the
pleasant
ones
seem
to
predominate
although
we
naturally
recall
most
vividly
and
tell
most
eagerly
the
grotesque
and
fantastic
adventures
in
slumberland
i
have
friends
however
whose
dreams
are
always
troubled
and
disturbed
they
wake
fatigued
and
bruised
and
they
tell
me
that
they
would
give
a
kingdom
for
one
dreamless
night
there
is
one
friend
who
declares
that
she
has
never
had
a
felicitous
dream
in
her
life
the
grind
and
worry
of
the
day
invade
the
sweet
domain
of
sleep
and
weary
her
with
incessant
profitless
effort
i
feel
very
sorry
for
this
friend
and
perhaps
it
is
hardly
fair
to
insist
upon
the
pleasure
of
dreaming
in
the
presence
of
one
whose
is
so
unhappy
still
it
is
true
that
my
dreams
have
uses
as
many
and
sweet
as
those
of
adversity
all
my
yearning
for
the
strange
the
weird
the
ghostlike
is
gratified
in
dreams
they
carry
me
out
of
the
accustomed
and
commonplace
in
a
flash
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
they
snatch
the
burden
from
my
shoulder
the
trivial
task
from
my
hand
and
the
pain
and
disappointment
from
my
heart
and
i
behold
the
lovely
face
of
my
dream
it
dances
round
me
with
merry
measure
and
darts
hither
and
thither
in
happy
abandon
sudden
sweet
fancies
spring
forth
from
every
nook
and
corner
and
delightful
surprises
meet
me
at
every
turn
a
happy
dream
is
more
precious
than
gold
and
rubies
i
like
to
think
that
in
dreams
we
catch
glimpses
of
a
life
larger
than
our
own
we
see
it
as
a
little
child
or
as
a
savage
who
visits
a
civilized
nation
thoughts
are
imparted
to
us
far
above
our
ordinary
thinking
feelings
nobler
and
wiser
than
any
we
have
known
thrill
us
between
for
one
fleeting
night
a
princelier
nature
captures
us
and
we
become
as
great
as
our
aspirations
i
daresay
we
return
to
the
little
world
of
our
daily
activities
with
as
distorted
a
of
what
we
have
seen
as
that
of
the
african
who
visited
england
and
afterwards
said
he
had
been
in
a
huge
hill
which
carried
him
over
great
waters
the
comprehensiveness
of
our
thought
whether
we
are
asleep
or
awake
no
doubt
depends
largely
upon
our
idiosyncrasies
constitution
habits
and
mental
capacity
but
whatever
may
be
the
nature
of
our
dreams
the
mental
processes
that
characterize
them
are
analogous
to
those
which
go
on
when
the
mind
is
not
held
to
attention
by
the
will
a
waking
dream
xv
a
waking
dream
i
have
sat
for
hours
in
a
sort
of
reverie
letting
my
mind
have
its
way
without
inhibition
and
direction
and
idly
noted
down
the
incessant
beat
of
thought
upon
thought
image
upon
image
i
have
observed
that
my
thoughts
make
all
kinds
of
connections
wind
in
and
out
trace
concentric
circles
and
break
up
in
eddies
of
fantasy
just
as
in
dreams
one
day
i
had
a
literary
frolic
with
a
certain
set
of
thoughts
which
dropped
in
for
an
afternoon
call
i
wrote
for
three
or
four
hours
as
they
arrived
and
the
resulting
record
is
much
like
a
dream
i
found
that
the
most
disconnected
dissimilar
thoughts
came
in
i
dreamed
a
dream
the
difference
is
that
in
waking
dreams
i
can
look
back
upon
the
endless
succession
of
thoughts
while
in
the
dreams
of
sleep
i
can
recall
but
few
ideas
and
images
i
catch
broken
threads
from
the
warp
and
woof
of
a
pattern
i
can
not
see
or
glowing
leaves
which
have
floated
on
a
from
a
tree
that
i
can
not
identify
in
this
reverie
i
held
the
key
to
the
company
of
ideas
i
give
my
record
of
them
to
show
what
analogies
exist
between
thoughts
when
they
are
not
directed
and
the
behaviour
of
real
i
had
an
essay
to
write
i
wanted
my
mind
fresh
and
obedient
and
all
its
handmaidens
ready
to
hold
up
my
hands
in
the
task
i
intended
to
discourse
learnedly
upon
my
educational
experiences
and
i
was
unusually
anxious
to
do
my
best
i
had
a
working
plan
in
my
head
for
the
essay
which
was
to
be
grave
wise
and
abounding
in
ideas
moreover
it
was
to
have
an
academic
flavour
suggestive
of
sheepskin
and
the
reader
was
to
be
duly
impressed
with
the
austere
dignity
of
cap
and
gown
i
shut
myself
up
in
the
study
resolved
to
beat
out
on
the
keys
of
my
typewriter
this
immortal
chapter
of
my
alexander
was
no
more
confident
of
conquering
asia
with
the
splendid
army
which
his
father
philip
had
disciplined
than
i
was
of
finding
my
mental
house
in
order
and
my
thoughts
obedient
my
mind
had
had
a
long
vacation
and
i
was
now
coming
back
to
it
in
an
hour
that
it
looked
not
for
me
my
situation
was
similar
to
that
of
the
master
who
went
into
a
far
country
and
expected
on
his
home
coming
to
find
everything
as
he
left
it
but
returning
he
found
his
servants
giving
a
party
confusion
was
rampant
there
was
fiddling
and
dancing
and
the
babble
of
many
tongues
so
that
the
voice
of
the
master
could
not
be
heard
though
he
shouted
and
beat
upon
the
gate
it
remained
closed
so
it
was
with
me
i
sounded
the
trumpet
loud
and
long
but
the
vassals
of
thought
would
not
rally
to
my
standard
each
had
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
a
fair
partner
and
i
know
not
what
wild
tunes
put
life
and
mettle
into
their
heels
there
was
nothing
to
do
i
looked
about
helplessly
upon
my
great
retinue
and
realized
that
it
is
not
the
possession
of
a
thing
but
the
ability
to
use
it
which
is
of
value
i
settled
back
in
my
chair
to
watch
the
pageant
it
was
rather
pleasant
sitting
there
idle
as
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
watching
my
own
thoughts
at
play
it
was
like
thinking
fine
things
to
say
without
taking
the
trouble
to
write
them
i
felt
like
alice
in
wonderland
when
she
ran
at
full
speed
with
the
red
queen
and
never
passed
anything
or
got
anywhere
the
merry
frolic
went
on
madly
the
dancers
were
all
manner
of
thoughts
there
were
sad
thoughts
and
happy
thoughts
thoughts
suited
to
every
clime
and
weather
thoughts
bearing
the
mark
of
every
age
and
nation
silly
thoughts
and
wise
thoughts
thoughts
of
people
of
things
and
of
nothing
good
thoughts
impish
thoughts
and
large
gracious
thoughts
there
they
went
swinging
in
corkscrew
fashion
an
antic
jester
in
green
and
gold
led
the
dance
the
guests
followed
no
order
or
precedent
no
two
thoughts
were
related
to
each
other
even
by
the
fortieth
cousinship
there
was
not
so
much
as
an
international
alliance
between
them
each
thought
behaved
like
a
newly
created
poet
his
mouth
he
could
not
ope
but
there
flew
out
a
trope
magical
lyrics
oh
if
i
only
had
written
them
down
they
came
down
the
sequestered
avenues
of
my
mind
this
merry
throng
with
bacchanal
song
and
shout
they
came
and
eye
hath
not
since
beheld
confusion
worse
confounded
shut
your
eyes
and
see
them
come
the
knights
and
ladies
of
my
revel
plumed
and
turbaned
they
come
clad
in
mail
and
silken
broideries
gentle
maids
in
quaker
gray
gay
princes
in
scarlet
cloaks
coquettes
with
roses
in
their
hair
monks
in
cowls
that
might
have
covered
the
tall
minster
tower
demure
little
girls
hugging
paper
dolls
and
rollicking
with
ruddy
morning
faces
an
professor
carrying
his
shoes
under
his
arms
and
looking
wise
followed
by
cronies
fairies
goblins
and
all
the
troops
just
loosed
from
ark
they
walked
they
strutted
they
soared
they
swam
and
some
came
in
through
fire
one
sprite
climbed
up
to
the
moon
on
a
ladder
made
of
leaves
and
frozen
a
peacock
with
a
great
hooked
bill
flew
in
and
out
among
the
branches
of
a
pecking
the
rosy
fruit
he
screamed
so
loud
that
apollo
turned
in
his
chariot
of
flame
and
from
his
burnished
bow
shot
golden
arrows
at
him
this
did
not
disturb
the
peacock
in
the
least
for
he
spread
his
wings
and
flourished
his
wonderful
tail
in
the
very
face
of
the
then
came
venus
an
exact
copy
of
my
own
plaster
cast
serene
dancing
high
and
disposedly
like
queen
elizabeth
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
lovely
cupids
mounted
on
clouds
blown
hither
and
thither
by
sweet
winds
while
all
around
danced
flowers
and
streams
and
queer
little
japanese
in
pots
they
were
followed
by
jovial
pan
with
green
hair
and
jewelled
sandals
and
by
his
side
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
walked
a
modest
nun
counting
her
beads
at
a
little
distance
were
seen
three
dancers
a
lean
starved
platitude
a
rosy
dimpled
joke
and
a
sermon
on
predestination
close
upon
them
came
a
whole
string
of
nights
with
hair
and
days
with
faggots
on
their
backs
all
at
once
i
saw
the
ample
figure
of
life
rise
above
the
whirling
mass
holding
a
naked
child
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
gleaming
sword
a
bear
crouched
at
her
feet
and
all
about
her
swirled
and
glowed
a
multitudinous
host
of
tiny
atoms
which
sang
all
together
we
are
the
will
of
god
atom
wedded
atom
and
chemical
married
chemical
and
the
cosmic
dance
went
on
in
changing
changeless
measure
until
my
head
sang
like
a
just
as
i
was
thinking
i
would
leave
this
scene
of
phantoms
and
take
a
stroll
in
the
quiet
groves
of
slumber
i
noticed
a
commotion
near
one
of
the
entrances
to
my
enchanted
palace
it
was
evident
from
the
whispering
and
buzzing
that
went
round
that
more
celebrities
had
arrived
the
first
personage
i
saw
was
homer
blind
no
more
leading
by
a
golden
chain
the
ships
of
the
achaians
bobbing
their
heads
and
squawking
like
so
many
white
swans
plato
and
mother
goose
with
the
numerous
children
of
the
shoe
came
next
simple
simon
jill
and
jack
who
had
had
his
head
mended
and
the
cat
that
fell
into
the
cream
all
these
danced
in
a
giddy
reel
while
plato
solemnly
discoursed
on
the
laws
of
topsyturvy
land
then
followed
calvin
and
sappho
who
danced
a
schottische
aristophanes
and
molière
joined
for
a
measure
both
talking
at
once
molière
in
greek
and
aristophanes
in
german
i
thought
this
odd
because
it
occurred
to
me
that
german
was
a
dead
language
before
aristophanes
was
born
shelley
brought
in
a
fluttering
lark
which
burst
into
the
song
of
chaucer
chanticleer
henry
esmond
gave
his
hand
in
a
stately
minuet
to
diana
of
the
crossways
he
evidently
did
not
understand
her
nineteenth
century
wit
for
he
did
not
laugh
perhaps
he
had
lost
his
taste
for
clever
women
anon
dante
and
swedenborg
came
together
conversing
earnestly
about
things
remote
and
mystical
swedenborg
said
it
was
very
warm
dante
replied
that
it
might
rain
in
the
night
suddenly
there
was
a
great
clamour
and
i
found
that
the
battle
of
the
books
had
begun
raging
anew
two
figures
entered
in
lively
dispute
one
was
dressed
in
plain
homespun
and
the
other
wore
a
scholar
gown
over
a
suit
of
motley
i
gathered
from
their
conversation
that
they
were
cotton
mather
and
william
shakspere
mather
insisted
that
the
witches
in
macbeth
should
be
caught
and
hanged
shakspere
replied
that
the
witches
had
already
suffered
enough
at
the
hands
of
commentators
they
were
pushed
aside
by
the
twelve
knights
of
the
round
table
who
marched
in
bearing
on
a
salver
the
goose
that
laid
golden
eggs
the
mule
and
the
golden
bull
had
a
combat
of
history
and
fiction
such
as
i
had
read
of
in
books
but
never
before
witnessed
these
little
animals
were
put
to
rout
by
a
huge
elephant
which
lumbered
in
with
rudyard
kipling
riding
high
on
its
trunk
the
elephant
changed
suddenly
to
a
rakish
craft
i
do
not
know
what
a
rakish
craft
is
but
this
was
very
rakish
and
very
crafty
it
must
have
been
abandoned
long
ago
by
wild
pirates
of
the
southern
seas
for
clinging
to
the
rigging
and
jovially
cheering
as
the
ship
went
down
i
made
out
a
man
with
blazing
eyes
clad
in
a
velveteen
jacket
as
the
ship
disappeared
from
sight
falstaff
rushed
to
the
rescue
of
the
lonely
navigator
and
stole
his
purse
but
miranda
persuaded
him
to
give
it
back
stevenson
said
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
falstaff
laughed
and
called
this
a
good
joke
as
good
as
any
he
had
heard
in
his
day
this
was
the
signal
for
a
rushing
swarm
of
quotations
they
surged
to
and
fro
an
inchoate
throng
of
half
finished
phrases
mutilated
sentences
parodied
sentiments
and
brilliant
metaphors
i
could
not
distinguish
any
phrases
or
ideas
of
my
own
making
i
saw
a
poor
ragged
shrunken
sentence
that
might
have
been
mine
own
catch
the
wings
of
a
fair
idea
with
the
light
of
genius
shining
like
a
halo
about
its
head
ever
and
anon
the
dancers
changed
partners
without
invitation
or
permission
thoughts
fell
in
love
at
sight
married
in
a
measure
and
joined
hands
without
previous
courtship
an
incongruity
is
the
wedding
of
two
thoughts
which
have
had
no
reasonable
courtship
and
marriages
without
wooing
are
apt
to
lead
to
domestic
discord
even
to
the
breaking
up
of
an
ancient
family
among
the
wedded
couples
were
certain
similes
hitherto
inviolable
in
their
bachelorhood
and
spinsterhood
and
held
in
great
respect
their
extraordinary
proceedings
nearly
broke
up
the
dance
but
the
fatuity
of
their
union
was
evident
to
them
and
they
parted
other
similes
seemed
to
have
the
habit
of
living
in
discord
they
had
been
many
times
married
and
divorced
they
belonged
to
the
notorious
society
of
mixed
metaphors
a
company
of
phantoms
floated
in
and
out
wearing
tantalizing
garments
of
oblivion
they
seemed
about
to
dance
then
vanished
they
reappeared
half
a
dozen
times
but
never
unveiled
their
faces
the
imp
curiosity
pulled
memory
by
the
sleeve
and
said
why
do
they
run
away
is
strange
knavery
out
ran
memory
to
capture
them
after
a
great
deal
of
racing
and
puffing
and
collision
it
apprehended
some
of
the
fugitives
and
brought
them
in
but
when
it
tore
off
their
masks
lo
some
were
disappointingly
commonplace
and
others
were
gipsy
quotations
trying
to
conceal
the
punctuation
marks
that
belonged
to
them
memory
was
much
chagrined
to
have
had
such
a
hard
chase
only
to
catch
this
sorry
lot
of
graceless
rogues
into
the
rabble
strode
four
stately
giants
who
called
themselves
history
philosophy
law
and
medicine
they
seemed
too
solemn
and
imposing
to
join
in
a
masque
but
even
as
i
gazed
at
these
formidable
guests
they
all
split
into
fragments
which
went
whirling
dancing
in
divisions
subdivisions
of
scientific
nonsense
history
split
into
philology
ethnology
anthropology
and
mythology
and
these
again
split
finer
than
the
splitting
of
hairs
each
speciality
hugged
its
bit
of
knowledge
and
waltzed
it
round
and
round
the
rest
of
the
company
began
to
nod
and
i
felt
drowsy
myself
to
put
an
end
to
the
solemn
gyrations
a
troop
of
fairies
mercifully
waved
poppies
over
us
all
the
masque
faded
my
head
fell
and
i
started
sleep
had
wakened
me
at
my
elbow
i
found
my
old
friend
bottom
bottom
i
said
i
have
had
a
dream
past
the
wit
of
man
to
say
what
dream
it
was
methought
i
was
there
is
no
man
can
tell
what
the
eye
of
man
hath
not
heard
the
ear
of
man
hath
not
seen
his
hand
is
not
able
to
taste
his
tongue
to
conceive
nor
his
heart
to
report
what
my
dream
was
a
chant
of
darkness
a
chant
of
darkness
wings
are
folded
mine
ears
my
wings
are
crossèd
mine
eyes
yet
through
their
silver
shade
appears
and
through
their
lulling
plumes
arise
a
shape
a
throng
of
prometheus
unbound
i
dare
not
ask
why
we
are
reft
of
light
banished
to
our
solitary
isles
amid
the
unmeasured
seas
or
how
our
sight
was
nurtured
to
glorious
vision
to
fade
and
vanish
and
leave
us
in
the
dark
alone
the
secret
of
god
is
upon
our
tabernacle
into
his
mystery
i
dare
not
pry
only
this
i
know
with
him
is
strength
with
him
is
wisdom
and
his
wisdom
hath
set
darkness
in
our
paths
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
o
dark
thou
awful
sweet
and
holy
dark
in
thy
solemn
spaces
beyond
the
human
eye
god
fashioned
his
universe
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
laid
the
measure
thereof
and
stretched
the
line
upon
it
shut
up
the
sea
with
doors
and
made
the
glory
of
the
clouds
a
covering
for
it
commanded
his
morning
and
behold
chaos
fled
before
the
uplifted
face
of
the
sun
divided
a
for
the
overflowing
of
waters
sent
rain
upon
the
earth
upon
the
wilderness
wherein
there
was
no
man
upon
the
desert
where
grew
no
tender
herb
and
lo
there
was
greenness
upon
the
plains
and
the
hills
were
clothed
with
beauty
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
o
dark
thou
secret
and
inscrutable
dark
in
thy
silent
depths
the
springs
whereof
man
hath
not
fathomed
god
wrought
the
soul
of
man
o
dark
compassionate
dark
tenderly
as
shadows
to
the
evening
comes
thy
message
to
man
softly
thou
layest
thy
hand
on
his
tired
eyelids
and
his
soul
weary
and
homesick
returns
unto
thy
soothing
embrace
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
o
dark
wise
vital
dark
in
thy
mystery
thou
hidest
the
light
that
is
the
soul
life
upon
thy
solitary
shores
i
walk
unafraid
i
dread
no
evil
though
i
walk
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
i
shall
not
know
the
ecstasy
of
fear
when
gentle
death
leads
me
through
life
open
door
when
the
bands
of
night
are
sundered
and
the
day
outpours
its
light
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
the
timid
soul
shuns
the
dark
but
upon
the
cheeks
of
him
who
must
abide
in
shadow
breathes
the
wind
of
rushing
and
round
him
falls
a
light
from
unseen
fires
magical
beams
glow
athwart
the
darkness
paths
of
beauty
wind
through
his
black
world
to
another
world
of
light
where
no
veil
of
sense
shuts
him
out
from
paradise
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
o
dark
thou
blessèd
quiet
dark
to
the
lone
exile
who
must
dwell
with
thee
thou
art
benign
and
friendly
from
the
harsh
world
thou
dost
shut
him
in
to
him
thou
whisperest
the
secrets
of
the
wondrous
night
upon
him
thou
bestowest
regions
wide
and
boundless
as
his
spirit
thou
givest
a
glory
to
all
humble
things
with
thy
hovering
pinions
thou
coverest
all
unlovely
objects
under
thy
brooding
wings
there
is
peace
of
the
uncharted
unthinkable
dark
we
came
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
return
again
into
the
vast
unanswering
ii
once
in
regions
void
of
light
i
wandered
in
blank
darkness
i
stumbled
and
fear
led
me
by
the
hand
my
feet
pressed
earthward
afraid
of
pitfalls
by
many
shapeless
terrors
of
the
night
affrighted
to
the
wakeful
day
i
held
out
beseeching
arms
then
came
love
bearing
in
her
hand
the
torch
that
is
the
light
unto
my
feet
and
softly
spoke
love
hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
darkness
hast
thou
entered
into
the
treasures
of
the
night
search
out
thy
blindness
it
holdeth
riches
past
computing
the
words
of
love
set
my
spirit
aflame
my
eager
fingers
searched
out
the
mysteries
the
splendours
the
inmost
sacredness
of
things
and
in
the
vacancies
discerned
with
spiritual
sense
the
fullness
of
life
and
the
gates
of
day
stood
wide
i
am
shaken
with
gladness
my
limbs
tremble
with
joy
my
heart
and
the
earth
tremble
with
happiness
the
ecstasy
of
life
is
abroad
in
the
world
knowledge
hath
uncurtained
heaven
on
the
uttermost
shores
of
darkness
there
is
light
midnight
hath
sent
forth
a
beam
the
blind
that
stumbled
in
darkness
without
light
behold
a
new
day
in
the
obscurity
gleams
the
star
of
thought
imagination
hath
a
luminous
eye
and
the
mind
hath
a
glorious
vision
iii
the
man
is
blind
what
is
life
to
him
a
closed
book
held
up
against
a
sightless
face
would
that
he
could
see
yon
beauteous
star
and
know
for
one
transcendent
moment
the
palpitating
joy
of
sight
all
sight
is
of
the
soul
behold
it
in
the
upward
flight
of
the
unfettered
spirit
hast
thou
seen
thought
bloom
in
the
blind
child
face
hast
thou
seen
his
mind
grow
like
the
running
dawn
to
grasp
the
vision
of
the
master
it
was
the
miracle
of
inward
sight
in
the
realms
of
wonderment
where
i
dwell
i
explore
life
with
my
hands
i
recognize
and
am
happy
my
fingers
are
ever
athirst
for
the
earth
and
drink
up
its
wonders
with
delight
draw
out
earth
dear
delights
my
feet
are
charged
with
the
murmur
the
throb
of
all
things
that
grow
this
is
touch
this
quivering
this
flame
this
ether
this
glad
rush
of
blood
this
daylight
in
my
heart
this
glow
of
sympathy
in
my
palms
thou
blind
loving
touch
thou
openest
the
book
of
life
to
me
the
noiseless
little
noises
of
the
earth
come
with
softest
rustle
the
shy
sweet
feet
of
life
the
silky
mutter
of
against
my
restraining
palm
the
strident
beat
of
the
silvery
trickle
of
water
little
breezes
busy
in
the
summer
grass
the
music
of
crisp
whisking
scurrying
leaves
the
swirling
leaves
the
crystal
splash
of
summer
rain
saturate
with
the
odours
of
the
sod
with
alert
fingers
i
listen
to
the
showers
of
sound
that
the
wind
shakes
from
the
forest
i
bathe
in
the
liquid
shade
under
the
pines
where
the
air
hangs
cool
after
the
shower
is
done
my
saucy
little
friend
the
squirrel
flips
my
shoulder
with
his
tail
leaps
from
leafy
billow
to
leafy
billow
returns
to
eat
his
breakfast
from
my
hand
between
us
there
is
glad
sympathy
he
gambols
my
pulses
dance
i
am
exultingly
full
of
the
joy
of
life
have
not
my
fingers
split
the
sand
on
the
beach
hath
not
my
naked
body
felt
the
water
sing
when
the
sea
hath
enveloped
it
with
rippling
music
have
i
not
felt
the
lilt
of
waves
beneath
my
boat
the
flap
of
sail
the
strain
of
mast
the
wild
rush
of
the
winds
have
i
not
smelt
the
swift
keen
flight
of
winged
odours
before
the
tempest
here
is
joy
awake
aglow
here
is
the
tumult
of
the
heart
my
hands
evoke
sight
and
sound
out
of
feeling
intershifting
the
senses
endlessly
linking
motion
with
sight
odour
with
sound
they
give
colour
to
the
honeyed
breeze
the
measure
and
passion
of
a
symphony
to
the
beat
and
quiver
of
unseen
wings
in
the
secrets
of
earth
and
sun
and
air
my
fingers
are
wise
they
snatch
light
out
of
darkness
they
thrill
to
harmonies
breathed
in
silence
i
walked
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
my
soul
uttered
her
gladness
o
night
still
odorous
night
i
love
thee
o
wide
spacious
night
i
love
thee
o
steadfast
glorious
night
i
touch
thee
with
my
hands
i
lean
against
thy
strength
i
am
comforted
o
fathomless
soothing
night
thou
art
a
balm
to
my
restless
spirit
i
nestle
gratefully
in
thy
bosom
dark
gracious
mother
like
a
dove
i
rest
in
thy
bosom
